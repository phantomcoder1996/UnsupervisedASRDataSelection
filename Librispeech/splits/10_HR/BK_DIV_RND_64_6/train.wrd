FIGURE SAID THE MOCK TURTLE TO THE GRYPHON WE CAN DO WITHOUT LOBSTERS YOU KNOW WHICH SHALL SING OH YOU SING
THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF OF THE MUSHROOM SAID THE CATERPILLAR JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE
HOWEVER I'VE GOT BACK TO MY RIGHT SIZE THE NEXT THING IS TO GET INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL GARDEN HOW IS THAT TO BE DONE I WONDER AS SHE SAID THIS SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON AN OPEN PLACE WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH
SO THEY HAD TO FALL A LONG WAY SO THEY GOT THEIR TAILS FAST IN THEIR MOUTHS SO THEY COULDN'T GET THEM OUT AGAIN THAT'S ALL
AND PUNCHING HIM IN THE BACK AT LAST THE MOCK TURTLE RECOVERED HIS VOICE AND WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS HE WENT ON AGAIN
WELL I SHAN'T GO AT ANY RATE SAID ALICE BESIDES THAT'S NOT A REGULAR RULE YOU INVENTED IT JUST NOW IT'S THE OLDEST RULE IN THE BOOK SAID THE KING
TOO CLOSE AND WAVING THEIR FOREPAWS TO MARK THE TIME
AND THIS ALICE WOULD NOT ALLOW WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OLD IT WAS AND AS THE LORY POSITIVELY REFUSED TO TELL ITS AGE
THE KING HASTILY SAID AND WENT ON TO HIMSELF IN AN UNDERTONE IMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT IMPORTANT AS IF HE WERE TRYING WHICH WORD SOUNDED BEST SOME OF THE JURY WROTE IT DOWN IMPORTANT AND SOME UNIMPORTANT
I CAN SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING I I'M A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALICE RATHER DOUBTFULLY AS SHE REMEMBERED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT DAY A LIKELY STORY INDEED SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT
POINTING TO ALICE WITH ONE FINGER AND THE WHOLE PARTY AT ONCE CROWDED ROUND HER CALLING OUT IN A CONFUSED WAY PRIZES PRIZES
THE CATERPILLAR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK WHAT SIZE DO YOU WANT TO BE IT ASKED OH I'M NOT PARTICULAR AS TO SIZE ALICE HASTILY REPLIED ONLY ONE DOESN'T LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN YOU KNOW
AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
AND THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON AND ALL THE OTHER QUEER NOISES WOULD CHANGE SHE KNEW TO THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF THE BUSY FARM YARD WHILE THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TURTLE'S HEAVY SOBS
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
FEELING VERY GLAD THAT IT WAS OVER AT LAST AND I DO SO LIKE THAT CURIOUS SONG ABOUT THE WHITING OH
SAID ALICE THE KING TURNED PALE AND SHUT HIS NOTE BOOK HASTILY CONSIDER YOUR VERDICT HE SAID TO THE JURY IN A LOW TREMBLING VOICE THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE TO COME YET PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE WHITE RABBIT JUMPING UP IN A GREAT HURRY
COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR
AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN
NO WISE FISH WOULD GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT A PORPOISE WOULDN'T IT REALLY
THAT GENERALLY TAKES SOME TIME INTERRUPTED THE GRYPHON YOU ADVANCE TWICE EACH WITH A LOBSTER AS A PARTNER
WE BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ELEGANT THIMBLE AND WHEN IT HAD FINISHED THIS SHORT SPEECH THEY ALL CHEERED
THE GRYPHON REPLIED VERY SOLEMNLY ALICE WAS THOROUGHLY PUZZLED DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES SHE REPEATED IN A WONDERING TONE
THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT COME MY HEAD'S FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT
AND OH I WISH YOU COULD SEE HER AFTER THE BIRDS WHY SHE'LL EAT A LITTLE BIRD AS SOON AS LOOK AT IT
AND FIND A PLEASURE IN ALL THEIR SIMPLE JOYS
AS IF IT THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY OUGHT TO SPEAK AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMED INCLINED TO SAY ANYTHING
I HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT PRESENT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
CHAPTER TEN
AND SEE THAT QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD TO KEEP BACK THE WANDERING HAIR THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HER EYES AND STILL AS SHE LISTENED OR SEEMED TO LISTEN THE WHOLE PLACE AROUND HER BECAME ALIVE WITH THE STRANGE CREATURES OF HER LITTLE SISTER'S DREAM
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THE CRUMBS SAID THE MOCK TURTLE CRUMBS WOULD ALL WASH OFF IN THE SEA
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER
SAT DOWN AGAIN VERY SADLY AND QUIETLY AND LOOKED AT ALICE IT MUST BE A VERY PRETTY DANCE SAID ALICE TIMIDLY
SAID THE LORY WITH A SHIVER I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE MOUSE FROWNING BUT VERY POLITELY DID YOU SPEAK NOT I SAID THE LORY HASTILY
ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASN'T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY
BUT THEY HAVE THEIR TAILS IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THE REASON IS HERE THE MOCK TURTLE YAWNED AND SHUT HIS EYES
ALWAYS READY TO MAKE HERSELF USEFUL AND LOOKING ANXIOUSLY ABOUT HER OH DO LET ME HELP TO UNDO IT I SHALL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID THE MOUSE
AS TO THE WHITING SAID THE MOCK TURTLE THEY YOU'VE SEEN THEM OF COURSE YES SAID ALICE I'VE OFTEN SEEN THEM AT DINN SHE CHECKED HERSELF HASTILY
THEN TURN NOT PALE BELOVED SNAIL BUT COME AND JOIN THE DANCE WILL YOU WON'T YOU WILL YOU WON'T YOU
AND WHY IT IS YOU HATE C AND D SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER HALF AFRAID THAT IT WOULD BE OFFENDED AGAIN
WHAT IS A CAUCUS RACE SAID ALICE NOT THAT SHE WANTED MUCH TO KNOW BUT THE DODO HAD PAUSED
HER SISTER KISSED HER AND SAID IT WAS A CURIOUS DREAM DEAR CERTAINLY
CHAPTER FIVE ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH

FOR NEITHER VARIOUS STYLE NOR HOLY RAPTURE WANTED THEY TO PRAISE THIR MAKER IN FIT STRAINS PRONOUNC'T OR SUNG UNMEDITATED SUCH PROMPT ELOQUENCE FLOWD FROM THIR LIPS
AT HIS COMMAND THE UPROOTED HILLS RETIR'D EACH TO HIS PLACE THEY HEARD HIS VOICE AND WENT OBSEQUIOUS
WE SHOULD COMPEL THEM TO A QUICK RESULT
IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
NOISE OF HAMMERING FROM THE PIT WAS HEARD BY MANY PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE THE STATE OF THINGS ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE CENTRE STICKING INTO THE SKIN OF OUR OLD PLANET EARTH LIKE A POISONED DART WAS THIS CYLINDER
A SINGLE ROUND DRUM AT THE BACK OF THE HEAD BODY AND EYES WITH A VISUAL RANGE NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS EXCEPT THAT ACCORDING TO PHILIPS BLUE AND VIOLET WERE AS BLACK TO THEM
SUCH QUASI MUSCLES ABOUNDED IN THE CRABLIKE HANDLING MACHINE WHICH ON MY FIRST PEEPING OUT OF THE SLIT I WATCHED UNPACKING THE CYLINDER IT SEEMED INFINITELY MORE ALIVE THAN THE ACTUAL MARTIANS LYING BEYOND IT IN THE SUNSET LIGHT PANTING STIRRING INEFFECTUAL TENTACLES
THAT HAD KEPT OUR RUINOUS REFUGE QUIVERING
TRANSFIXED BY A STICK THAT KEPT IT IN PLACE IT WAS THE PLACARD OF THE FIRST NEWSPAPER TO RESUME PUBLICATION THE DAILY MAIL I BOUGHT A COPY FOR A BLACKENED SHILLING I FOUND IN MY POCKET
HOW ARE WE TO GET TO LEATHERHEAD SHE SAID
OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT CIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THE HEAVY BEATING SOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREEN VAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLE
AND I ASSERT THAT I WATCHED THEM CLOSELY TIME AFTER TIME AND THAT I HAVE SEEN FOUR FIVE AND ONCE SIX OF THEM SLUGGISHLY PERFORMING THE MOST ELABORATELY COMPLICATED OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITHOUT EITHER SOUND OR GESTURE THEIR PECULIAR HOOTING
I WAS STARTLED HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING OUT AND THERE
AND AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS STREAMER OF SMOKE
AND FEEBLE MUSCULATURE STANDING ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND HAVING ROUND ERECT HEADS AND LARGE EYES IN FLINTY SOCKETS TWO OR THREE OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN EACH CYLINDER AND ALL WERE KILLED BEFORE EARTH WAS REACHED IT WAS JUST AS WELL FOR THEM
OF ALL THE STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED UPON THAT FRIDAY WAS THE DOVETAILING OF THE COMMONPLACE HABITS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER WITH THE FIRST BEGINNINGS OF THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WAS TO TOPPLE THAT SOCIAL ORDER HEADLONG
INVARIABLY PRECEDED FEEDING IT HAD NO MODULATION AND WAS I BELIEVE IN NO SENSE A SIGNAL BUT MERELY THE EXPIRATION OF AIR PREPARATORY TO THE SUCTIONAL OPERATION I HAVE A CERTAIN CLAIM TO AT LEAST AN ELEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY
THE BEECH TREES BELOW THE HOUSE WERE BURNING WHILE I DID THIS AND THE PALINGS UP THE ROAD GLOWED RED WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE DISMOUNTED HUSSARS CAME RUNNING UP HE WAS GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WARNING PEOPLE TO LEAVE
AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED IT IS NO USE SAID A VOICE THE HOUSE IS DESERTED NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYS DO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOU
A RED GLOW AND A THIN VEIL OF SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE STARS AND THOUGHT THAT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A HEATH FIRE WAS HAPPENING IT WAS ONLY ROUND THE EDGE OF THE COMMON THAT ANY DISTURBANCE WAS PERCEPTIBLE
THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
INTO THE RECIPIENT CANAL THE BARE IDEA OF THIS IS NO DOUBT HORRIBLY REPULSIVE TO US
AND SILENT ELOQUENT LIPS HE WANTED THE SLIT WHICH PERMITTED ONLY ONE OF US TO PEEP THROUGH AND SO I HAD TO FOREGO WATCHING THEM FOR A TIME WHILE HE ENJOYED THAT PRIVILEGE WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY DID TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF WORK AS EVEN ON EARTH IS PERHAPS THE CASE WITH THE ANTS IN THE NEXT PLACE WONDERFUL AS IT SEEMS IN A SEXUAL WORLD THE MARTIANS WERE ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEX
EVEN AS I SAW THESE MARTIANS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO RAISE THEMSELVES ON THESE HANDS BUT OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASED WEIGHT OF TERRESTRIAL CONDITIONS THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ON MARS THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED UPON THEM WITH SOME FACILITY
THE CHURCH BELLS THAT HAD CEASED A FORTNIGHT SINCE SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE NEWS UNTIL ALL ENGLAND WAS BELL RINGING MEN ON CYCLES LEAN FACED UNKEMPT SCORCHED ALONG EVERY COUNTRY LANE SHOUTING OF UNHOPED DELIVERANCE
IS OF A VIVID BLOOD RED TINT AT ANY RATE THE SEEDS WHICH THE MARTIANS INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY BROUGHT WITH THEM GAVE RISE IN ALL CASES TO RED COLOURED GROWTHS ONLY THAT KNOWN POPULARLY AS THE RED WEED HOWEVER
THE EARTH ALL ROUND IT HAD SPLASHED UNDER THAT TREMENDOUS IMPACT SPLASHED IS THE ONLY WORD AND LAY IN HEAPED PILES THAT HID THE MASSES OF THE ADJACENT HOUSES IT HAD BEHAVED EXACTLY LIKE MUD UNDER THE VIOLENT BLOW OF A HAMMER OUR HOUSE HAD COLLAPSED BACKWARD
ONE OF OUR CHIMNEYS CRACKED AS IF A SHOT HAD HIT IT FLEW AND A PIECE OF IT CAME CLATTERING DOWN THE TILES
SHOT WITH THREADS OF RED FIRE WERE DRIVING UP INTO THE STILL AIR AND THROWING DARK SHADOWS UPON THE GREEN TREETOPS EASTWARD THE SMOKE ALREADY EXTENDED FAR AWAY TO THE EAST AND WEST TO THE BYFLEET PINE WOODS EASTWARD
I TOOK CARE TO HAVE THE CART THERE AND THEN DROVE IT OFF DOWN THE ROAD AND LEAVING IT IN CHARGE OF MY WIFE AND SERVANT RUSHED INTO MY HOUSE AND PACKED A FEW VALUABLES SUCH PLATE AS WE HAD AND SO FORTH
A CURIOUS CROWD LINGERED RESTLESSLY PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BUT THE CROWD REMAINING
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY REVERT TO THE MATTER OF THE FOOD I WITHHELD FROM HIM PRAYING BEGGING WEEPING AT LAST THREATENING HE BEGAN TO RAISE HIS VOICE I PRAYED HIM NOT TO HE PERCEIVED A HOLD ON ME
THE RINGING IMPACT OF TRUCKS THE SHARP WHISTLE OF THE ENGINES FROM THE JUNCTION MINGLED WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF MEN FROM MARS EXCITED MEN CAME INTO THE STATION ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK WITH INCREDIBLE TIDINGS
THE BUILDING HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY SMASHED PULVERISED AND DISPERSED BY THE BLOW THE CYLINDER LAY NOW FAR BENEATH THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONS DEEP IN A HOLE ALREADY VASTLY LARGER THAN THE PIT I HAD LOOKED INTO AT WOKING
IN A GROUP ROUND THE MOUTH WERE SIXTEEN SLENDER ALMOST WHIPLIKE TENTACLES ARRANGED IN TWO BUNCHES OF EIGHT EACH THESE BUNCHES HAVE SINCE BEEN NAMED RATHER APTLY BY THAT DISTINGUISHED ANATOMIST PROFESSOR HOWES THE HANDS
IN A LONG DEFUNCT PUBLICATION THE PALL MALL BUDGET AND I RECALL A CARICATURE OF IT IN A PRE MARTIAN PERIODICAL CALLED PUNCH HE POINTED OUT WRITING IN A FOOLISH FACETIOUS TONE
SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS
SQUEAMISH AS I MAY SEEM I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DESCRIBE WHAT I COULD NOT ENDURE EVEN TO CONTINUE WATCHING LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY BLOOD OBTAINED FROM A STILL LIVING ANIMAL IN MOST CASES FROM A HUMAN BEING WAS RUN DIRECTLY BY MEANS OF A LITTLE PIPETTE
OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITING TABLE STILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HAD LEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER
THE RUDIMENTARY PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP OUR IMPRISONMENT ENDURABLE HE WOULD NOT OBSERVE SLOWLY I BEGAN TO REALISE THE COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF HIS INTELLIGENCE TO PERCEIVE THAT MY SOLE COMPANION IN THIS CLOSE AND SICKLY DARKNESS WAS A MAN INSANE
YOU CARN TELL WHAT THEY MIGHT DO WHERE'S YOUR SHELLS SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER THERE AIN'T NO TIME
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILL IMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS OR THE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYE WITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPON SCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITY I RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION
I WENT IN AGAIN ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE TO GET MY SERVANT'S BOX LUGGED IT OUT
PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE WONDERFUL TO A MAN THAN THE CURIOUS FACT THAT WHAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF ALMOST ALL HUMAN DEVICES IN MECHANISM IS ABSENT THE WHEEL IS ABSENT
AT THE TIME WHEN I STOOD UPON THE VERGE OF THE PIT ALREADY MEN WEEPING WITH JOY AS I HAVE HEARD SHOUTING AND STAYING THEIR WORK TO SHAKE HANDS AND SHOUT WERE MAKING UP TRAINS EVEN AS NEAR AS CREWE TO DESCEND UPON LONDON
SOMETHING OF MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS OF BATTLE AND HEROISM CAME BACK
WITH THAT REALISATION MY INTEREST SHIFTED TO THOSE OTHER CREATURES THE REAL MARTIANS
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
WHICH WAS FULL OF AIRY SHADOWS AND WAVERING GOLDEN LIGHTS WE'LL DECORATE THE PARLOR FIRST WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
I BELIEVE IT HAS COME ALREADY FOR GRANDMA IS KEEPING THE BOOKCASE DRAWER LOCKED AND THAT IS SOMETHING NEW AND WHEN I ASKED HER WHY SHE JUST LOOKED MYSTERIOUS AND SAID LITTLE BOYS MUSTN'T BE TOO CURIOUS IT'S VERY EXCITING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY ISN'T IT
IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR
WHILE THE TWILIGHT RAINED DOWN OUT OF A DAPPLED SKY I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT MISSUS MORGAN SHOULD REALLY COME BUT THERE THAT SPEECH SOUNDS AS PESSIMISTIC AS MISS ELIZA ANDREWS AND I'M ASHAMED OF MAKING IT
WAS A RATHER RESERVED MAN WITH A DEEP AND TENDER NATURE WHICH HE KEPT HIDDEN SCRUPULOUSLY FROM THE WORLD FATHER'S NOT VERY EASY TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH PAUL HAD SAID ONCE I NEVER GOT REALLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM UNTIL AFTER MY LITTLE MOTHER DIED
SAINT CLAIR SAYS HE CAN HIT THE HARDEST BUT PAUL CAN HIT THE OFTENEST PAUL'S LETTER MY DEAR TEACHER YOU TOLD US WE MIGHT WRITE YOU ABOUT SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE WE KNEW I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MY ROCK PEOPLE
APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
NOW HAPPILY OVER OF HER LITTLE SON BUT MISSUS ALLAN'S DIMPLES WERE AS SWEET AND SUDDEN AS EVER HER EYES AS CLEAR AND BRIGHT AND TRUE AND WHAT HER FACE LACKED OF GIRLISH BEAUTY WAS NOW MORE THAN ATONED FOR IN ADDED TENDERNESS AND STRENGTH
A MOONGLADE IS THE TRACK THE FULL MOON MAKES ON THE WATER WHEN IT IS RISING FROM THE SEA YOU KNOW TEACHER WELL THE YOUNGEST TWIN SAILOR SAILED ALONG THE MOONGLADE TILL HE CAME RIGHT UP TO THE MOON
I'VE PRAYED EVERY NIGHT THAT GOD WOULD GIVE ME ENOUGH GRACE TO ENABLE ME TO EAT EVERY BIT OF MY PORRIDGE IN THE MORNINGS
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
BUT I CAN'T HELP LOVING PAUL IRVING THE BEST OF ALL MINE I DON'T THINK IT DOES ANY HARM THOUGH FOR EVERYBODY LOVES PAUL EVEN MISSUS LYNDE WHO SAYS SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED SHE'D GET SO FOND OF A YANKEE THE OTHER BOYS IN SCHOOL LIKE HIM TOO
SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
WHEN I WAS HELPING AUNT MARY WITH THE DINNER DISHES I DROPPED A CHINA PLATE AND IT SMASHED THAT EVENING I FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE AND HAD TO STAY IN BED FOR A WEEK I HEARD AUNT MARY TELL UNCLE JOSEPH IT WAS A MERCY OR I'D HAVE BROKEN EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE
I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
IT IS JUST THAT HE HAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TACT OR IMAGINATION DEAR MISS SHIRLEY YOU TOLD US TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING STRANGE WE HAVE SEEN I WILL DESCRIBE THE AVONLEA HALL IT HAS TWO DOORS AN INSIDE ONE AND AN OUTSIDE ONE
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
YOU KNOW TEACHER I WISH SHE WOULD LEAVE THE LAMP IN MY ROOM TILL I GO TO SLEEP THOUGH SHE TAKES IT RIGHT OUT AS SOON AS SHE TUCKS ME UP BECAUSE SHE SAYS I MUSTN'T BE A COWARD I'M NOT SCARED BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE LIGHT
THE EVENING BEFORE SHE HAD MADE A PILGRIMAGE BACK TO THE LITTLE DESERTED GARDEN IN THE WOODS AND BROUGHT THEREFROM SOME OF HESTER'S OWN WHITE ROSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS DEAR SHE SAID SOFTLY
ANNE PUT ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THE FLOWERS SHE HAD BROUGHT FOR IT AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE LITTLE POPLAR SHADED CORNER WHERE HESTER GRAY SLEPT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE SPRING PICNIC ANNE HAD PUT FLOWERS ON HESTER'S GRAVE WHEN SHE VISITED MATTHEW'S
AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR WHIPPING ANTHONY NONSENSE DEAR HE DESERVED IT AND IT AGREED WITH HIM YOU HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH HIM SINCE AND HE HAS COME TO THINK THERE'S NOBODY LIKE YOU
YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
FOR YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOULDERS HE HAS BUT SOMETIMES CONCLUDED PAUL WITH A SIGH AND A MEDITATIVE AIR I REALLY THINK PORRIDGE WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME ANNE PERMITTED HERSELF A SMILE SINCE PAUL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
OR SOME INTERESTING THING OR PERSON THEY HAD SEEN THEY WERE TO WRITE THE LETTERS ON REAL NOTE PAPER SEAL THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESS THEM TO ME ALL WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE LAST FRIDAY MORNING I FOUND A PILE OF LETTERS ON MY DESK AND THAT EVENING I REALIZED AFRESH
IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
BUT IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT IT'S SURE TO POP OUT ANNE IF I WERE TO SAY I SEEN BEFORE MISSUS MORGAN I'D DIE OF MORTIFICATION AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT A GOOD MANY THINGS SAID ANNE
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED
TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
THE OLDEST TWIN CAME SAILING OVER THE SEA IN AN ENCHANTED BOAT AND I GOT IN HER THE BOAT WAS ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWY LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE MUSSEL SHELLS AND HER SAIL WAS LIKE MOONSHINE WELL WE SAILED RIGHT ACROSS TO THE SUNSET
HE HAD SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN THE MOON BUT IT WOULD MAKE THIS LETTER TOO LONG TO TELL THEM THEN THERE IS THE GOLDEN LADY OF THE CAVE ONE DAY I FOUND A BIG CAVE DOWN ON THE SHORE AND I WENT AWAY IN AND AFTER A WHILE I FOUND THE GOLDEN LADY
THERE'S NOTHING MEAN ABOUT GRANDMA I CAN TELL YOU EVER SINCE YOU AND I HAD THAT TALK ABOUT PRAYING GOING HOME FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL THAT DAY TEACHER WHEN YOU SAID WE OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES
AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
ON THEIR REACHING THE COURTYARD HE INSTINCTIVELY ALTERED HIS TREAD AS BEING IN EXPECTATION OF A DRAWBRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS NO DRAWBRIDGE AND HE SAW THE CARRIAGE WAITING IN THE OPEN STREET HE DROPPED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND AND CLASPED HIS HEAD AGAIN
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
HE TOOK HER HAIR INTO HIS HAND AGAIN AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT IT IT IS THE SAME HOW CAN IT BE WHEN WAS IT HOW WAS IT AS THE CONCENTRATED EXPRESSION RETURNED TO HIS FOREHEAD
HE RETURNED THE ANSWER IN GREAT TROUBLE AND VERY SLOWLY TRY THEM AGAIN THE HOURS BETWEEN THIS AND TO MORROW AFTERNOON ARE FEW AND SHORT BUT TRY I INTEND TO TRY I WILL NOT REST A MOMENT
FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP MUCH INTERESTED AND AGITATED MISTER LORRY SAID
WEEP FOR IT AND IF WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU OF MY NAME AND OF MY FATHER WHO IS LIVING AND OF MY MOTHER WHO IS DEAD
BUT INDEED AT THAT TIME PUTTING TO DEATH WAS A RECIPE MUCH IN VOGUE WITH ALL TRADES AND PROFESSIONS AND NOT LEAST OF ALL WITH TELLSON'S DEATH IS NATURE'S REMEDY FOR ALL THINGS AND WHY NOT LEGISLATION'S
AT ANOTHER TIME YOU SHALL KNOW MY NAME AND WHO MY MOTHER WAS AND WHO MY FATHER AND HOW I NEVER KNEW THEIR HARD HARD HISTORY BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU AT THIS TIME AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HERE ALL THAT I MAY TELL YOU HERE AND NOW IS
OFTEN ENOUGH ALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE SEEN OUR SISTER WOMEN SUFFER IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR CHILDREN POVERTY NAKEDNESS HUNGER THIRST SICKNESS
AND THE LAST FINISHING BLOWS HAD TOLD MIGHTILY ON THE EXPRESSION MADAME DEFARGE SAT OBSERVING IT WITH SUCH SUPPRESSED APPROVAL AS WAS TO BE DESIRED IN THE LEADER OF THE SAINT ANTOINE WOMEN ONE OF HER SISTERHOOD KNITTED BESIDE HER
NOT EVEN BY THE DEAREST ONE EVER TO BE KNOWN TO YOU MISTER CARTON SHE ANSWERED AFTER AN AGITATED PAUSE THE SECRET IS YOURS NOT MINE AND I PROMISE TO RESPECT IT THANK YOU AND AGAIN
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE REPEATED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND ANGRILY YES I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE TO BE NOT THE FACE OF A TRUE FRIEND OF THE REPUBLIC LET HIM TAKE CARE OF HIS FACE
BUT THAT DREADFUL WOMAN SEEMS TO THROW A SHADOW ON ME AND ON ALL MY HOPES TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY WHAT IS THIS DESPONDENCY IN THE BRAVE LITTLE BREAST A SHADOW INDEED NO SUBSTANCE IN IT LUCIE
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
THAT BROTHER WAS MY BROTHER THAT FATHER WAS MY FATHER
YET MORE TENDERLY AND STRONGLY TO THE HOME YOU SO ADORN THE DEAREST TIES THAT WILL EVER GRACE AND GLADDEN YOU
SAY THEN MY HUSBAND WHAT IS IT NEWS FROM THE OTHER WORLD HOW THEN CRIED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE OTHER WORLD
OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
ADVANCING HIS HAND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE HE TOOK IT UP AND LOOKED AT IT IN THE MIDST OF THE ACTION HE WENT ASTRAY AND WITH ANOTHER DEEP SIGH FELL TO WORK AT HIS SHOEMAKING BUT NOT FOR LONG RELEASING HIS ARM SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE HE WAS A STRICT MAN OF BUSINESS
AN UNNATURAL SILENCE AND DESERTION REIGNED THERE ONLY ONE SOUL WAS TO BE SEEN AND THAT WAS MADAME DEFARGE WHO LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST KNITTING AND SAW NOTHING
TURNING HER EYES AGAIN UPON LUCIE JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT
COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
LOOKING SILENTLY ON AT THE MORNING TRAFFIC IN FLEET STREET WITH THEIR TWO HEADS AS NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE TWO EYES OF EACH WERE BORE A CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO A PAIR OF MONKEYS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT LESSENED BY THE ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE MATURE JERRY BIT AND SPAT OUT STRAW
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
HE HAD GRADUALLY DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE IN A LETHARGY WORN OUT SHE HAD NESTLED DOWN WITH HIM THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT LIE UPON HER ARM AND HER HAIR DROOPING OVER HIM CURTAINED HIM FROM THE LIGHT
I BRING BACK THE REMEMBRANCE OF A HOME LONG DESOLATE WHILE YOUR POOR HEART PINED AWAY WEEP FOR IT WEEP FOR IT SHE HELD HIM CLOSER ROUND THE NECK AND ROCKED HIM ON HER BREAST LIKE A CHILD
THE REPUBLIC GOES BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE IS SUPREME EVREMONDE WE ARE PRESSED ONE WORD THE DOCTOR ENTREATED WILL YOU TELL ME WHO DENOUNCED HIM IT IS AGAINST RULE ANSWERED THE FIRST BUT YOU CAN ASK HIM OF SAINT ANTOINE HERE
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
MISS PROSS CURTSEYED AT THE NAME AND AS SUCH MY MAXIM IS CONFOUND THEIR POLITICS FRUSTRATE THEIR KNAVISH TRICKS ON HIM OUR HOPES WE FIX GOD SAVE THE KING
THAT HE STOOD WITH THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
BUT THE UNSTEADY FINGERS OF ONE OF HIS HANDS STRAYED TO HIS LIPS AS HE LOOKED AT IT HIS LIPS AND HIS NAILS WERE OF THE SAME PALE LEAD COLOUR AND THEN THE HAND DROPPED TO HIS WORK AND HE ONCE MORE BENT OVER THE SHOE THE LOOK AND THE ACTION HAD OCCUPIED BUT AN INSTANT
GOD BLESS YOU HE PUT HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION MISS MANETTE OF MY EVER RESUMING THIS CONVERSATION BY SO MUCH AS A PASSING WORD I WILL NEVER REFER TO IT AGAIN
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
YES RETURNED MISTER LORRY DRYING HIS EYES YOU ARE RIGHT BUT HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE YES HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE ECHOED CARTON
DON'T SAY THAT MISS MANETTE FOR YOU WOULD HAVE RECLAIMED ME IF ANYTHING COULD YOU WILL NOT BE THE CAUSE OF MY BECOMING WORSE SINCE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND THAT YOU DESCRIBE IS AT ALL EVENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOME INFLUENCE OF MINE
THIS FOULON WAS AT THE HOTEL DE VILLE AND MIGHT BE LOOSED NEVER IF SAINT ANTOINE KNEW HIS OWN SUFFERINGS INSULTS AND WRONGS ARMED MEN AND WOMEN FLOCKED OUT OF THE QUARTER SO FAST AND DREW EVEN THESE LAST DREGS AFTER THEM WITH SUCH A FORCE OF SUCTION
TO KEEP A LIFE YOU LOVE BESIDE YOU HE SAID FAREWELL SAID A LAST GOD BLESS YOU
BOTH MISTER LORRY AND DEFARGE WERE RATHER DISINCLINED TO THIS COURSE AND IN FAVOUR OF ONE OF THEM REMAINING BUT AS THERE WERE NOT ONLY CARRIAGE AND HORSES TO BE SEEN TO BUT TRAVELLING PAPERS AND AS TIME PRESSED FOR THE DAY WAS DRAWING TO AN END
WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT
SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES
CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER THE OTHERS WALKED AWAY JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR HOWEVER TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM
BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF TOLERABLE CALMNESS TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION TO HAVE HER COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED
THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE
IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
AND HENCE MISS MORLAND HAD A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THE COMPANY BENEATH HER AND OF ALL THE DANGERS OF HER LATE PASSAGE THROUGH THEM IT WAS A SPLENDID SIGHT AND SHE BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EVENING
I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD
AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY AND HER ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES FROM THEM HOWEVER THE EIGHT PARTS OF SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE
IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH WHICH IS THE TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH TEARS
HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
AND WHEN THE ASSEMBLY CLOSED PARTED ON THE LADY'S SIDE AT LEAST WITH A STRONG INCLINATION FOR CONTINUING THE ACQUAINTANCE
HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US
I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST
FOR YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN ANYBODY CAN CONCEIVE I AM QUITE UNEASY ABOUT YOUR DEAR BROTHER NOT HAVING HEARD FROM HIM SINCE HE WENT TO OXFORD AND AM FEARFUL OF SOME MISUNDERSTANDING YOUR KIND OFFICES WILL SET ALL RIGHT
AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER VERY TRUE I THINK LIKE YOU THERE IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE SIDE THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER NO MATTER WHICH HAS IT SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE THOUGH NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY ALONG NARROW WINDING VAULTS BY A LOW GRATED DOOR
TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
YOU TOTALLY DISALLOW ANY SIMILARITY IN THE OBLIGATIONS AND MAY I NOT THENCE INFER THAT YOUR NOTIONS OF THE DUTIES OF THE DANCING STATE ARE NOT SO STRICT AS YOUR PARTNER MIGHT WISH HAVE I NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE TO YOU JUST NOW WERE TO RETURN
FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
OUR DESCENDANTS WILL WONDER HOW WE DID IT AND SAY HOW CLEVER WE WERE WE SHALL BE REFERRED TO LOVINGLY AS THOSE GRAND OLD ARTISTS THAT FLOURISHED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND PRODUCED THOSE CHINA DOGS THE
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
THEIR TAKING IT IN THE WAY THEY DID IRRITATED ME THERE IS NOTHING DOES IRRITATE ME MORE THAN SEEING OTHER PEOPLE SITTING ABOUT DOING NOTHING WHEN I'M WORKING I LIVED WITH A MAN ONCE WHO USED TO MAKE ME MAD THAT WAY
HARRIS HOWEVER SAID HE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR A BIT AND PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD TAKE A TURN SO AS WE WERE IN I GOT OUT AND TOOK THE TOW LINE AND RAN THE BOAT ON PAST HAMPTON COURT WHAT A DEAR OLD WALL THAT IS THAT RUNS ALONG BY THE RIVER THERE
I SAID I DIDN'T CARE A HANG WHETHER THE SOAP WAS IN OR WHETHER IT WASN'T AND I SLAMMED THE BAG TO AND STRAPPED IT AND FOUND THAT I HAD PACKED MY TOBACCO POUCH IN IT AND HAD TO RE OPEN IT
FROM CREWE I HAD THE COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF THOUGH THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AS WE DREW UP AT THE DIFFERENT STATIONS THE PEOPLE SEEING MY EMPTY CARRIAGE WOULD RUSH FOR IT
WAS ENGLAND'S VIRGIN QUEEN THERE'S SCARCELY A PUB OF ANY ATTRACTIONS WITHIN TEN MILES OF LONDON THAT SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE LOOKED IN AT OR STOPPED AT OR SLEPT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER I WONDER NOW
UNNATURAL NOTIONS ABOUT
WHICH YOU MIXED WITH WATER AND CALLED LEMONADE PLENTY OF TEA AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN CASE AS GEORGE SAID WE GOT UPSET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GEORGE HARPED TOO MUCH ON THE GETTING UPSET IDEA
OH NO NOT NOW SIR IT DID USED TO KNOCK ME OVER A BIT AT FIRST BUT LOR LOVE YOU ME AND THE MISSUS WE LISTENS TO EM ALL DAY NOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
HE SAID HE DEARLY LOVED A BIT OF CHEESE BUT IT WAS BEYOND HIS MEANS
AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK LATELY OF ITS BEING MADE USE OF BY THE ANGLING FRATERNITY IN GENERAL INDEED THE COMMITTEE OF THE THAMES ANGLER'S ASSOCIATION DID RECOMMEND ITS ADOPTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OPPOSED IT
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
AND FELT THAT THE THING WOULD SOON BECOME EXCITING IT DID THEY STARTED WITH BREAKING A CUP THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THEY DID
I READ THE PRESCRIPTION IT RAN
AND THEN THERE REMAINED THE HAMPERS TO DO HARRIS SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE WANTING TO START IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS TIME AND THOUGHT THAT HE AND GEORGE HAD BETTER DO THE REST AND I AGREED AND SAT DOWN AND THEY HAD A GO
SO HE SLIPPED FROM THE NOISY REVEL TO STEAL A QUIET MOONLIGHT HOUR WITH HIS BELOVED
BUT THE UNANIMOUS OPINION WAS THAT IT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN BROUGHT ON BY OVERWORK WHAT WE WANT IS REST SAID HARRIS REST AND A COMPLETE CHANGE SAID GEORGE
WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN DINNER PLATES BE RANGED ABOVE THE CHIMNEYPIECES OF THE GREAT IN THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND AND ODD
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
AND HAVE THINGS THROWN AT HIS HEAD THEN HE FEELS HIS DAY HAS NOT BEEN WASTED TO GET SOMEBODY TO STUMBLE OVER HIM AND CURSE HIM STEADILY FOR AN HOUR IS HIS HIGHEST AIM AND OBJECT AND WHEN HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
AND UP THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE
THEN I WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT I HAVE CAUGHT FIFTY AND SO ON BUT I WILL NOT LIE ANY MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT IS SINFUL TO LIE BUT THE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT PLAN DID NOT WORK WELL AT ALL HE NEVER WAS ABLE TO USE IT
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
AND THEN HE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH IT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HE ONLY DOUBLED AND HE THEREFORE GAINED NO CREDIT THAT WAY WHATEVER WHILE HIS MODERATION PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AMONG THE OTHER ANGLERS
IT IS LIKE THE SUNSET AND THE STARS WE ARE NOT AWED BY THEIR LOVELINESS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMON TO OUR EYES SO IT IS WITH THAT CHINA DOG IN TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT PEOPLE WILL GUSH OVER IT
FANCY JIM BATES AND JOE MUGGLES AND MISTER JONES AND OLD BILLY MAUNDERS ALL TELLING YOU THAT THEY HAD CAUGHT IT HA HA HA WELL THAT IS GOOD SAID THE HONEST OLD FELLOW LAUGHING HEARTILY
WILL THE WHITE CUPS WITH THE GOLD RIM AND THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD FLOWER INSIDE SPECIES UNKNOWN THAT OUR SARAH JANES NOW BREAK IN SHEER LIGHT HEARTEDNESS OF SPIRIT BE CAREFULLY MENDED
AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT
I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME DEAR BOY WITH TELLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME LIFE IS BRIEF AND YOU MIGHT PASS AWAY BEFORE I HAD FINISHED BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT THE MATTER WITH ME I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE
THAT WE PRIZE SO NOW OR IF IT IS ONLY THE HALO OF AGE GLOWING AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR CHARMS IN OUR EYES THE OLD BLUE THAT WE HANG ABOUT OUR WALLS AS ORNAMENTS
THE PROPRIETOR WENT UP TO THE PAPER AND TAPPED IT IT GAVE FORTH A WOODEN SOUND OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE
AND A LOVELY NIGHT AFTER IT THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD READ THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WARM FINE TO SET FAIR DAY MUCH HEAT AND WE WOULD DRESS OURSELVES IN FLIMSY THINGS
AND GEORGE SAID THE CROPS SEEMED TO BE COMING UP NICELY AFTER THAT IT CAME OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THAT WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
SPEAKING OF OAK STAIRCASES REMINDS ME THAT THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT CARVED OAK STAIRCASE IN ONE OF THE HOUSES IN KINGSTON IT IS A SHOP NOW IN THE MARKET PLACE BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONCE THE MANSION OF SOME GREAT PERSONAGE
I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF
I COULD NOT FIND IT I RUMMAGED THE THINGS UP INTO MUCH THE SAME STATE THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE WORLD WAS CREATED AND WHEN CHAOS REIGNED OF COURSE I FOUND GEORGE'S AND HARRIS'S EIGHTEEN TIMES OVER BUT I COULDN'T FIND MY OWN
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE I AM SURE BUT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN ASLEEP IN BED WHEN I AM UP MADDENS ME IT SEEMS TO ME SO SHOCKING TO SEE THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A MAN'S LIFE THE PRICELESS MOMENTS THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HIM AGAIN
WHY ALL OUR ART TREASURES OF TO DAY ARE ONLY THE DUG UP COMMONPLACES OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
IT SURPRISES ME MYSELF SOMETIMES HOW MANY OF THESE SUBJECTS THERE ARE I IMPRESSED THE FACT UPON GEORGE AND HARRIS AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD BETTER LEAVE THE WHOLE MATTER ENTIRELY TO ME THEY FELL INTO THE SUGGESTION WITH A READINESS
IN WHICH WERE DETAILED THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS BY WHICH A MAN COULD TELL WHEN HIS LIVER WAS OUT OF ORDER
HE WOULD GET ME TO TAKE THEM BACK WITH ME TO LONDON AS HE SHOULD NOT BE COMING UP FOR A DAY OR TWO HIMSELF AND HE DID NOT THINK THE CHEESES OUGHT TO BE KEPT MUCH LONGER OH WITH PLEASURE DEAR BOY I REPLIED WITH PLEASURE
AND EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR THAT MADE HARRIS MAD
HE DID HIS BEST FOR THE MAN THAT PROPHESIES US BAD WEATHER ON THE CONTRARY WE ENTERTAIN ONLY BITTER AND REVENGEFUL THOUGHTS GOING TO CLEAR UP D'YE THINK WE SHOUT CHEERILY AS WE PASS
THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN
AIN'T YOU GOING TO PUT THE BOOTS IN SAID HARRIS AND I LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND I HAD FORGOTTEN THEM THAT'S JUST LIKE HARRIS HE COULDN'T HAVE SAID A WORD UNTIL I'D GOT THE BAG SHUT AND STRAPPED OF COURSE AND GEORGE LAUGHED ONE OF THOSE IRRITATING SENSELESS
AND WILLIAM HARRIS TOLD US HOW HE FELT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AND GEORGE STOOD ON THE HEARTH RUG AND GAVE US A CLEVER AND POWERFUL PIECE OF ACTING ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW HE FELT IN THE NIGHT GEORGE FANCIES HE IS ILL
I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM MISSUS TODD'S USUAL LARGENESS OF MIND THAT I HAD A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS BUT THE CLOUD PASSED QUICKLY OVER HER SPIRIT AND WAS GONE WITH THE OFFENDER
THESE BICYCLES OFFEND ME DREADFULLY THEY DON'T AFFORD NO REAL OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCE SUCH AS A MAN GAINED ON A VOYAGE NO WHEN FOLKS LEFT HOME IN THE OLD DAYS THEY LEFT IT TO SOME PURPOSE
YOUR BABY'S IN A FIT THEY USED TO TELL THAT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION WAS UP ON ITS FEET IN A MINUTE AND RIGHT OUT INTO THE AISLES ALL THE MIS BOWDENS WAS SETTING RIGHT OUT FOR HOME
I'VE GOT NEW DOUGHNUTS DEAR SAID THE LITTLE OLD LADY
SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
THE OLD BOWDEN HOUSE STOOD LOW STORIED AND BROAD ROOFED IN ITS GREEN FIELDS AS IF IT WERE A MOTHERLY BROWN HEN WAITING FOR THE FLOCK THAT CAME STRAYING TOWARD IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION THE FIRST BOWDEN SETTLER
SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
AND THE SHEEP BELL TINKLED AWAY IN HASTE AS IF SOMEONE HAD SHAKEN A STICK IN ITS WEARER'S FACE THEN I LOOKED AND SAW CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE PASSING THE NEAREST WINDOW THE NEXT MOMENT HE TAPPED POLITELY AT THE DOOR COME IN SIR
ONE CORNER WAS ALREADY DUG AND I CHOSE A FAT LOOKING HILL WHERE THE TOPS WERE WELL WITHERED THERE IS ALL THE PLEASURE THAT ONE CAN HAVE IN GOLD DIGGING IN FINDING ONE'S HOPES SATISFIED IN THE RICHES OF A GOOD HILL OF POTATOES
WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MOMENT THAT WHEN I HEARD MISSUS TODD LAUGHING BEHIND US IN THE KITCHEN I LAUGHED TOO BUT WILLIAM DID NOT EVEN BLUSH I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE DEAF AND HE STEPPED ALONG
SMALL COMPANIES WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UP THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FROM THE WATER AND NEARLY ALL THE BOATS HAD COME TO SHORE
THE BOWDEN REUNION IT IS VERY RARE IN COUNTRY LIFE
SHE ADDED WISTFULLY WE ALWAYS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHY IF IT IS A GOOD PLEASANT DAY TOMORROW
WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY STAYED THERE AND HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT IN SEARCH OF ME THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HIS APPEARANCE IT WAS A FACE THIN AND DELICATE WITH REFINEMENT BUT WORN INTO APPEALING LINES
BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
I SAID RISING TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED BOWING WITH MUCH COURTESY I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE DESK AND OFFERED HIM A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT ONCE BEING SADLY SPENT BY HIS CLIMB
AS IF FROM THE INEXHAUSTIBLE BURNING HEART OF THE EARTH THE PRIMAL FIRES BREAK THROUGH THE GRANITE DUST IN WHICH OUR SOULS ARE SET EACH HEART IS WARM AND EVERY FACE SHINES WITH THE ANCIENT LIGHT
WE'RE ALL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND GOING BACK YEAR BY YEAR OH NO CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I HOPE NOT SAID I TRYING TO SOOTHE HIS FEELINGS THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE
IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
LAND SAKES ALIVE
AT LAST TO TURN OUT OF THE STONY HIGHROAD INTO A GREEN LANE SHADED WITH OLD APPLE TREES MISSUS TODD ENCOURAGED THE HORSE UNTIL HE FAIRLY PRANCED WITH GAYETY AS WE DROVE ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE ON THE SOFT TURF
GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
AFTER A SEASON OF REFLECTION WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE FEAST TO BEGIN
AND THERE WON'T BE A THING SHE'LL EVER REGRET EXCEPT TO MOURN BECAUSE WILLIAM WA'N'T HERE MISSUS BLACKETT HAVING BEEN PROPERLY ESCORTED TO THE HOUSE MISSUS TODD RECEIVED HER OWN FULL SHARE OF HONOR AND SOME OF THE MEN
THE SKY THE SEA HAVE WATCHED POOR HUMANITY AT ITS RITES SO LONG WE WERE NO MORE A NEW ENGLAND FAMILY CELEBRATING ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND SIMPLE PROGRESS
ANSWERED MISSUS TODD HE'S A GOOD SIGHT BETTER COMPANY THOUGH DREAMY THAN SUCH SORDID CREATUR'S AS MARI HARRIS LIVE AND LET LIVE SAID DEAR OLD MISSUS BLACKETT GENTLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE
NEVER'D LOOK SO DISCONSOLATE IF SHE WAS ANY SORT OF A PROPER PERSON TO DIRECT THINGS SHE MIGHT DIVERT HIM YES SHE MIGHT DIVERT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AN LET HIM THINK HE HAD HIS OWN WAY STEAD O ARGUING EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE BARE BONE
IN MONGST THE CLIMBIN' BEANS SHE SMILED
I RETURNED TO MY FIXED SEAT BEHIND THE TEACHER'S DESK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOWER PLACE OF A SCHOLAR YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE PLACE OF HONOR CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I SAID A HAPPY RURAL SEAT OF VARIOUS VIEWS
WHICH THE BOYS AND GIRLS MADE WE BROUGHT FLOWERS FROM THE FENCE THICKETS OF THE GREAT FIELD AND OUT OF THE DISORDER OF FLOWERS AND PROVISIONS SUDDENLY APPEARED AS ORDERLY A SCHEME FOR THE FEAST AS THE MARSHAL HAD SHAPED FOR THE PROCESSION
WHO PRESENTLY HAD HER COURT INSIDE THE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS TODD LARGE HOSPITABLE AND PREEMINENT WAS THE CENTRE OF A RAPIDLY INCREASING CROWD ABOUT THE LILAC BUSHES
STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
BUT WITH A GRAND MILITARY SORT OF COURTESY AND BORE HIMSELF WITH SOLEMN DIGNITY OF IMPORTANCE WE WERE SORTED OUT ACCORDING TO SOME CLEAR DESIGN OF HIS OWN AND STOOD AS SPEECHLESS AS A TROOP TO AWAIT HIS ORDERS
WITH A SIMPLE KINDNESS THAT WAS THE SOUL OF CHIVALRY WAITED UPON US AND OUR BASKETS AND LED AWAY THE WHITE HORSE I ALREADY KNEW SOME OF MISSUS TODD'S FRIENDS AND KINDRED AND FELT LIKE AN ADOPTED BOWDEN IN THIS HAPPY MOMENT
AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
MISSUS SIMPSON WAS SELDOM AT HOME AND EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAD LITTLE CONCERN AS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PREMISES A FAVORITE DIVERSION WAS TO MAKE THE HOUSE INTO A FORT
AT THE MAN'S NOD OF ASSENT REBECCA SPED DOWN THE LANE
THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE A BROWN SASH LIKE THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHERE COULD I BE GREEN DO THEY HAVE GREEN PETTICOATS I WONDER I'D LIKE A GREEN PETTICOAT COMING OUT NOW AND THEN UNDERNEATH
I'D RATHER BE AN APPLE TREE IN BLOSSOM THAT ONE THAT BLOOMS PINK BY OUR PIG PEN REBECCA LAUGHED THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IN EMMA JANE'S REPLIES
SHE WOULD BE NOBLE AND GENEROUS SHE WOULD GIVE UP A GRAND SCHOOL IN BOSTON BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO COME HERE WHERE HER FATHER LIVED WHEN HE WAS A BOY
CLARA BELLE SUSAN AND THE TWINS WERE RUNNING ALONG THE PATH AND MINNIE WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN SHRIEKING WHAT MADE THE SLEIGH LOVE SIMPSON SO THE EAGER CHILDREN CRIED WHY SIMPSON LOVED THE SLEIGH YOU KNOW THE TEACHER QUICK REPLIED
A SENSE OF FORM POETS WOULD CALL IT WHEN YOU GROW OLDER
BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF
BUT WENT TO BED TO DREAM OF HER INSTEAD IN HIS DREAMS FLASHES OF LIGHTNING PROCEEDED FROM BOTH HER EYES AND SHE HELD A FLAMING SWORD IN EITHER HAND REBECCA ENTERED THE HOME DINING ROOM JOYOUSLY THE BURNHAM SISTERS HAD GONE AND THE TWO AUNTS WERE KNITTING
WHEN THE CHILDREN ASKED MISSUS PERKINS IF THEY COULD CALL AT JUST A FEW HOUSES COMING AND GOING AND SELL A LITTLE SOAP FOR THE SIMPSONS SHE AT FIRST REPLIED DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE
EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLARA BELLE AND I SHOULD NEVER CALL HER REMARKABLE ANSWERED MISS MIRANDA HAS ADAM BEEN HOME AGAIN YES HE'S BEEN STAYING A FEW DAYS WITH HIS AUNT THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE MONEY HE'S MAKING THEY SAY AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS PRESENTS FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS
THREE MILES FROM RIVERBORO WOULD SERVE EVERY PURPOSE FOR THEIR DAUGHTER AND SEND HER INTO THE WORLD WITH AS FINE AN INTELLECTUAL POLISH AS SHE COULD WELL SUSTAIN
MY MOTHER TELLS ME NEVER TO SAY HARD THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE'S OWN FOLKS TO THEIR FACE SHE SAYS NOBODY CAN BEAR IT AND IT'S WICKED TO SHAME THEM FOR WHAT ISN'T THEIR FAULT
HERE IN SOAP BOXES HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES WERE STORED ALL THEIR TREASURES WEE BASKETS AND PLATES AND CUPS MADE OF BURDOCK BALLS BITS OF BROKEN CHINA FOR PARTIES
IF MY DEPARTMENT WERE GEOGRAPHY OR MATHEMATICS I BELIEVE I SHOULD FEEL THAT I WAS ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING FOR IN THOSE BRANCHES APPLICATION AND INDUSTRY WORK WONDERS BUT IN ENGLISH LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
MY MOTHER AND ALL YOUR RELATIONS AND THE PRESIDENT SAID REBECCA GAINING COURAGE AS THE NOBLE WORDS FELL FROM HER LIPS I DON'T CARE IF YOU TELL THE TOWN THE WHOLE OF YORK COUNTY THE STATE OF MAINE
OR DIRT TRAPS SET IN HER GARDEN PATHS THE SIMPSON TWINS STOOD IN SUCH AWE OF HER THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO COME TO THE SIDE DOOR EVEN WHEN MISS JANE HELD GINGERBREAD COOKIES IN HER OUTSTRETCHED HANDS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT REBECCA IRRITATED HER AUNT WITH EVERY BREATH SHE DREW
BY DINT OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND PUTTING SUCH A SEAL UPON THEIR LIPS AS NEVER MORTALS PUT BEFORE THE TWO GIRLS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THEIR WONDERFUL NEWS TO THEMSELVES
COUSIN CYRUS IS AN OLD MAN AN CONSID'ABLE TROUBLE BUT HE THINKS MY TEETH ARE HANDSOME AN SAYS I'VE GOT A SPLENDID SUIT OF HAIR THERE AIN'T A PERSON IN LEWISTON THAT KNOWS ABOUT THE MINISTER OR FATHER'S WILL
TO BRING HER SOME COMPOSITION WRITTEN DURING THE YEAR BEFORE THAT SHE MIGHT JUDGE THE WORK AND KNOW PRECISELY WITH WHAT MATERIAL SHE HAD TO DEAL
OH DON'T MENTION IT LAUGHED MISTER ALADDIN LIFTING HIS HAT I WAS A SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MYSELF ONCE YEARS AGO AND I LIKE TO SEE THE THING WELL DONE GOOD BY MISS REBECCA ROWENA
I HAVEN'T ANY COMPOSITIONS HERE MISS MAXWELL
A LETTER FROM REBECCA RANDALL TO HER SISTER HANNAH AT SUNNYBROOK FARM OR TO HER AUNT JANE AT THE BRICK HOUSE RIVERBORO IS SO DULL AND STUPID IF IT IS A REAL LETTER
HOW HE MAKES US UNDERSTAND AND THE PEARL NEVER HEARD OF HIM UNTIL NOW THINK OF READING LUCY TO A CLASS AND WHEN YOU FINISH SEEING A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAIR OF LIPS QUIVERING WITH DELIGHT AND A PAIR OF EYES BRIMMING WITH COMPREHENDING TEARS YOU POOR DARLING
BUT A DOGGED UNSWERVING LOYALTY AND THE GIFT OF DEVOTED UNSELFISH LOVING THESE AFTER ALL ARE TALENTS OF A SORT AND MAY POSSIBLY BE OF AS MUCH VALUE IN THE WORLD AS A SENSE OF NUMBERS OR A FACULTY FOR LANGUAGES
HER IDEA OF PLEASURE WAS AN EVER CHANGING CIRCLE OF ADMIRERS TO FETCH AND CARRY FOR HER THE MORE PUBLICLY THE BETTER
OH DO YOU THINK AUNT MIRANDY'LL EVER LET ME GO TO MILLTOWN WITH MISTER COBB HE'S ASKED ME AGAIN YOU KNOW
AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
WAS RETURNING HOME BY WAY OF THE SHORT CUT
ABNER HIMSELF AVOWED HIS COMPLETE INNOCENCE AND TOLD THE NEIGHBORS HOW A RED HAIRED MAN WITH A HARE LIP AND A PEPPER AND SALT SUIT OF CLOTHES HAD CALLED HIM UP ONE MORNING ABOUT DAYLIGHT AND OFFERED TO SWAP HIM A GOOD SLEIGH FOR AN OLD CIDER PRESS HE HAD LAYIN OUT IN THE DOORYARD
HANNAH TOOK AFTER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS ALL SAWYER POOR HANNAH THAT WAS TRUE HANNAH SPOKE ONLY WHEN SPOKEN TO INSTEAD OF FIRST LAST AND ALL THE TIME HANNAH AT FOURTEEN WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH HANNAH LIKED TO KNIT
SHE WAS WILLING TO GO ON ERRANDS BUT OFTEN FORGOT WHAT SHE WAS SENT FOR SHE LEFT THE SCREEN DOORS AJAR SO THAT FLIES CAME IN HER TONGUE WAS EVER IN MOTION SHE SANG OR WHISTLED WHEN SHE WAS PICKING UP CHIPS
THE FALL OF ONE SMALL STONE CAST BY THE VALIANT ELIJAH KNOWN AS THE FIGHTING TWIN DID BREAK THE STILLNESS OF THE WOODS FOR A MOMENT BUT IT DID NOT COME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF MINNIE WHO SHOUTED JAIL BIRDS
COULD NEVER DO WITH THE UNSATISFACTORY ORGANS OF VISION GIVEN THEM BY MOTHER NATURE MISS MAXWELL'S GLANCE WAS ALWAYS MEETING A PAIR OF EAGER DARK EYES WHEN SHE SAID ANYTHING PARTICULARLY GOOD SHE LOOKED FOR APPROVAL TO THE CORNER OF THE SECOND BENCH
FOR THIS ONE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CROSS EYED I REMEMBER MISSUS LADD SAYING ADAM REMARKED ABOUT THIS CHILD'S HANDSOME EYES HE SAID IT WAS HER EYES THAT MADE HIM BUY THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES MISSUS LADD HAS IT STACKED UP IN THE SHED CHAMBER
AND MISTER PERKINS WOULD HAVE TO HIRE A BOY TO DRIVE EMMA JANE AND FINALLY THAT WHEN A GIRL HAD SUCH A PASSION FOR LEARNING AS EMMA JANE IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE WICKEDNESS TO CROSS HER WILL
BECAUSE ON THOSE DAYS SHE FORSOOK THE CHEERFUL SOCIETY OF HER MATES AND SOUGHT A SAFE SOLITUDE IN THE WOODS RETURNING AFTER A TIME WITH A JOCUND SMILE ON HER SMUG FACE AFTER ONE OF THESE PRIVATE LUNCHEONS REBECCA HAD BEEN TEMPTED BEYOND HER STRENGTH
NEITHER DID HER COURAGE FLAG
JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
HE NEEDED THE SOAP DREADFULLY AS A PRESENT FOR HIS AUNT MISS JANE STILL LOOKED A LITTLE UNCONVINCED THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID I HOPE YOUR AUNT MIRANDA WON'T MIND BUT YOU KNOW HOW PARTICULAR SHE IS REBECCA AND I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITHOUT ASKING HER FIRST FOR YOUR ACTIONS ARE VERY QUEER
TO BRIGHTEN MY DECLINING YEARS THERE FINALLY WAS A PINK GINGHAM AND WHEN IT WAS NICELY FINISHED AUNT JANE GAVE REBECCA A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE SHE SHOWED HER HOW TO MAKE A PRETTY TRIMMING OF NARROW WHITE LINEN TAPE
SHE TRIED TO LIKE HER AUNT MIRANDA
SAID TO HIM IN A ROUGH VOICE MARCH AND GO QUICKLY
AT THIS WARM GREETING THE POOR TUNNY WHO WAS NOT USED TO SUCH TENDERNESS WEPT LIKE A CHILD HE FELT SO EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED THAT HE TURNED QUICKLY PLUNGED INTO THE SEA AND DISAPPEARED IN THE MEANTIME DAY HAD DAWNED
AS HE LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OPEN JAWS OF HIS NEW HOME THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO ESCAPE HE WHISPERED TURNING TO HIS FATHER THE SHARK IS FAST ASLEEP THE SEA IS CALM AND THE NIGHT IS AS BRIGHT AS DAY FOLLOW ME CLOSELY DEAR FATHER AND WE SHALL SOON BE SAVED
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
WE'LL COME TO PLEASE YOU NOW IT MUST BE KNOWN THAT AMONG ALL HIS FRIENDS PINOCCHIO HAD ONE WHOM HE LOVED MOST OF ALL
THE REST OF THE NIGHT HE HAD TO SPEND WITH ONE FOOT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE OTHER ONE IN THE AIR AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE DOOR FINALLY OPENED THAT BRAVE LITTLE ANIMAL THE SNAIL
AND SO I WENT BACK TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE SHE WAS DEAD AND THE PIGEON SEEING ME CRYING SAID TO ME
AND TEACHERS AS WE ALL DO THEY ARE YOUR WORST ENEMIES YOU KNOW AND THEY LIKE TO MAKE YOU AS UNHAPPY AS THEY CAN AND IF I GO ON STUDYING WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ME YOU'LL PAY FOR IT REALLY YOU AMUSE ME ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE NODDING HIS HEAD
I AM GOING TO THE MARKET PLACE TO BUY MYSELF A COAT A CAP AND A PAIR OF SHOES WHEN I COME BACK I'LL BE SO DRESSED UP YOU WILL THINK I AM A RICH MAN HE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP THE ROAD TO THE VILLAGE LAUGHING AND SINGING SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED
THE SQUARES WERE FILLED WITH SMALL WOODEN THEATERS OVERFLOWING WITH BOYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND ON THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
PINOCCHIO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE FIRMLY RESOLVED TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF THERE HE LOST COURAGE AND RAN BACK A FEW STEPS A SECOND TIME HE CAME TO THE DOOR AND AGAIN HE RAN BACK A THIRD TIME HE REPEATED HIS PERFORMANCE
EXACTLY AND YOU I AM THE TUNNY YOUR COMPANION IN THE SHARK'S STOMACH AND HOW DID YOU ESCAPE I IMITATED YOUR EXAMPLE
THERE IN FRONT OF HIM IN A BOX SAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AROUND HER NECK SHE WORE A LONG GOLD CHAIN FROM WHICH HUNG A LARGE MEDALLION ON THE MEDALLION WAS PAINTED THE PICTURE OF A MARIONETTE
CRIED PINOCCHIO AS HE RAN AND JUMPED ON HIS FATHER'S NECK THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN OUR HOUSE IS ALL YOUR DOING MY DEAR PINOCCHIO ANSWERED GEPPETTO WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH IT JUST THIS WHEN BAD BOYS BECOME GOOD AND KIND
AND KEEP IT FOR YOUR SUPPER CALLED OUT THE BOLDEST OF HIS TORMENTORS AND WITH THE WORDS HE GAVE PINOCCHIO A TERRIBLE BLOW ON THE HEAD PINOCCHIO ANSWERED WITH ANOTHER BLOW AND THAT WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE FRAY IN
AT THAT MOMENT A LOUD KNOCKING WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND A VOICE CALLED TO THEM
IN THE LAND OF TOYS NOT EVEN THE SHADOW OF ONE NOT EVEN ONE TEACHER NOT ONE AND ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY
I OH NO
WHERE CAN YOU FIND A PLACE THAT WILL AGREE BETTER WITH YOU AND ME NO SCHOOLS NO TEACHERS NO BOOKS
OVER A DONKEY THAT CAN WEEP MOUNT QUICKLY AND LET US GO THE NIGHT IS COOL AND THE ROAD IS LONG PINOCCHIO OBEYED WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THE WAGON STARTED AGAIN
POOR BEAST COME COME SAID THE LITTLE MAN
GO TO BED AND SLEEP YOU WILL FEEL BETTER IN THE MORNING IN THE MEANTIME THE BOYS HAVING USED ALL THEIR BOOKS LOOKED AROUND FOR NEW AMMUNITION
WERE WORDS LIKE THESE HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC NO MORE SCHOOL AS SOON AS THEY HAD SET FOOT IN THAT LAND PINOCCHIO
HE FOUND OUT I WAS INNOCENT WHEN I CAUGHT THE WEASELS AND HE LET ME GO
THE SEATS ARE ALL FILLED ANSWERED THE LITTLE MAN BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I THINK OF YOU TAKE MY PLACE AS COACHMAN AND YOU
SAID LAMP WICK ARE YOU GOING ALONE OR WITH OTHERS ALONE THERE WILL BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF US WILL YOU WALK AT MIDNIGHT THE WAGON PASSES HERE THAT IS TO TAKE US
SANG SLEEPILY BETWEEN HIS TEETH AFTER A MILE OR SO PINOCCHIO AGAIN HEARD THE SAME FAINT VOICE WHISPERING REMEMBER LITTLE SIMPLETON
BUT THEY ALL ANSWERED AREN'T YOU ASHAMED INSTEAD OF BEING A BEGGAR IN THE STREETS WHY DON'T YOU LOOK FOR WORK AND EARN YOUR OWN BREAD
BUT I HAVE FOUND IN HIM ONE GREAT REDEEMING FEATURE DO YOU SEE THIS LITTLE BUMP ON HIS FOREHEAD IT IS THIS BUMP WHICH GIVES HIM HIS GREAT TALENT OF DANCING AND USING HIS FEET AS NIMBLY AS A HUMAN BEING
IS COMPOSED OF SIX SATURDAYS AND ONE SUNDAY VERY SURE AND THAT
HE TURNED TO THE DOLPHIN AND SAID FAREWELL MISTER FISH
THINK HOW GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
OH HO WHERE IS THE OWNER OF THE HUT CRIED PINOCCHIO VERY MUCH SURPRISED HERE I AM UP HERE FATHER AND SON LOOKED UP TO THE CEILING AND THERE ON A BEAM SAT THE TALKING CRICKET OH MY DEAR CRICKET
OR AWAKE AND DECIDED HE MUST BE AWAKE AND WHERE IS FATHER HE CRIED SUDDENLY HE RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND THERE STOOD GEPPETTO GROWN YEARS YOUNGER OVERNIGHT SPICK AND SPAN IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND GAY AS A LARK IN THE MORNING
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX PINOCCHIO FINALLY CEASES TO BE A MARIONETTE AND BECOMES A BOY MY DEAR FATHER WE ARE SAVED CRIED THE MARIONETTE
REMEMBER THAT BOYS WHO INSIST ON HAVING THEIR OWN WAY SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF THE SAME NONSENSE GOOD BY CRICKET GOOD NIGHT PINOCCHIO AND MAY HEAVEN PRESERVE YOU FROM THE ASSASSINS THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
REMEMBER THE OLD PROVERB WHOEVER STEALS HIS NEIGHBOR'S SHIRT USUALLY DIES WITHOUT HIS OWN
FROM AN EARACHE NEVER AND YOU NEVER STILL SINCE THIS MORNING MY EAR HAS BEEN TORTURING ME
POOR CRAB HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SPOKEN TO THE WIND INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO HIS GOOD ADVICE PINOCCHIO TURNED TO HIM AND SAID AS ROUGHLY AS HE KNEW HOW KEEP QUIET UGLY GAB IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO CHEW A FEW COUGH DROPS TO GET RID OF THAT COLD YOU HAVE
TO MY OWN GOOD LUCK THAT SHIP WAS LOADED WITH MEAT PRESERVED FOODS CRACKERS BREAD BOTTLES OF WINE RAISINS CHEESE COFFEE SUGAR WAX CANDLES AND BOXES OF MATCHES
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO HIT YOU YOU KNOW BELIEVE ME I DIDN'T DO IT OPEN YOUR EYES EUGENE IF YOU KEEP THEM SHUT I'LL DIE TOO OH DEAR ME HOW SHALL I EVER GO HOME NOW
IN A MOCKING WAY FINALLY
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
THE GRAPES WERE NO OTHER THAN GOLD COINS WHICH TINKLED MERRILY AS THEY SWAYED IN THE WIND THEY SEEMED TO SAY
THERE HE FOUND A NEW SUIT A NEW HAT AND A PAIR OF SHOES AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEATHER PURSE ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR RETURNS
MY DONKEY HAS DRAWN THE WATER FOR ME BUT NOW THAT POOR ANIMAL IS DYING WILL YOU TAKE ME TO SEE HIM SAID PINOCCHIO GLADLY AS SOON AS PINOCCHIO WENT INTO THE STABLE HE SPIED A LITTLE DONKEY LYING ON A BED OF STRAW IN THE CORNER OF THE STABLE
BUT PINOCCHIO DID NOT LIKE THAT ANY BETTER AH YOU DON'T LIKE HAY EITHER HE CRIED ANGRILY WAIT MY PRETTY DONKEY I'LL TEACH YOU NOT TO BE SO PARTICULAR WITHOUT MORE ADO HE TOOK A WHIP
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BAG PINOCCHIO FELT SLIGHTLY HAPPIER AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY FRIEND MUST BE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME SICKNESS THAT I AM
BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
TAKE THE FUNNY LOOKING THING ALONG DO WELL PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MURMURED THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE A NICE NEW KIND OF PET BUT DOES THE ER
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES FOR THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS HE TOO WANTED TO LIVE WITH THE DOCTOR HE ASKED COULDN'T HE SLEEP IN THE FISH POND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN IF HE PROMISED NOT TO EAT THE FISH
SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
THE OLD LADIES GREW AFRAID TO SEND THEIR LAP DOGS TO DOCTOR DOLITTLE BECAUSE OF THE CROCODILE AND THE FARMERS WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EAT THE LAMBS AND SICK CALVES THEY BROUGHT TO BE CURED
AND ONE EVENING WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE THEY BEGAN TALKING IT OVER AMONG THEMSELVES IN WHISPERS AND THE OWL TOO TOO WHO WAS GOOD AT ARITHMETIC
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE GOING ON ALONE POLYNESIA SAID WE MUST TREAD SOFTLY AND TALK LOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE LAND OF THE JOLLIGINKI
AND SOON NOW THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN AND HIS SISTER SARAH BOUGHT A NEW DRESS AND WAS HAPPY SOME OF THE ANIMALS WHO CAME TO SEE HIM WERE SO SICK THAT THEY HAD TO STAY AT THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE FOR A WEEK
TRYING TO SNIFF THE COOKING SMELLS THAT CAME FROM THE PALACE KITCHEN SHE TOLD THE PIG TO BRING THE DOCTOR TO THE WINDOW BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM SO GUB GUB WENT AND WOKE THE DOCTOR
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
BUT HE WEPT SUCH BIG TEARS AND BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY THAT THE DOCTOR HADN'T THE HEART TO TURN HIM OUT SO THEN THE DOCTOR'S SISTER CAME TO HIM AND SAID
BY THE EDGE OF THE RIVER THEY STOPPED AND SAID FAREWELL THIS TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF MONKEYS WANTED TO SHAKE JOHN DOLITTLE BY THE HAND
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
AND FLEW OFF PULLING THE BOAT ALONG AND ALTHOUGH SWALLOWS ARE NOT VERY STRONG WHEN ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE BY THEMSELVES IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THERE ARE A GREAT LOT OF THEM TOGETHER
CATCHING HIM AND BRINGING HIM BACK THAT I TURNED TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SWAMP SH LOOK THERE'S PRINCE BUMPO COMING INTO THE GARDEN HE MUST NOT SEE US
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
IN ALL WEATHERS FOR PUSHMI PULLYUS NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD EVER BEEN CAUGHT EVEN THEN YEARS AGO HE WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WITH TWO HEADS WELL
THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
WHEN THE CIRCUS MEN CAME TO TAKE HIM BACK HE GOT SO WILD AND SAVAGE THAT HE FRIGHTENED THEM AWAY BUT TO EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS ALWAYS AS GENTLE AS A KITTEN BUT NOW
GETTING THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH MUD THEY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE KING'S BACK GARDEN BY MISTAKE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUNNING UP AT ONCE AND CAUGHT THEM
NO MATTER WHAT COLOR HE WAS MADE STILL HE HAD A GOOD HEART SAID THE DOCTOR ROMANTIC OF COURSE BUT A GOOD HEART AFTER ALL HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
THIS DOCTOR SAID CHEE CHEE IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE RAREST ANIMAL OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES THE ONLY TWO HEADED BEAST IN THE WORLD TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU
AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
THIS COAST IS THE SEASHORE OF THE GREAT DESERT IT IS A WILD LONELY PLACE ALL SAND AND STONES AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE BARBARY PIRATES LIVED THESE PIRATES A BAD LOT OF MEN
LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
BUT A HEAD AT EACH END AND SHARP HORNS ON EACH HEAD THEY WERE VERY SHY AND TERRIBLY HARD TO CATCH THE BLACK MEN GET MOST OF THEIR ANIMALS BY SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM WHILE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING
BUT POLYNESIA FLEW INTO A TREE IN THE GARDEN WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING HER AND HID HERSELF
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
LIFT ME UP AND LET ME LISTEN AT THE KEY HOLE AND I'LL SOON TELL YOU
IT IS FOR OUR SAKES THAT THE OLD MAN FINDS HIMSELF SO LONELY AND SO POOR SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE WAS TO DO THE COOKING AND MENDING THE DOG WAS TO SWEEP THE FLOORS THE DUCK WAS TO DUST AND MAKE THE BEDS
THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
THE SERVANTS MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE AFTER THE PRINCE BUT AS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHICH ROAD HE HAD TAKEN THEY WENT ALL WAYS EXCEPT THE RIGHT ONE AND INSTEAD OF BRINGING HIM BACK THEY RETURNED THEMSELVES WHEN IT GREW DARK
THEN HE WENT ON TO THE WELL DREW UP THE CORD WHICH WAS HALF ROTTEN AND STRETCHED IT OUT IN THE SUN LASTLY HE WENT ROUND THE CASTLE AND PLUNGED INTO THE ORANGE GROVE THERE HE GATHERED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORANGES HE COULD FIND
FARTHER ON HE WAS SEEKING SOMETHING IN A CHINK IN THE WALL IN THE NEXT PICTURE HE WAS OPENING AN OLD CABINET WITH A GOLDEN KEY AND SO IT WENT ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SCENES AND PRESENTLY THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT ANOTHER FIGURE OCCUPIED THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACE IN EACH SCENE
SET OFF BY A SCARLET COCK'S FEATHER HE WAS DRESSED IN A GREEN JACKET WITH A LEATHER BELT AND RED BREECHES AND ON HIS FEET WERE SANDALS FASTENED BY THONGS PASSED ROUND HIS LEGS IN THE GIPSY FASHION
IT WILL END BY GETTING ME SENT AWAY COME SOME OF YOU AND HIDE YOURSELVES AND IF IT COMES AGAIN CATCH IT AND WRING ITS NECK HE SPITTED A THIRD GOOSE LIT A HUGE FIRE AND SEATED HIMSELF BY IT
BUT ALL THE PRINCESS GUARDS WERE SO FOND OF HIM THAT THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY DARED IN SPITE OF THE KING TO MAKE THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY
AND IN PASSING THROUGH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND TOWNS SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
DO NOT OPEN YOUR ORANGES TILL YOU REACH THE BANK OF A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN OUT OF EACH ORANGE WILL COME A PRINCESS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE FOR YOUR WIFE YOUR CHOICE ONCE MADE BE VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO LEAVE YOUR BRIDE FOR AN INSTANT AND REMEMBER
WITH EYES LIKE BILLIARD BALLS CAME TOWARDS HIM SHOWING HIS TEETH WHICH WERE LIKE THE PRONGS OF A FORK
TO FIND THE OPENING BY WHICH THEIR CHILDREN HAD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT AT LAST THE NIGHT FALLING
AS SHE WAS ALWAYS BEING TEASED ABOUT HER COMPLEXION SHE GOT AS NOISY AND CROSS AS A TITMOUSE SO THEY USED TO CALL HER TITTY TITTY WAS OFTEN SENT BY THE BRICKLAYER TO FETCH WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND AS SHE WAS VERY PROUD AND LAZY
AND THE LADIES AT ONCE PUT ON THE FALSE PRINCESS THE RICH DRESSES THEY HAD BROUGHT FOR ZIZI SHE WAS THEN PERCHED ON THE TOP OF A MAGNIFICENT AMBLING PALFREY AND THEY SET FORTH TO THE CASTLE BUT UNLUCKILY THE RICH DRESS AND JEWELS ONLY MADE TITTY LOOK UGLIER STILL
GO TO THE KING MASTER AND TELL HIM THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOUR LINE HOWEVER CAN I UNDERTAKE TO MAKE CLOTHES OF THAT SORT I WORK FOR QUITE COMMON FOLKS SAYS HIS MASTER GO ALONG MASTER
MIDNIGHT SOUNDED THE PRINCE AROSE WENT OUT OF THE CITY INTO THE FIELDS TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE EGGS WHICH THE MAIDENS HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS THEY HAD TAUGHT HIM TURNED THEM INTO THREE PALACES
AND TOLD HIS FATHER HE DID NOT WISH TO MARRY INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH THEM IN THE DUSK HE WANDERED ABOUT THE WOODS WHISPERING TO THE MOON NO WONDER THE YOUNG LADIES THOUGHT HIM VERY ODD BUT THEY LIKED HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT
THEN HE WENT ALL DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY TO THE BEDSIDE OF TUBBY AND FOUND HIM SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE FATHER HE SAID GRAVELY I HAVE COME TO BID YOU FAREWELL LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN A WOOD
SEARCH FOR THE DOOR FLING THEMSELVES INTO THE STREET AND TRIP TRIP TRIP BEGIN TO RUN IN FILE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL SO SQUEEZED TOGETHER THAT THEY COVERED THE PAVEMENT LIKE THE WAVES OF FLOODED TORRENT
THOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIRE THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM HOWEVER HE HAD IT PLACED IN AS FAVOURABLE A LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND SENT FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT SHE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY AND BEGAN TO CRY
BUT THE MOMENT THE PRINCE CLOSED HIS EYES UP JUMPED THE BEAST AND TOOK TO FLIGHT THE PRINCE'S HORSE AWOKE HIM UP
AS IF BY A MIRACLE ONE WAS BANDY LEGGED AND COULD NOT RUN FAST ENOUGH THE OTHER WHO HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN HASTE ONE FOOT SHOD THE OTHER BARE HAD HURT HIMSELF AGAINST A BIG STONE AND COULD NOT WALK WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE THIRD HAD ARRIVED IN TIME
WHO HAS WRAPPED UP MY NESTLINGS AND PRESENTLY SEEING THE PRINCE SHE ADDED DIDST THOU DO THAT THANKS IN RETURN ASK OF ME ANYTHING THOU DESIREST
THEY ARE COMING WITH GREAT POMP TO FETCH YOU AND YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELF TO SO MANY FINE LORDS AND LADIES WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN LIKE THAT GET DOWN AT ONCE MY POOR CHILD AND LET ME DRESS YOUR HAIR FOR YOU THE INNOCENT ZIZI CAME DOWN AT ONCE
WHITHER SO LONESOME WITH ARCHING TAIL ON THIS MUDDY ROAD I AM GOING TO THE KING YOU KNOW FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH TAKE ME WITH THEE DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF WE CAN'T BE TOO MANY FRIENDS
AND SHE GAVE HIM A SWORD OF STEEL AND A DRAUGHT OF THE WATER OF STRENGTH AND SHE TOLD HIM TO CUT OFF HER BROTHER'S HEAD AT A SINGLE STROKE AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD THESE THINGS HE WENT HIS WAY AND WHEN THE PRINCE CAME TO THE BLUE SEA HE LOOKED
AND I LOVE HER TOO MUCH TO LET HER REMAIN LIKE THIS SO HE PRESENTED THE GYPSY TO THE LORDS AND LADIES OF THE COURT EXPLAINING TO THEM THE TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE THEY ALL PRETENDED TO BELIEVE IT
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE OF HAMEL REPEATED WITH THEIR COUNSELLORS LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR
WHEN HIS HUNGER WAS SATISFIED THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIM IF I DO NOT MISTAKE YOU COME FROM FAR MAY I ASK WHERE YOU ARE GOING
MY FAITH CRIED TUBBY DO YOU WANT TO MARRY A NEGRESS AND GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN AS UGLY AS MONKEYS AND AS STUPID AS OWLS NO FATHER NOTHING OF THE SORT BUT THERE MUST BE WOMEN SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NEITHER PINK NOR WHITE
TUBBY CAME TO MEET HER AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MARBLE STAIRCASE AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS CREATURE HE ALMOST FELL BACKWARDS WHAT HE CRIED IS THIS THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY
NOT FAR FROM THE FOUNTAIN THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF BRICKLAYERS NOW FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME THE FATHER IN WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST FOUND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN DESERTED BY THE GYPSIES HE CARRIED HER HOME TO HIS WIFE
SCORCHING IN THE SUN HERE HE WAS SEIZED WITH DREADFUL THIRST HE TOOK HIS GOURD AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS BUT THE GOURD WAS EMPTY IN THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS JOY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FILL IT HE RODE ON STRUGGLING WITH HIS SUFFERINGS
WHEREFORE O PRINCE IVAN MY HUSBAND DEAR SHALT THOU BE WHEREFORE HAST THOU COME HITHER THEN HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE SAID THAT BEAST WHICH THOU WISHEST TO OVERCOME IS MY BROTHER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE YOU LOVELY CREATURE SHE SAID TO ZIZI I AM WAITING FOR MY LOVER ZIZI REPLIED AND THEN WITH A SIMPLICITY QUITE NATURAL IN A GIRL WHO SO LATELY HAD BEEN A CANARY SHE TOLD ALL HER STORY
DRAKESTAIL DRAKESTAIL WAS VERY LITTLE THAT IS WHY HE WAS CALLED DRAKESTAIL BUT TINY AS HE WAS HE HAD BRAINS AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT FOR HAVING BEGUN WITH NOTHING HE ENDED BY AMASSING A HUNDRED CROWNS
BUT GO ROUND IT AND ENTER THE ORANGE GROVE THEN GATHER THREE ORANGES AND GET BACK TO THE GATE AS FAST AS YOU CAN ONCE OUT OF THE GATE LEAVE THE FOREST BY THE OPPOSITE SIDE NOW ATTEND TO THIS WHATEVER HAPPENS
DRAKESTAIL WHO WAS NO LONGER SURPRISED AT ANYTHING RECEIVED THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE AS IF HE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE ALL HIS LIFE
THOU SHALT BE MY GRANDMOTHER IF MIDDLE AGED MY MOTHER AND IF A GIRL THOU SHALT BE MY OWN SISTER THEREUPON HE CAME FORTH AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM AND SAID
I WILL SAYS HE BUT WITH YOUR BATTALION TO DRAG ALONG YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GO INTO MY THROAT GET INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU
IS GONE LIKE A LETTER INTO THE POST AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN ALL SPRUCE AND FRESH STILL SINGING QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I HAVE MY MONEY BACK HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET HIS LADY FRIEND LADDER
NEITHER OF THEM OFFERED TO DO SO THEN HE LAUGHED AT THEM FOR BEING SUCH COWARDS AND SAID WELL BROTHERS FAREWELL LOWER ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND DON'T GO AWAY FROM HERE BUT AS SOON AS THE CORD IS JERKED PULL IT UP
SO HE PUT BACK THE BOX AND LOCKED THE CABINET UP AGAIN AND HAVING REPLACED THE KEY IN THE CRACK IN THE WALL HASTENED DOWN TO THE GALLERY WHEN HE ENTERED IT ALL THE WINDOWS SHOOK AND CLATTERED IN THE STRANGEST WAY BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT HEED THEM
IT WAS FIRST A SLOW CARESSING SOUND THEN MORE AND MORE LIVELY AND URGENT
WHOSE GREAT ESTATES JOINED HIS OWN FOR HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ALLIANCE WOULD MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER AND AS FOR THE PRINCESS SHE WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOR SHE WAS AS UGLY AS HIMSELF INDEED THOUGH SHE WAS THE MOST AMIABLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD
THEN ONLY WILL YOU OVERCOME ME WHEN YOU ENTER HERE THE PRINCE WENT HOME TOLD HIS FATHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND ASKED HIM TO HAVE A LEATHER ROPE PLAITED LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE OTHER WORLD HIS FATHER ORDERED THIS TO BE DONE
IF MY EMPLOYMENT IS TO BE ON THE DICTIONARY THE DOCTOR STOPPED SMILINGLY CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED WITH A TRIUMPH MOST DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD AS IF I HAD PENETRATED TO THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS OF MORTAL SAGACITY
INTENT ON THE CALAMITY THAT WEIGHED UPON MY HEART BUT IDLY LOITERING NEAR IT I THOUGHT OF OUR HOUSE SHUT UP AND HUSHED I THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BABY WHO MISSUS CREAKLE SAID HAD BEEN PINING AWAY FOR SOME TIME
OH HOME HOME OH DEAR DEAR UNCLE IF YOU EVER COULD HAVE KNOWN THE AGONY YOUR LOVE WOULD CAUSE ME WHEN I FELL AWAY FROM GOOD
THE HEAT INTO WHICH HE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY PUTTING HIMSELF AND THE DISTRACTED AND IMPETUOUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN DIVING DAY AND NIGHT AMONG PAPERS AND BOOKS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF LETTERS HE HAS WRITTEN ME BETWEEN THIS HOUSE
WITHOUT SEEING THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF PEGGOTTY'S BROTHER'S HOUSE AGAIN AT ONE VIEW ABRAHAM IN RED GOING TO SACRIFICE ISAAC IN BLUE AND DANIEL IN YELLOW CAST INTO A DEN OF GREEN LIONS WERE THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE
EH TROTWOOD I SHOOK MY HEAD MISTER DICK SHOOK HIS AND SIGHED TELL HIM ABOUT THE MEMORIAL SAID MISTER DICK I EXPLAINED TO TRADDLES THAT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING KING CHARLES THE FIRST OUT OF MISTER DICK'S MANUSCRIPTS
MISTER DICK IN THE MEANWHILE LOOKING VERY DEFERENTIALLY AND SERIOUSLY AT TRADDLES AND SUCKING HIS THUMB BUT THESE WRITINGS YOU KNOW THAT I SPEAK OF ARE ALREADY DRAWN UP AND FINISHED SAID TRADDLES AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MISTER DICK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM
A SYLLABLE THAT COMES OUT OF MY LIPS IT WOULD BE A BURNING SHAME UPON YOU EVEN NOW IF SHE AND I EXCHANGED A WORD I DON'T COMPLAIN
TOLD SOME MONEY INTO HIS HAND I HEARD IT CHINK WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS HE DEMANDED I CAN SPARE NO MORE RETURNED MY AUNT THEN I CAN'T GO SAID HE HERE YOU MAY TAKE IT BACK
AND DO IT AT ONCE THE WAITER IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW TO MAKE THE EXCHANGE STEERFORTH VERY MUCH AMUSED AT MY HAVING BEEN PUT INTO FORTY FOUR LAUGHED AGAIN AND CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AGAIN AND INVITED ME TO BREAKFAST WITH HIM NEXT MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK
AS YOU SAID WE COULD MAKE A LITTLE TRIP OF IT AND GO OVER TOGETHER IF IT WAS DONE MINNIE AND ME AND YOU OH I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE ME OUT ALTOGETHER SAID MISTER OMER LAUGHING TILL HE COUGHED
IT'S A MERCY THAT POOR DEAR BABY OF A MOTHER OF YOURS DIDN'T LIVE SAID MY AUNT LOOKING AT ME APPROVINGLY OR SHE'D HAVE BEEN SO VAIN OF HER BOY BY THIS TIME THAT HER SOFT LITTLE HEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY TURNED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING OF IT LEFT TO TURN
ILL REPLIED THE OLD SOLDIER MY DEAR SIR HE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS EXCEPT WELL SAID MISTER WICKFIELD EXCEPT WELL INDEED SAID THE OLD SOLDIER
LOOKING INTENTLY AT IT ALL THE WAY HERE I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME HOUSE INDEED I HAD VAGUELY ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOST GIRL
MY DEAR AND THE OTHER TWO I HAVE BY ME WHEN I LOST THE REST I THOUGHT IT WISE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT SUM BUT TO KEEP IT SECRETLY FOR A RAINY DAY I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WOULD COME OUT OF THE TRIAL TROT
SKETCHING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE I HAD SEEN AT HIGHGATE AND MY AUNT IN HER ROOM UPSTAIRS I AM NOT DREADFUL NOW DORA SAID I TENDERLY OH NO NO CRIED DORA BUT I HOPE YOUR AUNT WILL KEEP IN HER OWN ROOM A GOOD DEAL
THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT BOTH WILL CLAIM MY ATTENTION ON A FOREIGN SHORE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AS I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO ALIENATE FROM MY DOMESTIC DUTIES I HAVE DEVOTED TO CORRESPONDING AT SOME LENGTH WITH MY FAMILY
NO NO INTERPOSED THE DOCTOR PARDON ME IF YOU WILL TAKE SUCH TIME AS I HAVE AND THAT IS MY MORNINGS AND EVENINGS AND CAN THINK IT WORTH SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR YOU WILL DO ME SUCH A SERVICE AS I CANNOT EXPRESS DEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR INNOCENTLY
I WENT TO CANTERBURY FIRST THAT I MIGHT TAKE LEAVE OF AGNES AND MISTER WICKFIELD MY OLD ROOM IN WHOSE HOUSE I HAD NOT YET RELINQUISHED AND ALSO OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AGNES WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND TOLD ME THAT THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN LIKE ITSELF SINCE I HAD LEFT IT
IT WAS ORIGINALLY I THINK EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS CONSOLS SAID TRADDLES RIGHT REPLIED MY AUNT I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN FIVE SAID TRADDLES WITH AN AIR OF PERPLEXITY
WHICH WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BEYOND ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MISTER OMER TOOK ME BACK INTO THE PARLOUR BREATHING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY ON THE WAY HE THEN CALLED DOWN A LITTLE BREAK NECK RANGE OF STEPS BEHIND A DOOR BRING UP THAT TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER
WITH AN IMPLORING EFFORT TO CLASP THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS ROSA DARTLE SAT LOOKING DOWN UPON HER AS INFLEXIBLE AS A FIGURE OF BRASS HER LIPS WERE TIGHTLY COMPRESSED AS IF SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST KEEP A STRONG CONSTRAINT UPON HERSELF
AND NEVER WALKED SLOWLY ON ANY ACCOUNT AND FELT ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THE MORE I TIRED MYSELF THE MORE I WAS DOING TO DESERVE DORA I HAD NOT REVEALED MYSELF IN MY ALTERED CHARACTER TO DORA YET BECAUSE SHE WAS COMING TO SEE MISS MILLS IN A FEW DAYS
AND IN DETAIL UNMITIGATED RUFFIANS MICAWBER SAID MISSUS MICAWBER SHAKING HER HEAD NO YOU HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THEM AND THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD YOU MISTER MICAWBER COUGHED
AND THERE WAS SUCH A FERVENT APPEAL TO ME TO DEAL TENDERLY BY HIM EVEN IN MY INMOST THOUGHTS AND TO LET NO HARSH CONSTRUCTION FIND ANY PLACE AGAINST HIM SHE WAS AT ONCE SO PROUD OF HIM AND DEVOTED TO HIM YET SO COMPASSIONATE AND SORRY AND SO RELIANT UPON ME TO BE SO TOO
VAGUELY CONCEIVING THAT IN BECOMING A GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMAL I SHOULD SACRIFICE TO DORA AS YET LITTLE DORA WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF MY DESPERATE FIRMNESS OTHERWISE THAN AS MY LETTERS DARKLY SHADOWED IT FORTH
GOES INTO A CORNER KEEPING ME WITH HIM AND OPENS HIS MOUTH NO MORE I REMARK THIS BECAUSE I REMARK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT MYSELF OR HAVE DONE SINCE I CAME HOME AND NOW THE BELL BEGINS TO SOUND
LET ME SPEAK TO HIM WHO IS HE CHILD RETURNED MY AUNT TAKING MY ARM COME IN AND DON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR TEN MINUTES WE SAT DOWN IN HER LITTLE PARLOUR MY AUNT RETIRED BEHIND THE ROUND GREEN FAN OF FORMER DAYS
HAD NOT BEEN THROWN AWAY ON AN INSENSIBLE UNGRATEFUL OBJECT WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO TURN THE PAINFUL DISCIPLINE OF MY YOUNGER DAYS TO ACCOUNT BY GOING TO WORK WITH A RESOLUTE AND STEADY HEART WHAT I HAD TO DO
MY AUNT BEING UNCOMMONLY NEAT AND INGENIOUS MADE SO MANY LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS THAT I SEEMED TO BE RICHER INSTEAD OF POORER
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SHE SAID IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL TO MENTION IT CAN I OR COPPERFIELD DO ANYTHING ASKED TRADDLES GENTLY NOTHING SAID MY AUNT I THANK YOU MANY TIMES
BUT OUR INTIMACY WAS MUCH ADVANCED BY HIS TAKING ME ON HIS BACK TO CARRY ME HOME HE WAS NOW A HUGE STRONG FELLOW OF SIX FEET HIGH BROAD IN PROPORTION AND ROUND SHOULDERED BUT WITH A SIMPERING BOY'S FACE AND
BUT I REMARKED TWO THINGS FIRST THAT THOUGH ANNIE SOON RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE AND WAS QUITE HERSELF THERE WAS A BLANK BETWEEN HER AND MISTER WICKFIELD WHICH SEPARATED THEM WHOLLY FROM EACH OTHER SECONDLY THAT MISTER WICKFIELD SEEMED TO DISLIKE THE INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND AGNES
WHERE HAVE YOU PUT MY FRIEND MISTER COPPERFIELD SAID STEERFORTH BEG YOUR PARDON SIR WHERE DOES HE SLEEP WHAT'S HIS NUMBER YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SAID STEERFORTH WELL SIR SAID THE WAITER WITH AN APOLOGETIC AIR MISTER COPPERFIELD IS AT PRESENT IN FORTY FOUR SIR
AND HE KNEW THAT IN ALL THINGS WHEREIN HE WANTED HELP HE MUST DO HIS OWN PART FAITHFULLY AND HELP HIMSELF I HAVE KNOWN HIM SET OUT IN THE NIGHT ON A MISGIVING THAT THE LIGHT MIGHT NOT BE BY SOME ACCIDENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE OLD BOAT AND WALK TO YARMOUTH
WHICH YOU LOOK LIKE AND IS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR STORY I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY ATTEND TO IT FOR WHAT I SAY I'LL DO
I MADE IT A RULE TO TAKE AS MUCH OUT OF MYSELF AS I POSSIBLY COULD IN MY WAY OF DOING EVERYTHING TO WHICH I APPLIED MY ENERGIES I MADE A PERFECT VICTIM OF MYSELF I EVEN ENTERTAINED SOME IDEA OF PUTTING MYSELF ON A VEGETABLE DIET
BEING ASSISTED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO NOT LONG AGO ASPIRED TO THE FAVOUR OF YOUR HAND I AM SANGUINE AS TO THAT WOULD HE NEVER NEVER COME HOW LONG WAS I TO BEAR THIS HOW LONG COULD I BEAR IT
AND WAS GOING TO BE THE WIFE OF AS GOOD A MAN AS YOU OR ANY LADY IN THE WORLD CAN EVER MARRY IF YOU LIVE IN HIS HOME AND KNOW HIM YOU KNOW PERHAPS WHAT HIS POWER WITH A WEAK VAIN GIRL MIGHT BE I DON'T DEFEND MYSELF BUT I KNOW WELL AND HE KNOWS WELL
CAN YOU COME WITH ME SHE INQUIRED IN AN AGITATED WHISPER I HAVE BEEN TO HIM AND HE IS NOT AT HOME I WROTE DOWN WHERE HE WAS TO COME AND LEFT IT ON HIS TABLE WITH MY OWN HAND THEY SAID HE WOULD NOT BE OUT LONG I HAVE TIDINGS FOR HIM CAN YOU COME DIRECTLY
QUIVERING AND THROBBING AS SHE SPOKE I HAVE COME TO SEE SHE SAID JAMES STEERFORTH'S FANCY THE GIRL WHO RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IS THE TOWN TALK OF THE COMMONEST PEOPLE OF HER NATIVE PLACE THE BOLD FLAUNTING PRACTISED COMPANION
WELL I AM WHAT THEY CALL AN OXFORD MAN HE RETURNED
HE SAID HE WOULD EVEN HAVE SPENT AS MUCH TO BAULK OR INJURE COPPERFIELD HA SAID MY AUNT KNITTING HER BROWS THOUGHTFULLY AND GLANCING AT AGNES AND WHAT'S BECOME OF HIM I DON'T KNOW
ANSWERING IN OUR OLD SCHOOL MANNER THEN BE IT SO SAID THE DOCTOR CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND STILL KEEPING HIS HAND THERE AS WE STILL WALKED UP AND DOWN AND I SHALL BE TWENTY TIMES HAPPIER SIR SAID I WITH A LITTLE I HOPE INNOCENT FLATTERY
WELL SAID BERT I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE OF THEM ANYHOW JEST TO HELP BELIEVING I'LL BELIEVE WHEN I SEE THAT I'LL PROMISE YOU
CHAPS ABOUT THE CAMP NOW AND THEN WE GET A PEEP IT ISN'T ONLY US NEITHER THERE'S THE JAPANESE YOU BET THEY GOT IT TOO AND THE GERMANS THE SOLDIER STOOD WITH HIS LEGS VERY WIDE APART AND FILLED HIS PIPE THOUGHTFULLY
HE HIRED OUT QUITE THE DIRTIEST AND UNSAFEST BICYCLES IN THE WHOLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND CONDUCTED THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH ASTONISHING VERVE BERT AND HE SETTLED DOWN VERY WELL TOGETHER BERT LIVED IN BECAME ALMOST A TRICK RIDER
THE JAPANESE AT PORT ARTHUR THE FRENCH AT CASABLANCA IS GOING ON EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN THEY ARE FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES NO PLACE IS SAFE NO PLACE IS AT PEACE
RESUMED WORK BEFORE HALF PAST TWO THE PUBLIC MIND WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED
SUCH FIGHTING TOO I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T READ THE PAPERS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING I READ EM A BIT SAID BERT
AND BERT TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF A NUMBER OF TRADES IN SUCCESSION DRAPER'S PORTER CHEMIST'S BOY DOCTOR'S PAGE JUNIOR ASSISTANT GAS FITTER
WONDER THEY ALL GET BACK ORF TO BRIGHTON INDEED
AND OVERSHADOWED BY A HUGE BOARD THAT PROCLAIMED IT NOT SO MUCH A GARDEN AS AN ELIGIBLE BUILDING SITE HE WAS HORTICULTURE UNDER NOTICE TO QUIT THE LAST PATCH OF COUNTRY IN A DISTRICT FLOODED BY NEW AND OTHER THINGS
AN ENGINEER WHO PRESENTLY TOOK AN INTEREST IN BERT'S MACHINE IT WAS A STURDY PIECE OF APPARATUS
HE HAD A REAL PISTOL TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM BY A REAL POLICEMAN WHEN HE WAS TEN AND HE LEARNT TO SMOKE NOT WITH PIPES AND BROWN PAPER AND CANE AS TOM HAD DONE BUT WITH A PENNY PACKET OF BOYS OF ENGLAND AMERICAN CIGARETTES HIS LANGUAGE SHOCKED HIS FATHER BEFORE HE WAS TWELVE
THE PERPETUAL SEQUENCE OF TRIUMPH AND DISASTER AND SILENCE FLYING SLUMPED EVEN BALLOONING FELL AWAY TO SOME EXTENT
YOU CAN'T SAY I BIN TO BRIGHTON FATHER SAID TOM
MILK CART ASSISTANT GOLF CADDIE AND AT LAST HELPER IN A BICYCLE SHOP HERE APPARENTLY HE FOUND THE PROGRESSIVE QUALITY HIS NATURE HAD CRAVED HIS EMPLOYER WAS A PIRATE SOULED YOUNG MAN NAMED GRUBB
WE SLIPPED AWAY AND HAD HALF A DAY TOGETHER BESIDE IT AND WE PICKED FLOWERS JUST SUCH FLOWERS AS YOU PICKED THE SAME FOR ALL I KNOW
THOUGH IT REMAINED A FAIRLY POPULAR SPORT AND CONTINUED TO LIFT GRAVEL FROM THE WHARF OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND DROP IT UPON DESERVING PEOPLE'S LAWNS AND GARDENS THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN REASSURING YEARS FOR TOM AT LEAST SO FAR AS FLYING WAS CONCERNED
AND MUSING PROFOUNDLY KURT LED THE WAY ACROSS THE ROCKS TOWARDS THE DISTANT WATERFALL FOR A TIME BERT WALKED BEHIND HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF AN ESCORT THEN AS THEY PASSED OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ENCAMPMENT KURT LAGGED FOR HIM TO COME ALONGSIDE
IF THEY COULD SEE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE RAIL INAUDIBLE BUT CONVINCING THE GREAT INVENTOR EXPOUNDED HIS DISCOVERY AND SENT HIS OBEDIENT LITTLE MODEL OF THE TRAINS OF THE FUTURE UP GRADIENTS ROUND CURVES AND ACROSS A SAGGING WIRE
AND IN THOSE DAYS IF EVER ONE HEARD A MAN SAYING IN A PUBLIC PLACE IN A LOUD REASSURING CONFIDENT TONE IT'S BOUND TO COME THE CHANCES WERE TEN TO ONE HE WAS TALKING OF FLYING AND BERT GOT A BOX LID AND WROTE OUT IN CORRECT WINDOW TICKET STYLE
ALONG MADE TRACKS UPON THE GROUND
THE SOLDIER PREPARED TO LIGHT HIS PIPE LOOKS LIKE A SECRET SOCIETY GOT HOLD OF THEM SAID BERT
HE WOULD GO ROUND TO TOM AT TIMES AND LOOK AND TALK SO BRILLIANTLY THAT TOM AND JESSIE WHO BOTH HAD A NATURAL TENDENCY TO BE RESPECTFUL TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING LOOKED UP TO HIM IMMENSELY
PECULIARLY CURVED WING CASES IF ONE MAY BORROW A FIGURE FROM THE FLYING BEETLES REMAINED EXPANDED STIFFLY
THERE IS NO PLACE WHERE A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER CAN HIDE AND BE AT PEACE THE WAR COMES THROUGH THE AIR BOMBS DROP IN THE NIGHT QUIET PEOPLE GO OUT IN THE MORNING AND SEE AIR FLEETS PASSING OVERHEAD DRIPPING DEATH
FUNNY THING FIGHTING'LL BE HE SAID FLYING'S GOING TO BREAK OUT SAID THE SOLDIER WHEN IT DOES COME WHEN THE CURTAIN DOES GO UP I TELL YOU YOU'LL FIND EVERY ONE ON THE STAGE BUSY
AT FIRST THE MOST OBVIOUS ASPECT WAS THE MULTIPLICATION OF BALLOONS THE SKY OF BUN HILL BEGAN TO BE INFESTED BY BALLOONS ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS PARTICULARLY YOU COULD SCARCELY LOOK SKYWARD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITHOUT DISCOVERING A BALLOON SOMEWHERE
WE LOST ELEVEN ELEVEN AIRSHIPS CERTAIN AND ALL THEIR AEROPLANES GOT SMASHED GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH WE SMASHED OR HOW MANY WE KILLED BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OUR START'S BEEN LIKE FIRING A MAGAZINE
WHAT A MUDDLE AND CONFUSION LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BATTLES AND MASSACRES AND DISASTERS THE HATES AND HARSH ACTS THE MURDERS AND SWEATINGS THE LYNCHINGS AND CHEATINGS
THE CONVERSATION SEEMED DEGENERATING INTO AN AMIABLE WRANGLE OF CONTRADICTION I TELL YOU THEY ARE FLYING THE SOLDIER INSISTED I SEE IT MYSELF
ALL DE VORLT IS AT VOR GAW SAID BERT YESS SAID THE LINGUIST DRINKING HIS COCOA
HE COULD RIDE BICYCLES FOR MILES THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO PIECES INSTANTLY UNDER YOU OR ME
IT WAS LIKE A BOLSTER WITH A BROKEN NOSE AND BELOW IT AND COMPARATIVELY SMALL WAS A STIFF FRAMEWORK BEARING A MAN AND AN ENGINE WITH A SCREW THAT WHIZZED ROUND IN FRONT AND A SORT OF CANVAS RUDDER BEHIND
HE FLEW WITH THE EASE AND ASSURANCE OF A BIRD HIS MACHINE WAS HOWEVER NEITHER BIRD LIKE NOR BUTTERFLY LIKE NOR HAD IT THE WIDE LATERAL EXPANSION OF THE ORDINARY AEROPLANE THE EFFECT UPON THE OBSERVER WAS RATHER SOMETHING
IT MAINTAINED ITS ASTOUNDING EQUILIBRIUM AMIDST A THUNDER OF APPLAUSE THE AUDIENCE DISPERSED AT LAST DISCUSSING HOW FAR THEY WOULD ENJOY CROSSING AN ABYSS ON A WIRE CABLE SUPPOSE THE GYROSCOPE STOPPED
BERT MET IT ONE EARLY CLOSING AFTERNOON AS HE REFRESHED HIMSELF IN AN INN NEAR NUTFIELD WHITHER HIS MOTOR BICYCLE HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE SMOKED AND MEDITATED A PERSON IN KHAKI
BALLOONS IN COURSE OF INFLATION FOR THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AERO CLUB'S SATURDAY AFTERNOON ASCENT THEY GOES UP EVERY SATURDAY
THE FRAMEWORK HAD AN AIR OF DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT GAS CYLINDER AFTER IT LIKE A BRISK LITTLE TERRIER TOWING A SHY GAS DISTENDED ELEPHANT INTO SOCIETY THE COMBINED MONSTER CERTAINLY TRAVELLED AND STEERED
YOU'D HARDLY THINK IT COULD KEEP ON SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS GROWING UP AMONG THESE MARVELS BUT IT KEPT ON
WE SHALL BE BACK IN IT ALL IN TWO DAYS TIME HE SAID AND IT'S A DEVIL OF A WAR TO GO BACK TO THAT'S THE NEWS THE WORLD'S GONE MAD OUR FLEET BEAT THE AMERICANS THE NIGHT WE GOT DISABLED THAT'S CLEAR
I'M GOING TO BE KILLED I DIDN'T KNOW IT BEFORE BUT THIS MORNING AT DAWN I KNEW IT AS THOUGH I'D BEEN TOLD OW I TELL YOU I KNOW BUT OW COULD YOU KNOW I KNOW LIKE BEING TOLD LIKE BEING CERTAIN
OF LADY BONE'S CHINTZES AND CRINOLINES NOBODY HEEDED HIM THE WORLD HAD THROWN UP A NEW TYPE OF GENTLEMAN ALTOGETHER A GENTLEMAN OF MOST UNGENTLEMANLY ENERGY A GENTLEMAN IN DUSTY OILSKINS AND MOTOR GOGGLES
AND FORTY HOURS I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT WATERFALL YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME HAVE YOU HAD YOUR RATIONS YESSIR VERY WELL COME
AND THEN HAD COME THE RAILWAY
WITH A BLACK SMEARED FACE BY DAY AND A MUSIC HALL SIDE IN THE EVENING WHO DREAMT OF A PATENT LEVER CHAIN AND IT SEEMED TO BERT THAT HE WAS THE PERFECT MODEL OF A GENTLEMAN OF SPIRIT
GOT ON TO IT WITH THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF GRUBB AND
AND NOW EVERY LITTLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY HAS ITS WEEKLY OUTINGS UPPINGS RATHER IT'S BEEN THE SALVATION OF THEM GAS COMPANIES LARST SATIDAY I GOT THREE BARRER LOADS OF GRAVEL OFF MY PETATERS SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS
OR FOR THE MATTER OF THAT AN UNACCREDITED NATIVE CAN'T GET WITHIN FOUR MILES OF LYDD NOWADAYS NOT TO MENTION OUR LITTLE CIRCUS AT ALDERSHOT AND THE EXPERIMENTAL CAMP IN GALWAY NO
THAT WHERESOEVER THERE IS COLLECTED TOGETHER ANY FAIR GENERAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE A RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER AND A DETERMINATION TO DISCOUNTENANCE LAWLESSNESS AND DISORDER MAY BE RELIED UPON AS TO ONE ANOTHER
A LIGHT HAS GRADUALLY BROKEN ON HIM HE HAS REMEMBERED AT WHAT BUTCHER'S HE LEFT THEM AND IN A BURST OF GRAVE SATISFACTION HAS CAUGHT A FLY OFF HIS NOSE AND SHOWN HIMSELF MUCH RELIEVED IF I COULD AT ANY TIME HAVE DOUBTED THE FACT THAT IT WAS HE WHO KEPT THE DROVER
AND TO HIM ENTERED PUNCH WHO PUT A TOBACCO PIPE INTO TOBY'S MOUTH AT THIS SPECTACLE THE COUNTRY DOG THREW UP HIS HEAD GAVE ONE TERRIBLE HOWL AND FLED DUE WEST WE TALK OF MEN KEEPING DOGS
FOR THEY TELL OF WHAT ONCE UPON A TIME WAS LIFE UNDOUBTEDLY SUCH WAS THE SURROUNDING OF ONE CITY CHURCHYARD THAT I SAW LAST SUMMER ON A VOLUNTEERING SATURDAY EVENING TOWARDS EIGHT OF THE CLOCK
SIX AND SEVEN BEING MUCH FRESHER THAN THE STALE SPLASHES ON THEIR LEGS THESE ENGAGING GENTRY A POLICE CONSTABLE STANDS CONTEMPLATING HIS STATION WITH A RESERVE OF ASSISTANCE IS VERY NEAR AT HAND
AT A VERY DELIBERATE TROT NOT IN THE LEAST EXCITED TROTTED TO THE FOOT LIGHTS WITH HIS TONGUE OUT AND THERE SAT DOWN PANTING AND AMIABLY SURVEYING THE AUDIENCE WITH HIS TAIL BEATING ON THE BOARDS LIKE A DUTCH CLOCK MEANWHILE THE MURDERER
YOU MAY HEAR THEM IF YOU ARE LOOKING IN THROUGH THE IRON RAILS WHICH YOU NEVER ARE WHEN I AM TOASTING THEIR OWN WORSHIPFUL PROSPERITY SOMETIMES A WHOLESALE HOUSE OF BUSINESS
ON THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE A HABIT TO BE LOOKED FOR IN A HERMIT BUT NOT IN A POLICE SYSTEM ARE FAMILIAR TO US ALL THE RUFFIAN BECOMES ONE OF THE ESTABLISHED ORDERS OF THE BODY POLITIC
AND LAYING GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT THAT HE WAS THIRTY LEAGUES AWAY THE FAITHFUL DOG WAS BARKING FURIOUSLY IN THE PROMPTER'S BOX AND CLEARLY CHOKING HIMSELF AGAINST HIS COLLAR BUT IT WAS IN HIS GREATEST SCENE OF ALL THAT HIS HONESTY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM HE HAD TO ENTER A DENSE AND TRACKLESS FOREST
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY THE POLICE AND THE GREEN YARD OF THE DISTRICT BEING NEAR AT HAND WAS BACKED INTO THAT PLACE OF DURANCE AT THAT CRISIS I ENCOUNTERED HIM THE STUBBORN SENSE HE EVINCED OF BEING NOT TO COMPROMISE THE EXPRESSION
IT WAS PLAIN AND I ENGAGED TO WAIT UPON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE TO MORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I PUT MY POLICE ACT IN MY POCKET AGAIN AND WAITED ON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE I WAS NOT QUITE SO COURTEOUSLY RECEIVED BY HIM
WROUGHT IN STONE BUT IT LIKEWISE CAME INTO THE MIND OF SAINT GHASTLY GRIM THAT TO STICK IRON SPIKES A TOP OF THE STONE SKULLS AS THOUGH THEY WERE IMPALED WOULD BE A PLEASANT DEVICE
AND WOULD BE MARKED FOR DISCOURAGEMENT IF HE OVERSTEPPED THEM THAT THE SYSTEM IS BAD THERE NEEDS NO LENGTHENED ARGUMENT TO PROVE BECAUSE THE FACT IS SELF EVIDENT
IT IS SO NATURAL TO ME AND STRONG WITH ME THAT I THINK I MUST BE THE DESCENDANT AT NO GREAT DISTANCE OF SOME IRRECLAIMABLE TRAMP ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST THINGS I HAVE LATELY MET WITH IN A VAGABOND COURSE OF SHY METROPOLITAN NEIGHBOURHOODS AND SMALL SHOPS
TOUCHING WHAT MEN IN GENERAL CALL IT I HAVE NO INFORMATION IT LIES AT THE HEART OF THE CITY AND THE BLACKWALL RAILWAY SHRIEKS AT IT DAILY IT IS A SMALL SMALL CHURCHYARD WITH A FEROCIOUS
GENTILITY NOBILITY ROYALTY WOULD APPEAL TO THAT DONKEY IN VAIN TO DO WHAT HE DOES FOR A COSTERMONGER FEED HIM WITH OATS AT THE HIGHEST PRICE PUT AN INFANT PRINCE AND PRINCESS IN A PAIR OF PANNIERS ON HIS BACK ADJUST HIS DELICATE TRAPPINGS TO A NICETY
GAS LIGHTED RAILWAY STATION IN IT EXTRA THE STREET LAMPS FULL OF SHOPS TRAVERSED BY TWO POPULAR CROSS THOROUGHFARES OF CONSIDERABLE TRAFFIC ITSELF THE MAIN ROAD TO THE SOUTH OF LONDON AND THE ADMIRABLE POLICE HAVE
AND FORCES HIM TO NEGLECT WORK FOR HIM AND KEEPS HIM UNDER RIGID COERCION I ONCE KNEW A FANCY TERRIER WHO KEPT A GENTLEMAN
HE KNOWS WHERE THEY RESORT KNOWS BY WHAT SLANG NAMES THEY CALL ONE ANOTHER KNOWS HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE BEEN IN PRISON AND HOW LONG AND FOR WHAT ALL THIS IS KNOWN AT HIS STATION TOO AND IS
FOR HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE NOT ROUGHENED BY WORK AND THAT THEY TELL A TALE HENCE WHENEVER HE TAKES ONE OUT TO DRAW A SLEEVE ACROSS HIS NOSE WHICH IS OFTEN FOR HE HAS WEAK EYES
AND DRAWING AS MUCH OF IT AS IF HE WERE IN A CONSUMING FEVER THAT GOLDFINCH LIVED AT A BIRD SHOP AND OFFERED IN WRITING TO BARTER HIMSELF AGAINST OLD CLOTHES EMPTY BOTTLES OR EVEN KITCHEN STUFF SURELY A LOW THING AND A DEPRAVED TASTE IN ANY FINCH
WHO AM NOT PAID TO KNOW THESE THINGS KNOW THEM DAILY ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES AND EXPERIENCE WHEN I KNOW THAT THE RUFFIAN NEVER JOSTLES A LADY IN THE STREETS OR KNOCKS A HAT OFF BUT IN ORDER THAT THE THIEF MAY PROFIT
AND NO SUCH INCIDENT HE IS A DOG OF THE NEWFOUNDLAND BREED FOR WHOSE HONESTY I WOULD BE BAIL TO ANY AMOUNT BUT WHOSE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES IN ASSOCIATION WITH DRAMATIC FICTION I CANNOT RATE HIGH INDEED HE IS TOO HONEST FOR THE PROFESSION HE HAS ENTERED
I HAVE SEEN BOYS BEING TAKEN TO STATION HOUSES WHO WERE AS LIKE HIM AS HIS OWN BROTHER THE DOGS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS I OBSERVE TO AVOID PLAY AND TO BE CONSCIOUS OF POVERTY THEY AVOID WORK TOO IF THEY CAN OF COURSE THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF ALL ANIMALS
BUT SUCH INSTANCES OR ANY TOKENS OF VITALITY ARE RARE INDEED IN MY CITY CHURCHYARDS A FEW SPARROWS OCCASIONALLY TRY TO RAISE A LIVELY CHIRRUP IN THEIR SOLITARY TREE PERHAPS
ON THE TRAIL OF THE MURDERER AND THERE TO FLY AT THE MURDERER WHEN HE FOUND HIM RESTING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE WITH HIS VICTIM BOUND READY FOR SLAUGHTER IT WAS A HOT NIGHT AND HE CAME INTO THE FOREST FROM AN ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED DIRECTION IN THE SWEETEST TEMPER
IN A PASTORALLY LOVING MANNER AND THERE WAS HAY ON THE OLD WOMAN'S BLACK BONNET AS IF THE OLD MAN HAD RECENTLY BEEN PLAYFUL THE OLD MAN WAS QUITE AN OBSOLETE OLD MAN IN KNEE BREECHES AND COARSE GREY STOCKINGS
I ACCEPT AS PRODUCTS OF NATURE AND THINGS OF COURSE A REDUCED BANTAM FAMILY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE HACKNEY ROAD WHO ARE INCESSANTLY AT THE PAWNBROKER'S I CANNOT SAY THAT THEY ENJOY THEMSELVES FOR THEY ARE OF A MELANCHOLY TEMPERAMENT BUT WHAT ENJOYMENT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF
AS IF HE HAD BEEN TO THE NEAREST WINE VAULTS AND GOT DRUNK DONKEYS AGAIN I KNOW SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS WHERE THE DONKEY GOES IN AT THE STREET DOOR AND APPEARS TO LIVE UP STAIRS FOR I HAVE EXAMINED THE BACK YARD FROM OVER THE PALINGS AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE HIM OUT
WHEN THE RAILWAY COMPANIES FORCED IT ON POLICE NOTICE CONSTABULAR CONTEMPLATION HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN THE ORDER OF THE DAY WITHIN THESE TWELVE MONTHS THERE AROSE AMONG THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF LONDON
ENCRUSTED WITH TOADSTOOLS PIPES AND SPOUTS FOR CARRYING OFF THE RAIN FROM THE ENCOMPASSING GABLES BROKEN OR FELONIOUSLY CUT FOR OLD LEAD LONG AGO NOW LET THE RAIN DRIP AND SPLASH AS IT LIST
WITH THE PESTS OF SOCIETY OR IN WHICH AT THIS DAY
IT IS BECAUSE THAT CONSTABLE ONCE DID HIS DUTY IN BRINGING HIM TO JUSTICE WHEN HE RUSHES INTO THE BAR OF A PUBLIC HOUSE AND SCOOPS AN EYE OUT OF ONE OF THE COMPANY THERE OR BITES HIS EAR OFF
I WILL COME TO A CLOSE WITH A WORD ON THE FOWLS OF THE SAME LOCALITIES THAT ANYTHING BORN OF AN EGG AND INVESTED WITH WINGS SHOULD HAVE GOT TO THE PASS THAT IT HOPS CONTENTEDLY DOWN A LADDER INTO A CELLAR AND CALLS THAT GOING HOME
SO HE TOOK THE GIRL AND I WENT HOME FOR MY POLICE ACT WITH THIS POTENT INSTRUMENT IN MY POCKET I LITERALLY AS WELL AS FIGURATIVELY RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE POLICE STATION
A VERY LARGE NECKERCHIEF DOUBLED OR TREBLED ROUND HIS THROAT AND A CRUMPLED WHITE HAT CROWNS HIS GHASTLY PARCHMENT FACE THIS FELLOW LOOKS LIKE AN EXECUTED POSTBOY OF OTHER DAYS CUT DOWN FROM THE GALLOWS TOO SOON
SKYLARKING AMONG THEMSELVES MY PURSE OR SHIRT PIN IS IN PREDESTINED PERIL FROM HIS PLAYFULNESS ALWAYS A RUFFIAN ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A RUFFIAN NOW WHEN I
APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY OF THE ROOM AND SLIGHTLY COCKED UP HIS EVIL EYE AT THE GOLDFINCH INSTANTLY A RAGING THIRST BESET THAT BIRD WHEN IT WAS APPEASED HE STILL DREW SEVERAL UNNECESSARY BUCKETS OF WATER AND FINALLY LEAPED ABOUT HIS PERCH AND SHARPENED HIS BILL
EMERGES WITH THEM AT THE BOTTLE ENTRANCE AND SO PASSES HIS LIFE SELDOM IN THE SEASON GOING TO BED BEFORE TWO IN THE MORNING OVER WATERLOO BRIDGE THERE IS A SHABBY OLD SPECKLED COUPLE THEY BELONG TO THE WOODEN FRENCH BEDSTEAD WASHING STAND AND TOWEL HORSE MAKING TRADE
THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HIM ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIFFICULTY CAUSED BY THIS FAILING HAVING BEEN LEFT ALONE WITH THE CART OF PERIWINKLES AND FORGOTTEN HE WENT OFF IDLING
THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I LOOKED ON UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM THE OLD WOMAN WAS MUCH TOO BRIGHT FOR A PEW OPENER THE OLD MAN MUCH TOO MEEK FOR A BEADLE
WILL LUMBER UP THE WINDOWS AS IF THEY WERE HOLDING SOME CROWDED TRADE MEETING OF THEMSELVES WITHIN SOMETIMES THE COMMANDING WINDOWS ARE ALL BLANK AND SHOW NO MORE SIGN OF LIFE THAN THE GRAVES BELOW NOT SO MUCH

BUT IF ONE THING REMAIN UNCHANGED ALL THE OTHERS WOULD BE LARGER THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO AN UNDERSTANDING FAMILIAR WITH THE RELATIVITY OF MAGNITUDE AND DISTANCE THE SPACES AND MASSES OF THE ASTRONOMER WOULD BE NO MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THOSE OF THE MICROSCOPIST

REPORTER
A SMALL METAL DISK GIVEN AS A REWARD FOR VIRTUES ATTAINMENTS OR SERVICES MORE OR LESS AUTHENTIC
WHOSE WRITINGS HAVE DESCENDED TO US SAYS THAT THESE MARTYRS MET THEIR DEATH WITH LITTLE DIGNITY AND MUCH EXERTION HE EVEN ATTEMPTS TO EXCULPATE THE MICE SUCH IS THE MALICE OF BIGOTRY BY DECLARING THAT THE UNFORTUNATE WOMEN
IS REALLY NOT A TOAD AND THAT
GOVERNMENT MONDAY
THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO IN ENGLAND NO FACT WAS BETTER ATTESTED THAN THAT SWALLOWS PASSED THE WINTER MONTHS IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BROOKS CLINGING TOGETHER IN GLOBULAR MASSES
A SHORT SHARP SAYING IN PROSE OR VERSE
THEY MIRACULOUSLY ESCAPED TO PLAGUE US IF WE MUST HAVE THEM LET US BE CONSISTENT AND GIVE ONE TO THE UNMARRIED MAN I VENTURE TO SUGGEST MUSH ABBREVIATED TO M H MOLECULE

A TRANSIENT HORRIBLE FANTASTIC DREAM WHEREIN IS NOTHING YET ALL THINGS DO SEEM FROM WHICH WE'RE WAKENED BY A FRIENDLY NUDGE OF OUR BEDFELLOW DEATH AND CRY O FUDGE
HALO
AMONG THE TEMPLES OF KARNAK AND PALMYRA AND IN THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS ALWAYS BY A FREEMASON FRIENDLESS
BUT THIS VIEW WAS STRENUOUSLY OPPOSED BY THAT EMINENT AUTHORITY
IF AGE IS SUCH A BOON GOOD LAND HE'S COSTUMED BY A MASTER HAND
WITH A DYNAMITE BOMB CORPORAL
SERVICEABLE AND IMMORTAL ADDITION TO THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE HAG
THAT IS TO SAY THE EARLY WRITERS WHOSE WORK IS SO ESTEEMED BY LATER SCRIBES AND CRITICS IN THE SAME LANGUAGE NEVER PUNCTUATED AT ALL BUT WORKED RIGHT ALONG FREE HANDED
LYING ON THE TABLE HE WENT ON BUT WHERE IT IS NOW I CANNOT THINK THAT COMES OF MY SERVANTS BEING SUCH RASCALS
I FEEL MOVED TO ADVANCE YOU WELL TO ADVANCE YOU SUCH A TRIFLE AS WOULD SCARCELY BE WORTH MENTIONING BUT HOW MUCH IS IT ASKED PLUSHKIN EAGERLY AND WITH HIS HANDS TREMBLING LIKE QUICKSILVER TWENTY FIVE KOPECKS PER SOUL
A MAN PERHAPS WHO HAS NEVER BEFORE COMPASSED A SMILE
IN THE END THEREFORE I SHALL BE FORCED TO GO AND SPEND MY OLD AGE IN ROAMING ABOUT THE WORLD
LAY A PILE OF FINELY WRITTEN MANUSCRIPT AN OVERTURNED MARBLE PRESS TURNING GREEN AN ANCIENT BOOK IN A LEATHER COVER WITH RED EDGES A LEMON DRIED AND SHRUNKEN TO THE DIMENSIONS OF A HAZELNUT THE BROKEN ARM OF A CHAIR
AND THAT HIS COAT HAD PARTED IN FRONT AND WAS DISCLOSING SOME VERY UNSEEMLY UNDERCLOTHING WHAT COMFORT YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO AN OLD MAN YES AS GOD IS MY WITNESS FOR THE MOMENT HE COULD SAY NO MORE
YET HE WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE SURE SEEING THAT ALL OF US HAVE A SLIGHT WEAKNESS FOR SPARING OUR OWN FAULTS AND ALWAYS DO OUR BEST TO FIND SOME FELLOW CREATURE UPON WHOM TO VENT OUR DISPLEASURE
IF IN THE PROVINCE OF THE TOWN OF N THERE SHOULD APPEAR ANY SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD PRODUCE NEITHER REFERENCES NOR PASSPORTS HE WAS TO BE ARRESTED FORTHWITH THESE TWO DOCUMENTS LEFT EVERY ONE THUNDERSTRUCK
THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES PAID FOR THE SAME SEVENTY FIVE ROUBLES
AS A SACRED THING SO SACRED THAT ON ONE OCCASION TWO CLOSELY RELATED LADIES WHO HAD ALSO BEEN CLOSELY ATTACHED FRIENDS WERE KNOWN TO FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER OVER THE MERE FACT OF AN OMISSION TO RETURN A SOCIAL CALL
NOW SUPPOSE I WERE TO RUN UP AND PAY HIM A VISIT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ASLEEP AH HA I SEE TEA ON YOUR TABLE GOOD THEN I WILL DRINK A CUP WITH YOU FOR I HAD WRETCHED STUFF FOR DINNER AND IT IS BEGINNING TO LIE HEAVY ON MY STOMACH ALSO
EVER POSSESSED HAS EITHER LEFT ME OR IS DEAD BUT STOP A MOMENT
AND IRREFUTABLY MATERIALISED THEY STOOD STRIPPED OF ALL DOUBT AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTA SAID SOME OF THE LADIES IN QUESTION CHICHIKOV HAD LONG BEEN IN LOVE WITH THE MAIDEN
SO DEEPLY DID THOSE FAIR PURSUERS ENMESH HIM IN THE TOILS OF SMALL TALK WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE EXPEDIENT OF ASKING HIM ENDLESS SUBTLE RIDDLES
NOT AT HOME FOR HER PART THE GUEST WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS BY COMMUNICATING HER TIDINGS BUT A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM THE HOSTESS IMPARTED TEMPORARILY A NEW DIRECTION TO THE CONVERSATION
LISTEN TO WHAT MORE I HAVE TO TELL YOU TELL MAVRA THAT THE SUGAR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LOAF HAS GONE BAD SO THAT SHE MUST SCRAPE IT OFF WITH A KNIFE AND NOT THROW AWAY THE SCRAPINGS BUT GIVE THEM TO THE POULTRY ALSO
SAID CHICHIKOV WHO TOLD YOU THAT NO MATTER WHO IT WAS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN GIVING HIM THE LIE HE MUST HAVE BEEN A JESTER WHO WANTED TO MAKE A FOOL OF YOU A THOUSAND SOULS INDEED WHY JUST RECKON THE TAXES ON THEM
AND CARRYING ON WITH HER AN ARDENT LIAISON AND THAT THEREAFTER HE HAD MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE DESIRED HAND BUT THAT THE MOTHER FEARING TO COMMIT A SIN AGAINST RELIGION AND FEELING IN HER HEART CERTAIN GNAWINGS OF CONSCIENCE
OR UTTER A COMPLIMENT WHICH HE HAS ELABORATED NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE HOWEVER STRONGLY THE SAID COMPLIMENT MAY SMACK OF A BOOK OF A SURETY THE THING WILL FALL FLAT EVEN A WITTICISM FROM HIM WILL BE LAUGHED AT FAR MORE BY HIM HIMSELF
AND SUCCESSFULLY AFFECTING THE ABDUCTION AND INDEED MORE THAN ONE MAN WAS CONVERTED AND JOINED THE FEMININE CAMP IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEREBY SUCH SECEDERS INCURRED STRONG NAMES FROM THEIR LATE COMRADES
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I GUESSED IT AS SOON AS EVER YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH SO MUCH THEN FOR EDUCATING GIRLS LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL JUST SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
YOUR EXCELLENCY HE CONTINUED YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE WHAT INSEPERABLES THIS MAN AND I HAVE BEEN INDEED IF YOU HAD STOOD THERE AND SAID TO ME NOZDREV TELL ME ON YOUR HONOUR WHICH OF THE TWO YOU LOVE BEST YOUR FATHER OR CHICHIKOV I SHOULD HAVE REPLIED
IT WAS DECIDED TO HOLD A FINAL DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT ON WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE AND WHO CHICHIKOV COULD POSSIBLY BE
TO RIGHT AND LEFT DID HE INCLINE HIS HEAD IN THE SIDELONG YET UNCONSTRAINED MANNER THAT WAS HIS WONT AND NEVER FAILED TO CHARM THE BEHOLDER AS FOR THE LADIES THEY CLUSTERED AROUND HIM IN A SHINING BEVY THAT WAS REDOLENT OF EVERY SPECIES OF PERFUME
BUT ONLY A POSTSCRIPT EXPRESSING A CONJECTURE THAT CHICHIKOV'S OWN HEART WOULD TELL HIM WHO THE WRITER WAS AND STATING IN ADDITION THAT THE SAID WRITER WOULD BE PRESENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BALL ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THIS GREATLY INTERESTED CHICHIKOV
WHEREAS INSTEAD OF DRINK AND BE MERRY IT WAS WAIT FOR THE TIME IS NOT YET THUS THOUGH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN FULL OF SOUP PLATES AND CUTLETS AND ENGLISH GIRLS HE NOW DESCENDED THE STEPS WITH HIS EARS AND HIS TAIL DOWN
THE NEWS NOR DID I LOSE A MOMENT IN ORDERING THE KOLIASKA YET WHEN MY COACHMAN ANDRUSHA ASKED ME FOR DIRECTIONS
ACCORDINGLY THE SPEECH MENTALLY COMPOSED HE SAID ALOUD THAT HAVING HEARD OF PLUSHKIN'S TALENTS FOR THRIFTY AND SYSTEMATIC MANAGEMENT HE HAD CONSIDERED HIMSELF BOUND TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HOST AND TO PRESENT HIM WITH HIS PERSONAL COMPLIMENTS
HOWEVER THE LAWS OF RUSSIAN HOSPITALITY DO NOT PERMIT EVEN OF A MISER INFRINGING THEIR RULES WHEREFORE PLUSHKIN ADDED TO THE FOREGOING
SEEING THAT CHICHIKOV WAS AS RICH AS A JEW BUT
AND AS HE WALKED ALONG CERTAIN THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER WOULD KEEP WHIRLING THROUGH HIS HEAD SO THAT ALMOST HE FORGOT WHERE HE WAS AND TOOK TO SMILING AND CRACKING JOKES TO HIMSELF
THE FACT THAT I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY RICH
REPLIED THE WAITER BOWING EXCEPT THAT LAST NIGHT THERE ARRIVED A MILITARY LIEUTENANT HE HAS GOT ROOM NUMBER SIXTEEN
AND ALSO WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT HE NOZDREV HAD UNDERTAKEN TO AID AND ABET HIM IN THE ACT
AND THE OWNER OF STOREHOUSES AND SO FORTH THAT WERE CRAMMED WITH HOMESPUN CLOTH AND LINEN TANNED AND UNDRESSED SHEEPSKINS DRIED FISH AND EVERY CONCEIVABLE SPECIES OF PRODUCE NEVERTHELESS SUCH A PHENOMENON IS RARE IN RUSSIA
THAT HE FORGOT THE CLAIMS OF COURTESY WHICH REQUIRED HIM FIRST OF ALL TO GREET HIS HOSTESS IN FACT HE REMEMBERED THOSE CLAIMS ONLY ON HEARING THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HERSELF ADDRESSING HIM SHE HAD BEEN STANDING BEFORE HIM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
WHICH PAUL IVANOVITCH POSSESSED FINALLY HE DELIVERED ON CHICHIKOV WITH ACUTELY KNITTED BROWS A EULOGY COUCHED IN THE MOST CHARMING OF TERMS AND COUPLED WITH SUNDRY SENTIMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION IN GENERAL
BUT OF NO USE FOR LAYING A PLEA BEFORE A COURT
JUST THINK AFTER THIS HOW ANY ONE CAN SAY THAT THE MAN IS CHARMING I CANNOT IMAGINE
THOUGH HE COULD HAVE BORNE TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE ROTUND AND STOUT TO THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDED SCORNFUL REFERENCES TO LEAN HUSBANDS AND HINTS THAT THEY RESEMBLED TOOTH BRUSHES RATHER THAN MEN
I AM ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
WHILE MOMENTARILY CHECKING THE SPEED OF HIS HAND LEST IT SHOULD MEANDER TOO MUCH OVER THE PAPER AND CRAWLING FROM LINE TO LINE AS THOUGH HE REGRETTED THAT THERE WAS SO LITTLE VACANT SPACE LEFT ON THE SHEET
ALSO TO WHILE AWAY THE HOURS HE MADE NEW AND MORE DETAILED LISTS OF THE SOULS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT
HE SET OUT TO SEE HIS FATHER UNFORTUNATELY HIS FATHER COULD ONLY JUST SUPPORT HIMSELF AND WAS FORCED TO TELL HIS SON SO
WHAT A LUCKY FELLOW THAT DEREBIN IS AN AUNT OF HIS HAS GONE AND QUARRELLED WITH HER SON FOR MARRYING A SERF WOMAN AND HAS LEFT ALL HER PROPERTY TO HIM TO DEREBIN WOULD THAT I HAD AN AUNT OF THAT KIND TO PROVIDE AGAINST FUTURE CONTINGENCIES
SEVENTY EIGHT SOULS AT THIRTY KOPECKS EACH WILL AMOUNT TO TO ONLY FOR A MOMENT DID OUR HERO HALT
MANY OF THEIR ROOFS WERE RIDDLED WITH HOLES OTHERS HAD BUT A TILE OF THE ROOF REMAINING AND YET OTHERS WERE REDUCED TO THE RIB LIKE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAME IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THE INHABITANTS THEMSELVES HAD REMOVED THE LATHS AND TRAVERSES ON THE VERY NATURAL PLEA
ALSO SUCH CROWDS OF FEMININE SHOPPERS BEGAN TO REPAIR TO THE BAZAAR AS ALMOST TO CONSTITUTE A CRUSH AND SOMETHING LIKE A PROCESSION OF CARRIAGES ENSUED SO LONG GREW THE RANK OF VEHICLES FOR THEIR PART
VERY WELL HE SAID SINCE YOU DECLINE TO REST SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU AND QUIETLY TO AWAIT THE DECISION OF YOUR CASE IN SAINT PETERSBURG I MUST FIND YOU A LODGING HERE CONSTABLE
JUST AS THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR KINDS OF FLIES IN THE AIR PICK THEM CHILD AND COUNT LET US HAVE FACTS HOW MANY WHAT A DOZEN ALREADY YES AND HERE IS ANOTHER AND ANOTHER WHY
AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND THEN THEY SAVED THE SEEDS OF THOSE FATTENING WILD GRASSES AND SOWED THEM IN FRESH SPOTS OFTEN THEY MADE MISTAKES THEY WERE CARELESS AND GOT WEEDS AMONG THE SEED
GOD DID NOT PUT THIS WONDROUS WORLD ABOUT YOUR YOUNG SOULS TO TEMPT OR TO MISLEAD THEM IF YOU ASK HIM FOR A FISH HE WILL NOT GIVE YOU A SERPENT IF YOU ASK HIM FOR BREAD HE WILL NOT GIVE YOU A STONE
RATHER THAN THINGS WHICH ARE OLD AND WORN AND DEAD LET US LEAVE THE OLD STONES AND THE OLD BONES AND THE OLD SHELLS THE WRECKS OF ANCIENT WORLDS WHICH HAVE GONE DOWN INTO THE KINGDOM OF DEATH TO TEACH US THEIR GRAND LESSONS SOME OTHER DAY
THEY ARE ALL BUSY ENOUGH ELSEWHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER WORK TO BE DONE THANK GOD AND WHOLESOMER AND EASIER WORK THAN MOWING WITH A BURNING SUN ON THEIR BACKS DRINKING GALLONS OF BEER AND GETTING FIRST HOT AND THEN COLD ACROSS THE LOINS
FOR BOYS HAD NO POCKETS IN THOSE DAYS MUCH BIGGER THAN KEY HOLES FULL OF CURIOSITIES HE HAS GOT A PIECE OF MISTLETOE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IT IS AND HE HAS SEEN A WOODPECKER AND A WHEAT EAR AND GATHERED STRANGE FLOWERS ON THE HEATH
WHICH HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS FOR THE CATTLE WHEN THEY ARE TURNED IN NEXT WEEK BUT IF THE MACHINE CUTS ALL THE GRASS THE POOR MOWERS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOT SO
COMING SURELY FROM THAT ONE FOUNTAIN OF ALL DUTY AND ALL LOVE WHICH MAKES YOUR FATHER WORK FOR YOU THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF HER YOUNG IS WONDERFUL ENOUGH BUT THAT AT LEAST AMONG MANY BIRDS
TILL THEY STOOD OUT AT LAST IN A JAGGED SAW EDGE AGAINST THE PURPLE EVENING SKY ALONG THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THOUSANDS OF FEET ALOFT AND BEYOND THEM AGAIN AT THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY ROSE VAST CONES OF VIRGIN SNOW
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ALL THAT AWAY WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING IN ITS PLACE WHY NOT IF I TOOK ALL THE BUTTER OUT OF THE CHURN WHAT MUST I DO IF I WANT MORE BUTTER STILL
THE MORE PURE AIR WILL PASS INTO YOUR BLOOD AND MAKE IT RED AND HEALTHY AND THE MORE YOU ROMP AND PLAY UNLESS YOU OVERTIRE YOURSELF THE QUICKER WILL THAT BLOOD FLOW THROUGH ALL YOUR LIMBS TO MAKE BONE AND MUSCLE
OR WHETHER THEY WILL LET OTHER PEOPLE LOOK FOR THEM OR PRETEND TO LOOK AND DUPE THEM AND LEAD THEM ABOUT THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND TILL BOTH FALL INTO THE DITCH
IF I WANT MORE GRASS TO GROW I MUST PUT ON THE SOIL MORE OF WHAT GRASS IS MADE OF BUT THE BUTTER DON'T GROW AND THE GRASS DOES WHAT DOES THE GRASS GROW IN THE SOIL YES
OH ROBERT HAD BEEN TO BROOM HEATH AND ROUND BY CAMP MOUNT AND HOME THROUGH THE MEADOWS BUT IT WAS VERY DULL HE HARDLY SAW A SINGLE PERSON HE HAD MUCH RATHER HAVE GONE BY THE TURNPIKE ROAD
THAT WE MAY GUESS AT SOMETHING LIKE A GOOD REASON FOR THE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTH AMERICA I DO NOT WISH TO BE HARD UPON POOR PEOPLE IN GREAT AFFLICTION BUT I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PAST
USE SO SAID MISTER ANDREWS AND SO I SAY DEAR BOYS
SOMETHING VERY LIKE WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS TEMPTING GOD STAKING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR LIVES UPON THE CHANCES OF NO EARTHQUAKES COMING WHILE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE MIGHT COME ANY DAY THEY HAVE FULFILLED
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE MUST TALK A LITTLE ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND WHAT MAKES THEM AND IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THAT LET US TRY THE VERY SIMPLEST CAUSE OF WHICH WE CAN THINK
AND THE BROWN SOIL ONLY GOES UP TO IT WELL THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE COMMON SENSE NOW YOU WILL NOT SAY ANY MORE AS THE COWS OR THE BUTTERFLIES MIGHT THAT THE HAY FIELD WAS ALWAYS THERE
OR BY THE SLAG AND CINDERS WHICH LAY ALL ABOUT THEM TILL THE MOUNTAIN BLEW UP AND DESTROYED THEM MISERABLY THEN I THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXPECTED AN EARTHQUAKE WELL IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE ANY ONE
TO MY SON GRENVILLE ARTHUR AND TO HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS AT WINTON HOUSE THIS LITTLE BOOK IS DEDICATED PREFACE MY DEAR BOYS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
AND WHEN HE SET FADE INTO DULL COLD GRAY TILL THE BRIGHT MOON CAME OUT TO LIGHT THEM UP ONCE MORE WHEN I WAS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING I WENT INTO BED
UNHAPPINESS IF IT GOES ON TOO LONG WEARS THEM OUT BODY AND MIND AND THEY GROW ILL AND DIE OF BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN BRAINS MY CHILD AND SO AT LAST POOR SOULS FIND REST BENEATH THE CROSS
THAT IS BONE EARTH AND IN THEIR PLACES WILL COME OVER THE BANK THE OLD WEEDS AND GRASS OFF THE MOOR WHICH HAVE NOT ROOM TO GET IN NOW BECAUSE THE GROUND IS COVETED ALREADY THEY WANT NO AMMONIA NOR PHOSPHATES
THRUSHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND SPARROWS AND CHAFFINCHES AND GREENFINCHES AND BULLFINCHES AND TOMTITS AND THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF TOMTITS ROUND HERE REMEMBER BUT WE MAY GO ON WITH SUCH TALK FOR EVER
BUT REMEMBER THIS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEN IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE LADY WHY AND LADY WHY'S LORD AND KING LIKEWISE YOU WILL NEVER PASS A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPIER EVEN BY A PASSING SMILE
LIKE THE BUTTERCUPS WHICH DO SO MUCH HARM TO THIS PASTURE OR THEY SOWED ON SOIL WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THE SEED AND IT DIED BUT AT LAST
AND SHE IS AT WORK NOW MAKING YOU MAKING ME OF COURSE MAKING A MAN OF YOU OUT OF A BOY AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE LIFE BLOOD WHICH RUNS THROUGH AND THROUGH YOU AND THE MORE YOU LAUGH AND SHOUT
ON SUBJECTS WHICH WERE ONLY TALKED OF FIFTY YEARS AGO BY A FEW LEARNED MEN AND VERY LITTLE UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY THEM SO IF MERE READING OF BOOKS WOULD MAKE WISE MEN YOU OUGHT TO GROW UP MUCH WISER THAN US OLD FELLOWS
OH I THINK I KNOW
LOOK OH I REMEMBER NOW I KNOW NOW THE SOIL OF THE FIELD IS BROWN LIKE THE GARDEN
TO CRIPPLE THEM IN THEIR OLD AGE YOU DELIGHT IN MACHINERY BECAUSE IT IS CURIOUS YOU SHOULD DELIGHT IN IT BESIDES BECAUSE IT DOES GOOD AND NOTHING BUT GOOD WHERE IT IS USED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF LADY WHY WITH CARE
IT IS BY WATCHING THE COMMON NATURAL THINGS AROUND YOU AND CONSIDERING THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW THAT YOU WILL BEGIN AT LEAST TO LEARN THAT FAR DIVINER MYSTERY THAT YOU HAVE A FATHER IN HEAVEN AND SO YOU WILL BE DELIVERED
BUT SHALL I BE MISERABLE IF I DO NOT FIND OUT SUCH LITTLE THINGS AS THIS YOU WILL BE MISERABLE IF YOU DO NOT LEARN TO UNDERSTAND LITTLE THINGS BECAUSE THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND GREAT THINGS WHEN YOU MEET THEM
AND HOW DID MEN CHANGE THE SOIL BY TILLING IT WITH THE PLOUGH TO SWEETEN IT AND MANURING IT TO MAKE IT RICH AND THEN DID ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GRASSES GROW UP OF THEMSELVES YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY MOST LIKELY DID NOT
THAT SORT OF STUPID CUNNING INTO HIS LITTLE BRAIN AND YET GET NO MORE
A LIVE MANURE CART YES CHILD IF YOU HAD SEEN AS I HAVE SEEN IN FOREIGN LANDS POOR WOMEN HAGGARD DIRTY GROWN OLD BEFORE THEIR YOUTH WAS OVER
AND THEREFORE IT IS A FLESH AND MILK MANUFACTORY WE MUST PUT INTO IT EVERY YEAR YARD STUFF TANK STUFF GUANO BONES AND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KIN
IT DROPS ITS VENOM INTO THE TENDEREST HEARTS ALAS AND MAKES THEM CALL WRONG RIGHT AND RIGHT WRONG LOVE CRUELTY AND CRUELTY LOVE
AH YES THE OLD STORY MY CHILD WAS NOT THE EARTH ALWAYS JUST WHAT IT IS NOW LET US SEE FOR OURSELVES WHETHER THIS WAS ALWAYS A HAY FIELD HOW
I SAY GOOD BOYS NOT MERELY CLEVER BOYS OR PRUDENT BOYS BECAUSE USING YOUR EYES OR NOT USING THEM
IF YOU WILL OUT OF THE TYRANNY OF DARKNESS AND DISTRUST AND FEAR INTO GOD'S FREE KINGDOM OF LIGHT AND FAITH AND LOVE AND WILL BE SAFE FROM THE VENOM OF THAT TREE
AND THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKE NEAREST TO EACH OTHER AND TO COMPARE THEM YOU MUST DO THAT WITH THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN READ ONE PAGE OF MADAM HOW'S NATURAL HISTORY BOOK RIGHTLY
THEY TAUGHT THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BORN WITH FEEBLE AND DISEASED BODIES AND HAD PASSED THEIR LIVES IN AILING WOULD BE TORTURED ETERNALLY HEREAFTER BUT THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BORN STRONG AND HEALTHY AND HANDSOME WOULD BE REWARDED FOR EVER AND EVER
MEN OF SCIENCE DOCTORS STATESMEN PAINTERS AND THE LIKE WERE JUST THOSE WHO WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE MISLED BY THEIR OWN FANCIED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND TO BE MADE UNDULY SUSPICIOUS BY THEIR LICENTIOUS DESIRE FOR GREATER PRESENT RETURN
BUT THERE MIGHT BE MORE INSIDE I STOLE UP TO THE CURTAIN AND VENTURED TO DRAW THE EXTREME EDGE OF IT ON ONE SIDE NO THERE WAS HARDLY ANY ONE THERE
I HAD MYSELF LONG NOTICED THIS PECULIARITY IN THE CLIMATE AND ATTRIBUTED IT I BELIEVE JUSTLY TO A TRADE WIND WHICH WAS CONSTANT AT A FEW THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE EARTH BUT WAS DISTURBED BY LOCAL INFLUENCES AT LOWER ELEVATIONS
TO QUOTE YOUR POET THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG A LIFE IS THE CONSIDERATION THAT THOUGH CALAMITY MAY LIVE LONG THE SUFFERER MAY LIVE LONGER STILL
WITH THE OPTION OF A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY THE PRISONER THANKED THE JUDGE AND SAID THAT AS HE HAD NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIS CHILDREN IF HE WAS SENT TO PRISON HE WOULD EMBRACE THE OPTION MERCIFULLY PERMITTED HIM BY HIS LORDSHIP
WAS VERY MELANCHOLY TO THINK OF HAVING MADE THESE LAST ADMISSIONS SHE RETURNED TO HER ORIGINAL STATEMENT NAMELY THAT EVERY ONE IN THE COUNTRY REALLY SUPPORTED THESE BANKS AS TO THE FEWNESS OF THE PEOPLE
QUESTIONS TO WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO END WERE THEIR INTRODUCTION ONCE TOLERATED AND WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THROWING THE ONLY GUILT ON THE TISSUES OF THE PRIMORDIAL CELL OR ON THE ELEMENTARY GASES
WHICH WERE GENERALLY DISEASED LET A PERSON'S INTELLECT SHE CONTINUED BE NEVER SO SOUND UNLESS HIS BODY IS IN ABSOLUTE HEALTH HE CAN FORM NO JUDGEMENT WORTH HAVING ON MATTERS OF THIS KIND THE BODY IS EVERYTHING
THIS HOWEVER SHE NOW SET HERSELF TO DO FOR I HAD SENT HER WORD THAT MY PROSECUTION WAS IMMINENT AS FOR MYSELF I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT BALLOONS NOR DID I SEE MY WAY TO SMUGGLING AROWHENA INTO THE CAR
FOR SINCE THEY WILL NOT BE UTTERLY GAINSAID IT MUST BE SEEN TO THAT THEY SHALL BE QUARTERED UPON THOSE WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO CORRUPT THEM BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS CONSIDERATION AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PHYSICAL GUILT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO A
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT STRUCK ME AS STRANGE THAT THE BUILDING SHOULD BE SO NEARLY EMPTY I WAS ALMOST ALONE AND THE FEW BESIDES MYSELF HAD BEEN LED BY CURIOSITY AND HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THE BANK
WHEN IT STRUCK ME THAT PEOPLE IN A BALLOON DO NOT FEEL THE WIND INASMUCH AS THEY TRAVEL WITH IT AND OFFER IT NO RESISTANCE THEN I WAS HAPPY IN THINKING THAT I MUST NOW HAVE REACHED THE INVARIABLE TRADE WIND OF THE UPPER AIR AND THAT I SHOULD BE VERY POSSIBLY WAFTED FOR HUNDREDS
IT WOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO CHEAPEN THIS PRESENT LIFE MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE AN AFFAIR OF ONLY SECONDARY IMPORTANCE THAT IT WOULD THUS DISTRACT MEN'S MINDS FROM THE PERFECTING OF THIS WORLD'S ECONOMY AND WAS AN IMPATIENT CUTTING SO TO SPEAK OF THE GORDIAN KNOT OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS
EVEN THOSE WHO TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE KEPT ONLY JUST ENOUGH MONEY AT THE MUSICAL BANKS TO SWEAR BY WOULD CALL THE OTHER BANKS WHERE THEIR SECURITIES REALLY LAY COLD DEADENING PARALYSING AND THE LIKE
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE NEED FOR SOME LAW OVER AND ABOVE
BUT THERE WAS STILL A ROSY GLEAM IN THE SKY OVER THE RUINS OF THE RAILWAY STATION BELOW ME WAS THE CITY ALREADY TWINKLING WITH LIGHTS WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHED THE PLAINS FOR MANY A LEAGUE UNTIL THEY BLENDED WITH THE SKY I JUST NOTED THESE THINGS BUT I COULD NOT HEED THEM
AWED AND BREATHLESS HE ADVANCES WHEN LO THE LIGHT OF THE AFTERNOON SUN WELCOMES HIM AS HE LEAVES THE TUNNEL AND BEHOLD A SMILING VALLEY A BABBLING BROOK A VILLAGE WITH TALL BELFRIES AND MEADOWS OF BRILLIANT GREEN
SO FAR AS I COULD SEE FULLY NINETY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF THE METROPOLIS LOOKED UPON THESE BANKS WITH SOMETHING NOT FAR REMOVED FROM CONTEMPT
AND TELLING HIM THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT I INTENDED TO DO WHEN I HAD GOT INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE AIR GOD WHAT HE THOUGHT OF ME I CANNOT GUESS FOR I AM SURE THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE OF THE AIR GOD NOR THAT I MYSELF BELIEVED IN IT
IF THEY WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR ENGAGEMENTS IN THE OTHER KIND OF CURRENCY IN CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANK MANAGERS
NOW AND AGAIN I ATE AND GAVE FOOD TO AROWHENA BUT BY GUESS WORK AS REGARDS TIME THEN CAME DARKNESS A DREADFUL DREARY TIME WITHOUT EVEN THE MOON TO CHEER US WITH DAWN THE SCENE WAS CHANGED THE CLOUDS WERE GONE AND MORNING STARS WERE SHINING
THE LADIES GENERALLY WENT ALONE AS INDEED WAS THE CASE IN MOST FAMILIES EXCEPT ON STATE OCCASIONS I HAD LONG WANTED TO KNOW MORE OF THIS STRANGE SYSTEM
I ANSWER THAT IT IS YOUR CRIME TO BE UNFORTUNATE LASTLY I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE JURY HAD ACQUITTED YOU A SUPPOSITION THAT I CANNOT SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN
AND NOW BEGAN A TIME DREAM LIKE AND DELIRIOUS OF WHICH I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I SHALL EVER RECOVER A DISTINCT RECOLLECTION SOME THINGS I CAN RECALL AS THAT WE WERE ERE LONG ENVELOPED IN VAPOUR WHICH FROZE UPON MY MOUSTACHE AND WHISKERS
BUT A LARGE QUANTITY OF OILED SILK A CAR
THAT MY ATTEMPTED ASCENT WOULD BE MADE AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST ME IN CASE I DID NOT SUCCEED IN PREVAILING ON THE AIR GOD TO STOP THE DROUGHT NEITHER KING NOR QUEEN HAD ANY IDEA THAT I MEANT GOING RIGHT AWAY IF I COULD GET THE WIND TO TAKE ME
UNDUE INFLUENCE CONCEALMENT AND FRAUD FEW INDEED WERE THOSE WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO INSIST ON SEEING BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION BEFORE THEY COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO WHAT WAS PRACTICALLY A LEAP IN THE DARK
WHENEVER I SO MUCH AS HINTED AT THIS I FOUND THAT I WAS ON DANGEROUS GROUND THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE IT RETURNING CONSTANTLY TO THE ASSERTION THAT AGES AGO THE DIVINITIES WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN
I COULD SEE LITTLE BUT A VAST WALL OF BLUE PLAINS RISING UP AGAINST ME TOWARDS WHICHEVER SIDE I LOOKED AT FIRST THE BALLOON MOUNTED VERTICALLY UPWARDS BUT AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES WHEN WE HAD ALREADY ATTAINED A VERY GREAT ELEVATION
IT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM THAT THEY SHOULD APPEAR TO DO SO BUT THIS WAS ALL THE LESS THOUGHTFUL OF THEM DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY UNHAPPY BUT MANY WERE PLAINLY SICK AT HEART THOUGH PERHAPS THEY HARDLY KNEW IT
WAS EXTENUATED TO A DEGREE THAT ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF THE COURT WE SHALL HAVE SAID THE JUDGE THESE CRUDE AND SUBVERSIONARY BOOKS FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL IT IS RECOGNISED AS AN AXIOM OF MORALITY
NEITHER WOULD HE BE SO BY THAT OF THE GODS WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN AT ONE TIME INDEED I CAME UPON A SMALL BUT GROWING SECT WHO BELIEVED AFTER A FASHION IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD
I COULD NEVER THINK THAT THEIR PROFESSED RELIGION WAS MORE THAN SKIN DEEP BUT THEY HAD ANOTHER WHICH THEY CARRIED WITH THEM INTO ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND ALTHOUGH NO ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THINGS WOULD SUSPECT IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE AT ALL
FOR I FELT SURE THAT THE DARKER THE PROSPECT THE MORE LIKELY SHE WAS TO COME I TOLD HER THAT MY PLAN WOULD PROBABLY END IN DEATH FOR BOTH OF US AND THAT I DARED NOT PRESS IT THAT AT A WORD FROM HER IT SHOULD BE ABANDONED
BUT THE GREATER PART WERE FRANKLY OF A CHEAP BASE METAL THE EXACT NATURE OF WHICH I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE INDEED THEY WERE MADE OF A GREAT VARIETY OF METALS OR PERHAPS MORE ACCURATELY ALLOYS SOME OF WHICH WERE HARD
I RECEIVED MANY KINDLY EXPRESSIONS OF REGARD AND ENCOURAGEMENT WITH GOOD WISHES AS TO THE RESULT OF MY JOURNEY
IT DID MORE IT CARRIED BOTH IMAGINATION AND JUDGEMENT BY STORM IT WAS AN EPIC IN STONE AND MARBLE AND SO POWERFUL WAS THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME THAT AS I BEHELD IT I WAS CHARMED AND MELTED
HE WAS THEN REMOVED TO THE PRISON FROM WHICH HE WAS NEVER TO RETURN THERE WAS A SECOND ATTEMPT AT APPLAUSE WHEN THE JUDGE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING BUT AS BEFORE IT WAS AT ONCE REPRESSED
AND EVEN WHEN THE EVIL THAT WE DREADED WAS UPON US AND THAT WHICH WE GREATLY FEARED HAD COME WE SAT IN THE CAR OF THE BALLOON WITH THE WATERS UP TO OUR MIDDLE AND STILL SMILED WITH A GHASTLY HOPEFULNESS TO ONE ANOTHER
AND ENTERS ON THE DARKNESS OF A TUNNEL HEWN OUT OF THE ROCK WHAT CAN BE IN STORE FOR HIM ON EMERGING SURELY SOMETHING EVEN WILDER AND MORE DESOLATE THAN THAT WHICH HE HAS SEEN ALREADY YET HIS IMAGINATION IS PARALYSED
AND WAS GENERALLY UNFITTED FOR IT BY REASON OF THAT COURSE OF TREATMENT WHICH WAS COMMONLY CALLED HIS EDUCATION IN FACT IT WAS A CAREER FROM WHICH RETREAT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
AND CURSED MYSELF FOR THE MISERY INTO WHICH I HAD BROUGHT HER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT NOW I SAT AND WAITED FOR THE WORST AND PRESENTLY I SAW SIGNS AS THOUGH THAT WORST WERE SOON TO BE AT HAND FOR THE BALLOON HAD BEGUN TO SINK
I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND NEITHER CAN I QUITE DO SO NOW THOUGH I BEGIN TO SEE BETTER WHAT THEY MEAN WHY A SINGLE CURRENCY SHOULD NOT SUFFICE THEM IT WOULD SEEM TO ME AS THOUGH ALL THEIR DEALINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN THUS GREATLY SIMPLIFIED
WHAT DO YOU THINK ANOTHER TWENTY MILES AFTER CROSSING THE PAMPAS AND AUSTRALIA CAN HAVE ANY TERRORS FOR US HARDENED AS WE ARE TO FATIGUE MY FRIEND REPLIED PAGANEL I DO NOT CALL IN QUESTION OUR COURAGE NOR THE BRAVERY OF OUR FRIENDS
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK A WHITE LINE APPEARED IN A DIP OF THE ROAD AND SEEMED TO TREMBLE IN THE SUNLIGHT WATER EXCLAIMED GLENARVAN
A BUSHY SHRUB RICH IN SODA HERE AND THERE LARGE SPACES WERE COVERED WITH SALT
AFTER PAGANEL HAD SETTLED HIS SPECTACLES FIRMLY ON HIS NOSE DRAWN HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND PUT ON A SOLEMN VOICE
WHICH WAS PRONOUNCED SUPERIOR TO ALL THE PORTER IN THE WORLD EVEN TO THE FAMOUS HIGHLAND USQUEBAUGH OR WHISKY
INSTEAD OF LANDING ITS FREIGHT ON THE COAST
SUDDENLY A FURIOUS AVALANCHE CAME DOWN AN AVALANCHE OF LIVING ANIMALS MAD WITH FEAR THE WHOLE PLATEAU SEEMED TO TREMBLE THERE WERE HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF THESE ANIMALS AND IN SPITE OF THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE
HOLDING ON BY TUFTS OF LICHEN AND GIDDY AND TERRIFIED IN THE EXTREME WAS RUSHING DOWN THE DECLIVITY WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN EXPRESS AT THE RATE OF FIFTY MILES AN HOUR NOT A CRY WAS POSSIBLE
A SAVAGE WHO HAS TASTED HUMAN FLESH IS NOT EASILY PERSUADED TO FOREGO IT I WILL RELATE TWO FACTS WHICH PROVE IT BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE THE FACTS PAGANEL SAID GLENARVAN THE FIRST IS NARRATED IN THE CHRONICLES OF THE JESUIT SOCIETY IN BRAZIL
YES YES MY LAD BUT THERE ARE OTHER STATES YOU FORGOT TO MENTION WHAT ARE THEY REPLIED THE CHILD
AND PEAKS AND GLACIERS FLASHED BACK HIS GOLDEN BEAMS WITH DAZZLING RADIANCE ON THE SOUTH THE VIEW WAS MAGNIFICENT
WHAT SORT OF AN ANIMAL IS THAT ASKED GLENARVAN ONE YOU CAN EAT AND IT IS GOOD SAVORY MEAT I ASSURE YOU A DISH OF OLYMPUS I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE FRESH MEAT FOR SUPPER AND SUCH MEAT
I CAN HOLD FIRM ON THAT'S ALL REPLIED ROBERT BLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT SUCH AN ENCOMIUM
HIS EYES SLOWLY OPENED AND THEN CLOSED AGAIN PAINED BY THE GLARE OF LIGHT BUT LADY HELENA TOOK HIS HAND AND HE JUMPED UP AT ONCE AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT AT THE SIGHT OF SO MANY STRANGERS
THE FAR FAMED ARGENTINE BREED THOSE REARED IN THE COUNTRY ARE MUCH SUPERIOR TO THEIR PROGENITORS THEY ARE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR FOOD AND ONLY DRINK ONCE A DAY AND THEY CAN GO WITH EASE TEN LEAGUES IN EIGHT HOURS THERE ARE NO INNS
GAUCHOS THE GAUCHOS CRIED PAGANEL AND TURNING TO HIS COMPANIONS HE ADDED
AND SUPPOSE TOLINE TRIPS YOU UP PAGANEL SAID MC NABBS WHAT A LIKELY IDEA EXCLAIMED THE GEOGRAPHER TRIP UP THE SECRETARY OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY OF FRANCE THEIR EXAMINATION THEN COMMENCED
GLENARVAN MC NABBS ROBERT
AND FOR WANT OF BETTER WORK PAGANEL WHILED AWAY THE TIME ALONG THE ROAD BY PRACTISING THE DIFFICULTIES IN PRONUNCIATION REPEATING ALL THE BREAK JAW WORDS HE COULD THOUGH STILL MAKING GEOGRAPHICAL OBSERVATIONS
YES INTO TWO PARTIES THOSE OF US WHOSE HORSES ARE SO DONE OUT WITH FATIGUE AND THIRST THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY DRAG ONE LEG AFTER THE OTHER
TWENTY MILES WOULD BE NOTHING IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAN NEW ZEALAND YOU CANNOT SUSPECT ME OF FAINT HEARTEDNESS I WAS THE FIRST TO PERSUADE YOU TO CROSS AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA BUT HERE THE CASE IS DIFFERENT I REPEAT ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TO VENTURE INTO THIS TREACHEROUS COUNTRY
BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A CHANCE VESSEL ON THE SCENE THE MACQUARIE WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP THE NEXT STORM OR EVEN A HIGH TIDE RAISED BY THE WINDS FROM SEAWARD WOULD ROLL IT ON THE SANDS
A FEW WORDS OF WHICH WERE INTELLIGIBLE TO GLENARVAN THALCAVE SPOKE CALMLY BUT THE LIVELY FRENCHMAN GESTICULATED ENOUGH FOR BOTH AFTER A LITTLE THALCAVE SAT SILENT AND FOLDED HIS ARMS WHAT DOES HE SAY ASKED GLENARVAN I FANCIED HE WAS ADVISING US TO SEPARATE
HIS INSEPARABLE TELESCOPE ON HIS SHOULDER BELT HE HELD ON WELL ENOUGH KEEPING HIS FEET FAST IN THE STIRRUPS AND TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THE SAGACITY
OH YOU INSUFFERABLE MAJOR IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT REPLIED PAGANEL LAUGHING
LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT WITHDREW TO THE WAGON AND THE OTHERS LAY DOWN IN THE TENT PAGANEL'S MERRY PEALS STILL MINGLING WITH THE LOW SWEET SONG OF THE WILD MAGPIE
SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT IS IN AN ALIMENTARY RESPECT WHAT REPLIED THE MAJOR YOU'RE NOT CONTENT WITH YOUR SUPPER MOST LEARNED PAGANEL ENCHANTED WITH IT MY BRAVE MAJOR
AND THEIR LEGS IN HIGH LEATHER BOOTS THE MULES WERE RICHLY CAPARISONED WITH THE ARAB BIT IN THEIR MOUTHS AND LONG REINS OF PLAITED LEATHER WHICH SERVED AS A WHIP THE HEADSTALL OF THE BRIDLE WAS DECORATED WITH METAL ORNAMENTS
STONE STAIR LED UP TO THE DOOR THE ONLY OPENING AND NARROW AS THIS DOOR WAS THE HURRICANE AND SNOW
SO THAT'S THE WAY THEY TEACH GEOGRAPHY IN MELBOURNE THEY DO IT WELL THESE PROFESSORS IN THE NORMAL SCHOOL EUROPE ASIA AFRICA AMERICA OCEANICA
THEY GO TO BARTER THEIR FEW ARTICLES OF INDUSTRY HUNTING AND FISHING IMPLEMENTS WEAPONS ET CETERA
THAT IS TO SAY IF THALCAVE LEAVES ANY FOR THEM BUT COULDN'T WE GO TO MEET THEM IT WOULD SPARE THEM SEVERAL HOURS SUFFERING AND ANXIETY YOU'RE RIGHT MY BOY BUT HOW COULD WE CARRY THEM THIS WATER THE LEATHER BOTTLES WERE LEFT WITH WILSON NO IT IS BETTER FOR US TO WAIT FOR THEM AS WE AGREED
COME NOW THERE IS NO DOUBT ONE OF YOU IS VERY TEASING AND THE OTHER IS VERY CRABBED AND I MUST SAY I AM SURPRISED AT BOTH OF YOU THE PATAGONIAN WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSE COULD SEE THAT THE TWO FRIENDS WERE QUARRELING
YES MY BOY I KNOW THAT REPLIED GLENARVAN
WON HIM OVER COMPLETELY INDEED THE WIND UP OF THE CONVERSATION CONVERTED THE WORTHY GEOGRAPHER INTO HIS BEST FRIEND IT WAS IN REPLY TO A QUESTION LADY HELENA HAD ASKED
INTO NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA THE FORMER BELONGS TO THE ENGLISH IN CANADA NEW BRUNSWICK NEW SCOTLAND
I FEEL AS IF I SHOULD ENJOY MUNCHING THE LITTLE BONES HORRID BUT I WONDER IS IT SO VERY NICE SAID ROBERT MY SECOND TALE WILL ANSWER YOU MY BOY SAID PAGANEL
ARE ALSO BELONGING TO THE ENGLISH VERY GOOD AND NEW CALEDONIA THE SANDWICH ISLANDS THE MENDANA
A SORT OF TATOU COVERED WITH A HARD BONY SHELL IN MOVABLE PIECES AND MEASURING A FOOT AND A HALF LONG IT WAS VERY FAT AND WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH THE PATAGONIAN SAID
ROBERT HAD CHOSEN TO STAY WITH THEM THE BRAVE BOY LISTENED WITH ALL HIS EARS READY TO BE OF USE AND WILLING TO ENLIST IN ANY PERILOUS ADVENTURE
AS IF WITH THE KEEN EDGE OF AN IMMENSE SCYTHE EVERY PROJECTION OF THE DECLIVITY HOW LONG THIS INDESCRIBABLE DESCENT WOULD LAST NO ONE COULD CALCULATE NOR WHAT IT WOULD END IN ULTIMATELY
WHICH ACCORDING TO THE THERMOMETER WAS TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO BESIDES THERE WAS A SORT OF FIREPLACE IN IT WITH A CHIMNEY OF BRICKS BADLY ENOUGH PUT TOGETHER CERTAINLY BUT STILL IT ALLOWED OF A FIRE BEING LIGHTED
THEY RETURNED TO THE RAMADA BRINGING BACK THE STRING OF PARTRIDGES THE OSTRICH THE PECCARY AND THE ARMADILLO
HE SEEMED HALF FRIGHTENED AT FIRST BUT THE PRESENCE OF LADY HELENA REASSURED HIM DO YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH MY LITTLE MAN ASKED THE YOUNG LADY
LIKE A SMALL CAMEL WITHOUT A HUMP THE HEAD WAS SMALL AND THE BODY FLATTENED THE LEGS WERE LONG AND SLENDER THE SKIN FINE AND THE HAIR THE COLOR OF CAFE AU LAIT PAGANEL HAD SCARCELY LOOKED AT IT BEFORE HE EXCLAIMED A GUANACO
YES WE'LL FIND HIM WAS GLENARVAN'S REPLY
WHICH IT WOULD BE WELL FOR YOU TO RECTIFY I WILL GIVE YOU THIS AS A KEEPSAKE FROM ME TOLINE TOOK THE BOOK SILENTLY BUT AFTER EXAMINING IT ATTENTIVELY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR OF INCREDULITY
DEEPLY TOUCHED BY THE BOY'S GENUINE AFFECTION DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE HORSES HAD BEEN SLACKENING SPEED AND WERE ONLY WALKING NOW
IN SPITE OF THE PERFECT CALMNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE COLD WAS STINGING PAGANEL CONSULTED HIS BAROMETER AND FOUND THAT THE DEPRESSION OF THE MERCURY CORRESPONDED TO AN ELEVATION OF ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET
HE CARRIES HIS COOKING APPARATUS WITH HIM AND ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO PLACE HIM IN HIS OWN SHELL OVER THE GLOWING EMBERS THE SUBSTANTIAL DISHES WERE RESERVED FOR THE NIGHT COMERS AND THE THREE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH DEVOURING THE PARTRIDGES AND WASHED DOWN THEIR MEAL WITH CLEAR FRESH WATER
AND PLEASURE IS THE END ALREADY OBTAINED WHICH INSTRUCTION IS MERELY THE MEANS OF OBTAINING I SEE NO REASON THEN WHY OUR METAPHYSICAL POETS SHOULD PLUME THEMSELVES SO MUCH ON THE UTILITY OF THEIR WORKS UNLESS INDEED THEY REFER TO INSTRUCTION WITH ETERNITY IN VIEW
THINK OF ALL THAT IS AIRY AND FAIRY LIKE AND THEN OF ALL THAT IS HIDEOUS AND UNWIELDY THINK OF HIS HUGE BULK THE ELEPHANT AND THEN AND THEN THINK OF THE TEMPEST' THE MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' PROSPERO OBERON AND TITANIA
AS LIVED OVER THE WAY AND JIST WID THAT
THAN OF JUST WHERE ONE'S OWN WRITINGS ARE THE TEST SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE BAD POETS THAN GOOD THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY OBJECTIONS TO WHAT I SAY MILTON IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CONTRARY BUT HIS OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARADISE REGAINED
ITS GENTLER FEATURES RETIRING IN THE GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL OF THE MORE ORDERLY PORTION OF THE PEOPLE AND ITS HARSHER ONES COMING OUT INTO BOLDER RELIEF AS THE LATE HOUR BROUGHT FORTH EVERY SPECIES OF INFAMY FROM ITS DEN BUT THE RAYS OF THE GAS LAMPS FEEBLE AT FIRST IN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE DYING DAY
FOR SOME ALLEGED EXCESS OF LIBERTY THAT THE LATTER HAD TAKEN IN THE UNCLE'S HOUSE OF WHICH THE NEPHEW WAS AN INMATE UPON THIS OCCASION OLD CHARLEY IS SAID TO HAVE BEHAVED WITH EXEMPLARY MODERATION AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY HE AROSE FROM THE BLOW ADJUSTED HIS CLOTHES AND
OLD CHARLEYS FAVORITE BEVERAGE WAS CHATEAU MARGAUX AND IT APPEARED TO DO MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S HEART GOOD TO SEE THE OLD FELLOW SWALLOW IT AS HE DID QUART AFTER QUART SO THAT ONE DAY WHEN THE WINE WAS IN AND THE WIT AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE SOMEWHAT OUT
WAS ALL ABOUT MOUNSEER THE COUNT A GOOSE LOOK AISY
OF THE SECOND FROGGED COATS AND FROWNS DESCENDING IN THE SCALE OF WHAT IS TERMED GENTILITY I FOUND DARKER AND DEEPER THEMES FOR SPECULATION
THIS NEPHEW WHOSE NAME WAS PENNIFEATHER WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING LIKE REASON IN THE MATTER OF LYING QUIET BUT INSISTED UPON MAKING IMMEDIATE SEARCH FOR THE CORPSE OF THE MURDERED MAN THIS WAS THE EXPRESSION HE EMPLOYED
WHILE HIS EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM UNDER HIS KNIT BROWS IN EVERY DIRECTION UPON THOSE WHO HEMMED HIM IN HE URGED HIS WAY STEADILY AND PERSEVERINGLY I WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER TO FIND UPON HIS HAVING MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE SQUARE THAT HE TURNED AND RETRACED HIS STEPS
MEN WHO WALKED WITH A MORE THAN NATURALLY FIRM AND SPRINGY STEP BUT WHOSE COUNTENANCES WERE FEARFULLY PALE WHOSE EYES HIDEOUSLY WILD AND RED AND WHO CLUTCHED WITH QUIVERING FINGERS AS THEY STRODE THROUGH THE CROWD AT EVERY OBJECT WHICH CAME WITHIN THEIR REACH
NO GENERAL ERROR EVINCES A MORE THOROUGH CONFUSION OF IDEAS THAN THE ERROR OF SUPPOSING DONNE AND COWLEY METAPHYSICAL IN THE SENSE WHEREIN WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE ARE SO
HOW IT HAPPENED THAT YOUNG MISTER PENNIFEATHER WAS SO INTIMATELY COGNIZANT OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH HIS WEALTHY UNCLE'S DISAPPEARANCE AS TO FEEL AUTHORIZED TO ASSERT DISTINCTLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT HIS UNCLE WAS A MURDERED MAN
OF A FRICASEE OR
MODEST YOUNG GIRLS RETURNING FROM LONG AND LATE LABOR TO A CHEERLESS HOME AND SHRINKING MORE TEARFULLY THAN INDIGNANTLY FROM THE GLANCES OF RUFFIANS WHOSE DIRECT CONTACT EVEN COULD NOT BE AVOIDED
WULLY WOO PULLY WOO PLUMP IN THE MUD SAYS THE LITTLE FURRENNER FRINCHMAN AND SURE MISSUS TRACLE SAYS HE THAT HE DID
KIND SOLACE IN A DYING HOUR SUCH FATHER IS NOT NOW MY THEME I WILL NOT MADLY DEEM THAT POWER OF EARTH MAY SHRIVE ME OF THE SIN UNEARTHLY PRIDE HATH REVELL'D IN
THAT LEARNING HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE IMAGINATION INTELLECT WITH THE PASSIONS OR AGE WITH POETRY TRIFLES LIKE STRAWS UPON THE SURFACE FLOW HE WHO WOULD SEARCH FOR PEARLS MUST DIVE BELOW
IT WAS A GONE CASE ALTHEGITHER WITH THE HEART O THE PURTY MISTHRESS TRACLE
THESE OBSERVATIONS HEIGHTENED MY CURIOSITY AND I RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE STRANGER WHITHERSOEVER HE SHOULD GO IT WAS NOW FULLY NIGHT FALL AND A THICK HUMID FOG HUNG OVER THE CITY SOON ENDING IN A SETTLED AND HEAVY RAIN
WHEN I SAY NO TRACE HOWEVER
HE WAS SHORT IN STATURE VERY THIN AND APPARENTLY VERY FEEBLE HIS CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE FILTHY AND RAGGED BUT AS HE CAME NOW AND THEN WITHIN THE STRONG GLARE OF A LAMP I PERCEIVED THAT HIS LINEN ALTHOUGH DIRTY WAS OF BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG THE PARTY WHO HAD A DISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF ITS HAVING BEEN WORN BY ITS OWNER ON THE VERY MORNING OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S DEPARTURE FOR THE CITY WHILE THERE WERE OTHERS AGAIN READY TO TESTIFY UPON OATH IF REQUIRED
OR RATHER A VERY PARADISE OF PERFECTION I MIGHT I SAY EXPATIATE UPON ALL THESE POINTS IF I PLEASED BUT I FORBEAR MERELY PERSONAL DETAILS MAY BE LEFT TO HISTORICAL NOVELISTS
TWO DENSE AND CONTINUOUS TIDES OF POPULATION WERE RUSHING PAST THE DOOR AT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD OF THE EVENING I HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AND THE TUMULTUOUS SEA OF HUMAN HEADS FILLED ME THEREFORE WITH A DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF EMOTION
THAT HIS DICTA EVINCED NEITHER THE PURITY OF THE ACADEMY NOR THE DEPTH OF THE LYCEUM ALTHOUGH MARK ME HIS DOCTRINES WERE BY NO MEANS VERY GENERALLY COMPREHENDED STILL
I GAVE UP AT LENGTH ALL CARE OF THINGS WITHIN THE HOTEL AND BECAME ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE SCENE WITHOUT AT FIRST MY OBSERVATIONS TOOK AN ABSTRACT AND GENERALIZING TURN
LUCKILY I WORE A PAIR OF CAOUTCHOUC OVER SHOES AND COULD MOVE ABOUT IN PERFECT SILENCE AT NO MOMENT DID HE SEE THAT I WATCHED HIM HE ENTERED SHOP AFTER SHOP PRICED NOTHING SPOKE NO WORD AND LOOKED AT ALL OBJECTS WITH A WILD AND VACANT STARE
AND SURMOUNTED BY A CONICAL SHAPED WHITE FLANNEL CAP AND TASSELS THAT HIS PEA GREEN JERKIN WAS NOT AFTER THE FASHION OF THOSE WORN BY THE COMMON CLASS OF RESTAURATEURS AT THAT DAY THAT THE SLEEVES WERE SOMETHING FULLER
FOR I KNEW VERY WELL THAT I HAD HOULD OF HER HAND FOR THE DIVIL THE BIT HAD I IVER LIT IT GO AND SAYS I ISN'T IT THE LASTE LITTLE BIT OF A MISTAKE IN THE WORLD THAT YE'VE BEEN AFTHER THE MAKING YER LEDDYSHIP COME BACK NOW
STILL MORE WAS I ASTONISHED TO SEE HIM REPEAT THE SAME WALK SEVERAL TIMES ONCE NEARLY DETECTING ME AS HE CAME ROUND WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT IN THIS EXERCISE HE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR AT THE END OF WHICH WE MET WITH FAR LESS INTERRUPTION FROM PASSENGERS THAN AT FIRST
WITH WHAT A PRETTY SKIPPING GRACE IT OFT WOULD CHALLENGE ME THE RACE AND WHEN'T HAD LEFT ME FAR AWAY TWOULD STAY AND RUN AGAIN AND STAY FOR IT WAS NIMBLER MUCH THAN HINDS AND TROD
HINTS WERE THROWN OUT OF AN EXCITING NATURE STORIES WERE TOLD OF PERILOUS BARGAINS MADE IN A HURRY AND REPENTED OF AT LEISURE
AND IS ALTOGETHER APART FROM HIS INTENTION WORDS AND THEIR RHYTHM HAVE VARIED VERSES WHICH AFFECT US TO DAY WITH A VIVID DELIGHT AND WHICH DELIGHT IN MANY INSTANCES MAY BE TRACED TO THE ONE SOURCE QUAINTNESS
SOME IN WHOLE ALTHOUGH FILTHY GARMENTS WITH A SLIGHTLY UNSTEADY SWAGGER THICK SENSUAL LIPS AND HEARTY LOOKING RUBICUND FACES OTHERS CLOTHED IN MATERIALS WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN GOOD AND WHICH EVEN NOW WERE SCRUPULOUSLY WELL BRUSHED
OR TO CONCERT UPON ANY PLAN OF ACTION SO THAT FOR A LONG TIME HE ENDEAVORED TO DISSUADE MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S OTHER FRIENDS FROM MAKING A STIR ABOUT THE MATTER
FOR WISE PURPOSES OF HIS OWN THE PHILOSOPHER HAD OTHER WEAKNESSES BUT THEY ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OUR SERIOUS EXAMINATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE FEW MEN OF EXTRAORDINARY PROFUNDITY
AND THAT AGAIN A THIRD OF EVEN THE PROPER POETIC SENTIMENT INSPIRED BY THEIR WRITINGS SHOULD BE ASCRIBED TO A FACT WHICH WHILE IT HAS STRICT CONNECTION WITH POETRY IN THE ABSTRACT AND WITH THE OLD BRITISH POEMS THEMSELVES
MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY HAD SET OUT FROM RATTLEBOROUGH VERY EARLY ONE SATURDAY MORNING ON HORSEBACK WITH THE AVOWED INTENTION OF PROCEEDING TO THE CITY OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT AND OF RETURNING THE NIGHT OF THE SAME DAY TWO HOURS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HOWEVER
SHE WOULD MARK THE OPENING SKIES I SAW NO HEAVEN BUT IN HER EYES YOUNG LOVE'S FIRST LESSON IS THE HEART FOR MID THAT SUNSHINE AND THOSE SMILES WHEN FROM OUR LITTLE CARES APART
IT SHOULD NOT BE DOUBTED THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH WE REGARD THE ELDER POETS OF GREAT BRITAIN SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHAT IS IN ITSELF A THING APART FROM POETRY WE MEAN TO THE SIMPLE LOVE OF THE ANTIQUE
AND FAIT THAT SAME IS NO WONDER AT ALL AT ALL
I MADE LIGHT O THE MATTER
UPON THE ROSES IT WOULD FEED UNTIL ITS LIPS EVEN SEEMED TO BLEED AND THEN TO ME TWOULD BOLDLY TRIP AND PRINT THOSE ROSES ON MY LIP BUT ALL ITS CHIEF DELIGHT WAS STILL WITH ROSES THUS ITSELF TO FILL
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOBLEMEN MERCHANTS ATTORNEYS TRADESMEN STOCK JOBBERS THE EUPATRIDS AND THE COMMON PLACES OF SOCIETY MEN OF LEISURE AND MEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AFFAIRS OF THEIR OWN CONDUCTING BUSINESS UPON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
HE CROSSED AND RE CROSSED THE WAY REPEATEDLY WITHOUT APPARENT AIM AND THE PRESS WAS STILL SO THICK THAT AT EVERY SUCH MOVEMENT I WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY THE STREET WAS A NARROW AND LONG ONE AND HIS COURSE LAY WITHIN IT FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
SHOULD ELICIT ATTENTION AND REMARK
SOME ONE SHOULD DIE HE WOULD RATHER MARY WERE DEAD COLD IN HER GRAVE THAN THAT SHE WERE ANOTHER'S A VISION OF HER PALE SWEET FACE WITH HER BRIGHT HAIR ALL BEDABBLED WITH GORE SEEMED TO FLOAT CONSTANTLY BEFORE HIS ACHING EYES
SO DID I LOVE ONCE ONE ABOVE ME FAR SHE REMARKED NOT IN HER OWN ABSORPTION THE CHANGE IN JEM'S BREATHING THE SUDDEN CLUTCH AT THE WALL WHICH TOLD THE FEARFULLY VIVID INTEREST HE TOOK IN WHAT SHE SAID
OFTEN WHEN SHE LITTLE KNEW ANY ONE WAS NEAR HER THERE WAS ONE OF HER COMPANIONS I NEVER COULD ABIDE
BUT HERS WERE EVER OPEN AND CONTAINED IN THEIR SOFT DEATHLY LOOK SUCH MUTE REPROACH WHAT HAD SHE DONE TO DESERVE SUCH CRUEL TREATMENT FROM HIM SHE HAD BEEN WOOED BY ONE WHOM JEM KNEW TO BE HANDSOME GAY AND BRIGHT
OH COULD HE THEN DO NOTHING FOR HER SHE SPOKE AGAIN BUT IN A LESS EXCITED TONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS THRILLINGLY EARNEST YOU ARE GRIEVED FOR ME
AND BID HER FOR THE SAKE OF ONE WHO LOVED HER WELL TRY AND COMFORT MY POOR AUNT ALICE DEAR OLD AUNT YOU AND MARGARET WILL OFTEN GO AND SEE HER WON'T YOU SHE'S SADLY FAILED SINCE I WAS LAST ASHORE
THAT I'D GO AND SEE HIM AND HIS THIS TIME OF COMING ASHORE I MUST GO I'M SORRY ENOUGH BUT I MUSTN'T SLIGHT POOR MOTHER'S FRIENDS I MUST GO DON'T TRY TO KEEP ME SAID HE
MARY TOOK HER SEWING AFTER HE HAD GONE AND SAT ON AND SAT ON
HE'LL BE IN A FIDGET TILL YOU'RE GETTEN TO BED I KNOW SO YOU MUN BE QUIET IF YOU ARE SO BENT UPON STAYING UP AND QUIETLY NOISELESSLY MARY WATCHED THE UNCHANGING WEATHER COCK THROUGH THE NIGHT
I MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH THE MONEY I SEE NOW
YES THEY'VE GIVEN HIM A SOVEREIGN
BUT I TURN AWAY AND WORK AWAY AND TRY NEVER TO THINK ON THE WIND
BUT HER AGE IS AGAIN HER HE'S ORDERED HER LEECHES TO HER HEAD MARGARET HAVING TOLD HER TALE LEANT BACK WITH WEARINESS BOTH OF BODY AND MIND MARY HASTENED TO MAKE HER A CUP OF TEA WHILE JOB
AND AS IF ALL THIS AGGREGATE OF SORROWFUL THOUGHTS WAS NOT ENOUGH
NO HE WERE GONE BEFORE I GOT THERE SAID MARGARET
ALICE HER DULLED SENSES DEADENING DAY BY DAY SAT MUTELY NEAR THE FIRE
BUT WHICH NOW IN RETROSPECTION SEEMED SO HAPPY AND UNCLOUDED ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN KNOWN WHERE TO MEET WITH JOHN BARTON ON THAT UNFORTUNATE NIGHT WHICH HAD ONLY PRODUCED IRRITATION IN HIM AND A MONTH'S IMPRISONMENT TO HER
HE HAD NOT DONE ENOUGH TO SAVE HER ONE MORE EFFORT AND SHE MIGHT HAVE COME NAY TWENTY EFFORTS WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL REWARDED BY HER YIELDING HE TURNED BACK BUT SHE WAS GONE
AND HIMSELF FOR HIS WEAKNESS IN YIELDING TO HER OBSTINACY WHEN SHE INSISTED ON BEING THE ONE TO FOLLOW AND FIND OUT WILL SHE DID NOT PASS THAT NIGHT IN BED ANY MORE THAN JOB BUT SHE WAS UNDER A RESPECTABLE ROOF AND AMONG KIND THOUGH ROUGH PEOPLE
THREATENED TO TURN US OUT UNLESS HIS RENT WAS PAID
AGAINST THE WALL WERE WAFERED TWO ROUGH DRAWINGS OF VESSELS WITH THEIR NAMES WRITTEN UNDERNEATH ON WHICH THE MOTHER'S EYES CAUGHT AND GAZED UNTIL THEY FILLED WITH TEARS BUT SHE BRUSHED THE DROPS AWAY WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND
BUT I WAS I HAD A LITTLE GIRL TOO OH THE SWEETEST DARLING THAT EVER WAS SEEN BUT I MUST NOT THINK OF HER PUTTING HER HAND WILDLY UP TO HER FOREHEAD OR I SHALL GO MAD I SHALL
HE INTERRUPTED HIS EARNEST GAZE INTO HER FACE WITH THE EXCLAMATION AND WHO CAN YO BE TO KNOW MARY BARTON OR TO KNOW THAT SHE'S OUGHT TO ME
HER VOICE ROSE AGAIN TO THE SHARP PITCH OF AGONY MY DARLING MY DARLING
AND MAY BE A TRIFLE FOR PRESENTS
AND I WANT A DRAM MORE THAN EVER AGAIN SHE RAPIDLY TURNED OFF AND JEM ALSO WENT ON HIS WAY BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE JEALOUS ANGUISH THAT FILLED HIS HEART HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM
SOME YEARS AGO YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED ME AS I HOPE AND TRUST YOU WILL YET SAVE MARY
I WONDER IF SHE WILL EVER THINK ON ME WHEN THE WIND IS WHISTLING AND THE GALE RISING YOU'LL OFTEN SPEAK OF ME TO HER MARY AND IF I SHOULD MEET WITH ANY MISCHANCE TELL HER HOW DEAR HOW VERY DEAR SHE WAS TO ME
DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE ABOUT YOURSEL SAID JEM SOOTHINGLY WHAT YOU'RE TIRED ALREADY ARE YOU
A SORT OF PRESENTIMENT OF EVIL OR PERHAPS ONLY AN EXCESS OF LOW SPIRITED FEELING IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TWO DEPARTURES WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE THAT AFTERNOON
AY I DARE SAY IT'S BEST ONE THING I DO WISH THOUGH AND I HAVE OFTEN WISHED IT WHEN OUT ALONE ON THE DEEP SEA
IN FALLING WRENCHED THEM WITH SUCH CRUEL FORCE THAT THOUGH WE COVERED THEM AGAIN WITH CARE ITS BEAUTY WITHERED AND IT PINED AWAY SO COULD WE LOOK INTO THE HUMAN BREAST HOW OFT THE FATAL BLIGHT THAT MEETS OUR VIEW
JEM YOU WILL SAVE HER WITH HEART AND SOUL THOUGH IN FEW WORDS JEM PROMISED THAT IF AUGHT EARTHLY COULD KEEP HER FROM FALLING HE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE BLESSED HIM AND BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
I USED TO WATCH ABOUT THE COURT WHERE JOHN LIVED FOR MANY AND MANY A NIGHT AND GATHER ALL I COULD ABOUT THEM FROM THE NEIGHBOURS TALK
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE A BIT LONELY TO NIGHT
OH GRANDFATHER IF I COULD BUT SEE SHE SOBBED A LITTLE AND THEY LET HER GIVE THAT EASE TO HER HEART THEN SHE WENT ON NO I WENT ROUND BY MISSUS DAVENPORT'S AND SHE WERE HARD AT WORK BUT
WHO WOULD THEN GUARD MARY WITH HER LOVE AND HER INNOCENCE WOULD IT NOT BE A GOODLY THING TO SERVE HER ALTHOUGH SHE LOVED HIM NOT TO BE HER PRESERVING ANGEL THROUGH THE PERILS OF LIFE AND SHE UNCONSCIOUS ALL THE WHILE
GIVING A GREAT SLAP OF ONE HAND ON HER BACK THE ROOM WAS LIGHT AND BRIGHT AND ROUSED MARY PERHAPS THE SLAP ON HER BACK MIGHT HELP A LITTLE TOO AND SHE FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF ACCOUNTING FOR HER PRESENCE TO A LITTLE BUSTLING OLD WOMAN
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I KNOW I BELIEVE WHO SEEMS FREE FROM CARE HER BLINDNESS ALMOST APPEARS A BLESSING SOMETIMES SHE WAS SO DOWNHEARTED WHEN SHE DREADED IT AND NOW SHE SEEMS SO CALM AND HAPPY WHEN IT'S DOWNRIGHT COME
HE ONLY REMEMBERED IT TO BE THANKFUL HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION OF TRYING HIS FATE AGAIN NOT IN ACTUAL WORDS BUT IN A MEETING WHERE HER MANNER SHOULD TELL FAR MORE THAN WORDS THAT HER SWEETER SMILES HER DAINTY MOVEMENTS
ELSE THEY PARSECUTE ME AND SARVE ME OUT WHAT COULD HER FATHER BE DOING UP STAIRS TRAMPING AND BANGING ABOUT WHY DID HE NOT COME DOWN OR WHY DID NOT JOB GO THE SUPPER WOULD BE SPOILT
NOW THE GREAT THING WAS TO REACH HOME AND SOLITUDE MARY LOVED ANOTHER OH HOW SHOULD HE BEAR IT HE HAD THOUGHT HER REJECTION OF HIM A HARD TRIAL BUT THAT WAS NOTHING NOW
HAD HE NOT PROMISED WITH SUCH EARNEST PURPOSE OF SOUL AS MAKES WORDS MORE SOLEMN THAN OATHS TO SAVE MARY FROM BECOMING SUCH AS ESTHER SHOULD HE SHRINK FROM THE DUTIES OF LIFE INTO THE COWARDLINESS OF DEATH
YES SHE'S WELL ENOUGH SHE'S MEANING TO GO AND KEEP ALICE WILSON COMPANY FOR AN HOUR OR SO THIS EVENING AS SOON AS SHE THINKS HER NEPHEW WILL HAVE STARTED FOR LIVERPOOL
PLEASE GOD THAT WAS ALWAYS HER WORD AND LIVE NEAR HER OLD HOME BEYOND LANCASTER
NOT THAT SHE'S SO DARK AS NOT TO SEE A COACH OR A CART LIKE A BIG BLACK THING BUT SHE CAN'T RIGHTLY JUDGE HOW FAR OFF IT IS BY SIGHT SO SHE LISTENS HARK THAT'S HER YES IN SHE CAME
UNTO HIS ORDER HE WAS A NOBLE POST

I WAS NOT AWARE WHEN I CAME TO THE COURT OF FRANCE THAT PRINCESSES OF MY RANK WERE TO BE REGARDED AS THE WOMEN IN TURKEY ARE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SEEN BUT SINCE SUCH IS YOUR DESIRE I WILL CONFORM MYSELF TO IT
THIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER HOUSE UPON WHEELS EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE QUARTER IN WHICH HE RESIDED IT WAS COVERED WITH ALLEGORICAL PAINTINGS AND CLOUDS SCATTERED OVER WITH STARS

THESE YOUNG WOMEN EASILY TAKE OFFENSE TO REPROACH THEM FOR AN ERROR THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED IS SOMETIMES ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO TELLING THEM THEY MIGHT BE GUILTY OF EVEN WORSE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD BUT WAIT A MINUTE DO NOT FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE JUST THIS MOMENT SAID

FOR THE REST A JOYOUS BEAM OF THE SUN FOR THE SUN APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE FOR THE LOSS FRANCE HAD JUST SUFFERED A SUNBEAM WE SAY DESCENDED UPON THEM DRAWING PERFUMES FROM THE NEIGHBORING FLOWERS AND ANIMATING THE WALLS THEMSELVES
MONSIEUR THEN APPROACHED THEM SAYING IN A HOARSE TONE OF VOICE I AM DELIGHTED I CAME HERE EXPECTING TO FIND YOU ILL AND LOW SPIRITED AND I FIND YOU ABANDONING YOURSELF TO NEW AMUSEMENTS REALLY IT IS MOST FORTUNATE

THIS MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK THEY WERE PLAYING MUSIC IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS NO HARM IN THAT SURELY
AS MUCH FOR BED AND SUPPER
YOU SEEM TO COME ON A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE SAID HE TO RAOUL AFTER HE HAD EMBRACED HIM
SHE SET HER TEETH AND STRODE THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT STARING WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AT WHAT SHE SAW MY GOD SHE BREATHED LONDON
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
NOBODY OUTSIDE THE OFFICE SAID MANSUS UNLESS UNLESS UNLESS WHAT ASKED THE OTHER IRRITABLY DON'T BE A JIMP MANSUS GET IT OFF YOUR MIND WHAT IS IT I AM WONDERING SAID MANSUS SLOWLY
HE IS VERY RICH HAS NO RELATIONS AND HAS A PASSION FOR POWER THEN HE'LL BE HUNG SAID THE CHIEF RISING I DOUBT IT SAID THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY SELDOM GET HUNG YOU ONLY GET HUNG FOR WANTING MONEY
THE CASE WAS COMPLETE BUT WHAT CLINCHED THE MATTER WAS THE FINDING OF A WAD OF THAT PECULIAR CHEMICAL PAPER
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
WHEN SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE FOUND HERSELF LYING ON A PLAIN STRETCHER BED SHE SAT UP SUDDENLY
JOHN LEXMAN WOULD BE PARDONED EVERY STREAM IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD BEEN DRAGGED IN ONE CASE A SMALL RIVER HAD BEEN DAMMED AND THE BED HAD BEEN CAREFULLY DRIED AND SIFTED BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE WEAPON AND T X HAD TRIED METHODS MORE EFFECTIVE AND CERTAINLY LESS LEGAL
CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOB FOR THE PURPOSE AND LET IT FALL GENTLY INTO THE SOCKET WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO RECEIVE IT ON THE DOOR ITSELF RUM COVE HE SAID AGAIN AND LIFTING THE LATCH TO THE HOOK WHICH HELD IT UP LEFT THE ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
HE WAS A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION IF ONLY FROM THE SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC NATURE OF HIS DRESS AND HIS UNKEMPT APPEARANCE HE WAS DRESSED IN A WELL WORN OVERCOAT OF A SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED CHECK HE HAD A TOP HAT GLOSSY AND OBVIOUSLY NEW AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
I AM GOING TO PUT YOU INTO SAFE CUSTODY HE SAID ON THE WHOLE I THINK IT IS BEST THAT THE POLICE TAKE THIS MATTER IN HAND AND I SHALL LOCK YOU INTO MY WINE CELLAR AND GO OUT IN SEARCH OF A POLICEMAN THE BIG WOODEN DOOR OPENED REVEALING A SECOND DOOR
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
I AM A POLICE OFFICER AND I WANT YOU TO COME ALONG WITH ME AND OF COURSE HE SHUT UP AND WOULD NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD SAID T X THAT'S TRUE SIR SAID MANSUS BUT AFTER AWHILE I GOT HIM TO TALK
AND WHO BROUGHT TO BOOK SIR JULIUS WAGLITE THOUGH HE HAD COVERED HIS TRAIL OF DEFALCATION THROUGH THE BALANCE SHEETS OF THIRTY FOUR COMPANIES
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
AND THE HOME SECRETARY BY SIMPLY EXPOSING THEM FOR A FEW SECONDS TO THE LIGHT OF AN ELECTRIC LAMP INSTANTLY IT HAD FILLED THE HOME SECRETARY'S OFFICE WITH A PUNGENT AND MOST DISAGREEABLE SMOKE FOR WHICH HE WAS HEARTILY CURSED BY HIS SUPERIORS
HE WAS ABREAST OF HER WHEN HE SUDDENLY SWUNG ROUND AND CATCHING HER IN HIS ARMS HE CAUGHT HER CLOSE TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD REALISE WHAT HE PLANNED HE HAD STOOPED SWIFTLY AND KISSED HER FULL UPON THE MOUTH IF YOU SCREAM I SHALL KISS YOU AGAIN HE SAID
DETAIN HIM ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER BECAUSE HE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF AND I WANT TO SEE HIM
BURNT THE LOCKS FROM HIS SAFE AND SECURED THE NECESSARY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
BEGAN THE CHIEF FUNNY BUSINESS INTERRUPTED T X NOT A BIT HOUSE AND MAN ARE QUITE NORMAL SAVE FOR THESE ECCENTRICITIES HE HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF SPENDING THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN ENGLAND AND NINE MONTHS ABROAD
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
SIR GEORGE SMILED GRIMLY I HAVE THE INTEREST WHICH IS THE INTEREST OF MY DEPARTMENT HE SAID THAT IS TO SAY I WANT TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABNORMAL PEOPLE WE HAVE HAD AN APPLICATION FROM HIM HE WENT ON WHICH IS RATHER UNUSUAL
SHE EXAMINED THE ROOM CAREFULLY AT THE FARTHERMOST END WAS ANOTHER DOOR AND THIS SHE PUSHED GENTLY AT FIRST AND THEN VIGOROUSLY WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION SHE STILL HAD HER BAG A SMALL AFFAIR OF BLACK MOIRE WHICH HUNG FROM HER BELT
HE USED THE ADELPHI ADDRESS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
HE SHIVERED AS HE GLANCED INTO THE BLEAK STREET KEEP MY FIRE GOING PUT ALL MY PRIVATE LETTERS IN MY BEDROOM AND SEE THAT MISS HOLLAND HAS HER LUNCH FISHER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR WRAPPED THE FUR RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS
SIR GEORGE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO THE ARM CHAIR AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG THIN LEGS WHAT I WANT HE SAID LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING AND PUTTING HIS HANDS TOGETHER
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
THEN YOU'RE IN SOME DANGER T X SMILED THE CHIEF FOR ACCORDING TO MY ACCOUNT YOU'RE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS BROKE A GENIAL LIBEL SAID T X BUT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING BROKE I SAW JOHN LEXMAN TO DAY YOU KNOW HIM THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER NODDED
I'VE AN IDEA HE'S RATHER HIT FOR MONEY HE WAS IN THAT ROUMANIAN GOLD SWINDLE AND BY HIS GENERAL GLOOM WHICH ONLY COMES TO A MAN WHEN HE'S IN LOVE AND HE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE IN LOVE SINCE HE'S MARRIED OR WHEN HE'S IN DEBT I FEAR THAT HE IS STILL FEELING THE EFFECT OF THAT ROSY ADVENTURE
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
AS THEY SPUN DOWN TO THE VALLEY OF THE DART MANSUS TOUCHED HIS ARM LOOK AT THAT HE SAID AND POINTED TO THE BLUE HEAVENS WHERE A MILE ABOVE THEIR HEADS A WHITE WINGED AEROPLANE LOOKING NO LARGER THAN A VERY DISTANT DRAGON FLY SHIMMERED IN THE SUNLIGHT
BUT IN THIS SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THE GRIP ABOUT HER ARM WAS A GRIP OF STEEL AND SHE KNEW SAFETY DID NOT LIE IN THAT DIRECTION SHE PULLED BACK AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS THAT LED DOWN TO THE KITCHEN WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME SHE ASKED
HE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH A MEDITATIVE FROWN AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HALL HE WAS LESS THAN HALF WAY DOWN WHEN THE ONE MAID OF KARA'S HOUSEHOLD CAME UP TO MEET HIM THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS TO SEE MISTER KARA SHE SAID HERE IS HIS CARD
SWEET LAVENDER AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE BIG BALLROOM AT HEVER COURT HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A THEATRE AS HE WAS UNDRESSING FOR BED THAT NIGHT T X REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD MENTIONED TO KARA THAT SWEET LAVENDER WAS HIS FAVORITE PLAY
THERE WAS A THICK CARPET ON THE FLOOR COMFORTABLE EASY CHAIRS A LITTLE BOOKCASE WELL FILLED AND A READING LAMP THIS MUST BE KARA'S UNDERGROUND STUDY WHERE HE KEPT HIS PRECIOUS PAPERS
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
WITH ROSY HELD IN THE CLUTCHES OF MORPHEUS FOR A MANY HOURS DEEP SLUMBER AND THE BLOODTHIRSTY PARENT WAITING ARMED AND FOREWARNED IKEY FELT THAT HIS RIVAL WAS CLOSE INDEED UPON DISCOMFITURE
OF THROWING A FILM OVER HIS EYES RENDERING OPAQUE THE WINDOWS OF HIS SOUL ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID WITH EGREGIOUS EXCUSES I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES
EVEN PITCHER'S FACE RELAXED INTO SOMETHING RESEMBLING ANIMATION ON THE EXCHANGE THERE WERE HURRICANES AND LANDSLIDES AND SNOWSTORMS AND GLACIERS AND VOLCANOES AND THOSE ELEMENTAL DISTURBANCES
THERE ARE BUT TWO SUBJECTS UPON WHICH ONE MAY DISCOURSE WITH A FREE IMAGINATION AND WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING CONTROVERTED YOU MAY TALK OF YOUR DREAMS AND YOU MAY TELL WHAT YOU HEARD A PARROT SAY
AND THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO BE GETTING ANY OF US OUT A FLY COP AN ANGEL POLICEMAN FLEW OVER TO ME AND TOOK ME BY THE LEFT WING NEAR AT HAND WAS A GROUP OF VERY PROSPEROUS LOOKING SPIRITS ARRAIGNED FOR JUDGMENT
BY SUCH EPITHET WAS PIGGY KNOWN TO UNFORTUNATE ONES WHO HAD TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY DULCIE TURNED TO THE DRESSER TO GET HER HANDKERCHIEF AND THEN SHE STOPPED STILL AND BIT HER UNDERLIP HARD WHILE LOOKING IN HER MIRROR
AND BORE THEM OUTSIDE STILL RESISTING

WE SHUDDERED TO THINK OF MILLY WITH HER VOICE MODULATED AND HER ELBOWS COVERED POURING TEA IN THE MARBLE TEEPEE OF A TREE MURDERER NO IN CYPHER'S SHE BELONGED IN THE BACON SMOKE THE CABBAGE PERFUME THE GRAND WAGNERIAN CHORUS OF HURLED IRONSTONE CHINA AND RATTLING CASTERS
WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST

BUT CLING TO THEIR CITIES HEM AS A CHILD TO THE MOTHER'S GOWN NOT SO E RUSHMORE COGLAN WITH THE WHOLE WORLD FOR HIS MY MEDITATIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A TREMENDOUS NOISE AND CONFLICT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CAFE I SAW ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE SEATED PATRONS
A CALENDAR ISSUED BY A PICKLE WORKS A BOOK ON THE DIVINATION OF DREAMS SOME RICE POWDER IN A GLASS DISH AND A CLUSTER OF ARTIFICIAL CHERRIES TIED WITH A PINK RIBBON
DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
IT IS A FANCY OF MINE TO RENDER AID TO OTHERS WHOM I THINK WORTHY OF IT PERHAPS THE MATTER THAT SEEMS TO DISTRESS YOU IS ONE THAT WOULD MORE READILY YIELD TO OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY AT THE PRINCE

WITH A HOT INFUSION OF THE CHUCHULA WEED
AND THERE WAS NO ROOM IN IT FOR THE HUMAN WORLD OR THE WORLD OF NATURE WHEN THE LUNCHEON HOUR DREW NEAR THERE CAME A SLIGHT LULL IN THE UPROAR MAXWELL STOOD BY HIS DESK WITH HIS HANDS FULL OF TELEGRAMS AND MEMORANDA
IT MIGHT BRACE HER UP AND KEEP HER FROM RENEGING ON THE PROPOSITION TO SKIP I GUESS SHE DON'T NEED A MULE TEAM TO DRAG HER AWAY BUT WOMEN ARE BETTER AT COACHING THAN THEY ARE AT RUNNING BASES
WHAT DOES YOUR MAJESTY PLEASE TO WANT YOU CAN'T SMOKE MORE THAN YOU DO YOU WON'T DRINK YOU'RE A GROSS FEEDER AND YOU DRESS IN THE DARK BY THE LOOK OF YOU YOU WOULDN'T KEEP A HORSE THE OTHER DAY WHEN I SUGGESTED

DON'T YOU THINK PERHAPS YOU HAD ALMOST BETTER GO NOW HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR HIMSELF AS A MAN IF THE STRAIN CONTINUED MUCH LONGER I DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING ELSE I'LL GO DICK
DAYS WEEKS OR MONTHS ONE CAN NEVER TELL IT MAY GO ON FOR YEARS
PIG CHINESE PIG I'VE WORKED FOR THIS I'VE SWEATED AND I'VE STARVED FOR THIS LINE ON LINE AND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND NOW I'VE GOT IT I AM GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT WHILE IT LASTS LET THEM PAY THEY'VE NO KNOWLEDGE
WE'LL RANT AND WE'LL ROAR ACROSS THE SALT SEAS UNTIL WE TAKE SOUNDINGS IN THE CHANNEL OF OLD ENGLAND FROM USHANT TO SCILLY
THOSE LITTLE STATES ARE ALWAYS SCREECHING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT DICK'S LUCK YES HE HAS BEEN CALLED UP TO NOTORIETY HASN'T HE I HOPE YOU KEEP HIM PROPERLY HUMBLE HE WANTS SUPPRESSING FROM TIME TO TIME HE DOES
YET WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE PARK THE SCOPE OF HIS VISION WAS NOT CONTRACTED HE COULD SEE PERFECTLY UNTIL A PROCESSION OF SLOW WHEELING FIREWORKS DEFILED ACROSS HIS EYEBALLS LITTLE DORGLUMS WE AREN'T AT ALL WELL LET'S GO HOME
I'D FLAY HIM MYSELF BUT I LIKE HIM TOO MUCH I'VE NO SCRUPLES HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TRY TO CUT ME OUT WITH A WOMAN AT CAIRO ONCE I FORGOT THAT BUT I REMEMBER NOW
I COULD HAVE SAID A GOOD DEAL
I TOOK MY LAST SHOT BACK BEHOLD THE RESULT
ONLY THE FREE ARE BOND AND ONLY THE BOND ARE FREE TELL HIM HE'S AN IDIOT TORP AND TELL HIM I'M ANOTHER
GREAT NEWS HE WROTE THE NILGHAI KNOWS AND SO DOES THE KENEU WE'RE ALL BACK ON THURSDAY GET LUNCH AND CLEAN YOUR ACCOUTREMENTS DICK SHOWED BESSIE THE LETTER AND SHE ABUSED HIM FOR THAT HE HAD EVER SENT TORPENHOW AWAY AND RUINED HER LIFE
BUT DICK FELL INTO STEP AT HER SIDE AND THE TWO PACED THE EMBANKMENT TOGETHER KEEPING THE STEP
TORPENHOW LAUGHED AS HE ENTERED
SHE HAD DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND WAS SOBBING WITH HER FACE HIDDEN IN HER HANDS I CAN'T I CAN'T SHE CRIED DESPERATELY INDEED I CAN'T IT ISN'T MY FAULT
YOU HAD THREE HUNDRED A YEAR I HAVE THAT STILL I AM PAINTING THAT'S ALL ARE YOU ALONE THEN THERE'S A GIRL LIVING WITH ME DON'T WALK SO FAST DICK
IF THERE IS A WAY I MUSTN'T INTERFERE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CHANCES BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND I WANT TO BE ALONE I WANT TO BE ALONE WHAT A ROW THEY'RE MAKING
HE'S INTENSELY SUSPICIOUS AND UTTERLY LAWLESS MATTER OF TEMPER SAID THE NILGHAI IT'S THE SAME WITH HORSES SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY WORK
BUT HE NEVER SEEMED TO DO MUCH EXCEPT FUDGE HIS REPORTS FROM THE NILGHAI SEE DEAR OLD NILGHAI HE'S IN TOWN FATTER THAN EVER HE OUGHT TO BE UP HERE THIS EVENING I SEE THE COMPARISON PERFECTLY
WITH A POLICEMAN AT EACH CORNER SAY THAT I CHARGE TOO MUCH FOR MY PICTURES THEY ARE BUYING YOUR WORK NOT YOUR INSURANCE POLICIES DEAR CHILD SAID THE NILGHAI I GAMBLED WITH ONE TO GET AT THE OTHER DON'T PREACH GO ON WITH THE PILOT
BINKIE WENT TO HIS OWN CHAIR AND AS OFTEN AS HE LOOKED SAW DICK WALKING UP AND DOWN RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING THAT NIGHT DICK WROTE A LETTER TO MAISIE FULL OF THE TENDEREST REGARD FOR HER HEALTH BUT SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIS OWN
COME HERE DICK COUGHED HUSKILY WONDERING INDEED WHAT HE SHOULD SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT TEMPERATELY WHAT'S THE NEED FOR SAYING ANYTHING GET UP AND TRAMP
NEW FOR ME SENSIBLE PEOPLE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IT FOR YEARS YOU AND I AND THE WILCOXES STAND UPON MONEY AS UPON ISLANDS IT IS SO FIRM BENEATH OUR FEET THAT WE FORGET ITS VERY EXISTENCE
OR THAT TIBBY WAS NOT INTERESTED IN CURRANT PLANTATIONS HE NEVER NOTICED THE LIGHTS AND SHADES THAT EXIST IN THE GRAYEST CONVERSATION THE FINGER POSTS THE MILESTONES THE COLLISIONS THE ILLIMITABLE VIEWS
MARGARET LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE BUTLER HE AS A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WAS FAINTLY ATTRACTIVE TO HER AS A WOMAN AN ATTRACTION SO FAINT AS SCARCELY TO BE PERCEPTIBLE
CHARLES TOOK HIM OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND THEY PACED UP AND DOWN IN THEIR DRESSING GOWNS CHARLES BECAME VERY QUIET AS THE STORY UNROLLED HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT MARGARET WAS AS BAD AS HER SISTER
I'M NO FATALIST HEAVEN FORBID BUT OUR CIVILIZATION IS MOULDED BY GREAT IMPERSONAL FORCES HIS VOICE GREW COMPLACENT IT ALWAYS DID WHEN HE ELIMINATED THE PERSONAL
VOID OF EMOTION AND SCARCELY HALLOWED BY THE MEMORIES OF THIRTY YEARS OF HAPPINESS THROUGH ITS ROUND TOPPED DOORWAY PASSED FURNITURE AND PICTURES AND BOOKS UNTIL THE LAST ROOM WAS GUTTED AND THE LAST VAN HAD RUMBLED AWAY
FOR WHICH HE WAS HEARTILY SORRY AND HE COULD NOT SEE THAT THOSE OATS ARE OF A DARKER STOCK WHICH ARE ROOTED IN ANOTHER'S DISHONOUR UNCHASTITY AND INFIDELITY WERE AS CONFUSED TO HIM AS TO THE MIDDLE AGES HIS ONLY MORAL TEACHER
OH THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT I'LL SPEAK TO HER THIS VISIT IS A HIGH SOLEMNITY MY AUNT COUNTS ON IT YEAR AFTER YEAR SHE TURNS THE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR US SHE INVITES OUR SPECIAL FRIENDS SHE SCARCELY KNOWS FRIEDA AND WE CAN'T LEAVE HER ON HER HANDS
HELEN YOU MUST TELL ME WHETHER THIS THING WORRIES YOU IF WHAT SAID HELEN WHO WAS WASHING HER HANDS FOR LUNCH
WITH THE PASSION WITHOUT IT WE ARE MEANINGLESS FRAGMENTS HALF MONKS HALF BEASTS UNCONNECTED ARCHES THAT HAVE NEVER JOINED INTO A MAN WITH IT LOVE IS BORN
MAKING MONEY A SPHERE AWAITING YOU AND SO ON ALL OF WHICH ARE FOR VARIOUS REASONS CANT SHE SEWED ON I'M ONLY YOUR SISTER I HAVEN'T ANY AUTHORITY OVER YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY JUST TO PUT BEFORE YOU
WHAT TO DO WHY TO INQUIRE HE SWAGGERED UP TO IT TRAGICALLY AND SOUNDED A PEAL MARGARET POURED HERSELF OUT SOME COFFEE THE BUTLER CAME AND SAID THAT MISS SCHLEGEL HAD SLEPT AT THE GEORGE SO FAR AS HE HAD HEARD
BY QUIET INDICATIONS THE BRIDGE WOULD BE BUILT AND SPAN THEIR LIVES WITH BEAUTY BUT
SHE COULD EVEN SEE THE BATHING SHED BUT WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR CHARLES'S NEW SPRINGBOARD THE FOREHEAD OF THE HILL ROSE UP AND HID THE WHOLE SCENE SHE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN DAY AND NIGHT THE RIVER FLOWS DOWN INTO ENGLAND
SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR PLANS IT'S AS WELL TO BE PREPARED NO IT'S AS WELL NOT TO BE PREPARED
HERE WAS MARGARET WHO BEHAVED AS IF HE HAD NOT THERE THE HOUSE ROUND THEM WERE HALF A DOZEN GARDENERS CLEARING UP AFTER HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING ALL WAS SO SOLID AND SPRUCE THAT THE PAST FLEW UP OUT OF SIGHT LIKE A SPRING BLIND
A MAN WHO HAD LITTLE MONEY SHE REPEATED HAS LESS OWING TO US UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I DO NOT CONSIDER THE BATTLE OF LIFE A HAPPY EXPRESSION OH COME COME HE PROTESTED PLEASANTLY
NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
STEAMING ALL NIGHT LIKE A KETTLE FEEL THE CELLAR WALLS LOOK UP UNDER THE EAVES ASK SIR JAMES OR ANYONE THOSE SHROPSHIRE VALLEYS ARE NOTORIOUS THE ONLY POSSIBLE PLACE FOR A HOUSE IN SHROPSHIRE IS ON A HILL
EXCLAIMING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOR A BASEMENT YOU'LL NEVER GET IT AND THEY WOULD ANSWER ONE CAN BUT TRY MADAM THE PASSENGER LIFTS THE PROVISION LIFTS
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE HENRY DEAR WAS HER GREETING HE HAD FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST AND WAS BEGINNING THE TIMES HIS SISTER IN LAW WAS PACKING SHE KNELT BY HIM AND TOOK THE PAPER FROM HIM FEELING THAT IT WAS UNUSUALLY HEAVY AND THICK
THAT WAS WHAT I FELT AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS NO NEED TO TROUBLE ABOUT THE MAN HE WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF HEART DISEASE AND JUST BEFORE I COULD SHOW HIM WHAT I THOUGHT OF HIM HE WENT OFF THE POLICE ARE SEEING ABOUT IT AT THIS MOMENT
AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF POLITE BEWILDERMENT HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE HER KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURE SLIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEW ENGLISH ART CLUB
SHORTLY BEFORE THE MOVE OUR HERO AND HEROINE WERE MARRIED
BUT HE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE MEN
HELEN CANNOT DECEIVE ME SHE DOES MIND OH HUSH BREATHED MARGARET FRIEDA'LL HEAR YOU AND SHE CAN BE SO TIRESOME SHE MINDS PERSISTED MISSUS MUNT
SHE HAD A FACE LIKE A SILKWORM AND THE DINING ROOM REEKS OF ORRIS ROOT WE CHATTED PLEASANTLY A LITTLE ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I WONDERED WHERE HERS WAS TOO AND ADVISED HER TO GO TO THE POLICE SHE THANKED ME
AND WHO WOULD AN ELDERLY MAN WITH A MOUSTACHE AND A COPPER COLOURED FACE BE MISTER WILCOX POSSIBLY I KNEW IT AND THERE'S MISTER WILCOX
THOUGH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNSELFISHNESS LITTLE AS MY THANKS ARE WORTH DIDN'T SHE SEND ME A MESSAGE OR ANYTHING I HEARD OF NONE
IT'S A GOOD HALF MILE SAID CHARLES STEPPING INTO THE GARDEN THE SUN'S VERY HOT FOR APRIL
THE BASTS KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT AND MIGHT FIND IT PROFITABLE TO HINT AS MUCH AT ALL EVENTS YOU MUSTN'T WORRY HE SAID THIS IS A MAN'S BUSINESS HE THOUGHT INTENTLY ON NO ACCOUNT MENTION IT TO ANYBODY
AND STAMPED WITH A HUMAN FACE LONDON IS RELIGION'S OPPORTUNITY NOT THE DECOROUS RELIGION OF THEOLOGIANS BUT ANTHROPOMORPHIC CRUDE YES THE CONTINUOUS FLOW WOULD BE TOLERABLE IF A MAN OF OUR OWN SORT
I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS TO LIVE THERE I WON'T HAVE IT HE LOOKED ANGRILY AT THE MOON TO MY MIND THIS QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY ITSELF
YOUR LAST SPEECH INTERESTED ME SO MUCH GENERALLY PEOPLE DO NOT
BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTED ME UP TO THE LAST BAGS I WRITING TO AUNT JULEY ABOUT THIS NOW MEG REMEMBER BAGS I BAG IT BY ALL MEANS
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
AND VERY COMMON HE LOOKED IN A TALL HAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIS BACK WAS TURNED TO HER AND THOUGH SHE HAD CUT HIS BACK SHE COULD NOT REGARD THIS AS A TELLING SNUB BUT YOU WILL BE CAREFUL WON'T YOU SHE EXHORTED
I SAY HOW CAN YOU GUESS THE TEMPTATIONS THAT LIE ROUND A MAN IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US SAID MARGARET BUT IF WE ARE WORTH MARRYING WE DO GUESS
RETAINING HER SISTER'S IN THE OTHER
I THINK I'LL GO ROUND TO THE POLICE STATION SAID HIS FATHER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER WHAT FOR CRIED DOLLY WHO HAD STILL NOT BEEN TOLD VERY WELL SIR WHICH CAR WILL YOU HAVE I THINK I'LL WALK
IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
OUT TO HIS DUTY DUTY ALWAYS ELICITED A GROAN HE DOESN'T WANT THE MONEY IT IS WORK HE WANTS THOUGH IT IS BEASTLY WORK DULL COUNTRY DISHONEST NATIVES AN ETERNAL FIDGET OVER FRESH WATER AND FOOD
THE ARRANGEMENT FOR COALS A GREAT TEMPTATION FOR A DISHONEST PORTER WERE ALL FAMILIAR MATTERS TO HER AND PERHAPS A RELIEF FROM THE POLITICO ECONOMICAL AESTHETIC ATMOSPHERE THAT REIGNED AT THE SCHLEGELS
FOR WHICH SHE WAS NEVER PREPARED HOWEVER MUCH SHE REMINDED HERSELF OF IT HIS OBTUSENESS HE SIMPLY DID NOT NOTICE THINGS AND THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE NEVER NOTICED THAT HELEN AND FRIEDA WERE HOSTILE
RELIGION HAD CONFIRMED HIM
AND HE DIED THE MAN'S NAME EXCLAIMED JOAM GARRAL IN A TONE HE COULD NOT CONTROL YOU WILL KNOW IT WHEN I AM ONE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE WRITING
AT DAYBREAK ON THE MORROW THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JUNE THE CABLES WERE CAST OFF AND THE RAFT CONTINUED ITS JOURNEY DOWN THE RIVER AN EXTRA PASSENGER WAS ON BOARD WHENCE CAME THIS TORRES NO ONE EXACTLY KNEW WHERE WAS HE GOING TO
THE GIRL AROSE ASHY PALE AS IF SHE WOULD SEEK SHELTER BY THE SIDE OF HER MOTHER YAQUITA OPENED HER ARMS TO PROTECT TO DEFEND HER FATHER SAID BENITO
AND CROWDED ROUND FRAGOSO WHO WAS INSTALLED IN A LOJA OF THE PLACE A SORT OF SERVING BAR TO THE INN
AT TABATINGA AND THERE HE IS AS IF HE WAS WAITING FOR US THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THESE MEETINGS WERE IN PURSUANCE OF A PRECONCEIVED PLAN WHEN I SEE THE SHIFTY DOGGED LOOK OF TORRES ALL THIS CROWDS ON MY MIND I DO NOT KNOW
WHICH OBSTRUCTED IT BEFORE TAKING TO THE SAW AND THE AX THEY HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH A FELLING SWORD THAT INDISPENSABLE TOOL OF EVERY ONE WHO DESIRES TO PENETRATE THE AMAZONIAN FORESTS A LARGE BLADE SLIGHTLY CURVED WIDE AND FLAT AND TWO OR THREE FEET LONG
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND MEANS OF SAFE AND RAPID TRANSIT BOATS DID NOT PLY REGULARLY AND IN MOST CASES THE TRAVELER WAS OBLIGED TO WALK ACROSS THE FORESTS THIS IS WHAT TORRES HAD DONE AND WHAT HE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE DONE
BETWEEN THE TWO MEN FOR A MOMENT ALONE IN THE ROOM WHERE NONE COULD SEE OR HEAR THEM
AND LEAVE THE JANGADA AT THIS VERY INSTANT YES THIS INSTANT EXCLAIMED BENITO OR I WILL THROW YOU OVERBOARD TORRES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS NO THREATS HE SAID
LOOK HERE LOOK HERE SAID HE HOW WILL THAT DO MY FRIENDS IF YOU DON'T SLEEP ON THE TOP OF IT
BUT WE OUGHT TO SAY THAT LIKE THEIR PREDECESSORS
YOU ARE JOAM DACOSTA CONTINUED TORRES
A DOSE OF BUCKSHOT TO THE HEAD CLOSE TO THE EYE FROM BENITO STOPPED ONE OF THE MONSTERS
IF ARAUJO HAD NO MAP TO GUIDE HIM HIS EXPERIENCE SERVED HIM MORE SURELY AND IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM UNRAVELING THE CHAOS WITHOUT EVER TURNING ASIDE FROM THE MAIN RIVER IN FACT HE DID SO WELL THAT ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JULY IN THE AFTERNOON
AND WHICH IN CALM WEATHER WERE ROWED BY FOUR LONG PADDLES
THE GUESTS OF THE FAZENDER TOOK LEAVE OF THE GARRAL FAMILY TOWARD THE EVENING
AND TRANSFERRED TO TABATINGA IT CAN THUS BE CALLED A GARRISON TOWN BUT THE GARRISON IS ONLY COMPOSED OF NINE SOLDIERS NEARLY ALL INDIANS AND A SERGEANT WHO IS THE ACTUAL COMMANDANT OF THE PLACE A BANK ABOUT THIRTY FEET HIGH IN WHICH ARE CUT THE STEPS OF A NOT VERY SOLID STAIRCASE
UNDER THE INVIGORATING INFLUENCES OF FORESTS FIELDS AND RUNNING WATERS MOREOVER THE FEW WEEKS THAT WERE TO PRECEDE HIS DEPARTURE HAD BEEN WELL EMPLOYED AT THIS PERIOD AS WE HAVE JUST REMARKED THE COURSE OF THE AMAZON WAS NOT YET FURROWED BY THE NUMBERLESS STEAM VESSELS
BUT RATHER FOND OF DRINK SUCH AS HE WAS
PADRE PASSANHA BENITO LINA FRAGOSO CYBELE AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS INDIAN OR NEGRO OF THE FAZENDA FRAGOSO COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF STILL HE WENT AND HE CAME HE RAN DOWN THE BANK AND RAN UP THE PLATEAU
SO DO NOT INSIST OH DO NOT BE ALARMED EXCLAIMED FRAGOSO I AM NOT GOING TO PAY IT OFF LET ME ADD THAT YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD THE JANGADA AND GAVE ME THE MEANS OF DESCENDING THE RIVER BUT HERE WE ARE ON THE SOIL OF BRAZIL WHICH ACCORDING TO ALL PROBABILITY I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE SEEN AGAIN WITHOUT THAT LIANA
BUT THE USE TO WHICH HE COULD PUT HIS COMB AND THE TONGS WHICH WERE KEPT WARMING IN THE CORNER IN A BRASIER
PIMAICAIRA CATURIA CHICO MOTACHINA
A LITTLE ABOVE TABATINGA AND THERE ESTABLISHING A POST THIS AFFORDED THE SOLUTION AND FROM THAT TIME THE FRONTIER OF THE TWO COUNTRIES PASSED THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS ISLAND ABOVE THE RIVER IS PERUVIAN
THAT THE FELLING OF THIS HALF MILE OF FOREST WOULD SCARCELY LEAVE AN APPRECIABLE VOID
AND BOMBAX OF SUPERB STATURE WITH ITS STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH WHITE STEM AMONG THESE MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS OF THE AMAZONIAN FLORA THERE FELL MANY QUATIBOS WHOSE ROSY CANOPIES TOWERED ABOVE THE NEIGHBORING TREES WHOSE FRUITS ARE LIKE LITTLE CUPS WITH ROWS OF CHESTNUTS RANGED WITHIN
AND THEN MEN AND WOMEN WITH EQUAL EAGERNESS TOOK THEIR PLACES ON THE BARBER'S STOOL THE SCISSORS OF FRAGOSO HAD LITTLE TO DO
WHOSE HEAD EXPANDS IN A BOUQUET OF VEGETABLE FIREWORKS MADE UP OF THE YELLOW PURPLE AND SNOWY WHITE OF THE PARASITIC PLANTS THREE WEEKS AFTER THE WORK WAS BEGUN NOT ONE WAS STANDING OF ALL THE TREES WHICH HAD COVERED THE ANGLE OF THE AMAZON AND THE NANAY THE CLEARANCE WAS COMPLETE
THE SERVICE WAS WORKED BY INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT ALONE AND OFTEN THE BOATS WERE ONLY EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS OF THE RIVERSIDE ESTABLISHMENTS
WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEPARTURE THOUGH THE OLD NEGRESS COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANTED TO GO OR WHAT THEY HOPED TO SEE
WHOM THEY SOUGHT FOR THIS DIAMOND AFFAIR WHOM THEY CONVICTED OF CRIME AND SENTENCED TO DEATH AND IT WAS YOU WHO ESCAPED FROM THE PRISON AT VILLA RICA A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED DO YOU NOT ANSWER
JOAM GARRAL WAS READY TO THROW HIMSELF ON TORRES TO SEARCH HIM TO SNATCH FROM HIM THE PROOFS OF HIS INNOCENCE THE WRITING IS IN A SAFE PLACE REPLIED TORRES AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT UNTIL YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BECOME MY WIFE
WHICH BRINGS ITS MAGNIFICENT BLACK WATERS FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND DISCHARGES THEM INTO THE MAIN ARTERY BY A MOUTH OF FOUR HUNDRED METERS IN EXTENT AFTER HAVING WATERED THE TERRITORIES OF THE CULINO INDIANS A NUMBER OF ISLANDS WERE BREASTED
WHICH IS ITSELF AN AFFLUENT OF THE AMAZON A PECULIAR PHENOMENON FOR THE RIVER DISPLACES ITSELF TO FEED ITS OWN TRIBUTARIES TOWARD THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE GIANT RAFT PASSED THE MOUTH
IT WAS IN THIS JANGADA SAFER THAN ANY OTHER VESSEL OF THE COUNTRY LARGER THAN A HUNDRED EGARITEAS OR VIGILINGAS COUPLED TOGETHER THAT JOAM GARRAL PROPOSED TO EMBARK WITH HIS FAMILY HIS SERVANTS AND HIS MERCHANDISE EXCELLENT IDEA HAD CRIED MINHA
EVEN IN THE FORM OF TAPIOCA ACCORDING TO THE FANCY OF THE NATIVES ON BOARD THE JANGADA THERE WAS A HUGE PILE OF THIS USEFUL PRODUCT DESTINED FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AS FOR PRESERVED MEATS NOT FORGETTING A WHOLE FLOCK OF SHEEP
HE RETIRED TO HIS ROOM WITH HIM
WHAT CONNECTION CAN POSSIBLY EXIST BETWEEN YOUR FATHER AND THIS ADVENTURER EVIDENTLY YOUR FATHER HAS NEVER SEEN HIM I DO NOT SAY THAT MY FATHER KNOWS TORRES SAID BENITO BUT ASSUREDLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TORRES KNOWS MY FATHER
IT IS OF THIS HAND THAT THE TRAVELER EMILE CARREY HAS SO JUSTLY OBSERVED THE TIGER HIMSELF WOULD PERISH IN ITS GRASP
HIS FACE GLOWED WITH GENEROUS RESOLUTION GOING UP TO YAQUITA HE SAID MY MOTHER TO MINHA HE SAID MY WIFE AND TO BENITO HE SAID MY BROTHER AND TURNING TOWARD LINA AND FRAGOSO
THE NIGHT PASSED AT THE MOORINGS NEAR A SLIGHTLY RISING SHORE AND NOTHING DISTURBED THE QUIET
FROM ONE BANK TO ANOTHER ITS WIDTH IS ABOUT TWO LEAGUES
WHO WOULD FOR VERY GOOD REASONS HAVE PREFERRED SOME RAPID STEAMBOAT BUT THOUGH THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT DEVISED BY JOAM WERE PRIMITIVE IN THE EXTREME HE WAS GOING TO TAKE WITH HIM A NUMEROUS FOLLOWING AND ABANDON HIMSELF TO THE STREAM UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS OF COMFORT AND SECURITY
IT IS TO DAY THE LARGEST STATE OF SOUTH AMERICA AND HAS AT ITS HEAD THE INTELLIGENT ARTIST KING DOM PEDRO
BUT AN EARLIER LAYING HAD TAKEN PLACE TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE EGGS HAD HATCHED UNDER THE ACTION OF THE HEAT STORED IN THE SAND AND ALREADY SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF LITTLE TURTLES WERE RUNNING ABOUT THE BEACH THE HUNTERS WERE THEREFORE IN LUCK
IT HAS BEEN THE COUNTRY OF THE OMAGUAS WHOSE NAME MEANS FLAT HEADS AND IS DERIVED FROM THE BARBAROUS CUSTOM OF THE NATIVE MOTHERS OF SQUEEZING THE HEADS OF THEIR NEWBORN CHILDREN BETWEEN TWO PLATES SO AS TO GIVE THEM AN OBLONG SKULL
SOME OF EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS HOPED WOULD FIGURE IN TURN ON THE TABLES OF THE MASTER AND HIS MEN AND SO EACH DAY SHOOTING AND FISHING WERE TO BE REGULARLY INDULGED IN FOR BEVERAGES THEY HAD A GOOD STORE OF THE BEST THAT COUNTRY PRODUCED CAYSUMA OR
AND WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD ME OUT YOU WILL SEE IF YOU DARE REFUSE ME YOUR DAUGHTER I AM LISTENING TORRES WELL SAID THE ADVENTURER HALF KEEPING BACK HIS WORDS AS IF HE WAS SORRY TO LET THEM ESCAPE FROM HIS LIPS
IT IS THUS ONCE MORE TORRES SAID JOAM GARRAL YOU ARE A CONSUMMATE SCOUNDREL BE IT SO
BELOW THE WOUND SMALL POTS ARE ATTACHED WHICH TWENTY FOUR HOURS SUFFICE TO FILL WITH A MILKY SAP IT CAN ALSO BE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF A HOLLOW BAMBOO AND A RECEPTACLE PLACED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE
ONLY WHEN THE RAFT WAS MADE UP HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE TO BENITO
HE HAD SO COMMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE OFFER MUST NOW BE MADE HE DID NOT SPECIALLY REGRET THAT THOUGH HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN MORE RETICENT WHAT A FOOL A MAN IS TO BLURT OUT EVERYTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF A WIFE WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
LOOK HERE MAJOR TIFTO YOU HAVE COME HERE TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT INJURY YES I HAVE AND YOU SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR IT INDEED I AM AND I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU
IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN I WILL WALK WITH YOU SILVERBRIDGE OF COURSE HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEY STARTED TOGETHER
HOW MUCH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR FRANK AND THEN WHAT A WIFE I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM I THINK YOU WOULD HE'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER HALF SO GOOD AND HE'LL BE SURE TO GET ONE BEFORE LONG
WE WAS VERY MUCH TOGETHER AT ONE TIME MY LORD YES MAJOR TIFTO WE WERE OF COURSE I WAS A VILLAIN BUT IT WAS ONLY ONCE AND YOUR LORDSHIP WAS SO ROUGH TO ME I AM NOT SAYING BUT WHAT I WAS A VILLAIN
AND EVERYBODY KNEW AS YOUR LORDSHIP AND ME WAS TOGETHER IN HIM THEN HE BURST OUT INTO A PAROXYSM OF TEARS AND SOBBING THE YOUNG LORD CERTAINLY COULD NOT TAKE THE MAN INTO PARTNERSHIP AGAIN
WITH ALL MY HEART I DO THEN I AM AS PROUD AS A QUEEN
AND EXPLAINING HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHILE HE WAS A MEMBER OF ONE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT HIS SON SHOULD BE SITTING AS A MEMBER OF ANOTHER HOW IT WAS THAT A NOBLEMAN COULD BE A COMMONER AND HOW A PEER OF ONE PART OF THE EMPIRE
VARIEGATED IN SOME MATTERS BY SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS AMBITIOUS OF BECOMING HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW WHILE HE WAS OPENING OUT TO HER THE MYSTERIES OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT WISH TO INTRODUCE HIS FRIEND TO HIS FATHER THE DUKE SAW IT ALL AT A GLANCE AND FELT THAT THE INTRODUCTION SHOULD BE MADE PERHAPS SAID HE GETTING UP FROM HIS CHAIR
LADY MABEL'S PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO IT IF HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ALONE TOGETHER OR COMPARATIVELY ALONE HE MUST BE PREPARED FOR AN OPPOSITION AT ANY RATE OF SOME DAYS
ONE AS TO THE SLANG AND ANOTHER AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF TEACHING SOMETHING TO THE POOR VOTERS ON SUCH OCCASIONS OUR ONLY COMFORT WAS THAT THE CARBOTTLE PEOPLE WERE QUITE AS BADLY OFF AS US
SHALL I GO TO HEAVEN FOR DOING THAT I DON'T KNOW SAID MISS CASSEWARY WHO WAS SO MUCH PERTURBED BY THE NEWS SHE HAD HEARD AS TO BE UNABLE TO COME TO ANY OPINION ON THE POINT JUST RAISED OR MAYN'T I RATHER GO TO THE OTHER PLACE
AND THAT ALL DID HAVE TAILS TILL THEY WERE ILL USED IS THE EXTENT OF MY STABLE KNOWLEDGE VERY GOOD INDEED MY LORD DUKE VERY GOOD INDEED HA HA HA ALL HORSES HAVE HEADS AND ALL HAVE TAILS HEADS AND TAILS
ISABEL WOULD NOT TAKE THE PRIZE WITHOUT THE DUKE'S CONSENT AND MABEL COULD NOT HAVE IT WITHOUT THAT OTHER CONSENT
THEN HE CONSIDERED WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT POSSIBLY MAKE SOME BARGAIN WITH HIS FATHER HOW WOULD IT BE IF HE SHOULD CONSENT TO GO BACK TO THE LIBERAL PARTY ON BEING ALLOWED TO MARRY THE GIRL HE LOVED AS FAR AS HIS POLITICAL FEELINGS WERE CONCERNED
THERE WERE NINE DAYS OF THIS WORK DURING WHICH LORD SILVERBRIDGE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND MADE MANY SPEECHES TREGEAR DID NOT WIN HALF SO MANY HEARTS OR RECOMMEND HIMSELF SO THOROUGHLY TO THE POLITICAL PREDILECTIONS OF THE BOROUGH
THIS PUT HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN YOUR BED TILL IT'S OUT I DID THAT THING THAT THEY SAID I DID WHAT THING WHY THE NAIL IT WAS I LAMED THE HORSE
BUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IT HAD ALL COME OUT NOW AT ANY RATE IT WAS DECIDED FOR HIM THAT HE MUST IN SET TERMS ASK HER TO BE HIS WIFE THE SCENE WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED HAD MADE HIM THOROUGHLY SICK OF MAJOR TIFTO
THIS IS MAJOR TIFTO YES MY LORD DUKE I AM MAJOR TIFTO THE DUKE BOWED GRACIOUSLY MY FATHER AND I WERE ENGAGED ABOUT PRIVATE MATTERS SAID SILVERBRIDGE I BEG TEN THOUSAND PARDONS EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR
BUT STILL IT SEEMED HARD TO HIM THAT THIS INTENTION OF MARRIAGE SHOULD STAND IN HIS WAY OF HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MISS BONCASSEN FOR A FEW WEEKS NO DOUBT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO MARRIAGE IT CLIPPED A FELLOW'S WINGS BUT THEN IF HE WERE MARRIED
FOR IF THIS ALL COMES ROUND I SHALL VERY SOON BE ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS LORD SILVERBRIDGE
HIS SISTER WAS AT MATCHING WITH A HOUSEFUL OF OTHER PALLISERS AND HIS FATHER WAS AGAIN DEEP IN POLITICS OF COURSE HE WAS MUCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT THAT ALSO WAS STUPID INDEED EVERYTHING WOULD BE STUPID TILL ISABEL CAME BACK
BUT AS HE DID SO HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE COULD BE NO LONGER A HOME FOR HIM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ISABEL WAS TO INHABIT AS THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN GRADUALLY HOWEVER BETTER THOUGHTS RETURNED TO HIM AFTER ALL WHAT WAS SHE BUT A PERT POPPET
I WISH WE COULD START THIS INSTANT BUT WE CAN'T CAN WE NO DEAR SO MANY THINGS HAVE TO BE SETTLED AND WHAT HAVE YOU SETTLED ON SINCE YOU LAST SPOKE TO ME I HAVE TOLD YOUR FATHER EVERYTHING
IT WAS HE WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN EFFICACIOUS IN EVERY ATTEMPT THEY HAD MADE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY THEY HAD BEEN LOOKED INTO AND CIRCUMVENTED AS MISTER CARBOTTLE HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO POLPENNO ON PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT SPEND MONEY
BUT HE SELECTED TWO FOR HIS PECULIAR NOTICE AND THOSE TWO WERE MISS BONCASSEN AND LADY MABEL WHILE HE WOULD HIMSELF WALK AND TALK AND ARGUE AFTER HIS OWN PECULIAR FASHION WITH THE AMERICAN BEAUTY
LADY CANTRIP WROTE HOW COULD IT BE AN ACCIDENT YOU HAD MARY UP IN TOWN ON FRIDAY
WHEN I COME UP TO YOUR BEDROOM THAT MORNING I REMEMBER IT THE FIRST TIME YES I REMEMBER IT BECAUSE I CAME TWICE MY LORD WHEN I CAME FIRST IT HADN'T BEEN DONE
TIFTO YES TIFTO
AND NOTHING IS TO BE DONE TO GREEN I SHOULD SAY NOTHING ON THAT SCORE AND HE HAS GOT THEY SAY FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS CLEAR MONEY
WHICH ALSO GAVE RISE TO SOME MENTAL MEMORANDA IT WAS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR MABEL I AM A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS
HE HAD TO READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH TWICE BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE DID READ IT TWICE AND THEN FOLDING THE LETTER VERY SLOWLY GAVE IT BACK TO HIS COMPANION WHAT OUGHT I TO DO ASKED LADY MABEL
BUT MISS CASSEWARY WAS QUITE SATISFIED TO BE ALLOWED TO GO TO BED IN LIEU OF MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES'S GREAT BALL
SAW THEM PASS THROUGH A LITTLE GATE WHICH LED FROM THE GARDENS INTO THE PRIORY RUINS IT ALL MEANS NOTHING MABEL SAID WITH A LITTLE LAUGH TO HER COMPANION IF SO I AM SORRY FOR THE YOUNG LADY SAID MISSUS FINN
MASTER OF HOUNDS MEMBER OF THE CLUB
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT AS YET REALLY THIS TAKES ME QUITE BY SURPRISE I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH THOUGHT TO THE MATTER I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS SAID LORD SILVERBRIDGE
THERE WAS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE REACTION BUT THE ELECTIONEERING GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND IN THE HUMBLE RETIREMENT OF HIS OWN HOME HE WAS A TAILOR IN THE TOWN
AS YOU AND I MY DEAR ARE FRIENDS I THINK THAT ANY CARRYING OF A MESSAGE TO MARY WOULD BE BREAKING CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO MARY ABOUT MISTER TREGEAR THEN HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
WELL THEN HIS SERENE HIGHNESS THE HEIR OF THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAS DONE ME THE INEXPRESSIBLE HONOUR OF ASKING ME TO MARRY HIM NO YOU MAY WELL SAY NO AND TO TELL THE TRUTH EXACTLY HE DIDN'T
YES THAT IS WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY IS SHE AWARE OF YOUR INTENTION QUITE AWARE I BELIEVE I MAY SAY THAT IF OTHER THINGS GO STRAIGHT SHE WILL CONSENT AND YOUR FATHER THE DUKE
THERE IS THE DUKE HIMSELF I NEVER SAW A MAN MORE ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE BUT I DO NOT WANT TO MARRY AN ENGLISH DUKE SAID ISABEL AND I PITY ANY GIRL WHO HAS ANY IDEA OF MARRIAGE
I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BEFORE BUT AS HE WAS THERE I HAD TO SHOW THAT I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF HIM
IT IS A PITY BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED I WILL HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH IT OF COURSE I CANNOT BIND YOU BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU MY WISHES THE POOR WRETCH WAS SILENT BUT STILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE DID NOT WISH TO GO QUITE YET
SOMETHING IN MISS CELIA'S VOICE AS SHE SAID THE LAST TWO WORDS WITH HER HAND ON BEN'S SHOULDER MADE HIM LOOK UP QUICKLY AND TURN RED WITH PLEASURE WONDERING WHAT THE SQUIRE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT HIM MOTHER MUST HAVE SOME OF THE PARTY
AND THANKED HER BY LAYING HIS CHEEK AGAINST THE PRETTY SLIPPER THAT RESTED ON THE STEP BESIDE HIM AS IF HE HAD NO WORDS IN WHICH TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO THE GENTLE MISTRESS WHOM HE MEANT HENCEFORTH TO SERVE WITH GRATEFUL FIDELITY

BEN RUMMAGED OUT THE NOTE WITH REMORSEFUL HASTE PROTESTING THAT HE WAS IN NO HURRY FOR MISTER GULLIVER AND VERY GLAD TO SAVE HIM FOR ANOTHER DAY LEAVING THE YOUNG FOLKS BUSY WITH THEIR GAMES MISS CELIA SAT IN THE PORCH TO READ HER LETTERS FOR THERE WERE TWO
DON'T FORGET DAY AND DATE H FROST MANAGER WHILE SAM READ THE OTHER BOYS HAD BEEN GLOATING OVER THE ENTICING PICTURES WHICH COVERED THE BILL THERE WAS THE GOLDEN CAR
AND WE DON'T WANT TO WALK FAST BEN SPOKE VERY DECIDEDLY AND TAKING BILLY'S ARM AWAY THEY WENT LEAVING POOR BAB AND SANCH TO WATCH THEM OUT OF SIGHT ONE SOBBING THE OTHER WHINING DISMALLY

GROWLED SAM KITTERIDGE BITTERLY RESENTING THE STERN EDICT WHICH FORBADE FREE BORN CITIZENS TO BURN AS MUCH GUNPOWDER AS THEY LIKED ON THAT GLORIOUS DAY LAST YEAR JIMMY GOT HIS ARM BLOWN OFF WHEN THEY FIRED THE OLD CANNON
SEEMING TO SOOTHE HIS PAIN AS THEY FELL WHILE THE SENSE OF LONELINESS PASSED AWAY AND IT GREW POSSIBLE TO WAIT TILL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO FATHER IN THAT FAR OFF COUNTRY LOVELIER THAN GOLDEN CALIFORNIA

AND I'M GOING TO BE HER BOY AND STAY HERE ALL THE TIME I GUESS THE LETTER I BROUGHT WAS A RECOMMEND FROM THE SQUIRE YES BEN AND IF I HAD NOT ALREADY MADE UP MY MIND TO KEEP YOU BEFORE I CERTAINLY WOULD NOW MY BOY
THAT NOW IS SOMETHING LIKE AND BEN WHO HAD PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THE WORD CIRCUS LAID HIS FINGER ON A SMALLER CUT OF A MAN HANGING BY THE BACK OF HIS NECK WITH A CHILD IN EACH HAND TWO MEN SUSPENDED FROM HIS FEET
SANCHO LAPPED EAGERLY WITH HIS EYES SHUT ALL HIS RUFFLES WERE GRAY WITH DUST AND HIS TAIL HUNG WEARILY DOWN THE TASSEL AT HALF MAST AS IF IN MOURNING FOR THE MASTER WHOM HE HAD COME TO FIND
HASN'T GOT ANY MONEY MORE LIKELY OBSERVED A SHABBY YOUTH WHOSE POCKETS NEVER HAD ANY THING IN THEM BUT A PAIR OF DIRTY HANDS BEN CALMLY PRODUCED A DOLLAR BILL AND WAVED IT DEFIANTLY BEFORE THIS DOUBTER
WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
ANSWERED SAM PRODUCING HALF A DOLLAR AS IF SUCH MAGNIFICENT SUMS WERE NO STRANGERS TO HIS POCKET COME ON BROWN YOU'LL BE A FIRST RATE FELLOW TO SHOW US ROUND AS YOU KNOW ALL THE DODGES SAID BILLY
CHAPTER THIRTEEN SOMEBODY RUNS AWAY SCHOOL IS DONE NOW WE'LL HAVE FUN SUNG BAB AND BETTY
AND GETTING A SMART RAP ACROSS THE NOSE AS HE FAILED TO PERFORM THE FEAT MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT OLD CHAP IT'S HARD WORK I CAN TELL YOU AND THAT WOULDN'T SUIT SUCH A LAZY BONES THEN YOU ARE TOO BIG TO BEGIN
NO ONE SAW HOW PITIFULLY HER EYES RESTED ON BEN'S HAPPY FACE WHEN THE LETTERS WERE PUT AWAY AND NO ONE MINDED THE NEW GENTLENESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE
NO ONE SAW HOW PITIFULLY HER EYES RESTED ON BEN'S HAPPY FACE WHEN THE LETTERS WERE PUT AWAY AND NO ONE MINDED THE NEW GENTLENESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE
OF BEN BROWN THE ELDER'S DEATH THERE WAS LITTLE TO TELL EXCEPT THAT HE WAS KILLED IN SOME WILD PLACE AT THE WEST AND A STRANGER WROTE THE FACT TO THE ONLY PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS FOUND IN BEN'S POCKET BOOK MISTER SMITHERS OFFERED TO TAKE THE BOY BACK AND
AND IMMINENT DANGER OF GETTING EYES OR TEETH KNOCKED OUT THORNY WAS AN EXCELLENT PLAYER BUT NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO SHOW HIS PROWESS HE MADE BEN HIS PROXY AND SITTING ON THE FENCE ACTED AS UMPIRE TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT
CHAPTER TEN A HEAVY TROUBLE THANK YOU MA'AM THAT'S A TIP TOP BOOK SPECIALLY THE PICTURES BUT I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THESE POOR FELLOWS
AND BEN SWAYED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE WAS ALREADY DOING IT IN IMAGINATION YOU MAY TAKE A TURN ROUND MY FIELD ON LITA ANY DAY SHE WOULD LIKE IT AND THORNY'S SADDLE WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK SAID MISS CELIA
FOR PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF MUSIC FLOATED OUT FROM THE PARLOR MUSIC SO SOFT SO SWEET THAT INVOLUNTARILY THE BOY STOPPED HIS CRYING TO LISTEN THEN QUIETER TEARS DROPPED SLOWLY
PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE BOY APPRECIATED THE FINE PICTURES AND FELT SUCH HEARTY SYMPATHY WITH THE NOBLE ANIMALS WHOM SHE DEARLY LOVED HERSELF NEEDN'T WAIT FOR THAT I'D RATHER RIDE BAREBACK OH I SAY
NO NO I'D RATHER TRAMP AND STARVE HE'S AWFUL HARD TO ME AND SANCH AND HE'D BE WORSE NOW FATHER'S GONE DON'T SEND ME BACK LET ME STAY HERE FOLKS ARE GOOD TO ME THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER IT WAS VERY NAUGHTY TO COME BAB BUT SO LONG AS YOU DID YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT ANY THING I'LL SEE TO YOU AND YOU SHALL HAVE A REAL GOOD TIME SAID BEN ACCEPTING HIS RESPONSIBILITIES WITHOUT A MURMUR
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THE HEAD BEN HAD LIFTED UP WITH A DESPERATE SORT OF LOOK WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT
HOW LONG SHE PLAYED MISS CELIA NEVER MINDED BUT WHEN SHE STOLE OUT TO SEE IF BEN HAD GONE SHE FOUND THAT OTHER FRIENDS EVEN KINDER THAN HERSELF
AND GRAVELY PUT HIS PAW UPON HER KNEE WITH A LOW WHINE AS IF HE SAID COUNT ME IN AND LET ME HELP TO PAY MY MASTER'S DEBT IF I CAN MISS CELIA SHOOK THE OFFERED PAW CORDIALLY AND THE GOOD CREATURE CROUCHED AT HER FEET LIKE A SMALL LION
BAB STILL HELD THE STRAP INTENT ON KEEPING HER CHARGE SAFE THOUGH SHE LOST HERSELF BUT HER COURAGE SEEMED TO BE GIVING OUT AS SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD
I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD GO AT EVERY THING ESPECIALLY THE LIONS SAID SAM BEGINNING ON HIS LAST COOKIE I HEARD EM ROAR JUST NOW AND BILLY STOOD UP TO GAZE WITH BIG EYES AT THE FLAPPING CANVAS
GIRLS ARE SUCH A BOTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOCK ROUND NO BAB YOU CAN'T GO TRAVEL RIGHT HOME AND DON'T MAKE A FUSS COME ALONG BOYS
WHILE THIS CONTEST WAS GOING ON HANNIBAL ADVANCED HIS CENTRE SO AS TO FORM A SALIENT ANGLE PROJECTING IN FRONT OF HIS LINE THE WHOLE OF THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS TOOK PART IN THIS MOVEMENT WHILE THE AFRICANS REMAINED STATIONARY
FOR CARTHAGE WITH ITS HIDEOUS TYRANNY ITS FOUL CORRUPTION ITS FORGETFULNESS OF ITS GLORY ITS HONOUR AND EVEN ITS SAFETY IS UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME I TRUST THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL I SET FOOT WITHIN ITS WALLS
FOR WEEKS AFTERWARDS I SCARCELY SLEPT DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS BEFORE ME THAT TERRIBLE BRAZEN IMAGE OF MOLOCH
GRUDGE NO HARDSHIP OR SUFFERING TO HARDEN YOUR FRAME AND STRENGTHEN YOUR ARMS SOME DAY YOU TOO MAY LEAD ARMIES IN THE FIELD AND BELIEVE ME THEY WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL THE BETTER AND MORE CHEERFULLY
THAT HANNO'S PARTY WOULD BE ON THEIR GUARD IN FUTURE AND THAT THE JUDGES WOULD EFFECT WHOLESALE ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS WHEREAS WERE THE POPULACE APPEALED TO IN THE MIDST OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH WOULD BE CAUSED
NOT A ROMAN CAVALRY SOLDIER REMAINED ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED ON THE FIELD THE ROMAN INFANTRY NOW ADVANCED TO THE CHARGE AND FROM THE NATURE OF HANNIBAL'S FORMATION THEIR CENTRE FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE HEAD OF THE SALIENT ANGLE
IN REPLY TO THESE ARGUMENTS THE OTHER PARTY URGED THAT DELAYS WERE ALWAYS DANGEROUS THAT HUGE REWARDS WOULD BE OFFERED AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPTS THAT SOME OF THE MEN OF THE SECTIONS MIGHT TURN TRAITORS
AS HE HEARD THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF THE LEADING MEN OF CARTHAGE THE COUNCIL THUS OPENED WAS CONTINUED FOR THREE HOURS MOST OF THOSE PRESENT SPOKE BUT TO THE SURPRISE OF MALCHUS
BY THEM LIE THE HEAVY SWORDS WHICH THEY USE IN CLOSE QUARTERS THE THIRD BODY OF MEN ARE MORE HEAVILY ARMED ON THE GROUND NEAR THE SLEEPERS LIE HELMETS AND MASSIVE SHIELDS THEY HAVE TIGHTLY FITTING JERKINS OF WELL TANNED LEATHER
WHILE ANOTHER PRAETOR LUCIUS POSTUMIUS WITH ONE LEGION WAS IN CISALPINE GAUL KEEPING DOWN THE TRIBES FRIENDLY TO CARTHAGE BUT BEFORE THE NEW CONSULS ARRIVED TO TAKE THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY HANNIBAL HAD MOVED FROM GERONIUM
THE LAD SAID THE SHADOWS ARE LENGTHENING AND THE HEAT IS DECLINING WE HAVE ONLY YOUR WORD FOR THE DECLINE OF THE HEAT MALCHUS ONE OF THE YOUNGER MEN LAUGHED I FEEL HOTTER THAN EVER
BY THE DEATH OF HANNO AND HIS PRINCIPAL ADHERENTS THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE AND FINISH WITH THEIR TYRANTS AFTER ALL WHO WISHED TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT HAD GIVEN THEIR OPINIONS THEY PROCEEDED TO DETAILS
HE EXCLAIMED NOW IS THE TIME
CAN HAVE PLEASURE IN THE SCREAMS OF DYING INFANTS OR THE GROANS OF SLAUGHTERED MEN GISCON PLACED HIS HAND TO HIS EARS AS IF TO SHUT OUT SUCH BLASPHEMY AND HURRIED AWAY
EXECUTED FOR SOME TRIFLING OFFENCE BY THE TRIBUNALS SOME HAD BEEN RUINED BY THE EXTORTION OF THE TAX GATHERERS ALL WERE STATED TO BE READY TO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR VENGEANCE
AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
THE FOLLOWING WAS THE DISPOSITION OF HIS TROOPS THE SPANIARDS AND GAULS OCCUPIED THE CENTRE OF THE LINE OF INFANTRY THE AFRICANS FORMED THE TWO WINGS ON HIS LEFT FLANK BETWEEN THE AFRICANS AND THE RIVER HE PLACED HIS HEAVY AFRICAN AND GAULISH HORSE
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US THE RULERS AND ARISTOCRACY OF THIS GREAT CITY MY SON TO SHOW OURSELVES SUPERIOR TO THE COMMON HERD THEY MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY RICHER AND OF BETTER BLOOD BUT THAT WE ARE STRONGER
AND HAD GIVEN PROOF OF MILITARY ABILITY THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD COMMANDED AS CONSUL IN THE ILLYRIAN WAR VARRO BELONGED TO THE POPULAR PARTY
I WILL BE NO SHARER IN THE FATE OF CARTHAGE I HAVE DONE WITH HER AND IF I DO NOT FALL IN THE BATTLEFIELD I WILL
AT LAST THE DAY FOR EMBARKATION ARRIVED AND THE TROOPS DEFILED THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF MOLOCH WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE MALCHUS UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT READY AT THE LAST MOMENT LINGERED AT HOME
WILL SET OUR AGENTS TO WORK AMONG THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE NEWS OF ANOTHER VICTORY ARRIVES AND THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE AROUSED AND EXCITED WE WILL STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND CALL UPON THEM TO MAKE ONE GREAT EFFORT TO BRING THE STRUGGLE TO A CONCLUSION AND TO FINISH WITH ROME FOREVER
THEIR GENERAL COULD KEEP HIS ARMY TOGETHER IN READINESS TO STRIKE A BLOW WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED WHILE HANNIBAL ON THE OTHER HAND WAS FORCED TO SCATTER A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE ARMY IN SEARCH OF PROVISIONS
CHAPTER ONE THE CAMP IN THE DESERT IT IS AFTERNOON BUT THE SUN'S RAYS STILL POUR DOWN WITH GREAT POWER UPON ROCK AND SAND
OR TO LAUNCH THEIR TRIREMES TO ENGAGE THE FLEETS OF ROME THE SEVERE CHECKS WHICH THEY HAD LATELY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE NEWLY FORMED ROMAN NAVY AND THE CERTAINTY THAT ERE LONG A TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS MUST TAKE PLACE
LISTENING TO EVERY SOUND AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ANCHOR WAS WEIGHED THE SAILS HOISTED AND THE VESSEL BEGAN TO DRAW AWAY FROM CARTHAGE THAT HE WENT INTO HIS CABIN ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER LEAVING CARTHAGE THE SHIP ENTERED THE PORT OF CORINTH
A GOLD BELT ENCIRCLES HIS WAIST BELOW IT HANGS A GARMENT RESEMBLING THE MODERN KILT BUT REACHING HALFWAY BETWEEN THE KNEE AND THE ANKLE IT IS DYED A RICH PURPLE
NEAR THEM WERE A BODY OF GARAMANTES WRAPPED IN THE LONG BERNOUS WHICH THEN AS NOW WAS THE GARB OF THE CHILDREN OF THE DESERT TALL SWARTHY FIGURES THESE LISSOME AND AGILE WITH EVERY MUSCLE STANDING OUT CLEAR THROUGH THE BROWN SKIN
IF THEY KNOW THAT IN STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AS WELL AS IN POSITION THEIR COMMANDER IS THE FOREMOST MAN IN HIS ARMY MALCHUS HAD BEEN AN APT PUPIL AND HAD DONE JUSTICE TO THE PAINS WHICH HIS FATHER HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM AND TO THE TRAINING HE HAD UNDERGONE
THE GREAT ROMAN MAGAZINE OF APULIA WAS AT CANNAE A TOWN NEAR THE RIVER AULIDUS THIS IMPORTANT PLACE WAS BUT FIFTY MILES BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE ACROSS THE PLAIN FROM GERONIUM BUT THE ROMANS WERE UNABLE TO FOLLOW DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PLAIN
WITHOUT A WORD AND FASTENED IT TO A RING IN THE WALL WHERE FOUR OR FIVE OTHER HORSES WERE STANDING I RATHER WONDER YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF DRAWING ATTENTION BY RIDING ON HORSEBACK TO A HOUSE IN SUCH A QUARTER
WE WANT TO CROSS TO ITALY HE SAID BUT WE HAVE OUR REASONS FOR NOT WISHING TO LAND AT BRUNDUSIUM AND WOULD FAIN BE PUT ASHORE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN WE ARE READY OF COURSE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE TROUBLE THE REQUEST DID NOT SEEM STRANGE TO THE CAPTAIN
HE WHEELED ROUND BOTH HIS FLANKS AND THE AFRICANS WHO HAD HITHERTO NOT STRUCK A BLOW NOW FELL IN PERFECT ORDER UPON THE FLANKS OF THE ROMAN MASS WHILE HASDRUBAL WITH HIS VICTORIOUS CAVALRY CHARGED DOWN LIKE A TORRENT UPON THEIR REAR
IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST FOR A SHORT TIME REMAIN IN CONCEALMENT WHILE I ARRANGE FOR A SHIP TO CARRY YOU BACK TO ITALY
BY WHICH IT IS SUSPENDED OVER HIS SHOULDER TWO OF HIS COMPANIONS ARE YOUNG MEN OF THREE OR FOUR AND TWENTY BOTH FAIR LIKE HIMSELF WITH FEATURES OF ALMOST GREEK REGULARITY OF OUTLINE THEIR DRESS IS SIMILAR TO HIS IN FASHION
YOUR RESTLESSNESS IS ENOUGH TO GIVE ONE THE FEVER
THE COMMAND OF THE SEA MUST BE REGAINED AND FRESH LEVIES OF TROOPS MADE TO ASK CARTHAGE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES IN HER PRESENT MOOD IS HOPELESS WE MUST AWAIT AN OPPORTUNITY I AND MY FRIENDS WILL PREPARE THE WAY
SOME LIBYAN GROOMS ARE RUBBING DOWN THE COATS OF FOUR HORSES OF THE PUREST BREED OF THE DESERT WHILE TWO NUBIANS ARE FEEDING WITH LARGE FLAT CAKES THREE ELEPHANTS WHO CHAINED BY THE LEG TO TREES
THEREFORE NO HARM CAN YET HAVE BEEN DONE STRIKE MY NAME OFF THE LIST AND FORGET THAT I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU YOU HAVE MY OATH THAT I WILL SAY NOUGHT OF ANYTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD YOU CAN WELL MAKE SOME EXCUSE TO YOUR COMRADES
THIS BODY ALL COMPOSED OF YOUNG MEN OF THE BEST FAMILIES OF CARTHAGE
THEY HAD BEFORE EMBARKING LAID IN A STORE OF PROVISIONS NOT ONLY FOR A VOYAGE BUT FOR THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THE SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE WHICH MALCHUS HAD OF THE LATIN TONGUE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM AT ONCE WERE HE OBLIGED TO ENTER A TOWN OR VILLAGE TO PURCHASE FOOD
CONSTANTLY REPLENISHED BY THEIR ALLIES AND MOVE WHERE THEY MIGHT THEY WERE SURE OF OBTAINING SUBSISTENCE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THUS UPON THE MARCH THEY WERE UNEMBARRASSED BY THE NECESSITY OF TAKING A GREAT BAGGAGE TRAIN WITH THEM AND WHEN HALTED
MATTERS ARE GETTING RIPE I HAVE EIGHT MEN SWORN INTO MY SECTION AMONG THE WEAVERS
OH NO SAID I I PREFER TO RUN BY MYSELF FOR I CAN EASILY FIND THE WAY AND I WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY IF THAT IS THE CASE REPLIED SANTA I MUST GIVE YOU A MAGIC COLLAR TO WEAR SO THAT YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM
IT WAS ONE MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS SAID THE RABBIT WHO SEEMED TO ENJOY TALKING NOW THAT HE HAD OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF DOROTHY AND I WAS SITTING BY THE ROAD SIDE WHEN SANTA CLAUS CAME RIDING BACK IN HIS EMPTY SLEIGH HE DOES NOT COME HOME QUITE SO FAST AS HE GOES
NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
AND THE PEOPLE ALL WEPT WITH GRIEF AT THIS AND SOLOMON HOWLED LOUDER THAN ANY OF THEM NOW THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN SOLOMON JUMPED INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE WAS WEARING HIS SPECTACLES
AND AFTER THAT NO ONE EVER QUESTIONED THE WOND'ROUS WISDOM OF OUR WISE MAN AND WHEN HE FINALLY DIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE THEY BUILT A GREAT MONUMENT OVER HIS GRAVE
WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
THE WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS SOMETHING NEW AMONGST THEM ONCE I VISITED SANTA AND SAW HIM MAKE THE TOYS
PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
YOUR FATHER MEANT YOU TO WATCH THE FLOWERS IN THE FIELD AND IF YOU WILL COME AND VISIT THEM EACH DAY YOU WILL FIND THE TIME WAITING VERY SHORT INDEED MARY DRIED HER EYES AND THANKED THE KINDLY OLD SQUIRE
FOR WE BOTH SHALL BE GLAD TO WELCOME OUR DEAR ONES HOME AGAIN BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE CAME RIDING UP AS WAS HIS WONT TO WHERE MARY STOOD BY HER GARDEN AND HE AT ONCE ASKED
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
SURELY THIS IS THE TOWN OF NORWICH RETURNED THE WOMAN I CAME HERE TO SEE IF I COULD GET SOME PEASE PORRIDGE CONTINUED THE MAN
SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR
AND THE FURNITURE TO SHOW A GOOD MANY SCRATCHES AND BRUISES BUT THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AS WELL AS SHE WAS ABLE UNTIL SARAH HER THIRD DAUGHTER ALSO DIED AND THREE MORE CHILDREN WERE SENT TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE BROUGHT UP
GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS
I SHALL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE AND WATCH THE GARDEN GROW
NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
AND YOU SHALL PLANT YOUR FLOWERS AND CARE FOR THEM YOURSELF I THINK I D RATHER HAVE THE FLOWERS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE SAID MARY BUT WHY ENQUIRED HER MOTHER THEY WILL BE BETTER SHELTERED AT THE SIDE
AND EVEN WHEN A CHILD HE WAS SO REMARKABLE FOR HIS WISDOM THAT PEOPLE SHOOK THEIR HEADS GRAVELY AND SAID WHEN HE GROWS UP THERE WILL BE NO NEED OF BOOKS FOR HE WILL KNOW EVERYTHING
AND THE MAN WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE TOOK A BIG SPOONFUL AT ONCE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH THAN HE UTTERED A GREAT YELL AND BEGAN DANCING FRANTICALLY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR OF COURSE
AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN SHE SAID ONE DAY TO THE BAKER MAN THAT I OFTEN REALLY DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
THE OLD WOMAN WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THIS NEW ADDITION TO HER FAMILY BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AGAIN AND HAD HIM BUILD ANOTHER ADDITION TO HER HOUSE AS THE PICTURE SHOWS
BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEM SETTLED IN THEIR NEW HOME WHEN MARGARET ANOTHER OF HER DAUGHTERS DIED AND SENT FOUR MORE CHILDREN TO HER MOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE OLD WOMAN SCARCELY KNEW WHERE TO KEEP THIS NEW FLOCK THAT HAD COME TO HER FOLD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
AND HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE THE HOURS WERE VERY DULL AND TEDIOUS AND MARY COUNTED THE DAYS UNTIL THE SAILORS CAME HOME AGAIN ONE SPRING
AND PUT BOTH ARMS TIGHT AROUND THE MOONBEAM AND STARTED TO SLIDE DOWN BUT HE FOUND IT RATHER SLIPPERY AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS TO HOLD ON HE FOUND HIMSELF GOING
WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK WELL REALLY REPLIED THE ABASHED SCHOOLMASTER I HAVE NEVER GIVEN THE SUBJECT SERIOUS THOUGHT BUT
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
DEEP WRINKLES SEAMED HER FACE AND HANDS WHILE HER NOSE AND CHIN WERE SO POINTED THAT THEY NEARLY MET SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK UPON BUT BO PEEP HAD LEARNED TO BE POLITE TO THE AGED SO SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY
IT MUST BE VASTLY MORE PLEASANT TO HAVE COMPANIONS TO TALK TO THAN TO BE SHUT UP IN A BIG PLANET ALL BY HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD TO WHISTLE TO KEEP HIMSELF COMPANY ONE DAY
ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHURCHES OF CHARLESTON AND EVERYWHERE FLUTTERED THE PALMETTO FLAG SYLVIA SAT IN THE STERN BESIDE HER FATHER AND VERY SOON THE TILLER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE WAS SHAPING THE BOAT'S COURSE TOWARD THE FORTS
NEVER IN ALL HER LIFE HAD SYLVIA BEEN SO WRETCHED SHE SAT QUITE STILL IN THE WARM SAND AND WONDERED WHAT SHE COULD DO IF SHE WENT HOME HER MOTHER WOULD INSIST UPON AN EXPLANATION OF HER UNTIDY CONDITION BESIDE THAT
THE GIRL GAVE HER MESSAGE TO MISSUS FULTON IN SO INDEFINITE A MANNER THAT AT FIRST SYLVIA'S MOTHER HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHETHER SYLVIA WAS IN THE GARDEN OF THE SCHOOL OR HAD STARTED FOR HOME ESTRALLA WAS STANDING NEAR THE STEPS AND BEGAN WHIMPERING
BECAUSE REALLY SOUTH CAROLINA DOES OWN THE FORTS MY FATHER SAID SO HE SAID THAT SOUTH CAROLINA WAS A SOVEREIGN STATE SHE CONCLUDED WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S A SOVEREIGN QUESTIONED SYLVIA GRACE SHOOK HER HEAD
SHE REACHED THE TOP JUST AS SHE HEARD MISS ROSALIE'S SERVANT CALLING HER NAME SYLVIA LOOKED DOWN TO THE FURTHER SIDE THE VINES DROOPED OVER AND BELOW THE WALL A HIGH BANK OF SAND SLOPED TO THE SHORE HOLDING TIGHT TO THE VINES SHE SLID DOWN
IT HAS BEEN RATHER HARD FOR YOUR FATHER AND ME MISSUS FULTON REMINDED HER WE BEGAN TO FEAR SOME DREADFUL THING HAD HAPPENED TO OUR LITTLE GIRL PROMISE ME SYLVIA NEVER TO RUN AWAY FROM SCHOOL AGAIN SYLVIA PROMISED
THEY SAY SLAVERY ISN'T RIGHT THERE WAS A LITTLE MURMUR OF LAUGHTER AMONG THE OTHER GIRLS FOR IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA BELIEVED THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT IN BUYING NEGROES FOR SLAVES AND IN SELLING THEM WHEN THEY DESIRED
SHE WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT FUN TO TEACH ESTRALLA AND TO HAVE LESSONS WITH HER MOTHER WAS EVEN BETTER THAN RECITING TO PRETTY MISS ROSALIE
HE WAS THINKING THAT CHARLESTON PEOPLE MUST BE QUITE READY TO TAKE THE SERIOUS STEP OF URGING THEIR STATE TO DECLARE HER SECESSION FROM THE UNITED STATES AND HER RIGHT TO BUY AND SELL HUMAN BEINGS AS SLAVES HE WISHED THAT THE UNITED STATES OFFICERS AT FORT MOULTRIE
GRACE GRACE CALLED MISS ROSALIE AND BEFORE SYLVIA COULD RESPOND HER LOYAL PLAYMATE HAD TURNED OBEDIENTLY BACK TO THE HOUSE SYLVIA STEPPED OUT ON THE STREET HER EYES A LITTLE BLURRED BY TEARS
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SYLVIA STARTED TO FIND ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAD BEEN CALLED TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TELL SYLVIA I WON'T BE GONE LONG SHE HAD SAID TO GRACE GRACE DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE UNTIL SYLVIA RETURNED
SHE BEGAN TEACHING ESTRALLA ON THE VERY DAY OF HER RETURN AND THE LITTLE DARKY MADE RAPID PROGRESS FATHER WHEN MAY WE GO TO FORT MOULTRIE AGAIN SHE ASKED ONE MORNING A FEW DAYS LATER
BUT THAT PHILIP SHOULD WANT THE PALMETTO FLAG TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE STARS AND STRIPES OVER FORT SUMTER SEEMED A MUCH GREATER MISFORTUNE WHEN HE KNOWS IT STANDS FOR SLAVERY SHE THOUGHT WONDERING IF HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT DINKIE
AND THEIR CHARLESTON HOME WAS IN ONE OF THE HISTORIC MANSIONS OF THAT CITY BESIDE THAT THERE WAS THE BIG OLD HOUSE ON THE ASHLEY RIVER TEN MILES FROM THE CITY WHERE THE FAMILY STAYED A PART OF THE TIME
THAT SHE NEARLY UPSET THE PLATE OF COOKIES COULD WE OH ESTRALLA COULD WE REALLY SHE EXCLAIMED ESTRALLA LOOKED AT HER LITTLE MISTRESS WITH WONDERING EYES YAS COURSE NOBODY'D MIND TWO LEETLE NIGGER GALS BUT YOU AIN'T BLACK MISSY
FOR VERY FEW SLAVE OWNERS ALLOWED ANYONE TO TEACH THE SLAVES TO READ AND WRITE ESTRALLA KNEW THIS AND IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING THAT MISSY SYLVIA PROPOSED I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT TO MORROW MORNING SAID SYLVIA NOW RUN AWAY
BUT I DID WANT TO KNOW IT WOULD BE DREADFUL NOT TO SEE THEM WHERE THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
I THINK IT IS A LOVELY SONG SAID SYLVIA I'LL TELL MY MOTHER ABOUT IT I AM SO GLAD YOU TOLD ME GRACE SYLVIA FULTON WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND HAD LIVED IN CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA FOR THE PAST YEAR BEFORE THAT THE FULTONS HAD LIVED IN BOSTON
THEY SHALL SHE SOBBED AS SHE GOT TO HER FEET AND TURNED TOWARD THE SHORE SHE KNEW SHE MUST EITHER GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE SCHOOLROOM OR ELSE FIND A HIDING PLACE UNTIL THEY HAD CEASED TO SEARCH FOR HER THERE WAS A WALL AT THE FOOT OF THE GARDEN COVERED WITH FRAGRANT JESSAMINE AND MYRTLE
PERHAPS IT MIGHT EVEN BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP CAROLINIANS TO GIVE UP SLAVERY AND THEN ESTRALLA AND AUNT CONNIE AND ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND LIKED COULD BE SAFE AND HAVE HOMES OF THEIR OWN SYLVIA WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PEERED OUT
YOU CAN TELL YOUR MAMMY I GAVE YOU THE DRESS NOW RUN QUICK MY MOTHER MAY COME ESTRALLA STOOD QUITE STILL LOOKING AT SYLVIA SHE HAD STOPPED LAUGHING
I'LL GET WHIPPED YAS'M I WILL FER BREAKING THE PITCHER YOU WON'T DECLARED SYLVIA HALF ANGRILY IT'S MY MOTHER'S PITCHER AND I'LL TELL HER YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK IT NOW YOU GO AND PUT ON ANOTHER DRESS AND TELL JENNIE TO COME UP HERE AND WIPE UP THIS FLOOR
MISSY WANTS A BIG PITCHER OF HOT WATER REPLIED ESTRALLA DANCING ABOUT JUST BEYOND AUNT CONNIE'S REACH MISSY SYLVIA SAY TO TELL YOU WE BEEN CARRYIN DE CAKE TO HER FR'EN AN SHE GWINE TO TELL YOU MAMMY EXPLAINED ESTRALLA WHEN HER MAMMY HAD FINALLY GRASPED HER FIRMLY BY THE SHOULDERS
ELINOR MAYHEW STOOD ON THE STEPS YOU ARE JUST AS MUCH A YANKEE AS I AM AND YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF IT DECLARED SYLVIA FACING THE OLDER GIRL HEAR THAT GIRLS CALLED ELINOR TO THE GROUP ABOUT HER
SHE MIGHT AS WELL LEARN THAT SOUTH CAROLINIANS WILL NOT BE INSULTED AND ELINOR LIFTED HER HEAD PROUDLY I WON'T TAKE IT BACK RETORTED SYLVIA AND YOU ARE THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE TO APOLOGIZE YES
GREATLY TO THE SATISFACTION OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER WHO HAD FEARED THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY OVER THE SCHOOL AFFAIR THEY WERE SORRY IT HAD HAPPENED BUT THEY COULD NOT BLAME SYLVIA OH MISSY SYLVIA
SHE CALLED AND RAN TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE BOAT UNCLE PETER HAD A GREAT DEAL OF NEWS TO TELL HE SAID THAT UNLESS MAJOR ANDERSON AND HIS SOLDIERS LEFT FORT SUMTER AT ONCE THAT ALL THE FORTS AND THE NEW BATTERIES BUILT BY THE CONFEDERATES WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON SUMTER AND DESTROY IT
SYLVIA ATE HER BREAKFAST HURRIEDLY AND RAN UPSTAIRS FOR HER CAPE AND HAT
AS USUAL FLORA WAS WAITING AT MISS PATTEN'S GATE FOR HER FRIENDS SHE WAS WEARING A PRETTY TURBAN HAT AND PINNED IN FRONT WAS A FINE BLUE COCKADE TO WHICH FLORA POINTED AND SAID LOOK GIRLS
SHE KNEW THAT THE PALMETTO FLAG STOOD FOR SLAVERY SYLVIA DID NOT KNOW WHAT MISS ROSALIE WOULD SAY TO HER AND EVEN WORSE THAN HER TEACHER'S DISAPPROVAL SHE WAS SURE THAT HER SCHOOLMATES
ANNOUNCED GRACE OH ONLY JUST A LITTLE RESPONDED FLORA QUICKLY I THINK FLORA CAN DO MORE THINGS THAN ANY GIRL I EVER KNEW DECLARED SYLVIA ADMIRINGLY AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT THE SERVANTS DID EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD FLORA LAUGHED
FLORA HAD A PAIR OF WHITE PONIES AND THERE WERE PIGEONS AND A NUMBER OF DOGS SYLVIA WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL VISIT ESPECIALLY AS GRACE WOULD BE THERE AS SHE WENT SMILINGLY TOWARD HER SEAT IN THE SCHOOLROOM SHE PASSED ELINOR MAYHEW WHO WAS ALREADY SEATED
BUT FIRST OF ALL HE MUST SEE THE SCHOONER'S CARGO SAFELY UNLOADED AT FORT SUMTER AND SEND HIS MEN BACK TO FORT MOULTRIE
SYLVIA HURRIED HOME EAGER TO TELL HER MOTHER OF HER WONDERFUL NEW FRIEND AND OF FLORA'S DEPARTURE TO THE PLANTATION MISSUS FULTON LISTENED IN SURPRISE BUT WHEN SYLVIA FINISHED HER STORY OF MISTER WAITE'S KINDNESS
GRACE WAS EAGER TO GET TO HER DESK FROM WHERE SHE SAT SHE COULD SEE THE GRIM LINES OF THE DISTANT FORTS AND THIS MORNING THEY HAD A NEW VALUE AND INTEREST FOR HER FOR AT BREAKFAST SHE HAD HEARD HER FATHER SAY
NO RESPONSE CAME TO HER CALLS SO SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND ALONG THE WALK WHICH LED TO THE SAND BARS PAST THE HOUSES AND BARRACKS ON SULLIVAN'S ISLAND NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT WHOM SHE COULD ASK IF ESTRALLA HAD PASSED THAT WAY
CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHERE IS SYLVIA THE BUTTERFLY WAS ALL READY AND WAITING FOR ITS PASSENGERS WHEN GRACE AND SYLVIA FOLLOWED BY THE SMILING AND DELIGHTED ESTRALLA
BOTH GRACE AND FLORA ADVISED SYLVIA NOT TO TELL HER MOTHER OF ELINOR'S UNKINDNESS OR OF HER TAUNTING WORDS
SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID NOR DID SHE RESIST WE OUGHT TO MAKE HER TAKE IT BACK SAID MAY BAILEY AS ELINOR STOPPED AND THEY ALL STOOD IN A CLOSE GROUP ABOUT SYLVIA
WHAR ON AIRTH YOU BEEN AN WHAR'S YO MISSY DEMANDED AUNT CONNIE
THEN FROM ONE OF THE BUREAU DRAWERS SHE DREW OUT A LONG BLUE SILK SCARF AND TWISTED IT ABOUT HER HEAD I CAN PULL THE END OVER MY FACE AND THEY'LL THINK I'M A DARKY SHE THOUGHT RESOLVED IF ANYONE SPOKE TO HER NOT TO ANSWER
AND THE GOOD NATURED CAPTAIN RESTED A KINDLY HAND ON THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHOULDER AND WALKED DOWN THE WHARF SYLVIA HEARD THE MEN TALKING OF THE CHARLESTON ARSENAL AND OF THE BOXES OF ARMS WHICH WERE TO BE TAKEN ON THE SCHOONER TO FORT SUMTER
AND YOU MUST ASK YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS IN TAKING YOU SO FAR FROM HOME SAID THE CAPTAIN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA ESCORTED BY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FROM FORT SUMTER CAME WALKING UP EAST BATTERY
SO THAT SHE FEELS LAME AND TIRED AND I THOUGHT A FEW HOURS IN BED WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR HER EXPLAINED MISSUS HAYES MAMMY DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW JUST HOW IT HAPPENED SHE CONCLUDED
AND THAT ALL THE TREASURE WAS AT HIS SOLE DISPOSAL HE PUT AS MUCH GOLD INTO HIS SADDLE BAG AS HIS HORSE COULD CARRY AND RETURNED TO TOWN
AND IN ALL ABOUT FIVE OR SIX GALLONS OF RACK THESE I STOWED BY THEMSELVES THERE BEING NO NEED TO PUT THEM INTO THE CHEST NOR ANY ROOM FOR THEM WHILE I WAS DOING THIS I FOUND THE TIDE BEGIN TO FLOW THOUGH VERY CALM
YET THE SEA WENT DREADFULLY HIGH UPON THE SHORE AND MIGHT BE WELL CALLED
ALADDIN HAD FETCHED SOME WATER AND SPRINKLED IT IN HER FACE TO RECOVER HER WHETHER THAT OR THE SMELL OF THE MEAT EFFECTED HER CURE IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE CAME TO HERSELF MOTHER SAID ALADDIN BE NOT AFRAID GET UP AND EAT HERE IS WHAT
AT LAST I ARRIVED HAPPILY AT BAGDAD
I CAST MY EYES TO THE SHIP AND THERE SHE RODE WITHIN LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A MILE OF THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD WEIGHED HER ANCHOR AS SOON AS THEY WERE MASTERS OF HER AND THE WEATHER BEING FAIR HAD BROUGHT HER TO AN ANCHOR
WHICH TOOK ME UP THE REST OF THAT DAY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT NOR INDEED WHERE TO REST FOR I WAS AFRAID TO LIE DOWN ON THE GROUND NOT KNOWING BUT SOME WILD BEAST MIGHT DEVOUR ME
ACCORDINGLY BOTH MOTHER AND SON SAT DOWN AND ATE WITH THE BETTER RELISH AS THE TABLE WAS SO WELL FURNISHED
BOUGHT SOME CAKES OF BREAD CHANGED HIS MONEY AND ON HIS RETURN GAVE THE REST TO HIS MOTHER WHO WENT AND PURCHASED PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO LAST THEM SOME TIME AFTER THIS MANNER THEY LIVED TILL ALADDIN HAD SOLD THE TWELVE DISHES SINGLY
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP LEADING TO A DOOR DESCEND MY SON SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THOSE STEPS AND OPEN THAT DOOR IT WILL LEAD YOU INTO A PALACE DIVIDED INTO THREE GREAT HALLS IN EACH OF THESE
HE MEANT TO CARRY HIM FURTHER TO EXECUTE HIS DESIGN HE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN IN ONE OF THE GARDENS ON THE BRINK OF A FOUNTAIN OF CLEAR WATER WHICH DISCHARGED ITSELF BY A LION'S MOUTH
ALL THE PEOPLE THE KING HIMSELF NOT EXCEPTED RODE THEIR HORSES WITHOUT BRIDLE OR STIRRUPS
AND AS A NEWCOMER WAS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM EXTREMELY CIVIL AND COMPLAISANT TO ALL THE MERCHANTS HIS NEIGHBORS ALI BABA'S SON WAS FROM HIS VICINITY ONE OF THE FIRST TO CONVERSE WITH COGIA HOUSSAIN WHO STROVE TO CULTIVATE HIS FRIENDSHIP MORE PARTICULARLY
WHO HAD ALMOST FINISHED DIGGING THE HOLE WHILE ALI BABA WAS BURYING THE GOLD HIS WIFE TO SHOW HER EXACTNESS AND DILIGENCE TO HER SISTER IN LAW CARRIED THE MEASURE BACK AGAIN BUT WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE THAT A PIECE OF GOLD HAD STUCK TO THE BOTTOM SISTER
AND THE SHIP WAS TAKEN EFFECTUALLY WITHOUT ANY MORE LIVES LOST AS SOON AS THE SHIP WAS THUS SECURED THE CAPTAIN ORDERED GUNS TO BE FIRED WHICH WAS THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON WITH ME TO GIVE ME NOTICE OF HIS SUCCESS WHICH YOU MAY BE SURE
CHILD SAID SHE TO WHOM ARE WE OBLIGED FOR THIS GREAT PLENTY AND LIBERALITY HAS THE SULTAN BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH OUR POVERTY AND HAD COMPASSION ON US
THEY WERE NOT LONG IN DOING IT WHEN THIS WAS DONE ALI BABA HID THE JARS AND WEAPONS AND AS HE HAD NO OCCASION FOR THE MULES HE SENT THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO BE SOLD IN THE MARKET BY HIS SLAVE
I FOUND ALSO THAT THE ISLAND I WAS IN WAS BARREN AND AS I SAW GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE UNINHABITED EXCEPT BY WILD BEASTS OF WHOM HOWEVER I SAW NONE YET I SAW ABUNDANCE OF FOWLS BUT KNEW NOT THEIR KINDS
AND IT WAS NOW THE BUSINESS OF THE PRISONERS AS MUCH AS OF THE CAPTAIN TO PERSUADE THE OTHER FIVE TO DO THEIR DUTY OUR STRENGTH WAS NOW THUS ORDERED FOR THE EXPEDITION FIRST THE CAPTAIN HIS MATE AND PASSENGER SECOND THE TWO PRISONERS OF THE FIRST GANG
THE SHIP DID NOT BREAK YET AND THAT THE MASTER SAID THE WIND BEGAN TO ABATE NOW THOUGH WE THOUGHT THE WIND DID A LITTLE ABATE YET THE SHIP HAVING THUS STRUCK UPON THE SAND AND STICKING TOO FAST FOR US TO EXPECT HER GETTING OFF
HOWEVER THERE WAS NO ROOM TO DEBATE FOR WE FANCIED THE SHIP WOULD BREAK IN PIECES EVERY MINUTE AND SOME TOLD US SHE WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN ALREADY IN THIS DISTRESS THE MATE OF OUR VESSEL
I BELIEVE IT WOULD BRING SOMETHING MORE SHE TOOK SOME FINE SAND AND WATER TO CLEAN IT BUT
I WILL TAKE A SHOP FOR YOU FURNISH IT WITH ALL SORTS OF FINE STUFFS AND LINENS AND THEN WITH THE MONEY YOU MAKE OF THEM YOU CAN LAY IN FRESH GOODS AND LIVE IN AN HONORABLE WAY TELL ME FREELY WHAT YOU THINK OF MY PROPOSAL
GIVE MY LOVE TO HER AND TELL HER THAT I WILL VISIT HER TO MORROW THAT I MAY SEE WHERE MY GOOD BROTHER LIVED SO LONG AND ENDED HIS DAYS ALADDIN RAN TO HIS MOTHER OVERJOYED AT THE MONEY HIS UNCLE HAD GIVEN HIM MOTHER
WENT TO THE BATHS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE IMPORTANT EVENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED AT HOME WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THE BATHS HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE OIL JARS AND THAT THE MERCHANT WAS NOT GONE WITH THE MULES HE ASKED MORGIANA WHO OPENED THE DOOR
I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR HAVING SAT WATCHING UPON THE SHORE FOR IT TILL NEAR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HAVING THUS HEARD THE SIGNAL PLAINLY I LAID ME DOWN AND IT HAVING BEEN A DAY OF GREAT FATIGUE TO ME I SLEPT SOUND
HOW CAME THAT VILE GENIE TO ADDRESS HIMSELF TO ME AND NOT TO YOU TO WHOM HE HAD APPEARED BEFORE IN THE CAVE MOTHER ANSWERED ALADDIN THE GENIE YOU SAW IS NOT THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO ME IF YOU REMEMBER
AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO PURCHASE UPON THE COAST FOR TRIFLES SUCH AS BEADS TOYS KNIVES SCISSORS HATCHETS BITS OF GLASS AND THE LIKE NOT ONLY GOLD DUST GUINEA GRAINS ELEPHANTS TEETH ET CETERA
I AM THOROUGHLY PERSUADED OF YOUR GOOD WILL BUT THE TRUTH IS I CAN EAT NO VICTUALS THAT HAVE ANY SALT IN THEM
WHEN THE MAGICIAN HAD MADE CHOICE OF A PLACE AND SAT DOWN HE BEGAN TO ENTER INTO DISCOURSE WITH ALADDIN'S MOTHER MY GOOD SISTER SAID HE
IN SHORT THERE WAS FRUIT OF ALL COLORS THE WHITE WERE PEARLS THE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT DIAMONDS THE DEEP RED RUBIES THE PALER
AND GAVE ME MONEY SENDING HIS LOVE TO YOU AND PROMISING TO COME AND PAY YOU A VISIT THAT HE MAY SEE THE HOUSE MY FATHER LIVED AND DIED IN INDEED CHILD REPLIED THE MOTHER YOUR FATHER HAD NO BROTHER
THE NATURE OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN PLACE IT SEEMED AN ENDLESS CAVERN AND MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY FATHOMS DEEP I LIVED FOR SOME TIME THERE UPON MY BREAD AND WATER
SO HE CAME OUT FIRST AND STOOD TO SEE THEM ALL PASS BY HIM WHEN ALI BABA HEARD HIM MAKE THE DOOR CLOSE BY PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS SHUT SESAME EVERY MAN AT ONCE WENT AND BRIDLED HIS HORSE FASTENED HIS WALLET
AND ALL THAT WAS IN THAT PART WAS DRY FOR YOU MAY BE SURE MY FIRST WORK WAS TO SEARCH AND TO SEE WHAT WAS SPOILED AND WHAT WAS FREE AND FIRST I FOUND THAT ALL THE SHIP'S PROVISIONS WERE DRY AND UNTOUCHED BY THE WATER AND BEING VERY WELL DISPOSED TO EAT
AND ABUNDANCE OF OTHER THINGS BUT BESIDES THESE AND WHAT WAS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE USEFUL TO ME HE BROUGHT ME SIX NEW CLEAN SHIRTS SIX VERY GOOD NECKCLOTHS TWO PAIR OF GLOVES ONE PAIR OF SHOES A HAT
THAT SUCH THINGS AS THESE WERE THE TESTIMONIES WE HAD OF A SECRET HAND OF PROVIDENCE GOVERNING THE WORLD AND AN EVIDENCE THAT THE EYE OF AN INFINITE POWER COULD SEARCH INTO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE WORLD
IN THE FORM OF A RAFT AND LAYING TWO OR THREE SHORT PIECES OF PLANK UPON THEM CROSSWAYS
AND MY WHOLE BEING AS I MAY SAY
AND ATE WITH GREEDINESS BUT I SUSPECTING SOME TRICK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS TASTE IT
THIS AGREEABLE RETREAT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO ME AFTER MY MISFORTUNES AND THE KINDNESS OF THIS GENEROUS PRINCE COMPLETED MY SATISFACTION
THEY WOULD BE FETCHED INTO THE CASTLE AND BE LAID IN IRONS SO THAT AS WE NEVER SUFFERED THEM TO SEE ME AS GOVERNOR I NOW APPEARED AS ANOTHER PERSON AND SPOKE OF THE GOVERNOR THE GARRISON THE CASTLE AND THE LIKE UPON ALL OCCASIONS
CASSIM DESIRED HER TO EXPLAIN THE RIDDLE WHICH SHE DID BY TELLING HIM THE STRATAGEM SHE HAD USED TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY AND SHOWED HIM THE PIECE OF MONEY WHICH WAS SO OLD THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL IN WHAT PRINCE'S REIGN IT WAS COINED
SAID SHE GIVING IT TO HER AGAIN YOU SEE THAT I HAVE NOT KEPT YOUR MEASURE LONG I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT AND RETURN IT WITH THANKS AS SOON AS ALI BABA'S WIFE WAS GONE CASSIM'S WIFE LOOKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE
ALI BABA MARRIED A WOMAN AS POOR AS HIMSELF AND LIVED BY CUTTING WOOD AND BRINGING IT UPON THREE ASSES INTO THE TOWN TO SELL ONE DAY WHEN ALI BABA WAS IN THE FOREST
BY PASSING OFTEN BY IT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MISTAKE IT THE CAPTAIN WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS ATTEMPT AND INFORMED OF WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW RETURNED TO THE FOREST AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CAVE WHERE THE TROOP WAITED FOR HIM SAID
AND A GREAT ROLL OF SHEET LEAD BUT THIS LAST WAS SO HEAVY I COULD NOT HOIST IT UP TO GET IT OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE BESIDES THESE THINGS I TOOK ALL THE MEN'S CLOTHES THAT I COULD FIND AND A SPARE FORE TOPSAIL A HAMMOCK AND SOME BEDDING
AND HAVING PUT OUT THE GREAT FIRE SHE HAD MADE TO BOIL THE OIL AND LEAVING JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BROTH PUT OUT THE LAMP ALSO
FAVOR IS DECEITFUL AND BEAUTY IS VAIN AND IN ANOTHER PLACE HE THAT FLATTERETH HIS NEIGHBOR SPREADETH A NET FOR HIS FEET SO I WILL TRY TO KEEP AWAY FROM THAT LADY SHALL I NOT PAPA WHENEVER YOU CAN DO SO WITHOUT RUDENESS DAUGHTER
AND DID NOT COME UP AGAIN UNTIL AFTER I RETURNED VERY WELL
WILL YOU DARE TO TELL ME SUCH A FALSEHOOD AS THAT AGAIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DINSMORE ANGRILY TAKING HIM BY THE COLLAR AND SHAKING HIM ROUGHLY
PAPA KNEW BEST AFTER ALL DID HE NOT ASKED HER FATHER DRAWING HER TO HIM AND PATTING HER CHEEK YES PAPA SHE SAID SOFTLY YOU ALWAYS KNOW BEST AND I AM VERY SORRY I WAS NAUGHTY HE ANSWERED WITH A KISS AND TAKING HER HAND LED HER DOWN TO THE DRAWING ROOM
STUDYING AND RECITING TO HIM THEN THEY TOOK A LONG RIDE ON HORSEBACK AND WHEN THEY RETURNED SHE FOUND THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AMONG THEM WAS CAROLINE HOWARD A FAVORITE FRIEND OF ELSIE'S
HE STOPPED REMARKING YOUR LITTLE GIRL LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT WHAT IS IT MY DEAR ELSIE BLUSHED HESITATED AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER YES SPEAK MY DAUGHTER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY ELSIE LIFTED
WHISPERED ELSIE WHO HAD A GREAT DREAD OF MISSUS DINSMORE'S ANGER VERY WELL THEN YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE HE REPLIED GIVING HER A GOOD NIGHT KISS AND WITH A GRACEFUL GOOD NIGHT TO THE COMPANY THE LITTLE GIRL LEFT THE ROOM
VERY SWEET LITTLE GIRL I AM SURE AND I SHALL LOVE YOU DEARLY SHE SAID KISSING HER SEVERAL TIMES AH I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IF I HAD SUCH A CLEAR FAIR COMPLEXION AND SUCH ROSY CHEEKS THAT MAKES YOU BLUSH WELL I LIKE TO SEE IT
VERY WELL THEN I AM QUITE CERTAIN YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FALSEHOOD SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR WORK ELSIE I CAN FORGIVE ANYTHING BUT FALSEHOOD BUT THAT I NEVER WILL FORGIVE COME WITH ME I SHALL TEACH YOU TO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO ME AT LEAST IF TO NO ONE ELSE
AND HE IS SUCH A PRECIOUS SAVIOUR SO KIND AND LOVING BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST COME VERY HUMBLY FEELING THAT YOU ARE A GREAT SINNER AND NOT WORTHY TO BE HEARD AND ONLY HOPING TO BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE JESUS DIED THE BIBLE SAYS
SHE SAW THAT IF HE PERMITTED HER TO READ TO HIM FROM GOD'S WORD AS HE SOMETIMES DID IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY PLEASURE IN LISTENING BUT ONLY TO PLEASE HER SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HE EVER PRAYED AND THOUGH HE WENT REGULARLY TO CHURCH
WHILE ELSIE STOOD PALE AND TREMBLING NOT SPEAKING A WORD YOU HUSH EXCLAIMED ARTHUR FIERCELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
VERY TRYING TO THE PATIENCE OF THEIR ATTENDANTS O ELSIE EXCLAIMED CARRY HOWARD
THAN SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY IN PLAY ELSIE DID KEENLY ENJOY THAT QUIET HOUR SPENT IN STUDYING AND RECITING TO HER FATHER SITTING ON A LOW STOOL AT HIS FEET OR PERHAPS OFTENER ON HIS KNEE WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST
OLE KATE SHE'S GOT A LAME FOOT
BUT AT LENGTH IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE HAD BEEN INTO ELSIE'S ROOM TO GET THE BOOK HE MIGHT BE SUSPECTED AND HE STARTED UP WITH THE INTENTION OF REPLACING IT BUT HE FOUND THAT IT WAS TOO LATE SHE HAD ALREADY RETURNED FOR HE HEARD HER VOICE IN THE HALL
ARTHUR DID NOT DO IT IT WAS I
AND IF SO WHAT IT IS ELSIE BLUSHED AND LOOKED DOWN THEN RAISING HER EYES AND SEEING WITH WHAT A TENDER LOVING GLANCE HE WAS REGARDING HER SHE TOOK COURAGE TO SAY YES PAPA THERE IS ONE THING I WOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER
RETURNED TO THE NURSERY WITHOUT HAVING MET ANY ONE HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON A COUCH AND TRIED TO READ BUT IN VAIN HE COULD NOT FIX HIS ATTENTION UPON THE PAGE
AS SHE HASTILY SET DOWN HER BROOM AND CAME TOWARD THE BED WITH A LOOK OF LOVING ANXIETY ON HER DARK FACE OH NO MAMMY I SLEPT NICELY AND FEEL AS WELL AS CAN BE REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL
NO I WILL NOT HE REPLIED SMILING AT HER EAGERNESS
SHE HELD UP HER FACE FOR A KISS WHICH HE GAVE I WISH I COULD ALWAYS BE GOOD PAPA SHE SAID BUT I AM NAUGHTY SO OFTEN NO SAID HE I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
AND THE RELIEF WAS SO GREAT THAT FOR ONCE SHE SCARCELY HEEDED HER FATHER'S REBUKE ANOTHER HALF HOUR PASSED AND MISTER DINSMORE STILL SAT READING TAKING NO NOTICE OF ELSIE WHO AFRAID TO SPEAK OR MOVE WAS GROWING VERY WEARY AND SLEEPY
AND THE MOMENT SHE HAD FINISHED HE ROSE AND AGAIN TAKING HER HAND LED HER FROM THE ROOM SAYING AS HE DID SO YOU MUST REPEAT THIS STORY TO YOUR GRANDFATHER O PAPA MUST I WON'T YOU TELL HIM PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO IT SHE PLEADED TREMBLINGLY AND HANGING BACK
AND ELSIE STOOD BESIDE HIM PALE AS DEATH TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED EVEN TO CRY AND TREMBLING SO THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY STAND HE TURNED AN ANGRY GLANCE ON HIS SISTER AS SHE ENTERED BUT TAKING NO NOTICE OF IT SHE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY HORACE
THIS IS A TURBAN FOR AUNT PHILLIS AND THIS IS A POUND OF TOBACCO FOR OLD UNCLE JACK AND A NICE PIPE TOO LOOK MAMMY WON'T HE BE PLEASED
WAS BEGINNING TO BE A GOOD DEAL FEARFUL OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS MISCONDUCT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON FOR HIS BROTHER'S WRATH WAS NOW FULLY AROUSED AND HE WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BOY SHOULD NOT ON THIS OCCASION ESCAPE THE PENALTY OF HIS MISDEEDS
YES I DO SHE ANSWERED AND IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK OUT AT ONCE I SHALL SAVE ELSIE AND FIND MEANS TO PROVE YOUR GUILT AFTERWARDS
MISSUS BROWN THE HOUSEKEEPER TAKING THE HEAD OF THE TABLE FOR THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THEM IN ORDER AND SEEING THAT THEIR WANTS WERE WELL SUPPLIED ELSIE CAME IN TO BREAKFAST FROM A BRISK WALK WITH HER PAPA LOOKING FRESH AND ROSY AND BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE ASKED LOOKING KEENLY INTO HER FACE JUST AS I KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU PAPA OR ANY ONE ELSE SHE REPLIED LIFTING HER EYES TO HIS FACE IN EVIDENT SURPRISE AT THE STRANGENESS OF THE QUESTION
I HAVE BEEN CRUELLY UNJUST TO YOU HAVE I NOT DEAR PAPA YOU THOUGHT I DESERVED IT SHE SAID WITH A BURST OF TEARS AND SOBS THROWING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND LAYING HER HEAD ON HIS BREAST
ADELAIDE SCARCELY LESS ALARMED WHILE ENNA CLUNG TO HER SOBBING MOST BITTERLY ELSIE ALONE PRESERVED A CHEERFUL SERENITY SHE HAD BUILT HER HOUSE UPON THE ROCK AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD STAND HER DESTINY WAS IN HER HEAVENLY FATHER'S HANDS
AND I WAS VERY NEAR GIVING MY POOR INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL THE WHIPPING YOU SO RICHLY DESERVE ARTHUR LOOKED UP IN ASTONISHMENT WHO TOLD YOU HE ASKED NOBODY SAW ME THEN CATCHING HIMSELF SAID HASTILY I TELL YOU I DIDN'T DO IT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
WHO PASSED IN AND OUT WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY AND IMPORTANCE AND GENERALLY LADEN WITH SOME ODD LOOKING BUNDLE WHEN GOING IN WHICH THEY INVARIABLY LEFT BEHIND ON COMING OUT AGAIN AND MANY A WHISPERED CONSULTATION HAD BEEN HELD AS TO WHAT WAS PROBABLY GOING ON IN THERE
ELSIE CHANGE SEATS WITH ME
IT IS TRUE WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING GOOD OF OURSELVES WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WE CAN DO NOTHING RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE SO VERY WICKED BUT THEN WE CAN ALWAYS GET THAT HELP IF WE ASK FOR IT JESUS SAID
FOR THOUGH HE WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HE DOES NOT DENY IT AH YES AND NOW I RECOLLECT
THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHECK THROWING THEM UPON THEIR HAUNCHES AND BRINGING THE CARRIAGE TO AN INSTANT STAND STILL THANK GOD WE ARE SAVED THAT FELLOW SHALL BE WELL REWARDED FOR HIS BRAVE DEED EXCLAIMED MISTER DINSMORE THROWING OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR
SAID THE ELDER GENTLEMAN WITH ALMOST FIERCE DETERMINATION AS HE TIGHTENED HIS GRASP UPON THE BOY'S ARM AND DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM ARTHUR CAST A LOOK OF HATRED AND DEFIANCE AT ELSIE AS HE WENT OUT THAT MADE HER GROW PALE WITH FEAR AND TREMBLE SO THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY STAND
AND IT WAS THEN QUITE FREE FROM BLOTS A GREAT CHANGE HAD COME OVER HER BROTHER'S COUNTENANCE WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING THANK YOU LORA HE SAID CORDIALLY AS SOON AS SHE HAD DONE YOU HAVE QUITE CONVINCED ME AND SAVED ME FROM PUNISHING ELSIE AS UNJUSTLY AS SEVERELY
THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDE O PAPA IF YOU WOULD ONLY LOVE ME THE LAST WORD WAS ALMOST A SOB I DO MY DARLING MY OWN PRECIOUS CHILD HE SAID CARESSING HER AGAIN AND AGAIN I DO LOVE MY LITTLE GIRL
I WISH PAPA KNEW HOW LITTLE I REALLY DESERVED IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I NEVER CAN GET THE COURAGE TO TELL HIM THEN LAYING IT ASIDE SHE OPENED HER COPY BOOK AND TURNED OVER THE LEAVES WITH UNALLOYED PLEASURE FOR NOT ONE OF ITS PAGES WAS DEFACED BY A SINGLE BLOT
HER BLUE EYES OPENED WIDE WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN ELSIE QUIETLY REPLIED THAT HER PAPA HAD KINDLY ARRANGED TO GIVE HER AN HOUR EVERY MORNING
BUT OH ELSIE IF YOU CAN ONLY TELL ME HOW TO BE A CHRISTIAN I MEAN NOW TO TRY VERY HARD INDEED I AM DETERMINED NEVER TO REST UNTIL I AM ONE OH LORA HOW GLAD I AM CRIED ELSIE JOYFULLY
BUT COWED BY HIS BROTHER'S DETERMINED LOOK AND MANNER HE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OBEYED NOW SIR SAID MISTER DINSMORE WHEN HE HAD HIM FAIRLY IN THE ROOM AND HAD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM I WISH TO KNOW HOW YOU CAME TO MEDDLE WITH ELSIE'S COPY BOOK
YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS MORE WILLING TO GIVE HIS HOLY SPIRIT TO THEM THAT ASK HIM THAN PARENTS ARE TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS UNTO THEIR CHILDREN OH LORA DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR IT DON'T BE AFRAID TO COME TO JESUS FOR HE SAYS
MUST IT ALWAYS BE THUS WAS HER CRAVING FOR AFFECTION NEVER TO BE SATISFIED O PAPA MY OWN PAPA WILL YOU NEVER LOVE ME MOURNED THE SAD LITTLE HEART AH IF I COULD ONLY BE GOOD ALWAYS PERHAPS HE WOULD
SHE HASTILY CROSSED THE ROOM AND SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE SAID ARTHUR YOU HAVE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUSINESS I VERY WELL KNOW NOW CONFESS IT QUICKLY OR HORACE WILL HALF KILL ELSIE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID HE DOGGEDLY
IN THAT HOUR JESUS REJOICED IN SPIRIT AND SAID I THANK THEE O FATHER LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT THOU HAST HID THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND HAST REVEALED THEM UNTO BABES EVEN SO FATHER FOR SO IT SEEMED GOOD IN THY SIGHT
AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES FORMING CHARMING SAUNTERING GROUNDS FROM WHICH THE GLORIOUS MOUNTAINS MAY BE ENJOYED AS THEY LOOK DOWN IN DIVINE SERENITY OVER THE DARK FORESTS THAT CLOTHE THEIR BASES
AT LENGTH ALL THEIR PLANS PERFECTED TUFTED FLAKES AND SINGLE STARRY CRYSTALS COME IN SIGHT SOLEMNLY SWIRLING AND GLINTING TO THEIR BLESSED APPOINTED PLACES
HORNBLENDE FELDSPAR GRANITE ZIRCON TOURMALINE ET CETERA WEATHERED OUT AND STREWN CLOSELY AND LOOSELY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BROADCAST THEIR RADIANCE IS FAIRLY DAZZLING IN SUNLIGHT
GILIAS PHLOXES MIMULUS ET CETERA MANY OF THEM WITH MORE PETALS THAN LEAVES ON THE BORDERS OF LITTLE STREAMS LARGER PLANTS FLOURISH LUPINES DAISIES ASTERS GOLDENRODS
TO THE SEA BUT THOUGH SNOW DUST AND STORM WINDS ABOUND ON THE MOUNTAINS REGULAR SHAPELY BANNERS ARE FOR CAUSES WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SELDOM PRODUCED
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
SWEEPING IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES FROM THE HOLLOWS AND CANYONS
AVALANCHES ARE SHORT LIVED FEW OF THEM LASTING MORE THAN A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE SHARP CLASHING SOUNDS SO COMMON IN FALLING WATER ARE MOSTLY WANTING
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
A SHORT DISTANCE EAST OF PORCUPINE FLAT FROM THAT POINT PUSH STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT MOUNT HOFFMAN IS A MASS OF GRAY GRANITE THAT RISES ALMOST IN THE CENTER OF THE YOSEMITE PARK
WE COME WITHIN A FEW MILES TO THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH
AND SOON THE BUSY THRONG FILLS THE SKY AND MAKES DARKNESS LIKE NIGHT THE FIRST HEAVY FALL IS USUALLY FROM ABOUT TWO TO FOUR FEET IN DEPTH THEN WITH INTERVALS OF DAYS OR WEEKS OF BRIGHT WEATHER
AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE BY THE LONG CYLINDRICAL CONES DEPENDING LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE LONG BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
OF ALL THE WORLD'S EIGHTY OR NINETY SPECIES OF PINE TREES THE SUGAR PINE PINUS LAMBERTIANA IS KING SURPASSING ALL OTHERS NOT MERELY IN SIZE BUT IN LORDLY BEAUTY AND MAJESTY
AND DOWN ITS FINE GRADES TO THE VALLEY ENJOYING GLORIOUS YOSEMITE SCENERY ALL THE WAY TO THE FOOT OF EL CAPITAN AND YOUR CAMP TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
OR IN STRATIFIED SHEETS IN THE GLACIER CIRQUES SOME OF IT TO REPLENISH THE SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS AND REMAIN SILENT AND RIGID FOR CENTURIES BEFORE IT IS FINALLY MELTED AND SENT SINGING DOWN HOME
ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT IN SOME PLACES AFTER SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TO WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNDOWN I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT THEN MY HOPES WERE REDUCED
LIKE ARTIFICIAL EMBANKMENTS COVERED WITH A MAGNIFICENT GROWTH OF SILVER FIR AND PINE BUT THIS GARDEN AND FOREST LUXURIANCE IS SPEEDILY LEFT BEHIND
RUNNING CRYSTAL CLEAR DEEP AND FULL BUT NOT OVERFLOWING THEIR BANKS ABOUT AS DEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE DAY THE DIFFERENCE IN VOLUME SO MARKED IN SPRING BEING NOW TOO SLIGHT TO BE NOTICED
FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
SAUNTERING UP THE VALLEY THROUGH MEADOW AND GROVE IN THE COMPANY OF THESE MAJESTIC ROCKS WHICH SEEM TO FOLLOW US AS WE ADVANCE GAZING ADMIRING LOOKING FOR NEW WONDERS AHEAD WHERE ALL ABOUT US IS SO WONDERFUL
AWAKENING THE LAKES AND CRYSTALS
WHICH HAVE BEEN FILLED UP BY DEPOSITS FROM THE RIVER A FEW OF THESE RIVER LAKES STILL EXIST BUT THEY ARE NOW SHALLOW AND ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING EXTINCTION
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
AND THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE ROCKS ESPECIALLY THE HALF DOME AND THE UPPER PART OF THE NORTH WALL ARE VERY FINE BUT OF COURSE FAR THE MOST IMPOSING VIEW IS THE VAST ARRAY OF SNOWY PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
THE GROVES ABOUT THE SODA SPRINGS ARE FAVORITE CAMPING GROUNDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD PLEASANT TASTING WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID AND BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE MEADOW THE GLACIER MONUMENT CATHEDRAL PEAK
IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
WERE THE MOST INTERESTING OF THEM ALL THE PATH OF THE VANISHED GLACIER SHONE IN MANY PLACES AS IF WASHED WITH SILVER AND PUSHING UP THE CANYON ON THIS BRIGHT ROAD I PASSED LAKE AFTER LAKE IN SOLID BASINS OF GRANITE
WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
AND THE COAST RANGES HAZY AND DIM IN THE DISTANCE FROM GLACIER POINT GO DOWN THE TRAIL INTO THE LOWER END OF THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN CROSS ILLILOUETTE CREEK AND FOLLOW IT TO THE FALL
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF THIS NEW HISTORY HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE FORTUNES AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF LADY EUSTACE THE HISTORIAN BEGS HIS READERS NOT TO BELIEVE
IN A RIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CORSAIR WAS ALL THAT A CORSAIR SHOULD BE BUT KNOWING AS SHE DID BUT VERY LITTLE OF THE CORSAIR SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO THROW OVER HER COUSIN FOR HIS SAKE
BUT I AM NOT SURE THAT I REMEMBER THE NAME QUITE RIGHTLY I HOPE I MAY SEE YOU THERE SOME DAY AND THE DEAR BISHOP I LOOK FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO DOING SOMETHING TO MAKE THOSE DEAR IRISH HAPPIER
THEN SHE WENT AND HE RETURNED TO A ROOM BELOW WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR PURPOSES OF TOBACCO AND SODA WATER AND BRANDY WHY GRIFF YOU'RE RATHER OUT OF SORTS TO NIGHT SAID LORD GEORGE TO HIS FRIEND
ALTOGETHER MY OWN SIR FLORIAN GAVE THEM TO ME WHEN HE PUT THEM INTO MY HANDS HE SAID THAT THEY WERE TO BE MY OWN FOR EVER AND EVER THERE SAID HE
SHE DID NOT LOOK INTO HIS FACE AS SHE ASKED THIS QUESTION BUT STOOD WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE STAIR CARPET INDEED NO GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT LIZZIE
IN THE CORNERS OF WHICH IT WOULD ALWAYS SEEM THAT A DIAMOND OF A TEAR WAS LURKING WHENEVER ANY MATTER OF EXCITEMENT WAS AFOOT HER LIGHT BROWN HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND PRETTY AS HAIR IT WAS VERY WELL BUT IT HAD NO SPECIALITY
BUT THEN LADY FAWN HATED LADY LINLITHGOW AS ONLY TWO OLD WOMEN CAN HATE EACH OTHER AND SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE STORY OF THE DIAMOND NECKLACE LUCY MORRIS CERTAINLY WAS A TREASURE A TREASURE THOUGH NO HEROINE
SHE DID IN TRUTH DESPISE HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT CLUTCH THE JEWELS SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS MEAN AND PALTRY BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO SUBMIT TO MISTER CAMPERDOWN BUT STILL SHE WAS PROMPTED TO DEMAND
WHEN LORD FAWN TOOK HIS LEAVE
SHE WAS A SWEETLY SOCIAL GENIAL LITTLE HUMAN BEING WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS EVER FELT TO BE LIKE SUNSHINE SHE WAS NEVER FORWARD BUT NEVER BASHFUL SHE WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITHOUT EVER PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD
COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS THEY DON'T DO MUCH GOOD DO THEY IT'S BETTER TO TAKE PEOPLE AS YOU FIND EM AND THEN MAKE THE BEST OF EM THEY'RE A QUEER LOT AIN'T THEY THE SORT OF PEOPLE ONE MEETS ABOUT IN THE WORLD
AS FAR AS SHE KNEW THE CORSAIR HAD NOT EVEN AN ISLAND OF HIS OWN IN THE AEGEAN SEA AND IF HE HAD MIGHT NOT THE ISLAND TOO PROBABLY HAVE A MEDORA OR TWO OF ITS OWN
THE DEAN AND THE DEAN'S WIFE AND THE DEAN'S DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN HER BEST FRIENDS BUT THEY WERE NOT FRIENDS ON WHOM SHE COULD BE DEPENDENT THEY WERE IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH HER BY BLOOD
ACRID THAN THAT WRITTEN TO HER AUNT LINLITHGOW MY DEAR MISSUS EUSTACE I HOPE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM ME AND WILL NOT BE SORRY TO HEAR MY NEWS
YOU ARE NO MORE THAN A CHILD TO ME BUT YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I HOPE I HAVE NOT INJURED YOU LORD GEORGE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU RODE TO HOUNDS THE DAY YOUR COUSIN TOOK THAT OTHER MAN'S HORSE THAT SURPRISED ME
FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING TO YOU THAT SURPRISED ME I MEANT TO BE SO KIND TO YOU ALL AND WHEN I FOUND THAT YOU ALWAYS TRAVELLED WITH TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF DIAMONDS IN A BOX THAT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH
THOUSAND POUNDS SHE REPLIED TEN THOUSAND POUNDS LORD FAWN RIVETED HIS EYES UPON THEM THAT'S WHAT I AM TOLD BY A JEWELLER
OUGHT THEY IF YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED BEFORE AND YOUR WIFE HAD GIVEN YOU A KEEPSAKE TO KEEP FOR EVER AND EVER WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP TO A LAWYER YOU WOULD NOT LIKE IT WOULD YOU FREDERIC SHE HAD PUT HER HAND ON HIS
HER MARRIAGE WITH SIR FLORIAN HAD BEEN TRIUMPHANT BUT THAT WAS ONLY A STEP TO SOMETHING GOOD THAT WAS TO COME AFTER SHE THEN HAD AT HER OWN DISPOSAL HER LITTLE WITS AND HER PRETTINESS
LORD FAWN WAS A LORD AND EVEN COMMONERS WERE IN THE CABINET OF COURSE HE IS SAID LIZZIE BUT I SHA'N'T HAVE MY DRAWING ROOM MADE A CABINET THEY SHA'N'T COME HERE AND THEN AGAIN ON THE TUESDAY EVENING
IF IT WOULD BE A HOPE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A HOPE I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL BUT I WILL NEVER SAY ANY SUCH WORD TO HER
BUT TILL THAT BLESSED TIME HAS COME
EVERY WAY AND AS FOR MYSELF I HAVE FELT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HOW UNFITTED I HAVE BEEN TO MANAGE EVERYTHING MYSELF I HAVE THEREFORE ACCEPTED AN OFFER MADE TO ME
THAT IT WAS SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE VALUE OF THE STONES DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WORTH HE ASKED LIZZIE
BUT WHO WAS NEVERTHELESS A CLEVER DILIGENT WELL INSTRUCTED MAN
THAT I HAVE VENTURED TO SPEAK TO YOU I AM SURE THERE IS NOTHING YOU WOULD WISH SO MUCH AS TO GET AT THE TRUTH CERTAINLY LADY GLENCORA ALL MANNER OF STORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT HER
NOW LUCY DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR THE GREYSTOCKS ABUSED AND WOULD SAY SO THAT'S ALL VERY WELL YOU LITTLE MINX LIZZIE WOULD SAY PLAYFULLY
SHE HAD PLANNED THE NEW FLOWER GARDEN
DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY BE SAID LIZZIE TRYING TO BRING HER MIND TO WORK UPON THE SUBJECT STEADILY MISTER CAMPERDOWN HAS BEEN VERY UNCOURTEOUS TO ME I MUST SAY THAT AND AS I THINK UNFAIR
AH DEAR I HAVE KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS LIZZIE AND THAT BOTH COVERS AND DISCOVERS MANY FAULTS ONE LEARNS TO KNOW HOW BAD ONE'S OLD FRIENDS ARE BUT THEN ONE FORGIVES THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE OLD FRIENDS YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ME
BY WHAT JEWELLER A MAN HAD TO COME AND SEE THEM ABOUT SOME REPAIRS OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND POOR SIR FLORIAN WISHED IT
MISTER GOWRAN PERCEIVED THAT FRANK WAS A GENTLEMAN AND WAS DISAPPOINTED
HER OWN TO DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY FIND OUT THE TRUTH FROM OTHER SOURCES BEFORE HE MARRIED HER INDEED SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE HERSELF
BUT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING ABOUT A SECOND SON AND THERE WAS NO SECOND SON PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE A SECOND SON YET A FUTURE LITTLE LORD FAWN AND HE MIGHT INHERIT IT IN REGARD TO HONESTY
FOR THE RECOVERY OF JEWELS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN BY SIR FLORIAN HIMSELF TO HIS WIFE AS A KEEPSAKE PERHAPS SIR FLORIAN HAD MADE SOME MISTAKE
THE CORSAIR WAS A VERY FINE SPECIMEN OF THE CORSAIR BREED ABOUT THE BEST CORSAIR SHE HAD EVER SEEN AND HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO HER FOR THE DAY BUT THESE CORSAIRS ARE KNOWN TO BE DANGEROUS
SO I AM AT PORTRAY CASTLE AT LAST HE SAID STILL HOLDING HER HAND YES AT THE DULLEST DREARIEST DEADLIEST SPOT IN ALL CHRISTENDOM I THINK IF AYRSHIRE BE CHRISTENDOM BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT NOW PERHAPS
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF LUCY MORRIS AND TREATED HER DEPENDENT WITH AFFECTIONATE CONSIDERATION BUT SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF VISITS FROM MISTER FRANK GREYSTOCK LUCY BLUSHING UP TO THE EYES
THE IDEA OF RAMBLING UP INTO OUR OWN MOUNTAINS CHARMS ME FOR NOTHING SUITS MY DISPOSITION SO WELL AS THAT KIND OF SOLITUDE OF COURSE LORD FAWN IS NOT SO RICH A MAN AS SIR FLORIAN
THAT IS EVERYTHING I CARE NOTHING FOR MISTER CAMPERDOWN NOR YET FOR MISTER DOVE IF THAT IS HIS ABSURD NAME LORD FAWN IS OF MORE MOMENT TO ME THOUGH INDEED HE HAS GIVEN ME BUT LITTLE CAUSE TO SAY SO
AND WHERE I'M NOT BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THE FIRST AND THE LAST VISIT AND AS FOR BRINGING THOSE DOWDY GIRLS OUT IN LONDON IT'S THE LAST THING I SHALL THINK OF DOING INDEED I DOUBT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO DRESS THEMSELVES
I WOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH IF ANYBODY WERE THE BETTER FOR IT
AND THE POOR DEPENDANT THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE TURNED OUT INTO THE STREET HAD CONGRATULATED HER PATRONESS THE VULTURESS WILL
HER MOUTH WAS SOMEWHAT LARGE BUT FULL OF EVER VARYING EXPRESSION HER FOREHEAD WAS LOW AND BROAD WITH PROMINENT TEMPLES ON WHICH IT WAS HER HABIT TO CLASP TIGHTLY HER LITTLE OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS AS SHE SAT LISTENING TO YOU
THROUGH A GAP IN A CERTAIN WALL WHICH LAY HALF WAY BETWEEN THE COTTAGE AND THE CASTLE HE WAS THINKING OF THE WORK IN HAND
NOR DOES THE CHRONICLER DARE TO PUT FORWARD LUCY MORRIS AS A HEROINE
THEREFORE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHE HAD GONE OUT TO BE A CHILD'S GOVERNESS THEN OLD LADY FAWN HAD HEARD OF HER VIRTUES LADY FAWN WHO HAD SEVEN UNMARRIED DAUGHTERS RUNNING DOWN FROM SEVEN AND TWENTY TO THIRTEEN
I SUPPOSE THE LAWYERS WILL DO THAT SAID MISS MACNULTY YES LAWYERS THAT'S ALL VERY WELL I KNOW WHAT LAWYERS ARE
WILL YOU BRING HER TO SEE ME AGAIN YES AUNT IF SHE WANTS TO COME BUT DON'T ASK ME TO LEAVE HER AGAIN WELL IF YOU CAN'T STAY WITH ME OR TRUST HER YOURSELF LET MISTER VANILLA COME AND STAND GUARD OVER US BOTH
NO MISS STEVENS I THINK IT NEVER WAS HE REPLIED OFFERING THE OTHER ARM TO ROSE SHE WAS GOING TO DECLINE IT ON THE PLEA THAT THE PATH WAS TOO NARROW FOR THREE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND AND ACCEPT AND THEY MOVED ON
THEN THE TRAIN CAME THUNDERING UP AND THE FAIR GIRL WAS HURRIED INTO IT MISTER TRAVILLA ON ONE SIDE AND HER FATHER ON THE OTHER EFFECTUALLY PREVENTING ANY NEAR APPROACH TO HER PERSON ON THE PART OF THE BAFFLED AND DISAPPOINTED FORTUNE HUNTER
YOU HAVE BROKEN HIS LAW AND HIS JUSTICE DEMANDS YOUR PUNISHMENT
I THINK YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COMMAND TO BE COURTEOUS PAPA SHE SAID LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW YOU COULD BE SO VERY POLITE TO MISS STEVENS
AND WITH A HEART FULL OF DEEP PASSIONATE LOVE FOR HER HER FATHER UNDERSTOOD AND SYMPATHIZED WITH IT ALL HE PASSED HIS ARM ABOUT HER WAIST DREW HER CLOSER TO HIM
IT MUST HAVE COST A PRETTY PENNY THE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS ALONE MUST BE WORTH QUITE A SUM HE SAID TURNING IT ABOUT AND EXAMINING IT WITH EAGER INTEREST I WOULD BE CAREFUL MISS DINSMORE
AND WAIT PATIENTLY AND HOPEFULLY TOO SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE FOR IF MISTER EGERTON IS REALLY GOOD NO DOUBT IT WILL BE PROVED IN TIME AND THEN YOUR FATHER WILL AT ONCE REMOVE HIS INTERDICT AND IF YOU ARE MISTAKEN
AS AT THE RECOVERY OF A LONG LOST PRECIOUS TREASURE YOU SHALL NEVER GO AWAY AGAIN SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW HUGGING HER TIGHT WHEN A BOY HAS ONLY ONE SISTER HE CAN'T SPARE HER TO OTHER FOLKS CAN HE PAPA
I AM GLAD YOU ARE PLEASED WITH IT DAUGHTER RETURNED MISTER DINSMORE OPENING THE MORNING PAPER WHICH JOHN HAD JUST BROUGHT UP THEY
AND HE WILL HAVE MERCY UPON HIM AND TO OUR GOD FOR HE WILL ABUNDANTLY PARDON THE MAN WAS AN ARRANT KNAVE AND HYPOCRITE SIMULATING ANXIETY ABOUT HIS SOUL'S SALVATION ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH ELSIE BUT
HE CARRIED ON NUMEROUS SMALL FLIRTATIONS AMONG THE BELLES OF THE PLACE YET PAID COURT TO ELSIE MUCH OFTENER THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE USING EVERY ART OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER IN THE DETERMINED EFFORT TO WIN HER AFFECTION AND TO MAKE HIMSELF NECESSARY TO HER HAPPINESS HE HAD READ MANY BOOKS AND SEEN MUCH OF LIFE
ABOUT WHAT A SPLENDID MATCH MISS STEVENS IS GOING TO MAKE AND MAMMA WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW IT AND HOW YOU WOULD LIKE HER AND PAPA SAID HE THOUGHT MISTER DINSMORE WOULDN'T THINK MUCH OF HER IF HE KNEW HOW SHE FLIRTED AND DANCED UNTIL HE CAME
HE ALWAYS BUYS MY DRESSES HIMSELF AND SAYS HOW THEY ARE TO BE MADE THE DRESSMAKER WANTED TO PUT MORE FLOUNCES ON BUT PAPA DIDN'T WANT THEM AND NEITHER DID I HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE LITTLE GIRLS LOADED WITH FINERY
IT WILL BE MOONLIGHT NEXT WEEK SAID SOPHY AND WE'LL HAVE SOME DELIGHTFUL DRIVES AND WALKS ALONG THE BEACH THE SEA DOES LOOK SO LOVELY BY MOONLIGHT
AND DO YOU THINK MY OWN MAMMA WOULD LIKE IT IF MISS ALLISON CONSENTS TO TAKE A MOTHER'S PLACE TO YOU I AM SURE YOUR OWN MAMMA IF SHE COULD SPEAK TO YOU WOULD TELL YOU SHE DESERVED TO HAVE THE TITLE
MISS STEVENS HAD FROM THE FIRST CONCEIVED A GREAT ANTIPATHY TO ROSE WHOM SHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS RIVAL AND GENERALLY AVOIDED EXCEPTING WHEN MISTER DINSMORE WAS WITH HER BUT SHE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED A TETE A TETE
NO SON ANSWERED MISTER DINSMORE PATTING HIS ROSY CHEEK AND SOFTLY STROKING ELSIE'S HAIR AND IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH A MAN WHO HAS BUT ONE DAUGHTER YOU DON'T LOOK BRIGHT AND MERRY AS YOU DID WHEN YOU WENT AWAY
HE FOUND ARTHUR NEARLY RECOVERED AND AT ONCE ASKED A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE AFFAIR OF TOM JACKSON ALIAS BROMLY EGERTON HIS DESIGNS UPON ELSIE AND ARTHUR'S PARTICIPATION IN THEM I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
MY REPLY SHALL BE SHORT AND SWEET AND QUITE TO THE POINT IT RAN THUS YOUR WARNING AND ADVICE COME TOO LATE MY YOUNG FRIEND
COGITO ERGO SUM SHE ANSWERED GAYLY ALSO I AM SURE WE HAVE HAD A VERY PLEASANT WALK BUT ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE MOVING TOWARD HOME YES ELSIE ANSWERED CONSULTING HER WATCH THAT'S A PRETTY LITTLE THING OBSERVED EGERTON MAY I LOOK AT IT
AND CONTRIVING SO MANY FRESH ENTERTAINMENTS THAT DURING THOSE FEW WEEKS LIFE SEEMED LIKE ONE LONG GALA DAY MISTER TRAVILLA WAS WITH THEM MOST OF THE TIME HE HAD TARRIED BEHIND IN PHILADELPHIA AS MISTER DINSMORE AND HIS DAUGHTER PASSED THROUGH
MISTER AND MISSUS DINSMORE WERE STILL YOUTHFUL IN THEIR FEELINGS AND JOINED WITH GREAT ZEST IN THE SPORTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE GOING WITH THEM IN ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN ALL THEIR PASTIMES
YOU WILL INEVITABLY FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR END HE SAID ELSIE WILL NEVER MARRY WITHOUT HER FATHER'S CONSENT AND THAT YOU WILL FIND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GAIN HORACE IS TOO SHARP TO BE HOODWINKED OR DECEIVED EVEN BY YOU
AH NO MATTER I WOULDN'T HAVE HER DISTURBED FOR THE WORLD AND IN FACT I AM RATHER GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING YOU ALONE I
AND THAT WHOM THE LORD LOVETH HE CHASTENETH AND SCOURGETH EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVETH IF YE BE WITHOUT CHASTISEMENTS WHEREOF ALL ARE PARTAKERS THEN ARE YE BASTARDS AND NO SONS
IT IS ITS VERY SIMPLICITY THAT SO STUMBLES WISE MEN AND WOMEN WHILE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THEIR SWEET TRUSTFULNESS
AH THERE IS MISS ROSE LOOKING FOR ME I MUST GO
AS SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THEIR RETURN FROM THEIR WALK WHAT MY DEAR WHY PAPA I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A NICE TIME AND SHE JUST SPOILED IT ALL SHE WHO DAUGHTER
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE SUCH AN ASSERTION AS YOU HAVE JUST MADE WITH THE FACT OF YOUR HAVING THAT LETTER IN YOUR POSSESSION I SAY IT'S A COWARDLY PIECE OF BUSINESS FOR YOU TO GIVE THE LIE TO A FELLOW THAT HASN'T THE STRENGTH TO KNOCK YOU DOWN FOR IT
YOU MAY AS WELL SPEAK THE TRUTH SIR IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER FOR YOU IN THE END SAID MISTER DINSMORE STERNLY HIS EYES FLASHING WITH INDIGNANT ANGER
I'D BE HAPPY SIR AT ANY TIME WHEN YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT FOR ME TO SEE YOU HERE WITH HORACE AND THE CHILD OR WITHOUT THEM THANK YOU MISS STANHOPE AND MOTHER AND I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU AT ION
HE WROTE TO ARTHUR THAT THE PRIZE WAS NEARLY WON SO NEARLY THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS AND I'LL NOT BE LONG NOW ABOUT FINISHING UP THE JOB HE CONTINUED IT'S SUCH PRECIOUS HARD WORK TO BE SO GOOD AND PIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT I CAN HARDLY WAIT TILL MATTERS ARE FULLY RIPE FOR ACTION
A GOODLY APPLE ROTTEN AT THE HEART O WHAT A GOODLY OUTSIDE FALSEHOOD HATH SHAKESPEARE'S MERCHANT OF VENICE
IT WOULD BE SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HER NO MY DEAR IT WOULDN'T DO HE REPLIED WITH A GRAVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHY PAPA SHE ASKED WITH A LOOK OF KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAID IN THE SAME GRAVE TONE
IS THE CARE YOU SPEAK OF ONE THING OF WHICH YOU FEEL CERTAIN YES AND THERE ARE OTHERS MAY I ASK WHAT SHE TURNED HER SWEET SOFT EYES FULL UPON HIM AS SHE ANSWERED IN LOW CLEAR TONES I KNOW THAT IN ME THAT IS IN MY FLESH
OF HIS NEVER FAILING LOVE TO HER AND OF THE MANY GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES OF HIS WORD SHE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD SAID YOUR FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF ALL THESE THINGS
AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
WHO HAD COME TO THE VERANDA WHERE SHE AND MISS STEVENS HAD BEEN STANDING TO TELL HER THAT THEY WERE GOING OUT TO WALK AND HER PAPA WISHED TO TAKE HER ALONG ELSIE WENT IN TO GET HER HAT AND MISS STEVENS CAME TOWARDS ROSE SAYING
WHICH WAS IN THE SECOND STORY AND OPENED UPON A VERANDA SHADED BY TALL TREES AND OVERLOOKING A LARGE GRASSY YARD AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BEYOND WERE GREEN FIELDS WOODS AND HILLS
AND CONTENT TO BEAR THE CROSS HE HAD SENT HER
THE DEAR CHILD MY HEART ACHES FOR HER HE REMARKED TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT OUT TOGETHER AND I FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE YET TO FORGIVE EITHER THAT SCOUNDREL JACKSON OR MY BROTHER ARTHUR
IS PROVIDED FOR BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MISTER JEFFREY PAID HIS RENT PERSONALLY AND PREMATURELY TO THE PORTER ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MARCH THUS ESTABLISHING BEYOND QUESTION THE FACT THAT HE WAS ALIVE ON THAT DATE AND YET FURTHER
WHEN MISTER STEPHEN WAS GONE JERVIS AND I LOOKED OVER THE CHAMBERS THOROUGHLY AND THEN ANOTHER CURIOUS FACT CAME TO LIGHT ON THE WALL
LOOKS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE SAME MAN ALIVE I TAKE IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT ACUTENESS ON THE PART OF JOHN BLACKMORE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CALCULATED SO CLEVERLY
WHO WAS HE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE FIND HIM COMMITTING A SECRET CRIME FROM WHICH JOHN BLACKMORE ALONE WILL BENEFIT THIS SUGGESTS
I WILL SAY GOOD NIGHT I HOPE YOU WON'T THINK ME VERY UNCEREMONIOUS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING ME AS I HAVE SAID PROFOUNDLY ASTONISHED THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER ANY BUSINESS
I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER HIM QUITE OUT OF DANGER NOW
GOOD EVENING DOCTOR STILLBURY HE SHOOK HANDS WITH US BOTH GENIALLY AND ACCEPTING PERFORCE THIS VERY POLITE BUT UNMISTAKABLE DISMISSAL WE TOOK OUR DEPARTURE OUTSIDE THE STATION STILLBURY HEAVED A COMFORTABLE SIGH
AND RESEMBLES HER IN THE ONE FEATURE THAT IS UNCHANGEABLE DO YOU KNOW IF HER CHRISTIAN NAME HAPPENS TO BE PAULINE YES IT IS SHE WAS A MISS PAULINE HAGENBECK A MEMBER OF AN AMERICAN THEATRICAL COMPANY WHAT MADE YOU ASK
A MORE MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THEY DESERVED EXCLAIMED STEPHEN WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE MISERY AND SUFFERING THAT THEY INFLICTED ON POOR OLD UNCLE JEFFREY I WOULD SOONER HAVE HAD THEM HANGED IT'S BETTER AS IT IS SIR
HAD NO APPARENT BEARING ON THE CASE ON ARRIVING HOME I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE MESSAGE BOOK AND WAS RELIEVED TO FIND THAT THERE WERE NO FURTHER VISITS TO BE MADE HAVING MADE UP A MIXTURE FOR MISTER GRAVES AND HANDED IT TO THE COACHMAN
IT CONCLUSIVELY DISPROVES WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO PROVE THAT JEFFREY DIED BY HIS OWN HAND YES I SEE THAT SAID STEPHEN AND THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ASKED DID YOU IDENTIFY MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM
WALKED BACK TOWARDS HIS CHAMBERS ACROSS THE SQUARE THE MUD OF WHICH SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN CONSPICUOUS ON HIS SHOES THUS IN A MOMENT A WILDLY SPECULATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAD ASSUMED A HIGH DEGREE OF PROBABILITY
WERE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON AND THAT THAT PERSON WAS JOHN BLACKMORE THAT SAID MISTER WINWOOD IS A VERY PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT BUT YOU OBSERVE SIR THAT IT CONTAINS AN UNDISTRIBUTED MIDDLE TERM
AND FORGED HIS SIGNATURE TO A FALSE WILL SEEMED WILDLY IMPROBABLE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODY BUT IT INVOLVED NO ACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND IT OFFERED A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE
THESE TUBES EACH CONTAINED TWENTY TABLOIDS A THIRTY SECOND OF A GRAIN ALTOGETHER SO WE MAY ASSUME THAT ABOUT TWELVE TIMES THE MEDICINAL DOSE WAS SWALLOWED DEATH MUST HAVE OCCURRED IN A FEW MINUTES AND A MERCIFUL DEATH TOO
OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE COINCIDENCES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED I DID NOT HOWEVER FOR A MOMENT THINK THAT THIS WAS THE TRUE EXPLANATION BUT I RESOLVED TO BEAR IT IN MIND TO TEST IT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE
AN EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA HAD DESCENDED ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WAS GETTING NOT ONLY
MEMBERS OF A CERTAIN BENEFIT CLUB WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE REMARKABLE SUDDENNESS OF THE OUTBREAK OF COURSE MY CONTEMPLATED VISIT TO THORNDYKE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION I SHOULD HAVE TO ACT ON MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY BUT
I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT REPLIED THORNDYKE THEN SAID MARCHMONT WE WILL HEAR THE REST OF THE ARGUMENT IF YOU PLEASE VERY WELL SAID THORNDYKE AS THE EVIDENCE STANDS WE HAVE PROVED THAT JEFFREY BLACKMORE
THE SUGGESTION MET MY VIEWS EXACTLY AS SOON AS WE HAD FINISHED TEA WE SET FORTH
I FOUND THAT ITS CURVE WAS PART OF AN ELLIPSE BUT WATCH GLASSES NOWADAYS ARE INVARIABLY CIRCULAR IN THE SECOND PLACE WATCH GLASSES ARE GROUND ON THE EDGE TO A SINGLE BEVEL TO SNAP INTO THE BEZEL OR FRAME BUT THE EDGE OF THIS OBJECT
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE PECULIAR GRAVELLY MUD THAT ADHERED TO MY OWN BOOTS AND JERVIS'S AND WHICH CAME FROM THE SQUARE OF THE INN YET THE PORTER DISTINCTLY STATED THAT THE DECEASED AFTER PAYING THE RENT
THAT HIS WAS A CHARITABLE RATHER THAN A BUSINESS PROPOSAL NOW THAT I KNEW THIS NOT TO BE THE CASE I WAS IMPATIENT TO JOIN HIM AND AS I TRUDGED THROUGH THE DREARY THOROUGHFARES OF THIS SUPERANNUATED SUBURB WITH ITS ONCE RUSTIC VILLAS AND ITS FADED GARDENS
NOW IT'S OF NO USE FOR YOU TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM SAID PLAYFULLY WE'LL TALK TO YOU TO MORROW GOOD NIGHT DOCTOR I'LL LIGHT YOU DOWN THE STAIRS BUT I WON'T COME DOWN WITH YOU OR THE PATIENT WILL BE FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN
IT HAD STRUCK ME AS SINGULAR THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO COFFEE IN THE HOUSE BUT A SUFFICIENCY OF TEA GERMANS ARE NOT USUALLY TEA DRINKERS AND THEY DO TAKE COFFEE BUT PERHAPS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THIS
THEN I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR CHEQUE AND SETTLE UP EVERYTHING TO NIGHT SO THAT YOU SHALL BE FREE TO GO OFF WHEN YOU LIKE TO MORROW MORNING THUS ENDED MY CONNECTION WITH KENNINGTON LANE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT ABOUT NOON
BUT IT SEEMED RATHER UNNECESSARY TO TAKE A FRESH SET OF NOTES AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I RATHER SHIRKED THE LABOUR TIRED AS I WAS AFTER MY LATE EXERTIONS BESIDES I WANTED TO THINK OVER THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING WHILE THEY WERE FRESH IN MY MEMORY
I WILL GO NOW AND ATTEND TO SOME RATHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT I HAVE HAD TO LEAVE UNFINISHED MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE THAT YOU REQUIRE AND WILL ORDER THE CARRIAGE WHEN YOU THINK IT SAFE TO LEAVE THE PATIENT IN CASE I SHOULD NOT SEE YOU AGAIN
AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE SUPPOSED JEFFREY TO THE PORTER HINTING AT SUICIDE ARE NOW IMPORTANT EVIDENCE BY THE LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED SUICIDE BECOMES THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED MURDER
YOU UNDERSTAND I SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THE DANGER IS NOT OVER IF HE IS LEFT NOW HE WILL FALL ASLEEP AND IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY WILL NEVER WAKE YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT
HE REMARKED IN HIS SCOTCH DIALECT THAT I
THE REMARKABLE SERIES OF COINCIDENCES THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO LIGHT WHEN WE CONSIDER THIS PECULIARITY OF THE DISEASE
THAT VISIT OFFERED QUITE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT CALLED FOR ELUCIDATION THERE WAS THE PATIENT'S CONDITION FOR INSTANCE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS SYMPTOMS WAS SET AT REST BY THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIDOTES
THE OFFICER SMILED FAINTLY AND FIXED AN ABSTRACTED GAZE ON THE CLOCK YOU COULD SIR HE REPLIED I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT YOU COULD I COULDN'T
SH'LIKE TO LIE DOWN NOW F'YOU'D BE S'GOOD YOU MUST WALK ABOUT A LITTLE LONGER MISTER GRAVES I SAID IT WOULD BE VERY BAD FOR YOU TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A CURIOUS
SHE DIED OF CANCER NOW PEOPLE DO NOT DIE SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY OF CANCER THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE STANDS ALMOST ALONE
THE SERVICES OF A STRANGE ASSISTANT I SHOULD LIKE TO GET OFF AS SOON AS YOU CAN SPARE ME I REPLIED BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU IN THE LURCH THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW SAID STILLBURY I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET US HAVE SOME TEA AND DIVIDE UP THE WORK ANYTHING OF INTEREST GOING
WHY COULD HE NOT BE SENT TO FETCH THE COFFEE AND WHY DID NOT HE RATHER THAN THE HOUSEKEEPER COME TO TAKE THE PLACE OF MISTER WEISS WHEN THE LATTER HAD TO GO AWAY THERE WERE OTHER POINTS TOO I RECALLED THE WORD THAT SOUNDED LIKE POL'N
AS IT IS NOT OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO RETURN TO WEISS HE WAS CLEARLY HEAVILY DISGUISED AS WE SEE BY HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO SHOW HIMSELF EVEN BY THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE BUT THERE IS AN ITEM OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT
AND THE MORE HE REVIVED THE MORE ENERGETICALLY DID HE PROTEST AGAINST THIS WEARISOME PERAMBULATION BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY A POLITE GENTLEMAN FOR MUDDLED AS HIS FACULTIES WERE HE MANAGED TO CLOTHE HIS OBJECTIONS IN COURTEOUS
THE NAME WHICH JERVIS HEARD POOR JEFFREY STRUGGLING TO PRONOUNCE SEEMED TO ME TO RESEMBLE PAULINE MORE THAN ANY OTHER NAME THERE IS ONE LITTLE POINT THAT STRIKES ME SAID MARCHMONT IS IT NOT RATHER REMARKABLE THAT THE PORTER
AND WE BOTH SPRINTED HARDER THAN EVER AND JUST HOPPED ON THE FOOT BOARD OF THE GUARD'S VAN AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO GET UP SPEED THE GUARD COULDN'T RISK PUTTING US OFF
MONTHS IN ADVANCE A PERSON WHO HAS AN INCURABLE CANCER IS A PERSON WHOSE DEATH MAY BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY AND ITS DATE FIXED WITHIN COMPARATIVELY NARROW LIMITS AND NOW OBSERVE
I CAUGHT FREQUENT GLIMPSES OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S FACE BUT IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IN PROFILE
HE WAS EVIDENTLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT NO UPHEAVALS WERE TO TAKE PLACE IN HIS DOMAIN I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THEIR ATTITUDE HE SAID AND THEY ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU KNOW THE FUNCTION OF LAW IS TO PREVENT CRIME IT IS TRUE
I WILL READ THE DEPOSITION OVER TO YOU AND IF IT IS CORRECT I WILL ASK YOU TO SIGN IT HE DID SO AND WHEN I HAD SIGNED THE DOCUMENT I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE DONE IN THE MATTER I AM AFRAID HE REPLIED THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ANY ACTIVE MEASURES
WHENCE THE FINDING OF THESE FRAGMENTS OF GLASS IN THE BEDROOM ESTABLISHES A CONSIDERABLE PROBABILITY THAT MISTER WEISS WAS AT SOME TIME IN THE CHAMBERS AT NEW INN AND NOW LET US GATHER UP THE THREADS OF THIS PART OF THE ARGUMENT
BUT IT CLUNG TO MY MEMORY IT HAUNTED ME AND EVER AS IT RETURNED IT BORE WITH IT THE DISQUIETING QUESTIONS WAS MISTER GRAVES STILL ALIVE AND IF HE WAS NOT WAS THERE REALLY NOTHING WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO SAVE HIM
THE CUSTOMARY PATRON OF EVERY LIVELY LAY GO FORTH WITHOUT DELAY THY WONTED ANNUAL WAY TO MEET THE CEREMONIOUS HOLY MATRON HER GRAVE PROCESSION GRACING
WHAT DO I CARE I'LL FIX HIM NEXT TIME
THEN HE PROCEEDED TO MAKE READY THE WEDDING GEAR AND PRESENTLY HE SENT AFTER HIS BROTHER KING SHAH ZAMAN WHO CAME
AND CAUSED HIS UNDERSTANDING TO REVERT AND TURNED TO ALLAH ALMIGHTY AND SAID TO HIMSELF
BOWING LOW AS THE MUSIC SWELLED AND FOLDING HIS SMALL WHITE HANDS UPON HIS BREAST THE SQUIRE'S BARBARA WHO CARRIED A BURNING TAPER WREATHED WITH ROSEMARY HAD GONE BEFORE HIM
AND PUFFED AS IF NINE TENTHS OF THE WEIGHT FELL UPON HIM VALENTINE LIKED TO SEE HIS LITTLE BOY EMPLOYED HE WOULD TELL HIM TO WIND THE TWINE ON THE REEL TO CARRY THE TOOLS WHERE THEY WERE WANTED
WITH THE ZEAL AND DEVOTION OF A SELF SACRIFICING PATRIOT ONCE WHEN HE PERCHED UPON THE END OF A PLANK FOR THE PURPOSE OF WEIGHING IT DOWN THE MOTION OF THE SAW SHOOK HIS EVERY LIMB
WHICH MADE MOST EXCELLENT HARMONY ON ANOTHER PART WAS THE QUEEN DRESSED OUT IN HER RICHEST ORNAMENTS CONDUCTED BY THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS TO THE TEMPLE OF VIRGINS THE FOUR QUEENS ALSO OF THE KINGS LAST MENTIONED
AND A GREAT NUMBER OF MONKEYS
IT WAS ALSO FAMOUS FOR TWO CHURCHES WHEREOF ONE WAS BUILT IN HONOR OF THE MARTYR JULIUS AND ADORNED WITH A CHOIR OF VIRGINS WHO HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO THE SERVICE OF GOD BUT THE OTHER WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN MEMORY OF SAINT AARON
IT WAS A LITTLE WORK OF ART THAT LAY IN A BOX A TOY NIGHTINGALE WHICH WAS TO SING LIKE A LIVE ONE BUT IT WAS ALL COVERED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES AND SAPPHIRES
LET ARAGO DESCRIBE THE CREW AND CARGO THE VESSEL BELONGED TO THE EMIR OF SECA THE COMMANDER WAS A GREEK CAPTAIN NAMED SPIRO CALLIGERO
AS THEY WERE MOONS BENDING AND LEANING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THEIR BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS PRESENTLY THEY BROUGHT FORWARD SHAHRAZAD AND DISPLAYED HER FOR THE FIRST DRESS
WHO GRIEVOUSLY FEARED THE LOSS OF THEIR DOMINIONS IF HE SHOULD MAKE ANY ATTEMPT UPON THEM ARTHUR FORMED A DESIGN FOR THE CONQUEST OF ALL EUROPE AT THE END OF NINE YEARS IN WHICH TIME ALL THE PARTS OF GAUL WERE ENTIRELY REDUCED
NOR A MAN OF AFFAIRS AND HIS LIFE AS AMBASSADOR OF CARDINAL IPPOLITO
AND I CRAVE THAT THOU RELEASE ME FROM THE DOOM OF DEATH AS A DOLE TO THESE INFANTS FOR AN THOU KILL ME THEY WILL BECOME MOTHERLESS AND WILL FIND NONE AMONG WOMEN TO REAR THEM AS THEY SHOULD BE REARED
SO WHEN SHE HAD MADE AN END OF THE STORY OF MA'ARUF SHE ROSE TO HER FEET AND KISSING GROUND BEFORE HIM SAID O KING OF THE TIME AND UNIQUE ONE OF THE AGE AND THE TIDE I AM THINE HANDMAID
WITH SERIOUS PURPOSE WILL SOON FIND HIMSELF UNDER THE SPELL OF AN ATTRACTION WHICH COMES FROM UNFLAGGING INTEREST AND FROM PERFECTION OF STYLE AND CONSTRUCTION NO TRANSLATION CAN CONVEY AN ADEQUATE SENSE OF THIS BEAUTY OF COLOR AND FORM
AND ARE COMPARATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT AMONG HIS FORTY OR MORE VOLUMES NOR IS MUCH TO BE SAID OF HIS FIRST LONG FICTION
WITH ALL THEIR ENTHUSIASM THE GOOD PEOPLE DID NOT FORGET THE PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE GAINED BY CHRISTIAN THE TAILOR IT WAS SAID THAT HE NEED TAKE NO FURTHER TROUBLE ALL HIS LIFE CORDELE
BUT THE BOOK IN WHICH I READ THIS SAID THE EMPEROR WAS SENT TO ME BY THE HIGH AND MIGHTY EMPEROR OF JAPAN AND SO IT CANNOT BE A FALSEHOOD I WILL HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE IT MUST BE HERE THIS EVENING
I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT NAMED REPLIED THE CAVALIER IT HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT I COMMAND THAT IT SHALL COME HERE THIS EVENING AND SING BEFORE ME SAID THE EMPEROR ALL THE WORLD KNOWS WHAT I HAVE AND I DO NOT KNOW IT MYSELF
FOR HAVING BEEN FLOUTED AND SCOFFED AND SCORNED ALL SUCH ARE ADMONISHED AND HEARTILY WARNED WE WARN THEM ONCE WE WARN THEM TWICE WE WARN AND ADMONISH WE WARN THEM THRICE
IN THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE THERE IS A CURIOUS MINGLING OF CLASSICAL AND ROMANTIC INFLUENCES AND THE GENERATION WHICH GAVE ITSELF UP PASSIONATELY TO THE STUDY OF GREEK AND LATIN STILL READ WITH DELIGHT
AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE POETS WROTE GREAT POEMS ABOUT THE NIGHTINGALE IN THE WOOD BY THE DEEP LAKE THE BOOKS WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND A FEW OF THEM ONCE CAME TO THE EMPEROR HE SAT IN HIS GOLDEN CHAIR AND READ AND READ
BUT ONE THING YOU MUST PROMISE ME EVERYTHING SAID THE EMPEROR AND HE STOOD THERE IN HIS ROYAL ROBES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON HIMSELF AND PRESSED THE SWORD WHICH WAS HEAVY WITH GOLD TO HIS HEART ONE THING I BEG OF YOU
IN SPITE OF SENTIMENTALITY A TRUE FEELING ANIMATES ITS TECHNIQUE THE ATMOSPHERE OF A GERMAN ROYAL RESIDENCE AS HE REVEALS IT APPEARS ALMOST AS HEAVY AS THE REAL THING
AND BEING CARRIED THENCE TO THE ISLE OF AVALLON TO BE CURED OF HIS WOUNDS HE GAVE UP THE CROWN OF BRITAIN TO HIS KINSMAN CONSTANTINE
WAS NOT AT ALL TO HIS LIKING
AND THEY DID HEAR IT AND WERE AS MUCH PLEASED AS IF THEY HAD ALL HAD TEA FOR THAT'S QUITE THE CHINESE FASHION AND THEY ALL SAID OH AND HELD THEIR FOREFINGERS UP IN THE AIR AND NODDED BUT THE POOR FISHERMAN WHO HAD HEARD THE REAL NIGHTINGALE SAID
THERE WAS A GREAT INQUIRY AFTER THE WONDERFUL NIGHTINGALE WHICH ALL THE WORLD KNEW BUT NOT THE PEOPLE AT COURT
AND IN VERY DEED IT WAS A NOTABLE DAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PALACE
BEFORE HIM AND OTHER MEMBERS OF A STATE COMMITTEE TO PUBLISH A NEW AND AUTHORITATIVE EDITION OF THE GREAT ASTRONOMER'S WORKS THE TRANSLATION IS MAINLY THAT OF THE BIOGRAPHIES OF DISTINGUISHED MEN CITED ABOVE
AS SHE HAD NOW RECEIVED THE TITLE OF A REAL COOK MAID
AND DIVIDED THE KINGDOMS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER IN THEIR PRESENCE WHEREAT THE FOLK REJOICED THEN THE TWO KINGS ABODE EACH RULING A DAY IN TURN
SO THEY SCENTED IT WITH ROSEWATER AND WILLOW FLOWER WATER AND PODS OF MUSK AND FUMIGATED IT WITH KAKILI EAGLEWOOD
CHRONICLES AND COPYISTS AND BADE THEM WRITE ALL THAT HAD BETIDED HIM WITH HIS WIFE FIRST AND LAST SO THEY WROTE THIS AND NAMED IT
IN SPITE OF HIS UNTIRING INDUSTRY AUERBACH PRODUCED LITTLE MORE OF CONSEQUENCE THOUGH HE WROTE A NEW SERIES OF BLACK FOREST SKETCHES NACH DREISSIG JAHREN
FOR EVERY FAMILY EXPECTED VISITORS FOR THE GREAT OCCASION OF THE MORROW AS VALENTINE PASSED CHRISTIAN THE TAILOR'S HE HELD HIS HAND TO HIS CAP
AND OCCUPY NO POSITION THAT WOULD ENTAIL REGRET NOR BE ASSAILED BY ANY ILL CONSEQUENCES OR BLAME NOR BE CONSTRAINED TO APOLOGY FOR INCONSIDERATION O GOD FULFILL FOR US THIS OUR DESIRE
AND A THIRD AND SO ON TO THE LAST OF THEM AND EACH BOOK ASTOUNDED AND DELIGHTED HIM MORE THAN THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT TILL HE CAME TO THE END OF THEM THEN HE ADMIRED
FOR BY LONG PRACTICE IN WAR
ONE DAY A LARGE PARCEL CAME TO THE EMPEROR ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN THE NIGHTINGALE HERE WE HAVE A NEW BOOK ABOUT THIS FAMOUS BIRD SAID THE EMPEROR BUT IT WAS NOT A BOOK
ALREADY A NEW EMPEROR HAD BEEN CHOSEN AND THE PEOPLE STOOD OUT IN THE STREET AND ASKED THE CAVALIER HOW THEIR OLD EMPEROR DID
AND RUBBED THEMSELVES WITH SAFFRON WHAT WHILE THE DRUMS BEAT AND THE FLUTES AND PIPES SOUNDED AND MIMES AND MOUNTEBANKS PLAYED AND PLIED THEIR ARTS AND THE KING LAVISHED ON THEM GIFTS AND LARGESSE
HE MANIPULATES THE MANY COLORED THREADS WHICH ARE WROUGHT INTO THE FABRIC OF THE POEM
ON THE WHOLE THE GAME LAWS OF MICHIGAN ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND LEAVE LITTLE TO BE DESIRED IN THE LINE OF BETTERMENT EXCEPT TO BE SIMPLIFIED ALL THE GAME PROTECTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE IS DEBARRED FROM SALE
KILL ALL SUCH WHEREVER FOUND THE HARMLESS CATS ARE DOMESTIC IN THEIR TASTES AND STAY CLOSE TO THE FAMILY FIRESIDE AND THE KITCHEN BEING PROPERLY FED THEY HAVE NO TEMPTATION TO BECOME HUNTERS THERE ARE CATS AND CATS
ALL NON GAME BIRDS SHOULD HAVE PERPETUAL PROTECTION THE CRANES NOW VERGING ON EXTINCTION AND THE PIGEONS AND DOVES SHOULD AT ONCE BE TAKEN OUT OF THE LIST OF GAME BIRDS AND FOREVER PROTECTED
THE RABBITS ARE SLOWLY COMING BACK AND THE CHIPMUNKS ARE VISIBLY INCREASING IN NUMBER THE GRAY SQUIRRELS NOW CHASE OVER THE WALKS WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY LIVING THING AND OUR DUCKLINGS AND YOUNG GUINEAS AND PEACOCKS ARE SAFE ONCE MORE
I COUNT IT AS RATHER STRANGE THAT AMERICAN AND ENGLISH SPORTSMEN
ANYMORE THAN OF ITS MINERAL RESOURCES AND HE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME GAME LAWS AS WHITE MEN SIX NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD CITIZEN AND ALSO BE A SLAUGHTERER OF GAME OR FISHES
FINALLY THE GUN SUPPRESSION BILL PASSED THE TWO HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH A TOTAL OF ONLY FOURTEEN VOTES AGAINST IT AND AFTER A FULL HEARING HAD BEEN GRANTED THE ATTORNEYS OF THE GUNMAKERS WAS PROMPTLY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR WOODROW WILSON
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE SALE OF ALL NATIVE WILD GAME REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE SHOULD BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY BY THE ENACTMENT OF A COMPLETE BAYNE LAW
AND NO ONE MADE ANY FUSS WHATEVER ABOUT THE WASTE OR EXTERMINATION OF WILD LIFE THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF OX TEAMS AND BROAD AXES TO DAY WE ARE LIVING IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD
WILL DOUBT THIS STATEMENT BUT THE PROOF OF ITS TRUTHFULNESS IS ONLY TOO PAINFULLY ABUNDANT
AND THAT THERE IS ONE CAT TO EACH FARM IN MASSACHUSETTS WE HAVE IN ROUND NUMBERS
BEYOND THE NARROW LIMITS COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH CLASS SPORTSMANSHIP SEVEN A GAME BUTCHER
BUT QUITE RIGHT FOR ANTELOPES AND OTHER BIG GAME ALL THE GROUSE AND PTARMIGAN OF MONTANA NEED A FIVE YEAR CLOSE SEASON THE SPLENDID SAGE GROUSE IS NOW EXTINCT IN MANY PARTS OF ITS PREVIOUS RANGE FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS ARE TOO MANY FOR THEM
OFTEN IN VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAWS AND ALWAYS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PROTECTION OF GAME FOR LEGITIMATE SPORT THE LEWIS AND CLARK CLUB CONDEMNS THE PURCHASE OR THE SALE OF THE HEADS OR HORNS OF ANY GAME
AND THE PROTECTION OF GAME THIS FACT WE HAVE MORE COVER THAN THERE WAS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO MORE BRUSH PROBABLY BUT THERE IS NOT ONE PARTRIDGE RUFFED GROUSE TODAY WHERE THERE WERE TWENTY TEN YEARS AGO
A SPECIES TO BE DESTROYED
LEUCORYX ANTELOPE AND WHALE HEADED STORK
EVEN THE LADY WHO IS JOINT OWNER OF THE CAT FEELS VERY BADLY ABOUT ITS DESTRUCTIVENESS AND HAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT IT OUGHT TO BE KILLED BUT THE CAT IS SUCH A FAMILY PET THAT NO ONE IN THE FAMILY HAS THE HEART TO DESTROY IT
WHEN A CROW NESTED IN OUR WOODS NEAR THE BEAVER POND WE WERE GREATLY PLEASED BUT WITH THE FEEDING OF THE FIRST BROOD
AND CLAIM COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS THEY MAY WELL BE SET DOWN AS ONE OF THE UNSEEN FORCES DESTRUCTIVE TO BIRDS NATURALLY WE ASK WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT
IF YOU WANT A GAMELESS STATE LET THE DESTRUCTION GO ON AS IT NOW IS GOING WITH SIXTEEN THOUSAND LICENSED GUNNERS IN THE FIELD EACH YEAR AND YOU WILL SURELY HAVE IT RIGHT SOON DELAWARE
THE WORST OF THE WILD CATS
THE USE OF MACHINE SHOTGUNS IN HUNTING SHOULD BE STOPPED AT ONCE STOP THE USE OF POWER BOATS IN WILD FOWL SHOOTING MASSACHUSETTS
WHILE DRIVING HOME THAT NIGHT MISTER SAVAGE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD KILLED FIFTY OR MORE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
MANY OTHER REVOLTING SIGHTS SUCH AS THE REMAINS OF YOUNG BIRDS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT TO STARVE AND BIRDS WITH BROKEN LEGS AND DEFORMED BEAKS WERE TO BE SEEN
AND WHILE THE YOUNG BIRDS ARE INCAPABLE OF QUICK AND STRONG FLIGHT ALL DOGS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE RESTRAINED FROM FREE HUNTING AND ALL DOGS FOUND HUNTING IN THE WOODS DURING THE SEASON REFERRED TO SHOULD BE ARRESTED
THE REPUTATION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL DEMANDS IT WHETHER THE GODS OF THE CAFES WILL CONSENT OR NOT FLORIDA SHOOTING SHORE BIRDS AND WATERFOWL IN LATE WINTER AND SPRING SHOULD BE STOPPED
AND THE TAGGING SYSTEM THAT IT PROVIDES THE STATE GAME WARDENS WOULD HAVE SO STRONG A GRIP ON THE SITUATION THAT THE PRESENT UNLAWFUL SALE OF GAME WOULD BE COMPLETELY STOPPED HALF WAY MEASURES IN PREVENTING THE SALE OF GAME WILL NOT ANSWER
TO HER RATS AND MICE WERE MERE CHILD'S PLAY
THE OPEN SEASON FOR DEER VARIES FROM TEN WEEKS TO FOUR WEEKS AND IN PARTS OF THREE COUNTIES THERE IS NO OPEN SEASON AT ALL SILENCERS ARE PROHIBITED AND FIREARMS IN FORESTS MAY BE PROHIBITED BY THE GOVERNOR DURING DROUGHTS
SERIOUS AS WERE THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE POACHERS THEIR OPERATIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BEFORE ANY OF THE SPECIES HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTERMINATED
WILL LINGER ONLY IN HISTORY AND TRADITION IT IS THE SINCEREST HOPE OF ALL LOVERS OF WILD LIFE OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT A STRONG AND INVINCIBLE SENTIMENT
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SWORD AND SHIELD HANG USELESS UPON THE WALLS OF OLD AGE NEW YORK BEGAN TO PROTECT HER DEER IN SEVENTEEN O FIVE AND HER HEATH HENS IN SEVENTEEN O EIGHT
AND THE STEADY EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES THE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP HAS BECOME A MATTER OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE IF A MAN CAN SHOOT THE LAST LIVING BURCHELL ZEBRA OR PRONG HORNED ANTELOPE AND BE A SPORTSMAN AND A GENTLEMAN
BESIDES THE CAMP FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA THE LEWIS AND CLARK CLUB OF PITTSBURGH JOHN M PHILLIPS PRESIDENT THE NORTH AMERICAN FISH AND GAME PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL
THE TEST IS RATHER IN A LOVE OF FOREST MOUNTAINS AND DESERT IN ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE HABITS OF ANIMALS IN THE STRENUOUS PURSUIT OF A WARY AND DANGEROUS QUARRY
EMBRACING THE LIST THAT TO EVERY SELF RESPECTING STATE SEEMS INDISPENSABLE MARYLAND HAS ALMOST NONE SAVE CERTAIN BAG LIMIT LAWS OTHERWISE THE STATE IS WIDE OPEN
IS QUITE SWEEPING AT THE SAME TIME MISTER RAYMOND L DITMARS POINTS OUT THE FACT THAT THIS SERPENT FEEDS DURING SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR ON MICE
AND BY NO MEANS IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO A SUCCESSFUL OUTING TWELVE THE BEST HUNTER IS THE MAN WHO FINDS THE MOST GAME KILLS THE LEAST AND LEAVES BEHIND HIM NO WOUNDED ANIMALS
BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY OF THEM AND THOSE THAT HUNT ARE NOT AFRAID TO HUNT IN THE DAYTIME OF COURSE
AND SO THOROUGHLY ACCEPTED AND PROMULGATED THAT THEIR BINDING FORCE CAN NOT BE IGNORED AMONG OTHER THINGS IT IS TIME FOR A LIST OF SPECIES TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH NO MAN CLAIMING TO BE EITHER A GENTLEMAN OR A SPORTSMAN
NEW YORK'S FIRST LAW AGAINST THE SALE OF CERTAIN GAME DURING CLOSE SEASONS WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IN NINETEEN ELEVEN NEW YORK ENACTED WITH ONLY ONE ADVERSE VOTE
A NEW CODIFICATION OF THE STATE GAME LAWS WENT INTO EFFECT THROUGH THE INITIATIVE OF GOVERNOR DIX AND CONSERVATION COMMISSIONERS VAN KENNEN MOORE AND FLEMING ASSISTED AS SPECIAL COUNSEL
A CORPS OF SALARIED GAME PROTECTORS SHOULD BE CHOSEN FOR ACTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE GAME PROTECTION NEVADA'S BAG LIMITS ARE AMONG THE BEST OF ANY STATE THE ONLY SERIOUS FLAW BEING TEN SAGE GROUSE PER DAY WHICH SHOULD BE ZERO

CLEARING THE LAWN HE PRESENTLY STRUCK INTO A BRIDLE PATH THAT LED TO THE WOODS HERE HE AGAIN PAUSED TO SEARCH FOR THE MUCH NEEDED STICK FOUND ONE SUITED TO HIS PURPOSE
MADE OFF WITH ALL SPEED ACROSS THE LAWN BUT HE WAS BLEEDING AT SO FEARFUL A RATE THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO PAUSE LONG ENOUGH TO IMPROVISE A TOURNIQUET BY KNOTTING HIS HANDKERCHIEF ABOVE THE WOUND

THE LENGTH OF THEIR STAY TO DEPEND UPON CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS IN JUNE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THEY LEFT THEIR HOMES AND TRAVELING NORTHWARD PAID A SHORT VISIT TO RELATIVES AND FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA THEN TOOK THE STEAMER FOR EUROPE

SUCKLING ADELAIDE'S MARRIAGE WAS FIXED FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AND MISTER DINSMORE AND ELSIE DECIDED TO TAKE THEIR TRIP TO LOUISIANA AT ONCE THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETURN IN SEASON FOR THE WEDDING AT WHICH ELSIE WAS TO BE FIRST BRIDESMAID
MY OWN DEAR FATHER SHE SAID LOW AND TREMULOUSLY WHILE HER FACE FLUSHED CRIMSON
NAP CLEAN THE MUD AND BLOOD FROM THE GENTLEMAN'S CLOTHES TAKE HIS BOOTS OUT AND CLEAN THEM TOO AND SEE THAT HE DOESN'T WANT FOR ATTENTION WHILE I AM GONE GOOD MORNING SIR MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME AND THE DOCTOR WALKED OUT
REVENGE AT FIRST THOUGH SWEET BITTER ERELONG BACK ON ITSELF RECOILS MILTON'S PARADISE LOST AT THE INSTANT OF DISCHARGING HIS REVOLVER
GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR PHILOCTETES TO KINDLE THE FIRE THAT WAS TO REDUCE HIM TO ASHES
BACK TO THEIR SHIPS WENT ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN OUT OF EACH SHIP WERE SIX MEN SLAIN WHILE THEY WERE YET SAD AT HEART AND WEARY FROM THE FIGHT A TERRIBLE TEMPEST AROSE LAND AND SEA WERE BLOTTED OUT THE SHIPS WERE DRIVEN HEADLONG
I WOULD THAT MY HUSBAND IF EVER I HAVE ONE SHOULD BE AS HE THEN SHE AND HER MAIDENS BROUGHT HIM FOOD AND WINE AND HE ATE HUNGRILY FOR IT WAS MANY DAYS SINCE HE HAD EATEN
SOMETIMES HE HID HIMSELF AS ONE AMONG A TROOP OF TIMID REINDEER SOMETIMES HE LAY IN THE NEST OF A WOOD PIGEON SOMETIMES HE SWAM A BRIGHT SPOTTED FISH IN THE SEA BUT WHEREVER HE WAS AMONG LIVING CREATURES
SOME DAY THOU WILT MARRY NAUSICAA SHE SAID
AND CARRY THEM TO THE SHIPS THEN LET US RETURN AND DRIVE ALL THE KIDS AND LAMBS FROM THEIR FOLDS DOWN TO THE SHORE AND SAIL WITH THEM IN OUR SWIFT SHIPS HOMEWARD OVER THE SEA BUT ODYSSEUS WOULD NOT LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID
THE WIND WOULD BLOW IT WHITHERSOEVER IT WAS DESIRED THAT THE SHIP SHOULD GO BROK THEN MADE HIS OFFERINGS AND TO ODIN HE GAVE THE RING DRAPNIR WHICH HAD BEEN MADE WITH SUCH MAGIC SKILL THAT EVERY NINTH NIGHT EIGHT OTHER RINGS DROPPED OFF IT THOUGH
SO SAYING HE CLIMBED INTO HIS SHIP AND HIS MEN ROWED HIM ACROSS TO THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES WHEN THEY WERE NEAR THE SHORE THEY SAW A GREAT CAVE BY THE SEA
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS THE SERVANT REPEATED THEM WORD FOR WORD AS HE HAD HEARD THEM TO HIS MISTRESS AND THUS HIS THEFT WAS DISCOVERED AND HE WAS SEVERELY PUNISHED AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE YOUNG MAN APPEARED WITH THE OLD FARMER
PHYLLIS BEGGED HIM TO STAY BUT GUY SAID I MUST GO SO DRESSED IN PILGRIM ROBES WITH STAFF IN HAND HE SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY ONE DAY AS HE WALKED HE CAME UPON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS SAD
PRAISING THE DISCERNMENT OF HARISARMAN THEN HARISARMAN WAS HONORED BY ALL MEN AS A SAGE AND DWELT THERE IN HAPPINESS HONORED BY STHULADATTA NOW
A WOMAN BROUGHT ME ONE TO DAY AND ON MY INQUIRING WHETHER IT WAS A MALE OR FEMALE THE FISH LAUGHED MOST RUDELY A FISH LAUGH IMPOSSIBLE YOU MUST BE DREAMING I AM NOT A FOOL
AND WITH IT BLOCKED THE DOORWAY THEN SITTING DOWN HE MILKED THE EWES AND BLEATING GOATS
TO KILL THESE DREADFUL BIRDS WAS THE SIXTH LABOR MINERVA SUPPLIED HERCULES WITH A BRAZEN RATTLE WITH WHICH HE ROUSED THE BIRDS FROM THEIR NESTS AND THEN SLEW THEM WITH HIS POISONED ARROWS WHILE THEY WERE ON THE WING THIS VICTORY MADE HERCULES POPULAR
THE ROBBERS SLEW THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THEIR JEWELS TOO
AFTER THIS PHYLLIS AND GUY WERE MUCH TOGETHER AND AT LAST GUY SAID SUDDENLY PHYLLIS I LOVE THEE I CANNOT HELP IT IN GREAT ANGER SHE SENT HIM AWAY GUY GREW VERY SAD AND PHYLLIS VERY LONELY
HE WAS TOO GREAT HEARTED TO STEAL INTO THE CAVE LIKE A THIEF AND TAKE AWAY THE GIANT'S GOODS WITHOUT FIRST SEEING WHETHER POLYPHEMUS MIGHT NOT TREAT HIM AS A FRIEND RECEIVING FROM HIM THE CORN AND WINE HE HAD BROUGHT AND GIVING HIM GIFTS IN RETURN
GIBRALTAR AND ABYLA CEUTA
AND HER OLD NURSE KINDLED A FIRE FOR HER AND GOT READY HER SUPPER WHEN ODYSSEUS THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO FOLLOW HE WENT TO THE CITY HE MARVELED AT THE GREAT WALLS AND AT THE MANY GALLANT SHIPS IN THE HARBORS
YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME TWICE
ALL THE LIVELONG DAY ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN SAT AND FEASTED AS THEY ATE AND DRANK THEY LOOKED ACROSS THE WATER AT THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPES WHERE THE SMOKE OF WOOD FIRES CURLED UP TO THE SKY
THE MAN MUST BE MAD AND SAYING THIS HE BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER FATHER SAID THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS A VERY SHARP AND WISE GIRL
IF ONLY I HAD SINDRI'S AWL SIGHED THE DWARF AND INSTANTLY HIS BROTHER'S AWL WAS IN HIS HAND SWIFTLY IT PIERCED THE LIPS OF THE MISCHIEF MAKER AND SWIFTLY BROK SEWED THEM TOGETHER AND BROKE OFF THE THREAD AT THE END OF THE SEWING
WHICH MEANS TONGUE WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER BROTHER HAD STOLEN THAT TREASURE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE PALACE SHE BEING ALARMED AT HARISARMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
WHEN ONCE THE FATES HAD DECIDED WHAT THE LOT OF ANY BEING WHETHER GOD OR MAN WAS TO BE JUPITER HIMSELF COULD NOT ALTER THEIR DECISION IT WAS TO THESE FATEFUL THREE THEN THAT JUNO MADE HER PRAYER CONCERNING THE INFANT HERCULES
ALAS HE HAS GONE FAR BEYOND THE SEAS REPLIED THE MAN AND SO HAS GUY OF WARWICK WE KNOW NOT WHERE THEY ARE THEN GUY TOOK HIS STAFF AND TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARD WINCHESTER
SO THAT MANY GOATS ROAMED UNHARMED THROUGH THE WOODS AND CROPPED THE FRESH GREEN GRASS IT WAS A GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND RICH MEADOWS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE SEA THE VINES GREW STRONG AND FRUITFUL
THERE ODYSSEUS STAYED UNTIL NAUSICAA SHOULD HAVE HAD TIME TO REACH THE PALACE WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE STOPPED AT THE GATEWAY AND HER BROTHERS CAME OUT AND LIFTED DOWN THE LINEN AND UNHARNESSED THE MULES NAUSICAA WENT UP TO HER ROOM
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A MAN IN THE PALACE WHO IS PLOTTING AGAINST THE KING'S LIFE JOY JOY EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON
WITH A GREAT LOVE HE LOVED HIS FAIR WIFE AND LITTLE SON AND OLD FATHER AND HIS LITTLE KINGDOM BY THE SEA WAS VERY DEAR TO HIM I CAN SEE NOUGHT BESIDE SWEETER THAN A MAN'S OWN COUNTRY HE SAID
LOKI WRIGGLED HIS SLIPPERY SLIMY LENGTH THROUGH THOR'S FINGERS BUT THE THUNDERER GRASPED HIM TIGHTLY BY THE TAIL AND HOLDING HIM IN THIS MANNER IN THIS HAND WADED TO THE SHORE THERE FATHER ODIN AND THE OTHER GODS MET HIM AND
SHEATHE THY SWORD I PRAY THEE ODYSSEUS AND LET US BE AT PEACE THEN SAID ODYSSEUS
SOMETIME AFTERWARDS EURYSTHEUS HAVING HEARD RUMORS OF A WONDERFUL TREE WHICH IN SOME UNKNOWN LAND YIELDED GOLDEN APPLES WAS MOVED WITH GREAT GREED TO HAVE SOME OF THIS REMARKABLE FRUIT
ONE OF THESE RAN UP TO THE SKY AND IN THIS CLIFF WAS A DARK CAVE IN WHICH LIVED SCYLLA A HORRIBLE MONSTER WHO AS THE SHIP PASSED SEIZED SIX OF THE MEN WITH HER SIX DREADFUL HEADS
FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
AND AFTER HIS DEATH HE WAS RECEIVED AS A GOD AMONGST THE IMMORTALS ON MOUNT OLYMPUS
ALTHOUGH NOW THEY ARE EIGHTEEN MILES APART HERCULES SLEW THE GIANT THE TWO HEADED DOG AND GERYON HIMSELF AND IN DUE COURSE BROUGHT THE OXEN TO EURYSTHEUS
WHOSE BRISTLES WERE OF THE FINEST GOLD
LOOK INTO THE FACE OF HER CHILD LOKI THE MISCHIEF MAKER AMONG THE GIANTS OFTEN LOOKED AT SIB AND LONGED TO DO HER SOME EVIL
HE CALLED HARISARMAN WHO SAID YESTERDAY I WAS FORGOTTEN BUT TO DAY NOW THE HORSE IS STOLEN I AM CALLED TO MIND
FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
BUT ODYSSEUS TOLD HIM WHY IT WAS THAT NAUSICAA HAD BADE HIM STAY BEHIND BE NOT VEXED WITH THIS BLAMELESS MAIDEN HE SAID TRULY SHE IS THE SWEETEST AND THE FAIREST MAIDEN I EVER SAW
WE SHALL SEE LATER THAT HERCULES HIMSELF DIED FROM THE POISON OF ONE OF THESE SELF SAME ARROWS THE THIRD LABOR IMPOSED UPON HERCULES BY EURYSTHEUS WAS THE CAPTURE OF THE ARCADIAN STAG
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF GREECE AND EURYSTHEUS SAW THAT NOTHING HE COULD DEVISE WAS TOO HARD FOR THE HERO TO ACCOMPLISH THE SEVENTH LABOR WAS TO CAPTURE A MAD BULL THAT THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE HAD LET LOOSE IN THE ISLAND OF CRETE OF WHICH ISLAND MINOS WAS AT THAT TIME KING
AND WHEN UNDER ITS INFLUENCE SHE WAS VERY DESPERATE AND ACTED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO KILL SOME OF THE SLAVES AFTER THE EVIL SPIRIT LEFT HER AND SHE HAD REGAINED HER WONTED COMPOSURE SHE WOULD PRETEND THAT SHE LOVED HER NEGROES AND WOULD MAKE A GREAT FUSS OVER THEM
THEY PROCURED EMPLOYMENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HADDONFIELD SOME SIX OR EIGHT MILES FROM CAMDEN NEW JERSEY AND WERE SUCCEEDING AS THEY THOUGHT VERY WELL THINGS WENT ON FAVORABLY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS WHEN TO THEIR ALARM

ONE BELONGED TO FRANCIS CROOKSHANKS AND THE OTHER TO CAPTAIN JIM MITCHELL HER MOTHER WHO WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF BETSY WRIGHT ESCAPED WHEN SHE LUCINDA WAS SEVEN YEARS OF AGE OF HER WHEREABOUTS NOTHING FURTHER HAD EVER BEEN HEARD
TO WHOM HE MADE KNOWN FULLY THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WHENCE HE HAD FLED THE DANGERS HE WAS EXPOSED TO FROM SLAVE HUNTERS AND THE STRONG HOPE HE CHERISHED OF REACHING FREE LAND SOON
THAT SLAVERY HAD GIVEN HER ONE CHILD BUT NO HUSBAND AS A PROTECTOR OR A FATHER THE HALF OF WHAT SHE PASSED THROUGH IN THE WAY OF SUFFERING
AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM
THE WORLD HAD BEEN VERY CRUEL TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT GO TO ONSLOW CRESCENT AND BEHAVE THERE PRETTILY HEARING THE PRAISES OF FLORENCE WITH ALL THE ARDOR OF A DISCREET LOVER HE KNEW WELL WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS RIGHT COURSE
THE WEAKER BECAME THE GROUND ON WHICH SHE WAS STANDING IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID AT LAST IF IT REALLY BE SO IF YOU WILL SAY AGAIN THAT IT IS SO AFTER HEARING ME OUT TO AN END I WILL DESIST
AND YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER THAT HE EVER OFFENDED YOU MISSUS CLAVERING HAD WRITTEN BOTH TO JULIA AND TO HARRY AND THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL HAD BEEN SETTLED HARRY HAD ALREADY COMMUNICATED HIS INTENTION OF COMING DOWN AND LADY ONGAR
KNOWING KNOWING THAT I WAS NOT TO BE YOUR WIFE O GOD I HAVE SINNED I HAVE SINNED AND I AM PUNISHED NO NO SAID HE RISING FROM HIS KNEES IT WAS NOT AS YOU SAY THEN HOW WAS IT SIR
AND REMEMBER THIS THAT MY ONLY EARTHLY WISH AND AMBITION IS IN YOUR HANDS THEN HE WENT ON HIS WAY TOWARD HIS OWN LODGINGS AND SHE ENTERED THE PARSONAGE GARDEN BY HERSELF
IF I WERE TO SIT STILL AND THINK OF IT FOR A WEEK TOGETHER WHAT GOOD COULD I DO BUT HOW NOT TO THINK OF IT THAT IS THE THING WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT I SUPPOSE I WILL DRESS AND THEN GO DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
THEN SHE ROSE AND FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE CHAMBER AND WHEN HE WENT TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES SHE RETURNED TO THE ROOM IN WHICH HE HAD FOUND HER THERE SHE SAT AND WEPT WHILE HE WENT DOWN AND DINED AND DRANK ALONE
HOW WAS HE TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH HER THAT LETTER FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREPARING THE WORDS AS HE WENT TO BOLTON STREET BEFORE THE NECESSITY FOR IT HAD BECOME IRREVOCABLE DID NOT NOW APPEAR TO HIM TO BE VERY EASY
AND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER BEDROOM BUT IN A SMALL SITTING ROOM WHICH SHE GENERALLY USED WHEN SIR HUGH WAS NOT AT THE PARK
UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF IT SO YOU WILL FIND NO COMFORT AND I EXPECT NONE SO THERE IS AN END OF THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE THINK OF THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY YOU KNOW AND IT IS OF NO MORE USE FOR ME TO BOTHER YOU
SAY THAT YOU WILL BE MY WIFE NO I WILL NOT SAY IT SHE ROSE AGAIN FROM HER CHAIR AND TOOK HER HAND AWAY FROM HIM I WILL NOT SAY IT GO NOW AND THINK OVER ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND I ALSO WILL THINK OF IT GOD HELP ME
SOMETHING OF TENDER SOLICITUDE BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE SERVANTS WOULD BE THERE AND KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SOFT BEFORE THEM SHE REMEMBERED ALSO THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD RECEIVED HER INSTRUCTIONS AND SHE FEARED TO DISARRANGE THE SETTLED PROGRAMME
THE WORLD STILL LOOKED ASKANCE AT LADY ONGAR AND HUGH DID NOT WISH TO TAKE UP THE ARMOR OF A PALADIN IN HER FAVOR IF ARCHIE MARRIED HER ARCHIE WOULD BE THE PALADIN THOUGH INDEED IN THAT CASE NO PALADIN WOULD BE NEEDED
LET HER ANGER BE WHAT IT MIGHT SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD SAID IT AS HE PLANNED THIS THERE CAME TO HIM A LITTLE COMFORT FOR HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING GRAND IN SUCH A RESOLUTION YES HE WOULD DO THAT
AND YOU LEAVE ME HERE ALONE YOUR BROTHER IS HERE MADAM GORDELOUP MY BROTHER IS NOTHING TO ME YOU KNOW WELL THAT HE HAS COME AND CAN GO WHEN HE PLEASE I COME HERE TO FOLLOW YOU TO BE COMPANION TO YOU
OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW WHAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOURSELF SHE SAID YES I KNOW NOW WHAT I MUST DO IF SUCH IS TO BE YOUR ANSWER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AS TO THAT I CANNOT REMAIN AT CLAVERING
EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED THE ONGAR CLASS BETTER BUT STILL AS SUCH WAS HIS LOT HE MUST TAKE IT AS IT CAME AND ENTERTAIN BOTH SUBJECTS OF INTEREST WITHOUT ANY COMMINGLING OF THEM
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU TWENTY POUNDS THAT WILL BRING YOU TO LONDON WHEN YOU PLEASE TO FOLLOW TWENTY POUNDS WHAT IS TWENTY POUNDS NO I WILL NOT HAVE YOUR TWENTY POUNDS
HE WILL BE HERE SOON IF HE COMES TO NIGHT LADY CLAVERING SAID AND IT WILL BE BETTER THAT HE SHOULD FIND ME ALONE WILL IT BE BETTER
HIS FATHER LORD COURTON WAS THEN ALIVE AS WAS ALSO HIS GRANDFATHER HE WAS A NICE GOOD LOOKING LAD THEN AS REGARDS HIS BEING NICE
LEAVING THE TWENTY POUNDS ON THE TABLE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM SHE KNEW THAT THE MONEY WAS THERE BUT SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PICK IT UP
WHO WILL DO SO HUGH OH
BUT HIS GUEST WAS BY NO MEANS A MAN OF THAT STAMP EXCEPTING THAT THE COUNT'S AGE WAS ALTOGETHER UNCERTAIN NO CORRECTNESS OF GUESS ON THAT MATTER BEING POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF HIS APPEARANCE HARRY'S PRECONCEIVED NOTION WAS WRONG IN EVERY POINT
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT IT WOULD BE NO PUNISHMENT AND I WAS GLAD TO HEAR IT SOCIETY IS AS YOU SAY OPEN TO YOU AND YOU WILL LOSE NOTHING OF COURSE SOCIETY IS OPEN TO ME HAVE I COMMITTED MYSELF
WITHOUT HIS HEART COULD IT REALLY BE GOOD FOR FLORENCE POOR INJURED FLORENCE THAT SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY A MAN WHO HAD CEASED TO REGARD HER MORE THAN ALL OTHER WOMEN
BUT THE COUNT NEVER FORGOT ANY OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES FOR PLEASURE AND IN ALL THINGS MADE THE MOST OF HIS OWN RESOURCES TO BE RICH IS NOT TO HAVE ONE OR TEN THOUSAND A YEAR BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE OR TEN THOUSAND
AND GO AWAY FROM CLAVERING FOR EVER NOTHING ELSE CAN BE REASON ENOUGH MY BEING POOR OUGHT NOT TO MAKE YOU THROW ME ASIDE IF YOU LOVED ME
AND SHE PUSHED AWAY FROM HER THE TWO NOTES WHICH LADY ONGAR HAD ALREADY PUT UPON THE TABLE WHO IS TO PAY ME FOR THE LOSS OF ALL MY TIME TELL ME THAT
YOU THINK HE WILL COME EH OF COURSE HE WILL COME I DO NOT KNOW HE DOES NOT LIKE COMING TO THE COUNTRY HE WILL BE SURE TO COME NOW HERMIONE AND WHO WILL TELL HIM SOME ONE MUST TELL HIM BEFORE HE COMES TO ME

BECAUSE THE MAN WAS RICH HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN ILL TREATING HIS WIFE DID HE NOT BRING FALSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ROB HER AFTER HIS DEATH OF ALL THAT OF WHICH YOU THINK SO MUCH DID HE NOT HEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST HER TO HIS OWN DISHONOR
MY BROTHER YES COUNT PATEROFF WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WELL IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY AS OF COURSE YOU WILL NOT TELL ME BUT WILL YOU SAY WHEN YOU WILL SEE HIM NEXT
WHEN YOU WERE HERE BEFORE I ASKED YOU TO CALL ME SO HOPING LONGING BELIEVING DOING MORE
THERE WAS NOT A TEAR IN HER EYE I WILL WRITE TO JULIA SAID MISSUS CLAVERING AND I WILL READ TO YOU MY LETTER NO DO NOT READ IT ME WHAT IS THE USE HE HAS MADE HER QUARREL WITH ME
I LIKE A PERSON WHO WILL DO THAT YOU ARE SURE THEN THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE TRUTH OUT OF YOUR FRIEND EVEN IF IT BE A SIMPLE NEGATIVE OR A REFUSAL TO GIVE ANY REPLY TO THE QUESTION ASKED FLORENCE BURTON IS ALWAYS CLEAR IN WHAT SHE SAYS
IN THE MATTER OF THE BREAKFAST SIR HUGH HAD INDEED OF LATE GOT THE BETTER OF HIM THE SERVANTS WERE KEPT ON BOARD WAGES AND THERE WERE NO HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS BUT THERE WAS ARCHIE'S ROOM AND SIR HUGH FELT THIS TO BE A HARDSHIP
I CAME AWAY OF COURSE WITHOUT ANY DINNER SHE HERSELF HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE THE MORNING BUT SHE NEITHER SPOKE NOR THOUGHT OF THAT SHE RANG THE BELL AND GOING OUT INTO THE PASSAGE
HE HAD A GREAT EYE TO DISCOUNT AND LOOKED CLOSELY INTO HIS BILLS HE SEARCHED FOR CHEAP SHOPS AND SOME MEN BEGAN TO SAY OF HIM THAT HE HAD FOUND A CHEAP ESTABLISHMENT FOR SUCH WINES AS HE DID NOT DRINK HIMSELF
MORE HOPE THAT YOU MAY POSSIBLY LEARN TO LOVE ME IN A FEW DAYS I WILL ASK YOU AGAIN WHETHER I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK UPON THE SUBJECT TO YOUR FATHER NOW I WILL SAY FAREWELL AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU
WHO EVER HEARD HIM SAY A SOFT WORD TO HIS WIFE BUT HE WILL FEEL IT NOW FOR THIS CHILD WAS HIS HEIR HE WILL BE HIT HARD NOW AND I PITY HIM
SHAKING HANDS WITH HARRY CLAVERING DECLARED THAT HE HAD INCURRED NO TROUBLE AND DECLARED ALSO THAT HE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HAVE TAKEN ANY TROUBLE IN OBEYING A BEHEST FROM HIS FRIEND LADY ONGAR HAD HE BEEN A POLE AS WAS THE COUNT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ADD
AND WAS NO FITTING COMPANION FOR CECILIA BURTON THE WORLD HE THOUGHT HAD USED HIM ILL HE COULD HAVE BEEN TRUE TO JULIA BRABAZON WHEN SHE WAS WELL NIGH PENNILESS IT WAS NOT FOR HER MONEY THAT HE HAD REGARDED HER
REMEMBER THAT WITH HER YOU NEEDN'T STAND ON YOUR P'S AND Q'S AS YOU WOULD WITH ANOTHER WOMAN SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS ABOUT AND WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE HAS TO GET AS WELL AS WHAT SHE IS EXPECTED TO GIVE ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IF SHE ACCEPTS YOU
AS HE WADDLED BACK TOWARDS THE BANKS OF THE CONGO NOW IN THE SAME OLD SPOT HE FOUND THE HEN WHO HAD BEEN IMPROVING HIS ABSENCE BY GREEDILY STUFFING HERSELF ON BEETLE BUGS FLIES AND MOSQUITOES
WHAT A FOOL I WAS TO BE CAUGHT BY SUCH A WORD
ONCE HE HAD BEEN PROUD OF HIS SOLITARINESS AND OF HIS UNUSUAL BEAUTY WHICH CAUSED SUCH WONDER WHEN HE WENT ABROAD BUT NOW HE WAS OLD AND WEAK AND WEARY AND HE WAS LONELY
WHILE THE TRIBE PLANNED A FINE FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF THE YOUNG HERO EARLY ON THE MORROW
SO IT WAS SAY THE MUSSULMANS THAT A BIRD TOLD SOLOMON OF THE GREAT QUEEN WHOSE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE
AND TOLD HIM ALL HER TROUBLE GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THAT NOBLE BIRD FOR HIS FLATTERY AND HIS CRUELTY LET THE BAT NEVER PRESUME TO FLY ABROAD UNTIL THE SUN GOES DOWN HE CRIED
SO HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL UNTIL SHE CAME CAUTIOUSLY BACK CARRYING SOMETHING IN HER BEAK IT WAS ROUND AND WHITE AND GLINTED LIKE MOONLIGHT WHITEBIRD'S EYES STUCK OUT GREEDILY IT IS A PIECE OF SILVER HE THOUGHT
AND WE WILL LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER ON THE CHIMNEY TOP FAR ABOVE THE OTHER BIRDS AND I WILL NEVER BE CROSS AGAIN BUT THE HERON ANSWERED AWAY WITH YOU I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP I AM TIRED OF YOUR CROAKING VOICE LEAVE ME ALONE
BUT THE STORK AROSE IN HIS NEST FLAPPING HIS WINGS CROSSLY AND CRIED BE OFF YOU BAGGAGE DON'T COME HERE TO INSULT MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE BE OFF I SAY TO YOUR MUSHY SQUSHY RHEUMATICKY BOG I WANT NO MORE OF YOU
ONE CAN READILY IMAGINE THE CHARM OF YOUR SOCIETY COME THEN MISS HERON WHY SHOULD WE NOT MAKE A HAPPY COUPLE IF WE CAN ONLY ARRANGE THIS ONE LITTLE FOOLISH MATTER BE MY WIFE COME LIVE WITH ME IN MY LOVELY NEST
YOU ARE NO MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MANY OF YOUR BROTHERS YET THEY ALL OBEYED ME WILLINGLY LOOK AT THE SNOW WHITE DOVE AND THE GORGEOUS BIRD OF PARADISE AND THE PRETTY GROSBEAK THEY HAVE WORKED NOBLY YET THEIR PLUMAGE IS NOT INJURED
WE KNOW THAT IT IS THE POOR WOODPECKER DIGGING AT THE DUSTY WOOD AS THE LORD SAID SHE SHOULD DO AND WHEN WE SPY HER A DUSTY LITTLE BODY WITH BLACK STOCKINGS CLINGING UPRIGHT TO THE TREE TRUNK
AMBERGRIS AND FRANKINCENSE WITH NO MEANER CHOICE ALL NIGHT HE LABORED BEAK AND TALON UNTIL THE NEST WAS READY AND AS THE FIRST TINTS OF DAWN BEGAN TO STREAK THE EAST THE PHOENIX ROSE ONCE
KNOWING WELL THE CRUELTY OF THE WINDS
KING SOLOMON LOOKED KINDLY UPON THE KING OF THE HOOPOES AND SAID BEHOLD DID I NOT WARN YOU OF YOUR FOLLY IN DESIRING TO HAVE CROWNS OF GOLD VANITY AND PRIDE HAVE BEEN YOUR RUIN
RETURN HERE TO ME AND I WILL HELP YOU YET AGAIN SO THE KING OF THE HOOPOES LEFT KING SOLOMON WITH A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SOON ALL THE HOOPOES WERE WEARING GOLDEN CROWNS THEREUPON
SO THE STORK FLEW HOME IN A HUFF BUT THE HERON COULD NOT TRULY SLEEP SHE WAS SO LONELY SO SHE ROSE AT BREAK OF DAY AND FLYING THROUGH THE COOL MORNING AIR CAME AGAIN TO THE STORK'S NEST
THEN THE BLINDWORM GREW VERY ANGRY I WILL GET THE EYE BACK HE CRIED I WILL STEAL IT FROM YOU AS YOU STOLE IT FROM ME SOME TIME WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP
SHE FLUTTERED INTO THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE AND FROM THERE HOPPED DOWN FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH FROM TWIG TO TWIG UNTIL SHE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE SLEEPER'S UGLY HEAD OVER THE ONE CLOSED EYE THEN WHIRR
AND REJOICED IN THE CENTURIES OF SUNSHINE BEFORE HIM DEATH WAS INDEED WORTH DYING TO MAKE THIS LIFE WORTH LIVING SLOWLY THE YOUNG PHOENIX DESCENDED TO THE NEST WHICH HAD BEEN AT ONCE A SEPULCHRE AND A CRADLE
PRETENDING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND SHE LOVED TO LOOK AT HER SLENDER LONG LEGGED BLUE REFLECTION IN THE WATER FOR THE LADY HERON WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT VAIN
AND WHEN HE IS SMACKING HIS GREAT JAWS OVER HIS FOOD HE MAKES SUCH A GREEDY TERRIBLE NOISE THAT THE OTHER ANIMALS STEAL AWAY NERVOUSLY AND HIDE UNTIL IT SHALL BE MASTER CROCODILE'S
FOR FIRST YOU MUST OFFER YOURSELF TO BE HIS SERVANT AND THEN HE WILL BE GENEROUS THEN HE WILL LET YOU CARRY AWAY AS MUCH TREASURE AS YOUR BEAK WILL HOLD THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT
OF COURSE YOU CANNOT SAID THE MBAMBI AS HE RUSTLED AWAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE WE CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING WE WANT IN THIS WORLD NO I SEE WE CANNOT SIGHED THE CROCODILE
FIERCELY THEY BLEW THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND THE SEA RAN HIGH AND IN THE MIDST OF THE HORRIBLE TUMULT THE GOOD SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
BUT THE PHOENIX WAS BATHED IN SUDDEN LIGHT IT WAS THE SIGNAL THE SIGNAL FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN WAITING THOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT THE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS WERE ENDED THE MYSTERY OF HIS LIFE WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLVED
AND HIS FACE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO SEE DESPITE ITS PALE THINNESS MY FATHER HAS ENDED MY INDIAN LIFE HE SAID MY FATHER TOO AMBITIOUS
AND AWAY OUT OF THE SEA WHICH HAD BEEN HIS DEATH HE TOO WAS CLAD IN SOFT PLUMAGE WITH A KINGLY CREST UPON HIS KINGLY HEAD WITH A FAINT CRY HALF OF SORROW FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WE SEE THAT SHE IS CREEPING CLIMBING LOOKING UP EAGERLY TOWARD THE SKY LONGING FOR THE RAIN TO FALL INTO HER THIRSTY BEAK SHE IS ALWAYS HOPING FOR THE STORM TO COME
BUT TO THE WOODPECKER HE SAID AS FOR YOU O WOODPECKER I OBSERVE THAT YOUR FEATHERS ARE UNRUFFLED BY WORK AND THAT THERE IS NO SPOT OF SOIL UPON YOUR BEAK AND CLAWS HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP SO NEAT
WHEN WHITEBIRD SAW THIS SIGHT HE NEARLY TUMBLED OFF HIS PERCH WITH EXCITEMENT
BUT ONE DAY AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE METALWORKER'S SHOP HE MET A JEWELER AND TO HIM HE SHOWED ONE OF THE HOOPOES CROWNS WHAT IS THIS AND WHERE DID YOU FIND IT EXCLAIMED THE JEWELER IT IS PURE GOLD
THE HEN WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST TO DEATH BUT SHE KEPT HER PRESENCE OF MIND AND GASPED FRANTICALLY AS SHE SAW THE GREAT JAWS OPENING TO SWALLOW HER O BROTHER DON'T
FOR LIFE WAS NOT SO DREADFUL A THING AFTER ALL AND HE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO BUILD HER NEST UNDER THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE WHICH HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
IN HIS TIME GREAT KINGS HAD LIVED AND REIGNED AND TURNED TO DUST
I WILL WATCH AND PERHAPS I SHALL FIND OUT SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING MOTHER MAGPIE WAS THE WISEST AND THE SLYEST OF ALL THE BIRDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS WORTH WHILE AS WHITEBIRD KNEW TO TAKE LESSONS OF HER
TO VISIT A TEMPLE IN A FAR COUNTRY
THE HOOPOES FLYING PAST AND CALLING TO THEM FEEBLY HE BEGGED THEM TO SHELTER HIM FROM THE BURNING RAYS THE KING OF THE HOOPOES GATHERED TOGETHER HIS WHOLE NATION
SHOULD NOT GO THE GOOD KING LONGED TO TAKE HER WITH HIM NO MORE THAN SHE COULD HE SMILE AT THE THOUGHT OF SEPARATION BUT HE ALSO FEARED THE SEA
LET US KNOCK HERE SAID THE SHREWD BAT I KNOW THE OLD FELLOW IS NOT ASLEEP THIS IS HIS PROWLING HOUR AND BUT THAT IT IS A STORMY NIGHT HE WOULD BE ABROAD HUNTING WHAT HO MASTER OWL HE SQUEAKED
NO STORMS EVER TROUBLED THE OCEAN AND MARINERS COULD SET OUT UPON THEIR VOYAGES WITHOUT FEAR FOR WHILE HIS LITTLE GRANDCHILDREN ROCKED IN THEIR BASKET THE GOOD KING A EOLUS
SURE ENOUGH IN A LITTLE WHILE THE MAGPIE RETURNED THIS TIME BRINGING SOMETHING WHICH GLOWED YELLOW LIKE SUNLIGHT IT IS A PIECE OF GOLD GASPED WHITEBIRD
WHEN ALL WAS READY SOLOMON WAS WONT TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS THRONE AND WOULD COMMAND THE WINDS TO DO THEIR DUTY
FLUTTERED AWAY TO THE NEIGHBORING WOODS WHERE HE BUILT HIS NEST AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND SINCE THAT DAY THE GLAD LITTLE ROBINS HAVE LIVED AS THAT FIRST ONE PROMISED
IN HEAVY WAGONS OR CLUMSY BOATS BY DUSTY ROADS OR STORMY WAVES IT WAS IN NO SUCH TROUBLOUS WAYS THAT SOLOMON THE ALL POWERFUL TRAVERSED SPACE AND REACHED THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH THANKS TO HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE
THE DOVE REMAINED SILENT LIKE CORDELIA IN THE PLAY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK UNTRUTHS EVEN FOR HER OWN HAPPINESS
TOO SMALL IN POPULATION AND TOO SLIGHT IN STRENGTH TO BE MUCH OF A MENACE TO BOSTON HARTFORD OR NEW YORK IT WAS THE STATESMEN IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND RATHER THAN THE COLONISTS IN AMERICA WHO FIRST GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SLOWLY CONVERGING EMPIRES IN NORTH AMERICA
THE RIGHT OF NATIONALITIES TO FREEDOM AND SELF GOVERNMENT THE INDEPENDENCE OF POLAND FREEDOM OF THE SEAS THE REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS AND THE ABOLITION OF ENTANGLING ALLIANCES THE WHOLE WORLD WAS DISCUSSING THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKABLE MESSAGE
THE FARMER'S WHEAT THE HOUSEWIFE'S SUGAR COAL AT THE MINES LABOR IN THE FACTORIES SHIPS AT THE WHARVES TRADE WITH FRIENDLY COUNTRIES THE RAILWAYS BANKS STORES PRIVATE FORTUNES ALL WERE MOBILIZED AND LAID UNDER WHATEVER OBLIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT DEEMED IMPERATIVE
THE SYMPATHIES OF A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT DOUBT ON THE SIDE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE TO THEM THE INVASION OF THE LITTLE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AND THE HORRORS THAT ACCOMPANIED GERMAN OCCUPATION WERE ODIOUS IN THE EXTREME MOREOVER
CONGRESS BY LAW DECREED THAT THE NATIONAL ARMY SHOULD BE CHOSEN FROM ALL MALE CITIZENS AND MALES NOT ENEMY ALIENS WHO HAD DECLARED THEIR INTENTION OF BECOMING CITIZENS
A NEW QUESTION AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH AMERICAN TRADE WITH THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES SURROUNDING GERMANY GREAT BRITAIN EARLY BEGAN TO INTERCEPT SHIPS CARRYING OIL GASOLINE AND COPPER ALL WAR MATERIALS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION UPON THE SEAS THE REMOVAL AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OF TRADE BARRIERS AMONG NATIONS REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS ADJUSTMENT OF COLONIAL CLAIMS IN THE INTEREST OF THE POPULATIONS CONCERNED FAIR AND FRIENDLY TREATMENT OF RUSSIA
THIS SYSTEM WAS CALLED INDENTURED SERVITUDE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE NUMBER OF BOND SERVANTS EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL TWENTY THOUSAND PURITANS THE YEOMEN THE VIRGINIA GENTLEMEN AND THE HUGUENOTS COMBINED
THE REPLY OF CONGRESS ON APRIL SIXTH WAS A RESOLUTION PASSED WITH ONLY A FEW DISSENTING VOTES DECLARING THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE OF WAR WITH GERMANY AUSTRIA HUNGARY AT ONCE SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL DECEMBER SEVENTH THAT CONGRESS
THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION CONSIDERED FROM ONE SIDE COLONIZATION WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF THE EMIGRANTS WAS AN ECONOMIC MATTER IT INVOLVED THE USE OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO SUSTAIN THEM ON THE VOYAGE AND TO START THEM ON THE WAY OF PRODUCTION
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SOON BEGAN SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS TO PRESENT ITS CAUSE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE MOST FAVORABLE LIGHT POSSIBLE DOCTOR BERNHARD DERNBURG THE FORMER COLONIAL SECRETARY OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SENT TO AMERICA AS A SPECIAL AGENT
TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY A PLAN WAS WORKED OUT WHEREBY SHIPOWNERS AND OTHER PERSONS OF MEANS FURNISHED THE PASSAGE MONEY TO IMMIGRANTS IN RETURN FOR THEIR PROMISE OR BOND TO WORK FOR A TERM OF YEARS TO REPAY THE SUM ADVANCED
IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE EXPRESS TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH BUSINESS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY PASSED UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL BY WAR RISK INSURANCE ACTS ALLOWANCES WERE MADE FOR THE FAMILIES OF ENLISTED MEN COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES WAS PROVIDED
THE SHIP WAS STRUCK BY TWO TORPEDOES AND IN A FEW MINUTES WENT DOWN BY THE BOW
WHO OPENED THE LAKE REGION AND LA SALLE WHO IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY TWO HAD GONE DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE GULF HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE BUILDERS OF FORTS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE FRENCH FOUNDED NEW ORLEANS THUS TAKING POSSESSION OF THE GATEWAY TO THE MISSISSIPPI
AMONG THEM THE FOLLOWING WERE OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT AN ENEMY MERCHANT SHIP CAUGHT ON THE HIGH SEAS WAS A LEGITIMATE PRIZE OF WAR WHICH MIGHT BE SEIZED AND CONFISCATED
THE RECURRENCE OF ANYTHING SO OBVIOUSLY SUBVERSIVE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF WARFARE THE NOTE CLOSED WITH A CLEAR CAUTION TO GERMANY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT OMIT ANY WORD OR ANY ACT NECESSARY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SACRED DUTY
TOLERATION ENCOURAGED DIVERSITY AND DIVERSITY IN TURN WORKED FOR GREATER TOLERATION THE GOVERNMENT AND FAITH OF THE DISSENTING DENOMINATIONS CONSPIRED WITH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TENDENCIES TO DRAW AMERICA AWAY FROM THE ENGLISH STATE
INDEED THEY EXAGGERATED ITS EVILS FOR MANY OF THE CRIMINALS WERE ONLY MILD OFFENDERS AGAINST UNDULY HARSH AND CRUEL LAWS A PEASANT CAUGHT SHOOTING A RABBIT ON A LORD'S ESTATE
THE PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS HAD CAST OFF ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AND ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONGREGATION BEFORE THEY CAME TO AMERICA
AND THE CROWN PRINCE WERE THE SYMBOLS OF ROYAL ARROGANCE ON THE OTHER HAND MANY AMERICANS OF GERMAN DESCENT IN MEMORY OF THEIR TIES WITH THE FATHERLAND OPENLY SYMPATHIZED WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS AND MANY AMERICANS OF IRISH DESCENT
IN THIS GRUESOME BUSINESS THERE LURKED MANY TRAGEDIES AND VERY FEW ROMANCES PARENTS WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND HUSBANDS FROM THEIR WIVES HUNDREDS OF SKILLED ARTISANS CARPENTERS SMITHS AND WEAVERS
AS WELL AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE
WHEN IT WAS DUMBFOUNDED TO HEAR ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THAT THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR AT WASHINGTON HAD ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL RENEWAL OF RUTHLESS SUBMARINE WARFARE THE UNITED STATES AT WAR STEPS TOWARD WAR
WAS FOUNDED TO SECURE FAIR PLAY FOR GERMANY AND AUSTRIA SEVERAL PROFESSORS IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WHO HAD RECEIVED THEIR TRAINING IN GERMANY TOOK UP THE PEN IN DEFENSE OF THE CENTRAL EMPIRES THE GERMAN LANGUAGE PRESS WITHOUT EXCEPTION IT SEEMS
THE ENGLISH COLONIES ENGROSSED WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS GAVE LITTLE OR NO THOUGHT TO THEIR DISTANT NEIGHBORS
CONQUESTS EQUALING IN RAPIDITY AND FAR SURPASSING IN MAGNITUDE THOSE OF CORTES AND PIZARRO HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE EAST WELL COULD THE MERCHANTS OF LONDON DECLARE THAT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF WILLIAM PITT THE IMPERIAL GENIUS OF THIS WORLD WIDE CONFLICT
INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
GERMANY BEGINS THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN GERMANY NOW ANNOUNCED THAT ON AND AFTER FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WHOLE OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND THE WATERS AROUND GREAT BRITAIN WOULD BE DEEMED A WAR ZONE
NO STUDY HAS AS YET BEEN MADE TO GRATIFY THAT INTEREST FOR THE PRESENT IT IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM JUST HOW MANY OF THE COLONISTS WERE ABLE TO BEAR THE COST OF THEIR OWN TRANSFER TO THE NEW WORLD INDENTURED SERVANTS THAT
THE CHURCH WAS ALSO SANCTIONED BY LAW AND SUPPORTED BY TAXES IN THE CAROLINAS AFTER SEVENTEEN O FOUR AND IN GEORGIA AFTER THAT COLONY PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER THE CROWN IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR
MUST BE A TEAM IN WHICH EACH MAN SHALL PLAY THE PART FOR WHICH HE IS BEST FITTED LIBERTY LOANS AND TAXES IN ORDER THAT THE MILITARY AND NAVAL FORCES SHOULD BE STINTED IN NO RESPECT THE NATION WAS CALLED UPON TO PLACE ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT
WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN AMERICAN COLONIAL LIFE WHICH FOSTERED MINDS OF DEPTH AND POWER WOMEN SURMOUNTED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN THE MEN IN THE PROCESS OF SELF EDUCATION
EARLY IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN SHE DECLARED EVEN CARGOES OF GRAIN AND FLOUR TO BE CONTRABAND DEFENDING THE ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAD RECENTLY TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL DOMESTIC STOCKS OF CORN WHEAT AND FLOUR
SENSING THEIR DOOM FELL UPON THE TINY SETTLEMENTS WITH AWFUL FURY IN SIXTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ONLY TO MEET WITH EQUALLY TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT A GENERATION LATER KING PHILIP SON OF MASSASOIT THE FRIEND OF THE PILGRIMS
WITH A VIEW TO STOPPING SERBIAN AGITATION FOR INDEPENDENCE AUSTRIA HUNGARY LAID THE BLAME FOR THIS INCIDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT OF SERBIA AND MADE HUMILIATING DEMANDS ON THAT COUNTRY GERMANY AT ONCE PROPOSED THAT THE ISSUE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS
ACTING ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADVICE DECLARED WAR ALSO ON THAT VASSAL OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AMERICAN WAR AIMS IN MANY ADDRESSES AT THE BEGINNING AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR PRESIDENT WILSON STATED THE PURPOSES WHICH ACTUATED OUR GOVERNMENT IN TAKING UP ARMS
THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE AND THE PROGRESSIVES ACCEPTED CHARLES E HUGHES AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT WHO AS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAD WON A NATIONAL REPUTATION BY WAGING WAR ON MACHINE POLITICIANS
ON FEBRUARY TENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN IT WARNED GERMANY THAT IF HER COMMANDERS DESTROYED AMERICAN LIVES AND SHIPS IN OBEDIENCE TO THAT DECREE THE ACTION WOULD BE VERY HARD INDEED TO RECONCILE WITH THE FRIENDLY RELATIONS HAPPILY SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS
THE ANGLICAN FAITH AND WORSHIP WERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW SUSTAINED BY TAXES IMPOSED ON ALL AND FAVORED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILORS AND THE RICHEST PLANTERS THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SAYS LODGE WAS ONE OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VIRGINIA ARISTOCRACY
AND THE PATRIOT NEWSPAPERS FOUNDED AND MANAGED BY WOMEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES IN THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF AMERICA THE CHURCHES ASSUMED A ROLE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
OF WHICH THEY WILL BECOME THE CARRIERS SAID JOHN RUTLEDGE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ORDERS ABOUT MY HORSE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR HIS HORSE HE LOOKED THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE HOTEL BOOK AND SAW UNDER A DATE TOWARDS THE END OF JULY THE NAME OF COLONEL TRENCH
SHE WAS STUNNED BY DURRANCE'S UNEXPECTED DISCLOSURE SHE HAD SO CAREFULLY GUARDED HER SECRET THAT TO REALISE THAT FOR A YEAR IT HAD BEEN NO SECRET CAME AS A SHOCK TO HER BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER CONFUSION SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE MUST HAVE TIME
SHE SAW THAT HIS FACE LOST SOMETHING OF ITS STERNNESS HE WAS STANDING QUIETLY PREPARED NOW TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE MIGHT WISH TO SAY HE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN HE COULD SEE
HE ONLY SAW AGAIN HOWEVER THAT PUZZLING LOOK OF ENVY IN FEVERSHAM'S EYES YOU SEE THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH CAN HAPPEN HE CONTINUED DISABLEMENT FOR INSTANCE CLEVER MEN COULD MAKE A SHIFT PERHAPS TO PUT UP WITH IT
SENT IN HIS PAPERS THE QUIET CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH HE HAD REVEALED HIS PLAN TO LIEUTENANT SUTCH OVER THE TABLE IN THE CRITERION GRILL ROOM WAS THE MERE VAINGLORY OF A MAN WHO CONTINUALLY DECEIVED HIMSELF
WERE NOT MUTILATIONS PRACTISED HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM SHIVERING EVEN IN THAT STRONG HEAT AND THE GREAT LONELINESS OF THE PLACE SMOTE UPON HIM SO THAT HIS KNEES SHOOK HE FACED ABOUT AND COMMENCED TO RUN
SHE HESITATED BUT SHE COULD NOT STOP MIDWAY
HE FIRST SAW THE SAND STRETCHED LIKE A LAGOON UP TO THE DARK BROWN WALLS OF THE TOWN AND THE OVERSHADOWING FOLIAGE OF THE BIG DATE PALMS RISING ON THE NILE BANK BEYOND
THE WELCOME GREEN OF THE WAVING PALMS AFTER SO MANY ARID DAYS OF SUN AND SAND AND STONES BECAME AN IRONICAL INVITATION TO DEATH HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE HAD NOT ALREADY DONE ENOUGH FOR HONOUR IN VENTURING SO NEAR
HERE TOO HE HAD DONE HIS WORST HARM
SUDDENLY OUTLINED AGAINST THE SKY UPON A CREST OF THE SAND THE ARAB SEATED BY THE WELL LOOKED FIRST AT THE DONKEY AND REMARKING ITS GREY COLOUR HALF ROSE
JUST FIVE YEARS AGO THIS SUMMER AND SHE PROCEEDED WITHOUT FURTHER INVITATION TO GIVE A VOLUMINOUS ACCOUNT OF THE CONFLAGRATION AND THE CAUSE OF IT
SALAM ALEIKUM SAID THE NEGRO AS HE STOPPED HE CARRIED A LONG SPEAR AND A SHORT ONE AND A SHIELD OF HIDE THESE HE LAID UPON THE GROUND AND SAT BY THE ARAB'S SIDE
HE BARKED WAGGED HIS TAIL CROUCHED AND SPRANG AT THE STRANGER'S SHOULDERS WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND IN FRONT OF HIM BURST INTO SHARP EXCITED SCREAMS OF PLEASURE RAN UP TO THE CHURCH DOOR AND BARKED FURIOUSLY THERE
YOU WERE HELPING SOME ONE TO ESCAPE YES WHO
THEN RAN BACK AND JUMPED AGAIN UPON HIS FRIEND THE MAN CAUGHT THE DOG AS IT STOOD UP WITH ITS FOREPAWS UPON HIS CHEST PATTED IT AND LAUGHED SUDDENLY HE CEASED LAUGHING AND STOOD STOCK STILL WITH HIS EYES
THE COLLIE THRUST ITS MUZZLE INTO THE BACK OF HIS KNEE SNIFFED ONCE OR TWICE DOUBTFULLY AND SUDDENLY BROKE INTO AN EXUBERANT WELCOME THE COLLIE DOG HAD A BETTER MEMORY THAN THE LANDLADY OF THE INN
QUITE UNATTAINABLE AND OF GREAT GRIEFS TOO ETERNAL AND WITH A SORT OF NOBILITY BY REASON OF THEIR GREATNESS
HE WAITED AT HALF PAST NINE BY THE CLUMP OF LILACS AND LABURNUMS AT THE END OF THE SAND
HAD YOU ONLY THE MIND TO SEE I WANTED TO HURT YOU
TO HER THEY WERE NOT DEAD COLONEL TRENCH WAS HERE A FORTNIGHT AGO SHE SAID HE TOLD ME YOU WERE BRINGING IT BACK TO ME BUT HE DID NOT KNOW OF THE FOURTH FEATHER SAID FEVERSHAM I NEVER TOLD ANY MAN THAT I HAD IT
AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE HAD SHOT HER BOLT AND HIT NO ONE BUT HERSELF AND THE MAN FOR WHOM SHE CARED SHE REALISED THAT DISTINCTLY SHE LOOKED FORWARD
CALDER COULD GET NOTHING MORE EXPLICIT FROM THEM THAN THIS STATEMENT HOWEVER CLOSELY HE QUESTIONED THEM HE HAD UNDER HIS HAND THE INFORMATION WHICH HE DESIRED THE NEWS OF HARRY FEVERSHAM
IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD I WILL WARN YOU HE WAS HURT THREE WEEKS AGO AND I KNOW THESE PEOPLE NO ONE WILL HAVE TOUCHED HIM SINCE HE WAS HURT THE SIGHT WILL NOT BE PRETTY
FROM THE TIME OF WILLOUGHBY'S COMING SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD NIGHT AND DAY TO THE ONE HALF HOUR DURING WHICH HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD BE WITH HER THE HALF HOUR HAD COME AND PASSED SHE KNEW NOW HOW SHE HAD COUNTED UPON ITS COMING HOW SHE HAD LIVED FOR IT
THAT WOMEN SO MUCH MORE THAN MEN GATHER UP THEIR EXPERIENCES AND LIVE UPON THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS FEVERSHAM AT ALL EVENTS WOULD NOW HAVE DROPPED THE FEATHERS THEN AND THERE AND CRUSHED THEM INTO THE DUST OF THE PATH WITH HIS HEEL THEY HAD DONE THEIR WORK
ABOU FATMA AT THE WELLS OF OBAK
AND PURPOSELY SET AGAINST IT WORDS WHICH FEVERSHAM HAD SPOKEN AND WHICH HE KNEW TO BE TRUE ETHNE EUSTACE WOULD HARDLY BE HAPPY OUTSIDE HER COUNTY OF DONEGAL THEREFORE EVEN HAD THINGS FALLEN OUT DIFFERENTLY AS HE PHRASED IT
THE ARMY THE SPECIAL SERVICE IN THE STRANGE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD A FINE COMPENSATION TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU KNOWING YOU HAD MARRIED A CRIPPLE OUT OF PITY
TUNNELLING VALLEYS SILTING UP LONG SLOPES SO THAT THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY WAS CONTINUALLY CHANGED THE VULTURES AND THE SAND GROUSE
THIS IS NOT A NICE COUNTRY FOR UNTENDED WOUNDS THE GERMAN STUDENT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ALL EXPERIENCE IS GOOD SAID HE AND THE TWO MEN ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT ON TO THE UPPER DECK
OR FROZE IN THE EASTER VACATIONS IN THE BIG SNOW GULLY ON GREAT END RETURNED FEVERSHAM BOTH MEN HAD THE FEELING THAT ON THIS MORNING A VOLUME IN THEIR BOOK OF LIFE WAS ENDED AND SINCE THE VOLUME HAD BEEN A PLEASANT ONE TO READ
YOU DISTRUST ME SHE SAID DEFIANTLY AND WITH A NOTE OF ANGER IN HER VOICE DURRANCE ANSWERED HER QUITE GENTLY HAVE I NO REASON TO DISTRUST YOU
TO GATHER UP HER FACULTIES AGAIN UNDER COMMAND SO SHE SPOKE OF THE UNIMPORTANT THING TO GAIN THE TIME YOU WERE IN THE CHURCH THEN OR YOU HEARD US UPON THE STEPS OR YOU MET HIM AS HE RODE AWAY NOT ONE OF THE CONJECTURES IS RIGHT SAID DURRANCE WITH A SMILE
DURRANCE TURNED BACK AND WALKED HIS HORSE UP TOWARD THE SEATS BENEATH THE TREES EVEN AS A BOY IN HIS HOME AT SOUTHPOOL IN DEVONSHIRE UPON A WOODED CREEK OF THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS
DURRANCE RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AGAIN BUT THE WIND MADE THE TONGUE OF LIGHT FLICKER UNCERTAINLY WITHIN THE GLASS THE RAIN TOO
TO MAHOBEY AND BERBER ON THE NILE A DESERT SO FLAT THAT THE MEREST TUFT OF GRASS KNEE HIGH SEEMS AT THE DISTANCE OF A MILE A TREE PROMISING SHADE FOR A NOONDAY HALT
YOU SENT HARRY AWAY THIS AFTERNOON SAID DURRANCE YOU SAID GOOD BYE TO HIM TWICE
SET HIGH ABOVE THE ROAD UPON HIS RIGHT HAND
TO LETTERKENNY HE RODE RATHER QUICKLY IN A COMPANY OF GHOSTS THE INTERVENING YEARS HAD GRADUALLY BEEN DROPPING FROM HIS THOUGHTS ALL THROUGH HIS JOURNEY ACROSS EGYPT AND THE CONTINENT
SO SOME ONE ELSE WAS WITH YOU AND NOT ANY ONE FROM THE VILLAGE THEN I GOT YOU TO PLAY AND THAT TOLD ME WHO IT WAS WHO RODE THE HORSE YES
YOU TOOK ALL MY GLADNESS FROM ME BY TELLING ME YOU WERE STARTING FOR THE SOUDAN YOU WERE AWAY THREE YEARS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY YEARS FOR ME YOU CAME BACK
WAS DULL THE STREAM RAN GREY IN THE GAP BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE LEAVES FROM THE BRANCHES WERE BLOWN RUSSET AND YELLOW ABOUT THE LAWNS
YOU WENT AWAY JUST AFTER CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME WAS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU WENT AWAY I WENT BECAUSE NEITHER YOU NOR I COULD HAVE KEPT UP THE GAME OF PRETENCES WE WERE PLAYING YOU WERE PRETENDING THAT YOU HAD NO THOUGHT FOR HARRY FEVERSHAM
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR BOTH OF THEM SHE THOUGHT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE NO SIGN OF WHAT SO QUICK A SEPARATION COST HER HE WOULD KNOW SURELY ENOUGH AND SHE WISHED HIM TO KNOW SHE WISHED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONE MOMENT OF HIS SIX YEARS
BUT WHAT WHEN WE CAME TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND THERE WERE NO VISITS TO THE OCULIST WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SOONER OR LATER THE TRUTH MUST HAVE COME TO ME
EVERY PLACE WAS FULL OF JEALOUSY AND COMPLAINTS A NEW INSURRECTION BROKE OUT HEADED BY MUSGRAVE AND TILBY AND THE REBELS BESIEGED CARLISLE WITH THOUSAND MEN BEING REPULSED BY THAT CITY THEY WERE ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR RETREAT BY NORFOLK WHO PUT THEM TO FLIGHT
THE VERY PRECEDENT OF SHAKING SO ANCIENT AND DEEP FOUNDED AN ESTABLISHMENT AS THAT OF THE ROMISH HIERARCHY MIGHT IT WAS APPREHENDED PREPARE THE WAY FOR OTHER INNOVATIONS THE REPUBLICAN SPIRIT WHICH NATURALLY TOOK PLACE AMONG THE REFORMERS
BUT EVEN HER ENEMIES EXPECTED LITTLE ADVANTAGE FROM THIS CONFESSION FOR THEY NEVER DARED TO CONFRONT HIM WITH HER AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED AS WERE ALSO BRERETON AND WESTON NORRIS HAD BEEN MUCH IN THE KING'S FAVOR
NOT TO LEAVE THE NORTHERN FRONTIER DEFENCELESS
SUCH AS IS IMPLIED IN THE KING'S ACCUSATION
BUT JAMES TOLD HIM THAT HE DOUBTED HIS CONCERN WAS EMPLOYED ONLY IN BEHALF OF AN ENEMY
WITHIN NINETY DAYS IN ORDER TO ANSWER FOR THEIR CRIMES IF THEY FAILED HE EXCOMMUNICATED THEM DEPRIVED THE KING OF HIS CROWN LAID THE KINGDOM UNDER AN INTERDICT DECLARED HIS ISSUE BY ANNE BOLEYN ILLEGITIMATE
HAD BEEN NAMED BY THE COURT WITH A VIEW TO THIS EVENT THE KING'S INTENTIONS WERE THE MORE EASILY EFFECTED SOME ALSO HAVING SECRETLY EMBRACED THE DOCTRINE OF THE REFORMATION WERE GLAD TO BE FREED FROM THEIR VOWS AND ON THE WHOLE THE DESIGN WAS CONDUCTED WITH SUCH SUCCESS
THE KING OF ENGLAND WAS INVITED TO ACCEDE NOT ONLY AS A CONTRACTING PARTY
AND ORDERED HIM TO ATTACK THE ENEMY IN FRONT AND BRING ON THE ACTION
HE REQUIRED THEM INSTANTLY TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND SUBMIT TO MERCY PROMISING A PARDON TO ALL EXCEPT SIX WHOM HE NAMED AND FOUR WHOM HE RESERVED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF NAMING
WAS SO OVERAWED THAT AT THIS VERY TIME
HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO EXERT THAT VIGOR WHICH BECAME HIM AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE FAITH AND AFTER AMITY WITH THE EMPEROR WAS ONCE FULLY RESTORED HE SHOULD THEN BE IN A SITUATION
AND IT MAY BE AFFIRMED THAT IN THIS DANGEROUS CONJUNCTURE NOTHING INSURED PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY SO MUCH AS THE DECISIVE AUTHORITY ACQUIRED BY THE KING AND HIS GREAT ASCENDANT OVER ALL HIS SUBJECTS
AND OBLIGED IN BOTH PLACES TO READ ALOUD TO THE PEOPLE THE CONFESSION WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN PUBLISHED IN HIS NAME HE WAS THEN CONFINED TO THE TOWER WHERE HIS HABITS OF RESTLESS INTRIGUE AND ENTERPRISE FOLLOWED HIM
HAD ENLISTED HIMSELF IN THE SAME PARTY AND THE SUPPLENESS OF HIS CHARACTER AND DEXTERITY OF HIS CONDUCT HAD RENDERED HIM EXTREMELY USEFUL TO IT
THE KING VERY HUMBLY REPLIED
AND HAVING REFUSED TO DISCOVER HIS ACCOMPLICES THE CHANCELLOR ORDERED HIM TO BE WHIPPED IN HIS PRESENCE AND AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO THE TOWER WHERE HE HIMSELF SAW HIM PUT TO THE TORTURE
HE SENT A NEW PROCLAMATION REQUIRING THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR OBEDIENCE WITH SECRET ASSURANCES OF PARDON THIS EXPEDIENT HAD ITS EFFECT THE POPULACE WAS DISPERSED
AND HE TOOK THENCE OCCASION TO PRAISE THE KING FOR HIS WONDERFUL GIFTS OF GRACE AND NATURE HE COMPARED HIM FOR JUSTICE AND PRUDENCE TO SOLOMON FOR STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE TO SAMSON AND FOR BEAUTY AND COMELINESS TO ABSALOM
TO INFORM THE COURT OF THIS IMPORTANT INCIDENT THE KING SENT IN ALL HASTE THE EARL OF ARUNDEL TO COMPLIMENT PHILIP ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND AND TO INFORM HIM THAT HE INTENDED TO PAY HIM A VISIT IN PERSON
AND HE NOW QUESTIONED THAT NOBLEMAN WITH REGARD TO THESE ENGAGEMENTS NORTHUMBERLAND TOOK AN OATH BEFORE THE TWO ARCHBISHOPS THAT NO CONTRACT OR PROMISE OF MARRIAGE HAD EVER PASSED BETWEEN THEM HE RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT UPON IT
ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN PRINCES BOTH IN WAR AND NEGOTIATION WERE TURNED TO THE SIDE OF ITALY
ASKE HIMSELF HAD INTENDED TO BE ONE OF THE DEPUTIES AND HE REQUIRED A HOSTAGE FOR HIS SECURITY BUT THE KING WHEN CONSULTED REPLIED THAT HE KNEW NO GENTLEMAN OR OTHER WHOM HE ESTEEMED SO LITTLE AS TO PUT HIM IN PLEDGE FOR SUCH A VILLAIN
WITH WHICH THE AGE WAS GENERALLY SEIZED AND WHICH NOTHING BUT AN ENTIRE UNIFORMITY AS WILL AS A STEADY SEVERITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION COULD BE ABLE TO REPRESS THERE WERE SOME ENGLISHMEN TINDAL JOYE
TOGETHER WITH SUFFOLK HIMSELF FOR HIS PRETENDED REBELLION BUT AFTER THAT TRAITOR HAD PERFORMED ALL THE SERVICES EXPECTED FROM HIM
AND FROM A MOVEMENT OF HIS USUAL VIOLENCE HE MADE THE INNOCENT SUFFER FOR THE GUILTY NORFOLK BY COMMAND FROM HIS MASTER SPREAD THE ROYAL BANNER AND WHEREVER HE THOUGHT PROPER EXECUTED MARTIAL LAW IN THE PUNISHMENT OF OFFENDERS
BUT WHEN THE REFORMERS PROCEEDED THENCE TO DISPUTE CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE SACRAMENTS THE OPERATIONS OF GRACE THE TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE WITH THE DEITY
BUT IT WAS A TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES BY TINDAL THAT WAS ESTEEMED THE MOST DANGEROUS TO THE ESTABLISHED FAITH THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK COMPOSED WITH LITTLE ACCURACY WAS FOUND LIABLE TO CONSIDERABLE OBJECTIONS
THAT FRANCIS SHOULD EVACUATE GENOA AND ALL THE FORTRESSES HELD BY HIM IN ITALY AND HE DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF BRINGING SFORZA TO A TRIAL AND CONFISCATING THE DUCHY OF MILAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PRETENDED TREASON
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIS NEW MARRIAGE BY THE DEATH OF ANNE BOLEYN MORRIS WESTON BRERETON AND SMETON WERE TRIED BUT NO LEGAL EVIDENCE WAS PRODUCED AGAINST THEM
THE DUKE OF NORFOLK WHO HAD RECEIVED POWERS FOR THAT END FORWARDED THE DISPERSION BY THE PROMISE OF A GENERAL AMNESTY AND THE KING RATIFIED THIS ACT OF CLEMENCY HE PUBLISHED HOWEVER A MANIFESTO AGAINST THE REBELS AND AN ANSWER TO THEIR COMPLAINTS
AND STILL LESS SUITABLE TO MEN OF SUCH UNQUESTIONED BRAVERY CHARLES SOON AFTER INVADED PROVENCE IN PERSON WITH AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN BUT MET WITH NO SUCCESS HIS ARMY PERISHED WITH SICKNESS FATIGUE
AND TO INSPIRE THEM WITH HORROR AGAINST THE UNRELENTING PERSECUTORS BUT THOUGH HENRY NEGLECTED NOT TO PUNISH THE PROTESTANT DOCTRINE WHICH HE DEEMED HERESY HIS MOST FORMIDABLE ENEMIES HE KNEW
BY MARRYING JANE SEYMOUR THE VERY DAY AFTER HER EXECUTION HIS IMPATIENCE TO GRATIFY THIS NEW PASSION CAUSED HIM TO FORGOT ALL REGARD TO DECENCY AND HIS CRUEL HEART WAS NOT SOFTENED A MOMENT BY THE BLOODY CATASTROPHE
AND TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM AT WINDSOR HENRY RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE POSSIBLE AND WITH ALL THE SEEMING CORDIALITY BUT HE RESOLVED NOTWITHSTANDING
IMPATIENT HOWEVER OF A RETREAT WHICH WAS BOTH DISAGREEABLE AND DANGEROUS HE HELD CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS FOLLOWERS HERNE SKELTON AND ASTLEY THREE BROKEN TRADESMEN
HAD SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED THE NATION FOR A BREACH WITH THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF AND MEN HAD PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ABUSES WHICH WERE PLAINLY CALCULATED FOR THE TEMPORAL ADVANTAGES OF THE HIERARCHY AND WHICH THEY FOUND DESTRUCTIVE OF THEIR OWN
WOLSEY HIMSELF CROSSED THE SEA IN ORDER TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH FRANCIS AND TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HE DISPLAYED ALL THAT GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE WITH WHICH HE WAS SO MUCH INTOXICATED
HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO HYSTERICAL FITS WHICH THREW HER BODY INTO UNUSUAL CONVULSIONS AND HAVING PRODUCED AN EQUAL DISORDER IN HER MIND MADE HER UTTER STRANGE SAYINGS WHICH AS SHE WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THEM DURING THE TIME
WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE RIDICULE AND FALSITY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH AS SUPREME PONTIFF
AS HEAD OF THE GERMANIC BODY NOT TO GIVE UMBRAGE HOWEVER TO THE STATES OF ITALY HE PROFESSED HIS INTENTION OF BESTOWING THAT PRINCIPALITY ON SOME PRINCE WHO SHOULD BE OBNOXIOUS TO NO PARTY
SHE DESIRED HIM TO JUDGE THE BEST SHE WAS BEHEADED BY THE EXECUTIONER OF CALAIS
VICAR OF THE PARISH A DESIGNING FELLOW FOUNDED ON THEM A PROJECT FROM WHICH HE HOPED TO ACQUIRE BOTH PROFIT AND CONSIDERATION HE WENT TO WARHAM ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THEN ALIVE
THAT HER RAVINGS WERE INSPIRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST KNAVERY AS IS USUAL SOON AFTER SUCCEEDING TO DELUSION SHE LEARNED TO COUNTERFEIT TRANCES AND SHE THEN UTTERED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TONE
AND HERE THE DOCTOR SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO MORE SECURELY BANDAGE HIS PATIENT'S SHOULDER JACK PENNY LOOKING ON RESTING UPON HIS GUN AND WEARING A COUNTENANCE FULL OF MISERY THERE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JIMMY BUT TURNING MY HEAD
AND ON PARTING THE BOUGHS AND TWIGS WE BOTH STARTED BACK IN HORROR MY BOY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CRIED THE DOCTOR AS I STOOD SPEECHLESS THERE BY HIS SIDE WE HAVE NOT SO MANY FRIENDS THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO KILL THEM
AND NOW RISING INTO QUITE AN ANGRY SHOUT NOW DESCENDING INTO A LOW BUZZ THE TALK TALK TALK WENT ON AS IF THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BUT I CAN SEE NONE UNLESS THE WATER SINKS WE ARE LOST JOE MY LAD YOU MUST ACT LIKE A MAN I'LL TRY DOCTOR I SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE AND AS I SPOKE
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY EVIL WILL RESULT FROM IT HIST HE IS COMING TO OUR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A WHISPER AND WE NOW STOPPED SHORT AND WATCHED THE DOCTOR'S PATIENT IN THE DIM TWILIGHT OF THE CAVERN
I WAS EITHER TO TIE SOMETHING TO HIS COLLAR OR TAKE IT OFF DO NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LOOK THEY ARE LIGHTING A FIRE THE OTHERS MUST HAVE COME BACK
THEN THE CHIEF SAVAGE SPOKE AGAIN IN STERN TONES THERE WAS A BUZZ OF VOICES ONCE MORE AND THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO FILE OUT AND CROSS THE OPENING TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VILLAGE
BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET AWAY JIMMY HOW ARE WE TO ESCAPE BLACK FELLOW HAB BIG TINK HE REPLIED MUCH BIG TINK AND FIND UM WAY
ALL TOP HERE JIMMY GO SEE I QUITE SHARED WITH THE DOCTOR THE FEELING OF HELPLESS ANNOYANCE AT HAVING TO DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE BLACK
LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD
I TURNED SHARPLY TO WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN CURLED UP BUT HE WAS GONE I CREPT A LITTLE WAY IN TWO OR THREE DIRECTIONS BUT HE WAS NOT WITH US AND I SAID SO HOW
AND PROVIDENTIALLY HIT UPON THE RIGHT PLACE AFTER ALL AND THAT THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE MAN LIKELY TO BE A FELLOW PRISONER AND THAT MY POOR FATHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FLEE FARTHER I FELT
WHERE EVEN A BIRD COULD CLIMB AND IN DESPAIR I TOO BEGAN TO STRIP OFF SOME OF MY CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO SWIM SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY I NODDED
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOOLISH SEEING HOW MUCH BETTER I COULD SERVE HIM BY BEING FREE BUT I FELT READY TO HURRY BACK AND SHARE MY FATHER'S CAPTIVITY FOR I FELT ASSURED THAT IT MUST BE HE OF WHOM OUR GUIDE SPOKE
STOOD UP CLEARLY BEFORE US AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GOING ON I FOLLOWED MORE RELUCTANTLY WHEN I REMEMBERED GYP AND CHIRRUPED TO HIM EXPECTING TO FIND HIM AT MY HEELS BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
CLEAR DE BUSH WE HASTILY DREW THE BOUGHS ASIDE AND JIMMY STEADILY DESCENDED THE STEEP SLOPE ENTERED THE RIVULET CROSSED AND THEN STOPPED FOR A MOMENT BENEATH THE OVERHANGING BOUGHS BEFORE CLIMBING TO THE CABIN
TO SEE CRACK AND CREVICE GRADUALLY FILL AND POINT AFTER POINT COVERED BY THE SEETHING WATER WHICH CREPT UP SLOWLY AND INSIDIOUSLY HIGHER AND HIGHER EVEN AS WE WATCHED YES SAID THE DOCTOR
I SAY JOE CARSTAIRS IF I'D KNOWN WE WERE GOING TO BE DROWNED I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ARE YOU SURE IT IS RISING SAID THE DOCTOR BENDING DOWN TO EXAMINE THE LEVEL AN EXAMPLE I FOLLOWED
STOP HIM RUN AFTER HIM HE MUST NOT GO I CRIED I STOPPED FOR THERE WAS A LOW PIPING WHISTLE LIKE THE CRY OF A BLUE MOUNTAIN PARROT BACK AT HOME JACK PENNY I GASPED AND I ANSWERED THE CALL
HE HAD OBTAINED FROM OUR GUIDE THE LATTER CHECKED HIM THOUGH LAYING A HAND UPON HIS ARM AS HE SAID TO ME AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THESE PEOPLE ARE TOO STRONG YOU MUST ESCAPE
AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY DESERVED IT THEN I BEGAN THINKING OF MY OWN FRIENDS AND THEN VERY SELFISHLY NO DOUBT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHT
GET MUCH TOO MUCH WATER MASS JOE HE SAID WHAT UM GOING TO DO I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
FROM HIM WE HAD COME TO SAVE AND WHO WAS LYING BOUND THERE WAITING FOR THE HELP THAT SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD NEVER COME THE DOCTOR REALISED MY FEELINGS FOR HE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND PRESSED MY HAND
AS I FULLY REALISED THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SWEPT AWAY THERE COULD NOT BE A MOMENT'S DOUBT OF THAT
AND THEY'LL COME BACK WITH A LOT OF THEIR WARRIORS TO ATTACK US TO NIGHT AND FIND US GONE AND WHILE THEY ARE GONE JOE WE WILL ATTACK THEIR PLACE AND CARRY OFF OUR PRIZE
THE CHIEF'S HUT HE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN VOLUBLY AND THEN STOPPED AND BENT HIS HEAD AT THE CHIEF'S HUT SAID THE DOCTOR EXCITEDLY WAIT A MOMENT OR TWO TO GIVE HIM TIME TO COLLECT HIMSELF THEN ASK HIM AGAIN
NEAR THE END MY COMPANIONS SEEMED AVERSE TO SPEAKING TO ME OR EACH OTHER BUT WERE EVIDENTLY MOODY AND THOUGHTFUL ALL BUT JIMMY WHO SEEMED TO BE GETTING EXCITED
TO OUR PLACE OF REFUGE AND WHERE A MINUTE BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A ROCKY SHELF THE PATH ALONG WHICH WE HAD COME
SNUFFED AT IT LAPPED A LITTLE AND THREW UP HIS HEAD AGAIN BARKING AND SPLASHING IN IT A LITTLE AS HE RAN IN BREAST HIGH AND CAME BACK AS IF INTIMATING THAT HE WAS
DRYING FAST WHILE THE RIVER MINUTE BY MINUTE WAS GOING DOWN SO THAT WE FELT SURE IF NO STORM CAME TO RENEW THE FLOOD IT
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WE AWAIT OUR FATE I GLANCED FROM THE BLACKS TO THE DOCTOR TO SEE THAT HE WAS INTENTLY GAZING UP THE GORGE WHERE THE RUSHING WATER CAME SEETHING DOWN
TO ME STARING AS IF IN WONDER THE WORDS WERE FELLOW PRISONER AND THEY MADE ME STOP SHORT FOR I FELT THAT I HAD REALLY
AND GYP BEGAN WHINING AND PADDLING ABOUT ASKING US AS IT WERE WITH HIS INTELLIGENT EYES WHETHER WE DID NOT MEAN TO START HI GYP GYP SHOUTED JIMMY JUST THEN
YES AND ONE OF THEM WAS APPROACHING IT JUST NOW WHEN JACK PENNY SHOT HIM DOWN THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE WHERE WHAT CLOSE HERE I HAD TAKEN HIS HAND TO LEAD HIM TO THE CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE POOR WRETCH LAY
I WHISPERED ONCE OR TWICE TO THE DOCTOR BUT HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY LIPS I TURNED TO JIMMY BUT HE HAD CROUCHED DOWN AND WAS RESTING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT
AND APPARENTLY BENT ON GETTING US AWAY I CAUGHT SUCH WORDS AS FEVER PRISONER MY HEAD YEARS MISERY DESPAIR ALWAYS
BETTER THE LONG ANXIETY I THOUGHT OF WATCHING AND WAITING FOR MY RETURN THAN TO KNOW I HAD BEEN KILLED LIKE THIS BUT I'M NOT KILLED YET I THOUGHT AS THE BLOOD FLUSHED TO MY FACE
THE VOICES SEEMED SO NEAR NOW THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TOO FAR AND JUST THEN JIMMY RAISED HIS HAND AND STOPPED US BEFORE WHAT SEEMED TO BE A PATCH OF BLACK DARKNESS
CHAPTER THIRTY NINE HOW WE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND AND FOUND IT WAS TIME TO GO THAT NEXT EVENING SEEMED AS IT WOULD NEVER COME
BUT WE ARE IN THE SHADOW FROM HUTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT WE COULD HEAR TALKING BUT THAT IN FRONT OF US WAS SILENT AND I BEGAN WONDERING WHETHER IT WAS THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN MY PRISON BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
AND WARMTH WAS RAPIDLY RESTORED TO OUR LIMBS BY ROCKS THAT SOON GREW HEATED IN THE TORRID RAYS BIG BUNYIP GOT NO MORE WATER ALL GONE DIS TIME SAID JIMMY CALMLY
THERE WERE FOUR WHO WERE PRETTY CLOSE UPON MY HEELS ONE OF WHOM HURLED
AS HIGH AS WE COULD ON LEDGES AND BLOCKS OF STONE
CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING SHARPLY I SAW THE MEANING OF THE PROLONGATION OF THE THUNDER FOR A GREAT WAVE AT LEAST TEN FEET HIGH RUDDY FOAMING AND FULL OF TOSSING BRANCHES CAME RUSHING DOWN THE GORGE
WE COULD NOT TELL FOR HOW LONG WHILE ON TAKING A HASTY GLANCE AT OUR POSITION IT WAS THIS OVERHEAD THE SHELVING ROCK QUITE IMPASSABLE
ROOFS SHOWED FROM THE OUTSIDE NAMES AN OLD NORSE STORY SAYS MOST MEN HAD TWO NAMES IN ONE AND THOUGHT IT LIKELIEST TO LEAD TO LONG LIFE AND GOOD LUCK TO HAVE DOUBLE NAMES
AND TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW WAS THE BLACK WATER OF THE FIORD OLAF WATCHED HIM FOR A WHILE THEN HE SAID NO WHITENING OF YOUR CHEEK HARALD GOOD A BOY THAT CAN FACE THE FALL OF AEGIR'S ROCK
THE FAITHFULNESS TO PLIGHTED WORD
MUCH PETTING FOSTER BROTHERS
FAR OFF IT LOOKS FLAT BUT WHEN YOU WALK UPON IT THERE ARE GREAT HOLES AND CRACKS WE COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND THERE SEEMS TO BE ONLY A FRINGE OF LAND AROUND THE EDGE OF AN ISLAND OF ICE THE WINTER NIGHTS WERE VERY LONG
THORSTEIN MEANS THOR'S STONE THORKEL MEANS THOR'S FIRE THORBIORN MEANS THOR'S BEAR GUDBRAND MEANS GUNNR'S SWORD
THE MOTHER COUNTRY IT IS REALLY AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER AS FOR THE OTHER STORIES THEY ARE DISTINCTLY STEPS IN THE PROGRESS OF THE PLOT
ERIC LAUGHED DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY THAT GUNNBIORN TOLD
WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO FACE THE WAR FLASH WHEN HE IS A MAN HO I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE WAR FLASH NOW CRIED HARALD HE THREW BACK HIS CAPE AND DREW A LITTLE DAGGER FROM HIS BELT
IT SENDS OUT A COLD BREATH SAID ONE OF THE MEN THEY ALL WRAPPED THEIR CLOAKS ABOUT THEM IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE SAID ERIC THE WHITE MAST STANDS AS HIGH AS A HILL
HALL AND SET THEM BEFORE THE BENCHES THEN THEY LAID LONG BOARDS ACROSS FROM TRESTLE TO TRESTLE
NOR IN ME SHOUTED THORKEL
IT WAS TWO FEET LONG AND SHARP ON BOTH EDGES WHILE THE IRON WAS HOT HE BEAT INTO IT SOME RUNES WHEN THE MEN IN THE SMITHY SAW THE RUNES THEY OPENED THEIR EYES WIDE AND LOOKED AT THE BOY FOR FEW NORSEMEN COULD READ WHAT DOES IT SAY
VOICES WERE LOUD ARMS WERE SWINGING IT WAS AN UNJUST DECISION SOME ONE CRIED ERIC KILLED THE MEN IN FAIR FIGHT THE JUDGES OUTLAWED HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID HIS FOE THORGEST HAS MANY RICH AND POWERFUL MEN TO BACK HIM
NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
ERIC STROLLED INTO HIS HOUSE AND CALLED FOR SUPPER WHEN THE DRINKING HORNS HAD BEEN FILLED AND EMPTIED ERIC PULLED HIMSELF UP AND SMILED AND SHOUTED OUT SO THAT THE GREAT ROOM WAS FULL OF HIS BIG VOICE
THEY TOOK HORSES AND CATTLE WITH THEM AND ALL KINDS OF TOOLS AND FOOD I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHERE THIS LAND IS ERIC SAID GUNNBIORN SAID ONLY THAT HE SAILED EAST WHEN HE CAME HOME TO ICELAND SO I WILL STEER STRAIGHT WEST
AND EVERYWHERE MEN RECEIVED HIM GLADLY FOR HE WAS HANDSOME AND WISE BUT AT LAST HE CAME NEAR NORWAY THEN HE STOOD UP BEFORE THE PILOT'S SEAT AND SANG LOUDLY
NORSE STORY IS ONLY ONE CHAPTER IN THAT TALE OF AMERICAN DISCOVERY
HE WENT DOWN SLIDING AND JUMPING AND TEARING HIMSELF ON THE SHARP STONES WITH A LAST LEAP
NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY
A NORSE FATHER SENT HIS CHILDREN AWAY FROM HOME TO GROW UP THEY WENT WHEN THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD AND STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE GROWN THE FATHER THOUGHT
SO THAT DRAGONS SEEMED TO BE CRAWLING ACROSS OR EAGLES SEEMED TO BE SWOOPING DOWN THE GUESTS WALKED IN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH THEIR BIG VOICES SO THAT THE RAFTERS RANG
MANY COME TO NORWAY TO TRADE BUT THEY SELDOM COME TO THE KING'S HALL I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LAND COME UP AND SPEAK WITH ME SO LEIF WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE HIGH SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY THE KING AND TALKED WITH HIM
FOR A WEEK OR MORE THEY STAYED IN HIS WOODS SOMETIMES IN A SECRET CAVE OF HIS WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THORGEST WAS ABOUT
FOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED WAS THE THICK OUTSIDE WALL
AND THE DRINKING HORNS WENT ROUND IN A CLEAN ROOM BEDS AROUND THE SIDES OF THE FEAST HALL WERE SHUT BEDS THEY WERE LIKE BIG BOXES WITH DOORS OPENING INTO THE HALL
THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
HERE HUNG THE SHIELDS OF THE GUESTS FOR EVERY MAN WHEN HE WAS GIVEN HIS PLACE TURNED AND HUNG HIS SHIELD BEHIND HIM AND SET HIS TALL SPEAR BY IT SO ON EACH WALL THERE WAS A LONG ROW OF GAY SHIELDS
RED AND GREEN AND YELLOW AND ALL SHINING WITH GOLD OR BRONZE TRIMMINGS AND HIGHER UP THERE WAS ANOTHER ROW OF GLEAMING SPEAR POINTS
OUR SWORDS ARE SISTERS IN BLOOD AND WE ARE BROTHERS IN ADVENTURE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY HEART TO DO HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND HIS FACE GLOWED THEN HE LAUGHED AS HE LOOKED AT HIS MEN
BUT WHEN THE TABLES WERE GONE AND THE HORNS WERE GOING AROUND HE STOOD UP AND RAISED HIGH A HORN OF ALE AND SAID LOUDLY THIS HORN OF MEMORY I DRINK IN HONOR OF MY FATHER HALFDAN SON OF GUDROD
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS POSSIBLY THIS BOOK SEEMS MADE UP OF FOUR OR FIVE DISCONNECTED STORIES THEY ARE HOWEVER STRUNG UPON ONE THREAD THE WESTWARD EMIGRATION FROM NORWAY
AND MEN HANDED THEM ON TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS
THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER THERE ARE NO MEN THERE COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND
SCOUR EVERY DISH UNTIL IT SHINES THEN HARALD SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THAT COUNTRY TO HIS KINSMEN AND FRIENDS BID THEM COME IN THREE MONTHS TIME TO DRINK MY FATHER'S
BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA NOTHING GREW ON THEM WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY IT IS A LAND OF ICE
HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
ITS NAME IS VALHALLA IT HAS FIVE HUNDRED DOORS THE RAFTERS ARE SPEARS THE ROOF IS THATCHED WITH SHIELDS ARMOR LIES ON THE BENCHES
AEGIR THE BIG HANDED THEY CALLED HIM IN MANY A BATTLE HIS SWORD HAD SUNG AND HE HAD SENT MANY WARRIORS TO VALHALLA MANY SWORDS HAD BIT INTO HIS FLESH AND LEFT MARKS THERE BUT NEVER A ONE HAD STRUCK HIM TO DEATH
MOST OF THE LAND IN OLD NORWAY WAS COVERED WITH FORESTS WHEN A MAN GOT NEW LAND HE HAD TO CLEAR OFF THE TREES IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS A MAN DID NOT HAVE A SURNAME THAT BELONGED TO EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY
ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND SO OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
I WILL FIGHT FOR MY FOSTER BROTHER WHENEVER HE SHALL NEED ME IF HE IS KILLED BEFORE I AM I WILL PUNISH THE MAN WHO DID IT WHATEVER THINGS I OWN ARE AS MUCH MY FOSTER BROTHER'S AS MINE
DOES THIS NOT FLASH LIKE A SWORD AND I AM NOT AFRAID BUT AFTER ALL THIS IS A BABY THING WHEN I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD I WILL HAVE A SWORD A SHARP TOOTH OF WAR HE SWUNG HIS DAGGER AS THOUGH IT WERE A LONG SWORD
HE SAID WE WILL TRY IT
I WILL GO TO THE KING HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A KING THERE WERE NO KINGS IN ICELAND OR IN GREENLAND SO HE WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE KING HAD HIS FINE HOUSE THE KING'S NAME WAS OLAF
I HAVE NOT OFTEN INTERRUPTED INCIDENT WITH SPECIAL DESCRIPTION NOT BECAUSE I DO NOT CONSIDER THE GETTING OF VIVID AND DETAILED IMAGES MOST NECESSARY TO FULL ENJOYMENT
UDO AND I HERE SHE SQUEEZED THE HAND AND FINDING IT WAS CORONEL'S TOOK UDO'S BOLDLY WITHOUT ANY MORE MAIDENLY NONSENSE UDO AND I LOVE EACH OTHER SAY SOMETHING UDO
WHO PUT THIS ENCHANTMENT ON ME IT WAS I I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE YOU HERE INTERFERING WITH MY PLANS YOUR PLANS TO ROB THE PRINCESS
HE SEEMED TO BE ENVYING THE KING SUCH AN ADVENTURE AN ADVENTURE AFTER HIS OWN HEART MERRIWIG WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HE WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHETHER TO ORDER HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVE US MY CHILD
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
NO MATTER DEAR WE CAN EASILY FIND YOU PLENTY MORE SUITORS INDEED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR MY THOUGHTS LATELY WE'LL ARRANGE A LITTLE COMPETITION AND LET THEM KNOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THERE'LL BE NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
SHE HAD LENT THE RING TO NOBODY TRUE
WAIT TILL HE HAS SEEN THEM MY DEAR SAID MERRIWIG WITH A CHUCKLE HE HAS SEEN THEM FATHER WHAT YOU INVITED HIM HERE
NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE HE WAITED NERVOUSLY WONDERING IF HYACINTH WOULD REALISE THAT ALL WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE MORE PARTICULARLY BELVANE HYACINTH DREW A STOOL UP TO HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND SAT DOWN VERY CLOSE TO HIM
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
THERE ARE CERTAIN STATE REASONS HE SAID WITH DIGNITY WHY THAT STORY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GET ABOUT PARDON YOUR MAJESTY I HAVE NO WISH TO BUT AS YOU KNOW SO MUCH YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW ALL
THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE WORD ABOUT IT MENTIONED UNTIL YOU PUSHED YOUR WAY IN JUST NOW
YOU WILL LEAVE ME LIKE THIS ONE'S ACTIONS ARE VERY MUCH MISUNDERSTOOD SIGHED BELVANE I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THAT IS HOW IT WILL APPEAR
BUT IT CAN BE VERY FUNNY CAN'T IT SAID BELVANE COAXINGLY I WISHED FOR SOMETHING HUMOROUS TO HAPPEN TO YOU
EQUALLY CERTAIN WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION THE BAD WISH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM
FATHER SHE SAID STROKING HIS HAND WHERE IT RESTED ON HIS KNEE I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU NOTHING ABOUT THE COUN NOTHING SERIOUS I HOPE SAID MERRIWIG IN ALARM
NEATLY TIED UP WITH BLUE RIBBON FATHER HE PICKED OUT THE LEFT ONE FONS ET ORIGO IF HE HAD KNOWN ANY LATIN OF THE WAR AND HELD IT UP FOR HYACINTH'S INSPECTION THERE YOU CAN SEE THE PLACE WHERE HENRY SMALLNOSE'S ARROW BENT IT
IT WAS MORE THAN UDO DID JUST NOW HE WAS WITH HER IN HER GARDEN TELLING HER FOR THE FIFTH TIME AN EXTRAORDINARILY DULL STORY ABOUT AN ENCOUNTER OF HIS WITH A DRAGON APPARENTLY IN ITS DOTAGE TO WHICH BELVANE WAS LISTENING WITH AN INTEREST WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE NARRATOR
BY THE WAY WHO IS HE HE COMES FROM ARABY AND HIS NAME IS UDO OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF HIM AN EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENT MY DEAR IT ISN'T UDO I'M AFRAID FATHER IT'S CORONEL
AND HIS BOYISH PLEASURE IN IT ALL WAS SO EVIDENT AND SO INNOCENT
THIS IS NOT A MORAL WORK AN HOUR LATER WIGGS CAME INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN EAGER TO DISCOVER IN WHAT WAY HER INABILITY TO RHYME WOULD MANIFEST ITSELF
BUT SUDDENLY SHE REMEMBERED
THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR PRECIOUS COUNTESS WHOM YOU EXPECT ME TO MARRY HOW VERY UNKIND OF HER A NASTY PERSON TO ANNOY HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
CORONEL SHOOK HIM SOLEMNLY BY THE HAND I CONGRATULATE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS I WILL ANNOUNCE YOUR DECISION TO THE PRINCESS SHE WILL BE MUCH AMU MUCH DELIGHTED AND HE TURNED INTO THE PALACE
I SHOULD NOT RECORD IT OF HER WERE NOT ROGER SO INSISTENT NOW
TO HYACINTH HE SEEMED THE DEAREST OF FATHERS AND THE MOST WONDERFUL OF KINGS AND BY AND BY THE MOMENT CAME OF WHICH CORONEL HAD SPOKEN AND NOW SAID MERRIWIG
HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
LET ME SEE THERE'S THAT SEVEN HEADED BULL HE'S GETTING A LITTLE OLD NOW BUT HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LAST ONE WE MIGHT I DON'T WANT A SUITOR SAID HYACINTH SOFTLY I HAVE ONE MERRIWIG LEANT FORWARD WITH EAGERNESS
THE COUNTESS LOOKED AT HIM CRITICALLY WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE NO SHE SAID THAT'S QUITE WRONG NATURALLY I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE
HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO JOLLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF SO JUST FOR FUN LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING TO PAY HER OUT I FEEL I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY TO DAY ALL RIGHT WE WON'T HURT HER WE'LL HUMOUR HER
AND SO YOU I UNDERSTAND WISH TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER DOES THAT SURPRISE YOUR MAJESTY WELL NO IT DOESN'T AND SHE I UNDERSTAND WISHES TO MARRY YOU YES PLEASE FATHER
I CAN'T PLANT THEM IN THE GARDEN I THOUGHT WE MIGHT RUN THEM UP THE FLAGSTAFF AS WE DID IN BARODIA ISN'T THAT A LITTLE UNKIND NOW THAT THE POOR MAN'S DEAD MERRIWIG LOOKED ROUND HIM TO SEE THAT THERE WERE NO EAVESDROPPERS
BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
HE CAME TO STAY WITH YOU AND HE NEVER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PUT IN CORONEL HAS GIVEN HIS AFFECTIONS TO ANOTHER AHA SO THAT'S THE SECRET NOW I WONDER IF I CAN GUESS WHO SHE IS
SHE HELD HER BREATH EXPECTING A THUNDERCLAP OR SOME OTHER OUTWARD TOKEN
HE TOLD HER OF HIS SECRET JOURNEY TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S TENT HE TOLD HER OF THE KING OF BARODIA'S LETTER
WITH MORE CONTROL OVER HER COUNTENANCE THAN THE OTHERS
WERE IN HIS POCKET DAYS OF HONOURED LEISURE WERE WAITING FOR HIM HE GAZED AT EACH REMEMBERED LANDMARK OF HIS OWN BELOVED COUNTRY HIS HEART OVERFLOWING WITH THANKFULNESS NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE LEAVE EURALIA HOW GOOD TO SEE HYACINTH AGAIN
AND ROGER SCURVILEGS WHO TAKE THESE NARROW MATTER OF FACT VIEWS ONE MERELY WASTES TIME IN ARGUING WITH THEM MY PLANS SHE REPEATED
OF OUR MOTHERS AND WIVES AND DAUGHTERS PROLONGED CHEERING AS THE CASE MAY BE HEAR HEAR
SAID UDO STIFFLY WELL PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT I HOPE THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU ON THE WAY UDO WHO WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PALACE TURNED ROUND WITH A STARTLED LOOK WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THAT IT WAS TRULY A MAGIC RING AS THE FAIRY HAD TOLD HER SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HER WISH WAS A BAD ONE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BAD ENOUGH TO EARN IT SHE WAS
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET HE ASKED MYSTERIOUSLY OF COURSE SAID HYACINTH DECIDING AT ONCE THAT IT WOULD NOT MATTER IF SHE ONLY TOLD CORONEL WELL THEN LISTEN
THEY JUST GO TO THE PRIEST AND CONFESS YOU KNOW AND WIPE IT ALL OUT AND START FRESH AGAIN ON A CAREER OF CRIME NEXT MORNING I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER GO ABROAD THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FIT TO LIVE IN IS ENGLAND
STILL YOU GO TO SCHLANGENBAD ON MONDAY THAT'S THE POINT ON MONDAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE JOURNEY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO BE RID OF THE MINX I'M GLAD AS IT IS INDEED

CONSOLS IT APPEARED WERE CERTAIN TO GIVE WAY FOR POLITICAL REASONS
PERHAPS MY BEWILDERMENT SHOWED ITSELF UPON MY FACE FOR AT LAST HE LOOKED QUEERLY AT ME YOU DON'T QUITE LIKE THIS I'M AFRAID HE SAID BREAKING OFF SHORT I WAS THE SOUL OF BUSINESS NOT AT ALL I ANSWERED I AM AN AUTOMATON
I CONFESS AT ONCE THAT PEOPLE COME TO SWITZERLAND TO TOUR AND ARE THEREFORE LIABLE TO NEED OUR MACHINES
MY LETTERS TO THE DAILY TELEPHONE GAVE SATISFACTION MY EMPLOYER WROTE YOU ARE A BORN JOURNALIST I CONFESS THIS SURPRISED ME FOR I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF A TRUTHFUL PERSON STILL AS HE EVIDENTLY MEANT IT FOR PRAISE
AGAIN THE CHIEF THINGS OF THE ANCIENT MOUNTAINS AND THE PRECIOUS THINGS OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THE ANCIENT MOUNTAINS ARE CLEARLY THE ROCKIES CAN THE EVERLASTING HILLS BE ANYTHING BUT THE HIMALAYAS
HE WAS ABSURDLY ANXIOUS TO HUMOUR US JUST AT FIRST IT IS TRUE HE HAD DISCUSSED THE SUBJECTS THAT LAY NEAREST TO HIS OWN HEART
I THINK YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BEFORE ONE THAT CANNOT BE PUT OFF QUITE SO VERY WELL THEN YES WE ARE BOTH AT YOUR SERVICE THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR A SEAT I PUSHED HIM OUR ONE EASY CHAIR

WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
I'VE SPENT HOUAHS AND HOUAHS FEEDING MY SOUL IN THE GALLERIES AND WHAT PARTICULAR PAINTER DOES YOUR SOUL MOST FEED UPON I ASKED BLUNTLY WITH A SMILE THE QUESTION STAGGERED HIM
AND ACCORDING TO HER ALMOST EVERYBODY'S A FOOL ESPECIALLY HER RELATIONS THERE'S A FINE KNACK OF SWEEPING GENERALISATION ABOUT DEAH SKINNY OLD GEORGEY
HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST LANDED FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HIS FIGURE WAS THAT OF MISTER EDWARD GIBBON YES MADAM HE SAID IN A MARKEDLY DEFERENTIAL TONE FUSSING ABOUT WITH THE RIM OF HIS HAT AS HE SPOKE AND ADJUSTING HIS PINCE NEZ
THIS MAN MEANS MISCHIEF THERE IS DANGER AHEAD WHEN A CREATURE OF HIGGINSON'S SORT WHO HAS RISEN TO BE A COUNT AND A FASHIONABLE PHYSICIAN DESCENDS AGAIN TO BE A COURIER
I CALLED THEM CUSTOMERS ELSIE MAINTAINED THAT WE OUGHT RATHER TO SAY CLIENTS BEING BY TEMPERAMENT AVERSE TO SECTARIANISM I DID NOT DISPUTE THE POINT WITH HER WE REPOSED ON OUR LAURELS IN VAIN
SO AS TO SECURE GOOD BERTHS AND STILL MORE UNFORTUNATELY IN A LETTER TO LADY GEORGINA I HAD CHANCED TO MENTION THE NAME OF OUR SHIP AND THE DATE OF THE VOYAGE I KEPT UP A SPASMODIC CORRESPONDENCE WITH LADY GEORGINA NOWADAYS

I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE GEORGINA IT OUGHT TO BE MADE PENAL TO SEND INNOCENT GIRLS INTO THE WORLD SO BURDENED MY OPINION TO A T YOU ARE REALLY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMAN THERE'S MY NAME AND ADDRESS
WE CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND THAT THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY OF ENGLAND DEPENDS UPON THE PROMISES MADE TO ABRAHAM I ASSENTED WITHOUT COMMITTING MYSELF IT WOULD SEEM TO FOLLOW MISTER ASHURST ENCOURAGED BY SO MUCH ASSENT
WE HANDED HIM OUR PRINTED TARIFF HE SEEMED SATISFIED COULD YOU SPARE ME AN HOUR THIS MORNING HE ASKED STILL FINGERING HIS HAT NERVOUSLY WITH HIS PUFFY HAND BUT PERHAPS YOU ARE ENGAGED I FEAR I INTRUDE UPON YOU
WHAT YOU ARE THEN LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY HE CRIED STRIKING AN ATTITUDE INDEED MILADI YOUR ADMIRABLE HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO EXERT HIS INFLUENCE IN MY FAVOUR AT VIENNA
IN POINT OF FACT HE DROPPED HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER I WANT YOU TO DRAW UP MY WILL FOR ME
I CAN'T REMEMBAH THE OTHAH FELLAHS NAMES HE WENT ON THEY'RE ALL SO MUCH ALIKE ALL IN ELLI DON'T YAH KNOW BUT I RECOLLECT AT THE TIME
AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
SO WHEN THE COLONEL DIED IN THE YEAR I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO MOURNING FOR HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE CHOSE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MY ALLOWANCE WAS DUE
WITHOUT CIRCUMLOCUTION WE WERE GOING TO START AN ENGLISH TYPEWRITING OFFICE IN FLORENCE WHAT WAS THE ORDINARY WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME POSSESSED OF A TYPEWRITING MACHINE WITHOUT THE ODIOUS AND MERCENARY PRELIMINARY OF PAYING FOR IT
SHE THINKS ME A VERY SPECIAL AND PECULIAH FOOL HE WENT ON CRUMBLING HIS BREAD LADY GEORGINA I ANSWERED IS A PERSON OF EXCEPTIONAL DISCRIMINATION
TWO ANCIENT LADIES WERE SEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALREADY VERY GRAND LOOKING DAMES WITH THE HAUGHTY AND EXCLUSIVE UGLINESS OF THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY IN ITS LATER STAGES
AND SO FORTH I BREATHED AGAIN AT LEAST I HAD NOT BEEN CALLED UPON TO DISINHERIT HAROLD PROVIDED ALWAYS HE WENT ON IN THE SAME VOICE I WONDERED WHAT WAS COMING PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT
I DON'T OBJECT TO GOING TO SCHLANGENBAD I WOULD CONVOY YOU OVER AS COMPANION OR LADY HELP OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT I WOULD REMAIN WITH YOU THERE FOR A WEEK TILL YOU COULD ARRANGE WITH YOUR GRETCHEN PRESUMABLY UNSOPHISTICATED
AND MANY LEADING FINANCIERS IN THE CITY OF LONDON
TO A COURTESY LORD THE ELDEST SON OF A PEER NATURE HAD ENDOWED HER WITH THE PROFOUND BRITISH BELIEF THAT PEERS SHOULD BE SPOKEN OF IN CHOICE AND PECULIAR LANGUAGE IF A PEER'S A FOOL LADY GEORGINA SAID ONCE TO ME
AND ARGENTINE CENTRAL WERE LIKELY TO BE WEAK BUT PROVINCIALS MUST SOON BECOME COMMENDABLY FIRM AND IF URUGUAYS WENT FLAT SOMETHING GOOD OUGHT TO BE MADE OUT OF THEM SCOTCH RAILS MIGHT SHORTLY BE QUIET I ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE BASED UPON SLEEPERS
AND THE EMPIRE FOR NOTHING I JUDGED AS MUCH I ANSWERED
THE SAID HAROLD ASHURST TILLINGTON CONSENTS TO MARRY I THINK THAT SOUNDS BETTER HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH FATHERLY REGARD THAT IT PRICKED MY HEART EVER TO HAVE POKED FUN AT HIS INTERPRETATION OF PROPHECY ON STOCK EXCHANGE PRINCIPLES I THINK I FLUSHED CRIMSON NO
A COLD DRAUGHT RUNS SO OFTEN ALONG THE FLOOR IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES THIS IS KENT THAT WE TRAVERSE AH THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND AS A DIPLOMAT HE KNEW EVERY NOOK OF EUROPE AND HE ECHOED THE MOT HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY HEARD DROP FROM MADAME'S LIPS ON THE PLATFORM
PAUSING IN HER PAPERING WITH HER SLEEVES ROLLED UP THEY CALLED ME BROWNIE PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY DARK COMPLEXION BUT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME WE ALL KNEW THAT LONG AGO
OBSEQUIOUS POLITENESS ONE'S CANTANKEROUS THE OTHER'S ONLY PERNICKETTY IT'S ONE TUNE AFTER ALL IN TWO DIFFERENT KEYS FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS A DAILY VISITOR
YOU HEARD OF HIM I SUPPOSE FROM GEORGINA GEORGINA IS PREJUDICED HE HAS COME BACK TO ME I AM GLAD TO SAY AN EXCELLENT SERVANT HIGGINSON THOUGH A TRIFLE TOO OMNISCIENT
CASSANDRA HAD RETURNED AND HER GRATUITOUS NEIGHBORLY OFFICES WERE AT AN END THE GIRL WAS STOOPING BEFORE THE FIRE ARRANGING A CAKE OF CORN BREAD TO COOK IN THE ASHES A CRANE SWUNG OVER THE FLAMES ON WHICH A FAT IRON KETTLE WAS HUNG
AND HOW SOME PEOPLE HAD TO LIVE IN PLACES LIKE THIS ALWAYS AND HER HEART FILLED WITH A LARGE PITY FOR THEM HERE ONLY A SMALL TRIANGLE OF BLUE SKY COULD BE SEEN NOT A TREE NOT A BIT OF EARTH
HE CAME AND LAID HIS ARM ACROSS DAVID'S SHOULDERS AND THE ACT SOFTENED THE SLIGHT STING OF HIS WORDS AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A POET NOT THAT SAID THE YOUNG MAN HUMBLY
AND THEY WERE RATTLED AWAY OVER THE ROUGH PAVING A LONG LONELY RIDE THROUGH THE WONDERFUL CITY SO MANY MILES OF HOUSES AND SPLENDID BUILDINGS OF GARDENS AND MONUMENTS STRANGELY THE PEOPLE OF VANITY FAIR LEAPED OUT OF THE BOOK SHE HAD READ
WHILE IN OPEN SPACES THE SUN BEAT WARMLY DOWN UPON HER THE TRAIL LED BY MANY STEEP SCRAMBLES AND SHARP DESCENTS MORE DIRECTLY TO HER HOME THAN THE ROAD WHICH WOUND AND TURNED SO FREQUENTLY AS TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THE DISTANCE
HER FACE REMAINED IMPASSIVE AND HER VOICE DRONED ON MONOTONOUSLY BUT TWO TEARS STOLE DOWN HER WRINKLED CHEEKS
HALF DRESSED AS SHE WAS AND MURMURED PRETTY COOING PHRASES KISSING AND CUDDLING HIM TO CONTENTED LAUGHTER BETTY TOWERS HAD PROCURED CLOTHING FOR HER A MODEST SUPPLY
HE MOVED SWIFTLY AWAY HE WAS A YOUTH AGAIN HUNGRY AND SAD STUMBLING ALONG THE UNTRODDEN WAY AVOIDING THE BEATEN PATH YET UNERRINGLY TAKING HIS COURSE TOWARD THE CLEFT ROCK AT THE HEAD OF THE FALL BEHIND THE GREAT HOLLY TREE
OUGHT SHE THEN TO ARRIVE ATTENDED BY A MAID CARRYING HER BABY BUT DAVID WOULD KNOW SHE DID NOT NEED ONE BRINGING HIM HIS LITTLE SON IN HER OWN ARMS WHAT WOULD HE CARE FOR ANYTHING MORE SO THE ADDRESS WAS GIVEN THE CABMAN
HE KNOWED HE HADN'T OUGHT TO RILE ME LIKE HE DONE I BE'N TRYIN TO MAKE HIS HOSS GO HOME
TO DROP DOWN THERE WOULD MEAN INSTANT DEATH ON THE ROCKS BELOW IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE ALMOST AS HORRIBLE AS THE STRANGLING ROPE HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY WERE ON HIM AND THEN
THUS ENABLING HIM TO SEE PLAINLY WHAT WAS TRANSPIRING ABOUT THE HOUSE AND SHEDS WITHOUT HIMSELF BEING SEEN LONG AND PATIENTLY HE WAITED ONCE A DOG BARKED HIS OWN DOG NIG SOME ONE MUST BE APPROACHING
LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A SINGULARLY INNOCENT AND APPEALING EXPRESSION BUT GRADUALLY AS HE SAW HER IMPASSIVE AND UNRELENTING FACE HIS OWN RESUMED A HARD AND SULLEN LOOK WHICH MADE HIM APPEAR YEARS OLDER HIS FOREHEAD WAS DAMP AND COLD
THE OLD SERVANT WAS SAYING
THAT HE MIGHT GO IN AND DO WHAT HE COULD TO HELP THE PATIENT IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH RETURN FOR THE KINDNESS SHOWN HIM HE FEARED TO OFFER MONEY FOR HIS LODGMENT AT LEAST UNTIL HE COULD FIND A WAY AT LAST FULL OF NEW VIGOR AND VERY HUNGRY
HE CLIMBED RAPIDLY UP THROUGH THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND STOOD AT HER SIDE BREATHING QUICKLY FOR A MOMENT THEY WAITED THUS REGARDING EACH OTHER NEITHER SPEAKING THE BOY HE SEEMED LITTLE MORE THAN A YOUTH
A CHILL STRUCK TO HER BONES AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE VAST CLOSED ROOMS
THAT THE REASON I CANNOT TAKE HER WITH ME NOW IS THAT OUR GREAT FRIENDS OVER THERE ARE TOO SMALL TO UNDERSTAND HER NATURE AND MIGHT DESPISE HER I MUST GO TO MY MOTHER FIRST AND FEEL MY WAY SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
AND A DELICATE PROFILE CUT IN PURE CLEAN LINES MELTING INTO THROAT AND GENTLY ROUNDED BREAST LIKE A SPIRIT NOW HERE NOW GONE AGAIN NEAR AND BENDING OVER HIM A MINISTERING SPIRIT BRINGING HIM FOOD
ABOVE HIS HEAD LAID UPON CROSS BEAMS WERE BUNDLES OF WOOL UNCARDED AND CARDING BOARDS HUNG FROM NAILS IN THE LOGS IN ONE CORNER WAS A RUDELY CONSTRUCTED REEL AND FROM THE LOOM DANGLED THE IDLE SHUTTLE FILLED WITH FINE BLUE YARN OF WOOL
HOYLE HAD BEEN PLACED IN A SMALL WARD WHERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER LITTLE BEDS BOTH OCCUPIED WITH ONE NURSE TO ATTEND ON THE THREE PATIENTS ONE OF THEM HAD BROKEN HIS LEG AND HAD TO LIE IN A CAST AND THE OTHER
I THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR TROUBLE BUT NOW DOCTOR SHALL WE RETURN TO YOUR HOUSE I MUST TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO ADJUST MY MIND TO THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS
HE WAR MEAN AN' AN' HE'S DADE I RECKON HE'S DADE
THE DOCTOR TURNED THE PAPER OVER AND REGARDED IT A MOMENT SHOW ME THE WINDOW I I SEE NO WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AGAIN THE THREE LITTLE INVALIDS LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY AT THEIR VISITOR
WHAT IF THEY SHOULD SET NIG TO TRACK HIM AH HE WOULD STRANGLE THE BEAST AND PITCH HIM OVER THE FALL HE WOULD SPRING OVER AFTER HIM BEFORE HE WOULD LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN AND HANGED OH HE COULD FEEL THE STRANGLING ROPE AROUND HIS NECK ALREADY HE COULD NOT BEAR IT
THE LOOM SHED FOR BETWEEN THE TWO WINDOWS STOOD A CLOTH LOOM LEFT JUST AS IT HAD BEEN USED THE WARP LIKE A TIGHTLY STRETCHED VEIL OF WHITE THREADS AND THE WEB OF CLOTH BEGUN IN ONE CORNER WERE A FEW BUNDLES OF COTTON
AND A LOCK OF SILKEN BLACK HAIR SLIGHTLY CURLING OVER IT INCREASED ITS WHITENESS DARK HEAVY RINGS WERE UNDER HIS EYES WHICH GLEAMED BLUE AS THE SKY BETWEEN LONG DARK LASHES HIS ARMS DROPPED LISTLESSLY AT HIS SIDE
OR CUT HIS COAT AFTER ANY PATTERN OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY CONVENTIONAL LINES EVEN THE BOYS ON THE STREET WILL FLING STONES AT HIM HER PATRONIZING FRIENDS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST POLITELY RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS SHE IS PROUD AND SENSITIVE
ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OPEN AND THE CONTENTS PLACED IN A THICK LAYER OVER THE LONG BENCH ON WHICH HE HAD SLEPT AND COVERED WITH A BLUE AND WHITE HOMESPUN COUNTERPANE THE HEAD HAD BEEN BUILT HIGH WITH IT AND SHEETS SPREAD OVER ALL
LIKELY SHE DONE BROKE HER HIP IS CASS THAR NOW
AS HE FORCED A PATH THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A MOUNTAIN STREAM AND SEEKING IT HE FOLLOWED ALONG ITS ROCKY BED LEAPING FROM ONE HUGE BLOCK OF STONE TO ANOTHER AND SWINGING HIMSELF ACROSS BY GREAT OVERHANGING SYCAMORE BOUGHS
DOCTOR HOYLE YOU'LL ACCOMPANY US AT MY REQUEST UNDOUBTEDLY YOU ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR YOUNG FRIEND MECHANICALLY DAVID WALKED WITH THE TWO OLDER MEN FILLED WITH A STRANGE SINKING OF THE HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH A VAGUE ELATION
THE CRY WAS REPEATED A LITTLE LOUDER
YOU DONE SO BAD SHE WON'T LOOK AT YE NO MORE I RECKON
HE PULLED DAVID DOWN AND WHISPERED THE QUESTION IN HIS EAR NO NO SHE ONLY MEANS THAT YOU'RE A DEAR QUEER LITTLE CHAP
HE SAT THUS WHILE THE LAWYER READ A LENGTHY DOCUMENT AND AT THE END PERSONALLY ADDRESSED HIM THEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD WHAT IS THIS MY UNCLE MY UNCLE GONE TOO
ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE SLEEPER IT WAS FRALE HIS SOFT FELT HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE CURL OF DARK HAIR FALLING UPON HIS FOREHEAD FOR AN INSTANT AS HE GAZED ON THE SLEEPING FIGURE
UNTIL THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE THERE LAY THE NEW SILK HAT AS HE HAD TOSSED IT ONE SIDE HE TOOK IT UP AND TURNED IT ABOUT IN HIS HAND YOU SEE DAVID AN OLD HAT IS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND
YES YES OF HER SHE'S NOT SO LITTLE NOW DOCTOR SHE'S TALL TALL ENOUGH TO BE BEAUTIFUL I REMEMBER HER SLIGHT SLIGHT LITTLE CREATURE
YOUR PAW HE LIKE TO A DIED TOO THAT TIME AN WHEN HE MARRIED MARTHY MERLIN I RECKONED HE WAR CURED O HIS WAYS BUT HIT DID'N LAST LONG MARTHY SHE DONE WELL BY HIM AN SHE DONE WELL BY YOU TOO
AND SHOOK HANDS WITH ANOTHER OLD GENTLEMAN
HE WONDERED I SUPPOSE THAT I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT WHEN HE GAVE IT TO ME BUT I FELT CONSCIENCE STRICKEN I'VE BEEN SO FILLED WITH MY LIFE DOWN THERE THE PEACE
WE'LL LET IN A LITTLE MORE LIGHT A VANDYKE AND WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD CASSANDRA WATCHED HIM CROSS THE FLOOR HIS SHORT BOW LEGS REFLECTED GROTESQUELY IN ITS SHINING SURFACE AS HE WALKED
SHE LEANED DOWN TO HIM AND HELD HIM BY THE COAT AN INSTANT SON LEAVE WHISKEY ALONE HIT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU KIN DO TO GET HER YAS AUNT SALLY HE MURMURED HIS EYES THANKED HER WITH ONE LOOK FOR THE TONE
AND LACE CURTAINS THAT OBSCURED THE ONE HIGH NARROW WINDOW OF HER ROOM SHE HAD TRIED TO PUT THEM ONE SIDE THAT SHE MIGHT LOOK OUT WHEN SHE AWOKE BUT SHE COULD SEE ONLY CHIMNEY POTS AND GRIMY IRREGULARLY TILED ROOFS
THEN BETWEEN HIM AND THE BLAZING LIGHT CAME A DARK FIGURE SILHOUETTED BLACKLY AGAINST IT MOVING STOOPING RISING GOING AND COMING A SWEET GIRL'S HEAD WITH HEAVILY COILED HAIR THROUGH WHICH THE FIRELIGHT PLAYED WITH FLASHES OF ITS OWN COLOR
IT IS TRULY WELL WITH MAN ONLY WHEN HE IS ALSO INTELLECTUALLY FREE FOR MAN IS MIND THEREFORE
IS NOT A HUMAN BEING SO FAR AS YOU ARE A JEW ET CETERA YOU ARE NOT A HUMAN BEING AGAIN THE IMPERIOUS POSTULATE CAST FROM YOU EVERYTHING PECULIAR CRITICISE IT AWAY BE NOT A JEW
NOT AS MEN AND IS THEREFORE CALLED EGOISTIC TO THE SOCIALISTS WELFARE IS STILL THE SUPREME AIM AS FREE RIVALRY WAS THE APPROVED THING TO THE POLITICAL LIBERALS
WHO AM EQUALLY WITH GOD THE NOTHING OF ALL OTHERS WHO AM MY ALL
THE FORMER DOES NOT TRY TO GET HOLD OF THINGS
THE THOUGHTS HAD BECOME CORPOREAL ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT WERE GHOSTS SUCH AS GOD EMPEROR POPE FATHERLAND ET CETERA IF I DESTROY THEIR CORPOREITY
IT MUST LEAVE THE GAINED LEISURE TO EGOISTIC PREFERENCE AGAIN AND THE VERY GAIN THAT YOUR SOCIETY FURTHERS FALLS TO THE EGOIST AS THE GAIN OF THE COMMONALTY
BUT OF THE THOUGHTS THAT LIE HIDDEN IN THINGS
AND HAS ONLY HIMSELF BEFORE HIS EYES WOE TO ALL THAT IS NOT WELL PLEASING TO HIM HE SERVES NO HIGHER PERSON AND SATISFIES ONLY HIMSELF HIS CAUSE IS A PURELY
GOD EXISTS ONLY AS MY GOD HE IS AN OPINION OR MY FAITH AND CONSEQUENTLY MY FAITH MY RELIGION MY THOUGHTS
HOLY SPIRIT MAN MANKIND IN SHORT ALL IDEALS THE MAN FINDS HIMSELF AS EMBODIED SPIRIT
WHAT DOES YOUR DEMAND CONCERN HIM WHAT THE CALL TO BE A MAN WHICH YOU ADDRESS TO HIM AS A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE IN THE HUMAN SOCIETY WHICH THE HUMANE LIBERAL PROMISES
SOMETHING OF MY OWN SO EVERY OPINION MUST BE ABOLISHED OR MADE IMPERSONAL THE PERSON IS ENTITLED TO NO OPINION BUT AS SELF WILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE PROPERTY TO SOCIETY
AND UNSOCIAL PRINCIPLES TO THIS THE HUMANE LIBERAL RETORTS THE UNSETTLEDNESS OF MANY IS ONLY YOUR PRODUCT PHILISTINE BUT THAT YOU PROLETARIAN DEMAND THE GRIND OF ALL
WHO HAVE BEEN JUDGES HITHERTO MAY REMAIN SO HOWEVER THOROUGHLY ONE HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THEY BEHAVED AS EGOISTS ONLY THEY MUST NOT ANY LONGER
BUT TO TAKE PART IN THE RIVALRY YOU NEED ONLY TO BE COMMONERS TO TAKE PART IN THE WELFARE ONLY TO BE LABORERS NEITHER REACHES THE POINT OF BEING SYNONYMOUS WITH MAN
SELF OWNERSHIP IS COMBATED ON PRINCIPLE AND SUCH SUBORDINATE ENDS AS THE SOCIAL WELFARE OF THE SOCIALISTS ET CETERA VANISH BEFORE THE LOFTY IDEA OF HUMANITY
WE ARE NOT TO BE PERSUADED TO ANYTHING BY CONVICTION
LOSE MYSELF AGAIN AT ONCE BOWING BEFORE THE COMPLETE SPIRIT AS ONE NOT MY OWN BUT SUPERNAL AND FEELING MY EMPTINESS SPIRIT IS THE ESSENTIAL POINT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE SURE
THE SULTAN HAS SET HIS CAUSE ON NOTHING BUT HIMSELF HE IS TO HIMSELF ALL IN ALL HE IS TO HIMSELF THE ONLY ONE AND TOLERATES NOBODY WHO WOULD DARE NOT TO BE ONE OF HIS PEOPLE
YOU HAVE ONLY AN EGOISTIC END AFTER ALL YOUR WELFARE IS THE HUMANE LIBERAL'S REPROACH TO THE SOCIALIST TAKE UP A PURELY HUMAN INTEREST THEN I WILL BE YOUR COMPANION
UNEXECUTED IDEAS OR THOUGHTS
LOOKED ON LUTHER'S APPEARANCE TOO AS A MERE WRANGLING OF MONKS AT FIRST HUMANISM CORRESPONDS TO SOPHISTICISM AND AS IN THE TIME OF THE SOPHISTS GREEK LIFE STOOD IN ITS FULLEST BLOOM THE PERICLEAN AGE
ALL POWERS THAT ARE ALIEN TO HIM THE MIND ALL SUPERHUMAN HEAVENLY UNHUMAN POWERS MUST BE OVERTHROWN AND THE NAME MAN MUST BE ABOVE EVERY NAME
INSTEAD OF BEING MASTERED EITHER BY SENSUALITY OR BY ANYTHING ELSE GOD MAN AUTHORITY LAW STATE CHURCH ET CETERA WHAT IS OF USE TO ME THIS SELF OWNED OR SELF APPERTAINING ONE MY SELFISHNESS PURSUES
AN EFFORT TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD AND ABOVE IT AND WHAT IS THE WISDOM OF THE MANY FOLLOWING CENTURIES WHAT DID THE MODERNS TRY TO GET BACK OF NO LONGER TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD
GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED THEM THEIR MAJORITY THEY MIGHT HAVE WAITED LONG A SENSIBLE FATHER THROWS OUT A SON WHO WILL NOT COME OF AGE AND KEEPS THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF IT SERVES THE NOODLE RIGHT THE MAN WHO IS SET FREE IS NOTHING BUT A FREEDMAN
BUT BOTH REMAIN ENEMIES AND ALWAYS LIE IN WAIT THEY WATCH FOR EACH OTHER'S WEAKNESSES CHILDREN FOR THOSE OF THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS
IMPERISHABLE LABOR THE HUMANE CONSCIOUSNESS DESPISES THE COMMONER CONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL AS THE LABORER CONSCIOUSNESS FOR THE COMMONER IS INDIGNANT ONLY AT VAGABONDS
ACQUIESCES IN NOTHING ANALYZES EVERYTHING CRITICISES ANEW EVERY RESULT THAT HAS BEEN GAINED THIS RESTLESS MIND IS THE TRUE LABORER IT OBLITERATES PREJUDICES SHATTERS LIMITS AND NARROWNESSES
IN THE SECOND PLACE AS A JEW ONE ASSUREDLY CANNOT BE A MAN IF BEING A MAN MEANS BEING NOTHING SPECIAL BUT IN THE THIRD PLACE AND THIS IS THE POINT I CAN AS A JEW
MY PRINCE MY FATHERLAND FINALLY EVEN THE CAUSE OF MIND AND A THOUSAND OTHER CAUSES ONLY MY CAUSE IS NEVER TO BE MY CONCERN
FOR DEAR LIFE'S SAKE NOT FOR THE GLORIFICATION OF HUMANITY CONSEQUENTLY FREE ACTIVITY IS NOT ATTAINED TILL YOU MAKE YOURSELF FREE FROM ALL STUPIDITIES FROM EVERYTHING NON HUMAN
HE WHO HAS NOT DONE IT HAS SIMPLY LET VIOLENCE BE DONE TO HIM HE WAS A WEAKLING FROM CONSCIENCE I KNOW THAT MY FREEDOM IS DIMINISHED EVEN BY MY NOT BEING ABLE TO CARRY OUT MY WILL ON ANOTHER OBJECT
SO OPINION TOO MUST BE TRANSFERRED TO SOMETHING GENERAL MAN AND THEREBY BECOME A GENERAL HUMAN OPINION IF OPINION PERSISTS THEN I HAVE MY GOD WHY
MAN MAN IS TO MAN THE SUPREME BEING SAYS FEUERBACH MAN HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED
AND THE LIKE CRIES CONSCIENCE TO US AND FRIGHTENS US AWAY FROM IT NOT THE MIGHT OF THE AVENGING EUMENIDES NOT POSEIDON'S WRATH NOT GOD FAR AS HE SEES THE HIDDEN
BY DEGREES WE GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS MYSTERIOUS AND UNCANNY TO US THE MYSTERIOUSLY DREADED MIGHT OF THE ROD THE FATHER'S STERN LOOK ET CETERA AND BACK OF ALL WE FIND OUR ATARAXY E
EGOISM HAS AN IMMENSE FIELD FOR FREE UTILIZATION THE LABORER WILL UTILIZE SOCIETY FOR HIS EGOISTIC ENDS AS THE COMMONER DOES THE STATE
BUT HOW ABOUT THAT DOING THE GOOD FOR THE GOOD'S SAKE WITHOUT PROSPECT OF REWARD AS IF HERE TOO THE PAY WAS NOT CONTAINED IN THE SATISFACTION THAT IT IS TO AFFORD EVEN RELIGION THEREFORE
E G THE CUSTOMS OF STUDENTS CLUBS AND OTHER FORMALITIES IT IS BECAUSE AND WHEN
SHOULD KNOW THE HUMAN OBJECT OF HIS LABOR AND AS HE CAN HAVE THIS CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY WHEN HE KNOWS HIMSELF AS MAN THE CRUCIAL CONDITION IS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
RELIGIOUS DISINTERESTEDNESS A HEAVENLY INTERESTEDNESS CERTAINLY BENEFIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEAVES YOU COLD AND ABSTRACTLY YOU COULD CRY
IN HIM THE VIEW THAT ONE MUST DEAL WITH THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HIS INTEREST NOT ACCORDING TO HIS IDEALS BECOMES CONFIRMED SO LONG AS ONE KNOWS HIMSELF ONLY AS SPIRIT
TO THE COMMUNIST IN PARTICULAR THE HUMANE LIBERAL SAYS IF SOCIETY PRESCRIBES TO YOU YOUR ACTIVITY THEN THIS IS INDEED FREE
WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THIS A PROCEEDING WHICH THIS TIME DID NOT ANNOY BRENDA MISSUS BARLOW ADMIRED THE LITTLE BOOKS
JULIA WOULD GO TO ROXBURY TO SPEND THE HALF DAY WITH RUTH AND ON OTHER SATURDAYS RUTH WOULD COME IN TOWN TO STAY WITH JULIA IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHICH WAS THE PLEASANTER THING TO DO AT ROXBURY THERE WERE RUTH'S PONIES TO DRIVE
AS TO MAKE YOU CONTEMPTUOUS OF YOUR SCHOOLMATES I KNOW THAT MOTHER DEAR
AND LOOKED UP IN JULIA'S FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE AND GRATITUDE COME I AM GOING TO PUT YOU DOWN ON THE GROUND FOR A MINUTE TO SEE WHETHER YOU ARE HURT OR ONLY PRETENDING SO SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD SHE STOOD THE LITTLE DOG ON ITS FEET
OH BELLE CRIED EDITH LOOKING SHOCKED NO INDEED I DON'T AND I AM SURE THAT BRENDA DOES NOT CARE HALF AS MUCH AS SHE PRETENDS WHY EDITH AS FOR THAT YOU YOURSELF NEVER GO DOWN TO THE NORTH END TO SEE THEM
BRENDA WAS IN A TREMOR OF EXCITEMENT OH DEAR HOW DREADFUL IF TO MORROW SHOULD BE STORMY I AM SURE IT WILL BE AND WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE SHALL
FOR PUBLISHERS HAVE A WAY OF QUOTING VERY UNFAIRLY IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS
IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WRITER OF VERSE IS ALMOST IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO MAKES A MOLD FOR A PLASTER CAST OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
THE FOOTMAN PLACED IN HER HAND A LITTLE BOX WITH MADAME DU LAUNY'S COMPLIMENTS HE SAID THIS WHEN SHE OPENED
THEN YOU ARE REALLY A PHILOSOPHER EDITH SAID MISS SOUTH SOME PERSONS TAKE ALMOST A LIFETIME TO LEARN THIS SIMPLE LESSON AND INDEED SOME PERSONS NEVER LEARN IT AT ALL
WHICH MOST OF THEM CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTER IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE CURTAINS AT ONE OR TWO WINDOWS HAD BEEN RAISED A LITTLE THE ROOM WAS STILL RATHER DARK AND AS SHE GLANCED ABOUT JULIA COULD SEE THE PICTURES AND FURNITURE RATHER INDISTINCTLY
THAT BARE FLY LEAF SO SEATING HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE WITH A QUILL PEN IN HIS HAND HE WROTE SLOWLY AND EVIDENTLY WITH SOME EFFORT THE NAME OF EACH OF THEM FOLLOWED BY THE WORDS WITH THE REGARDS OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
SHE NEVER ALLUDED TO A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AS MY FRIEND OR MY NEIGHBOR SHE SPOKE ONLY OF THINGS AND FOR THE MOST PART OF THINGS THAT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH NEW ENGLAND HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL WERE EVIDENTLY PROMPTED BY POLITENESS
AND IN ADDITION TO THE CUT FLOWERS THAT WERE TO ARRIVE ON WEDNESDAY A GREAT MANY BEAUTIFUL POTTED PLANTS AND VINES HAD BEEN SENT IN FROM VARIOUS CONSERVATORIES FOR GENERAL DECORATIONS THE ONLY REAL WORK FOR THE BOYS WHO HAD COME TO ASSIST
RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT WITH HER FOR A DAY OR TWO WHILE FINDING THE OWNER O IF ONLY IT HAD NO OWNER WHAT JOY SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GAZED INTO ITS DARK EYES TO KEEP IT FOR MYSELF
IT IS NEVER THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO SETTLE DOWN TO WORK AFTER THE HOLIDAYS AND EVEN JULIA FOR A DAY OR TWO FOUND HERSELF A LITTLE DREAMY WITH HER THOUGHTS CONSTANTLY GOING BACK TO THE MANY PLEASANT THINGS OF THAT CHRISTMAS WEEK
FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY AND NATURAL FOR HER AT THE LAST TO DISPLAY A LITTLE PETTISHNESS IN THE WAY OF A REFUSAL TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BAZAAR IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THE FOUR AT THEIR WEEKLY MEETINGS FOR WORK
TAKING ITS EXERCISE IN FRONT OF THE GREAT MYSTERIOUS HOUSE JULIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF DOGS AND THE LITTLE TREMBLING CREATURE APPEALED STRONGLY TO HER FOR A MOMENT SHE ALMOST WISHED THAT THERE WERE NO NAME ON THE COLLAR
WERE WERE THEY SOME OF YOUR OWN POEMS SHE MANAGED TO STAMMER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL IF THEY HAD BEEN LOST NOT HALF AS DREADFUL HE REPLIED SMILING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY SOME ONE ELSE
INTERPOSED BRENDA ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE ARE ANY GRANDCHILDREN ENQUIRED MISSUS BARLOW
BELLE HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR WHATEVER KIND OF HATS SHE LIKES OH EDITH RESPONDED NORA YOU ARE ALTOGETHER TOO FAIR I AM TIRED OF HAVING BELLE FIND FAULT WITH EVERY ONE ELSE AS IF SHE WERE JUST PERFECT HERSELF FOR MY OWN PART I
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ENQUIRED THE PRACTICAL NORA WE CAN'T MAKE MUCH OUT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SELL
ANOTHER GUST AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COMPOSE A NEW POEM TO TAKE THE PLACE
AN EVENING'S FUN MISSUS BLAIR HAD SAID THAT ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR MUST BE COMPLETED ON TUESDAY
AT LEAST I SHOULD JUDGE NOT BY THE NUMBERS OF COPIES OF VERSES THAT ARE SENT TO ME TO EXAMINE POETRY DEALS WITH COMMON HUMAN EMOTION
RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE CASES RATHER EXCEPTIONAL TO BE SURE IN WHICH NORA WAS DECIDEDLY IN THE WRONG BELLE THEREFORE COULD AFFORD TO BE MAGNANIMOUS
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
ITS WALLS PANELED WITH MIRRORS WOULD REFLECT THE TABLES OF FANCY WORK IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE IT SEEM
ANSWERED BRENDA MISTER BARLOW LAUGHED I AM AFRAID THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT A VERY STRONG CASE OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHILDREN OH WELL INTERPOSED MISSUS BARLOW
THEN I HOPE HE MAY GET IT MURMURED WILL HARDON TO RUTH ROBERTS I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT WOULD AMUSE THE FELLOWS MORE
IT WAS A BRIGHT CLEAR DAY AND SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD SOME OTHER GIRL TO WALK WITH HER FOR WHEN BY HERSELF SHE NEVER VENTURED BEYOND THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK ALTHOUGH IF HER COUSIN OR ONE OF HER SCHOOL FRIENDS COULD GO WITH HER
TO COLLECT FLOWERS AND PLANTS FOR THE FLOWER TABLE AND ARMED WITH NOTES OF INTRODUCTION FROM MISSUS BARLOW SHE HAD GONE TO MANY A SUPPOSEDLY CLOSE PERSON TO ASK FOR SOME SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLOWER TABLE HER SUCCESS HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER REMARKABLE
MIGHT WRITE HIS NAME ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND HAVE IT PINNED TO THE OBJECT WITH THE LIMIT OF PRICE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO PAY THEN YOU MUST BE WILLING SAID BRENDA
AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE A NEW FRIEND AND IN A VERY UNEXPECTED WAY THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH SHE RODE HOME THOUGH OLD FASHIONED IN SHAPE WAS DELIGHTFULLY COMFORTABLE AND WHEN SHE DESCENDED FROM IT AT HER UNCLE'S DOOR STILL ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED HER
AND THOUGH SHE HAD TRIED NOT EVEN TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT SHE FELT SLIGHTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN HUMAN NOT TO FEEL THAT HER COUSIN HAD SLIGHTED HER IN NOT ASKING HER TO THE CLUB TO LOOK UP AND NOT DOWN TO LOOK OUT AND NOT IN
SHE'S INVITED TO MY COOKING PARTY NEXT WEEK SAID NORA YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED TOO SO YOU'LL SEE HER OH YES BY THE WAY SAID PHILIP WHAT EVENING IS IT FRIDAY OF COURSE REPLIED NORA
HOLDING UP A LARGE DOLL DRESSED IN THE LONG EMBROIDERED ROBES OF A BABY ALL THE GIRLS LAUGHED EXCEPT EDITH WHO SELDOM SAW THE FUNNY SIDE OF THINGS AS QUICKLY AS THE OTHERS WELL YOU CAN SEE YOURSELVES BOYS SHE SAID IN A DETERMINED TONE
AS A MATTER OF FACT BELLE WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED AND SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE HAD STAYED MUCH LONGER WITH HER FRIENDS
AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
MISSUS BLAIR SENT THIS PAPER UP FROM THE LIBRARY TO CHEER YOU THERE WAS A LARGE PATCH OF BLUE IN THE WEST WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN
SHE COULD NOT INDULGE HERSELF HALF AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED ON THIS PARTICULAR AFTERNOON JULIA FELT ESPECIALLY LONELY DOUBTLESS NO SMALL PART OF HER LONELINESS CAME FROM THE FACT THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE FOUR IN THE HOUSE
HASTILY INTERPOSED BELLE BOYS NEVER LIKE A GIRL WHO STUDIES ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS GOING TO COLLEGE WELL JULIA IS JUST THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW SAID NORA REPEATING THE WORDS SHE HAD USED TO PHILIP
THEY WILL MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO SPEND ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MORROW
THESE MACHINES WERE PLACED ONE OR TWO STORIES HIGHER THAN THE WATER TO COMPLETE ALL THERE WAS NEED TO CLEAR THE CHOKED CANALS YEARLY REPAIR THE DAMS AND BUILD LOFTY ROADS FOR THE ARMY WHICH HAD TO MARCH AT ALL SEASONS
WE SHALL NEVER LACK ARTICLES OF THAT SORT BUT WITH MODERATION IN EVERY CASE I DO NOT WISH IT TO GO TO HIS HOLINESS THAT I TORTURE MEN WITHOUT NEED FOR REBELLIOUS CONVERSATION WE MUST BEAT AND TAKE FINES IN MONEY
AND FROM THE SUMMITS OF PYLONS BANNERS WERE HUNG OUT WHOSO WAS IN A FIELD IN A YARD ON THE STREET
WELL SWEEPS AND BUCKETS MOVED WITH DOUBLE ENERGY IRRIGATING THE EARTH WITH DIRTY WATER TO FIT IT FOR NEW SEED MEN HAD BEGUN TO GATHER GRAPES AND FIGS THE NILE HAD FALLEN WATER IN CANALS WAS LOW
THE SUPREME COUNCIL BEGS THEE SUBMISSIVELY HOLINESS TO APPOINT A HIGH PRIEST TO TAKE THY PLACE IN RELIGIOUS FUNCTIONS
I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK MY HEART DIVINES THAT THOU MOTHER HAST SOME PLANS REGARDING ME WHAT ARE THEY SHE STROKED HIS FACE NOT NOW NOT YET THOU ART FREE TO DAY LIKE EVERY YOUNG NOBLE IN THE COUNTRY
THEN MAKE USE OF THY FREEDOM BUT RAMESES THE TIME IS COMING WHEN THOU WILT HAVE TO TAKE A WIFE WHOSE CHILDREN WILL BE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL AND WHOSE SON WILL BE THY HEIR I AM THINKING OF THAT TIME AND WHAT NOTHING DEFINED YET
WE HAVE THE HISTORY OF WRITING FROM ITS EARLIEST BEGINNINGS TO THE POINT AT WHICH WE CONNECT IT WITH THE SYSTEM USED NOW BY ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS EXCEPTING THE CHINESE IN THOSE MONUMENTS ARE PRESERVED THE HISTORY OF RELIGION IN EGYPT
WHOSE TEMPLES AND PALACES WERE VISIBLE THROUGH THE HAZE OF DUST AS THROUGH A VEIL OF MUSLIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD GREW MORE ACTIVE ALONG THE BROAD HIGHWAY AND THE CANALS MEN WERE TAKING TO MARKET CATTLE
NOT LONG BEFORE THIS INCIDENT THE PRINCE MENTIONED DANCERS A SECOND TIME THEN SARAH BURST OUT ANGRILY HOW DID HE PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE NAKED SHAMELESS WOMEN AND JEHOVAH LOOKING DOWN FROM HIGH HEAVEN
INTO THE MOST FRUITFUL LAND OF ANTIQUITY THEY HAD ALSO THAT GENIUS WHICH IMPELS MAN TO LOOK OUT OVER THE HORIZON AROUND HIM SEE MORE THAN THE MATERIAL PROBLEMS OF LIFE AND GAZE INTO THE BEYOND GAZE INTENTLY AND NEVER CEASE GAZING
O ISIS WHO GIVEST BIRTH TO SERPENTS CROCODILES AND OSTRICHES MAY THY NAME BE THRICE PRAISED O ISIS WHO PRESERVEST GRAINS OF WHEAT FROM ROBBER WHIRLWINDS AND THE BODIES OF OUR FATHERS FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE TOIL OF TIME O ISIS
ABOUT A HUNDRED SOLDIERS WITH PICKAXES AND SHOVELS RUSHED TO THE WORK SOME KNOCKED OUT STONES FROM THE CLIFF OTHERS THREW THEM INTO THE DITCH AND COVERED THEM WITH SAND MEANWHILE FROM THE DEPTH OF THE RAVINE CAME A MAN WITH A PICKAXE SHAPED LIKE A STORK'S NECK
THIS IMPELLED THEM TO MAKE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND TO MEASURE TIME TO PRESERVE WATER FOR THE WHOLE YEAR THEY DUG THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY A NETWORK OF CANALS MANY THOUSAND MILES IN LENGTH
PRINCE HIRAM AN OLD MAN WISE AND TREMENDOUSLY WEALTHY SUMMON HIM ERPATR ASK OF HIM A HUNDRED TALENTS PERHAPS HE WILL BE ABLE TO GRATIFY THEE SINCE RAMESES COULD GET NO EXPLANATIONS FROM THE BANKER
TWENTY COWS AND EIGHTY FOUR SHEEP WERE SENT TO THE SLAUGHTER THESE AT COMMAND OF THE OVERSEER OF OXEN WERE ISSUED TO THE SPARROW HAWK REGIMENT IN THIS MANNER
WHEN FULL OF POWER HE IS SURROUNDED BY PERILS AS A WHALE IS SURROUNDED BY ABYSSES OF WATER THEREFORE O LORD MY CREATOR TO THEE THE TORTURED HUMAN SOUL TURNS ITSELF THOU HAST BROUGHT IT INTO A WORLD FULL OF AMBUSHES
AND STRUGGLES OUT OF UNCERTAINTY SARAH WAS SILENT THE PRINCE FELL INTO MEDITATION AND THEN SAID YE JEWS ARE A GLOOMY NATION IF MEN IN EGYPT BELIEVED AS THY SONG TEACHES
WAS LOWERED WITHOUT GIVING THE BLOW
AND THE ALL COMMANDING LORD OF THIS WORLD WAS REALLY JUST SUCH A PERSON AS OTHERS ONLY A LITTLE MORE WEAKLY THAN ORDINARY OLD MEN AND VERY MUCH LIMITED IN POWER BY THE PRIESTLY ORDER THE PRINCE SAW ALL THIS AND JEERED IN HIS SOUL
I KNOW THAT THOU HAST LEARNED TO DANCE AND SING TAKE OFF THOSE LONG ROBES THEREFORE WHICH BECOME PRIESTESSES
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN HEARD THAT ANY MAN EVER ACHIEVED SOMETHING GREAT THROUGH A WOMAN UNLESS HE WAS A LEADER TO WHOM A PHARAOH GAVE HIS DAUGHTER WITH A GREAT DOWRY AND HIGH OFFICE BUT A WOMAN CANNOT HELP A MAN TO REACH A HIGHER PLACE OR EVEN HELP HIM OUT OF TROUBLES
THE OLD EGYPTIANS DESPISED THIS REMNANT OF A CONQUERING RACE EXPELLED FROM POWER AFTERWARD BUT RAMESES LOOKED ON THEM WITH SATISFACTION THEY WERE LARGE AND STRONG THEIR BEARING WAS PROUD AND THERE WAS MANLY ENERGY IN THEIR FACES
WAS THERE TREASON TOO IN THE TEMPLE THOUGHT THE PRINCE SUMMON DAGON IN EVERY CASE SAID HE ALOUD I MUST KNOW THE SOURCE OF THESE LIES AND BY THE GODS I WILL END THEM THOU WILT DO WELL FOR ALL EGYPT IS FRIGHTENED
AND SEIZES WITH HIS EAR THE RUSTLE OF THE CURTAIN LEST TREASON OVERTURN HIM IN HIS OWN TENT FOR THIS REASON MEN'S HEARTS IN ALL PLACES AND AT ALL TIMES ARE OVERFLOWING WITH SADNESS IN THE DESERT THE LION AND THE SCORPION ARE HIS DANGER
WAS A HIGH PRIEST AND POSSESSED EXTENSIVE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PHARAOH AND MY FATHER IS A PHARAOH ALSO I CANNOT ENDURE THE RULE OF HERHOR
IN OCTOBER WHEN THE NILE INUNDATES EGYPT THAT LONG SERPENT WOULD BE BLUE LIKE WATER IN FEBRUARY WHEN SPRING VEGETATION TAKES THE PLACE OF THE DECREASING RIVER THE SERPENT WOULD BE GREEN WITH A BLUE LINE ALONG ITS BODY
I HAVE NO MEASURE FOR THY BEAUTY OR WORDS FOR THY ATTRACTIONS THOU ART A MARVEL AMONG WOMEN WOMEN'S LIPS ARE RICH IN TROUBLE AND THEIR LOVE IS VERY COSTLY BUT WITH ALL THY PERFECTION HOW CANST THOU EASE MY TROUBLES
THE PRINCE GREW SO GLOOMY THAT TUTMOSIS BROKE OFF THE CONVERSATION AND TOOK FAREWELL OF HIS FRIEND AT THE EARLIEST WHEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS BOAT WHICH WAS FURNISHED WITH A BALDACHIN AND CURTAINS HE DREW A DEEP BREATH
OPPOSITION APPEARED SO CLEARLY DEFINED AND INCURABLE THAT THE RUIN OF BOTH SIDES WAS EVIDENT IN THE FUTURE THE RUIN OF A PHARAOH AND THE FALL OF HIS DYNASTY WITH THE RISE OF A SELF CHOSEN SOVEREIGN AND A NEW LINE OF RULERS
AND WITH HIM HIS ASSISTANTS THEY BROUGHT FROM TEN TO TWENTY ROLLS OF PAPYRUS WRITTEN ON BOTH SIDES WHEN UNWOUND THEY FORMED A STRIP THREE SPANS OF A GREAT HAND IN WIDTH AND IN LENGTH SIXTY PACES
THAT THEY EXPLAIN NOTHING BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES COMPREHEND NOTHING THE NOMARCHS AND THEIR SCRIBES CONTINUED THE PRIEST ARE LIKE DECURIONS IN AN ARMY EACH ONE KNOWS HIS TEN MEN AND REPORTS ON THEM EACH COMMANDS THOSE UNDER HIM
THAT ATTACK ON THE VILLA THEN BECAUSE RAMESES TOOK HER PART AND WISHED TO RUSH ON THE RIOTERS SHE WAS STILL MORE TERRIFIED SHE LOST PRESENCE OF MIND AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS IN THE HANDS OF A MAN OF SUCH POWER
WHILE THESE THREE ELEMENTS WORKED UNITEDLY TOWARD THE OBJECTS INDICATED BY NATURE SOCIETY HAD STRENGTH TO FLOURISH AND COMPLETE IMMORTAL LABORS THE MILD GLADSOME AND BY NO MEANS WARLIKE EGYPTIANS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
THE VICEROY LEARNED DAY AFTER DAY HOW MUCH WHEAT BARLEY BEANS AND LOTUS SEED WERE WEIGHED INTO THE GRANARIES HOW MUCH GIVEN OUT TO THE MILLS HOW MUCH STOLEN AND HOW MANY LABORERS WERE CONDEMNED TO THE QUARRIES FOR STEALING
FROM THE TIME THAT THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO MENTION HIS NAME AND SPEAK OF CERTAIN PLANS OF HIS CHANGES IN THE STATE FUTURE WARS THINKING OF THIS THE PRINCE FELT AS IF A NAMELESS CROWD OF REBELS AND UNFORTUNATES WERE PUSHING HIM VIOLENTLY TO THE POINT OF THE HIGHEST OBELISK
FOR THEY HAVE NOTHING TO PAY WITH SOME TIME I WILL REWARD THEM NOW CONTINUED TUTMOSIS WE TAKE FROM THY TREASURY FOR WANT IS OPPRESSING US THE NOMARCHS DO THE SAME
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE PHOENICIANS IN OUR STATE ARE LIKE RATS IN A GRANARY WHEN ONE PUSHES IN THROUGH A CREVICE OTHERS FOLLOW RAMESES LOITERED IN LEAVE TAKING HAST THOU SOMETHING MORE TO TELL ME INQUIRED THE QUEEN
SPECTACLES HUNTING AND FEASTS AGAIN BUT JUST WHEN RANUZER FELT CERTAIN THAT THE VICEROY WAS TIRED OF QUESTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION AND ECONOMY THE LATTER SUMMONED HIM AND ASKED
APRIL AND MAY THE SUN STOOD HIGH HERALDING THE MOST VIOLENT SEASON OF HEAT FOR EGYPT A MIGHTY WIND FROM THE DESERT HAD BLOWN IN REPEATEDLY MEN AND BEASTS FELL BECAUSE OF HEAT AND ON FIELDS AND TREES
HOW IS THAT THEN IF I DO NOT BECOME A PRIEST WILL YE NOT EXPLAIN TO ME THERE ARE THINGS WORTHINESS WHICH THOU MAYEST KNOW EVEN NOW
IN THE ARMY HOLY FATHER CONTINUED RAMESES
AND THEY DIRECT HEARTS AS THE WIND DIRECTS TREE LEAVES WITHOUT THEM
AND THERE ROLL UPON THE GRASS IN CONVULSIONS OF LAUGHTER
A SLIP OF PAPER WAS PRESSED INTO HER HAND
I FOUND HIM LOOKING FOR YOU HE IS TRUE AS STEEL IN IN AND OFF OR YOU ARE LOST WHISPERED YVONNE FLINGING A CLOAK ABOUT GASTON THRUSTING A PURSE A SWORD AND A FLASK INTO HIS HAND AND HOLDING THE BOAT WHILE HE LEAPED IN
ABNER AND I WILL BE ALONG AND IF YOU GET INTO A SCRAPE JEST GIVE A YELL AND WE'LL COME NO FEAR OF THAT I'VE TRAMPED ROUND ALL SUMMER AND KNOW MY WAY LIKE AN INDIAN KEEP THE GIRLS QUIET AND LET ME HAVE A GOOD LARK I'LL TURN UP ALL RIGHT BY SUNDOWN
BUT IT'S NOT MY FUNERAL SO I WON'T MEDDLE HOPE YOU'LL HAVE FIRST RATE SPORT AND BAG A BRACE OF CATS ONE THING YOU MIND DON'T GET TOO NIGH BEFORE YOU FIRE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CRITTERS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CHRIS SPOKE IN A DEEP WHISPER
A PRETTY HARD PROSPECT EITHER WAY THE SIGHT OF AN EAGLE SOARING ABOVE HIM SEEMED TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION AND FILL HIM WITH NEW STRENGTH AND ARDOR TO SHOOT THE KING OF BIRDS AND TAKE HIM HOME IN TRIUMPH WOULD COVER THE HUNTER WITH GLORY
AND HIS FATHER TAUGHT HIM HORSEMANSHIP AND THE USE OF ARMS ACCOMPLISHMENTS CONSIDERED ALL IMPORTANT IN THOSE DAYS
WHERE THEY GAVE HER FIRE FOOD DRY GARMENTS AND THE GLADDEST WELCOME ONE HUMAN CREATURE EVER GAVE TO ANOTHER BEING A ROBUST PEASANT THE GIRL CAME SAFELY THROUGH HARDSHIPS THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED OR CRAZED A FRAILER CREATURE
FOR THE OLD COUNT HAD BEEN AN OFFICER OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD AND HASTENED TO PROVE HIS LOYALTY YVONNE'S HEART BEAT HIGH WITH PRIDE AS SHE SAW HER FOSTER BROTHER RIDE GALLANTLY AWAY BESIDE HIS FATHER
SHE UNDERSTOOD
ON THE FIRST FALLEN LOG THEY CAME TO AND MAKE HIS ESCAPE BUT MISSUS BARKER GOT ON BRAVELY WITH THE SUPPORT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND CHATTED AWAY SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT CORNY WOULD REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THE WALK IF HIS SOUL HAD NOT BEEN YEARNING FOR CATAMOUNTS
AND THERE IS NO REST FOR ME TILL I KNOW HOW HE FARES SAID YVONNE
WHERE MISTLETOE CLUNG TO THE GREAT OAKS AND MENHIRS AND DOLMENS
AS HE FOLLOWED THE LITTLE STREAM THAT WENT TUMBLING OVER THE STONES THAT INCREASED AS THE GROUND SLOPED TOWARD THE DEEP RAVINE WHERE A WATERFALL SHONE LIKE SILVER IN THE SUN I'LL TAKE A BATH IF THE POOL IS BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WILL SET ME UP
WHICH HAD SERVED MANY A FUGITIVE FOR A SHELTER AS THEY WENT
LET HIM LAUGH IT WILL BE MY TURN WHEN I GO HOME WITH A FINE CAT OVER MY SHOULDER THOUGHT CORNY TEARING ALONG HEEDLESS OF FALLS SCRATCHES AND BRUISED KNEES AT LENGTH HE PAUSED FOR BREATH AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM WELL SATISFIED
A WOFUL SPECTACLE WAS THE TRIM LAD AS HE EMERGED FROM THE SLOUGH BLACK AND DRIPPING IN FRONT WELL SPATTERED BEHIND HATLESS AND ONE SHOE GONE HAVING BEEN CARELESSLY LEFT UNLACED IN THE ARDOR OF THE CHASE
THE WIFE AND MOTHER WAS DEAD BUT AN OLD SERVANT TOOK CARE OF THEM AND DID HER BEST TO MAKE REUBEN AND EUNICE GOOD CHILDREN HER DIREST THREAT WHEN THEY WERE NAUGHTY WAS THE INDIANS WILL COME AND FETCH YOU IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE
I SHALL DO MY DUTY AND LEAVE THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE LORD ANSWERED THE PARSON WITH SUCH PIOUS FIRMNESS THAT THE NEIGHBORS SAID NO MORE BUT THEY KEPT A CLOSE WATCH UPON ONAWANDAH WHEN HE WENT AMONG THEM SILENT AND SUBMISSIVE
HAD SECRETLY DONE ITS WORK AND SEVERAL BARS WERE LOOSE HE KNEW THAT THE ATTEMPT MIGHT COST HIM HIS LIFE BUT WAS WILLING TO GAIN LIBERTY EVEN AT THAT PRICE FOR IMPRISONMENT SEEMED WORSE THAN DEATH TO HIS IMPATIENT SPIRIT
OR KNOCK OVER SOME HANDY BEAST FOR SUPPER HE SAID TALKING TO HIMSELF FOR COMPANY EVEN THE OLD CHAP LOST IN THE BUSH IN AUSTRALIA HAD A SAVAGE WITH HIM WHO DUG A HOLE IN A TREE AND PULLED OUT A NICE FAT WORM TO EAT
WAITING FOR A GOOD CHANCE TO PLUNGE HE WANTED TO BE OFF BEFORE ABNER CAME AS HE WELL KNEW THAT WISE MAN AND MIGHTY HUNTER WOULD NEVER LET HIM GO ALONE THE VERY NEXT PATH I SEE I'LL DIVE IN AND RUN
WHO WAS BOTH HER PRINCE AND BROTHER HER INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS GREAT FOR SHE WAS OF A CALM AND PATIENT NATURE AS WELL AS
THE PRETTY WINGED CREATURE FRIGHTENED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS HOME HAD FLOWN TO HER FOR REFUGE AND SHE HAD CHERISHED IT FOR ITS MASTER'S SAKE NOW WHEN IT WOULD NOT LEAVE HER BUT CAME CIRCLING AROUND HER HEAD A LEAGUE AWAY FROM DINAN
AS SHE PASSED ONE OF THE MEN WHO GUARDED THEM A ROUGH FELLOW WHOSE FACE WAS HALF HIDDEN BY A SHAGGY BEARD YOU WILL BE DROWNED WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE ON WOMEN
I HOPE YOU MAYN'T FIND YOU'VE WARMED A VIPER IN YOUR BOSOM MASTER TWO DAYS LATER IT SEEMED AS IF BECKY WAS A TRUE PROPHET AND THAT THE CONFIDING MINISTER HAD BEEN TERRIBLY DECEIVED FOR ONAWANDAH WENT AWAY TO HUNT
WHO CARES FOR HUNGER AND MOSQUITO BITES NOT I HUNTERS CAN BEAR MORE THAN THAT I GUESS THE NEXT LIVE THING I SEE I'LL SHOOT IT AND MAKE A FIRE AND HAVE A JOLLY SUPPER NOW WHICH WAY WILL I GO UP OR DOWN
WILL YOU TALK OR SHALL I SING WHILE YOU REST THIS HOT HEAD AND DREAM OF HORSE AND HOUND AND SPEARING THE WILD BOAR ADDED YVONNE
SOMEWHERE ROUND THAT WAY I CAN TRY FOR IT AND PERHAPS SHOOT SOMETHING ON THE WAY MAY BREAK MY BONES BUT I CAN'T SIT AND STARVE UP HERE AND I WAS A FOOL TO COME I'LL KEEP THE FEATHER ANYWAY TO PROVE THAT I REALLY SAW AN EAGLE THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING
WHEN IT RESTED ON A BLUE GOWNED WHITE CAPPED FIGURE SPRINKLING WEBS OF LINEN SPREAD TO BLEACH IN THE GREEN MEADOW BY THE RIVER RANCE IF I MAY NOT HUNT
NO GUIDE BUT THE SUN BY DAY THE STARS BY NIGHT PLUNGED INTO THE PATHLESS FOREST AND WAS GONE THEN THE PEOPLE DREW A LONG BREATH AND MUTTERED TO ONE ANOTHER HE WILL NEVER DO IT YET HE IS A BRAVE LAD FOR HIS YEARS
AND POINTING TO THE FIGURE OF A MAN WITH A PALE FACE AND BANDAGED HEAD LYING ASLEEP BESIDE THE FIRE IT WAS THE COUNT SORELY WOUNDED BUT ALIVE THANKS TO HIS DEVOTED FOLLOWER WHO HAD SAVED HIM WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER
HE HAD HEARD OF THE MASSACRE OF THE ROYALIST EMIGRANTS WHO LANDED THERE AND TRIED TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR A LIKE FATE
AND THAT A HAPPY ONE COMPLETED THEIR JOY AND TURNED THEIR FLIGHT INTO A TRIUMPHANT MARCH PAUSING IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT FOREST OF HUNAUDAYE TO REST
AND NURSED HER MASTER BACK TO HEALTH
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED BY A ROSY BROWN EYED LASS WHOSE WHITE TEETH SHONE AS SHE LAUGHED TO SEE HIM LEAP THE MOAT DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND COME BOUNDING TOWARD HER HIS HAIR STREAMING IN THE WIND
REACHED HOME SAFELY AND DAME GILLIAN CONCEALED HIM IN THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY TILL ANXIETY FOR YVONNE DROVE HIM OUT TO SEEK AND RESCUE IN HIS TURN FOR SHE DID NOT COME AND WHEN A RETURNING SOLDIER
BUT YOU HE CRIED I CANNOT LEAVE YOU IN PERIL AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DARED AND DONE FOR ME NO ONE SUSPECTS ME I AM SAFE GO TO MY MOTHER SHE WILL HIDE YOU AND I WILL FOLLOW SOON
THE ROPE WAS MADE FAST TO AN IRON STAPLE INSIDE
AND WOULD BRING TROUBLE OF SOME SORT WHEN HE IS WELL HE MAY GO WHITHERSOEVER HE WILL BUT WHILE HE IS TOO LAME TO WALK WEAK WITH HUNGER AND WORN OUT WITH WEARINESS I WILL HARBOR HIM HE CANNOT FEIGN SUFFERING AND STARVATION LIKE THIS
WAITING FOR NO FURTHER SPEECH
ONE AUTUMN NIGHT WHEN THE FIRST HEAVY RAINS WERE FALLING AND A COLD WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE VALLEY A KNOCK CAME AT THE MINISTER'S DOOR AND OPENING IT HE FOUND AN INDIAN BOY RAGGED HUNGRY AND FOOT SORE WHO BEGGED FOR FOOD AND SHELTER
SO TIRED AND HUNGRY THAT HE HEARTILY WISHED HIMSELF BACK AMONG THE PARTY WHO HAD LUNCHED WELL AND WERE NOW PROBABLY DRIVING GAYLY HOMEWARD TO A GOOD SUPPER
MISTY AND WHITE BELOW HIM HE LAY A FEW MINUTES DROWSILY MUSING FOR THE FALL HAD STUNNED HIM THEN AS HE MOVED HIS HAND SOMETHING PRICKED IT AND HE FELT PINE NEEDLES IN THE FINGERS THAT CLOSED OVER THEM CAUGHT IN A TREE BY JUPITER
DISCOVERING NOW THE PERILS HE HAD BEEN TOO EAGER TO SEE BEFORE HE WAS A GOOD CLIMBER BUT WAS STIFF WITH WEARINESS AND HIS HANDS ALREADY SORE WITH SCRATCHES AND POISON SO HE WENT SLOWLY FEELING QUITE UNFIT FOR SUCH HARD WORK COMING TO THE RAVINE
AS SHE LISTENED THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE BUT STILL SHE TURNED ON AND ON SOMETIMES HE WAS SO HOPEFUL AND BRIGHT AND AGAIN SO DESPAIRING
HE DIED BEFORE THE MORNING SHE PUT THE MACHINE AWAY AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW THE SUN HAD RISEN THE SKY WAS ON FIRE WITH THE PROMISE OF A BEAUTIFUL DAY
BUT TWO HUNDRED SHARES OF BENNINGHAM COMMON HAD SOLD AT SEVENTEEN A DROP OF TEN POINTS HIS EYE CAUGHT AN EXPLANATORY NOTE THE DIVIDEND ON THE PREFERRED HAD BEEN CUT THE SURPLUS WAS HEAVILY REDUCED HIS MIND SEARCHING RAPIDLY OVER THEIR BUSINESS
IT WAS GOOD TO BE ALIVE HE THOUGHT FREE SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED WITH LEAVE TO TELL A GIRL
HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF WALDRON PACING SOMEWHERE LIKE HIMSELF ALONE LOST HELPLESS HIS PRIDE GONE IN HIS AWAKENED IMAGINATION HE SAW HIM WANDERING NEARER AND NEARER THE FATAL ACT
HE SPOKE THE WORDS WITH SINGULAR FEELING TRULY THOUGH MISTER NOAKES SHE SAID IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER YOU ARE TOO BUSY MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE TO BREAK OUT BREAK OUT WITH THE MEASLES IF NOTHING ELSE WILL INTERRUPT YOU AND YOU ARE TO HAVE TEA WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON
SAY SONNY HE CALLED WHO SELLS LAND IN THIS BURG DUBELL JOHN DUBELL THANKS HE WENT MORE AND MORE SLOWLY A DRUG STORE
AND THEY'RE NO GOOD SELL QUICK WALDRON LOOKED AT HIM IN DOUBT HOW MUCH DO I LOSE HE ASKED FEEBLY BOUT SIX THOUSAND' AGAINST HIS WILL CARGAN MADE THE TONE APOLOGETIC
AVIDLY HE GAVE HIMSELF TO THE SPELL HIS TIGHT STRUNG IMAGINATION HAD CONJURED A FACE OVAL AND DELICATELY TINTED LIPS JOYOUSLY CURVED GRAY EYES NOT LARGE BUT BRIMMING WITH ENTHUSIASM FEARLESSNESS AND TRUTH
AND SAT SMOKING PEACEFULLY HIS MIND AGLOW WITH PLEASANT THOUGHTS THE BELL WHIRRED RAUCOUSLY HE SAW THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO REPLACE THE RECEIVER AND PUTTING IT TO HIS EAR CAUGHT CASEY'S VOICE AGAIN
IT WAS AN AMUSING PLAY AND SHE WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS SHE RANG HIM UP BETWEEN THE ACTS AND FOUND HIM DEPRESSED HURRYING HOME SHE HAD SETTLED DOWN TO TALK TO HIM AT HER EASE HOW IT ALL CAME BACK TO HER NOW ARE YOU THERE MY DEAREST YES BUT OH
TWO HOURS ANYWAY CARGAN FLUNG HIS CIGARETTE ON THE GROUND I'LL MISS MY CONNECTION AT HAY JUNCTION HE PROTESTED I'VE GOTTA BE IN HAMDEN THIS AFTERNOON WALK THEN
TO WAKE TO WHAT TO SUCH AWAKENING AS THERE IS FOR THOSE WHO NEVER FORGET ANYTHING
IT WAS TO MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT HE HAD RALLIED WONDERFULLY AT THE END AND WAS CONFIDENT OF RECOVERY
HE DID NOT ACCORD TO HIMSELF THE GODLIKE PRIVILEGE OF CASTING DISCORD AMONG THE NATIONS AND HE DID NOT CARE WHAT PEACEFUL ZOO THE LION THE BEAR AND THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF EAGLE FOUND AS COMMON REFUGE ON THE OTHER HAND IF TO EACH IS GIVEN COEXTENSIVE POWER
THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GALLING AND THE MADNESS OF GRATIFICATION CONSUMED HIS STRENGTH HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR STEPPING VERY GENTLY FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW SLIGHT A VIBRATION MIGHT SHATTER THE DELICATE AFFINITY IN HIS DISCOVERY
AND MOTIONED NOAKES TO A CHAIR NEAR THEM AH I SEE IT YOU WILL BE A SECOND MAX ALL SCIENCE ALL ABSENCE AND A WOMAN WAITING AT HOME IMMOLATION YOU CALL IT SHE CONTINUED
IN THE MIRROR OF THE SODA FOUNTAIN HE SAW HIMSELF TORN DIRTY SHRINKING AND THE SIGHT FILLED HIM WITH DISGUST AND ANGER HE FELT AS RIDICULOUS AS WHEN HE HAD COME OUT WITH A GLASS TOO MUCH FROM THE STONEHAM BAR AND TRIPPED OVER THE STEPS OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE
I'M SURE GLAD HE REPEATED MORE VIGOROUSLY CARRYIN HIM TO DAY WAS WHAT DID IT A VISION OF MISSUS WALDRON'S HAPPY FACE ROSE TO BLESS HIM THE EXHILARATION OF THE MORNING COURSED BACK INTO HIS HEART
IT WAS A CASE SAID THE ENGINEER OF SUPPLY FOLLOWING DEMAND ALL AMERICANS REQUIRED TIME AND LABOR SAVING APPLIANCES AND THEY OBTAINED THEM WHERE SERVANTS ABOUNDED AND THERE WAS NO SERVANT PROBLEM AS IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT
THE CONNECTION FAILED AND LEFT HIM GASPING WHAT SOLD IT HE TOLD YOU TO NO I DUNNO ANYTHING ABOUT A COURT DECISION UP FIFTEEN POINTS ON A MERGER
AND AT THE WORD HEY THERE CASEY HE YELLED AT THE DIM VOICE ON THE WIRES I'VE GOTTA HAVE FIVE THOUSAND QUICK SELL THAT BENNINGHAM COMMON YES WALDRON'S AT THE NAME HIS ANGER BROKE LOOSE THE OLD HIGH BROW TRIED TO BLUFF ME WHAT
A LOW WAVE OF THE PRAIRIES HAD HIDDEN FROM HIM A LITTLE HOUSE AND BARN STANDING CRUDELY NEW AGAINST THE SKY IN THE DISTANCE TINY FIGURES WERE MOVING BEHIND THE BUILDINGS AND A DUST CLOUD ROSE FROM THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT
WELL IF YOU'LL MAKE IT FIVE PLUNKS AND GIVE ME YOUR TICKET YOU CAN TAKE THIS HORSE AN I'LL GO ROUND BY TRAIN SAY DO YOU WANT TO CARGAN WAS TEMPTED
NO SHADOWY INTERSECTIONS OF THE LINES OF GOOD AND EVIL I SAY I'M BLOWN TO WISPS COULDN'T YOU FIND ME A MIRROR PLEASE WHAT WOULD I DO WITH A MIRROR HERE BUT SEE HE LIFTED THE WINDOW SASH PULLED IN ONE SHUTTER AND WITH A GESTURE OF PRESENTATION SAID
THE SILENCE FLOWED OVER HIM AS A STREAM THAT HAD BEEN HELD BACK THE SKY WAS ENORMOUS HE WAS ONLY A SPECK ON THE VAST FLOOR AS HE PLODDED ON AND ON AND ON THROUGH THE DUST HE BEGAN TO GROW DIZZY FROM THE GLARE AND THE HEAT
WHEN HE SAT DOWN IN THE DINER FOR HIS MORNING MEAL THE GREAT WHEEL OF THE HORIZON RIMMED ROUND HIS LITTLE TRAIN WITHOUT A NOTCH ON THE PERFECT CIRCLE OVER NIGHT THE OUTER WORLD HAD CHANGED BUT HE WAS ABSORBED IN FITTING HIS CHOICES INTO A SIXTY CENT BREAKFAST
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED AFRESH BY THE FORCEFUL EXTERIOR SIGNIFICANT OF THE INNER ATTITUDE WHICH HAD WON FOR HENRY MAXINEFF A NAME HONORED AMONG NATIONS WHAT OF YOUR WORK HE SAID NOAKES WAS GLAD THOSE SEEING EYES WERE NOT ON HIM
HE'LL SHOOT HIMSELF I OUGHT TO DONE SOMETHING HE WHISPERED WITH A SUDDEN RUSH OF UNFAMILIAR EMOTION AND ALL THE SENTIMENT IN HIS NATURE HEAVED AND STRUGGLED TO THE LIGHT A COW LOWED SOMEWHERE BEYOND THEM
WAIT UNTIL I'VE FINISHED AND GRANT ME THAT IT'S WORTH WHILE HE WHISPERED TO THE FACE AND HIS BREATH MADE LITTLE SWIRLS AND EDDIES IN THE HAZE ABOUT IT THE FILMY CURVES WAFTED TOWARD HIM BRINGING IT CLOSE TO HIS LIPS THE LIDS FLUTTERED
THIS WILL BRING IT NEARER MAXINEFF SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY MISSUS MAXINEFF SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS SHE WALKED TOWARD THE LONG WINDOWS STAY TO DINNER WILL YOU SHE SAID TO NOAKES THANKS BUT I COULDN'T WITH PROPRIETY
MISTER CARGAN THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS ABOVE BUSINESS HIS VOICE FAILED A LITTLE THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH CARGAN HAD HEARD THAT BLUFF BEFORE
TELL ME SOME MORE ABOUT YOUR INVENTIVE FRIEND IS HE WEALTHY INDEED NO SAID THE ENGINEER THAT IS HIS TROUBLE IF HE HAD MORE MONEY OR IF HE HAD SOME RICH BACKERS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM HE MIGHT DO WONDERS I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP HIM SHE SAID
ONE OF THE BUILDINGS HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY HOSPITAL HE THOUGHT OF THE PITIFUL OCCUPANT HIS FACE SCARRED ONE SOCKET EYELESS AND SHIVERED IT ISN'T THAT I WANT TO HEDGE HE SAID I SHALL TAKE THE CHANCE
AND CAGLIOSTRO WHEN THE PUZZLE'S SOLVED COME TO SEE ME I'LL SING AWAY THE WORRIES GOOD BYE GOOD BYE MISS BECKY EXCUSE MY UNTRACTABLENESS WON'T YOU WITH A PAT TO HER HAT AND A SMILE TO NOAKES SHE WAS GONE
HER FACE WAS TROUBLED AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE MOTOR SHE CAUGHT HER HUSBAND'S ELBOW GENTLY AS IF TO ASK HIM SOMETHING BUT HE MERELY NODDED AND TURNED HER GLANCE TOWARD CARGAN'S WINDOW SHE BOWED AND SMILED VERY SWEETLY IN HIS DIRECTION
THE TRAIN WAS STARTING INDEED HE HAD JUST TIME TO DASH UP THE STEPS OF HIS CAR GOOD BYE DEAR SHE CAROLED
THE SKY SWAM DIZZILY HE DARED NOT PULL ON THE REINS HE COULD ONLY HOLD ON GRIMLY AND SHUT HIS EYES ONCE HE SLIPPED AND SCREAMING SAW FOR AN INSTANT A BLUR OF GRASS BEFORE HE COULD PULL HIMSELF BACK TO SAFETY
HE WATCHED HER A MOMENT THEN STRODE RAPIDLY TO THE STAND LOOKING THROUGH THE FAINT HAZE HE SAW HER PASS DOWN THE STRAIGHT PATH WHICH LED TO THE GREAT GATE OF THE MAXINEFF WORK YARD WHEN SHE WAS CLOSE TO IT HE GRASPED THE SWITCH LEVER WITH CRAMPED FINGERS
THROUGH IT HE SAW SHOPS STORE HOUSES AND SMALL BUILDINGS SIMILAR TO HIS OWN ALL A PART OF THE PLANT OF MAXINEFF
EACH NEW EXPLOSIVE DEALS A BLOW AT WAR WAR NOAKES HAD HEARD THE SAME THING WHEN HIS CHIEF CONCLUDED WITH THE GOVERNMENT AN AGREEMENT WHICH SECURED TO IT THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS LATEST PRODUCT
HIS HAND LEFT THE LEVER AS IF IT PRICKED HIM YOU AM I A WRAITH NOAKES LOOKED AT HER SILENTLY IN THE MOMENT'S ABSTRACTION HER PRESENCE SEEMED A MANIFESTATION OF SOME PSYCHIC CONDUCTION WHICH HE TRIED LAMELY TO UNDERSTAND
HIS HORSE PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND THE CALF AMBLED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND CARGAN LIMPED AFTER HURRIEDLY LEADING HIS HORSE A HUNDRED YARDS BROUGHT THEM TO THE EDGE OF A SLIGHT BOWL IN THE PLAINS WITH A LITTLE MOISTURE AROUND WHICH PEWEES WERE FLYING
HE PAUSED LOOKING ME FIXEDLY IN THE FACE ALL GENUINE THAT EVENING I HAD A SMALL DINNER PARTY IT WAS RATHER AN OCCASION THE SUGGESTION I AM BOUND TO ADMIT HAD COME FROM MARGARET
WAS STRUGGLING GALLANTLY TO REACH SAFETY ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS THE LAST BALL OF MISTER SAPSWORTH'S OVER MISTER BENYON RAN THIRTEEN FOR A HIT TO LEG HE MADE MISTER BARKER RUN THEM TOO IT WAS THE PROVERBIAL LAST STRAW
YOU MUST KNOW THAT WILLYUM IS THAT NEAR ABOUT MONEY THAT I NEVER SAW NOTHING LIKE HIM NOT THAT IT'S A BAD THING IN A MAN THOUGH IT MAY BE CARRIED TOO FAR AND I MUST SAY I DO THINK WILLYUM DO CARRY IT TOO FAR
I SUPPOSE THAT'S A BOUNDARY HE CALLED TO THE SCORER IF THERE WAS ONE WHICH I DOUBT PUT DOWN TOM BENYON SIX HE TURNED AGAIN TO ME IT'S NO GOOD WASTING TIME LOOKING FOR THAT BALL I'VE ANOTHER IN MY POCKET YOU CAN HAVE
EVEN IN MY BEST DAYS COME UP TO FIRST RATE FORM AND MY BEST DAYS WERE RECKONING FROM LAST SUMMER QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO DURING THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS I DO NOT REMEMBER ONCE HANDLING A BAT
AND DON'T LET NO BAD TEMPERS SPOIL OUR PLEASURE I MAY HAVE SOME MONEY SOMEWHERE UNBEKNOWN TO MYSELF SO I WILL LOOK AND SEE THOUGH I MUST SAY I DO THINK IT HARD THAT ALL THE EXPENSES SHOULD BE BORNE BY ME SO HE BEGINS FEELING IN HIS POCKETS
GIVE YOU WHAT YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL THE GOVERNOR LOOKED AT THE PRISONER THEN AT HIS FRIENDS A TESTIMONIAL MIGHT WE INDEED WHAT SORT OF TESTIMONIAL DO YOU ALLUDE TO
WELL HE SAID IT'S A PITY IT SHOULD BE WASTED I'LL EAT IT MYSELF WHICH HE DID AND ME STANDING IN THE RAIN THERE LOOKING ON THAT DID PUT MY BACK UP MISTER EVANS I SAID SHORT AND SHARP I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY I AM GOING
I DON'T THINK MISTER LUCAS MURMURED MISSUS CHALMERS THAT YOU HAVE THE LEAST IDEA HOW ILL I FEEL MY DEAR MISSUS CHALMERS IF IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU
AFTER SUCH A LAPSE OF TIME ONE REQUIRES TO PULL ONESELF TOGETHER BEFORE EXHIBITING ONE'S POWERS TO A CRICKETER OF MISTER BENYON'S CALIBRE HE HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM TO RECOGNISE THE NECESSITY WHICH I MYSELF FELT THAT I WAS UNDER
AS MISTER BARKER WAS RUNNING THE THIRTEENTH RUN INSTEAD OF GOING TO HIS WICKET HE DROPPED HIS BAT THE BAT WHICH HE HAD NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO UTILISE AND BOLTED OFF THE FIELD AS THOUGH SATAN WAS BEHIND HIM MISTER BENYON CALLED OUT TO HIM
THE MAN WHO TAKES MUCH OF THAT STUFF WILL BE KILLED IF HE ISN'T CURED DEATH FOR ME RATHER THAN AUNT JANE'S JALAP' IF IT IS JALAP IT IS RATHER PUNGENT I OWNED
I SHOULD CONVEY IT TO COLONEL GREGORY INDEED IN THAT CASE HE WOULD HAVE AS HIGH AN OPINION OF OUR CHARACTERS AS OF YOURS AND YOURSELF WHAT SORT OF ACTION MIGHT WE EXPECT FROM YOU
AND A FINE SCUFFLE I HAD TO GET THERE TOO AND IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME HE KEPT ME WAITING TWO HOURS AND THREE QUARTERS BY THE CLOCK WHAT'S OVER THE GATEKEEPER'S LODGE WHICH IS LONGER THAN ANY GENTLEMAN OUGHT TO KEEP A LADY WAITING
AND AS IT SEEMED SILLY FOR ME TO STAND WHILST HE WAS SITTING I SAT DOWN LIKEWISE SO THERE WE SAT NEITHER OF US SAYING NOTHING TILL I BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE DAMP
THE CRITICISM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE GOVERNOR ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS COLLEAGUES WITH WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A GHASTLY GRIN
HE FIRST STOOD CLOSE UP TO THE HEDGE THEN HE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEDGE THEN I DOUBT IF HE STOOD UPON THE OTHER SIDE BUT AT LEAST HE HAD VANISHED FROM MY KEN AND I WAS LEFT ALONE TO BOWL TO MISTER BENYON THAT OVER
WHEN IS THE MATCH TO BE I ASKED TO MORROW WAS THE STARTLING REPLY I WAS SPEECHLESS THAT I AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS TOTAL ABSTENTION
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CEASED THE PRISONER SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERING WHAT ANSWER HE SHOULD MAKE THEN INCLINING HIS HEAD WITH THAT ALMOST SATURNINE GRACE IF ONE MAY COIN A PHRASE
SOMETIMES THERE'S NEVER NO KNOWING WHO THEY ARE I FELT THAT I WAS GETTING ON
MISTER BENYON URGED THE FIELDERS ON HURRY UP BILL HEDGES MISTER HEDGES DID NOT HURRY UP HE NEVER COULD HAVE HURRIED UP EVEN IF HIS MANNER OF FIELDING THE BALL HAD NOT WHOLLY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WIND BUT THE BALL WAS AT LAST THROWN IN
PICKING AT THE BITS OF PASTY WHAT WAS STUCK TO THE PAPER
PYBUS TOLD SOME PLEASANT AND CHARACTERISTIC ANECDOTES ABOUT INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF PATENT MEDICINES HOW HE HAD KNOWN WHOLE FAMILIES KILLED BY TAKING THEM HOW MORE THAN HALF THE INFANT MORTALITY OF GREAT BRITAIN WAS OWING TO THEIR UNRESTRICTED SALE
THE AMOUNT OF RUNNING ABOUT WE HAD TO DO AND THE WAY IN WHICH MISTER BENYON URGED US ON THE PERSPIRATION WAS RUNNING OFF FROM US IN STREAMS I HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A SWEATER BEFORE I DO LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER MISTER BENYON WOULD CONSTANTLY REMARK
SPIRITS OF THE AIR IN WHOSE PRESENCE I NOW STAND I ASK YOU IF I AM NOT JUSTIFIED IN WHATEVER I MAY DO HIS VOICE WAS VERY MUSICAL
I HERE VENTURE TO REPORT IT WHEN THEY FIRST ASKED ME TO PLAY I THOUGHT THEY WERE MAD STORWELL ON SEA IS A VILLAGE ON THE SOUTH COAST I BEG PARDON
MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WERE MAD EITHER THAT OR ELSE THAT THEY WERE PLAYING IT OFF ON THE UNPROTECTED STRANGER I HINTED SO MUCH TO THE DEPUTATION THE DEPUTATION SMILED
OR HIS GHOST WHAT WAS MORE SOME OF OUR OWN TEAM TOOK COURAGE AND LEG BAIL I CAUGHT ONE OF THEM THE LAD FENNING IN THE ACT OF SCRAMBLING THROUGH THE HEDGE BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO STOP HIM I ONLY WISHED THAT I HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO HAVE LED THE VAN
HE DREW ONE OUT AND THREW IT UP TO ME MY SECOND BALL WAS A COLOURABLE IMITATION OF MY FIRST ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS WIDE TO LEG TO LONG LEG MISTER BENYON SENT IT FLYING PUT DOWN TOM BENYON ANOTHER SIX HE CRIED I DO LIKE YOUR BOWLING MISTER
SUFFICIENT I TRUST TO BRING THE MATTER BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
MARGARET A GLASS OF AUNT JANE'S JALAP BUT GEORGE I ASSURE YOU THAT I NEVER DO TAKE MEDICINE SOME PEOPLE'S WINE IS NO BETTER THAN MEDICINE WE DRINK THAT AND PRETEND WE LIKE IT WHY NOT JALAP
IT FIGURES NICELY BUT GIVE ME FACTS HOW LONG DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WILL TAKE US TO REACH THAT SALE NO TIME THE NAME WILL SELL IT AUNT JANE'S JALAP THERE ISN'T AN OLD WOMAN IN ENGLAND WHO SEEING THOSE WORDS STARING HER IN THE FACE
HAVE SUCH A THING AS A CRICKET BALL IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
SO I SAID I SAY NOTHING AND THE IDEA WILLYUM OF YOUR TALKING ABOUT TAKING ME TO BATTERSEA PARK WHEN AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW IT IS RAINING CATS AND DOGS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED' BECAUSE
OUT OF THE AVERAGE BOWLER AND MISTER BENYON'S LAST PERFORMANCE HIS SNICK HAD PLACED HIM AT THE OTHER WICKET PREPARED TO RECEIVE MISTER SAPSWORTH'S BOWLING WHEN IT CAME NOW BOB SAPSWORTH
I WISHED I HAD SAMPLED IT BEFORE AS IT WAS IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
NOW HE HAD ON A BRIGHT RED FLANNEL SHIRT HIS TASTES IN COSTUME SEEMED A TRIFLE LURID THE SLEEVES OF WHICH WERE TURNED UP ABOVE THE ELBOWS HIS POSE WAS ALMOST AS PECULIAR AS HIS COSTUME HE STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT
IT IS AN ERROR WHICH CAN EASILY BE RECTIFIED HE RAISED HIS HAND A PIECE OF PAPER FLUTTERED FROM THE CEILING IT FELL UPON THE TABLE IT WAS THE TESTIMONIAL YOUR SIGNATURE MAJOR HARDINGE
I HAVE SENT FOR YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS MORNING TO ASK YOU FRANKLY IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR TREATMENT HERE THE PRISONER STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS WITH HIS FAMILIAR GESTURE HAVE YOU ANY
SHOULD HEAD THE LIST I I I'D RATHER SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNED FIRST THAT WOULD NEVER DO IT IS FOR YOU TO LEAD THE VAN YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE YOUR SEAT THE MAJOR LEFT HIS SEAT
AND WHICH I COULDN'T HELP AND THAT'S HOW IT IS I'M A LITTLE BEHIND I SEE I SAID AND IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH PINT POTS I HAVE NO DOUBT SO HE SAT DOWN ON A SEAT WHICH WAS WET OWING TO THERE BEING A DRIZZLE ON
THE SAME PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVABLE IN THE CHIEF WARDER WHO FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THE PRISONER'S HEELS MANKELL SEEMED AS EVER COMPLETELY AT HIS EASE
IT WAS CONSUMED TO ASHES BEFORE IT REACHED THE FLOOR RETURNING TO FACE THE GOVERNOR GAIN THE PRISONER LAID HIS RIGHT HAND PALM DOWNWARDS ON THE TABLE
I HAVE WORKED FOR AND EARNED MY LITTLE PILE SUCH AS IT IS AND UNTIL I SET OUT UPON THAT PLEASURE TOUR IN THE EAST
IN DISTRUSTING HIS MAGIC POWERS AND SO CASTING A STAIN UPON HIS CHARACTER THIS IS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAS PROVED TO THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF THE UNDERSIGNED INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
TELL YOU HOW IT IS DONE HOW WHAT IS DONE HOW YOU DO THAT HANKY PANKY OF COURSE HANKY PANKY THE PRISONER DREW HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP
IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO MENTION SUCH IMPERTINENCE IN ORDER TO DESPISE IT AS WE OUGHT AS TO THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO ENTERTAIN A FALSE IDEA THAT PARISIAN LADIES ARE COQUETTES OR FORWARD IN THEIR MANNERS AND BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING IS ALLOWABLE IN A LARGE CITY
TO AVOID GARMENTS TOO TIGHT OR TOO SHORT AND NOT TO HAVE IN VIEW IN THEIR TOILET ANY OTHER OBJECT BUT EASE AND NEATNESS UNLESS THE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH OR COMPLETE BALDNESS REQUIRES THEM TO WEAR A WIG EIGHT
WHEN IT IS NOT A MERE WORK OF LOQUACITY MAY BE EMPLOYED IN SERIOUS DISCOURSE AS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR MORAL DISCUSSIONS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TREAT IT WITH INFINITE RESERVE AND CARE AND NEVER TO INTRODUCE A PERSONAL APOLOGY
DO AWAY THIS UNJUST PREJUDICE MY FEMALE FRIENDS IT WILL BE BOTH EASY AND PLEASANT YOU WILL HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE INFLUENCE OF AN ELEVATED SOUL A PURE TASTE YOU WILL HAVE BUT TO REMIND YOURSELVES THAT SIMPLICITY IS THE COQUETRY OF GENIUS
SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCELLENT TO RELATE CONSULT LESS YOUR OWN DESIRE TO TELL IT THAN THE WISHES OF OTHERS TO HEAR YOU THERE ARE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF WEARYING WHILE TELLING VERY GOOD THINGS
AS WE REMAIN BUT A MOMENT WITH THESE GENTLEMEN AND AS THEY HAVE BUSINESS WITH A GREAT MANY PEOPLE THE OBSERVANCES AND FORMS OF POLITENESS WOULD BE MISPLACED THE FOLLOWING ARE POINTS TO BE OBSERVED BY THEM AND ARE BY NO MEANS RIGID
OR BY A NOT LESS FOOLISH DESIRE OF MAKING A DISPLAY OF TALENT REMEMBER THAT THE MOST MEAGRE RECITALS WHEN THEY ARE APROPOS FREQUENTLY PLEASE MORE THAN THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY ARE SAID OUT OF TIME
BEING ONCE ENGAGED TO TAKE PART IN THE DANCE IF THE FIGURES ARE NOT FAMILIAR BE CAREFUL NOT TO ADVANCE FIRST
A PARTICULAR AND LIMITED SENSE IT SIGNIFIES A WANT OF DUE REGARD TO AND A FORGETFULNESS OF THE DELICATE ATTENTIONS WHICH SEEM TO IDENTIFY US WITH THE SITUATION OF OTHERS
OR AT LEAST MAKE SIGNS OF IT IF THEY SHOULD DETAIN US WE STEP ASIDE AND APPEAR TO BE EXAMINING A PICTURE OR LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT WE TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT ENGAGES THEM
THAT LIKE ALL OTHER QUALITIES POLITENESS HAS ITS TRIALS
APPROPRIATE TO THE DRAWING ROOM THE NICEST CLOTH NEW AND VERY FINE LINEN AN ELEGANT BUT PLAIN WAISTCOAT A BEAUTIFUL WATCH TO WHICH IS ATTACHED A SINGLE COSTLY KEY
IT IS INDEED IRKSOME ENOUGH TO SHOW A GREAT QUANTITY OF GOODS AND GIVE PATTERNS OF THEM
FOR SOMETIMES THIS TEMPTS THEM TO PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH HIS POLITENESS SHOULD BE ALL LOST HE SHOULD STILL EXPRESS HIS REGRET AT NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO SUIT THE LADY AND HOPE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE ANOTHER TIME
THOSE NEAR WHOM WE ARE PLACED TO STEP UPON THE DRESS OF A LADY OR RUN AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE MOVING AT A MODERATE PACE IF YOU GO WITH A PARTY TO A THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT
THE SHOPKEEPER SHOULD SALUTE HIM POLITELY WITHOUT INQUIRING AFTER HIS HEALTH UNLESS HE BE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HE THEN WAITS UNTIL THE CUSTOMER HAS MADE KNOWN HIS WISHES ADVANCES TOWARD HIM OR BRINGS FORWARD A SEAT
WHEN YOUNG PERSONS OUGHT SO CAREFULLY TO AVOID MAKING A PARADE OF A VAIN COLLEGE ERUDITION AND NOT SEEK THE REPUTATION OF A SAVANT BY EMPLOYING WORDS BORROWED FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGES OR SCIENTIFIC TERMS UNKNOWN IN GOOD SOCIETY
AND THEY SHOULD BE TEMPERED WITH A SORT OF JUDGMENT THE SKILFUL USE OF WHICH IS ITSELF EVEN A EULOGIUM I REPEAT AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID
WITH WHICH THEY ARE CONTINUALLY OCCUPIED LET THEM ALWAYS BE IN FEAR OF OBTAINING THE NAME OF A BEL ESPRIT A NAME WHICH CALLS UP SO MANY RECOLLECTIONS OF PEDANTRY AND AFFECTATION A GRACEFUL SIMPLICITY
THEY WILL EITHER PREVENT THE SPEAKER FROM BEING UNDERSTOOD OR THEY WILL GIVE HIM THE AIR OF SANCHO PANZA BUT THE PREVIOUS REMARK HOWEVER NEED BE BUT SHORT AS THE PROVERB SAYS AS THE WISDOM OF NATIONS HAS IT
IF HE MAKES US A PRESENT OF ANY OF HIS PRODUCTIONS WE SHALL OWE HIM A CALL OR AT LEAST A BILLET OF THANKS HANDSOME COMPLIMENTS AND LIVELY TESTIMONIALS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OUGHT TO FILL UP THIS VISIT OR BILLET REMEMBER ALSO
THESE THINGS ARE RETURNED THE NEXT DAY BY A DOMESTIC WHO IS CHARGED TO THANK THE PERSON FOR THEM IF THE ARTICLES ARE LINEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED BEFORE THEY ARE WASHED WHEN A LADY HAS BORROWED ORNAMENTS OF ANOTHER
THAT POWERFUL MEANS OF OBTAINING CONSIDERATION BY ITS ELEVATED AND RELIGIOUS NATURE IS NOT WITHIN OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS
GENTLEMEN MAY CALL IN AN OUTSIDE COAT IN BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AS WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS IN SHORT THIS DRESS IS PROPER FOR GENTLEMEN'S VISITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND COMPARISONS THE TWO SHOALS TO BE AVOIDED IN THIS FORM OF LANGUAGE ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER THE ONE IS TRIVIALITY THE OTHER BOMBAST THE OBJECT OF SUPPOSITION WHICH IS ALREADY ANTIQUATED AND SOMETIMES TOO SIMPLE
THE PROPRIETIES IN DEPORTMENT WHICH CONCERTS REQUIRE ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN EVERY OTHER ASSEMBLY OR IN PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS FOR CONCERTS PARTAKE OF THE ONE AND THE OTHER
WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO PUT THE FOOT ON THE MIDDLE OF THE PAVING STONES AND NEVER ON THE EDGES FOR IN THAT CASE ONE INEVITABLY SLIPS INTO THE INTERSTICE BETWEEN ONE PAVEMENT AND ANOTHER WE MUST BEGIN BY SUPPORTING THE TOE BEFORE WE DO THE HEEL
CONSIDERATIONS OF A MORE ELEVATED NATURE AS OF GOOD DOMESTIC ORDER THE DIGNITY OF A WIFE AND THE DUTIES OF A MOTHER COME IN SUPPORT OF THIS LAW OF PROPRIETY FOR IT CONCERNS MORALITY IN ALL ITS BRANCHES
HAVE FREQUENTLY GIVEN TO THESE ATTENTIONS THE NAMES OF COQUETRY AMBITION OR FOLLY THIS IS A STILL STRONGER REASON WHY WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS
FURTHER A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD BREEDING SHOULD PROMPTLY OFFER HIS HAND TO LADIES EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT ACQUAINTANCES WHEN THEY PASS SUCH A PLACE YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MANNER OF WALKING
AND IF BY CHANCE ANY ILL BRED PERSON REQUESTS IT BEFORE YOU HAVE SEEN IT DO NOT DETAIN IT IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER THIS SMALL PRIVATION THAN TO PASS FOR A BADLY EDUCATED VIRTUOSO
APOLOGIZE TO THE SHOPKEEPER FOR THE TROUBLE YOU GIVE HIM IF AFTER ALL YOU CANNOT SUIT YOURSELF RENEW YOUR APOLOGIES WHEN YOU GO AWAY IF YOU MAKE SMALL PURCHASES SAY I ASK YOUR PARDON OR I AM SORRY FOR HAVING TROUBLED YOU FOR SO TRIFLING A THING
WE WILL MENTION SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE PARTICULAR VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS TO ACCOST SAD PEOPLE WITH A SMILING FACE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNERS WHICH PROVE TO THEM THE LITTLE INTEREST WHICH YOU TAKE IN THEIR SITUATION
DO NOT BE IN HASTE TO ASK FOR IT OR TO TAKE IT BY REACHING OUT YOUR HAND WAIT MODESTLY UNTIL IT COMES TO YOU DO NOT EXAMINE IT TOO LONG WHEN YOU HAVE IT
IS TO INCREASE THE FORCE OF REASONING AND TO CARRY CONVICTION TO THE MIND OF THE PERSON WHO LISTENS TO YOU
A PROVERB WELL APPLIED AND PLACED AT THE END OF A PHRASE FREQUENTLY MAKES A VERY HAPPY CONCLUSION I ONLY SPEAK TO CENSURE I ENTREAT MY READERS NOT TO SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE THE MANUFACTURERS OF PUNS
FOR A HUSBAND OR A WIFE IS ANOTHER SELF AND WE MUST FORGET THAT SELF MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR SPARE NO CARESSES TOWARDS YOUR CHILDREN OCCUPY YOURSELVES ENTIRELY WITH THEM
WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU TO MAKE THIS REQUEST BUT WILL USE EVERY EXERTION TO ANTICIPATE IT WE MUST OBSERVE HOWEVER WHETHER AGE SEX OR DRESS PRESENT NO OBJECTION FOR SOMETIMES ONE WOULD BE TREATED WITH ILL HUMOR AND CONTEMPT
BUT IF THEY REFLECT UPON IT THEY WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE EVEN ON THIS SUBJECT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THINGS PROPER TO BE MENTIONED WHEN YOU ARE PASSING IN THE STREET AND SEE COMING TOWARDS YOU A PERSON OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WHETHER A LADY A MAN RAISED TO DIGNITY OR AN ELDERLY PERSON
MARRIED PERSONS WHO IN SOCIETY PLACE THEMSELVES CONTINUALLY NEAR
WHICH MAKE A LACKEY'S OFFICE OF A TRULY RESPECTABLE PROFESSION THE CLERKS SHOULD CARRY THE ARTICLES PURCHASED TO THE DESK
SO THAT WE MUST BEGIN BY FULFILLING EXACTLY OUR DUTIES TOWARDS RELATIONS BUT WE MUST BEWARE OF MAKING PUBLIC THOSE PETTY QUARRELS AND LITTLE DIFFERENCES OF INTEREST OF ILL HUMOR OR OPINION
HE WAITS UPON SUCH IMPERIOUS PURCHASERS WITH READINESS BUT NEVERTHELESS IN SILENCE FOR HE MUST BE CONVINCED THAT THE MORE COMPLYING WE ARE TO PEOPLE OF THIS SORT THE MORE HAUGHTY AND DIFFICULT THEY SHOW THEMSELVES
THEN YOU SHOULD REPLY BRIEFLY BUT GIVE THEM ASSURANCES OF YOUR REGARD AND THANK THEM POLITENESS INFUSES INTO VISITS OF SOME LITTLE CEREMONY A COLORING OF MODESTY GRACE AND DEFERENCE WHICH SHOULD BE PRESERVED WITH THE GREATEST CARE IN SPEAKING
THE LATTER IS PLEASING CERTAINLY BUT THE FORMER IS CHARMING PUSSY PREFERS THE CHARMING WHILE OUR FRIEND THE DOG MERELY RUNS DOWN HIS PREY AND TAKES LITTLE PAINS TO SHOW SKILL EVEN IN THAT
ONLY ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON FOR NINE LONG YEARS THIS CAT MANAGED TO EVADE THE LAW AND ESCAPE THE ITCHING FINGERS OF THE KEEPERS AT LAST HOWEVER POOR GILBERT WAS TRAPPED AND SLAIN ONE DAY WHEN OUT SHOOTING
LEAVING RATS AND MICE ALONG WITH BLUE BOTTLE FLIES IN THE CATEGORY OF MERE KITTEN'S PLAY PUSSY'S GAME LIST INCLUDES HARES RABBITS STOATS WEASELS WATER RATS AND MOLES BESIDES EVERYTHING THAT FLIES OR HAS FEATHERS
FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE DOMESTIC CAT
PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS NEXT TO A CAT'S LOVE FOR CHILDREN IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT OUGHT TO MAKE ONE LOVE HER AND RESPECT HER AS A PET IT IS THE EXTREME PATIENCE
AND WATCH FOR THE RETURN OF HER MASTER OR MISTRESS BE THEY NEVER SO LONG ABSENT SHE KNOWS THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND JUMPS UP AT THEIR KNOCK AND RUNS TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM I KNOW OF A POOR CAT
AND PERSISTED IN THAT REFUSAL UNTIL THE EXPEDIENT WAS TRIED OF DROWNING THE REMAINING KITTEN
IS MASTER FOR ANYTHING IN THE FIELD WHICH SHE CONSIDERS GAME AND CHOOSES TO SQUARE HER MOUSTACHE AT EVEN TO A HUMAN BEING STALKING ONE'S PREY IS INFINITELY MORE ENGROSSING THAN THE MERE HUNTING OF IT
WHERE TO BEGIN AND WHAT SORT OF LAWS TO FRAME BEGIN I SAY BY PUTTING
OF VERY LITTLE PERSUASION MANAGED TO GET NEAR THIS CAT WAIF AND GIVE IT THE MOUSE THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH IT GOT THEM EVER AFTER SO LONG AS IT WAS IN LIFE
THESE ARE CURIOUS EXAMPLES OF MISTAKEN AFFECTION AND MAY BE PUT DOWN TO A SPECIES OF FELINE MANIA SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THAT WHICH IS SOMETIMES THOUGH RARELY SEEN IN HUMAN BEINGS
SHE KIDNAPPED AND CARRIED HOME ONE OF HER FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES WAS THE KITTEN TAKEN BACK AND EACH TIME PUSSY WENT AND STOLE IT AGAIN AND AS SHE NEVER FAILED TO GIVE THE OTHER CAT A PRELIMINARY HIDING
I KNEW A CAT IN THE ISLE OF MAN SHE HAD NO TAIL WORTH MENTIONING WHO USED TO MAKE THIS VERY HABIT OF THE RABBITS A MEANS OF SECURING HER PREY SHE USED TO ENTER ONE HOLE SUDDENLY AND AS SUDDENLY REAPPEAR STERN FIRST
AND EVEN IF WE DO BEING ALL NATURALLY SELFISH WE LIKE TO HAVE AND HOLD ALL WE CAN FOR THE LEAST POSSIBLE OUTLAY AND TROUBLE THUS
YOU DREAM OF DRAINS AND TYPHOID FEVER AND YOU SPRINKLE RIMMELL'S TOILET VINEGAR AND BURN PASTILES IN VAIN EVEN THE IMMORTAL CONDY FAILS TO LAY THE DREAD THING AT LAST YOU PEEP BELOW THE BED AND WITH THE TONGS PULL OUT WHAT
IF YOU HAD I DARE BE SWORN TUCKER WOULD HAVE ALIGHTED ON HIS FEET AT THE OTHER SIDE
WHY ON EARTH DOES HE WEAR A CRAVAT OUT OF DOORS A CRAVAT CRIED SHE OUR TOM WEAR A CRAVAT THEN THE PLEASANT LITTLE WOMAN LAUGHED TILL HER PLEASANT LITTLE SIDES SHOOK AND THE TEARS RAN OUT OF HER PLEASANT LITTLE EYES
OF COURSE BUNNY BY THIS TIME WAS SCAMPERING OFF TO THE OPPOSITE HOLE AND THERE AT THE DOOR PUSSY WOULD NAB HIM JUST AS HE CAME OUT CATS ALMOST INVARIABLY BRING HOME THEIR PREY TO BE EITHER LEISURELY EATEN
THAT MULTIPLIED BY TWENTY
AND BRINGING OUT LIVE FISH THIS IS TOLD AS A GREAT CURIOSITY BUT I CAN ASSURE THE READER THAT SUCH THINGS ARE BY NO MEANS RARE I HAVE KNOWN OF HUNDREDS OF SUCH CASES AND THEY ARE OCCURRING EVERY DAY JOE A NICE SHE TABBY
WHICH SHE EVINCES UNDER SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES THE MOST ACUTE WE TALK ABOUT DOGS BEING GAME AND TAKING THEIR DEATH EASY AND SO THEY MOSTLY DO UNDER EXCITEMENT
I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT CATS ARE UNFORGIVING OR THAT A FRIENDSHIP OF YEARS MAY BE CANCELLED IN A MOMENT BY AN ACCIDENTAL TREAD ON ITS TAIL OR FEET LOOK THE SAME PARTIES WILL TELL YOU
YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY SPRAWLING ON ALL FOURS HAVING TRAMPLED ON ONE OF GIBBEY'S SALMON OR YOU ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF GARDENING AND COME UPON A GRAVE AND TURN UP WHAT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS A NEWLY BORN INFANT ROLLED IN A RAG
FOR THE LAST FEW YARDS MAKING A RECKLESS BOLT TO THE FRONT DOOR PUSSY IS A VERY DAINTY ANIMAL CLEANLY IN THE EXTREME MORE PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE
TO THE DISTANT STREAMLET ANXIOUSLY SHE WOULD WATCH THE SKIMMING FLY SQUARING HER LIPS AND EMITTING LITTLE EXCITED SCREAMS OF DELIGHT WHENEVER A FISH ROSE TO NIBBLE THEN WHEN A TROUT WAS LANDED
I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THIS WAS RATHER SURPRISING BUT I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED NOW AT ANYTHING A CAT DID A GENTLEMAN THE OTHER DAY HAD A VERY NICE FOX TERRIER BITCH THE POOR THING DIED GIVING BIRTH TO A LITTER OF FOUR PUPPIES
FOR PUSSY COMMENCED LICKING IT ALL OVER AND FORTHWITH ADOPTED IT AND NURSED IT ALONG WITH HER KITTENS SHE CONTINUED TO DO SO UNTIL IT GREW INTO A LARGE LEGGY AND WITHAL RATHER UNGAINLY HEN
ALL CASES OF CRUELTY TO CATS TO BE PUNISHED BY FINES ET CETERA STARVING CATS TO BE PENAL I SHOULD HAVE AN INSPECTOR TO VISIT EVERY HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR AND SEE THAT THE CATS WERE IN GOOD CONDITION
I VERILY BELIEVE THEY DANCED TO IT SO FAILING THAT I GOT TWA KITTENS AND THREE WEEKS AFTER I HADN'T A RAT ABOUT THE PLACE BUT LOOKING AT THE MATTER STATISTICALLY IT IS THE VERY LOWEST AVERAGE TO SAY THAT EVERY CAT IN THIS COUNTRY
THEY WERE NO DOUBT SITTING CHEEK BY JOWL WHEN PUSSY MADE THE SPRING IF I TELL THE READER OF A CAT THAT IS SO CLEVER THAT SHE CAN CATCH SWALLOWS ON THE WING I SUPPOSE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO CLOSE THIS CHAPTER IN PEACE IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE YANKEE DOODLISH I CONFESS
FROM THE HUMBLE HOUSEHOLD SPARROW TO THE BLACK COCK OF THE MOUNTAIN NOT BEFORE A CAT REACHES MATURITY VIZ THREE YEARS OF AGE DOES THE PROPENSITY FOR OUT DOOR HUNTING BECOME A PASSION WITH HER BUT ONCE IMBUED WITH IT THE DESIRE NEVER LEAVES HER AS LONG AS SHE CAN RUN
AT PRESENT ONLY A VERY FEW OF OUR LEADING ARISTOCRACY AND GENTRY PATRONIZE CAT SHOWS BUT THEY ARE EVERY DAY BECOMING MORE AND MORE POPULAR BIRMINGHAM HAS EMULATED THE CRYSTAL PALACE AND EDINBURGH RIVALS BOTH
AND SHE INTIMATED TO ME THAT IT WAS ONLY THE BABY GIRL WITH WHOM SHE INTENDED TO FEED THE LITTLE BABY BOY AS HE HAD NOT GOT FAIR PLAY AND SO THE MAJESTY OF JUSTICE WAS MAINTAINED CATS ARE GREATLY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR OF MATERNITY
IN FACT ABOUT THIS TIME SHE ALWAYS APPEARS JOLLIER THAN AT ANY OTHER APPARENTLY LOOKING UPON THE WHOLE BUSINESS AS A CAPITAL LARK A RATHER ENJOYABLE PRACTICAL JOKE MY OWN CAT MUFFIE
A CAT NEVER SPRINGS ON HER PREY UNLESS SURE OF CATCHING IT AND HER AIM IS MOST UNERRING I KNOW A CAT THAT KILLED OVER A SCORE OF LARGE RATS IN ONE DAY AND ON ONE OF THESE SHE SPRANG FROM A HEIGHT OF NO LESS THAN TWELVE FEET
BUT MORE PARTICULARLY GOES IN FOR MOLE CATCHING WHEN SHE SPIES A MOLE HILL SHE AT ONCE SETS HERSELF DOWN TO WATCH IT NOR WILL SHE RAISE THE SIEGE FOR HOURS UNTIL THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN IN VELVET GIVES SIGNS OF HIS PRESENCE BY CASTING UP A FEW GRAINS OF EARTH
THAT MAKES OUR DOMESTIC CAT SUCH AN EXCELLENT HUNTER AND VERMIN KILLER WE ALL KNOW HOW PATIENTLY SHE WILL SIT IN A CORNER AND WATCH FOR A MOUSE OR RAT SHE KNOWS VERY WELL IT WILL COME SOONER OR LATER
THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT OF HIS ILLNESS HE BEGAN TO RALLY AND SOON GOT WELL AND PLUMP AND SLEEK AND THE OTHER DAY DIED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE BUT IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HOW
AND HER LAUGHING WAS SO PLEASANTLY INFECTIOUS THAT I WAS CONSTRAINED TO JOIN HER AND WE BOTH LAUGHED TILL ROOF AND RAFTERS RANG AGAIN IT WAS PLEASANT THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS LAUGHING AT
PARSONS MIGHT PREACH IN PEACE AND ACTORS RANT UNDISTURBED IT WOULD BE A BAD THING IN A BUSINESS WAY HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND THEIR FRIENDS THE UNDERTAKERS ARE CONCERNED FOR IF THE FORMER DID NOT WORK WITH ADDITIONAL ZEAL
HERE THE SMALLER TROUT FRY AND MINNOWS WOULD BE GAMBOLLING AND MAKING A SPRING PUSSY WOULD SEIZE ONE OF THESE AND BRING IT OUT ALIVE AFTER LETTING IT JUMP ABOUT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME TO AMUSE THE KITTENS AND ATTRACT THEIR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
SAID TUCKER POPPING OUT HIS HEAD AT A CORNER AS MUCH AS TO SAY NOT JUST YET FRIEND AND THE LAUGH WAS ALL AGAINST THE GROCER HOW PATIENTLY A CAT WILL WAIT FOR HER DINNER UNTIL EVERY ONE ELSE IS SERVED
WITH A LARGE POULTICE THEN SHE ROLLED HIM IN AN OLD SHAWL AND PUT HIM TO BED IN A BASKET TOM KEPT HIS BED FOR TEN DAYS DURING WHICH TIME SHE FED HIM FROM A PLATE NOT ALLOWING HIM TO GET UP
TO BE EITHER SOLD GIVEN AWAY OR DESTROYED CATS FOUND DOING DAMAGE TO GARDENS POULTRY RABBIT WARRENS OR PIGEON LOFTS TO BE CAPTURED IF POSSIBLE AND THE OWNERS MADE TO PAY DAMAGES
CATS ARE AS A RULE AVERSE TO WATER IN EVERY SHAPE IF EVERY ONE OF US WERE AS MUCH AFRAID OF GETTING DAMP FEET THERE WOULD BE MUCH LESS COUGHING IN CHURCH AND THEATRE
AND AT LENGTH FINDING ITS EFFORTS FRUITLESS IT LOOKS BEHIND THE GLASS AND APPEARS HIGHLY ASTONISHED AT THE ABSENCE OF THE FIGURE IT AGAIN VIEWS ITSELF AND TRIES TO TOUCH THE IMAGE WITH ITS FOOT SUDDENLY LOOKING AT INTERVALS BEHIND THE GLASS
AND SUPERSTITIOUS CATS WHO CURSE THEIR STARS CATS OF EACH CLASS CRAFT CALLING AND DEGREE MOURN DICK'S CALAMITOUS CATASTROPHE YET WHILE I CHANT THE CAUSE OF RICHARD'S END YE SYMPATHISING CATS YOUR TEARS SUSPEND
WHO PRETENDED GREAT POWERS OF DISCOVERING WITCHCRAFT AND WAS ENGAGED BY THE TOWNSMEN OF NEWCASTLE TO PRACTISE THERE AND ONE MAN AND FIFTEEN WOMEN WERE HANGED BY HIM BUT HE ULTIMATELY SHARED AS HOPKINS DID THE CRUEL FATE HE HAD AWARDED TO SO MANY OTHERS
AGAIN LET HERCULES HIMSELF DO WHAT HE MAY THE CAT WILL MEW AND DOG WILL HAVE HIS DAY THE WISDOM OF OUR FOREFATHERS TEACHES US THAT IF A CAT BE CARRIED IN A BAG FROM ITS OLD HOME TO A NEW HOUSE LET THE DISTANCE BE SEVERAL MILES
THE CAT HAS A MORE VOLUMINOUS AND EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY THAN ANY OTHER BRUTE THE SHORT TWITTER OF COMPLACENCY AND AFFECTION THE PURR OF TRANQUILITY AND PLEASURE THE MEW OF DISTRESS THE GROWL OF ANGER AND THE HORRIBLE WAILING OF PAIN
IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE BLACK CREATURE IN A TRYAL OF WITCHES AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR A WITNESS DEPOSED TO HAVING CAUGHT ONE OF THESE IMPS IN A BLANKET WAITING FOR HER CHILD WHO SLEPT IN IT AND WAS BEWITCHED
INSTANCES ARE FREQUENT I AM HAPPY TO TELL CAT HATERS OF ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN ATTACHED TO THE FELINE RACE AND OF CATS WHO HAVE MERITED SUCH ATTACHMENT MAHOMET WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN VERY FOND OF CATS
A CAT CAN LOOK ROUND PRETTY FAR BEHIND IT WITHOUT MOVING ITS BODY WHICH MIGHT BE APT TO STARTLE ITS PREY THE SPINE OF THE CAT IS VERY FULL AND LOOSE IN ORDER THAT ALL ITS MOVEMENTS IN ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE FREE AND UNRESTRAINED
IN AN OLD FASHIONED TREATISE UPON RAT CATCHING I FIND MENTIONED A MEANS OF ALLURING OF VERY MATERIAL EFFICACY WHICH IS THE USE OF OIL OF RHODIUM
THE BOOK OF DONKIES BY ONE OF THE FAMILY SOMEWHAT DISHEARTENED BY THE RECEPTION MY LITTLE PROJECT HAD MET WITH I GAVE UP THE IDEA FOR AWHILE AND WENT TO WORK UPON OTHER THINGS
THE SAME GAME IS CALLED PIGGIE I LEARN BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT A YOUNG WOMAN AT LEEDS NEARLY LOST HER EYE SIGHT BY A BLOW FROM ONE OF THESE PIGGIES OR CATS AND THE MAGISTRATES SENT THE BOY WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF IT TO AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL ORDERING HIS FATHER
THE FIELD IS OF THE SAPHIRE ON A CHIEF PEARLE A MASION CRUIEVES THIS BEASTE IS CALLED A MASION FOR THAT HE IS ENIMIE TO MYSE AND RATTES HE IS SLYE AND WITTIE AND SEETH SO SHARPELY THAT HE OVERCOMMETH DARKNESS OF THE NIGHTE
I GIVE THE AUTHOR'S WORDS AS I FIND THEM THE CAT IS A FAITHLESS DOMESTIC AND ONLY KEPT THROUGH NECESSITY TO OPPOSE TO ANOTHER DOMESTIC WHICH INCOMMODES US STILL MORE AND WHICH WE CANNOT DRIVE AWAY
FOR IT IS SAID THAT HE ONCE CUT OFF THE SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE RATHER THAN DISTURB HIS FAVOURITE WHILE SLEEPING ON IT PETRARCH WAS SO FOND OF HIS CAT THAT WHEN IT DIED HE HAD IT EMBALMED AND PLACED IN A NICHE IN HIS APARTMENT AND YOU OUGHT TO READ WHAT ROUSSEAU HAS TO SAY IN FAVOUR OF THE FELINE RACE
BUT THE WORD HAS ONE OR TWO OTHER MEANINGS FOR INSTANCE IN THIEVES SLANG THE WORD CAT SIGNIFIES A LADY'S MUFF AND TO FREE A CAT TO STEAL A MUFF AMONG SOLDIERS AND SAILORS A CAT MEANS SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT INDEED
IN HIS OPINION THE CAT IS A USEFUL BUT DECEITFUL DOMESTIC ALTHOUGH WHEN YOUNG IT IS PLAYFUL AND GAY IT POSSESSES AT THE SAME TIME AN INNATE MALICE AND PERVERSE DISPOSITION WHICH INCREASES AS IT GROWS UP AND WHICH EDUCATION LEARNS IT TO CONCEAL BUT NEVER TO SUBDUE
THE CAT APPEARS ONLY TO FEEL FOR HIMSELF ONLY TO LOVE CONDITIONALLY ONLY TO PARTAKE OF SOCIETY THAT HE MAY ABUSE IT AND BY THIS DISPOSITION HE HAS MORE AFFINITY TO MAN THAN THE DOG WHO IS ALL SINCERITY
CAN CLASP CAN CLIMB AND CAN STRIKE SIDEWAYS AND SEAT HERSELF AT A HEIGHT UPON A VERY NARROW SPACE THE LATERAL MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD IN CATS ARE NOT SO EXTENSIVE AS IN THE OWL BUT ARE NEVERTHELESS CONSIDERABLE
HE HAS GONE ALL OVER THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF ME AND AT LAST HAS TAKEN HIS SEAT BY THE FIRESIDE OR OUT IN THE GARDEN AND NURSED THE TROPHY OF HIS PROWESS UNTIL I RETURNED
ITS EARS ARE NOT SO MOVEABLE AS THOSE OF SOME OTHER ANIMALS BUT ARE MORE SO THAN IN VERY MANY ANIMALS THE SHAPE OF THE EXTERNAL EAR OR RATHER CARTILAGINOUS PORTION IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO INTERCEPT SOUNDS
AN INQUISITOR IN PIEDMONT BURNT A HUNDRED MORE AND WAS PROCEEDING SO FAST WITH OTHERS DAILY
AND SUBSTITUTE IT FOR A SUCKING PIG IN ANOTHER BAG WHICH HE SOLD TO THE UNWARY WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCE IF THE TRICK WAS DISCOVERED PREMATURELY IT WAS CALLED LETTING THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG IF NOT HE THAT MADE THE BAD BARGAIN
AND FINALLY A BLUNDERBUSS WAS LOADED TO SHOOT HER LOADED TO THE VERY MUZZLE BY CONJURATIONS AND ENCHANTMENTS WHEN THAT GUN WAS FIRED IT KNOCKED THE HOLDER BACKWARDS AND NEVER INJURED THE BLACK CAT ANOTHER MAN TRIED WITH THE SAME RESULT AND YET ANOTHER
AGUR IN THE BOOK OF PROVERBS REFERS TO SOME AND ALL THROUGH SCRIPTURE WE FIND ANIMALS USED AS TYPES OF HUMAN CHARACTER CATS MAY TEACH US PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE AND EARNEST CONCENTRATION OF MIND ON A DESIRED OBJECT
AND SINCERELY HOPE THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO AMUSE YOU BY MY VERSION OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO TELL WITH A GOOD MANY THINGS WHICH HAVE NOT YET APPEARED IN PRINT THAT I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF ONE THING I FOUND OUT VERY EARLY IN MY RESEARCHES AND THAT WAS
HENCEFORTH HE MEWS MIDST CHOIRS OF CATS DIVINE SO SINGS MISTER HUDDESFORD IN A MONODY ON THE DEATH OF DICK AN ACADEMICAL CAT WITH THIS MOTTO MI CAT INTER OMNES
AND TO THEIR AMOROUS MEWS ASSENTING PURR THERE LIKE ALCMENA'S SHALL GRIMALKIN'S SON IN BLISS REPOSE HIS MOUSING LABOURS DONE FATE ENVY CURS TIME TIDE AND TRAPS DEFY
HE WILL COMMIT A THIEF TO PRISON AND PROSECUTE HIM TO THE DEATH FOR THE CAT SIGNIFIES A COMMON THIEF IF HE DREAMS THAT HE EATS CAT'S FLESH HE WILL HAVE THE GOODS OF THE THIEF THAT ROBBED HIM IF HE DREAMS THAT HE HATH THE SKIN THEN HE WILL HAVE ALL THE THIEF'S GOODS
TO PRESERVE YOUR EYESIGHT BURN THE HEAD OF A BLACK CAT TO ASHES
THIS NOBLE BUILDING TO BE SURE HAS BEAUTY WITHOUT BOUNDS IT COST UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS THEY'VE MADAME CATALINI THERE TO OPEN HER WHITE THROAT BUT TO HEAR YOUR FOREIGN SINGERS I WOULD NOT GIVE A GROAT
TO YOU I OWE THAT CROWD OF BOYS WORRY ME WITH ETERNAL NOISE STRAWS LAID ACROSS MY PACE RETARD THE HORSE SHOES NAILED EACH THRESHOLD'S GUARD THE STUNTED BROOM THE WENCHES HIDE
LAY THE ANIMAL UPON YOUR KNEES AND APPLY THE RIGHT HAND TO THE BACK THE LEFT FORE PAW RESTING ON THE PALM OF YOUR LEFT HAND
WERE AGNES BRIDGES AND RACHEL PINDER WHO HAD COUNTERFEITED TO BE POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL AND VOMITED PINS AND RAGS BUT WERE DETECTED AND STOOD BEFORE THE PREACHER AT SAINT PAUL'S CROSS AND ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR HYPOCRITICAL COUNTERFEITING THIS HAPPENED IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
A MAY KITTEN MAKES A DIRTY CAT IS A PIECE OF HUNTINGDONSHIRE FOLK LORE SAYS MISTER CUTHBERT BEDE QUOTED TO ME IN ORDER TO DETER ME FROM KEEPING A KITTEN THAT HAD BEEN BORN IN MAY DOCTOR TURTON SAYS
CONTAINING A THEORY OF THE EARTH A GENERAL HISTORY OF MAN OF THE BRUTE CREATION AND OF VEGETABLES MINERALS ET CETERA OF WHICH MISTER BARR PUBLISHED AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION IN TEN GOODLY VOLUMES THUS IN THIS WORK OF WORLD WIDE CELEBRITY IS THE FELINE RACE DISCUSSED
UPON THE OTHER HAND PUSS HAS HAD HER DEFENDERS AND MISS ISABEL HILL WRITES THUS POOR PINKEY I CAN SCARCE DARE A WORD IN PRAISE OF ONE BELONGING TO THY SLANDERED SISTERHOOD
WITHOUT EITHER SLEEP OR MEAT AND SINCE THIS WAS THEIR UNGODLY WAY OF TRIAL WHAT WONDER WAS IT IF WHEN THEY WERE WEARY OF THEIR LIVES THEY CONFESSED MANY TALES THAT WOULD PLEASE THEM AND MANY TIMES THEY KNEW NOT WHAT HOPKINS FAVOURITE AND ULTIMATE METHOD OF PROOF WAS BY SWIMMING
LET US SEE THOUGH BEFORE WE TRY OUR ANECDOTES WHAT IS KNOWN OF THE CAT'S PECULIARITIES I RATHER LIKE THIS QUAINT DESCRIPTION OF THE DOMESTIC PUSSY WHICH OCCURS IN AN OLD HERALDIC BOOK JOHN BOSSEWELL'S WORKES OF ARMORIE PUBLISHED IN FIFTEEN NINETY SEVEN
AND FREQUENTLY BROUGHT THEM HOME ALIVE BESIDES MINNOWS AND EELS SHE OCCASIONALLY CARRIED HOME PILCHARDS ONE OF WHICH ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG WAS ONCE FOUND IN HER POSSESSION SHE ALSO CONTRIVED TO TEACH A NEIGHBOUR'S CAT TO FISH
THAT ALL THE WEIGHT OF HER BODY MIGHT REST UPON HER SEAT BY THAT MEANS AFTER SOME HOURS THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD WOULD BE STOPPED AND HER SITTING WOULD BE AS PAINFUL AS THE WOODEN HORSE
WHEN THE WITCH FINDER HAD DONE IN NEWCASTLE AND RECEIVED HIS WAGES HE WENT INTO NORTHUMBERLAND TO TRY WOMEN THERE AND GOT THREE POUNDS A PIECE
I HAVE NOTICED THIS OFTEN MYSELF AND HAVE SEEN THEM RUSH ABOUT IN A HALF WILD STATE JUST BEFORE WINDY WEATHER I THINK IT IS WHEN THE WIND IS RISING THAT THEY ARE MOST AFFECTED IT IS STATED IN A JAPANESE BOOK THAT THE TIP OF A CAT'S NOSE IS ALWAYS COLD
ARE IMPERFECT FLOWERS HANGING FROM TREES IN THE MANNER OF A ROPE OR CAT'S TAIL CAT'S MEAT CAT THYME AND CAT'S FOOT
AND AS MANY MORE IN THE COUNTRY AS MADE UP THREESCORE IN THIS WORK HE WAS AIDED BY ONE JOHN STERN AND A WOMAN WHO WITH THE REST PRETENDED TO HAVE SECRET MEANS OF TESTING WITCHCRAFT NOR WAS THEIR ZEAL UNREWARDED BY THE WEAK AND SUPERSTITIOUS PARLIAMENT
