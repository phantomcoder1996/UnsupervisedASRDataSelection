THIS SOUNDED NONSENSE BUT ALICE VERY OBEDIENTLY GOT UP AND CARRIED THE DISH ROUND AND THE CAKE DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE PIECES AS SHE DID SO NOW CUT IT UP SAID THE LION
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
IT'S VERY PROVOKING HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID AFTER A LONG SILENCE LOOKING AWAY FROM ALICE AS HE SPOKE TO BE CALLED AN EGG VERY
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
I HAVEN'T PRICKED IT YET THE QUEEN SAID BUT I SOON SHALL OH OH OH
SAID ALICE SEVERAL THOUSAND I SHOULD THINK FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THE KING SAID REFERRING TO HIS BOOK
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
BUT THERE'S ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE IN IT THAT ONE'S MEMORY WORKS BOTH WAYS I'M SURE MINE ONLY WORKS ONE WAY ALICE REMARKED I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN
THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
HE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER REMARK WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT WHICH ALICE DID NOT VENTURE TO DENY WHO DID YOU PASS ON THE ROAD THE KING WENT ON HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MESSENGER FOR SOME MORE HAY
AS IF SHE WERE FLYING AND ALICE VERY CIVILLY WENT TO MEET HER WITH THE SHAWL I'M VERY GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY ALICE SAID AS SHE HELPED HER TO PUT ON HER SHAWL AGAIN THE WHITE QUEEN ONLY LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS FRIGHTENED SORT OF WAY
I HAVEN'T INDEED ALICE SAID VERY GENTLY IT'S IN A BOOK AH WELL THEY MAY WRITE SUCH THINGS IN A BOOK HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN A CALMER TONE
FOR THE MESSENGER KEPT SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL AS HE CAME ALONG
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
AS WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND DRIPPING HAIR AND HANDS SHE SCRAMBLED BACK INTO HER PLACE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE HER NEW FOUND TREASURES
SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR OF COURSE HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKED DOUBTFUL I'D RATHER SEE THAT DONE ON PAPER HE SAID
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
COMING ON I WISH I COULD MANAGE TO BE GLAD THE QUEEN SAID ONLY I NEVER CAN REMEMBER THE RULE YOU MUST BE VERY HAPPY LIVING IN THIS WOOD AND BEING GLAD WHENEVER YOU LIKE ONLY IT IS SO VERY LONELY HERE
IN WINTER WHEN THE FIELDS ARE WHITE I SING THIS SONG FOR YOUR DELIGHT ONLY I DON'T SING IT HE ADDED AS AN EXPLANATION
NOW YOU SHALL SEE ME PIN IT ON AGAIN ALL BY MYSELF THEN I HOPE YOUR FINGER IS BETTER NOW ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY AS SHE CROSSED THE LITTLE BROOK AFTER THE QUEEN OH MUCH BETTER CRIED THE QUEEN HER VOICE RISING TO A SQUEAK AS SHE WENT ON
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
NO BUT I MEANT PLEASE MAY WE WAIT AND PICK SOME ALICE PLEADED IF YOU DON'T MIND STOPPING THE BOAT FOR A MINUTE
FOR THE SHOP WAS VERY DARK TOWARDS THE END THE EGG SEEMS TO GET FURTHER AWAY
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
HE CAN'T DO THAT
THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SAID ALICE AND HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS HAVE YOU ONE
IT MUST COME SOMETIMES TO JAM TO DAY ALICE OBJECTED NO IT CAN'T SAID THE QUEEN IT'S JAM EVERY OTHER DAY TO DAY ISN'T ANY OTHER DAY YOU KNOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID ALICE IT'S DREADFULLY CONFUSING
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
ALICE ASKED DOUBTFULLY OF COURSE IT MUST HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID WITH A SHORT LAUGH MY NAME MEANS THE SHAPE I AM
HE REMARKED TO HER AS HE MUNCHED AWAY I SHOULD THINK THROWING COLD WATER OVER YOU WOULD BE BETTER ALICE SUGGESTED OR SOME SAL VOLATILE I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS NOTHING BETTER THE KING REPLIED
BLEW THE QUEEN'S SHAWL ACROSS A LITTLE BROOK THE QUEEN SPREAD OUT HER ARMS AGAIN AND WENT FLYING AFTER IT AND THIS TIME SHE SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING IT FOR HERSELF
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THE QUESTION IS SAID ALICE WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
SHE SAID GOOD BYE ONCE MORE AND GETTING NO ANSWER TO THIS SHE QUIETLY WALKED AWAY BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THAT WAS A NICE CRAB YOU CAUGHT SHE REMARKED AS ALICE GOT BACK INTO HER PLACE VERY MUCH RELIEVED TO FIND HERSELF STILL IN THE BOAT WAS IT I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID ALICE
AS THE BOAT GLIDED BY THERE WAS ALWAYS A MORE LOVELY ONE THAT SHE COULDN'T REACH THE PRETTIEST ARE ALWAYS FURTHER SHE SAID AT LAST WITH A SIGH AT THE OBSTINACY OF THE RUSHES IN GROWING SO FAR OFF
HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
THE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES ONLY GOT MORE EXTRAORDINARY EVERY MOMENT WHILE THE GREAT EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
WITH JUST THE ENDS OF HER TANGLED HAIR DIPPING INTO THE WATER WHILE WITH BRIGHT EAGER EYES SHE CAUGHT AT ONE BUNCH AFTER ANOTHER OF THE DARLING SCENTED RUSHES I ONLY HOPE THE BOAT WON'T TIPPLE OVER SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH
THIS YOUNG LADY LOVES YOU WITH AN H THE KING SAID INTRODUCING ALICE IN THE HOPE OF TURNING OFF THE MESSENGER'S ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BUT IT WAS NO USE
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY MAY YET MAKE FAR GREATER PROGRESS PROVIDED THEY KEEP ALWAYS TO THE STRAIGHT ROAD THAN THOSE WHO WHILE THEY RUN FORSAKE IT
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
AND THE LAST IN EVERY CASE TO MAKE ENUMERATIONS SO COMPLETE AND REVIEWS SO GENERAL THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED THAT NOTHING WAS OMITTED
AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
SERVE FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BUILT THUS ALSO THOSE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FROM BEING AT FIRST ONLY VILLAGES HAVE BECOME IN COURSE OF TIME LARGE TOWNS
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
I JUDGED THAT NO SOLID SUPERSTRUCTURES COULD BE REARED ON FOUNDATIONS SO INFIRM AND NEITHER THE HONOR NOR THE GAIN HELD OUT BY THEM WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ME TO THEIR CULTIVATION FOR I WAS NOT THANK HEAVEN
THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER WHICH A PERSON BROUGHT UP FROM INFANCY IN FRANCE OR GERMANY EXHIBITS FROM THAT WHICH
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
WHICH IS PROPERLY WHAT IS CALLED GOOD SENSE OR REASON IS BY NATURE EQUAL IN ALL MEN
AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
BUT THEY GIVE US NO ADEQUATE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND FREQUENTLY THAT WHICH THEY DESIGNATE WITH SO FINE A NAME IS BUT APATHY OR PRIDE OR DESPAIR OR PARRICIDE I REVERED OUR THEOLOGY AND ASPIRED AS MUCH AS ANY ONE TO REACH HEAVEN
PROVIDED I TOOK THE FIRM AND UNWAVERING RESOLUTION NEVER IN A SINGLE INSTANCE TO FAIL IN OBSERVING THEM THE FIRST WAS NEVER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING FOR TRUE
TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
AND ALTHOUGH THIS SCIENCE CONTAINS INDEED A NUMBER OF CORRECT AND VERY EXCELLENT PRECEPTS THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SO MANY OTHERS AND THESE
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
ONE IS DISPOSED TO ALLEGE THAT CHANCE RATHER THAN ANY HUMAN WILL GUIDED BY REASON MUST HAVE LED TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND IF WE CONSIDER THAT NEVERTHELESS THERE HAVE BEEN AT ALL TIMES CERTAIN OFFICERS
AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY I WILL REVENGE MY INJURIES
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
A GROAN BURST FROM HIS HEAVING BREAST I PAUSED AT LENGTH HE SPOKE IN BROKEN ACCENTS UNHAPPY MAN DO YOU SHARE MY MADNESS HAVE YOU DRUNK ALSO OF THE INTOXICATING DRAUGHT
I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE THE INSIDE OF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE
THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
THAT WILLIAM HAD RUN AWAY TO HIDE HIMSELF AND THAT HE VAINLY SOUGHT FOR HIM
IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND
INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS IN EXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDING PLACE
AND ONE OF THESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED THIS I HIRED IT CONTAINED BUT TWO ROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLE PENURY THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED
SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
WHICH HAD DRIFTED TOWARDS US IN THE NIGHT ON A LARGE FRAGMENT OF ICE ONLY ONE DOG REMAINED ALIVE BUT THERE WAS A HUMAN BEING WITHIN IT WHOM THE SAILORS WERE PERSUADING TO ENTER THE VESSEL HE WAS NOT AS THE OTHER TRAVELLER SEEMED TO BE
WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
AND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDEN I WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MY OPERATIONS AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND
SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
AND MY HEART FAILED WITHIN ME WHEN ON LOOKING UP I SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THE DAEMON AT THE CASEMENT A GHASTLY GRIN WRINKLED HIS LIPS AS HE GAZED ON ME
MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT
SOME YEARS AGO HE LOVED A YOUNG RUSSIAN LADY OF MODERATE FORTUNE AND HAVING AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE SUM IN PRIZE MONEY THE FATHER OF THE GIRL CONSENTED TO THE MATCH HE SAW HIS MISTRESS ONCE BEFORE THE DESTINED CEREMONY
AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
AND SPARED NO PAINS TO DETECT AND PUNISH HIS DELIVERER THE PLOT OF FELIX WAS QUICKLY DISCOVERED AND DE LACEY AND AGATHA WERE THROWN INTO PRISON THE NEWS REACHED FELIX AND ROUSED HIM FROM HIS DREAM OF PLEASURE
SEVERAL PEOPLE CROWDED TOWARDS THE SPOT THEY SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED AT MY APPEARANCE BUT INSTEAD OF OFFERING ME ANY ASSISTANCE WHISPERED TOGETHER WITH GESTURES THAT AT ANY OTHER TIME
AND AVOIDED WITH SHUDDERING ANXIETY ANY ENCOUNTER WITH MY FELLOW CREATURES AT ONE TIME THE MOON
THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE HIS COMPANION WITH THIS RESOLUTION I TRAVERSED THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND FIXED ON ONE OF THE REMOTEST OF THE ORKNEYS AS THE SCENE OF MY LABOURS IT WAS A PLACE FITTED FOR SUCH A WORK
THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES
WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND
AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
AND OFTEN WHEN HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF UPON IT NO LONGER THAN A FEW MINUTES HE HAD GOT UP AGAIN AND HAUNTED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
MISTER LORRY SAW HIM SHRINK INTO THE EXACT FIGURE THAT DEFARGE HAD HAD IN KEEPING AFFECTED AND IMPRESSED WITH TERROR AS THEY BOTH WERE BY THIS SPECTACLE OF RUIN IT WAS NOT A TIME TO YIELD TO SUCH EMOTIONS
I HAVE HAD A PATTERN IN MY HAND HE GLANCED AT THE SHOE WITH SOME LITTLE PASSING TOUCH OF PRIDE AND THE MAKER'S NAME SAID DEFARGE NOW THAT HE HAD NO WORK TO HOLD HE LAID THE KNUCKLES OF THE RIGHT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE LEFT
GROWLING OVER IT LIKE ANY FOUR FOOTED INMATE OF A MENAGERIE TOWARDS NINE O'CLOCK HE SMOOTHED HIS RUFFLED ASPECT AND PRESENTING AS RESPECTABLE AND BUSINESS LIKE AN EXTERIOR AS HE COULD OVERLAY HIS NATURAL SELF WITH ISSUED FORTH TO THE OCCUPATION OF THE DAY
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
I HAVE OBSERVED HER TO DAY AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER OTHER DAYS I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE COURT AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE STREET BY THE PRISON LET ME BUT LIFT MY FINGER SHE SEEMED TO RAISE IT THE LISTENER'S EYES WERE ALWAYS ON HIS PAPER
YET MORE TENDERLY AND STRONGLY TO THE HOME YOU SO ADORN THE DEAREST TIES THAT WILL EVER GRACE AND GLADDEN YOU
AND HAD ONLY LEFT HER FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COME AND KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT HER FATHER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE QUITTED THE BANKING HOUSE TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK SHE HAD SOME FAINT HOPES THAT HIS MEDIATION MIGHT SAVE CHARLES BUT THEY WERE VERY SLIGHT
GENTLE THINGS EVEN MAGNANIMOUS THINGS SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PURITY OF HER FAITH IN THIS LOST MAN THAT HER HUSBAND COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WAS FOR HOURS AND O MY DEAREST LOVE SHE URGED
DON'T SAY THAT MISS MANETTE FOR YOU WOULD HAVE RECLAIMED ME IF ANYTHING COULD YOU WILL NOT BE THE CAUSE OF MY BECOMING WORSE SINCE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND THAT YOU DESCRIBE IS AT ALL EVENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOME INFLUENCE OF MINE
THEY TRIED SPEAKING TO HIM BUT HE WAS SO CONFUSED AND SO VERY SLOW TO ANSWER THAT THEY TOOK FRIGHT AT HIS BEWILDERMENT AND AGREED FOR THE TIME TO TAMPER WITH HIM NO MORE HE HAD A WILD LOST MANNER OF OCCASIONALLY CLASPING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
AND YET HE DID CARE SOMETHING FOR THE STREETS THAT ENVIRONED THAT HOUSE AND FOR THE SENSELESS STONES THAT MADE THEIR PAVEMENTS MANY A NIGHT HE VAGUELY AND UNHAPPILY WANDERED THERE WHEN WINE HAD BROUGHT NO TRANSITORY GLADNESS TO HIM
BUT I HAVE UNQUESTIONABLY SEEN FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THE FACE THAT I ONCE KNEW SO WELL HUSH LET US DRAW FURTHER BACK HUSH SHE HAD MOVED FROM THE WALL OF THE GARRET VERY NEAR TO THE BENCH ON WHICH HE SAT
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE AS OF HER OWN IF SHE HAD HAD A MIND SHE HAD NO MIND IN THAT DIRECTION CONSEQUENTLY SHE KNEW NO MORE OF THAT NONSENSE AS SHE WAS PLEASED TO CALL IT THAN MISTER CRUNCHER DID
SCARCELY NOTICING AS YET IN WHAT A CURIOUSLY RESERVED AND MECHANICAL WAY DEFARGE SPOKE MISTER LORRY PUT ON HIS HAT AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
ALL MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN NO MISTER CARTON I AM SURE THAT THE BEST PART OF IT MIGHT STILL BE I AM SURE THAT YOU MIGHT BE MUCH MUCH WORTHIER OF YOURSELF
WITH A WEARY SOUND THAT WAS NOT A SIGH NOR A GROAN HE BENT TO WORK AGAIN UNTIL THE SILENCE WAS AGAIN BROKEN YOU ARE NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE SAID MISTER LORRY LOOKING STEADFASTLY AT HIM
AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
BY THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS DEFARGE AND BY ONE OTHER WHAT OTHER DO YOU ASK CITIZEN DOCTOR YES
MISTER CRUNCHER HIMSELF ALWAYS SPOKE OF THE YEAR OF OUR LORD AS ANNA DOMINOES APPARENTLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CHRISTIAN ERA DATED FROM THE INVENTION OF A POPULAR GAME BY A LADY WHO HAD BESTOWED HER NAME UPON IT
DID YOU ASK ME FOR MY NAME ASSUREDLY I DID ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER IS THAT ALL ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER
AFTERWARDS SUPPING AT THEIR DOORS SCANTY AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPERS THOSE AND INNOCENT OF MEAT AS OF MOST OTHER SAUCE TO WRETCHED BREAD YET HUMAN FELLOWSHIP INFUSED SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE FLINTY VIANDS
THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS REFLECTIONS THEN THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DEED TO SEIZE THAT ARM LIFT IT AND STRIKE UNDER IT SHARP AND DEEP BUT HE WENT HIS WAY AND WAS SOON SWALLOWED UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE PRISON WALL
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
WEEP FOR IT AND IF WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU OF MY NAME AND OF MY FATHER WHO IS LIVING AND OF MY MOTHER WHO IS DEAD
HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
DEFARGE BROUGHT HIM THE WINE AND GAVE HIM GOOD EVENING HOW GOOD EVENING OH GOOD EVENING CITIZEN FILLING HIS GLASS AH AND GOOD WINE I DRINK TO THE REPUBLIC
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SOFTENED AND WAS MUCH DISTRESSED HE KNEW HER TO BE SO WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SAID PRAY FORGIVE ME MISS MANETTE
WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES YES RETURNED DEFARGE
BUT I WISH YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU INSPIRED IT WILL NOTHING OF IT REMAIN O MISTER CARTON THINK AGAIN TRY AGAIN NO MISS MANETTE ALL THROUGH IT I HAVE KNOWN MYSELF TO BE QUITE UNDESERVING
AND POINTING HER KNITTING NEEDLE AT LITTLE LUCIE AS IF IT WERE THE FINGER OF FATE
AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
MANY A DREARY DAYBREAK REVEALED HIS SOLITARY FIGURE LINGERING THERE AND STILL LINGERING THERE WHEN THE FIRST BEAMS OF THE SUN BROUGHT INTO STRONG RELIEF REMOVED BEAUTIES OF ARCHITECTURE IN SPIRES OF CHURCHES AND LOFTY BUILDINGS
THEY HAD NOT TRAVERSED MANY STEPS OF THE LONG MAIN STAIRCASE WHEN HE STOPPED AND STARED AT THE ROOF AND ROUND AT THE WALLS YOU REMEMBER THE PLACE MY FATHER YOU REMEMBER COMING UP HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
HE READILY RESPONDED TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND TOOK AND KEPT HER HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN THEY BEGAN TO DESCEND MONSIEUR DEFARGE GOING FIRST WITH THE LAMP MISTER LORRY CLOSING THE LITTLE PROCESSION
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
BOOK THE SECOND THE GOLDEN THREAD
AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
THE MATTER SEEMED PREYING ON HIS MIND AND SO I DETERMINED TO USE IT TO BE CRUEL ONLY TO BE KIND SO I SAID YOU LIKE LIFE AND YOU WANT LIFE OH YES BUT THAT IS ALL RIGHT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
IF WE FIND THEM ALL IN THAT HOUSE THEN OUR WORK IS NEAR THE END BUT IF THERE BE SOME MISSING WE MUST SEARCH UNTIL WE FIND THEM THEN SHALL WE MAKE OUR FINAL COUP AND HUNT THE WRETCH TO HIS REAL DEATH
OH MADAM MINA GOOD WOMEN TELL ALL THEIR LIVES AND BY DAY AND BY HOUR AND BY MINUTE SUCH THINGS THAT ANGELS CAN READ AND WE MEN WHO WISH TO KNOW HAVE IN US SOMETHING OF ANGELS EYES
BOTH OF WHOM WERE APPEASED WITH THE COIN OF THE REALM PUT ME ON THE TRACK OF BLOXAM HE WAS SENT FOR ON MY SUGGESTING THAT I WAS WILLING TO PAY HIS DAY'S WAGES TO HIS FOREMAN FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING HIM A FEW QUESTIONS ON A PRIVATE MATTER
I SOMETIMES THINK WE MUST BE ALL MAD AND THAT WE SHALL WAKE TO SANITY IN STRAIT WAISTCOATS LATER WE HAVE MET AGAIN WE SEEM AT LAST TO BE ON THE TRACK AND OUR WORK OF TO MORROW MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
TILL ON DESCENDING HE COULD DRINK THE OIL OF ALL THE CHURCH LAMPS CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IN THE PAMPAS AY AND ELSEWHERE
WHO HAD SLEPT OFF THE REMAINS OF HIS BEER ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AT CORCORAN'S HAD LEFT FOR HIS WORK AT POPLAR AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING HE COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE THE PLACE OF WORK WAS SITUATED BUT HE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US
IT IS THE COPY OF HIS JOURNAL WHEN ABROAD AND ALL THAT HAPPENED I DARE NOT SAY ANYTHING OF IT YOU WILL READ FOR YOURSELF AND JUDGE AND THEN WHEN I SEE YOU PERHAPS
IS NOT ONE TO BE INJURED IN PERMANENCE BY A SHOCK HIS BRAIN AND HIS HEART ARE ALL RIGHT THIS I SWEAR BEFORE I HAVE EVEN SEEN HIM SO BE AT REST I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO ASK HIM OF OTHER THINGS I AM BLESSED THAT TO DAY I COME TO SEE YOU
THE PROFESSOR TOOK AWAY ONE COPY TO STUDY AFTER DINNER AND BEFORE OUR MEETING WHICH IS FIXED FOR NINE O'CLOCK THE REST OF US HAVE ALREADY READ EVERYTHING SO WHEN WE MEET IN THE STUDY WE SHALL ALL BE INFORMED AS TO FACTS AND CAN ARRANGE OUR PLAN OF BATTLE
I SUPPOSE SO HE STOOD UP AND SAID SOLEMNLY THEN YOU ARE WRONG OH WOULD IT WERE SO BUT ALAS NO IT IS WORSE FAR FAR WORSE
THUS WHEN WE FIND THE HABITATION OF THIS MAN THAT WAS WE CAN CONFINE HIM TO HIS COFFIN AND DESTROY HIM IF WE OBEY WHAT WE KNOW BUT HE IS CLEVER I HAVE ASKED MY FRIEND ARMINIUS OF BUDA PESTH UNIVERSITY TO MAKE HIS RECORD
WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE PREYING ON THE BODIES AND THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVE BEST TO US FOR EVER ARE THE GATES OF HEAVEN SHUT FOR WHO SHALL OPEN THEM TO US AGAIN WE GO ON FOR ALL TIME ABHORRED BY ALL A BLOT ON THE FACE OF GOD'S SUNSHINE
FOR WHEN WE GET THE INFORMATION WHICH WE SEEK THERE WILL BE NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST STERILISE ALL THE IMPORTED EARTH BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET WE SHALL THUS CATCH THE COUNT AT HIS WEAKEST AND WITHOUT A REFUGE TO FLY TO
THERE WAS FIVE IN THE FIRST LOAD AN FOUR IN THE SECOND IT WAS MAIN DRY WORK AN I DON'T SO WELL REMEMBER OW I GOT OME I INTERRUPTED HIM WERE THE BOXES LEFT IN THE HALL
AND WE ARE IN GREAT HOPES THAT HIS CLUE MAY BE AN IMPORTANT ONE BEFORE GOING TO BED I WENT ROUND TO THE PATIENT'S ROOM AND LOOKED IN THROUGH THE OBSERVATION TRAP
EVENING A LONG AND TRYING AND EXCITING DAY BY THE FIRST POST I GOT MY DIRECTED ENVELOPE WITH A DIRTY SCRAP OF PAPER ENCLOSED ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN WITH A CARPENTER'S PENCIL IN A SPRAWLING HAND SAM BLOXAM
THE FIRST STEP WAS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE SO I ASKED HIM SPEAKING PRETTY LOUD SO THAT HE WOULD HEAR ME THROUGH HIS CLOSED EARS
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO
AND WHAT HE LIKE NOT WHERE HE LOVE IS NOT TO HIS GOOD THEREFORE FOR HIS SAKE YOU MUST EAT AND SMILE
HE OPENED HIS EYES A THOUGHT WIDER AND PAUSED A FEW SECONDS BEFORE REPLYING IT IS SOLD SIR PARDON ME I SAID WITH EQUAL POLITENESS BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL REASON FOR WISHING TO KNOW WHO PURCHASED IT
AS WIZARDS THERE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIES IN LIFE
THAT AT THE FIRST I WAS SCEPTIC WERE IT NOT THAT THROUGH LONG YEARS I HAVE TRAIN MYSELF TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THAT FACT THUNDER ON MY EAR SEE SEE I PROVE I PROVE ALAS
EVEN IF SHE BE NOT HARMED HER HEART MAY FAIL HER IN SO MUCH AND SO MANY HORRORS AND HEREAFTER SHE MAY SUFFER
I VOTE WE HAVE A LOOK AT HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW TIME IS EVERYTHING WITH HIM AND SWIFT ACTION ON OUR PART MAY SAVE ANOTHER VICTIM I OWN THAT MY HEART BEGAN TO FAIL ME WHEN THE TIME FOR ACTION CAME SO CLOSE BUT I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING
I HOPE I DID RIGHT IN NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF IT TO MISSUS WESTENRA I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF ANY ACT OF MINE WERE IT EVEN A NEGATIVE ONE BROUGHT HARM ON POOR DEAR LUCY
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM SAYING IN TURN LORD GODALMING I HAD THE HONOUR OF SECONDING YOUR FATHER AT THE WINDHAM I GRIEVE TO KNOW BY YOUR HOLDING THE TITLE THAT HE IS NO MORE HE WAS A MAN LOVED AND HONOURED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM
AS MADAM MINA SAW HIM ON THE WINDOW AT WHITBY AND AS FRIEND JOHN SAW HIM FLY FROM THIS SO NEAR HOUSE AND AS MY FRIEND QUINCEY SAW HIM
IT WAS HALF PAST TWO O'CLOCK WHEN THE KNOCK CAME I TOOK MY COURAGE A DEUX MAINS AND WAITED IN A FEW MINUTES MARY OPENED THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I ROSE AND BOWED AND HE CAME TOWARDS ME
AND IF THEY BROUGHT HIM ALL THE WAY FROM HOLLAND TO LOOK AFTER LUCY I FEEL FROM HAVING SEEN HIM THAT HE IS GOOD AND KIND AND OF A NOBLE NATURE WHEN HE COMES TO MORROW I SHALL ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN
WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER
THERE AIN'T A MANY SUCH JOBS AS THIS ERE AN I'M THINKIN THAT MAYBE SAM BLOXAM COULD TELL YE SUMMUT I ASKED IF HE COULD TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD GET ME THE ADDRESS IT WOULD BE WORTH ANOTHER HALF SOVEREIGN TO HIM
THE ORIGINAL VENDORS ARE THE EXECUTORS OF THE LATE MISTER ARCHIBALD WINTER SUFFIELD THE PURCHASER IS A FOREIGN NOBLEMAN COUNT DE VILLE WHO EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HIMSELF PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY IN NOTES OVER THE COUNTER
THAT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN EXACTLY ALMOST EVERY WORD SPOKEN EVEN IF YOU HAD TO REFINE SOME OF IT AFTERWARDS HERE WAS A RARE INTERVIEW I SHALL TRY TO RECORD IT VERBATIM
IS ALL THAT FEVER GONE AND IS HE STRONG AND HEARTY I SAW HERE AN OPENING TO ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN SO I SAID HE WAS ALMOST RECOVERED BUT HE HAS BEEN GREATLY UPSET
COME I SAID STERNLY NO MORE OF THIS WE HAVE HAD QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY
AT OTHER TIME HE CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THE TIME COME IT IS SAID TOO THAT HE CAN ONLY PASS RUNNING WATER AT THE SLACK OR THE FLOOD OF THE TIDE THEN THERE ARE THINGS WHICH SO AFFLICT HIM THAT HE HAS NO POWER AS THE GARLIC THAT WE KNOW OF AND AS FOR THINGS SACRED AS THIS SYMBOL MY CRUCIFIX
SHALL BE FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
HE MEANT THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND NOT LET A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH CHECK THE RUSH OF A BIG TRUTH LIKE A SMALL ROCK DOES A RAILWAY TRUCK WE GET THE SMALL TRUTH FIRST GOOD
POOR DEAR HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR ONLY IMAGINATION I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN IT AT ALL DID HE GET HIS BRAIN FEVER AND THEN WRITE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU IF I COULD MISTER HARKER AND ESPECIALLY WOULD I LIKE TO OBLIGE HIS LORDSHIP WE ONCE CARRIED OUT A SMALL MATTER OF RENTING SOME CHAMBERS FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
HE CAN FLOURISH WHEN THAT HE CAN FATTEN ON THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING EVEN MORE
YOU'VE GOT THEIR LIVES YOU KNOW AND YOU MUST PUT UP WITH THEIR SOULS SOMETHING SEEMED TO AFFECT HIS IMAGINATION FOR HE PUT HIS FINGERS TO HIS EARS AND SHUT HIS EYES SCREWING THEM UP TIGHTLY JUST AS A SMALL BOY DOES WHEN HIS FACE IS BEING SOAPED
WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
DESPISES THE MEANER FORMS OF LIFE ALTOGETHER THOUGH HE DREADS BEING HAUNTED BY THEIR SOULS LOGICALLY ALL THESE THINGS POINT ONE WAY HE HAS ASSURANCE OF SOME KIND THAT HE WILL ACQUIRE SOME HIGHER LIFE
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM I PAUSED GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME
THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
HE AND LOUISE HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER UNTIL THAT NIGHT GERTRUDE AND ALEX I MEAN JACK HAD GONE FOR A WALK ALTHOUGH IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND ANYBODY BUT A PAIR OF YOUNG GEESE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT DEW WAS FALLING AND THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF A SUMMER COLD
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A HOLE IN THE WALL MY TAKING THE DETECTIVE OUT TO SUNNYSIDE RAISED AN UNEXPECTED STORM OF PROTEST FROM GERTRUDE AND HALSEY I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IT
YOU MIGHT THINK OVER MY OFFER IN THE MEANTIME HE WENT ON THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM AND I LISTENED TO HIS FOOTSTEPS GROWING GRADUALLY FAINTER I DROPPED MY PRETENSE AT KNITTING AND LEANING BACK I THOUGHT OVER THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS
ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER THAT WAS THAT AUBREY WALLACE SHOULD EDUCATE HIS BOY
CONFOUND SUCH CARELESS WORK I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS TRUE ENOUGH WE GOT THE LIGHTS ON FINALLY AND LOOKED ALL THROUGH THE THREE ROOMS THAT CONSTITUTED THIS WING OF THE BASEMENT EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND EMPTY
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
OUR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR THE FIRST THROB OF THE MOTOR AS IT TURNED INTO THE DRIVE AND COMMENCED THE CLIMB TO THE HOUSE TEN MINUTES PASSED FIFTEEN TWENTY I SAW LOUISE'S HANDS GROW RIGID AS THEY CLUTCHED THE ARMS OF HER CHAIR
BETWEEN ONE O'CLOCK AND DAYLIGHT THERE WAS NONE UNTIL SIX A M THE NEXT QUESTION REQUIRED MORE DIPLOMACY DID YOU NOTICE ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN ANY PERSON
I WATCHED GERTRUDE'S BRIGHT COLOR SLOWLY EBBING AWAY AND AROUND MY OWN HEART I SEEMED TO FEEL THE GRASP OF A GIANT HAND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN A SOUND BUT IT WAS NOT THE CHUG OF THE MOTOR
BUT SHE LOOKED IN THE TRUNK ROOM AND SAW NOBODY SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM QUIETLY THE NOISE HAD CEASED AND EVERYTHING WAS QUIET THEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF HER BED AND FEELING FAINT
WOULD SIGNIFY HALSEY'S HAPPINESS OR WRETCHEDNESS AS IT MIGHT TURN OUT THEN TOO
THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
AND ALMOST A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE MONEY WAS FOR LUCIEN'S BOARD UNTIL SHE RECOVERED
SIT DOWN I SAID GRIMLY HAVE YOU FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL INCRIMINATE ME MISTER JAMIESON HE HAD THE GRACE TO LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE NO HE SAID IF YOU HAD KILLED MISTER ARMSTRONG YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT NO CLUES
ROSIE IS MISSING LIDDY SAID WITH UNCTION SHE HAD OBJECTED TO ROSIE THE PARLOR MAID FROM THE START MISSUS WATSON WENT INTO HER ROOM AND FOUND SHE HAD GONE WITHOUT HER HAT
ALL WERE IN THE COURSE OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO GET INTO THE CHIMNEY ROOM LOUISE AND HER MOTHER HAD FROM THE FIRST BEEN THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCKS THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO SEND LOUISE AWAY UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO INTERFERE BUT SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT C
AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
AND IT WAS THAT POISONING HAVING SET IN WHICH WAS KILLING HER
I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MISTER ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE ONE IS CURIOUS THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B INNES
BUT LIDDY CLENCHED THAT JUST ASK ALEX SHE SAID WHEN HE PUT THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THERE LAST NIGHT THE WALL WAS AS SMOOTH AS THIS THIS MORNING IT'S DUG OUT AND THERE'S PLASTER ON THE COOK'S TRUNK MISS RACHEL
WHEN YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR FACE AND STOPPED BAWLING I SAID COME INTO MY SITTING ROOM AND TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED LIDDY PUT AWAY MY THINGS WITHOUT SPEAKING THE VERY SET OF HER SHOULDERS EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL
THEN MORE LIGHTLY WHY YOU AND LIDDY NEED ME TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN YOU EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK PERHAPS I WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE
DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE NOW YOU ARE LOSING YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR GOOD LOOKS I SAID DECIDEDLY YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANGE I SHAN'T STIR A FOOT SHE WAS EQUALLY DECIDED
PART OF THE AFTERNOON I BELIEVE HE READ GERTRUDE AND I WERE OUT AS I HAVE SAID AND AT DINNER WE BOTH NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED TO DISTRACT HIM HE WAS DISAGREEABLE WHICH IS UNLIKE HIM NERVOUS
THE VOICES CEASED AT ONCE A DOOR CLOSED SOMEWHERE AND THE DOCTOR ENTERED FROM THE HALL OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY SURPRISED AT SEEING ME GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR I SAID FORMALLY
GERTRUDE SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME WANDERING THROUGH THE GROUNDS OR TAKING LONG CROSS COUNTRY WALKS HALSEY PLAYED GOLF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB DAY AFTER DAY AND AFTER LOUISE LEFT AS SHE DID THE FOLLOWING WEEK
IT DIDN'T MATTER MUCH ABOUT THE COOK'S FACE IF IT WAS CLEAN I HAVE SPOKEN OF HALSEY'S RESTLESSNESS ON THAT DAY IT SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN EVER A RESISTLESS IMPULSE THAT KEPT HIM OUT UNTIL AFTER LUNCHEON I THINK HE HOPED CONSTANTLY
HERE WAS I RACHEL INNES SPINSTER A GRANDDAUGHTER OF OLD JOHN INNES OF REVOLUTIONARY DAYS A D A R A COLONIAL DAME MIXED UP WITH A VULGAR AND REVOLTING CRIME AND EVEN ATTEMPTING TO HOODWINK THE LAW
HALSEY SAT ON THE RAIL WITH A PIPE OPENLY WATCHING LOUISE AS SHE LOOKED BROODINGLY ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE HILLS THERE WAS SOMETHING BAFFLING IN THE GIRL'S EYES AND GRADUALLY HALSEY'S BOYISH FEATURES
AT HALF PAST NINE I HEARD THE SOUND OF A HORSE DRIVEN FURIOUSLY UP THE DRIVE IT CAME TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THERE WERE HURRIED STEPS ON THE VERANDA OUR
SO BROKEN AND HALF COHERENT HOWEVER WAS HER STORY THAT I SHALL TELL IT IN MY OWN WAY IN AN HOUR FROM THE TIME I ENTERED THE CHARITY HOSPITAL I HAD HEARD A SAD AND PITIFUL NARRATIVE
INDEED FOR A TIME HE DID SO THEN HE REALIZED THAT LUCIEN WAS THE RULING PASSION IN THIS LONELY WOMAN'S LIFE HE FOUND OUT WHERE THE CHILD WAS HIDDEN AND THREATENED TO TAKE HIM AWAY ANNE WAS FRANTIC THE POSITIONS BECAME REVERSED
I WENT UP TO THE TRUNK ROOM WHICH WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY BEDROOM THE PLAN OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE HOUSE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE MAIN ONE END HOWEVER OVER THE EAST WING HAD BEEN LEFT ONLY ROUGHLY FINISHED
HE HAD GROWN INTO A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND HE WAS ALL ANNE HAD TO LIVE FOR THE ARMSTRONGS LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA AND ARNOLD'S PERSECUTIONS BEGAN ANEW HE WAS FURIOUS OVER THE CHILD'S DISAPPEARANCE
BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN THE DAY OF THE MOTOR CAR HAD COME NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE KEEPERS THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FLINDERS IF HALSEY HAD ONLY TAKEN ME FULLY INTO HIS CONFIDENCE THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SIMPLER IF HE HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER FRANK ABOUT JACK BAILEY
I SUGGESTED THAT ALEX THE GARDENER WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO HELP AND MISTER JAMIESON UNDERTOOK TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENT FOR ONE NIGHT HOWEVER MISTER JAMIESON PREFERRED TO WATCH ALONE APPARENTLY NOTHING OCCURRED
AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE CAME OUT AND CALLED ME TO THE TELEPHONE IT WAS ANNA WHITCOMB IN TOWN AND SHE KEPT ME FOR TWENTY MINUTES TELLING ME THE CHILDREN HAD HAD THE MEASLES AND HOW
AS SURE AS YOU SIT THERE THERE'S THE SMELL OF THE GRAVEYARD ON THEM
AND YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ANYTHING THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T HANDCUFF
TO AVOID ROUSING SUSPICION THEN I CAN WATCH FOR AT LEAST A PART OF EACH NIGHT AND PROBABLY MISTER INNES WILL HELP US OUT I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE TO THOMAS AS POSSIBLE THE OLD MAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT
PRANCING CURLY HAIRED LITTLE HORSE FLINDERS
AND THEN HE THREW THE BOLT BACK COME OUT
SHE WORE NOTHING BUT A STOCKING ON HER RIGHT FOOT AND IN SPITE OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR SHE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE'S SPRAINED ANKLE
SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
BUT I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT A STRANGER SOME OF YOU ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS AND I BELIEVE THERE IS NOT ONE HERE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO JOIN HEARTILY IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AS MISTER IRWINE PAUSED ARTHUR JUMPED UP
BUT TO ALL HIS ANXIOUS TENDER QUESTIONS SHE REPLIED WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS QUITE CONTENTED AND WISHED NOTHING DIFFERENT AND THE NEXT TIME HE SAW HER SHE WAS MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL
THE SIGHT OF THEM WOULD GIVE A MAN SOME ENERGY ARTHUR LOST HIMSELF AMONG THE NARROW OPENINGS IN THE FERN WINDING ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY ISSUE TILL THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED ALMOST TO NIGHT UNDER THE GREAT BOUGHS AND THE HARE LOOKED BLACK AS IT DARTED ACROSS HIS PATH
ADAM WAS LOOKING AT HETTY AND SAW THE FROWN AND POUT AND THE DARK EYES SEEMING TO GROW LARGER WITH PETTISH HALF GATHERED TEARS QUIET MARY BURGE WHO SAT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HETTY WAS CROSS AND THAT ADAM'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HER
AND HIS HOPE WAS FAR FROM BEING STRONG HE HAD BEEN TOO HEAVILY BURDENED WITH OTHER CLAIMS TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR HIMSELF AND HETTY A HOME SUCH AS HE COULD EXPECT HER TO BE CONTENT WITH AFTER THE COMFORT AND PLENTY OF THE FARM
AND HIS FRIENDS SHOULD DELIGHT TO HONOUR HIM I KNOW ADAM BEDE WELL I KNOW WHAT HE IS AS A WORKMAN AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN AS A SON AND BROTHER AND I AM SAYING THE SIMPLEST TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I RESPECT HIM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT ANY MAN LIVING
HETTY'S LITTLE BRAIN WAS BUSY WITH THIS COMBINATION AS SHE HUNG ON ADAM'S ARM AND SAID YES OR NO TO SOME SLIGHT OBSERVATIONS OF HIS
THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME HARDLY TWO MONTHS SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS
IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
AND AS LONG AS ADAM THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY HOPE OF HER HAVING HIM HE WOULD DO JUST WHAT SHE LIKED SHE KNEW BESIDES SHE MUST GO ON SEEMING TO ENCOURAGE ADAM LEST HER UNCLE AND AUNT SHOULD BE ANGRY AND SUSPECT HER OF HAVING SOME SECRET LOVER
THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
HE RUSHED BACK THROUGH THE WOOD AS IF HE WANTED TO PUT A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HETTY HE WOULD NOT GO TO THE HERMITAGE AGAIN HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD DEBATED WITH HIMSELF THERE BEFORE DINNER AND IT HAD ALL COME TO NOTHING WORSE THAN NOTHING HE WALKED RIGHT ON INTO THE CHASE
TO SPELL WITHOUT ANY OTHER MISTAKES THAN MUST IN FAIRNESS BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNREASONABLE CHARACTER OF ORTHOGRAPHY RATHER THAN TO ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE SPELLER AND MOREOVER TO LEARN HIS MUSICAL NOTES AND PART SINGING
SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
AFTER WHAT I SAW ON THURSDAY NIGHT HETTY HE BEGAN YOU WON'T THINK ME MAKING TOO FREE IN WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IF YOU WAS BEING COURTED BY ANY MAN AS UD MAKE YOU HIS WIFE AND I'D KNOWN YOU WAS FOND OF HIM AND MEANT TO HAVE HIM
PEOPLE ULL BE WONDERING TO SEE ME THERE AND THEY'LL LIKE ENOUGH BE GUESSING THE REASON AND ASKING QUESTIONS FOR THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK UP AND DOWN ABOUT MY HAVING THE PLACE THIS LAST THREE WEEKS WELL THEE CANST SAY THEE WAST ORDERED TO COME WITHOUT BEING TOLD THE REASON THAT'S THE TRUTH
AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
WHICH WAS BEING PUT IN REPAIR FOR THE SON OF A NEIGHBOURING SQUIRE AND HE HAD BEEN BUSY SINCE EARLY MORNING WITH THE PACKING OF PANELS DOORS AND CHIMNEY PIECES IN A WAGGON WHICH WAS NOW GONE ON BEFORE HIM WHILE JONATHAN BURGE HIMSELF HAD RIDDEN TO THE SPOT ON HORSEBACK
FOR SHE WAS GIVING ANGRY ATTENTION TO TOTTY WHO INSISTED ON DRAWING UP HER FEET ON TO THE BENCH IN ANTIQUE FASHION AND THEREBY THREATENED TO MAKE DUSTY MARKS ON HETTY'S PINK AND WHITE FROCK NO SOONER WERE THE LITTLE FAT LEGS PUSHED DOWN THAN UP THEY CAME AGAIN
AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
ONE ALONG BY THE HEDGEROW WHICH WILL BY AND BY LEAD HER INTO THE ROAD AGAIN THE OTHER ACROSS THE FIELDS WHICH WILL TAKE HER MUCH FARTHER OUT OF THE WAY INTO THE SCANTLANDS LOW SHROUDED PASTURES WHERE SHE WILL SEE NOBODY SHE CHOOSES THIS AND BEGINS TO WALK A LITTLE FASTER
BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
BEING A NEUTRAL IN THE DISPUTE HAD NO INTEREST BUT IN CONCILIATION THE SCHOOLMASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT WHO'S TO SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE MISTER MASSEY WHY THE BROADEST MAN SAID BARTLE AND THEN HE WON'T TAKE UP OTHER FOLKS ROOM
PULLING OUT HIS WATCH TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT BUT MY WATCH IS TOO FAST HOWEVER I'D BETTER NOT GO ANY FURTHER NOW TROT ALONG QUICKLY WITH YOUR LITTLE FEET AND GET HOME SAFELY GOOD BYE
OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HETTY SET OFF AND THE SLIGHT HOAR FROST THAT HAD WHITENED THE HEDGES IN THE EARLY MORNING HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE SUN MOUNTED THE CLOUDLESS SKY BRIGHT FEBRUARY DAYS HAVE A STRONGER CHARM OF HOPE ABOUT THEM THAN ANY OTHER DAYS IN THE YEAR
THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT WONDER WHEN I SAY THAT AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN THE ONE IN WHOM I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IS MY FRIEND MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE
THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD MISTER IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MISTER POYSER WHO
ADAM PICTURED TO HIMSELF MISSUS POYSER EXAMINING IT WITH HER KEEN EYE AND TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND OUT A DEFICIENCY AND OF COURSE CLOSE TO MISSUS POYSER STOOD HETTY AND ADAM WAS AGAIN BEGUILED FROM CALCULATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES INTO DREAMS AND HOPES
AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
WITH THAT PLUSHKIN DONNED HIS SPECTACLES AND ONCE MORE STARTED TO RUMMAGE IN THE CUPBOARD AND TO SMOTHER HIS GUEST WITH DUST AS HE UNTIED SUCCESSIVE PACKAGES OF PAPERS SO MUCH SO THAT HIS VICTIM BURST OUT SNEEZING
AND MUST THEREFORE BE SOUGHT FOR WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE WHILE THE SECOND DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR OF A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE WITH REGARD TO A MALEFACTOR WHO HAD THERE EVADED APPREHENSION A LETTER CONVEYING ALSO A WARNING THAT
UPON THAT CHICHIKOV INTIMATED THAT OUT OF RESPECT FOR HIS HOST HE HIMSELF WOULD BEAR THE COST OF THE TRANSFER OF SOULS THIS LED PLUSHKIN TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS GUEST MUST BE THE KIND OF UNCONSCIONABLE FOOL
I WILL LEAVE HIM THE WATCH IN MY WILL AS A KEEPSAKE MEANWHILE OUR HERO WAS BOWLING ALONG IN HIGH SPIRIT SUCH AN UNEXPECTED ACQUISITION BOTH OF DEAD SOULS AND OF RUNAWAY SERFS HAD COME AS A WINDFALL
HAVING HEARD SO MUCH OF HIS HOST'S BENEVOLENCE AND OTHER RARE QUALITIES OF SPIRIT HE HAD CONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY TO COME AND PAY A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT BUT PRESENTLY EVEN HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS WOULD BE OVERDOING THE THING
RETORTED THE OTHER I AM THE MASTER
WHICH AT LENGTH FORCED HER TO EJACULATE OH THE CURSED BUILDING POSITIVELY THERE IS NO END TO IT ALSO
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WE CANNOT HELP YOU BUT YOU MUST MAKE YOUR OWN RESOURCES AND TRY AS BEST YOU CAN TO HELP YOURSELF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS WENT IN AT ONE OF KOPEIKIN'S EARS AND OUT AT THE OTHER THAT IT WAS LIKE SHOOTING PEAS AT A STONE WALL
WAS AN HOUR SPENT FIRST OF ALL HE STROVE TO MAKE HIS FEATURES ASSUME AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE AND THEN AN AIR OF HUMBLE BUT FAINTLY SATIRICAL RESPECT AND THEN AN AIR OF RESPECT GUILTLESS OF ANY ALLOY WHATSOEVER NEXT
TO THE DEVIL WITH THAT SORT OF THING JUST NOW I WILL WAIT UNTIL I HAVE DRAWN MY PENSION
YES SAID NOZDREV WHY HAVE YOU GONE AND FRIGHTENED EVERYBODY AS YOU HAVE DONE
WAS THAT PLUSHKIN ONLY KEPT ONE PAIR OF BOOTS FOR THE WHOLE OF HIS DOMESTIC STAFF THIS UNIVERSAL PAIR WAS STATIONED IN THE HALL OF THE MANSION SO THAT ANY SERVANT WHO WAS SUMMONED TO THE HOUSE
TRULY IT WRINGS ONE'S HEART TO SEE TO WHAT LENGTHS IMMORALITY HAS COME SOME OF THE MEN HAVE QUITE LOST THEIR HEADS ABOUT HER BUT FOR MY PART I THINK HER NOT WORTH NOTICING OF COURSE AND HER MANNERS ARE UNBEARABLE
MIGHT WE POOR CUMBERERS OF THE GROUND MAKE SO BOLD AS TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF PRAY TELL US WHERE LIE THE HAPPY REGIONS IN WHICH YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WANDERING
REPLIED THE OTHER WARILY BUT I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CIVIL SERVICE OH OF THE CIVIL SERVICE AND PLUSHKIN SAT MOVING HIS LIPS AS THOUGH HE WERE CHEWING SOMETHING
IN PARTICULAR DID THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT TURN PALE AT THE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL WOULD SURMISE THE TERM DEAD FOLK TO CONNOTE PATIENTS IN THE LOCAL HOSPITALS WHO FOR WANT OF PROPER PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
AND SET OUT WOODEN LEG AND ALL TO SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION BUT FIRST HE ASKED WHERE THE PRESIDENT LIVED AND WAS TOLD THAT HIS HOUSE WAS IN NABEREZHNAIA STREET AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IT WAS NO PEASANT'S HUT
I SWEAR THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN SHORT HE MADE SUCH A SCENE THAT THE WHOLE VILLAGE CAME RUNNING TO THE HOUSE AND CHILDREN SCREAMED AND MEN SHOUTED
IS SHE A YOUNG WOMAN OR GOOD LOOKING OH DEAR NO QUITE AN OLD WOMAN SPLENDID INDEED
BUT HE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE NOT DEAD TIS I WHO TELL YOU THAT
ARE SUFFERING FOR YOUR OWN GOODNESS OF HEART BY GOD THAT IS TRUE THAT IS TRUE PLUSHKIN HUNG HIS HEAD AND WAGGED IT FEEBLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE YES
THAT LANDOWNER REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED CHICHIKOV AN EXCELLENT FELLOW AS WELL AS THAT THE SOULS WHOM HE HAD SOLD TO HIS VISITOR HAD BEEN IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD ALIVE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT ANSWER FOR ANYTHING
WHICH TO MANY OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESIROUS OF DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING SEEMED A PECULIARLY HORRIBLE INSTANCE OF BRAZEN FACED AUDACITY SO DEEPLY DID CHICHIKOV BECOME PLUNGED IN CONVERSATION WITH HIS FAIR PURSUERS OR RATHER
GET CLEAR OF THE LAWYERS NEVERTHELESS ADDED CHICHIKOV SEEING THAT YOU ARE SO HARD PRESSED FOR MONEY
AND HE STOOD WAITING IN GREAT SATISFACTION AT HAVING ARRIVED BEFORE THE PRESIDENT HAD SO MUCH AS LEFT HIS BED AND BEEN SERVED WITH HIS SILVER WASH BASIN NEVERTHELESS IT WAS ONLY WHEN KOPEIKIN HAD BEEN WAITING FOUR HOURS THAT A BREAKFAST WAITER ENTERED TO SAY
HAVING DONE THEIR BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE THE LADIES PARTY DESCENDED UPON THE MALE SECTION WITH A VIEW TO INFLUENCING IT TO THEIR OWN SIDE BY ASSERTING THAT THE DEAD SOULS
AND THROW IN ANOTHER TWO KOPECKS PARDON ME BUT I CANNOT
ACCORDINGLY THE SPEECH MENTALLY COMPOSED HE SAID ALOUD THAT HAVING HEARD OF PLUSHKIN'S TALENTS FOR THRIFTY AND SYSTEMATIC MANAGEMENT HE HAD CONSIDERED HIMSELF BOUND TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HOST AND TO PRESENT HIM WITH HIS PERSONAL COMPLIMENTS
BUT ON HIS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING FURTHER HIS TONGUE COMPLETELY FAILED HIM THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ADDED A WORD OR TWO AND THEN CARRIED OFF HER DAUGHTER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE OTHER GUESTS CHICHIKOV STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT
A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE GATHERING WAS THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF WHAT IS VULGARLY KNOWN AS COMMON SENSE IN GENERAL WE RUSSIANS DO NOT MAKE A GOOD SHOW AT REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLIES FOR THE REASON THAT UNLESS THERE BE IN AUTHORITY A LEADING SPIRIT TO CONTROL THE REST
SHE WAS HIGHLY OFFENDED WHEN SHE HEARD THE STORIES AND VERY JUSTLY SO
ALSO TO WHILE AWAY THE HOURS HE MADE NEW AND MORE DETAILED LISTS OF THE SOULS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT
PEERED INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE UNDER THE PRETENCE OF SEEING WHETHER HIS SERVANTS WERE BEING PROPERLY FED HE MADE A LIGHT MEAL OF CABBAGE SOUP AND GRUEL
AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM THAT HE TOO COULD NOT BEGIN A CONVERSATION BUT STOOD WONDERING HOW BEST TO FIND WORDS IN WHICH TO EXPLAIN THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT FOR A WHILE HE THOUGHT OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF TO THE EFFECT THAT
YOU ANSWER BACK WITH TEN GO AND FETCH ME A CANDLE TO SEAL A LETTER WITH AND MIND YOU BRING A TALLOW CANDLE FOR IT WILL NOT COST SO MUCH AS THE OTHER SORT AND BRING ME A MATCH TOO MAVRA DEPARTED AND PLUSHKIN SEATING HIMSELF
BY THE WAY I CAN TELL YOU OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE FOUND YOU SCOPE FOR YOUR SATIRICAL VEIN THE CONCLUSION AS TO CHICHIKOV'S SATIRICAL VEIN WAS AS BEFORE ALTOGETHER UNWARRANTED ON NOZDREV'S PART
I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT CHICHIKOV COULD EASILY HAVE ALLEGED A BETTER REASON
EVERY MOMENT SHE KEPT LOOKING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND PERCEIVING WITH ALMOST SPEECHLESS VEXATION THAT AS YET SHE WAS BUT HALF WAY ON HER JOURNEY
THAT THE HUTS WERE NO PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAIN AND THEREFORE SINCE THE LATTER ENTERED IN BUCKETFULS
AND LONG BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN USUALLY HE RETURNED TO THE INN IN HIS LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS DOOR OF COMMUNICATION BLOCKED WITH A WARDROBE HIS FRAME OF MIND REMAINED AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THE CHAIR IN WHICH HE WAS SEATED HIS HEART ACHED WITH A DULL UNPLEASANT SENSATION
AND AT FIRST CONSIGNED THE COMMISSIONAIRE TO THE DEVIL BUT AS SOON AS HE LEARNT FROM THE NOTE THAT SINCE A NOVICE AT CARDS WAS TO BE THE GUEST OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE THAT EVENING A CALL AT THE LATTER'S HOUSE MIGHT PROVE NOT WHOLLY UNPROFITABLE HE RELENTED
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO CARRY THE POSITION BY STORM FOR WHETHER MOVED BY THE INFLUENCE OF SPRING OR WHETHER MOVED BY A PUSH FROM BEHIND HE PRESSED FORWARD WITH SUCH DESPERATE RESOLUTION THAT HIS ELBOW CAUSED THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES TO STAGGER ON HIS FEET
YET HE WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE SURE SEEING THAT ALL OF US HAVE A SLIGHT WEAKNESS FOR SPARING OUR OWN FAULTS AND ALWAYS DO OUR BEST TO FIND SOME FELLOW CREATURE UPON WHOM TO VENT OUR DISPLEASURE
INDEED MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT CHICHIKOV WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN AN EMISSARY OF THE SAID GOVERNOR GENERAL SENT TO CONDUCT A SECRET INQUIRY
AND ALSO WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT HE NOZDREV HAD UNDERTAKEN TO AID AND ABET HIM IN THE ACT
AND THIS VERITY THE EPISTLE FURTHER CONFIRMED WITH ROWS OF FULL STOPS TO THE EXTENT OF NEARLY HALF A PAGE NEXT THERE FOLLOWED A FEW REFLECTIONS OF A CORRECTITUDE SO REMARKABLE THAT I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO QUOTE THEM WHAT
I MUST TELL YOU THAT NOTHING CAN BE DECIDED IN YOUR CASE WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT
YES HIM I KNOW WELL FOR WE WERE FRIENDS TOGETHER AT SCHOOL OVER PLUSHKIN'S WOODEN FEATURES THERE HAD GLEAMED A RAY OF WARMTH A RAY WHICH EXPRESSED IF NOT FEELING
OF COURSE I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TO BE ANYTHING OF THE KIND BUT YOU SEE THESE FELLOWS ARE IN A BLUE FUNK ABOUT THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL FOR THEY THINK HE WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR THEM OVER YOUR AFFAIR A PROPOS HE IS BELIEVED TO BE A MAN WHO PUTS ON AIRS AND TURNS UP HIS NOSE AT EVERYTHING
GO ROUND THE TABLE AT HIM I SUPPOSE BUT BEFORE THE BRAWL COULD ACHIEVE ITSELF THE MAN IN GAITERS INTERVENED NOT HERE HE SAID
I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
MAKING A MEMORABLE SAYING LET EM GO WHO CARES AND I WISH HIM LUCK AND BRING ME SOME BOURBON AS FAST AS YOU CAN THERE'S A GOOD CHAP
THAT IT WAS OFTEN THE FANCY OF SUCH GREAT FOLK TO SHUN THE BIG HOTELS THE ADULATION OF URBAN CROWDS AND SEEK INCOGNITO THE COSY QUAINTNESSES OF VILLAGE LIFE
TO BE A HUMAN BEING NOT A THING IN A HUTCH AND HE I KNOW SAID HOOPDRIVER AND NOW HERE I AM I WILL DO ANYTHING SAID HOOPDRIVER SHE THOUGHT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STEPMOTHER NO I COULD NOT DESCRIBE HER
SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER IF NOW AND THEN WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM A LESSON WELL
TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
CAME FLOATING IN ALL THROUGH SUPPER HE HAD BEEN COMPOSING
AND WITH WHAT WAS ONLY TOO PALPABLY A FOOTMAN GOOD HEAVENS
THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
CHARLES KINDLY BUT FIRMLY BY THE ARM IT'S BLASTED ROT CHARLES WAS SAYING
TOWARDS BISHOPS WALTHAM WITH MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN THE POST OF DANGER THE REAR EVER AND AGAIN LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SWERVING DANGEROUSLY AS HE DID SO
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
HE WAS EXPLAINING WITH A HAPPY FLUKE OF HIS IMAGINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS IGNORANCE THEN SUDDENLY HERALDED BY CLATTERING SOUNDS AND A GRIDE OF WHEELS
THE FACT OF IT IS SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SITTING BESIDE THE ROAD TO SALISBURY AND WITH THE SOUND OF DISTANT CHURCH BELLS IN HIS
WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE
HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
PROMISED TO HELP AND PROTECT ME I WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME NEVER MIND WHY A STEPMOTHER IDLE UNOCCUPIED HINDERED CRAMPED THAT IS ENOUGH PERHAPS THEN HE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND TALKED TO ME OF ART AND LITERATURE AND SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE
AND WITH THE VIOLENCE OF DESPAIR IT WAS A HIT OF HIS OWN DEVISING AN IMPROMPTU
IT WAS ANNIHILATION COMING NO LESS MISTER HOOPDRIVER DUCKED PERHAPS AND CERTAINLY GAVE GROUND TO THE RIGHT HIT AND MISSED CHARLES SWEPT ROUND TO THE LEFT MISSING GENEROUSLY
DAMNED UNPLEASANT PEOPLE DAMNED UNPLEASANT PEOPLE OH SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE GAITERS APPARENTLY MAKING A MENTAL INVENTORY OF HIS PEARL BUTTONS AS HE SPOKE HOW'S THAT
MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH TO BREAK THE INTENSITY HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SHUT IT AGAIN AND WITH A SUDDEN WINCING OF HIS FEATURES ABRUPTLY TURNED AND BENT DOWN TO OPEN THE LANTERN IN FRONT OF HER MACHINE SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
BUT IT CHANCED TO COINCIDE WITH THE REGULATION HOOK HIT AT THE HEAD HE PERCEIVED WITH A LEAP OF EXULTATION THAT THE THING HIS FIST HAD MET WAS THE JAWBONE OF CHARLES
THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
A SMELL OF COWS AND A PUMP STOOD OUT CLEAR AND BLACK THROWING A CLEAR BLACK SHADOW ON THE WHITEWASHED WALL AND HERE IT WAS HIS FACE WAS TO BE BATTERED TO A PULP
FOR HIS IDEAS WERE STILL A LITTLE HAZY ABOUT BECHAMEL AND MISSUS MILTON
BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO DAY SAID THE MAN IN THE VELVETEEN COAT YOU GOT TO DO IT CHARLIE SAID THE MAN IN GAITERS IT'S NO GOOD IT'S LIKE THIS SAID CHARLIE
WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY POWER I HAVE LOST AN ILLUSION AND FOUND A KNIGHT ERRANT SHE SPOKE OF BECHAMEL AS THE ILLUSION MISTER HOOPDRIVER FELT FLATTERED BUT HE HAD NO ADEQUATE ANSWER
WE HAVE TURNED AND TURNED AGAIN IT SEEMED TO HOOPDRIVER THAT HE HEARD HER SOB SHE STOOD DIMLY THERE HOLDING HER MACHINE AND HE HOLDING HIS COULD GO NO NEARER TO HER TO SEE IF SHE SOBBED FOR WEEPING OR FOR WANT OF BREATH
I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
THERE WERE SHOUTS LAUGHTER AND MISTER HOOPDRIVER STILL SOLEMNLY SQUARING REALIZED THE GREAT AND WONDERFUL TRUTH CHARLES HAD FLED HE HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT
YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR BROTHER MISS BEAUMONT YES WE COULD STOP THERE TOGETHER SHE TOOK A MINUTE TO ANSWER I AM GOING TO LIGHT THESE LAMPS SAID HOOPDRIVER HE BENT DOWN TO HIS OWN AND STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS SHOE
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
AND THE FLANKING MOVEMENT WAS COMPLETED ANOTHER BLOW BEHIND THE EAR HEAVEN AND EARTH SPUN FURIOUSLY ROUND MISTER HOOPDRIVER AND THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF A FIGURE IN A LIGHT SUIT
HE HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING HIS FEET HE FELT THAT HIS HEART WAS SMASHED FLAT GORD DARM SAID SOMEBODY DANCING TOE IN HAND SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM
HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
HE'S OFFERED TO HIT YOU AND IF I WAS HIM
HE CROSSED THE HALL BY THE BAR
HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME SAID JESSIE I COULD SEE HE BEGAN TO CALL TO ME BEFORE THE HORSE SHIED MY STEPMOTHER HAS SENT HIM
THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
AND HOW DID MEN CHANGE THE SOIL BY TILLING IT WITH THE PLOUGH TO SWEETEN IT AND MANURING IT TO MAKE IT RICH AND THEN DID ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GRASSES GROW UP OF THEMSELVES YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY MOST LIKELY DID NOT
WELL DONE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK SO
AND NOW BE OFF AND PLAY IN THE HAY AND COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
LOOK OH I REMEMBER NOW I KNOW NOW THE SOIL OF THE FIELD IS BROWN LIKE THE GARDEN
YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING OF THE REASON OF THINGS FOR THAT THIRST TO KNOW WHY WAS PUT INTO THE HEARTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN BY GOD HIMSELF AND I BELIEVE THAT GOD WOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT THIRST IF HE HAD NOT MEANT TO SATISFY IT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY FENCE AT THE MOORS AND WOODS THEY ARE FOREST WILD WALD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT INSIDE THE FENCE IS FIELD FELD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT
HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT WE MIGHT HURT HIM AND HOW AGAIN DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT WE SHALL NOT HURT HIM WE WHO FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS HAVE LET HIM AND HIS ANCESTORS BUILD UNDER THOSE EAVES IN PEACE HOW DID HE GET THAT QUANTITY OF HALF WIT
AND THEY WILL SEND YOU JUST THE SEEDS WHICH WILL GROW THERE AND NO OTHER AND THEN YOU HAVE A GOOD PASTURE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO KEEP IT GOOD AND HOW IS IT KEPT GOOD
AND WHEN HE SET FADE INTO DULL COLD GRAY TILL THE BRIGHT MOON CAME OUT TO LIGHT THEM UP ONCE MORE WHEN I WAS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING I WENT INTO BED
AND SHE IS AT WORK NOW MAKING YOU MAKING ME OF COURSE MAKING A MAN OF YOU OUT OF A BOY AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE LIFE BLOOD WHICH RUNS THROUGH AND THROUGH YOU AND THE MORE YOU LAUGH AND SHOUT
CHILDREN TOO WHO ARE UNHAPPY CHILDREN WHO ARE BULLIED AND FRIGHTENED AND KEPT DULL AND SILENT NEVER THRIVE THEIR BODIES DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP WEAK THEIR MINDS DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP DULL THEIR SOULS DO NOT THRIVE
THERE ARE THINGS WHICH NEITHER YOUR SENSES NOR YOUR BRAINS CAN TELL YOU AND THEY ARE NOT ONLY MORE GLORIOUS BUT ACTUALLY MORE TRUE
IT DROPS ITS VENOM INTO THE TENDEREST HEARTS ALAS AND MAKES THEM CALL WRONG RIGHT AND RIGHT WRONG LOVE CRUELTY AND CRUELTY LOVE
AND WANTED TO GO AGAIN AND MAKE OUT THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY FROM CARY'S OLD COUNTY MAPS WHICH WERE THE ONLY MAPS IN THOSE DAYS AND THEN BECAUSE THE HILL WAS CALLED CAMP MOUNT HE LOOKED FOR A ROMAN CAMP AND FOUND ONE AND THEN HE WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER SAW TWENTY THINGS MORE
BUT HAS PREPARED FOR THEM IN THEIR OWN LAND A HOME A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH THEY NOW LIVE BUT YOU ASK HOW OUGHT THEY TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE WOULD COME WELL
AND LOW SHOES WHICH ALWAYS CAME OFF IN STICKY GROUND AND TERRIBLY DIRTY AND WET HE IS BUT HE NEVER HE SAYS HAD SUCH A PLEASANT WALK IN HIS LIFE AND HE HAS BROUGHT HOME HIS HANDKERCHIEF
LIKE THE BUTTERCUPS WHICH DO SO MUCH HARM TO THIS PASTURE OR THEY SOWED ON SOIL WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THE SEED AND IT DIED BUT AT LAST
AND THE BEST PRAYER I CAN OFFER FOR YOU IS PERHAPS THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER NEED TO UNDERSTAND ME BUT IF THAT SORE NEED SHOULD COME AND THAT POISON SHOULD BEGIN TO SPREAD ITS MIST OVER YOUR BRAINS AND HEARTS THEN YOU WILL BE PROOF AGAINST IT JUST IN PROPORTION
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ALL THAT AWAY WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING IN ITS PLACE WHY NOT IF I TOOK ALL THE BUTTER OUT OF THE CHURN WHAT MUST I DO IF I WANT MORE BUTTER STILL
OR DAPPLES THE FIELD WITH WHITE OXEYES BUT IS NOT THE SORREL ITSELF RED AND THE OXEYES WHITE WHAT COLOUR ARE THEY AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS GONE DARK THAT IS NO COLOUR
BUT NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE HAY OR RATHER DO YOU AND THE REST GO AND PLAY IN THE HAY AND GATHER IT UP BUILD FORTS OF IT
THE FATHER SHOULD HELP LIKEWISE IS AS YOU WILL FIND OUT AS YOU GROW OLDER MORE WONDERFUL FAR SO THERE ALREADY THE OLD STARLING HAS SET US TWO FRESH PUZZLES ABOUT HOW AND WHY NEITHER OF WHICH WE SHALL GET ANSWERED
THAT SORT OF STUPID CUNNING INTO HIS LITTLE BRAIN AND YET GET NO MORE
COME UP AND LOOK AT IT AND SEE HOW SWIFT AND SMOOTH IT SHEARS THE LONG GRASS DOWN SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWATHE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MERELY FALLEN FLAT AND YOU MUST MOVE IT BEFORE YOU FIND THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT OFF AH
TO MY SON GRENVILLE ARTHUR AND TO HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS AT WINTON HOUSE THIS LITTLE BOOK IS DEDICATED PREFACE MY DEAR BOYS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
AND OTHER GASES EXPANDING THAT IS SPREADING OUT WITH WONDERFUL QUICKNESS AND STRENGTH OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM EXPAND AND THAT IS HEAT BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT YET
AND A LITTLE STITCHWORT AND PIGNUT AND MOUSE EAR HAWKWEED TOO WHICH NOBODY WANTS WHY
OH ROBERT HAD BEEN TO BROOM HEATH AND ROUND BY CAMP MOUNT AND HOME THROUGH THE MEADOWS BUT IT WAS VERY DULL HE HARDLY SAW A SINGLE PERSON HE HAD MUCH RATHER HAVE GONE BY THE TURNPIKE ROAD
SOMETHING VERY LIKE WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS TEMPTING GOD STAKING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR LIVES UPON THE CHANCES OF NO EARTHQUAKES COMING WHILE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE MIGHT COME ANY DAY THEY HAVE FULFILLED
YOU MIGHT STUDY THOSE GNATS AND FLIES FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE WITHOUT FINDING OUT ALL OR MORE THAN A VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY MOVE THOSE TINY WINGS OF THEIRS A THOUSAND TIMES IN A SECOND I DARE SAY SOME OF THEM
USE SO SAID MISTER ANDREWS AND SO I SAY DEAR BOYS
JUST AS THE BUTTER GROWS IN THE CHURN SO YOU MUST PUT FRESH GRASS STUFF CONTINUALLY INTO THE SOIL AS YOU PUT FRESH CREAM INTO THE CHURN YOU HAVE HEARD THE FARM MEN SAY THAT CROP HAS TAKEN A GOOD DEAL OUT OF THE LAND
GUESS WHY IS IT BECAUSE THE TREES INSIDE HAVE BEEN FELLED WELL SOME SAY SO WHO KNOW MORE THAN I BUT NOW GO OVER THE FENCE AND SEE HOW MANY OF THESE PLANTS YOU CAN FIND ON THE MOOR
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I WAS TRAVELLING IN THE PYRENEES AND I CAME ONE EVENING TO THE LOVELIEST SPOT A GLEN OR RATHER A VAST CRACK IN THE MOUNTAINS SO NARROW THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANYTHING AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
YOU MUST LEARN THE ALPHABET IF YOU MEAN TO READ AND YOU MUST LEARN THE VALUE OF THE FIGURES BEFORE YOU CAN DO A SUM WHY WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ANY ONE WHO SAT DOWN TO PLAY AT CARDS FOR MONEY TOO WHICH I HOPE AND TRUST YOU NEVER WILL DO
ON SUBJECTS WHICH WERE ONLY TALKED OF FIFTY YEARS AGO BY A FEW LEARNED MEN AND VERY LITTLE UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY THEM SO IF MERE READING OF BOOKS WOULD MAKE WISE MEN YOU OUGHT TO GROW UP MUCH WISER THAN US OLD FELLOWS
AND THE PRICE AND QUALITY OF THE LIQUOR ON THE OTHER HAND FRANKLIN COULD NOT CROSS THE CHANNEL WITHOUT MAKING OBSERVATIONS USEFUL TO MANKIND WHILE MANY A VACANT THOUGHTLESS YOUTH IS WHIRLED THROUGH EUROPE WITHOUT GAINING A SINGLE IDEA WORTH CROSSING THE STREET FOR
FOR THE SAKE OF A SET OF NESTLINGS WHO CAN BE OF NO GAIN OR USE TO HIM BUT ONLY TAKE THE FOOD OUT OF HIS MOUTH SIMPLY OUT OF WHAT SHALL I CALL IT MY CHILD LOVE THAT SAME SENSE OF LOVE AND DUTY
AND THOUGH I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THE REASONS OF THINGS OR SHOW YOU AUGHT BUT A TINY GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE OF THAT WHICH I CALLED THE OTHER DAY THE GLORY OF LADY WHY YET I BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMEWHEN SOMEWHERE
AND SO IT WAS WITH ME I DREAMED THAT SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD COME INTO THE HOTEL WHERE I WAS AND WERE SLEEPING IN THE ROOM UNDERNEATH ME AND THAT THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND FOUGHT AND BROKE THEIR BED DOWN WITH A TREMENDOUS CRASH
THAT WE MAY GUESS AT SOMETHING LIKE A GOOD REASON FOR THE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTH AMERICA I DO NOT WISH TO BE HARD UPON POOR PEOPLE IN GREAT AFFLICTION BUT I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PAST
MIGHT NOT THE STEAM TRY TO ESCAPE THROUGH THE CRACKS AND RATTLE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND SO CAUSE AN EARTHQUAKE SO THE STEAM WOULD ESCAPE GENERALLY EASILY AND WOULD ONLY MAKE A PASSING RATTLE
SHE WILL SET TO WORK FOR HERSELF THE RICH GRASSES WILL DWINDLE FOR WANT OF AMMONIA THAT IS SMELLING SALTS AND THE RICH CLOVERS FOR WANT OF PHOSPHATES
WHITEHALL WAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY THE NEWS THAT DICK TALBOT AS HE WAS COMMONLY CALLED HAD LAID A PLAN TO MURDER THE DUKE OF ORMOND THE BRAVO WAS SENT TO THE TOWER BUT IN A FEW DAYS
HE IN VIOLATION OF EVERY LAW OF HOSPITALITY AND GOOD FAITH REQUIRED THEM TO RENOUNCE THE CALVINISTIC RITUAL TO WHICH THEY WERE STRONGLY ATTACHED AND TO CONFORM TO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BEFORE HE WOULD DOLE OUT TO THEM ANY PORTION OF THE ALMS
WHAT WAS INNOCENT CONTRACTED A TAINT FROM PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HE MADE THE GROSSEST SATIRES OF JUVENAL MORE GROSS INTERPOLATED LOOSE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE TALES OF BOCCACCIO AND POLLUTED THE SWEET AND LIMPID POETRY OF THE GEORGICS
AND NO PART OF HIS CONDUCT TO HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE HAD INDICATED TENDERNESS ON HIS PART OR HAD BEEN CALCULATED TO CALL FORTH TENDERNESS ON HERS HE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO DISTURB HER DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE SINCERITY OF A CONVERSION BY WHICH THE CONVERT IS DIRECTLY A GAINER IN THE CASE OF DRYDEN THERE IS NOTHING TO COUNTERVAIL THIS PRESUMPTION HIS THEOLOGICAL WRITINGS ABUNDANTLY PROVE
BROUGHT HIM SAFE TO LAND AND THAT ON TWENTY FIELDS OF BATTLE THE CANNON BALLS PASSED HIM BY TO RIGHT AND LEFT THE ARDOUR AND PERSEVERANCE WITH WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS MISSION
BUT HIS CAPACITY WAS SCARCELY EQUAL TO WHAT HIS GREAT PLACE REQUIRED HE HAD BECOME SLUGGISH AND SELF INDULGENT LIKED THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE TABLE BETTER THAN BUSINESS AND ON GREAT EMERGENCIES
HE WAS SENT TO LONDON CHARGED WITH SEVERAL SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE WAS TO LAY THE GROUND FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE HE WAS TO ASCERTAIN AND REPORT THE STATE OF THE ENGLISH FLEETS
SOMETIMES POET SQUAB HE WAS REMINDED THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD PAID TO THE HOUSE OF CROMWELL
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
HE WAS REPRESENTED IN POPULAR LAMPOONS AS A MAN MADE TO BE DUPED AS A MAN WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE PREY OF GAMESTERS AND WHO MIGHT AS WELL BE THE PREY OF FRIARS A PASQUINADE
WOULD BE GREATER AND RICHER WHAT CHANCE THAT HE WOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO ESCAPE CONDIGN PUNISHMENT HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN LONG IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN WILLIAM AND MARY MIGHT BE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE AND LAW
SHE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED THAT IT WAS A FORGERY HER HUSBAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INGENUITY DEFENDED HIMSELF BY REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO BE SO BASE AS TO DO WHAT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
WAS A VERY SMALL PART OF WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM FRANCE ALONE HE DREW A REGULAR STIPEND OF NEAR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR BESIDES LARGE OCCASIONAL GRATUITIES HE HAD BARGAINED WITH TYRCONNEL FOR FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR
WAS TO HIM WHAT THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WAS TO HANNIBAL WHAT THE OTTOMAN POWER WAS TO SCANDERBEG
THE GREAT DESIGN WHICH HE MEDITATED HE WITH EXQUISITE SKILL PRESENTED TO DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS IN DIFFERENT LIGHTS AND IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THOUGH THOSE LIGHTS WERE DIFFERENT NONE OF THEM WAS FALSE HE CALLED ON THE PRINCES OF NORTHERN GERMANY
FOR HE NEVER BECAME AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAVED ENGLAND IT IS TRUE BUT HE NEVER LOVED HER AND HE NEVER OBTAINED HER LOVE TO HIM SHE WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF EXILE VISITED WITH RELUCTANCE AND QUITTED WITH DELIGHT
AROSE FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BATAVIAN REPUBLIC NO GREAT SOCIETY HAS EVER EXISTED DURING A LONG COURSE OF YEARS UNDER A POLITY SO INCONVENIENT THE STATES GENERAL COULD NOT MAKE WAR OR PEACE
NOT TO COUNTENANCE THIS BAD MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HIM EXCEPT HIS FINE PERSON AND HIS TASTE IN DRESS TALBOT WAS NOT ONLY WELCOME AT THE PALACE WHEN THE BOTTLE OR THE DICEBOX WAS GOING ROUND
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
PURITAN WRITERS WERE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO FOREIGN OR TO SECRET PRESSES PURITAN CONGREGATIONS COULD MEET ONLY BY NIGHT OR IN WASTE PLACES AND PURITAN MINISTERS WERE FORCED TO PREACH IN THE GARB OF COLLIERS OR OF SAILORS
THE AMUSEMENTS THE ARCHITECTURE THE LANDSCAPE OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HIS HEART TO HER HE TURNED WITH CONSTANT FONDNESS FROM A PROUDER AND FAIRER RIVAL IN THE GALLERY OF WHITEHALL
IT IS IN SOME SENSE AN ADVANTAGE TO HIM THAT HE IS DESTITUTE OF THOSE MORE SHOWY TALENTS WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM AN OBJECT OF ADMIRATION OF ENVY AND OF FEAR SIDNEY WAS A REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF THIS TRUTH INCAPABLE IGNORANT AND DISSIPATED AS HE SEEMED TO BE
MIGHT YET BE INDUCED BY THEIR COMMON JEALOUSY OF HER GREATNESS AND BY THEIR COMMON DREAD OF HER INTOLERANCE TO SUSPEND THEIR ANIMOSITIES TILL SHE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO OPPRESS THEM THIS PLAN SEEMED TO HIM TO HAVE ONE STRONG RECOMMENDATION
NAPLES AND MILAN MEXICO AND PERU
ON HIS AUSPICIOUS REAPPEARANCE JOIN THEIR ACCLAMATIONS TO THE ACCLAMATIONS OF HIS OLD FRIENDS THE CAVALIERS
THE ANABAPTIST BOAR GLARED FIERCELY AT THE SPOTLESS CREATURE YET SHE COULD VENTURE TO DRINK WITH THEM AT THE COMMON WATERING PLACE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HER FRIEND THE KINGLY LION THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS TYPIFIED BY THE PANTHER
NOW EXPRESSED IN NO MEASURED PHRASE THEIR RESOLUTION TO STAND AS MANFULLY BY THE CHURCH DULL AS WAS THE INTELLECT OF JAMES DESPOTIC AS WAS HIS TEMPER HE FELT THAT HE MUST CHANGE HIS COURSE
WILLIAM SAW WITH STERN DELIGHT HIS ADVERSARIES TOILING TO CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE FROM HIS PATH WHILE THEY RAISED AGAINST THEMSELVES THE ENMITY OF ALL SECTS HE LABOURED TO CONCILIATE ALL
THAT HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT WITH DILIGENCE AND ANXIETY TO LEARN THE TRUTH AND THAT HIS KNOWLEDGE BOTH OF THE CHURCH WHICH HE QUITTED AND OF THE CHURCH WHICH HE ENTERED WAS OF THE MOST SUPERFICIAL KIND NOR WAS HIS SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT
STILLINGFLEET'S PAMPHLETS AND BURNET'S BROAD SHOULDERS AND FORTUNATE MATRIMONIAL SPECULATIONS THE ABSURDITY OF THIS PLAN IS OBVIOUS IN TRUTH THE ALLEGORY COULD NOT BE PRESERVED UNBROKEN THROUGH TEN LINES TOGETHER
AND OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH SHE WAS BANISHED HIS EMPIRE OVER HER HEART WAS DIVIDED ONLY WITH HER GOD TO HER FATHER SHE HAD PROBABLY NEVER BEEN ATTACHED SHE HAD QUITTED HIM YOUNG MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN HIM
THE ANXIETY OF WILLIAM BECAME INTENSE FROM COMMON EYES HIS FEELINGS WERE CONCEALED BY THE ICY TRANQUILLITY OF HIS DEMEANOUR
THAT BELOVED CHURCH TOO FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD AFTER A PAINFUL STRUGGLE BROKEN THROUGH HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE THRONE WAS SHE REALLY IN SAFETY OR HAD HE RESCUED HER FROM ONE ENEMY ONLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER
BEEN SO DEEPLY CONCERNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE LATE RISING AGAINST THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT FOR VERY SHAME TALK AT THAT MOMENT ABOUT THE SACRED DUTY OF OBEYING NERO
COULD NOT CONCLUDE ANY ALLIANCE OR LEVY ANY TAX WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE STATES OF EVERY PROVINCE THE STATES OF A PROVINCE COULD NOT GIVE SUCH CONSENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF EVERY MUNICIPALITY WHICH HAD A SHARE IN THE REPRESENTATION
IN VAIN HAD HE BY VIRTUE OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL SUPREMACY ENJOINED THE CLERGY TO ABSTAIN FROM DISCUSSING CONTROVERTED POINTS EVERY PARISH IN THE NATION
WOULD BE ALMOST AS GREAT A CALAMITY AS A DEFEAT SUCH A VICTORY WOULD BE THE MOST CRUEL WOUND EVER INFLICTED ON THE NATIONAL PRIDE OF ONE OF THE PROUDEST OF NATIONS THE CROWN SO WON WOULD NEVER BE WORN IN PEACE OR SECURITY
AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
SHE OPENED THE CASKET AND FOUND IN IT SIX THOUSAND PISTOLES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JAMES ARRIVED AT SAINT GERMAINS LEWIS WAS ALREADY THERE TO WELCOME HIM
AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
AT LENGTH AFTER MANY EVENTFUL YEARS THE ASSOCIATES SO LONG PARTED WERE REUNITED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY WHOEVER HAS READ THE TALE OF THE HIND AND PANTHER WITH ATTENTION
THIS DEMANDS A STRENGTH THAT ELECTRICITY ALONE CAN GIVE ME CAPTAIN NEMO SAID SWIFTLY SIR I REPEAT THE DYNAMIC POWER OF MY ENGINES IS NEARLY INFINITE
HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PASS BEYOND THEM FARTHER ON LAY A PART OF THE GLOBE HE WOULD NO LONGER TREAD UNDERFOOT OUR RETURN JOURNEY BEGAN
TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE IT'S EASILY DONE ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
WE WERE IN FIVE METERS OF WATER AND THE TERRAIN HAD BECOME ALMOST FLAT
YOUR CHIEF SENSATION IS THE CONSTANT FEELING OF AN UNDERLYING CHASM AS THE DUTCHMAN JANSEN SO APTLY PUT IT BUT BELOW THE WAVES ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOUR HEART NEVER FAILS YOU
OR A COMMON SPERM WHALE THAT SOON DISAPPEARED AMID A CHORUS OF CURSES HOWEVER THE WEATHER HELD GOOD OUR VOYAGE WAS PROCEEDING UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS BY THEN IT WAS THE BAD SEASON IN THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND
THE NAUTILUS COVERED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM DECEMBER FOURTH TO THE ELEVENTH ITS NAVIGATING WAS MARKED BY AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN IMMENSE SCHOOL OF SQUID UNUSUAL MOLLUSKS
BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION
AT LEAST THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE REGRETTABLE FROM THE HUNTER'S STANDPOINT SEVERAL TIMES I SAW CAPTAIN NEMO STOP AND TAKE AIM WITH HIS RIFLE THEN AFTER SIGHTING DOWN ITS BARREL FOR A FEW SECONDS
AND IF I FILL THEM WITH WATER THE BOAT THEN DISPLACES ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT TWO METRIC TONS OR IT WEIGHS THAT MUCH AND IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED THAT'S WHAT COMES ABOUT PROFESSOR
IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
A QUIET WORK ROOM TRULY AT REST IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS EVEN SO CAPTAIN I SAID THERE IS ONE MAJOR SIMILARITY BETWEEN DUMONT D'URVILLE'S SLOOPS OF WAR AND THE NAUTILUS WHAT'S THAT SIR
TO THE NAUTILUS HE SAID THE LONGBOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES LATER WE ENCOUNTERED THE SHARK'S CORPSE AGAIN FLOATING FROM THE BLACK MARKINGS ON THE TIPS OF ITS FINS
IT HUGGED THIS SAND COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
THEN WE CROSSED A PRAIRIE OF ALGAE OPEN SEA PLANTS THAT THE WATERS HADN'T YET TORN LOOSE WHOSE VEGETATION GREW IN WILD PROFUSION SOFT TO THE FOOT
WHERE LASHED WITH ROPES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING WASHED OVERBOARD SOME HUMAN CORPSES STILL LAY I COUNTED FOUR OF THEM FOUR MEN ONE STILL STANDING AT THE HELM THEN A WOMAN HALFWAY OUT OF A SKYLIGHT ON THE AFTERDECK
NOT WRINKLED LIKE BEACH SAND WHICH PRESERVES THE IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY THE WAVES THIS DAZZLING CARPET WAS A REAL MIRROR THROWING BACK THE SUN'S RAYS WITH STARTLING INTENSITY THE OUTCOME
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
THE NAVAL ARSENALS WERE UNLOCKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT WHO PRESSED ENERGETICALLY FORWARD WITH THE ARMING OF HIS FRIGATE BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS JUST WHEN A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO CHASE THE MONSTER THE MONSTER PUT IN NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
I GAPED AT THE CAPTAIN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID TO ME NOT IN THE LEAST WELL COME ALONG AND YOU'LL SEE I HEADED TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY THERE VERY PUZZLED NED LAND AND CONSEIL WATCHED THE CREWMEN OPENING THE HATCHES
SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS
THE COUNT DE LA PEROUSE THEN WE RAISED THE FIJI ISLANDS WHERE SAVAGES SLAUGHTERED SAILORS FROM THE UNION AS WELL AS CAPTAIN BUREAU COMMANDER OF THE DARLING JOSEPHINE OUT OF NANTES FRANCE EXTENDING OVER AN EXPANSE OF ONE HUNDRED LEAGUES NORTH TO SOUTH
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS SIR TODAY IS JUNE FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT OR THE THIRTEENTH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
AND I SIDE WITH THE SCHOLARLY COMMANDER MAURY
HEAVY CLOUDS PASSED ABOVE US FORMING AND FADING SWIFTLY BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER
LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR DOESN'T IT HAVE THE ACTUAL GIFT OF LIFE DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP
BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
HOW TO EXCHANGE THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF PREARRANGED SIGNALS SO FOR LACK OF ANYTHING BETTER I TALKED TO MYSELF I DECLAIMED INSIDE THIS COPPER BOX THAT TOPPED MY HEAD
UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
THE LIGHT FROM OUR GLASS COILS PRODUCED MAGICAL EFFECTS AT TIMES LINGERING ON THE WRINKLED ROUGHNESS OF SOME NATURAL ARCH OR SOME OVERHANG SUSPENDED LIKE A CHANDELIER WHICH OUR LAMPS FLECKED WITH FIERY SPARKS
TO WHICH CAPTAIN DUMONT D'URVILLE HAD GIVEN THE NAME ISLAND OF THE SEARCH WE LAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE HARBOR OF VANA
MY REPLY OBVIOUSLY PLEASED CAPTAIN NEMO BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT I WAITED FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS
WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
WOULD BE THE MOVEMENTS WE ARE SAID TO BE IMAGINING WHETHER THIS IS THE CASE OR NOT MIGHT EVEN BE DECIDED EXPERIMENTALLY IF THERE WERE A DELICATE INSTRUMENT FOR RECORDING SMALL MOVEMENTS IN THE MOUTH AND THROAT
ALL THEIR EFFECTS OF WHATEVER NATURE FOLLOW MNEMIC LAWS BUT THIS DIFFERENCE IS LESS SUITABLE FOR DEFINITION THAN THE DIFFERENCE AS TO CAUSES PROFESSOR WATSON AS A LOGICAL CARRYING OUT OF HIS BEHAVIOURIST THEORY
IT IS OF COURSE UNDENIABLE THAT KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH THE SEEING BUT I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO REGARD THE MERE SEEING ITSELF AS KNOWLEDGE IF WE ARE SO TO REGARD IT WE MUST DISTINGUISH THE SEEING FROM WHAT IS SEEN WE MUST SAY THAT WHEN WE SEE A PATCH OF COLOUR OF A CERTAIN SHAPE
STILL NO MORE THAN A ROUGH GENERALIZATION A STATISTICAL AVERAGE IT CANNOT TELL US WHAT WILL RESULT FROM A GIVEN CAUSE ON A GIVEN OCCASION IT IS A LAW OF TENDENCY
THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT IT IS AN HYPOTHESIS AND FOR OUR PURPOSES AN UNNECESSARY ONE IT WOULD SEEM TO FIT BETTER WITH WHAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY OBSERVE IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT AN IMAGE IS OCCASIONED THROUGH ASSOCIATION
IF A SENSIBLE STIMULUS A CALLS UP AN IMAGE OF B AND WE THEN ACT WITH REFERENCE TO B WE HAVE WHAT MAY BE CALLED CONSCIOUSNESS OF B
IN ORDER THEREFORE TO ARRIVE AT WHAT REALLY IS SENSATION IN AN OCCURRENCE WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS TO CONTAIN NOTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO PARE AWAY ALL THAT IS DUE TO HABIT OR EXPECTATION OR INTERPRETATION
AND FREE FROM ALL CONVENIENT FICTIONS OR UNWARRANTABLE ASSUMPTIONS OF METAPHYSICAL ENTITIES
WHICH IT WOULD HAVE IF IT WERE A VISUAL SENSATION AND NOT MERELY A VISUAL IMAGE BUT THIS MEANS THAT THE SO CALLED UNREALITY OF IMAGES CONSISTS MERELY IN THEIR NOT OBEYING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
EVERYTHING IS SENSATION THAT COMES TO US THROUGH THE SENSES THE SIGHTS WE SEE THE SOUNDS WE HEAR THE SMELLS WE SMELL AND SO ON ALSO SUCH THINGS AS HEADACHE OR THE FEELING OF MUSCULAR STRAIN BUT IN ACTUAL FACT SO MUCH INTERPRETATION SO MUCH OF HABITUAL CORRELATION
IF WE IMAGINE SOME PIECE OF MUSIC THAT WE KNOW WE CAN GO THROUGH IT IN OUR MIND FROM BEGINNING TO END WITHOUT ANY DISCOVERABLE TENDENCY TO SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE REALLY HEARING IT BUT ALTHOUGH SUCH CASES ARE SO CLEAR THAT NO CONFUSION SEEMS POSSIBLE
AND POUR IT ON THE FIRE AND ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE ENSUES I ACCOUNT FOR ALL SUCH FACTS BY CALLING THIS WHOLE TRAIN OF EXPERIENCES UNREAL A MENTAL TRAIN MENTAL FIRE
WHEN WE CALL UP A VISUAL IMAGE OF A CHAIR WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIT IN IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LIKE MACBETH'S DAGGER IT IS NOT SENSIBLE TO FEELING AS TO SIGHT
I ASSUME THAT IS TO SAY A TRAINED OBSERVER WITH AN ANALYTIC ATTENTION KNOWING THE SORT OF THING TO LOOK FOR AND THE SORT OF THING THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT WHAT HE OBSERVES IS AT THE STAGE OF SCIENCE WHICH HE HAS REACHED
WILL THE ASSOCIATION WORK IN EITHER DIRECTION OR ONLY FROM THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED EARLIER TO THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED LATER IN AN ARTICLE BY MISTER WOHLGEMUTH CALLED THE DIRECTION OF ASSOCIATIONS
THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT OUR MENTAL LIFE IS BUILT UP OUT OF SENSATIONS ALONE THIS MAY BE TRUE BUT IN ANY CASE I THINK THE ONLY INGREDIENTS REQUIRED IN ADDITION TO SENSATIONS ARE IMAGES WHAT IMAGES ARE AND HOW THEY ARE TO BE DEFINED WE HAVE NOW TO INQUIRE
WHILE HE DEFINES IDEAS AS THE FAINT IMAGES OF THESE
IF WE APPLY OUR DEFINITION TO THIS CASE IT SEEMS TO DEMAND IMAGES OF IMAGES IN ORDER FOR EXAMPLE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN IMAGE OF A CAT WE SHALL REQUIRE ACCORDING TO THE LETTER OF THE DEFINITION
WE DO NOT HAVE A DATUM UNLESS WE HAVE A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION IN THE SENSE IN WHICH OBJECTS AS OPPOSED TO PROPOSITIONS ARE DATA IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL TO SAY THAT THOSE OBJECTS OF WHICH WE ARE CONSCIOUS ARE DATA
AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT IMAGES AND SENSATIONS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE IMAGES ALSO DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS AS REGARDS THEIR EFFECTS SENSATIONS AS A RULE HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFECTS
PERCEPTION THEN WILL CONSIST OF A PRESENT SENSATION TOGETHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE SENSATIONS THIS OF COURSE IS A REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS NOT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WAY PERCEPTION APPEARS TO UNCHECKED INTROSPECTION
NAMELY SUBJECTIVITY SUBJECTIVITY AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA
THERE REMAINS HOWEVER AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
TO SAY WE SEE THE NERVES IS LIKE SAYING WE HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE BOTH ARE CONVENIENT BUT INACCURATE EXPRESSIONS WE HEAR A SOUND WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE CAUSALLY CONNECTED WITH THE NIGHTINGALE
I SHALL THEN BRIEFLY SKETCH THE NATURE OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE THE TRUE METAPHYSIC IN WHICH MIND AND MATTER ALIKE ARE SEEN TO BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF A NEUTRAL STUFF WHOSE CAUSAL LAWS HAVE NO SUCH DUALITY AS THAT OF PSYCHOLOGY
DENIES ALTOGETHER THAT THERE ARE ANY OBSERVABLE PHENOMENA SUCH AS IMAGES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HE REPLACES THEM ALL BY FAINT SENSATIONS
AGAIN WORDS HEARD OR READ ENABLE YOU TO ACT WITH REFERENCE TO THE MATTERS ABOUT WHICH THEY GIVE INFORMATION HERE AGAIN A PRESENT SENSIBLE STIMULUS
MUST COUNT AS IMAGES YET WHILE WE ARE DREAMING THEY SEEM LIKE SENSATIONS HALLUCINATIONS OFTEN BEGIN AS PERSISTENT IMAGES AND ONLY GRADUALLY ACQUIRE THAT INFLUENCE OVER BELIEF THAT MAKES THE PATIENT REGARD THEM AS SENSATIONS
JUST AS MUCH AS PHYSICAL PHENOMENA DO BUT THEIR EFFECTS FOLLOW DIFFERENT LAWS FOR EXAMPLE DREAMS AS FREUD HAS SHOWN ARE JUST AS MUCH SUBJECT TO LAWS AS ARE THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS BUT THE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT IN A DREAM YOU MAY BE TRANSPORTED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN A MOMENT
B IS DEPENDENT UPON A IN RESPECT OF THIS RELATION
AND PARTLY BY GIVING RISE TO IMAGES AND MEMORIES AFTER THE SENSATION IS FADED BUT IN ITSELF THE PURE SENSATION IS NOT COGNITIVE IN THE FIRST LECTURE WE CONSIDERED THE VIEW OF BRENTANO
I WISH TO REINFORCE THE VIEW THAT THE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE IMAGES ARE OF VARIOUS SORTS ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE SENSATIONS WHICH THEY COPY
THAT IS TO SAY THEY GROUP TOGETHER PARTICULARS HAVING THE SAME ACTIVE PLACE WHILE PSYCHOLOGY GROUPS TOGETHER THOSE HAVING THE SAME PASSIVE PLACE
NOT ALSO IN THE SENSE ORGANS AND THE NERVES THAT RUN FROM THE SENSE ORGANS TO THE BRAIN I THINK THE PHRASE CENTRALLY EXCITED SENSATIONS ASSUMES MORE THAN IS NECESSARY SINCE IT TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT AN IMAGE MUST HAVE A PROXIMATE PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSE
IT REMAINS TO INQUIRE WHETHER ALL THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE ALSO DATA OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND ESPECIALLY OF PHYSIOLOGY IF WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN OUR ANALYSIS OF MIND
AS ON THE OTHER HAND IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT OUR IMPRESSIONS ARE SO FAINT AND LOW THAT WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM OUR IDEAS
THIS STATEMENT AT FIRST SIGHT IS ONE TO WHICH WE FEEL INCLINED TO ASSENT BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE MISTAKEN IF WE DO SO
SENSATION IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM DEMANDS THE EXISTENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
IT IS CALLED A BIOGRAPHY SUBJECTIVITY IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF PERSPECTIVES AND BIOGRAPHIES THE CHARACTERISTIC OF GIVING THE VIEW OF THE WORLD FROM A CERTAIN PLACE
THUS APART FROM CERTAIN RELATIONS THE OCCURRENCES WHICH SEEM MOST DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL AND FURTHEST REMOVED FROM PHYSICS ARE LIKE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
BUT NOT A THING OF WHICH WE MUST BE CONSCIOUS WE HAVE BEEN LED IN THE COURSE OF OUR INQUIRY
WHEN WE THINK OF A TABLE SAY AS OPPOSED TO SEEING IT WHAT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO HIM IS USUALLY THAT WE ARE MAKING SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE THROAT AND TONGUE SUCH AS WOULD LEAD TO OUR UTTERING THE WORD TABLE
WHILE MY SEEING IS NOT PHYSICAL BUT PSYCHICAL HENCE I CONCLUDED THAT THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN MY SEEING OF THE COLOUR THIS ARGUMENT TO ME HISTORICALLY WAS DIRECTED AGAINST IDEALISM THE EMPHATIC PART OF IT
AN IMAGE WHICH IS A COPY OF OUR IMAGE OF THE CAT AND HAS THIS IMAGE FOR ITS PROTOTYPE NOW IT HARDLY SEEMS PROBABLE AS A MATTER OF OBSERVATION THAT THERE ARE IMAGES OF IMAGES AS OPPOSED TO IMAGES OF SENSATIONS
IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSAL LAWS OF PSYCHOLOGY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS AND EXACT LAWS IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE MANY ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS IN PSYCHOLOGY NOT ONLY OF THE SORT BY WHICH WE GOVERN OUR ORDINARY BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER
WISH FOR A BEAUTIFUL PALACE FOR YOURSELF WITH A GARDEN AND ALL ELSE THAT PERTAINS TO IT SCARCELY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF THE BOY'S MOUTH WHEN EVERYTHING WAS THERE THAT HE HAD WISHED FOR AFTER A WHILE THE COOK SAID TO HIM
BUT A BRANCH WHICH HE HAD FASTENED TO A WITHERED TREE WHICH THE WIND WAS BLOWING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND AS THEY HAD BEEN SITTING SUCH A LONG TIME THEIR EYES CLOSED WITH FATIGUE AND THEY FELL FAST ASLEEP
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
HANS TAKES THE KNIFE STICKS IT IN HIS SLEEVE AND GOES HOME GOOD EVENING MOTHER GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER TOOK HER NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU
AND I AM GLAD THAT I HAD PITY ON HIM BUT LET HIM GO IN PEACE AND BROUGHT HOME HIS ROYAL COAT AT THIS THE KING WAS OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AND MADE IT KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM
HE WAS DISMISSED WITH NO BETTER ANSWER IN HIS TROUBLE AND FEAR HE WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD AND TOOK THOUGHT HOW TO HELP HIMSELF OUT OF HIS TROUBLE NOW SOME DUCKS WERE SITTING TOGETHER QUIETLY BY A BROOK AND TAKING THEIR REST
ALL GONE WAS ALREADY ON THE POOR MOUSE'S LIPS
NOW THE QUEEN LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING OF ALL THE ODD NAMES THAT SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND SHE SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE LAND TO FIND OUT NEW ONES THE NEXT DAY THE LITTLE MAN CAME AND SHE BEGAN WITH TIMOTHY
THEREUPON HE TOOK THE DOG WITH THE GOLDEN COLLAR AND SAID
WITH ALL MY HEART GET UP BEHIND AND BE SURE YOU DO NOT FALL OFF TAKE CARE OF THIS HANDSOME COACH OF MINE NOR DIRTY MY PRETTY RED WHEELS SO FINE NOW MICE BE READY AND WHEELS RUN STEADY FOR WE ARE GOING A VISIT TO PAY
THEN SAID A STRAW I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS
SHE THREW THE PEAS DOWN AMONG THE ASHES BUT THE LITTLE MAIDEN RAN OUT AT THE BACK DOOR INTO THE GARDEN AND CRIED OUT HITHER HITHER THROUGH THE SKY TURTLE DOVES AND LINNETS FLY BLACKBIRD THRUSH AND CHAFFINCH GAY HITHER HITHER HASTE AWAY
IN WHICH NEITHER SUN NOR MOON COULD BE SEEN AND HAD HIS WIFE PUT INTO IT AND WALLED UP HERE SHE WAS TO STAY FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK AND DIE OF HUNGER
BE AT REST YOU SHALL HAVE A SON WITH THE POWER OF WISHING SO THAT WHATSOEVER IN THE WORLD HE WISHES FOR THAT SHALL HE HAVE THEN SHE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE JOYFUL TIDINGS
IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
THE TWO PLAYED TOGETHER AND LOVED EACH OTHER WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND THE OLD COOK WENT OUT HUNTING LIKE A NOBLEMAN THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM HOWEVER THAT THE KING'S SON MIGHT SOME DAY WISH TO BE WITH HIS FATHER AND THUS BRING HIM INTO GREAT PERIL
YOU NAUGHTY CHILDREN WHY HAVE YOU SLEPT SO LONG IN THE FOREST WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK AT ALL THE FATHER HOWEVER REJOICED FOR IT HAD CUT HIM TO THE HEART TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND ALONE
AND WHEN SHE WAS BURIED THE TWO WHITE DOVES WHICH HAD BROUGHT HER FOOD TO THE TOWER AND WERE ANGELS OF HEAVEN FOLLOWED HER BODY AND SEATED THEMSELVES ON HER GRAVE THE AGED KING ORDERED THE COOK TO BE TORN IN FOUR PIECES
BUT GOD SENT TWO ANGELS FROM HEAVEN IN THE SHAPE OF WHITE DOVES WHICH FLEW TO HER TWICE A DAY AND CARRIED HER FOOD UNTIL THE SEVEN YEARS WERE OVER THE COOK HOWEVER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL
WHERE HAVE YOU THE CALF HANS I SET IT ON MY HEAD AND IT KICKED MY FACE THAT WAS ILL DONE HANS
AND HE THRUST HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND BROUGHT FORTH THE PINK AND PLACED IT ON THE ROYAL TABLE AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THE KING HAD NEVER SEEN ONE TO EQUAL IT THEN THE SON SAID
MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
YOU MUST DO FOR YOURSELF WHATEVER IS TO BE DONE NOW
BUT WHEN THEY HAD BROKEN OPEN THE DOOR THEY FOUND NO ONE WITHIN AND AS THEY CAME BACK INTO THE HOUSE ASHPUTTEL WAS LYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID IN HER DIRTY FROCK BY THE ASHES AND HER DIM LITTLE LAMP WAS BURNING IN THE CHIMNEY FOR SHE HAD RUN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD THROUGH THE PIGEON HOUSE
THE LITTLE CALF ALWAYS REMAINED STANDING LIKE ONE WHICH WAS EATING AND THE COW HERD SAID IT WILL SOON RUN BY ITSELF JUST LOOK HOW IT EATS ALREADY AT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE THE HERD HOME AGAIN HE SAID TO THE CALF
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE HAZEL TREE AND CRIED OUT SHAKE SHAKE HAZEL TREE GOLD AND SILVER OVER ME THEN HER FRIEND THE BIRD FLEW OUT OF THE TREE AND BROUGHT A GOLD AND SILVER DRESS FOR HER AND SLIPPERS OF SPANGLED SILK AND SHE PUT THEM ON AND FOLLOWED HER SISTERS TO THE FEAST
THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE CHILDREN WERE AWAKE SHE WAS ALREADY UP AND WHEN SHE SAW BOTH OF THEM SLEEPING AND LOOKING SO PRETTY
AND SHOWED THEM THE WAY THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND BY BREAK OF DAY CAME ONCE MORE TO THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE WOMAN OPENED IT AND SAW THAT IT WAS HANSEL AND GRETEL SHE SAID
HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING I WANT SOMETHING GIVEN ME GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A PIECE OF BACON GOODBYE GRETEL GOODBYE HANS
AND THESE THE DOG WAS COMPELLED TO DEVOUR BEFORE THE SIGHT OF ALL UNTIL FLAMES BURST FORTH FROM ITS THROAT ON THIS THE HUNTSMAN ASKED THE KING IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DOG IN HIS TRUE SHAPE
FOR SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF SHE SHOULD SO HAVE LIKED TO HAVE GONE WITH THEM TO THE BALL AND AT LAST SHE BEGGED HER MOTHER VERY HARD TO LET HER GO YOU ASHPUTTEL SAID SHE YOU WHO HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR NO CLOTHES AT ALL
YOU CANNOT GO YOU HAVE NO CLOTHES AND CANNOT DANCE AND YOU WOULD ONLY PUT US TO SHAME AND OFF SHE WENT WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS TO THE BALL NOW WHEN ALL WERE GONE AND NOBODY LEFT AT HOME ASHPUTTEL WENT SORROWFULLY
AND WANTED TO PUNISH HIS WICKED SONS BUT THEY MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND GOT INTO A SHIP AND SAILED AWAY OVER THE WIDE SEA AND WHERE THEY WENT TO NOBODY KNEW AND NOBODY CARED
WHO IS NIBBLING AT MY LITTLE HOUSE THE CHILDREN ANSWERED THE WIND THE WIND THE HEAVEN BORN WIND AND WENT ON EATING WITHOUT DISTURBING THEMSELVES
AND ON HIS WAY HOME AS HE RODE THROUGH A GREEN COPSE A HAZEL TWIG BRUSHED AGAINST HIM AND ALMOST PUSHED OFF HIS HAT SO HE BROKE IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT AWAY AND WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE IT TO HIS DAUGHTER THEN SHE TOOK IT
THIRDLY HE SAYS THAT THERE IS SOME SALAD ON THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND WENT THERE AND FOUND THE SALAD
AND BROKE ALL HER GOODS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AH WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL MY HUSBAND SAY
TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY OFF WHILE THE NURSE LAUGHED AND THE BABY CROWED AND ALL THE COURT JEERED AT HIM FOR HAVING HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING AND SAID
GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING BUT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN GRETEL SAYS TO HANS I WILL GO WITH YOU HANS TAKES GRETEL TIES HER TO A ROPE LEADS HER TO THE RACK AND BINDS HER FAST THEN HANS GOES TO HIS MOTHER
AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
WITH MARK BEFORE THE LATTER COULD STRIKE A BLOW GRAPPLED WITH HIM AND HELD HIM FAST TILL HE WAS SECURED AND HIS ARMS TIED BEHIND HIM AND SO IT IS YOU MORGAN FENWOLF
THE DOOR OF THE HOSTEL OPENED AND A FAT JOLLY LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH A BALD HEAD AND BUSHY GREY BEARD AND CLAD IN A BROWN SERGE DOUBLET AND HOSE TO MATCH ISSUED FORTH BEARING A FOAMING JUG OF ALE AND A HORN CUP
I WISH SUCH ANOTHER CHANCE OF CAPTURING THE FIEND WOULD OCCUR TO ME AS THE WORDS WERE UTTERED THE DOOR OF A RECESS WAS THROWN SUDDENLY OPEN AND HERNE IN HIS WILD GARB WITH HIS ANTLERED HELM UPON HIS BROW AND THE RUSTY CHAIN DEPENDING FROM HIS LEFT ARM STOOD BEFORE THEM
SAVE THAT OF THE FRENZIED RIDER BURSTING THROUGH THEM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FOREST WYAT HELD ON A DIRECT COURSE HIS BRAIN WAS ON FIRE AND THE FURY OF HIS CAREER INCREASED HIS FEARFUL EXCITEMENT
HEAVING A DEEP SIGH HE THEN AROSE AND PACED THE CHAMBER WITH RAPID STRIDES YES IT IS BETTER THUS HE EJACULATED IF I REMAIN NEAR HER I SHALL DO SOME DESPERATE DEED BETTER
NOTHING MATERIAL PASSED BETWEEN THEM AS LONG AS THE OFFICER REMAINED IN THE CHAMBER BUT ON HIS DEPARTURE SURREY OBSERVED LAUGHINGLY TO HIS FRIEND AND HOW DOTH MY FAIR COUSIN THE LADY ANNE BOLEYN
IN A STATE OF AGITATION WHOLLY INDESCRIBABLE WYAT STAGGERED TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE TERRACE IT MIGHT BE WITH THE DESIGN OF FLINGING HIMSELF FROM IT BUT WHEN WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THE LOW PARAPET WALL DEFENDING ITS PRECIPITOUS SIDE
I WOULD NOT BE IN THY SKIN MAT BEE FOR A TRIFLE THE KING WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY AND THEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PENETRATE THROUGH THE DEVICES OF THE EVIL ONE INTERRUPTED MAT I COULD HAVE SWORN IT WAS THE ROYAL SIGNET FOR I SAW IT ON THE KING'S FINGER AS HE DELIVERED THE ORDER
WITHOUT THE VESTIGE OF A CLOUD UPON HER BROW OR A CARE ON HER COUNTENANCE WITH INCREASED BITTERNESS OF HEART HE TURNED FROM THE SIGHT AND SHROUDED HIMSELF BENEATH THE GATEWAY OF THE NORMAN TOWER
DURING WHICH HE INTENTLY SCRUTINISED THE KNIGHT'S COUNTENANCE I WILL ASSIST YOU IN IT BE RULED BY ME AND YOU SHALL HAVE A DEEP AND FULL REVENGE
GIVE THE KNAVE A CUP OF ALE AND LET HIM WASH DOWN HIS FOUL WORDS IN A HEALTH TO THE KING WISHING HIM A SPEEDY DIVORCE AND A NEW QUEEN
NOTHING THAT MAY BRING WITH IT AFTER REPENTANCE DO NOT BE SWAYED BY THOSE WHO HAVE INFLAMED YOUR JEALOUSY AND WHO COULD PRACTISE UPON IT THINK THE MATTER CALMLY OVER AND THEN ACT
THEY ARE SPECIAL FAVOURITES OF THE KING'S HIGHNESS
AND SHE CARRIES HERSELF LIKE A WAFTER ON THE RIVER SAID THE BARGEMAN HER COMPLEXION IS AS GOOD AS IF I HAD GIVEN HER SOME OF MY SOVEREIGN BALSAM OF BEAUTY SAID DOMINGO LAMELYN MUCH BETTER OBSERVED JOUNGEVELLO THE MINSTREL
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK HAD GAINED THE PLATFORM
YOU DARE NOT BRAVE MY POWER AND YOU ARE RIGHT CRIED HERNE A WAVE OF MY HAND WOULD BRING THIS OLD TOWER ABOUT YOUR EARS A WORD WOULD SUMMON A LEGION OF FIENDS TO TORMENT YOU BUT DO NOT UTTER IT I PRAY YOU GOOD HERNE EXCELLENT HERNE CRIED MAT BEE
CROSSING HIMSELF DEVOUTLY SAINT DUNSTAN AND SAINT CHRISTOPHER SHIELD US FROM EVIL SPIRITS A TRUCE TO YOUR IDLE TERRORS ADAM SAID WYAT TAKE THESE PACKETS HE ADDED GIVING HIM HENRY'S DESPATCHES AND GUARD THEM AS YOU WOULD YOUR LIFE
I NOW BELIEVE ALL I HAVE HEARD OF YOU WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIM ASKED SURREY ADVANCING THAT HE HAS DEALINGS WITH THE FIEND WITH HERNE THE HUNTER REPLIED MARK IF I AM HANGED FOR A TRAITOR
AND GET FLOUTED FOR THY PAINS BY THE LADY ANNE SAID KIT COO THE DAMSEL IS NOT SO COMELY AS I EXPECTED TO FIND HER OBSERVED AMICE LOVEKYN ONE OF THE SERVING WOMEN TO HECTOR CUTBEARD THE CLERK OF THE KITCHEN
HOW MABEL WAS RECEIVED BY THE PARTY IN THE KITCHEN AND OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE TWO JESTERS ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A STOUT BUILT YEOMAN OF THE GUARD WHO WAS STANDING WITHIN THE DOORWAY NICHOLAS CLAMP DEMANDED ADMITTANCE TO THE KITCHEN
HE IS HERE HE IS COME CRIED MABEL IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST TERROR WHO
BETTER I SHOULD PERISH AT THE STAKE BETTER YOU SHOULD SUFFER THE MOST IGNOMINIOUS DEATH THAN THIS SHOULD BE DO YOU ACCEPT THEM CRIED HERNE DISREGARDING HER SUPPLICATIONS TRISTRAM ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE RECALL YOUR WORDS GRANDFATHER RECALL YOUR WORDS CRIED MABEL
PROCEEDED TO THE TERRACE AT THE NORTH OF THE CASTLE WHERE HE WAS CHALLENGED BY A SENTINEL BUT WAS SUFFERED TO PASS ON ON GIVING THE WATCH WORD THE NIGHT WAS PROFOUNDLY DARK
AND THAT NO TIME MIGHT BE LOST THE DUKE PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO THE ROYAL CLOSET WHERE HE FOUND THE KING PACING MOODILY TO AND FRO YOUR MAJESTY SEEMS DISTURBED SAID THE DUKE DISTURBED AY EXCLAIMED THE KING
AND I TRUST IT WILL FIND EQUAL FAVOUR IN YOUR EYES NOW THAT IT IS YOUR OWN BY HOLY MARY A ROYAL GIFT CRIED HENRY RISE YOU ARE NOT THE GRASPING SELFISH PERSON YOU HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED
YOU ARE ARRIVED AT THAT PITCH OF DESPERATION WHEN LIFE ITSELF BECOMES INDIFFERENT AND WHEN BUT ONE OBJECT REMAINS TO BE GAINED AND THAT IS VENGEANCE INTERRUPTED WYAT FIERCELY RIGHT CARDINAL RIGHT
CAME TO A LOW STRONG DOOR WHICH THEY UNLOCKED AND OBTAINED ADMISSION TO A LARGE OCTANGULAR CHAMBER WITH A VAULTED ROOF AND DEEP EMBRASURES TERMINATED BY NARROW LOOPHOLES
AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH TO TAKE THE OFFENDER TO THE CURFEW TOWER ACCORDINGLY THEY CROSSED THE LOWER WARD AND PASSING BENEATH AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE SEMICIRCULAR RANGE OF HABITATIONS ALLOTTED TO THE PETTY CANONS
TUT TUT EXCLAIMED THE KING WHO WAS NEVERTHELESS MOVED BY THE ARTFUL APPEAL THE GIFTS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM FOREIGN PRINCES PURSUED WOLSEY SEEING THE EFFECT HE HAD PRODUCED
HIS JESTER HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE DISCOVERY JUST MADE OF THE SECRET HOARD AND HE WAS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THIS DESPERATE MOVE BUT I WAS APPRIZED OF HIS INTENTIONS BY WILL SOMMERS AND HAVE COME IN TIME TO FOIL HIM
SAID HENRY AND I WILL CURB MY IMPULSES OF RAGE AND JEALOUSY TO MORROW BEFORE I SEE EITHER THE QUEEN OR ANNE WE WILL RIDE FORTH INTO THE FOREST AND TALK THE MATTER FURTHER OVER YOUR HIGHNESS HAS COME TO A WISE DETERMINATION SAID THE DUKE
A TALL MAN ENVELOPED IN A CLOAK AND WEARING A HIGH CONICAL CAP PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE ARQUEBUSIER STATIONED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE DUNGEON AND DESIRED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE PRISONERS I HAVE THE KING'S SIGNET HE SAID HOLDING FORTH THE RING
AND IN GOOD SOOTH I AM GLAD TO BE ALONE AMID THE DISTRACTIONS OF THE COURT I COULD FIND LITTLE LEISURE FOR THE MUSE YOUR SITUATION IS IN MANY RESPECTS ENVIABLE SURREY REPLIED WYAT
YOUR ROYAL MASTER WILL AS VAINLY SEEK TO CONTEND WITH ME AS HE DID TO BURY ME BENEATH THE OAK TREE CRIED HERNE IF YOU WANT ME FURTHER SEEK ME IN THE UPPER CHAMBER AND WITH THESE WORDS HE DARTED UP THE LADDER LIKE FLIGHT OF STEPS AND DISAPPEARED
STIMULATED BY CURIOSITY THE WHOLE OF THE PARTY ROSE FROM THE TABLE SIMON QUANDEN GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR THE OTHER COOKS LEFT THEIR JOINTS TO SCORCH AT THE FIRE THE SCULLIONS SUSPENDED THEIR WORK AND HOB AND NOB FIXED THEIR LARGE INQUIRING BLACK EYES UPON THE JESTER
AND I WILL ADD TO IT A WISH THAT THE POPE MAY FORGE HER MARRIAGE CHAINS TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND FASTER THAN EVER A FOOLISH WISH CRIED BRYAN WHY MARK YOU ARE CLEAN CRAZED
BOWED WITH AN AIR OF MOCK CEREMONY AND SAID IN AN AFFECTED TONE WELCOME FAIR MISTRESS TO THE KING'S KITCHEN WE ARE ALL RIGHT GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE WE NOT MATES AY THAT WE ARE REPLIED A CHORUS OF VOICES
AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT ADMIT WOLSEY TO YOUR SECRET COUNSELS YOU ARE HIS ENEMY SUFFOLK SAID THE KING STERNLY I AM YOUR MAJESTY'S FRIEND REPLIED THE DUKE I BESEECH YOU YIELD TO ME ON THIS OCCASION
BY MY TROTH THE WENCH IS WONDROUSLY BEAUTIFUL SAID KIT COO ONE OF THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD NO WONDER THE KING IS SMITTEN WITH HER SAID LAUNCELOT RUTTER THE BLADESMITH HER EYES SHINE LIKE A DAGGER'S POINT
THAT WELL NIGH BROKE HIS JAW AND SENT HIM REELING TO THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER HE HAD NOT AT FIRST UNDERSTOOD THAT HERNE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE UPPER ROOM BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS MADE AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE HE CRIED OUT AH DASTARDS HAVE YOU LET HIM BRAVE YOU THUS BUT I AM GLAD OF IT
TRAVERSED THE SPACE BEFORE THE WEST END OF SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL AND DESCENDING A SHORT FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AT THE LEFT AND THREADING A NARROW PASSAGE PRESENTLY ARRIVED AT THE ARCHED ENTRANCE IN THE CURFEW
BUT THEY HOWLED SO PITEOUSLY THAT I WAS FORCED TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN IT WOULD HAVE DONE YOUR HEART GOOD TO WITNESS THEIR MEETING AND TO SEE HOW THEY LEAPED AND ROLLED WITH DELIGHT HERE HOB HE ADDED TAKING A CAKE FROM HIS APRON POCKET DIVIDE THIS WITH THY BROTHER
AND ALL THESE HAVE BEEN LED BY DASTARDS O'ER THE WAY OUR FEET MUST TREAD
FATHER SAID ALI THE HALL SUN SAITH THOU ART WISE IN WAR NOW TELL US SHALL WE HOLD THE HALL AGAINST THE ROMANS THAT YE MAY FIND US THERE
YET HAD HE THRONG PLOUGH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE MUTTERED IN HIS BEARD AS HE WENT SMITE BEFORE SMITE BEHIND AND SMITE ON THE RIGHT HAND BUT NEVER ON THE LEFT
BELIKE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE THE HALL AND LET THE WOOD COVER US
BUT AS THEY RODE AMIDST THE CLEAR WATER WOLFKETTLE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SANG WHITE HORSE WITH WHAT ARE YE LADEN AS YE WADE THE SHALLOWS WARM BUT WITH TIDINGS OF THE BATTLE AND THE FEAR OF THE FATEFUL STORM
BUT WENT ON SMITING TILL THEY WERE FELLED WITH MANY STROKES HOWBEIT THE ARRAY OF THE GOTHS WAS BROKEN AND MANY WERE SLAIN AND PERFORCE THEY MUST GIVE BACK AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD BE DRIVEN INTO THE RIVER AND ALL BE LOST
SUCH THEN WAS THE BATTLE IN MIRKWOOD GIVE ME THE MEAD HORN THAT I MAY DRINK TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD AND THE DEEDS OF THE LIVING THAT ARE TO BE SO THEY BROUGHT HIM THE HORN
NOR TO HEED ANYTHING BUT THE TRAIL OF THE FOEMEN THROUGH THE SOUTH EASTERN HEATHS OF MIRKWOOD WHETHER OTHER ROMANS FOLLOW HIM OR NOT WHATEVER HAPPENS LET HIM LEAD THE GOTHS BY THAT ROAD
IT BEARS THE STORMY DRIFT NOR BOWS TO THE LIGHTENING FLASHING ADOWN FROM THE CLOUDY LIFT I SEE THE HAIL OF BATTLE AND THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE STRONG AND THEY GO ADOWN TO THE FOLK MOTE
THEN SWEINBIORN TOSSED UP HIS SWORD INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT IT BY THE HILTS AS IT FELL AND CRIED OUT ON ON TO THE MEADOW WHERE THESE THIEVES ABIDE US
HE HATH SEEN HIS SPEECH FRIEND GO HIS HEART HATH CONCEIVED A JOYANCE AND HATH BROUGHT IT UNTO BIRTH BUT HE HATH NOT CARRIED WITH HIM HIS SORROW OR HIS MIRTH HE HATH LIVED
AND ONE SAID ART THOU VERILY ALIVE OR A MAN COME BACK FROM THE DEAD WE SAW THEE FALL AS THOU WENTEST LEADING US AGAINST THE FOE AS IF THOU HADST BEEN SMITTEN BY A THUNDER BOLT AND WE DEEMED THEE DEAD OR GRIEVOUSLY HURT
CAME UP AND SPAKE WARRIORS
SAID AN OLD WARRIOR IF THAT BE SO THIODOLF WILT THOU BLENCH TWICE IS NOT ONCE ENOUGH NOW LET US GO BACK TO THE HARD HANDPLAY AND IF THOU WILT SMITE THYSELF AFTER THE BATTLE WHEN WE HAVE ONCE MORE HAD A MAN'S HELP OF THEE
THAT THE HALL SUN WOULD SPEAK AGAIN AND THAT GREAT TIDINGS WERE TOWARD
AND THEY LAUGHED FOR PRIDE AND ANGER THEN OTTER ANSWERED MEEKLY FOR HE WAS A WISE MAN AND A BOLD WE FLED NOT
WHAT DO YE SONS OF THE WAR SHIELD WHAT TALE IS THERE TO TELL IS THE KINDRED FALLEN TANGLED IN THE GRASP OF THE FALLOW HELL CROWS THE RED COCK OVER THE HOMESTEADS HAVE WE MET THE FOE TOO LATE
AND WHEN HE COMETH WE SHALL BOTH TOGETHER FALL UPON THE ROMANS EITHER IN CROSSING THE FORD OR IN THE WOLFING MEADOW BUT TELL HER ALSO THAT I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HINDER THE ROMANS FROM CROSSING
WHAT SAWEST THOU THEREIN O SWEINBIORN
NOW THEN DO WHAT THOU WILT THEREWITH HE TURNED ABOUT AND WENT HIS WAY AT ONCE RUNNING LIKE A COLT WHICH HAS NEVER FELT HALTER OR BIT
FOR BY THIS TIME HAD MANY MORE DRAWN NEAR TO HEARKEN WHAT WAS TOWARD THERE THEY SAT ON THEIR HORSES THE WHITE AND THE GREY AND WOLFKETTLE STOOD BY GEIRBALD'S BRIDLE REIN FOR HE HAD NOW LIGHTED DOWN AND A LITTLE BEHIND HIM HIS HEAD TOWERING OVER THE OTHERS
YEA FAIR IS OUR HALL'S ADORNING FOR A FEAST THAT IS STRANGE AND NEW
YET STILL FOUGHT THE WARRIORS OF THE KINDRED MOST VALIANTLY MAKING STAND AND FACING THE FOE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN KNOTS OF A SCORE OR TWO SCORE OR MAYBE TEN SCORE AND THOUGH MANY A MAN WAS SLAIN YET SCARCE ANY ONE BEFORE HE HAD SLAIN OR HURT A ROMAN
FELL ON WITH SUCH EXCEEDING FURY THAT THEY DROVE THE ROMANS WHO FACED THEM BACK ON THOSE WHO HAD SET ON THE WEDGE ARRAY WHICH ALSO STOOD FAST UNDISMAYED FOR HE WHO STOOD NEXT TO THIODOLF A MAN BIG OF BODY AND STOUT OF HEART
AND THE WORMINGS FOR THEY HAD OUT GONE THE OTHERS WHO WERE AFOOT IT MAY WELL BE THOUGHT HOW FEARFUL WAS THEIR ANGER WHEN THEY SET EYES ON THE SMOULDERING ASHES OF THE DWELLINGS
SEEK THOU THE TRAIL OF THE ALIENS OF THE CITIES OF THE SOUTH AND THOU SHALT FIND IT LEADING O'ER THE HEATHS TO THE BEECHEN WOOD AND THENCE TO THE STONY PLACES WHERE THE FOXES FIND THEIR FOOD
AND METHOUGHT ITS STAINING FAIR
THE FIRST TOLD HOW OTTER HAD BEEN COMPELLED IN A MANNER TO FALL ON THE ROMANS ALONG WITH THE RIDERS OF THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS AND THE SECOND WHO HAD BUT JUST THEN COME TOLD HOW THE MARKMEN HAD BEEN WORSTED BY THE ROMANS
HAD YE TIME TO LEARN ALL THIS OTTER WHEN YE FLED SO FAST BEFORE THE ROMANS THAT THE FATHER TARRIED NOT FOR THE SON NOR THE SON FOR THE FATHER HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE SO THAT MANY HEARD HIM
BETWIXT THE OPENINGS OF WHICH THE BRACKEN GREW EXCEEDING TALL WHEN VIGLUND WHO WAS VERY FINE EARED DEEMED THAT HE HEARD A HORSE COMING TO MEET THEM
THAT THIODOLF'S MEN HAD LET GO THEIR OCCASION FOR FALLING ON THE ROMANS WITH THEIR LINE SPREAD OUT SO THAT EVERY MAN MIGHT USE HIS WEAPONS YET WERE THE GOTHS STRONG BOTH IN VALIANCY AND IN NUMBERS NOR MIGHT THE ROMANS BREAK INTO THEIR ARRAY
NOR WERE THEY OTHERWISE THAN EXCEEDING GLAD
YET WERE MANY OF THE KINDRED ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED
A MANY AND A MANY AND DIVERS DEEDS THEY WIN IN THE FASHIONING OF STORIES FOR THE KINDREDS OF THE EARTH A GARLAND INTERWOVEN OF SORROW AND OF MIRTH TO THE WORLD A WARRIOR COMETH
SINCE SHE WAS SO WISE IN THE ANCIENT LORE BUT WHEN THEY SOUGHT FOR HER ON ALL SIDES SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND NOR COULD ANYONE REMEMBER SEEING HER DEPART FROM THE HALL BUT
SO NOW IS HE HASTENING TO FETCH A COMPASS AND FOLLOW THAT ROAD EITHER TO OVERTAKE THEM OR PREVENT THEM AND HE BIDDETH OTTER TARRY NOT BUT RIDE HARD ALONG THE WATER TO MEET THEM IF HE MAY
FOR ME AND MY HEART'S DELIVERANCE THAT HOUR WAS NEWLY WROUGHT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE HALLS OF MANHOOD I HAVE REACHED THE DOORS OF ELD AND I HAVE BEEN GLAD AND SORRY BUT EVER HAVE UPHELD
AND SO FELL SWOONING TO THE EARTH THOUGH NONE HAD SMITTEN HIM THEN STAYED WAS THE WEDGE ARRAY EVEN AT THE VERY POINT OF ONSET AND THE HEARTS OF THE GOTHS SANK FOR THEY DEEMED THAT THEIR LEADER WAS SLAIN
THE ROMANS MAY NOT COME AT THEM TO HURT THEM
BUT THERE WAS NO OTTER THERE AND MANY ANOTHER MAN WAS GONE
WAS THE MORE DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS
WITH THAT WORD SHE CAST HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASS BY THE MOUND SIDE AND WAS PRESENTLY ASLEEP FOR SHE WAS VERY WEARY BUT ALL THE TIME SHE HAD BEEN TELLING HER TALE
AND EVERY MAN HANDLED HIS WEAPONS BUT THAT MAN UNDERSTOOD AND SET THE LITTLE END TO HIS MOUTH AND LOUD ROARED THE HORN OF THE MARKMEN AND NEITHER FRIEND NOR FOE MISDOUBTED THE TALE THEREOF THEN LEAPED EVERY MAN TO HIS FEET
HIS BROW CLEARED AND THE ANXIOUS LINES IN THE FACE OF THE OLD MAN SMOOTHED THEMSELVES OUT AND AS HE RODE ALONG THE SOUL SO STIRRED WITHIN HIM THAT HE SANG OUT ALOUD
HERE SUNDER OUR WAYS FAREWELL FAREWELL SAID HE AND THOU VIGLUND TAKE THIS WORD IN PARTING THAT BELIKE THOU SHALT YET SEE THE ROMANS
AS IF IT WERE PAINTED WITH CINNABAR SAID OTTER ART THOU GOING BACK TO WOLFSTEAD SON YEA AT ONCE MY FATHER SAID ALI THEN TELL HER SAID OTTER
AND WILL TRY IF THE HOARY ELDERS MAY YET OUTLIVE THE WAY THAT LEADS TO THE SOUTHLAND CITIES TILL AT LAST THEY COME TO STAND WITH THE YOUNGLINGS IN THE MARKET TO BE SOLD IN AN ALIEN LAND
AND HAVING DESCENDED IN MY DIVING BELL AND PROPERLY SECURED THE HULL WITH ENORMOUS CABLES I ASCENDED TO THE SURFACE AND FASTENED MY CABLES TO THE BALLOON PRODIGIOUS MULTITUDES WERE ASSEMBLED TO BEHOLD THE ELEVATION OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
WHAT ARE THESE BODILESS SOUNDS AND VIBRATION TO ME AND YET WHAT AN EXQUISITE SWEETNESS IN THE SONGS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR ISLAND
AND THE OTHER EXTREMITY SEEMED TO STOOP INTO GREAT BRITAIN A MOST NOBLE BRIDGE INDEED AND A PIECE OF MASONRY THAT HAS OUTDONE SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN WONDERFUL MUST IT HAVE BEEN TO FORM SO TREMENDOUS AN ARCH ESPECIALLY AS THE ARTISTS HAD CERTAIN
AFTER WE HAD REPAIRED THE DAMAGES WE SUSTAINED IN THIS REMARKABLE STORM AND TAKEN LEAVE OF THE NEW GOVERNOR AND HIS LADY
THANKING ME FOR MY ASSISTANCE HOPED I WOULD NOT TROUBLE MYSELF ANY FARTHER AS HE WAS THEN HE PRESUMED OUT OF DANGER
HE PARRIED MY BLOWS
IN THE EMPIRE OF BROBDIGNAG FOR MY PART I ALWAYS TREATED THAT ACCOUNT AS FABULOUS HOWEVER TO OBLIGE HIM FOR HE HAD MADE ME HIS HEIR I UNDERTOOK IT AND SAILED FOR THE SOUTH SEAS WHERE WE ARRIVED WITHOUT MEETING WITH ANYTHING REMARKABLE
SAID LADY MOOSHILGAROUSTI TO LORD DARNARLAGANL
HIGH TOPPED WITH AIRY BLADDERS BY A STRING DEPENDENT HAD NOT STORMED AGAINST HIS LORDSHIP
AND TRUMP'TS HIGH CHIMING ANTHROPHOG
SHE FLEW TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT NORTH EAST WEST AND SOUTH BUT FOUND ON EVERY SIDE THE COMPANY PREPARED UPON THEIR NETS AT LENGTH SHE FLEW RIGHT UP SOARING AT A MOST ASTONISHING RATE TOWARDS THE SUN
AND THROWING THEM AGAINST THE FORTRESS DEMOLISHED THE STRONGEST RAMPARTS OF THE PLACE I TOOK MY MARK SO DIRECT
AND WERE CONTINUALLY CHIRPING AT A MOST INFERNAL RATE LOUD IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BODIES THE WHEELS OF THE CHARIOT CONSISTED OF UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND SPRINGS FORMED SO AS TO GIVE THE GREATER IMPETUOSITY TO THE VEHICLE
FLOATING IN THE AIR LIKE SO MANY SPIDERS UPON THEIR COBWEBS
AND IN A FEW MINUTES APPEARED FLOATING AMONG THE CLOUDS IT WAS THEN THE OPINION OF MANY PHILOSOPHERS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET HER DOWN THEN IT HAD BEEN TO DRAW HER UP
WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
AND WHICH HAD OCCASIONED SUCH ALARMS FOR THAT SPACE OF TIME IN THE WORLD ABOVE HOWEVER MY ARRIVAL RESTORED PEACE TO THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND VULCAN HIMSELF DID ME THE HONOUR OF APPLYING PLASTERS TO MY WOUNDS WHICH HEALED THEM IMMEDIATELY
IN SHORT THE WHOLE NATION WENT HEARTILY TO THE BUSINESS TO BUILD AN EDIFICE SUCH AS WAS NEVER SEEN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY I TOOK CARE TO SUPPLY THEM WITH THEIR FAVOURITE KAVA AND FUDGE AND THEY WORKED LIKE HORSES THE TOWER OF BABYLON WHICH
AND ADDED SHE RISING WITH ALL THE MAJESTY OF THE CZARINA EMPRESS OF HALF THE WORLD BE IT KNOWN TO ALL SUBJECTS THAT WE ORDAIN THESE CONDITIONS FOR SUCH IS OUR ROYAL WILL AND PLEASURE
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE THE BARON'S RETINUE IS OPPOSED IN A HEROIC STYLE BY DON QUIXOTE WHO IN HIS TURN IS ATTACKED BY GOG AND MAGOG LORD WHITTINGTON WITH THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW COMES TO THE ASSISTANCE OF DON QUIXOTE
AND THEN APPLYING HIS LIPS TO THE INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO SOUND IT LIKE A TRUMPET TWAS MARTIAL BEYOND DESCRIPTION
WHEN WE BEGAN TO OBSERVE AN AMAZING CHANGE IN EVERYTHING ABOUT US OUR SPIRITS BECAME LIGHT OUR NOSES WERE REGALED WITH THE MOST AROMATIC EFFLUVIA IMAGINABLE THE SEA HAD ALSO CHANGED ITS COMPLEXION AND FROM GREEN BECAME WHITE
AND FROM HALF THE TROOP THEIR EYES DEVOURING TORE NOR COULD THE RIDERS CRICKETS THRONED SUBLIME ESCAPE FROM RAGE FROM FURY LESS AVERSE THAN CANNONS MURDER O'ER THE STORMY SEA
AT THAT MOMENT SHE DROPPED HER NOSEGAY AH
AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
AND OPENING HIS MOUTH TO GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND I TOOK AIM AND DROVE MY BALL PRECISELY DOWN HIS THROAT TIPPOO FEARING THAT ALL WOULD BE LOST THAT A GENERAL AND SUCCESSFUL STORM WOULD ENSUE IF I CONTINUED TO BATTER THE PLACE
SELL OR SUFFER TO BE SOLD ANY PART OR QUANTITY WHATEVER OF THE SAID MATERIAL UNTIL IT BE AGREEABLE UNTO OUR GOOD WILL AND PLEASURE DATED IN OUR CASTLE OF GRISTARISKA
AND THE PARLIAMENT PRESENTED A PETITION PRAYING THAT I WOULD BE PLEASED TO TAKE THE STATE OF THE NATION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND GIVE ORDERS TO SATISFY THE PEOPLE OR THE MOST DREADFUL CONSEQUENCES WERE TO BE APPREHENDED TO THESE REQUESTS
AND AS SOON AS I BEGAN TO FILL MY BALLOON WITH INFLAMMABLE AIR THE VESSEL EVIDENTLY BEGAN TO MOVE BUT WHEN MY BALLOON WAS COMPLETELY FILLED SHE CARRIED UP THE ROYAL GEORGE WITH THE GREATEST RAPIDITY
AS WE HAVE BEEN BELIEVED WHOSE ADVENTURES ARE TENFOLD MORE WONDERFUL SO DO WE HOPE ALL TRUE BELIEVERS WILL GIVE HIM THEIR FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE
MONUMENT DE GRANDS HOMMES A CHRISTIAN CHURCH THAT THESE SARACENS HAD PERVERTED INTO ABOMINATION I BURST OPEN THE DOORS AND ENTERED SWORD IN HAND
WHILE THE COMPANY ON EVERY SIDE SET UP ONE GENERAL ACCLAMATION BUT GOG IN HIS BALLOON SOON STOPPED WAUWAU IN THE MIDST OF HER CAREER AND SNARED HER IN A NET THE CORDS OF WHICH HE CONTINUED TO HOLD IN HIS HAND
AND WERE MORE COMPLEX THAN A DOZEN CLOCKS LIKE THAT OF STRASBURGH
AND APPLAUSE FINDING HOW MUCH THEY LIKED THIS FUDGE I PROCURED ANOTHER QUANTITY FROM ENGLAND MUCH GREATER THAN THE FORMER AND CAUTIOUSLY BESTOWED IT OVER ALL THE KINGDOM THUS WERE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE REGAINED
AS IF ON EARTH HE HAD NOT WORK SUFFICIENT TO DISTRESS YOUR POTENT SERVITUDES BUT HE SHOULD ALSO SEEK IN HEAVEN DIRE CAUSE OF LABOUR RECOLLECT MY FRIENDS
AND THE GLORY OF EUROPE IS EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER HE SPAKE AND SUDDEN GOOD LORD WHITTINGTON AT HEAD OF ALL HIS RAREE SHOW
AND A VAST PROCESSION OF FISHWOMEN ADVANCING AGAINST ME I DEPOSITED THEIR MAJESTIES IN A PLACE OF SAFETY AND WITH MY DRAWN SWORD ADVANCED AGAINST MY FOES THREE HUNDRED FISHWOMEN WITH BUSHES DRESSED WITH RIBBONS IN THEIR HANDS
THEY HAVE BUT ONE FINGER UPON EACH HAND WITH WHICH THEY PERFORM EVERYTHING IN AS PERFECT A MANNER AS WE DO WHO HAVE FOUR BESIDES THE THUMB THEIR HEADS ARE PLACED UNDER THEIR RIGHT ARM AND WHEN ARE GOING TO TRAVEL OR ABOUT ANY VIOLENT EXERCISE THEY GENERALLY LEAVE THEM AT HOME
ARRIVING IN ENGLAND INSTANTLY DARTED THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT HALL AND PERCHED UPON THE CANOPY IN THE CENTRE TO THE ADMIRATION OF ALL PRESENT HER CACKLING APPEARED QUITE PROPHETIC AND ORACULAR
I TOOK SOME REFRESHMENT AND WENT TO REST THE DUTCH ARE A VERY RUDE SORT OF PEOPLE I RELATED THE ETNA PASSAGE TO THE OFFICERS EXACTLY AS I HAVE DONE TO YOU AND SOME OF THEM PARTICULARLY THE CAPTAIN SEEMED BY HIS GRIMACE AND HALF SENTENCE TO DOUBT MY VERACITY
ONE ALL MEAGRE MERE SKIN AND BONE AND CADAVEROUS SEEMED DEATH THAT HIDEOUS SKELETON IT WAS VOLTAIRE AND IN HIS HAND WERE A LYRE AND A DAGGER ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS ROUSSEAU WITH A CHALICE OF SWEET POISON IN HIS HAND
IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE WHOLE BECAME ONE GREAT INSTRUMENT OF WAR TO CORRESPOND WITH THIS COLOSSUS TOOK GUILDHALL AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND TURNING THE FOUNDATIONS TOWARDS THE HEAVENS
WHICH UPON BEING PRESSED YIELDED NOTHING BUT MILK WE SAW THE INHABITANTS RUNNING RACES UPON THE SURFACE OF THE MILK THEY WERE UPRIGHT COMELY FIGURES NINE FEET HIGH HAVE THREE LEGS AND BUT ONE ARM UPON THE WHOLE THEIR FORM WAS GRACEFUL
THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE FISHWOMEN CONTINUED TO INVOKE THEIR GREAT VOLTAIRE AND ALL THEIR MASTERS IN THIS MONUMENT DE GRANDS HOMMES IMPLORING THEM TO COME DOWN AND SUCCOUR THEM AGAINST THE ARISTOCRATS AND THE SWORD OF MUNCHAUSEN
AND A PRODIGIOUS CROWD OF NOBILITY AND PLACED SITTING UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE WHALE'S BONES AT THE PALACE AND HAVING REMAINED IN THIS SITUATION FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS AS A TRIAL ORDEAL
I SOON FOUND MYSELF IN A WARM BERTH AND MY BODY BRUISED AND BURNT IN VARIOUS PARTS BY THE RED HOT CINDERS WHICH BY THEIR VIOLENT ASCENT OPPOSED MY DESCENT
AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
NOTHING EXCEPT MARRIAGE ANSWERED THE KING AND HE INVITED ALL THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG MEN HE COULD THINK OF TO THE PALACE
THE GNOME HAD GIVEN TO HIS HOPED FOR BRIDE THERE THEY FOUND SO MUCH TO AMUSE THEM THAT THE HOURS PASSED LIKE MINUTES VEILS GIRDLES AND NECKLACES WERE TRIED ON AND ADMIRED
HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
BUT WHEN HER MOTHER IN LAW SAW IT WAS A GIRL SHE WRUNG HER HANDS AND WEPT SAYING O MISERABLE MOTHER MISERABLE CHILD ALAS FOR YOU WHY WERE YOU NOT A BOY
BUT A BLOW FROM ONE END OF THIS STICK WILL KILL A MAN WHILE A TOUCH FROM THE OTHER END WILL BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE YOU WON'T EASILY FIND ANOTHER STICK LIKE THAT NO THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN LET ME JUST LOOK AT IT AND I WILL TELL YOU WHOSE IT OUGHT TO BE THE MEN WERE PLEASED
WHEN THE NEXT DAY CAME HOWEVER THE BRIDEGROOM'S FATHER INFORMED THE PRINCESS THAT BY THE LAW OF THE LAND THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WAS GOT READY FOR HER AND PRINCE RING HAD THE TWO OAKS PLANTED IN THE GARDEN JUST IN FRONT OF HER WINDOWS SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM CONSTANTLY HE OFTEN WENT TO VISIT THE WITCH
HERE HIDDEN FROM EVERYONE SHE SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND BEGAN TO THINK WHAT SHE SHOULD DO TO SAVE HER CHILD SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING AMONG THE WILLOWS AND AN OLD WOMAN APPEARED BEFORE HER
SHE'D BE THE ONE TO ENJOY ALL THESE FINE THINGS DO YOU TAKE FOR YOURSELF TWO HORSES TWO CAMELS AND TWO ELEPHANTS WITH ALL THEIR TRAPPINGS AND PRESENT THE REST TO HER
THEIR FORE PAWS TO HIM BUT HOW AM I TO HELP YOU ASKED THE LITTLE BROTHER ALMOST WEEPING I CAN KILL PEOPLE AND DESTROY TREES AND MOUNTAINS BUT I HAVE NO POWER OVER MEN AND THE TWO ELDER BROTHERS CAME UP
THE YOUNG MAN DID EXACTLY WHAT THE PRINCESS HAD TOLD HIM THE THREE CHIPS WHICH HE FLUNG INTO THE RIVER BECAME A BOAT AND AS HE STEERED ACROSS THE STREAM THE SERPENT PUT UP ITS HEAD AND HISSED LOUDLY
SHE CUT A VERY SMALL HOLE IN THE SIDE OF KOUMONGOE AND OUT GUSHED ENOUGH MILK TO FILL THE BOWL HERE IS THE MILK YOU WANTED SAID SHE GOING UP TO KOANE WHO WAS STILL SULKING IN HIS CORNER
AND HE HAD TO HIRE A NUMBER OF ARMED MEN TO DEFEND IT ON THE ROAD AGAINST THE ROBBERS AND HE WAS GLAD INDEED TO FIND HIMSELF BACK AGAIN IN WALI DAD'S HUT WELL NOW
NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
WHERE A BIG FIRE WAS BLAZING AND THE HORRID BLACK PITCH BOILING AND BUBBLING OVER THE SIDES HE LOOKED AND SHUDDERED BUT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE SO HE SHUT HIS EYES TO AVOID SEEING
ALL DAY LONG THE BOY STOOD AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OVER THE SEA BY WHICH THE PRINCESS MUST TRAVEL BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HER NOT EVEN THE TINIEST WHITE SAIL AND AS HE STOOD SOLDIERS CAME AND LAID HANDS ON HIM AND LED HIM UP TO THE CASK
WHO WAS WORKING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DO YOU SEE KOUMONGOE RUNNING FAST DOWN THE HILL THAT IS SOME MISCHIEF OF THE CHILDREN'S I AM SURE I MUST GO HOME AND FIND OUT WHAT IS THE MATTER AND THEY BOTH THREW DOWN THEIR HOES
AND GRATITUDE AND SHE STAYED AS LONG AS SHE DARED PLAYING WITH HER BABY AT LAST SHE FELT SHE MUST RETURN TO THE VILLAGE LEST SHE SHOULD BE MISSED AND THE CHILD WAS HANDED BACK TO THE OLD WOMAN
AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
AND THE MEN LAID DOWN THE COFFIN AND LAUGHED TOO TILL THEIR SIDES NEARLY SPLIT THE DEAD MAN WAS SO ASTONISHED AT THIS BEHAVIOUR THAT HE PEEPED OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW IN THE SIDE OF THE COFFIN AND CRIED OUT
HAD ALREADY ENTERED THE MOUNTAIN THE LITTLE BROTHER WAS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH PUZZLED AT NOT SEEING ANYTHING OF EITHER OF THE ANIMALS WHICH HAD VANISHED SUDDENLY OUT OF HIS SIGHT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT
WHY I WOULD GLADLY GIVE HER TWO THOUSAND CRIED HE FOR SHE HAS SAVED MY DAUGHTER AND HE BADE MESSENGERS HASTEN TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES AND TELL HIS PEOPLE TO SEND HIM AT ONCE ALL THE CATTLE HE POSSESSED WHEN THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED
AND HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AND HUNT FOR MORE BESIDES HE WISHED TO SEEK FOR HIS PARENTS THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT LIKE BEING LEFT ALONE IN THE HUT AND CRIED BITTERLY
WHICH MASILO HAD MANAGED TO REACH BEFORE HER ALL THE REST OF THE DAY HE SAT IN A CORNER WEEPING AND HIS MOTHER WHO CAME IN ASKED WHY ARE YOU WEEPING SO BITTERLY MY SON
LAY IN THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD STOOD NOT KNOWING QUITE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT ALL THE BOY CONTINUED ON THE TRAIL AND WENT DOWN THE RIGHT HAND FORK TILL HE CAME TO THE CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE BEARS USED TO HIDE
PANTING IN THEIR MIDST AND THE BOY VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED STOOD STILL LETTING HIS BOW FALL TO THE GROUND WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ALL MY SERVANTS ASKED THE CHIEF
WHEN ASMUND SAW ALL THESE WILD DOINGS FROM HIS TREE HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER KEEP SILENCE HE WENT TO PRINCE RING AND SAID
HOPED BY PUTTING IT OFF THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN BUT THE SISTERS WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN RATHER JEALOUS OF HELGA WERE SECRETLY PLEASED THAT THEIR BRIDEGROOMS SHOULD OUTSHINE HERS
MASILO TRIED TO LOOK SHOCKED BECAUSE HIS WIFE HAD BROKEN THE LAW BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS VERY GLAD BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW ASKED HE MAKE SURE FOR YOURSELF THAT I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH
WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER HABOGI LED UP A BEAUTIFUL HORSE FROM A FIELD WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT TO GRAZE AND BADE HELGA JUMP UP ON ITS SPLENDID SADDLE ALL EMBROIDERED IN SCARLET AND GOLD
AH THAT IS DELIGHTFUL WE WANT SOMETHING NEW ANSWERED THEY AND PLACED THE PRINCESS BETWEEN THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS OF THE FOX
THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
WHILE THE HEN WRIGGLED HERSELF FREE AS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD GAZED HIS FILL HE WENT OUT INTO THE COURTYARD AND PICKED UP HIS HEN WHO WAS SEEKING FOR CORN AS HE DREW NEAR THE GATE HE PAUSED WHY DID I NOT GIVE HER A KISS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
IT DOES NOT FEEL VERY WARM OBSERVED THE MAN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD BORNE ALL THIS PATIENTLY FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SO FINE ANSWERED SHE YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE AS THICK AS THE ROUGH CLOTHES YOU WEAR EVERY DAY
ALSO TWENTY CAMELS OF THE BEST BREED WHICH HAD THE SPEED OF RACE HORSES AND COULD SWING ALONG AT A TROT ALL DAY WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
DILAH THE REJECTED ONE DILAH WHOM HER FATHER MASILO CAST OUT AND IN A MOMENT THE OLD WOMAN APPEARED HOLDING THE BABY IN HER ARMS
TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND
AND IN AN INSTANT ALL THE TREES WILL BE ON THE GROUND BUT PICK UP THREE CHIPS OF THE TREE YOU FELLED AND PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET AND THE YOUNG MAN DID EXACTLY AS HE WAS BID AND SOON RETURNED WITH THE THREE CHIPS SAFE IN HIS COAT
WAS THAT YOU I HEARD WALKING ABOUT JUST NOW HE ASKED FOR WOLVERINES ARE CAUTIOUS ANIMALS AND ALWAYS LIKE TO KNOW THE REASONS OF THINGS NO
THOUGH SHE WAS VERY GOOD NATURED SHE WAS NOT VERY CLEVER AND SHE GOT SOME OF THE BITS WRONG WHEN THE WOLVERINE WHO WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS CLOTHES CAME TO PUT IT ON HE GREW VERY ANGRY
O MY LORD I HAVE LEFT NOTHING IN THE TREASURY JUDAR GAVE THE TREASURE TO HIS MOTHER BIDDING HER KEEP IT AND LAYING THE ENCHANTED SADDLE BAGS BEFORE HIM SAID TO THE JINNI I COMMAND THEE TO BUILD ME THIS NIGHT A LOFTY PALACE
FOR OUR SAKE HOWEVER THOU WILT GO THIS TIME AND CARRY OUR PRESENT AND OUR LETTER TO HIM OF SARANDIB AND INSHALLAH BY GOD'S LEAVE THOU SHALT RETURN QUICKLY
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED BUT WHEN I HAD BESTRIDDEN THE PLANK
SO THEY CRIED UPON THEIR SLAVES WHO BROUGHT FIREWOOD AND KINDLED A FIRE IN THE HEART OF THE PLAIN
THEN I WENT OUT IN HIS COMPANY WITHOUT TELLING ANY OF MY FAMILY
SO THE MOOR CARRIED HIM TO HIS LODGING AND ENTREATED HIM WITH HONOUR CLOTHING HIM IN A DRESS OF WHICH THE LIKE WAS NOT AND SAYING TO HIM
AND WILL NOT RETURN BUT WITH THE TREASURES OF THE PERSIANS WHEN AJIB HEARD THE STORY OF MARDAS HE CHANGED COLOUR TO YELLOW AND WAS IN ILL CASE AND MADE SURE OF HIS OWN DESTRUCTION THEN HE SAID O MARDAS IS THE YOUTH'S MOTHER WITH THEE OR WITH HIM AND MARDAS REPLIED
AND HE SOUGHT HER OF ME SO I REQUIRED OF HIM THE HEAD OF THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN WHEREFORE HE WENT TO HIM AND AFTER ENGAGING HIM IN SINGULAR COMBAT
AND SHE ANSWERED WITH THE GUESTS THEY REJOINED HAPLY HE WENT AWAY WITH THEM WHILST WE SLEPT O MOTHER IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE HAD TASTED OF STRANGERHOOD AND YEARNED TO GET AT HIDDEN HOARDS
SHE IS WITH ME IN MY TENTS QUOTH AJIB WHAT IS HER NAME QUOTH MARDAS HER NAME IS NUSRAH TIS VERY SHE REJOINED AJIB AND SENT FOR HER TO THE PRESENCE NOW WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE HIM HE LOOKED ON HER AND KNEW HER AND ASKED HER
AND THEY SAID TO HIM WE WILL TAKE THEE WITH US AND OPEN THE TREASURE TO THEE SHE ENQUIRED HATH HE THEN BEEN IN COMPANY WITH MOORS AND THEY REPLIED SAYING WERE THEY NOT OUR GUESTS YESTER NIGHT AND SHE
AND THEY FELL ON THE FOOD LIKE CANNIBALS THEN HE GAVE HIS MOTHER THE REST OF HIS GOLD SAYING IF MY BROTHERS COME TO THEE GIVE THEM WHEREWITHAL TO BUY FOOD AND EAT IN MY ABSENCE HE SLEPT WELL THAT NIGHT
GOD FREE THY NECK FROM THE FIRE AND DO THOU GRANT ME O MY MASTER THY GRACIOUS LEAVE TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY YES QUOTH HE THOU SHALT HAVE THAT PERMISSION
THE BUSINESS IS IN THY HANDS DO AS THOU WILT THEN ASKED HE WILT THOU SELL THE WOOD TO ME O MY SON FOR AN HUNDRED GOLD PIECES
AND WHEN THE ELEPHANTS APPEARED AND WANDERED ABOUT AMONG THE TREES I SHOT MY ARROWS AT THEM AND CONTINUED TILL I HAD SHOT DOWN ONE OF THEM IN THE EVENING I REPORTED MY SUCCESS TO MY MASTER WHO WAS DELIGHTED IN ME AND ENTREATED ME WITH HIGH HONOUR
SO LONG AS I ABODE ON HIS BACK I SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM PRONOUNCING THE TASBIH OR OTHERWISE GLORIFYING GOD THEN I GAVE THE WAND OF GOLD TO HIM WHOM I HAD DELIVERED FROM THE SERPENT AND BADE HIM FAREWELL AND MY FRIEND TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND FLEW WITH ME AS BEFORE
CARRY ME TO CAIRO THIS DAY AND HE REPLIED THY WILL BE DONE AND TAKING HIM ON HIS BACK FLEW WITH HIM FROM NOON TILL MIDNIGHT WHEN HE SET HIM DOWN IN THE COURTYARD OF HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE AND DISAPPEARED
SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM TO TAKE THIS BOOK SO WE ALL AGREED TO THIS CONDITION AND HE CONTINUED O MY SONS
AND TURNED TO FLY MAKING FOR THE TOWN BUT GHARIB CRIED OUT TO HIS TROOPS SAYING UP AND AFTER THE RUNAWAYS SO THE PERSIANS AND THE ARABS CRAVE AFTER THE KING OF BABEL AND HIS HOST AND CAUSED SWORD TO SMITE THEM TILL THEY SLEW OF THEM TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE
AND THEY FILLED THE WHOLE EARTHLY PLAIN AND THE CHAMPIONS TO COME OUT WERE FAIN NOW THE FIRST WHO SALLIED FORTH A CHAMPIONING TO THE FIELD WAS THE GHUL OF THE MOUNTAIN BEARING ON SHOULDER A TERRIBLE TREE AND HE CRIED OUT BETWEEN THE TWO HOSTS SAYING
AT ONCE PACKED HIM OFF TO SUEZ
AND ON THIS WISE WE SHALL BE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO THE SAID KING I REPLIED THAT I HEARD AND OBEYED BEING UNABLE TO OPPOSE HIS COMMAND
AND I WASHED MY HANDS AND HIS HANDMAIDS BROUGHT ME SILKEN NAPKINS WITH WHICH I DRIED THEM AND WIPED MY MOUTH ALSO THE SHAYKH SET APART FOR ME AN APARTMENT IN A PART OF HIS HOUSE
FOR I HAVE WEALTH GALORE THEN I RETURNED TO MY SENSES AND SAID
THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT HOWEVER AFTER A LITTLE THE RAFT GLIDED INTO OPEN AIR AND I SAW BEFORE ME A WIDE VALLEY WHEREINTO THE RIVER FELL WITH A NOISE LIKE THE ROLLING OF THUNDER
I MADE NO STAY THERE BUT FREIGHTED ANOTHER VESSEL AND TRANSFERRING MY GOODS TO HER SET OUT FORTHRIGHT FOR BAGHDAD CITY WHERE I ARRIVED IN SAFETY AND ENTERING MY QUARTER AND REPAIRING TO MY HOUSE FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND FAMILIARS
AND DROVE AT SA'ADAN THE GHUL SAYING WOE TO THEE O SA'ADAN WHEN THE GIANT HEARD THIS HE WAXED FURIOUS BEYOND MEASURE AND RAISING HIS TREE CLUB AIMED AT THE INFIDEL A BLOW THAT HUMMED THROUGH THE AIR THE AMALEKITE MET THE STROKE WITH HIS MACE
JUDAR WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER WHO ROSE WEEPING AND GREETED HIM FONDLY AND TOLD HIM HOW THE KING HAD BEATEN HIS BROTHERS
MOREOVER THE MERCHANTS INSTALLED ME IN HIS OFFICE FOR HE WAS THEIR SHAYKH AND THEIR CHIEF AND NONE OF THEM PURCHASED AUGHT BUT WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE AND BY HIS LEAVE AND NOW HIS RANK PASSED ON TO ME
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND TENTH NIGHT
THEY THREW ME OUT ROPES WHICH I HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO HOLD THEN THEY TOSSED A NET OVER THE CRAFT AND DREW IT ASHORE WITH ME WHEREUPON I FELL TO THE GROUND AMIDST THEM AS I WERE A DEAD MAN
I HAVE HAD ABUNDANT GOOD OF HIM AND HE HATH HEARTENED MY HEART AND ENTREATED ME WITH HONOUR WHEREFORE IT BEHOVETH ME TO WEEP FOR HIM
HE CONTINUED HIS TALE AS FOLLOWS SO YOUR FATHER RETURNED EMPTY HANDED
NAY ANSWERED THE MAGHRIBI
THE TEARS RAILED FROM HIS EYES IN RILLS AND HE LOOKED AT THE MESSENGER AND SAID WHAT IS THY NAME AND HE REPLIED MY NAME IS SABA AL KIFAR SAID GHARIB RETURN TO THY LORD AND TELL HIM THAT THE COMMANDER OF THIS HOST IS CALLED GHARIB
THAT I MIGHT DIVERT MYSELF WITH THE REST AND RETURN WITH YOU THIS MAY NOT BE ANSWERED HE BUT I CEASED NOT TO SOLICIT HIM AND I IMPORTUNED HIM TILL HE CONSENTED
WHEN THE BAKER AFTER SUMMING UP WHAT WAS DUE TO HIM SAID I STILL OWE THEE TWO DAYS BREAD REPLIED GOOD AND WENT ON TO THE BUTCHER TO WHOM HE GAVE A GOLD PIECE AND TOOK MEAT SAYING
GAVE ME MEAT AND DRINK AND CLOTHING AND TREATED ME IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER SO I WAS HEARTENED AND I RESTED A LITTLE
WHEREWITH THEY FLEW UNTO THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE FIRMAMENT AND NONE REMAINED IN THE CITY SAVE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND I SAID IN MY MIND WHEN THE FIRST OF THE MONTH COMETH I WILL ASK ONE OF THEM TO CARRY ME WITH THEM
I THEN ENTERED MY HOUSE AND MET MY FAMILY AND BRETHREN AND SUCH IS THE END OF THE HISTORY THAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING MY SEVEN VOYAGES PRAISE BE TO ALLAH THE ONE THE CREATOR THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH
WHO LAID UP MY GOODS IN MY WAREHOUSES WHEN MY PEOPLE WHO RECKONING THE PERIOD OF MY ABSENCE ON THIS MY SEVENTH VOYAGE HAD FOUND IT TO BE SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS AND HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF ME
SAY ME WILT THOU TAKE UP THINE ABODE IN THIS PALACE AND SHE ANSWERED I WILL O MY SON AND CALLED DOWN BLESSINGS UPON HIM THEN HE RUBBED THE RING AND BADE THE JINNI FETCH HIM FORTY HANDSOME WHITE HAND MAIDS
SO HE GAVE HIM THE TWENTY DUCATS
SO HE LOOKED OUT AND LISTENING HEARD ALL THE ANGRY WORDS THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
AND THOU SHALT STAND IN MY STEAD I WAS SILENT FOR SHAME AND MADE HIM NO ANSWER WHEREUPON HE CONTINUED DO MY DESIRE IN THIS O MY SON
WHOM SHE HAD SWALLOWED EVEN TO BELOW HIS NAVEL AND HE WAS CRYING OUT AND SAYING WHOSO DELIVERETH ME ALLAH WILL DELIVER HIM FROM ALL ADVERSITY SO I WENT UP TO THE SERPENT AND SMOTE HER ON THE HEAD WITH THE GOLDEN STAFF
THIS IS THE CURRENT PRICE OF THY GOODS IN HARD TIMES LIKE THESE WILT THOU SELL THEM FOR THIS OR SHALL I LAY THEM UP FOR THEE IN MY STOREHOUSES TILL SUCH TIME AS PRICES RISE O MY LORD ANSWERED I
BUT IN THE NIGHT SOFT MUSIC WAS HEARD STEALING CLOSE TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND EVERY MAN SLEPT AND THE MOTHER SLEPT ALSO WHEN THEY WOKE AGAIN IT WAS MORNING AND THE BABY WAS GONE HIGH AND LOW THEY LOOKED FOR IT
BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
THEY FORGOT IN THEIR FRIGHT WHAT THEY WERE THERE FOR AND FLED TO HIDE THEMSELVES AND THE NAKED MAN STOOD ALONE AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN VERY SOON A MAN CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND SPOKE TO HIM DO YOU KNOW ME
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY AFTER THAT A WOMAN BADE HER ENTER AND SET FOOD BEFORE HER AND GAVE HER A SOFT BED TO LIE IN AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE SHE GOT UP AND LEFT THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF THE HOODIE
BUT DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT FOR THE WOLF WAS QUITE A FRIENDLY ONE HE CERTAINLY JUMPED ON TO WALTER BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS COAT AND RUBBED HIS NOSE AGAINST HIS FACE
AND EVERYONE MEANT TO BE THERE EXCEPT THE STRANGER WHO HAD COME OVER THE HILL OF POISON EVERYONE THAT IS BUT THE COOK WHO WAS TO MAKE THE BRIDAL SUPPER GREATLY HE LOVED RACES AND SORE WAS HIS HEART TO THINK THAT ONE SHOULD BE RUN WITHOUT HIS SEEING IT
FULL OF WRATH HE RUSHED AT THE MICE BUT HE COULD NO MORE COME UP WITH THEM THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN GNATS OR BIRDS OF THE AIR SAVE ONE ONLY WHICH LINGERED BEHIND THE REST AND THIS MOUSE MANAWYDDAN CAME UP WITH
I SHOULD KNOW IF I SHOULD TAKE JONAS WITH ME I COULD MANAGE

BUT WHEN THE NEXT YEAR BEGAN THEY GREW WEARY WE CANNOT SPEND OUR LIVES THUS SAID MANAWYDDAN AT LAST LET US GO INTO ENGLAND AND LEARN SOME TRADE BY WHICH WE MAY LIVE SO THEY LEFT WALES AND WENT TO HEREFORD
JUMP SHE REPLIED BUT SOON THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND LIKE CRIES WHAT IS IT ASKED HOUARN BEGINNING TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST THE CRICKETS ON THE HEARTH SAID SHE AND BROKE INTO A SONG WHICH DROWNED THE CRIES FROM THE POT
WALTER CAN TAKE THE MILLER'S LITTLE LISA WITH HIM SHE CAN SIT ON A STONE AND LOOK ON SAID JONAS NO SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE FRIGHTENED SAID WALTER
AND I WILL TEACH THEE TO STITCH WE WILL BUY THE LEATHER READY DRESSED AND WILL MAKE THE SHOES FROM IT THEN STRAIGHTWAY HE SOUGHT THE TOWN FOR THE BEST LEATHER
AND THERE YOU CANNOT FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT HORSE SHOES ON YOUR HANDS AND FEET BUT I WILL HELP YOU PUT ON THIS SUIT OF MEN'S CLOTHES AND GO DOWN THIS ROAD TILL YOU COME TO THE SMITHY AND THERE YOU CAN LEARN TO MAKE HORSE SHOES FOR YOURSELF
BUT VERY SOON IT STRUCK HER AS ODD THAT AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROADS FULL OF PEOPLE THEY ALL LAUGHED AS THEY LOOKED AT HER HORSE AT LENGTH SHE CAUGHT SOME WORDS UTTERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER WHY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS SOLD HER HORSE'S TAIL AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
THEN JONAS BEGAN TO LAUGH YES HE LAUGHED SO THAT HE NEARLY BURST HIS SKIN BELT WELL WELL WAS THAT THE WOLF WAS THAT THE WOLF WHICH WALTER

BECAUSE FOR SEVEN YEARS NO MAN HATH VISITED THIS PLACE I WANDER WHERE I WILL ANSWERED THE SCHOLAR AND WHAT WORK ART THOU UPON I AM ABOUT TO HANG A THIEF THAT I CAUGHT ROBBING ME
AND HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE AND DESPERATE THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS DARED SPEAK TO HIM THE SAD LITTLE PROCESSION HAD PASSED SOME HOURS IN THIS MANNER WHEN NEAR THE GATE OF A MONASTERY AN OLD WOMAN APPEARED ROUND A CORNER
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE DWELT IN THE LAND OF ERIN A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS SEEKING A WIFE AND OF ALL THE MAIDENS ROUND ABOUT NONE PLEASED HIM AS WELL AS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF A FARMER
BARBAIK WAS FURIOUS
WAS TO TAKE BY THE NECK AND SHAKE AND THROW DOWN ON ITS BACK NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT STRUGGLED JUST LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER AT HIM HE IS YOUR OLD FRIEND YOUR OWN GOOD OLD CARO
IN ORDER TO GO AND COUNT HER CABBAGES
THE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET AFTER THE CEREMONY YOU GAVE HER THREE RINGS AND A CHARM WITH A CROSS ON IT AND THEN PUT HER IN A COTTAGE IN THE FOREST THINKING TO HIDE THE MATTER SECURELY FOR SOME MONTHS YOU VISITED THE COTTAGE EVERY WEEK
LIKE THEM I SHALL SEEK TILL I GET WHAT I WANT THAT IS MONEY TO BUY A COW AND A PIG TO FATTEN AND IF YOU LOVE ME BELLAH YOU WON'T ATTEMPT TO HINDER A PLAN WHICH WILL HASTEN OUR MARRIAGE THE GIRL SAW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE SO SHE ANSWERED SADLY
AND THE BELL TO TELL ME OF YOUR PERILS THE STICK I SHALL KEEP FOR MYSELF SO THAT I CAN FLY TO YOU IF EVER YOU HAVE NEED OF ME THEN THEY CRIED FOR A LITTLE ON EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND HOUARN STARTED FOR THE MOUNTAINS BUT IN THOSE DAYS AS IN THESE BEGGARS ABOUNDED
WALTER IMMEDIATELY REGAINED COURAGE IT WAS WELL I TOOK MY DRUM WITH ME HE THOUGHT AND WENT STRAIGHT ON WITH COURAGEOUS STEPS VERY SOON HE CAME QUITE CLOSE TO THE KILN
YOU CRIED TEPHANY STUPEFIED AT DISCOVERING THAT THE BEGGAR KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AFFAIRS BUT THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT HEAR HER
AND TURNING AWAY BURST INTO TEARS BUT WHAT WAS HER SURPRISE WHEN SHE SAW THAT EACH TEAR DROP WAS A ROUND AND SHINING PEARL BARBAIK WHO ALSO BEHELD THIS MARVEL UTTERED A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT AND THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES TO PICK THEM UP FROM THE FLOOR
AT THE FIRST NOTE OF MUSIC THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN THE FARMER ARRIVED IN THE MORNING TO SEE HIS GRANDSON HE FOUND THEM ALL WEEPING FOR WHILE THEY HAD SLEPT THE BABY HAD VANISHED WELL THE NEXT YEAR IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN
THE GIRL WAS SURPRISED AT HIS WORDS FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A HOODIE AT ALL TIMES STILL SHE SAID NOTHING OF THIS AND ONLY REPLIED I WOULD RATHER THOU WERT A MAN BY DAY AND A HOODIE BY NIGHT AND SO HE WAS
WHEN HE ENTERED THE HALL WHERE KIEVA WAS SITTING HE LIGHTED A FIRE AND HUNG THE GLOVE UP ON A PEG WHAT HAST THOU THERE ASKED SHE A THIEF HE ANSWERED THAT I CAUGHT ROBBING ME
IT TOOK SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE OLD WOMAN BUT AT LENGTH IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE WITH THE EQUERRY SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH ROYAL HONOURS AS BECAME THE BRIDE OF THE PRINCE
IN THE PRETTY HOUSE WHICH HAS WHITE WINDOW FRAMES A NEAT PORCH AND CLEAN STEPS WHICH ARE ALWAYS STREWN WITH FINELY CUT JUNIPER LEAVES WALTER'S PARENTS LIVE HIS BROTHER FREDERICK
WEAR HOLES IN HIS ELBOWS BREAK THE CROCKERY IN PIECES THROW BALLS THROUGH THE WINDOWPANES DRAW OLD MEN ON IMPORTANT PAPERS
AND HOW YOU ARE SEEKING IF IN ANY WISE YOU CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT THERE IS NONE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION SAVE ONLY I MYSELF IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO ALL I ASK AT HER WORDS THE PRISONER FELT AS IF A LOAD HAD ALL AT ONCE BEEN ROLLED OFF HIM
IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE AGAINST THE BROWNIE WHO HAD CAUSED HER TO EXPECT A LIFE OF EASE AND PLEASURE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT JEGU AND BEHELD HIS RED FACE SQUINTING EYES AND UNTIDY HAIR HER ANGER WAS DOUBLED
DOWN CARO HE SAID BOTH RELIEVED AND ANNOYED IT WAS ONLY A DOG THEN IF IT HAD BEEN A WOLF I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM IF WALTER WOULD LISTEN TO MY ADVICE
THEY BESOUGHT ME MUCH TO CHANGE THEM INTO MICE
SHE SAW THAT HE WAS VERY ILL SO PUT HIM TO BED AND TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIM THAT BY AND BYE HE WAS AS STRONG AS EVER IN GRATITUDE FOR HER GOODNESS TO HIM HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A WIZARD
FOR SHE HAD TO GO SOME WAY FORWARDS AND THEN THROW THE HORSE SHOES BACK FOR HIM TO PUT ON STILL AT LAST THEY WERE OVER AND THEY WENT BACK THE WAY SHE HAD COME AND STOPPED AT THE THREE HOUSES IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR LITTLE SONS TO THEIR OWN HOME
AND HUTS FOR THE PEOPLE TO DWELL IN AND HE WAS SATISFIED IN HIS SOUL
AND USE IN THEIR VERBS SEVERAL QUAINT VARIATIONS OF TENSE BUT WHAT A SYNTACTICAL DIGRESSION OH BOY THE WOUND AT MY HEART IS SO DEEP AND SO SORE THAT I DREAD THE DRESSINGS EVEN BY YOUR DELICATE TOUCH WHERE WAS I
WELL TO CONTINUE MY REPORT THE VOICE GAVE US SOME TROUBLE AS YOU FORESAW AND THE WHOLE PLAN HUNG IN THE BALANCE DURING A FEW AWFUL MOMENTS FOR THOUGH HE EASILY ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION WE HAD PLANNED HE SENT ME OUT AND TOLD DOCTOR MACKENZIE
YOU CAN HAVE NO CONCEPTION HOW OFTEN AWKWARD MOMENTS AROSE AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE LIBRARY THE FIRST TIME GARTH CAME DOWNSTAIRS WHEN HE ORDERED SIMPSON TO BRING THE STEPS FOR MISS GRAY
NOW THE DUCHESS HAS DONE COME ON MIND THE BOTTOM STEP HANG IT ALL HOW DARK IT IS BEHIND THIS CURTAIN GARTH GAVE HER HIS HAND AND JANE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED IN THE OVERDENE CONCERT ROOM
I FEAR THE DESERT WOULD HAVE TO OPEN ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOW HER UP WE MUST AVERT SUCH A CATASTROPHE
HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BRING OUT A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE LETTER WRITER DO YOU REMEMBER THE CONDOLENCES OF MISSUS PARKER BANGS
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS
IN FACT I AM AGREEABLY SURPRISED AT THE EASE WITH WHICH I UNDERSTAND THE NATIVES AND THE PLEASURE I DERIVE FROM THEIR CONVERSATION FOR AFTER WRESTLING WITH ONE OR TWO MODERN NOVELS DEALING WITH THE HIGHLANDS I HAD EXPECTED TO FIND THE LANGUAGE AN UNKNOWN TONGUE
AH THE PORRIDGE GAVE ME MY LOOPHOLE OF ESCAPE WELL AS I WAS SAYING JANE GROWS WORN AND THIN OLD MARGERY'S PORRIDGE NOTWITHSTANDING BUT NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY IS FLOURISHING AND REMAINS A PRETTY DAINTY LITTLE THING
AND AS HE SPOKE THE LAST TWO WORDS HE TURNED THEM GENTLY OVER AND BENDING KISSED EACH PALM WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY TENDER REVERENCE THEN LOOSING THEM
HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
I AM GLAD NURSE ROSEMARY IS PROVING SO EFFICIENT BUT I HOPE WE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE YET ANOTHER COMPLICATION IN OUR PROBLEM SUPPOSE OUR PATIENT FALLS IN LOVE WITH DAINTY LITTLE NURSE ROSEMARY WHERE WILL JANE BE THEN
JANE MARCHING ABOUT IN THE COLD OUTSIDE AND HEARING THEM TALK REALISES HOW LITTLE SHE UNDERSTOOD THE BEAUTIFUL GIFT WHICH WAS LAID AT HER FEET HOW LITTLE SHE HAD GRASPED THE NATURE AND MIND OF THE MAN WHOM SHE DISMISSED AS A MERE BOY
BUT FURTHER NORTH AT THE BITTER LAKES A MERE MATTER OF DETAIL IN NO WAY AFFECTING THE EXTREME APPOSITENESS OF YOUR ILLUSTRATION RATHER ADDING TO IT FOR I FEAR THERE ARE BITTER WATERS AHEAD OF YOU MY POOR GIRL STILL I AM HOPEFUL
WHAT A LOT HE SAID SMILING IN PLEASURABLE ANTICIPATION I SAY MISS GRAY
POOR JANE HAS GOT NO FURTHER THAN HEARING FROM HIS OWN LIPS THAT SHE IS THE VERY LAST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD HE WOULD WISH SHOULD COME NEAR HIM IN HIS BLINDNESS WHEN SHE WAS SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE VISITOR HE SAID
THE GOLDEN DESERTS OF EGYPT I HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU AND UNDERSTOOD THEM BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU OH DAL I SHOULD LIKE TO COME AND TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THEM AND LET YOU SEE THEM THROUGH MY EYES AND THEN YOU WOULD WIDEN OUT MY NARROW UNDERSTANDING OF THEM
YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
AND LOOKED UPON ME STANDING SILENTLY BY AS A PERSON WHO EVIDENTLY DELIGHTED IN GIVING UNNECESSARY TROUBLE HAD IT BEEN DEAR OLD MARGERY WITH HER SCOTCH TONGUE
EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT GIVE UP THE NILE TRIP BUT AN EARLY BEE HUMMED IN FROM THE HYACINTHS AND BUZZED AGAINST THE PANE OTHERWISE THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL BUT OF COURSE IF YOU HAD SENT FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE COME
AND IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT NO GROTESQUE SPELLING ON MY PART COULD CONVEY TO YOUR MIND ANY BUT A CARICATURED VERSION OF THE PRETTY SCOTCH ACCENT WITH WHICH MARGERY SAYS STIR THE PORRIDGE NURSE GRAY
THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY
THE LAST OF THE PILE LAY ON THE TABLE AS SHE TOOK IT UP GARTH WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT FLUNG HIS CIGARETTE END THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LAY BACK SHADING HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND DID I SHOOT STRAIGHT NURSE HE ASKED
SO I SENT FOR SIMPSON AND MARGERY TO THE DINING ROOM THAT EVENING WHEN THE MASTER WAS SAFELY OUT OF EAR SHOT AND TOLD THEM THAT FOR REASONS WHICH I COULD NOT FULLY EXPLAIN A VERY INCORRECT DESCRIPTION OF MY APPEARANCE HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM
YOURS ALWAYS DEVOTEDLY DERYCK BRAND FROM SIR DERYCK BRAND TO DOCTOR ROBERT MACKENZIE DEAR MACKENZIE
SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
I KNEW MIGDOL MEANT TOWERS BUT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PASSAGE UNTIL I STOOD UPON THAT NARROW WEDGE OF DESERT WITH THE RED SEA IN FRONT AND ON THE LEFT THE ROCKY RANGE OF GEBEL ATTAKA ON THE RIGHT
BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS
IT APPEARS TO ME YOUR ATTENTION IS GIVEN ENTIRELY TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND PLATTER AND YOU CARE NOTHING FOR ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT LIE WITHIN SO IT IS JUST AS WELL TO KEEP HIM DECEIVED MISS GRAY
O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS WHEN JANE LEFT THE PLATFORM GARTH WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
WILL YOU KINDLY OPEN IT NURSE AND TELL ME THE SIGNATURE BEFORE READING THE REST OF THE LETTER NURSE ROSEMARY FOUGHT WITH HER THROAT WHICH THREATENED TO CLOSE ALTOGETHER AND STIFLE HER VOICE SHE OPENED THE LETTER
AND WAS LEAVING THE PLATFORM WHEN A SUDDEN BURST OF WILD APPLAUSE BROKE FROM THE AUDIENCE JANE HESITATED PAUSED LOOKED AT HER AUNT'S GUESTS AS IF ALMOST SURPRISED TO FIND THEM THERE THEN THE SLOW SMILE DAWNED IN HER EYES AND PASSED TO HER LIPS
DOCTOR BRAND WOULD READ YOU SATURDAY'S AND SUNDAY'S AH I FORGOT THERE IS NO SUNDAY POST SO I SHOULD MISS BUT ONE AND HE WOULD MORE THAN TAKE MY PLACE IN OTHER WAYS VERY WELL SAID GARTH STRIVING NOT TO SHOW DISAPPOINTMENT
THE MOONLIGHT CALLED UP MEMORIES I HAD JUST MADE UP MY MIND TO GIVE UP THE NILE
DIRECT TO ME AT MY AUNT'S TOWN HOUSE ALL MY LETTERS GO THERE AND ARE FORWARDED UNOPENED LET ME COME AND OH DO BELIEVE THAT I KNOW SOMETHING OF HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU BUT GOD CAN ENABLE BELIEVE ME TO BE
READ TO HIM AND PASS ACROSS SHOULD THERE CHANCE TO BE ONE AMONG THEM HE WISHED TO TOUCH OR TO KEEP IN HIS POCKET THEY WERE SEATED CLOSE TO THE FRENCH WINDOW OPENING ON TO THE TERRACE THE BREEZE FRAGRANT WITH THE BREATH OF SPRING FLOWERS BLEW ABOUT THEM
RIGHT AGAIN SAID NURSE ROSEMARY SMILING AND AGAIN HOW DID YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU GAVE A LITTLE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER READING THE FIRST LINE
AS SHE TOOK HER SEAT JANE SUDDENLY MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SING THE ROSARY AGAIN SHE HAD MANY FINER SONGS IN HER REPERTOIRE THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED ANOTHER WHY SHOULD SHE DISAPPOINT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF THE IMPERIOUS DEMANDS OF
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
I KNOW IT IS HARDER FOR YOU THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ANY OF US BUT YOU WILL BE BRAVER OVER IT THAN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND YOU WILL COME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY AND GO ON THINKING LIFE BEAUTIFUL AND MAKING IT SEEM SO TO OTHER PEOPLE
TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
THE STONES ADHERING BY NO SOIL OR FIBROUS ROOTS OF VEGETATION ROLLED AWAY FROM UNDER OUR FEET AND RUSHED DOWN THE PRECIPICE BELOW WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN AVALANCHE AT SOME PLACES THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN FORMED AN ANGLE WITH THE HORIZON OF AT LEAST THIRTY SIX DEGREES
OF WHICH AN ANCIENT PEOPLE GAVE ITS NAME TO THIS SYSTEM SPECIMENS OF MAGNIFICENT MARBLES CLOTHED THE WALLS SOME OF A GREYISH AGATE FANTASTICALLY VEINED WITH WHITE OTHERS OF RICH CRIMSON OR YELLOW DASHED WITH SPLOTCHES OF RED
BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
THEN I REMEMBERED THE THEORY OF AN ENGLISH CAPTAIN WHO LIKENED THE EARTH TO A VAST HOLLOW SPHERE IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS BECAUSE OF THE VAST PRESSURE THAT WEIGHED UPON IT WHILE
I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
THESE REFLECTIONS CAME INTO MY MIND WHILST I WAS CONTEMPLATING THE MINERAL WEALTH STORED UP IN THIS PORTION OF THE GLOBE THESE NO DOUBT I THOUGHT WILL NEVER BE DISCOVERED THE WORKING OF SUCH DEEP MINES WOULD INVOLVE TOO LARGE AN OUTLAY
BOTH DARK AND NARROW WHICH WERE WE TO TAKE THIS WAS A DIFFICULTY STILL MY UNCLE REFUSED TO ADMIT AN APPEARANCE OF HESITATION EITHER BEFORE ME OR THE GUIDE HE POINTED OUT THE EASTERN TUNNEL
JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
THERE WERE TALL GRASSES FERNS LYCOPODS BESIDES SIGILLARIA ASTEROPHYLLITES NOW SCARCE PLANTS BUT THEN THE SPECIES MIGHT BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS THE COAL MEASURES OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO THIS PERIOD OF PROFUSE VEGETATION
HERE AND THERE I COULD SEE PUFFS AND JETS OF STEAM CURLING UP INTO THE AIR CALLED IN ICELANDIC REYKIR ISSUING FROM THERMAL SPRINGS AND INDICATING BY THEIR MOTION THE VOLCANIC ENERGY UNDERNEATH THIS SEEMED TO JUSTIFY MY FEARS
HANS AND MY UNCLE CLINGING TO THE WALL TRIED TO NIBBLE A FEW BITS OF BISCUIT LONG MOANS ESCAPED FROM MY SWOLLEN LIPS AFTER SOME TIME MY UNCLE APPROACHED ME AND RAISED ME IN HIS ARMS
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
INCREASED MATERIALLY AND THEREFORE ALSO ITS POWERS OF RESISTANCE IT MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED WHAT VAST QUANTITIES OF ELASTIC GASES WHAT MASSES OF MOLTEN MATTER ACCUMULATED BENEATH ITS SOLID SURFACE WHILST NO EXIT WAS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COOLING OF THE TRACHYTIC CRUST
MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
AND SOMETIMES FORM BARRIERS STRONG ENOUGH TO IMPEDE THE COURSE OF A SHIP BUT NEVER I THINK WERE SUCH SEAWEEDS AS THOSE WHICH WE SAW FLOATING IN IMMENSE WAVING LINES
SAELLVERTU SAID THE HUNTER GOD DAG SAID THE BLACKSMITH IN GOOD DANISH
IF THAT ILL ADVISED SAKNUSSEMM HAS TOLD A TRUE TALE WE SHALL LOSE OUR WAY AMIDST THE DEEP SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES OF THIS VOLCANO NOW THERE IS NO PROOF THAT SNAEFELL IS EXTINCT WHO CAN ASSURE US THAT AN ERUPTION IS NOT BREWING AT THIS VERY MOMENT
THE ONLY ROOM WHERE A FIRE WAS LIGHTED EVEN IN THE SEVEREST COLD MY UNCLE LOST NO TIME IN OBEYING THE FRIENDLY CALL NOR WAS I SLACK IN FOLLOWING THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE ANCIENT PATTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A STONE FOR A HEARTH
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
AND IN SPITE OF HIS IMPATIENCE HE DECIDED ON STOPPING HE THEREFORE SPOKE TO THE HUNTER WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD SAYING OFVANFOER IT SEEMS WE MUST GO HIGHER SAID MY UNCLE THEN HE ASKED HANS FOR HIS REASON MISTOUR REPLIED THE GUIDE
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
PERHAPS WE MAY YET MEET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAURIANS WHICH SCIENCE HAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF A BIT OF BONE OR CARTILAGE I TOOK UP THE TELESCOPE AND SCANNED THE WHOLE HORIZON AND FOUND IT EVERYWHERE A DESERT SEA
THE GLISTENING BLUISH RAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT HERE AND THERE REFLECTED BY THE DANCING DROPS OF SPRAY SHOT OUT LITTLE SHEAVES OF LIGHT FROM THE TRACK WE LEFT IN OUR REAR SOON WE ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF LAND
SUCH AS IT WAS IT DID US GOOD SERVICE THE STEEPNESS INCREASED BUT THESE STONE STEPS ALLOWED US TO RISE WITH FACILITY AND EVEN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT HAVING RESTED FOR A MOMENT WHILE MY COMPANIONS CONTINUED THEIR ASCENT
GO OFF BY WAY OF THE CRATER INSTEAD OF ESCAPING BY THEIR USUAL PASSAGES THROUGH THE FISSURES IN THE SOIL THEREFORE IF THESE VAPOURS REMAIN IN THEIR USUAL CONDITION IF THEY DISPLAY NO AUGMENTATION OF FORCE
THE LAST TUFTS OF GRASS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH OUR FEET NOT A TREE WAS TO BE SEEN UNLESS WE EXCEPT A FEW DWARF BIRCHES AS LOW AS BRUSHWOOD
WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
THUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS SEA CONTAINS NONE BUT SPECIES KNOWN TO US IN THEIR FOSSIL STATE IN WHICH FISHES AS WELL AS REPTILES ARE THE LESS PERFECTLY AND COMPLETELY ORGANISED THE FARTHER BACK THEIR DATE OF CREATION
I WILL LOOK I HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED PACES BEFORE INCONTESTABLE PROOFS PRESENTED THEMSELVES IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW US STRETCHED THE SEA WE HAD PASSED THE LIMIT OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOISTURE OF THE CLIMATE
HANS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF HIS PASSIVE NATURE I I CONFESS WITH COMPLAINTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF DESPAIR I HAD NO SPIRIT TO OPPOSE THIS ILL FORTUNE AS I HAD FORETOLD
LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
SOMETIMES STRETCHED IN LENGTH SOMETIMES CONTORTED TOGETHER AN IMMENSE TORRENT ONCE LIQUID NOW SOLID RAN FROM THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS NOW EXTINCT VOLCANOES BUT THE RUINS AROUND REVEALED THE VIOLENCE OF THE PAST ERUPTIONS
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
THE WAY WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE ARDUOUS THE ASCENT STEEPER AND STEEPER THE LOOSE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK TREMBLED BENEATH US AND THE UTMOST CARE WAS NEEDED TO AVOID DANGEROUS FALLS HANS WENT ON AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ON LEVEL GROUND
MORE THAN ONCE I DROPPED DOWN MOTIONLESS THEN THERE WAS A HALT AND MY UNCLE AND THE ICELANDER DID THEIR BEST TO RESTORE ME BUT I SAW THAT THE FORMER WAS STRUGGLING PAINFULLY AGAINST EXCESSIVE FATIGUE AND THE TORTURES OF THIRST
HOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NIGHT TIME BUT UNDER THE SIXTY FIFTH PARALLEL THERE WAS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THE NOCTURNAL POLAR LIGHT IN ICELAND DURING THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY THE SUN DOES NOT SET
DEEP SHADOWS REPOSED UPON THEIR LOWER WREATHS AND OFTEN BETWEEN TWO SEPARATED FIELDS OF CLOUD THERE GLIDED DOWN A RAY OF UNSPEAKABLE LUSTRE BUT IT WAS NOT SOLAR LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO HEAT
S THE HANDWRITING OF THIS LETTER WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THERE WERE MISTAKES IN SPELLING IN WELL NIGH EVERY LINE STILL ITS MEANING WAS CLEAR AND EXACT AND COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE MOST FLATTERING HOPES
YOU TELL THEM ALL THEY DESIRE TO KNOW AND AFTERWARD IF YOU VENTURE TO ASK THEM ANYTHING THEY REPLY NOTHING OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IT MAKES THEM PROUD LOOKING THROUGH THE LITTLE LATTICED WINDOW IN THE DOOR
REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
I TRAVELED MOST OF THE TIME IN ENGLAND AND GERMANY THEN YOU ARE A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE HOW IS IT THAT YOUR HANDS ARE SO WHITE AND SOFT
DOES HE INDEED RECOGNIZE THE PLACE AND HIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISQUIETUDE INCREASED
HENCE IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO THIS NOTORIOUSLY DANGEROUS DRINKING SHOP BY THE LIGHT THAT STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN SOME VERY RECKLESS PERSON RETURNING LATE AT NIGHT FROM THE BALL AT THE RAINBOW
AT TIMES I COULD SCARCELY RESTRAIN MY ADMIRATION WHAT IS A FAMOUS COMEDIAN BESIDE THAT FELLOW THE GREATEST ACTORS NEED THE ADJUNCT OF STAGE SCENERY TO SUPPORT THE ILLUSION WHEREAS THIS MAN ENTIRELY UNAIDED
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION HE ASKED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD FORMED HIS OPINION A LONG WHILE AGO BUT HOW COULD HE A HUMBLE POLICE AGENT VENTURE TO EXPRESS ANY DECIDED VIEWS WHEN THE MAGISTRATE HESITATED
LONG LIFE TO THE QUEEN
POSTILIONS THESE FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN CONCLUDED THE SUPERINTENDENT RANG FOR ONE OF THE KEEPERS CONDUCT THIS MAN TO NO THREE OF THE SECRET CELLS HE ORDERED THERE WAS NO NEED TO DRAG THE PRISONER AWAY HE WALKED OUT AS HE HAD ENTERED
EVIDENTLY SUPPOSING THIS TO BE A JEST ON THE PART OF THE MAGISTRATE AH HA
SHE WAS A KIND HEARTED WOMAN SHE TOOK ME EXAMINED ME FED ME AND SAID HE'S A STRONG HEALTHY CHILD AND WE'LL KEEP HIM SINCE HIS MOTHER HAS BEEN SO WICKED AS TO ABANDON HIM BY THE ROADSIDE I WILL TEACH HIM
THIS FRIGHTFUL EXAMINATION HAD LASTED NO LESS THAN SEVEN CONSECUTIVE HOURS THE SMILING CLERK WHO HAD KEPT HIS PLACE AT HIS DESK BUSILY WRITING THE WHOLE WHILE NOW ROSE TO HIS FEET
A MAXIM INTENDED TO ASSURE HIS AFTER FAME AND WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS ALWAYS SUSPECT THAT WHICH SEEMS PROBABLE AND BEGIN BY BELIEVING WHAT APPEARS INCREDIBLE
AFTER THE SALAD BOWL THE TWO MEN PICKED UP FIVE OF THE WEIGHTY GLASSES ORDINARILY USED IN WINE SHOPS AND WHICH WHILE LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY WOULD CONTAIN HALF A BOTTLE ARE IN POINT OF FACT SO THICK AT THE BOTTOM
LECOQ WISHED TO INSIST UPON A HEARING
NOT A WORD OF HIS LONG STORY HAD RUNG FALSE NOW
WHEN I SAW MYSELF INTERRED IN THAT LIVING TOMB WHICH YOU CALL A SECRET CELL I GREW AFRAID I LOST MY SENSES I SAID TO MYSELF MY BOY THEY'VE BURIED YOU ALIVE AND IT IS BETTER TO DIE TO DIE QUICKLY IF YOU DON'T WISH TO SUFFER
THE WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY HAVE BUT ONE SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT MAY BE THEIR CONDITION IN LIFE THEY DENY EVERYTHING PERSIST IN THEIR DENIALS EVEN WHEN THE PROOF AGAINST THEM IS OVERWHELMING AND THEN THEY CRY
YOU ONLY WEAR BOOTS ON SUNDAYS THEN REMARKED LECOQ WHY DO YOU THINK THAT BY THE MUD WITH WHICH YOUR FEET ARE COVERED
NOT BEFORE THE CLEVEREST HE HAD CERTAINLY OVERWHELMED THE OLD VETERAN BY HIS SUPERIORITY HE HAD LITERALLY CRUSHED HIM BUT WHAT GREAT MERIT WHAT WONDERFUL VICTORY WAS THIS
BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
THE PRISONER CEASED HIS MOCKING MANNER ASSUMED AN AIR OF COMICAL IMPORTANCE AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
THROWN HIMSELF INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND THE COACHMAN WAS ALREADY WHIPPING UP THE HORSE AND TO THINK THAT HE'S AN INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE PANTED LECOQ
I LODGE AT HIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SMALL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS YOU SEE THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN PAPILLON CALLED HIM BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MORGUE YOU WILL WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE SAID
ENOUGH INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE HOW OLD ARE YOU FORTY FOUR OR FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHERE WERE YOU BORN IN BRITTANY PROBABLY
FOR A RUMBLE OF WHEELS NOW ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THAT LUGUBRIOUS VEHICLE THE BLACK MARIA WHEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS REMOVED FROM HER CELL
WHEN HE WAS PLACED IN A CELL BANG HE FELL DOWN LIKE A LOG OF WOOD
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ALREADY THREE TIMES SINCE YESTERDAY REJOINED THE PRISONER IMPATIENTLY
IT IS ONLY IN THE LOWEST OR IN THE HIGHEST RANKS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER SUCH GRIM ENERGY AS HE HAS DISPLAYED SUCH SCORN OF LIFE AS WELL AS SUCH REMARKABLE PRESENCE OF MIND AND RESOLUTION
THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ROLLING ALONG THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET THE DRIVER PULLED UP AND TURNING TO LECOQ EXCLAIMED HERE WE ARE THAT'S THE HOUSE THE HUSSIES WENT INTO
OWING TO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SHROUDED THE FINISH OF THE FINAL ACT A FINISH THAT ONLY TOO OFTEN BELIED THE ORDINARY RULES AND DEDUCTIONS OF WRITERS FOR THE STAGE WHAT A KNAVE HE EXCLAIMED
WHO WAS AS SKILFUL IN MANAGING HIS QUESTIONS AS A TRIED GENERAL IN MANEUVERING HIS TROOPS
WAS AS REAL AS HIS AFTER STUPOR AT ALL EVENTS THERE SEEMED NO FEAR OF THE DANGER THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT HAD SPOKEN OF
WHAT OF THAT EXCLAIMED THE PRISONER IN AN INSOLENT TONE IS IT A CRIME NOT TO HAVE A MARCHIONESS'S FEET IT IS A CRIME YOU ARE NOT GUILTY OF AT ALL EVENTS SAID THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SLOWLY DO YOU THINK I CAN'T SEE
THAT HE SHOULD SUSPECT OUR PRESENT PERPLEXITY AH YOU ARE A HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT EXCLAIMED THE MAGISTRATE I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF IN HIS POSITION HE CAN SCARCELY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AS YET
JUDGING THE BARE GROUND UPON WHICH THE CABIN WAS BUILT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE FEET OF HER CUSTOMERS THIS GROUND WHICH MUST ORIGINALLY HAVE BEEN WELL BEATEN DOWN HAD BY CONSTANT USE AND DAMP
ALTHOUGH I FEAR FRESH ATTACKS OF FRENZY I DISLIKE TO CONFINE HIM IN THE STRAIT JACKET AGAIN LEAVE HIM FREE IN HIS CELL
HE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED TO HAVE TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST MEASURE OF SELF PROTECTION ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY THE FIREPLACE
A CANDLE WITH A CHARRED SMOKING WICK CAST ITS FLICKERING LIGHT UPON THE SAME SCENE OF DISORDER REVEALING TO VIEW THE RIGID FEATURES OF THE THREE VICTIMS WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT
ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT WHENEVER HE CONSIDERED THAT A PRISONER HAD COMMITTED SOME GRAVE BLUNDER IN THAT CASE SAID HE WILL YOU GIVE ME A SPECIMEN OF YOUR TALENT
BROUGHT ME SOME BREAD AND WINE AT THE STATION HOUSE WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOMETHING
HOW DID THESE TWO WOMEN ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION
HE WAS SEATED ON A BENCH OPPOSITE THE GRATING IN THE DOOR HIS ELBOWS RESTING ON HIS KNEES HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND
WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS INTENTIONS OR HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT IN SHORT REVEALING MORE OR LESS OF THE SECRET HE IS ENDEAVORING TO CONCEAL ALL CRIMINALS EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE MINDED UNDERSTAND THIS
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
HE HAD ALSO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE ENDOWED WITH FAR MORE CLEVERNESS THAN LECOQ HAD SUPPOSED WHAT SELF CONTROL WHAT POWERS OF DISSIMULATION HE HAD DISPLAYED HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS FROWNED WHILE UNDERGOING THE SEVEREST ORDEALS
SAID SHE THERE'S A GENTLEMAN AT THE STAIRFOOT SAID TOM HE SAYS HE HAS COME FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER MISS MELVILLE AND AS IT WAS OUR DINNER TIME HE WOULD NOT COME UP
BUT TO OTHERS WHO LIKE MANY BEFORE HIM HAD INTELLIGENTLY ACCEPTED OF A STERNER THEOLOGY AND WHO HAD BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH YEARS OF CHAOTIC DOUBTS AND FANCIES FOR FOOTING ON WHICH TO REST HE SAW THAT THESE ASSURANCES GAVE REAL STRENGTH AND SUPPORT
WHO HAD SO LONG MOURNED FOR HER YOUNGEST BORN THAT HE WAS EXPECTING HER SOON TO JOIN HIM IN THE SPIRIT LAND THE PLACE WHERE THE OLD LADY LIVED WAS MENTIONED AND HER STATE OF HEALTH WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING BAD ALL PERFECTLY TRUE PERFECTLY TRUE MISTER HOGARTH
THOUGH I DARE SAY HE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ON THE SAME SUBJECT MY MAN OF BUSINESS SAID PEGGY WITH A LITTLE PRIDE I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM FOR A LONG TIME HE IS VERY SORRY INDEED THAT YOU LET THE TENANT HAVE A RIGHT OF PURCHASE TO YOUR SHOP
AND THE CONTINUED POOR LIVING AND THE HURRIED MEALS BEGAN TO TELL UPON A CONSTITUTION NATURALLY MUCH LESS ROBUST THAN JANE'S SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO LOOK PALE AND THIN AND COUGHED A GOOD DEAL AND LOST HER APPETITE
BRANDON HIMSELF FOR LEADING HER TO BELIEVE THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE OF COURSE HE WOULD ASK HER HE COULD NOT HELP DOING SO BUT AS TO ACCEPTING HIM THAT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT QUESTION
BUT IN YOUR HANDS I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL BE TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT HERE COME THE BAIRNS NOW SAID PEGGY AS THE QUICK NOISY STEPS OF THE HEAVILY SHOD CHILDREN WERE HEARD CLATTERING UP THE STAIRS
FRANCIS WAS WONDERING IF HIS FATHER NOW SAW THE MISTAKE HE HAD COMMITTED OR REGRETTED IT WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ROOM AND WISHED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
I HAVE LEARNED UPON HOW VERY LITTLE THE HUMAN SOUL CAN BE KEPT IN WORKING ORDER FROM A POOR RHEUMATIC AND BED RIDDEN OLD WOMAN WHO IS SO GRATEFUL FOR THE USE OF ONE HAND WHILE SHE IS HELPLESS OTHERWISE
THOUGH I CERTAINLY LIKE HIS SERMONS AND HIS DEVOTIONAL SERVICES VERY MUCH IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE LEAST OF THE BLESSINGS OF MY ADVERSITY THAT I HAVE LEARNED TO PLACE MYSELF IN GOD'S HANDS AND TO FEEL THAT HE WILL DO ALL THINGS WELL FOR ME
JANE WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED IN OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMANDED INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT SHE HAD ACCESS TO BOOKS SHE WENT TO THEATRES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT EVEN MORE THAN SHE CARED FOR
AND AT THIS TIME LESS THAN EVER AND SHE TURNED TO AN ELDERLY LADY OF A VERY PLEASING COUNTENANCE WHO WITH A PRETTY GIRL OF THIRTEEN ENTERED THE SHOWROOM AT THAT MOMENT OH MISS THOMSON SAID MISS RENNIE SHAKING HANDS WITH THE NEW COMER HOW DO YOU DO
IF HE BORROWS THE MONEY
IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT WHILE THE PROPRIETORS HOUSES AND THE FARMERS HOUSES HAVE BEEN ENLARGED AND IMPROVED SO MUCH DURING THE LAST CENTURY THE COTTAGE OF THE HIND AND THE COTTER SHOULD STILL BE OF THE SAME MISERABLE DESCRIPTION
IN AN ENGLISH TYPE YOU ENJOYED FRENCH SOCIETY THEN VERY MUCH INDEED THE ART OF CONVERSING THESE FRENCH PEOPLE CARRY TO GREAT PERFECTION IT IS NOT FRIVOLOUS THOUGH IT IS LIGHT AND SPARKLING
BUT AS COMPARED WITH THE OTHER COLONIES IT OUGHT TO BEAR THE PALM ELSIE FELT THE WANT OF THIS INTELLIGENCE AND THIS VARIETY OF CHARACTER THAT JANE DESCRIBED TO HER SO MINUTELY IN HER FREQUENT LETTERS
IT WAS NOT HIS OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION THAT HE WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE UP
FOR I AM A GOOD TENANT BUT MY LANDLORD DEMURRED AT SUCH AN EXPENDITURE FOR COT HOUSES I THINK I WILL CARRY MY POINT HOWEVER YOU KNOW SAID MISS RENNIE TO MISS THOMSON OF THE NEW NEIGHBOUR YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET AT MOSS TOWER
TOM USED TO BRING TO HER THE MOST PUZZLING QUESTIONS WHICH SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO DO SO BUT INSTEAD OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORK REFRESHING HER AFTER THE SEDENTARY NEEDLEWORK
HIS THOUGHTS RECURRED AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE FELT SAD OR SERIOUS TO JANE MELVILLE TO THE WILL THAT HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND AT THE SAME TIME SO CRUELLY PARTED THEM TO THE UNKNOWN FATHER WHOSE OWN LIFE HAD BEEN BLIGHTED BY THE LOSS
AND MY FATHER'S NEVER WAS ANYTHING BUT SELF LOVE AND SELF WILL BUT WHATEVER OUR BIRTH MAY BE WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN AND EQUAL IN HIS EYES IN THAT RESPECT AT LEAST DID MADAME LENOIR SPEAK TO YOU OF HER MOTHER
IT IS REALLY A CASE LAURA IS ENGAGED TO MISTER DALZELL YOUR OLD FRIEND AND NEIGHBOUR AND SHE IS GOING TO GIVE ONE OF HER WEDDING ORDERS HERE MISSUS DUNN SHOULD BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WE NEVER
LOOK AT ALICE'S CLEVER HANDIWORK AND ALICE WAS INTRODUCED A LITTLE UNWILLINGLY INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO BE COMPLIMENTED ON HER TASTE AND HER DESPATCH AND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE TWO GENTLEMEN MISS PHILLIPS WAS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED WITH HER BONNET
CERTAINLY THE TWO GIRLS IN MOURNING WERE NOT THE PLAINEST LOOKING IN THE ROOM NEITHER SISTER WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT ELSIE WAS VERY NEARLY SO AND HER RECENT SUFFERING HAD THROWN MORE INTENSITY INTO HER EXPRESSION
A MAN WITH NO RELATIONS WHO RECOGNIZED HIS EXISTENCE AND WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF THE DOUBTFULNESS OF HIS BIRTH AS I WAS
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SHOWN MORE GENTLENESS AND AFFECTION BOTH TO HER BROTHER'S WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN HE ANALYSED AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE HER EXPRESSIONS AND WEIGHED HER OPINIONS AND FOUND THEY GENERALLY HAD MORE SOUND THAN SENSE
OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS DEALING SO FATAL A BLOW TO THE SON WHOM HE MEANT TO BLESS AND REWARD BY PLACING HIM IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE HE COULD NOT HELP LOVING JANE AND FORBIDDING SO FAR AS HE COULD FORBID THE MARRIAGE OF TWO SOULS MADE FOR ONE ANOTHER
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER THEN TO MAKE HER FOREGO HER CLAIMS ON YOU A SUM OF MONEY WAS THE REPLY FRANCIS OBSERVED A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE RAPS PROCEEDING FROM MISTER HOGARTH FROM THOSE OF THE SPIRIT LAST SUMMONED
I MUST LOOK IN ON PEGGY WALKER
AFTER A TIME SAID THE SPIRIT RAPPING BY THE ALPHABET THIS ANSWER TO HIS INAUDIBLE QUESTION YOU THEN CAN ANSWER MENTAL QUESTIONS THOUGHT FRANCIS WHAT CONNECTION CAN MISTER PHILLIPS POSSIBLY HAVE WITH MISSUS PECK OR RATHER ELIZABETH HOGARTH
I HAVE NO WISH TO RETURN TO AUSTRALIA SAID MISTER PHILLIPS IF I CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD TO LIVE HERE WITH A FAMILY LIKE MINE ENGLAND OFFERS SO MANY ADVANTAGES IN FACT
I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR SUCH GOOD ACCOUNTS OF YOUR SISTER GETTING A SITUATION WITH SOME RICH COLONIAL PEOPLE IN LONDON AND I HEAR TOO THAT YOU ARE A REMARKABLY GOOD HAND IN YOUR OWN LINE SO I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU TO MAKE ME A CAP AND A BONNET
AND HIS PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS AND THOUGHT DOMESTIC HAPPINESS CHEAPLY PURCHASED BY SUCH PRIVATIONS AND IF JANE COULD HAVE SHARED HIS BRIGHTER FORTUNE
THESE RAPS WERE STILL STRONGER THAN THOSE OF MISTER HOGARTH BEING VIOLENT AND FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY ON THE QUESTION WHEREVER A NEGATIVE OR AFFIRMATIVE WAS USED MISTER DEMPSTER SAID HE HAD BEEN A POWERFUL YOUNG MAN
JANE'S PROPOSAL ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT TO GO TO MISSUS DUNN'S HAD DISTRESSED HIM MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF HER PROJECTS AND YET HE COULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT IT UNLESS BY MAKING THE SACRIFICE WHICH MY YOUNG LADY READERS THINK HE SHOULD HAVE MADE
OR SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA IN THOSE DAYS A SLIGHT SAVOUR OF BOTANY BAY WAS SUPPOSED TO HANG ABOUT THEM ALL BUT THEY FORMED A PLEASANT LITTLE CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN LESS EXCLUSIVE THAN MOST CLIQUES
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WAS ALL THE WORLD TO HIM WOULD CHANGE IT INTO LOVE AND THEN TO BEGIN LIFE AFRESH NO LONGER SOLITARY NO LONGER UNLOVED
SHE HAD RETURNED ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE GIRLS WERE GETTING READY TO JOIN THEIR COUSIN IN THEIR PROMISED WALK AND JUST AS SHE GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS A MAN'S FOOT WAS HEARD AT THE BOTTOM
AND INTO OUR BUSINESS IT WILL NOT BE OF MUCH USE TO US THE SOUND OF A WELL KNOWN VOICE ARRESTED JANE'S ATTENTION IT WAS THAT OF WILLIAM DALZELL WHO WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH MISTER MISSUS AND MISS RENNIE VERY CORDIALLY AND THEN
IT IS STILL LESS ARGUMENTATIVE BUT IT HAS THE KNACK OF BRINGING OUT DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THEM WE PITY THE FRENCH FOR THEIR WANT OF POLITICAL LIBERTY BUT THE SOCIAL FREEDOM THEY ENJOY IS SOME COMPENSATION
AND WHO HAS HAD A VERY BAD HUSBAND AND SEVERAL VERY CARELESS AND COLD HEARTED CHILDREN BUT SHE HAS ONE SON WHO COMES TO SEE HER REGULARLY ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS AND BRINGS HER THE SCANTY PITTANCE ON WHICH SHE SUBSISTS
WITH MUCH MORE ANIMATION THAN WAS USUAL WITH HER NOW SAID MISS RENNIE I HAVE DONE MY BEST FOR MISTER DALZELL I MUST ATTEND TO MY OTHER STRANGER BEFORE I FULFIL MY ENGAGEMENT TO YOU MISTER HOGARTH AND I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
AND THEN DREW HER INTO A QUIET CORNER IN A WINDOW SEAT WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING MUCH OBSERVED ELSIE DID NOT SIT BESIDE THEM BUT LEFT THEM TO THEIR OWN CONVERSATION ASSURED THAT SHE WOULD HEAR ALL THAT SHE CARED TO KNOW BY AND BY
NEXT HE WAS STOPPED AT E THEN AT N THEN AT R AND NEXT AT Y AND SO ON TILL THE FULL NAME OF HENRY HOGARTH WAS SPELLED OUT YOU WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME THEN YOU LOVE ME NOW
THAT WILL KEEP ON MY HEAD AND THAT IS WHAT I CANNOT GET THE FASHIONABLE MILLINER I HAVE EMPLOYED SO LONG TO MAKE ME THIS YEAR BACK I CAN MAKE TO PLEASE PEGGY WALKER SAID ELSIE SMILING BUT YOU WILL WISH FOR MORE STYLE
CAN YOU NOT PLACE YOUR SISTER IN THE SAME CARE ASKED FRANCIS
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TYPE FREE SPIRIT AS ITS NON FREEDOM
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER SO LONG AS THOU FEELEST THE STARS AS AN ABOVE THEE THOU LACKEST THE EYE OF THE DISCERNING ONE SEVENTY TWO
THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
ONE FINDS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN
AND SOCRATES AND THE SCIENTIFIC MAN EIGHTY ONE IT IS TERRIBLE TO DIE OF THIRST AT SEA IS IT NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD SO SALT YOUR TRUTH THAT IT WILL NO LONGER QUENCH THIRST
ONE MUST REPAY GOOD AND ILL BUT WHY JUST TO THE PERSON WHO DID US GOOD OR ILL
ONE CAN ALLOW ONE'S SPIRIT MANY LIBERTIES I SAID THIS ONCE BEFORE BUT PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN I SAY SO UNLESS THEY KNOW IT ALREADY EIGHTY EIGHT
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
OBJECTION EVASION JOYOUS DISTRUST AND LOVE OF IRONY ARE SIGNS OF HEALTH EVERYTHING ABSOLUTE BELONGS TO PATHOLOGY
GRATITUDE AND PURITY SEVENTY FIVE THE DEGREE AND NATURE OF A MAN'S SENSUALITY EXTENDS TO THE HIGHEST ALTITUDES OF HIS SPIRIT SEVENTY SIX
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
A DISCERNING ONE MIGHT EASILY REGARD HIMSELF AT PRESENT AS THE ANIMALIZATION OF GOD ONE HUNDRED TWO DISCOVERING RECIPROCAL LOVE SHOULD REALLY DISENCHANT THE LOVER WITH REGARD TO THE BELOVED
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
TO HIM WHO FEELS HIMSELF PREORDAINED TO CONTEMPLATION AND NOT TO BELIEF ALL BELIEVERS ARE TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE HE GUARDS AGAINST THEM
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
AND EVEN HIMSELF ONLY IN RELATION TO HIS PUPILS SIXTY FOUR KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE THAT IS THE LAST SNARE LAID BY MORALITY WE ARE THEREBY COMPLETELY ENTANGLED IN MORALS ONCE MORE
THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
THE VANITY OF OTHERS IS ONLY COUNTER TO OUR TASTE WHEN IT IS COUNTER TO OUR VANITY
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
A SIGN OF STRONG CHARACTER WHEN ONCE THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHUT THE EAR EVEN TO THE BEST COUNTER ARGUMENTS OCCASIONALLY THEREFORE A WILL TO STUPIDITY
YE UTILITARIANS YE TOO LOVE THE UTILE ONLY AS A VEHICLE FOR YOUR INCLINATIONS YE TOO REALLY FIND THE NOISE OF ITS WHEELS INSUPPORTABLE
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
OUR VANITY IS MOST DIFFICULT TO WOUND JUST WHEN OUR PRIDE HAS BEEN WOUNDED
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
THAT WHICH AN AGE CONSIDERS EVIL IS USUALLY AN UNSEASONABLE ECHO OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED GOOD THE ATAVISM OF AN OLD IDEAL
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
THE ONE SEEKS AN ACCOUCHEUR FOR HIS THOUGHTS THE OTHER SEEKS SOME ONE WHOM HE CAN ASSIST A GOOD CONVERSATION THUS ORIGINATES
ONE BEGINS TO DISTRUST VERY CLEVER PERSONS WHEN THEY BECOME EMBARRASSED EIGHTY NINE DREADFUL EXPERIENCES RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER HE WHO EXPERIENCES THEM
AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
NOT THEIR LOVE OF HUMANITY BUT THE IMPOTENCE OF THEIR LOVE PREVENTS THE CHRISTIANS OF TODAY BURNING US
SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
AROUND THE HERO EVERYTHING BECOMES A TRAGEDY
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
JESUS SAID TO HIS JEWS THE LAW WAS FOR SERVANTS LOVE GOD AS I LOVE HIM AS HIS SON WHAT HAVE WE SONS OF GOD TO DO WITH MORALS
BY MEANS OF MUSIC THE VERY PASSIONS ENJOY THEMSELVES
ONE MAY INDEED LIE WITH THE MOUTH BUT WITH THE ACCOMPANYING GRIMACE ONE NEVERTHELESS TELLS THE TRUTH
DO NOT CONSTITUTE AS THEY DID IN FORMER DAYS THE ELITE OF SOCIETY ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INFERIOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS IN RUSSIA AND TURKEY AS IN AMERICA AND FRANCE
BY UNBELIEVERS IT IS REGARDED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF MAN'S CRAVING FOR A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL WHICH MANKIND HAS NOW OUTGROWN AS AN HISTORICAL PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECEIVED FULL EXPRESSION IN CATHOLICISM GREEK ORTHODOXY AND PROTESTANTISM
STILL LESS OF RICH MEN BUT RATHER OF ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE AND INVENTORS PERSONS WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNMENT
SUCH MEDIATION IS NOT WANTED AND WAS DIRECTLY FORBIDDEN BY CHRIST WHO HAS REVEALED HIS TEACHING DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY TO EACH MAN BUT THE CHURCHES SET UP DEAD FORMS IN THE PLACE OF GOD AND FAR FROM REVEALING GOD
AND MAINTAIN THAT ONE CANNOT ON ACCOUNT OF THESE ABUSES DENY THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH ALONE CAN BIND ALL MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY AND BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN MEN AND GOD BUT THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE NOT ONLY HAVE CHURCHES NEVER BOUND MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY
THE COURTIERS COME TO LOOK AT THE TAILORS WORK AND SEE NOTHING FOR THE MEN ARE PLYING THEIR NEEDLES IN EMPTY SPACE BUT REMEMBERING THE EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES THEY ALL DECLARE THEY SEE THEM AND ARE LOUD IN THEIR ADMIRATION
DEVELOPED INTO POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLES TO THE DIFFUSION OF A TRUE COMPREHENSION OF THE TEACHING OF CHRIST IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THE CHIEF PECULIARITY WHICH DISTINGUISHED CHRIST'S TEACHING
WHO TRY TO BE AS UNLIKE MONARCHS AND AS LIKE PLAIN MORTALS AS POSSIBLE WHO STATE THEIR READINESS TO GIVE UP THEIR PREROGATIVES AND BECOME SIMPLY THE FIRST CITIZENS OF A REPUBLIC IF THERE ARE ALREADY SOLDIERS WHO REALIZE ALL THE SIN AND HARM OF WAR
WERE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE A COMMON CAUSE THE SPRING AND THAT IF WE SEE THE BRANCHES ON SOME TREES SHOOTING AND TURNING GREEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT WILL SOON BE SO WITH ALL
THE HOLY GHOST LEFT THE CATHOLIC AND PASSED INTO THE CHURCH THEY PROFESSED AND THIS IS JUST WHAT THEY DO EVERY CHURCH TRACES ITS CREED THROUGH AN UNINTERRUPTED TRANSMISSION FROM CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES AND TRULY EVERY CHRISTIAN CREED
THEY FANCY THEY ARE VERY USEFUL INDEED BUT THE TIME WILL COME AND IS COMING WHEN IT WILL BE PERFECTLY EVIDENT TO EVERYONE THAT THEY ARE NOT OF ANY USE AT ALL AND ONLY A HINDRANCE AND THOSE WHOM THEY INTERFERE WITH WILL SAY GENTLY AND QUIETLY TO THEM
THAT WAS A SINNER OF THE ROBBER ON THE CROSS IS A GREATER STATE OF BLESSEDNESS ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE THAN THE STATIONARY RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE PHARISEE
DIVERGENCIES IN SECONDARY MATTERS ARISE FREELY IN EAST AND WEST THEOLOGY IS NOT WEDDED TO INVARIABLE FORMULAS IF IN THE MIDST OF THIS DIVERSITY A MASS OF BELIEFS COMMON TO ALL IS APPARENT
THIS LACK OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS AT SUCH A TIME WOULD BE INEXPLICABLE IF THERE WERE NOT CAUSES TO ACCOUNT FOR IT ONE OF THESE CAUSES
THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING CHRIST'S TEACHING IN ITS DIRECT SENSE ALL THIS CONVINCED ME THAT WHILE ON ONE HAND THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DOCTRINE HAD NEVER BEEN LOST TO A MINORITY BUT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED MORE AND MORE CLEARLY
AN ASSOCIATION OF MEN HAVING THE POPE AT ITS HEAD AND CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BOUND TOGETHER BY A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION FOOTNOTE THE CHURCH IS THE SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL
THE CHURCHES WITH THEIR PRINCIPLES AND THEIR PRACTICE ARE NOT A THING OF THE PAST THE CHURCHES ARE BEFORE US TO DAY AND WE CAN JUDGE OF THEM TO SOME PURPOSE BY THEIR PRACTICAL ACTIVITY THEIR INFLUENCE ON MEN
IF THE CATHOLICS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST AT THE TIME OF THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCH INTO ARIAN AND GREEK LEFT THE CHURCH THAT FELL AWAY
BUT EVEN FOR SELF PRESERVATION AND THEREFORE EXERT EVERY EFFORT OF THEIR INGENUITY TO PRESERVE IT WHAT AN INVINCIBLE POWER IT WOULD SEEM AND YET WE NEED ONLY IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT WILL REALLY INEVITABLY COME TO PASS THAT IS
INSTITUTIONS NOT ONLY ALIEN IN SPIRIT TO CHRIST'S TEACHING BUT EVEN DIRECTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO IT WITH GOOD REASON VOLTAIRE CALLS THE CHURCH L'INFAME WITH GOOD REASON HAVE ALL OR ALMOST ALL SO CALLED SECTS OF CHRISTIANS RECOGNIZED THE CHURCH
THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPREHENSIBLE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE IT HAS BEEN ONLY BY A SUCCESSION OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ERRORS PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS OF GENERATIONS
THE ONLY DEFINITION OF HERESY THE WORD
IF THE SAME UNANIMITY WHICH IS REVEALED IN ESSENTIAL POINTS OF BELIEF IS FOUND ALSO IN REJECTING CERTAIN TENDENCIES ARE WE NOT JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT THESE TENDENCIES WERE IN FLAGRANT OPPOSITION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY
NO ONE IN THE TIME OF PLATO WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO GIVE HIS NAME TO A DOCTRINE IN WHICH THE THEORY OF IDEAS HAD NO PLACE AND ONE WOULD DESERVEDLY HAVE EXCITED THE RIDICULE OF GREECE BY TRYING TO PASS OFF EPICURUS OR ZENO AS A DISCIPLE OF THE ACADEMY
HOMYAKOV ASSERTS THAT A CHURCH IS A COLLECTION OF MEN ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF CLERGY AND LAYMEN UNITED TOGETHER BY LOVE AND THAT ONLY TO MEN UNITED BY LOVE IS THE TRUTH REVEALED LET US LOVE EACH OTHER THAT
WHILE BELIEVERS WERE AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES AND THE BODY WAS ONE IT HAD NO NEED TO DECLARE ITSELF AS A CHURCH IT WAS ONLY WHEN BELIEVERS WERE SPLIT UP INTO OPPOSING PARTIES RENOUNCING ONE ANOTHER THAT IT SEEMED NECESSARY TO EACH PARTY TO CONFIRM THEIR OWN TRUTH
WAS IN BOTH FORM AND CONTENT ABSOLUTELY NEW TO THE JEWISH WORLD IN WHICH IT ORIGINATED AND STILL MORE TO THE ROMAN WORLD IN WHICH IT WAS PREACHED AND DIFFUSED
IF ANY MAN WILL DO HIS WILL HE SHALL KNOW OF THE DOCTRINE WHETHER IT BE OF GOD
ALL WE CAN KNOW IS WHAT WE WHO MAKE UP MANKIND OUGHT TO DO AND NOT TO DO TO BRING ABOUT THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
QUESTION TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THE CORRUPT TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY WERE NOT THESE VERY MEN CAST OUT DENOUNCED BY THE HYPOCRITES AND ENVIOUS WHO WERE ENDOWED BY GOD WITH GREAT GIFTS AND WHO WOULD IN THE DAYS OF PURE CHRISTIANITY HAVE BEEN HELD IN HIGH HONOR
TO A RESUME SUPPORTED BY THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF THE DISPUTES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUNCIL TO A CREED WHICH RECKONED OFF I BELIEVE IN SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO TO THE END TO ONE HOLY APOSTOLIC CHURCH
EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE SAME RULERS AND THE SAME GOVERNMENTS THE SAME ARMIES THE SAME LAW COURTS THE SAME TAX GATHERERS THE SAME PRIESTS THE SAME RICH MEN LANDOWNERS MANUFACTURERS AND CAPITALISTS AS EVER
THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SEVERAL IN NUMBER AND HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS HERESY THE WORK OF G ARNOLD ON HERESIES
AND THE ADVANCED GUARD CANNOT CEASE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE ONCE UNDERSTOOD AND WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE REST NOT ONLY CAN BUT MUST INEVITABLY UNDERSTAND HEREAFTER SO THAT THE PROPHECY THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN MEN WILL BE TAUGHT OF GOD
WHEN THE MEN OF OUR MODERN WORLD WHO FILL OFFICES BASED UPON VIOLENCE WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF THE EMPEROR IN ANDERSEN'S TALE OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
THE SAME THING IS DONE BY THE OTHER CHURCHES ALL THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE ARE SUCH AS TO DESTROY THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH AND THEREFORE THE CHURCHES USE EVERY EFFORT TO SUPPORT THEIR DOCTRINES
MILLOWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS BUILD HOSPITALS SCHOOLS SAVINGS BANKS ASYLUMS AND DWELLINGS FOR THEIR WORKPEOPLE SOME OF THEM FORM CO OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SHARES ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE OTHERS
AS EVERY OTHER SO THAT THERE IS BUT ONE STRICT AND EXACT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A CHURCH
WHO SERVED THE CHURCHES WAS THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THE MEN AND NOT OF THE INSTITUTION THEY SERVED ALL THE GOOD MEN
AND THEREFORE THE QUESTION OF BAPTIZING THE UNCIRCUMCISED COULD ONLY HAVE ARISEN AMONG MEN WHO THOUGH THEY LOVED THEIR MASTER AND DIMLY FELT THE GRANDEUR OF HIS TEACHING STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TEACHING ITSELF VERY CLEARLY AND THIS WAS THE FACT
AS EXAMPLES OF THESE QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE ANSWERS ARE TO SOME EXTENT INCLUDED ALSO I WILL QUOTE THE FOLLOWING UNDER THE FOURTH HEAD OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HERETICS ARE MADE HE SAYS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE SEVENTH
BUT THEY REST ONLY ON PUBLIC OPINION AND CAN BE DESTROYED BY IT ALREADY VIOLENCE IS REGARDED FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE READY TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DIMINISHING AND EVEN THE SERVANTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR POSITION AND SO
AND IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS POSSIBLE TO RELY ON THE ARMY FOR THE PACIFICATION OF RIOTS AND MORE AND MORE EVIDENT CONSEQUENTLY THAT GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS ARE ONLY FIGURES IN SOLEMN PROCESSIONS OBJECTS OF AMUSEMENT FOR GOVERNMENTS
WHICH HAVE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES FOR THEIR BASIS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE STRAYED A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES AS BODIES WHICH ASSERT THEIR OWN INFALLIBILITY ARE INSTITUTIONS OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY
WILL LEARN WAR NO MORE WILL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND THEIR SPEARS INTO REAPING HOOKS WHICH MEANS TRANSLATING IT INTO OUR LANGUAGE
THE EMPEROR DOES THE SAME HIMSELF THE DAY OF THE PROCESSION COMES IN WHICH THE EMPEROR IS TO GO OUT IN HIS NEW CLOTHES THE EMPEROR UNDRESSES AND PUTS ON HIS NEW CLOTHES THAT IS TO SAY REMAINS NAKED AND NAKED HE WALKS THROUGH THE TOWN
NOT THE WORD OF SUCH BROADCLOTH AND BUCKRAM GENTLEMEN AS HE IS TAKE CARE WHAT YOU SAY OR YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR USING IMPROPER LANGUAGE ABOUT THIS GENTLEMAN WE MAY HAVE A DUEL ON THE CARPET
WHEN THE SECONDS AGAIN MET IT WAS TO ARRANGE A SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES THIS COULD ONLY BE DONE BY A VERY HUMBLY WRITTEN APOLOGY WHICH WAS MADE ON THE NEXT DAY THE YOUNG OFFICER LEFT THE CITY A LITTLE WISER THAN HE CAME
BUT TO SEE WAS TO TASTE TO TASTE WAS TO FALL AT LAST HIS FRIENDS URGED HIM TO SHUT HIMSELF UP AT HOME FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND SEE IF TOTAL ABSTINENCE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM STRENGTH
THE SUBJECT THAT OCCUPIED THEIR ATTENTION SEEMED TO BE A VERY EXCITING ONE AT LEAST TO HIM OF THE MILITARY BUTTONS AND BLACK CAP FOR HE EMPHASIZED STRONGLY KNIT HIS BROW AWFULLY
WAS CALLED IN AND IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISED HIS PATIENT OF THE MORNING I'M SORRY TO FIND YOU WORSE SAID HE I DID NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT THE EFFICACY OF THE REMEDY I GAVE YOU BUT
NO ONE PRESCRIBED IT I TOOK IT ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BAR KEEPER DOWN STAIRS WHO SAID THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD CURE ME AND YOU HAD MY PRESCRIPTION IN YOUR POCKET AT THE SAME TIME
HE MAY DIE IN HALF AN HOUR I DON'T THINK THE CASE IS SO DANGEROUS MADAM APOPLEXY NOT DANGEROUS I HARDLY THINK IT APOPLEXY I REPLIED PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS DOCTOR
THEY SHOULD SHUN ADVERTISED NOSTRUMS IN THE SALE OF WHICH THE MANUFACTURERS AND VENDORS ARE INTERESTED OFTEN TESTIMONIALS AS TO THEIR EFFICACY ARE MERE FORGERIES
BY NO MEANS FOUNDED THEREON HIS CLAIM TO BE CALLED A GENTLEMAN HE NEVER LIKED L BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD NO PRINCIPLE WHATEVER THAT ALL ABOUT HIM WAS MERE SHAM THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WAS HARDLY CIVIL TO HIM
BLAKE RETURNED WITH HIS FRIEND TO HIS LODGINGS WHERE HE FOUND A BILLET ALREADY FROM REDMOND WHO WAS ALL EAGERNESS TO WING HIS RIVAL
HE WILL FIGHT THEN FIGHT OH CERTAINLY BLAKE IS NO COWARD WELL THEN NAME THE WEAPONS A PAIR OF GOOSE QUILLS SIR IN PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT
BUT THOUGH THE BLISTER BEGAN TO DRAW NO SIGNS OF RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS SHOWED THEMSELVES FURTHER THAN AN OCCASIONAL LOW MOAN OR AN UNEASY TOSSING OF THE ARMS
CONCEALED THE BARBER'S WORK UNTIL HIS OWN HAIR GREW AGAIN HE NEVER VENTURED UPON WINE OR BRANDY AGAIN FOR FEAR OF APOPLEXY WHEN THE TRUTH LEAKED OUT AS LEAK OUT SUCH THINGS ALWAYS WILL
INQUIRED THE GENTLEMAN AS HE SLIPPED THE LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER INTO HIS VEST POCKET FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE CONSULTATION AND PRESCRIPTION REPLIED THE DOCTOR BOWING
BLAKE HAD A MUCH READIER TONGUE AND A GREAT DEAL MORE IN HIS HEAD THAN THE OTHER AND COULD THEREFORE IN THE MATTER OF MIND AT LEAST APPEAR TO MUCH BETTER ADVANTAGE THAN HIS RIVAL
WE MAY PUT ON AIRS OF GENTILITY BOAST OF INDEPENDENCE AND SPIRIT AND ALL THAT BUT IT'S A MEAN KIND OF GENTILITY THAT WILL LET A MAN FLOURISH ABOUT IN A FINE COAT FOR WHICH HE OWES HIS TAILOR
FEELING MY POSITION TO BE A DIFFICULT ONE I SUGGESTED THAT THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN HAD BETTER BE CALLED BUT THE DELAY DOCTOR URGED THE FRIENDS NO HARM WILL RESULT FROM IT BE ASSURED I REPLIED
WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED INTO EXCESS BOTH HIMSELF AND FRIENDS WERE MORTIFIED AND GRIEVED AT THIS AND THEY BY ADMONITION AND HE BY GOOD RESOLUTIONS TRIED TO BRING ABOUT A REFORM
THE PRECISE TERMS IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL SWORE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE FUMED FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES NEED NOT BE TOLD HE WAS CALLED BACK TO MORE SOBER FEELINGS BY THE QUESTION DO YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE MEETING
AND WAS OFTEN QUITE AS LITERAL IN HIS OBSERVANCE OF PRESCRIBING MODES AND FORMS AS WAS THE FRENCHMAN IN SHOWING OFF HIS SKILL IN OUR IDIOMS WHEN HE INFORMED A COMPANY OF LADIES AS AN EXCUSE FOR LEAVING THEM THAT HE HAD SOME FISH TO FRY
OLD FELLOW THIS IS PREMEDITATED POVERTY BETTER WEAR PATCHED GARMENTS THAN OWE FOR NEW ONES REPLIED TOM WITH GREAT SOBRIETY BLESS US WHEN DID YOU TURN ECONOMIST EVER SINCE I TRIED TO BE A GENTLEMAN
AS OUR FRIEND BURTON HAS SAID THAT THERE WAS A TIPSY PARSON AT THE TABLE BUT AS TO THE DRUNKEN MINISTER OF MISTER PERKINS I KNOW NOTHING NEVER BEFORE IN A GRAVE AND SOLEMN ASSEMBLY OF DEACONS WAS THERE SUCH A SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL BURST OF LAUGHTER
AND FELT THAT ESPECIALLY ILL TIMED WAS THE LEVITY OF THE MINISTER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS HE SAID WITH GREAT GRAVITY I CAN EXPLAIN IT REMARKED AN INDIVIDUAL RISING
DON'T AS A GENERAL THING POSSESS MUCH TO BRAG OF THEN HE TALKS TO YOU OF HIS HONOUR OH YES AND GIVES ME HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN DOES HE ALWAYS KEEP HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN
BLAKE MUST BE CHALLENGED AND KILLED OFF AND THEN THE COURSE WOULD BE CLEAR A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS BRAVE AND HONOURABLE DETERMINATION THE OFFICER MET THE AUTHOR IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND PURPOSELY JOSTLED HIM RUDELY
SO HE TOOK UP THE CASE AGAIN AND ONCE MORE GAVE A PRESCRIPTION IN A COUPLE OF DAYS THE GENTLEMAN WAS QUITE WELL AGAIN BUT THAT MISSUS
THE PLEDGE IS ALL IMPORTANT SIGN IT I SAY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN BUT DO NOT SIGN IT BECAUSE THIS THAT OR THE OTHER TEMPERATE MAN HAS SIGNED IT BUT BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT TO BE YOUR ONLY HOPE DO IT FOR YOURSELF
IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS PRODUCED AS HE ENTERED THE GRAVE ASSEMBLY HE LOOKED AROUND WITH GREAT COMPOSURE UPON THE ARRAY OF SOLEMN FACES AND EYES INTENTLY FIXED UPON HIM HE DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST ABASHED
MISSUS H LOOKED ANXIOUSLY INTO MY FACE I DELICATELY HINTED THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH BRANDY BUT TO THIS SHE POSITIVELY AND ALMOST INDIGNANTLY OBJECTED
EVERY MAN MUST BE PERMITTED TO HAVE HIS OWN STANDARD OF GENTILITY CERTAINLY I HAVE MINE AH WELL HOW DO YOU MEASURE GENTILITY BY MY LEDGER
WILL YOUR PRINCIPAL FIND HIMSELF IN A DIFFERENT POSITION IF HE DECLINE THIS MEETING ON LIKE GROUNDS I THINK NOT PENS ARE AS GOOD AS PISTOLS AT ANY TIME AND WILL DO AS MUCH FIGHTING WITH PENS PREPOSTEROUS
THANK YOU I WILL CALL UPON HIM IMMEDIATELY SAID THE GENTLEMAN AND AWAY HE WENT THE DOCTOR FORTUNATELY AS THE GENTLEMAN MENTALLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS IN HIS OFFICE
PERKINS WAS CALLED UPON RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY TO ANSWER ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY ON THE OPENING OF THE MEETING BUT AS HE WAS A STANCH TEMPERANCE MAN AND CORDIALLY DESPISED THE MINISTER HE WAS BOLD TO REPLY
AND AT WHICH WINE WAS CIRCULATED FREELY A RATHER SCANDALOUS REPORT GOT ABROAD AND SOON WENT BUZZING ALL OVER THE VILLAGE A YOUNG MAN WHO MADE NO SECRET OF BEING FOND OF HIS GLASS AND WHO WAS AT THE DINNER PARTY MET ON THE DAY AFTER
ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH THE UTMOST GRAVITY AND WITH A DECISION OF TONE AND MANNER THAT LEFT NO DOUBT OF THE INTENTION THE SECOND WITHDREW AN HOUR ELAPSED BUT NO NEW CHALLENGE CAME
NO OF COURSE NOT THE FELLOW'S A FOOL THEN YOU CONSENT TO BE POSTED HOW WILL THAT SOUND I'LL CUT OFF THE RASCAL'S EARS IF HE DARE DO SUCH A THING THAT WON'T SECURE MARY CLINTON THE CAUSE OF THIS CONTEST HANG IT NO
I SHALL GO FOR SUSPENDING HIM UNTIL HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT I WILL GO WITH YOU IF HE SIGNS THE PLEDGE HE'S SAFE AND SO THE TWO DEACONS SETTLED THE MATTER ON THE NEXT DAY IN GRAVE COUNCIL ASSEMBLED WERE ALL THE DEACONS OF THE CHURCH
THE WEAPON HE CAN USE BEST IS THE PEN AND HE CHOOSES THAT
YOU MUST FIGHT APOLOGIZE OR BE POSTED THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO BE POSTED WON'T DO THE LAUGH WOULD BE TOO STRONGLY AGAINST YOU IT WILL BE AS BAD AND EVEN WORSE TO FIGHT AS HE PROPOSES TRUE
WHO HAD THE PASTORAL CHARGE OF A VERY RESPECTABLE CONGREGATION AND WAS HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY THEM BUT THERE WAS ONE THING IN WHICH HE DID NOT GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH MANY EXCELLENT MEMBERS OF HIS CHURCH FELT SERIOUSLY SCANDALIZED
WE CONVERSED ASIDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I GAVE HIM MY VIEWS OF THE CASE AND STATED WHAT I HAD DONE AND WHY I HAD DONE IT WE THEN PROCEEDED TO THE BEDSIDE OF OUR PATIENT THERE WERE STILL NO SIGNS OF APPROACHING CONSCIOUSNESS
ALL I SAID WAS THAT WE HAD A TIPSY PARSON AND SO WE HAD I'LL PROVE IT BEFORE A JURY OF A THOUSAND IF NECESSARY IT'S NO MORE THAN I EXPECTED SAID THE TEMPERANCE MAN
ALLEGING THAT HIS UNCLE HAD TAKEN COMPASSION ON HIM AND OUT OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS HONEST PRINCIPLES PAID OFF HIS BILLS AND MADE A GENTLEMAN OF HIM ONCE MORE NO ONE OF COURSE BELIEVED TOM TO BE SINCERE IN ALL THIS
HAS SHE NO MOTHER I SUGGESTED IN THE PAUSE HE MADE SHE HAS NO LIVING RELATIVES AND MINE ARE UNCONGENIAL TO HER THIS TO SAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I UNDERSTOOD HIM PERFECTLY
WHY LOOK AT THIS WHAT I DEMANDED HURRYING TO THE CLOSET WHERE ELLEN STOOD BENDING OVER SOMETHING INVISIBLE TO ME OH NOTHING SHE ANSWERED COMING QUICKLY OUT BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HER TONGUE GETTING THE BETTER OF HER DISCRETION SHE BLURTED OUT
MISTER STEELE WITHDREW AFTER CASTING A GLANCE OF ENTIRELY RESPECTFUL SYMPATHY AT THE WOMAN WHO UP TO THIS HOUR HAD FACED THE WORLD WITHOUT A SHADOW BETWEEN HER AND IT AND MARKING THE LINGERING NATURE OF THE LOOK WITH WHICH THE MAYOR NOW TURNED ON HIS WIFE
THE CHILD'S DIMPLED WITH DELIGHT AT THE RAPID MOVEMENT A LOVELY PICTURE LETTY WHO STOOD WAITING IN THE DOORWAY SHOWED A COUNTENANCE FULL OF SURPRISE MISSUS PACKARD WAS THE FIRST TO FEEL TIRED
FIVE OF THEM DEVOTED TO GRIEF FOR HER LOSS AND TWO TO RAGE AND BITTER REVULSION AGAINST HER WHOLE SEX WHEN I FOUND HER ALIVE AND MYSELF THE DESPISED VICTIM OF HER DECEPTION SHE WRONGED YOU SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
HE FALTERED TO HIS FEET AGAIN SAYING HUMBLY AS HE CREPT AWAY I COULDN'T HELP IT YOUR HONOR
DINNER AT SEVEN MISS THERE'LL BE NO EXTRA COMPANY TO NIGHT I'M COMING THIS TO SOME ONE IN THE HALL AS SHE HASTILY PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR DROPPING THE BAG I HAD LIFTED TO UNPACK I STARED AT THE DOOR WHICH HAD SOFTLY CLOSED UNDER HER HAND
AND REMOVAL TO C SHE FOUND HERSELF THE RECIPIENT OF AN ENORMOUS LEGACY SHE WAS THEREFORE A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS AN ADVANTAGE WHICH
ASKED A VOICE DIRECTLY OVER MY SHOULDER I WHEELED ABOUT WITH A START
RIDICULOUS OF COURSE BUT A FACT WITH WHICH MISSUS PACKARD HAS HAD TO CONTEND IN HE GAVE ME A QUICK GLANCE IN HIRING SERVANTS IT WAS NOW MY TURN TO SMILE BUT SOMEHOW I DID NOT
RAN UP STAIRS TO HAVE IT OUT IN THE NURSERY WITH LETTY AND I WENT TOWARD THE FRONT HOW LONG I SHOULD HAVE TO STAY THERE BEFORE MISSUS PACKARD'S RETURN I DID NOT KNOW SHE MIGHT STAY AWAY AN HOUR AND SHE MIGHT STAY AWAY ALL DAY
I LOOKED TO SEE THE MAYOR SPRING AND GRASP HIM BY THE THROAT BUT THAT WAS LEFT FOR ANOTHER HAND AS THE SECRETARY BENT TO TOUCH THE DOOR IT SUDDENLY FLEW VIOLENTLY OPEN AND NIXON QUIVERING IN EVERY LIMB AND WITH HIS FACE AFIRE
WITH CHEERFUL COMPOSURE WHAT SHOULD I HAVE THOUGHT IF AT THAT MOMENT I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT APPEARANCES WERE DECEITFUL AND THAT THERE WERE MANY PERSONS THEN LIVING WHO IF LEFT TO THEIR CHOICE WOULD PREFER LIFE IN THE DISMAL WALLS FROM WHICH I HAD INSTINCTIVELY TURNED
WITH A LOOK OF INQUIRY DIRECTED AT MAYOR PACKARD NEVER MIND TWO DAYS OR A WEEK IT IS ALL ONE I WOULD RATHER LOSE VOTES THAN PASS OVER SUCH AN INSULT PIN ME DOWN THE MAN WHO HAS DARED ATTACK ME THROUGH MY WIFE
BUT HER IMAGE FOLLOWED ME AND I FORGOT IT ONLY WHEN CONFRONTED ONCE AGAIN WITH MISSUS PACKARD THAT LADY WAS AWAITING ME AT THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN THROWING OFF HER SECRET DEPRESSION AND SMILED QUITE NATURALLY AS I APPROACHED
OF IRRESISTIBLE PASSION TRUE YES IT IS TRUE BUT WHAT DOES THAT TRUTH INVOLVE FOR ME NOT TWO WEEKS
THAT THIS POSSIBILITY SHOULD NOT GIVE YOU A MOMENT'S THOUGHT A BURST OF SWEET SINGING CAME FROM THE DRAWING ROOM THAT'S HER VOICE HE CRIED WHATEVER HER TROUBLE MAY BE SHE HAS FORGOTTEN IT FOR THE MOMENT EXCUSE ME IF I JOIN HER
THAT HAD BEEN A SQUARE SHEET WHICH EVEN IF FOLDED WOULD FAIL TO ENTER THIS LONG AND NARROW ENVELOPE THE INTEREST WHICH I HAD FELT WHEN I THOUGHT THE TWO IDENTICAL WAS A FALSE INTEREST YET I COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THIS SCRAP HAD A VALUE OF ITS OWN
LET THEM COME HERE AND SEE THIS MORNING I SHALL ISSUE INVITATIONS FOR A DINNER TO BE GIVEN THE FIRST NIGHT YOU CAN ASSURE ME MISTER PACKARD WILL BE AT HOME DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SUCH NIGHT ON FRIDAY WEEK
IF IT BRINGS ME WHAT IT OUGHT TO
AS IF AFRAID OF BETRAYING A TREMOR IN HIS RIGIDLY DRAWN UP FIGURE WAS THERE THE IMPEDIMENT OF A FORMER MARRIAGE NO ANSWER FROM THE STERNLY SET LIPS OR WAS IT THAT YOU ONCE SERVED A TERM A VERY SHORT TERM CUT SHORT BY A SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
WITHDREW MY EYES FROM THE HANDSOMEST FACE I HAD EVER SEEN AND
ELLEN LOOKED ASHAMED AND WHEN I RETIRED TO THE ONE BARE PLACE I SAW IN THE BAY OF THE WINDOW MUTTERED AS SHE PLUNGED TO LIFT ONE OF THE GREAT BOXES IT'S AS BAD AS THE ATTIC ROOM UP STAIRS ALL THE TRUNKS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED ON TO THE FLOOR AND
BUT THE CAUSE AND PURPOSE OF MY PRESENCE UNDER THIS ROOF I PAUSED TO WONDER OVER THE FACT THAT THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO RESENT MY INTRUSION MOST WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK IT MOST KINDLY AND WITH LEAST TOKEN OF SURPRISE
WITH THIS I TURNED SQUARELY ABOUT AND LOOKED DIRECTLY AT HER WHOM I BELIEVED TO BE BESS A VOLUBLE ANSWER FROM THE WOMAN AT MY SIDE BUT NOT THE WINK OF AN EYE FROM THE ONE WHOSE ATTENTION I HAD ENDEAVORED TO ATTRACT
IT WAS NOT SOUND WHICH HAD DISTURBED ME THE LIBRARY BELL RANG CONTINUED THE VOICE IS IT ICE WATER YOU WANT THEN I SAW THAT IT WAS NIXON THE BUTLER AND SHOOK MY HEAD IN MINGLED ANGER AND PERPLEXITY FOR NOT ONLY HAD HE ADVANCED QUITE NOISELESSLY
THAT FEELING OF SOME KIND LAY BACK OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH SHE FEARED TO HOLD WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF ANOTHER'S SECRET PRESENCE THE CALM EVEN TONES OF THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF MODULATED TO AN EXPRESSION OF UTMOST DEFERENCE
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS DOES TO THE PHANTASM YOU PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN YOURSELF ONCE IN THIS VERY SPOT IT PROVES IT A MYTH A PRODUCT OF YOUR OWN IMAGINATION SOMETHING WHICH IT MUST CERTAINLY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU EVER TO FEAR AGAIN
I HAVE HARMED NO MAN KNOWINGLY AND AS FAR AS I KNOW NO MAN HAS EVER CHERISHED A WISH TO INJURE ME WHO CONSTITUTE YOUR HOUSEHOLD HOW MANY SERVANTS DO YOU KEEP AND HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN WITH YOU
I COULD NOT EASILY FORGET THE DRAWN LOOK ABOUT MOUTH AND EYES WHICH IN THE FIRST INSTANT OF OUR MEETING HAD DISTORTED FEATURES NATURALLY HARMONIOUS AND BEAUTIFULLY SERENE I AM SURE HER HUSBAND HAD OBSERVED IT ALSO
BUSINESS IS VERY POOR IN THIS SHOP I WAS STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER TURNING QUICKLY ABOUT I LOOKED THROUGH THE NARROW PANES OF THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT MY EYES NATURALLY RESTED ON THE STOOP OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSE
CAME ON LAST TUESDAY DIDN'T HE YES I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE DAY TOWARD AFTERNOON NO HE CAME EARLY SOON AFTER BREAKFAST IN FACT DOES YOUR WIFE LIKE HIM
YIELDED MORE AND MORE TO A SUDDEN WEAKNESS SAPPING HIS LIFE VIGOR TILL HE FELL PRONE AND APPARENTLY LIFELESS ON THE LOUNGE TOWARD WHICH
THE MAYOR GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF FEELING EITHER ITS FORCE OR ASSUMPTION
IT'S A LITTLE BOX WITH MY NAME ON IT AND IT IS HIDDEN WHERE BEHIND A BRICK I LOOSENED IN THE CELLAR WALL I CAN DESCRIBE THE VERY PLACE OH YOU THINK I AM ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU A STRANGER AND A LADY
AND I WAS SURE I CAUGHT THE NOTE OF HOPE IN HIS VOICE AS HE COURTEOUSLY REMARKED YOU ARE SEEKING A PLACE YOUNG LADY DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FILL THE ONE I HAVE TO OFFER IT HAS ITS DIFFICULTIES BUT IT IS NOT AN ONEROUS ONE
I PERCEIVED THE PIECE OF PAPER SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE DINING ROOM AND HAD DOUBTLESS DROPPED IN THE COURSE OF THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION RUNNING DOWN IN GREAT HASTE I PICKED IT UP THIS SCRAP OF I KNEW NOT WHAT
FOR THESE OLD LADIES TO MOUNT TO THE HALLS ABOVE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FOUR FOOT HOLE IN WHICH WE NOW STOOD
I THINK SO MISSUS PACKARD I AM SO GLAD HER TONE WAS ALMOST HYSTERICAL MY HEART IS SET ON THIS ELECTION SHE ARDENTLY EXPLAINED IT MEANS SO MUCH THIS YEAR
FOR THERE WERE EVIDENCES ABOUT THE HALL THAT IT WAS BEING THOROUGHLY SWEPT AS I ENDEAVORED TO PASS THE DOOR I INADVERTENTLY STRUCK THE EDGE OF A LITTLE TABORET STANDING IN MY WAY IT TOPPLED AND A LITTLE BOOK
WE ARE QUITE SURROUNDED THE HOUSE SHOULD CERTAINLY HOLD TREASURE TO WARRANT ALL THIS INTEREST BUT WHAT COULD THIS ONE TIME DOMESTIC KNOW OF THE MISSING BONDS AN OLD FASHIONED DOORWAY I REMARKED
ON ONE OF THESE BRICKS YOU WILL DETECT A CROSS SCRATCHED THAT'S THE ONE
IT IS SUCH PLEASURE TO HAVE HER AT ALL LIKE HERSELF AGAIN I LONGED TO DETAIN HIM LONGED TO PUT SOME OF THE NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS MY AWAKENED CURIOSITY DEMANDED BUT HIS IMPATIENCE WAS TOO MARKED AND I LET HIM DEPART WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY
WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
LINBOFF WHOSE BOOKS CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER CANNOT HELP HIM NOR CAN THE PILGRIMS ON CROWDED STEAMERS NOR THE VERSE
HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
ALL OF US MUST CONSIDER WHY WE ARE LIVING BY GOD WE MUST THERE IS NO SENSE IN OUR LIFE THERE IS NO SENSE AT ALL SOME ARE RICH THEY HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR A THOUSAND MEN ALL TO THEMSELVES AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT OCCUPATION OTHERS BOW THEIR BACKS IN TOIL ALL THEIR LIFE
EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
HIS NERVE CENTRES OF JUDGMENT AND WILL HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE BUT IN MAINTAINING HIS OWN SOLVENCY BY THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHERS HE TRADES UPON SORROW AND DRAWS A LIVELIHOOD FROM MISFORTUNE
WHEN CROSSING A BALLROOM FLOOR I REMEMBER ONCE ABSENTING MYSELF FROM CIVILIZATION FOR WEARY MONTHS WHEN I RETURNED IT WAS TO A STRANGE CITY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
BUT FOMA WILL HAVE NONE OF IT HE IS NEITHER TO BE ENTICED NOR CAJOLED THE CRY OF HIS NATURE IS FOR LIGHT HE MUST HAVE LIGHT AND IN BURNING REVOLT HE GOES SEEKING THE MEANING OF LIFE HIS THOUGHTS EMBRACED ALL THOSE PETTY PEOPLE WHO TOILED AT HARD LABOUR IT WAS STRANGE
THE PERSON I SOUGHT PRACTISED A PROFESSION AS ANCIENT AS THE ORACLES BUT FAR MORE LUCRATIVE IT IS MENTIONED IN EXODUS SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN CREATED SOON AFTER THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD AND DESPITE THE THUNDER OF ECCLESIASTICS AND THE
AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
BUT LUCKILY FOR MY SOUL'S WELFARE I REFLECTED AND WAS SAVED BY THE CLEARER VISION VOUCHSAFED ME I BEHELD ERASMUS FIRE FLASHING HEAVEN BORN WHILE I I WAS MERELY A CLAY BORN A SON OF EARTH
WHILE ALL CLAMOUR THAT HE DO THIS THING OR THINK THIS THING IN THE ANCIENT AND TIME HONOURED WAY
ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
PEOPLE LOOKED UPON ME SCORNFULLY PITIFULLY REPROACHFULLY I CAN SWEAR THEY DID IN EVERY EYE I READ THE QUESTION MAN WHERE ARE YOUR CABBAGES
AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
WHY DO YOU LIVE HE DEMANDS OF THE CONCLAVE OF MERCHANTS OF LIFE'S SUCCESSES YOU HAVE NOT CONSTRUCTED LIFE YOU HAVE MADE A CESSPOOL YOU HAVE DISSEMINATED FILTH AND STIFLING EXHALATIONS BY YOUR DEEDS HAVE YOU ANY CONSCIENCE DO YOU REMEMBER GOD
DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POWER FOR GOOD IN HIS LIFE SHE MIGHT HAVE SHED LIGHT INTO IT AND LIFTED HIM UP TO SAFETY AND HONOUR AND UNDERSTANDING YET SHE WENT AWAY NEXT DAY AND HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN NO STORY IS TOLD NOTHING IS FINISHED
WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH WHICH A COMBINATION BEATS DOWN TO HIS KNEES A MAN WITH A MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT A CLUB THE MAN WHO WALKS IN HIS SLEEP SAYS IT IS NOT A CLUB SO SAY ALL OF HIS KIND WITH WHICH HE HERDS THEY GATHER TOGETHER
WILL DIE ALL IN GOOD TIME IN THE COURSE OF NATURAL EVOLUTION BUT THEY WILL NOT DIE SO LONG AS THE COWARDLY SOMNAMBULISTIC APES AND TIGERS CLUB AND SCRATCH AND SLASH THIS IS NOT A BRIEF FOR THE PRIZE FIGHTER
WHY I DO NOT KNOW SAVE THAT IN SUCH WAY DID MY FATHERS BEFORE ME
FAKE ACCOUNTINGS ARE NOT FOUL BLOWS OF THE FIST UNDER THE BELT A PRESENT OF COAL STOCK BY A MINE OPERATOR TO A RAILROAD OFFICIAL
MY BRAIN WAS CLEAR AND REFRESHED THERE WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO MY ARM MY NERVES WERE TINGLING AND I WAS A PULSE WITH THE TIMES ALL MEN WERE MY BROTHERS SAVE ONE YES SAVE ONE
HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
COULD JUDGE ME BY MY CLOTHES ALONE BUT I REFUSED TO BE SO JUDGED MY SPIRITUAL BACKBONE STIFFENED AND I HELD MY HEAD HIGH LOOKING ALL MEN IN THE EYES AND I DID THESE THINGS NOT THAT I WAS AN EGOTIST
DANCING THE DANCE OF DEATH GROPING FOR THE NAMELESS INDEFINITE SOMETHING THE MAGIC FORMULA THE ESSENCE THE INTRINSIC FACT THE FLASH OF LIGHT THROUGH THE MURK AND DARK THE RATIONAL SANCTION FOR EXISTENCE IN SHORT FOMA GORDYEEFF GOES DOWN TO MADNESS AND DEATH
THAT A MAN OF LEAD HE ONCE REMARKED WHO HAS NO MORE SENSE THAN A LOG OF WOOD AND IS AS BAD AS HE IS FOOLISH SHOULD HAVE MANY WISE AND GOOD MEN TO SERVE HIM
THE RESULT OF THIS ADMIXTURE OF THE REAL AND THE UNREAL IS CONFUSION THRICE CONFOUNDED THE MAN THAT WALKS THE REAL WORLD IN HIS SLEEP BECOMES SUCH A TANGLED MASS OF CONTRADICTIONS PARADOXES AND LIES
IT REQUIRES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STICK TO SCRAPE IT OFF THE RAW ANIMALS BENEATH ARE IDENTICAL BUT INTRUDE NOT VIOLENTLY UPON MAN LEAVE HIM ALONE IN HIS SOMNAMBULISM AND HE KICKS OUT FROM UNDER HIS FEET THE LADDER OF LIFE
I APOLOGIZE
UNCONSCIOUSLY LEAVING HIS HAND DIRECTLY POINTED AT HALE JUNE HESITATED AND RUFE LEANED ONE ELBOW ON THE TABLE AND THE LIGHT IN HIS EYES BEAT WITH FIERCE INTENSITY INTO THE GIRL'S EYES
HE PRODUCED A WITNESS THE MOUNTAIN LOUT WHOM HALE REMEMBERED WHO ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BLOWN THE WHISTLE GIVEN THE YELL AND FIRED THE PISTOL SHOT WHEN ASKED HIS REASON THE WITNESS WHO WAS STUPID HAD NONE READY LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT RUFE
THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
THE ENGLISH WERE BUYING LANDS RIGHT AND LEFT AT THE GAP SIXTY MILES SOUTHWEST TWO COMPANIES HAD PURCHASED MOST OF THE TOWN SITE WHERE HE WAS HIS TOWN SITE AND WERE GOING TO POOL THEIR HOLDINGS AND FORM AN IMPROVEMENT COMPANY
SAID HALE JACK BLEW HE HAD HIS RIGHT SHOULDER AGAINST THE CORNER OF HIS DOOR AT THE TIME AND WHEN HE RAISED THE WHISTLE TO HIS LIPS HALE DREW AND COVERED HIM BEFORE HE COULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVE WOODS BACKED SLOWLY INTO HIS SALOON
TO THE FARTHEST LIMITS OF THE WORLD EVEN OUT THERE HALE HAD TOLD HER SHE WOULD GO SOME DAY THE LAST CURVING UP SWEEP CAME FINALLY AND THERE STOOD THE BIG PINE MAJESTIC UNCHANGED
HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
YOU'LL LET ME WATCH OUT FOR HER THERE SURE I'LL BE VERY GRATEFUL NOT AT ALL SIR NOT AT ALL IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURE AND I THINK I'LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN HE LOOKED AT JUNE
HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AS THOUGH SHE WERE ALREADY THREATENING HER BAD UNCLE WITH WHAT HALE WOULD DO TO HIM AND SHE WAS SO SERIOUS AND TRUSTFUL THAT HALE WAS CURIOUSLY TOUCHED BY AND BY HE LIFTED ONE FLAP OF HIS SADDLE POCKETS AGAIN
BUSY WITH THE WORK THAT SHE COULD DO IN THAT WORLD FOR WHICH SHE FELT SHE WAS BORN SWIFTLY SHE DID THE MORNING CHORES AND THEN SHE SAT ON THE PORCH THINKING AND WAITING SPINNING WHEEL LOOM AND DARNING NEEDLE WERE TO LIE IDLE THAT DAY
NO SAID JUNE FIERCELY WELL YOU NEEDN'T GIT MAD ABOUT IT
AND WHENEVER HE DID SPEAK SHE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S ALL OVER JUNY THEY'VE BEAT US ON EVERY TURN THEY'VE GOT US ONE BY ONE THAR AIN'T BUT A FEW OF US LEFT NOW AND WHEN I GIT UP IF I EVER DO
AND HER STEP MOTHER AND DAVE AND YET SHE FELT VAGUELY TROUBLED THE VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS IN DAZZLING SUNSHINE SHE HAD SEEN THAT THE SUN MUST STILL BE SHINING OVER THERE IT MUST BE SHINING ABOVE HER OVER HERE
AND WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH IT JUNE'S GARDEN THE GARDEN HE HAD PLANNED AND PLANTED FOR JUNE THAT THEY HAD TENDED TOGETHER AND APART AND THAT THANKS TO THE OLD MILLER'S CARE
SEEMED TO MEAN NOTHING ELSE THAN CLOSE PERSONAL COMMUNION WITH OLD NICK HIMSELF PASSING THE DOOR OF HIS SALOON ONE DAY BOB SAW ONE OF JACK'S CUSTOMERS TRYING TO PLAY POOL WITH A WINCHESTER IN ONE HAND
OR A WOMAN WITH A BABY IN HER LAP AND TWO MORE CHILDREN BEHIND ALL DRESSED IN HOMESPUN OR STORE CLOTHES AND THE PAINT FROM ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS ON HER HAT STREAKING THE FACE OF EVERY GIRL WHO HAD UNWISELY SCANNED THE HEAVENS THAT MORNING
AND COME TO THE RELENTLESS MAN IN FRONT OF HER
BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
KEEP YO MOUTH PLUM SHUT ABOUT THIS HERE WAR I'M JESTICE OF THE PEACE
HE WAS ON GUARD AGAIN THE LITTLE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED FOR THE AFTERNOON SESSION INSIDE THE RAILING SAT RUFE TOLLIVER WHITE AND DEFIANT MANACLED LEANING ON THE RAILING TO ONE SIDE WAS THE RED FOX WITH HIS BIG PISTOLS
HE WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE AS THE RED FOX OF THE MOUNTAINS
QUOTH THE HON SAM AND HE LOOKED SHARPLY AT JACK THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES AS THE TWO LED THE MAN OFF TO THE CALABOOSE FOR HE SUSPECTED THAT THE SALOON KEEPER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRICK JACK'S TIME CAME ONLY THE NEXT DAY
A LITTLE BROWN HAND HAD WHACKED HIM ACROSS THE MOUTH AND THE GIRL FLASHED INDOORS WITHOUT A WORD BUB GOT TO HIS FEET HOWLING WITH PAIN AND RAGE AND STARTED AFTER HER BUT THE OLD MAN CAUGHT HIM
HE SWALLOWED A CUP OF COFFEE SO HASTILY THAT IT BURNED HIM AND JUNE WHEN SHE PASSED HIS WINDOW ON HER WAY TO SCHOOL SAW HIM BUSY OVER HIS DESK SHE STARTED TO SHOUT TO HIM BUT HE LOOKED SO HAGGARD AND GRIM THAT SHE WAS AFRAID
AND THE BOY STEPPED IN AND HALTED
BUT A GOOD DEAL WAS LEFT AND STRAIGHTWAY HALE GOT A MAP FROM HIS OFFICE AND WITH IT IN HIS HAND WALKED DOWN THE CURVE OF THE RIVER AND OVER POPLAR HILL AND BEYOND EARLY BREAKFAST WAS READY WHEN HE GOT BACK TO THE HOTEL
I KNOW SAID HALE THERE'S TIME ENOUGH YET THEN HE WENT TO HIS ROOM PULLED THE BLINDS DOWN AND WENT TO SLEEP WHILE RUMOUR PLAYED WITH HIS NAME THROUGH THE TOWN
HIT'S MY STEP MAMMY I'M A GOIN TO KETCH HELL NOW HER INNOCENT EYES TURNED SULLEN AND HER BABY MOUTH TIGHTENED GOOD LORD SAID THE FISHERMAN STARTLED AND THEN HE STOPPED THE WORDS WERE AS INNOCENT ON HER LIPS AS A BENEDICTION
AND THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK HE ROSE TO GO TO IT AND LOOK WITHIN AND THEN DROPPED HEAVILY BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY NOW TO GET TO WORK SEVERAL TIMES HE ROSE RESTLESSLY AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW
SWEAR HER JUNE LIFTED HER RIGHT HAND PUT HER LIPS TO THE SOILED OLD BLACK BIBLE AND FACED THE JURY AND HALE AND BAD RUFE TOLLIVER WHOSE BLACK EYES NEVER LEFT HER FACE WHAT IS YOUR NAME
TO STICK TO HER PEOPLE AND DO THE BEST SHE COULD WITH HER LIFE AND NOW AND THEN THROUGH THE NIGHT OLD JUDD WOULD OPEN HIS EYES AND STARE AT THE CEILING AND AT THESE TIMES IT WAS NOT THE PAIN IN HIS FACE THAT DISTRESSED HER AS MUCH AS THE DRAWN BEATEN LOOK
BUT THE PINKS WERE FRAGRANT THE POPPIES WERE POISED ON SLENDER STALKS LIKE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES AT REST THE HOLLYHOCKS SHOOK SOUNDLESS PINK BELLS TO THE WIND ROSES AS SCARLET AS JUNE'S LIPS BLOOMED EVERYWHERE
SHE WAS LOOKING DOWN SHYLY AND SHE DID NOT SEEM MUCH PLEASED THEY ARE KINFOLKS O MINE TOO SHE SAID
I THOUGHT YE WAS GREAT FRIENDS THE LITTLE GIRL ROSE HASTILY
TIME WINGS SLOWLY FOR THE YOUNG AND WHEN THE SENSATIONS ARE MANY AND THE EXPERIENCES ARE NEW SLOWLY EVEN FOR ALL AND THUS THERE WAS A DOUBLE REASON WHY IT SEEMED AN AGE TO JUNE SINCE HER EYES HAD LAST RESTED ON THE BIG PINE
SUPPOSE WE LET HIM GO HOME ALL RIGHT SAID LOGAN THE CALABOOSE OR HOME WILL YOU GO HOME
SET DOWN BOY SARVED YOU RIGHT FER BLABBIN THINGS THAT HAIN'T YO BUSINESS HE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER JEALOUSY GREAT HEAVENS HALE THOUGHT IN THAT CHILD AND FOR HIM
AND THEN SLIPPING DOWN PAST HER CHEEK TO CLENCH THE OTHER TIGHTLY
THEN HE POINTED TO THE SMALLER ONE AND SPOKE TO HALE WITHOUT LOOKING AROUND WHY THAT LITTLE SKATE THERE WAS TEASING THIS LITTLE GIRL AND SHE SLAPPED HIM SAID HALE GRIMLY THE LAD WITH THE CAP TURNED
WHEN SHE REACHED THE MILLER'S CABIN SHE WENT TO THE PORCH WITHOUT NOTICING THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
I'VE GOT SOME CANDY HERE FOR A NICE LITTLE GIRL HE SAID AS THOUGH THE SUBJECT HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S FOR YOU WON'T YOU HAVE SOME I RECKON I WILL SHE SAID WITH A HAPPY SMILE
FOR IT HUNG BELOW HER WAIST AND WAS MUCH LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS AT SCHOOL THE TRANSITION WAS EASY NOW SO INTERESTED HAD SHE BECOME SHE GOT OUT HER TAN SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND THE PRETTY WHITE DRESS AND PUT THEM ON THE MILLPOND
APPREHENSIVE THAT THEIR OBJECT IS TO FIND OUT WHERE THREE OR FOUR OF THEM COULD SEE ME LATER I SEE BUT FEW CIRCASSIAN WOMEN WHAT FEW I APPROACH SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO OBSERVE ARE ALL MORE OR LESS PLEASANT FACED
AND THE ENDS TIED TOGETHER OVER THE HEAD SUFFICIENTLY TIGHT TO PREVENT THEM OPENING THEIR EYES FALCONING IS CONSIDERED THE CHIEF OUT DOOR SPORT OF THE PERSIAN NOBILITY
FINALLY WHILE MAKING THE BEST OF BREAD AND WATER WHICH IS HARDLY MADE MORE PALATABLE BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE PEOPLE WATCHING ME FEED A WOMAN IN AN AIRY FAIRY COSTUME THAT IS LITTLE BETTER THAN NO COSTUME AT ALL COMES FORWARD AND CONTRIBUTES A SMALL BOWL OF YAORT
AND BOWLING BRISKLY ALONG THE RIGHT ROAD WITHIN THEIR RANGE OF VISION FOR OVER A MILE
TO SOMETHING AKIN TO A FREE CIRCUS FOR CROWDS OF BARELEGGED RYOTS I SOON DISCOVER THAT WITH CHARACTERISTIC PERSIAN TRUTHFULNESS HE HAS LIKEWISE BEEN SPREADING THE INTERESTING REPORT
THEY CHAT AND WHILE AWAY THE DREARY DAYS OF WINTER AT THE THIRD VILLAGE AFTER LEAVING THE SONS OF THE PASHA KHAN MY TARTAR EYED ESCORT WITH MUCH GARRULOUS INJUNCTION TO HIS SUCCESSOR
I PROCEED TO BUFFALO NEXT MORNING CATCHING THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THAT IMPORTANT SEAPORT OF THE LAKES WHERE FIFTEEN MILES ACROSS THE BAY THE WAGON ROAD IS ALMOST LICKED BY THE SWASHING WAVES AND ENTERING THE CITY OVER A MISFIT PLANK ROAD
I WAS GRATIFIED TO LEARN FROM THE PERSIAN CONSUL AT ERZEROUM THAT MY STOCK OF TURKISH WOULD ANSWER ME AS FAR AS TEHERAN
AT DAYLIGHT I AM AGAIN ON THE MOVE AND SUNRISE FINDS ME BUSY MAKING AN OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE THAT OCCUPIES I SHOULD IMAGINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPREGNABLE POSITIONS IN ALL ASIA MINOR
THIS DOUBTLESS COMES OF THE PURE CONTRARINESS OF HUMAN NATURE IN THE ABSENCE OF SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS THEIR RELIGION TEACHES THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY OUGHT TO BATHE EVERY DAY CONSEQUENTLY THEY NEVER BATHE AT ALL
AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE CIRCASSIANS BETRAY MORE INTEREST IN MY PURELY PERSONAL AFFAIRS WHETHER I AM RUSSIAN OR ENGLISH WHITHER I AM BOUND ET CETERA AND LESS INTEREST IN THE BICYCLE THAN EITHER TURKS OR ARMENIANS
WHICH EMBRACES BOTH PERSIAN AND TURKISH TERRITORY AND THE OCCASION IS MOST OPPORTUNE FOR SEEING SOMETHING OF THESE WILD NOMADS IN THEIR OWN MOUNTAIN PASTURES THE GREENSWARD IS RIDABLE AND I
AND APPEARS ANXIOUS TO ATONE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LITTLE INCIVILITY OF YESTERDAY EVENING AND TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS I MAY PERCHANCE ENTERTAIN OF HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT BEFORE I LEAVE
AND WELL WORN CAMEL PATHS AFFORD SOME EXCELLENT WHEELING NEAR MID DAY WHILE LABORIOUSLY ASCENDING A LONG BUT NOT ALTOGETHER UNRIDABLE ASCENT I MEET A COUPLE OF MOUNTED SOLDIERS
FROM OCCUPYING THEIR DEARLY BELOVED STAMBOUL ITSELF THEIR ADMIRATION KNOWS NO BOUNDS ALONG THE TRAIL NOT OVER A MILE FROM CAMP A LARGE PERSIAN CARAVAN
JUDGING FROM THE SOUNDS THEY APPEAR TO BE MAKING A BEE LINE FOR MY POSITION BUT NOT CARING TO VOLUNTARILY REVEAL MY PRESENCE I SIMPLY REMAIN QUIET AND LISTEN IT SOON BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE A PARTY OF VILLAGERS
ORDERING A SERVANT TO BRING A TALLOW CANDLE SO THAT I CAN HAVE NO EXCUSE THERE APPEARS TO BE SUCH A TOTAL ABSENCE OF ALL CONSIDERATION FOR MYSELF THAT I AM NOT DISPOSED TO REGARD VERY FAVORABLY OR PATIENTLY
AT THE SAME TIME MAKING NO PRETENCE OF CONCEALING THEIR EAGER CURIOSITY CONCERNING THE PROBABLE CONTENTS OF MY LUGGAGE NATURALLY DISAPPROVING OF THIS ARBITRARY CONDUCT
THE SERVANT WHO PRESENTS MY LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FILLS THE UNTUTORED MIND OF HIS MASTER WITH WONDERMENT CONCERNING WHAT THE PEASANTS HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE BICYCLE THE PASHA KHAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE TROUBLE
TAWNY COATED MONSTERS LARGER THAN THE LARGEST MASTIFFS WHO NOW PROCEED TO MAKE THINGS LIVELY AND INTERESTING AROUND MYSELF AND THE BICYCLE KEEPING THE REVOLVER IN MY HAND
THE PERSIANS ACCOMPANYING HER COMPRISE HER OWN SERVANTS SOME SOLDIERS PROCURED OF THE GOVERNOR OF TABREEZ BY THE ENGLISH CONSUL TO
APPEAR OVER THE SLOPE ACCOMPANIED BY ABOUT A DOZEN PERSIANS IF I AM SURPRISED THE LADY HERSELF NOT UNNATURALLY EVINCES EVEN GREATER ASTONISHMENT
ON A STONE BRIDGE I FOLLOW ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE HEAD WATERS OF OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE KIZIL IRMAK
PROM ANGORA I HAVE BROUGHT A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO MISTER ERNEST WEAKLEY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN ENGAGED TOGETHER WITH MISTER KODIGAS A BELGIAN GENTLEMAN
BUT FUEL IS AS SCARCE AS IN ASIA MINOR AND LIKE THE TURKS AND ARMENIANS IN WINTER THEY HAVE RESOURCE TO A PECULIAR AND ECONOMICAL ARRANGEMENT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
BEFORE THEY RECOVER FROM THEIR FIRST ASTONISHMENT I HAVE DISAPPEARED THE ROAD CONTINUES FOR THE MOST PART RIDABLE UNTIL ABOUT TWO P M WHEN I ARRIVE AT A MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF ROCKY RIDGES COVERED CHIEFLY WITH A GROWTH OF SCRUB OAK
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
BUT UNFORTUNTAELY THIS IS OLD YAORT YAORT THAT IS IN THE SERE AND YELLOW STAGE OF ITS USEFULNESS AS HUMAN FOOD AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE DOUBTLESS CONSUME IT THUS I PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND LESS ODORIFEROUS TURNS UP
IS POPULARLY BELIEVED BY MANY OF ITS NUMEROUS LOCAL ADMIRERS TO BE THE HIGHEST NAVIGABLE LAKE IN THE WORLD IF SO HOWEVER LAKE TAHOE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS COMES NEXT
SURELY THIS YOUNGSTER'S HEAD OUGHT TO BE LEVEL ON AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS WHEN HE GROWS UP IF ANYBODY'S OUGHT FROM NAPOLEON MY ROUTE LEADS UP THE MAUMEE RIVER AND CANAL FIRST TRYING THE TOW PATH OF THE LATTER AND THEN RELINQUISHING IT FOR
TO A BOX OF BOOKS AND PERMIT ITS TRANSPORTATION THROUGH THE COUNTRY ON CONDITION IF THEY WILL THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED IN TRANSIT SURELY THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER OF THE PEOPLE'S MINDS BEING ENLIGHTENED
AN APPEAL TO THE REVOLVER WILL INVARIABLY SECURE MY RELEASE BUT ONE NATURALLY GETS ASHAMED OF THREATENING PEOPLE'S LIVES EVEN UNDER THE EXASPERATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A FORCIBLE DETENTION
THE WOMAN A CRIMSON CRESTED BLONDE JOGS SERENELY ALONG WITHOUT EVEN DEIGNING TO TURN HER HEAD LEAVING THE BICYCLE AT ISHAM'S WHO VOLUNTEERS SOME SLIGHT REPAIRS
VANISHES LIKE A DEER IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS COMPANIONS IT IS AN UNENVIABLE SITUATION TO FIND ONE'S SELF IN IF I BOLDLY APPROACH THEM THESE PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO ASCERTAIN MY CHARACTER IN THE MOONLIGHT
WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH HIS WONDERFUL ARABA WILL BECOME A RED LETTER EVENT IN THE MEMORY OF THE PEOPLE ALONG MY ROUTE THROUGH ASIA MINOR
AND SEEM ALTOGETHER OF A MORE RESERVED DISPOSITION I GENERALLY HAVE AS LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH THEM AS POSSIBLE CONFINING MYSELF TO LETTING THEM KNOW I AM ENGLISH AND NOT RUSSIAN AND REPLYING TURKCHI BINMUS I DON'T UNDERSTAND TO OTHER QUESTIONS
A WAGON ROAD HAVING BEEN MADE FROM SIVAS INTO THIS FOREST TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE TO HAUL WOOD AND BUILDING TIMBER ON THEIR ARABAS ARRIVING AT A GOOD SIZED AND COMPARATIVELY WELL TO DO MUSSULMAN VILLAGE
THE AFFRIGHTED KATIR JEE'S FIRST IMPULSE IS TO SEEK REFUGE IN FLIGHT NOT INFREQUENTLY BOLTING CLEAR OFF THE ROADWAY BEFORE VENTURING UPON TAKING A SECOND LOOK SOMETIMES I SIMPLY PUT ON A SPURT AND WHISK PAST AT A FIFTEEN MILE PACE
IS PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE TO EVERYBODY IN THE COMPARTMENT AND THEY BECOME HIGHLY INTERESTED AND AMUSED AND COMMENCE LOOKING AT ME FOR AN EXPLANATION WITH A VIEW TO HUMORING THE SPIRIT OF AMUSEMENT THUS AWAKENED
OF OUR ANCESTRESS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND OVER THIS THEY HASTILY DON A FLIMSY SHAWL LIKE GARMENT TO COME OUT AND SEE ME RIDE THEY ARE ALWAYS MUCH LESS CONCERNED ABOUT CONCEALING THEIR NETHER EXTREMITIES
I TAKE A FLYING VISIT BY RAIL TO SEE NIAGARA FALLS RETURNING THE SAME EVENING TO ENJOY THE PROFFERED HOSPITALITY OF A GENIAL MEMBER OF THE BUFFALO BICYCLE CLUB
ONCE OR TWICE THE OWNER OF THE COVERLET APPROACHES QUIETLY JUST NEAR ENOUGH TO ASCERTAIN THAT I AM NOT INTENDING MAKING OFF WITH HIS PROPERTY BUT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER OF BEING DISTURBED OR MOLESTED IN ANY WAY TILL MORNING
ONCE TO DAY I MANAGED TO OUTWIT THEM BEAUTIFULLY PRETENDING ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR PROPOSITION OF WAITING TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR KHAN I PROPOSE MOUNTING AND RIDING A FEW YARDS FOR THEIR OWN EDIFICATION WHILE WAITING
WE COULD SEE THAT IT WIDENED AND SPREAD OUT IN A MYRIAD OF CHANNELS RUSHING BY ISOLATED CLUMPS OF SEDGE AND MATETE GRASS AND THAT IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A SWAMP WE HAD ASCENDED THE CENTRAL OR MAIN CHANNEL THE WESTERN CHANNEL WAS ABOUT EIGHT YARDS BROAD
I AM OBLIGED TO THINK THEM NATURAL ANOTHER THING WHICH SPECIALLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WAS HIS WONDERFULLY RETENTIVE MEMORY IF WE REMEMBER THE MANY YEARS HE HAS SPENT IN AFRICA DEPRIVED OF BOOKS
THE DOCTOR CALMLY ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THE SHEEP AND GOATS ESPECIALLY THE FORMER ARE ALWAYS IN GOOD CONDITION AND THOUGH THEY ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH ENGLISH OR AMERICAN SHEEP THEY ARE THE FINEST I HAVE SEEN IN AFRICA NUMEROUS VILLAGES ARE SEEN ON THIS LAND BECAUSE THE INTERVENING SPACES
WITH HIS USUAL KINDNESS HE STAYED AT THIS CHIEF'S VILLAGE TO TREAT HIS MALADY
IS DETERRED FROM BESTIRRING HIMSELF TO PROVE THEM BY THE TEST OF EXPLORATION HIS OPINION OF SUCH A MAN IS THAT HE UNFITS HIMSELF FOR HIS DUTY
ON ONE SIDE IS MUTUMBI PROBABLY THE UTUMBI OF SPEKE AND BAKER
AND OVERLAPPING IT ON THE NORTH SIDE AS FAR AS THE HILLS OF CHAMATI WAS RUWENGA ALSO A COUNTRY GOVERNED BY MUKAMBA BEYOND RUWENGA FROM THE HILLS OF CHAMATI TO THE RUANDA RIVER WAS THE COUNTRY OF CHAMATI
BETWEEN A NOISY VINDICTIVE LOOKING SET OF NATIVES OF THE ONE PART AND OUR PEOPLE OF THE OTHER PART SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN REFUGE BEHIND THE CANOE AND HAD THEIR LOADED GUNS HALF POINTING AT THE PASSIONATE MOB WHICH WAS MOMENTARILY INCREASING IN NUMBERS
AND CONSEQUENT ANNOYANCE FOR A FEW HOURS WHEN BEING RESTED WE MIGHT CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY OUR KETTLE WAS BOILING FOR TEA AND THE MEN HAD BUILT A LITTLE FIRE FOR THEMSELVES AND HAD FILLED THEIR BLACK EARTHEN POT WITH WATER FOR PORRIDGE
THESE ARE THE SCENES WHICH REVEAL THEMSELVES TO US
HIS MAPS ALSO EVINCE GREAT CARE AND INDUSTRY AS TO THE REPORT OF HIS AFRICAN MARRIAGE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MORE THAN THAT IT IS UNTRUE AND IT IS UTTERLY BENEATH A GENTLEMAN
WHILE THE DOCTOR AND I WERE ARRIVING AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE MOVEMENTS WERE PRELIMINARY TO OR SIGNIFICANT OF HOSTILITY A FOURTH BODY VERY BOISTEROUS AND LOUD CAME AND VISITED US OUR SUPPER HAD BEEN BY THIS TIME DESPATCHED AND WE THOUGHT IT HIGH TIME TO ACT
AND REDUCING TO NIL THE FRUITS OF LONG YEARS OF LABOR BY SHARPLY POINTED SHAFTS OF RIDICULE AND SNEERS
AND NUMBERS OF PUNCH LYING ON THE FLOOR WELL
AND MUGIHEWA WAS MADE OUT TO BE IN THREE DEGREES NINETEEN MINUTES S LATITUDE ON THE SEVENTH DECEMBER EARLY IN THE MORNING WE LEFT MUGIHEWA AND ROWING PAST THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE KATANGARA ISLANDS
YET LIVINGSTONE'S MIND CAN FIND PLEASURE AND FOOD FOR PHILOSOPHIC STUDIES THE WONDERS OF PRIMEVAL NATURE THE GREAT FORESTS AND SUBLIME MOUNTAINS THE PERENNIAL STREAMS AND SOURCES OF THE GREAT LAKES THE MARVELS OF THE EARTH
THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR LIFE AT UJIJI I KNEW HIM NOT AS A FRIEND BEFORE MY ARRIVAL HE WAS ONLY AN OBJECT TO ME A GREAT ITEM FOR A DAILY NEWSPAPER
SUCH MEN NATURALLY MADE BUT A POOR ESCORT FOR HAD THE PARTY BEEN ATTACKED BY A WANDERING TRIBE OF NATIVES OF ANY STRENGTH THE DOCTOR COULD HAVE MADE NO DEFENCE AND NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO HIM BUT TO SURRENDER AND BE RUINED
IF A MAN'S CHARACTER WAS OF THAT OBLIQUE NATURE THAT IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO TRAVEL IN HIS COMPANY I HAVE SEEN MEN IN WHOSE COMPANY I FELT NOTHING BUT A THRALDOM
I HAD DISCOVERED LIVINGSTONE AND I WAS IN HIS HOUSE I LISTENED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DAWNING ON ME MIGHT BE CONFIRMED BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE I HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SULLEN ROAR OF THE SURF
AND INDULGENT OF MASTERS A MAN WHOSE SOCIETY IS PLEASURABLE IN LIVINGSTONE I HAVE SEEN MANY AMIABLE TRAITS HIS GENTLENESS NEVER FORSAKES HIM HIS HOPEFULNESS NEVER DESERTS HIM
AND THE EFFORT TO GNAW AT THE CORN EARS HAD LOOSENED ALL HIS TEETH I PREFERRED THE CORN SCONES OF VIRGINIA WHICH TO MY MIND WERE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PALATABLE BREAD OBTAINABLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
DISCLOSED ITSELF BETWEEN THE SERRATED TOPS OF THE FRONT LINE OF MOUNTAINS WHICH ROSE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LAKE WITHIN THE FOLDS OF THE FRONT LINE OF MOUNTAINS RISE ISOLATED HILLS OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE
THE COUNTRY OF RUHINGA MUKAMBA'S ELDER BROTHER IN LOOKING BACK TO WHERE WE HAD COME FROM WE PERCEIVED THAT WE HAD MADE A DIAGONAL CUT ACROSS FROM SOUTH EAST TO NORTH WEST INSTEAD OF HAVING MADE A DIRECT EAST AND WEST COURSE OR IN OTHER WORDS
AND THROUGH THIS VALLEY THE RUSIZI FLOWS TOWARDS THE LAKE
THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THIS SUPPOSED CONNECTION AND DECLARE YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN SETTLE IT IF I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE TO YOU YOU MAY COMMAND ME THOUGH I DID NOT COME TO AFRICA AS AN EXPLORER
THAT THE PEOPLE WISHED US TO LEAVE AS THEY WERE ON HOSTILE TERMS WITH THE ARABS BECAUSE THE ELDEST SON OF THE SULTAN OF MUZIMU THE LARGE ISLAND NEARLY OPPOSITE
UPON WHOM WE NOW LOOKED DOWN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MOCHA COFFEE AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY WITH CALM CONTEMPT NOT UNMIXED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPASSION THE DOCTOR RELATED SOME EXPERIENCES HE HAD HAD AMONG PEOPLE OF SIMILAR DISPOSITION
WE HAD COME TO MUGIHEWA SITUATED AT THE NORTHERNMOST POINT OF THE WESTERN SHORE
ACCORDINGLY WE HAD OUR BREAKFAST COOKED AND AS USUAL LAID DOWN FOR AN AFTERNOON NAP I SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WAS DREAMING AWAY IN MY TENT IN HAPPY OBLIVION OF THE STRIFE AND CONTENTION THAT HAD RISEN SINCE I HAD GONE TO SLEEP WHEN I HEARD A VOICE HAILING ME WITH
IN SIZE IT WAS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE MALAGARAZI RIVER NEITHER IS IT OR CAN IT BE NAVIGABLE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE SMALLEST CANOES
BESIDES SAID I THERE ARE TWO OR THREE COWARDLY CREATURES IN THE BOAT WHO IN CASE OF ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WOULD NOT SCRUPLE TO LEAVE BOTH OF US HERE FROM CAPE LUVUMBA
THEY HAD RECOURSE TO THE WILD FRUITS WHICH SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FURNISHED AT INTERVALS THE CONDITION OF THE HARD PRESSED BAND WAS MADE WORSE BY THE HEARTLESS DESERTION OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS
WE KEPT ON OUR WAY UNTIL WE CAME TO MUREMBWE POINT WHICH BEING A DELTA OF A RIVER OF THE SAME NAME
THAT RUGGED FRAME OF HIS ENCLOSED A YOUNG AND MOST EXUBERANT SOUL EVERY DAY I HEARD INNUMERABLE JOKES AND PLEASANT ANECDOTES INTERESTING HUNTING STORIES IN WHICH HIS FRIENDS OSWELL WEBB VARDON AND GORDEN CUMMING
THIS IS MY BELIEF BASED UPON REPORTS OF THE ARABS AND A TEST I MADE OF THE FLOW WITH WATER PLANTS BUT
AND HE WAS NOT A WHIT ABASHED WHEN THROUGH HIM THE CHIEF TOLD US THAT THE RUSIZI JOINED BY THE RUANDA OR LUANDA AT A DISTANCE OF TWO DAYS JOURNEY BY WATER OR ONE DAY BY LAND FROM THE HEAD OF THE LAKE FLOWED INTO THE LAKE
WE MUSTERED TEN STRONG PADDLERS AND SET OUT TO EXPLORE THE HEAD OF THE LAKE AND THE MOUTH OF THE RUSIZI WE FOUND THAT THE NORTHERN HEAD OF THE LAKE WAS INDENTED WITH SEVEN BROAD BAYS EACH FROM ONE AND A HALF TO THREE MILES BROAD
BUT THE ADVANCE OF THE EXPEDITION WAS OFTEN RETARDED BY THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE SEPOYS AND JOHANNA MEN TO WORK SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE EXPEDITION FROM THE COAST
FOR MILES LIVINGSTONE AND HIS PARTY HAD TO CUT THEIR WAY WITH THEIR AXES THROUGH THE DENSE AND ALMOST IMPENETRABLE JUNGLES WHICH LINED THE RIVER'S BANKS THE ROAD WAS A MERE FOOTPATH LEADING IN THE MOST ERRATIC FASHION INTO AND THROUGH THE DENSE VEGETATION
WITNESSED HIS CONDUCT IN THE CAMP AND ON THE MARCH AND MY FEELINGS FOR HIM ARE THOSE OF UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
WERE ABLE TO PROCEED EASILY ENOUGH BUT THE CAMELS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ENORMOUS HEIGHT COULD NOT ADVANCE A STEP WITHOUT THE AXES OF THE PARTY CLEARING THE WAY THESE TOOLS OF FORESTERS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS REQUIRED
ALMOST HIDDEN IN TALL REEDS AND DISEMBARKED FOR THE NIGHT COGNIZANT OF THE DANGERS WHICH SURROUNDED US KNOWING THAT SAVAGE AND IMPLACABLE MAN WAS THE WORST ENEMY WE HAD TO FEAR
HE HAD HEARD THAT THE WHITE MAN HAD COME TO LOOK FOR WATERS FOR RIVERS AND SEAS THOUGH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHITE MAN COULD WANT WITH SUCH THINGS HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE OBJECT WAS GOOD
I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT LIVINGSTONE POSSESSED A SPLENETIC MISANTHROPIC TEMPER SOME HAVE SAID THAT HE IS GARRULOUS THAT HE IS DEMENTED THAT HE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED FROM THE DAVID LIVINGSTONE WHOM PEOPLE KNEW AS THE REVEREND MISSIONARY
BUT BY GOING ABOUT MY BUSINESS
HE IS A VERY FINE EXAMPLE OF THE PERSEVERANCE DOGGEDNESS AND TENACITY WHICH CHARACTERISE THE ANGLO SAXON SPIRIT
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
AND HE BEGAN THE DAY WITH A FLATLY EXPRESSED DETERMINATION THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO LET FELICITY RULE THE ROOST IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT DAY AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IT RAINED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
THE STORY GIRL DOES PENANCE TEN DAYS LATER AUNT OLIVIA AND UNCLE ROGER WENT TO TOWN ONE EVENING TO REMAIN OVER NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY PETER AND THE STORY GIRL WERE TO STAY AT UNCLE ALEC'S DURING THEIR ABSENCE WE WERE IN THE ORCHARD AT SUNSET
IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
I MUST HEAR THAT MISSIONARY SPEAK
WHILE FELICITY AND CECILY WERE IN THEIR PRETTY MUSLINS AND SHE HAD TIED HER HAIR WITH A SNUFF BROWN RIBBON WHICH WAS VERY UNBECOMING TO HER THE FIRST PERSON WE SAW IN THE CHURCH PORCH WAS MISSUS RAY
THE WILD COLD SPRAY BEAT ON HIS EYES AND BLINDED HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER DEAFENED HIM SO THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HE FELT KEENLY THE WOUNDS AND BRUISES OF THE CRUEL ROCKS
AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE SPRANG UP IN A SHOWER OF DIAMOND FIRE BUT UNDER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE ROLLED A TERRIBLE FLOOD DEEP AND WIDE AND VIOLENT FULL OF ROCKS AND RAPIDS AND WHIRLPOOLS
AND WE ATE WHAT SEEMED GOOD UNTO US SOME OF US HAD FRIGHTFUL DREAMS AND ALL OF US CARRIED CHIPS ON OUR SHOULDERS AT BREAKFAST FELICITY AND DAN BEGAN A BICKERING WHICH THEY KEPT UP THE ENTIRE DAY FELICITY HAD A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR WHAT WE CALLED BOSSING
THOU MAYEST RETURN TO EARTH IF THOU FEAREST TO ESSAY THE FLOOD SAID THE WARDER NAY SAID VING WILDLY EARTHLY LIFE WITHOUT ALIN IS MORE DREADFUL THAN THE DEATH WHICH AWAITS ME IN YON DARK RIVER
ADDED FELICITY HER HEART MELTING AT SIGHT OF THE MISERY IN THE STORY GIRL'S PITEOUS EYES MISSUS RAY ALWAYS LOOKS ON THE DARK SIDE AND IT MAY NOT BE THE MEASLES SARA HAS AFTER ALL BUT FELICITY HAD DONE HER WORK TOO THOROUGHLY
IN WHICH NOBLE AMBITION HE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY
I BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A STORY TO TELL UNCLE ROGER HOBBLED OFF TO THE BARN STILL HOLDING ON TO HIS STOMACH DO YOU THINK HE REALLY FEELS SICK ASKED THE STORY GIRL ANXIOUSLY NO I DON'T SAID FELICITY
DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
WE ALL DECIDED TO INCREASE OUR WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION BY A CENT OR SO
THAT THEY MIGHT DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE BEYOND AND THE WARDER SET OPEN THE GATE PASS ON AND DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN HE SAID TO ALL WHO TASTE OF IT SHALL IMMORTALITY BE GIVEN
FELICITY'S SO FOND OF MAKING A FUSS OVER EVERYTHING
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE DAN BEGAN TO GET BETTER BUT FROM THAT TIME HE IMPROVED RAPIDLY WHEN THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME WHEN UNCLE ROGER REACHED MARKDALE CAME AT HALF PAST TEN HE FOUND HIS PATIENT VERY WEAK AND WHITE BUT FREE FROM PAIN
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT TO MORROW SAID THE STORY GIRL ENERGETICALLY IN FACT I'LL BEGIN TO NIGHT I'M GOING TO THE PANTRY AS SOON AS I GET HOME AND I'LL READ FATHER'S LETTER BEFORE I GO TO BED WASN'T THE MISSIONARY SPLENDID THAT CANNIBAL STORY WAS SIMPLY GRAND
THEY MADE VERY LONG PRAYERS IN THOSE DAYS YOU KNOW AND AT THE END OF HIS PRAYER HE SAID
WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
AND LET THOSE STUCK UP TORONTO BOYS GRIN LIKE CHESSY CATS BUT WHEN FELICITY LAUGHED AT HIM THE IRON ENTERED INTO PETER'S SOUL IF THE STORY GIRL LAUGHED AT PETER THE MILLS OF THE GODS GROUND OUT HIS REVENGE FOR HIM IN MID AFTERNOON
EVEN CHILDREN CANNOT DEVOUR MINCE PIE AND COLD FRIED PORK HAM AND FRUIT CAKE BEFORE GOING TO BED WITH ENTIRE IMPUNITY AUNT JANET HAD FORGOTTEN TO WARN UNCLE ROGER TO KEEP AN EYE ON OUR BEDTIME SNACKS
THE YOUNG MINISTER TURNED PALE AS THE DEAD
THE STORY GIRL WAS NOT TO BE COMFORTED I'D GIVE ANYTHING IF I'D NEVER PUT SARA UP TO GOING TO THAT SHOW SHE SAID IT'S ALL MY FAULT BUT THE PUNISHMENT FALLS ON SARA AND THAT ISN'T FAIR I'D GO THIS MINUTE AND CONFESS THE WHOLE THING TO MISSUS RAY
WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
AND AS HE DID THERE CAME RUSHING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE A GREAT COMPANY THE BAND OF FELLOW TRAVELLERS BUT ALL WERE TOO LATE TO WIN THE DOUBLE BOON VING HAD WON TO IT THROUGH THE DANGER AND SUFFERING OF THE DARK RIVER
BUT NOTHING OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY WHEN AN HOUR HAD PASSED WE CONCLUDED THAT THE BAD BERRIES WERE NOT POISON AFTER ALL AND WE LOOKED UPON DAN AS QUITE A HERO FOR DARING TO EAT THEM
MISSUS RAY NOW APPEARED LOOKING FOR SARA AND SAID SHE WOULD STAY ALL NIGHT WITH US I'LL BE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IF YOU WILL SAID UNCLE ROGER I FEEL A BIT SHOOK I URGED JANET AND ALEC TO GO TO HALIFAX
I'M GOING TO DO PENANCE ALL DAY FOR COAXING SARA TO DISOBEY HER MOTHER SHE ANNOUNCED WITH CHASTENED TRIUMPH PENANCE WE MURMURED IN BEWILDERMENT YES I'M GOING TO DENY MYSELF EVERYTHING I LIKE
AND THAT ALL OUR OLD FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN AND STRANGE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE POINTED OUT THE STARS TO US FROM THE PULPIT STONE WAS THE LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PETER SHARED OUR TOIL AND PASTIME
I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
DIRECTION IT WAS HER DUTY TO UNDO IT IF POSSIBLE AT ANY COST OF RIDICULE TO HERSELF OH FELICITY SHE SAID HER VOICE EXPRESSING A VERY ANGUISH OF HUMILIATION I
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
FELICITY PUT ON THE KETTLE DAN I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MUSTARD AND WARM WATER THE MUSTARD AND WARM WATER PRODUCED ITS PROPER EFFECT PROMPTLY BUT GAVE DAN NO RELIEF
DON'T YOU KNOW I HAVE COMPANY TO TEA
AND ATE EARLY AUGUST APPLES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE STORY GIRL SAID WE MADE HER THINK OF THE IRISHMAN'S PIG AN IRISHMAN WHO LIVED AT MARKDALE HAD A LITTLE PIG SHE SAID AND HE GAVE IT A PAILFUL OF MUSH
WE HAVEN'T ANY WHISKY SAID FELICITY DISAPPROVINGLY THIS IS A TEMPERANCE HOUSE BUT RUBBING WHISKY ON THE OUTSIDE ISN'T ANY HARM ARGUED PETER IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU TAKE IT INSIDE IT IS BAD FOR YOU
WHY TWINS ARE JUST PEOPLE THAT SQUINT AREN'T THEY SAID PETER WE THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO BE FUNNY UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN WE LAUGHED UNTIL PETER GOT SULKY I DON'T CARE HE SAID HOW'S A FELLOW TO KNOW
AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID PETER IN A FIERCE WHISPER YOU OUGHTER HAVE MORE SENSE THAN TO SAY SUCH THINGS TO THE GIRLS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ANY WORSE SCARED THAN THEY ARE
AND FLICKERED OVER THE TABLE WHEREON A DELICIOUS MEAL WAS SPREAD FELICITY HAD PUT ON HER BLUE MUSLIN AND LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN IT THAT HER GOOD HUMOUR WAS QUITE RESTORED
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
THE MOON WAS NOW QUITE OBSCURED AND I WAS UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DISCOVERY WHILE I STOOD THERE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF DOCTOR DUNCAN'S STORY AND REFLECTING THAT THE DAUGHTER WAS NOW RETURNING THE KINDNESS SHOWN TO THE MOTHER
PEOPLE WILL TALK TO YOUR PREJUDICE AND MISTER WALTON'S TOO ETHELWYN SMILED SHE WAS NOW AS COLLECTED AS I WAS SEEMING TO HAVE CAST OFF ALL HER WEAKNESS MY HEART WAS UPLIFTED MORE THAN I CAN SAY
AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
I MUST TAKE HER IN HAND I HAD BEEN IN GREAT PERPLEXITY HOW TO LET HER KNOW THAT I WAS THERE FOR TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF TO A LADY BY A VOICE OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF HER BOUDOIR OR TO WAIT FOR CANDLES TO DISCOVER YOU WHERE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS QUITE ALONE
AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
AND SEE THE READ AND FORSAKEN VOLUME LYING ON THE FLOOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT IT AND THE CHAIR BESIDE IT UPON WHICH SHE HAD SAT SO LONG WAITING FOR SOME ONE IN VAIN AND PERHAPS TO WORDS SPOKEN UNDER THESE IMPRESSIONS MAY PARTLY BE ATTRIBUTED THE FACT
BUT I COULD NOT EVEN RECALL THE PAST SUMMER AS BEAUTIFUL I SEEMED TO CARE FOR NOTHING THE FIRST MISERABLE AFTERNOON AT MARSHMALLOWS LOOKED NOW AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE WHOLE OF MY COMING RELATION TO THE PLACE SEEN
I WILL GET YOU SOMETHING AND SHE MOVED TO GO BUT I HELD HER ALL MY TREMBLING WAS GONE IN A MOMENT HER WORDS SO CAREFUL OF ME EVEN IN HER DEEP MISERY WENT TO MY HEART AND GAVE ME STRENGTH THE SUPPRESSED FEELINGS OF MANY MONTHS RUSHED TO MY LIPS
I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
THE MOST REASONABLE IN SUCH MOODS A MAN MIGHT ALMOST BE PERSUADED THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO EXPECT ANY SUCH POETIC ABSURDITY AS THE SUMMER
THEY WILL HARDLY HAVE TIME TO DO SO I TRUST BEFORE IT WILL BE OUT OF THEIR POWER IT RESTS WITH MISS OLDCASTLE HERSELF TO SAY WHEN THAT SHALL BE
SHE LED ME TO A SEAT AT THE FARTHER END AND OPENING A DOOR CLOSE BESIDE ME LEFT ME IN THE DARK THERE I SAT SO LONG THAT I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING BROKEN EVER BY STARTLED EXPECTATION CASTLE AFTER CASTLE I BUILT UP
THE MATE LAY ON A SPARESAIL ON THE QUARTER DECK GROANING I HAD A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE SCHOONER WAS DRIFTING AND HOVE THE LEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT COULD FIND NO BOTTOM
I COULD NOT MISTAKE HIM AT ANY DISTANCE IT WAS OLD ROGERS I FELT BOTH ASHAMED AND COMFORTED WHEN I RECOGNIZED HIM WELL OLD ROGERS I SAID AS SOON AS HE CAME WITHIN HAIL TRYING TO SPEAK CHEERFULLY
AND I DID FEEL VERY READY TO MURMUR LIKE A SPOILT CHILD THAT HAD NOT HAD HIS WAY THINK OF HER THERE AND ME HERE THEN I SAID TO MYSELF AT LAST IT MUST HAVE BEEN SHE THAT PLAYED I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH
I LOOKED UP AND COULD JUST SEE THE WHITENESS OF A FACE BEFORE I COULD SPEAK A VOICE SAID BROKENLY IN A HALF WHISPER WILL YOU SAVE ME MISTER WALTON BUT YOU'RE TREMBLING YOU ARE ILL
BUT WILL SHE COME TO ME I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT VERY WELL I LEAVE MYSELF IN YOUR HANDS I WAS NOW PERFECTLY COLLECTED ALL MY DUBITATION AND DISTRESS WERE GONE FOR I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
JUST AS I WAS LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY LEANED IN ALL DIRECTIONS IRREGULAR
EVEN IF SHE INTENDED THAT I SHOULD HEAR IT COULD ONLY INDICATE AT MOST THAT SHE KNEW
AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE VERY BREATH OF GOD THERE WAS AN ISLAND WITHIN HALF A MILE AND I SAW THE SHINE OF WATER ON THE FACE OF A ROCK ON THE SHORE I CRIED OUT LAND ON THE WEATHER QUARTER
WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
FOR I LOVE YOU AND FOR SOME MOMENTS THERE WERE NO WORDS TO SPEAK I STOOD HOLDING HER HAND CONSCIOUS ONLY OF GOD AND HER AT LAST I SAID THERE IS NO TIME NOW BUT FOR ACTION NOR DO I SEE ANYTHING BUT TO GO WITH ME AT ONCE
WE WERE BECALMED IN THE SOUTH SEAS AND WEARY WORK IT WUR
CAPTAIN EVERARD HAS WHAT GRANDMAMMA CALLS A NEAT LITTLE PROPERTY OF HIS OWN FROM HIS MOTHER
IT WAS NOT THE DAY THAT MADE ME SUCH AS ITSELF THE WEATHER COULD ALWAYS EASILY INFLUENCE THE SURFACE OF MY MIND MY EXTERNAL MOOD BUT IT COULD NEVER GO MUCH FURTHER
AT LAST I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE AND STILL I WAS SURE THE SCHOONER WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING MY HEAD WAS LIKE TO BURST AND MY TONGUE WAS LIKE A LUMP OF HOLYSTONE IN MY MOUTH WELL
HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
MISS OLDCASTLE GO TO YOUR ROOM INSTANTLY I COMMAND YOU SAID HER MOTHER AND SHE APPROACHED AS IF TO REMOVE HER HAND FROM MY ARM I PUT MY OTHER ARM BETWEEN HER AND HER DAUGHTER NO MISSUS OLDCASTLE I SAID
I SAID WITH A SMILE WHICH WAS NONE THE LESS TRUE THAT I SUSPECTED HE HAD READ SOME OF THE WORST TROUBLE OF MY HEART FOR WHY SHOULD I MIND AN HONOURABLE MAN LIKE HIM KNOWING WHAT OPPRESSED ME THOUGH AS THINGS WENT
YOU HAVE MARRIED A BEGGAR AFTER ALL AND THAT YOU'LL BOTH KNOW BEFORE LONG THY MONEY PERISH WITH THEE I SAID AND REPENTED THE MOMENT I HAD SAID IT IT SOUNDED LIKE AN IMPRECATION AND I KNOW I HAD NO CORRESPONDENT FEELING
AND AUNTIE DOESN'T QUITE LIKE IT BUT HE'S VERY NICE HE'S SO FUNNY HE LL BE BACK AGAIN SOON I DARESAY I DON'T QUITE LIKE HIM NOT SO WELL AS YOU BY A WHOLE HALF MISTER WALTON I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY AUNTIE BUT THAT WOULD NEVER DO
THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
IN THE DAYS TO COME NOBODY I SAID BUT OLD ROGERS UNDERSTANDS ME NOBODY WOULD CARE AS FAR AS MY TEACHING GOES IF ANOTHER MAN TOOK MY PLACE FROM NEXT SUNDAY FORWARD AND FOR MISS OLDCASTLE
THERE IS NO LAW HUMAN OR DIVINE TO PREVENT HER FROM MARRYING WHOM SHE WILL HOW OLD ARE YOU ETHELWYN I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO SEEM EVEN COOLER THAN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN ANSWERED MISS OLDCASTLE
I STEPPED BETWEEN HER AND IT PARDON ME MISSUS OLDCASTLE THAT IS THE WAY TO MISS OLDCASTLE'S ROOM I AM HERE TO PROTECT HER WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT CAPTAIN EVERARD HE ADVANCED WITH A LONG STRIDE OF DETERMINATION
I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
MISSUS OLDCASTLE'S DEMEANOUR CHANGED UTTERLY THE FORM OF HER VISAGE WAS ALTERED SHE MADE A SPRING AT HER DAUGHTER AND SEIZED HER BY THE ARM THEN I FORBID IT SHE SCREAMED AND I WILL BE OBEYED I STAND ON MY RIGHTS GO TO YOUR ROOM YOU MINX
HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
BUT ERE HE REACHED ME THE DOOR BEHIND ME OPENED AND MISS OLDCASTLE APPEARED IN HER BONNET AND SHAWL
THAT EVENING IN HER OWN ROOM SUSAN PORED OVER THE TWO INEXPENSIVE MAGAZINES THAT CAME TO THE HOUSE
ABOUT ME YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULDN'T MIND NOW AND OF COURSE IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ABOUT HIS EYES FOR HE DOESN'T NEED FATHER OR OR ANY ONE NOW HER VOICE BROKE
SHE PANTED COMPANY YES YOUR SON KEITH THE MAN DREW BACK PERCEPTIBLY THERE NOW DANIEL BURTON
SUSAN BURST INTO SUCH A STORM OF SOBS THAT SHE HAD TO HURRY TO THE KITCHEN AND SHUT HERSELF IN THE PANTRY LEST THEY BE HEARD LATER
ON HIS LIPS THE TIME WORN QUESTION ASKED BY COUNTLESS OTHER MINDS BACK FROM THAT MYSTERIOUS LAND OF DELIRIUM WHERE AM I SUSAN SPRANG TO HER FEET THEN DROPPED ON HER KNEES AT THE BEDSIDE IN YOUR OWN BED HONEY IS THAT
SO SHORTLY THAT MISSUS MC GUIRE OPENED HER EYES A BIT AND WONDERED WHY SUSAN'S LIPS HAD SNAPPED TIGHT SHUT IN THAT STRAIGHT HARD LINE BUT WHAT AILS THE WOMAN SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF VEXEDLY AS SHE CROSSED THE BACK YARD TO HER OWN DOOR
LOOKING NOT A LITTLE STARTLED AS HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HALF RELUCTANT FEET IN THE STUDIO SUSAN FLOURISHED ACCUSING ARMS LOOK AT THAT
OR ON HIS OWN WITH JOHN MC GUIRE IT IS NO WONDER SURELY THAT VERY SOON THE TOWN CEASED TO STARE AND GOSSIP OR EVEN TO SHAKE WISE HEADS OF PROPHECY NANCY HOLWORTHY'S DEATH WAS TWO MONTHS IN THE PAST
READ THEM HE MUTTERED AS CLEARLY AS HE COULD CONSIDERING THE TIGHTNESS THAT HAD COME INTO HIS THROAT AND SUSAN READ THIS SPRING OH GENTLE SPRING I LOVE THY RILLS I LOVE THY WOODEN ROCKY RILLS
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE TO WALK ANY MORE NOT ANY MORE I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE WHERE ANYBODY'LL SEE ME SHUCKS SUSAN'S VOICE WAS HARSHLY UNSTEADY AGAIN SEE YOU INDEED WHY WE'RE GOIN TO BE SO PROUD OF YOU WE'LL WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE YOU
AND TO HEAR HIM TELL IT IT WAS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL I KNOW I KNOW NODDED SUSAN IT WAS LIKE HIS LETTERS YOU COULD SEE THINGS HE MADE YOU SEE EM AN THAT'S WHAT HE ALWAYS DID
CAN'T I PLEASE AND THIS FROM SUSAN THIS PALPITATING PLEADING PLEASE DANIEL BURTON WITH A HELPLESS GESTURE THAT EXPRESSED EMBARRASSMENT DISMAY BEWILDERMENT AND RESIGNATION THREW UP BOTH HANDS AND SETTLED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
I KNOW SHE HESITATED THEN WENT ON HER COLOR DEEPENING AN I HAIN'T SOLD NONE O THEM POEMS YET BUT THERE'S OTHER MAGAZINES A WHOLE LOT OF EM THAT I HAIN'T TRIED SOMEBODY'S SURE TO TAKE EM SOME TIME
TO STRIKE A MAN WHEN HE IS DOWN AN IN THE DARKNESS TOO FOR IF YOU'LL WATCH THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE TILL COMIN OF THE DAWN YOU'LL FIND WHEN ONCE YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE ARE GONE
HE THEN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN IN PARIS THERE WAS A NOTED SPECIALIST IN WHOM HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE HE WISHED VERY MUCH THAT THIS MAN COULD SEE KEITH TO TAKE KEITH OVER NOW HOWEVER AS WAR CONDITIONS WERE
ONLY A FAINT SHAKE OF THE HEAD ANSWERED HER THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE LOTS BETTER KEITH THERE WAS NO SORT OF REPLY TO THIS AND FOR ANOTHER LONG MINUTE SUSAN SAT TENSE AND MOTIONLESS WATCHING THE BOY'S FACE
AN MAKE YOU SLIP NO CUBES OF PIG LENT GRAY OR BLACK NOR ANY OTHER COLOR LENT BRIGHTNESS TO THIS DANK WORLD AN HE THE ARTIST THE BRIGHT SOUL WHO BOSSED THIS RANCH
CHAPTER ELEVEN NOT PATS BUT SCRATCHES MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT HOME THE NEXT DAY SHE WORE THE AIR OF AN INJURED MARTYR AT BREAKFAST SHE TOLD HER BROTHER THAT OF COURSE
TELLING OF THE FAILURE OF THE SECOND OPERATION SUSAN HAD READ IT AND ACCEPTED IT WITH STERNLY CONTROLLED EYES THAT DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT WHEN KEITH'S LETTER CAME NOT EVEN MENTIONING THE OPERATION HER SELF CONTROL SNAPPED AND SHE BURST OPENLY INTO TEARS
I TRIED TO DO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES INDEED I DID BUT THE WORDS JUST WOULDN'T COME AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN I CAN TELL HIM
AND THERE ARE SO MANY WHO NEED JUST THAT MESSAGE TO STIR THEM FROM THEIR SMUG COMPLACENCY MEN WHO COULD FIGHT AND WIN MEN WHO WOULD FIGHT AND WIN IF ONLY THEY COULD SEE AND HEAR AND KNOW AS I SAW AND HEARD
THEY LIKE THE DARK THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE FOR THEN THEY CAN BE GREAT THEY LOOM LIKE DOOM FROM OUT THE GLOOM AN SHRIEK I AM YOUR FATE BUT AFTER ALL THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE ARE COWARDS SAY NOT YOU
WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW AGAIN NONSENSE KEITH SUSAN WAS BEGINNING TO TALK MORE LIKE HERSELF GO BACK TO BE SICK OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AN BE SICK LISTEN DON'T YOU WORRY AN DON'T YOU FRET SOMETHIN BETTER IS COMIN YET SOMETHIN FINE WHAT'LL YOU BET
BY AND BY THE NURSE CAME IN AND SUSAN LEFT THE ROOM SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE KITCHEN AND SHE DID NOT SO MUCH AS LOOK TOWARD KEITH'S FATHER WHOM SHE MET IN THE HALL IN THE KITCHEN SUSAN CAUGHT UP A CLOTH AND VIGOROUSLY BEGAN TO POLISH A BRASS FAUCET
HIM THAT YOU DON'T MIND BEING WITH BLIND FOLKS A MITE SO NOW HE WON'T CARE A BIT WHEN HE KNOWS YOU ARE DOROTHY PARKMAN BUT THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD AGAIN YES I KNOW HE MIGHT NOT MIND THAT PART PERHAPS
SHE PAUSED DREW A LONG SIGH AND TURNED HER EYES OUT THE WINDOW UP THE WALK WAS COMING DANIEL BURTON HIS STEP WAS SLOW HIS HEAD WAS BOWED HE LOOKED LIKE ANYTHING BUT THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF NEW WEALTH SUSAN FROWNED AS SHE WATCHED HIM
IF HE PREFERRED TO HAVE AN IGNORANT SERVANT GIRL TAKE CARE OF HIS POOR AFFLICTED SON SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY BUT THAT CERTAINLY HE COULD NOT EXPECT HER TO STAY TOO ESPECIALLY AFTER BEING INSULTED AS SHE HAD BEEN
YOU JEST WAIT AN SEE THE FATE THAT I'VE CUT OUT FOR YOU WE'LL BE SO PROUD WE'LL LAUGH ALOUD AN YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN TOO I MADE THAT UP LAST NIGHT WHEN I LAID AWAKE THINKIN OF ALL THE FINE THINGS WE WAS GOIN TO HAVE YOU DO
I KNOW WE WILL AN KEITH
OH KEITH WHY HE'D EVEN FORGET HIS EYES THEN IT WOULD HELP SOME KEITH DREW IN HIS BREATH AND HELD IT A MOMENT SUSPENDED AND HE'D EVEN BE HELPING US TO WIN OUT OVER THERE
T AIN'T FOR ME TO PRETENSE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE INFERRIN TO BUT JEST LET ME TELL YOU THIS
IN ANSWER TO DANIEL BURTON'S AMAZED EXCLAMATION
AND IT WAS THE WAY YOU DID IT WITH NEVER A WORD OR A HINT THAT I WAS DIFFERENT YOU DID THINGS AND YOU MADE ME DO THINGS WITHOUT REMINDING ME ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS BLIND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST DAY WHEN YOU TOLD
WOMEN BROUGHT HIM JELLY AND FRUIT AND MEN CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID HOW ARE YOU MY BOY IN VOICES THAT WERE NOT QUITE STEADY
WOULD IT BOTHER YOU VERY MUCH IF I ATE OUT HERE WITH YOU HE ASKED WITH ME NONSENSE YOU'LL EAT IN THE DININ' ROOM WITH YOUR DAD OF COURSE WHY WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO YOUR EATIN OUT HERE WITH ME
THERE THERE SUSAN INTERPOSED KEITH WITH QUICKLY UPLIFTED HAND WE'LL NOT DISCUSS IT PLEASE YES I KNOW I BEGAN THE SUBJECT MYSELF AND IT WAS MY FAULT
HER STONY GAZE CAREFULLY TURNED AWAY FROM THE WHITE FACE ON THE PILLOW AN TO HAVE TO KEEP RUNNIN UP HERE ALL THE MORNIN WHEN I'VE GOT TO DO THE DISHES AN BAKE BREAD AN MAKE SOAP AN' IF YOU'LL GET MY CLOTHES SUSAN I'LL GET UP
BUT SUSAN JOHN MC GUIRE WOULDN'T TELL IT TO HIM DON'T YOU SEE HE WON'T EVEN SEE ANYBODY BUT ME AND HE DIDN'T TALK LIKE THIS EVEN TO ME UNTIL TO DAY
AN IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL SLAUGHTER HOUSE YOU JEST COME IN HERE SHE BECKONED HIM LEADING THE WAY TO THE STUDIO BUT BUT
HOW IS HE SHE FINISHED UNSTEADILY HE'S WELL VERY WELL HE SEES PEOPLE MAZIE SAYS HE SEES EVERYBODY NOW YES OH YES HE SEES PEOPLE
NONSENSE A GREAT BOY LIKE YOU BEIN TOO TIRED TO GET UP WHY KEITH IT'LL DO YOU GOOD YOU'LL FEEL LOTS BETTER WHEN YOU'RE UP AN DRESSED LIKE FOLKS AGAIN THE BOY GAVE A SUDDEN CRY THAT'S JUST IT SUSAN DON'T YOU SEE I'LL NEVER BE LIKE FOLKS AGAIN
A PROCEEDING SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT SUSAN BROKE OFF HER SONG IN THE MIDDLE OF A HURRAH AND GREW ACTUALLY PALE WHAT IS IT KEITH IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH KEITH SHE FALTERED
AN'T AIN'T WAGES IT'S IT'S SOMETHIN ELSE SOMETHIN VERY IMPORTUNE THERE WAS A SUBDUED EXCITEMENT IN SUSAN'S FACE AND MANNER THAT WAS PUZZLING YET MOST PROMISING
HE SHOWED IT MISS DOROTHY I KNOW A SOFT PINK SUFFUSED THE YOUNG GIRL'S FACE BUT IT WAS MISS STEWART HE WAS GLAD TO SEE NOT DOROTHY PARKMAN AND AFTER THE THINGS HE SAID
I'M GLAD YOUR COURAGE IS STILL GOOD SUSAN BUT I'M AFRAID THE DEAR PUBLIC IS GOING TO APPRECIATE YOUR POEMS ABOUT THE WAY IT DOES MY PICTURES
YET IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THE FORENOON
AND HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF JEREMY TAYLOR BUT HE CONCLUDED SINCE YOU SET ME ABOUT IT MY JUDGMENT HAS CAPSIZED ITSELF
THAT THEY WOULD BUT STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER THE TEACHER OF THEM MIGHT APPROVE AS SHE REPASSED HIM TO GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE DID INDEED SAY A WORD OF KINDNESS BUT IT WAS IN A FORCED TONE
KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
THROUGH WHAT SEEMED AT THE TIME ONLY A SUCCESSION OF INTERRUPTIONS
THAT MADE HIM STRONG IN THE MIDST OF WEAKNESS WHEN THE SON OF MAN IN HIM CRIED OUT LET THIS CUP PASS THE SON OF GOD IN HIM
SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
THEN THE COMFORT YOU GET FROM ME DOES YOU NO HARM AT LEAST IF I WERE TO FIND MY COMPANY MADE YOU THINK WITH LESS HATRED OF YOUR CRIME I SHOULD GO AWAY THAT INSTANT THANK YOU SIR SAID LEOPOLD HUMBLY
PARALLEL WITH THE LINES OF THE CHAIR HER ARMS LYING ON ITS ARMS AND THE FINGERS OF EACH HAND FOLDED DOWN OVER THE END OF EACH ARM SQUARE STRAIGHT RIGHT ANGLED GAZING INTO THE FIRE WITH SOMETHING OF
CONSCIOUS LIFE SPRINGING THEREFROM BUT WAS HE NOT NOW MAKING PEOPLE SUPPOSE HIM MORE CERTAIN OF THE FACT OF THESE THINGS THAN HE WAS
HE GLANCED AT HIS FRIEND SMILED AND SAID IT HAS KILLED ME TOO AND THAT IS A COMFORT THE CURATE ONLY LOOKED HIS REPLY THEY SAY RESUMED LEOPOLD AFTER A WHILE
SHE HAD GONE MUCH FARTHER THAN SHE HAD INTENDED BUT THE MORE DOUBTFUL HELP BECAME THE MORE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY THE AGONY OF A PERISHING HOPE TO SEARCH THE HEART OF WINGFOLD AGAIN THE CURATE PONDERED ARE YOU SURE HE SAID AT LENGTH
AS EARNESTLY AS INTO THE FAR AND VAST WATCHING AT THE VERY PORES OF BEING AND SITTING IN THE GATES OF THE MIGHTY HALLS OF ASSEMBLY BUT ALL IN VAIN
I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
AFTER THE SERMON AS THE SERMON DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE MIST OF HIS EMOTION BEGAN TO DISPERSE INDIVIDUAL FACES OF HIS AUDIENCE AGAIN DAWNED OUT ON THE PREACHER'S KEN
BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO TO EMMELINE IT CANNOT BRING HER UP AGAIN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD OUT OF THE DARK GRAVE EMMELINE IS NOT IN THE DARK GRAVE WHERE IS SHE THEN
NO NOR THE FAITH OF ANY OF THE LAST FEW GENERATIONS
THEN GIVE ME SOME FOOD SOME HOPE I MEAN AND TRY ME AGAIN WITHOUT THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT DUTY OR LIFE OR ANYTHING TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
COMPELLED BY MENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO OCCASION I THEN FORCED MYSELF FOR VERY DREAD OF THE HONESTY OF AN ALL KNOWING GOD TO BREAK THROUGH EVERY CONVENTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE PULPIT
EVERY ONE OF WHICH NATURE FITS FOR A QUEEN BUT ITS NURSES PREVENT FROM GROWING ONE BY PROVIDING FOR IT A CELL TOO NARROW FOR THE UNROLLING OF ROYALTY
AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
FROM THE COUCH SHE TOOK NO NOTICE THAT HE HAD GOT UP AND DRESSED WHILE SHE WAS AT CHURCH AND HE KNEW THAT A CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN THEM AND THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD BORNE AND DONE FOR HIM HE AND HIS SISTER WERE NOW FARTHER APART
THERE WOULD BE MORE HOPE OF HIS FUTURE RETURNED POLWARTH IS THE CHILD HE CONTINUED WHO SITS BY HIS FATHER'S KNEE AND LOOKS UP INTO HIS FATHER'S FACE SERVING THAT FATHER BECAUSE THE HEART OF THE FATHER DELIGHTS TO LOOK DOWN UPON HIS CHILD
BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
WINGFOLD HAD DREADED THAT HIS DISCOVERY OF THE FACT MIGHT REVEAL
AND HIS OBJECT IS TO JUSTIFY HIS OWN THESIS AND DISPROVE HIS NEIGHBOUR'S I WILL ALLOW THAT HE MAY PRIMARILY HAVE ADOPTED HIS THESIS BECAUSE OF SOME SIGN OF TRUTH IN IT BUT HIS MODE OF SUPPORTING IT IS GENERALLY SUCH AS TO BLOCK UP EVERY CRANNY IN HIS SOUL
HOW MUCH A MAN BELIEVES BUT WHATEVER MY ANSWER MIGHT BE HAD I TIME TO CONSIDER IT MY SILENCE MUST AT LEAST NOT BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE AS MY PROFESSION INDICATES THAT AT ALL EVENTS WOULD BE UNTRUE
HER POLDIE ON THE SCAFFOLD GOD IN HEAVEN INFINITELY RATHER WOULD SHE POISON HERSELF AND HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW PLEASED AND CONSOLED HE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR DYING TOGETHER AND THAT REASSURED HER A LITTLE
WHEN HE SAW HER SO CAPABLE OF THE NOBLEST SUBMITTING HER MIND TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE POOREST MEANEST SHABBIEST THEORIES OF LIFE AND TAKING FOR HER GUIDE
AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
BUT THE FIRST PART OF FRIENDSHIP SOMETIMES IS TO CONFESS POVERTY AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT OF THE VERY THINGS CONCERNING WHICH I OUGHT TO KNOW MOST I KNEW LEAST I HAVE BUT LATELY BEGUN TO FEEL AFTER GOD
TRUE BUT OF WHAT SORT ALL IMITATION NEVER AN ORIGINAL AMONGST THEM ALL IF THEY HAD FOUND OUT THE RIGHT WAY WHY CHANGE IT GOOD BUT IT IS RATHER OMINOUS FOR THE CLAIM OF A DIVINE ORIGIN TO YOUR RELIGION
I HAVE BEHELD SUCH GRANDEUR TO ME APPARENTLY ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN INVENTION SUCH A RADIATION OF DIVINE LOVELINESS AND TRUTH SUCH HOPE FOR MAN
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS EVEN IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ WHAT WAS IN MY HEART HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE I WAS EVEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO WISH I KNEW GREEK BECAUSE PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER IF I WERE TO PRAY IN GREEK
RELIGION ITSELF IS THE SAME WAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE ABOUT THE CHURCH BUT DON'T MENTION CHRIST
YET GRACIOUS TO DESCRIBE WHICH I FIND NO WORDS IN THE HALTING TONGUES OF EARTH AND I KNOW SOMETHING OF THEM ALL MOST OF THEM WELL
BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY
THEY MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A RABBIT THAT WAS TOO FAR FROM ITS HOLE HE SAID AND HE WAS NEVER TEMPTED TO TRY IT AGAIN REGULARLY TOO EVERY DAY ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS IT IS A NOBLE WEAKNESS AND FAR ENOUGH FROM COMMON I AM SORRY TO THINK RETURNED POLWARTH THE CURATE THEN TOLD THE GATE KEEPER OF HIS UNCLE'S LEGACY
THOUGH A MEAN PRIDE PERSUADES MEN SO ON THE CONTRARY THE MAN WHO IS HONESTLY ASHAMED HAS BEGUN TO BE CLEAN
I HEARD THE SOUNDS OF THE WORKMEN'S HAMMERS ON THE NEW ONE AS I WENT ALL ELSE WAS SILENCE THE DAY LOOKED SO HONEST AND SO CLEAR OF CONSCIENCE
WHETHER IN THE FRESH HORROR THAT DAY POURED INTO THE CUP THAT HAD SEEMED ALREADY RUNNING OVER IT WAS OF HER BROTHER ONLY SHE THOUGHT OR WHETHER THREATENED SHAME TO HERSELF HAD NOT A PART IN HER MISERY
WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
AND WHERE A MAN HIDES THERE MUST HE REASON BUT WAS IT ANY BUSINESS OF MINE I CREPT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND THERE I DREW DEEP BREATHS OF THE SWEET NIGHT AIR
OH I DON'T MIND SAID PHILIP UNABLE TO CHOKE A LAUGH I CAN REMEMBER THINGS EASILY AND THERE ARE SOME LESSONS I'M VERY FOND OF I'M VERY FOND OF GREEK HISTORY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GREEKS I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN A GREEK
TO SUPPOSE THAT WAKEM HAD THE SAME SORT OF INVETERATE HATRED TOWARD TULLIVER THAT TULLIVER HAD TOWARD HIM WOULD BE LIKE SUPPOSING THAT A PIKE AND A ROACH CAN LOOK AT EACH OTHER FROM A SIMILAR POINT OF VIEW THE ROACH NECESSARILY ABHORS THE MODE IN WHICH THE PIKE GETS HIS LIVING
OBSERVING THAT GYPSIES WERE THIEVES AND HARDLY GOT ANYTHING TO EAT AND HAD NOTHING TO DRIVE BUT A DONKEY TO DAY HOWEVER MAGGIE THOUGHT HER MISERY HAD REACHED A PITCH AT WHICH GYPSYDOM WAS HER REFUGE
WAS ALMOST AS MUCH SET AGAINST WAKEM AS HIS FATHER WAS BUT THIS UNUSUAL CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT NATURALLY GAVE MISSUS TULLIVER AN UNUSUAL POWER OF DEVICE AND DETERMINATION AND A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE SALE TO BE HELD AT THE GOLDEN LION
IT WAS WELL THAT THERE WAS THIS INTEREST OF NARRATIVE TO KEEP UNDER THE VAGUE BUT FIERCE SENSE OF TRIUMPH OVER WAKEM WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CHANNEL HIS JOY WOULD HAVE RUSHED INTO WITH DANGEROUS FORCE EVEN AS IT WAS
IF IT DOES I WILL NOT SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN I KNOW TOM WILL NOT SEE HIM IF HE CAN AVOID IT I DON'T FEEL AT ALL AS TOM DOES ON THAT SUBJECT SAID MAGGIE RISING AND GOING TO THE WINDOW AS IF SHE WANTED TO SEE MORE OF THE LANDSCAPE
WHO WAS IN THE ACT OF TRYING TO RECOVER HIS FEET GRASPED HIM BY THE LEFT ARM SO AS TO PRESS WAKEM'S WHOLE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT ARM WHICH RESTED ON THE GROUND AND FLOGGED HIM FIERCELY ACROSS THE BACK WITH HIS RIDING WHIP WAKEM SHOUTED FOR HELP BUT NO HELP CAME
LUCY GOOD AND SIMPLE AS SHE WAS COULD NOT HELP BLUSHING A LITTLE SHE DID NOT QUITE LIKE THAT STEPHEN SHOULD KNOW THAT MAGGIE NEED NOT HAVE MENTIONED IT PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME PRIDE IN THE CONFESSION THE PRIDE OF POVERTY
AND THE BUSY IDLENESS OF CASTLE BUILDING IN A LAST HALF AT SCHOOL TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF SACKS AND HIDES AND BAWLING MEN THUNDERING DOWN HEAVY WEIGHTS AT HIS ELBOW THE FIRST STEP TOWARD GETTING ON IN THE WORLD WAS A CHILL DUSTY NOISY AFFAIR
BUT THERE WERE GOOD REASONS FOR PURCHASING DORLCOTE MILL QUITE APART FROM ANY BENEVOLENT VENGEANCE ON THE MILLER IT WAS REALLY A CAPITAL INVESTMENT BESIDES GUEST AND CO WERE GOING TO BID FOR IT
LAST NIGHT I WAS TRYING TO FANCY YOU IN A HANDSOME FASHIONABLE DRESS AND DO WHAT I WOULD THAT OLD LIMP MERINO WOULD COME BACK AS THE ONLY RIGHT THING FOR YOU I WONDER IF MARIE ANTOINETTE LOOKED ALL THE GRANDER WHEN HER GOWN WAS DARNED AT THE ELBOWS
THREE WEEKS LATER WHEN DORLCOTE MILL WAS AT ITS PRETTIEST MOMENT IN ALL THE YEAR THE GREAT CHESTNUTS IN BLOSSOM AND THE GRASS ALL DEEP AND DAISIED
I SHOULD HAVE PRAYED FOR HELP SO EARNESTLY I SHOULD HAVE RUSHED AWAY AS WE RUSH FROM HIDEOUS DANGER I FEEL NO EXCUSE FOR MYSELF NONE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FAILED TOWARD LUCY AND PHILIP AS I HAVE DONE IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK SELFISH AND HARD
WHO HAD BEEN OVER THE PREMISES AND HAD LAID BEFORE MISTER DEANE AND MISTER GLEGG IN MISSUS TULLIVER'S PRESENCE HIS WILLINGNESS TO EMPLOY MISTER TULLIVER IN CASE OF HIS RECOVERY AS A MANAGER OF THE BUSINESS THIS PROPOSITION HAD OCCASIONED MUCH FAMILY DEBATING
WAS STEPHEN'S FIRST THOUGHT THE SECOND WHEN SHE HAD BENT OVER HER WORK WAS I WISH SHE WOULD LOOK AT ME AGAIN THE NEXT WAS TO ANSWER I SUPPOSE ALL PHRASES OF MERE COMPLIMENT HAVE THEIR TURN TO BE TRUE
BUT THAT FIRST DOUBTFUL TOTTERING MOMENT PASSED HE SEEMED TO GATHER STRENGTH WITH HIS GATHERING EXCITEMENT AND THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WAS SEATED AT TABLE WITH HIS CREDITORS
HE WAS IN LOVE ALREADY AND HALF ENGAGED TO THE DEAREST LITTLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF IN ANY WAY BUT WHEN ONE IS FIVE AND TWENTY ONE HAS NOT CHALK STONES AT ONE'S FINGER ENDS
SHE TURNED HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND PUSHED ASIDE THE TABLE TO MAKE AN EASY WAY FOR HIM AND THEN STOOD WITH A BEATING HEART TO SEE HIM ENTER AND LOOK ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME TOM ADVANCED BEFORE HIM CARRYING THE LEG REST AND STOOD BESIDE MAGGIE ON THE HEARTH
UNDER A DECREE OF CHANCERY OF MISTER TULLIVER'S FARMING AND OTHER STOCK TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SALE OF THE MILL AND LAND HELD IN THE PROPER AFTER DINNER HOUR AT THE GOLDEN LION
FOR HE COULD SEE IT WITHOUT NOTICING THE HUMP AND IT WAS REALLY NOT A DISAGREEABLE FACE VERY OLD LOOKING TOM THOUGHT HE WONDERED HOW MUCH OLDER PHILIP WAS THAN HIMSELF AN ANATOMIST EVEN A MERE PHYSIOGNOMIST
OR WHETHER WE WILL RENOUNCE THAT FOR THE SAKE OF OBEYING THE DIVINE VOICE WITHIN US FOR THE SAKE OF BEING TRUE TO ALL THE MOTIVES THAT SANCTIFY OUR LIVES I KNOW THIS BELIEF IS HARD
THINK WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO DON'T TREAT ME AS IF YOU COULDN'T TRUST ME HE HAD CHOSEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPEAL BUT MAGGIE'S WILL WAS FIXED UNSWERVINGLY ON THE COMING WRENCH SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO SUFFER WE MUST NOT WAIT
FROM THE KITCHEN AT THE BREAKFAST HOUR THE FAVORITE ANTHEM THE GREEN BOUGHS AND THE SHORT SERMON GAVE THE APPROPRIATE FESTAL CHARACTER TO THE CHURCH GOING AND AUNT AND UNCLE MOSS WITH ALL THEIR SEVEN CHILDREN
STEPHEN THOUGHT AGAIN THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO PREVAIL HE HAD NEVER YET BELIEVED THAT HE SHOULD NOT PREVAIL THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES WHICH OUR MINDS SHRINK FROM TOO COMPLETELY FOR US TO FEAR THEM DEAREST
IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON PASSENGERS AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD TURN INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN BUT NOT ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE LANE AS BEFORE LEST THEY SHOULD STILL BE UNCLE PULLET'S FIELDS
I THINK I GET WORSE AS I GET OLDER MORE SELFISH
ALL LAWYERS WERE MORE OR LESS RASCALS BUT WAKEM'S RASCALITY WAS OF THAT PECULIARLY AGGRAVATED KIND WHICH PLACED ITSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THAT FORM OF RIGHT EMBODIED IN MISTER TULLIVER'S INTERESTS AND OPINIONS
MAGGIE LIKED TO BE CALLED PRETTY LADY AND TREATED IN THIS WAY SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
AS WELL AS IN HIS TABLE TALK FOR WAKEM WAS NOT A MERE MAN OF BUSINESS HE WAS CONSIDERED A PLEASANT FELLOW IN THE UPPER CIRCLES OF SAINT OGG'S CHATTED AMUSINGLY OVER HIS PORT WINE
WHO SAW A VISTA IN THIS DIRECTION IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE DAVID AND GOLIATH AND SAMSON IN THE GREEK HISTORY THOSE ARE THE ONLY BITS I LIKE IN THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OH THERE ARE VERY FINE STORIES OF THAT SORT ABOUT THE GREEKS
POOR MAGGIE SHE WAS SO UNUSED TO SOCIETY THAT SHE COULD TAKE NOTHING AS A MATTER OF COURSE
AND THE PIKE IS LIKELY TO THINK NOTHING FURTHER EVEN OF THE MOST INDIGNANT ROACH THAN THAT HE IS EXCELLENT GOOD EATING IT COULD ONLY BE WHEN THE ROACH CHOKED HIM THAT THE PIKE COULD ENTERTAIN A STRONG PERSONAL ANIMOSITY
AND SAW THAT THE THORNS WERE FOREVER PRESSING ON ITS BROW THE YESTERDAY WHICH COULD NEVER BE REVOKED
AND HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO SAY HOW DO YOU DO ON SO SHORT A NOTICE MISTER STELLING WISELY TURNED AWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM BOYS SHYNESS ONLY WEARS OFF IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR ELDERS
STILL MISTER DEANE WOULD SAY NOTHING DECIDED ABOUT THE MATTER THE FACT THAT WAKEM HELD THE MORTGAGE ON THE LAND MIGHT PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD TO BID FOR THE WHOLE ESTATE AND FURTHER TO OUTBID THE CAUTIOUS FIRM OF GUEST AND CO WHO DID NOT CARRY ON BUSINESS ON SENTIMENTAL GROUNDS
AND WAKEM'S ADVICE HAD NOT CARRIED HIM FAR NO DIX MISTER TULLIVER CONSIDERED HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS NOWHERE IN POINT OF LAW AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS INDIGNATION AGAINST PIVART HIS CONTEMPT FOR A BAFFLED ADVERSARY LIKE DIX
IF YOU LOOK AT IT STRAIGHT FORRARD FOR A RIVER'S A RIVER AND IF YOU'VE GOT A MILL YOU MUST HAVE WATER TO TURN IT
DEAR TINY THING SAID MAGGIE IN ONE OF HER BURSTS OF LOVING ADMIRATION YOU ENJOY OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS SO MUCH I BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO WITHOUT ANY OF YOUR OWN
THE EYES IN THE PARLOR WERE NOT TURNED TOWARD THE BRIDGE JUST THEN AND THE GROUP THERE WAS SITTING IN UNEXPECTANT SILENCE MISTER TULLIVER IN HIS ARM CHAIR TIRED WITH A LONG RIDE AND RUMINATING WITH A WORN LOOK FIXED CHIEFLY ON MAGGIE
HE LONGED TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF A TACIT ASSENT FROM HER BUT EACH TIME HE LOOKED AT HER HE GATHERED A STRONGER DREAD OF THE NEW QUIET SADNESS WITH WHICH SHE MET HIS EYES AND THEY WERE MORE AND MORE SILENT HERE WE ARE IN SIGHT OF MUDPORT HE SAID AT LAST
BUT SOME SUBTLE INFLUENCE PREVENTED HIM FROM FORESEEING THE GOOD FORTUNE AS HAPPENING TO HIMSELF SHAKE HANDS WI ME MY LAD HE SAID SUDDENLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IT'S A GREAT THING WHEN A MAN CAN BE PROUD AS HE'S GOT A GOOD SON I'VE HAD THAT LUCK
IT WAS AS HE HAD DREADED THERE WAS A STRUGGLE COMING BUT NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SAY ANOTHER WORD TILL THE BOAT WAS LET DOWN AND THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE LANDING PLACE HERE THERE WAS A CLUSTER OF GAZERS AND PASSENGERS AWAITING THE DEPARTURE OF THE STEAMBOAT TO SAINT OGG'S
WHEN IT WAS ONCE BROUGHT HOME TO HIS OBSERVATION THAT SHE FOR HER PART HAD NEVER WANTED TO GO TO LAW AND INDEED WAS AT PRESENT DISPOSED TO TAKE MISTER WAKEM'S VIEW OF ALL SUBJECTS RATHER THAN HER HUSBAND'S IN FACT IF THAT ATTORNEY SAW A RESPECTABLE MATRON LIKE HERSELF DISPOSED TO GIVE HIM GOOD WORDS
AH HE WENT ON WITH A LONG DRAWN GUTTURAL ENUNCIATION TAKING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX THE ONLY LUXURY HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF AND TAPPING IT WITH SOMETHING OF HIS OLD AIR OF DEFIANCE I'LL GET FROM UNDER HIS THUMB NOW THOUGH I MUST LEAVE THE OLD MILL
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
WHERE FROM AN OUTJUTTING ROCK AT ITS HEAD YOU WILL GET A FINE VIEW OF ITS REJOICING WATERS AND WILD CANYON AND THE HALF DOME THENCE RETURNING TO THE TRAIL FOLLOW IT TO THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL
AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH MAY BE MET HERE AND THERE THAT HAS ENJOYED SIX OR EIGHT CENTURIES OF STORMS AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
BUT FOR MILES AND MILES IT IS SO SMOOTH AND LEVEL THAT A HUNDRED HORSEMEN MAY RIDE ABREAST OVER IT THE MAIN LOWER PORTION OF THE MEADOWS IS ABOUT FOUR MILES LONG AND FROM A QUARTER TO HALF A MILE WIDE
ALL YOUR BODY AGLOW NERVE CURRENTS FLASHING THROUGH YOU NEVER BEFORE FELT GO TO THE TOP OF THE LIBERTY CAP ONLY A GLAD SAUNTER NOW THAT YOUR LEGS AS WELL AS HEAD AND HEART ARE AWAKE
BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
A BUILDING OF ONE STONE SEWN FROM THE LIVING ROCK WITH SIDES ROOF GABLE SPIRE AND ORNAMENTAL PINNACLES FASHIONED AND FINISHED SYMMETRICALLY LIKE A WORK OF ART AND SET ON A WELL GRADED PLATEAU
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET HIGH AS IF NATURE IN MAKING SO FINE A BUILDING HAD ALSO BEEN CAREFUL THAT IT SHOULD BE FINELY SEEN FROM EVERY DIRECTION ITS PECULIAR FORM AND GRACEFUL MAJESTIC BEAUTY OF EXPRESSION
ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE VALLEY ITS SOUTHERN SLOPES ARE LOW AND EASILY CLIMBED AND ADORNED HERE AND THERE WITH CASTLE LIKE CRUMBLING PILES AND LONG JAGGED CRESTS
FOR NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE SPECIES RANGE UPWARD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET AND ALL PASS ONE ANOTHER MORE OR LESS YET EVEN THOSE SPECIES POSSESSING THE GREATEST VERTICAL RANGE ARE AVAILABLE IN MEASURING THE ELEVATION
WHILE THE RELIEVED BRANCHES SPRING UP AND WAVE WITH STARTLING EFFECT IN THE GENERAL STILLNESS AS IF EACH TREE WAS MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION HUNDREDS OF BROAD CLOUD SHAPED MASSES MAY ALSO BE SEEN
YOU SAUNTER AMONG THE CRYSTALS AND FLOWERS AS IF YOU WERE WALKING AMONG STARS FROM THE SUMMIT NEARLY ALL THE YOSEMITE PARK IS DISPLAYED LIKE A MAP
WHERE IT FIRST SPRINGS OUT INTO THE AIR TO THE HEAD OF THE ROCKY TALUS ON WHICH IT STRIKES AND IS BROKEN UP INTO RAGGED CASCADES IT IS CALLED THE RIBBON FALL OR VIRGIN'S TEARS DURING THE SPRING FLOODS IT IS A MAGNIFICENT OBJECT
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE WORLD TRACING THE RIVER BEYOND THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL WE ARE LEAD INTO THE LITTLE YOSEMITE A VALLEY LIKE THE GREAT YOSEMITE IN FORM SCULPTURE AND VEGETATION
BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
THE FIRST OF THE SIXTY FIVE THAT I DISCOVERED IN THE SIERRA GLACIAL PHENOMENA IN THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN ARE ON THE GRANDEST SCALE AND IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
BUT THERE ARE OTHER HARMONIES THAT BECOME MANIFEST ONLY AFTER OBSERVATION AND STUDY ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FOREST IN LONG CURVING BANDS BRAIDED TOGETHER INTO LACE LIKE PATTERNS IN SOME PLACES
IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
AND NOW AFTER THIS GENERAL VIEW MARK HOW SHARPLY THE RIBS AND BUTTRESSES AND SUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE DEFINED EXCEPTING THE PORTIONS VEILED BY THE BANNERS
SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
THE PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE ARE THEN DECORATED WITH RESPLENDENT BANNERS SOME OF THEM MORE THAN A MILE LONG SHINING STREAMING WAVING WITH SOLEMN EXUBERANT ENTHUSIASM
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
THE SOD IN MOST PLACES IS EXCEEDINGLY FINE AND SILKY AND FREE FROM WEEDS AND BUSHES WHILE CHARMING FLOWERS ABOUND ESPECIALLY GENTIANS DWARF DAISIES POTENTILLAS
AND MANY A MEADOW ALONG THE CANYON STREAM THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER THE MAIN LATERAL MORAINES THAT BOUND THE VIEW BELOW THE CANYON ARE FROM A HUNDRED TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WONDERFULLY REGULAR
FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
WHICH MAY BE CALLED ANNUAL AND CENTURY AVALANCHES WHICH STILL FURTHER ENRICH THE SCENERY THE ONLY PLACE ABOUT THE VALLEY WHERE ONE MAY BE SURE TO SEE THE ANNUAL KIND IS ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF CLOUDS REST
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
ITS LOWER ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET IT IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS LOOSE AIRY WIDE BRANCHING HABIT AND THIN GRAY FOLIAGE FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
THE CEDAR OF LEBANON SAID SIR JOSEPH HOOKER OCCURS UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES
THEIR SLENDER GRAYISH NEEDLES ARE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE INCHES LONG AND INCLINED TO DROOP CONTRASTING WITH THE RIGID DARK COLORED TRUNK AND BRANCHES NO OTHER TREE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE SO SUBSTANTIAL IN ITS BODY
AND ITS DEEPLY SCULPTURED FOUNTAIN PEAKS CALLED
SO HE LOOKED AROUND UNTIL HE FOUND A FLAT BIT OF SHELL THAT JUST SUITED HIM WHEN HE SAT DOWN UPON IT AND GREW FAST LIKE OLD HOLGER DANSKE IN THE DANISH MYTH
THE HEAD BEE NURSE POLITELY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OPENED IT CAUTIOUSLY AND TOLD THE GRUB WHAT THE BEES HAD DECIDED AT FIRST SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EARS
AND ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS WE COULD NOT COLLECT ENOUGH POWDER POST TO DRESS THE CUT SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID HOWEVER
AT LEAST TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SHIPS WHICH HAD NOW CROSSED OUR WAKE HE ADDED BLAST THOSE NANTUCKETERS THEY CAN SMELL A SPERM WHALE FIVE MILES TO THEIR LEEWARD ANY TIME HE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE RIGGING AND ORDERED THE HEAD SAILS THROWN BACK
WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
AND THEY PERSPIRED AS WELL AS THEY HAD LEARNED TO AND THE PRETTIEST YELLOW WAX CAME OUT OF THEIR BODIES GOOD SAID THE QUEEN NOW WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD THE OLD BEES TOOK THE WAX AND BEGAN TO BUILD A NUMBER OF LITTLE SIX SIDED CELLS ALL ALIKE AND CLOSE UP TO ONE ANOTHER
BUT NOTHING THAT WE COULD DO SUFFICED TO WARM US AND WE LAY SHIVERING FOR WHAT SEEMED HOURS JOHN AND I FINALLY FELL ASLEEP AND PERHAPS WILLIS DID ALSO ALTHOUGH HE ALWAYS DENIED IT AT LAST HE WAKED US SHAKING US VIOLENTLY YOU MUSTN'T SLEEP HE EXCLAIMED
RAY HAD HALF PROMISED TO VISIT HIS NEW BRUNSWICK ACQUAINTANCE DURING THE DEER HUNTING SEASON AND LATE IN AUGUST WAS REMINDED OF THE FACT A SECOND LETTER CAME IN SEPTEMBER THE CAREFULLY WORDED SCHOOL ENGLISH OF THE WRITER
THEY HAVE NO EYES AND WHERE ARE THEIR LEGS AND WINGS
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE WATER LEFT IN THE BOAT WHICH EMPTY OF MEN NOW FLOATED HIGH
INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
WILLIS AND I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HURRY THEN SAID WILLIS OR WE SHALL BE LATE TO THANKSGIVING DINNER I'M HUNGRY NOW WE RAN TO THE BARN THE LEAN TO DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES BUT WOODEN PINS HELD THE OAK BRACES OF THE FRAME IN POSITION WE KNOCKED OUT THE PINS
AND A FLAT IRON DENTED THE FLOOR CLOSE BESIDE IT THEN THE ANIMAL CIRCLED THE ROOM DODGED ANOTHER MISSILE AND HID IN A DARK CORNER RAY COULD HEAR JACQUES TOSSING THINGS ABOUT IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE MILK ROOM
THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
ONLY UNLIKE HOLGER HE DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP BUT PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIMSELF AT HOME SO HE MADE AN OPENING IN HIS UPPER SIDE AND RIGGED FOR HIMSELF A MOUTH AND A STOMACH AND PUT A WHOLE ROW OF FEELERS OUT
HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
AND IT WAS YANKED UNDER THE BOW THWART AND JAMMED THERE THE BOAT NOW SHOT AHEAD WITH FURIOUS SPEED IT WAS GROWING DARKER AND I COULD SCARCELY MAKE OUT THE SHIP IN VAIN I LOOKED FOR THE BOAT WOULD IT NEVER COME TO ADD TO MY TROUBLE
AND CALLING TO THE SHIP'S COOPER HE SAID BANGS YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SHIP DURING MY ABSENCE FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR BOATS IS FASTENED TO A WHALE
HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
AND GREAT FERNS AND RUSHES BIG AS AN OAK AND TALL AS A STEEPLE GREW OVER THE LAND HUGE REPTILES WITH JAWS LIKE A FRONT DOOR AND TEETH LIKE CROSS CUT SAWS AND LITTLE REPTILES WITH WINGS LIKE BATS
THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS I VENTURED TO CRAWL FORWARD ON THE THWARTS AND FOUND THE WHALE LINE WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE BOW I WENT BACK TO THE STERN AND SAT ON THE AFTER THWART THINKING OF THE GUN
FROM THE FRAMES OF OLD BUILDINGS WHEN OF OAK POWDER POST WILL SOMETIMES RUN IN STREAMS WHEN A BEAM OR BRACE IS STRUCK BUT EVERYTHING HAS ITS VIRTUES IF ONLY THEY CAN BE FOUND OUT AND LONG AGO IN NEW ENGLAND
ALL THE TIME THEY WERE BUILDING THE OTHERS CAME FLYING IN WITH FLOWER DUST AND HONEY WHICH THEY LAID AT THE QUEEN'S FEET WE CAN NOW KNEAD THE DOUGH SHE SAID BUT FIRST PUT A LITTLE HONEY IN THAT MAKES IT TASTE SO MUCH BETTER THEY KNEADED AND KNEADED
HE HAD AT HIS SIDES AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF LITTLE PADDLES THAT WENT FLAPPING FLAPPING ALL THE TIME KEEPING HIM CONSTANTLY IN MOTION WHETHER THE LITTLE FELLOW WANTED TO GO OR NOT SO HE KEPT SCUDDING ALONG IN THE WATER DODGING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
WE HAD RUN FIVE MILES THROUGH THE WOODS ONLY TO REACH THE PLACE FROM WHICH WE HAD STARTED JOHN LOOKED AT ME AND I LOOKED AT WILLIS A SENSE OF UTTER BEWILDERMENT FELL ON US JOHN AND I DID NOT EVEN THINK TO REVILE WILLIS IN FACT WE WERE TERRIFIED
AND DRIVE THE LYNX OUT HE MADE A RUSH BUT THE ANGRY CREATURE TURNED AND DASHED AT HIS LEGS SO VICIOUSLY THAT IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS HE TOO FOUND HIMSELF PERCHED PRECARIOUSLY ON THE CANOPY OF HIS OWN BED
AS HE LEFT ME HE SANG OUT DON'T LET THOSE NANTUCKETERS STEAL THE WHALE FROM YOU BOY
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
AND HOGS WITH NOSES SO LONG THEY COULD SIT ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND ROOT AND LOTS OF STILL STRANGER CREATURES THAT NO MAN EVER SAW ALIVE
HE'S GOT AN AWFUL THICK HEAD OF HAIR SAID JOHN BUT HE FELT WARM SEEMED TO BE ALL HAIR I'LL BET IT'S A BEAR CRIED WILLIS DENNED UP UNDER THE FLOOR WITH THAT JOHN AND I MADE FOR THE DOOR BUT WILLIS SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD COME OUT IF IT WAS ASLEEP FOR THE WINTER
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER TO US SAID THE BEES BUT ALL THE SAME THEY FLEW OUT FOR THEY HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE WINTER IN THE HIVE
A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
AT THIS EXHIBITION OF HIS GUEST'S ECCENTRICITY BUT HIS HOSPITALITY WAS MORE THAN EQUAL TO THE STRAIN NON NON HE REPLIED
LET THEM GO ON FIGHTING THEN WE SHALL SEE WHICH OF THEM IS THE STRONGEST AND WE WILL CHOOSE HER TO BE OUR QUEEN WE CAN'T DO WITH MORE THAN ONE
BUT PLAINLY FINDING NO GUNS AND AS PLAINLY GETTING COLDER EVERY MINUTE SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AT ONCE HE CLUTCHED A FLAT IRON IN EACH HAND SCREWED HIS COURAGE TO THE STICKING POINT AND DROPPED TO THE FLOOR
AND TWISTED IT TIGHT WITH A STICK BUT BLOOD FLOWED PROFUSELY WE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO APPLY A TOURNIQUET
AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
AND HAD LIVED THERE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS ILL FORTUNE BESET HIM HOWEVER
BUT SHE WAS QUITE AFRAID OF THE WICKED QUEEN AND DARED NOT STIR I HOPE SHE WON'T KILL THE PRINCESSES SHE THOUGHT AND SQUEEZED HERSELF NEARER TO THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED THE QUEEN LOOKED CAUTIOUSLY ROUND ON ALL SIDES AND THEN OPENED THE FIRST OF THE DOORS
IN FACT THERE WERE WHALES EVERYWHERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BOAT AND DOWN BENEATH IT I COULD DIMLY SEE THEIR GREENISH WHITE REFLECTIONS AS THEY SWAM JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE ONE OLD COW WHALE AND HER CALF WERE CLOSE BESIDE ME AND AS THEY CAME UP TO SPOUT I COULD FEEL THE WATER
THAT MADE A NOISE WELL NIGH AS LOUD AS A GUN WHEN WE GAVE JUST THE RIGHT SORT OF BLOW THE TROUT BELOW WOULD TURN ON THEIR BACKS AND FLOAT UP TO THE ICE JOHN AND I SOON SECURED TWO GOOD STRINGS OF TROUT AND BY THIS TIME WILLIS
IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
WHAT MADE HIM THINK OF SUCH A THING HE SAYS THEY'RE DIRTY BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST COME OUT OF EGG SHELLS AND HE INSISTS THAT THE YELLOW ON THEM IS YOLK OF EGG I TOLD HIM IT WASN'T BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME AND JOHNNIE WRUNG HER HANDS
WAS PLACED SAFELY ON A LITTLE TABLE BESIDE THE BED AND KATY SAT WATCHING COUSIN HELEN EAT HER SUPPER WITH A WARM LOVING FEELING AT HER HEART I THINK WE ARE SCARCELY EVER SO GRATEFUL TO PEOPLE
ONLY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO HIT THE STRIKER WHEN YOU START THE PENDULUM HAVE YOU REALLY SAID KATY WHY DORRY YOU'RE A GENIUS I'M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED
I'LL STUDY AND KEEP MY THINGS IN ORDER AND BE EVER SO KIND TO THE LITTLE ONES DEAR ME IF ONLY AUNT IZZIE WAS COUSIN HELEN HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
BUT NOTHING TASTES FIRST RATE WHEN FRIENDS ARE AWAY KATY AND CLOVER STARED AS WELL THEY MIGHT SUCH LANGUAGE FROM A BRIGAND JOHN BILLINGS HAS BOUGHT A NEW HORSE
COUSIN HELEN LAUGHED HEARTILY
AND OF USE NEVER SAW AS SHE DRIFTED ON HER HEEDLESS WAY THAT HERE IN THIS LONELY LITTLE SISTER WAS THE VERY CHANCE SHE WANTED FOR BEING A COMFORT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED COMFORT VERY MUCH SHE NEVER SAW IT
HAD ROST BEFE FOR DINER AND CABAGE AND POTATO AND APPEL SAWSE AND RICE PUDING I DO NOT LIKE RICE PUDING WHEN IT IS LIKE OURS
DO YOU SUPPOSE IF KATY WOULD EXCUSE ME FROM THE REST OF MY PRACTISING I COULD GET IT DONE I'VE A GREAT MIND TO GO AND ASK HER THERE'S HER BELL SAID CLOVER AS A LITTLE TINKLE SOUNDED UP STAIRS I'LL ASK HER IF YOU LIKE NO LET ME GO
WHY OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT RIPE SAID CLOVER PUTTING ONE INTO HER MOUTH CAN'T YOU TELL BY THE TASTE THEY'RE AS GREEN AS CAN BE I DON'T CARE IF KATY SAYS THEY'RE RIPE I SHALL EAT EM
BUT EXCEPT FOR THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED THAT SHE WAS SICK SHE DIDN'T FOLD HER HANDS AND SHE DIDN'T LOOK PATIENT BUT ABSOLUTELY GLAD AND MERRY HER DRESS WASN'T A FRILLED WRAPPER BUT A SORT OF LOOSE TRAVELLING THING OF PRETTY GRAY STUFF
AND DEAR OLD MARY WITH HER APRON AT HER EYES CRYING FOR JOY OH THE FRONT DOOR IS OPEN SAID KATY IN A DELIGHTED TONE HOW NICE AND WHAT A PRETTY OIL CLOTH THAT'S NEW SINCE I WAS HERE
BUT PAPA SAID WAIT IT WILL TIRE YOU MUCH MORE THAN WALKING ABOUT ON A LEVEL HE EXPLAINED YOU HAD BETTER PUT IT OFF A LITTLE WHILE TILL YOU ARE QUITE SURE OF YOUR FEET I THINK SO TOO SAID CLOVER AND BESIDE
HAD INVITED HERSELF TO TEA OR AS IF SOME CHARACTER OUT OF A BOOK ROBINSON CRUSOE SAY OR AMY HERBERT HAD DRIVEN UP WITH A TRUNK
ALMOST WE START FORGETFUL FOR A MOMENT ALMOST WE ANSWER
LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
HER FACE WAS EXTREMELY RED IN THE COLDEST WEATHER SHE APPEARED HOT
AND YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF THINGS WERE A LITTLE CROOKED JUST AT FIRST WOULD YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHOULD BE LEARNING ALL THE TIME DO LET ME TRY IT WILL BE REAL NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS I SIT UP HERE ALONE SO MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING A STRANGER IN THE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE CHILDREN OR ANYTHING
JUST AS THEY WERE READY THE SIDE DOOR BANGED AND KATY AND CECY HALL CAME INTO THE YARD I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT CECY SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE CHILDREN'S AND LIVED IN A HOUSE NEXT DOOR
HE SAID THAT WAS ALL BUT SOMETHING IN THE TONE MADE KATY CURIOUS
NO SAID KATY FEELING HER CHAIR SHAKE AND KEEPING HER OWN COUNTENANCE WITH DIFFICULTY SHE WAS HERE FOR THREE DAYS LAST WEEK TO MAKE JOHNNIE A SCHOOL DRESS
HERE ENDED THE EXTRACTS AND IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY A MINUTE HAD PASSED SINCE THEY STOPPED LAUGHING OVER THEM BEFORE THE LONG SHADOWS BEGAN TO FALL AND MARY CAME TO SAY THAT ALL OF THEM MUST COME IN TO GET READY FOR TEA
PROVED TO BE TYPHOID FEVER THE DOCTORS SAID THAT THE HOUSE MUST BE KEPT QUIET SO JOHN AND DORRY AND PHIL WERE SENT OVER TO MISSUS HALL'S TO STAY ELSIE AND CLOVER WERE TO HAVE GONE TOO BUT THEY BEGGED SO HARD AND MADE SO MANY PROMISES OF GOOD BEHAVIOR
IT WAS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE EMPTY BASKETS AND GO HOME FEELING THAT THE LONG DELIGHTFUL SATURDAY WAS OVER AND THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANOTHER FOR A WEEK BUT IT WAS COMFORTING TO REMEMBER THAT PARADISE WAS ALWAYS THERE AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT
RIGHT AWAY RATHER THAN HAVE MY COAT TAILS PULLED OFF ANSWERED DOCTOR CARR LAUGHING AND THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER KATY SAT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN A PEACEFUL HAPPY MOOD OH SHE THOUGHT CAN IT REALLY BE
IT WAS A CONFUSED MELANCHOLY TIME THE THREE GIRLS DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SICKNESS BUT PAPA'S GRAVE FACE AND THE HUSHED HOUSE WEIGHED UPON THEIR SPIRITS AND THEY MISSED THE CHILDREN VERY MUCH OH DEAR SIGHED ELSIE
WENT ON CLOVER SOMETHING LIKE LUCY IN MISSUS SHERWOOD I GUESS WITH BLUE EYES AND CURLS AND A LONG STRAIGHT NOSE AND SHE'LL KEEP HER HANDS CLASPED SO ALL THE TIME AND WEAR
YOU KNOW HE LIKES THEM TO BE LEFT JUST SO WILL YOU PLEASE GO AND REMIND HER THAT SHE IS NOT TO TOUCH THEM AT ALL AFTER THE CARPET IS PUT DOWN I WANT YOU TO DUST THE TABLE SO AS TO BE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS PUT BACK IN THE SAME PLACE WILL YOU
AND AS NOBODY SEEMED TO HEAR WHEN I RANG THE BELL I VENTURED TO COME RIGHT UP STAIRS I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING PRIVATE NOT AT ALL SAID KATY POLITELY ELSIE DEAR MOVE UP THAT LOW CHAIR PLEASE
BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT AWAY FROM HOME
WHEN SHE TRIPPED UPON HER BOOT LACE WHICH AS USUAL WAS DANGLING MADE A MISSTEP AND STUMBLED SHE CAUGHT AT THE DOOR TO SAVE HERSELF THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND KATY WITH THE TRAY CREAM RASPBERRIES ROSE AND ALL
I HAVE TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD BETTER LIE STILL AND NOT TRY TO GET UP THIS EVENING OLD MARY WILL COME IN TO UNDRESS YOU KATY YOU WON'T MIND WILL YOU DEAR N O SAID KATY RELUCTANTLY BUT SHE DID MIND AUNT IZZIE HAD GROWN USED TO HER AND HER WAYS
IN PAPA IN THE CHILDREN IN YOURSELF YOU HAVE WON THE PLACE WHICH YOU RECOLLECT I ONCE TOLD YOU AN INVALID SHOULD TRY TO GAIN OF BEING TO EVERYBODY THE HEART OF THE HOUSE OH COUSIN HELEN DON'T
A LITTLE FAT MAN WITH A WAND IN HIS HAND POPPED OUT FROM BEHIND THE STUMP IT WAS SANTA CLAUS OF COURSE HE GAVE THE BULL SUCH A RAP WITH HIS WAND THAT HE MOO ED DREADFULLY AND THEN PUT UP HIS FORE PAW TO SEE IF HIS NOSE WAS ON OR NOT
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY DINNER TODAY ONLY JUST BREAD AND BUTTER AND MILK AND COLD HAM UP IN KATY'S ROOM BECAUSE DEBBY IS HELPING TOO SO AS TO GET THROUGH AND SAVE PAPA ALL THE FUSS AND SEE EXHIBITING HER SEWING KATY'S MAKING A NEW COVER FOR PAPA'S PINCUSHION
OH MY SHE CRIED SEE WHAT SOMEBODY'S DROPPED I'M GOING TO HAVE IT SHE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP BUT JUST AS HER FINGERS TOUCHED THE STEMS THE NOSEGAY AS IF BEWITCHED BEGAN TO MOVE
HE SAID HE WASN'T HUNGRY AND MISSUS JACKSON'S BOY CAME FOR HIM BEFORE WE WERE THROUGH OH DEAR SIGHED KATY I DO HOPE HE ISN'T GOING TO BE SICK HOW IT RAINS CLOVY I WISH YOU'D RUN DOWN AND GET OUT HIS SLIPPERS AND PUT THEM BY THE FIRE TO WARM
ALL THE TIME SHE STAYS WON'T IT BE FUNNY GIGGLED CLOVER HER SOBER LITTLE FACE GROWING BRIGHT AT THE IDEA OF THIS VARIATION ON THE HYMNS THE TIME SEEMED VERY LONG TILL THE NEXT AFTERNOON
AND SHE WAS NOW OVER FOURTEEN CLOVER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE TALL HER EYES WERE AS BLUE AND SWEET AS EVER
PERHAPS SAID DORRY
COUSIN HELEN'S PERFECTLY LOVELY SHE TOLD CLOVER AND SHE'S GOT ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NIGHT GOWN ALL LACE AND RUFFLES IT'S JUST LIKE A NIGHT GOWN IN A BOOK ISN'T IT WICKED TO CARE ABOUT CLOTHES WHEN YOU'RE SICK
THEN SEEING THE MORTIFICATION ON DORRY'S FACE SHE MADE UP HER MIND YES TAKE IT DORRY I'M SURE YOU'LL BE CAREFUL
DO BE CAREFUL KATY I REALLY THINK BRIDGET HAD BETTER TAKE IT OH NO NO PROTESTED KATY I'M MOST UP ALREADY AND SHE SPED UP STAIRS AS FAST AS SHE COULD GO LUCKLESS SPEED
I'LL SEE WHAT SHE WANTS BUT CLOVER WAS ALREADY HALF WAY ACROSS THE HALL AND THE TWO GIRLS RAN UP SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS OFTEN A LITTLE STRIFE BETWEEN THEM AS TO WHICH SHOULD ANSWER KATY'S BELL BOTH LIKED TO WAIT ON HER SO MUCH KATY CAME TO MEET THEM AS THEY ENTERED
LEFT BEHIND WOULD CRY BITTER TEARS AND AS SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO PLAY MUCH WITH DORRY AND JOHN HER PRINCIPAL COMFORT WAS TRACKING THE OLDER ONES ABOUT AND DISCOVERING THEIR MYSTERIES ESPECIALLY THE POST OFFICES
DO SIT DOWN IMOGEN I'M SORRY NOBODY ANSWERED YOUR RING BUT THE SERVANTS ARE CLEANING HOUSE TO DAY AND I SUPPOSE THEY DIDN'T HEAR SO IMOGEN SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO RATTLE ON IN HER USUAL MANNER
SAID CAROLINE REPENTANTLY I WISH MAMMA HAD TRAINED ME TO IT WHEN I WAS A CHILD AS THE DUCHESS OF KENT TRAINED THE PRINCESS I MIGHT HAVE LEARNED TO LIKE IT BY THIS TIME LONG BEFORE THIS SAID CONSTANCE DO YOU REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD SAYING
MORE THAN WANT OF FUNDS THE SECOND BELL WAS BEGINNING TO CHIME AS THE CHANNINGS ENTERED THE CLOISTER GATES TOM AND CHARLES HAD GONE ON BEFORE PANTING BREATHLESS ALMOST KNOCKING DOWN ANNABEL
HOW MANY PEOPLE CALLED IN WHILE CHANNING WAS AT COLLEGE AND YOU WERE KEEPING OFFICE DEMANDED MISTER GALLOWAY ROLAND FIDGETED FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER HE FELT THAT IT MUST ALL COME OUT WHAT A PASSION HE'LL GO INTO WITH ME THOUGHT ROLAND

NOT IN THE MASTER INTERRUPTED GAUNT A SNEAK A COWARD IF HE HAS A SPARK OF MANLY HONOUR IN HIM HE'LL SPEAK UP NOW AS IT HAS COME TO THIS I SAY CHARLEY CHANNING SHOULD BE MADE TO DECLARE WHAT HE KNOWS SAID ONE HE SAW IT DONE WHO SAYS HE DID
WHAT IF I DO FORBID IT SHE WALKED A LITTLE FORWARD LEAVING THE CARNATION BED AND HALTED UNDER THE SHADE OF THE DARK CEDAR TREE HER HEART AND COLOUR ALIKE FADING MISTER YORKE FOLLOWED AND STOOD BEFORE HER WILLIAM I MUST DO MY DUTY
WOULD YOU UNDERTAKE TO GET UP AND BE READY FOR ME ASKED CONSTANCE CAROLINE DREW A LONG FACE SHE DID NOT SPEAK MY DEAR YOU ARE FIFTEEN WELL RESPONDED CAROLINE
TARTLY RETURNED MISTER GALLOWAY I HAVE MY REASONS FOR THE ASSERTION DID YOU SEE ME PUT THE BANK NOTE INTO THE LETTER OF COURSE I DID SIR I WAS STANDING BY WHEN YOU DID IT I REMAINED BY YOU AFTER BRINGING YOU THE NOTE FROM THIS ROOM
I STAMPED IT WITH MY PRIVATE SEAL MISTER ROBERT GALLOWAY RECEIVED THIS ON THE MONDAY MORNING HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE POST BUT FORWARDED THE REPLY BY TELEGRAPH
ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM IN A DIRTY MORNING WRAPPER AND RANG THE BELL IS NOBODY DOWN CRIED SHE SHARPLY I THINK NOT MY LADY
ORACULARLY SPOKE TOM WILL YOU CONDESCEND TO INFORM ME HOW YOU KNOW IT TOM IF YOU WILL NOT INFORM ANNABEL ASKED MISTER CHANNING TOM LAUGHED THE DEAN BEGAN HIS CLOSE RESIDENCE YESTERDAY PAPA
SHE HAD SLIPPED AN OLD BUFF DRESSING GOWN OVER HER CLOTHES IN HER CAPACITY OF NURSE
HE HAD CAST A DOUBT UPON WHETHER ARTHUR CHANNING HAD POSTED THE LETTERS HIMSELF ARTHUR ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD DONE SO AND MISTER GALLOWAY BELIEVED HIM
BUT NOT THE NOTE YOU MUST HAVE OMITTED TO ENCLOSE IT WAS THE NEWS IT CONTAINED RELATIVE TO THAT PARTICULAR POINT MISTER GALLOWAY KNEW THAT HE HAD ENCLOSED THE NOTE THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT BOTH HIS CLERKS COULD TESTIFY THAT HE HAD DONE SO
ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
FOR I AM DETERMINED TO COME TO THE BOTTOM OF IT I CAN GET NOTHING SATISFACTORY FROM HIM SO I MUST TRY WHAT I CAN DO WITH YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME HOW YOU SPENT YOUR TIME ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY
NOT AT ALL ANSWERED LADY AUGUSTA I NEVER CHAPERON TWO CHILDREN TO A CROWDED MEETING PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY TOOK UP THE ROOM OF GROWN UP PERSONS YOU WILL LET ME GO NOT CAROLINE MISS CHANNING PLEADED FANNY WHEN HER MOTHER

BEFORE I BEGIN WILL YOU TELL ME WHETHER YOU CONDESCEND TO ADMIT THAT OUR GOOD QUEEN IS A REAL LADY OH MISS CHANNING NOW YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME AS IF ANY ONE IN ALL ENGLAND COULD BE SO GREAT A LADY AS THE QUEEN VERY GOOD
AND VOWING THE MOST INTENSE VENGEANCE UPON THE COLLEGE BOYS THE OCCURRENCE NATURALLY CAUSED HIM TO CAST BACK HIS THOUGHTS TO THAT OTHER TRICK THE LOCKING HIM INTO THE CLOISTERS IN WHICH JENKINS HAD BEEN A FELLOW VICTIM AND HE DOUBLED HIS FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER
LAST FRIDAY AFTERNOON DURING CHANNING'S HOUR FOR COLLEGE WHAT NOT AT ALL EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO HAD NOT SUSPECTED THAT YORKE WAS ABSENT SO LONG AS I SAY IT'S MY LUCK TO BE FOUND OUT
CHECKMATED CONSTANCE CHANNING PROCEEDED TO HER DUTIES AS USUAL AT LADY AUGUSTA YORKE'S SHE DREW HER VEIL OVER HER FACE ONLY TO TRAVERSE THE VERY SHORT WAY THAT CONVEYED HER THITHER FOR THE SENSE OF SHAME WAS STRONG UPON HER
THAT IS JUST WHAT MISSUS JENKINS SAID THIS MORNING RETURNED ARTHUR
GONE OUT FOR WHAT TRIPE ASKED THE GIRL WHAT BE YOU TALKING OF THE TRIPE FOR SUPPER SAID KETCH THERE AIN'T NO TRIPE FOR SUPPER REPLIED SHE THERE IS TRIPE FOR SUPPER PERSISTED KETCH
IF YOU CAN GIVE ME NO BETTER ASSURANCE OF YOUR INNOCENCE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME NO EXPLANATION OF THE PECULIAR AND MOST UNSATISFACTORY MANNER IN WHICH YOU HAVE MET THE CHARGE YES TO RETAIN YOU HERE WOULD BE UNJUST TO MY OWN INTERESTS
TO GIVE THE SERVANTS THEIR DUE BREAKFAST ON THIS MORNING WAS ON THE TABLE AT NINE
THE GIRL POSSIBLY FEELING A LITTLE CURIOSITY HERSELF CAME UP WITH HER CANDLE MASTER AIN'T SO WELL TO NIGHT REMARKED SHE HE'S GONE TO BED AND MISSIS IS PUTTING HIM A PLASTER ON HIS CHEST THE WORDS FELL AS ICE ON OLD KETCH A MUSTARD PLASTER
THE MEN HAVE FORKED IT AS THEY DID LADY AUGUSTA'S PILLS HE SAYS IT WAS NOT THE POST OFFICE MUSED ARTHUR HE SAID AS I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH PROVED TO HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT HERE
THE FACT IS YOU ARE TWO BIRDS OF A FEATHER STORMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO WHEN ONCE ROUSED WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN WOULD SAY ANYTHING THAT CAME UPPERMOST JUST OR UNJUST THE ONE WON'T TELL TALES OF THE OTHER IF
SHE HAD STILL MUCH TO DO ERE SHE COULD BE PRESENTABLE FOR COLLEGE CAROLINE FOLLOWED FANNY WONDERED WHAT GERALD AND TOD WOULD DO NOT YET DOWN THOSE BOYS WILL GET A TANNING TO MORROW FROM OLD PYE
THAT POSITIVE PROOF OF HIS INNOCENCE WILL BE DIFFICULT WELL IT IS A DREADFUL THING CONCLUDED LADY AUGUSTA MEANWHILE AT THE VERY MOMENT HER LADYSHIP WAS SPEAKING THE MAGISTRATES WERE IN THE TOWN HALL IN FULL CONCLAVE THE CASE BEFORE THEM THE NEWS HAD SPREAD
STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE SUCH A HATRED TO AS TRIPE AND HE KNOWS IT IS THIS THE WAY TO TREAT A MAN FOAMED KETCH DISAPPOINTMENT AND HUNGER DRIVING HIM ALMOST INTO THE STATE HINTED AT BY MISSUS JENKINS
NOT SHAME FOR ARTHUR BUT FOR HAMISH IT HAD HALF BROKEN CONSTANCE'S HEART THERE ARE TIMES IN OUR EVERY DAY LIVES WHEN ALL THINGS SEEM TO WEAR A DEPRESSING ASPECT TURN WHICH WAY WE WILL THEY WERE WEARING IT THAT DAY TO CONSTANCE
HER COFFEE IS ALWAYS COLD
PAPA COULD NOT SPARE ME TO GO OUT ALTOGETHER ANNABEL COULD NOT SPARE ME EITHER AND I WOULD NOT SPARE YOU HE STRUCK IN FILLING UP HER PAUSE WAS THAT WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY CONSTANCE
IT'S THE HOLIDAY THEY ARE ASKING FOR OH
AS THOUGH ASTONISHED TO SEE ME IN SUCH A PLACE FOR I WAS ELEGANTLY ATTIRED LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE APPROACHED MY TABLE AND SEEING THAT ALL THE BOTTLES WERE EMPTY SMILED
I REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE WHAT BRIGITTE HAD SAID AND I PLACED NEAR HER ALL THAT I SUPPOSED SHE WOULD NEED FOR THE NIGHT I LOOKED AT HER AND THEN WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PRESSED MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE PANE PEERING OUT AT A SOMBER AND LOWERING SKY THEN I RETURNED TO THE BEDSIDE
AND WE FOUND PLEASURE IN THAT VERY UNCERTAINTY WHILE GLANCING OVER THE MAP WE SAID WHERE SHALL WE GO WHAT SHALL WE DO WHERE SHALL WE BEGIN LIFE ANEW
ALBUMS PICTURES BOOKS AND THE DEAR MAP WE LOVED SO MUCH
MERELY SAY WE WILL NOT LIVE IS NOT LIFE A BURDEN THAT WE LONG TO LAY DOWN WHY HESITATE WHEN IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF A LITTLE SOONER OR A LITTLE LATER MATTER IS INDESTRUCTIBLE
HOW CAN THE WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN PRAISED RESOLVE TO BE PRAISED NO MORE DOES SHE THINK SHE IS LIVING WHEN SHE REMAINS IN THE SHADOW AND THERE IS SILENCE ROUND ABOUT HER BEAUTY HER BEAUTY ITSELF IS THE ADMIRING GLANCE OF HER LOVER
I SUDDENLY CRIED OUT WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM WHO TOLD YOU TO DRY MY TEARS IS THIS YOUR VOCATION AND DO YOU THINK I DESIRE YOU
HOLDING OUT HIS FEEBLE WRINKLED HANDS HE WOULD BLESS ME AS HE SMILED UPON ME I FELT THE MORNING WIND BLOWING ON MY BROW AND A FRESHNESS AS OF THE ROSE DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN INTO MY SOUL THEN I OPENED MY EYES AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP SAW THE REALITY BEFORE ME
A SINGULAR IMPUDENCE MINGLED WITH PITY THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IF SHE HAD TAKEN MY HAND IN THE STREET SHE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED A FEELING OF HORROR IN ME
OF A YOUNG GIRL IS FIXED ON THE DAY OF HER MARRIAGE THUS LITTLE BY LITTLE HE EXPRESSED WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AND I WATCHED BRIGITTE LISTENING TO HIM THEN WHEN HE AROSE TO LEAVE US I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE
AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOWS ON THE SUMMITS OF GLACIERS LET US GO LET US GO CRIED BRIGITTE LET US FLY AWAY LIKE TWO BIRDS LET US PRETEND MY DEAR OCTAVE THAT WE JUST MET EACH OTHER YESTERDAY
THAT SOUL AND THAT BODY ARE THY BROTHERS FOR SIX MONTHS THY MOUTH HAS NOT SPOKEN THY HEART HAS NOT THROBBED WITHOUT A RESPONSIVE WORD AND HEART BEAT FROM HER AND THAT WOMAN WHOM GOD HAS SENT THEE AS HE SENDS THE ROSE TO THE FIELD
WHOSE PRESENCE PORTENDS SHIPWRECK WHO HAS EVER TOLD THE STORY OF THE CHILDHOOD OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED STAINED WITH HUMAN BLOOD THEY ALSO HAVE BEEN GOOD IN THEIR DAY THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR FACES IN THEIR HANDS AND THINK OF THOSE HAPPY DAYS YOU DO EVIL AND YOU REPENT
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF GREATEST DESPAIR
WHICH HAS IN IT SOMETHING OF THE TERRORS OF EXILE AND THE HOPES OF A PILGRIMAGE ARE THERE NOT IN THE HUMAN MIND WINGS THAT FLUTTER AND SONOROUS CHORDS THAT VIBRATE HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE IT
LEANING OVER THE CRYSTAL WATERS OF A FOUNTAIN HAD A HEART NOT LESS PURE THAN THEY I CLOSED MY EYES AND THOUGHT OF MY CHILDHOOD DAYS AS A RAY OF LIGHT PIERCES A CLOUD A GLEAM FROM THE PAST PIERCED MY HEART NO I MUSED I DID NOT DO THAT
YOU WILL TOUCH WITH YOUR LEFT HAND THE WOUNDS THAT YOU INFLICT WITH YOUR RIGHT YOU WILL MAKE A SHROUD OF YOUR VIRTUE IN WHICH TO BURY YOUR CRIMES
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A STRANGE VOICE REPEATED AN OLD ROMANCE THAT I HAD LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN ALTRA VOLTA GIERI BIELE BLANCH E ROSSA COM UN FLORE MA ORA NO
FOR BRIGITTE LED HIM TO CENSURE THEM SEVERELY HE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY THEM HE SAID IF HE KNEW WHAT THEY CONTAINED
SHE OBSERVED MY EMOTION AND INQUIRED THE CAUSE I COULD NOT REPLY SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD SOME SECRET SORROW AND FOREBORE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE CAUSE
I AM A FOOL A MADMAN A CHILD WHO THINKS HIMSELF A MAN GOD BE PRAISED YOU ARE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL YOU LIVE AND YOU WILL FORGET ME
GOD THE JUICE OF A GRAPE CRUSHED UNDER THE FOOT SUFFICES TO DISSIPATE THE DEEPEST SORROW AND TO BREAK ALL THE INVISIBLE THREADS THAT THE FATES WEAVE ABOUT OUR PATHWAY WE WEEP LIKE WOMEN WE SUFFER LIKE MARTYRS
SLEEP IN PEACE I SAID TO HER GOD WATCHES OVER YOU WHILE YOUR LIPS WERE PARTING IN A SMILE YOU WERE IN GREATER DANGER THAN YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN BEFORE BUT THE HAND THAT THREATENED YOU WILL HARM NO ONE I SWEAR BY THE FAITH YOU PROFESS I WILL NOT KILL EITHER YOU OR MYSELF
ANOTHER ANOTHER I REPEATED BENDING OVER HER UNTIL MY HEAD TOUCHED HER SHOULDER IS SHE NOT A WIDOW HAS SHE NOT ALREADY SEEN DEATH HAVE NOT THESE LITTLE HANDS PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
I AM UNWILLING TO KILL THIS WOMAN SO I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO LEAVE HER IT IS ALL OVER I SHALL GO AWAY TO MORROW AND ALL THE WHILE I WAS THINKING NEITHER OF MY RESPONSIBILITY NOR OF THE PAST NOR FUTURE
FOR I BEAR ON MY HEART THE WOUND OF ALL THE EVIL I HAVE DONE YOU I HAVE BEEN AN INGRATE BLIND AND CRUEL GOD BE PRAISED YOU LOVE ME STILL
AND ADMIRATION AND LOVE RESUMED THEIR SWAY IN MY HEART BRIGITTE AND I EXAMINED A MAP TO DETERMINE WHERE WE SHOULD GO TO BURY OURSELVES FROM THE WORLD WE HAD NOT YET DECIDED
AS I HAD GULPED IT DOWN AT A BREATH DRUNKENNESS SEIZED ME PROMPTLY I FELT THAT I WAS BECOMING MUDDLED THEN I EXPERIENCED A LUCID MOMENT THEN CONFUSION FOLLOWED
SHE HOWEVER TOLD ME JUST WHAT I HAVE TOLD THE READER HIS LIFE HAD NEVER BEEN OTHER THAN IT WAS AT THIS TIME POOR OBSCURE AND HONEST
I FELT THAT THIS MUST BE THE EXPLANATION AND THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO ASSURE THEM THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE ONE FROM ALL DANGERS
REST ASSURED BRIGITTE NO ONE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER THAN I ANOTHER WILL LOVE YOU MORE WORTHILY NO ONE WILL LOVE YOU MORE TRULY ANOTHER WILL BE CONSIDERATE OF THOSE FEELINGS THAT I OFFEND HE WILL SURROUND YOU WITH HIS LOVE YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER LOVER YOU WILL NOT HAVE A BETTER BROTHER
WHILE THERE IS STILL SOME VIRTUE LEFT PROFIT BY IT IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT BECOME ALTOGETHER BAD WHILE A WOMAN YOU LOVE LIES THERE DYING ON THAT BED AND WHILE YOU HAVE A HORROR OF YOURSELF STRIKE THE DECISIVE BLOW SHE STILL LIVES THAT IS ENOUGH
WHO HOLDS IN HIS HAND THE DROP OF CONDENSED VAPOR AND WATCHES IT AS IT DRIES UP AS AN ANGLER WATCHES A GRAIN OF SAND IN HIS HAND THAT MIGHTY LAW OF ATTRACTION THAT SUSPENDS THE WORLD IN SPACE TORMENTS IT AND CONSUMES IT IN ENDLESS DESIRE
I SAW THAT MY PAST CONDUCT WHATEVER SHE MIGHT SAY OF IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER PRESENT STATE IF I HAD BEEN WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAT WE HAD LIVED TOGETHER
HAD HE RECOGNIZED ME AT THE OPERA OR HAD HE NOT HAD HE SHED TEARS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WHAT WOULD IT MATTER SO LONG AS I WAS HAPPY BUT WHILE UNABLE TO DIVINE THE CAUSE OF BRIGITTE'S SORROW
I WOULD NOT TOUCH YOU WITH THE TIP OF MY FINGER WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE REPLY AT ONCE IS IT MONEY YOU WANT WHAT PRICE DO YOU PUT ON YOUR PITY I AROSE AND TRIED TO GO OUT
HOW SHALL I TELL HOW DEEPLY I REPENTED MY CRUELTY WHEN I LOOKED UPON HER SMILING FACE
CONSUMATIS DAL AMORE MY SORROW WAS TOO GREAT I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND ONCE MORE BEGAN TO WALK THE FLOOR YES I CONTINUED LOOK AT HER THINK OF THOSE WHO ARE CONSUMED BY A GRIEF THAT IS NOT SHARED WITH ANOTHER
NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WAS PERSUADED COULD HAVE TROUBLED OUR LOVE SMITH WAS ONLY AN ORDINARY MAN BUT HE WAS GOOD AND DEVOTED HIS SIMPLE AND MODEST QUALITIES RESEMBLED THE LARGE PURE LINES
SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND WEPT WHEN I KISSED HER
SING MY DEAR I BEG OF YOU
I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEN I CLASPED MY HANDS TO PLEAD WITH WHOM
STANDING BEFORE HER APPARENTLY POINTING OUT WITH HIS IRON TIPPED STICK THE ROUTE OVER WHICH HE HAD COME HE WAS DIRECTING HER ATTENTION TO A WINDING PATH THAT LED TO THE MOUNTAIN ABOVE THEM WERE THE ALPS
AND MOST OF THEM ARE DECEIVED AS TO THE NATURE OF ITS ATTRACTIONS BUT IT IS THERE ARE UNFOLDED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS ON GOD'S EARTH
THESE THINGS ARE BUT AN ABSURD DREAM I RECALLED THE TIME WHEN I WAS IGNORANT OF LIFE WHEN I WAS TAKING MY FIRST STEPS IN EXPERIENCE I REMEMBERED AN OLD BEGGAR WHO USED TO SIT ON A STONE BENCH BEFORE THE FARM GATE TO WHOM I WAS SOMETIMES SENT WITH THE REMAINS OF OUR MORNING MEAL
IN PROPORTION AS THE WORLD GREW MORE SPLENDID AND PROSPEROUS FOR HIM WHERE IS THE WOMAN WHO WILL PATIENTLY ACQUIESCE IN THE RESERVE OF HER HUSBAND WHO SHARES HIS CONFIDENCE WITH ANOTHER
THAT LED THE WISE MEN AND THE CELESTIAL SONG HEARD BY THE SHEPHERDS KEEPING THEIR FLOCKS BY NIGHT AND SNATCHES OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY MADE A FEAST AND EAT THEIR PENNYWORTH OF CHERRIES SITTING ON THE STYLE HE TREATED HIM
YOU PERHAPS CAN TELL ANSWERED SHE COLDLY YOU HAVE FRIGHTENED RACHEL OUT OF THE ROOM FOR ONE THING ANSWERED HE WITH A SNEER I SIMPLY ASKED HER WHAT SHE URGED YOU TO DO I THINK I HAVE A CLAIM TO KNOW
AND THEN TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK AND SAUNTERED TOWARD GYLINGDEN AT THE POST OFFICE WINDOW HE TAPPED WITH THE SILVER TIP OF HIS CANE AND TOLD MISS DRIVER WITH A SLEEPY SMILE
AND THEN BACK AGAIN AND SO ON TRYING TO TIRE HIMSELF I THINK AND EVERY TIME HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS FACE TOWARD LONDON HIS YELLOW EYES GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARK AIR WITH THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN LOOKING OUT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF A VEHICLE
AND THIS SHE NEVER ADMITTED TO HERSELF BEFORE MORE PARTICULAR NO NOT EXACTLY THAT BUT MORE SOMETHING OR OTHER NOT EXACTLY EXPRESSIBLE IN WORDS IN HIS APPROACHES TO HER THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS SITUATION
AND MY YEARS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH I AM USUALLY TREATED I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE TONE IN WHICH YOU ARE PLEASED TO QUESTION ME THESE LAST TERRIBLE REMARKS TOTALLY FAILED TO OVERAWE THE SERENE TEMERITY OF THE GRAVE BEAUTY
THERE WAS A PAINFUL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THERE WAS GROWING IN DORCAS'S MIND A FEELING TOWARDS RACHEL WHICH HER PRIDE FORBADE HER TO DEFINE SHE DID NOT LIKE STANLEY'S STEALTHY VISITS TO REDMAN'S FARM
WE BOTH AGREED THAT YOU ARE TOO MUCH A RECLUSE IN THAT DER FRIESCHUTZ GLEN AT LEAST FOR YOUR FRIENDS PLEASURE AND OWE IT TO US ALL TO APPEAR NOW AND THEN IN THIS UPPER WORLD
UNEXTINGUISHABLE LOVE OF STORIES TO NO PURPOSE I DON'T ENVY THE MAN WHO IS SUPERIOR TO THE SOCIETY OF CHILDREN WHAT CAN HE GAIN FROM CHILDREN'S TALK IS IT WITTY OR WISE OR LEARNED BE FRANK IS IT NOT
THEN FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES HE SMOKED AN ODD RECREATION FOR A MAN SUFFERING FROM THE CIGARS OF LAST NIGHT AND AFTER THAT FOR NEARLY AS LONG AGAIN HE SEEMED LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT HIS EYES UPON THE MISTY GRASS BEFORE HIM AND HIS SMALL FRENCH
UNTIL AFTER THE MARRIAGE AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A ROOM AT THE HALL AND CAPITAL SHOOTING WHEN WE RETURN
THEREFORE I DON'T THINK HE WAS QUITE SO CAREFUL AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO SPARE LAKE THAT JOLT UPON THE ELBOW WHICH COMING FROM A RIVAL IN A MOMENT OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER EASY TO BEAR LIKE A CHRISTIAN
HAD HEARD FROM MARK WYLDER THAT MORNING A FEW LINES POSTPONING HIS RETURN HE MERELY MENTIONED IT AND MADE NO COMMENT BUT LAKE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE LAKE DINED AT BRANDON THAT EVENING AND THOUGH LOOKING ILL WAS
HOW OFTEN HAD STANLEY LAKE SWORN TO HER THERE WAS NO SECRET THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF MARK WYLDER BEYOND THE CHARGE OF HIS MONEY AND MAKING A SMALL PAYMENT TO AN OLD MISSUS DUTTON IN LONDON BY HIS DIRECTION
I DO SUSPECK SIR MOST SERIOUS AS HOW THEY HAVE PUT MISTER MARK WYLDER INTO A MAD HOUSE AND THAT'S HOW I THINK IT'S GONE WITH HIM AN YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM OUT AGAIN IF THE CAPTING HAS HIS WILL DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
AND THAT BEAUTIFUL LOOK OF GRATIFICATION SO BECOMING AND INDESCRIBABLE HAPPY THAT MOMENT THAT ENCHANTED MOMENT OF OBLIVION AND ILLUSION BUT THE FITFUL EVENING BREEZE CAME UP THROUGH REDMAN'S DELL WITH A GENTLE SWEEP OVER THE AUTUMNAL FOLIAGE
AND WAS OVER SO QUICKLY LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER SOME HAD NOT SEEN ANY AND OTHERS ONLY A BIT OF IT
SHE PERFECTLY WELL KNEW THAT NOTHING OF IT ESCAPED HIM THE SIGHT OF THAT PALE FACE WAS A COLD PANG AT HER HEART A FACE PROPHETIC OF EVIL AT SIGHT OF WHICH THE DARK CURTAIN WHICH HID FUTURITY
YES MY GOOD CLIENT MISTER MARK WYLDER PERMIT ME TO ASSIST YOU TO SOME HONEY YOU'LL FIND IT REMARKABLY GOOD I VENTURE TO SAY IT COMES FROM THE GARDENS OF QUEEN'S AUDLEY THE LATE MARQUIS YOU KNOW PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS HONEY
WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO LADY CHELFORD THAT IS HER SON LORD CHELFORD OH SAID BUTTLE WHOSE SMIRK VANISHED ON THE INSTANT IN A VERY RED AND DISMAL VACANCY I
THANK YOU SAID HE TO THE MAID SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF SMILE THAT WILL DO WHAT CONFOUNDED NONSENSE HE'LL BE QUITE COOL AGAIN IN FIVE MINUTES NEVER MIND
NEBULOUS IN HOVERING FOLDS OF SNOWY MUSLIN AND SHE FLOATED DOWN LIKE A CLOUD UPON THE OTTOMAN BESIDE OLD LADY SARAH AND SMILED AND LEANED TOWARDS HER AND TALKED IN HER SWEET LOW DISTINCT ACCENTS
SHE TURNED INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM AT THE LEFT AND HERSELF UNSEEN DID TAKE THAT LAST LOOK AND SAW HIM GO UP THE ROAD AGAIN TOWARDS BRANDON THE SHADOWS AND MISTS OF REDMAN'S DELL ANTICIPATED NIGHT AND IT WAS ALREADY DEEP TWILIGHT THERE
IN WHITE CHOKER AND SEEDY BLACK
NO NOTHING BUT A DISPLAY OF HIS TEMPER AND MORALS NOT VERY ASTONISHING AFTER ALL AND LIKE AN UGLY PICTURE OR A DREADFUL DREAM IN NO WAY TO AFFECT HER AFTER LIFE EXCEPT AS AN ODIOUS REMEMBRANCE THEREFORE LITTLE BY LITTLE
A TRUE ALLEGORY I MEAN TAMAR DEATH WILL CLOSE THE EYES AND EARS AGAINST THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF EARTH BUT EVEN THE TOMB SECURES NO SECRECY THE DEAD THEMSELVES DECLARE THEIR DREADFUL SECRETS OPEN MOUTHED TO THE WINDS
NOW DISCUSSING AN ENGAGEMENT OF MORE THAN TWO MONTHS STANDING OR A MARRIAGE WHICH IS FIXED TO TAKE PLACE ONLY TEN DAYS HENCE AND I THINK SIR GLANCING AGAIN AT ME IT MUST STRIKE YOU A LITTLE ODDLY
AND READ TO US NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF POETRY I FORGET WHAT MY BOOK EXCEPT WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THE TARN AND THAT OLD MAN I SO HATED WAS MISS BRANDON'S EXQUISITE AND MYSTERIOUS FACE THAT YOUNG LADY WAS LEANING BACK IN HER GREAT OAK CHAIR
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN SAID RACHEL WHO IN THE MIDST OF THIS CROWDED GOSSIPING BALL ROOM WAS TALKING MUCH MORE FREELY TO STANLEY AND ALSO STRANGE TO SAY IN MORE SISTERLY FASHION
CROTCHET TO RUIN POOR RADIE I FANCY I'M DOING JUST WHAT YOU BOTH BID ME SAID THE OLD WOMAN YOU SIT UP STAIRS CHIEFLY SHE NODDED SADLY AND KEEP THE HALL DOOR SHUT AND BOLTED
STILL STOOD IN MEMORY AT THE DOOR IN HIS BLACK SHORTS AND GAITERS WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A PUCKERED SMILE ON HIS HARD RUDDY COUNTENANCE AS I APPROACHED HE SMILED LITTLE ON OTHERS I BELIEVE
AND HE POINTED TO THE TIMES MISTER LARCOM'S FAT FACE SMILED IN SPITE OF HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP IT UNDER IT WAS PART OF HIS BUSINESS TO LOOK ALWAYS GRAVE AND HE COUGHED AND RECOVERED HIS GRAVITY I'M VERY THANKFUL SIR SAID MISTER LARCOM VERY
WE BOTH KNOW DORCAS VERY WELL SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS SHE DOES NOT ENCOURAGE FELLOWS AS THEY DO BUT IF SHE DID NOT LIKE BRACTON VERY WELL INDEED SHE WOULD SEND HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS SHE HAS DANCED WITH HIM TWICE
BUT DORCAS'S MIND RETAINED ITS FIRST IMPRESSION SOMETIMES HIS PLAUSIBILITIES HIS VEHEMENCE AND HIS VOWS DISTURBED IT FOR A TIME BUT THERE IT REMAINED LIKE THE PICTURE OF A CAMERA OBSCURA
THESE INDEED WERE EVEN IN STANLEY'S CHILDHOOD OLD WORLD HAZY TRADITIONS OF THE SERVANTS HALL BUT BOYS HEAR OFTEN MORE THAN IS GOOD AND MORE THAN GOSPEL WHO LIVE IN SUCH HOUSES AS OLD GENERAL LAKE THE OLD MILLIONAIRE WIDOWER KEPT
LIKE A ROMANTIC REVERIE AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE CHAISE WINDOWS EVERY MOMENT PRESENTED SOME GROUP OR OUTLINE OR HOMELY OBJECT FOR YEARS FORGOTTEN AND NOW WITH A STRANGE SURPRISE HOW VIVIDLY REMEMBERED AND HOW AFFECTIONATELY GREETED
BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS AGAINST IT SO THAT HANDSOME COIN REMAINED IN HIS PURSE AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU TAMAR I'VE A RING FOR YOU IN TOWN A LITTLE SOUVENIR YOU'LL THINK IT PRETTY A GOLD RING WITH A STONE IN IT
BUT THINK WHAT YOU MAY IT MUST BE DONE HAVE NOT YOU READ OF STRAINING AT GNATS AND SWALLOWING CAMELS YOU USED NOT I'VE HEARD TO BE ALWAYS SO SCRUPULOUS OLD TAMAR THERE WAS A VILE SARCASM IN HIS TONE AND LOOK
UNTIL THE OLD BRANDON TYPE REAPPEARED
NO WYLDER WAS AN ENERGETIC AND SOMEWHAT VIOLENT PERSON WITH HIGH ANIMAL COURAGE AND WOULD BE SURE TO BLOW UP AND BREAK THROUGH ANY SUCH MACHINATION NO NO
MISTER LARKIN WALKED DOWN DIRECT TO GYLINGDEN AND PAID A RATHER AWFUL VISIT TO MISTER DRIVER OF THE POST OFFICE A FOREIGN LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM HAD MOST POSITIVELY BEEN LOST HE HAD CALLED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE LEST MISTER DRIVER SHOULD BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
I ALMOST FANCY THESE GYLINGDEN PEOPLE DULL AS THEY ARE
SEEMED TO SWAY AND TREMBLE AS IF A HAND FROM BEHIND WAS ON THE POINT OF DRAWING IT RACHEL SIGHED PROFOUNDLY AND HER EYES LOOKED SADLY THROUGH HER BOUQUET ON THE FLOOR
HE LOOKED OVER THE BANISTERS DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW BENEATH AND THERE MARCHING UP RESOLUTELY
ELPHICK I GATHER TOOK FRIGHT FROM YOU AND WENT TO CARDLESTONE THEN THEY BOTH VANISHED IT MAY BE THAT CARDLESTONE DID KILL MAITLAND I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE I FELT SURE THAT YOU WOULD LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED NO CORNER UNEXPLORED REPLIED MISTER ELPHICK THE CURIOSITY OF THE MODERN PRESSMAN IS INSATIABLE SPARGO STIFFENED
AND OF WHAT WAS HE CONVICTED OH OF COURSE WE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT NOW AS SOON AS WE FOUND OUT WHO HE REALLY WAS WE HAD ALL THE PARTICULARS TURNED UP AYLMORE OR AINSWORTH STEPHEN AINSWORTH HIS NAME REALLY IS
AND THAT'S HOW I CAME TO HANDLE IT SIR I SEE SAID SPARGO A GOOD EXPLANATION
AND SPARGO SUDDENLY REALIZED WITH A SHARP QUICKENING OF HIS PULSES
AND I SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU KNOW OF IT YOU'LL BE THERE GOD BLESS ME EXCLAIMED MISTER QUARTERPAGE YOU'VE REALLY DONE THAT WELL WELL SO WE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AT LAST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
MY WORK SAID RATHBURY PROUDLY MY WORK MY SON YOU SEE I THOUGHT A LOT AND ESPECIALLY AFTER WE'D FOUND OUT THAT MARBURY WAS MAITLAND YOU MEAN AFTER I'D FOUND OUT REMARKED SPARGO RATHBURY WAVED HIS CIGAR
AND LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW THE BLANK ASTONISHMENT WHICH STOLE OVER HIS HEARERS FACES
BUT IN ANOTHER ARMCHAIR ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH WAS THE FORBIDDING FIGURE OF MISS BAYLIS BLACKER GLOOMIER MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN EVER SHE NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED WHEN SPARGO ENTERED SHE DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM
WHEREAS ON SOME DATE WITHIN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS THERE WAS STOLEN ABSTRACTED OR TAKEN FROM THE CHAMBERS IN FOUNTAIN COURT TEMPLE
NOW FIRST
SHALL YOU GO ASKED BRETON CERTAINLY AND YOU CAN GO WITH ME IF YOU LIKE BETTER KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US ALL DAY IN CASE WE HEAR YOU OUGHT TO BE THERE YOU'RE CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO GO
WAS THAT ALL THREE DROVE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LEGAL GENTLEMAN WHO CATERED FOR THE WATCHMAN WHEN IT WANTED ANY LAW AND THAT THINGS WERE PUT IN SHAPE FOR AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION TO THE HOME OFFICE
ONE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING AT ONCE AND IN CASH TO WHOSOEVER WILL PROVE THAT HE OR SHE STOLE ABSTRACTED OR TOOK AWAY THE SAID STICK FROM THE SAID CHAMBERS
THIS MAN KNOWS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN A GREAT DEAL BEYOND THE MERE FACT THAT MARBURY WAS MAITLAND AND THAT RONALD BRETON IS IN REALITY MAITLAND'S SON
SPARGO CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF NAMES THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S AMONGST THEM
WE'LL GO AND SEE ABOUT YOUR LITTLE REWARD EXCUSE ME BRETON BRETON KICKED HIS HEELS IN SOLITUDE FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN SPARGO CAME BACK THERE
A QUANTITY OF PAPERS RELATING TO CLOUDHAMPTON AND THE HEARTH AND HOME MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETY WERE REVEALED HE GAVE A HASTY GLANCE AT THESE AND DREW BRETON ASIDE
AND FRIGHT CARDLESTONE STILL SAT IN HIS CORNER SHIVERING AND TREMBLING HE LOOKED INCAPABLE OF EXPLAINING ANYTHING ELPHICK WAS SCARCELY MORE FITTED TO SPEAK
THAT'S ANOTHER FACT HOW ASKED BRETON STERNLY CAN YOU PROVE IT HOW DO YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE REPLIED MYERST WITH A CUNNING GRIN
ANSWERED EDWARD MOLLISON LEASTWAYS THAT'S WHERE I GENERALLY HANG OUT WHEN I CAN AFFORD IT AND WINDOW CLEANER LEASTWAYS I WAS WINDOW CLEANING WHEN
WAS IT MOLLISON APPEARED TO FIND THIS DIRECT QUESTION SOOTHING TO HIS FEELINGS HE SMILED WEAKLY IT WAS CERT'NLY ME AS TOOK IT SIR HE SAID NOT THAT I MEANT TO PINCH
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE I KNOW THAT COTTAGE THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS THIS WE MUST CATCH MYERST UNAWARES HE'S HERE FOR NO GOOD LOOK HERE
AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT CHAMBERLAYNE IS ACTUALLY ALIVE MISTER SPARGO SPARGO PULLED OUT HIS WATCH WE SHALL ALL KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURIED IN THAT GRAVE BEFORE ANOTHER SIX HOURS ARE OVER MISTER QUARTERPAGE HE SAID HE MIGHT WELL HAVE SPOKEN OF FOUR HOURS INSTEAD OF SIX FOR IT WAS
IT STRIKES ME WE'VE FOUND A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WE EVER BARGAINED FOR HE EXCLAIMED DIDN'T AYLMORE SAY THAT THE REAL CULPRIT AT CLOUDHAMPTON WAS ANOTHER MAN HIS CLERK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HE DID AGREED BRETON HE INSISTS ON IT THEN THIS FELLOW CHAMBERLAYNE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAN SAID SPARGO HE CAME TO MARKET MILCASTER FROM THE NORTH
I'LL EXPLAIN NOW IF YOU CARE TO HEAR SAID MYERST WITH ANOTHER OF HIS CYNICAL LAUGHS AND IF I DO I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH I KNOW YOU'VE GOT AN IDEA IN YOUR HEADS THAT ISN'T FAVOURABLE TO ME BUT YOU'RE UTTERLY WRONG
A DREADFUL THING IF THERE IS A DEAD MAN THERE SAID SPARGO
RONALD BRETON IS THE SON OF THE MURDERED MAN AND RONALD BRETON IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH THE MURDER DO YOU HEAR THAT
WE HAVE TO BE UP AT DAYBREAK AND POSSIBLY YOU TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE UP JUST AS EARLY MISTER QUARTERPAGE LOOKED AN ENQUIRY OVER THE TOP OF A DECANTER WHICH HE WAS HANDLING AT DAYBREAK HE EXCLAIMED THE FACT IS SAID SPARGO THAT GRAVE OF CHAMBERLAYNE'S IS GOING TO BE OPENED AT DAYBREAK
HE SPARGO TURNED SHARPLY ON MYERST YOU SAY ELPHICK DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL LAST NIGHT HE EXCLAIMED WHY THEN THIS RUNNING AWAY WHAT WERE THEY RUNNING FROM
THEN BRETON NODDED LET HIM TALK IF HE LIKES HE SAID WE'RE NOT BOUND TO BELIEVE HIM AND WE MAY HEAR SOMETHING THAT'S TRUE
SAID MYERST WITH ANOTHER SNEERING LAUGH AND ON WHAT CHARGE DO YOU PROPOSE TO HAND ME OVER TO THE POLICE IT STRIKES ME YOU'LL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN FORMULATING ONE MISTER BRETON WELL SEE ABOUT THAT LATER
EXCLAIMED MYERST ANSWER ME THAT OR RATHER LET THEM ANSWER IF THEY DARE HERE YOU CARDLESTONE YOU ELPHICK
IN YOUR OWN CASE YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF SOME ABSURD NOTION THAT THE MAN JOHN MARBURY WAS IN REALITY ONE JOHN MAITLAND ONCE OF MARKET MILCASTER
ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN SITTING HERE DOING NOTHING
BY THAT TIME EXCEPT ONE THING THAT PACKET OF AUSTRALIAN STAMPS AND I FOUND OUT THAT THOSE STAMPS WERE IN THE HANDS OF
SAID BRETON BEGINNING TO RUMMAGE THEY'VE GENERALLY HAD A GOOD STOCK OF TINNED THINGS HERE WE ARE SPARGO THESE ARE TONGUES AND SARDINES
AND BRETON POINTED SPARGO TO AN OLD CORNER CUPBOARD SPARGO HE SAID I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'LL FIND WHISKY IN THERE GIVE THEM BOTH A STIFF DOSE THEY'VE BROKEN UP NOW GUARDIAN HE CONTINUED
IT IS FACT FACT MISTER ELPHICK SLOWLY TURNED HIS FACE TO MISS BAYLIS HE GASPED OUT A FEW WORDS
SAID SPARGO ELEVEN SHARP HE WAS MOVING AWAY WHEN ELPHICK CAUGHT HIM BY THE SLEEVE A WORD JUST A WORD HE SAID YOU YOU HAVE NOT TOLD THE THE BOY RONALD OF WHAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T REPLIED SPARGO
MARCHED STRAIGHT DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND KNOCKED BOLDLY AT MISTER ELPHICK'S DOOR GREATLY TO SPARGO'S SURPRISE THE DOOR WAS OPENED BEFORE THERE WAS ANY NECESSITY TO KNOCK AGAIN AND THERE CALMLY CONFRONTING HIM
RATHBURY LAUGHED NO HE SAID THROWING THE NEWSPAPER ASIDE I DIDN'T I CAME TO TELL YOU MY LATEST YOU'RE AT FULL LIBERTY TO STICK IT INTO YOUR PAPER TONIGHT IT MAY JUST AS WELL BE KNOWN WELL SAID SPARGO
HIS COUNTENANCE USUALLY SUBDUED TO AN OFFICIAL STOLIDITY SHOWED SIGNS OF SOMETHING VERY LIKE EXCITEMENT
SO THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER KNOW OF YOUR FATHER'S DISGRACE ELPHICK NEVER KNEW UNTIL LAST NIGHT THAT CARDLESTONE IS CHAMBERLAYNE EVEN THE BIGGEST SCOUNDRELS HAVE FRIENDS ELPHICK'S VERY FOND OF
WALK FORWARD INTO MY SITTING ROOM SPARGO MUCH ASTONISHED AT THIS RECEPTION PASSED THROUGH AN ANTE ROOM INTO A HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT FULL OF BOOKS AND PICTURES
LA PALISSE FELL IN WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT BAYARD TO WHOM HE SAID MY COMRADE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU NOT LIKE US TO BE COMRADES TOGETHER BAYARD WHO ASKED NOTHING BETTER ANSWERED HIM GRACIOUSLY THAT HE WAS AT HIS SERVICE TO BE DISPOSED OF AT HIS PLEASURE
THE ADMIRAL DE BRABANT AND A HUNDRED OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS KNIGHTS SET OUT IN PURSUIT BUT WERE UNABLE TO COME UP IN TIME
WHO SAID NO MORE THAN WELCOME LORD NEXT DAY APRIL ELEVENTH
THE VENETIANS RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT THE VENTURE DURING THE NIGHT BETWEEN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH OF JULY A SMALL DETACHMENT WELL ARMED AND WELL LED ARRIVED BENEATH THE WALLS OF PADUA WHICH WAS RATHER CARELESSLY GUARDED IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS THE GATE WAS OPENED
LOUIS D'ARMAGNAC DUKE OF NEMOURS A BRAVE WARRIOR BUT A NEGOTIATOR INCLINED TO TAKE UMBRAGE AND TO GIVE OFFENCE THE DISPUTES SOON TOOK THE FORM OF HOSTILITIES THE FRENCH ESSAYED TO DRIVE THE SPANIARDS FROM THE POINTS THEY HAD OCCUPIED IN THE DISPUTED TERRITORIES
BUT VENICE MAY NOT BE DESERTED BY HER PUBLIC BODIES WHICH PROTECT AND DEFEND PADUA BY THEIR FORETHOUGHT AND THEIR ORDERS JUST AS OTHERS DO BY THEIR ARMS AND A USELESS MOB OF GRAYBEARDS WOULD BE A BURDEN MUCH MORE THAN A REENFORCEMENT THERE
AND WHEN THE MERCENARY SOLDIERS WHO ARE THERE SEE HOW PROMPT ARE OUR YOUTH TO GUARD THE GATES AND EVERYWHERE FACE THE BATTLE THEY WILL BE MOVED THEREBY TO ZEAL AND ALACRITY INCALCULABLE AND NOT ONLY WILL PADUA THUS BE DEFENDED AND SAVED
HE STRUGGLED TO HIS KNEES BUT THE FELLOWS STRUCK AT HIM HEAVILY WITH AXE AND SWORD A YOUNG MAN IN HIS TRAIN MADE AN EFFORT TO DEFEND HIM AND WAS IMMEDIATELY CUT DOWN AND ANOTHER GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
WENT THITHER TO LOOK AND HE MARVELLED AND THOUGHT IT GREAT SHAME TO HIM WITH THE NUMBER OF MEN HE HAD THAT HE HAD NOT SOONER DELIVERED THE ASSAULT ON RETURNING TO HIS QUARTERS HE SENT FOR A FRENCH SECRETARY OF HIS WHOM HE BADE WRITE TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE A LETTER
THEY HEARD THAT THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF PADUA WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN WAS UTTERING PASSIONATE MURMURS AGAINST ITS NEW MASTER AND WISHED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO COME BACK BENEATH THE OLD SWAY AND IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION SHOWN BY THE DOGE LOREDANO
AFTER SEVERAL OTHER ACTS OF REPARATION WHICH WERE IMPOSED UPON HIM HE WAS TO BE SENT INTO EXILE FOR TWENTY YEARS BEYOND THE SEAS AND ON HIS RETURN TO REMAIN AT TWENTY LEAGUES DISTANCE AT LEAST FROM THE KING AND THE ROYAL FAMILY
BETTER OR SAFER COUNSEL FOR HIM HE HAD NOT TO GIVE AFTER TAKING SOME PRECAUTIONS ON THE SCORE OF HIS ELDEST SON PRINCE FERDINAND WHOM HE LEFT AT TARENTO IN THE KINGDOM HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE IS A MAN OF SUCH MIGHTY POWER THAT JUSTICE CANNOT WELL BE DONE BY THE SOVEREIGN THIS PRINCIPLE ONCE LAID DOWN JOHN PETIT PROCEEDED TO APPLY IT TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY CAUSING TO BE SLAIN THAT CRIMINAL TYRANT THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
THE SAME WHO HAD BUT LATELY OPPOSED THE SURPRISAL OF PADUA ROSE UP AND DELIVERED IN THE SENATE A LONG SPEECH OF WHICH ONLY THE ESSENTIAL AND CHARACTERISTIC POINTS CAN BE QUOTED HERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EXCELLENT GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE SAID HE
LET THEM HAVE AN INKLING THAT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION OF SOME NEW DESIGN
IT WAS A GLOOMY NIGHT NOT A SOUL IN THE STREETS WHEN THE DUKE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES FROM THE QUEEN'S HOSTEL EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ARMED MEN WHO HAD LAIN IN AMBUSH BEHIND A HOUSE
HIS PRIVATE LIFE WAS REGULAR AND STAID AMIDST THE SCANDALOUS LICENTIOUSNESS OF HIS COURT HE WAS OF THOSE WHO LEAVE BEHIND THEM UNFEIGNED REGRET AND AN HONORED MEMORY
BUT AT THE FOUNTAIN INN YOU WILL TELL ME THAT SO GREAT A KING OUGHT NOT TO PUT UP AT AN INN BUT I SHALL ANSWER YOU THAT IN THIS DISTRICT OF ETAMPES THE BEST HOUSES ARE AS YET THE INNS THERE IS CERTAINLY A ROYAL CASTLE IN THE WHICH LIVES THE QUEEN THE WIFE OF THE DECEASED KING
THE KING SAYS GUICCIARDINI DEPARTED FROM ITALY CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM TO FRANCE GREAT GLORY BY REASON OF SO COMPLETE AND SO RAPIDLY WON A VICTORY OVER THE VENETIANS NEVERTHELESS AS IN THE CASE OF THINGS OBTAINED AFTER HOPE LONG DEFERRED
SUDDENLY DECIDED UPON PUTTING INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY A GREAT NUMBER OF GENTLEMEN FROM THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD WERE PRESENT TO MEET HIM
OF THE NOBLEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THIS GENEROUS ADVICE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FATHERS AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SONS WITH THAT EARNEST PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ARDOR WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RESOLUTION OF GREAT SOULS
IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THROUGH THE QUEEN'S INFLUENCE
CAPUA AND AVERSA FOLLOWED ITS EXAMPLE GAETA WAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT PLACE WHICH STILL HELD OUT FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTAINED A GARRISON CAPABLE OF DEFENDING IT AND THITHER THE REMNANT OF THE TROOPS BEATEN AT SEMINARA AND AT CERIGNOLA
WITHOUT BELT OR CHAPERON AND DISAVOW SOLEMNLY AND PUBLICLY ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE ROYAL FAMILY AND ALSO ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED
IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS GRUDGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VENETIANS DEMEANOR TOWARDS HIM
ALL THE OTHER PLACES WERE GIVEN UP BY TRAITORS OR SURRENDERED WITHOUT A SHOW OF RESISTANCE THE VENETIANS HAD THE SAME SUCCESS ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER OF THE DUCHY MILAN AND CREMONA ALONE REMAINED TO BE OCCUPIED LUDOVIC SFORZA
I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TO THAT WHICH THE EMPEROR SHALL BE PLEASED TO COMMAND
AND AT FIRST THEY HAD THE ADVANTAGE GONZALVO OF CORDOVA FROM NECESSITY OR IN PRUDENCE CONCENTRATED HIS FORCES WITHIN BARLETTA A LITTLE FORTRESS WITH A LITTLE PORT ON THE ADRIATIC
DISPUTES AROSE BETWEEN THE TWO GENERALS AS TO THE MEANING OF CERTAIN CLAUSES IN THE TREATY OF NOVEMBER ELEVENTH FIFTEEN HUNDRED
ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST FOURTEEN O EIGHT QUEEN ISABEL RETURNED THITHER FROM MELUN WITH THE DAUPHIN LOUIS WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME RODE ON HORSEBACK AND WITH THREE THOUSAND MEN AT ARMS SHE SET UP HER ESTABLISHMENT AT THE LOUVRE
LOUIS CONCLUDED ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH FIFTEEN O FOUR A TRUCE FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE KING OF SPAIN
THERE HAD GROWN UP BETWEEN QUEEN ISABEL OF BAVARIA AND LOUIS DUKE OF ORLEANS BROTHER OF THE KING AN INTIMACY WHICH THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND AMONGST ALL HONORABLE PEOPLE SHOCKED EVEN THE LEAST STRAIT LACED
THE FORTUNE OF OUR CITY SO WILLED IT THAT IN THE SPACE OF A FEW DAYS OUR EMPIRE SLIPPED FROM OUR HANDS THE OPPORTUNITY HAS COME BACK TO US OF RECOVERING WHAT WE HAVE LOST BY SPONTANEOUSLY FACING THE CHANGES AND CHANCES OF FATE WE SHALL PROVE THAT OUR DISASTERS
AND LORD LUDOVICO HAD HIM ARMED BEFORE HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS ACCOUTRED THE YOUNG KNIGHT LEAPED UPON HIS HORSE WITHOUT PUTTING FOOT TO STIRRUP
VOLATILE GOOD NATURED HE HAD FOR HIS PARTISANS AT COURT ALL THOSE WHO SHARED HIS WORSE THAN FRIVOLOUS TASTES AND HABITS AND HIS POLITICAL JUDGMENT WAS NO BETTER THAN HIS HABITS NO SOONER WAS HE INVESTED WITH POWER
IN ONE OF THE FIGHTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS SUDDEN REVOLUTION THE YOUNG CHEVALIER BAYARD CARRIED AWAY BY THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS AGE AND COURAGE PURSUED RIGHT INTO MILAN THE FOES HE WAS DRIVING BEFORE HIM WITHOUT NOTICING
CAUSED INEXPRESSIBLE JOY IN VENICE AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS THERE WAS SEEN A GLEANS OF HOPE THE VENETIANS HASTENED TO PROVISION PADUA WELL AND TO PUT IT IN A STATE OF DEFENCE
THE AUSTRIAN GARRISON HURRIED UP AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT OTHER VENETIAN TROOPS ARRIVED AND THE GARRISON WAS BEATEN AND SURRENDERED PADUA BECAME VENETIAN AGAIN
THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY WHO HAD RECOVERED ALL HIS AUDACITY CAME TO TAKE HIS SEAT THERE WORD WAS SENT TO HIM NOT TO ENTER THE ROOM DUKE JOHN PERSISTED
BUT HE WAS COARSE VOLATILE INCONSISTENT AND NOT VERY ABLE
HIDDEN OPPOSITION IN THE VERY MIDST OF JOINT ACTION AND AFTERWARDS OPEN TREASON AND DEFECTION HE FORGOT MOREOVER THAT FERDINAND HAD AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMIES A TRIED CHIEFTAIN GONZALVO OF CORDOVA ALREADY KNOWN THROUGHOUT EUROPE AS THE GREAT CAPTAIN
THE FRENCH ARMY WAS DISPERSING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF SHELTER AND PROVISIONS
AND ORDERED ITS COMMANDANTS TO EVACUATE SUCH PLACES AS THEY STILL HELD NEARLY ALL SUCH SUBMITTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE TO THE VICTOR OF AGNADELLO AND HIS ALLIES OF CAMBRAI BUT AT TREVISO WHEN EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN'S COMMISSIONER PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT
HE FOUNDED THAT GREAT HOUSE OF BURGUNDY WHICH WAS FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY TO ECLIPSE AND OFTEN TO DEPLORABLY COMPROMISE FRANCE BUT PHILIP THE BOLD LOVED FRANCE SINCERELY AND ALWAYS GAVE HER THE CHIEF PLACE IN HIS POLICY
BUT NOW THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DONE THE HEIGHT OF NOBILITY IN THE PRESENT DAY IS TO FREQUENT BAGNIOS TO LIVE IN DEBAUCHERY TO WEAR RICH DRESSES WITH PRETTY FRINGES AND BIG CUFFS THIS O QUEEN HE ADDED
SHE SET OUT FOR BLOIS WITH HER CHILDREN BEING RESOLVED TO FORTIFY HERSELF THERE CHARLES HAD ANOTHER RELAPSE OF HIS MALADY THE PEOPLE OF PARIS WHO WERE RATHER FAVORABLE THAN ADVERSE TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LAID THE BLAME OF THE KING'S NEW ATTACK
WE REGARD THE DEED RELATING TO OUR OWN BROTHER AS DONE TO OURSELF THE COMPASSION OF ALL PRESENT WAS BOUNDLESS AND SO WAS THEIR INDIGNATION BUT IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN TO PARIS
I AM GLAD WE HAVE DISCOVERED HIM YES SAID MISSUS MACLNTYRE AND WHEN THIS LITTLE TRAMP IS SENT AWAY I WANT THE CHILDREN TO GO THERE OFTEN I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD NOT TEACH THEM THIS SPRING AT LEAST MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THEM IN NATURAL HISTORY
WE'LL TELL HER THAT WE HAVE A VALENTINE SIX FEET LONG AND KEEP HER GUESSING THERE WAS NO TIME FOR TEASING HOWEVER AS THE FIRST GUEST ARRIVED WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN THE BLUE ROOM I HATE TO GO OFF AND LEAVE HIM IN THE DARK SAID KEITH
THE VALENTINE PARTY NOW WE CAN TELL GINGER ABOUT THE BEAR WAS KEITH'S FIRST REMARK WHEN HE AWOKE EARLY NEXT MORNING
IT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE HIM FROM GROWING UP TO BE A CRIMINAL LIKE THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE I SHALL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A CHILD OF THE SLUMS MALCOLM AND KEITH REPEATED THE EXPRESSION AFTERWARD
SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT MALCOLM FOUND THE TRAMP'S PICTURE IN THE COURIER JOURNAL HE WAS A NOTED CRIMINAL WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM A NORTHERN PENITENTIARY SOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE AND HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE LOUISVILLE POLICE
THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE SOME TIME BEFORE THE BOYS REMEMBERED THEIR PROMISE TO MEET THEM AT THE STATION WHEN THEY SAW HOW LATE IT WAS THEY STARTED HOME ON THE RUN I AM FAIRLY ACHING TO TELL GINGER ABOUT THAT BEAR PANTED KEITH AS THEY REACHED THE SIDE DOOR
LIKE A WILD BIRD IN A CAGE AND SOMETIMES THE LONGING FOR LIBERTY WHICH HER MOTHER HAD ALLOWED HER MADE HER FRET AGAINST THE THOUSAND LITTLE PROPRIETIES SHE HAD TO OBSERVE SOMETIMES WHEN SHE WENT TIPPING OVER THE POLISHED FLOORS OF THE LONG DRAWING ROOM AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF HERSELF IN ONE OF THE BIG MIRRORS
SHE DREW HER HAND HASTILY ACROSS HER EYES AND WENT ON THIS ONE IS FOR SERGEANT JACKSON OUT AT FORT DENNIS AND THE BIGGEST ONE WITH THE DOVES FOR COLONEL PHILIPS AND HIS WIFE DEAR ME I WISH I COULD SEND ONE TO EVERY OFFICER AND SOLDIER OUT THERE
THEY WERE HALF WAY HOME WHEN A HAPPY THOUGHT CAME TO MALCOLM KEITH HE CRIED EXCITEDLY IF YOU WOULD PUT YOUR MONEY WITH MINE THAT WOULD MAKE FOUR DOLLARS
FOR FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW HE FOUND SOME TRACKS PRESENTLY AND FOLLOWED THEM OVER THE MEADOW IN THE STARLIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD AND DOWN THE RAILROAD TRACK SEVERAL RODS THERE THEY SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
AND LACE PAPER NAPKINS WITH VERSES ON THEM SO THAT THE TABLE ITSELF WILL LOOK LIKE A LOVELY BIG VALENTINE THE GAMES ARE LOVELY TOO ONE IS PARLOUR ARCHERY WITH A RED HEART IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TARGET AND TWO PRIZES
COULDN'T YOU RAISE ANY MORE MONEY THAN THAT IT WAS MALCOLM'S TURN TO SHAKE HIS HEAD HE TURNED AWAY TOO DISAPPOINTED TO TRUST HIMSELF TO ANSWER ANY OTHER WAY THE TEARS SPRANG TO KEITH'S EYES
ONE FOR THE BOYS AND ONE FOR THE GIRLS WHO ARE INVITED ASKED MALCOLM AS VIRGINIA STOPPED FOR BREATH
IT WAS OF DAINTY WHITE TULLE SPRINKLED WITH HUNDREDS OF TINY RED VELVET HEARTS AND THERE WAS A CORONET OF GLITTERING RHINESTONES ON HER LONG FAIR HAIR THE QUEEN OF HEARTS ANNOUNCED AUNT ALLISON LEADING HER FORWARD
AND MIGHT HELP HIM TO FORGET HIS SUFFERING
THEY SUT'N'LY IS THE HANDSOMEST COUPLE EVAH JINED TOGETHAH AN THE FREE HANDEDEST IN ALL THEY TRAVELS BY SEA OR BY LAND THEY NEVAH FO'GITS OLE DAPHNE I'VE GOT THINGS FROM EVERY COUNTRY UNDAH THE SHININ SUN WHAT THEY DONE BRUNG ME
DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND CRAWLED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION JUST AS THE PROFESSOR BURST OPEN THE DOOR THE SIGHT OF THE POOR LITTLE BLISTERED FACE BROUGHT THE TEARS TO MISS ALLISON'S EYES AND SHE CALLED TWO OF THE COLOURED MEN
SHE EXCLAIMED PRESENTLY PICKING UP A FANCY BOX WHICH SHE HAD TOSSED ON THE BED WHEN SHE FIRST CAME IN
I WISH WE HADN'T THOUGH SAID KEITH AGAIN BUT IT'S DONE NOW PERSISTED MALCOLM WE'RE BOUND NOT TO TELL AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT FOR HE MADE US GIVE HIM OUR WORD ON THE HONOUR OF A GENTLEMAN AND THAT SETTLES IT YOU KNOW
I WISH WE HAD ONE IT'S NICER THAN ANY PETS WE EVER HAD EXCEPT THE PONIES SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENED TO THE DOGS AND THE MONKEY WAS SUCH A NUISANCE AND THE WHITE RABBITS WERE STOLEN AND THE GUINEA PIGS DIED
HAD SO MANY BUNDLES THAT SHE COULD NOT SPARE A HAND TO STRAIGHTEN IT WELL VIRGINIA WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THE BOYS ASKED HER AUNT THEY PROMISED TO MEET US AND CARRY OUR PACKAGES I HEARD THEM IN HERE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO MISS ALLISON
SHE HAD A HORROR OF TRAMPS BUT THE BOYS BEGGED HER TO WAIT UNTIL DAYLIGHT FOR JONESY'S SAKE THE MAN WILL BEAT HIM IF HE FINDS OUT THAT JONESY WARNED US PLEADED KEITH HE WAS SO EARNEST THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS BIG TRUSTFUL EYES
MISS ALLISON FELT SORRY FOR THE LONELY CHILD WHO HAD NEVER BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER FATHER AND MOTHER BEFORE SO SHE DEVOTED HER TIME TO HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TELLING HER STORIES AND ENTERING INTO HER PLAYS AND PLEASURES AS IF THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THE SAME AGE
SEE WHAT AN ENORMOUS VALENTINE PIE AUNT ALLISON HAS MADE LOOKING OVER THE BANISTERS THE BOYS SAW THAT A TABLE HAD BEEN DRAWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WIDE RECEPTION HALL AND ON IT SAT THE LARGEST PIE THAT THEY HAD EVER SEEN
AND IT WILL BE PLENTY WARM FOR A BEAR IF WE TURN ON THE FURNACE A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE HE WAS TYING THE BEAR'S ROPE AROUND A LEG OF THE BIG HIGH POSTED BED WON'T GINGER BE SURPRISED ANSWERED KEITH
CHAPTER FOUR A FIRE AND A PLAN SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT OLD JOHANN HEINRICH NEVER SLEPT FOR NO MATTER WHAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT ONE PASSED HIS LONELY LITTLE HOUSE A LAMP WAS ALWAYS BURNING
THE TRAMP HAD EVIDENTLY WALKED ON THE RAIL SOME DISTANCE IF UNC HENRY HAD GONE QUARTER OF A MILE FARTHER UP THE TRACK HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THOSE SAME SLIDING IMPRINTS
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM OH HE'S A GIRL LAUGHED VIRGINIA LITTLE LLOYD SHERMAN DON'T YOU KNOW SHE LIVES UP AT THE LOCUSTS THAT LOVELY PLACE WITH THE LONG AVENUE OF TREES LEADING UP TO THE HOUSE
JONESY'S NEARLY DONE FOR SAID THE TRAMP POINTING TO THE BOY WHO LAY CURLED UP IN THE HAY COUGHING AT NEARLY EVERY BREATH WE OUGHT TO STAY HERE ANOTHER DAY
I'M AFRAID THE BOSS WILL FIND OUT THAT I'M HERE HE STARTED TO THE STORE FOR SOME TOBACCO AS SOON AS YOU LEFT HE'S BEEN WILD FER SOME BUT DIDN'T HAVE NO MONEY DON'T YOU LEAVE THAT BEAR OUT HERE TO NIGHT IF YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE IT AGAIN
AND THE BEAR OBLIGINGLY WENT THROUGH ALL HIS TRICKS HE WAS USED TO BEING PULLED OUT TO PERFORM WHENEVER A CROWD COULD BE COLLECTED VIRGINIA FORGOT HER FEAR OF HIM WHEN HE STOOD UP AND PRESENTED ARMS LIKE A REAL SOLDIER
AND KNOW ALL THE DEAR OLD NEIGHBOURS THAT I KNEW WOULDN'T MY LITTLE GIRL LIKE THAT OH YES SOME I S'POSE SOBBED VIRGINIA BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I'D HAVE TO BE SO SO EVERLASTINGLY CIVILISED SHE WAILED
AND WHEN MISS ALLISON SAW IT SHE DREW VIRGINIA'S TREMBLING HAND INTO HERS WITH A SYMPATHETIC CLASP BEFORE SHE COULD ASK ANY QUESTIONS THE BOYS BEGAN AN EXCITED EXPLANATION IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY COULD MAKE THEIR STORY UNDERSTOOD
THEY WERE LEADING THE BEAR BETWEEN THEM WE'LL PUT HIM AWAY BACK IN THE HAY MOW WHERE HE'LL BE WARM AND COMFORTABLE TO NIGHT WHISPERED MALCOLM THEN IN THE MORNING WE CAN TELL EVERYBODY WHILE THEY WERE BUSILY SCOOPING OUT A BIG HOLLOW IN THE HAY
AND THAT HE WOULD SIT UP ALL NIGHT TO APPLY THEM HE COULD NOT SLEEP ANYHOW HE SAID AFTER SUCH GREAT EXCITEMENT BUT I FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM URGED MISS ALLISON
AND LOOKED AROUND WONDERINGLY IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS ABLE TO TELL WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE FIRE IT WAS NOT MUCH ONLY A HORRIBLE RECOLLECTION OF BEING AWAKENED BY A FEELING THAT HE WAS CHOKING IN THE THICK SMOKE THAT FILLED THE ROOM
DON'T YOU WISH YOU KNEW VIRGINIA SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS IF SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN THE MATTER AND HELD OUT TWO PACKAGES
SO BRUIN WAS ALLOWED TO GO BACK TO HIS RUG IN THE BLUE ROOM AND THE DOOR WAS SECURELY LOCKED KEITH TOOK LLOYD DOWN TO DINNER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER HEARD HIM APOLOGISING ALL THE WAY DOWN FOR HAVING FRIGHTENED HER THE LITTLE QUEEN OF HEARTS LISTENED SMILINGLY
OF HEARING THE BOSS SWEAR AT HIM TO BE QUICK AND FOLLOW HIM OR HE WOULD BE BURNED TO DEATH THEN THERE HAD BEEN AN AWFUL MOMENT OF GROPING THROUGH THE BLINDING CHOKING SMOKE TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT THE MAN SPRANG TO A WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE
THE NEGRO SERVANTS SEEMED SO QUEER AND FUNNY TO HER THAT SHE FOUND THEM A GREAT SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT AND HER AUNT ALLISON PLANNED SO MANY PLEASANT OCCUPATIONS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS THAT SHE SCARCELY HAD TIME TO GET LONESOME BUT SHE HAD A SHUT IN FEELING
VIRGINIA CAME FLYING DOWN THE STEPS WHITE AS A LITTLE GHOST
ALTHOUGH IT WAS VIRGINIA DUDLEY'S AMBITION TO BE EXACTLY LIKE HER AUNT ALLISON SHE WANTED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER AND GROWN UP

YET SHE KNEW HER TOO WELL TO ASK HER TO GO BACK TO THE HOUSE WITH HER SEVERAL TIMES SHE STARTED UP AND THEN SANK BACK BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE UP HER MIND FINALLY SHE WALKED OVER TO A FENCE CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BONFIRE WHERE THE WATER BUCKET STOOD THE PONIES WERE HITCHED BELOW IN THE RAVINE
SIDE BY SIDE IN A MAIL BAG ON THEIR WAY TO LOUISVILLE
THE HANDS THAT HAD HELD THEM FIRST HAD YEARS BEFORE GROWN TIRED AND WRINKLED AND OLD AND HAD BEEN LYING FOR A GENERATION UNDER THE MYRTLE AND LILIES OF THE CHURCHYARD OUTSIDE
AND TWO VOLUMES OF FAIRY TALES IN GREEN AND GOLD WITH A GORGEOUS PEACOCK ON THE COVER EUGENE FIELD'S POEMS HAD COME IN THE LAST BOX WITH RILEY'S SONGS OF CHILDHOOD AND KIPLING'S JUNGLE TALES TWELVE BEAUTIFUL BOOKS
EVERYBODY IN LLOYDSBORO VALLEY KNEW LOCUST IT IS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST PLACES IN ALL KENTUCKY THEY WERE FOND OF SAYING AND EVERY VISITOR TO THE VALLEY WAS TAKEN PAST THE GREAT ENTRANCE GATE
THE LITTLE DOG EARED BOOKS IN THE MEETING HOUSE PROVED POOR READING SOMETIMES AFTER SUCH ENTERTAINMENT SO MANY OF THEM WERE ABOUT UNNATURALLY GOOD CHILDREN WHO NEVER DID WRONG AND UNNATURALLY BAD CHILDREN WHO NEVER DID RIGHT
ONE FLEW EAST AND ONE FLEW WEST SO I S'POSE THIS WILL FLY INTO THE CUCKOO'S NEST SAID ROB AS HE READ THE ADDRESS MISS ELIZABETH LLOYD LEWIS JAYNES'S POST OFFICE KENTUCKY
MISSUS SHERMAN SAT BESIDE HER SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW THE AMUSED GLANCES THE CHILDREN EXCHANGED BEHIND THE SCREEN WHENEVER HER PROPHECIES CONTRADICTED WHAT THE OLD GYPSY HAD TOLD THEM I CAN JUDGE OF YOUR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS BY YOUR HANDS SHE SAID
ALL OF MISSUS SHERMAN'S GIVING AND THEY WERE LIKE TWELVE GREAT WINDOWS TO BETTY OPENING INTO A NEW STRANGE WORLD FAR AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF HER EVERY DAY LIFE
SHE HAD READ THEM OVER AND OVER SO MANY TIMES THAT SHE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NEXT EVEN BEFORE SHE TURNED THE PAGE AND SHE HAD READ THEM TO THE OTHER CHILDREN SO MANY TIMES THAT THEY TOO KNEW THEM ALMOST BY HEART
AND OF SOME OF HIS BOYISH EFFORTS TO RIGHT THE WRONG IN THE BIG WORLD ABOUT HIM
FOR YOUR FUTURE FORTUNES THIS SHE DID IN SUCH A BRIGHT AMUSING WAY THAT SCREAMS OF LAUGHTER WENT UP FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN AND THE HANDS SHE HELD OFTEN SHOOK WITH MERRIMENT NOT HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GYPSY TENT
IT WILL NEVAH DO TO KEEP MISS ALLISON WAITIN
AND MALCOLM AND I WERE KNIGHTS IN ONE OF THEM OH I KNOW INTERRUPTED BETTY EAGERLY I'VE SEEN YOUR PICTURE TAKEN IN THAT COSTUME AND IT IS LOVELY AND THEN AUNT ALLISON EXPLAINED ALL ABOUT KING ARTHUR AND HIS ROUND TABLE AND GAVE US THE MOTTO
AND SLOWLY TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT
BUT I MUST YOU MUST GET TO THE POST OFFICE IN TIME URGED ALONG BY THE SWITCH AND HER TEARFUL PLEADINGS LAD BROKE INTO A RUN AND BROUGHT UP AT THE POST OFFICE JUST AS THE POSTMISTRESS WAS LOCKING THE MAIL BAG
THEN SHE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE NARROW AISLE OF THE LITTLE MEETING HOUSE BETWEEN ITS DOUBLE ROWS OF NARROW STRAIGHT BACKED PEWS AS SHE REACHED THE BENCH LIKE ALTAR EXTENDING IN FRONT OF THE PULPIT SHE SLIPPED TO HER KNEES A MOMENT
LAUGHED ROB TEASINGLY WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE NOW MISSY YOU'RE HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHORTER THAN I AM I'M ELEVEN YEAHS OLD ANYWAY I'D HAVE YOU TO UNDAHSTAND BOBBY MOORE
ONE OF THE WORST CHARACTERS IN THE COUNTY HE HAD JUST SERVED A THIRD TERM IN THE PENITENTIARY AND SHE HAD HEARD MOM BECK SAY
AND THEY'VE WRITTEN TO EACH OTHAH ONCE A MONTH FOR FIFTEEN YEAHS MISSUS WARE IS A WIDOW NOW
THERE'S A TEAR RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF YOUR NOSE IS THERE ASKED BETTY BRUSHING IT AWAY WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND
DAVY'S MIND LIKE HIS LEGS COULD NOT CLIMB AS FAR AS BETTY'S AND SHE USUALLY HAD TO STOP AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY PAGE TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING OFTEN HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PART
THE SUN POURED IN THROUGH THE SHUTTERLESS WINDOWS SO FIERCELY THAT SHE DID NOT STAY LONG ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO PUT ON A CLEAN APRON AND BRUSH HER CURLY HAIR AS SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE LOOKING GLASS
LEAVING THE POOR DESPOILED TRAVELLER LOOKING MOURNFULLY AT HIS EMPTY POCKETS WHICH WERE TURNED WRONG SIDE OUT STEAL WROTE EUGENIA ON HER CARD ALTHOUGH SHE COULD THINK OF NO BOOK BEGINNING WITH THAT NAME THIEVES WROTE ROB AND ANY ONE LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THE GROUP
WITH THE WATER TRICKLING OUT IN A CEASELESS DRIP DRIP ON THE COLD STONES SHE DABBLED HER FINGERS IN THE SPRING FOR A LONG TIME WHEN THE CHURNING WAS DONE WISHING SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO THE SECRETS IT WAS TRYING TO TELL
AND THEN BETTY READ ON TO HERSELF WITH NOTHING TO BREAK THE STILLNESS AROUND HER BUT THE BUZZING OF THE WASPS AS THEY DARTED ANGRILY IN AND OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW ABOVE HER HEAD TO DAY BETTY HAD READ NEARLY AN HOUR
AND SHE WANTED IT OH HOW SHE WANTED IT FOR MISSUS SHERMAN HAD SAID THAT IT WAS A BOOK
AND HE TOOK HIS TIME IN GOING WELL FOR LITTLE BETTY THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WONDERFUL SURPRISE WAS ON ITS WAY TO HER OR SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE FOR THE LETTER TO ARRIVE IT HAD BEEN A TIRESOME DAY FOR THE CHILD
UNTIL ALL AT ONCE SHE SEEMED TO HEAR MISS ALLISON'S VOICE SAYING I LIKE THIS LITTLE HAND IT WILL KEEP A PROMISE TO THE UTMOST
AND DAVY'S EYELIDS WERE BEGINNING TO FLUTTER DROWSILY WHEN THEY HEARD THE SLOW THUD OF A HORSE'S HOOFS IN THE THICK DUST OF THE ROAD BETTY STOPPED READING TO LISTEN
AS HE CAUGHT UP WITH HER AT THE GATE HE DID NOT EVEN ASK WHERE SHE WAS GOING KNOWING THAT HE WOULD FIND OUT IN DUE TIME IF HE ONLY FOLLOWED FAR ENOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW FAR TO DAY
JUST IN ANY KIND OF WAY AND NEVAH MIND A BIT IF THEIR POAH LITTLE YOUNG ONES FALL OUT OF THE NEST THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT ANY KIND OF HOME IS GOOD ENOUGH
AND CAME ALL THE WAY BACK BY YOURSELF JUST TO POST A LETTER WHEN YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE WAY
I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE ANYHOW AND THERE'S BARELY TIME TO STAMP IT AND SLIP IT IN SO SHE ACTED WHILE SHE SPOKE SO THAT WITH THE LAST WORD SHE HAD TURNED THE KEY
BETTY LED THE WAY ACROSS THE ROAD TO A PLAIN LITTLE WOODEN CHURCH SET BACK IN A GROVE OF CEDAR TREES BEHIND THE CHURCH WAS A GRAVEYARD WHERE THEY OFTEN STROLLED ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS THROUGH THE TANGLE OF GRASS AND WEEDS AND MYRTLE VINES
HUMP GRUNTED THE SQUIRE SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO THE PIGEON HOLE MARKED A IF THAT'S WHO IT IS I KNOW ALL ABOUT HER PRECIOUS LITTLE BRINGING UP SHE'LL GET AT THE APPLETONS I CAN TELL YOU THAT
WHEN THE FEAST HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY MISS ALLISON ARRANGED THEM THE ACTORS WERE ALL LITTLE NEGROES THE FUNNIEST BLACKEST LITTLE PICKANINNIES THAT EVER SUNG A SONG OR DANCED A DOUBLE SHUFFLE IT'S SYLVIA GIBBS'S FAMILY EXPLAINED MISS ALLISON TO THE GIRLS
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF THE HIGH CORN AND OUT OF IT LIMPED A BIG BURLY NEGRO HE HAD A GUN ON HIS SHOULDER AND A SAVAGE EYED DOG SKULKED AT HIS HEELS BETTY NEARLY SCREAMED IN HER TERROR AT THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE
AND FINDING HER PONY GONE TOO
HAIR CUT I HAD TO BEG AND BEG BEFO MOTHAH AND PAPA JACK WOULD LET ME HAVE IT DONE BUT IT WAS SO LONG AWAY BELOW MY WAIST
AND AFTER THE DINNER WAS OVER MORE DISHES TO WASH THEN THERE WERE SOME TOWELS TO IRON IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK BEFORE HER WORK WAS ALL DONE AND SHE HAD TIME TO GO UP TO HER LITTLE ROOM IN THE WEST GABLE
THAT WAS NOT TO BE BROKEN IT WILL KEEP ITS PROMISES TO THE UTMOST SHE SAID AND I FEEL THAT IT WILL HAVE TO DO IT NOW JUST BECAUSE SHE SAID SO THAT IS AUNT ALLISON'S WAY ANSWERED KEITH
ALL THESE THOUGHTS WENT ON SWAYING HER FIRST TO ONE DECISION AND THEN ANOTHER SHE HALF ROSE FROM THE RUG WHERE SHE WAS SITTING THEN DROPPED DOWN AGAIN IT SEEMED HARDLY FAIR THAT EUGENIA SHOULD NOT SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY
AND HAD PROMISED TO BE THERE AT FOUR BUT THE HALL CLOCK STRUCK THE HOUR BEFORE THE LAST DRESS WAS BUTTONED AND THE LAST RIBBON TIED
ANSWERED LLOYD LAUGHING AT THE RECOLLECTION
ONE WAS ABOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE THAT THEY GAVE TO THIRTY LITTLE PEASANT CHILDREN AND SO MANY QUEER THINGS HAPPENED BEHIND A GATE THAT THEY CALLED THE GATE OF THE GIANT SCISSAHS BECAUSE THERE WAS A PAIR OF ENORMOUS SCISSAHS HANGING OVAH IT YOU KNOW
HEADS WERE THRUST OUT OF THE WINDOWS AS THE TWO VANISHED UP THE DUSTY PIKE AND AN OLD GRAYBEARD LOAFING IN FRONT OF THE CORNER GROCERY GAVE AN AMUSED CHUCKLE
WITH THE AVENUE OF LOCUSTS STRETCHING BEYOND IT SPRINGING OFF THE PONY WHEN IT STOPPED AT THE STEPS SHE RUSHED INTO THE HALL SNATCHED THE LETTER FROM THE TABLE AND RAN OUT AGAIN ONLY PAUSING FOR A HASTY GLANCE AT THE CLOCK MOM BECK WHO HAD HEARD THE CLATTER OF HOOFS
AND YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER THAT HE EVER OFFENDED YOU MISSUS CLAVERING HAD WRITTEN BOTH TO JULIA AND TO HARRY AND THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL HAD BEEN SETTLED HARRY HAD ALREADY COMMUNICATED HIS INTENTION OF COMING DOWN AND LADY ONGAR
AND THERE WERE NO TRACES OF TEARS THEN ON HER FACE THOUGH SHE HAD WEPT PLENTIFULLY WHEN MISSUS CLAVERING HAD BEEN WITH HER IN THE MORNING
HE WAS ALWAYS POOR AND SICKLY THE CLAVERINGS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN SO STRONG LOOK AT MYSELF AND ARCHIE AND MY SISTERS WELL IT CANNOT BE HELPED THINKING OF IT WILL NOT BRING HIM BACK AGAIN YOU HAD BETTER TELL SOME ONE TO GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
THUS WRITING IN HIS MIND THAT LETTER TO FLORENCE WHICH HE KNEW IF HE WERE AN HONEST MAN HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIMSELF TO WRITE HE REACHED LADY ONGAR'S DOOR WITHOUT HAVING ARRANGED FOR HIMSELF ANY SPECIAL LINE OF CONDUCT
AND SAID SOMETHING AS TO A PRIVATE LITTLE DINNER FOR TWO THEREBY APOLOGIZING FOR PROPOSING TO THE COUNT TO DINE WITHOUT OTHER GUESTS PATEROFF ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND HARRY NEVER HAVING DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE ORDERED HIS DINNER WITH MUCH NERVOUSNESS
AND DRANK A DROP OF WINE AND ALLOWED THE OLD WOMAN TO TAKE HER AWAY TO THE BED THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HER OF HER HUSBAND SHE SAW NO MORE FOR FOUR DAYS ON THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE WAS BROUGHT TO HER IN WHICH SIR HUGH TOLD HER
WHY HERE HE SAID ALMOST ANGRILY AS HE ENTERED I HAVE HAD HIM HERE WITH ME SINCE YOU WENT HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE NOW HE SAID SHUDDERING I WISH HE HAD BEEN MOVED BEFORE I CAME
BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT MIGHT I HOPE SHE VENTURED FOR AN INSTANT TO GLANCE AT HIS FACE AND SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE GLISTENING WITH A WONDERFUL BRIGHTNESS HOW CAN I ANSWER YOU FURTHER
OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW WHAT WILL BE BEST FOR YOURSELF SHE SAID YES I KNOW NOW WHAT I MUST DO IF SUCH IS TO BE YOUR ANSWER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AS TO THAT I CANNOT REMAIN AT CLAVERING
I DO NOT THINK I CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WELL I LOVE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I CAN NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE SAME FEELING FOR ANY PLACE THAT I HAVE FOR THIS THERE IS NOT A HOUSE A FIELD A GREEN LANE THAT IS NOT DEAR TO ME
AND HAD RETURNED TO ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS LESS PERFECT THAN SHE BUT WHO IN OLD DAYS AS SHE WELL KNEW HAD BEEN HIS FIRST LOVE YES HE WOULD SAY ALL THIS AND JULIA
WHOSE SHORT SUFFERINGS HAD THUS BEEN BROUGHT TO AN END MY POOR DEAR WHAT CAN I SAY TO COMFORT YOU MISSUS CLAVERING AS SHE ASKED THIS KNEW WELL THAT NO COMFORT COULD BE SPOKEN IN WORDS BUT IF SHE COULD ONLY MAKE THE SUFFERER WEEP
HE WAS CALM AND REASONABLE AND TRANQUIL AND TALKED OF HIS GOING AWAY FROM HER AS HE MIGHT HAVE TALKED HAD SOME CHANGE OF AIR BEEN DECLARED NECESSARY FOR HIS HEALTH SHE FELT THAT THIS WAS SO AND WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HIM
TO THE VERY UTMOST WANTING TO GET OUT OF IT MORE THAN IT COULD BE MADE TO GIVE HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE IN DEBT OR INDULGE HIMSELF WITH PRESENT PLEASURES TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE FUNDS OF FUTURE YEARS
SOPHIE HAD BEEN SIMPLY PAID BY HER BROTHER FOR GIVING SUCH INFORMATION AS ENABLED HIM TO ARRANGE THIS MEETING SHE HAD NOT EVEN COUNSELLED HIM TO FOLLOW LADY ONGAR BUT NOW LADY ONGAR IN BLIND WRATH
SHE PUT BACK WITH CAREFUL HANDS THE PIECE OF CAMBRIC WHICH SHE HAD MOVED AND THEN SEATING HERSELF ON A CHAIR WEPT VIOLENTLY WITH HER HANDS CLOSED UPON HER FACE
AND THE POSITION ALSO OF THE DIVINE JULIA SOPHIE HINTED HER FEAR OF ANOTHER CLAVERING LOVER WHAT DID ARCHIE THINK OF HIS COUSIN HARRY WHY HE'S ENGAGED TO ANOTHER GIRL SAID ARCHIE
HE WENT TO HER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ON HIS RETURN TO LONDON IT WILL BE REMEMBERED
YES BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE
LOOKING AT HIM AND IT SEEMED THAT HER EYES WERE IMPLORING HIM TO BE TRUE TO HER IN SPITE OF THE WORDS THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN AND I WILL BE TRUE TO HER HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE WAS THE FIRST THAT I EVER LOVED AND I WILL BE TRUE TO HER
THAT WAS ONGAR'S FAULT ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS NO ONE KNEW IT BETTER THAN HUGH CLAVERING BUT SAID HARRY AND THEN HE STOPPED HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WISHED TO LEARN FROM THE MAN THOUGH HE CERTAINLY DID WISH TO LEARN SOMETHING
THAT COMES OF BRINGING ME HERE HE SAID GET UP HERMIONE I WILL NOT HAVE YOU SO FOOLISH GET UP I SAY I WILL HAVE THE ROOM CLOSED TILL THE MEN COME OH NO GET UP I SAY AND COME AWAY
YOU WILL TAKE NO MORE WINE NO MORE WINE I TAKE MY WINE AT DINNER AS YOU SAW I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE SPECIAL QUESTION ABOUT LADY ONGAR
HE WAS A FAIR MAN WITH A BROAD FAIR FACE AND VERY LIGHT BLUE EYES HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOW BUT BROAD HE WORE NO WHISKERS BUT BORE ON HIS LIP A HEAVY MOUSTACHE WHICH WAS NOT GRAY BUT PERFECTLY WHITE WHITE IT WAS WITH YEARS OF COURSE
NOW THAT YOU ARE FREE AGAIN I CANNOT MARRY MISS BURTON YOU MUST MARRY HER HARRY THERE SHALL BE NO MUST
ALTHOUGH HE HAD SPOKEN OF IT AND HAD EXPECTED IT THE DEATH OF HIS HEIR HIT HIM HARD AS THE RECTOR HAD SAID WHEN DID HE DIE ASKED THE FATHER IT WAS PAST FOUR I THINK THEN THERE WAS AGAIN SILENCE
AND HIS SPEECH HARDLY BETRAYED THAT HE WAS NOT ENGLISH HARRY KNOWING THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER NOTICED NOW AND AGAIN SOME LITTLE ACQUIRED DISTINCTNESS OF SPEECH WHICH IS HARDLY NATURAL TO A NATIVE BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS TONGUE TO BETRAY HIM
MISSUS CLAVERING WENT ACROSS THE PARK ALONE AND SOON FOUND HERSELF IN THE POOR BEREAVED MOTHER'S ROOM SHE WAS SITTING BY HERSELF HAVING DRIVEN THE OLD HOUSE KEEPER AWAY FROM HER
HE WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD DECLINED THE VISIT HER COMING MIGHT BE VERY WELL IF SHE ACCEPTED ARCHIE BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TROUBLED WITH ANY RENEWAL OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY RESPECTING HER IF AS WAS MORE PROBABLE SHE SHOULD REJECT HIM
HE WILL FEEL THIS SAID THE RECTOR FEEL IT PAPA OF COURSE HE WILL FEEL IT
BUT SHE WOULD NOT SAY THE WORDS SHE WAS LESS SELFISH THAN HE AND WAS THINKING WAS TRYING TO THINK WHAT MIGHT BE BEST FOR THEM ALL BUT ABOVE ALL WHAT MIGHT BE BEST FOR HIM SPEAK TO ME HE SAID AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WRONGED ME
THAT THE COUNT HAD HEARD OF HER JOURNEY TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND WORSE THAN THAT SOPHIE MUST AS SHE THOUGHT HAVE INSTIGATED THIS PURSUIT
SHE HAS ONLY BEEN A WIDOW YOU KNOW FOUR MONTHS SAID ARCHIE PLEADING FOR DELAY IT WON'T BE DELICATE WILL IT DELICATE SAID SIR HUGH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS MUCH OF DELICACY IN IT AT ALL
FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD TAKE LODGINGS HE HAD NO IDEA OF GIVING UP LONDON IN THE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER BUT WHY KEEP UP A HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE AS LADY CLAVERING DID NOT USE IT
HOW WAS HE TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH HER THAT LETTER FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN PREPARING THE WORDS AS HE WENT TO BOLTON STREET BEFORE THE NECESSITY FOR IT HAD BECOME IRREVOCABLE DID NOT NOW APPEAR TO HIM TO BE VERY EASY
AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I HAD NOT EVEN IF I HAD PATEROFF WAS SPEAKING OF LADY ONGAR IN THIS WAY AND HARRY HATED HIM FOR DOING SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANY GOOD OF HER SAID HE OR ANY EVIL I CERTAINLY SHALL SAY NO EVIL OF HER
WHAT SHOULD SHE NOW DO AND HOW SHOULD SHE CARRY HERSELF
ANOTHER MESSENGER CAME ACROSS TO SAY THAT HOPE WAS PAST AND THAT THE CHILD HAD GONE COULD MISSUS CLAVERING COME OVER AGAIN AS LADY CLAVERING WAS IN A SAD WAY
KNEW HER TO BE IN MANY THINGS WEAK TO BE WORLDLY LISTLESS AND PERHAPS SOMEWHAT SELFISH BUT SHE KNEW ALSO THAT SHE HAD LOVED HER CHILD AS MOTHERS ALWAYS LOVE
ARCHIE IN SAYING THIS INTENDED TO PUT ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR HE WAS AS SINCERE AS HE KNEW HOW TO BE COME ARCHIE NONE OF THAT SAID HIS BROTHER IT IS MY UNCLE'S TRADE HUGH SAID THE RECTOR
I SOLD MYSELF AS A BEAST IS SOLD AND MEN HAVE TREATED ME AS I TREATED MYSELF HAVE I TREATED YOU SO YES HARRY YOU YOU HOW DID YOU TREAT ME WHEN YOU TOOK ME IN YOUR ARMS AND KISSED ME
BUT THE FIRST WORD SHE HEARD WAS IN HER HUSBAND'S TONES WHERE IS LADY CLAVERING THEN THE ANSWER WAS GIVEN AND THE WIFE KNOWING THAT HE WAS COMING RETREATED TO HER CHAIR BUT STILL HE DID NOT COME QUITE AT ONCE
I WILL COME ACROSS THIS EVENING
HE PROCEEDED TO FORTIFY RAMAH A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM
HE WAS A NATIONAL RATHER THAN A CITY GOD
IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
TWO NAMES WHICH HAVE EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING ETYMOLOGICALLY CONNECTED JAH'S NAME IS ONE OF THE WORDS FOR GOD
THE GOD OF THE DEEP WAS ALSO LORD OF LIFE ENTI KING OF THE RIVER LUGAL IDA AND GOD OF CREATION NUDIMMUD
SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
FORCING THEIR WAY WITH BANEFUL WINDSTORMS MIGHTY DESTROYERS THE DELUGE OF THE STORM GOD
THE PHILISTINES CAME FROM CRETE AND IF THEIR DAGON WAS IMPORTED FROM THAT ISLAND HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH POSEIDON WHOSE WORSHIP EXTENDED THROUGHOUT GREECE THIS GOD OF THE SEA WHO IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE ROMAN NEPTUNE
TWO HUNDRED HORSEMEN AND ONE HUNDRED CHARIOTS SHAMSHI ADAD CONDUCTED IN ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS IN BABYLONIA AND CHALDAEA WHICH HE COMPLETELY SUBDUED PENETRATING AS FAR AS THE SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF
RATHER THAN DAGON WITH JAH
IF ERIDU WAS NOT THE CRADLE OF THE SUMERIAN RACE IT WAS POSSIBLY THE CRADLE OF SUMERIAN CIVILIZATION
THE UNFAITHFUL GOVERNOR BEING FLAYED THE CITY OF DAMDAMUSA WAS SET ON FIRE THEN TELA WAS ATTACKED ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS RUNS AS FOLLOWS
HE WEPT FERTILIZING TEARS AND CORN WAS SOWN AND REAPED AMIDST LAMENTATIONS HE MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH REMI WHO WAS A PHASE OF SEBEK THE CROCODILE GOD A DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE OF NU
WHAT IS GENERALLY CALLED THE DAWN OF HISTORY IS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF A LATER AGE OF PROGRESS IT IS NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEGREE OF CIVILIZATION ATTAINED AT THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF WHICH WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE BY POSTULATING
ANOTHER BABYLONIAN DEITY NAMED DAGAN
AND THE THEORY OBTAINED FOR A TIME
SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
THE GODS OF THE OLDEST COMPANY IN EGYPT WERE THE WRITER BELIEVES INVENTED BY PEOPLE IN WHOSE HOUSEHOLDS WOMEN HELD A HIGH POSITION
THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ASSYRIA WAS CONTINUALLY MENACED BY GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT HILL STATES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE HAD THEY OPERATED TOGETHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY BUT WERE LIABLE TO BE EXTINGUISHED WHEN ATTACKED IN DETAIL
IN EACH DISTRICT THE CHARACTER OF THE DEITY WAS SHAPED TO ACCORD WITH LOCAL CONDITIONS
ALL HIS BODY WAS COVERED WITH HAIR HIS LOCKS WERE LIKE A WOMAN'S THICK AS CORN GREW HIS ABUNDANT HAIR HE WAS A STRANGER TO THE PEOPLE AND IN THAT LAND CLAD IN A GARMENT LIKE GIRA THE GOD HE HAD EATEN GRASS WITH THE GAZELLES HE HAD DRUNK WATER WITH SAVAGE BEASTS
AND THE ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY THE ETHNIC DISTURBANCES WHICH OCCURRED AT VARIOUS WELL DEFINED PERIODS IN THE TIGRO EUPHRATES VALLEY
IN THE ASHMOLEAN MUSEUM OXFORD BEARING AN INSCRIPTION WHICH HE READS AS BAAL DAGON NEAR THE NAME IS AN EAR OF CORN AND OTHER SYMBOLS SUCH AS THE WINGED SOLAR DISC A GAZELLE AND SEVERAL STARS BUT THERE IS NO FISH
AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
TO REVIVE THE SICK MAN
PTAH MOULDED THE FIRST MAN ON HIS POTTER'S WHEEL HE ALSO MOULDED THE SUN AND MOON HE SHAPED THE UNIVERSE AND HAMMERED OUT THE COPPER SKY
AND HE BECAME IDENTIFIED WITH GODS AND GIANTS AND KNIGHT ERRANTS OLD IN STORY
HE RESEMBLED THE INDIAN VISHNU THE PRESERVER WHILE BEL ENLIL RESEMBLED SHIVA THE DESTROYER AND ANU THE FATHER SUPREME BRAHMA THE CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN EXACT ADJUSTMENT BEING DUE PERHAPS TO SUMERIAN POLITICAL CONDITIONS
REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THAT THE GROWTH OF RELIGIOUS MYTHS WAS NOT SO SPONTANEOUS IN EARLY CIVILIZATIONS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AS HAS HITHERTO BEEN ASSUMED IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT IN EACH GREAT LOCAL MYTHOLOGY
TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PERIODIC AND WIDESPREAD MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES WHO HAD ACQUIRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
THE EUPHRATES INDEED WAS HAILED AS A CREATOR OF ALL THAT GREW ON ITS BANKS O THOU RIVER WHO DIDST CREATE ALL THINGS WHEN THE GREAT GODS DUG THEE OUT THEY SET PROSPERITY UPON THY BANKS
BUT EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT SOURCE
A REMOTE RACIAL CONNECTION IS POSSIBLE AND IS CERTAINLY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION WHEN SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS PROFESSOR FRAZER AUTHOR OF THE GOLDEN BOUGH
TO WORK METALS TO MAKE POTTERY AND BRICKS AND TO BUILD TEMPLES HE WAS THE ARTISAN GOD NUN URA GOD OF THE POTTER KUSKI BANDA
IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
ASSOCIATED WITH BEL ENLIL WAS BELTIS LATER KNOWN AS BELTU THE LADY SHE APPEARS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE OTHER GREAT GODDESSES ISHTAR NANA
AND THE THIRD ANSHAR AND KISHAR
TO FLIES HAD TURNED AND BUZZED IN THE STREETS THE WINGED BULLS OF WALLED ROUND ERECH WERE TURNED TO MICE AND DEPARTED THROUGH THE HOLES
THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING
GOD OF THE SAILOR MAY HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND OTHER EARLY CIVILIZATIONS LIKE THE EARLY EGYPTIANS
THE PRIESTLY MAGICIANS OF HISTORIC BABYLONIA
WHICH JUSTIFY THE APPLICATION OF THE TERM INDIGENOUS IN THE BROAD SENSE IT IS FOUND LIKE THAT OF EGYPT TO BE POSSESSED OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH SUGGEST EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE INFLUENCES AND CONNECTIONS AT PRESENT OBSCURE
AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
LIKE THE FRONTIER TRIBES OF INDIA AGAINST THE BRITISH TROOPS THE KINGDOM OF URARTU WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL

THE ESPIONAGE AND SEDITION ACTS BY THE ESPIONAGE LAW OF JUNE FIFTEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AND THE AMENDING LAW KNOWN AS THE SEDITION ACT PASSED IN MAY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE GOVERNMENT WAS GIVEN A DRASTIC POWER OVER THE EXPRESSION OF OPINION
THIS SENTIMENT MISTER HUGHES ECHOED IN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY SOME IT WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN A FIRMER POLICY IN DEALING WITH GREAT BRITAIN BY OTHERS A MORE VIGOROUS HANDLING OF THE SUBMARINE MENACE THE DEMOCRATS ON THEIR SIDE
IT WAS CLEAR THAT GERMANY INTENDED TO EMPLOY SUBMARINES TO DESTROY SHIPPING A NEW FACTOR WAS THUS INTRODUCED INTO NAVAL WARFARE ONE NOT PROVIDED FOR IN THE ACCEPTED LAWS OF WAR
IN THE FACE OF THE CLAMOR FOR EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY WITH ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE CONTENDING POWERS OF EUROPE THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE A MIDDLE COURSE DECLARING THAT THEY WOULD UPHOLD ALL AMERICAN RIGHTS AT HOME AND ABROAD BY LAND AND BY SEA
THE ANGLICAN FAITH AND WORSHIP WERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW SUSTAINED BY TAXES IMPOSED ON ALL AND FAVORED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILORS AND THE RICHEST PLANTERS THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SAYS LODGE WAS ONE OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VIRGINIA ARISTOCRACY
A NEW DOCUMENT ISSUED SEVEN YEARS LATER WRESTED FROM THE PURITANS OF THE COLONY THE RIGHT TO ELECT THEIR OWN GOVERNOR AND RESERVED THE POWER OF APPOINTMENT TO THE KING IT ALSO ABOLISHED THE RULE LIMITING THE SUFFRAGE TO CHURCH MEMBERS

THE FIRST MEASURE PENALIZED THOSE WHO CONVEYED INFORMATION TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO BE USED TO THE INJURY OF THE UNITED STATES THOSE WHO MADE FALSE STATEMENTS DESIGNED TO INTERFERE WITH THE MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES
TOO SMALL IN POPULATION AND TOO SLIGHT IN STRENGTH TO BE MUCH OF A MENACE TO BOSTON HARTFORD OR NEW YORK IT WAS THE STATESMEN IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND RATHER THAN THE COLONISTS IN AMERICA WHO FIRST GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SLOWLY CONVERGING EMPIRES IN NORTH AMERICA
AND THE SOCIALISTS SUFFERED A SEVERE SET BACK FALLING FAR BEHIND THE VOTE OF NINETEEN TWELVE PRESIDENT WILSON URGES PEACE UPON THE WARRING NATIONS APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT HIS PACIFIC POLICIES HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY APPROVED BY HIS COUNTRYMEN
AGAINST THE PROTESTS OF THE CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKEWISE ESTABLISHED IN MARYLAND IN NEW YORK TOO NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESISTANCE OF THE DUTCH THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WAS FOSTERED BY THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS
THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMED FOR THE PERIOD OF THE WAR THE OPERATION OF THE RAILWAYS UNDER A PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION WHICH WAS ELABORATED IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN BY ACT OF CONGRESS
A WARSHIP OVERHAULING A MERCHANT VESSEL COULD EASILY TAKE ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS ON BOARD FOR SAFE KEEPING AS PRESCRIBED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT A SUBMARINE ORDINARILY COULD DO NOTHING OF THE SORT OF NECESSITY THE LIVES AND THE SHIPS OF NEUTRALS AS WELL AS OF BELLIGERENTS
A FREE CITIZEN OF PENNSYLVANIA WHO INDULGED IN HORSE RACING AND GAMBLING WAS LET OFF WITH A FINE A WHITE SERVANT GUILTY OF THE SAME UNLAWFUL CONDUCT WAS WHIPPED AT THE POST AND FINED AS WELL
THE PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS HAD CAST OFF ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AND ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONGREGATION BEFORE THEY CAME TO AMERICA
TO THREE MILLION SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF WHOM MORE THAN TWO MILLION WERE IN FRANCE WHEN THE ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED ALTHOUGH AMERICAN TROOPS DID NOT TAKE PART ON A LARGE SCALE UNTIL THE LAST PHASE OF THE WAR IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
IN THE PROPRIETARY COLONIES THE PROPORTION OF BOND SERVANTS WAS VERY HIGH THE BALTIMORES PENNS CARTERETS AND OTHER PROMOTERS ANXIOUSLY SOUGHT FOR WORKERS OF EVERY NATIONALITY TO TILL THEIR FIELDS FOR LAND WITHOUT LABOR WAS WORTH NO MORE THAN LAND IN THE MOON
UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER COULD DO SO FOR WE CAN TRACE THE FAMILY FORTUNES OF MANY EARLY SETTLERS HENRY CABOT LODGE IS AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THE SETTLERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE DRAWN
MUST PUT A CURB UPON OUR SENTIMENTS AS WELL AS UPON EVERY TRANSACTION THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS A PREFERENCE OF ONE PARTY TO THE STRUGGLE BEFORE ANOTHER THE CLASH OVER AMERICAN TRADE AS IN THE TIME OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS
A THOUGHTLESS MAID SERVANT WHO FOR SOME EARTHLY REASON SMILED IN CHURCH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BANISHED AS A VAGABOND ROBERT PIKE A DEVOUT PURITAN THINKING THE SUN HAD GONE TO REST VENTURED FORTH ON HORSEBACK ONE SUNDAY EVENING

AND FEWER STILL WHO COULD DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO THINGS THAT DELIGHT THE EYE AND THE MIND AND YET POOR AND MEAGER AS THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COLONISTS MAY SEEM BY WAY OF COMPARISON HEROIC EFFORTS WERE MADE IN EVERY COMMUNITY TO LIFT THE PEOPLE ABOVE THE PLANE
INDEED THEY EXAGGERATED ITS EVILS FOR MANY OF THE CRIMINALS WERE ONLY MILD OFFENDERS AGAINST UNDULY HARSH AND CRUEL LAWS A PEASANT CAUGHT SHOOTING A RABBIT ON A LORD'S ESTATE

INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF SLAVERY THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AFRICANS IN VIRGINIA THE GREAT INCREASE IN LATER YEARS WAS DUE IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO THE INORDINATE ZEAL FOR PROFITS THAT SEIZED SLAVE TRADERS BOTH IN OLD AND IN NEW ENGLAND
THE GERMAN DECREE ADDED THAT AS THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY HAD ORDERED THE USE OF NEUTRAL FLAGS BY ENGLISH SHIPS IN TIME OF DISTRESS NEUTRAL VESSELS WOULD BE IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION IF FOUND IN THE FORBIDDEN AREA
ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE ENGLAND SUBSIDIZED PRUSSIAN ARMS TO HOLD FRANCE AT BAY IN INDIA ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES AS ON THE BANKS OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE BRITISH ARMS WERE TRIUMPHANT WELL COULD THE HISTORIAN WRITE

PRESIDENT WILSON IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE SENATE DECLARED IT TO BE A DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE PART IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STABLE PEACE ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES THESE WERE IN SHORT PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY
AND LIME ROCK GRAY THREW BACK THE RAY ACROSS THE RAPID FLOOD THOUGH COLD EACH FORM THEIR LOVE STILL WARM FROM HEARTH AND LATTICE GLOWS
BUT IN WINTER THE VAST AIRY SPACE HAD A PECULIAR AND SEARCHING CHILL NO BARN COULD BE COLDER EXCEPT THAT THE NUMEROUS FOOTSTOVES MADE SOME LITTLE CHANGE IN THE AIR DURING SERVICE
SUCH A QUESTION AND THAT IS ALL I ELICITED MUSIC AGAIN THE FORENOON OCCUPATION MISS FLORA DOES NOT LIKE BEING CRITICIZED I FIND
THAT I AM WASTED ALMOST TO A SHADOW AND FEARS ARE ENTERTAINED THAT I SHALL WHOLLY VANISH INTO THIN AIR MY PHYSICIAN TALKS GRAVELY ABOUT MY HAVING EXHAUSTED MY NERVOUS ENERGY AND SENDS ME TO RATBOROUGH
AND IF I HAVE SOMETIMES ALLOWED FLORA TO DO IT UNREBUKED YOU WELL KNOW THAT SHE MIGHT ONCE HAVE PULLED MY HAIR OR CUFFED MY EARS AND I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT
I AM TO SUPPOSE THAT YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS WERE NOT AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE OF MISSUS BLACK WHOM I HEARD REMARK THAT I WAS AN AMIABLE YOUTH WITH AN UNCOMMONLY PLEASANT SMILE
FIRST SOUND OF BUSY LIFE AND THE SHRILL NEIGH OF VAPOR STEED THE VALE OF BRIGHTON THREADING
AND IT IS A PIECE OF SELF DENIAL TO CLOSE THE SHUTTER LIGHT MY LAMP AND WRITE IN MY JOURNAL PEACE OF MIND CAME YESTERDAY POSITIVE HAPPINESS TO DAY NEITHER OF WHICH I CAN ANALYZE
THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
A PHAROS TRUE LIGHT EVER NEW STREAMS THROUGH ITS FRIENDLY PANE TO GUIDE AND GREET BENIGHTED FEET WHICH THREAD THE WINDING LANE LOFTY AND LONE
IT WAS A YOUNG MAN WITH HIS CHAIR TIPPED BACK HIS FEET RESTED ON A TABLE WITH A SLIPPER PERCHED ON EACH TOE HIS HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THE FACE
INSTEAD OF ADONIZING I WILL SET MY LONG LOCKS ON END AND DON MY SLIPSHOD SLIPPERS YES AUNT I HEAR GOOD LADY I WILL PRESENTLY ARRIVE TO MAKE MY BOW TO LITTLE HANDSOME
SAID MISS ETTY SHYLY IT IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT I WAS URGING FLORA PLEASE TO LET ME HAVE THE BASKET
I LIKE ESPECIALLY TO RATTLE ON WHEN ANY NONSENSE WILL DO CHAT IS TRULY AGREEABLE WHEN ONE'S BRAINS ARE NOT SEVERELY TAXED TO KEEP IT GOING
TIME SCATTERED ALL THOSE PEARLS THEY FELL UNSTRUNG OLD GRAVES AMONG O'ER ALL THE SNOW WREATH CURLS YET SHINES THAT LIGHT FROM LATTICE BRIGHT
T IS BUT THE EARLIEST THE WARNING PEAL HE SLEEPS AGAIN HAPPY IF BUSTLING CHUM FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE ENTRY OR PERCHANCE IN THE HOME BOWER MATERNAL KNOCK
MARKING THE CADENCE THE UNWEARIED CRICKETS FILL UP THE HARMONY AND THE WHIPPOORWILL HIS MOURNFUL SOLO SINGS AMONG THE WILLOWS THE TREE TOAD'S PLEASANT TRILLING CROAK
NEITHER HAVE I DONE SO CRIED I IN A TOWERING PASSION YOU DO ME A GREAT WRONG IN ACCUSING ME OF IT I WOULD KNOCK ANY MAN DOWN WHO SHOULD TREAT MY AUNT WITH ANY DISRESPECT
AND THE CHILDEN CHIMES IN WITH THEIR PLAINTIVE BOO HOO HOW HOLY THE CALM IN THE STILLNESS OF NEUNE WHEN THE POT
A MAN OF ANY RIGHT FEELING AT ALL COULD NOT MAKE GAME OF AN AGED WOMAN HIS OWN RELATIVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE WAS RECEIVING HER HEARTY AND AFFECTIONATE HOSPITALITY
BY THE WAY WHAT IS HER REAL NAME I WON'T CONDESCEND TO ASK ANY QUESTION ABOUT HER BUT REALLY I WISH I KNEW WHETHER IT IS MEHITABLE
EARNEST TONE THE WEDDING RING STRANGE MYSTIC THING FAST BINDS THE TWAIN IN ONE THE SOLEMN WORD NO LONGER HEARD WITH CHASTENED STEPS AND SLOW
THE TREAD OF CLUMSY FEET ARE HURRYING ON BUT NOW WITH INSTINCT SURE MADLY THOSE DOOMED ONES BOLT FROM THE DREAD ROAD THAT LEADS TO BRIGHTON AND TO DEATH THEY CHARGE
I COME FORWARD AS SHE COMES NEAR ON THAT RAT LIKE PONY OF HERS WHO HOLDS HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LOST IN THE ROAD I STAND IN DOUBT WHETHER TO LAUGH AT HER PREDICAMENT
I HAD NO CLAIM TO ANY FORBEARANCE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR PECULIARITIES OF ANY SORT I AM PERFECTLY RESIGNED TO BEING THE THEME OF YOUR WIT IN ANY CIRCLE
IF YOU CAN FIND AUGHT IN MY COUNTRY BRED WAYS TO AMUSE YOU ZOUNDS I MUST SPEAK MY CONDUCT TO FLORA MUST HAVE CONFIRMED THE CHARMING IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY MY UNLUCKY PHIZ I IMAGINE
THAT STARTLES ONE WAS I NEAR THINKING OF IT IN EARNEST SHE IS BEAUTIFUL I SHOULD BE PROUD OF HER ABROAD BUT AT HOME AT HOME WHERE THERE SHOULD
BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
THIS SUGGESTION BEING VERY SMILINGLY ASSENTED TO HE PROCEEDED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRES AND FOR THAT DAY THE SERVICES WERE NOT INDEBTED TO ARTIFICIAL WARMTH TO PROMOTE THEIR EFFECT
URGED ON BY TWO FIENDISH BOYS AND A SAVAGE DOG WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING ME FROM THE CAMBRIDGE SIDE WHAT SHOULD I DO I WAS TOO MUCH FATIGUED TO RUN AND I HAD NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM MY PLANS WERE HASTILY FORMED
MONOTONOUS THE MELANCHOLY STRAIN SAVE WHEN THE BULL FROG FROM SOME SLIMY DEPTH PROFOUND SENDS UP HIS DEEP POO TOOB POO TOOB LIKE A STACCATO NOTE OF DOUBLE BASS
SHE HAD DISLIKED ME AND PERHAPS DISLIKED ME YET IT WAS NOT THAT I STOOD IN FEAR OF YOUR SATIRE SHE CONTINUED I AM INDIFFERENT TO RIDICULE OR CENSURE IN GENERAL
AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
O'ER ROCK AND WOOD THICK STORM CLOUDS BROOD AND DOUBTS OUR STEPS DELAY NO BEACON LIGHT YET CHEERS THE NIGHT HOW GLOOMY GROWS THE HOUR AH
NO INDEED WE RAN SHIVERING THROUGH THE LONG WINDY ENTRIES ALL WRAPPED IN SHAWLS AND HUGGING OURSELVES TO RETAIN THE FRIENDLY WARMTH OF THE FIRE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FAR FROM DEVISING WAYS OF LETTING IN THE AIR WE TRIED HARD TO KEEP IT OUT
ANON SOME BOUND ALONG DIVERGENT PATHS WHICH SCAR THE GRASSY PLAIN AND WITH NO PAUSE FOR BREATH PRESS UP THE ROCKY STAIR
HIS SCHEMING BRAIN TEEMS WITH BROAD PLANS AND HOPES OF FUTURE WEALTH AND TIME AND LIFE MOVE ALL TOO SLOW FOR HIM WILL HE INDUSTRIOUS GAINS AND HOME RENOUNCE
I COULD STAMP I AM SO IMPATIENT OF DOING NOTHING BUT LOUNGE ABOUT I AM AS SNAPPISH AS A CHAINED CUR AS CROSS AS A CAGED BEAR AND WHILE I GNAW MY NAILS AND STRETCH AND YAWN
THE OBJECT OF IT I IMAGINE THE INDIGNANT BEAUTY BEGINS TO PLOT A DIFFERENT REVENGE ON ME HA HA MISS FLORA IT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU LIKE ME BETTER THAN YOU DID THAT YOU ARE
SHE MADE NO ANSWER BUT LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE WITH ONE OF THOSE WONDROUS SMILES IT WENT AS STRAIGHT TO MY HEART AS A PISTOL BULLET COULD DO MY HIGH INDIGNATION PROVING NO DEFENCE AGAINST IT
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT A CREEPING FEELING OF AWE MINGLED WITH HIS ASTONISHMENT THAT NATHAN GAZED UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THIS SILENT FIGURE HAD VANISHED BUT HE WAS NOT EASILY TO BE DAUNTED
SHE VANISHES SEVERAL HOURS AT A TIME AND I HEAR HER HUMMING TO HERSELF SOMETIMES IN ONE ROOM SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER
AND NUT BROWN ALE HIS PIPE AND ROCKING CHAIR ARE WAITING LONG WHILE THE BRIDAL THRONG STILL LINGERS UNAWARE AN ANCIENT GLOOM FILLS ALL THE ROOM
THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
THAT THE RESCUE PARTY STARED IN AMAZEMENT NEVER HAD THEY SEEN SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF TEMPER WHEN MABEL APPEARED HER SHABBY HAT IN HER HAND
CRIED MARIAN BARBER IT ISN'T THE HATCHET WE CARE FOR IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING GIVE THEM WHAT THEY DESERVE JULIA NEVER FEAR REPLIED JULIA I'LL EFFECTUALLY ATTEND TO THEIR CASE NOW WE'D BETTER DODGE AROUND THE CORNER AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT UNTIL THEY GET HERE
TAKING ONE OF GRACE'S HANDS BETWEEN HERS AND LOOKING AT HER WITH A WORLD OF GRATITUDE IN HER EYES I WILL WRITE TO NIGHT I MUST GO NOW OR I SHALL BE HOME LATE FORGIVE ME FOR HURRYING AWAY BUT I DAREN'T STAY SHE ADDED PITEOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
AS HE SPOKE THE DOOR WAS OPENED BY MABEL WHO POSITIVELY SHOOK IN HER SHOES WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS DON'T BE FRIGHTENED WHISPERED GRACE TAKING HER HAND WE HAVE COME FOR YOU
AND THE SENSATIONAL PLAYING OF NORA AND MIRIAM WAS A MATTER OF WONDER TO THE SPECTATORS WHO CONCEDED IT TO BE THE FASTEST MOST BRILLIANT HALF EVER PLAYED BY AN OAKDALE TEAM
YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
BY THE WAY ANNE SAID GRACE AS YOU ARE A POET YOU MUST COMPOSE A BASKETBALL SONG TO DAY AND I'LL SEE THAT THE JUNIORS ALL HAVE COPIES IT'S TIME WE HAD ONE LET ME SEE WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD TUNE RALLY ROUND THE FLAG SUGGESTED MIRIAM NESBIT THAT HAS A DANDY SWING TO IT
SAID GRACE SEVERELY YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE BETTER EXCUSES THAN FOOTBALL AND EXPERIMENTS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO TO SQUARE OURSELVES SAID DAVID SMILING WE'LL TAKE YOU GIRLS TO THE FOOTBALL GAME NEXT THURSDAY IT'S THANKSGIVING DAY YOU KNOW AND OAKDALE IS GOING TO PLAY GEORGETOWN COLLEGE
SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SHOULD LIKE WELLESLEY I SHALL NOT TRY TO DECIDE WHERE I WANT TO GO FOR A WHILE YET
ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
SLOWLY TOWARD JESSICA'S HOME
WHY OF COURSE ANSWERED GRACE AND ANNE IN THE SAME BREATH WHAT IS IT YOU WANT US TO DO WELL IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF YOUR JUNIORS ARE STILL IN NEED OF DISCIPLINE YOU REMEMBER THE HATCHET THAT WE BURIED LAST YEAR WITH SUCH POMP AND CEREMONY
IT WAS DECIDED AT ONCE THAT THEY COULD GO AND SOON THE FOUR CHUMS WERE WALKING BRISKLY DOWN THE STREET IN THE DIRECTION OF HEARTSEASE
AND THESE TWO SNIPS OF GIRLS WITH YOU ALMOST SCREAMED MISS BRANT THAT WILL DO SAID MISTER BRIGHT STERNLY WE WILL GO BUT WE SHALL TAKE MISS MABEL WITH US
SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO OFTEN WITH MISSUS GRAY OH YOU HAVE THE SUITE AT THE BACK SHE EXCLAIMED I LOVE THOSE TWO ROOMS YOU WILL FIND THEM SOMEWHAT CHANGED
GLAD TO KNOW THAT SAID GRACE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOISES I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH IT THERE WAS ONE NOISE THAT STARTED THAT WAS PROMPTLY HUSHED SAID ANNE YOU HEARD IT TOO DIDN'T YOU JESSICA OH YES GIRLS I INTENDED TELLING YOU BEFORE THIS REPLIED JESSICA
THEY'LL BE VERY MUCH ASTONISHED TO FIND US WAITING AT THE CHURCH'
YOU DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO HAVE YOURSELF APPOINTED HER GUARDIAN YOU AGREED TO PAY HER FOR HER WORK BUT BLOWS AND HARSH WORDS ARE THE ONLY PAYMENT
SHE FELT A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST ELEANOR FOR HER ACCUSATION AGAINST MABEL WHO HAD GROWN VERY DEAR TO HER AND WHOM SHE MOTHERED LIKE A HEN WITH ONE CHICKEN SHE'LL PROBABLY APPEAR AT THE GAME IN ALL HER GLORY SAID MIRIAM NESBIT
WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
ELEANOR OVERTOOK MISS TEBBS JUST OUTSIDE MISS THOMPSON'S OFFICE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MISS TEBBS SAID ELEANOR AS THE TEACHER PAUSED HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MISS SAVELL I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE PLAY
AND AFTER TIGHTENING A STRING ANNOUNCED HERSELF READY THE GIRLS LISTENED SPELLBOUND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ELEANOR'S VERY SOUL HAD ENTERED INTO THE VIOLIN THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE CAPRICIOUS ELEANOR OF HALF AN HOUR BEFORE
ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
HE WILL HELP US GRACE CONCLUDED THEN WHEN YOU ARE FREE WE SHALL HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU JUST BE PATIENT FOR A FEW DAYS AND DON'T BE AFRAID EVERYTHING WILL COME RIGHT HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU ALL SAID MABEL
THOUGHT GRACE AS SHE LISTENED TO THE LAST PLAINTIVE NOTES OF THE CAVATINA I'LL FORGIVE HER FOR HER MUSIC'S SAKE ONE HAS TO MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR PEOPLE LIKE HER IT IS THE CLAIM OF THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT PLEASE PLAY ONCE MORE
THAT I SHALL NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK THERE AGAIN I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S ALL A DREAM AND THAT I'LL WAKE UP AND FIND HER STANDING OVER ME CAN SHE GET ME AGAIN SHE SAID TURNING PITEOUSLY TO MISTER BRIGHT
FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
I REGRET THAT I'M TOO BUSY TO BOW MY THANKS BUT TO GET DOWN TO THE BUSINESS OF THE HOUR TELL ME MABEL DEAR DID THIS MISS BRANT LEGALLY ADOPT YOU WHEN SHE TOOK YOU FROM THE ORPHANAGE
HOWEVER I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER MUCH ABOUT THE PLAY NOW FOR THE SENIOR TEAM HAS JUST SENT ME A CHALLENGE TO PLAY THEM SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SO I'LL HAVE TO GET THE TEAM TOGETHER AND GO TO WORK WE'RE AWFULLY LATE THIS YEAR ABOUT STARTING DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED NORA
SKIPPED SCHOOL TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON IN THE THEATRE BY THE GIRLS THIS FORM OF TRUANCY WAS CONSIDERED A LARK
AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE MY HOUSE WITH ANY OF MY PROPERTY YOU BAGGAGE SHE HISSED
WE SHALL WIN SAID MIRIAM NESBIT CONFIDENTLY I FEEL IT IN MY BONES LET'S HOPE THAT YOUR BONES ARE TRUE PROPHETS LAUGHED MARIAN BARBER O GIRLS EXCLAIMED EVA ALLEN FROM THE OPEN DOOR IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN STANDING LOOKING UP AT THE GALLERY ELEANOR IS HERE
THE RECESS BELL CUT SHORT THE CONVERSATION AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR DESKS WITH FAR BETTER IDEAS OF THE COMING GAME THAN OF THE AFTERNOON'S LESSONS SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH DAWNED COLD AND CLEAR AND THE GIRLS ON BOTH TEAMS WERE IN HIGH SPIRITS AS THEY HUSTLED INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCKER ROOMS
TO MAKE MISCHIEF AND WE ARE HERE TO PREVENT IT AND FURTHERMORE ARE GOING TO DO SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN RETORTED ELEANOR HER EYES FLASHING JUST THIS REPLIED JULIA
WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
SAID GRACE AS THEY LEFT THE GYMNASIUM THAT AFTERNOON
GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
THERE IS TALK OF GIVING A SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY WITH MISS TEBBS TO ENGINEER IT AND THE CAST TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE THREE LOWER CLASSES THE SENIORS OF COURSE WILL GIVE THEIR OWN PLAY LATER HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ASKED ANNE MISS THOMPSON HERSELF TOLD ME ABOUT IT REPLIED GRACE
THE SORORITY THAT ELEANOR HAD MENTIONED IN HER LETTER TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WAS NOW IN FULL FLOWER THE SEVEN GIRLS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE OMNIBUS HOUSE WERE THE CHOSEN MEMBERS THEY WORE PINS IN THE SHAPE OF SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
OR PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM RELIGIOUS AND PARTY ZEAL HE SEEMS NEVER IN THE COURSE OF HIS PUBLIC CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN DIVERTED BY PRIVATE INTEREST OR AMBITION FROM ADHERING STRICTLY TO THESE PRINCIPLES SINCERE IN HIS PROFESSIONS
TO LAY ASIDE ALL PRIVATE ENDS AND RENOUNCE EVERY OFFICE ATTENDED WITH PROFIT OR ADVANTAGE THAT THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY MEMBERS OCCUPIED IN DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS HAD RENDERED THE HOUSE EXTREMELY THIN AND DIMINISHED THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS
THE PEERS THOUGH THE SCHEME WAS IN PART LEVELLED AGAINST THEIR ORDER THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE AT BOTTOM EXTREMELY AVERSE TO IT THOUGH THEY EVEN VENTURED ONCE TO REJECT IT YET POSSESSED SO LITTLE AUTHORITY THAT THEY DURST NOT PERSEVERE IN OPPOSING THE RESOLUTION OF THE COMMONS
AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
AND THE KING'S HONOR LAY RATHER IN SHOWING SOME EARLY SYMPTOMS OF COURAGE AND ACTIVITY THAN IN CHOOSING STRICTLY A PARTY AMONG THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSIES WITH WHICH IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED HE WAS AS YET VERY LITTLE ACQUAINTED THESE ARGUMENTS
WHICH IN THEIR APPREHENSION HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF SO MUCH DISORDER WERE THE ARMS OF THE STATE THEREFORE PUT ENTIRELY INTO SUCH HANDS WHAT PUBLIC SECURITY IT MAY BE DEMANDED CAN BE GIVEN TO LIBERTY
WOULD FIRST BE ATTEMPTED BY CROMWELL AND HE WAS DESIROUS TO EMPLOY THE ENEMY SOME TIME IN THAT SIEGE WHILE HE HIMSELF SHOULD REPAIR HIS BROKEN FORCES BUT CROMWELL KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DESPATCH HAVING MADE A BREACH HE ORDERED A GENERAL ASSAULT
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
AND HIS ADHERENTS AND ADDED THE TERRORS OF SUPERSTITION TO THOSE WHICH AROSE FROM A VICTORIOUS ENEMY CROMWELL HAVING RECEIVED A REENFORCEMENT FROM ENGLAND AGAIN TOOK THE FIELD EARLY IN THE SPRING
EVEN IN A FEAST WHICH THE CITY GAVE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL OF STATE IT WAS DEEMED A REQUISITE PRECAUTION IF WE MAY CREDIT WALKER AND DUGDALE
REQUIRED BY HIS BIRTH AND STATION GAVE WAY TO A NEGLIGENCE WHICH WAS EASILY OBSERVABLE ON THE MORNING OF THE BATTLE IN WHICH HE FELL HE HAD SHOWN SOME CARE OF ADORNING HIS PERSON AND GAVE FOR A REASON
THAT BY SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCES THEY SHOULD BE ENABLED TO CARRY THEIR TRIUMPHANT COVENANT TO THE GATES OF ROME ITSELF IT BEHOVED THEM FIRST TO RENDER IT PREVALENT IN ENGLAND WHICH ALREADY SHOWED SO GREAT A DISPOSITION TO RECEIVE IT
THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
A COVENANT AS A TEST WAS TAKEN BY THE LORDS AND COMMONS AND IMPOSED ON THEIR ARMY AND ON ALL WHO LIVED WITHIN THEIR QUARTERS BESIDES RESOLVING TO AMEND AND REFORM THEIR LIVES
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH A COMMON WEALTH OR
ALL THE OTHER MEASURES OF THE PARLIAMENT EITHER WERE HITHERTO ABSOLUTELY INSIGNIFICANT OR TENDED RATHER TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PROTESTANT CAUSE IN IRELAND BY CONTINUING THEIR VIOLENT PERSECUTION AND STILL MORE VIOLENT MENACES AGAINST PRIESTS AND PAPISTS
HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
STILL MORE EXORBITANT WHICH A LITTLE BEFORE HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THE KING AT OXFORD SUCH IGNOMINIOUS TERMS WERE THERE INSISTED ON THAT WORSE COULD SCARCELY BE DEMANDED WERE CHARLES TOTALLY VANQUISHED A PRISONER AND IN CHAINS
WITH THE MOST PROFOUND DISSIMULATION HE COUNTERFEITED SUCH REMORSE OF CONSCIENCE THAT HIS EXECUTION WAS PUT OFF OUT OF MERE CHRISTIAN COMPASSION TILL HE MIGHT RECOVER THE USE OF HIS UNDERSTANDING HE INVITED VISITS FROM THE RULING CLERGY OF ALL SECTS
MADE HIS RETREAT INTO JERSEY WHERE HIS AUTHORITY WAS STILL ACKNOWLEDGED HERE WINRAM LAIRD OF LIBERTON
THE CITY BEAT A PARLEY THE GARRISON WAS ALLOWED TO MARCH OUT WITH THEIR ARMS AND BAGGAGE
THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
AND HE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON AS A PROMOTER OF SEDITION AND DISORDER IN THE COMMONWEALTH THE WOMEN APPLIED BY PETITION FOR HIS RELEASE BUT WERE NOW DESIRED TO MIND THEIR HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AND LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE TO THE MEN
BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
AS IF THEIR BUSINESS WERE CHIEFLY BY PROVOKING THE KING TO MAKE HIM VIOLATE HIS OWN SAFE CONDUCT THE ANSWER FROM THE CITY WAS IN THESE WORDS WE THE INHABITANTS MAGISTRATES OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WITHIN THE GARRISON OF GLOUCESTER
NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
WHICH MIGHT OBLIGE THE PARLIAMENT TO ACCEPT OF REASONABLE CONDITIONS AND RESTORE PEACE TO THE NATION THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION JOINED TO HIS CHARACTER OF COURAGE AND INTEGRITY HAD PROCURED HIM THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF NORTHUMBERLAND CONWAY
NEWCASTLE'S REGIMENT ALONE RESOLUTE TO CONQUER OR TO PERISH OBSTINATELY KEPT THEIR GROUND AND MAINTAINED BY THEIR DEAD BODIES THE SAME ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD AT FIRST BEEN RANGED IN THE OTHER WING SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX
SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
WROTE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND DESIRED LEAVE TO RETAIN FOR SOME DAYS LIEUTENANT GENERAL CROMWELL WHOSE ADVICE HE SAID WOULD BE USEFUL IN SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAD RESIGNED SHORTLY AFTER HE BEGGED WITH MUCH EARNESTNESS
AND DISTRIBUTED HIS FORCES INTO PLYMOUTH AND EXETER NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ADVANTAGES THE EXTREME WANT BOTH OF MONEY AND AMMUNITION UNDER WHICH THE CORNISH ROYALISTS LABORED
HIS GARRISON HOWEVER WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY AND HE FAILED NOT FROM TIME TO TIME TO INFORM THE PARLIAMENT THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RELIEVED HE SHOULD BE NECESSITATED FROM THE EXTREME WANT OF PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION TO OPEN HIS GATES TO THE ENEMY
AND DO ACCORDINGLY CONCEIVE OURSELVES WHOLLY BOUND TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND ARE RESOLVED BY GOD'S HELP TO KEEP THIS CITY ACCORDINGLY
ON ACCOUNT OF ITS GREAT SUPERIORITY IN CAVALRY AND HE RESOLVED TO RETURN IF POSSIBLE WITHOUT RUNNING THAT HAZARD HE LAY FIVE DAYS AT TEWKESBURY WHICH WAS HIS FIRST STAGE AFTER LEAVING GLOUCESTER AND HE FEIGNED BY SOME PREPARATIONS
A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WHO BEFORE HE ENGAGED WITH THE PARLIAMENT HAD OFFERED HIS SERVICE TO THE KING AND AS HE WAS FREE FROM THE FUMES OF ENTHUSIASM BY WHICH MOST OF THE OFFICERS ON THAT SIDE WERE INTOXICATED HE WOULD LEND AN EAR IT WAS PRESUMED
HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
AND BY USING WELL THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD ATTAINED BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE HE HAS LESSENED IF NOT OVERPOWERED OUR DETESTATION OF HIS ENORMITIES BY OUR ADMIRATION OF HIS SUCCESS AND OF HIS GENIUS
THIS MAN DEVOTED TO THE PURSUITS OF LEARNING AND TO THE SOCIETY OF ALL THE POLITE AND ELEGANT HAD ENJOYED HIMSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE WHICH A FINE GENIUS A GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND AN OPULENT FORTUNE COULD AFFORD CALLED INTO PUBLIC LIFE
LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
AND THIS NEUTRALITY HELD ALL THE WINTER SEASON IN THE SPRING IT WAS BROKEN BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES BUT WAR RECOMMENCED WITH GREAT APPEARANCE OF DISADVANTAGE TO THE KING'S PARTY STAMFORD
HENRIETTA HAD SCARCELY SEEN BEFORE ITS SPLENDID TREASURES OF ART LORD MONTFORT IN ANSWER TO HER CURIOSITY HAD ALWAYS PLAYFULLY DEPRECIATED THEM AND SAID THAT THEY MUST BE LEFT FOR RAINY DAYS
BUT SHE HAS GOT TWO NAMES WHY DON'T YOU SAY BOTH NAMES MY DEAR CONTINUED LADY BELLAIR ADDRESSING HER TRAVELLING COMPANION I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME TELL ALL THESE GOOD PEOPLE YOUR NAME YOUR TWO NAMES I LIKE PEOPLE WITH TWO NAMES
VERY MUCH INTERESTED THE CURIOSITY OF HIS FELLOW SERVANTS BY HIS INTIMATIONS OF HER LADYSHIP'S ECCENTRICITIES YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PARROT MARY SAID THE BUTLER AND YOU SUSAN MUST LOOK AFTER THE PAGE
YOU ARE MISTAKEN WHEN I CAST MY LOT AT ARMINE I SANK A PORTION OF MY CAPITAL ON MY LIFE SO SLENDER ARE MY WANTS HERE AND SO LITTLE DOES YOUR DEAR LADY PERMIT ME TO DESIRE THAT BELIEVE ME
OF VEXATIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE HAD BEEN SO NEAR PERFECT HAPPINESS
FROM WHICH NONE ARE FREE WHICH IS A FERTILE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND WHICH WOULD AT ALL TIMES
LORD MONTFORT WILL THANK ME FOR MY DENIAL I SCARCELY DARE TO SPEAK SAID LORD MONTFORT IN A LOW TONE AS IF SUPPRESSING HIS EMOTION IF I WERE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS I MIGHT AGITATE YOU
AND WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED
OH YOU ARE THERE ARE YOU
SHE IS ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE TOO BUT YOU ARE ONLY MY FAVOURITE FOR THE MOMENT I ALWAYS HAVE TWO FAVOURITES ONE FOR THE MOMENT AND ONE THAT I NEVER CHANGE AND THAT IS MY SWEET HENRIETTA TEMPLE YOU SEE I CAN REMEMBER HER NAME THOUGH I COULDN'T YOURS
AND HOLDING THIS CHERISHED TESTIMONY OF HIS FELICITY TO HIS HEART SLEEP AT LENGTH DESCENDED UPON THE EXHAUSTED FRAME OF FERDINAND ARMINE
THE MOST SPLENDID PICTURES AND LONG ROWS OF GRACEFUL OR SOLEMN STATUES WERE SUDDENLY REVEALED TO HER ROOMS AND GALLERIES WERE OPENED THAT HAD NEVER BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE ON ALL SIDES CABINETS OF VASES
I WILL NOT THEN VENTURE TO REPLY TO WHAT YOU HAVE URGED TO TELL YOU I THINK YOU THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ENGAGING BEING THAT EVER BREATHED OR HOW I DOTE UPON YOUR PENSIVE SPIRIT AND CAN SIT FOR HOURS TOGETHER GAZING ON THE LANGUAGE OF THOSE DARK EYES
I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME LIGHT UP THIS DARK HOUSE SOME NIGHT AND GIVE YOU AN ITALIAN PARTY I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH SAID MISTER TEMPLE WHENEVER HENRIETTA DID NOT ENTER HER NEGATIVE LORD MONTFORT ALWAYS IMPLIED HER ASSENT
HE LOOKED LITTLE LIKE A PLEDGED AND TRIUMPHANT LOVER
MY TRIBUNE TIS OPEN TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME HENRIETTA ACCEPTED HIS PROFFERED ARM AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE PRINCESS HE SAID AS THEY WALKED ALONG IT IS AGREEABLE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOUR GUESTS AMUSE THEMSELVES
THEY ARRIVED AT TWILIGHT AND THE SHADOWY HOUR LENT EVEN ADDITIONAL SPACE TO THE HUGE HALLS AND GALLERIES YET IN THE SUITE OF ROOMS INTENDED FOR MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS DAUGHTER EVERY SOURCE OF COMFORT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED
UPON THIS SLIGHT SERVICE AY THAT THE OFFERING MIGHT BE MADE IN THE SPIRIT OF MOST RESPECTFUL AFFECTION AND NOT ALTOGETHER BE DEVOID OF FAVOUR IN YOUR SIGHT EXCELLENT KIND HEARTED MAN SAID SIR RATCLIFFE
IN WHICH CAPTAIN ARMINE PROVES HIMSELF A COMPLETE TACTICIAN THE MIDNIGHT MOON FLUNG ITS BROAD BEAMS OVER THE GLADES AND AVENUES OF ARMINE AS FERDINAND RIDING MISS TEMPLE'S HORSE RE ENTERED THE PARK
LET ME BE PIONEER INVITED SIR RATCLIFFE TO FOLLOW HIM THEY ACCORDINGLY ENTERED HIS CHAMBER IT WAS A SMALL ROOM LINED WITH SHELVES OF BOOKS EXCEPT IN ONE SPOT WHERE WAS SUSPENDED A PORTRAIT OF LADY BARBARA
SAID SIR RATCLIFFE THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN THE CHAIR AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY I KNOW NOT WHAT TO FEEL GLASTONBURY ADVANCED AND GENTLY TOOK HIS OTHER HAND
ONE DAY A DISCUSSION ROSE ABOUT ITALIAN SOCIETY BETWEEN MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS HOST HIS LORDSHIP WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF THE DOMESTIC CHARACTER AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THE ITALIANS
AFTER HAVING BEEN HONOURED ON YOUR SIDE WITH A FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN THE CONSOLATION AND CHARM OF MY EXISTENCE INDEED TOO GREAT A BLESSING I DID BELIEVE MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN I REMINDED MYSELF
DEAR SIR RATCLIFFE HE OBSERVED IN HIS USUAL CALM SWEET VOICE
BELIEVE ME HE IS INDEED WORTHY OF YOU I AM NOT WORTHY OF HIM SAID HENRIETTA IN A MELANCHOLY VOICE AH HENRIETTA WHO IS LIKE YOU EXCLAIMED THE FOND AND EXCITED FATHER
GLASTONBURY AND HERE SIR RATCLIFFE BECAME MORE ANIMATED YOU COULD NOT PERMIT IT MY HONOUR IS SAFE IN YOUR HANDS SIR RATCLIFFE PAUSED FOR A REPLY ON THAT SCORE MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR REPLIED GLASTONBURY
HOW IS YOUR MASTER HOW IS YOUR CHARMING LADY WHERE IS THE PARROT I DON'T WANT IT WHERE'S THE LADY WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER WHY DO YOU STARE SO MISS TEMPLE NO NOT MISS TEMPLE THE LADY MY LADY MY CHARMING FRIEND MISSUS FLOYD
AS FOR FERDINAND THE SPRING HAD GRADUALLY RESTORED HIM TO HEALTH BUT NOT TO HIS FORMER FRAME OF MIND HE REMAINED MOODY AND INDOLENT INCAPABLE OF EXERTION AND A PREY TO THE DARKEST HUMOURS
THE LIGHTNESS OF MY SPIRIT VANISHED THE FRESHNESS OF MY FEELINGS GONE NO MY KIND FRIEND MY DEAR AND GENTLE FRIEND MY AFFECTION FOR YOU IS TOO SINCERE TO ACCEDE TO YOUR REQUEST AND A YEAR HENCE
OF THE UNRESTRAINED MANNER IN WHICH I HAD AVAILED MYSELF OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT FRIENDSHIP I DID BELIEVE ACTUATED BY FEELINGS WHICH PERHAPS I CANNOT DESCRIBE AND THOUGHTS TO WHICH I CANNOT NOW GIVE UTTERANCE THAT I MIGHT VENTURE WITHOUT OFFENCE
AND GLANCED WITH A FLASHING EYE
YOU WOULD CONTRIVE SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO FIND OUT WHAT I WANTED NEVER MIND NEVER MIND COME MY CHARMING FRIEND LET ME TAKE YOUR ARM NOW I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PRETTIEST THE DEAREST THE MOST INNOCENT AND CHARMING LADY IN THE WORLD SHE IS MY GREATEST FAVOURITE
THE AIR OF ELEGANCE AND CHEERFUL COMFORT THAT PERVADED THESE APARTMENTS SO UNUSUAL IN THIS LAND THE BRIGHT BLAZE OF THE FIRE
WAS NOT AWARE THAT LORD MONTFORT'S DEMEANOUR TO HER DIFFERED IN ANY DEGREE FROM WHAT IT WAS AT PISA SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALONE WITH HIM IN HER LIFE
YOU REALLY TAKE A WRONG AN IMPRACTICABLE VIEW OF AFFAIRS LORD MONTFORT MUST BE THE BEST JUDGE OF WHAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OWN HAPPINESS LORD MONTFORT IS ACTING UNDER A DELUSION REPLIED MISS TEMPLE
FED BY OUR IMAGINATION HAVE ASSUMED SUCH GIGANTIC AND SUBSTANTIAL SHAPES RAPIDLY SUBSIDE BY AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE PROCESS INTO LESS COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS AND SEEM INVESTED
AND HIS VOICE COULD NOT POUR FORTH THOSE FATAL SOUNDS THAT HAD RAVISHED HER SOUL FROM THE LIPS OF FERDINAND ARMINE HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE MAGIC OF MUSIC AND WHILE HE HATED A FORMAL CONCERT
HE HAD QUITTED ENGLAND WITH HIS DAUGHTER HE EXPRESSED HIS UNQUALIFIED APPROBATION OF THE OVERTURE OF LORD MONTFORT TO WHOM HE WAS INDEED SINCERELY ATTACHED AND WHICH GRATIFIED ALL THOSE WORLDLY FEELINGS
HE DID NOT CONCEAL FROM MISTER TEMPLE THE CONVICTION THAT IMPELLED HIM TO THE COURSE WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT PROPER TO PURSUE AND THIS DELICATE CONDUCT RELIEVED MISTER TEMPLE GREATLY FROM THE UNAVOIDABLE EMBARRASSMENT OF HIS POSITION
AT THE END OF THE PRINCIPAL GALLERY HENRIETTA PERCEIVED AN OPEN DOOR WHICH ADMITTED THEM INTO A SMALL OCTAGON CHAMBER OF IONIC ARCHITECTURE THE WALLS WERE NOT HUNG WITH PICTURES
OH IF WE HAD BUT MET EARLIER SAID HENRIETTA TEMPLE IF WE HAD BUT KNOWN EACH OTHER A YEAR AGO WHEN I WAS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT MORE WORTHY OF YOU BUT NOW WITH HEALTH SHATTERED
THE WORLD THAT SURROUNDS HIM IS NOT THE WORLD OF WORKING MAN IT IS FAIRY LAND HE IS NOT OF THE SAME ORDER AS THE LABOURING MYRIADS ON WHICH HE SEEMS TO TREAD
PRESENTED TO THEM THE SERVANT WHO WAS TO ASSUME THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD AND THEN REMINDING THEM OF THEIR MUTUAL PROMISES THAT THEY WERE TO BE ENTIRELY THEIR OWN MASTERS AND NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM ANY MORE THAN IF THEY WERE AT PISA
FOR HER LADYSHIP WAS IN EVERY RESPECT A MEMORABLE CHARACTER
WITH JOHN ON ONE SIDE AND JIM ON THE OTHER MISSUS PERSHING AND THE GIRLS FOLLOWING ALONG JOHN F PERSHING WAS A STRONG UNION MAN AND ALTHOUGH LOCAL FEELING RAN HIGH BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH HE RETAINED THE ESTEEM OF HIS NEIGHBORS
HE HAS LIMITLESS PATIENCE JOINED WITH A WONDERFUL BREADTH OF VIEW HIS METHODS RESEMBLE THE HEAD OF A GREAT BUSINESS IN HIS INTRICATE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTING THE ARMY HE REVEALED ANOTHER AND SURPRISING SIDE TO HIS NATURE
THE PUNITIVE EXPEDITION INTO MEXICO WAS A CASE IN POINT IT WAS A THANKLESS JOB AT BEST AND FULL OF HARDSHIP AND DANGER A DAY'S MARCH OF THIRTY MILES ACROSS AN ALKALI DESERT UNDER A BLAZING SUN IS HARDLY A PLEASURE JAUNT
IT WAS ACTUALLY WELCOMED ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE ROBERTS GIVES A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY HE AND A NATIVE SERVANT WERE CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN WHEN THE STORM DESCENDED WITH LITTLE WARNING
LIKE MANY ANOTHER SOLDIER HE WAS A FIRM BELIEVER IN LUCK AND HERE CERTAINLY THE FATES WERE PROPITIOUS
AND GUARDED THE ENTRANCE TO KHYBER PASS
HE WAS NOT LAX AND RULED HIS FAMILY WELL THE PERSHING FAMILY WERE ZEALOUS CHURCH PEOPLE JOHN F PERSHING WAS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE METHODIST CHURCH ALL THE YEARS HE LIVED HERE EVERY SUNDAY YOU COULD SEE HIM MAKING HIS WAY TO CHURCH
YET HE DIDN'T SHINE PARTICULARLY AS A STUDENT HE WAS SIMPLY BUSY THINKING IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS SENT TO COLLEGE AT PERPIGNAN THAT HE REALLY BEGAN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN BOOKS AND HIS FAVORITES WERE THE MORE SOLID STUDIES ALGEBRA
PHILIPPINES NINETEEN O FIVE MARRIED FRANCES WARREN NINETEEN O SIX BRIGADIER GENERAL NINETEEN FOURTEEN RECALLED FROM PHILIPPINES
THE OUTLAWS LAUGHED NOISILY AND SWORE BY WAY OF REPLY YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME ALONG HE WENT ON WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE MY MEN ARE POSTED ALL AROUND THIS CABIN MORE PROFANITY
IN A VERY PRIMITIVE HOUSE JOHN JOSEPH PERSHING WAS BORN SEPTEMBER THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE BOY INHERITED A STURDY FRAME AND A LOVE OF FREEDOM FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE FAMILY HIS MOTHER HAD COME OF A RACE QUITE AS GOOD AS THAT OF HIS FATHER
HE IS RODIN'S STATUE OF THE THINKER COME TO LIFE IMPORTANT DATES IN JOFFRE'S LIFE EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
HE TURNED OVER HIS DUTIES OF DEPUTY ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER GENERAL TO HIS SUCCESSOR THOUGH MUCH AGAINST HIS WILL HE FELT THAT AGAIN HE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING PUT UPON THE SHELF AND HIS INTENSELY ACTIVE NATURE LONGED FOR STILL FURTHER FIELD SERVICE
IT WAS A WILD AND TREACHEROUS LAND AND THE RELIEF EXPEDITION WOULD SCARCELY HAVE CHILD'S PLAY OF IT
AFTER THE SOUDANESE ADVENTURE CAME A TRIP TO MADAGASCAR THIS TIME MORE FORT CONSTRUCTING FROM WHICH IT SEEMED THAT HE COULD NEVER ESCAPE THE PROBLEM DOWN THERE WAS A VEXATIOUS ONE DUE TO A DO NOTHING POLICY OF A PREDECESSOR
HE RODE STRAIGHT UP TO THE ZUNI CHIEF WHO WAS NOW ON THE WARPATH AND TOLD HIM HE MUST CALL OFF HIS BRAVES THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD PUNISH THESE MEN THE CHIEF FINALLY GRUNTED ASSENT
AND THE PURSUIT WAS BEING FOLLOWED UP IN BRAVE STYLE
THE HOMELY KINDLY FIGURE OF JOFFRE MAY WELL FIND PLACE HE SEEMS TO OCCUPY A NICHE QUITE BY HIMSELF HE IS NOT SPECTACULAR NOR A HERO BUT A SIMPLE MAN AMONG MEN WHOSE RESULTS ARE BUILT UPON A LIFETIME OF PATIENT ENDEAVOR
HIS ALL AROUND QUALITIES MADE HIM MANY FRIENDS AMONG BOTH FACULTY AND STUDENTS HE WAS MADE RANKING CADET CAPTAIN IN HIS SENIOR YEAR AND CHOSEN CLASS PRESIDENT TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER WRITING FROM CLEAR AROUND THE WORLD AT MANILA TO HIS CLASS AT A REUNION
HIS EXPERIENCES IN THE WILD WEST AND IT WAS THE WILD WEST IN THOSE DAYS CANNOT BE PASSED OVER WITHOUT RELATING ONE TYPICAL ANECDOTE THREE CATTLE RUSTLERS WHITE MEN HAD GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT WITH THE ZUNI INDIANS
IT GAVE THE GERMAN PLAN WITH A MASTERY OF DETAIL SHREWD PROPHECY AND EARNEST WARNING THE FUTURE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE WAS CONVINCED OF THE CERTAINTY OF THE CONFLICT AND BESOUGHT THE AUTHORITIES TO MAKE BETTER PREPARATION BUT HIS WARNINGS FELL UPON DEAF EARS
HAD ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSE IN A STRANGE THING GREASED CARTRIDGES
YOU DO NOT THINK THAT YOU ARE TOO OLD FOR THIS ARDUOUS TASK ASKED THE QUEEN YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOUR HEALTH BREAKING DOWN I HAVE KEPT MYSELF FIT REPLIED THE OLD SOLDIER FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE HOPE THAT I MIGHT COMMAND IN SUCH A CAMPAIGN AS THIS
ROBERTS HIMSELF HAS LEFT AN ENTERTAINING STORY OF HIS LIFE IN FORTY ONE YEARS IN INDIA WHICH SHOWS THAT A SOLDIER'S LIFE IS NOT TINSEL AND PARADE BUT IS MADE UP OF INFINITE HARDSHIP THE WEAK BOY MUST INDEED HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG WILL IN ORDER TO PULL THROUGH
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO IN HIS TWENTIETH YEAR HE RECEIVED HIS FIRST MARCHING ORDERS THEY WERE TO REPORT FOR DUTY HE SET SAIL BY WAY OF SUEZ BUT THERE WAS NO CANAL IN THOSE DAYS TO MAKE POSSIBLE AN ALL WATER JOURNEY INSTEAD AT ALEXANDRIA HE CHANGED TO A SMALL INLAND STEAMER
HE WELCOMED NEW FIELDS HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AS AIDE AND RIGHT HAND MAN TO SIR JOHN FRENCH THE GENERAL WHOM HE WAS TO SUCCEED IN LATER YEARS ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF FRANCE IN THIS WAR HAIG IS NOT CREDITED WITH MANY PERSONAL EXPLOITS
HE ORDERED RIGHT WHEEL INTO LINE TO BE SOUNDED THE TRUMPET JERKED OUT A SHRILL NOTE
THROUGHOUT THE FOUR LONG YEARS OF WAR HE FACED THE ENEMY WITH A CALM COURAGE WHICH IF IT EVER WAVERED GAVE NO OUTWARD SIGN AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THE LITTLE CONTEMPTIBLES GREW AND GREW
AND SAYING WITH THEIR ALLIES YOU SHALL NOT PASS IMPORTANT DATES IN HAIG'S LIFE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE JUNE NINETEENTH DOUGLAS HAIG BORN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
ONE OF THE OFFICERS COLONEL NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN WAS ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE MOVABLE COLUMN OR CHIEF ARMY OF PURSUIT ROBERTS WAS MADE ONE OF HIS STAFF OFFICERS THE MOST WONDERFUL PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE THAT COULD COME TO ME HE SAYS SHORTLY AFTERWARD
THEN MAJOR GENERAL AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WORLD WAR HE WAS HURRIEDLY SENT TO FRANCE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SIR JOHN FRENCH HIS OLD LEADER IN AFRICA FRENCH WAS GENEROSITY ITSELF IN HIS PRAISE OF HAIG IN THESE EARLY DAYS OF DISASTER
IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THIS STRONG SOLDIER WAS TO HAVE NO REST THAT HIS MUSCLES WERE TO BE KEPT CONSTANTLY INURED TO HARDSHIP SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF A GREATER CALL TO ARMS HERE WOULD BE ONE COMMANDER TRAINED TO THE MINUTE
SUCH WAS GENERAL PERSHING WHEN HE SET FOOT ON FOREIGN SHORE AT THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN ARMY THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT OUR SOLDIERS HAD EVER SERVED ON EUROPEAN SOIL AMERICA WAS AT LAST REPAYING TO FRANCE HER DEBT OF GRATITUDE
AS USUAL HAIG PINNED HIS FAITH UPON THE CAVALRY ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF THIS ARM OF THE SERVICE AND WAS OF OPINION THAT IT WAS NOT UTILIZED IN MODERN WARFARE NEARLY SO MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE HE WAS A WARM ADMIRER OF THE AMERICAN OFFICER
FOR AID RECEIVED NEARLY A CENTURY AND A HALF EARLIER AND IT WAS AN ALSATIAN BY DESCENT WHO COULD NOW SAY LAFAYETTE WE COME WHO WAS THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR SO IMPORTANT A TASK
ONE REASON FOR HIS SLOW ADVANCEMENT WAS THAT HE WAS NO POLITICIAN OR TIME SERVER HE NEVER PUSHED HIMSELF FORWARD
IS EVINCED BY ANOTHER INCIDENT OF THIS MARCH IN SOUDAN AN INSECT'S STING HAD POISONED HIS LEFT EYE SO SEVERELY THAT THE SIGHT WAS THREATENED
AS HE REALIZED THAT HIS USEFULNESS IN THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD BE VASTLY INCREASED IF HE COULD DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE NATIVES THIS WAS A TURNING POINT IN ROBERTS CAREER IT WAS TO BE HIS FIRST STEPPING STONE UPWARD AND IT ILLUSTRATES THE POINT THAT EVEN THOUGH OPPORTUNITY MAY KNOCK AT THE DOOR
IN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR HOWEVER HE WAS RECALLED TO INDIA AND THERE GIVEN A UNIQUE TASK THE FIRST VICEROY TO INDIA
I HAVE SOLVED IT I WILL GET WELL
THE SON WHO WAS DESTINED TO WIN STILL HIGHER HONORS BEGAN HIS CAREER SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
AND BROUGHT IT TO HIM IT WAS A PAIR OF BLUE GLASSES
AND NOW WROTE HIM A WELCOME NOTE BIDDING HIM COME TO JOIN HIM THIS WAS EASIER SAID THAN DONE BUT WAS FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THREE MONTHS OF TOILSOME AND DANGEROUS TRAVEL HE USED EVERY SORT OF NATIVE CONVEYANCE BARGE POST CHAISE PALANQUIN PONY AND SHANK'S MARES
HE GIVES A LONG BREEZY ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCE THERE FROM WHICH WE HAVE SPACE TO QUOTE ONLY A FEW SENTENCES THIS BRINGS UP A PERIOD OF WEST POINT LIFE WHOSE VIVID IMPRESSIONS WILL BE THE LAST TO FADE MARCHING INTO CAMP PILING BEDDING
THE SOLDIER'S DUTY IS TO GO WHEREVER THERE IS FIGHTING HE SAID AND VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED THE IDEA THAT HE BE GIVEN A SWIVEL CHAIR JOB HIS FIRST TERM OF SERVICE IN THE PHILIPPINES WAS FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO NINETEEN O THREE
AND THE FATHER CONTINUED TO LIVE THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS OR MORE IT IS RELATED OF HIM THAT EVEN AS A BABY JOSEPH NEVER CRIED
HERE WAS HER CHANCE TRAMP TRAMP RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT SHE HEARD THE STEPS COME NEARER AND NEARER SHE LOOKED THERE WAS A SOLDIER COMING ALONG
MAY HEAVEN REWARD YOUR FRIENDSHIP SAID HANS AND AT ONCE GAVE HIM THE COW THE MAN UNTIED THE PIG FROM THE WHEELBARROW
BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN A STORY ABOUT A TINDER BOX YES BUT THEN IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL ONE
AND THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL UPON THE SNOW AND THE RED LOOKED PRETTY UPON THE WHITE SNOW AND SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF WOULD THAT I HAD A CHILD AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS THE WOOD OF THE WINDOW FRAME
SHE SAID AND I WILL SET THEM TO WORK UPON THE MUSLIN THE PRINCE HAD BEGUN TO SUSPECT BY THIS TIME THAT THE WHITE CAT WAS NO ORDINARY PUSSY BUT WHENEVER HE BEGGED HER TO TELL HIM HER HISTORY SHE ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY
THE FIRST SAID WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR THE SECOND WHO HAS BEEN EATING OFF MY PLATE THE THIRD WHO HAS BEEN TAKING SOME OF MY BREAD THE FOURTH
HANS RAISED THE STONE AND MARCHED ON WITH A JOYFUL HEART HIS EYES SHINING WITH PLEASURE I MUST HAVE BEEN BORN LUCKY HE CRIED OUT ALL THAT I DESIRE COMES TO ME AS TO A SUNDAY CHILD
THE LITTLE YELLOW BIRD FLEW IN AND PERCHED ON HER SHOULDER AND SANG HER SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG ABOUT HER SISTERS IN THE SKY THAT SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND SLIPPED OUT AND RAN LIKE THE WIND AND GOT TO THE DANCING RING
AND SO ENCIRCLE THE HIND THEN GRADUALLY NARROWING THE CIRCLE HE PRESSED FORWARD TILL HE COULD DISTINCTLY SEE THE WHITE HIND PANTING IN THE MIDST NEARER AND NEARER HE ADVANCED
YOU HAVE ONLY TO SAY TO YOUR OWN GOAT LITTLE GOAT IF YOU'RE ABLE PRAY DECK OUT MY TABLE AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WILL BE A PRETTY LITTLE TABLE BEFORE YOU
BUT WHOEVER ATE A PIECE OF IT MUST SURELY DIE WHEN THE APPLE WAS READY SHE PAINTED HER FACE AND DRESSED HERSELF UP AS A COUNTRY WOMAN AND SO SHE WENT OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TO THE SEVEN DWARFS SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
MEANWHILE HAVING BEEN ON HIS LEGS SINCE DAYBREAK HE BEGAN TO FEEL TIRED BESIDES WHICH HE WAS TORMENTED BY HUNGER FOR HE HAD EATEN UP ALL HIS PROVISION IN HIS JOY OVER THE EXCHANGE OF THE COW
STRIKE IT TWICE AND THE DOG WITH EYES AS BIG AS MILL WHEELS APPEARED STRIKE IT THRICE AND THERE APPEARED THE MONSTER DOG WITH EYES THAT ROLLED ROUND AND ROUND AND WERE AS LARGE AS THE ROUND TOWER ITSELF
HE CAN DO IT EASILY ENOUGH AND WILLINGLY INTO THE BARGAIN JUST GO THE MAN'S HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE WAS VERY UNWILLING TO GO HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT'S NOT RIGHT BUT AT LAST HE WENT
WELL THEY BEGAN TO WONDER UPSTAIRS HOW IT WAS THAT SHE WAS SO LONG DRAWING THE BEER AND HER MOTHER WENT DOWN TO SEE AFTER HER AND SHE FOUND HER SITTING ON THE SETTLE CRYING AND THE BEER RUNNING OVER THE FLOOR
TAKE THEM MY CHILD HE SAID AND CHERISH THEM FOR THEY HAVE COST YOUR POOR FATHER HIS LIFE AND WITH THAT HE SAT DOWN AND TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY THE TWO ELDER SISTERS WEPT AND WAILED AND OF COURSE BLAMED BEAUTY FOR ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
OF LITTLE PEOPLE HE SAID BUT THIS IS WONDERFUL TO COME AND DO THE WORK FOR A PAN OF COLD WATER WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT
WHERE HE NEVER BEFORE HAD BEEN NOT KNOWING IN WHICH DIRECTION HIS PATH LAY HE CALLED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE HUNTERS AT LAST A HOARSE VOICE ANSWERED HIM AND FROM THE HOLLOW TRUNK OF A LIME TREE
ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT A WEEK AND TWO DAYS HAD GONE BY SINCE SHE LEFT THE BEAST YET AFTER THAT DREAM SHE AT ONCE TURNED THE RUBY TOWARDS HER PALM
SAID THE WOMAN IS NOT THIS NICE YES SAID THE MAN AND SO LET IT REMAIN WE CAN LIVE HERE VERY HAPPILY WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT SAID THE WOMAN AND WITH THAT THEY ATE SOMETHING AND WENT TO BED
WAS AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OR VERY NEARLY ALL COULD SPEAK JUST AS WELL AS YOU OR I AND NOBODY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THEM TALK AS I SUPPOSE ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS WELL
THAT HAD BEEN BORN DURING HIS ABSENCE HIS JOY WAS SO GREAT THAT HE FORGOT ALL ELSE BUT AFTER A TIME HE RECALLED WITH HORROR HIS COMPACT WITH THE MONSTER OF THE WELL AND THE MEANING WAS ALL PLAIN TO HIM
COME AND CLEAR AWAY MY TABLE IT VANISHED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND THEN TWO EYES WOKE UP ONE EYE AND SAID LITTLE ONE EYE YOU ARE A CLEVER ONE TO WATCH GOATS FOR
THE BRANCHES ABOVE HER HEAD WOULD BE FILLED WITH THE BIRDS THAT CAME THITHER TO LISTEN THE THICKETS AROUND HER WOULD BE CROWDED WITH BEASTS AND THE WATERS ROLLING BESIDE HER WOULD BE ALIVE WITH FISHES
A PROPER SCISSORS GRINDER IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO WHENEVER HE PUTS HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET FINDS MONEY THERE BUT WHERE HAVE YOU BOUGHT THAT FINE GOOSE I DID NOT BUY IT BUT EXCHANGED IT FOR MY PIG AND THE PIG
AN OLD MAN CAME ALONG AND DIGGING UP THE FLOWER CARRIED IT HOME WITH HIM AND PLANTED IT IN HIS GARDEN HE WATERED AND TENDED IT CAREFULLY AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE FLOWER BECAME A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
AND SHE SAT HER DOWN BESIDE THE DAUGHTER AND STARTED CRYING TOO THEN AFTER A BIT THE FATHER BEGAN TO WONDER THAT THEY DIDN'T COME BACK AND HE WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO LOOK AFTER THEM HIMSELF AND THERE THEY
AND IT ANSWERED AS BEFORE O QUEEN THOU ART FAIREST OF ALL I SEE BUT OVER THE HILLS WHERE THE SEVEN DWARFS DWELL SNOW WHITE IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL AND NO ONE ELSE IS SO FAIR AS SHE
BUT DO NOT TELL YOUR WIFE FOR RED SWANS CANNOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN AND THEY CAN TELL IF ONE COMES WITHIN A MILE OF THEM HIGH FEATHER HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF A RED SWAN BEFORE ALL THE RED FEATHERS HE WORE HE HAD HAD TO PAINT
HERE'S A TO DO SHE SAID FARMER HODGE HAS THIS VERY MINUTE TOLD ME THAT HE HEARS YOUR GRANNIE ISN'T QUITE WELL AND I CAN'T LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING FOR LOVE OR MONEY DO YOU GO MY DEAR
THE STAR WIFE IN THE DAYS WHEN THE BUFFALO RACED AND THUNDERED OVER THE EARTH AND THE STARS DANCED AND SANG IN THE SKY A BRAVE YOUNG HUNTER LIVED ON THE BANK OF BATTLE RIVER
BEAUTY WILL YOU MARRY ME AND BEAUTY BESIDE HERSELF WITH JOY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE ANSWERED YES YES DEAR BEAST FOR I LOVE YOU DEARLY
AND CHARMING WAS SO AWED BY ALL THIS SPLENDOR THAT AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SPEAK RECOVERING HIMSELF IN A MOMENT HE TOLD OF HIS MISSION AND SET FORTH THE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE KING IN SUCH GLOWING TERMS THAT THE PRINCESS LISTENED
YOU HAVE ARGUED SO ELOQUENTLY REPLIED SHE THAT I REGRET TO DENY YOU BUT I HAVE MADE A VOW NOT TO MARRY UNTIL THE AMBASSADOR CAN RETURN TO ME A RING WHICH I LOST IN THE RIVER A MONTH AGO
AND WHAT WERE THE WORDS MY MARY THAT THEN YOU HEARD THEM SAY I'LL TELL YOU ALL MY MOTHER
THREE SILLIES ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A FARMER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD ONE DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS COURTED BY A GENTLEMAN
THINKING SHE HAD EATEN SNOW WHITE'S HEART BEGAN TO SUPPOSE SHE WAS AGAIN THE FIRST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD AND SHE WENT TO HER LOOKING GLASS AND SAID LOOKING GLASS LOOKING GLASS ON THE WALL
WELL TIE THE ROPE ROUND MY WAIST SAID THE SOLDIER
AT LAST SHE WAS WELL PLEASED FOR SHE KNEW THE LOOKING GLASS SPOKE THE TRUTH NOW SNOW WHITE GREW UP AND BECAME MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL AND WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY
THERE WAS ONE FACULTY SHE POSSESSED IN A MORE REMARKABLE DEGREE THAN ANY WOMAN OF THE TRIBE IT WAS THAT OF SINGING
AND GAVE THE ROPE WITH WHICH IT WAS BOUND INTO HANS'S HAND HANS MARCHED ON THINKING WHAT A LUCKY FELLOW I AM AS SOON AS ANYTHING GOES WRONG SOMETHING TURNS UP AND ALL'S RIGHT AGAIN
WHERE HIGH FEATHER'S MOTHER WAS MOURNING FOR THEM AND THERE WAS A GREAT FEAST IN THE VILLAGE BECAUSE THEY HAD COME BACK SAFE AND SOUND THE STAR WIFE FINISHED EMBROIDERING HER DANCING CLOTH THAT DAY AND WHENEVER THE INDIANS DANCED SHE DANCED WITH THEM
THEN SHE BADE HIM GOOD BY AND HE MOUNTED THE WOODEN HORSE AND RODE AWAY THIS TIME THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS SO LATE THAT HIS BROTHERS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO DISPLAY THEIR PIECES OF MUSLIN TO THE KING WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE GATES
TAKE YOUR TROUBLES TO THE MOUNTAINS IF YOU ARE PUEBLO AZTEC YOU CAN SELECT SOME BIG MOUNTAIN AND PRAY TO IT AS ITS TOP SHOWS THE RED SENTIENCE OF THE ON COMING DAY
ONE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS THEREFORE WELL THAT THE YOUNGER BOY SHOULD CLASP TIGHTLY THE HAND OF THE OLDER HIM WHO BORE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE THE BOW AND ARROWS
THOUGH IT WAS STILL CLEAR AND RESONANT IN ITS OWN PECULIAR WAY AND VERY FINE AND SWEET I WILL TELL YOU WHICH TROPHY YOU MOST PRIZE IT SAID I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR ILIAD OF THE CHASE DO YOU NOT REMEMBER
REGRET REMORSE DESPAIR ABANDONMENT THE HOPELESSNESS OF HUMANITY WAS IT THE BREATH OF THESE WHICH AROSE AND BURDENED HEAVILY THE NOTE OF THE CHRONICLING BELL
AND WITH SMALL HAZEL TREES WHICH SOON WOULD OFFER FRUIT FOR THE REGULAR HARVEST OF THE FALL THIS SAME TO BE SPREAD FOR DRYING ON THE WOODSHED ROOF IT WAS PERHAPS WISE CURIOSITY AS TO THE CROP OF NUTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT THUS FAR FROM HOME THESE TWO FIGURES
I COULD HEAR VOICES THAT SANG UP AND UP THRILLING COMPELLING THE SENSE OF THE CONFINEMENT OF THE BUILDING CEASED INSENSIBLY I SEEMED TO SEE THE HEWN STONES OF THE WALLS
INSTEAD OF SOMBER AND BLACK THESE SPARROWS BEGIN TO CHATTER AND CHIRP AND SING IN DISCORDANT NOTES AND BY THIS I KNOW THE DAY HAS COME
FOLDING DOWN THE TOP AND THERE IS THE CRASH OF THE THUNDER AND THIS IS THE RUSH OF THE RAIN
OUT THERE ON THE WATER THOSE ARE NOT RIPPLES THAT IS SILVER THERE WILL BE ANGELS WALKING ON THAT PATHWAY BEFORE LONG THAT IS NOT THE MOON COMING UP OVER THE LAKE IT IS THE SWINGING OPEN
DO YOU HEAR IT DO YOU HEAR THE TALKING OF THE LEAVES I KNOW WHAT THE OAK SAYS SAID THE SINGING MOUSE WHEN THE WIND IS SOFT THE OAK SAYS PEACE PEACE WHEN THE BREEZE IS SHARP
THE WORLD WITHOUT THE SHADOWS TOO WHAT WOULD BE OUR LIVES THOUGHTS THOUGHTS AND REMEMBRANCES WHAT HAVE WE THAT IS SWEETER THAN THESE
RUSTLE NOW YE LEAVES AND THREATEN NOW ALL YE BOUGHS WITH MENACINGS
ALWAYS THE ROSE IS THERE DO YOU SEE HIM LOOK UP AT THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT HIM AT THE TREES DO YOU SEE HIM LAY HIS HEAD UPON THE EARTH DO YOU STILL SEE HIS SMILE THE SMILE WHICH IS WEARY AND YET NOT AFRAID
AND BEFORE HIM I SAW DRAWN AS THOUGH IN ANOTHER PICTURE
I THINK HE RIDES TO BATTLE WITH THE ROSE KNOWING WHAT FATE WILL COME YOU KNOW OF THIS BITING WHISTLE IN THE AIR THIS SMALL THING THAT SMITES UNSEEN
THE TRUE FAITH IS NOTHING FINAL NOT MORE THAN ARE FINAL THE CARVED STONES OF THE CHURCH WHICH OFFERS IT SO STRENUOUSLY THE STONES CRUMBLE AND DECAY
AN ENORMOUS DISTANCE PERHAPS AT LEAST A MILE BEYOND WHAT HERETOFORE HAD BEEN THE UTMOST LIMIT OF THEIR WANDERINGS IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SAFE TO VENTURE SO FAR THERE WERE KNOWN TO BE STRANGE CREATURES IN THESE WOODS
THAT WONDROUS UNSYLLABLED VOICE OF COMFORT WHICH ANY MOUNTAIN GOER KNOWS AY THE GOODNESS OF SUCH STRENGTH UP BY THE CLEAN SNOW OVER THE BIG ROCKS
BUT STILL IT WELCOMED THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST SO THE FIRE AND THE GRASS AND THE OAK AND THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST WERE FRIENDS AND EACH YEAR THEY MET HERE IT HAD BEEN THUS FOR MANY YEARS
A PIPING OF FIFES SO FINE A TOUCHING OF STRINGS SO DELICATE THAT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM INSTRUMENTS OF BERYL AND OF DIAMOND A PHANTOM MUSIC
WITHOUT THESE THERE CAN BE NO PICTURE ANYWHERE HAVE YOU NOT SEEN WHAT THE SHADOWS DO HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THEM TROOPING THROUGH THE OAK FOREST IN THE EVENING THROUGH THE PINE FOREST IN OPEN DAY
ONE COULD ONLY GUESS IF HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF GARB OR OF THE OUTLINE OF A FORM AMONG THE SHADOWS HE COULD ONLY GUESS TOO WHETHER HE HEARD MUSIC FAINT AS THE BREEZE
AND AS IN A DREAM AND AS THOUGH I WERE NOW THE YOUNG MAN WHOM WE HAD LATELY SEEN
HAD MADE MANY STROKES THE LAST TIME IT HAD BEEN HEARD MANY HEAVY STROKES WHICH THROBBED SULLENLY MOURNFULLY ON THE AIR THE PRESENCE OF PASSING TIME WAS AT HAND
AND SO I GAZED WHERE THE SINGING MOUSE POINTED QUITE BEYOND THE DUSTY WALLS AND THERE I SAW AS IT HAD SAID I HEARD NOT THE THUNDER OF THE HOOFS OF BUFFALO NOR THE FAINT CRACK OF THE TWIG BENEATH THE PANTHER'S FOOT
I COULD HEAR THE PEAL OF THE ORGAN ARISE LIKE VOICES OF THE SPIRITS GOING UP UP WHISPERING APPEALING PROMISING ASSURING THEN FOR I COULD SEE AND HEAR WITH HIM THERE CAME TO THAT YOUNG MAN
THE SINGING MOUSE BALANCED AND MOVED ITSELF IN HARMONY WITH THE BEAT OF THE FIRE'S RAYS I LOOKED AT IT SO CLOSELY THAT A DREAM CAME UPON MY EYES SO THAT THE VOICE OF THE SINGING MOUSE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND FAINT
EACH YEAR FOR MANY YEARS THE SAME HAND HAD LAID THE LITTLE FIRE IN THE SAME PLACE AND SO GIVEN BACK TO THE OAK ITS PAST NOW THE PAST IS A VERY SAD BUT TENDER THING
NO LONGER CAN YE STRIKE TERROR INTO THESE TWO SOULS SMALL THOUGH THEY BE THE HEART OF THE HUNTER HAS NOW BEEN BORN FOR EACH FEAR AND DEFEAT ARE KNOWN NO LONGER IN THE COMPASS OF THEIR THOUGHTS FOLLOW FOLLOW FOLLOW
THE SINGING MOUSE PEEPED OUT FROM THE HOLLOW ORBIT OF THE WHITE SKULL WHICH LIES UPON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE IT REACHED DOWN A TINY PINK PAW AND TOUCHED A LEAF OF THE BRAVE RED ROSE WHICH EVERY DAY LIES BEFORE THE SKULL
ASSUME THEIR PRIMEVAL AND UNTOUCHED STATE BENEATH THE GRASSES OF THE HILLS I COULD FEEL THE RAFTERS VANISHING AND GOING BACK INTO THE BODIES OF THE OAKS
AS IF IT KNEW MY THOUGHT THE SINGING MOUSE SAID TO ME YOUR VISION IS TOO NARROW YOU SEEK THE GREAT TRUTHS IN SMALL PLACES AND WONDER THAT YOU DO NOT FIND THEM COME WITH ME
THERE IT HAS TURNED IT IS NEAR THE ROAD LOOK THERE IT IS A GREAT ANIMAL HALF THE LENGTH OF ONE'S ARM WITH BUSHY LONG RED TAIL ARCHED HIGH FOR EASIER RUNNING ITS GRAYISH COAT SHOWING IN THE BARS OF SUNLIGHT
HE HAS LIVED AGAIN IN THE CYCLE OF NATURAL FORCES MY DUST WHEN I AM DEAD WILL IN TURN MAKE PART OF THIS WORLD ONE OF AN UNKNOWN SEA OF STARS
ROLLED SOFTLY BACK DIVIDING THE TWO HILLS IN PEACEFUL SEPARATION AND THERE WERE THE OAKS AT THE WATER'S EDGE NEAR THE LESSER SPRING THE WILD APPLE TREES TWISTED BUT UPON THE HILLS AND OVER THE GREAT GLADES
IT SEEMED TO ME I SAW THE SILVER COMING UPON THE HEAD OF THE YOUNGER MAN AND HIS EYES GROWING WEARY
THERE ARE ALWAYS GREAT PICTURES WAITING FOR US PICTURES IN PEARL AND OPAL IN LIQUID ARGENT IN CRIMSON AND GOLD BUT ALWAYS THERE MUST BE THE SHADOWS
WHAT IS IT THIS SOUND APPROACHING COMING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE ROAD SURELY IT MUST BE THE FOOTFALL OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL THIS CADENCED RUSTLING ON THE LEAVES IT COMES IT WILL CROSS NEAR
THESE SHADOWS THAT YOU SEE ARE NOT UPON THE WALL SAID THE SINGING MOUSE THEY ARE VERY MUCH BEYOND THE WINDOWS IF ONLY WE WILL LOOK OUT FROM OUR WINDOWS
THE PREY IS STILL UNREACHED WHAT IS TO BE DONE THE ELDER HUNTER BETHINKS HIM OF A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM THE BROKEN BLADE WILL DO TO GNAW OFF THIS BOUGH AND IT WILL SERVE TO MAKE A SPLIT IN THE END OF IT
AND SINCE THIS WAS IN THE LAND OF THE SINGING MOUSE I SOUGHT TO FIND NO NAME FOR WHAT I SAW NOR TRIED TO MEASURE IT WHAT ONE MAN SEES IS NOT WHAT ANOTHER SEES
BUT WHAT THEN OCCURS I DO NOT KNOW THESE TWO FRIENDS NEVER QUESTIONED THIS THEY KNEW IT WAS THE SECRET OF THE NIGHT AND GAVE THE OAK ITS OWN REQUEST IN PAY FOR ITS PROTECTION AND CONSENT
AM I THE MASTER HERE YOUR SERVANTS REPLIED SHE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY WILL NOT TELL YOU SO BUT I DO YOU CONDESCEND MISTER SANDFORD CRIED MISSUS HORTON
BUT INSTEAD OF THE SYMPATHY THIS MIGHT HAVE EXCITED IN SOME DISPOSITIONS MISTER SANDFORD
YOU MAY HAVE CAUSE TO RECALL IT I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SAID REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE SAID YOU GRANT LADY ELMWOOD'S REQUEST YOU CANNOT RECALL THESE WORDS NOR I MY GRATITUDE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST IS RETURNED HE NOT EXACTLY MY LORD
DID YOU USE ALL THOSE DROPS MISS MILNER GAVE YOU FOR A PAIN IN THE HEAD YES ANSWERED HE I DID BUT THE QUESTION AT THAT MOMENT SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED HIM
MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY SEEING HIS CONSTERNATION AND TREMBLING LEST HE SHOULD GUESS THE SECRET MY LORD MISS MILNER HAS AGAIN DECEIVED YOU YOU MUST NOT TAKE HER FROM LONDON
IT SEEMED BUT A VERY SHORT TIME THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST WHEN THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO TAKE LORD ELMWOOD AWAY DROVE TO THE DOOR MISS MILNER STARTED AT THE SOUND SO DID HE BUT SHE HAD NEARLY DROPPED HER CUP AND SAUCER ON WHICH SANDFORD TOOK THEM OUT OF HER HAND
FOR THAT SHE ALSO LOVED HIM AND FOR BEING HONOURED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF HER FATHER SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH REVERENCE FOR MATILDA WITH AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING A SEDATENESS ABOVE HER YEARS AND EARLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE MOST PRIVATE CONVERSE
AND IN THE NAME OF GOD AND YOUR OWN HAPPINESS SINCE THIS IS THE STATE OF YOU BOTH LET ME PUT IT OUT OF YOUR POWER TO PART LORD ELMWOOD GAZED AT HIM WITH WONDER AND YET AS IF ENRAPTURED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE THIS CONDUCT GAVE TO HIS PROSPECTS
YOU KNOW IT MUST BE YOUR OWN FAULT AND AS THIS IS A THEME THE MOST LIKELY OF ANY NAY THE ONLY ONE ON WHICH WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE SUCH AS WE CANNOT FORGIVE TAKE CARE NEVER FROM THIS DAY TO RESUME IT INDEED
EITHER TO EXHORT HER TO HER DUTY OR TO WARN HER AGAINST HER FOLLY SHE WAS EVEN IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR WITH MISS FENTON AND ADDED FRIENDSHIP TO HOSPITALITY
I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID HE AND YOU CONTINUED SHE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO CHURCH MUSIC WILL BE MORE THAN ANY ONE ENCHANTED WITH HEARING THE SOFTER MUSIC OF LOVE
DIRECTED IMMEDIATELY TO HIM AND A SEVERE WORD OF HIS INSTEAD OF EXASPERATING WAS SURE TO SUBDUE HER THIS WAS THE CASE AT PRESENT HIS WORDS WOUNDED HER TO THE HEART
NAY SHE ANTICIPATED A DISAPPOINTMENT AS SHE HAD BEFORE ANTICIPATED HER SUCCESS BY TURNS FEELING THE KEENEST EMOTIONS FROM HOPE AND FROM DESPAIR AS THESE PASSIONS ALTERNATELY GOVERNED HER
WHEN THE MISFORTUNE IS BUT IDEAL AND MISS MILNER FOUND INFINITE GRATIFICATION IN BEING TOLD
MAY BE OF MORE VALUE TO YOU THAN IT IS TO ME THEREFORE I GIVE IT YOU SANDFORD CALLED UP A LOOK OF SURPRISE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE LETTER AGAIN TIS LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER SAID LORD ELMWOOD AND I RETURN IT TO YOU FOR TWO REASONS
DORRIFORTH SAW HER CONCERN UPON THIS LAST TRIFLING OCCASION WITH A SECRET PLEASURE AND AN ADMIRATION THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXCITED SHE ONCE INSINUATED TO HIM TO BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THEM
BUT THEN WHY ENCOURAGE HIM TO FOLLOW YOU HITHER MISS MILNER WHY COMMIT A THOUSAND FOLLIES SHE REPLIED IN TEARS EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE YOU THEN PROMOTE THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT ONE SERIOUS INTENTION OF COMPLETING THEM
IT WAS AGREED THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THIS ABRUPT PROPOSAL WITH UNEASINESS MISS MILNER TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT IMMEDIATELY CONSENTED
LORD ELMWOOD ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND BROUGHT A CHAIR FOR HER TO SIT DOWN SANDFORD LOOKED AT HER INQUISITIVELY SIPPED HIS TEA AND SAID HE NEVER MADE TEA TO HIS OWN LIKING MISS MILNER TOOK A CUP BUT HAD SCARCE STRENGTH TO HOLD IT
AND I WILL LET HIM KNOW IT IS BY MISTER SANDFORD'S INVITATION YOU ARE COMING SHE LISTENED WITH A SMILE TO THIS PROPOSAL YET OBJECTED TO THE INDELICACY OF HER WISHING TO SEE HIM AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HIS LEAVE
HINT AT MY AFFECTIONS BEING ENGAGED BUT NOT TO WHOM AND ADD THAT I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD IF HE WILL ALLOW ME A SHORT TIME A YEAR OR TWO ONLY I WILL DURING THAT PERIOD TRY TO DISENGAGE THEM
YET SHE WAS CONFIRMED FROM THESE INCREASED SYMPTOMS
AND OH CRIED SHE COULD HER GUARDIAN AND MISTER SANDFORD KNOW OF THIS CONFLICT HOW MUCH WOULD THEY HAVE TO ADMIRE HOW LITTLE TO CONDEMN WITH SUCH FRIENDLY THOUGHTS AND WITH THE PUREST INTENTIONS
PERHAPS I MAY CALL UPON YOU HEREAFTER TO FULFIL YOUR WORD HE WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT WHAT SHE MEANT NOR HAD HE LEISURE FROM THE CONFUSION OF HIS THOUGHTS TO REFLECT UPON HER MEANING HE NEVERTHELESS REPLIED WITH WARMTH DO
I AM UNDECEIVED NOW AND SHALL NEVER TAKE THAT LIBERTY AGAIN AS LORD ELMWOOD ALWAYS TREATED SANDFORD WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT HE BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT UPON THIS OCCASION AND THE DISPOSITION WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO TAKE HIS WARD'S PART
THE EARL RESUMED NOR CAN IT BE A HARDSHIP TO OBEY THIS COMMAND SHE CANNOT LAMENT THE SEPARATION FROM A PARENT WHOM SHE NEVER KNEW SANDFORD WAS GOING EAGERLY TO PROVE THE ERROR OF THAT ASSERTION BUT HE PREVENTED HIM SAYING IN A WORD
DO YOU LOVE THIS WOMAN MORE THAN MY LIFE HE REPLIED WITH THE MOST HEARTFELT ACCENTS HE THEN TURNED TO MISS MILNER CAN YOU SAY THE SAME BY HIM SHE SPREAD HER HANDS OVER HER EYES AND EXCLAIMED OH HEAVENS I BELIEVE YOU CAN SAY SO RETURNED SANDFORD
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LORD FREDERICK SAID MISS WOODLEY TO HERSELF BUT HER UNDERSTANDING COMPELS HER TO SEE HIS FAULTS
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN LORD ELMWOOD AND SANDFORD MET AT BREAKFAST THE LATTER WAS PALE WITH FEAR FOR THE SUCCESS OF LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER THE EARL WAS PALE TOO BUT THERE WAS BESIDES UPON HIS FACE SOMETHING WHICH EVIDENTLY MARKED HE WAS DISPLEASED
WHICH RESTORED HER LOST LOVER TO HER HOPES AGAIN EVEN ON THAT VERY DAY AFTER THE SACRED CEREMONY WAS OVER MISS MILNER WITH ALL THE FEARS THE TREMORS THE SUPERSTITION OF HER SEX FELT AN EXCRUCIATING SHOCK
DORRIFORTH FIXED HIS EYES UPON HER WITH SOME TOKENS OF COMPASSION WHILE SANDFORD SEEMED TO EXULT AND BY HIS REPEATED WELCOMES TO THE BARONET GAVE PROOFS HOW MUCH HE WAS REJOICED TO SEE HIM
THE FOOL BLEST AS THE WISE THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD LOVED WAS EXPRESSED MORE THAN IN WORDS AS HE SAID THIS YOUR LORDSHIP IS TALKING REPLIED SANDFORD OF THE PASSION IN ITS MOST REFINED AND PREDOMINANT SENSE
IF SHE IS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISOBEDIENCE BE ASSURED I SHALL NOT MENTION IT FOR I AM FORBID TO NAME HER AND SURELY AS THAT IS THE CASE I NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK PLAINLY TO YOU I LOVE LADY MATILDA OR PERHAPS UNACQUAINTED WITH LOVE
IS LORD FREDERICK THE MAN YOU APPROVE FOR YOUR HUSBAND UPON THIS CLOSE INTERROGATION SHE DISCOVERED AN EMBARRASSMENT BEYOND ANY SHE HAD EVER YET BETRAYED AND FAINTLY REPLIED NO HE IS NOT
AND THAT TO SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE MOVED BY IT WOULD BE A TACIT CONDEMNATION OF HIS FRIEND'S CONDUCT SHE UNDERSTOOD HIS THOUGHTS AND GETTING THE BETTER OF HER TEARS APOLOGISED FOR HER WEAKNESS ADDING SHE COULD NEVER BEAR WITH INDIFFERENCE AN UNJUST ACCUSATION
OR RETIRING INTO THE COUNTRY SHE RETURNED HOME JUST AS THIS CONVERSATION WAS FINISHED AND SANDFORD THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED RANG FOR HIS CANDLE TO RETIRE MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD BEEN AT THE OPERA WITH MISS MILNER CRIED
SANDFORD OBSERVED IT AND WAS ALL HUMBLENESS BOTH IN HIS WORDS AND LOOKS IN ORDER TO SOFTEN HIM AS SOON AS THE BREAKFAST WAS REMOVED LORD ELMWOOD DREW THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND HOLDING IT TOWARDS SANDFORD SAID THAT
LORD ELMWOOD AFTER REPEATING TO MISS WOODLEY HIS LAST NIGHT'S FAREWELL NOW WENT UP TO MISS MILNER AND TAKING ONE OF HER HANDS AGAIN HELD IT BETWEEN HIS BUT STILL WITHOUT SPEAKING WHILE SHE UNABLE TO SUPPRESS HER TEARS AS HERETOFORE SUFFERED THEM TO FALL IN TORRENTS
EXCUSE WHAT YOU MY DEAR RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
SAYING PERHAPS YOU HAD RATHER HAVE COFFEE HER LIPS MOVED BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID A SERVANT CAME IN AND TOLD LORD ELMWOOD THE CARRIAGE WAS AT THE DOOR HE REPLIED VERY WELL BUT THOUGH HE HAD BREAKFASTED HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE AT LAST
AND I HOPE YOU FOUND BENEFIT FROM THEM SAID MISS MILNER WITH GREAT KINDNESS AS SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM THOUGH MISS WOODLEY FOLLOWED HER SO THAT MISTER SANDFORD WAS LEFT ALONE WITH LORD ELMWOOD
MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE BOTH GENTLEMEN REASON TO BELIEVE A CONTENTION OF THIS NATURE WAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF MISS MILNER'S MIND
SAID SANDFORD I ONLY TOLD YOU WHAT WAS RIGHT NAY SAID MISS WOODLEY SHE DOES NOT WEEP FOR THAT SHE FEARS HER FATHER HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S REQUEST PERHAPS NOT EVEN READ HER LETTER YES HE HAS READ IT RETURNED SANDFORD
BUT FROM HIS INDIFFERENCE TO ALL I HAVE SAID ON THE OCCASION I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED HER NAME TO HIM YOU MAY I WILL MY LORD AND USE ALL MY PERSUASION TO ENGAGE HIS OBEDIENCE AND YOU SHALL HAVE AT LEAST A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE SAYS
HIMSELF INCREDIBLY STEVENSONIAN IN APPEARANCE WITH WHOM WE LAY AFIELD IN OUR LATER TEENS READING R L S ALOUD BY THE BANKS OF A SMALL STREAM WHICH WE VOWED SHOULD BECOME FAMOUS IN THE WORLD OF LETTERS

AH WELL YOU'RE ONE OF THE STEVENSON IDOLATORS AREN'T YOU AND THIS IS SAID WITH A CURIOUS AIR OF CYNICAL SUPERIORITY
WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST

OUR FRIENDS OFTEN LOVE US EVEN ON ACCOUNT OF OUR FAULTS THE HIGHEST LEVEL TO WHICH ATTACHMENT CAN GO AND WHAT AN INFINITE APPEAL THERE IS IN THEIR FACES
PAYS ITS PREMIUMS WITH DECENT REGULARITY
HOW WE GROW TO CHERISH THOSE CURIOUS LITTLE FLESHY CAGES SO ODDLY SCULPTURED WHICH INCLOSE THE SPIRIT WITHIN TO SEE THOSE FACES BENT UNCONSCIOUSLY OVER THEIR TASKS EACH DIFFERENT EACH UNIQUE
ONE REALIZES THE GREAT TIDE OF PUBLIC INTELLIGENCE THAT HAS RISEN PERCEPTIBLY IN RECENT YEARS AT THE HOTEL IN GLOVERSVILLE
KEGS OF OLIVE OIL THICK SLABS OF YELLOW CHEESE ON SUCH A COLD DAY IT WAS PLEASANT TO SEE A SIGN PEANUT ROASTERS AND WARMERS PASSING THE GLOOMY VISTA OF GREENWICH STREET
CROWNED BY AN AFTERNOON AT GREZ ONE REMEMBERS THE OLD GRAY BRIDGE ACROSS THE EDDYING WATER AND THE DOOR OF THE INN WHERE THE YOUNG PILGRIM LINGERED TRYING TO VISUALIZE SCENES OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE
ONE DOES NOT ARGUE FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS NOT ARGUABLE ONE SHRUGS AFTER ALL WHAT HUMAN GESTURE MORE ELOQUENT OR MORE SATISFYING TO THE PERFORMER THAN THE SHRUG
MUST HAVE SOLD IT AGAIN SINCE THE ARMISTICE MUCH RARER WE SAW A COPY OF HOPKINS'S POND THAT LITTLE VOLUME OF AGREEABLE SKETCHES WRITTEN SO LONG AGO BY DOCTOR ROBERT T MORRIS THE WELL KNOWN SURGEON
AN I'D LIKE THE BEST IN THE WORLD TO LOOK OUT FOR HER
THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE WATER GHOST SHOWED SIGNS OF DISTRESS
AN WHILST THEY WERE BOWIN TO EACH OTHER AN BACKIN I GIV ER STIMULUS AN D'RECTLY SHE TURNED
A SWEDENBORGIAN AND A GATES AJAR THAT OF COURSE ENGRAFTED ON TO A METHODIST NOW THAT HOTEL WHEN IT WAS CONSUMED BY FIRE WHICH TO IT WAS THE SAME AS MORTAL DEATH WHY
THE SIGHT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND SO TERRIFYING THAT HE FAINTED BUT IMMEDIATELY CAME TO BECAUSE OF THE VAST AMOUNT OF WATER IN HIS HAIR WHICH TRICKLING DOWN OVER HIS FACE RESTORED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
THE SPECTERS IN CLASSIC AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE WERE MALARIAL VAPOROUS BEINGS WITHOUT ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING BUT THREATEN
SO THAT A WAITING SPIRIT MIGHT EASILY PASS WELL HE WAS A DOCTOR NOT A MINISTER HIS BUSINESS WAS WITH THE BODY AND HE ORDERED REPAIRS SHE WAS ONLY THIRTY SEVEN
IT WAS PERHAPS MORE OF A TRICKLE THAN A FADE BUT AS A DISAPPEARANCE IT WAS COMPLETE BY SAINT GEORGE AND HIS DRAGON EJACULATED THE MASTER OF HARROWBY WRINGING HIS HANDS
MEDIEVAL AND LATER LITERATURE GAVE US MANY INSTANCES OF A LOVE AFFAIR OR MARRIAGE BETWEEN ONE SPIRIT AND ONE MORTAL
OF THE EARLY SPECIMENS OF THE REALLY AMUSING GHOST THAT IS AN ACTUAL REVENANT IS THE GHOST BABY IN BLACKWOOD'S WHICH SHOWS ORIGINALITY AND HUMOR YET IS TOO DIFFUSE FOR PRINTING HERE
IN APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY JOHN NEWBEGIN DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE LITTLE CEMETERY ON THE LANDWARD SIDE OF THE ISLAND NEWBEGIN WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY EIGHT WITHOUT FAMILY OR NEAR CONNECTIONS AND ECCENTRIC TO A DEGREE
BUT PROCEEDED TO MEET THE CONDITIONS OF HER OWN LIFE BY OPENING A SMALL SHOP IN HER HOME AND WHEN SHE EXHIBITED A WHOLESOME SENSE OF PROFIT AND LOSS
WE ARE PERMITTED TO MAKE EXTRACTS FROM A PRIVATE LETTER WHICH BEARS THE SIGNATURE OF A GENTLEMAN WELL KNOWN IN BUSINESS CIRCLES AND WHOSE VERACITY WE HAVE NEVER HEARD CALLED IN QUESTION HIS STATEMENTS ARE STARTLING AND WELL NIGH INCREDIBLE BUT IF TRUE
A DISTURBING SORT OF FIRE FOR WHICH MISSUS MORRIS WAS RATHER NOTED AND WHICH MADE SOME OF HER MOST LOYAL TOWNSFOLK A BIT SHY OF HER OH I AIN'T REFERRIN TO THE PICTURE SHE HASTENED TO EXPLAIN
DOWN AN THROUGH EVERY EGG IN THAT BASKET
THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SELECTIONS IN THIS VOLUME ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CONTRARY
BUT SHE'LL COME MOST ANY WOMAN'LL
THAT HIS SCHEME WOULD AVAIL HIM NOTHING BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL WATER IN GREAT PLENTY WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND THAT NEXT YEAR WOULD FIND HER REHABILITATED AND AS EXASPERATINGLY SATURATING AS EVER
GREEN STREAKS IN THAT POMPADOUR SO KNOWIN MY MAN I'D TAKE COURAGE AN I'D THINK
AT THIS MOMENT AND WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM ME AS I WRITE A MAN WHO DIED AND WAS BURIED FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHO HAS EXPLOITED THE MYSTERIES BEYOND THE GRAVE WALKS TALKS AND HOLDS INTERVIEWS
THE YEAR NOT BEIN UP IS WHY HE STAYED HOME THIS TRIP HE DIDN'T LIKE TO BE SEEN TRAVERSIN THE SAME OLD HAUNTS WITH ANOTHER TILL IT WAS UP I WOULDN'T WAIT BECAUSE TELL THE TRUTH I WAS AFRAID
OVER SHE TOPPLED AGAIN NO PULSE NOR NOTHIN SAME AS THE DEAD WHILE THE BLONDE TALKED SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HER LOOSELY FALLING LOCKS WHICH SHE TRIED VAINLY TO ENTRAP
BY THE TAIL THIS WAS JOHN NEWBEGIN HIS SUDDEN DEATH AS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED HE DIED FOUR YEARS AGO LAST APRIL
AN EVEN IF HE'D BE TAKEN UP WITH HER HE'D GET
BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
THAT HE WAS A FRAUD HIRED FOR THE OCCASION BY MISTER E BUT THE PEOPLE OF POCOCK WHO LAID HIM OUT DUG HIS GRAVE AND PUT HIM INTO IT FOUR YEARS AGO KNOW THAT JOHN NEWBEGIN HAS COME BACK TO THEM FROM A LAND THEY KNOW NOT OF
OH NO HE'S NOT WITH ME THIS TRIP I JUST RUN DOWN FOR A LARK TO SHOW MY FOLKS MY RING AN THINGS AN LET EM SEE IT'S REALLY SO
THAT IS IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE FLURRIED TESTIMONY OF THE BLONDE WHO IN GOING OVER IT TWO HOURS LATER HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO STOP FOR BREATH
BUT LOOK SHE RAISED HER EYES EXCITEDLY TOWARD THE MANTEL LOOK WHAT'S THAT HE'S WAVIN IT LOOKS OH YES IT IS IT'S OUR WINGS TWO PAIRS
WAS IT ANY WONDER THAT HER FRIENDS EXCHANGED GLANCES WHILE MISSUS MORRIS ENTERTAINED THEM IN SO DROLL A WAY STILL AS TIME PASSED AND SHE NOT ONLY BRIGHTENED IN THE LIGHT OF HER DELUSION
HAD GOT HER BEARINGS AND WHEN SHE REALIZED CLEARLY THAT HER SUPPOSED RIVAL HAD ACTUALLY SHOWN UP IN THE FLESH SHE VISIBLY BRACED UP HER NEIGHBORS UNDERSTOOD THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SHOCK TO BE SUDDENLY CONFRONTED
MANIFESTLY DEATH HAS COMPENSATIONS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION THE MARVEL IS THAT APPARITIONS WERE SO LONG IN REALIZING THEIR POSSIBILITIES IN IMPROVING THEIR ADVANTAGES
THAT IS TO SAY IT'S HIS JURISDICTION
AND HE WAS FORCED TO DENY HIMSELF THAT PLEASURE EVERY TIME HE WOULD MOVE SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIM WITH THE RESULT THAT EVERYTHING SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH GOT A DUCKING IN AN EFFORT TO WARM HIMSELF UP HE APPROACHED THE FIRE
DRINKING WATER IF HE SECRETLY KNEW
AND DIVULGE TO HIM THE AWFUL SECRET OF THE HOUSE DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT ON EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE THAT I DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THAT GUEST CHAMBER
AND HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF RUNNING FOR THE NEXT LEGISLATURE IN CONCLUSION AND NOW MY DEAR I HAVE TOLD YOU THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL I KNOW RESPECTING THIS STRANGE STRANGE CASE YET AFTER ALL WHY SO STRANGE
THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT THIS REGRET IS GENUINE HE HAS DISCARDED HIS ECCENTRIC COSTUME AND DRESSES LIKE A REASONABLE SPIRIT HE HAS NOT TOUCHED LIQUOR SINCE HIS REAPPEARANCE
AND SHE DECLARED HERSELF HAPPY INDEED A CERTAIN INEFFABLE LIGHT SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE IN THE EYES OF THOSE NEWLY IN LOVE CAME TO SHINE FROM THE FACE OF THE WIDOW
BUT OUT OF WHICH SHE HAD COME A WIDOW SHE PROUDLY PASSED IT AROUND AMONG THE FRIENDS WAITING WITH HER AT THE POST OFFICE
OF AN INDIAN CHIEF WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS HOCK A MOCK AND WHO RETIRED AFTER DANCING A HARVEST MOON PAS SEUL AND DECLARING HIMSELF IN VERY EMPHATIC TERMS AS OPPOSED TO THE PRESENT INDIAN POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION
BY THE WAY NEWBEGIN THREATENS TO SUE HODGESON FOR HIS INDIVIDED QUARTER IN EACH OF THESE VESSELS AND THIS INTERESTING CASE THEREFORE BIDS FAIR TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED IN THE COURTS
AS THE FACT THAT IT HAD ONE TIME RAINED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT RAINED OUTSIDE WAS BUT A COINCIDENCE AND SHE WAS SOON SURPRISED TO PERCEIVE ALL QUIET
HE WOULD NOT SOME DAY COME OUT OF HIS HIDING TO MEET HER IT WAS A MUFFLED PLEASURE AND TREMULOUSLY ENTERTAINED AT FIRST
DURING EASTERN CRUISES WILL REMEMBER A LONG LISTLESS FIGURE ASTONISHINGLY ATTIRED IN BLUE ARMY PANTS RUBBER BOOTS LOOSE TOGA MADE OF SOME BRIGHT CHINTZ MATERIAL AND VERY BAD HAT STAGGERING THROUGH
MYSELF ENOUGH TO BEQUEATH IT TO THE YOUNG LADY I SUSPICIONED BUT HUMAN NATURE IS FRAIL AN I CAN'T QUITE DO IT ALTHOUGH DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD LIKE IT AS A SOUVENIR
SAID CRAGGS PUSHING BILLY TOWARDS THEM AS HE SPOKE FAIX AND YE MIGHT HAVE GOT WORSE MUTTERED A VERY OLD MAN BILLY TRAYNOR HAS THE LUCKY HAND HOW IS MY LORD NOW NELLY
BUT GIVE ME THE SENTIMENTS OF A LIVING MAN OR ONE THAT HAS LIVED IN PREFERENCE TO ALL THE IMAGINARY CHARACTERS THAT HAVE EVER ADORNED A STORY
ASSUREDLY OF ALL THIS WELL BRED WELL DRESSED AND WELLBORN COMPANY NOW THRONGING THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE AND THE STREET IN FRONT OF IT THE TONE WAS AS MUCH SARCASM AS SORROW
TO THE FORMER HE GAVE VENT TO ALL HIS SARCASM AND BITTERNESS THEY LIKED IT JUST BECAUSE THEY WOULD N'T CONDESCEND TO IT THEMSELVES TO HIS OWN HE PUT ON THE BULLYING AIR OF ONE WHO SAID
TO A LONG AGONY OF TORTURE DO WRITE TO HIM THEN THE ADDRESS IS GLENCORE CASTLE LEENANE IRELAND WHERE I SUPPOSE I SHALL BE STILL A RESIDENT FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT TO COME
AND GO IN A BODY AND TELL THE COUNTESS YOUR MIND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I PRINCESS THAT SOCIAL CREDIT IS AS GREAT A BUBBLE AS COMMERCIAL WE SHOULD ALL OF US BE BANKRUPTS IF OUR BOOKS WERE SEEN
IT CHEERS ONE TO COME UP OUT OF THOSE DREARY DELLS AND HEAR THE PLEASANT PLASH OF THE SEA SAID HARCOURT AND HIS BRIGHT FACE SHOWED THAT HE FELT THE ENJOYMENT SO IT DOES SIR SAID BILLY AND YET
HER MAJESTY'S ENVOY AT STUTTGARD ONE WHO HAD FORMERLY SERVED IN THE SAME REGIMENT WITH GLENCORE AND HIMSELF BUT WHO LEFT THE ARMY EARLY TO FOLLOW THE CAREER OF DIPLOMACY
FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
TRAVERSING A LONG LOW CORRIDOR THEY REACHED A DOOR AT WHICH HAVING WAITED FOR A SECOND OR TWO TO LISTEN CRAGGS TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED THE ROOM WAS VERY LARGE AND LOFTY AND SEEN IN THE DIM LIGHT OF A SMALL LAMP UPON THE HEARTHSTONE
BUT I DO NOT MEAN TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE POLITENESS
YES YES BUT I REPEAT THAT THIS IS AN INFAMOUS CALUMNY SHE A COUNTESS OF A FAMILY SECOND TO NONE IN ALL ITALY
THE POET WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS SECURING THEIR HEARTIEST APPROVAL NOR WAS BILLY INSENSIBLE TO SUCH FLATTERIES THE IRRITABILE GENUS HAS ITS SOFT SIDE AND CAN ENJOY TO THE UTTERMOST ITS OWN SUCCESSES
OR A WARNING MAYBE TO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LIVING MEN DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT FICTION WHAT HE THOUGHT AND FELT IS TRUER THAN ALL THAT YOU AND I AND A SCORE LIKE US EVER DID OR EVER WILL DO
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE SOME TRAITS OF LIFE IT WAS THE NIGHT LADY GLENCORE RECEIVED AND AS USUAL THE STREET WAS CROWDED WITH EQUIPAGES WHICH SOMEHOW SEEMED TO HAVE GOT INTO INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION
THAT COULD N'T COMPOSE YOU TEN HEXAMETERS IF YE'D PUT THEM ON A HOT GRIDDLE FOR IT AND THERE'S OTHERS THAT WOULD TALK RHYME RATHER THAN RAYSON AND SO WITH THE ARS MEDICATRIX EVERYBODY HAS N'T AN EYE FOR A HECTIC OR AN EAR FOR A COUGH NON CONTIGIT
BUT DEPEND UPON IT HE'S NOT THE MAN WE KNEW HIM HEAVEN KNOWS IF HE EVER WILL BE SO AGAIN THE NIGHT I ARRIVED HERE HE WAS MORE NATURAL MORE LIKE HIMSELF IN FACT THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN SINCE
DID YOU EVER SEE A WAXWORK MODEL OF ANATOMY EVERY NERVE AND SINY OF A NERVE WAS THERE
IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS NEITHER COMMENT NOR IMPATIENCE ON THE CONTRARY THEY SEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE CONVULSIVE THROES OF SOUND AS AN EARNEST OF THE GRAND FLOOD OF MELODY THAT WAS COMING
IT SMACKS OF THE GENTLE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS POOR LAD THERE IS SOMETHING VERY SAD IN HIS CASE YOU NEED NOT HAVE TAKEN SUCH TROUBLE ABOUT ACCOUNTS AND EXPENDITURE OF COURSE WHATEVER YOU HAVE DONE I PERFECTLY APPROVE OF
HE HAS LEFT THREE CARDS UPON ME EACH DULY RETURNED BUT I AM RESOLVED THAT OUR INTER CHANGE OF COURTESIES SHALL PROCEED NO FARTHER I TRUST I HAVE OMITTED NOTHING IN REPLY TO YOUR LAST DESPATCH
THE OTHER WAS COLD CAUTIOUS AND RESERVED WHERE ONE BELIEVED THE OTHER DOUBTED WHERE ONE WAS HOPEFUL THE OTHER HAD NOTHING BUT MISGIVINGS
THAT AS WE READ EVERY CHARACTER TO ELICIT TRUTH TRUTH IN THE WORKING OF HUMAN MOTIVES TRUTH IN PASSION
AND THOUGH THE SEASON IS MIDSUMMER I AM OBLIGED TO DRESS ENTIRELY IN A LIGHT COSTUME OF BUCKSKIN AND TAKE MARSALLA BATHS WHICH REFRESH ME AT LEAST FOR THE WHILE
SAID BILLY WITH A DEGREE OF CONFUSION THAT RAISED A HEARTY LAUGH AT HIS EXPENSE WELL BUT WHERE'S THE SONG EXCLAIMED ANOTHER AY SAID CRAGGS WE ARE FORGETTING THE SONG NOW FOR IT BILLY
ON SPAIN AND A SMALL BOX OF THOSE NEW BLISTERS
THE DARK UNLIGHTED WINDOWS SUGGESTED NO REMARK BUT THEY WHO HAD ENTERED THE COURTYARD WERE STRUCK BY THE GLOOMY ASPECT OF THE VAST BUILDING NOT ONLY THAT THE ENTRANCE AND THE STAIRS WERE IN DARKNESS BUT THE WHOLE SUITE OF ROOMS USUALLY BRILLIANT AS THE DAY
MY ITALIAN DOCTOR IMPLIES THAT IT IS THE PASSING MALADY OF MEN HIGHLY EXCITABLE AND LARGELY ENDOWED WITH MENTAL GIFTS HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE CORRECT IN THIS
JUST AS I SUPPOSE THAT YOU'D SAY THAT A SOLDIER IN THE BLUES OR SOME BIG HULKING CORPORAL IN THE GUARDS IS A FINER MODEL OF THE HUMAN FORM THAN EVER PRAXITELES CHISELLED
HE JUST GIVES YOU SOME TRAITS OF A CHARACTER HE POINTS HIM OUT TO YOU PASSING JUST AS I WOULD TO A MAN GOING ALONG THE STREET
AND TEASING ME WITH APOLOGIES FOR WHAT I DON'T MISS AND EXCUSES ABOUT THINGS THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DISCOVERED WANTING I THINK I SEE WHAT IS PASSING WITHIN HIM HE WANTS TO BE CONFIDENTIAL AND HE DOES N'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
I HAVE ONLY SEEN AN OILSKIN CAP BUT HIS COAT HIS ONE COAT IS A CURIOSITY OF INDUSTRIOUS PATCHWORK AND HIS TROUSERS ARE A PAIR OF OUR OLD OVERALLS THE SAME PATTERN WE WORE AT HOUNSLOW WHEN THE KING REVIEWED US
BUT AS RAPIDLY CONTRADICTED AND THE REPLY GIVEN BY THE PORTER TO ALL DEMANDS QUICKLY REPEATED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH HER LADYSHIP WILL NOT RECEIVE CAN NO ONE EXPLAIN THIS MYSTERY CRIED THE OLD PRINCESS BORINSKY
WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
I USED TO KNOW HIS FATHER INTIMATELY NEVER MIND HIS FATHER
POOR FELLOW HE LOOKS VERY ILL TO DAY HE SAYS THAT HE NEVER SLEPT THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THAT THE LAUDANUM HE TOOK TO INDUCE DROWSINESS ONLY EXCITED AND MADDENED HIM I COUNSELLED A HOT JORUM OF MULLED PORTER BEFORE GETTING INTO BED
AND PROMISES THE SAME CHEERING WEATHER FOR AS MANY MORE GLENCORE DOESN'T FANCY THAT THE BOY'S LESSONS SHOULD BE BROKEN IN UPON AND HINC ISTAE LITTERAE THAT'S CLASSICAL FOR YOU I WISH I COULD SAY WHEN I AM LIKELY TO BEAT MY RETREAT
WHY MAN THE ONE IS AS UNREAL AS THE OTHER THE FELLOW THAT CREATED HIM FASHIONED HIS THOUGHTS AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS
THERE IS A WONDERFUL SAMENESS OVER THE WORLD JUST NOW PRELUDING I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT SOME GREAT OUTBURST OF NATIONALITY FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE JUST AS PERIODS OF PURITANISM SUCCEED INTERVALS OF GROSS LICENTIOUSNESS
I HAVE A FEW WHO COME WHEN I WANT THEM AND GO IN LIKE MANNER THEY TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON FAR BETTER AND MORE TRUTHFULLY THAN PAID EMPLOYEES AND THEY CANNOT TRACE MY INTENTIONS THROUGH MY INQUIRIES AND HASTEN OFF TO RETAIL THEM AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
AND WITH AN APPETITE THAT SHOWED HOW MUCH HE RELISHED IT THIS IS ELEGANT LIVING YE HAVE HERE MISTER CRAGGS SAID BILLY AS HE DRAINED HIS TANKARD OF BEER AND PLACED IT WITH A SIGH ON THE TABLE MANY HAPPY YEARS OF IT TO YE I
AS BILLY FINISHED HIS GROWING PANEGYRIC UPON HIS COUNTRY AND HIMSELF HE BURST OUT IN A JOYOUS LAUGH AND CRIED DID YE EVER HEAR CONCEIT LIKE THAT DID YE EVER EXPECT TO SEE THE DAY
CARBINEER IF THE SAME TO YOU MASTER SAID THE OTHER QUIETLY I NEVER SERVED IN THE INFANTRY
THEY DO NOT AT FIRST BLUSH APPEAR TO DISCHARGE ANY VERY GREAT OR NECESSARY FUNCTION IN LIFE BUT WE MUST BY NO MEANS FROM THAT INFER THEIR INUTILITY NATURALISTS TELL US THAT SEVERAL VARIETIES OF INSECT EXISTENCE WE RASHLY SET DOWN AS MERE ANNOYANCES
AND ALL THAT MADE FOR THE WORLD'S GOOD AND HAPPINESS SHOULD BE SO WANTONLY EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT NO TOUCH OF THE VANISHED HAND SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO THE ONE SOUL NOW LEFT BEHIND WITH WHOM HIS SOUL HAD BEEN FUSED
OF SAVING MEN MAXINEFF CORRECTED WHILE HIS WIFE SMILED AS AT THE RECURRENCE OF A CUSTOMARY WITTICISM AND YOU GAVE THE ORDERS MAX YOU ARE TO BE BLAMED FOR THIS DISPLAY OF ENERGY DON'T SCOLD DEAR IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL THING
NOAKES LOOKED DOUBTFUL SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND TURNED AGAIN OH I ALMOST FORGOT HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU WHERE IT CAME IN THE MAXINEFFS MAIL THIS MORNING MISSUS MAX SUGGESTED MY BRINGING IT TO YOU
THIS NEW THING WILL MAKE WAR TOO DREADFUL A COURSE FOR THE LEAST HUMANITARIAN NATION TO PURSUE THAT THE VARIANCE OF NATIONS TENDS TOWARD EQUILIBRIUM IS INCONTROVERTIBLE GRANTED THEN NOAKES WAS PRACTICAL HE PLACED BEFORE HIMSELF A DEFINITE GOAL
WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR I'M BLOWN TO PIECES I DROVE CORNISH THIS MORNING HE GOT BY EVERYTHING ON THE WAY HE ACTED LIKE A PREMIERE DANSEUSE WHEN I PASSED THE COOPER'S SHOP HIS JOY AT SEEING HER WAS DISCOUNTENANCED BY HIS FEAR FOR HER
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED AFRESH BY THE FORCEFUL EXTERIOR SIGNIFICANT OF THE INNER ATTITUDE WHICH HAD WON FOR HENRY MAXINEFF A NAME HONORED AMONG NATIONS WHAT OF YOUR WORK HE SAID NOAKES WAS GLAD THOSE SEEING EYES WERE NOT ON HIM
EVERY NIGHT HE RANG HER UP AND THEY HAD A LONG CONVERSATION MANY TIMES IN THE DAY ALSO NOTHING AS IT HAPPENED COULD HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE BUT THIS MODERN DEVICE LIGHTENED HIS LAST WEEKS HIS DEATH
THERE WAS NO CONDENSING POSSIBLE ONE MUST EITHER EACH TIME HAVE EVERY CONVERSATION OR STOP IT BUT HOW COULD SHE STOP IT BEFORE THE END LOCKING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE HEAVY CURTAIN
A PROFOUND PITY FOR HIMSELF STIRRED HIM NEVER HAD HE SO FELT THE NEED OF HUMANITY OF HUMAN AID HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE WALKING UP MAIN STREET WITH THE BOYS CALLING TO HIM FROM ROONEY'S CIGAR STORE
WHAT'LL I DO WITH MY SUIT CASE GIMME IT TO TAKE FOR YOU I GUESS IT AIN'T WORTH MORE'N MY HORSE
JUST WAIT TILL I STRIKE BROADWAY AND WATCH ME WITH THE GIRLS FOR I'M THE MAN THAT INVENTED IT THE HAIR THAT ALWAYS CURLS HIS HARSH VOICE IN THE STILLNESS WAS RIDICULOUS EVEN TO HIM BUT WHEN HE STOPPED SINGING
AND IN A PANIC MADDER THAN HIS RIDER'S BREAK INTO A RUN AND DASH UNRESTRAINABLY ONWARD CARGAN NUMB WITH FRIGHT LEANED OVER HIS NECK AND WOUND HIS HANDS IN THE MANE THE SPEED SICKENED HIM THE FLAT EARTH SWUNG BENEATH
TO WAKE TO WHAT TO SUCH AWAKENING AS THERE IS FOR THOSE WHO NEVER FORGET ANYTHING
I FORGOT TO HAVE LUNCHEON TO DAY AND YOUR TEA HAS GIVEN ME A KEEN ANTICIPATION FOR DINNER MY ZEST WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO YOU AND PAST MY CONTROL BESIDES I SHALL TAKE A HALF MILE WALK TO NIGHT LUCKY BECKY THEN COME AGAIN SOON MAX DEAR SHE SAID
GOOD MORNING MISTER MAXINEFF SAID NOAKES TURNING SLOWLY THE RACKET SOME HALF BAKED FULMINATE I PUT IN THE DITCH OUT THERE AN HOUR AGO SO LONG SINCE SAID THE OLDER MAN ADVANCING TOWARD THE WINDOW
HE WOULD INCREASE THE CURRENT THE THOUGHT BURNED BEFORE HIM LIKE A LIVE THING AND IN THE LIGHT OF IT HE SAW MANY PICTURES HELIOGRAPHS OF HAPPENINGS IN AND ABOUT THE LABORATORIES FLAME SMOKE DENSE AND TURGID
AS SHE LISTENED THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE BUT STILL SHE TURNED ON AND ON SOMETIMES HE WAS SO HOPEFUL AND BRIGHT AND AGAIN SO DESPAIRING
FILLED A SECOND CRUCIBLE WITH A HARMLESS HAPHAZARD MIXTURE AND PLACED IT OVER A DEAD FURNACE IN A STAND IN THE CORNER BEHIND THE DOOR HE LIFTED THE WINDOW SASH WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE HURLED HIS PRICELESS CRUCIBLE
TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I CANNOT HEAR THAT AGAIN I SHALL BE ON THE PORCH WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH THE WINDOW NOAKES SEATED HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO A NEW EXPOSITION OF THE SUBJECT WHICH CHIEFLY AROUSED MAXINEFF'S INTEREST AND LOOSED HIS SPEECH
MISSUS MAXINEFF LIFTED HER SHOULDERS AND DISPLAYED HER PALMS IN A MANNER THAT MARKED HER NATIONALITY SO SCIENCE HAS MADE YOUR DARK SKIN WHITE LOVE FOR THIS BUSINESS OF KILLING MEN HAS KEPT YOU HID A WEEK
THAT SHE WOULD UNHESITATINGLY BRUSH OUT OF HER LIFE PATH THE DUST OF DOUBT THAT EQUIVOCATION AND WILLINGNESS TO BALANCE MOTIVES WERE NO PART OF HER HE KNEW THAT IN HER WERE NO DIM ANGLES OF CROSS GRAINED PURPOSE
THEY HELPED HIM ON AND POINTED OUT THE DIM LINE OF TELEPHONE POLES WHICH MARKED A ROAD A MILE BEYOND
HELLO JIMMY GIVE ME A KISS DEAR AND TAKE YOUR OLD SHIRT SHE WAS A GRACEFUL WOMAN STIFFENED BY AN OBVIOUS CORSET AND FAINTLY POWDERED A LONG YELLOW FEATHER DANGLED FROM HER ORANGE HAT BIG PEARLS WERE SET IN HER EARS AND HER SHOE BUCKLES GLITTERED AS SHE WALKED
HIS HUMILITY SEEMED REAL AND PERHAPS THE UNUSUALNESS OF IT BROUGHT A CURIOUS EXPRESSION TO MAXINEFF'S FACE AND INTO HIS EYES A CONTEMPLATIVE LIGHT THAT NOAKES DID NOT CARE TO MEET I MET MISS HALLAM AS I ENTERED MAXINEFF SAID CARELESSLY
THE ASSERTION IN HIS TONE WAS IRRITATING WHAT'S GOIN TO STOP US CARGAN ASKED COOLLY SHOVED HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND PUFFED CLOUDS FROM HIS CIGAR DIFFERENT WORLDS OF IMAGINATION REVOLVED IN THE TWO MEN'S MINDS
TELL ME SOME MORE ABOUT YOUR INVENTIVE FRIEND IS HE WEALTHY INDEED NO SAID THE ENGINEER THAT IS HIS TROUBLE IF HE HAD MORE MONEY OR IF HE HAD SOME RICH BACKERS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM HE MIGHT DO WONDERS I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP HIM SHE SAID
AND A CURIOUS NEW SENSE OF THE BIGNESS OF THE EARTH OPPRESSED HIM HE FELT VERY SMALL AND VERY MEAN THE HUMILIATION OF HIS SPIRITS WAS A NOVEL FEELING AND AN UNPLEASANT ONE HE TRIED TO HUM IT AWAY
WHAT'LL I DO CARGAN THEY TOLD ME I'D FIND YOU ON THE TRAIN AND I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOUR ADVICE CARGAN WAS RELIEVED SELL MISTER WALDRON HE ANSWERED EARNESTLY SELL RIGHT OFF THAT BROGAN CROWD'S RUNNIN THE COMPANY NOW
HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF WALDRON PACING SOMEWHERE LIKE HIMSELF ALONE LOST HELPLESS HIS PRIDE GONE IN HIS AWAKENED IMAGINATION HE SAW HIM WANDERING NEARER AND NEARER THE FATAL ACT
THE NEED FOR SUCH CONTRIVANCES WAS NOT ACUTE AND SO ON THE CONVERSATION THUS BEGUN REACHED AT LAST SPECIFIC INVENTIONS AND THE ENGINEER TOLD OF A REMARKABLE ONE WHICH HAD COME UNDER HIS NOTICE JUST BEFORE HE LEFT NEW YORK
BY A MARVEL OF SPEED HE HAD THE SASH LOWERED AND WAS BEHIND THE DOOR WHEN THE BUILDING WAS SHAKEN BY AN EXPLOSION WHAT IS THAT MISTER NOAKES CAME IN DEEP CALM TONES FROM THE DOOR
SO TIRED SO OLD IT IS A BAD DAY EVERY ONE HAS BEEN COMPLAINING OF TIREDNESS TO DAY YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE KIND JUST TO COMFORT ME IT'S NO USE I CAN SEE SO CLEARLY SOMETIMES
OUTSIDE CARGAN HEARD A BURST OF MERRY VOICES AND SAW WALDRON HURRIED AWAY BY TWO LAUGHING GIRLS TO AN AUTOMOBILE WAITING WITH A TRUNK STRAPPED BEHIND IT MISSUS WALDRON FOLLOWED SHE WAS A STIFF WOMAN A LITTLE FADED QUIETLY DRESSED
HE ASSUMED A TOTTERING BRAVADO AND AS HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE LEVER HE SMILED CROOKEDLY A LIGHT QUICK TREAD SOUNDED ON THE WALK OUTSIDE ON THE DOUBLE STEP AS THE KNOB TURNED A VOICE SAID
HOW DISTINCTLY YOU SPEAK YES IT'S ME AND THE SOFT VIBRANT LAUGH
IT WOULD BECOME IMBUED WITH MARVELOUS POSSIBILITY A THING FOR WHICH ROYAL MILITARY BUREAUS IMPERIAL NAVIES WOULD PAY A GREAT PRICE A TWIST OF THE LEVER WOULD DO IT YET HOW ALIKE AND EWELL WAS MAD
AND CAGLIOSTRO WHEN THE PUZZLE'S SOLVED COME TO SEE ME I'LL SING AWAY THE WORRIES GOOD BYE GOOD BYE MISS BECKY EXCUSE MY UNTRACTABLENESS WON'T YOU WITH A PAT TO HER HAT AND A SMILE TO NOAKES SHE WAS GONE
THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GALLING AND THE MADNESS OF GRATIFICATION CONSUMED HIS STRENGTH HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR STEPPING VERY GENTLY FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW SLIGHT A VIBRATION MIGHT SHATTER THE DELICATE AFFINITY IN HIS DISCOVERY
THAT HE CAN DEVISE SOME MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF REVERSING AT THE TIME WHICH WILL MAKE THE MESSAGES READ FORWARD AS THEY SHOULD JUST THINK OF THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DETECTIVE LISTENING THROUGH ALL THE VOICES AND ORDINARY CONVERSATIONS ON THE WIRE
WHEN HE SAT DOWN IN THE DINER FOR HIS MORNING MEAL THE GREAT WHEEL OF THE HORIZON RIMMED ROUND HIS LITTLE TRAIN WITHOUT A NOTCH ON THE PERFECT CIRCLE OVER NIGHT THE OUTER WORLD HAD CHANGED BUT HE WAS ABSORBED IN FITTING HIS CHOICES INTO A SIXTY CENT BREAKFAST
THERE WAS NO HOUSE IN SIGHT NO ROAD NOTHING BUT THE DEAD TRAIN THE NEW LAND OF ENDLESS SHIMMERING PRAIRIES AND BEYOND THE DITCH A SINGLE HORSEMAN LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE LONG CARS AND THE FACES STRAINED AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE WINDOWS
CARGAN CAREFULLY CONCEALING HIS TORN TROUSERS CLIMBED A STOOL AND BEGAN TO LOOK BACK UPON THE VAGARIES OF THE DAY WITH SULLEN WONDER HE BRUSHED FURTIVELY AT THE CAKED DUST ON HIS LEGS REMEMBERING IRRITABLY THE ELEGANCE OF WALDRON WHOM HE HAD SAVED
SHE HAD LEARNED NOW WHEN NOT TO LISTEN SHE HAD TIMED THE REPRODUCTION ABSOLUTELY AND WATCH IN HAND SHE WAITED UNTIL THE OTHER MESSAGES WERE DONE
HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
NOW RECALL OUR DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL BODILY STIMULI AS DISTURBERS OF SLEEP OR AS DREAM PRODUCERS WE LEARNED DEFINITE FACTS ABOUT THIS
I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
OR THINKS OF ONLY WITH ABHORRENCE THESE CENSORED WISHES WHICH HAVE ATTAINED TO A DISTORTED EXPRESSION IN THE DREAM ARE ABOVE ALL EXPRESSIONS OF A BOUNDLESS RECKLESS EGOISM AND INDEED THE PERSONAL EGO OCCURS IN EVERY DREAM TO PLAY THE MAJOR PART IN EACH OF THEM
WITHOUT CALLING AND PETTING IT THE MOUSE OF WHICH WOMEN ARE SO MUCH AFRAID IS AT THE SAME TIME A FIRST CLASS PET NAME MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN GRATIFIED TO HAVE HER LOVER CALL HER SO SCREAMS WHEN SHE SEES THE CUNNING LITTLE CREATURE ITSELF
A CERTAIN DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MANIFEST DREAM CONTENT AND LATENT DREAM THOUGHT EVEN IN THESE DREAMS FOUR THE CHILD'S DREAM IS A REACTION TO AN EXPERIENCE OF THE DAY
THEY SOUND LIKE THE ENUMERATION OF THE TEN EGYPTIAN PLAGUES EXCEPT THAT THEIR NUMBER EXCEEDS TEN BY FAR JUST LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS WHICH MAY BECOME THE OBJECTS OF CONTENTS OF A PHOBIA DARKNESS OPEN AIR
THINK OF THE AMOUNT OF BRUTALITY THE CRUELTY AND THE LIES ALLOWED TO SPREAD OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT A HANDFUL OF CONSCIENCELESS EGOISTS AND CORRUPTIONISTS COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SETTING FREE ALL THESE EVIL SPIRITS
I MUST SAY THAT I KNOW OF NOTHING MORE INDIFFERENT TO ME FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPREHENSION OF FEAR THAN KNOWLEDGE OF THE NERVE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH THESE SENSATIONS MUST PASS ONE CAN TALK ABOUT FEAR FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING UPON NERVOUSNESS
WE DEEM IT QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SAVAGE FEARS A CANNON OR AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHILE THE WHITE MAN
TWO WE SEE THAT CHILDREN'S DREAMS ARE NOT MEANINGLESS THEY ARE INTELLIGIBLE SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIC ACTS YOU WILL RECALL WHAT I REPRESENTED TO YOU AS THE MEDICAL OPINION CONCERNING THE DREAM
HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE TO US THE DOMINANCE OF THE OPPOSITE TENDENCY THIS FACT MUST FINALLY DISCONCERT US IS IT NOT TIME TO LAY ASIDE THE WHOLE WORK OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION AS SOMETHING WHOSE RESULTS REDUCE IT TO ABSURDITY BY NO MEANS
OR POSSIBLY EVEN ATTACK UNDER SUCH A PROCEEDING FEAR HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WOULD BE CONSUMMATED JUST AS WELL AND BETTER WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEAR YOU KNOW THAT IF FEAR IS TOO STRONG
WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO ATTRIBUTE THE MORE NORMAL AND DEEPER SLEEP TO THE CHILD THREE DREAM DISTORTION IS LACKING IN THESE DREAMS THEREFORE THEY NEED NO INTERPRETATION THE MANIFEST AND LATENT DREAMS ARE MERGED
AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
WE NEED NOT GIVE UP THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH OUR LABORS IN DREAM INTERPRETATION LEAD US EVEN THOUGH WE MUST CONSIDER THOSE CONCLUSIONS STRANGE PERHAPS WE CAN APPROACH THEIR UNDERSTANDING LATER BY ANOTHER PATH FOR THE PRESENT LET US REPEAT
EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
BUT A GUARDIAN OF SLEEP WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO QUELL DISTURBANCES IT IS TRUE WE THINK WE WOULD HAVE SLEPT BETTER IF WE HAD NOT DREAMT BUT HERE WE ARE WRONG AS A MATTER OF FACT WE WOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT AT ALL WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE DREAM
SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
THE EMOTIONAL CONDITION HAS A STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN HYSTERICAL ATTACK IT IS THE UPSHOT OF A REMINISCENCE THE HYSTERIC ATTACK THEN IS COMPARABLE TO A NEWLY FORMED INDIVIDUAL EMOTION
AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
OF REPROACHING IT WITH DENYING ONE THING BECAUSE IT WAS ASSERTING ANOTHER IT IS NOT OUR INTENTION TO DENY THE NOBLE STRIVINGS OF HUMAN NATURE NOR HAVE WE EVER DONE ANYTHING TO DEPRECATE THEIR VALUE ON THE CONTRARY I SHOW YOU NOT ONLY THE CENSORED EVIL DREAM WISHES
YET IT IS JUST THIS TYPE THAT I CAN DEMONSTRATE BY THE ONLY DREAM EXAMPLE WHICH WE HAVE SO FAR ANALYZED YOU WILL REMEMBER THE DREAM OF THE THREE BAD THEATRE TICKETS FOR ONE FLORIN AND A HALF
DREAM DISTORTION MAKES ITS APPEARANCE VERY EARLY IN CHILDHOOD AND DREAMS OF CHILDREN FROM FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE HAVE BEEN RECORDED THAT SHOWED ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LATER DREAMS
CLINICAL OBSERVATION YIELDS SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF NEUROTIC FEAR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH I SHALL DISCUSS WITH YOU ONE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THAT EXPECTANT FEAR OR GENERAL ANXIETY
WE BLAME THEM FOR BEING OVER ANXIOUS OR PESSIMISTIC A STRIKING AMOUNT OF EXPECTANT FEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A NERVOUS CONDITION WHICH I HAVE NAMED ANXIETY NEUROSIS AND WHICH I GROUP WITH THE TRUE NEUROSES
THE INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROTIC FEAR OF CERTAIN PHASES OF LIFE SUCH AS PUBERTY AND THE PERIOD OF MENOPAUSE WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF LIBIDO IS MATERIALLY HEIGHTENED BELONGS HERE TOO IN SOME CONDITIONS OF EXCITEMENT WE MAY OBSERVE THE MIXTURE OF ANXIETY AND LIBIDO
BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
FROM HIS HOME IN AUSSEE THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE DACHSTEIN
THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
AFTER THESE REMARKS CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF THE DREAM CENSOR LET US NOW TURN TO THEIR DYNAMICS I HOPE YOU WILL NOT CONSIDER THE EXPRESSION TOO ANTHROPOMORPHICALLY AND PICTURE THE DREAM CENSOR AS A SEVERE LITTLE MANIKIN WHO LIVES IN A LITTLE BRAIN CHAMBER AND THERE PERFORMS HIS DUTIES
I DO NOT CLAIM THAT I CAN FURNISH YOU WITH THIS COMPLETE SOLUTION BUT YOU WILL CERTAINLY EXPECT PSYCHOANALYSIS TO DEAL WITH THIS THEME IN A MANNER DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE
BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISPOSITION TO DENY THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE AND TO SET FORTH THE IDEAL DEMANDED BY SOCIETY AS A FULFILLED THING MUCH OFTENER THAN IT REALLY IS FULFILLED BUT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
WHICH WAS AT THE TIME A CONSEQUENCE OF AN ACTUAL SITUATION AND IS HENCEFORTH REPEATED ALMOST REGULARLY IN THE EMOTION WE SHALL ALSO RECOGNIZE HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS THAT THIS FIRST CONDITION OF FEAR APPEARED DURING THE SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER
THE CHILD HAD TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO SEE IT THROUGH THE TELESCOPE WITH WHAT RESULT NO ONE KNEW HE STARTED ON THE EXCURSION IN A JOYOUSLY EXPECTANT MOOD WHENEVER A NEW MOUNTAIN CAME IN SIGHT THE BOY ASKED
CAN BE RESOLVED INTO ITS COMPONENTS THE WHOLE ATTACK MAY BE REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE INTENSIVELY DEVELOPED SYMPTOM SUCH AS A TREMBLING DIZZINESS PALPITATION OF THE HEART OR TIGHTENING OF BREATH
AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
OF COURSE WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE TENDENCY TO REPETITION OF THE FIRST CONDITION OF FEAR HAS BEEN SO DEEPLY INGRAINED IN THE ORGANISM THROUGH COUNTLESS GENERATIONS THAT NOT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN ESCAPE THE EMOTION OF FEAR
