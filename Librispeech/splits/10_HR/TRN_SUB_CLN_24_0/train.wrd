NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN MY BROTHER NO READ IT YOURSELF CRIED CATHERINE WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE CLEARER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE HAD BLUSHED BEFORE
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
HIS MARRYING MISS THORPE IS NOT PROBABLE I THINK YOU MUST BE DECEIVED SO FAR I AM VERY SORRY FOR MISTER MORLAND SORRY THAT ANYONE YOU LOVE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY BUT MY SURPRISE WOULD BE GREATER
BUT PERHAPS OBSERVED CATHERINE THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR FAMILY SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN SHE LIKES SHE MAY BE CONSTANT
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
INCONCEIVABLE HENRY FREDERICK TOO WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO PROUDLY
I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN MY LIFE BEFORE AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT BUT AS FOR POOR JAMES
AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
YOU WOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE ON WHOSE REGARD YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE OR WHOSE COUNSEL
I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER AND HAVING READ IT THROUGH WITH CLOSE ATTENTION RETURNED IT SAYING WELL IF IT IS TO BE SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
WHAT WAS HER FATHER A LAWYER I BELIEVE THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY NO NOT VERY I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL BUT THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY
HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
AT CATHERINE'S INVITATION NOW READ THE LETTER LIKEWISE AND HAVING EXPRESSED ALSO HER CONCERN AND SURPRISE BEGAN TO INQUIRE INTO MISS THORPE'S CONNECTIONS AND FORTUNE HER MOTHER IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF WOMAN WAS CATHERINE'S ANSWER
NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND SOMETHING IN WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED PASSED HIS LIPS HOW QUICK YOU ARE CRIED CATHERINE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT I DECLARE AND YET WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH
AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
YOU LOSE HALF YOURSELF YOU FEEL A VOID IN YOUR HEART WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN OCCUPY SOCIETY IS BECOMING IRKSOME AND AS FOR THE AMUSEMENTS IN WHICH YOU WERE WONT TO SHARE AT BATH THE VERY IDEA OF THEM WITHOUT HER IS ABHORRENT
I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
ARTLESS GUILELESS WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE FORMING NO PRETENSIONS AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE SUCH A SISTER IN LAW HENRY I SHOULD DELIGHT IN SAID ELEANOR WITH A SMILE
FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
INDEED I AM AFRAID SHE WILL REPLIED HENRY I AM AFRAID SHE WILL BE VERY CONSTANT UNLESS A BARONET SHOULD COME IN HER WAY THAT IS FREDERICK'S ONLY CHANCE I WILL GET THE BATH PAPER AND LOOK OVER THE ARRIVALS
YOU LITTLE THOUGHT OF ITS ENDING SO ISABELLA NO WONDER NOW I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER ISABELLA HAS DESERTED MY BROTHER AND IS TO MARRY YOURS COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN SUCH INCONSTANCY AND FICKLENESS
INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE WORLD I HOPE SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER YOU ARE MISINFORMED I HOPE HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MISTER MORLAND'S DISAPPOINTMENT
THERE ARE THREE TALL TREES SAID HE ABOUT IN THE RIGHT LINE FROM SKELETON ISLAND SPY GLASS SHOULDER I TAKE IT
BUT THIS TIME FOLLOWING THE ADVICE HAL BROKE OUT THE RUNNERS WHICH HAD BEEN FROZEN TO THE SNOW THE OVERLOADED AND UNWIELDY SLED FORGED AHEAD BUCK AND HIS MATES STRUGGLING FRANTICALLY UNDER THE RAIN OF BLOWS A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD THE PATH TURNED
SHE ATTACKED THE BELONGINGS OF HER MEN AND WENT THROUGH THEM LIKE A TORNADO THIS ACCOMPLISHED THE OUTFIT THOUGH CUT IN HALF WAS STILL A FORMIDABLE BULK CHARLES AND HAL WENT OUT IN THE EVENING AND BOUGHT SIX OUTSIDE DOGS
HE WAS A SEAMAN SAID GEORGE MERRY WHO BOLDER THAN THE REST HAD GONE UP CLOSE AND WAS EXAMINING THE RAGS OF CLOTHING LEASTWAYS THIS IS GOOD SEA CLOTH AYE AYE SAID SILVER LIKE ENOUGH
IN HIS LIFETIME OF DECEIT HAD OFTEN SUCCESSFULLY FEIGNED A HURT LEG WAS NOW LIMPING IN EARNEST SOL LEKS WAS LIMPING AND DUB WAS SUFFERING FROM A WRENCHED SHOULDER BLADE THEY WERE ALL TERRIBLY FOOTSORE
AND WHAT WITH WASTED FOOD AND SLEEPING SENTRIES THOUGH THEY WERE BOLD ENOUGH FOR A BRUSH AND BE DONE WITH IT I COULD SEE THEIR ENTIRE UNFITNESS FOR ANYTHING LIKE A PROLONGED CAMPAIGN EVEN SILVER
BLANKETS FOR A HOTEL QUOTH ONE OF THE MEN WHO LAUGHED AND HELPED HALF AS MANY IS TOO MUCH GET RID OF THEM THROW AWAY THAT TENT AND ALL THOSE DISHES
JIM THAT'S ONE TO YOU THIS IS THE FIRST GLINT OF HOPE I HAD SINCE THE ATTACK FAILED
WHEN DID EVER A GENTLEMAN O FORTUNE SHOW HIS STERN TO THAT MUCH DOLLARS FOR A BOOZY OLD SEAMAN WITH A BLUE MUG AND HIM DEAD TOO BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF REAWAKENING COURAGE IN HIS FOLLOWERS
BIT OF IT EVERY MUSCLE EVERY FIBRE EVERY CELL WAS TIRED DEAD TIRED AND THERE WAS REASON FOR IT IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES
THERE WAS NO POWER OF RECUPERATION LEFT NO RESERVE STRENGTH TO CALL UPON
THE CAPSIZED SLED GROUND OVER HIM AND THE DOGS DASHED ON UP THE STREET
AND OFF TO SEA LIKE JOLLY COMPANIONS WHY THEN WE'LL TALK MISTER HAWKINS OVER WE WILL AND WE'LL GIVE HIM HIS SHARE TO BE SURE FOR ALL HIS KINDNESS
BUCK HEARD THE CHAFFERING SAW THE MONEY PASS BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENT AND KNEW THAT THE SCOTCH HALF BREED AND THE MAIL TRAIN DRIVERS WERE PASSING OUT OF HIS LIFE ON THE HEELS OF PERRAULT AND FRANCOIS AND THE OTHERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
THE TENT WAS ROLLED INTO AN AWKWARD BUNDLE THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TIN DISHES WERE PACKED AWAY UNWASHED MERCEDES CONTINUALLY FLUTTERED IN THE WAY OF HER MEN AND KEPT UP AN UNBROKEN CHATTERING OF REMONSTRANCE AND ADVICE
WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
ERE WE WERE HALF WAY OVER LONG JOHN ALONE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND BIDDING THEM WAIT TILL THEY WERE THERE WE PULLED EASILY BY SILVER'S DIRECTIONS NOT TO WEARY THE HANDS PREMATURELY AND AFTER QUITE A LONG PASSAGE
COULD ONLY BE DECIDED ON THE SPOT
IT'S SPRINGTIME AND YOU WON'T GET ANY MORE COLD WEATHER THE MAN REPLIED SHE SHOOK HER HEAD DECIDEDLY
AND THE FOREMOST BROKE INTO A RUN AND SUDDENLY NOT TEN YARDS FURTHER WE BEHELD THEM STOP A LOW CRY AROSE SILVER DOUBLED HIS PACE DIGGING AWAY WITH THE FOOT OF HIS CRUTCH LIKE ONE POSSESSED AND NEXT MOMENT HE AND I HAD COME ALSO TO A DEAD HALT
OF SOME AMBIGUITY THEY RAN THE READER MAY REMEMBER THUS TALL TREE SPY GLASS SHOULDER BEARING A POINT TO THE N OF N N E SKELETON ISLAND
BUCK'S ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS HAD DWINDLED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THE REST OF HIS MATES THOUGH LIGHTER DOGS HAD RELATIVELY LOST MORE WEIGHT THAN HE PIKE THE MALINGERER WHO
CHAPTER FIVE THE TOIL OF TRACE AND TRAIL THIRTY DAYS FROM THE TIME IT LEFT DAWSON THE SALT WATER MAIL WITH BUCK AND HIS MATES AT THE FORE ARRIVED AT SKAGUAY THEY WERE IN A WRETCHED STATE WORN OUT AND WORN DOWN
BUT SHE WAS A CLANNISH CREATURE AND RUSHED AT ONCE TO THE DEFENCE OF HER BROTHER NEVER MIND THAT MAN SHE SAID POINTEDLY
THE DOGS NEVER STOPPED THE LIGHTENED SLED BOUNDED ON ITS SIDE BEHIND THEM THEY WERE ANGRY BECAUSE OF THE ILL TREATMENT THEY HAD RECEIVED AND THE UNJUST LOAD BUCK WAS RAGING HE BROKE INTO A RUN THE TEAM FOLLOWING HIS LEAD
DEARS SHE CRIED SYMPATHETICALLY WHY DON'T YOU PULL HARD THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE WHIPPED BUCK DID NOT LIKE HER BUT HE WAS FEELING TOO MISERABLE TO RESIST HER TAKING IT AS PART OF THE DAY'S MISERABLE WORK
OR HARDER STILL TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTOR'S LAST WARNING TO SILVER LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN YOU FIND IT AND YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE TASTE I FOUND IN MY BREAKFAST AND WITH HOW UNEASY A HEART I SET FORTH BEHIND MY CAPTORS
AND IT WAS NOW GROWN SO HOT THAT THEY COULD ONLY APPROACH IT FROM THE WINDWARD AND EVEN THERE NOT WITHOUT PRECAUTION IN THE SAME WASTEFUL SPIRIT THEY HAD COOKED I SUPPOSE THREE TIMES MORE THAN WE COULD EAT AND ONE OF THEM WITH AN EMPTY LAUGH
BUT IT'S OVER AND DONE I'LL TAKE HIM IN A LINE WHEN WE GO TREASURE HUNTING FOR WE'LL KEEP HIM LIKE SO MUCH GOLD IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS YOU MARK AND IN THE MEANTIME ONCE WE GOT THE SHIP AND TREASURE BOTH
NOT FOR A DOZEN CHARLESES SHE APPEALED TO EVERYBODY AND TO EVERYTHING FINALLY WIPING HER EYES AND PROCEEDING TO CAST OUT EVEN ARTICLES OF APPAREL THAT WERE IMPERATIVE NECESSARIES AND IN HER ZEAL WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED WITH HER OWN
IT WAS CONSPICUOUS FAR TO SEA BOTH ON THE EAST AND WEST AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENTERED AS A SAILING MARK UPON THE CHART BUT IT WAS NOT ITS SIZE THAT NOW IMPRESSED MY COMPANIONS
DIS IS DE LAS DEN WE GET ONE LONG RES EH FOR SURE ONE BULLY LONG RES THE DRIVERS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED A LONG STOPOVER THEMSELVES
WE'LL HAVE TO JUMP ABOUT AND FIND OUT AND THEN MATES US THAT HAS THE BOATS I RECKON HAS THE UPPER HAND THUS HE KEPT RUNNING ON WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF THE HOT BACON THUS HE RESTORED THEIR HOPE AND CONFIDENCE AND
EATING AWAY WITH CAPTAIN FLINT UPON HIS SHOULDER HAD NOT A WORD OF BLAME FOR THEIR RECKLESSNESS AND THIS THE MORE SURPRISED ME FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SHOWN HIMSELF SO CUNNING AS HE DID THEN
ADJOINING ON THE NORTH THE SLOPING SOUTHERN SHOULDER OF THE SPY GLASS AND
WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE TO THEIR TASTE A SAILOR IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD SHOT AND BESIDES ALL THAT WHEN THEY WERE SO SHORT OF EATABLES IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD BE VERY FLUSH OF POWDER WELL THUS EQUIPPED WE ALL SET OUT EVEN THE FELLOW WITH THE BROKEN HEAD
CHARLES TURNED HIS BACK AND DREW THE LASHINGS DOWN AS WELL AS HE COULD WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST WELL AN OF COURSE THE DOGS CAN HIKE ALONG ALL DAY WITH THAT CONTRAPTION BEHIND THEM AFFIRMED A SECOND OF THE MEN CERTAINLY
I SAW HIM DEAD WITH THESE HERE DEADLIGHTS SAID MORGAN BILLY TOOK ME IN THERE HE LAID WITH
NO SPRING OR REBOUND WAS LEFT IN THEM THEIR FEET FELL HEAVILY ON THE TRAIL JARRING THEIR BODIES AND DOUBLING THE FATIGUE OF A DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH THEM EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE DEAD TIRED
WHEN DRIVEN WITH HIS MATES TO THE NEW OWNERS CAMP BUCK SAW A SLIPSHOD AND SLOVENLY AFFAIR TENT HALF STRETCHED DISHES UNWASHED EVERYTHING IN DISORDER ALSO HE SAW A WOMAN MERCEDES THE MEN CALLED HER
IT'S CHILD'S PLAY TO FIND THE STUFF NOW I'VE HALF A MIND TO DINE FIRST I DON'T FEEL SHARP GROWLED MORGAN THINKIN O FLINT I THINK IT WERE AS DONE ME
BEN GUNN'S NOT HERE IN THE BODY ANY MORE'N FLINT BUT THE OLDER HANDS GREETED THIS REMARK WITH SCORN WHY NOBODY MINDS BEN GUNN CRIED MERRY DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDS HIM
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
MINGLED THEIR SPICE WITH THE AROMA OF THE OTHERS THE AIR BESIDES WAS FRESH AND STIRRING AND THIS UNDER THE SHEER SUNBEAMS WAS A WONDERFUL REFRESHMENT TO OUR SENSES
GIVING THE LIE TO THE LIMPLY DROOPING LIP IT CONCEALED HAL WAS A YOUNGSTER OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WITH A BIG COLT'S REVOLVER AND A HUNTING KNIFE STRAPPED ABOUT HIM ON A BELT THAT FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH CARTRIDGES THIS BELT WAS THE MOST SALIENT THING ABOUT HIM
SAID HE IT'S LUCKY YOU HAVE BARBECUE TO THINK FOR YOU WITH THIS HERE HEAD I GOT WHAT I WANTED I DID SURE ENOUGH THEY HAVE THE SHIP WHERE THEY HAVE IT I DON'T KNOW YET BUT ONCE WE HIT THE TREASURE
AND HE DON'T WALK THAT I KNOW LEASTWAYS HE WON'T WALK BY DAY AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT CARE KILLED A CAT FETCH AHEAD FOR THE DOUBLOONS
THE TREASURE HUNT FLINT'S POINTER JIM SAID SILVER WHEN WE WERE ALONE IF I SAVED YOUR LIFE YOU SAVED MINE AND I'LL NOT FORGET IT I SEEN THE DOCTOR WAVING YOU TO RUN FOR IT WITH THE TAIL OF MY EYE I DID
THE FIRST OF THE TALL TREES WAS REACHED AND BY THE BEARINGS PROVED THE WRONG ONE SO WITH THE SECOND THE THIRD ROSE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR ABOVE A CLUMP OF UNDERWOOD A GIANT OF A VEGETABLE WITH A RED COLUMN AS BIG AS A COTTAGE
MUST STICK CLOSE BACK TO BACK LIKE
THREE MEN FROM A NEIGHBORING TENT CAME OUT AND LOOKED ON GRINNING AND WINKING AT ONE ANOTHER YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT SMART LOAD AS IT IS SAID ONE OF THEM AND IT'S NOT ME SHOULD TELL YOU YOUR BUSINESS BUT I WOULDN'T TOTE THAT TENT ALONG IF I WAS YOU
THEY WERE UNABLE TO MOVE THE SLED THE LAZY BRUTES I'LL SHOW THEM HE CRIED PREPARING TO LASH OUT AT THEM WITH THE WHIP BUT MERCEDES INTERFERED CRYING OH HAL YOU MUSTN'T
AT THE FOOT OF A PRETTY BIG PINE AND INVOLVED IN A GREEN CREEPER WHICH HAD EVEN PARTLY LIFTED SOME OF THE SMALLER BONES A HUMAN SKELETON LAY WITH A FEW SHREDS OF CLOTHING ON THE GROUND I BELIEVE A CHILL STRUCK FOR A MOMENT TO EVERY HEART
THAT THE CONGESTED MAIL WAS TAKING ON ALPINE PROPORTIONS ALSO THERE WERE OFFICIAL ORDERS FRESH BATCHES OF HUDSON BAY DOGS WERE TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE WORTHLESS FOR THE TRAIL THE WORTHLESS ONES WERE TO BE GOT RID OF
TWO MEN FROM THE STATES CAME ALONG AND BOUGHT THEM HARNESS AND ALL FOR A SONG THE MEN ADDRESSED EACH OTHER AS HAL AND CHARLES CHARLES WAS A MIDDLE AGED LIGHTISH COLORED MAN WITH WEAK AND WATERY EYES AND A MUSTACHE THAT TWISTED FIERCELY AND VIGOROUSLY UP
AND SINCE DOGS COUNT FOR LITTLE AGAINST DOLLARS THEY WERE TO BE SOLD THREE DAYS PASSED BY WHICH TIME BUCK AND HIS MATES FOUND HOW REALLY TIRED AND WEAK THEY WERE THEN ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY
THESE ADDED TO THE SIX OF THE ORIGINAL TEAM AND TEEK AND KOONA THE HUSKIES OBTAINED AT THE RINK RAPIDS ON THE RECORD TRIP BROUGHT THE TEAM UP TO FOURTEEN
BUT HE HAD NOT YET SURRENDERED NOBODY IN THIS HERE ISLAND EVER HEARD OF DARBY HE MUTTERED NOT ONE BUT US THAT'S HERE AND THEN MAKING A GREAT EFFORT SHIPMATES HE CRIED
WHEN ONCE MORE MERCEDES INTERFERED SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE BUCK WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
CAME FROM OUR STOCK AND I COULD SEE THE TRUTH OF SILVER'S WORDS THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD HE NOT STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH THE DOCTOR HE AND HIS MUTINEERS DESERTED BY THE SHIP MUST HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO SUBSIST ON CLEAR WATER AND THE PROCEEDS OF THEIR HUNTING
HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD LIKE A DIVER'S POINTING DIRECTLY IN THE OPPOSITE I'VE TAKEN A NOTION INTO MY OLD NUMBSKULL OBSERVED SILVER HERE'S THE COMPASS THERE'S THE TIP
HAL AND HIS SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW LISTENED UNWILLINGLY PITCHED TENT AND OVERHAULED THE OUTFIT CANNED GOODS WERE TURNED OUT THAT MADE MEN LAUGH FOR CANNED GOODS ON THE LONG TRAIL IS A THING TO DREAM ABOUT
HE A CRIPPLE AND I A BOY AGAINST FIVE STRONG AND ACTIVE SEAMEN ADD TO THIS DOUBLE APPREHENSION THE MYSTERY THAT STILL HUNG OVER THE BEHAVIOUR OF MY FRIENDS THEIR UNEXPLAINED DESERTION OF THE STOCKADE THEIR INEXPLICABLE CESSION OF THE CHART
YOU CAN HELP THEM A MIGHTY LOT BY BREAKING OUT THAT SLED THE RUNNERS ARE FROZE FAST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AGAINST THE GEE POLE RIGHT AND LEFT AND BREAK IT OUT A THIRD TIME THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE
IT WAS NOT THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH BRIEF AND EXCESSIVE EFFORT FROM WHICH RECOVERY IS A MATTER OF HOURS BUT IT WAS THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH THE SLOW AND PROLONGED STRENGTH DRAINAGE OF MONTHS OF TOIL
THIS ARGUMENT SEEMED WEAK ENOUGH TO ME BUT YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT WILL AFFECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS AND TO MY WONDER GEORGE MERRY WAS GREATLY RELIEVED WELL THAT'S SO HE SAID YOU'VE A HEAD UPON YOUR SHOULDERS JOHN AND NO MISTAKE
WHEN THAT UNGODLY BUCCANEER WITH THE BLUE FACE HE WHO DIED AT SAVANNAH SINGING AND SHOUTING FOR DRINK HAD THERE WITH HIS OWN HAND CUT DOWN HIS SIX ACCOMPLICES THIS GROVE THAT WAS NOW SO PEACEFUL
HE WERE AN UGLY DEVIL CRIED A THIRD PIRATE WITH A SHUDDER THAT BLUE IN THE FACE TOO THAT WAS HOW THE RUM TOOK HIM ADDED MERRY BLUE WELL I RECKON HE WAS BLUE
BESIDES THE GREAT CUTLASS AT HIS WAIST AND A PISTOL IN EACH POCKET OF HIS SQUARE TAILED COAT TO COMPLETE HIS STRANGE APPEARANCE CAPTAIN FLINT SAT PERCHED UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GABBLING ODDS AND ENDS OF PURPOSELESS SEA TALK
THINK IT'LL RIDE ONE OF THE MEN ASKED WHY SHOULDN'T IT CHARLES DEMANDED RATHER SHORTLY OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL RIGHT THE MAN HASTENED MEEKLY TO SAY
AND YOU'VE GOT TO WHIP THEM TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THEM THAT'S THEIR WAY YOU ASK ANY ONE ASK ONE OF THOSE MEN MERCEDES LOOKED AT THEM IMPLORINGLY UNTOLD REPUGNANCE AT SIGHT OF PAIN WRITTEN IN HER PRETTY FACE
AFTER TWO EFFORTS THEY STOOD STILL PANTING THE WHIP WAS
AGAIN HAL'S WHIP FELL UPON THE DOGS THEY THREW THEMSELVES AGAINST THE BREAST BANDS DUG THEIR FEET INTO THE PACKED SNOW GOT DOWN LOW TO IT AND PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH THE SLED HELD AS THOUGH IT WERE AN ANCHOR
SHE CRIED IN GENERAL AND SHE CRIED IN PARTICULAR OVER EACH DISCARDED THING SHE CLASPED HANDS ABOUT KNEES ROCKING BACK AND FORTH BROKEN HEARTEDLY
NOR NOT NICE SAYS YOU GREAT GUNS MESSMATES BUT IF FLINT WAS LIVING THIS WOULD BE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU AND ME
RATHER INDEED OF GROWING TERROR AT THE IRREVERENCE OF HIS WORDS BELAY THERE JOHN SAID MERRY DON'T YOU CROSS A SPERRIT AND THE REST WERE ALL TOO TERRIFIED TO REPLY
BUT THERE'S ONE THING NOT CLEAR TO ME THERE WAS AN ECHO NOW NO MAN EVER SEEN A SPERRIT WITH A SHADOW WELL THEN WHAT'S HE DOING WITH AN ECHO TO HIM I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT AIN'T IN NATUR SURELY
DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OF WHICH THEY HAD HAD BUT FIVE DAYS REST WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT SKAGUAY THEY WERE APPARENTLY ON THEIR LAST LEGS THEY COULD BARELY KEEP THE TRACES TAUT AND ON THE DOWN GRADES JUST MANAGED TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE SLED
BY THE POWERS BEN GUNN ROARED SILVER AYE
BEFORE US WAS A GREAT EXCAVATION NOT VERY RECENT FOR THE SIDES HAD FALLEN IN AND GRASS HAD SPROUTED ON THE BOTTOM IN THIS WERE THE SHAFT OF A PICK BROKEN IN TWO AND THE BOARDS OF SEVERAL PACKING CASES STREWN AROUND
THREW WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE FIRE WHICH BLAZED AND ROARED AGAIN OVER THIS UNUSUAL FUEL I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW MEN SO CARELESS OF THE MORROW HAND TO MOUTH IS THE ONLY WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE THEIR WAY OF DOING
AND NOW JIM WE'RE TO GO IN FOR THIS HERE TREASURE HUNTING WITH SEALED ORDERS TOO AND I DON'T LIKE IT AND YOU
INDEED I HAD TO LEND HIM A HAND OR HE MUST HAVE MISSED HIS FOOTING AND FALLEN BACKWARD DOWN THE HILL WE HAD THUS PROCEEDED FOR ABOUT HALF A MILE AND WERE APPROACHING THE BROW OF THE PLATEAU WHEN THE MAN UPON THE FARTHEST LEFT BEGAN TO CRY ALOUD AS IF IN TERROR
FOR MY PART I WAS HORRIBLY CAST DOWN SHOULD THE SCHEME HE HAD NOW SKETCHED PROVE FEASIBLE SILVER ALREADY DOUBLY A TRAITOR WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADOPT IT
I'M HERE TO GET THAT STUFF AND I'LL NOT BE BEAT BY MAN OR DEVIL I NEVER WAS FEARED OF FLINT IN HIS LIFE AND BY THE POWERS I'LL FACE HIM DEAD
JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
A HEAVY SCENTED BROOM AND MANY FLOWERING SHRUBS HAD ALMOST TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRASS THICKETS OF GREEN NUTMEG TREES WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE RED COLUMNS AND THE BROAD SHADOW OF THE PINES AND THE FIRST
THEIR WHOLE SOUL WAS FOUND UP IN THAT FORTUNE THAT WHOLE LIFETIME OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND PLEASURE THAT LAY WAITING THERE FOR EACH OF THEM SILVER HOBBLED GRUNTING ON HIS CRUTCH HIS NOSTRILS STOOD OUT AND QUIVERED
AND SLOPED STEEPLY INTO THE MAIN STREET IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN EXPERIENCED MAN TO KEEP THE TOP HEAVY SLED UPRIGHT AND HAL WAS NOT SUCH A MAN AS THEY SWUNG ON THE TURN THE SLED WENT OVER SPILLING HALF ITS LOAD THROUGH THE LOOSE LASHINGS
IT WAS MAIN HOT AND THE WINDY WAS OPEN AND I HEAR THAT OLD SONG COMIN OUT AS CLEAR AS CLEAR AND THE DEATH HAUL ON THE MAN ALREADY COME COME SAID SILVER STOW THIS TALK HE'S DEAD
AND WRENCHED IT FROM HIM THE POOR DEARS NOW YOU MUST PROMISE YOU WON'T BE HARSH WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP OR I WON'T GO A STEP PRECIOUS LOT YOU KNOW ABOUT DOGS HER BROTHER SNEERED AND I WISH YOU'D LEAVE ME ALONE THEY'RE LAZY I TELL YOU
BUT IF EVER SPERRIT WALKED IT WOULD BE FLINT'S DEAR HEART BUT HE DIED BAD DID FLINT AYE THAT HE DID OBSERVED ANOTHER NOW HE RAGED AND NOW HE HOLLERED FOR THE RUM
KIND HEARTED CITIZENS CAUGHT THE DOGS AND GATHERED UP THE SCATTERED BELONGINGS ALSO THEY GAVE ADVICE HALF THE LOAD AND TWICE THE DOGS
IT ADVERTISED HIS CALLOWNESS A CALLOWNESS SHEER AND UNUTTERABLE BOTH MEN WERE MANIFESTLY OUT OF PLACE
MERRY WALKING FIRST WITH SILVER'S COMPASS TO KEEP THEM ON THE RIGHT LINE WITH SKELETON ISLAND HE HAD SAID THE TRUTH DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDED BEN GUNN DICK ALONE STILL HELD HIS BIBLE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM AS HE WENT WITH FEARFUL GLANCES
WHEN THEY PUT A CLOTHES SACK ON THE FRONT OF THE SLED SHE SUGGESTED IT SHOULD GO ON THE BACK AND WHEN THEY HAD PUT IT ON THE BACK AND COVERED IT OVER WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER BUNDLES SHE DISCOVERED OVERLOOKED ARTICLES WHICH COULD ABIDE NOWHERE ELSE BUT IN THAT VERY SACK AND THEY UNLOADED AGAIN
THE RED CROSS WAS OF COURSE FAR TOO LARGE TO BE A GUIDE AND THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ON THE BACK AS YOU WILL HEAR
THE TOP OF THE PLATEAU WAS DOTTED THICKLY WITH PINE TREES OF VARYING HEIGHT EVERY HERE AND THERE ONE OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES ROSE FORTY OR FIFTY FEET CLEAR ABOVE ITS NEIGHBOURS AND WHICH OF THESE WAS THE PARTICULAR TALL TREE OF CAPTAIN FLINT
AND IN THE NATURE OF REASON AND COMMON JUSTICE THEY DESERVED AN INTERVAL OF LOAFING BUT SO MANY WERE THE MEN WHO HAD RUSHED INTO THE KLONDIKE AND SO MANY WERE THE SWEETHEARTS WIVES AND KIN THAT HAD NOT RUSHED IN
THE PARTY SPREAD ITSELF ABROAD IN A FAN SHAPE SHOUTING AND LEAPING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE CENTRE AND A GOOD WAY BEHIND THE REST SILVER AND I FOLLOWED I TETHERED BY MY ROPE HE PLOUGHING WITH DEEP PANTS AMONG THE SLIDING GRAVEL FROM TIME TO TIME
HE HAD STILL A FOOT IN EITHER CAMP AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT HE WOULD PREFER WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITH THE PIRATES TO A BARE ESCAPE FROM HANGING WHICH WAS THE BEST HE HAD TO HOPE ON OUR SIDE NAY AND EVEN IF THINGS
THEY'RE WEAK AS WATER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW CAME THE REPLY FROM ONE OF THE MEN PLUM TUCKERED OUT THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER THEY NEED A REST REST BE BLANKED SAID HAL WITH HIS BEARDLESS LIPS
IF IT AIN'T NO GOOD TO SWEAR BY WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE A SPERRIT WOULD GIVE FOR IT NOT THAT AND HE SNAPPED HIS BIG FINGERS HALTING A MOMENT ON HIS CRUTCH BUT DICK WAS NOT TO BE COMFORTED INDEED IT WAS SOON PLAIN TO ME THAT THE LAD WAS FALLING SICK
AND NOW HE SANG FIFTEEN MEN WERE HIS ONLY SONG MATES
SHOUT AFTER SHOUT CAME FROM HIM AND THE OTHERS BEGAN TO RUN IN HIS DIRECTION HE CAN'T A FOUND THE TREASURE SAID OLD MORGAN HURRYING PAST US FROM THE RIGHT
DICK HAD HIS BIBLE OUT AND WAS PRAYING VOLUBLY HE HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP HAD DICK BEFORE HE CAME TO SEA AND FELL AMONG BAD COMPANIONS STILL SILVER WAS UNCONQUERED I COULD HEAR HIS TEETH RATTLE IN HIS HEAD
MUST THEN HAVE RUNG WITH CRIES I THOUGHT AND EVEN WITH THE THOUGHT I COULD BELIEVE I HEARD IT RINGING STILL WE WERE NOW AT THE MARGIN OF THE THICKET HUZZA MATES ALL TOGETHER SHOUTED MERRY
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARNESS OF THE GOLD ALL ELSE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIS PROMISE AND THE DOCTOR'S WARNING WERE BOTH THINGS OF THE PAST AND I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOPED TO SEIZE UPON THE TREASURE FIND AND BOARD THE HISPANIOLA UNDER COVER OF NIGHT
SHE WAS CHARLES'S WIFE AND HAL'S SISTER A NICE FAMILY PARTY BUCK WATCHED THEM APPREHENSIVELY AS THEY PROCEEDED TO TAKE DOWN THE TENT AND LOAD THE SLED THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT ABOUT THEIR MANNER BUT NO BUSINESSLIKE METHOD
BUT HE FOUND NO SYMPATHY AND SILVER EVEN JOKED HIM ON HIS PRECAUTIONS I TOLD YOU SAID HE I TOLD YOU YOU HAD SP'ILED YOUR BIBLE
E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
JUST THEN A MAN HAILED US FROM THE FIRE THAT BREAKFAST WAS READY AND WE WERE SOON SEATED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE SAND OVER BISCUIT AND FRIED JUNK
HE CURSED LIKE A MADMAN WHEN THE FLIES SETTLED ON HIS HOT AND SHINY COUNTENANCE HE PLUCKED FURIOUSLY AT THE LINE THAT HELD ME TO HIM AND FROM TIME TO TIME TURNED HIS EYES UPON ME WITH A DEADLY LOOK CERTAINLY HE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE HIS THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY I READ THEM LIKE PRINT
THEY WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY SEVERALLY HAD THEY DARED BUT FEAR KEPT THEM TOGETHER AND KEPT THEM CLOSE BY JOHN AS IF HIS DARING HELPED THEM HE ON HIS PART HAD PRETTY WELL FOUGHT HIS WEAKNESS DOWN SPERRIT WELL MAYBE HE SAID
BOTH WERE TO BE CARRIED ALONG WITH US FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND SO WITH OUR NUMBERS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM WE SET FORTH UPON THE BOSOM OF THE ANCHORAGE AS WE PULLED OVER THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ON THE CHART
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
BUT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE THE HILL BEGAN TO STEEPEN AND BECOME STONY UNDER FOOT AND THE WOOD TO CHANGE ITS CHARACTER AND TO GROW IN A MORE OPEN ORDER IT WAS INDEED A MOST PLEASANT PORTION OF THE ISLAND THAT WE WERE NOW APPROACHING
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TO FIND A BISHOP HERE I RECKON BUT WHAT SORT OF A WAY IS THAT FOR BONES TO LIE TAIN'T IN NATUR INDEED ON A SECOND GLANCE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FANCY THAT THE BODY WAS IN A NATURAL POSITION
THE PIRATES SAILED TO TORTUGA WHERE THEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO GET RID OF THE WEALTH THEY HAD AMASSED THEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY GAMBLED THEY CROWDED THE TAVERNS AS TAVERNS HAVE NEVER BEEN CROWDED BEFORE
AND TOOK THE MARROW BONES WHICH THEY COOKED AND ATE WHILE THEY WERE FRESH ONE OF THE MEN A FRENCHMAN HAD SELECTED A VERY FINE BONE AND HAD PUT IT BY HIS SIDE WHILE HE WAS PREPARING SOME OTHER TIDBITS WHEN AN ENGLISHMAN CAME ALONG PICKED UP THE BONE
WHICH HE COMMANDED THE SMALLER VESSELS NOW DEPARTED FOR TORTUGA
NEARLY ALL THE BUCCANEERS WERE KILLED AND L'OLONNOIS WAS TAKEN PRISONER HIS FURIOUS CAPTORS TORE HIS LIVING BODY APART PIECE BY PIECE AND THREW EACH FRAGMENT INTO THE FIRE
IF THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED FROM ABOVE BY MEANS OF BALLOONS OR FROM BELOW BY MINES AND EXPLOSIVES THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE ADAPTED THEIR STYLE OF DEFENCE TO THE METHOD OF ATTACK THEY ALWAYS DID THIS AND ACCORDING TO ESQUEMELING THEY NEARLY ALWAYS GOT THE BETTER OF THEIR ENEMIES
THE SPANISH GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD HEARD OF THEIR APPROACH AND MET THEM WITH A BODY OF SOLDIERS SO LARGE THAT THEY PRUDENTLY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT A PROCEEDING NOT VERY COMMON WITH THEM BUT MORGAN WAS NOT ONLY A DARE DEVIL OF A PIRATE
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN CASES WHERE THEY DID NOT SUCCEED AS HAPPENED WHEN THEY MARCHED AGAINST THE TOWN OF NATA HE SAYS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND AMPLIFIES ONLY THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR SUCCESSES BUT THE PIRATES ROUTED THE HORSEMEN
THEY FREQUENTLY MET AMBUSCADES OF SPANIARDS WHO ENDEAVORED TO STOP THEIR PROGRESS BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE PIRATES WERE TOO STRONG IN NUMBER AND TOO SAVAGE IN DISPOSITION TO BE RESISTED BY ORDINARY CHRISTIANS AND THEY KEPT ON THEIR WICKED WAY
BRAVOS OR WILD MEN THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONQUER THEM OR TO PACIFY THEM BY KIND TREATMENT THEY HATED THE WHITE MAN AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
FOUND THEMSELVES AS POOR AS WHEN THEY HAD STARTED OFF ON THEIR EXPEDITION IT TOOK THEM ALMOST AS LONG TO DIVIDE THEIR SPOILS AS IT DID TO GET RID OF THEM AS THESE PRECIOUS RASCALS HAD NOW NOTHING TO LIVE UPON
NOW L'OLONNOIS PROPOSED TO HIS MEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAIL FOR GUATEMALA BUT HE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE THE BUCCANEERS WHO HAD ENLISTED UNDER HIM HAD EXPECTED TO MAKE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS EXPEDITION
SO STRONG WAS HIS DISLIKE THAT WHEN HE BECAME A YOUNG MAN HE RAN AWAY TO THE SEACOAST FOR HE HAD A FANCY TO BE A SAILOR THERE HE FOUND A SHIP BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES AND IN THIS HE STARTED OUT ON HIS LIFE'S CAREER
IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH WAS THE UTMOST SUM THEY COULD POSSIBLY RAISE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF BEEF CATTLE
THESE BLOODY PIRATES HAD ALWAYS CONQUERED IN THEIR DESPERATE FIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RECKLESS AND SO SAVAGE BUT NOW THEY HAD FALLEN AMONG THOROUGHBRED SAVAGES MORE CRUEL AND MORE BRUTAL AND PITILESS THAN THEMSELVES
AND AMONG THEIR SPOILS WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES OF ALL AGES AND BOTH SEXES WHO HAD BEEN OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BUT WHO OF COURSE HAD NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM AND WHO WERE NOW CONDEMNED TO A CAPTIVITY
WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN THOSE REGIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CATCH HIMSELF A SUPPER WHEN HE REACHED THE SEA AFTER A TIME THE BUCCANEERS GOT BACK TO THEIR FLEET AND REMAINED ON THE COAST ABOUT THREE MONTHS
BUT WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THEY COULD DISCOVER THEY TORTURED THEIR POOR PRISONERS BY EVERY CRUEL METHOD THEY COULD THINK OF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE MORE TREASURES WERE CONCEALED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATES HAD HAD NOTHING TO HIDE
THEY SWARMED OVER THE WALLS AND CARRIED THE PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE CUTLASS AND THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL IN THIS FIERCE FIGHT MORGAN PERFORMED SUCH FEATS OF VALOR THAT EVEN SOME OF THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO PRAISE HIS EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE
AND CARRIED IT AWAY NOW EVEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF MOTHER GOOSE WE ARE TOLD OF THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN WELSHMEN THIEVERY AND MARROW BONES FOR TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN TAFFY WAS A THIEF TAFFY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A LEG OF BEEF
IN THE PLACES WHERE THESE MEN WERE ENLISTED THEY WERE TERMED SERVANTS BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE NEW WORLD THEY WERE GENERALLY CALLED SLAVES AND TREATED AS SUCH
WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE PIRATES THAT THE WORLD EVER KNEW YET SUCH WAS THE CASE THE BABY'S NAME WAS HENRY MORGAN AND AS HE GREW TO BE A BIG BOY
TELLING THEM NOT TO BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO PAY THE RANSOM DEMANDED BY THE PIRATES BECAUSE HE WAS COMING WITH A STRONG FORCE TO THEIR ASSISTANCE WHEN MORGAN READ THESE LETTERS HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING NOT TO STAY IN THAT REGION ANY LONGER THAN COULD BE HELPED
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT ANY PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED BY THESE DISHONEST KNAVES EVEN IN THEIR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD RIGID RULES IN REGARD TO THE DIVISION OF THEIR SPOILS
AND REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE NICARAGUA RIVER THERE HIS PARTY WAS ATTACKED BY SOME SPANIARDS AND INDIANS WHO KILLED MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AND PREVENTED THE OTHERS FROM LANDING
BUT AFTER THE PROJECT FAILED HE SET ABOUT FORMING ANOTHER EXPEDITION HE WAS NOW RECOGNIZED AS BUCCANEER IN CHIEF OF THE WEST INDIES AND HE VERY SOON GATHERED TOGETHER TWELVE SHIPS AND SEVEN HUNDRED MEN EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY TO SAIL
THEY TOOK WITH THEM EVERYTHING OF VALUE THAT THEY COULD CARRY IF THEIR FORTUNES HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN BANKS IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE PIRATES BEFORE THE CITIZENS RETURNED MORGAN MADE A DISCOVERY
BUT THEIR HIGH HOPES HAD NOT BEEN REALIZED THEY HAD HAD VERY LITTLE BOOTY AND VERY LITTLE FOOD THEY WERE HUNGRY AND DISAPPOINTED AND WANTED TO GO HOME AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM DECLINED TO FOLLOW L'OLONNOIS ANY FARTHER
THEIR VOYAGE WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND THEY WERE BESET BY CALMS AND INSTEAD OF REACHING NICARAGUA THEY DRIFTED INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS HERE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS
AND MADE BREAD FROM SOME WHEAT WHICH WAS AMONG THEIR PROVISIONS THUS MANAGING TO LIVE VERY WELL L'OLONNOIS WAS NEVER INTENDED BY NATURE TO BE A BOAT BUILDER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS USEFUL AND HONEST AND WHEN THE BOAT WAS FINISHED IT WAS DISCOVERED
AND FIND SOME OF THEIR TOWNSMEN WHO HAD ESCAPED WITH A PORTION OF THEIR TREASURE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE DID NOT KEEP THEIR WEALTH IN BANKS AS THEY DO NOW BUT EVERY MAN WAS THE CUSTODIAN OF MOST OF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS AND WHEN THEY FLED FROM THE VISITATION OF AN ENEMY
BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINGUISHED UNTIL A QUARTER OF THE TOWN WAS ENTIRELY BURNED AND A FINE CHURCH REDUCED TO ASHES WHEN THE BUCCANEERS FOUND THEY COULD SQUEEZE NOTHING MORE OUT OF THE TOWN THEY WENT ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS CARRYING WITH THEM ALL THE PLUNDER AND BOOTY THEY HAD COLLECTED
WHEN YOUNG MORGAN REACHED THE BARBADOES HE WAS RESOLD TO A PLANTER AND DURING HIS TERM OF SERVICE HE PROBABLY WORKED A GOOD DEAL HARDER AND WAS TREATED MUCH MORE ROUGHLY THAN ANY OF THE LABORERS ON HIS FATHER'S FARM
AT LAST THEY REACHED A TOWN CALLED SAN PEDRO WHICH WAS FAIRLY WELL DEFENDED HAVING AROUND IT A GREAT HEDGE OF PRICKLY THORNS BUT THORNS CANNOT KEEP OUT PIRATES AND AFTER A SEVERE FIGHT
AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE DONE WAS TO DECIDE WHAT PARTICULAR PLACE THEY SHOULD FAVOR WITH A VISIT THERE WERE SOME WHO ADVISED AN ATTACK UPON HAVANA GIVING AS A REASON THAT IN THAT CITY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY NUNS MONKS AND PRIESTS
HIS FATHER WAS A FARMER AND HIS MOTHER CHURNED AND TENDED THE COWS AND THE CHICKENS AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO IMAGINE THAT THIS GENTLE LITTLE BABY BORN AND REARED IN THIS RURAL SOLITUDE
ON WHICH HE WISHED TO LAND IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND DIVIDE THE PROFITS THIS THE PIRATES ALWAYS DID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEY HAD CONCLUDED ONE OF THEIR NEFARIOUS ENTERPRISES BUT HIS MEN WERE NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ISLAND
THIS EXPEDITION SEEMED A PROMISING ONE TO MORGAN AND HE JOINED IT BEING ELECTED VICE ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET OF FIFTEEN VESSELS SINCE THE SUCCESSES OF L'OLONNOIS AND OTHERS ATTACKS UPON TOWNS HAD BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH THE BUCCANEERS
WHICH HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED BY THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN GATHERING THE CROP WHEN MORGAN'S FLEET ARRIVED AT THE NEAREST HARBOR TO PORT AU PRINCE
RETURNING FROM ONE OF HIS VOYAGES MORGAN FOUND AN OLD BUCCANEER NAMED MANSVELT IN JAMAICA WHO HAD GATHERED TOGETHER A FLEET OF VESSELS
AND THE SPANIARDS GATHERED TOGETHER A SUFFICIENT FORCE TO RETAKE THE ISLAND OF SAINT CATHERINE
SO HE LEFT THE ROAD MARCHED HIS MEN INTO THE WOODS LED THEM ENTIRELY AROUND THE BARRICADES AND THEN AFTER PROCEEDING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE EMERGED UPON A WIDE PLAIN WHICH LAY BEFORE THE TOWN
AND THE PIRATES PROMISED THAT IF THIS WERE DONE THEY WOULD DEPART AND MOLEST THE TOWN NO MORE THE MONEY WAS PAID THE CATTLE WERE PUT ON BOARD THE SHIPS AND TO THE UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF OF THE CITIZENS
AND THEY MIGHT NOW HAVE SAILED BACK TO THE ISLAND WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COMRADES
WHERE HE PROPOSED TO PILLAGE AND DEVASTATE AS MANY TOWNS AND VILLAGES AS POSSIBLE HIS REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL COMMANDER WAS NOW SO HIGH THAT HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTING MEN FOR MORE OFFERED THEMSELVES THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE
AND AFTER A FIGHT OF ABOUT FOUR HOURS THEY ROUTED ALL THE OTHER SPANIARDS WHO RESISTED THEM AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN HERE THEY CAPTURED A GREAT MANY PRISONERS WHICH THEY SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES AND THEN SENT DETACHMENTS OUT INTO THE COUNTRY TO LOOK FOR THOSE WHO HAD RUN AWAY
MORGAN ESTIMATED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE BOOTY TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUM WAS DIVIDED MANY OF THE MEN COMPLAINED THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR DEBTS IN JAMAICA THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTONISHED
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE BUT THEIR GREEDY SOULS WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BOOTY THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED AND THEY THEREFORE SENT MESSAGES TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WERE STILL CONCEALED IN THE FORESTS
A NEGRO WAS CAPTURED WHO CARRIED LETTERS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF SANTIAGO A NEIGHBORING CITY
AND HERE THE YOUNG MAN DETERMINED TO STUDY PIRACY HE WAS NOT A SAILOR AND HUNTER
BUT A VERY SHREWD WELSHMAN THEY RETURNED TO THE SHIPS AND AFTER TOUCHING AT SAINT CATHERINE
HE DEPARTED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AND SIX SHIPS STOPPING ON THE WAY NEAR THE COAST OF CUBA AND ROBBING SOME POOR FISHERMEN OF THEIR BOATS WHICH HE WOULD NEED IN SHALLOW WATER
WHOSE LEADERS WERE GETTING TO BE TIRED OF THE RETAIL BRANCH OF THEIR BUSINESS THAT IS SAILING ABOUT IN ONE SHIP AND CAPTURING SUCH MERCHANTMEN AS IT MIGHT FALL IN WITH MANSVELT'S EXPEDITION TOOK WITH IT NOT ONLY SIX HUNDRED FIGHTING PIRATES BUT ONE WRITING PIRATE
WHERE THEY HOPED TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT IF THEY COULD FIND NOTHING ELSE THEY MIGHT AT LEAST CATCH FISH ON THEIR WAY EVERY RASCAL OF THEM PREPARED HIMSELF A NET
THIS WAS GIVEN AND THE TIME WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE IN RUNNING AWAY INTO THE WOODS AND CARRYING OFF THEIR VALUABLES BUT WHEN THE TWO HOURS HAD EXPIRED L'OLONNOIS AND HIS MEN ENTERED THE TOWN AND INSTEAD OF RUMMAGING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
AND IF THEY COULD CAPTURE THEM THEY MIGHT ASK AS RANSOM FOR THEM A SUM A GREAT DEAL LARGER THAN THEY COULD EXPECT TO GET FROM THE PILLAGE OF AN ORDINARY TOWN BUT HAVANA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO STRONG A PLACE FOR A PROFITABLE VENTURE
WHEN MORGAN CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THIS BARRICADE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SPANIARDS HAD DISCOVERED HIS APPROACH AND SO HE CALLED A HALT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO UNNECESSARY WORK
BUT HE DELIBERATELY SELECTED HIS PROFESSION AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PRACTICE THERE WAS A BUCCANEER SHIP ABOUT TO SAIL FROM JAMAICA AND ON THIS MORGAN ENLISTED HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW
AND WERE OBLIGED TO LAND AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT LEAVING THEIR SHIPS THEY BEGAN A LAND MARCH THROUGH THE UNFORTUNATE REGION WHERE THEY NOW FOUND THEMSELVES THEY ROBBED INDIANS THEY ROBBED VILLAGES
AND ACCORDING TO THESE CURIOUS REGULATIONS THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF PLUNDER WAS APPORTIONED AMONG THE OFFICERS AND CREWS OF THE DIFFERENT SHIPS BEFORE THE REGULAR ALLOTMENT OF SHARES WAS MADE
HE HAD NO MONEY TO PAY HIS PASSAGE AND HE THEREFORE FOLLOWED THE USUAL CUSTOM OF THOSE DAYS AND SOLD HIMSELF FOR A TERM OF THREE YEARS TO AN AGENT WHO WAS TAKING OUT A NUMBER OF MEN TO WORK ON THE PLANTATIONS
NO MORE DREADFUL MISERIES COULD BE CONCEIVED THAN THOSE INFLICTED UPON THE PEACEFUL INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THESE WRETCHES PASSED
THAT AFTER HAVING SACKED AN ENTIRELY FRESH TOWN THEY SHOULD HAVE SO LITTLE AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MANY OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THEIR LEADER WAS A MAN WHO CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENRICHING HIMSELF WHILE HE GAVE HIS FOLLOWERS BARELY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM QUIET
THEIR GREAT OBJECT WAS TO TAKE EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIND AND THEN TRY TO MAKE THE PEOPLE CONFESS WHERE OTHER THINGS WERE HIDDEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE HACKED TO PIECES WITH SWORDS
ONE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BEING CARRIED AWAY INTO SLAVERY AND ONE TO KEEP THEIR TOWN FROM BEING BURNED THE SAME PUNISHMENTS WOULD BE INFLICTED UPON THEM FOR TWO WEEKS THE PIRATES WAITED FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT WHEN HIS WELL ARMED HORSEMEN CHARGED UPON THESE MEN ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING ON THE DECKS OF SHIPS AND TOTALLY UNUSED TO CAVALRY COMBATS HE WOULD SOON SCATTER AND DISPERSE THEM BUT PIRATES ARE PECULIAR FIGHTERS
THEY TORTURED THE POOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE THEY HAD HID THEIR TREASURES AND NOTHING WAS TOO VILE OR TOO WICKED FOR THEM TO DO IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD PROFIT BY IT THEY HAD COME FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE POSSESSED
AND THE TWO DAYS PASSED WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF THE RANSOM AND THE RELENTLESS PIRATES PROMPTLY CARRIED OUT THEIR THREAT AND SET THE TOWN ON FIRE IN VARIOUS PLACES WHEN THE POOR SPANIARDS SAW THIS AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO LOSE EVEN THEIR HOMES
THE FLEET SAILED DIRECTLY FOR SAINT CATHERINE AN ISLAND NEAR COSTA RICA WHICH WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS AND USED BY THEM AS A STATION FOR AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND ALSO AS A PRISON
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS A FREE MAN HE WENT TO JAMAICA AND THERE WERE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE A YOUNG MAN COULD BE MORE FREE AND MORE INDEPENDENT THAN IN THIS LAWLESS ISLAND HERE WERE ROLLICKING AND BLUSTERING
FOR A MISSING LEFT LEG FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FOUR SLAVES FOR AN EYE OR A FINGER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
AND TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE LOWER THAN THE BRUTE BEASTS THEY ALLOWED THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE PRISONERS COLLECTED IN THE CHURCH TO PERISH OF HUNGER THERE WERE NOT PROVISIONS ENOUGH IN THE TOWN FOR THE PIRATES OWN USES AND FOR THESE MISERABLE CREATURES ALSO AND SO
WHEN THEY FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THEIR GREAT VESSEL OFF THE SAND BANKS THE PIRATES SET TO WORK TO BREAK HER UP AND BUILD A BOAT OUT OF HER PLANKS THIS WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING BUT IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO
NO OTHER BUCCANEERING VESSEL WAS SO WIDELY KNOWN AND SO GREATLY FEARED AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS WERE AS PROUD OF THE YOUNG CAPTAIN MORGAN AS IF HE HAD BEEN A REGULARLY COMMISSIONED ADMIRAL CRUISING AGAINST AN ACKNOWLEDGED ENEMY
INTO THE LITTLE VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HUNTERS AND SMALL FARMERS WERE CAPTURED AND MADE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY POSSESSED WHICH WAS WORTH TAKING FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS THESE OUTRAGEOUS PROCEEDINGS CONTINUED
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING A SECRET ATTACK AS HE HAD HOPED ONE OF HIS PRISONERS A SPANIARD LET HIMSELF DROP OVERBOARD AS SOON AS THE VESSELS CAST ANCHOR AND SWIMMING ASHORE
HE DID SO WITH THE IDEA OF FOUNDING THERE A PERMANENT PIRATE PRINCIPALITY THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENGLISH FRENCH OR DUTCH BUT PLAIN PIRATES HAVING A NATIONALITY AND COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN
SO THAT HE COULD HOLD THE ISLAND AS A REGULAR STATION FOR THE ASSEMBLING AND FITTING OUT OF PIRATE VESSELS THE PERMANENT PIRATE COLONY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO REENFORCEMENTS WERE SENT MANSVELT DIED
THE CLAIMS OF THE WOUNDED WERE FULLY SATISFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTABLISHED CODE FOR THE LOSS OF A RIGHT ARM A MAN WAS PAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SIX SLAVES FOR THE LOSS OF A LEFT ARM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
AND THEY OCCUPIED PART OF THE TIME IN GARDENING PLANTING FRENCH BEANS WHICH CAME TO MATURITY IN SIX WEEKS AND GAVE THEM SOME FRESH VEGETABLES
AND CONSEQUENTLY THE GREATER PART OF THEM BANDED TOGETHER AND DELIBERATELY DESERTED MORGAN WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO BACK TO JAMAICA WITH NOT MORE THAN HALF HIS REGULAR FORCES
AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO JAMAICA AND DELIVER HIM TO JUSTICE BUT THE FRENCHMEN DECLINED TO BE SATISFIED THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY LITTLE MONEY AFTER THEY HAD PILLAGED A RICH TOWN AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR ENGLISH COMPANIONS WERE INCLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN EVERY WAY
THERE WAS PLENTY OF FRESH WATER AND THE GROUND COULD BE CULTIVATED
THEY SOLD THEIR VALUABLE MERCHANDISE FOR A TWENTIETH PART OF ITS VALUE TO SOME OF THE MORE LEVEL HEADED PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND HAVING RIOTED GAMBLED AND COMMITTED EVERY SORT OF EXTRAVAGANCE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS
HAD THE SEED THUS PLANTED BY MANSVELT AND MORGAN GROWN AND MATURED IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WEST INDIES MIGHT NOW BE OWNED AND INHABITED BY AN INDEPENDENT NATION WHOSE FOUNDERS WERE THE BOLD BUCCANEERS
AND THEN HE SENT SOME MESSENGERS ASHORE TO INFORM THE ALREADY HALF RUINED CITIZENS THAT UNLESS THEY SENT HIM THIRTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT HE WOULD ENTER THEIR TOWN AGAIN CARRY AWAY EVERYTHING THEY HAD LEFT AND BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND THE POOR CITIZENS
CHAPTER SIXTEEN A PIRATE POTENTATE SOMETIME IN THE LAST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ON A QUIET FARM IN A SECLUDED PART OF WALES THERE WAS BORN A LITTLE BOY BABY
WAITING FOR SOME EXPECTED SPANISH SHIPS WHICH THEY HOPED TO CAPTURE THEY EVENTUALLY MET WITH ONE AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF ORDINARY FIGHTING AND STRATAGEM THEY BOARDED AND TOOK HER BUT FOUND HER NOT A VERY VALUABLE PRIZE
THERE WAS HOWEVER ANOTHER CAUSE OF DISCONTENT AMONG A LARGE BODY OF THE MEN IT APPEARS THAT THE MEN WERE VERY FOND OF MARROW BONES
I WENT TO TAFFY'S HOUSE TAFFY WASN'T HOME TAFFY WENT TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A MARROW BONE WHAT HAPPENED TO TAFFY WE DO NOT KNOW BUT MORGAN WAS A WELSHMAN MORGAN WAS A THIEF AND ONE OF HIS MEN HAD STOLEN A MARROW BONE THEREFORE CAME TROUBLE
THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT THEY WOULD BE SO GLAD TO FURNISH HIM AS A PILOT TO SHOW HIM HOW TO SAIL AWAY FROM THEIR SHORES THE PILOT WAS INSTANTLY SENT TO THE FLEET AND L'OLONNOIS AND HIS DEVASTATING BAND DEPARTED
AT LAST A DESERTER FROM THE SPANISH ARMY WHO HAD JOINED THEM CAME FORWARD WITH A GOOD IDEA HE TOLD THE PIRATES OF A TOWN IN CUBA TO WHICH HE KNEW THE WAY IT WAS NAMED
THIS WAS A BLOW TO MORGAN
AND ABILITY AS A LEADER THE BUCCANEERS PROCEEDED TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THEIR VICTORY THEY CAPTURED SOME SMALL ADJOINING ISLANDS AND BROUGHT THE CANNON FROM THEM TO THE MAIN FORTRESS
THESE LATTER WERE APPORTIONED AMONG THE MEN IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS MANNER THE PIRATES HAVING NO IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE JEWELS SOME OF THEM PREFERRING LARGE AND WORTHLESS COLORED STONES TO SMALLER DIAMONDS AND RUBIES WHEN ALL THEIR WICKEDLY GAINED PROPERTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
SENT A COMMITTEE TO CONFER WITH THE PIRATES AND WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON SOME OF THE CONSCIENCELESS BUCCANEERS WENT ON SHORE AND CARRIED OFF FROM ONE OF THE GREAT CHURCHES ITS IMAGES PICTURES AND EVEN ITS BELLS
BUT THERE WERE SOME WHO DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GO HOME TO TORTUGA AS POOR AS WHEN THEY LEFT IT
THEY DEVASTATED LITTLE TOWNS TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARED FOR AND BURNING WHAT THEY DID NOT WANT AND TREATING THE PEOPLE THEY CAPTURED WITH VILER CRUELTIES THAN ANY IN WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD YET INDULGED
THEY DID NOT GO DIRECTLY TO TORTUGA BUT STOPPED AT A LITTLE ISLAND NEAR HISPANIOLA WHICH WAS INHABITED BY FRENCH BUCCANEERS AND THIS DELAY WAS MADE ENTIRELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVIDING THE BOOTY
THE FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED THE ENGLISHMAN BUT THE LATTER BEING A MEAN SCOUNDREL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS OPPONENT UNFAIRLY STABBED HIM IN THE BACK AND KILLED HIM NOW ALL THE FRENCHMEN IN THE COMPANY ROSE IN FURIOUS PROTEST
WHO DID NOT FIND PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO FEED HIS MEN THEIR SUPPLIES RAN VERY LOW AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF STARVATION CONSEQUENTLY THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY THE MOST DIRECT COURSE TO THE COAST
THAT IT HAD BEEN PLANNED SO BADLY THAT IT WOULD NOT HOLD THEM ALL SO ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO DRAW LOTS TO SEE WHO SHOULD EMBARK IN HER FOR ONE HALF OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO STAY UNTIL THE OTHERS CAME BACK TO RELEASE THEM
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF MULE FLESH WHICH MANY OF THE PRISONERS COULD NOT EAT THEY GOT NOTHING WHATEVER AND SLOWLY STARVED WHEN L'OLONNOIS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN IN POSSESSION OF GIBRALTAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH
SO HE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO COLLECT THE HEAVY RANSOM HE DEMANDED BUT TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AND ALSO SUPPLY SALT AND HELP PREPARE THE MEAT FOR SHIPMENT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DEMANDS UPON THEM
OF THIS MONSTER IF IN HIS INFANCY HE HAD DIED OF CROUP
THEY HAD HEARD OF L'OLONNOIS AND HIS BUCCANEERS AND WHEN THEY FOUND THIS NOTORIOUS PIRATE UPON THEIR SHORES
IT WAS NECESSARY TO START OUT AGAIN AND COMMIT SOME MORE ACTS OF ROBBERY AND RUIN AND L'OLONNOIS WHOSE RAPACIOUS MIND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH A DESIRE FOR TOWN DESTROYING PROJECTED AN EXPEDITION TO NICARAGUA
BUT WENT TO THE COAST OF CARTAGENA THE PIRATES LEFT ON THE ISLAND WERE EVENTUALLY TAKEN OFF BY A BUCCANEERING VESSEL BUT L'OLONNOIS HAD NOW REACHED THE END OF THE STRING BY WHICH THE DEVIL HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GAMBOL ON THIS EARTH FOR SO LONG A TIME
THEN THESE UTTERLY DEBASED AND CRUEL MEN BEGAN THEIR USUAL COURSE AFTER CAPTURING A TOWN THEY PILLAGED FEASTED AND RIOTED THEY GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE NEEDS OF THE PRISONERS WHOM THEY HAD SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES MANY OF WHOM STARVED TO DEATH
THEY COULD NOT SWIM AWAY AND THEIR SHIP WAS OF NO USE TO THEM AS SHE WAS BUT WHEN THEY BEGAN TO WORK THEY HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO BUILD A BOAT IT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE UNWIELDY CRAFT WAS FINISHED
TO TEAR OUT HIS TONGUE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND IT IS SAID THAT ON SOME OCCASIONS HIS FURY WAS SO GREAT THAT HE WOULD CUT OUT THE HEART OF A MAN AND BITE AT IT WITH HIS GREAT TEETH
AND THEREFORE COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION TO THEIR BRUTAL INQUISITORS AND OTHERS DIED WITHOUT TELLING WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH THEIR VALUABLES WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED AND SIFTED THE PIRATES SENT MEN OUT
WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DONE THEY FELT SAFE AND BEGAN TO ACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A MENAGERIE OF WILD BEASTS LET LOOSE UPON A BODY OF DEFENCELESS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN NOT ONLY DID THESE WRETCHED MEN RUSH INTO THE HOUSES STEALING EVERYTHING VALUABLE THEY COULD FIND AND WERE ABLE TO CARRY AWAY
FOR JOHN ESQUEMELING ACCOMPANIED IT AND SO FAR AS THE FAME AND REPUTATION OF THESE ADVENTURERS WAS CONCERNED HIS PEN WAS MIGHTIER THAN THEIR SWORDS FOR HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS ACCOUNT OF THEIR DEEDS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD
WORSE THAN ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE NOW THE EIGHT SHIPS WITH THEIR DEMON CREWS SAILED AWAY OVER THE LAKE TOWARD MARACAIBO IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO SEA WITHOUT REVISITING THIS UNFORTUNATE TOWN
HERE HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT HIS WAY INTO THE CITY AND PROBABLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE HIS MEN WERE PRESENTLY CHARGED BY A BODY OF CAVALRY PIRATES AS A RULE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HORSES EITHER IN PEACE OR WAR
AND ALL PRESENT EXCEPT OURSELVES WENT TO THE COFFIN TO GIVE HER THE KISS OF FAREWELL ONE OF THE LAST TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER DEPARTED MISTRESS WAS A PEASANT WOMAN WHO WAS HOLDING BY THE HAND
I FELT A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM FOR THAT VERY ABILITY TO APPEAR EFFECTIVE AT SUCH A MOMENT MIMI STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AS THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER DRESS WAS ALL AWRY AND COVERED WITH FEATHERS
A GARMENT WHICH WAS TIGHT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND UPON HOW TO AVOID SOILING MY TROUSERS AT THE KNEES ALSO I TOOK THE MOST MINUTE NOTICE OF ALL PRESENT PAPA STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN
A PASSION WHICH BEREAVES ME OF PART OF YOUR TENDER AFFECTION AND OBLIGES ME TO TELL YOU SUCH BITTER TRUTHS AS GOD KNOWS WITH WHAT PAIN I AM NOW TELLING YOU I NEVER CEASE TO BESEECH HIM THAT HE MAY PRESERVE US
HE MIGHT TAKE ME FOR AN UNFEELING BOY WHO HAD CLIMBED ON TO THE CHAIR OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY WHEREFORE I HASTENED TO MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS TO BEND DOWN MY HEAD AND TO BURST OUT CRYING
GO AND RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU WE SHALL ALL OF US BE LONELY SPRING IS COMING IN BEAUTIFULLY WE KEEP THE DOOR ON TO THE TERRACE ALWAYS OPEN NOW WHILE THE PATH TO THE ORANGERY
AND KEPT HEARING STRANGE NOISES IN MY EARS I WOULD BEGIN ONE TWO THREE AND THEN SUDDENLY GO ON EIGHT FIFTEEN AND SO ON AS THOUGH I WERE TALKING NONSENSE AND COULD NOT HELP IT
KATENKA STOOD NEAR HER MOTHER AND DESPITE HER LENGTHENED FACE LOOKED AS LOVELY AS EVER WOLODA'S FRANK NATURE WAS FRANK ALSO IN GRIEF HE STOOD LOOKING GRAVE
THOUGH STILL UNABLE TO TURN MY EYES AWAY THEN AGAIN THE DREAMS WOULD REPLACE REALITY THEN AGAIN THE REALITY PUT TO FLIGHT THE DREAMS AT LAST THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BOTH LEFT ME
THE HORSES AND CARRIAGE STUCK FAST IN THE MUD WELL THE DAY BEING FINE I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD WALK A LITTLE UP THE ROAD UNTIL THE CARRIAGE SHOULD BE EXTRICATED BUT NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THE CHAPEL
YOU KNOW MY OBJECTION TO THAT KIND OF EDUCATION I DO NOT KNOW DEAR WHETHER YOU WILL ACCEDE TO MY REQUEST BUT I NEVERTHELESS BESEECH YOU BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME TO GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE THAT NEVER SO LONG AS I AM ALIVE
KATENKA IS AS CHARMING AS USUAL AND MIMI TOO IS GOOD BUT TIRESOME NOW LET ME SPEAK OF MORE SERIOUS MATTERS YOU WRITE TO ME THAT YOUR AFFAIRS ARE NOT GOING WELL THIS WINTER
MIMI'S AND KATENKA'S FORTUNES SECURE FOR EVER MIMI HAD SHED BITTER TEARS WHILE RELATING THIS AND VERY LIKELY HER SORROW IF NOT WHOLLY PURE AND DISINTERESTED WAS IN THE MAIN SINCERE
UPON YOUR INCOME THEREFORE YOUR LOSSES CAUSE ME AS LITTLE ANXIETY AS YOUR GAINS GIVE ME PLEASURE WHAT I REALLY GRIEVE OVER IS YOUR UNHAPPY PASSION ITSELF FOR GAMBLING
THE FACE WHICH I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN ALL THE WORLD WAS NOW CAPABLE OF INSPIRING HORROR AT LENGTH REVEALED TO ME AS THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND I ONLY NEED YOUR PRESENCE TO REALISE THEM THE REST OF THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN FRENCH AS WELL AS IN A STRANGE UNCERTAIN HAND ON ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER I TRANSCRIBE IT WORD FOR WORD
I MOUNTED A CHAIR TO SEE HER FACE YET WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I COULD SEE ONLY THAT WAX LIKE TRANSPARENT SOMETHING I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE HER FACE YET
ON THE CONTRARY I AM PERFECTLY CLEAR AT THIS MOMENT AND ABSOLUTELY CALM NOR MUST YOU COMFORT YOURSELF WITH THE FALSE HOPE THAT THESE ARE THE UNREAL CONFUSED FEELINGS OF A DESPONDENT SPIRIT
SOME OF THEM IN REFERRING TO OURSELVES CALLED US ORPHANS JUST AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER ARE KNOWN AS ORPHANS PROBABLY I THOUGHT
WHY WERE THE LIPS SO WHITE AND THEIR OUTLINE SO BEAUTIFUL SO MAJESTIC SO EXPRESSIVE OF AN UNNATURAL CALM THAT AS I LOOKED AT THEM A CHILL SHUDDER RAN THROUGH MY HAIR
YES IT IS THE HEAVY CROSS WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN US BOTH TO CARRY ALSO YOU WRITE ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND COME BACK TO OUR OLD POINT OF DIFFERENCE BY ASKING MY CONSENT TO YOUR PLACING THEM AT A BOARDING SCHOOL
AND DOWN MY BACK SOMEHOW AS I GAZED AN IRREPRESSIBLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE POWER SEEMED TO COMPEL ME TO KEEP MY EYES FIXED UPON THAT LIFELESS FACE I COULD NOT TURN AWAY
THE CANDLES THE BROCADE THE VELVET THE GREAT CANDELABRA THE PINK SATIN CUSHION TRIMMED WITH LACE THE CHAPLET OF FLOWERS THE RIBBONED CAP AND SOMETHING OF A TRANSPARENT
THAT FOR FEAR OF WORRYING ME YOU CONCEAL THE REAL STATE OF THINGS BUT I CAN GUESS THAT YOU HAVE LOST A GREAT DEAL AT CARDS AS ALSO THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF MY BEING ANGRY AT THAT YET SO LONG AS YOU CAN TIDE OVER THIS CRISIS
I THINK OF GETTING UP TO MORROW ON FRIDAY LAST I TOOK THE GIRLS FOR A DRIVE AND CLOSE TO THE LITTLE BRIDGE BY THE TURNING ON TO THE HIGH ROAD THE PLACE WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS
LUBOTSHKA IN BLACK GARMENTS AND SUFFUSED WITH TEARS STOOD WITH HER HEAD BOWED UPON HER BREAST SHE RARELY LOOKED AT THE COFFIN YET WHENEVER SHE DID SO HER FACE EXPRESSED A SORT OF CHILDISH FEAR
AND AS THOUGH HE WERE STARING AT SOME OBJECT WITH FIXED EYES THEN SUDDENLY HIS LIPS WOULD BEGIN TO QUIVER AND HE WOULD HASTILY MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND BEND HIS HEAD AGAIN
THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN BED YET DO NOT BE UNEASY I FEEL ALMOST MYSELF AGAIN NOW
THE THING AT WHICH I WAS GAZING UNCONSCIOUSLY AS AT AN OBJECT WHICH HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH MY DREAMS WAS SHE I FANCIED I COULD SEE HER NOW HERE NOW THERE
THEY LIKED TO BE THE FIRST TO GIVE US THAT NAME JUST AS SOME PEOPLE FIND PLEASURE IN BEING THE FIRST TO ADDRESS A NEWLY MARRIED GIRL AS MADAME IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM
IS DRY AND THE PEACH TREES ARE IN FULL BLOSSOM ONLY HERE AND THERE IS THERE A LITTLE SNOW REMAINING THE SWALLOWS ARE ARRIVING AND TO DAY LUBOTSHKA BROUGHT ME THE FIRST FLOWERS
AND TOLD ME TO BURN IT IF NOT YET DESPATCHED SHE IS FOREVER SPEAKING OF IT AND SAYING THAT IT WILL KILL YOU DO NOT DELAY YOUR DEPARTURE FOR AN INSTANT IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE ANGEL BEFORE SHE LEAVES US PRAY EXCUSE THIS SCRIBBLE
SUCH OF THOSE PRESENT AS WERE STRANGERS I FOUND INTOLERABLE
AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND ASKED WHAT THE MATTER WAS AH NATALIA SAVISHNA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN SHE SAID
AND THAT YOU WISH TO BREAK INTO THE REVENUES OF CHABAROVSKA IT SEEMS TO ME STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO ASK MY CONSENT SURELY WHAT BELONGS TO ME BELONGS NO LESS TO YOU YOU ARE SO KIND HEARTED DEAR
WHY MUST YOU MY HUSBAND EXPERIENCE SUCH A HEAVY AND UNLOOKED FOR BLOW WHY MUST I DIE WHEN YOUR LOVE WAS MAKING LIFE SO INEXPRESSIBLY HAPPY FOR ME BUT HIS HOLY WILL BE DONE
YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED TO HEAR WHAT PROGRESS SHE HAS MADE BUT IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT COUNT THE BEATS SEVERAL TIMES I BEGAN TO DO SO YET ALWAYS FELT CONFUSED IN MY HEAD
AND EXPERIENCED A KIND OF VAGUE BLISSFULNESS WHICH THOUGH GRAND AND SWEET WAS ALSO SAD IT MAY BE THAT AS IT ASCENDED TO A BETTER WORLD HER BEAUTIFUL SOUL HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH LONGING AT THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT US
THE TEARS PREVENT MY WRITING MORE IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN I THANK YOU MY DARLING BEYOND ALL PRICE FOR ALL THE FELICITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE SURROUNDED ME IN THIS LIFE
ONLY NOW DID I UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF THE STRONG OPPRESSIVE SMELL WHICH MINGLING WITH THE SCENT OF THE INCENSE FILLED THE CHAMBER WHILE THE THOUGHT THAT THE FACE WHICH BUT A FEW DAYS AGO HAD BEEN FULL OF FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY
NOT FROM POVERTY FOR WHAT IS POVERTY BUT FROM THE TERRIBLE JUNCTURE WHICH WOULD ARISE SHOULD THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN WHICH I AM CALLED UPON TO PROTECT EVER COME INTO COLLISION WITH OUR OWN
STANDING ON THE CHAIR NEAR THE COFFIN WAS THE PEASANT WOMAN WHILE STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING IN HER ARMS WAS THE LITTLE GIRL AND IT WAS THIS SAME POOR CHILD WHO HAD SCREAMED WITH SUCH DREADFUL DESPERATE FRENZY
AND FOR A WHILE I BECAME INSENSIBLE HOW LONG I REMAINED IN THAT CONDITION I DO NOT KNOW NOR YET HOW IT OCCURRED I ONLY KNOW THAT FOR A TIME I LOST ALL SENSE OF EXISTENCE
A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL OF FIVE WHOM SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER GOD KNOWS FOR WHAT REASON JUST AT A MOMENT WHEN I CHANCED TO DROP MY WET HANDKERCHIEF AND WAS STOOPING TO PICK IT UP AGAIN A LOUD PIERCING SCREAM STARTLED ME
AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH TERROR THAT WERE I TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS MORE I SHOULD NEVER FORGET IT EVEN NOW THE RECOLLECTION ALWAYS SENDS A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY FRAME I RAISED MY HEAD
THE NOISE AWAKENED ME AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SEEING ME STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN A POSTURE WHICH HAD NOTHING TOUCHING IN ITS ASPECT
I CONFESS SAID NATALIA SAVISHNA THAT I TOO FELL ASLEEP IN THE ARM CHAIR AND LET MY KNITTING SLIP FROM MY HANDS SUDDENLY TOWARDS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I HEARD HER SAYING SOMETHING
BUT IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH ACCORDING TO HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE MOVES SHE WILL BE WASTED THE IDEA HAS MORE THAN ONCE OCCURRED TO ME THAT HAD I NOT HAD SO MANY CHILDREN OF MY OWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEED OF MERCY TO HAVE ADOPTED HER
AT TEN O'CLOCK WE WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE PRE FUNERAL REQUIEM THE ROOM WAS FULL OF WEEPING SERVANTS AND PEASANTS WHO HAD COME TO BID FAREWELL TO THEIR LATE MISTRESS DURING THE SERVICE I MYSELF WEPT A GREAT DEAL
AT THIS MOMENT I AM TOO FULL OF THAT LOVE TO BE CAPABLE OF BELIEVING THAT SUCH A FEELING WHICH CONSTITUTES A PART OF MY VERY EXISTENCE CAN EVER PERISH MY SOUL CAN NEVER LACK ITS LOVE FOR YOU
I BEG OF YOU EITHER ON ACCOUNT OF MY ILLNESS OR ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR LOSSES AT PLAY END THE CRISIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN RETURN HERE WITH THE CHILDREN FOR THE SUMMER I AM MAKING WONDERFUL PLANS FOR OUR PASSING OF IT
WHAT HAD LAID THAT DREADFUL PALENESS UPON HER CHEEKS AND STAMPED THE BLACK SPOT BENEATH THE TRANSPARENT SKIN ON ONE OF THEM
ALIVE HAPPY AND SMILING THEN SOME WELL KNOWN FEATURE IN THE FACE AT WHICH I WAS GAZING WOULD SUDDENLY ARREST MY ATTENTION AND IN A FLASH I WOULD RECALL THE TERRIBLE REALITY AND SHUDDER
AND HER CAP COCKED TO ONE SIDE WHILE HER EYES WERE RED WITH WEEPING HER LEGS TREMBLING UNDER HER AND SHE SOBBED INCESSANTLY IN A HEARTRENDING MANNER AS EVER AND AGAIN SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF OR HER HANDS
AT LEAST FROM OTHERS LET US TRY TO BEAR THE CALAMITY WITH FORTITUDE AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN THE MERCY OF GOD LET US SUBMIT OURSELVES TO HIS WILL DO NOT THINK THAT WHAT I AM WRITING IS SOME DELUSION OF MY SICK IMAGINATION
AND SHE IS MOST ATTENTIVE AND ATTACHED TO ME SHE EVEN TELLS ME HER SECRET AFFAIRS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HER BEAUTIFUL FACE GOOD TEMPER AND YOUTH MIGHT HAVE MADE A MOST EXCELLENT GIRL OF HER
IN WHICH THE LATTER SAID THE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH SHE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ARE BUT TOO SURELY CONFIRMED BY THE WORDS OF THE DOCTOR YESTERDAY EVENING SHE ORDERED THE LETTER TO BE POSTED AT ONCE
BUT THINKING AT SHE DID SO IN DELIRIUM I WAITED UNTIL THIS MORNING WITH THE INTENTION OF SEALING AND SENDING IT THEN HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN NATALIA NICOLAEVNA ASKED ME WHAT I HAD DONE WITH THE LETTER
SOON I SHALL APPEAR BEFORE GOD HIMSELF TO PRAY THAT HE MAY REWARD YOU FAREWELL MY DEAREST REMEMBER THAT IF I AM NO LONGER HERE
AS I RECALL NOW MY IMPRESSIONS OF THAT EPISODE I FIND THAT IT WAS ONLY DURING MY MOMENTS OF SELF FORGETFULNESS THAT MY GRIEF WAS WHOLEHEARTED TRUE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE FUNERAL I NEVER CEASED TO CRY
THAT NIGHT I SLEPT CALMLY AND SOUNDLY AS IS USUAL AFTER ANY GREAT EMOTION AND AWOKE WITH MY TEARS DRIED AND MY NERVES RESTORED
THERE STANDS ONE WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND FELT ASHAMED THE REQUIEM WAS OVER THEY UNCOVERED THE FACE OF THE DECEASED
MADE FREQUENT SIGNS OF THE CROSS AND PERFORMED MANY GENUFLECTIONS BUT I DID NOT PRAY WITH MY SOUL AND FELT IF ANYTHING ALMOST INDIFFERENT MY THOUGHTS WERE CHIEFLY CENTRED UPON THE NEW COAT WHICH I WAS WEARING
AND TO LOOK MISERABLE YET I FEEL CONSCIENCE STRICKEN WHEN I RECALL THAT GRIEF OF MINE SEEING THAT ALWAYS PRESENT IN IT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF CONCEIT OF A DESIRE TO SHOW THAT I WAS MORE GRIEVED THAN ANY ONE ELSE
I IMAGINE THAT SHE DID THIS TO CHECK HER CONTINUAL SOBBING WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE SPECTATORS I REMEMBER TOO HER TELLING PAPA THE EVENING BEFORE
AND MY IMAGINATION BEGAN TO PICTURE BEFORE ME SCENES OF HER ACTIVE LIFE AND HAPPINESS I FORGOT THAT THE CORPSE LYING BEFORE ME NOW
YET FOR ALL MY ASKING SHE WOULD SAY NO MORE BEYOND COMMANDING ME TO HAND HER THE LETTER TO THAT LETTER SHE ADDED SOMETHING
DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT MY ILLNESS IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY ONE KNOWS I ALONE KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LEAVE MY BED AGAIN DO NOT THEREFORE DELAY A MINUTE IN COMING HERE WITH THE CHILDREN
BUT I HAVE NOT SLEPT NOW FOR THREE NIGHTS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE HER LATER I HEARD FROM NATALIA SAVISHNA WHO PASSED THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH APRIL AT MAMMA'S BEDSIDE THAT AFTER WRITING THE FIRST PART OF THE LETTER
AND ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE OPEN DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM STOOD A GREY OLD WOMAN WITH BENT KNEES WITH HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER AND EYES LIFTED TO HEAVEN SHE PRAYED ONLY NOT WEPT
FOR I FEEL INDEED I KNOW SINCE GOD HAS DEIGNED TO REVEAL IT TO ME THAT I HAVE NOW BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO LIVE WILL MY LOVE FOR YOU AND THE CHILDREN CEASE WITH MY LIFE I KNOW THAT THAT CAN NEVER BE
AND I CAN HEAR HIM TELLING THEM GERMAN STORIES AND THEM LAUGHING AS THEY LISTEN TO HIM LA BELLE FLAMANDE AS YOU CALL HER IS NOW SPENDING HER SECOND WEEK HERE AS MY GUEST HER MOTHER HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT SOMEWHERE
THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I DESPISED MYSELF FOR NOT FEELING GRIEF TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL THE FACT SHOWS THAT MY SADNESS WAS INSINCERE AND UNNATURAL
AT LAST MIMI CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE AND FORCED ME TO RETIRE TO BED THAT WAS HOW MY ILLNESS BEGAN AND IT WAS ALL THROUGH MY OWN FAULT THE NEXT DAY I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FEVER
HE HAS NOT LEFT US SINCE BUT PROMISES SOON TO RESTORE ME TO THE WORLD WHAT A WONDERFUL OLD MAN HE IS
I STOPPED AT THE DOOR AND TRIED TO LOOK BUT MY EYES WERE SO WEAK WITH CRYING AND MY NERVES SO TERRIBLY ON EDGE THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING EVERY OBJECT SEEMED TO MINGLE TOGETHER IN A STRANGE BLUR
THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS TIME I SHALL BE WELL AGAIN AND ABLE TO TAKE THE OPEN AIR AND TO ENJOY THE APRIL SUN NOW AU REVOIR MY DEAREST ONE DO NOT BE ALARMED
THAN I FELT OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN I WAS SO TIRED AND IN THIS WAY HALF AN HOUR PASSED WHILE HELP WAS BEING SENT FOR TO GET THE CARRIAGE DUG OUT I FELT COLD FOR I HAD ONLY THIN BOOTS ON AND THEY HAD BEEN WET THROUGH
I TOOK A DELIGHT IN FEELING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IN TRYING TO FEEL MORE SO CONSEQUENTLY THIS EGOTISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS COMPLETELY ANNULLED ANY ELEMENT OF SINCERITY IN MY WOE
WHILE I WAS FEVERISH AND DELIRIOUS HE SAT THE WHOLE NIGHT BY MY BEDSIDE WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES AND AT THIS MOMENT SINCE HE KNOWS I AM BUSY WRITING HE IS WITH THE GIRLS IN THE DIVANNAIA
AS I STOOD GRAZING AT IT I AT LAST RECOGNISED THE WELL KNOWN BELOVED FEATURES I SHUDDERED WITH HORROR TO REALISE THAT IT WAS SHE WHY WERE THOSE EYES SO SUNKEN
FAREWELL WOLODA FAREWELL MY PET FAREWELL MY BENJAMIN MY LITTLE NICOLINKA SURELY THEY WILL NEVER FORGET ME WITH THIS LETTER HAD COME ALSO A FRENCH NOTE FROM MIMI
LUBOTSHKA HAD MEANT TO WRITE TO YOU HERSELF BUT SHE HAS TORN UP THREE SHEETS OF PAPER SAYING I KNOW WHAT A QUIZZER PAPA ALWAYS IS IF HE WERE TO FIND A SINGLE FAULT IN MY LETTER HE WOULD SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY
I FELT A PANG AT MY HEART WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS AND MY THOUGHTS AT ONCE TURNED TO MAMMA THE CAUSE OF OUR UNEXPECTED DEPARTURE WAS THE FOLLOWING LETTER PETROVSKOE TWELFTH APRIL ONLY THIS MOMENT
WHEREUPON I OPENED MY EYES AND LOOKED AT HER MY DARLING WAS SITTING UP IN BED WITH HER HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER AND STREAMS OF TEARS GUSHING FROM HER EYES IT IS ALL OVER NOW SHE SAID
THE LETTER ON THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL NEARLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DAY JUST DESCRIBED PAPA ENTERED OUR SCHOOLROOM AND TOLD US THAT THAT NIGHT WE MUST START WITH HIM FOR OUR COUNTRY HOUSE
SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THAT SHE IS BETTER OFF NOW SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AND SO ON AWAKENED IN ME SOMETHING LIKE FURY WHAT RIGHT HAD THEY TO WEEP OVER OR TO TALK ABOUT HER
PERHAPS IT MAY YET BE PERMITTED ME TO EMBRACE AND BLESS THEM IT IS MY LAST WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE SO I KNOW WHAT A TERRIBLE BLOW THIS WILL BE TO YOU BUT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HEAR IT SOONER OR LATER IF NOT FROM ME
OF AN INTEREST WHICH I TOOK IN OBSERVING THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON OTHERS BY MY TEARS AND OF AN IDLE CURIOSITY LEADING ME TO REMARK MIMI'S BONNET AND THE FACES OF ALL PRESENT
HITHERTO GOD HAS LISTENED TO MY PRAYERS YOU HAVE NEVER YET OVERSTEPPED THE LIMIT BEYOND WHICH WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED EITHER TO SACRIFICE PROPERTY WHICH WOULD NO LONGER BELONG TO US BUT TO THE CHILDREN OR
THAT MAMMA'S DEATH HAD COME UPON HER AS A BLOW FROM WHICH SHE COULD NEVER HOPE TO RECOVER THAT WITH MAMMA SHE HAD LOST EVERYTHING BUT THAT THE ANGEL AS SHE CALLED MY MOTHER HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HER WHEN AT THE POINT OF DEATH
BUT AS IT WAS LATE HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO MIMI TILL THIS MORNING AND MIMI SINCE I WAS UNWELL KEPT IT FROM ME ALL DAY I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FEVERISH IN FACT TO TELL THE TRUTH
AS STRAINING HER TERRIFIED FACE AWAY SHE STILL CONTINUED TO GAZE WITH DILATED EYES AT THE FACE OF THE CORPSE I TOO SCREAMED IN A VOICE PERHAPS MORE DREADFUL STILL AND RAN HEADLONG FROM THE ROOM
AFTER LUNCHEON TOO I HAD ALTERNATE COLD AND HOT FITS YET STILL CONTINUED TO FOLLOW OUR ORDINARY ROUTINE
UPON DEATH AS NO MORE THAN THE PASSAGE TO A BETTER LIFE YET WHY DO TEARS BLIND MY EYES WHY SHOULD THE CHILDREN LOSE A MOTHER'S LOVE
NOR YET AFTER MY DEATH IF GOD SHOULD SEE FIT TO SEPARATE US SHALL SUCH A THING BE DONE ALSO YOU WRITE THAT OUR AFFAIRS RENDER IT INDISPENSABLE FOR YOU TO VISIT SAINT PETERSBURG THE LORD GO WITH YOU
AND FROM THAT THOUGHT I GLEAN SUCH COMFORT THAT I AWAIT THE APPROACH OF DEATH CALMLY AND WITHOUT FEAR YES I AM CALM AND GOD KNOWS THAT I HAVE EVER LOOKED AND DO LOOK NOW
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OR BOWED UNTIL HE TOUCHED THE FLOOR WITH HIS HAND A CUSTOM OF THE GREEK FUNERAL RITE OR TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE PRIEST OR WENT TO THE COFFIN ALL WERE EXCEEDINGLY EFFECTIVE YET FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER
HE WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AND ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIS TEARS HIS TALL FIGURE IN ITS BLACK FROCKCOAT HIS PALE EXPRESSIVE FACE THE GRACEFUL ASSURED MANNER IN WHICH AS USUAL
HER SOUL WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND SHE WAS ASKING HIM SOON TO REUNITE HER TO HER WHOM SHE HAD LOVED BEYOND ALL BEINGS ON THIS EARTH AND WHOM SHE STEADFASTLY BELIEVED THAT SHE WOULD VERY SOON MEET AGAIN
HAVE I RECEIVED YOUR DEAR LETTER OF THE THIRD OF APRIL BUT AS USUAL I ANSWER IT AT ONCE
I SHALL NOT THINK MUCH OF IT AND YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY I HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO NO LONGER RELYING SO FAR AS THE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED UPON YOUR GAINS AT PLAY NOR YET EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING SO
THAT IT HAD SEEN MY SORROW AND PITYING ME HAD RETURNED TO EARTH ON THE WINGS OF LOVE TO CONSOLE AND BLESS ME WITH A HEAVENLY SMILE OF COMPASSION
AND I KNOW THAT THAT LOVE WILL EXIST FOR EVER SINCE SUCH A FEELING COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AWAKENED IF IT WERE NOT TO BE ETERNAL I SHALL NO LONGER BE WITH YOU YET I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY LOVE WILL CLEAVE TO YOU ALWAYS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A TABLE LAY THE COFFIN WITH WAX CANDLES BURNING ALL ROUND IT ON TALL SILVER CANDELABRA IN THE FURTHER CORNER SAT THE CHANTER READING THE PSALMS IN A LOW MONOTONOUS VOICE
HE HIMSELF HAD NOTHING TO PRODUCE I WAS BACKWARD SEEMED DESIROUS OF BEING EXCUSED
OUR HEREDITARY GOVERNORS WHO WHEN ANY EXPENSE WAS TO BE INCURRED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THEIR PROVINCE WITH INCREDIBLE MEANNESS INSTRUCTED THEIR DEPUTIES TO PASS NO ACT FOR LEVYING THE NECESSARY TAXES
A PRESENT OF A GLASS TUBE WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE USE OF IT IN MAKING SUCH EXPERIMENTS I EAGERLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAD SEEN AT BOSTON
IT IS HANDED TO THE PEOPLE UNDER THE MORE FORMIDABLE SHAPE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST HATH ONLY MADE KINGS MORE SUBTLE NOT MORE JUST
THE PEOPLE ANOTHER THE PEERS ARE AN HOUSE IN BEHALF OF THE KING THE COMMONS IN BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE BUT THIS HATH ALL THE DISTINCTIONS OF AN HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF AND THOUGH THE EXPRESSIONS BE PLEASANTLY ARRANGED
GIVES AFTERWARDS THE KING A POWER TO CHECK THE COMMONS BY EMPOWERING HIM TO REJECT THEIR OTHER BILLS IT AGAIN SUPPOSES THAT THE KING IS WISER THAN THOSE WHOM IT HAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE WISER THAN HIM A MERE ABSURDITY
HOWEVER IT GAVE HIM SO HIGH AN OPINION OF MY ABILITIES IN THE CONFUTING WAY THAT HE SERIOUSLY PROPOSED MY BEING HIS COLLEAGUE IN A PROJECT HE HAD OF SETTING UP A NEW SECT HE WAS TO PREACH THE DOCTRINES AND I WAS TO CONFOUND ALL OPPONENTS
THICK UPON HIS OWN FACE SO THAT FINDING HE WAS LIKELY TO BE NEGROFIED HIMSELF HE AS WELL AS MISTER HAMILTON
AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE GOVERNED HERE THEN IS THE ORIGIN AND RISE OF GOVERNMENT NAMELY A MODE RENDERED NECESSARY BY THE INABILITY OF MORAL VIRTUE TO GOVERN THE WORLD HERE TOO IS THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT VIZ
WHO HAD AN APPARATUS FOR EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY
OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TOOK UP MY CAUSE AND REFUTED HIM
I PROMISE YOU I WILL IF POSSIBLE AVOID THEM HE HAD SOME REASON FOR LOVING TO DISPUTE BEING ELOQUENT
THE FUND FOR PAYING THEM WAS THE INTEREST OF ALL THE PAPER CURRENCY THEN EXTANT IN THE PROVINCE UPON LOAN TOGETHER WITH THE REVENUE ARISING FROM THE EXCISE WHICH BEING KNOWN TO BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
QUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY GOVERNORS
LANGUAGES AND THE DOCTRINE IT CONTAIN'D WAS BY DEGREES UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED BY THE PHILOSOPHERS OF EUROPE IN PREFERENCE TO THAT OF THE ABBE SO THAT HE LIVED TO SEE HIMSELF THE LAST OF HIS SECT
BY A GOVERNMENT WHICH WE MIGHT EXPECT IN A COUNTRY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT OUR CALAMITY IS HEIGHTENED BY REFLECTING THAT WE FURNISH THE MEANS BY WHICH WE SUFFER GOVERNMENT LIKE DRESS IS THE BADGE OF LOST INNOCENCE
CALL HIM A DIFFERENT WAY DISEASE NAY EVEN MISFORTUNE WOULD BE DEATH FOR THOUGH NEITHER MIGHT BE MORTAL YET EITHER WOULD DISABLE HIM FROM LIVING AND REDUCE HIM TO A STATE IN WHICH HE MIGHT RATHER BE SAID TO PERISH THAN TO DIE
HE WAS USUALLY A GREAT GLUTTON AND I PROMISED MYSELF SOME DIVERSION IN HALF STARVING HIM HE AGREED TO TRY THE PRACTICE IF I WOULD KEEP HIM COMPANY I DID SO AND WE HELD IT FOR THREE MONTHS
THO CONSTRAINED TO BEND AT LAST AT LENGTH CAPTAIN DENNY WHO WAS GOVERNOR MORRIS'S SUCCESSOR
EARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA KEIMER AND I LIV'D ON A PRETTY GOOD FAMILIAR FOOTING AND AGREED TOLERABLY WELL FOR HE SUSPECTED NOTHING OF MY SETTING UP
IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX BEING AT BOSTON I MET THERE WITH A DOCTOR SPENCE WHO WAS LATELY ARRIVED FROM SCOTLAND AND SHOW'D ME SOME ELECTRIC EXPERIMENTS THEY WERE IMPERFECTLY PERFORM'D AS HE WAS NOT VERY EXPERT
WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN A PALACE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM BREGETIO WAS RESPECTIVELY INVITED TO APPEAR IN THE CAMP WITH THE SON OF THE DECEASED EMPEROR ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF VALENTINIAN THE INFANT PRINCE OF THE SAME NAME
HE RETAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS OLD ENTHUSIASMS AND LOV'D ARGUMENTATION WE THEREFORE HAD MANY DISPUTATIONS I USED TO WORK HIM SO WITH MY SOCRATIC METHOD
THE MOST COMMON QUESTION WITHOUT ASKING FIRST
IN HIS COMMON CONVERSATION HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO CHOICE OF WORDS HE HESITATES AND BLUNDERS AND YET GOOD GOD HOW HE WRITES
THEY WILL BEGIN TO RELAX IN THEIR DUTY AND ATTACHMENT TO EACH OTHER AND THIS REMISSNESS WILL POINT OUT THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO SUPPLY THE DEFECT OF MORAL VIRTUE SOME CONVENIENT TREE WILL AFFORD THEM A STATE HOUSE
THAT WHATEVER FORM THEREOF APPEARS MOST LIKELY TO ENSURE IT TO US WITH THE LEAST EXPENCE AND GREATEST BENEFIT IS PREFERABLE TO ALL OTHERS IN ORDER TO GAIN A CLEAR AND JUST IDEA OF THE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT
FROM THE EVIDENCE OF REASON AS WELL AS HISTORY THAT THE TWO MARRIAGES OF VALENTINIAN WITH SEVERA AND WITH JUSTINA WERE SUCCESSIVELY CONTRACTED AND THAT HE USED THE ANCIENT PERMISSION OF DIVORCE WHICH WAS STILL ALLOWED BY THE LAWS THOUGH IT WAS CONDEMNED BY THE CHURCH
THAT HE IS SOON OBLIGED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF OF ANOTHER WHO IN HIS TURN REQUIRES THE SAME FOUR OR FIVE UNITED WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE A TOLERABLE DWELLING IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS
ADDING A NUMBER OF NEW ONES I SAY MUCH PRACTICE FOR MY HOUSE WAS CONTINUALLY FULL FOR SOME TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SEE THESE NEW WONDERS
I WILL PRETEND NOT TO HAVE HAD TIME AND SO PRODUCE NOTHING WE SHALL THEN SEE WHAT HE WILL SAY TO IT IT WAS AGREED AND I IMMEDIATELY TRANSCRIB'D IT
WHICH WOULD BE OF MORE USE TO THEM WE PARTED HE GOING TO PHILADELPHIA AND I TO BOSTON IN RETURNING I MET AT NEW YORK WITH THE VOTES OF THE ASSEMBLY BY WHICH IT APPEAR'D THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PROMISE TO ME HE AND THE HOUSE WERE ALREADY IN HIGH CONTENTION
WILL RENDER IT TOO INCONVENIENT FOR ALL OF THEM TO MEET ON EVERY OCCASION AS AT FIRST WHEN THEIR NUMBER WAS SMALL THEIR HABITATIONS NEAR AND THE PUBLIC CONCERNS FEW AND TRIFLING
AND AS THIS FREQUENT INTERCHANGE WILL ESTABLISH A COMMON INTEREST WITH EVERY PART OF THE COMMUNITY THEY WILL MUTUALLY AND NATURALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND ON THIS NOT ON THE UNMEANING NAME OF KING DEPENDS THE STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT
WAS INCAPABLE OF THE MAGNANIMITY WHICH DARES TO ACKNOWLEDGE A FAULT HE FORGOT THE PROVOCATION REMEMBERED ONLY THE INJURY AND ADVANCED INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADI
OR AS THE PHRASE IS CHECK THE RAPIDITY OF ITS MOTION YET SO LONG AS THEY CANNOT STOP IT THEIR ENDEAVORS WILL BE INEFFECTUAL THE FIRST MOVING POWER WILL AT LAST HAVE ITS WAY AND WHAT IT WANTS IN SPEED IS SUPPLIED BY TIME
WE EXCLUDED ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INVENTION BY AGREEING THAT THE TASK SHOULD BE A VERSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH PSALM WHICH DESCRIBES THE DESCENT OF A DEITY WHEN THE TIME OF OUR MEETING DREW NIGH RALPH CALLED ON ME FIRST
AS A BROTHER NOT AS A RIVAL AND ADVISED THE EMPRESS WITH HER SON VALENTINIAN TO FIX THEIR RESIDENCE AT MILAN IN THE FAIR AND PEACEFUL PROVINCE OF ITALY WHILE HE ASSUMED THE MORE ARDUOUS COMMAND OF THE COUNTRIES BEYOND THE ALPS
IN THE PERSONS OF THE PEERS THIRDLY THE NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS IN THE PERSONS OF THE COMMONS ON WHOSE VIRTUE DEPENDS THE FREEDOM OF ENGLAND THE TWO FIRST BY BEING HEREDITARY ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE PEOPLE
WHO THEN RESIDED AT TREVES WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE CALAMITIES OF ILLYRICUM BUT THE LATENESS OF THE SEASON SUSPENDED THE EXECUTION OF HIS DESIGNS TILL THE ENSUING SPRING HE MARCHED IN PERSON
THIS ENGAG'D THE PUBLIC ATTENTION EVERYWHERE
TOO FOND OF CRITICIZING RALPH WAS INGENIOUS GENTEEL IN HIS MANNERS AND EXTREMELY ELOQUENT I THINK I NEVER KNEW A PRETTIER TALKER BOTH OF THEM WERE GREAT ADMIRERS OF POETRY
RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO EMPLOYMENT AS A FACTOR AND IN TIME ACQUIRE WHEREWITH TO TRADE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT I APPROV'D THE AMUSING ONE'S SELF WITH POETRY NOW AND THEN SO FAR AS TO IMPROVE ONE'S LANGUAGE BUT NO FARTHER
FREEDOM AND SECURITY AND HOWEVER OUR EYES MAY BE DAZZLED WITH SNOW OR OUR EARS DECEIVED BY SOUND HOWEVER PREJUDICE MAY WARP OUR WILLS OR INTEREST DARKEN OUR UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLE VOICE OF NATURE AND OF REASON WILL SAY IT IS RIGHT
LET US SUPPOSE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS SETTLED IN SOME SEQUESTERED PART OF THE EARTH UNCONNECTED WITH THE REST
AND THIS HE IS INDUCED TO DO BY THE SAME PRUDENCE WHICH IN EVERY OTHER CASE ADVISES HIM OUT OF TWO EVILS TO CHOOSE THE LEAST WHEREFORE SECURITY BEING THE TRUE DESIGN AND END OF GOVERNMENT IT UNANSWERABLY FOLLOWS
THE STRENGTH OF ONE MAN IS SO UNEQUAL TO HIS WANTS
WHERE THEY WERE NOT AT FIRST THOUGHT WORTH SO MUCH NOTICE AS TO BE PRINTED IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS ONE PAPER WHICH I WROTE FOR MISTER KINNERSLEY
THE LAST A PUNISHER SOCIETY IN EVERY STATE IS A BLESSING BUT GOVERNMENT EVEN IN ITS BEST STATE IS BUT A NECESSARY EVIL IN ITS WORST STATE AN INTOLERABLE ONE FOR WHEN WE SUFFER OR ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME MISERIES
TO BE MANAGED BY A SELECT NUMBER CHOSEN FROM THE WHOLE BODY WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AT STAKE WHICH THOSE HAVE WHO APPOINTED THEM AND WHO WILL ACT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE WHOLE BODY WOULD ACT WERE THEY PRESENT
AND MISTER POWNALL AFTERWARD GOVERNOR POWNALL TO NEW YORK TO SOLICIT ASSISTANCE AS I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY KNEW ITS TEMPER AND WAS MISTER QUINCY'S COUNTRYMAN HE APPLI'D TO ME FOR MY INFLUENCE AND ASSISTANCE
SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY TIRED OF THE PROJECT LONG'D FOR THE FLESH POTS OF EGYPT AND ORDER'D A ROAST PIG HE INVITED ME AND TWO WOMEN FRIENDS TO DINE WITH HIM BUT IT BEING BROUGHT TOO SOON UPON TABLE
UNIFORM AND IRRESISTIBLY OBEYED MAN WOULD NEED NO OTHER LAWGIVER BUT THAT NOT BEING THE CASE HE FINDS IT NECESSARY TO SURRENDER UP A PART OF HIS PROPERTY TO FURNISH MEANS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE REST
BEFORE HE HAD ATTAINED THE NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE THE ROYAL YOUTH RECEIVED FROM THE HANDS OF HIS INDULGENT FATHER THE PURPLE ROBE AND DIADEM
WERE SEASONABLY PREVENTED BY THE WISE AND MODERATE CONDUCT OF THE EMPEROR GRATIAN HE CHEERFULLY ACCEPTED THE CHOICE OF THE ARMY
PARTICULARLY RALPH WHO AS WELL AS COLLINS HAD BEEN UNSETTLED BY ME FOR WHICH THEY BOTH MADE ME SUFFER OSBORNE WAS SENSIBLE CANDID FRANK SINCERE AND AFFECTIONATE TO HIS FRIENDS BUT IN LITERARY MATTERS
THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO SHUT AND LOCK A DOOR AGAINST ABSOLUTE MONARCHY WE AT THE SAME TIME HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PUT THE CROWN IN POSSESSION OF THE KEY THE PREJUDICE OF ENGLISHMEN IN FAVOUR OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT BY KING LORDS AND COMMONS
SO DISTANT FROM ANY POINT WE HAD IN HAND AND YET BY DEGREES LED TO THE POINT AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT AT LAST HE GREW RIDICULOUSLY CAUTIOUS
AND LET ME KNOW HIS PIECE WAS READY I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN BUSY AND HAVING LITTLE INCLINATION HAD DONE NOTHING HE THEN SHOW'D ME HIS PIECE FOR MY OPINION AND I MUCH APPROV'D IT AS IT APPEAR'D TO ME TO HAVE GREAT MERIT
SECONDLY THAT THE COMMONS BY BEING APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE ARE EITHER WISER OR MORE WORTHY OF CONFIDENCE THAN THE CROWN BUT AS THE SAME CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES THE COMMONS A POWER TO CHECK THE KING BY WITHHOLDING THE SUPPLIES
PERHAPS TOO SHE THOUGHT MY EXPECTATIONS NOT SO WELL FOUNDED AS I IMAGINED THEM TO BE MY CHIEF ACQUAINTANCES AT THIS TIME WERE CHARLES OSBORNE JOSEPH WATSON AND JAMES RALPH ALL LOVERS OF READING
THE PALACES OF KINGS ARE BUILT ON THE RUINS OF THE BOWERS OF PARADISE
IT WAS THOUGHT MOST PRUDENT BY HER MOTHER TO PREVENT OUR GOING TOO FAR AT PRESENT AS A MARRIAGE IF IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT AFTER MY RETURN WHEN I SHOULD BE AS I EXPECTED SET UP IN MY BUSINESS
AND THEREFORE I PROPOS'D THAT THE ORDERS SHOULD BE PAYABLE IN A YEAR AND TO BEAR AN INTEREST OF FIVE PER CENT WITH THESE ORDERS I SUPPOS'D THE PROVISIONS MIGHT EASILY BE PURCHAS'D THE ASSEMBLY WITH VERY LITTLE HESITATION ADOPTED THE PROPOSAL THE ORDERS WERE IMMEDIATELY PRINTED
AND WITH THIS MAXIM IN VIEW I OFFER A FEW REMARKS ON THE SO MUCH BOASTED CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND
AND EVERY POLITICAL PHYSICIAN WILL ADVISE A DIFFERENT MEDICINE I KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET OVER LOCAL OR LONG STANDING PREJUDICES YET IF WE WILL SUFFER OURSELVES TO EXAMINE THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
YET WHEN EXAMINED THEY APPEAR IDLE AND AMBIGUOUS AND IT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT THE NICEST CONSTRUCTION THAT WORDS ARE CAPABLE OF WHEN APPLIED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF SOME THING WHICH EITHER CANNOT EXIST OR IS TOO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO BE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF DESCRIPTION
AND DEJECTED COUNTENANCES AND WITHOUT DARING TO COMPLAIN OF THE MURDER OF THEIR KING THEY AFFIRMED WITH SOLEMN OATHS THAT THE LATE INVASION WAS THE CRIME OF SOME IRREGULAR ROBBERS WHICH THE PUBLIC COUNCIL OF THE NATION CONDEMNED AND ABHORRED
HE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND ATE THE WHOLE BEFORE WE CAME
IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE THE OFFICE OF A GUARDIAN WITH THE AUTHORITY OF A SOVEREIGN
DISSEMBLED HIS RESENTMENT TILL HE COULD SAFELY PUNISH OR DISGRACE THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSPIRACY AND THOUGH HE UNIFORMLY BEHAVED WITH TENDERNESS AND REGARD TO HIS INFANT COLLEAGUE HE GRADUALLY CONFOUNDED
NOW SAYS HE OSBORNE NEVER WILL ALLOW THE LEAST MERIT IN ANYTHING OF MINE BUT MAKES ONE THOUSAND CRITICISMS OUT OF MERE ENVY HE IS NOT SO JEALOUS OF YOU I WISH THEREFORE YOU WOULD TAKE THIS PIECE AND PRODUCE IT AS YOURS
UNDERTOOK TO REPEAT WHAT HE CALLED THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENTS AND AFTER THEY WERE PERFORMED BEFORE THE KING AND COURT ALL THE CURIOUS OF PARIS FLOCKED TO SEE THEM I WILL NOT SWELL THIS NARRATIVE WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THAT CAPITAL EXPERIMENT
WE HAD OUR VICTUALS DRESS'D AND BROUGHT TO US REGULARLY BY A WOMAN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAD FROM ME A LIST OF FORTY DISHES TO BE PREPAR'D FOR US AT DIFFERENT TIMES
DURING THIS TIME TO MISS READ I HAD A GREAT RESPECT AND AFFECTION FOR HER AND HAD SOME REASON TO BELIEVE SHE HAD THE SAME FOR ME BUT AS I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND WE WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE EIGHTEEN
ASSUR'D HIM HE HAD NO GENIUS FOR POETRY AND ADVIS'D HIM TO THINK OF NOTHING BEYOND THE BUSINESS HE WAS BRED TO THAT IN THE MERCANTILE WAY THO HE HAD NO STOCK HE MIGHT BY HIS DILIGENCE AND PUNCTUALITY
UNDER THE BRANCHES OF WHICH THE WHOLE COLONY MAY ASSEMBLE TO DELIBERATE ON PUBLIC MATTERS IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THEIR FIRST LAWS WILL HAVE THE TITLE ONLY OF REGULATIONS AND BE ENFORCED BY NO OTHER PENALTY
IS EASILY DEMONSTRATED ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENTS THO THE DISGRACE OF HUMAN NATURE HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE WITH THEM THAT THEY ARE SIMPLE IF THE PEOPLE SUFFER THEY KNOW THE HEAD FROM WHICH THEIR SUFFERING SPRINGS KNOW LIKEWISE THE REMEDY
OR OF THE WORLD IN THIS STATE OF NATURAL LIBERTY SOCIETY WILL BE THEIR FIRST THOUGHT
BELIEVING IT WAS BETTER TO SPEND WHAT TIME I COULD SPARE FROM PUBLIC BUSINESS IN MAKING NEW EXPERIMENTS THAN IN DISPUTING ABOUT THOSE ALREADY MADE I THEREFORE NEVER ANSWERED
THE ANSWER OF THE EMPEROR LEFT THEM
BEFORE I PROCEED IN RELATING THE PART I HAD IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS UNDER THIS NEW GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IT MAY NOT BE AMISS HERE TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF MY PHILOSOPHICAL REPUTATION
CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THEY CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TOWARDS THE FREEDOM OF THE STATE TO SAY THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND IS A UNION OF THREE POWERS RECIPROCALLY CHECKING EACH OTHER IS FARCICAL EITHER THE WORDS HAVE NO MEANING OR THEY ARE
FROM A PRINCIPLE IN NATURE WHICH NO ART CAN OVERTURN VIZ THAT THE MORE SIMPLE ANY THING IS THE LESS LIABLE IT IS TO BE DISORDERED AND THE EASIER REPAIRED WHEN DISORDERED
AND EQUITIUS WHO COMMANDED THE ATTACHMENT OF THE ILLYRIAN AND ITALIAN BANDS THEY CONTRIVED THE MOST HONORABLE PRETENCES
AND DOCTOR FOTHERGILL WROTE THE PREFACE CAVE IT SEEMS JUDGED RIGHTLY FOR HIS PROFIT FOR BY THE ADDITIONS
IMMEDIATELY REVIVED IN THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL AND THE AMBITIOUS DESIGN OF REIGNING IN THE NAME OF AN INFANT WAS ARTFULLY EXECUTED BY
BUT NO EXCUSE COULD BE ADMITTED PRODUCE I MUST
THERE IS SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY RIDICULOUS IN THE COMPOSITION OF MONARCHY IT FIRST EXCLUDES A MAN FROM THE MEANS OF INFORMATION YET EMPOWERS HIM TO ACT IN CASES WHERE THE HIGHEST JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED THE STATE OF A KING SHUTS HIM FROM THE WORLD
HE THOUGHT THEM OF TOO MUCH VALUE TO BE STIFLED AND ADVIS'D THE PRINTING OF THEM MISTER COLLINSON THEN GAVE THEM TO CAVE FOR PUBLICATION IN HIS GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE BUT HE CHOSE TO PRINT THEM SEPARATELY IN A PAMPHLET
WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANY THING WHEN HE HAD FELLED HIS TIMBER HE COULD NOT REMOVE IT NOR ERECT IT AFTER IT WAS REMOVED HUNGER IN THE MEAN TIME WOULD URGE HIM FROM HIS WORK AND EVERY DIFFERENT WANT
OBLIG'D AS WE WERE TO MISTER COLLINSON FOR HIS PRESENT OF THE TUBE ET CETERA I THOUGHT IT RIGHT HE SHOULD BE INFORM'D OF OUR SUCCESS IN USING IT AND WROTE HIM SEVERAL LETTERS CONTAINING ACCOUNTS OF OUR EXPERIMENTS
WHILE THEY REMAINED PERFECTLY JUST TO EACH OTHER BUT AS NOTHING BUT HEAVEN IS IMPREGNABLE TO VICE IT WILL UNAVOIDABLY HAPPEN THAT IN PROPORTION AS THEY SURMOUNT THE FIRST DIFFICULTIES OF EMIGRATION WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER IN A COMMON CAUSE
FOR IN THE COURSE OF MY OBSERVATION THESE DISPUTING CONTRADICTING AND CONFUTING PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY UNFORTUNATE IN THEIR AFFAIRS THEY GET VICTORY SOMETIMES BUT THEY NEVER GET GOOD WILL
IN THIS FIRST PARLIAMENT EVERY MAN BY NATURAL RIGHT WILL HAVE A SEAT BUT AS THE COLONY INCREASES THE PUBLIC CONCERNS WILL INCREASE LIKEWISE AND THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE MEMBERS MAY BE SEPARATED
AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH EXPLANATIONS IN SUCH METHOD
THAT THE CROWN IS THIS OVERBEARING PART IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION NEEDS NOT BE MENTIONED AND THAT IT DERIVES ITS WHOLE CONSEQUENCE MERELY FROM BEING THE GIVER OF PLACES AND PENSIONS IS SELF EVIDENT WHEREFORE
EACH PART SENDING ITS PROPER NUMBER AND THAT THE ELECTED MIGHT NEVER FORM TO THEMSELVES AN INTEREST SEPARATE FROM THE ELECTORS PRUDENCE WILL POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF HAVING ELECTIONS OFTEN BECAUSE AS THE ELECTED
AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS ALSO OF THAT SOCIETY WHO WROTE ME WORD THAT IT HAD BEEN READ BUT WAS LAUGHED AT BY THE CONNOISSEURS THE PAPERS HOWEVER BEING SHOWN TO DOCTOR FOTHERGILL
IN WHICH IT WAS ERECTED IS GRANTED WHEN THE WORLD WAS OVER RUN WITH TYRANNY THE LEAST REMOVE THEREFROM WAS A GLORIOUS RESCUE BUT THAT IT IS IMPERFECT SUBJECT TO CONVULSIONS AND INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING WHAT IT SEEMS TO PROMISE
THE PROPRIETOR WOULD GIVE YOU A GOOD PRICE THE GOVERNOR SAYS I
HE SHOULD EXAMINE AND PRONOUNCE WHEN HE ARRIVED AT SIRMIUM HE GAVE AUDIENCE TO THE DEPUTIES
WHO SEEMED TO UNITE EVERY CLAIM WHICH COULD ENTITLE HIM TO THE UNDOUBTED SUCCESSION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MONARCH WHOSE GLORIOUS REIGN HAD CONFIRMED THE FREE AND HONORABLE CHOICE OF HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS
THE FAVORABLE OPINION OF THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
AND THE TROOPS OF GAUL WHO MIGHT HAVE ASSERTED THE CLAIMS OF THE LAWFUL SUCCESSOR THEY SUGGESTED THE NECESSITY OF EXTINGUISHING THE HOPES OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ENEMIES BY A BOLD AND DECISIVE MEASURE THE EMPRESS JUSTINA
I HAVE SINCE KEPT SEVERAL LENTS MOST STRICTLY LEAVING THE COMMON DIET FOR THAT AND THAT FOR THE COMMON ABRUPTLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE
BUT WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGIN'D SAID HE THAT FRANKLIN HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF SUCH A PERFORMANCE SUCH PAINTING SUCH FORCE SUCH FIRE HE HAS EVEN IMPROV'D THE ORIGINAL
YET THE BUSINESS OF A KING REQUIRES HIM TO KNOW IT THOROUGHLY WHEREFORE THE DIFFERENT PARTS BY UNNATURALLY OPPOSING AND DESTROYING EACH OTHER PROVE THE WHOLE CHARACTER TO BE ABSURD AND USELESS SOME WRITERS HAVE EXPLAINED THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THUS
BUT AGREED TO ADMIT THEM UPON CONDITION OF HIS ADOPTING THE DOCTRINE OF USING NO ANIMAL FOOD I DOUBT SAID HE MY CONSTITUTION WILL NOT BEAR THAT I ASSUR'D HIM IT WOULD
WE SHALL FIND THEM TO BE THE BASE REMAINS OF TWO ANCIENT TYRANNIES COMPOUNDED WITH SOME NEW REPUBLICAN MATERIALS FIRST THE REMAINS OF MONARCHICAL TYRANNY IN THE PERSON OF THE KING SECONDLY THE REMAINS OF ARISTOCRATICAL TYRANNY
SHOULD ASSIST IN COMPREHENDING THE FOLLOWING HE PROCUR'D AN ELEGANT APPARATUS FOR THE PURPOSE IN WHICH ALL THE LITTLE MACHINES THAT I HAD ROUGHLY MADE FOR MYSELF WERE NICELY FORM'D BY INSTRUMENT MAKERS HIS LECTURES
WHEN HE CAME TO EXPLAIN WITH ME UPON THE DOCTRINES I FOUND SEVERAL CONUNDRUMS WHICH I OBJECTED TO UNLESS I MIGHT HAVE MY WAY A LITTLE TOO AND INTRODUCE SOME OF MINE KEIMER WORE HIS BEARD AT FULL LENGTH BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY PROJECTED
AND JOIN'D IN APPLAUDING IT RALPH ONLY MADE SOME CRITICISMS AND PROPOS'D SOME AMENDMENTS BUT I DEFENDED MY TEXT OSBORNE WAS AGAINST RALPH AND TOLD HIM HE WAS NO BETTER A CRITIC THAN POET SO HE DROPT THE ARGUMENT
AS BOTH ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE HISTORIES OF ELECTRICITY
CONVEYANCER IN THE TOWN CHARLES BROCKDEN THE OTHER WAS CLERK TO A MERCHANT WATSON WAS A PIOUS SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY THE OTHERS RATHER MORE LAX IN THEIR PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION
AND THEREFORE GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL IN ARGUMENTATIVE CONVERSATION HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO IT FROM A BOY HIS FATHER AS I HAVE HEARD ACCUSTOMING HIS CHILDREN TO DISPUTE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR HIS DIVERSION
TO DIVIDE A LITTLE THIS INCUMBRANCE AMONG MY FRIENDS I CAUSED A NUMBER OF SIMILAR TUBES TO BE BLOWN AT OUR GLASS HOUSE WITH WHICH THEY FURNISH'D THEMSELVES SO THAT WE HAD AT LENGTH SEVERAL PERFORMERS
WAS FOUNDED IN SIXTEEN SIXTY AND HOLDS THE FOREMOST PLACE AMONG ENGLISH SOCIETIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
WERE WELL ATTENDED AND GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND AFTER SOME TIME HE WENT THRO THE COLONIES EXHIBITING THEM IN EVERY CAPITAL TOWN AND PICK'D UP SOME MONEY
WHO WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD WAS SHOWN IN THE ARMS OF HIS MOTHER TO THE LEGIONS AND SOLEMNLY INVESTED BY MILITARY ACCLAMATION
WE MET WATSON'S PERFORMANCE WAS READ THERE WERE SOME BEAUTIES IN IT BUT MANY DEFECTS OSBORNE'S WAS READ IT WAS MUCH BETTER RALPH DID IT JUSTICE REMARKED SOME FAULTS BUT APPLAUDED THE BEAUTIES
MISTER MORRIS ASK'D ME IF I THOUGHT HE MUST EXPECT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AN ADMINISTRATION I SAID NO YOU MAY ON THE CONTRARY HAVE A VERY COMFORTABLE ONE IF YOU WILL ONLY TAKE CARE
AND IT WAS A CONTINUAL BATTLE BETWEEN THEM AS LONG AS HE RETAIN'D THE GOVERNMENT I HAD MY SHARE OF IT FOR AS SOON AS I GOT BACK TO MY SEAT IN THE ASSEMBLY I WAS PUT ON EVERY COMMITTEE FOR ANSWERING HIS SPEECHES AND MESSAGES
UNLESS THEIR VAST ESTATES WERE IN THE SAME ACT EXPRESSLY EXCUSED AND THEY HAD EVEN TAKEN BONDS OF THESE DEPUTIES TO OBSERVE SUCH INSTRUCTIONS THE ASSEMBLIES FOR THREE YEARS HELD OUT AGAINST THIS INJUSTICE
AND OSBORNE WAS A LITTLE LAUGHED AT THIS TRANSACTION FIXED RALPH IN HIS RESOLUTION OF BECOMING A POET I DID ALL I COULD TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT BUT HE CONTINUED SCRIBBLING VERSES TILL POPE CURED HIM
INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
AND THE SERENE SPIRIT OF THE FLOOD HAS LULLED THEM TO REST YOU MAY THEN CROSS IN SAFETY AND YOU WILL FIND THE WOOLLY GOLD STICKING TO THE BUSHES AND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES THUS THE COMPASSIONATE RIVER GOD GAVE PSYCHE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH HER TASK
SHE ENTERED IT AND IN THE MIDST DISCOVERED A FOUNTAIN SENDING FORTH CLEAR AND CRYSTAL WATERS AND FAST BY A MAGNIFICENT PALACE WHOSE AUGUST FRONT IMPRESSED THE SPECTATOR THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF MORTAL HANDS
AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
ACCORDINGLY ALL THINGS BEING PREPARED THE ROYAL MAID TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION WHICH MORE RESEMBLED A FUNERAL THAN A NUPTIAL POMP AND WITH HER PARENTS AMID THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN
AFTER HER WANDERING LABORS LONG TILL FREE CONSENT THE GODS AMONG MAKE HER HIS ETERNAL BRIDE AND FROM HER FAIR UNSPOTTED SIDE TWO BLISSFUL TWINS ARE TO BE BORN YOUTH AND JOY SO JOVE HATH SWORN
A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
AND NOT ABLE LONGER TO BEAR THE ABSENCE OF HIS BELOVED PSYCHE SLIPPING THROUGH THE SMALLEST CRACK OF THE WINDOW OF HIS CHAMBER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN FLEW TO THE SPOT WHERE PSYCHE LAY
SO SAYING SHE THREW HER A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD FOR HER SUPPER AND WENT AWAY NEXT MORNING VENUS ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE CALLED AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YONDER GROVE WHICH STRETCHES ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE WATER
OF PALE MOUTHED PROPHET DREAMING IN MOORE'S SUMMER FETE A FANCY BALL IS DESCRIBED IN WHICH ONE OF THE CHARACTERS PERSONATED IS PSYCHE NOT IN DARK DISGUISE TO NIGHT HATH OUR YOUNG HEROINE VEILED HER LIGHT
AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
PSYCHE MEANWHILE WANDERED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT FOOD OR REPOSE IN SEARCH OF HER HUSBAND CASTING HER EYES ON A LOFTY MOUNTAIN HAVING ON ITS BROW A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE SHE SIGHED AND SAID TO HERSELF PERHAPS MY LOVE MY LORD INHABITS THERE
NOR VENTURE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE RAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE RISING SUN THEY BURN WITH A CRUEL RAGE TO DESTROY MORTALS WITH THEIR SHARP HORNS OR RUDE TEETH BUT WHEN THE NOONTIDE SUN HAS DRIVEN THE CATTLE TO THE SHADE
AND PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE LOVERS SO EARNESTLY WITH VENUS THAT HE WON HER CONSENT ON THIS HE SENT MERCURY TO BRING PSYCHE UP TO THE HEAVENLY ASSEMBLY AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED HANDING HER A CUP OF AMBROSIA HE SAID DRINK THIS PSYCHE AND BE IMMORTAL
SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
BUT NOW PERFORM EXACTLY THE TASK IMPOSED ON YOU BY MY MOTHER AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST THEN CUPID AS SWIFT AS LIGHTNING PENETRATING THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE JUPITER WITH HIS SUPPLICATION JUPITER LENT A FAVORING EAR
ON THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THEY LEFT HER ALONE AND WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS RETURNED HOME WHILE PSYCHE STOOD ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PANTING WITH FEAR AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS THE GENTLE ZEPHYR RAISED HER FROM THE EARTH
STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
THEN SHE RETURNED THE WAY SHE CAME AND GLAD WAS SHE TO COME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY BUT HAVING GOT SO FAR SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH HER DANGEROUS TASK A LONGING DESIRE SEIZED HER TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX
SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
APPROACHED THE HEAP AND WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TAKING GRAIN BY GRAIN THEY SEPARATED THE PILE SORTING EACH KIND TO ITS PARCEL AND WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THEY VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
AND THAT BRIGHT SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL BIRTH UNTIL HER PINING SOUL AND WEEPING EYES HAD LEARNED TO SEEK HIM ONLY IN THE SKIES TILL WINGS UNTO THE WEARY HEART WERE GIVEN AND SHE BECAME LOVE'S ANGEL BRIDE IN HEAVEN
THERE YOU WILL FIND SHEEP FEEDING WITHOUT A SHEPHERD WITH GOLDEN SHINING FLEECES ON THEIR BACKS GO FETCH ME A SAMPLE OF THAT PRECIOUS WOOL GATHERED FROM EVERY ONE OF THEIR FLEECES
GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE REAL VENUS SHAKING HER AMBROSIAL LOCKS WITH INDIGNATION SHE EXCLAIMED AM I THEN TO BE ECLIPSED IN MY HONORS BY A MORTAL GIRL IN VAIN THEN DID THAT ROYAL SHEPHERD WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS APPROVED BY JOVE HIMSELF
SHE HEARD FAR ECHOES OF THE VOICE OF LOVE AND FOUND HIS FOOTSTEPS TRACES EVERYWHERE BUT NEVERMORE THEY MET SINCE DOUBTS AND FEARS THOSE PHANTOM SHAPES THAT HAUNT AND BLIGHT THE EARTH HAD COME TWIXT HER A CHILD OF SIN AND TEARS
BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
AND BORE HER WITH AN EASY MOTION INTO A FLOWERY DALE BY DEGREES HER MIND BECAME COMPOSED AND SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK TO SLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE
PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
PSYCHE OBEYED THE COMMANDS OF CERES AND TOOK HER WAY TO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS ENDEAVORING TO FORTIFY HER MIND AND RUMINATING ON WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY AND HOW BEST PROPITIATE THE ANGRY GODDESS FEELING THAT THE ISSUE WAS DOUBTFUL AND PERHAPS FATAL
WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
NOR ALTAR HEAPED WITH FLOWERS NOR VIRGIN CHOIR TO MAKE DELICIOUS MOAN UPON THE MIDNIGHT HOURS NO VOICE NO LUTE NO PIPE NO INCENSE SWEET FROM CHAIN SWUNG CENSOR TEEMING NO SHRINE NO GROVE NO ORACLE NO HEAT
SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
BUT AN INFERNAL AND TRULY STYGIAN SLEEP WHICH BEING THUS SET FREE FROM ITS PRISON TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SHE FELL DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE ROAD A SLEEPY CORPSE WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTION BUT CUPID BEING NOW RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND
AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
O LATEST BORN AND LOVELIEST VISION FAR OF ALL OLYMPUS FADED HIERARCHY FAIRER THAN PHOEBE'S SAPPHIRE REGIONED STAR OR VESPER AMOROUS GLOW WORM OF THE SKY FAIRER THAN THESE THOUGH TEMPLE THOU HAST NONE
WHEN TRUTH'S CLEAR RIVER FLOWED O'ER SANDS OF GOLD AND TOLD IN SONG ITS HIGH AND MYSTIC THINGS AND SUCH THE SWEET AND SOLEMN TALE OF HER THE PILGRIM HEART TO WHOM A DREAM WAS GIVEN THAT LED HER THROUGH THE WORLD LOVE'S WORSHIPPER
HE SHED A FEW DROPS FROM THE BITTER FOUNTAIN OVER HER LIPS THOUGH THE SIGHT OF HER ALMOST MOVED HIM TO PITY THEN TOUCHED HER SIDE WITH THE POINT OF HIS ARROW AT THE TOUCH SHE AWOKE AND OPENED EYES UPON CUPID HIMSELF INVISIBLE
PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
TO ENGAGE THEM ALL IN HER BEHALF THE HOLY CERES WHOSE TEMPLE IT WAS FINDING HER SO RELIGIOUSLY EMPLOYED THUS SPOKE TO HER O PSYCHE TRULY WORTHY OF OUR PITY THOUGH I CANNOT SHIELD YOU FROM THE FROWNS OF VENUS
BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
PSYCHE ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADVICE OBEYED IT IN ALL THINGS AND TAKING HEED TO HER WAYS TRAVELLED SAFELY TO THE KINGDOM OF PLUTO SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE PALACE OF PROSERPINE
HER TWO ELDER SISTERS OF MODERATE CHARMS HAD NOW LONG BEEN MARRIED TO TWO ROYAL PRINCES BUT PSYCHE IN HER LONELY APARTMENT DEPLORED HER SOLITUDE SICK OF THAT BEAUTY WHICH WHILE IT PROCURED ABUNDANCE OF FLATTERY HAD FAILED TO AWAKEN LOVE
AND AFTER REPOSE AND THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH SEATED HERSELF IN THE ALCOVE WHERE A TABLE IMMEDIATELY PRESENTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE AID FROM WAITERS OR SERVANTS AND COVERED WITH THE GREATEST DELICACIES OF FOOD AND THE MOST NECTAREOUS WINES
THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS AN EQUAL THAN ADORE ME AS A GOD THIS REASONING SOMEWHAT QUIETED PSYCHE FOR A TIME AND WHILE THE NOVELTY LASTED SHE FELT QUITE HAPPY
THE ALLEGORY OF THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IS WELL PRESENTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LINES OF T K HARVEY THEY WOVE BRIGHT FABLES IN THE DAYS OF OLD WHEN REASON BORROWED FANCY'S PAINTED WINGS
HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
BURSTING ON BRILLIANT WINGS FROM THE TOMB IN WHICH IT HAS LAIN AFTER A DULL GROVELLING CATERPILLAR EXISTENCE TO FLUTTER IN THE BLAZE OF DAY AND FEED ON THE MOST FRAGRANT AND DELICATE PRODUCTIONS OF THE SPRING PSYCHE THEN IS THE HUMAN SOUL
AND A SHARP KNIFE AND HID THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HAD FALLEN INTO HIS FIRST SLEEP SHE SILENTLY ROSE AND UNCOVERING HER LAMP BEHELD NOT A HIDEOUS MONSTER BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING OF THE GODS
THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF APOLLO AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER THE VIRGIN IS DESTINED FOR THE BRIDE OF NO MORTAL LOVER HER FUTURE HUSBAND AWAITS HER ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HE IS A MONSTER WHOM NEITHER GODS NOR MEN CAN RESIST
AND DIRECTED HER STEPS THITHER SHE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN SHE SAW HEAPS OF CORN SOME IN LOOSE EARS AND SOME IN SHEAVES WITH MINGLED EARS OF BARLEY
THEY ASKED HER NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS AMONG OTHERS WHAT SORT OF A PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS PSYCHE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO GENERALLY SPENT THE DAYTIME IN HUNTING UPON THE MOUNTAINS THE SISTERS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY
IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE ALLEGORY MILTON ALLUDES TO THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IN THE CONCLUSION OF HIS COMUS CELESTIAL CUPID HER FAMED SON ADVANCED HOLDS HIS DEAR PSYCHE SWEET ENTRANCED
FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
WITH TWO DEWY WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHITER THAN SNOW AND WITH SHINING FEATHERS LIKE THE TENDER BLOSSOMS OF SPRING AS SHE LEANED THE LAMP OVER TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF HIS FACE A DROP OF BURNING OIL FELL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GOD
BUT THE VOICE ADDED WHEN PROSERPINE HAS GIVEN YOU THE BOX FILLED WITH HER BEAUTY OF ALL THINGS THIS IS CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED BY YOU
THAT STRANGERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAME IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE SIGHT AND LOOKED ON HER WITH AMAZEMENT PAYING HER THAT HOMAGE WHICH IS DUE ONLY TO VENUS HERSELF IN FACT VENUS FOUND HER ALTARS DESERTED
WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
MISCHIEVOUS ENOUGH IN HIS OWN NATURE AND ROUSES AND PROVOKES HIM YET MORE BY HER COMPLAINTS SHE POINTS OUT PSYCHE TO HIM AND SAYS MY DEAR SON PUNISH THAT CONTUMACIOUS BEAUTY GIVE THY MOTHER A REVENGE AS SWEET AS HER INJURIES ARE GREAT
YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
WHILE MEN TURNED THEIR DEVOTION TO THIS YOUNG VIRGIN AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE PEOPLE SANG HER PRAISES AND STREWED HER WAY WITH CHAPLETS AND FLOWERS THIS PERVERSION OF HOMAGE DUE ONLY TO THE IMMORTAL POWERS TO THE EXALTATION OF A MORTAL
CUPID BEHOLDING HER AS SHE LAY IN THE DUST STOPPED HIS FLIGHT FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID O FOOLISH PSYCHE IS IT THUS YOU REPAY MY LOVE AFTER HAVING DISOBEYED MY MOTHER'S COMMANDS AND MADE YOU MY WIFE WILL YOU THINK ME A MONSTER AND CUT OFF MY HEAD
NOR SHALL CUPID EVER BREAK AWAY FROM THE KNOT IN WHICH HE IS TIED BUT THESE NUPTIALS SHALL BE PERPETUAL THUS PSYCHE BECAME AT LAST UNITED TO CUPID AND IN DUE TIME THEY HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO THEM WHOSE NAME WAS PLEASURE
THROUGH THE DIM GROTTO'S TRACERY OF SPARS MID THE PINE TEMPLES ON THE MOONLIT MOUNT WHERE SILENCE SITS TO LISTEN TO THE STARS IN THE DEEP GLADE WHERE DWELLS THE BROODING DOVE THE PAINTED VALLEY AND THE SCENTED AIR
AND SAY MY MISTRESS VENUS DESIRES YOU TO SEND HER A LITTLE OF YOUR BEAUTY FOR IN TENDING HER SICK SON SHE HAS LOST SOME OF HER OWN BE NOT TOO LONG ON YOUR ERRAND FOR I MUST PAINT MYSELF WITH IT TO APPEAR AT THE CIRCLE OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES THIS EVENING
PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE
THE FABLE OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IS USUALLY CONSIDERED ALLEGORICAL THE GREEK NAME FOR A BUTTERFLY IS PSYCHE AND THE SAME WORD MEANS THE SOUL THERE IS NO ILLUSTRATION OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE BUTTERFLY
AND AT HER TABLE AND TO SHOW THEM ALL HER TREASURES THE VIEW OF THESE CELESTIAL DELIGHTS CAUSED ENVY TO ENTER THEIR BOSOMS AT SEEING THEIR YOUNG SISTER POSSESSED OF SUCH STATE AND SPLENDOR SO MUCH EXCEEDING THEIR OWN
WHICH IS PURIFIED BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNES AND IS THUS PREPARED FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF TRUE AND PURE HAPPINESS IN WORKS OF ART PSYCHE IS REPRESENTED AS A MAIDEN WITH THE WINGS OF A BUTTERFLY ALONG WITH CUPID
THIS DREADFUL DECREE OF THE ORACLE FILLED ALL THE PEOPLE WITH DISMAY AND HER PARENTS ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO GRIEF BUT PSYCHE SAID WHY MY DEAR PARENTS DO YOU NOW LAMENT ME
YET I CAN TEACH YOU HOW BEST TO ALLAY HER DISPLEASURE GO THEN AND VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER YOURSELF TO YOUR LADY AND SOVEREIGN AND TRY BY MODESTY AND SUBMISSION TO WIN HER FORGIVENESS AND PERHAPS HER FAVOR WILL RESTORE YOU THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE LOST
FOR IT WAS HIS PLEASURE FOR THE BEST OF REASONS TO KEEP CONCEALED WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO BEHOLD ME HE SAID HAVE YOU ANY DOUBT OF MY LOVE HAVE YOU ANY WISH UNGRATIFIED IF YOU SAW ME PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEAR ME PERHAPS ADORE ME
AND WHAT COWARDICE MAKES THEE SINK UNDER THIS LAST DANGER WHO HAST BEEN SO MIRACULOUSLY SUPPORTED IN ALL THY FORMER THEN THE VOICE TOLD HER HOW BY A CERTAIN CAVE SHE MIGHT REACH THE REALMS OF PLUTO AND HOW TO AVOID ALL THE DANGERS OF THE ROAD
WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
PREYED ON HER MIND AND MADE HER BEGIN TO FEEL HER PALACE AS BUT A SPLENDID PRISON WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME ONE NIGHT SHE TOLD HIM HER DISTRESS AND AT LAST DREW FROM HIM AN UNWILLING CONSENT THAT HER SISTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE HER
WHERE WAS LAID UP A GREAT QUANTITY OF WHEAT BARLEY MILLET VETCHES BEANS AND LENTILS PREPARED FOR FOOD FOR HER PIGEONS AND SAID TAKE AND SEPARATE ALL THESE GRAINS PUTTING ALL OF THE SAME KIND IN A PARCEL BY THEMSELVES
FOR SEE SHE WALKS THE EARTH LOVE'S OWN HIS WEDDED BRIDE BY HOLIEST VOW PLEDGED IN OLYMPUS AND MADE KNOWN TO MORTALS BY THE TYPE WHICH NOW HANGS GLITTERING ON HER SNOWY BROW
AND WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE DELICATE SEAT OR DELICIOUS BANQUET THAT WAS OFFERED HER BUT CONTENTED WITH COARSE BREAD FOR HER FOOD SHE DELIVERED HER MESSAGE FROM VENUS PRESENTLY THE BOX WAS RETURNED TO HER SHUT AND FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS COMMODITY
BY SEPARATING AND SORTING EVERYTHING TO ITS PROPER PLACE AND KIND
PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
RETIRE THEREFORE TO YOUR CHAMBER AND REPOSE ON YOUR BED OF DOWN AND WHEN YOU SEE FIT REPAIR TO THE BATH SUPPER AWAITS YOU IN THE ADJOINING ALCOVE WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT THERE PSYCHE GAVE EAR TO THE ADMONITIONS OF HER VOCAL ATTENDANTS
VERY TRUE I SAID BUT IMAGINE ONE OF THESE OWNERS THE MASTER SAY OF SOME FIFTY SLAVES TOGETHER WITH HIS FAMILY AND PROPERTY AND SLAVES CARRIED OFF BY A GOD INTO THE WILDERNESS
AND CARES LESS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS FOR GAIN OR FAME FAR LESS LOVER OF WISDOM LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE ARE TITLES WHICH WE MAY FITLY APPLY TO THAT PART OF THE SOUL CERTAINLY
AND IS TRULY POOR IF YOU KNOW HOW TO INSPECT THE WHOLE SOUL OF HIM
LIKE THE STATE HAS BEEN DIVIDED BY US INTO THREE PRINCIPLES THE DIVISION MAY I THINK FURNISH A NEW DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT NATURE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO THESE THREE PRINCIPLES THREE PLEASURES CORRESPOND
NOT SO FAR INDEED FROM THE HEAVEN OF PLEASURE DOES HE NOT CALL THE OTHER PLEASURES NECESSARY UNDER THE IDEA THAT IF THERE WERE NO NECESSITY FOR THEM HE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THEM THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT HE REPLIED SINCE THEN
AND THAT HE MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE AS MISERABLE AS HIMSELF NO MAN OF ANY SENSE WILL DISPUTE YOUR WORDS COME THEN I SAID AND AS THE GENERAL UMPIRE IN THEATRICAL CONTESTS PROCLAIMS THE RESULT DO YOU ALSO DECIDE
ASSISTED BY THE INFATUATION OF THE PEOPLE THEY CHOOSE FROM AMONG THEMSELVES THE ONE WHO HAS MOST OF THE TYRANT IN HIS OWN SOUL AND HIM THEY CREATE THEIR TYRANT YES HE SAID AND HE WILL BE THE MOST FIT TO BE A TYRANT IF THE PEOPLE YIELD
SUPPOSE WE CALL IT THE CONTENTIOUS OR AMBITIOUS WOULD THE TERM BE SUITABLE EXTREMELY SUITABLE ON THE OTHER HAND EVERY ONE SEES THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF KNOWLEDGE IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE TRUTH
HE MUST NOT BE LIKE A CHILD WHO LOOKS AT THE OUTSIDE AND IS DAZZLED AT THE POMPOUS ASPECT WHICH THE TYRANNICAL NATURE ASSUMES TO THE BEHOLDER BUT LET HIM BE ONE WHO HAS A CLEAR INSIGHT MAY I SUPPOSE THAT THE JUDGMENT IS GIVEN IN THE HEARING OF US ALL
CERTAINLY NOT AND IS THERE ANY MAN IN WHOM YOU WILL FIND MORE OF THIS SORT OF MISERY THAN IN THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHO IS IN A FURY OF PASSIONS AND DESIRES IMPOSSIBLE REFLECTING UPON THESE AND SIMILAR EVILS
IN WHICH THE MERE REST AND CESSATION OF PAIN AND NOT ANY POSITIVE ENJOYMENT IS EXTOLLED BY THEM AS THE GREATEST PLEASURE YES HE SAID AT THE TIME THEY ARE PLEASED AND WELL CONTENT TO BE AT REST AGAIN
AND IF HE FAILS THEN HE WILL USE FORCE AND PLUNDER THEM YES PROBABLY AND IF THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN WHAT THEN MY FRIEND
AND NOW COMES THE THIRD TRIAL WHICH IS DEDICATED TO OLYMPIAN ZEUS THE SAVIOUR A SAGE WHISPERS IN MY EAR THAT NO PLEASURE EXCEPT THAT OF THE WISE IS QUITE TRUE AND PURE ALL OTHERS ARE A SHADOW ONLY AND SURELY THIS WILL PROVE THE GREATEST AND MOST DECISIVE OF FALLS
NO QUESTION ALSO THEY ARE UTTERLY UNJUST IF WE WERE RIGHT IN OUR NOTION OF JUSTICE YES HE SAID AND WE WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT LET US THEN SUM UP IN A WORD I SAID THE CHARACTER OF THE WORST MAN
HE BECOMES AND IS OF NECESSITY MORE JEALOUS MORE FAITHLESS MORE UNJUST MORE FRIENDLESS MORE IMPIOUS THAN HE WAS AT FIRST HE IS THE PURVEYOR AND CHERISHER OF EVERY SORT OF VICE
EVEN IF THE PERPETRATORS OF THEM ARE FEW IN NUMBER YES I SAID BUT SMALL AND GREAT ARE COMPARATIVE TERMS AND ALL THESE THINGS IN THE MISERY AND EVIL WHICH THEY INFLICT UPON A STATE DO NOT COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TYRANT
WHO HAS WISDOM AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY FURTHER THE VERY FACULTY WHICH IS THE INSTRUMENT OF JUDGMENT IS NOT POSSESSED BY THE COVETOUS OR AMBITIOUS MAN BUT ONLY BY THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT FACULTY
FIRST AND MOST INDISPENSABLE OF FRIENDS FOR THE SAKE OF SOME NEWLY FOUND BLOOMING YOUTH WHO IS THE REVERSE OF INDISPENSABLE YES INDEED HE SAID I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD TRULY THEN I SAID
A TYRANNICAL SON IS A BLESSING TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE IS INDEED HE REPLIED
ALSO THREE DESIRES AND GOVERNING POWERS HOW DO YOU MEAN HE SAID THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE WITH WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING A MAN LEARNS ANOTHER WITH WHICH HE IS ANGRY THE THIRD
YOU WOULD ALLOW I SAID THAT THERE IS IN NATURE AN UPPER AND LOWER AND MIDDLE REGION I SHOULD AND IF A PERSON WERE TO GO FROM THE LOWER TO THE MIDDLE REGION WOULD HE NOT IMAGINE THAT HE IS GOING UP
THEN THE PRAISE OR BLAME OF THE LOVER OF GAIN WOULD SURELY BE THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ASSUREDLY OR IF HONOUR OR VICTORY OR COURAGE IN THAT CASE THE JUDGMENT OF THE AMBITIOUS OR PUGNACIOUS WOULD BE THE TRUEST
HE IS DRAWN INTO A PERFECTLY LAWLESS LIFE WHICH BY HIS SEDUCERS IS TERMED PERFECT LIBERTY AND HIS FATHER AND FRIENDS TAKE PART WITH HIS MODERATE DESIRES AND THE OPPOSITE PARTY ASSIST THE OPPOSITE ONES
AND YOU MUST CONCEIVE THIS MAN SUCH AS HE IS TO HAVE A SON WHO IS BROUGHT UP IN HIS FATHER'S PRINCIPLES I CAN IMAGINE HIM THEN YOU MUST FURTHER IMAGINE THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO THE SON WHICH HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO THE FATHER
BECAUSE SUCH DESIRES ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED BY THE HELP OF MONEY THAT IS TRUE HE SAID IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT THE LOVES AND PLEASURES OF THIS THIRD PART WERE CONCERNED WITH GAIN WE SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO FALL BACK ON A SINGLE NOTION AND MIGHT TRULY
BREAKS OUT INTO A FRENZY AND IF HE FINDS IN HIMSELF ANY GOOD OPINIONS OR APPETITES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND THERE IS IN HIM ANY SENSE OF SHAME REMAINING TO THESE BETTER PRINCIPLES HE PUTS AN END
THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE I SAID AS TO WHICH IS WHICH AND THEREFORE I WILL AT ONCE ENQUIRE WHETHER YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT A SIMILAR DECISION ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE HAPPINESS AND MISERY
AND NOW I SAID
OR THOSE WHOM HE HIMSELF HAS ALLOWED TO BREAK LOOSE WITHIN HIM BY REASON OF A SIMILAR EVIL NATURE IN HIMSELF HAVE WE NOT HERE A PICTURE OF HIS WAY OF LIFE YES INDEED HE SAID AND IF THERE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THEM IN THE STATE
A MAN MAY NOT BE READY TO COMMIT MOST TRUE HE SAID BUT WHEN A MAN'S PULSE IS HEALTHY AND TEMPERATE AND WHEN BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP HE HAS AWAKENED HIS RATIONAL POWERS AND FED THEM ON NOBLE THOUGHTS AND ENQUIRIES
LOVERS OF HONOUR LOVERS OF GAIN EXACTLY AND THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF PLEASURE WHICH ARE THEIR SEVERAL OBJECTS VERY TRUE NOW
BE ALSO THE MOST MISERABLE AND HE WHO HAS TYRANNIZED LONGEST AND MOST MOST CONTINUALLY AND TRULY MISERABLE ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THE OPINION OF MEN IN GENERAL YES HE SAID INEVITABLY AND MUST NOT THE TYRANNICAL MAN
WAS JUST NOW SHOWN TO BE REST AND NOT MOTION AND IN A MEAN BETWEEN THEM YES HOW THEN CAN WE BE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT THE ABSENCE OF PAIN IS PLEASURE OR THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS PAIN
OR IF THEY WANT ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY THEY IN THEIR TURN ARE EQUALLY READY TO BOW DOWN BEFORE THEM
THAT IS CERTAIN YES AND EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT DESIRES GROW UP MANY AND FORMIDABLE AND THEIR DEMANDS ARE MANY THEY ARE INDEED HE SAID HIS REVENUES IF HE HAS ANY ARE SOON SPENT
WHEN PLEASURE CEASES THAT SORT OF REST OR CESSATION WILL BE PAINFUL DOUBTLESS HE SAID THEN THE INTERMEDIATE STATE OF REST WILL BE PLEASURE AND WILL ALSO BE PAIN SO IT WOULD SEEM
TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE PLEASURES OF SMELL WHICH ARE VERY GREAT AND HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS THEY COME IN A MOMENT AND WHEN THEY DEPART LEAVE NO PAIN BEHIND THEM MOST TRUE HE SAID LET US NOT THEN
BUT ALSO OVER THE GODS THAT HE WILL AND THE TYRANNICAL MAN IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD COMES INTO BEING WHEN EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NATURE OR HABIT OR BOTH HE BECOMES DRUNKEN LUSTFUL
WHEN AFTER PACIFYING THE TWO IRRATIONAL PRINCIPLES HE ROUSES UP THE THIRD WHICH IS REASON BEFORE HE TAKES HIS REST THEN AS YOU KNOW HE ATTAINS TRUTH MOST NEARLY AND IS LEAST LIKELY TO BE THE SPORT OF FANTASTIC AND LAWLESS VISIONS
HE HAS TO BE MASTER OF OTHERS WHEN HE IS NOT MASTER OF HIMSELF
AND BEEN PRESENT AT HIS DALLY LIFE AND KNOWN HIM IN HIS FAMILY RELATIONS WHERE HE MAY BE SEEN STRIPPED OF HIS TRAGEDY ATTIRE AND AGAIN IN THE HOUR OF PUBLIC DANGER HE SHALL TELL US ABOUT THE HAPPINESS AND MISERY OF THE TYRANT WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER MEN
AS A TYRANT LEADS A STATE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY RECKLESS DEED BY WHICH HE CAN MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND THE RABBLE OF HIS ASSOCIATES
THEN THIS I SAID WILL BE OUR FIRST PROOF AND THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH MAY ALSO HAVE SOME WEIGHT WHAT IS THAT THE SECOND PROOF IS DERIVED FROM THE NATURE OF THE SOUL SEEING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
BUT ALL THESE REPRESENTATIONS WHEN TRIED BY THE TEST OF TRUE PLEASURE ARE NOT REAL BUT A SORT OF IMPOSITION THAT IS THE INFERENCE LOOK AT THE OTHER CLASS OF PLEASURES WHICH HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS
ARE MISERABLY DEGRADED AND ENSLAVED THEN IF THE MAN IS LIKE THE STATE I SAID MUST NOT THE SAME RULE PREVAIL HIS SOUL IS FULL OF MEANNESS AND VULGARITY THE BEST ELEMENTS IN HIM ARE ENSLAVED AND THERE IS A SMALL RULING PART WHICH IS ALSO THE WORST AND MADDEST
I QUITE AGREE IN SAYING THIS I HAVE BEEN RUNNING INTO A DIGRESSION BUT THE POINT WHICH I DESIRE TO NOTE IS THAT IN ALL OF US EVEN IN GOOD MEN THERE IS A LAWLESS WILD BEAST NATURE WHICH PEERS OUT IN SLEEP PRAY
AND ALL THE PLEASURES OF A DISSOLUTE LIFE NOW LET LOOSE COME BUZZING AROUND HIM NOURISHING TO THE UTMOST THE STING OF DESIRE WHICH THEY IMPLANT IN HIS DRONE LIKE NATURE THEN AT LAST THIS LORD OF THE SOUL HAVING MADNESS FOR THE CAPTAIN OF HIS GUARD
AND THE STATE WHICH IS ENSLAVED UNDER A TYRANT IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF ACTING VOLUNTARILY UTTERLY INCAPABLE
WHO ENCOURAGED THE SAVING APPETITES IN HIM BUT DISCOUNTENANCED THE UNNECESSARY WHICH AIM ONLY AT AMUSEMENT AND ORNAMENT TRUE AND THEN HE GOT INTO THE COMPANY OF A MORE REFINED LICENTIOUS SORT OF PEOPLE
THEN COMPARING OUR ORIGINAL CITY WHICH WAS UNDER A KING AND THE CITY WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT HOW DO THEY STAND AS TO VIRTUE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE EXTREMES HE SAID FOR ONE IS THE VERY BEST AND THE OTHER IS THE VERY WORST
HE WILL COMMIT THE FOULEST MURDER OR EAT FORBIDDEN FOOD OR BE GUILTY OF ANY OTHER HORRID ACT LOVE IS HIS TYRANT AND LIVES LORDLY IN HIM AND LAWLESSLY AND BEING HIMSELF A KING LEADS HIM ON
BUT CAN THAT WHICH IS NEITHER BECOME BOTH I SHOULD SAY NOT AND BOTH PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE MOTIONS OF THE SOUL ARE THEY NOT YES BUT THAT WHICH IS NEITHER
AND YOU WILL NO LONGER SUPPOSE AS YOU PERHAPS MAY AT PRESENT THAT PLEASURE IS ONLY THE CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE WHAT ARE THEY HE SAID AND WHERE SHALL I FIND THEM THERE ARE MANY OF THEM
WHO IS NEARER TO HIMSELF THAN THE MONEY MAKER LAST COMES THE LOVER OF GAIN VERY TRUE HE SAID TWICE IN SUCCESSION THEN HAS THE JUST MAN OVERTHROWN THE UNJUST IN THIS CONFLICT
FURTHER I SAID HAS NOT A DRUNKEN MAN ALSO THE SPIRIT OF A TYRANT HE HAS AND YOU KNOW THAT A MAN WHO IS DERANGED AND NOT RIGHT IN HIS MIND WILL FANCY THAT HE IS ABLE TO RULE NOT ONLY OVER MEN
NAY HE SAID I SHOULD NOT FEEL AT ALL COMFORTABLE ABOUT HIS PARENTS BUT O HEAVENS ADEIMANTUS ON ACCOUNT OF SOME NEW FANGLED LOVE OF A HARLOT WHO IS ANYTHING BUT A NECESSARY CONNECTION CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD STRIKE THE MOTHER
FOR HE HAS A DOUBLE EXPERIENCE YES VERY GREAT AGAIN HAS HE GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR OR THE LOVER OF HONOUR OF THE PLEASURES OF WISDOM NAY HE SAID
AND HOW DOES HE LIVE IN HAPPINESS OR IN MISERY YES HE SAID HE IS THE ONLY ONE REMAINING THERE IS HOWEVER I SAID A PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH REMAINS UNANSWERED WHAT QUESTION
WHAT SORT OF MISCHIEF FOR EXAMPLE
REASON WITH WHOM AS WE WERE SAYING
OF THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THE PLEASURES WHICH WE ENUMERATED HAS THE LOVER OF GAIN IN LEARNING THE NATURE OF ESSENTIAL TRUTH GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE THAN THE PHILOSOPHER HAS OF THE PLEASURE OF GAIN
WHEN HE WAS STILL SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND TO HIS FATHER WERE ONLY LET LOOSE IN THE DREAMS OF SLEEP BUT NOW THAT HE IS UNDER THE DOMINION OF LOVE
AND LED A LIFE NOT OF VULGAR AND SLAVISH PASSION BUT OF WHAT HE DEEMED MODERATE INDULGENCE IN VARIOUS PLEASURES AFTER THIS MANNER THE DEMOCRAT WAS GENERATED OUT OF THE OLIGARCH YES HE SAID THAT WAS OUR VIEW OF HIM AND IS SO STILL
AND INTELLIGIBLY DESCRIBE THIS PART OF THE SOUL AS LOVING GAIN OR MONEY I AGREE WITH YOU AGAIN IS NOT THE PASSIONATE ELEMENT WHOLLY SET ON RULING AND CONQUERING AND GETTING FAME TRUE
CLEARLY BUT SINCE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE JUDGES THE ONLY INFERENCE POSSIBLE HE REPLIED IS THAT PLEASURES WHICH ARE APPROVED BY THE LOVER OF WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE TRUEST
BUT FIGHTING AND COMBATING WITH OTHER MEN YES HE SAID THE SIMILITUDE IS MOST EXACT IS NOT HIS CASE UTTERLY MISERABLE AND DOES NOT THE ACTUAL TYRANT LEAD A WORSE LIFE THAN HE WHOSE LIFE YOU DETERMINED TO BE THE WORST
I DO NOT THINK THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY DETERMINED THE NATURE AND NUMBER OF THE APPETITES AND UNTIL THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THE ENQUIRY WILL ALWAYS BE CONFUSED WELL HE SAID IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SUPPLY THE OMISSION
AND SO WE ARRIVE AT THE RESULT THAT THE PLEASURE OF THE INTELLIGENT PART OF THE SOUL IS THE PLEASANTEST OF THE THREE AND THAT HE OF US IN WHOM THIS IS THE RULING PRINCIPLE HAS THE PLEASANTEST LIFE
INEVITABLY AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SOUL OF SUCH AN ONE IS THE SOUL OF A FREEMAN OR OF A SLAVE HE HAS THE SOUL OF A SLAVE IN MY OPINION
AND HE WHO IS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE AND SEES WHENCE HE HAS COME WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE IS ALREADY IN THE UPPER REGION IF HE HAS NEVER SEEN THE TRUE UPPER WORLD TO BE SURE HE SAID HOW CAN HE THINK OTHERWISE
AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE WELL DISPOSED THEY GO AWAY AND BECOME THE BODY GUARD OR MERCENARY SOLDIERS OF SOME OTHER TYRANT WHO MAY PROBABLY WANT THEM FOR A WAR AND IF THERE IS NO WAR THEY STAY AT HOME AND DO MANY LITTLE PIECES OF MISCHIEF IN THE CITY
WHAT SHOULD THEY FEAR NOTHING BUT DO YOU OBSERVE THE REASON OF THIS YES THE REASON IS THAT THE WHOLE CITY IS LEAGUED TOGETHER FOR THE PROTECTION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE LAWS AND BY REASON AND THE BETTER DESIRES PREVAIL OVER THEM EITHER THEY ARE WHOLLY BANISHED OR THEY BECOME FEW AND WEAK WHILE IN THE CASE OF OTHERS THEY ARE STRONGER AND THERE ARE MORE OF THEM WHICH APPETITES DO YOU MEAN
YES I KNOW HE SAID AND WHEN PERSONS ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE PAIN YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THEM SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING PLEASANTER THAN TO GET RID OF THEIR PAIN I HAVE AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES OF SUFFERING
BE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT PURE PLEASURE IS THE CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE NO STILL THE MORE NUMEROUS AND VIOLENT PLEASURES WHICH REACH THE SOUL THROUGH THE BODY ARE GENERALLY OF THIS SORT THEY ARE RELIEFS OF PAIN
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS AS YET REACHED THE UTMOST EXTREME OF MISERY THEN WHO IS MORE MISERABLE
TRUE AND THERE IS A NEUTRAL STATE WHICH IS NEITHER PLEASURE NOR PAIN THERE IS A STATE WHICH IS INTERMEDIATE AND A SORT OF REPOSE OF THE SOUL ABOUT EITHER THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN
AS SOON AS THESE DIRE MAGICIANS AND TYRANT MAKERS FIND THAT THEY ARE LOSING THEIR HOLD ON HIM THEY CONTRIVE TO IMPLANT IN HIM A MASTER PASSION TO BE LORD OVER HIS IDLE AND SPENDTHRIFT LUSTS A SORT OF MONSTROUS WINGED DRONE
I SHOULD RATHER SAY EVEN HAD HE DESIRED COULD HARDLY HAVE TASTED THE SWEETNESS OF LEARNING AND KNOWING TRUTH
THE BEST HAS DECIDED THAT THE BEST AND JUSTEST IS ALSO THE HAPPIEST AND THAT THIS IS HE WHO IS THE MOST ROYAL MAN AND KING OVER HIMSELF AND THAT THE WORST AND MOST UNJUST MAN
THAT AGAIN HE SAID IS A VERY FAIR PROPOSAL
MUST BE ALWAYS POOR AND INSATIABLE TRUE AND MUST NOT SUCH A STATE AND SUCH A MAN BE ALWAYS FULL OF FEAR YES INDEED IS THERE ANY STATE IN WHICH YOU WILL FIND MORE OF LAMENTATION AND SORROW AND GROANING AND PAIN
YES AND REASONING IS PECULIARLY HIS INSTRUMENT CERTAINLY IF WEALTH AND GAIN WERE THE CRITERION
YOU HELD THE TYRANNICAL STATE TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF STATES AND I WAS RIGHT HE SAID CERTAINLY I SAID AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SAME EVILS IN THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHAT DO YOU SAY OF HIM
CONSIDER WHETHER I AM RIGHT AND YOU AGREE WITH ME YES I AGREE AND NOW REMEMBER THE CHARACTER WHICH WE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC MAN HE WAS SUPPOSED FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARDS TO HAVE BEEN TRAINED UNDER A MISERLY PARENT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED BEGINNING WITH THE STATE I REPLIED WOULD YOU SAY THAT A CITY WHICH IS GOVERNED BY A TYRANT IS FREE OR ENSLAVED NO CITY HE SAID CAN BE MORE COMPLETELY ENSLAVED AND YET AS YOU SEE
AND TRULY IMAGINE THAT HE WAS DESCENDING NO DOUBT ALL THAT WOULD ARISE OUT OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE UPPER AND MIDDLE AND LOWER REGIONS
WHO IS HIS ANCIENT FRIEND AND NECESSARY TO HIS VERY EXISTENCE AND WOULD PLACE HER UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE OTHER WHEN SHE IS BROUGHT UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HER OR THAT UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD DO THE SAME TO HIS WITHERED OLD FATHER
VERY TRUE I SAID AND OBSERVE THE POINT WHICH I WANT TO UNDERSTAND CERTAIN OF THE UNNECESSARY PLEASURES AND APPETITES I CONCEIVE TO BE UNLAWFUL EVERY ONE APPEARS TO HAVE THEM BUT IN SOME PERSONS
HE IS THE WAKING REALITY OF WHAT WE DREAMED MOST TRUE AND THIS IS HE WHO BEING BY NATURE MOST OF A TYRANT BEARS RULE AND THE LONGER HE LIVES THE MORE OF A TYRANT HE BECOMES THAT IS CERTAIN SAID GLAUCON TAKING HIS TURN TO ANSWER
ALL THREE ARE HONOURED IN PROPORTION AS THEY ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT FOR THE RICH MAN AND THE BRAVE MAN AND THE WISE MAN ALIKE HAVE THEIR CROWD OF ADMIRERS AND AS THEY ALL RECEIVE HONOUR THEY ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR
AND TAKING TO ALL THEIR WANTON WAYS RUSHED INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME FROM AN ABHORRENCE OF HIS FATHER'S MEANNESS AT LAST BEING A BETTER MAN THAN HIS CORRUPTORS HE WAS DRAWN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM IN ALL THEY ARE THE ROYAL TIMOCRATICAL OLIGARCHICAL DEMOCRATICAL TYRANNICAL THE DECISION WILL BE EASILY GIVEN HE REPLIED THEY SHALL BE CHORUSES COMING ON THE STAGE
THIS IS THE END OF HIS PASSIONS AND DESIRES EXACTLY WHEN SUCH MEN ARE ONLY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND BEFORE THEY GET POWER THIS IS THEIR CHARACTER THEY ASSOCIATE ENTIRELY WITH THEIR OWN FLATTERERS OR READY TOOLS
AND BROUGHT IN MADNESS TO THE FULL YES HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE TYRANNICAL MAN IS GENERATED AND IS NOT THIS THE REASON WHY OF OLD LOVE HAS BEEN CALLED A TYRANT I SHOULD NOT WONDER
THERE ARE FREEMEN AS WELL AS MASTERS IN SUCH A STATE YES HE SAID I SEE THAT THERE ARE A FEW
HAVING MANY FORMS HAS NO SPECIAL NAME BUT IS DENOTED BY THE GENERAL TERM APPETITIVE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND VEHEMENCE OF THE DESIRES OF EATING AND DRINKING AND THE OTHER SENSUAL APPETITES WHICH ARE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF IT ALSO MONEY LOVING
AND I MUST JUDGE THEM IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ENTER BY THE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND VICE HAPPINESS AND MISERY NEED WE HIRE A HERALD OR SHALL I ANNOUNCE THAT THE SON OF ARISTON
PASSIONATE O MY FRIEND IS NOT THAT SO ASSUREDLY SUCH IS THE MAN AND SUCH IS HIS ORIGIN AND NEXT HOW DOES HE LIVE SUPPOSE AS PEOPLE FACETIOUSLY SAY YOU WERE TO TELL ME
UNQUESTIONABLY HE SAID THE WISE MAN SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY WHEN HE APPROVES OF HIS OWN LIFE AND WHAT DOES THE JUDGE AFFIRM TO BE THE LIFE WHICH IS NEXT AND THE PLEASURE WHICH IS NEXT
BUT THE DELIGHT WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE BEING IS KNOWN TO THE PHILOSOPHER ONLY HIS EXPERIENCE THEN WILL ENABLE HIM TO JUDGE BETTER THAN ANY ONE FAR BETTER AND HE IS THE ONLY ONE
YES I REPLIED BUT IN THIS HIGH ARGUMENT YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CERTAIN AND SHOULD NOT CONJECTURE ONLY FOR OF ALL QUESTIONS THIS RESPECTING GOOD AND EVIL IS THE GREATEST VERY TRUE
THAT IS TRUE AND THE ANTICIPATIONS OF FUTURE PLEASURES AND PAINS ARE OF A LIKE NATURE YES SHALL I GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION OF THEM LET ME HEAR
WHO IS IN A MANNER THE CAPTAIN OF THEM IS IN A FRENZY AND WOULD FAIN DISCOVER WHOM HE CAN DEFRAUD OR DESPOIL OF HIS PROPERTY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GRATIFY THEM YES THAT IS SURE TO BE THE CASE HE MUST HAVE MONEY
THE OLD OPINIONS WHICH HE HAD WHEN A CHILD AND WHICH GAVE JUDGMENT ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL ARE OVERTHROWN BY THOSE OTHERS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN EMANCIPATED AND ARE NOW THE BODY GUARD OF LOVE AND SHARE HIS EMPIRE THESE IN HIS DEMOCRATIC DAYS
WELL AND GOOD BUT IF THEY RESIST HIM AS HE BEGAN BY BEATING HIS OWN FATHER AND MOTHER SO NOW IF HE HAS THE POWER HE BEATS THEM AND WILL KEEP HIS DEAR OLD FATHERLAND OR MOTHERLAND AS THE CRETANS SAY IN SUBJECTION TO HIS YOUNG RETAINERS
AND SEES ANYTHING OF INTEREST VERY TRUE HE SAID AND AMID EVILS SUCH AS THESE WILL NOT HE WHO IS ILL GOVERNED IN HIS OWN PERSON THE TYRANNICAL MAN I MEAN WHOM YOU JUST NOW DECIDED TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL
I MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE AWAKE WHEN THE REASONING AND HUMAN AND RULING POWER IS ASLEEP THEN THE WILD BEAST WITHIN US GORGED WITH MEAT OR DRINK STARTS UP AND HAVING SHAKEN OFF SLEEP
IS LEAST CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT SHE DESIRES THERE IS A GADFLY WHICH GOADS HER AND SHE IS FULL OF TROUBLE AND REMORSE CERTAINLY AND IS THE CITY WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT RICH OR POOR
BE LIKE THE TYRANNICAL STATE AND THE DEMOCRATICAL MAN LIKE THE DEMOCRATICAL STATE AND THE SAME OF THE OTHERS CERTAINLY AND AS STATE IS TO STATE IN VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS SO IS MAN IN RELATION TO MAN TO BE SURE
YES THE GREATEST BUT WILL YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF I WILL WORK OUT THE SUBJECT AND YOU SHALL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS PROCEED SAY THEN
WITH THE SOLID ADVANTAGES OF GOLD AND SILVER TRUE HE SAID AND THE LOVER OF HONOUR WHAT WILL BE HIS OPINION WILL HE NOT THINK THAT THE PLEASURE OF RICHES IS VULGAR WHILE THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING IF IT BRINGS NO DISTINCTION
LET ME THEN OFFER YOU AN ILLUSTRATION WHICH MAY I THINK THROW A LIGHT UPON THIS SUBJECT WHAT IS YOUR ILLUSTRATION THE CASE OF RICH INDIVIDUALS IN CITIES WHO POSSESS MANY SLAVES
HE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO ON A JOURNEY OR TO SEE THE THINGS WHICH OTHER FREEMEN DESIRE TO SEE BUT HE LIVES IN HIS HOLE LIKE A WOMAN HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE
THE CUNETTE THE HIDEOUS WALL OF GRENELLE ALL SPECKLED WITH BALLS MONT PARNASSE
ROAMS THE STREETS LODGES IN THE OPEN AIR WEARS AN OLD PAIR OF TROUSERS OF HIS FATHER'S WHICH DESCEND BELOW HIS HEELS AN OLD HAT OF SOME OTHER FATHER WHICH DESCENDS BELOW HIS EARS A SINGLE SUSPENDER OF YELLOW LISTING HE RUNS
CHAPTER TWO SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS THE GAMIN THE STREET ARAB OF PARIS IS THE DWARF OF THE GIANT LET US NOT EXAGGERATE
IS IT FOR A SEA EXCURSION NO FOR A VOYAGE A VOYAGE
AND ITS PROVISIONS STORED AWAY WAS READY FOR DEPARTURE
PHILEAS FOGG AND AOUDA WENT ON BOARD WHERE THEY FOUND FIX ALREADY INSTALLED BELOW DECK WAS A SQUARE CABIN OF WHICH THE WALLS BULGED OUT IN THE FORM OF COTS ABOVE A CIRCULAR DIVAN IN THE CENTRE WAS A TABLE PROVIDED WITH A SWINGING LAMP
THAT PLAYTHING OF THE WINDS AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TOWING IT IN CASE OF NECESSITY THERE IS NOT THE VESSEL WHICH GOES WHERE IT PLEASES EITHER BY MEANS OF OARS OR OF STEAM THE GALLEYS WERE THEN TO THE MARINE WHAT STEAMERS ARE TO DAY
MAKING THE NECESSARY PURCHASES FOR THE LONG VOYAGE BEFORE THEM IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR AN ENGLISHMAN LIKE MISTER FOGG TO MAKE THE TOUR OF THE WORLD WITH A CARPET BAG A LADY COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO TRAVEL COMFORTABLY UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS
SO LONG AS MAN IS IN HIS CHILDHOOD GOD WILLS THAT HE SHALL BE INNOCENT IF ONE WERE TO ASK THAT ENORMOUS CITY WHAT IS THIS SHE WOULD REPLY IT IS MY LITTLE ONE
FANATICISM TYRANNY BEWARE OF THE GAPING GAMIN THE LITTLE FELLOW WILL GROW UP OF WHAT CLAY IS HE MADE OF THE FIRST MUD THAT COMES TO HAND
PRESERVES THE SOUL WHAT WE HAVE JUST SAID TAKES AWAY NOTHING OF THE ANGUISH OF HEART WHICH ONE EXPERIENCES EVERY TIME THAT ONE MEETS ONE OF THESE CHILDREN AROUND WHOM ONE FANCIES THAT HE BEHOLDS FLOATING THE THREADS OF A BROKEN FAMILY
CALLING HACKNEY COACHES LETTING DOWN CARRIAGE STEPS ESTABLISHING MEANS OF TRANSIT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF A STREET IN HEAVY RAINS WHICH HE CALLS MAKING THE BRIDGE OF ARTS CRYING DISCOURSES PRONOUNCED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN FAVOR OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE
A MAN KEPT HIS HAT ON IN THE PRESENCE OF A PROCESSION IT WAS A HUGUENOT ATTITUDE HE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS A CHILD WAS ENCOUNTERED IN THE STREETS PROVIDED THAT HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TO SLEEP HE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS
WHICH HAD BEEN SENT BACK THERE THEY RETURNED TO THE WHARF
WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BEING GIVEN AND WE MUST NOW WAIT A WEEK FOR ANOTHER STEAMER AS HE SAID A WEEK FIX FELT HIS HEART LEAP FOR JOY
HE ACQUITTED HIS TASK WITH CHARACTERISTIC SERENITY AND INVARIABLY REPLIED TO THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS FAIR COMPANION WHO WAS CONFUSED BY HIS PATIENCE AND GENEROSITY IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF MY JOURNEY A PART OF MY PROGRAMME
THE POLICE CARRIED THEM OFF FOR WHAT MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE NO ONE KNEW PEOPLE WHISPERED WITH TERROR MONSTROUS CONJECTURES AS TO THE KING'S BATHS OF PURPLE BARBIER SPEAKS INGENUOUSLY OF THESE THINGS
THE BIRD IS CALLED THE SPARROW THE CHILD IS CALLED THE GAMIN COUPLE THESE TWO IDEAS WHICH CONTAIN THE ONE ALL THE FURNACE THE OTHER ALL THE DAWN STRIKE THESE TWO SPARKS TOGETHER PARIS CHILDHOOD
MISTER FOGG THEN LEARNED THAT THE CARNATIC HAD SAILED THE EVENING BEFORE HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NOT ONLY THE STEAMER BUT HIS DOMESTIC AND WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP BOTH BUT NO SIGN OF DISAPPOINTMENT APPEARED ON HIS FACE
BY THE WORD FORTUNE WE MEAN CHANCE TO SOME EXTENT THAT PIGMY KNEADED OUT OF COMMON EARTH IGNORANT UNLETTERED GIDDY VULGAR LOW
ON THE ELEVENTH AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING WE HAVE THEREFORE FOUR DAYS BEFORE US THAT IS NINETY SIX HOURS AND IN THAT TIME IF WE HAD GOOD LUCK AND A SOUTH WEST WIND AND THE SEA WAS CALM
IT IS NOT THAT HE IS PROSAIC FAR FROM THAT BUT HE REPLACES THE SOLEMN VISION BY THE FARCICAL PHANTASMAGORIA IF ADAMASTOR WERE TO APPEAR TO HIM THE STREET ARAB WOULD SAY HI THERE THE BUGABOO
HE HAS HIS OWN COINAGE WHICH IS COMPOSED OF ALL THE LITTLE MORSELS OF WORKED COPPER WHICH ARE FOUND ON THE PUBLIC STREETS THIS CURIOUS MONEY WHICH RECEIVES THE NAME OF LOQUES RAGS
PARIS ALONE HAS THIS IN ITS NATURAL HISTORY THE WHOLE OF THE MONARCHY IS CONTAINED IN THE LOUNGER
I SIR SEARCH ME CHAPTER THREE HE IS AGREEABLE IN THE EVENING THANKS TO A FEW SOUS WHICH HE ALWAYS FINDS MEANS TO PROCURE
WE SAY IT WITH THE PROPER AMOUNT OF REGRET WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE CLASSIC TASTE HE IS NOT VERY ACADEMIC BY NATURE THUS TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE POPULARITY OF MADEMOISELLE MARS
HE HAS NO SHIRT ON HIS BODY NO SHOES ON HIS FEET NO ROOF OVER HIS HEAD HE IS LIKE THE FLIES OF HEAVEN WHO HAVE NONE OF THESE THINGS HE IS FROM SEVEN TO THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE HE LIVES IN BANDS
CHILDREN GROUPED TUMULTUOUSLY FETID MUDDY DUSTY RAGGED DISHEVELLED PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK AND CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS ALL OF THEM ARE LITTLE ONES WHO HAVE MADE THEIR ESCAPE FROM POOR FAMILIES
IN GOING TO SHANGHAI WE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO SAIL WIDE OF THE CHINESE COAST WHICH WOULD BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE AS THE CURRENTS RUN NORTHWARD AND WOULD AID US PILOT SAID MISTER FOGG
ARE THEY THEIR SISTERS WHO ARE ALMOST YOUNG MAIDENS THIN FEVERISH WITH SUNBURNT HANDS COVERED WITH FRECKLES CROWNED WITH POPPIES AND EARS OF RYE GAY HAGGARD BAREFOOTED THEY CAN BE SEEN DEVOURING CHERRIES AMONG THE WHEAT
IF IT WOULD NOT PUT YOUR HONOUR OUT HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS ON ACCOUNT SIR ADDED PHILEAS FOGG TURNING TO FIX
THE CARNATIC WOULD LEAVE THE HARBOUR MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA GOT INTO THE PALANQUIN THEIR LUGGAGE BEING BROUGHT AFTER ON A WHEELBARROW
FINDS WITHOUT SEEKING KNOWS WHAT HE IS IGNORANT OF IS A SPARTAN TO THE POINT OF THIEVING IS MAD TO WISDOM IS LYRICAL TO FILTH WOULD CROUCH DOWN ON OLYMPUS WALLOWS IN THE DUNGHILL AND EMERGES FROM IT COVERED WITH STARS
THIS CHERUB OF THE GUTTER SOMETIMES HAS A SHIRT BUT IN THAT CASE HE OWNS BUT ONE HE SOMETIMES HAS SHOES BUT THEN THEY HAVE NO SOLES HE SOMETIMES HAS A LODGING AND HE LOVES IT FOR HE FINDS HIS MOTHER THERE
OCCUPY THE THOUGHTFUL MAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THESE VISIONS MINGLE WITH HIS DREAMS PARIS CENTRE BANLIEUE CIRCUMFERENCE
CHAPTER FOUR HE MAY BE OF USE
BUT ADDED THE PILOT IT MIGHT BE ARRANGED ANOTHER WAY FIX CEASED TO BREATHE AT ALL HOW ASKED MISTER FOGG
AND ALLOWING THEIR OWN ENTRAILS TO FALL ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY HENCE THESE OBSCURE DESTINIES THIS IS CALLED
BUT WHICH HAS A LOOK AND IS SO TERRIBLE THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEHELD IT HE CALLS THIS MONSTER THE DEAF THING THE SEARCH FOR THESE DEAF THINGS AMONG THE STONES IS A JOY OF FORMIDABLE NATURE
MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA WHO WERE SEATED ON DECK
LIES IN WAIT RUMMAGES ABOUT WASTES TIME BLACKENS PIPES SWEARS LIKE A CONVICT
ANOTHER PLEASURE CONSISTS IN SUDDENLY PRYING UP A PAVING STONE AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE WOOD LICE EACH REGION OF PARIS IS CELEBRATED FOR THE INTERESTING TREASURES WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND THERE
CHANCE HOWEVER APPEARED REALLY TO HAVE ABANDONED THE MAN IT HAD HITHERTO SERVED SO WELL FOR THREE HOURS PHILEAS FOGG WANDERED ABOUT THE DOCKS WITH THE DETERMINATION IF NECESSARY TO CHARTER A VESSEL TO CARRY HIM TO YOKOHAMA
THE KING RIGHTLY DESIRED TO CREATE A FLEET THE IDEA WAS A GOOD ONE BUT LET US CONSIDER THE MEANS THERE CAN BE NO FLEET IF
THE GAMIN LOVES THE CITY HE ALSO LOVES SOLITUDE SINCE HE HAS SOMETHING OF THE SAGE IN HIM
BUT THE FRENCHMAN DID NOT APPEAR AND WITHOUT DOUBT WAS STILL LYING UNDER THE STUPEFYING INFLUENCE OF THE OPIUM
THE MYSTERIOUS CHARM OF GREAT SOMBRE WALLS SQUARELY INTERSECTING IMMENSE VAGUE STRETCHES OF LAND INUNDATED WITH SUNSHINE AND FULL OF BUTTERFLIES ALL THIS ATTRACTED HIM
A SORT OF LISPING OF BATTLE THOSE HERMITS BY DAY AND CUT THROATS BY NIGHT THAT CLUMSY MILL WHICH TURNS IN THE WIND
THERE IS A DOCTOR HEY THERE SHOUTS SOME STREET ARAB HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN CUSTOMARY FOR DOCTORS TO CARRY HOME THEIR OWN WORK ANOTHER IS IN A CROWD A GRAVE MAN ADORNED WITH SPECTACLES AND TRINKETS TURNS ROUND INDIGNANTLY
AND OFFERING HIS ARM TO AOUDA HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE DOCKS IN SEARCH OF SOME CRAFT ABOUT TO START FIX STUPEFIED FOLLOWED IT SEEMED AS IF HE WERE ATTACHED TO MISTER FOGG BY AN INVISIBLE THREAD
HENCE IN THESE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACES INDELIBLY STAMPED BY THE PASSING STROLLER WITH THE EPITHET MELANCHOLY THE APPARENTLY OBJECTLESS PROMENADES OF THE DREAMER
STRAY CHILDREN ABOUNDED IN PARIS THE STATISTICS GIVE AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOMELESS CHILDREN PICKED UP ANNUALLY AT THAT PERIOD BY THE POLICE PATROLS IN UNENCLOSED LANDS
HE WHO WRITES THESE LINES HAS LONG BEEN A PROWLER ABOUT THE BARRIERS OF PARIS AND IT IS FOR HIM A SOURCE OF PROFOUND SOUVENIRS THAT CLOSE SHAVEN TURF THOSE PEBBLY PATHS THAT CHALK THOSE POOLS
BUT HE COULD ONLY FIND VESSELS WHICH WERE LOADING OR UNLOADING AND WHICH COULD NOT THEREFORE SET SAIL FIX BEGAN TO HOPE AGAIN BUT MISTER FOGG FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED
IT IS A BARGAIN ARE YOU THE MASTER OF THE BOAT YES JOHN BUNSBY MASTER OF THE TANKADERE WOULD YOU LIKE SOME EARNEST MONEY
BUT ODD AND COMPOSED OF TWO NATURES WHICH SURROUNDS CERTAIN GREAT CITIES NOTABLY PARIS TO STUDY THE SUBURBS IS TO STUDY THE AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL END OF THE TREES BEGINNING OF THE ROOFS END OF THE GRASS
THE STREET BOY OF PARIS WE INSIST ON THIS POINT HOWEVER DEFACED AND INJURED ON THE SURFACE IS ALMOST INTACT ON THE INTERIOR IT IS A MAGNIFICENT THING TO PUT ON RECORD
IN AN HOUR
AND COMPASSED THE AIMS OF THE POWERFUL THE HATRED OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE WAS A DOGMA WHAT IS THE USE OF HALF LIGHTS SUCH WAS THE COUNTERSIGN NOW THE ERRING CHILD IS THE COROLLARY OF THE IGNORANT CHILD
BUT HE PREFERS THE STREET BECAUSE THERE HE FINDS LIBERTY HE HAS HIS OWN GAMES
GRAND REIGN GRAND CENTURY
OR RATHER THERE THEY EXIST FAR FROM EVERY EYE IN THE SWEET LIGHT OF MAY OR JUNE KNEELING ROUND A HOLE IN THE GROUND SNAPPING MARBLES WITH THEIR THUMBS QUARRELLING OVER HALF FARTHINGS IRRESPONSIBLE VOLATILE FREE AND HAPPY
IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE PRESENT DAY INCOMPLETE AS IT STILL IS IT IS NOT A VERY ABNORMAL THING TO BEHOLD THESE FRACTURED FAMILIES POURING THEMSELVES OUT INTO THE DARKNESS NOT KNOWING CLEARLY WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEIR CHILDREN
HE UPSETS THE COMPOSURE OF THE SHOPKEEPER WITH HIS WILD LAUGHTER HE RANGES BOLDLY FROM HIGH COMEDY TO FARCE A FUNERAL PASSES BY
THE HOMUNCIO ENTERS A THEATRE ON CROSSING THAT MAGIC THRESHOLD HE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED HE WAS THE STREET ARAB
THANKS SIR I WAS ABOUT TO ASK THE FAVOUR VERY WELL IN HALF AN HOUR WE SHALL GO ON BOARD
EXCEPT TO RAISE MUSHROOMS AND WHICH IS CLOSED ON A LEVEL WITH THE GROUND BY A TRAP DOOR OF ROTTEN PLANKS THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME IS ONE IDEA THE BANLIEUE OF PARIS IS ANOTHER TO BEHOLD NOTHING BUT FIELDS
TO ROAM THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT THAT IS TO SAY TO LOUNGE IS A FINE EMPLOYMENT OF TIME IN THE EYES OF THE PHILOSOPHER PARTICULARLY IN THAT RATHER ILLEGITIMATE SPECIES OF CAMPAIGN WHICH IS TOLERABLY UGLY
WERE YOU NOT LIKE ME SIR A PASSENGER BY THE RANGOON WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY I WAS SIR REPLIED MISTER FOGG COLDLY BUT I HAVE NOT THE HONOUR PARDON ME I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOUR SERVANT HERE
THE SAILOR LEANED ON THE RAILING OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND SAID IS YOUR HONOUR JOKING
AND NO SOONER DO THEY CATCH SIGHT OF YOU THAN THEY RECOLLECT THAT THEY HAVE AN INDUSTRY AND THAT THEY MUST EARN THEIR LIVING AND THEY OFFER TO SELL YOU AN OLD WOOLLEN STOCKING FILLED WITH COCKCHAFERS OR A BUNCH OF LILACS
WAS CONTINUING HIS SEARCH RESOLVED NOT TO STOP IF HE HAD TO RESORT TO MACAO WHEN HE WAS ACCOSTED BY A SAILOR ON ONE OF THE WHARVES IS YOUR HONOUR LOOKING FOR A BOAT HAVE YOU A BOAT READY TO SAIL
BESIDES THIS THE MONARCHY SOMETIMES WAS IN NEED OF CHILDREN AND IN THAT CASE IT SKIMMED THE STREETS
THERE WOULD BE TIME FOR THE WARRANT TO ARRIVE AND FORTUNE AT LAST FAVOURED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LAW HIS HORROR MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN HE HEARD MISTER FOGG SAY IN HIS PLACID VOICE
WE COULD NOT REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME FOR IT IS SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES FROM HONG KONG ONLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED SAID MISTER FOGG IT'S THE SAME THING
SO DID I MADAM AND I AM EXCESSIVELY DISAPPOINTED THE CARNATIC ITS REPAIRS BEING COMPLETED LEFT HONG KONG TWELVE HOURS BEFORE THE STATED TIME
IT IS IN THAT KEEL THAT THE TITI HUDDLE TOGETHER THE TITI IS TO THE GAMIN WHAT THE MOTH IS TO THE LARVA THE SAME BEING ENDOWED WITH WINGS AND SOARING IT SUFFICES FOR HIM TO BE THERE WITH HIS RADIANCE OF HAPPINESS
THERE IS HARDLY ANY ONE ON EARTH WHO IS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE SINGULAR SPOTS
WE COULD MAKE THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES TO SHANGHAI
WHICH INHABITS THE NOOKS OF OLD LIME KILNS AND WELLS THAT HAVE RUN DRY WHICH IS BLACK HAIRY STICKY WHICH CRAWLS SOMETIMES SLOWLY SOMETIMES RAPIDLY WHICH HAS NO CRY
PIERCING MELANCHOLY NATURE AND HUMANITY BOTH APPEAL TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME THERE LOCAL ORIGINALITIES THERE MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE ANY ONE WHO LIKE OURSELVES
AS FAR AS SAYINGS ARE CONCERNED THIS CHILD HAS AS MANY OF THEM AS TALLEYRAND HE IS NO LESS CYNICAL BUT HE IS MORE HONEST HE IS ENDOWED WITH A CERTAIN INDESCRIBABLE UNEXPECTED JOVIALITY
SHE HAD ALREADY PROVED BY GAINING SEVERAL PRIZES IN PILOT BOAT RACES THE CREW OF THE TANKADERE WAS COMPOSED OF JOHN BUNSBY THE MASTER AND FOUR HARDY MARINERS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE CHINESE SEAS JOHN BUNSBY HIMSELF
HAS RAGS LIKE A BABY AND TATTERS LIKE A PHILOSOPHER FISHES IN THE SEWER HUNTS IN THE CESSPOOL EXTRACTS MIRTH FROM FOULNESS WHIPS UP THE SQUARES WITH HIS WIT GRINS AND BITES WHISTLES AND SINGS SHOUTS AND SHRIEKS
I MUST TAKE THE AMERICAN STEAMER AT YOKOHAMA AND NOT AT SHANGHAI OR NAGASAKI WHY NOT
CURRIT ROTA THE SPIRIT OF PARIS THAT DEMON WHICH CREATES THE CHILDREN OF CHANCE AND THE MEN OF DESTINY
EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING BETWEEN THE ANXIETY TO GAIN A LARGE SUM AND THE FEAR OF VENTURING SO FAR FIX WAS IN MORTAL SUSPENSE
HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF BEING ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING
THE SAN FRANCISCO STEAMER DOES NOT START FROM YOKOHAMA IT PUTS IN AT YOKOHAMA AND NAGASAKI BUT IT STARTS FROM SHANGHAI YOU ARE SURE OF THAT PERFECTLY AND WHEN DOES THE BOAT LEAVE SHANGHAI
THE DEVIL A BLACK INSECT WHICH MENACES BY TWISTING ABOUT ITS TAIL ARMED WITH TWO HORNS HE HAS HIS FABULOUS MONSTER WHICH HAS SCALES UNDER ITS BELLY BUT IS NOT A LIZARD WHICH HAS PUSTULES ON ITS BACK BUT IS NOT A TOAD
A HANDFUL OF DIRT A BREATH AND BEHOLD ADAM IT SUFFICES FOR A GOD TO PASS BY A GOD HAS ALWAYS PASSED OVER THE STREET ARAB FORTUNE LABORS AT THIS TINY BEING
AS GRACEFULLY BUILT AS IF SHE WERE A RACING YACHT HER SHINING COPPER SHEATHING HER GALVANISED IRON WORK HER DECK WHITE AS IVORY BETRAYED THE PRIDE TAKEN BY JOHN BUNSBY IN MAKING HER PRESENTABLE
AND HE MERELY REMARKED TO AOUDA IT IS AN ACCIDENT MADAM NOTHING MORE AT THIS MOMENT A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OBSERVING HIM ATTENTIVELY APPROACHED IT WAS FIX WHO BOWING ADDRESSED MISTER FOGG
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THE EXEMPTS OF THE GUARD WHEN THEY RAN SHORT OF CHILDREN TOOK THOSE WHO HAD FATHERS THE FATHERS IN DESPAIR ATTACKED THE EXEMPTS IN THAT CASE THE PARLIAMENT INTERVENED AND HAD SOME ONE HUNG
THOSE HARSH MONOTONIES OF WASTE AND FALLOW LANDS THE PLANTS OF EARLY MARKET GARDEN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO SIGHT IN A BOTTOM THAT MIXTURE OF THE SAVAGE AND THE CITIZEN THOSE VAST DESERT NOOKS WHERE THE GARRISON DRUMS PRACTISE NOISILY
HOUSES OR TREES IN WHAT A STRETCH OF COUNTRY OFFERS US IS TO REMAIN ON THE SURFACE ALL ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THOUGHTS OF GOD
THE OUTER BOULEVARD IS THEIR BREATHING SPACE THE SUBURBS BELONG TO THEM THERE THEY ARE ETERNALLY PLAYING TRUANT THERE THEY INNOCENTLY SING THEIR REPERTORY OF DIRTY SONGS THERE THEY ARE
HAS WANDERED ABOUT IN THESE SOLITUDES CONTIGUOUS TO OUR FAUBOURGS WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED AS THE LIMBOS OF PARIS HAS SEEN HERE AND THERE IN THE MOST DESERT SPOT AT THE MOST UNEXPECTED MOMENT
THE GAMIN OF PARIS IS RABELAIS IN THIS YOUTH HE IS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS TROUSERS UNLESS THEY HAVE A WATCH POCKET HE IS NOT EASILY ASTONISHED
AND ONE WHICH SHINES FORTH IN THE SPLENDID PROBITY OF OUR POPULAR REVOLUTIONS THAT A CERTAIN INCORRUPTIBILITY RESULTS FROM THE IDEA WHICH EXISTS IN THE AIR OF PARIS AS SALT EXISTS IN THE WATER OF THE OCEAN TO BREATHE PARIS
ARE YOU IN EARNEST VERY MUCH SO THE PILOT WALKED AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND GAZED OUT TO SEA
A MAN OF FORTY FIVE OR THEREABOUTS VIGOROUS SUNBURNT WITH A SPRIGHTLY EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND ENERGETIC AND SELF RELIANT COUNTENANCE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED CONFIDENCE IN THE MOST TIMID
YES YOUR HONOUR A PILOT BOAT NO FORTY THREE THE BEST IN THE HARBOUR DOES SHE GO FAST BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE KNOTS THE HOUR WILL YOU LOOK AT HER YES YOUR HONOUR WILL BE SATISFIED WITH HER
I SHALL DO ALL I CAN TO FIND HIM REPLIED PHILEAS FOGG WHILE FIX IN A FEVERISH NERVOUS STATE REPAIRED TO THE PILOT BOAT THE OTHERS DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TO THE POLICE STATION AT HONG KONG
CALLS GAY WOMEN THOU TALKS SLANG SINGS OBSCENE SONGS AND HAS NO EVIL IN HIS HEART THIS IS BECAUSE HE HAS IN HIS HEART A PEARL INNOCENCE AND PEARLS ARE NOT TO BE DISSOLVED IN MUD
I COULD NOT RISK MYSELF MY MEN OR MY LITTLE BOAT OF SCARCELY TWENTY TONS ON SO LONG A VOYAGE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR BESIDES
HIS PECULIAR METAPHORS TO BE DEAD IS TO EAT DANDELIONS BY THE ROOT
IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG WHILE THESE EVENTS WERE PASSING AT THE OPIUM HOUSE MISTER FOGG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF LOSING THE STEAMER WAS QUIETLY ESCORTING AOUDA ABOUT THE STREETS OF THE ENGLISH QUARTER
LEST CHANCE SHOULD DIRECT THE STEPS OF THE UNFORTUNATE SERVANT WHOM HE HAD SO BADLY TREATED IN THIS DIRECTION IN WHICH CASE AN EXPLANATION THE REVERSE OF SATISFACTORY TO THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE ENSUED
BEGINNING OF THE PAVEMENTS END OF THE FURROWS BEGINNING OF THE SHOPS END OF THE WHEEL RUTS BEGINNING OF THE PASSIONS END OF THE DIVINE MURMUR BEGINNING OF THE HUMAN UPROAR HENCE AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST
MISTER FOGG NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST VEXATION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TAKING HIS CARPET BAG CALLING AOUDA AND SENDING FOR A PALANQUIN IT WAS THEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AT HALF PAST NINE IT BEING THEN HIGH TIDE
THIS PALE CHILD OF THE PARISIAN FAUBOURGS LIVES AND DEVELOPS MAKES CONNECTIONS GROWS SUPPLE IN SUFFERING IN THE PRESENCE OF SOCIAL REALITIES AND OF HUMAN THINGS A THOUGHTFUL WITNESS HE THINKS HIMSELF HEEDLESS AND HE IS NOT
BUT KNOWING THAT THE STEAMER WAS NOT TO LEAVE FOR YOKOHAMA UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING HE DID NOT DISTURB HIMSELF ABOUT THE MATTER
HAS AN INVARIABLE AND WELL REGULATED CURRENCY IN THIS LITTLE BOHEMIA OF CHILDREN LASTLY HE HAS HIS OWN FAUNA WHICH HE OBSERVES ATTENTIVELY IN THE CORNERS THE LADY BIRD THE DEATH'S HEAD PLANT LOUSE THE DADDY LONG LEGS
LET US MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF PARIS NEVERTHELESS IN A RELATIVE MEASURE AND IN SPITE OF THE SOUVENIR WHICH WE HAVE JUST RECALLED THE EXCEPTION IS JUST
IN HOUSES IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGES ONE OF THESE NESTS WHICH HAS BECOME FAMOUS PRODUCED THE SWALLOWS OF THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA THIS IS MOREOVER THE MOST DISASTROUS OF SOCIAL SYMPTOMS ALL CRIMES OF THE MAN BEGIN
AMONG THAT LITTLE AUDIENCE OF STORMY CHILDREN WAS SEASONED WITH A TOUCH OF IRONY THE GAMIN CALLED HER MADEMOISELLE MUCHE HIDE YOURSELF THIS BEING BAWLS AND SCOFFS AND RIDICULES AND FIGHTS
IN THE EVENING THEY CAN BE HEARD LAUGHING THESE GROUPS
HER TWO MASTS LEANED A TRIFLE BACKWARD SHE CARRIED BRIGANTINE FORESAIL STORM JIB AND STANDING JIB AND WAS WELL RIGGED FOR RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND AND SHE SEEMED CAPABLE OF BRISK SPEED WHICH INDEED
COULD HE HAVE GONE ON BOARD THE CARNATIC WITHOUT US WITHOUT YOU MADAM ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE EXCUSE ME DID YOU INTEND TO SAIL IN THE CARNATIC YES SIR
TO BE CAST ON THE PAVEMENTS OF PARIS LET IT BE SAID BY THE WAY THAT THIS ABANDONMENT OF CHILDREN WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BY THE ANCIENT MONARCHY A LITTLE OF EGYPT AND BOHEMIA IN THE LOWER REGIONS SUITED THE UPPER SPHERES
THEREFORE GALLEYS WERE NECESSARY BUT THE GALLEY IS MOVED ONLY BY THE GALLEY SLAVE HENCE GALLEY SLAVES WERE REQUIRED
THE SAME FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN GONE THROUGH AT THE FRENCH CONSULATE
HIDEOUS ABOMINABLE KEEL THE NAME OF PARADISE BESTOW ON AN INDIVIDUAL THE USELESS AND DEPRIVE HIM OF THE NECESSARY AND YOU HAVE THE GAMIN THE GAMIN IS NOT DEVOID OF LITERARY INTUITION
HE MAKES SONGS ON SUPERSTITIONS HE TAKES THE WIND OUT OF EXAGGERATIONS HE TWITS MYSTERIES HE THRUSTS OUT HIS TONGUE AT GHOSTS HE TAKES THE POETRY OUT OF STILTED THINGS HE INTRODUCES CARICATURE INTO EPIC EXTRAVAGANZAS
HE LOOKS AND IS ON THE VERGE OF LAUGHTER HE IS ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING ELSE ALSO WHOEVER YOU MAY BE IF YOUR NAME IS PREJUDICE ABUSE IGNORANCE OPPRESSION INIQUITY DESPOTISM INJUSTICE
I AM SORRY SAID THE SAILOR BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I OFFER YOU A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY AND AN ADDITIONAL REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF I REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME
ON NOVEMBER NINTH OF THE PRECEDING YEAR THE KING OF ENGLAND GAVE ONE OF HIS BIRTHDAY HONORS TO THE SAME MAN MAKING HIM A COMPANION OF SAINT MICHAEL AND SAINT GEORGE C M G WILFRED THOMASON GRENFELL
ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS INHERITANCE HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED THE COURAGE PATIENCE PERSISTENCE AND FIGHTING AND TEACHING QUALITIES WHICH ARE EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS OWN ABILITIES TO COMMAND TO ADMINISTER AND TO UPLIFT ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE WERE THE GRENVILLES
THEN I SUPPOSE THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE SAID LORD CHILTERN MY DEAR LORD CHILTERN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE VESTED INTERESTS HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO KEEPERS SHALL PREFER FOXES TO PHEASANTS WIRES SHALL BE UNHEARD OF
WHO BOARDED THE SPANISH ADMIRAL'S SHIP THE ESMERALDA ON THE PORT SIDE WHILE COCHRANE CAME UP ON THE STARBOARD WHEN TOGETHER THEY MADE SHORT WORK OF THE CAPTURE NOR HAS THE STRAIN DIED OUT AS IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PRESENT GENERATION BY MANY OF DOCTOR GRENFELL'S COUSINS
TO WHOM CAN I APPLY TO APPOINT OTHERS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT VESTED INTERESTS MEAN LORD CHILTERN THEN NOBODY CAN MANAGE HIS OWN PROPERTY AS HE PLEASES NOBODY CAN UNLESS HE DOES THE WORK HIMSELF IF I WERE TO GO AND LIVE IN TRUMPETON WOOD I COULD DO IT BUT YOU SEE I HAVE TO LIVE HERE
I WANT YOU TO GET ME A ROOM AT A VERY QUIET HOTEL THIS DONE YOU ARE TO HUNT UP THE MAN WHOSE NAME YOU WILL FIND WRITTEN IN THIS PAPER
ASK DICK OVER THERE HE KNOWS HIM THE DETECTIVE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO ESCAPE AND ASK DICK BUT HE WAS BETTER PLEASED YET WHEN DICK A FELLOW WITH A SQUINT WHOSE HAND WAS ALWAYS IN THE SUGAR TOLD HIM THAT MISTER WELLGOOD WOULD PROBABLY BE IN FOR HIS MAIL IN A FEW MOMENTS
THE DUKE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE LORD CHILTERN HAD BEEN VIOLENT AND LORD CHILTERN HAD BEEN VIOLENT BECAUSE MISTER FOTHERGILL'S CONDUCT HAD BEEN TO HIS THINKING NOT ONLY SACRILEGIOUS BUT ONE CONTINUED COURSE OF WILFUL SACRILEGE
HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE GREAT LADS BRIGADES WHICH HAVE DONE MUCH GOOD AND FOSTERED MORE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE SET FOR ALLIED ACTIVITIES NOR WERE THE NEEDS OF HIS OWN BODILY MACHINE NEGLECTED FOOTBALL ROWING AND THE TENNIS COURT KEPT HIM IN CONDITION
TO SUCH A PLACE CAME DOCTOR GRENFELL IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO TO CAST IN HIS LOT WITH ITS INHABITANTS TO LIVE THERE SO LONG AS HE SHOULD TO DIE THERE WERE IT GOD'S WILL
IN WHICH THE NEW DUKE OF OMNIUM WAS ACCUSED OF NEGLECTING HIS DUTY TO THE COUNTY IN WHICH A PORTION OF HIS PROPERTY LAY THE QUESTION WAS ARGUED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH IS A LANDED PROPRIETOR BOUND OR IS HE NOT TO KEEP FOXES FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF HIS NEIGHBOURS
HERE HE GLANCED AT EVERY DOOR AND WINDOW AND THEN LEANING FORWARD OVER THE TABLE AT WHICH THE TWO OFFICIALS SAT HE BROUGHT HIS HEAD AS NEARLY TO THEM AS POSSIBLE AND WHISPERED FIVE WORDS THEY PRODUCED A MOST UNHAPPY SENSATION BOTH THE MEN
BUT CARES FOR THE SICK AND INJURED IN ITS FOUR HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARY PROVIDES HOUSE VISITATION BY MEANS OF DOG SLEDGE JOURNEYS COVERING HUNDREDS OF MILES IN A YEAR TEACHES WHOLESOME AND RIGHTEOUS LIVING
BOTH IN BOOKS AND IN PLAY FOR THE ONE GAINED A SCHOLARSHIP AND THE OTHER AN ENDURING INTEREST IN RUGBY FOOTBALL MATRICULATING LATER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON GRENFELL ENTERED THE LONDON HOSPITAL AND THERE LAID NOT ONLY THE FOUNDATION OF HIS MEDICAL EDUCATION
THIS IS THE MAN WHO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WENT TO THE COAST OF LABRADOR TO SUCCOR WITH MEDICAL AID THE SOLITARY FISHERMEN OF THE NORTHERN SEA IN EXECUTING WHICH SERVICE HE DESPISED THE PERILS OF THE OCEAN WHICH ARE THERE MOST TERRIBLE
HARDENED AS THEY WERE BY DUTIES WHICH SOON SAP THE SENSIBILITIES STARTED AND TURNED AS PALE AS THE SPEAKER HIMSELF THEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH ONE GLANCE AT THE INSPECTOR ROSE AND LOCKED THE DOOR
OR PAY ATTENTION TO THE SHOOTING AND AS THE DUKE WOULD NOT LET THE SHOOTING OF HIS WOOD MISTER FOTHERGILL THE STEWARD HAD GRADUALLY BECOME OMNIPOTENT NOW MISTER FOTHERGILL WAS NOT A HUNTING MAN BUT THE MISCHIEF DID NOT AT ALL LIE THERE LORD CHILTERN WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH MISTER FOTHERGILL
DEVOTED TO WORK AND TO PARLIAMENT AN UNSELFISH FRIENDLY WISE MAN WHO BY NO MEANS WANTED OTHER MEN TO CUT THEIR COATS ACCORDING TO HIS PATTERN WAS THE LAST MAN IN ENGLAND TO PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS THE ENEMY OF AN ESTABLISHED DELIGHT HE DID NOT HUNT HIMSELF
OF COURSE YOU'LL COME YOU OWE IT TO US TO COME AND MAY I SAY THIS IF THERE BE ANYBODY TO COME WITH YOU THAT WILL MAKE IT ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER IF IT SHOULD BE SO OF COURSE THERE WILL BE LETTERS WRITTEN
ANY MORE THAN A BEAR TO BE BAITED OR A BADGER TO BE DRAWN IN LET US SAY HIS LONDON DINING ROOM BUT A GOOD DEAL HAD BEEN SAID WHICH THOUGH NOT PERHAPS CAPABLE OF CONVINCING THE UNPREJUDICED AMERICAN OR FRENCHMAN HAD BEEN REGARDED AS COGENT ARGUMENTS TO COUNTRY BRED ENGLISHMEN
AS FOR THE DUKE HE CAN'T BE COMFORTABLE IN HIS ARITHMETIC FOR THINKING OF THEM BUT WHAT CAN ONE DO
IN THESE FINE EARLY AUTUMN DAYS SPENT AT MATCHING THE GREAT TRUMPETON WOOD QUESTION WAS AT LAST SETTLED DURING THE SUMMER CONSIDERABLE ACERBITY HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE MATTER BY CERTAIN ARTICLES WHICH HAD APPEARED IN CERTAIN SPORTING PAPERS
HEARD THE WORDS THAT'S HE AS SHOT THE FOX THE GENTLEMAN DID NOT APPEAR AT DINNER NOR WAS HE EVER AGAIN SEEN IN THOSE PARTS MISTER FOTHERGILL HAD BECOME ANGRY LORD CHILTERN AS WE KNOW HAD BEEN VERY ANGRY AND EVEN THE DUKE WAS ANGRY
NOTHING SHORT OF AN EMBASSY ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT COVERTS OF HIS COUNTRY WOULD HAVE KEPT THIS MASTER AWAY AT PRESENT AND NOW HIS DIPLOMACY HAVING SUCCEEDED HE HURRIED BACK TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS RESULTS LADY CHILTERN BEFORE SHE WENT MADE A LITTLE SPEECH TO PHINEAS FINN
RIGHTLY THEN WE PRAISE HIM BY WHOSE PRAISE NOT HE ALONE BUT OUR UNIVERSITY ALSO IS HONORED I PRESENT TO YOU WILFRED THOMASON GRENFELL THAT HE MAY BE ADMITTED TO THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR IN MEDICINE
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE AFFLICTED WITH A WILD DISMAY ALL WHICH LORD CHILTERN UNDERSTOOD WELL WHEN HE BECAME SO LOUD IN HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DUKE BUT OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND ONLY THE OTHER DAY A DUKE PLANTY PALL AS HE WAS LATELY CALLED
THE DETECTIVE WITH SOME SEMBLANCE OF RESPECT ANSWERED THAT HE HAD SEEN WELLGOOD BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DETAIN HIM OR BRING HIM WITHIN HIS EMPLOYER'S OBSERVATION HE IS A PATENT MEDICINE MAN HE THEN EXPLAINED
TILL SWEETWATER BROUGHT THE GARRULOUS DICK TO A STANDSTILL BY ASKING WHETHER WELLGOOD HAD BEEN AWAY FOR ANY PURPOSE SINCE HE FIRST CAME TO TOWN HE RECEIVED THE REPLY THAT HE HAD JUST COME HOME FROM NEW YORK WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR SOME ARTICLES NEEDED IN HIS MANUFACTORY SWEETWATER FELT ALL HIS CONVICTIONS CONFIRMED
THAT THOUGH THE MATTER HAD BEEN INTRODUCED SOMEWHAT JOCOSELY THERE COULD NOT REALLY BE ANY JOKE ABOUT IT WHY COULDN'T YOU KEEP IT ALL OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS I DON'T WRITE THE NEWSPAPERS DUCHESS I CAN'T HELP THE NEWSPAPERS WHEN TWO HUNDRED MEN RIDE THROUGH TRUMPETON WOOD AND SEE ONE FOX FOUND
HOW THEN GO TO WORK TO SECURE HIS COOPERATION IN A SCHEME POSSIBLY AS MYSTERIOUS TO HIM AS IT WAS TO HIMSELF HE COULD STOP THIS STRANGER IN MID STREET WITH SOME PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE BUT IT DID NOT FOLLOW THAT HE WOULD SUCCEED IN LURING HIM TO THE HOTEL WHERE MISTER GREY COULD SEE HIM
HIS CALCULATION WAS A CORRECT ONE THE STORE WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE TAKING HIS PLACE IN THE LINE DRAWN UP BEFORE THE POST OFFICE WINDOW HE AWAITED HIS TURN
WELLGOOD OR AS HE BELIEVED SEARS KNEW TOO MUCH OF LIFE TO BE BEGUILED BY ANY OPEN CLAP TRAP AND SWEETWATER WAS OBLIGED TO SEE HIM DRIVE OFF WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE LEAST ADVANCE IN THE PURPOSE ENGROSSING HIM BUT THAT WAS NOTHING HE HAD ALL THE EVENING BEFORE HIM
I'D GO AND NURSE THE FOXES MYSELF IF I KNEW HOW WOULDN'T I MARIE THEY HAVE ROBBED THE DUCHESS OF HER SLEEP FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MADAME GOESLER AND IF THEY GO ON BEING NOT PROPERLY BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED THEY'LL MAKE AN OLD WOMAN OF ME
I SEE THAT HIS LETTERS PASS THROUGH THIS OFFICE YOU'RE TAKING UP ANOTHER MAN'S TIME COMPLAINED THE POSTMASTER
LADY CHILTERN AND MADAME GOESLER WERE PRESENT AND ALSO PHINEAS FINN WELL HOW ABOUT THEM SAID THE LORD
MANY THINGS ARE NO DOUBT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAW WHICH IF DONE WOULD SHOW THE DOER OF THEM TO BE THE ENEMY OF HIS SPECIES AND THIS DESTRUCTION OF FOXES IN A HUNTING COUNTRY MAY BE NAMED AS ONE OF THEM THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE HIS FOXES DESTROYED IF HE PLEASED
THE BROAD STRETCH OF SEAWARD TRENDING SAND WITH ITS INTERLACING RIVULETS OF FRESH AND BRACKISH WATER MADE A TEMPTING THOUGH TREACHEROUS PLAYGROUND ALLURING ALIKE IN THE VARIED FORMS OF LIFE IT HARBORED AND IN THE ADVENTURE WHICH WHETTED EXPLORATION
IT APPEARED TO SERVE HIM NOW FOR WHEN THE MAN FINALLY SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE CROSS WALK SEPARATING THE TWO BUILDINGS HE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN INDECISION NOT UNLIKE THAT OF DREAD AND THERE BEING NOTHING IN THE MAN'S APPEARANCE TO WARRANT APPREHENSION
MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL STILL STANDS ENLARGED AND MODERNIZED IN THE CHARGE OF DOCTOR GRENFELL'S ELDER BROTHER AND IN IT HIS MOTHER IS STILL THE REAL HEAD AND CONTROLLING GENIUS PARKGATE
THEY COULD PASS AND REPASS WITHOUT AROUSING HIS ATTENTION BUT THE MOMENT A MAN STEPPED HIS WAY HE SHRANK FROM HIM ONLY TO BETRAY THE GREATEST CURIOSITY CONCERNING HIM THE MOMENT HE FELT IT SAFE TO TURN AND OBSERVE HIM
THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE GRIPSACK HE HAD SET DOWN IN A CORNER ON ENTERING ALSO FROM A CERTAIN TOUSLED APPEARANCE WHICH BESPOKE HASTY RISING AND BUT FEW FACILITIES FOR PROPER ATTENTION TO HIS PERSON THESE DETAILS COUNTED LITTLE HOWEVER IN THE ASTONISHMENT CREATED BY HIS MANNER
LORD CHILTERN WOULD WRITE TO THE DUKE AND MISTER FOTHERGILL BECAME AN ESTABLISHED ENEMY
AH MISTER GREY ROSE PRECIPITATELY HIS MANNER HAD CHANGED I MUST SEE HIM WHAT YOU TELL ME MAKES IT ALL THE MORE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE HIM HOW CAN YOU BRING IT ABOUT WITHOUT HIS SEEING YOU SWEETWATER ASKED YES YES CERTAINLY WITHOUT HIS SEEING ME
AND ENDED THE COLLOQUY WITH THE FINAL QUESTION AND WHERE IS HIS MANUFACTORY MIGHT BE WORTH VISITING PERHAPS THE OTHER MADE A GESTURE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NORTHWEST AND RUSHED TO HELP A CUSTOMER SWEETWATER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SLIDE AWAY
FOR HE WENT WHISTLING INTO THE STORE FROM WHICH HE PRESENTLY REISSUED WITH A BUNDLE OF MAIL IN HIS HAND THE DETECTIVE'S FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY AS A SUSPECT MUCH WANTED BY THE NEW YORK POLICE BUT REASON ASSURED HIM THAT HE NOT ONLY HAD NO WARRANT FOR THIS
HE TOOK IT FOR THE INSTINCTIVE RECOGNITION IT UNDOUBTEDLY WAS HE THEREFORE WATCHED HIM NARROWLY AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE GLANCE FROM HIS EYE IT WAS ENOUGH THE MAN WAS COMMONPLACE COMMONPLACE IN FEATURE DRESS AND MANNER BUT HIS EYE GAVE HIM AWAY
AND TO RAISE BY PERSONAL SOLICITATION THE MONEY NEEDED FOR THESE ENTERPRISES REQUIRES AN UNUSUAL PERSONALITY FAITH COURAGE INSIGHT FORESIGHT THE POWER TO WIN AND THE ABILITY TO COMMAND
SEEKING SOME WAY IN WHICH HE COULD SATISFY HIS MEDICAL ASPIRATIONS AS WELL AS HIS DESIRE FOR ADVENTURE AND FOR DEFINITE CHRISTIAN WORK
ALL OF WHICH CONVINCED SWEETWATER THAT THE ENGLISHMAN'S ERRAND WAS IN CONNECTION WITH A MAN WHOM HE EQUALLY DREADED AND DESIRED TO MEET OF THIS HE WAS MADE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN A LITTLE LATER AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE DEPOT WITH THE REST OF THE ARRIVALS MISTER GREY SAID
BUT HOW WITH THE CONDITIONS LAID ON HIM BY MISTER GREY WAS THIS TO BE DONE
AND TRUMPETON WOOD SHALL ONCE AGAIN BE THE GLORY OF THE BRAKE HUNT
AND FOR THE HANDLING OF AFFAIRS QUITE APART FROM PERSONAL TENDANCE UPON THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HE SHOWED SUCH AN HONEST DESIRE TO FILL THE PLACE AND MADE OUT TO GIVE SUCH A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED FOR THE WORK BEFORE REACHING C
THAT THE MAN WHO ANSWERED TO THE NAME OF WELLGOOD
WAS BORN ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH DAY OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE AT MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL PARKGATE BY CHESTER ENGLAND OF AN ANCESTRY WHICH LAID A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR HIS CAREER AND IN SURROUNDINGS WHICH FITTED HIM FOR IT
BUT HE COULD HARDLY DO SO AND REMAIN A POPULAR MAGNATE IN ENGLAND IF HE CHOSE TO PUT HIMSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THE DESIRES AND VERY INSTINCTS OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HIS PROPERTY WAS SITUATED HE MUST LIVE AS A MAN FORBID THAT WAS THE GENERAL ARGUMENT
HE HAD LEARNED AS SUCH FELLOWS DO
AND IF HE HAD HAD ANOTHER FAIRBROTHER HOUSE EXPERIENCE HE REPLIED WITH A DECIDED NO THAT IT WAS NOT HIS ADVENTURE WHICH HAD UPSET HIM BUT THE NEWS HE HAD TO BRING
AND THEREIN HE LEARNED SOME OF HIS FIRST LESSONS IN THAT ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION ESSENTIAL TO HIS LATER LIFE WORK HERE IN THIS TRAINED BUT UNTRAMMELED BOYHOOD WITH AN INHERITED INCENTIVE TO LABOR AND AN EDUCATED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE
THE UTTER HELPLESSNESS OF THE MAN IN ALL PRACTICAL MATTERS AND HIS EXTREME ANXIETY TO SEE ALL THAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT HIM WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF SEEN THERE WAS METHOD IN THIS CURIOSITY TOO MUCH METHOD WOMEN DID NOT INTEREST HIM IN THE LEAST
THITHER CAME CHARLES KINGSLEY CANON OF CHESTER WHO MARRIED A GRENFELL AND WHO COUPLED HIS VERSE WITH SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND MADE GEOLOGICAL EXCURSIONS TO THE RIVER'S MOUTH WITH THE THEN MASTER OF MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL IN THESE EXCURSIONS THE YOUTHFUL WILFRED WAS A PARTICIPANT
MUST BE REINCARNATE IN OUR LIVES IF IT IS TO BE RECEIVED TO DAY THUS CAME ABOUT THE OUTFITTING OF THE ALBERT HOSPITAL SHIP TO CARRY THE MESSAGE AND THE HELP BY CRUISING AMONG THE FLEETS ON THE FISHING GROUNDS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DEEP SEA MISSION
IN WHICH CASE IT WAS DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY ON THE BRAKE HUNT IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO MASTERS SUBSCRIBERS OWNERS OF COVERTS OR FARMERS UNLESS A DIFFERENT ORDER OF THINGS SHOULD BE MADE TO PREVAIL IN REGARD TO TRUMPETON WOOD
TO MAKE OF THE SCATTERED SETTLEMENTS A UNITED AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE TO SAFEGUARD THEIR FUTURE BY SUCH MEASURES AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEAMEN'S INSTITUTE AT SAINT JOHN'S NEWFOUNDLAND AND THE INSURANCE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD
ENCOURAGES THRIFT AND ADMINISTERS JUSTICE AND ADDS TO THE WAGE EARNING CAPACITY AND THEREFORE FOOD OBTAINING POWER BY OPERATING A SAWMILL A SCHOONER BUILDING YARD AND OTHER PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
BECAME ASSISTANT MASTER AT REPTON AND LATER WHEN HE MARRIED HEAD MASTER OF MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL A POSITION WHICH HE RESIGNED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO BECOME CHAPLAIN OF THE LONDON HOSPITAL HE WAS A MAN OF MUCH LEARNING WITH A KEEN INTEREST IN SCIENCE
AND ARMED WITH DEFINITE INFORMATION HE APPEARED BEFORE MISTER GREY WHO TO HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS DINING IN HIS OWN ROOM HE HAD DISMISSED THE WAITER AND WAS RATHER BROODING THAN EATING HE LOOKED UP EAGERLY HOWEVER WHEN SWEETWATER ENTERED AND ASKED WHAT NEWS
THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED BY SOME TO BE SEARS HIMSELF IN THIS WAY HE WOULD SOON BE LOOKING UPON THE VERY MAN WHOSE STEPS HE HAD FOLLOWED THROUGH THE FAIRBROTHER HOUSE A FEW NIGHTS BEFORE AND THROUGH WHOSE RESOLUTE ACTION HE HAD VERY NEARLY RUN THE RISK OF A LINGERING DEATH FROM STARVATION
MOST NOBLE VICE CHANCELLOR AND YOU EMINENT PROCTORS A CITIZEN OF BRITAIN IS BEFORE YOU ONCE A STUDENT IN THIS UNIVERSITY NOW BETTER KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW WORLD THAN TO OUR OWN
THIS WAS A GREAT STROKE OF LUCK HE THOUGHT BUT HE LITTLE KNEW HOW BIG A STROKE OR INTO WHAT A SERIES OF ADVENTURES IT WAS GOING TO LEAD HIM ONCE ON THE PLATFORM OF THE SMALL STATION AT WHICH MISTER GREY HAD BIDDEN HIM TO STOP HE NOTICED TWO THINGS
THIS DONE HE SO IMPROVED HIS OPPORTUNITY THAT THE TWO WERE SOON ON THE BEST OF TERMS AND HE LEARNED THAT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS WITHOUT A VALET AND BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT WITHOUT ONE FELT THE AWKWARDNESS OF HIS POSITION VERY MUCH THIS GAVE SWEETWATER HIS CUE
THEN THE DRUGS ORDERED BY WHOLESALE THOSE BOXES OVER THERE WERE HIS READY TO BE CARTED OUT TO HIS MANUFACTORY COUNT THEM SOME ONE AND THINK OF THE BOTTLES AND BOTTLES OF STUFF THEY STAND FOR IF IT SELLS AS HE SAYS IT WILL THEN HE WILL SOON BE RICH AND SO ON
HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN TOWN AND WAS SOMEWHAT OF A STRANGER YET BUT HE WOULDN'T BE SO LONG HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THINGS HUM HE WAS MONEY FOR THIS MONEY FOR THAT A HORSE WHERE ANOTHER MAN WOULD WALK AND MAIL WELL THAT ALONE WOULD MAKE THIS POST OFFICE WORTH WHILE
AWAY FROM THE THRALL OF CROWDED COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO THE WILD PLACES OF NATURE WITH THE SEA ALWAYS BECKONING AND A ROCKING BOAT AS FAMILIAR AS THE LAND IT IS SMALL WONDER THAT THERE GREW THE FASHIONING OF THE PURPOSE OF A MAN DIMLY AT FIRST
YOU'LL COME TO US IN THE WINTER MISTER FINN I SHOULD LIKE YOU MUST NO ONE WAS TRUER TO YOU THAN WE WERE YOU KNOW INDEED REGARDING YOU AS WE DO HOW SHOULD WE NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME THAT MY OLD FRIEND SHOULD HAVE BEEN OH LADY CHILTERN
I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY INDEED TO PUT THE DUKE TO ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENSE SAID LORD CHILTERN SOLEMNLY STILL FEARING THAT THE DUCHESS WAS ONLY PLAYING WITH HIM IT MADE HIM ANGRY THAT HE COULD NOT IMBUE OTHER PEOPLE WITH HIS IDEA OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMUSEMENT OF A WHOLE COUNTY
EVEN WHEN CUB HUNTING REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS BED AT THREE A M HE WAS CONSTANT AT HIS KENNEL
AND SO THE GREAT MISTER FOTHERGILL FALLS FROM POWER AND GOES DOWN INTO OBSCURITY SAID MADAME GOESLER HE WAS AN IMPUDENT OLD MAN AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SAID THE DUCHESS AND HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY THOROUGH DETESTATION
GRENVILLE TREVANION SLANNING GODOLPHIN SLAIN THERE WAS ALSO SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE IMMORTALIZED BY TENNYSON IN THE REVENGE AND JOHN PASCOE GRENVILLE THE RIGHT HAND MAN OF ADMIRAL COCHRANE
A DANGEROUS CUSTOMER THOUGHT HE
AND HIS ATHLETICS SERVED TO STRENGTHEN HIS APPEALS TO THE LONDON BOYS WHOM HE ENROLLED IN THE BRIGADES HE FOUNDED THE INTER HOSPITAL ROWING CLUB AT PUTNEY AND ROWED IN THE FIRST INTER HOSPITAL RACE HE PLAYED ON THE VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM AND WON THE THROWING THE HAMMER AT THE SPORTS
AND REENTERING THE STORE HE TOOK UP HIS STAND NEAR THE SUGAR BARREL HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT IN THE PAUSES OF WEIGHING AND TASTING DICK TALKED IF HE WERE GUIDED WITH SUITABLE DISCRETION WHY SHOULD HE NOT TALK OF WELLGOOD HE WAS GUIDED AND HE DID TALK AND TO SOME EFFECT
THEN HE BEGAN TO HUNT FOR A HOTEL NOT TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT HE WISHED AND INSTALLED THE ENGLISHMAN IN HIS ROOM DID HE VENTURE TO OPEN THE PRECIOUS MEMORANDUM AND READ THE NAME HE HAD BEEN SPECULATING OVER FOR AN HOUR IT WAS NOT THE ONE HE HAD ANTICIPATED BUT IT CAME NEAR TO IT
THAT IS HIS BUGGY STANDING BEFORE THE DRUG STORE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY SO HE HAD NETTED JONES QUONDAM WAITER AT THE FIRST CAST LUCKY WAS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF STILL LUCKY SAUNTERING TO THE DOOR HE WATCHED FOR THE OWNER OF THAT BUGGY
ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE FOUR OF HER BROTHERS WERE GENERALS OR COLONELS IN THE TRYING TIMES OF SERVICE IN INDIA THE ELDEST FOUGHT WITH DISTINCTION THROUGHOUT THE INDIAN MUTINY AND IN THE DEFENCE OF LUCKNOW
A STRANGER THAT YOUNG MAN PUT IN VOLUBLY LOOKING FOR JAMES WELLGOOD
THERE WAS NOTHING COMMONPLACE IN THAT IT WAS AN EYE TO BEWARE OF HE HAD TAKEN IN SWEETWATER AS HE PASSED BUT SWEETWATER WAS OF A COMMONPLACE TYPE TOO AND WOKE NO CORRESPONDING DREAD IN THE OTHER'S MIND
AND A FINE CLASSICAL SCHOLAR WHOSE ELDER AND YOUNGER BROTHERS EACH FELT THE ANCESTRAL CALL OF THE SEA AND BECAME ADMIRALS WITH BRAVE RECORDS OF DARING AND SUCCESS DOCTOR GRENFELL'S FATHER AFTER A BRILLIANT CAREER AT RUGBY SCHOOL AND AT BALLIOL COLLEGE OXFORD
AND MANUFACTURES HIS OWN CONCOCTIONS IN A HOUSE HE HAS RENTED HERE ON A LONELY ROAD SOME HALF MILE OUT OF TOWN WELLGOOD DOES THE MAN NAMED WELLGOOD MISTER GREY EXCLAIMED WITH ALL THE ASTONISHMENT THE OTHER SECRETLY EXPECTED YES WELLGOOD JAMES WELLGOOD THERE IS NO OTHER IN TOWN
TO KILL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FOXES IN THE YEAR AFTER THE LEGITIMATE FASHION HAD BECOME TO HIM THE ONE GREAT STUDY OF LIFE AND HE DID IT WITH AN ENERGY EQUAL TO THAT WHICH THE DUKE DEVOTED TO DECIMAL COINAGE HIS HUNTSMAN WAS ALWAYS WELL MOUNTED WITH TWO HORSES
THE DUKE'S PROPERTY INDEED SURELY ALL THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLAND BY THIS TIME NOW HE HAD CONSENTED TO COME TO MATCHING BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM IN ORDER THAT THE MATTER MIGHT BE SETTLED THERE HAD BEEN A THREAT THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP THE COUNTRY
WE MAY HAVE TRAPS IF WE LIKE IT LORD CHILTERN CERTAINLY ONLY SAY SO AND WE SHALL KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND POOR LADY CHILTERN WAS COVERED WITH DISMAY THE DUKE CAN DESTROY THE HUNT IF HE PLEASES NO DOUBT SAID THE LORD BUT WE DON'T LIKE TRAPS LORD CHILTERN
IT WAS THAT OF JAMES WELLGOOD SATISFIED NOW THAT HE HAD A TICKLISH MATTER TO HANDLE HE PREPARED FOR IT WITH HIS USUAL ENTHUSIASM AND CIRCUMSPECTION
A FEW DAYS LATER THREE MEN WERE CLOSETED IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TWO OF THEM WERE OFFICIALS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIMSELF AND OUR OLD FRIEND THE INSPECTOR THE THIRD WAS THE DETECTIVE SWEETWATER CHOSEN BY THEM TO KEEP WATCH ON MISTER GREY SWEETWATER HAD JUST COME TO TOWN
THE EXISTING TRAFFIC IN SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS AND IN ALL OTHER DEMORALIZING INFLUENCES HAD TO BE FOUGHT STEP BY STEP PREJUDICE AND EVIL HABIT HAD TO BE OVERCOME AND TO BE REPLACED BY BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND BETTER DESIRE THERE WAS ROOM FOR BOTH FIGHTING AND TEACHING
AMONG THEM GENERAL FRANCIS WALLACE GRENFELL LORD KILVEY AND BY DOCTOR GRENFELL HIMSELF ON THE LABRADOR IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DISEASE AND DISASTER AND DISTRESS ALONG A STORMY AND UNCHARTED COAST
NOT LONG SINCE A GENTLEMAN SHOT A FOX RUNNING ACROSS A WOODLAND RIDE IN A HUNTING COUNTRY HE HAD MISTAKEN IT FOR A HARE AND HAD DONE THE DEED IN THE PRESENCE OF KEEPERS OWNER AND FRIENDS
A COUPLE OF TERMS AT QUEEN'S COLLEGE OXFORD FOLLOWED THE LONDON EXPERIENCE BUT HERE THE CONDITIONS WERE TOO EASY AND LUXURIOUS FOR ONE WHO BY BOTH INHERITANCE AND TRAINING HAD WITHIN HIM THE INCENTIVE TO THE STRENUOUS LIFE NEED CALLED MISERY APPEALED
AND THEN THERE WAS THE ARGUMENT SPECIAL TO THIS PARTICULAR CASE AS IT HAPPENED TRUMPETON WOOD WAS AND ALWAYS HAD BEEN THE GREAT NURSERY OF FOXES FOR THAT SIDE OF THE BRAKE COUNTRY GORSE COVERTS MAKE NO DOUBT THE CHARM OF HUNTING
THERE IS SOMETHING DOUBTLESS ABSURD IN THE INTENSITY OF THE WORSHIP PAID TO THE FOX BY HUNTING COMMUNITIES THE ANIMAL BECOMES SACRED AND HIS PRESERVATION IS A RELIGION HIS IRREGULAR DESTRUCTION IS A PROFANITY AND WORDS SPOKEN TO HIS INJURY ARE BLASPHEMOUS
I VOTE THAT WE HAVE AN OFFICER OF STATE TO GO IN AND OUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH A SEAT IN THE CABINET OR NOT ACCORDING AS THINGS GO
BUT LORD CHILTERN WOULD GIVE UP HIS OWN TO THE MAN AND TAKE CHARGE OF A WEARY ANIMAL AS A COMMON GROOM WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE MIGHT THUS FURTHER THE OBJECT OF THE DAY'S SPORT HE WORKED AS MEN WORK ONLY AT PLEASURE HE NEVER MISSED A DAY
IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE FINDS NO SPORT HIMSELF AND WHICH ARE HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL TO ANOTHER SPORT IN WHICH HE TAKES PERHAPS THE KEENEST INTEREST TRUMPETON WOOD WAS THE DUKE'S OWN TO DO JUST AS HE PLEASED WITH IT WHY SHOULD FOXES BE DEMANDED FROM HIM THEN
TO ORDINARY THINKERS TO UNPREJUDICED OUTSIDERS TO AMERICANS LET US SAY OR FRENCHMEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ROOM EVEN FOR AN ARGUMENT BY WHAT LAW OF GOD OR MAN CAN A MAN BE BOUND TO MAINTAIN A PARCEL OF INJURIOUS VERMIN ON HIS PROPERTY
ON THE NEXT DAY LORD AND LADY CHILTERN WENT BACK TO HARRINGTON HALL WHEN THE END OF AUGUST COMES A MASTER OF HOUNDS WHO IS REALLY A MASTER IS WANTED AT HOME
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD CONFERRED THE HONORARY DEGREE IN MEDICINE WITH THESE FITTING WORDS WAS PRESENTED A MAN WHOSE SIMPLE FAITH HAS BEEN THE MOTIVE POWER OF HIS WORKS TO WHOM PAIN AND WEARINESS OF FLESH HAVE CALLED NO STAY
BUT HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BROUGHT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH LORD CHILTERN AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY THE DUCHESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE MUST PREVENT ANY SUCH AWKWARDNESS AND SHE DID PREVENT IT AND NOW LORD CHILTERN SHE SAID HOW ABOUT THE FOXES
HOPING THAT IN SPITE OF THE SACRILEGE COMMITTED HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FACE A WORLD THAT WOULD BE IGNORANT OF HIS CRIME AS THE VULPICIDE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY OF THE DEED WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HIS ROOM ONE MAID SERVANT WHISPERED TO ANOTHER AND THE POOR VICTIM OF AN IMPERFECT SIGHT
AS IT STANDS TO DAY THE MISSION TO DEEP SEA FISHERMEN WHICH DOCTOR GRENFELL REPRESENTS ADMINISTERS AND ANIMATES ON THE LABRADOR COAST NOT ONLY BRINGS HOPE NEW COURAGE AND SPIRITUAL COMFORT TO AN ISOLATED PEOPLE IN A DESOLATE LAND
SIX HUNDRED MILES OF ALMOST BARREN ROCK WITH OUTLYING UNCHARTED LEDGES WORN SMOOTH BY ICE ELSE STILL MORE VESSELS WOULD HAVE FOUND WRECKAGE THERE A SCANT CONSTANT POPULATION OF HARDY FISHERMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES
THE DUKE HOWEVER HAD DECLINED TO INTERFERE PERSONALLY HE HAD TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO WELCOME LORD AND LADY CHILTERN AS HE WOULD ANY OTHER FRIENDS OF HERS THE GUESTS INDEED AT THE DUKE'S HOUSE WERE NEVER HIS GUESTS BUT ALWAYS HERS
BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS HIMSELF PECULIAR AND HE RESPECTED THE HABITS OF OTHERS IT HAD FALLEN OUT IN THIS WISE AS THE OLD DUKE HAD BECOME VERY OLD
THAT IS HE GAVE INFORMATION OF THE MAN WHICH SURPRISED SWEETWATER IF IN THE PAST AND IN NEW YORK HE HAD BEEN KNOWN AS A WAITER OR SHOULD I SAY STEWARD HE WAS KNOWN HERE AS A MANUFACTURER OF PATENT MEDICINE DESIGNED TO REJUVENATE THE HUMAN RACE
PIOUS AND GOD FEARING MOST OF THEM BUT LARGELY AT THE MERCY OF THE LOCAL TRADERS WHO TOOK THEIR PAY IN FISH FOR THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIVING WITH A LARGE ACCOUNT ALWAYS ON THE TRADER'S SIDE WITH SUCH MEDICAL AID AND MINISTRATION AS CAME ONLY OCCASIONALLY BY THE INFREQUENT MAIL BOAT
RENOWNED SURGEON AND DARING SAILOR AND MASTER MARINER AS WELL WITH PLENTY OF WORK TO THE FORE AS A HOSPITAL INTERNE THE RULING SPIRIT STILL ASSERTED ITSELF AND THE YOUNG DOCTOR BECAME AN INSPIRATION AMONG THE WAIFS OF THE TEEMING CITY
WITHOUT HIS GETTING ANY SORT OF A LOOK AT ME DO THIS AND YOU WILL EARN A WEEK'S SALARY IN ONE DAY SWEETWATER WITH HIS HEAD IN AIR AND HIS HEART ON FIRE FOR MATTERS WERE LOOKING VERY PROMISING INDEED TOOK THE PAPER AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
IF ALL FOXES SO WANDERING BE DOOMED TO DEATH IF POISON AND WIRES AND TRAPS AND HOSTILE KEEPERS AWAIT THEM THERE INSTEAD OF THE TENDER WELCOME OF THE LOVING FOX PRESERVER
AFTER THIS WHIMSICAL MANNER SHE LAVISHED PRESENTS UPON HER WHENEVER SHE HAD A NEW FANCY IN TRUTH HER GENEROSITY WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND SHE HAD BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH TOWARD PAMELA BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO EXTRAVAGANT AS SHE WAS WITH THEODORA
TO BID HIM GOOD NIGHT BRIGHT AS THE FUTURE WAS IT LEFT A SENSE OF DISCOMFORT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY HE DISMISSED THE CARRIAGE AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET FEELING FAIRLY DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS HE HAD PERHAPS NEVER GIVEN THE GIRL A THOUGHT BEFORE
BUT THEODORA HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIM THE MOMENT SHE SAW HIM SHE STOOD UP BLUSHING AND WITH A LIGHT IN HER EYES IT WAS ODD HOW UN ENGLISH SHE LOOKED AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY ENGLISH SHE WAS IN THAT DELICIOUS UNCOMFORTABLE TRICK
RUN ON IN A GAY STREAM OF CHATTER ALTOGETHER SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY AND JOYOUS THAT HER ESCORT WAS FAIN TO BE DELIGHTED TOO GUESS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO FIRST
THE TWO HAD ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SOME YEARS AGO WHEN DENIS HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS IN HIS PALMIEST DAYS IN FACT MY LADY HAD PICKED HIM UP WHEN HE STOOD IN SORE NEED OF FRIENDS AND OGLETHORPE NEVER FORGOT A FAVOR
AT SEVENTEEN PRISCILLA GOWER HAD ASSISTED HER MAIDEN AUNT'S LODGER TO COPY HIS MANUSCRIPT WITH AS MATURE A GRAVITY AS SHE WOULD HAVE DISPLAYED TO DAY I HOPE SAID THEODORA WHEN AFTER THEIR SIGHT SEEING WAS OVER
HE WAS CARELESS TO A FAULT IN SOME THINGS AND PUNCTILIOUS TO A FAULT IN OTHERS AND HE WAS VERY PUNCTILIOUS ABOUT PRISCILLA GOWER HE WAS NOT AN ARDENT LOVER BUT HE WAS A CONSCIENTIOUSLY HONORABLE ONE
SHE WAS ONLY A MERE CHILD AFTER ALL AT SIXTEEN WITH DOWNPORT IN THE BACKGROUND SO HE FELT QUITE HONESTLY AT EASE IN BEING ATTENTIVE TO HER GIRLISH REQUIREMENTS BETTER THAT HE SHOULD AMUSE HER
IT WOULD BE SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL HE SAID I SHOULD LIKE IT BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TOO WE WILL APPEAL TO LADY THROCKMORTON WHEN PRISCILLA WAS IN LONDON THEODORA WAS BEGINNING A MINUTE LATER
LADY THROCKMORTON WAS IN HER PRIVATE ROOM WHEN HE CAME AND AS HE MADE HIS ENTRANCE WITH AS LITTLE CEREMONY AS USUAL HE RAN IN UPON THEODORA NOW TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD UNTIL THIS MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT YOUNG PERSON'S VERY EXISTENCE
THE MOST BRILLIANT OF WITTICISMS HE PAID HER HIS FIRST COMPLIMENT THE NIGHT THE ROSE COLORED SATIN DRESS CAME HOME THEY WERE GOING TO SEE FAUST TOGETHER WITH LADY THROCKMORTON AND SHE HAD FINISHED DRESSING EARLY AND CAME DOWN TO THE DRAWING ROOM
HAD FADED INTO LESS STRIKING COLOR IT WAS ONLY A GIRL'S FACE AGAIN HE WAS ON BETTER TERMS WITH HIMSELF AND HIS WEAKNESS SEEMED LESS FORMIDABLE I WILL KEEP MY PROMISE TO MORROW HE SAID AND PRISCILLA SHALL GO WITH US POOR PRISCILLA POOR GIRL
HE SAW SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS IN A DAY'S ROUND AND HE WAS SO OFTEN TOO BUSY TO NOTICE HALF OF THEM THOUGH HE WAS AN ADMIRER OF PRETTY GIRLS THAT IT WAS NOTHING NEW TO SEE ONE AND FORGET HER UNTIL CHANCE THREW THEM TOGETHER AGAIN OF COURSE
IN HIS SURPRISE HE FORGOT HIS SELF POSSESSION HE TURNED UPON HER SUDDENLY AND MEETING HER SWEET WORLD IGNORANT EYES FELT THE FAINT PAINED SHOCK ONCE MORE AND STRANGELY ENOUGH HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS A DISCONNECTED ONE OF PRISCILLA GOWER YOU
AND SUFFERED A SUDDEN SHOCK OF ENTHUSIASM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT HE WAS STARTLED AND DISCOMFITED SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO WIN SUCH ADMIRATION FROM HIM HE HAD NO RIGHT TO GIVE IT BUT AS HIS WALK IN THE NIGHT AIR COOLED HIM
THEODORA WAS AN ACTUAL BEAUTY OF AN UNCOMMON TYPE IN THE FACE OF HER IGNORANCE OF MANNERS AND CUSTOMS PAMELA HAD NEVER AT HER BEST BEEN MORE THAN A DELICATELY PRETTY GIRL IN THE MEANTIME DENIS OGLETHORPE MADE FRIENDLY CALLS AS USUAL
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY BECAME FRIENDS PRISCILLA GRAVELY AND WITHOUT ANY HESITATION VOLUNTEERED TO HELP HIM SHE COULD COPY WELL AND CLEARLY AND HE COULD COME INTO HER AUNT'S ROOM IT WOULD SAVE FIRES SO SHE HELPED HIM CALMLY AND DECOROUSLY
IT COOLED HIS ARDOR OF SELF EXAMINATION SOMEWHAT HIS DISCONTENT WAS MODIFIED BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN DOOR AND TOOK HIS LATCH KEY OUT OF HIS POCKET THE FACE THAT HAD LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM BENEATH THE LIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR CASE
TO TUCK THEODORA'S SMALL GLOVED HAND UNDER HIS ARM WHEN THEY SET OUT ON THEIR TOUR OF INVESTIGATION AND DISCOVERY THE GIRL WAS PRETTY ENOUGH TOO IN HER SOFT BLACK MERINO HER BEST DRESS IN DOWNPORT BUT SHE WAS NOT DAZZLING
HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO FIND THE GIRL SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED SO MODEST IN A SWEET WAY IT WAS EASY AS WELL AS PROPER ENOUGH TO TALK TO HER UNCEREMONIOUSLY WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF BEING DIFFUSE AND COMPLIMENTARY SO HE MADE HIMSELF AGREEABLE
AND ALWAYS MEETING THEODORA FOUND HER VERY PLEASANT TO TALK TO AND LOOK AT HE FOUND OUT HER ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION FOR THE POETIC EFFUSIONS OF HIS YOUTH AND IN CONSIDERATION THEREOF GOOD HUMOREDLY PRESENTED HER WITH A COPY OF THE VOLUME
WHY WAS IT THAT HE WAS IMPELLED TO SUCH A PUERILE WEAKNESS SUCH A VANITY AS HE STERNLY CALLED IT BECAUSE RETURNED THEO IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I MEAN
AND HER DISCOMFORT WAS RAPIDLY INCREASING HE MUST THINK HER DREADFULLY STUPID THOUGH HE WAS GOOD HUMORED ENOUGH TO MAKE LIGHT OF HER SILLY SPEECH CERTAINLY PRISCILLA NEVER MADE SUCH A SILLY SPEECH IN HER LIFE BUT THEN
IT NEEDED NOTHING MORE THAN THIS SIMPLE SLIP OF THEODORA NORTH'S TONGUE TO ASSURE HIM THAT LADY THROCKMORTON HAD BEEN TELLING HER THE STORY OF HIS ENGAGEMENT TO MISS GOWER AND AS MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED HE WAS NOT AS DEVOUTLY GRATEFUL TO HER LADYSHIP AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HAD AMOUNTED TO A VERY EXCELLENT JOKE DOES HE HE RETURNED AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN HIS GLANCE MEETING THEO'S SHE BROKE INTO A LITTLE BURST OF HORROR STRICKEN SELF REPROACH OH DEAR
SHE WAS SO ABASHED AT HER BLUNDER THAT SHE LOOKED ABSOLUTELY IMPLORING AND MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED AGAIN HE FELT INCLINED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THEODORA THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL STAYING AT LADY THROCKMORTON'S HE HAD SAID TO PRISCILLA
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PROOFS AND PRINTERS AND PRISCILLA BUT WHEN AFTER RUNNING LIGHTLY UP THE STAIR CASE HE OPENED THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND SAW A TALL
SHE EXCLAIMED I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE SAID THAT OUGHT I I FORGOT HOW RUDE IT WOULD SOUND BUT INDEED I ONLY MEANT THAT SABRE WAS SO SLOW AND HEAVY AND AND SO INDIFFERENT TO PEOPLE SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK HE CARES ABOUT BEING LIKED AT ALL
OGLETHORPE JUNIOR WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT OGLETHORPE SENIOR HAD BEEN AND NOTWITHSTANDING HER PRACTICAL VIEWS LADY THROCKMORTON LIKED HIM NONE THE WORSE FOR IT SHE PETTED AND PATRONIZED HIM QUESTIONED AND ADVISED HIM AND IF HE DID NOT PLEASE HER
THE PROMISE HE HAD MADE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A RATIFICATION OF THE OLD ONE THEY WERE TO SEE THE LIONS TOGETHER AND PRISCILLA WAS TO GUIDE THEM AND WHEN THE MORROW CAME HE FOUND IT AFTER ALL SAFE ENOUGH AND AN EASY ENOUGH MATTER
BENDING HER ALMOST AUSTERELY HANDSOME YOUNG HEAD OVER HIS PAPERS FOR HOURS ON THE LONG WINTER NIGHTS IT IS EASY TO GUESS HOW THE MATTER TERMINATED IF EVER HE WON SUCCESS HE DETERMINED TO GIVE IT TO PRISCILLA AND SO HE TOLD HER
BUT HE HAD BEEN TIRED AND FAGGED OUT HE REMEMBERED ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF THEIR MEETING TOO TIRED TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT HIS APPOINTMENT AT BROOME STREET AND PRISCILLA'S GREEK GRAMMAR AND NOW IN RECOGNIZING WHAT HE HAD BEFORE PASSED BY
MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED FAINTLY HE WAS NOT VERY FOND OF SIR DUGALD
SENT HIM HOME CONFRONTING A SUDDENLY RAISED SPIRIT OF PAIN TWICE IN ONE NIGHT HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF FEELING TOWARD THEODORA NORTH AS HE HAD NEVER FELT TOWARD PRISCILLA GOWER IN HIS LIFE TWICE IN ONE NIGHT HE HAD TURNED HIS EYES UPON THIS GIRL OF SIXTEEN
THE FACT THAT DENIS HAD SPOKEN OF HER ADMIRINGLY WAS SUFFICIENT TO AROUSE IN HER MIND AN INTEREST IN THIS YOUNG CREATURE WHO WAS AT ONCE AND SO INCONSISTENTLY BEAUTIFUL TIMID AND REGAL WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS
SOFT WHITE RUFF AND ALL AS HE BUTTONED UP HIS PALETOT OVER HIS CHEST IN WALKING HOMEWARD BUT HE THOUGHT OF HER CARELESSLY AND HONESTLY ENOUGH AS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG CREATURE YEARS BEHIND HIM IN EXPERIENCE
UNLESS WHEN CHANCE HAD THROWN THEM TOGETHER
THREE YEARS MORE WILL MAKE HER SOMETHING WONDERFUL AS FAR AS BEAUTY IS CONCERNED HE HAD SAID AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD FELT SOME SLIGHT PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION OF SEEING HER YET THEO HAD SOME FAINT MISGIVINGS DURING THE DAY
AND UTTERLY BEYOND HIM IN ALL POSSIBILITY OF ANY SENTIMENTAL FANCY THE FRIENDSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN LADY THROCKMORTON AND THIS YOUNG MAN WAS A QUEER INCONSISTENT SENTIMENT ENOUGH AND YET WAS A FRIENDSHIP AND A MATURE ONE
WITH SOME VERY WITTY VERSES WRITTEN ON THE FLY LEAF IN A FLOURISHING HAND IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO AMUSE THEODORA SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND UNASSUMING IN HER DELIGHT AT HIS CARELESSLY AMIABLE EFFORTS FOR HER ENTERTAINMENT
QUERIED THEO WHY NOT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ASK LADY THROCKMORTON HE SAID BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO MISS PRISCILLA GOWER IS THEODORA HER BRIGHT EYES CREPT UP TO HIS HALF TIMIDLY BUT SHE SAID NOTHING SO HE CONTINUED
THE THOUGHT ENTERED THEO'S MIND THAT SHE COULD COMPREHEND DIMLY WHY LADY THROCKMORTON DISLIKED HER AND THOUGHT HER UNSUITED TO DENIS OGLETHORPE THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF ANYTHING GIRL LIKE IN HER FINE IVORY PALE FACE SOMEHOW
A RELATIVE OF HERS A PRETTY CREATURE TOO PRISCILLA FOR A BREAD AND BUTTER MISS BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF THE MATTER WHAT TENDER SPEECHFUL EYES SHE HAD HE WAS AROUSED TO A RECOGNITION OF THEIR BEAUTY ALL AT ONCE
AND THEODORA LISTENED UNTIL SHE QUITE FORGOT SIR DUGALD AND ONLY REMEMBERED SABRE BECAUSE HIS BIG HEAVY HEAD WAS ON HER KNEE AND SHE WAS STROKING IT AND YOU WERE NEVER IN LONDON BEFORE HE SAID AT LENGTH NO SIR THEO ANSWERED
MISS PRISCILLA GOWER IS THE YOUNG LADY TO WHOM I AM TO BE MARRIED NEXT JULY DID YOU KNOW THAT YES ANSWERED THEO LOOKING ACTUALLY PLEASED AND BLUSHING BEAUTIFULLY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER BUT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR TELLING ME MISTER OGLETHORPE
I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FINE SPEECH TO THEODORA HE SAID TO LADY THROCKMORTON WHEN SHE CAME IN AND SHE DOES NOT COMPREHEND IT IN THE LEAST
BUT FREE FROM ANY TOUCH OF LIGHT GALLANTRY AS HIS MANNER TOWARD THE GIRL WAS DENIS OGLETHORPE DID NOT FORGET HER THIS NIGHT ON THE CONTRARY HE REMEMBERED HER VERY DISTINCTLY AND HAD IN HIS MIND A VERY EXACT MENTAL REPRESENTATION OF HER PURPLE ROBE
THAT THEODORA NORTH WAS NEARLY A WOMAN BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM NOW WITH ALL THE GREATER FORCE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN SO OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT BEFORE HE SAT BY HER SIDE UNTIL THE CURTAIN FELL BUT HIS SILENT MOOD SEEMED TO HAVE COME UPON HIM AGAIN
BENDING OVER SABRE AND STROKING HIS HUGE TAWNY HEAD WITH HER SUPPLE LITTLE TENDER HAND HE REMEMBERED AH YES HE EXCLAIMED IN AN ADMIRING ASIDE TO BE SURE I HAD FORGOTTEN THEODORA
ALL PRISCILLA'S SMILES WERE LIKE MOONLIGHT THEO'S HAD A DELICIOUS GLOW OF THE SUN YES SHE SAID IN HER PRACTICAL MANNER IT WILL PLEASE ME VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU MISS THEODORA COME AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN SPARE THE TIME
SHE ONLY FELT SOMEWHAT CONFUSED AND RATHER GLAD THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAD SURPRISED HER BY COMING AGAIN HOW MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WOULD HAVE SMILED IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT AN INNOCENT COMMOTION HIS SIMPLE PRESENCE CREATED
AND IN DENIS OGLETHORPE'S LOVE AFFAIR PROPINQUITY HAD ACCOMPLISHED WHAT NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO HAVE DONE THE DESPERATE YOUNG SCRIBBLER OF TWENTY YEARS HAD BEEN THE LODGER OF THE ELDER MISS GOWER AND PRISCILLA AGED SEVENTEEN HAD BROUGHT IN HIS FRUGAL DINNERS TO HIM
MISS ELIZABETH GOWER HERSELF WAS THERE IN HER COMPANY CAP AND LONG CHERISHED COMPANY DRESS OF SNUFF COLORED SATIN THERE WERE NOT MANY SHADES OF DIFFERENCE IN EITHER HER SNUFF COLORED GOWN OR HER SNUFF COLORED SKIN OR HER NEAT SNUFF COLORED FALSE FRONT
WHEN THE HANDSOME FACE CHANGED SUDDENLY AS HER COMPANION TURNED UPON HER IN EVIDENT SURPRISE PRISCILLA HE REPEATED AFTER HER
HE NEVER FORGOT TO BE GRATEFUL TO LADY THROCKMORTON AND SO DESPITE THE WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE AGES AND POSITIONS THEIR MUTUAL LIKING HAD RIPENED INTO A FAMILIARITY OF RELATIONSHIP WHICH MADE THEM MORE LIKE ELDER SISTER AND YOUNGER BROTHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
HE HAD SUCH AN ECCENTRIC FASHION OF BEING ALMOST CURT SOMETIMES SHE HAD SEEN HIM ACTUALLY GIVE A FAINT START WHEN HE ENTERED AND SHE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT
SHE WAS QUITE SURE IT HAD BEEN MARGUERITE YES I THINK SO SHE FALTERED POOR MARGUERITE IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE SAVED HIM HOW HE ASKED I DON'T AT LEAST I SCARCELY KNOW BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR OUGHT TO HAVE MADE HER SAVE HIM SOMEWAY
I WAS NEVER EVEN OUT OF DOWNPORT BEFORE THEN WE MUST TAKE YOU TO SEE THE LIONS HE SAID IF LADY THROCKMORTON WILL LET US MISS THEODORA I WONDER IF SHE WOULD LET US IF SHE WOULD I HAVE A LADY FRIEND WHO KNOWS THEM ALL FROM THE GRISLIEST DOWNWARD
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FAINT SHOCK OF DELIGHT ON FIRST BEHOLDING HER HE HAD JUST LEFT PRISCILLA PALE AND HEAVY EYED IN DUN COLORED MERINO PORING OVER A GREEK DICTIONARY AND THE SUDDEN ENTERING THE BRIGHT ROOM
AND APART FROM HIS RESPECT FOR HIS BETROTHED HE WAS VERY IMPATIENT OF INTERFERENCE WITH HIS AFFAIRS AND MY LADY WAS NOT CHARY OF INTERFERING WHEN THE FANCY SEIZED HER IT ROUSED HIS PRIDE TO THINK HOW LIBERALLY HE MUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND CONSEQUENTLY
IF IF SHE COULD HAVE SUFFERED SOMETHING OR SACRIFICED SOMETHING WOULD SHE HAVE DONE IT IF SHE COULD COMMENTED DENIS LANGUIDLY HE HAD QUITE RECOVERED HIMSELF BY THIS TIME I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF I HAD BEEN MARGUERITE THEO HALF WHISPERED
AND I KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO HELP ME TO EXHIBIT THEM TO YOU HOW SHOULD YOU LIKE THAT BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD GLOWING WITH DELIGHTED SURPRISE IF IT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE SHE ADDED QUITE APOLOGETICALLY MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SMILED
HOW COULD ONE TEACH FRENCH AND LATIN AND BE ANYTHING BUT PONDEROUSLY DISCREET MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS NOT THINKING OF PRISCILLA'S WISDOM HOWEVER HE WAS THINKING OF THEODORA NORTH HE WAS THINKING THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BLIND
SHE GLANCED UP INTO HIS FACE BRIGHTLY SHE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT HIS LADY FRIEND
AND WAS AT LEAST GENEROUS TO LAVISHNESS IN HER TREATMENT OF HER YOU ARE VERY HANDSOME INDEED THEODORA SHE SAID TO HER A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT
SAID MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE I WOULD NOT DISTURB HER ON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I KNOW SHE WILL BE DOWN DIRECTLY SHE NEVER READS LATE IN THE EVENING THIS IS A VERY HANDSOME DOG MISS NORTH VERY HANDSOME INDEED WAS THEO'S REPLY COME HERE SABRE
AND RECEIPTED HIS MODEST BILLS ON THEIR WEEKLY PAYMENT PRISCILLA AT SEVENTEEN SILENT PRACTICAL GRAVE AND HANDSOME HAD PERHAPS SOFTENED UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OFTEN PALE FACE HE WORKED SO HARD AND SO FAR INTO THE NIGHT
OF BLUSHING VIVIDLY UPON ALL OCCASIONS SHE WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE PURPLE CLOTH WAS SO BECOMING AND THAT ITS SWEEP OF STRAIGHT HEAVY FOLDS MADE HER AS STATELY AS SOME RAJAH'S DARK EYED DAUGHTER SHE DID NOT FEEL STATELY AT ALL
HER UNCONSCIOUS STATELINESS OF GIRLISH FORM AND THE CONSCIOUS SHYNESS OF HER MANNER WERE THE LOVELIEST INCONSISTENCY IN THE WORLD OH I SHALL NOT TELL SIR DUGALD HE SAID TO HER GOOD HUMOREDLY
LADY THROCKMORTON IS UP STAIRS READING SHE EXPLAINED I WILL GO AND TELL HER YOU ARE HERE THERE WERE NO BELLS IN THE HOUSE AT DOWNPORT AND NO SERVANTS TO ANSWER IF ANY ONE HAD RANG ONE AND VERY NATURALLY THEO FORGOT SHE WAS NOT AT DOWNPORT EXCUSE ME NO
WHAT CONTOUR THERE WAS IN THE TURN OF ARM AND SHOULDER UNDER THE CLOSE FITTING PURPLE CLOTH HE WAS ARTISTICALLY THANKFUL THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER TRIMMING OF THE STRAIGHT BODICE THAN THE LINE OF BUTTONS THAT DESCENDED FROM THE FULL WHITE RUFF OF SWANSDOWN AT HER THROAT
HE WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN MARGUERITE AFTER THIS THEO THOUGHT BUT IT IS VERY MUCH TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER HE COULD HAVE GIVEN A CLEAR ACCOUNT OF WHAT WAS PASSING BEFORE HIS EYES UPON THE STAGE HE DID NOT EVEN GO INTO THE HOUSE WITH THEM WHEN THEY RETURNED
THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER
THAN THAT SHE SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MEN WHO WOULD PERHAPS HAVE THE EXECRABLE TASTE TO SPOIL HER PRETTY CHILDISH WAYS WITH FLATTERY DON'T LET ALL THESE FINE PEOPLE AND FINE SPEECHES TURN YOUR HEAD THEODORA HE WOULD SAY
SABRE STALKED MAJESTICALLY TO HER SIDE AND LAID HIS HEAD UPON HER KNEE THEO STROKED HIM SOFTLY RAISING HER EYES QUITE SERIOUSLY TO MISTER OGLETHORPE'S FACE HE REMINDS ME OF SIR DUGALD HIMSELF SHE SAID
OH SHE SAID AND THOUGH THE LITTLE EXCLAMATION WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN AN INDRAWN BREATH DENIS HEARD IT AND CAME OUT OF HIS CORNER TO TAKE A SEAT AT HER SIDE AND LEAN OVER THE BOX EDGE ALSO WHAT IS IT THEODORA HE ASKED IN A LOW CLEAR VOICE
HE HAD NOTICED THEODORA NORTH THAT FIRST NIGHT HOW COULD A MAN HELP NOTICING HER AND THE SOMETHING BEAUTIFULLY OVER AWED AND BASHFULLY CURIOUS IN HER LOVELY UNCOMMON EYES HAD HALF AMUSED HIM AND YET UNTIL THIS MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER
AND FINDING HIMSELF FACING THEODORA NORTH IN ROSE COLORED SATIN WAS A LITTLE LIKE ELECTRICITY OH IT'S THEODORA IS IT HE SAID SLOWLY WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF THANK YOU THEODORA WHAT FOR ASKED THEO BLUSHING
IN FACT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES EVEN AT SIXTY FIVE AND DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS ONE OF HER CAPRICES AND IN LIKE MANNER THEODORA NORTH BECAME ANOTHER OF THEM FINDING HER TRACTABLE SHE BECAME QUITE FOND OF HER IN HER OWN WAY
FOR THE ROSE COLORED SATIN HE RETURNED COMPLACENTLY IT IS SO VERY BECOMING YOU LOOK LIKE A SULTANA MY DEAR THEODORA THEO LOOKED UP AT HIM FOR A SECOND AND THEN LOOKED DOWN MUCH AS SHE ADMIRED MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE SHE NEVER QUITE COMPREHENDED HIM
WHEN LADY THROCKMORTON JOINED THEM HE WAS NOT IN THE MOST AMIABLE OF MOODS BUT HE MANAGED TO END HIS CONVERSATION WITH THEO UNCONSTRAINEDLY ENOUGH HE EVEN GAINED HER LADYSHIP'S CONSENT TO THEIR PLAN
AT WHOSE FINE LINES AND CLEAR CONTOUR EVEN A CONNOISSEUR COULD NOT HAVE CAVILED
AS TO WHETHER MISS PRISCILLA GOWER WOULD LIKE HER OR NOT SHE WAS AT FIRST EVEN INCLINED TO FEAR THAT SHE WOULD NOT BEING SO VERY HANDSOME AND GRAVE AND WOMANLY BUT TOWARD THE END OF THEIR JOURNEYING TOGETHER SHE FELT MORE HOPEFUL RETICENT AS SHE WAS
THE LITTLE ROUND BLACK PLUMED HAT WAS BECOMING ALSO BUT IN HIS NOW MORE PROSAIC MOOD HE COULD STAND THAT TOO PRETTY AS IT WAS IN AN INNOCENT UNCONSCIOUSLY COQUETTISH WAY THEO WAS NEVER COQUETTISH HERSELF IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE
AND MANY OF THESE RETICENT RARELY EXPRESSED IDEAS WERE REVERENT CHIVALROUS ONES OF WOMEN THE OPPOSING FORCE OF A WHOLE WORLD COULD NEVER HAVE SHAKEN HIS FAITH IN PRISCILLA GOWER OR TOUCHED HIS RESPECT FOR HER BUT THOUGH PERHAPS HE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT SO
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING IN LONDON SO LIKE SIR DUGALD AS SIR DUGALD'S DOG THEODORA STROKED SABRE APOLOGETICALLY BUT COULD SCARCELY FIND COURAGE TO SPEAK SHE HAD STOOD SOMEWHAT IN AWE OF MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE EVEN AT FIRST
HE HAD BEEN SO USED TO PRISCILLA THAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL SO YOUNG AS THIS ONE COULD BE A WOMAN AND AFTER ALL HIS BLINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN THE RESULT OF ANY FRIVOLOUS LACK OF THOUGHT A SHARP EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HIM AS THOROUGHLY A MAN OF THE WORLD AS A MAN MAY BE
YOUR FIGURE IS PERFECT AND YOU HAVE EYES LIKE A SYRIAN INSTEAD OF A COMMONPLACE ENGLISH WOMAN I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A ROSE PINK SATIN DRESS ROSE PINK IS JUST YOUR SHADE AND SOME DAY WHEN WE GO OUT TOGETHER I WILL LEND YOU SOME OF MY DIAMONDS
WITH A CURIOUS MIXTURE OF EXPRESSIONS IN HIS FACE YES HE SAID MISS GOWER OR RATHER MISS PRISCILLA GOWER AS YOU SAY NUMBER TWENTY THREE BROOME STREET AND BROOME STREET IS NOT A FASHIONABLE LOCALITY MY DEAR THEODORA ISN'T IT
I MEANT TO SAY PAMELA MY ELDEST SISTER'S NAME IS PAMELA AND AND AND YOU SAID PRISCILLA BY MISTAKE INTERPOSED OGLETHORPE WITH A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF GRAVITY PRISCILLA IS A LITTLE LIKE PAMELA
BUT DENIS OGLETHORPE DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS PERHAPS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM PERHAPS HE WENT OFTENER TO SEE PRISCILLA AT ANY RATE HE DID NOT CALL AGAIN UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK
THE THICK LUSTROUS FOLDS OF SATIN BILLOWING UPON THE CARPET AROUND HER FEET
SHE SAID SIMPLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DENIS'S INTRODUCTION THE QUIETNESS OF THIS GREETING SPEECH WAS A FAIR SAMPLE OF ALL HER MANNER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE EFFUSIVENESS FROM PRISCILLA GOWER
IT WAS CURIOUSLY PLAIN HOW THEY BOTH APPEARED TO AGREE IN THINKING HER A CHILD AND TREATING HER AS ONE NOT THAT THEO CARED ABOUT THAT
HE WAS NOT OLD MISS ELIZABETH GOWER'S LODGER NOW HE WAS HER NIECE'S HUSBAND IN PERSPECTIVE HE WAS TO MARRY PRISCILLA GOWER IN EIGHT MONTHS THIS WAS WHY THEODORA NORTH IN GLISTENING ROSE PINK SATIN
SHE TOOK HIS ADVICE WHEN IT WAS PROFFERED AND REGARDED HIS WISDOM AS THE WISDOM OF AN ORACLE WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN HE WHAT WAS RIGHT
BUT IT HAD NOT MADE HIM CALLOUS OR INDIFFERENT TO THE BEAUTIES OF LIFE NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE CALLED HIM EMOTIONAL OR PRONE TO ENTHUSIASMS OF A WEAK KIND AND YET HE WAS BY NO MEANS HARD OF HEART HE HAD QUIET FANCIES OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS
BUT STILL IT WAS SINGULAR WHAT A WIDE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE OF SIX YEARS MADE IN THE TWO GIRLS AS LADY THROCKMORTON HAD SAID IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AT TWENTY TWO THEODORA NORTH WOULD OVERFLOW WITH YOUTH AS JOYOUSLY AS SHE DID NOW AT SEVENTEEN
IN A TONE THAT MIGHT EITHER HAVE BEEN JEST OR EARNEST THEY SPOILED ME IN MY INFANCY AND MY UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE CAUSES ME TO WARN YOU BUT WHETHER HE JESTED OR NOT THEO WAS ALWAYS INCLINED TO LISTEN TO HIM WITH SOME DEGREE OF SERIOUS BELIEF
HE HAD NEVER WAVERED IN HIS FAITH FOR A SECOND SINCE THOUGH HE HAD ENCOUNTERED MANY BEAUTIFUL AND WOMANLY WOMEN HE HAD WORKED STEADILY FOR HER SAKE AND SHIELDED HER FROM EVERY CARE THAT IT LAY WITHIN HIS POWER TO LIGHTEN
BUT AS HE STOOD UPON THE DOOR STEP TOUCHING HIS HAT IN A FINAL ADIEU HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEODORA NORTH AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR CASE WITH BILLOWS OF GLISTENING ROSE PINK SATIN LYING ON THE RICH CARPET ABOUT HER FEET AS SHE HALF TURNED TOWARD HIM
IS IT MARGUERITE SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN A LITTLE FRIGHT AT HERSELF SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE HAD EXCLAIMED SHE SCARCELY KNEW HOW BUT WHEN SHE MET HIS UNEMBARRASSED EYES SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE MARGUERITE INDEED A SECOND LATER
HE HAD NEVER FELT VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONCERNING HER TRULY PRISCILLA GOWER AND ENTHUSIASM WERE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH OTHER CHANCE HAD THROWN THEM TOGETHER WHEN BOTH WERE VERY YOUNG AND PROPINQUITY DID THE REST PROPINQUITY IS THE STRONGEST OF AGENTS IN A LOVE AFFAIR
HE SAID THE NEXT MOMENT YES I BELIEVE YOU WOULD THEODORA HE WAS SURE SHE WOULD AFTER THAT SWIFT GLANCE OF HIS AND WELL WHAT A HAPPY MAN HE WOULD BE FOR WHOM THIS TENDER YOUNG MARGUERITE WOULD SUFFER OR BE SACRIFICED
BLACK FRINGED AND LUSTROUS AS THEY WERE STILL WERE SILENT EYES THEY DID NOT SPEAK EVEN TO DENIS OGLETHORPE
THE MOST SANGUINE AND EMPTY HEADED OF MORTALS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOOKED FOR IT IN HER SHE WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY UNENTHUSIASTIC IF SUCH A THING MAY BE
WHY HE ASKED IT WAS VERY PREPOSTEROUS THAT EVEN THOUGH HIS MOOD WAS SO PROSAIC AND PATERNAL A ONE HE WAS ABSURDLY VACANTLY SENSIBLE OF FEELING SOME UNEASINESS AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER UPTURNED FACE FOR PITY'S SAKE
PRISCILLA GOWER WAS A VERY CHARMING YOUNG PERSON SHE TALKED WELL AND WITH MUCH CLEAR CALM SENSE SHE LAUGHED MUSICALLY WHEN SHE LAUGHED AT ALL AND COULD MAKE VERY TELLING CAUSTIC SPEECHES WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED
THEO FANCIED BUT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF HER SHE WAS A TRIFLE AFRAID OF MISS PRISCILLA MISS PRISCILLA WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE READING WHEN THEY ENTERED AND AS SHE ROSE TO GREET THEM HOLDING HER BOOK IN ONE HAND
SHE STOOD ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DOOR IN BROOME STREET HER NICE LITTLE HAND ON DENIS OGLETHORPE'S ARM I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME COME TO SEE YOU AGAIN MISS GOWER PRISCILLA STANDING UPON THE DOOR STEP SMILED DOWN ON HER BLOOMING GIRL'S FACE A SMILE THAT WAS A LITTLE LIKE MOONLIGHT
I HOPE OH I DO HOPE MISS PRISCILLA GOWER WILL LIKE ME HE HAD BEEN LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WHILE SHE SPOKE BUT THIS BROUGHT HIS EYES TO HERS AGAIN AND TO HER FACE BRIGHT APPEALING UPTURNED
BUT I THINK I KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON WE ARE GOING TO SEE DO YOU WAS HIS REPLY THEN SAY IT TO ME LET ME HEAR IT MISS GOWER SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY IN A PRETTY REVERENCE FOR HIM MISS PRISCILLA GOWER HE NODDED SLIGHTLY
SHE WAS NOT WORLD WISE ENOUGH FOR THAT YET BUT SHE WAS QUITE EXHILARATING TO DAY SO GLAD TO BE OUT EVEN IN THE LONDON FOG OF NOVEMBER SO GLAD TO BE TAKEN LION HUNTING SO DELIGHTED WITH THE SHOPS AND THEIR GAY WINDOWS SO READY TO LET HER YOUNG TONGUE
THE HUNTING MEN OF COURSE HAD GONE BEFORE ARABELLA CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GOT UP AT SEVEN TO POUR OUT LORD RUFFORD'S TEA HAD THAT BEEN POSSIBLE BUT AS IT WAS SHE STROLLED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM AT HALF PAST TEN
AND SHE HAD SECURED THE PRESENCE OF LORD RUFFORD AT MISTLETOE FOR SUNDAY WITH SUCH A MAN AS HIS LORDSHIP IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A MOMENT FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION HE WORKED SO HARD AT HIS AMUSEMENTS THAT HE WAS AS BAD A LOVER AS A BARRISTER WHO HAS TO BE IN COURT ALL DAY
AND JOHN EMERSON AND ANITA LOOS WHO ARE AS BRAINY AS PEOPLE DARE TO BE AND STILL REMAIN IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE FILM BUSINESS NO THREE PEOPLE WOULD MORE WELCOME OPPORTUNITIES TO OUTLINE THE IDEALISTIC POSSIBILITIES OF THIS FUTURE ART
SUCH A THING HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT ON ANY OF THOSE ANNUAL VISITS WHICH SHE HAD MADE TO MISTLETOE FOR MORE YEARS THAN SHE NOW LIKED TO THINK OF SHE HAD EVER HAD FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION ALONE WITH HER AUNT
THIS INVITATION ALSO BASED ON THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS BOOK LOOKING BACK UPON THAT EXPERIENCE I AM DELIGHTED TO AFFIRM THAT NOT ONLY THE NEW REPUBLIC CONSTITUENCY BUT THE WORLD OF THE COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY WHERE I MOVED AT THAT TIME
MISTER MORTON WILL BE SO MUCH OBLIGED TO LORD DRUMMOND AND I THOUGHT THAT IF IT WERE SO YOU WOULD BE GLAD THAT HE SHOULD MEET YOU HERE I COULD MANAGE IT VERY WELL AS THE DRUMMONDS ARE HERE AND LORD DRUMMOND WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET HIM
TO MORROW IS SUNDAY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU COULD LIVE A DAY WITHOUT SPORT THE COUNTRY IS SO FULL OF PREJUDICE THAT I AM DRIVEN TO SABBATICAL QUIESCENCE
SHE MUST SCRUPLE AT NOTHING THAT MIGHT BIND HIM SHE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF HER UNCLE AND THAT UNCLE A DUKE
WITH THE DRAMAS SO WELL STIMULATED BY THE GREAT DRAMA DEPARTMENT UNDER PROFESSOR BAKER OF HARVARD AS I LOOK BACK OVER THIS HISTORY I SEE THAT THE PRINTED PAGE HAD COUNTED TOO MUCH AND THE REAL FORCES OF THE VISIBLE ARTS IN AMERICA
WHEN THE EATING AND DRINKING WERE OVER SHE WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS CORNER BY THE NEXT COVERT NOT HEEDING THE OTHER LADIES AND SHE STOOD WITH HIM FOR SOME MINUTES AFTER THE SLAUGHTER HAD BEGUN SHE HAD COME TO FEEL THAT THE TIME WAS SLIPPING BETWEEN HER FINGERS AND THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING EFFECTIVE
WHICH IS THE FLASH OF FIRE FROM THE FILM OR THE HEART OF MAN OR PYGMALION'S IMAGE WHEN IT BECOMES A WOMAN THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN EDITION WAS USED BY VICTOR O FREEBURG AS ONE OF THE TEXT BOOKS IN THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM
BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO ASK FOR IT SHE HAD STRETCHED HER MEANS AND HER CREDIT TO THE UTMOST IN REGARD TO HER WARDROBE AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO WELL EQUIPPED SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS OF HER CAREER
ARABELLA KNEW THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HUNTED ELSEWHERE THAT THE COTTESMORE WOULD BE OUT IN THEIR OWN COUNTY WITHIN TWELVE MILES OF THEM AND THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF THAT RIDE WOULD BE VERY MUCH LESS THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO SEND A CARRIAGE THAT DISTANCE
AND A WELL KNOWN AMERICAN PAINTER WAS TALKING TO ME OF A MIDNIGHT SCOLDING CHARLIE CHAPLIN GAVE TO SOME LOS ANGELES PRODUCER IN A LITTLE RESTAURANT PREACHING THE REALLY BEAUTIFUL FILM AND DENOUNCING COMMERCE LIKE A MEMBER OF COXEY'S ILLUSTRIOUS ARMY
SOMETIMES WHISPERING AS THE DUCHESS COULD PERCEIVE VERY WELL UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE FORMER INTIMACY SHE BEGAN GRADUALLY TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS THINGS WHY ARABELLA TREFOIL HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO COME TO MISTLETOE JUST AT THIS TIME
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS A TREFOIL AND HER PRESENCE THEREFORE RAISED NO QUESTION THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM WAS AMONG THE GUESTS THE DUCHESS KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AND VOUCHSAFED TO HER THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE RECOGNITION LADY CHILTERN HAD MET HER BEFORE
BECAUSE I CAN'T VERY WELL TELL YOU WHY BUT I DARE SAY YOU KNOW AND DO YOU THINK I AM DANGEROUS
EVERYTHING WAS THERE IF SHE COULD ONLY GET IT MONEY RANK FASHION AND AN APPETITE FOR PLEASURE AND HE WAS HANDSOME TOO AND GOOD HUMOURED THOUGH THESE QUALITIES TOLD LESS WITH HER THAN THE OTHERS
WERE AT ONCE OBLITERATED FROM THE DUCHESS'S BOSOM ARABELLA WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND A GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE LEFT THE ROOM CURSING THE UNTOWARDNESS OF HER FATE WHICH WOULD LET NOTHING RUN SMOOTH LORD RUFFORD WAS TO COME THAT AT ANY RATE WAS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN
THAT EVENING LORD RUFFORD WAS VERY GOOD NATURED AND MANAGED TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING LADY CHILTERN AND ANOTHER LADY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO GO TO THE MEET
THAT SIR JEFFREY HAD A WIFE AND FAMILY SHE WAS ALL SMILES AND ALL PLEASANTNESS AND SEEMED TO WANT NO OTHER HAPPINESS THAN WHAT THE PRESENT MOMENT GAVE HER NOR DID SHE ONCE MENTION LORD RUFFORD'S NAME ON THE NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HER AUNT SENT FOR HER TO COME UP STAIRS
I SHALL BE PROUD TO RENEW MY ACQUAINTANCE CAN YOU COME TO MORROW OH YES SAID ARABELLA RAPTUROUSLY THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES AND I OUGHT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT THEM I AM GOING WITH THE FITZWILLIAM
HE IS SAID TO BE LIKE ONE OF O HENRY'S MISQUOTATIONS OF THE CLASSICS HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE THAT ARTIST EDGAR POE IF POE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE MILLIONS LAUGH I DO NOT LIKE CHAPLIN'S WORK
SHE WAS MUCH QUIETER THAN HAD BEEN HER WONT WHEN AT MISTLETOE BEFORE AND THOUGH THERE WERE PRESENT TWO OR THREE VERY WELL CIRCUMSTANCED YOUNG MEN SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF THEM SHE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER
THE OLD DRAGON TOOK CARE OF THAT REPLIED ARABELLA
IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWEET MAE MARSH AS THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST BITS OF POETRY EVER PUT INTO SCREEN OR FABLE FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR OFF AND ON I HAD THE HONOR TO BE THE PHOTOPLAY CRITIC OF THE NEW REPUBLIC
AND AS LADY CHILTERN WAS ALWAYS GENEROUS SHE WAS GRACIOUS TO ARABELLA SHE WAS SORRY TO SEE LADY DRUMMOND BECAUSE SHE CONNECTED LADY DRUMMOND WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND FEARED THAT THE CONVERSATION MIGHT BE LED TO PATAGONIA AND ITS NEW MINISTER
A RUSTIC BANQUETING HALL WAS PREPARED AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY NICE TONS OF GAME HAD BEEN KILLED AND TONS MORE WERE TO BE KILLED AFTER LUNCHEON THE DUCHESS WAS NOT THERE AND ARABELLA CONTRIVED SO TO PLACE HERSELF THAT SHE COULD BE WAITED UPON BY LORD RUFFORD OR COULD WAIT UPON HIM
WHY SHE HAD BEHAVED SO UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF BEFORE LORD RUFFORD'S ARRIVAL AND WHY SHE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO HAVE MISTER MORTON INVITED THE DUCHESS WAS IN HER WAY A CLEVER WOMAN AND COULD SEE MANY THINGS SHE COULD SEE THAT THOUGH HER NIECE MIGHT BE VERY ANXIOUS TO MARRY LORD RUFFORD
LORD RUFFORD MIGHT INDULGE HIMSELF IN A CLOSE INTIMACY WITH THE GIRL WITHOUT ANY SUCH INTENTION ON HIS PART AND AS FAR AS THE FAMILY WAS CONCERNED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE MORTON ALLIANCE SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED MORTON NOW
SHE HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR MEETING HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND WITHOUT CAUSING SURPRISE AND HAD GAINED THAT STEP BUT SHOULD SHE SUCCEED AS SHE HOPED
EMPHATICALLY MY BOOK BELONGS IN THE ART INSTITUTES AS A BEGINNING OR IN SUCH RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC BODIES AS THINK ARCHITECTURALLY FROM THERE IT MUST WORK ITS WAY OUT
WHAT YOU MAY CALL UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HASN'T COME YET I FEAR IT'S TWENTY MILES BY ROAD AND THE DUCHESS WOULD SAY SOMETHING AWFUL IF I WERE TO PROPOSE TO TAKE YOU IN A POSTCHAISE BUT THE RAILWAY I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE WORSE WE COULDN'T RIDE BACK YOU KNOW AS WE DID AT RUFFORD
I KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL AS ONE DOES KNOW MEN THAT ONE MEETS ABOUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SETTLE EVERYTHING IF WE HAD MISTER MORTON HERE I COULDN'T MEET HIM AUNT I COULDN'T INDEED
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS I HAVE PASSED MY TIME IN PLAYING CAT'S CRADLE WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY AND IN CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH MY AUNT AND LADY DRUMMOND I HAVEN'T HEARD HUNTING MENTIONED
IF NOT WE MUST PUT A GOOD FACE ON IT AND GO IN ANYTHING WE CAN GET I SHOULDN'T FEAR THE DUCHESS SO MUCH FOR TWELVE MILES AS I SHOULD FOR TWENTY I DON'T MEAN TO LET THE DUCHESS INTERFERE WITH ME SAID ARABELLA IN A WHISPER
SAID THAT HE AND ANOTHER INTENDED TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE UPON THIS LORD RUFFORD TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT ARABELLA MOURNFULLY CANNOT I GO BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE SHE ASKED NOTHING ON EARTH SO JOLLY IF YOUR PASTORS AND MASTERS AND ALL THAT WILL LET YOU
FIRST BEGAN TO APPLY THE BOOK WHEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE ART INSTITUTE CHICAGO THAT IT MAY NOT SEEM TO THE MERELY UNIVERSITY TYPE OF MIND A WORK OF LOST ABSTRACTIONS ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING RECOGNITIONS I EVER RECEIVED
AND I RETIRED FROM THE FIELD A LONG TIME BUT NOW THIS SAME EGGERS IS STARTING IN DENVER AN ART MUSEUM FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS BUT ON THE SAME CONSTRUCTIVE SCALE SO THIS ENTERPRISE IN MY FOND AND FATUOUS FANCY
MISTLETOE IS AN ENORMOUS HOUSE WITH A FRONTAGE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG COMBINING AS IT DOES ALL THE OFFICES COACH HOUSES AND STABLES THERE IS NOTHING IN ENGLAND MORE UGLY OR PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE
ONE DIFFICULTY WAS GETTING THE FILM TO PROVE MY CASE FROM OUT THE COMMERCIAL WHIRL I TALKED AT THESE THREE AND OTHER PLACES BUT HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT CROSSING THE COMMERCIAL BRIDGE
HAVE YOU ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING ACROSS TO HOLCOMBE CROSS TO MORROW DUKE ASKED LORD RUFFORD THE DUKE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW OF ANYTHING ON WHEELS GOING TO HOLCOMBE CROSS THEN A HUNTING MAN WHO HAD HEARD THE QUESTION
THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM HAD SINCE DECLARED THAT SHE ALSO WOULD GO AND THERE WERE TO BE TWO CARRIAGES BUT STILL IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THE DUCHESS THAT ARABELLA INTENDED TO HUNT NOR DID ARABELLA INTEND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW IT TILL THE MORNING CAME THE FRIDAY WAS VERY DULL
AND MADE HERSELF AGREEABLE TO THAT OLD GENTLEMAN IN A REMARKABLE MANNER AFTER DINNER SOMETHING HAVING BEEN SAID OF THE RESPECTABLE OLD GAME CALLED CAT'S CRADLE SHE PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION WITH SIR JEFFREY TILL HER AUNT THOUGHT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN UNAWARE
WAS EVER A GIRL CALLED UPON TO RISK HER ENTIRE FATE UNDER SO MANY DISADVANTAGES WHEN SHE WENT UP TO DRESS FOR DINNER ON THE DAY OF HIS EXPECTED ARRIVAL LORD RUFFORD HAD NOT COME SINCE THE INTERVIEW IN HER AUNT'S ROOM SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIS NAME MENTIONED
WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER THE DUKE'S WORD DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND A PARTY NUMBERING ABOUT THIRTY WALKED AWAY INTO THE DINNER ROOM ARABELLA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETTLED FOUND THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT NEXT HERSELF IF THE MAN WERE TO COME FORTUNE WOULD HAVE FAVOURED HER IN THAT
AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH HER GRACE HAD THOUGHT SAFE WITH REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF THE MINISTER TO PATAGONIA THE DUCHESS THOUGH SHE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE DOWN THE TABLE HAD SEEN THAT HER NIECE AND LORD RUFFORD WERE INTIMATE AND REMEMBERED IMMEDIATELY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID UP STAIRS THEY COULD NOT HAVE TALKED AS THEY WERE THEN TALKING
WITH THE PROSPECT OF DROWNING HERSELF ON THE WAY OUT TO PATAGONIA SHOULD THE CHANCES OF THE GAME GO AGAINST HER SHE FORGOT NOTHING SHE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR MORE THAN ONE DAY'S HUNTING AND YET THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GOING TO RIDE WITH THE HOUNDS THROUGH ALL THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON
A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A LITTLE LATE HE WAS NOT THERE WE WON'T WAIT DUCHESS SAID THE DUKE TO HIS WIFE AT THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE DUKE'S PUNCTUALITY AT DINNER TIME WAS WELL KNOWN AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THEN ASSEMBLED
AND IS THAT TO BE THE END OF JACK AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT EVER SINCE THIS IS THURSDAY NOT A DOUBT ABOUT IT
WHERE IS PELTRY IT'S A COTTESMORE MEET ABOUT FIVE MILES THIS SIDE OF MELTON WE COULD RIDE FROM HERE IT'S RATHER FAR FOR THAT BUT WE COULD TALK OVER THE DUKE TO SEND A CARRIAGE LADIES ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE A MEET AND PERHAPS WE COULD MAKE A PARTY
THE MESSAGE WAS WHISPERED INTO HER EAR BY HER AUNT'S OWN WOMAN AS SHE WAS LISTENING WITH GREAT ATTENTION TO LADY DRUMMOND'S TROUBLES IN REGARD TO HER NURSERY ARRANGEMENTS SHE NODDED HER HEAD
IN EXACTING CONTINUED HOMAGE FROM THE MAN HOMAGE FOR THE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS SOJOURN AT MISTLETOE THIS MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF MANY IN THE HOUSE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO THAT HORRID PATAGONIAN MINISTER
IN HIS CLASSES IN PHOTOPLAY WRITING I WAS INVITED SEVERAL TIMES TO ADDRESS THOSE CLASSES ON MY YEARLY VISITS TO NEW YORK I HAVE ADDRESSED MANY OTHER ACADEMIC CLASSES THE INVITATION BEING BASED ON THIS BOOK NOW I REALIZE
DURING THAT TIME SHE WOULD CURRY FAVOUR WITH HER UNCLE BY ALL HER ARTS AND WOULD IF POSSIBLE RECONCILE HERSELF TO HER AUNT SHE THOUGHT ONCE OF TAKING HER AUNT INTO HER FULL CONFIDENCE AND BALANCED THE MATTER MUCH IN HER MIND
BUT NOTHING WAS SAID AS TO ARABELLA'S HUNTING BECAUSE THE QUESTION WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAISED AS TO HER RETURN TO MISTLETOE IN THE EVENING IT WAS HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE ARABELLA HAD GAINED TWO THINGS SHE WOULD HAVE HER ONE DAY'S HUNTING
WHOSE OWN MARRIAGE HAD BEEN EASILY ARRANGED AND WHOSE TWO DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN PLEASANTLY MARRIED BEFORE THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS OLD
THE DUCHESS SHE KNEW WAS AFRAID OF HER OR RATHER AFRAID OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND WOULD OF COURSE BE PLEASED TO HAVE ALL FEARS SET AT REST BY SUCH AN ALLIANCE BUT HER AUNT WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER SUFFERED HARDSHIPS
I'M AFRAID WE MUST PUT IT OFF TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M THE LEAST BIT IN THE WORLD AFRAID OF THE DUCHESS I AM NOT AT ALL SAID ARABELLA ANGRILY THEN LORD RUFFORD ATE HIS DINNER AND SEEMED TO THINK THAT THAT MATTER WAS SETTLED
I LIKED THIS ROCHESTER IDEA I FELT THAT ONCE IT WAS STARTED THE FILMS WOULD TAKE THEIR PROPER PLACE AND DOMINATE THE PROJECT DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILMS TO BE CLASSED
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY EYES WERE UPON HER BUT SHE KNEW HOW TO SUSTAIN THAT NOBODY WAS PRESENT WHO COULD DARE TO INTERFERE WITH HER
WHEN SHE REACHED MISTLETOE THERE WERE PEOPLE GOING AND COMING EVERY DAY SO THAT AN ARRIVAL WAS NO EVENT SHE WAS KISSED BY HER UNCLE AND WELCOMED WITH CHARACTERISTIC COLDNESS BY HER AUNT THEN ALLOWED TO SETTLE IN AMONG THE OTHER GUESTS
AND I FIND MYSELF NEXT TO YOU SAID LORD RUFFORD AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT
AND FULFIL THE WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLES OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT AT LEAST I HAD CONVERTED ONE ART INSTITUTE DIRECTOR TO THE IDEA THAT AN EX STUDENT OF THE INSTITUTE COULD NOT ONLY WRITE A BOOK ABOUT PAINTING IN MOTION
I HOPE NOT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS FOR MONEY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR OWN AND I AM TOLD THAT HE HAS A VERY NICE PROPERTY IN RUFFORD THERE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF HIS COMING HERE TO MORROW AND PERHAPS HE KNOWS HIM WHO IS THE NEIGHBOUR AUNT
THE FISH AND SOUP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED AND THE DUKE WAS WAKENING HIMSELF TO ELOQUENCE ON THE FIRST ENTREE WHEN LORD RUFFORD ENTERED THE ROOM
IF NOT A CHASTENED PERFORMER
AND SIX IN LONDON IN WHICH HE GAVE DINNERS AND DINED OUT AND REGULARLY TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS MOUTH HE WAS A GREY HAIRED COMELY MAN OF SIXTY WITH A LARGE BODY AND A WONDERFUL APPETITE
THE SCHOOL WAS TO BE LARGELY DEVOTED TO PRODUCING MUSIC FOR THE PHOTOPLAY IN DEFIANCE OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN BUT INCIDENTALLY THERE WERE TO BE MOTION PICTURES MADE TO FIT GOOD MUSIC NEITHER MUSIC NOR FILMS HAVE AS YET SHAKEN THE WORLD
NOW MISTLETOE WAS IN LINCOLNSHIRE NOT VERY FAR FROM PETERBOROUGH NOT VERY FAR FROM STAMFORD NOT VERY FAR FROM OAKHAM A REGULAR HUNTING MAN LIKE LORD RUFFORD KNEW HOW TO COMPASS THE DIFFICULTIES OF DISTANCE IN ALL HUNTING COUNTRIES
NOW SHE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HER OWN HANDS AND HAD DONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE RUINOUS IF NOT SUCCESSFUL
BUT THE PAINTING COULD BE SHOWN IN AN ART MUSEUM AS PROMISE OF GREATER THINGS IN THIS WORLD IT TOOK A DEAL OF WILL AND BREAKING OF PRECEDENT ON THE PART OF ALL CONCERNED TO SHOW THIS FILM THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS
AND NOW SHE WAS TO MEET HIM IN THE HOUSE OF HER GREAT RELATIONS IN A POSITION IN WHICH HER RANK AND HER FASHION WOULD SEEM TO BE EQUAL TO HIS OWN AND SHE WOULD MEET HIM WITH THE REMEMBRANCE FRESH IN HIS MIND AS IN HER OWN OF THOSE PASSAGES OF LOVE AT RUFFORD
CHAPTER ONE THE POINT OF VIEW WHILE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LITERARY REFERENCE IN ALL THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT I REALIZE LOOKING BACK OVER MANY ATTEMPTS TO PARAPHRASE IT FOR VARIOUS AUDIENCES
WAS THE INVITATION TO TALK ON THE FILMS IN FULLERTON HALL CHICAGO ART INSTITUTE THEN THERE CAME INVITATIONS TO SPEAK AT CHICAGO UNIVERSITY AND BEFORE THE FORTNIGHTLY CLUB CHICAGO ALL AROUND NINETEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN
OF COURSE THERE IS A LITTLE DANGER BUT WHO IS GOING TO BE STOPPED BY THAT
FOR THESE IMMEDIATE TIMES THE FILM THAT WOULD CLASS IN OUR CIVILIZATION WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC OR THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY OR THE POEMS OF EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON THAT IS THE PRODUCTION NOT FOR THE TRADE BUT FOR THE SOUL
IN WHICH HER FATHER AND MOTHER HAD THOUGHT THAT HER BEAUTY ASSISTED BY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE WOULD SERVE TO DISPOSE OF HER WITHOUT DELAY A GENEROUS EXPENDITURE MAY BE INCURRED ONCE EVEN BY POOR PEOPLE BUT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MAINTAINED OVER A DOZEN YEARS
ON THIS EVENING IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEN LORD RUFFORD'S TIME WAS SPENT IN ARRANGING THE PARTY FOR THE MEET ON MONDAY WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP TO BED ARABELLA HAD HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY THAN WHAT FORTUNE HAD GIVEN HER AT DINNER AND EVEN THEN SHE HAD BEEN WATCHED
ALMOST AS BAD AS A SAILOR WHO IS ALWAYS GOING ROUND THE WORLD
THAT HER AUNT WANTED HER FOLLOWED THE MAID UP STAIRS MY DEAR SAID HER AUNT WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK MISTER MORTON TO COME HERE WHILE YOU ARE WITH US
I WOULDN'T MIND IF I DIDN'T GO TO BED AT ALL AT ANY RATE IT WOULDN'T SUIT THE DUCHESS I HAD MEANT TO GO AWAY ON SUNDAY I HATE BEING ANYWHERE ON SUNDAY EXCEPT IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE BUT IF I THOUGHT THE DUKE WOULD KEEP ME TILL TUESDAY MORNING WE MIGHT MANAGE PELTRY ON MONDAY
FREEBURG HAS AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC AND SOME OF THE HAPPIEST PASSAGES IN HIS WORK RELATE THE PHOTOPLAY TO THE MUSICAL THEORY OF THE WORLD AS MY BOOK RELATES IT TO THE GENERAL ART MUSEUM POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORLD
AND SPENT AS MUCH OF THE DAY AS SHE COULD IN HER BEDROOM SHE DID NOT SEE LORD RUFFORD BEFORE DINNER AND AT DINNER SAT BETWEEN SIR JEFFREY AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OUT OF STAMFORD WHO DINED AT MISTLETOE THAT EVENING WE'VE HAD NO SUCH LUCK TO NIGHT LORD RUFFORD SAID TO HER IN THE DRAWING ROOM
ANITA LOOS THAT GOOD CRUSADER CAME OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH THE FLAMING ANNOUNCEMENT
WERE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO TAKE THE FILMS WITH SERIOUSNESS BUT WHEN I WAS THROUGH WITH ALL THESE DASHES INTO THE FIELD AND WENT BACK TO RECITING VERSES AGAIN NO ONE HAD GIVEN ME ANY LIGHT AS TO WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DISINTERESTED NON COMMERCIAL FILM
AND I HAVE HEARD RUMORS FROM ALL SIDES THAT CHARLIE CHAPLIN HAS A SOUL HE IS THE COMEDIAN MOST OFTEN PROCLAIMED AN ARTIST BY THE FASTIDIOUS AND MOST OFTEN FORGIVEN FOR HIS SLAPSTICK HE IS PRAISED FOR A KIND OF O HENRY DOUBLE MEANING TO HIS ANTICS
AND A POSTCHAISE COULD MEET HIM HERE OR THERE BUT WHEN A LADY IS ADDED THE DIFFICULTY IS OFTEN INCREASED FIVEFOLD IS IT VERY FAR ASKED ARABELLA IT IS A LITTLE FAR I WONDER WHO ARE GOING FROM HERE
THE GIRL WAS HIS NIECE AND THE DUKE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE KIND TO THE FAMILY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HAD BECOME OBJECTIONABLE TO HIM BUT AS TO THE GIRL IF SHE WANTED A HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO HE THOUGHT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER
ASKED ARABELLA INNOCENTLY LORD RUFFORD HE IS COMING TO SHOOT I WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE PROPERTY
NOR ANY PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HIRED HORSES TRAVEL SO SLOWLY I BEG THE DUKE'S PARDON BUT I SUFFER THE LESS BECAUSE I KNOW HIS GRACE NEVER WAITS FOR ANYBODY CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE DUKE HAVING SOME REGARD FOR MY FRIENDS DINNERS
I FIND THE EYES OF ALL OTHERS WANDERING WHEN I MAKE TALKS UPON THE PLASTIC ARTIST'S POINT OF VIEW THIS BOOK TRIES TO FIND THAT FOURTH DIMENSION OF ARCHITECTURE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE WHICH IS THE HUMAN SOUL IN ACTION THAT ARROW WITH WINGS
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVEN SEEM TO FORGET THEM THE MOST THAT SHE COULD EXPECT WOULD BE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS COMPANY AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST BE UPON HER METTLE SHE MUST DO MORE NOW
THAN SHE HAD PROBABLY EVER PAID TO ANY MATTER UP TO THAT TIME
AT ALL POINTS LORD MISTLETOE WHO HAD A LARGE FAMILY OF HIS OWN LIVED TWENTY MILES OFF SO THAT THE FATHER AND SON COULD MEET PLEASANTLY WITHOUT FEAR OF QUARRELLING DURING THE FIRST EVENING ARABELLA DID CONTRIVE TO MAKE HERSELF VERY AGREEABLE
BUT PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE LAWYERS THINK THAT HE IS NOT BEHAVING WELL ABOUT MONEY
UP TO THE PRESENT SHE HAD DOUBTED KNOWING THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEN WILL CHANGE THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AT THE LEAST CAPRICE BUT THE DUCHESS EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW
HAD NOT BEEN DEFINITELY ENLISTED THEY SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD I WOULD SUGGEST AS THE THREE PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW FIRST ON BUILDING ANY ART MUSEUM PHOTOPLAY PROJECT VICTOR FREEBURG WITH HIS LONG EXPERIENCE OF TEACHING THE SUBJECT IN COLUMBIA
TO MORROW WILL BE FRIDAY AND THE DUKE HAS HIS GREAT SHOOTING ON SATURDAY THERE'S NOTHING WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF US ON SATURDAY I SHALL GO WITH THE PYTCHLEY IF I DON'T SHOOT BUT I SHALL HAVE TO GET UP JUST WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BED THAT WOULDN'T SUIT YOU
BUT STILL BY THE TIME THAT SHE WAS CALLED ON TO SPEAK SHE HAD FABRICATED HER STORY THANKS AUNT IT IS SO GOOD OF YOU AND IF EVERYTHING WAS GOING STRAIGHT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING OF COURSE THAT I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH
THE SATURDAY WAS THE DAY OF THE GREAT SHOOTING AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THE LADIES WENT OUT TO LUNCH WITH THE GENTLEMEN BY THE SIDE OF THE WOOD LORD RUFFORD HAD AT LAST CONSENTED TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY WITH LOGS OF TREES A FEW HURDLES AND OTHER FIELD APPLIANCES
WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER MORTON AND NOW SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THESE HORRID QUESTIONS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO WITH HIM AUNT THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CERTAIN JUST AT PRESENT
SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID AT PRESENT AFTER WHAT ARABELLA HAD TOLD HER MISTER MORTON COULD NOT BE ASKED THERE TO MEET HER NIECE BUT ALL THE SLIGHT FEELING OF KINDNESS TO THE GIRL WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE TIDINGS OF SO RESPECTABLE AN ENGAGEMENT
OF COURSE THOSE BODIES TOUCH ON A THOUSAND OTHERS THE WORK IS BEING USED AS ONE BASIS OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE NEW DENVER ART MUSEUM AND I LIKE TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW GEORGE W EGGERS OF DENVER
THAT ITS APPEAL IS TO THOSE WHO SPEND THE BEST PART OF THEIR STUDENT LIFE IN CLASSIFYING AND JUDGING AND PRODUCING WORKS OF SCULPTURE PAINTING AND ARCHITECTURE
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PASTORS AND MASTERS THE DUCHESS SUGGESTED LORD RUFFORD I THOUGHT ALL THAT KIND OF NONSENSE WAS OVER SAID ARABELLA I BELIEVE A GREAT DEAL IS OVER YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS THAT YOUR MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T DO BUT ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
AT LAST WITH THE COOPERATION OF DIRECTOR EGGERS WE STAGED IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF FULLERTON HALL MAE MARSH IN THE WILD GIRL OF THE SIERRAS THE FILM WAS IN BATTERED CONDITION AND WAS TURNED SO FAST I COULD NOT TALK WITH IT SATISFACTORILY
HE COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO THIS BECAUSE THE DUCHESS CALLED HIM AWAY TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT TO LADY CHILTERN ABOUT GOARLY AND THE U R U LADY CHILTERN'S HUSBAND BEING A MASTER OF HOUNDS AND A GREAT AUTHORITY ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO HUNTING NASTY OLD DRAGON
WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THE GOOD INTENTIONS AND THE ENVIABLE LAURELS LET ALL THE ART MUSEUMS INVITE HIM IN
SHE COULD SEE BY HER AUNT'S EYE AND HEAR IN HER VOICE THAT SHE WAS IN PART DETECTED AND THAT SHE WOULD DO HERSELF NO FURTHER SERVICE BY ACTING THE GOOD GIRL AND SHE THEREFORE RESOLUTELY DETERMINED TO LISTEN TO NO MORE TWADDLE SHE READ A FRENCH NOVEL WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
THAT THOSE WHO APPROACH THE THEORY FROM THE GENERAL UNIVERSITY STANDPOINT OR FROM THE HISTORY OF THE DRAMA HAD BEST BEGIN WITH FREEBURG'S BOOK FOR HE IS NOT ONLY LEARNED IN BOTH MATTERS BUT PRESENTS THE SPECIAL ANALOGIES WITH SKILL
BUT NEVER SO MUCH IN EARNEST AS NOW THOSE OTHER MEN HAD PERHAPS BEEN WORTHY WORTHY AS FAR AS HER IDEAS WENT OF WORTH
SHE THOUGHT OF IT ALL AND MADE HER PLANS CAREFULLY AND EVEN PAINFULLY
BUT LORD RUFFORD CARED MORE ABOUT THE CHANCE OF A GOOD RUN THAN HER COMPANY FOR A WHILE SHE WAS SULKY FOR A LITTLE WHILE TILL SHE REMEMBERED HOW ILL SHE COULD AFFORD TO INDULGE IN SUCH A FEELING THEN SHE SAID A DEMURE WORD OR TWO TO THE GENTLEMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER
BY MANY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SUBJECT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST AMATEUR JUDGE OF WINE IN ENGLAND
TO THE DUCHESS CONDEMNATION FROM LADY AUGUSTUS ALMOST AMOUNTED TO PRAISE SHE FELT SURE THAT MISTER MORTON WAS A WORTHY MAN WHO WOULD NOT PROBABLY BEHAVE BADLY AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY AND CERTAINLY HAD NO SUSPICION IN REGARD TO LORD RUFFORD
A WORK WHICH ALL THE VICTORIOUS GOVERNMENTS WITH ALL THEIR HOSTS ARE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH CONSIDER WHAT WAS THE FATE OF SO MANY AND DIVERSE EMPIRES AND PEOPLES THE ROMAN EMPIRE FRANCE GERMANY RUSSIA ENGLAND
NOTHING SHORT OF A DIVINE POWER COULD ACCOMPLISH SO GREAT A WORK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THIS WITH JUSTICE FOR THIS IS THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE A CAUSE WHICH ALL THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD
THAT THERE MUST BE ONE WHO IS IN HEALTH
AND I HAVE NO NEED OF SUCH AN EDUCATOR HE WOULD BE DENYING THAT WHICH IS CLEAR AND EVIDENT AS THOUGH A CHILD SHOULD SAY I HAVE NO NEED OF EDUCATION I WILL ACT ACCORDING TO MY REASON AND INTELLIGENCE AND SO I SHALL ATTAIN THE PERFECTIONS OF EXISTENCE
OR AS THOUGH THE BLIND SHOULD SAY I AM IN NO NEED OF SIGHT BECAUSE MANY OTHER BLIND PEOPLE EXIST WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THEN IT IS PLAIN AND EVIDENT THAT MAN NEEDS AN EDUCATOR
IT FLOWS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF THE SUN IS RADIANCE IT SHINES WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF VAPOR IS TO ASCEND IT ASCENDS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE
AND TO OPPOSE NATURE BECAUSE HE DISCOVERS THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS AND THROUGH THIS HE COMMANDS THE FORCES OF NATURE ALL THE INVENTIONS HE HAS MADE ARE DUE TO HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS FOR EXAMPLE
AT ONE TIME THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE CHALDEANS AND PERSIANS
HE IS IN NO NEED OF ARGUMENTS FOR ITS EXISTENCE BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF THE BOUNTY OF THE SPIRIT IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH EXTERNAL ARGUMENTS
MOREOVER IN THE DAYS OF CHRIST THE MORALS OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND THE CONDITION OF THE ISRAELITES HAD BECOME COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND CORRUPTED AND ISRAEL HAD FALLEN INTO A STATE OF THE UTMOST DEGRADATION MISERY AND BONDAGE
OTHERWISE THE PAINTING WOULD HAVE CREATED ITSELF HOWEVER PERFECT THE PICTURE MAY BE
THEY WERE NOT REAL EDUCATORS THEREFORE IT MUST BE OUR TASK TO PROVE TO THE THOUGHTFUL BY REASONABLE ARGUMENTS THE PROPHETHOOD OF MOSES OF CHRIST AND OF THE OTHER DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS
THIS EDUCATION IS COMMON TO ANIMALS AND MAN HUMAN EDUCATION SIGNIFIES CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS THAT IS TO SAY GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION CHARITABLE WORKS TRADES ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS SCIENCES
PROOFS AND EVIDENCES OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD ONE OF THE PROOFS AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IS THE FACT THAT MAN DID NOT CREATE HIMSELF NAY HIS CREATOR AND DESIGNER IS ANOTHER THAN HIMSELF
BECOMES BESTIAL AND MOREOVER IF LEFT UNDER THE RULE OF NATURE BECOMES LOWER THAN AN ANIMAL
IF HE BE IGNORANT HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS WISE IF HE BE UNJUST HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS JUST IF HE BE EARTHLY HOW CAN HE MAKE OTHERS HEAVENLY NOW WE MUST CONSIDER JUSTLY
AND SO IT WILL CONTINUE FOR EVER AND EVER FINALLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EXILE THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND MOST OF ASIA CAME UNDER THE PROTECTING SHADOW OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
NAY ALL THEIR STANDARDS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN
IF THERE WERE NO EDUCATOR THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH THINGS AS COMFORTS CIVILIZATION
CAN THE CREATION BE PERFECT AND THE CREATOR IMPERFECT CAN A PICTURE BE A MASTERPIECE AND THE PAINTER IMPERFECT IN HIS ART FOR IT IS HIS ART AND HIS CREATION MOREOVER THE PICTURE CANNOT BE LIKE THE PAINTER
HOW CAN ONE SOLITARY PERSON WITHOUT HELP AND WITHOUT SUPPORT LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF SUCH A NOBLE CONSTRUCTION HE MUST DEPEND ON THE HELP OF THE SPIRITUAL AND DIVINE POWER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THIS MISSION
DIVINE EDUCATION IS THAT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT CONSISTS IN ACQUIRING DIVINE PERFECTIONS AND THIS IS TRUE EDUCATION
AND HE MUST POSSESS A SUPERNATURAL POWER SO THAT HE MAY HOLD THE POSITION OF A DIVINE TEACHER IF HE DOES NOT SHOW FORTH SUCH A HOLY POWER HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EDUCATE FOR IF HE BE IMPERFECT HOW CAN HE GIVE A PERFECT EDUCATION
LATER THE PEOPLE OF GREECE ROSE IN OPPOSITION TO HIM ACCUSED HIM OF IMPIETY ARRAIGNED HIM BEFORE THE AREOPAGUS AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH BY POISON NOW HOW COULD A MAN WHO WAS A STAMMERER WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE HOUSE OF PHARAOH
AND SPIRITUAL MATERIAL EDUCATION IS CONCERNED WITH THE PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BODY
SEE WHAT A POWER IT IS THAT ENABLED A MAN WHO WAS A FUGITIVE FROM HIS COUNTRY TO FOUND SUCH A FAMILY TO ESTABLISH SUCH A FAITH AND TO PROMULGATE SUCH TEACHINGS
CHRIST AFTERWARD CHRIST CAME SAYING I AM BORN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THOUGH IT IS NOW EASY FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO BELIEVE THIS ASSERTION
WHO WAS KNOWN AMONG MEN AS A MURDERER WHO THROUGH FEAR HAD FOR A LONG TIME REMAINED IN CONCEALMENT AND WHO HAD BECOME A SHEPHERD ESTABLISH SO GREAT A CAUSE WHEN THE WISEST PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH HAVE NOT DISPLAYED ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THIS INFLUENCE
CONSIDERED FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW MAN IS THE BRANCH NATURE IS THE ROOT THEN CAN THE WILL AND THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE PERFECTIONS WHICH EXIST IN THE BRANCH BE ABSENT IN THE ROOT
AROSE WITH SUCH GREAT POWER THAT HE ABOLISHED A RELIGION THAT HAD LASTED FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AT A TIME WHEN THE SLIGHTEST DEVIATION FROM IT EXPOSED THE OFFENDER TO DANGER OR TO DEATH
IN ESTABLISHING HIS GREAT INSTITUTIONS AND LAWS
THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR WHEN WE CONSIDER EXISTENCE WE SEE THAT THE MINERAL VEGETABLE ANIMAL AND HUMAN WORLDS ARE ALL IN NEED OF AN EDUCATOR IF THE EARTH IS NOT CULTIVATED
THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORDS LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE
HE BROUGHT TO HUMANITY THE GLAD TIDINGS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE AND SPREAD ABROAD TEACHINGS WHICH WERE NOT FOR ISRAEL ALONE BUT WERE FOR THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
THE LEAST CHANGE PRODUCED IN THE FORM OF THE SMALLEST THING PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A CREATOR THEN CAN THIS GREAT UNIVERSE WHICH IS ENDLESS BE SELF CREATED AND COME INTO EXISTENCE FROM THE ACTION OF MATTER AND THE ELEMENTS
MADE THEM CONTENTED BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM EGYPT AND LED THEM TO THE HOLY LAND THIS PEOPLE FROM THE DEPTHS OF DEGRADATION WERE LIFTED UP TO THE HEIGHT OF GLORY THEY WERE CAPTIVE THEY BECAME FREE
AT LAST REDUCED TO THE UTMOST DISTRESS BY THE OPPOSITION OF HIS ENEMIES HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS NATIVE LAND IN REALITY THEY BANISHED HIM IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE CRUSHED AND DESTROYED
THIS IS INDEED A PRODIGY A MAN WHO HAD A STAMMERING TONGUE WHO COULD NOT EVEN CONVERSE CORRECTLY SUCCEEDED IN SUSTAINING THIS GREAT CAUSE
TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES THEY OVERCAME HIM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIREST DISTRESS AT LAST THEY CROWNED HIM WITH THE CROWN OF THORNS AND CRUCIFIED HIM BUT CHRIST WHILE APPARENTLY IN THE DEEPEST MISERY AND AFFLICTION PROCLAIMED
AND EVEN HIS OWN FAMILY BY REJECTING ALL THEIR GODS ALONE AND WITHOUT HELP HE RESISTED A POWERFUL TRIBE A TASK WHICH IS NEITHER SIMPLE NOR EASY IT IS AS IF IN THIS DAY SOMEONE WERE TO GO TO A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
BECAUSE IF THERE WERE NO POWER WEAKNESS COULD NOT BE IMAGINED THEN THE WEAKNESS OF THE CREATURE
MORE NOTABLY BECAUSE THE MAN HE HAD KILLED WAS OF THE RULING NATION THEN HE FLED AND IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT HE WAS RAISED TO THE RANK OF A PROPHET IN SPITE OF HIS EVIL REPUTE HOW WONDERFULLY HE WAS GUIDED BY A SUPERNATURAL POWER
AND THROUGH CULTIVATION FERTILIZATION AND ENGRAFTING THE TREES WHICH HAD BITTER FRUITS YIELD SWEET FRUITS THESE ARE RATIONAL PROOFS IN THIS AGE THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD NEED THE ARGUMENTS OF REASON
BRINGS NATIONS AND RELIGIONS UNDER THE SHADOW OF ONE STANDARD DELIVERS MAN FROM THE WORLD OF IMPERFECTIONS AND VICES AND INSPIRES HIM WITH THE DESIRE AND NEED OF NATURAL AND ACQUIRED PERFECTIONS CERTAINLY
TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE ATTRIBUTES AND THE NAMES OF GOD SHALL BE RESPLENDENT IN THE MIRROR OF THE REALITY OF MAN
WHO IS THE RULER OF THE WORLD OF NATURE WHATEVER HE WISHES HE CAUSES NATURE TO MANIFEST ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH HAS APPEARED IN THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE AND WHICH IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF NATURE IS HUMAN LIFE
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE IT IS THE SAME THE SMALLEST CREATED THING PROVES THAT THERE IS A CREATOR FOR INSTANCE THIS PIECE OF BREAD PROVES THAT IT HAS A MAKER PRAISE BE TO GOD
WE MUST CONSIDER WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF THE EXILE OF BAHA'U'LLAH
WITH ALL THEIR POWERS AND ARMIES CANNOT PROMULGATE AND SPREAD ONE HOLY SOUL CAN PROMOTE WITHOUT HELP OR SUPPORT CAN THIS BE DONE BY HUMAN POWER NO IN THE NAME OF GOD
AND MAY RECEIVE BENEFIT FROM THE SANCTIFYING BREEZE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND MAY ENTER INTO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUPREME CONCOURSE HE MUST SO EDUCATE THE HUMAN REALITY THAT IT MAY BECOME THE CENTER OF THE DIVINE APPEARANCE
SEE WHAT A PERFECT EDUCATOR ABRAHAM WAS
IT HAS NOW BEEN PROVED BY RATIONAL ARGUMENTS THAT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE IS IN THE UTMOST NEED OF AN EDUCATOR
FOR IF THERE WERE NO POWER THERE COULD BE NO WEAKNESS SO FROM THIS WEAKNESS IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THERE IS POWER IN THE WORLD AGAIN IN THE CONTINGENT WORLD THERE IS POVERTY
IS IN THE GRASP OF THE POWER OF GOD WHO IS THE ETERNAL ALMIGHTY ONE HE HOLDS NATURE WITHIN ACCURATE REGULATIONS AND LAWS AND RULES OVER IT
THESE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE
FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OCCUR
YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ORGANIZATION
BECAUSE IGNORANCE IS FOUND FOR IF THERE WERE NO KNOWLEDGE NEITHER WOULD THERE BE IGNORANCE IGNORANCE IS THE NONEXISTENCE OF KNOWLEDGE AND IF THERE WERE NO EXISTENCE NONEXISTENCE COULD NOT BE REALIZED
SYRIANS EGYPTIANS PHOENICIANS ISRAELITES AND OTHER PEOPLES OF EUROPE
THEY WERE THE MOST IGNORANT OF PEOPLES THEY BECAME THE MOST WISE AS THE RESULT OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT MOSES GAVE THEM THEY ATTAINED A POSITION WHICH ENTITLED THEM TO HONOR AMONG ALL NATIONS AND THEIR FAME SPREAD TO ALL LANDS TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED
NATURE IS GOVERNED BY ONE UNIVERSAL LAW NATURE IS THAT CONDITION THAT REALITY WHICH IN APPEARANCE CONSISTS IN LIFE AND DEATH OR IN OTHER WORDS IN THE COMPOSITION AND DECOMPOSITION OF ALL THINGS
AND FROM THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES CONCLUSIONS AS TO INTELLECTUAL THINGS MAY BE DEDUCED HE MUST ALSO IMPART SPIRITUAL EDUCATION SO THAT INTELLIGENCE AND COMPREHENSION MAY PENETRATE THE METAPHYSICAL WORLD
WE MUST BE JUST WAS THIS MAN AN EDUCATOR OR NOT
THE SAME IS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO ANIMALS NOTICE THAT WHEN THE ANIMAL IS TRAINED IT BECOMES DOMESTIC AND ALSO THAT MAN
IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN ASSISTED BY AN OMNIPOTENT POWER CONSIDER ALSO WHAT TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES ARISE FOR PEOPLE TO PREVENT AN ACT OF CRUELTY MOSES STRUCK DOWN AN EGYPTIAN
IF THEY REMAIN WITHOUT A CULTIVATOR THEY WILL BE FRUITLESS AND WITHOUT FRUIT THEY ARE USELESS BUT IF THEY RECEIVE THE CARE OF A GARDENER
THAT IS TO SAY HE MUST EDUCATE INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY MAY ATTAIN COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENCE MAY INCREASE AND THE REALITY OF THINGS THE MYSTERIES OF BEINGS AND THE PROPERTIES OF EXISTENCE MAY BE DISCOVERED
THESE GAVE LIFE TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL
THEN NECESSARILY WEALTH EXISTS SINCE POVERTY IS APPARENT IN THE WORLD IN THE CONTINGENT WORLD THERE IS IGNORANCE
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATURE ITSELF YOU SEE THAT IT HAS NO INTELLIGENCE NO WILL FOR INSTANCE THE NATURE OF FIRE IS TO BURN IT BURNS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF WATER IS FLUIDITY
ONE HOLY SOUL GIVES LIFE TO THE WORLD OF HUMANITY CHANGES THE ASPECT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE CAUSES INTELLIGENCE TO PROGRESS VIVIFIES SOULS
CAN YOU SAY THAT ALL THESE ARE THE EFFECT OF NATURE THOUGH NATURE HAS NEITHER INTELLIGENCE NOR PERCEPTION IF NOT IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THIS NATURE WHICH HAS NEITHER PERCEPTION NOR INTELLIGENCE IS IN THE GRASP OF ALMIGHTY GOD
THIS NATURE IS SUBJECTED TO AN ABSOLUTE ORGANIZATION TO DETERMINED LAWS TO A COMPLETE ORDER AND A FINISHED DESIGN FROM WHICH IT WILL NEVER DEPART TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED
IT BECOMES A JUNGLE WHERE USELESS WEEDS GROW BUT IF A CULTIVATOR COMES AND TILLS THE GROUND IT PRODUCES CROPS WHICH NOURISH LIVING CREATURES IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE SOIL NEEDS THE CULTIVATION OF THE FARMER CONSIDER THE TREES
THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE CONTINGENT WORLD ARE IN THEMSELVES A PROOF OF THE PERFECTIONS OF GOD FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT MAN YOU SEE THAT HE IS WEAK
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE WHOLE CONTINGENT WORLD IS SUBJECTED TO A LAW AND RULE WHICH IT CAN NEVER DISOBEY EVEN MAN IS FORCED TO SUBMIT TO DEATH TO SLEEP AND TO OTHER CONDITIONS THAT IS TO SAY MAN IN CERTAIN PARTICULARS IS GOVERNED
NOW WE NEED AN EDUCATOR WHO WILL BE AT THE SAME TIME A MATERIAL HUMAN AND SPIRITUAL EDUCATOR AND WHOSE AUTHORITY WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN ALL CONDITIONS SO IF ANYONE SHOULD SAY I POSSESS PERFECT COMPREHENSION AND INTELLIGENCE
IF A MAN BE LEFT ALONE IN A WILDERNESS WHERE HE SEES NONE OF HIS OWN KIND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME A MERE BRUTE IT IS THEN CLEAR THAT AN EDUCATOR IS NEEDED BUT EDUCATION IS OF THREE KINDS MATERIAL HUMAN
THAT AMONG SURROUNDING NATIONS IF ONE WISHED TO PRAISE A MAN ONE SAID SURELY HE IS AN ISRAELITE
HE INVENTED THE TELEGRAPH WHICH IS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EAST AND THE WEST IT IS EVIDENT THEN THAT MAN RULES OVER NATURE NOW WHEN YOU BEHOLD IN EXISTENCE SUCH ORGANIZATIONS ARRANGEMENTS AND LAWS
EACH ONE OF THEM HAVING SPECIALIZED IN ONE BRANCH OF LEARNING ONLY THUS GALEN AND HIPPOCRATES BECAME CELEBRATED IN MEDICINE ARISTOTLE IN LOGIC AND REASONING AND PLATO IN ETHICS AND THEOLOGY HOW IS IT THAT A SHEPHERD COULD ACQUIRE ALL OF THIS KNOWLEDGE
THEN THEY BECAME THE SUBJECTS AND VASSALS OF THE GREEKS
A JACOB APPEARED AMONG HIS POSTERITY AND A JOSEPH WHO BECAME RULER IN EGYPT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EXILE A MOSES AND A BEING LIKE CHRIST WERE MANIFESTED FROM HIS POSTERITY AND HAGAR WAS FOUND FROM WHOM ISHMAEL WAS BORN ONE OF WHOSE DESCENDANTS WAS MUHAMMAD
THUS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS OF ALL THINGS ARE COMPELLED THERE ARE NO VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS EXCEPT THOSE OF ANIMALS AND ABOVE ALL THOSE OF MAN
FROM THE SMALLEST INVISIBLE ATOM UP TO SUCH LARGE BODIES OF THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE AS THE GLOBE OF THE SUN OR THE OTHER GREAT STARS AND LUMINOUS SPHERES WHETHER YOU REGARD THEIR ARRANGEMENT THEIR COMPOSITION THEIR FORM OR THEIR MOVEMENT
IT IS CERTAIN AND INDISPUTABLE THAT THE CREATOR OF MAN IS NOT LIKE MAN BECAUSE A POWERLESS CREATURE CANNOT CREATE ANOTHER BEING THE MAKER THE CREATOR HAS TO POSSESS ALL PERFECTIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CREATE
THIS SUN WILL BE RESPLENDENT THIS LIGHT WILL SHINE MY GRACE WILL SURROUND THE WORLD AND ALL MY ENEMIES WILL BE BROUGHT LOW AND AS HE SAID SO IT WAS FOR ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND HIM
BECAUSE A CHARACTERISTIC OF CONTINGENT BEINGS IS DEPENDENCY AND THIS DEPENDENCY IS AN ESSENTIAL NECESSITY THEREFORE THERE MUST BE AN INDEPENDENT BEING WHOSE INDEPENDENCE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE SAME WAY IT IS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE MAN WHO IS SICK
THIS YOUNG MAN CHRIST BY THE HELP OF A SUPERNATURAL POWER ABROGATED THE ANCIENT MOSAIC LAW REFORMED THE GENERAL MORALS AND ONCE AGAIN LAID THE FOUNDATION OF ETERNAL GLORY FOR THE ISRAELITES MOREOVER
ALL WERE GATHERED TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME TENT THAT IS TO SAY THE APPEARANCE OF CHRIST BROUGHT ABOUT A UNION AMONG THESE DIVERSE NATIONS SOME OF WHOM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY
WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THE BIBLE AND DENY CHRIST OR IN THE PAPAL COURT
THESE PEOPLE BELIEVED NOT IN ONE GOD BUT IN MANY GODS TO WHOM THEY ASCRIBED MIRACLES THEREFORE THEY ALL AROSE AGAINST HIM AND NO ONE SUPPORTED HIM EXCEPT LOT HIS BROTHER'S SON AND ONE OR TWO OTHER PEOPLE OF NO IMPORTANCE
THESE OBVIOUS ARGUMENTS ARE ADDUCED FOR WEAK SOULS BUT IF THE INNER PERCEPTION BE OPEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND CLEAR PROOFS BECOME VISIBLE THUS WHEN MAN FEELS THE INDWELLING SPIRIT
HE WAS WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN PUNISHED HER STRENGTH FORSOOK HER WITH HER RAGE AND SHE SANK UPON A CHAIR SOBBING OH MY GOD I THOUGHT I HATED HIM
ANY ONE APPROACHING THE VESSEL'S MOORINGS WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A BISCAYAN HOOKER THE SUN CONCEALED ALL DAY BY THE MIST HAD JUST SET
ITS SYSTEM OF SAILS COMPLICATED IN STAYS AND VERY PECULIAR ALLOWED OF ITS NAVIGATING TRIMLY IN THE CLOSE BAYS OF ASTURIAS WHICH ARE LITTLE MORE THAN ENCLOSED BASINS AS PASAGES FOR INSTANCE
HER HEART STOOD STILL HER STRENGTH SEEMED GOING FROM HER LIMBS HER LAST HOPE WAS GONE THE ROOM SWAM BEFORE HER FOR A MOMENT AND THE COLONEL STEPPED TOWARDS HER BUT SHE WAVED HIM BACK
THAT HE MUST GAIN TIME THERE WAS DANGER IN LAURA'S TONE THERE WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN HER CALMNESS HER STEADY EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR HIM YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE SHE SAID
TO DISTINGUISH ONE FROM ANOTHER WAS DIFFICULT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER THEY WERE OLD OR YOUNG THE INDISTINCTNESS OF EVENING INTERMIXED AND BLURRED THEM
THEIR THRESHOLDS AND THEIR WINDOWS TEEM WITH FACES FAIR AND FRESH LAUGHING UNDER GARLANDS OF MAIZE A JOYOUS AND PROUD SERENITY SHINES OUT IN THEIR INGENIOUS ARTS IN THEIR TRADES IN THEIR CUSTOMS
A SOILED CAST OFF YOU MIGHT BETTER HAVE KILLED ME THEN THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE HATED YOU LAURA SAID THE COLONEL NERVING HIMSELF BUT STILL PALE AND SPEAKING APPEALINGLY DON'T SAY THAT
THEY OFFER THEMSELVES LESS AS A ROAD THAN AS A FALL THEY SINK RATHER THAN INCLINE THIS ONE PROBABLY SOME RAMIFICATION OF A ROAD ON THE PLAIN ABOVE WAS DISAGREEABLE TO LOOK AT SO VERTICAL WAS IT
AND LIKE ALL VESSELS BORN OF THE INSTINCT OF THE PIRATE AND FISHERMAN IT HAD REMARKABLE SEA QUALITIES IT WAS EQUALLY WELL SUITED TO LANDLOCKED AND TO OPEN WATERS
SHE WAS NOT HIS WIFE EXCEPT BY THE LAW SHE COULD NOT BE EVEN WITH THE LAW SHE COULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND BETWEEN TWO SOULS THAT WERE ONE IT WAS AN INFAMOUS CONDITION IN SOCIETY THAT GEORGE SHOULD BE TIED TO HER
PORTLAND BILL AN OBSTINATE NORTH WIND BLEW WITHOUT CEASING OVER THE MAINLAND OF EUROPE AND YET MORE ROUGHLY OVER ENGLAND DURING ALL THE MONTH OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE
HAVE SUCCEEDED THE MEASURED STROKES OF MEN THESE MEASURED STROKES HAVE WORKED AWAY THE CREEK WHERE THE BISCAY HOOKER WAS MOORED TO FIND ANY VESTIGE OF THE LITTLE ANCHORAGE NOW DESTROYED
STORKS IN THE BELFRIES LET US RETURN TO PORTLAND THAT RUGGED MOUNTAIN IN THE SEA THE PENINSULA OF PORTLAND LOOKED AT GEOMETRICALLY
NOT A HOUSE NOT A SHIP THE COAST IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT INHABITED AND THE ROADS AT THAT SEASON WERE NOT SAFE WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE WEATHER
AND COMPENSATED TO SOME EXTENT FOR THE LOSS OF STRENGTH THE COMPASS WAS WELL HOUSED IN A CASE PERFECTLY SQUARE AND WELL BALANCED BY ITS TWO COPPER FRAMES PLACED HORIZONTALLY ONE IN THE OTHER
HOLDING ITSELF BY MAIN STRENGTH FROM SLIDING OFF THE BACK OF THE REARING BRONZE HORSE AND LIFTING ITS HAT IN THE MANNER OF ONE WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THE PLAYING OF THAT MARTIAL AIR SEE THE CONQUERING HERO COMES GAD SAID THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF
PRESENTS THE APPEARANCE OF A BIRD'S HEAD OF WHICH THE BILL IS TURNED TOWARDS THE OCEAN THE BACK OF THE HEAD TOWARDS WEYMOUTH THE ISTHMUS IS ITS NECK PORTLAND
BUT WHAT COULD I DO I WAS MARRIED AND AND YOUR WIFE STILL LIVES ASKED LAURA BENDING A LITTLE FORWARD IN HER EAGERNESS THE COLONEL NOTICED THE ACTION AND HE ALMOST SAID NO
WHERE WAS HIS COOLNESS WHERE WAS HIS SNEERING IMPERTURBABLE MANNER
LAURA WAS MORE IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD FOR AN INSTANT LONG ENOUGH FOR THE COLONEL TO MAKE THE INWARD OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT WOMAN SHE THEN ADVANCED A STEP COLONEL SELBY IS IT NOT
PARTICULARLY IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE LIBERTY OF THE CLINK IN THE BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK OF PIE POWDER COURT WHICH SIGNIFIES DUSTY FEET COURT
THE BEINGS WHO WERE GOING TO SAIL AWAY IN THE BISCAYAN URCA PRESSED ON THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE ALL THE SAME THEY FORMED A BUSY AND CONFUSED GROUP IN RAPID MOVEMENT ON THE SHORE
VARIEGATED BY SNOWS AND MEADOWS REVEALS TO THEM THE RUGGED SPELL WHICH ORNAMENT POSSESSES IN ITSELF THEY ARE POVERTY STRICKEN AND MAGNIFICENT THEY PUT COATS OF ARMS ON THEIR COTTAGES
PLACED THE VESSEL IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE LAND DARK FIGURES WERE CROSSING AND RECROSSING EACH OTHER ON THIS TOTTERING GANGWAY AND IN THE SHADOW SOME PEOPLE WERE EMBARKING
WITH AN ALMOST JOYFUL HEART AS HE WENT DOWN THE SUNNY SQUARE I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW SHE SAID AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT HE IS MINE NOW DAMN THE WOMAN
AND THE BLACK PAST AND THE TROUBLED PRESENT AND THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE COULD NOT SNATCH THAT FROM HER WHAT DID THEY SAY AS THEY SAT THERE WHAT NOTHINGS DO PEOPLE USUALLY SAY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH CAUSED THAT WINTER TO BE NOTED AS MEMORABLE TO THE POOR ON THE MARGIN OF THE OLD BIBLE IN THE PRESBYTERIAN CHAPEL OF THE NONJURORS IN LONDON
AND IN THOSE OF WHITECHAPEL COURT HELD IN THE VILLAGE OF STEPNEY BY THE BAILIFF OF THE LORD OF THE MANOR THE THAMES WAS FROZEN OVER A THING WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN ONCE IN A CENTURY
WALLED IN ON ALL SIDES BY PRECIPICES HIGHER THAN ITS WIDTH WAS MINUTE BY MINUTE BECOMING MORE OVERSHADOWED BY EVENING
EVEN IF THEY ARE THREE SCORE AND TEN IT WAS ENOUGH FOR LAURA TO HEAR HIS VOICE AND BE NEAR HIM IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE NEAR HER AND AVOID COMMITTING HIMSELF AS MUCH AS HE COULD
BUT SHE SAW ITS JUSTICE NOW IN A DASH OF REVEALING DESIRE IT MUST BE RIGHT GOD WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HER TO LOVE GEORGE SELBY AS SHE DID AND HIM TO LOVE HER IF IT WAS RIGHT FOR SOCIETY TO RAISE UP A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM
SAID THE COLONEL AS HE PICKED HIS WAY DOWN THE STEPS OR HE ADDED AS HIS THOUGHTS TOOK A NEW TURN
HOW COULD THE COLONEL MANAGE TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS WIFE WOULD IT BE LONG COULD HE NOT GO INTO SOME STATE WHERE IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH TIME HE COULD NOT SAY EXACTLY THAT THEY MUST THINK OF
THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL WHICH LINE THE BAY DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN WINDS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MOST LONELY CONVENIENT BY REASON OF ITS VERY DANGER FOR SHIPS IN HIDING A LITTLE VESSEL ALMOST TOUCHING THE CLIFF
TO THOSE WHO COMMIT THEM WHEN ONE HAS BROKEN THE TENTH COMMANDMENT THE OTHERS ARE NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT WAS IT UNNATURAL THEREFORE THAT WHEN GEORGE SELBY DEPARTED LAURA SHOULD WATCH HIM FROM THE WINDOW
AND ALL THE MONTH OF JANUARY SIXTEEN NINETY
THE HOOKER IS AMONG VESSELS WHAT THE WAGTAIL IS AMONG BIRDS ONE OF THE SMALLEST AND ONE OF THE BOLDEST THE WAGTAIL PERCHING ON A REED SCARCELY BENDS IT AND FLYING AWAY CROSSES THE OCEAN
THERE WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT THAT DEEP AND SOMBROUS MELANCHOLY WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED
WHICH HAD BEEN SOMEHOW OMITTED IN HER TRAINING INDEED IN THAT VERY HOUSE HAD SHE NOT HEARD WOMEN PROMINENT BEFORE THE COUNTRY AND BESIEGING CONGRESS UTTER SENTIMENTS THAT FULLY JUSTIFIED THE COURSE SHE WAS MARKING OUT FOR HERSELF
SEA FOLK HELD THEM AT THEIR TRUE VALUE AND ESTEEMED THE MODEL A VERY SORRY ONE THE RIGGING OF THE HOOKER WAS MADE OF HEMP SOMETIMES WITH WIRE INSIDE
AND IN HEAVY WEATHER THE SEA BECOMES VERY ROUGH AND TO PASS IN SAFETY MUCH SKILL AND PRACTICE ARE NECESSARY THESE LITTLE PORTS PORTS MORE IN APPEARANCE THAN FACT ARE OF SMALL ADVANTAGE
IT WAS RIGHT THAT THIS MAN SHOULD BE HERS AND THERE WERE SOME OBSTACLES IN THE WAY THAT WAS ALL
AS HOT ANGER AGAIN COURSED THROUGH HER VEINS AND SAID AND YOU DARE COME WITH HER HERE AND TELL ME OF IT HERE AND MOCK ME WITH IT AND YOU THINK I WILL HAVE IT GEORGE YOU THINK I WILL LET YOU LIVE WITH THAT WOMAN
FULL OF KNOTS AND ANGLES ALMOST PERPENDICULAR AND BETTER ADAPTED FOR GOATS THAN MEN TERMINATED ON THE PLATFORM WHERE THE PLANK WAS PLACED THE PATHWAYS OF CLIFFS ORDINARILY IMPLY A NOT VERY INVITING DECLIVITY
ALL HER RIGGING STANDING OUT IN BLACK ABOVE THE WHITE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND IN FRONT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED THE HOOK IRON LOADED WITH ALL KINDS OF HOOKS AND HARPOONS DESTINED FOR THE GREENLAND SHARK THE DOGFISH
IT WAS LESS COLD IN THE CREEK THAN OUT AT SEA THANKS TO THE SCREEN OF ROCK RISING OVER THE NORTH OF THE BASIN WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER PREVENT THE PEOPLE FROM SHIVERING THEY WERE HURRYING
THERE WERE MANY OTHERS IN WASHINGTON ON THE SAME ERRAND SOME OF THEM WITH CLAIMS AS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AS HIS A CONCERT OF ACTION WAS NECESSARY
AND THE SPINOUS SHARK AS WELL AS THE NETS TO PICK UP THE SUNFISH EXCEPT A FEW OTHER CRAFT ALL SWEPT INTO THE SAME CORNER THE EYE MET NOTHING LIVING ON THE VAST HORIZON OF PORTLAND
HE WHO HAS SEEN THE BASQUE COUNTRY WISHES TO SEE IT AGAIN IT IS
AND IS AT THE MOMENT RECOGNIZED AS FLEETING AND PERILOUS AND INDULGED TREMBLINGLY SHE LOVED SHE WAS LOVED THAT IS HAPPINESS CERTAINLY
ENOUGH FOR HIM WAS THE PRESENT ALSO HAD THERE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SOME WAY OUT OF SUCH SCRAPES AND YET LAURA COULD NOT BE QUITE CONTENT WITHOUT PRYING INTO TOMORROW
BUT THEY'D HAVE TO TIE HIM ON LAURA WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE HEARD THE BELL SHE HEARD THE STEPS IN THE HALL AND THE EMPHATIC THUD OF THE SUPPORTING CANE
THESE BISCAY HOOKERS EVEN TO THE POOREST WERE GILT AND PAINTED TATTOOING IS PART OF THE GENIUS OF THOSE CHARMING PEOPLE SAVAGES TO SOME DEGREE THE SUBLIME COLOURING OF THEIR MOUNTAINS
CHAPTER THIRTY NINE COLONEL SELBY HAD JUST COME TO WASHINGTON AND TAKEN LODGINGS IN GEORGETOWN HIS BUSINESS WAS TO GET PAY FOR SOME COTTON THAT WAS DESTROYED DURING THE WAR
CERTAIN INDENTATIONS IN THEIR CLOTHES WERE VISIBLE AND SHOWED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE CLASS CALLED IN ENGLAND THE RAGGED THE TWISTING OF THE PATHWAY COULD BE DISTINGUISHED VAGUELY IN THE RELIEF OF THE CLIFF
THIS KIND OF HOOKER WHICH HAS DONE SERVICE EVEN IN THE NAVY WAS STOUTLY BUILT IN ITS HULL A BOAT IN SIZE A SHIP IN STRENGTH IT FIGURED IN THE ARMADA
CARVED AND HUNG WITH RIBBONS A COBBLER HAS A BAS RELIEF ON HIS DOOR IT IS ONLY SAINT CRISPIN AND AN OLD SHOE BUT IT IS IN STONE THEY TRIM THEIR LEATHERN JACKETS WITH LACE
THAT THEY MUST TALK OVER AND SO ON DID THIS SEEM LIKE A DAMNABLE PLOT TO LAURA AGAINST THE LIFE MAYBE OF A SISTER A WOMAN LIKE HERSELF PROBABLY NOT
THE COLONEL KNELT BESIDE HER HE TOOK HER HAND AND SHE LET HIM KEEP IT SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO HIS FACE WITH A PITIABLE TENDERNESS AND SAID IN A WEAK VOICE
THE HELM WAS VERY LONG WHICH GIVES THE ADVANTAGE OF A LONG ARM OF LEVERAGE BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF A SMALL ARC OF EFFORT TWO WHEELS IN TWO PULLEYS AT THE END OF THE RUDDER CORRECTED THIS DEFECT
A SIGN OF BAD WEATHER EXPECTED AND DANGER OUT AT SEA THEY WERE ENGAGED IN CASTING ANCHOR THE CHIEF BOAT PLACED IN FRONT AFTER THE OLD MANNER OF NORWEGIAN FLOTILLAS
I HAD AS LIEF BE DEAD AND DONE WITH IT THE COLONEL SPOKE WITH A LOW REMEMBERED VOICE THAT THRILLED THROUGH LAURA HE WAS LOOKING INTO HER EYES AS HE HAD LOOKED IN THOSE OLD DAYS
CLOTHES WHICH WERE NO LONGER MAN'S OR WOMAN'S RAGS HAVE NO SEX A SMALLER SHADOW FLITTING TO AND FRO AMONG THE LARGER ONES INDICATED EITHER A DWARF OR A CHILD
TOWARDS THE POINT BEYOND FOLLY PIER AND DIRDLE PIER BEYOND WAKEHAM EVEN BETWEEN THE PLACE CALLED CHURCH HOPE AND THE PLACE CALLED SOUTHWELL THE CREEK
HOW CAME YOU HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE RID OF ME NOT SO LONG AS YOU LIVE COLONEL SELBY NOT SO LONG AS YOU LIVE
THESE POLAR BOATS HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM DANISH INTO ENGLISH WATERS BY THE WHIMS OF THE SEA NORTHERLY WINDS PLAY THESE TRICKS ON FISHERMEN THEY HAD JUST TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ANCHORAGE OF PORTLAND
THE SAME WHO WAS IN HIS QUALITY OF APOTHECARY TO KING JAMES HONOURED BY THE CITY OF LONDON WITH A BUST AND A PEDESTAL ONE EVENING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF ONE OF THE MOST BITTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JANUARY SIXTEEN NINETY
WITH NO WIND FROM THE SEA THE WATER OF THE CREEK WAS CALM THIS WAS ESPECIALLY IN WINTER A LUCKY EXCEPTION ALMOST ALL THE PORTLAND CREEKS HAVE SAND BARS
IT WAS A HANDSOME MANSION ON THE SQUARE OPPOSITE THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE THE OWNER MUST BE A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH THE COLONEL THOUGHT PERHAPS WHO KNOWS SAID HE WITH A SMILE
IS FULL OF IDYLLS BISCAY IS
SHE HAD EVEN HEARD WOMEN LECTURERS SAY THAT MARRIAGE SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE SO LONG AS IT PLEASED EITHER PARTY TO IT FOR A YEAR OR A MONTH OR A DAY SHE HAD NOT GIVEN MUCH HEED TO THIS
THEY DO NOT MEND THEIR RAGS BUT THEY EMBROIDER THEM VIVACITY PROFOUND AND SUPERB THE BASQUES ARE LIKE THE GREEKS CHILDREN OF THE SUN
WAS NOT HER LOVE FOR GEORGE SELBY DEEPER THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN'S COULD BE HAD SHE NOT A RIGHT TO HIM DID HE NOT BELONG TO HER BY VIRTUE OF HER OVERMASTERING PASSION HIS WIFE
FONTARABIA WITH STORMS WITH CLOUDS WITH SPRAY FLYING OVER THE CAPES WITH THE RAGES OF THE WAVES AND THE WINDS WITH TERROR WITH UPROAR MINGLE BOAT WOMEN CROWNED WITH ROSES
GREATLY TO THE SACRIFICE OF ITS WILDNESS EXISTS NOW BUT FOR TRADE THE COASTS OF PORTLAND WERE DISCOVERED BY QUARRYMEN AND PLASTERERS TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SINCE THAT PERIOD
THE COLONEL STAGGERED BACK CAUGHT HIMSELF BY A CHAIR AND TURNED TOWARDS HER A LOOK OF TERROR LAURA MY GOD YES YOUR WIFE OH NO IT CAN'T BE
IF HE HAD ONLY BEEN FOREWARNED
LAURA STOP THINK SUPPOSE I LOVED YOU YET SUPPOSE I HATED MY FATE WHAT CAN I DO I AM BROKEN BY THE WAR I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING ALMOST
REPROACH ME I DESERVE IT I WAS A SCOUNDREL I WAS EVERYTHING MONSTROUS BUT YOUR BEAUTY MADE ME CRAZY YOU ARE RIGHT I WAS A BRUTE IN LEAVING YOU AS I DID
THEY WERE SKETCHES IN THE NIGHT THERE WERE EIGHT OF THEM AND THERE WERE SEEMINGLY AMONG THEM ONE OR TWO WOMEN HARD TO RECOGNIZE UNDER THE RAGS AND TATTERS IN WHICH THE GROUP WAS ATTIRED
LAURA IN HER PASSION WAS HURRIED ON TO SAY NO MAN HAD EVER ACCUSED COLONEL SELBY OF COWARDICE BUT HE WAS A COWARD BEFORE THIS WOMAN MAY BE HE WAS NOT THE MAN HE ONCE WAS
TO DAY AS A QUARRY THE PICK BITES MEANLY THE WAVE GRANDLY HENCE A DIMINUTION OF BEAUTY TO THE MAGNIFICENT RAVAGES OF THE OCEAN
AND I WAS SO YOUNG SO IGNORANT AND LOVED YOU SO
WHAT IS CALLED ROMAN CEMENT HAS BEEN MADE OF THE PORTLAND STONE A USEFUL INDUSTRY ENRICHING THE DISTRICT AND DISFIGURING THE BAY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THESE COASTS WERE EATEN AWAY AS A CLIFF
MUST HAVE COME BY THIS PATH EXCEPTING THE MOVEMENT OF EMBARKATION WHICH WAS BEING MADE IN THE CREEK A MOVEMENT VISIBLY SCARED AND UNEASY ALL AROUND WAS SOLITUDE NO STEP NO NOISE
NO BREATH WAS HEARD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROADS AT THE ENTRANCE OF RINGSTEAD BAY YOU COULD JUST PERCEIVE A FLOTILLA OF SHARK FISHING BOATS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY OUT OF THEIR RECKONING
IN THE DRESS OF THEIR MAIDENS IN THEIR SONGS THE MOUNTAIN THAT COLOSSAL RUIN IS ALL AGLOW IN BISCAY
THANKS TO THE LASTING QUALITIES OF THE OLD MONARCHICAL PARCHMENT EMPLOYED IN OFFICIAL REGISTERS LONG LISTS OF POOR PERSONS FOUND DEAD OF FAMINE AND COLD ARE STILL LEGIBLE IN MANY LOCAL REPOSITORIES
A GIRL WHO LETS HER STAY LACE HANG DOWN TRAILING OVER THE BACK OF AN ARMCHAIR DESCRIBES WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT MOST OF THE PATHS OF CLIFFS AND MOUNTAINS THE PATHWAY OF THIS CREEK
LAURA THOUGHT THIS BELIEVED IT BECAUSE SHE DESIRED TO BELIEVE IT
HE MAY HAVE GOT SOME OF MY COTTON IN EXCHANGE FOR SALT AND QUININE AFTER THE CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS AS THIS THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND HE WAS LOOKING AT THE REMARKABLE FIGURE OF THE HERO OF NEW ORLEANS
COACHES ROLLED OVER THE FROZEN RIVER AND A FAIR WAS HELD WITH BOOTHS BEAR BAITING AND BULL BAITING AN OX WAS ROASTED WHOLE ON THE ICE THIS THICK ICE LASTED TWO MONTHS
THE COLONEL VOWED AND PROTESTED HE KISSED HER HAND AND HER LIPS HE SWORE HIS FALSE SOUL INTO PERDITION SHE WANTED LOVE THIS WOMAN
THEY HAVE HUGE ASSES WHICH THEY BEDIZEN WITH BELLS AND HUGE OXEN ON WHICH THEY PUT HEAD DRESSES OF FEATHERS THEIR COACHES WHICH YOU CAN HEAR GRINDING THE WHEELS TWO LEAGUES OFF ARE ILLUMINATED
WE ARE WRONG IN SAYING THE NIGHT FALLS WE SHOULD SAY THE NIGHT RISES FOR IT IS FROM THE EARTH THAT OBSCURITY COMES IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF IT WAS STILL DAY AT TOP
THUS THE GREAT GRIFFIN BEARING A CAPTAIN'S FLAG AND COMMANDED BY LOPEZ DE MEDINA MEASURED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD TONS AND CARRIED FORTY GUNS BUT THE MERCHANT AND CONTRABAND HOOKERS WERE VERY FEEBLE SPECIMENS
ON LITTLE BOLTS AS IN CARDAN'S LAMPS THERE WAS SCIENCE AND CUNNING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOOKER BUT IT WAS IGNORANT SCIENCE AND BARBAROUS CUNNING THE HOOKER WAS PRIMITIVE JUST LIKE THE PRAAM AND THE CANOE
IN THE FULLNESS OF RIPE WOMANHOOD A SUPERB CREATURE WITH ALL THE FASCINATION THAT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD HAS FOR SUCH A MAN AS COLONEL SELBY NOTHING OF THIS WAS LOST ON HIM HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO HER
THEY ARE HAZARDOUS TO ENTER FEARFUL TO LEAVE ON THIS EVENING FOR A WONDER THERE WAS NO DANGER THE BISCAY HOOKER IS OF AN ANCIENT MODEL NOW FALLEN INTO DISUSE
IT WAS LIKE A GROWTH OF DARKNESS AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL THE OPENING OF THE CREEK SEAWARD A NARROW PASSAGE TRACED ON THE ALMOST NIGHT BLACK INTERIOR A PALLID RIFT WHERE THE WAVES WERE MOVING
YOU THINK I AM AS POWERLESS AS THAT DAY I FELL DEAD AT YOUR FEET SHE RAGED NOW SHE WAS IN A TEMPEST OF EXCITEMENT AND SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM WITH A THREATENING MIEN SHE WOULD KILL ME IF SHE COULD
THE LIGHTNESS OF THIS RIGGING DID NOT EXCLUDE THE USE OF HEAVY TACKLE
HE BELONGED TO HER HAD HE NOT CONFESSED IT HIMSELF NOT EVEN THE RELIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE OF SENATOR DILWORTHY'S HOUSE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO INSTILL INTO LAURA THAT DEEP CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE
BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE FOLLY OF ATTEMPTING CONCEALMENT YES SHE IS HERE WHAT LITTLE COLOR HAD WANDERED BACK INTO LAURA'S FACE FORSOOK IT AGAIN
THOUGHT THE COLONEL BUT HE THOUGHT AT THE SAME MOMENT HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS HE HAD RECOVERED HIS HEAD NOW SHE WAS LOVELY WHEN HE KNEW HER THEN A SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL NOW SHE WAS DAZZLING
SHE HAD RISEN FROM HER CHAIR AND WAS LEANING AGAINST THE PIANO PRESSING HER LEFT HAND AGAINST THE VIOLENT BEATING OF HER HEART THE DOOR OPENED AND THE COLONEL ENTERED STANDING IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE WINDOW
FROM UNDERNEATH YOU SAW IT GAIN BY ZIGZAG THE HIGHER LAYER OF THE CLIFF WHERE IT PASSED OUT THROUGH DEEP PASSAGES ON TO THE HIGH PLATEAU BY A CUTTING IN THE ROCK AND THE PASSENGERS FOR WHOM THE VESSEL WAS WAITING IN THE CREEK
WHICH WAS PROBABLY INTENDED AS A MEANS HOWEVER UNSCIENTIFIC
AND HE WAS NOT THEREFORE AT ALL SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THE NOTE FROM A LADY ASKING HIM TO CALL AT SENATOR DILWORTHY'S AT A LITTLE AFTER THREE ON WEDNESDAY HE RANG THE BELL OF THE SENATOR'S RESIDENCE
TWO HARVESTS A YEAR VILLAGES RESONANT AND GAY A STATELY POVERTY ALL SUNDAY THE SOUND OF GUITARS DANCING CASTANETS LOVE MAKING HOUSES CLEAN AND BRIGHT
THE REQUIREMENTS OF HER OWN NATURE SHE MAY HAVE HEARD DOUBTLESS SHE HAD SIMILAR THEORIES THAT WERE PREVALENT AT THAT DAY THEORIES OF THE TYRANNY OF MARRIAGE AND OF THE FREEDOM OF MARRIAGE
THEY WERE SEATED NOW SIDE BY SIDE TALKING WITH MORE CALMNESS LAURA WAS HAPPY OR THOUGHT SHE WAS
THE HARD YEAR SIXTEEN NINETY SURPASSED IN SEVERITY EVEN THE FAMOUS WINTERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
SIX TELL WHY CONCENTRATION NATURALLY HELPS A SPEAKER TO CHANGE PITCH TEMPO AND EMPHASIS SEVEN READ THE FOLLOWING SELECTION THROUGH TO GET ITS MEANING AND SPIRIT CLEARLY IN YOUR MIND
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A HARSH SAYING BUT THE MAN WHO CANNOT CONCENTRATE IS EITHER WEAK OF WILL A NERVOUS WRECK OR HAS NEVER LEARNED WHAT WILL POWER IS GOOD FOR YOU MUST CONCENTRATE BY RESOLUTELY WITHDRAWING YOUR ATTENTION FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
AND THE NATURAL GUARDIAN OF ALL BIRDS SO YOU KNOW THAT NATURE CREATED US FREE TO BE SURE WICKED MEN SHOT AND STUFFED US AND SOLD US TO THE MILLINER BUT THE IDEA OF OUR BEING HER PROPERTY IS NONSENSE POPOPO WAS PUZZLED
IF TWAS ONLY SICH A THIN PATCH OF A BOOK AS THAT IN A FEW WEEKS TO MY NO SMALL SURPRISE MISTER SOLOMON RAPID AGAIN PRESENTED HIMSELF AND DRAWING FORTH THE BOOK BEGAN WITH A TRIUMPHANT EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WELL SIR I HAVE DONE THE LATIN
ON POVERTY A PLEA BEING ENTERED THAT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE FOR THE POOR FELLOW ON ONE'S HAVING TAUGHT A COMMON SCHOOL ALL HIS BORN DAYS WHO NOW DESERVED TO RISE A PEG ON POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS OR FANATICAL PARTIZAN QUALIFICATIONS
WHO WAS THE MILLINER NO ONE WILL BUY MY HATS PARTLY TRIMMED FOR THE FASHION IS TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEM AND IF I CANNOT SELL MY GOODS I SHALL BE UTTERLY RUINED THEN SHE RENEWED HER SOBBING AND THE KNOOK STOLE AWAY FEELING A LITTLE ASHAMED TO REALIZED
SELECTING THE FACULTY BY BAYNARD RUST HALL OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES IT WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PROCURE AS THE ORDINANCE CALLED IT TEACHERS FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STATE COLLEGE AT WOODVILLE THAT BUSINESS BY THE BOARD
SUCH AS LOOKING FIXEDLY AT A BLANK SPOT IN THE CEILING OR TWISTING A WATCH CHARM FOUR WHAT EFFECT DO SUCH HABITS HAVE ON THE AUDIENCE FIVE WHAT RELATION DOES PAUSE BEAR TO CONCENTRATION
BUT POPOPO WAS IN DESPAIR HE COULD NOT WRONG THE BIRDS BY SENDING THEM BACK TO THE MILLINER NOR DID HE WISH THE MILLINER TO SUFFER BY THEIR LOSS SO HE WENT HOME TO THINK WHAT COULD BE DONE AFTER MUCH MEDITATION HE DECIDED TO CONSULT THE KING OF THE KNOOKS
WHEN SHE SAW HOW DAINTILY HER HATS WERE NOW TRIMMED SHE CAME IN THE EARLY MORNING ACCOMPANIED BY HER SISTER AND HER FACE WORE A SAD AND RESIGNED EXPRESSION AFTER SWEEPING AND DUSTING THE SHOP AND DRAWING THE BLINDS
IN THE WORSHIP OF THE GOD OF LOVE TRIUMPHANTLY THEY WROTE IN SOLOMON'S PORCH AND IN HIS TEMPLE OUR MEN RODE IN THE BLOOD OF THE SARACENS UP TO THE KNEES OF THEIR HORSES HISTORY IS AN APPALLING TALE OF WAR IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
AND WHEN THEY HAD SOARED AWAY INTO THE NIGHT AIR THE KNOOK CLOSED THE DOOR AND CONTINUED HIS WANDERING THROUGH THE STREETS BY DAWN HE SAW MANY INTERESTING SIGHTS BUT DAY BROKE BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED THE CITY AND HE RESOLVED TO COME THE NEXT EVENING A FEW HOURS EARLIER
NAY SO TRANSCENDENT SEEMED MISTER MERCHATOR'S CLAIMS WHEN HIS SHOW OR SAMPLE MAPS WERE EXHIBITED TO US THAT SOME IN OUR BOARD AND NEARLY EVERYBODY OUT OF IT WERE CONFIDENT HE WOULD DO FOR PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND EVEN PRINCIPAL
BUT OF THE WORLD THE ARMIES AND NAVIES OF THE EARTH WILL CONSTITUTE AN INTERNATIONAL POLICE FORCE TO PRESERVE THE PEACE AND THE DOVE WILL TAKE THE EAGLE'S PLACE OUR DIFFERENCES WILL BE SETTLED BY AN INTERNATIONAL COURT WITH THE POWER TO ENFORCE ITS MANDATES
SELECT FROM ANY SOURCE SEVERAL SENTENCES SUITABLE FOR SPEAKING ALOUD DELIVER THEM FIRST IN THE MANNER CONDEMNED IN THIS CHAPTER AND SECOND WITH DUE REGARD FOR EMPHASIS TOWARD THE CLOSE OF EACH SENTENCE TWO
I ALLOW SCHOOL BOOKS FOR SCHOOLS ARE ALL TOO POWERFUL OBSTRUSE AND HARD LIKE TO BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT EXEMPLIFYING ILLUSTRATIONS YES BUT MISTER JIMMY HOW IS A CHILD'S SPELLING BOOK TO BE MADE ANY PLAINER WHY SIR
WHERE THEY OCCUPIED THE PLACES THE BIRDS HAD VACATED AND LOOKED VERY BECOMING AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE UNWORLDLY KNOOK TO PREVENT THEIR RUNNING ABOUT AND LEAVING THE HATS POPOPO RENDERED THEM MOTIONLESS
IF THE THOUGHT BENEATH YOUR WORDS IS WARM FRESH SPONTANEOUS A PART OF YOUR SELF YOUR UTTERANCE WILL HAVE BREATH AND LIFE WORDS ARE ONLY A RESULT DO NOT TRY TO GET THE RESULT WITHOUT STIMULATING THE CAUSE
WAS MASTER OF A SMALL SCHOOL OF ALL SEXES NEAR WOODVILLE AT THE FIRST HE WAS KINDLY YET HONESTLY TOLD HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS TOO LIMITED AND INACCURATE YET NOTWITHSTANDING THIS AND SOME ALMOST RUDE REPULSES AFTERWARD HE PERSISTED IN HIS APPLICATION AND HIS HOPES
THAT THE POOR WOMAN MIGHT BE HAPPY AGAIN SO HE SEARCHED UNTIL HE CAME UPON A NEARBY CELLAR FULL OF LITTLE GRAY MICE WHO LIVED QUITE UNDISTURBED AND GAINED A LIVELIHOOD BY GNAWING THROUGH THE WALLS INTO NEIGHBORING HOUSES AND STEALING FOOD FROM THE PANTRIES
LITTLE CHILDREN WITH TEARFUL FACES PRESSED AGAINST THE PANE WATCH AND WAIT THEIR MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD THEIR HOME THEIR HAPPINESS IS GONE FATHERLESS CHILDREN BROKEN HEARTED WOMEN SICK DISABLED AND DEAD MEN
WHICH WERE CARELESSLY TOSSED ASIDE AS USELESS AND THEY FLEW TO THE FIELDS AND FORESTS WITH SONGS OF THANKS TO THE GOOD KNOOK WHO HAD RESCUED THEM SOMETIMES A HUNTER FIRES HIS GUN AT A BIRD AND THEN WONDERS WHY HE DID NOT HIT IT
POOR DEARS SAID THE KIND HEARTED KNOOK YOU LONG TO BE IN THE FIELDS AND FORESTS AGAIN THEN HE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR FOR THEM AND CRIED OFF WITH YOU FLY AWAY MY BEAUTIES AND BE HAPPY AGAIN THE ASTONISHED BIRDS AT ONCE OBEYED
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CANDIDATE HOWEVER WAS MISTER SOLOMON RAPID HE WAS NOW SOMEWHAT ADVANCED INTO THE SHAVING AGE AND WAS READY TO ASSUME OFFICES THE MOST OPPOSITE IN CHARACTER ALTHOUGH JUSTICE COMPELS US TO SAY MISTER RAPID WAS AS FIT FOR ONE THING AS ANOTHER
AND AT THE SAME TIME SET FREE THOUSANDS OF OUR DARLING BIRDS WHO HAVE BEEN SO CRUELLY USED POPOPO THANKED THE WISE KING AND FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE THE OFFICE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE IN THE CITY WAS VISITED BY THE KNOOK AND THEN HE WENT TO OTHER CITIES
ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFIED BY LACE AND RIBBONS ARE WORTHLESS UNLESS YOU ARE PERCHED UPON THEM FASHIONS SAID A BLACK BIRD SOLEMNLY ARE MADE BY MEN WHAT LAW IS THERE AMONG BIRDS OR KNOOKS THAT REQUIRES US TO BE THE SLAVES OF FASHION
PUT INTO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED WORDS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED THREE TELL OF ANY PECULIAR METHODS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED OR HEARD OF BY WHICH SPEAKERS HAVE SOUGHT TO AID THEIR POWERS OF CONCENTRATION
DO YOU ASK HOW TO CONCENTRATE THINK OF THE WORD ITSELF AND OF ITS PHILOLOGICAL BROTHER CONCENTRIC THINK OF HOW A LENS GATHERS AND CONCENTERS THE RAYS OF LIGHT WITHIN A GIVEN CIRCLE IT CENTERS THEM BY A PROCESS OF WITHDRAWAL
HOW MANY ARE THERE MISTER RAPID IT IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BUT IF YOU INSIST I WILL LOAN YOU A LATIN BOOK THAT'S YOUR SORT LET'S HAVE IT THAT'S ALL I WANT FAIR PLAY ACCORDINGLY
IF I LEAVE YOU FREE HE SAID WICKED MEN WILL SHOOT YOU AGAIN AND YOU WILL BE NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE
THIS SATISFIED FOR A TIME HIS DESIRE TO VISIT THE EARTH CITIES BUT SOON THE MONOTONY OF HIS EXISTENCE AGAIN MADE HIM RESTLESS AND GAVE HIM ANOTHER THOUGHT AT NIGHT THE PEOPLE SLEPT AND THE CITIES WOULD BE QUIET HE WOULD VISIT THEM AT NIGHT
IN TIMES OF PEACE PREPARE FOR PEACE THE WAGES OF WAR ARE THE WAGES OF SIN AND THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH EDITORIAL BY D C LESLIE'S WEEKLY
A EXAMPLE YOU SEE FOR INSTANCE I PUT IN THE SPELLING COLUMN C R E A M CREAM AND HERE IN THE EXPLIFICATION COLUMN I PUT THE EXEMPLIFYING ILLUSTRATION UNCTIOUS PART OF MILK
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU ARE PATTING YOUR CHEST UNLESS YOUR POWERS OF COOERDINATION ARE WELL DEVELOPED YOU WILL FIND IT CONFUSING IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE THE BRAIN NEEDS SPECIAL TRAINING BEFORE IT CAN DO TWO OR MORE THINGS EFFICIENTLY AT THE SAME INSTANT
SO ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT A KNOOK WHO MIGHT GAIN ANYTHING HE DESIRED BY A SIMPLE WISH COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAN HAPPY AND CONTENTED BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE WITH POPOPO THE KNOOK WE ARE SPEAKING OF HE HAD LIVED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND HAD ENJOYED ALL THE WONDERS HE COULD THINK OF
DENVER CANNOT FIGHT CHICAGO AND IOWA CANNOT FIGHT OHIO WHY SHOULD GERMANY BE PERMITTED TO FIGHT FRANCE OR BULGARIA FIGHT TURKEY WHEN MANKIND RISES ABOVE CREEDS COLORS AND COUNTRIES WHEN WE ARE CITIZENS NOT OF A NATION
BECAUSE I FIND THE WOMAN CONSIDERS YOU HER PROPERTY AND YOUR LOSS HAS CAUSED HER MUCH UNHAPPINESS ANSWERED POPOPO BUT REMEMBER HOW UNHAPPY WE WERE IN HER GLASS CASE SAID A ROBIN REDBREAST GRAVELY AND AS FOR BEING HER PROPERTY YOU ARE A KNOOK
MAKE THE END OF YOUR SENTENCES JUST AS STRONG AS THE BEGINNING CONCENTRATE WAR THE LAST OF THE SAVAGE INSTINCTS IS WAR THE CAVE MAN'S CLUB MADE LAW AND PROCURED FOOD
THAT AFTER GIVING SEVERAL LOUD SCREAMS THEY FELL UPON THEIR BACKS ON THE FLOOR AND FAINTED AWAY POPOPO WAS A KIND HEARTED KNOOK BUT ON WITNESSING ALL THIS MISERY CAUSED BY HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF THE WAYS OF HUMANS HE STRAIGHTWAY WISHED HIMSELF AT HOME
IT MAY SEEM LIKE SPLITTING A HAIR BETWEEN ITS NORTH AND NORTHWEST CORNER BUT SOME PSYCHOLOGISTS ARGUE THAT NO BRAIN CAN THINK TWO DISTINCT THOUGHTS ABSOLUTELY SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE SIMULTANEOUS
THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE EFFACED ATTENTION OF THIS SORT IS THE PRIME CONDITION OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE MENTAL LABOR DANIEL PUTNAM PSYCHOLOGY TRY TO RUB THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD FORWARD AND BACKWARD
SAID POPOPO STERNLY FOR HE FELT THE BIRDS WERE GETTING THE BEST OF THE ARGUMENT THE POOR MILLINER'S BUSINESS WILL BE RUINED IF I DO NOT RETURN YOU TO HER SHOP IT SEEMS YOU ARE NECESSARY TO TRIM THE HATS PROPERLY IT IS THE FASHION FOR WOMEN TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEIR HEADGEAR SO THE POOR MILLINER'S WARES
READ THE CHAPTER ON WILL POWER CULTIVATE YOUR WILL BY WILLING AND THEN DOING AT ALL COSTS CONCENTRATE AND YOU WILL WIN QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE
THOUGH I HAVE HEERD TELL OF THEM BUT I CAN SOON LARN THEM
TRANSLATE RENDER IT RENDER IT HOW'S THAT FOREHEAD MORE WRINKLED WHY YES RENDER IT INTO ENGLISH GIVE ME THE MEANING OF IT MEANING STARING FULL IN MY FACE HIS EYES LIKE SAUCERS
HAMLET'S UNCLE HE LAMENTS THUS POINTEDLY MY WORDS FLY UP MY THOUGHTS REMAIN BELOW WORDS WITHOUT THOUGHTS NEVER TO HEAVEN GO
REMEMBER THAT THE MIND OF YOUR AUDIENCE FOLLOWS YOURS VERY CLOSELY AND IF YOU WITHDRAW YOUR ATTENTION FROM WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY YOUR AUDIENCE WILL ALSO WITHDRAW THEIRS THEY MAY NOT DO SO CONSCIOUSLY AND DELIBERATELY
IF YOU CONCENTRATE YOUR THOUGHT ON A PAIN WHICH MAY BE AFFLICTING YOU THAT PAIN WILL GROW MORE INTENSE COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS AND THEY WILL MULTIPLY CENTER YOUR THOUGHT ON YOUR STROKES AND YOUR TENNIS PLAY WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE
SO YOU MUST VISIT THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND ENCHANT THE TYPES ENCHANT THE TYPES ECHOED POPOPO IN WONDER JUST SO MAKE THEM READ THAT IT IS NO LONGER THE FASHION TO WEAR BIRDS UPON HATS THAT WILL AFFORD RELIEF TO YOUR POOR MILLINER
BUT OF ALL OUR UNSUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES WE SHALL INTRODUCE BY NAME ONLY TWO MISTER JAMES JIMMY A S S AND MISTER SOLOMON RAPID A TO Z
BY CLEAR EXPLIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS IN ONE COLUMN BY EXEMPLIFYING ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE OTHER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU MISTER JIMMY GIVE ME A SPECIMEN SIR AN EXAMPLE TO BE SURE
ANNOYED AND GRIEVED POPOPO WHO HAD NO IDEA THEY HAD PURPOSELY BEEN PLACED UPON THE HATS BY THE MILLINER SO HE SLID BACK ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE CASE GAVE THE LITTLE CHIRRUPING WHISTLE OF THE KNOOKS THAT ALL BIRDS KNOW WELL AND CALLED COME FRIENDS
BUT WHEN SHE SAW A TINY GRAY MOUSE NESTLING AMONG THE RIBBONS AND LACES SHE GAVE A LOUD SHRIEK AND DROPPING THE HAT SPRANG WITH ONE BOUND TO THE TOP OF THE TABLE THE SISTER KNOWING THE SHRIEK TO BE ONE OF FEAR LEAPED UPON A CHAIR AND EXCLAIMED WHAT IS IT OH WHAT IS IT
THE FINANCIAL LOSS RESULTING FROM DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER'S HOMES IN THE CIVIL WAR WOULD HAVE BUILT FIFTEEN MILLION HOUSES EACH COSTING TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WE PRAY FOR LOVE BUT PREPARE FOR HATE WE PREACH PEACE
PLEASE READ HERE THEN MISTER RAPID AND IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE I POINTED TO THE FIRST LINES OF THE FIRST CHAPTER
DON'T ANTICIPATE DIVIDE YOUR ATTENTION AND YOU DIVIDE YOUR POWER THIS MATTER OF THE EFFECT OF THE INNER MAN UPON THE OUTER NEEDS A FURTHER WORD HERE PARTICULARLY AS TOUCHING CONCENTRATION WHAT DO YOU READ MY LORD
SUCH SPEECHES LOSE NOTHING BY REPETITION FOR THE PERFECTLY PATENT REASON THAT THEY ARISE FROM CONCENTRATED THOUGHT AND FEELING AND NOT A MERE NECESSITY FOR SAYING SOMETHING WHICH USUALLY MEANS ANYTHING AND THAT IN TURN IS TANTAMOUNT TO NOTHING
BUT IF YOU ARE NOW WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH THE DEAD LANGUAGES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU OR ANY OTHER TALENTED MAN TO LEARN THEM UNDER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS PSHOO FOO I'LL BET I LARN ONE IN THREE WEEKS TRY ME SIR
SO AT THE PROPER TIME POPOPO TRANSPORTED HIMSELF IN A JIFFY TO A GREAT CITY WHERE HE BEGAN WANDERING ABOUT THE STREETS EVERYONE WAS IN BED NO WAGONS RATTLED ALONG THE PAVEMENTS NO THRONGS OF BUSY MEN SHOUTED AND HALLOAED
DONE THE LATIN YES
WITH A PARTY OF FRIENDS MISTER JIMMY HURRYING OUT WITH A SLATE IN HIS HAND BEGGED ME TO STOP A MOMENT AND THUS ADDRESSED ME WELL MISTER CARLTON THIS ALGEBRA IS A MOST POWERFUL THING AIN'T IT INDEED IT IS MISTER JIMMY HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING INTO IT
THE ENCHANTED TYPES ONE TIME A KNOOK BECAME TIRED OF HIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE AND LONGED FOR SOMETHING NEW TO DO THE KNOOKS HAVE MORE WONDERFUL POWERS THAN ANY OTHER IMMORTAL FOLK EXCEPT PERHAPS THE FAIRIES AND RYLS
AND BESIDES MISTER SOLOMON RAPID CONTENDED THAT ALL OFFICES FROM PRESIDENT DOWN TO FENCE VIEWER WERE OPEN TO EVERY WHITE AMERICAN CITIZEN AND THAT EVERY REPUBLICAN HAD A BLOOD BOUGHT RIGHT TO SEEK ANY THAT STRUCK HIS FANCY AND IF THE PROFITS WERE LESS
A M OF NEW JERSEY AND HIS ANSWER HAD BEEN AFFIRMATIVE YET FOR POLITICAL REASONS WE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO INVITE COMPETITORS OR MAKE THEM AND WE FOUND AND CREATED A RIGHT SMART SPRINKLE HOPES OF SUCCESS WERE BUILT ON MANY THINGS FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY WILL SURELY CEASE TO GIVE IMPORTANCE TO THE THINGS THAT YOU YOURSELF SLIGHT IT IS FATAL TO EITHER THE ACTOR OR THE SPEAKER TO CROSS HIS BRIDGES TOO SOON OF COURSE ALL THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT IN THE NATURAL PAUSES OF YOUR SPEECH
LOCKS AND BOLTS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO A KNOOK AND HE SAW AS WELL IN DARKNESS AS IN DAYLIGHT AFTER A TIME HE STROLLED INTO THE BUSINESS PORTION OF THE CITY STORES ARE UNKNOWN AMONG THE IMMORTALS WHO HAVE NO NEED OF MONEY OR OF BARTER AND EXCHANGE
AND GOING AT ONCE TO HIS MAJESTY HE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY THE KING FROWNED THIS SHOULD TEACH YOU THE FOLLY OF INTERFERING WITH EARTH PEOPLE HE SAID BUT SINCE YOU HAVE CAUSED ALL THIS TROUBLE IT IS YOUR DUTY TO REMEDY IT
THEIR MORALS WOULD BE MUCH IMPROVED SO HE EXERCISED A CHARM THAT DREW ALL THE MICE FROM THE CELLAR
THAT IS WHAT PRODUCES THE EXPLOSION IN PREPARATION YOU STORE AND CONCENTRATE THOUGHT AND FEELING IN THE PAUSES DURING DELIVERY YOU SWIFTLY LOOK AHEAD AND GATHER YOURSELF FOR EFFECTIVE ATTACK DURING THE MOMENTS OF ACTUAL SPEECH SPEAK
SOMETIMES POPOPO ENCHANTED THE TYPES SO THAT WHOEVER READ THE PRINT WOULD SEE ONLY WHAT THE KNOOK WISHED THEM TO SOMETIMES HE CALLED UPON THE BUSY EDITORS AND BEFUDDLED THEIR BRAINS UNTIL THEY WROTE EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO
THAT NO WOMAN COULD NOW WEAR A BIRD UPON HER HAT AND BE IN STYLE FOR THE NEWEST FASHION REQUIRED ONLY RIBBONS AND LACES POPOPO AFTER THIS FOUND MUCH ENJOYMENT IN VISITING EVERY MILLINERY SHOP HE COULD FIND AND GIVING NEW LIFE TO THE STUFFED BIRDS
FASHIONS OFTEN CHANGE AMONG THE EARTH PEOPLE WHO TIRE QUICKLY OF ANY ONE THING WHEN THEY READ IN THEIR NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES THAT THE STYLE IS SO AND SO THEY NEVER QUESTION THE MATTER BUT AT ONCE OBEY THE MANDATE OF FASHION
I HANDED HIM A COPY OF HISTORIAE SACRAE WITH WHICH HE SOON WENT AWAY SAYING
MORTALS SELDOM KNOW HOW GREATLY THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY FAIRIES KNOOKS AND RYLS WHO OFTEN PUT THOUGHTS INTO THEIR HEADS THAT ONLY THE WISE LITTLE IMMORTALS COULD HAVE CONCEIVED THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN THE POOR MILLINER LOOKED OVER HER NEWSPAPER SHE WAS OVERJOYED TO READ
TOWNS DEMOLISHED AND THE UNTILLED LAND BECAME A WILDERNESS TWO THIRDS OF GERMANY'S PROPERTY WAS DESTROYED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION OF HER CITIZENS WERE KILLED BECAUSE MEN QUARRELLED ABOUT THE WAY TO GLORIFY THE PRINCE OF PEACE MARCHING THROUGH RAIN AND SNOW
OR THE DUTIES MORE ONEROUS THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED THAT A MAN OUGHT TO RESIGN AND TRY ANOTHER NATURALLY THEREFORE MISTER RAPID THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO SIT IN OUR CHAIR OF LANGUAGES OR HAVE SOME EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE COLLEGE AND HENCE HE CALLED FOR THAT PURPOSE ON DOCTOR SYLVAN WHO
BUT AN EMPHATIC WORD NEEDS EMPHATIC EXPRESSION AND THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT IT DOES NOT GET WHEN CONCENTRATION FLAGS BY LEAPING TOO SOON TO THAT WHICH IS NEXT TO BE UTTERED CONCENTRATE ALL YOUR MENTAL ENERGIES ON THE PRESENT SENTENCE
AH INDEED MISTER JIMMY YES INDEED MISTER CARLTON ON WHAT NEW PRINCIPLE DO YOU GO SIR WHY SIR ON THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE AND COMMON SENSE
OUR BIRDS CANNOT BE ENSLAVED THAT IS CERTAIN THEREFORE YOU MUST HAVE THE FASHIONS CHANGED SO IT WILL NO LONGER BE STYLISH FOR WOMEN TO WEAR BIRDS UPON THEIR HATS HOW SHALL I DO THAT ASKED POPOPO EASILY ENOUGH
AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAME AGAIN TO THE CITY AND ON PASSING THE MILLINERY SHOP NOTICED A LIGHT WITHIN ENTERING HE FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM LEANED HER HEAD UPON THE TABLE AND SOBBED BITTERLY WHILE THE OTHER STROVE TO COMFORT HER OF COURSE
DEEMING IT WASTE OF TIME TO PREPARE FOR ANY STATION TILL HE WAS CERTAIN OF OBTAINING IT HE WISELY DEMANDED THE PLACE FIRST AND THEN SET TO WORK TO BECOME QUALIFIED FOR ITS DUTIES BEING I SUSPECT THE VERY MAN OR SOME RELATION OF HIS WHO IS RECORDED AS NOT KNOWING WHETHER HE COULD READ GREEK
AND SERVE TO PASS AWAY MANY WEARISOME HOURS THEREFORE ONE MORNING AFTER A BREAKFAST SO DAINTY THAT YOU COULD SCARCELY IMAGINE IT POPOPO SET OUT FOR THE EARTH AND AT ONCE WAS IN THE MIDST OF A BIG CITY
WAS COMMITTED TO DOCTOR SYLVAN AND ROBERT CARLTON THE MOST LEARNED GENTLEMAN OF THE BODY AND OF THE NEW PURCHASE OUR HONORABLE BOARD WILL BE MORE SPECIALLY INTRODUCED HEREAFTER AT PRESENT WE SHALL BRING FORWARD CERTAIN REJECTED CANDIDATES THAT
YOUR CHANCE WILL NOT BE SO BAD GOOD MORNING SIR BUT OUR MAN OF LETTERS QUIT CYPHERING THE NEW WAY AND RETURNED TO PLAIN FIGURES LONG BEFORE REACHING EQUATIONS AND SO HE COULD NOT BECOME OUR PROFESSOR YET ANXIOUS TO DO US ALL THE GOOD IN HIS POWER
AND HAD SEEN THE WORLD BEYOND THE WOODS AND WATERS TOO AND ANOTHER FUSSY TALKATIVE PRAGMATICAL LITTLE GENTLEMAN RESTED HIS PRETENSIONS ON HIS ABILITY TO DRAW AND PAINT MAPS NOT PROJECTING THEM IN ROUNDABOUT SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES
SO HE GAVE A LOW WHISTLE OF COMMAND THAT WAS HEARD ONLY BY THE MICE INSTANTLY THEY ALL JUMPED FROM THE HATS DASHED OUT THE OPEN DOOR OF THE GLASS CASE AND SCAMPERED AWAY TO THEIR CELLAR BUT THIS ACTION SO FRIGHTENED THE MILLINER AND HER SISTER
THEN READ IT ALOUD CONCENTRATING SOLELY ON THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING DO NOT TROUBLE ABOUT THE SENTENCE OR THOUGHT THAT IS COMING HALF THE TROUBLES OF MANKIND ARISE FROM ANTICIPATING TRIALS THAT NEVER OCCUR AVOID THIS IN SPEAKING
TO FIND HIS OWN CHAIR A VAST SAVING TO THE STATE IF THE SAME CHAIR I SAW IN MISTER WHACKUM'S SCHOOL ROOM FOR HIS CHAIR THERE WAS ONE WITH A HICKORY BOTTOM AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD HAVE FILLED IT AND EVEN LAPPED OVER ITS EDGES WITH EQUAL DIGNITY IN THE RECITATION ROOM OF BIG COLLEGE
WAR ONLY DEFERS A QUESTION NO ISSUE WILL EVER REALLY BE SETTLED UNTIL IT IS SETTLED RIGHTLY LIKE RIVAL GUN GANGS IN A BACK ALLEY THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE BLOODY AGES HAVE FOUGHT OVER THEIR DIFFERENCES
READ IT AS FAST AS ENGLISH YES AS FAST AS ENGLISH AND I DIDN'T FIND IT HARD AT ALL MAY I TRY YOU ON A PAGE TRY AWAY TRY AWAY THAT'S WHAT I'VE COME FOR
MIGHT DECREED RIGHT WARRIORS WERE SAVIOURS IN NAZARETH A CARPENTER LAID DOWN THE SAW AND PREACHED THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN TWELVE CENTURIES AFTERWARDS HIS FOLLOWERS MARCHED TO THE HOLY LAND TO DESTROY ALL WHO DIFFERED WITH THEM
AFTER OUR COLLEGE OPENED HE WAITED ON ME A LEADING TRUSTEE WITH A PROPOSAL TO BOARD OUR STUDENTS AND AUTHORIZED ME TO PUBLISH
WHEN I TRIED BY FIGURES THEY EVERY ONE OF THEM CAME OUT RIGHT AND BRUNG THE ANSWER I MEAN TO CYPHER BY LETTERS ALTOGETHER MISTER JIMMY MY COMPANY IS NEARLY OUT OF SIGHT IF YOU CAN GET ALONG THIS WAY THROUGH SIMPLE AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS BY OUR MEETING
EVEN THE POLICEMEN SLUMBERED SLYLY AND THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO PROWLING THIEVES ABROAD HIS NERVES BEING SOOTHED BY THE STILLNESS POPOPO BEGAN TO ENJOY HIMSELF HE ENTERED MANY OF THE HOUSES AND EXAMINED THEIR ROOMS WITH MUCH CURIOSITY
AND ON PURE PATRIOTIC PRINCIPLES SUCH AS A PERSON'S HAVING BEEN BORN IN A CANEBRAKE AND ROCKED IN A SUGAR TROUGH ON THE OTHER HAND A FAT DULL HEADED AND MODEST ENGLISHMAN ASKED FOR A PLACE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN BORN IN LIVERPOOL
KNOWING THE CANDIDATE'S CHARACTER MALICIOUSLY SENT HIM TO ME ACCORDINGLY THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN PRESENTED HIMSELF AND WITHOUT CEREMONY INSTANTLY MADE KNOWN HIS BUSINESS THUS I HEERD SIR YOU WANTED SOMEBODY TO TEACH THE STATE SCHOOL
DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW HOLLOW A MEMORIZED SPEECH USUALLY SOUNDS YOU HAVE LISTENED TO THE RANTING MECHANICAL CADENCE OF INEFFICIENT ACTORS LAWYERS AND PREACHERS THEIR TROUBLE IS A MENTAL ONE THEY ARE NOT CONCENTRATEDLY THINKING THOUGHTS
IS REALLY VERY RAPID ROTATION FROM THE FIRST THOUGHT TO THE SECOND AND BACK AGAIN JUST AS IN THE ABOVE CITED EXPERIMENT THE ATTENTION MUST SHIFT FROM ONE HAND TO THE OTHER UNTIL ONE OR THE OTHER MOVEMENT BECOMES PARTLY OR WHOLLY AUTOMATIC WHATEVER IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH OF THIS CONTENTION
BUT EQUIP FOR WAR WERE HALF THE POWER THAT FILLS THE WORLD WITH TERROR WERE HALF THE WEALTH BESTOWED ON CAMP AND COURT GIVEN TO REDEEM THIS WORLD FROM ERROR THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF ARSENAL AND FORT
THE CAUTION IS OF QUITE ANOTHER SORT WHILE SPEAKING ONE SENTENCE DO NOT THINK OF THE SENTENCE TO FOLLOW LET IT COME FROM ITS PROPER SOURCE WITHIN YOURSELF YOU CANNOT DELIVER A BROADSIDE WITHOUT CONCENTRATED FORCE
TO CONCENTRATE IS SIMPLY TO ATTEND TO ONE THING AND ATTEND TO NOTHING ELSE IF YOU FIND THAT YOU CANNOT DO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ATTEND TO THAT FIRST REMOVE THE CAUSE AND THE SYMPTOM WILL DISAPPEAR
POPOPO WAS INVISIBLE TO MORTAL EYES SO HE STOOD BY AND LISTENED TO THEIR CONVERSATION CHEER UP SISTER SAID ONE EVEN THOUGH YOUR PRETTY BIRDS HAVE ALL BEEN STOLEN THE HATS THEMSELVES REMAIN ALAS CRIED THE OTHER
YET LIFE HAD BECOME AS TEDIOUS TO HIM NOW AS IT MIGHT BE TO ONE WHO WAS UNABLE TO GRATIFY A SINGLE WISH FINALLY BY CHANCE POPOPO THOUGHT OF THE EARTH PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN CITIES AND SO HE RESOLVED TO VISIT THEM AND SEE HOW THEY LIVED THIS WOULD SURELY BE FINE AMUSEMENT
SLEEPING ON THE GROUND EATING STALE FOOD OR STARVING CONTRACTING DISEASES AND FACING GUNS THAT FIRE SIX HUNDRED TIMES A MINUTE FOR FIFTY CENTS A DAY THIS IS THE SOLDIER'S LIFE AT THE WINDOW SITS THE WIDOWED MOTHER CRYING
THAT SIR AND THEN HE READ THUS IN PRINSPO
CONCENTRATION IN DELIVERY ATTENTION IS THE MICROSCOPE OF THE MENTAL EYE ITS POWER MAY BE HIGH OR LOW ITS FIELD OF VIEW NARROW OR BROAD WHEN HIGH POWER IS USED ATTENTION IS CONFINED WITHIN VERY CIRCUMSCRIBED LIMITS
SO POPOPO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED BY THE NOVEL SIGHT OF SO MANY COLLECTIONS OF GOODS AND MERCHANDISE DURING HIS WANDERINGS HE ENTERED A MILLINERY SHOP AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE WITHIN A LARGE GLASS CASE A GREAT NUMBER OF WOMEN'S HATS
GERMANY FRANCE SWEDEN AND SPAIN WARRED FOR THIRTY YEARS AT MAGDEBURG THIRTY THOUSAND OUT OF THIRTY SIX THOUSAND WERE KILLED REGARDLESS OF SEX OR AGE IN GERMANY SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED FOR A THIRD OF A CENTURY HOMES BURNED WOMEN OUTRAGED
WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH FASHIONS ANYWAY SCREAMED A LINNET IF IT WERE THE FASHION TO WEAR KNOOKS PERCHED UPON WOMEN'S HATS
A MOUSE GASPED THE MILLINER TREMBLING WITH TERROR POPOPO SEEING THIS COMMOTION NOW REALIZED THAT MICE ARE ESPECIALLY DISAGREEABLE TO HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT HE HAD MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE IN PLACING THEM UPON THE HATS
NOW AND THEN THIS PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE APPLIED TO AN EMPHATIC SENTENCE BY STRESSING EACH WORD IT IS A GOOD DEVICE FOR EXCITING SPECIAL ATTENTION AND IT FURNISHES A PLEASING VARIETY
DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IS NOT THE COLOR OF THE HORSE IMPRESSED UPON US MORE EMPHATICALLY WHEN YOU SAY MY HORSE IS NOT BLACK HE IS WHITE THAN IT WOULD BE BY HEARING YOU ASSERT MERELY THAT YOUR HORSE IS WHITE
MY BOY YOU WILL ONE DAY GO BACK TO SANTO DOMINGO FORGET THAT FRANCE MURDERED YOUR FATHER
THAT IS WHAT THE REPUBLIC NEEDS TODAY NEW MEN MEN WHO ARE WISE TOWARD THE SOIL TOWARD THE GRAINS TOWARD THE TOOLS IF GOD WOULD ONLY RAISE UP FOR THE PEOPLE TWO OR THREE MEN LIKE WATT
THE SUN COULD NOT AFFORD TO WASTE THE TIME AND ATTENTION OF ITS READERS ON SUCH UNIMPORTANT HAPPENINGS BUT SAID MISTER DANA IF YOU SEE A MAN BITE A DOG HURRY BACK TO THE OFFICE AND WRITE THE STORY
OF COURSE THAT IS NEWS THAT IS UNUSUAL NOW THE SPEAKER WHO SAYS IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE IS PUTTING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS UPON THINGS THAT ARE OF NO MORE IMPORTANCE TO METROPOLITAN READERS THAN A DOG BITE
IT POINTS VERY PLAINLY TO THE FACT THAT THE REST OF HIS POWERS ARE NOT DEVELOPED MONOTONY REVEALS OUR LIMITATIONS IN ITS EFFECT ON ITS VICTIM MONOTONY IS ACTUALLY DEADLY
WILL NEVER MAKE A LIVE SPEECH OUT OF A DEAD ONE SO LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT PUBLIC SPEAKING IS NOT A MATTER OF MASTERING A FEW DEAD RULES
THEY ARE THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF SUCCESSFUL SPEAKING GET YOUR PRINCIPLES RIGHT SAID NAPOLEON AND THE REST IS A MATTER OF DETAIL IT IS USELESS TO SHOE A DEAD HORSE AND ALL THE SOUND PRINCIPLES IN CHRISTENDOM
THE ITALICIZED PART OF THE FOLLOWING MIGHT ALSO BE DELIVERED WITH THIS EVERY WORD EMPHASIS OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF DELIVERING IT THIS IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL GOOD INTERPRETATIONS THAT MIGHT BE CHOSEN KNOWING THE PRICE WE MUST PAY
EARNESTNESS IT MUST COME FROM WITHIN OUTWARD LAST NIGHT A SPEAKER SAID THE CURSE OF THIS COUNTRY IS NOT A LACK OF EDUCATION IT'S POLITICS HE EMPHASIZED CURSE LACK EDUCATION
DID YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO DESTROY ME AND POISON JACQUELINE'S MIND IF I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF THE THING WITH WHICH YOU CHARGE ME WHAT I HAVE DONE WOULD HAVE BEEN COWARDLY OTHERWISE IT IS JUSTIFIED
TWELVE IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE WOULD YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE AUTHOR'S MARKINGS FOR EMPHASIS WHERE WHY BEAR IN MIND THAT NOT ALL WORDS MARKED REQUIRE THE SAME DEGREE OF EMPHASIS
THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN METHODS THAT YOU MUST CONTINUALLY EMPLOY IN GETTING YOUR EFFECTS LET US NOT CONFOUND LOUDNESS WITH EMPHASIS TO YELL IS NOT A SIGN OF EARNESTNESS INTELLIGENCE OR FEELING
CITE INSTANCES IN MAN'S DAILY LIFE FOUR DESCRIBE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF MONOTONY IN BOTH CASES FIVE READ ALOUD SOME SPEECH WITHOUT PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ITS MEANING OR FORCE
WILL NOT GET RESULTS NOT EVERY WORD IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE THEREFORE ONLY CERTAIN WORDS DEMAND EMPHASIS
WE HAVE LEFT UNDONE THOSE THINGS WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
TREE AND SPEECH QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF MONOTONY TWO CITE SOME INSTANCES IN NATURE THREE
READ THE CHAPTERS ON INFLECTION FEELING PAUSE CHANGE OF PITCH CHANGE OF TEMPO EACH OF THESE WILL EXPLAIN IN DETAIL HOW TO GET EMPHASIS THROUGH THE USE OF A CERTAIN PRINCIPLE
STRONGLY EMPHASIZING A SINGLE WORD HAS A TENDENCY TO SUGGEST ITS ANTITHESIS NOTICE HOW THE MEANING CHANGES BY MERELY PUTTING THE EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT WORDS IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
TAKE THE FOLLOWING FROM ROBERT CHAMBERS NOVEL THE BUSINESS OF LIFE
HIS EMPHASIS WAS BOTH CORRECT AND POWERFUL HE CONCENTRATED ALL OUR ATTENTION ON THE WORDS THAT MEANT SOMETHING INSTEAD OF HOLDING IT UP ON SUCH WORDS AS OF THIS A OF IT'S
INSTEAD OF NEXT SPRING I INTENDED TO BUY A HOUSE THIS SPRING INSTEAD OF IN THE AUTUMN WHEN A GREAT BATTLE IS REPORTED IN THE PAPERS THEY DO NOT KEEP EMPHASIZING THE SAME FACTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
HE MUST HAVE EITHER TRUTH OR ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IF HE WEARIES THEIR ATTENTION WITH TRIFLES THEY WILL HAVE NEITHER VIVACITY NOR DESIRE LEFT WHEN HE REACHES WORDS OF WALL STREET AND SKYSCRAPER IMPORTANCE
BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID THE WORDS THOUGHT AND DID IMMEDIATELY CATCH THE READER'S ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS NOT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGER
SIX NOW REPEAT IT AFTER YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY ASSIMILATED ITS MATTER AND SPIRIT WHAT DIFFERENCE DO YOU NOTICE IN ITS RENDITION SEVEN
IT WILL DRIVE THE BLOOM FROM THE CHEEK AND THE LUSTRE FROM THE EYE AS QUICKLY AS SIN AND OFTEN LEADS TO VICIOUSNESS THE WORST PUNISHMENT THAT HUMAN INGENUITY HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO INVENT IS EXTREME MONOTONY
POLITICS THE OTHER WORDS WERE HURRIED OVER AND THUS GIVEN NO COMPARATIVE IMPORTANCE AT ALL THE WORD POLITICS WAS FLAMED OUT WITH GREAT FEELING AS HE SLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER INDIGNANTLY
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT LAY A MARBLE ON THE TABLE AND DO NOTHING EIGHTEEN HOURS OF THE DAY BUT CHANGE THAT MARBLE FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER AND BACK AGAIN AND YOU WILL GO INSANE IF YOU CONTINUE LONG ENOUGH SO THIS THING THAT SHORTENS LIFE
AND WHEN HE FAILS TO EMPHASIZE CHOICE HE IS LIKE THE REPORTER WHO PASSES UP THE MAN'S BITING A DOG THE IDEAL SPEAKER MAKES HIS BIG WORDS STAND OUT LIKE MOUNTAIN PEAKS HIS UNIMPORTANT WORDS ARE SUBMERGED LIKE STREAM BEDS
AND JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DISREGARD THEM WILL YOUR SPEAKING BE FEEBLE AND INEFFECTIVE WE CANNOT IMPRESS TOO THOROUGHLY UPON YOU THE NECESSITY FOR A REAL WORKING MASTERY OF THESE PRINCIPLES
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY MASS A CHU SETTS EMPHASIZING EVERY SYLLABLE EQUALLY AS TO LAY EQUAL STRESS ON EACH WORD IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCES SPEAK IT ALOUD AND SEE OF COURSE YOU WILL WANT TO EMPHASIZE DESTINY
AND EMPHASIZE ONLY THE WORDS REPRESENTING THE IMPORTANT IDEAS THE AVERAGE SPEAKER WILL DELIVER THE FOREGOING LINE ON DESTINY WITH ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS ON EACH WORD INSTEAD OF SAYING IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE HE WILL DELIVER IT
THE SACRIFICE WE MUST MAKE THE BURDENS WE MUST CARRY THE ASSAULTS WE MUST ENDURE KNOWING FULL WELL THE COST YET WE ENLIST AND WE ENLIST FOR THE WAR FOR WE KNOW THE JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE AND WE KNOW TOO
LACK OF VARIATION THE MONOTONOUS SPEAKER NOT ONLY DRONES ALONG IN THE SAME VOLUME AND PITCH OF TONE BUT USES ALWAYS THE SAME EMPHASIS THE SAME SPEED THE SAME THOUGHTS OR DISPENSES WITH THOUGHT ALTOGETHER
YOU DO NOT DWELL ON THESE SMALL WORDS IN YOUR EVERYDAY CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A CONVERSATIONAL BORE APPLY THE CORRECT METHOD OF EVERYDAY SPEECH TO THE PLATFORM AS WE HAVE NOTED ELSEWHERE
SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE EMPHATIC AND HERE WE SEE THAT CONTRAST IS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST DEVICES TO GAIN EMPHASIS AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER YOU CAN ASSIST THIS EMPHASIS OF CONTRAST WITH YOUR VOICE IF YOU SAY
PATRICK HENRY'S NOTABLE CLIMAX COULD BE DELIVERED IN THAT MANNER VERY EFFECTIVELY GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH
REPRESENT A FEW HOURS OR A FEW WEEKS BUT TWENTY YEARS FOR GROWTH STANDS BETWEEN MAN'S CRADLE AND HIS CITIZENSHIP THIS PROTRACTED CHILDHOOD MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO HAND OVER TO THE BOY
FOR IT IS ONE OF THE TWO BIG IDEAS IN THE STATEMENT ANOTHER REASON WHY CHANCE TAKES EMPHASIS IS THAT IT IS CONTRASTED WITH CHOICE IN THE NEXT SENTENCE OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR HAS CONTRASTED THESE IDEAS PURPOSELY
CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY IMPROVEMENT ELEVEN FROM A NEWSPAPER OR A MAGAZINE CLIP A REPORT OF AN ADDRESS OR A BIOGRAPHICAL EULOGY MARK THE PASSAGE FOR EMPHASIS AND BRING IT WITH YOU TO CLASS
AND JOHN BROWN THE RIPE FRUIT OF OUR NOONDAY THEN DIPPING HER PEN IN THE SUNLIGHT WILL WRITE IN THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE THEM ALL THE NAME OF THE SOLDIER THE STATESMAN THE MARTYR TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE
WITH THE IMPORTANT WORD AS THE ACCENTED SYLLABLE NOTE THE FOLLOWING
MOTTE OUR ENGLISH HAS CHANGED WITH THE YEARS SO THAT MANY WORDS NOW CONNOTE MORE THAN THEY DID ORIGINALLY THIS IS TRUE OF THE WORD MONOTONOUS FROM HAVING BUT ONE TONE IT HAS COME TO MEAN MORE BROADLY
LABORS TO AUGMENT HIS WEALTH BIRD SONGS FOREST GLENS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT MONOTONOUS IT IS THE LONG ROWS OF BROWN STONE FRONTS AND THE MILES OF PAVED STREETS THAT ARE SO TERRIBLY SAME
FOR IT IS THE PRINCIPAL IDEA IN YOUR DECLARATION AND YOU WILL PUT SOME EMPHASIS ON NOT ELSE YOUR HEARERS MAY THINK YOU ARE AFFIRMING THAT DESTINY IS A MATTER OF CHANCE BY ALL MEANS YOU MUST EMPHASIZE CHANCE
IF THE VICTROLA IN THE ADJOINING APARTMENT GRINDS OUT JUST THREE SELECTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS PRETTY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS NO OTHER RECORDS IF A SPEAKER USES ONLY A FEW OF HIS POWERS
C S BALDWIN WRITING AND SPEAKING THE GUN THAT SCATTERS TOO MUCH DOES NOT BAG THE BIRDS THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO SPEECH THE SPEAKER THAT FIRES HIS FORCE AND EMPHASIS AT RANDOM INTO A SENTENCE
THIS MAN RISKED HIS EMPIRE RATHER THAN PERMIT THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE OF HIS DOMINIONS YOU THINK ME A FANATIC TO NIGHT FOR YOU READ HISTORY NOT WITH YOUR EYES BUT WITH YOUR PREJUDICES BUT FIFTY YEARS HENCE
WENDELL PHILLIPS TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE PRACTISE ON THE FOLLOWING SELECTIONS FOR EMPHASIS BEECHER'S ABRAHAM LINCOLN PAGE SEVENTY SIX LINCOLN'S GETTYSBURG SPEECH PAGE FIFTY
ALL THE ACCUMULATED STORES ACHIEVED BY RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS THROUGH THOUSANDS OF YEARS ANONYMOUS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE NO STEEL RIVETED RULES OF EMPHASIS
WHAT RELATION DOES THIS HAVE TO THE USE OF THE VOICE FOUR WHICH WORDS SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED WHICH SUBORDINATED IN A SENTENCE FIVE READ THE SELECTIONS ON PAGES FIFTY
WHEN IS IT PERMISSIBLE TO EMPHASIZE EVERY SINGLE WORD IN A SENTENCE TEN NOTE THE EMPHASIS AND SUBORDINATION IN SOME CONVERSATION OR SPEECH YOU HAVE HEARD WERE THEY WELL MADE WHY
THIS MAN NEVER BROKE HIS WORD NO RETALIATION WAS HIS GREAT MOTTO AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE AND THE LAST WORDS UTTERED TO HIS SON IN FRANCE WERE THESE
DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE
BUT A POOR THING COMPARED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL TREE FOUND IN THE RICH MOIST BOTTOM LANDS BE NATURAL BUT IMPROVE YOUR NATURAL GIFTS UNTIL YOU HAVE APPROACHED THE IDEAL FOR WE MUST STRIVE AFTER IDEALIZED NATURE IN FRUIT
AS HE HAS SHOWN BY CONTRASTING IT WITH ANOTHER IDEA THESE LINES THEN WOULD READ LIKE THIS DESTINY IS NOT A MATTER OF CHANCE IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE NOW READ THIS OVER STRIKING THE WORDS IN CAPITALS
AND THE PLEASED PEOPLE NATURALLY SLIP INTO A BUYING MOOD HOW TO CONQUER MONOTONY WE OBVIATE MONOTONY IN DRESS BY REPLENISHING OUR WARDROBES WE AVOID MONOTONY IN SPEECH BY MULTIPLYING OUR POWERS OF SPEECH
BUT DO YOU IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE IT IS THERE THAT MONOTONY CAUSED BY LACK OF EMPHASIS IS SO PAINFULLY APPARENT SO FAR AS EMPHASIS IS CONCERNED YOU MAY CONSIDER THE AVERAGE SENTENCE AS JUST ONE BIG WORD
AND IS USED AS THE MOST CRUEL OF PUNISHMENTS IN OUR PRISONS IS THE THING THAT WILL DESTROY ALL THE LIFE AND FORCE OF A SPEECH AVOID IT AS YOU WOULD SHUN A DEADLY DULL BORE THE IDLE RICH CAN HAVE HALF A DOZEN HOMES
THEY TRY TO GET NEW INFORMATION OR A NEW SLANT THE NEWS THAT TAKES AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE MORNING EDITION WILL BE RELEGATED TO A SMALL SPACE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON EDITION WE ARE INTERESTED IN NEW IDEAS AND NEW FACTS
THE KIND OF FORCE THAT WE WANT APPLIED TO THE EMPHATIC WORD IS NOT ENTIRELY PHYSICAL TRUE THE EMPHATIC WORD MAY BE SPOKEN MORE LOUDLY OR IT MAY BE SPOKEN MORE SOFTLY BUT THE REAL QUALITY DESIRED IS INTENSITY
SEWARD'S IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT PAGE SIXTY SEVEN
IN THE SECOND SENTENCE OF THE STATEMENT THERE IS ONLY ONE IMPORTANT WORD CHOICE IT IS THE ONE WORD THAT POSITIVELY DEFINES THE QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT BEING DISCUSSED AND THE AUTHOR OF THOSE LINES DESIRED TO BRING IT OUT EMPHATICALLY
IN THIS CHAPTER HOWEVER WE ARE CONSIDERING ONLY ONE FORM OF EMPHASIS THAT OF APPLYING FORCE TO THE IMPORTANT WORD AND SUBORDINATING THE UNIMPORTANT WORDS DO NOT FORGET
MY HORSE IS NOT BLACK WHAT COLOR IMMEDIATELY COMES INTO MIND WHITE NATURALLY FOR THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF BLACK IF YOU WISH TO BRING OUT THE THOUGHT THAT DESTINY IS A MATTER OF CHOICE YOU CAN DO SO MORE EFFECTIVELY BY FIRST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE A WORD EMPHATIC DELIVER IT DIFFERENTLY FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WORDS SURROUNDING IT ARE DELIVERED IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING LOUDLY UTTER THE EMPHATIC WORD IN A CONCENTRATED WHISPER AND YOU HAVE INTENSE EMPHASIS
THIS PRINCIPLE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT BEARING IN DETERMINING YOUR EMPHASIS DO NOT EMPHASIZE THE SAME IDEA OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS YOU DESIRE TO LAY EXTRA STRESS ON IT SENATOR THURSTON DESIRED TO PUT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS ON FORCE
MONOTONY THE CARDINAL AND MOST COMMON SIN OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKER IS NOT A TRANSGRESSION IT IS RATHER A SIN OF OMISSION FOR IT CONSISTS IN LIVING UP TO THE CONFESSION OF THE PRAYER BOOK
WE MULTIPLY OUR POWERS OF SPEECH BY INCREASING OUR TOOLS THE CARPENTER HAS SPECIAL IMPLEMENTS WITH WHICH TO CONSTRUCT THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A BUILDING THE ORGANIST HAS CERTAIN KEYS AND STOPS
THE GREAT TRUTHS OF THE WORLD HAVE OFTEN BEEN COUCHED IN FASCINATING STORIES LES MISERABLES FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WISH TO TEACH OR INFLUENCE MEN YOU MUST PLEASE THEM FIRST OR LAST
SIX READ SOME SENTENCE REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZING A DIFFERENT WORD EACH TIME AND SHOW HOW THE MEANING IS CHANGED AS IS DONE ON PAGE TWENTY TWO SEVEN
FULTON AND MC CORMICK THEY WOULD BE WORTH MORE TO THE STATE THAN THAT TREASURE BOX NAMED CALIFORNIA OR MEXICO AND THE REAL SUPREMACY OF MAN IS BASED UPON HIS CAPACITY FOR EDUCATION
IN HIS SPEECH ON PAGE FIFTY NOTE HOW FORCE IS EMPHASIZED REPEATEDLY AS A GENERAL RULE HOWEVER THE NEW IDEA THE NEW SLANT WHETHER IN A NEWSPAPER REPORT OF A BATTLE OR A SPEAKER'S ENUNCIATION OF HIS IDEAS
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A GUIDE WHO AGREED TO SHOW NEW YORK TO A STRANGER AND THEN TOOK UP HIS TIME BY VISITING CHINESE LAUNDRIES AND BOOT BLACKING PARLORS ON THE SIDE STREETS
THEY ARE IGNORANT OF LAWS THAT MAKE FOR EFFICIENCY IN SPEAKING JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU REGARD AND USE THE LAWS THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO EXAMINE AND LEARN HOW TO USE WILL YOU HAVE EFFICIENCY AND FORCE IN YOUR SPEAKING
ITS CERTAIN TRIUMPH FROM PASS PROSPERITY AROUND BY ALBERT J BEVERIDGE BEFORE THE CHICAGO NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY
COMMAND ALL THE VARIETIES OF FOODS GATHERED FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH AND SAIL FOR AFRICA OR ALASKA AT THEIR PLEASURE BUT THE POVERTY STRICKEN MAN MUST WALK OR TAKE A STREET CAR HE DOES NOT HAVE THE CHOICE OF YACHT AUTO OR SPECIAL TRAIN
STRIKE THE SAME NOTE ON THE PIANO OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE DISPLEASING JARRING EFFECT MONOTONY HAS ON THE EAR THE DICTIONARY DEFINES MONOTONOUS AS BEING SYNONYMOUS WITH WEARISOME
MAN IS UNIQUE IN THE LENGTH OF HIS CHILDHOOD WHICH MEANS THE PERIOD OF PLASTICITY AND EDUCATION THE CHILDHOOD OF A MOTH THE DISTANCE THAT STANDS BETWEEN THE HATCHING OF THE ROBIN AND ITS MATURITY
I WOULD CALL HIM CROMWELL BUT CROMWELL WAS ONLY A SOLDIER AND THE STATE HE FOUNDED WENT DOWN WITH HIM INTO HIS GRAVE I WOULD CALL HIM WASHINGTON BUT THE GREAT VIRGINIAN HELD SLAVES
IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DESIGNATE WHICH WORD MUST AND WHICH MUST NOT BE EMPHASIZED ONE SPEAKER WILL PUT ONE INTERPRETATION ON A SPEECH ANOTHER SPEAKER WILL USE DIFFERENT EMPHASIS TO BRING OUT A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION
THAT IS PUTTING IT MILDLY IT IS MADDENING
YOU DO NOT EMPHASIZE EACH SYLLABLE ALIKE BUT HIT THE ACCENTED SYLLABLE WITH FORCE AND HURRY OVER THE UNIMPORTANT ONES NOW WHY DO YOU NOT APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE IN SPEAKING A SENTENCE TO SOME EXTENT YOU DO IN ORDINARY SPEECH
PUBLIC SPEAKING IS VERY MUCH LIKE CONVERSATION ENLARGED SOMETIMES FOR BIG EMPHASIS IT IS ADVISABLE TO LAY STRESS ON EVERY SINGLE SYLLABLE IN A WORD AS ABSOLUTELY IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
AND WHY DID NOT NOAH HAVE MOVING PICTURE ENTERTAINMENTS AND TALKING MACHINES ON THE ARK THE LAWS THAT ENABLE US TO OPERATE AN AUTOMOBILE PRODUCE MOVING PICTURES OR MUSIC ON THE VICTROLA WOULD HAVE WORKED JUST AS WELL THEN AS THEY DO TODAY
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES ONE WHAT IS EMPHASIS TWO DESCRIBE ONE METHOD OF DESTROYING MONOTONY OF THOUGHT PRESENTATION THREE
THE PARENTHETICAL EXPRESSIONS WOULD REALLY NOT BE NEEDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE EMPHATIC WORDS I INTENDED TO BUY A HOUSE THIS SPRING EVEN IF YOU DID NOT
IF YOU HAVE BEEN GOING FAST GO VERY SLOW ON THE EMPHATIC WORD IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ON A LOW PITCH JUMP TO A HIGH ONE ON THE EMPHATIC WORD IF YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ON A HIGH PITCH TAKE A LOW ONE ON YOUR EMPHATIC IDEAS
IF ALL THE REST OF THE WORDS IN THIS SENTENCE WERE MADE TEN TIMES AS LARGE AS THEY ARE AND DID AND THOUGHT WERE KEPT AT THEIR PRESENT SIZE THEY WOULD STILL BE EMPHATIC BECAUSE DIFFERENT
IT WAS IGNORANCE OF LAW THAT FOR AGES DEPRIVED HUMANITY OF OUR MODERN CONVENIENCES MANY SPEAKERS STILL USE OX CART METHODS IN THEIR SPEECH INSTEAD OF EMPLOYING AUTOMOBILE OR OVERLAND EXPRESS METHODS
IN A WIDE VARIETY OF EMPHASIS AND IN NICE SHADING OF THE GRADATIONS LIE THE EXCELLENCE OF EMPHATIC SPEECH I WOULD CALL HIM NAPOLEON BUT NAPOLEON MADE HIS WAY TO EMPIRE OVER BROKEN OATHS AND THROUGH A SEA OF BLOOD
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE IN ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE THERE ARE A FEW MOUNTAIN PEAK WORDS THAT REPRESENT THE BIG IMPORTANT IDEAS
HE BRINGS OUT SOMETIMES EVEN IN RED HEADLINES THE STRIKING NEWS OF THE DAY IT WOULD BE A BOON TO SPEECH MAKING IF SPEAKERS WOULD CONSERVE THE ATTENTION OF THEIR AUDIENCES IN THE SAME WAY
HE MUST SPEND THE MOST OF HIS LIFE IN LABOR AND BE CONTENT WITH THE STAPLES OF THE FOOD MARKET MONOTONY IS POVERTY WHETHER IN SPEECH OR IN LIFE STRIVE TO INCREASE THE VARIETY OF YOUR SPEECH AS THE BUSINESS MAN
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF A LACK OF EMPHASIS EIGHT READ THE SELECTIONS ON PAGES THIRTY AND FORTY EIGHT EMPHASIZING EVERY WORD WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON THE EMPHASIS NINE
WHY BECAUSE WE EXPECT AN ASTRONOMER TO DISCOVER HEAVENLY BODIES RATHER THAN COOKING RECIPES THE WORDS REPUBLIC NEEDS IN THE NEXT SENTENCE ARE EMPHATIC THEY INTRODUCE A NEW AND IMPORTANT IDEA
IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE OR IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE BOTH EQUALLY BAD CHARLES DANA THE FAMOUS EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK SUN
NO ONE CAN SAY THAT ONE INTERPRETATION IS RIGHT AND THE OTHER WRONG THIS PRINCIPLE MUST BE BORNE IN MIND IN ALL OUR MARKED EXERCISES HERE YOUR OWN INTELLIGENCE MUST GUIDE AND GREATLY TO YOUR PROFIT
THANKS TO THE EDITOR HE DOES NOT TELL ABOUT A HOLD UP IN HONG KONG IN THE SAME SIZED TYPE AS HE USES TO REPORT THE DEATH OF FIVE FIREMEN IN YOUR HOME CITY SIZE OF TYPE IS HIS DEVICE TO SHOW EMPHASIS IN BOLD RELIEF
THE MOST EMPHATIC WORDS ARE ITALICIZED IN THIS SELECTION ARE THERE ANY OTHERS YOU WOULD EMPHASIZE WHY THE OLD ASTRONOMER SAID GIVE ME A LARGER EYE AND I WILL DISCOVER NEW STARS AND SUNS
NATURE IN HER WEALTH GIVES US ENDLESS VARIETY MAN WITH HIS LIMITATIONS IS OFTEN MONOTONOUS GET BACK TO NATURE IN YOUR METHODS OF SPEECH MAKING THE POWER OF VARIETY LIES IN ITS PLEASURE GIVING QUALITY
PRACTISE IF NO ONE ELSE WILL LISTEN TO YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF YOU MUST ALWAYS BE YOUR OWN BEST CRITIC AND THE SEVEREST ONE OF ALL
WHEN TRUTH GETS A HEARING THE MUSE OF HISTORY WILL PUT PHOCION FOR THE GREEK AND BRUTUS FOR THE ROMAN HAMPDEN FOR ENGLAND LAFAYETTE FOR FRANCE CHOOSE WASHINGTON AS THE BRIGHT CONSUMMATE FLOWER OF OUR EARLIER CIVILIZATION
THE TECHNICAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE LAY DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS ARE NOT ARBITRARY CREATIONS OF OUR OWN THEY ARE ALL FOUNDED ON THE PRACTICES THAT GOOD SPEAKERS AND ACTORS ADOPT EITHER NATURALLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY OR UNDER INSTRUCTION
A FIFTH AVENUE BUS WOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION UP AT MINISINK FORD NEW YORK
FORCE FEELING AND LIFE FORGET ALL ELSE BUT NOT THIS WHEN YOU HAVE MASTERED THE MECHANICS OF SPEECH OUTLINED IN THE NEXT FEW CHAPTERS YOU WILL NO LONGER BE TROUBLED WITH MONOTONY
HIS BIG THOUGHTS STAND LIKE HUGE OAKS HIS IDEAS OF NO ESPECIAL VALUE ARE MERELY LIKE THE GRASS AROUND THE TREE FROM ALL THIS WE MAY DEDUCE THIS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE EMPHASIS IS A MATTER OF CONTRAST AND COMPARISON
THE LITTLE STRAWBERRY UP IN THE ARCTICS WITH A FEW TINY SEEDS AND AN ACID TANG IS A NATURAL BERRY BUT IT IS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE IMPROVED VARIETY THAT WE ENJOY HERE THE DWARFED OAK ON THE ROCKY HILLSIDE IS NATURAL
WHICH HE MANIPULATES TO PRODUCE HIS HARMONIES AND EFFECTS IN LIKE MANNER THE SPEAKER HAS CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS AND TOOLS AT HIS COMMAND BY WHICH HE BUILDS HIS ARGUMENT PLAYS ON THE FEELINGS AND GUIDES THE BELIEFS OF HIS AUDIENCE
THIS MAN WITH THE LARGER EYE SAYS HE WILL DISCOVER NOT RIVERS OR SAFETY APPLIANCES FOR AEROPLANES BUT NEW STARS AND SUNS NEW STARS AND SUNS ARE HARDLY AS EMPHATIC AS THE WORD LARGER
SO LET US LOOK AT THE NATURE AND THE CURSE OF MONOTONY IN OTHER SPHERES OF LIFE THEN WE SHALL APPRECIATE MORE FULLY HOW IT WILL BLIGHT AN OTHERWISE GOOD SPEECH
HAD WOULD ARE ALL EMPHATIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN MADE DIFFERENT HE LOOKED AT HER IN ANGRY ASTONISHMENT WELL WHAT DO YOU CALL IT IF IT ISN'T COWARDICE TO SLINK OFF AND MARRY A DEFENSELESS GIRL LIKE THAT
LITTLE DID JAN AND MARIE DREAM AS THEY LISTENED THAT THIS BLESSING RESTED UPON THEIR OWN FATHER AND THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE BELGIAN SOLDIERS WHO FIRING FROM THE TRENCHES HAD DELIVERED THEM FROM THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES
HE FOUND UPON WEIGHING THESE AFTER A NIGHT'S EXPOSURE UNDER A CLEAR SKY THAT THE COTTON WOOL ON TOP OF THE BOARD HAD GAINED FOURTEEN GRAINS IN WEIGHT FROM THE MOISTURE OR DEW THAT HAD FORMED UPON IT
YOU WERE BRAVE BOYS IF YOU HAD NOT STARTED THE BOAT WHEN YOU DID IT IS QUITE LIKELY THEY MIGHT HAVE GOT ME AFTER ALL AND THE POTATOES TOO I AM PROUD OF YOU BUT FATHER CRIED JOSEPH WHO COULD HAVE FIRED THOSE SHOTS
AND SHE HASN'T CRAWLED UP TO IT YET I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE'D GO TO SLEEP SOME DAY AND FALL INTO THE RIVER AND NEVER WAKE UP WHY I AM ALMOST ASLEEP MYSELF SHE'LL WAKE UP FAST ENOUGH WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT AND SO WILL YOU
THAT IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE INHABITANTS OF HOT COUNTRIES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ICE AND IN OUR OWN LAND FOR STORING IT PERHAPS EVERYONE WHO HAS LIVED IN THE COUNTRY HAS NOTICED THAT ON A SUMMER'S MORNING WHEN THE GRASS IS LADEN WITH DEWDROPS
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEAD CINDER FLOATING IN SPACE AND NOT SURROUNDED BY AN ATMOSPHERE SO THAT THE SUN'S RAYS HAVE FULL EFFECT UPON IT DURING THE TIME IT IS EXPOSED TO THEM
CHAPTER FOURTEEN HOW DEW IS FORMED READER DID YOU EVER LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WERE YOU EVER AWAKENED EARLY ON A SUMMER'S MORNING TO GO FOR THE COWS DID YOU EVER WADE THROUGH A WHEAT FIELD IN JUNE
BUT PERHAPS IT SEEMED TO THE GOOD NATURED SKIPPER
WHISPERED MOTHER DE SMET YOU ROAR LIKE A FOGHORN ON A DARK NIGHT THE GERMANS WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN FINDING OUT ABOUT THE POTATOES IF YOU SHOUT THE NEWS ALL OVER THE LANDSCAPE FATHER DE SMET LOOKED OUT OVER THE QUIET BELGIAN FIELDS
AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT IT GOOD FUN BUT BY AND BY AS THE SUN GREW HOT DRIVING A MULE ON A TOW PATH DID NOT SEEM QUITE SO PLEASANT A TASK AS THEY HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I'M TIRED OF THIS SAID JAN AT LAST TO MARIE
OH MY SOUL SHE CRIED IN ASTONISHMENT WHAT A CLEVER BOY YOU MUST BE TO LEARN SO QUICKLY TO HANDLE THE TILLER WHERE IS FATHER DE SMET HERE BOOMED A LOUD VOICE BEHIND HER
AND IN THE LATTER CASE THERE IS A CONSTANT CHANGE OF AIR SO THAT IN EITHER CASE NO PART OF IT IS ALLOWED TO COOL DOWN SUFFICIENTLY TO PRECIPITATE MOISTURE
IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY METEOROLOGISTS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WATER CONDENSED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF DEW AMOUNTS TO AS MUCH AS FIVE INCHES OR ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE THAT IS EVAPORATED INTO THE AIR
PROVED TO BE A PLEASANT SHELTERED SPOT WITH GRASSY BANKS SLOPING DOWN TO THE WATER A TURN IN THE RIVER ENABLED THEM TO DRAW THE OLD WOMAN UP INTO THEIR SHADOWS AND BECAUSE THE TREES WERE GREEN AND THE BOAT WAS GREEN THE REFLECTIONS IN THE WATER WERE ALSO GREEN
IT WAS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THE OLD WOMAN AT LAST APPROACHED THE TWINKLING LIGHTS OF ANTWERP AND THEY KNEW THAT FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST THEY WERE SAFE THEY WORE NOW BEYOND THE GERMAN LINES IN COUNTRY STILL HELD BY THE BELGIANS
AND SLAPPED HER FLANK WITH A LONG BRANCH OF WILLOW NOW NETTEKE WAS A PROUD MULE AND SHE WASN'T USED TO BEING SLAPPED FATHER DE SMET KNEW HER WAYS AND KNEW ALSO THAT HER STEADY EVEN SLOW PACE
ONE OF THEM LYING ON THE GRASS AND THE OTHER SUSPENDED TWO FEET ABOVE IT WE SHALL FIND THAT THE ONE LYING ON THE GRASS WILL READ EIGHT OR TEN DEGREES LOWER THAN THE ONE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IF THE NIGHT IS STILL
YOU HAVE MADE NO END OF TROUBLE FOR US AND GAINED NOTHING FOR YOURSELF NOW I AM AFRAID WE SHAN'T GET BEYOND THE GERMAN LINES BEFORE DARK WE MAY EVEN HAVE TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN DANGEROUS TERRITORY AND ALL BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST AS MULISH AS
IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT DEW PERFORMS AN IMPORTANT PART IN SUPPORTING VEGETATION THE SAME OPERATION IN NATURE'S GREAT WORKSHOP THAT FORMS THE DEWS OF SUMMER CREATES THE FROSTS OF WINTER
PULLED HER PATIENT NOSE OUT OF A DELICIOUS BUNCH OF THISTLES AND STARTED HER UP THE TOW PATH
INSTEAD HE GOT A SALUTE FROM THE BELGIANS HE CROSSED HIMSELF REVERENTLY THANK GOD FOR OUR SOLDIERS HE SAID AND MOTHER DE SMET WEEPING SOFTLY MURMURED A DEVOUT AMEN
AND AT THAT TIME IT BECOMES HEATED TO A TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FOR HALF THE MONTH SAY THE SUN IS SHINING CONTINUOUSLY UPON ALL OR A PART OF IT
IN OTHER WORDS THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THE MOON ARE ABOUT TWO WEEKS LONG THE MOON DOES NOT REVOLVE UPON ITS OWN AXIS LIKE THE EARTH THEREFORE THE SAME SIDE OR A PORTION OF IT IS EXPOSED TO THE SUN FOR FOURTEEN DAYS
IT WILL REQUIRE A GREATER AMOUNT OF DEPRESSION OF TEMPERATURE TO CAUSE CONDENSATION AND THIS IS WHY WE USUALLY HAVE HEAVIER DEWS IN JUNE WHEN THE AIR IS MORE HIGHLY CHARGED WITH MOISTURE
HE SAID TO FATHER DE SMET IT'S A BALKY MULE REPLIED FATHER DE SMET MILDLY AND VERY OBSTINATE INDEED SNEERED THE SOLDIER THEN I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NAMED HIM ALBERT AFTER YOUR PIG HEADED KING
WHEN SHE HAS MADE UP HER MIND SHE IS AS DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE AS A SETTING HEN MOTHER DE SMET'S HEAD APPEARED BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S OVER THE BOAT RAIL OH DEAR SAID SHE I HOPED WE SHOULD GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE BEFORE DARK
OR THE LONG GRASS OF A MEADOW WHEN THE PEARLY DEWDROPS HUNG IN CLUSTERS ON THE BEARDED GRAIN SHINING LIKE BRILLIANTS IN THE MORNING SUN
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRIVE THE MULE AWHILE HE ASKED OH WOULDN'T I
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE SHOUTED OH DEAR SAID JAN TO MARIE I HOPED HE WOULDN'T NOTICE THAT THE BOAT WASN'T MOVING NETTEKE HAS STOPPED SHE WON'T GO AT ALL I THINK SHE'S RUN DOWN MARIE CALLED BACK
BUT NETTEKE HAD DONE HER BALKING FOR THE DAY AND HAVING BEEN REFRESHED BY HER LUNCHEON OF GREEN GRASS SHE WAS READY TO MOVE ON THE RIVER HAD NOW QUITE A CURRENT WHICH HELPED THEM AND WHILE THE SOLDIERS WERE STILL HAVING THEIR JOKE WITH FATHER DE SMET
AND IN A MEASURE PREVENT THE HEAT FROM RADIATING FROM THE EARTH IMMEDIATELY UNDER IT FROST WHICH OF COURSE IS BUT FROZEN DEW AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR WILL FORM ON A STILL AUTUMN NIGHT
AND SAT DOWN ON THE DECK IN FRONT OF THE CABIN TO EAT IT
ALTHOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AT SOME DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND IS SOME DEGREES ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT THE REASON FOR THIS WILL BE OBVIOUS WHEN WE CONSIDER THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN SET FORTH CONCERNING THE POWER OF RADIATION TO PRODUCE COLD
I DON'T SEE WHY THEY WERE EVER BORN FATHER DE SMET BECAME SERIOUS AT ONCE SON HE SAID STERNLY
LEAVING THE PAIL IN FRONT OF HER HE WENT BACK TO THE BOAT THE GANGPLANK WAS PUT OUT AND HE AND MARIE WENT ON BOARD THEY FOUND DINNER READY IN THE TINY CABIN AND BECAUSE IT WAS SO SMALL AND STUFFY AND THERE WERE TOO MANY OF THEM ANYWAY TO GET INTO IT COMFORTABLY
IT WAS LEVEL OPEN COUNTRY ALL ABOUT THEM DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH FARMHOUSES AND IN THE DISTANCE THE SPIRE OF A VILLAGE CHURCH ROSE ABOVE THE CLUSTERING HOUSES AND POINTED TO THE SKY YES YES CHILD GO AHEAD SAID FATHER DE SMET
DURING THE TIME THAT THE MOON IS IN THE EARTH'S SHADOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO FALL TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WHEN THE MOON IS FULL
AS I FIGURE IT OUT SAID FATHER DE SMET WE MUST HAVE STOPPED VERY NEAR THE TRENCHES AND OUR OWN MEN MUST HAVE SEEN THE GERMANS ATTACK US MY GERMAN FRIEND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN FOLLOWING US UP MEANING TO GET EVERYTHING WE HAD AND ME TOO
HOCH DER KAISER FATHER DE SMET LOOKED THEM IN THE FACE AND SAID NOT A WORD MEANWHILE JAN AND JOSEPH TO MOTHER DE SMET'S GREAT ALARM HAD NOT FOLLOWED HER ON TO THE BOAT
THE HEAT COMING FROM A FULL MOON ON A CLEAR NIGHT IS ABSORBED IN CAUSING THE AQUEOUS VAPORS THAT ARE PARTLY CONDENSED IN THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO BE REABSORBED INTO TRANSPARENT VAPOR
ON THE TOW PATH WHEN THEY COULD NO LONGER SEE GRANNY NOR HEAR FIDEL THE CHILDREN SAT DOWN ON A COIL OF ROPE BEHIND THE CABIN AND FELT VERY MISERABLE INDEED
WHILE THE SAME AMOUNT OF COTTON ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE BOARD HAD ONLY INCREASED FOUR GRAINS HE TRIED FURTHER EXPERIMENTS BY MAKING LITTLE PAPER HOUSES OR BOXES TO COVER A CERTAIN PORTION OF GRASS OR VEGETATION
AND NETTEKE ASSISTED BY THE CURRENT MADE BETTER SPEED THAN SHE HAD AT ANY TIME DURING THE DAY MEANWHILE HIS CAPTORS WERE BUSY WITH FATHER DE SMET COME DRINK TO THE KAISER SHOUTED THE FIRST SOLDIER OR WE'LL FEED YOU TO THE FISHES
THERE IS NO HURRY AFTER SUPPER WILL DO BUT FIRST WE'LL DRINK A HEALTH TO THE KAISER AND SINCE YOU ARE HOST HERE YOU SHALL PROPOSE IT HE POINTED TO THE PAIL OF MILK WHICH FATHER DE SMET STILL HELD NOW HE SHOUTED
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID A LOUD VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM FATHER DE SMET WAS SO STARTLED THAT HE DROPPED THE EGGS HE WHIRLED ABOUT AND THERE STOOD THE GERMAN SOLDIER WHO HAD TOLD NETTEKE TO HALT WITH HIM WERE SIX OTHER MEN
RADIATION INTO THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHECKED WHICH CAUSES A SUDDEN RISE IN THE TEMPERATURE NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OF HEAT RADIATION FROM THE EARTH'S SURFACE
WHEN FATHER DE SMET RETURNED SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY HE SNIFFED APPRECIATIVELY AS HE APPEARED UNDER THE TREES SMELLS GOOD HE SAID
KNOWING THAT HIS CARELESSNESS HAD CAUSED THE TROUBLE YET NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO TO HELP NEVER MIND SON SAID MOTHER DE SMET KINDLY WHEN SHE CAME BACK FOR HER POTATOES AND SAW HIS DOWNCAST FACE
WAS PARTLY HIDDEN FROM THE GROUP BY A BUNCH OF YOUNG WILLOWS NEAR THE WATER'S EDGE AND WITH GREAT SPEED AND PRESENCE OF MIND HAD SLIPPED HER BRIDLE OVER HER HEAD AND GENTLY STARTED HER UP THE TOW PATH OH MURMURED JOSEPH SUPPOSE SHE SHOULD BALK
WHILE FATHER DE SMET SEIZED A LONG POLE AND HURRIED FORWARD JOSEPH LEFT THE MULE TO BROWSE UPON THE GRASS BESIDE THE TOW PATH AND RAN BACK TO THE BOAT HIS FATHER THREW HIM A POLE WHICH WAS KEPT FOR SUCH EMERGENCIES AND THEY BOTH PUSHED
I HAVE ANSWERED MARIE BUT SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT THEN IT'S NO USE SAID FATHER DE SMET MOURNFULLY SHE'S BALKED AND THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SHE IS READY TO GO AGAIN
AND THE NECESSARY DEPRESSION IS NOT REACHED IN THESE CASES EXCEPT AT AN ALTITUDE OF SEVERAL MILES DOCTOR WELLS HAS SHOWN THAT IF WE TAKE THE READING OF TWO THERMOMETERS ON A CLEAR SUMMER NIGHT
BECAUSE THE MOMENT THE SUN'S RAYS ARE WITHDRAWN THE HEAT IS RAPIDLY RADIATED BY THE BLADES OF GRASS WHICH COOLS THE EARTH UNDER IT AND THE AIR ABOVE AND SURROUNDING IT SO THAT IF THE AIR IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE MOISTURE SATURATION POINT
AND FOR THIS REASON THE BOAT SEEMED VERY WELL HIDDEN FROM VIEW I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHALL BE NOTICED HERE SAID FATHER DE SMET IT'S HOT ON THE BOAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO TAKE THE BABIES ASHORE WHILE WE EAT SAID MOTHER DE SMET RUNNING OUT THE GANGPLANK
AND DEW WILL FORM IF HOWEVER IT IS CLOUDY OR THE WIND IS BLOWING THERE IS RARELY ANY FORMATION OF DEW THE REASON IN THE FORMER CASE AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED IS THAT THE RADIATED HEAT IS HELD DOWN TO THE EARTH IN A MEASURE
I WANT TO SEND OVER THERE SHE POINTED TO A FARMHOUSE NOT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER AND GET SOME MILK AND EGGS VERY WELL SAID HER HUSBAND WE'LL STOP UNDER THAT BUNCH OF WILLOWS THE BUNCH OF WILLOWS BESIDE THE RIVER WHICH HE POINTED OUT
LOOKING FEARFULLY ABOUT TO SEE IF HE COULD SEE ANY GERMANS FOR AN INSTANT FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE TILLER THERE WAS A JERK ON THE TOW ROPE AND A BUMP AS THE NOSE OF THE OLD WOMAN RAN INTO THE RIVER BANK NETTEKE THE MULE CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP
IN COLD WEATHER WE CALL IT FROST IT HAS BEEN STATED IN A FORMER CHAPTER ON EVAPORATION THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE AIR FOR HOLDING MOISTURE IN A TRANSPARENT FORM DEPENDS UPON ITS TEMPERATURE IF THE TEMPERATURE IS AT THE FREEZING POINT
JOSEPH PUSHED ON THE BOAT
BUT IF NETTEKE'S SET SHE'S SET AND WE MUST JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT IT'S LUCKY IT'S DINNER TIME WE'LL EAT AND MAYBE BY THE TIME WE ARE THROUGH SHE'LL BE WILLING TO START FATHER DE SMET TOSSED A BUCKET ON TO THE GRASS
AS A MULE HE FINISHED HELPLESSLY JOSEPH LAUGHED CAN'T YOU THINK OF ANYTHING MULISHER THAN A MULE HE SAID THERE ISN'T A THING
YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND SHE CRIED FATHER DE SMET TOLD ME ESPECIALLY TO KEEP AWAY FROM NETTEKE'S HIND LEGS POOH
THERE WAS HER HUSBAND LEFT ALONE TO FACE SEVEN ENEMIES SHE WRUNG HER HANDS MAYBE THEY WILL STOP TO EAT THE ONIONS SHE GROANED TO HERSELF SHE HELD TO THE GANGPLANK AND MURMURED PRAYERS TO ALL THE SAINTS SHE KNEW
BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DOCTOR WELLS MADE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH FLOCKS OF COTTON WOOL HE WEIGHED OUT PIECES OF EQUAL WEIGHT
IT WAS AS FAMILIAR TO THE ANCIENTS AS IT IS TO US AND YET IT IS ONLY ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY SINCE THE CAUSE OF IT HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD WE EVEN YET SPEAK OF THE DEW FALLING LIKE RAIN
HERE IN A SUBURB OF THE CITY FATHER DE SMET DECIDED TO DOCK FOR THE NIGHT A DISTANT CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN AS THE HUNGRY BUT THANKFUL FAMILY GATHERED UPON THE DECK OF THE OLD WOMAN TO EAT A MEAGER SUPPER OF BREAD AND CHEESE
A GRAVEL WALK OR A DUSTY ROAD WILL BE PERFECTLY DRY THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE GRAVEL WILL RETAIN HEAT AND NOT RADIATE IT FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME THAN GRASS OR GREEN LEAVES DEW BEGINS TO FORM UPON THE GRASS VERY SOON AFTER THE SUN IS SET
THERE WILL BE A COLD STRATUM OF AIR NEXT TO THE EARTH
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE BLADES OF GRASS STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY THAT EVER FLASHED IN THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF A BALLROOM IF NOT YOU HAVE MISSED A PICTURE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNG ON THE WALLS OF YOUR MEMORY
YOU RUN AND SEE IF YOU CAN'T HELP FATHER WITH THE TILLER AND MARIE WOULD YOU MIND PLAYING WITH THE BABIES WHILE I PUT ON THE SOUP KETTLE AND FIX THE GREENS FOR DINNER THEY ARE BEGINNING TO CLIMB EVERYWHERE NOW AND I AM AFRAID THEY WILL FALL OVERBOARD
FOR HE ONLY SAID MILDLY STICK TO YOUR JOB SON WHATEVER IT IS AND WENT ON COVERING HIS POTATOES WITH EMPTY BOXES AND PIECES OF SAILCLOTH JAN PAID SUCH STRICT ATTENTION TO THE TILLER AFTER THAT
SOUNDS OF THE SKIRMISH CONTINUED TO REACH THEIR EARS EVEN WHEN THEY HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE DOWN THE RIVER AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWILIGHT HAD DEEPENED INTO DUSK AND THEY WERE HIDDEN IN ITS SHADOWS THAT THEY DARED HOPE THE DANGER WAS PASSED
AS HE OVERTOOK IT MOTHER DE SMET RAN OUT THE GANG PLANK BOYS SHOUTED FATHER DE SMET GET ABOARD GET ABOARD JOSEPH AND JAN INSTANTLY STOPPED THE MULE AND DROPPING THE REINS RACED UP THE GANGPLANK
AND MOTHER DE SMET SAT DOWN EQUALLY SUDDENLY ON A COIL OF ROPE HER POTATOES SPILLED OVER THE DECK WHILE A WAIL FROM THE FRONT OF THE BOAT ANNOUNCED THAT ONE OF THE BABIES HAD BUMPED TOO MOTHER DE SMET PICKED HERSELF UP AND RAN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE BABY
BUT MOTHER DE SMET WAS NO LONGER TENDING THEM THE INSTANT SHE HEARD THE GRUFF VOICE SHE HAD DROPPED HER SPOON AND SEIZING A BABY UNDER EACH ARM HAD FLED UP THE GANGPLANK ON TO THE BOAT
HE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY MULE ALIVE I GUESS IF I CAN HARNESS A HORSE AND DRIVE HOME A LOAD OF GRAIN FROM THE FIELD THERE ISN'T MUCH I CAN'T DO WITH A MULE TO PROVE HIS WORDS HE SHOUTED U U
THE WRITER HAS SEEN FLOWERS BLOOMING ABUNDANTLY AT AN ALTITUDE OF TWELVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL PROTECTED ONLY BY THE FRIENDLY SHELTER OF A SNOWBANK IN SOME CASES THE BLOOMING FLOWERS WERE IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE SNOW
ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS GAVE A HOWL AND FELL TO THE GROUND STILL NO ONE APPEARED AT WHOM THE GERMANS COULD DIRECT THEIR FIRE SNIPERS SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS INSTANTLY LOWERING THEIR GUNS
MAY I COME ABOARD NOW HE SHOUTED
HEAT RADIATION FROM THE EARTH GOES ON IN WINTER WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT A THICK COVERING OF SNOW IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO VEGETATION AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF FROST
THERE'S NOBODY ABOUT THAT I CAN SEE HE SAID BUT I'LL ROAR MORE GENTLY NEXT TIME THERE WAS A BEND IN THE RIVER JUST AT THIS POINT
HAVE YOU EVER DRIVEN A MULE BEFORE FATHER DE SMET ASKED AGAIN NOT A MULE EXACTLY JAIL REPLIED BUT I DROVE OLD PIER UP FROM THE FIELD WITH A LOAD OF WHEAT ALL BY MYSELF MOTHER SAT ON THE LOAD COME ALONG
THE BOAT MOVED QUIETLY OUT OF SIGHT AS SHE FELT IT MOVE MOTHER DE SMET LIFTED HER HEAD OVER THE BOAT'S RAIL BEHIND WHICH SHE AND THE CHILDREN WERE HIDING AND RAISED THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SO THAT IT WOULD MAKE NO NOISE BY SCRAPING ALONG THE GROUND
HE SAID AND COME ABOARD YOURSELVES JAN FILLED THE BUCKET FROM THE RIVER AND SET IT DOWN BEFORE NETTEKE BUT SHE WAS IN NO MOOD FOR BLANDISHMENTS SHE KEPT HER EARS BACK AND WOULD NOT TOUCH THE WATER ALL RIGHT THEN CROSSPATCH
WHERE THE BABIES HAD ROOM TO ROLL ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LATER WHEN MOTHER DE SMET WENT BACK TO GET SOME POTATOES FOR THE SOUP
WHEN THE AIR IS CHARGED WITH THIS VAPOR TO THE POINT OF SATURATION WHICH POINT VARIES WITH THE TEMPERATURE A SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE TEMPERATURE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONDENSE THIS VAPOR INTO CLOUD OR DROPS OF WATER
IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT OFTEN THERE WILL BE A HEAVIER DEW UNDER THE BLAZE OF A FULL MOON ON A CLEAR NIGHT THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME THE MOON HAS NO SCREENS ABOUT IT OF ANY KIND TO OBSTRUCT THE FREE RADIATION OF HEAT
THAT NO ONE COULD ROB YOU OF EVERYONE HAS NOTICED THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE YEAR THE GRASS BECOMES WET IN THE EVENING AND GROWS MORE SO TILL THE SUN RISES THE NEXT DAY AND DISPELS THE MOISTURE AND THIS WHEN NO CLOUD IS SEEN
BUT IF THE NIGHT IS CLOUDY THERE WILL BE LITTLE OR NO DEW FORMED THE CLOUDS FORM A SCREEN BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH PREVENTS THE HEAT FROM RADIATING TO A SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO FORM DEW
AND SOON THE OLD WOMAN WAS ONCE MORE GLIDING SMOOTHLY OVER THE QUIET WATER TOWARD ANTWERP WHEN FATHER DE SMET CAME BACK TO THE STERN OF THE BOAT
THEY MEANT TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BY PROLONGING MY MISERY AND THEY LINGERED JUST A BIT TOO LONG
SHOUTED FATHER DE SMET TO JOSEPH
ALMOST BEFORE THE END OF IT RESTED SAFELY ON THE GROUND FATHER DE SMET SNATCHED UP THE REINS ON WENT THE BOAT AT NETTEKE'S BEST SPEED WHICH SEEMED NO BETTER THAN A SNAIL'S PACE TO THE FLEEING FAMILY
ONLY DON'T GET TOO NEAR NETTEKE'S HIND LEGS SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND SOMETIMES SHE FORGETS HER MANNERS
I THINK TOO MUCH OF MY KING TO NAME MY MULE AFTER HIM OH HO SAID THE GERMAN THEN PERHAPS YOU HAVE NAMED HIM FOR THE KAISER NETTEKE HAD MARCHED STEADILY ALONG DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND THEY WERE NOW PAST THE SOLDIER
SHE AND JAN BROUGHT OUT THE ONIONS AND A PAN AND SOON THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF FRYING ONIONS JOSEPH AND JAN SLIPPED THE BRIDLE OVER NETTEKE'S COLLAR
WE WANT OUR SUPPER AND YOU DELAY US STILL FATHER DE SMET SAID NOTHING WE'LL GIVE YOU JUST UNTIL I COUNT TEN SAID THE SOLDIER POINTING HIS GUN AT HIM AND IF BY THAT TIME YOU HAVE NOT FOUND YOUR TONGUE BUT HE DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE
MARIE HELD A HANDFUL OF FRESH GRASS JUST OUT OF REACH OF HER MOUTH BUT NETTEKE WAS REALLY OFFENDED SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO GET IT SHE SIMPLY STAYED WHERE SHE WAS FATHER DE SMET STUCK HIS HEAD OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT
I BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE SUPPER ON THE GRASS YOU HURRY ALONG AND GET THE MILK AND EGGS AND I'LL COOK SOME ONIONS WHILE YOU ARE GONE JAN AND MARIE RAN OVER THE PLANK AT ONCE AND MOTHER DE SMET SOON FOLLOWED WITH THE BABIES THEN WHILE MARIE WATCHED THEM
SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH ANXIETY IF SHE SCREAMED OR SAID ANYTHING TO THE BOYS THE ATTENTION OF THE SOLDIERS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE DIRECTED TOWARD THEM YET IF THEY SHOULD BY ANY MIRACLE SUCCEED IN GETTING AWAY
WHO ALREADY HAD TAKEN UP NETTEKE'S REINS AND WAS WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL TO START JOSEPH TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE TILLER AND AGAIN THE OLD WOMAN MOVED SLOWLY DOWN THE STREAM FOR SOME TIME JAN AND MARIE PLODDED ALONG WITH NETTEKE
IN FORMER TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS SUPPOSED THAT IT WAS A FINE RAIN THAT FELL FROM THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE OTHERS SUPPOSED IT TO BE AN EMANATION FROM THE EARTH
AND AT LAST MOTHER DE SMET CALLED TO HER HUSBAND OVER THE BOATSIDE I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO STOP SOON AND FEED THE MULE OR SHE WILL BE TOO TIRED TO GET US ACROSS THE LINE AT ALL I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SAVE TIME BY STOPPING FOR SUPPER BESIDES
AS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE COLD THAT IS PRODUCED BY RADIATION THROUGH THE BLADES OF GRASS AND OTHER RADIATING SUBSTANCES MAY BE INDICATED BY PLACING ONE THERMOMETER ON THE GROUND AND FIXING ANOTHER AT SOME POINT IN THE AIR
SOMETIMES THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED AMOUNTING TO AS MUCH AS TWENTY OR THIRTY DEGREES IF UNDER THESE CONDITIONS A CLOUD FLOATS OVERHEAD FORMING A HEAT SCREEN
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NONE WITHIN THE INCLOSURE THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN VARIOUS WAYS AND CLOSELY WATCHED TO SEE THAT NONE OF THE PHENOMENA WERE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH FALLING RAIN
IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE OLD WOMAN HAS STUCK HER NOSE IN THE MUD AND WITH OLDER PEOPLE THAN YOU AT THE TILLER TOO WE'LL SOON HAVE HER OFF AGAIN AND NO HARM DONE THE BOAT GAVE A LITTLE LURCH TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
AND IS HEATED UP TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DEGREES THERE IS SUFFICIENT HEAT RADIATING FROM IT TO BE FELT SENSIBLY UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND IT WOULD BE FELT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE GREAT ENVELOPE OF ATMOSPHERE
IGNORING MARIE'S REMARK I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO HE WENT ON CHUCKLING I'LL GET SOME BURRS AND STICK THEM IN HER TAIL AND THEN EVERY TIME SHE SLAPS THE FLIES OFF SHE'LL MAKE HERSELF GO FASTER MARIE SEIZED JAN'S ARM
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN FIRE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE UNSEEN ENEMY THERE WAS SUCH A PATTER OF BULLETS ABOUT THEM THAT THEY TURNED AND FLED FATHER DE SMET FLED TOO HE LEAPED OVER THE FRYING PAN AND TORE DOWN THE RIVER BANK AFTER THE BOAT
SAID MARIE WITH PROFOUND WISDOM
WAS BETTER IN THE LONG RUN THAN TO ATTEMPT TO FORCE A LIVELIER GAIT AND NETTEKE WAS WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HER SHE RESENTED BEING INTERFERED WITH INSTEAD OF GOING FORWARD AT GREATER SPEED SHE PUT HER FOUR FEET TOGETHER
ON COOLING AT THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IT WILL READILY GIVE UP A PART OF ITS MOISTURE WHICH CONDENSES IN DROPS UPON THE BLADES OF GRASS IF THE NIGHT IS STILL AND CLEAR AND THERE IS MUCH MOISTURE IN THE AIR THE DEW WILL BE HEAVY
TRY COAXING HER CRIED THE SKIPPER GIVE HER SOMETHING TO EAT
IF IT IS SIXTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT THE AIR WILL RETAIN SIX GRAINS OF TRANSPARENT MOISTURE TO THE SQUARE FOOT OF AIR WHILE AT EIGHTY DEGREES IT WILL CONTAIN NEARLY ELEVEN GRAINS
THERE ARE SPIDERS AND RATS AND BALKY MULES AND GERMANS AND IT DOESN'T DO A BIT OF GOOD TO WASTE WORDS FUSSING BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE THE THING TO DO IS TO DEAL WITH THEM FATHER DE SMET WAS SO MUCH IN EARNEST
THIS CLEARS AWAY THE HEAT SCREEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ALLOWS RADIATION TO GO ON MORE RAPIDLY AT THE EARTH'S SURFACE AND THUS COOLS IT TO A GREATER EXTENT WHEN THE MOON IS SHINING BRIGHTLY THAN WHEN IT IS DARK AND IN THE SHADOW OF THE EARTH
LOOK ALIVE THERE MATE SANG OUT FATHER DE SMET HARD APORT WITH THE TILLER HEAD HER OUT INTO THE STREAM JOSEPH FLUNG HIS POLE TO HIS FATHER
THAT IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH DREADFUL THINGS WERE GOING ON ALL ABOUT THEM
AND HERE IS A DAMASK NAPKIN FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND THE WASHSTAND AND EVERYTHING STANDS ON A MAT I WONDER IF THIS IS TO BE MY ROOM IT IS PROBABLY THE CHAMBER FOR VISITORS WHY
THAT SOME CONSIDERATE FRIEND TOOK HIM OUT AND AUNT MERCE WEPT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE GREW FAINT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF ME I GAVE HER THE FLACON OF SALTS WHICH REVIVED HER BUT I FELT AS FATHER LOOKED STERN
WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAW MOTHER IN HER OLD PLACE HER SURROUNDINGS UNALTERED I SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFERRING THE ATMOSPHERE OF MY YEAR'S MISERY TO SURREY
SAY SO TO MY OWN CHILD VERRY TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SAID NO MORE BUT SHE HAD STARTED A LESS PLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IT WAS CHANGED AGAIN BY TEMPERANCE COMING WITH LIGHTS
THE GLUTTON BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE LONG THEY ARE ALL SO WHEN THEY FIRST COME SHE THEN GAVE HIM A LARGE SLICE OF THE CAKE VERONICA CONTRARY TO HER WONT
ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
JOE BACON MOTHER RETIRED VERRY STILL PLAYED HER TALENT IS WONDERFUL SAID FATHER TAKING THE CIGAR FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE WAY YOU MUST TAKE LESSONS IN MILFORD I WISH YOU WOULD LEARN TO SING
AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN ROSVILLE SHE WENT TO BOSTON THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON ANXIOUS TO GET SAFELY HOME WITH VERONICA WE PARTED WITH MANY A KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LAST WORDS
THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
EH VERRY SAID FATHER ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU GLAD TO SEE CASSY HOME AGAIN SHOULD I BE GLAD WHAT CAN SHE DO GRANDFATHER PURSED UP HIS MOUTH
ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SHADOW OF A CHANGE DURING THE REVIVAL AT BARMOUTH NO MORE THAN THE BABY HERE DID I SHALL HAVE FAITH THOUGH
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME I SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD WHITENED HE HELD A TASSELED CANE BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THUMPED THE FLOOR WHENEVER HE ASKED A QUESTION
THE BOY BY NAME CHARLES CAME TO SEE THE NEW ARRIVAL BUT SMITTEN WITH DIFFIDENCE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AND EXAMINED ME FROM HIS RETREAT
THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
HER HAIR DROPPED ON HER SHOULDER AND LOOKED LIKE A BROWN COILED SERPENT VERONICA WHO HAD BEEN SILENTLY OBSERVING HER ROSE FROM THE SOFA PICKED UP THE COMB AND FASTENED HER HAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING AS SHE PASSED SHE GAVE ME A DARK LOOK
I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
HER COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED MINE WAS IMPOSED UPON ME I REMONSTRATED WITH TEMPERANCE BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL WELL MEANT AND ALWAYS DONE
THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
I HAVE SET YOUR BEHAVIOR DOWN TO YOUR WILL YOU MAY BE RIGHT PERHAPS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT ME TOO SHE WAS AGAINST ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A TIMIDITY AND APPREHENSION THAT MADE MY HEART BLEED
THEY REITERATED THE CHARACTER THE PECULIARITIES THE VIRTUES OF THE MOTHER I HAD LOST WHO COULD NEVER BE REPLACED WHO WAS IN A BETTER WORLD HOWEVER I WAS IN A MEASURE
PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
VERONICA CAME IN FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A PLATE OF TOASTED CRACKERS SHE SET THE PLATE DOWN AND GRAVELY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME SAYING SHE HAD CONCLUDED TO LIVE ENTIRELY ON TOAST BUT SUPPOSED I WOULD EAT ALL SORTS OF FOOD AS USUAL
AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
AS I PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER ENTRY VERONICA OPENED HER DOOR SHE WAS UNDRESSED AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK IN HER HAND WHICH SHE SHOOK AT ME SAYING
A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
HER FACE WAS STILL LONG AND NARROW BUT PRETTIER AND HER LARGE DARK EYES HAD A SLIGHT CAST WHICH GAVE HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION DISTANT INDIFFERENT AND SPECULATIVE AS THE EYES WERE
TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
SO SHE SENT HIM OFF WITH TEMPERANCE AND CHARLES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO ROCK THE CRADLE AS LONG AS HIS BABYSHIP REQUIRED SOON AFTER FATHER CAME AND HEPSEY BROUGHT IN HIS HOT SUPPER WHILE HE WAS EATING IT GRANDFATHER JOHN MORGESON BUSTLED IN
AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TENDING AND WATCHING THEM THE OLDEST WAS EIGHT YEARS THE YOUNGEST THREE MONTHS COUSIN ALICE GAVE US DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR TASTES AND HABITS DWELLING WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE OF THE BABY
SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE YARD IS FULL OF CARRIAGES ALREADY SOMEBODY HANDED ME GLOVES MY BONNET WAS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF GIVEN TO ME AND THE DOOR OPENED IN THE PASSAGE I HEARD A KNOCKING FROM VERONICA'S ROOM AND CROSSED TO LEARN WHAT SHE WANTED
THOUGH THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT THE LAMPS WINKED BRIGHTLY AND FATHER MOVING HIS CIGAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CHANGED HIS REGARDS FROM ONE LAMP TO THE OTHER AND SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS GROWING TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL
SAID TEMPERANCE CALL HER WHEN SUPPER IS READY REPLIED MOTHER WHO ASKED ME TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM WHERE ARTHUR WAS SLEEPING HE WAS A HANDSOME CHILD LARGE AND FAIR AND AS I LIFTED HIS WHITE LAX FINGERS
KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
THOUGH THE TALL BRASS LAMPS GLITTERED LIKE GOLD THEIR CIRCLE OF LIGHT WAS SMALL THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WERE OBSCURE MISTER PARK ENTERING RETREATED INTO ONE AND MOTHER WAS OBLIGED TO FOREGO THE PLEASURE OF UNDRESSING ARTHUR
UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
WE SAT IN STATE TO BE CONDOLED WITH AND WAITED UPON
BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
IS IT BEST TO COOK MORE MISSUS MORGESON
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
PUTTING OTHERS OF A PLAINER MAKE IN THEIR PLACES SHOOK DOWN THE WINDOW CURTAINS ASKED US IF WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE AND QUIETLY DISAPPEARED I OFFERED MOTHER THE WARM WATER AND APPROPRIATED THE BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX I ATE EVERY ONE
I HEARD THE WONTED SOUND OF THE BANGING OF DOORS THE DOORS AT GRAND'THER'S I MUSED HAD LIST NAILED ROUND THEIR EDGES BUT THEN HE HAD THE LIST BEING A TAILOR I VUM SAID TEMPERANCE WITH HER HAND ON HER HIP
COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
LET IT NOT BE SO WITH US WAS HIS CONCLUSION HE THREW AWAY THE STUMP OF HIS CIGAR AND WENT TO FASTEN THE HALL DOOR I TOOK ONE OF THE BRASS LAMPS PROPOSING TO GO TO BED
I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
AND THE SCHOLARS SOME SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE COMING DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE HALL TO GO INTO THE ROOMS EACH SIDE OF A GREAT DOOR DOCTOR PRICE WAS BEHIND THEM HE STOPPED WHEN HE SAW US AN INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE AND HE INQUIRED FOR DOCTOR SNELL
FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
WHICH HE HAD IMPARTED TO HER OF AN ARCH IT MUST BE MADE OF BLACK MARBLE WITH GOLD VEINS AND OUGHT TO STAND IN EGYPT WITH THE WORD PANDEMONIUM ON IT THE KITCHEN WAS THE FOCUS OF INTEREST TO HIM
IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
TEMPERANCE BROUGHT ARTHUR TO THE TABLE HALF ASLEEP BUT HE ROUSED WHEN SHE DRUMMED ON HIS PLATE WITH A SPOON HEPSEY WAS STATIONED BY THE BANNOCK KNIFE IN HAND TO SERVE IT AS WE BEGAN OUR MEAL
I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
INSTEAD OF MY HEART LEAPING FOR JOY AS I HAD EXPECTED A SUDDEN INDIFFERENCE FILLED IT I FELT AVERSE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NARROW WAYS OF BARMOUTH WHICH FOR THE MOMENT I REGRETTED
SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
AND TURNED TOWARD MOTHER AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU UNDERSTAND BRINGING UP CHILDREN DON'T YOU SHE COMPREHENDED HIM AND GIVING HER HEAD A SLIGHT TOSS TOLD VERRY TO GO AND PLAY ON THE PIANO I WAS GOING SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
THAT STOOD ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS OFTEN AS THAT POSITION WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF GETTING ON FOR THEY EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE GUIDED BY A FIRM HAND EDWARD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR
AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE BLESSING OF SO GOOD A MAN AS YOUR GRAND'THER BUT I NEVER HEARD A WORD OF GRAND'THER'S PRAYERS DO YOU REMEMBER HIS VOICE
PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
AND MOTHER LISTENED WITH A VAGUE RESPECTFUL ATTENTION HER HAND WAS PRESSED AGAINST HER BREAST AS IF SHE WERE REPRESSING AN INWARD VOICE WHICH CLAIMED HER ATTENTION
AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER
WHO WERE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MOURNERS TO BE SHUT UP WITH US IT WAS PUT UNDER RIGOROUS FUNERAL LAW AND INSPECTED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THEY SUPERVISED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
PRESENTLY TEMPERANCE CAME IN WITH CHARLES BRINGING FRESH PLATES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER VERONICA ASKED TEMPERANCE HOW THE FISH TASTED IS IT SALT MIDDLING HOW IS THE BANNOCK EXCELLENT
I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
SHE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION TO FULFILL HER DUTIES THAT WAY
KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
WE LEFT THE CARRIAGE AT THE PALINGS AND WALKED UP THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE MOUNDS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS MARKED MORGESON SOME SO OLD THAT THEY WERE STAINED WITH BLOTCHES OF YELLOW MOSS
COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
A VERY STRONG RELATION OF RESERVE GENERALLY EXISTED BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL ONE AND THE CHILD WAS APT TO DISCOVER THAT RESERVE ON THE PART OF THE PARENT WAS NOT SUPERIORITY BUT COWARDICE OR INDIFFERENCE
AND DO YOU THINK MY OWN MAMMA WOULD LIKE IT IF MISS ALLISON CONSENTS TO TAKE A MOTHER'S PLACE TO YOU I AM SURE YOUR OWN MAMMA IF SHE COULD SPEAK TO YOU WOULD TELL YOU SHE DESERVED TO HAVE THE TITLE
EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL WARMLY AH WELL DEAR HE SAID IN A SOOTHING TONE WE WON'T TALK ANY MORE ABOUT IT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT FIND MISS STEVENS THE MOST AGREEABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD BUT I MUST TREAT HER
I AM SURE HE WOULD CONSENT FOR ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF YOU HE DOESN'T THINK OF IT WE CAN'T EXPECT GENTLEMEN TO NOTICE SUCH LITTLE MATTERS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A MAMMA TO ATTEND TO SUCH THINGS FOR YOU
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED BUT FOR THE COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND OF MISTER STEVENS WHO SAVED HIM ONLY BY VERY GREAT EXERTION AND AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS ELSIE WAS PLAYING ON THE VERANDA WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE GIRLS
AND I SHALL LOVE HER VERY DEARLY FOR I DO ALREADY BUT I CAN NOT LOVE ANYBODY QUITE SO WELL AS I LOVE YOU MY OWN DEAR DEAR FATHER SHE SAID THROWING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE RETURNED HER CARESS SAYING TENDERLY
AND ONCE OR TWICE PRESSING HIS LIPS GENTLY TO HER FOREHEAD YOU FEEL BETTER NOW DEAREST DO YOU NOT HE ASKED PRESENTLY AS SHE RAISED HER HEAD TO WIPE AWAY HER TEARS YES PAPA NOW TELL ME WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
BECAUSE I SAW HER NAME IN THE HOTEL BOOK LAST NIGHT WHEN I WENT TO REGISTER OURS AND IT JUST SPOILS ALL OUR PLEASURE I HOPE NOT DAUGHTER I THINK SHE WILL HARDLY ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE AT MY SIDE
SHE ISN'T IT'S FALSE MY BUT ELSIE CHECKED HERSELF AND SHUT HER TEETH HARD TO KEEP DOWN THE EMOTION THAT WAS SWELLING IN HER BREAST IT'S TRUE YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT REPLIED ANNIE EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE KNOWS IT AND THEY ARE ALL TALKING
SO CROSSLY ELSIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED BLUSHING AGAIN FOR HIS TONE WAS REPROVING COME HERE AND SIT ON MY KNEE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU I AM AFRAID MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS GROWING CENSORIOUS
WHICH WAS IN THE SECOND STORY AND OPENED UPON A VERANDA SHADED BY TALL TREES AND OVERLOOKING A LARGE GRASSY YARD AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BEYOND WERE GREEN FIELDS WOODS AND HILLS
ASSERTED ANNIE POSITIVELY FOR I HEARD MY MOTHER SAY SO ONLY YESTERDAY
THEN SHE WOULD PRESS ALL SORTS OF DAINTIES UPON THE LITTLE GIRL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DECLINE THEM AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS OR RATHER ALTERATIONS IN HER DRESS
GO INTO THE PARLOR OR TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN BY HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT MISS STEVENS WAS AT HER SIDE FAWNING UPON AND FLATTERING HER TELLING HER HOW SWEET AND PRETTY AND AMIABLE SHE WAS HOW DEARLY SHE LOVED HER
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE ENOUGH AND SOME OF YOUR WHITE DRESSES ARE BEAUTIFULLY WORKED BUT I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ORNAMENT YOU WEAR SO LITTLE JEWELRY AND YOUR FATHER COULD AFFORD TO COVER YOU WITH IT IF HE CHOSE
SHE WAS ABSENT BUT A FEW MOMENTS FROM THE PARLOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HER FATHER BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED TO IT HE WAS NOT THERE MISS ROSE TOO WAS GONE SHE FOUND UPON FURTHER SEARCH
AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT MUCH DIFFICULTY IN CONJECTURING WHY SHE HAD THUS FOR THE FIRST TIME BEEN LEFT BEHIND SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING RATHER LONELY AND DESOLATE SHE FELT NO DISPOSITION TO RENEW THE AFTERNOON'S CONVERSATION WITH ANNIE HART
HAD BEEN SECURED IN ADVANCE AND LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY HAD ARRIVED AND TAKEN POSSESSION IT WAS NOW EARLY IN THE MORNING
COME HERE AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT SHE OBEYED HANGING HER HEAD AND BLUSHING I THINK I HAVE SOME REASON TO BE CROSS PAPA SHE SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL TIME HERE
YOU KNOW I MEAN MISS STEVENS ELSIE ANSWERED IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE WELL DEAR AND WHAT OF IT ALL HE ASKED SOOTHINGLY I DON'T THINK THE SILLY NONSENSE OF THE SERVANTS NEED TROUBLE YOU JOHN IS A SAD FELLOW I KNOW
AND BESIDES YOU FORGET ABOUT THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE GIRL I HAVE HEARD LADIES SAY THEY WOULD NOT MARRY A MAN WHO HAD A CHILD BUT MISS ROSE LOVES ME PAPA
AND I WISH MY LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THOSE OLDER THAN HERSELF I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU THE OTHER DAY MENTION SOME GENTLEMAN'S NAME WITHOUT THE PREFIX OF MISTER AND I INTENDED TO REPROVE YOU FOR IT AT THE TIME DON'T DO IT AGAIN
I WOULD HAVE YOU TAKE FOR YOUR MODEL THE LESS YOU RESEMBLE HER IN DRESS MANNERS OR ANYTHING ELSE THE BETTER IF YOU WISH TO COPY ANY ONE LET IT BE MISS ALLISON FOR SHE IS A PERFECT LADY IN EVERY RESPECT
THAT WOULD ADD TO OUR HAPPINESS HE REPLIED GENTLY DEAR PAPA YOU WON'T BE ANGRY IF I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION NO DARLING ASK AS MANY AS YOU WISH THEN PAPA WILL I HAVE TO CALL HER MAMMA
WHY PAPA SURELY YOU KNOW I MEAN MISS STEVENS THEN WHY DID YOU NOT MENTION HER NAME INSTEAD OF SPEAKING OF HER AS SHE THAT DOES NOT SOUND RESPECTFUL IN A CHILD OF YOUR AGE
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PAPA WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST TOO BAD WHAT IS TOO BAD DAUGHTER I THINK I NEVER BEFORE SAW SO CROSS A LOOK ON MY LITTLE GIRL'S FACE HE SAID PEERING AT HER OVER THE TOP OF HIS NEWSPAPER
FOR WITH ALL HER JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF ROSE MINGLED A STRANGE SAD FEELING THAT SHE WAS GETTING FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT DEAR PRECIOUS UNKNOWN MOTHER WHOSE IMAGE HAD BEEN SINCE HER EARLIEST RECOLLECTION
AND BEFORE ROSE COULD RECOVER FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SUFFICIENTLY TO REPLY SHE HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE HALL DOOR ELSIE WAS OUT AGAIN IN A MOMENT JUST AS THE GENTLEMEN HAD JOINED ROSE
THEN DRAWING HER CLOSER TO HIM HE SAID TENDERLY MY POOR LITTLE GIRL I AM SORRY YOU SHOULD BE SO ANNOYED BUT YOU KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE DAUGHTER AND WHY NEED YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK AND SAY I DON'T LIKE THEM TO TALK SO PAPA
AND THAT MY CLOTHES SHALL BE OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND NICELY MADE BUT NEAT AND SIMPLE
LET US START TO MORROW PAPA CAN'T WE BUT YOU KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE MISS ROSE AH I FORGOT THAT SHE SAID A LITTLE SADLY BUT BRIGHTENING AGAIN SHE ASKED COULDN'T YOU INVITE HER TO GO HOME WITH US AND SPEND THE WINTER AH PAPA DO
AND NOW IT IS ALL SPOILED YOU COULD NEVER GUESS WHO HAS THE ROOMS JUST OPPOSITE OURS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL MISS STEVENS WHY PAPA DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS HERE I KNEW SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GOLD ONES TOO WITH CLASPS SET WITH DIAMONDS COULDN'T YOU PERSUADE YOUR PAPA TO BUY SOME FOR YOU INDEED MISS STEVENS I DON'T WANT THEM I DON'T WANT ANYTHING BUT WHAT PAPA CHOOSES TO BUY FOR ME OF HIS OWN ACCORD
AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME ISN'T IT YES PAPA AND I'LL STICK CLOSER THAN EVER TO YOU IF THAT WILL MAKE HER LET ME ALONE SHE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HIS NECK AND KISSING HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES
OH YES PAPA DO TAKE ME HOME SHE ANSWERED EAGERLY I WISH WE WERE THERE NOW I THINK IT IS THE PLEASANTEST PLACE IN THE WORLD AND IT SEEMS SUCH A LONG LONG WHILE SINCE WE CAME AWAY
MISS STEVENS HAD FROM THE FIRST CONCEIVED A GREAT ANTIPATHY TO ROSE WHOM SHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS RIVAL AND GENERALLY AVOIDED EXCEPTING WHEN MISTER DINSMORE WAS WITH HER BUT SHE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED A TETE A TETE
I THINK YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COMMAND TO BE COURTEOUS PAPA SHE SAID LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW YOU COULD BE SO VERY POLITE TO MISS STEVENS
I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO WALK AND I BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T FORBID ME I SHALL DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING YOU I HAVE JUST BEEN WAITING FOR PLEASANT COMPANY I WILL BE READY IN ONE MOMENT
AND IT FREQUENTLY COST HIM QUITE AN EFFORT TO TREAT MISS STEVENS WITH THE RESPECTFUL POLITENESS WHICH HE CONSIDERED DUE TO HER SEX AND TO THE DAUGHTER OF HIS FATHER'S OLD FRIEND WAS IT NOT TOO PROVOKING PAPA EXCLAIMED ELSIE
AND IT WOULD HURT US BOTH VERY MUCH IF YOU REFUSED TO GIVE IT INDEED MY DAUGHTER I CANNOT ASK HER TO COME TO US UNLESS YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO SO AND TO LOVE AND OBEY HER JUST AS YOU DO ME WILL YOU I WILL TRY TO OBEY HER PAPA
PAPA SAID ELSIE GAZING LONGINGLY UPON THEM AS SHE STOOD BY THE OPEN WINDOW CAN'T WE TAKE A WALK WHEN MISS ROSE IS READY TO GO WITH US MAY I RUN TO HER DOOR AND ASK IF SHE IS AND IF SHE ISN'T
THAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO BEAR THESE TRIFLING VEXATIONS WITH EQUANIMITY AND YOU MUST REMEMBER TOO DEAR THAT THE BIBLE BIDS US BE COURTEOUS AND TEACHES US TO TREAT OTHERS AS WE OURSELVES WOULD WISH TO BE TREATED
ELSIE LOOKED VERY MUCH PLEASED YES INDEED PAPA SHE SAID I SHOULD BE GLAD IF I COULD BE JUST LIKE MISS ROSE SHE IS ALWAYS KIND AND GENTLE TO EVERYBODY EVEN THE SERVANTS WHOM MISS STEVENS ORDERS ABOUT
AND AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HER CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIM AND KISSED HER TENDERLY AGAIN AND AGAIN SPEAK DAUGHTER AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WISH HE SAID AS SHE STILL REMAINED SILENT
SAID ROSE SMILING YOU DON'T WISH ANY SUCH THING ON THE CONTRARY YOU WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TO FLY TO THE RESCUE IF YOU SAW HER IN DANGER OF DROWNING BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME FOR ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID MISS STEVENS HAD RETURNED
AND I HEARD JOHN AND MISS STEVENS MAID PHILLIS TALKING TOGETHER IT WAS MOONLIGHT YOU KNOW PAPA SHE WENT ON TURNING HER FACE TOWARD HIM AGAIN AND THEY WERE OUT UNDER THE TREES AND JOHN HAD HIS ARM ROUND HER AND HE WAS KISSING HER
WOULD YOU LIKE IT DEAREST HE ASKED OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO GO ON LIVING JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN YOU AND I TOGETHER I WOULD CONSULT YOUR HAPPINESS BEFORE MY OWN FOR IT LIES VERY NEAR MY HEART MY PRECIOUS ONE
HE SAID WITH A VERY GRAVE LOOK AS HE DREW HER TO HIS SIDE YOU FORGET THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULTS I WILL TRY NOT TO DO IT ANY MORE PAPA SHE REPLIED THE TEARS SPRINGING TO HER EYES
IT WOULD BE SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HER NO MY DEAR IT WOULDN'T DO HE REPLIED WITH A GRAVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHY PAPA SHE ASKED WITH A LOOK OF KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAID IN THE SAME GRAVE TONE
MAY I WAIT FOR HER OUT HERE ON THE VERANDA YES
AND MUST TRY TO BEAR THEM WITH PATIENCE REMEMBERING THAT GOD SENDS THE LITTLE TRIALS AS WELL AS THE GREAT AND THAT HE HAS COMMANDED US TO LET PATIENCE HAVE HER PERFECT WORK I FEAR IT IS A LACK OF THE SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS
MISS STEVENS PRESENCE PROVED SCARCELY LESS ANNOYING TO ELSIE THAN THE CHILD HAD ANTICIPATED SHE TRIED TO KEEP OUT OF THE LADY'S WAY BUT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD SCARCELY STEP OUT ON THE VERANDA
SHE CRIED THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS BREAST AND BURSTING INTO A FIT OF PASSIONATE WEEPING MISTER DINSMORE SAID NOTHING FOR A MOMENT BUT THINKING TEARS WOULD PROVE THE BEST RELIEF TO HER OVERWROUGHT FEELINGS CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIMPLY STROKING HER HAIR IN A SOOTHING WAY
DO YOU THINK YOU SHALL LIKE YOUR NEW MAMMA ELSIE ASKED ONE OF THEM IN A CARELESS TONE AS SHE TIED ON AN APRON SHE HAD JUST BEEN MAKING FOR HER DOLL AND TURNED IT AROUND TO SEE HOW IT FITTED
AND NOW PRETENDS NOT TO APPROVE OF BALLS JUST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T ELSIE MADE NO REPLY BUT DROPPING SCISSORS PAPER AND EVERYTHING SPRANG UP AND RAN SWIFTLY ALONG THE VERANDA THROUGH THE HALL UPSTAIRS
FOR I WAS QUITE SURE YOU WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE HAD HER ALONG AND THEN WHAT RIGHT HAD SHE TO TAKE YOUR ARM WITHOUT BEING ASKED AND ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION HER FATHER LAUGHED A LITTLE AND THUS
ABOUT WHAT A SPLENDID MATCH MISS STEVENS IS GOING TO MAKE AND MAMMA WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW IT AND HOW YOU WOULD LIKE HER AND PAPA SAID HE THOUGHT MISTER DINSMORE WOULDN'T THINK MUCH OF HER IF HE KNEW HOW SHE FLIRTED AND DANCED UNTIL HE CAME
I CAN NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR ALL I HAVE MADE YOU SUFFER AND WHEN YOU WERE RESTORED TO ME ALMOST FROM THE GRAVE I MADE A VOW TO DO ALL IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOUR FUTURE LIFE BRIGHT AND HAPPY HIS TONES WERE FULL OF DEEP FEELING
EXCLAIMED ELSIE WITH UNFEIGNED ASTONISHMENT DROPPING THE SCISSORS WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN CUTTING PAPER DOLLS FOR SOME OF THE LITTLE ONES WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ANNIE
AH THERE IS MISS ROSE LOOKING FOR ME I MUST GO
MISTER DINSMORE AND ELSIE ROSE AND EDWARD ALLISON WERE OCCUPYING VERY COMFORTABLE QUARTERS IN A LARGE HOTEL AT ONE OF OUR FASHIONABLE WATERING PLACES A BEDROOM FOR EACH AND A PRIVATE PARLOR FOR THE JOINT USE OF THE PARTY
WHAT HAS SHE TO DO WITH MY PAPA'S AFFAIRS ASKED ELSIE INDIGNANTLY THE COLOR RUSHING OVER FACE NECK AND ARMS WELL I SHOULD THINK SHE MIGHT KNOW WHEN SHE IS GOING TO MARRY HIM RETURNED THE OTHER WITH A LAUGH
BUT DON'T SET YOUR HEART TOO MUCH ON IT FOR SHE MAY NOT BE QUITE SO WILLING TO TAKE SUCH A TROUBLESOME CHARGE AS MISS STEVENS SEEMS TO BE HE SAID RETURNING TO HIS PLAYFUL TONE ELSIE LOOKED TROUBLED AND ANXIOUS I HOPE SHE WILL PAPA
SHE DREW HER MOTHER'S MINIATURE FROM HER BOSOM AND FIXING HER EYES LOVINGLY UPON IT SAID AS SHE HAD DONE HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE NOW MAMMY PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT MY DEAR DEAR MAMMA THE SOFT EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS
NO SIR I WON'T ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A BLUSH BUT PAPA SHE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT MISS STEVENS DOES THAT CONSTANTLY THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE MY DAUGHTER HE SAID GRAVELY MISS STEVENS IS THE VERY LAST PERSON
HE ALWAYS BUYS MY DRESSES HIMSELF AND SAYS HOW THEY ARE TO BE MADE THE DRESSMAKER WANTED TO PUT MORE FLOUNCES ON BUT PAPA DIDN'T WANT THEM AND NEITHER DID I HE SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE LITTLE GIRLS LOADED WITH FINERY
AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
BETWEEN THEM WHEN IT WAS IN HER POWER TO DO SO WITHOUT BEING GUILTY OF VERY GREAT RUDENESS THIS AND THE COVERT SNEERS WITH WHICH SHE OFTEN ADDRESSED MISS ALLISON HAD NOT ESCAPED MISTER DINSMORE'S NOTICE
I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE THEM SAY SUCH THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY HE WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A LITTLE THEN SAID KINDLY I THINK I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THESE TROUBLESOME TALKERS
SHE SAID FLUSHING AND THE TEARS STARTING TO HER EYES YES DARLING I KNOW SHE DOES HE ANSWERED SOOTHINGLY I AM ONLY AFRAID SHE LOVES YOU BETTER THAN SHE DOES ME
I AM GLAD YOU ARE PLEASED WITH IT DAUGHTER RETURNED MISTER DINSMORE OPENING THE MORNING PAPER WHICH JOHN HAD JUST BROUGHT UP THEY
PLEASE DON'T TEASE ME SO
I HAVE BEEN NEAR TELLING HER SEVERAL TIMES THAT I DID WISH SHE WOULD LET ME ALONE NO DAUGHTER DON'T DO THAT YOU MUST BEHAVE IN A LADY LIKE MANNER WHETHER SHE DOES OR NOT
A LARGE PARTY OF EQUESTRIANS WERE SETTING OUT FROM THE HOTEL THAT EVENING SOON AFTER TEA AND ELSIE IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE GIRLS WENT OUT UPON THE VERANDA TO WATCH THEM MOUNT AND RIDE AWAY
AND THEN RELAPSED INTO SILENCE SITTING THERE FOR SOME TIME STROKING HER HAIR IN AN ABSENT WAY WITH HIS EYES ON THE CARPET AT LAST HE SAID ELSIE IN A SOFT LOW TONE THAT QUITE MADE THE LITTLE GIRL START AND LOOK UP INTO HIS FACE
SO SHE WENT QUIETLY UPSTAIRS TO THEIR PRIVATE PARLOR AND SAT DOWN TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH A BOOK UNTIL CHLOE CAME IN FROM EATING HER SUPPER THEN THE LITTLE GIRL BROUGHT A STOOL AND SEATING HERSELF IN THE OLD POSTURE WITH HER HEAD IN HER NURSE'S LAP
WHILE ELSIE ALMOST READY TO CRY WITH VEXATION FELL BEHIND WITH EDWARD ALLISON FOR AN ESCORT EDWARD TRIED TO ENTERTAIN HIS YOUNG COMPANION BUT WAS TOO MUCH PROVOKED AT THE TURN THINGS HAD TAKEN TO MAKE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE TO ANY ONE
HE COURTS ALL THE PRETTY COLORED GIRLS WHEREVER HE GOES I SHALL HAVE TO READ HIM A SERIOUS LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT BUT IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO BE SO CONCERNED FOR PHILLIS OH PAPA DON'T SHE SAID TURNING AWAY HER FACE
SHE SAID I THINK SHE MIGHT BE VERY GLAD TO COME AND LIVE WITH YOU AND IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME TOO AH BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT APPRECIATE MY SOCIETY AS HIGHLY AS YOU DO HE REPLIED LAUGHING AND PINCHING HER CHEEK
AND ALTOGETHER IT WAS QUITE AN UNCOMFORTABLE WALK NO ONE SEEMING TO ENJOY IT BUT MISS STEVENS WHO LAUGHED AND TALKED INCESSANTLY ADDRESSING NEARLY ALL HER CONVERSATION TO MISTER DINSMORE
AND I WILL TRY TO LIKE MISS STEVENS FOR THAT BUT WON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE BOTH QUITE YOUNG MEN SAID MISTER DINSMORE BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WAS MARRIED THEY WERE SKATING TOGETHER AND YOUR GRANDFATHER BROKE THROUGH THE ICE
FOR SHE TOO HAD BEEN IN A DEEP REVERIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED AND SHE WONDERED TO SEE HOW THE COLOR HAD SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AND HOW BRIGHT HIS EYES LOOKED I HAVE BEEN THINKING HE SAID IN A HALF HESITATING WAY
NO MISS STEVENS I THINK IT NEVER WAS HE REPLIED OFFERING THE OTHER ARM TO ROSE SHE WAS GOING TO DECLINE IT ON THE PLEA THAT THE PATH WAS TOO NARROW FOR THREE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND AND ACCEPT AND THEY MOVED ON
THAT IS ALL I CAN ASK DEAREST I MUST RESERVE THE FIRST PLACE IN YOUR HEART FOR MYSELF DO YOU THINK SHE WILL COME PAPA SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW DAUGHTER I HAVE NOT ASKED HER YET
AS SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THEIR RETURN FROM THEIR WALK WHAT MY DEAR WHY PAPA I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A NICE TIME AND SHE JUST SPOILED IT ALL SHE WHO DAUGHTER
WHO EXCITED THEIR SURPRISE AND DISGUST BY A REPETITION OF MISS STEVENS SPEECH TO HER MISTER DINSMORE LOOKED EXCESSIVELY ANNOYED AND EDWARD PSHAWED AND WISHED HER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA NO BROTHER
BLUSHING AND HANGING HER HEAD THEN HIDING HER FACE ON HIS BREAST SHE LAY THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES PERFECTLY SILENT AND STILL WHAT IS MY LITTLE GIRL THINKING OF HE ASKED AT LENGTH HOW EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT YOU PAPA LAST EVENING I WAS OUT ON THE VERANDA
A PAIR OF GOLD BRACELETS LIKE MINE FOR INSTANCE WOULD BE VERY PRETTY AND LOOK CHARMING ON YOUR LOVELY WHITE ARMS THOSE PEARL ONES YOU WEAR SOMETIMES ARE VERY HANDSOME ANY ONE COULD TELL THAT THEY ARE THE REAL THING
THANK YOU MA'AM I DARESAY YOU MEAN TO BE VERY KIND REPLIED ELSIE TRYING NOT TO LOOK ANNOYED BUT I DON'T WANT A MAMMA SINCE MY OWN DEAR MOTHER HAS GONE TO HEAVEN PAPA IS ENOUGH FOR ME AND I LIKE THE WAY HE DRESSES ME
AND WITHOUT PAUSING TO TAKE BREATH RUSHED INTO HER FATHER'S ROOM WHERE HE SAT QUIETLY READING WHY ELSIE DAUGHTER WHAT IS THE MATTER HE ASKED IN A TONE OF SURPRISE AND CONCERN AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER FLUSHED AND AGITATED FACE
AND HOW MUCH SHE THOUGHT OF HER PAPA TOO HE WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO GOOD EVERYBODY ADMIRED HIM AND THOUGHT HIM SUCH A FINE LOOKING GENTLEMAN SO POLISHED IN HIS MANNERS SO AGREEABLE
DEPRIVE MY LITTLE GIRL OF HER RIGHTS HE SAID SOFTLY KISSING THE GLOWING CHEEK AH I DOUBT IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY HAD IT BEEN MISS ROSE HE ADDED A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY
AH NOW I HAVE MY OWN LITTLE GIRL AGAIN HE SAID DRAWING HER TO HIS KNEE AND RETURNING HER CARESSES WITH INTEREST BUT THERE I HEAR MISS ROSE'S STEP IN THE HALL RUN TO MAMMY AND HAVE YOUR HAT PUT ON
POLITELY AND SHOW HER A LITTLE ATTENTION SOMETIMES BOTH BECAUSE SHE IS A LADY AND BECAUSE HER FATHER ONCE SAVED MY FATHER'S LIFE FOR WHICH I OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO HIM AND HIS CHILDREN DID HE PAPA I AM SURE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF HIM
AT LAST SHE SPOKE AND HE BENT DOWN TO CATCH THE WORDS DEAR PAPA SHE WHISPERED WOULD IT MAKE YOU HAPPY AND DO YOU THINK MAMMA KNOWS AND THAT SHE WOULD LIKE IT YOUR MAMMA LOVES US BOTH TOO WELL NOT TO BE PLEASED WITH ANYTHING
THAT THOUGH IT WOULD NOT DO TO INVITE MISS ROSE TO SPEND THE WINTER WITH US IT MIGHT DO VERY NICELY TO ASK HER TO COME AND LIVE AT THE OAKS ELSIE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH A BEWILDERED EXPRESSION THEN SUDDENLY COMPREHENDING HER FACE LIGHTED UP
BUT THAT ISN'T ALL AND THEN SHE REPEATED WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN ANNIE AND HERSELF HE LOOKED A GOOD DEAL PROVOKED AS SHE WENT ON WITH HER STORY THEN VERY GRAVE INDEED HE WAS QUITE SILENT FOR A MOMENT AFTER SHE HAD DONE
WHICH SHE SAID WAS ENTIRELY TOO PLAIN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MORE FLOUNCES ON YOUR SKIRTS MY DEAR SHE REMARKED ONE DAY SKIRT FLOUNCED TO THE WAIST ARE SO VERY PRETTY AND DRESSY
MISS STEVENS DOES SAY SUCH HATEFUL THINGS PAPA HE LAID HIS FINGER UPON HER LIPS DON'T USE THAT WORD AGAIN IT DOES NOT SOUND AT ALL LIKE MY USUALLY GENTLE SWEET TEMPERED LITTLE GIRL I WON'T PAPA SHE MURMURED
WHO HAD COME TO THE VERANDA WHERE SHE AND MISS STEVENS HAD BEEN STANDING TO TELL HER THAT THEY WERE GOING OUT TO WALK AND HER PAPA WISHED TO TAKE HER ALONG ELSIE WENT IN TO GET HER HAT AND MISS STEVENS CAME TOWARDS ROSE SAYING
AND TELLING HER HOW PRETTY SHE WAS AND THEN THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT MISS STEVENS AND YOU AND JOHN TOLD PHILLIS THAT HE RECKONED YOU WERE GOING TO MARRY HER WHO PHILLIS ASKED MISTER DINSMORE LOOKING EXCESSIVELY AMUSED
BUT SHALL I TELL HER THAT IT WILL ADD TO YOUR HAPPINESS IF SHE WILL BE YOUR MAMMA YES SIR AND THAT I WILL CALL HER MAMMA AND OBEY HER AND LOVE HER DEARLY OH PAPA ASK HER VERY SOON WON'T YOU PERHAPS
I NOTICED THAT MISTER GRIMSHAW'S HAND UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF PERHAPS RESTED LIGHTLY FROM TIME TO TIME ON WALLACE'S SUNNY HAIR THE EXAMINATION FINISHED MISTER GRIMSHAW LEANED ON THE DESK THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
THE INITIATION CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN FRED LANGDON'S BARN WHERE I WAS SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF TRIALS NOT CALCULATED TO SOOTHE THE NERVES OF A TIMOROUS BOY BEFORE BEING LED TO THE GROTTO OF ENCHANTMENT
SOME OCCULT ASSOCIATION BEING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN A CENT APIECE AND A CENTIPEDES SUSPENDED BY A STRING ROUND HIS NECK THE MEDALS WERE WORN NEXT THE SKIN AND IT WAS WHILE BATHING ONE DAY AT GRAVE POINT WITH JACK HARRIS AND FRED LANGDON
THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO TO A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT SAY NO IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE CARE YOU MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOURSELF WHY YOU SAY NO IT'S A PROOF OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE IF DONE FROM TRUE CHRISTIAN MOTIVES
BY THESE SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS MEASURES WE KEPT OUR TREASURY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION SOMETIMES HAVING ON HAND AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER I HAVE SAID THAT THE SOCIETY HAD NO SPECIAL OBJECT IT IS TRUE THERE WAS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING AMONG US
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
SUCH WAS THE MODEST TITLE GIVEN TO THE LOFT OVER MY FRIEND'S WOOD HOUSE MY HANDS WERE SECURELY PINIONED AND MY EYES COVERED WITH A THICK SILK HANDKERCHIEF AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS I WAS TOLD IN AN UNRECOGNIZABLE HUSKY VOICE
BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
A PROLONGED SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME NEXT
SURROUNDED BY TWELVE MASKED FIGURES FANTASTICALLY DRESSED ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS REALLY APPALLING WITH A TIN SAUCE PAN ON HIS HEAD AND A TIGER SKIN SLEIGH ROBE THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS I SCARCELY NEED SAY
AND PUT BACK MY HAIR THIS LAST CONDITION WAS RATHER A STAGGERER I SHA'N'T DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONWAY SULKILY THEN THE THING MUST GO ON SAID ADAMS WITH DIGNITY
AND SCOWLED IN THE MOST THREATENING WAY OVER HIS SUMS CONWAY HAD AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PECULIARLY HIS OWN THAT OF THROWING HIS THUMBS OUT OF JOINT AT WILL SOMETIMES WHILE ABSORBED IN STUDY OR ON BECOMING NERVOUS AT RECITATION
HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
RODGERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR SECOND CONWAY BAILEY COME HERE WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT HE WAS THRASHING BINNY WALLACE NO I WASN'T INTERRUPTED CONWAY
BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
TO MYSTIFY THE STAID AND SLOW GOING RIVERMOUTHIANS WAS OUR FREQUENT PLEASURE SEVERAL OF OUR PRANKS WON US SUCH A REPUTATION AMONG THE TOWNSFOLK THAT WE WERE CREDITED WITH HAVING A LARGE FINGER IN WHATEVER WENT AMISS IN THE PLACE ONE MORNING
I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
MUTTERED PHIL TWITCHING THE HANDKERCHIEF TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WERE SECURELY TIED HE THEN LOOSENED MY GALLOWSES BRACES AND BUCKLED THEM TIGHTLY ABOVE MY HIPS NOW THEN BANTAM NEVER SAY DIE
WERE OF A NATURE NOT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND WERE NOT MISUNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE BUT MISTER MEEKS HIMSELF THE WIDOW CARRIED ON A DRESS MAKING ESTABLISHMENT AT HER RESIDENCE ON THE CORNER OPPOSITE MEEKS'S DRUG STORE
EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
IF HE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TERROR HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE TRICKED UNMERCIFULLY ONE OF OUR SUBSEQUENT DEVICES A HUMBLE INVENTION OF MY OWN WAS TO REQUEST THE BLINDFOLDED CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT HIS TONGUE WHEREUPON THE FIRST CENTIPEDE WOULD SAY
THE MYSTIC TWELVE REVOLVED ABOUT ME THIS CONCLUDED THE CEREMONY WITH A MERRY SHOUT THE BOYS THREW OFF THEIR MASKS AND I WAS DECLARED A REGULARLY INSTALLED MEMBER OF THE R M C
A SECOND PISTOL SHOT WAS HEARD THE SOMETHING I STOOD ON SUNK WITH A CRASH BENEATH MY FEET AND I FELL TWO MILES AS NEARLY AS I COULD COMPUTE IT AT THE SAME INSTANT THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS WHISKED FROM MY EYES AND I FOUND MYSELF STANDING IN AN EMPTY HOGSHEAD
BUT THEY WERE NOT THE TEARS OF DEFEAT THEY WERE MERELY THE INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE WHICH NATURE PAID TO THE DEPARTED TRESSES IN A SECOND MY LITTLE JACKET LAY ON THE GROUND AND I STOOD ON GUARD RESTING LIGHTLY ON MY RIGHT LEG
THAT THERE WERE NO VESTIGES TO BE SEEN OF THE FEARFUL GULFS OVER WHICH I HAD PASSED SO CAUTIOUSLY MY ASCENT HAD BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE HOGSHEAD AND MY DESCENT TO THE BOTTOM THEREOF HOLDING ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND AND CHANTING A LOW DIRGE
CHAPTER TEN I FIGHT CONWAY THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER WHO CHERISHED A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE CENTIPEDES HAD HAD A HAND IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT PERSON WAS CONWAY
WAS RECOGNIZED AT ONCE IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE OVER THE TOWN AND THOUGH THE MORTAR AND THE PLACARD WERE SPEEDILY REMOVED OUR TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS ON THE BROAD GRIN AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR SEEMINGLY UNSUSPECTED
I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
THE LADY'S FONDNESS AND THE GENTLEMAN'S BLINDNESS WERE TOPICS ABLY HANDLED AT EVERY SEWING CIRCLE IN THE TOWN IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO LUCKLESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WE PROPOSED TO STRIKE A BLOW AT THE COMMON ENEMY
I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
IT WAS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE WIDOW CONWAY HAD NOT BURIED HER HEART WITH THE LATE LAMENTED AS TO HER SHYNESS THAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR INDEED HER ATTENTIONS TO MISTER MEEKS WHOSE MOTHER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
IN A LOW TONE AS IF NOT INTENDED FOR THE EAR OF THE VICTIM DIABOLUS FETCH ME THE RED HOT IRON THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH THAT TONGUE WOULD DISAPPEAR WAS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS
FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
THEY'LL BE HANDY TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE SAYS MISS ABIGAIL GRIMLY OF COURSE SO GREAT A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE WAS NOT TO BE PASSED OVER BY MISTER GRIMSHAW
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS THE ORDERLY CITIZENS WENDED THEIR WAY TO CHURCH PAST THE WIDOW'S ABODE THEIR SOBER FACES RELAXED AT BEHOLDING OVER HER FRONT DOOR THE WELL KNOWN GILT MORTAR AND PESTLE WHICH USUALLY STOOD ON THE TOP OF A POLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER
IN THE COURSE OF TEN DAYS I RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY FROM MY INJURIES TO ATTEND SCHOOL WHERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WAS LOOKED UPON AS A HERO ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING BEEN BLOWN UP WHAT DON'T WE MAKE A HERO OF
IN AUGUST WE HAD TWO WEEKS VACATION IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE RIVERMOUTH CENTIPEDES A SECRET SOCIETY COMPOSED OF TWELVE OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS
CASTING DESTRUCTIVE GLANCES ACROSS THE STREET THE ARTIFICIAL ROSES IN HER CAP AND HER WHOLE LANGUISHING MANNER SAYING AS PLAINLY AS A LABEL ON A PRESCRIPTION TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT MISTER MEEKS DIDN'T TAKE
TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTRAGED LAWS CHARLEY MARDEN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN A PILE OF GRAVEL BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND LOOKED LIKE A RECENTLY EXHUMED MUMMY THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST EVIDENCE AGAINST US AND INDEED WE WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT OF THE OFFENCE
THERE WAS A CERTAIN SLIM MILD APOTHECARY IN THE TOWN BY THE NAME OF MEEKS IT WAS GENERALLY GIVEN OUT THAT MISTER MEEKS HAD A VAGUE DESIRE TO GET MARRIED BUT BEING A SHY AND TIMOROUS YOUTH LACKED THE MORAL COURAGE TO DO SO
WE CLASPED HANDS IN THE TAMEST MANNER IMAGINABLE AND CONWAY MUMBLED I'M SORRY I FOUGHT WITH YOU I THINK YOU ARE I REPLIED DRILY AND I'M SORRY I HAD TO THRASH YOU
I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
YOU'LL GET NO DESCRIPTION OF IT FROM ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PROVE VERY POOR READING AND NOT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY REVOLT AGAINST CONWAY'S TYRANNY UNJUSTIFIABLE I HAD BORNE CONWAY'S PERSECUTIONS FOR MANY MONTHS WITH LAMB LIKE PATIENCE
TO KILL LESS THAN THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE DID NOT SUIT OUR SANGUINARY PURPOSE WE DISLIKED THE WIDOW NOT SO MUCH FOR HER SENTIMENTALITY AS FOR BEING THE MOTHER OF BILL CONWAY WE DISLIKED MISTER MEEKS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS INSIPID
BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
THE GENTLE SOUL HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE FENCE SUFFERING UNTOLD AGONY
I HAVE NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT MY MOVEMENTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY DISMAL GROANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GROTTO FINALLY I WAS LED UP A STEEP PLANK TO WHAT APPEARED TO ME AN INCALCULABLE HEIGHT
AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
WHEN THE CAPTAIN DRAGGED ME IGNOMINIOUSLY FROM THE HAYMOW AND CONDUCTED ME MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE TO THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE CLAPHAM HERE I ENCOUNTERED FIVE OTHER PALLID CULPRITS WHO HAD BEEN FISHED OUT OF DIVERS COAL BINS GARRETS AND CHICKEN COOPS
IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
FIGHT IT OUT AND DON'T GIVE IN WHILE YOU CAN STAND AND SEE AND DON'T GIVE IN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE FOR I COULD STAND VERY LITTLE AND SEE NOT AT ALL HAVING POMMELLED THE SCHOOL PUMP FOR THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS
BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
IT WAS A CUSTOM WITH THE LARGER PUPILS TO RETURN TO THE PLAYGROUND AFTER SCHOOL AND PLAY BASEBALL UNTIL SUNDOWN THE TOWN AUTHORITIES HAD PROHIBITED BALL PLAYING ON THE SQUARE AND THERE BEING NO OTHER AVAILABLE PLACE
AND ON STEPPING INTO THE PLAYGROUND SAW MY LITTLE FRIEND PLASTERED AS IT WERE UP AGAINST THE FENCE AND CONWAY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM READY TO DELIVER A BLOW ON THE UPTURNED UNPROTECTED FACE WHOSE GENTLENESS WOULD HAVE STAYED ANY ARM BUT A COWARD'S
MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
I AFTERWARDS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF SPORT OUT OF THE CLUB FOR THESE INITIATIONS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE WERE SOMETIMES VERY COMICAL SPECTACLES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ASPIRANT FOR CENTIPEDAL HONORS HAPPENED TO BE OF A TIMID DISPOSITION
IF I FELT MYSELF PHYSICALLY TOO WEAK TO UNDERGO THE NECESSARY TORTURES I REPLIED THAT I WAS NOT TOO WEAK IN A TONE WHICH I INTENDED TO BE RESOLUTE BUT WHICH IN SPITE OF ME SEEMED TO COME FROM THE PIT OF MY STOMACH IT IS WELL
CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
THE DISTRACTION WHICH PREVAILED IN THE CLASSES THE WEEK PRECEDING THE FOURTH HAD SUBSIDED AND NOTHING REMAINED TO INDICATE THE RECENT FESTIVITIES EXCEPTING A NOTICEABLE WANT OF EYEBROWS ON THE PART OF PEPPER WHITCOMB AND MYSELF
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER MY ADMISSION INTO THE SECRET ORDER THE QUIET CITIZENS AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE SIGNBOARDS OF ALL THE PRINCIPAL STREETS HAD CHANGED PLACES DURING THE NIGHT PEOPLE WHO WENT TRUSTFULLY TO SLEEP IN CURRANT SQUARE OPENED THEIR EYES IN HONEYSUCKLE TERRACE
IS IT A FIGHT ASKED PHIL ADAMS WHO SAW BY OUR FRESHNESS THAT WE HAD NOT YET GOT TO WORK YES IT'S A FIGHT I ANSWERED UNLESS CONWAY WILL ASK WALLACE'S PARDON PROMISE NEVER TO HECTOR ME IN FUTURE
YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
LIKE HIS OWN SYRUPS BUT BECAUSE THE WIDOW LOVED HIM BILL CONWAY WE HATED FOR HIMSELF LATE ONE DARK SATURDAY NIGHT IN SEPTEMBER WE CARRIED OUR PLAN INTO EFFECT
SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
YOUNG BAILEY AND HIS FIVE CRONIES COULD TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THEM SIGNS WHEN HE WAS CALLED UPON TO MAKE GOOD HIS ASSERTION HE WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE TERRIFIED THAN THE CENTIPEDES THOUGH THEY WERE READY TO SINK INTO THEIR SHOES AT OUR NEXT MEETING
IF YOU HAD ADVANCED ANOTHER INCH YOU WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED DOWN AN ABYSS THREE THOUSAND FEET DEEP I NATURALLY SHRUNK BACK AT THIS FRIENDLY PIECE OF INFORMATION A PRICK FROM SOME TWO PRONGED INSTRUMENT EVIDENTLY A PITCHFORK
THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
COOL IS THE WORD SAID ADAMS AS HE BOUND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY HEAD AND CAREFULLY TUCKED AWAY THE LONG STRAGGLING LOCKS THAT OFFERED A TEMPTING ADVANTAGE TO THE ENEMY WHO EVER HEARD OF A FELLOW WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR GOING INTO ACTION
THIS WAS AN HONOR TO WHICH I HAD LONG ASPIRED BUT BEING A NEW BOY I WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE FRATERNITY UNTIL MY CHARACTER HAD FULLY DEVELOPED ITSELF IT WAS A VERY SELECT SOCIETY THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NEVER FATHOMED
IS YOUR MAN READY ASKED PHIL ADAMS ADDRESSING RODGERS READY KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE GATE TOM
THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
AND NOW HE HAD CAUSED US TO BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPHAM ON A CHARGE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS AND PAINFUL AFTER MUCH NOISY DISCUSSION A PLAN OF RETALIATION WAS AGREED UPON
HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
AND SIX OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS WERE SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPBAM HAVING TEARFULLY DISCLAIMED TO MY GRANDFATHER ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRANSACTION I DISAPPEARED FROM THE FAMILY CIRCLE AND WAS NOT APPREHENDED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
HE PERFORMED THE FEAT UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE MORNING HIS THUMBS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISLOCATION INDICATING GREAT MENTAL AGITATION ON THE PART OF THE OWNER WE FULLY EXPECTED AN OUTBREAK FROM HIM AT RECESS
GENTLY CHECKED MY RETREAT I WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO THE BRINK OF SEVERAL OTHER PRECIPICES AND ORDERED TO STEP OVER MANY DANGEROUS CHASMS WHERE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEATH IF I HAD COMMITTED THE LEAST MISTAKE
THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
THAT THE CENTIPEDES WERE TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ON ALL OCCASIONS THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY DID BUT FURTHER THAN THIS WE HAD NO PURPOSE UNLESS IT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH AS A BODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MISCHIEF WHICH WE WERE SURE TO DO AS INDIVIDUALS
THE TRICK AS WAS AFTERWARDS PROVED HAD BEEN PLAYED BY A PARTY OF SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE FORT IN THE HARBOR WE WERE INDEBTED FOR OUR ARREST TO MASTER CONWAY WHO HAD SLYLY DROPPED A HINT WITHIN THE HEARING OF SELECTMAN MUDGE TO THE EFFECT THAT
THOUGH I WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE BODY DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY RESIDENCE AT RIVERMOUTH AND AT ONE TIME HELD THE ONEROUS POSITION OF F C FIRST CENTIPEDE EACH OF THE ELECT WORE A COPPER CENT
WHENEVER A MEMBER HAD REASONS FOR THINKING THAT ANOTHER MEMBER WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND HE CALLED A MEETING FOR INSTANCE IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THE DEATH OF HARRY BLAKE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER I ISSUED A CALL
THAT I HAD MY CURIOSITY ROUSED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH BY A SIGHT OF THESE SINGULAR EMBLEMS AS SOON AS I ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF A BOYS CLUB OF COURSE I WAS READY TO DIE TO JOIN IT AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN
OUR MEETINGS WERE HELD IN VARIOUS BARNS AT NO STATED PERIODS BUT AS CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED ANY MEMBER HAD A RIGHT TO CALL A MEETING EACH BOY WHO FAILED TO REPORT HIMSELF WAS FINED ONE CENT
ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT CONWAY'S ANIMOSITY SHOULD NOT BE QUIETLY SUBMITTED TO HE HAD SOUGHT TO INFORM AGAINST US IN THE STAGECOACH BUSINESS HE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY PETTINGIL'S LITTLE BILL FOR TWENTY FOUR ICECREAMS TO CHARLEY MARDEN'S FATHER
JONES'S AVENUE AT THE NORTH END HAD SUDDENLY BECOME WALNUT STREET AND PEANUT STREET WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND CONFUSION REIGNED THE TOWN AUTHORITIES TOOK THE MATTER IN HAND WITHOUT DELAY
THE WOMAN WAS PLEADING WITH THEM TO LET HIM GO HE WAS ONLY A HARMLESS LAD AND WHILE THESE WERE DARK DAYS A CRIME COMMITTED NOW MIGHT YET BE PUNISHED A HARMLESS BOY SAID THE STRANGE MAN HE'S QUICK AN STRONG ENOUGH I TELL YOU
DICK AND MANY OF THOSE AROUND HIM SANK EXHAUSTED UPON THE GROUND EVEN HAD THEY BEEN ORDERED TO FOLLOW THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCAPABLE OF IT COMPLETE NERVOUS COLLAPSE FOLLOWED SUCH DAYS AND NIGHTS AS THOSE THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED NOR DID GRANT AND BUELL WISH TO PURSUE
THE MAN SHARPLY BADE THE DOGS BE SILENT AND THEY RETREATED BEHIND THE HOUSE THEIR TAILS DROOPING THEN HE SAID TO DICK IN A TONE THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT HOSPITALITY LIGHT STRANGER AN WE'LL PUT UP YOUR HORSE MANDY WILL HAVE SUPPER READY BY THE TIME WE FINISH THE JOB
ONCE MORE THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH IN THE WOODS LOOKED DOWN UPON ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY CONFLICTS OF THE WHOLE WAR IF SHERMAN COULD BREAK THROUGH THE SOUTHERN LINE HERE BEAUREGARD'S WHOLE ARMY WOULD BE LOST BUT THE SOUTHERN SOLDIERS WERE CAPABLE OF ANOTHER AND A MIGHTY EFFORT
BEAUREGARD AT DAWN WOULD HAVE TO FACE TWICE HIS NUMBERS AT LEAST HALF OF WHOM WERE FRESH TROOPS ANOTHER CONFERENCE WAS HELD BY THE SOUTHERN GENERALS IN THE FOREST BUT NOW THE CENTRAL FIGURE THE GREAT JOHNSTON WAS GONE
DICK WHO HAD BEEN LYING UNDER COVER JUST BEHIND THE CREST OF ONE OF THE LOW RIDGES SUDDENLY HEARD THE LOUD BEATING OF HIS HEART HE DID NOT KNOW FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THAT THE SOUND CAME SO DISTINCTLY BECAUSE THE MIGHTY TUMULT WHICH HAD BEEN RAGING AROUND HIM ALL DAY HAD CEASED
IF YOU WERE TO HIT ME IN THE STOMACH I'D GIVE BACK A HOLLOW SOUND LIKE A DRUM WHY DON'T SOMEBODY RING THE SUPPER BELL BUT FIRES WERE SOON LIGHTED ALONG THEIR WHOLE FRONT AND PROVISIONS WERE BROUGHT UP FROM THE REAR AND FROM THE STEAMERS THE SOLDIERS FEELING THEIR STRENGTH RETURNING ATE RAVENOUSLY
IN A GREAT FIREPLACE TEN FEET WIDE BIG LOGS ROARED AND CRACKLED CORN CAKES VEGETABLES AND TWO KINDS OF MEAT WERE COOKING OVER THE COALS AND A GREAT POT OF COFFEE BOILED AND BUBBLED NO CANDLES HAD BEEN LIGHTED BUT THEY WERE NOT NEEDED THE FLAMES GAVE SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION SET YOUNG MAN
I'VE BEEN IN THE MOUNTAINS LOOKING AFTER SOME LAND THAT BELONGS TO MY FAMILY SAID DICK MY NAME IS MASON RICHARD MASON AND I LIVE NEAR PENDLETON WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE HE DEEMED IT BEST TO GIVE HIS RIGHT NAME AS IT WOULD HAVE NO SIGNIFICANCE THERE
WHILE THE SHATTERED REMNANTS OF THE ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE WERE RESTING THE FRESH ARMY OF THE OHIO WAS MARCHING BY IT IN THE LATE HOURS OF THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO FACE THE SOUTHERN FOE IN THE MORNING THE SOUTHERN ARMY ITSELF LAY DEEP IN THE WOODS FROM WHICH IT HAD DRIVEN ITS ENEMY
THEIR PULSES BECAME STRONGER AND THE BLOOD FLOWED IN A QUICKENED TORRENT THROUGH THEIR VEINS THEY LET IT POUR UPON THEM MERELY SEEKING TO KEEP THEIR AMMUNITION DRY TEN THOUSAND WOUNDED WERE YET LYING UNTOUCHED IN THE FOREST BUT THE RAIN WAS GRATEFUL TO THEM TOO
IN FACT YOU SEE MANY WHO ARE NOT OLDER THAN FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN HE HAD SPOKEN HASTILY AND INCAUTIOUSLY AND HE REALIZED IT AT ONCE THE MAN'S KEEN GAZE WAS TURNED UPON HIM AGAIN YOU'VE SEEN THE ARMIES THEN HE SAID MEBBE YOU'RE A SOJER YOURSELF
AND CUT OFF AN ICY BLAST IT'LL MAKE THE FIRE AN SUPPER ALL THE BETTER WE'RE JUST PLAIN MOUNTAIN PEOPLE BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO THE BEST WE HAVE MA THIS IS MISTER MASON WHO HAS BEEN ON LAN BUSINESS IN THE MOUNTAINS AN IS BACK ON HIS WAY TO HIS HOME AT PENDLETON
NOT YET REALIZING TO THE FULL THAT THE TUMULT OF THE BATTLE HAD CEASED THE BOY FELT STIFF AND SORE IN EVERY BONE AND MUSCLE AND ALTHOUGH THE CANNON AND RIFLES WERE SILENT THERE WAS STILL A HOLLOW ROARING IN HIS EARS HIS EYES WERE YET DIM FROM THE SMOKE AND HIS HEAD FELT HEAVY AND DULL
BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY BIG VICTORY LOOK THERE'S GENERAL GRANT HIMSELF GRANT WAS PASSING ALONG HIS WHOLE LINE WHILE LEAVING THE MAIN BATTLE TO BUELL HE RETAINED GENERAL COMMAND AND WATCHED EVERYTHING
DICK SURMISED THAT THIS BED WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO HIM THEIR APPETITES GREW LAX AND FINALLY CEASED THEN LEFFINGWELL YAWNED AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS STRANGER HE SAID WE RISE EARLY AN GO TO BED EARLY IN THESE PARTS
DESPITE THE LANGUOR PRODUCED BY FOOD AND HEAT A CERTAIN NERVOUS APPREHENSION HAD BEEN AT WORK IN THE BOY'S MIND AND IT FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE UNKNOWN REGIONS OF SLEEP HIS BODY WAS DEAD FOR A TIME AND HIS MIND TOO BUT THIS NERVOUS POWER WORKED ON ALMOST INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM
A TREMENDOUS SHOUT OF EXULTATION SWEPT THROUGH THE NORTHERN RANKS AS THEY FELT THEMSELVES ADVANCING THE PROMISES OF THEIR GENERALS WERE COMING TRUE AND THERE IS NOTHING SWEETER THAN VICTORY AFTER DEFEAT FORTUNE AFTER FROWNING UPON HER SO LONG WAS NOW SMILING UPON THE NORTH
NO DICK MY BOY NONE FOR THE PRESENT REPLIED THE COLONEL A LITTLE SADLY HALF OF MY POOR REGIMENT IS KILLED OR WOUNDED AND THE REST ARE SO EXHAUSTED THAT THEY ARE BARELY ABLE TO MOVE BUT THEY FOUGHT MAGNIFICENTLY DICK THEY HAD TO OR BE CRUSHED
PERHAPS HE HAD NOT BEEN ASLEEP MORE THAN AN HOUR AND IT WAS NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD LIE AWAKE A WHILE TALKING ABOUT THE COMING OF THIS YOUNG STRANGER OR ANY OTHER EVENT OF THE DAY THAT INTERESTED THEM THEN HE CAUGHT A TONE OR AN INFLECTION THAT HE DID NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN USED BY EITHER OF THE LEFFINGWELLS
THERE WAS A SMALL WINDOW NEAR THE FOOT OF THE ROOM AND WHEN HE NOTICED IT HE RESOLVED TO LET IN A LITTLE AIR LATER ON THE MOUNTAINEERS LIKED HOT ROOMS ALL THE TIME BUT HE DID NOT THIS WINDOW CONTAINED NO GLASS BUT WAS CLOSED WITH A BROAD SHUTTER
HE TOO OBSERVED THE FAILURE OF BUELL'S ARMY TO DRIVE THE ENEMY BEFORE THEM AND HE MUST HAVE FELT A SINKING OF THE HEART BUT HE DID NOT SHOW IT INSTEAD HE SPOKE ONLY OF VICTORY WHEN HE MADE ANY COMMENT AT ALL AND SENT THE MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF TO MAKE NEW ARRANGEMENTS
DICK RODE CLOSE TO THE DOOR AND WITHOUT HESITATION ASKED FOR A NIGHT'S SHELTER AND FOOD THIS WAS HIS INALIENABLE RIGHT IN THE HILLS OR MOUNTAINS OF HIS STATE AND HE WOULD BE A STRANGE MAN INDEED WHO WOULD REFUSE IT
NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET EM AN GET THE FULL WORTH OF EM FROM THEM TO WHOM THEY'RE WORTH THE MOST HE'S GOT A PISTOL SAID THE ELDER LEFFINGWELL
WHEN THEY COULD THEY TURNED THEIR FEVERED FACES UP TO IT THAT IT MIGHT BEAT UPON THEM AND BRING GRATEFUL COOLNESS DEEP IN THE NIGHT A COUNCIL LIKE THAT OF THE SOUTHERN GENERALS WAS HELD IN THE NORTHERN CAMP ALSO GRANT HIS FACE AN EXPRESSIONLESS MASK PRESIDED AND SAID BUT LITTLE
A MAN ELDERLY BUT DARK AND STRONG WITH THE HIGH CHEEK BONES OF AN INDIAN STOOD IN THE DOOR THE LIGHT OF A FIRE BLAZING IN THE FIREPLACE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WALL THROWING HIM IN RELIEF HIS HAIR WAS COAL BLACK LONG AND COARSE INCREASING HIS RESEMBLANCE TO AN INDIAN
THEY GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR SHATTERED BRIGADES AND HURLED THEM LIKE A THUNDERBOLT UPON THE UNION LEFT AND CENTER THE SHOCK WAS TERRIFIC SHERMAN WITH ALL HIS STAUNCHNESS AND THE VALOR OF HIS MEN WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE WAY MC CLERNAND TOO REELED BACK OTHERS WERE DRIVEN IN ALSO
IT SEEMS THAT WE DO NOT MAKE HEADWAY SIR HE SAID TO COLONEL WINCHESTER WHO ALSO STOOD BY HIM LOOKING AND LISTENING NOT THAT I CAN PERCEIVE REPLIED THE COLONEL AND YET WITH THE RUSH OF FORTY THOUSAND FRESH TROOPS OF OURS UPON THE FIELD I DEEMED VICTORY QUICK AND EASY
HE MURMURED HIS EXCUSES AND SAID HE BELIEVED HE WOULD LIKE TO RETIRE DON'T YOU BE BASHFUL ABOUT SAYIN SO EXCLAIMED LEFFINGWELL HEARTILY
SENT HUGE SHELLS CURVING INTO THE FOREST TOWARD THE CAMP OF THE SOUTHERN ARMY HE ALSO SAW NEAR HIM WARNER AND PENNINGTON SOUND ASLEEP ON THE GROUND AND THEN HE SANK BACK INTO HIS OWN LETHARGIC SLUMBER
THE ENTIRE ARMY OF THE OHIO LED BY GENERAL BUELL IN PERSON WILL BE IN POSITION THEN OR VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARD AND A NEW AND WE HOPE A VERY DIFFERENT BATTLE WILL BEGIN FOOD AND COFFEE WERE SERVED TO THE MEN AND WHILE THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THEY FORMED IN LINE AND AWAITED THE DAWN
AND THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO BATTLE THE SOUND WAS THUNDER ROLLING HEAVILY ON THE SOUTHERN HORIZON AND THE NIGHT HAD BECOME VERY DARK VIVID FLASHES OF LIGHTNING CUT THE SKY AND A STRONG WIND RUSHED AMONG THE TREES
BUT IN A FEW SECONDS HE RECOVERED HIMSELF AND LOOKED RATHER ASHAMED BOYS HE SAID I APOLOGIZE YOU NEEDN'T SAID PENNINGTON
I HAD A NUMBER OF LOOKS AT IT REPLIED WARNER AND I SHOULD SAY FROM THE WAY IT ACTED THAT IT NUMBERED AT LEAST THREE MILLION MEN I KNOW THAT AT TIMES NOT LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND WERE AIMING THEIR RIFLES AT MY OWN POOR AND UNWORTHY PERSON WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY FOR SO MANY MEN TO SHOOT AT ME ALL AT ONCE
DICK FROM A HIGH POINT ON WHICH HE LAY SAW THE DARK SURFACE OF THE TENNESSEE AND THE LIGHTS ON THE PUFFING STEAMERS AS THEY CROSSED BEARING THE ARMY OF THE OHIO HIS MIND DID NOT WORK ACTIVELY NOW BUT HE FELT THAT THEY WERE SAVED
THE MAN KERINS LAUGHED HE'LL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO SHOOT HE SAID WHY AFTER ALL HE WENT THROUGH TODAY HE'LL SLEEP LIKE A LOG TILL MORNIN THAT'S SO SAID ONE OF THE YOUNG LEFFINGWELLS AN KERINS IS RIGHT WE OUGHT TO GRAB THEM DISPATCHES
THOUGH HAVING PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOR MUST FIGHT TO SAVE HERSELF HE FELT THAT THE RESISTANCE IN FRONT OF THEM WAS NO LONGER INVINCIBLE HE SAW IN THE FLASH OF THE FIRING THAT THE SOUTHERN RANKS WERE THIN VERY THIN AND HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO BREAK IN THEIR OWN ADVANCE
DICK NOT HAVING SLEPT ANY THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAVING PASSED THROUGH A DAY OF FIERCE BATTLE WAS OVERCOME AFTER MIDNIGHT AND SANK INTO A SLEEP THAT WAS MERE LETHARGY HE AWOKE ONCE BEFORE DAWN AND REMEMBERED BUT VAGUELY ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED YET HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THERE WAS MUCH MOVEMENT IN THE FOREST
BY THAT TIME NIGHT HAD COME FULLY THOUGH FORTUNATELY IT WAS CLEAR BUT VERY COLD HE SAW THEN ON THE RIGHT A FAINT COIL OF SMOKE RISING AGAINST THE DUSKY SKY AND HE RODE STRAIGHT FOR IT THE SMOKE CAME FROM A STRONG DOUBLE CABIN STANDING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD
MY NAME'S LEFFINGWELL SETH LEFFINGWELL AN I LIVE HERE ALONE CEPTIN MY OLD WOMAN MANDY ALL WE ASK OF PEOPLE IS TO LET US BE LOTS OF US IN THE MOUNTAIN FEEL THAT WAY LET THEM LOWLANDERS SHOOT ONE ANOTHER UP EZ LONG EZ THEY PLEASE BUT UP HERE THERE AIN'T NO SLAVES
AND HIS AND THE SOUTHERN TROOPS MET IN A FIERCE CLASH SHORTLY AFTER DAWN BEAUREGARD DRAWN BY THE FIRING AT THAT POINT AND NOTICING THE COURAGE AND TENACITY WITH WHICH THE NORTHERN TROOPS HELD THEIR GROUND SENDING IN VOLLEY AFTER VOLLEY
A THIRD SIGNAL OF ALARM WAS PROMPTLY REGISTERED ON HIS BRAIN HE LEANED FROM THE BED AND PULLING ASIDE THE CURTAIN A HALF AN INCH OR SO LOOKED INTO THE ROOM THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN EXCEPT A FEW COALS WHICH CAST BUT A FAINT LIGHT
HE SAT UP IN HIS BED AND BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A HOT AND ACHING HEAD THEN HE REMEMBERED THE WINDOW AND SOFTLY DRAWING TWO PEGS THAT FASTENED IT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT NOT AWAKEN HIS GOOD HOSTS HE OPENED IT INWARD A FEW INCHES THE COLD AIR POURED IN AT THE CREVICE AND FELT LIKE HEAVEN ON HIS FACE
WHO PROTESTED AGAIN THAT IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TAKE THE HORSE AS FOR THE DISPATCHES IT WASN'T WISE FOR THEM TO FOOL WITH SUCH THINGS BUT KERINS INSISTED ON GOING THE WHOLE ROUTE AND THE YOUNG LEFFINGWELLS WERE WITH HIM
NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS BOY RODE STRAIGHT FROM THE TENT OF GENERAL THOMAS HISSELF HE'S A UNION SOJER AN YOUNG AS HE IS HE'S AN OFFICER HE WOULDN'T BE SENT OUT BY GENERAL THOMAS HISSELF LESS IT WAS ON BIG BUSINESS HE'S GOT MESSAGES DISPATCHES OF SOME KIND THAT ARE WORTH A HEAP TO SOMEBODY
AND BEATING OFF EVERY ATTEMPT OF SKIRMISHERS OR CAVALRY TO MOLEST THEM IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE LAST SHOT WAS FIRED AND THE SOUTHERN ARMY AT ITS LEISURE RESUMED ITS MARCH TOWARD CORINTH PROTECTED ON THE FLANKS BY ITS CAVALRY
BUT WHEN A KICK FROM THE HORSE GRAZED THE EAR OF ONE OF THEM THEY KEPT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE HELLO HELLO CALLED DICK LOUDLY THIS ALSO WAS THE USUAL MOUNTAIN NOTIFICATION THAT A GUEST HAD COME AND THE HEAVY BOARD DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPENED INWARD
THE EXULTANT CHEER SWEPT THROUGH THE RANKS AGAIN AND BACK CAME THE DEFIANT REBEL YELL A YOUNG SOLDIER OFTEN FEELS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH AS TRUE INSTINCT AS A GENERAL DICK NOW KNEW THAT THE NORTH WOULD RECOVER THE FIELD AND THAT THE SOUTH CUT DOWN FEARFULLY
AND IT WAS IN FACT A BARRIER MORE AND MORE AS WITHOUT ITS COMMAND THE SECOND UNION ARMY COULD NEVER HAVE COME TO THE RELIEF OF THE FIRST DICK AFTER A WHILE SAW COLONEL WINCHESTER AND OTHER OFFICERS NEAR HIM THEY WERE TALKING OF THEIR LOSSES
IT HAD NOTED THE SOUND OF VOICES NEARBY AND AWAKENED HIM
THE BOY UNDRESSED AND GOT INTO BED PLACING HIS SADDLE BAGS ON THE FOOT OF IT AND THE PISTOL THAT HE CARRIED IN HIS BELT UNDER HIS HEAD HE FELL ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND HAD HE BEEN ASKED BEFOREHAND HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT NOTHING COULD AWAKE HIM BEFORE MORNING NEVERTHELESS HE AWOKE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
THEY WAITED YET A LITTLE WHILE LONGER AND THEN THE BOOM OF A HEAVY GUN IN THE FOREST TOLD THEM THAT THE ENEMY WAS ADVANCING TO BEGIN THE BATTLE AFRESH
AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO WOULD HAVE GONE HAD NOT NIGHT COME TO OUR HELP THEN WE HAVE BEEN BEATEN YES DICK WE HAVE BEEN BEATEN AND BEATEN BADLY IT WAS THE SURPRISE THAT DID IT HOW ON EARTH WE COULD HAVE LET THE SOUTHERN ARMY CREEP UPON US AND STRIKE UNAWARE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
AND DICK TURNED TO PENNINGTON AND WARNER WHO WERE NOT HURT SAVE FOR SLIGHT WOUNDS WARNER HAD RECOVERED HIS POISE AND WAS SOON AS CALM AND DRY AS EVER DICK HE SAID WE'RE SOME DISTANCE FROM WHERE WE STARTED THIS MORNING THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING SHOVED ALONG WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
GRANT AFTER A DAY IN WHICH ANY ONE OF A DOZEN CHANCES WOULD HAVE WRECKED HIM MUST HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IN VERY DEED AND TRUTH HE WAS THE FAVORITE CHILD OF FORTUNE WHEN ONE IS SAVED AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THE VERY VERGE HE BEGINS TO BELIEVE THAT FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE
HE AND GRANT HAD RECKONED THAT THE DECIMATED BRIGADES OF THE SOUTH COULD NOT STAND AT ALL BEFORE HIM BUT JUST AS ON THE FIRST DAY THEY CAME ON WITH THE FIERCE REBEL YELL HURLING THEMSELVES UPON SUPERIOR NUMBERS TAKING THE CANNON OF THEIR ENEMY LOSING THEM AND RETAKING THEM AND LOSING THEM AGAIN BUT NEVER YIELDING
YET BEAUREGARD AND HIS GENERALS WERE STILL SANGUINE OF COMPLETING THE VICTORY THEIR SCOUTS AND SKIRMISHERS HAD FAILED TO DISCOVER THAT THE ENTIRE ARMY OF BUELL ALSO WAS NOW IN FRONT OF THEM BRAGG WAS GATHERING HIS DIVISION ON THE LEFT TO HURL IT LIKE A THUNDERBOLT UPON GRANT'S SHATTERED BRIGADES
WHOLE BRIGADES AND REGIMENTS WERE CUT TO PIECES OR THROWN IN CONFUSION THE SOUTHERNERS CUT A WIDE GAP IN THE NORTHERN ARMY THROUGH WHICH THEY RUSHED IN TRIUMPH HOLDING THE CORINTH ROAD AGAINST EVERY ATTACK AND MAKING THEIR REAR SECURE
HOW THE BATTLE GROWS HOW THE SOUTH FIGHTS COLONEL WINCHESTER WALKED AWAY PRESENTLY AND JOINED SHERMAN WHO WAS EAGERLY WATCHING THE MIGHTY CONFLICT INTO WHICH HE KNEW THAT HIS OWN WORN AND SHATTERED TROOPS MUST SOONER OR LATER BE DRAWN
HE MORE THAN ANY OTHER WITH HIS VALOR PENETRATING MIND AND DECISION HAD SAVED THE NORTHERN ARMY FROM COMPLETE DESTRUCTION THE FIRST DAY AT SHILOH HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO AVERT DEFEAT BUT HE HAD PREVENTED UTTER RUIN HIS DIVISION ALONE HAD HELD TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN ATTACK UNTIL NIGHT CAME
HE MUST BRING INTO ACTION EVERY GUN AND MAN HE HAD OR HE WOULD YET LOSE IT WAS NOW TEN O'CLOCK AND THE NEW BATTLE HAD LASTED WITH THE UTMOST FURY AND DESPERATION FOR FOUR HOURS DICK AFTER GENERAL GRANT RODE ON FELT AS IF A SUDDEN THRILL HAD RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE ARMY
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS LINES SAYING LITTLE BUT SEEING EVERYTHING HIS TALL FORM WAS SEEN BY ALL HIS MEN HE TOO MUST HAVE FELT A SINGULAR THRILL AT THAT MOMENT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT HIS STAR WAS RISING
REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND BRIGADE AFTER BRIGADE CROSSED THE GUNS THAT NELSON HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE BEHIND WERE ALSO BROUGHT UP AND WERE TAKEN OVER WITH THE OTHER BATTERIES
AND SUDDENLY A GRAY SQUIRREL HOPPED OUT ON A BOUGH AND BEGAN TO CHATTER WILDLY DICK DESPITE HIMSELF LAUGHED BUT THE LAUGH WAS HYSTERICAL HE COULD APPRECIATE THE FEELINGS OF THE SQUIRREL WHICH PROBABLY HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN A HOLLOW OF THE TREE ALL DAY LONG LISTENING TO THIS TREMENDOUS BATTLE
HARDEE AND THE BISHOP GENERAL WERE IN THE CENTER AND BRECKINRIDGE LED THE RIGHT BUT AS THEY MOVED FORWARD TO ATTACK THE UNION TROOPS CAME OUT TO MEET THEM NELSON HAD OCCUPIED THE HIGH GROUND BETWEEN LICK AND OWL CREEKS
ALWAYS THE ASSAILANT THROUGH THE DAY ITS LOSSES HAD BEEN IMMENSE MANY THOUSANDS HAD FALLEN AND NO NEW TROOPS WERE COMING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE CONTINUAL REINFORCEMENTS CAME TO THE NORTH THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT NOT A SOLDIER CAME TO THE SOUTH
ALL ARMED HEAVILY AND THE RESEMBLANCE OF TWO OF THEM TO THE LEFFINGWELLS WAS SO STRIKING THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THEIR SONS NOW HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THOSE EMPTY STALLS THE THIRD MAN WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS SHOULDER TOWARD DICK TURNED HIS FACE PRESENTLY AND THE BOY WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED AN EXCLAMATION
HE SAW MEN RISING FROM THE EARTH AND TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS HE SAW GUNNERS GATHERING AROUND THEIR GUNS AND MAKING READY WITH THE AMMUNITION HE KNEW THE REMAINS OF GRANT'S ARMY WERE ABOUT TO MARCH UPON THE ENEMY HELPING THE ARMY OF THE OHIO TO ACHIEVE THE TASK THAT HAD PROVED SO GREAT
THE OTHERS HOWEVER SUMMONED THEIR COURAGE ANEW AND PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT ARRANGING THEIR FORCES CHEERING THE MEN AND PREPARING FOR THE MORN THEIR SCOUTS AND SKIRMISHERS KEPT WATCH ON THE NORTHERN CAMP AND THE SOUTHERNERS BELIEVED THAT WHILE THEY HAD WHIPPED ONLY ONE ARMY THE DAY BEFORE THEY COULD WHIP TWO ON THE MORROW
EVER INCREASING IN VOLUME AND WATCHED THE VAST CLOUDS OF SMOKE GATHERING OVER THE FOREST HE COULD SEE FROM WHERE HE STOOD THE FLASH OF RIFLE FIRE AND THE BLAZE OF CANNON AND BOTH EYE AND EAR TOLD HIM THAT THE BATTLE WAS NOT MOVING BACK UPON THE SOUTH
SHERMAN MC CLERNAND AND OTHER GENERALS NOW PASSED AMONG THEIR TROOPS CHEERING THEM TELLING THEM THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO WIN BACK WHAT THEY HAD LOST THE DAY BEFORE AND THAT VICTORY WAS SURE THEY CALLED UPON THEM FOR ANOTHER GREAT EFFORT AND A SHOUT ROLLED ALONG THE LINE OF WILLING SOLDIERS
LEFFINGWELL'S WIFE A POWERFUL WOMAN AS LARGE AS HER HUSBAND AND WITH A PLEASANT FACE GAVE DICK A LARGE HAND AND A FRIENDLY GRASP IT'S A GOOD NIGHT TO BE INDOORS SHE SAID SUPPER'S READY SETH WILL YOU AN THE STRANGER SET
SHE HAD PLACED THE PINE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND DICK NOTICED THAT IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH FOR FIVE OR SIX PERSONS HE PUT HIS SADDLE BAGS AND BLANKETS IN A CORNER AND HE AND THE MAN DREW UP CHAIRS HE HAD SELDOM BEHELD A MORE CHEERFUL SCENE
THE SOUTHERN GENERALS FELT THE IMMENSE WEIGHT OF THE NUMBERS THAT WERE NOW DRIVING DOWN UPON THEM THEIR DECIMATED RANKS COULD NOT WITHSTAND THE CHARGE OF TWO ARMIES IN THE CENTER WHERE BUELL'S MEN HAVING STOOD FAST FROM THE FIRST WERE NOW ADVANCING
IT WAS THE ONE WHO HAD REINED HIS HORSE ACROSS THE ROAD TO STOP HIM A FOURTH AND CONCLUSIVE SIGNAL OF ALARM WAS REGISTERED UPON HIS BRAIN HE BEGAN TO DRESS RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT NOISE MEANWHILE HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND COULD HEAR THE WORDS THEY SPOKE
IT WAS NOT YET DAWN AND A LIGHT RAIN WAS FALLING BUT SMOLDERING FIRES DISCLOSED THE GROUND FOR SOME DISTANCE AND ALSO THE RIVER ON WHICH THE GUNBOATS AND TRANSPORTS WERE NOW GATHERED IN A FLEET COLONEL WINCHESTER BECKONED TO HIM ALL RIGHT THIS MORNING DICK HE SAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AS HE LOOKS LIKE A HEALTHY MAN TWOULDN'T DO FOR ME TO BE TOO HEARTY SAID LEFFINGWELL OR I'D KEEP MANDY HERE COOKIN ALL THE TIME THEY SEEMED PLEASANT PEOPLE TO DICK GOOD HONEST MOUNTAIN TYPES AND HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD FOUND THEIR HOUSE
THEIR ARMIES HAD BEEN TOO TERRIBLY SHAKEN TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTACK NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEIR MEN HAD FALLEN AND THE DEAD AND WOUNDED STILL LAY SCATTERED WIDELY THROUGH THE WOODS THE SOUTH HAD LOST ALMOST AS MANY NEARLY A THIRD OF HER ARMY HAD BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE BATTLE
THEY ATE FIERCELY AT FIRST ALMOST LIKE WOLVES BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY RESOLVED INTO THEIR TRUE STATE AS AMIABLE YOUNG HUMAN BEINGS AND WERE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES ALL THE WHILE BUELL'S ARMY OF THE OHIO WAS PASSING OVER THE RIVER AND JOINING GRANT'S ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE
BUT FOR THREE HOURS BUELL HAD BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM BEING SWEPT AWAY THE SOUTHERN TROOPS SEEMED ANIMATED BY THAT EXTRAORDINARY BATTLE FEVER AND ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT OF DEATH WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM SO OFTEN DURING THIS WAR
I'M GRATEFUL SAID DICK FALLING INTO THE SPIRIT OF IT
THE BUGLES SOUNDED THE RETREAT AND RELUCTANTLY THEY GAVE UP THE GROUND WHICH THEY HAD WON WITH SO MUCH COURAGE AND DARING THEY RETREATED RATHER AS VICTORS THAN DEFEATED MEN PRESENTING A BRISTLING FRONT TO THE ENEMY UNTIL THEIR REGIMENTS WERE LOST IN THE FOREST
THEY ALSO TALKED MUCH OF THE BATTLE MANY OF THEM WERE YET UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYSTERICAL EXCITEMENT THEY TOLD EXTRAORDINARY STORIES OF THE THINGS THEY HAD SEEN AND DONE AND THEY BELIEVED ALL THEY TOLD WERE TRUE
THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY SAT WAS LARGE APPARENTLY USED FOR ALL PURPOSES KITCHEN DINING ROOM SITTING ROOM AND BEDROOM AN OLD FASHIONED SQUIRREL RIFLE LAY ON HOOKS PROJECTING FROM THE WALL BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF A WEAPON
WEARY THOUGH THE SOUTHERN SOLDIERS WERE THEIR ATTACK WAS MADE WITH UTMOST FIRE AND VIGOR A LONG AND FURIOUS COMBAT ENSUED A SOUTHERN DIVISION UNDER CHEATHAM RUSHED TO THE HELP OF THEIR FELLOWS
THE SOUTHERN ARMY MUST HAVE SUFFERED ALMOST EQUALLY SO AND WOULD FACE THEM AT DAWN WITH NUMBERS FAR LESS THAN THEIR OWN HE HAD NOT DISPLAYED THE GREATEST SKILL BUT HE HAD SHOWN THE GREATEST MORAL COURAGE AND NOW ON THE NIGHT BETWEEN BATTLES IT WAS THAT QUALITY THAT WAS NEEDED MOST
SOME PRISONERS WHOM WE HAVE TAKEN SAY THAT JOHNSTON HAS BEEN KILLED AND BEAUREGARD IS NO SUCH LEADER AS HE WILL THE ARMY OF GENERAL BUELL REACH US TONIGHT BUELL HIMSELF IS HERE HE HAS BEEN WITH GRANT FOR SOME TIME AND ALL HIS BRIGADES ARE MARCHING AT THE DOUBLE QUICK
WHAT IS IT DICK ASKED WARNER I'VE REALIZED ALL AT ONCE THAT I'M TREMENDOUSLY HUNGRY THE CONFEDERATES BROKE UP OUR BREAKFAST WE NEVER HAD TIME TO THINK OF DINNER AND NOW ITS NOTHING TO EAT ME TOO SAID PENNINGTON
GRATEFUL FOR THE FRESH AIR THE SAME MYSTERIOUS POWER GAVE HIM A SECOND WARNING SIGNAL HE HEARD THE HUM OF VOICES AND SAT UP AGAIN IT WAS MERELY THE LEFFINGWELLS IN THE BED AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM TALKING
BUT HIS FEAR WAS GREATEST LEST HE MIGHT LOSE THE PRECIOUS DISPATCHES THAT HE BORE FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO HE MIGHT TAKE HIS PISTOLS AND FIGHT BUT HE COULD NOT FIGHT THEM ALL WITH SUCCESS THEN THAT PLEASANT FLOOD OF COLD AIR GAVE HIM THE KEY
THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE SUN AGAIN SHOT DOWN SHEAVES OF FIERY RAYS UPON A VAST LOW CLOUD OF FIRE AND SMOKE IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF MEN MET IN DESPERATE COMBAT NINE O'CLOCK CAME
S'POSE WE JEST TAKE THE HOSS AND SEND THE BOY ON A HOSS LIKE THAT WOULD BE KNOWED PROTESTED THE WOMAN WHAT IF SOJERS COME LOOKIN FUR HIM WE COULD RUN HIM OFF IN THE HILLS AN KEEP HIM THERE A WHILE SAID LEFFINGWELL I KNOW PLACES WHERE SOJERS WOULDN'T FIND THAT HOSS IN A THOUSAND YEARS
YES SIR I'M READY FOR MY DUTY AND YOU TOO WARNER AND PENNINGTON WE ARE SIR THEY REPLIED TOGETHER THEN KEEP CLOSE BESIDE ME I DON'T KNOW WHEN I MAY WANT YOU FOR A MESSAGE DAYBREAK WILL BE HERE IN A HALF HOUR
FRESH AND WITH UNBROKEN RANKS NOT A MAN WOUNDED OR MISSING THEY HAD ENTERED THE BATTLE AND BOTH GRANT AND BUELL AS WELL AS THEIR DIVISION COMMANDERS EXPECTED AN EASY VICTORY WHERE THE ARMY OF THE OHIO STOOD BUELL TO HIS AMAZEMENT SAW HIMSELF REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE
THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES WERE DILATED AND A RED SPOT GLOWED IN EITHER CHEEK LIKE ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS HE WAS STUNG BY THE SURPRISE AND DEFEAT AND HE COULD BARELY WAIT FOR THE MORNING AND REVENGE COLONEL WINCHESTER WALKED AWAY TO A COUNCIL THAT HAD BEEN CALLED
AND YET THEY RETIRED IN GOOD ORDER SHOWING THE DESPERATE VALOR OF THESE SONS OF HERS THE DOUBLE ARMY WHICH HAD SAVED ITSELF BUT WHICH HAD YET BEEN UNABLE TO DESTROY ITS ENEMY SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN THE RECOVERED CAMP THE GENERALS DISCUSSED IN SUBDUED TONES THEIR NARROW ESCAPE
CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE FIERCE FINISH OF SHILOH
BUELL'S ARMY WAS DRIVEN IN ON BOTH FLANKS AND ONLY THE CENTER HELD FAST IT BEGAN TO SEEM POSSIBLE THAT THE SOUTH DESPITE HER REDUCED RANKS MIGHT YET DEFEAT BOTH NORTHERN ARMIES ANOTHER BATTERY DASHED UP TO THE RELIEF OF THE MEN IN BLUE
SHERMAN'S WHOLE DIVISION NOW RAISED ITSELF UP AND RUSHED AT THE ENEMY DICK AND HIS COMRADES IN THE FRONT OF THEIR OWN REGIMENT THE WHOLE NORTHERN LINE WAS NOW ENGAGED GRANT TRUE TO HIS RESOLUTION HAD HURLED EVERY MAN AND EVERY GUN UPON HIS FOE
THE TWILIGHT WAS FAST DEEPENING INTO NIGHT THE LAST ROSY GLOW OF THE SUN FADED AND THICK DARKNESS ENVELOPED THE VAST FOREST IN WHICH TWENTY THOUSAND MEN HAD FALLEN AND IN WHICH MOST OF THEM YET LAY THE WOUNDED WITH THE DEAD
LEW WALLACE ARRIVED LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AGO WITH SEVEN THOUSAND MEN FRESH AND EAGER FOR BATTLE DICK DICK MY BOY WE'LL HAVE FORTY THOUSAND NEW TROOPS ON THE FIELD AT THE NEXT DAWN AND BEFORE GOD WE'LL WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE OF TODAY LISTEN TO THE BIG GUNS FROM THE BOATS AS THEY SPEAK AT INTERVALS
SHUT UP JIM YOU FOOL SAID HIS MOTHER SHARPLY DO YOU WANT MURDER ON YOUR HANDS STEALIN HOSSES IS BAD ENOUGH BUT IF THAT BOY HAS GOT THE BIG DISPATCHES YOU SAY HE HAS AN HE'S MISSIN DON'T YOU THINK THAT SOJERS WILL COME AFTER HIM
THEY WERE COMPELLED TO GIVE WAY AND LOST SEVERAL GUNS ON THE WINGS THE HEAVY NORTHERN BRIGADES WERE ADVANCING ALSO AND THE WHOLE SOUTHERN LINE WAS PUSHED BACK SO MUCH INFERIOR WAS THE SOUTH IN NUMBERS THAT HER ENEMY BEGAN TO OVERLAP HER ON THE FLANKS ALSO
THOSE BLINDING FLASHES OF FLAME NO LONGER CAME FROM THE FOREST BEFORE HIM THE SHOT AND SHELL QUIT THEIR HORRIBLE SCREAMING AND THE AIR WAS FREE FROM THE UNPLEASANT HISS OF COUNTLESS BULLETS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF A LITTLE AND STOOD UP
THE GREAT CONFLICT INCREASED IN VIOLENCE BUELL A MAN OF IRON COURAGE SAW THAT HIS SOLDIERS MUST FIGHT TO THE UTTERMOST NOT FOR VICTORY ONLY BUT EVEN TO WARD OFF DEFEAT THE DAWN WAS NOW FAR ADVANCED
SERGEANT DANIEL WHITLEY WAS LEANING AGAINST A STUMP AND WHILE HE WAS CALMLY LIGHTING A PIPE HE REGARDED THE THREE BOYS WITH A BENEVOLENT GAZE NONE OF YOU NEED BE ASHAMED OF BEIN SCARED HE SAID I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF FIGHTS MYSELF THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE MERE SKIRMISHES WHEN PUT ALONGSIDE OF THIS
AND THE SIGHT OF THE HEAVY LOG WALLS MADE DICK ALL THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET INSIDE THEM THE COLD HAD GROWN BITTER AND EVEN HIS HORSE SHIVERED AS HE APPROACHED TWO YELLOW CURS RUSHED FORTH AND BEGAN TO BARK FURIOUSLY SNAPPING AT THE HORSE'S HEELS THE USUAL MOUNTAIN WELCOME
THEY GAVE THE NAMES OF MANY GENERALS AND COLONELS WHO HAD BEEN KILLED PRESENTLY THEY MOVED AWAY AND HE FELL INTO AN UNEASY SLEEP OR RATHER DOZE FROM WHICH HE WAS AWAKENED AFTER A WHILE BY A HEAVY RUMBLING SOUND OF A DISTANT CANNONADE THE BOY SPRANG UP WONDERING WHY ANY ONE SHOULD WISH TO RENEW THE BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
THE DESIRE TO RETRIEVE THEIR FORTUNES WAS AS STRONG AMONG THE FARMER LADS AS IT WAS AMONG THE OFFICERS WHO TOOK CARE TO SPREAD AMONG THEM THE STATEMENT THAT BUELL'S ARMY ALONE WAS AS NUMEROUS AS THE SOUTHERN FORCE AND PROBABLY MORE NUMEROUS SINCE THEIR ENEMY MUST HAVE SUSTAINED TERRIBLE LOSSES
AND CARRYING WITH IT THE ASSURANCE THAT ALTHOUGH NOT VICTORIOUS OVER TWO ARMIES IT HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS OVER ONE AND HAD STRUCK THE MOST STUNNING BLOW YET KNOWN IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN THE LAST OF THE SOUTHERN REGIMENTS DISAPPEARED IN THE DEEP WOODS
IT WAS CHARGED AT ONCE BY THE MEN IN GRAY SO FIERCELY THAT THE GUNNERS WERE GLAD TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR GUNS AND ONCE MORE THE WILD REBEL YELL OF TRIUMPH SWELLED THROUGH THE SOUTHERN FOREST DICK STANDING WITH HIS COMRADES ON ONE OF THE RIDGES THAT THEY HAD DEFENDED SO WELL LISTENED TO THE ROAR OF CONFLICT ON THE WING
I MUST AT ONCE I THINK HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS THAT HERE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND THAT IT STILL SURROUNDED ITS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH POISONOUS FUMES AND THAT I WAS APPROACHING IT I MUST HAVE SOMEHOW CRAWLED
AND THIS SECOND THING I REMEMBER THAT ON REACHING HOME I WALKED INTO MY DISORDERED LIBRARY FOR I HAD HAD TO HUNT OUT SOME BOOKS WHERE I MET MY HOUSEKEEPER IN THE ACT OF REARRANGING THINGS
STILL I WAS TIRED AND WENT UPON DECK WHERE I HAD THE THREADBARE BLUE VELVET EASY CHAIR WITH THE BROKEN LEFT ARM BEFORE THE WHEEL
A SMALL SEMICIRCLE OF SPERANZA GOLD PLATE BEFORE ME AND NEAR ABOVE ME THE RED SHADED LAMP WITH GREEN CONICAL RESERVOIR WHOSE CREAKINGS NEVER CEASE IN THE STILLEST MID SEA
BUT WE SAW THAT HIS PRESENT SYMPTOMS WERE NOT ATROPINE SYMPTOMS BUT IT ALMOST SEEMED OF SOME OTHER VEGETABLE POISON WHICH WE COULD NOT PRECISELY NAME MYSTERIOUS THING
AND FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE MORE FIENDISHLY FEROCIOUS FINALLY BY DINT OF THROWING I GOT THE ROPE LOOP ROUND A MAST STUMP DREW MYSELF UP AND MADE FAST THE BOAT MY LEFT HAND CUT BY SOME CURSED SHELL AND ALL FOR WHAT
THIS I TOOK AND WENT BACK TO THE SPERANZA FOR THAT SHIP WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMPTINESS AND A STENCH OF THE CRUDE ELEMENTS OF LIFE NEARLY ASSIMILATED NOW TO THE RANK DEEP TO WHICH SHE WAS WEDDED AND SOON TO BE ABSORBED INTO ITS NATURE
THEIR AGE AND THOUGHT AND WAY OF LIFE AND BEARDS TILL THE DESIRE AROSE WITHIN ME TO GO TO HER AND SEE AND I THREW OFF MY OUTER GARMENTS UNCOVERED AND UNROPED THE CEDAR CUTTER THE ONLY BOAT EXCEPT THE AIR PINNACE LEFT TO ME INTACT
WAS A THING SO FANTASTICALLY MANIAC AS TO DRAW FROM ME AT TIMES SUDDEN FITS OF WILD RED LAUGHTER THAT LEFT ME FAINT DURING A SPACE OF FOUR MONTHS FROM THE EIGHTEENTH JUNE TO THE TWENTY THIRD OCTOBER
I VISITED THE FIJIS WHERE I SAW SKULLS STILL SURROUNDED WITH REMNANTS OF EXTRAORDINARY HALOES OF STIFF HAIR WOMEN CLAD IN GIRDLES MADE OF THONGS FIXED IN A BELT AND IN SAMOA NEAR BODIES CROWNED WITH CORONETS OF NAUTILUS SHELL
BUT TEN HEWN PILLARS OF WATER WITH UNIFORM DIAMETER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ONLY A LITTLE TWISTED HERE AND THERE AND AS I DIVINE FIFTY METRES IN GIRTH FIVE TEN STUPENDOUS MINUTES WE LOOK
AND ALSO THEY WORE WOODEN MASKS AND GREAT RINGS FOR THE EAR NO DOUBT WHICH MUST HAVE FALLEN TO THE SHOULDERS FOR THE EARTH WAS IN THEM ALL AND MADE THEM WILD PERVERSE AND VARIOUS LIKE HERSELF I WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM WHATEVER
IT WAS FULL OF REASSURANCE OF FREE INNOCENCE I SAID TO MYSELF I MUST SURELY BE MAD AN ORDINARY CHAT BEGAN WHILE CLODAGH TURNED UP PETERS SLEEVE AND KNEELING THERE INJECTED HIS FORE ARM
THE SEA SMOOTH AND PALE WITH THE SMOOTH PALLOR OF STRONG CURRENTS THE SHIP STILL ENOUGH NO LAND IN SIGHT YET GREAT TRACTS OF SEA WEED MAKING EASTWARD
SHE WAS IN MY OPINION THE MOST SUPERB OF CREATURES CLODAGH THAT HAUGHTY NECK WHICH SEEMED ALWAYS SCORNING SOMETHING JUST BEHIND HER LEFT SHOULDER SUPERB
SHE WAS LONG SHE WAS LONG THE CRAZY THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH SOME DIM REGION OF MY SOUL WHY IS SHE SO LONG AH THAT WAS A PAIN WENT PETERS NEVER MIND THE BAZAAR AUNT THINK OF THE MORPHIA
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS TO INJECT ANYTHING TO NIGHT IS IT YES OR NO WHAT DO YOU THINK PETERS I SAID ANY MORE PAINS WELL PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GIVE US ANOTHER QUARTER HE ANSWERED THERE'S STILL SOME TROUBLE IN THE TUMMY OFF AND ON
I WAS AT THE ONE CALLED IN THE CHART SADDLE HILL THE SMALLEST OF THEM I THINK AND SELDOM HAVE I HAD SUCH SENSATIONS OF PEACE AS I LAY A WHOLE BURNING DAY IN A RISING VALE DEEPLY SHADED IN PALM AND TROPICAL RANKNESSES
WELL PERHAPS I KNOW THERE I SAT AND HEARD HIM AND MOST STRANGELY HAVE THOSE WORDS OF HIS PERORATION PLANTED THEMSELVES IN MY BRAIN WHEN RISING TO A PASSION OF PROPHECY HE SHOUTED
I ATE VORACIOUSLY WITH SWEAT AS USUAL POURING DOWN MY EAGER BROW USING KNIFE OR SPOON IN THE RIGHT HAND BUT NEVER THE WESTERN FORK LICKING THE PLATES CLEAN IN THE MOHAMMEDAN MANNER AND DRINKING PRETTY FREELY
I HAVE STILL A NAUSEA TO WRITE ABOUT IT LUCREZIA BORGIA IN HER OWN AGE MAY HAVE BEEN HEROIC BUT LUCREZIA IN THIS LATE CENTURY ONE COULD RETCH UP THE HEART THE MAN GREW SICK ON THAT BED I SAY
THE SHADOW OF A MIGHTY BACK A NEW BORN LAND BEARING UPWARDS TEN FLAMES OF FIRE SLOWLY STEADILY OUT OF THE SEA INTO THE CLOUDS
FOR I WISHED TO HAVE IT ALL OVER IN ONE OBNOXIOUS DAY I WAS THEREFORE VERY TIRED WHEN I WENT DOWN LIT THE CENTRAL CHAIN LEVER LAMP AND MY OWN TWO WASHED AND DRESSED IN MY BEDROOM AND SAT TO DINNER IN THE DINING HALL CORNER
I WAS GIVING HIM THREE QUARTER GRAINS OF MORPHIA A DAY THAT FRIDAY NIGHT AT ELEVEN P M I VISITED HIM AND FOUND CLODAGH THERE TALKING TO HIM PETERS WAS SMOKING A CIGAR AH CLODAGH SAID I WAS WAITING FOR YOU ADAM
FOR TO THIS DAY I HAVE NEVER BEEN AT THE PAINS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER I AM HERE WRITING NOW ON THE FIFTH OR THE SIXTH OF JUNE WELL ON THE FOURTH OR THE FIFTH EVENING AFTER THIS JUST AS THE SUN WAS SINKING BEYOND THE RIM OF THE SEA
HALF ASLEEP YET CONSCIOUS THE MOON CAME UP INTO A PRETTY CLOUDLESS SKY AND SHE WAS BRIGHT BUT NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO OUT SHINE THE ENLIGHTENED FLIGHT OF THE OCEAN WHICH THAT NIGHT WAS ONE CONTINUOUS SWAMP OF JACK O' LANTERN PHOSPHORESCENCE
WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WHO HAD PASSED THE EVENING WITH HIM AT CLODAGH'S IN HANOVER SQUARE WAS THERE WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MATTER HE SAID TO ME POISONED I ANSWERED GOOD GOD WHAT WITH ATROPINE
AND A THIRD THING I REMEMBER IN ALL THAT TURMOIL OF DOUBT AND FLURRY THAT AS THE SHIP MOVED DOWN WITH THE AFTERNOON TIDE A TELEGRAM WAS PUT INTO MY HAND IT WAS A LAST WORD FROM CLODAGH AND SHE SAID ONLY THIS
BUT AT THAT INSTANT A VOICE AT THE OPENED DOOR BEHIND ME SAID WELL HOW IS EVERYTHING IT WAS WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WHO STOOD THERE WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS I REMEMBERED AN UNDER LOOK OF MISTRUST WHICH I HAD ONCE SEEN ON HIS FACE
SHE HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN THE BOREAL KNEW THE DETAILS OF HER OUTFITTING AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION BUT NOW SUDDENLY HER MIND SEEMED WHOLLY POSSESSED MY MENTION OF CLARK'S VISIT APPARENTLY SETTING HER WELL A BURN WITH THE POLE FEVER
SAID CLARK TO ME WHEN WE WERE ALONE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT I SAID WHO ARE THE TWO NURSES OH HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PEOPLE OF MY OWN AT ANY RATE MY DREAM ABOUT YOU COMES TRUE JEFFSON
AND I MUST HAVE BEEN BACK TO UNTIE THE WHEEL IN GOOD TIME FOR WHEN MY SENSES CAME I WAS LYING THERE MY HEAD AGAINST THE UNDER GIMBAL ONE FOOT ON A SPOKE OF THE WHEEL NO LAND IN SIGHT AND MORNING BREAKING
THE SPERANZA DROVE STRAIGHT WITH THE CURRENT OF THE PHOSPHORUS SEA AS I ROSE I FELL FLAT AND WHAT I DID THEREAFTER I DID IN A STATE OF EXISTENCE WHOSE ACTS TO THE WAKING MIND APPEAR UNREAL AS DREAM
SO THAT THEY WERE EAGER FOLK AND THE WAYWARD DARK EARTH WAS IN THEM TOO AS SHE SHOULD BE IN HER CHILDREN THEY HAD IN MANY CASES SOME REDDISH DISCOLORATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRACES OF BETEL NUT STAINS FOR BETEL NUTS ABOUND THERE AND I WAS SO PLEASED WITH THESE PEOPLE
PETERS I CRIED YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT WITHOUT CONSULTING ME DO THAT ONCE MORE AND I SWEAR I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH YOU RUBBISH SAID PETERS WHY ALL THIS UNNECESSARY HEAT IT WAS A MERE FLEA BITE
AND BEGUMS WITH SPANGLED TRAINS AND ALL THE AIR FRAGRANT WITH THAT MORTAL SCENT AND HIGH AND WIDE UPLIFTED BEFORE ME STRETCHING FROM THE NORTHERN TO THE SOUTHERN LIMIT
HOWEVER THAT WAS ABOUT MIDNIGHT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE PETERS OPENED HIS EYES AND SMILED BY NOON THE NEXT DAY HIS FINE VITALITY WHICH SO FITTED HIM FOR AN ARCTIC EXPEDITION HAD RE ASSERTED ITSELF
THEY SAY SHE STOPPED SHE STOPPED THEY SAY WHAT HER VOICE DROPPED THAT PETER TAKES ATROPINE AH I STARTED THEN SHE MOVED FROM THE WINDOW SAT IN A ROCKING CHAIR
AND THAT NO DOUBT WAS THE REASON WHY SUCH A START CONVULSED ME FOR MY LISTLESS EYES HAD CHANCED TO REST UPON SOME WORDS THE WOMAN GAVE ME OF THE TREE AND I DID EAT
AS SHE ROSE LAUGHING AT SOMETHING SAID BY WILSON THE DRUG GLASS DROPPED FROM HER HAND AND HER HEEL BY AN APPARENT ACCIDENT TROD ON IT SHE PUT THE SYRINGE AMONG A NUMBER OF OTHERS ON THE MANTEL PIECE
AND BEING TO BECOME A SEA IN LITTLE AS I IN TIME MY GOD SHALL BE NOTHING BUT AN EARTH IN LITTLE DURING DINNER AND AFTER I READ THE BOOK WITH SOME DIFFICULTY FOR IT WAS PEN WRITTEN IN FRENCH AND DISCOLOURED
OPENING ANON A HEAVY LID TO DOZE AND DROWSE AGAIN AND GOD WOULD SIGH ENOUGH AND NOD AND BEING WOULD SWOON TO SLEEP FOR THAT ANY OLD CHINAMAN SHOULD BE ALIVE IN PEKIN
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE JOURNAL OF SOMEONE A PASSENGER AND VOYAGER I IMAGINE WHO CALLED HIMSELF ALBERT TISSU AND THE SHIP THE MARIE MEYER
THE PASSION OF HER KISS AS I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE THAT DAY I SHALL NOT FORGET I WENT HOME WITH A PRETTY HEAVY HEART THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PETER PETERS WAS THREE DOORS FROM MINE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET
AS THE MEREST WHIM DIRECTED IT OR THE MOVEMENT OF THE POINTER ON THE CHART AND I THOUGHT OF EATING THE LOTUS OF SURCEASE AND NEPENTHE IN SOME ENCHANTED NOOK OF THIS BOWERING SUMMER
AND SPARKS AND FLASHES ALL VEILED IN A GARISH HAZE OF LIGHT FOR THE FOUNDRY WORKED THOUGH LANGUIDLY AND UPON A ROCKY LAND FOUR MILES AHEAD WHICH NO CHART HAD EVER MARKED
WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THE BOREAL EXPEDITION AS DOCTOR BOTANIST AND METEOROLOGICAL ASSISTANT ON THAT DAY OF CLARK'S VISIT TO ME I HAD NOT BEEN SEATED FIVE MINUTES WITH CLODAGH WHEN I SAID DOCTOR CLARK HA HA HA HAS BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE EXPEDITION
I EASILY MIGHT HOWEVER HE WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY
WHICH IT WAS ALWAYS MY FIRST CARE TO SELECT FROM THE STORE ROOM OPEN AND LAY OUT ONCE FOR ALL IN THE MORNING ON RISING I WAS LATE SEVEN BEING MY HOUR FOR ON THAT DAY I HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THE OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY BUT ALWAYS DEFERRED TASK OF OVERHAULING THE SHIP
AND TURNED THE LEAVES OF A BOOK WITHOUT READING WE WERE SILENT SHE AND I I STANDING LOOKING AT HER SHE DRAWING THE THUMB ACROSS THE LEAF EDGES AND BEGINNING AGAIN CONTEMPLATIVELY
BUT I WAS SAYING THAT WHEN CLARK LEFT ME I WAS DRAWING ON MY GLOVES TO GO TO SEE MY FIANCEE THE COUNTESS CLODAGH WHEN I HEARD THE TWO VOICES MOST CLEARLY SOMETIMES THE URGENCY OF ONE OR OTHER IMPULSE IS SO OVERPOWERING
DOUBT IT THERE IS OUR MARRIAGE MARRIAGE INDEED
I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY SPECIAL AMBITION THAT WAY I REJOINED I AM VERY HAPPY IN MY WARM EDEN WITH MY CLODAGH I DON'T LIKE THE OUTER COLD DON'T LET ME THINK LITTLE OF YOU SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
A WILD BUT FAINT LUMINOSITY MINGLED WITH STARS AND FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE THE WHOLE TROOPING UNANIMOUSLY EASTWARD AS IF IN HASTE WITH ELFIN MOMENTOUS PURPOSE A BOUNDLESS CONGREGATION IN THE SWEEP OF A STRONG OCEANIC CURRENT
HERE I EXPERIENCED A SINGULAR GHOSTLY AWE AND TIMOROUSNESS LEST SHE SHOULD SINK WITH ME OR SOMETHING BUT STRIKING MATCHES I SAW AN ORDINARY CABIN WITH SOME FUNGOIDS SKULLS BONES AND RAGS BUT NOT ONE COHERING SKELETON
I HESITATED I HESITATED BUT I SAID HE IS IN THE HABIT OF TAKING ATROPINE WILSON THREE HOURS I REMAINED THERE AND GOD KNOWS TOILED HARD FOR HIS LIFE AND WHEN I LEFT HIM IN THE DARK OF THE FORE DAY
TO A TEN TIMES TRIUMPHANT EVENT YOU MEAN IF I PERSONALLY WERE THE FIRST TO STAND AT THE POLE BUT THERE ARE MANY IN AN EXPEDITION IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT I PERSONALLY FOR ME YOU WILL ADAM
A GODLESS WOMAN CLODAGH A BITTER HEART CLODAGH ONCE CONFESSED TO ME THAT HER FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN HISTORY WAS LUCREZIA BORGIA AND WHEN SHE SAW MY HORROR IMMEDIATELY ADDED WELL NO I AM ONLY JOKING
WAS THE UNLOOSENING AFRESH OF ALL MY EVIL PASSION FOR I SAID SINCE THEY MEAN TO SLAY ME DEATH SHALL FIND ME REBELLIOUS AND FOR WEEKS I COULD NOT SIGHT SOME SPECIALLY HAPPY VILLAGE OR UMBRAGEOUS SPREAD OF WOODLAND
PROBABLY AT THE RATE OF FOUR TO SIX KNOTS BUT I DID NOT CARE KNOWING VERY WELL THAT NO LAND WAS WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILES OF MY BOWS
AND BEYOND THE PLATES THE ARRAY OF PRESERVED SOUPS MEAT EXTRACTS MEATS FRUIT SWEETS WINES NUTS LIQUEURS COFFEE ON THE SILVER SPIRIT TRIPOD GLASSES CRUET AND SO ON
BY MINE BECAUSE HER FATHER AND GRANDFATHER HAD DIED IN LUNATIC ASYLUMS AND BY HERS BECAUSE FORSOOTH I WAS NEITHER A RICH NOR A NOBLE MATCH A SISTER OF HERS MUCH OLDER THAN HERSELF HAD MARRIED A COMMON COUNTRY DOCTOR
YOUR FRIEND HAS BEEN NAUGHTY MISTER WILSON SHE SAID AGAIN WITH THAT SAME POUT HE HAS BEEN TAKING MORE ATROPINE NOT REALLY SAID WILSON LET ME ALONE THE WHOLE OF YOU ANSWERED PETERS I AIN'T A CHILD
SHE WAS MY LOVE I STOOD LIKE MARBLE CLODAGH WENT TO MEET WILSON WITH FRANK RIGHT HAND IN THE LEFT BEING THE FRAGILE GLASS CONTAINING THE INJECTION MY EYES WERE FASTENED ON HER FACE
OR HIGH IN AIR CHOPPING LOOSE WITH ITS RIGGING THE MIZZEN TOP MAST WHICH SINCE A MONTH WAS SPRAINED AT THE CLAMPS ALL THIS IN COTTON DRAWERS UNDER LOOSE QUAMIS BARE FOOTED MY BEARD KNOTTED UP THE SUN A BLAZE
THAT I TOOK ON BOARD WITH THE GIG ONE OF THEIR LITTLE TREE CANOES WHICH WAS MY FOOLISHNESS FOR GIG AND CANOE WERE ONLY THREE NIGHTS LATER WASHED FROM THE DECKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA I PASSED DOWN THE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND IN THAT SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS
AND ON THE MORNING WHEN I FINALLY ROUSED MYSELF I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE SECOND OR THE THIRD MORNING SO THAT MY CALENDAR SO SCRUPULOUSLY KEPT MAY BE A DAY OUT
I SUPPOSE IN THE EVENING FOR HE DOES NOT SAY AND HE WRITES MONSTROUS EVENT PHENOMENON WITHOUT LIKENESS THE WITNESSES OF WHICH MUST FOR EVER LIVE IMMORTALISED IN THE ANNALS OF THE UNIVERSE AN EVENT WHICH WILL MAKE EVEN MAMA HENRI
AND GOT HER DOWN BY THE MIZZEN FIVE BLOCK PULLEY SYSTEM BUT IT WAS A RIDICULOUS NONSENSE FOR HAVING PADDLED TO HER I WAS THROWN INTO PAROXYSMS OF RAGE BY REPEATED FAILURES TO SCALE HER BULWARKS LOW AS THEY WERE MY HANDS INDEED COULD REACH
PETERS A TOUCHY FELLOW AT ONCE DICTATED A LETTER OF PROTEST TO CLARK AND CLARK SENT PETERS LETTER TO ME MARKED WITH A BIG NOTE OF INTERROGATION IN BLUE PENCIL NOW ALL PETERS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE MINE NOT
AND JULIETTE ADMIT THAT I WAS JUSTIFIED IN UNDERTAKING THIS MOST EVENTFUL VOYAGE TALKING WITH CAPTAIN TOMBAREL ON THE POOP WHEN A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM HIM MON DIEU HIS VISAGE WHITENS
OF WHICH I HAD PLENTY TO BLOW HER TO UTTERMOST HELL I HAD TO RETURN TO THE SPERANZA GET A HALF INCH ROPE THEN BACK TO THE OTHER FOR I WOULD NOT BE BAULKED IN SUCH A WAY THOUGH NOW THE DARK WAS COME ONLY SLIGHTLY TEMPERED BY A HALF MOON AND I GETTING HUNGRY
BREATHE NO WORD OF THE BOREAL AND CLARK'S VISIT AND ANOTHER SHOUT TELL TELL HIDE NOTHING IT SEEMED TO LAST A MONTH YET IT WAS ONLY SOME MINUTES BEFORE I WAS IN HANOVER SQUARE AND CLODAGH IN MY ARMS
FROM BOWSPRIT TIP TO POOP AND FROM BULWARKS TO WATER LINE STOUT AS A HEDGEHOG ONLY AWAITING THERE THE NEXT HIGH SEA TO FOUNDER IT BEING NEAR MY DINNER HOUR AND NIGHT'S REST I STOPPED THE SPERANZA SOME FIFTEEN YARDS FROM HER
THE SECOND WEEK PASSED AND ONLY TEN DAYS REMAINED BEFORE THE START OF THE EXPEDITION AT THE END OF THAT SECOND WEEK WILSON THE ELECTRICIAN WAS ONE EVENING SITTING BY PETER'S BEDSIDE WHEN I ENTERED
AND TRACES OF TURMERIC PAINT AND TATTOOING AND IN ONE TOWNLET A GREAT ASSEMBLAGE OF CARCASSES
I THOUGHT PROVED MISTRUST MEANTIME CLARK CAME EACH DAY HE HAD HIMSELF A MEDICAL DEGREE AND ABOUT THIS TIME I CALLED HIM IN PROFESSIONALLY TOGETHER WITH ALLEYNE OF CAVENDISH SQUARE
AND GONE TO THE MANTEL PIECE TO MELT ONE OF THE TABLETS IN A LITTLE OF THE DISTILLED WATER THERE HER BACK WAS TURNED UPON US AND SHE WAS A LONG TIME I WAS STANDING PETERS IN HIS ARM CHAIR SMOKING CLODAGH THEN BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT A CHARITY BAZAAR WHICH SHE HAD VISITED THAT AFTERNOON
I FIND A SENSUOUS PLEASURE ALMOST A SENSUAL IN DABBLING IN DELICATE DRUGS LIKE HELEN FOR THAT MATTER AND MEDEA AND CALYPSO AND THE GREAT ANTIQUE WOMEN WHO WERE ALL EXCELLENT CHYMISTS
THAT I DID NOT STOP THE SHIP AND LAND THE MATERIALS FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION SO THAT NEARLY ALL THOSE SPICY LANDS ABOUT THE NORTH OF AUSTRALIA WILL BEAR THE TRACES OF MY HAND FOR MANY A YEAR FOR MORE AND MORE MY VOYAGE BECAME DAWDLING AND ZIGZAGED
AND THE SEA AS ABSOLUTELY CALM AS A LAKE ROUGHENED WITH BREEZES YET MAKING A CONSIDERABLE NOISE IN ITS BREAKING ON THE SHORE AS I HAVE NOTICED IN THESE SORTS OF PLACES I DO NOT KNOW WHY
WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF MAST HEAVILY WATER LOGGED SOME RELICS OF OLD RIGGING HANGING OVER EVEN HER BOWSPRIT APPARENTLY BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE IT AND SHE NOTHING MORE THAN A HIRSUTE GREEN MASS OF OLD WEEDS AND SEA THINGS
AND HE HAD SIX DAYS IN WHICH TO RECOVER HIMSELF I THEREFORE WROTE TO CLARK SAYING THAT THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES OF COURSE ANNULLED MY ACCEPTANCE OF HIS OFFER THOUGH I HAD ALREADY INCURRED THE INCONVENIENCE OF NEGOTIATING WITH A LOCUM TENENS
THESE WERE THE LAST INTELLIGIBLE WORDS HE EVER SPOKE HE DIED SHORTLY BEFORE ONE A M HE HAD BEEN POISONED BY A POWERFUL DOSE OF ATROPINE
PRESENCE AT THE BED SIDE HERE SOMEHOW DOES NOT PLEASE ME IT IS SO UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY CERTAINLY SHE REPLIED BUT I ALWAYS HAD A GENIUS FOR NURSING AND A PASSION FOR WATCHING THE BATTLES OF THE BODY SINCE NO ONE OBJECTS WHY SHOULD YOU
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THAT SUBLIME EMERGENCE CEASES OR SEEMS TO CEASE THE GRAND THOUGHT THAT SMITES ME IS THIS I ALBERT TISSU AM IMMORTALISED MY NAME SHALL NEVER PERISH FROM AMONG MEN I RUSH DOWN I WRITE IT
TO PITCH AND ROLL VIOLENTLY AND THE SEA A MOMENT SINCE CALM IS NOW ROUGH AND AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE WHITE VAPOUR WE SEE A DARK SHADOW SLOWLY RISING
WILSON WAS GOING AS ELECTRICIAN OF THE EXPEDITION CLODAGH I SAID BELIEVE ME YOU JEST IN A MANNER WHICH DOES NOT PLEASE ME DO I REALLY SHE ANSWERED WITH THAT HAUGHTY STIFF HALF TURN OF HER THROAT
TOWARD ONE THAT NIGHT HIS FOOTMAN RAN TO KNOCK ME UP WITH THE NEWS THAT PETERS WAS VERY ILL I HURRIED TO HIS BED SIDE AND KNEW BY THE FIRST GLANCE AT HIS DELIRIUMS AND HIS STARING PUPILS THAT HE WAS POISONED WITH ATROPINE
IT IS AFFRIGHTING IT IS INTOLERABLE THE EYES CAN HARDLY BEAR TO WATCH THE EARS TO HEAR IT SEEMS UNHOLY TRAVAIL MONSTROUS BIRTH BUT IT LASTS NOT LONG ALL AT ONCE THE MARIE MEYER COMMENCES
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WONDER WHAT SHE WAS AND WHENCE AND WHY SHE DOZED SO DEEP FOR EVER AND AFTER AN AGE OF MELANCHOLY PEACE AND BURDENED BLISS I SHOULD NOTE THAT SUN AND MOON HAD CEASED REVOLVING AND HUNG INERT
PETERS OF TAUNTON AND THIS SO CALLED MESALLIANCE MADE THE SO CALLED MESALLIANCE WITH ME
THE PEOPLE OF NEW CALEDONIA ON THE OTHER HAND WENT I SHOULD THINK NAKED CONFINING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE HAIR AND IN THIS RESEMBLING THE FIJIANS FOR THEY SEEMED TO WEAR AN ARTIFICIAL HAIR MADE OF THE FUR OF SOME CREATURE LIKE A BAT
BRUSHING HERE A ROPE WITH TAR THERE A BOARD WITH PAINT THERE A CRANK WITH OIL RUBBING A DOOR HANDLE A BRASS FITTING FILLING THE THREE CABIN LAMPS DUSTING MIRRORS AND FURNITURE DASHING THE GREAT NEAT JOINERED PLAINS OF DECK WITH BUCKETFULLS
FOR WILSON TOOK UP THE DEPOSITED MEDICINE GLASS ELEVATED IT LOOKED AT IT SMELLED INTO IT AND HE DID IT WITH A KIND OF HURRIED LIGHT FINGERED STEALTH AND HE DID IT WITH AN UNDER LOOK AND A MEANINGNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH
OR DRAGGED MYSELF FORWARD THERE IS AN IMPRESSION ON MY MIND THAT IT WAS A PURPLE LAND OF PURE PORPHYRY THERE IS SOME FAINT MEMORY OR DREAM OF HEARING A LONG DRAWN BOOMING OF WAVES UPON ITS CRAGS I DO NOT KNOW WHENCE I HAVE THEM
A ROW OF EIGHT OR NINE INFLAMED SMOKES AS FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF SOME CYCLOPEAN FOUNDRY A WORK ALL NIGHT MOST SOLEMN MOST GREAT AND DREADFUL IN THE SOLEMN NIGHT
HE WAS THEN LEANING ON AN ELBOW TALKING TO WILSON AND EXCEPT HIS PALLOR AND STRONG STOMACH PAINS THERE WAS NOW HARDLY A TRACE OF HIS LATE APPROACH TO DEATH FOR THE PAINS I PRESCRIBED SOME QUARTER GRAIN TABLETS OF SULPHATE OF MORPHIA AND WENT AWAY
SHE CAME CLOSER TO MY EAR SAYING I HEARD THE NEWS EARLY I AM COME TO STAY WITH HIM TILL THE LAST WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SOME TIME EYE TO EYE STEADILY SHE AND I BUT MINE DROPPED BEFORE CLODAGH'S
BUT I COULD NO MORE HELP IT THAN I COULD FLY CLODAGH WAS STANDING AT A WINDOW HOLDING A ROSE AT HER FACE FOR QUITE A MINUTE SHE MADE NO REPLY I SAW HER SHARP CUT FLORID FACE IN PROFILE STEADILY BENT AND SMELLING
I SLEPT TILL ELEVEN A M AND THEN HURRIED OVER AGAIN TO PETERS IN THE ROOM WERE MY TWO NURSES AND CLODAGH MY BELOVED PUT HER FOREFINGER TO HER LIPS WHISPERING
DOUBTLESS STILL THERE CAN NO MORE BE SEEN FOR THE OCEAN ALL ABOUT THEM IS STEAMING HISSING HIGHER THAN THE PILLARS A DENSE WHITE VAPOUR VAST IN EXTENT WHOSE VENOMOUS SIBILATION WE AT THIS DISTANCE CAN QUITE DISTINCTLY HEAR
IN THE SECOND STARBOARD BERTH WAS A SMALL TABLE AND ON THE FLOOR A THICK ROUND INK POT WHOSE CONTINUAL ROLLING ON ITS SIDE MADE ME LOOK DOWN AND THERE I SAW A FLAT SQUARE BOOK WITH BLACK COVERS WHICH CURVED HALF OPEN OF ITSELF FOR IT HAD BEEN WET AND STAINED
NOT A WORD I SAID TO HER THAT DAY ABOUT CLARK'S INVITATION YET I ASKED MYSELF REPEATEDLY DID SHE NOT KNOW OF IT HAD SHE NOT LISTENED AND HEARD
THIS IS A CASE THAT I DISLIKE I HAVE HALF A MIND TO THROW IT TO THE DEVIL THEN DO SO AND YOU TOO GO HOME GO HOME CLODAGH BUT WHY IF ONE DOES NO HARM
FROM THAT MOMENT TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE BOREAL BORE ME DOWN THE THAMES ALL THE WORLD WAS A MERE TUMBLING NIGHTMARE TO ME OF WHICH HARDLY ANY DETAIL REMAINS IN MY MEMORY ONLY I REMEMBER THE INQUEST AND HOW I WAS CALLED UPON TO PROVE
NOW DAVID WILSON AND I NEVER GREATLY LOVED EACH OTHER AND THAT VERY DAY HE BROUGHT ABOUT A PAINFUL SITUATION AS BETWEEN PETERS AND ME BY TELLING PETERS THAT I HAD TAKEN HIS PLACE IN THE EXPEDITION
AND AFTER A TIME THE CIGAR DROOPED AND DROPPED FROM MY MOUTH AND SLEEP OVERCAME ME AND I SLEPT THERE IN THE LAP OF THE INFINITE SO THAT SOMETHING PRESERVES ME SOMETHING SOMEONE AND FOR WHAT
NEARLY SKELETONS YET WITH LIMBS AND VERTEBRAE STILL IN GENERAL COHERING AND IN SOME CASES DRY SKINNED AND MUMMIFIED RELICS OF FLESH AND NEVER ANYWHERE A SIGN OF CLOTHES
THAT WAS WHY HE BROKE PRISON SIR HE KNEW THAT I WAS HERE AND THAT WE COULD NOT REFUSE TO HELP HIM WHEN HE DRAGGED HIMSELF HERE ONE NIGHT WEARY AND STARVING WITH THE WARDERS HARD AT HIS HEELS WHAT COULD WE DO
LET US SEE IF THERE IS ANY ANSWER I HELD IT AS HE HAD DONE AND STARED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT VAGUELY I COULD DISCERN THE BLACK BANK OF THE TREES
I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU NOW SUGGEST SAID I HE WOULD FOLLOW BARRYMORE AND SEE WHAT HE DID THEN WE SHALL DO IT TOGETHER BUT SURELY HE WOULD HEAR US THE MAN IS RATHER DEAF AND IN ANY CASE
IT WAS AS COLD AS A BLOCK OF MARBLE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT TOMORROW I DON'T THINK I'LL GET THAT CRY OUT OF MY HEAD
JUST ABOUT THE HOUR YOU NAME PERHAPS THEN HE PAYS A VISIT EVERY NIGHT TO THAT PARTICULAR WINDOW I SUGGESTED PERHAPS HE DOES IF SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHADOW HIM AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER I WONDER WHAT YOUR FRIEND HOLMES WOULD DO IF HE WERE HERE
THIS THEN WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE STEALTHY EXPEDITIONS AT NIGHT AND THE LIGHT AT THE WINDOW SIR HENRY AND I BOTH STARED AT THE WOMAN IN AMAZEMENT WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS STOLIDLY RESPECTABLE PERSON
BUT I MUST ALLOW THAT NO MAN COULD MAKE A MORE HANDSOME APOLOGY THAN HE HAS DONE DID HE GIVE ANY EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT HIS SISTER IS EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE HE SAYS THAT IS NATURAL ENOUGH AND I AM GLAD THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HER VALUE
DID NOT FORESEE SOME THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON THE MOOR YOU UNDERSTAND ME I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE THE LAST MAN IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD WISH TO BE A SPOIL SPORT I MUST GO OUT ALONE IT PUT ME IN A MOST AWKWARD POSITION
I ASSURE YOU MY CHEEKS FLUSHED AT THE VERY THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN NOW BE TOO LATE TO OVERTAKE HIM SO I SET OFF AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION OF MERRIPIT HOUSE I HURRIED ALONG THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF MY SPEED WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING OF SIR HENRY
THERE FEARING THAT PERHAPS I HAD COME IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AFTER ALL I MOUNTED A HILL FROM WHICH I COULD COMMAND A VIEW THE SAME HILL WHICH IS CUT INTO THE DARK QUARRY THENCE I SAW HIM AT ONCE HE WAS ON THE MOOR PATH ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF
NOTHING AT ALL THE BUTLER BROKE IN I ASSURE YOU SIR MOVE YOUR LIGHT ACROSS THE WINDOW WATSON CRIED THE BARONET SEE THE OTHER MOVES ALSO
AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT OUR FRIEND HAS LARGE IDEAS AND MEANS TO SPARE NO PAINS OR EXPENSE TO RESTORE THE GRANDEUR OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THE HOUSE IS RENOVATED AND REFURNISHED ALL THAT HE WILL NEED WILL BE A WIFE TO MAKE IT COMPLETE BETWEEN OURSELVES
WE CANNOT LET HIM PERISH AT OUR VERY GATES THE LIGHT IS A SIGNAL TO HIM THAT FOOD IS READY FOR HIM AND HIS LIGHT OUT YONDER IS TO SHOW THE SPOT TO WHICH TO BRING IT THEN YOUR BROTHER IS THE ESCAPED CONVICT SIR SELDEN THE CRIMINAL
AFTER THE CONVERSATION WHICH I HAVE QUOTED ABOUT BARRYMORE SIR HENRY PUT ON HIS HAT AND PREPARED TO GO OUT AS A MATTER OF COURSE I DID THE SAME WHAT ARE YOU COMING WATSON HE ASKED
HOWEVER OUR CONJECTURES WERE SET AT REST BY A VISIT FROM STAPLETON HIMSELF THAT VERY AFTERNOON HE HAD COME TO OFFER APOLOGIES FOR HIS RUDENESS OF THE MORNING AND AFTER A LONG PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH SIR HENRY IN HIS STUDY THE UPSHOT OF THEIR CONVERSATION
BUT FROM THE FIRST I JUST FELT THAT SHE WAS MADE FOR ME AND SHE TOO SHE WAS HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS WITH ME AND THAT I'LL SWEAR THERE'S A LIGHT IN A WOMAN'S EYES THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS BUT HE HAS NEVER LET US GET TOGETHER
IT HAD STRUCK ME THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME LOVE INTRIGUE WAS ON FOOT THAT WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR HIS STEALTHY MOVEMENTS AND ALSO FOR THE UNEASINESS OF HIS WIFE THE MAN IS A STRIKING LOOKING FELLOW VERY WELL EQUIPPED TO STEAL THE HEART OF A COUNTRY GIRL
HE WAS RUNNING WILDLY TOWARDS THEM HIS ABSURD NET DANGLING BEHIND HIM HE GESTICULATED AND ALMOST DANCED WITH EXCITEMENT IN FRONT OF THE LOVERS WHAT THE SCENE MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT STAPLETON WAS ABUSING SIR HENRY
COME SPEAK UP WHO IS YOUR CONFEDERATE OUT YONDER AND WHAT IS THIS CONSPIRACY THAT IS GOING ON THE MAN'S FACE BECAME OPENLY DEFIANT IT IS MY BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS I WILL NOT TELL THEN YOU LEAVE MY EMPLOYMENT RIGHT AWAY
AM SORRY TO INTRUDE BUT YOU HEARD HOW EARNESTLY HOLMES INSISTED THAT I SHOULD NOT LEAVE YOU AND ESPECIALLY THAT YOU SHOULD NOT GO ALONE UPON THE MOOR SIR HENRY PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WITH A PLEASANT SMILE MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE HOLMES WITH ALL HIS WISDOM
THE NEXT NIGHT WE LOWERED THE LAMP AND SAT SMOKING CIGARETTES WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST SOUND IT WAS INCREDIBLE HOW SLOWLY THE HOURS CRAWLED BY AND YET WE WERE HELPED THROUGH IT BY THE SAME SORT OF PATIENT INTEREST WHICH THE HUNTER MUST FEEL AS HE WATCHES THE TRAP
THAT'S THE TRUTH SIR SAID BARRYMORE I SAID THAT IT WAS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I COULD NOT TELL IT TO YOU BUT NOW YOU HAVE HEARD IT AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE WAS A PLOT IT WAS NOT AGAINST YOU
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM SANE ENOUGH UNTIL TODAY BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME THAT EITHER HE OR I OUGHT TO BE IN A STRAITJACKET WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME ANYHOW YOU'VE LIVED NEAR ME FOR SOME WEEKS WATSON TELL ME STRAIGHT NOW
VERY MUCH PUZZLED AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT TO FOLLOW THEM AND BREAK INTO THEIR INTIMATE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE AN OUTRAGE AND YET MY CLEAR DUTY WAS NEVER FOR AN INSTANT TO LET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT TO ACT THE SPY UPON A FRIEND WAS A HATEFUL TASK
I WAS DOING NO HARM SIR I WAS HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW AND WHY WERE YOU HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW DON'T ASK ME SIR HENRY DON'T ASK ME I GIVE YOU MY WORD SIR THAT IT IS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I CANNOT TELL IT
HIS AGITATION WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK AND THE SHADOWS SPRANG UP AND DOWN FROM THE SHAKING OF HIS CANDLE IT WAS THE WINDOW SIR I GO ROUND AT NIGHT TO SEE THAT THEY ARE FASTENED ON THE SECOND FLOOR YES SIR ALL THE WINDOWS
ISN'T THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE GREAT GRIMPEN MIRE YES IT IS WELL IT WAS UP THERE COME NOW WATSON DIDN'T YOU THINK YOURSELF THAT IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND I AM NOT A CHILD YOU NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS BECOME MUCH CLEARER AND IN SOME WAYS THEY HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED BUT I WILL TELL YOU ALL AND YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF BEFORE BREAKFAST ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING MY ADVENTURE
IT WAS STAPLETON WITH HIS BUTTERFLY NET HE WAS VERY MUCH CLOSER TO THE PAIR THAN I WAS AND HE APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN THEIR DIRECTION AT THIS INSTANT SIR HENRY SUDDENLY DREW MISS STAPLETON TO HIS SIDE HIS ARM WAS ROUND HER
HE HAS DONE NOTHING EXCEPT FOR MY SAKE AND BECAUSE I ASKED HIM SPEAK OUT THEN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
AND AN ABSOLUTE SILENCE CLOSED IN UPON US WE STOOD STRAINING OUR EARS BUT NOTHING CAME WATSON SAID THE BARONET IT WAS THE CRY OF A HOUND MY BLOOD RAN COLD IN MY VEINS
I SAY WATSON SAID THE BARONET WHAT WOULD HOLMES SAY TO THIS HOW ABOUT THAT HOUR OF DARKNESS IN WHICH THE POWER OF EVIL IS EXALTED AS IF IN ANSWER TO HIS WORDS THERE ROSE SUDDENLY OUT OF THE VAST GLOOM OF THE MOOR
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MIDDLE OF THAT PRAIRIE A FAIRLY SAFE PLACE FOR A MAN TO BE PRIVATE SAID HE BUT BY THUNDER
AND A MIGHTY POOR WOOING AT THAT WHERE HAD YOU ENGAGED A SEAT I WAS ON THAT HILL
SO THAT THIS THEORY SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SUPPORT IT THAT OPENING OF THE DOOR WHICH I HAD HEARD AFTER I HAD RETURNED TO MY ROOM MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD GONE OUT TO KEEP SOME CLANDESTINE APPOINTMENT SO I REASONED WITH MYSELF IN THE MORNING AND I TELL YOU THE DIRECTION OF MY SUSPICIONS
I NEVER HURT MAN OR WOMAN IN MY LIFE THAT I KNOW OF AND YET HE WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS LET ME TOUCH THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS DID HE SAY SO THAT AND A DEAL MORE I TELL YOU WATSON I'VE ONLY KNOWN HER THESE FEW WEEKS
BUT WHEN I CAME TO THINK THE MATTER OVER MY CONSCIENCE REPROACHED ME BITTERLY FOR HAVING ON ANY PRETEXT ALLOWED HIM TO GO OUT OF MY SIGHT
FROM CRIME TO CRIME HE SANK LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT IS ONLY THE MERCY OF GOD WHICH HAS SNATCHED HIM FROM THE SCAFFOLD BUT TO ME SIR HE WAS ALWAYS THE LITTLE CURLY HEADED BOY THAT I HAD NURSED AND PLAYED WITH AS AN ELDER SISTER WOULD
AND NOW I PASS ON TO ANOTHER THREAD WHICH I HAVE EXTRICATED OUT OF THE TANGLED SKEIN THE MYSTERY OF THE SOBS IN THE NIGHT OF THE TEAR STAINED FACE OF MISSUS BARRYMORE OF THE SECRET JOURNEY OF THE BUTLER TO THE WESTERN LATTICE WINDOW CONGRATULATE ME MY DEAR HOLMES
AFTER AN IRRESOLUTE GLANCE AT SIR HENRY WALKED OFF BY THE SIDE OF HER BROTHER THE NATURALIST'S ANGRY GESTURES SHOWED THAT THE LADY WAS INCLUDED IN HIS DISPLEASURE THE BARONET STOOD FOR A MINUTE LOOKING AFTER THEM
IF HE HAD NOT BEEN HER BROTHER I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER HOW TO ANSWER HIM AS IT WAS I TOLD HIM THAT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HIS SISTER WERE SUCH AS I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF AND THAT I HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT HONOUR ME BY BECOMING MY WIFE THAT SEEMED TO MAKE THE MATTER NO BETTER
LOOKING AT ME IN A CURIOUS WAY THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU ARE GOING ON THE MOOR SAID I YES I AM
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THAT TERRIBLE PLACE IT WAS NOT THE CONVICT THIS MAN WAS FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE LATTER HAD DISAPPEARED BESIDES HE WAS A MUCH TALLER MAN WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE I POINTED HIM OUT TO THE BARONET
A LUCKY LONG SHOT OF MY REVOLVER MIGHT HAVE CRIPPLED HIM BUT I HAD BROUGHT IT ONLY TO DEFEND MYSELF IF ATTACKED AND NOT TO SHOOT AN UNARMED MAN WHO WAS RUNNING AWAY WE WERE BOTH SWIFT RUNNERS AND IN FAIRLY GOOD TRAINING
THE BARONET HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE ARCHITECT WHO PREPARED THE PLANS FOR SIR CHARLES AND WITH A CONTRACTOR FROM LONDON SO THAT WE MAY EXPECT GREAT CHANGES TO BEGIN HERE SOON
AND ITS STRANGE INHABITANTS REMAINS AS INSCRUTABLE AS EVER
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME FURTHER PROOF OF IT TODAY WE MEAN TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PRINCETOWN PEOPLE WHERE THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR THEIR MISSING MAN
THE SAME THOUGHT HAD CROSSED MY OWN MIND IT WAS NOT AS IF THE BARRYMORES HAD TAKEN US INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEIR SECRET HAD BEEN FORCED FROM THEM THE MAN WAS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY
AND YET THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE DOES NOT RUN QUITE AS SMOOTHLY AS ONE WOULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXPECT TODAY FOR EXAMPLE ITS SURFACE WAS BROKEN BY A VERY UNEXPECTED RIPPLE WHICH HAS CAUSED OUR FRIEND CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY AND ANNOYANCE
AND IT WAS ONLY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I SAW A CHANCE OF HAVING A FEW WORDS WITH HER ALONE SHE WAS GLAD TO MEET ME BUT WHEN SHE DID IT WAS NOT LOVE THAT SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME TALK ABOUT IT EITHER IF SHE COULD HAVE STOPPED IT
I WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR WHAT TO DO
OR THE FELLOW MAY HAVE HAD SOME OTHER REASON FOR THINKING THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL BUT I COULD READ HIS FEARS UPON HIS WICKED FACE ANY INSTANT HE MIGHT DASH OUT THE LIGHT AND VANISH IN THE DARKNESS I SPRANG FORWARD THEREFORE AND SIR HENRY DID THE SAME
BUT HER BROTHER WAS WELL UP TO THE FRONT DID YOU SEE HIM COME OUT ON US YES I DID DID HE EVER STRIKE YOU AS BEING CRAZY THIS BROTHER OF HERS I CAN'T SAY THAT HE EVER DID I DARE SAY NOT
LOOK HERE BARRYMORE SAID SIR HENRY STERNLY WE HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO HAVE THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU SO IT WILL SAVE YOU TROUBLE TO TELL IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER COME NOW NO LIES WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THAT WINDOW THE FELLOW LOOKED AT US IN A HELPLESS WAY
AND LEAVE YOU TO SELECT FOR YOURSELF THOSE WHICH WILL BE OF MOST SERVICE TO YOU IN HELPING YOU TO YOUR CONCLUSIONS WE ARE CERTAINLY MAKING SOME PROGRESS SO FAR AS THE BARRYMORES GO WE HAVE FOUND THE MOTIVE OF THEIR ACTIONS
BUT IT WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY THE BARONET'S NERVES WERE STILL QUIVERING FROM THAT CRY WHICH RECALLED THE DARK STORY OF HIS FAMILY AND HE WAS NOT IN THE MOOD FOR FRESH ADVENTURES HE HAD NOT SEEN THIS LONELY MAN UPON THE TOR
ANY NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE OUR NEIGHBOURS THE STAPLETONS MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HIM AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT OF THIS WHICH MADE SIR HENRY SO KEEN UPON THE ADVENTURE I WILL COME SAID I THEN GET YOUR REVOLVER AND PUT ON YOUR BOOTS THE SOONER WE START THE BETTER
WHO OFFERED EXPLANATIONS WHICH BECAME MORE ANGRY AS THE OTHER REFUSED TO ACCEPT THEM THE LADY STOOD BY IN HAUGHTY SILENCE FINALLY STAPLETON TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND BECKONED IN A PEREMPTORY WAY TO HIS SISTER WHO
AND I SAW HER MAKING QUICK LITTLE MOVEMENTS OF HER HANDS AS IF SHE WERE VERY EARNEST IN WHAT SHE WAS SAYING WHILE HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND ONCE OR TWICE SHOOK HIS HEAD IN STRONG DISSENT I STOOD AMONG THE ROCKS WATCHING THEM
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT DO YOU WATSON NO NO AND YET IT WAS ONE THING TO LAUGH ABOUT IT IN LONDON
AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE THE FIGURE WAS THAT OF A TALL THIN MAN HE STOOD WITH HIS LEGS A LITTLE SEPARATED HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS HEAD BOWED AS IF HE WERE BROODING OVER THAT ENORMOUS WILDERNESS OF PEAT AND GRANITE WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM
THERE OUTLINED AS BLACK AS AN EBONY STATUE ON THAT SHINING BACKGROUND I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN UPON THE TOR DO NOT THINK THAT IT WAS A DELUSION HOLMES I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN ANYTHING MORE CLEARLY
AND A LADY WAS BY HIS SIDE WHO COULD ONLY BE MISS STAPLETON IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS ALREADY AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM AND THAT THEY HAD MET BY APPOINTMENT THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY ALONG IN DEEP CONVERSATION
HE ASKED WHO THE FOLK ON THE COUNTRYSIDE OH THEY ARE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHY SHOULD YOU MIND WHAT THEY CALL IT TELL ME WATSON WHAT DO THEY SAY OF IT I HESITATED BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION THEY SAY IT IS THE CRY OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
AND TELL ME THAT I HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED YOU AS AN AGENT
WITH A SHARP HISS OF HIS BREATH AND STOOD LIVID AND TREMBLING BEFORE US HIS DARK EYES GLARING OUT OF THE WHITE MASK OF HIS FACE WERE FULL OF HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT AS HE GAZED FROM SIR HENRY TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE BARRYMORE
AND I TOLD HIM ALL THAT I HAD SEEN HE WAS LESS SURPRISED THAN I HAD EXPECTED I KNEW THAT BARRYMORE WALKED ABOUT NIGHTS AND I HAD A MIND TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT SAID HE TWO OR THREE TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIS STEPS IN THE PASSAGE COMING AND GOING
AND THEN WE KNEW THAT WE WERE INDEED VERY CLOSE A GUTTERING CANDLE WAS STUCK IN A CREVICE OF THE ROCKS WHICH FLANKED IT ON EACH SIDE SO AS TO KEEP THE WIND FROM IT AND ALSO TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING VISIBLE SAVE IN THE DIRECTION OF BASKERVILLE HALL
BUT NO SOUND OF ANY SORT DID WE HEAR EXCEPT THE CHIMING CLOCK UPON THE STAIRS IT WAS A MOST MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND ENDED BY EACH OF US FALLING ASLEEP IN OUR CHAIRS FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT DISCOURAGED AND WE DETERMINED TO TRY AGAIN
THERE ARE PRETTY CLEAR SIGNS THAT THIS WILL NOT BE WANTING IF THE LADY IS WILLING FOR I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A MAN MORE INFATUATED WITH A WOMAN THAN HE IS WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOUR MISS STAPLETON
BUT WE SOON FOUND THAT WE HAD NO CHANCE OF OVERTAKING HIM WE SAW HIM FOR A LONG TIME IN THE MOONLIGHT UNTIL HE WAS ONLY A SMALL SPECK MOVING SWIFTLY AMONG THE BOULDERS UPON THE SIDE OF A DISTANT HILL WE RAN AND RAN UNTIL WE WERE COMPLETELY BLOWN
EXACTLY AS I HAD SEEN HIM TWO NIGHTS BEFORE WE HAD ARRANGED NO PLAN OF CAMPAIGN BUT THE BARONET IS A MAN TO WHOM THE MOST DIRECT WAY IS ALWAYS THE MOST NATURAL HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND AS HE DID SO BARRYMORE SPRANG UP FROM THE WINDOW
THE LIGHT BENEATH HIM WAS REFLECTED IN HIS SMALL CUNNING EYES WHICH PEERED FIERCELY
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT BARRYMORE SINCE ONLY THIS WINDOW WOULD SERVE THE PURPOSE MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY UPON THE MOOR THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK SO THAT I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE HOW HE COULD HAVE HOPED TO SEE ANYONE
AND WE SHALL TALK FURTHER ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE GONE WE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AGAIN SIR HENRY HAD FLUNG IT OPEN AND THE COLD NIGHT WIND BEAT IN UPON OUR FACES
WITH THAT I OFFERED IN AS MANY WORDS TO MARRY HER
AND HE IS WAITING THIS VILLAIN BESIDE THAT CANDLE BY THUNDER WATSON
BUT THE SPACE BETWEEN US GREW EVER WIDER FINALLY WE STOPPED AND SAT PANTING ON TWO ROCKS WHILE WE WATCHED HIM DISAPPEARING IN THE DISTANCE AND IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT THERE OCCURRED A MOST STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED THING
NO NO SIR NO NOT AGAINST YOU IT WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE AND MISSUS BARRYMORE PALER AND MORE HORROR STRUCK THAN HER HUSBAND WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR HER BULKY FIGURE IN A SHAWL AND SKIRT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMIC
IF SHE HAD TO LEAVE HIM HE HAD RATHER IT WAS TO A NEIGHBOUR LIKE MYSELF THAN TO ANYONE ELSE BUT IN ANY CASE IT WAS A BLOW TO HIM AND IT WOULD TAKE HIM SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD PREPARE HIMSELF TO MEET IT HE WOULD WITHDRAW ALL OPPOSITION UPON HIS PART
OVER THE ROCKS IN THE CREVICE OF WHICH THE CANDLE BURNED THERE WAS THRUST OUT AN EVIL YELLOW FACE A TERRIBLE ANIMAL FACE ALL SEAMED AND SCORED WITH VILE PASSIONS FOUL WITH MIRE WITH A BRISTLING BEARD AND HUNG WITH MATTED HAIR
WE STUMBLED SLOWLY ALONG IN THE DARKNESS WITH THE BLACK LOOM OF THE CRAGGY HILLS AROUND US AND THE YELLOW SPECK OF LIGHT BURNING STEADILY IN FRONT THERE IS NOTHING SO DECEPTIVE AS THE DISTANCE OF A LIGHT UPON A PITCH DARK NIGHT
BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE WAS STRAINING AWAY FROM HIM WITH HER FACE AVERTED HE STOOPED HIS HEAD TO HERS AND SHE RAISED ONE HAND AS IF IN PROTEST NEXT MOMENT I SAW THEM SPRING APART AND TURN HURRIEDLY ROUND STAPLETON WAS THE CAUSE OF THE INTERRUPTION
HOWEVER THE MAN IS FORTUNATELY RATHER DEAF AND HE WAS ENTIRELY PREOCCUPIED IN THAT WHICH HE WAS DOING WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE DOOR AND PEEPED THROUGH WE FOUND HIM CROUCHING AT THE WINDOW CANDLE IN HAND
WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY WITNESS OF THEIR INTERVIEW A WISP OF GREEN FLOATING IN THE AIR CAUGHT MY EYE AND ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS CARRIED ON A STICK BY A MAN WHO WAS MOVING AMONG THE BROKEN GROUND
I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR STANDING BY YOUR OWN WIFE FORGET WHAT I HAVE SAID
ALL THESE THINGS HAVE BY ONE NIGHT'S WORK BEEN THOROUGHLY CLEARED I HAVE SAID BY ONE NIGHT'S WORK BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS BY TWO NIGHTS WORK FOR ON THE FIRST WE DREW ENTIRELY BLANK I SAT UP WITH SIR HENRY IN HIS ROOMS UNTIL NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
WE MUST TAKE OUR CHANCE OF THAT WE'LL SIT UP IN MY ROOM TONIGHT AND WAIT UNTIL HE PASSES SIR HENRY RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH PLEASURE AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAILED THE ADVENTURE AS A RELIEF TO HIS SOMEWHAT QUIET LIFE UPON THE MOOR
KEENLY ON THE ALERT ONCE MORE WE HAD HEARD THE CREAK OF A STEP IN THE PASSAGE VERY STEALTHILY WE HEARD IT PASS ALONG UNTIL IT DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE THEN THE BARONET GENTLY OPENED HIS DOOR AND WE SET OUT IN PURSUIT
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CONVICT SCREAMED OUT A CURSE AT US AND HURLED A ROCK WHICH SPLINTERED UP AGAINST THE BOULDER WHICH HAD SHELTERED US I CAUGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF HIS SHORT SQUAT STRONGLY BUILT FIGURE AS HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND TURNED TO RUN
WE TOOK HIM IN AND FED HIM AND CARED FOR HIM THEN YOU RETURNED SIR AND MY BROTHER THOUGHT HE WOULD BE SAFER ON THE MOOR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE UNTIL THE HUE AND CRY WAS OVER SO HE LAY IN HIDING THERE BUT EVERY SECOND NIGHT WE MADE SURE
AND HE RECOGNIZED HOW FOOLISH AND HOW SELFISH IT WAS
WAS THAT THE BREACH IS QUITE HEALED AND THAT WE ARE TO DINE AT MERRIPIT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY AS A SIGN OF IT I DON'T SAY NOW THAT HE ISN'T A CRAZY MAN SAID SIR HENRY I CAN'T FORGET THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE RAN AT ME THIS MORNING
BUT IN THE INSTANT DURING WHICH I HAD TURNED TO GRASP HIS ARM THE MAN WAS GONE THERE WAS THE SHARP PINNACLE OF GRANITE STILL CUTTING THE LOWER EDGE OF THE MOON BUT ITS PEAK BORE NO TRACE OF THAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS FIGURE
AND I'LL OWE YOU MORE THAN EVER I CAN HOPE TO PAY I TRIED ONE OR TWO EXPLANATIONS BUT INDEED I WAS COMPLETELY PUZZLED MYSELF OUR FRIEND'S TITLE HIS FORTUNE HIS AGE HIS CHARACTER AND HIS APPEARANCE ARE ALL IN HIS FAVOUR AND I KNOW NOTHING AGAINST HIM
SHALL WE TURN BACK NO BY THUNDER WE HAVE COME OUT TO GET OUR MAN AND WE WILL DO IT WE AFTER THE CONVICT AND A HELL HOUND AS LIKELY AS NOT AFTER US COME ON WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH IF ALL THE FIENDS OF THE PIT WERE LOOSE UPON THE MOOR
STRIDENT WILD AND MENACING THE BARONET CAUGHT MY SLEEVE AND HIS FACE GLIMMERED WHITE THROUGH THE DARKNESS MY GOD WHAT'S THAT WATSON I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SOUND THEY HAVE ON THE MOOR I HEARD IT ONCE BEFORE IT DIED AWAY
STILL I COULD SEE NO BETTER COURSE THAN TO OBSERVE HIM FROM THE HILL AND TO CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE BY CONFESSING TO HIM AFTERWARDS WHAT I HAD DONE IT IS TRUE THAT IF ANY SUDDEN DANGER HAD THREATENED HIM I WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO BE OF USE
AND SHOT ONE SINGLE YELLOW BEAM ACROSS THE GLOOM OF THE CORRIDOR WE SHUFFLED CAUTIOUSLY TOWARDS IT TRYING EVERY PLANK BEFORE WE DARED TO PUT OUR WHOLE WEIGHT UPON IT WE HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION OF LEAVING OUR BOOTS BEHIND US BUT EVEN SO
THE NIGHT AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF DAMP AND DECAY NOW AND AGAIN THE MOON PEEPED OUT FOR AN INSTANT BUT CLOUDS WERE DRIVING OVER THE FACE OF THE SKY
VERY GOOD SIR IF I MUST I MUST AND YOU GO IN DISGRACE BY THUNDER YOU MAY WELL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YOUR FAMILY HAS LIVED WITH MINE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS UNDER THIS ROOF
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT ME FROM MAKING A GOOD HUSBAND TO A WOMAN THAT I LOVED I SHOULD SAY NOT HE CAN'T OBJECT TO MY WORLDLY POSITION SO IT MUST BE MYSELF THAT HE HAS THIS DOWN ON WHAT HAS HE AGAINST ME
CALLING OF A STRANGE BIRD NO NO IT WAS A HOUND MY GOD CAN THERE BE SOME TRUTH IN ALL THESE STORIES
WAS OF THE SAME BLOOD AS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR MY NAME WAS SELDEN AND HE IS MY YOUNGER BROTHER WE HUMOURED HIM TOO MUCH WHEN HE WAS A LAD AND GAVE HIM HIS OWN WAY IN EVERYTHING
AS THE FELLOW MAY PUT OUT HIS LIGHT AND BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES WE WERE OUTSIDE THE DOOR STARTING UPON OUR EXPEDITION WE HURRIED THROUGH THE DARK SHRUBBERY
IF IT CONCERNED NO ONE BUT MYSELF I WOULD NOT TRY TO KEEP IT FROM YOU A SUDDEN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME AND I TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE TREMBLING HAND OF THE BUTLER
AND I ANSWERED HIM RATHER MORE HOTLY THAN I SHOULD PERHAPS CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS STANDING BY SO IT ENDED BY HIS GOING OFF WITH HER AS YOU SAW
THE LIGHT STILL BURNED STEADILY IN FRONT ARE YOU ARMED I ASKED I HAVE A HUNTING CROP WE MUST CLOSE IN ON HIM RAPIDLY FOR HE IS SAID TO BE A DESPERATE FELLOW WE SHALL TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE AND HAVE HIM AT OUR MERCY BEFORE HE CAN RESIST
BASKERVILLE HALL OCTOBER FIFTEENTH MY DEAR HOLMES IF I WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT MUCH NEWS DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF MY MISSION
AND THE GLEAM OF THE ROCK ON EACH SIDE OF IT WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW WHISPERED SIR HENRY WAIT HERE HE MUST BE NEAR HIS LIGHT LET US SEE IF WE CAN GET A GLIMPSE OF HIM THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN WE BOTH SAW HIM
AND YET I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE POSITION WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WHICH I COULD DO OUR FRIEND SIR HENRY AND THE LADY HAD HALTED ON THE PATH AND WERE STANDING DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR CONVERSATION
AT THE SAME MOMENT BY A LUCKY CHANCE THE MOON BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS WE RUSHED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL AND THERE WAS OUR MAN RUNNING WITH GREAT SPEED DOWN THE OTHER SIDE SPRINGING OVER THE STONES IN HIS WAY WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A MOUNTAIN GOAT
WE HAD RISEN FROM OUR ROCKS AND WERE TURNING TO GO HOME HAVING ABANDONED THE HOPELESS CHASE THE MOON WAS LOW UPON THE RIGHT AND THE JAGGED PINNACLE OF A GRANITE TOR STOOD UP AGAINST THE LOWER CURVE OF ITS SILVER DISC
HIS HEAD HANGING THE VERY PICTURE OF DEJECTION WHAT ALL THIS MEANT I COULD NOT IMAGINE
WERE IT NOT FOR THE INTENSITY OF FEELING UPON HER FACE WE HAVE TO GO ELIZA THIS IS THE END OF IT YOU CAN PACK OUR THINGS SAID THE BUTLER OH JOHN JOHN HAVE I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS IT IS MY DOING SIR HENRY ALL MINE
BUT WHEN HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES THAT IT WAS REALLY SO AND THAT SHE MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IT GAVE HIM SUCH A SHOCK THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE SAID OR DID
HE GROANED AND WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS A HOUND IT WAS HE SAID AT LAST BUT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM MILES AWAY OVER YONDER I THINK IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHENCE IT CAME IT ROSE AND FELL WITH THE WIND
AND IF THERE WAS AN ANSWER MY HUSBAND TOOK OUT SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO HIM EVERY DAY WE HOPED THAT HE WAS GONE BUT AS LONG AS HE WAS THERE WE COULD NOT DESERT HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE TRUTH AS I AM AN HONEST CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE IS BLAME IN THE MATTER
A BOULDER OF GRANITE CONCEALED OUR APPROACH AND CROUCHING BEHIND IT WE GAZED OVER IT AT THE SIGNAL LIGHT IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE THIS SINGLE CANDLE BURNING THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOOR WITH NO SIGN OF LIFE NEAR IT JUST THE ONE STRAIGHT YELLOW FLAME
WHO DOES NOT PERCEIVE HOW LAUGHABLE IT IS TO SEE A LADY WHO IS CLOTHED IN SATIN LACE OR VELVET LABORIOUSLY TRAVELLING IN THE DUST OR MUD
MUCH MORE THEREFORE ALL THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS WHICH ARE THE HIGHEST ARE ACTIVE ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
BUT THAT IT IS ITS VIRTUE AND POWER
CONSIDERATION IS NOT ACQUIRED BY WORDS AN ARTICLE SO PRECIOUS DEMANDS A REAL VALUE IT DEMANDS ALSO THE ASSISTANCE OF DISCRETION
TO SUPPOSE THAT GREAT HEAT OF WEATHER WILL AUTHORISE THIS DISORDER OF THE TOILET AND WILL PERMIT US TO GO IN SLIPPERS OR WITH OUR LEGS AND ARMS BARE OR TO TAKE NONCHALANT OR IMPROPER ATTITUDES
TO FINISH OUR INSTRUCTIONS RELATIVE TO THE TOILET IT ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS IT IS SUPERLATIVELY RIDICULOUS FOR A LADY TO GO ON FOOT
AN OUTER GARMENT OVER THE COAT ESPECIALLY ONE OF SILK IS LEFT FOR MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE IT ONLY BELONGS TO SEPTUAGENARIANS AND ECCLESIASTICS TO WEAR DOUBLETS OR WADDED OUTER COATS
AND THOSE IN THE PROFESSION OF THE LAW SHOULD AVOID HAVING A FASHIONABLE OR MILITARY COSTUME WHICH IS GENERALLY ADOPTED BY STUDENTS COMMERCIAL MEN
CERTAIN FASHIONABLES SEEK TO GAIN A KIND OF REPUTATION BY THE ODD CHOICE OF THEIR ATTIRE AND BY THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEIZE UPON THE FIRST CAPRICES OF THE FASHIONS
NOW THE INTELLECT IS A PASSIVE POWER IN REGARD TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSAL BEING WHILE THE VEGETATIVE POWER IS ACTIVE IN REGARD TO SOME PARTICULAR THING NAMELY THE BODY AS UNITED TO THE SOUL
I ANSWER THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SHOWN
PLACES THE INTELLIGENCE AND WILL IN THE MIND THEREFORE THE MIND AND INTELLECT OF MAN IS OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND NOT A POWER THEREOF
SAYS THAT THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS A SUBSTANCE IN ACTUAL BEING BUT NOTHING CAN BE IN POTENTIALITY AND IN ACT WITH REGARD TO THE SAME THING
VARY YOUR TOILET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR FEAR THAT IDLERS AND MALIGNANT WITS WHO ARE ALWAYS A MAJORITY IN THE WORLD SHOULD AMUSE THEMSELVES BY MAKING YOUR DRESS THE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PERSON
SAYS OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT THAT IT DOES NOT SOMETIMES UNDERSTAND AND SOMETIMES NOT UNDERSTAND BUT OUR SOUL DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES IT UNDERSTANDS SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
WE MUST GIVE DIRECTIONS THAT WE ARE NOT AT HOME ON THE OTHER HAND TO THINK THAT COLD AND RAINY WEATHER EXCUSES LIKE LIBERTIES IS EQUALLY AN ERROR YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE IN THE HABIT OF WEARING LARGE SOCKS
FOR THE INTELLECT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME AS THE MIND NOW THE MIND IS NOT A POWER OF THE SOUL BUT THE ESSENCE FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
AND FOR NO OTHER SUCH AS RICH BLOND CAPS ORNAMENTED WITH FLOWERS
IS IN A WAY TO BE PASSIVE TAKING PASSION IN THE THIRD SENSE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE INTELLECT IS A PASSIVE POWER
WE MUST THEREFORE ASSIGN ON THE PART OF THE INTELLECT SOME POWER TO MAKE THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BY ABSTRACTION OF THE SPECIES FROM MATERIAL CONDITIONS AND SUCH IS THE NECESSITY FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
THAT THE INTELLECT IS A SUBSTANCE AND IN THIS SENSE ALSO AUGUSTINE SAYS THAT THE MIND IS SPIRIT AND ESSENCE
SHE SHOULD PRETEND NOT TO PERCEIVE HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME HASTEN A LITTLE HER STEP TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE DAY A YOUNG LADY WOULD CONDUCT HERSELF IN AN UNBECOMING MANNER IF SHE SHOULD GO ALONE
SENSIBLE THINGS ARE FOUND IN ACT OUTSIDE THE SOUL AND HENCE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE SENSE WHEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE NUTRITIVE PART ALL THE POWERS ARE ACTIVE
LADIES OUGHT TO ADOPT IN SUMMER LIGHT GARMENTS AND DELICATE COLORS
BECAUSE HIS WHOLE POWER CONSISTS IN THIS BUT THE SOUL HAS MANY OTHER POWERS SUCH AS THE SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIVE POWERS AND THEREFORE THE COMPARISON FAILS
IN REGARD TO CHASTITY THERE EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY OF GOOD CONDUCT A MULTITUDE OF CARES AND PRECAUTIONS WHICH HOWEVER MINUTE AND EMBARRASSING AT TIMES OUGHT NEVER TO BE NEGLECTED
IF THE AGENT PRE EXIST IT MAY WELL HAPPEN THAT ITS LIKENESS IS RECEIVED VARIOUSLY INTO VARIOUS THINGS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DISPOSITIONS BUT IF THE AGENT DOES NOT PRE EXIST
BUT THEY ARE UNITED IN THE MIND FOR AUGUSTINE
THIS CUSTOM IS IN THE WORST TASTE WHEN YOU GO TO SEE ANY ONE YOU CANNOT DISPENSE WITH TAKING OFF YOUR SOCKS OR CLOGS BEFORE YOU ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE ROOM
THEY ARE OBTAINED BY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR OBLIGATIONS OF FAMILY AND OF OUR PROFESSION BY OUR PROBITY AND GOOD MANNERS BY OUR FORTUNE AND SITUATION IN SOCIETY
UNLESS SHE GOES THERE TO STUDY OR WORK AS AN ARTIST A LADY OUGHT TO HAVE A MODEST AND MEASURED GAIT TOO GREAT HURRY INJURES THE GRACE WHICH OUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE HER
TO MAKE THE SPECIES ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
THAT IS SAD BUT ALSO HE THAT IS JOYFUL OR WHATEVER WAY HE BE ALTERED OR MOVED THIRDLY IN A WIDE SENSE A THING IS SAID TO BE PASSIVE
THE RIGOROUS SIMPLICITY OF THE DRESS OF MEN ESTABLISHES BUT VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT OF YOUNG AND OLD THE LATTER HOWEVER OUGHT TO CHOOSE GRAVE COLORS NOT TO FOLLOW THE FASHIONS TOO CLOSELY
SO IS OUR INTELLECT TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE BUT BECAUSE SENSE IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS SENSIBLE THE SENSE IS NOT SAID TO BE ACTIVE BUT ONLY PASSIVE THEREFORE
FOR COLOR OF ITS OWN NATURE MOVES THE LUMINOUS MEDIUM BUT IN THE OPERATION OF THE INTELLECT THERE IS NO APPOINTED MEDIUM THAT HAS TO BE BROUGHT INTO ACT THEREFORE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
BUT THE INTELLECTUAL POWER RESULTS FROM THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT A PASSIVE POWER
IT IS WELL TO IMPOSE UPON YOURSELF A RULE TO BE DRESSED AT SOME PARTICULAR HOUR THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE SINCE OCCUPATIONS WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES TO HINDER YOUR BEING READY FOR THE DAY AND YOU WILL EASILY ACQUIRE THE HABIT OF THIS
AS IN EVERY NATURE SO IN THE SOUL IS THERE SOMETHING BY WHICH IT BECOMES ALL THINGS AND SOMETHING BY WHICH IT MAKES ALL THINGS THEREFORE WE MUST ADMIT AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
FURTHER IF WE SAY THAT ALSO IN THE SENSES THERE IS SOMETHING ACTIVE SUCH AS LIGHT ON THE CONTRARY LIGHT IS REQUIRED FOR SIGHT INASMUCH AS IT MAKES THE MEDIUM TO BE ACTUALLY LUMINOUS
THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AS SOON AS MAY BE IN THIS DRESS WE CAN RECEIVE ONLY INTIMATE FRIENDS OR PERSONS WHO CALL UPON URGENT OR INDISPENSABLE BUSINESS EVEN THEN WE OUGHT TO OFFER SOME APOLOGY FOR IT
IS NOT PASSIVE EXCEPT IN THE THIRD SENSE
ITS IMMATERIAL NATURE SUFFICES FOR FORMS TO BE RECEIVED INTO IT IMMATERIALLY NOW A FORM IS INTELLIGIBLE IN ACT FROM THE VERY FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL THEREFORE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT
SINCE OUR INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IT SEEMS THAT WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS ACTIVE BUT ONLY THAT IT IS PASSIVE
LADIES TO WHOM THE ADVICE CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS PARTICULARLY ADDRESSED KNOW HOW THE SHADOW OF SUSPICION WITHERS AND TORMENTS THEM THIS SHADOW IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID AT ALL HAZARDS
ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER ASSIGNS THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTY AS A POWER OF THE SOUL
IF THEREFORE THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WHICH IS IN POTENTIALITY TO ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVE INTELLECT TO BE ALSO SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
WHEN OPERATION ITSELF IS ITS BEING FOR AS POWER IS TO OPERATION AS ITS ACT SO IS THE ESSENCE TO BEING BUT IN GOD ALONE HIS ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING IS HIS VERY BEING
AND IN LIKE MANNER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS SOMETIMES CALLED INTELLECT AS FROM ITS CHIEF POWER AND THUS WE READ
IF IT SEEMS THE RESULT OF NEGLIGENCE AND SLOVENLINESS IT IS UNPARDONABLE PARTICULARLY IN LADIES WHOSE DRESS SEEMS LESS DESIGNED FOR CLOTHING THAN ORNAMENT
WHICH IS AN ACTIVE POWER IT FOLLOWS THAT A MAN WOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN HE WISHED WHICH IS CLEARLY FALSE THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
WHEREAS IN THE SENSITIVE PART ALL ARE PASSIVE BUT IN THE INTELLECTUAL PART THERE IS SOMETHING ACTIVE AND SOMETHING PASSIVE
THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
FOR A LADY A SMALL MUSLIN CAP BONNET DE PERCALE A CAMISOLE OR COMMON ROBE IT IS WELL THAT A HALF CORSET SHOULD PRECEDE THE FULL CORSET WHICH LAST IS USED ONLY WHEN ONE IS DRESSED
SO THAT WE MUST BEGIN BY FULFILLING EXACTLY OUR DUTIES TOWARDS RELATIONS BUT WE MUST BEWARE OF MAKING PUBLIC THOSE PETTY QUARRELS AND LITTLE DIFFERENCES OF INTEREST OF ILL HUMOR OR OPINION
TEN WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE IS DISTINCT FROM THE INTELLECT ELEVEN WHETHER THE SPECULATIVE AND PRACTICAL INTELLECT ARE DISTINCT POWERS TWELVE
FURTHER A SUBSTANCE IS INTELLECTUAL BY THE FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL BUT THE SOUL IS IMMATERIAL THROUGH ITS ESSENCE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE SOUL MUST BE INTELLECTUAL THROUGH ITS ESSENCE
FOR PLATO SUPPOSED THAT THE FORMS OF NATURAL THINGS SUBSISTED APART FROM MATTER AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THEY ARE INTELLIGIBLE SINCE A THING IS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE FROM THE VERY FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL
THE DISPOSITION OF THE RECIPIENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER NOW THE INTELLIGIBLE IN ACT IS NOT SOMETHING EXISTING IN NATURE IF WE CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THINGS SENSIBLE WHICH DO NOT SUBSIST APART FROM MATTER
ALL THE DETAILS OF WHICH WE CANNOT GIVE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR MULTIPLICITY AND THE NUMEROUS MODIFICATION OF FASHION WE SHALL ONLY SAY THAT LADIES GENERALLY SHOULD MAKE THESE CALLS IN THE DRESS WHICH THEY WEAR AT HOME
MOREOVER WHATEVER BE THE OPULENCE WHICH YOU ENJOY LUXURY ENCROACHES SO MUCH UPON IT THAT NO RICHES ARE ABLE TO SATISFY ITS DEMANDS BUT FORTUNATELY PROPRIETY ALWAYS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASON
THAT TO UNDERSTAND IS IN A WAY TO BE PASSIVE I ANSWER THAT TO BE PASSIVE MAY BE TAKEN IN THREE WAYS FIRSTLY IN ITS MOST STRICT SENSE
MIND AND SPIRIT ARE NOT RELATIVE THINGS BUT DENOMINATE THE ESSENCE THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
WE MUST BEWARE OF A SHOAL IN THIS CASE FREQUENTLY A YOUNG LADY OF SMALL FORTUNE DESIRING TO APPEAR DECENTLY IN ANY SPLENDID ASSEMBLY MAKES SACRIFICES IN ORDER TO EMBELLISH HER MODEST ATTIRE
WHICH BELONG TO PRIMARY MATTER BUT IN THE THIRD SENSE PASSION IS IN ANYTHING WHICH IS REDUCED FROM POTENTIALITY TO ACT
BUT THE INTELLECT WHICH IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE AND WHICH FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE CALLS THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT
SENSE IS SOMETIMES TAKEN FOR THE POWER AND SOMETIMES FOR THE SENSITIVE SOUL FOR THE SENSITIVE SOUL TAKES ITS NAME FROM ITS CHIEF POWER WHICH IS SENSE
AND THOSE WHO ACT IN DEFIANCE OF THESE RATIONAL MARKS OF PROPRIETY MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE POSSESSED OF AN UNRESTRAINED LOVE OF LUXURY AND DEPRIVE THEMSELVES OF THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING THESE ORNAMENTS FROM THE HAND OF THE MAN OF THEIR CHOICE
FURTHER IF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL IT MUST BE A POWER FOR IT IS NEITHER A PASSION NOR A HABIT
HAVE FREQUENTLY GIVEN TO THESE ATTENTIONS THE NAMES OF COQUETRY AMBITION OR FOLLY THIS IS A STILL STRONGER REASON WHY WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS
HE WAS THE TRUE LIGHT THAT ENLIGHTENETH EVERY MAN COMING INTO THIS WORLD THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN THE SOUL
AND CONSEQUENTLY AN OBLIGATION A MARRIED LADY WELL EDUCATED WILL DISREGARD IT IF CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT HER BEING ABLE WITHOUT TROUBLE TO FIND A CONDUCTOR IF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHES TO ACCOMPANY YOU HIMSELF
GENTLEMEN MAY CALL IN AN OUTSIDE COAT IN BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AS WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS IN SHORT THIS DRESS IS PROPER FOR GENTLEMEN'S VISITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
BUT THE HUMAN INTELLECT WHICH IS THE LOWEST IN THE ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE AND MOST REMOTE FROM THE PERFECTION OF THE DIVINE INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY WITH REGARD TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE
THE APPETITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL POWERS ARE DIFFERENT GENERA OF POWERS IN THE SOUL BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENT FORMALITIES OF THEIR OBJECTS BUT THE APPETITIVE POWER AGREES PARTLY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL POWER
FURTHER DIFFERENT GENERA OF THE SOUL'S POWERS ARE NOT UNITED IN SOME ONE POWER BUT ONLY IN THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
THE HAIR PAPERS WHICH CANNOT BE REMOVED ON RISING BECAUSE THE HAIR WOULD NOT KEEP IN CURL TILL EVENING SHOULD BE CONCEALED UNDER A BANDEAU OF LACE OR OF THE HAIR
THAT POWERFUL MEANS OF OBTAINING CONSIDERATION BY ITS ELEVATED AND RELIGIOUS NATURE IS NOT WITHIN OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS
IT IS NECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS A POWER OF THE SOUL AND NOT THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL FOR THEN ALONE THE ESSENCE OF THAT WHICH OPERATES IS THE IMMEDIATE PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
SHE SHOULD TAKE GOOD CARE NOT TO ANSWER THEM A WORD IF THEY PERSIST SHE SHOULD TELL THEM IN A BRIEF AND FIRM THOUGH POLITE TONE THAT SHE DESIRES TO BE LEFT TO HERSELF IF A MAN FOLLOW HER IN SILENCE
IT IS MORE PROPER THAT OLD PERSONS SHOULD SHOW THEIR WHITE AND NOBLE HEADS OLD LADIES
I ANSWER THAT ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF PLATO THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN ACTIVE INTELLECT IN ORDER TO MAKE THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BUT PERHAPS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INTELLECTUAL LIGHT TO THE INTELLECT
SHOULD AT LEAST AVOID HAIR TOO THICK OR TOO FULL OF CURLS IF THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR RIDICULOUS AND CLOTHED IN A MANNER DISAGREEABLE OR OFFENSIVE
WHEN FROM A THING IS TAKEN SOMETHING WHICH BELONGS TO IT BY VIRTUE EITHER OF ITS NATURE OR OF ITS PROPER INCLINATION AS WHEN WATER LOSES COOLNESS BY HEATING AND AS WHEN A MAN BECOMES ILL OR SAD
OR AN AGED LADY THEY ARE AT LIBERTY HOWEVER TO WALK WITH YOUNG MARRIED LADIES OR UNMARRIED ONES WHILE THE LATTER SHOULD NEVER WALK ALONE WITH THEIR COMPANIONS
YOU MUST EXCUSE YOURSELF POLITELY FROM GIVING HIM SO MUCH TROUBLE BUT FINISH HOWEVER BY ACCEPTING ON ARRIVING AT YOUR HOUSE YOU SHOULD OFFER HIM YOUR THANKS IN ORDER TO AVOID THESE TWO INCONVENIENCES
SUCH DISORDER OF THE TOILET CAN BE EXCUSED WHEN IT OCCURS RARELY OR FOR A SHORT TIME AS IN SUCH CASES IT SEEMS EVIDENTLY OWING TO A TEMPORARY EMBARRASSMENT BUT IF IT OCCUR DAILY OR CONSTANTLY
FURTHER THE LIKENESS OF THE AGENT IS RECEIVED INTO THE PATIENT ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE PATIENT BUT THE PASSIVE INTELLECT IS AN IMMATERIAL POWER THEREFORE
FOR WE FIND AN INTELLECT WHOSE RELATION TO UNIVERSAL BEING IS THAT OF THE ACT OF ALL BEING AND SUCH IS THE DIVINE INTELLECT WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF GOD IN WHICH ORIGINALLY AND VIRTUALLY
ALL BEING PRE EXISTS AS IN ITS FIRST CAUSE AND THEREFORE THE DIVINE INTELLECT IS NOT IN POTENTIALITY BUT IS PURE ACT
THEY MUST SELECT STUFFS FOR WINTER OR SUMMER AS MAY BE SUITABLE
THE AGENT IS NOBLER THAN THE PATIENT IF THE ACTION AND THE PASSION ARE REFERRED TO THE SAME THING BUT NOT ALWAYS IF THEY REFER TO DIFFERENT THINGS
WHEREFORE EVERY CREATED INTELLECT IS NOT THE ACT OF ALL THINGS INTELLIGIBLE BY REASON OF ITS VERY EXISTENCE BUT IS COMPARED TO THESE INTELLIGIBLE THINGS AS A POTENTIALITY TO ACT
BUT IF THE INTELLECT IS PASSIVE IT IS CORRUPTIBLE
FIVE WHETHER THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS ONE IN ALL SIX WHETHER MEMORY IS IN THE INTELLECT SEVEN
OF PROPRIETY AS REGARDS ONE'S SELF ATTENTION TO ONE'S PERSON AND REPUTATION IS ALSO A DUTY IF VANITY PRIDE OR PRUDERY
WHETHER THE INTELLECT IS A POWER OF THE SOUL OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT A POWER OF THE SOUL BUT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
DIRECT OUR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS IN THIS POINT OF VIEW WE SEE THAT A REGARD TO REPUTATION IS THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE DUTIES OF PROPRIETY TOWARD ONE'S SELF
APPROPRIATE TO THE DRAWING ROOM THE NICEST CLOTH NEW AND VERY FINE LINEN AN ELEGANT BUT PLAIN WAISTCOAT A BEAUTIFUL WATCH TO WHICH IS ATTACHED A SINGLE COSTLY KEY
AND PARTLY WITH THE SENSITIVE IN ITS MODE OF OPERATION
HENCE IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE
AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEM THE IMMATERIAL NATURE OF THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WOULD NOT SUFFICE BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT WHICH MAKES THINGS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE BY WAY OF ABSTRACTION
CONSIDERATIONS OF A MORE ELEVATED NATURE AS OF GOOD DOMESTIC ORDER THE DIGNITY OF A WIFE AND THE DUTIES OF A MOTHER COME IN SUPPORT OF THIS LAW OF PROPRIETY FOR IT CONCERNS MORALITY IN ALL ITS BRANCHES
NEITHER SHOULD THEY SHOW THEMSELVES EXCEPT WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THEIR FAMILY AND THEN HE SHOULD BE A NEAR RELATION OR OF RESPECTABLE AGE EXCEPT IN CERTAIN PROVINCIAL TOWNS WHERE THERE IS A GREAT STRICTNESS IN BEHAVIOR
WHEREFORE IN GOD ALONE IS HIS INTELLECT HIS ESSENCE WHILE IN OTHER INTELLECTUAL CREATURES THE INTELLECT IS A POWER
WHETHER THE MEMORY BE DISTINCT FROM THE INTELLECT EIGHT WHETHER THE REASON IS A DISTINCT POWER FROM THE INTELLECT NINE WHETHER THE SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR REASON ARE DISTINCT POWERS
BUT SINCE ARISTOTLE DID NOT ALLOW THAT FORMS OF NATURAL THINGS EXIST APART FROM MATTER AND AS FORMS EXISTING IN MATTER ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE NATURES OR FORMS OF THE SENSIBLE THINGS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE
FURTHER AGENT AND PATIENT SUFFICE FOR ACTION IF THEREFORE THE PASSIVE INTELLECT WHICH IS A PASSIVE POWER IS SOMETHING BELONGING TO THE SOUL AND ALSO THE ACTIVE INTELLECT
GALOCHES LINED WITH FUR
IT WILL BE WELL TO REQUEST YOUR HUSBAND OR SOME ONE OF YOUR RELATIONS TO COME AND WAIT UPON YOU YOU WILL IN THIS WAY AVOID STILL ANOTHER INCONVENIENCE IN SMALL TOWNS WHERE MALICE IS EXCITED BY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF SOMETHING TO DO
FOR THE EFFECT OF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS TO GIVE LIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF UNDERSTANDING BUT THIS IS DONE BY SOMETHING HIGHER THAN THE SOUL ACCORDING TO JOHN ONE NINE
AND SHOULD BE LESS SHOWY THAN THAT OF MARRIED LADIES COSTLY CASHMERES VERY RICH FURS AND DIAMONDS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER BRILLIANT ORNAMENTS ARE TO BE FORBIDDEN A YOUNG LADY
AND IS AT FIRST LIKE A CLEAN TABLET ON WHICH NOTHING IS WRITTEN AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
NEITHER WITH AN APRON NOR CAP EVEN IF IT IS MADE OF FINE CLOTH AND TRIMMED WITH RIBBANDS NOR SHOULD A WELL BRED MAN SHOW HIMSELF IN THE STREET IN A WAISTCOAT ONLY
LIGHT IS REQUIRED FOR SIGHT NOT FOR THE COLORS TO BECOME ACTUALLY VISIBLE BUT IN ORDER THAT THE MEDIUM MAY BECOME ACTUALLY LUMINOUS AS THE COMMENTATOR SAYS ON
IN ORDER THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE NATURALLY ESTABLISHED IN THEIR PROPER GENERA AND SPECIES AND THAT OUR INTELLECT WAS FORMED BY SUCH PARTICIPATION IN ORDER TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENERA AND SPECIES OF THINGS
THE RULES SUITABLE TO AGE RESEMBLE THOSE WHICH MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE IMPOSES FOR INSTANCE OLD LADIES OUGHT TO ABSTAIN FROM GAUDY COLORS
WHEREFORE THE ANGELIC INTELLECT IS ALWAYS IN ACT AS REGARDS THOSE THINGS WHICH IT CAN UNDERSTAND BY REASON OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE FIRST INTELLECT WHICH IS PURE ACT AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE
WITH REGARD TO LADIES IT IS NECESSARY FOR THEM WHEN VISITING AT THIS TIME TO ARRANGE THEIR TOILET WITH MORE CARE CEREMONIOUS VISITS EVENING VISITS AND ESPECIALLY BALLS
TO AVOID GARMENTS TOO TIGHT OR TOO SHORT AND NOT TO HAVE IN VIEW IN THEIR TOILET ANY OTHER OBJECT BUT EASE AND NEATNESS UNLESS THE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH OR COMPLETE BALDNESS REQUIRES THEM TO WEAR A WIG EIGHT
IF IT BE A POWER WHETHER IT IS A PASSIVE POWER THREE IF IT IS A PASSIVE POWER WHETHER THERE IS AN ACTIVE INTELLECT FOUR WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL
ALL LADIES CANNOT USE INDISCRIMINATELY THE PRIVILEGE WHICH MARRIAGE CONFERS UPON THEM IN THIS RESPECT AND THE TOILET OF THOSE WHOSE FORTUNE IS MODERATE SHOULD NOT PASS THE BOUNDS OF AN ELEGANT SIMPLICITY
QUESTION SEVENTY NINE OF THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS
WENT ON MISTER ROBERTS I THINK SO THAT IS I DON'T KNOW I AM GOING TO TRY ANSWERED THE LAD THEN IF YOU SUCCEED I WISH YOU WOULD SELL US SOME FAIRLY BEGGED THE PROPRIETOR OF THE STORE
BUT YOU KNOW MISTER JENKS THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST CHEMISTS HAVE TRIED IN VAIN TO MAKE DIAMONDS OR AT BEST THEY HAVE MADE ONLY TINY ONES TO THINK THAT ANY MAN OR SET OF MEN MADE REAL DIAMONDS AS LARGE AS THE ONES YOU HAVE DOESN'T SEEM WELL AND TOM HESITATED
THEN STEPPING CLOSE TO TOM HE WHISPERED MISTER JENKS TOLD ME MISTER JENKS TOM COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT YES MISTER BARCOE JENKS BUT I DID NOT COME HERE TO MERELY ASK YOU FOR EMPLOYMENT
TOM SWIFT CONSIDERED A FEW MINUTES ON THE FACE OF IT THE PROPOSITION APPEALED TO HIM HE HAD BEEN HOME SOME TIME NOW AFTER HIS ADVENTURES ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO LONG FOR MORE EXCITEMENT
RISING ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AND CIRCLING ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES TO TEST THE WIND CURRENTS TOM HEADED HIS CRAFT TOWARD CHESTER A CITY ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM SHOPTON IN HIS POCKET SNUGLY TUCKED AWAY WERE THE TWO STONES MISTER JENKS HAD GIVEN HIM
A GEM EXPERT SAID THE CLERK PLEASE BE SEATED THE YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARED INTO A PRIVATE OFFICE WITH THE STONES AND TOM WAITED HE WONDERED IF HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS TROUBLE FOR HIS PAINS
I'LL MEET YOU HERE TO MORROW NIGHT IN THE MEANWHILE FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION I'LL LET AN EXPERT LOOK AT THESE STONES GET THE GREATEST DIAMOND EXPERT IN THE WORLD AND HE'LL PRONOUNCE THEM PERFECT PREDICTED THE ODD MAN NOW I'LL BID YOU GOODNIGHT AND BE GOING
CHAPTER THREE A STRANGE STORY WELL MISTER JENKS BEGAN TOM WHEN HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN AND GREETED THE MAN WHO HAD ACTED SO STRANGELY ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND THIS IS RATHER AN ODD TIME FOR A VISIT
BUT AFTER I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN CHEATED OUT OF MY RIGHTS AND WHEN I BEGAN TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING THEIR SECRET WHEREABOUTS I RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS AND ANONYMOUS WARNINGS TO STOP BUT I DID NOT
NOW I'VE GOT YOU HE SHOUTED I'LL TEACH YOU TO SLASH MY AEROPLANE COME WITH ME ANDY GAVE ONE LOOK AT THE WHITE BIRD LIKE APPARATUS THAT HAD FLOWN UP BESIDE HIM SO NOISELESSLY AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RECOGNIZE TOM'S VOICE
BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS THEY HAD COME TO THE END OF THEIR ROPE THOUGH SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOLWELL SAID THAT HE AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD TEMPORARILY SEPARATED
I GOT YOUR ADDRESS FROM THE OWNER OF THE YACHT RESOLUTE I KNEW THAT IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO COULD AID ME TO RECOVER MY RIGHTS IT WOULD BE YOU TOM SWIFT WILL YOU HELP ME WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN
I SHOULD SAY IT WAS WORTH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS IT IS NOW THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THESE TWO STONES EXCLAIMED TOM THEY ARE WORTH EVERY CENT OF IT DECLARED MISTER ROBERTS
I HOPE NO ONE WAS MADE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN MY IMPRUDENCE NO THE LAD WHOM MISTER TRACK CAUGHT WAS LET GO BUT HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO COME TO SHOPTON TO SEE YOU
THINKING OF MANY THINGS AND WONDERING HOW BEST TO START IN HIS AIRSHIP RED CLOUD FOR THE MYSTERIOUS PHANTOM MOUNTAIN TOM HURRIED BACK TO WHERE HE HAD LEFT THE MONOPLANE WHEELED IT OUT AND WAS SOON SOARING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARD SHOPTON
I KNEW NOTHING MORE UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF BACK IN THE SMALL HOTEL AT INDIAN RIDGE WHENCE I HAD GONE SOME TIME PREVIOUS WITH THE MEN TO THE CAVE IN THE MOUNTAIN WHAT HAPPENED ASKED TOM MUCH SURPRISED BY THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOME OF THE AFFAIR
THEY ARE SO FAR SUPERIOR TO THE USUAL RUN OF DIAMONDS THAT I FEEL JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT THE CUT ONE WOULD BRING FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ANYWHERE IN FACT I WOULD OFFER THAT FOR IT THE OTHER IS LARGER THOUGH WHAT IT WOULD LOSE IN CUTTING WOULD BE HARD TO SAY
TOM MISTER ROBERTS LOOKED AT HIS GEM EXPERT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY
WHEN MISTER JENKS COMES TO NIGHT I'LL TELL HIM I'LL HELP HIM TO GET HIS RIGHTS AND DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS AS TOM WAS WHEELING THE BUTTERFLY INTO THE SHED ERADICATE CAME OUT TO HELP HIM DERE'S A GEN'MAN HERE TO SEE YO MASSA TOM
I INTENDED IT FOR YOU ANYHOW FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ME ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND TAKE IT AND AND GIVE IT TO THE PERSON FOR WHOM YOU WERE ABOUT TO PURCHASE A DIAMOND TO NIGHT
THAT WAS MY UNDOING HOW AS SOON AS THE MEN GOT THE CASH THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THE NEXT I REMEMBER IS EATING A RUDE MEAL WHILE WE DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF MAKING DIAMONDS
I WAS TAKEN INTO A SMALL CHAMBER OF THE CAVE AND THERE SAW QUITE A COMPLICATED APPARATUS PART OF IT WAS A GREAT STEEL BOX WITH A LEVER ON IT WE WILL LET YOU MAKE SOME DIAMONDS FOR YOURSELF FOLWELL SAID TO ME
I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR THIS WILL YOU DELIGHTED AS THE BOYS SAY HOP IN MY AIRSHIP AND I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT INTO TOWN
AND HE GAVE THEM TO ME TO HAVE TESTED IN ANY WAY I DESIRED I PROMISED TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND AS I WAS QUITE WEALTHY AS IN FACT I AM NOW AND IF I FOUND THAT THE STONES HE GAVE ME WERE REAL I SAID I MIGHT INVEST SOME MONEY IN THE PLANT WERE THE DIAMONDS GOOD
CHAPTER FIVE A MYSTERIOUS MAN
ASKED THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN IS THAT NECESSARY INQUIRED THE LAD I CAME BY THEM IN A LEGITIMATE MANNER IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I CAN SATISFY YOU ON THAT POINT
ASKED TOM EAGERLY THE FINEST I HAVE EVER TESTED DECLARED THE OTHER MAN EVIDENTLY MISTER PORTER THE GEM EXPERT THEY ARE A JOY TO LOOK AT MISTER ROBERTS HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE PROPRIETOR
WHICH I HAD PROMISED WHEN THEY SHOWED ME CONCLUSIVELY THAT THEY COULD MAKE DIAMONDS I REFUSED TO DO THIS UNTIL I HAD SEEN SOME OF THE PRECIOUS STONES AND THEY AGREED THAT THIS WAS FAIR BUT SAID I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DAYS WELL I WAITED
YOU MEAN YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ME ASKED MISTER JENKS I GUESS THAT'S IT ASSENTED TOM I DON'T BLAME YOU A BIT EXCLAIMED THE ODD MAN IN FACT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD MAKE DIAMONDS
TOM SENT HIS CRAFT DOWN IN ORDER TO PICK OUT A SAFE PLACE FOR A LANDING HE WAS THEN OVER THE SUBURBS OF THE CITY AND WAS FOLLOWING THE LINE OF A STRAIGHT COUNTRY ROAD LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE THERE HE MURMURED I'LL SHUT OFF THE MOTOR AND VOL PLANE DOWN
ANDY PEDALED ON NEVER LOOKING UP NOR BEHIND HIM A MOMENT LATER AS TOM THREW UP HIS HEADPLANES TO MAKE HIS LANDING MORE EASY AND JUST AS HE SWOOPED DOWN AT ONE SIDE OF THE CYCLIST OUR HERO LET OUT A MOST ALARMING YELL RIGHT INTO ANDY'S EAR
NO I DON'T REPLIED TOM SHARPLY FOR HE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE MAN I WAS TOLD THAT YOU DID WAS THE RATHER SURPRISING ANSWER WHO TOLD YOU THE MAN LOOKED ALL AROUND THE SHED BEFORE REPLYING AS IF FEARFUL OF BEING OVERHEARD
HOW MUCH IS YOUR CHARGE NOTHING WAS THE UNEXPECTED ANSWER WE ARE VERY GLAD TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING SUCH STONES IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING ANY MORE PERHAPS
THE SEARCH FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAIN AND THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS MIGHT OFFER A NEW FIELD FOR HIM BUT THERE CAME TO HIM A CERTAIN DISTRUST OF MISTER JENKS I DON'T LIKE TO DOUBT YOUR WORD BEGAN TOM SLOWLY
HE LOOKED ABOUT AND SAW THAT HE WAS NEAR A HOUSE IN THE REAR OF WHICH WAS A GOOD SIZED BARN GUESS I'LL ASK IF I CAN LEAVE THE BUTTERFLY THERE HE MURMURED AND RINGING THE DOORBELL HE WAS GREETED BY A MAN
TOM SWIFT MADE UP HIS MIND QUICKLY AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT IF THE DIAMONDS WERE REAL IF THEY WERE HE COULD THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO GO WITH MISTER JENKS ON THE MYSTERIOUS QUEST SO HE ANSWERED I'LL CONSIDER THE MATTER MISTER JENKS
THEY SAID THEY WERE READY TO PROCEED WITH THE MAKING OF DIAMONDS BUT I MUST PROMISE NOT TO SEEK TO DISCOVER THE SECRET UNTIL THEY GAVE ME PERMISSION NOR WAS I TO ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE CAVE I HAD TO AGREE NEXT THEY DEMANDED THAT I GIVE THEM A LARGE SUM
AND HE DIRECTED ME TO PULL THE LEVER OF THE BOX AT A CERTAIN SIGNAL THE SIGNAL CAME JUST AS A TERRIFIC CRASH OF THUNDER SHOOK THE VERY MOUNTAIN INSIDE OF WHICH WE WERE THE BOX OF STEEL GOT RED HOT AND WHEN IT COOLED OFF IT WAS OPENED
OF COURSE I DID NOT TELL HIM TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I SAW FOLWELL AGAIN TOLD HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND TO TELL THEM THAT I WOULD AGREE TO SUPPLY THE CASH NEEDED IF I COULD SHARE IN THE DIAMOND MAKING TO THIS THEY AGREED
HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR WITH A KEY HE CARRIED TURNED ON THE LIGHTS WHICH WERE RUN BY A STORAGE BATTERY AND MOTIONED MISTER JENKS TO A SEAT NOW I'LL HEAR YOUR STORY SAID TOM I'LL MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE WENT ON THE QUEER MAN
OH IT ISN'T THAT THE PROPRIETOR HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM BUT THESE ARE DIAMONDS OF SUCH A PECULIAR KIND SO PERFECT AND WITHOUT A FLAW THAT I WONDERED FROM WHAT PART OF THE WORLD THEY CAME THEN THEY ARE DIAMONDS
I THINK I'LL GO WITH MISTER JENKS HE DECIDED AS HE PREPARED FOR A LANDING IN THE OPEN SPACE NEAR HIS AEROPLANE SHED IT WILL BE A RISKY TRIP PERHAPS BUT I'VE TAKEN RISKS BEFORE
HOWEVER I DECIDED TO COME HERE AND I DID IT SEEMED ALMOST PROVIDENTIAL THAT MY FIRST VIEW OF YOU WAS IN A JEWELRY SHOP LOOKING AT DIAMONDS I TOOK IT AS A GOOD OMEN NOW IT REMAINS WITH YOU MAY I CALL HERE TO MORROW NIGHT AND GET YOUR ANSWER
THE LATTER MOTIONED TO TOM WILL YOU KINDLY STEP INSIDE HERE REQUESTED THE ELDERLY MAN WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
PRESENTLY TWO ELDERLY GENTLEMEN CAME FROM THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE GLASS DOOR OF WHICH APPEARED THE WORD DIAMONDS WHO BROUGHT THESE STONES IN ASKED ONE OF THE MEN EVIDENTLY THE PROPRIETOR FROM THE DEFERENCE PAID HIM BY THE CLERK
AS YOU DOUBTLESS SAW WHEN WE WERE ON THE ISLAND BUT I KNEW I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP IN WHICH TO FLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND PICK OUT THE LOCATION OF THE CAVE WHERE THE DIAMONDS ARE MADE BUT HOW CAN YOU LOCATE IT IF YOU WERE BLINDFOLDED WHEN YOU WERE TAKEN THERE MISTER JENKS
AND I WAS TRICKED I DETERMINED TO BE REVENGED OR AT LEAST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF MAKING DIAMONDS IT IS MY RIGHT I AGREE WITH YOU SPOKE TOM
I TALKED WITH THE MAN AND HE MADE A CURIOUS STATEMENT THIS MAN WHO GAVE HIS NAME AS ENOS FOLWELL SAID HE KNEW A PLACE WHERE DIAMONDS COULD BE MADE PARTLY IN A SCIENTIFIC MANNER AND PARTLY BY THE FORCES OF NATURE
THE OTHER IN A ROUGH STATE DO YOU CARE TO STATE WHERE THESE DIAMONDS CAME FROM ASKED MISTER ROBERTS LOOKING CRITICALLY AT TOM I HAD RATHER NOT ANSWERED THE LAD IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE DIAMONDS
HE REMAINED PROSTRATE IN THE DUST AND TOM OBSERVING HIM THOUGHT PERHAPS THE BULLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED BUT A LITTLE LATER ANDY CAUTIOUSLY RAISED HIS HEAD AND INQUIRED IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE IS IT IS IT GONE
HE KNEW THAT TOM WOULD HAVE A CLEAR CASE AGAINST HIM AND HE DID NOT DARE ANSWER INSTEAD HE SHUFFLED OVER TO WHERE HIS WHEEL LAY PICKED IT UP AND RODE SLOWLY OFF GOOD RIDDANCE MURMURED TOM
STANDING OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE MOONLIGHT WHEN I SAW IT THAT HEAD OF ROCK IS NEAR THE CAVE IT MAY BE THE LANDMARK BY WHICH WE CAN LOCATE PHANTOM MOUNTAIN PERHAPS ADMITTED THE YOUNG INVENTOR WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THIS
IN THE RAYS OF THE MOON IT SHOWED ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW A BEAUTIFUL GEM THAT IS ONE OF THE STONES I MADE OR RATHER THAT I SUPPOSED I HAD MADE WENT ON MISTER JENKS IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL I HAVE
NO SAH IT AIN'T MASSA DAMON DE GEN'MAN'S IN DE AIRSHIP SHED WAITIN FO YOU IN THE AIRSHIP SHED NO STRANGERS ARE ALLOWED IN THERE RAD
QUERIED THE PROPRIETOR OF THE PLACE TOM NOTICED AT ONCE THAT THE WORD DIAMONDS WAS NOT USED I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY WERE OF ANY VALUE HE SAID ARE THEY DIAMONDS WOULD YOU MIND STATING WHERE YOU GOT THEM
AND THE YOUNG INVENTOR WISHED TO GET THE OPINION OF SOME OTHER JEWELER THAN MISTER TRACK AT LEAST AT FIRST THOUGH IF THIS ONE PROVES TO BE A GOOD GEM I'LL HAVE MISTER TRACK SET IT IN A BROOCH AND GIVE IT TO MARY FOR HER BIRTHDAY DECIDED THE YOUNG INVENTOR
I HAD GIVEN THE MEN A VERY LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND IN EXCHANGE THEY HAD GIVEN ME SEVERAL DIAMONDS PROBABLY THE STONES ARE WORTH NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE MONEY I INVESTED BUT I WAS CHEATED FOR I WAS PROMISED AN EQUAL SHARE IN THE PROFITS THESE WERE DENIED ME
OH I DON'T MIND BEING AWAKENED ANSWERED TOM GOOD NATUREDLY BUT I WILL BE FRANK WITH YOU MISTER JENKS I HARDLY CAN BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE STATED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES THAT YOU KNOW HOW DIAMONDS CAN BE MADE I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU
HE CALLED AT MY APARTMENTS ABOUT A WEEK LATER SAYING HE HAD SECURED WORK AS AN EXPERT SETTER OF DIAMONDS AND WANTED TO REPAY ME I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE HIS MONEY BUT THE FACT THAT SUCH A SORRY LOOKING SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN I AIDED HIM WAS AN EXPERT HANDLER OF GEMS INTERESTED ME
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT ON OUR JOURNEY INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND JUST BEFORE I WAS CARRIED INTO THE CAVE I MANAGED TO RAISE ONE CORNER OF THE BANDAGE I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A VERY PECULIARLY SHAPED CLIFF IT IS LIKE A GREAT HEAD
ANSWERED TOM AS HE ACCEPTED THE GEMS WHICH THE EXPERT HELD OUT TO HIM THEN MIGHT WE SPEAK FOR A SUPPLY WENT ON MISTER ROBERTS EAGERLY WE WILL PAY YOU THE FULL MARKET PRICE WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THESE STONES ASKED
I'M INTERESTED IN AIRSHIPS AND I'LL CONSIDER IT A FAVOR IF YOU'LL LET ME LOOK YOURS OVER WHILE IT'S HERE TOM READILY AGREED AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HAD CAUGHT A TROLLEY GOING INTO THE CITY HE WAS SOON IN ONE OF THE LARGEST JEWELRY STORES OF CHESTER
BECAUSE THERE ARE ENEMIES ON MY TRACK IF THEY THOUGHT I WAS SEEKING AID TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN MY LIFE MIGHT PAY THE FORFEIT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MISTER JENKS I CERTAINLY AM
THAT IF YOU DO HEAR IT YOU WILL BE SO FASCINATED BY IT THAT I AM SURE YOU WILL WANT TO CAST YOUR LOT IN WITH MINE AND AID ME TO GET MY RIGHTS AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND I ALSO WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IF YOU DO THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER CONNECTED WITH IT
I HAD A DREAM DAT SOME COON WERE TRYIN T STEAL HIM AN IT SORT OB STURBED ME LAIK IF IT WASN'T YOUR MAN IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE SAID MISTER JENKS DECIDEDLY WE'LL HAVE A LOOK EXCLAIMED TOM
AFTER TRAVELING FOR SOME DISTANCE I WAS LED STILL BLINDFOLDED UP A STEEP TRAIL WHEN THE BANDAGE WAS TAKEN OFF MY EYES I SAW THAT I WAS IN A LARGE CAVE THE MEN WERE WITH ME AND THEY APOLOGIZED FOR THE NECESSITY THAT CAUSED THEM TO BLINDFOLD ME
TAKE THEM TO ANY JEWELER HE RESUMED TO THE ONE IN WHOSE PLACE I SAW YOU TO NIGHT I'LL ABIDE BY THE VERDICT YOU GET AND I'LL COME HERE TO MORROW NIGHT AND HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY WHY DO YOU COME AT NIGHT
I CAME EAST AND TRIED TO GET HELP TO DISCOVER THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS BUT I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP AS I SAID AND NO PERSON WHO COULD OPERATE ONE WOULD AGREE TO GO WITH ME ON THE QUEST AGAIN
I WONDERED WHERE HE HAD BEEN KEEPING HIMSELF SINCE HE DAMAGED THE BUTTERFLY EVIDENTLY HE DOESN'T DARE VENTURE BACK TO SHOPTON WELL HERE'S WHERE I GIVE HIM A SCARE TOM'S MONOPLANE WAS MAKING NO MORE NOISE NOW THAN A SOARING BIRD
I'M USED TO DANGER ANSWERED TOM QUIETLY LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY BUT FIRST EXPLAIN HOW YOU CAME TO COME HERE AND WHY YOU ACTED SO STRANGELY AT THE JEWELRY STORE WILLINGLY
HERE RAD COME OVER AND SCURRY AMONG THOSE TREES WE JUST SAW SOME ONE SNEAKING AROUND I'LL SURE DO DAT CRIED THE COLORED MAN MEBBY IT WERE SOMEBODY ARTER BOOMERANG I'LL FIND EM I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS ANY ONE AFTER THE MULE MURMURED MISTER JENKS
BUT FIRST LET ME SUGGEST THAT WE MOVE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE HOUSE MY FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON OR THE HOUSEKEEPER MAY HEAR US TALKING AND IT MAY DISTURB THEM COME WITH ME TO MY PRIVATE SHOP AND TOM LED THE WAY TO A SMALL BUILDING WHERE HE DID EXPERIMENTAL WORK
I DID BUT WITHOUT AVAIL I SPENT SOME TIME IN THE ROCKIES BUT NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WAS IN FACT FEW HAD HEARD OF IT AND I WAS NEARLY LOST SEARCHING FOR IT I CAME BACK EAST DETERMINED TO GET EVEN
BUT UP TO THE TIME I MET YOU ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND I COULD FORM NO PLAN FOR DISCOVERING PHANTOM MOUNTAIN AND LEARNING THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS WENT ON MISTER JENKS
FOR THE REASON THAT THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE ON MY TRAIL AS LONG AS I REMAINED QUIET AFTER THEIR SHABBY TREATMENT OF ME AND DID NOT TRY TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
HE WAS GLIDING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE EARTH AND WITH THE PLAN IN HIS MIND OF ADMINISTERING SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT TO THE BULLY HE AIMED THE MACHINE DIRECTLY AT HIM NEARER AND NEARER SHOT THE MONOPLANE AS QUIETLY AS A SHEET OF PAPER MIGHT FALL
BUT THEY PROVED IT TO ME I'M READY NOW TO PROVE IT TO YOU I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO HERE'S THIS ONE STONE CUT READY FOR SETTING HERE'S ANOTHER UNCUT AND MISTER JENKS DREW FROM HIS POCKET WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PIECE OF CRYSTAL
WILL YOU GO TOM SWIFT THE YOUNG INVENTOR DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER HOW FAR WAS MISTER JENKS TO BE TRUSTED WERE THE STONES HE HAD REAL DIAMONDS WAS HIS STORY FANTASTICAL AS IT SOUNDED TRUE
THE YOUNG INVENTOR ADDED AS HE SAW THE CLERK LOOKING RATHER DOUBTFULLY AT HIM FOR TOM HAD ON A ROUGH SUIT WHICH HE ALWAYS DONNED WHEN HE FLEW IN HIS MONOPLANE
I DID NOT WANT TO AGREE TO THIS BUT THEY INSISTED AND I GAVE IN FOOLISHLY PERHAPS AT ANY RATE I WAS BLINDFOLDED ONE NIGHT PLACED IN A WAGON AND WE DROVE OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS
I'LL BE HERE TO MORROW NIGHT TOM AND I HOPE YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVORABLE TOM DID NOT SLEEP WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT FOR HIS FITFUL SLUMBERS WERE DISTURBED BY DREAMS OF ENORMOUS CAVES FILLED WITH DIAMONDS WITH DARK SHADOWY FIGURES TRYING TO PUT HIM INTO A RED HOT STEEL BOX
BUT THE EXACT LOCATION IS A MYSTERY THAT IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND THE REASON WELL AS I SAID MYSELF FOLWELL AND THE OTHERS WHO WERE NOT EXACTLY PREPOSSESSING SORT OF MEN STARTED WEST
HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND IN SOME TIME NO MASSA TOM IT AIN'T HIM I KNOWS DAT BLESSIN MAN GOOD AN PROPER
THEY HAD ALL AGREED TO GO OUT INTO CIVILIZATION AND WORK FOR ENOUGH FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO GO ON WITH THEIR DIAMOND MAKING I HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO BELIEVE THE MAN OR NOT BUT HE OFFERED PROOF HE HAD SEVERAL SMALL BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS WITH HIM
I RECEIVED A WARNING TO DROP ALL SEARCH FOR THE DIAMOND MAKERS BUT I PERSISTED AND ABOUT A WEEK AGO I FOUND I WAS BEING SHADOWED SHADOWED BY WHOM ASKED TOM BY A MAN I NEVER REMEMBER SEEING BUT WHO I HAVE NO DOUBT
I'LL PAY YOU IF YOU'LL LET ME STORE MY MACHINE IN THE BARN A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL I GO INTO THE CITY AND RETURN SPOKE THE LAD INDEED YOU'RE WELCOME TO LEAVE IT THERE WITHOUT PAY WAS THE ANSWER
I'LL BE HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW AS MISTER JENKS TURNED ASIDE THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD AND A SHADOWY FIGURE WAS SEEN HURRYING AWAY WHO'S THAT ASKED THE DIAMOND MAN IN A HOARSE WHISPER
GUESS I'LL TAKE A RUN OVER TO CHESTER IN THE BUTTERFLY AND SEE WHAT ONE OF THE JEWELERS THERE HAS TO SAY IN ADDITION TO HIS BIG AIRSHIP RED CLOUD TOM OWNED A SMALL SWIFT MONOPLANE WHICH HE CALLED BUTTERFLY
WHEN WE GOT TO A SMALL TOWN CALLED INDIAN RIDGE NEAR LEADVILLE COLORADO THE MEN INSISTED THAT I MUST NOW PROCEED IN SECRET AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AS THEY WERE NOT YET READY TO REVEAL THE SECRET OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY MADE THE DIAMONDS
WENT ON MISTER JENKS WILL YOU GO WITH ME ON THIS QUEST GO IN YOUR AIRSHIP TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS IF YOU WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHATEVER DIAMONDS WE CAN DISCOVER OR MAKE BESIDES PAYING ALL EXPENSES
I WAS TOUCHED BY THE MAN'S APPEARANCE AND GAVE HIM SOME MONEY HE ASKED FOR MY CARD SAYING HE WOULD REPAY ME SOME DAY I GAVE IT TO HIM LITTLE THINKING I WOULD HEAR FROM THE MAN AGAIN BUT I DID
AN HE WOULDN'T COME OUT WHEN I TOLD HIM AN YOUR PA AN MISTER JACKSON AIN'T HOME I'LL SEE ABOUT THIS EXCLAIMED TOM STRIDING TO THE LARGE SHED WHERE THE RED CLOUD WAS KEPT AS HE ENTERED IT HE SAW A MAN LOOKING OVER THE WONDERFUL CRAFT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME
WAS THE REPLY AND THE COLORED MAN CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE STABLE
MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY SOME SUPERNATURAL VISITOR ANDY GAVE A YELL LIKE AN INDIAN ABOUT TO DO A STAGE SCALPING ACT AND FAIRLY DIVED OVER THE HANDLEBARS OF HIS BICYCLE SPRAWLING IN A HEAP ON THE DUSTY ROAD
I HAD BEEN TRICKED THAT WAS ALL AS SOON AS THE MEN HAD MY MONEY THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THEY DID NOT WANT ME TO LEARN THE SECRET OF THEIR DIAMOND MAKING AND THEY DRUGGED ME CARRIED ME AWAY FROM THE CAVE AND LEFT ME IN THE HOTEL DIDN'T YOU TRY TO FIND THE CAVE AGAIN
STAMMERED ANDY GETTING TO HIS FEET HE WASN'T HURT MUCH TOM THOUGHT HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY RESUMED OUR HERO DID YOU THINK IT WAS A HOB GOBLIN IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE AFTER YOU ANDY HUH NEVER MIND WHAT I THOUGHT
ASKED TOM WHO WAS BEGINNING TO BE INTERESTED THEY WERE STONES OF THE FIRST WATER THOUGH SMALL AN EXPERT GEM MERCHANT TO WHOM I TOOK THEM SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY DIAMONDS LIKE THEM AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I GOT THEM
IF WE GO IT WILL HAVE TO BE IN AN AIRSHIP FOR IN NO OTHER WAY I THINK CAN WE COME UPON THE PLACE AS IT IS CLOSELY GUARDED WILL YOU COME I WILL PAY YOU WELL PERHAPS I HAD BETTER HEAR YOUR STORY SAID THE YOUNG INVENTOR
I TRIED TO ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION AT THE STORE BECAUSE I SAW THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BUY A DIAMOND AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WHY NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO PRESENT YOU WITH A BEAUTIFUL STONE THAT WILL ANSWER YOUR PURPOSE AS WELL OR BETTER THAN
AS HE GOT NEARER TO THE GROUND HE SAW THE FIGURE OF A LAD RIDING A BICYCLE ALONG THE COUNTRY HIGHWAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIGURE STRUCK TOM AS BEING FAMILIAR AND HE RECOGNIZED THE CYCLIST A MOMENT LATER IT'S ANDY FOGER SAID TOM IN A WHISPER
WAS THE REPLY OR RATHER WE DIDN'T IT WAS THE NERVOUS REACTION CAUSED BY YOUR FRIGHT AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAD DONE WRONG THAT MADE YOU JUMP OVER THE HANDLEBARS THAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION YOU YOU DID IT
IS WHAT GONE ASKED TOM GRIMLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE ANDY LOOKED UP WAS THAT YOU TOM SWIFT HE DEMANDED DID YOU KNOCK ME OFF MY WHEEL MY MONOPLANE AND I TOGETHER DID
I'LL JUST DROP DOWN OUTSIDE OF THE CITY HE REASONED FOR TOO MUCH OF A CROWD GATHERS WHEN I LAND IN THE STREET BESIDES I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HORSES AND THEN TOO IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD START FROM THE STREET I'LL LEAVE IT IN SOME BARN UNTIL I WANT TO GO BACK
DO YOU WANT TO SELL TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD HE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE GOOD NEWS MISTER JENKS HAD TOLD THE TRUTH NOW THE YOUNG INVENTOR COULD GO WITH HIM TO SEEK THE DIAMOND MAKERS CAN YOU GET ANY MORE OF THESE
FOR BREAKING THE PROPELLER OF THE BUTTERFLY AND SLASHING HER WINGS I'VE MENDED HER UP HOWEVER SO SHE GOES BETTER THAN EVER AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE POLICE STATION IN JIG TIME WANT TO COME ANDY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE BULLY
I LAUGHED AT HIM BUT HE TOLD ME SO MANY DETAILS THAT I BEGAN TO BELIEVE HIM HE SAID HE AND SOME OTHER FRIENDS OF HIS WHO WERE DIAMOND CUTTERS HAD A PLANT IN THE MIDST OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHERE THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING SEVERAL SMALL
AND WAS GIVEN A HANDFUL OF WHITE STONES WERE THEY DIAMONDS ASKED TOM EAGERLY MISTER JENKS HELD OUT ONE HAND IN THE PALM GLITTERED A LARGE STONE OSTENSIBLY A DIAMOND
BUT THE MONOPLANE HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND ANDY HAD LEFT TOWN NOT HAVING RETURNED SINCE TELLING HIS FATHER THAT HE WAS GOING OFF ON A LITTLE BUSINESS TRIP WHICH HE OFTEN DID IN HIS AEROPLANE TOM WITH THE AID OF MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER WHEELED THE BUTTERFLY OUT OF ITS SHED
DID YOU SEE THAT TOM SWIFT SOME ONE WAS HERE LISTENING TO WHAT I SAID PERHAPS IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN SHADOWING ME I THINK NOT I GUESS IT WAS ERADICATE SAMPSON A COLORED MAN WHO DOES WORK FOR US SAID TOM IS THAT YOU RAD HE CALLED
