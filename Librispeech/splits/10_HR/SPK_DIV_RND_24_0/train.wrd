IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
NEVERTHELESS SIR YOU SEE I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR FIRST APPEAL ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THE CONVERSATION MUST BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR ME THAN FOR YOU
NO SAID VILLEFORT BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS NO A HUNDRED TIMES NO THEN YOU DID NOT BURY THE POOR CHILD THERE SIR WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME WHERE DID YOU PLACE IT TELL ME WHERE THERE
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
THAT HER WHITE COMPLEXION AND BRILLIANT EYES WERE ALONE VISIBLE THE CAB CROSSED THE PONT NEUF AND ENTERED THE RUE DE HARLAY BY THE PLACE DAUPHINE THE DRIVER WAS PAID AS THE DOOR OPENED
THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
COME BEFORE HIM DISGUISED UNDER THE SPECIOUS FORM OF NECESSITY THEN AFTER ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT OF DELIRIUM OR OF FEAR WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AND ESCAPED IT
IF MY HEART BE PETRIFIED IT IS THAT IT MIGHT SUSTAIN THE BLOWS IT HAS RECEIVED I WAS NOT SO IN MY YOUTH I WAS NOT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETROTHAL
BUT YOU SAID REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS HE WOULD REQUIRE IT AS A PROOF AH NO MADAME THAT COULD NOT BE DEAD BODIES ARE NOT KEPT A YEAR THEY ARE SHOWN TO A MAGISTRATE AND THE EVIDENCE IS TAKEN NOW NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS HAPPENED
IT IS TRUE THEN HE SAID RATHER UTTERING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD THAN ADDRESSING HIS COMPANION IT IS TRUE THEN
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MAN'S FOOTSTEPS CEASED THAN HE STARTED UP DREW THE BOLTS CLOSED THE CURTAINS AND EXAMINED EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM THEN WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY RELIEVED OF DOUBTS HE SAID
THE HOUR THEN FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN WAITING DURING THE LAST YEAR HAD AT LENGTH ARRIVED HOW I WORKED HOW I HOPED HOW I STRUCK EVERY PIECE OF TURF THINKING TO FIND SOME RESISTANCE TO MY SPADE BUT NO I FOUND NOTHING
WHEN YOU WERE HALF EXPIRING ON THAT BED IN THE RED DAMASK ROOM WHILE I SCARCELY LESS AGITATED THAN YOU AWAITED YOUR DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS BORN WAS GIVEN TO ME MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS VOICELESS WE THOUGHT IT DEAD
SO THE WOMAN LAID HER HANDS ON THE DEAD CHILD AND SWORE AND IT WAS RESTORED TO LIFE THEN THE HEADMAN WAS DUMBFOUNDED AND RELUCTANTLY BROUGHT OUT FIVE GOLD PIECES AND GAVE THEM TO THE WOMAN
DOUBTLESS HE IS CAPRICIOUS BUT THAT IS ALL ONE THING ALONE STRUCK ME OF ALL THE EXQUISITE THINGS HE PLACED BEFORE US HE TOUCHED NOTHING I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HE WAS POISONING US AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
NOTHING WAS FOUND BENEATH THE FLOWERS THERE WAS NO CHILD DISINTERRED NO YOU MUST NOT WEEP NO YOU MUST NOT GROAN YOU MUST TREMBLE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ASKED MADAME DANGLARS SHUDDERING
OH IT REQUIRES ALL MY REASON TO CONVINCE ME THAT I AM NOT A VERY GUILTY WOMAN AND YOU A MENACING JUDGE
OH THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN IS VERY GREAT SAID VILLEFORT SINCE IT SURPASSES THE GOODNESS OF GOD DID YOU OBSERVE THAT MAN'S EYES WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO US NO BUT HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED HIM CAREFULLY
I HAVE SO MUCH WEALTH THAT I CANNOT LOOK AFTER IT ALL ASK HIM TO TAKE AWAY HALF FROM ME THE YOUTH PROMISED AND WENT ON AND HE MET ANOTHER MAN WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SO MANY CATTLE THAT HE COULD NOT BUILD ENOUGH COW HOUSES FOR THEM
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU MAD I HOPED FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT SAID VILLEFORT BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS DENIED ME HOWEVER RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND MY IDEAS WHY SAID I SHOULD THAT MAN HAVE CARRIED AWAY THE CORPSE
HAD DUG ANOTHER HOLE AND DEPOSITED IT THERE BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING THEN THE IDEA STRUCK ME THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN THESE PRECAUTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY THROWN IT IN A CORNER IN THE LAST CASE I MUST WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT TO RENEW MY SEARCH I REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WAITED
I STOOD IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AND THREW MYSELF DOWN I ROSE AND AGAIN BEGAN DIGGING AND ENLARGING THE HOLE STILL I FOUND NOTHING NOTHING THE CHEST WAS NO LONGER THERE THE CHEST NO LONGER THERE MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS CHOKING WITH FEAR
HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
OH HEAVENS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED I WENT DOWN AGAIN MY FIRST VISIT WAS TO THE THICKET I HOPED TO FIND SOME TRACES WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME IN THE DARKNESS
WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
MADAME DANGLARS HAD RISEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PROCUREUR WHOSE HANDS SHE WRUNG IN HER FEEBLE GRASP I KNOW NOT I MERELY SUPPOSE SO AS I MIGHT SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED VILLEFORT WITH A LOOK SO FIXED
THINK NOT I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE EFFORT CONTINUED VILLEFORT NO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE THICKET I THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN HAVING DISCOVERED THE CHEST AND SUPPOSING IT TO BE A TREASURE HAD INTENDED CARRYING IT OFF BUT PERCEIVING HIS ERROR
BEHIND ME WAS AN ARTIFICIAL ROCKERY INTENDED TO SERVE AS A RESTING PLACE FOR PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN FALLING MY HAND RELAXING ITS HOLD OF THE LABURNUM FELT THE COLDNESS OF THE STONE ON MY RIGHT I SAW THE TREE BEHIND ME THE ROCK
YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IF IT WERE SO SAID HE RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE BARONESS TO SPEAK TO HER IN A LOWER TONE WE ARE LOST THIS CHILD LIVES AND SOME ONE KNOWS IT LIVES SOME ONE IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET
IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY STEP IN OUR LIVES IS LIKE THE COURSE OF AN INSECT ON THE SANDS IT LEAVES ITS TRACK ALAS TO MANY THE PATH IS TRACED BY TEARS SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS
A MAN MAY MURDER ANOTHER OUT OF REVENGE BUT HE WOULD NOT DELIBERATELY DROWN A CHILD PERHAPS CONTINUED VILLEFORT HE HAD PUT IT IN THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OH YES YES CRIED THE BARONESS MY CHILD IS THERE
THAT I SHOULD CAUSE ALL TRACES OF THE PAST TO DISAPPEAR THAT I SHOULD DESTROY EVERY MATERIAL VESTIGE TOO MUCH REALITY WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IN MY RECOLLECTION IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD ANNULLED THE LEASE IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD COME IT WAS FOR THIS I WAS WAITING
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE LITTLE GATE BUT THIS EXAMINATION WAS AS USELESS AS THE FIRST AND WITH A BURSTING HEART I RETURNED TO THE THICKET WHICH NOW CONTAINED NO HOPE FOR ME OH CRIED MADAME DANGLARS
AND THEN FLUNG IT DOWN IN HASTE SCARCELY HAD I COVERED IT WITH EARTH WHEN THE ARM OF THE CORSICAN WAS STRETCHED TOWARDS ME I SAW A SHADOW RISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A FLASH OF LIGHT I FELT PAIN
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID I FEIGNED A CRIMINAL PROCESS AND EMPLOYED ALL THE MOST ACUTE BLOODHOUNDS AND SKILFUL AGENTS IN SEARCH OF HER
WALKING SIX LEAGUES A DAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT FOLLOWED THE LITTER IN HER CARRIAGE
BUT AS IT WAS WORD AGAINST WORD THEY COULD COME TO NO DECISION SO THEY SETTLED TO PUT THE PARTIES ON OATH BUT THE HEADMAN AND THE WOMAN BOTH SWORE THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH SAYING MAY WE DIE IF WE HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY
OH NO SAID VILLEFORT I NEVER CEASED TO SEARCH AND TO INQUIRE HOWEVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS I HAD ALLOWED MYSELF SOME RESPITE BUT NOW I WILL BEGIN WITH MORE PERSEVERANCE AND FURY THAN EVER SINCE FEAR URGES ME NOT MY CONSCIENCE BUT
THE GRASS HAD GROWN VERY THICKLY THERE DURING THE SUMMER AND WHEN AUTUMN ARRIVED NO ONE HAD BEEN THERE TO MOW IT STILL ONE PLACE WHERE THE GRASS WAS THIN ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IT EVIDENTLY WAS THERE I HAD TURNED UP THE GROUND I WENT TO WORK
IF SHE KNEW HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND ALSO WHAT SORT OF CATTLE TO BUY AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER HUSBAND HAD NOT TOLD HER THIS SO THE YOUTH SAID THAT HE WOULD GO TO SINGH CHANDO AND ASK
I DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE STEP BY STEP THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT CONQUER WAS A STRANGE TREMBLING IN MY KNEES I GRASPED THE RAILINGS IF I HAD RELAXED MY HOLD FOR A MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN I REACHED THE LOWER DOOR
AND SINCE MONTE CRISTO SPEAKS BEFORE US OF A CHILD DISINTERRED WHEN THAT CHILD COULD NOT BE FOUND IT IS HE WHO IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET JUST GOD AVENGING GOD MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS
DOUBTLESS IT IS CHANCE CHANCE
NO NO MADAME THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE OH YES HAS NOT A FATAL CHANCE REVEALED ALL THIS WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE HE CAUSED THE EARTH TO BE DUG UP
FIXING HIS EYES MORE STEADFASTLY ON HER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE DID YOU EVER REVEAL TO ANY ONE OUR CONNECTION NEVER TO ANY ONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED VILLEFORT AFFECTIONATELY WHEN I SAY ANY ONE PARDON MY URGENCY
SHE WAS LEFT WELL OFF AND AMONG HER PROPERTY WERE THREE GOLD COINS AND AS SHE WAS AFRAID OF THESE BEING STOLEN SHE DECIDED TO PLACE THEM IN THE CARE OF THE VILLAGE HEADMAN SO SHE TOOK THEM TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO KEEP THEM TILL HER CHILD WAS BORN
AND HE PROMISED AND WENT ON AND CAME TO SINGH CHANDO AND THERE HE ASKED HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND HOW TO BUY CATTLE AND SINGH CHANDO SAID
THENCE I PASSED ON TO THE RHONE WHENCE I DESCENDED MERELY WITH THE CURRENT TO ARLES AT ARLES I WAS AGAIN PLACED ON MY LITTER AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES MY RECOVERY LASTED SIX MONTHS I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTIONED
MY CHILD WAS ALIVE SAID SHE YOU BURIED MY CHILD ALIVE
DIGGING UNDERNEATH THESE TREES FOUND NEITHER SKELETON NOR CHEST BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM WAS THERE NEITHER OF THEM THERE
HIS MOTHER WASHED HIS CLOTHES FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY AND HE SET OUT ON THE WAY HE MET A MAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING AND HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PETITION TO SINGH CHANDO THEN SAID THE MAN MAKE A PETITION FOR ME ALSO
THE VILLAGERS WERE VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT THE HEADMAN AND HIS WIFE ABUSED THEM FOR NOT HAVING BELIEVED THEIR WORD THE WOMAN HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE SHE MET A STRANGER WHO ASKED WHY SHE WAS CRYING AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM HE SAID
I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
AND THEY OBEYED AND FROM THAT TIME HE GREW RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE ADVICE WHICH CHANDO HAD GIVEN TO THE TWO MEN AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
AT THE OFFICE OF THE KING'S ATTORNEY LET US LEAVE THE BANKER DRIVING HIS HORSES AT THEIR FULLEST SPEED
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
SHE GAVE FIVE RUPEES TO THE VILLAGERS AND THEY MADE THE HEADMAN GIVE THEM TEN RUPEES FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEM AND THEY BOUGHT PIGS AND HAD A FEAST IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE BOY GREW UP AND HIS MOTHER URGED HIM TO MARRY HE ASKED HER
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
WHAT THE CORSICAN COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE CHILD A CHILD ENCUMBERS A FUGITIVE PERHAPS ON PERCEIVING IT WAS STILL ALIVE HE HAD THROWN IT INTO THE RIVER
AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SPRING FROM HER CHAIR BUT VILLEFORT STOPPED AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AS IF TO IMPLORE HER ATTENTION WE THOUGHT IT DEAD HE REPEATED I PLACED IT IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A COFFIN I DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN I DUG A HOLE
AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
AND HAD LEFT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE DIRECTED HER COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN WENT DOWN THE RUE MAZARINE AND STOPPED AT THE PASSAGE DU PONT NEUF SHE DESCENDED AND WENT THROUGH THE PASSAGE
SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A WOMAN OF TASTE WALKING IN THE MORNING
AND THE LETTER H TRULY TRULY SAID MADAME DANGLARS ALL MY LINEN IS MARKED THUS MONSIEUR DE NARGONNE WAS A BARONET AND MY NAME IS HERMINE THANK GOD MY CHILD WAS NOT THEN DEAD NO IT WAS NOT DEAD
IF I DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR HEAD OF CATTLE EVERY DAY I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR SO FROM THAT TIME HE LOOKED OUT FOR ANY STRAYING CATTLE AND WOULD DRIVE THEM HOME WITH HIS OWN IF THE OWNER CLAIMED THEM HE GAVE THEM UP
AND TELL THE SECOND MAN TO DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR OF HIS CATTLE EVERY DAY AND THEIR NUMBER WILL DECREASE SO THE YOUTH RETURNED AND MET THE MAN WHO HAD TOO MANY CATTLE AND TOLD HIM WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID AND THE MAN THOUGHT
AND YOU ALMOST DYING YOURSELF CAME TO MEET ME WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENT UPON THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE YOU HAD THE FORTITUDE TO REGAIN THE HOUSE ASSISTED BY YOUR NURSE A DUEL WAS THE PRETEXT FOR MY WOUND
THE MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE USED WHICH WE IN OUR BLINDNESS COULD NOT SEE THEN SEEM SIMPLE AND EASY AND WE SAY WHY DID I NOT DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY ARE RARELY TORMENTED WITH REMORSE
WE KNOW OF NO GOLD COINS WHERE ARE YOUR WITNESSES YOU MUST HAVE HAD WITNESSES IN SUCH A BUSINESS AND THEY DROVE HER OUT SHE WENT AWAY CRYING AND CALLED THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER AND ASKED THEM TO DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY QUESTIONED HER AND THE HEADMAN
AND WHY HE SPEAKS IN OUR PRESENCE OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED IN A GARDEN VILLEFORT PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE COUNT SHUDDER HAD HE HEARD HIM THEN HE PRESSED THE HAND THE BARONESS RELUCTANTLY GAVE HIM AND LED HER RESPECTFULLY BACK TO THE DOOR
HOW IS IT THAT IT HAS ESCAPED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB AND THE RECESSES OF OUR HEARTS WHERE IT WAS BURIED TO VISIT US NOW LIKE A PHANTOM WHITENING OUR CHEEKS AND FLUSHING OUR BROWS WITH SHAME ALAS SAID HERMINE
OUTSIDE THIS DOOR A SPADE WAS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL I TOOK IT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE THICKET I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A DARK LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN I STOPPED TO LIGHT IT THEN I CONTINUED MY PATH
IT IS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT WHAT WE MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE IS AS ARDENTLY WITHHELD FROM US BY THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN IT OR FROM WHOM WE ATTEMPT TO SNATCH IT THUS THE GREATER NUMBER OF A MAN'S ERRORS
I FEEL THAT MY PLACE IS NOT IN THE JUDGE'S SEAT BUT ON THE PRISONER'S STOOL YOU SAID MADAME DANGLARS YES I I THINK SIR YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR SITUATION SAID MADAME DANGLARS WHOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED FOR A MOMENT
THE WORLD EXCUSES AND NOTORIETY ENNOBLES YOU MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO HYPOCRITE OR AT LEAST THAT I NEVER DECEIVE WITHOUT A REASON IF MY BROW BE SEVERE IT IS BECAUSE MANY MISFORTUNES HAVE CLOUDED IT
IS IT NOT BY CHANCE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD WAS DISINTERRED UNDER THE TREES THAT POOR INNOCENT OFFSPRING OF MINE WHICH I NEVER EVEN KISSED BUT FOR WHOM I WEPT MANY MANY TEARS
AND NO ONE WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME BUT THE HEADMAN'S WIFE IN DUE TIME HER CHILD WAS BORN AND BY THE MERCY OF SINGH CHANDO IT WAS A SON AND WHEN THE BOY HAD GROWN A BIT AND COULD RUN ALONE HIS MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE BACK THE GOLD COINS
THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
SO SHE WENT TO THE HEADMAN AND ASKED HIM FOR THEM BUT HE AND HIS WIFE SAID
SO THE WOMAN HASTENED BACK AND FOUND THE VILLAGERS STILL ASSEMBLED AND SHE TOLD THEM AS THE STRANGER HAD DIRECTED AND SHE AGREED TO BE SWORN AGAIN ON THE BODY OF THE CHILD AND THE HEADMAN PROMISED TO PAY FIVE GOLD PIECES IF THE CHILD WERE RESTORED TO LIFE
BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS
AND DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE RUE DE HARLAY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED IN THE VEHICLE SHE DREW FROM HER POCKET A VERY THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH SHE TIED ON TO HER STRAW BONNET SHE THEN REPLACED THE BONNET AND SAW WITH PLEASURE IN A LITTLE POCKET MIRROR
WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
POOR THING SAID VILLEFORT PRESSING HER HAND IT WAS TOO SEVERE FOR YOUR STRENGTH FOR YOU WERE TWICE OVERWHELMED AND YET WELL WELL I MUST TELL YOU COLLECT ALL YOUR COURAGE FOR YOU HAVE NOT YET HEARD ALL
YES DOUBTLESS BUT BELIEVE ME THAT MAN HAS OTHER PROJECTS FOR THAT REASON I WISHED TO SEE YOU TO SPEAK TO YOU TO WARN YOU AGAINST EVERY ONE BUT ESPECIALLY AGAINST HIM TELL ME CRIED VILLEFORT
VILLEFORT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DO I KNOW SAID HE AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF I KNEW
WHEN YOU BUY A BULLOCK FIRST PUT YOUR HAND ON ITS QUARTER AND IF IT SHRINKS AND TRIES TO GET FREE BUY IT AND WHEN YOU WANT A WIFE ENQUIRE FIRST AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER GOOD PARENTS MAKE GOOD CHILDREN
TO ANY ONE LIVING I MEAN YES YES I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL EJACULATED THE BARONESS NEVER I SWEAR TO YOU WERE YOU EVER IN THE HABIT OF WRITING IN THE EVENING WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN THE MORNING DO YOU KEEP A JOURNAL
IF I PLOUGH OVER THE BOUNDARY ON TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S LAND IT WILL BE A GREAT SIN AND I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR AND HE WENT TO HIS PLOUGHMEN AND TOLD THEM NEVER TO PLOUGH RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD BUT TO LEAVE TWO OF THREE FURROWS SPACE
VILLEFORT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A STIFLED GROAN BUT THE CHILD THE CHILD SIR REPEATED THE AGITATED MOTHER HOW I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HIM REPLIED VILLEFORT WRINGING HIS HANDS HOW I HAVE CALLED HIM IN MY LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
I SEEMED EVERYWHERE TO HEAR YOUR MOANS BEHIND ME IN THE BED AND I DARED NOT TURN AROUND MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I FEARED MY WOUND WOULD OPEN AT LENGTH ONE BY ONE
BUT SINCE THEN EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED IN AND ABOUT ME I AM ACCUSTOMED TO BRAVE DIFFICULTIES AND IN THE CONFLICT TO CRUSH THOSE WHO BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL OR BY CHANCE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY INTERFERE WITH ME IN MY CAREER
YOU CAN FEEL FOR MY EMOTION CAN YOU NOT SPARE ME THEN I BESEECH YOU WHEN I LOOK AT THIS ROOM WHENCE SO MANY GUILTY CREATURES HAVE DEPARTED TREMBLING AND ASHAMED WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I NOW SIT TREMBLING AND ASHAMED
FOR THE DECISION DOES NOT COME FROM YOU YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED UPON YOU AND YOUR FAULTS THE RESULTS OF OTHERS CRIMES IN ANY CASE SIR YOU WILL ALLOW REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS
IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALL THE VERDURE OF THE GARDEN HAD DISAPPEARED THE TREES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN SKELETONS WITH THEIR LONG BONY ARMS AND THE DEAD LEAVES SOUNDED ON THE GRAVEL UNDER MY FEET MY TERROR OVERCAME ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS I APPROACHED THE THICKET
WHAT IS THERE MORE TO HEAR YOU ONLY LOOK BACK TO THE PAST AND IT IS INDEED BAD ENOUGH WELL PICTURE TO YOURSELF A FUTURE MORE GLOOMY STILL CERTAINLY FRIGHTFUL PERHAPS SANGUINARY
THOUGH WE SCARCELY EXPECTED IT OUR SECRET REMAINED IN OUR OWN KEEPING ALONE I WAS TAKEN TO VERSAILLES FOR THREE MONTHS I STRUGGLED WITH DEATH AT LAST AS I SEEMED TO CLING TO LIFE I WAS ORDERED TO THE SOUTH
THE MAGISTRATE WAS SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR WRITING WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE AS HE HEARD IT OPEN AND THE DOOR KEEPER PRONOUNCE THE WORDS WALK IN MADAME AND THEN RECLOSE IT
AND THERE THEY LOST HER THEY LOST HER YES FOREVER MADAME DANGLARS HAD LISTENED TO THIS RECITAL WITH A SIGH A TEAR OR A SHRIEK FOR EVERY DETAIL AND THIS IS ALL SAID SHE AND YOU STOPPED THERE
THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE CHILD'S CORPSE COMING EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS RISING FROM THE EARTH AND HOVERING OVER THE GRAVE WITH MENACING LOOK AND GESTURE I INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN TO PARIS THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN INHABITED SINCE WE LEFT IT
I HAD TURNED UP THE EARTH OVER A SURFACE OF MORE THAN TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND A DEPTH OF TWO FEET A LABORER WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN A DAY WHAT OCCUPIED ME AN HOUR BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEN I RENEWED THE SEARCH SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE
ALAS NO I KNOW NOT A WOMAN ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER CAME TO CLAIM IT WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE NAPKIN THIS WOMAN GAVE ALL THE REQUISITE PARTICULARS AND IT WAS INTRUSTED TO HER BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE INQUIRED FOR THE WOMAN YOU SHOULD HAVE TRACED HER
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND DIED WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT AND SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY
A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
THEN THE YOUTH ASKED ABOUT THE TWO MEN HE HAD MET SINGH CHANDO SAID TELL THE FIRST MAN WHEN HE IS PLOUGHING TO PLOUGH TWO OR THREE FURROWS BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF HIS FIELD AND HIS WEALTH WILL DIMINISH
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
THE PATHS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING HAVE BEEN TRACED BY ALL YOUNG MEN OF ARDENT IMAGINATIONS BESIDES THE PLEASURE THERE IS ALWAYS REMORSE FROM THE INDULGENCE OF OUR PASSIONS AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE YOU MEN TO FEAR FROM ALL THIS
BUT IF NO CLAIMANT APPEARED HE KEPT THEM AND SO HE BECAME RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH WENT ON AND MET THE MAN WHO WAS TOO RICH AND WHEN HE HEARD WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID HE THOUGHT
THEN THE VILLAGERS MADE THEM SWEAR BY THEIR CHILDREN AND THE WOMAN AND THE HEADMAN LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEADS OF THEIR SONS AND SWORE AND WHEN THE WOMAN SWORE HER SON FELL DOWN DEAD AND SHE TOOK UP THE DEAD BODY IN HER ARMS AND RAN AWAY WITH IT
THE BARONESS KNEW HOW CALM VILLEFORT NATURALLY WAS AND HIS PRESENT EXCITEMENT FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT THE SOUND DIED IN HER THROAT HOW HAS THIS TERRIBLE PAST BEEN RECALLED CRIED VILLEFORT
DO NOT CRY YOU TOLD ONE FALSEHOOD AND SO YOUR SON HAS DIED TAKE YOUR CHILD BACK TO THE VILLAGERS AND TELL THEM THAT IT WAS FIVE GOLD COINS AND NOT THREE THAT YOU GAVE TO THE HEADMAN AND IF YOU DO THIS THE CHILD WILL COME TO LIFE AGAIN
PERCEIVED THAT TO AVERT THE MATERNAL STORM GATHERING OVER HIS HEAD
NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL GOING ON THAT MORNING AND MANY BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS AT THE PALAIS BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO WOMEN
HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
ONE DAY TWO WILD LOOKING YOUNG MEN CAME OUT OF A TAVERN CLOSE BY THE STAND AND CALLED JERRY HERE CABBY LOOK SHARP WE ARE RATHER LATE PUT ON THE STEAM WILL YOU AND TAKE US TO THE VICTORIA IN TIME FOR THE ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN
THE WESTERN JUNIPER THE JUNIPER OR RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS IS PREEMINENTLY A ROCK TREE
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
YOU SHALL HAVE A SHILLING EXTRA I WILL TAKE YOU AT THE REGULAR PACE GENTLEMEN SHILLINGS DON'T PAY FOR PUTTING ON THE STEAM LIKE THAT LARRY'S CAB WAS STANDING NEXT TO OURS HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND SAID
THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
FOR THERE WAS A WHOLE TRAIN OF CABS AND CARRIAGES ALL GOING OUR WAY AT A QUICK TROT PERHAPS WANTING TO CATCH THAT VERY TRAIN AT ANY RATE WE WHIRLED INTO THE STATION WITH MANY MORE JUST AS THE GREAT CLOCK POINTED TO EIGHT MINUTES TO TWELVE O'CLOCK
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN I GENERALLY GET SAID HE NODDING SLYLY WHAT HE GAVE ME WILL KEEP ME IN LITTLE COMFORTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS GAMMON SAID ONE HE'S A HUMBUG SAID ANOTHER
BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I SHALL BE THE LESS HAPPY FOR THAT I HAVE HEARD THE COMMANDMENTS READ A GREAT MANY TIMES AND I NEVER NOTICED THAT ANY OF THEM SAID THOU SHALT BE RICH AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CURIOUS THINGS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT RICH MEN
COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
AND IF JACK AND I CHOOSE TO HAVE A QUICK RUN NOW AND THEN TO PLEASE OURSELVES THAT'S OUR BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS WELL SAID LARRY YOU'LL NEVER BE A RICH MAN MOST LIKELY NOT SAID JERRY
SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
HE BEGAN CHATTERING YOU YOU YOU WAS ALL I COULD DISTINGUISH AT FIRST SUDDENLY HE DROPPED FROM THE TREE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS HOLDING THE FRONDS APART AND STARING CURIOUSLY AT ME
DRAW NEARER AND YELP WHEN IT CAME TO THE THORNS THEN I HEARD NO MORE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN TO THINK I HAD ESCAPED THE MINUTES PASSED THE SILENCE LENGTHENED OUT AND AT LAST AFTER AN HOUR OF SECURITY MY COURAGE BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME
MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
AND DREW UP ON ONE SIDE TILL THE CRUSH WAS PAST SO GLAD HE SAID SO GLAD POOR YOUNG FELLOW I WONDER WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE HIM SO ANXIOUS JERRY OFTEN TALKED TO HIMSELF QUITE LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR
WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
PREACHING TO US AND THEN DOING THE SAME HIMSELF LOOK HERE MATES SAID JERRY THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED ME HALF A CROWN EXTRA BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT TWAS QUITE PAY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE HOW GLAD HE WAS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
AND SO THEY DID HARRY WAS AS CLEVER AT STABLE WORK AS A MUCH OLDER BOY AND ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT HE COULD THEN POLLY AND DOLLY USED TO COME IN THE MORNING TO HELP WITH THE CAB TO BRUSH AND BEAT THE CUSHIONS
AND AS THEY LED HIM INTO A SHOP HE WALKED AS IF HE WERE IN GREAT PAIN JERRY OF COURSE CAME BACK TO THE STAND BUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES ONE OF THE SHOPMEN CALLED HIM
GOOD LUCK IS RATHER PARTICULAR WHO SHE RIDES WITH AND MOSTLY PREFERS THOSE WHO HAVE GOT COMMON SENSE AND A GOOD HEART AT LEAST THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE GOVERNOR GRAY TURNED ROUND AGAIN TO HIS NEWSPAPER
IT IS A WELL PROPORTIONED RATHER HANDSOME TREE WITH GRAYISH BROWN BARK AND CROOKED MUCH DIVIDED BRANCHES WHICH COVER THE GREATER PART OF THE TRUNK BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN
I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
HAD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE LAYERS OF WOOD BEYOND THIS THE COUNT WAS STOPPED BY DRY ROT AND SCARS THE LARGEST EXAMINED WAS THIRTY THREE FEET IN GIRTH OR NEARLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAILED TO GET ANYTHING LIKE A COMPLETE COUNT
AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
OMNIBUSES CARTS VANS TRUCKS CABS AND GREAT WAGONS CREEPING ALONG AT A WALKING PACE SOME GOING ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER SOME GOING SLOWLY OTHERS WANTING TO PASS THEM OMNIBUSES STOPPING SHORT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO TAKE UP A PASSENGER
AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
HE WAS VERY FOND OF MAKING LITTLE SONGS AND SINGING THEM TO HIMSELF ONE HE WAS VERY FOND OF WAS THIS COME FATHER AND MOTHER AND SISTER AND BROTHER COME ALL OF YOU TURN TO AND HELP ONE ANOTHER
AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU AN EXTRA FARE I'LL DO MY VERY BEST SAID JERRY HEARTILY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH SIR FOR HE LOOKED DREADFULLY WHITE AND ILL I MUST GO HE SAID EARNESTLY
AND YOU WON'T FIND A CURSE COME WITH YOUR WEALTH AS FOR YOU LARRY YOU'LL DIE POOR YOU SPEND TOO MUCH IN WHIPCORD WELL SAID LARRY WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO IF HIS HORSE WON'T GO WITHOUT IT
YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
LEAVING THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES SCARCELY SCARRED THE HEAT HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENT TO KILL THE TREE AND IN A FEW YEARS THE BARK SHRIVELS AND FALLS OFF FORESTS MILES IN EXTENT ARE THUS KILLED AND LEFT STANDING
MY EYES LIT UPON A BLACK FACE WATCHING ME I SAW THAT IT WAS THE SIMIAN CREATURE WHO HAD MET THE LAUNCH UPON THE BEACH HE WAS CLINGING TO THE OBLIQUE STEM OF A PALM TREE I GRIPPED MY STICK AND STOOD UP FACING HIM
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
THERE I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME TOO FEARFUL TO MOVE AND INDEED TOO FEARFUL EVEN TO PLAN A COURSE OF ACTION THE WILD SCENE ABOUT ME LAY SLEEPING SILENTLY UNDER THE SUN
THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
AND MANAGE TO GET TO THE FRONT GOING SO NEAR THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE THAT HALF AN INCH NEARER AND THEY WOULD SCRAPE WELL YOU GET ALONG FOR A BIT BUT SOON FIND YOURSELF IN A LONG TRAIN OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES ALL OBLIGED TO GO AT A WALK
ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
THE TWO LEAVED PINE THE TWO LEAVED PINE PINUS CONTORTA
THEY WERE ALWAYS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR JERRY WOULD SAY IF YOU IN THE MORNING THROW MINUTES AWAY YOU CAN'T PICK THEM UP IN THE COURSE OF A DAY YOU MAY HURRY AND SCURRY AND FLURRY AND WORRY YOU'VE LOST THEM FOREVER FOREVER AND AYE
I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
D'ARTAGNAN AT ONCE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE HE CAST HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE HAND AND TOUCHED IT RESPECTFULLY WITH HIS LIPS
THIS IS FINE SAID PORTHOS TO HIMSELF I AM PRETTILY CAUGHT
AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
AND HELD THEIR STOOLS IN HAND QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN THEIR JAWS MOVED PRELIMINARILY WITH FEARFUL THREATENINGS INDEED THOUGHT PORTHOS CASTING A GLANCE AT THE THREE HUNGRY CLERKS
ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST THE QUEEN ENTERED THE GREAT HALL AND IT WAS REMARKED THAT LIKE THE KING SHE LOOKED DULL AND EVEN WEARY AT THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED THE CURTAIN OF A SMALL GALLERY WHICH TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN CLOSED
THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
BE SATISFIED SAID THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THERE REMAINS THE VALISE ADDED PORTHOS
A SURTOUT OF GRAY PEARL VELVET FASTENED WITH DIAMOND CLASPS AND A PETTICOAT OF BLUE SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER ON HER LEFT SHOULDER SPARKLED THE DIAMOND STUDS ON A BOW OF THE SAME COLOR AS THE PLUMES AND THE PETTICOAT
A HORSE FOR YOUR LACKEY RESUMED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HESITATINGLY
THE QUEEN HAD THEM THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HAD SHE TEN OR TWELVE AT THAT MOMENT THE VIOLINS SOUNDED THE SIGNAL FOR THE BALLET THE KING ADVANCED TOWARD MADAME THE PRESIDENT WITH WHOM HE WAS TO DANCE
AND MONSIEUR AND THE OTHER NOBLES WERE DRESSED LIKE HIM THIS WAS THE COSTUME THAT BEST BECAME THE KING SO DRESSED HE REALLY APPEARED THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF HIS KINGDOM
YOU AT LAST CRIED D'ARTAGNAN SILENCE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACING HER HAND UPON HIS LIPS SILENCE AND GO THE SAME WAY YOU CAME BUT WHERE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
OH OH SAID HE HERE IS A SOUP WHICH IS RATHER INVITING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN THEY SMELL SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SOUP SAID PORTHOS AT THE SIGHT OF A PALE LIQUID ABUNDANT BUT ENTIRELY FREE FROM MEAT
BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE SAW NOTHING BUT EAGER EYES WHICH WERE DEVOURING IN ANTICIPATION THAT SUBLIME FOWL WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPT
BUT QUICK AS A BIRD SHE GLIDED BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND WHEN HE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER HER FINGER PLACED UPON HER MOUTH WITH A LITTLE IMPERATIVE GESTURE FULL OF GRACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS UNDER THE COMMAND OF A POWER WHICH HE MUST BLINDLY OBEY
OUT OF RESPECT WITHDREW SEVERAL STEPS SO THAT NOBODY HAD HEARD ANYTHING THE VIOLINS BEGAN TO SOUND WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT BUT NOBODY LISTENED TO THEM THE KING CAME OUT FIRST FROM HIS ROOM HE WAS IN A MOST ELEGANT HUNTING COSTUME
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
MY HUSBAND HAS FIVE OR SIX VALISES YOU SHALL CHOOSE THE BEST THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE PREFERS IN HIS JOURNEYS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE WORLD YOUR VALISE IS THEN EMPTY ASKED PORTHOS WITH SIMPLICITY
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
THE KING TREMBLED WITH JOY AND THE CARDINAL WITH VEXATION
AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
THEN THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN LEAVING IN HIS AN OBJECT WHICH HE PERCEIVED TO BE A RING THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND D'ARTAGNAN FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY D'ARTAGNAN PLACED THE RING ON HIS FINGER AND AGAIN WAITED
IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
AS IT CAME IN SEARCH OF HIS HE ALSO DRANK HALF A GLASS OF THIS SPARINGLY SERVED WINE AND FOUND IT TO BE NOTHING BUT THAT HORRIBLE MONTREUIL THE TERROR OF ALL EXPERT PALATES
AND THE CLOCK OF SAINT JEAN HAD STRUCK THREE QUARTERS PAST TWO THE SOUND OF VOICES DIMINISHED BY DEGREES IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER THE COMPANY WAS THEN HEARD DEPARTING THEN THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAS OPENED
THE LATTER WISHED TO DETAIN HIM BY DARTING CERTAIN TENDER GLANCES BUT PORTHOS URGED THE COMMANDS OF DUTY AND THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE PLACE TO THE KING
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
AND WHICH FORBADE HIM EVEN TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT AT LENGTH AFTER WINDING ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH EVER SINCE MIDDAY RECKONING THAT THE HEART OR PERHAPS THE STOMACH OF HER LOVER WOULD BRING HIM BEFORE HIS TIME
AND UPON A SIGN FROM HER EVERYONE EAGERLY TOOK HIS SEAT
TO SMOOTH THE YELLOW WRINKLED BROW OF THE OLD PROCURATOR
SERVED HIMSELF IN ABOUT THE SAME PROPORTION
AND TWENTY VIOLINS WERE ORDERED AND THE PRICE FOR THEM FIXED AT DOUBLE THE USUAL RATE UPON CONDITION SAID THE REPORT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PLAYED ALL NIGHT
A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
OH NO SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT EXCEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVRES I EVEN THINK THAT WITH ECONOMY I COULD MANAGE IT WITH TWO THOUSAND LIVRES GOOD GOD CRIED SHE TWO THOUSAND LIVRES
WE ARE COUSINS IT APPEARS MONSIEUR PORTHOS SAID THE PROCURATOR RISING YET SUPPORTING HIS WEIGHT UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CANE CHAIR THE OLD MAN WRAPPED IN A LARGE BLACK DOUBLET
AH MADAME SAID PORTHOS HAUGHTILY DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BEGGAR NO
THE FACE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VELVET MASK BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PRECAUTION WHICH WAS IN FACT TAKEN RATHER AGAINST OTHERS THAN AGAINST HIM HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS USUAL GUIDE THE LIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
I WISHED TO KNOW THE DETAIL SAID SHE BECAUSE HAVING MANY RELATIVES IN BUSINESS I WAS ALMOST SURE OF OBTAINING THINGS AT A HUNDRED PER CENT LESS THAN YOU WOULD PAY YOURSELF AH AH SAID PORTHOS
ENSIGN IN THE KING'S GUARDS FOLLOWED BY TWO OFFICERS AND SEVERAL ARCHERS OF THAT BODY CAME TO THE CITY REGISTRAR NAMED CLEMENT AND DEMANDED OF HIM ALL THE KEYS OF THE ROOMS AND OFFICES OF THE HOTEL
AND THE WORD MAJESTY SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED INDICATED CLEARLY THAT HE WAS IN A CLOSET ATTACHED TO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENT THE YOUNG MAN WAITED IN COMPARATIVE DARKNESS AND LISTENED THE QUEEN APPEARED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY
THIS SUCCOR WHICH CAME TO PORTHOS AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS GASTRONOMIC HOPES INSPIRED MUCH GRATITUDE IN THE MUSKETEER TOWARD THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THE HOUR OF DINNER SOON ARRIVED
BUT WITHDRAWING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK FROM THE CHEST AND FIXING IT UPON PORTHOS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING MONSIEUR OUR COUSIN WILL DO US THE FAVOR OF DINING WITH US ONCE BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE CAMPAIGN WILL HE NOT MADAME COQUENARD
ON HIS PART THE KING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT THERE WAS A MOMENT OF TROUBLE AND CONFUSION IN THE ASSEMBLY EVERYBODY HAD REMARKED THAT SOMETHING HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE KING AND QUEEN BUT BOTH OF THEM HAD SPOKEN SO LOW THAT EVERYBODY
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
THAT WE MUST ENTREAT HIM TO GIVE US EVERY INSTANT HE CAN CALL HIS OWN PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE OH MY LEGS MY POOR LEGS WHERE ARE YOU MURMURED COQUENARD AND HE TRIED TO SMILE
YES MONSIEUR WE ARE COUSINS SAID PORTHOS WITHOUT BEING DISCONCERTED AS HE HAD NEVER RECKONED UPON BEING RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY THE HUSBAND BY THE FEMALE SIDE I BELIEVE SAID THE PROCURATOR MALICIOUSLY
AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
I CAN SEND FOR THEM TO THE LOUVRE WHERE THEY ARE AND THUS YOUR MAJESTY'S WISHES WILL BE COMPLIED WITH DO SO MADAME DO SO AND THAT AT ONCE FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THE BALLET WILL COMMENCE THE QUEEN BENT IN TOKEN OF SUBMISSION
THE TIME FOR WINE CAME
THEN CONTINUED HE THERE IS A HORSE FOR MY LACKEY AND MY VALISE
THE KING THE QUEEN HIS EMINENCE AND HIMSELF THE QUEEN HAD JUST REGAINED HER CHAMBER AND D'ARTAGNAN WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE WHEN HE FELT HIS SHOULDER LIGHTLY TOUCHED HE TURNED AND SAW A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MADE HIM A SIGN TO FOLLOW HER
ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH A FEW CRUSTS SWAM ABOUT AS RARE AS THE ISLANDS OF AN ARCHIPELAGO
THE SAME HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE QUEEN AND MADAME THE PRESIDENT THE NOBLES AND LADIES OF THEIR MAJESTIES SUITES WERE TO DRESS TWO BY TWO IN CHAMBERS PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE
PORTHOS KNOCKED WITH HIS HAND A TALL PALE CLERK HIS FACE SHADED BY A FOREST OF VIRGIN HAIR OPENED THE DOOR AND BOWED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN FORCED AT ONCE TO RESPECT IN ANOTHER LOFTY STATURE WHICH INDICATED STRENGTH
AH BUT THE VALISE I WANT CRIED PORTHOS IS A WELL FILLED ONE MY DEAR MADAME UTTERED FRESH SIGHS MOLIERE HAD NOT WRITTEN HIS SCENE IN L'AVARE THEN
PORTHOS SMILED IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD THE SADDLE WHICH CAME FROM BUCKINGHAM
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
THE BLACK FEET OF THE FOWL AND THE ONLY MUTTON BONE ON WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MEAT PORTHOS FANCIED THEY WERE MYSTIFYING HIM AND BEGAN TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE AND KNIT HIS EYEBROWS
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
EACH HOLDING A FLAMBEAU IN HIS HAND WENT TO ATTEND UPON THE KING WHOM THEY MET ON THE STEPS WHERE THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS MADE HIM THE SPEECH OF WELCOME A COMPLIMENT TO WHICH HIS MAJESTY REPLIED WITH AN APOLOGY FOR COMING SO LATE
THAT'S WELL AS REGARDS MY HORSE BUT I MUST HAVE THE APPOINTMENTS COMPLETE AS THEY INCLUDE OBJECTS WHICH A MUSKETEER ALONE CAN PURCHASE AND WHICH WILL NOT AMOUNT BESIDES TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED LIVRES
PORTHOS DID NOT FEEL THE RIDICULE OF THIS AND TOOK IT FOR A PIECE OF SIMPLICITY AT WHICH HE LAUGHED IN HIS LARGE MUSTACHE
TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
FELT THE WANT OF A SIESTA PORTHOS BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE THING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE PRESENT SITTING AND IN THAT SAME LOCALITY BUT THE PROCURATOR WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO HIS ROOM
LITTERED WITH PAPERS ON QUITTING THE STUDY THEY LEFT THE KITCHEN ON THE RIGHT AND ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM ALL THESE ROOMS WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH ONE ANOTHER DID NOT INSPIRE PORTHOS FAVORABLY WORDS MIGHT BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THROUGH ALL THESE OPEN DOORS
YOU ARE CERTAINLY TREATING YOUR COUSIN VERY HANDSOMELY THE POOR FOWL WAS THIN AND COVERED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK BRISTLY SKINS THROUGH WHICH THE TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE WITH ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE FOWL MUST HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE PERCH
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
THIS TIME PORTHOS RECEIVED THE BLOW RIGHT IN HIS STOMACH AND FELT IT
WHY MADAME HAVE YOU NOT THOUGHT PROPER TO WEAR YOUR DIAMOND STUDS WHEN YOU KNOW IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH GRATIFICATION THE QUEEN CAST A GLANCE AROUND HER AND SAW THE CARDINAL BEHIND WITH A DIABOLICAL SMILE ON HIS COUNTENANCE
WITH THESE WORDS HE HELD OUT TO THE QUEEN THE TWO STUDS THE CARDINAL HAD GIVEN HIM HOW SIRE CRIED THE YOUNG QUEEN AFFECTING SURPRISE YOU ARE GIVING ME THEN TWO MORE I SHALL HAVE FOURTEEN
PORTHOS BIT HIS LIPS BECAUSE HE SAW NOT THE WHEREWITHAL TO DINE HE LOOKED TO SEE IF THE DISH OF BEANS WAS STILL THERE THE DISH OF BEANS HAD DISAPPEARED
THE PROCURATOR HAD WITHOUT DOUBT BEEN WARNED OF HIS VISIT AS HE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EASY AIR AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
TO WHICH IT HAD RETIRED TO DIE OF OLD AGE THE DEVIL THOUGHT PORTHOS THIS IS POOR WORK I RESPECT OLD AGE BUT I DON'T MUCH LIKE IT BOILED OR ROASTED
BUT THE KING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE HE HAD OF LEAVING HIS LADY TO ADVANCE EAGERLY TOWARD THE QUEEN I THANK YOU MADAME SAID HE FOR THE DEFERENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN TO MY WISHES BUT I THINK YOU WANT TWO OF THE STUDS AND I BRING THEM BACK TO YOU
THE VOICE OF THE KING WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANGER EVERYBODY LOOKED AND LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF WHAT PASSED SIRE SAID THE QUEEN
AND THEY REQUIRE MANY THINGS USELESS TO THE GUARDSMEN OR THE SWISS BUT YET DETAIL THEM TO ME WHY THEY MAY AMOUNT TO SAID PORTHOS WHO PREFERRED DISCUSSING THE TOTAL TO TAKING THEM ONE BY ONE
THEY PASSED INTO THE EATING ROOM A LARGE DARK ROOM SITUATED OPPOSITE THE KITCHEN THE CLERKS WHO AS IT APPEARED HAD SMELLED UNUSUAL PERFUMES IN THE HOUSE WERE OF MILITARY PUNCTUALITY
AS NEXT TO THE QUEEN SHE WAS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PERSONAGE OF THE FETE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY THE CITY OFFICIALS AND PLACED IN A BOX OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH THE QUEEN WAS TO OCCUPY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE KING'S COLLATION CONSISTING OF PRESERVES AND OTHER DELICACIES
THE KING OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT TWO DIAMOND STUDS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DEMANDED HE OF THE CARDINAL NOTHING REPLIED THE LATTER ONLY IF THE QUEEN HAS THE STUDS WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT COUNT THEM SIRE
WHICH SEEMED TO ASTONISH THE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HER ALMOST ALWAYS SAD AND FULL OF CARE THE QUEEN ATTRIBUTED THIS JOYOUS FEELING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE FETE
TO WHOM ANNE OF AUSTRIA OWED THE EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER THE CARDINAL AND WHO CONFOUNDED UNKNOWN LOST IN THE CROWD GATHERED AT ONE OF THE DOORS
THEY AROSE SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE FOLDED THEIR NAPKINS MORE SLOWLY STILL BOWED AND RETIRED GO YOUNG MEN GO AND PROMOTE DIGESTION BY WORKING SAID THE PROCURATOR GRAVELY
WELL AGREED FOR A PRETTY MULE SAID PORTHOS YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE SEEN VERY GREAT SPANISH NOBLES WHOSE WHOLE SUITE WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BUT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND MADAME COQUENARD A MULE WITH FEATHERS AND BELLS
CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
BEFORE ENTERING HIS CLOSET THE KING DESIRED TO BE INFORMED THE MOMENT THE CARDINAL ARRIVED HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING FRESH ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD THESE ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN
THAT AT FIRST SIGHT ONE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEM PRETENDED TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT THE CLERKS WERE NOT THE DUPES OF THIS DECEIT AND THEIR LUGUBRIOUS LOOKS SETTLED DOWN INTO RESIGNED COUNTENANCES
HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
THE CITY CARPENTERS HAD ERECTED SCAFFOLDS UPON WHICH THE INVITED LADIES WERE TO BE PLACED THE CITY GROCER HAD ORNAMENTED THE CHAMBERS WITH TWO HUNDRED FLAMBEAUX OF WHITE WAX A PIECE OF LUXURY UNHEARD OF AT THAT PERIOD
ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
AND IN WHICH THEIR MAJESTIES WERE TO DANCE THE FAMOUS LA MERLAISON THE FAVORITE BALLET OF THE KING
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL WAS NOT YET OVER AFTER THE REWARD OF HIS DEVOTION THAT OF HIS LOVE WAS TO COME BESIDES ALTHOUGH THE BALLET WAS DANCED THE EVENING HAD SCARCELY BEGUN SUPPER WAS TO BE SERVED AT THREE
HE SOON DISTINGUISHED HER VOICE FROM THE OTHERS AT FIRST BY A SLIGHTLY FOREIGN ACCENT AND NEXT BY THAT TONE OF DOMINATION NATURALLY IMPRESSED UPON ALL ROYAL WORDS HE HEARD HER APPROACH AND WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM UNCLOSED WITH A CREAK AND PORTHOS PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF OPEN FLAP THE LITTLE CLERK WHO NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE FEAST ATE HIS DRY BREAD IN THE PASSAGE WITH THE DOUBLE ODOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN
BUT OF WHAT THEN DOES THE EQUIPMENT OF YOUR COMPANY CONSIST MONSIEUR PORTHOS OH OF MANY THINGS SAID PORTHOS THE MUSKETEERS ARE AS YOU KNOW PICKED SOLDIERS
THESE KEYS WERE GIVEN UP TO HIM INSTANTLY EACH OF THEM HAD TICKET ATTACHED TO IT BY WHICH IT MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AND FROM THAT MOMENT THE SIEUR DE LA COSTE WAS CHARGED WITH THE CARE OF ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE AVENUES
THAT IS WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY YES DEAR MONSIEUR PORTHOS THUS FOR INSTANCE DON'T YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE WANT A HORSE YES A HORSE WELL THEN I CAN JUST SUIT YOU AH SAID PORTHOS BRIGHTENING
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
MOVED BY A DOUBLE SENTIMENT LOVE AND CURIOSITY ALL THE WAY AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CORRIDORS BECAME MORE DESERTED D'ARTAGNAN WISHED TO STOP THE YOUNG WOMAN SEIZE HER AND GAZE UPON HER WERE IT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
THE QUEEN REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME TO RECEIVE THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE CITY DIGNITARIES AND TO REPLY TO THE SALUTATIONS OF THE LADIES ALL AT ONCE THE KING APPEARED WITH THE CARDINAL AT ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL
NOW SAID HE THE SACRIFICE IS CONSUMMATED AH IF I HAD NOT THE HOPE OF PEEPING WITH MADAME COQUENARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S CHEST
PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
A STRIPLING OF A DOZEN YEARS RISING BEHIND THE THIRD IN ALL THREE CLERKS AND A HALF WHICH FOR THE TIME ARGUED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIENTAGE ALTHOUGH THE MUSKETEER WAS NOT EXPECTED BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
FOR THE ERRAND BOY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE HONORS OF THE MAGISTERIAL TABLE IN MY COUSIN'S PLACE I WOULD NOT KEEP SUCH GOURMANDS THEY LOOK LIKE SHIPWRECKED SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT EATEN FOR SIX WEEKS
FINALLY THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS SUCCESSIVELY DEBATED IN THE SAME MANNER
A PRIVATE ROOM HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING AND ANOTHER FOR MONSIEUR
AND WHICH WERE ALL ILLUMINATED WITH COLORED LANTERNS
WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
AFTER THE SOUP THE MAID BROUGHT A BOILED FOWL A PIECE OF MAGNIFICENCE WHICH CAUSED THE EYES OF THE DINERS TO DILATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY SEEMED READY TO BURST
LAYING THE BLAME UPON THE CARDINAL WHO HAD DETAINED HIM TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TALKING OF AFFAIRS OF STATE HIS MAJESTY IN FULL DRESS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
BUT SOON A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THROUGH THE CHAMBER TOGETHER WITH THE WARM AND PERFUMED AIR WHICH REACHED HIM FROM THE SAME APERTURE THE CONVERSATION OF TWO OF THREE LADIES IN LANGUAGE AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND REFINED
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
THESE CONDITIONS BEING AGREED TO
WAS PREPARED IN THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JEAN IN FRONT OF THE SILVER BUFFET OF THE CITY WHICH WAS GUARDED BY FOUR ARCHERS AT MIDNIGHT GREAT CRIES AND LOUD ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD IT WAS THE KING
OR WITH ULYSSES FATHER JOVE ANSWERED THE STOCKMAN WOULD INDEED
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
THAT ARE OVER AGAINST ELIS WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO LET ANY ONE HAVE THE BOW OR TO REFUSE IT NO ONE SHALL FORCE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOT EVEN THOUGH I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE STRANGER A PRESENT OF THE BOW OUTRIGHT AND LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY WITH HIM
THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND AND STILL EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE KILLED THEN ULYSSES SEARCHED THE WHOLE COURT CAREFULLY OVER TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD MANAGED TO HIDE HIMSELF AND WAS STILL LIVING
IN THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE DOMED ROOM AND THAT OF THE YARD SO THAT THEY COULD NOT GET AWAY AND TELEMACHUS SAID TO THE OTHER TWO I SHALL NOT LET THESE WOMEN DIE A CLEAN DEATH
IT IS TIME FOR THE ACHAEANS TO PREPARE SUPPER WHILE THERE IS STILL DAYLIGHT AND THEN OTHERWISE TO DISPORT THEMSELVES WITH SONG AND DANCE WHICH ARE THE CROWNING ORNAMENTS OF A BANQUET
AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH HIM BY ULYSSES WHEN HE SAILED FOR TROY HE HAD USED IT SO LONG AS HE HAD BEEN AT HOME BUT HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AS HAVING BEEN A KEEPSAKE FROM A VALUED FRIEND
AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
BUT KILLED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND KEPT THE MARES HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN CLAIMING THESE
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
I WILL NOW GIVE YOU CONVINCING PROOFS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ME AND BE ASSURED SEE HERE IS THE SCAR FROM THE BOAR'S TOOTH THAT RIPPED ME WHEN I WAS OUT HUNTING ON MT PARNASSUS
WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
THERE WAS A SHIP'S CABLE OF BYBLUS FIBRE LYING IN THE GATEHOUSE SO HE MADE THE GATES FAST WITH IT AND THEN CAME IN AGAIN RESUMING THE SEAT THAT HE HAD LEFT AND KEEPING AN EYE ON ULYSSES WHO HAD NOW GOT THE BOW IN HIS HANDS
LET ANOTHER HAVE IT THIS BOW SHALL TAKE THE LIFE AND SOUL OUT OF MANY A CHIEF AMONG US FOR IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE AFTER HAVING MISSED THE PRIZE THAT WE HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR AND WHICH HAS BROUGHT US SO LONG TOGETHER
FROM WHAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE AND THE SUITORS WARMED THE BOW AND AGAIN MADE TRIAL OF IT BUT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM NEARLY STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING IT NEVERTHELESS
HOLD HE CRIED THE MAN IS GUILTLESS DO HIM NO HURT AND WE WILL SPARE MEDON TOO WHO WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME WHEN I WAS A BOY UNLESS
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
SO EUMAEUS BROUGHT THE BOW ON AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE CALLED EURYCLEA APART AND SAID TO HER
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
THAT YOU ARE SO LAMENTABLY LESS VALIANT NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN GROUND FACE TO FACE WITH THE SUITORS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE COME ON MY GOOD FELLOW STAND BY MY SIDE AND SEE HOW MENTOR
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
WHO WAS WARMING IT BY THE FIRE BUT EVEN SO HE COULD NOT STRING IT AND HE WAS GREATLY GRIEVED HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID
MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW AND GET THIS CONTEST SETTLED ON THIS HE PUT THE BOW DOWN LETTING IT LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE HOUSE WITH THE ARROW STANDING AGAINST THE TOP OF THE BOW
TELEMACHUS SAYS YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY ARE NOT TO COME OUT BUT ARE TO KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK
WHO WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THE OFFENDING LIES LOW ALREADY IT WAS ALL HIS DOING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY PENELOPE HE DID NOT SO MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND JOVE
THOUGH HE HAD HOPED TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON HE WAS TRYING FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WOULD HAVE STRUNG IT HAD NOT ULYSSES MADE A SIGN TO CHECK HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EAGERNESS SO HE SAID ALAS
STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
IF APOLLO AND THE OTHER GODS WILL GRANT OUR PRAYER YOUR OWN BOARHOUNDS SHALL GET YOU INTO SOME QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND WORRY YOU TO DEATH EUMAEUS WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE OUTCRY THEY ALL RAISED
ANTINOUS SAID SHE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD ILL TREAT ANY GUEST OF TELEMACHUS WHO COMES TO THIS HOUSE IF THE STRANGER SHOULD PROVE STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES
COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
FIERCE AND FULL OF FURY NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT WERE STILL BOTH BRAVE AND MANY THEN
AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
WE WILL KILL YOU TOO YOU SHALL PAY FOR IT WITH YOUR HEAD AND WHEN WE HAVE KILLED YOU WE WILL TAKE ALL YOU HAVE IN DOORS OR OUT AND BRING IT INTO HOTCH POT WITH ULYSSES PROPERTY
WHO WAS ABOUT TO TAKE UP A TWO HANDLED GOLD CUP TO DRINK HIS WINE AND ALREADY HAD IT IN HIS HANDS HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEATH WHO AMONGST ALL THE REVELLERS WOULD THINK THAT ONE MAN HOWEVER BRAVE
AT THIS MOMENT THE BOW
THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THEIR OFFERINGS AND HAD DRUNK EACH AS MUCH AS HE DESIRED ULYSSES CRAFTILY SAID SUITORS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN LISTEN THAT I MAY SPEAK EVEN AS I AM MINDED
AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
IF SOME GOD WERE BUT TO BRING ULYSSES BACK YOU SHOULD SEE WITH WHAT MIGHT AND MAIN I WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IN LIKE WORDS EUMAEUS PRAYED TO ALL THE GODS THAT ULYSSES MIGHT RETURN WHEN THEREFORE
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
FOR THEY FEARED HE MIGHT STRING THE BOW ANTINOUS THEREFORE REBUKED HIM FIERCELY SAYING WRETCHED CREATURE YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A GRAIN OF SENSE IN YOUR WHOLE BODY YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
AND REQUITE YOUR KINDNESSES CONFERRED UPON HIM BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM FULL VICTORY AS YET FOR SHE WISHED STILL FURTHER TO PROVE HIS OWN PROWESS AND THAT OF HIS BRAVE SON
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES
BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
ABOVE HIS SHIELD BUT THE SPEAR WENT ON AND FELL TO THE GROUND THEN ULYSSES AND HIS MEN LET DRIVE INTO THE CROWD OF SUITORS
GET SPONGES AND CLEAN WATER TO SWILL DOWN THE TABLES AND SEATS WHEN YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED THE WHOLE CLOISTERS TAKE THE WOMEN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOMED ROOM AND THE WALL OF THE OUTER COURT AND RUN THEM THROUGH WITH YOUR SWORDS
IF YOU ARE ULYSSES SAID HE THEN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS JUST WE HAVE DONE MUCH WRONG ON YOUR LANDS AND IN YOUR HOUSE
THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
YET I AM LAUGHING AND ENJOYING MYSELF AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING HAPPENING BUT SUITORS AS THE CONTEST HAS BEEN AGREED UPON LET IT GO FORWARD IT IS FOR A WOMAN WHOSE PEER IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN PYLOS
BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
FOR SOME GOD HAS BEEN SENDING HER TO SLEEP DO NOT WAKE HER YET ANSWERED ULYSSES BUT TELL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES TO COME TO ME
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
O SWINEHERD EUMAEUS SAYING MELANTHIUS YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT ON A SOFT BED AS YOU DESERVE
BUT LET US SEE WHETHER YOU CAN STRING THE BOW OR NO I TOO WILL MAKE TRIAL OF IT FOR IF I CAN STRING IT AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON I SHALL NOT SUFFER MY MOTHER TO QUIT THIS HOUSE WITH A STRANGER
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
FOR THE SWINEHERD AND THE STOCKMAN FOR WE HAD BETTER BE ARMED RUN AND FETCH THEM ANSWERED ULYSSES WHILE MY ARROWS HOLD OUT OR WHEN I AM ALONE THEY MAY GET ME AWAY FROM THE DOOR
HAS NOT VOUCHSAFED IT TO HIM HE WANTED TO KILL YOUR SON AND TO BE CHIEF MAN IN ITHACA NOW THEREFORE THAT HE HAS MET THE DEATH WHICH WAS HIS DUE SPARE THE LIVES OF YOUR PEOPLE
NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
THOUGH YOU SHOULD GIVE ME ALL THAT YOU HAVE IN THE WORLD BOTH NOW AND ALL THAT YOU EVER SHALL HAVE I WILL NOT STAY MY HAND TILL I HAVE PAID ALL OF YOU IN FULL YOU MUST FIGHT OR FLY FOR YOUR LIVES AND FLY
AND ARMED HIMSELF FIRST WHILE THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD ALSO PUT ON THEIR ARMOUR AND TOOK THEIR PLACES NEAR ULYSSES MEANWHILE ULYSSES AS LONG AS HIS ARROWS LASTED HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE SUITORS ONE BY ONE
TO MAKE THE SUITORS TRY THEIR SKILL WITH THE BOW AND WITH THE IRON AXES IN CONTEST AMONG THEMSELVES AS A MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT THEIR DESTRUCTION SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND GOT THE STORE ROOM KEY WHICH WAS MADE OF BRONZE AND HAD A HANDLE OF IVORY
HE SHED THE ARROWS ON TO THE GROUND AT HIS FEET AND SAID THE MIGHTY CONTEST IS AT AN END I WILL NOW SEE WHETHER APOLLO WILL VOUCHSAFE IT TO ME TO HIT ANOTHER MARK WHICH NO MAN HAS YET HIT
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY MUST NOT COME OUT THEY MUST KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK AND I CHARGE YOU
AND DISHONOURING HIS HOUSE MUST NOT EXPECT OTHERS TO THINK WELL OF THEM WHY THEN SHOULD YOU MIND IF MEN TALK AS YOU THINK THEY WILL THIS STRANGER IS STRONG AND WELL BUILT HE SAYS MOREOVER
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
SO THEY MADE ME TELEMACHUS HEARD HIM
SO HE PUT THE BOW DOWN THEN AND THERE BUT TELEMACHUS SHOUTED OUT AT HIM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLOISTERS AND THREATENED HIM SAYING FATHER EUMAEUS BRING THE BOW ON IN SPITE OF THEM
THAN THAT YOU WANT TO MARRY ME THIS THEN BEING THE PRIZE THAT YOU ARE CONTENDING FOR I WILL BRING OUT THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES AND WHOMSOEVER OF YOU SHALL STRING IT MOST EASILY
FROM HIS ARROWS LET US HAVE AT HIM WITH A RUSH TO DRIVE HIM FROM THE PAVEMENT AND DOORWAY WE CAN THEN GET THROUGH INTO THE TOWN AND RAISE SUCH AN ALARM AS SHALL SOON STAY HIS SHOOTING
YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
THIS DONE HE WENT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW THRICE DID HE TUG AT IT TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO DRAW THE STRING AND THRICE HE HAD TO LEAVE OFF
THE TWO FELL IN WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MESSENE AT THE HOUSE OF ORTILOCHUS
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
SHE WENT WONDERING BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND LAID HER SON'S SAYING IN HER HEART THEN GOING UPSTAIRS WITH HER HANDMAIDS INTO HER ROOM SHE MOURNED HER DEAR HUSBAND TILL MINERVA SENT SWEET SLEEP OVER HER EYELIDS
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
KILLED IPHITUS ERE THEY COULD DO SO THIS BOW THEN
THEN CAUGHT THE KNEES OF ULYSSES AND SAID ULYSSES I BESEECH YOU HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND SPARE ME
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
AND WAS TURNING IT EVERY WAY ABOUT AND PROVING IT ALL OVER TO SEE WHETHER THE WORMS HAD BEEN EATING INTO ITS TWO HORNS DURING HIS ABSENCE THEN WOULD ONE TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR SAYING
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
BY KILLING US OUTRIGHT THEY THEREFORE AIMED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THREW THEIR SPEARS ULYSSES KILLED DEMOPTOLEMUS TELEMACHUS EURYADES EUMAEUS ELATUS
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
HE WAS TO BE THE FIRST THAT SHOULD TASTE OF THE ARROWS FROM THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHOM HE WAS DISHONOURING IN HIS OWN HOUSE
HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
SHE THEN WENT WITH HER MAIDENS INTO THE STORE ROOM AT THE END OF THE HOUSE WHERE HER HUSBAND'S TREASURES OF GOLD BRONZE AND WROUGHT IRON WERE KEPT AND WHERE WAS ALSO HIS BOW AND THE QUIVER FULL OF DEADLY ARROWS THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY A FRIEND
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
HIS TABLE THE CUP AND ALL THE MEATS WENT OVER ON TO THE GROUND AS HE SMOTE THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD IN THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND HE KICKED THE STOOL WITH HIS FEET UNTIL HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN DARKNESS
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
MY FRIENDS THIS MAN WILL GIVE US NO QUARTER
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
AND THEY DID EVEN AS HE HAD SAID THEY WENT TO THE STORE ROOM WHICH THEY ENTERED BEFORE MELANTHIUS SAW THEM FOR HE WAS BUSY SEARCHING FOR ARMS IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE ROOM SO THE TWO TOOK THEIR STAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AND WAITED
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY CLEANED ALL THE TABLES AND SEATS WITH SPONGES AND WATER WHILE TELEMACHUS AND THE TWO OTHERS SHOVELLED UP THE BLOOD AND DIRT FROM THE GROUND AND THE WOMEN CARRIED IT ALL AWAY
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
IN BEING ALLOWED TO DINE UNHARMED AMONG YOUR BETTERS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SMALLER PORTION SERVED YOU THAN WE OTHERS HAVE HAD AND IN BEING ALLOWED TO HEAR OUR CONVERSATION
WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
THAT COLLISHAW'S DEAD NOR IF ONE HAD HIS NECK BROKEN AND THE OTHER WAS POISONED BUT WHOSE HAND WAS THAT WHICH THE MASON VARNER SAW THAT MORNING WHEN BRAKE WAS FLUNG OUT OF THAT DOORWAY COME NOW WHOSE
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
THE TWO OR THREE CHAIRS WERE DEEP AND BIG ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN THE TWO WINDOWS COMMANDED PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS ON ONE SIDE AND OF THE CLOSE ON THE OTHER NICE LITTLE PLACE TO BE ALONE IN D'YE SEE SAID FOLLIOT
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
BEFORE TESTING THE LIFE OF A CONVICT ESTABLISHMENT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME TALK OF SENDING HIM TO PARKHURST AND HERE HE TRACED THE INFLUENCE WHICH T X WOULD EXERCISE FOR PARKHURST WAS A PRISONER'S PARADISE
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
AS LEXMAN GATHERED FROM A GLIMPSE OF THE CREW BY GREEKS HE SCRAMBLED ABOARD AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE WAS STANDING ON THE WHITE DECK OF THE YACHT WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING TAIL OF THE MONOPLANE KARA WAS BY HIS SIDE
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
BRYCE WHO HAD LIGHTED A CIGAR LOOKED ACROSS ITS SMOKE AT THE IMPERTURBABLE FACE OPPOSITE YOU'VE JUST HAD GLASSDALE HERE HE OBSERVED QUIETLY I SAW HIM LEAVE YOU
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
A SHARP EXCLAMATION FROM HIM TOOK BRYCE TO HIS SIDE FOLLIOT LIFTED A SHAKING HAND AND POINTED INTO THE GARDEN THERE HE WHISPERED HELL AND WHAT'S THIS MEAN
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HORSES BUT ONLY A GREAT BAT LIKE MACHINE WITH OUT STRETCHED PINIONS OF TAUT WHITE CANVAS AND BY THAT MACHINE
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
YOU HAVEN'T TIME FOR ARGUMENT THEY DISCOVERED YOUR ESCAPE HE SAID GET IN JOHN CLAMBERED UP INTO THE FRAIL BODY OF THE MACHINE AND KARA FOLLOWED THIS IS A SELF STARTER HE SAID ONE OF THE NEWEST MODELS OF MONOPLANES
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
MY GOD HE WHISPERED DO AS I TELL YOU HISSED THE WARDER LIKE AN AUTOMATON JOHN PUT DOWN HIS BRUSHES AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE GATE THE GREY CAR WAS CRAWLING UP THE HILL
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN PROVE EASILY THAT I NEVER DID MEET HIM I CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THAT DAY AS TO THE OTHER AFFAIR NOT AN OUNCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE THEN IT WAS THE OTHER MAN EXCLAIMED BRYCE
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
YOU'D HAVE A JOB TO GET IT RETORTED FOLLIOT SUPPOSING THAT ALL YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT ABOUT PAST MATTERS NOTHING CAN PROVE NOTHING
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
BUT NEITHER YOU NOR THE POLICE NOR ANYBODY COULD FASTEN ME TO EITHER MATTER GRANTING ALL YOU SAY TO BE TRUE WHERE'S THE POSITIVE TRUTH WHAT ABOUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ASKED BRYCE
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
LOTS ANSWERED BRYCE I CAME TO TELL YOU ON SEEING THAT GLASSDALE HAD BEEN WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH GLASSDALE THIS MORNING FOLLIOT MADE NO ANSWER
IF I HAVE MY PRICE IT'S NOT IN THE SAME COMMODITY THAT GLASSDALE WOULD WANT BUT BEFORE WE DO ANY TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING I WANT TO ADD TO MY STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE LOOK HERE WE'LL BE CANDID I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGERS THAT BRAKE
FROM TIME TO TIME HE CONSULTED THE COMPASS ON THE BOARD BEFORE HIM AND CHANGED HIS COURSE EVER SO SLIGHTLY PRESENTLY HE RELEASED ONE HAND FROM THE DRIVING WHEEL AND SCRIBBLING ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF PAPER WHICH WAS INSERTED IN A POCKET
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
NEVER ONCE DID HE FEEL THE CAR SLACKEN ITS PACE UNTIL WITH A GRIND OF BRAKES IT STOPPED SUDDENLY GET OUT SAID A VOICE JOHN LEXMAN THREW OFF THE COVER AND LEAPT OUT AND AS HE DID SO
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
HE WANTED TO FIND THOSE TWO MEN AND BEGAN A LONG SEARCH FOR THEM LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEN MISTER FOLLIOT YOU MIGHT MENTION EM IF YOU KNOW EM ANSWERED FOLLIOT THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR ONE WAS WRAYE FALKINER WRAYE
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
WHEN THAT CAR COMES ABREAST OF THE GATE ASK NO QUESTIONS AND JUMP INTO IT GET DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM AND PULL A SACK OVER YOU AND DO NOT GET UP UNTIL THE CAR STOPS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO JOHN LEXMAN'S HEAD AND HE STAGGERED
FOLLIOT NODDED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AYE DOCTOR HE SAID AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GLASSDALE NOW BRYCE WHO WOULD HAVE CHEERFULLY HOBNOBBED WITH A MAN
BUT IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALL SIGNS OF THE LAND WERE BLOTTED OUT TALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAR OF THE ENGINES DEFIED PENETRATION KARA WAS EVIDENTLY A SKILFUL PILOT
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
AND HAD CARRIED HIS OWN GLASS TO ANOTHER EASY CHAIR DID FOLLIOT REFER TO ANY REASON FOR BRYCE'S VISIT BUT ONCE SETTLED DOWN HE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SEE YOU BUT I KNOW WHAT PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD I GAVE HIM COPIES OF THOSE TWO REWARD BILLS HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT HE MIGHT MAKE A BIT AND SO HE CAME IN TO TOWN AND TO YOU WELL ASKED FOLLIOT
WITH A GLANCE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DEEPEST WELL IN ALL WRYCHESTER UNDER THAT HE REMARKED YOU'D NEVER THINK IT IT'S A HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND MORE DRY NOW
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
BEFORE THE SECOND MAN SPOKE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE MURDER SAID JOHN LEXMAN LACONICALLY HE HAD ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
NOT MINE MY LAD ANSWERED FOLLIOT CONFIDENTLY THAT'S A FACT BRYCE HESITATED GIVING FOLLIOT A SEARCHING LOOK AND FOLLIOT NODDED SOLEMNLY I TELL YOU NOT MINE HE REPEATED I'D NAUGHT TO DO WITH IT
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
COOL IN SUMMER WARM IN WINTER MODERN FIRE GRATE YOU NOTICE
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
PASSING THROUGH DRIFTING CLOUDS
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
FORTUNATE FOR YOU MISTER FOLLIOT THAT THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ALL THAT I KNOW FOR IF THEY DID THOSE MARKS WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU DAYS AGO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOLLIOT SAT JOGGLING HIS LEG A BAD SIGN IN HIM OF RISING TEMPER
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH I HERE SET DOWN ARE SUCH AS DO NATURALLY TAKE THE SENSE AND NOT RESPECT PETTY WONDERMENTS IT IS TRUE THE ALTERATIONS OF SCENES SO IT BE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT NOISE ARE THINGS OF GREAT BEAUTY AND PLEASURE
IN PASSION FOR THAT PUTTETH A MAN OUT OF HIS PRECEPTS AND IN A NEW CASE OR EXPERIMENT FOR THERE CUSTOM LEAVETH HIM THEY ARE HAPPY MEN WHOSE NATURES SORT WITH THEIR VOCATIONS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SAY
A GENERAL CUSTOM OF SIMULATION WHICH IS THIS LAST DEGREE IS A VICE USING EITHER OF A NATURAL FALSENESS OR FEARFULNESS OR OF A MIND THAT HATH SOME MAIN FAULTS WHICH BECAUSE A MAN MUST NEEDS DISGUISE
PORTAS ET FORTUNAM EJUS SO SYLLA CHOSE THE NAME OF FELIX AND NOT OF MAGNUS AND IT HATH BEEN NOTED THAT THOSE WHO ASCRIBE OPENLY TOO MUCH TO THEIR OWN WISDOM AND POLICY
ONLY SUPERSTITION IS NOW SO WELL ADVANCED THAT MEN OF THE FIRST BLOOD ARE AS FIRM AS BUTCHERS BY OCCUPATION AND VOTARY RESOLUTION IS MADE EQUIPOLLENT TO CUSTOM EVEN IN MATTER OF BLOOD
BUT IN PRIVATE REVENGES IT IS NOT SO NAY RATHER VINDICTIVE PERSONS LIVE THE LIFE OF WITCHES WHO AS THEY ARE MISCHIEVOUS SO END THEY INFORTUNATE
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE HORSES WELL MANAGED FOR THEY COULD TELL PASSING WELL WHEN TO STOP OR TURN AND AT SUCH TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE CASE INDEED REQUIRED DISSIMULATION IF THEN THEY USED IT IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FORMER OPINION SPREAD ABROAD
SAILED THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT OCEAN IN AN EARTHEN POT OR PITCHER LIVELY DESCRIBING CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION THAT SAILETH IN THE FRAIL BARK OF THE FLESH THROUGH THE WAVES OF THE WORLD BUT TO SPEAK IN A MEAN
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM COPULATE AND CONJOINED AND COLLEGIATE IS FAR GREATER FOR THERE EXAMPLE TEACHETH COMPANY COMFORTETH EMULATION QUICKENETH GLORY RAISETH SO AS IN SUCH PLACES
AND DISSIMULATION TO TIBERIUS
AND ASSUREDLY THE SECRET MAN HEARETH MANY CONFESSIONS FOR WHO WILL OPEN HIMSELF TO A BLAB OR A BABBLER BUT IF A MAN BE THOUGHT SECRET IT INVITETH DISCOVERY AS THE MORE CLOSE AIR SUCKETH IN THE MORE OPEN
IN SUCH A COMPANY AS THERE IS STEAM AND HEAT THINGS OF GREAT PLEASURE AND REFRESHMENT DOUBLE MASQUES ONE OF MEN ANOTHER OF LADIES ADDETH STATE AND VARIETY BUT ALL IS NOTHING EXCEPT THE ROOM BE KEPT CLEAR AND NEAT
BUT MEMORY MERIT AND NOBLE WORKS ARE PROPER TO MEN AND SURELY A MAN SHALL SEE THE NOBLEST WORKS AND FOUNDATIONS HAVE PROCEEDED FROM CHILDLESS MEN WHICH HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THE IMAGES OF THEIR MINDS WHERE THOSE OF THEIR BODIES HAVE FAILED
USE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO PROVIDENCE AND FORTUNE FOR SO THEY MAY THE BETTER ASSUME THEM AND BESIDES IT IS GREATNESS IN A MAN TO BE THE CARE OF THE HIGHER POWERS SO CAESAR SAID TO THE PILOT IN THE TEMPEST
BECAUSE THEIR MEANS ARE LESS EXHAUST YET ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE MORE CRUEL AND HARDHEARTED GOOD TO MAKE SEVERE INQUISITORS BECAUSE THEIR TENDERNESS IS NOT SO OFT CALLED UPON
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS UNFIT BUT CHIEFLY LET THE MUSIC OF THEM BE RECREATIVE AND WITH SOME STRANGE CHANGES SOME SWEET ODORS SUDDENLY COMING FORTH WITHOUT ANY DROPS FALLING ARE
A WISE SON REJOICETH THE FATHER BUT AN UNGRACIOUS SON SHAMES THE MOTHER A MAN SHALL SEE WHERE THERE IS A HOUSE FULL OF CHILDREN ONE OR TWO OF THE ELDEST RESPECTED AND THE YOUNGEST MADE WANTONS BUT IN THE MIDST
WILL ALSO TALK WHAT HE KNOWETH NOT THEREFORE SET IT DOWN THAT AN HABIT OF SECRECY IS BOTH POLITIC AND MORAL AND IN THIS PART IT IS GOOD THAT A MAN'S FACE GIVE HIS TONGUE LEAVE TO SPEAK
IN FEW WORDS MYSTERIES ARE DUE TO SECRECY BESIDES TO SAY TRUTH NAKEDNESS IS UNCOMELY AS WELL IN MIND AS BODY
NOT SO MUCH IN DOING THE HURT AS IN MAKING THE PARTY REPENT BUT BASE AND CRAFTY COWARDS ARE LIKE THE ARROW THAT FLIETH IN THE DARK
AND LET THEM NOT TOO MUCH APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR CHILDREN AS THINKING THEY WILL TAKE BEST TO THAT
OF NATURE IN MEN NATURE IS OFTEN HIDDEN SOMETIMES OVERCOME SELDOM EXTINGUISHED FORCE MAKETH NATURE MORE VIOLENT IN THE RETURN DOCTRINE AND DISCOURSE
SEVERAL QUIRES PLACED ONE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER AND TAKING THE VOICE BY CATCHES ANTHEM WISE GIVE GREAT PLEASURE TURNING DANCES INTO FIGURE IS A CHILDISH CURIOSITY AND GENERALLY LET IT BE NOTED
THE WAY OF FORTUNE IS LIKE THE MILKEN WAY IN THE SKY WHICH IS A MEETING OR KNOT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL STARS NOT SEEN ASUNDER BUT GIVING LIGHT TOGETHER
YET THEIR THOUGHTS DO END WITH THEMSELVES AND ACCOUNT FUTURE TIMES IMPERTINENCES NAY THERE ARE SOME OTHER THAT ACCOUNT WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT AS BILLS OF CHARGES NAY MORE
AND AS IN CONFESSION THE REVEALING IS NOT FOR WORLDLY USE BUT FOR THE EASE OF A MAN'S HEART SO SECRET MEN COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS IN THAT KIND WHILE MEN RATHER DISCHARGE THEIR MINDS THAN IMPART THEIR MINDS
FOR COMMONWEALTHS AND GOOD GOVERNMENTS DO NOURISH VIRTUE GROWN BUT DO NOT MUCH MEND THE DEEDS BUT THE MISERY IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS ARE NOW APPLIED TO THE ENDS LEAST TO BE DESIRED
BUT YOU NEVER READ THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR FRIENDS BUT YET THE SPIRIT OF JOB WAS IN A BETTER TUNE
AND IT ADDETH NO SMALL REVERENCE TO MEN'S MANNERS AND ACTIONS IF THEY BE NOT ALTOGETHER OPEN AS FOR TALKERS AND FUTILE PERSONS THEY ARE COMMONLY VAIN AND CREDULOUS WITHAL FOR HE THAT TALKETH WHAT HE KNOWETH
LET THE SUITS OF THE MASQUERS BE GRACEFUL AND SUCH AS BECOME THE PERSON WHEN THE VIZORS ARE OFF NOT AFTER EXAMPLES OF KNOWN ATTIRES TURKE SOLDIERS MARINERS AND THE LIKE
SHOULD HAVE GREATEST CARE OF FUTURE TIMES UNTO WHICH THEY KNOW THEY MUST TRANSMIT THEIR DEAREST PLEDGES SOME THERE ARE WHO THOUGH THEY LEAD A SINGLE LIFE
FOR THE FIRST WILL MAKE HIM DEJECTED BY OFTEN FAILINGS AND THE SECOND WILL MAKE HIM A SMALL PROCEEDER THOUGH BY OFTEN PREVAILINGS AND AT THE FIRST LET HIM PRACTISE WITH HELPS AS SWIMMERS DO WITH BLADDERS OR RUSHES
IN CREATING AND BREEDING AN EMULATION BETWEEN BROTHERS DURING CHILDHOOD WHICH MANY TIMES SORTETH TO DISCORD WHEN THEY ARE MEN AND DISTURBETH FAMILIES
THE BEST COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE IS TO HAVE OPENNESS IN FAME AND OPINION SECRECY IN HABIT DISSIMULATION IN SEASONABLE USE AND A POWER TO FEIGN IF THERE BE NO REMEDY
THE FRENCH HATH IT BETTER ENTREPRENANT OR REMUANT BUT THE EXERCISED FORTUNE MAKETH THE ABLE MAN FORTUNE IS TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED
THERE ARE SOME FOOLISH RICH COVETOUS MEN THAT TAKE A PRIDE IN HAVING NO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THOUGHT SO MUCH THE RICHER FOR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD SOME TALK SUCH AN ONE IS A GREAT RICH MAN
REVENGE IS A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE WHICH THE MORE MAN'S NATURE RUNS TO THE MORE OUGHT LAW TO WEED IT OUT FOR AS FOR THE FIRST WRONG IT DOTH BUT OFFEND THE LAW
BUT YET SINCE PRINCES WILL HAVE SUCH THINGS IT IS BETTER THEY SHOULD BE GRACED WITH ELEGANCY THAN DAUBED WITH COST DANCING TO SONG IS A THING OF GREAT STATE AND PLEASURE I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE SONG BE IN QUIRE
FOR SOLDIERS I FIND THE GENERALS COMMONLY IN THEIR HORTATIVES PUT MEN IN MIND OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND I THINK THE DESPISING OF MARRIAGE AMONGST THE TURKS MAKETH THE VULGAR SOLDIER MORE BASE
THE DEGREES HAD NEED BE FIRST TO STAY AND ARREST NATURE IN TIME LIKE TO HIM THAT WOULD SAY OVER THE FOUR AND TWENTY LETTERS WHEN HE WAS ANGRY THEN TO GO LESS IN QUANTITY AS IF ONE SHOULD IN FORBEARING WINE
THEREFORE EXTREME LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY OR MASTERS WERE NEVER FORTUNATE NEITHER CAN THEY BE FOR WHEN A MAN PLACETH HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT HIMSELF HE GOETH NOT HIS OWN WAY AN HASTY FORTUNE MAKETH AN ENTERPRISER AND REMOVER
CERTAINLY THE ABLEST MEN THAT EVER WERE HAVE HAD ALL AN OPENNESS AND FRANKNESS OF DEALING
AND WHAT TO BE SHOWED AT HALF LIGHTS AND TO WHOM AND WHEN WHICH INDEED ARE ARTS OF STATE AND ARTS OF LIFE AS TACITUS WELL CALLETH THEM TO HIM A HABIT OF DISSIMULATION IS A HINDERANCE AND A POORNESS
WHETHER IT BE THAT IT RAISETH THE PRICE OF THEIR HUSBAND'S KINDNESS WHEN IT COMES OR THAT THE WIVES TAKE A PRIDE IN THEIR PATIENCE BUT THIS NEVER FAILS IF THE BAD HUSBANDS WERE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING AGAINST THEIR FRIENDS CONSENT
FOR HIS THOUGHTS WILL FLY TO IT OF THEMSELVES SO AS THE SPACES OF OTHER BUSINESS OR STUDIES WILL SUFFICE A MAN'S NATURE RUNS EITHER TO HERBS OR WEEDS THEREFORE
LET NOT A MAN FORCE A HABIT UPON HIMSELF WITH A PERPETUAL CONTINUANCE BUT WITH SOME INTERMISSION FOR BOTH THE PAUSE REINFORCETH THE NEW ONSET AND IF A MAN THAT IS NOT PERFECT BE EVER IN PRACTICE
OF THEIR GOOD FAITH AND CLEARNESS OF DEALING MADE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE THERE BE THREE DEGREES OF THIS HIDING AND VEILING OF A MAN'S SELF THE FIRST CLOSENESS RESERVATION AND SECRECY
NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
THEY WILL GATHER AS MUCH BY HIS SILENCE AS BY HIS SPEECH AS FOR EQUIVOCATIONS OR ORACULOUS SPEECHES THEY CANNOT HOLD OUT LONG SO THAT NO MAN CAN BE SECRET EXCEPT HE GIVE HIMSELF A LITTLE SCOPE OF DISSIMULATION WHICH IS
BUT SO THEY BE OF THE LUMP THEY CARE NOT THOUGH THEY PASS NOT THROUGH THEIR OWN BODY AND TO SAY TRUTH IN NATURE IT IS MUCH A LIKE MATTER INSOMUCH THAT WE SEE A NEPHEW SOMETIMES RESEMBLETH AN UNCLE OR A KINSMAN
AND MAKES THEM SURFEIT MORE WHEN THEY COME TO PLENTY AND THEREFORE THE PROOF IS BEST WHEN MEN KEEP THEIR AUTHORITY TOWARDS THE CHILDREN BUT NOT THEIR PURSE MEN HAVE A FOOLISH MANNER BOTH PARENTS AND SCHOOLMASTERS AND SERVANTS
OF CUSTOM AND EDUCATION MEN'S THOUGHTS ARE MUCH ACCORDING TO THEIR INCLINATION THEIR DISCOURSE AND SPEECHES ACCORDING TO THEIR LEARNING AND INFUSED OPINIONS BUT THEIR DEEDS
GRAVE NATURES LED BY CUSTOM AND THEREFORE CONSTANT ARE COMMONLY LOVING HUSBANDS AS WAS SAID OF ULYSSES VETULAM SUAM PRAETULIT IMMORTALITATI CHASTE WOMEN
TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST VITELLIUS HE SAITH WE RISE NOT AGAINST THE PIERCING JUDGMENT OF AUGUSTUS NOR THE EXTREME CAUTION OR CLOSENESS OF TIBERIUS THESE PROPERTIES OF ARTS OR POLICY
AND ANOTHER EXCEPT TO IT YEA BUT HE HATH A GREAT CHARGE OF CHILDREN AS IF IT WERE AN ABATEMENT TO HIS RICHES BUT THE MOST ORDINARY CAUSE OF A SINGLE LIFE IS LIBERTY
FOR NATURE WILL LAY BURIED A GREAT TIME AND YET REVIVE UPON THE OCCASION OR TEMPTATION LIKE AS IT WAS WITH A ESOP'S DAMSEL TURNED FROM A CAT TO A WOMAN WHO SAT VERY DEMURELY AT THE BOARD'S END TILL A MOUSE RAN BEFORE HER
WE SEE IN NEEDLE WORKS AND EMBROIDERIES IT IS MORE PLEASING TO HAVE A LIVELY WORK UPON A SAD AND SOLEMN GROUND THAN TO HAVE A DARK AND MELANCHOLY WORK UPON A LIGHTSOME GROUND JUDGE THEREFORE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE HEART
HE SHALL AS WELL PRACTISE HIS ERRORS AS HIS ABILITIES AND INDUCE ONE HABIT OF BOTH AND THERE IS NO MEANS TO HELP THIS BUT BY SEASONABLE INTERMISSIONS BUT LET NOT A MAN TRUST HIS VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE TOO FAR
WHICH PRICK AND SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN DO NO OTHER THE MOST TOLERABLE SORT OF REVENGE
THEREFORE IT IS THE WEAKER SORT OF POLITICS THAT ARE THE GREAT DISSEMBLERS TACITUS SAITH LIVIA SORTED WELL WITH THE ARTS OF HER HUSBAND AND DISSIMULATION OF HER SON ATTRIBUTING ARTS OR POLICY TO AUGUSTUS
OR IN THE DEVICES OF THEIR ENTRANCE OR IN THE BRAVERY OF THEIR LIVERIES OR IN THE GOODLY FURNITURE OF THEIR HORSES AND ARMOR BUT ENOUGH OF THESE TOYS
HE MUST GO THROUGH OR TAKE A FALL THE THIRD IS THE BETTER TO DISCOVER THE MIND OF ANOTHER FOR TO HIM THAT OPENS HIMSELF MEN WILL HARDLY SHOW THEMSELVES ADVERSE BUT WILL FAIR LET HIM GO ON AND TURN THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
ARE AFTER AS THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND THEREFORE AS MACHIAVEL WELL NOTETH THOUGH IN AN EVIL FAVORED INSTANCE THERE IS NO TRUSTING TO THE FORCE OF NATURE NOR TO THE BRAVERY OF WORDS EXCEPT IT BE CORROBORATE BY CUSTOM
THAT HE MIGHT BE HANGED IN A WITHE AND NOT IN AN HALTER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO USED WITH FORMER REBELS THERE BE MONKS IN RUSSIA FOR PENANCE THAT WILL SIT A WHOLE NIGHT IN A VESSEL OF WATER
THE SPANISH NAME DESEMBOLTURA PARTLY EXPRESSETH THEM WHEN THERE BE NOT STONDS NOR RESTIVENESS IN A MAN'S NATURE BUT THAT THE WHEELS OF HIS MIND KEEP WAY WITH THE WHEELS OF HIS FORTUNE
WHICH CARRIETH THE GREATER BENEDICTION AND THE CLEARER REVELATION OF GOD'S FAVOR YET EVEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IF YOU LISTEN TO DAVID'S HARP YOU SHALL HEAR AS MANY HEARSE LIKE AIRS AS CAROLS AND THE PENCIL OF THE HOLY GHOST
BUT AFTER A TIME LET HIM PRACTISE WITH DISADVANTAGES AS DANCERS DO WITH THICK SHOES FOR IT BREEDS GREAT PERFECTION IF THE PRACTICE BE HARDER THAN THE USE WHERE NATURE IS MIGHTY AND THEREFORE THE VICTORY HARD
IN OTHER THINGS THE PREDOMINANCY OF CUSTOM IS EVERYWHERE VISIBLE INSOMUCH AS A MAN WOULD WONDER TO HEAR MEN PROFESS PROTEST ENGAGE GIVE GREAT WORDS AND THEN DO JUST AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE
THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY IS TEMPERANCE THE VIRTUE OF ADVERSITY IS FORTITUDE WHICH IN MORALS IS THE MORE HEROICAL VIRTUE PROSPERITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ADVERSITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE NEW
WERE WONT TO BE SCOURGED UPON THE ALTAR OF DIANA WITHOUT SO MUCH AS QUECHING I REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S TIME OF ENGLAND AN IRISH REBEL CONDEMNED PUT UP A PETITION TO THE DEPUTY
THEREFORE LET A MAN EITHER AVOID THE OCCASION ALTOGETHER OR PUT HIMSELF OFTEN TO IT THAT HE MAY BE LITTLE MOVED WITH IT A MAN'S NATURE IS BEST PERCEIVED IN PRIVATENESS FOR THERE IS NO AFFECTATION
WHICH SEEMETH NOT TO BE WITHOUT MYSTERY NAY AND TO HAVE SOME APPROACH TO THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN THAT HERCULES WHEN HE WENT TO UNBIND PROMETHEUS BY WHOM HUMAN NATURE IS REPRESENTED
NEVER PROSPERED IN ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK AFTERWARDS CERTAINLY THERE BE WHOSE FORTUNES ARE LIKE HOMER'S VERSES THAT HAVE A SLIDE AND EASINESS MORE THAN THE VERSES OF OTHER POETS
COMEDERIT NON FIT DRACO OVERT AND APPARENT VIRTUES BRING FORTH PRAISE BUT THERE BE SECRET AND HIDDEN VIRTUES THAT BRING FORTH FORTUNE CERTAIN DELIVERIES OF A MAN'S SELF WHICH HAVE NO NAME
AS IT WERE BUT THE SKIRTS OR TRAIN OF SECRECY BUT FOR THE THIRD DEGREE WHICH IS SIMULATION AND FALSE PROFESSION THAT I HOLD MORE CULPABLE AND LESS POLITIC EXCEPT IT BE IN GREAT AND RARE MATTERS AND THEREFORE
ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN SELF PLEASING AND HUMOROUS MINDS WHICH ARE SO SENSIBLE OF EVERY RESTRAINT AS THEY WILL GO NEAR TO THINK THEIR GIRDLES AND GARTERS TO BE BONDS AND SHACKLES UNMARRIED MEN ARE BEST FRIENDS
FOR THEY FEED AND RELIEVE THE EYE BEFORE IT BE FULL OF THE SAME OBJECT LET THE SCENES ABOUND WITH LIGHT SPECIALLY COLORED AND VARIED AND LET THE MASQUERS OR ANY OTHER
FOR CHARITY WILL HARDLY WATER THE GROUND WHERE IT MUST FIRST FILL A POOL IT IS INDIFFERENT FOR JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES FOR IF THEY BE FACILE AND CORRUPT YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT FIVE TIMES WORSE THAN A WIFE
BY THE PLEASURE OF THE EYE CERTAINLY VIRTUE IS LIKE PRECIOUS ODORS MOST FRAGRANT WHEN THEY ARE INCENSED OR CRUSHED FOR PROSPERITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VICE BUT ADVERSITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VIRTUE
AS PLUTARCH SAITH OF TIMOLEON'S FORTUNE IN RESPECT OF THAT OF
THIS WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN POESY WHERE TRANSCENDENCES ARE MORE ALLOWED AND THE POETS INDEED HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH IT FOR IT IS IN EFFECT THE THING WHICH FIGURED IN THAT STRANGE FICTION OF THE ANCIENT POETS
THAT SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION COMMONLY CARRY WITH THEM A SHOW OF FEARFULNESS WHICH IN ANY BUSINESS DOTH SPOIL THE FEATHERS OF ROUND FLYING UP TO THE MARK THE SECOND THAT IT PUZZLETH AND PERPLEXETH THE CONCEITS OF MANY
OF ADVERSITY IT WAS AN HIGH SPEECH OF SENECA AFTER THE MANNER OF THE STOICS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WHICH BELONG TO PROSPERITY ARE TO BE WISHED BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT BELONG TO ADVERSITY ARE TO BE ADMIRED
TAKE GOOD AT GOD'S HANDS AND NOT BE CONTENT TO TAKE EVIL ALSO AND SO OF FRIENDS IN A PROPORTION THIS IS CERTAIN THAT A MAN THAT STUDIETH REVENGE KEEPS HIS OWN WOUNDS GREEN
MAKETH NATURE LESS IMPORTUNE BUT CUSTOM ONLY DOTH ALTER AND SUBDUE NATURE HE THAT SEEKETH VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE LET HIM NOT SET HIMSELF TOO GREAT NOR TOO SMALL TASKS
OF FORTUNE IT CANNOT BE DENIED BUT OUTWARD ACCIDENTS CONDUCE MUCH TO FORTUNE FAVOR OPPORTUNITY DEATH OF OTHERS OCCASION FITTING VIRTUE BUT CHIEFLY THE MOULD OF A MAN'S FORTUNE IS IN HIS OWN HANDS
THE TONGUE IS MORE PLIANT TO ALL EXPRESSIONS AND SOUNDS THE JOINTS ARE MORE SUPPLE TO ALL FEATS OF ACTIVITY AND MOTIONS IN YOUTH THAN AFTERWARDS FOR IT IS TRUE THAT LATE LEARNERS CANNOT SO WELL TAKE THE PLY
WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HEAL AND DO WELL PUBLIC REVENGES ARE FOR THE MOST PART FORTUNATE AS THAT FOR THE DEATH OF CAESAR FOR THE DEATH OF PERTINAX FOR THE DEATH OF HENRY THE THIRD OF FRANCE AND MANY MORE
HAVE SOME MOTIONS UPON THE SCENE ITSELF BEFORE THEIR COMING DOWN FOR IT DRAWS THE EYE STRANGELY AND MAKES IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO DESIRE TO SEE THAT IT CANNOT PERFECTLY DISCERN
FOR SO LIVY AFTER HE HAD DESCRIBED CATO MAJOR IN THESE WORDS
IT MAKETH HIM PRACTISE SIMULATION IN OTHER THINGS LEST HIS HAND SHOULD BE OUT OF USE THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION ARE THREE FIRST TO LAY ASLEEP OPPOSITION AND TO SURPRISE
AND THEREFORE IT IS A GOOD SHREWD PROVERB OF THE SPANIARD TELL A LIE AND FIND A TROTH AS IF THERE WERE NO WAY OF DISCOVERY BUT BY SIMULATION THERE BE ALSO THREE DISADVANTAGES TO SET IT EVEN THE FIRST
BUT OF THEIR WORK AND SO BOTH CHILDREN AND CREATURES THE DIFFERENCE IN AFFECTION OF PARENTS TOWARDS THEIR SEVERAL CHILDREN IS MANY TIMES UNEQUAL AND SOMETIMES UNWORTHY ESPECIALLY IN THE MOTHERS AS SOLOMON SAITH
WHO MANY TIMES NEVERTHELESS PROVE THE BEST THE ILLIBERALITY OF PARENTS IN ALLOWANCE TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN IS AN HARMFUL ERROR MAKES THEM BASE ACQUAINTS THEM WITH SHIFTS MAKES THEM SORT WITH MEAN COMPANY
LET HIM SEASONABLY WATER THE ONE AND DESTROY THE OTHER
COSMUS DUKE OF FLORENCE HAD A DESPERATE SAYING AGAINST PERFIDIOUS OR NEGLECTING FRIENDS AS IF THOSE WRONGS WERE UNPARDONABLE YOU SHALL READ SAITH HE THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR ENEMIES
FOR WHERE A MAN'S INTENTIONS ARE PUBLISHED IT IS AN ALARUM TO CALL UP ALL THAT ARE AGAINST THEM THE SECOND IS TO RESERVE TO A MAN'S SELF A FAIR RETREAT FOR IF A MAN ENGAGE HIMSELF BY A MANIFEST DECLARATION
PLACED ALOFT AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SOME BROKEN MUSIC AND THE DITTY FITTED TO THE DEVICE ACTING IN SONG ESPECIALLY IN DIALOGUES HATH AN EXTREME GOOD GRACE I SAY ACTING NOT DANCING
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM IS IN HIS EXALTATION CERTAINLY THE GREAT MULTIPLICATION OF VIRTUES UPON HUMAN NATURE RESTETH UPON SOCIETIES WELL ORDAINED AND DISCIPLINED
ELSE A MAN'S ENEMY IS STILL BEFORE HAND AND IT IS TWO FOR ONE SOME WHEN THEY TAKE REVENGE ARE DESIROUS THE PARTY SHOULD KNOW WHENCE IT COMETH THIS IS THE MORE GENEROUS FOR THE DELIGHT SEEMETH TO BE
IT FOLLOWETH MANY TIMES UPON SECRECY BY A NECESSITY SO THAT HE THAT WILL BE SECRET MUST BE A DISSEMBLER IN SOME DEGREE FOR MEN ARE TOO CUNNING TO SUFFER A MAN TO KEEP AN INDIFFERENT CARRIAGE BETWEEN BOTH
TILL THEY BE ENGAGED WITH HARD ICE MANY EXAMPLES MAY BE PUT OF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM BOTH UPON MIND AND BODY THEREFORE SINCE CUSTOM IS THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATE OF MAN'S LIFE
IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE AFFECTION OR APTNESS OF THE CHILDREN BE EXTRAORDINARY THEN IT IS GOOD NOT TO CROSS IT BUT GENERALLY THE PRECEPT IS GOOD OPTIMUM
AND IT BE BUT FOR HER DAUGHTERS CONFIDENCE AND REPUTATION FOR THOSE TWO FELICITY BREEDETH THE FIRST WITHIN A MAN'S SELF THE LATTER IN OTHERS TOWARDS HIM ALL WISE MEN TO DECLINE THE ENVY OF THEIR OWN VIRTUES
FALLETH UPON THAT THAT HE HAD VERSATILE INGENIUM THEREFORE IF A MAN LOOK SHARPLY AND ATTENTIVELY HE SHALL SEE FORTUNE FOR THOUGH SHE BE BLIND YET SHE IS NOT INVISIBLE
SO ARE THERE A NUMBER OF LITTLE AND SCARCE DISCERNED VIRTUES OR RATHER FACULTIES AND CUSTOMS THAT MAKE MEN FORTUNATE THE ITALIANS NOTE SOME OF THEM SUCH AS A MAN WOULD LITTLE THINK WHEN THEY SPEAK OF ONE THAT CANNOT DO AMISS
FOR JUSTS AND TOURNEYS AND BARRIERS THE GLORIES OF THEM ARE CHIEFLY IN THE CHARIOTS WHEREIN THE CHALLENGERS MAKE THEIR ENTRY ESPECIALLY IF THEY BE DRAWN WITH STRANGE BEASTS AS LIONS BEARS CAMELS AND THE LIKE
EXCEPT IT BE IN SOME MINDS THAT HAVE NOT SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO FIX BUT HAVE KEPT THEMSELVES OPEN AND PREPARED TO RECEIVE CONTINUAL AMENDMENT WHICH IS EXCEEDING RARE BUT IF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM SIMPLE AND SEPARATE BE GREAT
AS IF THEY WERE DEAD IMAGES AND ENGINES MOVED ONLY BY THE WHEELS OF CUSTOM WE SEE ALSO THE REIGN OR TYRANNY OF CUSTOM WHAT IT IS THE INDIANS I MEAN THE SECT OF THEIR WISE MEN
BUT WHEN ANDREA URGED HIS SUIT SHE BETRAYED AN ENTIRE DISLIKE TO HIM THE BARON MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE PERCEIVED IT BUT ATTRIBUTING IT TO A CAPRICE FEIGNED IGNORANCE THE DELAY DEMANDED BY BEAUCHAMP HAD NEARLY EXPIRED
AND THEN LARGELY KING MELIODAS AND HIS QUEEN DEPARTED OF THEIR LANDS AND GOODS TO SIR TRISTRAM THEN BY THE LICENSE OF KING MELIODAS HIS FATHER HE RETURNED AGAIN UNTO THE COURT OF KING MARK AND THERE HE LIVED IN GREAT JOY LONG TIME
I SHOULD GLADLY MAKE AN APOLOGY BUT ALAS BUT WHAT THE PARAGRAPH WAS CORRECT MY FRIEND WHAT THAT FRENCH OFFICER YES FERNAND YES
THE COUNT TOLD EVERY ONE THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAD HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE AT AUTEUIL
TO ME ALL THE TRUTH ANON FOR DREAD SHE SAID HERE WAS SIR TRISTRAM WITH ME AND BY THE WAY AS HE CAME TO ME WARD HE WAS SORE WOUNDED
ARE YOU GOING TO MARRY MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS WHY DO YOU ASK ME NOW BECAUSE THE RUPTURE OR FULFILMENT OF THIS ENGAGEMENT IS CONNECTED WITH THE PERSON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING
I WISHED TO SEE ALL AND TO JUDGE OF EVERYTHING FOR MYSELF
IT MEANS THAT I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM YANINA FROM YANINA YES IMPOSSIBLE HERE IS MY PASSPORT EXAMINE THE VISA
AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS RECEIVED AT THE BANKER'S AS THE BETROTHED
SEEMS TO ME TO PROCEED FROM ONE FAR LESS PURE PROVIDENCE APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE NO SHARE IN THIS AFFAIR AND HAPPILY SO FOR INSTEAD OF THE INVISIBLE IMPALPABLE AGENT OF CELESTIAL REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS I SHALL FIND ONE BOTH PALPABLE AND VISIBLE
NAY SAID SIR TRISTRAM FOR I MUST HAVE ADO WITH ONE OF YOUR FELLOWS HIS NAME IS SIR BLEOBERIS DE GANIS GOD SPEED YOU WELL SAID SIR SAGRAMORE AND DODINAS SIR TRISTRAM DEPARTED AND RODE ONWARD ON HIS WAY
BEING CALLED ON TO PROVE THE CRIME WAS PREPARING HIS BRIEF WITH THE SAME ARDOR THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO EXERCISE WHEN REQUIRED TO SPEAK IN CRIMINAL CASES BUT THREE WEEKS HAD ALREADY PASSED AND THE MOST DILIGENT SEARCH HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL
I SHALL RESIGN THE CASE TO THE KING'S ATTORNEY YOU MISTAKE SIR SAID MORCERF WITH A GLOOMY SMILE I AM NOT REFERRING IN THE LEAST TO MATRIMONY

I IMAGINE ANY ONE MAY WRITE TO YANINA BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WROTE ONE ONLY YES AND THAT WAS YOU I DOUBTLESS WROTE
AND KNOWING EVERYTHING HE HAD ADVISED DANGLARS TO WRITE TO YANINA THE ANSWER KNOWN HE HAD YIELDED TO ALBERT'S WISH TO BE INTRODUCED TO HAIDEE AND ALLOWED THE CONVERSATION TO TURN ON THE DEATH OF ALI AND HAD NOT OPPOSED HAIDEE'S RECITAL
DID A LOVELY SUMMER'S DAY EVER DAWN WITH GREATER PURITY THAN HAS MARKED THE COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR CAREER NO ALBERT TAKE MY ADVICE YOU ARE YOUNG AND RICH LEAVE PARIS ALL IS SOON FORGOTTEN IN THIS GREAT BABYLON OF EXCITEMENT AND CHANGING TASTES
THE DARING ATTEMPT TO ROB THE COUNT WAS THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT PARIS FOR THE NEXT FORTNIGHT THE DYING MAN HAD SIGNED A DEPOSITION DECLARING BENEDETTO TO BE THE ASSASSIN THE POLICE HAD ORDERS TO MAKE THE STRICTEST SEARCH FOR THE MURDERER
EXCUSE ME ALBERT SORROW ON YOUR ACCOUNT AND DELIGHT WITH THAT NOBLE GIRL THUS PURSUING PATERNAL VENGEANCE YES ALBERT FROM WHATEVER SOURCE THE BLOW MAY HAVE PROCEEDED IT MAY BE FROM AN ENEMY BUT THAT ENEMY IS ONLY THE AGENT OF PROVIDENCE
AND THEN HE TOLD HER ALL WHAT HE WAS AND HOW HE HAD CHANGED HIS NAME BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT BE KNOWN AND HOW A LADY TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE WHOLE TILL HE CAME INTO THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE POISON WAS MADE WHERETHROUGH I WAS NEAR MY DEATH HAD NOT YOUR LADYSHIP BEEN
I SHOULD HAVE FLED FROM MY COUNTRY DEAR ALBERT SAID BEAUCHAMP BUT THIS SUDDEN AND FACTITIOUS JOY SOON FORSOOK THE YOUNG MAN AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY A STILL GREATER GRIEF WELL SAID BEAUCHAMP WHAT STILL OPPRESSES YOU MY FRIEND

I WAS SPEAKING OF YOUR FATHER'S PAST HISTORY I SAID THE ORIGIN OF HIS FORTUNE REMAINED OBSCURE THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MY SCRUPLES ASKED ME WHERE YOUR FATHER HAD ACQUIRED HIS PROPERTY I ANSWERED IN GREECE
FOR IT MAY HAPPEN A CORNISH KNIGHT MAY MATCH YOU
AND THE LIFE OF SUCH A MAN AS LIEUTENANT GENERAL THE COUNT OF MORCERF PEER OF FRANCE WHAT MUST THEN BE DONE WHAT I HAVE DONE ALBERT I REASONED THUS

HAVE YE NO DOUBT BUT I WILL HAVE ADO WITH THEM TO INCREASE MY WORSHIP
ALBERT OPENED THE PAPER IT WAS AN ATTESTATION OF FOUR NOTABLE INHABITANTS OF YANINA PROVING THAT COLONEL FERNAND MONDEGO IN THE SERVICE OF ALI TEPELINI HAD SURRENDERED THE CASTLE FOR TWO MILLION CROWNS THE SIGNATURES WERE PERFECTLY LEGAL
CONTEMPT MY FRIEND HOW DOES THIS MISFORTUNE AFFECT YOU NO HAPPILY THAT UNJUST PREJUDICE IS FORGOTTEN WHICH MADE THE SON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FATHER'S ACTIONS REVIEW YOUR LIFE ALBERT ALTHOUGH IT IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING

THEN RECOLLECTING THE HONOR YOU HAD DONE ME IN ADMITTING ME TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP I HASTENED TO YOU ALBERT STILL EXTENDED ON THE CHAIR COVERED HIS FACE WITH BOTH HANDS AS IF TO PREVENT THE LIGHT FROM REACHING HIM
I WILL FACILITATE IT BY REPEATING THE QUESTION WILL YOU OR WILL YOU NOT RETRACT MORCERF IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ANSWER YES OR NO TO QUESTIONS WHICH CONCERN THE HONOR THE SOCIAL INTEREST
AH NOBLE FELLOW CRIED HE TAKE THESE SAID BEAUCHAMP PRESENTING THE PAPERS TO ALBERT ALBERT SEIZED THEM WITH A CONVULSIVE HAND TORE THEM IN PIECES AND TREMBLING LEST THE LEAST VESTIGE SHOULD ESCAPE AND ONE DAY APPEAR TO CONFRONT HIM
WHEN SIR SEGWARIDES HEARD TELL THAT HIS LADY WAS GONE WITH A KNIGHT OF KING ARTHUR'S COURT THEN HE ARMED HIM AND RODE AFTER THAT KNIGHT FOR TO RESCUE HIS LADY SO WHEN BLEOBERIS WAS GONE WITH THIS LADY KING MARK AND ALL THE COURT WAS WROTH THAT SHE WAS AWAY
SO GOD ME HELP SAID THE KING I MAY NOT SAY BUT YE DID AS A KNIGHT SHOULD
ON WHOM I SHALL REVENGE MYSELF I ASSURE YOU FOR ALL I HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE LAST MONTH NOW I REPEAT BEAUCHAMP I WISH TO RETURN TO HUMAN AND MATERIAL EXISTENCE AND IF YOU ARE STILL THE FRIEND YOU PROFESS TO BE

WHY HAST THOU BETRAYED ME AND THEREWITHAL HE SWANG OUT A SWORD AND SAID BUT IF THOU TELL ME WHO HATH BEEN HERE HERE THOU SHALT DIE AH MY LORD MERCY SAID THE LADY AND HELD UP HER HANDS SAYING SLAY ME NOT AND I SHALL TELL YOU ALL WHO HATH BEEN HERE
HOW AND WHY BECAUSE A FORTNIGHT SINCE I WAS QUESTIONED ON THE SAME SUBJECT
AND YOU SHALL ATTEND TO YOUR AFFAIRS AND I TO MINE WILLINGLY SAID ALBERT BUT LET US WALK I THINK A LITTLE EXERTION WOULD DO ME GOOD THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED OUT ON THE FORTRESS
YOU WILL RETURN AFTER THREE OR FOUR YEARS WITH A RUSSIAN PRINCESS FOR A BRIDE AND NO ONE WILL THINK MORE OF WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY THAN IF IT HAD HAPPENED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO THANK YOU MY DEAR BEAUCHAMP THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT FEELING WHICH PROMPTS YOUR ADVICE BUT IT CANNOT BE
ALBERT HELD HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS HE RAISED HIS FACE RED WITH SHAME AND BATHED IN TEARS AND SEIZING BEAUCHAMP'S ARM MY FRIEND SAID HE MY LIFE IS ENDED I CANNOT CALMLY SAY WITH YOU PROVIDENCE HAS STRUCK THE BLOW
YOU APPEAR TO ACCUSE THE COUNT WHO IS ABSENT FROM PARIS AT THIS MOMENT AND CANNOT JUSTIFY HIMSELF I ACCUSE NO ONE SIR SAID DANGLARS I RELATE AND I WILL REPEAT BEFORE THE COUNT WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU DOES THE COUNT KNOW WHAT ANSWER YOU RECEIVED
AND SHALL ALWAYS REMIND ME THAT I OWE MY LIFE AND THE HONOR OF MY NAME TO YOU FOR HAD THIS BEEN KNOWN OH BEAUCHAMP I SHOULD HAVE DESTROYED MYSELF
IF MY FATHER HAD OFFENDED HIM WHY DID HE NOT ATTACK HIM PERSONALLY OH NO HE WAS AFRAID TO ENCOUNTER HIM FACE TO FACE I DO NOT CONDEMN YOU ALBERT I ONLY RESTRAIN YOU ACT PRUDENTLY OH DO NOT FEAR
BY FOLLOWING IT WE MAY PERHAPS DISCOVER SOMETHING MORE CERTAIN TELL ME SATISFY MY IMPATIENCE WELL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I DID NOT LIKE TO MENTION ON MY RETURN FROM YANINA SAY ON
AND GREAT WORDS HE SPAKE AND ANON WITH LITTLE MIGHT HE WAS LAID TO THE EARTH
THAT SHALL NOT BE FOR EITHER THOU SHALT DIE OR I THEN SIR TRISTRAM DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND HURTLED HIS HORSE UNTO HIM FIERCELY
AND WITHIN A WHILE HE OVERTOOK SIR TRISTRAM AND THEN HE BADE HIM TURN FALSE TRAITOR KNIGHT AND SIR TRISTRAM ANON TURNED HIM AGAINST HIM AND THEREWITHAL SEGWARIDES SMOTE SIR TRISTRAM WITH A SPEAR THAT IT ALL TO BRAST
THESE ATTESTATIONS WHICH I ALONE POSSESS TO BE DESTROYED DO YOU WISH THIS FRIGHTFUL SECRET TO REMAIN WITH US CONFIDED TO ME IT SHALL NEVER ESCAPE MY LIPS SAY ALBERT MY FRIEND DO YOU WISH IT ALBERT THREW HIMSELF ON BEAUCHAMP'S NECK
WHO HIGHLY APPROVED OF THE UNION REGRETTED HIS INABILITY TO LEAVE PARMA AT THAT TIME AND PROMISED A WEDDING GIFT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES IT WAS AGREED THAT THE THREE MILLIONS SHOULD BE INTRUSTED TO DANGLARS TO INVEST
CHAPTER EIGHTY SEVEN THE CHALLENGE THEN CONTINUED BEAUCHAMP I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SILENCE AND THE DARKNESS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN
AND SO WENT HIS WAY WITH HER AND SO HE TOOK HIS HORSE AND GART SET HER BEHIND HIS SQUIRE AND RODE UPON HIS WAY
AND THERE SIR TRISTRAM SMOTE SIR SAGRAMORE A STRONG BUFFET THAT HE BARE HIS HORSE AND HIM TO THE EARTH AND IN THE FALLING HE BRAKE HIS THIGH WHEN THIS WAS DONE SIR TRISTRAM ASKED THEM FAIR KNIGHTS WILL YE ANY MORE BE THERE NO BIGGER KNIGHTS IN THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR
THOSE WHO ASK NO QUESTIONS ARE THE BEST COMFORTERS
I MEAN SAID ALBERT DRAWING NEAR AND WITHOUT APPARENTLY NOTICING CAVALCANTI WHO STOOD WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE I MEAN TO PROPOSE A MEETING IN SOME RETIRED CORNER WHERE NO ONE WILL INTERRUPT US FOR TEN MINUTES THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT
HE THE MAN WHO WOULD BE POPULAR CANNOT FORGIVE THE COUNT OF MORCERF FOR BEING CREATED A PEER AND THIS MARRIAGE BROKEN OFF WITHOUT A REASON BEING ASSIGNED YES IT IS ALL FROM THE SAME CAUSE
ALBERT'S ATTACK ON ANDREA HAD PLACED HIM ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
MORCERF APPRECIATED THE ADVICE OF MONTE CRISTO TO LET THINGS DIE AWAY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD NO ONE HAD TAKEN UP THE REMARK ABOUT THE GENERAL AND NO ONE HAD RECOGNIZED IN THE OFFICER WHO BETRAYED THE CASTLE OF YANINA THE NOBLE COUNT IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS
AND WHEN KING MARK WAS WHOLE IN HIS PROSPERITY THERE CAME TIDINGS THAT SIR TRISTRAM WAS ARRIVED AND WHOLE OF HIS WOUNDS THEREOF WAS KING MARK PASSING GLAD AND SO WERE ALL THE BARONS AND WHEN HE SAW HIS TIME HE RODE UNTO HIS FATHER KING MELIODAS
I HASTENED TO YOU CONTINUED BEAUCHAMP TO TELL YOU ALBERT THAT IN THIS CHANGING AGE THE FAULTS OF A FATHER CANNOT REVERT UPON HIS CHILDREN FEW HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WE WERE BORN
WHEN THE DAY AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THIS ANSWER YOUR FATHER CAME BY THE ADVICE OF MONTE CRISTO TO ASK MY DAUGHTER'S HAND FOR YOU I DECIDEDLY REFUSED HIM BUT WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION OR EXPOSURE IN SHORT WHY SHOULD I HAVE ANY MORE TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR
TWO KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR'S COURT THAT RODE BY THE COUNTRY TO SEEK THEIR ADVENTURES WHEN SIR TRISTRAM SAW SIR ANDRED HE ASKED HIM WHAT TIDINGS
FOR IN THE PARTS OF ENGLAND IT MAY HAPPEN I MAY DO YOU SERVICE AT SOME SEASON
SIR SAID TRISTRAM NOW I SHALL TELL YOU ALL THE TRUTH MY FATHER'S NAME IS SIR MELIODAS KING OF LIONES
ALBERT TOTTERED AND FELL OVERPOWERED IN A CHAIR IT COULD NO LONGER BE DOUBTED THE FAMILY NAME WAS FULLY GIVEN AFTER A MOMENT'S MOURNFUL SILENCE HIS HEART OVERFLOWED AND HE GAVE WAY TO A FLOOD OF TEARS
HE APPROACHED THE WAX LIGHT ALWAYS KEPT BURNING FOR CIGARS AND BURNED EVERY FRAGMENT DEAR EXCELLENT FRIEND MURMURED ALBERT STILL BURNING THE PAPERS LET ALL BE FORGOTTEN AS A SORROWFUL DREAM SAID BEAUCHAMP
BUT I REQUIRE THEE SAID SIR SAGRAMORE TELL US YOUR RIGHT NAME BY THE FAITH AND TROTH THAT YE OWE TO THE HIGH ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD YE CHARGE ME WITH A GREAT THING SAID SIR TRISTRAM
AND I SHALL NEVER FAIL HER TO DO AS MUCH AS A KNIGHT MAY DO ALSO I BESEECH YOUR GOOD GRACE THAT I MAY TAKE MY LEAVE AT MY LADY YOUR DAUGHTER AND AT ALL THE BARONS AND KNIGHTS I WILL WELL SAID THE KING
NOW IF YOU ARE MAD AND TRY TO BITE ME I WILL KILL YOU WITHOUT PITY IS IT MY FAULT THAT YOUR FATHER HAS DISHONORED HIMSELF YES MISERABLE WRETCH CRIED MORCERF IT IS YOUR FAULT
FOR THEY LOVED BOTH ONE LADY AND SHE WAS AN EARL'S WIFE THAT HIGHT SIR SEGWARIDES AND THIS LADY LOVED SIR TRISTRAM PASSINGLY WELL AND HE LOVED HER AGAIN FOR SHE WAS A PASSING FAIR LADY
NOT FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE BUT THROUGH FEAR BESIDES WHAT WAS MORCERF SEEKING IT WAS NOT WHETHER DANGLARS OR MONTE CRISTO WAS MORE OR LESS GUILTY IT WAS A MAN WHO WOULD ANSWER FOR THE OFFENCE WHETHER TRIFLING OR SERIOUS IT WAS A MAN WHO WOULD FIGHT
THEN WAS KING MARK HEAVY THEREOF AND ALL THE COURT WHEN SIR TRISTRAM HEARD OF THIS HE WAS ASHAMED AND SORE GRIEVED
AND HEARING THE ORDER GIVEN FORCED THE DOOR OPEN AND FOLLOWED BY BEAUCHAMP FOUND HIMSELF IN THE BANKER'S STUDY SIR CRIED THE LATTER AM I NO LONGER AT LIBERTY TO RECEIVE WHOM I CHOOSE IN MY HOUSE YOU APPEAR TO FORGET YOURSELF SADLY
BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE PARTICULARS WHICH ARE GIVEN PROVE THAT FERNAND MONDEGO RAISED BY ALI PASHA TO THE RANK OF GOVERNOR GENERAL IS NO OTHER THAN COUNT FERNAND OF MORCERF
HE CHERISHED THE THOUGHT OF THE DUEL HOPING TO CONCEAL ITS TRUE CAUSE EVEN FROM HIS SECONDS BEAUCHAMP HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE DAY HE VISITED ALBERT AND THOSE OF WHOM THE LATTER INQUIRED ALWAYS TOLD HIM HE WAS OUT ON A JOURNEY WHICH WOULD DETAIN HIM SOME DAYS
BUT I MUST DISCOVER WHO PURSUES ME WITH THIS HATRED AND WHEN I HAVE FOUND HIM I SHALL KILL HIM OR HE WILL KILL ME I RELY ON YOUR FRIENDSHIP TO ASSIST ME BEAUCHAMP IF CONTEMPT HAS NOT BANISHED IT FROM YOUR HEART
AND THEREFORE HERE DO YOUR BEST AND WIT YE WELL BUT IF YE QUIT YOU THE BETTER HERE UPON THIS GROUND ONE KNIGHT OF CORNWALL SHALL BEAT YOU BOTH WHEN SIR DODINAS LE SAVAGE HEARD HIM SAY SO HE GAT A SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND SAID SIR KNIGHT KEEP WELL THYSELF
IT NEITHER INCREASED NOR DECREASED MY INCOME ALBERT FELT THE BLOOD MOUNTING TO HIS BROW THERE WAS NO DOUBT UPON THE SUBJECT DANGLARS DEFENDED HIMSELF WITH THE BASENESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A MAN WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH AT LEAST IN PART IF NOT WHOLLY
SITHEN I DID ANY DEEDS OF ARMS DO AS YE LIST SAID GOUVERNAIL AND THEREWITHAL ANON SIR TRISTRAM ASKED THEM FROM WHENCE THEY CAME
THE TRAITOR WHO SURRENDERED THE CASTLE OF THE MAN IN WHOSE SERVICE HE WAS PARDON ME MY FRIEND THAT MAN WAS YOUR FATHER ALBERT ADVANCED FURIOUSLY TOWARDS BEAUCHAMP BUT THE LATTER RESTRAINED HIM MORE BY A MILD LOOK THAN BY HIS EXTENDED HAND
NOT SO MURMURED THE JOURNALIST ON THE CONTRARY ALBERT TURNED FRIGHTFULLY PALE HE ENDEAVORED TO SPEAK BUT THE WORDS DIED ON HIS LIPS MY FRIEND SAID BEAUCHAMP IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE TONE
BECAUSE HE APPEARED DISPOSED TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US IN ONE RESPECT YOU ARE RIGHT FOR I AM READY TO QUARREL WITH EVERY ONE TO DAY
YOU HAVE A CLAIM BEING ALMOST ONE OF THE FAMILY AND I WILL GIVE AS MANY RENDEZVOUS OF THAT KIND AS I CAN FIND PERSONS WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM CAVALCANTI LOOKED AT DANGLARS WITH A STUPEFIED AIR AND THE LATTER MAKING AN EFFORT AROSE AND STEPPED BETWEEN THE TWO YOUNG MEN
I MUST AT LEAST KNOW WHY I DO SO I MUST MEET HIM WITH A HEART AT EASE AND THAT QUIET CONSCIENCE WHICH A MAN NEEDS WHEN HIS OWN ARM MUST SAVE HIS LIFE WELL SAID MORCERF IMPATIENTLY WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN
BEAUCHAMP WHO HAD WATCHED WITH SINCERE PITY THE YOUNG MAN'S PAROXYSM OF GRIEF APPROACHED HIM
CAVALCANTI WILL CERTAINLY FIGHT THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THE YOUNG MAN BUT THE BANKER RECOLLECTING WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED THE DAY BEFORE DID NOT WISH HIM ADMITTED IT WAS HOWEVER TOO LATE ALBERT HAD FOLLOWED THE FOOTMAN
MAKE INQUIRIES AND IF IT BE TRUE OH YES IF IT BE TRUE CRIED THE YOUNG MAN HE SHALL PAY ME ALL I HAVE SUFFERED BEWARE MORCERF HE IS ALREADY AN OLD MAN I WILL RESPECT HIS AGE AS HE HAS RESPECTED THE HONOR OF MY FAMILY
ALSO SHE CHARGED YOU THAT YE COME NOT TO HER BUT IF YE BE WELL ARMED FOR HER LOVER WAS CALLED A GOOD KNIGHT SIR TRISTRAM ANSWERED TO THE DWARF RECOMMEND ME UNTO MY LADY
AND MY MOTHER DIED OF ME IN THE FOREST AND BECAUSE THEREOF SHE COMMANDED OR SHE DIED THAT WHEN I WERE CHRISTENED THEY SHOULD CHRISTEN ME TRISTRAM AND BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE KNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY I TURNED MY NAME AND LET ME CALL TRAMTRIST
ALBERT HOWEVER FELT NO LESS INSULTED THE FEW LINES WHICH HAD IRRITATED HIM WERE CERTAINLY INTENDED AS AN INSULT BESIDES
SIR SHE SAID HE IS ARMED AND DEPARTED ON HORSEBACK NOT YET HENCE HALF A MILE
THEN KING MARK UNDERSTOOD THAT AND WAS JEALOUS FOR KING MARK LOVED HER PASSINGLY WELL SO IT FELL UPON A DAY THIS LADY SENT A DWARF UNTO SIR TRISTRAM AND BADE HIM AS HE LOVED HER THAT HE WOULD BE WITH HER THE NIGHT NEXT FOLLOWING
AND THAT ONE BEAT ME AND WOUNDED ME AND SET NOUGHT BY MY MESSAGE FAIR COUSIN SAID SIR TRISTRAM RIDE ON YOUR WAY AND IF I MAY MEET THEM IT MAY HAPPEN I SHALL REVENGE YOU SO SIR ANDRED RODE INTO CORNWALL AND SIR TRISTRAM RODE AFTER THE TWO KNIGHTS
THEN WITHIN A WHILE CAME ONE OF SIR SEGWARIDES SQUIRES AND TOLD IN THE COURT THAT SIR SEGWARIDES WAS BEATEN SORE AND WOUNDED TO THE POINT OF DEATH AS HE WOULD HAVE RESCUED HIS LADY SIR BLEOBERIS OVERTHREW HIM AND SORE HATH WOUNDED HIM
BESIDES YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME BEAUCHAMP SOLEMN TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE SANCTIONED BY A WITNESS
WHEN SIR SAGRAMORE SAW HIS FELLOW HAVE SUCH A FALL HE MARVELLED WHAT KNIGHT HE MIGHT BE AND HE DRESSED HIS SPEAR WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SIR TRISTRAM AGAINST HIM AND THEY CAME TOGETHER AS THE THUNDER
OR TO EXPRESS A SINGLE DOUBT TO THE BARON THE BARON ADORED COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI NOT SO MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE DANGLARS WITH AN INSTINCTIVE HATRED OF MATRIMONY SHE SUFFERED ANDREA'S ATTENTIONS IN ORDER TO GET RID OF MORCERF
KING MARK ARMED HIM AND MADE HIM READY AND TOOK TWO KNIGHTS OF HIS COUNSEL WITH HIM
AND SO SIR TRISTRAM DEPARTED AND LEFT HIM THERE
SIR REPLIED DANGLARS PALE WITH ANGER AND FEAR I WARN YOU WHEN I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO MEET WITH A MAD DOG I KILL IT AND FAR FROM THINKING MYSELF GUILTY OF A CRIME I BELIEVE I DO SOCIETY A KINDNESS
AND THEN THEY DEPARTED AND CAME TOGETHER AS IT HAD BEEN THUNDER AND SIR DODINAS SPEAR BRAST IN SUNDER BUT SIR TRISTRAM SMOTE HIM WITH A MORE MIGHT THAT HE SMOTE HIM CLEAN OVER THE HORSE CROUP THAT NIGH HE HAD BROKEN HIS NECK
I MUST ASCERTAIN IF YOUR INSINUATIONS ARE JUST AND AM GOING NOW TO INQUIRE OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
BUT YOU HYPOCRITICALLY PROVOKED IT I YES YOU HOW CAME IT KNOWN I SUPPOSE YOU READ IT IN THE PAPER IN THE ACCOUNT FROM YANINA WHO WROTE TO YANINA TO YANINA YES WHO WROTE FOR PARTICULARS CONCERNING MY FATHER
COME SAID BEAUCHAMP TAKING BOTH HIS HANDS TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND BUT HOW CAME THAT FIRST NOTE TO BE INSERTED IN YOUR JOURNAL SOME UNKNOWN ENEMY AN INVISIBLE FOE HAS DONE THIS
SIR SAID TRISTRAM I THANK YOU OF YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP THAT I HAVE HAD WITH YOU HERE AND THE GREAT GOODNESS MY LADY YOUR DAUGHTER HATH SHEWED ME AND THEREFORE SAID SIR TRISTRAM
SOME PERSONS HAD WARNED THE YOUNG MAN OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FUTURE FATHER IN LAW WHO HAD OF LATE SUSTAINED REPEATED LOSSES BUT WITH SUBLIME DISINTERESTEDNESS AND CONFIDENCE THE YOUNG MAN REFUSED TO LISTEN
AND HE MAY HOPE THAT HE WILL NOT BE BUT ON MY HONOR
AND WIT YE WELL SAID TRISTRAM UNTO THE KING I DID THE BATTLE FOR THE LOVE OF MINE UNCLE KING MARK AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE COUNTRY OF CORNWALL AND FOR TO INCREASE MINE HONOUR FOR THAT SAME DAY THAT I FOUGHT WITH SIR MARHAUS I WAS MADE KNIGHT AND NEVER OR THEN DID I BATTLE WITH NO KNIGHT
THE USHER WHO HAD INTRODUCED ME WAS WAITING FOR ME AT THE DOOR AND HE CONDUCTED ME THROUGH THE CORRIDORS TO A PRIVATE ENTRANCE OPENING INTO THE RUE DE VAUGIRARD I LEFT WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT
AND IT WAS EVIDENT DANGLARS WOULD NOT FIGHT AND IN ADDITION TO THIS EVERYTHING FORGOTTEN OR UNPERCEIVED BEFORE PRESENTED ITSELF NOW TO HIS RECOLLECTION MONTE CRISTO KNEW EVERYTHING AS HE HAD BOUGHT THE DAUGHTER OF ALI PASHA
AND GOUVERNAIL HIS SERVANT BARE HIS SHIELD AND SPEAR AND SO AS SIR TRISTRAM RODE FAST HE MET WITH SIR ANDRED HIS COUSIN THAT BY THE COMMANDMENT OF KING MARK WAS SENT TO BRING FORTH AN EVER IT LAY IN HIS POWER
AND IF IT HAD BEEN THAT HER LORD HAD NOT BEEN HERE IN THIS COURT THEN FOR THE WORSHIP OF THIS COURT PERADVENTURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN HER CHAMPION AND IF SO BE SIR SEGWARIDES SPEED NOT WELL IT MAY HAPPEN THAT I WILL SPEAK WITH THAT GOOD KNIGHT OR EVER HE PASS FROM THIS COUNTRY
THE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AND THE MURDER OF THE ROBBER BY HIS COMRADE WERE ALMOST FORGOTTEN IN ANTICIPATION OF THE APPROACHING MARRIAGE OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS TO THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THIS WEDDING WOULD SHORTLY TAKE PLACE
BUT SHE MEANT THAT EITHER OF THEM HAD LOVED OTHER WITH ENTIRE HEART BUT SIR TRISTRAM ANSWERED HER THUS FAIR LADY IT IS NOT MY PART TO HAVE ADO IN SUCH MATTERS WHILE HER LORD AND HUSBAND IS PRESENT HERE
I WENT OF COURSE TO THE CHIEF BANKER OF THE TOWN TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT THE FIRST WORD BEFORE I HAD EVEN MENTIONED YOUR FATHER'S NAME
IT IS NOT ONLY A RIGHT BUT A DUTY YOU WROTE SIR KNOWING WHAT ANSWER YOU WOULD RECEIVE I INDEED I ASSURE YOU CRIED DANGLARS WITH A CONFIDENCE AND SECURITY PROCEEDING LESS FROM FEAR THAN FROM THE INTEREST HE REALLY FELT FOR THE YOUNG MAN
BUT AS LONG AS KING MARK LIVED HE LOVED NEVER SIR TRISTRAM AFTER THAT
AND THUS IT PASSED MANY WEEKS AND DAYS AND ALL WAS FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN FOR SIR SEGWARIDES DURST NOT HAVE ADO WITH SIR TRISTRAM BECAUSE OF HIS NOBLE PROWESS
HE FOUND IT EVERYWHERE MET BY DARK QUICK AND ROLLING EYEBALLS GATHERING NO ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THIS STARTLING PRESAGE OF THE NATURE OF THE SCRUTINY HE WAS LIKELY TO UNDERGO FROM THE MORE MATURE JUDGMENTS OF THE MEN
AND WHAT SEEMED TO DUNCAN A FINAL EFFORT TO GAIN THE WOOD AS IF AWARE THAT NO DANGER WAS TO BE APPREHENDED FROM THE YOUNG SOLDIER THE FUGITIVE NEARLY BRUSHED HIS PERSON IN HIS FLIGHT A TALL AND POWERFUL HURON WHO HAD HUSBANDED HIS FORCES
HIS HEAD WAS IMMOVABLE NOR DID HE BETRAY THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ANY WERE PRESENT EXCEPT WHEN HIS HAUGHTY EYE ROLLED TOWARD THE DUSKY FORMS OF THE WARRIORS WHO STALKED IN THE BACKGROUND SILENT AND SULLEN OBSERVERS OF THE SCENE
BUT BOYS LITTLE ABLE TO WIELD THE INSTRUMENTS TORE THE TOMAHAWKS FROM THE BELTS OF THEIR FATHERS AND STOLE INTO THE RANKS APT IMITATORS OF THE SAVAGE TRAITS EXHIBITED BY THEIR PARENTS
THEY WHO COMPOSED THE OUTER CIRCLE OF FACES WERE ON TIPTOE TO GAZE AND EVEN THE CULPRIT FOR AN INSTANT FORGOT HIS SHAME IN A DEEPER EMOTION AND EXPOSED HIS ABJECT FEATURES IN ORDER TO CAST AN ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED GLANCE AT THE DARK ASSEMBLAGE OF CHIEFS
THE HIGH SPIRITED DUNCAN FELT A POWERFUL IMPULSE OF ADMIRATION AND PITY TOWARD THE FORMER
AND LED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE COUNCIL LODGE THITHER ALL THE CHIEFS AND MOST OF THE DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS FOLLOWED AMONG WHOM THE ANXIOUS HEYWARD FOUND MEANS TO ENTER WITHOUT ATTRACTING ANY DANGEROUS ATTENTION TO HIMSELF
APPROACHING UNCAS SHE HELD THE BLAZING BRAND IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CAST ITS RED GLARE ON HIS PERSON AND TO EXPOSE THE SLIGHTEST EMOTION OF HIS COUNTENANCE THE MOHICAN MAINTAINED HIS FIRM AND HAUGHTY ATTITUDE AND HIS EYES SO FAR FROM DEIGNING TO MEET HER INQUISITIVE LOOK
YOUR SQUAWS ARE THE MOTHERS OF DEER BUT IF A BEAR OR A WILDCAT OR A SERPENT WERE BORN AMONG YOU YE WOULD FLEE THE HURON GIRLS SHALL MAKE YOU PETTICOATS AND WE WILL FIND YOU A HUSBAND
AS IF TO INQUIRE INTO THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF THE DECLARATION WITH AN INTELLIGENCE AND KEENNESS THAT CAUSED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR SCRUTINY TO TREMBLE FOR THE RESULT HE WAS HOWEVER RELIEVED AGAIN BY THE FORMER SPEAKER
IN WHICH MALICIOUS DEMONS HAD ASSEMBLED TO ACT THEIR BLOODY AND LAWLESS RITES THE FORMS IN THE BACKGROUND LOOKED LIKE UNEARTHLY BEINGS GLIDING BEFORE THE EYE AND CLEAVING THE AIR WITH FRANTIC AND UNMEANING GESTURES
NOR EVEN THE FASHION OF A GARMENT UNHEEDED AND WITHOUT COMMENT AT LENGTH ONE WHOSE HAIR WAS BEGINNING TO BE SPRINKLED WITH GRAY BUT WHOSE SINEWY LIMBS AND FIRM TREAD ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS STILL EQUAL TO THE DUTIES OF MANHOOD
HE SAW HIM QUIETLY LEANING AGAINST A SMALL PAINTED POST WHICH STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE APPREHENSIVE THAT THE PART HE HAD TAKEN IN THE ESCAPE MIGHT PROVE FATAL TO HIMSELF DUNCAN LEFT THE PLACE WITHOUT DELAY HE FOLLOWED THE CROWD
TO ALL THIS THE CAPTIVE MADE NO REPLY BUT WAS CONTENT TO PRESERVE AN ATTITUDE IN WHICH DIGNITY WAS SINGULARLY BLENDED WITH DISDAIN EXASPERATED AS MUCH BY HIS COMPOSURE AS BY HIS GOOD FORTUNE THEIR WORDS BECAME UNINTELLIGIBLE
DO THE CUNNING MEN OF THE CANADAS PAINT THEIR SKINS THE HURON COLDLY CONTINUED WE HAVE HEARD THEM BOAST THAT THEIR FACES WERE PALE
NO GAP HAD BEEN LEFT BETWEEN SHOULDER AND SHOULDER THAT WAS NOT NOW FILLED WITH THE DARK LINEAMENTS OF SOME EAGER AND CURIOUS HUMAN COUNTENANCE IN THE MEANTIME THE MORE AGED CHIEFS IN THE CENTER COMMUNED WITH EACH OTHER IN SHORT AND BROKEN SENTENCES
BUT HIS INGENUITY AVAILED HIM LITTLE AGAINST THE COLD ARTIFICES OF THE PEOPLE HE HAD ENCOUNTERED THE CHIEFS IN FRONT SCARCE CAST A GLANCE AT HIS PERSON KEEPING THEIR EYES ON THE GROUND WITH AN AIR THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR RESPECT
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE AGED THE INFORM THE ACTIVE AND THE STRONG WERE ALIKE ABROAD SOME EXCLAIMING ALOUD OTHERS CLAPPING THEIR HANDS WITH A JOY THAT SEEMED FRANTIC AND ALL
WHILE THE SAVAGE PASSIONS OF SUCH AS PASSED THE FLAMES WERE RENDERED FEARFULLY DISTINCT BY THE GLEAMS THAT SHOT ATHWART THEIR INFLAMED VISAGES IT WILL EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT AMID SUCH A CONCOURSE OF VINDICTIVE ENEMIES NO BREATHING TIME WAS ALLOWED THE FUGITIVE
ARMS GLEAMING KNIVES AND FORMIDABLE CLUBS APPEARED ABOVE THEM BUT THE BLOWS WERE EVIDENTLY GIVEN AT RANDOM THE AWFUL EFFECT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE PIERCING SHRIEKS OF THE WOMEN AND THE FIERCE YELLS OF THE WARRIORS
HE LOOKS TO SEE THAT NO ENEMIES ARE ON HIS TRAIL THE CANOE OF A DEAD WARRIOR WILL NOT FLOAT ON THE HORICAN RETURNED THE SAVAGE GLOOMILY HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THE DELAWARES
THAT FAR EXCEEDED ANY BEFORE HEARD THE MORE ABJECT OF THE TWO VICTIMS CONTINUED MOTIONLESS BUT THE OTHER BOUNDED FROM THE PLACE AT THE CRY WITH THE ACTIVITY AND SWIFTNESS OF A DEER INSTEAD OF RUSHING THROUGH THE HOSTILE LINES AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED
THOUGH IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE GOVERNED BY VERY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS WHILE ONE STOOD ERECT AND FIRM PREPARED TO MEET HIS FATE LIKE A HERO THE OTHER BOWED HIS HEAD AS IF PALSIED BY TERROR OR STRICKEN WITH SHAME
WHO HAD TAKEN THE NECESSARY PRECAUTION TO FIRE THE PILES MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG AND CLEARED A PLACE FOR HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAPTIVE THE SQUALID AND WITHERED PERSON OF THIS HAG MIGHT WELL HAVE OBTAINED FOR HER THE CHARACTER OF POSSESSING MORE THAN HUMAN CUNNING
REST IN PEACE TILL THE MORNING SUN WHEN OUR LAST WORDS SHALL BE SPOKEN SEVEN NIGHTS AND AS MANY SUMMER DAYS HAVE I FASTED ON THE TRAIL OF THE HURONS UNCAS COLDLY REPLIED
EXPENDED IN VAIN FOR ALTHOUGH DISTINGUISHED IN HER NATION AS A PROFICIENT IN THE ART OF ABUSE SHE WAS PERMITTED TO WORK HERSELF INTO SUCH A FURY AS ACTUALLY TO FOAM AT THE MOUTH WITHOUT CAUSING A MUSCLE TO VIBRATE IN THE MOTIONLESS FIGURE OF THE STRANGER
THE WARRIORS JUST ARRIVED WERE THE MOST DISTANT FIGURES A LITTLE IN ADVANCE STOOD TWO MEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY SELECTED FROM THE REST AS THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
WHO ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS AND THEY FILL THEM WITH LIES IT CANNOT BE SEE HE HAS BID ME WHO AM A MAN THAT KNOWS THE ART OF HEALING TO GO TO HIS CHILDREN
RESUMED THE OTHER WITHOUT APPEARING TO REGARD THE BOAST OF HIS CAPTIVE WHEN THEY GET BACK THEN WILL OUR WISE MAN SAY TO YOU LIVE OR DIE HAS A HURON NO EARS SCORNFULLY EXCLAIMED UNCAS
THE SILENCE WAS FINALLY BROKEN BY THE AGED WARRIOR SO OFTEN NAMED HE AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND MOVING PAST THE IMMOVABLE FORM OF UNCAS PLACED HIMSELF IN A DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE BEFORE THE OFFENDER AT THAT MOMENT
A FEW MINUTES WERE CONSUMED IN DISPOSING OF THOSE PRESENT IN A MANNER SUITABLE TO THEIR RANK AND INFLUENCE IN THE TRIBE AN ORDER VERY SIMILAR TO THAT ADOPTED IN THE PRECEDING INTERVIEW WAS OBSERVED THE AGED AND SUPERIOR CHIEFS OCCUPYING THE AREA OF THE SPACIOUS APARTMENT
PLAINLY BETRAYED THEIR ADMIRATION OF THE STRANGER'S DARING THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM DUNCAN HAD OBSERVED TO STAND FORTH WITH HIS FRIEND PREVIOUSLY TO THE DESPERATE TRIAL OF SPEED AND WHO INSTEAD OF JOINING IN THE CHASE HAD REMAINED
AS THE WEAPON PASSED SLOWLY INTO HIS HEART HE EVEN SMILED AS IF IN JOY AT HAVING FOUND DEATH LESS DREADFUL THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED AND FELL HEAVILY ON HIS FACE AT THE FEET OF THE RIGID AND UNYIELDING FORM OF UNCAS
HE SEES THE DEAD YENGEESE BUT NO HURON WHAT CAN THIS MEAN A GREAT CHIEF LIKE HIM HAS MORE THOUGHTS THAN TONGUES
THE RED HURONS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND ASK IF ANY ARE SICK ANOTHER SILENCE SUCCEEDED THIS ANNUNCIATION OF THE CHARACTER DUNCAN HAD ASSUMED EVERY EYE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY BENT ON HIS PERSON
WHETHER THE COLOR OF THE SKIN BE RED OR BLACK OR WHITE RETURNED DUNCAN EVASIVELY THOUGH CHIEFLY IS HE SATISFIED WITH THE BRAVE HURONS IN WHAT MANNER WILL HE SPEAK
THAT THE DISAPPOINTED WOMEN DID NOT LAVISHLY EXPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL STRANGER THEY FLOUTED AT HIS EFFORTS AND TOLD HIM WITH BITTER SCOFFS THAT HIS FEET WERE BETTER THAN HIS HANDS AND THAT HE MERITED WINGS
AND WERE SUCCEEDED BY SHRILL PIERCING YELLS
EXPRESSING THEIR SAVAGE PLEASURE IN SOME UNEXPECTED EVENT THOUGH ASTOUNDED AT FIRST BY THE UPROAR HEYWARD WAS SOON ENABLED TO FIND ITS SOLUTION BY THE SCENE THAT FOLLOWED THERE YET LINGERED SUFFICIENT LIGHT IN THE HEAVENS
BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER STOOD LEANING IN LAZY LOUNGING ATTITUDES AGAINST THE UPRIGHT POSTS THAT SUPPORTED THE CRAZY BUILDING WHILE THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLDEST AND MOST DISTINGUISHED OF THE CHIEFS PLACED THEMSELVES ON THE EARTH A LITTLE MORE IN ADVANCE
INFURIATED AT THE SELF COMMAND OF THE CAPTIVE THE WOMAN PLACED HER ARMS AKIMBO AND THROWING HERSELF INTO A POSTURE OF DEFIANCE SHE BROKE OUT ANEW IN A TORRENT OF WORDS THAT NO ART OF OURS COULD COMMIT SUCCESSFULLY TO PAPER HER BREATH WAS HOWEVER
LARGE PILES OF BRUSH LAY SCATTERED ABOUT THE CLEARING AND A WARY AND AGED SQUAW WAS OCCUPIED IN FIRING AS MANY AS MIGHT SERVE TO LIGHT THE COMING EXHIBITION AS THE FLAME AROSE
AND AS HE HAD ALREADY PREPARED A SIMPLE AND PROBABLE TALE TO SUPPORT HIS PRETENDED OCCUPATION HIS HOPES OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS GREW BRIGHTER AFTER A SILENCE OF A FEW MOMENTS AS IF ADJUSTING HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER TO MAKE A SUITABLE ANSWER TO THE DECLARATION THEIR GUESTS HAD JUST GIVEN
HUMAN POWER COULD NOT HOWEVER MUCH LONGER ENDURE SO SEVERE A TRIAL OF THIS THE CAPTIVE SEEMED CONSCIOUS PROFITING BY THE MOMENTARY OPENING HE DARTED FROM AMONG THE WARRIORS AND MADE A DESPERATE
THOUGH THEY SEEMED BY THE GESTURES THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM TO BE UTTERED MORE IN COURTESY THAN ANGER THE LATTER SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MADE A GESTURE INDICATIVE OF HIS INABILITY TO REPLY DO NONE OF MY BROTHERS SPEAK THE FRENCH OR THE ENGLISH
HOLDING THE TORCH AND MUTTERING THE INDISTINCT WORDS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SPECIES OF INCANTATION THOUGH HER PRESENCE WAS ALTOGETHER AN INTRUSION IT WAS UNHEEDED
BY ANY LUCKY CONCURRENCE OF ACCIDENTS HAS FOUND MEANS TO ELUDE THE VIGILANCE OF THE SCOUTS WILL SELDOM MEET WITH SENTINELS NEARER HOME TO SOUND THE ALARM IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL USAGE
WHICH WERE STILL RINGING BENEATH THE ARCHES OF THE WOODS UNABLE TO COMMAND HIMSELF ANY LONGER THE YOUTH BROKE FROM THE PLACE AND PRESENTLY STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A DISORDERLY THRONG THAT INCLUDED NEARLY EVERYTHING HAVING LIFE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE ENCAMPMENT
DELAWARE HE SAID THOUGH ONE OF A NATION OF WOMEN YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF A MAN I WOULD GIVE YOU FOOD BUT HE WHO EATS WITH A HURON SHOULD BECOME HIS FRIEND
BUT THEY PROVED TO BE THOSE OF A STRANGER AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE INEXPLICABLE OF ONE WHO BORE ALL THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF A HURON WARRIOR INSTEAD OF MINGLING WITH HIS TRIBE HOWEVER HE SAT APART A SOLITARY BEING IN A MULTITUDE
DEMANDED THE WARY CHIEF WHEN THE RUNNERS COUNT TO HIM THE SCALPS WHICH FIVE NIGHTS AGO GREW ON THE HEADS OF THE YENGEESE THEY WERE HIS ENEMIES SAID DUNCAN SHUDDERING INVOLUNTARILY
AND LEAPING THE HEADS OF A ROW OF CHILDREN HE GAINED AT ONCE THE EXTERIOR AND SAFER SIDE OF THE FORMIDABLE ARRAY THE ARTIFICE WAS ANSWERED BY A HUNDRED VOICES RAISED IN IMPRECATIONS AND THE WHOLE OF THE EXCITED MULTITUDE BROKE FROM THEIR ORDER
TO EXHIBIT THOSE BRIGHT OPENINGS AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE DIFFERENT PATHS LEFT THE CLEARING TO ENTER THE DEPTHS OF THE WILDERNESS BENEATH ONE OF THEM A LINE OF WARRIORS ISSUED FROM THE WOODS AND ADVANCED SLOWLY TOWARD THE DWELLINGS ONE IN FRONT BORE A SHORT POLE
THE EFFECT OF HIS INDIFFERENCE BEGAN TO EXTEND ITSELF TO THE OTHER SPECTATORS AND A YOUNGSTER WHO WAS JUST QUITTING THE CONDITION OF A BOY TO ENTER THE STATE OF MANHOOD ATTEMPTED TO ASSIST THE TERMAGANT
SECONDED BY SUCH NOBLE RESOLUTION COULD BEAR ONE HARMLESS THROUGH SO SEVERE A TRIAL THE YOUTHFUL CAPTIVE BEFORE HIM MIGHT HOPE FOR SUCCESS IN THE HAZARDOUS RACE HE WAS ABOUT TO RUN INSENSIBLY
HE TRUSTED TO THE DISCRETION OF HIS COMPANION WHOSE FOOTSTEPS HE CLOSELY FOLLOWED ENDEAVORING AS HE PROCEEDED TO RALLY HIS THOUGHTS FOR THE OCCASION HIS BLOOD CURDLED WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ABSOLUTE CONTACT WITH SUCH FIERCE AND IMPLACABLE ENEMIES
GLEAMED ON THE PERSONS OF THOSE WHOSE BREATH WAS HIS FAME AND THE LATTER EMOTION FOR AN INSTANT PREDOMINATED HE AROSE TO HIS FEET AND BARING HIS BOSOM LOOKED STEADILY ON THE KEEN GLITTERING KNIFE THAT WAS ALREADY UPHELD BY HIS INEXORABLE JUDGE
AND GENTLY PUSHED HER ASIDE REED THAT BENDS HE SAID ADDRESSING THE YOUNG CULPRIT BY NAME AND IN HIS PROPER LANGUAGE THOUGH THE GREAT SPIRIT HAS MADE YOU PLEASANT TO THE EYES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN BORN
AS MORE INTELLIGIBLE TO THE SUBJECT OF HER GIBES SHE COMMENCED ALOUD LOOK YOU DELAWARE SHE SAID SNAPPING HER FINGERS IN HIS FACE YOUR NATION IS A RACE OF WOMEN
AS THOUGH IMPELLED BY A FATE TO WHOSE DECREES HE SUBMITTED SEEMINGLY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HEYWARD PROFITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GAZE IN HIS FACE SECRETLY APPREHENSIVE HE MIGHT FIND THE FEATURES OF ANOTHER ACQUAINTANCE
ANOTHER WARRIOR AROSE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN AN ATTITUDE TO SPEAK WHILE HIS LIPS WERE YET IN THE ACT OF PARTING A LOW BUT FEARFUL SOUND AROSE FROM THE FOREST AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED BY A HIGH SHRILL YELL THAT WAS DRAWN OUT
AND BREATHING THICK AND HARD AFTER HIS EXERTIONS BUT DISDAINING TO PERMIT A SINGLE SIGN OF SUFFERING TO ESCAPE HIS PERSON WAS NOW PROTECTED BY IMMEMORIAL AND SACRED USAGE UNTIL THE TRIBE IN COUNCIL HAD DELIBERATED AND DETERMINED ON HIS FATE
EVERY EYE ROLLED SULLENLY TOWARD THE INDIVIDUAL INDICATED BY THE SIMPLE GESTURE AND A LOW THREATENING MURMUR PASSED THROUGH THE CROWD THE OMINOUS SOUNDS REACHED THE OUTER DOOR AND THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN PRESSING INTO THE THRONG
BUT SO SOON AS THEY WERE OBSERVED THE WHOLE OF THE JUVENILE PACK RAISED BY COMMON CONSENT A SHRILL AND WARNING WHOOP AND THEN SANK AS IT WERE BY MAGIC FROM BEFORE THE SIGHT OF THEIR VISITORS
HIS FORM SHRINKING INTO A CROUCHING AND ABJECT ATTITUDE AS IF ANXIOUS TO FILL AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL HAD TAKEN HIS PROPER STATION AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE PLACE THE GRAY HAIRED CHIEF ALREADY INTRODUCED TO THE READER
ITS POWER EXCEEDED THAT OF THE PARTING DAY AND ASSISTED TO RENDER OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HIDEOUS THE WHOLE SCENE FORMED A STRIKING PICTURE WHOSE FRAME WAS COMPOSED OF THE DARK AND TALL BORDER OF PINES
THE LIGHT RENDERED EVERY LIMB AND JOINT DISCERNIBLE AND DUNCAN TURNED AWAY IN HORROR WHEN HE SAW THEY WERE WRITHING IN IRREPRESSIBLE AGONY THE WOMAN WAS COMMENCING A LOW AND PLAINTIVE HOWL AT THE SAD AND SHAMEFUL SPECTACLE WHEN THE CHIEF PUT FORTH HIS HAND
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE MOHICAN TO ALLUDE TO THE FATAL RIFLE OF THE SCOUT BENT FORWARD IN EARNEST OBSERVATION OF THE EFFECT IT MIGHT PRODUCE ON THE CONQUERORS BUT THE CHIEF WAS CONTENT WITH SIMPLY RETORTING
IN WORDS THAT WERE FAR FROM APPALLING THOUGH NOT MORE INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE FOR WHOSE EARS THEY WERE INTENDED THAN THEIR EXPRESSIVE YELLS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONVEY A SUITABLE IDEA OF THE SAVAGE ECSTASY WITH WHICH THE NEWS THUS IMPARTED WAS RECEIVED
BUT WHICH IT WAS QUITE EASY TO CONSTRUE INTO DISTRUST
GRAVELY AWAITING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THOSE WHO HAD UNEXPECTEDLY COME AMONG THEM DAVID IN SOME MEASURE FAMILIARIZED TO THE SCENE LED THE WAY WITH A STEADINESS THAT NO SLIGHT OBSTACLE WAS LIKELY TO DISCONCERT INTO THIS VERY BUILDING
WITHIN THE POWERFUL LIGHT OF A GLARING TORCH WHILE THEIR JUNIORS AND INFERIORS WERE ARRANGED IN THE BACKGROUND PRESENTING A DARK OUTLINE OF SWARTHY AND MARKED VISAGES IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE LODGE
PRESSED CLOSE UPON HIS HEELS AND WITH AN UPLIFTED ARM MENACED A FATAL BLOW DUNCAN THRUST FORTH A FOOT AND THE SHOCK PRECIPITATED THE EAGER SAVAGE HEADLONG MANY FEET IN ADVANCE OF HIS INTENDED VICTIM
BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES THREE TIMES HAVE THEY CALLED ON YOU TO COME AND AS OFTEN DID YOU FORGET TO ANSWER YOUR NAME WILL NEVER BE MENTIONED AGAIN IN YOUR TRIBE IT IS ALREADY FORGOTTEN
DASHED THE TORCH TO THE EARTH AND BURIED EVERYTHING IN DARKNESS THE WHOLE SHUDDERING GROUP OF SPECTATORS GLIDED FROM THE LODGE LIKE TROUBLED SPRITES AND DUNCAN THOUGHT THAT HE AND THE YET THROBBING BODY OF THE VICTIM OF AN INDIAN JUDGMENT
YOUR TONGUE IS LOUD IN THE VILLAGE BUT IN BATTLE IT IS STILL NONE OF MY YOUNG MEN STRIKE THE TOMAHAWK DEEPER INTO THE WAR POST NONE OF THEM SO LIGHTLY ON THE YENGEESE THE ENEMY KNOW THE SHAPE OF YOUR BACK
BREATHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT AND HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH THE CRITICAL SITUATION OF HIS FRIEND HEYWARD RECOILED BEFORE THE LOOK TREMBLING LEST ITS MEANING MIGHT IN SOME UNKNOWN MANNER HASTEN THE PRISONER'S FATE
EVERY DISAGREEABLE SENSATION WAS QUIETED IN INWARD CONGRATULATION FOR THE OPPORTUNE RELIEF AND INSIGNIFICANCE IT CONFERRED ON HIMSELF WHEN AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE LODGES THE NEWLY ARRIVED WARRIORS HALTED
BY FLOURISHING HIS TOMAHAWK BEFORE THEIR VICTIM AND ADDING HIS EMPTY BOASTS TO THE TAUNTS OF THE WOMEN THEN INDEED THE CAPTIVE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD THE LIGHT AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE STRIPLING WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT WAS SUPERIOR TO CONTEMPT
WELL INFORMED OF THE APPROACH OF EVERY DANGER WHILE IT IS YET AT A DISTANCE THE INDIAN GENERALLY RESTS SECURE UNDER HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SIGNS OF THE FOREST AND THE LONG AND DIFFICULT PATHS THAT SEPARATE HIM FROM THOSE HE HAS MOST REASON TO DREAD BUT THE ENEMY WHO
TO EXHIBIT HIS GENEROUS EMOTIONS HE WATCHED HIS SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT HOWEVER WITH EAGER EYES AND AS HE TRACED THE FINE OUTLINE OF HIS ADMIRABLY PROPORTIONED AND ACTIVE FRAME HE ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IF THE POWERS OF MAN
IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE CANADAS WHEN OUR GREAT FATHER SPEAKS TO HIS PEOPLE IS IT WITH THE TONGUE OF A HURON
THOUGHT ITSELF IS NOT QUICKER THAN WAS THE MOTION WITH WHICH THE LATTER PROFITED BY THE ADVANTAGE HE TURNED GLEAMED LIKE A METEOR AGAIN BEFORE THE EYES OF DUNCAN AND AT THE NEXT MOMENT WHEN THE LATTER RECOVERED HIS RECOLLECTION AND GAZED AROUND IN QUEST OF THE CAPTIVE
AT THE NEXT MOMENT HE RESUMED HIS QUIET AND RECLINING ATTITUDE AGAINST THE POST BUT THE CHANGE OF POSTURE HAD PERMITTED DUNCAN TO EXCHANGE GLANCES WITH THE FIRM AND PIERCING EYES OF UNCAS
AND SEATED HIMSELF IN SILENCE SO SOON AS THEIR VISITOR HAD PASSED THE OBSERVANT WARRIORS FELL BACK FROM THE ENTRANCE AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM THEY SEEMED PATIENTLY TO AWAIT THE MOMENT WHEN IT MIGHT COMPORT WITH THE DIGNITY OF THE STRANGER TO SPEAK
CONTINUED DUNCAN SPEAKING SLOWLY AND USING THE SIMPLEST FRENCH OF WHICH HE WAS THE MASTER TO BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THIS WISE AND BRAVE NATION UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE THAT THE GRAND MONARQUE USES WHEN HE TALKS TO HIS CHILDREN
AND PASSING THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HARMLESS HE APPEARED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CLEARING HERE TOO HE WAS MET AND TURNED BY A FEW OF THE OLDER AND MORE SUBTLE OF THE HURONS ONCE MORE HE TRIED THE THRONG AS IF SEEKING SAFETY IN ITS BLINDNESS
A BURST OF SAVAGE LAUGHTER SUCCEEDED THIS ATTACK DURING WHICH THE SOFT AND MUSICAL MERRIMENT OF THE YOUNGER FEMALES STRANGELY CHIMED WITH THE CRACKED VOICE OF THEIR OLDER AND MORE MALIGNANT COMPANION BUT THE STRANGER WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL THEIR EFFORTS
UNTIL IT EQUALED THE LONGEST AND MOST PLAINTIVE HOWL OF THE WOLF THE SUDDEN AND TERRIBLE INTERRUPTION CAUSED DUNCAN TO START FROM HIS SEAT UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY SO FRIGHTFUL A CRY AT THE SAME MOMENT
NOT A WORD WAS UTTERED THAT DID NOT CONVEY THE MEANING OF THE SPEAKER IN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST ENERGETIC FORM AGAIN A LONG AND DEEPLY SOLEMN PAUSE TOOK PLACE IT WAS KNOWN BY ALL PRESENT TO BE THE BRAVE PRECURSOR OF A WEIGHTY AND IMPORTANT JUDGMENT
BUT THE WHOLE BODY OF HIS CAPTORS THREW THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND DROVE HIM BACK INTO THE CENTER OF HIS RELENTLESS PERSECUTORS TURNING LIKE A HEADED DEER HE SHOT WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN ARROW THROUGH A PILLAR OF FORKED FLAME
NOW AND THEN DUNCAN CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A LIGHT FORM CLEAVING THE AIR IN SOME DESPERATE BOUND AND HE RATHER HOPED THAN BELIEVED THAT THE CAPTIVE YET RETAINED THE COMMAND OF HIS ASTONISHING POWERS OF ACTIVITY
HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TOWARD THE SOLITARY HURON BUT WITHOUT DEIGNING TO BESTOW ANY OTHER NOTICE ON SO UNWORTHY AN OBJECT THE WORDS OF THE ANSWER AND THE AIR OF THE SPEAKER PRODUCED A STRONG SENSATION AMONG HIS AUDITORS
THERE WAS AN INSTANT WHEN THE YOUNG SOLDIER WOULD HAVE RETREATED IT WAS HOWEVER TOO LATE TO APPEAR TO HESITATE THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN HAD DRAWN A DOZEN WARRIORS TO THE DOOR OF THE NEAREST LODGE WHERE THEY STOOD CLUSTERED IN A DARK AND SAVAGE GROUP
A FLARING TORCH WAS BURNING IN THE PLACE AND SET ITS RED GLARE FROM FACE TO FACE AND FIGURE TO FIGURE AS IT WAVED IN THE CURRENTS OF AIR DUNCAN PROFITED BY ITS LIGHT TO READ THE PROBABLE CHARACTER OF HIS RECEPTION
AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLACE IN WILD CONFUSION A DOZEN BLAZING PILES NOW SHED THEIR LURID BRIGHTNESS ON THE PLACE WHICH RESEMBLED SOME UNHALLOWED AND SUPERNATURAL ARENA
THE SQUAWS SEIZED CLUBS AXES OR WHATEVER WEAPON OF OFFENSE FIRST OFFERED ITSELF TO THEIR HANDS AND RUSHED EAGERLY TO ACT THEIR PART IN THE CRUEL GAME THAT WAS AT HAND EVEN THE CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED
AS THE CHIEF SLOWLY UTTERED THESE WORDS PAUSING IMPRESSIVELY BETWEEN EACH SENTENCE THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS FACE IN DEFERENCE TO THE OTHER'S RANK AND YEARS SHAME HORROR AND PRIDE STRUGGLED IN ITS LINEAMENTS HIS EYE WHICH WAS CONTRACTED WITH INWARD ANGUISH
WHEN AN INDIAN CHIEF COMES AMONG HIS WHITE FATHERS RETURNED DUNCAN WITH GREAT STEADINESS
IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL EDIFICE OF THE VILLAGE THOUGH ROUGHLY CONSTRUCTED OF THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF TREES BEING THE LODGE IN WHICH THE TRIBE HELD ITS COUNCILS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS DURING THEIR TEMPORARY RESIDENCE ON THE BORDERS OF THE ENGLISH PROVINCE
THEIR PLAINTIVE AND TERRIFIC CRY WHICH WAS INTENDED TO REPRESENT EQUALLY THE WAILINGS OF THE DEAD AND THE TRIUMPH TO THE VICTORS HAD ENTIRELY CEASED
IMMEDIATELY UNDER AN OPENING THAT ADMITTED THE TWINKLING LIGHT OF ONE OR TWO STARS STOOD UNCAS CALM ELEVATED AND COLLECTED HIS HIGH AND HAUGHTY CARRIAGE WAS NOT LOST ON HIS CAPTORS WHO OFTEN BENT THEIR LOOKS ON HIS PERSON WITH EYES WHICH
MY BROTHERS HAVE GIVEN ME PAINT AND I WEAR IT A LOW MURMUR OF APPLAUSE ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPLIMENT OF THE TRIBE WAS FAVORABLY RECEIVED THE ELDERLY CHIEF MADE A GESTURE OF COMMENDATION
HE SAID IN THE FORMER LANGUAGE LOOKING ABOUT HIM FROM COUNTENANCE TO COUNTENANCE IN HOPES OF FINDING A NOD OF ASSENT THOUGH MORE THAN ONE HAD TURNED AS IF TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS THEY REMAINED UNANSWERED I SHOULD BE GRIEVED TO THINK
SUDDENLY THE MULTITUDE ROLLED BACKWARD AND APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE HE HIMSELF STOOD THE HEAVY BODY IN THE REAR PRESSED UPON THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT AND BORE THEM TO THE EARTH THE STRANGER REAPPEARED IN THE CONFUSION
THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY INSTANT CAUSE FOR SUCH AN APPREHENSION JUST THEN A WARRIOR FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE EXASPERATED CROWD MOTIONING THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ASIDE WITH A STERN GESTURE HE TOOK UNCAS BY THE ARM
DWELT STEADILY ON THE DISTANCE AS THOUGH IT PENETRATED THE OBSTACLES WHICH IMPEDED THE VIEW AND LOOKED INTO FUTURITY SATISFIED WITH HER EXAMINATION SHE LEFT HIM WITH A SLIGHT EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE AND PROCEEDED TO PRACTISE THE SAME TRYING EXPERIMENT
THEY PERCEIVED A STEEL BREASTPLATE ON THE GROUND WHICH BERTRAND RAISED AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS PIERCED THROUGH AND THAT THE LINING WAS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH BLOOD
AFTER WHICH ALL WAS AGAIN STILL SHE COMPLAINED OF COLD AND BEGGED TO GO ON PRESENTLY LADY SAID BERTRAND TURNING OVER SOME BROKEN ARMS WITH THE PIKE HE USUALLY CARRIED
IT SURELY CAME FROM THE RAMPARTS ABOVE AND ON LOOKING UP THEY PERCEIVED A LIGHT MOVING ALONG THE WALLS WHILE IN THE NEXT INSTANT THE BREEZE SWELLING THE VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER THAN BEFORE
THIS IS A NEW CUSTOM SAID HE WHEN I LEFT THE CASTLE THE SIGNORS USED TO SIT UP COUNSELLING AYE AND FOR THAT MATTER CAROUSING TOO REPLIED THE SOLDIER BUT SINCE THE SIEGE THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT MAKE MERRY
SOME DEGREE OF AWE AS IT ROLLED AWAY ON THE BREEZE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER NOTE SUCCEEDED AND DIED IN SULLEN MURMUR AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO HER MOURNFUL IMAGINATION
IN DOUBTFUL JOY AND TENDERNESS AND WHEN THE STRAIN CEASED SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A SIGNAL THAT VALANCOURT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE PRISON SOON AFTER SHE HEARD STEPS IN THE CORRIDOR THEY WERE THE LIGHT
FOR UNDER PRETENCE OF CARRYING IN A PITCHER OF WATER HE ENTERED THE PRISON
SHE GUESSED THAT THE SIGNOR AND HIS GUESTS WERE AT THE BANQUET THEY ARE NOW ENGAGED FOR THE NIGHT SAID SHE AND VALANCOURT WILL SOON BE HERE HAVING SOFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR
MASSY FRAGMENTS HAD ROLLED DOWN AMONG THE WOODS THROUGH WHICH THE TRAVELLERS NOW BEGAN TO ASCEND AND THERE MINGLED WITH THE LOOSE EARTH AND PIECES OF ROCK THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
AT LENGTH THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO LISTEN IF ANY NOISE WAS IN THE CASTLE AND HEARD ONLY DISTANT SHOUTS OF RIOT AND LAUGHTER ECHOED FEEBLY ALONG THE GALLERY
FOR MANY A LONG MONTH LOST IN SNOW PROFOUND WHEN SOL FROM CANCER SENDS THE SEASONS BLAND AND IN THEIR NORTHERN CAVE THE STORMS HATH BOUND FROM SILENT MOUNTAINS STRAIGHT WITH STARTLING SOUND
BUT HESITATED IN TREMBLING EXPECTATION THE CHEVALIER WOULD NOT ENTRUST ME WITH HIS NAME SIGNORA REPLIED LUDOVICO BUT WHEN I JUST MENTIONED YOURS HE SEEMED OVERWHELMED WITH JOY
INDEED WITHOUT ANY SACRIFICE OF HER OWN COMFORT SINCE NO CIRCUMSTANCE HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE HER ESCAPE PROBABLE ON THE FOURTH DAY LUDOVICO INFORMED HER
HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS CONFERENCE WITH THE PRISONER A VERY SHORT ONE EMILY AWAITED THE RESULT IN HER OWN APARTMENT
THE LAMP HE CARRIED GAVE HER A DUSKY VIEW OF THAT TERRIBLE APARTMENT AND SHE ALMOST SUNK UNDER THE RECOLLECTED HORRORS OF THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD DRAWN ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND DISCOVERED THE OBJECT IT WAS MEANT TO CONCEAL
WHOSE MANGLED FORMS EMILY ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE AND SHE AGAIN ENTREATED HER COMPANIONS TO PROCEED WHO WERE HOWEVER
AND EMILY FEARED TO LOOK FORWARD LEST SOME OBJECT OF HORROR SHOULD MEET HER EYE THE PATH WAS OFTEN STREWN WITH BROKEN HEADS OF ARROWS AND WITH SHATTERED REMAINS OF ARMOUR
THAT EXTENDED AT THEIR FEET AND TO THE DISTANT MEDITERRANEAN WHOSE WAVES SHE HAD SO OFTEN WISHED WOULD BEAR HER BACK TO FRANCE THE DISTRESS SHE FELT ON HER RETURN TOWARDS THE PLACE OF HER FORMER SUFFERINGS WAS
AND THEN GAVE SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE SIEGE TO WHICH AS EMILY LISTENED SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE STRONG CONTRAST OF THE PRESENT SCENE WITH THAT WHICH HAD SO LATELY BEEN ACTED HERE
IF HE CAN GET BEYOND THE BARS AND IRON DOORS OF THE CASTLE HE MUST BE CUNNING INDEED BUT THE CHEVALIER DESIRED ME SIGNORA
AS HE GAVE ME THE PICTURE THAT THIS HAS BEEN MY COMPANION AND ONLY SOLACE IN ALL MY MISFORTUNES TELL HER THAT I HAVE WORN IT NEXT MY HEART AND THAT I SENT IT HER AS THE PLEDGE OF AN AFFECTION WHICH CAN NEVER DIE
SO THIS I THINK LADY IS THE WHOLE OF WHAT PASSED HOW LUDOVICO SHALL I REWARD YOU FOR YOUR ZEAL SAID EMILY BUT INDEED I DO NOT NOW POSSESS THE MEANS
AS TO THE PLACE MADEMOISELLE SAID ANNETTE THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE IN THE CASTLE BESIDES THIS CORRIDOR WHERE WE CAN SEE HIM IN SAFETY YOU KNOW AND AS FOR THE HOUR IT MUST BE WHEN ALL THE SIGNORS ARE ASLEEP IF THAT EVER HAPPENS
THAT MONTONI SHOULD HAVE RECOURSE TO THESE DIABOLICAL MEANS OF RUINING A PERSON WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF HAVING ATTEMPTED HIS LIFE IS NOT IN THE LEAST SURPRISING IN THE LETTER
BUT ABOVE ALL LET HIM SEE YOU AGAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND LUDOVICO I THINK IT IS NEEDLESS TO TELL YOU I SHALL VERY ANXIOUSLY LOOK FOR YOU HAVING THEN WISHED HER GOOD NIGHT LUDOVICO DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE
I NEED NOT BID YOU REMEMBER LUDOVICO RESUMED EMILY HOW VERY MUCH INTERESTED I AM IN YOUR SEEING THE CHEVALIER SOON AND WHEN YOU DO SO TELL HIM THAT I HAVE RECEIVED THE PICTURE AND WITH THE SENTIMENTS HE WISHED
PERHAPS THAT SOLDIER GOES AT THIS DEAD HOUR TO WATCH OVER THE CORPSE OF HIS FRIEND THE LITTLE REMAINS OF HER FORTITUDE NOW GAVE WAY TO THE UNITED FORCE OF REMEMBERED AND ANTICIPATED HORRORS
THESE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO FEEL EMOTIONS OF REGRET OR MELANCHOLY FOR ANY ORDINARY INTERESTS EVEN THE REFLECTION THAT SHE HAD RESIGNED THE ESTATES
WHO IS CAROUSING AT THIS LATE HOUR HIS EXCELLENZA AND THE SIGNORS REPLIED THE SOLDIER IT IS A SIGN YOU ARE A STRANGER AT THE CASTLE OR YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION THEY ARE BRAVE SPIRITS THAT DO WITHOUT SLEEP
THOU KNOWEST I HAVE KILLED MY MAN BEFORE NOW
THAT HE HAD HOPES OF BEING ADMITTED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE PRISONER IT BEING THE TURN OF A SOLDIER WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME FAMILIAR TO ATTEND HIM ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE WAS NOT DECEIVED IN HIS HOPE
HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY ORDER OF THE SENATE AND WITHOUT KNOWING OF WHAT HE WAS SUSPECTED WAS CONVEYED TO A PLACE OF CONFINEMENT WHITHER THE MOST STRENUOUS ENQUIRIES OF HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO TRACE HIM
THEY GENERALLY PASS THE NIGHT IN GOOD CHEER WOULD THAT WE WHO KEEP THE WATCH HAD A LITTLE OF IT IT IS COLD WORK PACING THE RAMPARTS SO MANY HOURS OF THE NIGHT IF ONE HAS NO GOOD LIQUOR TO WARM ONE'S HEART
BUT TO HER FOR THE WEALTH OF WORLDS AND THAT I NOW PART WITH IT ONLY IN THE HOPE OF SOON RECEIVING IT FROM HER HANDS TELL HER JUST THEN SIGNORA THE SENTINEL CAME IN AND THE CHEVALIER SAID NO MORE
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROVISION FOR HERSELF AND VALANCOURT FOR LIFE THREW ONLY A LIGHT AND TRANSIENT SHADE UPON HER SPIRITS THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT AND THAT SHE SHOULD SEE HIM SO SOON ALONE OCCUPIED HER HEART
BUT WHEN I CAME AWAY I SAW ONE OR TWO OF THEM LYING UNDER THE TREES AS THEY PROCEEDED THE TORCH THREW A GLOOMY LIGHT UPON THE GROUND AND FAR AMONG THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
BY THE APPREHENSION OF MEETING ANY OF MONTONI'S GUESTS ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR ROOMS AND SHE DISMISSED THE SCRUPLES WHICH DELICACY OPPOSED NOW THAT A SERIOUS DANGER WAS TO BE AVOIDED BY ENCOUNTERING THEM
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ONCE MORE BENEATH THE GLOOMY ARCH AND HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE THAT SEEMED TO SHUT HER FROM THE WORLD FOR EVER IN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS IN THE FIRST COURT OF THE CASTLE
THE STRONG RAYS ENABLED HER ALSO TO PERCEIVE THE RAVAGES WHICH THE SIEGE HAD MADE WITH THE BROKEN WALLS AND SHATTERED BATTLEMENTS FOR THEY WERE NOW AT THE FOOT OF THE STEEP ON WHICH UDOLPHO STOOD
SHE PERCEIVED THROUGH THE BROKEN WALL A SOLDIER WITH A LAMP ASCENDING THE NARROW STAIRCASE THAT WOUND WITHIN THE TOWER AND REMEMBERING THAT IT WAS THE SAME SHE HAD PASSED UP ON THE NIGHT WHEN BARNARDINE
TO A PLACE OF GREATER SECURITY THAN A CASTLE WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME LIABLE TO BE OVERRUN BY HIS ENEMIES TRANQUILLITY BEING ONCE MORE RESTORED TO UDOLPHO
AND GRADUALLY SWELLING LOUDER AS THEY ADVANCED EMILY DISTINGUISHED VOICES OF REVELRY AND LAUGHTER BUT THEY WERE TO HER FAR OTHER THAN SOUNDS OF JOY
FOR THE GROUND IS NOT YET CLEARED OF THE ENEMY HOW EXCLAIMED EMILY ARE ANY OF THE ENEMY HERE THEN NAY I DON'T KNOW FOR THAT NOW HE REPLIED
AND HIS AMBITION AND THE BOLD RIVALSHIP WHICH HE DISCOVERED ON SEVERAL PUBLIC OCCASIONS TO OTHERS AND IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT MERCY WOULD SOFTEN THE RIGOUR OF A LAW
THE SHATTERED CONDITION OF ONE OF THE TOWERS OF THE GREAT GATES BY NO MEANS CONFIRMED THE VALIANT ACCOUNT JUST GIVEN BY UGO OF THE SCAMPERING PARTY WHO IT WAS EVIDENT HAD NOT ONLY MADE A STAND
AND SHE TURNED HER EYES FROM THIS DESOLATED SCENE TO THE CASTLE ABOVE WHERE SHE OBSERVED LIGHTS GLIDING ALONG THE RAMPARTS PRESENTLY THE CASTLE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE
AND IF I WAS THEY I WOULD SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH MYSELF
THERE ARE NOT MORE THAN ONE OR TWO AMONG THEM
BUT HAD DONE MUCH MISCHIEF BEFORE THEY TOOK TO FLIGHT FOR THIS TOWER APPEARED AS FAR AS EMILY COULD JUDGE BY THE DIM MOON LIGHT THAT FELL UPON
AND TWILIGHT SHADE AND DARKNESS VEIL THE SCENE AS ON THIS EVENING SHE COUNTED THE NOTES OF THE GREAT CLOCK AND LISTENED TO THE STEPS OF THE SENTINELS
FOR BESIDES THE CANNON FROM THE WALLS OUR ARCHERS ON THE TWO ROUND TOWERS SHOWERED DOWN UPON THEM AT SUCH A RATE THAT BY HOLY PETER THERE WAS NO STANDING IT I NEVER SAW A BETTER SIGHT IN MY LIFE
WHILE FROM SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE MENTIONED SHE NOT ONLY DOUBTED WHETHER MONTONI MEANT EVER TO RELEASE HER BUT GREATLY FEARED THAT HE HAD DESIGNS CONCERNING HER SUCH AS SHE HAD FORMERLY DREADED
YOU MAY MENTION THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE CHEVALIER LUDOVICO SAID SHE CHECKING THE FLIPPANCY OF ANNETTE AND LEAVE THEM TO HIS JUDGMENT AND OPPORTUNITY TELL HIM MY HEART IS UNCHANGED
WERE MORE URGENT THAN EVER AT LENGTH HE INFORMED HER THAT HE HAD AGAIN VISITED THE CHEVALIER WHO HAD DIRECTED HIM TO CONFIDE IN THE GUARD OF THE PRISON
HERE HAS BEEN WARM WORK BY SAINT MARCO CRIED BERTRAND WAVING A TORCH OVER THE GROUND THE BALLS HAVE TORN UP THE EARTH HERE WITH A VENGEANCE
BUT WITH JUSTICE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE POISONED CUP MONTONI HAD SUSPECTED MORANO BUT BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE DEGREE OF PROOF WHICH WAS NECESSARY TO CONVICT HIM OF A GUILTY INTENTION
BUT UPON EMILY'S EARNEST ENTREATIES THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED BERTRAND UTTERING SOME JOKE UPON THE UNFORTUNATE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAD BELONGED THREW IT HARD UPON THE GROUND AND THEY PASSED ON
HOWEVER SOFTENED BY A CONJECTURE THAT VALANCOURT WAS THERE AND SHE FOUND SOME DEGREE OF COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF BEING NEAR HIM NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONSIDERATION THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A PRISONER
IT WAS SETTLED THEREFORE THAT THE CHEVALIER SHOULD MEET HER IN THE CORRIDOR AT THAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT WHICH LUDOVICO WHO WAS TO BE UPON THE WATCH SHOULD JUDGE SAFEST AND EMILY
WHAT HAVE WE HERE HARK CRIED EMILY WHAT NOISE WAS THAT WHAT NOISE WAS IT SAID UGO STARTING UP AND LISTENING HUSH REPEATED EMILY
SAID LUDOVICO MOST CERTAINLY I WILL REPLIED EMILY BUT WHEN SIGNORA AND WHERE THAT MUST DEPEND UPON CIRCUMSTANCES RETURNED EMILY THE PLACE AND THE HOUR MUST BE REGULATED BY HIS OPPORTUNITIES
FROM WHOM HE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED SOME INSTANCES OF KINDNESS AND WHO HAD PROMISED TO PERMIT HIS GOING INTO THE CASTLE FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE ENSUING NIGHT WHEN MONTONI AND HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD BE ENGAGED
AND HE BLEW A SHRILL WHISTLE WHICH SIGNAL WAS ANSWERED BY ANOTHER FROM THE SOLDIER ON WATCH AND THE PARTY THEN PASSING FORWARD SOON AFTER EMERGED FROM THE WOODS UPON THE BROKEN ROAD
WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AS THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS REVENGE HE ACCUSED MORANO OF DESIGNS AGAINST THE STATE WHICH HE ATTEMPTED TO PROVE WITH ALL THE PLAUSIBLE SIMPLICITY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER AND THE SENATE
WHEN UDOLPHO WAS ONCE MORE LEFT TO THE QUIET POSSESSION OF MONTONI HE DISPATCHED UGO INTO TUSCANY FOR EMILY WHOM HE HAD SENT FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF HER PERSONAL SAFETY
FOR TO HIS PROTECTION ONLY COULD SHE ATTRIBUTE HER PRESENT REPOSE AND IN THIS SHE WAS NOW SO SECURE THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE THE CASTLE TILL SHE COULD OBTAIN SOME CERTAINTY CONCERNING VALANCOURT FOR WHICH SHE WAITED
HER NAME WAS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED IN THE CONVERSATIONS WHICH BERTOLINI AND VEREZZI HELD TOGETHER AND AT THOSE TIMES THEY WERE FREQUENTLY IN CONTENTION
QUICK STEPS OF HOPE SHE COULD SCARCELY SUPPORT HERSELF AS THEY APPROACHED BUT OPENING THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT SHE ADVANCED TO MEET VALANCOURT AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT SUNK IN THE ARMS OF A STRANGER
BUT IT SHONE ONLY AT INTERVALS FOR THE NIGHT WAS CLOUDY AND LIGHTED BY THE TORCH WHICH UGO CARRIED THE TRAVELLERS PACED SILENTLY ALONG EMILY MUSING ON HER SITUATION AND BERTRAND AND UGO ANTICIPATING
HE CROWED AS LOUD AS THE BEST OF THEM IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL THERE HE WAS ROARING OUT IN THE HOTTEST FIRE I HAVE SEEN THIS MANY A DAY
THE GROANS OF THE CONQUERED AND THE SHOUTS OF THE CONQUERORS WERE NOW SUNK INTO A SILENCE SO PROFOUND THAT IT SEEMED AS IF DEATH HAD TRIUMPHED ALIKE OVER THE VANQUISHED AND THE VICTOR
AND THE TOWER TOO THE ROAD WINDING ROUND THE BASE OF A MOUNTAIN THEY NOW CAME WITHIN VIEW OF THE CASTLE WHICH WAS SHEWN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VALLEY BY A GLEAM OF MOON SHINE AND THEN VANISHED IN SHADE
COURAGE MY LAD COURAGE OUGHT TO WARM YOUR HEART SAID UGO COURAGE REPLIED THE SOLDIER SHARPLY WITH A MENACING AIR WHICH UGO PERCEIVING PREVENTED HIS SAYING MORE BY RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF THE CAROUSAL
AND SHE WANDERED ONCE MORE IN FAIRY SCENES OF UNFADING HAPPINESS AS WHEN BENEATH THE BEAM OF SUMMER MOONS THE DISTANT WOODS AMONG OR BY SOME FLOOD ALL SILVER'D WITH THE GLEAM
THAT THERE WAS A PRISONER IN THE APARTMENT DESCRIBED TO HIM BY EMILY AND THAT HE WAS A FRENCHMAN WHOM THEY HAD TAKEN IN ONE OF THEIR SKIRMISHES WITH A PARTY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN DURING THIS INTERVAL
THAT LED IMMEDIATELY TO THE CASTLE GATES AND EMILY SAW WITH RENEWED TERROR THE WHOLE OF THAT STUPENDOUS STRUCTURE ALAS SAID SHE TO HERSELF I AM GOING AGAIN INTO MY PRISON
AT THEIR CAROUSALS THIS WAS KIND TO BE SURE ADDED LUDOVICO BUT SEBASTIAN KNOWS HE RUNS NO RISQUE IN LETTING THE CHEVALIER OUT FOR
AND I MADE BOLD TO SAY YOU HAD FOR HIM HE THEN ENQUIRED HOW YOU CAME TO KNOW HE WAS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER YOU ORDERED ME TO SPEAK TO HIM THE FIRST QUESTION I COULD NOT ANSWER
AND HE FEARED TO AWAKEN CURIOSITY BY ASKING TO SEE THEIR PRISONER IN THIS INTERVAL HE COMMUNICATED TO EMILY TERRIFIC REPORTS OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE CASTLE OF RIOTS QUARRELS AND OF CAROUSALS MORE ALARMING THAN EITHER
HERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM GIVE ME THE TORCH CONTINUED UGO AFTER THEY HAD DISMOUNTED AND TAKE CARE YOU DON'T STUMBLE OVER ANY THING
IT WAS NOON WHEN SHE HAD LEFT THE COTTAGE AND THE EVENING WAS CLOSED LONG BEFORE SHE CAME WITHIN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF UDOLPHO THERE WAS A MOON
SHE DISTINGUISHED THE CHORDS OF THE LUTE STRUCK WITH AN EXPRESSIVE HAND AND THEN THE VOICE SHE HAD FORMERLY LISTENED TO ACCOMPANIED IT NOW RISING LOVE THEY FANN'D NOW PLEASING DOLE
SHE PACED THE ROOM WITH IMPATIENT STEPS AND OFTEN WENT TO THE CASEMENT TO LISTEN FOR THE LUTE BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND HER AGITATION EVERY MOMENT INCREASING SHE WAS AT LENGTH UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF
WHILE WE HERE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING YOU WILL NOT REST TILL YOU MEET WITH YOUR MATCH SAID BERTRAND SULLENLY HAH MY COMRADE IS IT YOU SAID THE SOLDIER
HE WAS IMPATIENT TO SECURE HER AGAIN UNDER HIS ROOF AND HAD COMMISSIONED UGO TO ASSIST BERTRAND IN GUARDING HER BACK TO THE CASTLE THUS COMPELLED TO RETURN EMILY BADE THE KIND MADDELINA FAREWELL WITH REGRET
ALMOST EQUAL TO A PROOF ARRESTED THE COUNT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACCUSATION AND WITHOUT EVEN HINTING TO HIM HIS CRIME THREW HIM INTO ONE OF THOSE SECRET PRISONS WHICH WERE THE TERROR OF THE VENETIANS
AND EMILY RETIRED TO REST BUT NOT TO SLEEP FOR JOY NOW RENDERED HER AS WAKEFUL AS SHE HAD EVER BEEN FROM GRIEF MONTONI AND HIS CASTLE HAD ALL VANISHED FROM HER MIND LIKE THE FRIGHTFUL VISION OF A NECROMANCER
THE COMFORTS OF A FLASK OF WINE AND A GOOD FIRE FOR THEY HAD PERCEIVED FOR SOME TIME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WARM CLIMATE OF THE LOWLANDS OF TUSCANY AND THE NIPPING AIR OF THESE UPPER REGIONS EMILY WAS AT LENGTH
AND THEN THE HEAVY CHAIN FALL AND THE BOLTS UNDRAW OF A SMALL POSTERN DOOR WHICH HE OPENED TO ADMIT THE PARTY HE HELD THE LAMP LOW TO SHEW THE STEP OF THE GATE
JUST AS YOU SAID SIGNORA AND THE PLACE HE DESIRED YOU WOULD APPOINT AS KNOWING WHICH WAS BEST FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY EMILY WAS NOW SO MUCH AGITATED BY THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MEETING VALANCOURT
SURELY I HAVE NOT LOST IT ADDED HE THE CHEVALIER SAID HE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN MADAM IF HE HAD HAD PEN AND INK AND WAS GOING TO HAVE SENT A VERY LONG MESSAGE WHEN THE SENTINEL ENTERED THE ROOM
THE SOFT EMBODIED FAYS THRO AIRY PORTALS STREAM A WEEK ELAPSED BEFORE LUDOVICO AGAIN VISITED THE PRISON FOR THE SENTINELS DURING THAT PERIOD WERE MEN IN WHOM HE COULD NOT CONFIDE
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING SOMEWHAT OF THE JOY OF HOPE THEY CONTINUED TO WIND ALONG THE VALLEY AND SOON AFTER SHE SAW AGAIN THE OLD WALLS AND MOON LIT TOWERS RISING OVER THE WOODS
THAT ANOTHER HOUR WAS GONE O VALANCOURT SAID SHE AFTER ALL I HAVE SUFFERED
WHILE EVEN A TRANSIENT VIEW OF IT HAD AWAKENED THE POIGNANCY OF EMILY'S FEELINGS ITS MASSY AND GLOOMY WALLS GAVE HER TERRIBLE IDEAS OF IMPRISONMENT AND SUFFERING YET AS SHE ADVANCED
IF ONE MAY JUDGE FROM THAT HE WAS VERY WELL BUT I DID NOT ASK HIM DID HE SEND ME NO MESSAGE SAID EMILY O YES SIGNORA AND SOMETHING BESIDES REPLIED LUDOVICO WHO SEARCHED HIS POCKETS
THE WOODS TOO HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM THE BATTERIES ABOVE FOR HERE THE ENEMY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO SCREEN THEMSELVES FROM THE FIRE OF THE RAMPARTS MANY NOBLE TREES WERE LEVELLED WITH THE GROUND
WHEN CAN YOU SEE THE CHEVALIER AGAIN THAT IS UNCERTAIN SIGNORA REPLIED HE
AND BRANCHES OF THE TREES THAT HAD SO LATELY ADORNED IT AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A SPOT PARTICULARLY FATAL TO THE BESIEGERS FOR IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TREES
LUDOVICO HAVING PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY ANNETTE TO THE CORRIDOR IN THE EVENING WHERE AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IMPATIENTLY COUNTED HE ARRIVED EMILY HAVING THEN UTTERED THE NAME OF VALANCOURT COULD ARTICULATE NO MORE
THEY MIGHT NOT APPEASE HIS VENGEANCE WHICH WAS SELDOM PACIFIED BUT BY A TERRIBLE SACRIFICE
THE PEASANT'S HEART O'ERFLOW BEATTIE SEVERAL OF HER SUCCEEDING DAYS PASSED IN SUSPENSE FOR LUDOVICO COULD ONLY LEARN FROM THE SOLDIERS
WHO THE ENEMY WAS THAT HAD OCCASIONED HIM THIS CALAMITY HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GUESS UNLESS INDEED IT WAS MONTONI ON WHOM HIS SUSPICIONS RESTED AND NOT ONLY WITH MUCH APPARENT PROBABILITY
SOME DEGREE OF HOPE MINGLED WITH HER TERROR FOR THOUGH THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE RESIDENCE OF MONTONI IT WAS POSSIBLY ALSO THAT OF VALANCOURT AND SHE COULD NOT APPROACH A PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT BE
IT SEEMED A KNELL MEASURING OUT SOME FATEFUL PERIOD FOR HER AYE THERE IS THE OLD CLOCK SAID BERTRAND THERE HE IS STILL THE CANNON HAVE NOT SILENCED HIM
THAT WERE SHE TO RESIGN THEM THE FEAR OF JUSTICE MIGHT URGE HIM EITHER TO DETAIN HER A PRISONER OR TO TAKE AWAY HER LIFE THEY WERE NOW ARRIVED AT THE GATES WHERE BERTRAND
HE HAD RECOURSE TO MEANS OF OTHER REVENGE THAN HE COULD HOPE TO OBTAIN BY PROSECUTION HE EMPLOYED A PERSON IN WHOM HE BELIEVED HE MIGHT CONFIDE TO DROP A LETTER OF ACCUSATION INTO
OR LIONS MOUTHS WHICH ARE FIXED IN A GALLERY OF THE DOGE'S PALACE AS RECEPTACLES FOR ANONYMOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING PERSONS WHO MAY BE DISAFFECTED TOWARDS THE STATE
HIS CASTLE WAS BESIEGED BY TROOPS WHO SEEMED WILLING TO DARE EVERY THING AND TO SUFFER PATIENTLY ANY HARDSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF VICTORY THE STRENGTH OF THE FORTRESS HOWEVER WITHSTOOD THEIR ATTACK
AS ON THESE OCCASIONS THE ACCUSER IS NOT CONFRONTED WITH THE ACCUSED A MAN MAY FALSELY IMPEACH HIS ENEMY AND ACCOMPLISH AN UNJUST REVENGE WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT OR DETECTION
AND IN WHICH PERSONS OFTEN LANGUISHED AND SOMETIMES DIED WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED BY THEIR FRIENDS MORANO HAD INCURRED THE PERSONAL RESENTMENT OF MANY MEMBERS OF THE STATE
TORRENTS ARE HURL'D GREEN HILLS EMERGE AND LO THE TREES WITH FOLIAGE CLIFFS WITH FLOW'RS ARE CROWN'D PURE RILLS THROUGH VALES OF VERDURE WARBLING GO AND WONDER LOVE AND JOY
THE CAUSE OF THEM HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW DESTRUCTION APPROACHING IN MANY FORMS AND HER ENTREATIES TO LUDOVICO TO CONTRIVE AN ESCAPE AND TO SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN
TO BRING BACK YOUR ANSWER AND HE WOULD INFORM ME
AS MAY BE IMAGINED PASSED THIS INTERVAL IN A TUMULT OF HOPE AND JOY ANXIETY AND IMPATIENCE NEVER SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN THE CASTLE HAD SHE WATCHED WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE THE SUN SET BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS
AND SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW ANNETTE WHOM SHE DETAINED WAS IN THE MEANTIME AS LOQUACIOUS AS USUAL BUT EMILY HEARD SCARCELY ANY THING SHE SAID AND HAVING AT LENGTH RISEN TO THE CASEMENT
BUT THE SECOND I DID AND THEN HE WENT OFF INTO HIS ECSTASIES AGAIN I WAS AFRAID HIS JOY WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM TO THE SENTINEL AT THE DOOR BUT HOW DOES HE LOOK LUDOVICO INTERRUPTED EMILY
AND TO BEG YOU WOULD ALLOW HIM TO VISIT YOU THIS NIGHT IF IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THAT HE COULD NO LONGER LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITHOUT SEEING YOU THE HOUR HE SAID HE COULD NOT MENTION FOR IT MUST DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THEN A TRUMPET SOUNDED OF WHICH EMILY ENQUIRED THE OCCASION O THEY ARE ONLY CHANGING WATCH REPLIED UGO I DO NOT REMEMBER THIS TRUMPET
WHEN I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER NEVER SEE YOU MORE WE ARE STILL TO MEET AGAIN O I HAVE ENDURED GRIEF AND ANXIETY AND TERROR AND LET ME THEN NOT SINK BENEATH THIS JOY
AT EVERY STEP SHE TOOK EMILY FEARED TO SEE SOME VESTIGE OF DEATH COMING SOON AFTER TO AN OPENING IN THE WOODS BERTRAND STOPPED TO SURVEY THE GROUND WHICH WAS ENCUMBERED WITH MASSY TRUNKS
I SAW NO SYMPTOM OF THAT LADY WHILE I WAS WITH HIM FOR HE SEEMED IN THE FINEST SPIRITS I EVER SAW ANY BODY IN IN ALL MY LIFE HIS COUNTENANCE WAS ALL JOY AND
REPLIED THE SOLDIER WHAT MY OLD COMRADE CRIED UGO DON'T YOU KNOW ME NOT KNOW UGO I HAVE BROUGHT HOME A PRISONER HERE BOUND HAND AND FOOT A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING TUSCANY WINE
AS UGO AND THE SOLDIER CONVERSED TOGETHER ASSISTED TO INCREASE THE MELANCHOLY FOREBODINGS OF HER HEART PASSING ON TO THE SECOND COURT A DISTANT SOUND BROKE FEEBLY ON THE SILENCE
BUT NOT BEFORE HE HAD GIVE ME THIS LUDOVICO THEN DREW FORTH A MINIATURE FROM HIS BOSOM WHICH EMILY RECEIVED WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND PERCEIVED TO BE A PORTRAIT OF HERSELF
WE NOW RETURN FOR A MOMENT TO VENICE WHERE COUNT MORANO WAS SUFFERING UNDER AN ACCUMULATION OF MISFORTUNES SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN THAT CITY
CALLED ALOUD AND THE SOLDIER LOOKING OUT DEMANDED WHO WAS THERE HERE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A PRISONER SAID UGO OPEN THE GATE AND LET US IN TELL ME FIRST WHO IT IS THAT DEMANDS ENTRANCE
BERTRAND MY GOOD FELLOW THOU SHOULDST HAVE BEEN AMONG THEM I WARRANT THOU WOULDST HAVE WON THE RACE HAH YOU ARE AT YOUR OLD TRICKS AGAIN
BRING THE LIGHT HITHER SAID BERTRAND I HAVE STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING THAT RATTLES LOUD ENOUGH
AND OTHERS TO A WIDE EXTENT WERE ENTIRELY STRIPPED OF THEIR UPPER BRANCHES WE HAD BETTER DISMOUNT SAID UGO AND LEAD THE MULES UP THE HILL
AND THE BATTLEMENTS WERE NEARLY DEMOLISHED WHILE SHE GAZED A LIGHT GLIMMERED THROUGH ONE OF THE LOWER LOOP HOLES AND DISAPPEARED
FOR THE MELANCHOLY FATE OF MADAME MONTONI APPEARED TO FORETELL HER OWN SHE CONSIDERED THAT
IF ONE MAY JUDGE BY THE UPROAR THAT IS GOING FORWARD
SAID ANNETTE AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT LUDOVICO WHO UNDERSTOOD HER LOOK AND REPLIED TO EMILY YES LADY THE CHEVALIER DOES INDEED REMEMBER YOU AND I AM SURE HAS A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR YOU
AND AFTER ABOUT A FORTNIGHT'S STAY IN TUSCANY WHERE SHE HAD EXPERIENCED AN INTERVAL OF QUIET WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN HER LONG HARASSED SPIRITS BEGAN ONCE MORE TO ASCEND THE APENNINES
ISABEL'S HEART SANK WITHIN HER AT THE IDEA OF THAT STERN MISS CORNY MOUNTED OVER HER AS RESIDENT GUARD BUT REFINED AND SENSITIVE ALMOST PAINFULLY CONSIDERATE OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS SHE RAISED NO WORD OF OBJECTION
AND YOU ALL OF YOU EVEN MARTIN DREAMS WITHIN A DREAM YOU WEREN'T REAL AND YOU DID NOT MATTER HYPNOTISM MUTTERED DRAKE AS SHE PAUSED NO SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO MORE THAN THAT
AS SHE RAISED IT HE SAW THAT IT WAS FLUSHED AND AGITATED THAT HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND HER FRAME WAS TREMBLING WHAT IS THE MATTER HE HASTILY ASKED I GOT NERVOUS AFTER MARVEL WENT SHE WHISPERED LAYING HOLD OF HIM AS IF FOR PROTECTION FROM TERROR
FINDING IT AN INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT THAT DEMANDS NO SLIGHTEST EXPENDITURE OF MENTAL ENERGY OR INITIATIVE STRENGTH TO SALLY FORTH AGAIN INTO THE UNFAMILIAR I CRAVE PARDON FOR THIS DIGRESSION I SET IT DOWN BECAUSE NOW I REMEMBER HOW
BUT EVEN AS SHE SPOKE HER ACTIONS BELIED HER WORDS MISTER CARLYLE HAD GONE TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT AND SHE FLEW CLOSE UP TO HIM COWERING BEHIND HIM SHALL YOU BE GONE VERY LONG ARCHIBALD SHE WHISPERED NOT MORE THAN AN HOUR HE ANSWERED
YOU MAY AS WELL ASK ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO THE MOON IT IS PAST NINE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE OFFICE FOR A MONTH THE TEARS ROSE IN HER EYES I WISH YOU WOULD BE ALWAYS WITH ME EAST LYNNE WILL NOT BE EAST LYNNE WITHOUT YOU
SHE SPOKE IN A LOW TONE EMBARRASSMENT MAKES COWARDS OF US AND MISTER CARLYLE REPEATED IT AFTER HER HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING THAN SHE DID
THE BEST ROOMS THOSE NEXT THE LIBRARY SHOULD SHE GO UP WITH MY LADY MISTER CARLYLE PREFERRED TO GO HIMSELF AND HE HELD OUT HIS ARM TO ISABEL SHE DREW HER VEIL OVER HER FACE AS SHE PASSED MISS CARLYLE
THE BLAZE OF INTEREST IN DRAKE'S EYES AT THESE QUESTIONS CHANGED TO AMAZEMENT AT HER STRICKEN RECOIL FROM THEM THERE WAS NOTHING SHE WHISPERED THEN DEFIANTLY NOTHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN RUTH
BUT NOT TERRIBLE TO ME WHO WAS PART OF IT VAST CHORDS AND SINGING THEMES THAT RANG LIKE CLUSTERS OF LITTLE SWINGING STARS AND HARMONIES THAT WERE LIKE THE VERY VOICE OF INFINITE LAW RESOLVING WITHIN ITSELF ALL DISCORDS AND ALL
AND KNEW IT WAS NOT FOR AS I SCANNED HER COVERTLY THERE FELL UPON HER FACE THAT SHADOW OF INHUMAN TRANQUILLITY OF UNEARTHLY WITHDRAWAL WHICH I GUESSED HAD MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE MADDENED VENTNOR INTO HIS ATTACK UPON THE DISK I WATCHED HER FIGHT AGAINST IT
AND WHOSE CALLING I WANT GOD HELP ME OH SO DESPERATELY TO HEED IT WHISPERED TO ME FIRST SHE SAID FROM NORHALA WHEN SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND ME IT WHISPERED AND THEN SEEMED TO FLOAT FROM HER AND COVER ME LIKE LIKE A VEIL
MISS CARLYLE WHISKED OUT OF THE ROOM UPON WHAT ERRAND WAS BEST KNOWN TO HERSELF AND IN THE HALL SHE AND MARVEL CAME TO AN ENCOUNTER NO WORDS PASSED BUT EACH EYED THE OTHER GRIMLY MARVEL WAS VERY STYLISH WITH FIVE FLOUNCES TO HER DRESS A VEIL AND A PARASOL
ALL THAT NATURAL CAMOUFLAGE WHICH WAS THE BASIS OF THE ART OF CONCEALMENT SO ASTONISHINGLY DEVELOPED IN THE LATE WAR LIKE THE ANIMALS OF THE WILD THE MIND OF MAN MOVES THROUGH A JUNGLE THE JUNGLE OF LIFE
AND AT THE PAIN IN HIS CRY SHE WINCED WAIT SHE SAID AND HELD UP A LITTLE TREMULOUS HAND YOU ASKED AND NOW YOU MUST LISTEN SHE WAS SILENT AND WHEN ONCE MORE SHE SPOKE HER VOICE WAS LOW CURIOUSLY RHYTHMIC HER EYES RAPT
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BOILING WATER YOU'D NEVER SLEEP A WINK ALL NIGHT MA'AM IF YOU TOOK TEA AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK OH THEN NEVER MIND REPLIED LADY ISABEL IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE DO NOT LET ME GIVE TROUBLE
TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND THAT I WAS HUNGRY AND WITH DEEP RELIEF I WATCHED RUTH PARTAKE OF FOOD AND DRINK EVEN THOUGH LIGHTLY ABOUT HER SEEMED TO HOVER SOMETHING OF THE ETHEREAL ELUSIVE AND DISQUIETING WAS IT THE STRANGELY PELLUCID LIGHT THAT GAVE THE EFFECT I WONDERED
I FANCIED I MIGHT SEE YOU ARE LAUGHING YES HE WAS SMILING FOR HE KNEW THAT THESE MOMENTS OF NERVOUS FEAR ARE BEST MET JESTINGLY HE MADE HER DRINK THE WINE AND WATER AND THEN HE SHOWED HER WHERE THE BELL WAS RINGING IT AS HE DID SO
HAS BEEN TO ME LONG ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PHENOMENA OF OUR PSYCHOLOGY IT IS INSTINCTIVELY A PROTECTIVE HABIT OF COURSE
YOU HERE CORNELIA THAT WAS KIND HOW ARE YOU ISABEL THIS IS MY SISTER LADY ISABEL PUT FORTH HER HAND AND MISS CARLYLE CONDESCENDED TO TOUCH THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS
ITS POSITION HAD BEEN CHANGED IN SOME LATE ALTERATIONS TO THE HOUSE YOUR ROOMS SHALL BE CHANGED TO MORROW ISABEL NO LET US REMAIN IN THESE I SHALL LIKE TO FEEL THAT PAPA WAS ONCE THEIR OCCUPANT I WON'T GET NERVOUS AGAIN
WHEN DRAKE AT LAST BROKE THE SILENCE THAT HAD CLOSED IN UPON THE PASSING OF THAT STILL SMALL VOICE THE ESSENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS OCCURRED TO ME HE STRODE OVER TO THE WEEPING GIRL AND IN HIS VOICE WAS A ROUGHNESS THAT ANGERED ME UNTIL I REALIZED HIS PURPOSE
SHE JERKED OUT MISTER CARLYLE LEFT THEM TOGETHER AND WENT BACK TO SEARCH FOR SOME TRIFLES WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE CARRIAGE MISS CARLYLE LED THE WAY TO A SITTING ROOM WHERE THE SUPPER TRAY WAS LAID
I SLIPPED MY HAND DOWN INTO THE MEDICINE CASE BROUGHT FORTH A CERTAIN POTENT AND TASTELESS COMBINATION OF DRUGS WHICH I CARRY UPON EXPLORATIONS I DROPPED A LITTLE INTO HER CUP THEN HELD IT TO HER LIPS LIKE A CHILD UNTHINKING SHE OBEYED AND DRANK
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE WEDDING MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS WIFE CAME HOME THEY WERE EXPECTED AND MISS CARLYLE WENT THROUGH THE HALL TO RECEIVE THEM AND STOOD ON THE UPPER STEPS BETWEEN THE PILLARS OF THE PORTICO AN ELEGANT CHARIOT WITH FOUR POST HORSES WAS DRAWING UP
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD FIGHT IT OUT MYSELF BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOW IT THERE'S A TAINT UPON ME I CAUGHT IN DRAKE'S SWIFT GLANCE THE ECHO OF MY OWN THRILL OF APPREHENSION FOR HER SANITY YES SHE SAID NOW QUIETLY
AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT IT WAS A QUIETNESS AND PEACE THAT HELD WITHIN IT A HAPPINESS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME UTTERLY TRANQUIL AND UTTERLY FREE I SEEMED TO BE AT THE DOORWAY TO UNKNOWN ECSTASIES AND THE LIFE I HAD KNOWN ONLY A DREAM
THEN LEAVING THAT SENTENCE UNFINISHED WHISPERED AND WHEN IT LIFTED ME IT WAS AS THOUGH I HAD COME AT LAST OUT OF SOME ENDLESS BLACK OCEAN OF DESPAIR INTO THE FULL SUN OF PARADISE RUTH CRIED DRAKE
SOME NEW AND ALIEN THING WITHIN MY HEART MY BRAIN MY SOUL IT CAME TO ME FROM NORHALA WHEN WE RODE THE FLYING BLOCK AND HE SEALED UPON ME WHEN I WAS IN HIS AGAIN SHE CRIMSONED EMBRACE
THE STRIPES SAY OF THE ZEBRA AND TIGER THAT BLEND SO CUNNINGLY WITH THE BARRED AND SPECKLED SHADOWINGS OF BUSH AND JUNGLE THE TWIG AND LEAFLIKE SHAPES AND HUES OF CERTAIN INSECTS IN FACT
BUT I'LL NOT SURRENDER HER EYES WERE TRAGIC NEVER THINK IT I CAN WIN DON'T YOU KNOW I CAN WIN DRAKE DROPPED DOWN BESIDE HER DREW HER TOWARD HIM
MEANWHILE LADY ISABEL SAT DOWN AND BURST INTO BITTER TEARS AND SOBS A CHILL HAD COME OVER HER IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE COMING TO EAST LYNNE MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED AND WITNESSED THE GRIEF ISABEL HE UTTERED IN AMAZEMENT AS HE HASTENED UP TO HER
MISTER CARLYLE SHUT THE DOOR AND THEN LOOKED AT HIS WIFE AND LAUGHED HE IS VERY KIND TO ME THOUGHT ISABEL WITH THE MORNING BEGAN THE PERPLEXITIES OF LADY ISABEL CARLYLE BUT FIRST OF ALL JUST FANCY THE GROUP AT BREAKFAST
I CAME BACK TO THE CHAIR AND COVERED MY HEAD OVER HOPING SOME ONE WOULD COME UP I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CORNELIA BUT WHAT MADE YOU NERVOUS OH I WAS VERY FOOLISH I KEPT THINKING OF FRIGHTFUL THINGS THEY WOULD COME INTO MY MIND DO NOT BLAME ME ARCHIBALD THIS IS THE ROOM PAPA DIED IN
CRIED THE RELIEVED LADY ISABEL I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO IT BUT I MUST LEARN I DON'T THINK I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING MISS CORNY'S ANSWER WAS TO STALK FROM THE ROOM ISABEL ROSE FROM HER CHAIR LIKE A BIRD RELEASED FROM ITS CAGE AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE
MY DARLING WHAT AILS YOU I AM TIRED I THINK SHE GENTLY ANSWERED AND COMING INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN MADE ME THINK OF PAPA I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO MY ROOMS ARCHIBALD BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH THEY ARE NEITHER DID MISTER CARLYLE KNOW BUT MISS CARLYLE CAME WHISKING IN AGAIN AND SAID
THE WONDER OF IT GREW AND GREW I THRILLED WITH IT I REMEMBER NOTHING OF THAT RIDE SAW NOTHING EXCEPT THAT ONCE THROUGH THE PEACE ENFOLDING ME PIERCED WARNING THAT MARTIN WAS IN PERIL AND I BROKE THROUGH TO SEE HIM CLUTCHING NORHALA AND TO SEE FLOATING UP IN HER EYES DEATH FOR HIM

REASSEMBLING ME FITTING ME EVEN CLOSER TO THE ELEMENTAL THINGS CHANGING ME FULLY INTO THEM I FELT THE LITTLE TENDRILS TOUCHING CARESSING THEN CAME THE SHOTS AWAKENING WAS DREADFUL A STRUGGLING BACK FROM DROWNING

HE THOUGHT IT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT HIS SISTER SHE WISHES TO REMAIN WITH US HE SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE ON THE ONE HAND I THINK SHE MIGHT SAVE YOU THE WORRY OF HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT ON THE OTHER I FANCY WE SHALL BE HAPPIER BY OURSELVES
MISS CARLYLE COMPRESSED HER LIPS AS SHE SCANNED IT SHE WAS ATTIRED IN A HANDSOME DARK SILK DRESS AND A NEW CAP HER ANGER HAD HAD TIME TO COOL DOWN IN THE LAST MONTH AND HER STRONG COMMON SENSE TOLD HER THAT THE WISER PLAN WOULD BE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT MISTER CARLYLE CAME UP THE STEPS WITH ISABEL
I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD ANSWERED LADY ISABEL SO MISS CARLYLE PROCEEDED TO HER DUTIES VERY STERN AND GRIM THE MEAL WAS NEARLY OVER WHEN PETER CAME IN AND SAID THE BUTCHER HAD COME UP FOR ORDERS
SHELTERS OF THE FAMILIAR THE HABITUAL THE CUSTOMARY ON THESE ANCESTRAL PATHS WITHIN THESE BARRIERS OF USAGE MAN MOVES HIDDEN AND SECURE AS THE ANIMALS IN THEIR HAUNTS OR SO HE THINKS OUTSIDE THEM LIE THE WILDERNESSES AND THE GARDENS OF THE UNKNOWN
I DARE SAY SHE NEVER GAVE A DOMESTIC ORDER IN HER LIFE THIS WAS A VIEW OF THE CASE TO MISTER CARLYLE SO PLAUSIBLY PUT THAT HE BEGAN TO THINK IT MIGHT BE ALL FOR THE BEST HE HAD GREAT REVERENCE FOR HIS SISTER'S JUDGMENT FORCE OF HABIT IS STRONG UPON ALL OF US

MISS CARLYLE LOOKED AT LADY ISABEL WAITING OF COURSE FOR HER TO GIVE THEM ISABEL WAS SILENT WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HAD NEVER GIVEN SUCH AN ORDER IN HER LIFE TOTALLY IGNORANT WAS SHE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF A HOUSEHOLD AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO SUGGEST A FEW POUNDS OF MEAT OR A WHOLE COW
BUT THEY ARE HOME TO HIM THEREFORE IT IS THAT HE SCURRIES FROM SOME OPEN PLACE OF REVELATION SOME STORM OF EMOTION SOME STRENGTH TESTING STRUGGLE BACK INTO THE SHELTER OF THE OBVIOUS
ALL PASSIONLESS YET RAPTUROUS OUT OF THE THING THAT HELD ME OUT FROM ITS FIRES PULSED VITALITY A FLOOD OF INHUMAN ENERGY IN WHICH I WAS BATHED AND IT WAS AS THOUGH THIS ENERGY WERE
I SPOKE SHARPLY NOW IN MY OWN PERPLEXITY YOU DO KNOW YOU MUST TELL US FOR HIS SAKE I POINTED TOWARD VENTNOR SHE DREW A LONG BREATH YOU'RE RIGHT OF COURSE SHE SAID UNSTEADILY ONLY I
BUT HE HASTILY PUT BACK ONE OF HIS HANDS AND HELD HER TIGHTLY IN HIS PROTECTING GRASP MARVEL WAS COMING ALONG THE CORRIDOR IN ANSWER TO THE RING HAVE THE GOODNESS TO LET MISS CARLYLE KNOW THAT I AM NOT COMING DOWN AGAIN TO NIGHT HE SAID YES SIR
PASSING ALONG PATHS BEATEN OUT BY THE THOUGHT OF HIS COUNTLESS FOREFATHERS IN THEIR PROGRESS FROM BIRTH TO DEATH AND THESE PATHS ARE BORDERED AND SCREENED FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY WITH BUSH AND TREES OF HIS OWN SELECTION SETTING OUT AND CULTIVATION
BREWED TEA OVER THE SPIRIT LAMP WITH WATER FROM THE BUBBLING SPRING IN THESE COMMONPLACES I KNEW THAT SHE AT LEAST WAS FINDING RELIEF FROM THAT STRAIN OF THE ABNORMAL UNDER WHICH WE HAD LABORED SO LONG
AND AS WE GAZED AT HER INCREDULOUSLY A THING THAT URGES ME TO FORGET YOU TWO AND MARTIN AND ALL THE WORLD I'VE KNOWN THAT TRIES TO PULL ME FROM YOU FROM ALL TO DRIFT UNTROUBLED IN SOME VAST CALM FILLED WITH AN ORDERED ECSTASY OF PEACE
SHE HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS QUIVERING IF I COULD SLEEP SHE WAILED BUT I'M AFRAID TO SLEEP I THINK I SHALL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN FOR SLEEPING HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I MAY BE WHEN I WAKE I CAUGHT DRAKE'S EYE HE NODDED
MISS CARLYLE DESCENDED IN THE STARTLING COSTUME THE READER HAS SEEN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND THERE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT MISTER CARLYLE CAME DOWN NEXT AND THEN LADY ISABEL ENTERED IN AN ELEGANT HALF MOURNING DRESS WITH FLOWING BLACK RIBBONS
AT ANY RATE IT CAN BE TRIED FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND WE SHALL SEE HOW IT WORKS HE MUSINGLY OBSERVED THEY REACHED THE PARK GATES I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU AND BE YOUR CLERK SHE CRIED UNWILLING TO RELEASE HIS HAND I SHOULD NOT HAVE ALL THAT LONG WAY TO GO BACK BY MYSELF
IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN ENABLING US TO DETERMINE OUR COURSE I'M GOING TO REPEAT YOUR BROTHER'S QUESTION WHAT DID NORHALA DO TO YOU AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE FLOATING BEFORE THE DISK
WHILE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX WAS A REPRESENTATION OF OLIVER CROMWELL LEANING AGAINST A POST
THE MORNING HEE FELL TO HIS OLD COURS NOTWITHSTANDING THINKING IT WAS BUT A DREAM BUT WHEN HEE CAME TO TAKE HIS PIPE HEE HAD SUCH AN APPREHENSION THAT THE DEVILL DID INDEED STAND BY HIM AND DOE THE OFFICE AS HEE DREAMED THAT HEE WAS STRUCK SPEECHLESS FOR A TIME AND WHEN HEE CAME TO HIMSELF
AS MISTER OLDWIT HIMSELF IN ANOTHER SCENE OF THE SAME PLAY SAYS TO HIS FRIENDS WE'LL INTO MY SMOKING ROOM AND SPORT ABOUT A BRIMMER THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME EXCUSE FOR HIS WIFE'S REMARK
AND THEREFORE PUBLIC HOUSES ARE NUMEROUS HERE AND BUSINESS GOES ON BUT SLOWLY IN THE SHOPS BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE MAKES NO MENTION OF COFFEE HOUSES A LITTLE LATER THEY WERE TOO COMMON AND TOO MUCH FREQUENTED TO BE OVERLOOKED
BUT MORE GENERALLY UPON THE SPUR OR FLAT HEEL OF THE PIPE MANY PIPES DISPLAY ON THE HEELS VARIOUS FORMS OF LINES HATCHED AND MILLED WHICH WERE PERHAPS THE EARLIEST MARKS OF IDENTIFICATION ADOPTED BY THE PIPE MAKERS
AN ENGLISH WRITER ON THRIFT IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX SAID THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR A MECHANIC TRADESMAN TO GO TO THE COFFEE HOUSE OR ALE HOUSE IN THE MORNING TO DRINK HIS MORNING'S DRAUGHT AND THERE HE WOULD SPEND TWOPENCE
ALTHOUGH SMOKING WAS GENERAL AMONG PARSONS YET ATTACKS ON TOBACCO WERE OCCASIONALLY HEARD FROM PULPITS A LANCASHIRE PREACHER NAMED THOMAS JOLLIE WHO WAS ONE OF THE MINISTERS EJECTED FROM CHURCH LIVINGS BY THE ACT OF UNIFORMITY
AND I HAD HIS STEEL BOX WITH THE BARGAIN AND FULL OF SMOAKE
TAKING TOBACCO AND TALKING MUCH BENEATH THE GRAVITY OF JUDGES WHO HAD BUT A DAY OR TWO BEFORE CONDEMNED MISTER ALGERNON SIDNEY
WERE PRESENTED BY COLONISTS IN AMERICA TO THE INDIANS THEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME VALUABLE AS OBJECTS OF BARTER OR PART PURCHASE VALUE IN EXCHANGE FOR LAND IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PIPES AND ONE HUNDRED JEW'S HARPS WERE GIVEN FOR A STRIP OF COUNTRY NEAR TIMBER CREEK
AND IN DESCRIBING HAWSTED PLACE WHICH WAS REBUILT ABOUT FIFTEEN SEVENTY SAYS THAT THERE WAS A SMALL APARTMENT CALLED THE SMOKING ROOM A NAME HE SAYS IT ACQUIRED PROBABLY SOON AFTER IT WAS BUILT
IN A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MONOGRAMS WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAKERS OF CERTAIN PIPES FOUND IN QUANTITIES AT VARIOUS PLACES BY REFERENCE TO THE FREEMAN AND BURGESS ROLLS AND PARISH REGISTERS DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH PIPES
AT LAMBETH PALACE ONE SUNDAY IN FEBRUARY SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO JOHN EACHARD THE AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS BOOK OR TRACT ON THE CONTEMPT OF THE CLERGY SIXTEEN SEVENTY WHICH MACAULAY TURNED TO SUCH ACCOUNT DINED WITH ARCHBISHOP SHELDON
BUT THE PRACTICE CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN COMMON TOBACCO WAS STILL THE SYMBOL OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
TOBACCO IT SELF IS BY FEW TAKEN NOW AS MEDICINAL IT IS GROWN A GOOD FELLOW AND FALLEN FROM A PHYSICIAN TO A COMPLEMENT HE'S NO GOOD FELLOW THAT'S WITHOUT BURNT PIPES TOBACCO AND HIS TINDER BOX
JACOB SMITH IT DOTH BELONG AT THE BLACK LYON IN HIGH HOLBORN DATE AUGUST SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE SMOKERS OF THE PERIOD WERE OFTEN CURIOUS IN TOBACCO BOXES
HOWELL IN ONE OF HIS FAMILIAR LETTERS DATED JANUARY FIRST SIXTEEN FORTY SIX SAYS THAT THE SMOKE OF TOBACCO IS ONE OF THE WHOLESOMEST SENTS THAT IS AGAINST ALL CONTAGIOUS AIRS FOR IT OVERMASTERS ALL OTHER SMELLS
BUTTER CHEESE BREAD CAKES BEERE AND TOBACCO AND TOBACCO PIPES AT THE GOEING OF THE ROUNDS OF THE TOWNE ON THE OCCASION OF A SIMILAR PERAMBULATION OF THE PARISH BOUNDARIES IN SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN
AS A PRESERVATIVE FROM CONTAGION AT TIMES OF PLAGUE HEARNE THE ANTIQUARY WRITING EARLY IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IN THE GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE
DRINK AND SMOAK IF THE RESTORED KING DID NOT HIMSELF SMOKE TOBACCO WAS FAR FROM UNKNOWN AT THE PALACE OF WHITEHALL WE GET A CURIOUS GLIMPSE OF ONE ASPECT OF LIFE THERE IN THE PICTURE WHICH LILLY THE NOTORIOUS ASTROLOGER
WHEN EXCAVATIONS WERE IN PROGRESS EARLY IN NINETEEN O ONE PREPARATORY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF KINGSWAY AND ALDWYCH THEY INCLUDED THE REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM THE BURYING GROUNDS OF SAINT CLEMENT DANES
HAS LEFT A MANUSCRIPT DIARY RELATING TO HIS RELIGIOUS WORK IN IT UNDER DATE SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HE MENTIONS THAT HE HAD SPOKEN AGAINST THE INORDINATE AFFECTION TO AND THE IMMODERATE USE OF TOBACCO WHICH DID CAUS MUCH TROUBLE IN SOME OF MY HEARERS
IN DECEMBER SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR
WITHIN THE LID WAS A PICTURE OF THE RESTORED KING
AND THAT AT A STATED HOUR EACH MORNING LESSONS WERE LAID ASIDE AND MASTERS AND SCHOLARS ALIKE PRODUCED THEIR PIPES AND PROCEEDED TO SMOKE TOBACCO BUT I KNOW OF NO AUTHORITY FOR THIS WIDER STATEMENT IT SEEMS TO HAVE GROWN OUT OF HEARNE'S RECORD OF THE PRACTICE AT ETON
AND ABOUT HIS NECK A HALTER TIED TO THE TREE WHILE BESIDE HIM WAS PICTURED THE DEVIL WIDE MOUTHED ANOTHER FORM OF MEMORIAL TOBACCO BOX IS DESCRIBED IN AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE LONDON GAZETTE OF SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
BUT GOOD AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT SEEMS TO BE LACKING HUTTON IN HIS HISTORY OF DERBY SAYS THAT WHEN THAT TOWN WAS VISITED BY THE PLAGUE IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THAT AT THE HEADLESS CROSS THE MARKET PEOPLE HAVING THEIR MOUTHS PRIMED WITH TOBACCO AS A PRESERVATIVE
WHO COULD NOT FOLLOW HIS CALLING WITHOUT HIS PIPE IN HIS MOUTH BUT THAT TEXT ISAIAH FIFTY FIVE TWO COMING INTO HIS MIND HEE LAYD ASIDE HIS TAKING OF TOBACCO THE OTHER INSTANCE WAS OF A PROFANE PERSON LIVING NIGH HASLINGDON WHO WAS BUT POOR
SOME VERSES IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO WRITTEN BY SAMUEL ROWLANDS IN HIS KNAVE OF CLUBS SIXTEEN ELEVEN TO FEED ON FLESH IS GLUTTONY IT MAKETH MEN FAT LIKE SWINE BUT IS NOT HE A FRUGAL MAN
DECLARED THAT THE ENGLISH WERE NATURALLY LAZY AND SPENT HALF THEIR TIME IN TAKING TOBACCO THEY SMOKED AFTER MEALS HE OBSERVED AND CONVERSED FOR A LONG TIME THERE IS SCARCE A DAY PASSES HE WROTE BUT A TRADESMAN GOES TO THE ALE HOUSE OR TAVERN TO SMOKE WITH SOME OF HIS FRIENDS
TAKE IT WITHOUT ANY MANIFEST INCONVENIENCE IT QUENCHETH THIRST AND YET WILL MAKE ONE MORE ABLE AND FIT TO DRINK IT ABATES HUNGER AND YET WILL GET ONE A GOOD STOMACH IT IS AGREEABLE WITH MIRTH OR SADNESS WITH FEASTING AND WITH FASTING
FOR WHEN ONE TAKES IT EITHER BY CHEWING IT IN THE LEAF OR SMOAKING IT IN THE PIPE
THESE COUNTRY SMOKING ROOMS WERE KNOWN IN LATER DAYS AS STONE PARLOURS THE FLOOR BEING FLAGGED FOR SAFETY'S SAKE AND THE STONE PARLOUR IN MANY A SQUIRE'S HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF MUCH CONVIVIALITY INCLUDING NO DOUBT ABUNDANT SMOKING
AS MANY PERSONS ENGAGE IN THE TRADE WITHOUT LICENCE THE COMPANY'S REQUEST WAS GRANTED
THE REST OF THE VALUE OF THE BOX HE NOTED I FREELY FORGAVE HIM FOR WRITING AT OUR FIRST COMMISSION FOR ME AND FOR COPYING OF ANSWERS AND YE LIKE IN OUR LAW CONCERNS
NEVER USED ANY PRESERVATIVE AGAINST THE INFECTION
AND FROM THENCE RISING UP TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOBACCONIST AS TO THE HELME OF A SUBLIMATORY ARE VOIDED AND SPITTEN OUT WHEN PLAGUE WAS ABROAD EVEN CHILDREN WERE COMPELLED TO SMOKE
AS WELL AS IN LONDON OLD ENGLISH CLAYS SAYS MISTER T P COOPER ARE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AS MOST OF THEM ARE BRANDED WITH THE MAKER'S INITIALS MONOGRAMS AND DESIGNS WERE STAMPED OR MOULDED UPON THE BOWLS AND ON THE STEMS
NEVER HAD THE DISTEMPER AT ALL BUT LIVED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AFTER IT AND WAS SEXTON OF THE PARISH TO THE TIME OF HIS DEATH
YEARS AFTERWARDS DECLARED TO HEARNE THE OXFORD ANTIQUARY THAT HE NEVER WAS WHIPPED SO MUCH IN HIS LIFE AS HE WAS ONE MORNING FOR NOT SMOKING TIMES HAVE CHANGED AT ETON SINCE THIS ANTI TOBACCONIST MARTYR RECEIVED HIS WHIPPING
SO THAT NONE MAY FOLLOW THE TRADE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN APPRENTICES SEVEN YEARS TOBACCO PIPE MAKING WAS A FLOURISHING INDUSTRY AT THIS PERIOD AND THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTEENTH AND FOLLOWING CENTURY IN MOST OF THE CHIEF PROVINCIAL TOWNS AND CITIES
THESE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIPES WERE LARGELY MADE IN HOLLAND OF PIPE CLAY IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND TO THE DISGUST AND LOSS OF ENGLISH PIPE MAKERS IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE THE COMPANY OF TOBACCO PIPE MAKERS
WINSTANLEY WHO WAS AN ENEMY OF WHAT HE CALLED THIS HEATHENISH WEED AND WHO THOUGHT THE FOLLY OF SMOKING MIGHT NEVER HAVE SPREAD SO MUCH IF STRINGENT MEANS OF PREVENTION HAD BEEN EXERCISED YET HAD TO DECLARE IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THAT
WROTE TO MISTER THOMAS CULLUM OF HAWSTED PLACE
MISTER RICHARD STAPLEY GENTLEMAN OF TWINEHAM SUSSEX WHOSE DIARY IS FULL OF CURIOUS INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED IN SIXTEEN NINETY ONE BY HIS FRIEND MISTER JOHN HILL WITH A TOBACCO BOX MADE OF TORTOISE SEVEN YEARS EARLIER STAPLEY HAD SOLD TO HILL
OF SMOAK THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT KING CHARLES SMOKED NOR WHAT HIS PERSONAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS TOBACCO MAY HAVE BEEN HIS MAJESTY WAS PLEASED HOWEVER IN A LETTER TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
PROVE DISPUTANTS IN SCHOOLS IS THAT THEIR FATHERS FED ON FLESH AND THEY BEGAT FAT FOOLS THIS FULSOME FEEDING CLOGGS THE BRAIN AND DOTH THE STOMACH CHOAK BUT HE'S A BRAVE SPARK THAT CAN DINE WITH ONE LIGHT DISH
AND CONSUME AN HOUR IN SMOKING AND TALKING SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS OF THE EVENING IN SIMILAR FASHION COUNTRY GENTLEMEN SMOKED JUST AS MUCH AS TOWN MECHANICS AND TRADESMEN IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT HERVEY AFTERWARDS EARL OF BRISTOL
IT HATH SINGULAR AND CONTRARY EFFECTS IT IS GOOD TO WARM ONE BEING COLD AND WILL COOL ONE BEING HOT ALL AGES ALL SEXES ALL CONSTITUTIONS YOUNG AND OLD MEN AND WOMEN THE SANGUINE THE CHOLERICK THE MELANCHOLY THE PHLEGMATICK
THIS TOO WAS DOUBTLESS VIRGINIAN OR COLONIAL TOBACCO THE NORTH ELMHAM CHURCH ACCOUNTS NORFOLK
HEE THREW HIS TOBACCO IN THE FIRE AND HIS PIPES AT THE WALLS RESOLVING NEVER TO MEDDLE MORE WITH IT SOE MUCH MONEY AS WAS FORMERLY WASTED BY THE WEEK IN TO SERVING HIS FAMILY AFTERWARD WEEKLY
SOME THEREIN WERE SLEEPING OTHERS SWEARING OTHERS SMOAKING TOBACCO IN THE CHIMNEY OF THE ROOM I BELIEVE THERE WAS TWO BUSHELS OF BROKEN TOBACCO PIPES ALMOST HALF ONE LOAD OF ASHES WHAT WOULD THE KING'S GRANDFATHER THE AUTHOR OF THE COUNTERBLASTE HAVE SAID
AND THEIR THREATENED RUIN BECAUSE COOKS BAKERS AND ALE HOUSE KEEPERS AND OTHERS MAKE PIPES BUT SO UNSKILFULLY THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO DISESTEEM THEY REQUEST TO BE COMPREHENDED IN THE STATUTE OF LABOURERS OF FIVE ELIZABETH
SMOKING IN THE RESTORATION PERIOD THE INDIAN WEED WITHERED QUITE GREEN AT NOON CUT DOWN AT NIGHT SHOWS THY DECAY ALL FLESH IS HAY THUS THINK THEN DRINK TOBACCO
BY THOSE WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO BURY THE DEAD THESE PIPES HAVE BEEN DUG UP FROM TIME TO TIME IN NUMBERS SO LARGE THAT ONE ANTIQUARY MISTER H SYER CUMING HAS VENTURED TO INFER THAT ALMOST EVERY PERSON WHO VENTURED FROM HOME INVOKED THE PROTECTION OF TOBACCO
IN NEW JERSEY WILLIAM PENN THE FOUNDER OF PENNSYLVANIA PURCHASED A TRACT OF LAND AND THREE HUNDRED PIPES WERE INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLES GIVEN IN THE EXCHANGE THE FRENCH TRAVELLER SORBIERE WHO VISITED LONDON IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE
AND THE WORDS LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US CHALKED UPON THE DOORS HE FELT SO ILL AT EASE
IT HATH AN OFFENSIVE SMELL TO SOME AND IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN ANY PERFUME TO OTHERS THAT IT IS A MOST EXCELLENT PRESERVATIVE BOTH EXPERIENCE AND REASON DO TEACH IT CORRECTS THE AIR BY FUMIGATION AND IT AVOIDS CORRUPT HUMOURS BY SALIVATION
THEY SOLD MANY THINGS BESIDES COFFEE AND SERVED A VARIETY OF PURPOSES BUT PRIMARILY THEY WERE TEMPLES OF TALK AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP
MAYORAL AND OTHER AND SMOKING WAS MADE A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO A CONTEMPORARY PAMPHLETEER SAYS THAT IN THE SHOW OF THAT YEAR WERE TWO EXTREME GREAT GIANTS EACH OF THEM AT LEAST FIFTEEN FOOT HIGH THAT DO SIT
AND TOOK UP HIS TIME IN THE TRADE OF SMOKING AND ALSO SPENT WHAT SHOULD RELIEV HIS POOR FAMILY THIS MAN DREAMED THAT HE WAS TAKING TOBACCO
OPENED A NEW FIELD FOR THE VICTORIES OF TOBACCO THE FIRST HOUSE WAS OPENED IN SAINT MICHAEL'S ALLEY CORNHILL IN SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO OTHERS SOON FOLLOWED AND IN A SHORT TIME THE NEW BEVERAGE HAD CAPTURED THE TOWN AND COFFEE HOUSES HAD BEEN OPENED IN EVERY DIRECTION
WHO LOVES TO TELL OF HIS EARLY MEETINGS WITH BEN JONSON AND OTHER LITERARY HEROES OF A BYGONE DAY WHILE ALL THE BEAU MONDE AS MY DAUGHTER SAYS ARE WITH US IN THE DRAWING ROOM YOU HAVE NONE BUT ILL BRED WITLESS DRUNKARDS WITH YOU IN YOUR SMOKING ROOM
THAT HAD LONG BEEN ABSENT FROM ENGLISH LIFE THE FOLLOWING SONG IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO TAKEN FROM A COLLECTION WHICH WAS PRINTED IN SIXTEEN SIXTY IS TOUCHED WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME THOUGH IT IS REALLY FOUNDED ON AND TO NO SMALL EXTENT TAKEN FROM
A LATER CULLUM SIR JOHN
AND SOME REFORMATION DID FOLLOW HE THEN GOES ON TO RECORD TWO REMARKABLE EXAMPLES OF SUCH REFORMATION EXAMPLES HE SAYS WHICH DID STIRR ME UP IN THAT CASE MORE THAN ORDINARY THE ONE I HAD FROM MY REVEREND BROTHER MISTER ROBERT WHITTAKER
NONE OF THOSE WHO KEPT TOBACCONISTS SHOPS SUFFERED FROM IT AND THIS BELIEF NO DOUBT ENHANCED THE MEDICAL REPUTATION OF THE WEED I HAVE ALSO SEEN IT STATED THAT DURING THE CHOLERA EPIDEMICS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX NOT ONE LONDON TOBACCONIST DIED FROM THAT DISEASE
AND IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL INDEED WHETHER A SINGLE PARSON PUT HIS PIPE OUT
PETITIONED PARLIAMENT TO FORBID THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PIPE CLAY SINCE BY THE MANUFACTURE OF PIPES IN HOLLAND THEIR TRADE IS MUCH DAMAGED FURTHER THEY ASKED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THEIR CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT SO AS TO EMPOWER THEM TO REGULATE ABUSES
AT THE TIME OF THE DREADFUL VISITATION OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALL THE BOYS AT ETON WERE OBLIGED TO SMOKE IN SCHOOL EVERY MORNING ONE OF THESE JUVENILE SMOKERS A CERTAIN TOM ROGERS
AS LONG AS IT STOOD I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ON WHAT AUTHORITY SIR JOHN CULLUM COULD HAVE MADE THE ASSERTION THAT THE ROOM WAS CALLED THE SMOKING ROOM FROM SO EARLY A DATE AS THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NO MENTION IN PRINT OF A SMOKING ROOM HAS BEEN FOUND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OXFORD DICTIONARY
AND THE SQUIRE THE CHEAPER VIRGINIAN AT THE ANNUAL PARISH FEAST HELD AT SAINT BRIDE'S FLEET STREET LONDON ON MAY TWENTY FOURTH SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX
OFFICIALLY TO CONDEMN SMOKING BY PARSONS AS AT THE SAME TIME HE CONDEMNED THE PRACTICE OF WIG WEARING AND OF SERMON READING BY THE CLERGY BUT THE ROYAL FROWN WAS WITHOUT EFFECT WIGS SOON COVERED NEARLY EVERY CLERICAL HEAD FROM THE BENCH OF BISHOPS DOWNWARDS
AS THE PRICE OF A POUND OF TOBACCO THESE ENTRIES AND MANY OTHERS OF SIMILAR IMPORT
THAT ON A LEAF CAN DINE HE NEEDS NO LINNEN FOR TO FOUL HIS FINGERS ENDS TO WIPE THAT HAS HIS KITCHIN IN A BOX AND ROAST MEAT IN A PIPE THE CAUSE WHEREFORE FEW RICH MEN'S SONS
PAINTS IN HIS STORY OF HIS ARREST IN JANUARY SIXTEEN SIXTY ONE HE WAS TAKEN TO WHITEHALL AT NIGHT AND KEPT IN A LARGE ROOM WITH SOME SIXTY OTHER PRISONERS TILL DAYLIGHT WHEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDROOM WHICH HE SAYS I THOUGHT TO BE HELL
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE THE AFTERWARDS NOTORIOUS JEFFREYS AND OTHER BIGWIGS
IN SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX AND AGAIN IN SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO
BROUGHT THEIR PROVISIONS IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THIS CRUEL AFFLICTION NEVER ATTEMPTED THE PREMISES OF A TOBACCONIST A TANNER OR A SHOEMAKER WHATEVER GROUND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHYLACTIC EFFECT OF SMOKING
THIS WAS A SILVER BOX WHICH HAD EITHER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE BULL'S HEAD TAVERN CHEAPSIDE OR LEFT IN A HACKNEY COACH IT WAS INGRAVED ON THE LID WITH A COAT OF ARMS ET CETERA AND A MEDAL OF CHARLES THE FIRST FASTENED TO THE INSIDE OF THE LID AND ENGRAVED ON THE INSIDE TO
AND ARE DRAWN BY HORSES IN TWO SEVERAL CHARIOTS MOVING TALKING AND TAKING TOBACCO AS THEY RIDE ALONG TO THE GREAT ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT OF ALL THE SPECTATORS AMONG THE GUESTS AT A WEDDING IN LONDON IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY THREE WERE THE LORD MAYOR SHERIFF AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY
WHICH CONSIDERING HIS PROFICIENCY IN THE ARTS OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP IS PERHAPS A LITTLE SURPRISING
BUT I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT A STRANGER SOME OF YOU ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS AND I BELIEVE THERE IS NOT ONE HERE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO JOIN HEARTILY IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AS MISTER IRWINE PAUSED ARTHUR JUMPED UP
WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION SO THAT ADAM'S ENTRANCE PASSED WITHOUT REMARK IT STANDS TO SENSE MISTER CASSON WAS SAYING AS OLD MISTER POYSER
AND IT CERTAINLY WAS THE MOST PICTURESQUE MOMENT IN THE SCENE WHEN MISTER IRWINE GOT UP TO SPEAK AND ALL THE FACES IN THE ROOM WERE TURNED TOWARDS HIM THE SUPERIOR REFINEMENT OF HIS FACE WAS MUCH MORE STRIKING THAN THAT OF ARTHUR'S WHEN SEEN IN COMPARISON WITH THE PEOPLE ROUND THEM
THAT'S A PLACE O TRUST AND THEE'T ABOVE A COMMON WORKMAN NOW AYE SAID ADAM BUT NOBODY KNOWS A WORD ABOUT IT YET I HAVEN'T GIVEN NOTICE TO MISTER BURGE ABOUT LEAVING HIM AND I DON'T LIKE TO TELL ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT BEFORE HE KNOWS FOR HE'LL BE A GOOD BIT HURT I DOUBT
THAT NO ONE'S ATTENTION MIGHT BE DISTURBED FROM THE YOUNG SQUIRE THE HERO OF THE DAY ARTHUR DID NOT VENTURE TO STOP NEAR HETTY BUT MERELY BOWED TO HER AS HE PASSED ALONG THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE FOOLISH CHILD FELT HER HEART SWELLING WITH DISCONTENT FOR
IT HAD BEEN SETTLED VERY DEFINITELY WHAT MISTER POYSER WAS TO DO WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE SHOULD APPEAR AND FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF ABSTRACTION WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DARK PICTURE OPPOSITE
HEREUPON A GLORIOUS SHOUTING A RAPPING A JINGLING A CLATTERING AND A SHOUTING WITH PLENTIFUL DA CAPO PLEASANTER THAN A STRAIN OF SUBLIMEST MUSIC IN THE EARS THAT RECEIVE SUCH A TRIBUTE FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND HIS HANDS BUSY WITH THE LOOSE CASH AND OTHER ARTICLES IN HIS BREECHES POCKETS WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE ENTERED WITH MISTER IRWINE BY HIS SIDE EVERY ONE STOOD UP AND THIS MOMENT OF HOMAGE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO ARTHUR HE LIKED TO FEEL HIS OWN IMPORTANCE
WHY THE SCOTCH TUNES ARE JUST LIKE A SCOLDING NAGGING WOMAN BARTLE WENT ON WITHOUT DEIGNING TO NOTICE MISTER CRAIG'S REMARK THEY GO ON WITH THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER COME TO A REASONABLE END
BUT THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING MY OWN HEALTH DRUNK BY YOU WOULD NOT BE PERFECT IF WE DID NOT DRINK THE HEALTH OF MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAS FILLED THE PLACE OF BOTH PARENTS TO ME
HE COULD NOT GATHER WHAT WAS VEXING HER BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM TO FEEL OTHERWISE THAN THAT SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WORLD AND THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY NOTHING SHOULD EVER VEX HER ANY MORE
AND YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING WHEN THEY GOT UPSTAIRS THE QUESTION WHICH ARTHUR HAD LEFT UNSETTLED AS TO WHO WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND WHO VICE
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MOVED BY THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE VERY NATURALLY FOR HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE WORLD AND IT WAS UNITING TO DO HIM HONOUR BUT HE FELT NO SHYNESS ABOUT SPEAKING NOT BEING TROUBLED WITH SMALL VANITY OR LACK OF WORDS
SHOULD SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE I WASN'T BUTLER FIFTEEN YEAR WITHOUT LEARNING THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS ABOUT DINNER NAY NAY SAID OLD MARTIN I'N GI'EN UP TO MY SON
WHETHER HE SETS A GOOD BIT O WORK GOING AND FINDS THE MONEY OR WHETHER HE DOES THE WORK WITH HIS OWN HANDS THERE'S NO OCCASION FOR ME TO SAY ANY MORE ABOUT WHAT I FEEL TOWARDS HIM I HOPE TO SHOW IT THROUGH THE REST O MY LIFE IN MY ACTIONS
AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD MISTER IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MISTER POYSER WHO
NOW LET US GO ON FOR WE'RE PRETTY NIGH THE LAST I THINK I KNOW WHAT TO DO NEVER FEAR SAID BARTLE MOVING ON THE NEWS WILL BE GOOD SAUCE TO MY DINNER AYE AYE MY BOY YOU'LL GET ON
THERE WERE VARIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT ADAM'S SPEECH SOME OF THE WOMEN WHISPERED THAT HE DIDN'T SHOW HIMSELF THANKFUL ENOUGH AND SEEMED TO SPEAK AS PROUD AS COULD BE
HE THOUGHT THE GENTRY MADE MORE FUSS ABOUT THIS YOUNG CARPENTER THAN WAS NECESSARY THEY MADE NO FUSS ABOUT MISTER CASSON ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT BUTLER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
FOR HE WAS A LITTLE TOO SHY TO JOIN THE POYSER PARTY ON THIS PUBLIC OCCASION OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING TO HETTY'S SIDE WOULD BE SURE TO TURN UP IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ADAM CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THAT FOR HE DISLIKED ANY RISK OF BEING JOKED ABOUT HETTY
AS WE'RE ALL O ONE MIND ABOUT OUR YOUNG SQUIRE WE'VE PRETTY NIGH ALL ON US KNOWN YOU WHEN YOU WAR A LITTLE UN AN WE'VE NIVER KNOWN ANYTHING ON YOU BUT WHAT WAS GOOD AN HONORABLE YOU SPEAK FAIR
PEOPLE IN A HIGH STATION ARE OF COURSE MORE THOUGHT OF AND TALKED ABOUT AND HAVE THEIR VIRTUES MORE PRAISED THAN THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE PASSED IN HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK BUT EVERY SENSIBLE MAN KNOWS HOW NECESSARY THAT HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WELL
HE'D BETTER NOT HA STIRRED A KETTLE O SOUR BROTH THE BUCOLIC MIND DOES NOT READILY APPREHEND THE REFINEMENTS OF GOOD TASTE BUT THE TOAST COULD NOT BE REJECTED AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN DRUNK ARTHUR SAID I THANK YOU BOTH FOR MY GRANDFATHER AND MYSELF
THEY'RE FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO FRIGHTEN THE BIRDS WITH THAT'S TO SAY THE ENGLISH BIRDS FOR THE SCOTCH BIRDS MAY SING SCOTCH FOR WHAT I KNOW GIVE THE LADS A BAGPIPE INSTEAD OF A RATTLE AND I'LL ANSWER FOR IT THE CORN LL BE SAFE
IT HAS LONG BEEN MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS ON THE ESTATE WHICH HAPPEN TO BE VERY VALUABLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK SO HIGHLY OF HIS CHARACTER BUT BECAUSE HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILL WHICH FIT HIM FOR THE PLACE AND I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY GRANDFATHER'S WISH TOO
THE CAPTAIN SENT FOR ME T OFFER IT ME WHEN I WAS SEEING TO THE POLES AND THINGS HERE AND I'VE AGREED TO'T BUT IF ANYBODY ASKS ANY QUESTIONS UPSTAIRS JUST YOU TAKE NO NOTICE AND TURN THE TALK TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I'LL BE OBLIGED TO YOU
THE BIG OUTSPOKEN FEARLESS MAN WAS VERY SHY AND DIFFIDENT AS TO HIS LOVE MAKING WELL MESTER MASSEY SAID ADAM AS BARTLE CAME UP I'M GOING TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH YOU TO DAY THE CAPTAIN'S SENT ME ORDERS
YOU'VE NIVER DINED HERE BEFORE AS I REMEMBER NO MISTER CASSON SAID ADAM IN HIS STRONG VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALONG THE TABLE I'VE NEVER DINED HERE BEFORE BUT I COME BY CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S WISH AND I HOPE IT'S NOT DISAGREEABLE TO ANYBODY HERE
HE LOOKED NEITHER AWKWARD NOR EMBARRASSED BUT STOOD IN HIS USUAL FIRM UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN A LITTLE BACKWARD AND HIS HANDS PERFECTLY STILL IN THAT ROUGH DIGNITY WHICH IS PECULIAR TO INTELLIGENT HONEST WELL BUILT WORKMEN
AND IT IS NOW SETTLED THAT ADAM SHALL MANAGE THE WOODS A CHANGE WHICH I AM SURE WILL BE VERY MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ESTATE AND I HOPE YOU WILL BY AND BY JOIN ME IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AND IN WISHING HIM ALL THE PROSPERITY IN LIFE THAT HE DESERVES
AND BESIDES THAT HE CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE GOOD WILL OF THESE PEOPLE HE WAS FOND OF THINKING THAT THEY HAD A HEARTY SPECIAL REGARD FOR HIM THE PLEASURE HE FELT WAS IN HIS FACE AS HE SAID MY GRANDFATHER AND I HOPE ALL OUR FRIENDS HERE HAVE ENJOYED THEIR DINNER
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING HIS TUTOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE NATURALLY HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING HIM INTIMATELY WHICH CANNOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE ELSE WHO IS PRESENT AND I HAVE SOME PRIDE AS WELL AS PLEASURE IN ASSURING YOU THAT I SHARE YOUR HIGH HOPES CONCERNING HIM
AH SAID BARTLE PAUSING WITH ONE HAND ON HIS BACK THEN THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WIND THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WIND HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANS TO DO WHY YES SAID ADAM
I THANK YOU ALL MY GOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS ARTHUR SAID FOR THE GOOD OPINION OF ME AND THE KIND FEELINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH MISTER POYSER HAS BEEN EXPRESSING ON YOUR BEHALF AND ON HIS OWN AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY HEARTIEST WISH TO DESERVE THEM
PERHAPS THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT EXCEPT MISTER IRWINE WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPROVED ARTHUR'S GRACEFUL MODE OF PROPOSING HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEALTH THE FARMERS THOUGHT THE YOUNG SQUIRE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY HATED THE OLD SQUIRE AND MISSUS POYSER SAID
AND MOTHER ULL BE FINE AND JOYFUL ABOUT IT LET'S GO AND TELL HER ADAM WAS NOT THE ONLY GUEST INVITED TO COME UPSTAIRS ON OTHER GROUNDS THAN THE AMOUNT HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RENT ROLL THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TWO PARISHES WHO DERIVED DIGNITY FROM THEIR FUNCTIONS
THE HEALTH DRINKING WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER AND THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE GREAT CASK OF BIRTHDAY ALE WERE BROUGHT UP ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE BROAD MISTER POYSER AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE HEAD
THOUGHT THAT SO SENSIBLE A MAN AS ADAM MUST BE REFLECTING ON THE SMALL VALUE OF BEAUTY IN A WOMAN WHOSE TEMPER WAS BAD MARY WAS A GOOD GIRL NOT GIVEN TO INDULGE IN EVIL FEELINGS BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT SINCE HETTY HAD A BAD TEMPER IT WAS BETTER ADAM SHOULD KNOW IT
BUT I'VE THE MORE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU CAPTAIN AND TO YOU MISTER IRWINE AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS HERE WHO'VE DRUNK MY HEALTH AND WISHED ME WELL
WHICH CAN BE FORMED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE HAD TIME TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND TO BECOME EASY AGAIN BEFORE MISTER POYSER'S SLOW SPEECH WAS FINISHED AND WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO SPEAK HE WAS QUITE LIGHT HEARTED
FOR I BELIEVE HE'S ONE O THOSE GENTLEMEN AS WISHES TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND TO LEAVE THE WORLD A BIT BETTER THAN HE FOUND IT
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU CAN KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD IF YOU LIKE AND I HOPE YOU'LL NOT LET DROP A WORD TILL IT'S COMMON TALK FOR I'VE PARTICULAR REASONS AGAINST ITS BEING KNOWN TRUST TO ME MY BOY TRUST TO ME
THE NEXT TIME HE WAS ALONE WITH HETTY HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER THAT SHE MUST NOT THINK SERIOUSLY OF HIM OR OF WHAT HAD PASSED IT WAS NECESSARY TO ARTHUR YOU PERCEIVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS MUST BE GOT RID OF BY GOOD INTENTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
AND HE HAS JUST BEEN EXPRESSING A FEELING WHICH I SHARE VERY HEARTILY AND I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY OMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING SO THAT FEELING IS HIS VALUE AND RESPECT FOR ADAM BEDE
I'D BE ASHAMED TO STAND BEFORE YOU HERE IF IT WASNA TRUE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S A MAN'S PLAIN DUTY AND NOTHING TO BE CONCEITED ABOUT AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME AS I'VE NEVER DONE MORE THAN MY DUTY
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CONDUCT THAT POYSER WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IF HE HAD KNOWN IT WHY NO MAN'S CONDUCT WILL BEAR TOO CLOSE AN INSPECTION AND POYSER WAS NOT LIKELY TO KNOW IT AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAD HE DONE
IT IS WELL KNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT THERE IS NO MAN WHOSE WORD CAN BE MORE DEPENDED ON THAN HIS THAT WHATEVER HE UNDERTAKES TO DO HE DOES WELL AND IS AS CAREFUL FOR THE INTERESTS OF THOSE WHO EMPLOY HIM AS FOR HIS OWN
IN THE COURSE OF THINGS WE MAY EXPECT THAT IF I LIVE I SHALL ONE DAY OR OTHER BE YOUR LANDLORD INDEED IT IS ON THE GROUND OF THAT EXPECTATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAS WISHED ME TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY AND TO COME AMONG YOU NOW AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSITION
HE WOULD HAVE STARTED UP TO MAKE ANOTHER IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THE EXTREME IRREGULARITY OF SUCH A COURSE AS IT WAS HE FOUND AN OUTLET FOR HIS FEELING IN DRINKING HIS ALE UNUSUALLY FAST AND SETTING DOWN HIS GLASS WITH A SWING OF HIS ARM AND A DETERMINED RAP
THERE WAS NONE OF THE STRONG ALE HERE OF COURSE BUT WINE AND DESSERT SPARKLING GOOSEBERRY FOR THE YOUNG ONES AND SOME GOOD SHERRY FOR THE MOTHERS
THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE NOISE OF THE TOASTS BUT IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THEM NOT TO SEE YOU AT TABLE HE WALKED ON SPEAKING TO THE MOTHERS AND PATTING THE CHILDREN WHILE MISTER IRWINE SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH STANDING STILL AND NODDING AT A DISTANCE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE FELL UNDER THE IMMEDIATE OBSERVATION OF MISTER CASSON WHO TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF PRECEDENCE HAD NOT HITHERTO NOTICED HIS ENTRANCE MISTER CASSON WE HAVE SEEN CONSIDERED ADAM RATHER LIFTED UP AND PEPPERY LIKE
BUT NEIGHBOURLY KINDNESS IS AMONG THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THE MORE PRECIOUS THE OLDER THEY GET INDEED OUR PLEASANT MEETING TO DAY IS A PROOF THAT WHEN WHAT IS GOOD COMES OF AGE AND IS LIKELY TO LIVE THERE IS REASON FOR REJOICING
NOT MERELY AS ONE OF POWER AND PLEASURE FOR MYSELF BUT AS A MEANS OF BENEFITING MY NEIGHBOURS IT HARDLY BECOMES SO YOUNG A MAN AS I AM TO TALK MUCH ABOUT FARMING TO YOU WHO ARE MOST OF YOU SO MUCH OLDER AND ARE MEN OF EXPERIENCE STILL
WITH HIS HANDS STILL BUSY IN HIS POCKETS BEGAN WITH THE DELIBERATENESS OF A SLOW STRIKING CLOCK CAPTAIN MY NEIGHBOURS HAVE PUT IT UPO ME TO SPEAK FOR EM TO DAY FOR WHERE FOLKS THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE ONE SPOKESMAN'S AS GOOD AS A SCORE
BEING A NEUTRAL IN THE DISPUTE HAD NO INTEREST BUT IN CONCILIATION THE SCHOOLMASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT WHO'S TO SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE MISTER MASSEY WHY THE BROADEST MAN SAID BARTLE AND THEN HE WON'T TAKE UP OTHER FOLKS ROOM
WHO ARE NEVER WONDERING WHAT IS THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WORLD I'M QUITE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE SAID I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING O THIS SORT FOR IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN MY WAGES
AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HETTY HAD BEEN PLAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LOOKED VERY UGLY AND UNAMIABLE AT THAT MOMENT AND NO ONE'S MORAL JUDGMENT UPON HER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST BEGUILED BUT REALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HER PETTISHNESS
ARTHUR'S WAS A MUCH COMMONER BRITISH FACE AND THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS NEW FASHIONED CLOTHES WAS MORE AKIN TO THE YOUNG FARMER'S TASTE IN COSTUME THAN MISTER IRWINE'S POWDER AND THE WELL BRUSHED BUT WELL WORN BLACK WHICH SEEMED TO BE HIS CHOSEN SUIT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS
AND HIS FRIENDS SHOULD DELIGHT TO HONOUR HIM I KNOW ADAM BEDE WELL I KNOW WHAT HE IS AS A WORKMAN AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN AS A SON AND BROTHER AND I AM SAYING THE SIMPLEST TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I RESPECT HIM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT ANY MAN LIVING
FOR LET US DO WHAT WE WILL IT'S ONLY MAKING USE O THE SPERRIT AND THE POWERS THAT HA BEEN GIVEN TO US
WELL SAID MISTER POYSER SUPPOSE WE SAY THE MAN WI THE FOULEST LAND SHALL SIT AT TOP THEN
THAT UD BE POOR THANKS TO YOU TO SAY THAT YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL THESE YEARS AND YET HAVEN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO FIND OUT A GREAT DEAL O THE TRUTH ABOUT ME YOU THINK IF I UNDERTAKE TO DO A BIT O WORK I'LL DO IT WELL BE MY PAY BIG OR LITTLE AND THAT'S TRUE
WHILE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WERE BEING BUZZED ABOUT MINGLED WITH WONDERINGS AS TO WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANT TO DO FOR A BAILIFF AND WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A STEWARD THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD RISEN AND WERE WALKING ROUND TO THE TABLE WHERE THE WIVES AND CHILDREN SAT
AND THE NEXT BROADEST MUST SIT AT BOTTOM THIS HAPPY MODE OF SETTLING THE DISPUTE PRODUCED MUCH LAUGHTER A SMALLER JOKE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR THAT MISTER CASSON HOWEVER DID NOT FEEL IT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY AND SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH UNTIL IT TURNED OUT
ANYBODY UD THINK THE SCOTCH TUNES HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASKING A QUESTION OF SOMEBODY AS DEAF AS OLD TAFT AND HAD NEVER GOT AN ANSWER YET
AN WE'RE JOYFUL WHEN WE LOOK FORRARD TO YOUR BEING OUR LANDLORD FOR WE B'LIEVE YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHT BY EVERYBODY AN ULL MAKE NO MAN'S BREAD BITTER TO HIM IF YOU CAN HELP IT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN AN THAT'S WHAT WE ALL MEAN
BUT A SECOND COUSIN O MINE A DROVIER WAS A RARE HAND AT REMEMBERING THE SCOTCH TUNES HE'D GOT NOTHING ELSE TO THINK ON THE SCOTCH TUNES SAID BARTLE MASSEY CONTEMPTUOUSLY I'VE HEARD ENOUGH O THE SCOTCH TUNES TO LAST ME WHILE I LIVE
BUT NO ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS HAS SO MUCH REASON AS I COME CHARGE YOUR GLASSES AND LET US DRINK TO OUR EXCELLENT RECTOR THREE TIMES THREE THIS TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH ALL THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WAS WANTING TO THE LAST
NAY NAY LAD SAID SETH THY HONOUR'S OUR HONOUR AND IF THEE GET'ST RESPECT THEE'ST WON IT BY THY OWN DESERTS THE FURTHER I SEE THEE ABOVE ME THE BETTER SO LONG AS THEE FEEL'ST LIKE A BROTHER TO ME IT'S BECAUSE O THY BEING APPOINTED OVER THE WOODS AND IT'S NOTHING BUT WHAT'S RIGHT
AND AS TO THIS NEW EMPLOYMENT I'VE TAKEN IN HAND I'LL ONLY SAY THAT I TOOK IT AT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S DESIRE AND THAT I'LL TRY TO FULFIL HIS EXPECTATIONS I'D WISH FOR NO BETTER LOT THAN TO WORK UNDER HIM AND TO KNOW THAT WHILE I WAS GETTING MY OWN BREAD I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIS INT'RESTS
I'VE GOT NO WIFE TO WORM IT OUT OF ME AND THEN RUN OUT AND CACKLE IT IN EVERYBODY'S HEARING IF YOU TRUST A MAN LET HIM BE A BACHELOR LET HIM BE A BACHELOR WELL THEN IT WAS SO FAR SETTLED YESTERDAY THAT I'M TO TAKE THE MANAGEMENT O THE WOODS
PEEH SAID MISTER CRAIG IT'S NOT TO BE NAMED BY SIDE O THE SCOTCH TUNES I'VE NEVER CARED ABOUT SINGING MYSELF I'VE HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO A MAN THAT'S GOT THE NAMES AND THE NATUR O PLANTS IN'S HEAD ISNA LIKELY TO KEEP A HOLLOW PLACE T HOLD TUNES IN
AND I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IN FEELING THAT WHEN A MAN WHOSE DUTY LIES IN THAT SORT OF WORK SHOWS A CHARACTER WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM AN EXAMPLE IN ANY STATION HIS MERIT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS ONE OF THOSE TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE
AND NOW THERE IS ONE MORE THING I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY SHARE MY PLEASURE ABOUT IT AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE YOU WILL I THINK THERE CAN BE NO MAN HERE WHO HAS NOT A RESPECT AND SOME OF YOU I AM SURE HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR MY FRIEND ADAM BEDE
NOT AS I'M A FINDING FAUT WI MY HUSBAND FOR IF HE'S A MAN O FEW WORDS WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL STAND TO I'M SURE I NEVER SAW A PRETTIER PARTY THAN THIS ARTHUR SAID LOOKING ROUND AT THE APPLE CHEEKED CHILDREN MY AUNT AND THE MISS IRWINES WILL COME UP AND SEE YOU PRESENTLY
OH SIR THE MEN ARE MOSTLY SO TONGUE TIED YOU'RE FORCED PARTLY TO GUESS WHAT THEY MEAN AS YOU DO WI THE DUMB CREATURS WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER FOR HIM SAID MISTER IRWINE LAUGHING WELL SIR WHEN I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING I CAN MOSTLY FIND WORDS TO SAY IT IN THANK GOD
MISSUS POYSER WAS AT THE HEAD OF THIS TABLE AND TOTTY WAS NOW SEATED IN HER LAP BENDING HER SMALL NOSE DEEP DOWN INTO A WINE GLASS IN SEARCH OF THE NUTS FLOATING THERE HOW DO YOU DO MISSUS POYSER SAID ARTHUR WEREN'T YOU PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR HUSBAND MAKE SUCH A GOOD SPEECH TO DAY
THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR PERHAPS IN FLIRTATION BUT ANOTHER MAN IN HIS PLACE WOULD HAVE ACTED MUCH WORSE AND NO HARM WOULD COME NO HARM SHOULD COME FOR
WHAT WOMAN WAS EVER SATISFIED WITH APPARENT NEGLECT EVEN WHEN SHE KNOWS IT TO BE THE MASK OF LOVE HETTY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE DAY SHE HAD HAD FOR A LONG WHILE A MOMENT OF CHILL DAYLIGHT AND REALITY CAME ACROSS HER DREAM
BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT WONDER WHEN I SAY THAT AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN THE ONE IN WHOM I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IS MY FRIEND MISTER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE
NAY NAY SAID SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE WE'RE GLAD YE'RE COME WHO'S GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAIN IT AND YE'LL SING US OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY AFTER DINNER WONNA YE SAID MISTER CHOWNE THAT'S A SONG I'M UNCOMMON FOND ON
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF ADAM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD FEELING FOR HIM I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT I KNOW A GOOD FELLOW WHEN I FIND HIM
IT LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE INNOCENT DISTRESS THAN ILL HUMOUR AND THE SEVERE ADAM FELT NO MOVEMENT OF DISAPPROBATION HE ONLY FELT A SORT OF AMUSED PITY AS IF HE HAD SEEN A KITTEN SETTING UP ITS BACK OR A LITTLE BIRD WITH ITS FEATHERS RUFFLED
BUT MISTER MILLS THE BUTLER ASSURED HIM THAT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAD GIVEN PARTICULAR ORDERS ABOUT IT AND WOULD BE VERY ANGRY IF ADAM WAS NOT THERE ADAM NODDED AND WENT UP TO SETH WHO WAS STANDING A FEW YARDS OFF SETH LAD HE SAID
ADAM MINDED THE LESS ABOUT SITTING BY MISTER CASSON BECAUSE THIS POSITION ENABLED HIM TO SEE HETTY WHO WAS NOT FAR OFF HIM AT THE NEXT TABLE HETTY HOWEVER HAD NOT EVEN NOTICED HIS PRESENCE YET
AND FILLING HIS GLASS SAID A BUMPER TO ADAM BEDE AND MAY HE LIVE TO HAVE SONS AS FAITHFUL AND CLEVER AS HIMSELF NO HEARER NOT EVEN BARTLE MASSEY WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THIS TOAST AS MISTER POYSER TOUGH WORK AS HIS FIRST SPEECH HAD BEEN
AND THOUGH WE'VE MAYHAPPEN GOT CONTRAIRY WAYS O THINKING ABOUT A MANY THINGS ONE MAN LAYS DOWN HIS LAND ONE WAY AN ANOTHER ANOTHER AN I'LL NOT TAKE IT UPON ME TO SPEAK TO NO MAN'S FARMING BUT MY OWN THIS I'LL SAY
AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSSESSION OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH WILL MAKE HIM AN EXCELLENT LANDLORD WHEN THE TIME SHALL COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT POSITION AMONG YOU
FOR TOTTY'S EYES WERE TOO BUSY IN STARING AT THE LARGE DISHES TO SEE WHERE THE PLUM PUDDING WAS FOR HER TO RETAIN ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER LEGS HETTY GOT QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AND AT LAST WITH A FROWN AND POUT AND GATHERING TEARS SHE SAID
IN IMPROVING THEIR LAND AND TRYING TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER PRACTICE OF HUSBANDRY IT WILL BE MY WISH TO BE LOOKED ON BY ALL MY DESERVING TENANTS AS THEIR BEST FRIEND AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY AS TO BE ABLE TO RESPECT EVERY MAN ON THE ESTATE AND TO BE RESPECTED BY HIM IN RETURN
THE CAPTAIN HAS SENT TO SAY I'M TO DINE UPSTAIRS HE WISHES IT PARTICULAR MISTER MILLS SAYS SO I SUPPOSE IT UD BE BEHAVING ILL FOR ME NOT TO GO BUT I DON'T LIKE SITTING UP ABOVE THEE AND MOTHER AS IF I WAS BETTER THAN MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD THEE'T NOT TAKE IT UNKIND I HOPE
RATHER THAN FROM THEIR POCKET AND OF THESE BARTLE MASSEY WAS ONE HIS LAME WALK WAS RATHER SLOWER THAN USUAL ON THIS WARM DAY SO ADAM LINGERED BEHIND WHEN THE BELL RANG FOR DINNER THAT HE MIGHT WALK UP WITH HIS OLD FRIEND
ADAM WAS LOOKING AT HETTY AND SAW THE FROWN AND POUT AND THE DARK EYES SEEMING TO GROW LARGER WITH PETTISH HALF GATHERED TEARS QUIET MARY BURGE WHO SAT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HETTY WAS CROSS AND THAT ADAM'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HER
BUT THERE IS A STILL OLDER FRIEND OF MINE THAN ADAM BEDE PRESENT AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT IS MISTER IRWINE I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE MUST DRINK NO OTHER PERSON'S HEALTH UNTIL WE HAVE DRUNK HIS I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL REASON TO LOVE HIM
I HAVE INTERESTED MYSELF A GOOD DEAL IN SUCH MATTERS AND LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS MY OPPORTUNITIES HAVE ALLOWED
DINNER TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
PEOPLE ULL BE WONDERING TO SEE ME THERE AND THEY'LL LIKE ENOUGH BE GUESSING THE REASON AND ASKING QUESTIONS FOR THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK UP AND DOWN ABOUT MY HAVING THE PLACE THIS LAST THREE WEEKS WELL THEE CANST SAY THEE WAST ORDERED TO COME WITHOUT BEING TOLD THE REASON THAT'S THE TRUTH
FOR IT IS THREE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST CAME AMONG YOU AND I SEE SOME TALL FINE LOOKING YOUNG MEN HERE AS WELL AS SOME BLOOMING YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE FAR FROM LOOKING AS PLEASANTLY AT ME WHEN I CHRISTENED THEM AS I AM HAPPY TO SEE THEM LOOKING NOW
FOR HE HAD THE MYSTERIOUS SECRET OF NEVER WEARING A NEW LOOKING COAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME BY A GREAT MANY HE SAID THAT I HAVE HAD TO THANK MY PARISHIONERS FOR GIVING ME TOKENS OF THEIR GOODWILL
BUT THE DINNER WAS GOOD AN IF THERE'S ANYBODY HASNA ENJOYED IT IT MUST BE THE FAULT OF HIS OWN INSIDE AN AS FOR THE RECTOR'S COMPANY IT'S WELL KNOWN AS THAT'S WELCOME T ALL THE PARISH WHEREVER HE MAY BE AN I HOPE
OH DEAR AUNT I WISH YOU'D SPEAK TO TOTTY SHE KEEPS PUTTING HER LEGS UP SO AND MESSING MY FROCK WHAT'S THE MATTER WI THE CHILD SHE CAN NIVER PLEASE YOU SAID THE MOTHER
AND PRESENTLY WHEN TOTTY WAS GONE SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HER FACE BROKE INTO ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST SMILES AS SHE NODDED TO HIM
ARTHUR HAD FELT A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE DURING MISTER POYSER'S SPEECH BUT IT WAS TOO FEEBLE TO NULLIFY THE PLEASURE HE FELT IN BEING PRAISED DID HE NOT DESERVE WHAT WAS SAID OF HIM ON THE WHOLE
AN WE ALL HOPE AS HE'LL LIVE TO SEE US OLD FOLKS AN OUR CHILDREN GROWN TO MEN AN WOMEN AN YOUR HONOUR A FAMILY MAN I'VE NO MORE TO SAY AS CONCERNS THE PRESENT TIME AN SO WE'LL DRINK OUR YOUNG SQUIRE'S HEALTH THREE TIMES THREE
FOR SHE WAS GIVING ANGRY ATTENTION TO TOTTY WHO INSISTED ON DRAWING UP HER FEET ON TO THE BENCH IN ANTIQUE FASHION AND THEREBY THREATENED TO MAKE DUSTY MARKS ON HETTY'S PINK AND WHITE FROCK NO SOONER WERE THE LITTLE FAT LEGS PUSHED DOWN THAN UP THEY CAME AGAIN
IF JONATHAN BURGE AND A FEW OTHERS FELT LESS COMFORTABLE ON THE OCCASION THEY TRIED THEIR BEST TO LOOK CONTENTED AND SO THE TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH A GOODWILL APPARENTLY UNANIMOUS ADAM WAS RATHER PALER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GOT UP TO THANK HIS FRIENDS
FOR OFTENTIME SHE HAD HICCOUGHS WHILE THIS GOOD MAID WAS IN THE OVEN BY SIDE OF BACK KITCHEN FIREPLACE WITH A FAGGOT OF WOOD DRAWN OVER HER AND LYING SO THAT HER OWN HEART BEAT WORSE THAN IF SHE WERE BAKING THE MEN AS I SAID BEFORE
THROWING OUT A HEAT WHICH WAS UNSUPPORTABLE BY SPECTATORS THE FIREMAN REMAINED SO LONG INVISIBLE THAT SERIOUS DOUBTS WERE ENTERTAINED OF HIS SAFETY HE AT LENGTH HOWEVER ISSUED FROM THE FIERY GULF UNINJURED
COOLING WATER AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DEGREES
INFLAMED STRAW WITH IT AND BROUGHT IT BACK AGAIN TO THE FURNACE ON OTHER OCCASIONS THE FIREMAN HANDLED BLAZING WOOD AND BURNING SUBSTANCES AND WALKED DURING FIVE MINUTES UPON AN IRON GRATING PLACED OVER FLAMING FAGOTS
ALSO I TOLD THEM THAT VERY LIKELY THERE HAD BEEN A RIDD IN THE BATTLE FOUGHT NOT VERY FAR FROM PLOVER'S BARROWS BY THE EARL OF DEVON AGAINST THE DANES WHEN HUBBA THEIR CHIEF WAS KILLED AND THE SACRED STANDARD TAKEN
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE REAL GENTRY FOR A LONG TIME TREATED MY NEW HONOURS WITH CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE BUT GRADUALLY AS THEY FOUND THAT I WAS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO CLAIM ANY EQUALITY WITH THEM BUT WENT ABOUT MY FARM WORK AND THREW ANOTHER MAN AT WRESTLING
A FAMILIAR INSTANCE OF THIS OCCURRED IN THE HEATED ROOM ALL THE PIECES OF METAL THERE EVEN THEIR WATCH CHAINS FELT SO HOT THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY BEAR TO TOUCH THEM FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE AIR FROM WHICH THE METAL HAD DERIVED ALL ITS HEAT WAS ONLY UNPLEASANT
WHO HAS TRAVELLED THROUGH ALL EUROPE TO PRESENT THIS VALUABLE GIFT TO HIS SPECIES SIR H DAVY HAD LONG AGO SHOWN THAT A SAFETY LAMP FOR ILLUMINATING MINES CONTAINING INFLAMMABLE AIR MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED OF WIRE GAUZE ALONE
HE THEN SQUEEZED THE FINGERS OF HIS HORNY HAND CLOSE TOGETHER PUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES UNDER HIS ARMPIT TO MAKE IT SWEAT AS HE SAID AND TAKING IT AGAIN OUT DREW IT OVER A LADLE FILLED WITH MELTED COPPER SOME OF WHICH HE SKIMMED OFF
IS IT LIKELY THAT I WOULD HAVE DWELLED SO LONG UPON MY COAT OF ARMS BUT FOR SOME GOOD REASON AND THIS GOOD REASON IS THAT LORNA TOOK THE GREATEST PRIDE IN IT AND THOUGHT OR AT ANY RATE SAID THAT IT QUITE THREW INTO THE SHADE AND ECLIPSED ALL HER OWN ANCIENT GLORIES
AND EVEN TO HIS FRIENDS AMONG WHOM I WAS RECKONED MALIGNANT EARL BRANDIR WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH ME NOT ONLY FOR HAVING SAVED HIS LIFE BUT FOR SAVING THAT WHICH HE VALUED MORE THE WEALTH LAID BY FOR LORD ALAN
SO AS TO ENABLE FIREMEN TO CARRY ON THEIR OPERATIONS WITH SAFETY HIS EXPERIMENT IS STATED TO HAVE GIVEN SATISFACTION THE POMPIERS WERE CLOTHED IN ASBESTOS OVER WHICH WAS A NETWORK OF IRON
THEREFORE HIS WIFE WAS NOT SURPRISED ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WAS FALLING THAT FARMER CHRISTOPHER SHOULD BE AT WORK IN BLIND MAN'S HOLIDAY AS WE CALL IT BUT SHE WAS SURPRISED NAY ASTONISHED WHEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE BRIGHTENED UP FOR HER HUSBAND
AND FIVE FEET THREE INCHES WIDE WHICH IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE ANCIENT PIECE AND POSSESSES SUPERIOR QUALITIES IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING BEEN WOVEN WITHOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IN THIS MANUFACTURE THE FIBERS ARE PREVENTED FROM BREAKING BY ACTION OF STEAM
ONE OF THE FIREMEN CARRIED ON HIS BACK A CHILD EIGHT YEARS OLD IN A WICKER BASKET COVERED WITH METALLIC GAUZE AND THE CHILD HAD NO OTHER DRESS THAN A CAP MADE OF AMIANTHINE CLOTH IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
AND HALF IN FUN AND HALF IN EARNEST SHE CALLED ME SIR JOHN SO CONTINUALLY THAT AT LAST I WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HER UNTIL HER EYES WERE BEDEWED WITH TEARS AND THEN I WAS ANGRY WITH MYSELF BEGINNING TO BE SHORT OF MONEY
WHEN IT IS RAISED TO ITS HIGHEST TEMPERATURE WITH THE DOORS CLOSED THE THERMOMETER STANDS AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES AND THE IRON FLOOR IS RED HOT THE WORKMEN OFTEN ENTER IT AT A TEMPERATURE OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY DEGREES WALKING OVER THE IRON FLOOR WITH WOODEN CLOGS
A FIRE OF SHAVINGS WAS THEN LIGHTED AND KEPT BURNING IN A LARGE RAISED CHAFING DISH THE FIREMAN PLUNGED HIS HEAD INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES WITH HIS FACE TO THE FUEL AND IN THAT POSITION WENT SEVERAL TIMES ROUND THE CHAFING DISH FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN A MINUTE
SAW THE SAME STUNT PERFORMED BY WORKMEN AT THE MERIDAN BRITTANIA COMPANY'S PLANT THEY TOLD HIM THAT IF THE HAND HAD BEEN WET IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY SCALDED
DECLINED IN THE MOST DECIDED MANNER TO PAY A FARTHING TOWARDS IT AND AS I HAD NOW NO MONEY LEFT THE HERALDS BECAME AS BLUE AS AZURE AND AS RED AS GULES UNTIL HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN CAME FORWARD VERY KINDLY AND SAID THAT IF HIS MAJESTY GAVE ME A COAT OF ARMS
WHICH HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING COULD EQUAL NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD COME TO BE NURSED AS REGULAR AS A CLOCK ALMOST AND INASMUCH AS HE WAS THE FIRST BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER MADE MUCH OF HIM FOR GOD ONLY KNEW WHETHER THEY COULD EVER COMPASS SUCH ANOTHER ONE
WATER DROPPED ON IT FROM A MEDICINE DROPPER WILL BOIL
THUS FAR OUR INTEREST IN HEAT RESISTANCE HAS UNCOVERED SECRETS OF NO VERY GREAT PRACTICAL VALUE HOWEVER ENTERTAINING THE USES TO WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THEM PUT BUT NOT ALL THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAS BEEN DICTATED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF CURIOSITY AND ENTERTAINMENT
THIS I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO DO BECAUSE IT SAVED SO MUCH TROUBLE AND I HAD NO MONEY TO SPEND WITH HIM BUT STILL HE REQUESTED THE USE OF MY NAME AND I BEGGED HIM TO DO THE BEST WITH IT AS I NEVER HAD KEPT A BANKER
AND REMAINED EIGHT MINUTES IN THIS SITUATION FREQUENTLY WALKING ABOUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM BUT STANDING STILL MOST OF THE TIME IN THE COOLEST SPOT
SOME OF THEM IT WAS STATED WHO WORE DOUBLE GLOVES OF AMIANTHUS HELD A RED HOT BAR DURING FOUR MINUTES
WHY THE HAND MAY BE DIPPED IN MOLTEN METALS
NOW THESE TWO MAIDENS WERE KNOWN BECAUSE THEY HAD SERVED THE BEER AT AN ALE HOUSE AND MANY MEN WHO HAD LOOKED AT THEM OVER A PINT OR QUART VESSEL ESPECIALLY AS THEY WERE COMELY GIRLS
BEFORE THE HEAT BECAME INCONVENIENT A FIREMAN HAVING HIS HAND WITHIN A DOUBLE ASBESTOS GLOVE AND ITS PALM PROTECTED BY A PIECE OF ASBESTOS CLOTH SEIZED WITH IMPUNITY A LARGE PIECE OF RED HOT IRON
IN THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH WERE MADE AT PARIS IN THE PRESENCE OF A COMMITTEE OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TWO PARALLEL ROWS OF STRAW AND BRUSHWOOD SUPPORTED BY IRON WIRES WERE FORMED AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM EACH OTHER AND EXTENDED THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
AND HERE LET ME MENTION ALTHOUGH THE TWO ARE QUITE DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT
FOR HE COULD RUN SAY TWO YARDS ALONE AND PERHAPS FOUR OR FIVE BY HOLDING TO HANDLES AND HE HAD A WAY OF LOOKING ROUND AND SPREADING HIS LEGS AND LAUGHING WITH HIS BRAVE LITTLE BODY WELL FETCHED UP AFTER A DESPERATE JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE TABLE
THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL I WAS A LITTLE OLDER AND MORE AWARE OF MY OWN VALUE NOW THIS REMINDS ME HOW IT IS THAT AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IS SO FAR IN FRONT OF FOREIGN NOBLEMEN AND PRINCES I HAVE SEEN AT TIMES A LITTLE BOTH OF ONE AND OF THE OTHER
NOW WHILE I WAS WALKING DAILY IN AND OUT GREAT CROWDS OF MEN FEW OF WHOM HAD ANY FREEDOM FROM THE CARES OF MONEY AND MANY OF WHOM WERE EVEN MORBID WITH A WORSE PEST CALLED POLITICS I COULD NOT BE QUIT OF THINKING HOW WE JOSTLE ONE ANOTHER
NOW THE MARK OF THE FLOOR WAS UPON HIS HEAD AS THE MAID WHO HAD STOLEN TO LOOK AT HIM WHEN THE ROUGH MEN WERE SWEARING UPSTAIRS GAVE EVIDENCE AND SHE PUT A DISH CLOTH UNDER HIS HEAD AND KISSED HIM AND RAN AWAY AGAIN
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IF IT IS NOT TOO HOT THE WATER WILL SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE AND EVAPORATE BUT IF IT IS TOO HOT THE WATER WILL GLANCE OFF WITHOUT WETTING THE IRON AND IF THIS DROP BE ALLOWED TO FALL ON THE HAND IT WILL BE FOUND THAT IT IS STILL COOL
WHILE ALL THE TIME THERE WAS NOTHING WHATEVER EXCEPT MY OWN LOVE OF ADVENTURE AND SPORT TO KEEP ME FROM COMING HOME AGAIN BUT I KNEW THAT MY COAT OF ARMS AND TITLE WOULD TURN EVERY BIT OF THIS GRUMBLING INTO FINE ADMIRATION
THE HEAD DRESS IS A LARGE CAP WHICH ENVELOPS THE WHOLE HEAD DOWN TO THE NECK HAVING SUITABLE PERFORATIONS FOR THE EYES NOSE AND MOUTH THE STOCKINGS AND CAP ARE SINGLE BUT THE GLOVES ARE MADE OF DOUBLE AMIANTHUS CLOTH
WHICH PREVENTED THE FLAME WITHIN HOWEVER LARGE OR INTENSE FROM SETTING FIRE TO THE INFLAMMABLE AIR WITHOUT THIS VALUABLE PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN LONG IN PRACTICAL USE HE ASCRIBED TO THE CONDUCTING AND RADIATING POWER OF THE WIRE GAUZE WHICH CARRIED OFF THE HEAT OF THE FLAME
HENCE THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE HUMAN BODY POSSESSES THE POWER OF DESTROYING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT WHEN COMMUNICATED WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF QUICKNESS THIS POWER HOWEVER VARIES GREATLY IN DIFFERENT MEDIA
A PLOVER BEING A WILD BIRD JUST THE SAME AS A RAVEN IS UPON THIS CHAIN OF REASONING AND WITHOUT ANY WEAK MISGIVINGS
THEN LET US HAVE A GAME OF LORIOT WITH THE BABY IT WILL BE THE BEST THING THAT COULD BEFALL A LUSTY INFANT HERETIC RIDE A COCK HORSE TO BANBURY CROSS BYE BYE BABY BUNTING TOSS HIM UP AND LET ME SEE IF MY WRIST BE STEADY
BUT AFTER THAT TIME HE FELT AN OPPRESSION IN HIS LUNGS WITH A SENSE OF ANXIETY WHICH INDUCED HIM TO LEAVE THE ROOM HIS PULSE WAS THEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOUBLE ITS ORDINARY QUICKNESS
AND AS THEY HAD NOTICED THAT THE EFFECT OF THE HOT AIR WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY PUTTING IT IN MOTION THEY BLEW UPON THE STEAK WITH A PAIR OF BELLOWS AND THUS HASTENED THE DRESSING OF IT TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE GREATEST PORTION OF IT WAS FOUND TO BE PRETTY WELL DONE IN THIRTEEN MINUTES
AND WHEN ALL THE LONDON FOLK THEMSELVES ARE ASKING ABOUT WHITE FROST FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD THEN I SAY SUCH A YEARNING SEIZED ME FOR MOORY CRAG AND FOR DEWY BLADE AND EVEN THE GRUNTING OF OUR SHEEP WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
OR EVEN INTO MELTED COPPER THE MOISTURE OF THE SKIN SUPPLYING A VAPOR WHICH PREVENTS DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE MOLTEN METAL NO MORE THAN AN ENDURABLE DEGREE OF HEAT REACHES THE HAND WHILE THE MOISTURE LASTS
AND MOVED HIS HAND BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS VERY QUICKLY BY WAY OF OSTENTATION WHILE I WAS VIEWING THIS PERFORMANCE I REMARKED A SMELL LIKE THAT OF SINGED HORN OR LEATHER THOUGH HIS HAND WAS NOT BURNT
IF THIS WERE ALL THE STYLE OF IT THEN HAVING KNOWN HIM A LUSTY MAN AND A FINE SINGER IN AN ALE HOUSE
HE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN TO HAVE DONE HIS BEST BEING IN SIGHT OF HEARTH AND HOME
AND GOOD LEGS ARE AN ARGUMENT FOR GOOD ARMS AND SUPPOSING A MAN OF THIS SORT TO HAVE DONE HIS UTMOST AS THE MANNER OF THE RIDDS IS IT WAS NEXT TO CERTAIN THAT HE HIMSELF MUST HAVE CAPTURED THE STANDARD MOREOVER THE NAME OF OUR FARM WAS PURE PROOF
AND THEMSELVES AS WELL IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEY DID WHAT NEARLY ALL ENGLISHMEN DO WHEN A THING IS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT DENY BUT THAT THERE WAS REASON IN MY VIEW OF THE MATTER AND ALTHOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MUST BE THE LOSERS WHICH WAS A HANDSOME THING TO SAY
THE NATURAL MOISTURE OF THE HAND IS USUALLY SUFFICIENT FOR THIS RESULT BUT IT IS BETTER TO WIPE THE HAND WITH A DAMP TOWEL IN DAVID A WELLS THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN NEW YORK EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN
THE FACT IS THAT THE WATER NEVER TOUCHES THE HOT IRON AT ALL PROVIDED THE HEAT IS SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE BUT ASSUMES A SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL SHAPE AND IS SUPPORTED BY A CUSHION OF VAPOR
SINCE THE VAPOR IS SO RAPIDLY EVAPORATED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE DROP THAT IT FORMS THE CUSHION JUST MENTIONED BY A CAREFUL MANIPULATION OF THE DROPPER THE DISK MAY BE FILLED WITH WATER WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTENSE HEAT NEVER REACHES THE BOILING POINT
THE SAME PERSON WHO EXPERIENCED NO INCONVENIENCE FROM AIR HEATED TO TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DEGREES COULD JUST BEAR RECTIFIED SPIRITS OF WINE AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES
NOW I THINK THAT WHEN WE HEARD THIS STORY AND POOR KIT BADCOCK CAME ALL AROUND IN A SORT OF HALF CRAZY MANNER NOT LOOKING UP AT ANY ONE BUT DROPPING HIS EYES AND ASKING WHETHER WE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN WELL TREATED AND SEEMING VOID OF REGARD FOR LIFE
HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE NOBLER PURPOSE OF SAVING HUMAN LIFE AND RESCUING PROPERTY FROM THE FLAMES
GOD HAS MADE THE EARTH QUITE LARGE WITH A SPREAD OF LAND LARGE ENOUGH FOR ALL TO LIVE ON WITHOUT FIGHTING ALSO A MIGHTY SPREAD OF WATER LAYING HANDS ON SAND AND CLIFF WITH A SOLEMN VOICE IN STORM TIME
AND TWO HOGSHEADS AND A HALF OF CIDER AND A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF CANDLES NOT TO MENTION OTHER THINGS OF ALMOST EVERY VARIETY WHICH THEY GOT BY INSISTING UPON IT SURELY THESE MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PLACE WITH NO OUTBURST OF WANTONNESS
CHRISTOPHER BADCOCK WAS A TENANT FARMER IN THE PARISH OF MARTINHOE RENTING SOME FIFTY ACRES OF LAND WITH A RIGHT OF COMMON ATTACHED TO THEM AND AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME BEING NOW THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY AND FINE OPEN WEATHER HE WAS HARD AT WORK PLOUGHING AND PREPARING FOR SPRING CORN
THE AIR THOUGH VERY HOT GAVE NO PAIN AND SIR CHARLES AND ALL THE OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE OF OPINION THAT THEY COULD SUPPORT A MUCH GREATER HEAT
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS NOT SO THEY HAD MADE COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING TOO MUCH EWE MUTTON I THINK IT WAS AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE PLEDGES GIVEN THEY HAD RIDDEN FORTH AND CARRIED AWAY TWO MAIDENS OF OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
THEY PLACED SOME EGGS AND A BEEF STEAK UPON A TIN FRAME NEAR THE THERMOMETER BUT MORE DISTANT FROM THE FURNACE THAN FROM THE WALL OF THE ROOM
AND THE NEXT THING WHICH I MENTIONED POSSESSING ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY TO WIT THAT A PIG WITH TWO HEADS HAD BEEN BORN UPON OUR FARM NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGONE ALTHOUGH HE DIED WITHIN A WEEK MY THIRD QUARTER WAS MADE AT ONCE BY A TWO HEADED BOAR WITH NOBLE TUSKS
THE WORKMEN AT THE SWEDISH MELTING HOUSE SHOWED THE SAME THING TO SOME TRAVELLERS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOR REGNARD SAW IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THE COPPER WORKS IN LAPLAND
AND TELLING THE OTHERS TO SACK THE HOUSE RODE OFF WITH THEIR PRIZE TO THE VALLEY AND FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THOSE TWO WHO CARRIED OFF THE POOR WOMAN I KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT IT WAS CARVER DOONE HIMSELF THE OTHER DOONES BEING LEFT BEHIND AND GRIEVED PERHAPS IN SOME RESPECTS
WHICH ARE OF COURSE CHARRED ON THE SURFACE ON ONE OCCASION SIR F CHANTREY ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE OR SIX OF HIS FRIENDS ENTERED THE FURNACE AND AFTER REMAINING TWO MINUTES THEY BROUGHT OUT A THERMOMETER WHICH STOOD AT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES
AS LONG AGO AS EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE FOR INSTANCE AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER PRINTED THE FOLLOWING PROOF AGAINST FIRE ON TUESDAY WEEK AN EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN PRESENCE OF A COMMITTEE OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS
THAT NOTHING BUT THE NEW WISPS OF SAMSON COULD HAVE HELD ME IN LONDON TOWN LORNA WAS MOVED WITH EQUAL LONGING TOWARDS THE COUNTRY AND COUNTRY WAYS AND SHE SPOKE QUITE AS MUCH OF THE GLISTENING DEW AS SHE DID OF THE SMELL OF OUR OVEN
AND SIR JOSEPH ENTERED WHEN THE HEAT WAS TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DEGREES THOUGH EXPOSED TO SUCH AN ELEVATED TEMPERATURE THEIR BODIES PRESERVED THEIR NATURAL DEGREE OF HEAT WHENEVER THEY BREATHED UPON A THERMOMETER IT SUNK SEVERAL DEGREES
AS SOME OF THE DANES ARE SAID TO BE BURIED EVEN UPON LAND OF OURS AND WE CALL THEIR GRAVES IF SUCH THEY BE EVEN TO THIS DAY BARROWS THE HERALDS QUITE AGREED WITH ME THAT A RIDD MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE OR THEREABOUTS AND IF HE WAS THERE
AND PROUD OF HAVING SUCCEEDED IN BRAVING SO GREAT A DANGER IT IS A REMARKABLE RESULT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE FIREMEN ARE ABLE TO BREATHE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES
IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKE RESPECTING THE DEGREE OF HEAT INDICATED BY THE THERMOMETER AND THAT THE AIR WHICH THEY BREATHED WAS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ALL THE WELL KNOWN EFFECTS OF SUCH A HEAT ON INANIMATE MATTER
AT THIS MOMENT SIX FIREMEN CLOTHED IN THE INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES AND MARCHING AT A SLOW PACE BEHIND EACH OTHER REPEATEDLY PASSED THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH BETWEEN THE TWO ROWS OF FLAME WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY FED WITH ADDITIONAL COMBUSTIBLES
IN A SUBSEQUENT TRIAL AT PARIS A FIREMAN PLACED HIS HEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE BRAZIER FILLED WITH FLAMING HAY AND WOOD AND RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE FIRE DURING FIVE OR SIX MINUTES AND EVEN TEN MINUTES
THE INCOMBUSTIBLE PIECES OF DRESS WHICH HE USES FOR THE BODY ARMS AND LEGS ARE FORMED OUT OF STRONG CLOTH WHICH HAS BEEN STEEPED IN A SOLUTION OF ALUM WHILE THOSE FOR THE HEAD HANDS AND FEET ARE MADE OF CLOTH OF ASBESTOS OR AMIANTHUS
IF INSTEAD OF A FLAT IRON WE USE A CONCAVE METAL DISK ABOUT THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF A WATCH CRYSTAL SOME VERY INTERESTING RESULTS MAY BE OBTAINED IF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DISK IS AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE BOILING POINT
AND SHE MEANT WHAT WAS RIGHT BY HER MASTER AND MISTRESS BUT COULD NOT HELP BEING FRIGHTENED AND MANY WOMEN HAVE BLAMED HER AS I THINK UNDULY FOR HER MODE OF FORSAKING BABY SO IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN BABY INSTINCT RATHER THAN REASON MIGHT HAVE HAD THE DAY WITH HER
SHE SAW SIX OR SEVEN GREAT ARMED MEN BURST INTO THE ROOM UPON HER AND SHE SCREAMED SO THAT THE MAID IN THE BACK KITCHEN HEARD HER BUT WAS AFRAID TO COME TO HELP TWO OF THE STRONGEST AND FIERCEST MEN AT ONCE SEIZED POOR YOUNG MARGERY AND THOUGH SHE FOUGHT FOR HER CHILD AND HOME
WHETHER HIGH OR LOW BUT NEVER FOUND ELSEWHERE THE DEW IS SO CRISP AND PURE AND PEARLY AND IN SUCH ABUNDANCE AND THE BREAD IS SO SWEET SO KIND AND HOMELY YOU CAN EAT A LOAF AND THEN ANOTHER
AND SO IT FELL OUT TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN EVEN I DESIRED FOR ALL THE PARISHES ROUND ABOUT UNITED IN A SUMPTUOUS DINNER AT THE MOTHER MELLDRUM INN FOR NOW THAT GOOD LADY WAS DEAD AND HER NAME AND FACE SET ON A SIGN POST TO WHICH I WAS INVITED
SHE WAS BUT AN INFANT HERSELF IN THEIR HANDS IN SPITE OF TEARS AND SHRIEKS AND STRUGGLES THEY TORE THE BABE FROM THE MOTHER'S ARMS AND CAST IT ON THE LIME ASH FLOOR THEN THEY BORE HER AWAY TO THEIR HORSES FOR BY THIS TIME SHE WAS SENSELESS
FETCH DOWN THE STAVES OF THE RACK MY BOY WHAT WAS FARMER TO HAVE FOR SUPPER NAUGHT BUT AN ONION OR TWO AND A LOAF AND A RASHER OF RUSTY BACON THESE POOR DEVILS LIVE SO BADLY THEY ARE NOT WORTH ROBBING NO GAME
WITH THE RASP OF WINTER BRISTLES RISING THROUGH AND AMONG THE SOFT SUMMER COAT AND WHEN THE NEW STRAW BEGAN TO COME IN GOLDEN WITH THE HARVEST GLOSS AND SMELLING MOST DIVINELY AT THOSE STRANGE LIVERY STABLES WHERE THE NAGS ARE PUT QUITE TAIL TO TAIL
EVEN MERCURY CAN BE FROZEN IN THIS WAY BY A COMBINATION OF CHEMICALS THROUGH THE ACTION OF THIS PRINCIPLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIP THE HAND FOR A SHORT TIME INTO MELTED LEAD
BEFORE WE HAD FINISHED MEDITATING UPON THIS LOOSE OUTRAGE FOR SO I AT LEAST WOULD CALL IT THOUGH PEOPLE ACCUSTOMED TO THE LAW MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF IT WE HAD NEWS OF A THING FAR WORSE WHICH TURNED THE HEARTS OF OUR WOMEN SICK
WHEN THIS COMBUSTIBLE MASS WAS SET ON FIRE
PRAYING MY COMMENDATION DEMANDED OF ME ONE THING ONLY TO SPEAK OF HIM AS I FOUND HIM AS I HAD FOUND HIM MANY A SUNDAY FURBISHING UP OLD FURS FOR NEW WITH A GLAZE TO CONCEAL THE MOTHS RAVAGES
THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS ABOVE DESCRIBED VENTURED TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO STILL HIGHER TEMPERATURES SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN WENT INTO A ROOM WHERE THE HEAT WAS ONE DEGREE OR TWO DEGREES ABOVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES
SABLE UPON SILVER ALL THIS WAS VERY FIERCE AND FINE AND SO I PRESSED FOR A PEACEFUL CORNER IN THE LOWER DEXTER AND OBTAINED A WHEAT SHEAF SET UPRIGHT GOLD UPON A FIELD OF GREEN HERE I WAS INCLINED TO PAUSE AND ADMIRE THE EFFECT
WHEN IN THAT STATE OR NINETEEN DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER SO THAT IF A LITTLE WATER BE DROPPED INTO THE ACID IT WILL IMMEDIATELY FREEZE AND THE PELLET OF ICE MAY BE DROPPED INTO THE HAND FROM THE STILL RED HOT DISK
THEY DID ME THE HONOUR TO CONSULT ME FIRST AND TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF MY ADVICE FOR I BEGGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD SIZED COW ON IT SO AS TO STAMP OUR PATS OF BUTTER BEFORE THEY WENT TO MARKET ALSO A HORSE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND A FLOCK SNOWED UP AT THE BOTTOM
IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH ITS TEMPERATURE BECOMES SUPPORTABLE BUT ALSO TO THE SINGULAR POWER WHICH THE BODY POSSESSES OF RESISTING GREAT HEATS AND OF BREATHING AIR OF HIGH TEMPERATURES
EVERY EXPIRATION PARTICULARLY IF STRONGLY MADE GAVE A PLEASANT IMPRESSION OF COOLNESS TO THEIR NOSTRILS AND THEIR COLD BREATH COOLED THEIR FINGERS WHENEVER IT REACHED THEM ON TOUCHING HIS SIDE SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN FOUND IT COLD LIKE A CORPSE
AND THEIR MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD TAKEN SOME MONEY WHICH THE DOONES WERE ALWAYS FULL OF DECLARED THAT IT WAS A ROBBERY AND THOUGH IT INCREASED FOR A WHILE THE CUSTOM THAT MUST SOON FALL OFF AGAIN AND WHO WOULD HAVE HER TWO GIRLS NOW CLEVER AS THEY WERE AND GOOD
IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW THE HEAD EYES AND LUNGS ARE PROTECTED THE FIREMAN PUT ON THE ASBESTOS AND WIRE GAUZE CAP AND THE CUIRASS AND HELD THE SHIELD BEFORE HIS BREAST
AND WHEN IN A MANNER QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WHOLLY FREE FROM BITTERNESS I THANKED THEM FOR THIS WHICH APPEARED TO ME THE HIGHEST HONOUR YET OFFERED ME
BUT I SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE GENTLEMEN LET ME FORGET MY LATIN THEN THEY PROPOSED RIDD READETH RIDDLES BUT I BEGGED THEM NOT TO SET DOWN SUCH A LIE FOR NO RIDD EVER HAD MADE OR MADE OUT SUCH A THING AS A RIDDLE SINCE EXMOOR ITSELF BEGAN
LORNA CRIED WHEN I CAME AWAY WHICH GAVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION AND SHE SENT A WHOLE TRUNKFUL OF THINGS FOR MOTHER AND ANNIE AND EVEN LIZZIE AND SHE SEEMED TO THINK THOUGH SHE SAID IT NOT THAT I MADE MY OWN OCCASION FOR GOING
I WAS NOT TO PAY FOR IT THEREFORE SHE HERSELF DID SO QUITE HANDSOMELY AND FELT GOODWILL TOWARDS ME IN CONSEQUENCE NOW BEING IN A HURRY SO FAR AT LEAST AS IT IS IN MY NATURE TO HURRY TO GET TO THE END OF THIS NARRATIVE
OUR DISTINGUISHED COUNTRYMAN SIR F CHANTREY HAS VERY RECENTLY EXPOSED HIMSELF TO A TEMPERATURE STILL HIGHER THAN ANY WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED THE FURNACE WHICH HE EMPLOYS FOR DRYING HIS MOULDS IS ABOUT FOURTEEN FEET LONG TWELVE FEET HIGH AND TWELVE FEET BROAD
FROM THAT AWFUL CIRCUIT OF SHAMBLES THROUGH WHICH HIS NAME IS STILL USED BY MOTHERS TO FRIGHTEN THEIR CHILDREN INTO BED AND RIGHT GLAD WAS I FOR EVEN LONDON SHRANK WITH HORROR AT THE NEWS TO ESCAPE A MAN SO BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGE
GIVES A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ALDINI FROM WHICH THE NATURAL DEDUCTION IS THAT THE CHEVALIER WAS A SHOWMAN WITH AN INTELLECT FULLY UP TO THE DEMANDS OF HIS ART SIR DAVID SAYS
AND REMAINED TEN MINUTES BUT AS THE THERMOMETER SUNK VERY RAPIDLY THEY RESOLVED TO ENTER THE ROOM SINGLY
IN A WORD THEIR TASTE BEING OFFENDED THEY CAME BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND STAMPED AND THERE WAS THE BABY LYING BY EVIL LUCK THIS CHILD BEGAN TO SQUEAL ABOUT HIS MOTHER HAVING BEEN PETTED HITHERTO AND WONT TO GET ALL HE WANTED BY RAISING HIS VOICE BUT A LITTLE
FOR EVEN DE WHICHEHALSE COULD NOT SHOW A BEARING SO MAGNIFICENT BUT THE HERALDS SAID THAT IT LOOKED A MERE SIGN BOARD WITHOUT A GOOD MOTTO UNDER IT AND THE MOTTO MUST HAVE MY NAME IN IT THEY OFFERED ME FIRST RIDD NON RIDENDUS
BUT THE CHILD BEING BORN OF HER MISTRESS SHE WISHED HIM GOOD LUCK AND LEFT HIM AS THE FIERCE MEN CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND BEING ALARMED BY THEIR POWER OF LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUND NO SILVER SHE CREPT AWAY IN A BREATHLESS HURRY AND AFRAID HOW HER BREATH MIGHT COME BACK TO HER
NEARLY EVERYBODY VOWED THAT I WAS A GREAT FOOL INDEED TO NEGLECT SO RUDELY WHICH WAS THE PROPER WORD THEY SAID THE PUSHING OF MY FORTUNES BUT I ANSWERED THAT TO PUSH WAS RUDE AND I LEFT IT TO PEOPLE WHO HAD NO ROOM AND THOUGHT THAT MY FORTUNE MUST BE HEAVY
THE CRUELTY OF THIS MAN IS A THING IT MAKES ME SICK TO SPEAK OF ENOUGH THAT WHEN THE POOR BABY FELL WITHOUT ATTEMPT AT CRY OR SCREAM THINKING IT PART OF HIS USUAL PLAY WHEN THEY TOSSED HIM UP TO COME DOWN AGAIN
HE ADDS THAT WHEN THE HAND WAS DAMPENED WITH ETHER THERE WAS NO SENSATION OF HEAT BUT ON THE CONTRARY AN AGREEABLE FEELING OF COOLNESS BECKMANN IN HIS HISTORY OF INVENTIONS VOL TWO
I BEGGED HIM TO RECONSIDER THE POINT AND NOT TO DEMAND SUCH ACCURACY HE SAID WELL WELL ALL TRADES HAD TRICKS ESPECIALLY THE TRICK OF BUSINESS AND I MUST TAKE HIM IF I WERE HIS TRUE FRIEND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DESCRIPTION
THE METALLIC DRESS WHICH IS SUPERADDED TO THESE MEANS OF DEFENCE CONSISTS OF FIVE PRINCIPAL PIECES
AND MAKING MORE THAN DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES OF LANGUAGE AND THE DIFFERENCE OF TRAINING UPON THE WHOLE THE BALANCE IS IN FAVOUR OF OUR PEOPLE AND THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO WEIGHTS SOLID AND EVEN IN SCALE OF MANNERS OUTWEIGHING ALL LIGHT COMPLAISANCE TO WIT
ONE OF THEM WITH THE BASKET AND CHILD RUSHED INTO A NARROW PLACE WHERE THE FLAMES WERE RAGING EIGHT YARDS HIGH THE VIOLENCE OF THE FIRE WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT BE SEEN WHILE A THICK BLACK SMOKE SPREAD AROUND
AND TOUCHED MY HAT TO THE MAGISTRATES JUST THE SAME AS EVER SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE HIGHEST BLOOD OF WHICH WE THINK A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN OF GOLD AROUND OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD ACTUALLY EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
WITH A MASK LARGE ENOUGH TO LEAVE A PROPER SPACE BETWEEN IT AND THE ASBESTOS CAP A CUIRASS WITH ITS BRASSETS A PIECE OF ARMOUR FOR THE TRUNK AND THIGHS A PAIR OF BOOTS OF DOUBLE WIRE GAUZE
THE INBORN LOVE OF JUSTICE AND THE POWER OF ABIDING YET SOME PEOPLE MAY BE SURPRISED THAT MEN WITH ANY LOVE OF JUSTICE WHETHER INBORN OR OTHERWISE COULD CONTINUE TO ABIDE THE ARROGANCE AND RAPACITY AND TYRANNY OF THE DOONES
THEY INQUIRED STRICTLY INTO THE ANNALS OF OUR FAMILY I TOLD THEM OF COURSE ALL ABOUT KING ALFRED UPON WHICH THEY SETTLED THAT ONE QUARTER SHOULD BE THREE CAKES ON A BAR WITH A LION REGARDANT DONE UPON A FIELD OF GOLD
SUCH A MAN MUST BE VERY WRETCHED IN THIS PURE DEARTH OF MORALITY LIKE A FISHERMAN WHERE NO FISH BE AND MOST OF US HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO ATTEND TO OUR OWN MORALS ENOUGH THAT I RESOLVED TO GO
ELIZABETH DE GRAF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A MUSIC TEACHER IN CLOVERTON OHIO WHILE LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER WIDOWED MOTHER IN A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SECOND CLASS IN NEW YORK
PERHAPS SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE SUGGESTED THE MAJOR WELL I'LL SEE HER AND HER MOTHER TO MORROW MORNING DECIDED UNCLE JOHN
THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
PATSY REMINDED HIM THAT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN TOWN HE MUST PERSONALLY NOTIFY LOUISE MERRICK OF THE PROPOSED TRIP SO HE TOOK A CROSS TOWN LINE AND ARRIVED AT THE MERRICK'S HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK MISSUS MERRICK WAS IN A MORNING WRAPPER
NOT YET HE SAID I'D FORGOTTEN TO MENTION IT TO THEM FOR MY PART CONTINUED THE GIRL I CAN GET READY IN A WEEK EASILY BUT BETH IS WAY OUT IN OHIO AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE CAN GO OR NOT I'LL TELEGRAPH HER AND FIND OUT SAID UNCLE JOHN
HERE YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME HOW EUROPE IS AN EDUCATION AND A DELIGHT AND IN THE NEXT BREATH YOU DELIBERATELY DEPRIVE YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER WHOM YOU PRETEND TO LOVE OF THE ADVANTAGES SHE MIGHT GAIN BY A TRIP ABROAD AND WHY JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT HER YOURSELF
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY SHE'S ENGAGED ASKED MISTER MERRICK AGHAST ONLY FOR THE PARTIES AND RECEPTIONS UNCLE BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF SHE WAS MARRIED SOON SHE'S OLDER THAN BETH OR ME AND HAS A HOST OF ADMIRERS
WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
AND SAT BOLT UPRIGHT GAZING AT HIS COMPANIONS WITH A STARTLED LOOK THAT MELTED INTO ONE OF BENIGN COMPLACENCY AS HE OBSERVED HIS SURROUNDINGS AND REALIZED WHERE HE WAS THE INTERRUPTION GAVE PATSY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PLAYING THE TUNE
IT WILL TAKE A MONTH AT LEAST TO MAKE HER GOWNS AND STUFF AND RUBBISH HE GROWLED THAT SHOWS MARTHA HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIPS NO ONE MAKES GOWNS TO GO ABROAD WITH YOU BUY EM IN PARIS TO BRING HOME
AND IT REQUIRED NO SHREWD GUESSING TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LITTLE PATSY WAS DESTINED TO INHERIT SOME DAY ALL HIS MILLIONS
WHY SO PROPRIETY REQUIRES IT AND SO DOES ORDINARY PRUDENCE LOUISE I KNOW WILL BE DISCREET FOR IT IS HER NATURE BUT PATSY IS SUCH A LITTLE FLYAWAY
WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
AND EUROPE'LL OPEN YOUR EYES AND PROVE TO YOU HOW INSIGNIFICANT YOU REALLY ARE I ADVISE YOU TO VISIT IRELAND SOR WHICH I'M RELIABLY INFORMED IS THE CENTHRAL JEWEL IN EUROPE'S CROWN OF BEAUTY GO
WELL I'M SURE AND THE THING'S SETTLED HE SAID MORE CALMLY DON'T WORRY MA'AM I'LL LOOK AFTER PATSY AND BETH AND LOUISE WILL LOOK AFTER ALL OF US JUST AS SHE DOES AFTER YOU BECAUSE SHE'S SO DISCREET TALK ABOUT YOUR BEING A CHAPERONE
AND IT IS JUST AS WELL TO POSTPONE ANY ENGAGEMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE FACTS I CAN DO THAT NICELY WHILE MY SWEET CHILD IS IN EUROPE WITH UNCLE JOHN AND AWAY FROM ALL DANGER OF ENTANGLEMENTS
JOHN MERRICK WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD BUT AS HALE AND RUGGED AS A BOY OF TWENTY HE HAD MADE HIS VAST FORTUNE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
OH YES YOU WILL IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO BE BREAKIN MY HEART BY STAYIN HOME NEXT WEEK SAID THAT WICKED OLD UNCLE HE REMOINDS ME OF THE ONE THAT TRIED TO DESTHROY THE BABES IN THE WOODS PATSY DEAR YOU MUST TRY TO RECLAIM HIM TO HUMANITY
AND IN THE RACE FOR AUNT JANE'S FORTUNE HE WATCHED THE THREE GIRLS CAREFULLY AND FOUND MUCH TO ADMIRE IN EACH ONE OF THEM PATSY DOYLE HOWEVER PROVED EXCEPTIONALLY FRANK AND GENUINE
OR IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE WORK OF REFORMATION IS NECESSARILY SLOW AMERICANS ESPECIALLY MUST EXERCISE CAUTION IN TRAVELLING IN ANY PART OF SICILY YET WITH PROPER CARE NOT TO TEMPT THE IRRESPONSIBLE NATIVES
AND COULD MAKE NO BETTER REPLY THAN TO STARE BLANKLY AT HER BROTHER IN LAW WE SAIL TUESDAY CONTINUED UNCLE JOHN AND YOU MUST HAVE MY NIECE READY IN TIME AND DELIVER HER ON BOARD THE PRINCESS IRENE AT HOBOKEN AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP
THE MAJOR'S SPEECH HAD A TOUCH OF THE BROGUE WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED BUT RECOVERED WHEN HE CALMED DOWN WHY YOU SELFISH OLD HUMBUG CRIED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WHY CAN'T SHE GO WHEN THERE'S MONEY AND TIME TO SPARE
MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
THE GRIZZLED OLD IRISHMAN HAD BEEN AS TENDER TOWARD HIM AS A WOMAN AND STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SPEECH OR EPITHET THAT BY CHANCE MIGHT INJURE THE FEELINGS OF HIS DEAD WIFE'S ONLY BROTHER BUT THE MAJOR'S INVARIABLE COURTESY TO THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE
MANY WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SOMEWHAT OUTSIDE THE BEATEN TRACKS IN SICILY WILL FRANKLY VOUCH FOR THIS STATEMENT ITALY IS DOING ITS BEST TO SUPPRESS THE MAFIA AND TO ELIMINATE BRIGANDAGE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ISLANDS IT CONTROLS BUT SO FEW OF THE INHABITANTS ARE ITALIANS
AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
THE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED IT WAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN MISS PATRICIA DOYLE'S PRETTY FLAT AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE IN THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM PATRICIA OR PATSY AS SHE PREFERRED TO BE CALLED
AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE MAY ACQUIRE A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEM
WAS SEATED AT THE PIANO SOFTLY PLAYING THE ONE PIECE THE MUSIC TEACHER HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRILLING INTO HER FLIGHTY HEAD BY VIRTUE OF MUCH PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN A THICK CUSHIONED MORRIS CHAIR RECLINED THE MOTIONLESS FORM OF UNCLE JOHN
THE CHARACTERS BEING TAKEN TO ENTIRELY NEW SCENES THE VARIOUS FOREIGN LOCALITIES ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED
AND MISTER MARVIN HAS BEEN SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE THAT I WON'T PLAY HIM A DIRTY TRICK BY LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH PATSY NODDED APPROVAL THAT'S RIGHT DADDY SHE SAID UNCLE JOHN LAY BACK IN THE CHAIR AND PUT THE NEWSPAPER OVER HIS FACE AGAIN
WOULD YOU KEEP HER HERE TO CUDDLE AND SPOIL A VIGOROUS MAN LIKE YOURSELF WHEN SHE CAN RUN AWAY AND SEE THE WORLD AND BE HAPPY IT'S A GREAT HAPPINESS TO CUDDLE THE MAJOR SAID PATSY SOFTLY AND THE POOR MAN NEEDS IT AS MUCH AS HE DOES HIS SLIPPERS
BUT THE MAJOR COULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT THE FLICKER OF AN EYELASH IT WAS NOT THAT HE ADMIRED SO MUCH THE PIECE THE GIRL WAS PLAYING AS THE GIRL WHO WAS PLAYING THE PIECE HIS PRIDE IN PATSY WAS UNBOUNDED
AN SUCH BEAUT CHIFUL THOUGHTS OBSERVED THE MAJOR TESTILY FOR HE RESENTED THE INTERRUPTION OF HIS SUNDAY AFTERNOON TREAT YOU THOUGHT EM ALOUD SIR AND THE SOUND OF IT WAS A BAD IMITHATION OF A BULLFROG IN A MARSH
OR HIS OATMEAL FOR BREAKFAST AND PATSY HAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER ADDED THE MAJOR COMPLACENTLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A SNORT OF CONTEMPT FOR AN UNREASONABLE MAN SHOW ME AN IRISHMAN HE REMARKED
AND NEVER BEFORE HAD AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES HAD SO MANY ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES IT WAS TO CONFER STILL FURTHER BENEFITS UPON THESE GIRLS THAT THEIR ECCENTRIC UNCLE HAD PLANNED THIS UNEXPECTED EUROPEAN TRIP HIS TELEGRAM TO ELIZABETH WAS CHARACTERISTIC
HE SETTLED THE INCOMES OF SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY UPON BOTH BETH AND LOUISE MAKING THEM PRACTICALLY INDEPENDENT FOR PATSY HE BOUGHT A HANDSOME MODERN FLAT BUILDING LOCATED AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE
BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
AS THE FULL MEANING OF UNCLE JOHN'S ABRUPT AVOWAL BECAME APPARENT THE MAJOR WAS STILL FROWNING BUT A HALF FRIGHTENED EXPRESSION HAD REPLACED THE ONE OF SCORNFUL RAILLERY FOR HE TOO KNEW THAT HIS ECCENTRIC BROTHER IN LAW WAS LIKELY TO PROPOSE ANY PREPOSTEROUS THING
AS HE SOMETIMES GRAVELY CALLED IT INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE MUSIC MAJOR DOYLE SAT OPPOSITE STIFFLY ERECT WITH HIS ADMIRING EYES FULL UPON PATSY AT TIMES HE DRUMMED UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR IN UNISON WITH THE MUSIC
AND PAINTING IT A GRIM DESPAIRING GRAY BUT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SUBMIT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SIR SAID HE STERNLY HE ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR WHEN HE WAS IN A SARCASTIC OR REPROACHFUL MOOD I'VE HAD AN IDEA FOR SOME TIME THAT YOU WERE PLOTTING MISCHIEF
A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
AND PATSY'S BRIGHT AND SUNNY DISPOSITION HAD CERTAIN POWER TO CHEER ANY HOME WHETHER LOCATED IN A PALACE OR A HOVEL NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD UNCLE JOHN BEEN SO SUPREMELY HAPPY
I WILL ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US SIR THE BRUTAL SUGGESTION YOU HAVE JUST ADVANCED UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED IN THE DAYS WHEN MAJOR DOYLE HAD THOUGHT HIM A POOR MAN AND IN NEED OF A HELPING HAND
THEN THE MAJOR DREW OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND MOPPED HIS BROW YOU'D LIKE TO GO MAVOURNEEN HE ASKED SOFTLY YES DADDY BUT I WON'T OF COURSE TUT TUT DON'T YOU GO PUTTING YOURSELF AGAINST YOUR OLD FATHER'S WILL PATSY IT'S NOT SO FAR TO EUROPE HE CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY
HAD LONG MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY JOHN MERRICK'S VAST FORTUNE AND AT HIS SOLICITATION IT GAVE MAJOR DOYLE A RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN ITS MAIN OFFICE WITH A SALARY THAT RENDERED HIM INDEPENDENT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDENLY ACQUIRED WEALTH AND MADE HIM PROUD AND SELF RESPECTING
AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
I'VE NO DOUBT LOUISE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GO AND SO WILL I YOU WHY WHY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TAKING JUST THE THREE GIRLS AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES ALSO MINE BUT YOU'LL WANT A CHAPERONE FOR THEM
ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR MOUNTAIN LAIR SO NEAR TO TAORMINA AS I HAVE VENTURED TO LOCATE IT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE ADAPTED THEIR CLEVER SYSTEM OF BRIGANDAGE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS STORY THEIR HISTORY IS TRULY RELATED
SHE WAS IN HIS LAP NOW HER CHUBBY ARMS CLASPED AROUND HIS NECK AND HER SOFT CHEEK LAID CLOSE BESIDE HIS ROUGH AND RUDDY ONE AND WHEN YE GET BACK PATSY DARLIN HE WHISPERED TENDERLY STROKING HER HAIR
AND IN ALL MY HARD WORKING LIFE NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS TRAVELLING OR ENJOYING MYSELF UNTIL I FELL IN WITH YOU AND YOU TAUGHT ME HOW PLEASANT IT IS TO SCATTER SUNSHINE IN THE HEARTS OF OTHERS FOR TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY MEANS A LOT OF JOY FOR YOURSELF
THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
WERE JUST THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DREAMS IN THE WORLD TELL US OF THEM SIR AND WE'LL PROVE THE MAJOR UTTERLY WRONG EVEN HER FATHER SMILED AT THE GIRL'S DIPLOMACY AND UNCLE JOHN WHO WAS ON THE VERGE OF UNREASONABLE ANGER BEAMED UPON HER GRATEFULLY
YOU'RE DREAMING AGAIN PATSY SWUNG HER FEET FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT THE STOOL RAISED HER ENTIRELY OFF THE FLOOR THERE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON HER ROUND FRECKLED FACE AND A WISTFUL ONE IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES
AND YOU WON'T BE AWAY MUCH LONGER THAN YOU WERE WHEN YOU WENT TO ELMHURST AFTER AUNT JANE'S MONEY WHICH YOU DIDN'T GET MARY TAKES FINE CARE OF OUR LITTLE ROOMS AND DOUBTLESS I SHALL BE SO BUSY THAT I WON'T MISS YOU AT ALL AT ALL DADDY
PATSY LOUISE AND I SAIL FOR EUROPE NEXT TUESDAY WILL YOU JOIN US AS MY GUEST IF SO TAKE FIRST TRAIN TO NEW YORK WHERE I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR OUTFIT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS A MESSAGE LIKELY TO SURPRISE A COUNTRY GIRL
UNCLE JOHN MAKES PLANS THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME A LONG TIME AGO UNCLE JOHN RESUMED BUT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT I GOT ALL THE DETAILS FIXED AND SETTLED IN MY MIND I'VE BEEN A ROUGH OLD DUFFER PATSY
BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY YOU'LL GET ME RILED PRETTY SOON MARTHA AND IF YOU DO YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T THIS SPEECH FRIGHTENED THE WOMAN IT WOULDN'T DO TO PROVOKE UNCLE JOHN HOWEVER UNREASONABLE HE HAPPENED TO BE SO SHE SAID MEEKLY
SHE SWUNG AROUND ON THE STOOL AND LOOKED WITH AMUSEMENT AT HER NEWLY AWAKENED UNCLE YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SHE SAID NO INDEED QUITE A MISTAKE REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN SERIOUSLY I'VE ONLY BEEN THINKING
THEY ARE AS SAFE IN SICILY AS THEY ARE AT HOME AUNT JANE'S NIECES ARE SHOWN TO BE AS FRANKLY ADVENTUROUS AS THE AVERAGE CLEAR HEADED AMERICAN GIRL BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AMID THE ENVIRONMENTS OF AN ANCIENT AND STILL PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION ARE IN NO WISE EXTRAORDINARY
HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID UNCLE JOHN I SAY I'VE GOT THREE NIECES AS FINE A TRIO OF INTELLIGENT SWEET AND ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN AS YOU'LL RUN ACROSS IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS I DARE YOU TO DENY IT SIR
YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP EATING THE SALAD SIR BAH DON'T I KNOW ASKED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WELL IF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS BETTER THAN OUR HEARING I SUPPOSE YOU DO RETORTED THE MAJOR BUT TO AN IGNORANT INDIVIDUAL LIKE MESELF
LEST I BE ACCUSED OF UNDUE SENSATIONALISM IN RELATING THE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC SICILIAN INCIDENT I WILL ASSURE MY READER THAT THE STORY DOES NOT EXAGGERATE PRESENT CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND IN FACT IL DUCA AND TATO
YOU'VE NO WORRY AT ALL WHY WE'VE JUST MADE YOU A QUARTER OF A MILLION IN C H AND D'S THE WE IS EXPLAINED BY STATING THAT THE MAJOR HELD AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE A POSITION MISTER MERRICK HAD SECURED FOR HIM SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY
AND HE LOOKED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE ROUND LITTLE MAN UNDER THE NEWSPAPER UNCLE JOHN EMERGED AGAIN IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW WELL HE UNDERSTOOD THE DOYLE FAMILY HIS FACE WAS NOW SMILING AND WORE A LOOK OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
AFTER ALL SHE SIGHED TAKING UP HER CUP AGAIN IT MAY BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LOUISE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOUNG WELDON WHO IS PAYING HER ATTENTIONS JUST NOW IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS FATHER'S MONEY OR NOT HE'S BEEN A BIT WILD I'VE HEARD
WAS NO LONGER IN EVIDENCE WHEN HE FOUND THAT JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WITH A STRONGLY DEFINED HABIT OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS AND STRIVING IN OBSCURE AND UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO MAKE EVERYBODY AROUND HIM HAPPY
PATSY PROVED THE ONE BRIGHT STAR IN THE FIRMAMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT SUPPOSING UNCLE JOHN TO BE POOR SHE INSISTED UPON CARRYING HIM TO NEW YORK WITH HER AND SHARING WITH HIM THE HUMBLE TENEMENT ROOM IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH HER FATHER A RETIRED VETERAN WHO HELPED PAY THE FAMILY EXPENSES
JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
AND THE DEAR CHILD WAS AT THE OPERA LAST NIGHT WHICH MADE HER LATE IN GETTING HOME DOESN'T THE OPERA LET OUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE SAME AS THE THEATRES HE ASKED I BELIEVE SO BUT THERE IS THE SUPPER AFTERWARD YOU KNOW
THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
UNCLE JOHN GREW RED AND HIS EYES FLASHED A CHAPERONE HE CRIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY NOT ANY IN MINE MARTHA MERRICK EITHER WE YOUNG FOLKS GO ALONE WITHOUT ANY DEATH'S HEAD TO PERPETUALLY GLOWER AT US
AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
AND HOLDING THE DIGNIFIED MAJOR IN LOVING REGARD WAS GLAD TO CROSS SWORDS WITH HIM NOW AND THEN TO ADD VARIETY TO THEIR PLEASANT RELATIONS IT'S THIS WAY MAJOR DOYLE HE NOW REMARKED COOLLY
AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
YOU AND BETH SHALL GO ANYHOW AND WE'LL BRING LOUISE A WEDDING PRESENT WITH THIS DECLARATION HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WALKING STICK AND STARTED FOR THE TELEGRAPH STATION LEAVING PATSY AND HER FATHER TO CANVASS THE UNEXPECTED SITUATION
AND GO WHINEVER YOU PLEASE SOR BUT FORBEAR THE WICKEDNESS OF PUTTING FOOLISH THOUGHTS INTO OUR PATSY'S SWEET HEAD SHE CAN'T GO A STEP AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S POSITIVE CRUELTY TO HER SIR TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING
SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
IT'S THE WAY OF LIFE MAVOURNEEN UNLESS A COUPLE HAPPENS TO BE SIAMESE TWINS THEY'RE BOUND TO GET SEPARATED IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS IF NOT FREQUENTLY I WON'T GO DADDY
AND EMPLOY HIS AMPLE WEALTH TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE FOR A TIME KEPT HIS SUCCESS A SECRET AND SO LEARNED MUCH OF THE DISPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS THREE NIECES THEY WERE AT THAT TIME VISITING HIS UNMARRIED SISTER JANE AT HER ESTATE AT ELMHURST
I'M GOING TO EUROPE HE SAID THE MAJOR GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START AND THEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM CURIOUSLY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE PATSY ALONG HE CONTINUED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN THE MAJOR FROWNED
A SECRET YOU WERE TRYING TO KEEP FROM ME YOU CRAFTY YOUNG WOMAN UNTIL I DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT NOW HERE I AM WITH THREE NIECES ON MY HANDS YOU MAY SAY TWO SIR INTERRUPTED THE MAJOR PATSY CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
AND MIGHT BE A BIT LONESOME WITHOUT HER BUT I'LL SETTLE THAT FOOLISHNESS SIR IN SHORT ORDER YOU SHALL GO WITH US IMPOSSIBLE EJACULATED THE MAJOR IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR I'M MOST NEEDED IN THE OFFICE
A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LITTLE MAN INCREASED MIGHTILY BUT HIS RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE PROMPTLY CHANGED AND A CHANCE TO REPROVE OR DISCOMFIT HIS ABSURDLY RICH BROTHER IN LAW WAS ONE OF HIS MOST SATISFACTORY DIVERSIONS UNCLE JOHN APPRECIATED THIS
THAT'S IT SAID UNCLE JOHN YOU'VE MADE ME A QUARTER OF A MILLION THAT I DON'T WANT THE C H AND D STOCKS WERE GOING TO PIECES WHEN I BOUGHT THEM AND I HAD REASON TO HOPE I'D LOSE A GOOD ROUND SUM ON THEM BUT THE CONFOUNDED LUCK TURNED
NODDING HIS GRIZZLED HEAD TO MARK THE TIME AS WELL AS TO EMPHASIZE HIS EVIDENT APPROBATION PATSY HAD PLAYED THIS SAME PIECE FROM START TO FINISH SEVEN TIMES SINCE DINNER BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE SHE KNEW
WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
AND WHERE BY INDUSTRY AND PERSEVERANCE I CAN SCATTER SOME OF MY ILL GOTTEN GAINS THE MAJOR SMILED GRIMLY THAT'S EUROPE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID AND I DON'T OBJECT JOHN TO YOUR GOING THERE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE YOU'RE DISGRACEFULLY COUNTRYFIED
LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED AT ALL IN MASTERING THAT IMPOSING LOOKING INSTRUMENT MAKING IT ACTUALLY PLAY CHUNES WAS SURELY A THING TO WONDER AT BUT THEN PATSY COULD DO ANYTHING IF SHE BUT TRIED SUDDENLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A DREADFUL SNORT
DO IT TO DAY SUGGESTED THE MAJOR I WILL AND TO MORROW YOU MUST SEE LOUISE ADDED PATSY I'M NOT SURE SHE'LL WANT TO GO DEAR SHE'S SUCH A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY YOU KNOW THAT HER ENGAGEMENTS MAY KEEP HER AT HOME

TO BE SURE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WAS NOW IN THE BLUE COUNTRY AND THE FAIRIES THAT DIRECTED ITS FLIGHT MIGHT BE WITH THE UMBRELLA INSTEAD OF WITH THEM YET THE OLD SAILOR HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME STRANGE ADVENTURES IN TROT'S COMPANY
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS IN THE LAND OF OZ OH CRIED TROT TURNING TO STARE AT THE BOY WITH BIG WIDE OPEN EYES WERE YOU EVER IN THE LAND OF OZ YES HE ANSWERED STILL LOOKING AT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER AND THEN HE SAID APPEALINGLY
THESE MEN SEEMED TO BE SOLDIERS ALTHOUGH THEY BORE NO ARMS EXCEPT THE CORDS EACH CORD HAD A WEIGHT AT THE END AND WHEN THE WEIGHT WAS SKILLFULLY THROWN BY A SOLDIER IT WOUND THE CORD AROUND ANYTHING IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
GIVE YOUR MISTRESS MY SALAAM HE REPLIED AND TELL HER THAT THE MOON IS NEW AND THAT I CAN FIND ONLY ELEVEN MONTHS IN THE YEAR AND THE SEA IS BY NO MEANS FULL
WE'LL SOON FIND OUT WHETHER THERE IS ANY MAN THERE THE KING HAD THE PIT DUG AND COMMANDED ALL THE MAIDS BELONGING TO THE PALACE TO TRY TO JUMP OVER IT ALL OF THEM TRIED BUT ONLY ONE SUCCEEDED
BECAUSE HERE IS ONE LIGHTER IN COLOR THAN YOURSELF POINTING TO TROT THIS GIRL IS BY THE LAW OF THE GREAT BOOK THE RIGHTFUL QUEEN OF THE PINKIES AND AS LOYAL CITIZENS YOU ARE ALL OBLIGED TO OBEY HER COMMANDS
THEY WALKED ABOUT THE BAZAAR AND WENT TO THE MOSQUE BUT NOBODY SALUTED THEM OR INVITED THEM TO COME IN AND REST WHAT A LARGE CEMETERY EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN WHAT DOES THE MAN MEAN THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER CALLING THIS LARGELY POPULATED CITY A CEMETERY
BUTTON BRIGHT RELATED THEIR ADVENTURE WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND HOW THE BOOLOOROO HAD STOLEN IT AND THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ESCAPE INTO THE PINK COUNTRY POLYCHROME LISTENED AND THEN TURNED TO THE QUEEN WHY HAVE YOU DECREED DEATH TO THESE INNOCENT STRANGERS SHE ASKED
NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS MEANING THE OLD MAN REPLIED I DON'T KNOW
ON LEAVING THE CITY THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A GRAVEYARD WHERE A FEW PEOPLE WERE PRAYING BESIDE A TOMB AND DISTRIBUTING CHAPATIS AND KULCHAS TO PASSERS BY IN THE NAME OF THEIR BELOVED DEAD THEY BECKONED TO THE TWO TRAVELERS AND GAVE THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD
AND FINALLY THE LUNCH BASKET WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO THE LOWER SEAT AT EVERY FEW STEPS SOME OF THESE WOULD TRIP UP THE CAPTAIN AND CAUSE HIM TO TAKE A TUMBLE
EACH OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES HELD THE END OF A RIBBON
STARTED OFF WHITHERSOEVER FATE MIGHT LEAD HIM HE HAD BEEN GONE SOME DAYS WHEN HE FELL IN WITH AN OLD FARMER WHO ALSO WAS ON A JOURNEY TO A CERTAIN VILLAGE FINDING THE OLD MAN VERY PLEASANT HE ASKED HIM IF HE MIGHT ACCOMPANY HIM
YOUR DUTY WILL BE TO KEEP THE BOOTS AND SHOES OF THE ROYAL FAMILY NICELY POLISHED WITH BLUE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANSWERED BUTTON BRIGHT SURLILY YOU'LL SOON LEARN THE ROYAL STEWARD WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH BLUE PASTE
YOU ARE LIABLE TO BE PATCHED WHAT'S BEING PATCHED INQUIRED THE GIRL THE SOLDIERS ALL LAUGHED AT THIS QUESTION BUT THE KING DID NOT REPLY JUST THEN A DOOR IN THE PALACE OPENED AND OUT TROOPED A GROUP OF GIRLS
TO KNOW THAT HIS MAJESTY WOULD NOT GO BACK FROM HIS THREAT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ADVISED HIS SON TO TRAVEL FOR A TIME UNTIL THE KING'S ANGER SHOULD HAVE SOMEWHAT COOLED THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BOTH CLEVER AND HANDSOME
NEVER SAID THE KING BUT IT MUST BE SO YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE VIZIER AND IN ORDER TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD I PRAY YOU TO CALL TOGETHER ALL THE MAIDS IN YOUR PALACE AND ORDER THEM TO JUMP OVER A PIT WHICH MUST BE DUG
HOWEVER HE KEPT HIS THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF PRESENTLY THEY HAD TO WADE THROUGH A STREAM THAT RAN ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CEMETERY THE WATER WAS RATHER DEEP SO THE OLD FARMER TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS AND CROSSED OVER BUT THE YOUNG MAN WADED THROUGH IT WITH HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS ON
INQUIRED THE THIRD SNUBNOSED ONE BY MEANS OF A MAGIC UMBRELLA WHICH I HAVE CAPTURED AND PUT AWAY IN MY TREASURE CHAMBER REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO
AND GIVE HIM A SUIT OF THE ROYAL LIVERY SO CAP'N BILL WAS LED AWAY BY THE CHIEF OF THE SOLDIERS AND WHEN HE HAD GONE THE KING SAID TO BUTTON BRIGHT YOU SLAVE SHALL BE THE ROYAL BOOTBLUE
COME LET US RETURN AT ONCE TO YOUR CITY AND EXAMINE YOUR BOOK OF LAWS I AM QUITE SURE I CAN FIND IN THEM ABSOLUTE PROTECTION FOR THESE POOR WANDERERS THEY DARED NOT DISOBEY POLYCHROME'S REQUEST SO AT ONCE THEY ALL TURNED AND WALKED BACK TO THE CITY
FOR FIVE MONTHS HE LABORED INDEFATIGABLY TO FIND A REASON FOR THE LAUGHTER OF THE FISH HE SOUGHT EVERYWHERE AND FROM EVERY ONE
I PRESENT YOU TO THE SIX LOVELY SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES TO BE THEIR SLAVE IF YOU ARE GOOD AND OBEDIENT YOU WON'T GET YOUR EARS BOXED OFTENER THAN ONCE AN HOUR I WON'T BE ANYBODY'S SLAVE PROTESTED TROT
DRAGGING THE LITTLE GIRL AFTER THEM DON'T WORRY TROT CRIED BUTTON BRIGHT WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS TROUBLE PRETTY SOON TRUST TO US MATE ADDED CAP'N BILL WE'LL MANAGE TO TAKE CARE O YOU
FAIRIES OF THE SKY WHAT DID I TELL YOU TOURMALINE JUST THEN ONE OF THE MAIDENS TRIPPED LIGHTLY DOWN THE SPAN OF THE ARCH UNTIL NEAR THE VERY END LEANING OVER TO OBSERVE THE GROUP BELOW
I'VE AN IDEA YOUR MAJESTY ANNOUNCED THE SIXTH SNUBNOSED PRINCESS WHOSE COMPLEXION WAS RATHER DARKER THAN THAT OF HER SISTERS AND IT HAS COME TO ME QUITE DELIBERATELY WITHOUT ANY HURRY AT ALL
THERE WERE SIX OF THEM ALL GORGEOUSLY DRESSED IN SILKEN GOWNS WITH MANY PUFFS AND TUCKS AND RUFFLES AND FLOUNCES AND LACES AND RIBBONS EVERYTHING BEING IN SOME SHADE OF BLUE
AN IF ALL THE BLUESKINS ARE LIKE THEIR BOOLOOROO THEY CAN'T BE CALLED FUST CLASS DON'T LET ME HEAR ANY MORE IMPUDENCE PRISONERS CALLED THE BOOLOOROO STERNLY
HE HAS COME THE GREATER PART OF THE WAY WITH ME AND I WANTED HIM TO PUT UP HERE AS LONG AS HE HAD TO STAY IN THIS VILLAGE BUT THE FELLOW IS SUCH A FOOL THAT I CANNOT MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF HIM HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THE BEAM OF THIS HOUSE IS ALL RIGHT
AS IT WAS STILL MUDDY UNDERFOOT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER TOOK A CLOAK FROM ONE OF THE WOMEN PARTLY ROLLED IT AND THREW IT UPON THE GROUND THEN SHE STEPPED UPON IT AND BEGAN WALKING FORWARD THE CLOAK UNROLLED AS SHE ADVANCED AFFORDING A CONSTANT CARPET FOR HER FEET
AND HELD FAST UNTIL IT WAS UNWOUND AGAIN TROT DECIDED THESE BLUESKINS MUST HAVE STOLEN INTO THE GARDEN WHEN SUMMONED BY THE BELLS THE BOOLOOROO HAD RUNG BUT THEY HAD KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE BENCH ON WHICH OUR FRIENDS WERE SEATED
HOW SILLY CRIED AZURE HOW ABSURD CRIED COBALT HOW WICKED CRIED INDIGO AND THEN ALL SIX HELD UP THEIR HANDS AS IF HORRIFIED THE BOOLOOROO LAUGHED
HOW DO YOU MIX IT ASKED CAP'N BILL I DON'T MIX IT IT'S NOT THE BOOLOOROO'S PLACE TO MIX NECTAR WAS THE STERN REPLY BUT YOU MAY INQUIRE OF THE PALACE SERVANTS AND PERHAPS THE ROYAL CHEF OR THE MAJORDOMO WILL CONDESCEND TO TELL YOU
HE WOULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND DASH ALONG THE PATH UNTIL A BOARD OR THE BASKET TRIPPED HIM AGAIN
EVERYONE IN THE PINK COUNTRY IS ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE RULER AND TO A HOUSE AND A GOOD LIVING EXCEPT ONLY THE BLUESKINS IF ANY OF THE NATIVES OF THE BLUE COUNTRY SHOULD EVER BREAK THROUGH THE FOG BANK
OH YES WELL
AND THE ONLY REMINDER OF IT WAS THE LOVELY POLYCHROME STANDING AMONG THE WONDERING BAND OF PINKIES TELL ME SHE SAID GENTLY TO THE BOY WHY ARE YOU HERE AND WHY DO THESE PEOPLE OF THE SKY WISH TO DESTROY YOU IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS
THEIR SKIRTS PREVENTED THEIR LONG LEGS FROM APPEARING AS GROTESQUE AS DID THOSE OF THE MEN BUT THEIR NECKS WERE SO THIN AND LONG THAT THE RUFFLES AROUND THEM ONLY MADE THEM SEEM THE MORE ABSURD AH SAID THE KING WITH A FROWN
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT HOW STUPID PEOPLE WERE TO VENTURE INTO THAT SWIFTLY FLOWING STREAM AND OVER THOSE SHARP STONES WITH BARE FEET THE SLIGHTEST STUMBLE AND THEY WOULD FALL AND BE WETTED FROM HEAD TO FOOT THIS FRIEND OF YOURS IS A MOST WISE MAN
A SCORE OF BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS DRESSED IN FLEECY ROBES OF RAINBOW TINTS WHICH FLUTTERED AROUND THEM LIKE CLOUDS THE DAUGHTERS OF THE RAINBOW WHISPERED TOURMALINE IN AN AWED VOICE AND THE WITCH BESIDE HER NODDED AND SAID
GREET YOUR NEW QUEEN PINKIES ONE BY ONE THEY ALL ADVANCED KNELT BEFORE TROT AND PRESSED HER HAND TO THEIR LIPS LONG LIVE QUEEN MAYRE CALLED OUT CAP'N BILL DANCING AROUND ON HIS WOODEN LEG IN GREAT DELIGHT VIVE LA
THAT IS WHY I AM THE QUEEN YOU WILL NOTICE MY COMPLEXION IS OF A LIGHTER PINK THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER OF MY PEOPLE YES REMARKED POLYCHROME LOOKING AT HER CRITICALLY WHEN YOU WERE MADE QUEEN WITHOUT DOUBT YOU HAD THE LIGHTEST COLORED SKIN IN ALL THE PINK COUNTRY
THE QUEEN RETURNED TO HER ROOM IN A GREAT RAGE AND ON COMING TO SEE HER IN THE EVENING THE KING NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAD DISTURBED HER ARE YOU INDISPOSED HE SAID NO BUT I AM VERY MUCH ANNOYED AT THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF A FISH
AND FOR THOSE OF THE OTHERS WHO FOLLOWED HER SO BEING PROTECTED FROM THE MUD AND WET THEY SPEEDILY GAINED THE CITY AND IN A SHORT TIME WERE ALL GATHERED IN THE LOW ROOM OF TOURMALINE'S PALACE WHERE THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS LAY UPON A TABLE
FOR SHE BELIEVED IN FAIRIES AND TRUSTED THEM BUT BUTTON BRIGHT COULD FIND NO COMFORT IN THEIR SITUATION AND HIS FACE WAS VERY SAD AS HE MARCHED ALONG BY TROT'S SIDE
BUT NOW YOU ARE NO LONGER QUEEN OF THE PINKIES TOURMALINE THOSE ASSEMBLED WERE SO STARTLED BY THIS STATEMENT THAT THEY GAZED AT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IN ASTONISHMENT FOR A TIME THEN TOURMALINE ASKED WHY NOT YOUR HIGHNESS
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS AND NOW THE RAINBOW BEGAN TO FADE GRADUALLY LIKE MIST AND THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHOT ITS CHEERING RAYS OVER THE PINK COUNTRY UNTIL PRESENTLY THE RAINBOW HAD VANISHED ALTOGETHER
AND NOT A SOUL GAVE US A SCRAP OF ANYTHING TO EAT TILL WE WERE PASSING THE CEMETERY BUT THERE SOME PEOPLE CALLED TO US AND PUT INTO OUR HANDS SOME CHAPATIS AND KULCHAS SO MY COMPANION CALLED THE CITY A CEMETERY AND THE CEMETERY A CITY
VIVE LA AH AH TROT THANK YOU POLLY SAID BUTTON BRIGHT GRATEFULLY THIS WILL FIX US ALL RIGHT I'M SURE WHY I HAVE DONE NOTHING RETURNED POLYCHROME SMILING UPON HIM IT IS THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY
IF ONE THINKS OF THE CITY AS THE PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IS TO BE OBTAINED AND OF INHOSPITABLE PEOPLE AS WORSE THAN THE DEAD THE CITY THOUGH CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WAS AS IF DEAD AS FAR AS YOU WERE CONCERNED WHILE IN THE CEMETERY WHICH IS CROWDED WITH THE DEAD
OH I'M ALL RIGHT ANSWERED TROT WITH FINE COURAGE I'M NOT AFRAID OF THESE GAWKIES BUT THE PRINCESSES PULLED HER AFTER THEM AND SOON THEY HAD ALL DISAPPEARED INTO ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE BLUE PALACE NOW THEN SAID THE BOOLOOROO
PROFESSING TO BE ON A VISIT TO THE SAME PLACE THE OLD FARMER AGREED AND THEY WALKED ALONG TOGETHER THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WAY WAS LONG AND WEARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE PLEASANTER IF YOU AND I SOMETIMES GAVE EACH OTHER A LIFT SAID THE YOUTH
POLYCHROME BEGAN TURNING OVER THE LEAVES WHILE THE OTHERS ALL WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY AND IN SILENCE HERE SHE SAID PRESENTLY IS A LAW WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS
TAKE THIS FRIEND AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT BUT MIND AND BRING IT BACK FOR IT IS VERY PRECIOUS THE OLD MAN LOOKING HALF AMUSED AND HALF ANGRY PUSHED BACK THE KNIFE MUTTERING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HIS FRIEND WAS EITHER A FOOL HIMSELF
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL US POLLY CAN'T YOU HELP US POLLY WANTS A CRACKER POLLY WANTS A CRACKER SCREECHED THE PARROT
HE ONLY ASKED YOU TO CUT A COUPLE OF STICKS AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE HIS KNIFE I SEE SAID THE FARMER
BUT LET ME FIRST INQUIRE IF YOU PLEASE WHETHER THE BEAM OF YOUR HOUSE IS STRONG THE OLD FARMER LEFT HIM IN DESPAIR AND ENTERED HIS HOUSE LAUGHING THERE IS A MAN IN YONDER FIELD HE SAID AFTER RETURNING THEIR GREETINGS
ISN'T IT SURPRISING HOW LITTLE MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THEIR LAWS ARE YOU ALL CONTENTED PINKIES SHE ASKED TURNING TO THE PEOPLE
GIVE ME THAT CIRCLET FROM YOUR BROW TOURMALINE WITHOUT HESITATION TOURMALINE REMOVED THE ROSE GOLD CIRCLET WITH ITS GLITTERING JEWEL AND HANDED IT TO POLYCHROME WHO TURNED AND PLACED IT UPON TROT'S BROW THEN SHE CALLED IN A LOUD IMPERATIVE VOICE
YES YES YES OF COURSE THEN ON ENTERING A CERTAIN VILLAGE HE BADE ME TAKE HIS CLASP KNIFE AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT AND BRING BACK THE KNIFE TO HIM
TWO OF YOU SEIZE THE GIRL AND THROW HER OVER SAID TOURMALINE IN A CALM MATTER OF FACT WAY AND TWO OTHERS MUST THROW THE BOY OVER IT MAY TAKE FOUR PERHAPS TO LIFT THE HUGE AND ANCIENT MAN MORE'N THAT SAID CAP'N BILL GRIMLY
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A MAN IN THE PALACE WHO IS PLOTTING AGAINST THE KING'S LIFE JOY JOY EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON
WHILE ONLY ROSALIE THE WITCH LAUGHED AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THE REBUKE BUT PROTESTED TOURMALINE THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS SAYS OUR COUNTRY SHALL HARBOR NONE BUT THE PINKIES DOES IT INDEED ASKED THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
IF THEY HADN'T TAKEN THE UMBRELLA I WOULDN'T CARE HOW LONG WE STOPPED IN THIS FUNNY ISLAND DO YOU THINK IT'S A FAIRY COUNTRY TROT CAN'T SAY I'M SURE SHE ANSWERED I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING HERE YET THAT REMINDS ME OF FAIRIES
HALF WAY THE BEARER OF THIS PRESENT AND MESSAGE MET HIS LITTLE SON WHO SEEING WHAT WAS IN THE BASKET BEGGED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM SOME OF THE FOOD HIS FATHER FOOLISHLY COMPLIED PRESENTLY HE SAW THE YOUNG MAN AND GAVE HIM THE REST OF THE PRESENT AND THE MESSAGE
NOBODY HOWEVER COULD EXPLAIN THE MATTER AND SO HE RETURNED BROKEN HEARTED TO HIS HOUSE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS IN PROSPECT OF CERTAIN DEATH FOR HE HAD HAD SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE OF THE KING
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NO SAID BUTTON BRIGHT
THE MAN MUST BE MAD AND SAYING THIS HE BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER FATHER SAID THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS A VERY SHARP AND WISE GIRL
I'LL SEND ON AHEAD A PRESENT TO THE MAN TO SHOW HIM THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE HIM FOR OUR GUEST
AND DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF THIS FATHER HE SIMPLY WISHED TO KNOW IF THE MAN WAS IN DEBT OR NOT BECAUSE IF THE OWNER OF THE FIELD WAS IN DEBT THEN THE PRODUCE OF THE FIELD WAS AS GOOD AS EATEN TO HIM
WAS IN STOPPIN TO EAT OUR LUNCH BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO CRY OVER SPILT MILK I DON'T MIND NOT MUCH ANYHOW ASSERTED TROT BRAVELY
I KNEW IT WAS CRUEL TO THROW THESE POOR PEOPLE OVER THE EDGE BUT THAT SEEMED TO US THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE IT WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ANSWERED POLYCHROME AS STERNLY AS HER SWEET VOICE COULD SPEAK
I SHALL CALL YOU OLD MOONFACE REPLIED THE KING FOR THAT SUITS YOU QUITE WELL I SHALL APPOINT YOU THE ROYAL NECTAR MIXER TO THE COURT OF SKY ISLAND AND IF YOU DON'T MIX OUR NECTAR PROPERLY I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM AND SPEAK TO HIM VERY WELL SAID THE FARMER I WILL GO AND FIND HIM AND BRING HIM IN TELL HIM FATHER THAT OUR BEAMS ARE STRONG ENOUGH AND THEN HE WILL COME IN
ASKED THE FOURTH PRINCESS I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET SAID THE BOOLOOROO THEY'RE CURIOSITIES YOU SEE AND MAY SERVE TO AMUSE US BUT AS THEY'RE ONLY HALF CIVILIZED I SHALL MAKE THEM MY SLAVES WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR
THERE IS WORK FOR ME TO DO HERE FOR ONE OF MY OLD FRIENDS IS IN TROUBLE WITH THIS SHE SPRANG LIGHTLY FROM THE RAINBOW AND STOOD BESIDE BUTTON BRIGHT AND TROT AND SCARCELY HAD SHE LEFT THE SPLENDID ARCH WHEN IT LIFTED AND ROSE INTO THE SKY
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL TAKE ALL O YOU YOUNG LADY AN THE CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T DO IT THEN THEY HAD HALTED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSHES AND NOW THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AN IMMENSE RAINBOW
I DON'T LIKE THESE SNUBNOSED FUSSY FEMALES AN I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH EM HOW IMPUDENT CRIED CERULIA HOW VULGAR CRIED TURQUOISE HOW UNLADYLIKE CRIED SAPPHIRE
GOODNESS ME YOUR MAJESTY EXCLAIMED THE FIRST WHAT QUEER DREADFUL LOOKING CREATURES ARE THESE WHERE IN ALL THE SKY DID THEY COME FROM
GRADING FROM LIGHT BLUE TO DEEP BLUE THEIR BLUE HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED AND CAME TO A POINT AT THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS THE GIRLS APPROACHED IN A LINE ALONG THE GARDEN PATH ALL WALKING WITH MINCING STEPS AND HOLDING THEIR CHINS HIGH
WHAT A SPLENDID CITY THIS IS SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOW THE MAN MUST SURELY BE DEMENTED THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER I WONDER WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT HE WILL BE CALLING THE LAND WATER AND THE WATER LAND
YOU WERE SALUTED BY KIND FRIENDS AND PROVIDED WITH BREAD TRUE TRUE SAID THE ASTONISHED FARMER
SOAK US AGAIN DROWN US WITH RAIN IT MUTTERED IN A RESIGNED TONE AND THEN IT WOULD TURN TO TROT AND MOAN THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE THE PINKIES ARE A BEASTLY CREW THE COUNTRY WAS NOT SO TRIM AND NEATLY KEPT NEAR THE EDGE
BUT CAP'N BILL SAID A FLOATING ISLAND IN THE SKY WAS SURE TO BE A FAIRYLAND I THINK SO YET MATE RETURNED THE SAILOR BUT THERE'S ALL SORTS O FAIRIES I'VE HEARD SOME IS GOOD AN SOME IS BAD
HERE COME THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ARISTOCRATIC LADIES IN SKY ISLAND THEY'RE SNUBNOSED ALL RIGHT OBSERVED TROT LOOKING AT THE GIRLS WITH MUCH INTEREST
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS THE SERVANT REPEATED THEM WORD FOR WORD AS HE HAD HEARD THEM TO HIS MISTRESS AND THUS HIS THEFT WAS DISCOVERED AND HE WAS SEVERELY PUNISHED AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE YOUNG MAN APPEARED WITH THE OLD FARMER
SO THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALMOST A BEE LINE TO THEIR DESTINATION IT RAINED ALL THE WAY AND THE WALKING WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE BUT OUR FRIENDS WERE CONFRONTING AN IMPORTANT CRISIS IN THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURES AND WITH POSSIBLE DEATH AT THEIR JOURNEY'S END THEY WERE IN NO HURRY TO ARRIVE THERE
THEY ARE BY THIS LAW ENTITLED TO PROTECTION TO A HOME AND GOOD LIVING THE LAW DOES NOT SAY PINKIES IT SAYS ANY WHO ARE IN THE PINK COUNTRY TRUE AGREED CORALIE GREATLY PLEASED
AND ALL THE OTHER PINKIES NODDED THEIR HEADS AND REPEATED TRUE TRUE THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE THE LAW'S THE THING BECAUSE IT'S TRUE CRIED THE PARROT I AM INDEED RELIEVED TO HAVE YOU INTERPRET THE LAW IN THIS WAY DECLARED TOURMALINE
ONE HE TIED AROUND TROT'S WAIST
AND AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD BE HELPLESS UNTIL TWO OF THE PINKIES WHO WERE A STRONG PEOPLE PULLED HIM OUT AGAIN THE PARROT WAS GETTING ITS FEATHERS SADLY DRAGGLED IN THE RAIN AND THE POOR BIRD SOON PRESENTED A WET AND WOEBEGONE APPEARANCE
SHALL BE THE RULER KING OR QUEEN AS LONG AS HE OR SHE LIVES UNLESS SOME ONE OF A LIGHTER SKIN IS FOUND AND THIS RULER'S COMMANDS ALL THE PEOPLE MUST OBEY DO YOU KNOW THIS LAW OH YES REPLIED TOURMALINE
ONCE FREE OF THE CITY THEY TRAVERSED THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HERE THEY OFTEN STEPPED INTO STICKY PINK MUD UP TO THEIR ANKLES CAP'N BILL'S WOODEN LEG WOULD OFTEN GO DOWN DEEP AND STICK FAST IN THIS MUD
UNTIL A SIGNAL FROM THE KING AROUSED THEM TO ACTION THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SURPRISED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF HER CAPTURE AND SO WAS BUTTON BRIGHT CAP'N BILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE WAS AFEARED THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE OUR MISTAKE HE ADDED
BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID ANOTHER PRINCESS OUR SCIENTISTS HAVE PROVED THAT THE EARTH IS NOT INHABITED YOUR SCIENTISTS'LL HAVE TO GUESS AGAIN THEN SAID TROT BUT HOW DID THEY GET TO SKY ISLAND
AND HASTENED AWAY TO THE PALACE BUTTON BRIGHT HAD ALREADY HOOKED THE ROPES TO THE ELEPHANT TRUNK HANDLE SO THAT WHEN THE CAPTAIN CARRIED AWAY THE UMBRELLA HE DRAGGED AFTER HIM FIRST THE DOUBLE SEAT THEN CAP'N BILL'S SEAT WHICH WAS FASTENED TO IT
YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO BRING HER TO TIME I IMAGINE HE REMARKED AND IF THE GIRL ISN'T REASONABLE AND OBEDIENT SEND HER TO ME AND I'LL HAVE HER PATCHED NOW THEN TAKE HER AWAY BUT TROT WAS OBSTINATE AND WOULDN'T BUDGE A STEP
STEADILY YET WITH WONDERFUL SWIFTNESS THE END OF THE GREAT BOW DESCENDED UNTIL IT RESTED UPON THE PINK FIELD ALMOST AT THE FEET OF THE LITTLE PARTY OF OBSERVERS THEN THEY SAW DANCING GAILY UPON THE ARCH
KEEP US TOGETHER YOUR MAJESTY BEGGED CAP'N BILL IF WE'RE TO BE SLAVES DON'T SEPARATE US BUT MAKE US ALL THE SAME KIND O SLAVES I SHALL DO WHAT PLEASES ME DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO ANGRILY DON'T TRY TO DICTATE OLD MOONFACE
GREAT ATTENTION WAS SHOWN TO HIM AND HE WAS TREATED IN EVERY WAY AS IF HE WERE THE SON OF A GREAT MAN ALTHOUGH HIS HUMBLE HOST KNEW NOTHING OF HIS ORIGIN AT LENGTH HE TOLD THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LAUGHING OF THE FISH HIS FATHER'S THREATENED EXECUTION AND HIS OWN BANISHMENT
WHILE WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER HE ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD CARRY ME OR I SHOULD CARRY HIM AS HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A PLEASANTER MODE OF PROCEEDING MOST ASSUREDLY SAID THE GIRL HE MEANT THAT ONE OF YOU SHOULD TELL A STORY TO BEGUILE THE TIME
THERE IS YET TIME FOR ME TO RETURN AND SAVE MY FATHER FROM AN IGNOMINIOUS AND UNJUST DEATH AND THE KING FROM DANGER THE FOLLOWING DAY HE HASTENED BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY TAKING WITH HIM THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER
OR ELSE TRYING TO PLAY THE FOOL WITH HIM THE YOUNG MAN PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HIS REPLY AND REMAINED ALMOST SILENT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY A SHORT DISTANCE OUTSIDE WHICH WAS THE OLD FARMER'S HOUSE
SAID THE OLD MAN TO HIMSELF HOWEVER HE LIKED THE FELLOW AND THINKING THAT HE WOULD AMUSE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER HE INVITED HIM TO COME AND STAY AT HIS HOUSE AS LONG AS HE HAD OCCASION TO REMAIN IN THE VILLAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED
IS IT ASKED THE GIRL MOST CERTAINLY IN THIS FAVORED ISLAND WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE
AND BADE HIM INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND BE READY WITH A SATISFACTORY ANSWER WITHIN SIX MONTHS ON PAIN OF DEATH THE VIZIER PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST THOUGH HE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF FAILURE
IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVAL HE RAN TO THE PALACE AND INFORMED HIS FATHER OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE POOR VIZIER NOW ALMOST DEAD FROM THE EXPECTATION OF DEATH WAS AT ONCE CARRIED TO THE KING TO WHOM HE REPEATED THE NEWS THAT HIS SON HAD JUST BROUGHT
WHEN THE KING TURNED TO HIS MEN AND SAID RELEASE THE PRISONERS THEY ARE NOW QUITE SAFE AND CANNOT ESCAPE ME SO THE MEN UNWOUND THE LONG CORDS THAT WERE TWINED AROUND THE BODIES OF OUR THREE FRIENDS AND SET THEM FREE
BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD MAKE EM MAD TO CALL EM THAT WHY ASKED THE BOOLOOROO IN SURPRISE
I SPEAK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES AND HAVE HEARD WITH MY OWN EARS PASSING STRANGE BE IT SO I WILL INQUIRE CONCERNING IT ON THE MORROW THE KING REPEATED TO HIS VIZIER WHAT HIS WIFE HAD TOLD HIM
WE CAN KEEP HER FOR A LIVING PINCUSHION OH AH THAT WILL BE FINE CRIED ALL THE OTHER FIVE AND THE BOOLOOROO SAID VERY WELL INDIGO IT SHALL BE AS YOU DESIRE THEN HE TURNED TO TROT AND ADDED
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS SOME SHARP CONTRAST TO ENHANCE THE CHARM OF YOUR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THESE THREE PEOPLE WITH YOU WOULD BE A BENEFIT RATHER THAN AN INJURY TO YOU AT THIS THE PINKIES LOOKED DOWNCAST AND ASHAMED
CLEAR CLEAR I REPLIED SO THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WHEN THE NAUTILUS LIES ON THE WAVES UNDER THESE CONDITIONS ONE TENTH OF IT DOES EMERGE ABOVE WATER
LEANED FOR SUPPORT THE OCEAN LAY BENEATH US AT A DEPTH OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET A GRAND AND MIGHTY SPECTACLE WE HAD REACHED THE REGION OF ETERNAL SNOWS THE COLD WAS KEEN
THE TWO HULLS ARE MANUFACTURED FROM BOILERPLATE STEEL
AWAY WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARCHMENT OF ARNE SAKNUSSEMM THE WONDERFUL PRETENSIONS TO DISCOVERY ON THE PART OF MY UNCLE AND TO OUR JOURNEY ALL MUST END IN SMOKE CHARMED WITH THE IDEA
IF THIS THRICE UNHAPPY
SINCE YOUR DAILY EXPERIENCE BEARS THEM OUT BUT AT THIS JUNCTURE I HAVE A HUNCH THAT WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH ONE REAL DIFFICULTY WHAT'S THAT SIR WHEN YOU'RE AT A DEPTH OF ONE THOUSAND METERS THE NAUTILUS'S
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHIPS IN THE GALLANT AMERICAN NAVY BUT THEY ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF ALL THE SAME I WAS CONTENT SIMPLY TO PUT THE FRIGATE IN A CONDITION WHERE IT COULD DO ME NO HARM
THE FIRE IN HIS EYES AND THE PASSION IN HIS GESTURES TRANSFIGURED HIM YES HE LOVED HIS SHIP THE SAME WAY A FATHER LOVES HIS CHILD BUT ONE QUESTION PERHAPS INDISCREET NATURALLY POPPED UP
BUT I CAN ALSO MOVE THE NAUTILUS UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ON A VERTICAL PLANE BY THE SIMPLE METHOD OF SLANTING ITS TWO FINS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO ITS SIDES AT ITS CENTER OF FLOTATION THESE FINS ARE FLEXIBLE ABLE TO ASSUME ANY POSITION
OR PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF DEPTH
PROPORTIONATE REDUCTION IN VOLUME THAT SALT WATER EXPERIENCES IN DEEPER AND DEEPER STRATA THAT'S OBVIOUS I REPLIED NOW THEN IF WATER ISN'T ABSOLUTELY INCOMPRESSIBLE AT LEAST IT COMPRESSES VERY LITTLE
THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL PROFESSOR ARONNAX AND THE CALCULATION IS EASY TO CHECK NOW THEN I HAVE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS
IN FRANCE ITS PROPELLER SHAFT BY PEN AND CO IN LONDON THE SHEET IRON PLATES FOR ITS HULL BY LAIRD'S IN LIVERPOOL ITS PROPELLER BY SCOTT'S IN GLASGOW ITS TANKS WERE MANUFACTURED BY CAIL AND CO IN PARIS
I WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED DESPITE HIS HOT AND FEVERISH IMPATIENCE HE DECIDED WITH A SIGH UPON A HALT HE CALLED THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER TO HIS SIDE THAT WORTHY HOWEVER SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND SILENTLY PILE THEM UP INTO SMALL HEAPS IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT NOT LOSE OUR WAY ON OUR RETURN HE HAD NO IDEA OF THE JOURNEY WE WERE ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE AT ALL EVENTS THE PRECAUTION WAS A GOOD ONE
SUCH AS IT WAS IT SERVED US ADMIRABLY THE ABRUPT CHARACTER OF THE SLOPES MOMENTARILY INCREASED BUT THESE REMARKABLE STONE STEPS A LITTLE LESS DIFFICULT THAN THOSE OF THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS
AND I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THE SUCCESSION OF PHENOMENA WHICH HAD PRECEDED ITS FORMATION ICELAND BEING ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEDIMENTARY SOIL IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF VOLCANIC TUFA THAT IS TO SAY
SEARCHING AND INTENSE THE WIND BLEW WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIOLENCE I WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED MY WORTHY UNCLE THE PROFESSOR SAW CLEARLY THAT MY LEGS REFUSED FURTHER SERVICE AND THAT IN FACT
AS IF SHE HAD EMPLOYED THE PLUMMET LINE THE COMPASS AND THE RULE
BUT FOR THE PRECAUTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF OUR GUIDE OUR DISLOCATED BODIES OUR CRUSHED AND BROKEN LIMBS WOULD HAVE BEEN CAST TO THE WIND LIKE DUST FROM SOME UNKNOWN METEOR
WHAT UNHEARD OF FATIGUE MUST WE ENDURE THE STONES ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE HELD TOGETHER BY NO CEMENT OF SOIL BOUND TOGETHER BY NO ROOTS OR CREEPING HERBS GAVE WAY CONTINUALLY UNDER OUR FEET
AND I COULDN'T RESIST ASKING IT YOU'RE AN ENGINEER THEN CAPTAIN NEMO YES PROFESSOR HE ANSWERED ME I STUDIED IN LONDON PARIS AND NEW YORK BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS A RESIDENT OF THE EARTH'S CONTINENTS
HANS HOWEVER DID NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO PASS THE NIGHT ON THE BARE SIDE OF THE CONE WE THEREFORE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY IN A ZIGZAG DIRECTION THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET WHICH REMAINED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED TOOK US AT
VIA A SIMPLE CALCULATION THE SURFACE AREA AND VOLUME OF THE NAUTILUS ITS SURFACE AREA TOTALS
HERE IN A NUTSHELL I HAD THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PHENOMENA FROM WHICH ICELAND AROSE ALL TAKE THEIR RISE IN THE FIERCE ACTION OF INTERIOR FIRES
YOUR CHIEF SENSATION IS THE CONSTANT FEELING OF AN UNDERLYING CHASM AS THE DUTCHMAN JANSEN SO APTLY PUT IT BUT BELOW THE WAVES ABOARD THE NAUTILUS YOUR HEART NEVER FAILS YOU
THROUGH THE NEWLY FORMED OPENINGS ESCAPED THE MARVELOUS MASS OF BASALTIC STONES WITH WHICH THE PLAIN WE WERE NOW CROSSING WAS COVERED WE WERE TRAMPLING OUR WAY OVER HEAVY ROCKS OF DARK GREY COLOR
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HAMBURG AND NOT AT THE FOOT OF SNEFFELS ONE IDEA ABOVE ALL OTHERS BEGAN TO TROUBLE ME A VERY TERRIBLE IDEA
MY UNCLE WHO NOW WAS SIMPLY PROFESSOR HARDWIGG WAS SO EAGER TO ADVANCE THAT HE BOLTED HIS FOOD LIKE A GREEDY CLOWN THIS HALT FOR REFRESHMENT WAS ALSO A HALT FOR REPOSE
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE FIRST PHENOMENA IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF THE ISLAND WERE SIMPLY ERUPTIVE TO THESE HOWEVER SHORTLY SUCCEEDED THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA
BUT LOWER DOWN WHILE DIVING BENEATH THAT SURFACE ISN'T YOUR SUBMERSIBLE GOING TO ENCOUNTER A PRESSURE AND CONSEQUENTLY UNDERGO AN UPWARD THRUST THAT MUST BE ASSESSED AT ONE ATMOSPHERE PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF WATER HENCE AT ABOUT ONE
IN FACT I WAS ONLY TOO ANXIOUS NOT TO INTERRUPT HIM AND ALLOWED HIM TO REFLECT AT HIS LEISURE AFTER SOME MOMENTS
THE FIELD OF WHICH AS YET IS UTTERLY UNEXPLORED WOULD SUFFICE TO WARM ICELAND FOR A WHOLE CENTURY THIS MIGHTY TURF PIT MEASURED FROM THE BOTTOM OF CERTAIN RAVINES IS OFTEN NOT LESS THAN SEVENTY FEET DEEP
CRUSHED IN ITS FEARFUL EMBRACES THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON VERY COMMON WHEN THE WIND SHAKES THE GLACIERS AND SWEEPS OVER THE ARID PLAINS IS IN THE ICELANDIC TONGUE CALLED MISTOUR
I THROW THE PROPELLER IN GEAR AND THE WATER'S PRESSURE MAKES THE NAUTILUS RISE VERTICALLY AS AN AIR BALLOON INFLATED WITH HYDROGEN LIFTS SWIFTLY INTO THE SKIES BRAVO CAPTAIN I EXCLAIMED
BUT AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS OVERFLOW THE DEPTH OF THE ISLAND INCREASED IT CAN READILY BE BELIEVED WHAT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF ELASTIC FLUIDS WERE PILED UP WITHIN ITS CENTRE
I'LL ASK YOU IF THE NAUTILUS'S RUNNING AFOUL OF THE SCOTIA WHICH CAUSED SUCH A GREAT UPROAR WAS THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL SIR
I MUST SAY THIS FOR MY UNCLE THAT HE STUCK AS CLOSE TO ME AS POSSIBLE HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF ME AND ON MANY OCCASIONS HIS ARM SUPPLIED ME WITH FIRM AND SOLID SUPPORT HE WAS STRONG
BURNED UP ROCKY DETRITUS SEPARATED BY THIN STREAKS OF POROUS SANDSTONE THE GRANDEUR OF THE SPECTACLE WAS UNDOUBTED AS WELL AS ITS ARID AND DESERTED AIR
IT'S A VERY LONG CYLINDER WITH CONICAL ENDS IT NOTICEABLY TAKES THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR A SHAPE ALREADY ADOPTED IN LONDON FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS OF THE SAME KIND
STATIC OBJECTS MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH DYNAMIC ONES OR WE'LL BE OPEN TO SERIOUS ERROR COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT IS SPENT IN REACHING THE OCEAN'S LOWER REGIONS BECAUSE ALL OBJECTS HAVE A TENDENCY TO BECOME SINKERS
BE STILL RISING BY SLOW AND IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES IF THIS REALLY BE THE CASE ITS ORIGIN CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ONLY ONE CAUSE THAT OF THE CONTINUED ACTION OF SUBTERRANEAN FIRES
DECISIVE RESPONSE MISTOUR REPLIED THE GUIDE JA MISTOUR YES THE MISTOUR CRIED ONE OF THE ICELANDIC GUIDES IN A TERRIFIED TONE
JOINING THEM TOGETHER ARE IRON T BARS THAT GIVE THIS SHIP THE UTMOST RIGIDITY IN FACT THANKS TO THIS CELLULAR ARRANGEMENT IT HAS THE RESISTANCE OF A STONE BLOCK AS IF IT WERE COMPLETELY SOLID
THE PROFESSOR WAS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO WAIT THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIS IMPERTURBABLE GUIDE WHO DID NOT GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE FOR A GOOD HOUR THE THREE ICELANDERS
HENCE THE VOLCANOES WHICH SUDDENLY AROSE THROUGH THE UPPER CRUST AND NEXT THE CRATERS WHICH BURST FORTH AT THE SUMMIT OF THESE NEW CREATIONS
WHEN THE COLLISION OCCURRED HOWEVER I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD NO DIRE CONSEQUENCES NONE SIR BUT AS FOR YOUR ENCOUNTER WITH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PROFESSOR THAT TROUBLED ME
CROSS SECTION AND SIDE VIEW OF THE NAUTILUS THEN HE BEGAN HIS DESCRIPTION AS FOLLOWS HERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX ARE THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THIS BOAT NOW TRANSPORTING YOU
AND WE WERE COMPELLED TO GET ROUND THESE OBSTACLES AS BEST WE MIGHT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND ALPINE CLIMBING WILL COMPREHEND OUR DIFFICULTIES OFTEN WE WERE OBLIGED TO HELP EACH OTHER ALONG BY MEANS OF OUR CLIMBING POLES
LAY SCATTERED ON THE GROUND LIKE THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE RUINS ETERNALLY YOUNG
WE FOUND OURSELVES MAKING OUR WAY THROUGH FIBROUS TURF OVER WHICH GREW A SCANTY VEGETATION OF GRASS THE RESIDUUM OF THE ANCIENT VEGETATION OF THE SWAMPY PENINSULA THE VAST MASS OF THIS COMBUSTIBLE
THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE GREAT UNDERTAKING FILLED ME WITH AWE NOW THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY STARTED I BEGAN TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF THE UNDERTAKING OUR PARTY FORMED QUITE A PROCESSION
REFLECTED FROM THE VOLCANO IT STRETCHES ITS HUMBLE TENEMENTS ALONG THE END OF A LITTLE FJORD
BASALT IS A BROWN ROCK OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN IT ASSUMES REGULAR FORMS WHICH ASTONISH
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER HANS PAUSED TO ENABLE US TO LOOK BACK THE MIGHTY WHIRLWIND OF SAND WAS SPREADING UP THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE WE HAD PROPOSED TO HALT HUGE STONES WERE CAUGHT UP
THIS POINT WAS SETTLED BEFORE THEY WOULD AGREE
NO RIGGING TO BE WORN OUT BY ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE WAVES NO SAILS FOR THE WIND TO CARRY OFF NO BOILERS FOR STEAM TO BURST OPEN NO FIRES TO FEAR BECAUSE THIS SUBMERSIBLE IS MADE OF SHEET IRON NOT WOOD
MY SECOND HULL THE OUTER COVER INCLUDES A KEEL FIFTY CENTIMETERS HIGH BY TWENTY FIVE WIDE WHICH BY ITSELF WEIGHS SIXTY TWO METRIC TONS THIS HULL THE ENGINE THE BALLAST
BICONVEX GLASS IS GLASS CAPABLE OF RESISTING SUCH PRESSURES PERFECTLY CAPABLE THOUGH FRAGILE ON IMPACT CRYSTAL CAN STILL OFFER CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE
AND WENT RUSHING BELOW INTO THE PLAINS LIKE A SERIES OF SMALL AVALANCHES IN CERTAIN PLACES THE SIDES OF THIS STUPENDOUS MOUNTAIN WERE AT AN ANGLE SO STEEP THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CLIMB UPWARDS
PLATING BEARS A PRESSURE OF ONE HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES IF AT THIS POINT YOU WANT TO EMPTY THE SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN YOUR BOAT AND RISE TO THE SURFACE YOUR PUMPS MUST OVERCOME THAT PRESSURE OF ONE HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES
BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS HOW CAN YOUR HELMSMAN FOLLOW THE COURSE YOU'VE GIVEN HIM MY HELMSMAN IS STATIONED BEHIND THE WINDOWS OF A PILOTHOUSE WHICH PROTRUDES FROM THE TOPSIDE OF THE NAUTILUS'S HULL AND IS FITTED WITH
THIS WILL GIVE SOME NOTION OF WHAT WE HAD STILL TO UNDERGO SUDDENLY HOWEVER HANS CRIED A HALT THAT IS HE MADE SIGNS TO THAT EFFECT AND A SUMMARY KIND OF BREAKFAST WAS LAID OUT ON THE LAVA BEFORE US
AND THEREFORE WENT LIKE A BRAVE SOLDIER MOUNTING A BRISTLING BATTERY TO THE ASSAULT OF OLD SNEFFELS AS WE ADVANCED THE ROAD BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE DIFFICULT THE SOIL WAS BROKEN AND DANGEROUS
THIS DEMANDS A STRENGTH THAT ELECTRICITY ALONE CAN GIVE ME CAPTAIN NEMO SAID SWIFTLY SIR I REPEAT THE DYNAMIC POWER OF MY ENGINES IS NEARLY INFINITE
I HAD HOWEVER NOTHING TO FEAR
I BEGAN MORE CAREFULLY TO LOOK ABOUT ME A SERIOUS STUDY OF THE SOIL WAS NECESSARY TO NEGATIVE OR CONFIRM MY HYPOTHESIS I TOOK IN EVERY ITEM OF WHAT I SAW
SO I WAS OBLIGED NOT TO EXCEED THIS WEIGHT WHILE BUILDING IT TO THE AFORESAID DIMENSIONS THE NAUTILUS IS MADE UP OF TWO HULLS ONE INSIDE THE OTHER BETWEEN THEM
IT WAS NARROW DIRTY
SOMETIMES HE WOULD DISAPPEAR BEHIND HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE AND WE MOMENTARILY LOST SIGHT OF HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE PERIOD OF ANXIETY AND THEN THERE WAS A SHRILL WHISTLE
SO I CAN DESCEND TO CONSIDERABLE DEPTHS WHEN I WANT TO RISE AGAIN AND LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE ALL I HAVE TO DO IS EXPEL THAT WATER AND IF I DESIRE THAT THE NAUTILUS EMERGE ABOVE THE WAVES TO ONE TENTH OF ITS TOTAL CAPACITY
BY THE ACTION OF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AT WORK IN THE EARTH THE INTERNAL FIRES HOWEVER HAD NOT AS YET BURST THEIR BOUNDS AND FLOODED THE EXTERIOR CAKE OF MOTHER EARTH WITH HOT AND RAGING LAVA
WHAT ARE THEY CAPTAIN I ASKED HERE I'M NATURALLY LED INTO TELLING YOU HOW THE NAUTILUS IS MANEUVERED I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT IN ORDER TO STEER THIS BOAT TO PORT OR STARBOARD IN SHORT
MY UNCLE PARTLY CONFIDED IN HANS THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER
ONE LAST QUESTION CAPTAIN NEMO ASK PROFESSOR YOU'RE RICH THEN INFINITELY RICH SIR AND WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE I COULD PAY OFF THE TEN BILLION FRANC FRENCH NATIONAL DEBT
AND TO BELIEVE THAT THE CENTRAL MASS DID NOT REMAIN IN A STATE OF LIQUID FIRE WHITE HOT WAS SIMPLY AND PURELY MADNESS
CONSEQUENTLY I'D HAVE TO INCREASE MY WEIGHT FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT TWO METRIC TONS TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN SEVEN SO THE ADDED WEIGHT WOULD ONLY BE SIX POINT FIVE SEVEN METRIC TONS
LEAST FIVE HOURS THE TURNINGS AND WINDINGS THE NO THOROUGHFARES THE MARCHES AND MARCHES TURNED THAT INSIGNIFICANT DISTANCE INTO AT LEAST THREE LEAGUES I NEVER FELT SUCH MISERY
IF THESE FINS STAY PARALLEL WITH THE BOAT THE LATTER MOVES HORIZONTALLY IF THEY SLANT THE NAUTILUS FOLLOWS THE ANGLE OF THAT SLANT AND UNDER ITS PROPELLER'S THRUST EITHER SINKS ON A DIAGONAL AS STEEP AS IT SUITS ME
NOW THEN I USE GLASS WINDOWS MEASURING NO LESS THAN TWENTY ONE CENTIMETERS AT THEIR CENTERS IN OTHER WORDS THEY'VE THIRTY TIMES THE THICKNESS FAIR ENOUGH CAPTAIN
OF AN AGGLOMERATION OF STONES AND OF ROCKS OF A POROUS TEXTURE LONG BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF VOLCANOES IT WAS COMPOSED OF A SOLID BODY OF MASSIVE TRAP ROCK LIFTED BODILY AND SLOWLY OUT OF THE SEA
WHICH WHILE COOLING HAD BEEN MOULDED INTO SIX SIDED PRISMS IN THE BACK DISTANCE WE COULD SEE A NUMBER OF FLATTENED CONES WHICH FORMERLY WERE SO MANY FIRE VOMITING MOUTHS
WHO WERE AS TACITURN AS THEIR COMRADE DID NOT SAY A WORD BUT WENT ON EATING AND DRINKING VERY QUIETLY AND SOBERLY FROM THIS OUR FIRST REAL STAGE WE BEGAN TO ASCEND THE SLOPES OF THE SNEFFELS VOLCANO
OH BRAVO BRAVO THREE TIMES OVER CAPTAIN THAT EXPLAINS THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW FROM THIS SO CALLED NARWHALE THAT SO PUZZLED US SCIENTISTS PERTINENT TO THIS
AND UPON THEM I REFLECTED LONG AND DEEPLY I COULD NOT LIE DOWN IN SEARCH OF SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING OF ERUPTIONS
OF SAND OF DUST RISING TO THE HEAVENS IN THE FORM OF A MIGHTY WATERSPOUT IT RESEMBLED THE FEARFUL PHENOMENON OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER KNOWN TO THE TRAVELERS IN THE DESERT OF THE GREAT SAHARA
WAS THE LAST STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY
THESE BALLAST TANKS EXIST WITHIN EASY ACCESS IN THE LOWER REACHES OF THE NAUTILUS
ITS ENGINE BY KRUPP IN PRUSSIA ITS SPUR BY THE MOTALA WORKSHOPS IN SWEDEN ITS PRECISION INSTRUMENTS BY HART BROTHERS IN NEW YORK ET CETERA AND EACH OF THESE SUPPLIERS RECEIVED MY SPECIFICATIONS UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME
THE MECHANICAL FORCES OF THE COMBUSTIBLE GASES BELOW BECAME SO GREAT THAT THEY ACTUALLY UPHEAVED THE WEIGHTY BACK AND MADE FOR THEMSELVES HUGE AND GIGANTIC SHAFTS
THE GUIDE TURNED RAPIDLY IN A DIRECTION WHICH WOULD TAKE US TO THE BACK OF THE CRATER ALL THE WHILE ASCENDING SLIGHTLY WE FOLLOWED RAPIDLY DESPITE OUR EXCESSIVE FATIGUE
THE ICELANDERS THOUGH HEAVILY LOADED CLIMBED WITH THE AGILITY OF MOUNTAINEERS LOOKING UP EVERY NOW AND THEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT VOLCANO OF SNEFFELS IT APPEARED TO ME WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH TO THE SUMMIT ON THAT SIDE
AT ALL EVENTS IF THE ANGLE OF INCLINATION DID NOT SPEEDILY CHANGE FORTUNATELY AFTER AN HOUR OF UNHEARD OF FATIGUES AND OF GYMNASTIC EXERCISES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO AN ACROBAT
AND IF I FILL THEM WITH WATER THE BOAT THEN DISPLACES ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT TWO METRIC TONS OR IT WEIGHS THAT MUCH AND IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY SUBMERGED THAT'S WHAT COMES ABOUT PROFESSOR
CONSEQUENTLY IT COST ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND FRANCS HENCE TWO MILLION FRANCS INCLUDING ITS ACCOMMODATIONS
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IT NEEDED TO DISPLACE ONLY NINE TENTHS OF ITS VOLUME HENCE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR EIGHT CUBIC METERS IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TO WEIGH ONLY THAT SAME NUMBER OF METRIC TONS
THE VARIOUS ACCESSORIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS PLUS THE BULKHEADS AND INTERIOR BRACES
IN DRAWING UP PLANS FOR A SHIP MEANT TO NAVIGATE UNDERWATER I WANTED IT WHEN FLOATING ON THE WAVES TO LIE NINE TENTHS BELOW THE SURFACE AND TO EMERGE ONLY ONE TENTH CONSEQUENTLY
YES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WITH GENUINE EXCITEMENT AND I LOVE IT AS IF IT WERE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD ABOARD A CONVENTIONAL SHIP FACING THE OCEAN'S PERILS DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
THE BOAT SINKS AND IT'S EXACTLY FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FINE CAPTAIN BUT NOW WE COME TO A GENUINE DIFFICULTY YOU'RE ABLE TO LIE FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN THAT I UNDERSTAND
KILOGRAM PER EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER PRECISELY SIR THEN UNLESS YOU FILL UP THE WHOLE NAUTILUS I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN FORCE IT DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THESE LIQUID MASSES PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED
WHEN I THOUGHT MYSELF AT MY LAST GASP ABOUT ELEVEN AT NIGHT IT BEING IN THAT REGION QUITE DARK WE REACHED THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS
THIS EXTRAORDINARY AND CURIOUS ISLAND MUST HAVE MADE ITS APPEARANCE FROM OUT OF THE GREAT WORLD OF WATERS AT A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE LIKE THE CORAL ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC IT MAY FOR AUGHT WE KNOW
LOOKING BACK TO MY RECENT STUDIES I WENT OVER IN THOUGHT THE WHOLE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF ICELAND
KYRKOHERDE CRIED HANS TURNING ROUND AND INTRODUCING HIM TO MY UNCLE
CAST INTO THE AIR AND THROWN ABOUT AS DURING AN ERUPTION WE WERE HAPPILY A LITTLE OUT OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND
AFTER HAVING CLAMBERED UP TWO THOUSAND OF THESE ROUGH STEPS WE FOUND OURSELVES OVERLOOKING A KIND OF SPUR OR PROJECTION OF THE MOUNTAIN A SORT OF BUTTRESS UPON WHICH THE CONELIKE CRATER PROPERLY SO CALLED
WHEN WE HALTED BEFORE THE HOUSE OF THE RECTOR
WE WALKED IN SINGLE FILE PRECEDED BY HANS THE IMPERTURBABLE EIDER DUCK HUNTER HE CALMLY LED US BY NARROW PATHS WHERE TWO PERSONS COULD BY NO POSSIBILITY WALK ABREAST
NO COAL TO RUN OUT OF SINCE ELECTRICITY IS ITS MECHANICAL FORCE NO COLLISIONS TO FEAR BECAUSE IT NAVIGATES THE WATERY DEEP ALL BY ITSELF NO STORMS TO BRAVE BECAUSE JUST A FEW METERS BENEATH THE WAVES IT FINDS ABSOLUTE TRANQUILITY
THE FIRST HULL HAS A THICKNESS OF NO LESS THAN FIVE CENTIMETERS
STONE NOW SCATTERED OVER THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE DISHEVELED HAIR ON THE SHOULDERS OF A
TO MAKE TURNS ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE I USE AN ORDINARY WIDE BLADED RUDDER THAT'S FASTENED TO THE REAR OF THE STERNPOST AND WORKED BY A WHEEL AND TACKLE
THE LENGTH OF THIS CYLINDER FROM END TO END IS EXACTLY SEVENTY METERS AND ITS MAXIMUM BREADTH OF BEAM IS EIGHT METERS SO IT ISN'T QUITE BUILT ON THE TEN TO ONE RATIO OF YOUR HIGH SPEED STEAMERS
A HUGE AND MIGHTY FISSURE MUST REASONING BY ANALOGY HAVE BEEN DUG DIAGONALLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND THROUGH WHICH BY DEGREES FLOWED THE VOLCANIC CRUST THE GREAT AND WONDROUS PHENOMENON
ON WHICH WE WERE PERCHED THIS OPAQUE VEIL STANDING UP BETWEEN US AND THE SUN PROJECTED A DEEP SHADOW ON THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN IF THIS SAND SPOUT BROKE OVER US WE MUST ALL BE INFALLIBLY DESTROYED
THERE OUR NAUTILUS WAS COMPLETED BY ME AND MY WORKMEN IN OTHER WORDS BY MY GALLANT COMPANIONS WHOM I'VE MOLDED AND EDUCATED THEN WHEN THE OPERATION WAS OVER WE BURNED EVERY TRACE OF OUR STAY ON THAT ISLET WHICH IF I COULD HAVE
BUT ITS LINES ARE SUFFICIENTLY LONG AND THEIR TAPERING GRADUAL ENOUGH SO THAT THE DISPLACED WATER EASILY SLIPS PAST AND POSES NO OBSTACLE TO THE SHIP'S MOVEMENTS THESE TWO DIMENSIONS ALLOW YOU TO OBTAIN
FOR NOTHING WOULD BE UNWISER AND MORE INCONSISTENT THAN TO ACT WITH IMPRUDENCE I HEARTILY AGREE WITH YOU MY DEAR UNCLE WAS MY SOMEWHAT HOPEFUL REJOINDER
IT IS NOW SIX HUNDRED YEARS SINCE SNEFFELS HAS SPOKEN BUT THOUGH NOW REDUCED TO A STATE OF UTTER SILENCE
WAS HIS SOLE SPOKEN REPLY IT APPEARS SAYS MY UNCLE WITH A WOEBEGONE LOOK THAT WE MUST GO HIGHER
BUT I WENT ON ONCE THESE PARTS WERE MANUFACTURED DIDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE MOUNTED AND ADJUSTED PROFESSOR I SET UP MY WORKSHOPS ON A DESERTED ISLET IN MIDOCEAN
IF ELSEWHERE WE SEE TRUNCATED CONES IMPERFECT PYRAMIDS WITH AN ODD SUCCESSION OF LINES HERE AS IF WISHING TO GIVE A LESSON IN REGULARITY
THEN WENT ON WITHOUT VIOLENCE THE OUTPOURING WAS ENORMOUS AND THE SEETHING FUSED MATTER EJECTED FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH SPREAD SLOWLY AND PEACEFULLY IN THE FORM OF VAST LEVEL PLAINS OR WHAT ARE CALLED
AND THAT WITH A VIEW TO CONSERVING MY MACHINERY ACCORDINGLY WHEN I HAVE A MIND TO VISIT THE OCEAN DEPTHS TWO OR THREE VERTICAL LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE I USE MANEUVERS THAT ARE MORE TIME CONSUMING BUT NO LESS INFALLIBLE
I EMPTY ALL THE BALLAST TANKS COMPLETELY THIS LOGIC BACKED UP BY FIGURES LEFT ME WITHOUT A SINGLE OBJECTION
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE UTTER ABANDON WITH WHICH I PLACE MY TRUST IN THIS NAUTILUS SINCE I'M ITS CAPTAIN BUILDER AND ENGINEER ALL IN ONE CAPTAIN NEMO SPOKE WITH WINNING ELOQUENCE
BESIDES I USE MY SUPPLEMENTARY BALLAST TANKS ONLY TO REACH AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF
POINT FOUR FIVE SQUARE METERS
ALL THE WHILE LETTING THROUGH STRONG HEAT GENERATING RAYS WHOSE WARMTH
AS A TRUE NEPHEW OF THE GREAT PROFESSOR HARDWIGG AND DESPITE MY PREOCCUPATION AND DOLEFUL FEARS OF WHAT WAS TO COME
IT APPEARS MY DEAR HARRY THAT THIS WORTHY MAN IS THE RECTOR
IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR DURING EXPERIMENTS ON FISHING BY ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH SEA GLASS PANES LESS THAN SEVEN MILLIMETERS THICK
WHEN AT LAST IT AFFORDED NO OTHER OPENINGS AFTER THE PROCESS OF COOLING THE CRUST HAD TAKEN PLACE AT LENGTH A TIME CAME WHEN DESPITE THE ENORMOUS THICKNESS AND WEIGHT OF THE UPPER CRUST
THE ICELANDIC NAME IS STINA IF THIS SINGULAR TORRENT HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED IN ITS DESCENT BY THE PECULIAR SHAPE OF THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN IT WOULD HAVE SWEPT INTO THE SEA AND WOULD HAVE FORMED NEW ISLANDS
SO I DETERMINED AT LAST TO SUBMIT THE WHOLE CASE TO MY UNCLE IN THE MOST ADROIT MANNER POSSIBLE
I'D HAVE BLOWN UP FROM ALL THIS MAY I ASSUME THAT SUCH A BOAT COSTS A FORTUNE AN IRON SHIP PROFESSOR ARONNAX RUNS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FRANCS PER METRIC TON NOW THEN
HASTIGT HASTIGT CRIED OUR GUIDE NOW I CERTAINLY KNEW NOTHING OF DANISH BUT I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS GESTURES WERE MEANT TO QUICKEN US
SNEFFELS IS THE TERMINATION OF A LONG RANGE OF VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER TO THE SYSTEM OF THE ISLAND ITSELF ONE OF ITS PECULIARITIES IS ITS TWO HUGE POINTED SUMMITS
BUT HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO BUILD THIS WONDERFUL NAUTILUS IN SECRET EACH PART OF IT PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAME FROM A DIFFERENT SPOT ON THE GLOBE AND REACHED ME AT A COVER ADDRESS ITS KEEL WAS FORGED BY CREUSOT
ITS MAGNIFICENT SNOWY NIGHTCAP AS WE BEGAN TO CALL IT BY AN OPTICAL DELUSION VERY COMMON IN MOUNTAINS APPEARED TO ME TO BE CLOSE AT HAND
WHICH WHEN ADDED TO THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR POINT NINE SIX METRIC TONS
BUT NOW I WAS ONCE MORE DESTINED TO REALIZE THE ACTUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS
AND THEIR ROADS TABLE BAY HERE TO OUR MUTUAL SURPRISE WE FOUND AN ACTUAL FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS WHICH WONDERFULLY ASSISTED OUR ASCENT THIS SINGULAR FLIGHT OF STAIRS WAS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE VOLCANIC
THERE SIR THERE'S THE IDEAL SHIP AND IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE ENGINEER HAS MORE CONFIDENCE IN A CRAFT THAN THE BUILDER AND THE BUILDER MORE THAN THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF
WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY SUBMERGED
THE ROCKS BROKE AND GAVE WAY UNDER OUR FEET AND WE HAD TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CAREFUL IN ORDER TO AVOID DANGEROUS AND CONSTANT FALLS HANS ADVANCED AS CALMLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING OVER SALISBURY PLAIN
THOUGH HOW UTTERLY USELESS AND UNNECESSARY BUT I MUST NOT ANTICIPATE THREE HOURS OF TERRIBLE FATIGUE WALKING INCESSANTLY HAD ONLY BROUGHT US TO THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MOUNTAIN
AFTER THE BASALTIC ERUPTION WAS APPEASED AND SET AT REST THE VOLCANO THE FORCE OF WHICH INCREASED WITH THAT OF THE EXTINCT CRATERS GAVE FREE PASSAGE TO THE FIERY OVERFLOW OF LAVA
FOLLOW MY LOGIC HERE I'M ALL EARS CAPTAIN WHEN I WANTED TO DETERMINE WHAT INCREASE IN WEIGHT THE NAUTILUS NEEDED TO BE GIVEN IN ORDER TO SUBMERGE I HAD ONLY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE
HE WAS OF A TOO RAGGED AND IDIOTIC APPEARANCE TO SHOW IN A GENTLEMAN'S GROUNDS ONCE OR TWICE HE ENCOUNTERED THE SQUIRE AND STOOD QUAKING WITH HIS FINGERS SPREAD OUT HIS MOUTH AND EYES OPEN AND THE BROOM AT HIS FEET
USE THE ROD WE WON'T GRUMBLE AT YOU FOR DOING SO LITTLE JOE LAMBOLE WHEN HE CAME INTO THE WORLD HAD NOT BEEN EXPECTED TO LIVE
AND SHARP THEY DID NOT FIND THIS OUT THROUGH THE PRAYERS NOR THROUGH THE SERMON BUT WHEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION LEFT THE CHURCH THEY WERE STARTLED TO FIND LITTLE JOE GANDER INSENSIBLE WITH HIS HEAD CUT
AND THEREBY JERKING HIM INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL BEFORE THE MASTER THERE'S NO MAKING NOTHING OUT OF HIM WHACK HIM AS YOU WILL LITTLE JOE LAMBOLE WAS A CHILD OF TEN DRESSED IN SECOND HAND NAY
FOR ALOFT A RED SQUIRREL WAS BARKING A BEAUTIFUL TREE OUT OF WANTONNESS AND FROLIC A RABBIT WOULD COME FORTH FROM THE BRACKEN AND SIT UP IN THE SUN AND CLEAN ITS FACE WITH THE FORE PAWS
A PIGEON BREAST AND A BIG STOMACH HE WALKED WITH HIS HEAD FORWARD AND HIS GREAT PALE BLUE EYES STARING BEFORE HIM INTO THE FAR DISTANCE AS IF HE WERE ALWAYS LOOKING OUT OF THE WORLD HIS WALK WAS A WADDLE
HE PICKED BLACKBERRIES BUT NO SOONER HAD ROGER GALE UNLOCKED HIS DOOR TAKEN DOWN HIS FIDDLE AND DRAWN THE BOW ACROSS THE STRINGS THAN JOE SET DOWN THE CAN AND LISTENED AND WHEN OLD ROGER BEGAN TO PLAY AN AIR FROM THE DAUGHTER OF THE REGIMENT
SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE VERY WELL YOU SHALL SWEEP THE DRIVE THEN FIVEPENCE WILL COME TO US AND YOU SHALL HAVE A PENNY EVERY WEEK TO SPEND IN SWEETSTUFF AT THE POST OFFICE JOE TRIED TO RECKON HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE HE COULD PURCHASE THE FIDDLE
J P AND D L THE RECTOR COUGHED VERY LOUD AND LOOKED HARD AT HIS CHURCHWARDEN FARMER EGGINS WHO TURNED RED AS THE SUN IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND ROSE AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN ROSE
JOE'S FACE BRIGHTENED HE WENT HOME AND TOLD HIS STEPMOTHER
AND A GLIMPSE OF ITS CRIMSON HEAD LIKE A CARBUNCLE RUNNING UP THE TREE TRUNK AND THE POWDERING DOWN OF OLD HUSKS OF FIR CONES OR OF THE TENDER RIND OF THE TOPMOST SHOOT OF A SCOTTISH PINE
AND WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER AN ORDINARY QUESTION WHAT THE LESSON WAS ABOUT THE SCHOOL CHILDREN TORMENTED HIM THE MONITOR SCOLDED AND THE MASTER BEAT THEN LITTLE JOE GANDER TOOK TO ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM SCHOOL
PRESENTLY JOE WAS SEATED ON THE DOORSTEP WITH HIS EAR AGAINST THE WOODEN DOOR AND THE BLACKBERRIES AND THE CAN AND STEPMOTHER'S ORDERS AND FATHER'S STICK AND HIS HARD BED AND HIS MEAGRE MEALS EVEN THE WHOLE WORLD
BUT THE CALCULATION WAS BEYOND HIS POWERS SO HE ASKED THE POSTMAN WHO ASSURED HIM IT WOULD TAKE HIM FORTY WEEKS THAT IS ABOUT TEN MONTHS LITTLE JOE WAS NOT CAST DOWN WHAT WAS TIME WITH SUCH AN END IN VIEW
HE SAW WELL ENOUGH OUT OF THE OTHER HE NEVER MISSED SEEING HIS OWN INTERESTS LAMBOLE COULD HAVE MADE A FEW PENCE WITH HIS SON HAD HIS SON BEEN WORTH ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE SENT HIM TO SCRAPE THE ROAD AND BRING THE MANURE OFF IT IN A SHOVEL TO HIS GARDEN
HE LOOKED UP WITH DAZED FACE FIRST AT ONE MAN THEN AT THE OTHER BOTH THEIR FACES BLAZED WITH EQUAL INDIGNATION BOTH WERE EQUALLY SPEECHLESS WITH WRATH THEY CONDUCTED HIM EACH HOLDING AN ARM OUT OF THE PORCH
BECAUSE THE ORGAN AND THE SINGING THERE DROVE HIM HALF CRAZED WHEN A BEAUTIFUL TOUCHING MELODY WAS PLAYED HIS EYES BECAME CLOUDED AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND WHEN THE ORGAN PLAYED THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS OR SOME GRAND AND STIRRING MARCH
AND STROKE ITS LONG EARS THEN SEEING THE SOILED RED COAT WOULD SKIP UP LITTLE JOE LYING VERY STILL AND SCREW ITS NOSE AND TURN ITS EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE
BUT JOE NEVER TOOK HEARTILY TO SCRAPING THE DUNG UP IN A WORD THE BOY WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING HE HAD HAIR LIKE TOW AND A LITTLE STRAW HAT ON HIS HEAD WITH THE TOP TORN SO THAT THE HAIR FORCED ITS WAY OUT
SOUNDS IN IMITATION OF THE VOICES OF THESE BIRDS MOREOVER THEY STOLE THE BERRIES HE HAD PICKED AND PUT THEM INTO THEIR OWN CANS WHEN JOE GANDER LEFT THEM AND FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE WOODS THEN HE LAY DOWN AMONG THE BROWN HEATHER AND GREEN FERN
AND HIS HEART DANCED AT THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT LIKE MISS AMORY THE CHOIR THE CONGREGATION WERE SINGING THE ADVENT HYMN TO LUTHER'S TUNE GREAT GOD
WAS A ONE STORY COTTAGE OF WOOD AND CLAY COVERED WITH THATCH IN WHICH LIVED ROGER GALE THE POSTMAN ROGER GALE HAD TEN MILES TO WALK EVERY MORNING DELIVERING LETTERS AND THE SAME NUMBER OF MILES EVERY EVENING
THE TWITTERING AND FLUTING AND PIPING OF THE FINCHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND THRUSHES AND THE COOL SOFT COOING OF THE WOOD PIGEONS LIKE THE LOWING OF AERIAL OXEN THEN THE TAPPING OF THE GREEN WOODPECKER
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE SCHOOL HE WENT TO THE COTTAGE IN THE QUARRY AND LISTENED TO THE FIDDLE OF ROGER GALE LITTLE JOE GOT HOLD OF AN OLD BOX AND WITH A KNIFE HE CUT HOLES IN IT AND HE FASHIONED A BRIDGE
DELIVERING THE WRONG MEAT AT THE CUSTOMERS DOORS FOR HIS DILATORY WAYS IN GOING ON HIS ERRANDS THE BUTCHER COULD ENDURE HIM NO MORE AND SENT HIM HOME TO HIS FATHER WHO THRASHED HIM AS HIS WELCOME
HAVE YOU GOT A FIDDLE YES I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AND HEAR YOU PLAY NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY LITTLE JOE FORGOT ABOUT THE DAY AND FORGOT THAT MISS AMORY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN CHURCH IN THE MORNING
AND DREW HIS BOW ACROSS THE SLENDER CORDS THE SOUND WAS VERY FAINT SO FAINT AS TO BE DROWNED BY THE GREATER VOLUME OF THE ORGAN AND THE CHOIR NEVERTHELESS HE COULD HEAR THE FEEBLE TONES CLOSE TO HIS EAR
AND LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OAK LEAVES AT THE SKY AND LISTENED TO THE SINGING OF THE BIRDS OH WONDROUS MUSIC OF THE WOODS THE HUM OF THE SUMMER AIR AMONG THE LEAVES THE DRONE OF THE BEES ABOUT THE FLOWERS
HIS CHEEKS AND CHEST FELL IN DEEPER AND DEEPER AND HIS STOMACH PROTRUDED MORE THAN EVER HIS LEGS SEEMED HARDLY ABLE TO SUPPORT HIM AND HIS GREAT PALE BLUE WANDERING EYES APPEARED READY TO START OUT OF HIS HEAD LIKE THE HORNS OF A SNAIL
AND THE SMELL OF RAW MEAT WAS ABHORRENT TO HIM BUT JOE'S LIKINGS WERE OF NO ACCOUNT WITH HIS FATHER AND HE TOOK HIM TO THE TOWN AND PLACED HIM WITH A BUTCHER THERE HE WAS INVESTED IN A BLUE SMOCK AND WAS INFORMED THAT HIS DUTIES WOULD CONSIST IN TAKING MEAT ABOUT TO THE CUSTOMERS
BUT HE DISAPPOINTED EXPECTATIONS AND LIVED HIS MOTHER DIED SOON AFTER AND HIS FATHER MARRIED AGAIN AND HIS FATHER AND STEPMOTHER LOVED HIM DOUBTLESS BUT LOVE IS MANIFESTED IN MANY WAYS AND THE LAMBOLES SHOWED THEIRS IN A ROUGH WAY
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HE HAD TO HIMSELF ROGER GALE WAS AN OLD SOLDIER AND ENJOYED A PENSION HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WHEN AT HOME AS A SHOEMAKER BUT THE WALKS TOOK SO MUCH OUT OF HIM BEING AN OLD MAN
THAT COULD NOT ROAR BUT WHIMPERED HE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY BAPTISED DIRECTLY HE WAS BORN BECAUSE AT THE FIRST MISSUS LAMBOLE SAID THE CHILD IS MINE THOUGH IT BE SUCH A CREETUR AND I WOULDN'T LIKE IT ACCORDING TO BE BURIED LIKE A DOG
THAT HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH AND ENERGY TO DO MUCH COBBLING WHEN AT HOME THEREFORE HE IDLED A GOOD DEAL AND HE AMUSED HIS IDLE HOURS WITH A VIOLIN NOW WHEN JOE GANDER CAME TO THE QUARRY BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE POSTMAN FROM HIS ROUNDS
JACOB SERVED FOURTEEN YEARS FOR RACHEL AND THIS WAS ONLY FORTY WEEKS FOR A FIDDLE JOE WAS DILIGENT EVERY SATURDAY SWEEPING THE DRIVE HE WAS ORDERED WHENEVER A CARRIAGE ENTERED TO DIVE BEHIND THE RHODODENDRONS AND LAURELS AND DISAPPEAR
AND THE JOY OF PLAYING WITH IT HE WALKED ON SOFTLY INTO THE CHURCH WITHOUT EVEN REMOVING HIS RAGGED STRAW CAP THOUGH THE SQUIRE AND THE SQUIRE'S WIFE AND THE RECTOR AND THE REVEREND THE MISSUS RECTOR AND THE PARISH CHURCHWARDEN
AND ANY CHILD COULD EARN EIGHTPENCE A DAY IN WHORTLEBERRY TIME ONE THAT WAS ACTIVE MIGHT EARN A SHILLING BUT JOE WOULD NOT REMAIN WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN THEY TEASED HIM
EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT HER THE FUTILITY OF DUSTING AT A LOWER LEVEL
I'LL FIDDLE YOUR BACK PRETTY SMARTLY YOU IDLE VAGABOND AND SHE WAS A TRUTHFUL WOMAN WHO NEVER FELL SHORT OF HER WORD TO BREAK HIM OF HIS BAD HABITS THAT IS OF HIS DREAMINESS AND USELESSNESS MISSUS LAMBOLE TOOK JOE
SAID LAMBOLE THRUSTING HOT COALS BACK ON TO THE HEARTH WITH HIS FOOT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WOULD SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE AND YET WE CALL THIS A LAND OF LIBERTY LAW AIN'T MADE FOR THE POOR BUT FOR THE RICH
IN WHICH I HAVE SOME INTEREST THERE'S NO KNOWING SAID THE SQUIRE NO KNOWING BUT THAT WITH WHOLESOME FOOD CLEANLINESS AND KINDNESS HIS FEEBLE MIND MAY BE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR WHICH I LEARN HE HAS NOT YET MASTERED
THAT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF SOME BOYS STEALING THE MEAT OUT OF THE SORT OF TROUGH ON HIS SHOULDER IN WHICH HE CARRIED IT ABOUT THIS WAS THE CLIMAX OF HIS MISDEEDS HE HAD BEEN REPRIMANDED FOR HIS BLUNDERS
BUT WHEN HE WENT AGAIN INTO THE WOOD IT WAS AGAIN THE SAME THE SPELL OF THE WOOD SPIRITS WAS ON HIM HE FORGOT ABOUT THE BERRIES AT FOURPENCE A QUART AND LAY ON HIS BACK AND LISTENED
EVERY SATURDAY EVENING JOE GANDER BROUGHT HIS SIXPENCE HOME TO HIS STEPMOTHER THE WOMAN WAS NOT SO REGULAR IN ALLOWING HIM HIS PENNY OUT
BUT HE CARRIED HOME WITH HIM THE HAUNTING RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT BEAUTIFUL LITTLE RED FIDDLE WITH ITS FINE BLACK KEYS THE BOW HE REMEMBERED WAS STRUNG WITH WHITE HORSEHAIR JOE
AND THE WHOLE WOOD WHISPERED AND SANG TO HIM AND CONSOLED HIM FOR HIS BEATING AND THE WIND PLAYED LULLABIES AMONG THE FIR SPINES AND WHISTLED IN THE GRASS
HAD NOW A FIXED AMBITION SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR HE WOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IF HE COULD HAVE THAT THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENNY FIDDLE BUT HOW WERE THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE TO BE EARNED
AND THEN THE BOY LAUGHED AND THE RABBIT WAS GONE WITH A FLASH OF WHITE TAIL HAPPY DAYS DAYS OF LISTENING TO MYSTERIOUS MUSIC
THERE'S NO GOOD IN HIM SAID HIS STEPMOTHER NOT A MOSSUL WITH THESE WORDS SHE THRUST LITTLE JOE FORWARD BY APPLYING HER KNEE TO THE SMALL OF HIS BACK
MISTER LAMBOLE GOT AN IDEA INTO HIS HEAD HE WOULD BRING UP JOE TO BE A BUTCHER AND HE INFORMED JOE THAT HE WAS GOING TO PLACE HIM WITH A GENTLEMAN OF THAT PROFESSION IN TOWN JOE CRIED HE TURNED SICK AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD
HE DON'T LOOK LIKE A HUMAN CHILD HE DON'T THINK AND FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN THE SHOVELFULS OF DUNG HE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT TO COVER OUR GARDEN IF HE HAD ONLY GIVEN HIS HEART TO IT I'VE HEARD OF CHANGELINGS SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE
AND MISS AMORY HAD TAKEN LESSONS FROM THE BEST MASTERS IN TOWN SHE PLAYED VASTLY BETTER THAN POOR ROGER GALE AND SHE PLAYED TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT SOMETIMES WHILST JOE WAS SWEEPING HE HEARD THE MUSIC
AND BOTH ADVANCED UPON JOE GANDER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE CHURCH AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY TOUCHED HIM THE ORGAN AND THE SINGING CEASED AND IT WAS TO JOE A SUDDEN WAKENING FROM A GOLDEN DREAM TO A BLACK
THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN UTTERED A LOUD AND DISGUSTED UGH THEN WITH HIS HEAVY HAND SLAPPED THE HEAD OF THE CHILD TOWARDS THE PARSON'S CHURCHWARDEN WHO WITH HIS STILL HEAVIER HAND BOXED IT BACK AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN GAVE HIM A BLOW
THEN THE CHURCHWARDENS TURNED BLEW THEIR NOSES AND RE ENTERED THE CHURCH WHERE THEY SAT OUT THE REST OF THE SERVICE GRATEFUL IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY HAD BEEN ENABLED THAT DAY TO SHOW THAT THEIR OFFICE WAS NO SINECURE
ONLY A SEVEN MONTH CHILD SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE CONTEMPTUOUSLY BORN WITHOUT HIS NAILS ON FINGERS AND TOES THEY GROWED LATER HIS WITS HAVE NEVER COME RIGHT AND A DEAL
AND HIS GREAT STOMACH PROTRUDED AND SAID NOTHING SO ROGER BURST OUT LAUGHING
AND WARMED AND RIPENED THEIR FRUIT ON THE HOT STONES IT WAS A MARVEL TO SEE HOW THE BLACKBERRIES GREW IN THIS DESERTED QUARRY HOW LARGE THE FRUIT SWELLED HOW THICK THEY WERE LIKE MULBERRIES ON THE ROAD SIDE OF THE QUARRY WAS A BELT OF PINES
AND DOWN THE AVENUE JOE HEARD INDISTINCTLY BEHIND HIM THE DRONING OF THE RECTOR'S VOICE CONTINUING THE PRAYERS HE LOOKED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SAW THE FACES OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN STRAINING AFTER HIM THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR FROM THEIR PLACES NEAR IT
AND HE CRIED HIMSELF TO SLEEP THE FIRST NIGHT AND HE CRIED ALL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SENT AROUND WITH MEAT ON HIS SHOULDER NOW ON HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THE STREETS HE HAD TO PASS THE WINDOW OF A TOY SHOP IN THE WINDOW WERE DOLLS AND HORSES AND LITTLE CARTS
AND RUNS OFF WITH HER OWN CHILD AND LEAVES YOUR PROPER BABE BEHIND
AND HE TUMBLED OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BECAUSE HE NEVER LOOKED WHERE HE WAS GOING ALWAYS LOOKED TO SOMETHING BEYOND THE HORIZON BECAUSE OF HIS WALK AND HIS LONG NECK AND STARING EYES AND BIG STOMACH THE VILLAGE CHILDREN CALLED HIM GANDER JOE OR JOE GANDER
FOR WHICH TWENTY MILES HE RECEIVED THE LIBERAL PAY OF SIX SHILLINGS A WEEK HE HAD TO BE AT THE POST OFFICE AT HALF PAST SIX IN THE MORNING TO RECEIVE THE LETTERS AND AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING TO DELIVER THEM HIS WORK TOOK HIM ABOUT SIX HOURS
THEN SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE
ASLEEP IN THE SUN WITH WINGS EXPANDED OR DRIFTING ABOUT THE CLUMPS OF YELLOW RAGWORT DOUBTFUL WHETHER TO PERCH OR NOT HERE HIDDEN BEHIND THE TREES AMONG THE LEAVES OF OVERGROWN RUBBLE
OH STEPPY IT WAS SO NICE EVERYTHING WAS SINGING I'LL MAKE YOU SING IN THE CHORUS TOO CRIED MISSUS LAMBOLE AND LAID A STICK ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS
AND THE RECTOR'S CHURCHWARDEN AND THE OVERSEER AND THE WAYWARDEN AND ALL THE FARMERS AND THEIR WIVES WERE PRESENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIS BROKEN CAP IN THE DELIGHT THAT MADE THE TEARS FILL HIS EYES AND TRICKLE OVER HIS PALE CHEEKS
THE CHURCHWARDENS WERE UNAWARE THAT IN BANGING AND KICKING THE LITTLE BOY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD AND INTO THE ROAD THEY HAD FLUNG HIM SO THAT HE FELL WITH HIS HEAD UPON THE CURBSTONE OF THE FOOTPATH WHICH STONE WAS OF SLATE
WHICH SENT HIM STAGGERING FORWARD AND THIS WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY A KICK FROM THE PARSON'S CHURCHWARDEN WHICH SENT JOE GANDER SPINNING DOWN THE FIVE STEPS AT ONCE AND CAST HIM PROSTRATE INTO THE ROAD WHERE HE FELL AND CRUSHED HIS EXTEMPORISED VIOLIN
AND HE BEAT THE BOY TILL HE WAS LIKE A BATTERED APPLE THAT HAD BEEN FLUNG FROM THE TREE BY A STORM UPON A ROAD FOR A WHILE JOE DID NOT VENTURE TO THE QUARRY EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS HE WAS FORBIDDEN BY HIS FATHER TO GO TO CHURCH
HE FORGOT HIS OBLIGATION TO WORK HE FORGOT THE STRICT ORDERS HE HAD RECEIVED NOT TO APPROACH THE GARDEN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE MUSIC ACTED ON HIM LIKE A SPELL OCCASIONALLY HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS DREAM BY THE GARDENER WHO BOXED HIS EARS
AND YOU MUST TEACH THEM AS YOU FEED THE POLAR BEARS WITH THE END OF A STICK ONE DAY MISS AMORY SEEING HOW THIN AND HOLLOW EYED THE CHILD WAS AND HEARING HIM COUGH BROUGHT HIM OUT A CUP OF HOT COFFEE AND SOME BREAD
IT FARED NO BETTER IN AUTUMN WHEN THE BLACKBERRY SEASON SET IN JOE WENT WITH HIS CAN TO AN OLD QUARRY WHERE THE BRAMBLES SENT THEIR RUNNERS OVER THE MASSES OF RUBBLE THROWN OUT FROM THE PITS
HAD PASSED AWAY AS A SCROLL THAT IS ROLLED UP AND LAID ASIDE AND HE LIVED ONLY IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC THOUGH HIS GREAT EYES WERE WIDE HE SAW NOTHING THROUGH THEM
AND THE SUN DREW OUT OF THEIR BARK SCENTS OF UNSURPASSED SWEETNESS ABOUT THE BLACKBERRIES HOVERED SPOTTED WHITE AND YELLOW AND BLACK MOTHS BEAUTIFUL AS BUTTERFLIES BUTTERFLIES DID NOT FAIL EITHER
AND HIS PARENTS WERE NOT SORRY FOR THEY WERE ASHAMED THAT SUCH A CREATURE SHOULD BE KNOWN AS A LAMBOLE THE LAMBOLES WERE A STURDY HEARTY PEOPLE WITH CHEEKS LIKE QUARRENDER APPLES AND BONES SET FIRM AND KNIT WITH IRON SINEWS
THE NETHER GARMENTS HAD IN LIKE MANNER SERVED A FULL GROWN MAN TILL WORN OUT THEN THEY HAD BEEN CUT DOWN AT THE KNEES THOUGH SHORTENED IN LEG THEY MAINTAINED THEIR FORMER COPIOUSNESS OF SEAT AND SERVED AS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE RECEPTACLE FOR DUST
AND THE ASPEN CLASHED ITS MYRIAD TINY CYMBALS TOGETHER PRODUCING AN ORCHESTRA OF SOUND THAT FILLED THE SOUL OF THE DREAMING BOY WITH LOVE AND DELIGHT
WHOM HAVE WE HERE WHAT IS THIS WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE POSTMAN THEN GANDER JOE STOOD UP CRANING HIS LONG NECK AND STARING OUT OF HIS GOGGLE EYES WITH HIS ROUGH FLAXEN HAIR STANDING UP IN A RUFFLE ABOVE HIS HEAD
HE STOPPED TO HEARKEN THEN WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE CHURCHYARD LISTENING A DESIRE CAME ON HIM TO CATCH THE AIR ON HIS IMPROVISED VIOLIN AND HE PUT IT TO HIS SHOULDER
PASSING BETWEEN THE TOMBSTONES DRAWN ON BY THE SOLEMN BEAUTIFUL MUSIC PRESENTLY HE STOOD IN THE PORCH THEN HE WENT ON HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE MUSIC
OF LOOKING INTO MYSTERIES OF SUN AND FOLIAGE OF SPIRITUAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE GREAT MOTHER SOUL OF NATURE
OFTEN AS LITTLE JOE WAS LICKED
BY SLAPS AND BLOWS AND KICKS THE FATHER WAS ASHAMED OF HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A WEAKLING AND THE STEPMOTHER BECAUSE HE WAS UGLY AND WAS NOT HER OWN CHILD HE WAS A MEAGRE LITTLE FELLOW WITH A LONG NECK AND A WHITE FACE AND SUNKEN CHEEKS
HE FELT NOTHING HE HAD BUT ONE FACULTY THAT WAS AWAKE AND THAT WAS HEARING ONE DAY ROGER CAME TO HIS DOOR AND OPENED IT SUDDENLY SO THAT THE CHILD LEANING AGAINST IT FELL ACROSS HIS THRESHOLD
THEY DO SAY THAT THE PIXIES STEAL AWAY THE BABIES OF CHRISTIAN FOLK AND PUT THEIR OWN BANTLINGS IN THEIR STEAD THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO HEAT A POKER RED HOT AND RAM IT DOWN THE THROAT OF THE CHILD
WHAT DO I SEE AND HEAR THE END OF THINGS CREATED LITTLE JOE PLAYING HIS INAUDIBLE INSTRUMENT CAME CREEPING UP THE AVENUE TREADING ON THE FALLEN YELLOW LIME LEAVES
A SWEDE OR A MANGOLD OUT OF FARMER EGGINS'S FIELD SWEDES AND MANGOLDS ARE COOLING TO THE BLOOD AND SIT LIGHT ON THE STOMICK SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE SO THE COMPACT WAS MADE BUT IT NEARLY KILLED JOE
POOR LITTLE MAN HOW OLD ARE YOU DUN'NOW HE ANSWERED CAN YOU READ AND WRITE NO NOR DO SUMS NO WHAT CAN YOU DO FIDDLE
STEPPY NEED I GO TO SCHOOL ANY MORE
HIS EYES FLASHED AND HIS LITTLE BODY QUIVERED AND HE MADE SUCH FACES THAT THE CONGREGATION WERE DISTURBED AND THE PARSON REMONSTRATED WITH HIS MOTHER THE CHILD WAS CLEARLY IMBECILE AND UNFIT TO ATTEND DIVINE WORSHIP
AND A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FOOTWAY THE SQUIRE WAS SHOCKED AS WERE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND THE CHURCHWARDENS WERE IN CONSTERNATION
TO SCHOOL AT SCHOOL HE HAD A BAD TIME OF IT HE COULD NOT LEARN THE LETTERS HE WAS MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF DOING A SUBTRACTION SUM HE SAT ON A BENCH STARING AT THE TEACHER
AND THEN A HANDLE AND HE STRUNG HORSEHAIR OVER THE LATTER AND MADE A BOW AND DREW VERY FAINT SOUNDS FROM THIS IMPROVISED VIOLIN THAT MADE THE POSTMAN LAUGH BUT WHICH GAVE GREAT PLEASURE TO JOE
FOR THESE JOE DID NOT CARE BUT THERE WERE ALSO SOME LITTLE VIOLINS SOME HIGH PRICED AND SOME VERY LOW AND OVER THESE JOE LINGERED WITH LOVING COVETOUS EYES THERE WAS ONE LITTLE FIDDLE TO WHICH HIS HEART WENT OUT
THEN JOE CREPT TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE IN LITTLE STAGES OF WONDERMENT AND HUNGER TO HEAR MORE AND HEAR BETTER MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS NOW AND AGAIN IN THE WOOD THE INQUISITIVE RABBITS HAD APPROACHED HIS RED JACKET
THEY THOUGHT HIM A FOOL AND THAT HE HAD THE INQUISITIVENESS OF THE HALF WITTED TO PEER IN AT WINDOWS AND SEE THE PRETTY SIGHTS WITHIN HE WAS REPRIMANDED AND THREATENED WITH DISMISSAL
THE SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM HIS INSTRUMENT WAS LIKE THE HUMMING OF FLIES BUT HE GOT DISTINCT NOTES OUT OF HIS STRINGS THOUGH THE NOTES WERE FAINT AFTER HE HAD PLAYED TRUANT FOR SOME TIME HIS FATHER HEARD WHAT HE HAD DONE
AS FOR HIS VOICE IT WAS THIN AND TONELESS LIKE THE NOTES ON HIS IMPROVISED FIDDLE ON WHICH HE PLAYED INCESSANTLY THE CHILD WILL ALWAYS BE A DISCREDIT TO US SAID LAMBOLE
COMING UP THE NAVE FIDDLING WITH HIS HAT ON REGARDLESS OF THE SACREDNESS OF THE PLACE
THIRD HAND GARMENTS THAT DID NOT FIT HIS COAT HAD BEEN A SOLDIER'S SCARLET UNIFORM THAT HAD GONE WHEN DISCARDED TO A DEALER WHO HAD DEALT IT TO A CARTER AND WHEN THE CARTER HAD WORN IT OUT IT WAS REDUCED AND ADAPTED TO THE WEAR OF THE CHILD
HE TOOK IT WITHOUT A WORD ONLY PULLING OFF HIS TORN STRAW HAT AND THROWING IT AT HIS FEET EXPOSING THE FULL SHOCK OF TOW LIKE HAIR THEN HE STARED AT HER OUT OF HIS GREAT EYES SPEECHLESS JOE SHE SAID
ONCE A SERVANT CAME OUT FROM MISS AMORY TO TELL THE RAGGED LITTLE BOY NOT TO STAND IN FRONT OF THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW STARING IN ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE WAS FOUND BY MISS AMORY
HE CONFIDED HIS DIFFICULTY TO POSTMAN ROGER GALE AND ROGER GALE SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER THE MATTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE POSTMAN SAID TO JOE GANDER THEY WANT A LAD TO SWEEP THE LEAVES IN THE DRIVE AT THE GREAT HOUSE
IT IS WICKEDNESS ARGUED THE FATHER IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH COLTS ALL WICKEDNESS YOU MUST DRIVE IT OUT WITH THE STICK AND NOW A GREAT TEMPTATION FELL ON LITTLE GANDER JOE
THIS WAS FLATTERING TO THE POSTMAN AND IT WAS THE INITIATION OF A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THEM BUT WHEN JOE CAME HOME WITH AN EMPTY CAN AND SAID OH STEPPY MASTER ROGER GALE DID FIDDLE SO BEAUTIFUL THE WOMAN SAID FIDDLE
THEY WERE A HARD WORKING PRACTICAL PEOPLE WHO FATTENED PIGS AND KEPT POULTRY AT HOME LAMBOLE WAS A ROADMAKER IN BREAKING STONES ONE DAY A BIT OF ONE HAD STRUCK HIS EYE AND BLINDED IT AFTER THAT HE WORE A BLACK PATCH UPON IT
AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE MISS AMORY WAS MUSICAL HER MOTHER PLAYED ON THE PIANO AND THE YOUNG LADY ON THE VIOLIN
HE WAS CALLED JOSEPH THE SCRIPTURAL JOSEPH HAD BEEN SOLD AS A BONDMAN INTO EGYPT THIS LITTLE JOSEPH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TO BE A SLAVE IN ALL PROPRIETY HE OUGHT TO HAVE DIED AS A BABY AND THAT HAPPY CONSUMMATION WAS ALMOST DESIRED
POOR FELLOW SAID THE SQUIRE TO THE GARDENER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CHARITY TO EMPLOY HIM BUT I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED SOMEONE ELSE WITH HIS WITS ABOUT HIM I WILL SEE TO HAVING HIM SENT TO AN ASYLUM FOR IDIOTS
AND AS HE WALKED THE TOP BOBBED ABOUT LIKE THE LID OF A BOILING SAUCEPAN WHEN THE WHORTLEBERRIES WERE RIPE IN JUNE MISSUS LAMBOLE SENT JOE OUT WITH OTHER CHILDREN TO COLLECT THE BERRIES IN A TIN CAN SHE SOLD THEM FOR FOURPENCE A QUART
THAT COST ONLY THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE EACH DAY AS HE PASSED THE SHOP HE WAS DRAWN TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING IN AND LONGED DAILY MORE ARDENTLY THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY FOR THIS THREE AND SIXPENNY VIOLIN
SHE HAD ASKED TO SEE HIS FIDDLE SO IN THE MORNING HE TOOK IT AND WENT DOWN WITH IT TO THE PARK THE CHURCH WAS WITHIN THE GROUNDS AND HE HAD TO PASS IT AS HE WENT BY HE HEARD THE ROLL OF THE ORGAN AND THE STRAINS OF THE CHOIR
VERY WELL EATING SUCH A LOT DOES NO ONE GOOD IF YOU WILL BE CONTENT WITH ONE SLICE OF BREAD FOR BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF TWO AND THE SAME FOR SUPPER YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PENNY
THE SQUIRE'S COACHMAN TOLD ME AND I MENTIONED YOU
THEN HE STOLE NEARER AND NEARER TO THE HOUSE HIDING BEHIND RHODODENDRON BUSHES AND LISTENING WITH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS AND EARS THE MUSIC EXERCISED ON HIM AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION
A NAME WAS PROCLAIMED BASED UPON THAT OF THE HIGHEST DIVINITIES KNOWN TO THE ANCIENT AYMARA RACE ILLATICI VIRACOCHA PACHACAMAC LITERALLY THE THUNDER VASE THE FOAM OF THE SEA
IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS QUITE DISSIMILAR AND MAKES NO MENTION OF A SERPENT AND AS WE SHALL HEREAFTER SEE NEITHER AMONG THE ALGONKINS NOR ANY OTHER INDIANS WAS THE SERPENT USUALLY A TYPE OF EVIL
BUT AS A POPULAR ERROR IT STILL HOLDS ITS GROUND WITH REFERENCE TO THE MORE BARBAROUS AND LESS KNOWN TRIBES PERHAPS NO MYTH HAS BEEN SO OFTEN QUOTED IN ITS CONFIRMATION AS THAT OF THE ANCIENT IROQUOIS WHICH NARRATES
FOR IT IS EVOLVED FROM THE LAWS OF REASON OUR ONLY TEST OF TRUTH FURTHERMORE THE SENSE OF PERSONALITY AND THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE ANALYZED TO THEIR SOURCES CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE ASSUMPTION OF AN INFINITE PERSONALITY
HE DOUBLES THE WORD OR PREFIXES AN ADJECTIVE OR ADDS AN AFFIX AS THE GENIUS OF HIS LANGUAGE MAY DICTATE BUT IT STILL REMAINS TO HIM BUT AN UNAPPLIED ABSTRACTION A MERE CATEGORY OF THOUGHT
IS A BELIEF THAT SHOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY WHEN THE DELIGHTS OF SAVAGE LIFE AND THE PRAISES OF A STATE OF NATURE CEASED TO BE THE THEMES OF PHILOSOPHERS
BUT HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE VERY TEXTURE OF THE HUMAN MIND THE HEAVENS THE UPPER REGIONS ARE IN EVERY RELIGION THE SUPPOSED ABODE OF THE DIVINE WHAT IS HIGHER IS ALWAYS THE STRONGER AND THE NOBLER
THE KINDLY GOD WHO CURED DISEASES AIDED THEM IN THE CHASE AND APPEARED TO THEM IN DREAMS AS THEIR PROTECTOR THEREFORE WITH GREAT JUSTICE DOCTOR JARVIS HAS EXPLAINED IT TO MEAN
AND AN ABSOLUTE STANDARD OF RIGHT OR IF TO SOME ALL THIS APPEARS BUT WIRE DRAWN METAPHYSICAL SUBTLETY THEY ARE WELCOME TO THE DEFINITION OF THE REALIST
IT HAS BEEN RENDERED SPIRIT DEMON GOD DEVIL MYSTERY MAGIC BUT COMMONLY AND RATHER ABSURDLY BY THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH MEDICINE
NOR DID THE PRINCE OF TEZCUCO AFTERWARDS NEGLECT THE HONORS DUE HIS NATIONAL GODS NOR EVEN REFRAIN HIMSELF FROM PLUNGING THE KNIFE INTO THE BREASTS OF CAPTIVES
INVISIBLE IMPONDERABLE QUICKENING WITH VIGOROUS MOTION SLACKENING IN REST AND SLEEP PASSING QUITE AWAY IN DEATH IT IS THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF LIFE ALL NATIONS GRASPED THE ANALOGY AND IDENTIFIED THE ONE WITH THE OTHER
THE CONFUSION OF THESE DISTINCT IDEAS HAS LED TO MUCH MISCONCEPTION OF THE NATIVE CREEDS BUT ANOTHER AND MORE FATAL ERROR WAS THAT WHICH DISTORTED THEM INTO A DUALISTIC FORM
THE WRITER APPEARS TO COMPARE THE GREAT POWER ASSIGNED BY THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION TO SATAN AND HIS ALLIES WITH THE VERY MUCH LESS POTENCY ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR ANALOGUES IN HEATHENDOM
THEIR UNANIMOUS TESTIMONY THAT THE IDEA OF A DEVIL A PRINCE OF DARKNESS THEY FIRST RECEIVED IN LATER TIMES
WHERE THE WORSHIP OF AN IMMATERIAL GOD WAS DEFINITELY INSTITUTED AND THESE AS THE HIGHEST CONQUESTS OF AMERICAN NATURAL RELIGIONS DESERVE ESPECIAL MENTION THEY OCCURRED AS WE MIGHT EXPECT IN THE TWO MOST CIVILIZED NATIONS
AND AM PERSUADED THAT THOSE PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THEM AS DOING SO DO IT INCONSIDERATELY AND BECAUSE IT IS SO NATURAL TO SUBSCRIBE TO A LONG CHERISHED POPULAR OPINION
WHO WAS WHO IS WHO WILL BE SO THE BELIEF IN AN UNSEEN SPIRIT WHO ASKS NEITHER SUPPLICATION NOR SACRIFICE WHO AS THE NATIVES OF TEXAS TOLD JOUTEL IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR
AND THE STARS WHICH ADORN IT AND WHICH LIGHT THE EARTH WITH ITS COUNTLESS STREAMS ITS FOUNTAINS AND WATERS ITS TREES AND PLANTS AND ITS VARIOUS INHABITANTS THERE MUST BE SOME GOD INVISIBLE AND UNKNOWN
THAT THERE IS A HIGHEST AND FIRST PRINCIPLE WHICH RECONCILES ALL THEIR DISCREPANCIES AND BINDS THEM INTO ONE THIS HE CALLS THE IDEAL OF REASON IT MUST BE TRUE
THAN THAT WHICH PRETENDS THAT A PURER AND MORE MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION EXISTS AMONG NATIONS DEVOID OF MYTHOLOGY THERE ARE ONLY TWO INSTANCES ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
AND PERSONIFIED IN THEIR MYTHS IT WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN BORN OF THE BREATH OF TEZCATLIPOCA THEIR HIGHEST DIVINITY WHO HIMSELF IS OFTEN CALLED YOALLIEHECATL
A SUPERIOR IS ONE WHO IS BETTER THAN WE ARE AND THEREFORE A CHIEFTAIN IN ALGONKIN IS CALLED OGHEE MA THE HIGHER ONE THERE IS MOREOVER A NAIF AND SPONTANEOUS INSTINCT WHICH LEADS MAN IN HIS ECSTASIES OF JOY
THEY FOUND NOT ONLY THE WALLS ADORNED WITH HIDEOUS PAINTINGS BUT AN UGLY IDOL OF WOOD REPRESENTING A MAN OF COLOSSAL PROPORTIONS SET UP THEREIN
AND SAID TO BE THEIR WICKED SPIRIT IS IN FACT THE ONLY NAME IN THEIR LANGUAGE FOR SPIRITUAL EXISTENCE IN GENERAL
THE EXHIBITIONS OF FORCE IN NATURE SEEMED TO THEM THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THAT MYSTERIOUS POWER FELT BY THEIR SELF CONSCIOUSNESS TO COMBINE THESE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS AND RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE OPERATIONS OF ONE PERSONALITY
ALL ORIGINALLY MEANT THE SKY ABOVE AND OUR OWN WORD HEAVEN IS OFTEN EMPLOYED SYNONYMOUSLY WITH GOD THERE IS AT FIRST NO PERSONIFICATION IN THESE EXPRESSIONS THEY EMBRACE ALL UNSEEN AGENCIES
THE GODS OF THE PRIMITIVE MAN ARE BEINGS OF THOROUGHLY HUMAN PHYSIOGNOMY PAINTED WITH COLORS FURNISHED BY INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS THESE ARE HIS ENEMIES OR HIS FRIENDS AS HE CONCILIATES OR INSULTS THEM
HE ERECTED A TEMPLE NINE STORIES HIGH TO REPRESENT THE NINE HEAVENS WHICH HE DEDICATED TO THE UNKNOWN GOD THE CAUSE OF CAUSES THIS TEMPLE HE ORDAINED SHOULD NEVER BE POLLUTED BY BLOOD
A VAGUE TERM MENTIONED BY ROGER WILLIAMS AND OTHER EARLY WRITERS
IN DAKOTA NIYA IS LITERALLY BREATH FIGURATIVELY LIFE IN NETELA
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO BROTHERS OF OUR RACE IT IS OF UNDOUBTED NATIVE ORIGIN AND VENERABLE ANTIQUITY THE VERSION GIVEN BY THE TUSCARORA CHIEF CUSIC IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE
VERY SOON AFTER COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE WHITES THE INDIANS CAUGHT THE NOTION OF A BAD AND GOOD SPIRIT PITTED ONE AGAINST THE OTHER IN ETERNAL WARFARE AND ENGRAFTED IT ON THEIR ANCIENT TRADITIONS
THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH POWER THEY WERE BUT ANNOYERS AND OPPOSERS OF MEN
IS TO THIS DAY THE CORRECT TERM IN THEIR LANGUAGE FOR THE TROPICAL WHIRLWIND AND THE NATIVES OF PANAMA WORSHIPPED THE SAME PHENOMENON
COULD BE WITHOUT SOME NOTION OF DIVINITY CERTAINLY IN AMERICA NO INSTANCE OF ITS ABSENCE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED OBSCURE GROTESQUE UNWORTHY IT OFTEN WAS BUT EVERYWHERE MAN WAS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSUS NUMINIS
ABOVE IN THE SAME SENSE AND IT EVEN HAD PASSED INTO A DEFINITE PERSONIFICATION AMONG THEM IN THE SHAPE OF AN IDOL OF WOOD EVIL FAVOREDLY CARVED IN PURER DIALECTS OF THE ALGONKIN
AND AS IN THIS WORD SUPERNATURAL WE SEE A TRANSFER OF A CONCEPTION OF PLACE AND THAT IT LITERALLY MEANS THAT WHICH IS ABOVE THE NATURAL WORLD SO IN SUCH AS WE CAN ANALYZE OF THESE VAGUE AND PRIMITIVE TERMS THE SAME TROPE APPEARS DISCOVERABLE
THE FORMER OF THESE NAMES IS MERELY THE WORD GREAT IN THEIR DIALECT OF ALGONKIN WITH A FINAL N AND IS PROBABLY AN ABBREVIATION OF KITTANITOWIT THE GREAT MANITO
WHO IS THE UNIVERSAL CREATOR HE ALONE CAN CONSOLE ME IN MY AFFLICTION AND TAKE AWAY MY SORROW STRENGTHENED IN THIS CONVICTION BY A TIMELY FULFILMENT OF HIS HEART'S DESIRE
I TELL YOU THAT HE OUR FATHER AND MASTER THE SUN MUST HAVE A LORD AND MASTER MORE POWERFUL THAN HIMSELF
OMNIPOTENT INVISIBLE ADORABLE SUCH APPELLATIONS AS THE MAKER AND MOULDER OF ALL THE MOTHER AND FATHER OF LIFE THE ONE GOD COMPLETE IN PERFECTION AND UNITY
FOR THE CONCEPTION OF A WHOLLY GOOD OR A WHOLLY EVIL NATURE REQUIRES THE USE OF THESE TERMS IN THEIR HIGHER ETHICAL SENSE
BUT THE BREATH IS NOTHING BUT WIND HOW EASY THEREFORE TO LOOK UPON THE WIND THAT MOVES UP AND DOWN AND TO AND FRO UPON THE EARTH THAT CARRIES THE CLOUDS ITSELF UNSEEN THAT CALLS FORTH THE TERRIBLE TEMPESTS
OF BREATH WITH LIFE OF LIFE WITH SOUL OF SOUL WITH GOD LIES THE FAR DEEPER AND FAR TRUER REASON WHOSE INSENSIBLE DEVELOPMENT I HAVE HERE TRACED IN OUTLINE INDEED BUT CONFIRMED BY THE EVIDENCE OF LANGUAGE ITSELF
WAKAN AS AN ADVERB MEANS ABOVE OKI IS BUT ANOTHER ORTHOGRAPHY FOR OGHEE
IS THE BENIGN POWER APPEALED TO BY THEIR PRIESTS WHO IS THRONED IN THE PLEIADES WHO SENDS FRUITS AND FLOWERS TO THE EARTH
FOR IN THE DARK REALMS OF THE UNDERWORLD HE STILL LIVES RECEIVING THE SOULS OF THE DEAD AND BEING THE AUTHOR OF ALL EVIL NOW WHEN WE COMPARE THIS WITH THE VERSION OF THE SAME LEGEND GIVEN BY FATHER BREBEUF
JUST AS MUCH THE IDEA OF A BAD AS OF A GOOD SPIRIT HE IS UNAWARE OF ANY DISTINCTION
MISSIONARY TO THE HURONS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX WE FIND ITS WHOLE COMPLEXION ALTERED THE MORAL DUALISM VANISHES THE NAMES GOOD MIND AND BAD MIND DO NOT APPEAR IT IS THE STRUGGLE OF IOSKEHA THE WHITE ONE
THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES VERY RARELY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL DEITIES WHEN SPEAKING OF THE RELIGION OF THE NORTHERN TRIBES AND THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN AMONG THE ALGONKINS AND IROQUOIS PLACE ON RECORD
HE WORSHIPS NOT THE INFINITE HE THINKS BUT A BASE IDOL OF HIS OWN MAKING AS IN THE ZEND AVESTA BEHIND THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE OF ORMUZD AND AHRIMAN LOOMS UP THE UNDISTURBED AND INFINITE ZERUANA AKERANA
AND AS A METAPHOR IN THEIR SPEECHES AND AS A PAINT EXPRESSIVE OF FRIENDLY DESIGN
WHILE THE KINDLIEST DIVINITIES WERE DISPOSED TO PUNISH AND THAT SEVERELY ANY NEGLECT OF THEIR CEREMONIES MORAL DUALISM CAN ONLY ARISE IN MINDS WHERE THE IDEAS OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH THOSE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
THIS FAMOUS MAGICIAN TRIED HIS ARTS ON THE PRINCE OF SERPENTS AFTER A PROLONGED STRUGGLE WHICH BROUGHT ON THE GENERAL DELUGE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD HE WON THE VICTORY THE FIRST AUTHORITY WE HAVE FOR THIS NARRATIVE
AND MAGNILOQUENCE USED BY THE PRIESTS AND DEVOTEES OF EVERY SEVERAL GOD TO DO HIM HONOR THEY PROVE SOMETHING IN REGARD TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF DIVINITY HEDGING US ABOUT BUT NOTHING AT ALL IN FAVOR OF A RECOGNITION OF ONE GOD
MAN CANNOT ESCAPE THE BELIEF THAT BEHIND ALL FORM IS ONE ESSENCE BUT THE MOMENT HE WOULD SEIZE AND DEFINE IT IT ELUDES HIS GRASP
A FRAME FOR THE ALL IT IS NEVER THE OBJECT OF VENERATION OR SACRIFICE NO MYTH BRINGS IT DOWN TO HIS COMPREHENSION IT IS NOT INSTALLED IN HIS TEMPLES
ALL ARE DIRECTLY FROM VERBAL ROOTS EXPRESSING THE MOTION OF THE WIND OR THE BREATH THE HEBREW WORD RUAH IS TRANSLATED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT SOMETIMES BY WIND SOMETIMES BY SPIRIT SOMETIMES BY BREATH
THEY EXEMPLIFY HOW PROFOUND IS THE CONVICTION OF A HIGHEST AND FIRST PRINCIPLE BUT THEY DO NOT OFFER THE LEAST REASON TO SURMISE THAT THIS WAS A LIVING REALITY IN DOCTRINE OR PRACTICE
IN A VALE BY THE SEA NEAR CALLAO WHEREIN HIS WORSHIP WAS TO BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT IMAGES OR HUMAN SACRIFICES THE INCA WAS AHEAD OF HIS AGE HOWEVER AND WHEN THE SPANIARDS VISITED THE TEMPLE OF PACHACAMAC IN FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE
THE SUPPOSITION THAT IN ANCIENT TIMES AND IN VERY UNENLIGHTENED CONDITIONS BEFORE MYTHOLOGY HAD GROWN A MONOTHEISM PREVAILED WHICH AFTERWARDS AT VARIOUS TIMES WAS REVIVED BY REFORMERS
THE WIND OF LIVES ARMED WITH THESE ANALOGIES WE TURN TO THE PRIMITIVE TONGUES OF AMERICA AND FIND THEM THERE AS DISTINCT AS IN THE OLD WORLD
AND AEMI TO BLOW IN GREEK THE WORDS FOR SOUL OR SPIRIT
RELATES THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THINGS THERE WERE TWO BROTHERS
OR IN THE DIM PANTHEISTIC SENSE OF THE BRAHMINS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT THE MISSIONARIES FOUND NO WORD IN ANY OF THEIR LANGUAGES FIT TO INTERPRET DEUS GOD
THE REPLY TO THIS IS GIVEN US BY IMMANUEL KANT HE HAS SHOWN THAT OUR REASON DWELLING ON THE FACTS OF EXPERIENCE CONSTANTLY SEEKS THE PRINCIPLES WHICH CONNECT THEM TOGETHER AND ONLY RESTS SATISFIED IN THE CONVICTION
IT REAPPEARS UNDER THE CURIOUS FORM QUAKER DOUBTLESS A CORRUPTION OF THE POWHATAN QUI OKI
NOW MANY THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THE SUN IS ABSENT THEREFORE HE CANNOT BE THE UNIVERSAL CREATOR AND THAT HE IS ALIVE AT ALL IS DOUBTFUL FOR HIS TRIPS DO NOT TIRE HIM WERE HE A LIVING THING HE WOULD GROW WEARY LIKE OURSELVES
WE SHALL BE FAR FROM REGARDING THEM AS FAMILIAR TO THE POPULAR MIND
A WORD COMPREHENDING ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE UNSEEN WORLD
ETYMOLOGICALLY IN FACT GHOSTS AND GUSTS BREATHS AND BREEZES THE GREAT SPIRIT AND THE GREAT WIND ARE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS EASY TO GUESS THE REASON OF THIS THE SOUL IS THE LIFE THE LIFE IS THE BREATH
IN THE ALGONKIN DIALECTS THIS WORD IS MANITO AND OKI IN IROQUOIS OKI AND OTKON
AND THE REASONING FACULTY THE SUPREME EXISTENCE THEY CALL SILLAM INNUA OWNER OF THE AIR OR OF THE ALL OR SILLAM NELEGA LORD OF THE AIR OR WIND IN THE YAKAMA TONGUE OF OREGON
YET THEIR OWN WRITINGS FURNISH CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT NO SUCH DISTINCTION EXISTED OUT OF THEIR OWN FANCIES THE SAME WORD OTKON WHICH FATHER BRUYAS EMPLOYS TO TRANSLATE INTO IROQUOIS THE TERM DEVIL
AND IN HIS PAROXYSMS OF FEAR OR PAIN TO LIFT HIS HANDS AND EYES TO THE OVERHANGING FIRMAMENT THERE THE SUN AND BRIGHT STARS SOJOURN
IT IS ALWAYS INDEFINITE AS IN THE TERMS NIPOON OKI SPIRIT OF SUMMER PIPOON OKI SPIRIT OF WINTER PERHAPS THE WORD WAS INTRODUCED INTO IROQUOIS BY THE HURONS NEIGHBORS AND ASSOCIATES OF THE ALGONKINS
TO WHOM THEY PRAY TO THE NEGLECT OF A BETTER ONE IS IN REALITY THE HIGHEST POWER THEY RECOGNIZE
NO MERE MAN LEAST OF ALL A SAVAGE IS KIND AND BENEVOLENT IN SPITE OF NEGLECT AND INJURY NOR IS ANY MAN CAUSELESSLY AND CEASELESSLY MALICIOUS PERSONAL FAMILY OR NATIONAL FEUDS RENDER SOME MORE INIMICAL
LORD OF THE SKY PRINCE OF THE AZURE PLANISPHERE HE ABOVE ALL ARE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND BY A STILL BOLDER METAPHOR THE ARAUCANIANS ACCORDING TO MOLINA ENTITLED THEIR GREATEST GOD THE SOUL OF THE SKY
WKRISHA SIGNIFIES THERE IS WIND WKRISHWIT LIFE WITH THE AZTECS
LET NONE OF THESE EXPRESSIONS HOWEVER BE CONSTRUED TO PROVE THE DISTINCT RECOGNITION OF ONE SUPREME BEING OF MONOTHEISM EITHER AS DISPLAYED IN THE ONE PERSONAL DEFINITE GOD OF THE SEMITIC RACES
HAS ARISEN PARTLY FROM HABITS OF THOUGHT DIFFICULT TO BREAK PARTLY FROM MISTRANSLATIONS OF NATIVE WORDS PARTLY FROM THE FOOLISH AXIOM OF THE EARLY MISSIONARIES THE GODS OF THE GENTILES ARE DEVILS
IS FOREIGN TO ALL PRIMITIVE RELIGIONS YET PROFESSOR MUELLER IN HIS VOLUMINOUS WORK ON THOSE OF AMERICA AFTER APPROVINGLY QUOTING THIS SAYING COMPLACENTLY PROCEEDS TO CLASSIFY THE DEITIES AS GOOD
WHO GETS ALL THE BLOWS THIS NOTION WHICH HAS ITS HISTORICAL ORIGIN AMONG THE PARSEES OF ANCIENT IRAN IS UNKNOWN TO SAVAGE NATIONS THE IDEA OF THE DEVIL JUSTLY OBSERVES JACOB GRIMM
HOW COULD THEY EXPECT IT THE ASSOCIATIONS WE ATTACH TO THAT NAME ARE THE ACCUMULATED FRUITS OF NIGH TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY THE PHRASES GOOD SPIRIT GREAT SPIRIT AND SIMILAR ONES
RANGING ON ONE HAND THE GOOD SPIRIT WITH HIS LEGIONS OF ANGELS ON THE OTHER THE EVIL ONE WITH HIS SWARMS OF FIENDS REPRESENTING THE WORLD AS THE SCENE OF THEIR UNENDING CONFLICT MAN AS THE UNLUCKY FOOTBALL
SO IT IS WITH THE STORY THE ALGONKINS TELL OF THEIR HERO MANIBOZHO WHO IN THE OPINION OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER
FOR THE POPULAR ONE THE INCA CONTINUED TO RECEIVE THE HOMAGE OF HIS SUBJECTS AS A BROTHER OF THE SUN AND THE REGULAR SERVICES TO THAT LUMINARY WERE NEVER INTERRUPTED
WRITTEN IN SIXTEEN TWENTY TWO THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE INDIANS WORSHIP A GOOD POWER CALLED KIEHTAN AND ANOTHER WHO AS FARRE AS WEE CAN CONCEIVE IS THE DEVILL NAMED HOBBAMOCK OR HOBBAMOQUI
THE AZTEC TEOTL THE QUICHUA HUACA AND THE MAYA KU
HE TOLD THEM THAT THE DEITY THEY ADORED WAS A DEMON WHO LOVED ALL EVIL THINGS AND THEY MUST HATE HIM WHEREUPON HIS AUDITORS REPLIED THAT SO FAR FROM THIS BEING THE CASE WHOM HE CALLED A WICKED BEING WAS THE POWER THAT SENT THEM ALL GOOD THINGS
AT LENGTH IN INDIGNATION AND DESPAIR THE PRINCE EXCLAIMED VERILY THESE GODS THAT I AM ADORING WHAT ARE THEY BUT IDOLS OF STONE WITHOUT SPEECH OR FEELING THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE BEAUTY OF THE HEAVEN THE SUN THE MOON
THE HURONS APPLIED IT TO THAT DEMONIAC POWER WHO RULES THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHO HOLDS THE WINDS AND THE WAVES IN LEASH
A FEELING THAT INVISIBLE POWERFUL AGENCIES WERE AT WORK AROUND HIM WHO AS THEY WILLED COULD HELP OR HURT HIM IN EVERY HEART WAS AN ALTAR TO THE UNKNOWN GOD NOT THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO ATTACH ANY IDEA OF UNITY TO THESE UNSEEN POWERS
WHICH FINDS ITS MEANING IN THE ANCIENT TONGUE OF HAITI
SO THE PRIMITIVE MAN IN FORMING HIS LANGUAGE SOMETIMES TROD ONE SOMETIMES ANOTHER WHATEVER ELSE SCEPTICS HAVE QUESTIONED NO ONE HAS YET PRESUMED TO DOUBT THAT IF A GOD AND A SOUL EXIST AT ALL THEY ARE OF LIKE ESSENCE
NONE HAVE TRACED IT TO ITS TRUE SOURCE THE FACTS OF METEOROLOGY HAVE BEEN THOUGHT ALL SUFFICIENT FOR A SOLUTION AS IF MAN EVER DID OR EVER COULD DRAW THE IDEA OF GOD FROM NATURE IN THE IDENTITY OF WIND WITH BREATH
ROSE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE AND SPOKE SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS MANY SAY THAT THE SUN IS THE MAKER OF ALL THINGS BUT HE WHO MAKES SHOULD ABIDE BY WHAT HE HAS MADE
EXAMPLES NO CONSCIOUS MONOTHEISM AND BUT LITTLE IDEA OF IMMATERIALITY DISCOVERABLE STILL LESS ANY MORAL DUALISM OF DEITIES THE GREAT GOOD SPIRIT AND THE GREAT BAD SPIRIT
THE CREATOR OF ALL THAT IS THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IN USE AND OF UNDOUBTED INDIGENOUS ORIGIN NOT ONLY AMONG THE CIVILIZED AZTECS BUT EVEN AMONG THE HAITIANS THE ARAUCANIANS
THIS FIRM BELIEF HAS LEFT ITS IMPRESS ON LANGUAGE IN THE NAMES DEVISED TO EXPRESS THE SUPERNAL THE SPIRITUAL WORLD
WERE HE FREE HE WOULD VISIT OTHER PARTS OF THE HEAVENS HE IS LIKE A TETHERED BEAST WHO MAKES A DAILY ROUND UNDER THE EYE OF A MASTER HE IS LIKE AN ARROW WHICH MUST GO WHITHER IT IS SENT NOT WHITHER IT WISHES
THAN OTHERS BUT ALWAYS FROM A DESIRE TO GUARD THEIR OWN INTERESTS NEVER OUT OF A DELIGHT IN EVIL FOR ITS OWN SAKE THUS THE CRUEL GODS OF DEATH DISEASE AND DANGER WERE NEVER OF SATANIC NATURE
AND THE NAHUAS OF TEZCUCO IT IS RELATED THAT ABOUT THE YEAR FOURTEEN FORTY AT A GRAND RELIGIOUS COUNCIL HELD AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE NEWLY BUILT TEMPLE OF THE SUN AT CUZCO THE INCA YUPANQUI
AS IN THE PAGES OF THE GREEK POETS WE HERE AND THERE CATCH GLIMPSES OF A ZEUS WHO IS NOT HE THRONED ON OLYMPUS NOR HE WHO TAKES PART IN THE WRANGLES OF THE GODS BUT STANDS FAR OFF AND ALONE ONE YET ALL
WAS DOUBTLESS OCCASIONALLY PRESENT TO THEIR MINDS IT WAS PRESENT NOT MORE BUT FAR LESS DISTINCTLY AND OFTEN NOT AT ALL IN THE MORE SAVAGE TRIBES AND NO ASSERTION CAN BE MORE CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF RELIGIOUS PROGRESS
NOT IN CONTRAST TO POLYTHEISM BUT IN LIVING INTUITION IN THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS IF THIS SUBTLE BUT TRUE DISTINCTION BE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IT WILL EXCITE NO SURPRISE TO FIND SUCH EPITHETS AS ENDLESS
OURAGAN ORKAN WAS ADOPTED INTO EUROPEAN MARINE LANGUAGES AS THE NATIVE NAME OF THE TERRIBLE TORNADO
THE SHADOWY EMBODIMENT OF EVIL BUT SIMPLY AND SOLELY THEIR GOD OF THE DEAD THE PLUTO OF THEIR PANTHEON CORRESPONDING TO THE MICTLA OF THE MEXICANS THE EVIDENCE ON THE POINT IS INDEED CONCLUSIVE
WAS GARONHIA WHICH AGAIN TURNS OUT ON EXAMINATION TO BE THEIR COMMON WORD FOR SKY AND AGAIN IN ALL PROBABILITY FROM THE VERBAL ROOT GAR
FINDS A REMARKABLE PROOF IN THE MYTHS OF THE QUICHES WHICH WERE COMMITTED TO WRITING IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY NARRATE THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE RULERS OF THE UPPER AND THE NETHER WORLD THE DESCENT OF THE FORMER INTO XIBALBA
THIS LAST EXPRESSION LEADS TO ANOTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT AS THE PHILOSOPHER PONDERING ON THE WORKINGS OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS RECOGNIZES THAT VARIOUS PATHWAYS LEAD UP TO GOD
IN THE LEGENDS OF THE QUICHES THE MYSTERIOUS CREATIVE POWER IS HURAKAN A NAME OF NO SIGNIFICATION IN THEIR LANGUAGE ONE WHICH THEIR REMOTE ANCESTORS BROUGHT WITH THEM FROM THE ANTILLES
AND THE VARIOUS SEASONS AS THE BREATH THE SPIRIT OF GOD AS GOD HIMSELF SO IN THE MOSAIC RECORD OF CREATION IT IS SAID A MIGHTY WIND PASSED OVER THE FORMLESS SEA AND BROUGHT FORTH THE WORLD
WHICH IS THE SAME WORD IN THE VOCATIVE CASE AS THE LATINS CALLED THEIR UNITED DIVINITIES SUPERI THOSE ABOVE SO CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH FOUND THAT THE POWHATANS OF VIRGINIA EMPLOYED THE WORD OKI
WITH HIS BROTHER TAWISCARA THE DARK ONE AND WE AT ONCE PERCEIVE THAT CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE IN THE COURSE OF TWO CENTURIES HAD GIVEN THE TALE A MEANING FOREIGN TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT
THEY ARE VOID OF PERSONALITY AND YET TO THE ILLOGICAL PRIMITIVE MAN THERE IS NOTHING CONTRADICTORY IN MAKING THEM THE OBJECT OF HIS PRAYERS THE MAYAS HAD LEGIONS OF GODS
IT IS WELL NOT ONLY TO TRACE THIS IDEA IN ITS VERY EARLIEST EMBODIMENT IN LANGUAGE BUT ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF COMPARISON
HAVE OCCASIONED ENDLESS DISCREPANCIES IN THE MINDS OF TRAVELLERS IN MOST INSTANCES THEY ARE ENTIRELY OF MODERN ORIGIN COINED AT THE SUGGESTION OF MISSIONARIES APPLIED TO THE WHITE MAN'S GOD
THE REALM OF PHANTOMS AND THEIR VICTORY OVER ITS LORDS ONE DEATH AND SEVEN DEATHS THE WRITER ADDS OF THE LATTER WHO CLEARLY REPRESENT TO HIS MIND THE EVIL ONE AND HIS ADJUTANTS IN THE OLD TIMES
HE FEELS WITHIN HIM SOMETHING THAT TELLS HIM THEY ARE NOT OF HIS KIND AND YET NOT ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM HIM HE SUMS THEM UP IN ONE WORD DRAWN FROM SENSUOUS EXPERIENCE DOES HE WISH TO EXPRESS STILL MORE FORCIBLY THIS SENTIMENT
BEING ALIKE TERMS AND NOTIONS OF FOREIGN IMPORTATION IF WE ACCEPT THE DEFINITION THAT MYTHOLOGY IS THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN SYMBOL FIGURE AND NARRATIVE AND ALWAYS STRUGGLING TOWARD A CLEARER UTTERANCE
HAS ITS ANTAGONIST PROVERB EACH BEING TRUE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT OR IN CERTAIN RELATIONS COULD WE CONCEIVE AN ABSTRACT INTELLECT WE MIGHT CONCEIVE IT DWELLING CONTINUALLY
BY THE ENVY AND INIQUITY OF THE PONTIFFS DOCTORS PRESBYTERS AND MONKS OF THE MOSAIC DISPENSATION FOR WITH GOOD RIGHT MAY HE IN THE GREEK TONGUE BE CALLED PAN SEEING THAT HE IS OUR ALL ALL WE ARE
AND THE CHARACTER WHEREIN IT HAS BEEN FOUNDED TAKING AWAY ALL TRUE GRANDEUR FROM JESUS BENUMBING OUR LOVE AND REVERENCE JESUS AS A MAN COMMANDS MY HEART'S BEST HOMAGE
BUT THE WORLD EVEN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNGRATEFUL TO ITS MOST GENEROUS BENEFACTORS IS IT NOT THE WORST OF SACRILEGE A FOUL PROFANATION OF OUR HUMAN NATURE
ALWAYS ALTERS YEAR AFTER YEAR AS MUCH AS THE MAN HIMSELF ALTERS FOR HE CONTINUES GRAFTING HIS OWN SENSE WHICH MAY BE DEPLORABLE NONSENSE UPON WORDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPOKEN
BETWEEN A HEAVEN ABOVE ITS DOMED FIRMAMENT AND A HADES LIKE A VAST DUNGEON BENEATH BUT A QUITE INFINITESIMAL GRAIN OF SAND INVOLVED BY AN INFINITESIMAL DROP OF DEW
AND THE REAL WE ACCEPT PERFORCE IN ITS FULNESS BUT DISCERN NOT HOW IT CAN DERIVE FROM AN UNREAL GOD NOVALIS IN HIS HYMNS TO THE NIGHT LAMENTS WITH SCHILLER
THE HEAVENLY TRINITY WOULD NOT HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THE SCHEME OF SALVATION BY ATONEMENT JUDAS CAIAPHAS
IN HIS INCOMPARABLE GODS IN EXILE HE TELLS US WHAT BECAME OF THESE DISPERSED OLYMPIANS DURING THE DARK AGES IN THE THICK NIGHT OF THE NOONTIDE OF CHRISTIANITY HOW THEY WERE TRANSFORMED FROM CELESTIAL TO INFERNAL
WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE WONDERFUL STORY RECOUNTED BY PLUTARCH IN HIS TREATISE ON THE CESSATION OF THE ORACLES HOW
JESUS AS A MAN WHOSE WORDS HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY FALLIBLE MEN IS NOT LOWERED IN MY ESTEEM BY SUCH CONTRADICTIONS AS I FIND BETWEEN HIS VARIOUS SPEECHES EVERY PROVERB
HAD HE LIVED IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A WISE MAN ONLY ATTACKS THE ERRORS THAT ARE IN HIS WAY THINGS WHICH HE NEVER MEETS HE CAN SCARCELY THINK OF AS OBSTRUCTIONS
JESUS ON HIS CROSS MUST DWINDLE TO A POINT EVEN IN THE REALMS OF LEGEND UNDER PROMETHEUS ON CAUCASUS FOR AGES ALREADY THE FATHER HAS BEEN AS SPECTRAL AS JUPITER
HAVE EVEN HAD THE HEART TO DEGRADE THIS FIRST PREACHER OF THE MOUNTAIN THE PUREST HERO OF LIBERTY FOR UNABLE TO DENY THAT HE WAS EARTH'S GREATEST MAN THEY HAVE MADE OF HIM HEAVEN'S SMALLEST GOD
THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS THINK HIM INSANE AND THEREFORE AS ORIENTALS HOLD HIM IN A CERTAIN REVERENCE
BY THE MONSTROUS SUPERSTITION OF THAT BALEFUL ERA AS WE FIND THE HOOFS AND HORNS OF PAN TRANSFERRED TO THE DEVIL HIMSELF AS WE FIND VENUS
IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT RESTORE MANKIND TO HIMSELF WITHOUT DYING AND WHAT GREAT THING WAS IT TO SEEM TO DIE FOR THREE DAYS HE SENT APOSTLES TO PREACH SALVATION TO ALL MEN
IS HIM IN HIM OF HIM BY HIM HE IS THE GOOD PAN THE GREAT SHEPHERD AT WHOSE DEATH WERE MOANINGS SIGHS TREPIDATIONS
ONE IS ASHAMED OF REPEATING THESE THINGS FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED OCCASIONALLY
HE CURED MANY SICK IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD HEALTH HE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS IF GOD WHY DID HE MAKE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS AT ALL
CONTESTS NOT THE JUSTICE OF THEIR DOOM WHILE IN THE FINAL CHORUS HE PREDICTS THE SAME DOOM FOR THEIR CONQUEROR IN HIS TURN IN OUR OWN DAY
I MUST AVOW THAT TO MY MIND THE DECOMPOSITION OF CHRISTIANITY IS SO OFFENSIVELY MANIFEST AND ADVANCED THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
WHAT DISCIPLE COULD BE EXPECTED TO REPORT PERFECTLY THE WORDS OF A TEACHER SO MYSTICALLY SUBLIME THE DISCIPLE INTENDS AND ENDEAVORS TO REPORT FAITHFULLY
THE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS BELIEF IN THIS ARE SHOCKED AT THE OUTRAGE OFFERED TO OUR HUMANITY BY THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY WHILE THEY THEMSELVES COMMIT THIS OUTRAGE MORE FLAGITIOUS LITTLE MATTERS WHENCE WE SPRANG
IT HAS BEEN OFTEN REMARKED THAT COPERNICUS AND KEPLER AND NEWTON HAVE DESTROYED ALL THE OLD MYTHOLOGIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE MYTHOLOGY OF BOTH THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS WITH THE EARTH NO LONGER THE UNIVERSE OF MORTAL LIFE
WE ARE SURELY AT THE UTMOST LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE IN CONCEIVING THAT JESUS COULD APPEAR UNTO FIVE HUNDRED OF THE BRETHREN AT ONCE THERE IS NO HINT ELSEWHERE THAT HE HAD SO MANY PERMANENT FOLLOWERS IN HIS LIFETIME
BUT WHEN HE HEARS WORDS WHICH TO HIM ARE WITHOUT SENSE BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS SOME TRUTH WHOSE SPHERE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS VISION HE MAKES SENSE OF THEM BY SOME SLIGHT CHANGE SLIGHT
THE POETS HAVE CHANTED THIS MOMENTOUS REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THEIR RELIGION THEIR PHANTASY OR THEIR MOOD MILTON IN HIS HYMN ON THE NATIVITY
SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE LEFT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE LEFT ARE THE TWO SAGES TO BE ACCOUNTED ANTAGONISTS NOW AS A WISE MAN IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE MEETS ERRORS OF MANY SORTS
RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF JESUS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN REVIEWING MISTER R H HUTTON'S ESSAY ON CHRISTIAN EVIDENCES POPULAR AND CRITICAL
AND AS THESE THREE MEN COULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DID IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GLORIOUS WORK WITHOUT A WELL KNOWN INSPIRATION A FOURTH MEMORIAL THE GRANDEST OF ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERECTED TO THE DEVIL
AND ELSEWHERE HAS BEWAILED THE DEAD IMMORTALS WITH NOTHING BUT AVERSION AND CONTEMPT FOR THE PALE GALILEAN THE GHASTLY GLORIES OF SAINTS DEAD LIMBS OF GIBBETED GODS
THE GOOD PANTAGRUEL GOES ON TO EXPOUND THE STORY AFTER HIS OWN MANNER THINKING THAT IT REFERRED NOT TO THE HEATHEN GOD PAN BUT TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST IGNOMINIOUSLY PUT TO DEATH
AS WE ARE LEARNING TO KNOW IT NOW TRY TO CONCEIVE AN INFINITE AND ETERNAL GOD OF THIS INFINITE AND ETERNAL WHOLE SACRIFICING HIS ONLY SON FOR THE SALVATION OF US MOST INSIGNIFICANT INSECTS
HE ACCEPTS THE JEWISH MIRACLES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME DOWN TO HIM THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OF HIS FOREFATHERS INVESTED WITH A GLAMOR OF SANCTITY AND HE REGARDS THEM WITH THE EYE OF FAITH WHICH SEES AND SEES NOT
I AM CONTENT TO NOTE ONE ASPECT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MYSTERY WHICH SO FAR AS I AM AWARE HAS BEEN SELDOM STUDIED THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT AS PLANNED BY GOD IS BASED UPON A CRIME
IT IS FULL TIME TO PROCLAIM THE DEATH OF THE GREAT GOD CHRIST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS MAKE A FAIRLY LONG PERIOD EVEN FOR A CELESTIAL DYNASTY BUT THIS ONE IN ITS PERISHING
NAY WHAT BIBLIOLATER HAS EVER SERIOUSLY WEIGHED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE MIRACLES OF HIS FELLOW CHRISTIAN THE GREAT SAINT BERNARD SUCH AS THOSE WHICH ARE MINUTELY RELATED AND SOLEMNLY ATTESTED BY TEN EYE WITNESSES
AND SINCE HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO WEIGH EVIDENCE BEFORE EITHER ACCEPTING OR REJECTING THOUGH HE MAY SEEK EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT TO CONFIRM WHAT HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIMSELF TO BELIEVE
AND WHEN THE REPORTS ARE NOT PUT INTO WRITING UNTIL MANY YEARS AFTER THE WORDS WERE FIRST UTTERED THE CHANGES WILL BE IMPORTANT EVEN AS TO THE LETTER FOR A NARRATIVE
AND THE WHOLE OF JERUSALEM AND COMPEL THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BEAR ENDURING WITNESS TO HIS RESURRECTION WHY DID HE NOT SUMMON ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST TO THE SOLEMN SPECTACLE OF HIS ASCENSION
THIS WORLD AND LIFE WERE CONTEMNED FOR THE LIFE AND WORLD TO COME NATURE THE ALL THE GREAT PAN WAS ANNULLED AND THE SUPERNATURAL NOTHING THRONED SUPREME
THEIR CHRIST STANDING IN THE FLESH ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES FLOATED UP THROUGH THIS VAULT TO SIT ENTHRONED BESIDE HIS FATHER IN THE MOST NATURAL SUPERNATURAL MANNER
HAVE PERHAPS BEEN DEGRADED BY THE REPORTER
WHY DID HE LET ANY REMAIN POOR AND IGNORANT HE REBUKED THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES IT GOD WHY DID HE NOT WHOLLY PURIFY THEM FROM FORMALISM HYPOCRISY AND UNBELIEF
WE FIND THAT THERE WERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GATHERED AFTER THE ASCENSION WITHOUT THE PRIESTS AND THE ROMAN OFFICIALS HEARING OF THE APPARITION AND INVESTIGATING IT
CONFIDENT THAT TO NOT ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS COULD THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST GIVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SATISFACTORY ANSWER AS THE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT IS PRESENTED TO US GOD SACRIFICED HIS ONLY SON
WHEN THE NOBLEST HEARTS WORSHIP NOT AT ITS ALTARS WHEN THE MOST VIGOROUS INTELLECTS ABANDON ITS CREEDS THE KNELL OF ITS DOOM HAS RUNG AT THE RISK OF BEING THOUGHT BIGOTED OR PREJUDICED
AND AT INCONCEIVABLE DISTANCES FROM IT WITH MAN NO LONGER THE LORD OF THE CREATION FOR WHOSE SERVICE ALL THINGS WERE MADE BUT AN ANIMALCULE INEXPRESSIBLY SMALL LIVING FOR A MOMENT INEXPRESSIBLY BRIEF
SHOUTS HARSH PURITANICAL SCORN ON THE ORACLES STRICKEN DUMB AND THE DEITIES OVERTHROWN SHELLEY IN A MAGNIFICENT CHORUS OF HELLAS
HE PREACHED THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT BRING THE KINGDOM WITH HIM AND MAKE ALL MANKIND FIT FOR IT HE LOVED THE POOR HE TAUGHT THE IGNORANT IF GOD
AS TO THE LETTER IMMENSE AS TO THE SPIRIT FOR THE SENSE IS A TRUTH OR TRUISM OF HIS OWN LOWER SPHERE
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT NEITHER IN THE ACTS NOR IN THE EPISTLES IS THERE ANY ALLUSION TO THESE RESURRECTIONS WHEN PETER AND THE OTHERS WERE PREACHING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
WHEN A LOUD AND TERRIBLE VOICE FROM THE LAND CALLED THAMOUS THE PILOT AND HE HAVING RESPONDED AT THE THIRD APPEAL
HE IS ROLLING OFF ON THE RIGHT YOU PUSH HIM UP HE THEN ROLLS OVER ON THE LEFT EXACTLY SO AND BECAUSE ONE SAGE SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE RIGHT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE RIGHT WHILE ANOTHER SAGE
THIS PRODIGAL MULTIPLICITY AND SUPERFLUITY OF RESURRECTIONS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO MODERN CHRISTIAN CHAMPIONS THOUGH DOUBTLESS IT DID NOT IN THE LEAST TROUBLE THE PRIMITIVE NON SCIENTIFIC BELIEVERS
LIVES IN THE RELATIVE AND THE CONDITIONED AND NATURALLY REFLECTS THE CHARACTER OF THIS SPHERE THE WISE MAN FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED AND OBSTRUCTED BY CERTAIN CONCRETE ERRORS
AND WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM EVEN PETER WON'T DENY HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAS RESTORED PETER'S MOTHER IN LAW TO LIFE THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE
THE VOICE GROWN YET LOUDER AND MORE TERRIBLE
WHOSE VISIBLE TANGIBLE LIVING AND SPEAKING EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT MISGIVING BY THE NON SCIENTIFIC EARLY CHRISTIANS
ONLY FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT ITSELF I CONFINED MYSELF TO SHOWING OR ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT SUCH EVIDENCE IS UNSUBSTANTIAL BUT I COULD NOT CONSIDER THIS ARGUMENT ADEQUATE OR CONCLUSIVE
IF JESUS HAD ASCENDED AND CONTINUED TO ASCEND WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT HE MIGHT BE ASCENDING NOW
AND LAMENTATIONS IN ALL THE MACHINE OF THE UNIVERSE HEAVENS EARTH SEA HELLS WITH THIS MY INTERPRETATION THE TIME AGREES FOR THAT MOST GOOD
BUT PAN THE GREAT LIVES AGAIN AS MISTER MACCALL TOLD US IN SOME LINES PUBLISHED IN THIS PAPER SEVERAL YEARS AGO PAN LIVES NOT AS A GOD BUT AS THE ALL NATURE
WERE RECORDED OF ANY OTHER THAN JESUS IN ANY OTHER SACRED BOOK THAN THE BIBLE MISTER HUTTON AND ALL OTHER INTELLIGENT CHRISTIANS WOULD NOT ONLY DISBELIEVE IT BUT WOULD NOT EVEN CONDESCEND TO INVESTIGATE IT
I HAVE A VISION OF THE GOD MAN GETTING OLD UPON THE EARTH HORRIBLY ANXIOUS AND WRETCHED BECAUSE NO ONE WILL MURDER HIM JUDAS HAS SUCCEEDED TO A LARGE PROPERTY AND WOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO BETRAY HIM BY THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF SILVER
AND WHO THOUGH VALIANTLY DEFYING SCIENCE SEEKS TO CONCILIATE HISTORICAL POSSIBILITY FINDS HIS TASK QUITE HEAVY ENOUGH IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACTS
HOW CAN OUR HUMANITY IMITATE DEITY AND FINALLY A QUESTION TRAMPLING DOWN EVERY ASSERTION IN HIS FAVOR
HIS WORDS AS REPORTED BY THE EVANGELISTS ARE EVER FLOWING FOUNTAINS OF SPIRITUAL REFRESHMENTS AND I FEEL THAT HE WAS IN HIMSELF EVEN FAR MORE WISE AND GOOD THAN HE APPEARS IN THE GOSPEL
MOST GREAT PAN OUR ONLY SAVIOR DIED AT JERUSALEM REIGNING IN ROME TIBERIUS CAESAR PANTAGRUEL THESE WORDS SAID RESTED IN SILENCE AND PROFOUND CONTEMPLATION
YOUR ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT SIMPLY SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AT ALL SUCH STORIES AND SAYS WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE OF COURSE MERE IMPOSTURE AND COLLUSION OR SUPERSTITION AND DELUSION
WE CAN CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THIS SIMPLE FAITH BUT IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THE BLIND FAITH WHICH SEEMS WILFULLY BLIND
I CAN NO LONGER GIVE MY ESTEEM TO ANY EDUCATED MAN WHO HAS INVESTIGATED AND STILL PROFESSES THIS RELIGION WITHOUT GRAVE DEDUCTION AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS HEART HIS INTELLECT OR HIS CONSCIENCE
SECURING MULTITUDINOUS AND PERMANENTLY RECORDED EVIDENCE SUCH AS NONE OF US COULD DOUBT WE MIGHT GO ON ASKING WHY AND WHY AND WHY IN THIS FASHION ON A HUNDRED POINTS
WHEN WE FIND SENTENCES OF THE PUREST BEAUTY AND WISDOM IN THE RECORDS OF A MAN'S CONVERSATION WE MAY SAFELY PROPORTION THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL CHARACTER OF THE SPEAKER TO SUCH SENTENCES THEY MARK THE ALTITUDE
CONDEMNING IT OFFHAND AS TOO PREPOSTEROUS TO BE WORTHY OF SERIOUS ATTENTION THUS WHAT CHRISTIAN HAS EVER DEIGNED TO EXAMINE CRITICALLY THE MARVELS AFFIRMED IN THE KORAN SUCH AS MOHAMMED'S VISIT TO HEAVEN
FATE IN THE FORM OF SCIENCE HAS DECREED THE EXTINCTION OF THE GODS MARY AND HER BABE MUST JOIN VENUS AND LOVE ISIS AND HORUS LIVING WITH THEM ONLY IN THE WORLD OF ART
MAY HE BE COMPELLED TO COMMIT SUICIDE MUST HE GO BACK TO HEAVEN UNSACRIFICED FOILED FOR WANT OF AN ASSASSIN BENJAMIN DISRAELI ATTAINED THE CYNICAL SUBLIME WHEN HE SUGGESTED
TO A HISTORY WHOSE CHRONOLOGY COUNTS NOT SIX THOUSAND YEARS BUT AS I HAVE REMARKED EVEN THIS MINUTE FIELD THEY CANNOT HOLD AGAINST THE SCEPTIC WHO HAS MADE THEM ABANDON ALL THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE
AND DEITY REPORTS THE SPEECHES ALL SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE TRUTH TRANSPARENTLY SELF CONSISTENT ELSE WHAT ADVANTAGE OR GAIN HAVE WE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF GOD FOR MAN
IS HENPECKED AND SUPERSTITIOUS
IF ALL THESE TURPITUDES HAD NOT BEEN SECURED THE ATONEMENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED NEED ONE SAY MORE SOMETIMES WHEN MUSING UPON THIS DOCTRINE
AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHICH SLEPT AROSE AND CAME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY
WHILE REJECTING WITHOUT QUESTION ALL OTHERS WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT CANNOT BE BECAUSE OF ANY SUPERIORITY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FORMER SINCE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE LATTER IS IN MANY CASES INFINITELY GREATER AND BETTER AUTHENTICATED
GODS OF GREECE AFTER DECLARING IN HIS WILD WAY THAT HE HAS NEVER LOVED THE OLD DEITIES THAT TO HIM THE GREEK ARE REPUGNANT AND THE ROMANS THOROUGHLY HATEFUL YET
ONCE IN THE IMPERIAL ARCHIVES THE RECORD OF THE MIRACLE WOULD HAVE SPREAD EVERYWHERE ALL SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS WOULD HAVE RELATED IT ALL SUBSEQUENT WRITERS REFERRED TO IT SO IT IS NO WONDER THAT
NOW THAT THE OPPRESSION OF THE SUPERNATURAL IS REMOVED I MAY BE TOLD THAT CHRISTIANITY IS YET ALIVE AND FLOURISHING THAT ITS PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHURCHES HOLD POSSESSION OF EUROPE AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA
THE UNSOULING OF NATURE BOUND IN IRON CHAINS BY ARID NUMBER AND RIGOROUS RULE BUT GOES ON TO CELEBRATE THE RESURRECTION OF HUMANITY IN CHRIST
THE CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY AND SYSTEM AMONG OTHERS BECAUSE INEFFABLY ABSURD WHERE IS THE HEAVEN FOR ITS GOD WHERE THE HELL FOR ITS DEVIL WHERE IS ABOVE WHERE BENEATH
THAT PAN THE GREAT WAS DEAD ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE VESSEL REACHED THIS PLACE
NATURALLY THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS HATED AND RESISTED SCIENCE AND THE THEOLOGIANS HAVE SELDOM DARED TO FACE ITS CONCLUSIONS THEY IGNORE THE IMMENSITIES AND CONFINE THEIR VISION TO THE PAGES OF A SINGLE BOOK
TO WHOM NOTHING WAS MORE NATURAL THAN THE UNNATURAL INCLUDING THE SUPERNATURAL AND THE INFRANATURAL AN APOLOGIST OF OUR DAYS WHO MUST AFFIRM THE ONE RESURRECTION SEEING THAT HIS WHOLE RELIGION IS BASED UPON IT
BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT OF HIS DEEPEST REGRETS THE BANISHED DIVINITIES AND SINCE THE HALLS OF OLYMPUS ARE VOID APPEALS TO NATURE TO RESTORE TO HIS SPIRIT ITS FIRST FIRE IF SHE INDEED LIVES
AT WHICH HIS SPIRIT LOVED TO DWELL WE ARE BUT COMPLETING THE CIRCLE FROM THE CLEAREST FRAGMENT ARC LEFT
WE DON'T THINK TWICE BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER THE IMPOSSIBLE EVER REALLY OCCURRED HOW THEN CAN THIS ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT RECEIVE WITHOUT QUESTION THE MIRACLES OF THE JEWISH BOOKS
MIRACULOUSLY ANNOUNCED WAS THE PAN OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS CHRIST HAD DIED BUT ONLY PRO TEM HAD DESCENDED INTO HELL BUT WITH A RETURN TICKET
YET THE ORTHODOX SHUDDER AND MOAN OUTRAGED IN THEIR PIOUS SENSIBILITIES WHEN ONE DARES TO SPEAK WITH MANLY PLAINNESS OF THEIR DOCTRINES WHICH COMMENCE BY POLLUTING OUR COMMON NATURE
WHY DID THEIR RISEN LORD ONLY SLINK ABOUT AMONG HIS OWN DISCIPLES APPEARING TO THESE BUT AT FLYING INSTANTS WHY DID HE NOT WITH HIS WELL KNOWN FEATURES AND WITH THE WOUNDS OF THE NAILS AND THE SPEAR IN HIS BODY
FOR THERE ARE LARGE GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF INCOMPARABLY GREATER IMPORTANCE WHICH IT LEAVES OUT ALTOGETHER IT IS AS IF A CASE RULED BY BROAD PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY WERE TO BE DECIDED ON THE NARROWEST TECHNICAL GROUNDS
IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT REVEAL IT AT ONCE TO ALL MEN AND SO REVEAL IT THAT DOUBT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HE LIVED AN EXAMPLE OF HOLINESS TO US ALL IF GOD
IT ASSERTS THAT HUMAN NATURE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SO GOOD AS JESUS THAT HUMAN GENIUS COULD NOT POSSIBLY WRITE THE BOOKS WHICH TELL OF HIM IT DENIES US OUR NOBLEST PREROGATIVES
IS NO MORE ALIVE THAN PLUTO WHO ALSO WAS BORN BROTHER TO THE MONARCH OF HEAVEN THE HEBREW DYNASTY OF THE GODS IS NO MORE IT HAS DONE MUCH EVIL IN ITS LONG SOVRANTY
FOR AGES ALREADY THE HOLY GHOST HAS BEEN BUT THE SHADOW OF A SHADE AND THE LAST NOT LEAST MEMBER OF THE DIVINE ROYAL FAMILY SATAN THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
HE FEELS READY TO FIGHT FOR THE FORMER AGAINST THESE THIS CHANGE OF THE CELESTIAL DYNASTY IS INDEED A FAVORITE THEME WITH HIM ELSEWHERE HE PICTURES THE OLYMPIANS HOLDING HIGH REVELRY
TO WHOM MIRACLES APPEARED AMONG THE MOST FREQUENT OCCURRENCES OF LIFE SO COULD THE ASCENSION THEIR EARTH WAS A PLANE VAULTED BY THE SKY LAMPED BY THE LITTLE SUN AND MOON AND STARS
A VERY FEW PERSONS WHOSE TRANSCENDENT GENIUS COULD THROW A GLAMOR OF GLORY OVER ANY CREED HOWEVER CRUDE AND MEAN AND WHOM I RECOGNISE AS FAR ABOVE MY JUDGMENT
THEREFORE WHILE CONFIDENT THAT EVEN ON THESE GROUNDS THE CASE MUST GO AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN BELIEVER I WISH TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON ITS WIDER RELATIONS IN ORDER THAT THE DECISION MAY BE ESTABLISHED
WHY BRING IN GOD TO UTTER AND RECORD WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AS WELL UTTERED AND RECORDED BY MAN EVERYTHING FOR WHICH WE LOVE AND VENERATE THE MAN JESUS BECOMES A BITTER AND ABSURD MOCKERY WHEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE LORD CHRIST
WHICH WE WILL TRY TO FORGET NOW IT CEASES TO REIGN IT HAS DONE SOME LITTLE GOOD WHOSE REMEMBRANCE WE WILL CHERISH WHEN IT IS SEPULCHRED CHRIST THE GREAT IS DEAD
AND MY DEEP REVERENCE FOR RABELAIS WITH WHOM NO COMMENTATOR IN HOLY ORDERS KNOWN TO ME CAN BE COMPARED EXCEPT DEAN SWIFT I AM INCLINED ON THIS POINT TO FOLLOW THE ORDINARY OPINION THAT PAN THE GREAT GOD WHOSE DEATH WAS THUS
HIS BROW BLEEDING FROM A CROWN OF THORNS TRAILING ON HIS SHOULDER A HEAVY CROSS WHICH HE HEAVES UPON THE BANQUET TABLE AND FORTHWITH THE REVEL IS NO MORE
WE ARE WHAT WE ARE BUT MUCH MATTERS TO WHAT WE MAY ATTAIN IF THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY PLANTS OUR FEET IN THE SLIME THE CHRISTIAN THEORY BOWS OUR HEAD TO THE DUST
JESUS AS GOD
THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WERE OFF AGAIN
BID THE PRINCESS TO DRINK A LITTLE OF THE WINE IT IS STRONG AND WILL IMMEDIATELY SEND HER INTO A DEEP SLEEP THEN WHILE SHE IS ASLEEP HEAT THE SHOVEL AND MARK HER BACK WITH IT
THE PRINCE SHOULD BE BANISHED FROM THE COUNTRY THIS WAS FINALLY AGREED TO ACCORDINGLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A LITTLE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ESCORTED THE PRINCE OUT OF THE CITY
AND INFORM HIM OF EVERYTHING ACCORDINGLY THEY DID THIS THE PRINCE WROTE THE LETTER
THEY ALSO SHALL GO OUT BY THIS DOOR I HAVE A CHARM WHEREBY I CAN MAKE THEM THIN OR FAT SO THE VIZIER'S SON FETCHED THE HORSES WITHOUT ANY PERSON KNOWING IT
ASSEMBLED AND MARCHED BY THE HOUSE OF THE MERCHANT BY CHANCE FOR THEY BOTH HAD BEEN EXCUSED FROM OBEYING THIS ORDER THE KING'S SON
DISCIPLE AND SERVANT IN THE MORNING
DRESSED AS A PRINCESS
I SUPPOSE THE ARROW STRUCK THE MERCHANT'S WIFE HAD I KNOWN THAT SHE OR ANYBODY HAD BEEN NEAR
OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT WILDLY THANK GOD EXCLAIMED
THAT A CERTAIN POISON WAS TO BE MIXED INTO IT WHILE COOKING AND AS SOON AS IT WAS READY THE COVER WAS TO BE PLACED ON THE SAUCEPAN SO THAT THE POISONOUS STEAM MIGHT NOT ESCAPE
THE KING WISHED BOTH OF THEM TO BE EXECUTED
STAYING IN HER HOUSE BUT THE SIGHT OF A MUHR WHICH THE PRINCE DROPPED IN THE BOTTOM OF A CUP IN WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN HIM WATER AND A PRESENT OF ANOTHER MUHR
RETURNED AND FOUND THE FIRE LIGHTED THE HORSES SECURELY FASTENED
THE PRINCE GAVE A DEEP SIGH THE VIZIER'S SON LOOKED AS MUCH AS TO SAY KEEP QUIET OR YOU'LL DISCOVER THE SECRET IS THERE A KING OF THIS COUNTRY
HE AT ONCE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND LAID HOLD OF THE HALTER OF ONE OF THE OTHER HORSES AND THEN BECKONING TO THE PRINCE TO DO LIKEWISE HE RODE OFF THE PRINCE
SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY AND IN A MOMENT WAS RIDING AFTER HIM HAVING THE WOMAN BEHIND HIM NOW THE ROBBERS HEARD THE GALLOPING OF THE HORSES AND RAN OUT AND SHOT THEIR ARROWS
WERE ALSO IN THE COMPANY AND PASSED BY IN THE CROWD THEY CAME TO SEE THE TAMASHA AS SOON AS THESE TWO APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE MERCHANT'S WINDOW THEY WERE RECOGNISED
AND ORDERED HER TO RUSH INTO THE ROOM WHILE SHE WAS CONVERSING WITH THE OLD WOMAN AND IF THE OLD WOMAN ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
MOST GLADLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND RECEIVED A RIGHT NOBLE WELCOME FROM THE KING
AND THE SERVANTS CAME RUNNING UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER IT HAPPENED THAT THE WOMAN HAD FAINTED AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY A VERY SLIGHT WOUND IN HER BREAST WHERE THE ARROW HAD GRAZED
FEAR NOT MY BROTHER BUT GO AND TAKE THIS NECKLACE AND TRY TO SELL IT IN THE BAZAAR THE PRINCE TOOK IT TO A GOLDSMITH AND ASKED HIM TO BUY IT HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT ASKED THE MAN
I WILL JUMP DOWN AND RECONNOITRE YOU STAY HERE AND WAIT TILL I RETURN PRESENTLY HE CAME BACK AND TOLD THE PRINCE THAT HE HAD SEEN A MOST UGLY WOMAN
AND AT ONCE ORDERED THE PRINCESS'S BACK TO BE EXAMINED IT IS SO SAID THE MAID SERVANT THE BURN IS THERE THEN LET THE GIRL BE SLAIN IMMEDIATELY THE KING SHOUTED NO NO YOUR MAJESTY THEY REPLIED
WITH THEIR VALUABLE BURDENS ON REACHING A PLACE ON THE BORDERS OF THE KING'S DOMINIONS THE PRINCE GAVE THE SOLDIERS SOME GOLD AND ORDERED THEM TO RETURN THE SOLDIERS TOOK THE MONEY AND LEFT
WHEN THE PILAW WAS READY SHE SENT IT AT ONCE
IMPATIENT AND ROSE UP AND WALKED ABOUT HE SAW A PRETTY CLEAR LITTLE BROOK RUNNING ALONG NOT FAR FROM THEIR RESTING PLACE AND HEARING THAT ITS SOURCE WAS NOT FAR DISTANT HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IT
QUICKLY MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND SHE AGREED TO LET THEM STAY THERE FOR A FEW DAYS AS SOON AS HER WORK WAS OVER THE OLD WOMAN CAME AND SAT DOWN WITH HER LODGERS
IF SHE EVER AGAIN SPOKE OF THE STRANGERS BEFORE HER IN THE EVENING WHEN THE OLD WOMAN HAD RETURNED TO HER HUT SHE TOLD THE VIZIER'S SON HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BREAKING HER PROMISE
WENT TO THE BANIYA AND THE BAKER AND THE BUTCHER TO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR DINNER FOR SOME REASON HE WAS DELAYED PERHAPS THE TSUT WAS NOT QUITE READY OR THE BANIYA
NEVER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUDDENLY ESTRANGE YOU FROM ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO
FIFTY THOUSAND RUPEES THE PRINCE REPLIED ALL RIGHT SAID THE MAN WAIT HERE WHILE I GO AND FETCH THE MONEY THE PRINCE WAITED AND WAITED
SHOWED THE PRINCESS SOME OF THE POISONED PILAW THAT SHE HAD SENT HIM
AT THE PRINCE AND HIS COMPANIONS AND ONE OF THE ARROWS KILLED THE WOMAN SO THEY HAD TO LEAVE HER BEHIND ON ON THEY RODE UNTIL THEY REACHED A VILLAGE WHERE THEY STAYED THE NIGHT
WHEN THEY REACHED THE LAST CUSTOM HOUSE THE VIZIER'S SON OVERTOOK THEM HE HAD COME WITH ALL HASTE BRINGING WITH HIM FOUR BAGS OF MUHRS ON FOUR HORSES I AM COME HE SAID
SHALL BE ACCEPTED BY THE KING HER FATHER AND ALL THE COURT THE PRINCE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING AS THE VIZIER'S SON HAD ADVISED HIM AND HE KEPT HIS PROMISE THE FOLLOWING NIGHT ON THE RETURN OF THE PRINCE
WE SHALL SEE THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ONE MORNING THE TWO TRAVELLERS NOTICED THE OLD WOMAN'S MOST CAREFUL TOILETTE HOW CAREFUL SHE WAS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HER HAIR AND THE SET OF HER
AND HOW THE PRINCESS HAD STRUCK HER BECAUSE SHE MENTIONED THEIR COMING AND ALL ABOUT THEM
KASABAH AND PUTS WHO IS COMING
THESE THINGS ARE SIGNS
BY A SECRET DOOR BUT WHERE ARE THE HORSES AND THE GOODS
THERE HE CAME ACROSS THE FOOTMARKS OF HIS FRIEND SEEING THESE HE WENT BACK AT ONCE FOR THE MONEY AND THE HORSES AND BRINGING THEM WITH HIM HE TRACKED THE PRINCE TO THE LAKE
THESE TWO MEN BELONGED TO A FAMILY OF ROBBERS THERE WERE ELEVEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER ONE AN ELDER SISTER STAYED AT HOME AND COOKED THE FOOD AND THE OTHER TEN ALL BROTHERS
REMEMBERED HIM ACCORDINGLY HE SENT BACK HIS SALAM AND EXPRESSIONS OF THANKFULNESS WHEN IT WAS DINNER TIME HE TOOK THE SAUCEPAN OF PILAW
EXCLAIMED THE KING WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT WHAT EXAMPLES FOR THE PEOPLE LET THEM BOTH BE EXECUTED NOT SO YOUR MAJESTY
THOUGHT THAT THE PRINCE HAD SPOKEN GRATEFULLY OF HIM TO THE PRINCESS
AND PROMISED THAT THEY EACH WOULD GIVE HIM A DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE HE AGREED TO DO SO AND SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THEIR PARDON THEN THE PRINCE
I SEE HER AND THE PRINCESS EVERY DAY I SHOULD HAVE GONE YESTERDAY IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN HERE AND TAKEN UP ALL MY TIME
FEARING LEST THE ELEPHANTS SHOULD GO AND PUSH DOWN HER HUT AND KILL THE PRINCE AND HIS FRIEND BEGGED THE PRINCESS TO LET HER DEPART
FAIRY HE LOOKED ROUND HOPING TO SEE THE REALITY BUT SEEING NO PERSON HE DRANK THE WATER AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE SOME MORE AGAIN HE SAW THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER WHICH WAS IN HIS PALM
HAD NOT GOT ALL THE SPICES PREPARED AFTER WAITING
BUT NO PRINCE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK HE WAITED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SHOUTED
THAT BELONGED TO AN OLD WOMAN FROM WHOM THEY FEARED NO HARM AND WITH WHOM THEREFORE THEY COULD ABIDE IN PEACE AND COMFORT AT FIRST THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF THESE TRAVELLERS
AND REPEATING THE CHARM HE MADE THEM PASS THROUGH THE NARROW DOORWAY LIKE PIECES OF CLOTH AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL OUTSIDE RESTORED THEM
AND THE NAME OF THE QUEEN THE VIZIER'S SON INTERRUPTED THE OLD WOMAN BY TURNING TO LOOK AT THE PRINCE WHO WAS STARING LIKE A MADMAN YES HE SAID TO HIM AFTERWARDS WE ARE IN THE RIGHT COUNTRY
AND THE VIZIER'S SON ATTENDED BY A TROOP OF SOLDIERS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF CAMELS AND HORSES BEARING VERY MUCH TREASURE LEFT FOR THEIR OWN LAND
THEN I FAINTED OH IF YOU CAN GET ME THAT FAIRY FOR MY WIFE I WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU OH BROTHER
PRETENDED TO BE UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE HAS THIS CITY A NAME HE ASKED THE OLD WOMAN OF COURSE IT HAS YOU STUPID EVERY LITTLE VILLAGE MUCH MORE A CITY
NOBODY THE OLD WOMAN REPLIED
WHERE HE FOUND HIM LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE DEAD ALAS ALAS HE CRIED AND LIFTING UP THE PRINCE HE POURED SOME WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE ALAS
CALL THE KING HITHER HE REPLIED AND THEN I WILL TELL HIS MAJESTY FACE TO FACE ON THIS SOME MEN WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM
THE MOMENT THE CROWS ATE WHAT WAS THROWN TO THEM THEY FELL DOWN DEAD HEAVEN BE PRAISED EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON WHO HAS PRESERVED ME FROM DEATH AT THIS TIME ON THE RETURN OF THE PRINCE THAT EVENING
BEGGED THEM TO COME AND STAY AT THEIR HOUSE FOR THE NIGHT IT IS LATE THEY SAID AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER VILLAGE WITHIN SEVERAL MILES SHALL WE ACCEPT THIS GOOD MAN'S INVITATION BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE
THIS DONE RETURN NOW FEAR NOT TO EXECUTE THESE INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE ON THE FULFILMENT OF THEM DEPENDS YOUR FORTUNE AND HAPPINESS I WILL ARRANGE THAT YOUR MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCESS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS CONVERSATION SHE ORDERED ONE OF HER MAIDS TO MAKE A PILAW
THEY RAZED IT TO THE GROUND SLEW ALL ITS INMATES AND SEIZED THE TREASURE WHICH THEY HAD BEEN AMASSING THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WHEN THE KING SAW HIS SON'S BEAUTIFUL WIFE
ONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY APPEARS VERY STUPID HE ASKED ME THE NAME OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE NAME OF THE KING NOW WHERE CAN THESE MEN HAVE COME FROM THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THESE THINGS HOWEVER
AS SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW ON HEARING THIS THE MERCHANT WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HIS MAJESTY WAS MUCH ENRAGED AT SUCH AUDACIOUS WICKEDNESS
AND SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT YOU SO THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED ALONG HAND IN HAND AS FAST AS THEY COULD TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND BEHIND THEM MARCHED THE SOLDIERS AND THE HORSES
DICTATION ON READING THE LETTER
WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS HE FELT MUCH COMFORTED ROSE UP AND ATE AND THEN WENT AWAY GLADLY WITH HIS FRIEND ON THE WAY THEY MET TWO MEN
AND BE KEPT NEAR THE GRAVE WHENCE SHE TOOK OUT THE CORPSE SAID THE FAKIR THIS WAS DONE AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE AND THE PRINCESS
WHY YOU ARE CRYING TELL HER THAT YOU WEEP FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR FRIEND WHO DIED SUDDENLY THIS MORNING LOOK TAKE TOO THIS WINE AND THIS SHOVEL AND WHEN YOU HAVE FEIGNED INTENSE GRIEF AT THE DEATH OF YOUR FRIEND
THEY DID NOT HOWEVER GO VERY FAR BUT HID THEMSELVES BEHIND ROCKS AND STONES AND WAITED TILL THEY WERE QUITE SURE THAT THE PRINCE DID NOT INTEND TO COME BACK ON AND ON THE EXILES WALKED
EXAMINE YOUR DAUGHTER
BURN ON HER BACK GO AND IF IT IS AS I SAY SEND THE PRINCESS TO ME AND I WILL PUNISH HER
HIS MAJESTY CAME AND SEEING THE FAKIR SO SOLEMN AND EARNEST IN HIS DEVOTIONS HE WAS AFRAID TO ROUSE HIS ANGER LEST PERADVENTURE THE DISPLEASURE OF HEAVEN SHOULD DESCEND ON HIM AND SO HE PLACED HIS HANDS TOGETHER
BY THE MERCHANT'S WIFE AND AT ONCE REPORTED TO THE KING
AND DEPRESSED THE PRINCE NOTICED THIS CHANGE IN HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE REASON IS IT BECAUSE I AM AWAY SO MUCH AT THE PALACE
AFTER THIS THE OLD WOMAN WENT AND REPEATED ALMOST THE SAME WORDS TO THE PRINCESS ON THE HEARING OF WHICH THE PRINCESS BEAT HER SEVERELY AND THREATENED HER WITH A SEVERER PUNISHMENT
I AM GOING TO SEE MY DAUGHTER
THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY LEFT THE VIZIERS AND OTHERS WHOM THE KING INTENDED TO HAVE EXECUTED AS SOON AS HIS VISITORS HAD LEFT
HAD OBTAINED A CHARMED SWING THAT LANDED WHOEVER SAT ON IT AT THE PLACE WHEREVER THEY WISHED TO BE GET THE SWING SHE SAID TO ONE OF THE SERVANTS STANDING BY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT SHE BADE THE OLD WOMAN
LET US SEND HER TO THE FAKIR WHO DISCOVERED THIS THING THAT HE MAY DO WHATEVER HE WISHES WITH HER THE KING AGREED AND SO THE PRINCESS WAS TAKEN TO THE GRAVEYARD LET HER BE SHUT UP IN A CAGE
WITHIN HALF A YARD OF HER HEAD SUPPOSING THAT SHE WAS DEAD HE RUSHED TO THE WINDOW AND SHRIEKED THIEVES THIEVES THEY HAVE KILLED MY WIFE THE NEIGHBOURS QUICKLY GATHERED
A ROYAL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED TO THIS EFFECT SO THE NEXT DAY ALL THE MEN AND BOYS OF THE CITY FROM THE AGE OF TEN YEARS UPWARDS
CHAFFING HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MISSED THE BIRD PRESENTLY THE MERCHANT WENT TO ASK HIS WIFE ABOUT SOMETHING AND FOUND HER LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE
THE PRINCESS WEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS HER GREATEST HELPER AND FRIEND A LETTER WAS SENT TO THE CHIEF VIZIER TELLING HIM OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PRINCE
IN THE ATTITUDE OF A SUPPLICANT AND ASKED HOW DID YOU GET MY DAUGHTER'S NECKLACE LAST NIGHT REPLIED THE FAKIR WE WERE SITTING HERE BY THIS TOMB WORSHIPPING KHUDA
ABOUT US IN THE HEARING OF THE PRINCESS
BUT THE PRINCE WAS TIRED AND THINKING THAT IT WAS ONLY A WHIM OF HIS FRIEND'S HE SAID TO THE MEN VERY WELL IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO ASK US SO THEY ALL FOUR WENT TO THE ROBBERS TOWER
THEY ARE VERY GREAT AND VERY RICH
TOOK UP SOME OF THE WATER IN HIS HAND FORTUNATELY HE LOOKED INTO HIS HAND BEFORE DRINKING AND THERE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT HE SAW REFLECTED WHOLE AND CLEAR THE IMAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL
I WILL CAUSE ALL THE MALE INHABITANTS OF THIS CITY TO PASS BEFORE YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR WIFE WILL STAND AT THE WINDOW AND WATCH FOR THE MAN WHO DID THIS WANTON DEED
WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS CRUEL THING I SHOT AN ARROW AT A BIRD THAT WAS SITTING ON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN YONDER HOUSE AND MISSED ANSWERED THE PRINCE
THE KING GAVE THEM PRESENTS OF HORSES AND ELEPHANTS AND JEWELS AND RICH CLOTHS AND BADE THEM START FOR THEIR OWN LAND FOR HE WAS SURE THAT THE KING WOULD NOW RECEIVE THEM
REMEMBER TO BRING BACK THE SHOVEL AGAIN
LET THE FACTS OF THE CASE BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED HOW IS IT
RUBBED SOME OINTMENT OVER THE SCARS ON HER BACK AND THEN SAT HER UPON ONE OF THEIR HORSES BEHIND THE PRINCE AWAY THEY RODE FAST AND FAR AND BY THE MORNING
SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THE VIZIER READ THE LETTER HE WENT AND INFORMED THE KING THE KING CAUSED A REPLY TO BE SENT TO THE TWO EXILES IN WHICH HE ORDERED THEM NOT TO RETURN
EVER BEEN BEFORE HENCEFORTH THE PRINCE VISITED
THE SOURCE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LAKE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS COVERED WITH THE MAGNIFICENT LOTUS FLOWER AND OTHER WATER PLANTS THE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON THE BANK AND BEING THIRSTY
HAVE TAKEN UP THEIR ABODE IN MY HUT AND DEMAND SO MUCH OF MY ATTENTION IT IS NOTHING BUT COOKING AND CLEANING AND CLEANING AND COOKING ALL DAY LONG I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE MEN SHE ADDED
OF COURSE THERE IS AND A QUEEN AND A PRINCESS WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES
OR SICKNESS ATTACK HIM AND THEN SHE WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF HIM SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT SEEING HIM THE PRINCE SHOWED HER THAT THERE WAS NO REAL CAUSE FOR FEAR AND SAID THAT HE FELT HE OUGHT TO RETURN TO HIS FRIEND AT NIGHT
AND SWORE THAT MOST TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE VISITED ON THE OFFENDER IF HE COULD BE DISCOVERED HE ORDERED THE MERCHANT TO GO BACK AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER HIS WIFE COULD RECOGNISE THE YOUNG MEN
SAW THAT THE PRINCE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SENDING OF THE PILAW AND THEREFORE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LOOK HERE HE SAID IN THIS HANDKERCHIEF IS SOME PILAW THAT THE PRINCESS SENT ME THIS MORNING
SAID THE PRINCE WHO HAD EAGERLY LISTENED TO EVERY WORD WHAT THEN WILL BE HER ANGER AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN ANGER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON
CONSEQUENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND HIS MAGNIFICENT RETINUE HE WAS AT ONCE RECONCILED AND ORDERED HIM TO ENTER THE CITY AND TAKE UP HIS ABODE THERE HENCEFORTH ALL WAS SUNSHINE ON THE PATH OF THE PRINCE
SHE WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO SEE ONE MAN I KNOW THIS IN THIS TREATMENT OF THE OLD WOMAN I SEE HER REQUEST THAT YOU WILL GO AND SEE HER DURING THE COMING DARK FORTNIGHT
YOU DETEST THE SIGHT OF ME I HAVE LOOKED UPON A FAIRY THE PRINCE SAID BUT A MOMENT I SAW HER FACE FOR WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH LOTUS PETALS
OH SHE CRIED I THOUGHT THAT BOTH OF YOU WOULD BE KILLED BY THIS TIME THE ROYAL ELEPHANTS HAVE GOT LOOSE AND ARE RUNNING ABOUT WILDLY WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU
AND SUCH A CITY AS THIS HAS A NAME WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS CITY IVORY CITY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I THOUGHT THE NAME WAS KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD ON THE MENTION OF THE NAME IVORY CITY
OF THESE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS AS HE WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF IN THE FAVOUR OF THE PRINCE
HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE PRINCE EXCLAIMED THE NEXT TIME THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE PALACE
SO THE PRINCESS GAVE ME THIS CHARMED SWING TO RETURN IN BUT COME LET US GET OUTSIDE BEFORE THE ELEPHANTS ARRIVE AND BATTER DOWN THE PLACE DON'T BELIEVE THIS SAID THE VIZIER'S SON IT IS A MERE HOAX
AS SOON AS THE WOMAN RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE TOLD THEM THAT TWO YOUNG MEN HAD PASSED BY THE PLACE WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD MOST DELIBERATELY AIMED AT HER
A PRINCE AND THE SON
SEATED IN A ROOM WITH THE DOOR FASTENED ON THE OUTSIDE THE TWO TRAVELLERS BEMOANED THEIR FATE IT IS NO GOOD GROANING
BECAUSE HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME AND COUNTRY AND RISKED HIS LIFE FOR HIM AND MOREOVER IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS FRIEND'S HELP HE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET WITH HER
WE WILL SPEAK OF THIS LATER ON SAID THE KING ON HEARING THIS ANSWER DISMISS THE PEOPLE THEIR PRESENCE IS NO LONGER NEEDED IN THE EVENING
THE GREEN GRASS UNDER THE COVER OF THE SAUCEPAN TURNED QUITE YELLOW HE WAS ASTONISHED AND SUSPECTING THAT THERE WAS POISON IN THE PILAW HE TOOK A LITTLE AND THREW IT TO SOME CROWS THAT WERE HOPPING ABOUT
YOU CANNOT BRING THEM THE WOMAN SAID TO GO OUT BY ANY OTHER WAY WOULD BE TO THRUST ONESELF INTO THE GRAVE ALL RIGHT THEN
HE LOOKED AROUND AS BEFORE AND THIS TIME DISCOVERED A FAIRY SITTING BY THE BANK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LAKE ON SEEING HER HE FELL SO MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER THAT HE DROPPED DOWN IN A SWOON
THE GIRL PRETENDED TO BE VERY ANGRY WHY HAVE YOU NOT BEEN FOR TWO DAYS SHE ASKED BECAUSE MY DEAR THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED TWO YOUNG TRAVELLERS
STEP INTO IT AND DESIRE TO BE AT HOME THE OLD WOMAN DID SO AND WAS AT ONCE CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR QUICKLY AND SAFELY TO HER HUT WHERE SHE FOUND HER TWO LODGERS SAFE AND SOUND
IN THE NAME OF HER DECEASED UNCLE IT IS SATURATED WITH POISON THANK HEAVEN I DISCOVERED IT IN TIME OH BROTHER WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS THING WHO IS THERE THAT ENTERTAINS ENMITY AGAINST YOU
SENDS YOU AN OFFERING IN THE NAME OF HER DEAD UNCLE ON RECEIVING THE PRESENT
THE KING WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE HEARD OF THE THEFT AND CAUSED PROCLAMATION CONCERNING IT TO BE MADE THROUGHOUT ALL THE CITY AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY IT IS WELL SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHEN HE HEARD OF THIS PROCLAMATION
WHAT YOU ARE DOING ALL KINDS OF TRIAL MAY BE BEFORE ME WHY SHOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME AND COUNTRY TO BE WITH ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
WHOM HE SUPPOSED WAS THE ROBBERS HOUSEKEEPER SHE HAD AGREED TO RELEASE THEM ON THE PROMISE OF HER MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCE
WAS A GREAT PIT WHEREIN THEY THREW THE CORPSES OF THE POOR UNFORTUNATES WHO CHANCED TO FALL INTO THEIR POWER THE TWO MEN CAME FORWARD AND POLITELY ACCOSTING THEM
TILL THEY ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHERE THEY DETERMINED TO SPEND THE NIGHT UNDER ONE OF THE BIG TREES OF THE PLACE THE PRINCE MADE PREPARATIONS FOR A FIRE AND ARRANGED THE FEW ARTICLES OF BEDDING THAT THEY HAD WITH THEM
AND WHILE I GAZED SHE TOOK
I WILL CLIMB TO THE WINDOW AND SEE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY MEANS OF ESCAPE YES YES HE WHISPERED WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW HOLE
WHOSE SERVANT I AM GAVE IT TO ME TO SELL IN THE BAZAAR THE PRINCE REPLIED PERMIT ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHERE HE IS THE PRINCE DIRECTED THE KOTWAL AND THE POLICEMAN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE
GO AWAY COME COME LET US LEAVE THIS PLACE LOOK I HAVE BROUGHT SOME FOOD FOR YOU AND HORSES AND EVERYTHING LET US EAT AND DEPART GO ALONE REPLIED THE PRINCE
MY HUSBAND A THOUSAND THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR BRINGING ME TO YOU SAID THE PRINCE THEN THE PRINCE AND GULIZAR BETROTHED THEMSELVES TO ONE ANOTHER AND PARTED THE ONE FOR THE HUT
TO MANAGE TO COME AND REST AT THEIR HOUSE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY ATTACKED THEM AND STOLE THEIR GOODS THESE THIEVES LIVED IN A KIND OF TOWER WHICH HAD SEVERAL STRONG ROOMS IN IT AND UNDER IT
MY BROTHER WHAT IS THIS OH DO NOT DIE AND LEAVE ME THUS SPEAK SPEAK I CANNOT BEAR THIS IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE REVIVED BY THE WATER
NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT THEM AT THE PALACE HOPING THAT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO SO SHE WOULD MENTION THEIR ARRIVAL AND THUS THE PRINCESS WOULD BE INFORMED OF THEIR COMING ON SEEING HER MOTHER
LISTEN THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO SEE HER I ENTREAT YOU TO TAKE SOME SNOW WITH YOU AND JUST BEFORE SEEING THE PRINCESS PUT A LITTLE OF IT INTO BOTH YOUR EYES IT WILL PROVOKE TEARS
AND RETURNED TO THE HUT EVERY NIGHT ONE MORNING GULIZAR BEGGED HIM TO STAY WITH HER ALWAYS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY AFRAID OF SOME EVIL HAPPENING TO HIM PERHAPS ROBBERS WOULD SLAY HIM
AND WITH HIM THE KOTWAL WHO AT ONCE TOOK THE PRINCE INTO CUSTODY ON THE CHARGE OF STEALING THE PRINCESS'S NECKLACE HOW DID YOU GET THE NECKLACE THE KOTWAL ASKED A FAKIR
AND BEAT HER BACK WITH A SHOVEL WHICH LAY ON THE FIRE AT THE TIME WHILE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME HER NECKLACE GOT LOOSE AND DROPPED YOU WONDER AT THESE WORDS BUT THEY ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO PROVE
HE ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF SOME OF THE VIZIERS ON A CERTAIN DATE COME HE WROTE BACK TO THE VIZIER'S SON AND STAY AT THE PALACE
BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER BROTHER GO AWAY REPLIED THE PRINCE
NIGHT HAD NOT LONG CAST ITS DARK MANTLE OVER THE SCENE WHEN THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE THREW OFF THEIR DISGUISE AND TAKING THEIR HORSES AND LUGGAGE APPEARED BEFORE THE CAGE THEY RELEASED THE PRINCESS
SHE FELT A SMARTING PAIN IN HER BACK AND NOTICED THAT HER PEARL NECKLACE WAS GONE SHE WENT AT ONCE AND INFORMED THE KING OF THE LOSS OF HER NECKLACE BUT SAID NOTHING TO HIM ABOUT THE PAIN IN HER BACK
THROWING HIS ARMS ROUND THE PRINCE'S NECK BECAUSE I CANNOT LET YOU GO ALONE WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER WE WILL BE EXILED TOGETHER AND WE WILL DIE TOGETHER TURN ME NOT BACK IF YOU LOVE ME CONSIDER
TAKING THE HORSES AND BAGS OF MUHRS WENT TO A GRAVEYARD ABOUT A MILE OR SO DISTANT IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE VIZIER'S SON
WENT OUT TWO AND TWO AND WALKED ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT RAN THROUGH THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ROBBING THOSE TRAVELLERS WHO COULD NOT RESIST THEM AND INVITING OTHERS WHO WERE TOO POWERFUL FOR TWO OF THEM
THAT HAD BEEN BURIED A FEW DAYS AGO AND BEGAN TO EAT IT ON SEEING THIS
THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING TRICKS WITH YOU YOU WILL SOON HAVE YOUR HEART'S DESIRE
AND THERE THEY FOUND THE FAKIR WITH HIS EYES SHUT AND ENGAGED IN PRAYER PRESENTLY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS DEVOTIONS THE KOTWAL ASKED HIM
MY EYES FELL ON FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE FOR MY GOOD AT THIS TIME SO WELL DID THEY CHEER MY FAINT HOPES AND TOUCH THE TRUE SOURCE OF MY FEARS
AND TWICE MORE LAND ME ON THE SHORE I THOUGHT THE LAST WAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME
WERE SPENT IN THIS WAY AND I HAD BROUGHT TO LAND ALL THAT ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD LIFT THOUGH IF THE SEA HAD BEEN STILL CALM I MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE WHOLE SHIP PIECE BY PIECE THE LAST TIME
THE LAND IN FRONT OF US RAN OUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES LIKE A BILL AND WE HAD TO KEEP SOME WAY FROM THE COAST TO MAKE THIS POINT SO THAT WE LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORE
AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT THERE WAS ONE NOTCH TOO FEW I NOW TOOK FROM MY STORE
I SWAM TO THE WRECK THE WIND BLEW SO HARD THAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ON BOARD NEXT TIME AT LOW TIDE I FOUND SOME TEA AND SOME GOLD COIN BUT AS TO THE GOLD IT MADE ME LAUGH TO LOOK AT IT
AT ONE TIME I SHOOK WITH COLD AND THEN A HOT FIT CAME ON
THE RAIN FELL FOR SOME DAYS AND A COLD CHILL CAME ON ME IN SHORT I WAS ILL I HAD PAINS IN MY HEAD AND COULD GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
AT LENGTH ONE LARGE WAVE TOOK ME TO THE SHORE AND LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY THOUGH HALF DEAD WITH FEAR
AND PUT THE CASKS IN PILES ROUND THE TENT
SO I MADE MY SMALL CAVE A LARGE ONE AND DUG IT OUT A LONG WAY BACK IN THE SAND ROCK THEN I BROUGHT THE MOUTH OF IT UP TO THE FENCE AND SO MADE A BACK WAY TO MY HOUSE
I MADE SIGNS THAT THEY SHOULD BRING ME SOME FOOD AND THEY ON THEIR PART MADE SIGNS FOR ME TO STOP MY BOAT SO I LET DOWN THE TOP OF MY SAIL AND LAY BY
ASK WHY THOU WERT NOT TORN BY THE BEASTS OF PREY ON THE COASTS
AS LOOK OUT FOR A SAIL MY GOODS FROM THE WRECK HAD BEEN IN THE CAVE FOR MORE THAN TEN MONTHS AND IT WAS TIME NOW TO PUT THEM RIGHT AS THEY TOOK UP ALL THE SPACE AND LEFT ME NO ROOM TO TURN IN
FOR NOW A NEW STRENGTH HAD COME TO ME AND THERE WAS A CHANGE IN MY GRIEFS AS WELL AS IN MY JOYS
AND THERE WAS A NOISE AND A ROAR ALL AROUND ME
ROUND MY HOUSE TO THE HEIGHT OF A FOOT AND A HALF I HAD TO GO OUT ONCE A DAY IN SEARCH OF FOOD
WHILE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIP'S CREW WERE LOST
YET AS THERE WAS NO USE IN THAT IT STRUCK ME THAT THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO WAS TO SWIM TO THE SHIP I SOON THREW OFF MY CLOTHES TOOK TO THE SEA AND SWAM UP TO THE WRECK
WELL I TOLD THESE MEN THAT I WOULD GO WITH ALL MY HEART IF THEY WOULD LOOK TO MY FARM IN THE MEAN TIME WHICH THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO SO
HERE I HAD WELL NIGH LOST MY FREIGHT FOR THE SHORE LAY ON A SLOPE SO THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO LAND ON SAVE WHERE ONE END OF THE RAFT WOULD LIE SO HIGH AND ONE END SO LOW
AND A GUST OF WIND WOULD MAKE ALL MY STORE SLIDE OFF
AND THESE I PUT ON THE RAFT WHEN THE HIGH TIDE CAME UP IT TOOK OFF MY COAT AND SHIRT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE BUT THERE WERE SOME FRESH CLOTHES IN THE SHIP
SO THAT I COULD GET NEAR THE SHIP AND HERE I FOUND
LORD LOOK ON ME WOULD I CRY FOR HOURS AT LAST THE FIT LEFT ME AND I SLEPT
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE HAND THAT MADE IT MADE THE AIR THE EARTH THE SKY AND WHO IS THAT IT IS GOD
AS I HAD FOUND A USE FOR THE BAG WHICH HAD HELD THE FOWL'S FOOD ON BOARD SHIP I SHOOK OUT FROM IT THE HUSKS OF CORN THIS WAS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE GREAT RAINS FELL
NOW LIFT UP MY HANDS NOW FOLD THEM ON MY BREAST AND THANK GOD FOR ALL THAT HE HAD DONE FOR ME WHEN THE REST OF THE MEN WERE LOST
WHY SHOULD NOT I GO AND YOU STAY IN THE BOAT AT THIS XURY SAID IF WILD MANS COME THEY EAT ME YOU GO WAY
I CAME ON THESE SHORES ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF JUNE IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE ON THE SIDE OF THIS POST I MADE A NOTCH EACH DAY AS IT CAME AND THIS I KEPT UP TILL THE LAST
WHILE FROM MY HOUSE NO SHIPS COULD COME ON MY SIDE OF THE ISLE AND NOT BE SEEN BY ME YET THE COOL SOFT BANKS WERE SO SWEET AND NEW TO ME THAT MUCH OF MY TIME WAS SPENT THERE
ONE DAY SOME MEN CAME TO ASK ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF A SLAVE SHIP TO BE SENT OUT BY THEM THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE ME A SHARE IN THE SLAVES AND PAY THE COST OF THE STOCK
AND LAY BUT A MILE FROM ME WHILE THE BOAT WAS ON THE BEACH TWO MILES ON MY RIGHT I WENT SOME WAY DOWN BY THE SHORE TO GET TO THE BOAT
FOR I HAVE BUT DONE FOR YOU WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE FOR ME HAD I BEEN IN THE SAME PLIGHT
AND HAD SEEN NO WILD MEN I MADE A GUESS
WHOLE FLOCKS OF BIRDS FLEW UP WITH LOUD CRIES FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WOOD
OR TO FIND FAULT WITH ME WHAT A TREAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOW THAT I HAD BROUGHT INK FROM THE SHIP I WROTE DOWN A SKETCH OF EACH DAY AS IT CAME NOT SO MUCH TO LEAVE TO THOSE WHO MIGHT READ IT
I HAD NOW TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME SPOT WHERE I COULD MAKE MY HOME HALF WAY UP A HILL THERE WAS A SMALL PLAIN FOUR OR FIVE SCORE FEET LONG AND TWICE AS BROAD AND
SPREAD ONE OF THE BEDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM THE SHIP ON THE GROUND LAID TWO GUNS CLOSE TO MY HEAD AND WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME I SLEPT ALL NIGHT FOR I WAS MUCH IN NEED OF REST
AND I WAS SAFE I NOW CAST MY EYES ROUND ME
THAT I MUST MEET WITH SOME SHIP OR DIE
AND THEN JUST SWAM TO THE LAND WHERE HE FELL DOWN DEAD THE MEN WERE IN AS MUCH FEAR AT THE SOUND OF MY GUN AS THEY HAD BEEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE BEASTS BUT WHEN I MADE SIGNS FOR THEM TO COME TO THE SHORE
TWO ROWS OF STAKES TILL THEY STOOD FIRM LIKE PILES FIVE AND A HALF FEET FROM THE GROUND I MADE THE STAKES CLOSE AND TIGHT WITH BITS OF ROPE
AND WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO LEAVE ME IN A KIND OF SWOON WHICH THANK GOD DID NOT LAST LONG
I HAD SOWN IT TOO LATE IN THE NEXT IT WAS SPOILT BY THE DROUGHT
LIKE A BIRD IN A STORM THEN ALL THE GLEE I FELT AT FIRST LEFT ME
WHICH GAVE SO GREAT A CHARM TO THE SPOT AS TO MAKE ME WISH TO LIVE THERE BUT
NOW I SHALL NOT STARVE FOR I FOUND FOUR LARGE GUNS BUT HOW WAS MY RAFT TO BE GOT TO LAND I HAD NO SAIL NO OARS
THERE HAD BEEN A BOAT AT HER STERN BUT WE FOUND IT HAD BEEN TORN OFF BY THE FORCE OF THE WAVES ONE SMALL BOAT WAS STILL LEFT ON THE SHIP'S SIDE SO
I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE AND THEY HAVE DWELT IN MY HEART TO THIS DAY I LAID DOWN THE BOOK TO PRAY MY CRY WAS O LORD
TO LET ME GET NEAR THEM AT LAST I LAY IN WAIT FOR THEM CLOSE TO THEIR OWN HAUNTS
IT MUST BE HE WHO GUIDES THEM AND IF SO
HE CAME UP AND SAID AS I SEE
WHO STOOD TO LOOK AT US THEY WERE BLACK AND WORE NO CLOTHES
AND LAID SHORT BITS OF PLANK ON THEM CROSS WAYS TO MAKE MY RAFT STRONG THOUGH THESE PLANKS WOULD BEAR MY OWN WEIGHT THEY WERE TOO SLIGHT TO BEAR MUCH OF MY FREIGHT SO
I SAW THAT THERE WERE BIRDS ON THE ISLE AND I SHOT ONE OF THEM MINE MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GUN THAT HAD BEEN HEARD THERE SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR AT THE SOUND OF IT
AND I SOON GAVE UP ALL DULL THOUGHTS
SPRINGS AND CREEKS SO I SET OFF AND BROUGHT BACK WITH ME LIMES AND GRAPES IN THEIR PRIME LARGE AND RIPE
AND STUCK MY TWO OARS IN THE SAND ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE RAFT THUS I LET HER LIE TILL THE EBB OF THE TIDE AND WHEN IT WENT DOWN SHE WAS LEFT SAFE ON LAND WITH ALL HER FREIGHT
AND THE SHIP STRUCK ON A BANK OF SAND IN WHICH SHE SANK SO DEEP THAT WE COULD NOT GET HER OFF
FOR I SAW THE TOP OF THE GREAT PEAK WHICH I KNEW WAS NEAR THEM MY ONE HOPE WAS THAT IF I KEPT NEAR THE COAST I SHOULD FIND SOME SHIP THAT WOULD TAKE US ON BOARD AND THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
HIS WHINE HIS GROWL AND HIS TRICKS HE WOULD ALL BUT TALK TO ME
NOW THAT I HAD TWO FREIGHTS OF GOODS AT HAND I MADE A TENT WITH THE SHIP'S SAILS TO STOW THEM IN AND CUT THE POLES FOR IT FROM THE WOOD
DOST THOU ASK WHY GOD HATH DONE THIS TO THEE ASK WHY THOU WERT NOT SHOT BY THE MOORS WHO CAME ON BOARD THE SHIP AND TOOK THE LIVES OF THY MATES
O DRUG SAID I THOU ART OF NO USE TO ME
THE SKIN OF WHICH MADE ME A CAP
A THING NOW TOOK PLACE ON THE ISLE WHICH NO ONE COULD HAVE DREAMT OF AND WHICH STRUCK ME DOWN WITH FEAR IT WAS THIS THE GROUND SHOOK WITH GREAT FORCE
AND THIS TOOK UP THE REST OF THE DAY WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT
THAT I MIGHT LAY UP A STORE THE VALE ON THE BANKS OF WHICH THEY GREW WAS FRESH AND GREEN
AND WHEN IT HAD GONE OFF I SAT QUITE STILL ON THE GROUND FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
I HAD PUT A SMALL SUM IN THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND THIS MY FRIEND SAID I SHOULD DO WELL TO SPEND ON MY FARM SO WHEN HE GOT HOME HE SENT SOME OF IT IN CASH
AND IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH BLADES OF RICE CORN AND RYE SPRANG UP AS TIME WENT BY AND THE GRAIN WAS RIPE I KEPT IT AND TOOK CARE TO SOW IT EACH YEAR
THEN DO THEY MOUNT TO THE SKY AND FROM THENCE GO DOWN TO THE DEEP MY SOUL FAINTS I REEL TO AND FRO AND AM AT MY WIT'S END
AND WITH THIS SUM HE WAS SO KIND AS TO BUY ME A SLAVE IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD BOUGHT A SLAVE SO NOW I HAD TWO
GOD WHO SHAPES OUR WAYS AND LED ME BY THE HAND THEN CAN SAVE ME FROM THIS STATE NOW
THAT ALL MY GOODS WOULD FALL OFF TO WAIT TILL THE TIDE CAME UP WAS ALL THAT COULD BE DONE SO WHEN THE SEA WAS A FOOT DEEP I THRUST THE RAFT
WE SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN SAFE
THERE WAS TOO SOME RUM OF WHICH I TOOK A GOOD DRAUGHT AND THIS GAVE ME HEART WHAT I STOOD MOST IN NEED OF WAS A BOAT TO TAKE THE GOODS TO SHORE
TILL THE SHIP GO DOWN THEN GO THOU WITH IT
TREES WERE TORN UP BY THE ROOTS
YOU MAY BE SURE THAT MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO LOOK ROUND FOR SOME FOOD AND I SOON MADE MY WAY TO THE BIN WHERE THE BREAD WAS KEPT AND ATE SOME OF IT AS I WENT TO AND FRO FOR THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE
HAD I BEEN IN IT WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE I SHOULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE I HAD NOW TO SET UP POSTS IN MY CAVE WITH PLANKS ON THE TOP OF THEM SO AS TO MAKE A ROOF OF WOOD
AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEY CAME BACK WITH SOME DRY MEAT AND A SORT OF CORN WHICH IS GROWN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
ONCE MORE THERE WAS A SHOCK AND NOW THE EARTH FELL FROM THE ROOF OF MY CAVE
AND SUCH LIKE GOODS MY AUNT HAD PUT A FEW POUNDS IN MY FRIEND'S HANDS AS A GIFT TO HIM
IN THE HOPE THAT IF THOSE ON DECK COULD NOT HEAR THE SOUND THEY MIGHT SEE THE SMOKE THIS THEY DID SEE AND THEN LET DOWN THEIR SAILS SO THAT WE MIGHT COME UP TO THEM
AND ART SAFE A SOUND SLEEP THEN FELL ON ME AND WHEN I WOKE IT MUST HAVE BEEN THREE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN NAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT
SO I HAD TO SWIM BACK WITH ALL SPEED FOR I KNEW THAT AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE I SHOULD FIND IT HARD WORK TO GET TO LAND AT ALL BUT IN SPITE OF THE HIGH WIND I CAME TO MY HOME ALL SAFE
WE NOW GAVE UP OUR WHOLE SOULS TO GOD THE SEA GREW MORE AND MORE ROUGH AND ITS WHITE FOAM WOULD CURL AND BOIL
WHICH SAT ON ONE OF THE CHESTS WHEN I CAME UP I HELD MY GUN AT HER BUT AS SHE DID NOT KNOW
AND THEN I SET OFF WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO THE SHORE
BURST ON THE BOAT'S SIDE
I KNEW THAT TOOLS WOULD BE MY FIRST WANT AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO GRIND MINE ON THE STONE
AND A ROLL OF LEAD BUT THIS LAST I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO HOIST UP TO THE SHIP'S SIDE SO AS TO GET IT ON MY RAFT THERE WERE SOME SPARE SAILS TOO WHICH I BROUGHT TO SHORE
WE KNEW NOT WHERE ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRY OF
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR ME IF I HAD NOT HAD FARMS AND LAND
AND THEN MY HEAD SHOT OUT AT THE TOP OF THE WAVES THIS GAVE ME HEART AND BREATH TOO AND SOON MY FEET FELT THE GROUND I STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A SHORT TIME TO LET THE SEA RUN BACK FROM ME
AND I BROUGHT BACK AS MUCH AS THE RAFT WOULD HOLD ONE DAY I HAD PUT TOO GREAT A LOAD ON THE RAFT WHICH MADE IT SINK DOWN ON ONE SIDE SO THAT THE GOODS WERE LOST IN THE SEA
AND HE NOT KNOW IT THEN GOD MUST KNOW HOW SICK AND SAD I AM AND HE WILLS ME TO BE HERE O WHY HATH GOD DONE THIS TO ME THEN SOME VOICE WOULD SEEM TO SAY
WELL SAID I
TRUE I AM CAST ON A ROUGH AND RUDE PART OF THE GLOBE BUT THERE ARE NO BEASTS OF PREY ON IT TO KILL OR HURT ME
I HAD BUT A KNIFE AND A PIPE IT NOW GREW DARK
BUT THE RATS HAD GOT AT IT AND IT WAS ALL GONE MY NEXT TASK WAS TO SCREEN MY GOODS FROM THE SPRAY OF THE SEA
HE SAID IT WAS JUST AND RIGHT IN ME TO FEEL THUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF I COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO PART WITH HIM HE SHOULD BE SET FREE IN TWO YEARS TIME SO
THIS DONE I PUT SHELVES ON EACH SIDE TO HOLD MY GOODS WHICH MADE MY CAVE LOOK LIKE A SHOP FULL OF STORES TO MAKE THESE SHELVES I CUT DOWN A TREE AND WITH THE HELP OF A SAW AN AXE A PLANE
TO MY GREAT JOY I GOT UP TO THE CLIFFS CLOSE TO THE SHORE WHERE I FOUND SOME GRASS OUT OF THE REACH OF THE SEA THERE I SAT DOWN SAFE ON LAND AT LAST
A CALM SEA A TIDE WHICH SET IN TO THE SHORE AND A SLIGHT BREEZE TO BLOW ME THERE I HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO FIND SOME OARS IN A PART OF THE SHIP IN WHICH I HAD MADE NO SEARCH TILL NOW
AND PUT SMALL STICKS ON THE TOP OF THEM IN THE SHAPE OF SPIKES THIS MADE SO STRONG A FENCE THAT NO MAN OR BEAST COULD GET IN THE DOOR OF MY HOUSE WAS ON THE TOP AND I HAD TO CLIMB UP TO IT BY STEPS
AND WAS NOW A FREE MAN I HAD MADE A GOOD SUM BY ALL MY STORE
NOR DID THEY DARE TO COME TO US AT LAST THEY TOOK A SAFE WAY FOR US ALL FOR THEY BROUGHT THE FOOD TO THE SHORE WHERE THEY SET IT DOWN
THE HEART OF EACH NOW GREW FAINT OUR CHEEKS WERE PALE AND OUR EYES WERE DIM FOR THERE WAS BUT ONE HOPE AND THAT WAS TO FIND SOME BAY AND SO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LAND
THE KID STOOD NEAR HER TILL I TOOK HER OFF ON MY BACK AND THEN THE YOUNG ONE RAN BY MY SIDE
THOUGH NOT MORE THAN THAT
SHE HAD SIX GUNS TWELVE MEN AND A BOY WE TOOK WITH US SAWS CHAINS TOYS BEADS BITS OF GLASS
THEN I CUT A STICK TO KEEP OFF THE BEASTS OF PREY IN CASE THEY SHOULD COME AND FELL TO SLEEP JUST AS IF THE BRANCH I LAY ON HAD BEEN A BED OF DOWN WHEN I WOKE UP IT WAS BROAD DAY
WHICH I TOOK IN WITH ME SO THAT NO ONE ELSE MIGHT COME UP BY THE SAME WAY CLOSE TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE STOOD A HIGH ROCK IN WHICH I MADE A CAVE
I DREAMT THAT I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SAW A MAN COME DOWN FROM A GREAT BLACK CLOUD IN A FLAME OF LIGHT WHEN HE STOOD ON THE EARTH IT SHOOK AS IT HAD DONE A FEW DAYS SINCE
WHO KNEW BEST SAID NOT YOU GO NOT YOU GO SO I BROUGHT THE BOAT AS NEAR THE LAND AS I COULD THAT I MIGHT TALK TO THEM AND THEY KEPT UP WITH ME A LONG WAY
AT DAWN OF DAY I PUT MY HEAD OUT AND CAST MY EYES ON THE SEA WHEN LO NO SHIP WAS THERE
AND CAME BACK WITH A HARE THAT HE HAD SHOT WHICH WE WERE GLAD TO COOK AND EAT
THE NEXT DAY I WAS SAD AND SICK AT HEART
BUT I TOLD HIM THAT AS IT WAS BY THE BOY'S HELP THAT I HAD GOT FREE
I TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALL I HAD BUT HE SAID
SHOULD I FEEL A FREE MAN
BUT I HAD MADE IT FAR TOO LARGE FOR IN COURSE OF TIME THE EARTH FELL IN FROM THE ROOF
I DID MY BEST TO FLOAT ON THE TOP AND HELD MY BREATH TO DO SO THE NEXT WAVE WAS QUITE AS HIGH AND SHUT ME UP IN ITS BULK I HELD MY HANDS DOWN TIGHT TO MY SIDE
ROUND ME AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE KIND FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HERE IN HIS SHIP NOW MEANT TO LEAVE THESE SHORES ON MY FIRST START TO SEA WHEN A BOY
AND TO WORK ONCE MORE TILL THE SUN HAD SET AND THEN TO BED
AS IT HAD A FULL VIEW OF THE SEA I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR MY HOUSE I FIRST DUG A TRENCH ROUND A SPACE WHICH TOOK IN TWELVE YARDS AND IN THIS I DROVE
AND MADE A KIND OF HUT FOR THE NIGHT AS THERE WAS STILL A GREAT STORE OF THINGS LEFT IN THE SHIP WHICH WOULD BE OF USE TO ME
HELP ME TO LOVE AND LEARN THY WAYS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ALL MY LIFE THAT I HAD FELT A SENSE THAT GOD WAS NEAR AND HEARD ME
SO I MADE A WHEEL BY WHICH I COULD MOVE IT WITH MY FOOT THIS WAS NO SMALL TASK BUT I TOOK GREAT PAINS WITH IT AND AT LENGTH IT WAS DONE
I THOUGHT THE TOP OF SOME HIGH TREE WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO KEEP ME OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THAT THERE I MIGHT SIT AND THINK OF DEATH FOR AS YET I HAD NO HOPES OF LIFE
FOR I KNEW THAT THE FIRST STORM WOULD BREAK UP THE SHIP
SO I PUT IT IN A PIECE OF THE SAIL
BUT JUST THEN THE CURVE OF A HUGE WAVE ROSE UP AS HIGH AS A HILL AND THIS I HAD NO STRENGTH TO KEEP FROM SO IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE SEA
WHICH WAS ON BOARD AND CUT A MAST IN THREE LENGTHS AND THESE GAVE GREAT STRENGTH TO THE RAFT I FOUND SOME BREAD AND RICE A DUTCH CHEESE AND SOME DRY GOAT'S FLESH THERE HAD BEEN SOME WHEAT
BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH TO BE DONE FOR ME TO DWELL LONG ON MY SAD LOT
BUT AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT WE WERE AT HAND TO TAKE A GREAT PRIZE FOR THEM FOR TWO WILD BEASTS OF THE SAME KIND AS THE FIRST I SPOKE OF CAME IN FULL CHASE FROM THE HILLS DOWN TO THE SEA
AND AS THERE WERE SOME SPARE YARDS IN THE SHIP TWO OR THREE LARGE PLANKS OF WOOD AND A SPARE MAST OR TWO I FELL TO WORK WITH THESE TO MAKE A RAFT I PUT FOUR SPARS SIDE BY SIDE
WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD THE LAD CRY OUT A SHIP WITH A SAIL A SHIP WITH A SAIL
THEY SHALL NOT EAT YOU OR ME
SEE HERE IS A PRIZE SAID I OUT LOUD
AND TOOK GOOD CARE THIS TIME NOT TO LOAD MY RAFT TOO MUCH THE FIRST THING I SOUGHT FOR WAS THE TOOL CHEST AND IN IT WERE SOME BAGS OF NAILS SPIKES SAWS
WHICH WOULD LAST SIX HOURS AT A TIME ILL AS I WAS I HAD TO GO OUT WITH MY GUN TO GET FOOD I SHOT A GOAT BUT IT WAS A GREAT TOIL TO BRING IT HOME AND STILL MORE TO COOK IT
I HAD TO GO TO BED AT DUSK TILL I MADE A LAMP OF GOAT'S FAT WHICH I PUT IN A CLAY DISH AND THIS
AT LENGTH I MET WITH A MAN WHOSE CASE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS MY OWN AND WE BOTH TOOK SOME LAND TO FARM MY STOCK LIKE HIS WAS LOW BUT WE MADE OUR FARMS SERVE TO KEEP US IN FOOD
NO ONE TO MAKE ME THINK IT WAS DULL TO ROAM DAY BY DAY FROM THE WOOD TO THE SHORE
WHEN I WAS DEAD AND GONE AS TO GET RID OF MY OWN THOUGHTS AND DRAW ME FROM THE FEARS WHICH ALL DAY LONG DWELT ON MY MIND
YOU MAY GUESS HOW FOND I WAS OF THEM FOR THEY WERE ALL THE FRIENDS LEFT TO ME I BROUGHT THE DOG AND TWO CATS FROM THE SHIP THE DOG WOULD FETCH THINGS FOR ME AT ALL TIMES AND BY HIS BARK
BUT HOW WAS I TO GET ON DECK I HAD SWAM TWICE ROUND THE SHIP WHEN A PIECE OF ROPE CAUGHT MY EYE
NOW THOU SHALT DIE THEN I WOKE AND FOUND IT WAS A DREAM WEAK AND FAINT I WAS IN DREAD ALL DAY LEST MY FIT SHOULD COME ON
BUT IF THEY WERE IN THE VALE AND I ON HIGH GROUND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME THE FIRST GOAT I SHOT HAD A KID BY HER SIDE AND WHEN THE OLD ONE FELL
BUT RAIN FELL ALL THAT NIGHT AND A GREAT PART OF THE NEXT DAY NOW THOUGH QUITE WORN OUT I HAD TO MOVE MY GOODS WHICH WERE IN THE CAVE TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AT LAST A SCOT ON BOARD SAID IN MY OWN TONGUE WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS HOW I HAD GOT FREE FROM THE MOORS THEN THE MAN WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE SHIP BADE ME COME ON BOARD
THAT AT FIRST THE WAVES HID IT BY THE HELP OF THIS ROPE I GOT ON BOARD I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A BULGE IN THE SHIP AND THAT SHE HAD SPRUNG A LEAK
ONE OF THESE BEASTS CAME NEAR OUR BOAT SO I LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM WITH MY GUN AND AS SOON AS THE BRUTE WAS IN RANGE I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD TWICE HE SANK DOWN IN THE SEA AND TWICE HE CAME UP
FOR THE SHOCKS WERE JUST AS STRONG THERE AS ON LAND
THEY TOOK HEART AND CAME THEY AT ONCE MADE FOR THEIR PRIZE AND BY THE HELP OF A ROPE WHICH THEY SLUNG ROUND HIM THEY BROUGHT HIM SAFE ON THE BEACH
THE SKY TOO WAS CLEAR AND THE SEA CALM
AND SOME MORE TOOLS I MADE BOARDS A CHAIR AND A DESK TO WRITE ON CAME NEXT I ROSE IN GOOD TIME AND SET TO WORK TILL NOON THEN I ATE MY MEAL
BUT SOON I FOUND IT DROVE TO ONE SIDE AT LENGTH I SAW A CREEK TO WHICH WITH SOME TOIL I TOOK MY RAFT AND NOW THE BEACH WAS SO NEAR THAT I FELT MY OAR TOUCH THE GROUND
SO MUCH FOR THE SAD VIEW OF MY CASE BUT LIKE MOST THINGS IT HAD A BRIGHT SIDE AS WELL AS A DARK ONE FOR HERE WAS I SAFE ON LAND
AND A GREAT PART OF THE ISLE WAS LAID WASTE WITH THE STORM I THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD HAD COME TO AN END IN THREE HOURS TIME ALL WAS CALM
THEN THE LORD BRINGS ME OUT OF ALL MY FEARS
FOR FEAR OF BEASTS OF PREY AS WELL AS SNAKES BUT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THESE FEARS AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND I PUT THE CHESTS AND BOARDS ROUND ME AS WELL AS I COULD
TOO ILL TO GET OUT WITH MY GUN I SAT ON THE SHORE TO THINK
I COULD BUT CRY OUT IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALM THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS THESE MEN SEE THE WORKS OF THE LORD IN THE DEEP FOR AT HIS WORD THE STORMS RISE
THE MEN SPOKE TO US IN FRENCH
FOR I HAD MADE A LARGE SUM
BUT I KNEW WELL FROM THE LOOK OF HER THAT SHE WAS NOT ONE OF THE TURK'S I MADE ALL THE SAIL I COULD TO COME IN THE SHIP'S WAY
I SPENT THE NEXT DAY IN BED AND FELT HALF DEAD FROM THIRST YET TOO WEAK TO STAND UP TO GET SOME DRINK I LAY AND WEPT LIKE A CHILD LORD LOOK ON ME
THEN YOU'VE LEFT THEM AT HOME HE INSISTED MISSUS LADYBUG SMILED A VERY KNOWING SORT OF SMILE WHEN HE SAW IT BUSTER BUMBLEBEE COULDN'T HELP FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE SOMEHOW HE KNEW THAT HE HAD BLUNDERED
ON THE OUTSIDE TOWARDS THE BOIS THERE IS A WELL KEPT MARKET GARDEN THE ONLY NOISES ON THIS SUNNY AFTERNOON ARE THE TWITTERING OF BIRDS AND THE RUSTLING OF LEAVES
YET WHILE I TRUDGED ON
LEFT IN HIS HAND JOHNNIE GAVE IT A FLING SLIPPED AN ARM THROUGH THE HANDLE OF HIS LUNCH BASKET AND SET TO PULLING MIGHTILY ON THE BRIDLE REINS THERE SAID TWINKLEHEELS THERE GOES THAT WHIP
WHERE WAS ROSE I DASHED BACK INTO THE SALON AND THERE UPON A TABLE I FOUND A LETTER ADDRESSED TO ME IN HER FAMILIAR HAND TEARING IT OPEN
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE ANOTHER ROAR
THAN THAT I SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO DRAG OUT AN EXISTENCE TILL TO DAY BUT THE BOMBARDMENT HAD RECOMMENCED VIGOROUSLY AND AS I WAS BEING LED ALONG A SHELL FELL CLOSE TO MY ESCORT
I READ EAGERLY THE THREE BRIEF LINES IT CONTAINED THEN STAGGERED BACK AS IF I HAD RECEIVED A BLOW A SECOND LATER I FELT CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF SOME ONE AT MY ELBOW
AND HE ROSE TO A PLACE AMONG THE FIRST LAWYERS OF HIS STATE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN HE WAS ADMITTED AS COUNSELOR OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE
SOMETHING PROMPTED ME TO REFRAIN FROM CHALLENGING AND WITH RIFLE READY I QUICKLY HURRIED TO THE SPOT WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE A MAN IN A WORKMAN'S BLOUSE SPRANG FORWARD RIGHT UP TO THE MUZZLE OF MY GUN
THAT BY THE INTERCESSION OF SEVERAL OF ITS LEADING MEMBERS HE WAS ADMITTED AS AN ATTORNEY BY THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ERIE COUNTY
HE FOUND HER HARD AT WORK DESTROYING INSECTS ON AN OLD APPLE TREE AND WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM MISSUS LADYBUG PAUSED IN HER LABORS
HIS FATHER SAID NOTHING MORE BUT HE SMILED A LITTLE TO HIMSELF WHEN JOHNNIE WASN'T LOOKING HIS WAY BOYS WILL BE BOYS FARMER GREEN REMARKED AFTER JOHNNIE HAD GONE
GO GET YOURSELF SOME WORKING CLOTHES TAKE OFF YOUR BLACK VELVET AND GOLD AND SAVE THAT SUIT FOR BEST YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BUSTER TRIED TO EXPLAIN BEING A QUEEN'S SON
SEVERE DRUDGERY TEACHING AND ASSISTING THE POST MASTER BY THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE HE HAD SO FAR GAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE BAR
AN OUTLAW THAT HERE IN PARIS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
JUST THEN JOHNNIE CAUGHT UP THE POLE OATS AND CORN TWINKLEHEELS EXCLAIMED WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO WITH THAT ENORMOUS WHIP HE WAS SO STARTLED THAT HE JUMPED SIDEWAYS
BUT ON THE OUTBREAK OF WAR MY CHANCES OF FORTUNE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY WRECKED AND I HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO SERVE WITH THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTH REGIMENT OF INFANTRY FIRST UNDER GENERAL CHANZY ON THE LOIRE
THEN BUSTER BUMBLEBEE RECEIVED THE SURPRISE OF HIS LIFE
BEARING THE WORDS ROSE HENAULT EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO MY ENEMY PAUL OLBRICH A YEAR AFTER THE WAR HAD ENDED
AT THIS POINT BUSTER MANAGED TO INTERRUPT HER DON'T TALK ABOUT WINGS PLEASE HE CRIED WHO ARE YOU TO TALK ABOUT WINGS WHEN YOU HAVEN'T ANY YOURSELF
HAD TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT HER FIRST LOVE AND NOW I REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD LONG AGO BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH MY FELLOW STUDENT PAUL OLBRICH IT WAS MY OWN WIFE WHOM I HAD ASSISTED TO ELOPE WITH MY ENEMY
WE HAD HELD THOSE WALLS
ANOTHER ACT OF INCENDIARISM AND NOW AND THEN THE BOOMING OF ARTILLERY ECHOED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IN OUR QUARTER
WILL NOT BETRAY ME WHEN LAST I HEARD OF YOU TWO YEARS AGO I SAID YOU WERE A LIEUTENANT OF DRAGOONS TO NIGHT YOU ARE HERE INSIDE PARIS DISGUISED
AND TURNING FOUND MARIETTE OUR MAID OF ALL WORK MY WIFE WHERE IS MY WIFE I GASPED

THE PENALTY WAS DEATH THE STERN GREY HAIRED GENERAL BEFORE WHOM I WAS TAKEN HALF AN HOUR LATER PRONOUNCED SENTENCE AND WITHOUT CEREMONY I WAS HURRIED OFF TO EXECUTION
AND REPLYING WITH MONOTONOUS UNCEASING REGULARITY HUNDREDS OF OUR GALLANT COMRADES WERE ALAS LYING DEAD HUNDREDS WERE IN THE TEMPORARY HOSPITALS
CAYUGA COUNTY WAS THEN A WILDERNESS WITH FEW SETTLERS CONSEQUENTLY YOUNG FILLMORE'S EDUCATION WAS LIMITED TO INSTRUCTION IN READING WRITING SPELLING AND THE SIMPLEST BRANCHES OF ARITHMETIC
WITH THE HORRORS OF WAR AROUND ME MY LIFE HAS BECOME SOURED AND MY HAIR GREY SINCE THAT EVENTFUL NIGHT
MISSUS LADYBUG STARTED AND SHE GAVE HIM A QUEER LOOK WHAT'S THAT SHE INQUIRED WHAT'S THAT SAY THAT AGAIN
AND COMMENCED PRACTICE AT AURORA WHERE HIS FATHER RESIDED
HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE WATCH SHARP YOUNG SIR MISSUS LADYBUG BADE HIM
AS AN ADVOCATE I HAD BEEN DISTINCTLY SUCCESSFUL HAVING BEEN ENTRUSTED
THE PLACE LOOKED UNUTTERABLY CHEERLESS AND THE THUNDER OF THE GUNS WAS CAUSING THE WINDOWS TO RATTLE PASSING QUICKLY INTO THE BEDROOM I FOUND THE CEILING OPEN TO THE SKY AND A HUGE GAP IN THE WALL
THERE IS A STEEP LITTLE PATH RUNNING UP THE GRASS GROWN MOUND BESIDE A RAILING ASCEND IT AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ON THE TOP OF THE GREAT WALL
AND THAT I HAD ALLOWED HIM TO PASS OUT OF THE CITY THUS ALL WAS DISCOVERED AND I WAS AT ONCE ARRESTED AS A TRAITOR AS ONE WHO HAD RENDERED ASSISTANCE TO A PRUSSIAN SPY
AND WHICH PASSED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE IN CONGRESS HE SUPPORTED JOHN QUINCY ADAMS IN HIS ASSERTION OF THE RIGHT OF PETITION ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
HER SHELL LIKE BLACK DOTTED RED BACK AND SPREAD A PAIR OF DELICATE BROWN WINGS SEE THESE SHE SAID TO BUSTER BUMBLEBEE WHO GASPED AT HER BLANKLY I'VE REALLY TWO PAIRS
ESTABLISHED IN THE NEIGHBOURING CHURCHES BUT WE THE SURVIVORS
THAT IT WAS NOT AN EASY MATTER TO SAY ANYTHING TO MISSUS LADYBUG MISSUS LADYBUG ALWAYS LIKED TO DO MOST OF THE TALKING HERSELF SHE PREFERRED TO LET OTHERS LISTEN
WHAT'S THE MATTER HIS FATHER ASKED HIM YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP GOING FISHING HAVE YOU NO JOHNNIE ANSWERED I'M GOING TO HARNESS TWINKLEHEELS TO THE BUGGY AND I'LL CUT A POLE AT THE CREEK
I'M THE QUEEN'S SON I DON'T HAVE TO WORK HE DECLARED SOMEWHAT HOTLY RUBBISH CRIED MISSUS LADYBUG REGARDING HIM WITH A FROWN
ON FOOT NOW ENTERED THE NATIONAL CAPITOL AS THE RULER OF A MIGHTY NATION DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION A TREATY WITH JAPAN SECURING FOR THE UNITED STATES VALUABLE COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGES WAS CONSUMMATED
BREATHLESSLY I MOUNTED THE LONG FLIGHTS OF STAIRS THAT LED TO MY HOME AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH MY KEY ENTERING OUR LITTLE SALON I LOOKED AROUND IN THE COLD GREY LIGHT OF DAWN
PARIS FETTERED EXISTING UPON BLACK BREAD AND HORSE FLESH SHIVERED UNDER AN ICY MANTLE THE BLACK BRANCHES OF THE LEAFLESS TREES OVER IN THE BOIS
DROP THAT JUNK THAT YOU'RE CARRYING FARMER GREEN SHOUTED WHY DOESN'T HE TELL JOHNNIE TO DROP THAT LONG WHIP TWINKLEHEELS MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WHAT FARMER GREEN SAID
INFIRM FORSAKEN AND FORGOTTEN WHAT MATTERS THOUGH I STILL WEAR MY FADED SCRAP OF YELLOW AND GREEN RIBBON UPON THE LAPEL OF MY SHABBY COAT
YES THE HIRED MAN AGREED AND PONIES WILL BE PONIES THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TALKING IN RIDDLES
AT FOURTEEN HE WAS BOUND OUT TO LEARN THE FULLER'S TRADE THINK OF IT BOYS WHAT SPLENDID OPPORTUNITIES MOST OF YOU HAVE YES ALL OF YOU HAVE COMPARED TO THAT OF FILLMORE
UNDER THE STRONGEST PORTION OF THE WALL AT THE POINT I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF COURBEVOIE THERE WAS A LURID GLARE IN THE SKY SHOWING THAT THE ENEMY HAD COMMITTED
AND BURSTING KILLED TWO OF THE POOR FELLOWS AND DEMORALISED THE REST I SAW MY CHANCE AND DARTED AWAY
AND TURNING SHARPLY TRAMPED ONWARD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHILE MY OLD FRIEND AND THE WOMAN HE HAD RESCUED FROM STARVATION WERE A SECOND LATER LOST IN THE DARKNESS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRUSSIAN CAMP
DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK INDEED TO THAT WHICH IS INDELIBLY IMPRESSED UPON MY MEMORY ALL ARE GONE GONE AND I ALONE REMAIN AGED
THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY YOU TALK ABOUT BETSY BUTTERFLY HE EXPLODED HUH MISSUS LADYBUG SNIFFED YOU ARE A WORTHLESS PAIR BETSY BUTTERFLY'S WINGS
TO BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES I AM DEAD
BAH FATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNKIND TO ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD I FALLEN WITH FOUR OF MY COMRADES BULLETS IN MY BREAST
STOOD OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE GREY STORMY SKY AND UPON THE GROUND SNOW WAS LYING THICKLY HOUR AFTER HOUR DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK
THE TIN PAIL CONTAINING JOHNNIE'S BAIT SLIPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND CLATTERED UPON THE GROUND CAUSING TWINKLEHEELS TO RUN ALL THE FASTER THE FISH POLE STRUCK THE TREE TRUNKS RIGHT AND LEFT
A SHELL HAD FALLEN AND COMPLETELY WRECKED IT ROSE I CRIED ROSE I HAVE RETURNED
IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY HE MOVED TO BUFFALO WHERE HE CONTINUED IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW UNTIL EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN
AND SOONER OR LATER WE MUST SUCCUMB TO THE INEVITABLE THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND MOONLESS AS TO AND FRO I PACED ON SENTRY DUTY MY POST WAS A LONELY ONE
I'M EXPECTED TO WEAR MY COURT COSTUME EVERY DAY NONSENSE MISSUS LADYBUG RETORTED THE SOONER YOU GET SUCH SILLY NOTIONS OUT OF YOUR HEAD THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE
WELL YOUNG MAN SHE EXCLAIMED LOOKING AT BUSTER SEVERELY ARE YOU IDLING THIS LOVELY DAY AWAY YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE MAKING ANY HONEY
A SCAR I SHRIEKED IN DISMAY
AND WE MEET HERE AS ENEMIES AS ENEMIES HE REPEATED IN A STRANGE HARSH TONE YES LOUIS YOU ARE RIGHT HE ADDED BITTERLY AS ENEMIES
AGAINST TWINKLEHEELS HEAD I WON'T STAND THIS TWINKLEHEELS DECIDED I DON'T SEE WHAT JOHNNIE IS THINKING OF TO BEAT ME OVER THE HEAD I'VE CERTAINLY DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE SUCH TREATMENT
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS IN CONGRESS HE ROSE GRADUALLY TO THE FIRST RANK FOR INTEGRITY INDUSTRY AND PRACTICAL ABILITY
AS A STATE LEGISLATOR HE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY HIS ADVOCACY OF THE ACT TO ABOLISH IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT WHICH WAS DRAFTED BY HIM
JOLTED AS HE WAS HE COULDN'T GET A WHOLE WORD OUT OF HIS MOUTH AT A TIME HE COULD ONLY JERK A WORD OUT PIECEMEAL
WAS OF NO ACCOUNT ANYHOW FOR JOHNNIE WAS SO BUSY THAT HE DIDN'T HEAR A WORD OF HIS FATHER'S ADVICE TWINKLEHEELS HAD REACHED THE ORCHARD AND ALREADY WAS TEARING IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES
WHEN HE SET OUT ON FOOT FOR BUFFALO WHERE HE ARRIVED WITH JUST FOUR DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AH METHINKS PEOPLE WHO SAW THAT BOY MUST HAVE FELT THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BE SOMEBODY IN THE WORLD
AT THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR MISTER FILLMORE ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN SUCH CASES BECAME
NEITHER DO MEN LIGHT A CANDLE AND PUT IT UNDER A BUSHEL BUT ON A CANDLESTICK AND IT GIVETH LIGHT UNTO ALL THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE HOW OFTEN
THE GIRL REPLIED IN HER GASCON ACCENT LAST NIGHT A MAN CALLED FOR HER AND SHE WENT OUT LEAVING A NOTE FOR YOU A MAN I CRIED DESCRIBE HIM WHAT WAS HE LIKE
AND DO OUR DUTY WE KNEW WELL THAT TO HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN THOSE DARK DECEMBER DAYS THE CITY WAS STARVING OUR COUNTRY HAD BEEN OVERRUN BY THE PRUSSIAN LEGIONS
HIS ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE WAS A SUCCESSFUL ONE AND HAD HE NOT SIGNED THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW HE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE BEEN THE NOMINEE OF HIS PARTY AT THE CONVENTION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
EVERYBODY OUGHT TO WORK TOO MUCH PLAY IS BAD FOR FOLKS BUSTER BUMBLEBEE COULD FEEL HIMSELF FLUSHING THE NEIGHBORS WERE NOT EXPECTED TO ADDRESS A QUEEN'S SON IN THAT FASHION
IF THE FISH POLE HADN'T AT LAST SNAPPED OFF SHORT LEAVING ONLY THE BUTT OF IT IN JOHNNIE'S HAND THERE'S NO TELLING WHEN TWINKLEHEELS WOULD HAVE STOPPED
AND JOHNNIE GREEN ALL BUT LOST HIS SEAT ON TWINKLEHEELS BACK
ALL OBSTACLES THUS FAR WILL WE THEN BE SURPRISED WHEN WE READ THAT NO SOONER DID HE ARRIVE IN BUFFALO THAN HE SUCCEEDED
HOLD HE GASPED IN FRENCH IN A LOW HOARSE TONE
SPIES I HEARD ONE OF OUR MEN EXCLAIM
THAT OBSTACLE WAS OVERCOME HE NEXT MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RETIRED LAWYER BY WHICH HE RECEIVED HIS BOARD FOR SERVICES AND STUDIED NIGHTS THIS CONTINUED FOR TWO YEARS
THOUGH NOW SO NEAR THE WOMAN I LOVED I SAW VERY LITTLE OF HER INDEED
BLUE EYED FAIR HAIRED FROM WHOM I HAD BEEN TORN AWAY ERE OUR HONEYMOON WAS SCARCELY OVER HOW I WONDERED WAS SHE FARING
FROM A CANTER TO A TROT FROM A TROT TO A WALK AND FINALLY STOOD STILL THEN JOHNNIE TURNED HIM AROUND AND RODE SLOWLY BACK TO THE BARN
TO THINK A THING IMPOSSIBLE IS TO MAKE IT SO AND HE ACCORDINGLY SET TO WORK CONTRIVING TO GAIN FOR HIMSELF AN EDUCATION CONTRACTING WITH HIS EMPLOYER TO PAY HIM THIRTY DOLLARS FOR HIS RELEASE
IF YOU RAISE AN ALARM MY FATE IS SEALED IF YOU ALLOW US TO PROCEED TWO LIVES WILL BE MADE HAPPY DO YOU CONSENT GRASPING MY HAND HE PRESSED IT HARD ADDING
WHY ARE YOU HERE I INQUIRED BREATHLESSLY
WHOM I HAD FIRST MET IN COLOGNE
FOR ON TURNING SHARPLY MY EYES SUDDENLY DETECTED SOME INDISTINCT OBJECT
AND AN OUTLAW UNTIL TO DAY WHAT YOU ASK HAS BECOME OF HER FAR AWAY IN A SECLUDED VALLEY IN THE HARZ UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MYSTIC BROCKEN
AND THE WHOLE PLACE VIBRATED
FOR STILL UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH AS A SPY
YET AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN HE PRESUMED TO ASPIRE TO BECOME A LAWYER HE HAD TWO MORE YEARS TO SERVE IN HIS APPRENTICESHIP BUT WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE REPLIED QUICKLY IT IS A LOVE ESCAPADE LET ME GET AWAY QUICKLY BEYOND THE WALLS AND NO ONE WILL KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DETECTED ME SEE OVER THERE
TOWARDS THE SHADY WOOD A FILM GATHERS IN MY EYES AND I AM CARRIED BACK INTO THE TERRIBLE PAST TO THOSE BLACK FATEFUL DAYS WHEN FRANCE LAY HELPLESS UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF THE INVADER
HE SAW THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS AFOOT AND FEELING QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF FUN HE WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A PART IN IT I HOPE JOHNNIE HAS SOME OATS FOR ME IN THAT BASKET HE THOUGHT
I'M GLAD I BROKE IT NOW I'LL LET JOHNNIE PULL ME DOWN TO A WALK BUT NOT TOO QUICKLY WITH JOHNNIE GREEN TUGGING STEADILY TWINKLEHEELS CHANGED FROM A RUN TO A CANTER
DO LOUIS FOR HER SAKE MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLANK OF ARMS BROKE THE QUIET THREE OFFICERS WERE APPROACHING GO
I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR RELIEF WHICH WOULD COME AT DAWN AS I TRAMPED ON I THOUGHT OF MY HOME AWAY IN THE CENTRE OF THE INERT TREMBLING CITY OF MY YOUNG WIFE
AND HE POINTED TO A PORTION OF THE WALL DEEP IN THE SHADOW THERE IS MY FIANCEE I HAVE DARED
AND MADE FOR THE ORCHARD WHOA CRIED JOHNNIE GREEN WHOA CRIED HIS FATHER STOP HIM HANG TO HIM DON'T LET HIM RUN
IF HE EXPECTS ME TO MIND TWINKLEHEELS SAID WITH A SNORT
DON'T YOU KNOW ME HAVE YOU SO SOON FORGOTTEN YOUR FELLOW STUDENT PAUL OLBRICH THE VOICE AND THE NAME CAUSED ME TO START YOU I CRIED PEERING INTO HIS FACE
OF WINGS BECAUSE MY POLKA DOT WING COVERS ARE ACTUALLY WINGS TOO ONLY FOLKS DON'T USUALLY CALL THEM BY THAT NAME HAVING SPREAD HER WINGS MISSUS LADYBUG DECIDED
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR HE MADE AN EXTENSIVE TOUR IN THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN STATES AND IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE AFTER AN EXCURSION THROUGH NEW ENGLAND HE SAILED FOR EUROPE
THE WORKERS IN OUR HIVE PROVIDE HONEY ENOUGH
THE NEXT DAY BUSTER BUMBLEBEE SET OUT FOR THE ORCHARD TO FIND MISSUS LADYBUG HE WANTED TO WARN HER TO STOP TALKING ABOUT BETSY BUTTERFLY BUT BUSTER HADN'T REALIZED
THAT IT REALLY DOES IN A GREAT MEASURE REST WITH OURSELVES WHETHER WE AMOUNT TO SOMETHING OR WORSE THAN NOTHING IN THE WORLD WE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS MAN FROM CHILDHOOD AND HAVE SEEN HIM OVERCOME
I PEERED IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED AND COULD JUST DISTINGUISH A FIGURE HIDDEN BY A CLOAK AND CLOSELY VEILED QUICK HE CONTINUED THERE IS NO TIME FOR REFLECTION
AND SO WEAK THAT OUR GREATCOATS FELT AS HEAVY AS MILLSTONES RESOLVED
AND IN THE SEMI DARKNESS DISCOVERING THE SCAR UPON HIS CHEEK THAT HE HAD RECEIVED IN THE FENCING SCHOOL AT KONIGSWINTER YOU PAUL MY BEST FRIEND ALAS THAT YOU ARE A PRUSSIAN
I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
MERCER HE LAUGHED EXCITEDLY YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE NO I'M NOT IN LOVE AND I WANT YOU TO HELP AND NOT ADMIRE THERE ARE ONLY CARSON AND MYSELF HERE YOU KNOW AND THE JOB'S TOO BIG FOR THE TWO OF US
WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
AND HER BOSOM RISING AND FALLING BENEATH THE VEIL OF PALE GOLD HAIR SHE WAS BREATHING WATER MERCER LITERALLY JERKED ME AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE POOL
I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
HE HURRIED ME ACROSS THE BROAD CONCRETE PORCH AND INTO THE HOUSE THROW THE CAP ANYWHERE AND COME ON TOO MUCH AMAZED TO COMMENT FURTHER I FOLLOWED MY FRIEND THIS WAS A WARREN MERCER I DID NOT KNOW
I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
A MOMENT LATER I WAS OFF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE AND TEARING DOWN THE CONCRETE WITH THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE BLACK WIND SHRIEKING AROUND THE WINDSHIELD OF MY LITTLE ROADSTER MY OWN SHACK WAS OUT OF THE CITY LIMITS
THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
AS I CLAMPED ON MY BRAKES A SWIFT SHADOW PASSED TWO OF THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I COULD LEAP FROM THE CAR THE BROAD FRONT DOOR WITH ITS ROUNDED TOP AND CIRCULAR GRILLED WINDOW WAS FLUNG WIDE AND MERCER CAME RUNNING TO MEET ME
YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE TRIP WAS WORTH WHILE HERE SHE IS WITH A GESTURE HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND I STARED FOLLOWING HIS GLANCE DOWN AT THE GREAT TILED SWIMMING POOL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE
LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
PORCELAIN I ASKED HOARSELY THE THING HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY EERY EFFECT HE LAUGHED WILDLY PORCELAIN WATCH LOOK MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR
BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
FROM SOMEWHERE OUT ON THE BLACK HEAVING ATLANTIC THE RAPID MUFFLED POPPING OF A SPEED BOAT'S EXHAUST DRIFTED CLEARLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
LATE THIS AFTERNOON I DECIDED TO GO FOR A LITTLE WALK ALONG THE BEACH MERCER BEGAN I HAD BEEN WORKING LIKE THE DEVIL SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING RUNNING SOME TESTS ON WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH I FELT THE NEED OF SOME FRESH SEA AIR
I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
WE WERE STANDING AT ONE SIDE OF THE POOL NEAR THE CENTER DIRECTLY OPPOSITE US SEATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL WAS A HUMAN FIGURE NUDE SAVE FOR A GREAT MASS OF TAWNY HAIR THAT FELL ABOUT HER LIKE A SILKEN MANTLE
GET IN YOUR CAR AND COME DOWN HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE COME JUST AS YOU ARE AND WHAT'S THE MATTER I MANAGED TO INTERRUPT HIM BURGLARS
I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
DARING A THOUSAND DANGERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRAW PACKED BOTTLES THEY CARRIED SEA BRONZED MEN WITH HARD FLAT MUSCLES AND FEARLESS EYES READY GUNS SLAPPING THEIR THIGHS AS THEY
I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE HER HER I ASKED STARTLED
CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
