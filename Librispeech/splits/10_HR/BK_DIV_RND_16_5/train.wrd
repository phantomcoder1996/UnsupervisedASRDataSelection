WELL THEN IF SOUTH BRAINTREE VOUCHES FOR MISS VINER OH BUT ONLY INDIRECTLY
I HOPE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL LISTEN TO MY REASONS THERE'S BEEN TIME ON BOTH SIDES TO THINK THEM OVER SINCE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF BACK AND HUNG HELPLESS ON THE SINCE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ELUSIVE DAYS WHEN THE FAMILIAR FORMS OF THINGS SEEM ABOUT TO DISSOLVE IN A PRISMATIC SHIMMER THE STILLNESS WAS PRESENTLY BROKEN BY JOYFUL BARKS AND DARROW TRACKING THE SOUND
IF THE EPISODE HAD BEEN AN ISOLATED ACCIDENT
SOPHY'S BLUSH DEEPENED
TO PERSUADE HER TO DRIVE DIRECTLY TO THE BOIS FOR DINNER
IS THAT THE WAY THEY MADE YOU FEEL DIDN'T THEY YOU AS IF THE GODS WERE THERE ALL THE WHILE JUST BEHIND THEM PULLING THE STRINGS HER HANDS WERE PRESSED AGAINST THE RAILING HER FACE SHINING AND DARKENING UNDER THE WING BEATS OF SUCCESSIVE IMPRESSIONS
THEN HER FACE LEANED TO HIS WITH THE SLOW DROOP OF A FLOWER HE FELT AGAIN THE SWEEP OF THE SECRET TIDES AND ALL HIS FEARS WENT DOWN IN THEM
AND HIS MEETING WITH MISSUS LEATH THE PREVIOUS SPRING HAD GIVEN IT A DEFINITE DIRECTION WITH SUCH A COMRADE TO FOCUS AND STIMULATE HIS ENERGIES HE FELT MODESTLY BUT AGREEABLY SURE OF
AFTER ALL HE HAD FELT ALL THAT LONG AGO
THEN YOU MIGHT NATURALLY FEEL YOURSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER THAT YOU DON'T THINK I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR EFFIE HE UTTERED A SOUND OF PROTEST BUT SHE DISREGARDED IT I DON'T SAY YOU'D LIKE TO DO IT YOU WOULDN'T YOU'D HATE IT
MORE DISCONCERTINGLY TO HER COMPANION AND MORE PERILOUSLY TO HERSELF BE A SHIFTING AND UNCRYSTALLIZED MIXTURE OF THEM ALL HER TALK AS USUAL HAD PROMPTLY REVERTED TO THE STAGE
WHEN AT LENGTH SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF ANNA PROPOSED A GAME OF CARDS AND AFTER THIS DIVERSION HAD DRAWN TO ITS LANGUID CLOSE SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO DARROW AND FOLLOWED MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS BUT MADAME DE CHANTELLE NEVER SAT UP LATE
ALL THESE THINGS CAME BACK TO HIM AS HE SAT BESIDE HER IN THE THEATRE AND WATCHED HER INGENUOUS ABSORPTION IT WAS ON THE STORY THAT HER MIND WAS FIXED AND IN LIFE ALSO HE SUSPECTED
OR WINDING THROUGH THE PALE GOLD OF NARROW WOOD ROADS WITH THE BLUE OF CLEAR CUT HILLS AT THEIR END OVER EVERYTHING LAY A FAINT SUNSHINE THAT SEEMED DISSOLVED IN THE STILL AIR
THEN YOU NEVER REALLY SAW ANYTHING OF HER THERE
AND STOOD UP AND LOOKED DOWN ON HIM SMILING FAINTLY HE SAT STILL ABSORBING THE LOOK AND THINKING THERE'LL BE EVENINGS AND EVENINGS TILL SHE CAME NEARER BENT OVER HIM
NOT ME I HOPE NO NOT YOU I LIKE YOU IT'S THE MONEY WITH ME THAT'S ALWAYS THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
IF HE SUSPECTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER MIGHT WONDER AT HIS STEP MOTHER'S SUITOR BEING ENGAGED AT SUCH AN HOUR IN PRIVATE TALK WITH HER LITTLE GIRL'S GOVERNESS
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE TO STOP AND THINK WHETHER ONE CAN AFFORD A TELEGRAM BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO CONSIDER SUCH THINGS AND I MUSTN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER NOW
ONLY I SHALL BE SORRY HE ENDED OH BUT I SHALL BE SORRY TOO
AND FELT THAT THIS FACT SOMEHOW JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED HIS INSTINCTIVE BOYISH SATISFACTION IN LOVING HER HE STOOD UP
THE APPLICATION OF THE SAME METHOD TO THE SUBJECT OF OWEN'S FUTURE HIS GRANDMOTHER HAVING NO SUSPICION OF THE REAL REASON OF SOPHY VINER'S DEPARTURE HAD THOUGHT IT EXTREMELY SUITABLE OF THE YOUNG GIRL TO WITHDRAW TO THE SHELTER OF HER OLD FRIENDS ROOF IN THE HOUR OF BRIDAL PREPARATION
WELL THANK GOD YOU'RE OUT OF IT NOW AGAIN A JUST PERCEPTIBLE SHADOW CROSSED HER FACE YES I'M OUT OF IT NOW FAST ENOUGH
THE HAIR STOOD UP FROM HER FOREHEAD IN A BOYISH ELF LOCK
WHICH AT THE TIME HAD SEEMED TO SIMPLIFY THE INCIDENT NOW TURNED OUT TO BE ITS MOST GALLING COMPLICATION THE BARE TRUTH INDEED WAS THAT HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF HER AT ALL EITHER AT THE TIME OR SINCE AND THAT HE WAS ASHAMED TO BASE HIS JUDGEMENT OF HER
WHAT ABOUT ME WELL WHETHER IT WAS YOU OR SHE WHO HE WINCED BUT HID HIS DISAPPROVAL IT MADE THE TIME PASS TO LISTEN TO HER AND WHAT IF ONE MAY ASK WAS YOUR CONCLUSION
IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT HIS ODD IRREGULAR FEATURES SEEMED TO GROW FLUID TO UNMAKE AND REMAKE THEMSELVES LIKE THE SHADOWS OF CLOUDS ON A STREAM DARROW THROUGH THE RAPID FLIGHT OF THE SHADOWS COULD NOT SEIZE ON ANY SPECIFIC INDICATION OF FEELING
THANK YOU THANK YOU MOST AWFULLY FOR TELLING ME AND FOR ALL YOUR OTHER KIND INTENTIONS THE PLAN'S DELIGHTFUL REALLY QUITE DELIGHTFUL AND I'M EXTREMELY FLATTERED AND OBLIGED
THE DOOR OPENED AND SOPHY VINER ENTERED SEEING DARROW SHE DREW BACK DO COME IN MISS VINER ANNA REPEATED LOOKING AT HER KINDLY THE GIRL A QUICK RED IN HER CHEEKS STILL HESITATED ON THE THRESHOLD I'M SO SORRY
RETURNED HIS GREETING ALMOST GAILY HIS FIRST GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND THE CHANGE IN HER APPEARANCE GAVE HIM THE MEASURE OF HER FEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW IN HER AGAIN THE SIDELONG GRACE THAT HAD CHARMED HIS EYES IN PARIS
LED DARROW TO THROW OUT LAUGHINGLY TO SEE THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL YOU'RE MARRIED
MADAME DE CHANTELLE WAS RESTING BUT WOULD BE DOWN FOR DINNER AND AS FOR OWEN ANNA SUPPOSED HE WAS OFF SOMEWHERE IN THE PARK
AND DARROW HAD LED MISS VINER OUT ON THE BALCONY OVERHANGING THE SQUARE BEFORE THE THEATRE HE TURNED TO SEE IF SHE SHARED HIS FEELINGS BUT THE RAPTUROUS LOOK SHE GAVE HIM CHECKED THE DEPRECIATION ON HIS LIPS OH WHY DID YOU BRING ME OUT HERE ONE OUGHT TO CREEP AWAY AND SIT IN THE DARK TILL IT BEGINS AGAIN
WAS ONCE FOR ALL TO TURN BACK WITH HIM TO ITS CONTEMPLATION AS SOON AS THIS DESIRE HAD GERMINATED
BUT IS THERE IN SUCH A CASE ANY RECOMMENDATION WORTH HALF AS MUCH AS YOUR OWN DIRECT EXPERIENCE
THAT YOU PUT IT ALL IN THE PAST TENSE
SHE FORMULATED WITH A FERVENT LUCIDITY EVERY POINT IN HER IMAGINARY ARGUMENT BUT AS SOON AS SHE WAS ALONE WITH HIM SOMETHING DEEPER THAN REASON AND SUBTLER THAN SHYNESS LAID ITS BENUMBING TOUCH UPON HER AND THE DESIRE TO SPEAK BECAME MERELY A DIM DISQUIETUDE
AS IF SPELL BOUND BY THE PLAY OF MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S NEEDLES AND THE PULSATIONS OF OWEN'S FITFUL MUSIC
CLOTHES AND FUN AND MOTORS AND ADMIRATION AND YACHTING AND PARIS WHY PARIS ALONE WOULD BE ENOUGH
ONLY JUST WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY OWEN LIKE SOPHY VINER HAD THE KIND OF FACE WHICH SEEMS LESS THE STAGE ON WHICH EMOTIONS MOVE THAN THE VERY STUFF THEY WORK IN
ONCE AT THE TURN OF A WALL THEY STOPPED THE MOTOR BEFORE A RUINED GATEWAY AND STUMBLING ALONG A ROAD FULL OF RUTS STOOD BEFORE A LITTLE OLD DESERTED HOUSE FANTASTICALLY CARVED AND CHIMNEYED WHICH LAY IN A MOAT UNDER THE SHADE OF ANCIENT TREES
BUT THIS IS GOOD BYE YOU KNOW I MUST TELEGRAPH AT ONCE TO SAY I'M COMING TO SAY YOU'RE COMING THEN I'M NOT FORGIVEN OH YOU'RE FORGIVEN IF THAT'S ANY COMFORT
AND SOON AFTER LUNCHEON THE THREE SET FORTH IN THE MOTOR TO SHOW DARROW A CHATEAU FAMOUS IN THE ANNALS OF THE REGION DURING THEIR EXCURSION ANNA FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS FROM HIS DEMEANOUR IF EFFIE'S PRESENCE BETWEEN THEM WAS AS MUCH OF A STRAIN TO HIS COMPOSURE AS TO HERS
BUT HER OBSERVER WAS LESS STRUCK BY THIS THAN BY THE CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OWEN LEATH THE LATTER WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING UNCONCERNEDLY WITH EFFIE
WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD DEPART FOR THEIR NEW POST THE NIGHT BROUGHT NO AID TO THE SOLVING OF THIS PROBLEM BUT IT GAVE HIM AT ANY RATE THE CLEAR CONVICTION THAT NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST HIS FIRST STEP MUST BE TO OBTAIN FROM MISS VINER
AND THERE'S NO EARTHLY USE IN SITTING HERE WAITING SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM IN PERPLEXITY BUT WHEN I WROTE YESTERDAY I ASKED THEM TO TELEGRAPH I SUPPOSE THEY'RE HORRIBLY HARD UP THE POOR DEARS
SHE TURNED ABOUT ON HER HEEL AND DROPPING INTO THE NEAREST CHAIR SANK FORWARD HER FACE HIDDEN AGAINST THE DRESSING TABLE
THE NEXT DAY WAS EVEN BETTER HE FELT AND KNEW SHE FELT THAT THEY HAD REACHED A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER
THE LOOK WAS SO FUGITIVE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHEREIN IT DIFFERED FROM HER NORMAL PROFESSIONAL AIR OF HAVING HER PUPIL ON HER MIND EFFIE SPRANG PAST THEM AND DARROW TOOK UP THE GIRL'S CHALLENGE
HE KNEW THAT MOST WRONGDOING WORKS ON THE WHOLE LESS MISCHIEF THAN ITS USELESS CONFESSION
AND VEILED THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE LANDSCAPE IN SOFT UNCERTAINTY IN SUCH A SOLITUDE ANNA HAD FANCIED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SPEAK BUT AS SHE WALKED BESIDE DARROW OVER THE DEEP SOUNDLESS FLOORING OF BROWN MOSS THE WORDS ON HER LIPS TOOK FLIGHT AGAIN
IMPORTANT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT OF COURSE OF COURSE BUT YOU'VE EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED HAVEN'T YOU
INTENTIONS HE STOOD UP WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM AND TURNED BACK TO WHERE SHE STILL SAT MOTIONLESS
BUT HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WITH THE SECURING OF MISS VINER'S PEACE OF MIND ONLY A PART OF HIS OBLIGATION WAS DISCHARGED AND THAT WITH THAT PART HIS REMAINING DUTY WAS IN CONFLICT IT HAD BEEN HIS FIRST BUSINESS TO CONVINCE THE GIRL
TILL HE PUT AN ARM ABOUT HER SAYING YOU MUSTN'T STAY TILL YOU'RE CHILLED
HE PASSED OVER THE OBVIOUS REPLY BUT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW THE PROFESSION IS OVER CROWDED I KNOW I'M TRITE I'VE A VERY CLEAR IDEA BUT I COULDN'T GO ON AS I WAS
SHE LAID THE CASE BEFORE HIM WITH A COLD LUCIDITY I SHOULD IN YOUR PLACE I BELIEVE SHE ENDED WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I SHOULDN'T FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER BEHIND YOUR BACK IF I THOUGHT YOU UNSUITED FOR THE PLACE
IN ORDER THAT THE REUNITED FAMILY MIGHT HAVE THE END OF THE AFTERNOON TO THEMSELVES HE ROAMED THE COUNTRY SIDE TILL LONG AFTER DARK
LESS OF HER WORDS THAN OF HER LOOK AND OF THE EFFORT THE QUESTION COST HER THE REDDENING OF HER CHEEK THE DEEPENING OF THE STRAINED LINE BETWEEN HER BROWS
HER RAPT PROFILE BETRAYED NO UNREST
SHE OFTEN USED TO COME TO MY ROOM AFTER TENNIS OR TO TOUCH UP IN THE EVENINGS WHEN THEY WERE GOING ON AND I ASSURE YOU
YES ALL IS AT AN END BETWEEN US WE'VE JUST PARTED IN TEARS BUT NOT IN SILENCE JUST PARTED
WHEN SHE WAS WITH A MISSUS MURRETT YES AN APPALLING WOMAN WHO RUNS A ROARING DINNER FACTORY THAT USED NOW AND THEN TO CATCH ME IN ITS WHEELS I ESCAPED FROM THEM LONG AGO BUT IN MY TIME THERE USED TO BE HALF A DOZEN FAGGED HANDS TO TEND THE MACHINE
AND WAS RESOLUTELY BENT ON HOLDING HER TO HER OWN PURPOSE OF BEHAVING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED ONCE MORE SHE INWARDLY ACCUSED HIM OF INSENSIBILITY AND HER IMAGINATION WAS BESET BY TORMENTING VISIONS OF HIS PAST HAD SUCH THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
SHE STOOD UP WITH A SMILING HEAD SHAKE
SHE LOOKED UP AND THEIR EYES EXCHANGED MEANINGS FOR A RAPID MINUTE
SHE PAUSED AGAIN AND THEN EXCLAIMED
YOU LIKE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'D NEVER DARE UN SHE BROKE THE WORD IN TWO AND HER QUICK BLUSH MADE HER FACE LIKE A SHALLOW PETALLED ROSE
EVERYTHING ENTERTAINED AND INTERESTED HER AND DARROW REMARKED WITH AN AMUSED DETACHMENT
OH ON THAT SCORE I'M AFRAID I SHA'N'T BE OF MUCH USE
HE DREW HER TO HIM WITH A SMILE ON THAT CONDITION I'M PREPARED TO LOVE EVEN ADELAIDE PAINTER I ALMOST HOPE YOU WONT HAVE THE CHANCE TO POOR ADELAIDE HER APPEARANCE HERE ALWAYS COINCIDES WITH A CATASTROPHE OH THEN I MUST MANAGE TO MEET HER ELSEWHERE
ANNA SMILED OH WE HEARD OF HER THROUGH ADELAIDE PAINTER
BUT ONLY AN INGENUOUS WONDER HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY TOUCHED BY HER EXPRESSION OH DO YOU MUST LISTEN TO PROVE THAT I'M SINCERE I'LL TELL YOU I'LL TELL YOU I DIDN'T POST YOUR LETTER I DIDN'T POST IT BECAUSE I WANTED SO MUCH TO GIVE YOU A FEW GOOD HOURS
THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER AND CALMER TALK AND HE RESOLVED TO SEEK IT AT THE EARLIEST HOUR HE HAD GATHERED THAT EFFIE'S LESSONS WERE PRECEDED BY AN EARLY SCAMPER IN THE PARK
ONE OF THE DUMB APPENDAGES OF THE SHRIEKING UNESCAPABLE MISSUS MURRETT INTO WHOSE TALONS HE HAD FALLEN IN THE COURSE OF HIS HEAD LONG PURSUIT OF LADY ULRICA CRISPIN
OR TO CONFESS HER YIELDING IN THAT WAY AT FIRST HE WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED THEN HE SAW HOW HER ATTITUDE SIMPLIFIED HIS OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAD ALL THE INDECISION AND AWKWARDNESS OF INEXPERIENCE IT SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A CHILD AFTER ALL AND ALL HE COULD DO
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU SO EMPHATICALLY REFUSED TO LET ME HELP YOU TO A START SHE STOPPED SHORT AND FACED HIM AND YOU THINK I MAY LET YOU NOW DARROW FELT THE BLOOD IN HIS CHEEK HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER ATTITUDE
YES FROM GIRLS WHO'VE ONLY GOT TO CHOOSE HER EYES HAD GROWN SUDDENLY ALMOST OLD I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THE ONLY MEN WHO'VE EVER WANTED TO MARRY ME
SUCH AT ANY RATE WAS THE CONCLUSION HE HAD REACHED WHEN SHORTLY AFTER THE TWO LADIES LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HE BADE OWEN GOOD NIGHT AND WENT UP TO HIS ROOM
TILL LATE IN THE NIGHT HIS THOUGHTS REVOLVED IN A TURMOIL OF INDECISION HIS PRIDE WAS HUMBLED BY THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT SOPHY VINER HAD BEEN TO HIM AND WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER THIS DISCREPANCY
HE FELT LIKE ANSWERING
AH SAID OWEN ABRUPTLY SETTING DOWN HIS CUP HE STOOD UP LIT ANOTHER CIGARETTE AND WANDERED AWAY TO THE PIANO IN THE ROOM BEYOND
FOR A MOMENT IT OCCURRED TO DARROW THAT ANNA MIGHT HAVE EMPLOYED HER AFTERNOON IN PREPARING MADAME DE CHANTELLE FOR HER GRANDSON'S IMPENDING ANNOUNCEMENT BUT A GLANCE AT THE ELDER LADY'S UNCLOUDED BROW SHOWED THAT HE MUST SEEK ELSEWHERE THE CLUE TO OWEN'S TACITURNITY
SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE SMILED AT HER SCRUPLES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AS SHE LOOKED BACK ON THEM THEY SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE OLD IGNORANT TIMOROUS TIME WHEN SHE HAD FEARED TO LOOK LIFE IN THE FACE AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO THE MYSTERIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART BECAUSE HER OWN HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
IT'S NOT INDEED REAL COMPASSION PROMPTED HIM TO CONTINUE HAVE YOU ANY ANY INFLUENCE YOU CAN COUNT ON SHE GAVE A SOMEWHAT FLIPPANT LITTLE LAUGH NONE BUT MY OWN I'VE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER TO COUNT ON
HE CRIED THROWING OUT HIS HANDS WITH A LAUGH HER FACE INSTANTLY MELTED TO LAUGHTER WELL THEN I WON'T BE SORRY I WON'T REGRET ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT OUR GOOD TIME IS OVER THE WORDS WERE SO UNEXPECTED THAT THEY ROUTED ALL HIS RESOLVES
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO NOT EVEN THAT ONLY HER READER HER READER DO YOU MEAN TO SAY SHE EVER READS
PRESENTLY HER NURSE APPEARED AND ANNA ROSE AT THE SAME TIME
IN FACT IT CAN ONLY BE SHE WENT ON WITH ONE OF HER DISCONCERTING FLASHES OF ASTUTENESS FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS EITHER BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU OUGHT TO HELP ME OR BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO MISSUS LEATH TO LET HER KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW OF ME
BUT AS HIS EYE FELL ON MISS VINER HIS EXPRESSION ALTERED AS SUDDENLY AS HERS THE CHANGE FOR DARROW WAS LESS DEFINABLE BUT PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON IT STRUCK HIM AS MORE SHARPLY SIGNIFICANT
BUT THE WISH ISN'T DUE TO TO ANY PAST KINDNESS ON YOUR PART BUT SIMPLY TO MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU WHY NOT PUT IT THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE YOUR BENEFIT
IT ANNOYED HIM AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT TO BE REMINDED THAT NATURALNESS IS NOT ALWAYS CONSONANT WITH TASTE SHE SEEMED TO GUESS HIS THOUGHT
OH NOW OWEN NOW I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE I'LL EVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN I AM NOW LET OWEN HAVE HIS TEA FIRST HER MOTHER SUGGESTED BUT THE YOUNG MAN DECLINING THE OFFER PROPPED HIS GUN AGAINST THE WALL AND LIGHTING A CIGARETTE
SUCH TRUSTFULNESS SEEMED OPEN TO SUSPICION BUT THE MOMENT HIS EYES FELL ON HER HE WAS ASHAMED OF THE THOUGHT AND KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT REALLY WAS ANOTHER PRETEXT TO LESSEN HIS OWN DELINQUENCY WHY SHOULD OUR GOOD TIME BE OVER HE ASKED
TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT'S NOT ALWAYS MAY AND PARIS WHY NOT MAKE THE MOST OF THEM NOW YOU KNOW ME WE'RE NOT STRANGERS WHY SHOULDN'T YOU TREAT ME LIKE A FRIEND WHILE HE SPOKE SHE HAD DRAWN AWAY A LITTLE BUT HER HAND STILL LAY IN HIS
SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE SIGNED TO A MOTOR CAB CALLING OUT TO THE DRIVER TO THE BOIS AS THE CARRIAGE TURNED TOWARD THE TUILERIES SHE ROUSED HERSELF I MUST GO FIRST TO THE HOTEL THERE MAY BE A MESSAGE AT ANY RATE I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING
BUT BENEATH THE SURFACE OF HER SERENITY HIS TENSE PERCEPTIONS DETECTED A HIDDEN STIR HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY SELF POSSESSED TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DOUBTLESS DUE TO CAUSES WITH WHICH HE WAS NOT DIRECTLY CONCERNED
AS HE STOOD THERE IN THE LAMP LIGHT WITH DEAD LEAVES AND BITS OF BRAMBLE CLINGING TO HIS MUD SPATTERED CLOTHES THE SCENT OF THE NIGHT ABOUT HIM AND ITS CHILL ON HIS PALE BRIGHT FACE HE REALLY HAD THE LOOK OF A YOUNG FAUN STRAYED IN FROM THE FOREST EFFIE ABANDONED THE TERRIER TO FLY TO HIM
SHE TRIED TO DEVISE MEANS OF KEEPING THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY THE NURSE FOUND AN EXCUSE FOR FOLLOWING MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS TO THE PURPLE SITTING ROOM
AND HIS STEP MOTHER'S CONCERN POSSIBLY ANNA HAD FOUND REASON TO CHANGE HER OWN ATTITUDE IN THE MATTER AND HAD MADE THE CHANGE KNOWN TO OWEN BUT THIS AGAIN WAS NEGATIVED BY THE FACT THAT DURING THE AFTERNOON'S SHOOTING
AND HE WALKED ON IN SILENCE AT MISS VINER'S SIDE PRESENTLY HE WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT OWEN LEATH AND THE GIRL WERE SILENT ALSO AND THIS GAVE A NEW TURN TO HIS THOUGHTS SILENCE MAY BE AS VARIOUSLY SHADED AS SPEECH
WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER BUT JUST THIS MUST I GO NOW HE ADDED ALOUD SHE ANSWERED ABSENTLY IT MUST BE TIME TO DRESS
IS THIS IT DARROW ASKED PICKING UP A BOOK FROM THE TABLE OH THANK YOU
IN FACT I USED TO SAY TO JIMMY JUST TO MAKE HIM WILD
THERE WAS IN THEM AN UNDEFINABLE APPEAL WHETHER FOR HELP OR FORBEARANCE HE COULD NOT TELL THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MISLEADING IN HIS SO POINTEDLY SEEKING HER AND HE FELT A MOMENTARY CONSTRAINT
AS LIFE AFTER THIS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF FLIGHT AND HE TOOK HER BACK TO THE THEATRE CONTENT TO RECEIVE HIS OWN SENSATIONS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HERS BUT WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE PLAY AND THE OPPRESSION OF THE HEAVY AIR HIS ATTENTION AGAIN BEGAN TO WANDER
HE HAD DONE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE TO REASSURE THE GIRL AND SHE HAD APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED THE SINCERITY OF HIS INTENTION HE HAD PATCHED UP AS DECENT A CONCLUSION AS HE COULD TO AN INCIDENT THAT SHOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD NO SEQUEL
HE MERELY PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS UNACCOUNTABLY SURPRISED AT FINDING HIM WITH MISS VINER AND THAT THE EXTENT OF HIS SURPRISE MIGHT COVER ALL MANNER OF IMPLICATIONS DARROW'S FIRST IDEA WAS THAT OWEN
EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THEY HAD GONE OUT IN THE MOTOR TRAVERSING MILES OF SOBER TINTED LANDSCAPE IN WHICH HERE AND THERE
AND THE NATURAL ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO TRY TO PERSUADE ME THAT I'D BE BETTER OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN HERE BUT SUPPOSING THAT FAILED AND YOU SAW I WAS DETERMINED TO STAY THEN YOU MIGHT THINK IT YOUR DUTY TO TELL MISSUS LEATH
WHERE'S MISS VINER HE ASKED AS EFFIE CLIMBED UP ON HIM
BUT OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME SHE WAS SAYING MY NAME IS VINER SOPHY VINER
THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT AN EQUAL ACTIVITY OF INTERCOURSE WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE OF IT SOMETHING WAS IN FACT PASSING MUTELY AND RAPIDLY BETWEEN YOUNG LEATH AND SOPHY VINER
YOU'LL TELL ME ABOUT THAT THEN WON'T YOU HER SMILE FLICKERED UP OH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IT SOON I MUST CATCH EFFIE NOW AND DRAG HER BACK TO THE BLACKBOARD
DARROW STOOD STILL IN THE PATH BEHIND HIM HE HEARD EFFIE'S CALL AND AT THE CHILD'S VOICE HE SAW SOPHY TURN HER HEAD WITH THE ALERTNESS OF ONE WHO IS OBSCURELY ON THE WATCH
THEY DINED LATE AND FACING HER ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ITS LOW LIGHTS AND FLOWERS
SHE BROKE OFF CONFUSED AND HE QUESTIONED WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THE COLOUR ROSE TO HER FOREHEAD HOW COULD SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE SCARCELY DARED OWN TO HERSELF
THE RETREAT IN WHICH AS ONE MIGHT FANCY
WAIT A MINUTE PLEASE MISS VINER ANNA SAID
I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING SHE REPEATED
BUT NO HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN JUDGING THE PERFORMANCE TO BE DULL AND STALE IT WAS SIMPLY HIS COMPANION'S INEXPERIENCE HER LACK OF OCCASIONS TO COMPARE AND ESTIMATE THAT MADE HER THINK IT BRILLIANT
WHATEVER WORDS HE CHOSE HE SEEMED TO STUMBLE AMONG REMINDERS OF THEIR PAST SHE WALKED ON BESIDE HIM HER EYES ON THE GROUND THEN I'M TO UNDERSTAND DEFINITELY THAT YOU DO RENEW YOUR OFFER SHE ASKED
MINGLED WITH THESE SENSATIONS WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF ANOTHER ORDER HE REFLECTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN WITH WHOM ONE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC
IT'S NOT A BIT LIKE YOU TO LET ANYTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR SAYING JUST WHAT YOU FEEL
IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT DEAL IT'S WHAT SHE'D ALREADY ASKED ME HIS VOICE SHOWED HER HOW DEEPLY HE WAS MOVED AND A THROB OF JEALOUSY SHOT THROUGH HER OH IT WAS FOR YOUR SAKE I KNOW HE MADE NO ANSWER AND SHE ADDED
AND YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A FAINT SMILE I'M NOT THINKING OF THE STAGE I'VE HAD ANOTHER OFFER THAT'S ALL THE RELIEF WAS HARDLY LESS GREAT
WHEN THEY CAME IN THEY SAT BESIDE THE FIRE IN THE OAK DRAWING ROOM AND DARROW NOTICED HOW DELICATELY HER HEAD STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SOMBRE PANELLING AND MUSED ON THE ENJOYMENT THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE MERE FACT OF WATCHING HER HANDS AS THEY MOVED ABOUT AMONG THE TEA THINGS
AND SHE SEEMED TO CATCH THE PERCEPTION IN HIS EYES THAT'S THE KIND OF EDUCATION I GOT AT MISSUS MURRETT'S AND I NEVER HAD ANY OTHER SHE SAID WITH A SHRUG GOOD LORD WERE YOU THERE SO LONG
BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN A WAY THAT REMINDED DARROW OF HIS OWN CAGED WANDERINGS EFFIE PURSUED HIM WITH HER BLANDISHMENTS
AS FOR THE PRIVATE AND PERSONAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE IT HAD COME UP TO THE CURRENT STANDARDS AND IF IT HAD DROPPED NOW AND THEN BELOW A MORE IDEAL MEASURE EVEN THESE DECLINES HAD BEEN BRIEF PARENTHETIC INCIDENTAL
OF WHICH ANNA COULD HARDLY YET BEAR TO CONSIDER THE VAGUEST OUTLINE THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF SAILING FROM LONDON OR LISBON THE POSSIBILITY OF HIRING A HABITABLE HOUSE AT THEIR NEW POST AND WHEN THESE PROBLEMS WERE EXHAUSTED
SHE HUNG HER HEAD IN MEDITATION BUT I CAN'T STAY HOW CAN I STAY SHE BROKE OUT AS IF ARGUING WITH SOME UNSEEN MONITOR WHY CAN'T YOU
TO THE DISMAL DRUDGERY OF TEACHING AND IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD MISSUS LEATH SHE RUSHED THE QUESTION OUT AT HIM AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO TRIP HIM UP OVER IT HE WAS MOVED BY THE SIMPLICITY OF THE STRATAGEM
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT MISS VINER ABOUT MISS VINER HE SUMMONED UP A LOOK OF FAINT INTERROGATION HE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED SURPRISED AT HIS SURPRISE IT'S IMPORTANT NATURALLY SHE EXPLAINED
IN THE HALL COMING DOWN THE STAIRS HE ENCOUNTERED ANNA HER FACE WAS SERENE
FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PAST SURGED UP IN HIM CONFUSEDLY THEN A VEIL DROPPED BETWEEN THEM HERE'S EFFIE NOW SHE EXCLAIMED HE TURNED AND SAW THE LITTLE GIRL TROTTING BACK TO THEM HER HAND IN OWEN LEATH'S
I USED TO PASS YOU ON THE STAIRS SHE REMINDED HIM YES
HER CHIN ON HER HANDS WHAT RUBBISH WE TALK ABOUT INTENTIONS THE TRUTH IS I HADN'T ANY I JUST LIKED BEING WITH YOU PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY ONE CAN LIKE BEING WITH YOU I WAS DEPRESSED AND ADRIFT MYSELF AND YOU MADE ME FORGET MY BOTHERS
SHE HUNG BEFORE HIM LIKE A LEAF ON THE MEETING OF CROSS CURRENTS THAT THE NEXT RIPPLE MAY SWEEP FORWARD OR WHIRL BACK
TELL ME JUST WHAT YOU THINK HE SAID BENDING HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND ONLY HALF AWARE OF HIS WORDS SHE DID NOT TURN HER FACE TO HIS BUT BEGAN TO TALK RAPIDLY TRYING TO CONVEY SOMETHING OF WHAT SHE FELT
ON HIS MEAGRE MEMORY OF THEIR ADVENTURE THE ESSENTIAL CHEAPNESS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AS FAR AS HIS SHARE IN IT WAS CONCERNED CAME HOME TO HIM WITH HUMILIATING DISTINCTNESS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT AT THE TIME AT LEAST
NOR DARROW TO THE TEMPTATION OF BELITTLING HER IN THE EFFORT TO BETTER HIS OWN CASE THE GIRL HAD BEEN MAGNIFICENT AND THE ONLY WORTHY RETURN THAT ANNA COULD MAKE WAS TO TAKE DARROW FROM HER WITHOUT A QUESTION IF SHE TOOK HIM AT ALL
THROUGH WHICH HIS LOOKS HIS WORDS HIS TOUCH REACHED HER AS THROUGH A MIST OF BODILY PAIN YET THIS INERTIA WAS TORN BY WILD FLASHES OF RESISTANCE AND WHEN THEY WERE APART SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE AGAIN WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY TO HIM
AND THE GIRLISH THINNESS OF HER NECK ABOVE THE SLIGHT SWELL OF THE BREAST HIS IMAGINATION WAS STRUCK BY THE QUALITY OF RETICENCE IN HER BEAUTY
BUT HIS SENSE OF HER WORDS WAS LOST IN THE SURPRISE OF HER FACE UNDER THE FLYING CLOUDS OF HER EXCITEMENT IT WAS NO LONGER A SHALLOW FLOWER CUP BUT A DARKENING GLEAMING MIRROR THAT MIGHT GIVE BACK STRANGE DEPTHS OF FEELING THE GIRL HAD STUFF IN HER HE SAW IT
HE REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY GOOD HUMOURED AND APPRECIATIVE WHILE THEY WENT THE ROUND OF THE MONUMENT AND SHE REMARKED ONLY THAT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNNOTICED HIS FACE GREW GRAVE AND HIS ANSWERS CAME LESS PROMPTLY
AT DINNER THAT EVENING MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S SLENDER MONOLOGUE WAS THROWN OUT OVER GULFS OF SILENCE OWEN WAS STILL IN THE SAME STATE OF MOODY ABSTRACTION AS WHEN DARROW HAD LEFT HIM AT THE PIANO AND EVEN ANNA'S FACE TO HER FRIEND'S VIGILANT EYE
HER LONG RESIDENCE ON GALLIC SOIL HAD NOT MITIGATED HER HOSTILITY TOWARD THE CREED AND CUSTOMS OF THE RACE BUT THOUGH SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS THE SCARLET WOMAN AND TOOK THE DARKEST VIEWS OF FRENCH PRIVATE LIFE
AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A STORM OR SOME OTHER NATURAL CATACLYSM SHE HAD NO LITERARY OR HISTORIC ASSOCIATIONS TO WHICH TO ATTACH HER IMPRESSIONS HER EDUCATION HAD EVIDENTLY NOT COMPRISED A COURSE IN GREEK LITERATURE
REFLECTING THE FRESHNESS OF THE SEASON SUGGESTED DAPPLINGS OF SUNLIGHT THROUGH NEW LEAVES THE SOUND OF A BROOK IN THE GRASS THE RIPPLE OF TREE SHADOWS OVER BREEZY MEADOWS WHEN AT LENGTH THE FATEFUL MARCH OF THE COTHURNS WAS STAYED BY THE SINGLE PAUSE IN THE PLAY
AT ANY RATE BEAT ABOUT THE CASE AS HE WOULD IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE OWED IT TO ANNA AND INCIDENTALLY TO HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND TO FIND SOME WAY OF SECURING SOPHY VINER'S FUTURE
SHE THOUGHT WITH A PANG OF BITTERNESS HE WON'T GROW ANY OLDER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FEEL THINGS AND BECAUSE HE DOESN'T I SHALL AND WHEN SHE CEASED TO PLEASE HIM WHAT THEN HAD HE THE TRADITION OF FAITH TO THE SPOKEN VOW
STRAYING BACK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE MORNING HE HAD BEEN WITH SOPHY VINER ALL DAY AND HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HOW QUICKLY THE TIME HAD GONE SHE HAD HARDLY ATTEMPTED AS THE HOURS PASSED
AND SO FAR I'VE HAD NO CAUSE TO REGRET MY CHOICE BUT I KNOW AFTER ALL VERY LITTLE ABOUT MISS VINER AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY I WANT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT MORE TO FIND OUT ALL I CAN
DEAR NO BUT I WROTE NOTES AND MADE UP THE VISITING BOOK AND WALKED THE DOGS AND SAW BORES FOR HER DARROW GROANED THAT MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER BAD
HE HAD STAKED SOMETHING MORE ON IT AND HAD SOMEHOW IN THE SEQUEL HAD A MORE PALPABLE LOSS TO SHOW BUT THE PLAIN FACT WAS THAT HE HADN'T SPENT A PENNY ON IT WHICH WAS NO DOUBT THE REASON OF THE PRODIGIOUS SCORE IT HAD SINCE BEEN ROLLING UP
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
ALL THE DIFFERENCE HE WAS A LITTLE TIRED OF EXPERIMENTING ON LIFE HE WANTED TO TAKE A LINE TO FOLLOW THINGS UP TO CENTRALIZE AND CONCENTRATE AND PRODUCE RESULTS TWO OR THREE MORE YEARS OF DIPLOMACY WITH HER BESIDE HIM
YOU'D STUCK IT OUT LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS COULDN'T YOU AT LEAST HAVE HELD ON TILL YOU WERE SURE OF SOME KIND OF AN OPENING
AND SHE'S HEARD WHAT SHE CALLS DELIGHTFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU SO
DARROW AND SOPHY MOUNTED TOGETHER IN THE LIFT AND THE YOUNG MAN
AND BECAUSE I COULDN'T BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO HE HAD THE FEELING THAT THE WORDS WERE BEING UTTERED IN SPITE OF HIM BY SOME MALICIOUS WITNESS OF THE SCENE AND YET THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE THEM SPOKEN THE GIRL HAD LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE
OVERTOOK EFFIE FLYING DOWN ONE OF THE LONG ALLEYS AT THE HEAD OF HER PACK BEYOND HER HE SAW MISS VINER SEATED NEAR THE STONE RIMMED BASIN BESIDE WHICH HE AND ANNA HAD PAUSED ON THEIR FIRST WALK TO THE RIVER THE GIRL COMING FORWARD AT HIS APPROACH
THEY HAD GAINED AN INLET IN THE SHADES OF A CLIFF WHERE THEY COULD FLOAT ON THE STILL SURFACE AND GAZE FAR DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS NOW AND THEN AS THEY WALKED AND TALKED
BUT SHE FELT WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPERCEIVED BY MANY A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FIRST IN CLASSICS THE INELUCTABLE FATALITY OF THE TALE THE DREAD SWAY IN IT OF THE SAME MYSTERIOUS LUCK WHICH PULLED THE THREADS OF HER OWN SMALL DESTINY
HE LEANED BACK IMPATIENTLY STIFLING ANOTHER YAWN AND TRYING TO FIX HIS ATTENTION ON THE STAGE GREAT THINGS WERE GOING FORWARD THERE
YET THERE WAS NO HARD EDGE OF VANITY IN HER SENSE OF HER PRETTINESS SHE SEEMED SIMPLY TO BE AWARE OF IT AS A NOTE IN THE GENERAL HARMONY AND TO ENJOY SOUNDING THE NOTE AS A SINGER ENJOYS SINGING AFTER LUNCHEON AS THEY SAT OVER THEIR COFFEE
AND THE SECOND EVENING WITH THE AMIABLY IMPLIED INTENTION OF LEAVING ANNA AND DARROW TO THEMSELVES SHE TOOK AN EARLIER LEAVE OF THEM THAN USUAL ANNA SAT SILENT LISTENING TO HER SMALL STIFF STEPS AS THEY MINCED DOWN THE HALL AND DIED OUT IN THE DISTANCE
ACCUSED HER OF HYPNOTIZING THE PROFESSOR BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER WE WERE ALL INVISIBLE TO YOU BUT WE COULD SEE AND WE ALL USED TO WONDER ABOUT YOU
DARROW ACQUIESCED AND THEY GOT OUT AND SENT EFFIE ON IN THE MOTOR THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A BIT OF SOBER FRENCH WOODLAND FLAT AS A FADED TAPESTRY BUT WITH GLEAMS OF LIVE EMERALD LINGERING HERE AND THERE AMONG ITS BROWNS AND OCHRES
ONE LOOKS IN ONE'S GLASS AFTER ALL
THERE WAS NOTHING SHE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW NO FOLD OR CRANNY OF HIS SECRET THAT HER AWAKENED IMAGINATION DID NOT STRAIN TO PENETRATE BUT SHE COULD NOT EXPOSE SOPHY VINER TO THE BASE FINGERINGS OF A RETROSPECTIVE JEALOUSY
HER OUTBURST DID NOT OFFEND THE YOUNG MAN
AND THE PLEASURE YOU'LL BE GIVING ME LET'S SHAKE HANDS ON IT
IF SHE HAD GONE ON DOUBTING HIM HE COULD PROBABLY HAVE GONE ON DECEIVING HER
ON THE BRIGHT HAZE OF EFFIE'S HAIR AND ON THE WHITENESS OF ANNA'S FOREHEAD AS SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR BEHIND THE TEA URN SHE DID NOT MOVE AT DARROW'S APPROACH BUT LIFTED TO HIM A DEEP GAZE OF PEACE AND CONFIDENCE THE LOOK SEEMED TO THROW ABOUT HIM THE SPELL OF A DIVINE SECURITY
BUT WHAT WOULD IMPEL OR RESTRAIN HIM AT THE CRUCIAL HOUR SHE PUT NO FAITH IN HER OWN ARTS SHE WAS TOO SURE OF HAVING NONE AND IF SOME BENEFICENT ENCHANTER HAD BESTOWED THEM ON HER SHE KNEW NOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE REJECTED THE GIFT
NO SHE HEARD FROM ADELAIDE THAT I WAS IN PARIS AND SHE CAME SHE CAME BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO URGE ME TO MARRY YOU
HE LOOKED YOUNG ACTIVE STORED WITH STRENGTH AND ENERGY NOT THE MAN FOR VAIN REPININGS OR LONG MEMORIES SHE WONDERED WHAT SHE HAD TO HOLD OR SATISFY HIM HE LOVED HER NOW SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THAT BUT HOW COULD SHE HOPE TO KEEP HIM
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR MADE THEM DRAW APART
AND THE LOOSE HAIR UNDER HER HAT BRIM CLUNG TO HER FOREHEAD IN DAMP RINGS SHE LOOKED LIKE A YOUNG PRIESTESS STILL DAZED BY THE FUMES OF THE CAVERN YOU POOR CHILD IT'S BEEN ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A VAGUE SMILE
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING A TELEGRAM HAD COME FROM OWEN LEATH
SHE THREW THE WORDS OFF WITH A HALF IRONIC SMILE
I'M AWFULLY MODERN YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST WHEN SHE PROCLAIMED HERSELF MOST AWFULLY MODERN THAT SHE STRUCK HIM AS MOST HELPLESSLY BACKWARD YET THE MOMENT AFTER
DARROW TOOK A CHAIR BEHIND THE LITTLE GIRL SO THAT HE MIGHT LOOK ACROSS AT HER MOTHER IT WAS ALMOST A NECESSITY FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT TO LET HIS EYES REST ON ANNA'S FACE AND TO MEET NOW AND THEN THE PROUD SHYNESS OF HER GAZE MADAME DE CHANTELLE PRESENTLY ENQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF OWEN
WHO WAS THERE IN YOUR TIME MISSUS BOLT AND MADEMOISELLE AND PROFESSOR DIDYMUS AND THE POLISH COUNTESS
UNLUCKILY SHE COULDN'T AT THE MOMENT PUT HER HAND ON A SWEET AMERICAN
DARROW HAD SAID YOU WERE MADE TO FEEL EVERYTHING AND TO FEEL WAS SURELY BETTER THAN TO JUDGE WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE WAS ALREADY IN THE OAK ROOM WITH EFFIE AND MADAME DE CHANTELLE
THEN SHE SNATCHED AWAY HER HAND YOU DIDN'T POST MY LETTER YOU KEPT IT BACK ON PURPOSE AND YOU TELL ME SO NOW TO PROVE TO ME THAT I'D BETTER PUT MYSELF UNDER YOUR PROTECTION
OH IT'S NOT THAT SHE EXCLAIMED ALMOST IMPATIENTLY IT'S NOT PEOPLE I'M AFRAID OF THEY'VE NEVER PUT THEMSELVES OUT FOR ME WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEM HE LIKED HER DIRECTNESS AS HE HAD NEVER LIKED IT BEFORE WELL THEN WHAT IS IT
AND NOT THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN ME SINCE AND NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SINCE AND SHE BELIEVES YOU SHE COMPLETELY BELIEVES YOU HE UTTERED A PROTESTING EXCLAMATION AND HIS FLUSH REFLECTED ITSELF IN THE GIRL'S CHEEK
IS THAT ALL HE LAUGHED RELIEVED BY HER NATURALNESS LOOK HERE
I'VE TOLD HER EXACTLY NOTHING HE REPLIED AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY NOTHING YOU AND SHE WERE TALKING ABOUT ME WHEN I CAME INTO HER SITTING ROOM YESTERDAY DARROW FELT HIS BLOOD RISE AT THE THRUST
TO WALK AFTER HER DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATRE
LOSING ITS LOOK OF APPEALING CONFIDENCE WAS SUDDENLY SHARPENED BY DISTRUST YOU DIDN'T FORGET TO POST MY LETTER
AT THE SAME MOMENT A DOUBT SHOT UP ITS SERPENT HEAD IN HIS OWN BOSOM
HIS LIFE ON THE WHOLE HAD BEEN A CREDITABLE AFFAIR OUT OF MODEST CHANCES AND MIDDLING TALENTS HE HAD BUILT HIMSELF A FAIRLY MARKED PERSONALITY KNOWN SOME EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE
THEY'RE SURE TO SEND FOR ME IN A DAY OR TWO NOW HE BEGAN SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE CONTINUED YOU'LL TELL ME BEFORE I GO WHAT DAY I'M TO COME BACK AND GET YOU
AND INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HIM SHE BROKE OUT THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WANTING YOU TO KNOW THE OTHER DAY IN PARIS I SAW MISS VINER SHE SAW HIM FLUSH WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS SURPRISE YOU SENT FOR HER
DARROW STOOD UP I'M GLAD YOU'VE TOLD ME HE SPOKE WITH A VISIBLE EFFORT AT COMPOSURE HER EYES FOLLOWED HIM AS HE MOVED AWAY IS THAT ALL HE ASKED AFTER AN INTERVAL
AND WHO HAD BEEN DESCRIBED TO HIM AS SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES OF HUMOUR AS TO ANNA'S FANCIED PERTURBATION IT MIGHT SIMPLY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HAD DECIDED TO PLEAD OWEN'S CAUSE THE NEXT DAY AND HAD PERHAPS ALREADY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AWAITING HER
OH MISSUS MURRETT'S WAS IT THERE HE REMEMBERED HER NOW OF COURSE REMEMBERED HER AS ONE OF THE SHADOWY SIDLING PRESENCES IN THE BACKGROUND OF THAT AWFUL HOUSE IN CHELSEA
SHE KNEW HE COULD NOT BE WITH HER WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF THIS INNER TURMOIL AND SHE HOPED HE WOULD BREAK THE SPELL BY SOME RELEASING WORD BUT SHE PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE FUTILITY OF WORDS
THE GESTURE HAD ACTED ON DARROW'S NUMB FEELINGS AS THE GLOW OF THE FIRE ACTED ON HIS CIRCULATION AND WHEN HE HAD ASKED AREN'T YOUR FEET WET TOO AND AFTER FRANK INSPECTION OF A STOUT SHOD SOLE SHE HAD ANSWERED CHEERFULLY
AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND TO HIDE HIS SURPRISE HE ADDED LIGHTLY AH THEN YOU WILL HAVE PARIS AFTER ALL
THE OLD DELUSION I SUPPOSE
SHE WAS EAGER TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY FORM OF DRAMATIC EXPRESSION WHICH THE METROPOLIS OF THINGS THEATRICAL HAD TO OFFER AND HER CURIOSITY RANGED FROM THE OFFICIAL TEMPLES OF THE ART TO ITS LESS HALLOWED HAUNTS HER SEARCHING ENQUIRIES ABOUT A PLAY WHOSE PRODUCTION
I WALKED MILES AND MILES WITH NURSE AND COULDN'T FIND YOU AND WE MET JEAN AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D GONE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE I GO OR WHAT I SEE WHEN I GET THERE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT HE LAUGHED BACK AT HER BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD HE ADDED
LOOK THERE ARE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
THEY WERE SO NEARLY OF AN AGE THAT ALREADY SHE FELT HERSELF HIS SENIOR AS YET THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT VISIBLE OUTWARDLY AT LEAST THEY WERE MATCHED
INSTANTLY EFFACED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF PURSUIT WELL THEN HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON HER HIS EYES PERSUADING HER HE WAS NOW INTENSELY AWARE THAT HIS NEARNESS WAS HAVING AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT LESS AND LESS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AND HE WENT ON
BUT FRASER LEATH HAD GROWN SO UNIMPORTANT A FACTOR IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THAT THESE MARKS OF HIS PRESENCE CAUSED THE YOUNG MAN NO EMOTION BEYOND THAT OF A FAINT RETROSPECTIVE AMUSEMENT THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HAD BEEN PERFECT
NO THERE'S NOTHING HE FEIGNED AN UNREGRETFUL SURPRISE SO MUCH THE BETTER AND NOW SHALL WE DRIVE OUT SOMEWHERE OR WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE A BOAT TO BELLEVUE HAVE YOU EVER DINED THERE ON THE TERRACE BY MOONLIGHT IT'S NOT AT ALL BAD
I DIDN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A FEW HOURS TOGETHER FIRST SO I LEFT YOUR LETTER IN MY POCKET HE SAW HER FACE MELT AS SHE LISTENED AND SUDDENLY SHE UNCLASPED HER HANDS AND LEANED TO HIM BUT ARE YOU UNHAPPY TOO
FINALLY DREW HIM TO HIS FEET FROM HER WRITING TABLE WHERE SHE SAT OVER A PILE OF LETTERS ANNA LIFTED HER HAPPY SMILE THE IMPULSE TO PRESS HIS LIPS TO IT MADE HIM COME CLOSE AND DRAW HER UPWARD SHE THREW HER HEAD BACK
SHE WAS RESOLVED TO KEEP ON HER COURSE AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED TO MARRY DARROW AND NEVER LET THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PAST INTRUDE ITSELF BETWEEN THEM BUT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY OF ATTAINING TO THIS STATE OF DETACHMENT FROM THE IRREPARABLE
AND SO WOULD THE TIGER MEANWHILE SUCH EXPERTNESS QUALIFIED BY SUCH CANDOUR MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS THE EXTENT OF HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR TO ESTIMATE ITS EFFECT ON HER CHARACTER SHE MIGHT BE ANY ONE OF A DOZEN DEFINABLE TYPES OR SHE MIGHT
THAT HE FELL BACKWARD IN HIS CHAIR IN A STATE OF EXHAUSTION
HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS
CRIED KIT WITH A RUEFUL FACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT MOTHER I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SHE SAID IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP
SAID MISTER WITHERDEN YOU CAME TO WORK OUT THAT SHILLING NOT TO GET ANOTHER HEY NO INDEED SIR REPLIED KIT TAKING COURAGE TO LOOK UP I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING FATHER ALIVE
AND IN SO DOING LOST ONE OF THE SHOES FOR EVER MISTER ABEL BEING IN A THOUGHTFUL FRAME OF MIND AND HAVING QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP THE PONY GOING WENT JOGGING ON WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND LITTLE DREAMING OF THE STRANGE FIGURE THAT WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM
THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT AND PICKING HIS STEPS AS IF HE WERE SPYING ABOUT FOR THE CLEANEST PLACES AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE COTTAGE WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LITTLE SPIRES AT THE GABLE ENDS AND PIECES OF STAINED GLASS IN SOME OF THE WINDOWS ALMOST AS LARGE AS POCKET BOOKS ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS A LITTLE STABLE
SAID THE SERVANT GIRL KIT GOT OFF THE BOX AND SAID YES HE WAS I'M AFRAID YOU'VE RUNG A GOOD MANY TIMES PERHAPS SHE REJOINED BUT WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN CATCHING THE PONY
AND AFTER THAT THEY ALL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM TOGETHER WHICH KIT FEELING VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY MADE A PRETENCE OF NOT OBSERVING THEREFORE HE PATTED THE PONY MORE AND MORE AND THIS LIBERTY THE PONY MOST HANDSOMELY PERMITTED
OR DISHONESTLY FEIGN TO LOSE THE BOX UPON THE ROAD SECONDLY WHETHER KIT'S MOTHER PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF IN THE ABSENCE OF HER SON I DON'T THINK THERE'S HARDLY A CHANCE OF HIS REALLY LOSING IT
ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER SAID KIT LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT WITH A WEARY AIR AND SIGHING AS HE SPOKE THEY HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK
BUT CARRIERS ARE UNDER GREAT TEMPTATION TO PRETEND THEY LOSE THINGS NO DOUBT SAID MISSUS NUBBLES APPREHENSIVELY IN REFERENCE TO THE FIRST POINT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT RETURNED KIT WITH A SERIOUS LOOK UPON MY WORD MOTHER
AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING THANK YOU SIR KIT REPLIED AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
AN'T THAT AS NAT'RAL AS WALKING AND AS GOOD FOR THE HEALTH HA HA HA AN'T THAT AS NAT'RAL AS A SHEEP'S BLEATING OR A PIG'S GRUNTING OR A HORSE'S NEIGHING OR A BIRD'S SINGING HA HA HA ISN'T IT MOTHER THERE WAS SOMETHING CONTAGIOUS IN KIT'S LAUGH
PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
HIS GUIDE WHO APPEARED TO UNDERSTAND HIS RELUCTANCE TRIMMED THE CANDLE AND TAKING IT IN HER HAND APPROACHED THE BED AS SHE DID SO THE SLEEPER STARTED UP AND HE RECOGNISED IN THE WASTED FACE THE FEATURES
I WISH I HAD THE REWARDING OF YOU I DO WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING SAID MISTER ABEL TYING A SHAWL ROUND HIS NECK AS HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS HE'S ENOUGH TO FRET A MAN'S HEART OUT REPLIED THE HOSTLER
OR TO TAKE A CRUISE ROUND THE WORLD IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE EVER WAS A BOX WHICH WAS OPENED AND SHUT SO MANY TIMES WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AS THAT WHICH CONTAINED HIS WARDROBE AND NECESSARIES AND CERTAINLY
CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
WHICH IS CALLING ITS DEAD FATHER NAMES IF I WAS TO SEE THIS AND SEE LITTLE JACOB LOOKING GRIEVOUS LIKEWISE I SHOULD SO TAKE IT TO HEART THAT I'M SURE I SHOULD GO AND LIST FOR A SOLDIER AND RUN MY HEAD ON PURPOSE AGAINST THE FIRST CANNON BALL I SAW COMING MY WAY
I SAID I'D BE HERE SIR SAID KIT PATTING WHISKER'S NECK I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT RIDE SIR HE'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PONY MY
SAID THE NOTARY DEAD SIR MOTHER YES SIR MARRIED AGAIN EH KIT MADE ANSWER NOT WITHOUT SOME INDIGNATION THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW WITH THREE CHILDREN
PERHAPS I MAY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT YOU SO TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL PUT IT DOWN IN MY POCKET BOOK
LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS
REJOINED THE OLD LADY A VERY GOOD LAD AND I AM SURE HE IS A GOOD SON KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH
AND CLUSTERED ABOUT THE DOOR AND THE GARDEN WAS BRIGHT WITH FLOWERS IN FULL BLOOM WHICH SHED A SWEET ODOUR ALL ROUND AND HAD A CHARMING AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE EVERYTHING WITHIN THE HOUSE AND WITHOUT
IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE
THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY
HE WAS GONE IN AN INSTANT AND THE MARCHIONESS RETURNING FROM LIGHTING HIM DOWN STAIRS REPORTED THAT THE PONY WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY OBJECTION WHATEVER HAD DASHED AWAY AT FULL GALLOP THAT'S RIGHT SAID DICK
SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS AN UNCOMMON LAD A GOOD LAD I'M SURE I'M SURE HE IS REJOINED THE OLD LADY
IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE WHY BLESS ME CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE LAD IS HERE MY DEAR DO YOU SEE
FLEW OFF EVERY NOW AND THEN AND WERE DIFFICULT TO FIND AGAIN AMONG THE CROWD OF PASSENGERS INDEED THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE EXPERIENCED SO MUCH TROUBLE AND DELAY FROM HAVING TO GROPE FOR THESE ARTICLES OF DRESS IN MUD AND KENNEL
SAID HIS GUIDE IN AN EARNEST WHISPER OH YOU'D SAY IT WAS IF YOU HAD ONLY SEEN HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO MISTER ABEL MADE NO ANSWER AND TO SAY THE TRUTH KEPT A LONG WAY FROM THE BED AND VERY NEAR THE DOOR
AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR
NOR INDULGED IN ANY ECCENTRIC PERFORMANCES UNTIL THEY ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF MISTER SWIVELLER'S LODGING WHERE MARVELLOUS TO RELATE HE CONSENTED TO STOP WHEN MISTER ABEL CHECKED HIM
AND BARBARA'S BIBLE BARBARA'S LITTLE LOOKING GLASS HUNG IN A GOOD LIGHT NEAR THE WINDOW AND BARBARA'S BONNET WAS ON A NAIL BEHIND THE DOOR FROM ALL THESE MUTE SIGNS AND TOKENS OF HER PRESENCE HE NATURALLY GLANCED AT BARBARA HERSELF
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE
YOU MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO HEAR OF YOUR RICHARD ON HIS BIER BUT FOR THE FRIEND I SENT TO FETCH YOU ANOTHER SHAKE OF THE HAND MARCHIONESS IF YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN SIR MISTER ABEL SEEMED RATHER ASTONISHED TO HEAR OF THE QUALITY OF HIS GUIDE
AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND LADY CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN
AFTER RECOVERING TWICE OR THRICE
HE'LL NEVER STAND STILL IF YOU CALL HIM NAMES SAID MISTER ABEL GETTING IN AND TAKING THE REINS HE'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIM THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS BEEN OUT THIS LONG WHILE FOR HE HAS LOST HIS OLD DRIVER
AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT
AND BEFORE ASSISTANCE COULD BE RENDERED COMMENCED BACKING AT NEARLY AS QUICK A PACE AS HE HAD GONE FORWARD BY THESE MEANS MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS PUSHED AND HUSTLED TO THE OFFICE AGAIN IN A MOST INGLORIOUS MANNER AND ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXHAUSTION AND DISCOMFITURE
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES
THAT THE BRIM SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY WHEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF PROMISE AND ADVICE AND KIT HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF ASSURANCE AND THANKFULNESS HE WAS HANDED OVER AGAIN TO THE OLD LADY
AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG
SAID THE MARCHIONESS POINTING TO ONE WHERE THERE WAS A FAINT LIGHT COME MISTER ABEL WHO WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST RETIRING CREATURES IN EXISTENCE AND NATURALLY TIMID WITHAL HESITATED
THAT BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE STREET IN WHICH THE NOTARY LIVED SHE WAS FAIRLY WORN OUT AND EXHAUSTED AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TEARS BUT TO HAVE GOT THERE AT LAST WAS A GREAT COMFORT ESPECIALLY AS THERE WERE LIGHTS STILL BURNING IN THE OFFICE WINDOW
AND HAD AFFORDED BY HIS APPEARANCE UNLIMITED SATISFACTION HE WAS TAKEN INTO THE STABLE WHERE THE PONY RECEIVED HIM WITH UNCOMMON COMPLAISANCE AND THENCE INTO THE LITTLE CHAMBER HE HAD ALREADY OBSERVED WHICH WAS VERY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AND THENCE INTO THE GARDEN
RATHER WONDERING THAT HE ATTRACTED SO LITTLE ATTENTION AND ATTRIBUTING THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE INSENSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO GOT UP EARLY HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS ABEL COTTAGE WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ANY MORE REMARKABLE ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD
IF MATTER SO LOW COULD BE HEREIN SET DOWN KIT LEFT THE HOUSE AT AN EARLY HOUR NEXT MORNING AND SET OUT TO WALK TO FINCHLEY FEELING A SUFFICIENT PRIDE IN HIS APPEARANCE TO HAVE WARRANTED HIS EXCOMMUNICATION FROM LITTLE BETHEL FROM THAT TIME FORTH
BUT AT LAST AS HE WAS SITTING UPON THE BOX THINKING ABOUT GIANTS CASTLES AND PRINCESSES TIED UP TO PEGS BY THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS AND DRAGONS BURSTING OUT FROM BEHIND GATES AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE LIKE NATURE
BUT THE IMPULSE WAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THE VEXED LOOK BECAME A KIND ONE BEFORE IT HAD CROSSED THE ROOM THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK MOTHER HAS BECOME OF EM YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES AND AS THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM TICKLING HIS EAR AT THAT MOMENT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE RESTORATION OF MISS SALLY BRASS TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OVER HER PERSON NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE RISK SHE RAN HOWEVER THE MARCHIONESS NO SOONER LEFT THE HOUSE THAN SHE DIVED INTO THE FIRST DARK BY WAY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF
SHE BEGAN TO SHAPE HER COURSE FOR THE NOTARY'S OFFICE TO WHICH SHREWDLY INQUIRING OF APPLE WOMEN AND OYSTER SELLERS AT STREET CORNERS RATHER THAN IN LIGHTED SHOPS OR OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AT THE HAZARD OF ATTRACTING NOTICE
BEHIND THE PONY SAT THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN AND BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT THE LITTLE OLD LADY CARRYING JUST SUCH A NOSEGAY AS SHE HAD BROUGHT BEFORE THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD LADY THE PONY AND THE CHAISE
THAN MEETING A LAD IN A BRIMLESS HAT THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF HIS OLD ONE ON WHOM HE BESTOWED HALF THE SIXPENCE HE POSSESSED KIT ARRIVED IN COURSE OF TIME AT THE CARRIER'S HOUSE WHERE TO THE LASTING HONOUR OF HUMAN NATURE
AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
OF RICHARD SWIVELLER WHY HOW IS THIS SAID MISTER ABEL KINDLY AS HE HURRIED TOWARDS HIM YOU HAVE BEEN ILL VERY REPLIED DICK NEARLY DEAD
AND MISTER ABEL WHOM THEY HAD COME TO FETCH INTO HIS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER REASONING WITH THE PONY ON THE EXTREME IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT
NOT A WORD OF IT A SET OF IDLE CHATTERBOXES HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT
AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH
AND WHISPERED BEHIND THE NOSEGAY TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE BELIEVED THE LAD WAS AS HONEST A LAD AS NEED BE NOW SAID MISTER GARLAND WHEN THEY HAD MADE SOME FURTHER INQUIRIES OF HIM
AND WITHOUT ANY PRESENT REFERENCE TO THE POINT TO WHICH HER JOURNEY TENDED MADE IT HER FIRST BUSINESS TO PUT TWO GOOD MILES OF BRICK AND MORTAR BETWEEN HERSELF AND BEVIS MARKS WHEN SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS OBJECT
AND NETHER GARMENTS OF IRON GREY BESIDES THESE GLORIES HE SHONE IN THE LUSTRE OF A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS AND AN EXTREMELY STIFF AND SHINY HAT WHICH ON BEING STRUCK ANYWHERE WITH THE KNUCKLES SOUNDED LIKE A DRUM AND IN THIS ATTIRE
DON'T YOU SAY SO QUITE LONG ENOUGH KIT LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION
THERE NEVER WAS ONE WHICH TO TWO SMALL EYES PRESENTED SUCH A MINE OF CLOTHING AS THIS MIGHTY CHEST WITH ITS THREE SHIRTS AND PROPORTIONATE ALLOWANCE OF STOCKINGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS DISCLOSED TO THE ASTONISHED VISION OF LITTLE JACOB
AND THE OLD LADY HURRYING TO THE WINDOW CRIED THAT WHISKER HAD RUN AWAY UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
BY THESE MEANS MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS PUSHED AND HUSTLED TO THE OFFICE AGAIN IN A MOST INGLORIOUS MANNER AND ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXHAUSTION AND DISCOMFITURE THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT
NOTHING BUT THIS ASSURANCE COULD HAVE PREVAILED UPON THE SMALL NURSE TO INDULGE IN SUCH A LUXURY HAVING EATEN AND DRUNK TO MISTER SWIVELLER'S EXTREME CONTENTMENT GIVEN HIM HIS DRINK AND PUT EVERYTHING IN NEAT ORDER SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN AN OLD COVERLET
AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH COUPLED WITH THE ASSURANCE HE HAD RECEIVED FROM QUILP FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE
THIS PONY HAD A LITTLE PHAETON BEHIND HIM AND A MAN IN IT BUT NEITHER MAN NOR PHAETON SEEMED TO EMBARRASS HIM IN THE LEAST AS HE REARED UP ON HIS HIND LEGS OR STOPPED OR WENT ON OR STOOD STILL AGAIN OR BACKED
AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS THAN HE HUNG UP THE CAGE WITH GREAT PRECIPITATION AND HASTILY EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF HIS ERRAND WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
JUST AS THE FANCY SEIZED HIM
WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
KIT RATHER WONDERED WHAT THIS MEANT BUT AS HE COULDN'T STOP THERE ASKING QUESTIONS HE SHOULDERED THE BOX AGAIN AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL INTO THE HALL WHERE THROUGH A BACK DOOR HE DESCRIED MISTER GARLAND LEADING WHISKER IN TRIUMPH UP THE GARDEN
HE WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF CONDUCTED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED SICK CHAMBER WHERE A MAN WAS SLEEPING TRANQUILLY IN BED AN'T
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM
WHICH CALLS UPON ME TO BE A SNIVELLING SOLEMN WHISPERING CHAP SNEAKING ABOUT AS IF I COULDN'T HELP IT AND EXPRESSING MYSELF IN A MOST UNPLEASANT SNUFFLE ON THE CONTRARY DON'T I SEE EVERY REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T JUST HEAR THIS HA HA HA
AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS BUT THE IMPULSE WAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THE VEXED LOOK BECAME A KIND ONE BEFORE IT HAD CROSSED THE ROOM
UNTIL THE MARCHIONESS HAVING IN SOME DEGREE RECOVERED HER BREATH AND THE LOSS OF HER SHOE AND THE NOVELTY OF HER POSITION
I GOT IN BEHIND REPLIED THE MARCHIONESS OH PLEASE DRIVE ON SIR DON'T STOP AND GO TOWARDS THE CITY WILL YOU AND OH DO PLEASE MAKE HASTE BECAUSE IT'S OF CONSEQUENCE THERE'S SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU THERE
SAID KIT LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT WITH A WEARY AIR AND SIGHING AS HE SPOKE THEY HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY
WOKE THE BABY WHO FINDING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY JOVIAL AND AGREEABLE IN PROGRESS WAS NO SOONER IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS THAN IT BEGAN TO KICK AND LAUGH MOST VIGOROUSLY THIS NEW ILLUSTRATION OF HIS ARGUMENT SO TICKLED KIT
AND THEREFORE SOME HOPE THAT SHE WAS NOT TOO LATE SO THE MARCHIONESS DRIED HER EYES WITH THE BACKS OF HER HANDS AND STEALING SOFTLY UP THE STEPS PEEPED IN THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS STANDING BEHIND THE LID OF HIS DESK
MAKING SUCH PREPARATIONS TOWARDS FINISHING OFF FOR THE NIGHT AS PULLING DOWN HIS WRISTBANDS AND PULLING UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR SETTLING HIS NECK MORE GRACEFULLY IN HIS STOCK AND SECRETLY ARRANGING HIS WHISKERS BY THE AID OF A LITTLE TRIANGULAR BIT OF LOOKING GLASS
SAID KIT PATTING WHISKER'S NECK I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT RIDE SIR HE'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PONY MY DEAR SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS AN UNCOMMON LAD A GOOD LAD I'M SURE I'M SURE HE IS
UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM
TO EAT COLD MEAT AND DRINK SMALL ALE AND USE HIS KNIFE AND FORK THE MORE AWKWARDLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN UNKNOWN BARBARA LOOKING ON AND OBSERVING HIM IT DID NOT APPEAR HOWEVER
HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
I DON'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO TRUST IT TO ITSELF SOMEBODY OUGHT TO HAVE GONE WITH IT I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T HELP IT NOW SAID HIS MOTHER BUT IT WAS FOOLISH AND WRONG PEOPLE OUGHTN'T TO BE TEMPTED
AND AFTER THAT THEY ALL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM TOGETHER WHICH KIT FEELING VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY MADE A PRETENCE OF NOT OBSERVING THEREFORE HE PATTED THE PONY MORE AND MORE AND THIS LIBERTY THE PONY MOST HANDSOMELY PERMITTED
FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER
EVEN IN RUNNING AWAY HOWEVER WHISKER WAS PERVERSE
HE SENT ME TO SAY WOULD YOU COME DIRECTLY AND THAT HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT KIT AND COULD SAVE HIM YET AND PROVE HIS INNOCENCE WHAT DO YOU TELL ME CHILD THE TRUTH UPON MY WORD AND HONOUR I DO BUT PLEASE TO DRIVE ON QUICK PLEASE
UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED IT SEEMED THAT MISTER CHUCKSTER HAD BEEN STANDING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING CARELESSLY AT THE PONY AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS
WHOSE PREVIOUS GOOD OPINION OF HIM WAS GREATLY ENHANCED BY HIS WIPING HIS BOOTS ON THE MAT UNTIL THE SOLES OF HIS FEET BURNT AGAIN HE WAS THEN TAKEN INTO THE PARLOUR TO BE INSPECTED IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SURVEYED SEVERAL TIMES
OVERCAME EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION SO ENTRUSTING WHISKER TO THE CHARGE OF A MAN WHO WAS LINGERING HARD BY IN EXPECTATION OF THE JOB HE SUFFERED HIS COMPANION TO TAKE HIS HAND AND TO LEAD HIM UP THE DARK AND NARROW STAIRS
KIT TOLD HIM AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WROTE DOWN THE ADDRESS WITH HIS PENCIL HE HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT UPROAR IN THE STREET AND THE OLD LADY HURRYING TO THE WINDOW CRIED THAT WHISKER HAD RUN AWAY
KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT
SO DID THE MARCHIONESS FLUTTER ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL SHE BELIEVED HERSELF IN SAFETY AND THEN BEAR SWIFTLY DOWN UPON THE PORT FOR WHICH SHE WAS BOUND SHE HAD NO BONNET NOTHING ON HER HEAD BUT A GREAT CAP
INTIMATING THAT IF HE MIGHT VENTURE TO EXPRESS A WISH IT WOULD BE THAT THEY STOPPED THERE THE PONY MADE A MOMENT'S PAUSE BUT AS IF IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT TO STOP WHEN HE WAS REQUIRED MIGHT BE TO ESTABLISH AN INCONVENIENT AND DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
FOR HE HAD HEARD OF PEOPLE BEING DECOYED INTO STRANGE PLACES TO BE ROBBED AND MURDERED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES VERY LIKE THE PRESENT AND FOR ANYTHING HE KNEW TO THE CONTRARY BY GUIDES VERY LIKE THE MARCHIONESS HIS REGARD FOR KIT HOWEVER
IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING
HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY
OH KIT DON'T TALK LIKE THAT I WOULD INDEED MOTHER AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE ME FEEL VERY WRETCHED AND UNCOMFORTABLE YOU'LL KEEP THAT BOW ON YOUR BONNET WHICH YOU'D MORE THAN HALF A MIND TO PULL OFF LAST WEEK
NO INDEED SIR REPLIED KIT TAKING COURAGE TO LOOK UP I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING FATHER ALIVE SAID THE NOTARY DEAD SIR MOTHER YES SIR MARRIED AGAIN EH
AND LAY DOWN UPON THE RUG BEFORE THE FIRE MISTER SWIVELLER WAS BY THAT TIME MURMURING IN HIS SLEEP STREW THEN OH STREW A BED OF RUSHES
FOR HIS MOTHER WHO HAD LOOKED GRAVE BEFORE FIRST SUBSIDED INTO A SMILE AND THEN FELL TO JOINING IN IT HEARTILY WHICH OCCASIONED KIT TO SAY THAT HE KNEW IT WAS NATURAL AND TO LAUGH THE MORE KIT AND HIS MOTHER LAUGHING TOGETHER IN A PRETTY LOUD KEY
THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT AND MISTER ABEL WHOM THEY HAD COME TO FETCH INTO HIS
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE NOTARY'S DOOR THE MAN CALLED OUT IN A VERY RESPECTFUL MANNER
AFTER THAT SELF WILLED PONY HAD AS HE AFTERWARDS LEARNED DODGED THE FAMILY ROUND A SMALL PADDOCK IN THE REAR FOR ONE HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE OLD GENTLEMAN RECEIVED HIM VERY KINDLY AND SO DID THE OLD LADY
SHE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE HIM HEAR THE CASE WAS DESPERATE FOR THE PONY WAS QUICKENING HIS PACE THE MARCHIONESS HUNG ON BEHIND FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND FEELING THAT SHE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND MUST SOON YIELD
AND TELLING HIM HE WAS WANTED INSIDE BADE HIM GO IN AND HE WOULD MIND THE CHAISE THE WHILE IN GIVING HIM THIS DIRECTION MISTER CHUCKSTER REMARKED THAT HE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT BE BLESSED IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHETHER HE KIT
WHAT'S HIS NAME QUILP AND THAT HE AND MISS NELL HAVE GONE TO LIVE ABROAD WHERE IT CAN'T BE TAKEN FROM THEM AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
WHICH IN SOME OLD TIME HAD BEEN WORN BY SALLY BRASS WHOSE TASTE IN HEAD DRESSES WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN PECULIAR AND HER SPEED WAS RATHER RETARDED THAN ASSISTED BY HER SHOES WHICH BEING EXTREMELY LARGE AND SLIPSHOD
YOU SPEAK TRUE AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH AS YOU ALWAYS DO MOTHER STILL
THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ATTENTIVE TO THE TICKING OF THE SOBER CLOCK HE VENTURED TO GLANCE CURIOUSLY AT THE DRESSER AND THERE AMONG THE PLATES AND DISHES WERE BARBARA'S LITTLE WORK BOX WITH A SLIDING LID TO SHUT IN THE BALLS OF COTTON AND BARBARA'S PRAYER BOOK AND BARBARA'S HYMN BOOK
OR PRECIOUS DEEP BUT INTIMATED BY A DISTRUSTFUL SHAKE OF THE HEAD THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS
FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD PUT BY A LITTLE MONEY THAT NOBODY KNEW OF
AT THIS REPLY MISTER WITHERDEN BURIED HIS NOSE IN THE FLOWERS AGAIN AND WHISPERED BEHIND THE NOSEGAY TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE BELIEVED THE LAD WAS AS HONEST A LAD AS NEED BE NOW SAID MISTER GARLAND WHEN THEY HAD MADE SOME FURTHER INQUIRIES OF HIM
AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS STAND STILL
AND STOPPING THE PONY CRIED WITH SOME TREPIDATION
BUT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO AFTER THIS LONG DELAY EVERY MINUTE IS AN AGE IF EVER YOU WENT HOME FAST IN YOUR LIFE GO HOME FAST TO NIGHT DON'T STOP TO SAY ONE WORD TO ME BUT GO SHE WILL BE FOUND HERE
MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY WELL BOY SAID MISTER WITHERDEN YOU CAME TO WORK OUT THAT SHILLING NOT TO GET ANOTHER HEY
SEEMED TO BE THE PERFECTION OF NEATNESS AND ORDER IN THE GARDEN THERE WAS NOT A WEED TO BE SEEN AND TO JUDGE FROM SOME DAPPER GARDENING TOOLS A BASKET AND A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH WERE LYING IN ONE OF THE WALKS
HAVING MADE THESE OBSERVATIONS THE SMALL SPY TOOK COUNSEL WITH HERSELF AND RESOLVED TO WAIT IN THE STREET UNTIL MISTER ABEL CAME OUT AS THERE WOULD BE THEN NO FEAR OF HAVING TO SPEAK BEFORE MISTER CHUCKSTER AND LESS DIFFICULTY IN DELIVERING HER MESSAGE
PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
NOW TELL THIS GENTLEMAN ALL THAT YOU TOLD ME AND BE PARTICULAR DON'T YOU SPEAK ANOTHER WORD SIR THE STORY WAS REPEATED IT WAS IN EFFECT EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE WITHOUT ANY DEVIATION OR OMISSION
HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED OFF AGAIN RATTLED AT A FAST TROT TO THE STREET CORNER WHEELED ROUND CAME BACK AND THEN STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD OH YOU'RE A PRECIOUS CREATUR
AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PERHAPS I MAY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT YOU SO TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL PUT IT DOWN IN MY POCKET BOOK
CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
AND A VERY CHEERFUL MEAL THEIR SCANTY SUPPER WAS WITH MORE KISSES AND HUGS AND TEARS THAN MANY YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO START UPON THEIR TRAVELS AND LEAVE WELL STOCKED HOMES BEHIND THEM WOULD DEEM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF PROBABILITY
WHO SAT AS MUTE AS THEY SHELLING PEAS INTO A DISH AND JUST WHEN KIT WAS LOOKING AT HER EYELASHES AND WONDERING QUITE IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART WHAT COLOUR HER EYES MIGHT BE
AND HEARTY OF HIM AND I HONOUR HIM FROM THIS TIME BUT GET SOME SUPPER AND A MUG OF BEER FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST BE TIRED DO HAVE A MUG OF BEER IT WILL DO ME AS MUCH GOOD TO SEE YOU TAKE IT AS IF I MIGHT DRINK IT MYSELF
JUST THE SIZE FOR THE PONY WITH A LITTLE ROOM OVER IT JUST THE SIZE FOR KIT WHITE CURTAINS WERE FLUTTERING AND BIRDS IN CAGES THAT LOOKED AS BRIGHT AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF GOLD WERE SINGING AT THE WINDOWS PLANTS WERE ARRANGED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PATH
THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING REMARKABLY TREMENDOUS ABOUT THIS STRANGE BARBARA WHO HAVING LIVED A VERY QUIET LIFE BLUSHED VERY MUCH AND WAS QUITE AS EMBARRASSED AND UNCERTAIN WHAT SHE OUGHT TO SAY OR DO AS KIT COULD POSSIBLY BE WHEN HE HAD SAT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
NOW SIR WILL YOU HA THE GOODNESS TO GO ON THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING IT
RICHARD SWIVELLER KEPT HIS EYES FIXED ON HIS VISITOR DURING ITS NARRATION AND DIRECTLY IT WAS CONCLUDED TOOK THE WORD AGAIN YOU HAVE HEARD IT ALL AND YOU'LL NOT FORGET IT I'M TOO GIDDY AND TOO QUEER TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY RETURNED THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY I SAY
THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR
AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY BEHIND THE PONY SAT THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN AND BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT THE LITTLE OLD LADY CARRYING JUST SUCH A NOSEGAY AS SHE HAD BROUGHT BEFORE
AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE
HE FOUND THE BOX IN SAFETY RECEIVING FROM THE WIFE OF THIS IMMACULATE MAN A DIRECTION TO MISTER GARLAND'S HE TOOK THE BOX UPON HIS SHOULDER AND REPAIRED THITHER DIRECTLY TO BE SURE
WITH EVERYTHING IN IT AS BRIGHT AND GLOWING AND AS PRECISELY ORDERED TOO AS BARBARA HERSELF
I'VE BEEN SUCH A TIME GONE HE'LL THINK I'M LOST MISTER ABEL INVOLUNTARILY URGED THE PONY FORWARD THE PONY IMPELLED BY SOME SECRET SYMPATHY OR SOME NEW CAPRICE BURST INTO A GREAT PACE AND NEITHER SLACKENED IT
THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID KIT
THE PONY YIELDED TO MISTER ABEL'S MILDNESS AND TROTTED GENTLY OFF ALL THIS TIME MISTER CHUCKSTER HAD BEEN STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THE SMALL SERVANT HAD BEEN AFRAID TO APPROACH SHE HAD NOTHING FOR IT NOW THEREFORE BUT TO RUN AFTER THE CHAISE
PRAY DON'T TAKE TO GOING THERE REGULARLY FOR IF I WAS TO SEE YOUR GOOD HUMOURED FACE THAT HAS ALWAYS MADE HOME CHEERFUL TURNED INTO A GRIEVOUS ONE AND THE BABY TRAINED TO LOOK GRIEVOUS TOO AND TO CALL ITSELF A YOUNG SINNER BLESS ITS HEART AND A CHILD OF THE DEVIL
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME SAID MISTER ABEL
IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP AND CAN TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE PLACE THEY'VE GONE TO WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID KIT
IF HE HAD EVER BEEN ONE OF THAT MOURNFUL CONGREGATION LEST ANYBODY SHOULD FEEL A CURIOSITY TO KNOW HOW KIT WAS CLAD IT MAY BE BRIEFLY REMARKED THAT HE WORE NO LIVERY BUT WAS DRESSED IN A COAT OF PEPPER AND SALT WITH WAISTCOAT OF CANARY COLOUR
IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN
AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE CONSEQUENTLY THE PONY BEING DETERRED BY NO CONSIDERATIONS OF DUTY OR OBEDIENCE AND NOT HAVING BEFORE HIM THE SLIGHTEST FEAR OF THE HUMAN EYE HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF
KIT INWARDLY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NEVER TEMPT A CARRIER ANY MORE SAVE WITH AN EMPTY BOX AND HAVING FORMED THIS CHRISTIAN DETERMINATION HE TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO THE SECOND QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU MUST KEEP UP YOUR SPIRITS MOTHER AND NOT BE LONESOME BECAUSE I'M NOT AT HOME
SHE DID I AM QUITE BEWILDERED BY ALL THIS I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR THINK REPLIED MISTER ABEL YOU'LL SAY THAT PRESENTLY RETORTED DICK MARCHIONESS TAKE A SEAT ON THE BED WILL YOU
SHE EASILY PROCURED A DIRECTION AS CARRIER PIGEONS ON BEING FIRST LET LOOSE IN A STRANGE PLACE BEAT THE AIR AT RANDOM FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SPOT FOR WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNED
WHENEVER SHE'S WANTED AND AS TO ME YOU'RE PRETTY SURE TO FIND ME AT HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO THERE ARE MORE REASONS THAN ONE FOR THAT MARCHIONESS A LIGHT IF YOU LOSE ANOTHER MINUTE IN LOOKING AT ME SIR I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH
BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE FIRE STOOD TWO GENTLEMEN ONE OF WHOM SHE RIGHTLY JUDGED TO BE THE NOTARY AND THE OTHER WHO WAS BUTTONING HIS GREAT COAT AND WAS EVIDENTLY ABOUT TO DEPART IMMEDIATELY MISTER ABEL GARLAND
AT LAST IT WAS CONVEYED TO THE CARRIER'S AT WHOSE HOUSE AT FINCHLEY KIT WAS TO FIND IT NEXT DAY AND THE BOX BEING GONE THERE REMAINED BUT TWO QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION FIRSTLY WHETHER THE CARRIER WOULD LOSE
COMMON IN STORY BOOKS TO YOUTHS OF LOW DEGREE ON THEIR FIRST VISIT TO STRANGE HOUSES THE DOOR WAS GENTLY OPENED AND A LITTLE SERVANT GIRL VERY TIDY MODEST AND DEMURE BUT VERY PRETTY TOO APPEARED I SUPPOSE YOU'RE CHRISTOPHER SIR
WITH THIS PURPOSE SHE SLIPPED OUT AGAIN AND CROSSING THE ROAD SAT DOWN UPON A DOOR STEP JUST OPPOSITE SHE HAD HARDLY TAKEN THIS POSITION WHEN THERE CAME DANCING UP THE STREET WITH HIS LEGS ALL WRONG AND HIS HEAD EVERYWHERE BY TURNS A PONY
CAME UP THE STREET IN PERFECT UNANIMITY UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
I WONDER IF SCALPING HURTS AS MUCH AS THEY SAY I'LL WAVE THE FLAG AGAIN SAID ANTHEA IF THEY STAND BACK WE'LL RUN FOR IT SHE WAVED THE TOWEL AND THE CHIEF COMMANDED HIS FOLLOWERS TO STAND BACK
AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
SO YOU'VE FORGOTTEN SAID THE PSAMMEAD BEGINNING TO BURROW NEVER MIND YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH AND I WISH YOU JOY OF IT A NICE THING YOU'VE LET YOURSELVES IN FOR WE ALWAYS DO SOMEHOW SAID JANE SADLY
A YOUNG MAN WHO WORE THE SAME LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE WHICH JUST BEFORE THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN GROWING UPON THE BABY'S LIP THIS THEN WAS THE LAMB GROWN UP THEIR OWN LAMB IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
IF WE DRESSED UP AS LIKE INDIANS AS WE CAN AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS OR EVEN WENT OUT THEY MIGHT THINK WE WERE THE POWERFUL LEADERS OF A LARGE NEIGHBOURING TRIBE AND AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO US YOU KNOW FOR FEAR OF AWFUL VENGEANCE BUT ELIZA
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HURT SOMEBODY ROBERT CAUGHT UP THE STONE IN A FURY I SHOULD
IT WAS HEARTLESS WORK NEXT SHE BROKE OPEN THE MISSIONARY BOX WITH THE POKER JANE TOLD HER THAT IT WAS WRONG OF COURSE BUT ANTHEA SHUT HER LIPS VERY TIGHT AND THEN SAID DON'T BE SILLY IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
RIGHT OVER THE EDGE OF THE SAND PIT THEY WENT AMONG THE YELLOW AND PALE PURPLE FLOWERS AND DRIED GRASSES PAST THE LITTLE SAND MARTINS LITTLE FRONT DOORS SKIPPING CLINGING BOUNDING STUMBLING SPRAWLING AND FINALLY ROLLING
AND NOW THE ODD THING WAS THAT NO ONE COULD REMEMBER ANYONE'S HAVING WISHED FOR ANYTHING THAT MORNING THE WISH ABOUT THE RED INDIANS HAD NOT STUCK IN ANYONE'S HEAD IT WAS A MOST ANXIOUS MORNING EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT HAD BEEN WISHED FOR
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
THERE WAS A CONFUSED NOISE BELOW AND SOME GROANS OH DEAR
AND NO ONE COULD AND EVERYONE KEPT EXPECTING SOMETHING AWFUL TO HAPPEN EVERY MINUTE IT WAS MOST AGITATING THEY KNEW FROM WHAT THE PSAMMEAD HAD SAID THAT THEY MUST HAVE WISHED FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN USUALLY UNDESIRABLE
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING WE'VE WISHED FOR THAT HASN'T GOT US INTO A ROW AND THERE HASN'T BEEN THE LEAST LITTLE SCRAP OF A ROW ABOUT THIS NOBODY'S RAGING DOWNSTAIRS WE'RE SAFE AND SOUND
AND ALL THE PROVISIONS EATEN AND NOW
LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND PUTTING ONE EYE TO THE LEAD HOLE OF COURSE THE HOLES GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GATE HOUSE THAT'S FOR WHEN THE ENEMY HAS GOT PAST THE DOOR AND THE PORTCULLIS AND ALMOST ALL IS LOST HERE HAND ME THE POT
IT IS BETTER NOT TO GO FLAT OF COURSE BUT YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT ANTHEA DID NOT GIVE WAY TILL HER AIM WAS ACCOMPLISHED SHE HAD GOT THE DEAR LAMB OUT OF DANGER SHE FELT CERTAIN THE RED INDIANS WOULD BE ROUND THE WHITE HOUSE OR NOWHERE
A MAN WHO WAS WITH THE TRUMPETER SHOUTED WHAT HO WITHIN THERE AND
BUT SHE FOLLOWED HER SISTER MEEKLY INTO THEIR MOTHER'S BEDROOM ANTHEA LIFTED DOWN THE HEAVY WATER JUG
LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD YOU KIDS MUST LEARN NOT TO MAKE YOURSELVES A NUISANCE RUN ALONG HOME NOW AND PERHAPS IF YOU'RE GOOD I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A PENNY TO MORROW LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IN THE BEST MAN TO MAN TONE AT HIS COMMAND
NO ONE EVER CAN AS A MATTER OF FACT IN THAT PART OF KENT THE CHILDREN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF BUT IT ENDED IN A MOAN OF TERROR FOR BRIGHT KNIVES WERE BEING BRANDISHED ALL ABOUT THEM NEXT MOMENT EACH CHILD WAS SEIZED BY AN INDIAN
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO IF WE GET THE NEW JUG SAID ANTHEA BUT WE'LL PAY FOR YOU TO GO IF YOU'LL TAKE THE LAMB AND I SAY MARTHA LOOK HERE I'LL GIVE YOU MY LIBERTY BOX IF YOU'LL GO
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
THEY'LL TAKE OUR REAL ONES IN A MINUTE YOU SEE IF THEY DON'T SAID ROBERT TRYING TO RUB SOME OF THE RED OCHRE OFF HIS FACE AND HANDS ON TO HIS HAIR CHEATED OF OUR JUST AND FIERY REVENGE ARE WE THE CHANT WENT ON
YELLOW EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME UP WITH THEM JUST AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY HAD SEEN THE PSAMMEAD THAT MORNING BREATHLESS AND BEATEN THE WRETCHED CHILDREN NOW AWAITED THEIR FATE
JANE'LL FINISH LAYING THE CLOTH AND I'LL WASH THE LAMB AND GET HIM READY AS SHE WASHED THE UNWILLING LAMB AND HURRIED HIM INTO HIS BEST CLOTHES ANTHEA PEEPED OUT OF THE WINDOW FROM TIME TO TIME SO FAR ALL WAS WELL SHE COULD SEE NO RED INDIANS
BUT GOLDEN EAGLE ONLY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HER THY CUSTOMS ARE OTHER THAN OURS O BLACK PANTHER HE SAID BRING UP THY TRIBE THAT WE MAY HOLD POW WOW IN STATE BEFORE THEM AS BECOMES GREAT CHIEFS
THE LAMB WAS PULLING UP THE MOSS BY FAT HANDFULS AND CYRIL WAS GLOOMILY CONTEMPLATING THE RUINS OF HIS WATCH HE DOES GROW SAID ANTHEA DOESN'T OO PRECIOUS ME GROW
AND LEFT HIM WITH HIS LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND HIS FLANNEL SUIT TO MEET ALONE THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW CAME UP THE FRONT GARDEN WHEELING A BICYCLE THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE TO HER
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WISHES OF THE CHILDREN THEREFORE MARTHA MERELY SAW THE USUAL PARTY WITH THE BABY LAMB ABOUT WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DESPERATELY ANXIOUS ALL THE AFTERNOON TROTTING BESIDE ANTHEA ON FAT BABY LEGS WHILE THE CHILDREN OF COURSE STILL SAW THE GROWN UP LAMB
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T LAST THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT GETTING UP TO SOME DOGGERY A PERSON CAN'T TAKE A BREATH OF AIR ON THE FRONT DOORSTEP BUT YOU MUST BE EMPTYING THE WASH HAND JUG ON TO THEIR HEADS OFF YOU GO TO BED THE LOT OF YOU
YOU CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU ARE POURING WATER ON A BESIEGING FOE AND YOUR CASTLE SUDDENLY CHANGES INTO YOUR HOUSE
AT ANY RATE THEY WENT ALONG THE HEDGE DIVIDING THE WILDERNESS FROM THE GARDEN WAS A ROW OF DARK HEADS ALL HIGHLY FEATHERED IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE WHISPERED ANTHEA
AND CAUGHT THE LAMB I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY HILARY BY THE ARM THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND IN AN INSTANT THE FOUR DIRTY CHILDREN WERE VISIBLE BEYOND DISGUISE DON'T LET HIM SAID ANTHEA TO THE LADY AND SHE SPOKE WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS HE'S NOT FIT TO GO WITH ANYONE
WITH FOUR WILD WAR WHOOPS OR AS NEAR THEM AS ENGLISH CHILDREN COULD BE EXPECTED TO GO WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS PRACTICE THEY RUSHED THROUGH THE GATE AND STRUCK FOUR WARLIKE ATTITUDES IN FACE OF THE LINE OF RED INDIANS
THE NEAT GREY FLANNEL SUITED GROWN UP YOUNG MAN WITH THE GREEN TIE AND THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE FORTUNATELY HE WAS SLIGHTLY BUILT AND NOT TALL STRUGGLING IN THE STURDY ARMS OF MARTHA WHO BORE HIM AWAY HELPLESS IMPLORING HIM AS SHE WENT TO BE A GOOD BOY NOW
YOU CAN'T BE REALLY SCALPED OR BURNED TO DEATH WITHOUT NOTICING IT AND YOU'D BE SURE TO NOTICE IT NEXT DAY EVEN IF IT ESCAPED YOUR ATTENTION AT THE TIME SAID CYRIL I THINK ANTHEA'S RIGHT BUT WE SHALL WANT A MOST AWFUL LOT OF FEATHERS I'LL GO DOWN TO THE HEN HOUSE SAID ROBERT
JANE PLEADED I DON'T BELIEVE THE SUN'S GOING TO SET TO NIGHT AT ALL
ALL GONE AND THERE WAS THE GARDEN WITH ITS TANGLE OF DAHLIAS AND MARIGOLDS AND ASTERS AND LATE ROSES AND THE SPIKY IRON RAILINGS AND THE QUIET WHITE ROAD EVERYONE
AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
SO THAT THEY WERE THE CENTRE OF A CROWD OF DARK CRUEL FACES IT'S NO GO WHISPERED ROBERT I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE WE MUST MAKE A BOLT FOR THE PSAMMEAD IT MIGHT HELP US IF IT DOESN'T WELL
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GET IT TO DAY IN CASE MOTHER COMES HOME TO MORROW YOU KNOW SHE SAID SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BUT YOU'RE ALL GOING INTO TOWN YOURSELVES SAID MARTHA
AND ELECTRIFIED HER RELATIVES AT DINNER BY TELLING THEM OF HER ESCAPE FROM A FAMILY OF DANGEROUS LUNATICS THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES WERE SIMPLY THOSE OF A MANIAC I CAN'T THINK HOW SHE CAME TO BE AT LARGE SHE SAID WHEN HER BICYCLE HAD WHIZZED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD
SAID JANE OH BOTHER NUTS SAID ROBERT BUT DINNER'S DIFFERENT
TURNING WITH A BITTER SMILE TO THE OTHER RED INDIANS BUILD WE THE FIRE SHOUTED HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT ONCE A DOZEN READY VOLUNTEERS STARTED TO LOOK FOR FUEL
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF BLACK CALICO THAT HAD BEEN GOT TO COVER SCHOOL BOOKS WITH THEY CUT STRIPS OF THIS INTO A SORT OF FINE FRINGE AND FASTENED IT ROUND THEIR HEADS WITH THE AMBER COLOURED RIBBONS OFF THE GIRLS SUNDAY DRESSES
WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN YOU MIGHT LET BOBS AND ME COME WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GIRLS THIS WAS REALLY RATHER NOBLE OF CYRIL
THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
THE NEXT MOMENT ALL THE OTHERS WERE FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE AND OPENING AND SHUTTING THEIR MOUTHS AN INCH OR SO FROM THE BARE LOOKING TABLE ROBERT CAPTURED A
AH FOR THE BOUNDLESS FORESTS OF MY NATIVE LAND WHERE THE GREAT TREES FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES GROW BUT TO FURNISH FIREWOOD WHEREWITHAL TO BURN OUR FOES AH WOULD WE WERE BUT IN OUR NATIVE FOREST ONCE MORE
ASKED THE LADY NOT UNNATURALLY WHILE DEVEREUX AS I MUST TERM THE GROWN UP LAMB TRIED VAINLY TO PUSH ANTHEA AWAY THE OTHERS BACKED HER UP AND SHE STOOD SOLID AS A ROCK YOU JUST LET HIM GO WITH YOU SAID ANTHEA YOU'LL SOON SEE WHAT I MEAN
AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LAMB DEVEREUX I MEAN HAD TRIED TO STOP JANE'S ELOQUENCE BUT ROBERT AND CYRIL HELD HIM ONE BY EACH LEG AND NO PROPER EXPLANATION WAS POSSIBLE THE LADY RODE HASTILY AWAY
TAKE HIM REPEATED CYRIL YES DO IT'S ALL MY FAULT I DON'T DENY THAT BUT YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THAT YOUNG MAN ANYWHERE THE LAMB ALWAYS WAS SPOILT BUT NOW HE'S GROWN UP HE'S A DEMON SIMPLY
NO ONE COULD MOVE SUDDENLY THE FEATHERED HEAD WAS CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWN AND THE SPELL WAS BROKEN I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT ANTHEA'S FIRST WORDS WERE VERY LIKE A GIRL THERE NOW SHE SAID I TOLD YOU SO
ROBERT HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING QUIETLY BUT PERSISTENTLY THE MISERABLE FOUR TOOK IT IN TURNS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE LAMB OR SAINT MAUR TO SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY IN THE WOODS THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH OF THE DAY LEFT BY THE TIME HE HAD MENDED THE EIGHTEENTH PUNCTURE
OH I SAY CYRIL WAS BEGINNING BUT ANTHEA STOPPED HIM
AND TO HOLD A HURRIED COUNCIL PAX SAID CYRIL HANDSOMELY WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR MOTHER'S BEDROOM PANTHER I'M SORRY IF I WAS A BRUTE ALL RIGHT SAID ANTHEA BUT YOU SEE NOW
CYRIL SAID HE WAS THE GREAT CHIEF SQUIRREL OF THE MONING CONGO TRIBE AND SEEING THAT JANE WAS SUCKING HER THUMB AND COULD EVIDENTLY THINK OF NO NAME FOR HERSELF HE ADDED THIS GREAT WARRIOR IS WILD CAT
AND SMOKE PIPES OF PEACE IN YOUR WAMPUMS WITH YOUR SQUAWS AND YOUR MEDICINE MEN AND DRESS YOURSELVES IN THE GAYEST WIGWAMS AND EAT HAPPILY OF THE JUICY FRESH CAUGHT MOCCASINS YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG MURMURED CYRIL ANGRILY
THERE WAS A CRACK THE INNOCENT LAMB HAD BROKEN THE GLASS OF FATHER'S SECOND BEST WATERBURY WATCH WHICH CYRIL HAD BORROWED WITHOUT LEAVE GROW UP SOME DAY SAID CYRIL BITTERLY PLUMPING THE LAMB DOWN ON THE GRASS I DARESAY HE WILL WHEN NOBODY WANTS HIM TO
I SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF STONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE UP JUST TO DROP ON THEIR HEADS
I DO WANT THE JUG GOT SAID ANTHEA SOFTLY YOU WILL GO WON'T YOU WELL JUST FOR THIS ONCE I DON'T MIND BUT MIND YOU DON'T GET INTO NONE OF YOUR OUTRAGEOUS MISCHIEF WHILE I'M GONE THAT'S ALL
BIG FRONT BEDROOM OF THEIR OWN HOUSE
THEY LOOKED AT ROBERT WITH SURPRISED RESPECT ANTHEA SAID YOU REALLY ARE BRAVE ROBERT ROT CYRIL'S PALLOR TURNED TO REDNESS NOW ALL IN A MINUTE
THEN THEY STUCK TURKEYS FEATHERS IN THE RIBBONS THE CALICO LOOKED VERY LIKE LONG BLACK HAIR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STRIPS BEGAN TO CURL UP A BIT BUT OUR FACES SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE NOT AT ALL THE RIGHT COLOUR
EARNEST RECONNOITRING CONVINCED THEM ALL THAT NO INDIANS WERE IN THE POULTRY YARD ROBERT WENT IN FIVE MINUTES HE CAME BACK PALE BUT WITH MANY FEATHERS LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS JOLLY SERIOUS
AND THE FACE WAS PAINTED IN COLOURED PATCHES IT HAD LONG BLACK HAIR AND IN THE HAIR WERE FEATHERS EVERY CHILD'S MOUTH IN THE ROOM OPENED AND STAYED OPEN THE TREACLE PUDDING WAS GROWING WHITE AND COLD ON THEIR PLATES
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND THE LITTLE ROOM WAS ALMOST QUITE DARK WE'VE HELD IT CRIED ROBERT WE WON'T SURRENDER THE SUN MUST SET IN A MINUTE HERE THEY'RE ALL JAWING UNDERNEATH AGAIN PITY THERE'S NO TIME TO GET MORE STONES HERE POUR THAT WATER DOWN ON THEM
NEVER MIND WHAT NAMES HE WAS CHRISTENED BY AND MARTHA RUSHED AT HIM AND CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING COME TO HIS OWN MARTHA THEN A PRECIOUS POPPET THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE NAMES SHALL NOW BE BURIED IN OBLIVION STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY
SUDDENLY LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE GOLDEN GRAVEL SHONE ALL ROUND THE FOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF THE DUSKY FIGURES FOR EVERY SINGLE INDIAN HAD VANISHED ON THE INSTANT AT THEIR LEADER'S WORD
HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
JANE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL HOW A PERSON COULD BE SO BRAVE AND LIKE A GENERAL AND THEN SUDDENLY GIVE WAY AND GO FLAT LIKE AN AIR BALLOON WHEN YOU PRICK IT
OH IT AIN'T THAT MISS MARTHA GIGGLED MORE THAN EVER I'M A GOIN TO BE MARRIED IT'S BEALE THE GAMEKEEPER HE'S BEEN A PROPOSIN TO ME OFF AND ON EVER SINCE YOU COME HOME FROM THE CLERGYMAN'S WHERE YOU GOT LOCKED UP ON THE CHURCH TOWER
WHO OF COURSE AFTER SUNSET WOULD BE A BABY AGAIN THE MAN TO MAN TONE SUCCEEDED I SHALL JUST RUN OVER TO MAIDSTONE ON MY BIKE SAID THE NEW LAMB AIRILY FINGERING THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE I CAN LUNCH AT THE CROWN AND PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A PULL ON THE RIVER
FEW INTREPID SURVIVORS THAT'S US
BUT THERE ARE OTHER TORMENTS THAN THE SCALPING KNIFE AND THE FLAMES YET IS THE SLOW FIRE THE CORRECT THING O STRANGE UNNATURAL COUNTRY WHEREIN A MAN MAY FIND NO WOOD TO BURN HIS ENEMY
THEY USED TO POUR BOILING LEAD DOWN ON BESIEGERS WHEN THEY GOT TOO CLOSE SAID ANTHEA FATHER SHOWED ME THE HOLES ON PURPOSE FOR POURING IT DOWN THROUGH AT BODIAM CASTLE AND THERE ARE HOLES LIKE IT
WERE MAKING THE CHILDREN WISE BEYOND THEIR YEARS DEAR HILARY SAID ANTHEA
HE'S GOING EARLIER THAN HE THOUGHT SAID ANTHEA EAGERLY YOU'D BETTER HURRY AND GET DRESSED DO PUT ON THAT LOVELY PURPLE FROCK MARTHA AND THE HAT WITH THE PINK CORNFLOWERS AND THE YELLOW LACE COLLAR
I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE GROWN UP SOME DAY ANTHEA WAS SAYING DREAMILY LOOKING UP AT THE BLUE OF THE SKY THAT SHOWED BETWEEN THE LONG STRAIGHT CHESTNUT LEAVES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAMB
CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
A SIEGE AND BED THE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE GLOOMY BANQUETING HALL AT THE END OF ONE OF THE LONG BARE WOODEN TABLES THERE WAS NOW NO HOPE
THE GROWN UP LAMB OR HILARY AS I SUPPOSE ONE MUST NOW CALL HIM FIXED HIS PUMP AND BLEW UP THE TYRE THE PUNCTURED STATE OF IT WAS SOON EVIDENT I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COTTAGE SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE ONE COULD GET A PAIL OF WATER SAID THE LAMB
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHICH OF YOU IS THE BRAVEST I THINK CYRIL WAS A PERFECT SILLY TO WISH FOR A CASTLE
WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
A TRUMPETER CAME FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE MOAT WHICH NOW SEEMED VERY MUCH NARROWER THAN AT FIRST
HAD BEEN GOT OFF ANTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH HE'S SAFE SHE SAID AND TO JANE'S HORROR
EATEN WITH WATER FROM THE DEEP WELL IN THE COURTYARD DRUNK OUT OF HORNS
I DON'T KNOW SAID CYRIL AFTER A PAUSE UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE WE HAD THEM
WITH THE MOST FAR SEEING PROMPTITUDE
I THINK I AM NOW SAID ANTHEA SLOWLY BUT I WOULDN'T WISH FOR IT AGAIN I THINK SQUIRREL DEAR OH IT WAS SIMPLY SPLENDID SAID JANE UNEXPECTEDLY I WASN'T FRIGHTENED A BIT
THE FOUR CHILDREN EACH HELD BETWEEN TWO STRONG LITTLE INDIANS CAST DESPAIRING GLANCES ROUND THEM OH IF THEY COULD ONLY SEE THE PSAMMEAD DO YOU MEAN TO SCALP US FIRST AND THEN ROAST US ASKED ANTHEA DESPERATELY
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT SAID ANTHEA THE SAMMYADD SAID WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING THAT MEANS THEY'LL COME HERE AND SUPPOSE THEY SCALPED THE LAMB PERHAPS THE SCALPING WOULD COME RIGHT AGAIN AT SUNSET SAID JANE
BUT AS FOR RED INDIANS WHY YOU KNOW JOLLY WELL THE WISHES ALWAYS COME THAT VERY MINUTE IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE RED INDIANS THEY'D BE HERE NOW I EXPECT THEY ARE SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE LURKING AMID THE UNDERGROWTH FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SINCE PEOPLE LEFT OFF EATING REALLY WHOLESOME THINGS HOWEVER HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SAID CYRIL POLITELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THE PUDDING WAS FORTUNATELY
AN IMAGINATION OR VOCABULARY GAVE OUT HERE BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE LONGEST SPEECH THE LAMB HAD EVER MADE AND IT CHARMED EVERYONE EVEN CYRIL WHO TUMBLED THE LAMB OVER AND ROLLED HIM IN THE MOSS TO THE MUSIC OF DELIGHTED SQUEALS
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
BLANK MISERY FELL LIKE A PALL ON THE FOUR OTHERS THE LAMB
EACH CLOSED ITS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO SCREAM THEY WAITED FOR THE SHARP AGONY OF THE KNIFE IT DID NOT COME NEXT MOMENT THEY WERE RELEASED AND FELL IN A TREMBLING HEAP THEIR HEADS DID NOT HURT AT ALL
DREW A DEEP BREATH AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID ROBERT I TOLD YOU SO AND I SAY WE DIDN'T SURRENDER DID WE
YOU KNOW FATHER DIDN'T WISH YOU TO GO TO LONDON HE WOULDN'T LIKE US TO BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF US OH DECEITFUL BEAST THAT I AM SHE ADDED TO HERSELF LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IF YOU'RE OUR ELDER BROTHER
MY COUSIN SHE GIVE ME THE JUG FOR LUCK SHE SAID IT WAS AN ODD ONE WHAT THE BASIN OF HAD GOT SMASHED OH MARTHA
AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
IT WASN'T SAID JANE BRIEFLY WHY IF IT WAS INDIANS CYRIL WENT ON SALT PLEASE AND MUSTARD I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS MUSH GO DOWN IF IT WAS INDIANS THEY'D HAVE BEEN INFESTING THE PLACE LONG BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW THEY WOULD
THE GARRISON WAS WELL PROVISIONED TILL SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT UP SOME IRON POTS OF COLD WATER TO POUR ON THE BESIEGERS INSTEAD OF HOT LEAD WITH WHICH THE CASTLE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROVIDED
THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH IN THE MISSIONARY BOX
ANTHEA DETACHED A PIN FROM HER WAISTBAND A PIN WHOSE WITHDRAWAL LEFT A GAPING CHASM BETWEEN SKIRT AND BODICE AND HANDED IT FURTIVELY TO ROBERT WITH A GRIMACE OF THE DARKEST AND DEEPEST MEANING ROBERT SLIPPED AWAY TO THE ROAD
A TWO YEAR OLD BABY IN A LINEN SMOCK AND WHITE OPEN WORK SOCKS OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T YOU BOYS MIGHT WISH AS WELL THEY ALL WISHED HARD FOR THE SIGHT WAS ENOUGH TO DISMAY THE MOST HEARTLESS
CYRIL HAD PERSUADED THE OTHERS TO AGREE TO HIS PLAN AND NOT TO WISH FOR ANYTHING MORE TILL THEY REALLY DID WISH IT MEANTIME IT SEEMED GOOD TO GO TO THE WOODS FOR NUTS AND ON THE MOSSY GRASS UNDER A SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THE FIVE WERE SITTING
HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUDDENLY SEE A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BABY SPINNING ALONG DOWNHILL BESIDE YOU WITH ITS FEET UP ON A BICYCLE IT HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE LADY HAD TURNED RATHER PALE WHO ARE THESE VERY DIRTY CHILDREN SHE ASKED THE GROWN UP LAMB
TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
AS CYRIL SAID ARMED HEAVILY FOR THESE SWORDS AND LANCES AND CROSSBOWS WERE FAR TOO WEIGHTY EVEN FOR CYRIL'S MANLY STRENGTH AND AS FOR THE LONGBOWS NONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD EVEN BEGIN TO BEND THEM THE DAGGERS WERE BETTER
SO A HEAP OF STONES GREW APACE UP IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GATE AND ANOTHER HEAP A SHINY SPIKY DANGEROUS LOOKING HEAP OF DAGGERS AND KNIVES
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
I BELIEVE IT'S THE FINE DAY THEN WHY DID THE SAMMYADD SAY WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING ASKED ANTHEA SHE WAS FEELING VERY CROSS SHE KNEW SHE HAD ACTED WITH NOBILITY AND DISCRETION
BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
ONE OF WHOSE NAMES WAS DEVEREUX SAYING ME LOVE PANTY WANTS TO COME TO OWN PANTY OH LET'S GET HOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE SHE SAID YOU SHALL SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN THE MORNING IF YOU CAN SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
WAS GONE FOR EVER FOR EVER SAID CYRIL BECAUSE AS SOON AS EVER THE LAMB'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE BULLIED WE MUST JOLLY WELL BEGIN TO BULLY HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE SO THAT HE MAYN'T GROW UP LIKE THAT YOU SHAN'T BULLY HIM SAID ANTHEA STOUTLY
THEY KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT FOR THEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT TABLE SUDDENLY CYRIL FELT IN HIS POCKET
YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
I SELDOM PLAY
AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE HORROR AND ANNOYANCE WAS SEEN ON HIS FACE BUT MARTHA WAS STRONGER THAN HE SHE LIFTED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE HOUSE NONE OF THE CHILDREN WILL EVER FORGET THAT PICTURE
AND JANE TOOK A VERY LITTLE COURAGE AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT SUNSET COULDN'T BE FAR OFF NOW THE MOAT IS DREADFULLY THIN SAID ANTHEA BUT THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE CASTLE EVEN IF THEY DO SWIM OVER
I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH A WISH DAY WITHOUT A ROW SAID CYRIL IT WAS MUCH TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE COME ON BOBS MY MILITARY HERO IF WE LICK INTO BED SHARP SHE WON'T BE SO FRUMIOUS AND PERHAPS SHE'LL BONG US UP SOME SUPPER
SO THE MACHINE WAS WHEELED THE SUN WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SETTING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE FOUR ELDER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LINGER IN THE LANE TILL THE COMPLETE SUNSETTING TURNED THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAMES I WILL NOT FURTHER WEARY YOU BY REPEATING
INTO THE MOAT WATER IN ANOTHER MOMENT ROBERT WAS OUTSIDE THE LITTLE ROOM
AS ANTHEA WAS CROSSING THE COURTYARD FOR MORE STONES A SUDDEN AND VALUABLE IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WENT TO MARTHA AND SAID
THE PSAMMEAD MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND IT HAD GIVEN THE INDIAN CHIEF HIS WISH MARTHA BROUGHT HOME A JUG WITH A PATTERN OF STORKS AND LONG GRASSES ON IT ALSO SHE BROUGHT BACK ALL ANTHEA'S MONEY
WAS GETTING RATHER DARK IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GREAT
PUSSY FEROX WE CALL IT IN THIS LAND LEADER OF THE VAST PHITEEZI TRIBE AND THOU VALOROUS REDSKIN GOLDEN EAGLE INQUIRED SUDDENLY OF ROBERT WHO TAKEN UNAWARES COULD ONLY REPLY THAT HE WAS BOBS LEADER OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE
THESE ALSO PUSSY FEROX OF THE PHITEEZI AND BOBS OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE THESE ALSO HAVE LIED TO US IF NOT WITH THEIR TONGUE YET BY THEIR SILENCE
THIS UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL PLEASED THEM VERY MUCH HASTILY TELLING HER NOT TO BE A GOOSE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY A GAME THE FOUR BLANKETED FEATHERED REALLY AND TRULY REDSKINS WENT BOLDLY OUT TO MEET THE FOE I SAY BOLDLY
THE MOAT AND THE TENTS
YOU SEE HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE INDIANS THEY WOULD BE ENTIRELY HIS OWN FAULT SO HE DID NOT WISH TO BELIEVE IN THEM AND TRYING NOT TO BELIEVE THINGS WHEN IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST SURE THEY ARE TRUE IS AS BAD FOR THE TEMPER AS ANYTHING I KNOW
YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK SO HOPEFULLY AS USUAL NOT IT SAID ANTHEA THE THINGS THAT GROW OUT OF THE WISHES DON'T GO LOOK AT THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS PUSSY
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT ANSWER THE YOUNG LADY INTENDED TO GIVE TO THIS GALLANT OFFER FOR DIRECTLY ANTHEA HEARD IT MADE SHE RUSHED OUT KNOCKING AGAINST THE PIG PAIL
DON'T YOU GO FOR TO THINK I DON'T SEE THROUGH YOU THIS WAS SO TRUE THAT ANTHEA LONGED TO DENY IT AT ONCE MARTHA HAD NO BUSINESS TO KNOW SO MUCH BUT SHE HELD HER TONGUE MARTHA SET DOWN THE BREAD WITH A BANG THAT MADE IT JUMP OFF ITS TRENCHER
AND THEY'RE GOING ABOUT SCALPING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY LIKE AS NOT PERHAPS THEY'RE ONLY IN NORTHUMBERLAND AND DURHAM SAID JANE SOOTHINGLY IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD REALLY HURT PEOPLE MUCH TO BE SCALPED SO FAR AWAY AS THAT
JUST AS HE WAS PUTTING AWAY THE RESERVE BISCUITS IN A SORT OF LITTLE STONE CUPBOARD WITHOUT A DOOR A SUDDEN SOUND MADE HIM DROP THREE IT WAS THE LOUD FIERCE CRY OF A TRUMPET YOU SEE
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
SO THAT THEY KEPT RED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND STARTED TO TELL THE BOYS BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT COOK RANG THE DINNER BELL AND NOTHING COULD BE SAID TILL THEY HAD ALL BEEN HELPED TO MINCED BEEF THEN COOK LEFT THE ROOM AND ANTHEA TOLD HER TALE
PAINFUL SCENE IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THEY ALL HAD ENOUGH MUTTON AND THAT WHEN MARTHA CAME TO CHANGE THE PLATES SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS IN ALL HER BORN DAYS
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS UP TO SOME MISCHIEF SAID MARTHA DUMPING DOWN A SALT CELLAR WITH A BANG DON'T BE CROSS MARTHA DEAR SAID ANTHEA I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A NEW ONE
A RELIC OF FOOLISH AND FAR OFF CHILDHOOD THIS WAS AWFUL HE WAS THEIR ELDER BROTHER NOW WAS HE WELL OF COURSE HE WAS IF HE WAS GROWN UP SINCE THEY WEREN'T THUS
GET THE COLOURED BLANKETS OFF OUR BEDS AND LOOK SLIPPY CAN'T YOU IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LIKE AN INDIAN YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELVES WITH BLANKETS AND FEATHERS AND COLOURED SCARVES
I DO THINK YOU'RE MOST BEASTLY UNKIND INDIANS ALMOST ALWAYS DO LURK REALLY THOUGH DON'T THEY PUT IN JANE ANXIOUS FOR PEACE NO THEY DON'T SAID CYRIL TARTLY AND I'M NOT UNKIND I'M ONLY TRUTHFUL
SAID CYRIL AFTER THE LAMB HAD TAKEN HIS WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE HE WASN'T NOTICING AND WITH COOS AND CLUCKS OF NAUGHTY RAPTURE HAD OPENED THE CASE AND USED THE WHOLE THING AS A GARDEN SPADE
OH DEAR SAID JANE DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER SURRENDER NEVER SAID ROBERT WE'LL HAVE A PARLEY IF YOU LIKE BUT WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER
WELL THEN SAID ROBERT LET'S WAKE HIM UP AND SEE WHAT HE'LL DO PERHAPS HE'LL TAKE US TO MAIDSTONE AND STAND SAM HE OUGHT TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF THOSE EXTRA SPECIAL BAGS WE MUST HAVE DINNER ANYWAY THEY DREW LOTS WITH LITTLE BITS OF BRACKEN
FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
WE'LL BRING THEM UP RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ANTHEA WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND TOMAHAWKS AND SCALPING KNIVES AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF IF YOU DON'T LOOK SHARP AND GO SHE SPOKE BRAVELY ENOUGH
AND THE COOK SAID JANE YOU FORGET THEY CAN'T NOTICE ANYTHING SAID ROBERT THEY WOULDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY EVEN IF THEY WERE SCALPED OR ROASTED AT A SLOW FIRE BUT WOULD THEY COME RIGHT AT SUNSET OF COURSE
I'D GIVE SOMETHING FOR A JOLLY GOOD BOILING KETTLE OF LEAD
ANYONE SHOULD FEEL FAINT IN STRESS OF BATTLE
TREACLE PUDDING HAD NOW DEFINITELY CEASED TO CHARM HASTILY WRAPPING THEIR PORTIONS IN A SPECTATOR OF THE WEEK BEFORE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST THEY HID THEM BEHIND THE CRINKLED PAPER STOVE ORNAMENT AND FLED UPSTAIRS TO RECONNOITRE
IN FACT IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT HE WAS TO TAKE THE FOUR CHILDREN WITH HIM THEY HAD PLANNED THIS IN THE HAPPY HOUR WHEN THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET THAT HUNDRED POUNDS IN TWO SHILLING PIECES OUT OF THE PSAMMEAD
GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL SAID SAINT MAUR AS WE WILL NOW CALL HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE GO HOME AT ONCE YOU'D MUCH BETTER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE NOW RECKLESS ANTHEA WENT ON HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS HE'S SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK HE IS
BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
YE HAVE LIED UNDER THE COVER OF THE TRUCE FLAG OF THE PALE FACE YE HAVE NO FOLLOWERS YOUR TRIBES ARE FAR AWAY FOLLOWING THE HUNTING TRAIL WHAT SHALL BE THEIR DOOM HE CONCLUDED
NO FURTHER TRACE OF INDIANS HOWEVER COULD BE DISCERNED FROM THE WINDOWS WELL SAID ROBERT WHAT ARE WE TO DO THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF SAID ANTHEA WHO WAS NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED TO BE THE HEROINE OF THE DAY IS
IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
WOULDN'T YOU SAID ROBERT YOU SEE
PERHAPS HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TEA THERE PERHAPS SUNSET WOULD COME UPON HIM AMID THE DAZZLING LUXURY OF CLUB LAND AND A HELPLESS CROSS SLEEPY BABY WOULD FIND ITSELF ALONE AMID UNSYMPATHETIC WAITERS AND WOULD WAIL MISERABLY FOR PANTY FROM THE DEPTHS OF A CLUB ARM CHAIR
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY AT BESIEGED CASTLES
THERE'S ONE OF THE TURKEYS IN THERE IT'S NOT VERY WELL I COULD CUT ITS FEATHERS WITHOUT IT MINDING MUCH IT'S VERY BAD DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT GET ME THE CUTTING OUT SCISSORS
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
THERE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD THAT MADE THE IDEA OF RED INDIANS SEEM FLAT AND UNBELIEVABLE THE BOYS ACTUALLY LAUGHED AND CALLED ANTHEA A LITTLE SILLY WHY SAID CYRIL
THE INDIANS HAD FORMED A RING ROUND THE CHILDREN AND NOW SAT ON THE GROUND GAZING AT THEIR CAPTIVES THERE WAS A THREATENING SILENCE THEN SLOWLY BY TWOS AND THREES THE INDIANS WHO HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR FIREWOOD CAME BACK AND THEY CAME BACK EMPTY HANDED
AND SAT DOWN FLAT ON THE CARPET OH PUSSY HOW AWFUL IT WAS INDIANS HE WISHED FOR CYRIL AT BREAKFAST DON'T YOU REMEMBER HE SAID I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND AND NOW THERE ARE
AND HIS FINGERS WERE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE ROBERT NEVER KNEW HOW THE MAN HAD MANAGED TO CLIMB UP OUT OF THE WATER BUT HE SAW THE CLINGING FINGERS AND HIT THEM AS HARD AS HE COULD WITH AN IRON BAR THAT HE CAUGHT UP FROM THE FLOOR THE MAN FELL
OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
PUT MINE IN MY POCKET PLEASE MY HANDS ARE SO DIRTY AND I'LL TELL THE OTHERS TO FETCH THEIRS THIS WAS INDEED A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR NOW WITH FOUR GENEROUS HANDFULS OF AIR WHICH TURNED TO BISCUIT AS MARTHA CRAMMED IT INTO THEIR POCKETS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND TAKING THE POT FROM ANTHEA POURED THE WATER OUT THROUGH THE ARROW SLIT AND AS HE BEGAN TO POUR THE NOISE OF THE BATTERING RAM AND THE TRAMPLING OF THE FOE AND THE SHOUTS OF
THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH COOK TOOK AWAY THE MINCY PLATES AND BROUGHT IN THE TREACLE PUDDING AS SOON AS SHE HAD RETIRED CYRIL BEGAN AGAIN OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE ADMITTED THAT IT WASN'T A GOOD THING TO GET MARTHA AND THE LAMB OUT OF THE LIGHT FOR THE AFTERNOON
THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
AND NOW SAID BLACK PANTHER OUR TRIBES IF WE JUST WHISTLE THEM UP WILL FAR OUTNUMBER YOUR PUNY FORCES SO RESISTANCE IS USELESS RETURN THEREFORE TO YOUR OWN LAND O BROTHER
BUT THE HEARTS OF ALL THE CHILDREN WERE BEATING FURIOUSLY AND THEIR BREATH CAME IN SHORTER AND SHORTER GASPS FOR THE LITTLE REAL RED INDIANS WERE CLOSING UP ROUND THEM COMING NEARER AND NEARER WITH ANGRY MURMURS
AND TO DAY I SAID THE WORD AN MADE HIM A HAPPY MAN
BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
AND THE TRAMP OF ARMED MEN UP QUICK CRIED ROBERT LET'S DROP THINGS ON THEM EVEN THE GIRLS WERE FEELING ALMOST BRAVE NOW THEY FOLLOWED ROBERT QUICKLY AND UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS
MUCH BETTER THAN TO WAIT FOR THEIR BLOOD FREEZING ATTACK WE MUST PRETEND LIKE MAD LIKE THAT GAME OF CARDS WHERE YOU PRETEND YOU'VE GOT ACES WHEN YOU HAVEN'T FLUFFING THEY CALL IT I THINK NOW THEN WHOOP
SO ANTHEA TILTED THE POT OVER THE NEAREST LEAD HOLE AND POURED THEY HEARD A SPLASH BELOW
TO FORBID SECOND MARRIAGES IN SUCH CASES WOULD BE TO EXPOSE THE PARTIES NOT ONLY TO STRONGER HARDSHIPS AND STRONG TEMPTATION BUT TO CHURCH CENSURE FOR ACTING IN OBEDIENCE TO THEIR MASTERS WHO CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN A REGULATION AT VARIANCE WITH JUSTICE TO THE SLAVES
THE CONDITION OF THE NEGROES HUCKELBY AND SNYDER AND ESPECIALLY HOW HE LIKED THE SERMON OF THE LATTER MISTER PECK WAS A KIND OF A PATRIARCH IN HIS OWN WAY TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS A MAN OF SOME TALENT
ALTHOUGH THE TERM NEGRO BALL IS APPLIED TO MOST OF THESE GATHERINGS YET A MAJORITY OF THE ATTENDANTS ARE OFTEN WHITES NEARLY ALL THE NEGRO PARTIES IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES ARE MADE UP OF QUADROON AND MULATTO GIRLS AND WHITE MEN
BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
THE TWO BOATS SOON LOCKED SO THAT THE HANDS OF THE BOATS WERE PASSING FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL AND THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT PREVAILED THROUGHOUT AMONGST BOTH PASSENGERS AND CREW
BEING IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE TO ALMOST ALL BENEVOLENT CAUSES TO WHICH HE TOOK A FANCY HE WAS A MOST LOVING FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER EXERCISED CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER HIM AND OWING TO HER PIETY AND JUDGMENT THAT INFLUENCE HAD A BENEFICIAL EFFECT
WITHOUT ANY PREMONITION SOMETIMES DEATH WAS THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE THE DISORDER BEGAN IN THE BRAIN BY AN OPPRESSIVE PAIN ACCOMPANIED OR FOLLOWED BY FEVER THE PATIENT WAS DEVOURED WITH BURNING THIRST THE STOMACH DISTRACTED BY PAINS
AND THEIR CONVERSATION HAD PASSED BY HIM UNHEEDED BUT WHEN A YOUNG GIRL MUCH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF REASONED WITH HIM IN THAT INNOCENT AND PERSUASIVE MANNER THAT WOMAN IS WONT TO USE WHEN SHE HAS ENTERED WITH HER WHOLE SOUL UPON AN OBJECT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS STOUT HEART AND HE YIELDED
YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
AT THE FEET OF HIS MISTRESS JANE FELL SENSELESS BY HIS SIDE FOR MANY DAYS SHE HAD A CONFUSED CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME GREAT AGONY BUT KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS OR BY WHOM SURROUNDED
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
CLOTEL WAS SIXTEEN AND WAS ADMITTED BY ALL TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL COLOURED OR WHITE IN THE CITY SO ATTENTIVE WAS THE YOUNG MAN TO THE QUADROON DURING THE EVENING THAT IT WAS NOTICED BY ALL AND BECAME A MATTER OF GENERAL CONVERSATION
IN ALL THE SLAVE STATES THE LAW SAYS SLAVES SHALL BE DEEMED SOLD HELD TAKEN REPUTED AND ADJUDGED IN LAW TO BE CHATTELS PERSONAL IN THE HANDS OF THEIR OWNERS AND POSSESSORS
AND SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF GOD ON THIS SUBJECT MARRIAGE IS INDEED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL CIVILISATION AND CULTURE THE ROOT OF CHURCH AND STATE
TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
WHILE THE SLAVE GIRL STOOD WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT ONE TIME LOOKING TOWARDS HER MOTHER AND SISTER AND AT ANOTHER TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HOPED WOULD BECOME HER PURCHASER
THAN TO SATISFY HIM THAT THE SCRIPTURES FAVOURED SUCH A SYSTEM OF SIN DON'T YOU SUPPOSE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES BETTER THAN YOU
FARMERS WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF RAISING SLAVES FOR THE MARKET WERE THERE SLAVE TRADERS AND SPECULATORS WERE ALSO NUMEROUSLY REPRESENTED AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS THRONG WAS ONE WHO FELT A DEEPER INTEREST IN THE RESULT OF THE SALE THAN ANY OTHER OF THE BYSTANDERS
THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR GAZE IN A FEW DAYS THE POOR GIRL DIED OF A BROKEN HEART AND WAS BURIED AT NIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE GARDEN BY THE NEGROES AND NO ONE WEPT AT THE GRAVE OF HER WHO HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY CHERISHED AND SO TENDERLY BELOVED
WHAT WAS THE EFFECT UPON THEIR MINDS THEY ALL CONTINUED WITH ONE ACCORD IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION WITH THE WOMEN STIMULATED BY THE CONFIDENT EXPECTATION THAT JESUS WOULD FULFIL HIS GRACIOUS PROMISE THEY POURED OUT THEIR HEARTS IN FERVENT SUPPLICATIONS
IT WAS AT ONE OF THESE PARTIES THAT HORATIO GREEN THE SON OF A WEALTHY GENTLEMAN OF RICHMOND WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO CLOTEL THE YOUNG MAN HAD JUST RETURNED FROM COLLEGE AND WAS IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR
MY DEAR GEORGIANA SAID MISTER PECK I MUST BE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN MY OWN VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT AND TO EXERCISE MY OWN JUDGMENT BELIEVE ME DEAR PAPA SHE REPLIED
THE VERY APPEARANCE OF THE YOUNG SOUTHERNER POINTED HIM OUT AS AN UNPRINCIPLED PROFLIGATE AND THE YOUNG GIRL NEEDED NO ONE TO TELL HER OF HER IMPENDING DOOM THE YOUNG MAID OF FIFTEEN WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED
CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
NOW MUCOUS SECRETIONS SURCHARGED THE TONGUE AND TOOK AWAY THE POWER OF SPEECH NOW THE SICK ONE SPOKE BUT IN SPEAKING HAD A FORESIGHT OF DEATH WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF THE DISEASE APPROACHED THE HEART THE GUMS WERE BLACKENED
AND ARE DISTINGUISHED FOR THEIR FASCINATING BEAUTY THE HANDSOMEST USUALLY PAYS THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR HER TIME MANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE THE FAVOURITES OF PERSONS WHO FURNISH THEM WITH THE MEANS OF PAYING THEIR OWNERS AND NOT A FEW ARE DRESSED IN THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT MANNER
FRIEND FOLLOWED FRIEND IN QUICK SUCCESSION THE SICK WERE AVOIDED FROM THE FEAR OF CONTAGION AND FOR THE SAME REASON THE DEAD WERE LEFT UNBURIED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND DEAD BODIES LAY UNCOVERED IN THE BURIAL GROUND WITH ONLY HERE AND THERE A LITTLE LIME THROWN OVER THEM
BUT ALAS WE CANNOT A FEW YEARS SINCE SOME SLAVEHOLDERS BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY IN THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE RIGHTFULNESS OF PERMITTING SLAVES TO TAKE TO THEMSELVES HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHILE THEY STILL HAD OTHERS LIVING AND APPLIED TO THEIR RELIGIOUS TEACHERS FOR ADVICE
CURRER WAS FIRST ORDERED TO ASCEND THE AUCTION STAND WHICH SHE DID WITH A TREMBLING STEP THE SLAVE MOTHER WAS SOLD TO A TRADER ALTHESA THE YOUNGEST AND WHO WAS SCARCELY LESS BEAUTIFUL THAN HER SISTER WAS SOLD TO THE SAME TRADER FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
SWEPT AWAY BY THE RAGING DISORDER THAT YEAR LIKE TOO MANY MORTON HAD BEEN DEALING EXTENSIVELY IN LANDS AND STOCKS AND THOUGH APPARENTLY IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES WAS IN REALITY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN DEBT
WHEN HE DESIGNED TO DO US GOOD HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE FORM OF A SERVANT HE TOOK HIS STATION AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY HE VOLUNTARILY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE POOR AND THE DESPISED THE WARNING VOICES OF JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL WERE RAISED IN OLDEN TIME AGAINST SIN
AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE THROUGH EACH OTHER BECOME CONSCIOUS OF COMPLETE HUMANITY AND EVERY HUMAN FEELING AND EVERY HUMAN VIRTUE SO CHILDREN AT THEIR FIRST AWAKENING IN THE FOND COVENANT OF LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS BOTH OF WHOM ARE TENDERLY CONCERNED FOR THE SAME OBJECT
WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU
IN VAIN SOUGHT RELIEF IN EFFORTS TO DISBURDEN ITSELF FIERY VEINS STREAKED THE EYE THE FACE WAS INFLAMED AND DYED OF A DARK DULL RED COLOUR THE EARS FROM TIME TO TIME RANG PAINFULLY
ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THE PEOPLE OF NEW ORLEANS WERE VISITED WITH ONE OF THESE EPIDEMICS IT APPEARED IN A FORM UNUSUALLY REPULSIVE AND DEADLY
IN THE WAY OF RAISING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS HE TOOK THE LEAD OF ALL OTHERS IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD EVERYTHING HE DID HE DID FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AS HE SAID HE QUOTED SCRIPTURE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DID
I DON'T THINK THAT THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY
IF A SLAVE THEY ARE SLAVES MORTON WAS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAND
DESPAIR PAINTED ITSELF IN THE EYES AND SOBS WITH LONG INTERVALS OF SILENCE FORMED THE ONLY LANGUAGE FROM EACH SIDE OF THE MOUTH SPREAD FOAM TINGED WITH BLACK AND BURNT BLOOD BLUE STREAKS MINGLED WITH THE YELLOW ALL OVER THE FRAME
SAID GEORGIANA WILL YOU GRANT ME ONE FAVOUR OR RATHER MAKE ME A PROMISE I CAN'T TELL MY DEAR TILL I KNOW WHAT IT IS REPLIED MISTER PECK IF IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST I WILL COMPLY WITH YOUR WISH CONTINUED HE I HOPE MY DEAR ANSWERED SHE
AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
WHO MAY CORRECT AND CHASTISE HIM THOUGH NOT WITH UNUSUAL RIGOUR OR SO AS TO MAIM AND MUTILATE HIM OR EXPOSE HIM TO THE DANGER OF LOSS OF LIFE OR TO CAUSE HIS DEATH THE SLAVE TO REMAIN A SLAVE MUST BE SENSIBLE THAT THERE IS NO APPEAL FROM HIS MASTER
AS HER LOVER WAS RECEIVING HER IN HIS ARMS AT THIS MOMENT THE SHARP SOUND OF A RIFLE WAS HEARD
IN ALL THE LARGE TOWNS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES THERE IS A CLASS OF SLAVES WHO ARE PERMITTED TO HIRE THEIR TIME OF THEIR OWNERS AND FOR WHICH THEY PAY A HIGH PRICE THESE ARE MULATTO WOMEN OR QUADROONS AS THEY ARE FAMILIARLY KNOWN
AT THE TIME OF THE DECEASE OF HER MASTER CURRER'S DAUGHTERS CLOTEL AND ALTHESA WERE AGED RESPECTIVELY SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN YEARS AND BOTH LIKE MOST OF THEIR OWN SEX IN AMERICA WERE WELL GROWN
BUT OF LATER YEARS HAD BEEN A LAUNDRESS OR WASHERWOMAN AND WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A WOMAN OF GREAT TASTE IN GETTING UP LINEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON BY WHOM SHE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS
AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING'S VISIT AND AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS LEAVING HE SAID TO THE GIRL YOU SHALL SOON BE FREE AND YOUR OWN MISTRESS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THE DAY OF SALE BROUGHT AN UNUSUAL LARGE NUMBER TOGETHER TO COMPETE FOR THE PROPERTY TO BE SOLD
THIS INVISIBLE AND INCALCULABLE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL LIFE ACTS MORE UPON THE CHILD THAN ALL THE EFFORTS OF EDUCATION WHETHER BY MEANS OF INSTRUCTION PRECEPT OR EXHORTATION
AND WITH ALL THE TIMIDITY THAT SUCH A LIFE COULD PRODUCE BARTERED AWAY LIKE CATTLE IN SMITHFIELD MARKET ELLEN THE ELDEST WAS SOLD TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO PURCHASED HER AS HE SAID FOR A HOUSEKEEPER
BUT ONLY GRANT MY REQUEST NOT TO ALLUDE TO THE BIBLE AS SANCTIONING SLAVERY WHEN SPEAKING WITH MISTER CARLTON WELL RETURNED HE
CARLTON THOUGH A SCHOOLFELLOW OF THE PARSON'S WAS NEVERTHELESS NEARLY TEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR AND THOUGH NOT AN AVOWED INFIDEL WAS HOWEVER A FREETHINKER AND ONE WHO TOOK NO NOTE OF TO MORROW AND FOR THIS REASON GEORGIANA TOOK PECULIAR INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN
EXCEPT AN OLD NEGRESS WHO ACTED AS HER SERVANT THE SMILES WITH WHICH THE YOUNG MAN MET HER WERE INDIGNANTLY SPURNED BUT SHE WAS THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER AND COULD HOPE FOR JUSTICE AND MERCY ONLY THROUGH HIM JANE THOUGH ONLY IN HER FIFTEENTH YEAR
CURRER EARLY RESOLVED TO BRING HER DAUGHTERS UP AS LADIES AS SHE TERMED IT AND THEREFORE IMPOSED LITTLE OR NO WORK UPON THEM AS HER DAUGHTERS GREW OLDER CURRER HAD TO PAY A STIPULATED PRICE FOR THEM
IT UNITES ALL WHICH ENNOBLES AND BEAUTIFIES LIFE SYMPATHY KINDNESS OF WILL AND DEED GRATITUDE DEVOTION AND EVERY DELICATE INTIMATE FEELING AS THE ONLY ASYLUM FOR TRUE EDUCATION IT IS THE FIRST AND LAST SANCTUARY OF HUMAN CULTURE
TO ANY ONE WHO WISHES TO RAISE A STRONG AND HEALTHY LOT OF SERVANTS FOR THEIR OWN USE ALSO SEVERAL MULATTO GIRLS OF RARE PERSONAL QUALITIES TWO OF THEM VERY SUPERIOR ANY GENTLEMAN OR LADY WISHING TO PURCHASE CAN TAKE ANY OF THE ABOVE SLAVES ON TRIAL FOR A WEEK
NOW ARMED HER HAND WITH THE READY MEANS OF DEATH THE MORNING AFTER HER ARRIVAL SHE WAS FOUND IN HER CHAMBER A CORPSE SHE HAD TAKEN POISON JANE WAS PURCHASED BY A DASHING YOUNG MAN WHO HAD JUST COME INTO THE POSSESSION OF A LARGE FORTUNE
AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING UP TO THAT FAITH THAT SHE PROFESSED AND BELIEVED IN IF SHE DID NOT EXERT HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO SAVE THE THOUGHTLESS MAN FROM HIS DOWNWARD CAREER AND IN THIS SHE SUCCEEDED TO HER MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
JEFFERSON BEING CALLED TO WASHINGTON TO FILL A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT CURRER WAS LEFT BEHIND AND THUS SHE TOOK HERSELF TO THE BUSINESS OF WASHING BY WHICH MEANS SHE PAID HER MASTER MISTER GRAVES AND SUPPORTED HERSELF AND TWO CHILDREN
THERE SHE STOOD WITH A COMPLEXION AS WHITE AS MOST OF THOSE WHO WERE WAITING WITH A WISH TO BECOME HER PURCHASERS HER FEATURES AS FINELY DEFINED AS ANY OF HER SEX OF PURE ANGLO SAXON HER LONG BLACK WAVY HAIR DONE UP IN THE NEATEST MANNER HER FORM TALL AND GRACEFUL
CLOTEL WAS SOLD FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT HER PURCHASER WAS HORATIO GREEN THUS CLOSED A NEGRO SALE AT WHICH TWO DAUGHTERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON THE WRITER OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE AND ONE OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC
BUT SO GRAND IN ITS SITUATION IN THE DESOLATE SUBLIMITY WHICH REIGNED AROUND IN THE REVERENTIAL MURMUR OF THE WAVES THAT WASHED ITS BASE THAT THOUGH PICTURESQUE IT WAS A FOREST PRISON HERE THE YOUNG LADY SAW NO ONE
WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
AND MUST NOT THIS CONCLUSION BE STRENGTHENED WHEN THEY HEAR MINISTERS OF TALENT AND LEARNING DECLARE THAT THE BIBLE DOES SANCTION SLAVEHOLDING AND THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE A DISCIPLINABLE OFFENCE IN CHURCHES AND MUST NOT ALL DOUBT BE DISSIPATED WHEN ONE OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS IN OUR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES
AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT APPEARED IN A NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED IN RICHMOND THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA NOTICE THIRTY EIGHT NEGROES WILL BE OFFERED FOR SALE ON MONDAY NOVEMBER TENTH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK
GEORGIANA'S FIRST OBJECT HOWEVER WAS TO AWAKEN IN CARLTON'S BREAST A LOVE FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE YOUNG MAN HAD OFTEN SAT UNDER THE SOUND OF THE GOSPEL WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE HE HAD HEARD MEN TALK WHO HAD GROWN GREY BENDING OVER THE SCRIPTURES
SAID IN A SPEECH IN THE LEGISLATURE OF HIS NATIVE STATE THAT THE BLOOD OF THE FIRST AMERICAN STATESMEN COURSED THROUGH THE VEINS OF THE SLAVE OF THE SOUTH IN ALL THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE SLAVE STATES THE REAL NEGRO OR CLEAR BLACK
CLOTEL WAS THE LAST AND AS WAS EXPECTED COMMANDED A HIGHER PRICE THAN ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED FOR SALE THAT DAY THE APPEARANCE OF CLOTEL ON THE AUCTION BLOCK CREATED A DEEP SENSATION AMONGST THE CROWD
AND THE ANSWER AS THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW DID NOT MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE ONE WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN WHETHER IN A CASE OF INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO PRECLUDE ALL PROSPECT OF FUTURE INTERCOURSE THE PARTIES OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO MARRY AGAIN
THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
SOON THE YOUNG MAIDEN WAS SEEN DESCENDING AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC LOVER WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS MISTRESS THE PLANTER HAD BEEN OUT ON AN HUNTING EXCURSION AND RETURNING HOME SAW HIS VICTIM
IT IS THE MOST INTIMATE COVENANT OF HEART FORMED AMONG MANKIND AND FOR MANY PERSONS THE ONLY RELATION IN WHICH THEY FEEL THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY IT GIVES SCOPE FOR EVERY HUMAN VIRTUE SINCE EACH OF THESE IS DEVELOPED FROM THE LOVE AND CONFIDENCE WHICH HERE PREDOMINATE
SHE IS A RARE COOK A GOOD WASHER AND WILL SUIT YOU TO A T I AM SURE IF YOU BUY ME I HOPE YOU WILL BUY MY DAUGHTER TOO SAID THE WOMAN IN RATHER AN EXCITED MANNER
THE GIRL WAS TAKEN TO HIS RESIDENCE NINE MILES FROM THE CITY SHE SOON HOWEVER KNEW FOR WHAT PURPOSE SHE HAD BEEN BOUGHT AND AN EDUCATED AND CULTIVATED MIND AND TASTE WHICH MADE HER SEE AND UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT WAS HER DEGRADATION
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED FOR SUCH A GIRL AS THIS GENTLEMEN SHE IS WORTH A DEAL MORE THAN THAT SUM YOU CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW THE VALUE OF THE ARTICLE YOU ARE BIDDING UPON HERE GENTLEMEN I HOLD IN MY HAND A PAPER CERTIFYING THAT SHE HAS A GOOD MORAL CHARACTER
AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
YES SIR RESPONDED JERRY AS HE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES SMITH TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE BILL OF SALE AND HANDED IT TO JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SAYING
I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
WHERE THE SLAVE IS PLACED BY LAW ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MAN WHO CLAIMS HIM BODY AND SOUL AS PROPERTY WHAT ELSE COULD BE EXPECTED THAN THE MOST DEPRAVED SOCIAL CONDITION
AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
THAT HORATIO GREEN WAS SEATED IN THE SMALL GARDEN BEHIND CURRER'S COTTAGE
SEVEN HUNDRED AH GENTLEMEN THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS PAPER ALSO STATES THAT SHE IS VERY INTELLIGENT EIGHT HUNDRED SHE IS A DEVOTED CHRISTIAN AND PERFECTLY TRUSTWORTHY NINE HUNDRED NINE FIFTY TEN ELEVEN
MEMBERS IN GOOD AND REGULAR STANDING FELLOWSHIPPED THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM EXCEPT BY A FEW ANTI SLAVERY CHURCHES GENERALLY DESPISED AS ULTRA AND RADICAL REDUCE THEIR FELLOW MEN TO THE CONDITION OF CHATTELS AND BY FORCE KEEP THEM IN THAT STATE OF DEGRADATION
WHY GEORGIANA MY DEAR YOU ARE MAD AIN'T YOU EXCLAIMED HE IN AN EXCITED TONE THE POOR GIRL REMAINED SILENT THE FATHER SAW IN A MOMENT THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TOO SHARPLY AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID
AND THEIR EXECUTORS ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS TO ALL INTENTS CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER A SLAVE IS ONE WHO IS IN THE POWER OF A MASTER TO WHOM HE BELONGS THE MASTER MAY SELL HIM
ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER HUSBANDS AND WIVES WERE SEPARATED WITH A DEGREE OF INDIFFERENCE THAT IS UNKNOWN IN ANY OTHER RELATION OF LIFE EXCEPT THAT OF SLAVERY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE TORN FROM EACH OTHER
HER MORAL CHARACTER FOR TWO HUNDRED HER IMPROVED INTELLECT FOR ONE HUNDRED HER CHRISTIANITY FOR THREE HUNDRED AND HER CHASTITY AND VIRTUE FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE AND THIS TOO IN A CITY THRONGED WITH CHURCHES WHOSE TALL SPIRES LOOK LIKE SO MANY SIGNALS POINTING TO HEAVEN
ONE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT EVENING AS SHE WAS SEATED AT THE WINDOW SHE PERCEIVED THE FIGURE OF A MAN BENEATH HER WINDOW AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT IT WAS HER MASTER BUT THE TALL FIGURE OF THE STRANGER SOON CONVINCED HER THAT IT WAS ANOTHER
LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THE IDEA THAT SLAVERY IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS PROFITABLE TO US SLAVEHOLDING IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT TO TAKE FROM A MAN HIS EARNINGS IS THEFT BUT TO TAKE THE EARNER IS A COMPOUND LIFE LONG THEFT
HAVE WE LESS PRECIOUS PROMISES IN THE SCRIPTURES OF TRUTH MAY WE NOT CLAIM OF OUR GOD THE BLESSING PROMISED UNTO THOSE WHO CONSIDER THE POOR
HE NOT ONLY HAD A GOOD EDUCATION BUT WAS A MAN OF GREAT ELOQUENCE AND HAD A WONDERFUL COMMAND OF LANGUAGE HE TOO EITHER HAD OR THOUGHT HE HAD POETICAL GENIUS AND WAS OFTEN SENDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATCHEZ FREE TRADER AND OTHER PERIODICALS
CONTINUE IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION THAT GOD WILL GRANT US THE SUPPLIES OF HIS SPIRIT
JAMES MORTON ON HIS ARRIVAL IN NEW ORLEANS FELT PROUD OF HIS NIECES AND PROMISED THEM A HOME WITH HIS OWN FAMILY IN VERMONT LITTLE DREAMING THAT HIS BROTHER HAD MARRIED A SLAVE WOMAN AND THAT HIS NIECES WERE SLAVES
YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
READER WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT AMONGST THE SLAVE POPULATION NO SAFEGUARD IS THROWN AROUND VIRTUE AND NO INDUCEMENT HELD OUT TO SLAVE WOMEN TO BE CHASTE YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN WE TELL YOU THAT IMMORALITY AND VICE PERVADE THE CITIES OF THE SOUTHERN STATES
THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS OPPOSED TO SLAVEHOLDING IN ITS SPIRIT AND ITS PRINCIPLES IT CLASSES MENSTEALERS AMONG MURDERERS AND IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL WHO WISH TO MEET GOD IN PEACE TO DISCHARGE THAT DUTY IN SPREADING THESE PRINCIPLES
THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
WE HAVE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO SHOW THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CHATTEL SLAVERY IN AMERICA UNDERMINES THE ENTIRE SOCIAL CONDITION OF MAN SO AS TO PREPARE THE READER FOR THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE OF SLAVE LIFE IN THAT OTHERWISE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS COUNTRY
AND WHOSE MINISTERS PREACH THAT SLAVERY IS A GOD ORDAINED INSTITUTION WHAT WORDS CAN TELL THE INHUMANITY THE ATROCITY AND THE IMMORALITY OF THAT DOCTRINE WHICH FROM EXALTED OFFICE COMMENDS SUCH A CRIME TO THE FAVOUR OF ENLIGHTENED AND CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
THAT HE MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM SUCH A FATE HE EVEN OFFERED TO MORTGAGE HIS LITTLE FARM IN VERMONT FOR THE AMOUNT WHICH YOUNG SLAVE WOMEN OF THEIR AGES WOULD FETCH BUT THE CREDITORS PLEADED THAT THEY WERE AN EXTRA ARTICLE AND WOULD SELL FOR MORE THAN COMMON SLAVES
WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL
AS SOON AS JANE SAW THIS SHE TOOK THE SHEETS FROM HER BED TORE THEM INTO STRINGS TIED THEM TOGETHER AND LET ONE END DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE A MOMENT MORE AND ONE END OF THE ROPE LADDER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE FASTENED IT INSIDE THE ROOM
LET US NOT FORGET WHAT FOLLOWED THEREFORE THUS SAITH THE LORD YE HAVE NOT HARKENED UNTO ME IN PROCLAIMING LIBERTY EVERY ONE TO HIS BROTHER AND EVERY ONE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR BEHOLD I PROCLAIM A LIBERTY FOR YOU SAITH THE LORD TO THE SWORD TO THE PESTILENCE AND TO THE FAMINE
ALTHESA ALTHOUGH AS WHITE AS MOST WHITE WOMEN IN A SOUTHERN CLIME WAS AS WE ALREADY KNOW BORN A SLAVE BY THE LAWS OF ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES THE CHILDREN FOLLOW THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER IF THE MOTHER IS FREE THE CHILDREN ARE FREE
UNTIL HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HER BUT HOW COULD HE EVER OBTAIN A SIGHT OF HER EVEN IF HE WISHED LOCKED UP AS SHE WAS IN HER MASTER'S MANSION AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF WHAT HER MASTER TERMED OBSTINACY ON HER PART THE YOUNG GIRL WAS PLACED IN AN UPPER CHAMBER
WERE HIS SLAVES YET SUCH WAS THE FACT AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DISEASE WITH WHICH HENRY MORTON HAD SO SUDDENLY BEEN REMOVED HIS BROTHER WENT TO NEW ORLEANS TO GIVE WHAT AID HE COULD IN SETTLING UP THE AFFAIRS
TO GRANT REPENTANCE TO OUR GUILTY COUNTRY AND PERMIT US TO AID IN PREPARING THE WAY FOR THE GLORIOUS SECOND ADVENT OF THE MESSIAH BY PREACHING DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON DOORS TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND
THIS WAS YOUNG GREEN TRUE TO HIS PROMISE HE WAS THERE WITH A BLANK BANK CHECK IN HIS POCKET AWAITING WITH IMPATIENCE TO ENTER THE LIST AS A BIDDER FOR THE BEAUTIFUL SLAVE THE LESS VALUABLE SLAVES WERE FIRST PLACED UPON THE AUCTION BLOCK
SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
HE HAD NO SOONER RECEIVED HER LETTER THAN HE SET OUT FOR NEW ORLEANS AND FINDING ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY RESOLVED TO FOLLOW HER THERE HE WAS
I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
TWELVE HUNDRED HERE THE SALE CAME TO A DEAD STAND
COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE GROSSEST LANGUAGE AND SHRINKING FROM THE RUDE HANDS THAT EXAMINED THE GRACEFUL PROPORTIONS OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FRAMES AFTER A FIERCE CONTEST BETWEEN THE BIDDERS THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SOLD ONE FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
THE PROGRESS OF THE HEAT WITHIN WAS MARKED BY YELLOWISH SPOTS WHICH SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE BODY IF THEN A HAPPY CRISIS CAME NOT ALL HOPE WAS GONE SOON THE BREATH INFECTED THE AIR WITH A FETID ODOUR THE LIPS WERE GLAZED
THE GIRLS THEMSELVES HAD NEVER HEARD THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD BEEN A SLAVE AND THEREFORE KNEW NOTHING OF THE DANGER HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS AN INVENTORY OF THE PROPERTY WAS MADE OUT BY JAMES MORTON AND PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE CREDITORS AND THE YOUNG LADIES WITH THEIR UNCLE
OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
THIS READER IS AN UNVARNISHED NARRATIVE OF ONE DOOMED BY THE LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN STATES TO BE A SLAVE IT TELLS NOT ONLY ITS OWN STORY OF GRIEF BUT SPEAKS OF A THOUSAND WRONGS AND WOES BESIDE WHICH NEVER SEE THE LIGHT
THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
WHICH HE SAID HAD COME UNDER HIS OWN OBSERVATION AT THIS JUNCTURE THE SCENE WAS INDEED STRANGE LAUGHING JOKING SWEARING SMOKING SPITTING AND TALKING KEPT UP A CONTINUAL HUM AND NOISE AMONGST THE CROWD
WITH THE GROWING POPULATION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF AMERICA THERE IS A FEARFUL INCREASE OF HALF WHITES MOST OF WHOSE FATHERS ARE SLAVEOWNERS AND THEIR MOTHERS SLAVES SOCIETY DOES NOT FROWN UPON THE MAN WHO SITS WITH HIS MULATTO CHILD UPON HIS KNEE
AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
PROBABLY FOR STRENGTH TO DO THE WORK WHICH HE HAD APPOINTED THEM UNTO FOR THEY FELT THAT WITHOUT HIM THEY COULD DO NOTHING AND THEY CONSECRATED THEMSELVES ON THE ALTAR OF GOD TO THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS ENTERPRISE OF PREACHING THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST TO A LOST AND PERISHING WORLD
ALL THE MORE BITTER AND DREADFUL BECAUSE NO HELP CAN RELIEVE NO SYMPATHY CAN MITIGATE
THE MARRIAGE RELATION THE OLDEST AND MOST SACRED INSTITUTION GIVEN TO MAN BY HIS CREATOR IS UNKNOWN AND UNRECOGNISED IN THE SLAVE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD THAT WE COULD SAY THAT THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE SLAVE STATES WERE BETTER THAN THE LAWS
THE YOUNG LADIES AS SLAVES AND THE UNCLE UPON THE CHARGE OF ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THE PROPERTY OF HIS DECEASED BROTHER MORTON WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HORROR AT THE IDEA OF HIS NIECES BEING CLAIMED AS SLAVES AND ASKED FOR TIME
TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH THE SEA THIS WAS A MOST SINGULAR SPOT REMOTE IN A DENSE FOREST SPREADING OVER THE SUMMIT OF A CLIFF THAT ROSE ABRUPTLY TO A GREAT HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA
TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
SUCH WAS THE ANSWER FROM A COMMITTEE OF THE SHILOH BAPTIST ASSOCIATION AND INSTEAD OF RECEIVING LIGHT THOSE WHO ASKED THE QUESTION WERE PLUNGED INTO DEEPER DARKNESS A SIMILAR QUESTION WAS PUT TO THE SAVANNAH RIVER ASSOCIATION
AND TOLD THAT THAT WOULD BE HER HOME UNTIL SHE SHOULD YIELD TO HER MASTER'S WISHES THERE SHE REMAINED MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DAILY VISIT FROM HER MASTER SHE SAW NO ONE BUT THE OLD NEGRESS WHO WAITED UPON HER
SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
NIGHT PASSED AWAY IN DREARINESS TO HER AND THE NEXT MORNING SHE VIEWED THE SPOT BENEATH HER WINDOW WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIM WHO HAD STOOD THERE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT EVENING RETURNED AND WITH IT THE HOPE OF AGAIN SEEING THE MAN SHE LOVED
WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
CURRER WAS A BRIGHT MULATTO AND OF PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE THOUGH THEN NEARLY FORTY YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD HIRED HER TIME FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS DURING WHICH TIME SHE HAD LIVED IN RICHMOND
GEORGIANA HAD SUCCEEDED IN RIVETING THE ATTENTION OF CARLTON DURING HER CONVERSATION AND AS SHE WAS FINISHING HER LAST SENTENCE SHE OBSERVED THE SILENT TEAR STEALING DOWN THE CHEEK OF THE NEWLY BORN CHILD OF GOD AT THIS JUNCTURE HER FATHER ENTERED AND CARLTON LEFT THE ROOM DEAR PAPA
THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
TO PREVENT THE AIR BECOMING INFECTED THE NEGRO WHOSE HOME IS IN A HOT CLIMATE WAS NOT PROOF AGAINST THE DISEASE MANY PLANTATIONS HAD TO SUSPEND THEIR WORK FOR WANT OF SLAVES TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE CARRIED OFF BY THE FEVER
THE AUCTIONEER COMMENCED BY SAYING THAT MISS CLOTEL HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR THE LAST BECAUSE SHE WAS THE MOST VALUABLE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN REAL ALBINO FIT FOR A FANCY GIRL FOR ANY ONE SHE ENJOYS GOOD HEALTH AND HAS A SWEET TEMPER HOW MUCH DO YOU SAY
WHEN ALSO THE NEW TESTAMENT EXHIBITS SUCH WORDS OF REBUKE AS THESE BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABOURERS WHO HAVE REAPED DOWN YOUR FIELDS WHICH IS OF YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD CRIETH
WERE DISPOSED OF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER O GOD MY EVERY HEART STRING CRIES DOST THOU THESE SCENES BEHOLD IN THIS OUR BOASTED CHRISTIAN LAND AND MUST THE TRUTH BE TOLD
FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION IS THE POOR PRIVILEGE TO TURN THE KEY UPON THE CAPTIVE FREEDOM HE'S AS FAR FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE EARTH AND AIR WHO WATCHES O'ER THE CHAINS AS THEY WHO WEAR DURING CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR
AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
ALL REMEDIES WERE USELESS THIS WAS THE YELLOW FEVER THE DISORDER SPREAD ALARM AND CONFUSION THROUGHOUT THE CITY ON AN AVERAGE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DIED DAILY IN THE MIDST OF DISORDER AND CONFUSION DEATH HEAPED VICTIMS ON VICTIMS
WHAT INDIGNATION FROM ALL THE WORLD IS NOT DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE WHO PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND POWER TO KEEP IN EXISTENCE SUCH AN INSTITUTION NATURE ABHORS IT THE AGE REPELS IT AND CHRISTIANITY NEEDS ALL HER MEEKNESS TO FORGIVE IT
THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
AND THE OTHER FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE NEED NOT ADD THAT HAD THOSE YOUNG GIRLS BEEN SOLD FOR MERE HOUSE SERVANTS OR FIELD HANDS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT ONE HALF THE SUMS THEY DID
BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DE MARKET AN ANYBODY AXE YOU HOW OLD YOU IS AN YOU TELL EM FORTY FIVE MARSER WILL TIE YOU UP AN GIB YOU DE WHIP LIKE SMOKE
SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
WHILST ITS MOTHER STANDS A SLAVE BEHIND HIS CHAIR THE LATE HENRY CLAY SOME YEARS SINCE PREDICTED THAT THE ABOLITION OF NEGRO SLAVERY WOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE AMALGAMATION OF THE RACES JOHN RANDOLPH A DISTINGUISHED SLAVEHOLDER OF VIRGINIA AND A PROMINENT STATESMAN
YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
IT WAS A MARRIAGE WHICH THE LAW DID NOT RECOGNISE AND THEREFORE SHE WHOM HE THOUGHT TO BE HIS WIFE WAS IN FACT NOTHING MORE THAN HIS SLAVE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS HAD HE KNOWN THIS AND ALSO KNOWN THAT HIS TWO DAUGHTERS ELLEN AND JANE
ANSWERED THE MAN OH UNCLE JIM IS IT YES DEN YOU MUST HAVE OFF DEM DARE WHISKERS OF YOURS AN WHEN YOU GET TO ORLEANS YOU MUST GREASE DAT FACE AN MAKE IT LOOK SHINEY
AND THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THIS GRAVE AND IMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS TREATED IS A SERVANT WHOSE HUSBAND OR WIFE HAS BEEN SOLD BY HIS OR HER MASTER INTO A DISTANT COUNTRY TO BE PERMITTED TO MARRY AGAIN THE QUERY WAS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE WHO MADE THE FOLLOWING REPORT
AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
BUT HOW COULD SHE COMMUNICATE WITH HIM SHE DARED NOT TRUST THE OLD NEGRESS WITH HER SECRET FOR FEAR THAT IT MIGHT REACH HER MASTER JANE WROTE A HASTY NOTE AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHICH WAS EAGERLY PICKED UP BY THE YOUNG MAN AND HE SOON DISAPPEARED IN THE WOODS
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS CRIED THE AUCTIONEER AND THE MAIDEN WAS STRUCK FOR THAT SUM
VERY GENERALLY DEFEND THE CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO DO AND ACCORD TO THEM A FAIR CHRISTIAN CHARACTER
WHICH AFTER DISCUSSION WAS ADOPTED THAT IN VIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SERVANTS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE PLACED THE COMMITTEE ARE UNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT IT IS BETTER TO PERMIT SERVANTS THUS CIRCUMSTANCED TO TAKE ANOTHER HUSBAND OR WIFE
ALL TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO EPIDEMICS OF A MOST DESTRUCTIVE NATURE THE INHABITANTS OF NEW ORLEANS LOOK WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER SMALL POX OR CHOLERA IN THE HOT SEASON AS THE LONDONER DOES FOR FOG IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
FORGETFUL OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THE OCEAN PIRATE'S FIEND LIKE FORM SHALL SINK BENEATH THE VENGEANCE STORM HIS HEART OF STEEL SHALL QUAKE BEFORE THE BATTLE DIN AND HAVOC ROAR
IN A MANNER UNKNOWN IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE NORTHERN STATES INDEED MOST OF THE SLAVE WOMEN HAVE NO HIGHER ASPIRATION THAN THAT OF BECOMING THE FINELY DRESSED MISTRESS OF SOME WHITE MAN AND AT NEGRO BALLS AND PARTIES THIS CLASS OF WOMEN USUALLY CUT THE GREATEST FIGURE
THE NEGROES ARE IN GOOD CONDITION SOME OF THEM VERY PRIME AMONG THEM ARE SEVERAL MECHANICS ABLE BODIED FIELD HANDS PLOUGHBOYS AND WOMEN WITH CHILDREN AT THE BREAST AND SOME OF THEM VERY PROLIFIC IN THEIR GENERATING QUALITIES AFFORDING A RARE OPPORTUNITY
I WANT A GOOD TRUSTY WOMAN FOR HOUSE SERVICE SAID THE STRANGER AS THEY ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE WALKER'S SLAVES WERE KEPT HERE SHE IS AND NO MISTAKE REPLIED THE TRADER STAND UP CURRER MY GAL HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES TO SEE IF YOU WILL SUIT HIM
AND THIS HE HAD DONE WITHOUT EVER HAVING ASKED FOR HER LOVE AND HE HAD EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ALLURE DICK AND HAD LISTENED TO AND HAD TALKED WHOLE PAGES OUT OF BELL'S LIFE ON HIS OWN BEHALF IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED
THE TIME SHOULD COME HE WOULD BUY HIS DAUGHTER'S RELEASE AT ANY PRICE THAT MIGHT BE DEMANDED MISTER WALKER THE ATTORNEY HAD AS YET BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE NOTHING
THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
IN AMERICA I KNOW SEXTY TOLD ME HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO GO ANYWHERE WHILE HE OWES SEXTY SUCH A LOT OF MONEY HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING
THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
I HOPE CORA YOU ARE NOT STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF NOT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT THINK ME FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH ANY JUDGMENT OF MY OWN
IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
I CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT MISSUS PARKER WHAT YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF HAS ADDED GREATLY TO MY SORROWS MY HUSBAND IS TALKING OF GOING AWAY
ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
THAT HE WOULD LET HER GO I HAVE DONE IT SHE SAID THAT NIGHT AND I COULD BEAR IT BETTER IF YOU WOULD LET ME BEAR IT ALONE BUT HE ONLY KISSED HER
OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
THAT HAS RUINED HIM WHAT ARE WE TO DO MISSUS LOPEZ I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY HUSBAND'S BUSINESS MISSUS PARKER YOU'RE ONE WITH HIM AIN'T YOU
IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
BUT SHE IS HIS WIFE SIR WHERE AM I TO GO IF NOT TO WHERE HE LIVES AM I TO PUT UP WITH EVERYTHING GONE AND MY POOR HUSBAND
NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
NO DOUBT YOUR PAPA WILL HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU JUST NOW SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WILL SAY TO HIM IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE MAN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO AND STICK TO IT HE HAS MADE A REGULAR OFFER AND GIRLS IN THESE DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THEIR FATHER'S SLAVES
YES I UNDERSTAND SHE SAW PAPA ALSO IF YOU OWE HIM MONEY SHOULD IT NOT BE PAID MY DEAREST LOVE
WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
SO READY AND SO NATURAL AN ASSISTANCE TO HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES BUT EMILY WHARTON WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE HER AUNT NOR HAD MISSUS WHARTON BEEN AT ALL LIKE MISSUS ROBY NO DOUBT THE CONTACT WAS DANGEROUS
DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS MAN SPEAK OF HIS FATHER I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER DID OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FAMILY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS SUSPICIOUS
I CANNOT MAKE HIM OTHERWISE WILL HE DO NOTHING FOR US I WILL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW ABOUT HIM THEN MISTER WHARTON DID TELL HER ALL THAT HE KNEW
YOU'LL KNOW NOTHING OF WANT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT ARE WE TO DO MISSUS LOPEZ I'M THE WIFE OF THAT POOR CREATURE AND YOU'RE THE WIFE OF THE MAN
WHICH SHE WAS RUNNING AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD DESTROYED HER FATHER AS WELL AS HERSELF ALL THAT SHE COULD DO WAS TO BE PERSISTENT IN HER PRAYER
OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
THIS EVENING MISTER WHARTON THEREFORE RETURNED FROM HIS CHAMBERS EARLY BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE HOUSE HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN IN THE DINING ROOM WITH MISSUS LOPEZ
THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
I LOOK TO YOU TO TELL ME WHAT ME AND MY CHILDREN IS TO DO HE'S YOUR HUSBAND MISSUS LOPEZ YES MISSUS PARKER HE IS MY HUSBAND
I WOULD NOT WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH ASKING IF THERE HAS BEEN INTIMACY BETWEEN YOU SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE COME NATURALLY AS A THING OF COURSE YOU HAVE MADE HIM NO PROMISE OH NO PAPA
AND THAT SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION FOR WHICH HE HAD FIRST ASKED WAS ACCORDED TO HIM IT MAY BE A QUESTION WHETHER ON THE WHOLE THE DUCHESS DID NOT WORK HARDER THAN HE DID
IF ANYBODY HAD EVER COME TO ME AND SAID MY HUSBAND HAD ROBBED HIM I'D NEVER HAVE STOPPED TILL I KNEW THE TRUTH OF IT IF ANY WOMAN HAD EVER SAID TO ME
AND GIVE HER A WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT HE WILL NEVER TROUBLE HER AGAIN BUT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS ONE WHICH MISTER WALKER FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT
TO THOSE WHO WERE ALLOWED TO LOVE HER NO WOMAN WAS MORE LOVABLE THERE WAS INNATE IN HER AN APPRECIATION OF HER OWN POSITION AS A WOMAN AND WITH IT A PRINCIPLE OF SELF DENIAL AS A HUMAN BEING WHICH IT WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF ANY MISSUS ROBY TO DESTROY
THE YOUNG MAN MAY BECOME LORD CHANCELLOR OR AT ANY RATE EARN HIS BREAD COMFORTABLY AS A COUNTY COURT JUDGE BUT THE GIRL CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LITTLE ELSE THAN THE CHANCE OF HAVING A GOOD MAN FOR HER HUSBAND A GOOD MAN
AND THE AMOUNT OF SALARY WHICH WAS TO BE ATTACHED TO IT WHETHER HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU I CANNOT SAY I SHOULD THINK NOT UNLESS HE BE FORCED
AND NOW THERE IS NOTHING WHAT ARE WE TO DO THE WOMAN WAS SEATED ON A CHAIR LEANING FORWARD WITH HER TWO HANDS ON HER KNEES THE DAY WAS WET
YOU TOLD HIM TO GO YES BUT I AM GLAD THAT HE DID NOT OBEY ME THERE MUST BE AN END TO THIS SOON I SUPPOSE I DO NOT KNOW PAPA
HE'D PREY UPON ANYBODY AS HE COULD GET A HOLD OF AND SO MISTER WHARTON YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME IF YOUR WANT BE IMMEDIATE I CAN RELIEVE IT
IN THAT CASE I COULD HAVE JUDGED FOR MYSELF I SUPPOSE EVERY GIRL WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED YOU BEFORE I DID THAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO ACCEPT HIM PAPA I DO LOVE HIM
AND SOBBED OVER HER AND HELD HER CLOSE TO HIS HEART WITH HIS CLINGING ARMS IN A MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD NEVER HELD HER IN THEIR OLD HAPPY DAYS
THE POOR WOMAN BURST INTO TEARS WHO'S TO TRUST HIM WITH BUSINESS NOW HE'S THAT BROKEN HEARTED THAT HE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN ONLY TO THE BOTTLE
THIS SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH NOT MEANING IT ALTOGETHER BUT YET HALF MEANING IT I HAVE ASKED HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE OFFICE SAID THE DUKE SOLEMNLY BECAUSE I AM TOLD THAT HE IS FIT FOR IT
NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
WHY COULDN'T HE LET SEXTY ALONE WHY SHOULD THE LIKE OF HIM BE TAKING THE BREAD OUT OF MY CHILDREN'S MOUTHS WHAT HAD WE EVER DONE TO HIM
RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
BUT THAT SHE HAD BEEN PERSISTENT IN CLINGING TO HIM
THE STREETS WERE HALF MUD AND HALF SNOW AND THE POOR WOMAN WHO HAD MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE SLUSH WAS SOILED AND WET
GRADUALLY SHE HAD LEARNED HOW FRIGHTFUL WAS THE THING SHE HAD DONE IN GIVING HERSELF TO A MAN OF WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN NOTHING AND IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT
WE'RE RUINED MISSUS LOPEZ AND IT'S YOUR HUSBAND HAS DONE IT WHEN WE WERE AT DOVERCOURT I TOLD YOU HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE HIS BUSINESS HAS LEFT HIM
AND NOW HE'S GOING TO KATTYMALY AT THIS MOMENT MISTER WHARTON KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE ROOM AS HE DID SO MISSUS PARKER GOT UP AND CURTSEYED
MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT BECOME LIKE THE MAN SHE HAD BECOME VULGAR SHE WAS NOT AN ELIGIBLE COMPANION FOR MISTER WHARTON'S DAUGHTER A MATTER AS TO WHICH THE FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HIMSELF PROPER OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE FACTS AN AUNT IN HIS CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SO GREAT A COMFORT TO HIM
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
HE WOULD HAVE DOUBLED HIS OFFER COULD HE THEREBY HAVE SECURED THE ANNIHILATION OF LOPEZ I WILL RAISE IT IF HE WILL GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE
HE HAD SEEN LOPEZ MORE THAN ONCE AND HAD ALSO SEEN MISTER HARTLEPOD MISTER HARTLEPOD HAD SIMPLY TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO REGISTER THE SHARES
MISSUS ROBY WAS PLEASED WITH LITTLE INTRIGUES WAS ADDICTED TO THE AMUSEMENT OF FOSTERING LOVE AFFAIRS WAS FOND OF BEING THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN SUCH MATTERS AND WAS NOT AVERSE TO HAVING PRESENTS GIVEN TO HER SHE HAD MARRIED A VULGAR MAN
THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
YOU WILL I AM SURE SAY NOTHING UNKIND TO A LADY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE PLACE SHE NOW FILLS BY MY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT LET US QUARREL ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN I WON'T QUARREL WITH YOU EVEN ABOUT A YOUNG ONE
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IN HEREFORDSHIRE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SHOULD SAY ANYTHING BUT IF THEY DID I SHOULDN'T MUCH CARE I SHOULD MY DEAR I SHOULD CARE VERY MUCH ONE IS BOUND TO THINK OF ONE'S FAMILY SUPPOSE IT SHOULD TURN OUT AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS
THIS IS MY FATHER MISSUS PARKER SAID EMILY PAPA THIS IS MISSUS PARKER SHE IS THE WIFE OF MISTER PARKER WHO WAS FERDINAND'S PARTNER
THAT HE DID LOVE THE GIRL AS WELL PERHAPS AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANY ONE BUT HE HAD FOUND OUT MANY PARTICULARS AS TO MISTER WHARTON'S MONEY BEFORE HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY HAD GATHERED UP HER KNITTING
IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
SHE BROODED OVER HER INJURY AND HIS HEART WAS SAD WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD VEXED HER LOVING HER AS HE DID WITH ALL HIS HEART BUT WITH A HEART THAT WAS NEVER DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY HE WAS MISERABLE
THAN ANYTHING THAT COULD FOLLOW MISSUS PARKER HAS BEEN HERE TO DAY SHE SAID TO HIM THAT NIGHT AND WHAT HAD MISSUS PARKER TO SAY THAT YOU HAD RUINED HER HUSBAND EXACTLY
YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT
AND YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THAT AS I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD MY JUDGMENT ABOUT A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE TRUSTED THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH MISS WHARTON WAS NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT
SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
DISREPUTABLE YOU MAY SAY THAT OF ANY MAN PAPA BUT WHEN A MAN HAS CONNEXIONS A FATHER AND MOTHER OR UNCLES AND AUNTS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEN THERE IS SOME GUARANTEE OF SECURITY
THE WOMAN IN THE DINING ROOM WAS MISSUS PARKER SHE HAD CALLED AT THE HOUSE AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE AND EMILY HAD AT ONCE COME DOWN WHEN SUMMONED BY TIDINGS
MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
AND LOPEZ HAS DONE IT ALL DONE IT ALL I HAVEN'T GOT A FATHER MA'AM WHO HAS GOT A HOUSE OVER HIS HEAD FOR ME AND MY BABIES ONLY THINK
AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
A MEANING TO A MAN'S WORDS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH ANOTHER TONE WOULD CONVEY OR IF HE DOES LIE IN DOING SO HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE LIES MISTER RATTLER HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD OFFICE AT THE TREASURY
BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
HE DIED MISSUS PARKER JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER HE WAS BORN DID HE NOW WELL WELL WE ALL HAVE OUR TROUBLES I SUPPOSE
OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
IT WOULD BE BETTER SO I COULD COME TO SEE YOU I DID TELL HIM TO GO IN MY PASSION I REPENTED OF IT INSTANTLY
FROM BEING WELL THAN I AM IS ANYTHING WRONG WRONG MA'AM EVERYTHING IS WRONG WHEN IS MISTER LOPEZ GOING TO PAY MY HUSBAND
THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
SHE SAYS YOU OWE HIM MONEY WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS IF SHE COMES AGAIN DO NOT SEE HER DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
NOT YET MY DEAR NOT YET WE WILL SEE AT THIS TIME LOPEZ DECLARED HIS PURPOSE ONE DAY OF DINING AT THE PROGRESS
AND MISTER WHARTON TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION TO REMAIN AT HOME WITH HIS DAUGHTER EVERETT WAS NOW EXPECTED AND THERE WAS A PROBABILITY THAT HE MIGHT COME ON
BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF INDECISION IN HER HUSBAND'S MANNER AND APPARENTLY SO LITTLE DONE BY HIM IN REGARD TO PERSONAL PREPARATION THAT SHE COULD HARDLY BRING HERSELF TO FEEL CERTAIN
I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GO TO BEDLAM AND NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT TO THE GRAND RELATIONS OF HIM WHO DID IT ALL HE IS A BAD MAN SAID MISTER WHARTON
INDEED THEN MISSUS LOPEZ I AM VERY FAR FROM WELL NO POOR WOMAN WHO IS THE MOTHER OF FIVE CHILDREN WAS EVER FARTHER
IT WILL BE A CRUSHING BLOW HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE IN HER COUNTENANCE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SIMILAR SIGNS YOU CLAIM A RIGHT TO MY OBEDIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
HE HAD THE POWER HE KNEW OF PUTTING AN END TO THE THING ALTOGETHER HE HAD ONLY TO SAY RESOLUTELY AND UNCHANGEABLY THAT THE THING SHOULDN'T BE AND IT WOULDN'T BE
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO RAISE YOUR OFFER MISTER WALKER HAD SAID TO MISTER WHARTON THAT WAS ALL VERY WELL MISTER WHARTON WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO RAISE HIS OFFER
WHEN A MAN SPECULATES AND DOESN'T WIN OF COURSE HE THROWS THE BLAME ON SOME ONE ELSE AND WHEN HE IS TOO MUCH OF A CUR TO COME HIMSELF HE SENDS HIS WIFE
SO THINGS WENT ON TILL THE END OF FEBRUARY HAD COME AND DURING ALL THIS TIME LOPEZ WAS STILL RESIDENT IN MISTER WHARTON'S HOUSE
SHE HAS ALWAYS BEHAVED WELL BOTH TO ME AND TO MY UNCLE SHE WAS AN ANGEL TO HIM
NOT IN THE CABINET NO NOT IN THE CABINET IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS USUAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT IS PROMOTION AND I AM GLAD POOR PHINEAS I HOPE THEY WON'T MURDER HIM OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
THEY ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO EACH OTHER AND NOW I HEAR THEY PASS THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE STEPS OF THE CARLTON AND REFORM CLUBS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO ONE MUST BE PATRONAGE SECRETARY NO DOUBT THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN IN THEIR WAY YOU KNOW
BUT MISSUS LOPEZ HAD AT ONCE GONE TO HER VISITOR OH MISSUS PARKER I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU I HOPE YOU ARE WELL
MANY OF THE CARES OF OFFICE THE PRIME MINISTER DID SUCCEED IN SHUFFLING OFF ALTOGETHER ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF HIS ELDER FRIEND HE WOULD NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF LADIES ABOUT WHOM HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING
HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
SAID THE BARRISTER MISSUS PARKER DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF ACCEPTING DIRECT CHARITY BUT NEVERTHELESS ON GOING AWAY DID TAKE THE FIVE SOVEREIGNS
SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
AND YOUR HUSBAND THINKS NO END OF HIMSELF AND WE'RE POOR PEOPLE SO IT DON'T MATTER WHETHER WE'RE ROBBED AND RUINED OR NOT THAT'S ABOUT IT IF I HAD ANYTHING
WHICH MISTER WHARTON OFFERED TO HER AFTER SUCH AN INTERVIEW AS THAT THE DINNER BETWEEN THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER WAS NOT VERY HAPPY SHE WAS EATEN UP BY REMORSE
AS THEY WILL DO IF YOU KNEW ME MISSUS PARKER YOU WOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT KNOW YOU OF COURSE I KNOW YOU YOU'RE A LADY AND YOUR FATHER'S A RICH MAN
ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY FROM DAY TO DAY HER FATHER WOULD ASK HER WHETHER SHE HAD MADE HER INTENDED PURCHASES AND SHE WOULD TELL HIM
THE END OF FEBRUARY HAD COME AND AS FAR AS MISSUS LOPEZ KNEW SHE WAS TO START FOR GUATEMALA IN A MONTH'S TIME AND YET
BECAUSE HE IS A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER WOULD YOU HAVE WISHED ME TO TELL HIM THAT HE MIGHT COME YES PAPA HE WAS SITTING ON A SOFA AND SHRANK BACK A LITTLE FROM HER AS SHE MADE THIS FREE AVOWAL
HE IS WHAT WE CALL AN ADVENTURER MARRIAGE MY DEAR IS A MOST SERIOUS THING YES PAPA I KNOW THAT ONE IS BOUND TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW CAN I GIVE YOU TO A MAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AN ADVENTURER
THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
DON'T YOU FEEL NO SHAME BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THINGS COMFORTABLE HERE I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL NOTHING TO YOU YOU DON'T CARE THOUGH MY CHILDREN WERE STARVING IN THE GUTTER
DO YOU THINK THAT HE WILL NOT GO I FEEL THAT I KNOW NOTHING PAPA YOU MUST NOT LET HIM STAY HERE ALWAYS YOU KNOW AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU
HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
MISTER LOPEZ SIR HAS RUINED US ROOT AND BRANCH ROOT AND BRANCH THAT AT ANY RATE IS NOT MY FAULT SAID MISTER WHARTON
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LOST YOU BUT WHAT DID MY TELLING MATTER TO HIM HE WAS VERY INDIGNANT AND YET HE IS STILL HERE
TO WHICH HE OBJECTED ONLY ON THE SCORE OF TIME YOU MUST EAT YOUR DINNER SOMEWHERE SHE SAID AND YOU NEED ONLY COME IN JUST BEFORE WE SIT DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR OWN ROOM IF YOU PLEASE WITHOUT COMING UPSTAIRS AT ALL I CAN AT ANY RATE DO THAT PART OF IT FOR YOU
TO LIVE OUT OF ENGLAND YES AT A PLACE THEY CALL I FORGET WHAT THEY CALL IT BUT I HEARD IT GUATEMALA
THAT IT WON'T COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY OFFICE TO EFFECT OR EVEN TO PROPOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN HER GRACE'S APPAREL BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU AND I CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHE MAY BE AN ANTIQUATED EVE FOR ME
HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
SHE IS NOT AT ANY RATE A FIT COMPANION FOR YOU IT WAS YOU WHO INTRODUCED ME TO HER HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT HER
PAPA SHE SAID TO HIM ONE DAY THIS IS THE CRUELLEST THING OF ALL WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM THAT HE MUST GO BECAUSE HE WOULD TAKE YOU WITH HIM
BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT IS HE AND WHY SHOULD NOT A FOREIGNER BE AS GOOD AS AN ENGLISHMAN HIS NAME IS FOREIGN BUT HE TALKS ENGLISH AND LIVES AS AN ENGLISHMAN HE HAS NO RELATIVES NO FAMILY NO BELONGINGS
FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
ALL THE MONEY HE HAS TOOK FROM HIM HAS HE TAKEN MONEY TAKEN HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING HE HAS SHORN MY HUSBAND AS BARE AS A BOARD
HAVEN'T YOU MISSUS LOPEZ OH DEAR EXCLAIMED THE SOFT HEARTED WOMAN REDUCED AT ONCE TO PITY HOW WAS IT THEN
BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
DO YOU THINK THAT I'D SIT AS YOU ARE SITTING I TELL YOU THAT LOPEZ HAS ROBBED US HAS ROBBED US AND TAKEN EVERYTHING WHAT CAN I SAY MISSUS PARKER
SHE HAS COME HERE WITH BAD NEWS VERY BAD NEWS INDEED SIR SAID MISSUS PARKER CURTSEYING AGAIN MISTER WHARTON FROWNED NOT AS BEING ANGRY WITH THE WOMAN
EVERYBODY WHO OWES ANYTHING TO ANYBODY SHOULD ALWAYS PAY IT THAT IS SO SELF EVIDENT THAT ONE WOULD ALMOST SUPPOSE THAT IT MIGHT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT BEING ENUNCIATED
HE HAD EXPRESSLY ASKED HER FOR HER SYMPATHY IN THE BUSINESS HE HAD ON HAND THEREBY GOING MUCH BEYOND HIS USUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER
SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
BUT FEELING THAT SOME FURTHER HORROR WAS TO BE TOLD HIM OF HIS SON IN LAW I CAN'T HELP COMING SIR CONTINUED MISSUS PARKER WHERE AM I TO GO IF I DON'T COME
OVER THERE HE COMES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS EVERY WEEK DOESN'T HE NOT QUITE THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL MISS HER IF SHE HAS TO STAY AWAY LONG I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE HER I DO LIKE HER
AND LET THAT BE AN END OF IT I LITTLE KNEW WHAT A WORLD OF TORMENT I WAS PREPARING FOR MYSELF
SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
HE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR A WORD BUT HE FELT THAT HE WOULD BE A TYRANT IF HE REFUSED IF YOU TELL ME THAT I AM NOT TO SEE HIM I SHALL NOT SEE HIM BUT I SHALL BE VERY UNHAPPY I DO LOVE HIM AND I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE SAME WAY
IF YOU WAS TURNED OUT INTO THE STREET WITH YOUR BABBY AS I AM LIKE TO BE I HAVE NO BABY SAID THE WRETCHED WOMAN THROUGH HER TEARS AND SOBS
WHETHER MARRIED OR SINGLE HE WOULD HAVE PREYED UPON MISTER PARKER TO THE SAME EXTENT
AND MISTER WHARTON HAD FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ABSTAIN FROM ALLUSION TO SUCH MATTERS FROM AN ASSURED FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT IN THAT DIRECTION PLANT AN ENDURING OBJECTION IN THIS WAY LOPEZ HAD CARRIED HIS POINT WITH MISTER WHARTON
THAT A LADY WANTED TO SEE HER SERVANTS HAVE A WAY OF ANNOUNCING A WOMAN AS A LADY WHICH CLEARLY EXPRESSES THEIR OWN OPINION THAT THE PERSON IN QUESTION IS NOT A LADY
BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
WHEN HE GOES I MUST GO WITH HIM WHY SHOULD YOU BE SACRIFICED ALSO I WILL TELL HIM THAT HE MUST LEAVE THE HOUSE I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM PAPA
YOU'RE RICH INDEED I AM NOT MISSUS PARKER YES YOU ARE YOU'RE LIVING HERE IN A GRAND HOUSE AND YOUR FATHER'S MADE OF MONEY
THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
WHEN GOING TO MISTER WHARTON AT HIS CHAMBERS HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO CHEAT THE LAWYER INTO ANY ERRONEOUS IDEA ABOUT HIS FAMILY
WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
WHAT CAN I DO WHERE IS HE HE IS NOT HERE HE IS DINING AT HIS CLUB WHERE IS THAT I WILL GO THERE AND SHAME HIM BEFORE THEM ALL
AND SWEPT FORWARD INTO THE HARBOUR WHAT BOAT IS THAT SAID ANNE IT SEEMS TO BE SOME FRIGATE LYING IN THE ROADS SAID BOB CARELESSLY AS HE BROUGHT ANNE ROUND WITH A GENTLE PRESSURE OF HIS ARM AND BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE HOMEWARD END OF THE TOWN
JOHN LEFT THE ROOM WHEN HE GAINED THE LOWER APARTMENT HIS FATHER WAS STANDING BY THE CHIMNEY PIECE THE SAILOR HAVING GONE THE TRUMPET MAJOR WENT UP TO THE FIRE AND GRASPING THE EDGE OF THE HIGH CHIMNEY SHELF STOOD SILENT
HE SAID TO HER IN A LOW VOICE OF REPRESSED RESENTMENT NO SAID ANNE WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO THE HALL AGAIN NEVER PERHAPS NONSENSE ANNE SAID MISSUS GARLAND
WHICH ILL BECAME HIM HE HAD YAWNED THOUGHT WISTFULLY OF THE OLD PEA JACKET AND THE WATERS OF THE DEEP BLUE SEA HIS DREAD OF DISPLEASING HIS FATHER BY SHOWING ANYTHING OF THIS CHANGE OF SENTIMENT WAS GREAT YET HE MIGHT HAVE BRAVED IT
HE'S GONE UP BY THE HOIST SAID THE SERGEANT RUNNING UP THE LADDER IN THE CORNER TO THE NEXT FLOOR AND ELEVATING THE LIGHT JUST IN TIME TO SEE BOB'S SUSPENDED FIGURE ASCENDING IN THE SAME WAY THROUGH THE SAME SORT OF
BUT FORTUNATELY THE DEADLOCK OF AWKWARD SUSPENSE INTO WHICH ALL FOUR HAD FALLEN WAS TERMINATED BY AN ACCIDENT A MESSENGER ENTERED THE KING'S BOX WITH DESPATCHES THERE WAS AN INSTANT PAUSE IN THE PERFORMANCE
MEANWHILE MISS JOHNSON HAVING FINISHED HER DUTIES FOR THAT EVENING RAPIDLY CHANGED HER DRESS AND WENT OUT LIKEWISE THE PROMINENT POSITION WHICH ANNE AND CAPTAIN BOB HAD OCCUPIED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE THEATRE
HE REMAINED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SPRING TILL THE SHADOWS HAD STRETCHED OUT EASTWARDS AND THE CHANCE OF OVERTAKING MATILDA HAD GROWN CONSIDERABLY LESS STILL
THEY LOOKED UP THE HOOK BY WHICH BOB HAD HELD ON HAD ASCENDED TO THE ROOF AND WAS WINDING ROUND THE CYLINDER NOTHING WAS VISIBLE ELSEWHERE BUT BOARDED DIVISIONS LIKE THE STALLS OF A STABLE ON EACH SIDE OF THE STAGE THEY STOOD UPON
WILL BE JUST AS USEFUL NOW AS IF I HAD MARRIED MYSELF POOR MATILDA BUT YOU WON'T EXPECT ME TO JOIN IN YOU HARDLY CAN I CAN SHEER OFF THAT DAY VERY EASILY YOU KNOW
YOU CAN GO AT ANY TIME AS USUAL LET HER COME WITH ME NOW MISSUS GARLAND I SHOULD BE PLEASED TO WALK ALONG WITH HER
UNDER THE APPLE TREE BUT SHE WAS NOT FACING IN HIS DIRECTION HE WALKED WITH A NOISIER TREAD
BUT FROM THE RATE THE COURTING IS SCUDDING ALONG AT I SHOULD SAY IT WON'T BE LONG FIRST IF YOU SEE HIM WHEN YOU GO BACK GIVE HIM MY BEST WISHES SHE LIGHTLY SAID AS SHE MOVED AWAY AND SHE ADDED WITH SOLEMN BITTERNESS
OF HIS EXPERIENCES IN CAMP IN QUARTERS IN FLANDERS AND ELSEWHERE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINE AND COLUMN OF FORCED MARCHES BILLETING AND SUCH LIKE TOGETHER WITH HIS HOPES OF PROMOTION ANNE LISTENED AT FIRST INDIFFERENTLY
AND TURNING THEY SAW THROUGH THE LEAVES THE NOSE AND FACE OF CRIPPLESTRAW THE WAGGON CONTAINED ALL DERRIMAN'S WORKPEOPLE IS YOUR MASTER HERE SAID JOHN NO TRUMPET MAJOR SIR BUT YOUNG MAISTER IS COMING TO FETCH US AT NINE O'CLOCK IN CASE WE SHOULD BE TOO BLIND TO DRIVE HOME
MATILDA DID NOT APPEAR IN THIS PIECE AND ANNE AGAIN INQUIRED IF THEY SHOULD GO HOME THIS TIME BOB AGREED AND TAKING HER UNDER HIS CARE WITH REDOUBLED AFFECTION TO MAKE UP FOR THE SPECIES OF COMA WHICH HAD SEIZED UPON HIS HEART FOR A TIME HE QUIETLY ACCOMPANIED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT I HAVE COME BACK AGAIN SHE MAY GO
TO DISTURB YE IN YOUR PRESENT FRAME OF MIND
SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE LIFE PARTICULARLY WELL IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE SCENE AND ONLY LONGED TO GET AWAY AND TO GET BOB AWAY WITH HER AT LAST THE CURTAIN FELL ON THE FINAL ACT AND THEN BEGAN THE FARCE OF NO SONG NO SUPPER
SO ONE AFTERNOON THEY WENT THE MILLER BEING ONE OF THE PARTY THE VILLAGERS WERE BY THIS TIME DRIVING A ROARING TRADE WITH THE SOLDIERS WHO PURCHASED OF THEM EVERY DESCRIPTION OF GARDEN PRODUCE MILK BUTTER AND EGGS AT LIBERAL PRICES
THE FOOTWAY AND THE OPEN ROAD CLOSE TO HER WHICH ILLUMINATED BY THE SLANTING MOON TO A GREAT BRIGHTNESS SPARKLED WITH MINUTE FACETS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALTS FROM THE WATER SPRINKLED THERE DURING THE DAY THE PROMENADERS AT THE FURTHER EDGE APPEARED IN DARK PROFILES
KNEW YOU WOULD TURN ROUND HE SAID HIS HOT ANGRY FACE INVADED BY A SMILE IN WHICH HIS TEETH SHOWED LIKE WHITE HEMMED IN BY RED AT CHESS WHAT DO YOU WANT MISTER DERRIMAN
A MESSAGE ARRIVED ASKING THEM TO ATTEND AT THE THEATRE ON THE COMING EVENING WITH THE ADDED REQUEST THAT THEY WOULD DRESS IN THEIR GAYEST CLOTHES TO DO JUSTICE TO THE PLACES TAKEN
AND EVEN THEN HAD A DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THEM IT BEING A KING'S NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SETTLED HE HIMSELF RETIRED TO AN OBSCURE PART OF THE PIT FROM WHICH THE STAGE WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE WE CAN SEE BEAUTIFULLY SAID BOB IN AN ARISTOCRATIC VOICE
SHALL WE GO DANCE THE ROUND YOUR SISTER IS LIVELY AT THE NEWS OBSERVED JIM CORNICK YES MURMURED JOHN GLOOMILY AS HE GNAWED HIS LOWER LIP AND KEPT HIS EYES FIXED ON THE FIRE WELL CONTINUED THE MAN FROM THE VICTORY
WERE CONDUCTED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND ON TO THE QUARTER WHERE THE SOLDIERS WIVES LIVED WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET LODGINGS IN THE COTTAGES NEAR THE MOST SHELTERED PLACE HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR THEM AND SNUG HUTS HAD BEEN BUILT FOR THEIR USE BY THEIR HUSBANDS
I DO NOT AND IF I DID I SHOULDN'T TELL NATURALLY I HEARD STEPS BEATING UP THE ROAD SIR SAID THE SERGEANT
SAID THE ASTONISHED MILLER BOB HAD INTENDED FOR MATILDA'S SAKE TO GIVE NO REASON TO A LIVING SOUL FOR HER DEPARTURE BUT HE COULD NOT TREAT HIS FATHER THUS RESERVEDLY
YOU KNOW MY TEMPER WHAT I SAY I MEAN HE SEATED HIMSELF FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE PLUCKED SOME LEAVES FROM THE HEDGE AND BEGAN HUMMING A SONG
OR IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED I HAVEN'T BEEN SO UPSET FOR YEARS NOR HAVE I
WE RATHER EXPECTED A LETTER FROM BOB BEFORE THIS WELL SAID JIM CORNICK WITH A SMILE OF TOLERATION YOU MUST MAKE ALLOWANCES THE TRUTH O'T IS HE'S ENGAGED JUST NOW AT PORTSMOUTH
THE KING HAD GONE FOR A CRUISE IN HIS YACHT AND THEY WOULD BE IN TIME TO SEE HIM LAND THEN DRUMS AND FIFES WERE HEARD AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO THEY SAW SERGEANT STANNER ADVANCING ALONG THE STREET WITH A FIRM COUNTENANCE
IT WAS A CLEAR DAY IN DECEMBER THE FIRST SLIGHT SNOW OF THE SEASON HAD BEEN SIFTED OVER THE EARTH AND ONE SIDE OF THE APPLE TREE BRANCHES IN THE MILLER'S GARDEN WAS TOUCHED WITH WHITE
MANY SUPPOSED THAT THAT NOBLE SHIP DISABLED BY THE BATTLE HAD GONE TO THE BOTTOM IN THE SUBSEQUENT TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER AND THE BELIEF WAS PERSEVERED IN TILL IT WAS TOLD IN THE TOWN AND PORT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN PASSING UP THE CHANNEL
GLORIOUS TRIUMPH AND SO ON AND THAT ALL THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE WILD TO KNOW PARTICULARS ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON JOHN ARRIVED WITH AUTHENTIC NEWS OF THE BATTLE OFF CAPE TRAFALGAR AND THE DEATH OF NELSON
WHY SAID BOB LEISURELY KNOCKING THE ASHES FROM THE PIPE HE HAD BEEN SMOKING THE PRESS GANG THEY HAVE COME BY GOD
KNOCKED TO PIECES YOU'D SAY SO IF SO BE YOU COULD SEE HER GAD HER SIDES BE BATTERED LIKE AN OLD PENNY PIECE THE SHOT BE STILL STICKING IN HER WALES AND HER SAILS BE LIKE SO MANY CLAP NETS
OF THE IRREGULAR BUILDING BEFORE HER THAN UPON THAT OCCUPIED BY HER MOTHER FOR SHE COULD NOT HELP EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE SOME ONE RUN OUT WITH A WILD FACE
AROSE PARTLY FROM HER NATURE WHICH WAS THE REVERSE OF MANAGING AND PARTLY FROM A NEW EMOTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH WHICH SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RECKON THE NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAD PRODUCED THE FRIENDSHIP OF ANNE FOR JOHN LOVEDAY
SHE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT WHEN A CERTAIN ONE OF THE SUBORDINATE LADIES OF THE COMEDY ENTERED ON THE STAGE THE TRUMPET MAJOR IN HIS CORNER NOT ONLY LOOKED CONSCIOUS BUT STARTED AND GAZED WITH PARTED LIPS THIS MUST BE THE ONE WHISPERED ANNE QUICKLY
AND THE GREY EXPANSE OF INTERVENING SEA
AND WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO CARRIED HIM TO THE COCKPIT AFTER THAT HE AND SOME OTHER LADS JUMPED ABOARD THE FRENCH SHIP AND I BELIEVE THEY WAS IN HER WHEN SHE STRUCK HER FLAG WHAT A DID NEXT I CAN'T SAY
CAME TO ME ONE NIGHT ABOUT THAT VERY WOMAN INSULTED ME BEFORE I COULD PUT MYSELF ON MY GUARD AND RAN AWAY BEFORE I COULD COME UP WITH HIM AND AVENGE MYSELF THE WOMAN TRICKS ME AT EVERY TURN I WANT TO PART EM THEN WHY DON'T YOU THERE'S A SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY
CONCERNING NELSON AND HIS BLOCKADING SQUADRON OFF CADIZ THERE WERE THE CUSTOMARY BAD JOKES ABOUT BUONAPARTE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT THE WHOLE FRENCH ARMY HAD TURNED ITS BACK UPON BOULOGNE AND SET OUT FOR THE RHINE
THE PIECE OF GOLD SPUN IN THE AIR AND CAME DOWN HEADS NO I WON'T GO AFTER ALL HE SAID
WHEN ANNE AND BOB ENTERED THE THEATRE THEY FOUND THAT JOHN HAD TAKEN EXCELLENT PLACES AND CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD GOT THEM FOR NOTHING THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE LADY OF HIS CHOICE AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD PAID FULL PRICES FOR THOSE TWO SEATS LIKE ANY OTHER OUTSIDER
IN SPITE OF THE RISE IN HER FORTUNES MISS JOHNSON STILL REMEMBERED AND ALWAYS WOULD REMEMBER HER HUMILIATING DEPARTURE FROM OVERCOMBE AND IT HAD BEEN TO HER EVEN A MORE GRIEVOUS THING THAT BOB HAD ACQUIESCED IN HIS BROTHER'S RULING THAN THAT JOHN HAD DETERMINED IT
LOVEDAY THEN BUSTLED OFF TO DRAW THE VISITOR SOMETHING TO DRINK ANNE GARLAND WITH A GLOWING BLUSH ON HER FACE HAD GONE TO THE BACK PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF SWEET CONTENT AS SHE SLIGHTLY SWAYED HERSELF WITHOUT SPEAKING
THE TRUMPET MAJOR THOUGH NOT PROMINENTLY SEATED HAD BEEN SEEN BY MATILDA ALREADY WHO HAD OBSERVED STILL MORE PLAINLY HER OLD BETROTHED AND ANNE IN THE OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE JOHN WAS NOT CONCERNED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AT
AND THAT MANY OF THE PRIZES HAD BEEN LOST ANNE SAID LITTLE TO ALL THESE THINGS AND PRESERVED A SUPERSTRATUM OF CALMNESS ON HER COUNTENANCE BUT SOME INNER VOICE SEEMED TO WHISPER TO HER THAT BOB WAS NO MORE
COME WHAT JABBER IS THIS GOING ON SAID THE LIEUTENANT STEPPING FORWARD BRING YOUR MAN
FELL AS UNEXPECTEDLY AS THUNDERBOLTS AT THIS CRITICAL TIME OF OUR HISTORY THE KING AT LENGTH BECKONED TO LORD WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM THE PLAY WAS AGAIN STOPPED AND THE CONTENTS OF THE DESPATCH WERE PUBLICLY COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIENCE
JOHN JOHN NOT TOO FAST SAID THE MILLER THAT'S A HARD THING TO SAY OF YOUR BROTHER AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF IT WELL HE TRIES ME MORE THAN I CAN BEAR GOOD GOD WHAT CAN A MAN BE MADE OF TO GO ON AS HE DOES
HE MOVED TO TURN OFF THE LIGHT BUT BEFORE HE HAD DONE SO IT FLASHED OVER THE FORMS OF THE SPEAKERS AND REVEALED A SERGEANT A NAVAL OFFICER AND A FILE OF MARINES ANNE WAITED TO SEE NO MORE WHEN BOB STAYED UP TO GRIND AS HE WAS DOING TO NIGHT
AS THERE WAS YET SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THE THEATRE WOULD OPEN
IT IS HE IS SO CHARMED WITH THE LIGHT OF THAT CORNER CANDLE FALLS RIGHT UPON HIS CHEEK BY THIS TIME THE KING HAD APPEARED IN HIS PLACE WHICH WAS OVERHUNG BY A CANOPY OF CRIMSON SATIN FRINGED WITH GOLD
LIKE A GOOD MANY OF THE REST FROM OUR SHIP
THE CAP'N HAD A NARROW ESCAPE LIKE MANY O THE REST A SHOT SHAVED HIS ANKLE LIKE A RAZOR YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT MAN'S FACE IN THE HET O BATTLE HIS FEATURES WERE AS IF THEY'D BEEN CAST IN STEEL
SHE FURTHER RECALLED THE STRANGE AGITATION OF MISS JOHNSON ON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND THAT IT OCCURRED JUST AT THE ENTRY OF THE DRAGOON
LIGHTS NEARER AT HAND THEY CAN'T MAKE YOU GO NOW YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN TRADESMAN CAN THEY SHE ASKED
AND NO HARM WILL BE DONE
WELL WHERE'S MISTER LOVEDAY ASKED MISSUS GARLAND FATHER'S BEHIND SAID JOHN MISSUS GARLAND LOOKED BEHIND HER SOLICITOUSLY AND THE MILLER WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THE EVENT BECKONED TO HER
AT LENGTH HE WAS SO BALANCED BETWEEN THE IMPULSE TO GO ON AND THE IMPULSE TO GO BACK THAT A PUFF OF WIND EITHER WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL NIGH SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE FOR HIM
DID I HEAR A NOISE WHEN I WENT OUT ASKED THE ELDER IN A TONE OF MISGIVING YES YOU DID SAID JOHN IT WAS SHE BUT HER MOTHER SAYS SHE IS BETTER NOW FATHER HE ADDED IMPETUOUSLY
AFORE THE PIES AND CAKES GET MOULDY AND THE BLACKPOT STALE
HE COULD HARDLY BRING HIMSELF TO DO OTHERWISE THAN FOLLOW ON THE ROAD AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED THIS STRIFE OF THOUGHT WAS SO WELL MAINTAINED THAT SITTING AND STANDING
ALONG STRAIGHT AND QUIET AND BE VERY BUSY IN THE MILL ALL TO MORROW MISTER LOVEDAY THEY DROVE AWAY AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT ONWARD OUT OF THE TOWN ANNE STRAINED HER EYES WISTFULLY TOWARDS PORTLAND
THESE COMPARTMENTS BEING MORE OR LESS HEAPED UP WITH WHEAT AND BARLEY IN THE GRAIN PERHAPS HE'S BURIED HIMSELF IN THE CORN THE WHOLE CREW JUMPED INTO THE CORN BINS AND STIRRED ABOUT THEIR YELLOW CONTENTS BUT NEITHER ARM LEG NOR COAT TAIL WAS UNCOVERED
ANNE SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID DESCENDED THE LADDER AND RAN TO THE BACK DOOR HASTILY UNBOLTING IT TO SAVE BOB'S TIME AND GENTLY OPENING IT IN READINESS FOR HIM SHE HAD NO SOONER DONE THIS THAN SHE FELT HANDS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER FROM WITHOUT AND A VOICE EXCLAIMING
BUT OF INTENSE PREOCCUPATION PRESENTLY LOVEDAY THE FATHER CAME TO THE DOOR HER MOTHER VANISHED WITH HIM AND THEY REMAINED CLOSETED TOGETHER A LONG TIME
HE DID NOT POSITIVELY GO TOWARDS HOME AT LAST HE TOOK A GUINEA FROM HIS POCKET AND RESOLVED TO PUT THE QUESTION TO THE HAZARD HEADS I GO TAILS I DON'T
BUT CAN IT BE THAT MY STORY HURTS YE
THE SECOND TRAP ALSO FELL TOGETHER BEHIND HIM AND HE WAS LOST TO VIEW AS BEFORE IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW NOW THERE WAS ONLY A FLIMSY LITTLE LADDER AND THE MEN ASCENDED CAUTIOUSLY WHEN THEY STEPPED OUT UPON THE LOFT IT WAS EMPTY
SAY THAT I AM GLAD TO HEAR HE IS MAKING SUCH GOOD USE OF THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS ESCAPE FROM THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH SHE WENT AWAY EXPRESSING INDIFFERENCE BY AUDIBLY SINGING IN THE DISTANCE
THAT THE MILL BOY COULD WALK ALONG THE TOP WITHOUT SINKING IN A FEAT WHICH HE OFTEN PERFORMED AS A MEANS OF FILLING OUT HIS DAY'S WORK THE SOIL WITHIN WAS OF THAT INTENSE FAT BLACKNESS
LEFT HER NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO SUPPOSE THAT THE SITUATION WAS ARRANGED BY BOB AS A SPECIES OF DEFIANCE TO HERSELF AND HER HEART SUCH AS IT WAS BECAME PROPORTIONATELY EMBITTERED AGAINST HIM
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO BE MARRIED I DON'T KNOW AS HOW THE DAY IS SETTLED ANSWERED JIM EVEN NOW SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE DEVASTATION HE WAS CAUSING IN ONE FAIR BREAST
I HAVE OFTEN SAID I OUGHT TO VOLUNTEER AND NOT CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL IT IS JUST THAT THAT KEEPS ME AT HOME I WON'T LEAVE YOU IF I CAN HELP IT IT CANNOT MAKE SUCH A VAST DIFFERENCE TO THE COUNTRY WHETHER ONE MAN GOES OR STAYS
THROUGH STICKING SO CLOSELY TO BUSINESS THAT DAY WELL JOHN BOB HAS TOLD YOU ALL OF COURSE A QUEER
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS THIS I'VE HIT UPON A PLAN TO GET OUT OF THE AWKWARD CORNER SHE HAS PUT US IN WHAT YOU'LL THINK OF IT I CAN'T SAY DAVID HAS JUST GIVEN ME THE HEADS
BY DEGREES AS HE REFLECTED FIRST ON JOHN'S VIEW AND THEN ON HIS OWN
AND WHEN THE BELLES WERE ALL ALLOTTED THOSE WHO SCARCELY DESERVED THAT TITLE HAD THEIR TURN MANY OF THE SOLDIERS BEING NOT AT ALL PARTICULAR ABOUT HALF AN INCH OF NOSE MORE OR LESS A TRIFLING DEFICIENCY OF TEETH OR A LARGER CROP OF FRECKLES
NOW COME BOB
MAY I ASK WHY YOU SAID IN SUCH A QUEER WAY THAT YOU LOVED THAT COUPLE IN A QUEER WAY WELL AS IF YOU HATED THEM I DON'T MIND YOUR KNOWING THAT I HAVE GOOD REASON TO HATE THEM YOU DO TOO IT SEEMS THAT MAN SAID FESTUS SAVAGELY
ESPECIALLY SUCH AS CONTAINED ANY FRAGMENT OF SHIPPING NEWS THIS THREW THEM MUCH TOGETHER AND AT THESE TIMES JOHN WAS OFTEN AWKWARD AND CONFUSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNWONTED STRESS OF CONCEALING HIS GREAT LOVE FOR HER
AS HE TOOK A DELICATE PINCH OF SNUFF AND DREW OUT THE MAGNIFICENT POCKET HANDKERCHIEF BROUGHT HOME FROM THE EAST FOR SUCH OCCASIONS BUT I AM AFRAID POOR JOHN CAN'T SEE AT ALL BUT WE CAN SEE HIM REPLIED ANNE AND NOTICE BY HIS FACE WHICH OF THEM
WHEN THE ELDER WOULD RISE AND BOB WITHDRAW TO BED A FREQUENT ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THEM SINCE BOB HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRINDER HAVING REACHED THE PRIVACY OF HER OWN ROOM ANNE THREW OPEN THE WINDOW FOR SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF GOING TO BED JUST YET
BOB IS A WORTHLESS BLOCKHEAD
AS SHE DID NOT TURN HE WENT ON
MIDNIGHT VISITORS MISS GARLAND AND LOVEDAY WALKED LEISURELY TO THE INN AND CALLED FOR HORSE AND GIG WHILE THE HOSTLER WAS BRINGING IT ROUND THE LANDLORD WHO KNEW BOB AND HIS FAMILY WELL SPOKE TO HIM QUIETLY IN THE PASSAGE
AND THEY TALKED FROM PLOT TO PLOT WITH A ZEST AND ANIMATION WHICH MISSUS GARLAND COULD NEVER HAVE ANTICIPATED WHEN SHE FIRST REMOVED THITHER AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
HE TURNED ASIDE TO THE GARDEN AND WALKED DOWN THAT PLEASANT ENCLOSURE TO LEARN IF HE WERE LIKELY TO FIND IN THE OTHER HALF OF IT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SO WELL YES THERE SHE WAS
SO HIS EPAULETTES AND BLUE JACKET AND ANNE'S YELLOW GIPSY HAT WERE OFTEN SEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GARDEN AT THE SAME TIME BUT HE NEVER INTRUDED INTO HER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE NOR DID SHE INTO LOVEDAY'S
I WISH YOU HAD NOT TOLD SAID MATILDA TEARFULLY SHE'S THE WORST DASH MY EYES NOW LISTEN TO THAT WHY YOU CHICKEN HEARTED OLD STAGER YOU WAS AS WELL AGREED AS I COME NOW HASN'T HE USED YOU BADLY
YOU MAY AS WELL COME DOWN OLD BOY TWAS A SPRY JUMP AND WE GIVE YE CREDIT FOR T THE LATTER MOVEMENT OF LOVEDAY HAD BEEN A MERE FEINT PARTLY HIDDEN BY THE LEAVES HE GLIDED BACK TO THE OTHER PART OF THE TREE FROM WHENCE IT WAS EASY TO JUMP UPON A THATCH COVERED OUT HOUSE
WHEN HER EXCURSIONS BECAME RESTRICTED TO HER OWN PREMISES AND IN A SPOT OF THE GARDEN NOT FAR REMOVED THE TRUMPET MAJOR LOVED TO LINGER ALSO HAVING BY VIRTUE OF HIS OFFICE NO STABLE DUTY TO PERFORM
AS YOU MUST COME WILLY NILLY YOU'LL DO THE FIRST IF YOU'VE ANY BRAINS WHATEVER BOB'S TEMPER BEGAN TO RISE DON'T YOU TALK SO LARGE ABOUT YOUR PINIONING MY MAN WHEN I'VE SETTLED NOW OR NEVER YOUNG BLOW HARD INTERRUPTED HIS INFORMANT
PUTTING ON THE LOOK OF A GOOD WOMAN BUT I HAVE REASONED IT OUT AND AT LAST THANK GOD I HAVE GOT OVER MY AMBITION THE LOVEDAYS ARE OUR TRUE AND ONLY FRIENDS AND MISTER FESTUS DERRIMAN WITH ALL HIS MONEY
AND SPRING ACROSS INTO THE APPLE TREE GROWING WITHOUT HE ALIGHTED WITHOUT MUCH HURT BEYOND A FEW SCRATCHES FROM THE BOUGHS A SHOWER OF FALLING APPLES TESTIFYING TO THE FORCE OF HIS LEAP
UPON MY LIFE HE SAID SO HOW CAN YOU DO IT MISS GARLAND WHEN I WHO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY UP ALL THE LOVEDAYS WOULD GLADLY COME TO TERMS WITH YE WHAT
THEY BREATHED RATHER THAN SPOKE THEIR THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF THE MILLER'S EYES BEING MOIST AS HE TURNED ASIDE TO CALM HIMSELF WHILE ANNE HAVING FIRST JUMPED UP WILDLY FROM HER SEAT SANK BACK AGAIN
HE CAME DOWN FROM THE CAMP TO THE MILL ALMOST EVERY DAY AND ANNE FINDING THAT HE ADROITLY WALKED AND SAT IN HIS FATHER'S PORTION OF THE GARDEN WHENEVER SHE DID SO IN THE OTHER HALF COULD NOT HELP SMILING AND SPEAKING TO HIM
I DO LOVEDAY THE ELDER REMAINED THINKING AWHILE AND THEN WENT ON
AND DO IT HURT YOUR FEELINGS MY SON AT SUCH A TIME NO I'LL BRING MYSELF TO BEAR IT ANYHOW WHY SHOULD I OBJECT TO OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS BECAUSE I HAVE LOST MY OWN
POOR MATILDA MURMURED BOB THERE I WAS AFRAID TWOULD HURT THY FEELINGS SAID THE MILLER WITH SELF REPROACH MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THY WEDDING AND USING THEM FOR MY OWN
GOOD AFTERNOON TRUMPET MAJOR IN A GLACIAL MANNER UNUSUAL WITH HER WALKED AWAY TO ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN LOVEDAY
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU MEANT TO AND TIS WISE OF YE
O NO LET US SEE HOW SHE FLEETS HERSELF OFF THAT BIT OF A SCRAPE SHE'S PLAYING AT NOW WELL WHAT A HAND SHE IS AT IT TO BE SURE ANNE SAID NO MORE BUT WAITED ON SUPREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALMOST TEARFUL
AND A LOW UNCONSCIOUS HUMMING CAME FROM ANNE IN HER DISTANT CORNER THE FAINT MELODY CONTINUED MORE OR LESS WHEN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE LOVEDAYS WAS RENEWED WE HEARD AFORE THAT THE VICTORY WAS NEAR KNOCKED TO PIECES SAID THE MILLER
BUT FESTUS HAD ALREADY SAID ROBERT LOVEDAY SON OF THE MILLER AT OVERCOMBE YOU MAY FIND SEVERAL LIKELY FELLOWS IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
HIS WINDOW FACED TOWARDS THE GARDEN AND HENCE THE LIGHT COULD NOT AS YET HAVE BEEN SEEN BY THE PRESS GANG BOB DEAR BOB SHE SAID THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
WITH HER RAMBLE IN SEARCH OF MATILDA SAT SILENT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
BEING FACE TO FACE WITH HER BUT AT THE EXTRAORDINARY SUSPICION THAT THIS CONJUNCTURE MUST REVIVE IN THE MINDS OF HIS BEST BELOVED FRIENDS AFTER SOME MOMENTS OF PAINED REFLECTION HE TAPPED HIS KNEE GAD I WON'T EXPLAIN IT SHALL GO AS IT IS
THEY FOUND HER LYING INSENSIBLE UPON THE FLOOR THE TRUMPET MAJOR HIS LIPS TIGHTLY CLOSED LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS AND LAID HER UPON THE BED AFTER WHICH HE WENT BACK TO THE DOOR TO GIVE ROOM TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS BENDING OVER THE GIRL WITH SOME HARTSHORN
BUT WHAT IT WAS I DON'T KNOW FOR I WAS QUARTERED AT A GUN SOME WAYS OFF
SEE HE IS AGITATED SHE TURNED TO BOB BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT HIS HAND CONVULSIVELY CLOSED UPON HERS AS HE TOO STRANGELY FIXED HIS EYES UPON THE NEWLY ENTERED LADY WHAT IS IT
NO SAID BOB HEROICALLY IT SHALL NOT IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT IN MY SORROW TO FEEL THAT THE SPLENDID GRUB AND THE ALE AND YOUR STUNNING NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES AND
WHICH ETERNALLY SHATTERED THE ENEMY'S FORCE BY SEA FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE AUSTRIAN NEWS CORPORAL TULLIDGE RAN INTO THE MILLER'S HOUSE TO INFORM HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS MONDAY AT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING
SHE ALWAYS SPOKE TO HIM WHEN SHE SAW HIM THERE AND HE REPLIED IN DEEP FIRM ACCENTS ACROSS THE GOOSEBERRY BUSHES OR THROUGH THE TALL ROWS OF FLOWERING PEAS AS THE CASE MIGHT BE HE THUS GAVE HER ACCOUNTS AT FIFTEEN PACES
CAPTAIN HARDY WAS ALIVE THOUGH HIS ESCAPE HAD BEEN NARROW ENOUGH HIS SHOE BUCKLE HAVING BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY A SHOT IT WAS FEARED THAT THE VICTORY HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE HEAVIEST SLAUGHTER AMONG ALL THE SHIPS ENGAGED
THE CHAP HEV DONE HIS DUTY AS A SAILOR AND THOUGH THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BETWEEN HIM AND ANNE HER MOTHER IN TALKING IT OVER WITH ME HAS SAID MANY TIMES THAT SHE COULDN'T THINK OF THEIR MARRYING
DEPEND UPON IT HE SAID THEY WON'T KNOW YOU WILL THEY BOB SAID ANNE ANXIOUSLY THEY CERTAINLY WON'T KNOW HIM FOR A SEAMAN NOW REMARKED THE LANDLORD LAUGHING AND AGAIN SURVEYING BOB UP AND DOWN BUT IF I WAS YOU TWO I SHOULD DRIVE HOME
THEY REMOVED SACKS PEEPED AMONG THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF BUT TO NO PURPOSE THE LIEUTENANT BEGAN TO FUME AT THE LOSS OF TIME WHAT CURSED FOOLS TO LET THE MAN GO WHY LOOK HERE WHAT'S THIS HE HAD OPENED THE DOOR BY WHICH SACKS WERE TAKEN IN FROM WAGGONS WITHOUT
THE BROOKS WERE SO FAR OVERHUNG AT THEIR BRINKS BY GRASS AND GARDEN PRODUCE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR PERPETUAL BABBLING FEW WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE THERE THIS WAS WHERE ANNE LIKED BEST TO LINGER
AND NOT MIND US AT ALL BOB PUT A PERIOD TO HER SPEECH BY A MARK OF AFFECTION TO WHICH HISTORY AFFORDS MANY PARALLELS IN EVERY AGE SHE SAID NO MORE ABOUT THE BLACK DIAMOND BUT WHENEVER THEY ASCENDED A HILL SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK AT THE LIGHTS IN PORTLAND ROADS
THE FOREMOST PURSUERS ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO SEE CAPTAIN BOB'S LEGS AND SHOE BUCKLES VANISHING THROUGH THE TRAP DOOR IN THE JOISTS OVERHEAD HIS PERSON HAVING BEEN WHIRLED UP BY THE MACHINERY LIKE ANY BAG OF FLOUR AND THE TRAP FALLING TO BEHIND HIM
HER INTERESTS HAD GRANDLY DEVELOPED FROM THE LIMITS OF OVERCOMBE AND THE TOWN LIFE HARD BY TO AN EXTENSIVENESS TRULY EUROPEAN DURING THE WHOLE MONTH OF OCTOBER HOWEVER NOT A SINGLE GRAIN OF INFORMATION REACHED HER OR ANYBODY ELSE
SAID BOB WITH SAINTLY SELF SACRIFICE IN HIS AIR WELL SAID ANSWERED THE MILLER HEARTILY
BOB REPLIED GRAVELY THROWING DOWN HIS BUNDLE AND STICK MATILDA I FIND HAS NOT GONE AWAY IN SCORN OF US SHE HAS GONE AWAY FOR OTHER REASONS
AND BOB LOVEDAY AS HE SAT THERE AND HEARD IT HAD VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION HOW IT WOULD BEAR UPON HIS DESTINY THIS PARENTHETIC EXCITEMENT DIVERTED FOR A FEW MINUTES THE EYES OF BOB AND ANNE FROM THE TRUMPET MAJOR AND WHEN THE PLAY PROCEEDED AND THEY LOOKED BACK TO HIS CORNER HE WAS GONE
BITTERLY CRIED BOB IN A TONE OF FAR HIGHER THOUGHT HOW YOU DISAPPOINT ME AND HE WENT SLOWLY TOWARDS THE HOUSE HIS FATHER APPEARED IN THE OPENING OF THE MILL DOOR
FOR THE RENCOUNTER WITH FESTUS HAD DAMPED THE SPIRITS OF BOTH AT LAST THE WIDOW'S PRIVATE TALK WITH MILLER LOVEDAY CAME TO AN END AND SHE HASTENED ONWARD THE MILLER GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION TO MEET A MAN ON BUSINESS
AND TO LOOK INTO A LITTLE DRAWER AT SOMETHING SOFT AND BROWN THAT LAY IN A CURL THERE WRAPPED IN PAPER AT LAST SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS
BUT THOUGH APART FROM ANNE HE WAS NOT AVERSE TO SEAFARING IN ITSELF TO BE SMUGGLED THITHER BY THE MACHINERY OF A PRESS GANG WAS INTOLERABLE AND THE PROCESS OF SEIZING STUNNING PINIONING AND CARRYING OFF UNWILLING HANDS
ONLY ABOARD THE BLACK DIAMOND IF YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE THE BOUNTY AND COME VOLUNTARILY YOU'LL BE ALLOWED TO GO ASHORE WHENEVER YOUR SHIP'S IN PORT IF YOU DON'T AND WE'VE GOT TO PINION YE
NOW SHE WOULD NOT TURN AT LAST IN HIS FOND ANXIETY HE DID WHAT HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE WITHOUT AN INVITATION AND
WAS THE OFFICE FOR THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD AT SEA BEGINNING WE THEREFORE COMMIT HIS BODY TO THE DEEP IN THESE FIRST DAYS OF DECEMBER SEVERAL OF THE VICTORIOUS FLEET CAME INTO PORT BUT NOT THE VICTORY
MOREOVER THE NUMEROUS SOLDIERS REGULAR AND OTHERWISE THAT HAUNTED OVERCOMBE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE GETTING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE VILLAGERS AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS STANDING AT GARDEN GATES WALKING IN THE ORCHARDS
YARDS AND YARDS OF MUSLIN WOUND ROUND HIS NECK FORMING A SORT OF ASYLUM FOR THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE TWO FANCY WAISTCOATS AND COAT BUTTONS LIKE CIRCULAR SHAVING GLASSES THE ABSURD EXTREME OF FEMALE FASHION WHICH WAS TO WEAR MUSLIN DRESSES IN JANUARY
ANNE HAD STARTED AS IF SHAKEN BY AN INVISIBLE HAND AND A THICK MIST OF DOUBT SEEMED TO OBSCURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF HER EYES THIS WAS BUT FOR TWO OR THREE MOMENTS VERY PALE SHE AROSE AND WENT RIGHT UP TO THE SEAMAN
HE SAID LET THEM THINK HER MINE
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE'S IN THE HOUSE HE MAY BE AND HE MAY NOT
A VERY NICE YOUNG MASTER BAKER'S DAUGHTER HONEY A VERY WISE CHOICE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S IS SHE FAIR OR DARK HER HAIR IS RATHER LIGHT I LIKE LIGHT HAIR AND HER NAME
AND AS THE WEATHER GREW HOTTER KICKED UP THEIR HEELS AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS FURIOUSLY UNDER THE MADDENING STING OF THE DUN FLY THE GREEN LEAVES IN THE GARDEN BECAME OF A DARKER DYE THE GOOSEBERRIES RIPENED
SAID SHE WHAT DO YOU WANT MISTER DERRIMAN NOW LISTEN TO THAT IS THAT MY ENCOURAGEMENT
TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE SURMISE ON THE CAUSE OF MISS JOHNSON'S DISAPPEARANCE THAT THE HUMAN MIND COULD FRAME TO WHICH ANNE RETURNED MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS THE RESULT NOT OF INDIFFERENCE
THEN LETTERS FROM SURVIVORS BEGAN TO APPEAR IN THE PUBLIC PRINTS WHICH JOHN SO REGULARLY BROUGHT TO ANNE BUT THOUGH HE WATCHED THE MAILS WITH UNCEASING VIGILANCE THERE WAS NEVER A LETTER FROM BOB
WAS SLOWLY EFFECTING A WARMER LIKING BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HIS FATHER THUS THE MONTH OF JULY PASSED THE TROOP HORSES CAME WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK TWICE A DAY DOWN TO DRINK UNDER HER WINDOW
FOR THE WIND HAD DROPPED AND THE SMOKE WAS LIKE A CLOUD BUT A GOT A GOOD DEAL TALKED ABOUT AND THEY SAY THERE'S PROMOTION IN STORE FOR'N AT THIS POINT IN THE STORY JIM CORNICK STOPPED TO DRINK
JOHN GENTLY TRIED TO INTERCEPT HER BUT SHE PASSED HIM BY DO YOU SPEAK OF ROBERT LOVEDAY AS COURTING A WIFE SHE ASKED WITHOUT THE LEAST BETRAYAL OF EMOTION I DIDN'T SEE YOU MISS REPLIED CORNICK TURNING
DON'T MENTION HIM MOTHER DON'T WELL THEN DEAR WALK IN THE GARDEN SO POOR ANNE WHO REALLY HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO THROW HER HEART AWAY UPON A SOLDIER
WHO WOULD AVOID NEEDLESS EXPOSURE AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE VICTORY'S CREW HAD BEEN DISABLED OR SLAIN ANYBODY WHO HAD LOOKED INTO HER ROOM AT THIS TIME
LITTLE KNEW THE SHREWD HABITS OF THE GENTLEMEN SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH WHO WELL USED TO THIS SORT OF PASTIME HAD ALREADY POSTED THEMSELVES AT EVERY OUTLET FROM THE PREMISES BRING THE LANTERN SHOUTED THE FELLOW WHO HELD HER
AND THAT THE PERSONS SEEN BY FARMER DERRIMAN OF WHOSE VISIT AND RECLAMATION OF HIS BOX THE MILLER HAD TOLD HER MIGHT HAVE BEEN MATILDA AND JOHN LOVEDAY
BUT HIS FATHER HAS MADE MONEY AND KEEPS HIM AT HOME FAITH NOW YOU TELL OF IT THERE'S A HINT OF SEA LEGS ABOUT HIM WHAT'S THE YOUNG BEAU'S NAME DON'T TELL WHISPERED MATILDA
HE'S HERE HE'S HERE THE MEN EXCLAIMED RUNNING BACK FROM THE TREE BY THIS TIME THEY HAD OBTAINED ANOTHER LIGHT AND PURSUED HIM CLOSELY ALONG THE BACK QUARTERS OF THE MILL
WHILE THEY WERE PAUSING TO DECIDE WHICH COURSE TO TAKE ONE OF THE SOLDIERS HELD UP THE LIGHT A BLACK OBJECT WAS DISCERNIBLE UPON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM AND THEY FOUND IT TO BE A HAT THE HAT OF BOB LOVEDAY WE ARE ON THE TRACK CRIED THE SERGEANT DECIDING FOR THIS DIRECTION
BUT KNOWING NO ONE ELSE SO GOOD NATURED AND EXPERIENCED SHE GREW INTERESTED IN HIM AS IN A BROTHER BY DEGREES HIS GOLD LACE BUCKLES AND SPURS LOST ALL THEIR STRANGENESS AND WERE AS FAMILIAR TO HER AS HER OWN CLOTHES
HE GAVE A STERN SUPPRESSED NOD OF FRIENDSHIP TO OUR PEOPLE AND PASSED BY NEXT THEY CAME UP TO A WAGGON BOWERED OVER WITH LEAVES AND FLOWERS SO THAT THE MEN INSIDE COULD HARDLY BE SEEN COME TO SEE THE KING HIP HIP HURRAH CRIED A VOICE WITHIN
AS HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP WITH A GIRL WITHOUT A SINGLE COPPER NAIL TO BE SURE THERE WAS A TIME WE HAD WHEN WE GOT INTO PORT IT WAS OPEN HOUSE FOR US ALL AND AFTER MENTALLY REGARDING THE SCENE FOR A FEW SECONDS JIM EMPTIED HIS CUP AND ROSE TO GO
I HALF THOUGHT SO HERE IS A WAY IN HE CONTINUED TO HIS COMRADES HASTENING TO THE FOOT OF THE LADDER WHICH LED TO BOB'S ROOM WHAT D'YE WANT SAID BOB QUIETLY OPENING THE DOOR AND SHOWING HIMSELF STILL RADIANT IN THE FULL DRESS THAT HE HAD WORN WITH SUCH EFFECT AT THE THEATRE ROYAL
OR EVEN NOTICING THAT SUCH AN ENTRANCE EXISTED IN THIS AGAIN SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THEY CROSSED INTO THE FRONT WITHOUT A PAUSE THE PULSATIONS OF HER HEART BECAME A TURMOIL NOW
AND AFTER STABLING THE HORSE THEY ENTERED THE TOWN TOGETHER THE TRUMPET MAJOR INFORMING THEM THAT THE WATERING PLACE HAD NEVER BEEN SO FULL BEFORE THAT THE COURT THE PRINCE OF WALES AND EVERYBODY OF CONSEQUENCE WAS THERE AND THAT AN ATTIC COULD SCARCELY BE GOT FOR MONEY
I'LL OVERTAKE YOU IN A MINUTE SHE SAID TO THE YOUNGER PAIR AND WENT BACK
TURNED INTO THE INNER GARDEN FROM DAY TO DAY AND PASSED A GOOD MANY HOURS THERE THE PLEASANT BIRDS SINGING TO HER AND THE DELIGHTFUL BUTTERFLIES ALIGHTING ON HER HAT AND THE HORRID ANTS RUNNING UP HER STOCKINGS
ABOUT TWENTY PLACES WERE OCCUPIED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY AND SUITE AND BEYOND THEM WAS A CROWD OF POWDERED AND GLITTERING PERSONAGES OF FASHION COMPLETELY FILLING THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE BUILDING THOUGH THE KING SO FREQUENTLY PATRONIZED THE LOCAL STAGE DURING THESE YEARS THAT THE CRUSH WAS NOT INCONVENIENT
HE SAID FAITH THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE FOLLOWED HER IF I HAD BEEN AS SURE AS YOU WERE THAT SHE WENT AWAY IN SCORN OF US SINCE YOU TOLD ME THAT
SHE IS ONLY IN A FAINT JOHN AND HER COLOUR IS COMING BACK
BUT AS HIS EYES WERE FIXED STEADILY UPON HER THIS WAS A FUTILE MANOEUVRE I SAW YOU LOOK ROUND HE EXCLAIMED CROSSLY
THE FIGURES OF THESE RURAL SUTLERS COULD BE SEEN CREEPING UP THE SLOPES LADEN LIKE BEES TO A SPOT IN THE REAR OF THE CAMP WHERE THERE WAS A KIND OF MARKET PLACE ON THE GREENSWARD MISSUS GARLAND ANNE AND THE MILLER
IN SPITE OF THE DARKNESS THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER BOB THEREUPON SHUT THE DOOR WHICH BEING BUT OF SLIGHT CONSTRUCTION WAS AS HE KNEW ONLY A MOMENTARY DEFENCE
THERE'S LOTS ABOUT HERE THEN COME THIS WAY A MOMENT WITH YOUR LIGHT TWO OF THE GROUP WENT TOWARDS THE CART HOUSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE YARD AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT A DARK LANTERN WAS OPENED THE RAYS BEING DIRECTED UPON THE FRONT OF THE MILLER'S WAGGON
THE TALE OF THE BLACK DIAMOND HAD DISTURBED HER BY A SLOW INSIDIOUS PROCESS THAT WAS WORSE THAN SUDDEN FRIGHT HER WINDOW LOOKED INTO THE COURT BEFORE THE HOUSE NOW WRAPPED IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES AND THE HILL AND SHE LEANED UPON ITS SILL LISTENING INTENTLY
THE PICKLE SCHOONER LIEUTENANT LAPENOTIERE HAD ARRIVED AT FALMOUTH WITH DESPATCHES FROM THE FLEET THAT THE STAGE COACHES ON THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WESSEX TO LONDON WERE CHALKED WITH THE WORDS GREAT VICTORY
WHEN THEY EMERGED UPON THE ESPLANADE THE AUGUST MOON WAS SHINING ACROSS THE SEA FROM THE DIRECTION OF SAINT ALDHELM'S HEAD BOB UNCONSCIOUSLY LOITERED AND TURNED TOWARDS THE PIER REACHING THE END OF THE PROMENADE THEY SURVEYED THE QUIVERING WATERS IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME
AND BEYOND THEM WAS THE GREY SEA PARTED INTO TWO MASSES BY THE TAPERING BRAID OF MOONLIGHT ACROSS THE WAVES TWO FORMS CROSSED THIS LINE AT A STARTLING NEARNESS TO HER SHE MARKED THEM AT ONCE AS ANNE AND BOB LOVEDAY THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY
AND DANGLING FROM THE CAT HEAD PROJECTING ABOVE IT WAS THE ROPE USED IN LIFTING THEM THERE'S THE WAY HE WENT DOWN THE OFFICER CONTINUED THE MAN'S GONE AMIDST MUMBLINGS AND CURSES THE GANG DESCENDED THE PAIR OF LADDERS AND CAME INTO THE OPEN AIR BUT CAPTAIN BOB WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
WHY DIDN'T HE COME HOME OR IF HE COULDN'T GET LEAVE WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE TIS SCANDALOUS OF HIM TO SERVE A WOMAN LIKE THAT GENTLY GENTLY
AH SHE'S BACK AGAIN CRIED BOB SEIZING DAVID ECSTATICALLY AND DANCING ROUND WITH HIM NO BUT IT'S ALL THE SAME
A VETERAN POLITICIAN AND ONE OF MISTER PLATT'S RIGHT HAND MEN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE FIGHT SHOWED THAT THIS SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE
THIS IS THE MOST STRIKING KIND OF SUCCESS AND IT CAN BE ATTAINED ONLY BY THE MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE QUALITY WHICH SEPARATES HIM IN KIND NO LESS THAN IN DEGREE FROM HIS FELLOWS BUT MUCH THE COMMONER TYPE OF SUCCESS IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE AND IN EVERY SPECIES OF EFFORT
YOU ARE PERHAPS AWARE THAT MISTER DENISON OF THE JAPANESE FOREIGN OFFICE WAS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE HAGUE
NOW STRAIGHTEN YOUR LEGS AND LET YOUR RIFLE GO TO THE GROUND HE REMONSTRATED SAYING THE RIFLE WOULD GO OFF AND I TOLD HIM TO LET IT GO OFF HOWEVER HE STRAIGHTENED HIS LEGS IN SUCH FASHION THAT IT CAME TO THE GROUND WITHOUT A JAR I THEN MADE HIM MOVE BACK AND PICKED UP THE RIFLE
WE HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK A SPRESS CHAIR AND SPRESS TABLE IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY THE SPRESS CHAIR AND TABLE WERE RECEIVED WITH SUCH RAPTURE THAT WE HAD TO GET DUPLICATES FOR THE OTHER SMALL MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO WAS THE PARTICULAR CRONY OF THE PROPRIETOR OF THE NEW TREASURES
TOWARDS THE END OF THE DINNER THEY COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ASKING IF THE TORPEDO FLOTILLA WAS TO GO ROUND WITH THE BIG SHIPS I TOLD THEM NO THAT THE ADMIRALS AND CAPTAINS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORPEDO BOATS COULD STAND IT
WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I HEARTILY APPROVED THE EFFORT TO GET BOXING CLUBS STARTED IN NEW YORK ON A CLEAN BASIS LATER I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRIZE RING HAD BECOME HOPELESSLY DEBASED AND DEMORALIZED
I SECURED BETTER ADMINISTRATION AND SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAWS THEMSELVES THE IMPROVEMENT IN ADMINISTRATION AND IN THE CHARACTER OF THE GAME AND FOREST WARDENS WAS SECURED PARTLY AS THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE
MANY PERSONS PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY PROTESTED AGAINST THE MOVE ON THE GROUND THAT JAPAN WOULD ACCEPT IT AS A THREAT TO THIS I ANSWERED NOTHING IN PUBLIC IN PRIVATE I SAID THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE JAPAN WOULD SO REGARD IT
PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECT IS THE KEEN HUNT FOR DEFECTS IN THE MACHINERY CAUSING WASTE OF POWER THE YANKTON BY RESETTING VALVES INCREASED HER SPEED FROM TEN TO ELEVEN AND A HALF KNOTS ON THE SAME EXPENDITURE ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE BUT THE FIELD IS WIDENING
IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
WHO AT ONCE TOOK THEM TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF WASHINGTON IN THE LANDAU THE PRESIDENT'S LAND HO AS WITH SEAFARING HUMOR OUR GUESTS IMMEDIATELY STYLED IT ONCE AFTER WE WERE IN PRIVATE LIFE AGAIN
THE LITTLE BOY'S FEELINGS OVERCAME HIM HE HAD BEEN LOANED A KING SNAKE WHICH AS ALL NATURE LOVERS KNOW IS NOT ONLY A USEFUL BUT A BEAUTIFUL SNAKE VERY FRIENDLY TO HUMAN BEINGS AND HE CAME RUSHING HOME TO SHOW THE TREASURE
TEN DAYS LATER AT SAGAMORE HILL I WAS AMONG MY OWN BIRDS AND WAS MUCH INTERESTED AS I LISTENED TO AND LOOKED AT THEM IN REMEMBERING THE NOTES AND ACTIONS OF THE BIRDS I HAD SEEN IN ENGLAND
I ANSWERED THAT I DID NOT EXPECT IT THAT I BELIEVED THAT JAPAN WOULD FEEL AS FRIENDLY IN THE MATTER AS WE DID BUT THAT IF MY EXPECTATIONS HAD PROVED MISTAKEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROOF POSITIVE THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ATTACKED ANYHOW
HE SAYS THAT AT THE OUTSET ALMOST EVERY MAN IS FRIGHTENED WHEN HE GOES INTO ACTION
THEY WERE INTIMATE FRIENDS WITH THE COWS CHICKENS PIGS AND OTHER LIVE STOCK
THIS BEING ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY ARE RELEGATED TO THEIR PRESENT ABODE BUT THE BOOKS HAVE OVERFLOWED INTO ALL THE OTHER ROOMS TOO I COULD NOT NAME ANY PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE BOOKS HAVE BEEN GATHERED BOOKS ARE ALMOST AS INDIVIDUAL AS FRIENDS
IT WAS WHILE HUNTING IN VAIN FOR A GROUSE THAT I CAME ON THE BEAR AND KILLED IT AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WHEN I REACHED THE SETTLEMENT AND WENT INTO THE STORE THE STOREKEEPER IDENTIFIED ME BY REMARKING YOU'RE THE TENDERFOOT THAT OLD HANK WAS TRUNDLING AIN'T YOU
GIVING THE ADDRESS TO BE MADE TO THE EMPEROR WAS RECEIVED I GAVE COPIES OF IT TO OUR AMBASSADOR TO BE SENT TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE IT SEEMS THAT THE EMPEROR HAD ALREADY PREPARED A VERY CORDIAL ADDRESS TO BE FORWARDED THROUGH ME TO YOU AFTER DELIVERY AT THE AUDIENCE
WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS IN NO WAY OR SHAPE AROUSED
INSTEAD OF THE HEADING I ACTUALLY DID USE
THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
A BOOK MUST BE INTERESTING TO THE PARTICULAR READER AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME
THE ONLY ONLOOKERS BEING THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAITHFUL FAMILIES MY TWO PONIES WERE THE ONLY OCCUPANTS OF MY STABLE EXCEPT A CART HORSE MY WIFE AND I RODE AND DROVE THEM AND THEY WERE USED FOR HOUSEHOLD ERRANDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN AND FOR TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK THEY SERVED ME AS POLO PONIES
I DO NOT FOR A MINUTE MEAN THAT THE STATESMAN OUGHT NOT TO READ A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT BOOKS OF THIS CHARACTER JUST AS EVERY ONE ELSE SHOULD READ THEM BUT IN THE FINAL EVENT THE STATESMAN AND THE PUBLICIST AND THE REFORMER AND THE AGITATOR FOR NEW THINGS
WHERE THE MEN GOT EXCELLENT MEALS AND COULD REST SMOKE AND WRITE LETTERS AND IN NONE OF THESE PLACES WOULD THEY ALLOW THE MEN TO PAY ANYTHING THOUGH THEY WERE MORE THAN READY TO DO SO THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE MARVELOUSLY PERFECT AS SOON AS YOUR TELEGRAM OF OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH
FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
I WOULD DRAG ONE OF THE CHILDREN'S WAGONS AND WHEN THE VERY SMALLEST PAIRS OF FEET GREW TIRED OF TRUDGING BRAVELY AFTER US OR OF RACING ON RAPTUROUS SIDE TRIPS AFTER FLOWERS AND OTHER TREASURES THE OWNERS WOULD CLAMBER INTO THE WAGON ONE OF THESE WAGONS BY THE WAY
WHY THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IS THE HAPPINESS THAT COMES AS A BY PRODUCT OF STRIVING TO DO WHAT MUST BE DONE EVEN THOUGH SORROW IS MET IN THE DOING
A DOZEN YEARS LATER HAVING IN THE MEANTIME MADE A MARKED SUCCESS IN A BUSINESS CAREER HE BECAME THE TREASURER OF THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY MY ACTION IN REGARD TO THE CANALS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME BY COLONEL PARTRIDGE
MY CHIEF OPPONENTS AND CRITICS WERE LOCAL POLITICIANS WHO WERE TRUCKLING TO THE LABOR VOTE BUT IN ALL CASES COMING UNDER THE FIRST TWO CATEGORIES I HAD SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH THE STATE LEADERS OF THE MACHINE I ALWAYS DID MY BEST IN GOOD FAITH
BUT THEY HAD TO HAVE SOME OUTLET FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME WAY I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED BOXING AS A FIRST CLASS SPORT TO ENCOURAGE IN THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE YOUNG CHRISTIANS WITH SHOULDERS THAT SLOPE LIKE A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE
I FOUND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ELECT MISTER WOODRUFF WHO HAD ALSO BEEN ASKED TO COME THE SENATOR INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS GLAD TO SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE A MOST ADMIRABLE MAN AS SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AS HE HAD JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN WHOM HE NAMED
AND HAPPENING TO RUMMAGE IN IT FOR SOMETHING I FOUND THE WHISKY FLASK WAS EMPTY I TURNED ON HIM AT ONCE AND ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING DRUNK IT TO WHICH HE MERELY RESPONDED BY ASKING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO ABOUT IT THERE DID NOT SEEM MUCH TO DO SO I SAID THAT WE WOULD PART COMPANY
WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET PRECISELY AS I TOOK PANAMA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET A COUNCIL OF WAR NEVER FIGHTS AND IN A CRISIS THE DUTY OF A LEADER IS TO LEAD
OF COURSE ANY READER OUGHT TO CULTIVATE HIS OR HER TASTE SO THAT GOOD BOOKS WILL APPEAL TO IT AND THAT TRASH WON'T BUT AFTER THIS POINT HAS ONCE BEEN REACHED THE NEEDS OF EACH READER MUST BE MET IN A FASHION THAT WILL APPEAL TO THOSE NEEDS
I HAD BEEN VERY SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN WOULD UNDERSTAND ARIGHT WHAT THE CRUISE MEANT AND WOULD ACCEPT THE VISIT OF OUR FLEET AS THE SIGNAL HONOR WHICH IT WAS MEANT TO BE A PROOF OF THE HIGH REGARD AND FRIENDSHIP I FELT
AND IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT EYE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNABLE TO SHOOT ACCORDINGLY I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN AND WOULD HAVE TO STOP BOXING
THE CATBIRDS HAVE SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE SONG THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IRRITATING TO KNOW THAT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MAY INTERRUPT IT TO MEW AND SQUEAL THE BOLD CHEERY MUSIC OF THE ROBINS ALWAYS SEEMS TYPICAL OF THE BOLD CHEERY BIRDS THEMSELVES
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
IN NO COUNTRY WITH AN ARMY WORTH CALLING SUCH IS THERE A CHANCE FOR A MAN PHYSICALLY UNFIT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE
THERE WERE A FEW OF THE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLYMEN WHOM I COULD REACH BY SEEING THEM PERSONALLY AND PUTTING BEFORE THEM MY ARGUMENTS BUT MOST OF THEM WERE TOO MUCH UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE FOR ME TO SHAKE THEM LOOSE UNLESS THEY KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ACTIVELY BEHIND ME
AS FOR THE EFFECT OF THE CRUISE UPON THE TRAINING DISCIPLINE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FLEET THE GOOD CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED IT IS A WAR GAME IN EVERY DETAIL THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN MAINTAINED WITH AN EFFICIENCY HITHERTO UNHEARD OF
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR OWN FLEETS COULD PERFORM THE FEAT AND STILL LESS DID THEY BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN FLEET COULD I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT WAS TIME TO HAVE A SHOW DOWN IN THE MATTER
WE GOT NOT ONLY AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE LAW BUT A STILL MORE MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN ITS ADMINISTRATION THANKS CHIEFLY TO THE ACTIVITY AND GOOD SENSE OF DOCTOR JOHN H PRYOR OF BUFFALO AND BY THE USE OF EVERY POUND OF PRESSURE WHICH AS GOVERNOR I COULD BRING TO BEAR
THE THICKLY GRASSED HILLSIDE SLOPED DOWN IN FRONT OF ME TO A BELT OF FOREST FROM WHICH ROSE THE GOLDEN LEISURELY CHIMING OF THE WOOD THRUSHES CHANTING THEIR VESPERS THROUGH THE STILL AIR CAME THE WARBLE OF VIREO AND TANAGER
A SIOUX BUFFALO ROBE WITH ON IT PAINTED BY SOME LONG DEAD SIOUX ARTIST THE PICTURE STORY OF CUSTER'S FIGHT A BRONZE PORTRAIT PLAQUE OF JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS
IT MUST BE PROFOUNDLY GRATIFYING TO YOU TO HAVE THE MISSION ON WHICH YOU SENT THE FLEET TERMINATE SO HAPPILY AND I AM PROFOUNDLY THANKFUL THAT OWING TO THE CONFIDENCE WHICH YOU DISPLAYED IN GIVING ME THIS COMMAND
AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
MY COMPANIONS AT TENNIS OR ON THESE RIDES AND WALKS WE GRADUALLY GREW TO STYLE THE TENNIS CABINET AND THEN WE EXTENDED THE TERM TO TAKE IN MANY OF MY OLD TIME WESTERN FRIENDS SUCH AS BEN DANIELS SETH BULLOCK LUTHER KELLY
REPEATED AND PERSISTENT EFFORT I FAILED TO GET THEM TO SUPPORT ME THEN I MADE A FAIR FIGHT IN THE OPEN AND IN A MAJORITY OF CASES I CARRIED MY POINT AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THROUGH THE LEGISLATION WHICH I WISHED IN THEORY THE EXECUTIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGISLATION
AS IN EVERY HOUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT APPEAL TO THE HOUSEHOLDER BECAUSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATIONS BUT WHICH WOULD NOT MEAN MUCH TO OTHERS NATURALLY ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND FILLED OTHER POSITIONS ACCUMULATES SUCH THINGS
WHETHER OF PROSE OR OF POETRY THE ROOM FOR CHOICE IS SO LIMITLESS THAT TO MY MIND IT SEEMS ABSURD TO TRY TO MAKE CATALOGUES WHICH SHALL BE SUPPOSED TO APPEAL TO ALL THE BEST THINKERS
WE LOVE THE SCREAMING OF THE RED TAILED HAWKS AS THEY SOAR HIGH OVERHEAD AND EVEN THE CALLS OF THE NIGHT HERON THAT NEST IN THE TALL WATER MAPLES BY ONE OF THE WOOD PONDS ON OUR PLACE AND THE LITTLE GREEN HERONS THAT NEST BESIDE THE SALT MARSH
BETWEEN MAN AND MAN SHALL END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE ALL THIS IS TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO MEN MORE IGNOBLE OR MORE FOOLISH NO MEN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE FRAUGHT WITH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF MISCHIEF
INCLUDING THE SO CALLED MUGWUMP PRESS TO DETERMINE THIS MATTER I APPOINTED TWO DEMOCRATIC LAWYERS MESSRS FOX AND MAC FARLANE THE LATTER FEDERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NEW YORK UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND AND PUT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION IN THEIR HANDS
BECAUSE I HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE SPEAKER WHO APPOINTED THE COMMITTEES HAD HIMSELF BEEN AGREED UPON BY THE MEMBERS ELECT OH RESPONDED THE SENATOR WITH A TOLERANT SMILE HE HAS NOT BEEN CHOSEN YET BUT OF COURSE WHOEVER WE CHOOSE AS SPEAKER WILL AGREE BEFOREHAND TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS WE WISH
WE WERE OUT OF COMMUNICATION WITH A CABLE STATION FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT
AND THERE WAS NO NATION IN THE WORLD WITH WHOM A WAR CLOUD THREATENED NO NATION IN THE WORLD WHOM WE HAD WRONGED OR FROM WHOM WE HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR THE CRUISE OF THE BATTLE FLEET WAS NOT THE LEAST OF THE CAUSES WHICH ENSURED SO PEACEFUL AN OUTLOOK
THERE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH CLIMBING WHEN WE WALKED DOWN THE POTOMAC TO WASHINGTON FROM THE VIRGINIA END OF THE CHAIN BRIDGE I WOULD OCCASIONALLY TAKE SOME BIG GAME FRIEND FROM ABROAD SELOUS OR SAINT GEORGE LITTLEDALE
I HAD ALWAYS BEEN INSTINCTIVELY AND BY NATURE A DEMOCRAT BUT IF I HAD NEEDED CONVERSION TO THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL HERE IN AMERICA
ALAS THE BLIGHT HAS NOW DESTROYED THE CHESTNUT TREES AND ROBBED OUR WOODS OF ONE OF THEIR DISTINCTIVE BEAUTIES OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL SINGERS ARE THE WOOD THRUSHES THEY SING NOT ONLY IN THE EARLY MORNING BUT THROUGHOUT THE LONG HOT JUNE AFTERNOONS
SAT DOWN OPPOSITE ME AND PUT A VERY EXPENSIVE CIGAR ON THE DESK SAYING HAVE A CIGAR I THANKED HIM AND SAID I DID NOT SMOKE TO WHICH HE RESPONDED PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET HE THEN ADDED TAKE ANOTHER PUT BOTH IN YOUR POCKET THIS I ACCORDINGLY DID
IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
BUT WITHOUT REGARD TO POLITICS A WEEK OR SO AFTER THE SPEAKERSHIP INCIDENT SENATOR PLATT ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE HIM HE WAS AN OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE MAN ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT ONLY WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ON ARRIVAL
IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBER WHICH I HELD WITH FORTY OF THE BEST GUIDES AND WOODSMEN OF THE ADIRONDACKS AS REGARDS MOST LEGISLATION EVEN THAT AFFECTING LABOR AND THE FORESTS I GOT ON FAIRLY WELL WITH THE MACHINE BUT ON THE TWO ISSUES IN WHICH BIG BUSINESS
PAY THE STATE WHAT THEY PROPERLY OUGHT TO PAY THEY STOOD BY ME WHEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRIKES ON THE CROTON AQUEDUCT AND IN BUFFALO I PROMPTLY USED THE MILITARY POWER OF THE STATE TO PUT A STOP TO RIOTING AND VIOLENCE IN THE LATTER CASE
THE GUN ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE WHICH INCIDENTALLY HAS THE LOVELIEST VIEW OF ALL CONTAINS MORE BOOKS THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ROOMS AND THEY ARE PARTICULARLY DELIGHTFUL BOOKS TO BROWSE AMONG JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT MUCH RELEVANCE TO ONE ANOTHER
AND WHOM I HAD DECLINED TO REAPPOINT HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ANY ACTION BECAUSE OF WHICH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PROCEED AGAINST THEM CRIMINALLY OR OTHERWISE UNDER THE LAW SUCH CRIMINAL ACTION HAD BEEN FREELY CHARGED AGAINST THEM DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY THE DEMOCRATIC
WHEN OBLIGED TO LIVE IN CITIES I FOR A LONG TIME FOUND THAT BOXING AND WRESTLING ENABLED ME TO GET A GOOD DEAL OF EXERCISE IN CONDENSED AND ATTRACTIVE FORM I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO ABANDON BOTH AS I GREW OLDER
EACH ONE OF WHICH IF REALLY READ REALLY ASSIMILATED BY THE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAPPENS TO APPEAL WILL ENABLE THAT PERSON QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO FURNISH HIMSELF WITH MUCH AMMUNITION WHICH HE WILL FIND OF USE IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE
AND AS GOVERNOR I AIDED IN THE PASSAGE OF AND SIGNED THE BILL PUTTING A STOP TO PROFESSIONAL BOXING FOR MONEY THIS WAS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PRIZE FIGHTERS THEMSELVES WERE CROOKED
THEY ASSURED ME THAT THE ENLISTED MEN WERE EVEN MORE ANXIOUS TO GO THAN WERE THE OFFICERS MENTIONING THAT ON ONE OF THEIR BOATS THE TERMS OF ENLISTMENT OF MOST OF THE CREW WERE OUT AND THE MEN WERE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT TO REENLIST
NOR YET TO THE CRUISERS OR TORPEDO BOATS YOU LEFT THIS COAST IN A HIGH STATE OF BATTLE EFFICIENCY AND YOU RETURN WITH YOUR EFFICIENCY INCREASED BETTER PREPARED THAN WHEN YOU LEFT NOT ONLY IN PERSONNEL BUT EVEN IN MATERIAL
WITH SCANT REGARD TO HIS OWN PERSONAL MERITS PERHAPS OUR MOST CHERISHED POSSESSIONS ARE A REMINGTON BRONZE THE BRONCO BUSTER GIVEN ME BY MY MEN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS MUSTERED OUT
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OFFICERS WHO DO NOT WALK ANY MORE THAN IS NECESSARY TO REACH A STREET CAR THAT WILL CARRY THEM FROM THEIR RESIDENCES TO THEIR OFFICES
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
NIGHT HERON RED TAILED HAWK YELLOW BILLED CUCKOO KINGFISHER FLICKER HUMMING BIRD SWIFT MEADOW LARK RED WINGED BLACKBIRD SHARP TAILED FINCH
TO GET MISTER PLATT AND THE OTHER HEADS OF THE MACHINE TO ACCEPT MY VIEWS AND TO CONVINCE THEM BY REPEATED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS RIGHT I NEVER WANTONLY ANTAGONIZED OR HUMILIATED THEM I DID NOT WISH TO HUMILIATE THEM OR TO SEEM VICTORIOUS OVER THEM
WHY THERE ARE SCORES AND SCORES OF SOLID HISTORIES THE BEST IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE AS ABSORBING AS THE BEST OF ALL THE NOVELS AND OF AS PERMANENT VALUE THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF DARWIN AND HUXLEY AND CARLYLE AND EMERSON AND PARTS OF KANT
BY OUR OWN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY BUT ALSO BY OTHER PEOPLES THAT THE PACIFIC WAS AS MUCH OUR HOME WATERS AS THE ATLANTIC AND THAT OUR FLEET COULD AND WOULD AT WILL PASS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO GREAT OCEANS
BUT WAS WAGED FROM A SENSE OF DUTY FOR REAL AND TANGIBLE CAUSES SUCH AS THE PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND HONESTY AND FORCING POWERFUL MONEYED MEN TO TAKE THE PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE
AT THE BLASTED PINE I LOOKED ROUND AND AS I COULD SEE HIM IN CAMP I LEFT HIS RIFLE THERE I THEN TRAVELED TILL DARK AND THAT NIGHT FOR THE ONLY TIME IN MY EXPERIENCE I USED IN CAMPING A TRICK OF THE OLD TIME TRAPPERS IN THE INDIAN DAYS
BUT THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION I LAID THEIR REPORT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MESSAGE IN WHICH I SAID THERE IS PROBABLY NO LAWYER OF HIGH STANDING IN THE STATE WHO
AND IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO FEEL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THEIR RECEIVING PUNISHMENT WHICH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY DO NOT MIND OF COURSE THE MEN WHO LOOK ON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP WITH THE GLOVES OR WITHOUT THEM THEMSELVES
THE WORK HAS ONLY BEGUN C S SPERRY WHEN I LEFT THE PRESIDENCY I FINISHED SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS OF ADMINISTRATION DURING WHICH NOT ONE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AGAINST A FOREIGN FOE WE WERE AT ABSOLUTE PEACE
RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
FINALLY ONE DAY HE DECLINED TO GO OUT WITH ME SAYING THAT HE HAD A PAIN WHEN THAT AFTERNOON I GOT BACK TO CAMP I SPEEDILY FOUND WHAT THE PAIN WAS WE WERE TRAVELING VERY LIGHT INDEED
HE WAS GIVING A VIVID RENDERING OF FARRAGUT AT MOBILE BAY FROM MEMORIES OF HOW I HAD TOLD THE STORY MY PASTEBOARD RAMS AND MONITORS WERE FASCINATING IF A NAVAL ARCHITECT MAY BE ALLOWED TO PRAISE HIS OWN WORK
AND BY AS STALWART A SET OF MEN OF WAR'S MEN AS EVER LOOKED THROUGH A PORTHOLE

AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
OR HISTORY TO WHICH WE OF THE HOUSEHOLD HABITUALLY TURN LET ME ADD THAT OURS IS IN NO SENSE A COLLECTOR'S LIBRARY EACH BOOK WAS PROCURED BECAUSE SOME ONE OF THE FAMILY WISHED TO READ IT
NOW THEN MEN THREE CHEERS FOR THEODORE ROOSEVELT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN CITIZEN THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A VERY GOOD WAY TOO
AND LEFT YOU AGAIN WHEN YOU WERE HALF WAY ROUND THE WORLD YOU HAVE FALSIFIED EVERY PREDICTION OF THE PROPHETS OF FAILURE IN ALL YOUR LONG CRUISE NOT AN ACCIDENT WORTHY OF MENTION HAS HAPPENED TO A SINGLE BATTLESHIP
TOLSTOY'S NOVELS ARE GOOD AT ONE TIME
WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
OF COURSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD TO ARRANGE THAT OUR RETURN TO WASHINGTON SHOULD BE WHEN IT WAS DARK SO THAT OUR APPEARANCE MIGHT SCANDALIZE NO ONE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE THUS SWAM ROCK CREEK IN THE EARLY SPRING WHEN THE ICE WAS FLOATING THICK UPON IT
I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE ONLY WAY I COULD BEAT THE BOSSES WHENEVER THE NEED TO DO SO AROSE AND UNLESS THERE WAS SUCH NEED I DID NOT WISH TO TRY WAS NOT BY ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE MACHINERY AND NOT BY TRUSTING MERELY TO THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS
I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE I THINK YOUR HARBOR THE FINEST IN THE WORLD I AM VERY TIRED AND WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SLEEP
THERE WAS NO FURTHER DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE MONEY IT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY MY INTENTION THAT THE FLEET SHOULD VISIT AUSTRALIA BUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SENT A MOST CORDIAL INVITATION WHICH I GLADLY ACCEPTED
ACCORDINGLY I MERELY ISSUED DIRECTIONS THAT EACH OFFICER SHOULD PROVE HIS ABILITY TO WALK FIFTY MILES OR RIDE ONE HUNDRED IN THREE DAYS THIS IS OF COURSE A TEST WHICH MANY A HEALTHY MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET
THE BIRDS WERE STILL IN FULL SONG FOR ON LONG ISLAND THERE IS LITTLE ABATEMENT IN THE CHORUS UNTIL ABOUT THE SECOND WEEK OF JULY WHEN THE BLOSSOMING OF THE CHESTNUT TREES PATCHES THE WOODLAND WITH FROTHY GREENISH YELLOW
WHOM I WISHED TO HAVE PUT ON ANY COMMITTEE EXPLAINING THAT THE COMMITTEES WERE BEING ARRANGED I ANSWERED NO
WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I FOUND AND JACOB RIIS WILL BACK ME UP IN THIS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BOXING CLUB IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD ALWAYS TENDED TO DO AWAY WITH KNIFING AND GUN FIGHTING AMONG THE YOUNG FELLOWS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN IN MURDEROUS GANGS
FROM THENCE I ORDERED THEM TO NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA THEN TO THE PHILIPPINES CHINA AND JAPAN AND HOME THROUGH SUEZ THEY STOPPED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO HELP THE SUFFERERS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AT MESSINA BY THE WAY
WHEN OUR OWN CHILDREN WERE LITTLE WE WERE FOR SEVERAL WINTERS IN WASHINGTON AND EACH SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE WHOLE FAMILY SPENT IN ROCK CREEK PARK WHICH WAS THEN VERY REAL COUNTRY INDEED
WHEN I WAS IN COMPANY WITH ADMIRAL EVANS AND CAPTAIN COWLES AND AGAIN ON THE SYLPH AND ON THE MAYFLOWER WE ALSO DINED AS GUESTS OF THE CREW WHEN WE FINISHED OUR TRIP ON THE LOUISIANA I MADE A SHORT SPEECH TO THE ASSEMBLED CREW
WHO REFUSED TO AUDIT A BILL I PUT IN FOR A WRESTLING MAT EXPLAINING THAT I COULD HAVE A BILLIARD TABLE BILLIARDS BEING RECOGNIZED AS A PROPER GUBERNATORIAL AMUSEMENT BUT THAT A WRESTLING MAT SYMBOLIZED SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND UNHEARD OF AND COULD NOT BE PERMITTED
WAS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SECRET OR CLANDESTINE MEETING I ALWAYS INSISTED ON GOING OPENLY SOLEMN REFORMERS OF THE TOM FOOL VARIETY WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM
AND BEGAN TO MOVE AROUND TO GET SOME FLOUR AND SALT PORK
WHO IS RETICENT AND CONSERVATIVE TOLD ME THAT NOT ONLY THE EMPEROR BUT ALL THE MINISTERS WERE PROFOUNDLY GRATIFIED BY THE COURSE OF EVENTS I AM CONFIDENT THAT NOT EVEN THE MOST TRIFLING INCIDENT HAS TAKEN PLACE WHICH COULD IN ANY WAY MAR THE GENERAL SATISFACTION
IS THE SOLUTION I SHALL HAVE TO ADOPT REMEMBER THE BREAKFAST AT DOUGLAS ROBINSON'S AT EIGHT THIRTY THERE WERE VARIOUS MEASURES TO WHICH HE GAVE A GRUDGING AND QUERULOUS ASSENT WITHOUT ANY BREAK BEING THREATENED I SECURED THE REENACTMENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW
ALTHOUGH HE GREETED ME AFFABLY WITH GOOD AFTERNOON COLONEL HALF AN HOUR LATER SOMEBODY ASKED HIM WHERE'S FATHER TO WHICH HE RESPONDED I DON'T KNOW BUT THE COLONEL IS TAKING A BATH
UNDER THE THEN EXISTING CONDITIONS WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION SO FAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED I THEREFORE MADE NO EFFORT TO CREATE A MACHINE OF MY OWN AND CONSISTENTLY ADOPTED THE PLAN OF GOING OVER THE HEADS OF THE MEN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AND OF THE MEN IN CONTROL OF THE ORGANIZATION
BY THIS TIME HE WAS QUITE SOBER AND REALLY DID NOT SEEM ANGRY LOOKING AT ME QUIZZICALLY HE TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD GIVE HIM BACK HIS RIFLE HE WOULD CALL IT QUITS AND WE COULD GO ON TOGETHER
BUT MERELY AS JOHNNY GOFF'S TOURIST OF COURSE DURING THE YEARS WHEN I WAS MOST BUSY AT SERIOUS WORK I COULD DO NO HUNTING AND EVEN MY RIDING WAS OF A DECOROUS KIND
THESE GENTLEMEN MADE AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS THEY REPORTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN GRAVE DELINQUENCY IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORK DELINQUENCY WHICH JUSTIFIED PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT WHO WERE OUT OF OFFICE
HAVE SHOWN YOURSELVES THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE AMBASSADORS AND HERALDS OF PEACE WHEREVER YOU HAVE LANDED YOU HAVE BORNE YOURSELVES SO AS TO MAKE US AT HOME PROUD OF BEING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED IN A GLOVE FIGHT OR BARE FIST FIGHT TO STOP IT WHEN ONE COMPETITOR IS HOPELESSLY OUTCLASSED OR TOO BADLY HAMMERED BUT THE MEN WHO TAKE PART IN THESE FIGHTS ARE HARD AS NAILS
AND THAT NO EXCUSE OF ANY KIND WOULD BE ACCEPTED IF THERE WERE A SUDDEN ATTACK OF ANY KIND AND WE WERE TAKEN UNAWARES MY PRIME PURPOSE WAS TO IMPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THIS PURPOSE WAS FULLY ACHIEVED
I HAVING PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT MY BUFFALO SLEEPING BAG MY WASH KIT AND A PAIR OF SOCKS I HAD ALSO TAKEN A FLASK OF WHISKY FOR EMERGENCIES ALTHOUGH AS I FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCIES NEVER AROSE AND THAT TEA WAS BETTER THAN WHISKY WHEN A MAN WAS COLD OR DONE OUT
THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
MAY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN O EIGHT MY DEAR CAPTAIN CONE A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FEAT OF OUR BATTLESHIP FLEET IN ENCIRCLING SOUTH AMERICA AND GETTING TO SAN FRANCISCO
THE PEOPLE ACCEPTED AND PRACTICED IN A MATTER OF COURSE WAY AS QUITE PROPER
I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME HAD THE FRIENDSHIP OF JOHN L SULLIVAN THAN WHOM IN HIS PRIME NO BETTER MAN EVER STEPPED INTO THE RING HE IS NOW A MASSACHUSETTS FARMER JOHN USED OCCASIONALLY TO VISIT ME AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUT THE NAVAL OFFICERS FEEL NO SUCH NECESSITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR MEN DO NOT HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFICIENCY BY PRACTICE MARCHES AND THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE TO DO A STUNT THAT WILL SHOW UP THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEFFICIENCY IN THE MATTER
IT IS THE ONLY KIND OF SUCCESS THAT IS OPEN TO MOST OF US YET SOME OF THE GREATEST SUCCESSES IN HISTORY HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THIS SECOND CLASS
I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY ATTEMPTED THE SAME PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNOR ELECT THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES MISTAKEN IN A FEW DAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THIS ARRIVED
FOR THE REASONS GIVEN ABOVE TWENTY MILES IN TWO DAYS EVERY OTHER MONTH WOULD DO THE BUSINESS WHILE TEN MILES EACH MONTH DOES NOT TOUCH IT SIMPLY BECAUSE NOBODY HAS TO WALK ON NEXT DAY FEET AS FOR THE PROPOSED TEST OF SO MANY HOURS EXERCISE A WEEK
THE MOST NOTEWORTHY INCIDENT OF THE CRUISE WAS THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO OUR FLEET IN JAPAN IN COURTESY AND GOOD BREEDING THE JAPANESE CAN CERTAINLY TEACH MUCH TO THE NATIONS OF THE WESTERN WORLD
SAYING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE POSITION HE HANDED ME THE TELEGRAM THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS A MAN I LIKED
AND WHAT NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING NO PERSEVERANCE OR WILL POWER WILL ENABLE ANY ORDINARY MAN TO DO THIS SUCCESS OF COURSE LIKE EVERY OTHER KIND OF SUCCESS MAY BE ON A VERY BIG SCALE OR ON A SMALL SCALE
TO THE FACT THAT THE MACHINE POLITICIANS WERE NOT GIVING THEM THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WISHED AS THIS WAKING UP GREW MORE GENERAL NOT MERELY IN NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER ONE STATE BUT THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE NATION THE POWER OF THE BOSSES WANED
YET AT THE SAME TIME HE MUST AVOID THAT MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL THE INDICATIONS OF PUFFED UP VANITY WHICH CONSISTS IN TREATING MERE INDIVIDUAL AND PERHAPS UNFORTUNATE IDIOSYNCRASY AS A MATTER OF PRIDE I HAPPEN TO BE DEVOTED TO MACBETH
POLO IS A GOOD GAME INFINITELY BETTER FOR VIGOROUS MEN THAN TENNIS OR GOLF OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND THERE IS ALL THE FUN OF FOOTBALL WITH THE HORSE THROWN IN
THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES NEST IN THE YOUNG ELMS AROUND THE HOUSE AND THE ORCHARD ORIOLES IN THE APPLE TREES NEAR THE GARDEN AND OUTBUILDINGS AMONG THE EARLIEST SOUNDS OF SPRING IS THE CHEERFUL SIMPLE HOMELY SONG OF THE SONG SPARROW
WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP THE OLD FELLOW WAS SITTING ON A TREE TRUNK VERY ERECT WITH HIS RIFLE ACROSS HIS KNEES AND IN RESPONSE TO MY NOD OF GREETING HE MERELY LEERED AT ME I LEANED MY RIFLE AGAINST A TREE WALKED OVER TO WHERE MY BED WAS LYING
CERTAINLY I NEVER KNEW SMALL PEOPLE TO HAVE A BETTER TIME OR A BETTER TRAINING FOR THEIR WORK IN AFTER LIFE THAN THE THREE FAMILIES OF COUSINS AT SAGAMORE HILL IT WAS REAL COUNTRY AND SPEAKING FROM THE SOMEWHAT DETACHED POINT OF VIEW OF THE MASCULINE PARENT
BUT I COULD RIDE AND WALK WELL ENOUGH FOR US ALL THOROUGHLY TO ENJOY IT OFTEN ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTERS AND EARLY SPRINGS WE WOULD ARRANGE FOR A POINT TO POINT WALK NOT TURNING ASIDE FOR ANYTHING FOR INSTANCE SWIMMING ROCK CREEK OR EVEN THE POTOMAC IF IT CAME IN OUR WAY
THEY WERE HIS LIEUTENANTS WHO COUNSELED AND INFLUENCED HIM WHOSE ADVICE HE OFTEN FOLLOWED BUT WHO WHEN HE HAD FINALLY MADE UP HIS MIND MERELY REGISTERED AND CARRIED OUT HIS DECREES AFTER A LITTLE CONVERSATION THE SENATOR ASKED IF I HAD ANY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY
IT SEEMED TO ME EVIDENT THAT SUCH A VOYAGE WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT THE NAVY ITSELF WOULD AROUSE POPULAR INTEREST IN AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NAVY AND WOULD MAKE FOREIGN NATIONS ACCEPT AS A MATTER OF COURSE
AND THE GOOD NATURED OWNER WOULD OCCASIONALLY LET HIM TAKE PETS HOME TO PLAY WITH ON ONE OCCASION I WAS HOLDING A CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS UNCLE PETE HEPBURN ABOUT THE RAILROAD RATE BILL
THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS WHO HAD MOST LOUDLY CRITICIZED THESE BOSSES BEGAN TO CHANGE TOWARD THEM NEWSPAPER EDITORS COLLEGE PRESIDENTS CORPORATION LAWYERS AND BIG BUSINESS MEN ALL ALIKE
AND BY SECURING ITS INEFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT
AND SKETCHES OF THE WHITE HOUSE BY SARGENT AND BY HOPKINSON SMITH THE BOOKS ARE EVERYWHERE THERE ARE AS MANY IN THE NORTH ROOM AND IN THE PARLOR IS DRAWING ROOM A MORE APPROPRIATE NAME THAN PARLOR AS IN THE LIBRARY
AND NOT MERELY TO ISSUE MANIFESTOES OF VIRTUE IT IS VERY EASY TO BE EFFICIENT IF THE EFFICIENCY IS BASED ON UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AND IT IS STILL EASIER TO BE VIRTUOUS IF ONE IS CONTENT WITH THE PURELY NEGATIVE VIRTUE WHICH CONSISTS IN NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG
YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
A VETERAN OF THE CIVIL WAR COLONEL PARTRIDGE WHO HAD SERVED IN MAYOR LOW'S ADMINISTRATION HE WAS AN EXCELLENT MAN IN EVERY WAY HE CHOSE AS HIS ASSISTANT ACTIVELY TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK
WHEN THE ELDEST SMALL BOY WAS GETTING WELL AND HAD RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS I SLEPT ON A SOFA BESIDE HIS BED THE SOFA BEING SO SHORT THAT MY FEET PROJECTED OVER ANYHOW
THE YANKTON REMAINED BEHIND TO KEEP UP COMMUNICATION FOR A FEW DAYS AND YESTERDAY SHE TRANSMITTED THE EMPEROR'S TELEGRAM TO YOU WHICH WAS SENT IN REPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH OUR AMBASSADOR AFTER THE SAILING OF THE FLEET
ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
I WAS DEALING WITH SHREWD HARD HEADED KINDLY MEN AND WOMEN CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE ABSORBING WORK OF EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING AND IMPATIENT OF FADS WHO HAD GROWN TO FEEL THAT THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD REFORMER WERE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD POLITICIAN
IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
BUT HE CAME FROM A CITY ALONG THE LINE OF THE CANAL
WHEN SHOWN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN CANDIDATES BY MACHINE WARD HEELERS OF A LOW TYPE HYSTERICALLY APPLAUDED SIMILAR CORRUPT TRICKERY WHEN PRACTICED BY THESE SAME POLITICIANS AGAINST MEN WITH WHOSE POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRAMME THE REFORMERS WERE NOT IN SYMPATHY
THERE IS NO EARTHLY USE IN LAYING DOWN GENERAL LAWS ABOUT THEM SOME MEET THE NEEDS OF ONE PERSON AND SOME OF ANOTHER AND EACH PERSON SHOULD BEWARE OF THE BOOKLOVER'S BESETTING SIN
A MAN WHO IS WORTH ANYTHING CAN NO MORE BE ENTIRELY IMPARTIAL IN SPEAKING OF THE BIRD SONGS WITH WHICH FROM HIS EARLIEST CHILDHOOD HE HAS BEEN FAMILIAR THAN HE CAN BE ENTIRELY IMPARTIAL IN SPEAKING OF HIS OWN FAMILY
THE FLAT FOOTS OF THE PENDULOUS BELLY MUSCLES ARE DELIGHTED THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THE QUESTION OF PEDOMETERS AND WILL HANG ONE OF THESE ON THEIR WHEEZY CHESTS AND LET IT COUNT EVERY SHUFFLING STEP THEY TAKE OUT OF DOORS
WHILE THE CROWD OF HANGERS ON WHO ATTENDED AND MADE UP AND PROFITED BY THE MATCHES HAD PLACED THE WHOLE BUSINESS ON A BASIS OF COMMERCIALISM AND BRUTALITY THAT WAS INTOLERABLE I SHALL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THAT BOXING CONTESTS THEMSELVES MAKE GOOD HEALTHY SPORT
THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE WHEN MY SUCCESSOR IN THE GOVERNORSHIP TOOK OFFICE COLONEL PARTRIDGE RETIRED AND ELON HOOKER FINDING THAT HE COULD NO LONGER ACT WITH ENTIRE DISREGARD OF POLITICS AND WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK ALSO LEFT
IS THAT WHICH COMES TO THE MAN WHO DIFFERS FROM HIS FELLOWS NOT BY THE KIND OF QUALITY WHICH HE POSSESSES BUT BY THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH HE HAS GIVEN THAT QUALITY
AND THEN PUSHED ON FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE HALTING TO TAKE BREAKFAST AND TO LET THE LITTLE MARE HAVE A GOOD FEED NO PLAINSMAN NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT A MAN SHOULD NOT LIE NEAR A FIRE IF THERE IS DANGER OF AN ENEMY CREEPING UP ON HIM
OF COURSE BOXING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN THE ARMY AND NAVY I WAS FIRST DRAWN TO TWO NAVAL CHAPLAINS FATHERS CHIDWICK AND RAINEY BY FINDING THAT EACH OF THEM HAD BOUGHT HALF A DOZEN SETS OF BOXING GLOVES AND ENCOURAGED THEIR CREWS IN BOXING
BUT BY MAKING MY APPEAL AS DIRECTLY AND AS EMPHATICALLY AS I KNEW HOW TO THE MASS OF VOTERS THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE TO THE MEN WHO IF WAKED UP WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
BETWEEN HONOLULU AND AUCKLAND
SEVEN SEA MILES WITHOUT GLASSES WHILE THE HARTFORD A BLACK SHIP WAS NEVER DISCOVERED AT ALL THOUGH SHE PASSED WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF I HAVE FOR YEARS WHILE A MEMBER OF THE GENERAL BOARD
BUT BEING WHOLLY UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING POSITIVE FOR GOOD MY FAVORITE QUOTATION FROM JOSH BILLINGS AGAIN APPLIES IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO BE A HARMLESS DOVE THAN A WISE SERPENT MY DUTY WAS TO COMBINE BOTH IDEALISM AND EFFICIENCY
ON MARCH FIRST NINETEEN O NINE THREE DAYS BEFORE LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TENNIS CABINET LUNCHED WITH ME AT THE WHITE HOUSE TENNIS CABINET WAS AN ELASTIC TERM AND OF COURSE MANY WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AT THE LUNCH WERE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON
I HAD TO CONVINCE THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF MY GOOD FAITH AND MOREOVER OF MY COMMON SENSE AND EFFICIENCY THEY WERE MOST OF THEM STRONG PARTISANS AND AN OUTRAGE HAD TO BE VERY REAL AND VERY GREAT TO SHAKE THEM EVEN PARTIALLY LOOSE FROM THEIR PARTY AFFILIATIONS MOREOVER
SHOWING THAT THE UPPER PORTION HAS RETREATED AT A MORE RAPID RATE THAN HAS THE BASE WHICH DO YOU INFER IS ON THE WHOLE THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE AGENT WEATHERING OR THE WAVE DRAW A SECTION OF A SEA CLIFF CUT IN WELL JOINTED ROCKS
AND REGIONAL INTRUSIONS AND THE ZONE OF CHANGE ABOUT THEM MAY BE SEVERAL MILES IN WIDTH IN THESE CHANGES HEATED WATERS AND VAPORS FROM THE MASSES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS UNDOUBTEDLY PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART WHICH WILL BE MORE STRONGLY ALTERED
THEY DRIVE THE WASTE BEFORE THEM LITTLE BY LITTLE ALONG THE SHORE THUS ON A NORTH SOUTH COAST WHERE THE PREDOMINANT STORMS ARE FROM THE NORTHEAST THERE WILL BE A MIGRATION OF SHORE DRIFT SOUTHWARDS
THE SHEET OF THE PALISADES OF THE HUDSON
UNTIL THE TALUS FALLEN FROM THE CLIFF IS GRADUALLY BUILT UP BENEATH THE SEA TO THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE WAVES DRAG BOTTOM UPON IT AND BREAK
ON THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY STRONG TIDES ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN INLETS AT INTERVALS OF FROM TWO TO TWENTY MILES IN SPITE OF A HEAVY ALONGSHORE DRIFT SAND REEFS ARE FORMED WHERE THE WATER IS SO SHALLOW NEAR SHORE
MARK BUT PAUSES IN THE PROCESS WHICH IS TO BRING ALL THE MATERIALS OF THE LAND NOW ABOVE SEA LEVEL TO REST UPON THE OCEAN BED
THE DEPRESSION AMOUNTING ON ITS SOUTHERN MARGIN TO AS MUCH AS SIX HUNDRED FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL DROWNED VALLEYS PENETRATE THE LAND IN LONG NARROW BAYS AND RUGGED DIVIDES PROJECT IN LONG NARROW LAND ARMS
THE PLACER DEPOSITS OF CALIFORNIA AND OTHER REGIONS ARE GOLD BEARING DEPOSITS OF GRAVEL AND SAND IN RIVER BEDS THE HEAVY GOLD IS APT TO BE FOUND MOSTLY NEAR OR UPON THE SOLID ROCK
SUBAQUEOUS PLAIN GENTLY SHELVING FROM THE LAND SINCE THE NEW SHORE LINE IS DRAWN ACROSS THIS EVEN SURFACE IT IS SIMPLE AND REGULAR
COAL SWAMPS STRETCHED FROM WESTERN MONTANA INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA THE MIDDLE CRETACEOUS THIS WAS A LAND EPOCH THE EARLY CRETACEOUS SEA RETIRED FROM TEXAS AND MEXICO
ON THE COAST OF SCOTLAND THE FORCE OF THE BLOWS STRUCK BY THE WAVES OF THE HEAVIEST STORMS HAS SOMETIMES EXCEEDED THREE TONS TO THE SQUARE FOOT BUT EVEN A CALM SEA CONSTANTLY CHAFES THE SHORE
WITH SOME ROCK SALT AND GYPSUM FOSSILS ARE VERY RARE AND NONE OF THEM MARINE HERE THEN LAY BROAD SHALLOW LAKES OFTEN SALT AND WARPED BASINS IN WHICH THE WASTE OF THE ADJACENT UPLANDS GATHERED
THE BRITISH ISLES THE TRIASSIC STRATA OF THE BRITISH ISLES ARE CONTINENTAL AND INCLUDE BRECCIA BEDS OF CEMENTED TALUS DEPOSITS OF SALT AND GYPSUM AND SANDSTONES WHOSE ROUNDED AND POLISHED GRAINS ARE THOSE OF THE WIND BLOWN SANDS OF DESERTS
AS A SEA CAVE IS DRILLED BACK INTO THE ROCK IT MAY ENCOUNTER A JOINT OR CREVICE OPENED TO THE SURFACE BY PERCOLATING WATER THE SHOCK OF THE WAVES SOON ENLARGES THIS TO A BLOWHOLE WHICH ONE MAY FIND ON THE BREEZY UPLAND
NO TRIASSIC SEDIMENTS ARE FOUND NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE EVER PRESENT HENCE THIS AREA WAS HIGH LAND SUFFERING EROSION DURING THE TRIASSIC ON EACH SIDE OF IT
WHEN THEREFORE DID THE DEFORMATION OF THE TRIASSIC ROCKS OCCUR WESTERN NORTH AMERICA TRIASSIC STRATA INFOLDED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS CARRY MARINE FOSSILS AND REACH A THICKNESS OF NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FEET
AND ITS RETREAT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY RAPID FOR THIS REASON ALONE SEA CLIFFS SELDOM OVERHANG BUT COMMONLY AS IN FIGURE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR SLOPE SEAWARD
AND THE OTHER THE LOW SANDY COAST WHERE THE WAVES BREAK USUALLY UPON THE SAND REEF TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF THESE TWO TYPES WE MUST KNOW THAT THE MEETING PLACE OF SEA AND LAND IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST
AS IT FALLS BACK THE AIR AS SUDDENLY EXPANDS ON LIGHTHOUSES HEAVILY BARRED DOORS HAVE BEEN BURST OUTWARD BY THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF THE AIR WITHIN
A SAND REEF IS SOON BEATEN UP BY THE WAVES AND FOR SOME TIME CONDITIONS WILL FAVOR ITS GROWTH THE LOSS OF SAND DRIVEN INTO THE LAGOON BEYOND AND OF THAT GROUND TO POWDER BY THE SURF AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA
AND TYING ISLANDS WITH SAND BARS TO THE MAINLAND IT BRIDGES THE LARGER BAYS WITH BAY BARS WHILE THEIR LENGTH IS BEING REDUCED AS THEIR INCLOSING PROMONTORIES ARE CUT BACK BY THE WAVES
THE RISE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET WOULD RESTORE THESE SUBMERGED PLAINS TO THE LAND THE CYCLE OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION
MADE OF PEBBLES WELL ROUNDED BY THE WEAR WHICH THEY HAVE SUFFERED SUCH BEACHES FORM A MILL WHOSE RAW MATERIAL IS CONSTANTLY SUPPLIED BY THE CLIFF THE BREAKERS OF STORMS SET IT IN MOTION TO A DEPTH OF SEVERAL FEET
THE ANGULAR SAND GRAINS OF VARIOUS MINERALS INTO WHICH PEBBLES ARE BROKEN BY THE WAVES ARE GROUND TOGETHER UNDER THE BEATING SURF AND ROUNDED AND THOSE OF THE SOFTER MINERALS ARE CRUSHED TO POWDER
THESE TRIASSIC ROCKS WHICH ARE CHIEFLY SANDSTONES HOLD NO MARINE FOSSILS AND HENCE WERE NOT LAID IN OPEN ARMS OF THE SEA BUT THEIR LAYERS ARE OFTEN RIPPLE MARKED AND CONTAIN MANY TRACKS OF REPTILES IMPRINTS OF RAINDROPS AND SOME FOSSIL WOOD
THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE CREEPING DOWN SLOPES IS WASHED TO THE SEA BY STREAMS TOGETHER WITH THE MATERIAL WHICH THE STREAMS HAVE WORN FROM THEIR BEDS AND THAT DISSOLVED BY UNDERGROUND WATERS
A HEAVY WHITE MINERAL ARE ABUNDANT IN MANY VEINS THE GOLD BEARING QUARTZ VEINS OF CALIFORNIA TRAVERSE THE METAMORPHIC SLATES OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS
OR AMONG THEM MAY BE FOUND PATCHES OF LITTLE CHANGE WHERE THEIR HISTORY MAYBE READ METAMORPHISM IS MOST COMMON AMONG ROCKS OF THE EARLIER GEOLOGICAL AGES AND MOST RARE AMONG ROCKS OF RECENT FORMATION
IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA THE LOWEST CRETACEOUS SERIES COMPRISES FRESH WATER FORMATIONS WHICH ARE TRACED FROM NANTUCKET ACROSS MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND LONG ISLAND AND THROUGH NEW JERSEY SOUTHWARD INTO GEORGIA THEY REST UNCONFORMABLY ON THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND THE OLDER ROCKS OF THE REGION
WHERE THE CHANGES ARE MOST PROFOUND ROCKS MAY BE WHOLLY MADE OVER IN STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION IN CONTACT METAMORPHISM THIN SHEETS OF MOLTEN ROCK PRODUCE LESS EFFECT THAN THICKER ONES THE STRONGEST HEAT EFFECTS ARE NATURALLY CAUSED BY BOSSES
AND NO ENERGY IS LEFT FOR AN EFFECTIVE ATTACK UPON THE LAND INDEED WITH AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF WASTE BROUGHT DOWN BY STREAMS THE LAND MAY BE BUILT OUT AND ENCROACH TEMPORARILY UPON THE SEA AND NOT UNTIL LONG DENUDATION HAS LOWERED THE LAND
FROM THE LAND LYING TO THE EAST CONTEMPORANEOUS LAVA FLOWS INTERBEDDED WITH THE STRATA SHOW THAT VOLCANIC ACTION ACCOMPANIED THE DOWNWARP AND THAT MOLTEN ROCK WAS DRIVEN UPWARD THROUGH FISSURES IN THE CRUST AND OUTSPREAD OVER THE SEA FLOOR IN SHEETS OF LAVA
WITH ITS INNER MARGIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE LOW TIDE SHOWS THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT BY SOME AGENT WHICH ACTS LIKE A HORIZONTAL SAW SET AT ABOUT SEA LEVEL THIS AGENT IS CLEARLY THE SURFACE AGITATION OF THE WATER
THE MESOZOIC COMPRISES THREE SYSTEMS THE TRIASSIC NAMED FROM ITS THREEFOLD DIVISION IN GERMANY THE JURASSIC WHICH IS WELL DISPLAYED IN THE JURA MOUNTAINS AND THE CRETACEOUS WHICH CONTAINS THE EXTENSIVE CHALK LATIN CRETA DEPOSITS OF EUROPE IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE SEA CANNOT CARRY OUT ITS INTENTION TO BRIDGE A BAY RIVERS DISCHARGING IN BAYS DEMAND OPEN WAY TO THE OCEAN STRONG TIDAL CURRENTS
WHERE A COASTAL REGION IS UNDERGOING SUBMERGENCE THE SHORE LINE MOVES LANDWARD THE HORIZONTAL PLANE OF THE SEA NOW INTERSECTS AN OLD LAND SURFACE ROUGHENED BY SUBAERIAL DENUDATION
WHERE HEADLANDS AND OUTLYING ISLANDS HAVE BEEN NIPPED BY THE WAVES AS YET LITTLE SHORE WASTE HAS BEEN FORMED THE COAST OF MAINE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS STAGE IN EARLY YOUTH ALL PROMONTORIES HAVE BEEN STRONGLY CLIFFED
OR THEIR CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS MAY RECOMBINE IN NEW MINERALS ENTIRELY CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE ROCK AS WHEN FOR EXAMPLE FELDSPAR RECRYSTALLIZES AS QUARTZ AND MICA EARLY STAGES OF METAMORPHISM ARE SEEN IN SLATE
THE PROCESS HOWEVER IS A SLOW ONE AND IF WE STUDY THESE SAND GRAINS UNDER A LENS WE MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THOUGH THEIR CORNERS AND EDGES HAVE BEEN BLUNTED THEY ARE YET FAR FROM THE SPHERICAL FORM OF THE PEBBLES FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED
THE RATE AT WHICH A SHORE RECEDES DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS IN SOFT OR INCOHERENT ROCKS EXPOSED TO VIOLENT STORMS THE RETREAT IS SO RAPID AS TO BE EASILY MEASURED THE COAST OF YORKSHIRE ENGLAND
GNEISS IS THE GENERAL NAME UNDER WHICH ARE COMPRISED COARSELY FOLIATED ROCKS BANDED WITH IRREGULAR LAYERS OF FELDSPAR AND OTHER MINERALS
FOR ITS SEDIMENTS ARE OVERLAIN UNCONFORMABLY BY FORMATIONS OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS SO LONG WAS THE TIME GAP BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT NO SPECIES FOUND IN THE ONE OCCURS IN THE OTHER THE UPPER CRETACEOUS
THE SEA CLIFF WEATHERS MORE RAPIDLY AS A RULE THAN DO ROCK LEDGES INLAND IT IS ABUNDANTLY WET WITH SPRAY ALONG ITS BASE THE GROUND WATER OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND FINDS ITS NATURAL OUTLET IN SPRINGS WHICH UNDER MINE IT
THE SIERRA DEFORMATION EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE SILURIAN THE SIERRA TROUGH HAD BEEN SINKING THOUGH NO DOUBT WITH HALTS AND INTERRUPTIONS UNTIL IT CONTAINED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET OF SEDIMENT
IT IS WIDESPREAD IN NEW ENGLAND AND ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS TALC SCHIST CONSISTS OF QUARTZ AND TALC A LIGHT COLORED MAGNESIAN MINERAL OF GREASY FEEL AND SO SOFT THAT IT CAN BE SCRATCHED WITH THE THUMB NAIL
METAMORPHISM AND MINERAL VEINS UNDER THE ACTION OF INTERNAL AGENCIES ROCKS OF ALL KINDS MAY BE RENDERED HARDER
IN MANY CASES HOWEVER THE EARLY HISTORY OF A METAMORPHIC ROCK CAN BE DECIPHERED FOSSILS NOT WHOLLY OBLITERATED MAY PROVE IT ORIGINALLY WATER LAID SCHISTS MAY CONTAIN ROLLED OUT PEBBLES
PENNSYLVANIA AND FARTHER SOUTHWEST THE LOWEST STRATA OF THE NEXT PERIOD THE CRETACEOUS
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COAST OF MAINE ARE DUE CHIEFLY TO THE FACT THAT A MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF HARD ROCKS ONCE WORN TO A PENEPLAIN AND AFTER A SUBSEQUENT ELEVATION DEEPLY DISSECTED BY NORTH SOUTH VALLEYS HAS SUBSIDED
HENCE DURING THIS LONG INTERVAL THE LAND STOOD HIGH THE COAST WAS FARTHER OUT THAN NOW
IN ITS WARM AND QUIET WATERS LIMESTONES ACCUMULATED TO A DEPTH OF FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET IN TEXAS AND OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND FEET IN MEXICO MEANWHILE THE LOWLANDS WHERE THE GREAT PLAINS ARE NOW RECEIVED CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS
THUS IN SOLUBLE ROCKS SUCH AS LIMESTONES JOINTS ENLARGED BY PERCOLATING WATER ARE SOMETIMES FILLED WITH METALLIFEROUS DEPOSITS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
IS DARK WITH GRAINS OF A NUMBER OF MINERALS SOFTER THAN QUARTZ THE WHITE SAND OF OTHER BEACHES AS THOSE OF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA IS ALMOST WHOLLY COMPOSED OF QUARTZ GRAINS
WHOSE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE LAND DRAW A DIAGRAM OF A SEA CLIFF WHERE THE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE SEA SEA CAVES THE WAVE DOES NOT MERELY BATTER THE FACE OF THE CLIFF
THAT INSTEAD OF TURNING IN IT SETS DIRECTLY ACROSS TOWARD THE OPPOSITE HEADLAND THE WASTE IS CARRIED OUT FROM SHORE INTO THE DEEPER WATERS OF THE BAY MOUTH WHERE IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE BREAKING WAVES AND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
THE SHORE LINE IS IRREGULAR AND INDENTED IN PROPORTION TO THE RELIEF OF THE LAND AND THE AMOUNT OF THE SUBMERGENCE WHICH THE LAND HAS SUFFERED IT FOLLOWS UP PARTIALLY SUBMERGED VALLEYS FORMING BAYS
SHOWING THEIR DERIVATION FROM A CONGLOMERATE DIKES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS MAY BE FOLLOWED INTO A REGION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOLIATED BY PRESSURE THE MOST THOROUGHLY METAMORPHOSED ROCKS MAY SOMETIMES BE TRACED OUT INTO UNALTERED SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS ROCKS
THEIR ENERGY IS DISSIPATED IN MOVING SHORE DRIFT HITHER AND THITHER AND IN ABRADING THE BENCH WHEN THEY DRAG BOTTOM UPON IT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BENCH IS DEEPENED BY TIDAL CURRENTS AND THE DRAG OF WAVES
AND SWEEP IT OUT TO SEA PLAINS OF MARINE ABRASION
DEPOSITING THEIR LOAD CONTINUALLY AT THE POINT OF THE SPUR AN EMBANKMENT IS THUS CONSTRUCTED IN MUCH THE SAME MANNER AS A RAILWAY FILL WHICH WHILE IT IS BUILDING SERVES AS A ROADWAY ALONG WHICH THE DIRT FROM AN ADJACENT CUT IS CARTED
MORE OR LESS THICKLY VENEERED WITH SAND AND SHINGLE AT LOW TIDE ITS INNER MARGIN IS LAID BARE BUT AT HIGH TIDE IT IS COVERED WHOLLY AND THE SEA WASHES THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS A NOTCH OF WHICH THE SEA CLIFF
THE DUMP IS GRADUALLY BUILT TO THE SURFACE AS A STUBBY SPUR POINTING ACROSS THE BAY AND AS IT REACHES THE ZONE OF WAVE ACTION CURRENT AND WAVE CAN NOW COMBINE TO CARRY SHORE DRIFT ALONG IT
OUTFLOWS OF LAVA OCCURRED ALONG THE WASATCH THE LACCOLITHS OF THE HENRY MOUNTAINS WERE FORMED WHILE THE GREAT MASSES OF IGNEOUS ROCK WHICH CONSTITUTE THE CORES OF THE SPANISH PEAKS AND OTHER WESTERN MOUNTAINS WERE THRUST UP AMID THE STRATA
IN THE SOUTHERN BASINS AS ABOUT RICHMOND VIRGINIA ARE VALUABLE BEDS OF COAL WHAT WAS THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THESE AREAS WHEN THE COAL WAS BEING FORMED INTERBEDDED WITH THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES ARE CONTEMPORANEOUS LAVA BEDS WHICH WERE FED FROM DIKES
THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES ARE VOLUMINOUS MEASURING AT LEAST A MILE IN THICKNESS AND ARE LARGELY OF COARSE WASTE
MOREOVER IT IS UNPROTECTED BY ANY SHIELD OF TALUS FRAGMENTS OF ROCK AS THEY FALL FROM ITS FACE ARE BATTERED TO PIECES BY THE WAVES AND SWEPT OUT TO SEA THE CLIFF IS THUS LEFT EXPOSED TO THE ATTACK OF THE WEATHER
AT THE FOOT OF SEA CLIFFS WHERE THE WAVES ARE POUNDING HARDEST ONE COMMONLY FINDS THE ROCK BENCH STREWN ON ITS INNER MARGIN WITH LARGE STONES DISLODGED BY THE WAVES AND BY THE WEATHER
HORNBLENDE SCHIST RESULTING IN MANY CASES FROM THE FOLIATION OF BASIC IGNEOUS ROCKS IS MADE OF FOLIA OF HORNBLENDE ALTERNATING WITH BANDS OF QUARTZ AND FELDSPAR HORNBLENDE SCHIST IS COMMON OVER LARGE AREAS IN THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION
OF THE BREAKING WAVES THE BAY HEAD BEACH AS THE WASTE DERIVED FROM THE WEAR OF WAVES AND THAT BROUGHT IN BY STREAMS IS TRAILED ALONG A COAST IT ASSUMES UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS A NUMBER OF DISTINCT FORMS
AND VARIOUS RANGES OF THE ROCKIES IN COLORADO AND OTHER STATES WERE UPRIDGED HOWEVER SLOWLY THESE DEFORMATIONS WERE EFFECTED THEY WERE NO DOUBT ACCOMPANIED BY WORLD SHAKING EARTHQUAKES AND IT IS KNOWN THAT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS TOOK PLACE ON A MAGNIFICENT SCALE
THERE NOW BEGAN ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EVENTS IN ALL GEOLOGICAL HISTORY THE GREAT CRETACEOUS SUBSIDENCE ITS EARLIER WARPINGS WERE RECORDED IN CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS WIDE SHEETS OF SANDSTONE SHALE AND SOME COAL WHICH WERE SPREAD FROM TEXAS TO BRITISH COLUMBIA
WEATHERING OF SEA CLIFFS THE SEA CLIFF FURNISHES THE WEAPONS FOR ITS OWN DESTRUCTION THEY ARE BROKEN FROM IT NOT ONLY BY THE WAVE BUT ALSO BY THE WEATHER INDEED
THE TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC EASTERN NORTH AMERICA THE SEDIMENTARY RECORD INTERRUPTED BY THE APPALACHIAN DEFORMATION WAS NOT RENEWED IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA UNTIL LATE IN THE TRIASSIC
ALL SHORES ARE SWEPT ALSO BY CURRENTS PRODUCED BY WINDS AND TIDES THESE ARE USUALLY FAR TOO GENTLE TO TRANSPORT OF THEMSELVES THE COARSE MATERIALS OF WHICH BEACHES ARE MADE
OTHER FACTORS HOWEVER HAVE PLAYED IMPORTANT PARTS ROCK CRUSHING DEVELOPS HEAT AND ALLOWS A FREER CIRCULATION OF HEATED WATERS AND VAPORS THUS CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE GREATLY QUICKENED MINERALS ARE DISSOLVED AND REDEPOSITED IN NEW POSITIONS
ROCKS BENEATH A LAVA FLOW OR IN CONTACT WITH IGNEOUS INTRUSIONS ARE FOUND TO BE METAMORPHOSED TO VARIOUS DEGREES BY THE HEAT OF THE COOLING MASS THE ADJACENT STRATA MAY BE CHANGED ONLY IN COLOR HARDNESS AND TEXTURE
THUS NEXT TO A DIKE BITUMINOUS COAL MAY BE BAKED TO COKE OR ANTHRACITE AND CHALK AND LIMESTONE TO CRYSTALLINE MARBLE SANDSTONE MAY BE CONVERTED INTO QUARTZITE AND SHALE INTO ARGILLITE A COMPACT MASSIVE CLAY ROCK
AND ESPECIALLY BY THE DRAG OF SEDIMENTS TO THE REEF BY THE WAVES AS THEY DEEPEN THE SEA FLOOR ON ITS SEAWARD SIDE MEANWHILE THE LAGOON GRADUALLY FILLS WITH WASTE FROM THE REEF AND FROM THE LAND
THE MINERALS OF VEINS ARE THEREFORE CONSTANTLY BEING DISSOLVED ALONG THEIR UPPER PORTIONS AND CARRIED DOWN THE FISSURES BY GROUND WATER TO LOWER LEVELS WHERE THEY ARE REDEPOSITED
WE MAY INFER THAT AS THE DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINENT CONTINUED THE SEA CAME IN FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COAST LANDS AND THE PLAINS WORN LOW DURING THE PREVIOUS EPOCHS UPPER CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS SHOW THAT SOUTH OF NEW ENGLAND
THE PALEOZOIC ROCKS ARE BURIED QUITE GENERALLY FROM VIEW
AND THE ROCK BENCH ARE THE TWO SIDES HAS BEEN CUT ALONG THE SHORE WAVES
AND UNDER A VIGOROUS ATTACK OF THE SEA THE SHORE OF OPEN BAYS MAY BE CUT BACK ALSO SEA STACKS AND ROCKY ISLETS CAVES AND COVES MAKE THE SHORE MINUTELY RAGGED THE IRREGULARITY OF THE COAST DUE TO DEPRESSION
MAY BE METAMORPHOSED INTO SCHISTS BY CRUSHING AND SHEARING LIMESTONES HOWEVER ARE METAMORPHOSED BY PRESSURE INTO MARBLE THE GRAINS OF CARBONATE OF LIME RECRYSTALLIZING FREELY TO INTERLOCKING CRYSTALS OF CALCITE
IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN TEN MILLION YEARS TO PARE A STRIP ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE FROM THE MARGIN OF A CONTINENT A TIME SUFFICIENT AT THE RATE AT WHICH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NOW BEING WORN AWAY
THE LONG BELT LYING WEST OF THE ANCIENT AXES OF THE COLORADO ISLANDS AND EAST OF THE GREAT BASIN LAND HAD BEEN AN AREA OF DEPOSITION FOR MANY AGES AND IN ITS SUBSIDING TROUGHS PALEOZOIC AND MESOZOIC SEDIMENTS HAD GATHERED TO THE DEPTH OF MANY THOUSAND FEET
AT THE CLOSE OF THE JURASSIC IT YIELDED TO LATERAL PRESSURE AND THE VAST PILE OF STRATA WAS CRUMPLED AND UPHEAVED INTO TOWERING MOUNTAINS THE MESOZOIC MUDS WERE HARDENED AND SQUEEZED INTO SLATES THE ROCKS WERE WRENCHED AND BROKEN
THE SEA IS SAWING ITS EDGES TO WAVE BASE I E THE LOWEST LIMIT OF THE WAVE'S EFFECTIVE WEAR THE WIDENED ROCK BENCH FORMS WHEN UPLIFTED A PLAIN OF MARINE ABRASION
AS THE SEA DRIVES ITS TUNNELS AND OPEN DRIFTS INTO THE CLIFF IT BREAKS THROUGH BEHIND THE INTERVENING PORTIONS AND LEAVES THEM ISOLATED AS STACKS MUCH AS MONUMENTS ARE DETACHED FROM INLAND ESCARPMENTS BY THE WEATHER
GRINDING THE PEBBLES TOGETHER WITH A CLATTER TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR OF THE SURF IN SUCH A ROCK CRUSHER THE LIFE OF A PEBBLE IS SHORT WHERE SHIPS HAVE STRANDED ON OUR ATLANTIC COAST WITH CARGOES OF HARD BURNED BRICK OR OF COAL
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST EFFECT OF WAVE WEAR WAS TO INCREASE THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE SHORE IT SOONER OR LATER RECTIFIES IT MAKING IT SIMPLE AND SMOOTH NORTHWESTERN FRANCE MAY BE CITED AS AN UPLAND PLAIN DISSECTED AND DEPRESSED
SHORE DRIFT BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACHES ABOUT AS FAST AS FORMED THE WASTE OF THE SEA CLIFF IS SWEPT BOTH ALONG THE SHORE AND OUT TO SEA
WHERE A COAST LAND EMERGES THE SHORE LINE MOVES SEAWARD WHERE IT IS BEING SUBMERGED THE SHORE LINE ADVANCES ON THE LAND SHORES OF ELEVATION THE RETREAT OF THE SEA
SHORES OF ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION OUR STUDIES HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT TO OUR NOTICE TWO DISTINCT FORMS OF STRAND LINES ONE THE HIGH ROCKY COAST CUT BACK TO CLIFFS BY THE ATTACK OF THE WAVES
THE ROCKS ABOUT A CLOSED DIKE IN WHICH LAVA BEGAN TO COOL AS SOON AS IT FILLED THE FISSURE OR THE ROCKS ABOUT A DIKE WHICH OPENED ON THE SURFACE AND THROUGH WHICH THE MOLTEN ROCK FLOWED FOR SOME TIME TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PART PLAYED BY HEATED WATERS
SAND REEFS ON LOW COASTS WHERE SHALLOW WATER EXTENDS SOME DISTANCE OUT THE HIGHWAY OF SHORE DRIFT LIES ALONG A LOW NARROW RIDGE
BUT THE CHANGE IS OFTEN SO COMPLETE THAT NO TRACE OF THEIR ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION REMAINS TO TELL WHETHER THE ROCKS FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED WERE SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS OR TO WHAT VARIETY OF EITHER OF THESE CLASSES THEY BELONGED
AFTER COVES ARE CUT BACK A SHORT DISTANCE BY THE WAVES THE HEADLANDS COME TO PROTECT THEM AS WITH BREAKWATERS AND PREVENT THEIR INDEFINITE RETREAT THE SHORE TAKES A CURVE OF EQUILIBRIUM
WHICH RENDER ROCKS LESS COHERENT BY DISSOLVING THEIR SOLUBLE PARTS AND BREAKING DOWN THEIR CRYSTALLINE GRAINS CONTACT METAMORPHISM
PROVIDED THAT THE ROCK ABOVE IS COHERENT ENOUGH TO FORM A ROOF OTHERWISE AN OPEN CHASM RESULTS BLOWHOLES AND SEA ARCHES
COMPARED WITH SUBAERIAL DENUDATION MARINE ABRASION IS A COMPARATIVELY FEEBLE AGENT AT THE RATE OF FIVE FEET PER CENTURY A HIGHER RATE THAN OBTAINS ON THE YOUTHFUL ROCKY COAST OF BRITAIN
EXAMPLES OF THIS STAGE ARE THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND AND THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR SAN FRANCISCO LATER YOUTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF SHORE WASTE
PERHAPS NOW AND THEN THE BASINS BECAME LONG BRACKISH ESTUARIES WHOSE LOW SHORES WERE SWEPT BY THE INCOMING TIDE AND WERE IN TURN LEFT BARE AT ITS RETREAT TO RECEIVE THE RAIN PRINTS OF PASSING SHOWERS AND THE TRACKS OF THE TROOPS OF REPTILES WHICH INHABITED THESE VALLEYS
WHAT EFFECT HAVE THESE SHEETS ON THE PRESENT TOPOGRAPHY AND WHY ASSUMING THAT THE TRIASSIC DEFORMATION WENT ON MORE RAPIDLY THAN DENUDATION WHAT WAS ITS EFFECT ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TIME ARE THERE ANY OF ITS RESULTS REMAINING IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF TO DAY
AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THEIR SOURCE THEREFORE PEBBLE BEACHES GIVE PLACE TO BEACHES OF SAND WHICH OCCUPY THE MORE SHELTERED REACHES OF THE SHORE SAND BEACHES
METAMORPHIC ROCKS OCCUR WIDE SPREAD IN MANY REGIONS OFTEN HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES IN AREA WHERE SUCH EXTENSIVE CHANGES CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY IGNEOUS INTRUSIONS SUCH ARE THE DISSECTED CORES OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS AS THE ALPS
TO BE DUMPED AT THE END WHEN THE EMBANKMENT IS COMPLETED IT BRIDGES THE BAY WITH A HIGHWAY ALONG WHICH SHORE DRIFT NOW MOVES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND BECOMES A BAY BAR INCOMPLETE BAY BARS
THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC SOMEWHAT OVERLAPPED THE CRYSTALLINE ROCKS OF THE PIEDMONT BELT AND SPREAD THEIR WASTE OVER THE SUBMERGED COASTAL PLAIN THE GULF OF MEXICO AGAIN COVERED THE MISSISSIPPI EMBAYMENT
TERMED THE SAND REEF SEPARATED FROM THE LAND BY A NARROW STRETCH OF SHALLOW WATER CALLED THE LAGOON AT INTERVALS THE REEF IS HELD OPEN BY INLETS GAPS THROUGH WHICH THE TIDE FLOWS AND EBBS
AND BY WHICH THE WATER OF STREAMS FINDS WAY TO THE SEA NO FINER EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF SHORE LINE IS TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD THAN THE COAST OF TEXAS FROM NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE A
BELOW WAVE BASE BASAL CONGOLMERATES AS THE SEA MARCHES ACROSS THE LAND DURING A SLOW SUBMERGENCE THE PLATFORM IS COVERED WITH SHEETS OF SEA LAID SEDIMENTS
WHILE AN OCCASIONAL BED OF SHALE IS FILLED WITH THE REMAINS OF FISHES WE MAY CONCEIVE THEN OF THE CONNECTICUT VALLEY
REACHING AS FAR NORTH AS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND EXTENDED OVER TEXAS A MEDITERRANEAN SEA NOW STRETCHED FROM THE GULF TO THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND FROM CENTRAL IOWA TO THE EASTERN SHORE OF THE GREAT BASIN LAND AT ABOUT THE LONGITUDE OF SALT LAKE CITY THE COLORADO MOUNTAINS RISING FROM IT IN A CHAIN OF ISLANDS
DRAWS ITS EVEN CURVE FOR A HUNDRED MILES TO CORPUS CHRISTI PASS AND THE REEFS ARE BUT SELDOM INTERRUPTED BY INLETS AS FAR NORTH AS GALVESTON HARBOR ON THIS COAST THE TIDES ARE VARIABLE AND EXCEPTIONALLY WEAK
AS IT WAS RELEASED FROM PRESSURE WHEN A PARTIAL VACUUM WAS FORMED BY THE REFLUENCE OF THE WAVE WHERE A CREVICE IS FILLED WITH WATER THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE BLOW OF THE WAVE IS TRANSMITTED BY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO THE SIDES OF THE FISSURE
MICA SCHIST THE MOST COMMON OF SCHISTS AND IN FACT OF ALL METAMORPHIC ROCKS IS COMPOSED OF MICA AND QUARTZ IN ALTERNATING WAVY FOLIA ALL GRADATIONS BETWEEN IT AND PHYLLITE MAY BE TRACED
OR FROM THE SEDIMENTARY PALEOZOIC ROCKS WHICH HAD BEEN FOLDED INTO MOUNTAINS DURING THE APPALACHIAN DEFORMATION IF FROM THE FORMER WAS THE DRAINAGE OF THE NORTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN REGION THEN AS NOW EASTWARD AND SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE ATLANTIC
IN THE CONSTANTLY DEEPENING WATER AS THE LAND SUBSIDES SUCH BASAL CONGLOMERATES ARE NOT UNCOMMON AMONG THE ANCIENT ROCKS OF THE LAND AND WE MAY KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROUNDED PEBBLES AND LARGER STONES
AND EVEN THEIR MINUTE GRAINS AS ONE MAY SEE WITH A MICROSCOPE HAVE OFTEN BEEN PUCKERED BROKEN AND CRUSHED TO POWDER IT IS TO THESE MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS AND STRAINS WHICH THE ROCKS HAVE SUFFERED IN EVERY PART THAT WE MAY ATTRIBUTE THEIR METAMORPHISM
THESE FEW EXAMPLES MUST SUFFICE OF THE GREAT CLASS OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS AS WE HAVE SEEN
THE BAYS INTO WHICH THEY EMPTY BY THESE STEPS A COAST GRADUALLY ADVANCES TO MATURITY THE STAGE WHEN THE IRREGULARITIES DUE TO DEPRESSION HAVE BEEN EFFACED WHEN OUTLYING ISLANDS FORMED BY SUBSIDENCE HAVE BEEN PLANED AWAY
INCLOSING A SHALLOW POND OR MARSH THE BAY BAR AS THE STREAM OF SHORE DRIFT REACHES THE MOUTH OF A BAY OF SOME SIZE IT OFTEN OCCURS
THE MESOZOIC ERA WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS
THESE FOLIA CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LAMINAE OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BY THEIR LENTICULAR FORM AND LACK OF CONTINUITY AND ESPECIALLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY CONSIST OF PLATY CRYSTALLINE GRAINS AND NOT OF PARTICLES ROUNDED BY WEAR
THE STEAMBOAT SPRINGS NEVADA FURNISH EXAMPLES OF MINERAL VEINS IN PROCESS OF FORMATION THE STEAMING WATER RISES THROUGH FISSURES IN VOLCANIC ROCKS AND IS NOW DEPOSITING IN THE RIFTS A VEIN STONE OF QUARTZ
ON MANY COASTS THE LAND FRONTS THE OCEAN IN A LINE OF CLIFFS TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFFS THERE LEAD DOWN VALLEYS AND RIDGES CARVED BY RUNNING WATER WHICH IF EXTENDED
RUNNING WATER SWEEPS FRAGMENTS OF VARIOUS SIZES ALONG ITS CHANNELS HOLDING THEM WITH A LOOSE HAND GLACIAL ICE GRINDS THE STONES OF ITS GROUND MORAINE AGAINST THE UNDERLYING ROCK
FOR VARIOUS REASONS THESE SUBSTANCES STANCES ARE DEPOSITED IN THE VEIN AS ORES AND VEIN STONES ON RISING THROUGH THE FISSURE THE WATER COOLS AND LOSES PRESSURE AND ITS CAPACITY TO HOLD MINERALS IN SOLUTION IS THEREFORE LESSENED
ALL WRECKS OF THE LAND TESTIFYING TO ITS RETREAT BEFORE THE INCESSANT ATTACK OF THE WAVES COVES WHERE ZONES OF SOFT OR CLOSELY JOINTED ROCK OUTCROP ALONG A SHORE
IN OUR STUDY OF UNDERGROUND WATER WE LEARNED THAT IT IS EVERYWHERE CIRCULATING THROUGH THE PERMEABLE ROCKS OF THE CRUST DESCENDING TO PROFOUND DEPTHS UNDER THE ACTION OF GRAVITY AND AGAIN DRIVEN TO THE SURFACE BY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
ALTHOUGH THE MESOZOIC ERA IS SHORTER THAN THE PALEOZOIC AS MEASURED BY THE THICKNESS OF THEIR STRATA YET ITS DURATION MUST BE RECKONED IN MILLIONS OF YEARS
WHY DO METAMORPHIC ROCKS APPEAR ON THE SURFACE TO DAY MINERAL VEINS IN REGIONS OF FOLDED AND BROKEN ROCKS FISSURES ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND TO BE FILLED WITH SHEETS OF CRYSTALLINE MINERALS DEPOSITED FROM SOLUTION BY UNDERGROUND WATER
BESIDES AS DIFFERENT CURRENTS MEET IN THE FISSURE SOME ASCENDING SOME DESCENDING AND SOME COMING IN FROM THE SIDES THE CHEMICAL REACTION OF THESE VARIOUS WEAK SOLUTIONS UPON ONE ANOTHER AND UPON THE WALLS OF THE VEIN PRECIPITATES THE MINERALS OF VEIN STUFFS AND ORES
VIGOROUSLY THEY NOW WEAR IT BACK AND DRIVING THE SHORE LINE ACROSS THE LAGOON OR MEADOW CUT A LINE OF LOW CLIFFS ON THE MAINLAND SUCH A SHORE IS THAT OF GASCONY IN SOUTHWESTERN FRANCE
HOW SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES IT IS UNDER THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CURRENTS THAT SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES SLOWLY ALONG A COAST WHERE WAVES STRIKE A COAST OBLIQUELY
AND EVEN THE SEA HAS TAKEN INTO SOLUTION AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF GOLD AND OTHER METALS BUT IN THIS WIDELY DIFFUSED CONDITION THEY ARE WHOLLY USELESS TO MAN THE CONCENTRATION WHICH HAS MADE THEM AVAILABLE IS DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF MANY AGENCIES
THE TRIASSIC ROCKS ARE MAINLY RED SANDSTONES OFTEN FELDSPATHIC OR ARKOSE WITH SOME CONGLOMERATES AND SHALES CONSIDERING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FELDSPATHIC MATERIAL IN THESE ROCKS DO YOU INFER THAT THEY WERE DERIVED FROM THE ADJACENT CRYSTALLINE AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS OF THE OLDLAND OF APPALACHIA
AND THE WORN DOWN BASES OF ANCIENT RANGES AS IN NEW ENGLAND LARGE AREAS IN THE PIEDMONT BELT AND THE LAURENTIAN PENEPLAIN IN THESE REGIONS THE ROCKS HAVE YIELDED TO IMMENSE PRESSURE
THE LATTER CONTAINING THREADS AND GRAINS OF NATIVE GOLD
THE CURRENT CARRIES THEM A STEP FORWARD ON THEIR WAY THE CURRENT CANNOT LIFT AND THE WAVE CANNOT CARRY BUT TOGETHER THE TWO TRANSPORT THE WASTE ALONG THE SHORE THE ROAD OF SHORE DRIFT IS THEREFORE THE ZONE
AND IS BORDERED ON THE ONE SIDE BY SHALLOW WATER GRADUALLY DEEPENING SEAWARD AND ON THE OTHER BY LOW LAND COMPOSED OF MATERIAL WHICH HAS NOT YET THOROUGHLY CONSOLIDATED TO FIRM ROCK
EARTH MOVEMENTS FRACTURING DEEPLY THE ROCKS OF THE CRUST THE INTRUSION OF HEATED MASSES THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS HAVE ALL COOPERATED IN THE CONCENTRATION OF THE METALS OF MINERAL VEINS
AS AN AGENT OF DESTRUCTION AND WE MUST FIRST TAKE UP ITS WORK IN EROSION BEFORE WE CONSIDER HOW IT TRANSPORTS AND DEPOSITS THE WASTE OF THE LAND SEA EROSION THE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH
STORM WAVES CAN THEREFORE ALWAYS RIDE IN TO THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS AND ATTACK THEM WITH FULL FORCE SHORE WASTE CANNOT IMPEDE THE ONSET OF THE WAVES FOR IT IS CONTINUALLY WASHED OUT IN DEEPER WATER
NO DOUBT IT IS NOW IN PROGRESS WHERE DEEP BURIED SEDIMENTS ARE INVADED BY HEAT EITHER FROM INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS MASSES OR FROM THE EARTH'S INTERIOR
AND AS THE SEA CLIFF RETREATS THESE REMNANT MASSES MAY BE LEFT BEHIND AS ROCKY ISLETS THUS THE ROCK BENCH IS OFTEN SET WITH STACKS ISLETS IN ALL STAGES OF DESTRUCTION AND SUNKEN REEFS
AND THUS DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF WASTE FROM IT MAY THE WAVES BE ABLE TO CUT THROUGH THE SAND REEF AND THUS THE COAST REACH MATURITY SHORES OF DEPRESSION
THE GRAINS ARE SMALL AND IN WATER THEY HAVE LOST ABOUT HALF THEIR WEIGLIT IN AIR THE BLOWS WHICH THEY STRIKE ONE ANOTHER ARE THEREFORE WEAK BESIDES EACH GRAIN OF SAND OF THE WET BEACH IS PROTECTED BY A CUSHION OF WATER FROM THE BLOWS OF ITS NEIGHBORS
HUDSON BAY AND THE NORTH THE BALTIC AND THE YELLOW SEAS ARE EXAMPLES WHERE THE SINKING OF THE LAND HAS BROUGHT THE SEA IN OVER LOW PLAINS OF LARGE EXTENT THUS DEEPLY INDENTING THE CONTINENTAL OUT LINE
REACHING FROM GEORGIA NORTHWESTWARD INTO TENNESSEE AND THENCE ACROSS INTO ARKANSAS AND SOUTHWARD INTO TEXAS IN THE SOUTHWEST THE SUBSIDENCE CONTINUED UNTIL THE TRANSGRESSING SEA COVERED MOST OF MEXICO AND TEXAS AND EXTENDED A GULF NORTHWARD INTO KANSAS
FOR SUBAERIAL DENUDATION TO LOWER THE LANDS OF THE GLOBE TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA SLOW SUBMERGENCE FAVORS THE CUTTING OF A WIDE ROCK BENCH THE WATER CONTINUALLY DEEPENS UPON THE BENCH
IS FOR A WHILE INCREASED BY DIFFERENTIAL WAVE WEAR ON HARDER AND SOFTER ROCKS THE ROCK BENCH IS STILL NARROW SHORE WASTE THOUGH BEING PRODUCED IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS FOR THE MOST PART SWEPT INTO DEEPER WATER AND BURIED OUT OF SIGHT
AND NOW FROM MEXICO WELL NIGH TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN THIS BELT YIELDED TO LATERAL PRESSURE THE CRETACEOUS LIMESTONES OF MEXICO WERE FOLDED INTO LOFTY MOUNTAINS A MASSIVE RANGE WAS UPFOLDED WHERE THE WASATCH MOUNTAINS NOW ARE
DO THE TRIASSIC AREAS NOW STAND HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND WHY HOW DO THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND SHALES COMPARE IN HARDNESS WITH THE IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS ABOUT THEM
WHEN SWEPT INTO THE HEAD OF A SHELTERED BAY IT CONSTITUTES THE BAY HEAD BEACH BY THE HIGHEST STORM WAVES THE BEACH IS OFTEN BUILT HIGHER THAN THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT AND FORMS A DAM
AND WHEN THE SHORE LINE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BACK BEHIND THE FORMER BAY HEADS THE SEA NOW ATTACKS THE LAND MOST EFFECTIVELY ALONG A CONTINUOUS AND FAIRLY STRAIGHT LINE OF CLIFFS
LAVAS CONTAIN MINUTE PERCENTAGES OF VARIOUS METALLIC COMPOUNDS AND NO DOUBT THIS WAS THE CASE ALSO WITH THE IGNEOUS ROCKS WHICH FORMED THE ORIGINAL EARTH CRUST BY THE EROSION OF THE IGNEOUS ROCKS THE METALS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED AMONG SEDIMENTARY STRATA
WITH THE CLOSE OF THE PERMIAN THE WORLD OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE HAD SO CHANGED THAT THE LINE IS DRAWN HERE WHICH MARKS THE END OF THE OLD ORDER AND THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AND SEPARATES THE PALEOZOIC FROM THE SUCCEEDING ERA THE MESOZOIC THE MIDDLE AGE OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY
LIKE A SKILLFUL QUARRYMAN IT INSERTS WEDGES IN ALL NATURAL FISSURES SUCH AS JOINTS AND USES EXPLOSIVE FORCES AS A WAVE FLAPS AGAINST A CREVICE IT COMPRESSES THE AIR WITHIN WITH THE SUDDEN STROKE
NOW FISSURES WHEREVER THEY OCCUR FORM THE TRUNK CHANNELS OF THE UNDERGROUND CIRCULATION WATER DESCENDS FROM THE SURFACE ALONG THESE RIFTS IT MOVES LATERALLY FROM EITHER SIDE TO THE FISSURE PLANE
MUCH WASTE IS BROUGHT IN BY RIVERS THE MATURITY OF SUCH A COAST MAY BE LONG DELAYED THE WASTE FROM THE LAND KEEPS THE SEA SHALLOW OFFSHORE AND CONSTANTLY RENEWS THE SAND REEF THE ENERGY OF THE WAVES IS CONSUMED IN HANDLING SHORE DRIFT
PROLONGED SEAWARD BY ISLANDS REPRESENTING THE HIGH PORTIONS OF THEIR EXTREMITIES OF THIS EXCEEDINGLY RAGGED SHORE THERE ARE SAID TO BE TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM THE NEW BRUNSWICK BOUNDARY AS FAR WEST AS PORTLAND
JUST AS GROUND WATER SEEPS THROUGH THE SURROUNDING ROCKS FROM EVERY DIRECTION TO A WELL AND IT ASCENDS THROUGH THESE NATURAL WATER WAYS AS IN AN ARTESIAN WELL WHENEVER THEY INTERSECT AN AQUIFER IN WHICH WATER IS UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
NEW MINERALS MAY ALSO BE DEVELOPED IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THERE MAY BE PRODUCED CRYSTALS OF MICA AND OF GARNET A MINERAL AS HARD AS QUARTZ COMMONLY OCCURRING IN RED TWELVE SIDED CRYSTALS
OR LEAVE IT FOR STREAMS TO TRANSPORT TO THE SAME GOAL ALL DEPOSITS MADE ON THE LAND SUCH AS THE FLOOD PLAINS OF RIVERS THE SILTS OF LAKE BEDS DUNE SANDS AND SHEETS OF GLACIAL DRIFT
AS THE ROOF OF THE CAVE THUS BREAKS DOWN IN THE REAR THERE MAY REMAIN IN FRONT FOR A WHILE A SEA ARCH SIMILAR TO THE NATURAL BRIDGES OF LAND CAVERNS STACKS AND WAVE CUT ISLANDS
LOWEST OF THESE IS A CONGLOMERATE THE BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACH WIDENED INDEFINITELY BY THE RETREAT OF THE CLIFFS AT WHOSE BASE IT WAS FORMED AND PRESERVED BY THE FINER DEPOSITS LAID UPON IT
AND BECOMES A MEADOW SOLDERING THE SAND REEF TO THE MAINLAND WHILE THE LAGOON HAS BEEN FILLING THE WAVES HAVE BEEN SO DEEPENING THE SEA FLOOR OFF THE SAND REEF
CHALCOPYRITE A MINERAL SOFTER THAN PYRITE IT CAN EASILY BE SCRATCHED WITH A KNIFE AND DEEPER YELLOW IN COLOR
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE METHOD OF VEIN DEPOSITS WE MAY CITE THE CASE OF A WOODEN BOX PIPE USED IN THE COMSTOCK MINES NEVADA TO CARRY THE HOT WATER OF THE MINE FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER

MY DEAR MISTER NORMAN I HASTEN TO WRITE YOU A NOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE EVIDENT CARRYING OUT OF YOUR PROMISE
VIRGINIA HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED MY SECRET VIRGINIA LOOKED BEWILDERED THEN OVER HER FACE THE UNUSUAL COLOR CREPT SHOWING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT RACHEL WINSLOW ROLLIN SPOKE CALMLY ENOUGH NOW
WITH PRICES ATTACHED TO THE VARIOUS ARTICLES THAT MADE HIM WONDER SOMEWHAT FOR HE WAS FAMILIAR BY THIS TIME WITH MANY FACTS IN THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE ONCE UNKNOWN TO HIM AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT THE WINDOWS THE DOOR BETWEEN THEM OPENED AND FELICIA STERLING CAME OUT FELICIA EXCLAIMED THE BISHOP
ALL THIS AS A TOTAL FACT IN ITS CONTRAST WITH THE EASY COMFORTABLE LIFE I HAVE LIVED FILLS ME MORE AND MORE WITH A SENSE OF MINGLED TERROR AND SELF ACCUSATION I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF JESUS MANY TIMES LATELY
THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
AND THEN GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE RECTANGLE THE BENEFIT OF HER CULTURE AND HER VOICE IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SELF SACRIFICE REPLIED ROLLIN A LITTLE STIFFLY VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE SHARPLY
AND HOWEVER THE BISHOP MAY HAVE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE NOTHING SO REMARKABLE ABOUT IT AT ALL THE PUBLIC CONTINUED TO TALK AND THE CHURCHES TO RECORD THEIR ASTONISHMENT THAT TWO SUCH MEN SO PROMINENT IN THE MINISTRY SHOULD LEAVE THEIR COMFORTABLE HOMES VOLUNTARILY RESIGN THEIR PLEASANT SOCIAL POSITIONS AND ENTER UPON A LIFE OF HARDSHIP OF SELF DENIAL AND ACTUAL SUFFERING
BESIDES HOW CAN YOU ACT WITH ANY MADAM PAGE PAUSED BROKE OFF HER SENTENCE AND THEN TURNED TO RACHEL WHAT WILL YOUR MOTHER SAY TO YOUR DECISION MY DEAR IS IT NOT FOOLISH

AND THE FASHION AND WEALTH OF RAYMOND WERE DISPLAYING THEMSELVES UP TOWN ON THE BOULEVARD WHEN VIRGINIA LEFT THE CARRIAGE AND WENT UP TO LOREEN SHE HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO OR WHAT THE RESULT OF HER ACTION WOULD BE
HE CAUGHT HIMSELF DRAWING ALMOST AWAY FROM THE FACTS OF TYPOGRAPHICAL UNIONS AND
THE NEWSBOYS WERE NECESSARILY SUFFERERS THROUGH THE ACTION HE HAD TAKEN
BUT HE WOULD BE LED BY EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY CAME ON HE OPENED HIS DOOR AND BEGAN THE ROUTINE OF THE OFFICE WORK
YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
ALTHOUGH TO SPEAK TRUTH FOR HIM HE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO BACK TO IT WELL DEAR BISHOP SAID FELICIA WHO HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIM SO I KNEW HOW OVERWHELMED YOU WERE WITH YOUR WORK
HIS GREAT RESPECT FOR NORMAN CHECKED HIS RISING INDIGNATION AND DISGUST BUT WITH IT ALL WAS A FEELING OF GROWING WONDER AT THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF MOTIVE WHICH HAD ENTERED THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY NEWS AND THREATENED AS HE FIRMLY BELIEVED TO DESTROY IT
THE SATURDAY AFTERNOON MATINEE AT THE AUDITORIUM IN CHICAGO WAS JUST OVER AND THE USUAL CROWD WAS STRUGGLING TO GET TO ITS CARRIAGE BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE
AND CONFRONTED VIRGINIA FULLY ROUSED AND DETERMINED VIRGINIA PLACED HER ARM ABOUT LOREEN AND CALMLY LOOKED HER GRANDMOTHER IN THE FACE YOU SHALL NOT DO THIS VIRGINIA YOU CAN SEND HER TO THE ASYLUM FOR HELPLESS WOMEN WE CAN PAY ALL THE EXPENSES
MADAM PAGE GLANCED FROM HER GRANDDAUGHTER TO LOREEN IN ASTONISHMENT
BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE INTERVIEW WITH THE GRANDMOTHER AND WHEN THE DOOR SHUT AND SHE WAS IN THE WIDE HALL WITH HER HOMELESS OUTCAST SHE FELT EQUAL TO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT NOW COME MADAM PAGE WAS IN THE LIBRARY HEARING VIRGINIA COME IN SHE CAME INTO THE HALL
HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT CLARK COULD NOT HELP EXPRESSING HIMSELF
IN SEVERAL MATTERS BEFORE HE ANSWERED HIS EVER PRESENT QUESTION IN THE RIGHT WAY IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE PAPER THAT WERE CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT HE DID NOT ACT AT ONCE BUT BECAUSE HE WAS YET HONESTLY IN DOUBT CONCERNING
JUST AS I AM WITHOUT ONE PLEA AND AS THE CARRIAGE ROLLED PAST SHE LEERED AT IT RAISING HER FACE SO THAT VIRGINIA SAW IT VERY CLOSE TO HER OWN IT WAS THE FACE OF THE GIRL WHO HAD KNEELED SOBBING THAT NIGHT WITH VIRGINIA KNEELING BESIDE HER AND PRAYING FOR HER
I AM OLDER BY SEVERAL YEARS THAN YOU YOUNG LADIES SHE SAID AND HER TRADITIONAL TYPE OF BEARING SEEMED TO RACHEL TO RISE UP LIKE A GREAT FROZEN WALL BETWEEN HER AND EVERY CONCEPTION OF JESUS AS A SACRIFICE WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED IN A SPIRIT OF FALSE EMOTION I PRESUME IS IMPOSSIBLE OF PERFORMANCE
SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
COME IN AND TRY SOME SHE EXCLAIMED YOU POOR BISHOP YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HADN'T HAD A GOOD MEAL FOR A MONTH
THERE'S NO DANGER SAID VIRGINIA BRIEFLY IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR BROTHER ROLLIN HAS BEEN CONVERTED ASKED THE FIRST SPEAKER LOOKING AT VIRGINIA CURIOUSLY IT IMPRESSED HER DURING THE DRIVE TO THE RECTANGLE THAT ALL THREE OF HER FRIENDS WERE REGARDING HER WITH CLOSE ATTENTION
HAD NO PLACE THAT COULD BE CALLED HOME THE GIRL SUDDENLY WRENCHED HER ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S GRASP IN DOING SO SHE NEARLY THREW VIRGINIA DOWN YOU SHALL NOT TOUCH ME LEAVE ME LET ME GO TO HELL THAT'S WHERE I BELONG
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
AND WITH UNDISGUISED WONDER STARED AT THE TWO GIRLS OVER THE SCENE THE WARM SUN OF SPRING POURED ITS MELLOW LIGHT A FAINT BREATH OF MUSIC FROM THE BAND STAND IN THE PARK FLOATED INTO THE RECTANGLE THE CONCERT HAD BEGUN
IF WE HAVE SUCH A LEVER AS CONSECRATED MONEY TO MOVE THINGS WITH ADD TO IT CONSECRATED PERSONAL ENTHUSIASM LIKE YOURS AND IT CERTAINLY CAN ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS SAID VIRGINIA SMILING
DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
BUT NOW DEAR I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR PART IN THIS PLAN FOR CAPTURING AND SAVING THE RECTANGLE YOUR VOICE IS A POWER I HAVE HAD MANY IDEAS LATELY HERE IS ONE OF THEM YOU COULD ORGANIZE AMONG THE GIRLS A MUSICAL INSTITUTE
RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
AND ALL THE COLD BUSINESSLIKE METHODS THAT MAKE A GREAT DAILY SUCCESSFUL
RECONSTRUCTING IT AND LIVING IN IT THEMSELVES IN THE VERY HEART OF A TERRITORY WHERE THE SALOON RULED WITH POWER WHERE THE TENEMENT WAS ITS FILTHIEST WHERE VICE AND IGNORANCE AND SHAME AND POVERTY WERE CONGESTED INTO HIDEOUS FORMS
IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
BUT THE LETTER DIRECTED NORMAN'S ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISING PHASE OF HIS PAPER HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THIS BEFORE AS HE GLANCED OVER THE COLUMNS HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CONVICTION THAT HIS MASTER COULD NOT PERMIT SOME OF THEM IN HIS PAPER
TO PUT MY LIFE INTO CONTACT WITH THE MODERN PAGANISM OF THIS CENTURY THE AWFUL CONDITION OF THE GIRLS IN SOME GREAT BUSINESS PLACES THE BRUTAL SELFISHNESS OF THE INSOLENT SOCIETY FASHION AND WEALTH THAT IGNORES ALL THE SORROW OF THE CITY
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THERE'S NO DANGER OF IT SAID ROSE RISING SUDDENLY FROM THE COUCH AS THE TEA BELL RANG
SHE WAS FAST LAPSING INTO A WRETCHED CONDITION
IT WAS NOT A NEW IDEA IT WAS AN IDEA STARTED BY JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE LEFT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE
DOCTOR BRUCE WAS VERY PALE NEVER HAD HE SEEN THE BISHOP OR HEARD HIM WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A PASSION THERE WAS A SUDDEN SILENCE IN THE ROOM THE BISHOP SAT DOWN AGAIN AND BOWED HIS HEAD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE AT LAST EDWARD
HE REPEATED AND THERE DASHED UP TO THE CURB A SPLENDID SPAN OF BLACK HORSES ATTACHED TO A CARRIAGE HAVING THE MONOGRAM C R S IN GILT LETTERS ON THE PANEL OF THE DOOR TWO GIRLS STEPPED OUT OF THE CROWD TOWARDS THE CARRIAGE THE OLDER ONE HAD ENTERED AND TAKEN HER SEAT
WHEN DID YOU MOVE INTO MY PARISH WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE HOW DID YOU FIND ME SO SOON INQUIRED FELICIA WHY DON'T YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ONLY CLEAN WINDOWS IN THE BLOCK I BELIEVE THEY ARE REPLIED FELICIA WITH A LAUGH THAT DID THE BISHOP GOOD TO HEAR
WE SHALL CERTAINLY BANKRUPT THE PAPER WITH THIS SORT OF BUSINESS POLICY DO YOU THINK SO NORMAN ASKED THE QUESTION NOT AS IF HE EXPECTED AN ANSWER BUT SIMPLY AS IF HE WERE TALKING WITH HIMSELF AFTER A PAUSE HE SAID YOU MAY DIRECT MARKS TO DO AS I HAVE SAID I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO AND AS I TOLD YOU CLARK
MURMURED FELICIA THE SHADOWS OF CHICAGO THE SHADOWS OF LONDON THE PLAY
WAS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON SOME QUEER REFORM POLICY
WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
I CANNOT RECONCILE IT WITH MY JUDGMENT OF WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO I CANNOT TELL ANOTHER PERSON WHAT TO DO BUT I FEEL THAT I OUGHT NOT TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN ASKED VIRGINIA WITH GREAT INTEREST
AS THE HORSES WERE DRIVEN RAPIDLY UP TO THE CURB HELD THERE IMPATIENTLY BY THE DRIVERS WHO HAD SHIVERED LONG IN THE RAW EAST WIND AND THEN LET GO TO PLUNGE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTO THE RIVER OF VEHICLES THAT TOSSED UNDER THE ELEVATED RAILWAY AND FINALLY WENT WHIRLING OFF UP THE AVENUE
IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
YOU'RE MISTAKEN I'M NOT GOING ON THE STAGE IT'S A GREAT PITY YOU'D MAKE A HIT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT YOUR SINGING THIS TIME RACHEL FLUSHED WITH GENUINE ANGER BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA BROKE IN WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY EVERYBODY
MY MONEY I MEAN GOD'S WHICH HE WANTS ME TO USE CAN BUILD WHOLESOME LODGING HOUSES REFUGES FOR POOR WOMEN ASYLUMS FOR SHOP GIRLS SAFETY FOR MANY AND MANY A LOST GIRL LIKE LOREEN
IT IS YOUR HOME WITH ME AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN BUT IN THIS MATTER I MUST ACT AS I FULLY BELIEVE JESUS WOULD IN MY PLACE I AM WILLING TO BEAR ALL THAT SOCIETY MAY SAY OR DO SOCIETY IS NOT MY GOD BY THE SIDE OF THIS POOR SOUL
I HAVE NOT LOOKED OUT OF THIS WINDOW FOR WEEKS WITHOUT A FEELING OF HORROR TOWARD MYSELF AS I SEE THE HUMANITY THAT PASSES BY THIS HOUSE VIRGINIA TURNED AWAY AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM RACHEL WATCHED HER AND COULD NOT REPRESS THE RISING TIDE OF HER OWN GROWING DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP
YES THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE WE'LL GO BANKRUPT IN THIRTY DAYS NORMAN DID NOT REPLY AT ONCE HE WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL
YOU DO NOT BELONG TO HELL YOU BELONG TO JESUS AND HE WILL SAVE YOU COME THE GIRL SUDDENLY BURST INTO TEARS SHE WAS ONLY PARTLY SOBERED BY THE SHOCK OF MEETING VIRGINIA VIRGINIA LOOKED AROUND AGAIN WHERE DOES MISTER GRAY LIVE SHE ASKED
I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY FOR MYSELF TO SUFFER FOR HIS SAKE AS I FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO SUFFER AGAIN THAT SUDDEN SILENCE FELL OVER THOSE TWO MEN IT WAS NO ORDINARY ACTION THEY WERE DECIDING
THAT JESUS WOULD NEVER USE ANY TALENT LIKE A GOOD VOICE JUST TO MAKE MONEY BUT NOW TAKE THIS CONCERT OFFER HERE IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY TO TRAVEL WITH AN IMPERSONATOR AND A VIOLINIST AND A MALE QUARTET ALL PEOPLE OF GOOD REPUTATION
SHE KNEW THAT THE EVANGELIST BOARDED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE TENT A NUMBER OF VOICES GAVE THE DIRECTION COME LOREEN I WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME TO MISTER GRAY'S SHE SAID
YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE DRIVEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN FAVOR OF A DRUNKEN WOMAN THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR VIRGINIA TO REPLY SHE TURNED AGAIN AND WENT UPSTAIRS VIRGINIA CALLED A SERVANT AND SOON HAD LOREEN CARED FOR
OR WHAT LED TO THE MOVEMENT HE FINALLY MADE TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO KNEW HIM BETTER THAN BY RELATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND THE BISHOP AT THIS TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLEDGE IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH THE TWO FRIENDS WERE AS BEFORE IN DOCTOR BRUCE'S HOUSE SEATED IN HIS STUDY
HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
RACHEL PICKED UP A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN LYING IN HER LAP AND RAN OVER ITS CONTENTS AGAIN IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE MANAGER OF A COMIC OPERA OFFERING HER A PLACE WITH A LARGE TRAVELING COMPANY OF THE SEASON THE SALARY WAS A VERY LARGE FIGURE
HERE'S THIS PRESS REPORT OF YESTERDAY'S PRIZE FIGHT AT THE RESORT IT WILL MAKE UP THREE COLUMNS AND A HALF I SUPPOSE IT ALL GOES IN
WITH HIS EYES OPEN TO ALL THE POSSIBLE RESULTS
I BELIEVE THAT TOO THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAVE PROMISED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD IS INCREASING IF WE ONCE HAVE SAY FIVE HUNDRED SUCH DISCIPLES IN RAYMOND THE SALOON IS DOOMED
I AM HAVING A HARDER TIME THAN YOU ARE DEAR TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD DO ARE YOU RACHEL ASKED
THE RECENT FREAK OF YOUR PAPER IN REFUSING TO PRINT THE ACCOUNT OF THE FAMOUS CONTEST AT THE RESORT HAS DECIDED ME FINALLY TO CHANGE MY PAPER
IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
I THINK PERHAPS IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME AT ANY OTHER TIME THAN THE ONE HE CHOSE I COULD EASILY HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I LOVED HIM BUT NOT NOW AGAIN RACHEL PAUSED SUDDENLY AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT VIRGINIA AGAIN THERE WERE TEARS ON HER FACE
THERE WAS NO CONNECTION IMPLIED IN THE TOBACCO MERCHANT'S LETTER BETWEEN THE OMISSION OF THE PRIZE FIGHT
AND UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE AND THE MINISTER AS A LUXURIOUS IDLER ALL THE VAST TUMULT OF THIS VAST TORRENT OF HUMANITY WITH ITS FALSE AND ITS TRUE IDEAS ITS EXAGGERATION OF EVILS IN THE CHURCH AND ITS BITTERNESS AND SHAME THAT ARE THE RESULT OF MANY COMPLEX CAUSES
BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
SOMETIMES AS IN THIS CASE IT WAS MERELY A NOMINAL INQUIRY YES NO LET ME SEE IT
HE HAD WALKED ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS WHEN HE WAS ATTRACTED BY A SHOP THAT LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS STILL QUITE NEW TO HIM AND EVERY DAY HE DISCOVERED SOME STRANGE SPOT OR STUMBLED UPON SOME UNEXPECTED HUMANITY
YE DID IT NOT UNTO ME AND WHEN HAVE I PERSONALLY VISITED THE PRISONER OR THE DESPERATE OR THE SINFUL IN ANY WAY THAT HAS ACTUALLY CAUSED ME SUFFERING RATHER I HAVE FOLLOWED THE CONVENTIONAL SOFT HABITS OF MY POSITION
THERE HAVE BEEN QUEER DOINGS IN RAYMOND DURING THE PAST YEAR
A FRIEND OF PUBLICANS AND SINNERS SURELY JESUS WOULD DO THIS THAT SHE WAS DOING DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL IS ASKED MADAM PAGE IN AN ANGRY WHISPER STEPPING NEAR VIRGINIA I KNOW VERY WELL
MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
EXCUSE ME LADIES SAID ROLLIN RISING FROM THE TABLE THE CONVERSATION IS GETTING BEYOND MY DEPTH
I SHALL NOT STAY HERE THEN SAID MADAM PAGE SHE TURNED SUDDENLY AND WALKED TO THE END OF THE HALL SHE THEN CAME BACK AND GOING UP TO VIRGINIA SAID WITH AN EMPHASIS THAT REVEALED HER INTENSIVE EXCITEMENT OF PASSION
BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
HE WAS COMING BACK TO THE SETTLEMENT VERY LATE FROM SOME GATHERING OF THE STRIKING TAILORS AND WAS WALKING ALONG WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WHEN TWO MEN JUMPED OUT FROM BEHIND AN OLD FENCE THAT SHUT OFF AN ABANDONED FACTORY FROM THE STREET AND FACED HIM
SHE ASKED IN A COLD SNEERING VOICE THAT HURT VIRGINIA MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD YET FELT YES I SAID SO VIRGINIA'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE SEEMED TO RECALL A VERSE THAT MISTER GRAY HAD USED FOR ONE OF HIS RECENT SERMONS
OF CHRISTIAN WORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN THE HEART OF GREAT CITY SLUMS I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO TELL JUST WHAT IS THE WISEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN RAYMOND BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH
AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SILENCE THE QUESTION OF LATE WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST PAUL WAS TOLD WHAT GREAT THINGS HE MUST SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF HIS LORD
WHICH HAD NOT BEEN VERY ANIMATED RACHEL COLORED AND FELT ANNOYED WHO TOLD YOU SHE ASKED
A VERY GOOD THING FOR ME THE BISHOP SAYS I OUGHT TO BE VERY GRATEFUL I AM I AM VERY HAPPY NOW I LEARNED THE TRADE HOPING SOME TIME TO BE OF USE I AM NIGHT CLERK AT ONE OF THE HOTELS THAT SUNDAY MORNING WHEN YOU TOOK THE PLEDGE AT NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
VIRGINIA CAME AND STOOD BY HER
IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
MADAM PAGE LOOKED SHARPLY AT VIRGINIA BEFORE SHE SAID ANYTHING OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND MISTER MAXWELL'S STATEMENT
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
AND WAS REPUTED TO BE WORTH SOMETHING OVER TWO MILLIONS
A PUZZLE TO HER FATHER A SOURCE OF IRRITATION TO HER MOTHER AND WITH A GREAT UNSURVEYED TERRITORY OF THOUGHT AND ACTION IN HERSELF OF WHICH SHE WAS MORE THAN DIMLY CONSCIOUS THERE WAS THAT IN FELICIA THAT WOULD EASILY ENDURE ANY CONDITION IN LIFE
MEANWHILE NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH WAS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING NEVER KNOWN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY
OH GIVING THOSE VIOLETS TO THAT BOY HE LOOKED AS IF HE NEEDED A GOOD HOT SUPPER MORE THAN A BUNCH OF VIOLETS IT'S A WONDER YOU DIDN'T INVITE HIM HOME WITH US I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF YOU HAD
CLARK ROSE THE REPORT DOES NOT GO IN
THEY WERE BEING MADE THE OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND DISGUSTED LET'S GO BACK I'VE SEEN ENOUGH SAID THE GIRL WHO WAS SITTING WITH VIRGINIA THEY WERE AT THAT MOMENT JUST OPPOSITE A NOTORIOUS SALOON AND GAMBLING HOUSE
YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
IF ONLY THE LIBERTY TO ACT FULLY ON HER CONSCIENTIOUS CONVICTIONS WERE GRANTED HER HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU FELICIA SAID MISTER STERLING HANDING IT TO HER FELICIA SAT DOWN AND INSTANTLY OPENED THE LETTER SAYING AS SHE DID SO IT'S FROM RACHEL WELL
EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE WOULD WELL THAT'S MY ONLY REASON FOR SHUTTING THIS ACCOUNT OUT OF THE NEWS
ALEXANDER POWERS USED TO BE A FRIEND OF MINE WE LEARNED TELEGRAPHY IN THE SAME OFFICE
SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
THREE MONTHS HAD GONE BY SINCE THE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN DOCTOR BRUCE CAME INTO HIS PULPIT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW DISCIPLESHIP THEY WERE THREE MONTHS OF GREAT EXCITEMENT IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
I BELIEVE MISTER MAXWELL WAS RIGHT
AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
TO MADAM PAGE SOCIETY REPRESENTED MORE THAN THE CHURCH OR ANY OTHER INSTITUTION IT WAS A POWER TO BE FEARED AND OBEYED THE LOSS OF ITS GOOD WILL WAS A LOSS MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LOSS OF WEALTH ITSELF SHE STOOD ERECT AND STERN
GRANDMOTHER VIRGINIA SPOKE WITHOUT HESITATION AND VERY CLEARLY I HAVE BROUGHT ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM THE RECTANGLE SHE IS IN TROUBLE AND HAS NO HOME I AM GOING TO CARE FOR HER HERE A LITTLE WHILE
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BOX WITH THE DELANOS TONIGHT FELICIA TURNED HER FACE TOWARDS HER SISTER HER GREAT BROWN EYES WERE VERY EXPRESSIVE AND NOT ALTOGETHER FREE FROM A SPARKLE OF LUMINOUS HEAT AND YET
REEKING WITH THE FUMES OF LIQUOR BE CARED FOR IN VIRGINIA'S OWN HOME INSTEAD OF BEING CONSIGNED TO STRANGERS IN SOME HOSPITAL OR HOUSE OF CHARITY VIRGINIA REALLY KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT ANY SUCH PLACES OF REFUGE AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN RAYMOND BUT
I SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY SAID VIRGINIA SMILING ACROSS THE TABLE I WAS IN THE NEWS OFFICE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES YES REPLIED RACHEL HASTILY I UNDERSTAND THAT MADAM PAGE
THE FIELD WHERE THE TENT NOW IS HAS BEEN IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS WE MEAN TO SECURE THE ENTIRE TRACT AS SOON AS THE COURTS HAVE SETTLED THE TITLE FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN MAKING A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS AND RESIDENCE METHODS
BUT WHY HAVE YOU DARED TO COME TO CHICAGO WITHOUT TELLING ME AND HOW HAVE YOU ENTERED MY DIOCESE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE ASKED THE BISHOP AND FELICIA LOOKED SO LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL CLEAN EDUCATED REFINED WORLD HE ONCE KNEW THAT HE MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR SEEING IN HER SOMETHING OF THE OLD PARADISE
THAT THE RECTANGLE SHOWED A DELICACY IN ITS SAD SILENCE THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO THE BOULEVARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IT FLASHED ACROSS HER
RACHEL LOOKED AT VIRGINIA THOUGHTFULLY I HAVE NEVER GIVEN MY HEART TO HIM I AM SURE HE TOUCHED MY EMOTIONS AND I ADMIRED HIS SKILL AS A WRITER I HAVE THOUGHT AT TIMES THAT I CARED A GOOD DEAL FOR HIM
THE BISHOP'S FACE GREW IN GLORY NOW EVERY DAY MY PLAN REPLIED DOCTOR BRUCE SLOWLY IS IN BRIEF THE PUTTING OF MYSELF INTO THE CENTRE OF THE GREATEST HUMAN NEED I CAN FIND IN THIS CITY AND LIVING THERE
ROLLIN SUDDENLY STOPPED HE SEEMED DEEPLY AGITATED HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S AND WALKED ALONE TO THE END OF THE HALL THEN HE RETURNED WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND STOPPED NEAR HIS SISTER AND SAID
GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR TRAINING THERE ARE SOME SPLENDID VOICES IN THE ROUGH THERE DID ANY ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SINGING AS THAT YESTERDAY BY THOSE WOMEN RACHEL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
HIS FINE FACE ACTUALLY GLOWED WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOVEMENT IN WHICH HE AND HIS FRIEND WERE INEVITABLY EMBARKED HE WENT ON AND UNFOLDED A PLAN OF SUCH FAR REACHING POWER AND POSSIBILITY THAT DOCTOR BRUCE CAPABLE AND EXPERIENCED AS HE WAS
DRIVE ON DON'T WAIT FOR ME I AM GOING TO SEE MY FRIEND HOME SHE SAID CALMLY ENOUGH THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL SEEMED TO GASP AT THE WORD FRIEND WHEN VIRGINIA SPOKE IT SHE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING THE OTHER GIRLS SEEMED SPEECHLESS GO ON
THE STREET WAS NARROW AND THE SIDEWALK CROWDED SUDDENLY OUT OF THE DOOR OF THIS SALOON A YOUNG WOMAN REELED SHE WAS SINGING IN A BROKEN DRUNKEN SOB
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO AND THEN DOING IT REGARDLESS OF RESULTS
I THINK IT WILL SIMPLY RUIN THE PAPER REPLIED CLARK PROMPTLY HE WAS GATHERING UP HIS BEWILDERED SENSES AND BEGAN TO REMONSTRATE WHY IT ISN'T FEASIBLE TO RUN A PAPER NOWADAYS ON ANY SUCH BASIS IT'S TOO IDEAL THE WORLD ISN'T READY FOR IT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT PAY
VIRGINIA WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE STARE THAT GREETED HER AND HER COMPANION AS THEY ENTERED BUT HER THOUGHT WAS DIRECTED MORE AND MORE TO THE APPROACHING SCENE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD MADAM PAGE SAY LOREEN WAS NEARLY SOBER NOW BUT SHE WAS LAPSING INTO A STATE OF STUPOR
AND OCCASIONALLY TO EASE ITS CONSCIENCE DONATING WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL SACRIFICE A LITTLE MONEY TO CHARITY
HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
BUT LOREEN STAGGERING ALONG WITH A YOUNG LADY FROM THE SOCIETY CIRCLES UPTOWN SUPPORTING HER WAS ANOTHER THING THE RECTANGLE VIEWED IT WITH SOBERNESS AND MORE OR LESS WONDERING ADMIRATION
WHICH HER FRIEND VIRGINIA PAGE IS PUTTING UP ARE COMPLETED
AND THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
MY WIFE IS FULLY IN ACCORD WITH ME WE HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO FIND A RESIDENCE IN THAT PART OF THE CITY WHERE WE CAN MAKE OUR PERSONAL LIVES COUNT FOR THE MOST LET ME SUGGEST A PLACE THE BISHOP WAS ON FIRE NOW
WE NEVER WEEP OVER THE REAL THING ON THE ACTUAL STAGE OF LIFE WHAT ARE THE SHADOWS OF LONDON ON THE STAGE TO THE SHADOWS OF LONDON OR CHICAGO AS THEY REALLY EXIST
WHAT'S THE LATEST NEWS FROM RAYMOND ASKED MISTER STERLING TAKING HIS CIGAR OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND LOOKING AT FELICIA WITH HALF SHUT EYES AS IF HE WERE STUDYING HER RACHEL SAYS DOCTOR BRUCE HAS BEEN STAYING IN RAYMOND FOR TWO SUNDAYS
HE KNEELED DOWN BY HIS DESK AND PRAYED FOR THE DIVINE PRESENCE AND WISDOM TO DIRECT HIM HE ROSE WITH THE DAY BEFORE HIM AND HIS PROMISE DISTINCT AND CLEAR IN HIS MIND NOW FOR ACTION HE SEEMED TO SAY
MISSUS WINSLOW WAS THAT WOMAN OH
PAY AN INDIRECT COMPLIMENT HE IS LIKE HIS FATHER IN THAT BUT WE ARE ALL CURIOUS TO KNOW SOMETHING OF YOUR PLANS WE CLAIM THE RIGHT FROM OLD ACQUAINTANCE YOU KNOW AND VIRGINIA HAS ALREADY TOLD US OF YOUR CONCERT COMPANY OFFER
WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID SMOTE RACHEL WITH GREAT FORCE BECAUSE OF THE SIMILAR POSITION IN WHICH THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND THEMSELVES LUNCH WAS ANNOUNCED AND THEY WENT OUT AND WERE JOINED BY VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER MADAM PAGE A HANDSOME STATELY WOMAN OF SIXTY FIVE
SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THE LOSS WILL FALL ON MYSELF NEITHER THE REPORTERS NOR THE PRESSMEN NEED MAKE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND NO ONE SPOKE
I TOLD HIM NO I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST CONVERSIONS AT THE RECTANGLE I AM GLAD FOR YOU SAID VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHY ASKED RACHEL A LITTLE STARTLED
WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT QUESTION WAS BECOMING WITH HER AS WITH MANY OTHERS A HABIT OF LIFE SHE LOOKED AROUND NOW AS SHE STOOD CLOSE BY LOREEN AND THE WHOLE SCENE WAS CRUELLY VIVID TO HER
I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY MONEY TO HELP THOSE WOMEN TO A BETTER LIFE VIRGINIA LOOKED OVER TO THE END OF THE HALL WHERE THE DAY BEFORE LOREEN'S BODY HAD LAIN I HAVE DECIDED ON A GOOD PLAN AS IT SEEMS TO ME
BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL HURT THAT RACHEL HAD KEPT BACK SOMETHING SHE WAS SIMPLY CONSCIOUS OF MORE ON RACHEL'S MIND THAN SHE HAD REVEALED VERY SOON ROLLIN CAME BACK AND HE AND VIRGINIA ARM IN ARM AS THEY HAD LATELY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG HALL
WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE THAT FUTURE FACT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WILL YOU STAY BY THE NEWS UNTIL IT IS BANKRUPT ASKED NORMAN WITH A STRANGE SMILE
HE CONFRONTED IT WITH A DEGREE OF HESITATION AND A FEELING NEARLY AKIN TO FEAR HE HAD COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE VERY EARLY AND FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS BY HIMSELF HE SAT AT HIS DESK IN A GROWING THOUGHTFULNESS THAT FINALLY BECAME A DESIRE WHICH HE KNEW WAS AS GREAT AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
THE DEVIL IS WAITING FOR ME SEE HIM SHE EXCLAIMED HOARSELY SHE TURNED AND POINTED WITH A SHAKING FINGER AT THE SALOON KEEPER THE CROWD LAUGHED VIRGINIA STEPPED UP TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER LOREEN SHE SAID FIRMLY COME WITH ME
I SHALL STATE IN THAT ISSUE MY REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING IN ORDER TO MAKE UP TO THE SUBSCRIBERS THE AMOUNT OF READING MATTER THEY MAY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES ENTITLED TO WE CAN ISSUE A DOUBLE NUMBER ON SATURDAY AS IS DONE BY MANY EVENING PAPERS THAT MAKE NO ATTEMPT AT A SUNDAY EDITION
THE BISHOP REPLIED TO ONE VALUED FRIEND WHO HAD ALMOST WITH TEARS TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE WHY SHOULD WHAT DOCTOR BRUCE AND I PROPOSE TO DO SEEM SO REMARKABLE A THING AS IF IT WERE UNHEARD OF THAT A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND A BISHOP SHOULD WANT TO SAVE LOST SOULS IN THIS PARTICULAR MANNER
I HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I AM NOT CONDEMNING THE CHURCH I LOVE HER
MISS STERLING MISTER STEPHEN CLYDE SAID THE BISHOP
CONCERNING THE CONCERT COMPANY'S OFFER
BEFORE VIRGINIA HAD CEASED SPEAKING RACHEL'S FACE WAS PERFECTLY TRANSFORMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HER LIFE WORK IT FLOWED INTO HER HEART AND MIND LIKE A FLOOD AND THE TORRENT OF HER FEELING OVERFLOWED IN TEARS THAT COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED
IT NEVER TOOK ITSELF SERIOUSLY WHEN IT WAS DRUNK BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE RICHEST MOST BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED GIRLS IN ALL RAYMOND WAS TAKING CARE OF ONE OF THE RECTANGLE'S MOST NOTED CHARACTERS WHO REELED ALONG UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR
THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
SOMEHOW WHAT ROLLIN PAGE HAD SAID AND HIS MANNER IN SAYING IT HAD HASTENED HER DECISION IN THE MATTER WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US RACHEL YOUR REASONS FOR REFUSING THE OFFER
I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
AND THE WORKING MAN ESPECIALLY WHO WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH ANY WAY
HUNDREDS OF MEN IN THE HOTELS AND STORES DOWN TOWN AS WELL AS REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS EAGERLY OPENED THE PAPER AND SEARCHED IT THROUGH FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT FIGHT
COMPARED WITH PAUL OR ANY OF THE CHRISTIAN MARTYRS OR EARLY DISCIPLES I HAVE LIVED A LUXURIOUS SINFUL LIFE FULL OF EASE AND PLEASURE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I HAVE THAT WITHIN ME WHICH OF LATE RISES IN OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A FOLLOWING OF JESUS
PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE AT THAT CONCERT PITCH ALL THE TIME YOU SEE IF RACHEL DOESN'T GIVE IT UP SOON IT'S A GREAT PITY SHE DOESN'T COME TO CHICAGO AND SING IN THE AUDITORIUM CONCERTS SHE HAS RECEIVED AN OFFER I'M GOING TO WRITE AND URGE HER TO COME I'M JUST DYING TO HEAR HER SING FELICIA
WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
SAID ONE OF THE GIRLS WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH
FELICIA ASKED THE QUESTION SOFTLY AND ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE ALONE QUEER ISN'T JUST THE WORD OF COURSE REPLIED ROSE INDIFFERENTLY IT WOULD BE WHAT MADAM BLANC CALLS
NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT WAS ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WHY NOT RAYMOND ENJOYED A SYSTEM OF HIGH LICENSE AND THE SALOON AND THE BILLIARD HALL
THERE'S NO GREAT VIRTUE IN SAYING NO TO THIS OFFER WHEN I HAVE THE OTHER ONE RACHEL WENT ON THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S HARDER TO DECIDE BUT I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO TELL THE TRUTH VIRGINIA I'M COMPLETELY CONVINCED IN THE FIRST CASE
IN FACT HE DID THINK SOMETHING WAS WRONG THOUGH MISTER NORMAN WAS ONE OF THE LAST MEN IN THE WORLD IN HIS JUDGMENT TO LOSE HIS MIND
BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
I HAVE COME TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT YET KEPT MY PROMISE TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THE WAY THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO IF I SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO WALK IN HIS STEPS DOCTOR BRUCE HAD RISEN AND WAS PACING HIS STUDY
I'M ASKED TO GO AS ONE OF THE COMPANY AND SING LEADING SOPRANO THE SALARY I MENTIONED IT DIDN'T I IS GUARANTEED TO BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SEASON BUT I DON'T FEEL SATISFIED THAT JESUS WOULD GO WHAT DO YOU THINK
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PEOPLE ARE DIRTY AND DISAGREEABLE AND IT'S TOO MUCH BOTHER I SUPPOSE REPLIED ROSE CARELESSLY FELICIA YOU CAN NEVER REFORM THE WORLD WHAT'S THE USE
RACHEL STOPPED AND SAT WITH HER HANDS CLASPED ON HER LAP AND THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES VIRGINIA I THOUGHT A LITTLE WHILE AGO I LOVED HIM AS HE SAID HE LOVED ME BUT WHEN HE SPOKE MY HEART FELT REPELLED AND I SAID WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY
AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN LOOKED AT IT SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT SUDDENLY VIRGINIA BROKE OUT AS RACHEL HAD NEVER HEARD HER BEFORE RACHEL
FELT AMAZED AT THE VISION OF A GREATER SOUL THAN HIS OWN THEY SAT UP LATE AND WERE AS EAGER AND EVEN GLAD AS IF THEY WERE PLANNING FOR A TRIP TOGETHER TO SOME RARE LAND OF UNEXPLORED TRAVEL
I PROPOSE CERTAIN CHANGES WHICH I BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY
THIS IS A TERRIBLE CITY IN WHICH WE LIVE ITS MISERY ITS SIN ITS SELFISHNESS APPALL MY HEART AND I HAVE STRUGGLED FOR YEARS WITH THE SICKENING DREAD OF THE TIME WHEN I SHOULD BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE PLEASANT LUXURY OF MY OFFICIAL POSITION
AS GOOD AS THE AUDITORIUM BANQUETS WERE SIMPLY HUSKS COMPARED WITH THIS ONE FELICIA BUT YOU MUST COME TO THE SETTLEMENT I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING AND I AM SIMPLY ASTONISHED TO FIND YOU HERE EARNING YOUR LIVING THIS WAY
SHE SPOKE NOW IN REPLY TO MADAM PAGE IN ONE OF THOSE RARE MOMENTS OF UNRESERVE THAT ADDED TO THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF HER WHOLE CHARACTER
HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND WITH THAT WISH SHE WAS BOUND TO COMPLY OF COURSE SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE MARY AT BRAGTON OR IF THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE SHE HERSELF WOULD COME INTO DILLSBOROUGH
IN THE CARRIAGE SHE HAD ASKED HIM WHETHER HE LOVED HER AND HE HAD SAID THAT HE DID HE HAD ALSO DECLARED THAT HE WOULD DO ANYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE HER HAPPY WAS A MAN TO BE BOUND TO MARRY A GIRL BECAUSE OF SUCH A SCENE AS THAT THERE WAS HOWEVER
ON THIS EVENING IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEN LORD RUFFORD'S TIME WAS SPENT IN ARRANGING THE PARTY FOR THE MEET ON MONDAY WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP TO BED ARABELLA HAD HAD NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY THAN WHAT FORTUNE HAD GIVEN HER AT DINNER AND EVEN THEN SHE HAD BEEN WATCHED
THAT HE WOULD NEVER WILLINGLY GO INTO MARY'S PRESENCE AGAIN WHY SHOULD HE DISTURB HIS MIND ABOUT SUCH A GIRL
HE WROTE A LINE TO LARRY ASKING HIM TO SHOOT ON NEXT SATURDAY AND TO DINE WITH HIM AFTERWARDS AT THE BUSH THAT EVENING ON HIS RETURN HOME HE FOUND BOTH THE LETTERS FROM ARABELLA AS IT HAPPENED HE READ THEM IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN
IF SHE HAD MADE HER ELECTION SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO ABIDE BY IT IF SHE MEANT TO MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN WHAT GOOD COULD SHE GET BY ASSOCIATING WITH HIS AUNT OR WITH HIM
SHE MUST SCRUPLE AT NOTHING THAT MIGHT BIND HIM SHE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE OF HER UNCLE AND THAT UNCLE A DUKE
BOTH THE CLERGYMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO LADY AUGUSTUS AND HER DAUGHTER AND MISTER MAINWARING AT ONCE TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE LADIES TITLE ARABELLA DID NOT SIT DOWN SO THAT MORTON HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STANDING NEAR TO HIS LOVE
I HOPE NOT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS FOR MONEY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR OWN AND I AM TOLD THAT HE HAS A VERY NICE PROPERTY IN RUFFORD THERE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF HIS COMING HERE TO MORROW AND PERHAPS HE KNOWS HIM WHO IS THE NEIGHBOUR AUNT
ARABELLA I THINK YOU'D BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT IT WON'T DO IT MUST DO SAID ARABELLA YOU'RE VERY FOND OF HIM IT SEEMS MAMMA HOW YOU DO DELIGHT TO TORTURE ME AS IF MY LIFE WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR MAKING IT WORSE
IT MIGHT BE THE MEANS OF SAVING THAT UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE THE STORY OF HIS UNREQUITED LOVE WAS KNOWN TO EVERY ONE AT DILLSBOROUGH AND IT WAS NOW TOLD TO LORD RUFFORD HE IS NOT HALF A BAD FELLOW SAID HAMPTON
THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS HE SAID WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF A MAN WITH A LARGE INCOME SAYS TO A GIRL LIKE THAT THAT THE SUN SHINES HE ENCOURAGES HOPE I UNDERSTAND THAT WELL ENOUGH I AM A RICH MAN WITH A TITLE AND A BIG HOUSE AND A GREAT COMMAND OF LUXURIES
I DON'T KNOW THAT GETTING ALONG EASY IS WHAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY GOT IN VIEW SAID MISTER GOTOBED WHO WAS CERTAINLY IN QUEST OF INFORMATION BUT IT IS WHAT I HAVE IN VIEW MISTER GOTOBED SO IF YOU PLEASE WE'LL TAKE THE PRE EMINENCE OF YOUR COUNTRY FOR GRANTED
WHY SHE HAD BEHAVED SO UNLIKE HER USUAL SELF BEFORE LORD RUFFORD'S ARRIVAL AND WHY SHE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO HAVE MISTER MORTON INVITED THE DUCHESS WAS IN HER WAY A CLEVER WOMAN AND COULD SEE MANY THINGS SHE COULD SEE THAT THOUGH HER NIECE MIGHT BE VERY ANXIOUS TO MARRY LORD RUFFORD
IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME AND MEET US AND I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE GRACIOUS IN THIS WAY SHE MADE HER PEACE AND AS SHE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST DOING A PORTION OF THE HARD WORK OF HER LIFE SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE AS SWEETLY AS SHE COULD
BUT AS I HAVE GOT SO FAR FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET IT GO ON IF YOU BREAK WITH HIM I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING AND THROW MYSELF INTO HIS HANDS LADY AUGUSTUS SIGHED DEEPLY I WILL MAMMA IT WAS YOU SPOTTED THIS MAN
THE MESSAGE WAS WHISPERED INTO HER EAR BY HER AUNT'S OWN WOMAN AS SHE WAS LISTENING WITH GREAT ATTENTION TO LADY DRUMMOND'S TROUBLES IN REGARD TO HER NURSERY ARRANGEMENTS SHE NODDED HER HEAD
A SUBJECT NOT VERY AGREEABLE TO THE RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S AS HIS LIVING HAD BEEN BOUGHT FOR HIM WITH HIS WIFE'S MONEY DURING THE INCUMBENCY OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF SEVENTY EIGHT MISTER COOPER WHO WAS HIMSELF NEARLY THAT AGE AND WHO WAS VICAR OF MALLINGHAM
THE FISH AND SOUP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED AND THE DUKE WAS WAKENING HIMSELF TO ELOQUENCE ON THE FIRST ENTREE WHEN LORD RUFFORD ENTERED THE ROOM
SHE HAD OFTEN DONE SO WHEN THEY WERE NOT ENGAGED AND SURELY SHE MIGHT DO SO NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HER COMING DOWN TO THE LIBRARY WHEN SHE HAD GOT RID OF HER TRAVELLING CLOTHES AND IN THIS HOPE HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
HAD FLOWN OVER IT WITH THE MAJOR ON HER BACK TAKING IT AS LARRY AFTERWARDS DESCRIBED JUST IN HER STRIDE WITHOUT CONDESCENDING TO LOOK AT IT I WAS JUST BEHIND THE MAJOR AND SAW HER DO IT LARRY UNDERSTOOD THAT A MAN SHOULD NEVER TALK OF HIS OWN PLACE IN A RUN
SUCH THINGS WERE OFTEN PLANNED BY LORD RUFFORD AND AFTERWARDS FORGOTTEN OR NEGLECTED
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY EYES WERE UPON HER BUT SHE KNEW HOW TO SUSTAIN THAT NOBODY WAS PRESENT WHO COULD DARE TO INTERFERE WITH HER
BUT NOTHING WAS SAID AS TO ARABELLA'S HUNTING BECAUSE THE QUESTION WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAISED AS TO HER RETURN TO MISTLETOE IN THE EVENING IT WAS HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE ARABELLA HAD GAINED TWO THINGS SHE WOULD HAVE HER ONE DAY'S HUNTING
AT ALL POINTS LORD MISTLETOE WHO HAD A LARGE FAMILY OF HIS OWN LIVED TWENTY MILES OFF SO THAT THE FATHER AND SON COULD MEET PLEASANTLY WITHOUT FEAR OF QUARRELLING DURING THE FIRST EVENING ARABELLA DID CONTRIVE TO MAKE HERSELF VERY AGREEABLE
SHE WANTS YOU TO GO TO HER AT CHELTENHAM FOR A MONTH OH MISTER MORTON WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO HOW SHOULD I NOT LIKE TO GO LADY USHANT IS MY DEAREST DEAREST FRIEND IT IS SO VERY GOOD OF HER TO THINK OF ME
WHEN THIS WAS RECEIVED THE POOR MAN WAS SMOKING HIS MOODY PIPE IN SILENCE AS HE ROAMED ABOUT HIS OWN FARMYARD IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
OF COURSE IF A MAN WERE A SAINT OR A PHILOSOPHER OR A JOSEPH HE WOULDN'T GET INTO SUCH SCRAPES AND PERHAPS EVERY MAN OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS TOM WELL WHAT IS IT IF THIS HAD COME FROM ANY OTHER MAN THAN YOURSELF I SHOULD QUARREL WITH HIM I AM NOT ENGAGED TO THE YOUNG LADY NOR HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO WARRANT ANYBODY IN SAYING SO
SHE HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR MEETING HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND WITHOUT CAUSING SURPRISE AND HAD GAINED THAT STEP BUT SHOULD SHE SUCCEED AS SHE HOPED
INQUIRING AS TO A CERTAIN HIRING OF ROOMS AND PREPARATION FOR A DINNER OR DINNERS WHICH HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF IN REFERENCE TO A FINAL SHOOTING DECREED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF DILLSBOROUGH IN THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY
HE KEPT AN EXCELLENT HOUSE IN LONDON BUT HAVING NO COUNTRY HOUSE OF HIS OWN PASSED MUCH OF HIS TIME AT RUFFORD HALL WHEN THE OWNER WAS NOT THERE
A FACT WHICH IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED TO THE SENATOR IN ALL ITS BEARINGS WOULD GREATLY HAVE ADDED TO HIS DELIGHT BUT DICK VIEWED HIM AND WITH MANY HOLLOAS
THOUGH ALL THE DUCHESSES IN ENGLAND WERE TO PERSECUTE ME TO THE DEATH I MEAN TO STICK TO THAT THEN SIR GEORGE READ THE LETTERS AND HANDED THEM BACK SHE SEEMS TO ME SAID HE TO HAVE MORE WIT ABOUT HER
PROVIDENCE INTERFERES THE BATTLE WAS CARRIED ON VERY FIERCELY IN MISTER MASTERS HOUSE IN DILLSBOROUGH TO THE MISERY OF ALL WITHIN IT
AND I WON'T STOP YOU I AM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MISTER RUGGLES SAID KATE NOT SCRUPLING FOR A MOMENT TO TAKE THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED HER THE FOX HAD TURNED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT WHICH WAS IN LARRY'S FAVOUR
THE PARAGON HARDLY VOUCHSAFED HIM A WORD OF REPLY BUT ESCAPED UP STAIRS TRUSTING THAT HE MIGHT MEET MISS TREFOIL ON THE WAY HE WAS A BOLD MAN AND EVEN VENTURED TO KNOCK AT HER DOOR BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
NOR IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT I EVER SHALL BE SO ENGAGED SO SAYING HE TOOK UP HIS CANDLESTICK AND WALKED OFF EARLY ON THE NEXT MORNING HE SAW HIS FRIEND AND MADE SOME SORT OF LAUGHING APOLOGY FOR HIS HEAT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
TONY TUPPET WHO KNEW EVERY FOOT OF THAT DOUBLE DITCH AND BANK AND EVERY FOOT IN THE HEDGE ABOVE KEPT WELL TO THE LEFT AND CREPT THROUGH A SPOT WHERE ONE DITCH RAN INTO THE OTHER INTERSECTING OF THE FENCE TONY LIKE A KNOWING HUNTSMAN AS HE WAS
SOMETIMES WHISPERING AS THE DUCHESS COULD PERCEIVE VERY WELL UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE FORMER INTIMACY SHE BEGAN GRADUALLY TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS THINGS WHY ARABELLA TREFOIL HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO COME TO MISTLETOE JUST AT THIS TIME
A RUSTIC BANQUETING HALL WAS PREPARED AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY NICE TONS OF GAME HAD BEEN KILLED AND TONS MORE WERE TO BE KILLED AFTER LUNCHEON THE DUCHESS WAS NOT THERE AND ARABELLA CONTRIVED SO TO PLACE HERSELF THAT SHE COULD BE WAITED UPON BY LORD RUFFORD OR COULD WAIT UPON HIM
A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS OPEN THE SENATOR WHO WAS PREPARING HIS LECTURE IN HIS MIND AT ONCE ASKED WHETHER NO ONE IN ENGLAND HAD AN APPARATUS FOR WARMING ROOMS SUCH AS WAS TO BE FOUND IN EVERY WELL BUILT HOUSE IN THE STATES
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS A TREFOIL AND HER PRESENCE THEREFORE RAISED NO QUESTION THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM WAS AMONG THE GUESTS THE DUCHESS KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AND VOUCHSAFED TO HER THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE RECOGNITION LADY CHILTERN HAD MET HER BEFORE
IS THE YOUNG LADY MISS TREFOIL I DID NOT MEAN TO MENTION ANY NAME TILL I WAS SURE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT IT IS MISS TREFOIL ELEANOR HAD TOLD ME SOMETHING OF IT
BUT SHE COULD NOT VENTURE TO ASK FOR IT SHE HAD STRETCHED HER MEANS AND HER CREDIT TO THE UTMOST IN REGARD TO HER WARDROBE AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO WELL EQUIPPED SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS OF HER CAREER
AND THE SENATOR AND THE PARAGON WERE NOW RETURNING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS BRAGTON THE FOX HAD TRIED HIS OLD EARTHS AT IMPINGTON HIGH WOOD AND HAD THEN SKULKED BACK ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE COVERT HAD NOT ONE OF THE WHIPS SEEN HIM
HE HAD NOT AS YET KNOWN ANY COMFORT AND WAS STILL FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF SELLING THE FARM HE HAD BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE OR TWICE BUT FANCIED THAT PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PECULIAR EYES
LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE CAPTAIN THE FOX HAS GONE ON TO THE GORSE SAID THE ELDER BOTSEY WHAT A STUPID OLD PIG HE IS MEANING THAT TONY TUPPETT WAS THE PIG HE WAS SEEN GOING ON SAID LARRY WHO HAD COME ACROSS A MAN MENDING A DRAIN
THE MAJOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE GROUND TRIED IT AT AN IMPRACTICABLE PLACE AND BROUGHT HIS MARE DOWN BUT SHE FELL AT THE RIGHT SIDE AND HE WAS QUICK ENOUGH IN GETTING AWAY FROM HER NOT TO FALL UNDER HER IN THE DITCH
SUCH A THING HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT ON ANY OF THOSE ANNUAL VISITS WHICH SHE HAD MADE TO MISTLETOE FOR MORE YEARS THAN SHE NOW LIKED TO THINK OF SHE HAD EVER HAD FIVE MINUTES CONVERSATION ALONE WITH HER AUNT
OF COURSE SUCH A THING CANNOT BE ARRANGED WITHOUT BEING TALKED ABOUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ARRANGED IF YOU DON'T MEAN TO HAVE IT ARRANGED YOU HAD BETTER LOOK TO IT I AM SPEAKING IN EARNEST RUFFORD I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP AUTHORITIES INDEED IF I DID
THE MAJOR GRUNTED AS HE RODE ON FINDING NO NECESSITY HERE EVEN FOR HIS CUSTOMARY TWO WORDS LITTLE ACCIDENTS SUCH AS THAT WERE THE PRICE HE PAID FOR HIS DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT AS THEY GOT WITHIN VIEW OF LITTLETON GORSE HAMPTON
AH YES I DARE SAY THAT WAS THE NAME I HEARD UP THERE YOU ARE NOT MISTER TWENTYMAN SIR MY NAME IS MORTON
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE PROPERTY MAMMA A NASTY BEGGARLY PLACE AND FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS HE'S SURE TO BE A MINISTER OR AMBASSADOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
PERHAPS HE LIKED IT BUT ANY MAN ENDOWED WITH THAT POWER OF APPRECIATION WHICH WE CALL SYMPATHY WOULD HAVE FELT IT TO BE AS COLD AS THOUGH IT HAD COME FROM A FIGURE ON A GLASS WINDOW THE DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED
THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS SUCH FRIENDS WITH THE SQUIRE AS THAT WELL THERE IT IS LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON AND MARY IS NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM
HAD NOT THE PRESENCE OF THE POISONED FOX SHOWN THAT HE WAS RIGHT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO PAY SAID LARRY
HE DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY FOUND OR NOT AND WHEN CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS HELD TO HAVE DISGRACED HIMSELF THOROUGHLY BY WASTING AN HOUR IN DIGGING OUT AND THEN KILLING A VIXEN HE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY ABOUT IT
NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO EXCEPT TO KEEP OUT OF THE GIRL'S WAY IF SHE TOOK ANY STEPS THEN HE MUST ACT BUT AS HE THOUGHT OF IT HE SWORE TO HIMSELF THAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO MARRY HER
WHO WAS IN TRUTH A GOOD HORSEMAN AND HE HAD THREE THINGS TO DO WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO COMBINE HE HAD A YOUNG HORSE WHICH HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SELL HE HAD TO COACH KATE MASTERS ON HIS PONY AND HE DESIRED TO RIDE LIKE MAJOR CANEBACK
WHAT FOOLS MEN MIGHT BE EVEN THOUGH THEY DID RIDE WELL TO HOUNDS
FIRST THE LAUGHING LETTER AND THEN THE ONE THAT WAS DECLARED TO BE SERIOUS THE EARLIER OF THE TWO DID NOT ANNOY HIM MUCH IT CONTAINED HARDLY MORE THAN THOSE FORMER LETTERS WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO GO TO MISTLETOE
LORD RUFFORD HAD BEEN RIDING A VERY BIG CHESTNUT HORSE AND HAD WATCHED THE ANXIOUS STRUGGLES OF KATE MASTERS TO HOLD HER PLACE KATE THOUGH FIFTEEN AND QUITE UP TO THAT AGE IN INTELLIGENCE AND IMPUDENCE WAS SMALL AND LOOKED ALMOST A CHILD
OR WHAT HAS SHE SAID TO YOU THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL MORE OF THE LATTER THAN THE FORMER I SAY SO TO YOU BUT OF COURSE IT IS NOT TO BE SAID THAT I HAVE SAID SO I CANNOT GO FORTH TO THE WORLD COMPLAINING OF A YOUNG LADY'S CONDUCT TO ME
HE COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO THIS BECAUSE THE DUCHESS CALLED HIM AWAY TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT TO LADY CHILTERN ABOUT GOARLY AND THE U R U LADY CHILTERN'S HUSBAND BEING A MASTER OF HOUNDS AND A GREAT AUTHORITY ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO HUNTING NASTY OLD DRAGON
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE FEW HUMAN BEINGS WHO SEEM NEVER TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHATEVER HE PUT HIS HAND TO CAME OUT WELL AND YET EVERYBODY LIKED HIM HIS BROTHER IN LAW WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM BUT YET WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM
I KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL KNOW LORD RUFFORD VERY WELL AS ONE DOES KNOW MEN THAT ONE MEETS ABOUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT SETTLE EVERYTHING IF WE HAD MISTER MORTON HERE I COULDN'T MEET HIM AUNT I COULDN'T INDEED
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW A MAN IS TO DO IT UNLESS IT'S BORN WITH HIM A LITTLE PRUDENCE I SHOULD SAY YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL A FELLOW THAT IT IS HIS DUTY TO BE SIX FEET HIGH BUT WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO THE YOUNG LADY
THAT HER ONLY ESCAPE FROM HOME WOULD BE BY BECOMING MISSUS TWENTYMAN I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE MISTER MORTON MY AUNT WILL BE VERY SORRY OH HOW SORRY SHALL I BE
YOU'LL FIND THAT WILL COME ALL RIGHT AFTER YOU ARE MARRIED LIKE YOU AND PAPA I SUPPOSE MY DEAR I HAD NO MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME OR I SHOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED YOUR FATHER I WISH YOU HADN'T BECAUSE THEN I SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO MARRY MISTER MORTON
THIS KIND OF THINGS I BELIEVE CAN BE BOUGHT AND SOLD IN THE MARKET SAID THE SENATOR SPEAKING EVERY WORD WITH ABSOLUTE DISTINCTNESS BUT AS HE PAUSED FOR AN ANSWER THE TWO LADIES CAME IN AND THE CONVERSATION WAS CHANGED
BECAUSE LADY USHANT IS KIND TO ME I NEEDN'T EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SO REGINALD MORTON WAS OF COURSE THE OTHER PEOPLE THEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT I DID SO LONG HE SAID
TONY WHOSE FAULT WAS A TENDENCY TO MYSTERY AS IS THE FAULT OF MOST HUNTSMEN HAVING ACCOMPLISHED HIS OBJECT IN STOPPING THE HOUNDS PRETENDED TO CAST ABOUT WITH GREAT DILIGENCE HE CROSSED THE ROAD AND WAS DOWN ONE SIDE OF A FIELD AND ALONG ANOTHER
A PARISH WHICH RAN INTO DILLSBOROUGH AND COMPREHENDED A PART OF ITS POPULATION WAS LISTENING TO THESE QUERIES WITH AWE AND PERHAPS WITH SOME LITTLE GRATIFICATION AS HE HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIS LIVING BY THE BISHOP AFTER A CURACY OF MANY YEARS
AND OF HER SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TO HIS BEDSIDE OF COURSE SHE WOULD GO THOUGH SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH SATISFACTION TO A MEETING WITH THE HONBLE MISSUS MORTON
BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT NEITHER SHOULD HE TALK OF HAVING BEEN CLOSE TO ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD THE BEST OF IT LORD RUFFORD WHO DIDN'T TALK MUCH OF THESE THINGS QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FULL VALUE FOR HIS BILLET AND MOUNT IN THE IMPROVED CHARACTER OF HIS MARE
NOW SHE HAD TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HER OWN HANDS AND HAD DONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE RUINOUS IF NOT SUCCESSFUL
I'M SICK OF BOTH THE BOTSEYS CONTINUED THE LORD THINKING MORE OF HIS PARTY THAN OF MISTER MORTON'S HEALTH PUREFOY IS STILL SULKY WITH ME BECAUSE HE KILLED POOR OLD CANEBACK THEN HAMPTON SUGGESTED THAT IF HE WOULD ASK
THAT EVENING LORD RUFFORD WAS VERY GOOD NATURED AND MANAGED TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING LADY CHILTERN AND ANOTHER LADY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO GO TO THE MEET
AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
IN EXACTING CONTINUED HOMAGE FROM THE MAN HOMAGE FOR THE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF HIS SOJOURN AT MISTLETOE THIS MUST BE CARRIED ON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF MANY IN THE HOUSE THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO THAT HORRID PATAGONIAN MINISTER
WHEN THE LADIES WENT UP STAIRS THE AFTERNOON WAS NOT HALF OVER AND THEY DID NOT DINE TILL PAST SEVEN AS MORTON RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN THE DUSK HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS ARABELLA MIGHT MAKE SOME ATTEMPT TO THROW HERSELF IN HIS WAY
NOW MISTLETOE WAS IN LINCOLNSHIRE NOT VERY FAR FROM PETERBOROUGH NOT VERY FAR FROM STAMFORD NOT VERY FAR FROM OAKHAM A REGULAR HUNTING MAN LIKE LORD RUFFORD KNEW HOW TO COMPASS THE DIFFICULTIES OF DISTANCE IN ALL HUNTING COUNTRIES
OF COURSE HE MUST FURNISH THE PLACE AND HAVE AN IMMENSE DEAL DONE BEFORE HE CAN MARRY I THINK IT IS A PIECE OF IMPUDENCE TO BRING ONE TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT'S NONSENSE MAMMA BECAUSE HE TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT
DURING THAT TIME SHE WOULD CURRY FAVOUR WITH HER UNCLE BY ALL HER ARTS AND WOULD IF POSSIBLE RECONCILE HERSELF TO HER AUNT SHE THOUGHT ONCE OF TAKING HER AUNT INTO HER FULL CONFIDENCE AND BALANCED THE MATTER MUCH IN HER MIND
AND MADE HERSELF AGREEABLE TO THAT OLD GENTLEMAN IN A REMARKABLE MANNER AFTER DINNER SOMETHING HAVING BEEN SAID OF THE RESPECTABLE OLD GAME CALLED CAT'S CRADLE SHE PLAYED IT TO PERFECTION WITH SIR JEFFREY TILL HER AUNT THOUGHT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN UNAWARE
NOW HAD COME HIS DIFFICULTY WHAT MUST HE DO HOW SHOULD HE ANSWER IT WAS IT IMPERATIVE ON HIM TO WRITE THE WORDS WITH HIS OWN HAND WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD GET HIS SISTER TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION
AFTER THE ESCAPING FOX BEFORE A HOUND WAS OUT OF THE COVERT THEY SETTLED AGAIN TO THEIR BUSINESS IT WAS PRETTY TO SEE THE QUIET EASE AND APPARENT NONCHALANCE
HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD SAID SOME WORD TO HIM IN JOKE AS TO HIS ATTACHMENT TO MISS TREFOIL AND AFTER THE LADIES HAD LEFT THE ROOM ANOTHER NEIGHBOUR OF THE OTHER SEX HAD HOPED THAT HE HAD HAD A PLEASANT TIME ON THE ROAD
HE INTENDS TO COME HOME SOMETIMES I SUPPOSE AND IF HE DIDN'T YOU WOULD LADY AUGUSTUS WAS NOT GOING TO LET HER DAUGHTER MARRY A MAN WHO COULD NOT GIVE HER A HOME FOR AT ANY RATE A PART OF THE YEAR
HE HAS GONE HIS WAY AND I HAVE GONE MINE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE PRAY REMEMBER ME TO HIM LADY AUGUSTUS SAID SHE WOULD AND DID ENTERTAIN SOME LITTLE INCREASED RESPECT FOR THE CLERGYMAN WHO COULD BOAST THAT HE HAD BEEN TIPSY IN COMPANY
MISTER MORTON SIR I THINK IS OUT WITH THE LADIES TAKING A DRIVE I WILL LEAVE A CARD THEN THE OLD LADY IS AT HOME SIR IF YOU WISH TO SEE HER CONTINUED THE SENATOR FOLLOWING REGINALD UP TO THE DOOR
THE MORE I SEE OF IT ALL ARABELLA
WHAT MAN EVER HAS TO WORK AS I DO I WONDER WHICH WAS THE HARDEST PART OF THAT WORK THE HAIRDRESSING AND PAINTING AND COMPANIONSHIP OF THE LADY'S MAID OR THE CONTINUAL SMILING UPON UNMARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
ARE WE TO HAVE A WEEK OF THIS SAID LADY AUGUSTUS WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF UP STAIRS YOU MUST MAMMA IF WE ARE TO STAY TILL WE GO TO THE GORES LORD RUFFORD IS HERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER YES THEY DO SLIGHTLY
SHE COULD SEE BY HER AUNT'S EYE AND HEAR IN HER VOICE THAT SHE WAS IN PART DETECTED AND THAT SHE WOULD DO HERSELF NO FURTHER SERVICE BY ACTING THE GOOD GIRL AND SHE THEREFORE RESOLUTELY DETERMINED TO LISTEN TO NO MORE TWADDLE SHE READ A FRENCH NOVEL WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
AND NOW SHE WAS TO MEET HIM IN THE HOUSE OF HER GREAT RELATIONS IN A POSITION IN WHICH HER RANK AND HER FASHION WOULD SEEM TO BE EQUAL TO HIS OWN AND SHE WOULD MEET HIM WITH THE REMEMBRANCE FRESH IN HIS MIND AS IN HER OWN OF THOSE PASSAGES OF LOVE AT RUFFORD
WHEN THE PONY PAUSED AT THE BIG BROOK BROUGHT HIS FOUR LEGS STEADILY DOWN ON THE BRINK AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO BATHE THEN WITH A BEND OF HIS BACK LEAPED TO THE OTHER SIDE DROPPING HIS HIND LEGS IN AND INSTANTLY RECOVERING THEM
SAID THAT HE AND ANOTHER INTENDED TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE UPON THIS LORD RUFFORD TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT ARABELLA MOURNFULLY CANNOT I GO BY TRAIN TO OUNDLE SHE ASKED NOTHING ON EARTH SO JOLLY IF YOUR PASTORS AND MASTERS AND ALL THAT WILL LET YOU
AND HURRIED DOWN THE DITCH TO THE SPOT WHICH TONY HAD CHOSEN AND WHICH WAS NOW CROWDED BY HORSEMEN HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT AS WELL AS THE BEST OF THEM SAID KATE PANTING FOR BREATH WE'RE ALL RIGHT SAID LARRY FOLLOW ME DON'T LET THEM HUSTLE YOU OUT
CAPTAIN GLOMAX HAD GOT INTO IT AND CAME UP AFTERWARDS WET THROUGH WITH TEMPER BY NO MEANS IMPROVED BUT THE GLORY OF THE DAY HAD BEEN THE WAY IN WHICH LORD RUFFORD'S YOUNG BAY MARE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A BROOK BEFORE
THE GIRL WAS HIS NIECE AND THE DUKE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE KIND TO THE FAMILY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HAD BECOME OBJECTIONABLE TO HIM BUT AS TO THE GIRL IF SHE WANTED A HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO HE THOUGHT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER
RATHER SLOW QUICK SPURT GOODISH THING REGULARLY MULLED AND SUCH LIKE NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A GREAT THING TO HAVE MAJOR CANEBACK WITH YOU TO THE LIST OF THOSE WHO RODE WELL AND QUIETLY
COME TO MORROW AND HAVE A GOSSIP WITH THE GIRLS TOGETHER AND SHOW THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLUCK UP THAT'S THE WAY TO WIN HER LARRY DID GO TO THE CLUB AND DID THINK VERY MUCH OF IT AS HE WALKED HOME
WHERE IS PELTRY IT'S A COTTESMORE MEET ABOUT FIVE MILES THIS SIDE OF MELTON WE COULD RIDE FROM HERE IT'S RATHER FAR FOR THAT BUT WE COULD TALK OVER THE DUKE TO SEND A CARRIAGE LADIES ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE A MEET AND PERHAPS WE COULD MAKE A PARTY
THAT SUCH A FOX AS HE HAD BEFORE HIM WOULDN'T STAY THERE TWO MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST HOUND WAS IN IT AND THAT DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WHICH TO HIS IMAGINATION WAS FULL OF POISON WOULD THEN BE ONLY A MILE AND A HALF BEFORE HIM
TO WALK ROUND THE OLD PLACE WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY BEFORE THESE PEOPLE CAME THERE AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WOULD NOT COME WITH ME I WAS COMING BUT YOU WENT BACK WITH THAT OTHER MAN
WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER MORTON AND NOW SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THESE HORRID QUESTIONS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO WITH HIM AUNT THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CERTAIN JUST AT PRESENT
I NEVER GAMBLE AND THEREFORE NO OTHER SCRAPE CAN BE AWFUL A YOUNG LADY WANTS TO MARRY ME THAT IS NOT UNNATURAL BUT I AM QUITE DETERMINED LET THE RESULT BE WHAT IT MAY THAT I WON'T MARRY THE YOUNG LADY
HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO TO MISTLETOE NOR TO STAY SO LONG WITH HIS FRIEND SURBITON BUT NOW HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO BE BACK AT RUFFORD HALL WHERE AT PRESENT HIS SISTER WAS STAYING WITH HER HUSBAND SIR GEORGE PENWETHER
THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEIR ELDER SISTER WHILE THE ASSURANCE WAS STILL WITH THEM THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO FORGIVE THEM BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED BY BOTH OF THEM THAT POOR LAWRENCE HAD NO CHANCE
THIS SHE SAID AS THOUGH THE NEWS MUST BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO LARRY TWENTYMAN HE STOOD FOR AWHILE SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AS HE THOUGHT OF IT
AND YOU'LL GET RID OF ALL THAT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT CAN I SAY TO THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I KISSED HER OF COURSE I ENCOURAGED HOPES NO DOUBT
IN ALL THESE DISPUTES HE NEVER QUITE YIELDED THOUGH HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM HE WAS STILL FIRM HE WOULD TURN HIS BACK TO HIS WIFE AND LET HER RUN ON WITH HER ARGUMENTS WITHOUT A WORD OF ANSWER
SHE WOULD FALL INTO MY ARMS SHE WOULD EMBRACE ME SHE PERSISTED IN ASKING ME WHETHER I LOVED HER THOUGH A MAN HAVE TO BE SHOT FOR IT OR KICKED FOR IT OR EVEN THOUGH HE HAVE TO ENDURE PERPETUAL SCORN FOR IT
WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER THE DUKE'S WORD DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND A PARTY NUMBERING ABOUT THIRTY WALKED AWAY INTO THE DINNER ROOM ARABELLA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETTLED FOUND THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT NEXT HERSELF IF THE MAN WERE TO COME FORTUNE WOULD HAVE FAVOURED HER IN THAT
THEY WERE SAD AND DOWNHEARTED IN ALL THAT MISERY THE POOR ATTORNEY HAD THE WORST OF IT MARY WAS FREE FROM HER STEPMOTHER'S ZEAL AND HER STEPMOTHER'S PERSECUTION AT ANY RATE AT NIGHT
WOULD SHE BE TAKEN ROUND TO SEE THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS RUFFORD AND NORRINGTON LORD RUFFORD LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR RUFFORD SHE ASKED YES HE LIVED AT RUFFORD HALL THREE OR FOUR MILES FROM THE TOWN DID LORD RUFFORD HUNT
VERY SERVANTS SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNOW IT AND THERE ISN'T A GROOM OR HORSEBOY ABOUT WHO ISN'T IN HIS HEART
OF COURSE I DID WHEN YOU SHOWED SO PLAINLY THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO JOIN YOU WHAT WAS I TO DO I COULDN'T SEND HIM AWAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF OURS AND VERY KIND TO DOLLY AND KATE
AT ANY RATE I WILL WRITE TO LADY USHANT AND WILL ASK PAPA TO LET YOU KNOW THEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM BUT TO GO AND YET HE WANTED TO SAY SOME OTHER WORD
BRAZIL OR THE WEST INDIES OR SOME BRITISH COLONY SAID HER LADYSHIP SHOWING HER IGNORANCE OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE SERVICE THAT MIGHT BE VERY WELL YOU COULD STAY AT HOME ONLY WHERE WOULD YOU LIVE HE WOULDN'T KEEP A HOUSE IN TOWN FOR YOU
I CAN EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AND SHE WILL UNDERSTAND ME SHE HARDLY MEANT TO REPROACH HIM SHE DID NOT MEAN TO ASSUME AN INTIMACY SUFFICIENT FOR REPROACH BUT HE FELT THAT SHE HAD REPROACHED HIM
AND THAT SHE HAD SAID IT ON PURPOSE TO PUNISH THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HER NOT A DAY PASSED OR HARDLY AN HOUR OF A DAY IN WHICH SHE DID NOT TELL HERSELF THAT THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED AND THE EARLY ASSOCIATIONS OF HER LIFE
THOUGH HE SHOULD RESOLVE TO PASS FIVE YEARS AMONG THE ANDES HE MUST ANSWER THE LADY'S LETTER BEFORE HE WENT THEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TELL EVERYTHING TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AS FAR AS EVERYTHING CAN BE TOLD IN SUCH A MATTER
WAS THE VERY WAY TO PROMOTE THE DISEASE THIS MISSUS MASTERS SAID IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON NIGHT AND DAY TILL THE POOR HUSBAND LONGED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE
HE CANNOT SAY THAT LET IT BE EVER SO TRUE AND YET IS A MAN TO BE FORCED INTO A MARRIAGE WHICH HE DESPISES HE WOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO THE MARRIAGE AND THE SOONER HE RETREATED
NEAR TO THEM AND WHICH AS HE KNEW RAN WITHIN ONE FIELD OF THE GORSE HE HAD LOST HIS PLACE AND HAD GOT A DUCKING AND WAS A LITTLE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH THINGS IN GENERAL IT HAD NOT BEEN HIS PURPOSE TO GO TO IMPINGTON ON THIS DAY
AMONG WHOM WERE ESPECIALLY TO BE NAMED YOUNG HAMPTON AND THE ELDER BOTSEY AND LORD RUFFORD AND ABOVE ALL A DARK VISAGED LONG WHISKERED SOMBRE MILITARY MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH LORD RUFFORD
BUT SAINT ANTHONY WOULD HAVE HAD TO KISS THIS YOUNG WOMAN IF SHE HAD MADE HER ATTACK UPON HIM AS SHE DID ON ME AND AFTER ALL A KISS DOESN'T GO FOR EVERYTHING THESE ARE THINGS PENWETHER THAT MUST NOT BE INQUIRED INTO TOO CURIOUSLY
THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG LADIES WHO WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE RICH AND TO HAVE A TITLE AND A BIG HOUSE AND A COMMAND OF LUXURIES ONE SOMETIMES FEELS ONESELF LIKE A CARCASE IN THE MIDST OF VULTURES MARRY AFTER A PROPER FASHION
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN SEEING MARY HE LEARNED HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE ALL AWARE THAT THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO MISSUS MASTERS IT SEEMED THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN A DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE
LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON I SUPPOSE THAT POOR MAN IS DYING HE IS VERY ILL CERTAINLY
I SAY WE DID FIND IN DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WE FOUND A FOX THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THE POOR BRUTE WAS DEAD
AND MUCH BLOWING OF HORNS AND PRAYERS FROM CAPTAIN GLOMAX THAT GENTLEMEN WOULD ONLY BE SO GOOD AS TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND A FULL TONGUED VOLLEY OF ABUSE FROM HALF THE FIELD AGAINST AN UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN WHO RODE
SOME OF US ARE VERY WET SAID NED THAT'S PART OF THE FUN OH
THE SATURDAY WAS THE DAY OF THE GREAT SHOOTING AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THE LADIES WENT OUT TO LUNCH WITH THE GENTLEMEN BY THE SIDE OF THE WOOD LORD RUFFORD HAD AT LAST CONSENTED TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY WITH LOGS OF TREES A FEW HURDLES AND OTHER FIELD APPLIANCES
YOU LIVE IN THESE PARTS SIR ASKED THE SENATOR IN THE TOWN YONDER BECAUSE MISTER MORTON'S HOUSEKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW YOU SHE KNOWS ME VERY WELL AS I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
FROM IMPINGTON PARK THEY WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO LITTLETON GORSE SKIRTING CERTAIN SMALL WOODS WHICH THE FOX DISDAINED TO ENTER HERE THE PACE WAS VERY GOOD AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL GRASS IT WAS THE VERY CREAM OF THE U R U
HIS OLD FRIEND TOM SURBITON SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SENDING HIM BACK TO RUFFORD THEY HAD SAT OUT THE REST OF THE MEN WHO FORMED THE PARTY AND WERE ALONE IN THE SMOKING ROOM SO YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY MISS TREFOIL SAID TOM SURBITON
HE REMAINED A COUPLE OF DAYS IN TOWN AND REACHED RUFFORD HALL ON THE MONDAY JUST A WEEK FROM THE DAY OF THAT FATAL MEET AT PELTRY THERE HE FOUND SIR GEORGE AND HIS SISTER AND MISS PENGE AND SPENT HIS FIRST EVENING IN QUIET
WITH THE HELP OF TWO COUNTRYMEN AND THE MAJOR WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FALL TILL HE WAS FORCED TO OPEN HIS MOUTH DOUBLE DITCH MARE FELL MATTER OF COURSE AND THEN HE GOT HIMSELF OUT OF THE CROWD DISGUSTED WITH THE LITTLENESS OF MANKIND
AND A COMPROMISE HAD BEEN MADE WITH LADY AUGUSTUS BY WHICH SHE AND HER DAUGHTER SHOULD BE ALLOWED A FORTNIGHT EVERY YEAR AT THE DUKE'S PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENTERTAINMENT IN TOWN I REMEMBER THE DUKE AT CHRISTCHURCH SAID THE PARSON
MISTLETOE IS AN ENORMOUS HOUSE WITH A FRONTAGE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG COMBINING AS IT DOES ALL THE OFFICES COACH HOUSES AND STABLES THERE IS NOTHING IN ENGLAND MORE UGLY OR PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE
AND COULD THE SENATOR HAVE READ THE FEELINGS OF THE DOZEN LEADING MEN IN THE RUN HE WOULD HAVE OWNED THAT THEY WERE FOR THE TIME SATISFIED WITH THEIR AMUSEMENT COULD HE HAVE READ KATE MASTERS FEELINGS HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO OWN THAT SHE WAS IN AN EARTHLY PARADISE
SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID AT PRESENT AFTER WHAT ARABELLA HAD TOLD HER MISTER MORTON COULD NOT BE ASKED THERE TO MEET HER NIECE BUT ALL THE SLIGHT FEELING OF KINDNESS TO THE GIRL WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE TIDINGS OF SO RESPECTABLE AN ENGAGEMENT
AND IT ISN'T GENERALLY THE CUSTOM TO HAVE FOX COVERTS POISONED SAID THE CAPTAIN ASSUMING TO HIMSELF THE CREDIT DUE TO TONY'S SAGACITY IF YOU WISH TO BE MASTER OF THESE HOUNDS I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION
AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT LARRY HAD WAITED JUST A MOMENT FOR HER WATCHING TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE HER FATE SHE WAS IN HEAVEN WASN'T IT A BIG ONE LARRY SHE ASKED IN HER TRIUMPH HE DID GO IN BEHIND THOSE CATS OF THINGS ALWAYS DO IT SOMEHOW LARRY REPLIED
OF COURSE ONE CANNOT TELL IT ALL DOWN TO EACH MAWKISH WORD OF HUMBUGGING SENTIMENT THERE ARE HER LETTERS AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER IS THAT I NEVER ASKED HER TO BE MY WIFE AND THAT NO CONSIDERATION ON EARTH SHALL INDUCE ME TO BECOME HER HUSBAND
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY PASTORS AND MASTERS THE DUCHESS SUGGESTED LORD RUFFORD I THOUGHT ALL THAT KIND OF NONSENSE WAS OVER SAID ARABELLA I BELIEVE A GREAT DEAL IS OVER YOU CAN DO MANY THINGS THAT YOUR MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T DO BUT ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
IT ISN'T GENERALLY THE CUSTOM HERE TO TAKE THE HOUNDS OFF A RUNNING FOX CONTINUED BOTSEY
HE REMEMBERED WITH FAIR ACCURACY ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING THE JOURNEY FROM STAMFORD TO MISTLETOE HE FELT ASSURED THAT UP TO THAT TIME HE HAD SAID NOTHING WHICH COULD BE TAKEN TO MEAN A REAL DECLARATION OF LOVE ALL THAT AT RUFFORD HAD BEEN NOTHING
HE DECIDED THAT HE MUST AT ONCE RETREAT OR ELSE MAKE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY THE YOUNG LADY AND THEREFORE HE RETREATED HE BREAKFASTED THAT MORNING AT THE INN AT STAMFORD AND AS HE SMOKED HIS CIGAR AFTERWARDS
LADY USHANT WROTE TO POSTPONE THE VISIT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO BRAGTON HER LETTER TO MARY THOUGH AFFECTIONATE WAS VERY SHORT HER GRAND NEPHEW JOHN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
THEY'RE GOING HOME HE SAID AS SOON AS HE HAD JOINED LORD RUFFORD AND THE CROWD GOING HOME EXCLAIMED A PINK COATED YOUNG RIDER OF A HIRED HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN GOING WELL WITH HIM AND AS HE SAID SO HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
THEN LADY AUGUSTUS THREW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND WENT TO SLEEP OR PRETENDED TO DO SO A LITTLE AFTER HALF PAST SEVEN SHE AND HER DAUGHTER DRESSED FOR DINNER WENT DOWN TO THE LIBRARY TOGETHER
BUT ON THIS WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED A LETTER AND AS HE TOLD HIMSELF MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT LETTER HE CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE AND ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS
BUT WE HAD A NICE LITTLE SKURRY FOR FOUR OR FIVE MILES SOME OF YOU LOOK VERY WET CAPTAIN GLOMAX AND NED BOTSEY WERE STANDING NEAR THE CARRIAGE BUT THE CAPTAIN AS SOON AS HE HEARD THIS BROKE INTO A TROT AND FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS
ON THAT SAME WEDNESDAY REGINALD MORTON HAD CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE HAD ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS AND HAD FOUND HER ALONE MISSUS MASTERS AT THE TIME HAD BEEN OUT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH MUST BE NARRATED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER THE SENATOR LIFTED HIS HAT AND REMARKED THAT IT WAS A VERY FINE AFTERNOON REGINALD LIFTED HIS HAT AND ASSENTED
AGAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS OBSERVED HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING A FEW WORDS TO ARABELLA AS SHE LAY ON THE SOFA NOT TO DO SO AFTER WHAT HAD OCCURRED WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ITSELF PECULIAR BUT WHEN HE DID SO
SHE THOUGHT OF IT ALL AND MADE HER PLANS CAREFULLY AND EVEN PAINFULLY
PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AREN'T THEY PERHAPS LADIES ARE WE WERE BUT ALL THAT ABOUT THE CARRIAGES MISTER MORTON WASN'T MY DOING MAMMA HAD BEEN TALKING TO ME SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS
IT MIGHT BE SAID NO DOUBT WOULD BE SAID THAT HE BEHAVED BADLY THAT WOULD BE SAID BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE OPEN TO HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH THE LADY IN SUCH A CASE CAN ALWAYS TELL HER STORY
AND FOR WHOM SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST CARE I CAN'T DO IT ANY MORE AND I WON'T AS FOR MISTER MORTON I DON'T CARE THAT FOR HIM YOU KNOW I DON'T I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR ANYBODY
FOR SOME PERSONS TALK IN A VERY THOUGHTLESS WAY AND WITHOUT PERHAPS INTENDING TO BE EXACTLY UNTRUTHFUL SAY A GREAT DEAL THAT THEY REALLY DO NOT MEAN AND I SHOULD BE SORRY INDEED TO SEE MY LITTLE GIRL SO SPOILED BY ALL THIS SILLY FLATTERY
HOW DOES MY LITTLE DAUGHTER DO THIS EVENING HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES GREW BRIGHT WITH HAPPINESS AND SHE LONGED TO THROW HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND TELL HIM HOW VERY VERY MUCH SHE LOVED HIM BUT THAT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE TABLE AND BEFORE ALL THE FAMILY
HAVE I NOT SAID ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU OF YOUR DUTY HE ASKED YES PAPA I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
THAN SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY IN PLAY ELSIE DID KEENLY ENJOY THAT QUIET HOUR SPENT IN STUDYING AND RECITING TO HER FATHER SITTING ON A LOW STOOL AT HIS FEET OR PERHAPS OFTENER ON HIS KNEE WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST
BUT COWED BY HIS BROTHER'S DETERMINED LOOK AND MANNER HE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OBEYED NOW SIR SAID MISTER DINSMORE WHEN HE HAD HIM FAIRLY IN THE ROOM AND HAD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM I WISH TO KNOW HOW YOU CAME TO MEDDLE WITH ELSIE'S COPY BOOK
ELSIE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH A LIGHT HEART A HEART THAT THRILLED WITH A NEW AND STRANGE SENSE OF HAPPINESS AS SHE REMEMBERED HER FATHER'S EVIDENT ANXIETY FOR HER SAFETY DURING THEIR PERILOUS RIDE RECALLING EACH WORD AND LOOK
THE LITTLE WEEPER ANSWERED EAGERLY SMILING THROUGH HER TEARS ELSIE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND WAS BACK AGAIN ALMOST IN A MOMENT WITH THE DOLL IN HER ARMS THERE DEAR LITTLE FLORA SHE SAID LAYING IT GENTLY ON THE CHILD'S LAP
AND HE ANSWERED BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED
HE WAS NOT USUALLY VERY FOND OF READING
AND MADE HIM LOSE HIS BIRD AND HOW MUCH OH HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM BUT I KNOW I NEVER COULD TELL HIM THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT NO WORDS COULD I AM SURE AND IF HE WOULD FORGIVE ME AND KISS ME AND CALL ME HIS DEAR LITTLE DAUGHTER
MUST IT ALWAYS BE THUS WAS HER CRAVING FOR AFFECTION NEVER TO BE SATISFIED O PAPA MY OWN PAPA WILL YOU NEVER LOVE ME MOURNED THE SAD LITTLE HEART AH IF I COULD ONLY BE GOOD ALWAYS PERHAPS HE WOULD
UNTIL HER FATHER SUDDENLY LIFTED HER FROM HER SEAT AND PLACING HER BETWEEN HIS KNEES HELD HER TIGHTLY AS THOUGH HE FEARED SHE WOULD BE SNATCHED FROM HIS GRASP ELSIE LOOKED UP INTO HIS FACE
HALF HOPING FOR PERMISSION TO STAY UP A LITTLE LONGER YES DAUGHTER KEEP TO RULES
BUT JES YOU LIE STILL TILL IT GETS WARM HERE I'LL OPEN DE SHUTTERS AN FOTCH SOME MORE WOOD FOR DE FIRE AN CLAR UP DE ROOM AN BY DAT TIME I RECKON YOU CAN GET UP ELSIE WAITED PATIENTLY TILL CHLOE PRONOUNCED THE ROOM WARM ENOUGH
I WILL COME FOR MY GOOD NIGHT KISS BEFORE YOU ARE ASLEEP ELSIE LOOKED VERY GLAD AND WENT AWAY FEELING HERSELF THE HAPPIEST LITTLE GIRL IN THE LAND IN SPITE OF THE ANNOYANCE OF BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THE MERRY GROUP IN THE NURSERY
SHE DROPPED HER HEAD ON HIS BREAST AND BURST INTO TEARS AND SOBS WHY ELSIE MY OWN DARLING WHAT AILS YOU HE ASKED IN GREAT SURPRISE
HE ASKED IN A COLD GRAVE TONE YES SIR I WILL TRY TO BE A GOOD GIRL ALWAYS SAID THE HUMBLE LITTLE VOICE THEN I WILL FORGIVE YOU HE REPLIED TAKING THE HANDKERCHIEF OFF HER HAND STILL ELSIE LINGERED
BLUSHES ARE VERY BECOMING OH YOU NEEDN'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE HANDSOME YOU'RE A PERFECT LITTLE BEAUTY DO TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET SUCH SPLENDID EYES BUT I NEEDN'T ASK FOR I HAVE ONLY TO LOOK AT YOUR FATHER TO SEE WHERE THEY CAME FROM
AS SHE HASTILY SET DOWN HER BROOM AND CAME TOWARD THE BED WITH A LOOK OF LOVING ANXIETY ON HER DARK FACE OH NO MAMMY I SLEPT NICELY AND FEEL AS WELL AS CAN BE REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL
SO THAT I ONLY HAD TIME TO THINK OF PAPA AND MYSELF AND I HAVE PRAYED SO MUCH FOR HIM
MISTER DINSMORE PASSED OUT OF ONE DOOR WHILE ELSIE LEFT BY THE OTHER THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED INQUIRINGLY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS ELSIE DONE ASKED CARRY IN A WHISPER I DON'T KNOW
AND HE LAUGHED AND STROKED HER HAIR
THAT SHE MIGHT GO TO HER PAPA
OH PLEASE DO SAY YES WE WANT TO GO SO VERY MUCH AND I'M SURE WE COULD DO VERY NICELY BY OURSELVES HER ARM WAS AROUND HIS NECK AND BOTH TONE AND LOOK WERE VERY COAXING
PLACING HER IN THE CARRIAGE SAID TO THE COACHMAN DRIVE CAREFULLY AJAX YOU ARE CARRYING MY GREATEST TREASURE NEBBER FEAR MARSTER
THE VERY PRETTIEST RING I EVER SAW YET I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER IS THERE NOT HE ASKED LOOKING SEARCHINGLY INTO HER FACE DEAR PAPA I LIKE IT VERY MUCH I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON THE TREE
ELSIE SAYS THESE BLOTS ARE NOT HER WORK CAN YOU TELL ME WHOSE THEY ARE MISS ELSIE GENERALLY TELLS THE TRUTH SIR REPLIED MISS DAY SARCASTICALLY BUT I MUST SAY THAT IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK SHE HAS FAILED AS HER DESK HAS A GOOD LOCK AND SHE HERSELF KEEPS THE KEY
YES PAPA I ATE A CRACKER AND I THINK I WILL NOT GET VERY HUNGRY BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK AND I'M VERY GLAD WE HAVE SO MUCH TIME FOR OUR WALK SHE REPLIED AS SHE TOOK HER PLACE ON HIS KNEE SHALL WE NOT START SOON PRESENTLY HE SAID STROKING HER HAIR
OF COURSE YOU WILL DENY IT SAID HIS BROTHER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT YOUR WORD IS GOOD FOR NOTHING PAPA
THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH A LITTLE TREMOR HOW ANGRY ARTHUR WOULD BE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND AFTER ALL SHE DID NOT STAND IN VERY GREAT DREAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY AS SHE FELT NEARLY SURE OF HER FATHER'S APPROVAL OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE
AND THEN GRADUALLY RETURNED TO HIS ORDINARY STERN COLD MANNER INDEED BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT SHE WAS AGAIN IN SAD DISGRACE SHE WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HER ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A SLIGHT FLUTTERING NOISE
AND WERE TOO MUCH ENGAGED TO NOTICE HER BUT AT LENGTH HER FATHER PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND WITH A KIND SMILE ASKED WHAT IS IT DAUGHTER
CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART O GOD AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT WITHIN ME WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS HE ASKED LOOKING AT HER WITH MINGLED SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION IN THE BIBLE SIR SHE MODESTLY REPLIED YOU SEEM TO HAVE READ IT TO SOME PURPOSE SAID HE
AH PAPA SHE ADDED IN HER OWN SWEET SIMPLE WAY I DO SO LOVE TO TALK OF JESUS TO TELL HIM ALL MY TROUBLES AND ASK HIM TO FORGIVE MY SINS AND MAKE ME HOLY AND THEN IT IS SO SWEET TO KNOW THAT HE LOVES ME AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE ME
I WAS THINKING SAID ELSIE GENTLY TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF HER LITTLE BIBLE AS SHE SPOKE OF THIS SWEET VERSE YEA THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME
BUT DREW IT BACK AGAIN AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT BALANCING IN HIS MIND THE CHANCES OF DETECTION HE COULD DEFACE ELSIE'S COPY BOOK BUT ADELAIDE COULD TESTIFY TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S CAREFULNESS AND THE NEATNESS OF HER WORK UP TO THAT VERY DAY FOR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL ROOM THAT MORNING DURING THE WRITING HOUR
AND SHE WAS EAGER TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION THEY MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED I AM SURE HE MUST LOVE YOU VERY DEARLY ELSIE REMARKED CAROLINE SOOTHINGLY NO ONE COULD HELP SEEING THAT JUST BY THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU ELSIE ANSWERED HER WITH A PLEASED AND GRATEFUL LOOK
I DON'T WANT ANY SUPPER PAPA SHE SAID HUMBLY HUSH HE REPLIED SEVERELY I WILL HAVE NO POUTING OR SULKING YOU MUST JUST EAT YOUR SUPPER AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
YES REMARKED TRAVILLA A TEXT HAS BEEN RUNNING IN MY HEAD EVER SINCE YOU COMMENCED YOUR CONVERSATION SOMETHING ABOUT THESE THINGS BEING HID FROM THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND REVEALED UNTO BABES AND HE ADDED
NOW MAMMY PLEASE PUT THEM ALL AWAY UNTIL TO MORROW BUT FIRST TAKE OFF MY THINGS AND GET ME READY TO GO DOWNSTAIRS NO DAUGHTER MISTER DINSMORE SAID IN A GENTLE BUT FIRM TONE
AND THUS BETWEEN WEEPING MOURNING AND PRAYING AN HOUR PASSED SLOWLY AWAY AND THE TEA BELL RANG ELSIE STARTED UP BUT SAT DOWN AGAIN FEELING THAT SHE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO WITHOUT HER SUPPER
ELSIE EXCLAIMED HER FATHER IN A TONE OF STERN REPROOF O PAPA HOW CAN I SHE SOBBED TREMBLING AND CLINGING TO HIS HAND AS SHE CAUGHT A THREATENING LOOK FROM ARTHUR COME COME CHILD YOU MUST TELL US ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SAID HER GRANDFATHER
WHEN ELSIE SEEING A GOLD CHAIN DEPENDING FROM THE POCKET OF ARTHUR'S JACKET EXCLAIMED
YES I DO SHE ANSWERED AND IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK OUT AT ONCE I SHALL SAVE ELSIE AND FIND MEANS TO PROVE YOUR GUILT AFTERWARDS
AND NOW SINCE YOU CONSIDER THAT CHANGE SO NECESSARY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT ALONE CAN CHANGE A SINNER'S HEART SIR AND HOW AM I TO SECURE HIS AID HE ASKED ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A TEXT
AND HE WOULD MAKE IT UP TO JIM SOMEHOW EVEN IF IT TOOK ALL HIS POCKET MONEY FOR A MONTH NONE OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HAD LEFT THE ROOM AND ALL WORE AN ANXIOUS EXPECTANT LOOK AS MISTER DINSMORE ENTERED LEADING ELSIE BY THE HAND
BUT REMEMBERING THAT HER FATHER TOLD HER SHE MUST WALK WITH THE OTHERS THAT AFTERNOON
INDEED IT DOES AND I FEEL RICHER IN THAT POSSESSION THAN ALL THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA COULD MAKE ME HE SAID PRESSING HER TO HIS HEART SHE LOOKED SURPASSINGLY LOVELY AT THAT MOMENT HER CHEEKS BURNING AND HER EYES SPARKLING WITH EXCITEMENT
IT IS SUCH A LOVELY DAY BUT HOW SOON DO YOU START AS SOON AS THE LADIES CAN BE READY THE HORSES WILL BE AT THE DOOR IN A VERY FEW MOMENTS
WHAT IS YOUR HAND TIED UP FOR ELSIE ASKED HER GRANDFATHER HAVE YOU BEEN HURT ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED PAINFULLY BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY
THERE ARE A GOOD MANY MORE AND SHE WENT ON OPENING BUNDLE AFTER BUNDLE DISPLAYING THEIR CONTENTS AND TELLING HIM FOR WHOM SHE INTENDED THEM UNTIL AT LAST THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXAMINED AND THEN SHE SAID A LITTLE WEARILY
THAT LAST ASSURANCE I CONSIDER QUITE SUFFICIENT OF ITSELF TO ESTABLISH HER INNOCENCE LORA TURNED AND WENT OUT FEELING VERY HAPPY AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR ELSIE'S PAPA TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS SAYING IN LOVING TENDER TONES MY POOR LITTLE DAUGHTER MY OWN DARLING CHILD
SO SHE MERELY RAISED HER GLAD EYES TO HIS FACE AND ANSWERED I AM VERY WELL THANK YOU PAPA BUT AFTER ALL THIS OCCURRENCE PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN ELSIE'S CONDITION HER FATHER TREATED HER A LITTLE MORE AFFECTIONATELY FOR A DAY OR TWO
HER QUESTIONER FOLLOWED HER WITH AN ADMIRING GLANCE THEN TURNING TO HER FATHER EXCLAIMED WARMLY SHE IS A REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT CHILD DINSMORE ONE THAT ANY FATHER MIGHT BE PROUD OF I WAS ASTONISHED AT HER ANSWERS
DO YOU DO LESSONS IN HOLIDAYS ASKED MARY LESLIE A MERRY FUN LOVING CHILD ABOUT ELSIE'S OWN AGE WHO CONSIDERED LESSONS AN INTOLERABLE BORE AND HAD SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN INVENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TORMENTING CHILDREN
HE ONLY SMILED LIFTED HER UP IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER FONDLY
AND FROM BEGINNING TO END IT GAVE EVIDENCE OF PAINSTAKING CAREFULNESS AND DECIDED IMPROVEMENT AH SURELY THIS WILL PLEASE DEAR PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED HALF ALOUD HOW GOOD AUNT ADELAIDE WAS TO SIT HERE WITH ME
THAT SHE WAS ON HER FATHER'S KNEE AND FELT HIS ARMS FOLDED LOVINGLY ABOUT HER AND HIS KISSES WARM UPON HER CHEEK HER HEART BEAT QUICKLY AS SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING THE FAMILY WERE JUST TAKING THEIR PLACES AT THE TABLE
AND IF IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT YOU SHALL NOT BE PUNISHED BUT IF I FIND YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING ME A FALSEHOOD ELSIE I SHALL PUNISH YOU MUCH MORE SEVERELY THAN IF YOU HAD NOT DENIED YOUR FAULT AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND AS HE SPOKE HE LED HER BACK TO THE SCHOOL ROOM MISS DAY SAID HE SHOWING THE BOOK
AND YOU KNOW I CANNOT TELL A LIE AND IF HE ASKS ME IF IT WAS YOU I CANNOT SAY NO YES I'LL TRUST YOU FOR TELLING TALES REPLIED ARTHUR SNEERINGLY
SO HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AND KEPT THE BOOK UNTIL SHE CAME IN SEARCH OF IT HE LOOKED VERY GUILTY AS THE LITTLE GIRL CAME IN BUT NOT SEEMING TO NOTICE IT SHE MERELY SAID I AM LOOKING FOR MY BOOK I THOUGHT PERHAPS SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT IT IN HERE OH YOU HAVE IT ARTHUR
AND NOW MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE SHOWN SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE SAID WELL ELSIE I THINK YOU HAVE NOW TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR A CHILD OF YOUR AGE THEN PULLING OUT HER WATCH IT IS HIGH TIME FOR LITTLE FOLKS TO BE IN BED ELSIE
BREAKFAST
HE OPENED IT AND STOOPING TO GIVE HER A GOOD MORNING KISS SAID WITH A PLEASED SMILE HOW BRIGHT AND WELL MY DARLING LOOKS HAD YOU A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
BUT TWO BITTER SCALDING TEARS ROLLED QUICKLY DOWN HER BURNING CHEEKS YOU NEEDN'T CRY ELSIE SAID HER FATHER
MY OWN PAPA I'M SO GLAD I DO BELONG TO YOU SHE SAID THROWING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND LAYING HER CHEEK TO HIS FOR AN INSTANT
FOR THOUGH HE WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HE DOES NOT DENY IT AH YES AND NOW I RECOLLECT
MISSUS BROWN THE HOUSEKEEPER TAKING THE HEAD OF THE TABLE FOR THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THEM IN ORDER AND SEEING THAT THEIR WANTS WERE WELL SUPPLIED ELSIE CAME IN TO BREAKFAST FROM A BRISK WALK WITH HER PAPA LOOKING FRESH AND ROSY AND BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
HOW DARED YOU MEDDLE WITH MY WATCH I DIDN'T SIR I NEVER TOUCHED IT HE REPLIED BOLDLY YET AVOIDING HIS FATHER'S EYE AS HE UTTERED THE DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD THERE MY DEAR I TOLD YOU SO EXCLAIMED HIS MOTHER TRIUMPHANTLY
DON'T PUNISH ELSIE FOR I AM CERTAIN SHE IS INNOCENT HE LAID DOWN THE WHIP ASKING HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO BE CONVINCED HE ADDED HIS COUNTENANCE RELAXING SOMEWHAT IN ITS STERN AND ANGRY EXPRESSION
MISSUS DINSMORE AND ADELAIDE APPROACHED THE TREE AND BEGAN THE PLEASANT TASK OF DISTRIBUTING THE GIFTS EVERYTHING WAS LABELLED AND EACH AS HIS OR HER NAME WAS CALLED OUT STEPPED FORWARD TO RECEIVE THE PRESENT NO ONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN EACH HAD SOMETHING
I DON'T DOUBT IT DAUGHTER HE SAID
WHO HAD PUT HER TRUST IN JESUS BUT THEY WERE NOT TO PERISH THUS FOR AT THAT MOMENT A POWERFUL NEGRO
SO HE DECIDED TO RUN THE RISK AND LAYING DOWN THE BOOK HE TOOK THE KEY WENT TO THE DOOR LOOKED CAREFULLY UP AND DOWN THE HALL TO MAKE SURE OF NOT BEING SEEN BY ANY OF THE SERVANTS AND HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF ON THAT POINT HURRIED TO THE SCHOOL ROOM UNLOCKED ELSIE'S DESK TOOK OUT HER COPY BOOK
DO YOU THINK WE ARE IN ANY DANGER OF BEING RUN AWAY WITH ASKED ADELAIDE A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE OBSERVED HIM GLANCING ONCE OR TWICE OUT OF THE WINDOW
VERY WELL THEN I AM QUITE CERTAIN YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FALSEHOOD SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR WORK ELSIE I CAN FORGIVE ANYTHING BUT FALSEHOOD BUT THAT I NEVER WILL FORGIVE COME WITH ME I SHALL TEACH YOU TO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO ME AT LEAST IF TO NO ONE ELSE
WHO HAD BEEN DOWN IN THE GARDEN AND LIBERATED THE HUMMING BIRD HE HAD BEEN AT SUCH PAINS TO CATCH BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF A RARE SPECIES
ASKING VERY KINDLY IF SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER FRIGHT YES PAPA SHE ANSWERED IN A QUIET TONE I KNEW THAT GOD WOULD TAKE CARE OF US OH WASN'T HE GOOD TO KEEP US ALL FROM BEING KILLED YES HE SAID VERY GRAVELY
AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
AS HE TOUCHED HIS HORSES WITH THE WHIP AND DROVE OFF IT WAS GROWING QUITE DARK WHEN THE CARRIAGE AGAIN DROVE UP THE AVENUE AND MISTER HORACE DINSMORE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS CAME OUT TO RECEIVE THEM AND ASK WHAT HAD DETAINED THEM SO LONG
BETTER LIE STILL HONEY TILL DE ROOM GETS WARM I'LL WAIT A LITTLE WHILE MAMMY ELSIE SAID LYING DOWN AGAIN BUT I MUST GET UP SOON FOR I WOULDN'T MISS MY WALK WITH PAPA FOR A GREAT DEAL PLEASE THROW THE SHUTTERS WIDE OPEN AND LET THE DAYLIGHT IN I'M SO GLAD IT HAS COME
SHE SAW THAT IF HE PERMITTED HER TO READ TO HIM FROM GOD'S WORD AS HE SOMETIMES DID IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY PLEASURE IN LISTENING BUT ONLY TO PLEASE HER SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HE EVER PRAYED AND THOUGH HE WENT REGULARLY TO CHURCH
UNLESS SHE HAD HIS EXPRESS PERMISSION TO REMAIN UP LONGER SHE LAY AWAKE FOR SOME TIME THINKING OF HIS UNWONTED KINDNESS AND INDULGING FOND HOPES FOR THE FUTURE THEN FELL ASLEEP TO DREAM
AND SHE YAWNED WEARILY HERE ARE SOME DISSECTED MAPS MARY REPLIED ELSIE OPENING A DRAWER WOULD YOU NOT LIKE THEM NO INDEED THANK YOU THEY ARE TOO MUCH LIKE LESSONS
GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE
HUSH SHE SAID AS WALTER GAVE A SUDDEN SHOUT AT A SUCCESSFUL TOSS ENNA HAD JUST MADE CAN'T YOU BE QUIET
AS TO GROW UP CONCEITED AND VAIN SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH HER OWN SWEET INNOCENT SMILE FREE FROM THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF VANITY NO PAPA SHE SAID I DO NOT MIND WHEN PEOPLE SAY SUCH THINGS BECAUSE I KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS
THEN LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE SHE SAID EARNESTLY BUT FEARFULLY PAPA I DID NOT DO IT WHO DID THEN HE ASKED INDEED PAPA I DO NOT KNOW SHE REPLIED I MUST INQUIRE INTO THIS BUSINESS HE SAID RISING
I WANT EVERY WORD THAT PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND MISS DAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY RECALL IT SEEING THAT HE WAS DETERMINED ELSIE OBEYED HIM THOUGH WITH EVIDENT RELUCTANCE
THOUGH I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN SHE COULD NOT SAVE YOU NOW REPLIED HIS BROTHER AS HE OPENED THE BEDROOM DOOR AND PUSHING HIM IN LOCKED IT UPON HIM AND PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET
ELSIE CHANGE SEATS WITH ME
SHE WAS JUST READY FOR BED WHEN HER PAPA CAME IN AND TAKING HER IN HIS ARMS FOLDED HER TO HIS HEART SAYING MY OWN DARLING MY GOOD OBEDIENT LITTLE DAUGHTER
GO NOW AND LET MAMMY GET YOU READY FOR DINNER AS ELSIE WAS SITTING ALONE IN HER ROOM THAT AFTERNOON
WHEN DEATH SEEMED JUST AT HAND THOSE WORDS AND THE AFFECTIONATE CLASP OF HER FATHER'S ARM SENT A THRILL OF INTENSE JOY TO THE LOVE FAMISHED HEART OF THE LITTLE GIRL BUT DESTRUCTION SEEMED INEVITABLE LORA WAS LEANING BACK HALF FAINTING WITH TERROR
BUT ALAS IT CANNOT BE MY DARLING HE ADDED WITH A SIGH I KNOW THAT PAPA SHE SAID WITH SUDDEN GRAVITY FOR MAN THAT IS BORN OF WOMAN IS OF FEW DAYS AND FULL OF TROUBLE THE BIBLE SAYS

COME HERE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY MEDDLING WITH MY AFFAIRS IN THIS WAY PLEASE PAPA PLEASE DON'T BE SO VERY ANGRY WITH ME
HER FATHER SAW BOTH THE LOOK AND ITS EFFECT AND DRAWING THE LITTLE TREMBLER CLOSER TO HIM HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND STROKING HER HAIR SAID IN A LOW SOOTHING TONE
THIS IS A TURBAN FOR AUNT PHILLIS AND THIS IS A POUND OF TOBACCO FOR OLD UNCLE JACK AND A NICE PIPE TOO LOOK MAMMY WON'T HE BE PLEASED
I HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM SAY THAT IT WAS VERY VALUABLE
TOOK THE KEY OF HER DESK FROM THE MANTEL PIECE WHERE SHE HAD LEFT IT WENT TO THE SCHOOL ROOM AND DID THE MISCHIEF HOPING TO GET HER INTO TROUBLE THEREBY AND THEN RELOCKING THE DESK AND RETURNING THE KEY TO ITS PROPER PLACE THOUGHT YOU HAD ESCAPED DETECTION
ARTHUR KNOWING THIS TO BE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
I WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH YOUR INTELLIGENT ANSWERS TO MISTER LEE LAST EVENING ELSIE SIGHED AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS IT WAS NOT WHAT SHE WANTED WHAT AN ODD CHILD YOU ARE HE SAID LAUGHING
PROCEEDED DELIBERATELY TO BLOT NEARLY EVERY PAGE IN IT ON SOME HE MADE A LARGE BLOT ON OTHERS A SMALL ONE AND ON SOME TWO OR THREE AND ALSO SCRIBBLED BETWEEN THE LINES AND ON THE MARGIN SO AS COMPLETELY TO DEFACE POOR ELSIE'S WORK
EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PACING ANGRILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM ARTHUR
AND IF SO WHAT IT IS ELSIE BLUSHED AND LOOKED DOWN THEN RAISING HER EYES AND SEEING WITH WHAT A TENDER LOVING GLANCE HE WAS REGARDING HER SHE TOOK COURAGE TO SAY YES PAPA THERE IS ONE THING I WOULD HAVE LIKED BETTER
THE HORSES ARE YOUNG AND FIERY BUT AJAX IS AN EXCELLENT DRIVER HE REPLIED EVASIVELY ADDING YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IF I HAD THOUGHT THE DANGER VERY GREAT I WOULD HAVE LEFT ELSIE AT HOME THEY REACHED THE CHURCH WITHOUT ACCIDENT
THE POOR OLD CREATURE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE AND HER FERVENT OUTPOURING OF THANKS AND BLESSINGS ALMOST MADE ELSIE FORGET HER DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE TIME THEN JIM CAME TO THE DOOR ASKING TO SEE MISS ELSIE AND POURED OUT HIS THANKS AMID MANY SOBS AND TEARS
YES PAPA IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO SHE ANSWERED SIMPLY AND THE FATHER SIGHED AS THE THOUGHT AROSE BETTER THAN SHE LOVES ME EVEN AS SHE TOLD ME HERSELF AH I WOULD I COULD BE ALL

I DON'T CARE WHO GETS PUNISHED SO THAT PAPA DOES NOT FIND OUT THAT I DID IT SAID HE FURIOUSLY
YOU YOUNG DOG HE ADDED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED YES I'LL FORGIVE YOU
AND WITH ITS MYRIAD OF LIGHTED TAPERS AND ITS LOAD OF TOYS AND BONBONS INTERSPERSED WITH MANY A RICHER AND MORE COSTLY GIFT MADE QUITE A DISPLAY BEAUTIFUL
AND OH IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE A PAPA TO LOVE ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME AND IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE A DEAR LITTLE DAUGHTER TO LOVE AND TO TAKE CARE OF HE ANSWERED PRESSING HER CLOSER TO HIM
AND SEIZING HIS HAND LOOKED UP EAGERLY INTO HIS FACE EXCLAIMING WITH A BURST OF TEARS AND SOBS O PAPA PAPA DON'T OH DON'T LET THEM WHIP POOR JIM
AND THAT IS YOUR MINIATURE TO HER SURPRISE HE LOOKED HIGHLY PLEASED AT HER REPLY AND GIVING HER ANOTHER KISS SAID WELL DARLING SOME DAY YOU SHALL HAVE IT
FOR IT MUST HAVE BEEN THEN THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE HAD YOU IT WITH YOU WHEN YOU RODE OUT SUDDENLY ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED AND SHE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY
SUCH AS RIDING OUT FOR PLEASURE ON THE SABBATH READING SECULAR NEWSPAPERS AND ENGAGING IN WORLDLY CONVERSATION AND SHE GREATLY FEARED HE DID NOT BUT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HER QUESTION HE ASKED DO YOU ELSIE OH YES SIR
NOW SAID HE BRING THAT STOOL AND SET YOURSELF DOWN HERE CLOSE AT MY KNEE AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN KEEP YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF FOR AN HOUR OR TWO MAY I GET A BOOK TO READ PAPA SHE ASKED TIMIDLY NO SAID HE SHORTLY
BUT I DON'T FEEL FRIGHTENED AT THAT BECAUSE IT TELLS ME BESIDES THAT JESUS LOVES ME
HE SAID SOOTHINGLY ELSIE DEAR YOUR AUNT ADELAIDE THINKS PERHAPS YOU WERE NOT SO VERY MUCH TO BLAME THE OTHER DAY AND NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THOUGH I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND FAULT WITH YOUR TEACHER
AND HER FATHER'S VOICE SAID GOOD MORNING LITTLE DAUGHTER
AND THEN IT IS ALL OVER OH I WISH I COULD BE GOOD I WILL TRY VERY VERY HARD AH IF I MIGHT CLIMB ON HIS KNEE NOW AND LAY MY HEAD ON HIS BREAST AND PUT MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND TELL HIM HOW SORRY I AM THAT I HAVE BEEN NAUGHTY
DID YOU SEE IT TOO WALTER ASKED HIS FATHER YES SIR REPLIED THE LITTLE FELLOW IN A LOW RELUCTANT TONE BUT PLEASE PAPA DON'T PUNISH HIM I'M SURE HE DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK IT HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SHALL BE PUNISHED AS HE DESERVES CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN FURIOUSLY
ARTHUR DID NOT DO IT IT WAS I
AND HE LISTENED TO IT ALL APPARENTLY BOTH PLEASED AND INTERESTED ENCOURAGING HER TO GO ON BY AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION OR A WORD OF ASSENT OR APPROVAL WHAT IS THIS ELSIE HE ASKED TAKING HOLD OF THE CHAIN SHE ALWAYS WORE AROUND HER NECK
SHE HASTILY CROSSED THE ROOM AND SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE SAID ARTHUR YOU HAVE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUSINESS I VERY WELL KNOW NOW CONFESS IT QUICKLY OR HORACE WILL HALF KILL ELSIE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID HE DOGGEDLY
MARVEL NOT THAT I SAID UNTO THEE YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN SHE REPEATED THESE WORDS OF INSPIRATION WITH A DEEP EARNEST SOLEMNITY THAT SEEMED TO IMPRESS EVERY HEARER FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A DEEP HUSH IN THE ROOM THEN THE GENTLEMAN ASKED
PAPA TIED IT UP
BUT ELSIE SPRANG BEHIND THE TREE AND THEN RAN SO FLEETLY TOWARD THE HOUSE THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO OVERTAKE HER UNTIL HIS PASSION HAD HAD TIME TO COOL WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE ARTHUR REPLACED THE WATCH ON HIS FATHER'S TABLE WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN IT
YOUR OLE MAMMY HOPES YOU WILL DARLIN REPLIED CHLOE HEARTILY AN
SAYS THE APOSTLE PAUL I SAY THE TRUTH IN CHRIST I LIE NOT MY CONSCIENCE ALSO BEARING ME WITNESS IN THE HOLY GHOST THAT I HAVE GREAT HEAVINESS AND CONTINUAL SORROW IN MY HEART
ELSIE WONDERED WHY ARTHUR DID NOT GO TO SEE AFTER HIS BIRD BUT SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT IN THE INTEREST WITH WHICH SHE WAS PORING OVER THE STORY OF THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON THE JACK STONE PLAYERS WERE JUST FINISHING THEIR GAME
I'LL PAY YOU FOR IT I SHALL SAY NOTHING UNLESS IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SAVE THE INNOCENT OR I AM FORCED TO SPEAK BUT IN THAT CASE I SHALL TELL THE TRUTH REPLIED ELSIE FIRMLY ARTHUR DOUBLED UP HIS FIST AND MADE A PLUNGE AT HER AS IF HE MEANT TO KNOCK HER DOWN
BUT TO DO ARTHUR JUSTICE THOUGH HE KNEW HIS BROTHER WOULD BE PRETTY SURE TO BE VERY ANGRY WITH ELSIE HE DID NOT KNOW OF THE THREATENED PUNISHMENT HE STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE AS HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A FOOTSTEP AND SHUT DOWN THE LID UNTIL IT HAD PASSED WHEN HE RAISED IT AGAIN AND WENT ON WITH HIS WICKED WORK
STUDYING AND RECITING TO HIM THEN THEY TOOK A LONG RIDE ON HORSEBACK AND WHEN THEY RETURNED SHE FOUND THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AMONG THEM WAS CAROLINE HOWARD A FAVORITE FRIEND OF ELSIE'S
NO SAID HER BROTHER THAT IS A VERY BAD PLAN AND ONE WHICH I SHALL NEVER ADOPT ELSIE WILL LEARN IN TIME IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT NOW THAT I NEVER UTTER A THREAT WHICH I DO NOT INTEND TO CARRY OUT AND NEVER BREAK MY WORD HE HAD DRAWN A HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET WHILE SPEAKING
FOLLOWED HER TO THE WINDOW NEVER MIND DEAR SHE SAID IN HER PLEASANT CHEERY TONE PATTING ELSIE'S CHEEK AND SMOOTHING HER HAIR I'VE GOT SOME EXCELLENT GLUE AND I THINK I CAN STICK IT ON AGAIN AND MAKE IT ALMOST AS GOOD AS EVER
THE SAME EXPRESSION COMPLEXION
AT FIRST ARTHUR SEEMED DISPOSED TO RESIST BUT SOON SEEING HOW USELESS IT WAS TO CONTEND AGAINST SUCH ODDS HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE SAYING SULLENLY YOU WOULDN'T TREAT ME THIS WAY IF MAMMA WAS AT HOME SHE IS NOT HOWEVER AS IT HAPPENS
WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED TURNING PALE WITH TERROR WHAT SAID HE DO YOU ASK ME WHAT DID I NOT TELL YOU POSITIVELY THAT I WOULD PUNISH YOU IF YOUR COPY BOOK THIS MONTH DID NOT PRESENT A BETTER APPEARANCE THAN IT DID LAST O PAPA DOES IT NOT
PAPA KNEW BEST AFTER ALL DID HE NOT ASKED HER FATHER DRAWING HER TO HIM AND PATTING HER CHEEK YES PAPA SHE SAID SOFTLY YOU ALWAYS KNOW BEST AND I AM VERY SORRY I WAS NAUGHTY HE ANSWERED WITH A KISS AND TAKING HER HAND LED HER DOWN TO THE DRAWING ROOM
WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAD OFFENDED AND KNEW SHE WAS IN DISGRACE BUT PUTTING ONE OF HER LITTLE HANDS IN HIS SHE LOOKED UP PLEADINGLY INTO HIS FACE ASKING IN A SLIGHTLY TREMULOUS TONE DEAR PAPA ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME
AND THE RELIEF WAS SO GREAT THAT FOR ONCE SHE SCARCELY HEEDED HER FATHER'S REBUKE ANOTHER HALF HOUR PASSED AND MISTER DINSMORE STILL SAT READING TAKING NO NOTICE OF ELSIE WHO AFRAID TO SPEAK OR MOVE WAS GROWING VERY WEARY AND SLEEPY
IT WAS BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT PROPER AND RESPECTABLE TO DO SO AND NOT THAT HE CARED TO WORSHIP GOD OR TO LEARN HIS WILL THIS CONVICTION WHICH HAD GRADUALLY DAWNED UPON ELSIE UNTIL NOW IT AMOUNTED TO CERTAINTY CAUSED HER GREAT GRIEF
EXCEPTING WHERE HIS OWN WERE CONCERNED ELSIE HE KNEW WAS OUT AND CHLOE IN THE KITCHEN SO FEELING CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO INTERFERE WITH HIM HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM TO LOOK FOR THE BOOK HE SOON FOUND IT LYING ON THE MANTEL BUT THE DESK KEY LAY RIGHT BESIDE IT
VERY TRYING TO THE PATIENCE OF THEIR ATTENDANTS O ELSIE EXCLAIMED CARRY HOWARD
SHE FOUND HER FATHER IN HIS ROOM HE TOOK THE REPORT FIRST FROM HER HAND AND GLANCING OVER IT SAID WITH A SLIGHT FROWN I SEE YOU HAVE ONE VERY BAD MARK FOR RECITATION BUT AS THERE IS ONLY ONE AND THE OTHERS ARE REMARKABLY GOOD I WILL EXCUSE IT
BUT I THINK I WILL REMEMBER NOT TO DO IT AGAIN
AS HE TURNED HIS FLASHING EYE UPON HER
IT IS ALWAYS NEW AND I DO LOVE IT SO IT IS SO VERY SWEET MAY I READ A LITTLE TO YOU SHE ADDED COAXINGLY YES I LOVE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING READ BY MY DARLING HE SAID SITTING DOWN AND TAKING HER ON HIS KNEE
CARRY HOWARD AND A GOOD MANY OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS ARE COMING YOU KNOW
WAS ALREADY UPON THE TABLE WHEN THEY RETURNED AND THEY BROUGHT TO IT APPETITES SUFFICIENTLY KEEN TO MAKE IT VERY ENJOYABLE ELSIE SPENT THE FIRST HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST AT THE PIANO PRACTISING AND THE SECOND IN HER PAPA'S DRESSING ROOM
AND WILL NEVER LEAVE NOR FORSAKE ME AND THAT HE HAS ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH AND WILL NEVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO ME BUT WHAT SHALL DO ME GOOD
SHE AND LUCY HAD NOT SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE THE WEEK THE LATTER HAD SPENT AT ROSELANDS EARLY IN THE SUMMER AND BOTH FELT PLEASED TO MEET MISSUS CARRINGTON GAVE ELSIE A WARM EMBRACE REMARKING THAT SHE HAD GROWN AND WAS LOOKING EXTREMELY WELL BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN HER
SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD NOT GO WITHOUT SOME LITTLE TOKEN OF FORGIVENESS AND LOVE SOME SLIGHT CARESS HE LOOKED AT HER WITH AN IMPATIENT WELL THEN IN ANSWER TO HER MUTE REQUEST
AND TAKING HER HAND AGAIN HE LED OR RATHER DRAGGED HER FROM THE ROOM FOR HE WAS TERRIBLY ANGRY HIS FACE FAIRLY PALE WITH PASSION LORA CAME IN WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING AND CERTAIN THAT ELSIE WOULD NEVER BE CAUGHT IN A FALSEHOOD HER EYE QUICKLY SOUGHT ARTHUR'S DESK
IF YOU PLEASE ADELAIDE SAID HE HAUGHTILY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ALLOWED TO MANAGE MY OWN CHILD AS I SEE PROPER WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM OTHERS
HERE BILL TO A SERVANT CARRY THESE BUNDLES TO MISS ELSIE'S ROOM THEN PICKING HER UP HE TOSSED HER OVER HIS SHOULDER AND CARRIED HER UP STAIRS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A BABY SHE CLINGING TO HIM AND LAUGHING MERRILY
OR IF HE IS TOO BUSY TO GO HIMSELF TO LET POMP OR AJAX DRIVE US IN I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FUN TO GO ALONE ELSIE DON'T YOU ASKED CAROLINE WITH SOME HESITATION ADDING QUICKLY
THE YOUNG PARTY AT ROSELANDS HAD NOW GROWN SO LARGE SEVERAL ADDITIONS HAVING BEEN MADE TO IT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THAT A SEPARATE TABLE WAS ORDERED TO BE SPREAD FOR THEM IN THE NURSERY WHERE THEY TOOK THEIR MEALS TOGETHER
DEAR PAPA AM I LIKE MAMMA ASKED ELSIE WHO HAD CAUGHT A PART OF HIS WORDS YES DARLING VERY MUCH INDEED AND I HOPE YOU WILL GROW MORE SO YOU LOVED MAMMA SHE SAID INQUIRINGLY DEARLY VERY DEARLY
ASKED THE TIMID LITTLE VOICE AS THEY ROSE FROM THE TABLE NO HE SAID TAKING HER HAND AND LEADING HER OUT TO THE VERANDA WHERE HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN AN EASY CHAIR AND LIGHTED A CIGAR BRING ME THAT BOOK THAT LIES YONDER ON THE SETTEE HE COMMANDED SHE BROUGHT IT
IT IS TRUE WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING GOOD OF OURSELVES WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WE CAN DO NOTHING RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE SO VERY WICKED BUT THEN WE CAN ALWAYS GET THAT HELP IF WE ASK FOR IT JESUS SAID
WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT DOES ELSIE WANT ASKED ADELAIDE WHO WAS STANDING NEAR AND HAD OVERHEARD ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE TROUBLE MISTER DINSMORE EXPLAINED
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE ASKED LOOKING KEENLY INTO HER FACE JUST AS I KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU PAPA OR ANY ONE ELSE SHE REPLIED LIFTING HER EYES TO HIS FACE IN EVIDENT SURPRISE AT THE STRANGENESS OF THE QUESTION
THEN AN EARNEST IMPORTUNATE PRAYER FOR HELP TO DO RIGHT AND WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO GAIN HER FATHER'S LOVE WENT UP FROM THE ALMOST DESPAIRING LITTLE HEART TO HIM WHOSE EAR IS EVER OPEN UNTO THE CRY OF HIS SUFFERING CHILDREN
MY KINSMEN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BRETHREN MY HEART'S DESIRE AND PRAYER TO GOD FOR ISRAEL IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND SUCH DEAR READER IS IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE THE FEELING OF EVERY RENEWED HEART
I WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME AND THUS IT WAS WITH ELSIE SHE KNEW NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO REAL LOVE FOR JESUS NONE OF THE TRUE FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES
AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HER ON HIS KNEE WHEN VISITORS WERE ANNOUNCED AND CHANGING HIS MIND HE DISMISSED HER TO HER ROOM AND SHE SAW NO MORE OF HIM THAT EVENING OH IF THEY ONLY HADN'T COME JUST NOW THOUGHT THE SORELY DISAPPOINTED CHILD
SHE LONGED TO LAY HER HEAD ON HER FATHER'S KNEE BUT DARED NOT VENTURE TO TAKE SUCH A LIBERTY BUT AT LENGTH SHE WAS SO COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED BY SLEEP AS TO DO SO UNCONSCIOUSLY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE PRONOUNCING HER NAME AROUSED HER
THEN HURRIED ON TO HER ROOM WHERE SHE SEATED HERSELF IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND LAYING HER ARMS UPON THE SILL RESTED HER HEAD UPON THEM AND WHILE THE BITTER TEARS FELL FAST FROM HER EYES SHE MURMURED HALF ALOUD
AND NOW I'M ALL READY FOR OUR WALK IN GOOD SEASON TOO HE SAID
I SHALL TIE THIS HAND UP ELSIE HE SAID PROCEEDING TO DO SO THOSE WHO DO NOT USE THEIR HANDS ARIGHT MUST BE DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF THEM THERE LET ME SEE IF THAT WILL KEEP IT OUT OF MISCHIEF I SHALL TIE YOU UP HAND AND FOOT BEFORE LONG IF YOU CONTINUE SUCH MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS
BUT TAKE OFF YOUR HAT AND COME AND SIT ON MY KNEE A LITTLE WHILE FIRST BREAKFAST WILL BE LATE THIS MORNING AND WE NEED NOT HURRY DID YOU GET SOMETHING TO EAT HE ASKED AS HE SEATED HIMSELF BY THE FIRE AND DREW HER TO HIS SIDE
I PRESUME IT WAS YOU SIR HE SAID VERY ANGRILY AND IF SO YOU MAY PREPARE YOURSELF FOR EITHER A FLOGGING OR A RETURN TO YOUR PRISON FOR ONE OR THE OTHER I AM DETERMINED YOU SHALL HAVE I DIDN'T DO IT ANY SUCH THING REPLIED THE BOY FIERCELY
AND ATTENDED TO THE OUTWARD OBSERVANCES OF RELIGION WERE QUITE SAFE HE COULD SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A CHANGE OF HEART HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY NOT HE NO INDEED HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
AND THE TEARS FELL FASTER AND FASTER INDEED SAID HE YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO MEDDLE WITH IT LET WHO WOULD HAVE PUT IT THERE WHICH HAND DID IT THIS ONE PAPA SOBBED THE CHILD INDICATING HER RIGHT HAND HE TOOK IT IN HIS AND HELD IT A MOMENT
YET THE LITTLE GIRL'S SITUATION WAS FAR FROM COMFORTABLE AND HER PATIENCE OFTEN SEVERELY TRIED FOR MISSUS DINSMORE WAS EXCESSIVELY ANGRY WITH HER ON ARTHUR'S ACCOUNT AND WHENEVER HER FATHER WAS NOT PRESENT TREATED HER IN THE MOST UNKIND MANNER AND FROM THE SAME CAUSE THE REST OF THE FAMILY
SHE HELD UP HER FACE FOR A KISS WHICH HE GAVE I WISH I COULD ALWAYS BE GOOD PAPA SHE SAID BUT I AM NAUGHTY SO OFTEN NO SAID HE I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
MISTER DINSMORE LINGERED A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO THE MAN WHO HAD DONE THEM SUCH GOOD SERVICE AND TO GIVE SOME DIRECTIONS TO THE COACHMAN AND THEN TAKING THE HAND OF HIS LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM HE WALKED SLOWLY ON
DEAR DEAR PAPA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW HOW I LONG TO SIT THERE BUT MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD HASTILY RETIRED ON THE EXIT OF ARTHUR AND HIS FATHER FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOW SAILING MAJESTICALLY DOWN THE HALL ON HER RETURN THITHER
WHO WAS SOBBING AND WIPING HER EYES WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON ENNA TOOK MY BLOCKS SOBBED THE CHILD
ARTHUR WAS ALREADY IN THE DINING ROOM WHEN MISTER DINSMORE CAME DOWN
HE ADDED HOLDING UP THE INJURED ARTICLE MY DEAR HOW CAN YOU SAY SO HAVE YOU ANY PROOF ASKED HIS WIFE DEPRECATINGLY
FAVOR IS DECEITFUL AND BEAUTY IS VAIN AND IN ANOTHER PLACE HE THAT FLATTERETH HIS NEIGHBOR SPREADETH A NET FOR HIS FEET SO I WILL TRY TO KEEP AWAY FROM THAT LADY SHALL I NOT PAPA WHENEVER YOU CAN DO SO WITHOUT RUDENESS DAUGHTER
SAYING TO THE ELDER MISTER DINSMORE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO ION AND WOULD PROBABLY NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT THEN WITH A SIGH THE LITTLE GIRL WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM TO PREPARE HER MORNING LESSONS
BUT HERE COME THE BUNDLES WHAT A NUMBER NO WONDER YOU WERE LATE IN GETTING HOME
HOW PRETTY YOUR HAIR IS ELSIE SAID CAROLINE WINDING THE GLOSSY RINGLETS AROUND HER FINGER I WISH YOU'D GIVE ME ONE OF THESE CURLS I WANT TO GET A BRACELET MADE FOR MAMMA AND SHE THINKS SO MUCH OF YOU AND YOUR HAIR IS SUCH A LOVELY COLOR
AND SEATING HERSELF BEFORE THE DESK TOOK OUT HER PEN AND INK CHLOE PUT THE HAT AND PELISSE CAREFULLY AWAY BROUGHT A COMB AND BRUSH AND SMOOTHED HER NURSLING'S HAIR AND THEN BEGAN HER SHARE OF THE BUSINESS ON HAND
STILL YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION HE SAID WITH A SMILE AS HE SAT DOWN AND DREW HER TO HIS SIDE ADDING IN A PLAYFUL TONE COME I AM NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH ANY EVASION TELL ME TRULY IF YOU WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SOMETHING ELSE
ELSIE I THINK YOU WOULD BE DOING VERY WICKEDLY TO ALLOW AN INNOCENT PERSON TO SUFFER WHEN YOU CAN PREVENT IT AND BESIDES I WILL ADD THE WEIGHT OF MY AUTHORITY AND SAY YOU MUST DO IT AT ONCE
MISTER DINSMORE TO ELSIE'S PAPA WHO JUST THEN CAME TOWARD THEM YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY PROUD OF THIS CHILD SHE IS THE VERY IMAGE OF YOURSELF AND A PERFECT LITTLE BEAUTY TOO
HE WAS CONVERSING WITH A STRANGE GENTLEMAN AND HIS LITTLE GIRL STOOD QUIETLY AT HIS SIDE PATIENTLY WAITING UNTIL HE SHOULD BE READY TO GIVE HER HIS ATTENTION SHE HAD TO WAIT SOME MOMENTS FOR THE GENTLEMEN WERE DISCUSSING SOME POLITICAL QUESTION
NO DAUGHTER I AM SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU BUT I AM AFRAID YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO BE TRUSTED ON SUCH AN EXPEDITION WITH ONLY A SERVANT YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN TAKE YOU MYSELF BUT PAPA WE WANT TO GO TO DAY
WITH SEVEN LEAGUED BOOTS OCCUPY IN THE ORDINARY NURSERY TALES AND HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE WAS IT NOT THE BLACK DOUGLAS WHO SLEW WITH HIS OWN HAND THE HEIR OF THE OSBALDISTONE FAMILY THE DAY AFTER HE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ESTATE SURPRISING HIM
WITH LONG WORDS AND HARD NAMES AND READING ALOUD FOR THE PURPOSE OF HIS OWN EDIFICATION A VOLUME OF CONTROVERSIAL DIVINITY I WAS JUST TAKING A SPELL SAID HE LAYING ASIDE THE HUGE FOLIO VOLUME AS I ENTERED
AS FAST AS FAST MIGHT BE
WITH A VIEW TO POSSESS HIM OF RASHLEIGH'S REAL CHARACTER ALTHOUGH FROM THE COURSE OF POST IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED IT YET I HAD SENT IT BY THE USUAL CONVEYANCE FROM THE HALL
I TELL YOU ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS THE ROAD I MUST TRAVEL I WILL PAY THE FELLOW TO HIS SATISFACTION I WILL GIVE HIM ANYTHING IN REASON
THE ABODE OF MY FATHERS WHICH I WAS NOW APPROACHING WAS SITUATED IN A GLEN OR NARROW VALLEY WHICH RAN UP AMONG THOSE HILLS EXTENSIVE ESTATES WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO THE FAMILY OF OSBALDISTONE HAD BEEN LONG DISSIPATED BY THE MISFORTUNES
THERE WAS IN THE DAYS OF WHICH I WRITE AN OLD FASHIONED CUSTOM ON THE ENGLISH ROAD WHICH I SUSPECT IS NOW OBSOLETE OR PRACTISED ONLY BY THE VULGAR JOURNEYS OF LENGTH BEING MADE ON HORSEBACK AND OF COURSE BY BRIEF STAGES
YOU LEAVE YOUR SERVICE THEN BUT WILL YOU NOT LOSE YOUR WAGES
AND IN THE STORES WITH WHICH A TOLERABLE EDUCATION HAD POSSESSED MY MIND IN THE LATTER RESPECT HE OFFERED NO COMPETITION AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HIS NATURAL POWERS HAD NEVER BEEN CULTIVATED BY EDUCATION
HE HAD THE HARD FEATURES AND ATHLETIC FORM SAID TO BE PECULIAR TO HIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL INTONATION AND SLOW PEDANTIC MODE OF EXPRESSION ARISING FROM A DESIRE TO AVOID PECULIARITIES OF IDIOM OR DIALECT
THEN I FEAR YOU ARE EQUALLY A STRANGER TO THE MORE MODERN NAMES OF GIBSON AND BARTLETT I AM INDEED MISS VERNON AND DO YOU NOT BLUSH TO OWN IT SAID MISS VERNON WHY WE MUST FORSWEAR YOUR ALLIANCE
HIS TREMORS CEASED TO AMUSE ME AND TO SAY THE TRUTH
HE WISHED NO DOUBT THAT I SHOULD REMAIN IN SUCH IGNORANCE OF MY RELATIVES AND DESCENT AS MIGHT INSURE A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MY FEELINGS AND HIS OWN ON THIS SUBJECT BUT HIS DESIGNS AS WILL HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY TO THE WISEST
AND I WAS DISTRESSED BY THE NEWS OF MISTER TRESHAM YET LESS SO THAN IF THEY HAD FULLY OCCUPIED MY MIND I WAS NEITHER A FALSE LOVER NOR AN UNFEELING SON
AND USUALLY SKILFUL IN THE MODE OF OBTAINING IT FATHER VAUGHAN WAS A PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCE OF RASHLEIGH'S OTHERWISE IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS FOOTING AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
COMMUNICATING WITH THE LIBRARY BY A PRIVATE ENTRANCE AND BY ANOTHER INTRICATE AND DARK VAULTED PASSAGE WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
IT LIKEWISE ALLUDED TO SEVERAL LETTERS WHICH AS IT APPEARED TO ME MUST HAVE MISCARRIED OR HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED AND COMPLAINED OF MY OBDURATE SILENCE IN TERMS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNJUST HAD MY LETTERS REACHED THEIR PURPOSED DESTINATION
AN OFFICE WHICH WOULD SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR HER OBVIOUS EMOTION AT HIS APPEARANCE AS TO THE REST THEY DID NOT SEEM TO CONVERSE MUCH TOGETHER OR EVEN TO SEEK EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY THEIR LEAGUE IF ANY SUBSISTED BETWEEN THEM
HE REPLIED HASTILY THAT HE SEEMS A THOUGHT RASH IN CONFERRING THE HONOUR OF HIS COMPANY ON THOSE WHO DESIRE IT NOT THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED I KNOWS HIS OWN AFFAIRS BEST AND I SHOULD BE SORRY TO CONSTITUTE MYSELF A JUDGE OF THEM IN ANY RESPECT
AS IF TO HER ASSISTANCE THERE WAS HOWEVER NO CAUSE FOR ALARM IT WAS NOT A STUMBLE NOR A FALSE STEP AND IF IT HAD THE FAIR AMAZON HAD TOO MUCH SELF POSSESSION TO HAVE BEEN DERANGED BY IT SHE THANKED MY GOOD INTENTIONS HOWEVER BY A SMILE
FIRST MADE HIS APPEARANCE FROM THE COPSE WHICH CLOTHED THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE VALLEY HIS DROOPING BRUSH HIS SOILED APPEARANCE AND JADED TROT PROCLAIMED HIS FATE IMPENDING
CAUSTIC AND SOMEWHAT SATIRICAL REMARKS WERE THOSE OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN A CLOSE OBSERVER OF THE AFFAIRS OF THAT COUNTRY ON THE SUBJECT OF POLITICS
I WAS AMAZED AS I READ THAT THE SPIRIT OF RASHLEIGH WALKED AROUND ME AND CONJURED UP THESE DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES BY WHICH I WAS SURROUNDED I COULD NOT DOUBT FOR ONE INSTANT
ANSWERED MY COMPANION AND THEN TURNING TO ME HE GAVE VENT TO THE TENOR OF HIS OWN REFLECTIONS I RESPECT THE SCOTCH SIR I LOVE AND HONOUR THE NATION FOR THEIR SENSE OF MORALITY MEN TALK OF THEIR FILTH AND THEIR POVERTY
THIS PIECE OF GRATUITOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ROUTE HE PROPOSED TO HIMSELF THE FIRST I HAD HEARD MY COMPANION BESTOW UPON ANY ONE FAILED TO EXCITE THE CORRESPONDING CONFIDENCE OF THE SCOTCHMAN WE CAN SCARCE TRAVEL TOGETHER HE REPLIED DRILY
AND NOTE THE CONTENTS SHALL DO MISTER R O SUCH CIVILITIES AS ARE IN MY POWER AND HAVE TAKEN HIM TO SEE THE BANK AND CUSTOM HOUSE HE SEEMS A SOBER STEADY YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND TAKES TO BUSINESS
YOU ANDREW HOW WILL YOU GET AWAY FROM YOUR EMPLOYMENT I TELL'D YOUR HONOUR A WHILE SYNE THAT IT WAS LANG THAT I HAE BEEN THINKING O FLITTING MAYBE AS LANG AS FRAE THE FIRST YEAR I CAME TO OSBALDISTONE HALL
TO SUCH CLOSE CONFIDENCE THESE QUESTIONS AND DIFFICULTIES PRESSED ON MY MIND WITH AN INTEREST WHICH WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RESOLVING THEM
SAVOURED OF PRIESTCRAFT THE NATIVES SUCH THEY MIGHT BE WELL TERMED OF OSBALDISTONE HALL LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH MUCH MORE FEAR OR AT LEAST MORE AWE THAN AFFECTION HIS CONDEMNATION OF THEIR REVELS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR BEING DISCONTINUED IN SOME MEASURE
SUCH WERE MY REFLECTIONS WHEN I GAINED MY APARTMENT IT SEEMS FROM THE ILLUSTRATION THEY ALREADY BEGAN TO HAVE A TWANG OF COMMERCE IN THEM I SET MYSELF SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER YOUR FATHER'S LETTER IT WAS NOT VERY DISTINCT
THAT THE LADY MIGHT EASILY APPROPRIATE THE GREATER SHARE OF IT FOR THORNCLIFF SEEMED AN ARRANT COUNTRY BUMPKIN AWKWARD SHY AND SOMEWHAT SULKY WITHAL HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME HOWEVER
COULD LEAVE THE HALL OR RETURN TO IT AT PLEASURE
I DO NOT EVEN REMEMBER THE AUTHOR'S NAME O LUD ON WHAT A STRAND ARE YOU WRECKED REPLIED THE YOUNG LADY A POOR FORLORN AND IGNORANT STRANGER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE VERY ALCORAN OF THE SAVAGE TRIBE WHOM YOU ARE COME TO RESIDE AMONG NEVER TO HAVE HEARD OF MARKHAM
OR MISCONDUCT OF MY ANCESTORS BUT ENOUGH WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE OLD MANSION TO GIVE MY UNCLE THE TITLE OF A MAN OF LARGE PROPERTY THIS HE EMPLOYED AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND BY SOME INQUIRIES WHICH I MADE ON THE ROAD
BUT WHAT ON EARTH BRINGS YOU TO CUB CASTLE FOR SO THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE CHRISTENED THIS HUNTING HALL OF OURS YOU MIGHT HAVE STAYED AWAY I SUPPOSE IF YOU WOULD
AT LEAST ONE OF THE FIRST MERCHANTS ON CHANGE AND TO HAVE PROVED HIM THE LINEAL REPRESENTATIVE OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WOULD HAVE FAR LESS FLATTERED HIS VANITY THAN THE HUM AND BUSTLE
TO TAKE A PART OF HIS FAMILY BEEF AND PUDDING THIS INVITATION
LEAST HE DISNA TAKE ME UP WHEN I TELL HIM THE LEARNED NAMES O THE PLANTS OF FATHER VAUGHAN WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME AND HIS GHOSTLY CARE BETWEEN OSBALDISTONE HALL AND ABOUT HALF A DOZEN MANSIONS OF CATHOLIC GENTLEMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
THE DOGS PURSUED THE TRACE OF REYNARD WITH UNERRING INSTINCT AND THE HUNTERS FOLLOWED WITH RECKLESS HASTE REGARDLESS OF THE BROKEN AND DIFFICULT NATURE OF THE GROUND THEY WERE TALL STOUT YOUNG MEN WELL MOUNTED
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NONE SUCH IN SCOTLAND NA NA ANSWERED ANDREW BOLDLY THEN SHADED AWAY HIS NEGATIVE WITH UNLESS IT BE ON FASTERN'S E'EN OR THE LIKE O THAT
THAT THERE WAS A SCOTCH GENTLEMAN TO DINE WITH US A GENTLEMAN WHAT SORT OF A GENTLEMAN SAID MY COMPANION SOMEWHAT HASTILY HIS MIND I SUPPOSE RUNNING ON GENTLEMEN OF THE PAD AS THEY WERE THEN TERMED
ALL THESE LIKE BENEDICK'S BRUSHING HIS HAT OF A MORNING WERE SIGNS THAT THE SWEET YOUTH WAS IN LOVE AND WHILE MY JUDGMENT STILL DENIED THAT I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF FORMING AN ATTACHMENT SO IMPRUDENT
AND I FELT ENCOURAGED TO PUT MY HORSE TO THE SAME PACE AND TO KEEP IN HER IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE CLAMOUR OF WHOOP DEAD DEAD AND THE CORRESPONDING FLOURISH OF THE FRENCH HORN SOON ANNOUNCED TO US THAT THERE WAS NO MORE OCCASION FOR HASTE SINCE THE CHASE
WAS MY QUESTION NO JUST THAT OFTEN NEITHER BUT I HAE NOTICED IT ANCE OR TWICE
PARTICULAR BUSINESS REPLIED I
A VISION THAT PASSED ME INTERRUPTED THESE REFLECTIONS IT WAS A YOUNG LADY THE LOVELINESS OF WHOSE VERY STRIKING FEATURES WAS ENHANCED BY THE ANIMATION OF THE CHASE AND THE GLOW OF THE EXERCISE
THIS GAVE ME NO DESIRE TO CULTIVATE HIS INTIMACY NOR DID HE SEEM TO MAKE ANY ADVANCES TOWARDS MINE SO OUR OCCASIONAL INTERCOURSE WAS CONFINED TO THE EXCHANGE OF MERE CIVILITY I CONSIDERED IT AS EXTREMELY PROBABLE
AND THE RESULT OF MY DELIBERATION WAS A FIRM RESOLUTION TO DEPART FROM OSBALDISTONE HALL THE NEXT DAY AND WEND MY WAY WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO MEET OWEN AT GLASGOW I DID NOT HOLD IT EXPEDIENT TO INTIMATE MY DEPARTURE TO MY UNCLE
MISTER CAMPBELL MADE NO FARTHER OBSERVATION BUT MERELY WISHED ME A GOOD JOURNEY AND THE PARTY DISPERSED FOR THE EVENING NEXT DAY I PARTED COMPANY WITH MY TIMID COMPANION
STAUNCHLY SUPPORTED THE CAUSE OF KING GEORGE AND THE PROTESTANT SUCCESSION DIRE WAS THE SCREAMING DEEP THE OATHS EACH PARTY APPEALED TO MISTER CAMPBELL ANXIOUS IT SEEMED TO ELICIT HIS APPROBATION YOU ARE A SCOTCHMAN SIR
CERTAINLY IF I COULD MEET WITH ANY PERSON GOING THAT WAY AND YOUR HONOUR DOUBTLESS WAD CONSIDER THE TIME AND TROUBLE UNQUESTIONABLY MY BUSINESS IS PRESSING AND IF YOU CAN FIND ANY GUIDE TO ACCOMPANY ME
I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT MY FRIENDSHIP FOR DIANA VERNON WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SO DISINTERESTED AS IN WISDOM IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
SHE POURED HERSELF FORTH TO MY INFANT EAR IN DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SCENES OF HER YOUTH
REPLIED ANDREW VERY BRISKLY AND IF I MIGHT ADVISE WE WAD BE AFF TWA HOURS EARLIER
AND WHEN HE GETS HIS HAND IN PLAY HE MAY IF HE BE SO MINDED MAKE THIS REVEREND GENTLEMAN ARCHPRELATE OF CANTERBURY AND DOCTOR MIXIT CHIEF PHYSICIAN TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND COMMIT HIS ROYAL BEARD TO THE CARE OF MY FRIEND LATHERUM
HOPE YOU WILL ADVISE THE ABOVE COMING SAFE TO HAND AM SORRY WE HAVE SO FEW OF YOURS YOUR FATHER SAYS HE IS AS USUAL BUT LOOKS POORLY FROM THIS EPISTLE WRITTEN IN OLD OWEN'S FORMAL STYLE
HOOPER AND GIRDER OF NEWCASTLE
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD HEARD THE SCOTTISH ACCENT OR INDEED THAT I HAD FAMILIARLY MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE ANCIENT NATION BY WHOM IT WAS SPOKEN YET FROM AN EARLY PERIOD THEY HAD OCCUPIED AND INTERESTED MY IMAGINATION
STAY I KEN JUST THE BEAST THAT WILL ANSWER ME AT FIVE IN THE MORNING THEN ANDREW YOU WILL MEET ME AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE DEIL A FEAR O ME
AND CONFER ON OUR FRIEND MISTER QUITAM THE PREFERMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL AND HE MAY ALSO GRANT SOME GOOD DEED OR REWARD TO THIS HONEST GENTLEMAN WHO IS SITTING UPON HIS PORTMANTEAU WHICH HE PREFERS TO A CHAIR AND QUESTIONLESS
WERE IT BUT TO EXPRESS HIS ADVICE AND COMMANDS IN AN AFFAIR OF SOME DIFFICULTY AND WHERE MY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED ADEQUATE TO MY OWN GUIDANCE
AND I HAVE NO TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT ANDREW DO YOU MAKE THE BARGAIN FOR ME YOUR OWN WAY AHA THAT'S SPEAKING TO THE PURPOSE ANSWERED ANDREW I AM THINKING SINCE SAE BE THAT SAE IT IS I'LL BE THE LAD THAT WILL GUIDE YOU MYSELL
AND I EXPRESSED MYSELF TO THIS PURPOSE TO MISTER OWEN A SHOPKEEPER IN A LITTLE TOWN TO WHOM THE POST MASTER DIRECTED ME READILY GAVE ME IN GOLD THE AMOUNT OF MY BILL ON MESSRS HOOPER AND GIRDER
MINE HOST AND HIS SUNDAY GUESTS AFTER AN EFFORT OR TWO TO SUPPORT THEIR CONSEQUENCE BY NOISE AND BOLD AVERMENT SUNK GRADUALLY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF MISTER CAMPBELL WHO THUS FAIRLY POSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE LEAD IN THE CONVERSATION
FLAY'D BY A GHOST ANDREW
SEEMED TO INVITE THE TRAVELLER TO EXPLORE THEIR RECESSES THE CHEVIOTS ROSE BEFORE ME IN FROWNING MAJESTY NOT INDEED WITH THE SUBLIME VARIETY OF ROCK AND CLIFF WHICH CHARACTERIZES MOUNTAINS OF THE PRIMARY CLASS
AND TRICKY IN THE BUSINESS OF PEACEFUL LIFE AND HAVING FEW GOOD QUALITIES UNLESS THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED SUCH A FEROCITY WHICH RESEMBLED COURAGE IN MARTIAL AFFAIRS AND A SORT OF WILY CRAFT WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF WISDOM IN THE ORDINARY COMMERCE OF MANKIND
FOLLOWING HIM WITH EYES IN WHICH DISDAIN WAS ADMIRABLY PAINTED THE PRINCE OF GROOMS AND COCK FIGHTERS AND BLACKGUARD HORSE COURSERS BUT THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM TO MEND ANOTHER HAVE YOU READ MARKHAM SAID MISS VERNON READ WHOM MA'AM
ANDREW HAD INDEED NEITHER WIFE CHILD NOR FEMALE INMATE IN HIS FAMILY THE FIRST OF HIS TRADE HE SAID HAD HAD ENEUGH O'THAE CATTLE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING HE SOMETIMES CONTRIVED TO FORM AN AUDIENCE FOR HIMSELF
AND THE CARRION CROW WHICH HOVERED OVER HIM ALREADY CONSIDERED POOR REYNARD AS SOON TO BE HIS PREY HE CROSSED THE STREAM WHICH DIVIDES THE LITTLE VALLEY AND WAS DRAGGING HIMSELF UP A RAVINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ITS WILD BANKS
AND FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHIGS THEN IN POWER HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A HEARING FOR MY CAUSE SO UPON THE WHOLE I JUDGED IT MOST SAFE TO STATE MY WHOLE STORY IN THE SHAPE OF A NARRATIVE
STRONGLY ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF HIGH CHURCH AND THE STUART LINE THE EXCISE MAN AS IN DUTY BOUND AND THE ATTORNEY WHO LOOKED TO SOME PETTY OFFICE UNDER THE CROWN TOGETHER WITH MY FELLOW TRAVELLER WHO SEEMED TO ENTER KEENLY INTO THE CONTEST
DOST FEAR TO RIDE WITH ME BURGER THERE IS ONE ADVANTAGE IN AN ACCUMULATION OF EVILS DIFFERING IN CAUSE AND CHARACTER THAT THE DISTRACTION WHICH THEY AFFORD BY THEIR CONTRADICTORY OPERATION PREVENTS THE PATIENT
HOWEVER DISTRESSING IT MIGHT IN OTHER RESPECTS AND AT ANOTHER TIME HAVE APPEARED TO ME SUNK INTO A SUBORDINATE CONSIDERATION WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS IMPENDING OVER MY FATHER I DID NOT MYSELF SET A HIGH ESTIMATION ON WEALTH
I DETERMINED TO CONSULT ANDREW FAIRSERVICE ON THE SUBJECT AS THE NEAREST AND MOST AUTHENTIC AUTHORITY WITHIN MY REACH LATE AS IT WAS I SET OFF WITH THE INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THIS IMPORTANT POINT AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES WALK REACHED THE DWELLING OF THE GARDENER
WHEN MISS VERNON CLEARED THE OBSTRUCTION AT A FLYING LEAP I WAS BOUND IN POINT OF HONOUR TO FOLLOW AND WAS IN A MOMENT AGAIN AT HER SIDE THERE ARE HOPES OF YOU YET SHE SAID I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD BEEN A VERY DEGENERATE OSBALDISTONE
WHICH LASTED UNTIL THEY HAD EXCHANGED ONE OR TWO SIGNIFICANT GLANCES WHATEVER THE MYSTERY MIGHT BE WHICH OVERCLOUDED THE DESTINIES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING FEMALE IT WAS CLEAR THAT FATHER VAUGHAN WAS IMPLICATED IN IT
MY FATHER AS IS WELL KNOWN TO YOU WAS OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY IN NORTHUMBERLAND FROM WHOSE SEAT I WAS WHILE EATING THE AFORESAID DINNER NOT VERY MANY MILES DISTANT THE QUARREL BETWIXT HIM AND HIS RELATIVES WAS SUCH
OF THE WORTHY DOCTOR LIGHTFOOT LIGHTFOOT I REPLIED LOOKING AT THE PONDEROUS VOLUME WITH SOME SURPRISE
AND HOW GO MARKETS IN THE SOUTH EVEN IN THE ORDINAR REPLIED MISTER CAMPBELL WISE FOLKS BUY AND SELL AND FOOLS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD BUT WISE MEN AND FOOLS BOTH EAT THEIR DINNER ANSWERED OUR JOLLY ENTERTAINER
WITHOUT HIS ABSENCE OR PRESENCE ATTRACTING ANY OBSERVATION BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE THE STAIR AND THE TURRET DOOR WERE ENTIRELY DISUSED AND THIS MADE ANDREW'S OBSERVATION SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE HAVE YOU OFTEN OBSERVED THAT DOOR OPEN
YOU SIR DOUBTLESS ARE WELL MOUNTED AND I FOR THE PRESENT TRAVEL ON FOOT OR ON A HIGHLAND SHELTY THAT DOES NOT HELP ME MUCH FASTER FORWARD SO SAYING HE CALLED FOR A RECKONING FOR THE WINE
WHICH I DOUBT NOT WILL BE DULY HONOURED I REMAIN AS IN DUTY BOUND DEAR MISTER FRANK YOUR VERY RESPECTFUL AND OBEDIENT SERVANT JOSEPH OWEN POSTSCRIPTUM
HE HAD THE WELL BRED INSINUATING AND ALMOST FLATTERING ADDRESS PECULIAR TO THE CLERGY OF HIS PERSUASION
OR DIRECT HIS DIET WHEN HE IS SEALED OR TO SUM UP MY INSIGNIFICANCE IN ONE WORD REPLIED I I AM PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT IN ALL THESE RURAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEN IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN MISTER FRANCIS OSBALDISTONE
WHAT CAN YOU DO VERY LITTLE TO THE PURPOSE MISS VERNON SOMETHING HOWEVER I CAN PRETEND TO WHEN MY GROOM HAS DRESSED MY HORSE I CAN RIDE HIM AND WHEN MY HAWK IS IN THE FIELD I CAN FLY HIM CAN YOU DO THIS
AND HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT THAT IT COULD MISCARRY UPON THE ROAD AS IT COMPRISED MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BOTH TO MY FATHER AND TO MYSELF I SAT DOWN IN THE POST OFFICE AND AGAIN WROTE TO OWEN
IN THE EXTENT AND DECIDED CHARACTER OF RASHLEIGH'S MACHINATIONS THAT I HAD SOME APPREHENSION OF HIS HAVING PROVIDED MEANS TO INTERCEPT A JOURNEY WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH A VIEW TO DISCONCERT THEM IF MY DEPARTURE WERE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE
I PAUSED THEREFORE ON A RISING GROUND AND NOT UNMOVED BY THE SENSE OF INTEREST WHICH THAT SPECIES OF SILVAN SPORT IS SO MUCH CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
AND THEN INTIMATED HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING ME THAT HE MIGHT HELP THE HUNTSMAN AND HIS BROTHERS TO COUPLE UP THE HOUNDS A PURPOSE WHICH HE RATHER COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF INFORMATION TO MISS VERNON THAN AS APOLOGY TO ME THERE HE GOES SAID THE YOUNG LADY
IF HE LACKED IT I GIVE MY VOTE AND INTEREST TO JONATHAN BROWN OUR LANDLORD TO BE THE KING AND PRINCE OF SKINKERS CONDITIONALLY THAT HE FETCHES US ANOTHER BOTTLE AS GOOD AS THE LAST THIS SALLY WAS RECEIVED WITH GENERAL APPLAUSE IN WHICH THE LANDLORD CORDIALLY JOINED
TRYSTED WITH A BOGLE SAID I WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ANDREW I SAID MISTRYSTED REPLIED ANDREW
I WAS TEMPTED FROM CURIOSITY TO DISPUTE THE GROUND WITH HIM MYSELF CONFIDING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
THE CARE OF NURSING ME DURING MY CHILDISH ILLNESSES
BY DOING SO I OBTAINED POSSESSION SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FRIEND MISTER OWEN DEAR MISTER FRANCIS YOURS RECEIVED PER FAVOUR OF MISTER R OSBALDISTONE
SAID THE TRAVELLER IN A TONE AS IF HE THOUGHT THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BEAR DOWN ALL OPPOSITION IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SAID CAMPBELL SOMEWHAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY I HAVE BUSINESS AT ROTHBURY BUT I AM IN NO GREAT HURRY
AND HERE A COMES AS PRIME A BUTTOCK OF BEEF AS E'ER HUNGRY MEN STUCK FORK IN SO SAYING HE EAGERLY WHETTED HIS KNIFE ASSUMED HIS SEAT OF EMPIRE AT THE HEAD OF THE BOARD AND LOADED THE PLATES OF HIS SUNDRY GUESTS WITH HIS GOOD CHEER
AND ALL THE WORLD OF CATHOLICS AROUND HIM WHO DEEMED HIS INTERFERENCE ON SUCH OCCASIONS AN ACT OF HERETICAL INTERLOPING I CONCEIVED IT LIKELY THEREFORE THAT THE WELL DISPOSED NEIGHBOURS MIGHT HAVE ASSEMBLED TO HOLD SOME CHAPEL OF EASE OF THIS NATURE
BUT INDEED IT'S NO MUCKLE MATTER WHAT THE FOLK DO TO THE MIDDEN POOTRY FOR THEY HAD SICCAN A SKARTING AND SCRAPING IN THE YARD THAT THERE'S NAE GETTING A BEAN OR PEA KEEPIT FOR THEM
AND THEN THERE'S THE SILLER FOR THE SEEDS I'M THINKING THE WAGE WILL BE IN A MANNER DECENTLY MADE UP BUT DOUBTLESS YOUR HONOUR WILL CONSIDER MY RISK OF LOSS WHEN WE WIN TO GLASGOW AND YE'LL BE FOR SETTING OUT FORTHWITH BY DAY BREAK IN THE MORNING
MY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ME TO TAKE UP A CORRESPONDING TONE AS I EXPRESSED MY GRATITUDE TO HER FOR HER CONDESCENSION AND MY EXTREME PLEASURE AT HAVING MET WITH THEM TO SAY THE TRUTH THE COMPLIMENT WAS SO EXPRESSED
THAT BESET HIM AS HE CAME FROM WHITSON TRYSTE THOU ART DECEIVED FRIEND JONATHAN SAID CAMPBELL INTERRUPTING HIM THEY WERE BUT BARELY TWO AND TWO COWARDLY LOONS AS MAN COULD WISH TO MEET WITHAL AND DID YOU SIR REALLY
IF IT HAD REACHED HIM IN SAFETY I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECEIPT OF THE BILL AND PROMISED TO MAKE USE OF THE CONTENTS IF I SHOULD HAVE ANY OCCASION FOR MONEY I THOUGHT INDEED IT WAS ODD
I COULD ALSO OBSERVE THE CAUTION AND SHREWDNESS OF HIS COUNTRY IN MANY OF THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HE MADE AND THE ANSWERS WHICH HE RETURNED BUT I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE AIR OF EASY SELF POSSESSION AND SUPERIORITY WITH WHICH HE SEEMED TO PREDOMINATE OVER THE COMPANY INTO WHICH HE WAS THROWN
I HIGHLY APPROVED OF ANDREW'S AMENDMENT ON MY ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND WE AGREED TO MEET AT THE PLACE APPOINTED AT THREE IN THE MORNING AT ONCE HOWEVER A REFLECTION CAME ACROSS THE MIND OF MY INTENDED TRAVELLING COMPANION
LIGHTFOOT WAS HIS NAME SIR
BUT COMMEND ME TO STERLING HONESTY THOUGH CLAD IN RAGS AS THE POET SAITH I HAVE BEEN CREDIBLY ASSURED SIR BY MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND THAT THERE WAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH A THING IN SCOTLAND AS A HIGHWAY ROBBERY
AS A RACE HOSTILE BY NATURE TO THE MORE SOUTHERN INHABITANTS OF THIS REALM AND THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER WAS NOT MUCH CORRECTED BY THE LANGUAGE WHICH MY FATHER SOMETIMES HELD WITH RESPECT TO THEM HE HAD ENGAGED IN SOME LARGE SPECULATIONS CONCERNING OAK WOODS
I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVAIL ON MYSELF TO URGE MY ACTUAL RETURN TO LONDON AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND I DISGUISED MY UNWILLINGNESS TO DO SO UNDER APPARENT SUBMISSION TO MY FATHER'S WILL
I HAD ALREADY FELT MYSELF BECOMING JEALOUS OF THE CONTEMPTIBLE LOUT THORNCLIFF AND TAKING MORE NOTICE THAN IN PRUDENCE OR DIGNITY OF FEELING I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE OF HIS SILLY ATTEMPTS TO PROVOKE ME
THAT HE SCARCELY EVER MENTIONED THE RACE FROM WHICH HE SPRUNG AND HELD AS THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE SPECIES OF VANITY THE WEAKNESS WHICH IS COMMONLY TERMED FAMILY PRIDE HIS AMBITION WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED AS WILLIAM OSBALDISTONE THE FIRST
AND MUCH RESPECTED AMONG THE CATHOLICS OF NORTHUMBERLAND AS A WORTHY AND UPRIGHT MAN YET FATHER VAUGHAN DID NOT ALTOGETHER LACK THOSE PECULIARITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH HIS ORDER THERE HUNG ABOUT HIM AN AIR OF MYSTERY WHICH IN PROTESTANT EYES
EITHER FROM MY FATHER OR OWEN ALTHOUGH RASHLEIGH HAD WRITTEN TO SIR HILDEBRAND OF HIS SAFE ARRIVAL IN LONDON AND OF THE KIND RECEPTION HE HAD MET WITH FROM HIS UNCLE ADMITTING THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO BLAME
COULD HAVE WISHED ANOTHER PERSON HAD TURNED HIS MIND THAT WAY BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE AS CASH MAY BE SCARCE IN THOSE PARTS HAVE TO TRUST YOU WILL EXCUSE MY ENCLOSING A GOLDSMITH'S BILL AT SIX DAYS SIGHT ON MESSRS
I RODE OVER TO THE POST TOWN
BUT NOW I WAS DISPOSED TO ASSIGN TO THESE COMMUNICATIONS A DEEPER AND MORE MYSTERIOUS IMPORT DID HE HOLD PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH MISS VERNON IN THE LIBRARY WAS A QUESTION WHICH OCCUPIED MY THOUGHTS AND IF SO FOR WHAT PURPOSE
IN JUSTIFICATION OR APOLOGY FOR THOSE WHO ENTERTAINED SUCH PREJUDICES I MUST REMARK THAT THE SCOTCH OF THAT PERIOD WERE GUILTY OF SIMILAR INJUSTICE TO THE ENGLISH
AND WITH A SORT OF SHEEPISH SULLENNESS SHE INSTANTLY TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS ME SAYING WELL WELL THORNIE IF YOU WON'T I MUST THAT'S ALL SIR SHE CONTINUED ADDRESSING ME
SO THAT I RETURNED TO OSBALDISTONE HALL A GOOD DEAL RICHER THAN I HAD SET FORTH THIS RECRUIT TO MY FINANCES WAS NOT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME AS I WAS NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN SOME EXPENSES AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
WHICH I STILL PREFER TO ALL THE OPERA AIRS EVER MINTED BY THE CAPRICIOUS BRAIN OF AN ITALIAN MUS D OH THE OAK THE ASH AND THE BONNY IVY TREE THEY FLOURISH BEST AT HOME IN THE NORTH COUNTRIE NOW
IT WAS WITH THAT EASY TONE OF CONFIDENCE USED BY THOSE SUPERIOR TO THEIR SOCIETY IN RANK OR INFORMATION AS IF WHAT HE SAID COULD NOT BE DOUBTED
THE TURRET DOOR TO WHICH HE ALLUDED OPENED TO THE GARDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF A WINDING STAIR LEADING DOWN FROM MISTER RASHLEIGH'S APARTMENT THIS AS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED WAS SITUATED IN A SEQUESTERED PART OF THE HOUSE
AND HAD THE AFFECTATION OF MOST YOUNG MEN OF LIVELY IMAGINATION
I WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO THINK THAT I OUGHT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO LONDON AND BY MY OPEN APPEARANCE REPEL THE CALUMNY WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD AGAINST ME BUT I HESITATED TO TAKE THIS COURSE
HIS HEBDOMADAL VISITANTS WERE OFTEN DIVIDED IN THEIR OPINION AS IRRECONCILABLY AS IF HE HAD FEASTED THE COMMON COUNCIL THE CURATE AND THE APOTHECARY WITH A LITTLE MAN WHO MADE NO BOAST OF HIS VOCATION BUT WHO
WAD LAY A GHAIST TWICE AS FAST AS HIM WI HIS HOLY WATER AND HIS IDOLATROUS TRINKETS
AND COMING UP TO ME AS THE COMPANY WERE DISPERSING OBSERVED YOUR FRIEND SIR IS TOO COMMUNICATIVE CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF HIS TRUST THAT GENTLEMAN I REPLIED LOOKING TOWARDS THE TRAVELLER IS NO FRIEND OF MINE
THAT MY FATHER SHOULD LEAVE THE CARE OF SUPPLYING MY NECESSITIES TO HIS CLERK BUT I CONCLUDED IT WAS A MATTER ARRANGED BETWEEN THEM AT ANY RATE OWEN WAS A BACHELOR RICH IN HIS WAY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO ME
HAVING IN THE HURRY OF THE CHASE ESCAPED FROM THE RIBBON WHICH BOUND IT SOME VERY BROKEN GROUND THROUGH WHICH SHE GUIDED HER HORSE WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE ADDRESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND RETARDED HER COURSE AND BROUGHT HER CLOSER TO ME THAN ANY OF THE OTHER RIDERS HAD PASSED
OUT OF THE NEIGHBOURING PAPISTS AND CHURCH OF ENGLANDMEN BRANDS AS HE EXPRESSED IT SNATCHED OUT OF THE BURNING ON WHOM HE USED TO EXERCISE HIS SPIRITUAL GIFTS
ALL OUR FAMILY RENOWN WAS ACQUIRED ALL OUR FAMILY MISFORTUNES WERE OCCASIONED BY THE NORTHERN WARS WARMED BY SUCH TALES I LOOKED UPON THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE DURING MY CHILDHOOD
AND DIE VERNON WHO HAS ALSO THE HONOUR TO BE YOUR ACCOMPLISHED COUSIN'S POOR KINSWOMAN THERE WAS A MIXTURE OF BOLDNESS SATIRE AND SIMPLICITY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH MISS VERNON PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS
ON MY ARRIVAL AT THE HALL I FOUND THAT SIR HILDEBRAND AND ALL HIS OFFSPRING HAD GONE DOWN TO THE LITTLE HAMLET CALLED TRINLAY KNOWES TO SEE
I HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE THIS CULTIVATED YOUNG GENTLEMAN TO MAKE INQUIRY OF YOU WHETHER IN THE COURSE OF YOUR TRAVELS IN THESE PARTS YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING OF A FRIEND OF OURS ONE MISTER FRANCIS OSBALDISTONE
SAID MY FELLOW TRAVELLER EDGING HIS CHAIR I SHOULD HAVE SAID HIS PORTMANTEAU NEARER TO MISTER CAMPBELL REALLY AND ACTUALLY BEAT TWO HIGHWAYMEN YOURSELF ALONE IN TROTH DID I SIR REPLIED CAMPBELL
CAMPBELL OBSERVED A SILENCE AND MODERATION WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM CAUTION THE DIVISIONS OF WHIG AND TORY THEN SHOOK ENGLAND TO HER VERY CENTRE AND A POWERFUL PARTY ENGAGED IN THE JACOBITE INTEREST
THE NOISE HOWEVER WHEN I LISTENED TO IT MORE ACCURATELY SEEMED TO PROCEED ENTIRELY FROM THE LUNGS OF THE SAID ANDREW AND WHEN I INTERRUPTED IT BY ENTERING THE HOUSE I FOUND FAIRSERVICE ALONE
WHO HAS BEEN FOR SOME DAYS EXPECTED AT OSBALDISTONE HALL I WAS TOO HAPPY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF TO BE THE PARTY INQUIRED AFTER AND TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THE OBLIGING INQUIRIES OF THE YOUNG LADY IN THAT CASE SIR SHE REJOINED
AS MY KINSMAN'S POLITENESS SEEMS TO BE STILL SLUMBERING YOU WILL PERMIT ME THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT IS HIGHLY IMPROPER TO STAND MISTRESS OF CEREMONIES AND TO PRESENT TO YOU YOUNG SQUIRE THORNCLIFF OSBALDISTONE YOUR COUSIN
WHILE THE PRIEST PRIVILEGED BY HIS ORDER TO MINGLE WITH PERSONS OF ALL CREEDS IS OPEN ALERT AND LIBERAL IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THEM DESIROUS OF POPULARITY
THEN I SUPPOSE YOU CAN NEITHER GIVE A BALL NOR A MASH NOR A HORN
AS IT WERE BY ACCIDENT HIS DRESS WAS AS COARSE AS IT COULD BE BEING STILL DECENT AND AT A TIME WHEN GREAT EXPENSE WAS LAVISHED UPON THE WARDROBE EVEN OF THE LOWEST WHO PRETENDED TO THE CHARACTER OF GENTLEMAN THIS INDICATED MEDIOCRITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THROWING DOWN THE PRICE OF THE ADDITIONAL BOTTLE WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF INTRODUCED ROSE AS IF TO TAKE LEAVE OF US
I HAVE AS YET SAID NOTHING FOR I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE HE WAS AGED ABOUT SIXTY OF A GOOD FAMILY AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND IN THE NORTH OF A STRIKING AND IMPOSING PRESENCE GRAVE IN HIS EXTERIOR
BUT HUGE ROUND HEADED AND CLOTHED WITH A DARK ROBE OF RUSSET GAINING BY THEIR EXTENT AND DESOLATE APPEARANCE AN INFLUENCE UPON THE IMAGINATION AS A DESERT DISTRICT POSSESSING A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN
BESIDES HERSELF IN OSBALDISTONE HALL YET ALTHOUGH SILENT WITH RESPECT TO FATHER VAUGHAN HIS ARRIVAL AT THE HALL NEVER FAILED TO IMPRESS MISS VERNON WITH AN ANXIOUS AND FLUTTERING TREMOR
PEEPING OUT FROM A DRUIDICAL GROVE OF HUGE OAKS AND I WAS DIRECTING MY COURSE TOWARDS IT AS STRAIGHTLY AND AS SPEEDILY AS THE WINDINGS OF A VERY INDIFFERENT ROAD WOULD PERMIT WHEN MY HORSE TIRED AS HE WAS
ANDREW'S DWELLING WAS SITUATED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE EXTERIOR WALL OF THE GARDEN A SNUG COMFORTABLE NORTHUMBRIAN COTTAGE BUILT OF STONES ROUGHLY DRESSED WITH THE HAMMER AND HAVING THE WINDOWS AND DOORS DECORATED WITH HUGE HEAVY ARCHITRAVES
AND NOW I WAS SCRUTINISING THE CONDUCT OF MISS VERNON WITH THE MOST CLOSE AND EAGER OBSERVATION WHICH I IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO PALM ON MYSELF AS THE OFFSPRING OF IDLE CURIOSITY
ALTHOUGH MY MIND WAS NOT AT THE MOMENT VERY ACCESSIBLE TO IMPRESSIONS OF THIS NATURE I EXPECTED WITH SOME EAGERNESS THE APPEARANCE OF THE HUNTSMEN THE FOX HARD RUN AND NEARLY SPENT
AND A KITCHEN GARDEN BEHIND A PADDOCK FOR A COW AND A SMALL FIELD CULTIVATED WITH SEVERAL CROPS OF GRAIN RATHER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COTTAGER THAN FOR SALE ANNOUNCED THE WARM AND CORDIAL COMFORTS WHICH OLD ENGLAND
ADDRESSED TO MY FATHER AND AS THE ORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES OF INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE HALL AND THE POST TOWN RECURRED RARELY I DETERMINED TO RIDE TO THE TOWN
OR TO MY GROOM INCREDIBLE CARELESSNESS AND YOU CANNOT SHOE A HORSE OR CUT HIS MANE AND TAIL OR WORM A DOG OR CROP HIS EARS OR CUT HIS DEW CLAWS OR RECLAIM A HAWK OR GIVE HIM HIS CASTING STONES
MOUNTED ON A BEAUTIFUL HORSE JET BLACK UNLESS WHERE HE WAS FLECKED BY SPOTS OF THE SNOW WHITE FOAM WHICH EMBOSSED HIS BRIDLE SHE WORE WHAT WAS THEN SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL A COAT VEST AND HAT
RESEMBLING THOSE OF A MAN WHICH FASHION HAS SINCE CALLED A RIDING HABIT THE MODE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED WHILE I WAS IN FRANCE AND WAS PERFECTLY NEW TO ME HER LONG BLACK HAIR STREAMED ON THE BREEZE
BUT BEFORE CONCLUDING MY LETTER CONCERNING THE AFFAIR OF MORRIS I FAILED NOT TO EXPRESS MY EARNEST HOPE AND WISH THAT MY FATHER WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A FEW LINES
FOR FEAR OF BOGLES AND BROWNIES
THE PROPERTY OF HIGHLAND PROPRIETORS AND ALLEGED THAT HE FOUND THEM MUCH MORE READY TO MAKE BARGAINS AND EXTORT EARNEST OF THE PURCHASE MONEY THAN PUNCTUAL IN COMPLYING ON THEIR SIDE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ENGAGEMENTS THE SCOTTISH MERCANTILE MEN
LED ME TO THINK THAT ANDREW ACCORDING TO THE DECENT AND MERITORIOUS CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF HIS NEIGHBOURS TO JOIN IN FAMILY EXERCISE AS HE CALLED EVENING DEVOTION
UNDER THESE DISADVANTAGES HE SEEMED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO TREAT THE REST OF THE COMPANY WITH THE COOL AND CONDESCENDING POLITENESS WHICH IMPLIES A REAL OR IMAGINED SUPERIORITY OVER THOSE TOWARDS WHOM IT IS USED WHEN HE GAVE HIS OPINION ON ANY POINT
I DID NOT DESERVE IN MY OWN OPINION AT LEAST TO BE SO TOTALLY FORGOTTEN BY MY FATHER AND I THOUGHT MY PRESENT EXCURSION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING A LETTER FROM HIM TO HAND MORE EARLY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE REACHED ME
WAS AT A CLOSE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOM WE HAD SEEN APPROACHED US WAVING THE BRUSH OF THE FOX IN TRIUMPH AS IF TO UPBRAID MY FAIR COMPANION I SEE SHE REPLIED I SEE BUT MAKE NO NOISE ABOUT IT IF PHOEBE SHE SAID
FOR A SHORT TIME AT LEAST TO MEET AND REFUTE THE INFAMOUS CALUMNIES WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED CONCERNING ME IN SO PUBLIC A MANNER HAVING MADE UP MY PACKET
AND HIS VASSALS WHILE SOLEMNIZING A FEAST
PATTING THE NECK OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL ON WHICH SHE RODE HAD NOT GOT AMONG THE CLIFFS YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE CAUSE FOR BOASTING THEY MET AS SHE SPOKE
THE CHASE I APPROACHED MY NATIVE NORTH FOR SUCH I ESTEEMED IT WITH THAT ENTHUSIASM WHICH ROMANTIC AND WILD SCENERY INSPIRES IN THE LOVERS OF NATURE NO LONGER INTERRUPTED BY THE BABBLE OF MY COMPANION
WHY A SCOTCH SORT OF A GENTLEMAN AS I SAID BEFORE RETURNED MINE HOST THEY ARE ALL GENTLE YE MUN KNOW
THOUGH WITHOUT ANY FIXED PURPOSE OF DOING SO THEY IMPRESSED MY YOUTHFUL MIND WITH A SINCERE AVERSION TO THE NORTHERN INHABITANTS OF BRITAIN AS A PEOPLE BLOODTHIRSTY IN TIME OF WAR TREACHEROUS DURING TRUCE INTERESTED SELFISH AVARICIOUS
WHEN THE HEADMOST HOUNDS FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE PACK IN FULL CRY BURST FROM THE COPPICE FOLLOWED BY THE HUNTSMAN AND THREE OR FOUR RIDERS
IN THE LEGENDS OF MABEL THE SCOTTISH NATION WAS EVER FRESHLY REMEMBERED WITH ALL THE EMBITTERED DECLAMATION OF WHICH THE NARRATOR WAS CAPABLE THE INHABITANTS OF THE OPPOSITE FRONTIER SERVED IN HER NARRATIVES TO FILL UP THE PARTS WHICH OGRES AND GIANTS
WAS IT NOT WAT THE DEVIL WHO DROVE ALL THE YEAR OLD HOGS OFF THE BRAES OF LANTHORN SIDE IN THE VERY RECENT DAYS OF MY GRANDFATHER'S FATHER AND HAD WE NOT MANY A TROPHY BUT ACCORDING TO OLD MABEL'S VERSION OF HISTORY FAR MORE HONOURABLY GAINED
ON RECOLLECTION OF MY FATHER'S DISPOSITION SINGULARLY ABSOLUTE IN HIS DECISIONS AS TO ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS FAMILY HE WAS MOST ABLE CERTAINLY FROM EXPERIENCE TO DIRECT WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
A COUNTERPART TO THIS DECENT PRACTICE AND A REMNANT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY WAS THAT THE LANDLORD OF A PRINCIPAL INN LAID ASIDE HIS CHARACTER OF A PUBLICAN ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND INVITED THE GUESTS WHO CHANCED TO BE WITHIN HIS WALLS
CHEERED BY THE OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF A FRENCH HORN WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS A CONSTANT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE CHASE I MADE NO DOUBT THAT THE PACK WAS MY UNCLE'S AND DREW UP MY HORSE WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUFFERING THE HUNTERS TO PASS WITHOUT NOTICE
WHICH I HAD AT THE TIME SUPPOSED TO BEAR REFERENCE TO SOME HINT CONCERNING MISS VERNON'S RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES KNOWING HOW ARTFULLY THE CATHOLIC CLERGY MAINTAIN AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF THEIR FOLLOWERS
MENACED THE DYNASTY OF HANOVER WHICH HAD BEEN JUST ESTABLISHED ON THE THRONE EVERY ALEHOUSE RESOUNDED WITH THE BRAWLS OF CONTENDING POLITICIANS AND AS MINE HOST'S POLITICS WERE OF THAT LIBERAL DESCRIPTION WHICH QUARRELLED WITH NO GOOD CUSTOMER
FROM THE TURRET DOOR TO A LITTLE POSTERN IN THE WALL OF THE GARDEN
AND DRESSED IN GREEN AND RED THE UNIFORM OF A SPORTING ASSOCIATION FORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OLD SIR HILDEBRAND OSBALDISTONE MY COUSINS THOUGHT I AS THEY SWEPT PAST ME THE NEXT REFLECTION WAS
THEY BRAWLED ALONG BENEATH THE SHADE OF NATURAL COPSEWOOD WERE NOW HURRIED DOWN DECLIVITIES AND NOW PURLED MORE LEISURELY BUT STILL IN ACTIVE MOTION THROUGH LITTLE LONELY VALLEYS WHICH OPENING ON THE ROAD FROM TIME TO TIME
WHICH AS I IMPOSED IT ON MYSELF AS A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR NOT URGING MY FINAL DEPARTURE FROM OSBALDISTONE HALL WOULD I DOUBTED NOT BE RECEIVED AS SUCH BY MY PARENT BUT I BEGGED PERMISSION TO COME TO LONDON
AND MAY I ASK WHAT IMPORTANT BUSINESS TAKES YOU THERE ASKED THE LITTLE WOMAN WHO WAS REALLY A WITCH MY HOUSE IS SO DREARY WITH NO ONE TO SPEAK TO I CANNOT STAY IN IT ALONE AND I AM SEEKING FOR A CHILD I DON'T MIND HOW SMALL SHE IS WHO WILL KEEP ME COMPANY
AND NOW GIVE ME THE BRACELET THAT MATCHES A JEWELLED BAND WHICH OF A SURETY FELL FROM THE ARM OF ONE OF YOU A JEW TRIED TO TAKE IT FROM ME BUT I WOULD NOT LET HIM HAVE IT
AND THEN I SHALL BE AS LONELY AS BEFORE
FOR SHE DID NOT LIKE SNAKES BUT THE LITTLE BIRD PAID NO HEED PUT THEM IN A BASKET AND GO TO THE GREEN KNIGHT'S PALACE SAID SHE AND WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THEM WHEN I GET THERE SHE CRIED BLUSHING ALL OVER THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HER BUT THE BIRD
YES THAT IT IS ANSWERED THE GOOSE GIRL FOR I AM DRIVING HIS GEESE BUT THE GREEN KNIGHT IS VERY ILL AND THEY SAY THAT UNLESS HE CAN BE CURED WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WILL SURELY DIE
AND PUT THE PACKETS CAREFULLY AWAY IN HIS TURBAN THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN DORANI LEFT FOR HER FATHER'S HOUSE IN HER PALANQUIN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PACKET OF THE MAGIC POWDER AND SPRINKLED IT OVER HIMSELF AND THEN HURRIED AFTER HER
FAREWELL FAREWELL SHE SAID
THOUGH IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS FILLED WITH WONDER
AH THAT IS THE KING OF THE FLOWER SPIRITS WHISPERED THE SWALLOW AND THE KING STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TO MAIA AND HELPED HER TO JUMP FROM THE SWALLOW'S BACK I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU FOR A LONG WHILE SAID HE AND NOW YOU HAVE COME AT LAST TO BE MY QUEEN
THE PRINCESS'S FATHER WAS AMONGST THOSE INVITED BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME AND WAS NO LONGER SCOLDED BY THE QUEEN THE POOR PRINCESS WAS DREADFULLY LONELY
FROM HER SEVERED HANDS AND HEAD THERE FELL INTO THE CAULDRON BRACELETS AND CHAINS OF RUBIES AND DIAMONDS
SO THE WINTER PASSED AWAY PLEASANTLY AND MAIA BEGAN TO TALK OF THE SPRING AND OF THE TIME WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AGAIN AND SEEK HER FORTUNE OH YOU NEED NOT BEGIN TO THINK OF THAT FOR A WHILE YET ANSWERED THE FIELD MOUSE
SHE ADDED DROPPING HER VOICE OH GOOD MISTER MOLE DO TAKE ME TO SEE IT
AND WITH A YELL OF PAIN AND ANGER SHE VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS AMEER ALI THEN SAT DOWN TO COLLECT HIMSELF A LITTLE AND FELT UPON THE GROUND BY HIS SIDE AN ANKLET THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN OFF THE OLD WITCH'S FOOT
TILL ITS FELLOW WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE JEW AND THE BOY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES SAID WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO FIND THE OTHER ONE BUT AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO USE IN DISPUTING THE DECISION
TO BID FAREWELL TO THE YOUNG COUPLE IN SPITE OF HER GRIEF FOR THE DEAD KING THE QUEEN WAS OVERJOYED TO WELCOME HER SON HOME AND COMMANDED THE PALACE TO BE HUNG WITH SPLENDID STUFFS TO DO HONOUR TO THE BRIDE THE PEOPLE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS FROM THEIR NEW SOVEREIGN
INSTEAD OF SPEAKING KINDLY AND LOVINGLY AS BEFORE HER WORDS BECAME ROUGH AND CRUEL AND ONCE OR TWICE SHE EVEN SLAPPED THE PRINCESS'S FACE THE KING WAS VERY UNHAPPY AT SEEING HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER SUFFER
THIS THEY TIED TO THEIR NECKS WITH SOME OF THE TOUGH WATER LILY ROOTS AND RETURNED AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD TO THE TURTLE NOW SAID THE ELDER DUCK PUSHING THE STICK GENTLY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND TAKE THIS STICK FIRMLY IN YOUR MOUTH
THIS WAS HER BED AND STOOD ON A CHAIR CLOSE TO WHERE HER FOSTER MOTHER WAS SLEEPING BUT IN THE MORNING SHE WAS LIFTED OUT AND PLACED ON A LEAF IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE BOWL OF WATER AND GIVEN TWO WHITE HORSE HAIRS TO ROW HERSELF ABOUT WITH
BAD PEOPLE GOOD NEVER DOING ANYTHING HE WISHED TO DO NOT ABLE EVEN TO MARRY THE GIRL THAT HE LOVED
AND WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCE HE CAME AND BOWED HIMSELF TO HIM AND SAID CHILD CHILD WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD IS AUGHT THE MATTER THEN THE PRINCE REPLIED I AM SAD OLD FRIEND
AND THAT UNLESS HE COULD BE CURED WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WOULD SURELY DIE THE PRINCESS THOUGHT OF THE SNAKES AND THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND LIFTING HER HEAD FROM THE POTS AND PANS SHE WAS SCOURING SHE SAID I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A SOUP THAT HAS SUCH A WONDERFUL POWER
WHERE THE STOOL AWAITED THEM MORE UNSTEADILY THAN BEFORE IT FLEW BACK TO EARTH WHEN DORANI GOT TO THE PALACE THAT MORNING SHE ASKED THE PRINCE WHETHER HE HAD DREAMT AGAIN HE LAUGHED WITH HAPPINESS
THE BIRD HOWEVER HAD FLOWN AWAY AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GO TO HER FATHER'S PALACE AND LOOK FOR THE SNAKES
SHE WOULD WALK WITH THEM TO THE DOOR AND WAIT TILL A PUFF OF WIND BLEW THE CORN EARS APART AND SHE COULD SEE THE SKY IF THE SWALLOW WOULD ONLY COME NOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF I WOULD GO WITH HIM TO THE END OF THE WORLD
THAT THE WEIGHT OF IT WAS OFTEN UNBEARABLE AND ONE DAY SHE CUT OFF A SHINING TRESS AND WRAPPING IT IN A LARGE LEAF THREW IT IN THE RIVER WHICH RAN JUST BELOW HER WINDOW NOW IT HAPPENED
AND THREW IT BACK INTO THE SEA AND THEN BEGAN HIS JOURNEY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED IT HE FOUND THE KING IN A HIGH FEVER CAUSED BY HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THE STORY TOLD HIM BY HIS SON YOUR HEAD SHALL PAY FOR IT
AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO CRY ONCE MORE AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS SO FAST AND SHE SOBBED SO BITTERLY THAT HER FATHER FELT QUITE MISERABLE TOO HE REMEMBERED THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN ALWAYS TO DO WHAT HIS DAUGHTER ASKED HIM
THAT MAN IS OUR KING IN A FEW MINUTES THE PIGEON WILL FLY WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS EVERY EYE WAS FIXED ON THE TALL TOWER WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CHIEF SQUARE
WHERE ALL THE STREETS AND SQUARES WERE SO FULL OF PEOPLE HE COULD HARDLY PASS BETWEEN THEM WHY ARE ALL THESE CROWDS GATHERED TOGETHER HE ASKED OF A MAN WHO STOOD NEXT HIM THE RULER OF THIS COUNTRY IS DEAD
WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
WELL THEN ANSWERED THE DUCK WHILST WE ARE CARRYING YOU THROUGH THE AIR
AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
NOW IN THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE THERE HUNG TWO CAGES IN ONE OF WHICH WAS A PARROT AND IN THE OTHER A STARLING AND THESE TWO BIRDS COULD TALK AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE BOTH PETS OF THE PRINCESS WHO ALWAYS FED THEM HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY AS SHE WAS
HE HAD TORN HIS WING IN A ROSEBUSH SO THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE TO WARMER LANDS IN THEIR SWIFT COURSE THEY NEVER NOTICED THAT THEIR LITTLE BROTHER WAS NOT WITH THEM
I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU ANSWERED THE YOUTH BUT IT MAY BE LONG BEFORE WE MEET AGAIN FOR I SHALL NEVER REST TILL I HAVE FOUND FEAR THEN HE WENT HIS WAY AND WON THE BRACELET FROM THE KADI
THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AGAIN AS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE BUT DORANI SANG
SO GATHERING UP ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE A MIGHTY HEAVE AND THREW THE GIRL BACKWARDS AS SHE TOUCHED THE GROUND A BRACELET FELL FROM HER ARM AND THIS THE YOUTH PICKED UP
YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE DEAR LITTLE MAIA SAID HE BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU UNLESS HE ADDED YOU WILL LET ME CARRY YOU ON MY BACK FAR AWAY FROM THIS GLOOMY PRISON MAIA'S EYES SPARKLED AT THE THOUGHT
AT THE END OF A YEAR YOU CAN SEE WHAT MY SERVICES ARE WORTH TO YOU AND CAN PAY ME IN ANY WAY YOU LIKE
PRESENTLY AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A THICKET HE SAW A PIGEON WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A GOOD DINNER SO HE FIRED A PELLET AT IT FROM HIS GALAIL BUT MISSED THE PIGEON WHICH FLUTTERED AWAY WITH A STARTLED CLATTER AT THE SAME INSTANT HE HEARD A GREAT CLAMOUR FROM BEYOND THE THICKET
WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE LAKE WHERE TWO WILD DUCKS MADE THEIR HOME AND PASSED THEIR DAYS SWIMMING AND PLAYING IN ITS CLEAR WATERS
WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
TURNING THE WOOL AND COTTON INTO TINY GARMENTS MAIA LIKED THE CLOTHES BUT HATED THE THOUGHT OF THE BLIND MOLE ONLY SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ESCAPE HIM
AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
AND AT LAST SHE BECAME SO WRETCHED THAT HE COULD NO LONGER BEAR IT CALLING HER TO HIM ONE DAY HE SAID MY DAUGHTER YOU ARE NO LONGER MERRY AS YOU SHOULD BE AND I FEAR THAT IT IS THE FAULT OF YOUR STEP MOTHER IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO LIVE WITH HER NO LONGER
OH IF THAT IS ALL YOU NEED GO NO FURTHER REPLIED THE WITCH PUTTING HER HAND IN HER POCKET LOOK HERE IS A BARLEY CORN AS A FAVOUR YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR TWELVE SHILLINGS AND IF YOU PLANT IT IN A FLOWER POT AND GIVE IT PLENTY OF WATER
NEVER MIND DO AS I BID YOU I HAVE A REASON FOR IT ANSWERED THE ARAB
AND HAD COME THERE BEFORE THEM AND LUCKILY INSTEAD OF TAKING A DISLIKE TO THE TURTLE
WAS THE REPLY AND AS HE HAD NO CHILDREN IT IS NEEDFUL TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR THEREFORE EACH MORNING ONE OF THE SACRED PIGEONS IS LET LOOSE FROM THE TOWER YONDER AND ON WHOMSOEVER THE BIRD SHALL PERCH
AND AS IT WAS ALL ABOUT YOU I AM GOING TO TELL IT YOU ALTHOUGH YOU HEED NOTHING THE GIRL INDEED TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS WORDS
BUT I HAVE RECEIVED A SUMMONS AND I DARE NOT DISOBEY IT THE KING WAS SILENT TRYING TO CHOKE DOWN THE GRIEF HE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WELL
THAT THE KING'S SON WAS OUT HUNTING AND HAD GONE DOWN TO THE RIVER TO DRINK WHEN THERE FLOATED TOWARDS HIM A FOLDED LEAF FROM WHICH CAME A PERFUME OF ROSES THE PRINCE WITH IDLE CURIOSITY
THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
THAT I LAY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE GROUND FOR HOURS REPLIED THE SECOND BUT YOU MY SISTER ADDED SHE TURNING TO THE THIRD GIRL TO WHOM DO YOU DRINK DOWN IN THE SEA I TOOK HOLD OF A SHIP
BUT THAT HE WOULD NEVER DO OH YES THAT IS EASY ENOUGH CRIED THE PRINCESS DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT AFTER ALL THEY NEED NOT BE PARTED AND SHE RAN OFF TO FIND HER FATHER AND BEG HIM TO MARRY THE LADY AT ONCE
BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD BRAVELY YES YOU MUST GO BUT I MUST STAY BEHIND SHE ANSWERED THE FIELD MOUSE HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME AND I CANNOT DESERT HER LIKE THAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN OPEN THE HOLE FOR YOURSELF SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY IF SO
SO SHE TOOK OFF HER SASH WHICH JUST MATCHED HIM AND TIED IT ROUND HIS BODY SO THAT WITH THIS NEW KIND OF HORSE SHE TRAVELLED MUCH FASTER THAN BEFORE UNLUCKILY A GREAT COCKCHAFER WHO WAS BUZZING OVER THE RIVER HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF HER AND CAUGHT HER UP IN HIS CLAWS
WHEN HE GOT TO THE CHURCHYARD HE COLLECTED SOME STICKS AND MADE A FIRE THEN HE FILLED THE POT WITH WATER FROM A LITTLE STREAM CLOSE BY AND MIXING THE FLOUR AND BUTTER AND SUGAR TOGETHER HE SET THE CAKE ON TO COOK
AND BENT SO THAT THE OLD WOMAN COULD CLAMBER ON TO HIS BACK WHICH SHE DID VERY NIMBLY THEN SUDDENLY HE FELT A NOOSE SLIPPED OVER HIS NECK
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE I MAY FIND THE GREEN KNIGHT NO THEY WERE VERY SORRY BUT NONE HAD EVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON EITHER CERTAINLY HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE AT THIS THE KING GREW TROUBLED AND NOT EVEN THE BANQUET OR THE TOURNAMENT COULD MAKE HIM FEEL HAPPIER
BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
SHE WOULD MAKE A NICE WIFE FOR MY SON AND PICKING UP THE WALNUT CRADLE IN HER MOUTH SHE HOPPED WITH IT TO THE EDGE OF A STREAM WHICH RAN THROUGH THE GARDEN COME AND SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU CALLED THE OLD FROG WHEN SHE REACHED HER HOME IN THE MUD
THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
HIS SON'S AFFAIR AND THE GIRL WOULD SURELY SOON GET TIRED OF GOING TO AND FRO SO HE MADE NO DIFFICULTY AND EVERYTHING WAS SPEEDILY ARRANGED AND THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT REJOICINGS AT FIRST
BUT NOT SO THE TURTLE AT FIRST HE KEPT SILENCE AS HE HAD BEEN BIDDEN TO DO BUT AT LENGTH THE CLAMOUR BELOW PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT EVERYONE WAS ENVYING HIM THE POWER OF TRAVELLING THROUGH THE AIR
I CANNOT FLY OF COURSE ANSWERED THE TURTLE WITH A SIGH BUT YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND HAVE SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD SURELY YOU CAN THINK OF SOME PLAN AND HE FIXED HIS EYES EAGERLY ON THEM
WHO AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE WAS THE FAVOURITE FRIEND OF DORANI THE FAIRY STOOD WAITING ON THE THRESHOLD AS BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED AS DORANI HERSELF WAS AND WHEN THE STOOL STOPPED AT HER DOOR SHE CRIED IN ASTONISHMENT
PRESENTLY HE CAME TO A SECOND FOREST AND THERE HE MET ANOTHER SWINEHERD DRIVING PIGS WHOSE BEASTS ARE THOSE MY MAN HE ASKED THEY ARE THE GREEN KNIGHT'S SAID THE MAN AND WHERE DOES HE LIVE INQUIRED THE KING OH NOT FAR FROM HERE WAS THE REPLY
HE AT LENGTH DID AS SHE DESIRED AND GAVE THE PROMISE AFTER WHICH SHE BECAME QUITE HAPPY AND DIED IT HAPPENED THAT NEAR THE KING'S PALACE LIVED A NOBLE LADY WHOSE LITTLE GIRL WAS OF ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS THE PRINCESS
THOUGH HE WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE LET HER SEE IT AND HE ADMIRED HER VOICE WHEN SHE SANG MARY MARY QUITE CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW
WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
ONE OF ATTAR OF ROSES AND ONE OF WATER IN THESE SHE WASHED HERSELF AND AFTERWARDS CALLED FOR FOOD A SERVANT BROUGHT HER A BOWL OF CURDS WHICH SHE ATE HASTILY AND THEN ARRAYED HERSELF
AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
BUT OF COURSE SOMEBODY RAN AT ONCE TO THE QUEEN AND TOLD HER OF THE KING'S ORDER AND SHE PUT COMMON CLOTHES ON THE PRINCE AND FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH GOLD AND HURRIED HIM ON BOARD A SHIP WHICH WAS SAILING THAT NIGHT FOR A DISTANT ISLAND YOUR FATHER WILL REPENT SOME DAY
I HAVE NEVER MET EITHER YOU OR YOUR DAUGHTER HE SAID AT LAST BUT YOU ARE VERY WELCOME ALL THE SAME AND HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE CASTLE
THAT HAD HAPPENED THE EVENING BEFORE LEAVING OUT NO DETAIL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SEEN OR HEARD AND WHEN HE PRAISED HER SINGING AND HIS VOICE SHOOK A LITTLE DORANI JUST LOOKED AT HIM BUT SHE SAID NAUGHT
THAT ONE IS THE PRETTIEST OF ALL AND IT SMELLS SO SWEET THEN THE SWALLOW FLEW DOWN TOWARDS IT BUT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEY SAW A TINY LITTLE MANIKIN WITH A CROWN ON HIS HEAD AND WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS BALANCING HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE LEAVES
AND INDEED IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT HE DID NOT MENTION IT TO THE PRINCESS HOWEVER WHEN HE REACHED HOME IN THE EVENING HE FELT SO ILL HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED WITH NO ONE TO ATTEND ON HIM EXCEPT HIS OLD NURSE BUT OF THIS OF COURSE THE PRINCESS KNEW NOTHING
THE OTHER PART WAS A COMPLETE DESERT
THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
AND FREED THE SHIP AND BOUND ME TO A ROCK TO HIS HEALTH I DRINK AND THEY ALL THREE LIFTED THEIR CUPS AND DRANK SILENTLY AS THEY PUT THEIR CUPS DOWN THE YOUTH APPEARED BEFORE THEM
YES WE DO ANSWERED THE COOK WHO WAS TOO BUSY TO ASK THE NEW COMER MANY QUESTIONS THE FOLLOWING DAY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST THE PRINCESS SET ABOUT HER NEW DUTIES THE OTHER SERVANTS WERE SPEAKING OF THEIR MASTER AND SAYING TO EACH OTHER HOW ILL HE WAS
COME AND SIT HERE AND GET WARM AND SHARE MY DINNER WITH ME MAIA ALMOST WEPT WITH JOY AT THE OLD MOUSE'S KIND WORDS SHE NEEDED NO SECOND BIDDING BUT ATE MORE THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE IN HER LIFE THOUGH IT WAS NOT A BREAKFAST FOR A HUMMING BIRD
AND HE REPLIED NO BUT I BEGIN TO DREAM NOW NOT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THAT DAY DORANI SAT VERY QUIETLY BUT SHE ANSWERED THE PRINCE WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER
THAT HE WAS A MESSENGER SENT BY THE QUEEN OF EGYPT PROCLAIMING HIM KING IN SUCCESSION TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS DEAD HER MAJESTY BEGS YOU WILL SET OUT WITHOUT DELAY
IT WAS A CURIOUS SHAPE SO LONG AND NARROW ALMOST LIKE
THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
I HAVE BURROWED A PASSAGE FROM THIS HOUSE TO MY OWN IN WHICH YOU CAN WALK BUT I WARN YOU NOT TO BE FRIGHTENED AT A GREAT DEAD CREATURE THAT HAS FALLEN THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROOF AND IS LYING ON ONE SIDE WHAT SORT OF CREATURE IS IT ASKED MAIA EAGERLY
AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
WHAT CAN HAVE SCRATCHED SO BUT LOOK AS HE MIGHT ONLY A TINY MARK WAS TO BE SEEN
I HAVE COME SIR TO GIVE YOU MY DAUGHTER'S GREETING BUT I HAVE WANDERED FAR AND LOST MY WAY IN YOUR FOREST
BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
AND THE POOR GIRL FEARING LEST SOME EVIL SHOULD HAVE BEFALLEN HIM OR SOME OTHER MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE SHOULD HAVE STOLEN HIS HEART FROM HER GREW ALMOST SICK WITH WAITING LONELY INDEED SHE WAS FOR HER FATHER WHO WOULD HAVE HELPED HER
SHE IS VERY UGLY TO BE SURE BUT ONE OUGHT TO PITY HER FOR SHE HAS ONLY TWO LEGS YES AND NO FEELERS ADDED ANOTHER
THE GREEN KNIGHT THERE LIVED ONCE A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD AN ONLY DAUGHTER A CHARMING AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL DEARER TO THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD WHEN THE PRINCESS WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD THE QUEEN FELL SICK
AND SHE TOLD HER FATHER THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF SHE WERE DEAD HE DID HIS BEST TO COMFORT HER AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD SOON RETURN WAS THERE ANYTHING HE COULD DO TO HELP HER YES SHE SAID YOU MAY GREET THE GREEN KNIGHT FROM ME
THEY SPLASHED JOYFULLY ABOUT AND SHOOK THEMSELVES AND THEN DIVED TO THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP POOL WHEN THEY APPEARED AGAIN THEY WERE NO LONGER THREE DOVES BUT THREE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS
AND DORANI HEARD OF IT WITH THE REST AND ONE DAY SHE SAID TO HER FATHER IF THE HAIR IS MINE AND THE KING REQUIRES ME TO MARRY HIS SON I MUST DO SO BUT REMEMBER YOU MUST TELL HIM THAT IF AFTER THE WEDDING
AND SHE WALKED BOLDLY DOWN THE PASSAGE BY AND BY SHE CAME TO A DOOR WHICH STOOD AJAR AND PEEPING IN DISCOVERED A WHOLE ROOM FULL OF CORN
AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR YOUR OWN AND SLEEP ALL NIGHT CURLED UP IN ITS LEAVES I WILL HAVE THAT ONE ANSWERED MAIA POINTING TO A WHITE FLOWER SHAPED LIKE A STAR WITH A TINY CRINKLED WREATH OF RED AND YELLOW IN ITS CENTRE AND A LONG STEM THAT SWAYED IN THE WIND
AND PASSED THE WHOLE DAY SINGING TO HERSELF IN A LANGUAGE OF HER OWN THAT NOBODY ELSE COULD UNDERSTAND FOR SOME WEEKS THE TWO LIVED TOGETHER AND NEVER GREW TIRED OF EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY AND THEN A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE HAPPENED ONE NIGHT
HE HAD MANY TIMES PROVED THAT HIS MOTHER WAS WISER THAN HE SO HE PROMISED OBEDIENCE AFTER A VOYAGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS HE ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN IT WAS FULL OF HILLS AND WOODS AND FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSES STOOD EVERYWHERE IN GARDENS
AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
IN WHICH THE KADI WAS ADMINISTERING JUSTICE HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY TO WHAT EACH HAD TO SAY AND THEN PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT NEITHER OF THE TWO CLAIMANTS HAD PROVED HIS RIGHT TO THE BRACELET THEREFORE IT MUST REMAIN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE JUDGE
AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
AND CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES EVERY MORNING WITH PETITIONS IN THEIR HANDS
IN A ROBE OF SILVER AND WOUND ABOUT HER STRINGS OF PEARLS WHILE A WREATH OF ROSES CROWNED HER HAIR WHEN FULLY DRESSED SHE SEATED HERSELF UPON A FOUR LEGGED STOOL OVER WHICH WAS A CANOPY WITH SILKEN CURTAINS
IT IS TOO LATE MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD STUDIED IN THE SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALL THE SAME PUT THE FISH IN THAT VESSEL FULL OF WATER AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO SHOW MY FATHER THAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD BUT WHEN HE DREW NEAR THE FISH IT LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH SUCH PITEOUS EYES
TOOK A STEP INTO THE WATER AND CAUGHT THE LEAF AS IT WAS SAILING BY HE OPENED IT AND WITHIN HE FOUND A LOCK OF HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD AND FROM WHICH CAME A FAINT EXQUISITE ODOUR
SHE SAID TO THE PRINCE IF YOU LOVE ME PROVE IT BY NOT FOLLOWING ME TO NIGHT AND SO THE PRINCE DID AS SHE WISHED AND STAYED AT HOME THAT EVENING THE MAGIC STOOL FLEW SO UNSTEADILY
PAST MANY TOWNS SHE WENT AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BANKS ALL TURNED TO LOOK AT HER AND EXCLAIMED WHAT A LOVELY LITTLE GIRL WHERE CAN SHE HAVE COME FROM WHAT A LOVELY LITTLE GIRL TWITTERED THE BIRDS IN THE BUSHES AND A BLUE BUTTERFLY FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND WOULD NOT LEAVE HER
THIS GAVE HER HEART AND SHE WENT ON MORE SWIFTLY TILL SHE REACHED A KITCHEN WHERE AN OLD FIELD MOUSE WAS BAKING A CAKE YOU POOR LITTLE ANIMAL CRIED THE MOUSE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE HER BEFORE YOU LOOK STARVED TO DEATH
UP ON THE EARTH THEY HAVE A PROVERB WHEN THE DAY LENGTHENS THEN THE COLD STRENGTHENS IT HAS BEEN QUITE WARM UP TO NOW AND THE SNOW MAY FALL ANY TIME NEVER A WINTER GOES BY WITHOUT IT AND THEN YOU WILL BE VERY THANKFUL YOU ARE HERE AND NOT OUTSIDE
THAT NIGHT THE ARAB STOLE DOWN TO THE SHORE TO WATCH BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE RUBBED HIMSELF ALL OVER WITH SOME OIL WHICH MADE HIS SKIN SMART SO BADLY THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO SLEEP AS THE SOLDIERS HAD DONE THEN HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE ROCK AND WAITED
SITTING ROUND A FIRE THE BOY WHO WAS COLD AND TIRED WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THE BRIGHT FLAMES SO HE WENT UP TO THEM AND SAID GOOD GREETING TO YOU SIRS AND WRIGGLED HIMSELF IN BETWEEN THE MEN
HE SOON FOUND THAT AS THE OLD MAN HAD PROMISED HE WAS INVISIBLE TO EVERYONE ALTHOUGH HE FELT AS USUAL AND COULD SEE ALL THAT PASSED
PROMISE ME THAT WHATEVER OUR DAUGHTER ASKS YOU WILL DO NO MATTER WHETHER YOU WISH TO OR NOT THE KING AT FIRST HESITATED BUT AS SHE ADDED UNLESS YOU PROMISE THIS I CANNOT DIE IN PEACE
YOU MUST NEVER COME HERE AGAIN SAID HE FOR ONCE HAVING ASKED SO MUCH HOW WILL YOU IN FUTURE BE CONTENT WITH SMALLER GIFTS DORANI BOWED HER HEAD SILENTLY AS SHE TOOK THE LUTE AND PASSED WITH THE FAIRY OUT OF THE GREAT GATE
THE POOR BUTTERFLY WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM AND HE STRUGGLED HARD TO FREE HIMSELF SO THAT THE SASH BOW GAVE WAY AND HE FLEW OFF INTO THE SUNSHINE BUT MAIA WASN'T SO FORTUNATE AND THOUGH THE COCKCHAFER COLLECTED HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS FOR HER DINNER
TILL AT LENGTH IT RESTED ON THE HEAD OF THE BOY THEN A GREAT SHOUT AROSE
THEN SHE ENTERED ANOTHER DOORWAY AT THE END OF A PASSAGE WHERE SHE REMOVED ANOTHER VEIL NEXT SHE MOUNTED THE STAIRS AND AT THE DOOR OF THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS REMOVED A THIRD VEIL AFTER THIS SHE PROCEEDED TO HER OWN ROOM
WHILE ON DECK THE CREW WERE GATHERED WITH FACES WHITE AS DEATH SHRIEKING AND WRINGING THEIR HANDS HAVE YOU MET WITH FEAR SHOUTED THE BOY AND THE ANSWER CAME ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE WAVES
SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY AT LENGTH HER SOBS WERE HEARD BY THE OLD FROG WHO WAS BUSY IN HER HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARSH TWISTING RUSHES INTO A SOFT CARPET FOR MAIA'S FEET AND TWINING REEDS AND GRAPES OVER THE DOORWAY TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY FOR THE BRIDE
AND THEY FLEW ON AND ON ONLY HALTING FOR SHORT RESTS TILL THEY REACHED A PLACE COVERED WITH TALL WHITE MARBLE PILLARS SOME STANDING HIGH WREATHED IN VINES OUT OF WHICH ENDLESS SWALLOWS HEADS WERE PEEPING OTHERS LYING STRETCHED AMONG THE FLOWERS
AND IN THE SWING A CHILD WAS SEATED WEEPING BITTERLY THAT IS A STRANGE PLACE FOR A SWING THOUGHT THE BOY BUT I WONDER WHAT HE IS CRYING ABOUT AND HE WAS HURRYING ON TOWARDS THE CHILD
AND AS THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF IT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE PERSISTED THE PRINCESS TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND IT SHALL BE DONE SO AT LAST HER FRIEND TOLD HER IF THE KING YOUR FATHER WOULD MAKE ME HIS QUEEN I WOULD STAY SHE SAID
GROWING PALE AS HE LISTENED IN PRISON REPLIED THE FARMER IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL CLEAR THIS COURT OF THE JACKALS I WILL EXPLAIN CLEAR THE COURT COMMANDED THE KING AND VERY UNWILLINGLY THE VISITORS LEFT THE PALACE NOW
AND WHEN NIGHT FELL SHE WOULD SING TO HER HARP OR THE PRINCE WOULD TELL HER TALES OF HIS OWN COUNTRY ONE EVENING A MAN IN A STRANGE GARB WITH A FACE BURNT BROWN BY THE SUN ARRIVED AT COURT HE ASKED TO SEE THE BRIDEGROOM AND FALLING ON HIS FACE ANNOUNCED
AH YES POOR USELESS CREATURE ANSWERED THE FIELD MOUSE BUT WHILE THEY WERE TALKING MAIA CREPT ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND STROKED THE FEATHERS OF THE LITTLE SWALLOW AND KISSED HIS EYES ALL THAT NIGHT SHE LAY AWAKE
RETIRED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS TO SUP BY THEMSELVES FOR SUCH WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
AND HE DRAGGED ME BEFORE THE KADI WHO KEPT MY BRACELET TILL I COULD SHOW HIM ITS FELLOW AND I HAVE BEEN WANDERING HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF IT AND THAT IS HOW I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN SUCH STRANGE PLACES
A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE ARRIVED AT A CITY AND AS HE WAS NOW IN GREAT STRAITS
WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
WHILST FROM THE FOOT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF SOBBING THAT THE KING HAD HEARD
AFTER THIS HE AGAIN SET FORTH IN HIS QUEST OF FEAR ON AND ON WALKED THE YOUTH BUT FEAR NEVER CROSSED HIS PATH AND ONE DAY HE ENTERED A LARGE TOWN
AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS WAS WILD WITH JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING HER FRIENDS SO NEAR HER THE LADY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AND FOR A LONG TIME ALL WENT WELL THEY WERE VERY KIND TO THE MOTHERLESS PRINCESS
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND WAS NOT MERELY THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE AS HE HAD SUPPOSED BUT THE KING OF A POWERFUL COUNTRY HE AT ONCE ORDERED A SPLENDID SHIP TO BE MADE READY
AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
THE PEOPLE WERE SO ASTONISHED AT THE STRANGE SIGHT THAT THEY ALL MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RAN OUT TO SEE IT AND CRIED TO EACH OTHER LOOK LOOK BEHOLD A MIRACLE TWO DUCKS SUPPORTING A TURTLE
WAS BUILT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A FOREST AND AS THEY HAD NO NEIGHBOURS THE PLACE WAS VERY LONELY AND THE BOY WAS KEPT AT HOME BY HIS MOTHER TO BEAR HER COMPANY THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A WINTER'S EVENING WHEN A STORM SUDDENLY SPRANG UP
AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
TO FEAR NOTHING AND NEVER TO SPEAK A WORD DURING THE WHOLE JOURNEY THIS BEING SETTLED THE DUCKS SWAM ABOUT TILL THEY FOUND FLOATING IN THE LAKE A GOOD STOUT STICK
AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY BUT BEFORE HE COULD UTTER A WORD HE WAS RUSHING SO SWIFTLY THROUGH THE AIR THAT HE QUICKLY BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND IN THIS STATE WAS DASHED TO PIECES AGAINST THE SIDE OF A HOUSE
BEARING BETWEEN THEM A TABLE MADE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ON THIS THEY PLACED DRINKING CUPS FASHIONED FROM PINK AND GREEN SHELLS AND ONE OF THE MAIDENS FILLED A CUP FROM A CRYSTAL GOBLET
BUT NO LAKE WAS TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE STILL THE TURTLE HAD FAITH IN HIS FRIENDS AND BRAVELY HUNG ON TO THE STICK AT LENGTH THEY SAW IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL VILLAGE AND VERY SOON THEY WERE PASSING OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES
THAT IS ONE COMFORT SHE ANSWERED WEEPING
I WAS THERE ANSWERED THE PRINCE BUT WHY DO YOU FOLLOW ME ASKED THE GIRL BECAUSE REPLIED THE PRINCE I LOVE YOU AND TO BE WITH YOU IS HAPPINESS
A FEAR OF SOMETHING YOU HARDLY KNOW WHAT TAKES HOLD OF YOU IT MUST BE VERY ODD TO FEEL LIKE THAT REPLIED THE BOY I WILL GO THROUGH THE WORLD AND SEEK FEAR TILL I FIND IT AND THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE HIS MOTHER WAS OUT OF BED
NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE FARMER I WOULD ONLY REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JACKALS GATHERED TO DAY TO TRY AND CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KINGDOM EVERY CITY HAS SENT THEM AND THEY WAIT HUNGRY AND EAGER BUT DO NOT O KING MISTAKE OR PRETEND AGAIN
ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
TILL SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF CLOSE TO AN OPENING WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD UNDERGROUND IT WILL BE WARM AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MAIA AND PERHAPS THE PERSON WHO LIVES THERE WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT AT ANY RATE I CAN'T BE WORSE OFF THAN I AM NOW
WHY DOESN'T SHE WEAR TWO OF THEM INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT WITH ONE LEG ADORNED AND THE OTHER EMPTY WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THIS SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SENDING FOR HER FATHER
AND NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE FOR HER WAS OF ANY USE ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE KINGDOM DID THEIR BEST TO CURE HER BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS SHE GREW WORSE AND WORSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DIE SHE SENT FOR THE KING AND SAID TO HIM
OR OF THE ROARING RIVER AS FOR GHOSTS AND WITCHES THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED HIM SO HE WALKED UP TOWARDS THE GALLOWS WHERE CROUCHED THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN WHAT AILS YOU HE SAID NOW THE WOMAN WAS NOT REALLY A WOMAN AT ALL
AND BORE DORANI AND HER HUSBAND SAFELY TO THE SCENT SELLER'S SHOP HERE THE PRINCE HURRIED AWAY BY HIMSELF PAST DORANI'S PALANQUIN WITH ITS SLEEPY BEARERS STRAIGHT ON TO THE PALACE AND AS HE PASSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS OWN ROOMS
AND MAIA SMILED AND STOOD BESIDE HIM AS ALL THE FAIRIES THAT DWELT IN THE FLOWERS RAN TO FETCH PRESENTS FOR HER AND THE BEST OF THEM ALL WAS A PAIR OF LOVELY GAUZY BLUE WINGS TO HELP FLY ABOUT LIKE ONE OF THEMSELVES
WE'LL CALL THE GUARD AND ASK AND IF IT WAS A JACKAL I'LL LEAVE THIS KINGDOM TO YOU AND GO AWAY AND IF IT WAS A TIGER THEN YOU SHALL GO AND I WILL MARRY A NEW WIFE AS YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE QUEEN THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT WHICH IT WAS
TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
BUT HE HATED THE SUN AND THE TREES AND THE FLOWERS AND ALL THAT MAIA LOVED BEST TO BE SURE BEING BLIND HE HAD NEVER SEEN THEM AND LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE HE THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING HE DID NOT KNOW WAS NOT WORTH KNOWING BUT MAIA'S TALES AMUSED HIM
HE HAD LEFT THE FOREST BEHIND HIM AFTER WALKING FOR SOME HOURS HE REACHED A MOUNTAIN WHICH HE BEGAN TO CLIMB NEAR THE TOP IN A WILD AND ROCKY SPOT HE CAME UPON A BAND OF FIERCE ROBBERS
MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
YOUR HEAD SHALL PAY FOR IT CRIED HE
AND OFF SHE WENT BACK TO THE FIELD MOUSE WHO WAS SOUND ASLEEP AFTER SOME DAYS OF MAIA'S CAREFUL NURSING THE SWALLOW FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TALK AND HE TOLD MAIA HOW HE CAME TO BE IN THE PLACE WHERE SHE FOUND HIM BEFORE HE WAS BIG ENOUGH TO FLY VERY HIGH
THERE IS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR YOU SAID ONE AT LENGTH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN LIES A DEEP POOL GO TO THAT AND PERHAPS YOU MAY MEET FEAR ON THE WAY
WHITE YELLOW AND BLUE I LIVE UP THERE SAID THE SWALLOW POINTING TO THE TALLEST OF THE PILLARS BUT SUCH A HOUSE WOULD NEVER DO FOR YOU AS YOU WOULD ONLY FALL OUT OF IT AND KILL YOURSELF SO CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE FLOWERS BELOW
YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT THE LUCK MUST TURN AT LAST AND SO IT HAS
THE CONDITION ATTACHING TO HIS WEDDING WITH THE LOVELY DORANI TROUBLED THE PRINCE VERY LITTLE FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST SEE HIS BRIDE ALL DAY BUT TO HIS DISMAY HE FOUND THAT SHE WOULD DO NOTHING BUT SIT THE WHOLE TIME UPON A STOOL
WHEN THIS WAS READY SHE CARRIED SOME TO THE KNIGHT'S ROOM AND ENTERED IT BOLDLY PUSHING ASIDE ALL THE LEARNED DOCTORS WHO STOOD BESIDE HIS BED THE POOR KNIGHT WAS TOO ILL TO KNOW HER BESIDES SHE WAS SO RAGGED AND DIRTY THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO DO SO HAD HE BEEN WELL
AND SHE ALMOST BEGAN TO FORGET HOW DULL SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE THEY CAME THEN ONE DAY AS SHE AND THE OTHER GIRL WERE PLAYING TOGETHER IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE THE LADY CAME TO THEM DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY AND KISSED THE PRINCESS TENDERLY SAYING
OR SHE WOULD DIE OF SHAME SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI
THE PRINCESS IS THE LOVELIEST LADY IN THE LAND AND THIS WAS TOLD TO THE QUEEN WHO HATED HER STEP DAUGHTER STILL MORE BECAUSE HER OWN DAUGHTER WAS UGLY AND STUPID
BUT JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW HIS PROPOSAL THE ARAB WHISPERED FEAR NOTHING BUT TAKE HER THE LUCK MUST CHANGE SOME TIME HE SAID AT LAST
AND THEN THE BOY LIFTED IT FROM THE POT AND PLACED IT ON A STONE WHILE HE PUT OUT THE FIRE AT THAT MOMENT A HAND WAS STRETCHED FROM A GRAVE AND A VOICE SAID
BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
OR I CANNOT ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I WILL BE ABSOLUTELY OBEDIENT ANSWERED THE TURTLE NOT ONLY ON THIS OCCASION BUT DURING ALL MY LIFE AND ONCE MORE I PROMISE FAITHFULLY NOT TO MOVE HEAD OR FOOT
AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
WHEN RUTH VISITED JULIA THE TWO USUALLY WENT TO A CONCERT ACCOMPANIED BY MISSUS BARLOW OR WHEN SHE COULD NOT GO BY ONE OF THEIR TEACHERS OF LATE JULIA HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF INVITING MISS SOUTH TO GO WITH THEM BRENDA NEVER WENT TO THESE CONCERTS
NORA REALIZED THAT SHE WAS FORTUNATE IN HAVING A MOTHER WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO ADVISE HER IN THE SMALL MATTERS THAT SEEM SO IMPORTANT TO SCHOOLGIRLS
OH I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT BRENDA ACKNOWLEDGED WITH A SIGH BUT I SHOULD BE EVER SO MUCH BETTER PLEASED WITH A HOTEL IT WOULD SEEM SO MUCH MORE AS IF WE WERE GROWN UP I HOPE THAT THIS WON'T SEEM LIKE A
AND LEAPING UP TOWARDS THE OLD LADY ALMOST KNOCKED HER OVER AT THE SAME MOMENT A PLAIN ELDERLY WOMAN ENTERED BEHIND FIDESSA AND JULIA COULD SEE AS SHE STOOD IN THE DOORWAY THAT HER EYES WERE RATHER RED AROUND THE EDGES AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WEEPING
EXCLAIMED EDITH ALMOST BREATHLESSLY
THAT ONLY SHOWS HE SAID HOW CLEVER THE MAN WAS WHO MADE THE REPAIRS BEFORE THEY TURNED FROM THE WINDOW HE MADE THEM NOTICE THE TALL FACTORY CHIMNEYS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WHICH HE CALLED HIS THERMOMETERS
OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
MISSUS BLAIR SENT THIS PAPER UP FROM THE LIBRARY TO CHEER YOU THERE WAS A LARGE PATCH OF BLUE IN THE WEST WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN
EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS DERISIVELY IN THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN SHE RESPONDED WITH A SMILE WHY HOW WELL THE ROOMS LOOK THERE WON'T BE A THING FOR THE BOYS TO DO THIS EVENING FOR PHILIP AND WILL HARDON
IT IS TRUE THAT THE VARIOUS MOTHERS OF THE GIRLS COMPRISING THE FOUR HAD SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER BECAUSE FOR A FORTNIGHT IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE GIRLS TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE YET EACH OF THESE MOTHERS
HOLDING UP A LARGE DOLL DRESSED IN THE LONG EMBROIDERED ROBES OF A BABY ALL THE GIRLS LAUGHED EXCEPT EDITH WHO SELDOM SAW THE FUNNY SIDE OF THINGS AS QUICKLY AS THE OTHERS WELL YOU CAN SEE YOURSELVES BOYS SHE SAID IN A DETERMINED TONE
HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LESSONS WHICH HER FATHER HAD BEEN MOST CAREFUL TO TEACH HER IT WAS THEREFORE NOT VERY OFTEN THAT SHE LET HER THOUGHTS DWELL TOO LONG ON HER OWN AFFAIRS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY SHE FELT A LITTLE LOW SPIRITED
SHE HAD BEGUN TO SAY LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE THEN SUDDENLY SHE GAVE A START SURELY SHE HAD SEEN THAT FACE BEFORE BUT WHERE
SAW A COMPENSATION FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS LAST WEEK OR TWO IN THE FACT THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD SHOWN MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN SHE HAD GIVEN HER CREDIT FOR MISSUS BARLOW WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE GOOD SPIRIT THAT HER NIECE JULIA HAD SHOWN
AND HALF MY CLOTHES ARE MADE IN THE HOUSE AND WE ALWAYS HAVE SUCH STUPID SEAMSTRESSES THAT I SHOULD SAY SO BELLE I DO THINK THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME OF THE UGLIEST CLOTHES LATELY THAT I HAVE SEEN THIS WINTER INTERRUPTED NORA RATHER UNCEREMONIOUSLY
THE POET OF COURSE DID NOT SPEAK TO JULIA IN PRECISELY THESE WORDS BUT THIS WAS THE DRIFT OF WHAT HE SAID AND IT WAS IN ABOUT THIS FORM THAT SHE REPEATED IT TO HER AUNT AND BRENDA AT THE LUNCHEON TABLE WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY
EDITH'S MOTHER HAD OFFERED THEM THE USE OF A LARGE DRAWING ROOM IN HER HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST ADAPTED TO AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND
THE LARGE ROOM WAS SO HANDSOME AS TO REQUIRE COMPARATIVELY LITTLE DECORATION THE LONG MIRRORS WITH WHICH EVERY SIDE WAS PANELED FORMED A COMPLETE DECORATION IN THEMSELVES AND ADDED TO THE GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS AS BRENDA SAID BY MAKING THE TABLES LOOK DOUBLE
FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
MISSUS BLAIR AND MISSUS BARLOW WERE ALSO READY TO ADVISE THEIR DAUGHTERS
WHERE DID YOU FIND MY POOR LITTLE DOG BY THIS TIME THE POOR LITTLE DOG WAS SEATED CALMLY ON A CUSHION WITH ITS SLENDER FRONT LEGS CROSSED AS IF IT HAD NEVER GIVEN ANY ONE A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS
HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
THEY WENT TO WORK WITH A WILL TO GATHER IN THE PROMISED CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE NATURALLY SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE THE FANCY ARTICLES BESTOWED UPON THEM WERE NUMEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL AND MANY WERE THE OHS AND AHS
AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
AS TO FRANCES THOSE WHO KNEW HER BEST REALIZED THAT HER FAMILY PRIDE HAD BEEN NURTURED AT HOME AND THAT HER UNFORTUNATE WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS WAS NOT WHOLLY HER OWN FAULT YET THAT NORA HAD BEEN ABLE TO INFLUENCE HER SOMEWHAT WAS PROVED BY A SLIGHT CHANGE IN FRANCES DEMEANOR TOWARDS OTHERS
BRENDA HAD NOT YET MADE UP HER MIND TO GIVE HER APPROVAL TO HER COUSIN'S STUDYING GREEK AND SHE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO CONTRADICT BELLE AND FRANCES POUNDER WHEN THEY SAID THAT IT MUST BE A VERY DISAGREEABLE THING TO HAVE A COUSIN WHO INTENDED TO BE A TEACHER
HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP
BELLE REDDENED VERY DEEPLY AT THIS SPEECH FOR AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WAS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT OF HER CLOTHES UNLIKE BRENDA OR EDITH SHE NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING TO A FINE COSTUMER
ALTHOUGH ALL THE OTHER GIRLS REALIZED THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE ROSAS CHRISTMAS TREE HAD BEEN LARGELY DUE TO HER
THE LATTER WAS EVEN KNOWN ONE DAY TO OFFER TO GO OUT TO RUTH ROBERTS HOUSE TO HELP HER FINISH A PIECE OF WORK FOR THE BAZAAR IN THOSE LAST DAYS TOO BEFORE THE EASTER VACATION THERE SEEMED TO BE AN UNUSUAL UNITY AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS
SANG NORA WHILE EDITH PATTED BRENDA ON THE BACK AND SAID WELL WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE WEATHER AND WE MIGHT AS WELL HOPE FOR THE BEST I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL COME EVEN IF IT RAINS
WHILE FIDESSA WAS RUNNING AHEAD THE MAN ASKING JULIA TO FOLLOW HIM HAD SHOWN HER INTO A LARGE ROOM RATHER DIMLY LIGHTED AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ALONE BUT FAR AT THE OTHER END OF THE APARTMENT
HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
REALLY NORA I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SPEAK IN THAT WAY TO BELLE
AS A MATTER OF FACT BELLE WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED AND SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE HAD STAYED MUCH LONGER WITH HER FRIENDS
SO WHEN JULIA ASKED HER ONE AFTERNOON IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO WITH HER TO CALL ON DOCTOR HOLMES SHE DECLINED WITH THANKS AND LEFT JULIA FREE TO INVITE EDITH
NOW LET ME SEE IF YOUR COLLAR TELLS WHO YOUR OWNER IS ADDED JULIA AND SHE BENT DOWN TOWARDS THE DOG THERE TO HER SURPRISE SHE READ IN CLEAR LETTERS FIDESSA MADAME DU LAUNY
SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
TAKING ITS EXERCISE IN FRONT OF THE GREAT MYSTERIOUS HOUSE JULIA HAD ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF DOGS AND THE LITTLE TREMBLING CREATURE APPEALED STRONGLY TO HER FOR A MOMENT SHE ALMOST WISHED THAT THERE WERE NO NAME ON THE COLLAR
AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
WITHOUT REALIZING IT SHE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE INTO THE PARK AND PAUSING TO ADMIRE A BIT OF DISTANT VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GET FROM A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED POINT SHE LINGERED A MOMENT OR TWO LONGER
RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
BELLE DISCREETLY SAID NOTHING FURTHER FOR SHE HAD LEARNED THAT WHEN NORA ASSUMED THIS POSITIVE TONE BRENDA WAS APT TO GO OVER ON HER SIDE AND THEN BELLE HERSELF WOULD BE SO IN THE MINORITY AS TO BE OBLIGED TO SEEM AN UNPOPULAR PERSON
AND ITS LAST DAYS OR HOURS GENERALLY SEEM TO MELT AWAY THUS WHEN THE FOUR REALIZED THAT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LAY BETWEEN A CERTAIN APRIL AFTERNOON WHEN THEY MET TO SEW AND THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THE OPENING OF THE BAZAAR THEY BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE NERVOUS
IF YOU MAKE ME BUY THIS DOLL OUT IT GOES TO A CERTAIN ROOM IN ONE OF THE COLLEGE BUILDINGS TO BECOME A CHERISHED DECORATION AND WAVING THE DOLL DRAMATICALLY IN THE AIR I SHALL DEFY ANY PROCTOR OR COLLEGE AUTHORITY TO TEAR IT AWAY FROM ME
FROM THE FOUR AND THEIR ASSISTANTS WHEN ON TUESDAY THEY FELL TO THE TASK OF OPENING THE PARCELS AND ARRANGING THEIR CONTENTS ON THE TABLES TUESDAY WAS RAINY AND AT DUSK GAVE LITTLE PROMISE OF A BRIGHT SKY FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
SAID MADAME DU LAUNY QUERULOUSLY WE ARE NOT AT A FUNERAL
YET ALMOST IN A SHORTER TIME THAN I HAVE TAKEN TO TELL IT SHE RECOGNIZED THE OWNER OF THE PAPERS HE WAS CERTAINLY NO OTHER THAN DOCTOR OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES THE FAMOUS AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE
WHERE THEY FOUND MISSUS BARLOW A VERY SYMPATHETIC LISTENER
FOR EDITH HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE HABIT OF FORGETTING JUST WHAT WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET AND THOUGH PHILIP HAD NO VERY DARK SECRETS THERE WERE STILL LITTLE THINGS THAT HE PREFERRED NOT TO HAVE TOLD
SHE NEVER ALLUDED TO A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AS MY FRIEND OR MY NEIGHBOR SHE SPOKE ONLY OF THINGS AND FOR THE MOST PART OF THINGS THAT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH NEW ENGLAND HER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL WERE EVIDENTLY PROMPTED BY POLITENESS
SHE REALLY DOES HAVE A HARD TIME AND IT ISN'T FAIR TO CRITICISE HER NO ADDED BRENDA IT IS NOT WELL BRENDA SAID NORA YOU OUGHT NOT TO SAY ANYTHING YOU MAKE BELLE AWFULLY MAD SOMETIMES BY WHAT YOU SAY I HEARD YOU TELLING HER THE OTHER DAY
I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF WE SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GIVE TO MISSUS ROSA DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS TOO SOON BRENDA SAID BELLE SUPPOSE IT SHOULD RAIN ON THE DAY OF THE SALE OR SUPPOSE OH
HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ME TOO
AS JULIA LOOKED AT THE LADY WHO HAD ADDRESSED HER SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS OR HAD BEEN TALL HER FIGURE THOUGH SOMEWHAT BENT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF STATELINESS THIS ASPECT WAS INCREASED BY THE LARGE TOWERING STRUCTURE WHICH SHE WORE ON HER HEAD
SHE ALTOGETHER FORGOT THE STRICT DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN REARED AND INSTEAD OF SITTING CALMLY ON HER CUSHION SHE JUMPED UP IN JULIA'S LAP AND FROM TIME TO TIME PLANTED A COLD MOIST LITTLE KISS ON HER CHEEK WHEN AT LAST JULIA ROSE TO GO
IT WAS A WINDY DAY IN EARLY JANUARY
HER AUNT HAD ASKED WITH GREAT INTEREST OH HE THANKED ME AGAIN FOR PICKING UP THE PAPERS COMPLIMENTED ME FOR BEING SO SURE FOOTED ON SUCH A SLIPPERY SIDEWALK
WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
BUT I MUST SAY THAT IT SEEMS MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT NO ONE SAW HER NEITHER THE COACHMAN THE FOOTMAN NOR JANE WHEN THE CARRIAGE STARTED HOME NONE OF THEM TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LOOK UNDER THE RUGS TO SEE IF SHE WAS THERE
AUNT SMILED AT THE EXPRESSION OF RELIEF ON HER NIECE'S FACE ON HEARING THIS
IT DEPENDS I SUPPOSE SAID EDITH SHYLY ON WHOSE WORK IT IS I AM AFRAID REPLIED THE POET THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE STANDARD FOR VERSE MAKERS
BUT SO DEFINITE HAD SHE BEEN IN EXPRESSING HER WISHES THAT THE GIRLS FELT THAT IT WAS DUE HER FOR LENDING HER HOUSE TO PAY ALL DEFERENCE TO WHAT SHE SAID ON THE MONDAY THEREFORE AFTER EASTER
FROM THE QUAINTEST OF OLD FASHIONED CHINA CUPS AND EATING SLICES OF THIN BREAD AND BUTTER AND CAKES THAT ALMOST MELTED IN HER MOUTH SHE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT HER FRIENDS AND HER COUSIN WOULD SAY TO SEE HER ACTUALLY SEATED IN THE HOUSE
OR NEAR THE FLOWER TABLE WHERE THEY WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE THE WORK DID NOT OF COURSE PROCEED VERY RAPIDLY FOR EVERY ONE IN THE GROUP OF FIFTEEN OR MORE HAD TO GIVE AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING AND A UNANIMOUS OPINION AS TO WHAT LOOKED BEST IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE WAS NATURALLY IMPOSSIBLE
HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
AND REFUSES TO BE CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT IN THAT CASE WHAT ARE WE TO DO CRIED TWO OR THREE OF THE BOYS IN CHORUS
YOU DON'T CALL THIS A FUSS REJOINED NORA ONLY A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING NOW IN SPITE OF HER OUTSPOKENNESS NORA WAS REALLY A VERY FAIR MINDED YOUNG PERSON OR PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY BECAUSE OF IT
I DO THINK NORA THAT YOU MIGHT BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY YOU KNOW THAT BELLE DRESSES AS WELL AS SHE CAN AND I THINK THAT SHE ALWAYS LOOKS WELL I WISH THAT I COULD TRIM HATS OH BRENDA IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU CAN'T FOR IF YOU COULD YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE A THING TO WEAR
HE TOLD ME TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THEM AS HE HAD NO COPY
AN ATTENTION THAT ANY ONE COULD SEE WAS NOT A MERE PRETENCE PHILIP BLAIR HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CONFIDE TO HER A LARGER SHARE OF HIS COLLEGE WOES
IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
EDITH GAVE JULIA A LITTLE NUDGE THEY WERE BOTH AT THE AGE WHEN THE POSSESSION OF AN AUTOGRAPH OF A FAMOUS MAN IS SOMETHING TO BE ARDENTLY DESIRED BUT NEITHER OF THEM HAD QUITE DARED TO ASK DOCTOR HOLMES FOR HIS
BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE CASES RATHER EXCEPTIONAL TO BE SURE IN WHICH NORA WAS DECIDEDLY IN THE WRONG BELLE THEREFORE COULD AFFORD TO BE MAGNANIMOUS
WHILE MADAME DU LAUNY WAS SPEAKING JULIA SAID TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY SORRY TO BRING ON HERSELF A SCOLDING FROM SO SHARP VOICED AN OLD LADY AND SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING SORRY FOR JANE EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER HAD PROBABLY BEEN CARELESS
THEN YOU ARE REALLY A PHILOSOPHER EDITH SAID MISS SOUTH SOME PERSONS TAKE ALMOST A LIFETIME TO LEARN THIS SIMPLE LESSON AND INDEED SOME PERSONS NEVER LEARN IT AT ALL
WHY EVEN I IN ALL MY YEARS OF RESIDENCE HERE HAVE NEVER HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE OLD LADY I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT SHE SHOULD LEAD SO SOLITARY A LIFE BUT IT'S HER OWN CHOICE
AND IT ISN'T EVEN ARTISTIC OR OH WELL NORA REPLIED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE DONE I KEEP IT TO WORK ON HERE BUT I HAVE FINISHED A SMALL SHAWL AT HOME AND A PAIR OF BABY'S SHOES
IN CONSEQUENCE AFTER HER MOTHER HAD PUT ON A HAT A SIMPLE TRIMMING SUCH AS SHE APPROVED HERSELF BELLE WOULD SPEND HER FIRST SPARE AFTERNOON IN RIPPING IT ALL OFF IN ORDER TO RETRIM IT INDEED SHE USUALLY SPENT NOT ONE AFTERNOON BUT SEVERAL IN THIS OPERATION
BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
THE UGLIEST SHE HAD SEEN SHE TOUCHED A TENDER CORD IN THE FIRST PLACE BELLE HAD HAD A STRONG DISLIKE FOR THE COAT AND HAT WHICH HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER HAD SELECTED FOR HER AND IN THE SECOND PLACE SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD IMPROVED THE APPEARANCE OF HER COSTUME AS A WHOLE
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE SAW THE LITTLE NUDGE OR PERHAPS HE READ THE EAGER EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES FOR ALMOST BEFORE THEY REALIZED IT HE HAD PLACED IN THE HAND OF EACH OF THEM A SMALL VOLUME IN A WHITE COVER AND BIDDING THEM OPEN THEIR BOOKS HE SAID WELL I MUST PUT SOMETHING ON
WITH A SMILE ABOUT THE VIRGINIA LADY OF WHOM I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY HER LITTLE NIECE WAS REMARKING WITH PRIDE THAT HER GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN THE SON OF A BARONET
AS THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR ADVANCED IT WAS VERY PLEASANT FOR JULIA TO FIND HERSELF COUNTED IN AMONG THE BAND OF WORKERS IT IS TRUE THAT SHE OFTEN HAD TO TAKE A SHARP WORD FROM BRENDA
NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU ATTACHED THE LEAST IMPORTANCE TO APPEARANCES BESIDES I THOUGHT THAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE EVERY ONE COMFORTABLE IN HER FEELINGS
SOMETIMES SHE FOUND IT VERY HARD NOT TO SAY A WORD WHEN SHE HEARD THE FOUR RUSHING UPSTAIRS ON THE AFTERNOONS OF THE CLUB MEETINGS STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM NO INVITATION HAD YET BEEN GIVEN HER TO ASSIST IN THE WORK FOR THE BAZAAR
BUT HAD COLLECTED MANY PRETTY AND EVEN VALUABLE ARTICLES FROM THEIR FRIENDS ALL THE SCHOOL GIRLS NEAR THE AGE OF THE FOUR WERE INVITED TO ASSIST AT THE TABLES THE FOUR RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ADDING TO THEIR NUMBER JULIA
IT IS NEVER THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO SETTLE DOWN TO WORK AFTER THE HOLIDAYS AND EVEN JULIA FOR A DAY OR TWO FOUND HERSELF A LITTLE DREAMY WITH HER THOUGHTS CONSTANTLY GOING BACK TO THE MANY PLEASANT THINGS OF THAT CHRISTMAS WEEK
WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
RESPONDED HER MOTHER I DO WISH THAT YOU WOULD TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF YOUR OWN CITY HERE IS JULIA WHO HAS BEEN IN BOSTON BUT A SHORT TIME
BESIDES CAMBRIDGE WITH ITS SPIRES AND CHIMNEYS IN WINTER SAID DOCTOR HOLMES THERE IS NOT MUCH TO SEE BESIDES THE TUG BOATS AND THE GULLS BUT
OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
INDEED HE ANSWERED YOU SURPRISE ME
AND SHE WAS NOT HALF SO WELL INFORMED ON SPORTS AND GAMES AS WERE THE GIRLS WHO HAD LIVED ALL THEIR LIVES IN BOSTON BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO WHATEVER ANY BOY HAPPENED TO BE SAYING TO HER AND THE QUESTIONS THAT SHE ASKED ALWAYS SHOWED AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF ATTENTION
SHAPED LIKE A TINY SCIMITAR REALLY SHE THOUGHT I HAVE HAD A MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE BETTER THAN I DESERVE FOR IT WAS ONLY THIS AFTERNOON THAT I WAS FEELING SO CROSS AND SO DISHEARTENED BECAUSE THE FOUR WOULD NOT INCLUDE ME IN THE CLUB
HER FAMILY HAS HAD POSITION FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION BUT AMONG YOUR SCHOOLMATES AND HERS THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER GIRLS OF GOOD DESCENT WHO HAVE HAD ADVANTAGES HARDLY INFERIOR TO THOSE
I DID NOT MEAN TO STAY THE WHOLE AFTERNOON OH DON'T GO URGED EDITH IF YOU'LL WAIT HALF AN HOUR I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT I MUST FINISH THIS PIECE OF DRAWN WORK BUT BELLE CONTINUED TO PUT ON HER OUTER WRAPS
OH NONSENSE INTERPOSED NORA WITH A SMILE
PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT WITH HER FOR A DAY OR TWO WHILE FINDING THE OWNER O IF ONLY IT HAD NO OWNER WHAT JOY SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GAZED INTO ITS DARK EYES TO KEEP IT FOR MYSELF
THE FOOTMAN PLACED IN HER HAND A LITTLE BOX WITH MADAME DU LAUNY'S COMPLIMENTS HE SAID THIS WHEN SHE OPENED
YEARS AGO A MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY A MEMBER OF A GOOD OLD FAMILY AND SOMETIME AFTERWARDS A LADY WHO BORE THE SAME NAME THOUGH SHE WAS NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MURDERER WAS OUT SHOPPING IT SEEMED TO HER A CERTAIN CLERK WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFERENTIAL
ALTHOUGH VERY QUIET IN HIS WAY OF LIVING AND IN HIS GENERAL CONVERSATION HE HAD A LARGER INCOME THAN MANY IN HIS SET
THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
AND IF THERE WAS ONE THING IN THE WORLD THAT SHE DREADED IT WAS TO BE CONSIDERED UNPOPULAR SO TRIMMING HER SAILS SHE SAID WHY HOW SILLY YOU ARE NORA YOU KNOW THAT I WAS ONLY IN FUN
CANNOT DO THIS OR I CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE I AM A POUNDER MISSUS GOSTAR LAUGHED AT THIS SPEECH AND THE GESTURE AND TOSSING BACK OF THE HEAD WITH WHICH NORA EMPHASIZED IT FRANCES HARDLY SAYS THAT DOES SHE SHE ENQUIRED
BUT IF I HAD BEEN WITH THEM THIS AFTERNOON
INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
SAID MISSUS BARLOW I AM SURPRISED SURELY YOU REMEMBER HOW PLEASED YOU WERE WITH THE LAST LEAF
YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
TO WHOM THE REMARK HAPPENED TO BE MADE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ME READ SOMETHING
AND LOOKED UP IN JULIA'S FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONFIDENCE AND GRATITUDE COME I AM GOING TO PUT YOU DOWN ON THE GROUND FOR A MINUTE TO SEE WHETHER YOU ARE HURT OR ONLY PRETENDING SO SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD SHE STOOD THE LITTLE DOG ON ITS FEET
NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
NOW THE PLANS FOR THE BAZAAR HAD RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE OLDER PERSONS IN THE FAMILIES OF THE YOUNG WORKERS AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THEY HAD HAD FROM THEIR ELDERS WAS NOW THEIR CHIEF INCENTIVE
AS IF UNDERSTANDING HER PURPOSE THE LITTLE CREATURE LIMPED IN FRONT OF HER FOR A FEW STEPS BUT THE LIMP WAS SO SLIGHT AS TO ASSURE JULIA THAT NO SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAD BEFALLEN THE LEG WHICH THE DOG STILL SEEMED INCLINED TO HOLD OFF THE GROUND
DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
YOU ARE NOT GOING NOW CRIED BRENDA OH DON'T GO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT NORA ARE YOU OH NO ANSWERED BELLE WITH THE AIR OF INJURED INNOCENCE OH NO BUT I THINK THAT I OUGHT TO BE GOING
AND JAMES WHO KEPT HIS POST NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT ON MADAME DU LAUNY AND HER YOUNG GUEST IN ALL THEIR REMEMBRANCE AND BOTH HAD LIVED IN THE HOUSE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A YOUNG GIRL IN CONVERSATION WITH THEIR MISTRESS
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE US USE TOBACCO POUCHES THAN SMOKE THESE UNWHOLESOME CIGARETTES YOU SHOULDN'T USE TOBACCO AT ALL CRIED EDITH IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AT YOUR AGE PHILIP YOU KNOW HOW MAMMA FEELS ABOUT IT DON'T BE A GOOSE EDITH RETORTED PHILIP
AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
LET ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO MY LITTLE FIDESSA FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS LOSS FOR ME HAD SHE FALLEN INTO THE WRONG HANDS THEN WHEN SHE SAW JAMES RETURNING TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS READY SHE ADDED
A REGULAR RECEPTION BUT YOU KNOW I'M IN EARNEST ABOUT THAT PILLOW HE ADDED FOR HE KNEW AND RUTH KNEW THAT HE KNEW THAT THE DOWN PILLOW WITH ITS RICH CRIMSON COVER EMBROIDERED WITH A LARGE H WAS THE WORK OF HER SKILFUL FINGERS
IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
THE SURPRISE TABLE HAD BEEN AN IDEA OF BELLE'S AND WAS A RATHER AGREEABLE CHANGE FROM THE USUAL GRAB BAG ALL KINDS OF LITTLE THINGS TOYS NOVELTIES LIKE THOSE USED AS GERMAN FAVORS SMALL BOOKS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
SHE SAW A SLIGHT FIGURE ARISE FROM THE DEPTHS OF A LARGE ARMCHAIR AS THE MAN SAID SOLEMNLY MADAME DU LAUNY HERE IS A YOUNG LADY WHO HAS FOUND FIDESSA AT THAT MOMENT THE TRUANT DOG BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM
ANOTHER GUST AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COMPOSE A NEW POEM TO TAKE THE PLACE
AS A MATTER OF FACT THESE WERE SENT ME BY AN UNFLEDGED POET WHO WISHED ME TO TELL HIM WHETHER HE WOULD STAND A CHANCE
THE OLD TIMIDITY WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD BEEN THE TRIAL OF HER LIFE RETURNED TO HER NEVERTHELESS SHE RANG THE BELL BRAVELY AND WAS WELCOMED ALMOST WITH OPEN ARMS BY THE SERIOUS FACED SERVANT WHO OPENED THE DOOR HE HAD SEEN FIDESSA INSTANTLY
JULIA WOULD GO TO ROXBURY TO SPEND THE HALF DAY WITH RUTH AND ON OTHER SATURDAYS RUTH WOULD COME IN TOWN TO STAY WITH JULIA IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHICH WAS THE PLEASANTER THING TO DO AT ROXBURY THERE WERE RUTH'S PONIES TO DRIVE
IN ANSWER TO MADAME DU LAUNY'S QUESTION JULIA DESCRIBED FINDING THE LITTLE DOG IN THE PARK AND HER FEAR AT FIRST LEST IT HAD HURT ITS LEG THAT IS AN OLD TRICK OF FIDESSA SAID HER MISTRESS SMILING
AS HE HANDED THEM THE BOOKS HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WITH A WORD OR TWO MORE OF HALF BANTERING THANKS TO JULIA FOR HER ASSISTANCE ON THAT WINDY DAY HE BOWED THEM DOWN THE STAIRS SO IMPRESSED WERE THEY BY THE VISIT THAT THEY HAD LITTLE TO SAY UNTIL THEY REACHED HOME
AND IN SNOWY WEATHER A CHANCE TO COAST DOWN A QUIET SIDE STREET OUT OF TOWN THERE ARE MANY MORE CHANCES FOR FUN FOR GIRLS PAST SIXTEEN THAN CAN POSSIBLY BE FOUND IN TOWN OR THE CITY
SHE COULD NOT INDULGE HERSELF HALF AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED ON THIS PARTICULAR AFTERNOON JULIA FELT ESPECIALLY LONELY DOUBTLESS NO SMALL PART OF HER LONELINESS CAME FROM THE FACT THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE FOUR IN THE HOUSE
COULD SEE ANYTHING TO CRITICISE IN HER DRESS
RUTH AND WILL HAD MET SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE BALL GAME AND ALTHOUGH THE FOUR HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED IT THESE TWO YOUNG PERSONS HAD BEGUN TO TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN EACH OTHER YOU WOULDN'T PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT QUERIED RUTH
WHY SEE HERE BELLE HAS LEFT HER CENTREPIECE BEHIND HER OH GIVE IT TO ME CRIED BRENDA I WILL PUT IT AWAY AND SHE TOOK IT FROM NORA'S HANDS
NOW IMMEDIATELY JULIA DECIDED THAT THE OWNER OF THE DOG MUST BE THE MISTRESS OF THE LARGE HOUSE NEAR THE SCHOOL ABOUT WHICH HER FRIENDS WERE SO CURIOUS IN AN INSTANT TOO SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD SEEN THIS LITTLE ANIMAL OR ONE VERY LIKE IT
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THIS A PROCEEDING WHICH THIS TIME DID NOT ANNOY BRENDA MISSUS BARLOW ADMIRED THE LITTLE BOOKS
CLOTHES AND SOMETIMES SHE DOES LOOK SO QUEER BUT YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO TO HER FACE BETTER TO HER FACE THAN BEHIND HER BACK I DON'T KNOW REJOINED EDITH
THAT ENCOURAGES OLD LADIES TO BUY TOBACCO POUCHES THEY'RE MORE HARMLESS FOR OLD LADIES THAN FOR HARVARD UNDERGRADUATES SAID ANOTHER OF THE GIRLS SERIOUSLY WHEREAT TWO OR THREE OF THE BOYS PULLED CIGARETTE CASES OUT OF THEIR POCKETS AND SAID
THEY BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE AND PROMISED MISSUS BLAIR WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY DROP IN SOME TIME ON WEDNESDAY DON'T FORGET YOUR PROMISE TO ME SAID WILL HARDON IN AN UNDERTONE AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH RUTH AND RUTH PROMISED NOT TO FORGET
AND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW IT IS SURE TO FIT THOUGH EDITH MAY NOT HAVE GRASPED THE FULL FORCE OF THE POET'S MEANING
TO WHOM BRENDA HAD BEEN TALKING FOR MY OWN PART I AM NEVER SURPRISED OR DISAPPOINTED ABOUT ANYTHING FOR I NEVER EXPECT TOO MUCH BEFOREHAND
WE KNOW SEVERAL CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH IT AT CHRISTMAS NO THANK YOU SISTER EDITH RESPONDED PHILIP I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND MY HARD EARNED ALLOWANCE IN PRESENTS FOR CHILDREN
INDEED THEY HAD SEEN VERY FEW GUESTS IN THAT GLOOMY OLD DRAWING ROOM AND CERTAINLY THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY ONE ELSE TO BE ASKED TO DRINK TEA IT WAS AS PLEASANT AS IT WAS NOVEL TO MADAME DU LAUNY TO HAVE JULIA SITTING WITH HER AND AS FOR FIDESSA
IF YOU ONLY MAKE UP YOUR MINDS TO IT PERHAPS YOU'LL WANT ME TO BUY A BLUE SOFA PILLOW OR SOME OTHER YALE THING SIGHED WILL HARDON PERHAPS I SHALL BE DRIVEN TO TAKE THIS MOANED PHILIP
YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
YOU KNOW THAT EDITH ALWAYS HAD HER BIRTHDAY PARTIES IN THAT ROOM
NOW A GENERAL QUARREL WAS A THING TO BE DREADED AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO RISK IT BELLE WAS CERTAINLY A SENSIBLE GIRL AND WHAT SHE NOW DID WAS REALLY THE BEST THING UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEFT TO THEMSELVES
SEVERAL OF WHOSE POEMS SHE KNEW ALMOST BY HEART ALL HER OLD SHYNESS CAME BACK TO HER SHE DID NOT EXACTLY DARE TO SAY THAT SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
OR THREE CENTREPIECES FOR THE BAZAAR BUT I AM ALWAYS SO BUSY AT THIS SEASON YOU BUSY BELLE CRIED NORA WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING YOU ARE JUST THE IDLEST PERSON I KNOW INDEED I AM NOT
WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SAID NORA AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALL COME BACK AND BUY EVERYTHING THAT IS LEFT OVER BY TO MORROW EVENING CAN'T WE HAVE FIRST CHOICE OF ANYTHING QUERIED TOM HURST A MISCHIEF LOVING FRIEND OF PHILIP'S WHOM SOME OF THE GIRLS DISTRUSTED A LITTLE
AND BESIDES IT WOULD BE WORTH MUCH MORE TO ME THIS WAS NOT ENTIRELY AN IDLE BOAST THIS READINESS TO SPEND A LARGE SUM OF MONEY FOR A SMALL THING ON THE PART OF WILL
THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE GLAD TO BUY WHATEVER IS LEFT OVER FOR YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET IN UNTIL TOWARD EVENING YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOME ONE TO GIVE THE THINGS TO THAT YOU BUY THIS DOLL ASKED PHILIP HOLDING IT RATHER CLUMSILY ON HIS ARM WHY OF COURSE SAID EDITH
SHE ASKED EVERY MAIL HE ANSWERED BRINGS ME LETTERS FROM STRANGERS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE SOME CONTAIN POEMS IN MY HONOR AS SPECIMENS OF WHAT THE POET CAN DO
AND TAKING A VOLUME FROM THE TABLE HE BEGAN IN A VOICE THAT WAS A TRIFLE HUSKY THOUGH FULL OF EXPRESSION
THEN I HOPE HE MAY GET IT MURMURED WILL HARDON TO RUTH ROBERTS I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT WOULD AMUSE THE FELLOWS MORE
WHEN BOTH GIRLS ADMITTED THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SCAR
I AM SURE THAT WE HAD ALL THE TIME WE WISHED
THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING JULIA'S PECULIARITIES OTHER PERSONS DID NOT FIND JULIA PECULIAR TO OLDER PEOPLE SHE SEEMED AN ESPECIALLY WELL MANNERED GIRL WITH A DELIGHTFUL VEIN OF THOUGHTFULNESS THAT WAS NOT TOO OFTEN MET IN YOUNG GIRLS
BUT NOW WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF MANNER MADAME DU LAUNY TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG GIRL THERE IS NO REASON HOWEVER WHY YOU SHOULD SUFFER FOR JANE'S MISDEEDS
BELLE HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR WHATEVER KIND OF HATS SHE LIKES OH EDITH RESPONDED NORA YOU ARE ALTOGETHER TOO FAIR I AM TIRED OF HAVING BELLE FIND FAULT WITH EVERY ONE ELSE AS IF SHE WERE JUST PERFECT HERSELF FOR MY OWN PART I
THAT IS A GOOD OLD BOSTON NAME AND IF I MISTAKE NOT I USED TO KNOW YOUR GRANDFATHER AND THEN WHEN EDITH HAD SATISFIED HIM ON THIS POINT HE TURNED TO JULIA AND IN A BANTERING WAY SPOKE OF THE SERVICE SHE HAD DONE HIM THAT WINDY DAY
AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
HARDLY WORTH NOTICING WHEN FANNED BY BELLE AND FRANCES TOOK ON THE ASPECT OF JEALOUSY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING JULIA HAD BEEN MADE AT TIMES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
BRENDA AND BELLE WISHED A SMALL ORCHESTRA ENGAGED TO PLAY DURING THE EVENING OF THE BAZAAR AND FURNISH MUSIC FOR DANCING AT THE CLOSE OF THE SALE EDITH AND NORA WERE AFRAID THAT THIS WOULD EAT UP TOO MUCH OF THEIR PROFITS BUT BRENDA WAS VERY DECIDED IN HER VIEWS
YET DURING THEIR CALL HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAD TO SEE AND TO REMEMBER HE LET EACH OF THEM HOLD FOR A MOMENT THE GOLD PEN WITH WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN ELSIE VENNER AND THE AUTOCRAT PAPERS
ANSWERED BRENDA MISTER BARLOW LAUGHED I AM AFRAID THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT A VERY STRONG CASE OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHILDREN OH WELL INTERPOSED MISSUS BARLOW
WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
IN A MOMENT THE MAID HAD RETURNED AND ASKED THEM TO FOLLOW HER AT THE HEAD OF THE BROAD STAIRS THEY SAW THE POET HIMSELF STANDING TO MEET THEM WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND WHEN JULIA MENTIONED EDITH'S NAME AH
JUST QUANTITIES AND THEN THE REFRESHMENT TABLE AND
NOW LOOK AT THE PORTRAIT CLOSELY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT CHEEK
NOW RUTH WHILE PLEASED AT HIS WISH FOR THE CUSHION HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WOULD IF NECESSARY PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT IF YOU REALLY WISH TO HAVE IT I'LL TRY TO SECURE IT FOR YOU SHE SAID I AM SURE THERE WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE
EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT GOVERNORS OF MASSACHUSETTS NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS SPEECH WHEN QUOTED SOUNDS RATHER
UNLESS YOU WANT US TO STAY AWAY TO MORROW ANYWAY IT'S TIME WE STARTED FOR CAMBRIDGE WE'RE NOT USED TO LATE HOURS AT THIS THE REST OF THE BOYS LAUGHED RATHER MORE LOUDLY THAN THE OCCASION SEEMED TO WARRANT BUT WITH A RETURN OF GOOD MANNERS
WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
THAT REALLY ARE OF CONSEQUENCE
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE SMOKE CURLED UPWARDS HE WAS ABLE TO TELL HOW THE WIND BLEW AND DECIDE IN WHAT DIRECTION HE SHOULD WALK
THEY SAY SHE HAS A REGULAR HERMIT DISPOSITION HOW DID IT STRIKE YOU JULIA NOT THAT WAY UNCLE AT ALL NOT AT ALL THOUGH SHE SEEMED VERY SAD
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO AWFULLY THOUGHTLESS TOWARDS BELLE I DARE SAY THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY CORRECT RESPONDED NORA YOU USUALLY ARE EDITH BLAIR
DON'T LET US BICKER ANY ONE WOULD THINK THAT WE WERE ALL ENEMIES INSTEAD OF THE INSEPARABLE FOUR OH EDITH WE CAN'T ALL BE AS AMIABLE AS YOU RESPONDED NORA BUT REALLY I AM A LITTLE SORRY THAT I OFFENDED BELLE
AND EVEN VENTURED TO LAY OUT HER OWN POCKET MONEY IN LITTLE ORNAMENTS OR IN RIBBONS THAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD ADD TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE HAT IN THE SAME WAY SHE WAS ABLE TOO TO MAKE SLIGHT ALTERATIONS IN THE APPEARANCE OF HER GOWNS AND SOMETIMES THE CHANGES WERE IMPROVEMENTS
IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WRITER OF VERSE IS ALMOST IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO MAKES A MOLD FOR A PLASTER CAST OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
THE PUBLISHER QUOTES MERELY VERY CHARMING AND PRINTS THIS IN LARGE TYPE BOTH GIRLS SMILED AT THE EXPRESSION OF DROLL SORROW THAT CAME OVER THE POET'S FACE AS HE SPOKE AND I AM SO VERY UNFORTUNATE MYSELF HE ADDED
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ENQUIRED THE PRACTICAL NORA WE CAN'T MAKE MUCH OUT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SELL
YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
I AM GLAD MY FAMILY IS NOT SO ANXIOUS TO THRUST ME OFF AS MY FRIENDS ARE AND YOU ARE UNWILLING TO BE THRUST OFF AS YOU PUT IT MARRIED NO NOT UNWILLING UNPREPARED IT IS SO VERY FINAL YOU KNOW A WOMAN GIVES UP EVERYTHING
SO THAT HE ENTERED UPON THE RUTTY HIGHWAY BETWEEN DIRT SIDEWALKS WITH REGRET AS ONE WHOSE HOLIDAY WAS ENDING HE SCARCELY NOTICED THE LOITERERS WHO STARED AT HIM OR THOUGHT OF HIS STREAKED FACE HIS TROUSERS SPLIT AT THE KNEE HIS HAT LOST ON THE WILD RIDE
GOOD MORNING MISTER MAXINEFF SAID NOAKES TURNING SLOWLY THE RACKET SOME HALF BAKED FULMINATE I PUT IN THE DITCH OUT THERE AN HOUR AGO SO LONG SINCE SAID THE OLDER MAN ADVANCING TOWARD THE WINDOW
HE DROPPED HIS CIGAR WEARILY INTO THE SPITTOON BY HIS CHAIR IN THE CLUB CAR AND RELAPSED INTO LETHARGY WITH DULL ITERATION HE RAN OVER THE PLANS FOR THE DEAL IN PRAIRIE LAND THAT HE HOPED TO PUT THROUGH TO MORROW
AND A CURIOUS NEW SENSE OF THE BIGNESS OF THE EARTH OPPRESSED HIM HE FELT VERY SMALL AND VERY MEAN THE HUMILIATION OF HIS SPIRITS WAS A NOVEL FEELING AND AN UNPLEASANT ONE HE TRIED TO HUM IT AWAY
FILLED A SECOND CRUCIBLE WITH A HARMLESS HAPHAZARD MIXTURE AND PLACED IT OVER A DEAD FURNACE IN A STAND IN THE CORNER BEHIND THE DOOR HE LIFTED THE WINDOW SASH WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE HURLED HIS PRICELESS CRUCIBLE
HE WATCHED HER A MOMENT THEN STRODE RAPIDLY TO THE STAND LOOKING THROUGH THE FAINT HAZE HE SAW HER PASS DOWN THE STRAIGHT PATH WHICH LED TO THE GREAT GATE OF THE MAXINEFF WORK YARD WHEN SHE WAS CLOSE TO IT HE GRASPED THE SWITCH LEVER WITH CRAMPED FINGERS
AND HIS SOFT VIBRANT LAUGH HOW ARE YOU DEAR BETTER I HOPE HAVE YOU MISSED ME MISSED YOU AND THEN THE ENDEARMENTS THE CONFIDENCES THE HOPES AND FEARS THE PLANS FOR THE MORROW THE PLANS FOR ALL LIFE
SHE TURNED ON ARE YOU THERE THE FAMILIAR TONES REPEATED AND THEN THE REPLY YES WHO IS IT IN A WOMAN'S VOICE THEN HE SPOKE AGAIN ERNEST HE SAID IS IT HELEN AGAIN HER HAND PAUSED HELEN
FIXED UPON TWO MARGINAL ACCOUNTS JIM SMITH'S AND WALDRON'S IN EACH CASE THE COLLATERAL DEPOSITED HAD ALREADY BEEN INSUFFICIENT DRAWING OUT HIS NOTE BOOK HE SWIFTLY FIGURED THAT OLD GAMBLER SMITH'S ALWAYS ON THE EDGE HE REFLECTED
HE SNORED IN HIS BERTH WHILE THE TRAIN RAN OUT FARTHER AND FARTHER UPON THE GREAT KANSAS PLAIN SLEPT WHILE SIGNS OF CULTURE DISAPPEARED ONE BY ONE AND AROSE IN THE MIDST OF AN ENDLESS UNFAMILIAR WORLD OF GRASS
AND IN A PANIC MADDER THAN HIS RIDER'S BREAK INTO A RUN AND DASH UNRESTRAINABLY ONWARD CARGAN NUMB WITH FRIGHT LEANED OVER HIS NECK AND WOUND HIS HANDS IN THE MANE THE SPEED SICKENED HIM THE FLAT EARTH SWUNG BENEATH
HE DID NOT ACCORD TO HIMSELF THE GODLIKE PRIVILEGE OF CASTING DISCORD AMONG THE NATIONS AND HE DID NOT CARE WHAT PEACEFUL ZOO THE LION THE BEAR AND THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF EAGLE FOUND AS COMMON REFUGE ON THE OTHER HAND IF TO EACH IS GIVEN COEXTENSIVE POWER
HE HAD PERFECTED THE WORK OF A WEEK'S EXQUISITE DANGER HE HAD WON I AM GLAD GLAD HE SAID FAINTLY AS HE STRAIGHTENED UP HE FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY WEAK
HE'LL SHOOT HIMSELF I OUGHT TO DONE SOMETHING HE WHISPERED WITH A SUDDEN RUSH OF UNFAMILIAR EMOTION AND ALL THE SENTIMENT IN HIS NATURE HEAVED AND STRUGGLED TO THE LIGHT A COW LOWED SOMEWHERE BEYOND THEM
A NEW EXPLOSIVE SHE INTERRUPTED DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY WE MOTORED FROM STONEHAM I FIRST THOUGHT OF IT THEN I HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY TO WORK ON IT SO I TURNED THE IDEA OVER TO NOAKES AND I HAVE MADE APPLICATION TO A HOME FOR THE FEEBLE MINDED MISSUS MAX
GIMME A CIGAR HE CALLED TO THE BOY AT THE MAGAZINE COUNTER BIT OFF THE END LIT IT AND BEGAN TO THINK BUSINESS THE CLERK SWIRLING A CATARACT OF MILK FROM GLASS TO GLASS REVEALED THE INNER SHEET OF THE PAPER PROPPED BEFORE HIM
WHEN DRESSED HE SAT ON THE BED CHIN IN HIS PALMS AND LOOKED AT THE BLANK BEDROOM WALL A FROWN HUNG BETWEEN HIS BROWS LATER HE SAT BEFORE THE SHELVES IN HIS STUDY ABSENTLY SCANNING THE BACKS OF THE BOOKS WHEN WHEN HE SAID ALOUD
CARGAN TURNED FIRST AS USUAL TO THE STOCK MARKET REPORTS THERE WERE ONLY TWO ITEMS OF INTEREST SINCE HE HAD LEFT THE TAPE MONTANA PACIFIC HAD GONE OFF A LITTLE MORE
CARGAN SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS OF HIS APPEARANCE HIS SERGE SUIT HIS STRAW HAT HIS AWKWARD SEAT IN THE SADDLE THE LONELINESS OF THE PLAINS HAD SHAKEN HIS USUAL SELF ASSURANCE MAYBE THEY'LL THINK I STOLE THIS HORSE GUESS I'LL GO ROUND
PARTICULARLY ONE THAT WHICH WOULD BE CAPPED NEXT IN THE ORBIT OF THE LEVER HELD HIM FASCINATED THE WINKING POTENTIALITY OF IT THRALLED HIM AS THE TROUBLED CRYSTAL DEVOURS THE GAZE OF THE HINDU MAGI
IT WAS GOOD TO BE ALIVE HE THOUGHT FREE SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED WITH LEAVE TO TELL A GIRL
HE HELD A STEADY HAND ON THE LEVER SO THAT HE MIGHT PUSH IT BACK INSTANTLY IF HE SAW IN THE CRUCIBLE TOO SUDDEN A TRANSFORMATION AS HE WATCHED THE DULL SAFFRON POWDER TOOK ON A DEEPER HUE ABOUT THE EDGE THE BODY OF IT REMAINING UNCHANGED
CARGAN SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS SADDLE AND TRIED TO THINK OF BUSINESS BUT INSTEAD OF BUSINESS QUEER CHILDISH IDEAS BEGAN FLOATING IN AND OUT OF HIS MIND ACCOMPANIED BY WORDS REMEMBERED FROM SUNDAYS IN HIS BOYHOOD HE WAS ALONE WITH GOD
AND YOU ARE SORRY YOU HAVE BEEN SO EASILY INFLUENCED NOAKES ASKED IN PONDEROUS AGGRIEVEMENT YOU DO NOT SEEM TO BE OVERJOYED I AM HE SAID GENTLY DON'T BE HILARIOUS OVER IT I WILL I WISH
AND OF HIS FATHER THE GOVERNOR AND OF THE FAMILY PRIDE SUDDEN POVERTY WAS AS BAD AS DISGRACE I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY HE ANSWERED HURRIEDLY I'M IN TEMPORARY DIFFICULTIES MY HOUSE IS MORTGAGED I'VE BORROWED MONEY FROM MY WIFE AND OTHER PLACES
WHAT'LL I DO CARGAN THEY TOLD ME I'D FIND YOU ON THE TRAIN AND I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOUR ADVICE CARGAN WAS RELIEVED SELL MISTER WALDRON HE ANSWERED EARNESTLY SELL RIGHT OFF THAT BROGAN CROWD'S RUNNIN THE COMPANY NOW
INJURED GRUESOMELY LIVING DEAD AGAIN THE BLINKING SWITCH CAUGHT HIM BUT HE SHRUGGED AWAY ITS EVIL SUGGESTIVENESS HE SOUGHT TO FLEE THE STRAIN OF THE MOMENT TO MAKE IT SEEM NATURAL AND LIKE THE SMALLER RISKS OF HIS DAILY OCCUPATION
NOAKES WAS GLAD THERE WAS TOO LITTLE OF IT TO CAUSE A SUSPICIOUS DEAL OF DAMAGE MAXINEFF LOOKED REFLECTIVELY ABOUT THE YARD WHILE NOAKES NERVOUSLY EYED HIS CHIEF'S EXPRESSIVE PROFILE HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE FINE GRAY HEAD OF THIS TALL STRAIGHT MAN
HE COULD NOT COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS FOR BUSINESS A CURIOUS SENSE OF WEAKENED IDENTITY PERPLEXED HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF DRIFTING PICTURES WALDRON'S FACE AMONG THEM THAT FACE LINGERED HE SAW HIM LOOKING VAGUELY OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW
SOON HE WAS DESCENDING THE VILLAGE STREET KEEPING PACE WITH HIS RAPID THOUGHTS FROM THE EXCHANGE HE DISPATCHED A MESSENGER TO THE HOUSE A HALF MILE AWAY HE DRESSED QUICKLY THE WHILE READING REPEATEDLY HIS FOREIGN LETTER
WELL HOW DID CORNISH BEHAVE ON YOUR WAY BACK QUITE AS WELL AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH US NOAKES HE LEANED FORWARD QUICKLY DO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE CALLED ME NOAKES IT SLIPPED MISSUS MAX SAYS IT YOU KNOW I AM WEAK ABOUT TAKING ON COLLOQUIALISMS
I'M SURE GLAD HE REPEATED MORE VIGOROUSLY CARRYIN HIM TO DAY WAS WHAT DID IT A VISION OF MISSUS WALDRON'S HAPPY FACE ROSE TO BLESS HIM THE EXHILARATION OF THE MORNING COURSED BACK INTO HIS HEART
HER YARD WAS A GNOMISH ALTERNATION OF UNSULLIED LIGHT AND ALLURING SHADE THE MOON UTILIZED IMPARTIALLY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FEATURES OF LANDSCAPE AS DETAIL FOR THE PICTURE OF GRAY BLACK AND SILVER NOAKES TRAVERSED LESS RAPIDLY THE CURVED DRIVEWAY
GOD SAW INTO HIS HEART A LITTLE NERVOUS SHIVER RAN OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CHECKED IT WITH A LAUGH THERE FOLLOWED A WAVE OF SUPERSTITIOUS EMOTION
OF SAVING MEN MAXINEFF CORRECTED WHILE HIS WIFE SMILED AS AT THE RECURRENCE OF A CUSTOMARY WITTICISM AND YOU GAVE THE ORDERS MAX YOU ARE TO BE BLAMED FOR THIS DISPLAY OF ENERGY DON'T SCOLD DEAR IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL THING
NOAKES LOOKED DOUBTFUL SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND TURNED AGAIN OH I ALMOST FORGOT HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU WHERE IT CAME IN THE MAXINEFFS MAIL THIS MORNING MISSUS MAX SUGGESTED MY BRINGING IT TO YOU
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS THAT'S THE THING FOR HIM TO REMEMBER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS IN SELF DEFENSE HE BEGAN TO CALCULATE WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE COST TO CARRY THE ACCOUNT UNTIL THE APPALLING MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK SHUT OFF THE DISCUSSION
THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GALLING AND THE MADNESS OF GRATIFICATION CONSUMED HIS STRENGTH HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR STEPPING VERY GENTLY FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW SLIGHT A VIBRATION MIGHT SHATTER THE DELICATE AFFINITY IN HIS DISCOVERY
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED AFRESH BY THE FORCEFUL EXTERIOR SIGNIFICANT OF THE INNER ATTITUDE WHICH HAD WON FOR HENRY MAXINEFF A NAME HONORED AMONG NATIONS WHAT OF YOUR WORK HE SAID NOAKES WAS GLAD THOSE SEEING EYES WERE NOT ON HIM
IT WAS TO MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT HE HAD RALLIED WONDERFULLY AT THE END AND WAS CONFIDENT OF RECOVERY
TO NIGHT I KNOW IT MY DARLING NO AND THEN SILENCE COMPLETE TERRIFYING SHE HAD RUNG UP WITHOUT EFFECT HE HAD FAINTED SHE THOUGHT AND HAD DROPPED THE RECEIVER SHE WAS IN A FEVER OF AGONY
FIVE O'CLOCK HAD PASSED WHEN THEY EMERGED UPON THE NEW ENGLAND TOWN'S STOLID MAIN STREET THEY WALKED BENEATH THE VENERABLE FLANKING TREES TOWARD THE MAXINEFF VILLA WHICH SURMOUNTED A WOODED CONTINUATION OF THE STREET
HE GULPED DOWN THE SUDDEN REVERSAL AND FELT FOR WORDS SAY TELL HIM HE LICKED HIS LIPS
NOT A FORTUNATE ACCIDENT LIKE THAT OF THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED NITRO WITH GREAT DANGER TO HIMSELF HE HAD FOLLOWED A LINE OF REASONING TO ITS PROXIMATE END THE RESULTING DISCOVERY HE WOULD USE TO HIS INDIVIDUAL ADVANTAGE
WAIT UNTIL I'VE FINISHED AND GRANT ME THAT IT'S WORTH WHILE HE WHISPERED TO THE FACE AND HIS BREATH MADE LITTLE SWIRLS AND EDDIES IN THE HAZE ABOUT IT THE FILMY CURVES WAFTED TOWARD HIM BRINGING IT CLOSE TO HIS LIPS THE LIDS FLUTTERED
WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING OF GOOD BUSINESS ABOUT IT HE FELT BETTER AND BETTER FROM SOMEWHERE A SAYING FLOATED INTO HIS HEAD DOING GOOD UNTO OTHERS IS THE ONLY HAPPINESS BY HECK THAT'S TRUE HE COMMENTED ALOUD
THE WELL TRAINED HORSE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GRAZE HE TOO WAS QUIVERING WITH FATIGUE BUT HIS FRIGHT WAS OVER THE SUN WAS BURNING NEAR THE ZENITH THE WORLD AGAIN WAS EMPTY AND THIS TIME THERE WAS NO ROAD CARGAN WAS LOST
SAY YOU CARGAN CALLED CAN YOU GET AN AUTO ANYWHERE HERE
AND IN A CURIOUS EXALTATION OF MIND RODE ON DREAMILY HE NOTICED THE FLOWERS IN THE COARSE GRASS WATCHED THE WILD DOVES FLYING WITH THEIR QUICK STRONG WING BEATS
IN THE MIRROR OF THE SODA FOUNTAIN HE SAW HIMSELF TORN DIRTY SHRINKING AND THE SIGHT FILLED HIM WITH DISGUST AND ANGER HE FELT AS RIDICULOUS AS WHEN HE HAD COME OUT WITH A GLASS TOO MUCH FROM THE STONEHAM BAR AND TRIPPED OVER THE STEPS OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE
JUST IN FRONT A LITTLE CALF STUMBLED TO ITS FEET AND RAN TOWARD THEM MOOING PITEOUSLY IT TOO WAS LOST CARGAN STROKED ITS NOSTRILS AND A SYMPATHY FOR ALL SUFFERING THINGS FLOWED THROUGH HIS HEART
WHAT ARE THE IDEAS NOAKES HESITATED AND SHE LAUGHED MERRILY AS SHE WENT TOWARD THE DOOR WE LAITY ARE HOPELESS AREN'T WE YOU ARE THINKING THAT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND NO I WASN'T BECAUSE I SCARCELY UNDERSTAND MYSELF
HUMMED THE BRAKEMAN AND SLAMMED DOWN THE SWINGING FLOOR OF THE VESTIBULE CARGAN WAS ALREADY BALANCING HIMSELF ALONG THE CORRIDOR OF THE CLUB CAR A LURCH OF THE TRAIN SWUNG HIM HEAVILY OUT AMONG THE CHAIRS TO SAVE HIMSELF HE CAUGHT A SHOULDER AND DROPPED INTO A SEAT
HIS EYE FELL ON A TALL AND STOOPING GENTLEMAN WITH A TRIMMED BEARD AND EYEGLASSES WHO WAS SEARCHING WITH WEARY EYES THE TRAIN WINDOWS BUT EVEN WHILE HE FROWNED AT THE RECOGNITION HIS WIFE HAD SEIZED HIM BY THE SHOULDER CAROLING
THIS REALLY EXISTS SHE FORCED HERSELF TO ASK ACTUALLY SAID THE ENGINEER BUT WHEN I LEFT HOME THE INVENTOR WAS IN A DIFFICULTY ALL THE MESSAGES WERE COMING OUT ALL RIGHT BUT BACKWARDS
SPLINTERED WOOD METAL HURTLING THROUGH AIR BLEEDING HANDS LACERATED BREASTS SIGHTLESS EYES THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES HE HALF GROANED HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE STAND AND WENT TO THE SINGLE WINDOW THAT LIT THE ROOM
AB SO LUTE LY YOU CANNOT SELL ME OUT HE BOWED AND FELT HIS WAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR I CAN'T CAN'T I CARGAN FLUNG AFTER HIM
YOU ALCHEMISTS ARE CAPABLE OF THE UTTEREST ABSTRACTION AREN'T YOU WHY HAVE YOU COME HE SAID QUICKLY FROWNING AT HER TO TAKE YOU DRIVING WITH AN ENTICING SMILE WILL YOU NOT GO PLEASE AT ONCE
NOT NECESSARILY OH YES SHE DOES FREEDOM FAMILY ASSOCIATIONS AND IN RETURN
THE OLD MAN BLINKED RAPIDLY THEN CONQUERED HIS PRIDE WITH PUNCTILIOUS CARE HE UNBUTTONED HIS GRAY CUTAWAY TOOK OUT A WALLET FROM UNDER THE BUTTON OF THE SOCIETY OF COLONIAL WARS DREW FORTH A SHEET OF NOTE PAPER AND WITH A PENCIL INSCRIBED A BROAD O
THE SILENCE FLOWED OVER HIM AS A STREAM THAT HAD BEEN HELD BACK THE SKY WAS ENORMOUS HE WAS ONLY A SPECK ON THE VAST FLOOR AS HE PLODDED ON AND ON AND ON THROUGH THE DUST HE BEGAN TO GROW DIZZY FROM THE GLARE AND THE HEAT
HE SLID OFF HIS PONY AND LED HIM NEARER THE DITCH
I'M SURE GLAD THE WIRES ROARED AGAIN AND CARGAN PUTTING DOWN THE RECEIVER GRINNED SHAMEFACEDLY INTO THE DIRTY MIRROR BUT GRADUALLY A SENSE OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE BEGAN TO TRICKLE PLEASANTLY THROUGH HIS VEINS
HIS HORSE PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND THE CALF AMBLED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND CARGAN LIMPED AFTER HURRIEDLY LEADING HIS HORSE A HUNDRED YARDS BROUGHT THEM TO THE EDGE OF A SLIGHT BOWL IN THE PLAINS WITH A LITTLE MOISTURE AROUND WHICH PEWEES WERE FLYING
THIS SHE COULD NEITHER UNDERSTAND NOR FORGIVE RELIGIOUS SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE ORDINARY SENSE ALTHOUGH SUCH RELIGION AS MUST SWAY A TRUE IDEALISTIC LOVER WAS HERS BUT NOW
THROUGH IT HE SAW SHOPS STORE HOUSES AND SMALL BUILDINGS SIMILAR TO HIS OWN ALL A PART OF THE PLANT OF MAXINEFF
THE TRAIN STOPPED QUICKLY AND FIRMLY AND LAY DEAD UPON THE PRAIRIE ECCENTRICS OR HOT BOX SAID THE MAN WHO JUMPED OFF THE STEP BESIDE HIM NOTHING MUCH ELSE GOES WRONG WITH AN ENGINE NOWADAYS WHAT IS IT BILL
SHE HAD LEARNED NOW WHEN NOT TO LISTEN SHE HAD TIMED THE REPRODUCTION ABSOLUTELY AND WATCH IN HAND SHE WAITED UNTIL THE OTHER MESSAGES WERE DONE
A FEW MINUTES AGO SHE HAD HELD IT IN HER TREMBLING FINGERS AND PLACED IT IN THE MACHINE NOW
TWO BOYS WERE TEASING EACH OTHER ABOUT A GIRL A GROUP OF MEN WERE TALKING AUCTIONS OPTIONS PRICES REAL ESTATE HE DRANK THEIR TALK IN GREEDILY WITH A PANG OF HOMESICKNESS AND A RUSH OF RETURNING COMMON SENSE DISMOUNTING STIFFLY
HE WOULD INCREASE THE CURRENT THE THOUGHT BURNED BEFORE HIM LIKE A LIVE THING AND IN THE LIGHT OF IT HE SAW MANY PICTURES HELIOGRAPHS OF HAPPENINGS IN AND ABOUT THE LABORATORIES FLAME SMOKE DENSE AND TURGID
MAXINEFF HIMSELF COULD NOT BE SURE OF THIS NEW MIXTURE A RUN OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE MIGHT BRING ABOUT THE CHANGE HE LOOKED FOR AS READILY AS AN INCREASE THE SUSPENSE WAS UNBEARABLE WELL CAGLIOSTRO SHE CALLED
FREQUENTLY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN ACQUIESCENCE AND OCCASIONALLY INTERJECTED A PERTINENT QUESTION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HIS SECONDARY MIND BUT HIS THOUGHTS MOVED IN A CIRCLE OF SMALLER RADIUS WHAT TO HIM WAS A POLICY OF WORLD PEACE
AND SPREAD AND SPREAD HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE CLOCK OVER THE CLERK'S HEAD AND SAW THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF PAST TWO WITH GUILTY DELIBERATION HE ROSE AND WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE TELEPHONE BOOTH KEEPING BACK FROM FULL CONSCIOUSNESS JUST WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO
WELL CERTAINLY NOAKES IT SHALL BE THANKS MISS BECK HAVEN'T YOU DONE ANYTHING BUT WORK THESE DAYS I HAVE THOUGHT MORE OR LESS STRANGE WHAT ABOUT YOU OF COURSE STEADY SPRING HAS PASSED
A SERVANT BROUGHT IN BUTTERED RUSKS AND SERVED THE MEN WITH TEA ORDERS FOR ORDERS DO YOU PERMIT CIRCLES ABOUT YOUR EYES AS DARK AS THEY THEMSELVES ARE THEN YOU ARE EASILY IMMOLATE OVER HIS CUP MAXINEFF SMILED ENCOURAGEMENT TO HIS WIFE
WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR I'M BLOWN TO PIECES I DROVE CORNISH THIS MORNING HE GOT BY EVERYTHING ON THE WAY HE ACTED LIKE A PREMIERE DANSEUSE WHEN I PASSED THE COOPER'S SHOP HIS JOY AT SEEING HER WAS DISCOUNTENANCED BY HIS FEAR FOR HER
HOW ALIKE THE CASES WERE THE DIFFERENCE LAY IN THE CRUCIBLE IF THE MIXTURE THERE WERE PROPERLY PREPARED ADDED HEAT WOULD METAMORPHOSE IT CALMLY FROM ITS PRESENT HARMLESSNESS INTO SOMETHING NEW WONDERFUL DEADLY
AND STILL MORE THE HUSH OF THAT ENORMOUS PLAIN THE SOLEMNITY OF THE GREAT AND SHINING SKY FILLED HIM WITH HIGH AND NOBLE THOUGHTS SAY IS HAMDEN NEAR HERE HE ASKED OF A SLIM WOMAN IN A GINGHAM DRESS WHO APPEARED AT THE DOOR
MONTANA PACIFIC'S OFF TWO POINTS MORE
TELL ME SOME MORE ABOUT YOUR INVENTIVE FRIEND IS HE WEALTHY INDEED NO SAID THE ENGINEER THAT IS HIS TROUBLE IF HE HAD MORE MONEY OR IF HE HAD SOME RICH BACKERS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM HE MIGHT DO WONDERS I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP HIM SHE SAID
AND CARRIED THE MACHINE TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND TENSE AND ALMOST TERRIBLE ANTICIPATION
THE ASSERTION IN HIS TONE WAS IRRITATING WHAT'S GOIN TO STOP US CARGAN ASKED COOLLY SHOVED HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND PUFFED CLOUDS FROM HIS CIGAR DIFFERENT WORLDS OF IMAGINATION REVOLVED IN THE TWO MEN'S MINDS
ONE EVENING SHE DINED OUT HER NEXT NEIGHBOR ON ONE SIDE WAS A YOUNG AMERICAN ENGINEER
WHAT'LL I DO WITH MY SUIT CASE GIMME IT TO TAKE FOR YOU I GUESS IT AIN'T WORTH MORE'N MY HORSE
HIS SUBCONSCIOUSNESS GRASPED THE FINANCIAL LEVEL OF HAMDEN ALTHOUGH HIS THOUGHTS WERE STILL IN THE WIDE SPACES OF THE PLAINS A BOY RAN OUT FROM THE SIDE WALK TO SELL HIM A PAPER HE STUCK IT IN HIS SIDE POCKET AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE A MAN OF THIS WORLD AGAIN
THE NEED FOR SUCH CONTRIVANCES WAS NOT ACUTE AND SO ON THE CONVERSATION THUS BEGUN REACHED AT LAST SPECIFIC INVENTIONS AND THE ENGINEER TOLD OF A REMARKABLE ONE WHICH HAD COME UNDER HIS NOTICE JUST BEFORE HE LEFT NEW YORK
RAGING AGAINST HIS SOFTNESS BACK THERE ON THE PLAINS WHICH SEEMED A HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE WORLD HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND COUGHED AND CHOKED OVER HIS SODA SOFT HEADED DONKEY THE REACTION WAS COMPLETE
THE SKY SWAM DIZZILY HE DARED NOT PULL ON THE REINS HE COULD ONLY HOLD ON GRIMLY AND SHUT HIS EYES ONCE HE SLIPPED AND SCREAMING SAW FOR AN INSTANT A BLUR OF GRASS BEFORE HE COULD PULL HIMSELF BACK TO SAFETY
THIS KIND OF WORK INTERESTS ME COULD YOU NOT CABLE HIM TO COME OVER AND BRING THE THING WITH HIM I WOULD GLADLY FINANCE HIM I WANT SOME SPORTING OUTLET LIKE THAT FOR MY MONEY CABLE YES CABLE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ONE DOES BY IMPULSE OR NOT AT ALL
WAS MISTER MAXINEFF AT HOME THIS MORNING HE ASKED QUIETLY NO I BELIEVE HE IS IN THE CITY OH HE BREATHED THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE SLIPPED THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKET WELL I CAN'T STAY ANY LONGER NOAKES PRESSED HER HAND
AFTER ALL THE BUSINESS I'VE GIVEN YOU CARGAN NODDED INCREDULITY HORROR RESOLVE PASSED OVER WALDRON'S FACE YOU CANNOT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID FIRMLY
IT WAS A CASE SAID THE ENGINEER OF SUPPLY FOLLOWING DEMAND ALL AMERICANS REQUIRED TIME AND LABOR SAVING APPLIANCES AND THEY OBTAINED THEM WHERE SERVANTS ABOUNDED AND THERE WAS NO SERVANT PROBLEM AS IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT
YOU ARE PRACTICAL MY FRIEND CONFESS NOW THERE IS A REASON FOR YOUR YOUR APPLICATION NOAKES'S ATTITUDE WAS UNCOMPROMISING HE PLACED HIS CUP ON THE TABLE BEFORE HE SPOKE THE REASON YOU ARE THINKING OF MISSUS MAX IS NOT FOR A POOR MAN
HIS HAND LEFT THE LEVER AS IF IT PRICKED HIM YOU AM I A WRAITH NOAKES LOOKED AT HER SILENTLY IN THE MOMENT'S ABSTRACTION HER PRESENCE SEEMED A MANIFESTATION OF SOME PSYCHIC CONDUCTION WHICH HE TRIED LAMELY TO UNDERSTAND
AND TO NIGHT I HEARD A QUEER THING ABOUT YOU WHAT SHE ASKED IN AN ENGAGING MANNER OF INVITATION TO CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE TO BE MARRIED I HAVE IT ON THE WORD OF MY LANDLADY I SO IT IS RUMORED IN THE VILLAGE
AND THE THOUGHT OF THEIR LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND THE KIDS PLAYING BEHIND HER WARMED HIS BLOOD I GOT RUN AWAY WITH ON THE PLAINS BUT I'M ALL RIGHT HER FRIGHTENED EJACULATION THRILLED HIM WITH LOVING PRIDE
HOW DISTINCTLY YOU SPEAK YES IT'S ME AND THE SOFT VIBRANT LAUGH
HE ASSUMED A TOTTERING BRAVADO AND AS HE PUT HIS HAND TO THE LEVER HE SMILED CROOKEDLY A LIGHT QUICK TREAD SOUNDED ON THE WALK OUTSIDE ON THE DOUBLE STEP AS THE KNOB TURNED A VOICE SAID
SHE MERELY INSTALLED HIS MEMORY IN THE PLACE OF HIS RICH PERSONALITY AND LOVED THAT HE ALMOST MORE THAN EVER WAS HER STANDARD WHAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED SHE DID WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DISLIKED SHE LEFT UNDONE
THEN SHOOK ITS DUSTY HEAD OR A TEAM IT SHOOK ITS HEAD AGAIN OR A HORSE CARGAN HESITATED HE HAD NEVER RIDDEN A HORSE A SUDDEN GLEAMING IDEA SHOT ACROSS THE MAN'S SOLEMN FEATURES
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THIS IS IT IS A MACHINE IN WHICH YOU INSERT A PORTION NO MATTER HOW SMALL OF A TELEPHONE WIRE AND BY TURNING A HANDLE YOU COMPEL THIS PIECE OF WIRE TO GIVE BACK EVERY MESSAGE THAT HAS EVER PASSED OVER IT SHE HELD HER HEART
HE KISSED HER ADMIRINGLY SAY MARTHA YOU LOOK GREAT HE CHUCKLED
THEN AN ACRID ODOR FILLED HIS THROAT AND NOSTRILS THE FACE VANISHED HE STARTED BACK DISTRAUGHT A RUSHING RECOLLECTION OF MAXINEFF'S TRAGEDIES CAME TO HIM MORE VIVID EVEN THAN THE FACE
IT WOULD BECOME IMBUED WITH MARVELOUS POSSIBILITY A THING FOR WHICH ROYAL MILITARY BUREAUS IMPERIAL NAVIES WOULD PAY A GREAT PRICE A TWIST OF THE LEVER WOULD DO IT YET HOW ALIKE AND EWELL WAS MAD
NOAKES TOOK THE LONG FOREIGN STAMPED ENVELOPE THE TYPED SUPERSCRIPTION WAS NONCOMMITTAL BUT AT THE BERLIN POSTMARK HIS EYES NARROWED AND THE KNUCKLES OF THE HAND BY HIS SIDE WHITENED HE DREW A QUICK BREATH AND LOOKED KEENLY AT THE GIRL
HER MANNER LOST SOMETHING OF ITS VERVE IT ISN'T SAFE YOU KNOW REALLY HE ADDED AND WON'T YOU COME I CANNOT NOT THIS MORNING WELL SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE SIGH AS SHE THRUST IN HER HAT PINS
TO WAKE TO WHAT TO SUCH AWAKENING AS THERE IS FOR THOSE WHO NEVER FORGET ANYTHING
THEY WERE RATTLING THROUGH COAL SHEDS AND GRAIN ELEVATORS AT THE EDGE OF A TOWN WALDRON GOT UP STIFFLY AND CAREFULLY BRUSHED THE CINDERS FROM HIS COAT THIS IS BLOOMFIELD I THINK HE SAID COLDLY I'M MEETING MY FAMILY HERE
AND THAT WAS THE WONDER THE AMAZEMENT THE HORROR
AHEAD WAS A GOAL TOWARD WHICH HE BORE WITH INCREASING LIGHTNESS OF HEART CLEARLY DEFINED DECISIONS UNREGRETTED FADED INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF ANTICIPATION HIS PACK OF PROBLEMS DROPPED FROM HIM ONE DAY MORE AND HE COULD SPEAK ONE EVENING OF COMPANIONABLE FRIENDSHIP
WITH SLOW FINGERS MOVING THE KETTLES GENTLY CARGAN AND CASEY WERE BUSY HE FUMED FOR AN INSTANT THEN GAVE HIS OWN HOME NUMBER IT'S JIM HE SAID AND HEARD HIS WIFE'S CAROL OF SURPRISE HE COULD SEE HER TIPTOEING AT THEIR TELEPHONE
IT WAS A SURE THING FOR THE MAN WITH THE MONEY THE LAST OF HIS FINE SENTIMENTS EVAPORATED EXCEPT FOR WALDRON HE COULD HAVE SCOOPED IT ALL IN BUT NOW FOUR HUNDRED WAS ALL HE DARED TOUCH AND PERHAPS NOT THAT
OF COURSE SOME SECRET FORMULA MISTER MAX HAS YOU ON INDEED NO HE SAID MISTER MAX KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT IS HE CONTINUED HURRIEDLY IT'S THE SORT OF THING AT ANY RATE I'LL SOON BE THROUGH
YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BELIEVE ME HE SAID THE THING SOUNDS INCREDIBLE BUT THEN WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED ONCE THAT THERE COULD BE A TELEGRAPH AND STILL LESS A TELEPHONE WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE CAMERA WOULD EVER BE ANYTHING BUT A DREAM
WELL IF YOU'LL MAKE IT FIVE PLUNKS AND GIVE ME YOUR TICKET YOU CAN TAKE THIS HORSE AN I'LL GO ROUND BY TRAIN SAY DO YOU WANT TO CARGAN WAS TEMPTED
CARGAN READ BENEATH HIS ARM THE FULL PAGE ADVERTISEMENT OF A LAND SALE THE LAND SALE HE HAD COME THROUGH ALL THIS TOMFOOLERY TO REACH HIS EYES BULGED AS HE SAW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THROW A THOUSAND ACRES ON THE MARKET GOOD GOSH HE GULPED INWARDLY WHAT A CHANCE
AS OTHERS SEE US SHE TURNED HER BACK WHILE SHE ARRANGED HER HAIR BEFORE THE MAKESHIFT MIRROR RELIEVED FROM HER DIRECT GAZE HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO THE STAND AND LOOKED INTO THE CRUCIBLE THERE WAS NO CHANGE HE HAD EXPECTED NONE BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE
ONE OF THE BUILDINGS HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY HOSPITAL HE THOUGHT OF THE PITIFUL OCCUPANT HIS FACE SCARRED ONE SOCKET EYELESS AND SHIVERED IT ISN'T THAT I WANT TO HEDGE HE SAID I SHALL TAKE THE CHANCE
PLOVER SWUNG UP BEFORE HIM WITH MELANCHOLY CRIES A SOFT HAZE ROSE FROM THE PLAINS THEY GREW MORE VAST MORE ENDLESS
AND SAT SMOKING PEACEFULLY HIS MIND AGLOW WITH PLEASANT THOUGHTS THE BELL WHIRRED RAUCOUSLY HE SAW THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO REPLACE THE RECEIVER AND PUTTING IT TO HIS EAR CAUGHT CASEY'S VOICE AGAIN
HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE AND HOPED THAT HIS TELEGRAM WOULD BE TELEPHONED OVER TO THE RUNKLES SO THAT SHE MIGHT MEET HIM AT THE STATION WITH THE CLEAN SHIRT HE HAD ASKED FOR AFTERWARDS HE CUT HIS NAILS YAWNED LOUDLY AND WAS JUST GOING TO SLEEP WHEN THEY STOPPED AT JOLINE AND A BOY CAME IN WITH PAPERS
AND SPENT MY MORNING BLUNDERING OVER MAKING SOME I COULDN'T DO THAT EVEN FAMILIAR AS I AM WITH THE PROCESS WELL LEAVE IT ALL AND COME WITH ME OVER THE YARD I AM INSPECTING THIS MORNING BE MY SECRETARY FOR A WHILE
IN HIS ATTITUDE THERE WAS A RIGIDITY OF CONTROLLED EXCITEMENT OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE SEEMING HARMLESSNESS OF THE EXPERIMENT HE WAS AS A MAN ATTUNED TO A TREMENDOUS HAZARD ANTICIPATION AND MENTAL ENDURANCE TAUT
HE COULD DUPLICATE IT IN AN HOUR IF ONLY HE COULD REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT BEFORE TO NIGHT HE SAID AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A FIRM STEP HE DINED WELL THOUGH WITH FEW WORDS FOR THE KINDLY LADY IN WHOSE HOME HE LIVED
TO OTHER TALKS WITH OTHER FRIENDS AND NOW AND THEN WITH A TRADESMAN SHE HAD TO LISTEN BUT AT LAST CAME HER HOUR IS THAT YOU SHE HEARD HER OWN VOICE SAYING KNOWING IT WAS HER OWN RATHER BY INSTINCT THAN BY HEARING IS THAT YOU
SHE REMEMBERED NOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AWAY WHEN THE TELEPHONE WAS INSTALLED AND OTHERS HAD TALKED ON IT BEFORE HER IT COULD NOT BE HELPED
WE DON'T DO BUSINESS WITHOUT EITHER COLLATERAL OR CASH WALDRON THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS WALLET BACK HURRIEDLY AS IF SOME ONE HAD LAUGHED AT IT AND CAST A QUICK HURT LOOK AT HIS BROKER YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THINKING OF SELLING ME OUT
HER FACE WAS TROUBLED AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE MOTOR SHE CAUGHT HER HUSBAND'S ELBOW GENTLY AS IF TO ASK HIM SOMETHING BUT HE MERELY NODDED AND TURNED HER GLANCE TOWARD CARGAN'S WINDOW SHE BOWED AND SMILED VERY SWEETLY IN HIS DIRECTION
HE SAID ALOUD HE JERKED HIS STEED FROM THE ROAD INTO THE GRASS AND URGED HIM INTO A TROT INSTANTLY HE FOUND HIMSELF BEATEN AND JOLTED LIKE A SHIP IN A TEMPEST HE LOST A STIRRUP HE SLIPPED SIDEWISE ON THE SADDLE
FEARFULLY WONDERING AT THE STABILITY OF THIS NEW THING IT KEPT ITS EVEN COLORING HE PUSHED BACK THE LEVER WATCHED AGAIN AND WAITED HE WAS AFIRE WITH JOY HE HAD SUCCEEDED
AND THEN THE SPEED INCREASED THE SWEATY SHOULDERS LABORED BENEATH HIM AND HIS SENSES WHIRLED HE DID NOT NOTE HOW FAR THEY RAN BUT AT LAST CAME A SLOWER MOTION A GALLOP AND THEN A TROT
AND CARGAN SMILED SOURLY IN RETURN THEN THE CHILDREN HUSTLED THE OLD FOLKS INTO THE TONNEAU AND THEY WERE OFF JUST AS THE TRAIN STARTED CARGAN FELT HARDLY USED
THE BUTLER HERE WILL GET YOU A FORM
THERE MUST BE MANY CONVERSATIONS BEFORE SHE CAME TO HER OWN SHE WOULD HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL SHE TURNED ON AND THE LAUGHING CHAFFING CONVERSATION WITH THIS FOOLISH LITTLE HELEN PERSON REPEATED ITSELF OUT OF THE PAST NOW SO TRAGIC
AS SHE LISTENED THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE BUT STILL SHE TURNED ON AND ON SOMETIMES HE WAS SO HOPEFUL AND BRIGHT AND AGAIN SO DESPAIRING
BLAZING WITH MARBLE AND ONYX IN THE AFTERNOON SUN MADE CARGAN'S DRY THROAT WRINKLE WITH THIRST HE PULLED HIS HORSE TOWARD THAT SIDE OF THE STREET THERE WAS A ROW OF CUSTOMERS ALONG THE SODA WATER COUNTER AND THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS CAME SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION
I FORGOT TO HAVE LUNCHEON TO DAY AND YOUR TEA HAS GIVEN ME A KEEN ANTICIPATION FOR DINNER MY ZEST WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO YOU AND PAST MY CONTROL BESIDES I SHALL TAKE A HALF MILE WALK TO NIGHT LUCKY BECKY THEN COME AGAIN SOON MAX DEAR SHE SAID
AND HE WAS AFRAID OF HER HER INSINUATED TRUST IN HIM THREW INTO MURKY RELIEF THE AFFAIR WHICH OCCUPIED HIM WHEN SHE TURNED TO HIM A FLUSHED JOYFUL FACE AND GRAY EYES CLEAR AND UNSULLIED IT FLASHED INTO HIS SOUL
AND ALL THAT MADE FOR THE WORLD'S GOOD AND HAPPINESS SHOULD BE SO WANTONLY EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT NO TOUCH OF THE VANISHED HAND SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO THE ONE SOUL NOW LEFT BEHIND WITH WHOM HIS SOUL HAD BEEN FUSED
HE EXERTED EVERY POWER TO ATTAIN IT AND USED THE MEANS AT HIS DISPOSAL IF HE ENCOMPASSED IT HE PUT IT TO THE USE FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED HE GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE EXTRANEOUS INFLUENCE IT EXERTED ON OTHER PHASES UPON WHICH HIS LIFE TOUCHED HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY
IN THE NORTH A WHITE CLOUD MASS PILED ITSELF UP AND UP UNTIL IT SEEMED AS IF IT MIGHT TOPPLE OVER UPON THE FLAT WORLD BENEATH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE LOOKED AT THE COUNTRY EXCEPT AS REAL ESTATE NEVER SEEN THE PLAINS
HE THOUGHT AND REMEMBERED WITH A LITTLE ANGRY SATISFACTION ANITA WALDRON'S COMING OUT DANCE AND HOW THE RUNKLES WHO WERE INVITED KEPT TALKING ABOUT IT ALL WINTER OLD WALDRON WON'T BE SO DARN PARTICULAR NEXT YEAR
THERE WAS NO HOUSE IN SIGHT NO ROAD NOTHING BUT THE DEAD TRAIN THE NEW LAND OF ENDLESS SHIMMERING PRAIRIES AND BEYOND THE DITCH A SINGLE HORSEMAN LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE LONG CARS AND THE FACES STRAINED AGAINST THE GLASS OF THE WINDOWS
THEN IN A PANICKY FRIGHT HE BEGAN TO SHOUT AND SAW AT THE BIT FRIGHTENED BY THE VOICE AND THE THUNDER OF HOOFS A CHAPARRAL COCK DARTED FROM BENEATH THE HORSE'S NOSE IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BEAST SWERVE THEN TOSS HIS HEAD
SO TIRED SO OLD IT IS A BAD DAY EVERY ONE HAS BEEN COMPLAINING OF TIREDNESS TO DAY YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE KIND JUST TO COMFORT ME IT'S NO USE I CAN SEE SO CLEARLY SOMETIMES
HE CALLED CARGAN AND CASEY THEN WAITED FIDGETING SILENCE INVADED THE LITTLE KITCHEN THE CLOCK TICKED IN A HUSH THE CHICKENS DRONED IN WHISPERS THE WOMAN HERSELF WORKED OVER THE STOVE
HE SPOKE THE WORDS WITH SINGULAR FEELING TRULY THOUGH MISTER NOAKES SHE SAID IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER YOU ARE TOO BUSY MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE TO BREAK OUT BREAK OUT WITH THE MEASLES IF NOTHING ELSE WILL INTERRUPT YOU AND YOU ARE TO HAVE TEA WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON
TO ORTHODOXY SHE THREW OFF THE CREED OF HER PARENTS AS NATURALLY AND SIMPLY AS IF IT WERE A BORROWED GARMENT
EACH NEW EXPLOSIVE DEALS A BLOW AT WAR WAR NOAKES HAD HEARD THE SAME THING WHEN HIS CHIEF CONCLUDED WITH THE GOVERNMENT AN AGREEMENT WHICH SECURED TO IT THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF HIS LATEST PRODUCT
YES SHE CAME TO TELL ME THAT MISSUS MAX WILL PERMIT ME TO HAVE TEA WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON YOU ARE COMING I HOPE INDEED YES I CONFESS I AM TIRED OUT I GAVE UP THE EXPERIMENT EARLY THIS MORNING I UNDERSTOOD THE FULMINATE WAS RUNNING LOW
A LOW WAVE OF THE PRAIRIES HAD HIDDEN FROM HIM A LITTLE HOUSE AND BARN STANDING CRUDELY NEW AGAINST THE SKY IN THE DISTANCE TINY FIGURES WERE MOVING BEHIND THE BUILDINGS AND A DUST CLOUD ROSE FROM THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT
MISSUS MAXINEFF LIFTED HER SHOULDERS AND DISPLAYED HER PALMS IN A MANNER THAT MARKED HER NATIONALITY SO SCIENCE HAS MADE YOUR DARK SKIN WHITE LOVE FOR THIS BUSINESS OF KILLING MEN HAS KEPT YOU HID A WEEK
AND ON SHE SAT THERE FOR HOURS BEFORE THE LAST WORDS CAME
MISTER CARGAN THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS ABOVE BUSINESS HIS VOICE FAILED A LITTLE THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH CARGAN HAD HEARD THAT BLUFF BEFORE
HE TOOK THE PATH BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHICH LED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE MAXINEFF PLACE HE LIT HIS FIRST PIPE SINCE MORNING HOW GOOD LIFE WAS THE TOWN THE PLANT MAXINEFF WERE ALL BEHIND HIM
WE CAN HOLD HIM A LITTLE LONGER GOTTA SELL WALDRON OUT MUST HAVE MADE A THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT FIRST AND LAST TOO BAD A MOMENTARY SENSE OF WALDRON'S CALAMITY SWEPT OVER HIM BUT QUICKLY EVAPORATED BUSINESS IS BUSINESS
HE HAD INSISTED ON IT THE DRESS SHE WAS TO WEAR ON HIS FIRST OUTING AT ELEVEN HE HAD SAID MIND YOU DON'T FORGET BUT THEN YOU NEVER FORGET ANYTHING GOOD NIGHT ONCE MORE MY SWEET GOOD NIGHT
SHE NODDED AND SAY CAN I USE YOUR TELEPHONE SHE HESITATED LOOKING HIM OVER THEN MOTIONED HIM INCURIOUSLY TO THE STOOL BEHIND THE PINE TABLE SOLITUDE SEEMED TO HAVE MADE HER UNREADY OF SPEECH
YES SIR I THINK THE JARRING OF THE WAGON YOU SEE LEAVING THE CHEMICAL HOUSE CAUSED IT A HOLE SEVERAL FEET IN DIAMETER MARKED THE SPOT WHERE THE CRUCIBLE FELL THE STUFF HAD DELAYED NOT AN INSTANT IN WORKING ITS HAVOC
HIS GLANCE SHIFTED TO THE CONTROL SWITCH UNDER HIS HAND ITS METAL KNOBS MARKING THE DEGREES OF INTENSITY OF THE CURRENT IT CONTROLLED CAUGHT THE LIGHT AND BLINKED LIKE SO MANY SMALL BALEFUL EYES
TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I CANNOT HEAR THAT AGAIN I SHALL BE ON THE PORCH WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH THE WINDOW NOAKES SEATED HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO A NEW EXPOSITION OF THE SUBJECT WHICH CHIEFLY AROUSED MAXINEFF'S INTEREST AND LOOSED HIS SPEECH
SAYING THAT HE COULDN'T STAND UP UNDER IT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE WONDERED IF IT WAS A BLUFF AFTER ALL THE FACE FADED AWAY LEAVING A DULL PITY BEHIND IT A STRUGGLING REMORSE
WHEN HE SAT DOWN IN THE DINER FOR HIS MORNING MEAL THE GREAT WHEEL OF THE HORIZON RIMMED ROUND HIS LITTLE TRAIN WITHOUT A NOTCH ON THE PERFECT CIRCLE OVER NIGHT THE OUTER WORLD HAD CHANGED BUT HE WAS ABSORBED IN FITTING HIS CHOICES INTO A SIXTY CENT BREAKFAST
THERE'S MY COLLATERAL MISTER CARGAN HE SAID WHIMSICALLY HE WAS SO HELPLESS AND SO ELEGANT IN HIS HELPLESSNESS THAT THE BULLY AWOKE IN CARGAN WITH AN EFFORT HE BROKE THROUGH THE NERVOUS DEFERENCE WITH WHICH WALDRON ALWAYS INSPIRED HIM AND SPOKE ROUGHLY
HIS FACE WAS COLORLESS HE MOVED THE LEVER FORWARD WITH A JERK AND LIFTING HIS EYES SAW HER PASS OUT OF THE GATE BEYOND REACH OF TIME HE WAITED EVENLY INSISTENTLY A DULL BROWN SUFFUSED THE MASS STILL HE WAITED
TWO HOURS ANYWAY CARGAN FLUNG HIS CIGARETTE ON THE GROUND I'LL MISS MY CONNECTION AT HAY JUNCTION HE PROTESTED I'VE GOTTA BE IN HAMDEN THIS AFTERNOON WALK THEN
MARTHA HE CALLED QUICKLY
THEY HELPED HIM ON AND POINTED OUT THE DIM LINE OF TELEPHONE POLES WHICH MARKED A ROAD A MILE BEYOND
THIS NEW THING WILL MAKE WAR TOO DREADFUL A COURSE FOR THE LEAST HUMANITARIAN NATION TO PURSUE THAT THE VARIANCE OF NATIONS TENDS TOWARD EQUILIBRIUM IS INCONTROVERTIBLE GRANTED THEN NOAKES WAS PRACTICAL HE PLACED BEFORE HIMSELF A DEFINITE GOAL
NOAKES LOOKED AT HIM IN A MOMENT OF AMAZEMENT ALMOST OF STUPEFACTION THE NECESSITY OF INSTANT ACTION STARTLED HIM TO MOVEMENT AS QUICKLY AS HE THOUGHT HE PUSHED THE DOOR THREE QUARTERS SHUT REPLACED THE JARS FROM WHICH HE HAD TAKEN HIS MATERIALS
