EDMOND'S HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AH SAID HE I HEAR A HUMAN VOICE EDMOND HAD NOT HEARD ANY ONE SPEAK SAVE HIS JAILER FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SOUP WHICH THE JAILER HAD BROUGHT ROSE STAGGERED TOWARDS IT RAISED THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS WITH A FEELING OF INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
HIS ENERGETIC SPIRIT THAT WOULD HAVE EXALTED IN THUS REVISITING THE PAST WAS IMPRISONED LIKE AN EAGLE IN A CAGE HE CLUNG TO ONE IDEA THAT OF HIS HAPPINESS DESTROYED WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE BY AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
IF IT IS A WORKMAN I NEED BUT KNOCK AGAINST THE WALL AND HE WILL CEASE TO WORK IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS KNOCKING AND WHY HE DOES SO BUT AS HIS OCCUPATION IS SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR HE WILL SOON RESUME IT
DANTES TOLD HIM THAT THE JUG HAD FALLEN FROM HIS HANDS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING AND THE JAILER WENT GRUMBLINGLY TO FETCH ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO REMOVE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BROKEN ONE HE RETURNED SPEEDILY ADVISED THE PRISONER TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND DEPARTED
AND WEARYING THE PATIENCE OF HIS JAILER WHO OUT OF KINDNESS OF HEART HAD BROUGHT BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR HIS PRISONER FORTUNATELY HE FANCIED THAT DANTES WAS DELIRIOUS AND PLACING THE FOOD ON THE RICKETY TABLE HE WITHDREW
OR REFUSE FOOD AND DIE OF STARVATION BUT THE FIRST WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
TWO HOURS PASSED AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE WALL ALL WAS SILENT THERE FULL OF HOPE EDMOND SWALLOWED A FEW MOUTHFULS OF BREAD AND WATER AND THANKS TO THE VIGOR OF HIS CONSTITUTION FOUND HIMSELF WELL NIGH RECOVERED
YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING FIRST YOU BREAK YOUR JUG THEN YOU MAKE ME BREAK YOUR PLATE IF ALL THE PRISONERS FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RUINED I SHALL LEAVE YOU THE SAUCEPAN AND POUR YOUR SOUP INTO THAT SO FOR THE FUTURE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO DIG ABOVE OR UNDER IT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED HE I HAVE SO EARNESTLY PRAYED TO YOU THAT I HOPED MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN HEARD
BUT IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD NOT DO MUCH AND HE SOON FELT THAT HE WAS WORKING AGAINST SOMETHING VERY HARD HE PUSHED BACK HIS BED AND WAITED FOR DAY ALL NIGHT HE HEARD THE SUBTERRANEAN WORKMAN WHO CONTINUED TO MINE HIS WAY DAY CAME THE JAILER ENTERED
NO SOONER HAD THIS IDEA TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM THAN HE BECAME MORE COMPOSED ARRANGED HIS COUCH TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER ATE LITTLE AND SLEPT LESS
JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
AND REBUILD THE ANCIENT CITIES SO VAST AND STUPENDOUS IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION AND THAT PASS BEFORE THE EYE GLOWING WITH CELESTIAL COLORS IN MARTIN'S BABYLONIAN PICTURES HE COULD NOT DO THIS HE WHOSE PAST LIFE WAS SO SHORT
HE LISTENED ALL WAS SILENT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DANTES SIGHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR DISTRUSTED HIM HOWEVER HE TOILED ON ALL THE NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISCOURAGED
AND WITHOUT EDUCATION HE COULD NOT THEREFORE IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS DUNGEON TRAVERSE IN MENTAL VISION THE HISTORY OF THE AGES BRING TO LIFE THE NATIONS THAT HAD PERISHED
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
OR THE PUNISHMENT THAT POSSIBLY WILL FOLLOW THERE IS A SORT OF CONSOLATION AT THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE YAWNING ABYSS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH LIE DARKNESS AND OBSCURITY EDMOND FOUND SOME SOLACE IN THESE IDEAS
HEAVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME STRENGTH BUT NOW ALL IS LOST ALL YES STOP UP YOUR EXCAVATION CAREFULLY DO NOT WORK ANY MORE AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME TELL ME AT LEAST WHO YOU ARE I AM
WHEN THE HOUR FOR HIS JAILER'S VISIT ARRIVED DANTES STRAIGHTENED THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN AS WELL AS HE COULD AND PLACED IT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE THE TURNKEY POURED HIS RATION OF SOUP INTO IT TOGETHER WITH THE FISH
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
I SWEAR TO YOU BY HIM WHO DIED FOR US THAT NAUGHT SHALL INDUCE ME TO BREATHE ONE SYLLABLE TO MY JAILERS BUT I CONJURE YOU DO NOT ABANDON ME IF YOU DO I SWEAR TO YOU FOR I HAVE GOT TO THE END OF MY STRENGTH
BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPLICATIONS NOT TO GOD BUT TO MAN GOD IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESOURCE UNFORTUNATES WHO OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH GOD DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPE IN HIM TILL THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS OF DELIVERANCE
YES SAID DANTES HE WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE EVENING SO THAT WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS BEFORE US I CAN WORK THEN SAID THE VOICE OH YES YES THIS INSTANT I ENTREAT YOU IN A MOMENT THAT PART OF THE FLOOR ON WHICH DANTES WAS RESTING HIS TWO HANDS
AS HE KNELT WITH HIS HEAD IN THE OPENING SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE DREW BACK SMARTLY WHILE A MASS OF STONES AND EARTH DISAPPEARED IN A HOLE THAT OPENED BENEATH THE APERTURE HE HIMSELF HAD FORMED
SINCE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN DANTES SHUDDERED THIS MAN HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS LONGER THAN HIMSELF IN PRISON DO NOT DIG ANY MORE SAID THE VOICE ONLY TELL ME HOW HIGH UP IS YOUR EXCAVATION
HE WAS SUSTAINED AT FIRST BY THAT PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE WHICH IS THE SEQUENCE TO HOPE THEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT HIS OWN INNOCENCE WHICH JUSTIFIED IN SOME MEASURE THE GOVERNOR'S BELIEF IN HIS MENTAL ALIENATION AND THEN RELAXING HIS SENTIMENT OF PRIDE
I HAVE A FATHER WHO IS SEVENTY IF HE YET LIVES I ONLY LOVE HIM AND A YOUNG GIRL CALLED MERCEDES MY FATHER HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN ME I AM SURE BUT GOD ALONE KNOWS IF SHE LOVES ME STILL I SHALL LOVE YOU AS I LOVED MY FATHER
AND A JAILER IS NO MAN TO A PRISONER HE IS A LIVING DOOR A BARRIER OF FLESH AND BLOOD ADDING STRENGTH TO RESTRAINTS OF OAK AND IRON
CARRIED IT INTO THE CORNER OF HIS CELL AND COVERED IT WITH EARTH THEN WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF HIS TIME WHILE HE HAD THE MEANS OF LABOR HE CONTINUED TO WORK WITHOUT CEASING AT THE DAWN OF DAY HE REPLACED THE STONE
AND IF PUNISHMENT WERE THE END IN VIEW OTHER TORTURES THAN DEATH MUST BE INVENTED HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON SUICIDE UNHAPPY HE WHO ON THE BRINK OF MISFORTUNE BROODS OVER IDEAS LIKE THESE
AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
FOR A CHANGE HOWEVER DISADVANTAGEOUS WAS STILL A CHANGE AND WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME AMUSEMENT HE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT TO HAVE FRESH AIR BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT GRANTED
AND FOUND EXISTENCE ALMOST SUPPORTABLE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HE COULD THROW IT OFF AT PLEASURE LIKE A WORN OUT GARMENT TWO METHODS OF SELF DESTRUCTION WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE COULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO THE WINDOW BARS
PROPOSED TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH AND AT THE END OF EVERY PRAYER INTRODUCED THE ENTREATY OFTENER ADDRESSED TO MAN THAN TO GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
AND CAPTIVITY THAT IS SHARED IS BUT HALF CAPTIVITY PLAINTS MADE IN COMMON ARE ALMOST PRAYERS AND PRAYERS WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER INVOKE THE MERCY OF HEAVEN
WHO TALKS OF GOD AND DESPAIR AT THE SAME TIME SAID A VOICE THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM BENEATH THE EARTH
WHO DID NOT GUESS HE HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY A CAPTIVE AS ANXIOUS FOR LIBERTY AS HIMSELF THREE DAYS PASSED SEVENTY TWO LONG TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH HE COUNTED OFF BY MINUTES AT LENGTH ONE EVENING
HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
I HAVE SEEN THE HEAVENS OVERCAST THE SEA RAGE AND FOAM THE STORM ARISE AND LIKE A MONSTROUS BIRD BEATING THE TWO HORIZONS WITH ITS WINGS THEN I FELT THAT MY VESSEL WAS A VAIN REFUGE THAT TREMBLED AND SHOOK BEFORE THE TEMPEST
SO THAT THE LEAST THING A GRAIN OF SAND A STRAW OR A BREATH OF AIR THAT ANNOYED HIM LED TO PAROXYSMS OF FURY THEN THE LETTER THAT VILLEFORT HAD SHOWED TO HIM RECURRED TO HIS MIND
A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCREW DRIVER TO TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AND CHAIR HAD NOTHING THE PAIL HAD ONCE POSSESSED A HANDLE BUT THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED
BEFORE HIM IS A DEAD SEA THAT STRETCHES IN AZURE CALM BEFORE THE EYE BUT HE WHO UNWARILY VENTURES WITHIN ITS EMBRACE FINDS HIMSELF STRUGGLING WITH A MONSTER THAT WOULD DRAG HIM DOWN TO PERDITION ONCE THUS ENSNARED
AND STRIVING TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM NO NO DOUBTLESS HE WAS DECEIVED AND IT WAS BUT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS THAT FORERUN DEATH
EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
BUT AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR HE HAD SCRAPED OFF A HANDFUL A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT HAVE CALCULATED THAT IN TWO YEARS SUPPOSING THAT THE ROCK WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A PASSAGE TWENTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET BROAD MIGHT BE FORMED
AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
NOW WHEN EVENING CAME DANTES PUT HIS PLATE ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR THE JAILER AS HE ENTERED STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE IT
AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF MY LIBERTY AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF DEATH AFTER HAVING RECALLED ME TO EXISTENCE MY GOD HAVE PITY ON ME AND DO NOT LET ME DIE IN DESPAIR
AND DURING THE FOUR DAYS THAT HE HAD BEEN CARRYING OUT HIS PURPOSE EDMOND HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE ATTENDANT HAD NOT ANSWERED HIM WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL WHEN HE LOOKED TOO CURIOUSLY AT HIM
IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A PRISONER THE NOISE I MAKE WILL ALARM HIM HE WILL CEASE AND NOT BEGIN AGAIN UNTIL HE THINKS EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP EDMOND ROSE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HIS LEGS DID NOT TREMBLE AND HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR
WHEN THE JAILER MOVED HIS BED AND STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE OPENING HE WOULD KILL HIM WITH HIS WATER JUG HE WOULD BE CONDEMNED TO DIE BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR WHEN THIS MIRACULOUS NOISE RECALLED HIM TO LIFE THE JAILER CAME IN THE EVENING
AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME DANTES SAID I WISH TO DIE AND HAD CHOSEN THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND FEARFUL OF CHANGING HIS MIND HE HAD TAKEN AN OATH TO DIE
THEN HE RAISED TO HIS LIPS THE REPAST THAT LIKE A VOLUNTARY TANTALUS HE REFUSED HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIS OATH AND HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT HE PERSISTED UNTIL AT LAST
DANTES UTTERED BLASPHEMIES THAT MADE HIS JAILER RECOIL WITH HORROR DASHED HIMSELF FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE WALLS OF HIS PRISON WREAKED HIS ANGER UPON EVERYTHING AND CHIEFLY UPON HIMSELF
EDMOND HEARD A HOLLOW SOUND IN THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LYING SO MANY LOATHSOME ANIMALS INHABITED THE PRISON THAT THEIR NOISE DID NOT IN GENERAL AWAKE HIM BUT WHETHER ABSTINENCE HAD QUICKENED HIS FACULTIES
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS THE ENMITY OF MAN AND NOT THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN THAT HAD THUS PLUNGED HIM INTO THE DEEPEST MISERY HE CONSIGNED HIS UNKNOWN PERSECUTORS TO THE MOST HORRIBLE TORTURES HE COULD IMAGINE AND FOUND THEM ALL INSUFFICIENT
AND DISCOVERED A NEW MEANING IN EVERY WORD FOR IN PROSPERITY PRAYERS SEEM BUT A MERE MEDLEY OF WORDS UNTIL MISFORTUNE COMES AND THE UNHAPPY SUFFERER FIRST UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING
I TOOK THE WALL YOU ARE MINING FOR THE OUTER WALL OF THE FORTRESS BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SEA THAT IS WHAT I HOPED AND SUPPOSING YOU HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
IT IS WELL RETURNED THE VOICE TO MORROW
I SWEAR TO YOU AGAIN RATHER THAN BETRAY YOU I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO BE HACKED IN PIECES
THE DAY PASSED AWAY IN UTTER SILENCE NIGHT CAME WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF THE NOISE IT IS A PRISONER SAID EDMOND JOYFULLY THE NIGHT PASSED IN PERFECT SILENCE EDMOND DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES
I HAVE LOST ALL THAT BOUND ME TO LIFE DEATH SMILES AND INVITES ME TO REPOSE I DIE AFTER MY OWN MANNER I DIE EXHAUSTED AND BROKEN SPIRITED AS I FALL ASLEEP WHEN I HAVE PACED THREE THOUSAND TIMES ROUND MY CELL
OF HAVING CONSPIRED TO AID THE EMPEROR'S RETURN
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HEAVEN HAD AT LENGTH TAKEN PITY ON HIM AND HAD SENT THIS NOISE TO WARN HIM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE BELOVED ONES HE HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT OF WAS THINKING OF HIM
OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
ALAS MURMURED THE VOICE OH WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED DANTES I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE OWING TO AN ERROR IN MY PLANS I TOOK THE WRONG ANGLE AND HAVE COME OUT FIFTEEN FEET FROM WHERE I INTENDED
IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
DANTES MIND HAD REVOLTED AT THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLAGES OF PRISONERS MADE UP OF THIEVES VAGABONDS AND MURDERERS HE NOW WISHED TO BE AMONGST THEM IN ORDER TO SEE SOME OTHER FACE BESIDES THAT OF HIS JAILER
THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
SUDDENLY ANOTHER IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS MIND SO USED TO MISFORTUNE THAT IT WAS SCARCELY CAPABLE OF HOPE THE IDEA THAT THE NOISE WAS MADE BY WORKMEN THE GOVERNOR HAD ORDERED TO REPAIR THE NEIGHBORING DUNGEON
HE RAPIDLY DEVOURED HIS FOOD AND AFTER WAITING AN HOUR LEST THE JAILER SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND RETURN HE REMOVED HIS BED TOOK THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN INSERTED THE POINT BETWEEN THE HEWN STONE AND ROUGH STONES OF THE WALL AND EMPLOYED IT AS A LEVER
AND HE LAID THE REQUEST OF NUMBER THIRTY FOUR BEFORE THE GOVERNOR BUT THE LATTER SAPIENTLY IMAGINED THAT DANTES WISHED TO CONSPIRE OR ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE AND REFUSED HIS REQUEST DANTES HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HUMAN RESOURCES
THE WINDOW GRATING WAS OF IRON BUT HE HAD TOO OFTEN ASSURED HIMSELF OF ITS SOLIDITY ALL HIS FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A BED A CHAIR A TABLE A PAIL AND A JUG THE BED HAD IRON CLAMPS BUT THEY WERE SCREWED TO THE WOOD
WHOSE PRESENT SO MELANCHOLY AND HIS FUTURE SO DOUBTFUL NINETEEN YEARS OF LIGHT TO REFLECT UPON IN ETERNAL DARKNESS NO DISTRACTION COULD COME TO HIS AID
YET IN SPITE OF HIS EARNEST PRAYERS DANTES REMAINED A PRISONER THEN GLOOM SETTLED HEAVILY UPON HIM
DANTES WAS ON HIS BED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THUS HE BETTER GUARDED THE UNFINISHED OPENING DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES FOR THE JAILER SAID COME ARE YOU GOING MAD AGAIN DANTES DID NOT ANSWER
YOU OF THOSE WHOM YOU LOVE AND I OF THOSE WHOM I LOVE YOU MUST LOVE SOMEBODY NO I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD THEN YOU WILL LOVE ME IF YOU ARE YOUNG I WILL BE YOUR COMRADE IF YOU ARE OLD I WILL BE YOUR SON
FOR THE EMPEROR'S RETURN THE EMPEROR IS NO LONGER ON THE THRONE THEN HE ABDICATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF ALL THIS
HE SIGHED FOR THE GALLEYS WITH THE INFAMOUS COSTUME THE CHAIN AND THE BRAND ON THE SHOULDER THE GALLEY SLAVES BREATHED THE FRESH AIR OF HEAVEN AND SAW EACH OTHER THEY WERE VERY HAPPY HE BESOUGHT THE JAILER ONE DAY TO LET HIM HAVE A COMPANION WERE IT EVEN THE MAD ABBE
DANTES HEARD JOYFULLY THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK HE LISTENED UNTIL THE SOUND OF STEPS DIED AWAY AND THEN HASTILY DISPLACING HIS BED SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT THAT PENETRATED INTO HIS CELL
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT SHIPWRECKED PERSONS HAD DIED THROUGH HAVING EAGERLY DEVOURED TOO MUCH FOOD EDMOND REPLACED ON THE TABLE THE BREAD HE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR AND RETURNED TO HIS COUCH HE DID NOT WISH TO DIE
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
HE MOVED AWAY WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS CELL TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AND THEN WENT BACK AND LISTENED THE MATTER WAS NO LONGER DOUBTFUL SOMETHING WAS AT WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
WAS HE TO BE THUS STOPPED AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS HE TO WAIT INACTIVE UNTIL HIS FELLOW WORKMAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM HE SMILED AND THE PERSPIRATION DRIED ON HIS FOREHEAD
HE LET THE JUG FALL ON THE FLOOR AND IT BROKE IN PIECES DANTES CONCEALED TWO OR THREE OF THE SHARPEST FRAGMENTS IN HIS BED LEAVING THE REST ON THE FLOOR THE BREAKING OF HIS JUG WAS TOO NATURAL AN ACCIDENT TO EXCITE SUSPICION EDMOND HAD ALL THE NIGHT TO WORK IN
A SAILOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN YOUR CRIME I AM INNOCENT
AS THE JAILER WAS VISITING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME THAT NIGHT
IF HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT COME TO HIM HE WOULD GO TO HIS NEIGHBOR ALL DAY HE TOILED ON UNTIRINGLY AND BY THE EVENING HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING TEN HANDFULS OF PLASTER AND FRAGMENTS OF STONE
AT THE END OF AN HOUR THE STONE WAS EXTRICATED FROM THE WALL LEAVING A CAVITY A FOOT AND A HALF IN DIAMETER
HE SOON FELT THAT HIS IDEAS BECAME AGAIN COLLECTED HE COULD THINK AND STRENGTHEN HIS THOUGHTS BY REASONING THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST PUT THIS TO THE TEST BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANYBODY
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
IN THREE DAYS HE HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION IN REMOVING THE CEMENT AND EXPOSING THE STONE WORK THE WALL WAS BUILT OF ROUGH STONES AMONG WHICH TO GIVE STRENGTH TO THE STRUCTURE BLOCKS OF HEWN STONE WERE AT INTERVALS IMBEDDED
ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
PUSHED HIS BED AGAINST THE WALL AND LAY DOWN THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A PIECE OF BREAD THE JAILER ENTERED AND PLACED THE BREAD ON THE TABLE WELL DON'T YOU INTEND TO BRING ME ANOTHER PLATE SAID DANTES NO REPLIED THE TURNKEY
UNLESS THE PROTECTING HAND OF GOD SNATCH HIM THENCE ALL IS OVER AND HIS STRUGGLES BUT TEND TO HASTEN HIS DESTRUCTION THIS STATE OF MENTAL ANGUISH IS HOWEVER LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE SUFFERINGS THAT PRECEDE
HOW OLD ARE YOU YOUR VOICE IS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN
HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT OF TAINTED FISH OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD IT WAS THE LAST YEARNING FOR LIFE CONTENDING WITH THE RESOLUTION OF DESPAIR
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
HE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO RISE AND CAST HIS SUPPER OUT OF THE LOOPHOLE THE NEXT MORNING HE COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR THE JAILER FEARED HE WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL EDMOND HOPED HE WAS DYING THUS THE DAY PASSED AWAY
HE WAS WRONG TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THE JAILER WAS WRONG NOT TO HAVE LOOKED BEFORE HIM THE JAILER THEREFORE ONLY GRUMBLED THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO POUR THE SOUP INTO DANTES ENTIRE DINNER SERVICE CONSISTED OF ONE PLATE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
BUT HE WENT ON ASKING ALL THE SAME HE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SPEAKING TO THE NEW JAILER ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE TACITURN THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL TO SPEAK TO A MAN EVEN THOUGH MUTE WAS SOMETHING
SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
HE FELT MORE GRATITUDE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THIS PIECE OF IRON THAN HE HAD EVER FELT FOR ANYTHING HE HAD NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THE PRISONER ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD CEASED TO LABOR NO MATTER THIS WAS A GREATER REASON FOR PROCEEDING
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
BUT NOW THE JAILER MIGHT HEAR THE NOISE AND PUT AN END TO IT AND SO DESTROY A RAY OF SOMETHING LIKE HOPE THAT SOOTHED HIS LAST MOMENTS THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM HIS BREAKFAST
HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
BLUE THE ONLY COLOR WE CAN FEEL INVISIBLE BLUE A POLICEMAN BLUSH A TEMPORARY ERYTHEMA AND CALORIFIC EFFULGENCE OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY AETEOLOGIZED BY THE PERCEPTIVENESS OF THE SENSORIUM
GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
BONE ONE DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF A WIFE NOTE ADAM WHO HAD TO GIVE UP ONE BONE BEFORE HE GOT EVE BONNETS A FEMALE HEAD TROUBLE WHICH IS CONTRACTED THE LATTER PART OF LENT AND BREAKS OUT ON EASTER BOODLE
HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
PRAECORDIA BOARD AN IMPLEMENT FOR ADMINISTERING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT USED BY MOTHERS AND LAND LADIES THE FESTIVE BOARD MAY BE A SHINGLE A HAIR BRUSH
FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
CAN BE FOUND ON THE OUTSIDE OF A SHORT RED STEER OR THE INSIDE OF A LONG BLACK BOTTLE BRASS BAND A CLEVER THOUGH SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED ARRANGEMENT FOR HOLDING A CROWD TOGETHER BRICK AN ADMIRABLE PERSON MADE OF THE RIGHT SORT OF CLAY AND POSSESSING PLENTY OF SAND
THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
BARS THINGS FOUND IN HARBORS HOTELS FENCES PRISONS COURTS AND MUSIC
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME ANGER OR OTHER CAUSE
COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
BY STANDER ONE WHO IS INJURED IN A STREET FIGHT
OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
BIGAMY A FORM OF INSANITY IN WHICH A MAN INSISTS ON PAYING THREE BOARD BILLS INSTEAD OF TWO BILLIOUSNESS A LIVER COMPLAINT OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR PIETY BILL OF FARE A LIST OF EATABLES
SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON
ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
BIRTH AN AID TO LIFE DISCOVERED BY WOMAN HIGHER PREFERRED BICYCLE SKIRT
A GAME IN WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WHO BRAVELY STRIKES OUT FOR HIMSELF RECEIVES NO PRAISE FOR IT BAT SENIOR PARTNER OF BAT BALL AND CO AND NEVER FOUND WITHOUT THE REST OF THE FIRM AS IT TAKES SEVERAL HIGH BALLS TO MAKE ONE SHORT BAT BEACH
HUMAN BLOCK KNOWN AS THE CRANIUM AND KEPT BY THE SARAH SISTERS SARAH BRUM AND SARAH BELUM ASSISTED BY MEDULLA OBLONGATA
FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
MUSCULAR FILAMENTS OF THE FACIAL CAPILLARIES WHEREBY BEING DIVESTED OF THEIR ELASTICITY
THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
WONDERFUL PARENTS ARE YET TO BE HEARD FROM WHO DON'T THINK THEIRS IS A WONDER A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL TO WHICH EVERYONE IN A SLEEPING CAR IS EAGER TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH BACHELOR FROM LATIN BACULUS A STICK UNATTACHED
USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE INTELLECT BROTHERS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
BOWER A SHADY RETREAT IN GENERAL BOWERY A SHADY RETREAT IN NEW YORK BRACE SECURITY FOR THE TROUSERS BRACER SECURITY FOR THE STOMACH BRACELET SECURITY FOR THE PAWN BROKER BRAIN
AND DEVELOPED IN DEPARTMENT STORES ON MONDAYS SYMPTOMS LOUD TALK PUSHING AND SHOVING A COMBINATION PRIZE FIGHT AND FOOT BALL SCRIMMAGE OLD SPELLING BARK GAIN BASEBALL
BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
A DESIRABLE QUALITY IN THE FOURTH OF JULY ORATION BUT NOT IN THE FIREWORKS BROKE A WORD EXPRESSING THE ULTIMATE CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS TOO MUCH BENT ON SPECULATING BUM A FALLEN TOUGH BUMP A TOUGH FALL BUNCO
AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
MAY BE FOUND IN A CASH BOOK OR THE KANGAROO GAIT BANDIT AN OUTLAW SEE ALDERMAN BARBER A BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONALIST WHO OCCASIONALLY SHAVES AND CUTS HAIR
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES EMBARRASSING EXPOSURE
IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
TO A MAN SHE IS PLAYING FOR A JAY BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY OF ONE'S BIRTH OBSERVED ONLY BY MEN AND CHILDREN BLUBBER THE USEFUL PRODUCT OF A DEAD WHALE THE USELESS PRODUCT OF A LIVE BABY
MONEY BORN OF POOR BUT DISHONEST PARENTS
THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
A STRIP OF SAND SKIRTED BY WATER COVERED WITH LADY KILLERS IN SUMMER LIFE SAVERS IN WINTER
DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK

THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS

MANY A YEAR AND MANY A DAY HAVE PASSED SINCE THESE EVENTS AWAY THE MONK HAS LONG BEEN A DUSTY CORSE
AND CURDIE HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INROAD WITH A PANG OF DESPAIR HE SAW HOW WRONG THEY HAD BEEN IN NOT SECURING THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE
AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER
SOME CONSTITUENT BODIES HAD UNDER THOSE WRITS ACTUALLY PROCEEDED TO THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH THE GENTRY AND YEOMANRY HAD NOT MANY MONTHS BEFORE FIXED UPON CANDIDATES

YEA ACUTELY FROM THE BLOW STRUCK HIM ON THE EVE OF ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT LOVE ALAS WHEN SMITTEN WITH THE SWORD OF INDIFFERENCE DIETH SOON BUT ONCE STRUCK ON THE TUNNELLED CHEEK OF SECRECY WITH THE HAND OF PITY
AND RUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS GUIDED BY THE SOUNDS OF STRIFE WHICH GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER WHEN HE REACHED THE GROUND FLOOR HE FOUND THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMING
AND SITTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT OF HER UPON WHOM SHE HAD THAT DAY FLUNG IN THE FACE OF DEVOTION THE LAST DREGS OF DEFIANCE BEGGED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR SUCH UNRULY CONDUCT AND ADDED
HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM SHOUTING ONE TWO HIT AND HEW THREE FOUR BLAST AND BORE AND WITH EVERY RHYME HE CAME DOWN A GREAT STAMP UPON A FOOT CUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FACES EXECUTING INDEED A SWORD DANCE OF THE WILDEST DESCRIPTION
ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
THE ELECTIONS WENT ON RAPIDLY AND SMOOTHLY THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY CONTESTS FOR THE NATION HAD DURING MORE THAN A YEAR BEEN KEPT IN CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF A PARLIAMENT WRITS INDEED HAD BEEN TWICE ISSUED AND TWICE RECALLED
EITHER IN TIME OF REJOICING OR SORROWING PREPARATIONS WERE AT LAST ALMOST COMPLETED FOR SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS EVENT INVITATIONS WERE ISSUED NUMEROUSLY FOR THE RECEPTION TO BE HELD AT DILWORTH CASTLE AFTER IRENE'S MARRIAGE
IT WOULD DIE ON THE DOORSTEP OF APPARENT BEREAVEMENT NEVER MORE TO APPEAR WITHIN DILWORTH CASTLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNEW WELL THAT THE GNAWING JAWS OF POVERTY WHICH FOR YEARS HAD FAILED TO EXPOSE THEIR GRINDING POWER
AFTER THE IMPORTANT CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED AND THE REGISTER SIGNED SIR JOHN AND LADY DUNFERN WHEN THE USUAL CONGRATULATIONS WERE ENDED
AND TOO SELDOM TERMINATES VICTORIOUSLY GREAT MERCY ONLY ANOTHER WEEK AND I SHALL ALMOST CEASE TO BE A FREE THINKER JUST SEVEN DAYS MORE AND WHAT I SHALL OPENLY HAVE TO CONFESS TO THE WORLD AN UNTRUTH
WOULD THERE BE ANY MEANS OF FLIGHT FROM THE DANGEROUS DRAGON THAT HAUNTS ME NIGHT AND DAY COULD ANYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO SAVE MYSELF FROM FALSE ALLIANCE TOO LATE TOO LATE
BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION
FANCYING HE HEARD THE GOBLINS ALL OVER THE HOUSE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY THEN THERE CAME AS HE THOUGHT A HAND UPON THE LOCK OF HIS DOOR IT OPENED AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A LADY WITH WHITE HAIR CARRYING A SILVER BOX IN HER HAND ENTER THE ROOM
BUT YET AGAIN HE FOUND HIMSELF SNUG IN BED TWENTY TIMES HE TRIED AND TWENTY TIMES HE FAILED FOR IN FACT HE WAS NOT AWAKE ONLY DREAMING THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR
NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
TOOK THE DRESSING FROM HIS LEG RUBBED IT WITH SOMETHING THAT SMELT LIKE ROSES AND THEN WAVED HER HANDS OVER HIM THREE TIMES AT THE LAST WAVE OF HER HANDS EVERYTHING VANISHED HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING INTO THE PROFOUNDEST SLUMBER
CHAPTER SIX THE SILVERY TOUCH OF FORTUNE IS TOO OFTEN GILT WITH BETRAYAL THE MEDDLING MOUTH OF EXTRAVAGANCE SWALLOWS EVERY DESIRE AND EATS THE HEART OF HONESTY WITH PICKLED PRIDE
CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND
THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO TASTE THE WINE AND AS HE HAD HOPED THEY NO SOONER TASTED THAN THEY WANTED MORE THE ROUTED GOBLINS ON THEIR WAY BELOW JOINED THEM AND WHEN CURDIE ENTERED THEY WERE ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
WHEN HE CAME UPON A WOMAN AND CHILD WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND FROM THAT POINT HE WENT ON DREAMING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE THUS MET THE PRINCESS AND LOOTIE HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE GOBLINS HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM
HOW HE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE PRINCESS EVERYTHING INDEED UNTIL HE WAS WOUNDED CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED BY THE MEN AT ARMS AND NOW HE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING WIDE AWAKE WHERE THEY HAD LAID HIM WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GREAT THUNDERING SOUND THE COBS ARE COMING
SEIZED WITH THE HORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT HARELIP HAD ALREADY CARRIED HER OFF HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM UNABLE FOR WRATH TO SING ANY MORE BUT STAMPING AND CUTTING WITH GREATER FURY THAN EVER
LEWIS REMARKED THE OMISSION AND NOTICED IT IN SUCH A VOICE AND WITH SUCH A LOOK THAT THE WHOLE PEERAGE WAS EVER AFTER READY TO KISS HER SHOE WHEN ESTHER JUST WRITTEN BY RACINE WAS ACTED AT SAINT CYR MARY HAD THE SEAT OF HONOUR
THE SETTING MOON WAS THROWING A FEEBLE LIGHT THROUGH THE CASEMENT AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THERE WAS SOFT HEAVY MULTITUDINOUS STAMPING A CLASHING AND CLANGING OF WEAPONS THE VOICES OF MEN AND THE CRIES OF WOMEN MIXED WITH A HIDEOUS BELLOWING
CURDIE MADE ONE STAB AT HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED CAUGHT HOLD OF THE SENSELESS LOOTIE AND HAVING DRAGGED HER BACK TO THE CORNER THERE MOUNTED GUARD OVER HER PREPARING ONCE MORE TO ENCOUNTER THE QUEEN
HAD NOT THE TUITIONAL CLICK OF BYGONE ATTACHMENT KEPT MOVING WITH MEASURED PACE UNTIL STOPPED AFTER MONTHS OR IT MAY BE SMALL YEARS OF CONSTANT SWINGING
PERSONS OF HIGH RANK WERE INSTANTLY DESPATCHED FROM VERSAILLES TO GREET AND ESCORT HIM MEANWHILE LEWIS ATTENDED BY HIS FAMILY AND HIS NOBILITY WENT FORTH IN STATE TO RECEIVE THE EXILED QUEEN
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GREAT HALL IN WHICH THE MOMENT HE ENTERED IT AROSE A GREAT GOBLIN SHOUT THE LAST OF THE MEN AT ARMS THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WAS ON THE FLOOR BURIED BENEATH A WALLOWING CROWD OF GOBLINS
SHE WAS RECONCILED THAT NEITHER THE MARRIAGE ROBE OF PURITY
HE FOUND THE BEDCLOTHES TOSSED ABOUT AND MOST OF THEM ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE PRINCESS'S GARMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT THE GOBLINS HAD BEEN THERE
THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THAT FOR WEEKS BEFORE HAD FOUND SUCH REFUGE WITHIN THEIR CHERISHED AND MUCH LOVED HOME
HE EMBRACED THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADE THE QUEEN SEAT HERSELF IN THE ROYAL STATE COACH ON THE RIGHT HAND THE CAVALCADE THEN TURNED TOWARDS SAINT GERMAINS
TO BESTOW UPON HER HIS CHOICE COLLECTION OF LOVE'S PUREST FRAGRANCE WHICH SHOULD CAST THE SWEETEST SCENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE DAZZLING APARTMENTS OF THE MANSION SHE WAS ABOUT TO GRACE
THEIR OPINION OF MARY WAS FAVOURABLE THEY FOUND HER PERSON AGREEABLE AND HER DEPORTMENT DIGNIFIED THEY RESPECTED HER COURAGE AND HER MATERNAL AFFECTION AND THEY PITIED HER ILL FORTUNE
BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER
AND SAW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER A TERRIFIED GROUP OF THE DOMESTICS UNWATCHED BUT COWERING WITHOUT COURAGE TO ATTEMPT THEIR ESCAPE AMONGST THEM WAS THE TERROR STRICKEN FACE OF LOOTIE BUT NOWHERE COULD HE SEE THE PRINCESS
THAT ALL WOULD BE REVEALED AT A FUTURE DATE WHEN LEAST EXPECTED IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE SIR JOHN WAS FIRST PUZZLED CONCERNING THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT WAS HE NOW MADE THE RECIPIENT OF THE ORIGINAL
WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBEVILLE HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT
AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
OR HAD SHE ONLY HINTED TO LADY DILWORTH HER MANIFEST INABILITY TO RETURN SIR JOHN'S GREAT AFFECTION MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REACHED ANOTHER CLIMAX BUT OWING TO THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS POSITION IN WHICH LORD AND LADY DILWORTH STOOD
NONE CAME FROM IRENE'S TUTOR OSCAR OTWELL AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE FIRST TO WHOM LADY DILWORTH ADDRESSED AN INVITATION STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY MUCH TO THE ANNOYANCE AND ASTONISHMENT OF HOSTESS ON THE ONE HAND
AND ELECTED WITHOUT ANY CONTEST FOUR GREAT MERCHANTS WHO WERE ZEALOUS WHIGS THE KING AND HIS ADHERENTS HAD HOPED THAT MANY RETURNING OFFICERS WOULD TREAT THE PRINCE'S LETTER AS A NULLITY BUT THE HOPE WAS DISAPPOINTED
BEING THE DAY SET APART FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR MARRIAGE IT COMMENCED WITH THE RINGING OF THE VILLAGE BELLS THE SUN SHONE FORTH IN ALL HIS UNIVERSAL GLORY
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOUDOIR SHALL OWN ME NO MORE WITH ITS WALLS OF PUREST WHITE AND GILDED BORDERS JUST SEVEN DAYS AND I SHALL BE FETTERED WITH CHAINS OF DRAGGING DISLIKE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
GOOD PROTESTANTS WHOM NO EXERTIONS MUST BE SPARED TO CARRY IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING AND OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THESE CANDIDATES WERE NOW GENERALLY RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE PRINCE GAVE STRICT ORDERS
THE RIGHT THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TAKE THE KING AND QUEEN PRISONERS AND HOLD THEM HOSTAGES FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS TO FIND HER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DETAINING THEM UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE HAVING THUS RESCUED THE SERVANTS THEY SET ABOUT SEARCHING THE HOUSE ONCE MORE
THE GOBLINS IN THE KING'S HOUSE WHEN CURDIE FELL ASLEEP HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MINE
CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO
AS BEFORE STATED FEW WERE THOSE INVITED TO BE PRESENT AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK NOON SIR JOHN ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE SHORTLY BEFORE THAT TIME LOOKING CHARMING INDEED
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE
OF LADY DILWORTH CHIEFLY AND THOSE PRESENT ALSO WHO ONLY THE EVENING PREVIOUS HAD BEEN POURING SUCH PRAISES OVER THE MAGNIFICENT DUCHESSE SATIN GOWN
FINDING CURDIE AGAIN BUSY AMONGST HER UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS SHE RUSHED AT HIM ONCE MORE WITH THE RAGE OF DESPAIR AND THIS TIME GAVE HIM A BAD BRUISE ON THE FOOT THEN A REGULAR STAMPING FIGHT GOT UP BETWEEN THEM
OR HER MADDENED DESIRE TO BECOME THE WIFE OF A POOR TUTOR HAD SHE ONLY TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE HER WHOSE WISE COUNSEL AND MOTHERLY EXAMPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES A PROMPT STEP TO DECISION
THAT SHE DARE NOT TRUST HERSELF TO OFFER HER THE FIRST MOTHERLY EMBRACE IRENE PERCEIVING THE GREAT EMBARRASSMENT OF HER BELOVED LADY DILWORTH GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM
SOON HOWEVER THE MAGNIFICENT KING CONCEIVED AN INEXPLICABLE DISGUST FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE HE QUITTED SAINT GERMAINS FOR VERSAILLES AND EXPENDED SUMS ALMOST FABULOUS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE
FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
WHERE EXCEPT A DISMAYED GOBLIN LURKING HERE AND THERE THEY FOUND NO ONE WHILE HE REQUESTED LOOTIE TO TAKE HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
BUT JAMES THEY REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONTEMPT THEY WERE DISGUSTED BY HIS INSENSIBILITY BY THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE TALKED TO EVERY BODY OF HIS RUIN AND BY THE CHILDISH PLEASURE WHICH HE TOOK IN THE POMP AND LUXURY OF VERSAILLES
WAS THE WHISPERED ECHO THROUGHOUT THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WHO SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST AFTER THE JUNCTION OF OPPOSITES YEA THIS WAS A REMARK OF TRUTH VISIBLY
IT WAS A MORNING NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN BY LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WHO ON THAT DAY WOULD BE ROBBED OF THE TREASURE HELD FIRM AND FAST BY THEM FOR THE LENGTHENED PERIOD OF NINE YEARS AND WHICH THEY YIELDED UP WITH HEARTS OF SORROW
DID SHE IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE TO WHOM SHE OWED ANYTHING BUT DISOBEDIENCE EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SHOULD BE WRESTED FROM HER ARMS OF COMPANIONSHIP ERE HER RETURN TO DUNFERN MANSION
IRENE WAS AROUSED BY THE RINGING OF THE BREAKFAST BELL BEFORE SHE GOT TIME TO FINISH THE SENTENCE THAT TROUBLED HER WEARY BRAIN FOR MONTHS BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF WITH FRANTIC EXPERTNESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE WINDING STAIRCASE
AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN
WHICH SOUNDED VICTORIOUS THE COBS WERE IN THE HOUSE HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED HURRIED ON SOME OF HIS CLOTHES NOT FORGETTING HIS SHOES WHICH WERE ARMED WITH NAILS THEN SPYING AN OLD HUNTING KNIFE OR SHORT SWORD HANGING ON THE WALL HE CAUGHT IT
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THUS SHALL END MY CHERISHED HOPES MY GIRLISH PRIDE MY MOST ARDENT WISH BUT ALAS NOT MY LOVE SEVEN DAYS MORE SHALL SEE MY OWN DARLING OS SUDDENLY
AND ASKING WHY IT APPEARED AT THIS GAY TIME WAS ANSWERED EVASIVELY INDEED LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS
IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
HER BELOVED BENEFACTORS WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME MOVERS IN THE MATTER OF MATRIMONY SAW PLAINLY A SADDENED LOOK ABOUT THE LOVELY FACE
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
JAMES WAS AT HER RIGHT HAND LEWIS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF ON THE LEFT NAY HE WAS WELL PLEASED THAT IN HIS OWN PALACE AN OUTCAST LIVING ON HIS BOUNTY SHOULD ASSUME THE TITLE OF KING OF FRANCE
BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THEY WENT BUT NOWHERE WAS SHE TO BE FOUND NEITHER WAS ONE OF THE SERVANTS TO BE SEEN BUT CURDIE WHO HAD KEPT TO THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOW QUIET ENOUGH BEGAN TO HEAR A CONFUSED SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUBBUB
AS SOON AS THE NEWS THAT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS ON THE FRENCH COAST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VERSAILLES A PALACE WAS PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION CARRIAGES AND TROOPS OF GUARDS WERE DESPATCHED TO AWAIT HER ORDERS
SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE HAD BEEN HASTILY SENT IN THE NURSERY OF THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FURNISHED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AN INFANT COULD REQUIRE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN THE KEY OF A SUPERB CASKET WHICH STOOD IN HER APARTMENT
ON A SPOT SINGULARLY STERILE AND UNWHOLESOME ALL SAND OR MUD WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT WATER AND WITHOUT GAME SAINT GERMAINS HAD NOW BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE ABODE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ENGLAND
HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
HE CAME DOWN WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS IRON SHOD SHOE UPON HER SKIN SHOD FOOT AND WITH A HIDEOUS HOWL SHE DROPPED HIM SQUATTED ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK HER FOOT IN BOTH HER HANDS MEANWHILE THE REST RUSHED ON THE KING AND THE BODYGUARD SENT THEM FLYING
THE BISHOP OF BARELEGS AND CANON FOOT WITH HIGHLY IMPRESSED AND OPEN FALSEHOOD AS THAT PRACTISED BY HER IN THE ABSENCE OF LABOURING UNDER SUCH A SOLEMN VOW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BREATHLESS SURPRISE
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
HE TOOK THE UNCEREMONIOUS LEAVE OF AN OLD FRIEND IN A FEW HOURS THE ROYAL PAIR WERE INFORMED THAT AS LONG AS THEY WOULD DO THE KING OF FRANCE THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT OF HIS HOSPITALITY
SHE BROKE FORTH INTO PASSIONATE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE MADAM SAID HER HOST IT IS BUT A MELANCHOLY SERVICE THAT I AM RENDERING YOU TO DAY I HOPE THAT I MAY BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO RENDER YOU SERVICES GREATER AND MORE PLEASING
LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH HAD BEEN BORN THERE HAD WHEN A YOUNG MAN HELD HIS COURT THERE HAD ADDED SEVERAL STATELY PAVILIONS TO THE MANSION OF FRANCIS AND HAD COMPLETED THE TERRACE OF HENRY
WITH AN ALACRITY BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED AND RUSHING INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE LORD AND LADY DILWORTH EAGERLY AWAITED HER PRESENTED THE OUTWARD MOCKING APPEARANCE OF BEING THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS
THE PARTY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO HIM WAS TRIUMPHANT ENTHUSIASTIC FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY THE PARTY FROM WHICH ALONE HE COULD EXPECT SERIOUS OPPOSITION WAS DISUNITED AND DISHEARTENED OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITSELF
CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER
BUT THE SAME MOMENT IN RUSHED THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN AND RAN AT THEM STAMPING FURIOUSLY THEY DARED NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH AN ONSET AWAY THEY SCURRIED THE QUEEN FOREMOST OF COURSE
DID THE THOUGHT EVER FLASH THROUGH HER MIND THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE BE ABLE TO POUR INTO THE EAR OF HER TRUSTED HELPER THE SECRETS OF THE HEART OF DECEPTION WHICH FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS HAD RAGED SO FURIOUSLY WITHIN HER
THE IMPOSTURY OF POSITION IS PETTY AND ENDS AS IT SHOULD COMMENCE WITH STIRRING STRIFE
THE QUEEN GAVE A HOWL OF RAGE AND DISMAY AND BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER PRESENCE OF MIND CURDIE HAVING BEGUN WITH THE GROUP NEAREST HIM HAD ELEVEN OF THE KNIGHTS ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE CRIED AS EACH MAN ROSE
THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM
THIS STRANGE APATHY THEY ATTRIBUTED NOT TO PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION BUT TO STUPIDITY AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT
AT SAINT GERMAINS ON THE VERGE OF A FOREST SWARMING WITH BEASTS OF CHASE AND ON THE BROW OF A HILL WHICH LOOKS DOWN ON THE WINDINGS OF THE SEINE FRANCIS THE FIRST HAD BUILT A CASTLE AND HENRY THE FOURTH HAD CONSTRUCTED A NOBLE TERRACE
THUS WERE JOINED TWO HEARTS OF WIDELY DIFFERENT BEAT ONE OF INTENSE LOVE WHICH HEARSAY NEVER COULD SHAKE THE OTHER OF DIRE DISLIKE WHICH REASON COULD NEVER ALTER BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
EMBLEMS OF THE APPROACHING FESTIVITY DID NOT FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE HOUSETOPS OF THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE PEASANT GLADNESS REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL HEARTS SAVE TWO REJOICED WITH UNABATED ACTIVITY
SUCH TRIFLES WERE SERIOUS MATTERS AT THE OLD COURT OF FRANCE THERE WERE PRECEDENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT LEWIS DECIDED THE POINT AGAINST HIS OWN BLOOD SOME LADIES OF ILLUSTRIOUS RANK OMITTED THE CEREMONY OF KISSING THE HEM OF MARY'S ROBE
HAD REACHED THE LAST AND ONLY BITE OF SUDDEN TERMINATION AND THEREBY STAMPED THEIR MARKS OF MELANCHOLY SO IMPRESSIVELY UPON THE NOBLE BROWS OF THE WORTHY OWNERS OF DILWORTH CASTLE THAT TIME COULD NEVER BLOT THEM FROM OBSERVATION
HERE IS A GENTLEMAN SAID LEWIS TO MARY WHOM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THEN AFTER ENTREATING HIS GUESTS TO VISIT HIM NEXT DAY AT VERSAILLES AND TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING THEM HIS BUILDINGS PICTURES AND PLANTATIONS
AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
AWAY SCATTERED THE GOBLINS IN EVERY DIRECTION INTO CLOSETS UP STAIRS INTO CHIMNEYS UP ON RAFTERS AND DOWN TO THE CELLARS CURDIE WENT ON STAMPING AND SLASHING AND SINGING BUT SAW NOTHING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
THE REST MEANTIME FINDING THEIR ADVERSARY THUS MATCHED FOR THE MOMENT PAUSED IN THEIR HEADLONG HURRY AND TURNED TO THE SHIVERING GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE CORNER AS IF DETERMINED TO EMULATE HIS FATHER AND HAVE A SUN WOMAN OF SOME SORT TO SHARE HIS FUTURE THRONE
LURK NO MORE AROUND THE VALE OF VANITY LIKE A VINDICTIVE VIPER STRIKE THE LYRE OF LIVING DECEPTION TO THE STRAINS OF DULL DEADNESS DESPAIR AND DOUBT
CAME DOWN AS SHE STARTED BACK WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE PROPER FOOT AND SPRUNG TO LOOTIE'S RESCUE THE PRINCE HAD TWO DEFENCELESS FEET AND ON BOTH OF THEM CURDIE STAMPED JUST AS HE REACHED THE HOLE HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN AND ROLLED SHRIEKING INTO THE EARTH
NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
AND THAT THE CHARACTERS COME SECOND COMPARE THE PARALLEL IN PAINTING WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS LAID ON WITHOUT ORDER WILL NOT GIVE ONE THE SAME PLEASURE AS A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A PORTRAIT
B PLUS C OR TO TAKE ANOTHER INSTANCE
BUT THE TWO INCIDENTS HAD NO PROBABLE OR NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE TOOK AN ACTION WITH A UNITY OF THE KIND WE ARE DESCRIBING AS THE SUBJECT OF THE ODYSSEY AS ALSO OF THE ILIAD
AND SO IT SUFFICES ME TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD ALDONZA LORENZO IS FAIR AND VIRTUOUS AND AS TO HER PEDIGREE IT IS VERY LITTLE MATTER FOR NO ONE WILL EXAMINE INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFERRING ANY ORDER UPON HER
OR OF TWO SIGNIFICANT PARTS IT IS POSSIBLE ALSO TO HAVE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE OR HIGHER COMPOUNDS LIKE MOST OF OUR AMPLIFIED NAMES
THE TURNS GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN SPOKEN
AND HAS ALSO ANOTHER AFTER IT A WELL CONSTRUCTED PLOT THEREFORE CANNOT EITHER BEGIN OR END AT ANY POINT ONE LIKES BEGINNING AND END IN IT MUST BE OF THE FORMS JUST DESCRIBED
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE SIX IS THE COMBINATION OF THE INCIDENTS OF THE STORY TRAGEDY IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMITATION NOT OF PERSONS BUT OF ACTION AND LIFE OF HAPPINESS AND MISERY
AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
THESE WILL SERVE THEE AFTER THE FASHION OF THE CLUE IN THE LABYRINTH OF THESEUS AS MARKS AND SIGNS FOR FINDING ME ON THY RETURN SO I WILL SAID SANCHO PANZA AND HAVING
WITH ITS SEVERAL INCIDENTS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED THAT THE TRANSPOSAL OR WITHDRAWAL
HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
BY ATTEMPTING TO DRAMATIZE FOR INSTANCE THE ENTIRE STORY OF THE ILIAD IN THE EPIC OWING TO ITS SCALE EVERY PART IS TREATED AT PROPER LENGTH WITH A DRAMA HOWEVER ON THE SAME STORY THE RESULT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
DENOUEMENT YET THERE ARE MANY DRAMATISTS WHO AFTER A GOOD COMPLICATION FAIL IN THE DENOUEMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH POINTS OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE ALWAYS DULY MASTERED
I AM NOT SO MAD ANSWERED SANCHO BUT I AM MORE PEPPERY BUT APART FROM ALL THIS WHAT HAS YOUR WORSHIP TO EAT UNTIL I COME BACK WILL YOU SALLY OUT ON THE ROAD LIKE CARDENIO TO FORCE IT FROM THE SHEPHERDS
INDIVISIBLE SOUNDS ARE UTTERED BY THE BRUTES ALSO BUT NO ONE OF THESE IS A LETTER IN OUR SENSE OF THE TERM THESE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS ARE EITHER VOWELS SEMIVOWELS OR MUTES
AND FELT EASY AND SATISFIED IN HIS MIND THAT HE COULD SWEAR HE HAD LEFT HIS MASTER MAD AND SO WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ROAD UNTIL HIS RETURN
OR NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER TO DO SO ON THE GROUND BEFORE ALL ELSE OF THEIR PLOT
IN THIS WAY SEEING EVERYTHING WITH THE VIVIDNESS OF AN EYE WITNESS AS IT WERE HE WILL DEVISE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BE LEAST LIKELY TO OVERLOOK INCONGRUITIES THIS IS SHOWN BY WHAT WAS CENSURED IN
A NON SIGNIFICANT SOUND WHICH WHEN ONE SIGNIFICANT SOUND IS FORMABLE OUT OF SEVERAL NEITHER HINDERS NOR AIDS THE UNION AND WHICH IF THE SPEECH
AND HIS SON'S DEATH PLOTTED BY SUITORS TO HIS WIFE THEN HE ARRIVES THERE HIMSELF AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS SUFFERINGS REVEALS HIMSELF AND FALLS ON HIS ENEMIES AND THE END IS HIS SALVATION AND THEIR DEATH
NOTHING OF THE KIND THEY ONLY INVENT THEM FOR THE MOST PART TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THEIR VERSES AND THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LOVERS OR FOR MEN VALIANT ENOUGH TO BE SO
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
THE TRAGEDIES OF MOST OF THE MODERNS ARE CHARACTERLESS A DEFECT COMMON AMONG POETS OF ALL KINDS AND WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN PAINTING
WHETHER THE POET KNOWS THESE THINGS OR NOT HIS ART AS A POET IS NEVER SERIOUSLY CRITICIZED ON THAT ACCOUNT
IS NOT TO BE MENTIONED IN THE HOUSE OF HIM WHO HAS BEEN HANGED BUT NOW FOR THE LETTER AND THEN GOD BE WITH YOU I AM OFF DON QUIXOTE TOOK OUT THE NOTE BOOK AND RETIRING TO ONE SIDE VERY DELIBERATELY BEGAN TO WRITE THE LETTER
WITHOUT MORE ADO HE CUT A COUPLE OF GAMBADOS IN THE AIR AND A COUPLE OF SOMERSAULTS HEELS OVER HEAD
P S OR IN THE TWO COMPOUNDS OF THIS LAST P S AND X ARE MASCULINES ALL ENDING IN THE INVARIABLY LONG VOWELS
AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS CONSTRUCTING HIS PLOTS AND ENGAGED ON THE DICTION IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKED OUT THE POET SHOULD REMEMBER ONE TO PUT THE ACTUAL SCENES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIS EYES
OF THEIR ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THEIR LIVES NOW THE ACTION THAT WHICH WAS DONE IS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAY BY THE FABLE OR PLOT THE FABLE
AND NEED NOT BE COUNTED THERE IS NO NOUN HOWEVER ENDING IN A MUTE OR IN EITHER OF THE TWO SHORT VOWELS E AND O ONLY THREE
COSTUMIER THAN THE POET
CUT SOME HE ASKED HIS MASTER'S BLESSING AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS ON BOTH SIDES TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIM
NOR ANY OTHER OF THE FAMOUS WOMEN OF TIMES PAST GREEK BARBARIAN OR LATIN AND LET EACH SAY WHAT HE WILL FOR IF IN THIS I AM TAKEN TO TASK BY THE IGNORANT I SHALL NOT BE CENSURED BY THE CRITICAL
IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT IN A COMPOUND WE DO NOT THINK OF THE PARTS AS HAVING A SIGNIFICANCE ALSO BY THEMSELVES IN THE NAME THEODORUS FOR INSTANCE THE DORON MEANS NOTHING TO US
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORY AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF NEARLY ALL THE EARLY DRAMATISTS WE MAINTAIN THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL THE LIFE AND SOUL SO TO SPEAK OF TRAGEDY IS THE PLOT
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SWEAR WITHOUT A WEIGHT ON MY CONSCIENCE THAT I HAD SEEN YOU DO MAD THINGS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO SEE IF IT WERE ONLY ONE THOUGH IN YOUR WORSHIP'S REMAINING HERE I HAVE SEEN A VERY GREAT ONE
IN A DRAMATIC NOT IN A NARRATIVE FORM WITH INCIDENTS AROUSING PITY AND FEAR WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CATHARSIS OF SUCH EMOTIONS
THE STORY ALSO OF HERACLES MUST BE ONE STORY HOMER HOWEVER EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT QUITE WELL WHETHER BY ART OR INSTINCT JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS HE EXCELS THE REST IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT
THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
POLEOS PELEIADEO FOR PELEIDON IT IS SAID TO BE CURTAILED WHEN IT HAS LOST A PART
THIS BEING ALL THAT IS PROPER TO THE ODYSSEY EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT IS EPISODE
AS FAR AS MAY BE TOO THE POET SHOULD EVEN ACT HIS STORY WITH THE VERY GESTURES OF HIS PERSONAGES GIVEN THE SAME NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS HE WHO FEELS THE EMOTIONS TO BE DESCRIBED WILL BE THE MOST CONVINCING
A CASE OF A NOUN OR VERB IS WHEN THE WORD MEANS OF OR TO A THING AND SO FORTH
END IN I AND FIVE IN T
AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
POLYGNOTUS FOR WHEREAS THE LATTER IS STRONG IN CHARACTER THE WORK OF ZEUXIS IS DEVOID OF IT AND AGAIN ONE MAY STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC SPEECHES OF THE UTMOST FINISH AS REGARDS DICTION AND THOUGHT
AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
AS LONG SHORT OR OF VARIABLE QUANTITY AND FURTHER AS HAVING AN ACUTE GRAVE OR INTERMEDIATE ACCENT THE DETAILS OF THESE MATTERS WE MUST LEAVE TO THE METRICIANS
ON HIS COMING HE WAS ARRESTED AND ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN HE REVEALED WHO HE WAS
THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
D TO THE THIRD C FOR ONE MAY THEN METAPHORICALLY PUT B IN LIEU OF D AND D IN LIEU OF B NOW AND THEN TOO THEY QUALIFY
DID I NOT TELL THEE SO SAID DON QUIXOTE WAIT SANCHO AND I WILL DO THEM IN THE SAYING OF A CREDO AND PULLING OFF HIS BREECHES IN ALL HASTE HE STRIPPED HIMSELF TO HIS SKIN AND HIS SHIRT AND THEN
A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE TO BE FOUND IN DULCINEA IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE FOR IN BEAUTY NO ONE EQUALS HER AND IN GOOD NAME FEW APPROACH HER AND TO PUT THE WHOLE THING IN A NUTSHELL I PERSUADE MYSELF THAT ALL I SAY IS AS I SAY
BUT IF IT IS YOUR WORSHIP'S PLEASURE THAT I SHOULD SEE SOME INSANITIES DO THEM IN YOUR CLOTHES SHORT ONES AND SUCH AS COME READIEST TO HAND FOR I MYSELF WANT NOTHING OF THE SORT AND AS I HAVE SAID IT WILL BE A SAVING OF TIME FOR MY RETURN
OR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
WHICH PROTAGORAS HAS CRITICIZED AS BEING A COMMAND WHERE A PRAYER WAS MEANT SINCE TO BID ONE DO OR NOT DO HE TELLS US IS A COMMAND
AND THE LIKE WHATEVER ITS STRUCTURE A NOUN MUST ALWAYS BE EITHER ONE THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THE THING OR TWO A STRANGE WORD OR THREE A METAPHOR
THINE TILL DEATH THE KNIGHT OF THE RUEFUL COUNTENANCE BY THE LIFE OF MY FATHER SAID SANCHO WHEN HE HEARD THE LETTER
TO THIS EFFECT MISTRESS NIECE BY THIS FIRST OF ASS COLTS PLEASE PAY TO SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE THREE OF THE FIVE I LEFT AT HOME IN YOUR CHARGE SAID THREE ASS COLTS TO BE PAID AND DELIVERED FOR THE SAME
THE HEALTH THAT HE HIMSELF ENJOYS NOT IF THY BEAUTY DESPISES ME IF THY WORTH IS NOT FOR ME IF THY SCORN IS MY AFFLICTION THOUGH I BE SUFFICIENTLY LONG SUFFERING HARDLY SHALL I ENDURE THIS ANXIETY WHICH
LET NOT THAT ANXIETY TROUBLE THEE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE FOR EVEN IF I HAD IT I SHOULD NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT THE HERBS AND THE FRUITS WHICH THIS MEADOW AND THESE TREES MAY YIELD ME THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS OF MINE LIES IN NOT EATING
AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES THESE SIX OF THESE ITS FORMATIVE ELEMENTS
SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
IF SHE KNEW ME SHE'D BE IN AWE OF ME IN FAITH SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE TO ALL APPEARANCE THOU ART NO SOUNDER IN THY WITS THAN I
OR WHITE DOES NOT IMPLY WHEN WALKS AND HAS WALKED INVOLVE IN ADDITION TO THE IDEA OF WALKING THAT OF TIME PRESENT OR TIME PAST SEVEN
SO I TOO AM DOOMED TO BE SACRIFICED AS MY SISTER WAS AND THE DISCLOSURE LED TO HIS SALVATION THIS DONE THE NEXT THING AFTER THE PROPER NAMES HAVE BEEN FIXED AS A BASIS FOR THE STORY
IN WRITING AN ODYSSEY HE DID NOT MAKE THE POEM COVER ALL THAT EVER BEFELL HIS HERO IT BEFELL HIM FOR INSTANCE TO GET WOUNDED ON PARNASSUS AND ALSO TO FEIGN MADNESS AT THE TIME OF THE CALL TO ARMS
WITH AN A THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE SYLLABLE ALSO BELONG TO THE THEORY OF METRE THREE A CONJUNCTION IS A
THE LETTER OR ULTIMATE ELEMENT THE SYLLABLE THE CONJUNCTION THE ARTICLE THE NOUN THE VERB THE CASE AND THE SPEECH ONE
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER FORM OF QUALIFIED METAPHOR HAVING GIVEN THE THING THE ALIEN NAME ONE MAY BY A NEGATIVE ADDITION DENY OF IT ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NEW NAME
C SO IS EVENING B TO DAY A ONE WILL ACCORDINGLY DESCRIBE EVENING B AS THE OLD AGE OF THE DAY D PLUS A OR BY THE
CERTAIN ALSO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PLAY FORMING THE COMPLICATION AND THE REST THE DENOUEMENT BY COMPLICATION I MEAN ALL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY TO THE POINT JUST BEFORE THE CHANGE IN THE HERO'S FORTUNES BY
I SAY THAT YOUR WORSHIP IS ENTIRELY RIGHT SAID SANCHO AND THAT I AM AN ASS BUT I KNOW NOT HOW THE NAME OF ASS CAME INTO MY MOUTH FOR A ROPE
IS TO WORK IN EPISODES OR ACCESSORY INCIDENTS ONE MUST MIND HOWEVER THAT THE EPISODES ARE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE FIT OF MADNESS IN ORESTES WHICH LED TO HIS ARREST AND THE PURIFYING WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT HIS SALVATION
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A MEAN LOW STUPID FELLOW AS SO AND SO WHEN IN THIS HOUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MASTERS GRADUATES AND DIVINITY STUDENTS FROM AMONG WHOM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE AS IF THEY WERE A LOT OF PEARS SAYING THIS ONE I'LL TAKE
AND BY THE KINDS SEPARATELY I MEAN THAT SOME PORTIONS ARE WORKED OUT WITH VERSE ONLY AND OTHERS IN
EMPEDOCLEAN EQUIVALENT AND OLD AGE D AS THE EVENING OR SUNSET OF LIFE B PLUS C
AND IN THE SECOND MELODY AND DICTION THESE TWO BEING THE MEANS OF THEIR IMITATION HERE BY DICTION I MEAN MERELY THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THE VERSES AND BY MELODY WHAT IS TOO COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION
THOUGH NOT IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME PEOPLE SIGUNOS FOR INSTANCE IS AN ORDINARY WORD IN CYPRUS AND A STRANGE WORD WITH US
IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT A SPEECH IS NOT ALWAYS MADE UP OF NOUN AND VERB IT MAY BE WITHOUT A VERB LIKE THE DEFINITION OF MAN BUT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME PART WITH A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY ITSELF IN THE SPEECH
AND I FOR MY PART RECKON HER THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS IN THE WORLD FOR THOU SHOULDST KNOW SANCHO IF THOU DOST NOT KNOW THAT TWO THINGS ALONE BEYOND ALL OTHERS ARE INCENTIVES TO LOVE AND THESE ARE GREAT BEAUTY AND A GOOD NAME
ALL THAT THEY WILL BE METAPHORICALLY DESCRIBED IN JUST THE SAME WAY THUS TO CAST FORTH SEED
A SIZE TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE EYE SO A STORY OR PLOT MUST BE OF SOME LENGTH BUT OF A LENGTH TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE MEMORY AS FOR THE LIMIT OF ITS LENGTH SO FAR AS THAT IS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AND SPECTATORS
WHERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS HENCE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CHARACTER IN A SPEECH ON A PURELY INDIFFERENT SUBJECT THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SHOWN IN ALL THEY SAY WHEN PROVING OR DISPROVING SOME PARTICULAR POINT
THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN
FOR THE OLDER POETS MAKE THEIR PERSONAGES DISCOURSE LIKE STATESMEN AND THE MODERNS LIKE RHETORICIANS
SOVEREIGN AND EXALTED LADY THE PIERCED BY THE POINT OF ABSENCE THE WOUNDED TO THE HEART'S CORE SENDS THEE SWEETEST DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
LONG AFTER THAT THE BROTHER OF THE PRIESTESS HAPPENED TO COME THE FACT HOWEVER OF THE ORACLE HAVING FOR A CERTAIN REASON BIDDEN HIM GO THITHER AND HIS OBJECT IN GOING ARE OUTSIDE THE PLOT OF THE PLAY
THAT WILL DO SAID SANCHO NOW LET YOUR WORSHIP SIGN IT THERE IS NO NEED TO SIGN IT SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT MERELY TO PUT MY FLOURISH WHICH IS THE SAME AS A SIGNATURE AND ENOUGH FOR THREE ASSES OR EVEN THREE HUNDRED
EITHER FAIL UTTERLY OR HAVE BUT ILL SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
HER LADYSHIP HAD BEST NOT DRIVE ME TO SAY IT FOR BY GOD I WILL SPEAK OUT AND LET OFF EVERYTHING CHEAP EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SELL I AM PRETTY GOOD AT THAT SHE LITTLE KNOWS ME FAITH
AND YET FAIL TO PRODUCE THE TRUE TRAGIC EFFECT BUT ONE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH A TRAGEDY WHICH HOWEVER INFERIOR IN THESE RESPECTS HAS A PLOT A COMBINATION OF INCIDENTS IN IT
CLEON WALKS CLEON IS AN INSTANCE OF SUCH A PART A SPEECH IS SAID TO BE ONE IN TWO WAYS EITHER AS SIGNIFYING ONE THING OR AS A UNION OF SEVERAL SPEECHES MADE INTO ONE BY CONJUNCTION
OF A SIGNIFICANT AND A NON SIGNIFICANT PART
THE LETTERS DIFFER IN VARIOUS WAYS AS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONS OR IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE MOUTH AS ASPIRATED NOT ASPIRATED OR SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER
THOU MUST KNOW THAT A CERTAIN WIDOW FAIR YOUNG INDEPENDENT AND RICH AND ABOVE ALL FREE AND EASY FELL IN LOVE WITH A STURDY STRAPPING YOUNG LAY BROTHER HIS SUPERIOR CAME TO KNOW OF IT
CHARACTERS DICTION THOUGHT SPECTACLE AND MELODY TWO OF THEM ARISING FROM THE MEANS ONE FROM THE MANNER AND THREE FROM THE OBJECTS OF THE DRAMATIC IMITATION
SUNLIGHT A AS SOWING D TO THE SEED CORN C HENCE THE EXPRESSION IN THE POET SOWING AROUND A GOD CREATED FLAME D PLUS A
OF THIS LAST KIND EIGHT A SPEECH IS A COMPOSITE SIGNIFICANT SOUND SOME OF THE PARTS OF WHICH HAVE A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY THEMSELVES
WHICH WILL BE WITH THE NEWS YOUR WORSHIP DESIRES AND DESERVES IF NOT LET THE LADY DULCINEA LOOK TO IT IF SHE DOES NOT ANSWER REASONABLY
OBSERVE THE LANDMARKS WELL SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR I WILL TRY NOT TO GO FAR FROM THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WILL EVEN TAKE CARE TO MOUNT THE HIGHEST OF THESE ROCKS TO SEE IF I CAN DISCOVER THEE RETURNING
BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
THOUGH AN ATTRACTION IS THE LEAST ARTISTIC OF ALL THE PARTS AND HAS LEAST TO DO WITH THE ART OF POETRY THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS QUITE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AND ACTORS
THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS
IF IT BE THY PLEASURE TO GIVE ME RELIEF I AM THINE IF NOT DO AS MAY BE PLEASING TO THEE FOR BY ENDING MY LIFE I SHALL SATISFY THY CRUELTY AND MY DESIRE
YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN
AN INSTANCE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CALL THE SHIELD
THAT WE ARE HAPPY OR THE REVERSE IN A PLAY ACCORDINGLY THEY DO NOT ACT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY THE CHARACTERS THEY INCLUDE THE CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION
AND I PROMISE THEE THOU WILT NOT TELL OF AS MANY AS I MEAN TO PERFORM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MASTER MINE SAID SANCHO
HAVE AS MUCH CARE AS OF HIS OWN PERSON HE SET OUT FOR THE PLAIN STREWING AT INTERVALS THE BRANCHES OF BROOM AS HIS MASTER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY THOUGH DON QUIXOTE STILL ENTREATED HIM TO SEE HIM
THAT FROM SPECIES TO GENUS IN TRULY TEN THOUSAND GOOD DEEDS HAS ULYSSES WROUGHT WHERE TEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A PARTICULAR LARGE NUMBER IS PUT IN PLACE OF THE GENERIC A LARGE NUMBER
THE FOURTH CONSTITUENT IS THAT OF SPECTACLE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
A VOWEL IS A LETTER HAVING AN AUDIBLE SOUND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LETTER
ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID MORE THAN ONCE AND NOT WRITE A TRAGEDY ON AN EPIC BODY OF INCIDENT
I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
THAT IS THE HOUSE OF SHAWS SHE CRIED BLOOD BUILT IT BLOOD STOPPED THE BUILDING OF IT BLOOD SHALL BRING IT DOWN SEE HERE SHE CRIED AGAIN I SPIT UPON THE GROUND AND CRACK MY THUMB AT IT BLACK BE ITS FALL
THEY RESTED AWHILE AND THEN TOOK ANOTHER WHICH FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY CALLED DINNER AFTER DINNER THE BOYS SAT WARMING THEMSELVES AT THE INN ALL BUT PETER WHO OCCUPIED THE TIME IN ANOTHER FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR DOCTOR BOEKMAN
LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
THEN GENTLY COLLAPSED UPON HIS FACE AND MOVED NO MORE I LEAPED TO MY FEET AND HAILED THE RIDERS THEY WERE PULLING UP AT ANY RATE
IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WING OF A HOUSE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN FINISHED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE INNER END STOOD OPEN ON THE UPPER FLOORS AND SHOWED AGAINST THE SKY WITH STEPS AND STAIRS OF UNCOMPLETED MASONRY MANY OF THE WINDOWS WERE UNGLAZED
ASCENDED TO A HIGH MOUND WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTER THIS WAS THE SITE OF A ROUND TOWER NOW IN RUINS SAID BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY HENGIST THE ANGLO SAXON KING
DOWN WENT THE STONE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND LEFT ME SITTING HERE ON TOP WITH BOTH MY FEET IN THE AIR IF I HAD NOT THROWN MYSELF BACK AT THAT MOMENT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE ROLLED OVER AFTER THE STONE WELL IT IS NO MATTER
THE CITY IS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS WATER ROADS FORMED BY THE RIVER RHINE THERE GROWN SLUGGISH FATIGUED BY ITS LONG TRAVEL BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STONE BRIDGES REUNITE THE DISSEVERED STREETS
AND SLOW AS I BEGAN TO TRAVEL I STILL KEPT ASKING MY WAY AND STILL KEPT ADVANCING
BUT THE BOYS SPENT A FEW PLEASANT MOMENTS IN THE STADHUIS OR TOWN HALL A LONG IRREGULAR STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT IN THE GOTHIC STYLE UNCOUTH IN ARCHITECTURE BUT PICTURESQUE FROM AGE ITS LITTLE STEEPLE TUNEFUL WITH BELLS
BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
BUT A TRAGEDY CAME IN SPITE OF HIM POOT WAS BENDING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH WALL IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM TO GROW DIZZY AND TUMBLE OFF BEN TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY IF THE FELLOW WITH HIS WEAK HEAD
AND BY OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASTLE OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT COUNTS OF HOLLAND AS THE BOYS WALKED ABOUT ON THE TOP OF ITS STONE WALL THEY COULD GET BUT A POOR VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING CITY
AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
THE NEXT PERSON I CAME ACROSS WAS A DAPPER LITTLE MAN IN A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WIG WHOM I SAW TO BE A BARBER ON HIS ROUNDS AND KNOWING WELL THAT BARBERS WERE GREAT GOSSIPS I ASKED HIM PLAINLY WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS MISTER BALFOUR OF THE SHAWS
HE CRIED WE DON'T SEE IT HERE NOHOW RETURNED THE MAN HERE YOU BELOW THERE IS IT ON BILL CRIED THE BLIND MAN AGAIN
SQUALLING WAS THE WORD FOR IT PEW'S ANGER ROSE SO HIGH AT THESE OBJECTIONS TILL AT LAST HIS PASSION COMPLETELY TAKING THE UPPER HAND HE STRUCK AT THEM RIGHT AND LEFT IN HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS STICK SOUNDED HEAVILY ON MORE THAN ONE
THREATENED HIM IN HORRID TERMS AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CATCH THE STICK AND WREST IT FROM HIS GRASP THIS QUARREL WAS THE SAVING OF US FOR WHILE IT WAS STILL RAGING ANOTHER SOUND CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THE SIDE OF THE HAMLET
YET I SAW NO OTHER PRESENTLY IT BROUGHT ME TO STONE UPRIGHTS WITH AN UNROOFED LODGE BESIDE THEM AND COATS OF ARMS UPON THE TOP A MAIN ENTRANCE IT WAS PLAINLY MEANT TO BE BUT NEVER FINISHED INSTEAD OF GATES OF WROUGHT IRON
FILLED IT IN IMAGINATION WITH GAY SUMMER GROUPS HE TRIED TO FORGET OLD BATTLE CLOUDS AND PICTURE ONLY CURLING WREATHS OF TOBACCO SMOKE RISING FROM AMONG MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENJOYING THEIR TEA AND COFFEE IN THE OPEN AIR
AND SHE WHEN I HAD PUT MY USUAL QUESTION TURNED SHARP ABOUT
I WAS IN FULL CAREER WHEN I HEARD THE COUGH RIGHT OVERHEAD AND JUMPING BACK AND LOOKING UP BEHELD A MAN'S HEAD IN A TALL NIGHTCAP AND THE BELL MOUTH OF A BLUNDERBUSS AT ONE OF THE FIRST STOREY WINDOWS IT'S LOADED
THERE WAS A FLAG UPON THE CASTLE AND SHIPS MOVING OR LYING ANCHORED IN THE FIRTH BOTH OF WHICH FOR AS FAR AWAY AS THEY WERE I COULD DISTINGUISH CLEARLY AND BOTH BROUGHT MY COUNTRY HEART INTO MY MOUTH PRESENTLY AFTER
SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT
FINE BROAD PROMENADES SHADED BY NOBLE TREES BORDER THE CANALS AND ADD TO THE RETIRED APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES BEHIND HEIGHTENING THE EFFECT OF SCHOLASTIC SECLUSION THAT SEEMS TO PERVADE THE PLACE
JUST THEN THE NOISE OF HORSES TOPPED THE RISE AND FOUR OR FIVE RIDERS CAME IN SIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SWEPT AT FULL GALLOP DOWN THE SLOPE
AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
AT THIS PEW SAW HIS ERROR TURNED WITH A SCREAM AND RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE DITCH INTO WHICH HE ROLLED BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN IN A SECOND AND MADE ANOTHER DASH NOW UTTERLY BEWILDERED RIGHT UNDER THE NEAREST OF THE COMING HORSES
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN DEFIANTLY
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
WHAT SAY I NOT MISTER EBENEZER
SCATTER LADS AND FIND EM SURE ENOUGH THEY LEFT THEIR GLIM HERE SAID THE FELLOW FROM THE WINDOW SCATTER AND FIND EM ROUT THE HOUSE OUT REITERATED PEW STRIKING WITH HIS STICK UPON THE ROAD
I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS THAT I COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER BUT STOOD STARING AY THE MAN RESUMED HE'LL BE DEAD NO DOUBT AND THAT'LL BE WHAT BRINGS YE CHAPPING TO MY DOOR
BY THIS TIME MY EARS HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE QUIET THAT I COULD HEAR THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK INSIDE AS IT SLOWLY COUNTED OUT THE SECONDS BUT WHOEVER WAS IN THAT HOUSE KEPT DEADLY STILL AND MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH
THE TRAMP OF HORSES GALLOPING ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME A PISTOL SHOT FLASH AND REPORT CAME FROM THE HEDGE SIDE AND THAT WAS PLAINLY THE LAST SIGNAL OF DANGER FOR THE BUCCANEERS TURNED AT ONCE AND RAN
WHAT KIND OF A GREAT HOUSE WAS THIS THAT ALL THE PARISH SHOULD START AND STARE TO BE ASKED THE WAY TO IT OR WHAT SORT OF A GENTLEMAN THAT HIS ILL FAME SHOULD BE THUS CURRENT ON THE WAYSIDE IF AN HOUR'S WALKING WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME BACK TO ESSENDEAN
SOME NEWS OF THE LUGGER IN KITT'S HOLE HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO SUPERVISOR DANCE AND SET HIM FORTH THAT NIGHT IN OUR DIRECTION AND TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MY MOTHER AND I OWED OUR PRESERVATION FROM DEATH PEW WAS DEAD
RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
ONE TAILING OUT BEHIND THE REST WAS A LAD THAT HAD GONE FROM THE HAMLET TO DOCTOR LIVESEY'S THE REST WERE REVENUE OFFICERS WHOM HE HAD MET BY THE WAY AND WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO RETURN AT ONCE
THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY NAME SAID I THEY CALL ME DAVID BALFOUR AT THAT I MADE SURE THE MAN STARTED
STONE DEAD AS FOR MY MOTHER WHEN WE HAD CARRIED HER UP TO THE HAMLET A LITTLE COLD WATER AND SALTS AND THAT SOON BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN AND SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR HER TERROR
BUT WHEN I HAD COME SO FAR A WAY ALREADY MERE SHAME WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO DESIST TILL I HAD PUT THE MATTER TO THE TOUCH OF PROOF I WAS BOUND OUT OF MERE SELF RESPECT TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND LITTLE AS I LIKED THE SOUND OF WHAT I HEARD
BEN AND LAMBERT HAD OFTEN VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SURPRISED AT THE RICHNESS OF THE LEYDEN COLLECTION THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS WEARING APPAREL WEAPONS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
COMING TO THE TOP OF A HILL I SAW ALL THE COUNTRY FALL AWAY BEFORE ME DOWN TO THE SEA AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESCENT ON A LONG RIDGE
IT BEWILDERS ONE TO LOOK AT THEM HELP ME TO COUNT ALL THOSE WE CAN SEE VAN MOUNEN I WANT A BIG ITEM FOR MY NOTEBOOK AND AFTER A CAREFUL RECKONING
AND A RUSH WAS MADE UPON THE ADMIRAL BENBOW THE LANTERN BEARER FOLLOWING AND THEN I COULD SEE THEM PAUSE AND HEAR SPEECHES PASSED IN A LOWER KEY AS IF THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM OBEYED AT ONCE TWO REMAINING ON THE ROAD WITH THE FORMIDABLE BEGGAR THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN A CRY OF SURPRISE AND THEN A VOICE SHOUTING FROM THE HOUSE BILL'S DEAD
SO IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN TO THE HOLE THE LUGGER WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY THOUGH STILL CLOSE IN HE HAILED HER A VOICE REPLIED TELLING HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT OR HE WOULD GET SOME LEAD IN HIM
AND ANOTHER READY TO FAINT BEN MANAGED TO TURN HIS HEAD HE SAW A CROWD OF BOYS ON THE EDGE OF THE WALL OPPOSITE BUT JACOB WAS NOT THERE GOOD HEAVENS HE CRIED SPRINGING FORWARD WHERE IS MY COUSIN
WAS THIS THE PALACE I HAD BEEN COMING TO WAS IT WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I WAS TO SEEK NEW FRIENDS AND BEGIN GREAT FORTUNES WHY IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ON ESSEN WATERSIDE
PETER AND JACOB REGARDED THE BUILDING WITH AN EVEN DEEPER MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR THEY WERE TO ENTER IT AS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS POOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD HAVE RUN A HOPELESS TILT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
THE BETTER TO SET THIS FEAR AT REST I CHANGED THE FORM OF MY INQUIRIES AND SPYING AN HONEST FELLOW COMING ALONG A LANE ON THE SHAFT OF HIS CART I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER HEARD TELL OF A HOUSE THEY CALLED THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
AND THEN RIGHT UP AGAINST THE YELLOW SKY I SAW A SCROLL OF SMOKE GO MOUNTING NOT MUCH THICKER AS IT SEEMED TO ME THAN THE SMOKE OF A CANDLE BUT STILL THERE IT WAS AND MEANT A FIRE AND WARMTH AND COOKERY
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER BUILDING AND HASTILY CLAPPED ON AS A FINISHING TOUCH
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IN HIS ADVENTURES AND IF THERE WASN'T THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOK AT THEM HOW FRANTICALLY THEY WHIRL THEIR GREAT ARMS JUST THE THING TO EXCITE THE CRAZY KNIGHT TO MORTAL COMBAT
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
HE STOPPED HIS CART AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE OTHERS AY SAID HE WHAT FOR IT'S A GREAT HOUSE I ASKED DOUBTLESS SAYS HE
THIS APPEAL SEEMED TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT FOR TWO OF THE FELLOWS BEGAN TO LOOK HERE AND THERE AMONG THE LUMBER BUT HALF HEARTEDLY I THOUGHT AND WITH HALF AN EYE TO THEIR OWN DANGER ALL THE TIME WHILE THE REST STOOD IRRESOLUTE ON THE ROAD
HE INTERRUPTED VERY CHEERILY PERFECTLY RIGHT A GENTLEMAN AND A MAGISTRATE AND NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT I MIGHT AS WELL RIDE ROUND THERE MYSELF AND REPORT TO HIM OR SQUIRE MASTER PEW'S DEAD WHEN ALL'S DONE
CRIES THE CARTER IN SO SHARP A NOTE THAT HIS VERY HORSE STARTED AND THEN WELL MANNIE HE ADDED IT'S NANE OF MY AFFAIRS BUT YE SEEM A DECENT SPOKEN LAD AND IF YE'LL TAKE A WORD FROM ME YE'LL KEEP CLEAR OF THE SHAWS
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
PROMPTLY AFTERWARDS FRESH SOUNDS OF ASTONISHMENT AROSE THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A SLAM AND A JINGLE OF BROKEN GLASS AND A MAN LEANED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND ADDRESSED THE BLIND BEGGAR ON THE ROAD BELOW HIM
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
THE FIRE AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD SHOW A MILE AWAY AND THE DOOR OPEN TO A BEGGAR'S KNOCK I CAME FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
HIM THEY HAD DESERTED WHETHER IN SHEER PANIC OR OUT OF REVENGE FOR HIS ILL WORDS AND BLOWS I KNOW NOT BUT THERE HE REMAINED BEHIND TAPPING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD IN A FRENZY AND GROPING AND CALLING FOR HIS COMRADES
AT THAT ANOTHER FELLOW PROBABLY HIM WHO HAD REMAINED BELOW TO SEARCH THE CAPTAIN'S BODY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE INN
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
THE PRIDE OF LIFE SEEMED TO MOUNT INTO MY BRAIN AT THE SIGHT OF THE RED COATS AND THE HEARING OF THAT MERRY MUSIC A LITTLE FARTHER ON
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED
OTHERS CROUCH BEFORE THE PUBLIC EDIFICES AND CHURCHES BEING CLEAN SPACIOUS WELL SHADED AND ADORNED WITH MANY ELEGANT MANSIONS
BUT THE PAUSE WAS BRIEF FOR THE BLIND MAN AGAIN ISSUED HIS COMMANDS HIS VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER AND HIGHER AS IF HE WERE AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS AND RAGE IN IN IN HE SHOUTED AND CURSED THEM FOR THEIR DELAY
IN THOSE DAYS FOLK STILL BELIEVED IN WITCHES AND TREMBLED AT A CURSE AND THIS ONE FALLING SO PAT LIKE A WAYSIDE OMEN TO ARREST ME ERE I CARRIED OUT MY PURPOSE TOOK THE PITH OUT OF MY LEGS
THE HOUSE IS A BIG MUCKLE HOUSE AY SAID I BUT THE FOLK THAT ARE IN IT FOLK CRIED HE
THE SAME WORLD RENOWNED RIVER DEGRADED FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FREE FLOWING RHINE SERVES AS A MOAT FROM THE RAMPART THAT SURROUNDS LEYDEN AND IS CROSSED BY DRAWBRIDGES AT THE IMPOSING GATEWAYS THAT GIVE ACCESS TO THE CITY
AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
AND I MADE OUT EVEN THROUGH THE MIST THAT THE MIDDLE MAN OF THIS TRIO WAS THE BLIND BEGGAR THE NEXT MOMENT HIS VOICE SHOWED ME THAT I WAS RIGHT DOWN WITH THE DOOR HE CRIED AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED TWO OR THREE
THIS OVER THE PARTY ONCE MORE PREPARED FOR SKATING
THAN THEY WERE IN THE FACT OF ITS BEING A TRIPTYCH THAT IS PAINTED ON THREE DIVISIONS THE TWO OUTER ONES SWUNG ON HINGES SO AS TO CLOSE WHEN REQUIRED OVER THE MAIN PORTION
AND POINTED TO A GREAT BULK OF BUILDING STANDING VERY BARE UPON A GREEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT VALLEY THE COUNTRY WAS PLEASANT ROUND ABOUT RUNNING IN LOW HILLS PLEASANTLY WATERED AND WOODED AND THE CROPS TO MY EYES WONDERFULLY GOOD
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF SPEECH AND NOT A DOG BARKED
AND WITH A CURIOUS CHANGE OF VOICE THAT THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED
CRIED THE VOICE SHARPLY I REPEATED WHAT I HAD SAID WHO ARE YE YOURSELF
CONTAINING PROFESSOR LUZAC'S MEMORIAL AND BOERHAAVE'S MONUMENT OF WHITE AND BLACK MARBLE WITH ITS URN AND CARVED SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE AND ITS MEDALLION OF BOERHAAVE ADORNED WITH HIS FAVORITE MOTTO
AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
AND FROM ITS EFFECT UPON THE BUCCANEERS A SIGNAL TO WARN THEM OF APPROACHING DANGER THERE'S DIRK AGAIN SAID ONE TWICE WE'LL HAVE TO BUDGE MATES
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO GET IT PUT IN SAFETY TO BE SURE BOY QUITE RIGHT SAID HE I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I THOUGHT PERHAPS DOCTOR LIVESEY I BEGAN PERFECTLY RIGHT
NO ROAD LED UP TO IT NO SMOKE AROSE FROM ANY OF THE CHIMNEYS NOR WAS THERE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A GARDEN MY HEART SANK THAT I CRIED THE WOMAN'S FACE LIT UP WITH A MALIGNANT ANGER
SAID A VOICE I HAVE COME HERE WITH A LETTER I SAID TO MISTER EBENEZER BALFOUR OF SHAWS IS HE HERE FROM WHOM IS IT ASKED THE MAN WITH THE BLUNDERBUSS THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
WHAT DO YOU SEE AND FOR MONTHS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER NO HELP I SEE AROUND US NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY BEN PUSHED THESE THOUGHTS AWAY AND RESOLUTELY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BARE TEA GARDEN
IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
I WAS IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RUN AWAY BUT ANGER GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I BEGAN INSTEAD TO RAIN KICKS AND BUFFETS ON THE DOOR
BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
SIMPLEX SIGILLUM VERI THEY ALSO OBTAINED ADMITTANCE TO A TEA GARDEN WHICH IN SUMMER WAS A FAVORITE RESORT OF THE CITIZENS AND PASSING NAKED OAKS AND FRUIT TREES
WHEN THE BOYS LEFT THIS MUSEUM THEY WENT TO ANOTHER AND SAW A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF FOSSIL ANIMALS SKELETONS BIRDS MINERALS PRECIOUS STONES AND OTHER NATURAL SPECIMENS
SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
BEN AS HE SCANNED THE BUILDINGS ON THE RAPENBURG CANAL WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN BUT WHEN HE RECALLED ITS HISTORY HOW ATTENDED WITH ALL THE POMP OF A GRAND CIVIC DISPLAY
PEW HE CRIED THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE US SOMEONE'S TURNED THE CHEST OUT ALOW AND ALOFT IS IT THERE ROARED PEW THE MONEY'S THERE THE BLIND MAN CURSED THE MONEY
AND WE WALKED BACK TO THE HAMLET WHERE THE HORSES WERE
IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AS A TRIBUTE TO THE CITIZENS FOR THE BRAVERY DISPLAYED DURING THE SIEGE WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE GREAT MEN IN RELIGION LEARNING AND SCIENCE WHO HAD ONCE STUDIED THERE
SAID BEN AFTER LAMBERT HAD BEEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ODDITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE SUBURBS IT IS ALL WINDMILLS YOU REMEMBER HIS TERRIFIC CONTEST WITH ONE I SUPPOSE NO SAID LAMBERT BLUNTLY
I CAME BY A HOUSE WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND GOT A ROUGH DIRECTION FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CRAMOND AND SO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WORKED MY WAY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE CAPITAL BY COLINTON TILL I CAME OUT UPON THE GLASGOW ROAD AND THERE TO MY GREAT PLEASURE AND WONDER
AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
AND I DID IT A BLIND MAN AND I'M TO LOSE MY CHANCE FOR YOU I'M TO BE A POOR CRAWLING BEGGAR SPONGING FOR RUM WHEN I MIGHT BE ROLLING IN A COACH
INTERESTED THEM FOR A WHILE AND BEN HAD TO BE ALMOST PULLED AWAY FROM THE DINGY OLD PORTRAIT OF VAN DER WERF THE TOWN HALL AS WELL AS THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IS ON THE BREEDSTRAAT THE LONGEST AND FINEST STREET IN LEYDEN
IT HAS NO CANAL RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE HOUSES PAINTED IN EVERY VARIETY OF COLOR HAVE A PICTURESQUE EFFECT AS THEY STAND WITH THEIR GABLE ENDS TO THE STREET SOME ARE VERY TALL WITH HALF THEIR HEIGHT IN THEIR STEP LIKE ROOFS
THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
THE AWFUL GERMAN LANGUAGE
AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA PAVLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD
FURTHER DISAGREEMENTS RECORDED ILLUSTRATING THE AMIABILITY OF THE JEW AND THE PERVERSITY OF THE SCOT IN TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT THE JEWS TO THE NUMBER OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE HANGED FOR HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION CLIPPED COINS
TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOM THAT DOES NOT EXIST
BRUCE SURPRISED THE CAVALRY WITH DEEP PITS AND BEFORE THE ENGLISH COULD RECOVER FROM THIS
NOT NECESSARY BUT PRETTY GERMAN BOOKS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO READ WHEN YOU HOLD THEM BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS OR STAND ON YOUR HEAD SO AS TO REVERSE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT I THINK
OF WHAT A PERPLEXING LANGUAGE IT IS SURELY THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT IS SO SLIPSHOD AND SYSTEMLESS AND SO SLIPPERY AND ELUSIVE TO THE GRASP ONE IS WASHED ABOUT IN IT
WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY
AND COMPLACENTLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA FIRST OF ALL DEAR FRIEND TELL ME HOW YOU ARE SET YOUR FRIEND'S MIND AT REST
AND REALLY YOU APPRECIATE THEM LESS THAN ANYONE AND SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THEM AND SHE SMILED HER ECSTATIC SMILE I CAN'T HELP IT SAID THE PRINCE
AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA YOU ARE STAYING THE WHOLE EVENING I HOPE
AND REMAIN IN JAIL THERE INSTEAD OF CAUSING A SCANDAL BY STAYING AWAY AND SPENDING HIS MONEY IN WALES HE WAS CONFINED IN KENILWORTH CASTLE WHILE HIS SON WAS OSTENSIBLY KING THOUGH HIS WIFE AND MORTIMER REALLY MANAGED THE KINGDOM
AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE
WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLY FOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTH CONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEW FOUNDATION
THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENT OR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE AND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED
THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN SENT INSTEAD OF OUR DEAR WINTZINGERODE YOU WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE KING OF PRUSSIA'S CONSENT BY ASSAULT YOU ARE SO ELOQUENT WILL YOU GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA IN A MOMENT
WHERE HE DIED IN BOUNDLESS OBSCURITY IN TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BALIOL WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE BRAVE WILLIAM WALLACE WHO WON A GREAT BATTLE AT STIRLING BUT WAS AFTERWARDS DEFEATED ENTIRELY AT FALKIRK
CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING MORE CONFUSING THAN THAT THESE THINGS ARE CALLED SEPARABLE VERBS THE GERMAN GRAMMAR IS BLISTERED ALL OVER WITH SEPARABLE VERBS AND THE WIDER
BUT I WARN YOU IF YOU DON'T TELL ME THAT THIS MEANS WAR IF YOU STILL TRY TO DEFEND THE INFAMIES AND HORRORS PERPETRATED BY THAT ANTICHRIST I REALLY BELIEVE HE IS ANTICHRIST I WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH YOU
HE MUST DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OR HE WILL BECOME DISLIKED AUTHOR
WITH BANNERS AND BAGPIPES AND THOUGH THEY WERE REALLY TEAMSTERS IN DISGUISE THEIR HOSTILE APPEARANCE AND THE DEPRESSING MUSIC OF THE BAGPIPES SO SHOCKED THE ENGLISH THAT THEY DID NOT STOP RUNNING UNTIL THEY REACHED BERWICK
THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED
BUT THE SCOTCH CALLED TO THEIR AID ROBERT BRUCE THE GRANDSON OF BALIOL'S COMPETITOR AND HE WAS SOLEMNLY CROWNED AT THE ABBEY OF SCONE DURING A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE PEOPLE EDWARD FELL SICK
THAT GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FULFILL HIS VOCATION AND CRUSH THE HYDRA OF REVOLUTION WHICH HAS BECOME MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER IN THE PERSON OF THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST ONE
ENGLAND WITH HER COMMERCIAL SPIRIT WILL NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S LOFTINESS OF SOUL SHE HAS REFUSED TO EVACUATE MALTA SHE WANTED TO FIND AND STILL SEEKS SOME SECRET MOTIVE IN OUR ACTIONS
SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON'T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES
DON'T TEASE WELL AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT NOVOSILTSEV'S DISPATCH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE PRINCE IN A COLD LISTLESS TONE WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
HE WOULD ALSO HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BREAK ANY COLLECTOR TO BUY IT HARRIS AND I HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ON OUR GERMAN DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AT THAT TIME AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS
FROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS OR OF CRIMES
WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SLIDING IT INTO THE ACCUSATIVE CASE
THINK OF THE RAGGED POVERTY OF A LANGUAGE WHICH HAS TO MAKE ONE WORD DO THE WORK OF SIX AND A POOR LITTLE WEAK THING OF ONLY THREE LETTERS AT THAT BUT MAINLY
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND THE MONUMENT IS FINISHED I SUPPOSE
WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
BUT LONGING TO LAY HER POOR ACHING HEAD YET ONCE AGAIN UPON THE BREAST OF HIM WHOM SHE LOVED MORE DEARLY THAN LIFE ITSELF PARTED HOWEVER IT IS NOT WELL
IT IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AFTER THINGS WHICH ARE OF NO SORT OF CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY WHERE IS THE BIRD NOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE BOOK IS
HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL
THE TEACHER LETS ME SOFTLY DOWN WITH THE REMARK THAT WHENEVER THE WORD
AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY'S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY
ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK
DROPS INTO A SENTENCE IT ALWAYS THROWS THAT SUBJECT INTO THE GENITIVE CASE REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES AND THEREFORE THIS BIRD STAYED IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I OFTEN THINK SHE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DRAWING NEARER TO THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
BY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MAN'S FREE WILL
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE LAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW
PHILIP THEN SUBPOENAED EDWARD AS DUKE OF GUIENNE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY HE SHOULD NOT PAY DAMAGES FOR THE LOSS OF THE NAVY WHICH COULD NOT BE REPLACED FOR LESS THAN TWENTY POUNDS AND FINALLY WHEEDLED EDWARD OUT OF THE DUCHY
AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
THE GRAMMATICAL HOROSCOPE OF THIS MATTER I ANSWER UP CONFIDENTLY AND STATE IN GERMAN THAT THE BIRD IS STAYING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM
TO DWELL TOO MUCH ON THE SEPARABLE VERBS ONE IS SURE TO LOSE HIS TEMPER EARLY AND IF HE STICKS TO THE SUBJECT AND WILL NOT BE WARNED IT WILL AT LAST EITHER SOFTEN HIS BRAIN
BUT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO ANYTHING BUT RAIN THERE ARE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEY ARE ALL TROUBLESOME AN AVERAGE SENTENCE IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
SHE HAS A BROTHER I THINK YOU KNOW HIM
TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
UNTIL HE JOTS DOWN AN INVENTORY OF THE WOMAN'S DRESS THAT IS MANIFESTLY ABSURD IT REMINDS A PERSON OF THOSE DENTISTS WHO SECURE YOUR INSTANT AND BREATHLESS INTEREST IN A TOOTH
UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGH THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS IN ASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING
SHE WAS AS SHE SAID SUFFERING FROM
WITH A SLIGHT PARENTHESIS IN IT I WILL MAKE A PERFECTLY LITERAL TRANSLATION AND THROW IN THE PARENTHESIS MARKS AND SOME HYPHENS FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE READER THOUGH IN THE ORIGINAL
NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA PAVLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON'T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS
IN SATIN AND SILK COVERED NOW VERY UNCONSTRAINED AFTER THE NEWEST FASHIONED DRESSED
THIS RAIN IS NOT RESTING BUT IS DOING SOMETHING ACTIVELY IT IS FALLING TO INTERFERE WITH THE BIRD LIKELY AND THIS INDICATES MOVEMENT
SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL THE NEWS IT WAS IN JULY EIGHTEEN O FIVE AND THE SPEAKER WAS THE WELL KNOWN ANNA PAVLOVNA SCHERER MAID OF HONOR AND FAVORITE OF THE EMPRESS MARYA FEDOROVNA WITH THESE WORDS SHE GREETED PRINCE VASILI KURAGIN
THE KING CAME AROUND TO BERWICK FROM DUNBAR BY STEAMER
HE IS THE WELL KNOWN PRINCE BOLKONSKI WHO HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE ARMY UNDER THE LATE EMPEROR AND WAS NICKNAMED THE KING OF PRUSSIA HE IS VERY CLEVER BUT ECCENTRIC AND A BORE THE POOR GIRL IS VERY UNHAPPY
IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
SAYS SIE TO ME I GENERALLY TRY TO KILL HIM
BENEATH THE POLITENESS AND AFFECTED SYMPATHY OF WHICH INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IRONY COULD BE DISCERNED CAN ONE BE WELL WHILE SUFFERING MORALLY CAN ONE BE CALM IN TIMES LIKE THESE IF ONE HAS ANY FEELING
AND ROBERT BRUCE WAS BESIEGING THE LATTER THE ENGLISH NUMBERING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT BANNOCKBURN FOUGHT AGAINST THIRTY THOUSAND SCOTS
IN HISTORY IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY FREE WILL AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH LAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTH'S FIXITY
PHILIP MAINTAINED A SECRET UNDERSTANDING WITH BALIOL HOWEVER AND EDWARD CALLED A PARLIAMENT FOUNDED UPON THE GREAT PRINCIPLE THAT WHAT CONCERNS ALL SHOULD BE APPROVED BY ALL
ON THE OTHER IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN GOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AN ATTRACTIVE TRIFLER NAMED GAVESTON DAWDLED AWAY HIS DAYS AND FRITTERED AWAY HIS NIGHTS FINALLY THE NOBLES WHO DISLIKED GAVESTON CAPTURED HIM AND PUT HIM IN WARWICK CASTLE
WEARING AN EMBROIDERED COURT UNIFORM KNEE BREECHES AND SHOES AND HAD STARS ON HIS BREAST AND A SERENE EXPRESSION ON HIS FLAT FACE HE SPOKE IN THAT REFINED FRENCH IN WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS NOT ONLY SPOKE BUT THOUGHT
THAT IS FROM THE OLD MAMSELLE'S SECRET BY MISSUS MARLITT AND THAT SENTENCE IS CONSTRUCTED UPON THE MOST APPROVED GERMAN MODEL YOU OBSERVE
IN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER ON BOTH SIDES THE STRUGGLE PROVOKES PASSION AND STIFLES TRUTH ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS FEAR AND REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES
THINK OF THE EXASPERATION OF NEVER KNOWING WHICH OF THESE MEANINGS THE SPEAKER IS TRYING TO CONVEY THIS EXPLAINS WHY
IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN UNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY
THERE ARE NO PARENTHESIS MARKS OR HYPHENS AND THE READER IS LEFT TO FLOUNDER THROUGH TO THE REMOTE VERB THE BEST WAY HE CAN BUT WHEN HE UPON THE STREET THE
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
DESPITE HER FORTY YEARS OVERFLOWED WITH ANIMATION AND IMPULSIVENESS TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST HAD BECOME HER SOCIAL VOCATION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT SHE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC
WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
AND WHY ARE CHILDREN BORN TO SUCH MEN AS YOU IF YOU WERE NOT A FATHER THERE WOULD BE NOTHING I COULD REPROACH YOU WITH SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA LOOKING UP PENSIVELY I AM YOUR FAITHFUL SLAVE
THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
I BEGIN TO CIPHER OUT THE GERMAN FOR THAT ANSWER I BEGIN AT THE WRONG END NECESSARILY FOR THAT IS THE GERMAN IDEA I SAY TO MYSELF
I SHALL BE VERY CHARMED TO SEE YOU TONIGHT BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN ANNETTE SCHERER HEAVENS WHAT A VIRULENT ATTACK REPLIED THE PRINCE NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED BY THIS RECEPTION HE HAD JUST ENTERED
WHENEVER TIMES WERE HARD THE JEWS WERE IMPRISONED AND ON ONE JOB LOT ALONE TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS WERE REALIZED IN RANSOM AND STILL THE JEWS ARE NOT YET CONSIDERED AS AMONG THE REDEEMED IN TWELVE NINETY
EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF NOW ON THE VERGE OF OPEN WAR WITH IRELAND AND WALES
JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY STANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTING REVELATION
IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTY AND ANNOYANCE FOR THREE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD DIED IN THE MEAN TIME A PERSON WHO HAS NOT STUDIED GERMAN CAN FORM NO IDEA
HAS TO PERFORM THE NOBLEST ROLE ON EARTH
AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONSOLE HIM SO SHE SAID NOW ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN ENRAPTURED BY HER
ARE MASSED TOGETHER BETWEEN A COUPLE OF KING PARENTHESES ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE MAJESTIC SENTENCE AND THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST LINE OF IT
WITH THE FORCEPS AND THEN STAND THERE AND DRAWL THROUGH A TEDIOUS ANECDOTE BEFORE THEY GIVE THE DREADED JERK
SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE PHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY
AND PERCEPTION BEFITTING A MAN OF THE WORLD HE INDICATED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION DO YOU KNOW HE SAID AT LAST
IT NECESSARILY CAN'T BE CLEARNESS EVEN A JURY WOULD HAVE PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT A WRITER'S IDEAS MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CONFUSED A GOOD DEAL OUT OF LINE AND SEQUENCE
FOR IF A CERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHIC ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
THAT TO LEARN TO READ AND UNDERSTAND A GERMAN NEWSPAPER IS A THING WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO A FOREIGNER YET EVEN THE GERMAN BOOKS ARE NOT ENTIRELY FREE
LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
THAT IT IS NO MOONLIGHT FROLIC EDWARD FLED TO WALES
BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH
THEY ORGANIZED A SCHEME TO THROW OFF THE SPENCERS AND DETHRONE EDWARD THE THINKLESS
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOUR PRODIGAL SON ANATOLE SHE ASKED THEY SAY OLD MAIDS HAVE A MANIA FOR MATCHMAKING AND THOUGH I DON'T FEEL THAT WEAKNESS IN MYSELF AS YET
BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROFITS THE FOLLOWING YEAR EDWARD MARCHED INTO SCOTLAND
HE RAISED THE MAID OF HONOR'S HAND TO HIS LIPS KISSED IT AND SWUNG IT TO AND FRO AS HE LAY BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ATTENDEZ SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA REFLECTING
VERY RARE POSSIBLY A UNIQUE AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO HIS MUSEUM IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT IT HAD COST ME TO ACQUIRE MY ART
THIS WAS IN TWELVE NINETY FIVE AND ON THIS DECLARATION
AFTER HAVING BEEN MOST INHUMANLY TREATED IN BERKELEY CASTLE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN REMOVED THUS ENDS THE SAD HISTORY OF A MONARCH WHO MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A MINOR POSITION ON A HEN FARM BUT WHO MADE A BEASTLY FLUKE IN THE KING BUSINESS
AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS
AND IN THIRTEEN TWELVE THE ROYAL FAVORITE WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND NEAR HIM A LARGE POOL OF BLOOD AND ON A FURTHER SEARCH DISCOVERED HIS OWN HEAD LYING IN THE GUTTER OF THE COURT TURNING SICK AT THE GORY SIGHT
OR HAUGWITZ EITHER THIS FAMOUS PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY IS JUST A TRAP I HAVE FAITH ONLY IN GOD AND THE LOFTY DESTINY OF OUR ADORED MONARCH HE WILL SAVE EUROPE
AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME IS NOT GIVEN
LISTEN DEAR ANNETTE SAID THE PRINCE SUDDENLY TAKING ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND FOR SOME REASON DRAWING IT DOWNWARDS ARRANGE THAT AFFAIR FOR ME AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR MOST DEVOTED SLAVE
INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
AND FINDS THAT THERE ARE MORE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THAN INSTANCES OF IT SO OVERBOARD HE GOES AGAIN TO HUNT FOR ANOTHER ARARAT AND FIND ANOTHER QUICKSAND SUCH HAS BEEN
BUT EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS
A PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART
N B I WAS INFORMED LATER BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION WHICH PERMITS ONE TO SAY
IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILT WERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCE
AND YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FRIEND NO LONGER MY FAITHFUL SLAVE AS YOU CALL YOURSELF BUT HOW DO YOU DO
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
SAID THE OWL SH THERE IT IS AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR THAT NO I DO NOT SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT KIND OF A SOUND IS IT
EVERYBODY QUITE STILL SHUT YOUR EYES AND DON'T BREATHE TOO TOO LEANED DOWN AND LISTENED AGAIN VERY HARD AND LONG AT LAST HE LOOKED UP INTO THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND SAID
AND THE PICTURE OF AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM HE WAS A STRONG MAN A KIND UNCLE AND THE BEST SAILOR IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC HIS FISHING BOAT WAS CALLED THE SAUCY SALLY A CUTTER RIGGED SLOOP
THE ROOM WAS QUITE SMALL NO WINDOW THE CEILING LOW FOR FURNITURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE STOOL
SO THEY ALL CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND JIP PEERED THROUGH THE KEY HOLE BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING WHILE THEY WERE STANDING AROUND WONDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THE OWL
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
AND CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING SUCH EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE AS TO BELIEVE THAT IF AMONG THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN AS MEN THERE IS ANY ONE REALLY EXCELLENT AND IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN AFTER ALL IT IS POSSIBLE I MAY BE MISTAKEN
FOR MYSELF I HAVE NEVER FANCIED MY MIND TO BE IN ANY RESPECT MORE PERFECT THAN THOSE OF THE GENERALITY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I WERE EQUAL TO SOME OTHERS IN PROMPTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR IN CLEARNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF IMAGINATION
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
DOES NOT ARISE FROM SOME BEING ENDOWED WITH A LARGER SHARE OF REASON THAN OTHERS BUT SOLELY FROM THIS THAT WE CONDUCT OUR THOUGHTS ALONG DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO NOT FIX OUR ATTENTION ON THE SAME OBJECTS
AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
IN A CONDITION WHICH COMPELLED ME TO MAKE MERCHANDISE OF SCIENCE FOR THE BETTERING OF MY FORTUNE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO SCORN GLORY AS A CYNIC
SO THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THE STUDY CONSISTED IN THIS THAT OBSERVING MANY THINGS WHICH HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND RIDICULOUS TO OUR APPREHENSION
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY MAY YET MAKE FAR GREATER PROGRESS PROVIDED THEY KEEP ALWAYS TO THE STRAIGHT ROAD THAN THOSE WHO WHILE THEY RUN FORSAKE IT
WHAT I'M DOING NOW
COME DOWN AND SEE IF YOU CAN LET US IN SO THE DOCTOR WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS INDEED A BEAUTIFUL SHIP HE FOUND THE ANIMALS GATHERED ROUND A LITTLE DOOR ALL TALKING AT ONCE TRYING TO GUESS WHAT WAS INSIDE
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
NOW HE PUSHES HIS HAIR BACK OFF HIS FOREHEAD IT'S A MAN ALL RIGHT WOMEN SOMETIMES DO THAT SAID THE DOCTOR TRUE SAID THE OWL
EVERYTHING MAKES SOME NOISE IF YOUR EARS ARE ONLY SHARP ENOUGH TO CATCH IT BATS CAN HEAR A MOLE WALKING IN HIS TUNNEL UNDER THE EARTH
THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
TO HOLD IN ESTEEM THE STUDIES OF THE SCHOOLS I WAS AWARE THAT THE LANGUAGES TAUGHT IN THEM ARE NECESSARY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE GRACE OF FABLE STIRS THE MIND THAT THE MEMORABLE DEEDS OF HISTORY ELEVATE IT AND
AND NOTHING THEREFORE WHICH IS ABOVE DOUBT I DID NOT PRESUME TO ANTICIPATE THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE GREATER IN IT THAN THAT OF OTHERS AND FURTHER WHEN I CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF CONFLICTING OPINIONS TOUCHING A SINGLE MATTER
THE ANIMALS ALL WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEIR NEW BOAT WAS LIKE INSIDE WHILE THE DOCTOR LEANT ON THE RAIL AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING THE CANARY ISLANDS FADE AWAY IN THE BLUE DUSK OF THE EVENING
THERE ARE THICK SOFT CARPETS ON THE FLOORS THE DISHES ARE MADE OF SILVER AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK SPECIAL THINGS
AFTER A MOMENT TOO TOO SAID
HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
AND THE ISSUE OF WHICH MUST PRESENTLY PUNISH HIM IF HE HAS JUDGED AMISS THAN IN THOSE CONDUCTED BY A MAN OF LETTERS IN HIS STUDY REGARDING SPECULATIVE MATTERS THAT ARE OF NO PRACTICAL MOMENT AND FOLLOWED BY NO CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF FARTHER PERHAPS
IF THE POOR FELLOW'S UNHAPPY WE'VE GOT TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
THAT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD ADVANCED NO FARTHER IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING THAN THE DISCOVERY AT EVERY TURN OF MY OWN IGNORANCE AND YET I WAS STUDYING IN ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOOLS IN EUROPE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE LEARNED MEN
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
BUT I SHALL ENDEAVOR IN THIS DISCOURSE TO DESCRIBE THE PATHS I HAVE FOLLOWED AND TO DELINEATE MY LIFE AS IN A PICTURE IN ORDER THAT EACH ONE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THEM FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IN THE GENERAL OPINION ENTERTAINED OF THEM AS GATHERED FROM CURRENT REPORT
FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
IF SUCH WERE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ALL THAT OTHERS LEARNED THERE AND NOT CONTENTED WITH THE SCIENCES ACTUALLY TAUGHT US I HAD IN ADDITION READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS
WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS METAPHYSIC IN THE FIFTH THE ORDER OF THE PHYSICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE HAS INVESTIGATED AND IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLICATION OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND OF SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO MEDICINE
FOR TO BE POSSESSED OF A VIGOROUS MIND IS NOT ENOUGH THE PRIME REQUISITE IS RIGHTLY TO APPLY IT THE GREATEST MINDS AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCES ARE OPEN LIKEWISE TO THE GREATEST ABERRATIONS
BUT THEY GIVE US NO ADEQUATE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND FREQUENTLY THAT WHICH THEY DESIGNATE WITH SO FINE A NAME IS BUT APATHY OR PRIDE OR DESPAIR OR PARRICIDE I REVERED OUR THEOLOGY AND ASPIRED AS MUCH AS ANY ONE TO REACH HEAVEN
BUT WHEN THEY DO THEIR LONG HAIR MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENT SOUND
I ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE STUDY OF LETTERS AND RESOLVED NO LONGER TO SEEK ANY OTHER SCIENCE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF OR OF THE GREAT BOOK OF THE WORLD I SPENT THE REMAINDER OF MY YOUTH IN TRAVELING IN VISITING COURTS AND ARMIES
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
ON THE OTHER HAND I COMPARED THE DISQUISITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORALISTS TO VERY TOWERING AND MAGNIFICENT PALACES WITH NO BETTER FOUNDATION THAN SAND AND MUD THEY LAUD THE VIRTUES VERY HIGHLY AND EXHIBIT THEM AS ESTIMABLE FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
I ESTEEMED ELOQUENCE HIGHLY AND WAS IN RAPTURES WITH POESY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BOTH WERE GIFTS OF NATURE RATHER THAN FRUITS OF STUDY THOSE IN WHOM THE FACULTY OF REASON IS PREDOMINANT AND WHO MOST SKILLFULLY DISPOSE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THEM CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
SH THE DOCTOR WHISPERED THAT IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU DON'T LET HIM SEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HE GETS SO DREADFULLY EMBARRASSED TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LOCKED UP IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
I WILL NOT HESITATE HOWEVER TO AVOW MY BELIEF THAT IT HAS BEEN MY SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE VERY EARLY IN LIFE FALLEN IN WITH CERTAIN TRACKS WHICH HAVE CONDUCTED ME TO CONSIDERATIONS AND MAXIMS OF WHICH I HAVE FORMED A METHOD THAT GIVES ME THE MEANS AS I THINK
AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
THE MAN IN THERE IS UNHAPPY HE WEEPS HE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO BLUBBER OR SNIFFLE LEST WE SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE IS CRYING BUT I HEARD
THE DOCTOR TURNED THE HANDLE BUT IT WOULDN'T OPEN THEN THEY ALL STARTED TO HUNT FOR THE KEY THEY LOOKED UNDER THE MAT
WHICH IS PROPERLY WHAT IS CALLED GOOD SENSE OR REASON IS BY NATURE EQUAL IN ALL MEN
AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
I JUDGED THAT NO SOLID SUPERSTRUCTURES COULD BE REARED ON FOUNDATIONS SO INFIRM AND NEITHER THE HONOR NOR THE GAIN HELD OUT BY THEM WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ME TO THEIR CULTIVATION FOR I WAS NOT THANK HEAVEN
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
NOW ALL HOLD YOUR BREATH A MOMENT SO I CAN LISTEN WELL
I WAS THUS LED TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING OF ALL OTHER MEN BY MYSELF AND OF CONCLUDING THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS OF SUCH A NATURE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE I STILL CONTINUED HOWEVER
AS WELL AS FURTHER ALL THE ARTS AN LESSEN THE LABOUR OF MAN THAT NUMEROUS HIGHLY USEFUL PRECEPTS AND EXHORTATIONS TO VIRTUE ARE CONTAINED IN TREATISES ON MORALS THAT THEOLOGY POINTS OUT THE PATH TO HEAVEN
I MYSELF MAY HAVE A NEW HELP TOWARDS INSTRUCTION TO BE ADDED TO THOSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING MY PRESENT DESIGN THEN IS NOT TO TEACH THE METHOD WHICH EACH OUGHT TO FOLLOW FOR THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF HIS REASON
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER COMPETENTLY TO UNDERTAKE THEIR EXAMINATION THERE WAS NEED OF SOME SPECIAL HELP FROM HEAVEN AND OF BEING MORE THAN MAN
AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
AND SAID THEY WOULD THROW MY UNCLE INTO THE SEA IF HE DIDN'T DO AS THEY SAID THEY SENT ME DOWNSTAIRS AND I HEARD THE NOISE OF A FIGHT GOING ON ABOVE AND WHEN THEY LET ME COME UP AGAIN NEXT DAY
SIX WINE GLASSES WITH TURQUOISE AND SILVER ROUND THE RIMS AND A LOVELY GREAT SUGAR BOWL MADE OF MOTHER O PEARL BUT NOWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOAT COULD THEY FIND A KEY TO FIT THAT LOCK
IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
BUT BEING GIVEN ASSUREDLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY IS NOT LESS OPEN TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAN TO THE MOST LEARNED AND THAT THE REVEALED TRUTHS WHICH LEAD TO HEAVEN ARE ABOVE OUR COMPREHENSION I DID NOT PRESUME TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE IMPOTENCY OF MY REASON
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY UNCLE FOR ME WELL WE ARE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD SAID THE DOCTOR NOW WHAT WAS YOUR UNCLE LIKE TO LOOK AT HE HAD RED HAIR THE BOY ANSWERED VERY RED HAIR
GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S SOME ONE IN THERE THEY ALL KEPT STILL A MOMENT THEN THE DOCTOR SAID YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN TOO TOO I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
MY UNCLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I ASKED THE PIRATES WHERE HE WAS BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY THREW HIM INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED HIM
WE BECOME STRANGERS TO OUR NATIVE COUNTRY AND THE OVER CURIOUS IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE PAST ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THOSE OF THE PRESENT BESIDES FICTITIOUS NARRATIVES LEAD US TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF MANY EVENTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE
THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING THANKED THE SHARKS AGAIN FOR THEIR KINDNESS THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS SET OFF ONCE MORE ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME IN THE SWIFT SHIP WITH THE THREE RED SAILS AS THEY MOVED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
BUT I HAD NOT AS YET A PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR TRUE USE AND THINKING THAT THEY BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS I WAS ASTONISHED THAT FOUNDATIONS SO STRONG AND SOLID SHOULD HAVE HAD NO LOFTIER SUPERSTRUCTURE REARED ON THEM
BUT SOLELY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CONDUCT MY OWN THEY WHO SET THEMSELVES TO GIVE PRECEPTS MUST OF COURSE REGARD THEMSELVES AS POSSESSED OF GREATER SKILL THAN THOSE TO WHOM THEY PRESCRIBE
IN MAKING SUCH REFLECTION ON THE MATTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS TO SECURE MY IMPROVEMENT FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD FIND MUCH MORE TRUTH IN THE REASONINGS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED
TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED
AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
OR IN FULLNESS AND READINESS OF MEMORY AND BESIDES THESE I KNOW OF NO OTHER QUALITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECTION OF THE MIND
LISTEN AGAIN AND TELL ME WHAT HE'S DOING NOW I'M NOT SURE YET SAID TOO TOO IF IT'S A MAN AT ALL MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN
AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
THE PIRATES SHUT ME IN THERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING OFF TO STEAL THINGS FROM ANOTHER SHIP WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE CHOPPING ON THE DOOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS YOU
SAID JIP IN A WHISPER YES VERY RUM SAID GUB GUB THE SMELL MAKES ME GIDDY
BUT WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN HE HASN'T BEEN DROWNED IN THE SEA SO THE DOCTOR RAN DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE NEWS AND TOLD THE NEPHEW WHO CLAPPED HIS HANDS WITH HAPPINESS AND THE PUSHMI PULLYU TOOK THE LITTLE BOY ON HIS BACK AND GAVE HIM A RIDE ROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE
PARDON ME BUT I CAN SAID TOO TOO I TELL YOU THERE IS SOME ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET ALMOST
LIFT ME UP AND LET ME LISTEN AT THE KEY HOLE AND I'LL SOON TELL YOU
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
THE IMPOSTURES OF A MAGICIAN OR BY THE ARTIFICES AND BOASTING OF ANY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT FOR THESE REASONS AS SOON AS MY AGE PERMITTED ME TO PASS FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF MY INSTRUCTORS
OF GRADUALLY AUGMENTING MY KNOWLEDGE AND OF RAISING IT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO THE HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE MEDIOCRITY OF MY TALENTS AND THE BRIEF DURATION OF MY LIFE WILL PERMIT ME TO REACH FOR I HAVE ALREADY REAPED FROM IT SUCH FRUITS THAT
ASKED THE PORPOISES YES SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S THE MAN HAS HE BEEN DROWNED
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
I LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN TOO DECIDED A BELIEF IN REGARD TO NOTHING OF THE TRUTH OF WHICH I HAD BEEN PERSUADED MERELY BY EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND THUS
AND THEY DID EVEN AS HE HAD SAID THEY WENT TO THE STORE ROOM WHICH THEY ENTERED BEFORE MELANTHIUS SAW THEM FOR HE WAS BUSY SEARCHING FOR ARMS IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE ROOM SO THE TWO TOOK THEIR STAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AND WAITED
HE WAS TO BE THE FIRST THAT SHOULD TASTE OF THE ARROWS FROM THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHOM HE WAS DISHONOURING IN HIS OWN HOUSE
YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
MY FRIENDS THIS MAN WILL GIVE US NO QUARTER
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
SHE THEN WENT WITH HER MAIDENS INTO THE STORE ROOM AT THE END OF THE HOUSE WHERE HER HUSBAND'S TREASURES OF GOLD BRONZE AND WROUGHT IRON WERE KEPT AND WHERE WAS ALSO HIS BOW AND THE QUIVER FULL OF DEADLY ARROWS THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY A FRIEND
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND AND STILL EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE KILLED THEN ULYSSES SEARCHED THE WHOLE COURT CAREFULLY OVER TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD MANAGED TO HIDE HIMSELF AND WAS STILL LIVING
AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
HIS TABLE THE CUP AND ALL THE MEATS WENT OVER ON TO THE GROUND AS HE SMOTE THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD IN THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND HE KICKED THE STOOL WITH HIS FEET UNTIL HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN DARKNESS
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
ANTINOUS SAID SHE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD ILL TREAT ANY GUEST OF TELEMACHUS WHO COMES TO THIS HOUSE IF THE STRANGER SHOULD PROVE STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES
THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
O SWINEHERD EUMAEUS SAYING MELANTHIUS YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT ON A SOFT BED AS YOU DESERVE
THAT ARE OVER AGAINST ELIS WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO LET ANY ONE HAVE THE BOW OR TO REFUSE IT NO ONE SHALL FORCE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOT EVEN THOUGH I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE STRANGER A PRESENT OF THE BOW OUTRIGHT AND LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY WITH HIM
IF YOU ARE ULYSSES SAID HE THEN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS JUST WE HAVE DONE MUCH WRONG ON YOUR LANDS AND IN YOUR HOUSE
WHO WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THE OFFENDING LIES LOW ALREADY IT WAS ALL HIS DOING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY PENELOPE HE DID NOT SO MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND JOVE
BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
HAS NOT VOUCHSAFED IT TO HIM HE WANTED TO KILL YOUR SON AND TO BE CHIEF MAN IN ITHACA NOW THEREFORE THAT HE HAS MET THE DEATH WHICH WAS HIS DUE SPARE THE LIVES OF YOUR PEOPLE
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY MUST NOT COME OUT THEY MUST KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK AND I CHARGE YOU
THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES
IT IS TIME FOR THE ACHAEANS TO PREPARE SUPPER WHILE THERE IS STILL DAYLIGHT AND THEN OTHERWISE TO DISPORT THEMSELVES WITH SONG AND DANCE WHICH ARE THE CROWNING ORNAMENTS OF A BANQUET
AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
IF APOLLO AND THE OTHER GODS WILL GRANT OUR PRAYER YOUR OWN BOARHOUNDS SHALL GET YOU INTO SOME QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND WORRY YOU TO DEATH EUMAEUS WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE OUTCRY THEY ALL RAISED
WHO WAS ABOUT TO TAKE UP A TWO HANDLED GOLD CUP TO DRINK HIS WINE AND ALREADY HAD IT IN HIS HANDS HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEATH WHO AMONGST ALL THE REVELLERS WOULD THINK THAT ONE MAN HOWEVER BRAVE
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
SO THEY MADE ME TELEMACHUS HEARD HIM
BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
SHE WENT WONDERING BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND LAID HER SON'S SAYING IN HER HEART THEN GOING UPSTAIRS WITH HER HANDMAIDS INTO HER ROOM SHE MOURNED HER DEAR HUSBAND TILL MINERVA SENT SWEET SLEEP OVER HER EYELIDS
AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
SO HE PUT THE BOW DOWN THEN AND THERE BUT TELEMACHUS SHOUTED OUT AT HIM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLOISTERS AND THREATENED HIM SAYING FATHER EUMAEUS BRING THE BOW ON IN SPITE OF THEM
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
FOR THEY FEARED HE MIGHT STRING THE BOW ANTINOUS THEREFORE REBUKED HIM FIERCELY SAYING WRETCHED CREATURE YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A GRAIN OF SENSE IN YOUR WHOLE BODY YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
SO EUMAEUS BROUGHT THE BOW ON AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE CALLED EURYCLEA APART AND SAID TO HER
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
THIS DONE HE WENT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW THRICE DID HE TUG AT IT TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO DRAW THE STRING AND THRICE HE HAD TO LEAVE OFF
AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW AND GET THIS CONTEST SETTLED ON THIS HE PUT THE BOW DOWN LETTING IT LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE HOUSE WITH THE ARROW STANDING AGAINST THE TOP OF THE BOW
THERE WAS A SHIP'S CABLE OF BYBLUS FIBRE LYING IN THE GATEHOUSE SO HE MADE THE GATES FAST WITH IT AND THEN CAME IN AGAIN RESUMING THE SEAT THAT HE HAD LEFT AND KEEPING AN EYE ON ULYSSES WHO HAD NOW GOT THE BOW IN HIS HANDS
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY CLEANED ALL THE TABLES AND SEATS WITH SPONGES AND WATER WHILE TELEMACHUS AND THE TWO OTHERS SHOVELLED UP THE BLOOD AND DIRT FROM THE GROUND AND THE WOMEN CARRIED IT ALL AWAY
BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
IN BEING ALLOWED TO DINE UNHARMED AMONG YOUR BETTERS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SMALLER PORTION SERVED YOU THAN WE OTHERS HAVE HAD AND IN BEING ALLOWED TO HEAR OUR CONVERSATION
AT THIS MOMENT THE BOW
NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH HIM BY ULYSSES WHEN HE SAILED FOR TROY HE HAD USED IT SO LONG AS HE HAD BEEN AT HOME BUT HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AS HAVING BEEN A KEEPSAKE FROM A VALUED FRIEND
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
THAN THAT YOU WANT TO MARRY ME THIS THEN BEING THE PRIZE THAT YOU ARE CONTENDING FOR I WILL BRING OUT THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES AND WHOMSOEVER OF YOU SHALL STRING IT MOST EASILY
BUT KILLED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND KEPT THE MARES HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN CLAIMING THESE
HE SHED THE ARROWS ON TO THE GROUND AT HIS FEET AND SAID THE MIGHTY CONTEST IS AT AN END I WILL NOW SEE WHETHER APOLLO WILL VOUCHSAFE IT TO ME TO HIT ANOTHER MARK WHICH NO MAN HAS YET HIT
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
GET SPONGES AND CLEAN WATER TO SWILL DOWN THE TABLES AND SEATS WHEN YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED THE WHOLE CLOISTERS TAKE THE WOMEN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOMED ROOM AND THE WALL OF THE OUTER COURT AND RUN THEM THROUGH WITH YOUR SWORDS
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
THE TWO FELL IN WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MESSENE AT THE HOUSE OF ORTILOCHUS
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
THEN CAUGHT THE KNEES OF ULYSSES AND SAID ULYSSES I BESEECH YOU HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND SPARE ME
WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
AND ARMED HIMSELF FIRST WHILE THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD ALSO PUT ON THEIR ARMOUR AND TOOK THEIR PLACES NEAR ULYSSES MEANWHILE ULYSSES AS LONG AS HIS ARROWS LASTED HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE SUITORS ONE BY ONE
THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THEIR OFFERINGS AND HAD DRUNK EACH AS MUCH AS HE DESIRED ULYSSES CRAFTILY SAID SUITORS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN LISTEN THAT I MAY SPEAK EVEN AS I AM MINDED
HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
BY KILLING US OUTRIGHT THEY THEREFORE AIMED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THREW THEIR SPEARS ULYSSES KILLED DEMOPTOLEMUS TELEMACHUS EURYADES EUMAEUS ELATUS
GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
FOR SOME GOD HAS BEEN SENDING HER TO SLEEP DO NOT WAKE HER YET ANSWERED ULYSSES BUT TELL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES TO COME TO ME
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
HOLD HE CRIED THE MAN IS GUILTLESS DO HIM NO HURT AND WE WILL SPARE MEDON TOO WHO WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME WHEN I WAS A BOY UNLESS
COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
YET I AM LAUGHING AND ENJOYING MYSELF AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING HAPPENING BUT SUITORS AS THE CONTEST HAS BEEN AGREED UPON LET IT GO FORWARD IT IS FOR A WOMAN WHOSE PEER IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN PYLOS
FROM WHAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE AND THE SUITORS WARMED THE BOW AND AGAIN MADE TRIAL OF IT BUT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM NEARLY STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING IT NEVERTHELESS
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
ABOVE HIS SHIELD BUT THE SPEAR WENT ON AND FELL TO THE GROUND THEN ULYSSES AND HIS MEN LET DRIVE INTO THE CROWD OF SUITORS
BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
THEY SURELY DO NOT COMPLAIN OF YOUR WISE AND GRACIOUS RULE NO BUT THEY SAY IT IS A POOR RULE THAT DON'T WORK BOTH WAYS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW AND THESE FEMALES ARE ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT MEN HAVE RULED THE LAND LONG ENOUGH
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
NOR WAS THE SAW HORSE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATION EITHER FOR HE GROWLED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BEING BUTCHERED AS HE CALLED IT AND AFTERWARD DECLARED THAT THE NEW LEG WAS A DISGRACE TO A RESPECTABLE SAW HORSE
I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
NOT EXACTLY REPLIED THE SCARECROW FOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME
IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
AND ARE RUNNING THINGS TO SUIT THEMSELVES DEAR ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA CRIED THE EMPEROR WHO WAS BOTH SHOCKED
CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
SCARECROW BECAME GREATLY ANIMATED AT THIS SIGHT AND EXCLAIMED HOW DELIGHTED I SHALL BE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AGAIN
SAID THE TIN WOODMAN TAKING UP THE SCARECROW'S HEAD AND CARESSING IT TENDERLY
THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
I'M SURE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME REPLIED THE BOY THE SAW HORSE NOW AMBLED FORWARD AT A PACE SO FAST THAT ITS RIDERS HAD HARD WORK TO STICK UPON ITS BACK SO THERE WAS LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
NOW MY BOY YOU MUST MOUNT FIRST AND PLEASE SIT AS CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S NECK AS POSSIBLE TIP CLIMBED QUICKLY TO HIS PLACE AND THE SOLDIER AND THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO HOIST THE PUMPKINHEAD TO A SEAT JUST BEHIND HIM
IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN
BUT OUR FRIEND THE WOGGLE BUG CLAIMS TO BE HIGHLY EDUCATED SO HE OUGHT EASILY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EDUCATION
AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
CRIED TO THE TIN WOODMAN TO SAVE HIM AND THAT GOOD FRIEND RESPONDED WITH RENEWED ENERGY HIS AXE FAIRLY FLASHED AMONG THE JACKDAWS AND FORTUNATELY THE GUMP BEGAN WILDLY WAVING THE TWO WINGS REMAINING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS BODY
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
YES SAID TIP
LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE HERE THAT TERRIBLE SAW HORSE RAN AWAY WITH ME I SUSPECTED IT SAID TIP DID YOU GET HURT ARE YOU CRACKED AT ALL
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
YOUR MAJESTY THE CITY IS CONQUERED GASPED THE ROYAL ARMY WHO WAS ALL OUT OF BREATH THIS IS QUITE SUDDEN SAID THE SCARECROW BUT PLEASE GO AND BAR ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE PALACE WHILE I SHOW THIS PUMPKINHEAD HOW TO THROW A QUOIT
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
BUT IN A KINDLY SYMPATHETIC TONE DO NOT I BEG OF YOU DAMPEN TODAY'S SUN WITH THE SHOWERS OF TOMORROW FOR BEFORE YOUR HEAD HAS TIME TO SPOIL YOU CAN HAVE IT CANNED AND IN THAT WAY IT MAY BE PRESERVED INDEFINITELY
I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
RETURNED NICK WELL PLEASED MY HEART IS QUITE THE BEST PART OF ME BUT NOW LET US START UPON OUR JOURNEY THEY PERCHED THE ONE LEGGED PUMPKINHEAD UPON THE SAW HORSE AND TIED HIM TO HIS SEAT WITH CORDS
YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
AT THIS THEY ALL TURNED IN SURPRISE TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW'S HEAD WHICH LAY AT THE BACK OF THE NEST I AM COMPLETELY RUINED DECLARED THE SCARECROW AS HE NOTED THEIR ASTONISHMENT
I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
AND THE PAINTED SACK THAT SERVED HIM FOR A HEAD WAS CAREFULLY LAUNDERED AND RESTUFFED WITH THE BRAINS ORIGINALLY GIVEN HIM BY THE GREAT WIZARD HIS CLOTHES WERE ALSO CLEANED AND PRESSED BY THE IMPERIAL TAILORS AND HIS CROWN POLISHED AND AGAIN SEWED UPON HIS HEAD
I DID IT TO SAVE MY FRIENDS RETURNED THE HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT I PERISHED IN SO NOBLE AND UNSELFISH A MANNER BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DESPONDENT INQUIRED THE WOGGLE BUG THE SCARECROW'S CLOTHING IS STILL SAFE
THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
A NICKEL PLATED EMPEROR TIP AWOKE SOON AFTER DAWN BUT THE SCARECROW HAD ALREADY RISEN AND PLUCKED WITH HIS CLUMSY FINGERS A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF RIPE BERRIES FROM SOME BUSHES NEAR BY
AH THEN YOU WOULD NOT BE FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH RETURNED THE SCARECROW THE MATTER IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I SUSPECTED YOU SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD GLOOMILY
AND TIP'S SUGGESTION WAS WITH THE SCARECROW'S CONSENT QUICKLY ACTED UPON THEY SELECTED ALL THE NEWEST AND CLEANEST BILLS AND ASSORTED THEM INTO VARIOUS PILES THE SCARECROW'S LEFT LEG AND BOOT WERE STUFFED WITH FIVE DOLLAR BILLS
THE SOLDIER HASTENED TO DO THIS WHILE TIP WHO HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HEELS REMAINED IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW WITH WONDERING EYES HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED TO THROW THE QUOITS
IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE EVEN AS YOU NOW BEHOLD ME THE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS AND CRANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF ME AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS JUMPED UPON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD SEE MORE PLAINLY BEHOLD
BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR
LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THE BOY AND THE WOGGLE BUG ARE THE ONLY ONES IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW OBSERVING THE TRUTH OF THIS REMARK TIP SAID THEN I WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE FIRST WISH
IT FITS VERY NICELY DOES IT NOT AND THE WOGGLE BUG STOOD UP AND TURNED HIMSELF AROUND SLOWLY
AND HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN VERY KIND INDEED TO ME
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK
FOR SHE NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL WHY NOT START COUNTING AT A HALF OF ONE ASKED THE SAW HORSE ABRUPTLY THEN ANYONE CAN COUNT UP TO SEVENTEEN BY TWOS VERY EASILY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THE SAW HORSE WAS CONSIDERED
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
IF YOU'LL KEEP QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK I'LL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY FOR US ALL TO ESCAPE
AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
THEN IF ONE FALLS OFF WE WILL ALL FALL OFF AND WHILE THE SOLDIER WAS GONE FOR THE CLOTHESLINE HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED
THE TIN WOODMAN LOOKED AROUND HIM IN A PUZZLED WAY FOR THE SAW HORSE HAD UNTIL NOW REMAINED QUIETLY STANDING IN A CORNER WHERE THE EMPEROR HAD NOT NOTICED HIM TIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE ODD LOOKING CREATURE TO THEM
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
THE SAW HORSE ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF BUT I SEEM TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND OFTEN IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I KNOW MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE AROUND ME PERHAPS YOU DO SAID THE EMPEROR FOR EXPERIENCE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN WISDOM
TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
SO HE BEGGED HIS FRIENDS TO EXCUSE HIM WHILE HE RETIRED TO HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT AND ALLOWED HIS SERVANTS TO POLISH HIM THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND WHEN THE EMPEROR RETURNED HIS NICKEL PLATED BODY SHONE SO MAGNIFICENTLY
YOU MUST REMEMBER IT IS THE REGULAR ORDAINED EXISTENCE OF WOGGLE BUGS
AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
WHY THE THREE PILLS ARE IN THE BOX AGAIN SAID THE SCARECROW OF COURSE THEY ARE THE WOGGLE BUG DECLARED
IT IS NO MORE DANGEROUS TO FACE THOSE RECKLESS GIRLS THAN TO RIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED WOODEN HORSE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT OBSERVED HIS MAJESTY BUT FOR MY PART NOT BEING A SOLDIER I AM FOND OF DANGER
ENTREATED THE TIN WOODMAN TEARS OF SYMPATHY RUNNING DOWN HIS NICKEL CHEEKS I I DON'T KNOW
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
AND I SUPPOSE HE IS NOW MORE PROUD THAN EVER OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE IS INDEED SAID THE MAN WITH A POLITE BOW
THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
REPLIED THE SOLDIER STILL PALE WITH FEAR BUT WHERE WAS MY STANDING ARMY AT THE TIME INQUIRED HIS MAJESTY LOOKING AT THE SOLDIER GRAVELY YOUR STANDING ARMY WAS RUNNING ANSWERED THE FELLOW HONESTLY
BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
HOW ABOUT THESE WISHING PILLS ENQUIRED THE SCARECROW TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS JACKET POCKET CAN'T WE USE THEM TO ESCAPE NOT UNLESS WE CAN COUNT SEVENTEEN BY TWOS ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN
WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
AND AFTERWARD THE LITTLE PARTY RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
THE COWARDLY LION AND THE SCARECROW THE LINES OF THE ENGRAVING BEING TRACED UPON THE SILVER IN YELLOW GOLD ON THE WALLS HUNG SEVERAL PORTRAITS
THAT MAY BE BUT THE PILL GAVE ME A DREADFUL PAIN JUST THE SAME
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
WE OWE YOU MANY THANKS FOR THE GALLANT FIGHT YOU MADE I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ESCAPED VERY NICELY REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A TONE OF PRIDE NOT SO EXCLAIMED A HOLLOW VOICE
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
ARE YOUR SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED MY DEAR FRIEND I CANNOT SAY WAS THE REPLY FOR THE GIRLS OF OZ HAVE RISEN IN REVOLT AND DRIVEN ME OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY GREAT GOODNESS CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN WHAT A CALAMITY
COVERING TIP AND THE WOGGLE BUG AND JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD AND BEGAN TEARING IT AWAY AND FLYING OFF WITH IT ONLY TO LET IT DROP STRAW BY STRAW INTO THE GREAT GULF BENEATH THE SCARECROW'S HEAD NOTING WITH DISMAY THIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS INTERIOR
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
DON'T MENTION THAT TO THE TIN WOODMAN EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW EARNESTLY YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS TERRIBLY HE IS A PROUD MAN AS HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AND IT PLEASES HIM TO BE TERMED EMPEROR RATHER THAN KING
TO THAT OF HIS COMRADE DEAR ME SAID THE SCARECROW DOLEFULLY WHAT A MESS I'M IN NEVER MIND MY FRIEND RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN I'LL SEND YOU TO MY IMPERIAL LAUNDRY AND YOU'LL COME OUT AS GOOD AS NEW
ADDED THE SCARECROW YOUR MATHEMATICS SEEM TO ME VERY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MIXED PICKLES THE MORE YOU FISH FOR WHAT YOU WANT THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING IT I AM CERTAIN THAT IF THE THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL IT IS IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER
EXCLAIMED THE WOGGLE BUG ADMIRINGLY YES MY BRAINS ARE WORKING WELL TODAY ADMITTED THE SCARECROW AN ACCENT OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE THEN
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
AND IT WAS THE MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SCRATCHED DURING MY ADVENTUROUS EXPERIENCES YOU WILL OBSERVE THIS ENGRAVED STAR UPON MY LEFT BREAST IT NOT ONLY INDICATES WHERE MY EXCELLENT HEART LIES BUT
BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
AND GATHERING HER WORK TOGETHER SHE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN ELIZABETH CALLED OUT DEAR MADAM DO NOT GO I BEG YOU WILL NOT GO MISTER COLLINS MUST EXCUSE ME HE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME THAT ANYBODY NEED NOT HEAR I AM GOING AWAY MYSELF
THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MISTER BENNET ARE THEY NOT THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MUCH OFTENER THAN I CAN GET THEM BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT THEM TO DAY SAID ELIZABETH MY MOTHER'S PURPOSE WILL BE ANSWERED
ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES WHO SEEK TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE OTHER SEX BY UNDERVALUING THEIR OWN AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS
THAT I HAVE YOUR RESPECTED MOTHER'S PERMISSION FOR THIS ADDRESS YOU CAN HARDLY DOUBT THE PURPORT OF MY DISCOURSE HOWEVER YOUR NATURAL DELICACY MAY LEAD YOU TO DISSEMBLE MY ATTENTIONS HAVE BEEN TOO MARKED TO BE MISTAKEN
THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
NEGLECT I AM SURE YOU NEGLECT NOTHING THAT CAN ADD TO THE BEAUTIES OF THAT NOBLE PLACE CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY
ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
I RATHER WONDER NOW AT YOUR KNOWING ANY ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
AND I THOUGHT COLONEL FORSTER LOOKED VERY BECOMING THE OTHER NIGHT AT SIR WILLIAM'S IN HIS REGIMENTALS MAMMA CRIED LYDIA MY AUNT SAYS THAT COLONEL FORSTER AND CAPTAIN CARTER DO NOT GO SO OFTEN TO MISS WATSON'S AS THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME
WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
SINCE I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT ONE THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE FOUR PER CENTS WHICH WILL NOT BE YOURS TILL AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S DECEASE IS ALL THAT YOU MAY EVER BE ENTITLED TO
AND WHEN MISS BINGLEY LEFT THEM TOGETHER COULD ATTEMPT LITTLE BESIDES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH ELIZABETH SILENTLY ATTENDED HER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE SISTERS
AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
AND SHE WAS EAGERLY CALLING OUT WHILE HER DAUGHTER READ WELL JANE WHO IS IT FROM WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT DOES HE SAY WELL JANE MAKE HASTE AND TELL US MAKE HASTE MY LOVE IT IS FROM MISS BINGLEY SAID JANE AND THEN READ IT ALOUD
AND PAY ME THE COMPLIMENT OF BELIEVING WHAT I SAY I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY AND VERY RICH AND BY REFUSING YOUR HAND DO ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT YOUR BEING OTHERWISE IN MAKING ME THE OFFER YOU MUST HAVE SATISFIED THE DELICACY OF YOUR FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO MY FAMILY
SAID CATHERINE AND LYDIA ELIZABETH ACCEPTED THEIR COMPANY AND THE THREE YOUNG LADIES SET OFF TOGETHER IF WE MAKE HASTE SAID LYDIA AS THEY WALKED ALONG PERHAPS WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF CAPTAIN CARTER BEFORE HE GOES IN MERYTON THEY PARTED
WHOM THEY SECRETLY MEAN TO ACCEPT WHEN HE FIRST APPLIES FOR THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT SOMETIMES THE REFUSAL IS REPEATED A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD TIME I AM THEREFORE BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID
VERY UNWELL THIS MORNING WHICH I SUPPOSE IS TO BE IMPUTED TO MY GETTING WET THROUGH YESTERDAY MY KIND FRIENDS WILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING TILL I AM BETTER THEY INSIST ALSO ON MY SEEING MISTER JONES
I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
AND FINDING HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN VIEW OF THE HOUSE WITH WEARY ANKLES DIRTY STOCKINGS AND A FACE GLOWING WITH THE WARMTH OF EXERCISE SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE ALL BUT JANE WERE ASSEMBLED
SHE SEES THEM NOW VERY OFTEN STANDING IN CLARKE'S LIBRARY MISSUS BENNET WAS PREVENTED REPLYING BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE FOOTMAN WITH A NOTE FOR MISS BENNET IT CAME FROM NETHERFIELD AND THE SERVANT WAITED FOR AN ANSWER MISSUS BENNET'S EYES SPARKLED WITH PLEASURE
AND SHALL HOPE TO LEAD YOU TO THE ALTAR ERE LONG UPON MY WORD SIR CRIED ELIZABETH YOUR HOPE IS A RATHER EXTRAORDINARY ONE AFTER MY DECLARATION I DO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES IF SUCH YOUNG LADIES THERE ARE
IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
WERE YOUR FRIEND LADY CATHERINE TO KNOW ME I AM PERSUADED SHE WOULD FIND ME IN EVERY RESPECT ILL QUALIFIED FOR THE SITUATION WERE IT CERTAIN THAT LADY CATHERINE WOULD THINK SO SAID MISTER COLLINS VERY GRAVELY
AND THAT THEY MUST ENDEAVOUR TO GET THE BETTER OF IT ADVISED HER TO RETURN TO BED AND PROMISED HER SOME DRAUGHTS THE ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED READILY FOR THE FEVERISH SYMPTOMS INCREASED AND HER HEAD ACHED ACUTELY
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
THAT I DO NOT RECKON THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF LADY CATHERINE DE BOURGH AS AMONG THE LEAST OF THE ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER TO OFFER YOU WILL FIND HER MANNERS BEYOND ANYTHING I CAN DESCRIBE AND YOUR WIT AND VIVACITY I THINK MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO HER
THEY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT OFFICERS AND MISTER BINGLEY'S LARGE FORTUNE THE MENTION OF WHICH GAVE ANIMATION TO THEIR MOTHER WAS WORTHLESS IN THEIR EYES WHEN OPPOSED TO THE REGIMENTALS OF AN ENSIGN AFTER LISTENING ONE MORNING TO THEIR EFFUSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT
BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
AND THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE A FEW BOOKS WERE LYING HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
WHO WERE USUALLY TEMPTED THITHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THEIR AUNT AND TO A MILLINER'S SHOP JUST OVER THE WAY THE TWO YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY CATHERINE AND LYDIA WERE PARTICULARLY FREQUENT IN THESE ATTENTIONS THEIR MINDS WERE MORE VACANT THAN THEIR SISTERS
BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
VERY NONSENSICAL TO COME AT ALL WHY MUST SHE BE SCAMPERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HER SISTER HAD A COLD HER HAIR SO UNTIDY SO BLOWSY YES AND HER PETTICOAT I HOPE YOU SAW HER PETTICOAT SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM
AND JANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN WITHHELD BY THE FEAR OF GIVING ALARM OR INCONVENIENCE FROM EXPRESSING IN HER NOTE HOW MUCH SHE LONGED FOR SUCH A VISIT WAS DELIGHTED AT HER ENTRANCE SHE WAS NOT EQUAL HOWEVER TO MUCH CONVERSATION
WHO ARE SO DARING AS TO RISK THEIR HAPPINESS ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ASKED A SECOND TIME I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS IN MY REFUSAL YOU COULD NOT MAKE ME HAPPY AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I AM THE LAST WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE YOU SO NAY
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN
ELIZABETH WOULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH AN INJUNCTION AND A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION MAKING HER ALSO SENSIBLE THAT IT WOULD BE WISEST TO GET IT OVER AS SOON AND AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND TRIED TO CONCEAL
BUT ABLE TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO A GOOD WAY THIS IS MY ADVICE FIND SUCH A WOMAN AS SOON AS YOU CAN BRING HER TO HUNSFORD AND I WILL VISIT HER ALLOW ME BY THE WAY TO OBSERVE MY FAIR COUSIN
WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT
HER INQUIRIES AFTER HER SISTER WERE NOT VERY FAVOURABLY ANSWERED MISS BENNET HAD SLEPT ILL AND THOUGH UP WAS VERY FEVERISH AND NOT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ROOM ELIZABETH WAS GLAD TO BE TAKEN TO HER IMMEDIATELY
OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE EVERY DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OFFICERS NAMES AND CONNECTIONS THEIR LODGINGS WERE NOT LONG A SECRET AND AT LENGTH THEY BEGAN TO KNOW THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MISTER PHILLIPS VISITED THEM ALL
WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MANY AMIABLE YOUNG WOMEN BUT THE FACT IS THAT BEING AS I AM TO INHERIT THIS ESTATE AFTER THE DEATH OF YOUR HONOURED FATHER WHO HOWEVER MAY LIVE MANY YEARS LONGER
COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ON RECEIPT OF THIS MY BROTHER AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE TO DINE WITH THE OFFICERS YOURS EVER CAROLINE BINGLEY WITH THE OFFICERS CRIED LYDIA I WONDER MY AUNT DID NOT TELL US OF THAT
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
ALMOST AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE I SINGLED YOU OUT AS THE COMPANION OF MY FUTURE LIFE
THEREFORE DO NOT BE ALARMED IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF HIS HAVING BEEN TO ME AND EXCEPTING A SORE THROAT AND HEADACHE THERE IS NOT MUCH THE MATTER WITH ME YOURS ET CETERA WELL MY DEAR SAID MISTER BENNET WHEN ELIZABETH HAD READ THE NOTE ALOUD
IS THIS A HINT TO ME LIZZY SAID HER FATHER TO SEND FOR THE HORSES NO INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO AVOID THE WALK THE DISTANCE IS NOTHING WHEN ONE HAS A MOTIVE ONLY THREE MILES I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER
SHE WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF AS LONG AS SHE STAYS THERE IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WOULD GO AND SEE HER IF I COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO HER THOUGH THE CARRIAGE WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND AS SHE WAS NO HORSEWOMAN
THOUGH AMPLE FOR HER SITUATION IN LIFE COULD BUT ILL SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF HIS HER FATHER HAD BEEN AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON AND HAD LEFT HER FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS SHE HAD A SISTER MARRIED TO A MISTER PHILLIPS
NO NO NONSENSE LIZZY I DESIRE YOU TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND UPON ELIZABETH'S SEEMING REALLY WITH VEXED AND EMBARRASSED LOOKS ABOUT TO ESCAPE SHE ADDED LIZZY I INSIST UPON YOUR STAYING AND HEARING MISTER COLLINS
ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE I SHALL BE UNIFORMLY SILENT AND YOU MAY ASSURE YOURSELF THAT NO UNGENEROUS REPROACH SHALL EVER PASS MY LIPS WHEN WE ARE MARRIED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INTERRUPT HIM NOW
AND WHERE HER APPEARANCE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE WALKED THREE MILES SO EARLY IN THE DAY IN SUCH DIRTY WEATHER AND BY HERSELF WAS ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY
DO NOT CONSIDER ME NOW AS AN ELEGANT FEMALE INTENDING TO PLAGUE YOU BUT AS A RATIONAL CREATURE SPEAKING THE TRUTH FROM HER HEART YOU ARE UNIFORMLY CHARMING CRIED HE WITH AN AIR OF AWKWARD GALLANTRY
IF WHAT I HAVE HITHERTO SAID CAN APPEAR TO YOU IN THE FORM OF ENCOURAGEMENT I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY REFUSAL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ITS BEING ONE YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO FLATTER MYSELF MY DEAR COUSIN THAT YOUR REFUSAL OF MY ADDRESSES IS MERELY WORDS OF COURSE
BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY
ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
AND MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF LONGBOURN ESTATE WHENEVER IT FALLS WITHOUT ANY SELF REPROACH THIS MATTER MAY BE CONSIDERED THEREFORE AS FINALLY SETTLED AND RISING AS SHE THUS SPOKE SHE WOULD HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD MISTER COLLINS NOT THUS ADDRESSED HER
IF YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD HAVE A DANGEROUS FIT OF ILLNESS IF SHE SHOULD DIE IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL IN PURSUIT OF MISTER BINGLEY AND UNDER YOUR ORDERS OH I AM NOT AFRAID OF HER DYING PEOPLE DO NOT DIE OF LITTLE TRIFLING COLDS
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT WHEN SANCTIONED BY THE EXPRESS AUTHORITY OF BOTH YOUR EXCELLENT PARENTS MY PROPOSALS WILL NOT FAIL OF BEING ACCEPTABLE TO SUCH PERSEVERANCE IN WILFUL SELF DECEPTION ELIZABETH WOULD MAKE NO REPLY
SHE DID AT LAST EXTORT FROM HER FATHER AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE HORSES WERE ENGAGED JANE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GO ON HORSEBACK AND HER MOTHER ATTENDED HER TO THE DOOR WITH MANY CHEERFUL PROGNOSTICS OF A BAD DAY HER HOPES WERE ANSWERED
BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY IF THEY HAD UNCLES ENOUGH TO FILL ALL CHEAPSIDE CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE
AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN WHEN I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING HER AGAIN I SHALL SPEAK IN THE VERY HIGHEST TERMS OF YOUR MODESTY ECONOMY AND OTHER AMIABLE QUALIFICATION INDEED MISTER COLLINS ALL PRAISE OF ME WILL BE UNNECESSARY YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF
AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF
A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE THAN TO DECLINE THEM I AM NOT NOW TO LEARN REPLIED MISTER COLLINS WITH A FORMAL WAVE OF THE HAND THAT IT IS USUAL WITH YOUNG LADIES TO REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF THE MAN
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
MY CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF DE BOURGH AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR OWN ARE CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY IN MY FAVOUR AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT INTO FURTHER CONSIDERATION THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR MANIFOLD ATTRACTIONS
BUT LYDIA WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO EXPRESS HER ADMIRATION OF CAPTAIN CARTER AND HER HOPE OF SEEING HIM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AS HE WAS GOING THE NEXT MORNING TO LONDON I AM ASTONISHED MY DEAR SAID MISSUS BENNET
AND ELIZABETH WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY HELD HER IN CONTEMPT FOR IT SHE WAS RECEIVED HOWEVER VERY POLITELY BY THEM AND IN THEIR BROTHER'S MANNERS THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER THAN POLITENESS THERE WAS GOOD HUMOUR AND KINDNESS MISTER DARCY SAID VERY LITTLE
ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
ESPECIALLY WHEN TEMPERED WITH THE SILENCE AND RESPECT WHICH HER RANK WILL INEVITABLY EXCITE THUS MUCH FOR MY GENERAL INTENTION IN FAVOUR OF MATRIMONY IT REMAINS TO BE TOLD WHY MY VIEWS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO LIKE THEM HERSELF WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH AFFECTION AND SOLICITUDE THEY SHOWED FOR JANE THE APOTHECARY CAME AND HAVING EXAMINED HIS PATIENT SAID AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT A VIOLENT COLD
I AM NOT A GREAT READER AND I HAVE PLEASURE IN MANY THINGS IN NURSING YOUR SISTER I AM SURE YOU HAVE PLEASURE SAID BINGLEY AND I HOPE IT WILL BE SOON INCREASED BY SEEING HER QUITE WELL ELIZABETH THANKED HIM FROM HER HEART
WHEN I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF SPEAKING TO YOU NEXT ON THE SUBJECT I SHALL HOPE TO RECEIVE A MORE FAVOURABLE ANSWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THOUGH I AM FAR FROM ACCUSING YOU OF CRUELTY AT PRESENT
YES BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY ARE ALL OF THEM VERY CLEVER THIS IS THE ONLY POINT I FLATTER MYSELF ON WHICH WE DO NOT AGREE I HAD HOPED THAT OUR SENTIMENTS COINCIDED IN EVERY PARTICULAR BUT I MUST SO FAR DIFFER FROM YOU
I ADMIRE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE OBSERVED MARY BUT EVERY IMPULSE OF FEELING SHOULD BE GUIDED BY REASON AND IN MY OPINION EXERTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO WHAT IS REQUIRED WE WILL GO AS FAR AS MERYTON WITH YOU
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
BY INCESSANT EMPLOYMENT THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN DISTRESS AND DIVERSION MISSUS BENNET AND KITTY WALKED OFF AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE MISTER COLLINS BEGAN BELIEVE ME MY DEAR MISS ELIZABETH
SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE
SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEIR UNCLE IS AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON YES
YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
AND ONE OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS TOGETHER SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE ADDRESSED THE MOTHER IN THESE WORDS MAY I HOPE MADAM FOR YOUR INTEREST WITH YOUR FAIR DAUGHTER ELIZABETH WHEN I SOLICIT FOR THE HONOUR OF A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
YOU ARE TOO HASTY SIR SHE CRIED YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE MADE NO ANSWER LET ME DO IT WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT YOU ARE PAYING ME I AM VERY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR OF YOUR PROPOSALS
THIS HAS BEEN MY MOTIVE MY FAIR COUSIN AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL NOT SINK ME IN YOUR ESTEEM AND NOW NOTHING REMAINS FOR ME BUT TO ASSURE YOU IN THE MOST ANIMATED LANGUAGE OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY AFFECTION TO FORTUNE I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
I WOULD RATHER BE PAID THE COMPLIMENT OF BEING BELIEVED SINCERE I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THE HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN YOUR PROPOSALS BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE MY FEELINGS IN EVERY RESPECT FORBID IT CAN I SPEAK PLAINER
ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
DINING OUT SAID MISSUS BENNET THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY CAN I HAVE THE CARRIAGE SAID JANE NO MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER GO ON HORSEBACK BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKELY TO RAIN AND THEN YOU MUST STAY ALL NIGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCHEME SAID ELIZABETH
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS ABOVE HER ANKLES IN DIRT AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE
THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO READY TO THINK YOUR OWN CHILDREN SILLY IF I WISHED TO THINK SLIGHTINGLY OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN IT SHOULD NOT BE OF MY OWN HOWEVER IF MY CHILDREN ARE SILLY I MUST HOPE TO BE ALWAYS SENSIBLE OF IT
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I LIKED A RED COAT MYSELF VERY WELL AND INDEED SO I DO STILL AT MY HEART AND IF A SMART YOUNG COLONEL WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR SHOULD WANT ONE OF MY GIRLS I SHALL NOT SAY NAY TO HIM
GEORGE CURTIS TOLD US HIS STORY WHICH IN ITS WAY WAS ALMOST AS EVENTFUL AS OUR OWN AND PUT SHORTLY AMOUNTED TO THIS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAD STARTED FROM SITANDA'S KRAAL
WHAT DOES IT ALL COME TO FOR FORTY YEARS AND MORE I LIVED AMONG SAVAGES AND STUDIED THEM AND THEIR WAYS AND NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE IN ENGLAND AND HAVE IN MY OWN STUPID MANNER
AND KICKED LIKE THE VERY DEUCE WELL UP AND DOWN I WALKED STARING AT THE GUNS AND THE HORNS WHICH THE GUNS HAD BROUGHT LOW AND AS I DID SO THERE ROSE UP IN ME A GREAT CRAVING
SO THAT WE MAY NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE PRIDE OF KNOWLEDGE MAN'S CLEVERNESS IS ALMOST INDEFINITE AND STRETCHES LIKE AN ELASTIC BAND
HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT ON THE TOP OF A BANK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM IN SO DOING HE LOOSENED A GREAT BOULDER OF ROCK WHICH FELL UPON GEORGE CURTIS'S RIGHT LEG CRUSHING IT FRIGHTFULLY
AND BEGAN HOBBLING TOWARDS US WHEN HE WAS CLOSE HE FELL DOWN IN A SORT OF FAINT WITH A SPRING SIR HENRY WAS BY HIS SIDE GREAT POWERS HE CRIED
SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF OUR RE ARRIVAL AT SITANDA'S WHERE WE FOUND OUR GUNS AND OTHER GOODS QUITE SAFE THOUGH THE OLD RASCAL IN CHARGE WAS MUCH DISGUSTED AT OUR SURVIVING TO CLAIM THEM
BUT WE DID ACCOMPLISH IT SOMEHOW AND TO GIVE ITS DETAILS WOULD ONLY BE TO REPRODUCE MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED TO US ON THE FORMER OCCASION
I WOULD THAT IT HAD BEEN MY SOUL AND NOT MY BOY'S WE BURIED HIM THIS AFTERNOON UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREY AND ANCIENT TOWER OF THE CHURCH OF THIS VILLAGE WHERE MY HOUSE IS
LOOK HERE YOU FELLOWS I SAID IS THAT A WHITE MAN OR AM I MAD SIR HENRY LOOKED AND GOOD LOOKED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LAME WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD UTTERED A GREAT CRY
AND THE CHILD OF CIVILIZATION ARE IDENTICAL I DARE SAY THAT THE HIGHLY CIVILIZED LADY READING THIS WILL SMILE AT AN OLD FOOL OF A HUNTER'S SIMPLICITY WHEN SHE THINKS OF HER BLACK BEAD BEDECKED SISTER
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
FIXED AS THE STARS MORE ENDURING THAN THE MOUNTAINS AS UNALTERABLE AS THE WAY OF THE ETERNAL HUMAN NATURE IS GOD'S KALEIDOSCOPE AND THE LITTLE BITS OF COLOURED GLASS
THEY LOOKED VERY WHITE UPON THE BLACK CLOTH THERE WAS A LITTLE HITCH ABOUT GETTING THE COFFIN DOWN INTO THE GRAVE THE NECESSARY ROPES HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN SO WE DREW BACK FROM IT
AND IN ITS SEASON REDUCES US TO POWDER POOR HARRY TO GO SO SOON JUST WHEN HIS LIFE WAS OPENING TO HIM HE WAS DOING SO WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
IT WAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN NOW MY DEAR OLD FELLOW BURST OUT SIR HENRY AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD I HAVE BEEN OVER SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS TO FIND YOU
ITS STIFF FORMAL MANNERS AND ITS WELL DRESSED CROWDS HE BEGINS TO LONG AH HOW HE LONGS FOR THE KEEN BREATH OF THE DESERT AIR
YOUR FONDNESS FOR PIGMENTS AND POWDERS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LOVE TO SUBJUGATE YOURSELF TO THE RICH WARRIOR WHO HAS CAPTURED YOU IN MARRIAGE AND THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH YOUR TASTE IN FEATHERED HEAD DRESSES VARIES
FINALLY WE PREVAILED UPON HIM TO CONSENT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT GEORGE CURTIS DID NOT KNOW OF IT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
YOU WILL REACH HERE BY CHRISTMAS AND I BOOK YOU TO STAY WITH ME FOR THAT GOOD IS COMING AND GEORGE AND SO BY THE WAY IS YOUR BOY HARRY THERE'S A BRIBE FOR YOU
I HAVE JUST BURIED MY BOY MY POOR HANDSOME BOY OF WHOM I WAS SO PROUD AND MY HEART IS BROKEN
TO THE CERTAINTY OF PERISHING IN THE DESERT AS FOR FOOD HOWEVER THEY GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION AND THE OASIS WAS FREQUENTED ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT BY LARGE QUANTITIES OF GAME
YOU CAN FINISH WRITING THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES ON BOARD SHIP WE HAVE REFUSED TO TELL THE TALE TILL IT IS WRITTEN BY YOU FOR FEAR LEST WE SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED IF YOU START ON RECEIPT OF THIS
AS SUCH STONES HAVE NEVER TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET IN ANYTHING LIKE SUCH QUANTITIES IT APPEARS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OR TWO OF THE LARGEST THEY ARE OF THE FINEST WATER
BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL A ROBIN REDBREAST CAME AS BOLD AS COULD BE AND LIT UPON THE COFFIN AND BEGAN TO SING AND THEN I AM AFRAID THAT I BROKE DOWN
IN A PROMISCUOUS WAY AND FIND ME WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD OF AND THE MOST MERCIFUL TOO THEN SIR HENRY SET TO WORK AND TOLD HIM THE MAIN FACTS OF OUR ADVENTURES
OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW LOST COUNT FELL ALSO DO NOT LET ME HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECRYING OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING AS THEY DO THE GATHERED EXPERIENCE OF HUMANITY
FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
WHEREBY YOU WILL MAKE IT BULGE OUT THE OTHER BUT YOU WILL NEVER WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES AND MAN IS MAN INCREASE ITS TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS THE ONE FIXED UNCHANGEABLE THING
WE DO NOT PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE IT LIKE THE POOR INDIANS WE FLY HITHER AND THITHER WE CRY FOR MERCY BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE BLACK FATE THUNDERS ON
AND WAITED IN SILENCE WATCHING THE BIG FLAKES FALL GENTLY ONE BY ONE LIKE HEAVENLY BENEDICTIONS AND MELT IN TEARS ON HARRY'S PALL
IT IS MY BROTHER GEORGE AT THE SOUND OF THIS DISTURBANCE ANOTHER FIGURE ALSO CLAD IN SKINS EMERGED FROM THE HUT A GUN IN HIS HAND AND RAN TOWARDS US
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL COME IF IT IS ONLY TO OBLIGE
THAT IT IS THE FITTEST BEGINNING TO THE HISTORY THAT I AM ABOUT TO WRITE IF IT PLEASE GOD TO SPARE ME TO FINISH IT IF NOT WELL IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT EXTRACT WAS PENNED SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR SO
SUCH AS USED TO BE OWNED BY THE DUTCHMEN A ROER THEY CALL IT THAT GUN THE BOER I BOUGHT IT FROM MANY YEARS AGO TOLD ME HAD BEEN USED BY HIS FATHER AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLOOD RIVER
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
I LONGED ONCE MORE TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE ARMS OF NATURE NOT THE NATURE WHICH YOU KNOW THE NATURE THAT WAVES IN WELL KEPT WOODS AND SMILES OUT IN CORN FIELDS BUT NATURE
THAT HE MAY ENJOY REST BUT THE REST HAS COME TO HIM BEFORE THE LABOUR OH MY BOY MY BOY I AM LIKE THE MAN IN THE BIBLE WHO LAID UP MUCH GOODS
AND LIKE A NORTHERN LIGHT COMES BUT TO FADE AND LEAVE THE SKY MORE DARK OUT OF THE SOIL OF BARBARISM IT HAS GROWN LIKE A TREE AND AS I BELIEVE
UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUND AND NOW I COME TO PERHAPS THE STRANGEST ADVENTURE THAT HAPPENED TO US IN ALL THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
AND SO GEORGE CURTIS ENDED WE HAVE LIVED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS LIKE A SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SOME NATIVES MIGHT COME HERE TO HELP US AWAY BUT NONE HAVE COME
NOR WILL THERE BE ONE MORE BIT OF COLOURED GLASS NOR ONE LESS FOR EVER AND EVER THIS BEING SO SUPPOSING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT WE DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO TWENTY PARTS
BUT FINALLY THEY REACHED THIS OASIS WHERE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFELL GEORGE CURTIS ON THE DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE WAS SITTING BY THE STREAM AND JIM WAS EXTRACTING THE HONEY FROM THE NEST OF A STINGLESS BEE
A BOULDER FELL ON MY LEG AND CRUSHED IT AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACK THEN I CAME UP HOW DO YOU DO MISTER NEVILLE I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER ME
HIS TIME IS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN SHAVING AND OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE VAIN ADORNING OF THE BODY
YOU CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IT YOU CAN POLISH IT HIGHLY
INTO THE SOIL LIKE A TREE IT WILL ONCE MORE SOONER OR LATER FALL AGAIN AS THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION FELL AS THE HELLENIC CIVILIZATION FELL AND AS THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION AND MANY OTHERS
LET SOME MAN COME AND STRIKE YOU IN THE FACE WHILST YOU ARE ENJOYING THAT MARVELLOUS LOOKING DISH AND WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAVAGE THERE IS IN YOU
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
AND LIKE HIM HE IS A COOL YOUNG HAND HE SHOT ME IN THE LEG CUT OUT THE PELLETS AND THEN REMARKED UPON THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A MEDICAL STUDENT WITH EVERY SHOOTING PARTY GOOD BYE OLD BOY I CAN'T SAY ANY MORE
THEY HAVE A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WEAR THAT VERY LOW DRESS TO THE SAVAGE WOMAN'S BEADS YOUR HABIT OF TURNING ROUND AND ROUND TO THE SOUND OF HORNS AND TOM TOMS
IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE OTHER NINETEEN MAKING THEM APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AS THE BLACKING DOES A BOOT OR THE VENEER A TABLE IT IS ON THE NINETEEN ROUGH
AND RECOMMENDED US TO SELL BY DEGREES
AS FOR THE NOTE I HAD SENT HIM BY JIM THAT WORTHY LOST IT AND HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL TO DAY BUT ACTING UPON INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE NATIVES HE HEADED NOT FOR SHEBA'S BREASTS
WHO GAVE US BIRTH AND WILL IN A DAY TO COME GIVE US OUR BURIAL ALSO AND SO IN MY TROUBLE AS I WALKED UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE OF MY HOUSE THERE IN YORKSHIRE
FROM THAT DAY HE HAD BEEN SO LAME THAT HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO EITHER FORWARD OR BACK
SERVICEABLE SAVAGE PORTIONS THAT WE FALL BACK ON EMERGENCIES NOT ON THE POLISHED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL TWENTIETH CIVILIZATION SHOULD WIPE AWAY OUR TEARS
HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
WHICH CAME THITHER FOR WATER THESE THEY SHOT OR TRAPPED IN PITFALLS USING THE FLESH FOR FOOD AND AFTER THEIR CLOTHES WORE OUT THE HIDES FOR CLOTHING
BUT IF YOU WHOSE EYES MAY PERCHANCE ONE DAY FALL UPON MY WRITTEN THOUGHTS HAVE GOT SO FAR AS THIS I ASK YOU TO PERSEVERE SINCE WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS NOT WITHOUT ITS INTEREST
LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
IF IT IS ONLY TO SEE YOU HARRY MY BOY AND TO LOOK AFTER THE PRINTING OF THIS HISTORY WHICH IS A TASK THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO TRUST TO ANYBODY ELSE
AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
ALL OF WHICH I HAD SHOT MYSELF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS AS I NEVER KEEP ANY HORNS WHICH ARE NOT IN EVERY WAY PERFECT UNLESS IT MAY BE NOW AND AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM
ALLAN QUATERMAIN BY H RIDER HAGGARD I INSCRIBE THIS BOOK OF ADVENTURE TO MY SON ARTHUR JOHN RIDER HAGGARD IN THE HOPE THAT IN DAYS TO COME HE
CIVILIZATION FAILS US UTTERLY BACK BACK WE CREEP AND LAY US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE GREAT BREAST OF NATURE SHE THAT PERCHANCE MAY SOOTHE US AND MAKE US FORGET
I WOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS PLACE WHERE I LIVED IDLY AND AT EASE BACK AGAIN TO THE WILD LAND WHERE I HAD SPENT MY LIFE WHERE I MET MY DEAR WIFE AND POOR HARRY WAS BORN
I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN AND NOW I COME ACROSS YOU PERCHED IN THE DESERT LIKE AN OLD ASSVOEGEL
AS SURELY AND AS CERTAINLY AS IT TURNS THE STARS AND CONTINUALLY FALL INTO NEW PATTERNS AND COMBINATIONS BUT THE COMPOSING ELEMENTS REMAIN THE SAME
MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
AND WATCH THE LINES OF GAME TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIDGES TO THE WATER THE RULING PASSION IS STRONG IN DEATH THEY SAY AND MY HEART WAS DEAD THAT NIGHT BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF MY TROUBLE
BEAUTIFULLY SHAVED FROCK COAT FITTING LIKE A GLOVE BRAND NEW EYE GLASS ET CETERA ET CETERA I WENT AND WALKED IN THE PARK WITH HIM WHERE I MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW AND AT ONCE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS
EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
NO HUNTER EVER CAME TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS CERTAINLY NO HUNTER WOULD EVER SETTLE IN IT I STARED AND STARED AND SO DID THE OTHER MAN AND JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE SIR HENRY AND GOOD WALKED UP
WHEN SUDDENLY I STOPPED AND RUBBED MY EYES AS WELL I MIGHT THERE NOT TWENTY YARDS IN FRONT OF ME PLACED IN A CHARMING SITUATION UNDER THE SHADE OF A SPECIES OF FIG TREE
AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
IS TO A LARGE EXTENT FREE FROM THE GREED OF MONEY WHICH EATS LIKE A CANCER INTO THE HEART OF THE WHITE MAN IT IS A DEPRESSING CONCLUSION BUT IN ALL ESSENTIALS THE SAVAGE
AND SO DID SIR HENRY CURTIS STRONG MAN THOUGH HE IS AND AS FOR CAPTAIN GOOD I SAW HIM TURN AWAY TOO EVEN IN MY OWN DISTRESS I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IT
JUST AFTER DINGAAN SWEPT INTO NATAL AND SLAUGHTERED SIX HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO THAT THE BOERS NAMED THE PLACE WHERE THEY DIED WEENEN OR THE PLACE OF WEEPING
SIR HENRY LAUGHED THEY BELONG TO QUATERMAIN AND GOOD IT WAS A PART OF THE BARGAIN THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE ANY SPOILS THERE MIGHT BE THIS REMARK SET ME THINKING
NO MAN WHO HAS FOR FORTY YEARS LIVED THE LIFE I HAVE CAN WITH IMPUNITY GO COOP HIMSELF IN THIS PRIM ENGLISH COUNTRY WITH ITS TRIM HEDGEROWS AND CULTIVATED FIELDS
AND SO IT IS CALLED TO THIS DAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE CALLED AND MANY AN ELEPHANT HAVE I SHOT WITH THAT OLD GUN
WHICH REPRESENT OUR PASSIONS HOPES FEARS JOYS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS GOOD AND EVIL AND WHAT NOT ARE TURNED IN HIS MIGHTY HAND
HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY AS SOME ILL NATURED PERSON HAS PRINTED IT IN A SOCIETY PAPER TO COME TO BUSINESS GOOD AND I TOOK THE DIAMONDS TO STREETER'S TO BE VALUED AS WE ARRANGED
THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
DONE MY BEST TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND A GREAT GULF FIXED NO ONLY A VERY LITTLE ONE THAT A PLAIN MAN'S THOUGHT MAY SPRING ACROSS
AND NOW YOU OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU WHO AS I FANCIED HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME AND WERE LIVING COMFORTABLY IN OLD ENGLAND TURN UP
IT WAS A DREARY DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND THE SKY WAS HEAVY WITH SNOW BUT NOT MUCH WAS FALLING THE COFFIN WAS PUT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND A FEW BIG FLAKES LIT UPON IT
AND FACING TO THE STREAM WAS A COSY HUT BUILT MORE OR LESS ON THE KAFIR PRINCIPLE WITH GRASS AND WITHES BUT HAVING A FULL LENGTH DOOR INSTEAD OF A BEE HOLE
AND ONE WHICH SHOWS HOW WONDERFULLY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT I WAS WALKING ALONG QUIETLY SOME WAY IN FRONT OF THE OTHER TWO DOWN THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS FROM THE OASIS TILL IT IS SWALLOWED UP IN THE HUNGRY DESERT SANDS
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
A KAFIR CAME UP MY AVENUE OF ORANGE TREES CARRYING A LETTER IN A CLEFT STICK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST IT TURNED OUT TO BE FROM SIR HENRY AND AS IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GIVE IT IN FULL
AND THE FELLOW FELL AT MY FEET AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER WEEPING FOR JOY YOU CARELESS SCOUNDREL I SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE WELL SJAMBOCKED THAT IS HIDED MEANWHILE
BESIDES THE QUESTION WILL ARISE HOW MANY OF THESE BLESSINGS ARE DUE TO CHRISTIANITY AS DISTINCT FROM CIVILIZATION AND SO THE BALANCE SWAYS AND THE STORY RUNS
UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT I AM NOT FAR OFF HARRY WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I USED TO LIVE IN A VERY FINE HOUSE AT LEAST I CALL IT A FINE HOUSE SPEAKING COMPARATIVELY
THE ABOVE SIGNED ALLAN QUATERMAIN IS AN EXTRACT FROM MY DIARY WRITTEN TWO YEARS AND MORE AGO I COPY IT DOWN HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
HERE A GAIN THERE A LOSS AND NATURE'S GREAT AVERAGE STRUCK ACROSS THE TWO WHEREOF THE SUM TOTAL FORMS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT MIGHTY EQUATION
IT IS VERY HARD HAVING ONLY ONE SON TO LOSE HIM THUS BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD COMPLAIN THE GREAT WHEEL OF FATE
NINETEEN SAVAGE AND ONE CIVILIZED WE MUST LOOK TO THE NINETEEN SAVAGE PORTIONS OF OUR NATURE IF WE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND NOT TO THE TWENTIETH
I TRIED TO CROSS SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE ANSWER SPOKEN IN THE HESITATING VOICE OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD LITTLE RECENT OPPORTUNITY OF USING HIS TONGUE BUT WHEN I REACHED HERE
BUT I COULD NOT EAT MUCH AND SOON I TOOK TO WALKING OR RATHER LIMPING BEING PERMANENTLY LAME FROM THE BITE OF A LION UP AND DOWN
BUT FOR THE LADDER LIKE DESCENT OF THE MOUNTAINS DOWN WHICH WE HAD JUST COME WHICH IS CLEARLY A BETTER ROUTE THAN THAT MARKED OUT IN OLD DOM SILVESTRA'S PLAN IN THE DESERT HE AND JIM HAD SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIPS
AND BUILDED BARNS GOODS FOR MY BOY AND BARNS FOR HIM TO STORE THEM IN AND NOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN REQUIRED OF HIM AND I AM LEFT DESOLATE
AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
FETCHED UP ALL RIGHT IN ENGLAND WE GOT OFF THE BOAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND WENT UP TO TOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A SWELL
SITTING TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO DO IT BY JOVE SAID GEORGE CURTIS WHEN I SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE DIAMONDS WELL AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR PAINS BESIDES MY WORTHLESS SELF
WHEN THE FIRST JOY AT THEIR MEETING WAS OVER THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM SHE HAD HEARD OF HIS FATHER HAVING FORGIVEN HIM AND OF HIS WISH TO HAVE HIM HOME AGAIN SO BEFORE HIS WEDDING WITH THE PRINCESS HE WENT TO VISIT HIS FATHER
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN ABLE AND FORBEARING MAN BUT HE OUTRAGED THE NOBLES
HAD RECOGNIZED HER SON AND THE NEW MONARCH WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION HE RESPECTFULLY CONDUCTED THE CZARINA TO A CARRIAGE WALKING BARE HEADED BY ITS SIDE IN THE CAPITAL HE TREATED HER WITH EVERY ATTENTION
IVAN THE TERRIBLE OF RUSSIA HAVING MURDERED HIS ELDEST SON LEFT THE CROWN TO THE NEXT FEODORE A PRINCE SO FEEBLE IN BODY AND MIND THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY HAD TO BE COMMITTED TO THE CARE
WHEN HE CAME BACK THE FATHER AGAIN ASKED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE BIRDS SAY THEN THE FATHER FELL INTO A RAGE AND SAID OH YOU LOST MAN
THE WATER OF LIFE LONG BEFORE YOU OR I WERE BORN THERE REIGNED IN A COUNTRY A GREAT WAY OFF A KING WHO HAD THREE SONS THIS KING
SHUISKI THEN PRETENDED TO HAVE DISCOVERED THE BODY OF YOUNG DEMETRIUS IN THE RUINS OF UGLITCH AND HIS CLERICAL FRIENDS CONTRIVED A MIRACLE FOR THE OCCASION WHEN THE BODY WAS BROUGHT TO MOSCOW
THE SLOVENLY WAY IN WHICH THE INQUIRY HAD BEEN MADE THE FACT THAT IT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED BY CREATURES OF BORIS THAT THE BODY WAS NEVER EXAMINED NOR THE KNIFE COMPARED WITH THE WOUND TOGETHER WITH THE ATTEMPTED OBLITERATION OF ALL SURROUNDING DWELLINGS
AND REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE MASTER AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER ASKED NOW MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE DOGS SAY WHEN THEY BARK
THE REGENT LEFT THIS BOY TO THE CARE OF HIS MOTHER THE DOWAGER CZARINA UNDER WHOSE CHARGE HE ATTAINED TO THE AGE OF TEN ONE AFTERNOON OF MAY FIFTEEN NINETY ONE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING WITH FOUR OTHER BOYS
AND FOUND THAT THE PATH WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM SO THAT HE WAS SHUT IN ALL ROUND HE NEXT TRIED TO GET OFF HIS HORSE AND MAKE HIS WAY ON FOOT BUT AGAIN THE LAUGH RANG IN HIS EARS
THE EMPEROR LOUIS ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL RIGHT SAVE THAT OF MIGHT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE DULY RECOGNIZED PRINCE TO SUCCEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ELECTORATE AND INVESTED HIS OWN SON LOUIS WITH IT
THE PRINCE THANKED HIS LITTLE FRIEND WITH THE SCARLET CLOAK FOR HIS FRIENDLY AID
IT IS THE WATER OF LIFE IF HE COULD HAVE A DRAUGHT OF IT HE WOULD BE WELL AGAIN BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THEN THE ELDEST SON SAID I WILL SOON FIND IT AND HE WENT TO THE SICK KING
FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SHOT YOU THEN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S COAT AND GAVE HIM THE SHABBY ONE AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD SOME TIME AFTER THREE GRAND EMBASSIES CAME TO THE OLD KING'S COURT
AFFORD VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THAT A MURDER HAD BEEN DONE AND BY THE INSTIGATION OF THE REGENT BUT THAT DEMETRIUS DIED THERE CAN SCARCELY BE THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT AFTER SEVEN YEARS FEODORE DIED
SAID THE PRINCE SCORNFULLY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF PUT THE SAME SPELL UPON HIM AS HE PUT ON HIS ELDER BROTHER AND HE TOO WAS AT LAST OBLIGED
INDEED AND THEIR DELIGHT AT BEING DELIVERED FROM THE DOMINION OF THE BAVARIANS WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR COUNTRY AFTER IT HAD BEEN FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS GOVERNED BY THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE THAT THEY FURNISHED THE SUPPOSED VOLDEMAR
THEY TOOK HIM FORTH BUT WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM THEY COULD NOT DO IT FOR PITY AND LET HIM GO
IN THE CHAPEL DU SAINT ESPRIT WHICH WAS THE GENERAL PLACE OF SEPULTURE
SO HE CALLED HIS COURT TOGETHER AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND ALL AGREED THAT HE OUGHT TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE PRINCE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON TILL ONE DAY WHEN THE KING'S CHIEF HUNTSMEN WENT A HUNTING WITH HIM
WHICH HE ALSO TOOK FURTHER ON
WHEN THE SECOND PRINCE HAD THUS BEEN GONE A LONG TIME THE YOUNGEST SON SAID HE WOULD GO AND SEARCH FOR THE WATER OF LIFE AND TRUSTED HE SHOULD SOON BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS FATHER WELL AGAIN
HAVING DECLARED FOR HIS RIVAL FOR THE EMPIRE FREDERICK OF AUSTRIA IN THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHAT HOWEVER CHIEFLY CONFIRMS THEIR VIEW OF THE CASE IN THE EYES OF THE CLAIMANT'S ADVOCATES IS
AND WHEN THE LIONS WERE QUIETED HE WENT ON THROUGH THE CASTLE AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A BEAUTIFUL HALL AROUND IT HE SAW SEVERAL KNIGHTS SITTING IN A TRANCE THEN HE PULLED OFF THEIR RINGS
THAT ENDURED FOR SOME YEARS NOW COMMENCED BETWEEN THE RIVAL ELECTORS BUT FINALLY VOLDEMAR INFLICTED SUCH A SIGNAL DEFEAT UPON HIS OPPONENT'S FORCES THAT LOUIS RELINQUISHED THE CONTEST IN DISGUST
AND A VALUABLE JEWELLED CROSS THIS WAS IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN O THREE WHEN DEMETRIUS IF LIVING WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWENTY TWO AN AGE APPARENTLY CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF THE CLAIMANT TO HIS NAME
AND PUT THEM ON HIS OWN FINGERS IN ANOTHER ROOM
BUT HE BEGGED SO HARD THAT THE KING LET HIM GO AND THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IF I BRING MY FATHER THIS WATER HE WILL MAKE ME SOLE HEIR TO HIS KINGDOM THEN HE SET OUT
ONCE FELL VERY ILL SO ILL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT HE COULD LIVE HIS SONS WERE VERY MUCH GRIEVED AT THEIR FATHER'S SICKNESS AND AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER VERY MOURNFULLY IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE
SO THAT IT WAS FEARED ALL MUST DIE FOR WANT BUT THE PRINCE GAVE THE KING OF THE LAND THE BREAD AND ALL HIS KINGDOM ATE OF IT AND HE LENT THE KING THE WONDERFUL SWORD AND HE SLEW THE ENEMY'S ARMY WITH IT
TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
SAID HE BUT THE PRINCE BEGGED VERY HARD AND SAID ONLY TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE ANGRY FOR I WILL FORGIVE YOU ALAS SAID THE HUNTSMAN THE KING HAS ORDERED ME TO SHOOT YOU
BUT PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE THE ROYAL PILGRIM OBLIGED HIS SUBJECTS TO SWEAR THAT IN THE EVENT OF HIM AND HIS BROTHER DYING CHILDLESS THEY WOULD RECEIVE FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN
THE POPULACE AT ONCE DECLARED FOR HIM AND COMPELLED THE ELECTOR LOUIS TO RETIRE CHARLES THE FOURTH WHO HAD SUCCEEDED LOUIS THE FOURTH AS EMPEROR AND WAS ON BAD TERMS WITH THE ELECTOR LOUIS THE LATE MONARCH'S SON
A DISCONTENTED NOBLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PARDONED FOR CONSPIRACY BROKE INTO THE PALACE HUNTED THEIR PREY FROM ROOM TO ROOM UNTIL ALREADY BLEEDING FROM A SABRE WOUND THE UNFORTUNATE VICTIM LEAPED OUT OF A WINDOW
DEMETRIUS NOW SET TO WORK TO GOVERN WITH HUMANITY AND JUSTICE BOTH QUALITIES QUITE UNSUITED TO RUSSIAN TASTES WHO SOON GREW AS TIRED OF THEIR NEW CZAR AS THEY HAD BEEN OF HIS PREDECESSORS
THE STATEMENT AS TO HIS DECEASE IN THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS THEY POINT OUT CONTRADICTORY WHILST HAD THE ELECTOR LOUIS KNOWN OF HIS PREDECESSOR'S DEATH WHY DID HE NOT PROCURE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE SAME
TO PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY ON HIS BEHALF THE RECEIVED OPINION IS THAT RUDOLPH
HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
NEVERTHELESS THE UNKNOWN PRODUCED A RUSSIAN SEAL BEARING THE NAME AND ARMS
SO THAT HE DID NOT WAKE UP TILL THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING A QUARTER TO TWELVE THEN HE SPRANG FROM THE COUCH DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED RAN TO THE WELL FILLED A CUP THAT WAS STANDING BY HIM FULL OF WATER AND HASTENED TO GET AWAY IN TIME
VISITORS ARRIVED WHO QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THEIR RESUSCITATED PRINCE WARTS WHICH THE LATE EMPEROR'S SON HAD HAD ON THE FOREHEAD AND UNDER THE RIGHT EYE WERE DISCOVERED WHILST ONE ARM BEING LONGER THAN ANOTHER
THEY RECEIVED HIM BACK WITH TRANSPORTS OF JOY SUCH WAS THEIR ENTHUSIASM
WHICH WAS A BRANCH OF THE ASCAGNE FAMILY THIS WAS A D THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER VOLDEMAR'S DEPARTURE HIS BROTHER JOHN DIED SUDDENLY NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED
SO HE SET OUT AND THE DWARF MET HIM TOO AT THE SAME SPOT IN THE VALLEY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST AND THE PRINCE SAID
THE VARIOUS MARKS BY WHICH HE MIGHT DECEIVE THE WORLD THUS RUNS THE STORY AS TOLD BY THE ADVOCATES FOR THE IMPOSTURE THEORY PRESENTLY IT WILL BE SEEN WHAT CAN BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILST NOW
LORD HAVE MERCY ON US CRIED THE FATHER IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE LEARNT I WILL SEND YOU INTO ANOTHER TOWN TO ANOTHER MASTER THE YOUTH WAS TAKEN THITHER AND STAYED A YEAR WITH THIS MASTER LIKEWISE
AND WANTED TO PUNISH HIS WICKED SONS BUT THEY MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND GOT INTO A SHIP AND SAILED AWAY OVER THE WIDE SEA AND WHERE THEY WENT TO NOBODY KNEW AND NOBODY CARED
SAID THE PRINCE HAUGHTILY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF WAS ENRAGED AT HIS BEHAVIOUR AND LAID A FAIRY SPELL OF ILL LUCK UPON HIM SO THAT AS HE RODE ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BECAME NARROWER
BOUNTIFULLY WITH GOODS AND MONEY AND RENDERED HIM EVERY ASSISTANCE TOWARDS DRIVING OUT LOUIS ALMOST ALL THE TOWNS AND CITIES ACKNOWLEDGED HIS AUTHORITY AND PROMISED OBEDIENCE TO HIS RULE
AND RETIRED TO HIS DOMAINS IN THE TYROL MAKING OVER HIS CLAIM UPON BRANDENBURG TO HIS TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS THIS TRANSFERENCE OF THE ELECTORATE IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THE EMPEROR CHARLES AFTERWARDS
IN ORDER TO AFFORD A FAIR IDEA OF THIS PRETENDER'S CLAIMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RECOUNT THE STORY OF HIS APPEARANCE AS DETAILED BY THE AUTHORS FAVOURING THE THEORY OF HIS BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND THEN
OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW BORIS THIS BOLD AND UNSCRUPULOUS MAN ASPIRED TO THE THRONE BUT BETWEEN HIM AND THE IMBECILE WHO OCCUPIED IT STOOD DEMETRIUS ANOTHER CHILD OF THE LATE MONARCH
THIS HE OWES TO THY HOLY PRAYERS THE AUDIENCE WAS CONVINCED SOBBED IN UNISON AND FROM ALL SIDES AROSE THE CRY HE IS THE SON OF THE TERRIBLE
THE ABSENT ELECTOR APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE SAD EVENT DID NOT RETURN AND IT WAS QUICKLY NOISED ABROAD HAD ALSO MET WITH A SUDDEN DEATH
THE MAN HE ASSERTED HIMSELF TO BE NOT ONLY AUTHORS INK BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HUMAN BLOOD WAS WASTED IN THE DISPUTE AND THAT TOO
AND TAUNTED HIM AS TO HIS BIRTH THE WRETCHED MAN COLLECTING HIS STRENGTH EXCLAIMED I AM YOUR CZAR THE SON OF IVAN VASSILIEVITCH WHEN HIS AGONY WAS TERMINATED BY A SHOT FROM AN ARQUEBUSS
AND NOW THE OLD KING GATHERED TOGETHER HIS COURT AND ASKED ALL HIS KINGDOM TO COME AND CELEBRATE THE WEDDING OF HIS SON AND THE PRINCESS AND YOUNG AND OLD NOBLE AND SQUIRE
THEY RECOGNIZED THE CORPSE AS THAT OF THE REAL PRINCE AND AFFIRMED THAT BY HEAVENLY PROVIDENCE IT HAD BEEN PRESERVED IN ITS THEN CONDITION IT BEING FOUND QUITE UNCORRUPT AND THE GLOW OF LIFE NOT EVEN FADED FROM THE CHEEK
NOT ONLY DID VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT AND THAT APPARENTLY CONTRARY TO THEIR INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WANDERER BUT THEY EVEN
AND NARROWER AND AT LAST THE WAY WAS SO STRAITENED THAT HE COULD NOT GO TO STEP FORWARD AND WHEN HE THOUGHT TO HAVE TURNED HIS HORSE ROUND AND GO BACK THE WAY HE CAME HE HEARD A LOUD LAUGH RINGING ROUND HIM
AND THUS THE KINGDOM WAS ONCE MORE IN PEACE AND PLENTY IN THE SAME MANNER HE BEFRIENDED TWO OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SEA THEY GOT INTO A SHIP
THE GUARDS SAID HE WAS NOT THE TRUE PRINCE AND THAT HE TOO MUST GO AWAY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND AWAY HE WENT NOW WHEN THE FULL YEAR WAS COME ROUND THE THIRD BROTHER
AFTER THEY HAD BEEN LEFT TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY CAME OUT AND THREW THEMSELVES INTO ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS IN THE FULL VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS MULTITUDE WHICH HAD ASSEMBLED
AND I AM GLAD THAT I HAD PITY ON HIM BUT LET HIM GO IN PEACE AND BROUGHT HOME HIS ROYAL COAT AT THIS THE KING WAS OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AND MADE IT KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM
TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE AS IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE HIM NO SAID THE KING I HAD RATHER DIE THAN PLACE YOU IN SUCH GREAT DANGER AS YOU MUST MEET WITH IN YOUR JOURNEY
AND THEN TO MARRY HIM AND TO GIVE HIM THE KINGDOM THEN THEY ALL THREE RODE ON TOGETHER AND ON THEIR WAY HOME CAME TO A COUNTRY THAT WAS LAID WASTE BY WAR AND A DREADFUL FAMINE
THAT HE WOULD REST HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AND GAZE ON THE LOVELY SCENES AROUND HIM
THE PRINCE BEGGED SO HARD FOR HIS BROTHERS THAT THE DWARF AT LAST SET THEM FREE THOUGH UNWILLINGLY SAYING BEWARE OF THEM FOR THEY HAVE BAD HEARTS THEIR BROTHER HOWEVER
THE HISTORY OF THIS ADVENTURER IS RENDERED MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON HIS BEHALF AND VEHEMENTLY ASSERT THAT HE WAS TRULY
HIS CONSORT MARINA DIED IN PRISON AND IVAN ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN
AND BLAMED THE YOUNGEST FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO POISON THEIR FATHER BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND HAD BROUGHT IT WITH THEM HE NO SOONER BEGAN TO DRINK OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT HIM THAN HE FELT HIS SICKNESS LEAVE HIM
MOREOVER ONE HISTORIAN SHOWS FROM CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
THEY WILL LET YOU PASS THEN HASTEN ON TO THE WELL AND TAKE SOME OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE FOR IF YOU TARRY LONGER THE DOOR WILL SHUT UPON YOU FOR EVER THEN
ON THE TWENTIETH OF JUNE SIXTEEN O FIVE THE ADVENTURER ENTERED MOSCOW IN STATE AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF BELIEVING MULTITUDES ON ENTERING THE CHURCH OF SAINT MICHAEL THE PSEUDO DEMETRIUS ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS
HE DID IT THOROUGHLY AND BROUGHT A CHEST FULL OF GOLD OUT WITH HIM THE HOWLING OF THE WILD DOGS WAS HENCEFORTH HEARD NO MORE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE COUNTRY WAS FREED FROM THE TROUBLE AFTER SOME TIME
WITHOUT THE WORLD BEING ANY THE WISER THE FACTS AS THEY ARE RECOUNTED BY HISTORIANS STAND THUS VOLDEMAR THE SECOND MARQUIS OF BRANDENBURG WAS THE THIRTEENTH
FATHER I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER IS SURELY DEAD AND THE KINGDOM WILL FALL TO ME IF I FIND THE WATER THE KING WAS AT FIRST VERY UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
AND WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER INQUIRED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED DEAR FATHER I HAVE THIS YEAR LEARNT WHAT THE FROGS CROAK
THAT THEY MIGHT CARRY THEM TO THE OLD MAN AS A TOKEN THE YOUTH WANDERED ON AND AFTER SOME TIME CAME TO A FORTRESS WHERE HE BEGGED FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING YES SAID THE LORD OF THE CASTLE IF YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT
DECLARED FOR THE CLAIMANT AS DID ALSO THE RULERS OF BRUNSWICK POMERANIA MECKLENBURG AND SEVERAL OTHERS INCLUDING VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT
THE YOUNGEST SON BROUGHT HIS CUP TO THE SICK KING THAT HE MIGHT DRINK AND BE HEALED SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD HE TASTED THE BITTER SEA WATER WHEN HE BECAME WORSE EVEN THAN HE WAS BEFORE AND THEN BOTH THE ELDER SONS CAME IN
WHAT ROUTE HE INTENDED TAKING OR INDEED FURNISHING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND RELATIVE TO HIS INTENTIONS VOLDEMAR AND HIS BROTHER JOHN WERE THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE ELDER BRANCH OF THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE
WHO HAD DISAPPEARED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PREVIOUSLY ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE CHIEF PLACES OF THE HOLY LAND WHICH HE HAD IT WAS GIVEN FORTH VISITED BUT HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER AND BEEN KEPT IN CAPTIVITY BY THE INFIDELS UNTIL RECENTLY
NAMED JACQUES REBOC HE WAS THEY MOREOVER ALLEGE AN HABITUAL LIAR AND A CUNNING VAGABOND POSSESSING SOME RESEMBLANCE IN FORM AND FACE TO THE LOST PRINCE SUCH RESEMBLANCE INDEED
IN LITHUANIA IN WHOSE EMPLOY HE WAS WAS THAT THE PHYSICIAN IN ATTENDANCE UPON HIM DEMETRIUS HAVING BEEN SOLICITED BY BORIS TO DESTROY HIM CONSENTED BUT INSTEAD OF DOING SO SUBSTITUTED THE BODY OF A SERF'S CHILD
THE KING OF DENMARK WHO SINGULARLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO NAMED VOLDEMAR AND BY SOME OTHER POTENTATES EQUALLY DESIROUS OF HAVING A HAND IN THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S AFFAIRS HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF ABLE TO PLACE A GOOD ARMY IN THE FIELD
AND IN A SHORT TIME ALMOST THE WHOLE EMPIRE DECLARED FOR HIM HIS REIGN HOWEVER WAS SHORT DESERTED BY HIS FOREIGN ALLIES HE WAS FORCED TO FLY AND EVENTUALLY WAS ASSASSINATED
LEFT THE FOREST IN WHICH HE HAD LAIN HID FOR FEAR OF HIS FATHER'S ANGER AND SET OUT IN SEARCH OF HIS BETROTHED BRIDE SO HE JOURNEYED ON THINKING OF HER ALL THE WAY AND RODE SO QUICKLY THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SEE WHAT THE ROAD WAS MADE OF
BUT A STILL MORE FORMIDABLE TEST WAS TO BE UNDERGONE THE DOWAGER CZARINA FORSOOK THE CONVENT
TO BEHOLD THE MAN CLAIMING TO BE HER SON DEMETRIUS WENT TO MEET HER IN REGAL STATE AND THEIR FIRST INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN A MAGNIFICENT TENT SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR THE INTERESTING CEREMONY
DWELT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN SAXONY WHERE HE HAD BEEN WELL INSTRUCTED AS TO THE FORMER LIFE AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS OF THE DECEASED ELECTOR AS WELL AS PUT IN THE WAY OF COUNTERFEITING ON HIS PERSON
AFTER LYING EXPOSED FOR SOME DAYS WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY BURIED WITHOUT THE WALLS THEN DISINTERRED AND BURNT THE ASHES COLLECTED AND TO MAKE SURE OF NO FURTHER RESUSCITATION
IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
OR DISPERSED FOR THEIR HASTY JUDGMENT UPON THE SUPPOSED ASSASSINS THE PALACE WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND THE FLOURISHING TOWN TURNED INTO A DESERT AND THE DOWAGER CZARINA FORCED INTO A CONVENT
A LITTLE OLD MAN MET THEM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS VERY ILL AND THAT THEY WERE AFRAID NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM I KNOW WHAT WOULD SAID THE LITTLE OLD MAN
SLAY WHOLE ARMIES AND THE BREAD WILL NEVER FAIL YOU THEN THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I CANNOT GO HOME TO MY FATHER WITHOUT MY BROTHERS SO HE SAID MY DEAR FRIEND CANNOT YOU TELL ME WHERE MY TWO BROTHERS ARE
OF SAXONY AND BRANDENBURG VESTED IN ONE PERSON PRODUCED A CERTAIN MAN WHOM HE DOUBTLESS MEANT TO USE AS A TOOL THIS MAN HE DECLARED TO BE HIS DEAR COUSIN VOLDEMAR
HE TOOK IT IN HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD TRAVEL TO ROME ON THE WAY HE PASSED BY A MARSH IN WHICH A NUMBER OF FROGS WERE SITTING CROAKING HE LISTENED TO THEM AND WHEN HE BECAME AWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING HE GREW VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SAD
TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAINS THUS IT IS WITH PROUD SILLY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEMSELVES ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE AND ARE TOO PROUD TO ASK OR TAKE ADVICE
HIS FOLLOWERS WERE DESTROYED HIS WIFE BARELY ESCAPED WITH LIFE AND EVERY KIND OF INDIGNITY WAS OFFERED TO THE POLISH LADIES IN ATTENDANCE UPON HER THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN
BUT THIS MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITION DID NOT SATISFY EVERYBODY AND WHILST THE PARTIZANS OF THE LATE CZAR WERE AFFIRMING THAT A BODY HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OCCASION THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ROUSED TO A STATE OF FRENZY
A FEASIBLE STORY WAS INVENTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ESCAPE OF THE INTENDED VICTIM OF THE LATE MASSACRE AND TO CONFIRM THE NATION IN THE BELIEF OF HIS IDENTITY WITH THEIR LATE CZAR MARINA THE WIDOWED CZARINA
THEY ARE BEWITCHED AND ARE OBLIGED TO WATCH OVER A GREAT TREASURE WHICH IS BELOW IN THE TOWER AND THEY CAN HAVE NO REST UNTIL IT IS TAKEN AWAY AND I HAVE LIKEWISE LEARNT FROM THEIR DISCOURSE
GENTLE AND SIMPLE CAME AT ONCE ON THE SUMMONS AND AMONG THE REST CAME THE FRIENDLY DWARF WITH THE SUGARLOAF HAT AND A NEW SCARLET CLOAK AND THE WEDDING WAS HELD AND THE MERRY BELLS RUN
IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE CLAIMANT THE RUMOUR OF VOLDEMAR'S RETURN FROM A LONG AND PAINFUL CAPTIVITY IN TURKEY
IN DAILY HOPE OF HIS SON'S RETURN
ELECTOR OF THE FAMILY OF THE COUNTS OF ASCAGNE A FAMILY CLOSELY RELATED
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES I WILL SEND YOU TO A THIRD MASTER BUT IF YOU LEARN NOTHING THIS TIME ALSO I WILL NO LONGER BE YOUR FATHER THE YOUTH REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE THIRD MASTER ALSO
PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AS HER OWN DEMETRIUS LIVED WITH HIM AS HIS CONSORT AND HAD A CHILD BY HIM HER FATHER THE PALATINE OF SANDOMIR ALSO RECOGNIZED HIM AS HIS SON IN LAW
I CAN GET NOTHING INTO YOUR HEAD YOU MUST GO FROM HENCE I WILL GIVE YOU INTO THE CARE OF A CELEBRATED MASTER WHO SHALL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH YOU THE YOUTH WAS SENT INTO A STRANGE TOWN
THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
HEADACHES AND STAGGERING FITS OF DIZZINESS MADE ME REEL LIKE A DRUNK MY COMPANIONS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS SOME CREWMEN WERE AT THEIR LAST GASP
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
IF ONLY MY NAUTILUS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED WELL I ASKED NOT CATCHING THE CAPTAIN'S MEANING DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON THAT THE CONGEALING OF THIS WATER
THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE
AND GRATITUDE TO MY TWO COMPANIONS NED AND CONSEIL HAD KEPT ME ALIVE DURING THE FINAL HOURS OF OUR LONG DEATH THROES BUT NO EXPRESSION OF THANKS COULD REPAY THEM FULLY FOR SUCH DEVOTION
BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD
YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE
I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
I KNOW IT SIR SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN
IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
CHAPTER SIXTEEN SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC
AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
HE CAN USE ME ANY WAY HE WANTS HE WON'T TURN DOWN YOUR ASSISTANCE COME ALONG NED I LED THE CANADIAN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE PUTTING ON THEIR DIVING SUITS I INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF NED'S PROPOSITION
THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN METER BARRIER THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT
THE WORK KEPT ME GOING BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING
INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF
WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
THE BOAT SANK AND WAS FITTED INTO ITS SOCKET JUST THEN THE WHOLE CREW RETURNED ON BOARD AND THE DOUBLE OUTSIDE DOOR WAS CLOSED BY THIS POINT THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING ON A BED OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
IS TO WORK FASTER THAN THE WATER SOLIDIFIES WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE FIRST THAT'S ALL GET THERE FIRST BY THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS TYPE OF TALK FOR SEVERAL HOURS THAT DAY I WIELDED MY PICK DOGGEDLY
PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS LIFE SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS WE COULD BREATHE WE COULD BREATHE
WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SIXTH I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
CONSEIL KEPT STILL I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS HE PONDERED THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH GENTLEMEN
THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING IT HAD TO BE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
WHAT FINE OXYGEN LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED
UPSIDE DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE
WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
BUT THIS HARDLY MATTERED SO LONG AS THE LOWER SURFACE KEPT GROWING THINNER AFTER TWO HOURS OF ENERGETIC WORK NED LAND REENTERED EXHAUSTED HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REPLACED BY NEW WORKMEN INCLUDING CONSEIL AND ME
WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
SEPARATING US FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS A MERE TRACT OF ICE COULD WE BREAK THROUGH IT
BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION
I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE
OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
AND A WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND SILVER TEA SETS AND COOKIES COOKIES OH MOST DECIDEDLY COOKIES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BREAD AND PORRIDGE
AND ALONE I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT MY WORK IS WORK WORK SURE THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH WORK TO DO IF YOU HAD FIVE KIDS AND NO HIRED GIRL
LET'S HAVE MY WHOLE DUTY AS A WIFE HE WAS GRUMBLING THE WHOLE THING'S RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE CRITICISM YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MAKING MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D OPPOSE ANY DECENT CONSTRUCTIVE WORK FOR THE TOWN OR FOR YOU'RE RIGHT ALL I'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN LINE
NO IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A GREATNESS OF LIFE A REFUSAL TO BE CONTENT WITH EVEN THE HEALTHIEST MUD DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY EVER SOLVED A PROBLEM BY RUNNING AWAY FROM IT PERHAPS
AND ANNOUNCED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD ADDRESS A FARMERS POLITICAL MEETING THAT NIGHT THE NEWS RAN A MOB OF A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LED BY THE SHERIFF THE TAME VILLAGE STREET AND THE SMUG VILLAGE FACES RUDDLED BY THE LIGHT OF BOBBING LANTERNS
AND BECAUSE IN THE STRESS OF WAR WORK WITH ITS DEMAND FOR THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY CLERKS SHE COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE WORLD OF OFFICES HUGH WAS TO GO WITH HER DESPITE THE WAILS AND RATHER EXTENSIVE COMMENTS OF AUNT BESSIE
HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
DISLOYAL NON PATRIOTIC PRO GERMAN PACIFISTS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DID THIS ORGANIZER SAY ANYTHING PRO GERMAN NOT ON YOUR LIFE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE HIS LAUGH WAS STAGEY
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
FOR A MONTH THEY DISCUSSED IT THEY HURT EACH OTHER VERY MUCH AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE CLOSE TO WEEPING AND INVARIABLY HE USED BANAL PHRASES ABOUT HER DUTIES AND SHE USED PHRASES QUITE AS BANAL ABOUT FREEDOM AND THROUGH IT ALL
THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE SO DISCONTENTED I KNOW THAT'S WHAT MOST MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD EXPLAIN ALL I AM AND ALL I WANT AND I SHOULDN'T ARGUE WITH THEM
SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
SHE WADED DOWN STILLY CLOISTERS BETWEEN BURNT STUMP AND ICY OAK THROUGH DRIFTS MARKED WITH A MILLION HIEROGLYPHICS OF RABBIT AND MOUSE AND BIRD SHE SQUEALED AS HE LEAPED ON A PILE OF BRUSH AND FIRED AT THE RABBIT WHICH RAN OUT HE BELONGED THERE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME GO WITH YOU TO PARIS AND STUDY ART MAYBE AND WEAR VELVETEEN PANTS AND A WOMAN'S BONNET AND LIVE ON SPAGHETTI NO I THINK WE CAN SAVE YOU THAT TROUBLE YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND I AM GOING I REALLY AM
WHICH MADE THE REARING OF CITIZENS MORE COSTLY AND PERILOUS THAN ANY OTHER CRIME IT WAS INADVISABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN TILL HE HAD MADE MORE MONEY SHE WAS SORRY PERHAPS HE HAD MADE ALL THE MYSTERY OF LOVE A MECHANICAL CAUTIOUSNESS BUT
DECLARED SAM AND KENNICOTT AND DAVE DYER JOINED IN A PROUD YOU BET CAROL WALKED OUT HASTILY KENNICOTT OBSERVING HER THROUGH SUPPER TIME SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS BUBBLING AND WOULD SOON BOIL OVER
WASN'T SAM RATHER NEEDLESSLY HEROIC ALL THESE ORGANIZERS YES
HER COLLAR WHITE WITH FROST FROM HER BREATH SHE BOUGHT A CAN OF TOMATOES AS THOUGH IT WERE ORIENT FRUIT AND RETURNED HOME PLANNING TO SURPRISE KENNICOTT WITH AN OMELET CREOLE FOR DINNER SO BRILLIANT WAS THE SNOW GLARE
REALIZE HOW VALUABLE SHE WILL BE TO ANY WAR BOARD WITH WHICH SHE CHOOSES TO BECOME CONNECTED GOPHER PRAIRIE THUS ADDS ANOTHER SHINING STAR TO ITS SERVICE FLAG AND WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOCK ANY NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES
SO HAVE I TO MINE WELL I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY LIFE AND YOU'RE IT YOU'RE MY LIFE YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF SO I'M DAMNED IF I'LL AGREE TO ALL YOUR FREAK NOTIONS BUT I WILL SAY I'VE GOT TO DEPEND ON YOU
THERE'VE BEEN A GOOD MANY TIMES WHEN WE HADN'T A MAID AND I DID ALL THE HOUSEWORK AND CARED FOR HUGH AND WENT TO RED CROSS AND DID IT ALL VERY EFFICIENTLY I'M A GOOD COOK AND A GOOD SWEEPER
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
SHE SWORE IT WITH SOFT FIST BEATING THE EDGES OF THE RADIATOR AND AT THE END OF ALL HER VOWS SHE HAD NO NOTION AS TO WHEN AND WHERE THE CRUSADE WAS TO BEGIN BECOME AN AUTHENTIC PART OF THE TOWN
THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE
IT WAS SO RICH LOOKING TO SIT AND DRIVE AND SO EASY SKIING AND SLIDING WERE STUPID AND OLD FASHIONED IN FACT THE VILLAGE LONGED FOR THE ELEGANCE OF CITY RECREATIONS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE CITIES LONGED FOR VILLAGE SPORTS
CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
HER LIVELIEST ACTIVITY NOW WAS ORGANIZING OUTDOOR SPORTS IN THE MOTOR PARALYZED TOWN THE AUTOMOBILE AND BRIDGE WHIST HAD NOT ONLY MADE MORE EVIDENT THE SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT THEY HAD ALSO ENFEEBLED THE LOVE OF ACTIVITY
AND IF I HAD MY WAY I'D MAKE YOU FOLKS LIVE UP TO THE ESTABLISHED RULES OF DECENCY EVEN IF I HAD TO TAKE YOU WILL SHE WAS NOT TIMOROUS NOW AM I PRO GERMAN IF I FAIL TO THROB TO HONEST JIM BLAUSSER TOO
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM WITH ME SUPPOSE I REFUSE YOU WON'T FORLORNLY UH CARRIE WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT YOU WANT ANYWAY OH CONVERSATION
WITH SAM CLARK KENNICOTT AND CAROL PRESENT THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THOSE FELLOWS
THE MOB FLOWING BETWEEN THE SQUATTY ROWS OF SHOPS HAD TAKEN THE ORGANIZER FROM HIS HOTEL RIDDEN HIM ON A FENCE RAIL PUT HIM ON A FREIGHT TRAIN AND WARNED HIM NOT TO RETURN THE STORY WAS THRESHED OUT IN DAVE DYER'S DRUG STORE
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THE FARMERS HE IS ORGANIZING WILL DEPRIVE YOU TOWNSMEN OF THE MONEY YOU MAKE OUT OF MORTGAGES AND WHEAT AND SHOPS OF COURSE SINCE WE'RE AT WAR WITH GERMANY ANYTHING THAT ANY ONE OF US DOESN'T LIKE IS PRO GERMAN
HE CALLED BOTH LYMAN CASS THE MILLER AND THE FINN HOMESTEADER FROM LOST LAKE BY THEIR FIRST NAMES HE WAS KNOWN AS THE RED SWEDE AND CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY INSANE BJORNSTAM COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIS HANDS SOLDER A PAN
THEY UPSET AND GOT SNOW DOWN THEIR NECKS THEY SHRIEKED THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AND THEY DID NOT DO IT AGAIN AT ALL SHE BADGERED ANOTHER GROUP INTO GOING SKIING THEY SHOUTED AND THREW SNOWBALLS
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
WELD AN AUTOMOBILE SPRING SOOTHE A FRIGHTENED FILLY TINKER A CLOCK CARVE A GLOUCESTER SCHOONER WHICH MAGICALLY WENT INTO A BOTTLE NOW FOR A WEEK HE WAS COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF GOPHER PRAIRIE
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN WOULD ALWAYS STAY HOME IF THEY HAD THE MONEY HUGH COMPLAINED NOTICE ME MUMMY HE WAS BESIDE HER ON THE RED PLUSH SEAT OF THE DAY COACH A BOY OF THREE AND A HALF
AND GOPHER PRAIRIE TOOK AS MUCH PRIDE IN NEGLECTING COASTING AS SAINT PAUL OR NEW YORK IN GOING COASTING CAROL DID INSPIRE A SUCCESSFUL SKATING PARTY IN MID NOVEMBER
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
HE WENT OFF ON COUNTRY CALLS IN A SHINY FLORAL STEEL TIPPED CUTTER ONLY HIS RUDDY NOSE AND HIS CIGAR EMERGING FROM THE FUR CAROL HERSELF STIRRED MAIN STREET BY A LOOSE COAT OF NUTRIA HER FINGER TIPS LOVED THE SILKEN FUR
BUT WHEN SNOW HAD ENDED THE SKATING AND SHE TRIED TO GET UP A MOONLIGHT SLIDING PARTY THE MATRONS HESITATED TO STIR AWAY FROM THEIR RADIATORS AND THEIR DAILY BRIDGE WHIST IMITATIONS OF THE CITY SHE HAD TO NAG THEM THEY SCOOTED DOWN A LONG HILL ON A BOB SLED
THAT THEY REDISCOVERED WITH SURPRISE AND A FEELING OF HEROISM THIS ARMOR OF AN ARTIC EXPLORER WINTER GARMENTS SURPASSED EVEN PERSONAL GOSSIP AS THE TOPIC AT PARTIES IT WAS GOOD FORM TO ASK PUT ON YOUR HEAVIES YET
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX KENNICOTT WAS NOT SO INHUMANLY PATIENT THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO FORGIVE CAROL'S HERESIES TO WOO HER AS HE HAD ON THE VENTURE TO CALIFORNIA SHE TRIED TO BE INCONSPICUOUS
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE
WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS COMPETITION OR BAD MUSIC IF WE WERE FIGHTING ENGLAND YOU'D CALL THE RADICALS PRO ENGLISH WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE CALLING THEM RED ANARCHISTS WHAT AN ETERNAL ART IT IS SUCH A GLITTERY DELIGHTFUL ART
MISSUS KENNICOTT CONFIDED TO YE SCRIBE THAT SHE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MULTIFARIOUS WAR ACTIVITIES NOW CENTERING IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE RETURNING HER COUNTLESS FRIENDS WHO APPRECIATE HER SPLENDID LABORS WITH THE LOCAL RED CROSS
WERE SEEN PERILOUSLY STAGGERING UP LADDERS CARRYING STORM WINDOWS AND SCREWING THEM TO SECOND STORY JAMBS WHILE KENNICOTT PUT UP HIS WINDOWS CAROL DANCED INSIDE THE BEDROOMS AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO SWALLOW THE SCREWS
THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR
THE FRAMES OF THEIR BUCK SAWS WERE CHERRY RED THE BLADES BLUED STEEL AND THE FRESH CUT ENDS OF THE STICKS POPLAR MAPLE IRON WOOD BIRCH WERE MARKED WITH ENGRAVED RINGS OF GROWTH
WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER EXCELLENT FOR INSTEAD OF SLIPPING DOWNWARD SHE BEGAN TO CLIMB SHE SIGHED I COULDN'T DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR WILL'S KINDNESS HIS GIVING ME MONEY BUT A SECOND AFTER
AND EVEN IF I AM COWARDLY AND RUN AWAY ALL RIGHT CALL IT COWARDLY CALL ME ANYTHING YOU WANT TO I'VE BEEN RULED TOO LONG BY FEAR OF BEING CALLED THINGS I'M GOING AWAY TO BE QUIET AND THINK I'M I'M GOING I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OWN LIFE
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
WHAT EDITORIAL DID HE GET THAT FROM SHE WONDERED AS SHE PROTESTED SEE HERE MY BELOVED WHY CAN'T YOU TORIES DECLARE WAR HONESTLY YOU DON'T OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZER BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S SEDITIOUS
SHE ROSE TO A RADIANCE OF SUN ON SNOW SNUG IN HER FURS SHE TROTTED UP TOWN FROSTED SHINGLES SMOKED AGAINST A SKY COLORED LIKE FLAX BLOSSOMS SLEIGH BELLS CLINKED SHOUTS OF GREETING WERE LOUD IN THE THIN BRIGHT AIR
BUT WAS I MORE HAPPY WHEN I WAS DRUDGING I WAS NOT I WAS JUST BEDRAGGLED AND UNHAPPY IT'S WORK BUT NOT MY WORK I COULD RUN AN OFFICE OR A LIBRARY OR NURSE AND TEACH CHILDREN
ICICLES FROM BURST WATER PIPES HUNG ALONG THE SKIRT OF HIS BROWN DOG SKIN OVERCOAT HIS PLUSH CAP WHICH HE NEVER TOOK OFF IN THE HOUSE WAS A PULP OF ICE AND COAL DUST HIS RED HANDS WERE CRACKED TO RAWNESS
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
IN THE MID AFTERNOON OF THIS SAME DAY KENNICOTT WAS CALLED INTO THE COUNTRY IT WAS BEA'S EVENING OUT HER EVENING FOR THE LUTHERAN DANCE CAROL WAS ALONE FROM THREE TILL MIDNIGHT
SHE HAD SHE MEDITATED PASSED THROUGH THE NOVELTY OF SEEING THE TOWN AND MEETING PEOPLE OF SKATING AND SLIDING AND HUNTING BEA WAS COMPETENT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LABOR EXCEPT SEWING AND DARNING AND GOSSIPY ASSISTANCE TO BEA IN BED MAKING
AND MISTER STOWBODY A CAPITALIST BUT YOU BUSINESS MEN ARE GOING TO BEAT ALL THE REST OF US AT IT WITH YOUR SIMPLE HEARTED ENERGETIC POMPOUS SHE GOT SO FAR ONLY BECAUSE KENNICOTT WAS SLOW IN SHAKING OFF RESPECT FOR HER NOW HE BAYED
IN THE EARLY AUTUMN NEWS CAME FROM WAKAMIN THAT THE SHERIFF HAD FORBIDDEN AN ORGANIZER FOR THE NATIONAL NONPARTISAN LEAGUE TO SPEAK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTY THE ORGANIZER HAD DEFIED THE SHERIFF
THE POORER HOUSES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE THE SERVICES OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE A LUXURY WHICH INCLUDED THE SHANTY OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE BANKED TO THE LOWER WINDOWS WITH EARTH AND MANURE
THE WORLD WAS SO LUMINOUS THAT SHE SAT DOWN AT HER RICKETY LITTLE DESK IN THE LIVING ROOM TO MAKE A POEM SHE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE SKY IS BRIGHT THE SUN IS WARM THERE NE'ER WILL BE ANOTHER STORM
SHE DID NOT HUNT FOR THE SORT OF VEILING SHE WANTED SHE TOOK WHAT SHE COULD GET AND ONLY AT HOWLAND AND GOULD'S WAS THERE SUCH A LUXURY AS CANNED ASPARAGUS ROUTINE CARE WAS ALL SHE COULD DEVOTE TO THE HOUSE
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN
THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
THAT'LL BE ABOUT ALL FROM YOU I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR SNEERING AT THIS TOWN AND SAYING HOW UGLY AND DULL IT IS I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR REFUSING TO APPRECIATE GOOD FELLOWS LIKE SAM I'VE EVEN STOOD FOR YOUR RIDICULING OUR WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW CAMPAIGN
SHE FLED FROM THE THOUGHT WITH A DUBIOUS SOME DAY HER REFORMS HER IMPULSES TOWARD BEAUTY IN RAW MAIN STREET THEY HAD BECOME INDISTINCT BUT SHE WOULD SET THEM GOING NOW SHE WOULD
ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
STORM SHEDS WERE ERECTED AT EVERY DOOR IN EVERY BLOCK THE HOUSEHOLDERS SAM CLARK THE WEALTHY MISTER DAWSON ALL SAVE ASTHMATIC EZRA STOWBODY WHO EXTRAVAGANTLY HIRED A BOY
HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON BESIDES THE REPAIRMAN AT SAM CLARK'S WHO UNDERSTOOD PLUMBING EVERYBODY BEGGED HIM TO LOOK OVER THE FURNACE AND THE WATER PIPES HE RUSHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TILL AFTER BEDTIME TEN O'CLOCK
CANVAS JACKETS LINED WITH FLUFFY YELLOW WOOL LIKE THE PLUMAGE OF DUCKLINGS MOCCASINS RED FLANNEL WRISTLETS FOR THE BLAZING CHAPPED WRISTS OF BOYS THESE PROTECTIONS AGAINST WINTER WERE BUSILY DUG OUT OF MOTH BALL SPRINKLED DRAWERS
AND NOW I EXPECT YOU TO PLAY THE GAME
BUT IF YOU GO DEFENDING THESE FELLOWS THEN THE SAME THING APPLIES TO YOU NEXT THING I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE YAPPING ABOUT FREE SPEECH FREE SPEECH THERE'S TOO MUCH FREE SPEECH AND FREE GAS AND FREE BEER AND FREE LOVE
BUT SOLITARY DISH WASHING ISN'T ENOUGH TO SATISFY ME OR MANY OTHER WOMEN WE'RE GOING TO CHUCK IT WE'RE GOING TO WASH EM BY MACHINERY AND COME OUT AND PLAY WITH YOU MEN IN THE OFFICES AND CLUBS AND POLITICS YOU'VE CLEVERLY KEPT FOR YOURSELVES
AND TAR BAGS IN CLOSETS AND ALL OVER TOWN SMALL BOYS WERE SQUEALING OH THERE'S MY MITTENS OR LOOK AT MY SHOE PACKS THERE IS SO SHARP A DIVISION BETWEEN THE PANTING SUMMER AND THE STINGING WINTER OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
YES SHE GIVES ME COOKIES AND SHE TELLS ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD AUNTIE BOGART SAYS I'M GOING TO BE A PREACHER CAN I BE A PREACHER CAN I PREACH ABOUT THE DEAR LORD
THESE BUSINESS MEN FROM THEIR CRUSHING LABORS OF SITTING IN AN OFFICE SEVEN HOURS A DAY WOULD CALMLY RECOMMEND THAT I HAVE A DOZEN CHILDREN AS IT HAPPENS I'VE DONE THAT SORT OF THING
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
ALONG THE RAILROAD THE SECTIONS OF SNOW FENCE WHICH HAD BEEN STACKED ALL SUMMER IN ROMANTIC WOODEN TENTS OCCUPIED BY ROVING SMALL BOYS WERE SET UP TO PREVENT DRIFTS FROM COVERING THE TRACK
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING FOR I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS FOR A YEAR PERHAPS FOR A LIFETIME I SEE WELL OF COURSE I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO SELL OUT MY PRACTISE AND GO ANYWHERE YOU SAY
AND SEE WHAT THE EAST WAS LIKE IN WARTIME SHE SET OUT FOR WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER JUST BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SHE HAD DETERMINED ON WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT WAS LESS INTIMIDATING THAN THE OBVIOUS NEW YORK BECAUSE SHE HOPED TO FIND STREETS IN WHICH HUGH COULD PLAY
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
OH WE'RE HOPELESS WE DISSATISFIED WOMEN THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE US ABOUT THE PLACE TO FRET YOU SO IT'S FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I'M GOING OF COURSE A LITTLE THING LIKE HUGH MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT COMPLICATION DID YOU IN THIS OFF TO BOHEMIA AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AND FREE LOVE AND LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE STUFF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ME IF YOU CAN KEEP ME CAN YOU HE MOVED UNEASILY
LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
I'M TIRED OF PLAYING TRAIN LET'S PLAY SOMETHING ELSE LET'S GO SEE AUNTIE BOGART OH NO
THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS WHICH SHE COULD DO HAVE CHILDREN START HER CAREER OF REFORMING OR BECOME SO DEFINITELY A PART OF THE TOWN THAT SHE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF CHURCH AND STUDY CLUB AND BRIDGE PARTIES
WHY YOU SAY HE'S A ROUGHNECK AND YOU WON'T JUMP ON THE BAND WAGON ONCE WHEN KENNICOTT ANNOUNCED AT NOON DINNER
ONLY I CHOOSE TO MAKE MY OWN DEFINITION OF RUNNING AWAY I DON'T CALL DO YOU REALIZE HOW BIG A WORLD THERE IS BEYOND THIS GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE YOU'D KEEP ME ALL MY LIFE IT MAY BE THAT SOME DAY I'LL COME BACK BUT NOT TILL I CAN BRING SOMETHING MORE THAN I HAVE NOW
SHE COULDN'T SATISFY HER INGENUITY IN PLANNING MEALS AT DAHL AND OLESON'S MEAT MARKET YOU DIDN'T GIVE ORDERS YOU WOFULLY INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING TODAY BESIDES STEAK AND PORK AND HAM THE CUTS OF BEEF WERE NOT CUTS THEY WERE HACKS
GOPHER PRAIRIE IS LOST BACK THERE IN THE DUST AND STUBBLE AND I LOOK FORWARD SHE CONTINUED IT TO HUGH DARLING DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOTHER AND YOU ARE GOING TO FIND BEYOND THE BLUE HORIZON RIM WHAT
THE FARMERS CAME INTO TOWN IN HOME MADE SLEIGHS WITH BED QUILTS AND HAY PILED IN THE ROUGH BOXES FUR COATS FUR CAPS FUR MITTENS OVERSHOES BUCKLING ALMOST TO THE KNEES GRAY KNITTED SCARFS TEN FEET LONG THICK WOOLEN SOCKS
SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
BUT EVER SO MUCH SICKER ON NO COOKIES AT ALL THAT'S FOOLISH IT IS O MALE KENNICOTT HUH SAID KENNICOTT TWO AND WENT TO SLEEP ON HER SHOULDER
AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
AND KENNICOTT HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF HUMBLE AND COURT BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD THE DIM INJUSTICE OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY HIS SON LEFT HIM IRRITABLE HE FELT INJURED AN EVENT WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY TOUCH THEM BROUGHT DOWN HIS WRATH
AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER SKIING EXPEDITION RIGHT AWAY AND THEY JOLLILY RETURNED HOME AND NEVER THEREAFTER LEFT THEIR MANUALS OF BRIDGE CAROL WAS DISCOURAGED SHE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN KENNICOTT INVITED HER TO GO RABBIT HUNTING IN THE WOODS
WHEN THE BABY WAS ABED AND THEY SAT COMPOSEDLY IN CANVAS CHAIRS ON THE PORCH HE EXPERIMENTED
RINGING TO THE SKATES ON SHORE THE ICE TIPPED REEDS CLATTERED IN THE WIND AND OAK TWIGS WITH STUBBORN LAST LEAVES HUNG AGAINST A MILKY SKY HARRY HAYDOCK DID FIGURE EIGHTS AND CAROL WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT LIFE
HE CHEWED THE STUB OF A CIGAR BUT HE WAS COURTLY TO CAROL HE STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE FURNACE FLUES HE STRAIGHTENED GLANCED DOWN AT HER AND HEMMED GOT TO FIX YOUR FURNACE NO MATTER WHAT ELSE I DO
AND MY OWN SON REPROVES ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION BUT THE STORY DOESN'T GO RIGHT I'M NEITHER GROANING NOR BEING DRAMATICALLY SAVED I KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY AND I ENJOY IT I'M MAD WITH JOY OVER IT
BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED
AND THAT ITS GARRISON WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM BATTLE HE ADVANCED WITH HIS ARMY AGAINST THE TOWN SENDING TEN SHIPS TO SAIL ROUND INTO THE HARBOUR
IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW THE MARKETPLACE AND THE AMPHIPOLITANS HAVING ENCLOSED HIS TOMB EVER AFTERWARDS SACRIFICE TO HIM AS A HERO AND HAVE GIVEN TO HIM THE HONOUR OF GAMES AND ANNUAL OFFERINGS
TO RENEW THEIR OLD ATTEMPTS AT REVOLUTION BESIDES THIS AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT
MELIANS IT IS NATURAL AND EXCUSABLE FOR MEN IN OUR POSITION TO TURN MORE WAYS THAN ONE BOTH IN THOUGHT AND UTTERANCE HOWEVER THE QUESTION IN THIS CONFERENCE IS AS YOU SAY
AND A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY NUMBERING ALTOGETHER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED HELLENIC HORSE
SO THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT ARGOS AND ATHENS AT ONCE SHE ALSO SUSPECTED SOME OF THE CITIES IN PELOPONNESE OF INTENDING TO GO OVER TO THE ENEMY AND THAT WAS INDEED THE CASE
NOR BE LIKE THE VULGAR WHO ABANDONING SUCH SECURITY AS HUMAN MEANS MAY STILL AFFORD WHEN VISIBLE HOPES FAIL THEM IN EXTREMITY TURN TO INVISIBLE TO PROPHECIES AND ORACLES
HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
AS YOUR FALL WOULD BE A SIGNAL FOR THE HEAVIEST VENGEANCE AND AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD TO MEDITATE UPON ATHENIANS THE END OF OUR EMPIRE IF END IT SHOULD DOES NOT FRIGHTEN US
IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
NOR INDEED WOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO NOW IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN PRESSED BY A WAR WITH THE HIPPONIANS AND MEDMAEANS WHO LIVED ON THEIR BORDER AND WERE COLONISTS OF THEIRS PHAEAX MEANWHILE
THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE COME HERE IN THE INTEREST OF OUR EMPIRE AND THAT WE SHALL SAY WHAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO SAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF YOUR COUNTRY AS WE WOULD FAIN EXERCISE THAT EMPIRE
AS IF A SALLY WERE INTENDED UPON HEARING THIS HE WENT UP TO LOOK AND HAVING DONE SO BEING UNWILLING TO VENTURE UPON THE DECISIVE STEP OF A BATTLE BEFORE HIS REINFORCEMENTS CAME UP
AND HOW THE TOWN LAY ON THE SIDE OF THRACE HE THOUGHT TO RETIRE AT PLEASURE WITHOUT FIGHTING AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN UPON THE WALL OR COMING OUT OF THE GATES ALL OF WHICH WERE SHUT INDEED
ENCAMPING IN THEIR TERRITORY WITH THE ABOVE ARMAMENT BEFORE DOING ANY HARM TO THEIR LAND SENT ENVOYS TO NEGOTIATE THESE THE MELIANS DID NOT BRING BEFORE THE PEOPLE
THAN WHEN IT COMES AS THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE THIS IF YOU ARE WELL ADVISED YOU WILL GUARD AGAINST AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT DISHONOURABLE TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST CITY IN HELLAS
AND HELPING THEIR ENEMIES ATHENIANS THEN YOU DO NOT ADOPT THE VIEW THAT EXPEDIENCY GOES WITH SECURITY WHILE JUSTICE AND HONOUR CANNOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT DANGER
DESPISING THE SCANTY NUMBERS OF HIS OPPONENT WOULD MARCH AGAINST AMPHIPOLIS WITH THE FORCE THAT HE HAD GOT WITH HIM
HE RAN AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD WHERE THE TROPHY NOW STANDS AS YOU GO BY THE STEEPEST PART OF THE HILL AND FELL UPON AND ROUTED THE CENTRE OF THE ATHENIANS PANIC STRICKEN BY THEIR OWN DISORDER AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS AUDACITY
AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
THAT ARE MOST OF THEM YOUR OWN COLONISTS AND SOME CONQUERED REBELS ATHENIANS AS FAR AS RIGHT GOES THEY THINK ONE HAS AS MUCH OF IT AS THE OTHER AND THAT IF ANY MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE
HIS SOLDIERS TIRED OF THEIR INACTIVITY BEGAN ALSO SERIOUSLY TO REFLECT ON THE WEAKNESS AND INCOMPETENCE OF THEIR COMMANDER AND THE SKILL AND VALOUR THAT WOULD BE OPPOSED TO HIM AND ON THEIR OWN ORIGINAL UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCOMPANY HIM
BUT IT IS FOR THIS VERY REASON THAT WE NOW TRUST TO THEIR RESPECT FOR EXPEDIENCY TO PREVENT THEM FROM BETRAYING THE MELIANS THEIR COLONISTS AND THEREBY LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN HELLAS
AND OTHER SUCH INVENTIONS THAT DELUDE MEN WITH HOPES TO THEIR DESTRUCTION MELIANS
THAT HAS MADE THE ENEMY MARCH UP TO THE PLACE AND CARELESSLY LOOK ABOUT HIM AS HE IS DOING WITHOUT NOTICING US BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SOLDIER WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN WHO MOST HAPPILY DETECTS A BLUNDER LIKE THIS
SO WILL YOU BE MOST COMPLETELY DECEIVED THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS NOW RETURNED TO THE ARMY AND THE MELIANS SHOWING NO SIGNS OF YIELDING
HE RECEIVED A WOUND BUT HIS FALL WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY THE ATHENIANS
WHICH WAS INDEED THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE THIS HOWEVER NOT BEING QUICK ENOUGH FOR HIM HE JOINED THE RETREAT IN PERSON AND MADE THE RIGHT WING WHEEL ROUND THUS TURNING ITS UNARMED SIDE TO THE ENEMY
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF SUBMITTING BEFORE SUFFERING THE WORST AND WE SHOULD GAIN BY NOT DESTROYING YOU MELIANS SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT CONSENT TO OUR BEING NEUTRAL
THE ATHENIANS HEARING THIS SENT PHAEAX TO SEE IF THEY COULD NOT BY SOME MEANS SO CONVINCE THEIR ALLIES THERE AND THE REST OF THE SICILIANS OF THE AMBITIOUS DESIGNS OF SYRACUSE
KILLING SOME OF THE PELOPONNESIANS AND TORONAEANS IN THE MELEE AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THE REST AND PASITELIDAS THEIR COMMANDER AMONGST THEM
AND THEY REFUSED TO RENEW IT
HAVE THE MOST BRILLIANT NAME IN WAR THEREFORE WHILE THEIR CARELESS CONFIDENCE CONTINUES AND THEY ARE STILL THINKING AS IN MY JUDGMENT THEY ARE NOW DOING MORE OF RETREAT THAN OF MAINTAINING THEIR POSITION
AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
ONLY WHEN THEY ARE RUINED BUT SO LONG AS THE DISCOVERY WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GUARD AGAINST IT IT IS NEVER FOUND WANTING LET NOT THIS BE THE CASE WITH YOU WHO ARE WEAK AND HANG ON A SINGLE TURN OF THE SCALE
WHENCE HOWEVER THEY ALL CAME HOME AFTERWARDS THE PELOPONNESIANS ON THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE AND THE REST BY BEING EXCHANGED AGAINST OTHER PRISONERS WITH THE OLYNTHIANS ABOUT THE SAME TIME PANACTUM
CONCLUDING THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN POLLUTED BY SOME OLD OFFENCE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONSECRATION AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE OMISSION IN THE PREVIOUS PURIFICATION OF THE ISLAND WHICH AS I HAVE RELATED
WITH HONOUR AS THE PRIZE AND SHAME AS THE PENALTY BUT A QUESTION OF SELF PRESERVATION AND OF NOT RESISTING THOSE WHO ARE FAR STRONGER THAN YOU ARE MELIANS
AS IS LIKELY DEALING TERROR AMONG THEM TAKE WITH YOU THE AMPHIPOLITANS AND THE REST OF THE ALLIES AND SUDDENLY OPEN THE GATES AND DASH AT THEM AND HASTEN TO ENGAGE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THAT
WHOM THE ATHENIANS FORTHWITH LODGED IN THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS OF THEIR EMPIRE THE ATHENIANS ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISLE OF MELOS WITH THIRTY SHIPS OF THEIR OWN
AND FANCYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO RETIRE
HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
AND WHO CAREFULLY CONSULTING HIS OWN MEANS MAKES HIS ATTACK NOT SO MUCH BY OPEN AND REGULAR APPROACHES AS BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE MOMENT
REMAINED TO ARRANGE MATTERS AT AMPHIPOLIS
A FORTRESS ON THE ATHENIAN BORDER
MELIANS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERS TO SEND THE CRETAN SEA IS A WIDE ONE AND IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO COMMAND IT TO INTERCEPT OTHERS THAN FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO ELUDE THEM TO DO SO SAFELY
ARE THINGS THAT DO NOT NEED FURTHER COMMENT BUT THE PLAN OF ATTACK THAT I PROPOSE TO PURSUE THIS IT IS AS WELL TO EXPLAIN IN ORDER THAT THE FACT OF OUR ADVENTURING WITH A PART INSTEAD OF WITH THE WHOLE OF OUR FORCES
AND HAD ONLY ABOUT FOUR MILES MORE TO GO WHEN HE HEARD OF ITS FALL ON THE ROAD AND TURNED BACK AGAIN
AND ALSO ATTACKED THE ENEMY THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ATHENIANS SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED ON BOTH SIDES FELL INTO CONFUSION
AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST MELIANS AS WE THINK AT ANY RATE IT IS EXPEDIENT
SET SAIL WITH TWO COLLEAGUES AS AMBASSADOR FROM ATHENS TO ITALY AND SICILY
OR SLAVES OF ATHENS EVEN IF YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT PERSONAL LOSS OF LIBERTY OR LIFE YOUR BONDAGE WILL BE ON HARSHER TERMS THAN BEFORE AND YOU WILL ALSO HINDER THE LIBERATION OF THE REST OF THE HELLENES
OF THE GODS WE BELIEVE AND OF MEN WE KNOW THAT BY A NECESSARY LAW OF THEIR NATURE THEY RULE WHEREVER THEY CAN AND IT IS NOT AS IF WE WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE THIS LAW OR TO ACT UPON IT WHEN MADE
WHOM THEY CAME TO REINFORCE WAS DEAD THEY TURNED BACK HOME THINKING THAT THE MOMENT HAD GONE BY THE ATHENIANS BEING DEFEATED AND GONE AND THEMSELVES NOT EQUAL TO THE EXECUTION OF BRASIDAS'S DESIGNS
A QUARTER OF THE TOWN OF LEONTINI AND BRICINNIAE A STRONG PLACE IN THE LEONTINE COUNTRY AND BEING THERE JOINED BY MOST OF THE EXILED COMMONS CARRIED ON WAR FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ISLANDERS AND WEAKER THAN OTHERS RENDERING IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN BAFFLING THE MASTERS OF THE SEA MELIANS BUT DO YOU CONSIDER
IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF ESTABLISHING A PANIC AMONG THEM AS A FRESH ASSAILANT HAS ALWAYS MORE TERRORS FOR AN ENEMY THAN THE ONE HE IS IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED WITH SHOW YOURSELF A BRAVE MAN AS A SPARTAN SHOULD
SOME DIVERSION OF THE KIND YOU SPEAK OF YOU MAY ONE DAY EXPERIENCE ONLY TO LEARN AS OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT THE ATHENIANS NEVER ONCE YET WITHDREW FROM A SIEGE FOR FEAR OF ANY
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FORTUNE OF WAR IS SOMETIMES MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THE DISPROPORTION OF NUMBERS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE TO SUBMIT IS TO GIVE OURSELVES OVER TO DESPAIR
AND AT FIRST REMAINED NEUTRAL AND TOOK NO PART IN THE STRUGGLE BUT AFTERWARDS UPON THE ATHENIANS USING VIOLENCE AND PLUNDERING THEIR TERRITORY ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF OPEN HOSTILITY
LEAD THEM ON TO A POINT AT WHICH THEY BECOME SO ENSLAVED BY THE PHRASE AS IN FACT TO FALL WILFULLY INTO HOPELESS DISASTER AND INCUR DISGRACE MORE DISGRACEFUL AS THE COMPANION OF ERROR
WHO WAS TO BRING AS MANY THRACIAN MERCENARIES AS POSSIBLE
BUT THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS HAD ALREADY TAKEN TORONE
THE MELIANS ATTACKED BY NIGHT AND TOOK THE PART OF THE ATHENIAN LINES OVER AGAINST THE MARKET AND KILLED SOME OF THE MEN AND BROUGHT IN CORN AND ALL ELSE THAT THEY COULD FIND USEFUL TO THEM AND SO RETURNED AND KEPT QUIET
AND TWO LESBIAN VESSELS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED ARCHERS AND TWENTY MOUNTED ARCHERS FROM ATHENS AND ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ALLIES AND THE ISLANDERS
FIRST TOUCHING AT THE STILL BESIEGED SCIONE AND TAKING SOME HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ARMY THERE HE NEXT SAILED INTO COPHOS A HARBOUR IN THE TERRITORY OF TORONE WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN FROM THENCE
KNOWING THAT YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING THE SAME POWER AS WE HAVE WOULD DO THE SAME AS WE DO THUS AS FAR AS THE GODS ARE CONCERNED WE HAVE NO FEAR AND NO REASON TO FEAR THAT WE SHALL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE
QUICK SOMEONE AND OPEN THE GATES I SPOKE OF AND LET US BE OUT AND AT THEM WITH NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT ACCORDINGLY ISSUING OUT BY THE PALISADE GATE AND BY THE FIRST IN THE LONG WALL THEN EXISTING
AND SUBJECTS SMARTING UNDER THE YOKE WHO WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE A RASH STEP AND LEAD THEMSELVES AND US INTO OBVIOUS DANGER MELIANS WELL THEN
BUT BADE THEM STATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR MISSION TO THE MAGISTRATES AND THE FEW UPON WHICH THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS ATHENIANS SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT TO GO ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THE LATTER HAD FALLEN AND ONLY SEVEN OF THE ENEMY OWING TO THERE HAVING BEEN NO REGULAR ENGAGEMENT BUT THE AFFAIR OF ACCIDENT AND PANIC THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED AFTER TAKING UP THEIR DEAD THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF HOME
NO COWARDICE THEN ON YOUR PART SEEING THE GREATNESS OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE AND I WILL SHOW THAT WHAT I PREACH TO OTHERS I CAN PRACTISE MYSELF
WILL YOU BE SO BLINDED AS TO CHOOSE THE WORSE AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT YIELD TO THEIR EQUALS WHO KEEP TERMS WITH THEIR SUPERIORS AND ARE MODERATE TOWARDS THEIR INFERIORS ON THE WHOLE SUCCEED BEST
MIGHT PLUNDER THE ATHENIANS THE CORINTHIANS ALSO COMMENCED HOSTILITIES WITH THE ATHENIANS FOR PRIVATE QUARRELS OF THEIR OWN BUT THE REST OF THE PELOPONNESIANS STAYED QUIET MEANWHILE
AND DO YOU ALLIES FOLLOW HIM LIKE MEN AND REMEMBER THAT ZEAL HONOUR AND OBEDIENCE MARK THE GOOD SOLDIER
WHILE ACTION STILL PRESERVES FOR US A HOPE THAT WE MAY STAND ERECT ATHENIANS HOPE DANGER'S COMFORTER MAY BE INDULGED IN BY THOSE WHO HAVE ABUNDANT RESOURCES
OVER YOU WITHOUT TROUBLE AND SEE YOU PRESERVED FOR THE GOOD OF US BOTH MELIANS AND HOW PRAY COULD IT TURN OUT AS GOOD FOR US TO SERVE AS FOR YOU TO RULE ATHENIANS
MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN SEEN COMING DOWN FROM CERDYLIUM AND THEN IN THE CITY WHICH IS OVERLOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING NEAR THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE IN SHORT ALL HIS MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED
AND WORD WAS BROUGHT TO CLEON WHO HAD AT THE MOMENT GONE ON TO LOOK ABOUT HIM THAT THE WHOLE OF THE ENEMY'S FORCE COULD BE SEEN IN THE TOWN AND THAT THE FEET OF HORSES AND MEN IN GREAT NUMBERS WERE VISIBLE UNDER THE GATES
UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
STRIPPED THE DEAD AND SET UP A TROPHY
WHO FROM THE FIRST HAD NO THOUGHT OF FIGHTING AT ONCE FLED AND WAS OVERTAKEN AND SLAIN BY A MYRCINIAN TARGETEER
IN ORDER TO TAKE IN THE SUBURB TO DO WHICH HE HAD PULLED DOWN PART OF THE ORIGINAL WALL AND MADE IT ALL ONE CITY TO THIS POINT PASITELIDAS THE LACEDAEMONIAN COMMANDER
SHE SAW HER COUNTRY PLUNDERED FROM PYLOS AND CYTHERA THE HELOTS WERE DESERTING AND SHE WAS IN CONSTANT APPREHENSION THAT THOSE WHO REMAINED IN PELOPONNESE WOULD RELY UPON THOSE OUTSIDE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
HE NEVER DREAMED OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO FIGHT HIM BUT SAID THAT HE WAS RATHER GOING UP TO VIEW THE PLACE AND IF HE WAITED FOR HIS REINFORCEMENTS IT WAS NOT IN ORDER TO MAKE VICTORY SECURE IN CASE HE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ENGAGE
MAY NOT DAMP YOUR COURAGE BY THE APPARENT DISADVANTAGE AT WHICH IT PLACES YOU I IMAGINE IT IS THE POOR OPINION THAT HE HAS OF US AND THE FACT THAT HE HAS NO IDEA OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO ENGAGE HIM
PASITELIDAS BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT GET UP TO THE CITY BEFORE ITS DEFENDERS WERE THERE AND THE FORTIFICATION BEING ALSO CARRIED HE MIGHT BE TAKEN PRISONER AND SO ABANDONED THE OUTWORK AND RAN INTO THE TOWN
SINCE IN TOO MANY CASES THE VERY MEN THAT HAVE THEIR EYES PERFECTLY OPEN TO WHAT THEY ARE RUSHING INTO LET THE THING CALLED DISGRACE BY THE MERE INFLUENCE OF A SEDUCTIVE NAME
FOUND THE EVENT OF THE WAR TO FALSIFY HER NOTION THAT A FEW YEARS WOULD SUFFICE FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE POWER OF THE ATHENIANS BY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND SHE HAD SUFFERED ON THE ISLAND A DISASTER HITHERTO UNKNOWN AT SPARTA
THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE OF THE ALLIES WHO WHEN THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE SICILIANS TOOK PLACE HAD NOT MADE PEACE WITH HER
HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DULY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE DELIANS HAD ATRAMYTTIUM IN ASIA GIVEN THEM BY PHARNACES AND SETTLED THERE AS THEY REMOVED FROM DELOS MEANWHILE
WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUT TO TO TO ARM THEM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LESS CHANCE OF BEATING HIM THAN BY NOT LETTING HIM HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM AND THUS LEARN HOW GOOD A RIGHT HE HAD TO DESPISE THEM
THESE CONSIDERATIONS MADE BOTH SIDES DISPOSED FOR AN ACCOMMODATION THE LACEDAEMONIANS BEING PROBABLY THE MOST EAGER AS THEY ARDENTLY DESIRED TO RECOVER THE MEN TAKEN UPON THE ISLAND
WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
AND BROKE UP HIS CAMP AND ADVANCED THE TEMPER OF THE GENERAL WAS WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT PYLOS HIS SUCCESS ON THAT OCCASION HAVING GIVEN HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPACITY
WHAT IF YOU WHO SIT THERE WERE TO PURSUE A METHOD MORE CAUTIOUS STILL MAKE NO SET SPEECH YOURSELVES BUT TAKE US UP AT WHATEVER YOU DO NOT LIKE AND SETTLE THAT BEFORE GOING ANY FARTHER
AWAITING THEIR ARRIVAL INFORMED OF THIS
PELOPONNESIANS THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH WE HAVE COME ONE WHICH HAS ALWAYS OWED ITS FREEDOM TO VALOUR AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DORIANS AND THE ENEMY YOU ARE ABOUT TO FIGHT IONIANS WHOM YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEAT
AND DREW A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION ROUND THE MELIANS DIVIDING THE WORK AMONG THE DIFFERENT STATES SUBSEQUENTLY THE ATHENIANS RETURNED WITH MOST OF THEIR ARMY
THINKING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SUCH A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM ALONE IF THEIR REINFORCEMENTS WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO COME UP AND SO CALLING ALL HIS SOLDIERS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND EXPLAIN HIS INTENTION SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
THUS THE ATHENIAN ARMY WAS ALL NOW IN FLIGHT AND SUCH AS ESCAPED BEING KILLED IN THE BATTLE OR BY THE CHALCIDIAN HORSE AND THE TARGETEERS DISPERSED AMONG THE HILLS AND WITH DIFFICULTY
PROCEEDED ON HIS VOYAGE AND AT LENGTH ARRIVED AT ATHENS CLEON
THEY CONSTITUTED HIM THE FOUNDER OF THEIR COLONY AND PULLED DOWN THE HAGNONIC ERECTIONS AND OBLITERATED EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A MEMORIAL OF HIS HAVING FOUNDED THE PLACE
THE ATHENIAN RIGHT MADE A BETTER STAND
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
WHEN IT MAKES YOU THE MODERATE OFFER OF BECOMING ITS TRIBUTARY ALLY WITHOUT CEASING TO ENJOY THE COUNTRY THAT BELONGS TO YOU NOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE GIVEN YOU BETWEEN WAR AND SECURITY
WHILE THEIR SPIRIT IS SLACK AND NOT HIGH STRUNG WITH EXPECTATION I WITH THE MEN UNDER MY COMMAND WILL IF POSSIBLE TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND FALL WITH A RUN UPON THEIR CENTRE
ONE BY THE HARBOUR THE OTHER BY THE FORTIFICATION AND MAKING SLAVES OF THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF THE TORONAEANS SENT THE MEN WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS AND ANY CHALCIDIANS THAT WERE THERE TO THE NUMBER OF SEVEN HUNDRED TO ATHENS
MELIANS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FACE EVEN DANGER FOR OUR SAKE AND WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN FOR OTHERS AS OUR NEARNESS TO PELOPONNESE MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACT
WITH TWELVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AND THREE HUNDRED HORSE FROM ATHENS
THE NEXT SUMMER THE TRUCE FOR A YEAR ENDED AFTER LASTING UNTIL THE PYTHIAN GAMES DURING THE ARMISTICE THE ATHENIANS EXPELLED THE DELIANS FROM DELOS
THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ALLOWED IN DANGER TO INVOKE WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT AND EVEN TO PROFIT BY ARGUMENTS NOT STRICTLY VALID IF THEY CAN BE GOT TO PASS CURRENT AND YOU ARE AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS AS ANY
THAT THERE IS NO SECURITY IN THE POLICY WHICH WE INDICATE FOR HERE AGAIN IF YOU DEBAR US FROM TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE AND INVITE US TO OBEY YOUR INTEREST WE ALSO MUST EXPLAIN OURS
INDEED IT SO HAPPENED THAT DIRECTLY AFTER THE BATTLE OF AMPHIPOLIS AND THE RETREAT OF RAMPHIAS FROM THESSALY BOTH SIDES CEASED TO PROSECUTE THE WAR AND TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PEACE
WHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK MEASURES TO KEEP BETTER GUARD IN FUTURE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
AFTER REMAINING QUIET FOR SOME TIME
IF YOU RISK SO MUCH TO RETAIN YOUR EMPIRE AND YOUR SUBJECTS TO GET RID OF IT
CALLING TO HIS STANDARD FIFTEEN HUNDRED THRACIAN MERCENARIES AND ALL THE EDONIANS HORSE AND TARGETEERS HE ALSO HAD A THOUSAND MYRCINIAN AND CHALCIDIAN TARGETEERS BESIDES THOSE IN AMPHIPOLIS
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND DECEIVE THE EARS OF THE MULTITUDE BY SEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD PASS WITHOUT REFUTATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE FEW
THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ON THIS GLOBE FOR GOOD AT WHICH SOME PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE THEIR FILL OF LAUGHTER IN THE OUTSET AND KNOWING THAT SUCH AS THESE WOULD BE BLIND ANYWAY
BUT THEY HAVE A KEEN SCENT LIKE THE BEASTS AND ARE AWARE WHEN HUMAN BEINGS DRAW NEAR WHEN HANSEL AND GRETEL CAME INTO HER NEIGHBOURHOOD SHE LAUGHED WITH MALICE AND SAID MOCKINGLY
GET UP LAZY THING FETCH SOME WATER AND COOK SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOUR BROTHER HE IS IN THE STABLE OUTSIDE AND IS TO BE MADE FAT WHEN HE IS FAT I WILL EAT HIM
HALLO HERE HE WAS CHECKED IN HIS TRANSPORTS BY THE CHURCHES RINGING OUT THE LUSTIEST PEALS HE HAD EVER HEARD
HE WAS AT HOME IN FIVE MINUTES NOTHING COULD BE HEARTIER HIS NIECE LOOKED JUST THE SAME SO DID TOPPER WHEN HE CAME SO DID THE PLUMP SISTER WHEN SHE CAME SO DID EVERY ONE WHEN THEY CAME
HE TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW'S HOUSE HE PASSED THE DOOR A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO UP AND KNOCK BUT HE MADE A DASH AND DID IT
ALONG WITH MISTRESS I'LL SHOW YOU UP STAIRS IF YOU PLEASE THANK'EE HE KNOWS ME SAID SCROOGE WITH HIS HAND ALREADY ON THE DINING ROOM LOCK I'LL GO IN HERE MY DEAR HE TURNED IT GENTLY
STIRRING COLD COLD PIPING FOR THE BLOOD TO DANCE TO GOLDEN SUNLIGHT HEAVENLY SKY SWEET FRESH AIR MERRY BELLS
I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
JUST SIT THERE YOU CHILDREN AND WHEN YOU ARE TIRED YOU MAY SLEEP A LITTLE WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE DONE WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AWAY WHEN IT WAS NOON
MAKING THEM PARTIES TO EVERY KIND OF EXTRAVAGANCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO CRIED SCROOGE
BUT NOW WE MUST BE OFF SAID HANSEL THAT WE MAY GET OUT OF THE WITCH'S FOREST WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR TWO HOURS THEY CAME TO A GREAT STRETCH OF WATER WE CANNOT CROSS SAID HANSEL
IN HIS BED AND TOSSED ABOUT IN HIS ANXIETY HE GROANED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER HE BECAME
AND TEAR THEM TO PIECES O YOU FOOL SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU MAY AS WELL PLANE THE PLANKS FOR OUR COFFINS AND SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE
AND SHOWED THEM THE WAY THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND BY BREAK OF DAY CAME ONCE MORE TO THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE WOMAN OPENED IT AND SAW THAT IT WAS HANSEL AND GRETEL SHE SAID
APPLES AND NUTS AFTERWARDS TWO PRETTY LITTLE BEDS WERE COVERED WITH CLEAN WHITE LINEN AND HANSEL AND GRETEL LAY DOWN IN THEM AND THOUGHT THEY WERE IN HEAVEN THE OLD WOMAN
WHAT AN HONEST EXPRESSION IT HAS IN ITS FACE IT'S A WONDERFUL KNOCKER HERE'S THE TURKEY HALLO WHOOP HOW ARE YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS IT WAS A
WITH THEIR PLUMP AND ROSY CHEEKS SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF THAT WILL BE A DAINTY MOUTHFUL THEN SHE SEIZED HANSEL WITH HER SHRIVELLED HAND CARRIED HIM INTO A LITTLE STABLE
AND BROKE OFF A LITTLE OF THE ROOF TO TRY HOW IT TASTED AND GRETEL LEANT AGAINST THE WINDOW AND NIBBLED AT THE PANES THEN A SOFT VOICE CRIED FROM THE PARLOUR NIBBLE NIBBLE GNAW
TO MAKE AMENDS IN I WILL LIVE IN THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE SCROOGE REPEATED AS HE SCRAMBLED OUT OF BED THE SPIRITS OF ALL THREE SHALL STRIVE WITHIN ME
HE THOUGHT IT QUITE AS WELL THAT THEY SHOULD WRINKLE UP THEIR EYES IN GRINS AS HAVE THE MALADY IN LESS ATTRACTIVE FORMS HIS OWN HEART LAUGHED AND THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH FOR HIM
AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN AND THEREFORE I AM ABOUT TO RAISE YOUR SALARY BOB TREMBLED AND GOT A LITTLE NEARER TO THE RULER
SHE SHALL TAKE US ACROSS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE GOOD LITTLE DUCK DID SO AND WHEN THEY WERE ONCE SAFELY ACROSS AND HAD WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR TO THEM AND AT LENGTH
EARLY IN THE MORNING GRETEL HAD TO GO OUT AND HANG UP THE CAULDRON WITH THE WATER AND LIGHT THE FIRE WE WILL BAKE FIRST SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE ALREADY HEATED THE OVEN
AND I WILL LIGHT A FIRE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE COLD HANSEL AND GRETEL GATHERED BRUSHWOOD TOGETHER AS HIGH AS A LITTLE HILL THE BRUSHWOOD WAS LIGHTED AND WHEN THE FLAMES WERE BURNING VERY HIGH THE WOMAN SAID
AND SIDLED HIS FACE IN ROUND THE DOOR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS SPREAD OUT IN GREAT ARRAY FOR THESE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS ON SUCH POINTS AND LIKE TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FRED
AND WANTS TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME ANSWERED HANSEL FOOL SAID THE WOMAN THAT IS NOT YOUR LITTLE PIGEON THAT IS THE MORNING SUN THAT IS SHINING ON THE CHIMNEY HANSEL HOWEVER LITTLE BY LITTLE THREW ALL THE CRUMBS
BUT A BRANCH WHICH HE HAD FASTENED TO A WITHERED TREE WHICH THE WIND WAS BLOWING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND AS THEY HAD BEEN SITTING SUCH A LONG TIME THEIR EYES CLOSED WITH FATIGUE AND THEY FELL FAST ASLEEP
DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF I WILL SOON FIND A WAY TO HELP US AND WHEN THE OLD FOLKS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS LITTLE COAT OPENED THE DOOR BELOW AND CREPT OUTSIDE
AND HAD HEARD WHAT THEIR STEPMOTHER HAD SAID TO THEIR FATHER GRETEL WEPT BITTER TEARS AND SAID TO HANSEL NOW ALL IS OVER WITH US BE QUIET GRETEL SAID HANSEL
THE WOMAN LED THE CHILDREN STILL DEEPER INTO THE FOREST WHERE THEY HAD NEVER IN THEIR LIVES BEEN BEFORE THEN A GREAT FIRE WAS AGAIN MADE AND THE MOTHER SAID
AND LOCKED HIM IN BEHIND A GRATED DOOR SCREAM AS HE MIGHT IT WOULD NOT HELP HIM THEN SHE WENT TO GRETEL SHOOK HER TILL SHE AWOKE AND CRIED
HAD ONLY PRETENDED TO BE SO KIND SHE WAS IN REALITY A WICKED WITCH WHO LAY IN WAIT FOR CHILDREN AND HAD ONLY BUILT THE LITTLE HOUSE OF BREAD IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM THERE
WE HAVE ONE HALF LOAF LEFT AND THAT IS THE END THE CHILDREN MUST GO WE WILL TAKE THEM FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
STARTING OFF AGAIN AND GOING ROUND THE FIREPLACE THERE'S THE DOOR BY WHICH THE GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY ENTERED THERE'S THE CORNER WHERE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT SAT
OH THEN SHE BEGAN TO HOWL QUITE HORRIBLY BUT GRETEL RAN AWAY AND THE GODLESS WITCH WAS MISERABLY BURNT TO DEATH GRETEL HOWEVER RAN LIKE LIGHTNING TO HANSEL
THESE ARE FAR BETTER THAN PEBBLES SAID HANSEL AND THRUST INTO HIS POCKETS WHATEVER COULD BE GOT IN AND GRETEL SAID I TOO WILL TAKE SOMETHING HOME WITH ME AND FILLED HER PINAFORE FULL
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL
THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE CHILDREN WERE AWAKE SHE WAS ALREADY UP AND WHEN SHE SAW BOTH OF THEM SLEEPING AND LOOKING SO PRETTY
I KNOW THEY WILL HIS HANDS WERE BUSY WITH HIS GARMENTS ALL THIS TIME TURNING THEM INSIDE OUT PUTTING THEM ON UPSIDE DOWN TEARING THEM MISLAYING THEM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING HERE AT THIS TIME OF DAY I AM VERY SORRY SIR SAID BOB I AM BEHIND MY TIME YOU ARE REPEATED SCROOGE YES I THINK YOU ARE
THAT THEY LET FALL WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR HANDS THE OLD WOMAN HOWEVER NODDED HER HEAD AND SAID OH YOU DEAR CHILDREN WHO HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE DO COME IN AND STAY WITH ME
TO WHERE IT IS THE THICKEST THERE WE WILL LIGHT A FIRE FOR THEM AND GIVE EACH OF THEM ONE MORE PIECE OF BREAD AND THEN WE WILL GO TO OUR WORK AND LEAVE THEM ALONE THEY WILL NOT FIND THE WAY HOME AGAIN
AS GOOD A FRIEND AS GOOD A MASTER AND AS GOOD A MAN AS THE GOOD OLD CITY KNEW
AND KNEADED THE DOUGH SHE PUSHED POOR GRETEL OUT TO THE OVEN FROM WHICH FLAMES OF FIRE WERE ALREADY DARTING CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS PROPERLY HEATED
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS
THERE'S THE WINDOW WHERE I SAW THE WANDERING SPIRITS IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
IS YOUR MASTER AT HOME MY DEAR SAID SCROOGE TO THE GIRL NICE GIRL VERY YES SIR WHERE IS HE MY LOVE SAID SCROOGE HE'S IN THE DINING ROOM SIR

WHY BLESS MY SOUL CRIED FRED WHO'S THAT IT'S I YOUR UNCLE SCROOGE I HAVE COME TO DINNER WILL YOU LET ME IN FRED LET HIM IN
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL
GRETEL BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN FOR SHE WAS FORCED TO DO WHAT THE WICKED WITCH COMMANDED AND NOW THE BEST FOOD WAS COOKED FOR POOR HANSEL BUT GRETEL
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS SAID SCROOGE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN AMONG THE SPIRITS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING I'M QUITE A BABY NEVER MIND I DON'T CARE
AND WE SHALL BE RID OF THEM NO WIFE SAID THE MAN I WILL NOT DO THAT HOW CAN I BEAR TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN ALONE IN THE FOREST THE WILD ANIMALS WOULD SOON COME
AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE KITCHENS OF HOUSES AND UP TO THE WINDOWS AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING COULD YIELD HIM PLEASURE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT ANY WALK THAT ANYTHING COULD GIVE HIM SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE AFTERNOON
GLORIOUS RUNNING TO THE WINDOW HE OPENED IT AND PUT OUT HIS HEAD NO FOG NO MIST CLEAR BRIGHT JOVIAL
YOU NAUGHTY CHILDREN WHY HAVE YOU SLEPT SO LONG IN THE FOREST WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK AT ALL THE FATHER HOWEVER REJOICED FOR IT HAD CUT HIM TO THE HEART TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND ALONE
IT SENT A PANG ACROSS HIS HEART TO THINK HOW THIS OLD GENTLEMAN WOULD LOOK UPON HIM WHEN THEY MET BUT HE KNEW WHAT PATH LAY STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND HE TOOK IT
NO HARM SHALL HAPPEN TO YOU SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER LITTLE HOUSE THEN GOOD FOOD WAS SET BEFORE THEM MILK AND PANCAKES WITH SUGAR
WHO IS NIBBLING AT MY LITTLE HOUSE THE CHILDREN ANSWERED THE WIND THE WIND THE HEAVEN BORN WIND AND WENT ON EATING WITHOUT DISTURBING THEMSELVES
THEY SET OUT BUT THEY FOUND NO CRUMBS FOR THE MANY THOUSANDS OF BIRDS WHICH FLY ABOUT IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS HAD PICKED THEM ALL UP HANSEL SAID TO GRETEL WE SHALL SOON FIND THE WAY BUT THEY DID NOT FIND IT
YOU MUST HAVE A CAB THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAID THIS AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE TURKEY AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE CAB AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE RECOMPENSED THE BOY
IF THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST HAD BUT DEVOURED US WE SHOULD AT ANY RATE HAVE DIED TOGETHER JUST KEEP YOUR NOISE TO YOURSELF SAID THE OLD WOMAN IT WON'T HELP YOU AT ALL
NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THERE WAS ONCE MORE GREAT DEARTH THROUGHOUT THE LAND AND THE CHILDREN HEARD THEIR MOTHER SAYING AT NIGHT TO THEIR FATHER
TURKEY HE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS THAT BIRD HE WOULD HAVE SNAPPED EM SHORT OFF IN A MINUTE LIKE STICKS OF SEALING WAX WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THAT TO CAMDEN TOWN SAID SCROOGE
GOT NOTHING BUT CRAB SHELLS EVERY MORNING THE WOMAN CREPT TO THE LITTLE STABLE AND CRIED HANSEL STRETCH OUT YOUR FINGER THAT I MAY FEEL IF YOU WILL SOON BE FAT HANSEL HOWEVER
THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE STILL AWAKE AND HAD HEARD THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE OLD FOLKS WERE ASLEEP HANSEL AGAIN GOT UP AND WANTED TO GO OUT AND PICK UP PEBBLES AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
AS HE STOOD THERE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL THE KNOCKER CAUGHT HIS EYE I SHALL LOVE IT AS LONG AS I LIVE CRIED SCROOGE PATTING IT WITH HIS HAND I SCARCELY EVER LOOKED AT IT BEFORE
AND HE DID IT YES HE DID THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE NO BOB A QUARTER PAST NO BOB
THE HAND IN WHICH HE WROTE THE ADDRESS WAS NOT A STEADY ONE BUT WRITE IT HE DID SOMEHOW AND WENT DOWN STAIRS TO OPEN THE STREET DOOR READY FOR THE COMING OF THE POULTERER'S MAN
WHEN AT LAST THEY AWOKE IT WAS ALREADY DARK NIGHT GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID HOW ARE WE TO GET OUT OF THE FOREST NOW BUT HANSEL COMFORTED HER AND SAID JUST WAIT A LITTLE
AND BEEN QUITE SATISFIED HE DRESSED HIMSELF ALL IN HIS BEST AND AT LAST GOT OUT INTO THE STREETS THE PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME POURING FORTH
THEY SAW FROM AFAR THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN RUSHED INTO THE PARLOUR AND THREW THEMSELVES ROUND THEIR FATHER'S NECK THE MAN HAD NOT KNOWN ONE HAPPY HOUR SINCE HE HAD LEFT THE CHILDREN IN THE FOREST
AND DANCE ABOUT AND KISS EACH OTHER AND AS THEY HAD NO LONGER ANY NEED TO FEAR HER THEY WENT INTO THE WITCH'S HOUSE AND IN EVERY CORNER THERE STOOD CHESTS FULL OF PEARLS AND JEWELS
DRIVING AWAY WITH HIS PEN AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO OVERTAKE NINE O'CLOCK HALLO GROWLED SCROOGE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED VOICE AS NEAR AS HE COULD FEIGN IT
BUT SCOLDED AND REPROACHED HIM HE WHO SAYS A MUST SAY B LIKEWISE AND AS HE HAD YIELDED THE FIRST TIME HE HAD TO DO SO A SECOND TIME ALSO
THEN HE WENT BACK AND SAID TO GRETEL BE COMFORTED DEAR LITTLE SISTER AND SLEEP IN PEACE GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE US AND HE LAY DOWN AGAIN IN HIS BED WHEN DAY DAWNED
AND AS THEY WERE SO WEARY THAT THEIR LEGS WOULD CARRY THEM NO LONGER THEY LAY DOWN BENEATH A TREE AND FELL ASLEEP IT WAS NOW THREE MORNINGS SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THE BREAD IN AND ONCE GRETEL WAS INSIDE SHE INTENDED TO SHUT THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE IN IT AND THEN SHE WOULD EAT HER TOO BUT GRETEL SAW WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND AND SAID
I SAY IT ON MY KNEES OLD JACOB ON MY KNEES HE WAS SO FLUTTERED AND SO GLOWING WITH HIS GOOD INTENTIONS THAT HIS BROKEN VOICE WOULD SCARCELY ANSWER TO HIS CALL
OF COURSE THEY CAN OF COURSE THEY CAN HALLO MY FINE FELLOW
IT'S A PLEASURE TO TALK TO HIM YES MY BUCK IT'S HANGING THERE NOW REPLIED THE BOY IS IT SAID SCROOGE GO AND BUY IT WALK ER EXCLAIMED THE BOY
THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY TOO FROM MORNING TILL EVENING BUT THEY DID NOT GET OUT OF THE FOREST AND WERE VERY HUNGRY FOR THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT TWO OR THREE BERRIES WHICH GREW ON THE GROUND
I AM AS MERRY AS A SCHOOLBOY I AM AS GIDDY AS A DRUNKEN MAN A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYBODY A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL THE WORLD HALLO HERE WHOOP
THE DUCK CAME TO THEM AND HANSEL SEATED HIMSELF ON ITS BACK AND TOLD HIS SISTER TO SIT BY HIM NO REPLIED GRETEL THAT WILL BE TOO HEAVY FOR THE LITTLE DUCK
WERE ONLY TO BE EXCEEDED BY THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND CHUCKLED TILL HE CRIED SHAVING WAS NOT AN EASY TASK
STEP THIS WAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR
HOW ARE WE TO FEED OUR POOR CHILDREN WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING EVEN FOR OURSELVES I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HUSBAND ANSWERED THE WOMAN EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT INTO THE FOREST
LITTLE DUCK LITTLE DUCK DOST THOU SEE HANSEL AND GRETEL ARE WAITING FOR THEE THERE'S NEVER A PLANK OR BRIDGE IN SIGHT TAKE US ACROSS ON THY BACK SO WHITE
AS HE HAD SEEN THEM WITH THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND WALKING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM SCROOGE REGARDED EVERY ONE WITH A DELIGHTED SMILE HE LOOKED SO IRRESISTIBLY PLEASANT IN A WORD
YES AND THE BEDPOST WAS HIS OWN THE BED WAS HIS OWN THE ROOM WAS HIS OWN BEST AND HAPPIEST OF ALL THE TIME BEFORE HIM WAS HIS OWN
WHO HAD DIM EYES COULD NOT SEE IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS HANSEL'S FINGER AND WAS ASTONISHED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF FATTENING HIM WHEN FOUR WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND HANSEL STILL REMAINED THIN
A GREAT MANY BACK PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN IT I ASSURE YOU WILL YOU DO ME THAT FAVOUR MY DEAR SIR SAID THE OTHER SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SUCH MUNIFI
SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED AND A WOMAN AS OLD AS THE HILLS WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF ON CRUTCHES CAME CREEPING OUT HANSEL AND GRETEL WERE SO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
IF HE COULD ONLY BE THERE FIRST AND CATCH BOB CRATCHIT COMING LATE
SCROOGE SAT WITH HIS DOOR WIDE OPEN THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIM COME INTO THE TANK HIS HAT WAS OFF BEFORE HE OPENED THE DOOR HIS COMFORTER TOO HE WAS ON HIS STOOL IN A JIFFY
UNTIL THE MOON HAS RISEN AND THEN WE WILL SOON FIND THE WAY AND WHEN THE FULL MOON HAD RISEN HANSEL TOOK HIS LITTLE SISTER BY THE HAND AND FOLLOWED THE PEBBLES WHICH SHONE LIKE NEWLY COINED SILVER PIECES
WHEN A CHILD FELL INTO HER POWER SHE KILLED IT COOKED AND ATE IT AND THAT WAS A FEAST DAY WITH HER WITCHES HAVE RED EYES AND CANNOT SEE FAR
OPENED HIS LITTLE STABLE AND CRIED HANSEL WE ARE SAVED THE OLD WITCH IS DEAD THEN HANSEL SPRANG LIKE A BIRD FROM ITS CAGE WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED HOW THEY DID REJOICE AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER
DON'T SAY ANYTHING PLEASE RETORTED SCROOGE COME AND SEE ME WILL YOU COME AND SEE ME I WILL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND IT WAS CLEAR HE MEANT TO DO IT THANK'EE SAID SCROOGE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
LORD BLESS ME CRIED THE GENTLEMAN AS IF HIS BREATH WERE TAKEN AWAY MY DEAR MISTER SCROOGE ARE YOU SERIOUS IF YOU PLEASE SAID SCROOGE NOT A FARTHING LESS
TOWN OR BOROUGH IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD SOME PEOPLE LAUGHED TO SEE THE ALTERATION IN HIM BUT HE LET THEM LAUGH AND LITTLE HEEDED THEM FOR HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
THE WOMAN HOWEVER WAS DEAD GRETEL EMPTIED HER PINAFORE UNTIL PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES RAN ABOUT THE ROOM AND HANSEL THREW ONE HANDFUL AFTER ANOTHER OUT OF HIS POCKET TO ADD TO THEM
HE HAD A MOMENTARY IDEA OF KNOCKING SCROOGE DOWN WITH IT HOLDING HIM AND CALLING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT FOR HELP AND A STRAIT WAISTCOAT A MERRY CHRISTMAS BOB SAID SCROOGE
BUT THE SONG THAT ONCE HAD TROUBLED THE STARS WENT MOANING ON AWAKING PENT DESIRES TILL FULL AT THE FEET OF THE GODS THE MELODY FELL THEN THE BLUE RIVERS THAT LAY CURLED ASLEEP OPENED THEIR GLEAMING EYES UNCURLED THEMSELVES AND SHOOK THEIR RUSHES
CALLING THE SOUTH WIND TO THEM AND AGAIN THE GODS SHOUTED ALL TOGETHER MAKING THE CRY OF THE NORTH CALLING THE NORTH WIND TO THEM AND THUS THEY GATHERED TO THEM ALL THEIR WINDS
AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
AND IN HIS MIGHTY TREASURY TURNED OVER GEMS AND PEARLS AND LORDED IT OVER THE SEA AND SHE SAID O SLID WHOSE SOUL IS IN THE SEA BRING BACK MY GOLDEN BALL AND SLID STOOD UP SWARTHY AND CLAD IN SEAWEED
NOR YET TO THE TALES OF TEMPLES IN LONE LANDS THAT THE EAST WIND TOLD HER WHO HAD STOOD BESIDE HER WHEN SHE FLUNG HER GOLDEN BALL BUT FROM FAR AWAY THE WEST WIND CAME WITH NEWS OF THREE GREY TRAVELLERS WRAPT ROUND WITH BATTERED CLOAKS
I HAD NO OTHER OBJECT THAN TO TURN A SLIGHT THING WHICH TO MY SURPRISE SEEMS TO TROUBLE YOU TOO MUCH ASIDE I DECLARE TO YOU ON THE FAITH OF A GENTLEMAN THAT I HAVE LONG DISMISSED IT FROM MY MIND GOOD HEAVEN WHAT WAS THERE TO DISMISS
THE NIGHT HATH SEIZED MY GOLDEN BALL AND NO GOD ALONE CAN FIND IT NOW FOR NONE CAN SAY HOW FAR THE NIGHT MAY ROAM WHO PROWLS ALL ROUND US AND OUT BEYOND THE WORLDS AT THE ENTREATY OF THEIR DAWNCHILD
AND THE LAW BEFORE THE BEGINNING AND THEREAFTER WAS THAT ALL SHOULD OBEY THE GODS YET HITHER AND THITHER WENT ALL PEGANA'S GODS TO OBEY THE DAWNCHILD BECAUSE SHE LOVED TO BE OBEYED IT WAS DARK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND EVEN IN PEGANA WHERE DWELL THE GODS
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
AND MAKING A STIR AMONG THE HILLS CREPT DOWN TO FIND THE SEA AND PASSING ACROSS THE WORLD THEY CAME AT LAST TO WHERE THE WHITE CLIFFS STOOD AND COMING BEHIND THEM SPLIT THEM HERE AND THERE AND WENT THROUGH THEIR BROKEN RANKS TO SLID AT LAST
TO FIND WHAT THING IT WAS THAT CALLED WITH THE NEW CRY AND TO DRIVE IT AWAY FROM THE GODS THEN ALL THE WINDS HARNESSED UP THEIR CLOUDS AND DRAVE FORTH TILL THEY CAME TO THE GREAT GREEN VALLEY THAT DIVIDES THE SOUTH IN TWAIN
THAT HAS COME UPON THE EARTH AND HAVE STRIVEN AGAINST ITS ARMIES BUT COULD NOT DRIVE THEM FORTH AND THE NEW THING IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY ANGRY AND IS CREEPING TOWARDS THE GODS
AND THEREAFTER FASHIONED FIELDS AND HOLLOWS VALLEYS AND OTHER HILLS TO LIE ABOUT THY FEET AND NOW TINTAGGON THINE ANCIENT LORDS THE GODS ARE FACING A NEW THING WHICH OVERTHROWS THE OLD GO THEREFORE THOU TINTAGGON AND STAND UP AGAINST SLID
AND STREAMED AROUND HIS FLANKS AND THEN FELL AND WAS LOST TINTAGGON STILL STOOD FIRM FOR THE HONOUR AND DOMINION OF HIS LORDS THE ELDER GODS THEN SLID WENT TO TINTAGGON AND SAID LET US NOW MAKE A TRUCE
HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS COULD DWELL IN THE THOUGHTS OF HIS FAIR YOUNG WIFE BUT WHEN HE AFTERWARDS JOINED HER IN THEIR OWN ROOMS HE FOUND HER WAITING FOR HIM WITH THE OLD PRETTY LIFTING OF THE FOREHEAD STRONGLY MARKED WE ARE THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT SAID DARNAY DRAWING HIS ARM ABOUT HER
YES DEAREST CHARLES WITH HER HANDS ON HIS BREAST AND THE INQUIRING AND ATTENTIVE EXPRESSION FIXED UPON HIM WE ARE RATHER THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT FOR WE HAVE SOMETHING ON OUR MIND TO NIGHT WHAT IS IT MY LUCIE
AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
FAR OUT BEYOND THE BATTERED SHORE THAT LAY AT TINTAGGON'S FEET SLID RESTED LONG AND SENT THE NAUTILUS TO DRIFT UP AND DOWN BEFORE TINTAGGON'S EYES AND HE AND HIS ARMIES SAT SINGING IDLE SONGS OF DREAMY ISLANDS FAR AWAY TO THE SOUTH
AND HIS OTHER HAND AGAINST THE HEART THAT BEAT FOR HIM I THINK CHARLES POOR MISTER CARTON DESERVES MORE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAN YOU EXPRESSED FOR HIM TO NIGHT INDEED MY OWN WHY SO THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME
AND OF THE STILL STARS WHENCE THEY HAD STOLEN FORTH
AND ON THAT MORNING THE MIGHT OF ALL FIVE OCEANS LAY DEAD AT TINTAGGON'S FEET THAT WHICH SLID HAD CONQUERED HE STILL HELD AND THERE IS NOW NO LONGER A GREAT GREEN VALLEY IN THE SOUTH
AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED FROM HIS LIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND SLID SHALL DIVE FROM THE THRESHOLD INTO THE SEA
AND INZANA SAT AND LISTENED AND THOUGHT OF NO GOLDEN BALL NOR EVER OF CHALCEDONY AND ONYX NOR OF ALL HER FATHERS THE GODS BUT ONLY OF ALL THE BIRDS THEN IN THE WOODS AND MEADOWS WHERE THEY HAD ALL SUDDENLY SUNG THEY SUDDENLY CEASED
CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
AND AGAIN SLID CALLED UP OUT OF HIS DEEP A MIGHTY ARRAY OF WAVES AND SENT THEM ROARING AGAINST THE GUARDIANS OF THE GODS AND THE RED ROCKS FROWNED AND SMOTE THEM AND ONCE AGAIN SLID GATHERED HIS GREATER WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS
ALWAYS AND VERY LENIENT ON HIS FAULTS WHEN HE IS NOT BY I WOULD ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A HEART HE VERY VERY SELDOM REVEALS AND THAT THERE ARE DEEP WOUNDS IN IT MY DEAR I HAVE SEEN IT BLEEDING IT IS A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME
THEN UNDER THE WORLD WENT UMBORODOM WITH HIS THUNDER PANTING BEHIND HIM AND CAME IN THE DARK BEFORE THE MORNING FROM UNDERNEATH THE WORLD AND GAVE THE DAWNCHILD BACK HER GOLDEN BALL
ON THE FURTHEST EDGE OF THE WORLDS AND THOU AND I ARE TO BE EQUAL LORDS WHEN THE OLD GODS ARE GONE AND THE GREEN EARTH KNOWETH SLID BEHOLD ME GLEAMING AZURE AND FAIR WITH A THOUSAND SMILES AND SWAYED BY A THOUSAND MOODS AND TINTAGGON ANSWERED
THEN SLID SENT SOME OF HIS SMALLER WAVES TO SEARCH OUT WHAT STOOD AGAINST HIM AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM BUT SLID WENT BACK AND GATHERED TOGETHER A HOARD OF HIS GREATEST WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM
WAS YET THE SADDEST AT THE DAWNCHILD'S GRIEF AND WHEN THE GODS SAID PLAY WITH YOUR SILVER MOON
AND CAST THE BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD OF THE GODS TO THE LITTLE HUMAN CHILD THAT PLAYED IN THE FIELDS BELOW AND WOULD ONE DAY DIE AND THE CHILD PLAYED ALL DAY LONG WITH THE GOLDEN BALL DOWN IN THE LITTLE FIELDS WHERE THE HUMANS LIVED
AND THE PEOPLE OF SLID THE FISHES AND THE LONG EELS WENT IN AND OUT OF ARBOURS THAT ONCE WERE DEAR TO THE GODS THEN THE GODS FEARED FOR THEIR DOMINION AND TO THE INNERMOST SACRED RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HILLS THE GODS TROOPED OFF TOGETHER
AND OVER THE BROKEN REMNANTS OF THOSE RED CLIFFS THE ARMIES OF SLID MARCHED ON AND UP THE LONG GREEN VALLEY THEN THE GODS HEARD SLID EXULTING FAR AWAY AND SINGING SONGS OF TRIUMPH OVER THEIR BATTERED CLIFFS
AND THE EARTHQUAKE STARTED TO HIS FEET AND FLUNG THE CAVE AWAY THE CAVE WHEREIN HE SLEPT BETWEEN THE CLIFFS AND SHOOK HIMSELF AND WENT GALLOPING ABROAD AND OVERTURNED THE MOUNTAINS THAT HID THE GOLDEN BALL
AND I WILL DECK THEE WITH ALL THE ROBES OF THE SEA AND ALL THE PLUNDER THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN RARE CITIES SHALL BE PILED BEFORE THY FEET TINTAGGON I HAVE CONQUERED ALL THE STARS MY SONG SWELLS THROUGH ALL THE SPACE BESIDES I COME VICTORIOUS FROM MAHN AND KHANAGAT
UP THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS SHE CAST AGAIN HER GOLDEN BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD AFAR INTO THE BLUE TO GLADDEN THE WORLD AND THE SKY AND LAUGHED TO SEE IT GO
AND ALL WENT MARCHING ON TO ASSAIL THE CLIFFS OF THE GODS AND WHEREVER THE RIVERS HAD BROKEN THE RANKS OF THE CLIFFS
BUT ALL THAT TINTAGGON HAD GUARDED AGAINST SLID HE GAVE BACK TO THE GODS VERY CALM THE SEA LIES NOW ABOUT TINTAGGON'S FEET WHERE HE STANDS ALL BLACK AMID CRUMBLED CLIFFS OF WHITE WITH RED ROCKS PILED ABOUT HIS FEET
AND SLID HIMSELF SEIZED HOLD OF HUGE ROCKS WITH HIS CLAWS AND TORE THEM DOWN AND STAMPED THEM UNDER HIS FEET AND WHEN THE TUMULT WAS OVER THE SEA HAD WON
AND OFTEN THE SEA RETREATS FAR OUT ALONG THE SHORE AND OFTEN WAVE BY WAVE COMES MARCHING IN WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRAMPING OF ARMIES THAT ALL MAY STILL REMEMBER THE GREAT FIGHT THAT SURGED ABOUT TINTAGGON ONCE WHEN HE GUARDED THE GODS AND THE GREEN EARTH AGAINST SLID
STOLE OUT OF PEGANA AND CREPT ACROSS THE SKY AND FOUND THE BIRDS OF ALL THE WORLD SITTING IN TREES AND IVY AND WHISPERING IN THE DARK HE ASKED THEM ONE BY ONE FOR NEWS OF THE GOLDEN BALL
DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
AND UMBORODOM WENT BACK INTO PEGANA AND AT ITS THRESHOLD THE THUNDER WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN THE DAWNCHILD TOSSED THE GOLDEN BALL FAR UP INTO THE BLUE ACROSS THE SKY AND THE SECOND MORNING SHONE UPON THE WORLD
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
BUT TOWARDS EVENING CERTAIN MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF CONSPIRED TOGETHER TO STAND BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE GOLDEN BALL AND TO WRAP THEIR CRAGS ABOUT IT AND TO SHUT IT FROM THE WORLD AND ALL THE WORLD WAS DARKENED WITH THEIR PLOT AND THE DAWNCHILD UP IN PEGANA CRIED FOR HER GOLDEN BALL
AND THE CHILD CRIED AND THREW IT UPON THE STAIRWAY AND CHIPPED AND BROKE ITS EDGES AND ASKED FOR THE GOLDEN BALL AND LIMPANG TUNG
HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING DARNAY ASIDE INTO A WINDOW AND OF SPEAKING TO HIM WHEN NO ONE OVERHEARD MISTER DARNAY SAID CARTON
AND CAREFULLY SHE WATCHED IT AS IT FELL BUT ALAS IT FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO THE GREAT SEA AND GLEAMED AND SHIMMERED AS IT FELL TILL THE WATERS BECAME DARK ABOVE IT AND COULD BE SEEN NO MORE AND MEN ON THE WORLD SAID
BUT HAUGHTY AND SILENT STOOD THE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PLOT HAD DARKENED THE WORLD ALL IN THE DARK AMONG THE CRAGS IN A MIGHTY CAVERN GUARDED BY TWO TWIN PEAKS AT LAST THEY FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL FOR WHICH THE DAWNCHILD WEPT
AS TO THE GREAT SERVICE SAID CARTON
AND INZANA LOOKING UP FOUND THAT HER BALL WAS LOST AND ALL ALONE IN THE STILLNESS ONE OWL LAUGHED WHEN THE GODS HEARD INZANA CRYING FOR HER BALL THEY CLUSTERED TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD AND PEERED INTO THE DARK BUT SAW NO GOLDEN BALL
AND INZANA SAW A JEWELLED CASKET INTO WHICH HER PLAYTHING FELL BUT WHEN SHE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP AGAIN SHE FOUND NO JEWELLED CASKET WITH RUBIES SILVER OR SAPPHIRES BUT ONLY WICKED MOUNTAINS DISGUISED IN SNOW THAT HAD TRAPPED HER GOLDEN BALL
AND MIGHTILY DIVED FROM THE LAST CHALCEDONY STEP
AND UP THE VALLEYS SHALL GO UMBORODOM
BUT THE BLACK MOUNTAINS DISGUISED THEMSELVES WITH SNOW AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL FELL DOWN TOWARDS THEM THEY TURNED THEIR PEAKS TO RUBY CRIMSON AND THEIR LAKES TO SAPPHIRES GLEAMING AMONGST SILVER
AND IN THE DARKNESS UNDERNEATH THE WORLD HE MET THE THREE GREY TRAVELLERS AND RUSHED UPON THEM AND DROVE THEM FAR BEFORE HIM SMITING THEM WITH HIS SWORD TILL THEIR GREY CLOAKS STREAMED WITH BLOOD AND OUT OF THE MIDST OF THEM
GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
AND THERE WERE ONLY THE EYES OF THE GODS IN THE DARKNESS PEERING FOR THE GOLDEN BALL THEN SAID THE GODS THOU HAST LOST THY GOLDEN BALL AND THEY MADE HER A MOON OF SILVER TO ROLL ABOUT THE SKY
AND THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED FREE PASSING UNDER THE SHATTERED EARTH AND SO ROLLED BACK TO PEGANA AND LIMPANG TUNG CAME HOME TO THE ONYX STEP AND TOOK THE DAWNCHILD BY THE HAND AND TOLD NOT WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE
A HERON HAD SEEN IT LYING IN A POND BUT A WILD DUCK IN SOME REEDS HAD SEEN IT LAST AS SHE CAME HOME ACROSS THE HILLS AND THEN IT WAS ROLLING VERY FAR AWAY AT LAST THE COCK CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT LYING BENEATH THE WORLD
THEN FROM TINTAGGON'S MARBLE FRONT THE SEA FELL BACKWARDS CRYING ON TO A BROKEN SHORE AND RIPPLE BY RIPPLE STRAGGLED BACK TO SLID SAYING TINTAGGON STANDS
BUT I THINK I KNOW HE DOES IF YOU KNOW IT IT IS ENOUGH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO MY LIFE
I REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN YOU FORCED ME TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAD BEEN DRINKING I REMEMBER IT TOO THE CURSE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IS HEAVY UPON ME FOR I ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM I HOPE IT MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONE DAY WHEN ALL DAYS ARE AT AN END FOR ME
AND FELL TOWARDS THE FIELDS AND AS INZANA STOOPED TO PICK IT UP SHE SUDDENLY HEARD THE SINGING OF ALL THE BIRDS THAT WERE
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
THE GOLDEN BALL WENT BOUNDING UP THE SKY AND THE DAWNCHILD WITH HER FLARING HAIR STOOD LAUGHING UPON THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS AND IT WAS DAY SO GLEAMING FIELDS BELOW SAW THE FIRST OF ALL THE DAYS THAT THE GODS HAVE DESTINED
IF ONE FORLORN WANDERER THEN PACING THE DARK STREETS COULD HAVE HEARD HER INNOCENT DISCLOSURE AND COULD HAVE SEEN THE DROPS OF PITY KISSED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND FROM THE SOFT BLUE EYES SO LOVING OF THAT HUSBAND HE MIGHT HAVE CRIED TO THE NIGHT
SOMETIMES IN THEIR DREAMS THE WAR SCARRED WARRIORS OF SLID STILL LIFT THEIR HEADS AND CRY THEIR BATTLE CRY THEN DO DARK CLOUDS GATHER ABOUT TINTAGGON'S SWARTHY BROW AND HE STANDS OUT MENACING SEEN AFAR BY SHIPS WHERE ONCE HE CONQUERED SLID
AND WENT AWAY TO SIT AT THE FEET OF THE GODS BUT INZANA WENT AND PATTED THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE HEAD FOR SHE SAID IT WAS DARK AND LONELY IN THE SOUL OF THE EARTH THEREAFTER RETURNING STEP BY STEP CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX
ALL THE GODS MADE THEMSELVES STARS FOR TORCHES AND FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL THE SKY FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF NIGHT AS FAR AS HE PROWLED ABROAD AND AT ONE TIME SLID WITH THE PLEIADES IN HIS HAND CAME NIGH TO THE GOLDEN BALL
THEY HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME MANY HOURS WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS NOT IMPROVED IN HABITS OR IN LOOKS OR IN MANNER BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RUGGED AIR OF FIDELITY ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NEW TO THE OBSERVATION OF CHARLES DARNAY
HOW THE DEW HAS FALLEN AND HOW THE MISTS SET IN WITH BREEZES FROM THE STREAMS BUT THE DEW WAS THE TEARS OF THE DAWNCHILD AND THE MISTS WERE HER SIGHS
AND FAR AWAY TROGOOL UPON THE UTTER RIM TURNED A PAGE THAT WAS NUMBERED SIX IN A CIPHER THAT NONE MIGHT READ AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL WENT THROUGH THE SKY TO GLEAM ON LANDS AND CITIES THERE CAME THE FOG TOWARDS IT
THAT I MIGHT BE REGARDED AS AN USELESS AND I WOULD ADD IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE RESEMBLANCE I DETECTED BETWEEN YOU AND ME AN UNORNAMENTAL PIECE OF FURNITURE TOLERATED FOR ITS OLD SERVICE AND TAKEN NO NOTICE OF I DOUBT IF I SHOULD ABUSE THE PERMISSION
AND BADE THEM MARCH AGAINST SLID AND THE CLIFFS MARCHED DOWN TILL THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE SLID AND LEANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD AND FROWNED AND STOOD STAUNCH TO GUARD THE LANDS OF THE GODS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE SEA SHUTTING SLID OFF FROM THE WORLD
YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY SO AS A FASHION OF SPEECH BUT I DON'T MEAN ANY FASHION OF SPEECH INDEED WHEN I SAY I WISH WE MIGHT BE FRIENDS I SCARCELY MEAN QUITE THAT EITHER
STOOPING AS HE WALKED WITH HIS DARK BROWN CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND BEHIND HIM SLUNK THE NIGHT AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED PAST THE FOG SUDDENLY NIGHT SNARLED AND SPRANG UPON IT AND CARRIED IT AWAY HASTILY INZANA GATHERED THE GODS AND SAID
AND THEN SHE CRIED BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE TO FIND IT FOR THE THUNDER WAS FAR AWAY CHASING THE ECLIPSE AND ALL THE GODS LAMENTED WHEN THEY SAW HER SORROW
AND THE COCK AND ALL HIS TRIBE CRIED OUT WE FOUND IT WE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL AFAR LAUGHING WITH JOY TO SEE IT HER HANDS STRETCHED UPWARDS HER GOLDEN HAIR AFLOAT
WENT OUT TOWARDS THE WORLD TO FIND THE GOLDEN BALL BECAUSE INZANA WEPT AND INTO THE WORLD HE WENT TILL HE CAME TO THE NETHER CLIFFS THAT STAND BY THE INNER MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUL AND HEART OF THE EARTH WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE DWELLETH ALONE
AS THEY FLED WITH FLAPPING CLOAKS ALL RED AND GREY AND TATTERED HE LEAPT UP WITH THE GOLDEN BALL AND GAVE IT TO THE DAWNCHILD AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL INTO THE SKY MAKING THE THIRD DAY AND UP AND UP IT WENT
AND LEANING FORWARD THEY CRIED OUT TO THE BAT AS HE PASSED UP AND DOWN BAT THAT SEEST ALL THINGS WHERE IS THE GOLDEN BALL AND THOUGH THE BAT ANSWERED NONE HEARD AND NONE OF THE WINDS HAD SEEN IT NOR ANY OF THE BIRDS
UPON AN EVENING OF THE FORGOTTEN YEARS THE GODS WERE SEATED ON THE HILLS AND ALL THE LITTLE RIVERS OF THE WORLD LAY COILED AT THEIR FEET ASLEEP
IN THE NIGHT TIME TIP TOED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THE BALL GENTLY FOR HE WAS A GOD AWAY FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DAWNCHILD TO GLEAM ON AN ONYX STEP
BUT MISTER DARNAY OBLIVION IS NOT SO EASY TO ME AS YOU REPRESENT IT TO BE TO YOU I HAVE BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IT AND A LIGHT ANSWER DOES NOT HELP ME TO FORGET IT IF IT WAS A LIGHT ANSWER RETURNED DARNAY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR IT
WHAT IS THIS NEW CRY THAT THE GODS HAVE NEVER COMMANDED YET WHICH COMES TO THE EARS OF THE GODS
IT WAS DARK WHEN THE CHILD INZANA THE DAWN FIRST FOUND HER GOLDEN BALL THEN RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS WITH TRIPPING FEET CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX STEP BY STEP SHE CAST HER GOLDEN BALL ACROSS THE SKY
BUT I DO AND YOU MUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT WELL IF YOU COULD ENDURE TO HAVE SUCH A WORTHLESS FELLOW AND A FELLOW OF SUCH INDIFFERENT REPUTATION COMING AND GOING AT ODD TIMES I SHOULD ASK THAT I MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME AND GO AS A PRIVILEGED PERSON HERE
SAID CHARLES DARNAY QUITE ASTOUNDED THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE HIM ANY WRONG I NEVER THOUGHT THIS OF HIM MY HUSBAND IT IS SO I FEAR HE IS NOT TO BE RECLAIMED THERE IS SCARCELY A HOPE THAT ANYTHING IN HIS CHARACTER OR FORTUNES IS REPARABLE NOW
ALL IN A WORLD OF ROCKS UNDER THE RIM OF THE SKY AND SHE WANTED HER GOLDEN BALL AND COULD NOT LOVE THE DARK THEREAT UMBORODOM WHOSE HOUND WAS THE THUNDER TOOK HIS HOUND IN LEASH AND STRODE AWAY ACROSS THE SKY AFTER THE GOLDEN BALL
THERE WILL NO MORE COME A TIME WHEN I PLAY WITH MY BALL AGAIN FOR NOW IT IS LOST FOR EVER AND THE GODS TRIED TO COMFORT INZANA AS SHE PLAYED WITH HER SILVER MOON BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR THEM AND WENT IN TEARS TO SLID WHERE HE PLAYED WITH GLEAMING SAILS
I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
BUT SLID ADVANCED AND LED HIS ARMIES UP THE VALLEY AND INCH BY INCH AND MILE BY MILE HE CONQUERED THE LANDS OF THE GODS THEN FROM THEIR HILLS THE GODS SENT DOWN A GREAT ARRAY OF CLIFFS AGAINST HARD RED ROCKS
I WILL REMEMBER IT AS LONG AS I LIVE
AND THE GODS ON THEIR HILL TOPS HEARD ONCE MORE THE VOICE OF SLID EXULTING OVER THEIR CLIFFS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD LAY SUBJECT TO SLID AND STILL HIS ARMIES ADVANCED
TILL IT CAME TO ITS ZENITH AND DROPPED TOWARDS THE WORLD
SHALL KNOW THE NEW GOD SLID THEN SHALL MINE ARMIES STRIVE WITH THEE NO MORE AND THOU AND I SHALL BE THE EQUAL LORDS OF THE WHOLE EARTH WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SINGING THE CHAUNT OF SLID AND THY HEAD ALONE SHALL BE LIFTED ABOVE MINE ARMIES WHEN RIVAL HILLS ARE DEAD
THEN FAR BELOW ON THE WORLD A HUMAN CHILD CRIED OUT TO THE DAWNCHILD FOR THE GOLDEN BALL
THAT CARRIED AWAY BETWEEN THEM A GOLDEN BALL THEN UP LEAPT THE NORTH WIND HE WHO GUARDS THE POLE AND DREW HIS SWORD OF ICE OUT OF HIS SCABBARD OF SNOW AND SPED AWAY ALONG THE ROAD THAT LEADS ACROSS THE BLUE
THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
AND WENT TO BED AT EVENING AND PUT IT BENEATH HIS PILLOW AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NO ONE WORKED IN ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING AND THE LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL STREAMED UP FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND OUT THROUGH THE HALF SHUT DOOR AND SHONE IN THE WESTERN SKY
AND BIT THE EARTH BENEATH THEM AND HURLED THEIR CRAGS ABOUT AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH ROCKS AND FALLEN HILLS AND WENT BACK RAVENING AND GROWLING INTO THE SOUL OF THE EARTH AND THERE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
AND HALTED BEFORE SLID THEN SLID ADVANCED NO MORE AND LULLED HIS LEGIONS AND WHILE HIS WAVES WERE LOW HE SOFTLY CROONED A SONG SUCH AS ONCE LONG AGO HAD TROUBLED THE STARS AND BROUGHT DOWN TEARS OUT OF THE TWILIGHT
AND BEHIND SLID THERE MARCHED A MILLION WAVES ALL FOLLOWING SLID AND TRAMPING UP THE TWILIGHT AND SLID TOUCHED EARTH IN ONE OF HER GREAT GREEN VALLEYS THAT DIVIDE THE SOUTH AND HERE HE ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM
WHEN THE WORLDS AND ALL BEGAN THE GODS WERE STERN AND OLD AND THEY SAW THE BEGINNING FROM UNDER EYEBROWS HOAR WITH YEARS ALL BUT INZANA THEIR CHILD WHO PLAYED WITH THE GOLDEN BALL INZANA WAS THE CHILD OF ALL THE GODS
HE SUDDENLY LAUNCHED FIVE OCEANS OUT OF THE DEEP ALL TO ATTACK TINTAGGON AND THE FIVE OCEANS SPRANG UPON TINTAGGON AND PASSED ABOVE HIS HEAD ONE BY ONE THE GRIP OF THE OCEANS LOOSENED
BUT TO THE GODS AS THEY SAT UPON THEIR HILLTOPS A NEW CRY CAME CRYING OVER THE GREEN SPACES THAT LAY BELOW THE HILLS AND THE GODS SAID THIS IS NEITHER THE CRY OF LIFE NOR YET THE WHISPER OF DEATH
AND ALL THE GODS TOGETHER SEIZED THE BALL AND NIGHT TURNING SMOTE OUT THE TORCHES OF THE GODS AND THEREAFTER SLUNK AWAY AND ALL THE GODS IN TRIUMPH MARCHED UP THE GLEAMING STAIRWAY OF THE GODS
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF THERE DID THE THUNDER PUT HIS NOSE TO THE ROCKS AND BAY ALONG THE VALLEYS AND FAST AT HIS HEELS FOLLOWED UMBORODOM AND THE NEARER THE HOUND THE THUNDER CAME TO THE GOLDEN BALL THE LOUDER DID HE BAY
GENTLE THINGS EVEN MAGNANIMOUS THINGS SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PURITY OF HER FAITH IN THIS LOST MAN THAT HER HUSBAND COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WAS FOR HOURS AND O MY DEAREST LOVE SHE URGED
WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO PRESS ONE QUESTION ON ME IF I BEG YOU NOT TO ASK IT WILL I PROMISE WHAT WILL I NOT PROMISE TO MY LOVE WHAT INDEED WITH HIS HAND PUTTING ASIDE THE GOLDEN HAIR FROM THE CHEEK
AND GOING ACROSS THE GREEN EARTH CAME DOWN TO AMBRADY AT THE VALLEY'S EDGE AND THERE MET THE FOREMOST OF SLID'S FIERCE ARMIES CONQUERING THE WORLD AND AGAINST HIM SLID HURLED THE FORCE OF A WHOLE BAY WHICH LASHED ITSELF HIGH OVER TINTAGGON'S KNEES
AND SEIZED IT IN HIS JAWS WHEN INZANA SAW THE ECLIPSE BEARING HER PLAYTHING AWAY SHE CRIED ALOUD TO THE THUNDER WHO BURST FROM PEGANA AND FELL HOWLING UPON THE THROAT OF THE ECLIPSE WHO DROPPED THE GOLDEN BALL AND LET IT FALL TOWARDS EARTH
ONE MORNING AS SLID SANG OF OLD OUTRAGEOUS WARS
AND THERE FOUND SLID WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM THEN FOR A SPACE SLID AND THE FOUR WINDS STRUGGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER TILL THE STRENGTH OF THE WINDS WAS GONE AND THEY LIMPED BACK TO THE GODS THEIR MASTERS AND SAID WE HAVE MET THIS NEW THING
AND THE GODS WERE ANGRY WITH THEIR TRAITOROUS STREAMS THEN SLID CEASED FROM SINGING THE SONG THAT LURES THE WORLD AND GATHERED UP HIS LEGIONS
BUT NEVER FIND THE BALL AND MEN NO LONGER HAVING LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL SHALL PRAY TO THE GODS NO MORE WHO HAVING NO WORSHIP SHALL BE NO MORE THE GODS
INEQUALITIES OF THE ROAD ONLY QUICKENED ITS UTTERANCE OR DRAWLED IT TO AN EXASPERATING LENGTH IT WAS OF NO USE TO CONSIDER THE STATEMENT SERIOUSLY IT WAS OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO IT INDIGNANTLY
HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
I WENT TO A DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE AND LEARNED THAT SINCE DICTATING THE BIBLE AND HIRING A PERFECT RACE OF MINISTERS TO EXPLAIN IT GOD HAS NEVER DONE MUCH BUT CREEP AROUND AND TRY TO CATCH US DISOBEYING IT FROM COLLEGE I WENT TO NEW YORK TO THE COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL
FREQUENT AND FULL EXPECTORATION CONVINCED ME THAT HIS LIPS WERE AS YET NOT SEALED BY THE GAG OF HIGHWAYMEN AND SOOTHED MY ANXIOUS EAR
AND FOR FOUR YEARS I LIVED OH I WON'T RHAPSODIZE ABOUT NEW YORK IT WAS DIRTY AND NOISY AND BREATHLESS AND GHASTLY EXPENSIVE BUT COMPARED WITH THE MOLDY ACADEMY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN SMOTHERED I WENT TO SYMPHONIES TWICE A WEEK
FAUSTUS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED HIS AGONIZING PRAYER WHEN A SUDDEN SPASM OF ACTIVITY ATTACKED MY DRIVER A SUCCESSION OF WHIP SNAPPINGS LIKE A PACK OF CHINESE CRACKERS BROKE FROM THE BOX BEFORE ME THE STAGE LEAPED FORWARD
THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE AT LEAST WITH THE RULING CLASS THERE IS A RULING CLASS DESPITE ALL OUR PROFESSIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PENALTY WE TRIBAL RULERS PAY IS THAT OUR SUBJECTS WATCH US EVERY MINUTE
A NUMBER OF INFINITESIMAL ANNOYANCES WINDING UP WITH THE RESOLUTE PERSISTENCY OF THE CLERK AT THE STAGE OFFICE TO ENTER MY NAME MISSPELT ON THE WAYBILL HAD NOT PREDISPOSED ME TO CHEERFULNESS
OH WHAT IS THERE TO CONFIDE THE PEOPLE ARE SAVORLESS AND PROUD OF IT AND EVEN IF I LIKED YOU TREMENDOUSLY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOU WITHOUT TWENTY OLD HEXES WATCHING WHISPERING
CHECKING THE COMPLIMENT THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE RISEN UNBIDDEN TO MY LIPS AND HAVE BROUGHT SHAME AND SORROW TO THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS WITH THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RESTING HEAVILY UPON ME THAT I STOOD HESITATINGLY BEFORE THE STAGE DOOR
AND NONE OF THE INTRIGANTE'S JOY IN FURTIVENESS IF SHE WAS THE NAIVE GIRL GUY POLLOCK WAS THE CLUMSY BOY HE RACED ABOUT THE OFFICE HE RAMMED HIS FISTS INTO HIS POCKETS HE STAMMERED I I I OH THE DEVIL
YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN REFUSING TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS SUMMING UP I'M A TEDIOUS OLD FOOL ANALYZING THE OBVIOUS WHILE YOU'RE THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION TELL ME YOUR SIDE WHAT IS GOPHER PRAIRIE TO YOU A BORE
REMAINED FOR A MOMENT IN SERIOUS AND EXPECTORATIVE CONTEMPLATION OF THE BOOT AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS COLUMN THERE WAS SOMETHING SO WEIRD IN THIS BAPTISM THAT I GREW QUITE NERVOUS PERHAPS I WAS OUT OF SPIRITS
LET ME ASSURE THE READER THAT I HAVE NO ULTERIOR DESIGN IN MAKING THIS ASSERTION
IT WAS RETICENT AND UNSWERVING IN ITS UPRIGHT FIDELITY AND AT LAST SLIPPED LISTLESSLY THROUGH MY FINGERS I HAD DOZED REPEATEDLY WAKED ON THE THRESHOLD OF OBLIVION BY CONTACT WITH SOME OF THE ANGLES OF THE COACH
HAD BEGUN TO SEPARATE THE FORMLESS MASSES OF THE SHADOWY LANDSCAPE TREES ISOLATED IN CLUMPS AND ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED PLACES BEFORE MY WINDOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE DISTANT HILLS CAME BACK AS IN DAYLIGHT
HE GRINNED OH MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WILL HAS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF A CASE WHERE DOCTOR
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
AND I'VE NEVER THOUGHT TO CALL I'M HORRIBLY ASHAMED DO BRING THEM SHE STOPPED FOR NO VERY CLEAR REASON BUT HIS EXPRESSION SAID HER FALTERING ADMITTED THAT THEY WISHED THEY HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE DILLONS
IT HURTS ME IN YOU IT'S LIKE BLOOD ON THE WING OF A HUMMING BIRD I'M NOT A HUMMING BIRD I'M A HAWK A TINY LEASHED HAWK PECKED TO DEATH BY THESE LARGE WHITE FLABBY WORMY HENS BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR CONFIRMING ME IN THE FAITH
AND THE HIGHWAYMAN WITH BLACKENED FACE WHO DID THE THING SO QUIETLY DRIVING ME WHITHER THE THING IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE AND WHAT IS THIS FANCY NOW BEING JOLTED OUT OF ME A STORY IT'S OF NO USE TO KEEP IT BACK
A LONELY RIDE AS I STEPPED INTO THE SLUMGULLION STAGE I SAW THAT IT WAS A DARK NIGHT A LONELY ROAD
HE DROPPED INTO THE SHRIEKING DESK CHAIR HE LOOKED SQUARELY AT HER SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAN AND LONELY THEY WERE EMBARRASSED THEY ELABORATELY GLANCED AWAY AND WERE RELIEVED AS HE WENT ON
THE WIDOW ROBBING DEACON OF FICTION CAN'T HELP BEING HYPOCRITICAL THE WIDOWS THEMSELVES DEMAND IT THEY ADMIRE HIS UNCTUOUSNESS AND LOOK AT ME SUPPOSE I DID DARE TO MAKE LOVE TO SOME EXQUISITE MARRIED WOMAN I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT TO MYSELF
SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS GUY POLLOCK I'M AWFULLY SORRY MISSUS KENNICOTT BUT I DON'T KNOW WON'T YOU COME IN AND WAIT FOR THEM
CAN I HELP HOW COULD YOU I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BY LISTENING I HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT BUT NORMALLY CAN'T I BE THE CONFIDANT OF THE OLD FRENCH PLAYS THE TIRING MAID WITH THE MIRROR AND THE LOYAL EARS
TINKLED RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFIDENT AND UNCERTAIN TOUCH ON THE WHITE WALL THE SHADOW OF AN OLD AND SHARP PROFILE WAS BENDING OVER SEVERAL SYMMETRICAL AND SHADOWY CURLS I SEZ TO MARIAR MARIAR SEZ I
A LOUNGER ON THE STEPS OF THE HOTEL WHO I HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE WAS NOT IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE STAGE COMPANY GRAVELY DESCENDED AND WALKING TOWARD THE CONVEYANCE TRIED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR OPENED IT EXPECTORATED IN THE CARRIAGE
ALONG WITH GENERAL GRANT'S SWORD AND I'M OH I SUPPOSE I'M SEEKING FOR A GOSPEL THAT WILL EVANGELIZE GOPHER PRAIRIE REALLY EVANGELIZE IT TO WHAT TO ANYTHING THAT'S DEFINITE SERIOUSNESS OR FRIVOLOUSNESS OR BOTH
RESCUED BY THE ANGEL I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF WHO IS THE ASSUMED DAUGHTER OF THE BRIGAND BUT THE REAL DAUGHTER OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AGAIN IN THE VAIN HOPE OF DISTINGUISHING THE DRIVER
PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
WHEN I LEFT THE DINING ROOM WITH AN ODD FEELING THAT I HAD BEEN SUPPING EXCLUSIVELY ON MUSTARD AND TEA LEAVES I STOPPED A MOMENT AT THE PARLOR DOOR A PIANO HARMONIOUSLY RELATED TO THE DINNER BELL
WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
SHE SAT STILL AND MAUNDERED I KNOW THE VILLAGE VIRUS PERHAPS IT WILL GET ME SOME DAY I'M GOING OH NO MATTER AT LEAST I AM MAKING YOU TALK
SHE REMEMBERED CERTAIN REMARKS WHICH KENNICOTT HAD OFFERED REGARDING THE WIDOW BOGART SHE FLINCHED LOOKED AT GUY BESEECHINGLY HE SPRANG UP STRODE TO HER WITH A NERVOUS STEP SMOOTHED HER HAND
SO WE DID TWO HOURS AGO THAT'S ODD I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
LUNATICS HAD NOT YET REACHED SUCH DEPTH OF IMBECILITY AS TO RIDE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL IN CALIFORNIA STAGES AND MY LAURA AMIABLE AND LONG SUFFERING AS SHE ALWAYS IS COULD NOT I FEAR
I'M NOT SURE THAT I SHALL I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP MY OWN LARGE CAPACITY FOR DULLNESS AND CONTENTMENT I'VE FAILED AT EVERY POSITIVE THING I'VE TRIED I'D BETTER SETTLE DOWN AS THEY CALL IT AND BE SATISFIED TO BE NOTHING DON'T BE CYNICAL
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
HE STALKED TO HER TOOK HER UNRESPONSIVE HAND CAROL YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE TONIGHT YES I'M BEGGING SHE SQUEEZED HIS HAND QUICKLY THEN SNATCHED HERS AWAY SHE HAD BUT LITTLE OF THE CURIOSITY OF THE FLIRT
OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO THE MYSTERIOUS FEMALE TO PICTURE HER AS REARING A THIN BLOODED GENERATION ON SELFISH AND MECHANICALLY REPEATED AXIOMS ALL THIS FAILED TO COUNTERACT THE MONOTONOUS REPETITION OF THIS SENTENCE
GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
THEN I FOUND THAT THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ABSOLUTE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE NEW STREETS AND YOUNGER MEN REAL COMPETITION IT WAS TOO EASY TO GO ON MAKING OUT CONVEYANCES AND ARGUING DITCHING CASES SO
THE STORYTELLER WHO WILLFULLY TEMPTS FATE BY SUCH OBVIOUS BEGINNINGS WHO IS TO THE EXPECTANT READER IN DANGER OF BEING ROBBED OR HALF MURDERED OR FRIGHTENED BY AN ESCAPED LUNATIC OR INTRODUCED TO HIS LADYLOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVEN IN THE DARKNESS THE RED DUST OF WINGDAM WAS VISIBLE ON ITS ROOF AND SIDES AND THE RED SLIME OF SLUMGULLION CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO ITS WHEELS I OPENED THE DOOR THE STAGE CREAKED EASILY
IT HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY UNREAL AND THEATRICAL EFFECT IT WAS THE FULL MOON OF NORMA THAT REMARKABLE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON WHICH RISES SO PALPABLY TO A HUSHED AUDIENCE AND A SUBLIME ANDANTE CHORUS UNTIL THE CASTA DIVA IS SUNG
DESERVES TO BE DETECTED I AM RELIEVED TO SAY THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED TO ME THE ROAD FROM WINGDAM TO SLUMGULLION KNEW NO OTHER BANDITTI THAN THE REGULARLY LICENSED HOTELKEEPERS
I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
BUT I WOULDN'T TELL HER MY HEART'S SECRETS IF I WERE YOU MY DEAR I INSIST THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PROFESSIONAL MAN'S WIFE IN THIS TOWN WHO DOESN'T PLOT AND THAT IS YOU YOU BLESSED CREDULOUS OUTSIDER I WON'T BE CAJOLED
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
THAT THEY WERE IN HOLES AND SMUDGED TO GRAYNESS THERE WERE ONLY TWO THINGS WHICH SUGGESTED GUY POLLOCK ON THE GREEN FELT OF THE TABLE DESK BETWEEN LEGAL BLANKS AND A CLOTTED INKWELL
FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
THE INCONSTANT MOON THAT THEN AND THEREAFTER REMAINS FIXED IN THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IT WERE A PART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM INAUGURATED BY JOSHUA AGAIN THE WHITE ROBED DRUIDS FILED PAST ME
MOST TROUBLES ARE UNNECESSARY WE HAVE NATURE BEATEN WE CAN MAKE HER GROW WHEAT WE CAN KEEP WARM WHEN SHE SENDS BLIZZARDS SO WE RAISE THE DEVIL JUST FOR PLEASURE WARS POLITICS RACE HATREDS LABOR DISPUTES
WITH SPURIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE SAID SPLENDID I WILL FROM THE DOOR HE GLANCED AT HER CURLED IN THE PEELED LEATHER CHAIR HE SLIPPED OUT CAME BACK WITH DOCTOR AND MISSUS DILLON
PARBLEU DRAW MY RAPIER AND DIE VALOROUSLY I AM FOUND A WEEK OR TWO AFTER OUTSIDE A DESERTED CABARET NEAR THE BARRIER WITH A HOLE THROUGH MY RUFFLED LINEN AND MY POCKETS STRIPPED NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I AM RESCUED
BUT ALSO IN SKATING I'LL SKATE WITH THEM OR SLIDE OR THROW SNOWBALLS JUST AS GLADLY AS TALK WITH YOU OH NO YES BUT THEY WANT TO STAY HOME AND EMBROIDER PERHAPS I'M NOT DEFENDING THE TOWN
THAT'S ALL OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A LIVING DEAD MAN EXCEPT THE DIVERTING LAST CHAPTER THE LIES ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN A TOWER OF STRENGTH AND LEGAL WISDOM WHICH SOME DAY A PREACHER WILL SPIN OVER MY LEAN DRY BODY
I WON'T BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE THE PRIESTHOOD OF HEALING CAN BE TURNED INTO A PENNY PICKING BUSINESS SEE HERE HASN'T KENNICOTT EVER HINTED TO YOU THAT YOU'D BETTER BE NICE TO SOME OLD WOMAN BECAUSE SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS WHICH DOCTOR TO CALL IN BUT I OUGHTN'T TO
YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SHALL PLEASE TRY THIS CHAIR SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE RUSTY OFFICE GAUNT STOVE SHELVES OF TAN LAW BOOKS DESK CHAIR FILLED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO LONG SAT UPON
HAVE BORNE UP AGAINST THESE DEPRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION ON ME I STOOD WITH MY SHAWL AND CARPETBAG IN HAND GAZING DOUBTINGLY ON THE VEHICLE
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
I FEEL LIKE A CHILD YET I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER SO IT'S DECENTLY PATERNAL TO IMAGINE YOU CURLED AT MY FEET OF COURSE I HOPE IT ISN'T BUT WE'LL REFLECT THE MORALS OF GOPHER PRAIRIE BY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING THAT IT IS THESE STANDARDS THAT YOU AND I LIVE UP TO
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS TABLE DESK FINGERING THE STARRY ENAMELED VASE SHE COULD NOT COMMENT SHE PICTURED HERSELF RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM TO PAT HIS HAIR SHE SAW THAT HIS LIPS WERE FIRM UNDER HIS SOFT FADED MUSTACHE
WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF SOME OTHER ANNOYANCE THAT HAD BEEN FORCING ITSELF UPON ME FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HOW QUIET THE DRIVER WAS WAS THERE ANY DRIVER HAD I ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT LYING GAGGED AND BOUND ON THE ROADSIDE
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED
I WOULDN'T CARE WHETHER IT WAS A LABORATORY OR A CARNIVAL BUT IT'S MERELY SAFE TELL ME MISTER POLLOCK WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT ISN'T THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH YOU AND ME
ON A SWING SHELF WAS A ROW OF BOOKS UNFAMILIAR TO GOPHER PRAIRIE MOSHER EDITIONS OF THE POETS BLACK AND RED GERMAN NOVELS A CHARLES LAMB IN CRUSHED LEVANT GUY DID NOT SIT DOWN HE QUARTERED THE OFFICE
THE INMATES OF THE EUREKA HOUSE FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE THERE WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION SO COMMON TO MANY HONEST PEOPLE THAT A SERIOUS STYLE OF DEPORTMENT AND CONDUCT TOWARD A STRANGER INDICATES HIGH GENTILITY AND ELEVATED STATION
SHE OBSERVED AS SHE REFLECTED THAT IN GOPHER PRAIRIE IT IS NOT DECENT TO CALL ON A MAN AS SHE DECIDED THAT NO REALLY SHE WOULDN'T GO IN AND AS SHE WENT IN I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR OFFICE WAS UP HERE
IT IS SO DARK THAT WHEN I ALIGHT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF THE FOOTMAN WHO HOLDS THE CARRIAGE DOOR BUT WHAT OF THAT PESTE I AM HEAVY WITH SLEEP THE SAME OBSCURITY ALSO HIDES THE OLD FAMILIAR INDECENCIES OF THE STATUES ON THE TERRACE
HERE A STRANGER IS TAKEN IN IF HE IS CORRECT IF HE LIKES HUNTING AND MOTORING AND GOD AND OUR SENATOR THERE WE DIDN'T TAKE IN EVEN OUR OWN TILL WE HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY GOT USED TO THEM
A MARQUIS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC READER DELIGHTS IN THE NOBILITY MY NAME IS SOMETHING LIGNY
AND WHEN I COULD PICK MYSELF FROM UNDER THE SEAT A LONG WHITE BUILDING HAD IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY ROLLED BEFORE MY WINDOW IT MUST BE SLUMGULLION AS I DESCENDED FROM THE STAGE I ADDRESSED THE DRIVER I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED HORSES ON THE ROAD
OBEYING THIS PRINCIPLE ALL HILARITY CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE TO SUPPER AND GENERAL REMARK MERGED INTO THE SAFER AND UNCOMPROMISING CHRONICLE OF SEVERAL BAD CASES OF DIPHTHERIA THEN EPIDEMIC AT WINGDAM
LET THE OLD MAN RAVE HOW OLD ARE YOU CAROL TWENTY SIX GUY TWENTY SIX I WAS JUST LEAVING NEW YORK AT TWENTY SIX I HEARD PATTI SING AT TWENTY SIX AND NOW I'M FORTY SEVEN
ACROSS IT HE PEERED AT HER WITH SUCH LONELINESS THAT SHE WAS STARTLED BUT HIS EYES FADED INTO IMPERSONALITY AS HE TALKED OF THE JEALOUSIES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE HE STOPPED HIMSELF WITH A SHARP GOOD LORD CAROL YOU'RE NOT A JURY
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A PATENT LAWYER FROM CHICAGO AND I REALIZED THAT I'D ALWAYS FELT SO SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE LIKE JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH BUT I SAW THAT I WAS AS PROVINCIAL AND BEHIND THE TIMES AS JULIUS WORSE
MAY I JOIN YOU IN THE HONOR OF HAVING SOMETHING THE MATTER YES THANKS NO I THINK IT'S THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SKATING MORE THAN BIOLOGY BUT I'M NOT ONLY MORE INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY THAN THE JOLLY SEVENTEEN
WHOSE RUMINATING REPOSE UPON THE HIGHWAY WE HAD RUTHLESSLY DISTURBED BUT IN THE DARKNESS OUR PROGRESS MORE THE GUIDANCE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT THAN ANY APPARENT VOLITION OF OUR OWN GAVE AN INDEFINABLE CHARM OF SECURITY TO OUR JOURNEY
THE WORST IS THE COMMERCIAL HATRED THE GROCER FEELING THAT ANY MAN WHO DOESN'T DEAL WITH HIM IS ROBBING HIM WHAT HURTS ME IS THAT IT APPLIES TO LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND DECIDEDLY TO THEIR WIVES AS MUCH AS TO GROCERS THE DOCTORS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
AND IN THE GLOOMY ABYSS THE SWAYING STRAPS BECKONED ME LIKE GHOSTLY HANDS TO COME IN NOW AND HAVE MY SUFFERINGS OUT AT ONCE I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THE OCCURRENCE OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH STRUCK ME AS APPALLING AND MYSTERIOUS
I TRIED TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MARIAR'S I TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT CONFINING THE SYMMETRICAL CURLS OF THAT GIRL IT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE SOFT COMPLIMENTS WHISPERED IN HER EARS WHICH PROVOKED THE WRATH OF THE AGED FEMALE BUT IN VAIN
AGAIN I SAW THAT IMPROBABLE MISTLETOE CUT FROM THAT IMPOSSIBLE OAK AND AGAIN COLD CHILLS RAN DOWN MY BACK WITH THE FIRST STRAIN OF THE RECITATIVE
THE FOUR OF THEM DRANK RATHER BAD COFFEE WHICH POLLOCK MADE ON A KEROSENE BURNER THEY LAUGHED AND SPOKE OF MINNEAPOLIS AND WERE TREMENDOUSLY TACTFUL
AND FEELING THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ASSUMING IN IMITATION OF A HUMBLE INSECT OF MY CHILDISH RECOLLECTION THAT SPHERICAL SHAPE WHICH COULD BEST RESIST THOSE IMPRESSIONS WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE MOON RIDING HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
THAT A MOMENT'S HESITATION OR INDECISION ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE DESTROYED I HAD INDULGED A HOPE THAT IN THE EMPTY VEHICLE I MIGHT OBTAIN THAT REST SO OFTEN DENIED ME IN ITS CROWDED CONDITION IT WAS A WEAK DELUSION
HOW YOUR HUSBAND AND WESTLAKE AND GOULD DISLIKE ONE ANOTHER
HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ME I LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE BOX SEAT BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE APPEAL I FLUNG MY CARPETBAG INTO THE CHASM DIVED RECKLESSLY AFTER IT AND BEFORE I WAS FAIRLY SEATED
WHEN I STRETCHED OUT MY LIMBS IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES FOR MAKING SEVERAL PEOPLE DISTINCTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MY INDIVIDUAL FRAME AT LAST RESTING MY ARMS ON THE STRAPS
BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED THE SMELL OF PATCHOULI OR OF FACTORY SMOKE ARE JUST AS SUSPICIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS I WONDER IF THE SMALL TOWN ISN'T WITH SOME LOVELY EXCEPTIONS A SOCIAL APPENDIX SOME DAY THESE DULL MARKET TOWNS MAY BE AS OBSOLETE AS MONASTERIES
WE CAN'T GET WHOLESOMELY DRUNK AND RELAX WE HAVE TO BE SO CORRECT ABOUT SEX MORALS AND INCONSPICUOUS CLOTHES AND DOING OUR COMMERCIAL TRICKERY ONLY IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE UP TO IT AND WE BECOME HORRIBLY HYPOCRITICAL UNAVOIDABLY
BUT THERE IS A DOOR AND IT OPENS AND SHUTS BEHIND ME SMARTLY THEN I FIND MYSELF IN A TRAP IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BRIGAND WHO HAS QUIETLY GAGGED POOR ANDRE AND CONDUCTED THE CARRIAGE THITHER THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO AS A GALLANT FRENCH MARQUIS BUT TO SAY
IT'S MERELY I'M A CONFIRMED DOUBTER OF MYSELF PROBABLY I'M CONCEITED ABOUT MY LACK OF CONCEIT ANYWAY GOPHER PRAIRIE ISN'T PARTICULARLY BAD IT'S LIKE ALL VILLAGES IN ALL COUNTRIES MOST PLACES THAT HAVE LOST THE SMELL OF EARTH
MY FEARS FOR THE DRIVER WERE DISSIPATED WITH THE RISING MOON A FAMILIAR SOUND HAD ASSURED ME OF HIS PRESENCE IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE IN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT IT WEAKLY AS WE TOO OFTEN TREAT OTHER ILLUSIONS OF DARKNESS AND NECESSITY FOR THE TIME BEING
PARTICULARLY IN THIS ABYSMAL VEHICLE AND HERE IT COMES I AM A MARQUIS A FRENCH MARQUIS FRENCH BECAUSE THE PEERAGE IS NOT SO WELL KNOWN
I PICKED IT UP WITH AN INTEREST THAT HOWEVER SOON ABATED THERE WAS NO SCENT OF THE ROSES TO CLING TO IT STILL NOT EVEN OF HAIR OIL NO BEND OR TWIST IN ITS RIGID ANGLES BETRAYED ANY TRAIT OF ITS WEARER'S CHARACTER
MISSUS MC GANUM AND I HAVEN'T ANY PARTICULAR CRUSH ON EACH OTHER SHE'S SO STOLID BUT HER MOTHER MISSUS WESTLAKE NOBODY COULD BE SWEETER YES I'M SURE SHE'S VERY BLAND
I KNEW THEM ONLY BY THE PECULIAR SODDEN ODOR THAT FROM TIME TO TIME SLUGGISHLY FLOWED IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW AS WE ROLLED BY WE PROCEEDED SLOWLY SO LEISURELY THAT LEANING FROM THE CARRIAGE I MORE THAN ONCE DETECTED THE FRAGRANT SIGH OF SOME ASTONISHED COW
I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
THE DIAGNOSIS OF MY VILLAGE VIRUS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH I WAS BORN IN AN OHIO TOWN ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE AND MUCH LESS FRIENDLY IT'D HAD MORE GENERATIONS IN WHICH TO FORM AN OLIGARCHY OF RESPECTABILITY
CHAMP IS THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM JOINING YOU IN SYMBOLIC DANCING OR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DIESEL ENGINE NO HE'S A DEAR SOUL BLESS HIM BUT HE BELONGS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
IT IS A DARK NIGHT AND I FALL ASLEEP AND TELL MY HONEST COACHMAN ANDRE NOT TO DISTURB ME AND DREAM OF AN ANGEL THE CARRIAGE AT LAST STOPS AT THE CHATEAU
WHERE ONE OF THE OTHERS HAS CONTINUED TO CALL ON PATIENTS LONGER THAN NECESSARY HE HAS LAUGHED ABOUT IT BUT HE STILL GRINNED NO REALLY AND WHEN YOU SAY THE WIVES OF THE DOCTORS SHARE THESE JEALOUSIES
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
IT WAS OF NO USE TO RECALL THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE PRAISE TO THE FACE HAD REDOUNDED TO THE EVERLASTING HONOR OF PRAISER AND BEPRAISED OF NO USE TO DWELL SENTIMENTALLY ON MODEST GENIUS AND COURAGE LIFTED UP AND STRENGTHENED BY OPEN COMMENDATION
EXPECTORATED CAREFULLY ON THE AXLE AND RETURNED SLOWLY AND PENSIVELY TO THE HOTEL A THIRD SPECTATOR WEARILY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM ONE OF THE IONIC COLUMNS OF THE PORTICO AND WALKED TO THE BOX
WHEN I GET HOLD OF ONE IN CHICAGO YET I SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO HOLD YOUR HAND I'M BROKEN IT'S THE HISTORICAL ANGLO SAXON WAY OF MAKING LIFE MISERABLE
AND THE NIGHT AND ITS SHADOWS MOVED SOLEMNLY UPON US TO SAY IT WAS DARK EXPRESSED BUT FAINTLY THE PITCHY OBSCURITY THAT ENCOMPASSED THE VEHICLE THE ROADSIDE TREES WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AS DEEPER MASSES OF SHADOW
BY DINT OF MUCH GYMNASTIC EFFORT I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO BE AWARE OF A MORE REFINED SPECIES OF TORTURE THE SPRINGS OF THE STAGE RISING AND FALLING REGULARLY PRODUCED A RHYTHMICAL BEAT WHICH BEGAN TO ABSORB MY ATTENTION PAINFULLY
AND CARRIED AN UMBRELLA HIS HAT TILTED BACK UNCOVERED A GOOD DEAL OF FOREHEAD WHICH APPEARED VERY WHITE IN THE DUSK IN THE DARK PATCHES OF THE ORBITS THE EYEBALLS GLIMMERED PIERCINGLY LONG DROOPING MOUSTACHES
THE FACT OF THE OUTRAGE BEING ATTEMPTED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HE HAD ASSURED A HIGH OFFICIAL THAT NO OUTBREAK OF ANARCHIST ACTIVITY WAS TO BE APPREHENDED WAS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING IF HE EVER THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE IN MAKING A STATEMENT IT WAS THEN
IT MAY YET BE NECESSARY TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF YOU OUGHT TO BE SHOT AT SIGHT LIKE MAD DOGS THEN THAT WILL BE THE GAME
I SHOULD THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE EASILY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT WOULD BE PRINTED BUT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING BURIED TOGETHER WITH ME
AFFECTED HIS FEELINGS WITH A SENSE OF RUTHLESS CRUELTY THOUGH HIS REASON TOLD HIM THE EFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN AS SWIFT AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE MAN WHOEVER HE WAS HAD DIED INSTANTANEOUSLY
BUT IN WHAT MAY BE BRIEFLY DEFINED IN ITS OWN SPECIAL PHRASEOLOGY AS SEVEN YEARS HARD CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS OF COURSE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE GRAVITY OF MORAL DIFFERENCES
THE PROFESSOR DID NOT STIR AN INCH THE BLENDED NOISES OF THE ENORMOUS TOWN SANK DOWN TO AN INARTICULATE LOW MURMUR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT CHANGED HIS TONE
IT HAD THAT QUALITY OF SERIOUSNESS BELONGING TO EVERY FORM OF OPEN SPORT
EXPOSING HIMSELF THEREBY TO THE UNANSWERABLE RETORT OF A FINGER TIP LAID FORCIBLY ON THE TELEGRAM WHICH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AFTER READING IT ALOUD HAD FLUNG ON THE DESK TO BE CRUSHED AS IT WERE UNDER THE TIP OF A FOREFINGER
THE STUNTED WEAKLY FIGURE BEFORE HIM SPOKE AT LAST I'VE NO DOUBT THE PAPERS WOULD GIVE YOU AN OBITUARY NOTICE THEN YOU KNOW BEST WHAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH TO YOU
HALF CONCEALING WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCUMULATION OF RAW MATERIAL FOR A CANNIBAL FEAST IT REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE FIRMNESS OF MIND NOT TO RECOIL BEFORE THAT SIGHT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT AN EFFICIENT OFFICER OF HIS DEPARTMENT
CHECKED HIS SWINGING PACE SUDDENLY HALLO HE SAID AND STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE WATCHFULLY THE PROFESSOR HAD ALREADY STOPPED WITH A READY HALF TURN WHICH BROUGHT HIS SHOULDERS VERY NEAR THE OTHER WALL
HAD SET BEFORE HIM A GOAL OF POWER AND PRESTIGE TO BE ATTAINED WITHOUT THE MEDIUM OF ARTS GRACES TACT WEALTH BY SHEER WEIGHT OF MERIT ALONE ON THAT VIEW HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ENTITLED TO UNDISPUTED SUCCESS HIS FATHER
I DON'T THINK I MISSED A SINGLE PIECE AS BIG AS A POSTAGE STAMP AT THIS POINT THE TRAINED FACULTIES OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR CEASED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CONSTABLE HE MOVED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS FOR BETTER LIGHT
LET HIM RUN ON THE HOSPITAL PORTER AND ANOTHER MAN TURNED DOWN THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND STEPPED ASIDE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S EYES SEARCHED THE GRUESOME DETAIL OF THAT HEAP OF MIXED THINGS
AND HE WAS A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW SHE NOTICED TWO MEN COMING OUT OF THE STATION AFTER THE UPTRAIN HAD GONE ON HE CONTINUED SLOWLY SHE COULDN'T TELL IF THEY WERE TOGETHER
THE THOUGHT THAT WHEN CALLED URGENTLY TO HIS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S PRIVATE ROOM HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS DISTINCTLY VEXING HIS INSTINCT OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN HAD TAUGHT HIM LONG AGO THAT AS A GENERAL RULE
ALL THE TIME HIS TRAINED FACULTIES OF AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATOR WHO SCORNS NO CHANCE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED THE SELF SATISFIED DISJOINTED LOQUACITY OF THE CONSTABLE
PRINCIPAL EXPERT IN ANARCHIST PROCEDURE THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHOSE RECOLLECTION DEPRESSED THE USUAL SERENITY OF THE EMINENT SPECIALIST THERE WAS ANOTHER DATING BACK ONLY TO THAT VERY MORNING
THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A BURGLAR ARE OF THE SAME KIND AS THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A POLICE OFFICER BOTH RECOGNISE THE SAME CONVENTIONS AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S METHODS AND OF THE ROUTINE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADES
THE HINT OF AN INVINCIBLE MULTITUDE BEHIND THAT MAN'S BACK ROUSED A SOMBRE INDIGNATION IN THE BREAST OF THE PROFESSOR HE SMILED NO LONGER HIS ENIGMATIC AND MOCKING SMILE
WAS OMINOUS FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE SUCH A MISERABLE OBJECT
HE WAS HUMAN BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS ALSO A MAN AND HE COULD NOT LET SUCH WORDS PASS ALL THIS IS GOOD TO FRIGHTEN CHILDREN WITH HE SAID I'LL HAVE YOU YET
SHELTERING THE ATROCIOUS INJUSTICE OF SOCIETY OF HUMBLE ORIGIN AND WITH AN APPEARANCE REALLY SO MEAN AS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS CONSIDERABLE NATURAL ABILITIES
KEEPING IN CHECK THIS MAN ARMED WITH THE DEFENSIVE MANDATE OF A MENACED SOCIETY MORE FORTUNATE THAN CALIGULA WHO WISHED THAT THE ROMAN SENATE HAD ONLY ONE HEAD FOR THE BETTER SATISFACTION OF HIS CRUEL LUST
WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS REPUTATION BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND HE ADMITTED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE ONE'S REPUTATION IF RANK OUTSIDERS WERE GOING TO TAKE A HAND IN THE BUSINESS OUTSIDERS ARE THE BANE OF THE POLICE AS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS
A DELICATE DARK ENTHUSIAST WITH A SLOPING FOREHEAD
AND TOOK UP THE LEAST SOILED OF THE RAGS IT WAS A NARROW STRIP OF VELVET WITH A LARGER TRIANGULAR PIECE OF DARK BLUE CLOTH HANGING FROM IT HE HELD IT UP TO HIS EYES AND THE POLICE CONSTABLE SPOKE VELVET COLLAR
NOT IN A HURRY TO GET HOME HE ASKED WITH MOCKING SIMPLICITY THE UNWHOLESOME LOOKING LITTLE MORAL AGENT OF DESTRUCTION EXULTED SILENTLY IN THE POSSESSION OF PERSONAL PRESTIGE
CHAPTER FIVE THE PROFESSOR HAD TURNED INTO A STREET TO THE LEFT AND WALKED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD CARRIED RIGIDLY ERECT IN A CROWD WHOSE EVERY INDIVIDUAL ALMOST OVERTOPPED HIS STUNTED STATURE
SAID CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT FIRMLY IF I WERE TO LAY MY HANDS ON YOU NOW I WOULD BE NO BETTER THAN YOURSELF AH THE GAME
A DEPARTMENT IS TO THOSE IT EMPLOYS A COMPLEX PERSONALITY WITH IDEAS AND EVEN FADS OF ITS OWN IT DEPENDS ON THE LOYAL DEVOTION OF ITS SERVANTS
HIS IMAGINATION HAD BEEN FIRED EARLY BY THE TALES OF MEN RISING FROM THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY TO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY AND AFFLUENCE THE EXTREME ALMOST ASCETIC PURITY OF HIS THOUGHT COMBINED WITH AN ASTOUNDING IGNORANCE OF WORLDLY CONDITIONS
STOOD HIS GROUND BUT FOR A WHOLE MINUTE HE DID NOT ADVANCE A LOCAL CONSTABLE IN UNIFORM CAST A SIDELONG GLANCE AND SAID
BUT WITH A SERIOUSNESS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THE MIND OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS INACCESSIBLE TO IDEAS OF REVOLT BUT HIS THIEVES WERE NOT REBELS HIS BODILY VIGOUR HIS COOL INFLEXIBLE MANNER
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF UNIVERSAL SUPPORT IN HIS GENERAL ACTIVITY HEARTENED HIM TO GRAPPLE WITH THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WAS THAT OF MANAGING THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF HIS DEPARTMENT HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR
OF THE WHOLE PAST LIFE LIVED WITH FRIGHTFUL INTENSITY BY A DROWNING MAN AS HIS DOOMED HEAD BOBS UP STREAMING FOR THE LAST TIME THE INEXPLICABLE MYSTERIES OF CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE BESET CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
STEPPED OUT WITH THE PURPOSEFUL BRISKNESS OF A MAN DISREGARDING INDEED THE INCLEMENCIES OF THE WEATHER BUT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING AN AUTHORISED MISSION ON THIS EARTH AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF HIS KIND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE IMMENSE TOWN
NOT WANTED I TELL YOU HE REPEATED THE ANARCHIST DID NOT STIR AN INWARD LAUGH OF DERISION UNCOVERED NOT ONLY HIS TEETH BUT HIS GUMS AS WELL
WAS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE VERY DAMAGING TOO FURTHERMORE CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS CONSCIOUS OF NOT HAVING MENDED MATTERS BY ALLOWING HIMSELF TO EXPRESS A CONVICTION
HE WALKED WITH THE NERVELESS GAIT OF A TRAMP GOING ON STILL GOING ON INDIFFERENT TO RAIN OR SUN IN A SINISTER DETACHMENT FROM THE ASPECTS OF SKY AND EARTH CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ON THE OTHER HAND AFTER WATCHING HIM FOR A WHILE
WHAT IF NOTHING COULD MOVE THEM SUCH MOMENTS COME TO ALL MEN
PERVERSE INDEED BUT STILL AN INDUSTRY EXERCISED IN AN INDUSTRIOUS WORLD
IT CAN NEVER BE PERFECTLY INFORMED IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR ITS EFFICIENCY TO KNOW TOO MUCH CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT GOT OUT OF THE TRAIN IN A STATE OF THOUGHTFULNESS ENTIRELY UNTAINTED WITH DISLOYALTY
AUTHORITIES FREE FROM ALL TAINT OF HATE AND DESPAIR AFTER PAYING THIS TRIBUTE TO WHAT IS NORMAL IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY
HIS RIGHT HAND FELL LIGHTLY ON THE BACK OF THE OUTCAST COUCH THE LEFT REMAINED PURPOSEFULLY PLUNGED DEEP IN THE TROUSERS POCKET AND THE ROUNDNESS OF THE HEAVY RIMMED SPECTACLES IMPARTED AN OWLISH CHARACTER TO HIS MOODY UNPERTURBED FACE
FACING THE ONLY GAS LAMP YAWNED THE CAVERN OF A SECOND HAND FURNITURE DEALER WHERE DEEP IN THE GLOOM OF A SORT OF NARROW AVENUE WINDING THROUGH A BIZARRE FOREST OF WARDROBES WITH AN UNDERGROWTH TANGLE OF TABLE LEGS
TILL HE EVOLVED A HORRIBLE NOTION THAT AGES OF ATROCIOUS PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE COULD BE CONTAINED BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE WINKS OF AN EYE AND MEANTIME THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WENT ON PEERING AT THE TABLE WITH A CALM FACE
HE HAD SWALLOWED A GOOD DEAL OF RAW UNWHOLESOME FOG IN THE PARK THEN HE HAD WALKED OVER TO THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IN GREENWICH WAS CONCLUDED AT LAST HE HAD LOST HIS INCLINATION FOR FOOD NOT ACCUSTOMED
TRUTH TO SAY CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT THOUGHT BUT LITTLE OF ANARCHISM HE DID NOT ATTACH UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO IT AND COULD NEVER BRING HIMSELF TO CONSIDER IT SERIOUSLY IT HAD MORE THE CHARACTER OF DISORDERLY CONDUCT
DISGUISED INTO CREEDS THE PROFESSOR'S INDIGNATION FOUND IN ITSELF A FINAL CAUSE THAT ABSOLVED HIM FROM THE SIN OF TURNING TO DESTRUCTION AS THE AGENT OF HIS AMBITION
AND SPEAKING WITH A WEAK SELF CONFIDENT VOICE TO THE VIGOROUS TENACIOUS VITALITY OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR THE PHYSICAL WRETCHEDNESS OF THAT BEING
A CONVENIENT TRAIN WHIRLED HIM UP TO TOWN ALONE AND PONDERING DEEPLY IN A THIRD CLASS COMPARTMENT
AND THESE CONDEMNED OLD HOUSES WOULD MAKE A GOOD HEAP OF BRICKS WHERE YOU STAND YOU'LL NEVER GET ME AT SO LITTLE COST TO LIFE AND PROPERTY WHICH YOU ARE PAID TO PROTECT
A MAN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT IN THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SON INDIVIDUALIST BY TEMPERAMENT ONCE THE SCIENCE OF COLLEGES HAD REPLACED THOROUGHLY THE FAITH OF CONVENTICLES
HE WAS IN A LONG STRAIGHT STREET PEOPLED BY A MERE FRACTION OF AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE
BUT NOT SO KINDLY AS IF HE WERE CONDESCENDING TO GIVE GOOD ADVICE TO A CRACKSMAN OF REPUTE GIVE IT UP YOU'LL FIND WE ARE TOO MANY FOR YOU THE FIXED SMILE ON THE PROFESSOR'S LIPS WAVERED
EXCEPT BY SOME FORM OF COLLECTIVE OR INDIVIDUAL VIOLENCE WAS PRECISE AND CORRECT HE WAS A MORAL AGENT THAT WAS SETTLED IN HIS MIND BY EXERCISING HIS AGENCY WITH RUTHLESS DEFIANCE
WE KNOW WHAT EACH OF THEM IS DOING HOUR BY HOUR HE HAD DECLARED AND THE HIGH OFFICIAL HAD DEIGNED TO SMILE THIS WAS SO OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO SAY FOR AN OFFICER OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT'S REPUTATION
THE MURMUR OF TOWN LIFE THE SUBDUED RUMBLE OF WHEELS IN THE TWO INVISIBLE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT CAME THROUGH THE CURVE OF THE SORDID LANE TO HIS EARS WITH A PRECIOUS FAMILIARITY AND AN APPEALING SWEETNESS
BUT STILL NAUSEATED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE PROFESSOR UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE FOR IRASCIBILITY IN A SOUND NORMAL MAN
AS IF THE MOCKING SPIRIT WITHIN HAD LOST ITS ASSURANCE CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WENT ON DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME EH WELL YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO LOOK ABOUT YOU WE ARE AND ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT DOING IT WELL
THE TONE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REMARKS HAD BEEN SOUR ENOUGH TO SET ONE'S TEETH ON EDGE AND SINCE BREAKFAST CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD NOT MANAGED TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT STARTING IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SPOT
AND RECALLING THE PROFESSOR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITHOUT CHECKING HIS SWINGING PACE MUTTERED THROUGH HIS TEETH LUNATIC CATCHING THIEVES WAS ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
AND THE DEVOTED LOYALTY OF TRUSTED SERVANTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AFFECTIONATE CONTEMPT WHICH KEEPS IT SWEET AS IT WERE BY A BENEVOLENT PROVISION OF NATURE NO MAN IS A HERO TO HIS VALET
TO DESTROY PUBLIC FAITH IN LEGALITY WAS THE IMPERFECT FORMULA OF HIS PEDANTIC FANATICISM BUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS CONVICTION THAT THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESTABLISHED SOCIAL ORDER CANNOT BE EFFECTUALLY SHATTERED
MORE OR LESS DEPLORABLE DOES HAPPEN BUT THE HIGH OFFICIAL CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS
WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE PANGS OF INCONCEIVABLE AGONY NO PHYSIOLOGIST AND STILL LESS OF A METAPHYSICIAN CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ROSE BY THE FORCE OF SYMPATHY WHICH IS A FORM OF FEAR ABOVE THE VULGAR CONCEPTION OF TIME
THOUGH I SUPPOSE YOUR FRIENDS WOULD MAKE AN EFFORT TO SORT US OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL HIS HEALTHY CONTEMPT FOR THE SPIRIT DICTATING SUCH SPEECHES
IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL ANOTHER WATERPROOF SHEET WAS SPREAD OVER THAT TABLE IN THE MANNER OF A TABLE CLOTH WITH THE CORNERS TURNED UP OVER A SORT OF MOUND A HEAP OF RAGS SCORCHED AND BLOODSTAINED
SHOOK HIM ALL OVER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS LED TO ADD AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT NOT YET WHEN I WANT YOU I WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU
ASKED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH SCORNFUL HASTE LIKE A MAN IN A HURRY WHO PERCEIVES HE IS WASTING HIS TIME THE PERFECT ANARCHIST ANSWERED BY A SMILE WHICH DID NOT PART HIS THIN COLOURLESS LIPS
THEY WERE HIS FELLOW CITIZENS GONE WRONG BECAUSE OF IMPERFECT EDUCATION CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT BELIEVED BUT ALLOWING FOR THAT DIFFERENCE HE COULD UNDERSTAND THE MIND OF A BURGLAR BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT
PUSHING ON BLIND AND ORDERLY AND ABSORBED IMPERVIOUS TO SENTIMENT TO LOGIC TO TERROR TOO PERHAPS THAT WAS THE FORM OF DOUBT HE FEARED MOST IMPERVIOUS TO FEAR OFTEN WHILE WALKING ABROAD
CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
WHILE STILL LAUGHING HE MOVED ON BUT HE DID NOT LAUGH LONG IT WAS A SAD FACED MISERABLE LITTLE MAN WHO EMERGED FROM THE NARROW PASSAGE INTO THE BUSTLE OF THE BROAD THOROUGHFARE
ARRESTED WITHIN SIX PACES OF THE ANARCHIST NICK NAMED THE PROFESSOR GAVE A THOUGHT OF REGRET TO THE WORLD OF THIEVES SANE WITHOUT MORBID IDEALS WORKING BY ROUTINE RESPECTFUL OF CONSTITUTED
SHE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE BIG ONE BUT THE OTHER WAS A FAIR SLIGHT CHAP CARRYING A TIN VARNISH CAN IN ONE HAND THE CONSTABLE CEASED KNOW THE WOMAN MUTTERED THE CHIEF INSPECTOR
THE ATROCIOUS ALLUSIVENESS OF THE WORDS HAD ITS EFFECT ON CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
HE HAD MADE THAT STATEMENT WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE HIGH OFFICIAL DESIRED GREATLY TO HEAR THAT VERY THING
DISORDERLY WITHOUT THE HUMAN EXCUSE OF DRUNKENNESS WHICH AT ANY RATE IMPLIES GOOD FEELING AND AN AMIABLE LEANING TOWARDS FESTIVITY AS CRIMINALS ANARCHISTS WERE DISTINCTLY NO CLASS NO CLASS AT ALL
THAT HOWEVER APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE THE FIRST TERM OF THE PROBLEM WAS UNREADABLE LACKED ALL SUGGESTION BUT THAT OF ATROCIOUS CRUELTY OVERCOMING HIS PHYSICAL REPUGNANCE
AS THE DOCTORS ARE TO EXAMINE CLOSELY THE MANGLED REMAINS OF HUMAN BEINGS
FOR A MAN OF REAL CONVICTIONS THIS IS A FINE OPPORTUNITY OF SELF SACRIFICE YOU MAY NOT FIND ANOTHER SO FAVOURABLE SO HUMANE THERE ISN'T EVEN A CAT NEAR US
BUT NOT QUITE FREE OF THAT JEALOUS MISTRUST WHICH SO OFTEN SPRINGS ON THE GROUND OF PERFECT DEVOTION WHETHER TO WOMEN OR TO INSTITUTIONS IT WAS IN THIS MENTAL DISPOSITION PHYSICALLY VERY EMPTY
WHOSE MORALITY WAS ARTIFICIAL CORRUPT AND BLASPHEMOUS
IN ORDER TO REACH SOONER THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TAKE HIS OMNIBUS HE TURNED BRUSQUELY OUT OF THE POPULOUS STREET INTO A NARROW AND DUSKY ALLEY PAVED WITH FLAGSTONES
AN UNHAPPY HOMELESS COUCH ACCOMPANIED BY TWO UNRELATED CHAIRS STOOD IN THE OPEN THE ONLY HUMAN BEING MAKING USE OF THE ALLEY BESIDES THE PROFESSOR COMING STALWART AND ERECT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMED FORCED UPON HIM THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT A LITTLE ON THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT BUT FATE LOOKS AT NOTHING IT HAS NO DISCRETION
CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT FELT VERY ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING STOPPED FOR HAVING SPOKEN FOR HAVING TAKEN THAT WAY AT ALL
BUT NEITHER WERE THE THIEVES HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AFTER THEY SUBMITTED TO THE SEVERE SANCTIONS OF A MORALITY FAMILIAR TO CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH A CERTAIN RESIGNATION
A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW THE LAST OBSERVED IN A PLACID TONE AND PAUSED THE OLD WOMAN WHO SPOKE TO THE SERGEANT NOTICED A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW COMING OUT OF MAZE HILL STATION HE PAUSED
INSTANTANEOUS HE REMEMBERED ALL HE HAD EVER READ IN POPULAR PUBLICATIONS OF LONG AND TERRIFYING DREAMS DREAMED IN THE INSTANT OF WAKING
BUT HAVEN'T YOU MADE YOUR NAME SIMPLY BY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE AFTER
FAIR SLIGHT SLIGHT ENOUGH LOOK AT THAT FOOT THERE I PICKED UP THE LEGS FIRST
AND THE CELEBRATED CHIEF INSPECTOR FELT A SENSE OF SUPERIORITY WHICH INDUCED HIM TO RAISE A WARNING FINGER GIVE IT UP WHATEVER IT IS HE SAID IN AN ADMONISHING TONE
AT THAT TIME HE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE KING WILLIAM STREET LODGE TALKING TO THE KEEPER THE CONCUSSION MADE HIM TINGLE ALL OVER HE RAN BETWEEN THE TREES TOWARDS THE OBSERVATORY AS FAST AS MY LEGS WOULD CARRY ME HE REPEATED TWICE
YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING A MESS OF IT
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW YOURSELVES YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING BY IT MEANTIME IT'S YOU WHO GET SOMETHING FROM IT SO FAR AND YOU GET IT EASILY TOO I WON'T SPEAK OF YOUR SALARY
THE CONSTABLE PAUSED THE LEAST FLICKER OF AN INNOCENT SELF LAUDATORY SMILE INVESTED HIS ROUND FACE WITH AN INFANTILE EXPRESSION STUMBLED HE ANNOUNCED POSITIVELY I STUMBLED ONCE MYSELF
AND THE SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS ATTENTION OF AN INDIGENT CUSTOMER BENDING OVER WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE BY PRODUCTS OF A BUTCHER'S SHOP WITH A VIEW TO AN INEXPENSIVE SUNDAY DINNER
THE POPULATION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND EVEN THE TEEMING MILLIONS STRUGGLING UPON THE PLANET WERE WITH HIM DOWN TO THE VERY THIEVES AND MENDICANTS YES THE THIEVES THEMSELVES WERE SURE TO BE WITH HIM IN HIS PRESENT WORK
IT WAS IN REALITY A CHANCE MEETING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD HAD A DISAGREEABLY BUSY DAY SINCE HIS DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THE FIRST TELEGRAM FROM GREENWICH A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN IN THE MORNING FIRST OF ALL
OR ELSE THE HEROES WOULD HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR OWN CLOTHES LIKEWISE NO DEPARTMENT APPEARS PERFECTLY WISE TO THE INTIMACY OF ITS WORKERS A DEPARTMENT DOES NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS SOME OF ITS SERVANTS BEING A DISPASSIONATE ORGANISM
OR PERHAPS OF APPEASED CONSCIENCE LOST IN THE CROWD MISERABLE AND UNDERSIZED HE MEDITATED CONFIDENTLY ON HIS POWER KEEPING HIS HAND IN THE LEFT POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS
AND TOO MUCH EXACT INFORMATION AS WELL TO DISMISS THEM AS ROT THE DUSK OF THIS NARROW LANE TOOK ON A SINISTER TINT FROM THE DARK FRAIL LITTLE FIGURE ITS BACK TO THE WALL
THIEVING WAS NOT A SHEER ABSURDITY
IT WOULD HAVE ALARMED HIS SUPERIORS AND DONE AWAY WITH HIS CHANCES OF PROMOTION HIS PROMOTION HAD BEEN VERY RAPID THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM SIR THAT WE COULDN'T LAY OUR HANDS ON AT ANY TIME OF NIGHT AND DAY
IT WAS LABOUR WHOSE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE FROM THE OTHER FORMS OF LABOUR CONSISTED IN THE NATURE OF ITS RISK WHICH DID NOT LIE IN ANKYLOSIS OR LEAD POISONING OR FIRE DAMP OR GRITTY DUST
ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU AT ONCE NONE OF OUR LOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HE WAS STRONG IN HIS INTEGRITY OF A GOOD DETECTIVE BUT HE SAW NOW THAT AN IMPENETRABLY ATTENTIVE RESERVE TOWARDS THIS INCIDENT
THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH AND ESTABLISHES A SORT OF AMENITY IN THEIR RELATIONS PRODUCTS OF THE SAME MACHINE ONE CLASSED AS USEFUL AND THE OTHER AS NOXIOUS THEY TAKE THE MACHINE FOR GRANTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
AND ONLY AFTER STUFFING IT INTO HIS POCKET TURNED ROUND TO THE ROOM AND FLUNG THE VELVET COLLAR BACK ON THE TABLE COVER UP HE DIRECTED THE ATTENDANTS CURTLY WITHOUT ANOTHER LOOK
HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY CURIOUS BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VINDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS DEPARTMENT
EVEN TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON HIDDEN BY THE ENORMOUS PILES OF BRICKS HE FELT THE MASS OF MANKIND MIGHTY IN ITS NUMBERS THEY SWARMED NUMEROUS LIKE LOCUSTS INDUSTRIOUS LIKE ANTS THOUGHTLESS LIKE A NATURAL FORCE
CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE MORE ENERGETIC FORMS OF THIEVING HE HAD GAINED HIS SPURS IN THAT SPHERE AND NATURALLY ENOUGH HAD KEPT FOR IT AFTER HIS PROMOTION TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT A FEELING NOT VERY FAR REMOVED FROM AFFECTION
IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
FUNNY THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THE VELVET COLLAR DARK BLUE OVERCOAT WITH A VELVET COLLAR SHE HAS TOLD US HE WAS THE CHAP SHE SAW AND NO MISTAKE AND HERE HE IS ALL COMPLETE VELVET COLLAR AND ALL
THIS MORAL ATTITUDE TRANSLATED ITSELF INTO A FRENZIED PURITANISM OF AMBITION HE NURSED IT AS SOMETHING SECULARLY HOLY TO SEE IT THWARTED OPENED HIS EYES TO THE TRUE NATURE OF THE WORLD
THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL THE HIGH OFFICIAL BELIEVED THE DECLARATION WHICH CHIMED IN WITH HIS IDEA OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS HIS WISDOM WAS OF AN OFFICIAL KIND OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED UPON A MATTER NOT OF THEORY
LIKELY TO REMAIN FOR EVER UNKNOWN
IT WAS LONGER THAN THE SQUIRE IMAGINED ERE WE WERE READY FOR THE SEA AND NONE OF OUR FIRST PLANS NOT EVEN DOCTOR LIVESEY'S OF KEEPING ME BESIDE HIM COULD BE CARRIED OUT AS WE INTENDED
I HAD A HUNDRED OPPORTUNITIES OF SETTING HIM RIGHT AND PUTTING HIM DOWN AND I WAS NOT SLOW TO PROFIT BY THEM THE NIGHT PASSED AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER DINNER
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE DISPOSAL OF A FEW TABLES AND CHAIRS BRASS BEDSTEADS AND SO ON MAY BE BIG WITH REMOTE AND DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES SHE REQUIRED A FEW PIECES HERSELF
SHE FAVOURED HER DAUGHTER BY AN EXHAUSTIVE ANSWER FULL OF NAMES AND ENRICHED BY SIDE COMMENTS UPON THE RAVAGES OF TIME AS OBSERVED IN THE ALTERATION OF HUMAN COUNTENANCES
HIS SABRE CUT CHEEK AND HIS OLD BRASS TELESCOPE NEXT MOMENT WE HAD TURNED THE CORNER AND MY HOME WAS OUT OF SIGHT THE MAIL PICKED US UP ABOUT DUSK AT THE ROYAL GEORGE ON THE HEATH
UNDER THE IMMORTAL HAWKE HE HAS NO PENSION LIVESEY IMAGINE THE ABOMINABLE AGE WE LIVE IN WELL SIR I THOUGHT I HAD ONLY FOUND A COOK BUT IT WAS A CREW I HAD DISCOVERED BETWEEN SILVER AND MYSELF
DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW DON'T YOU PERHAPS YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO RIGHTLY KNOW WHO YOU WAS SPEAKING TO PERHAPS COME NOW
I WAS WEDGED IN BETWEEN REDRUTH AND A STOUT OLD GENTLEMAN AND IN SPITE OF THE SWIFT MOTION AND THE COLD NIGHT AIR I MUST HAVE DOZED A GREAT DEAL FROM THE VERY FIRST AND THEN SLEPT LIKE A LOG UP HILL AND DOWN DALE
HANGING TO THREADS THAT SEEMED NO THICKER THAN A SPIDER'S THOUGH I HAD LIVED BY THE SHORE ALL MY LIFE I SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE BEEN NEAR THE SEA TILL THEN THE SMELL OF TAR AND SALT WAS SOMETHING NEW
OBEYING THIS ORDER WE FOUND OR RATHER I FOUND FOR THE GAMEKEEPER WAS A POOR HAND AT READING ANYTHING BUT PRINT THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NEWS OLD ANCHOR INN
THE DOCTOR HAD TO GO TO LONDON FOR A PHYSICIAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS PRACTICE THE SQUIRE WAS HARD AT WORK AT BRISTOL AND I LIVED ON AT THE HALL UNDER THE CHARGE OF OLD REDRUTH THE GAMEKEEPER ALMOST A PRISONER
THE LAST CAB DRIVE OF MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER'S LIFE THEY WENT OUT AT THE SHOP DOOR THE CONVEYANCE AWAITING THEM WOULD HAVE ILLUSTRATED THE PROVERB THAT TRUTH CAN BE MORE CRUEL THAN CARICATURE IF SUCH A PROVERB EXISTED
AND AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING BRETT STREET SHE HAD SAID TO HER DAUGHTER NO USE WAITING TILL I AM DEAD IS THERE EVERYTHING I LEAVE HERE IS ALTOGETHER YOUR OWN NOW MY DEAR WINNIE WITH HER HAT ON
THERE IS A CLASS OF MEN IN BRISTOL MONSTROUSLY PREJUDICED AGAINST BLANDLY THEY GO THE LENGTH OF DECLARING THAT THIS HONEST CREATURE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY THAT THE HISPANIOLA BELONGED TO HIM AND THAT HE SOLD IT ME ABSURDLY HIGH
AND KEEPING A BRIGHT LOOKOUT FOR A LITTLE TAVERN WITH A LARGE BRASS TELESCOPE FOR SIGN I SET OFF OVERJOYED AT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME MORE OF THE SHIPS AND SEAMEN
WITH A GENTLE SAD VOICE BUT SO VERY VERY THIN AND QUIET HE WAS LIKE A SHADOW MY DEAR WINNIE PROLONGING HER DUSTING OPERATIONS TILL THE TALE WAS TOLD TO THE END
THE FLOATING AMPLENESS OF HER ANCIENT FORM AND THE IMPOTENT CONDITION OF HER LEGS THE SHOCK OF THE INFORMATION WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT MISSUS VERLOC AGAINST HER USUAL PRACTICE WHEN ADDRESSED
WHICH WAS HER FORCE AND HER SAFEGUARD IN LIFE WEREN'T YOU MADE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH HERE SHE HAD LAPSED INTO THESE INQUIRIES BUT NEXT MOMENT SHE SAVED THE CONSISTENCY OF HER CONDUCT BY RESUMING HER DUSTING
BUT I WILL SAY THIS JOHN SILVER SUITS ME THE MAN'S A PERFECT TRUMP DECLARED THE SQUIRE AND NOW ADDED THE DOCTOR JIM MAY COME ON BOARD WITH US MAY HE NOT
CATCHING SIGHT OF A HOOKED IRON CONTRIVANCE PROTRUDING FROM THE LEFT SLEEVE OF THE MAN'S COAT MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER LOST SUDDENLY THE HEROIC COURAGE OF THESE DAYS SHE REALLY COULDN'T TRUST HERSELF
HAVING INFUSED BY PERSISTENT IMPORTUNITIES SOME SORT OF HEAT INTO THE CHILLY INTEREST OF SEVERAL LICENSED VICTUALLERS THE ACQUAINTANCES ONCE UPON A TIME OF HER LATE UNLUCKY HUSBAND
DOCTOR LIVESEY WILL NOT LIKE THAT THE SQUIRE HAS BEEN TALKING AFTER ALL WELL WHO'S A BETTER RIGHT GROWLED THE GAMEKEEPER A PRETTY RUM GO IF SQUIRE AIN'T TO TALK FOR DOCTOR LIVESEY I SHOULD THINK
AND THAT SO HEARTILY THAT THOUGH I DID NOT SEE THE JOKE AS HE DID I WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO JOIN HIM IN HIS MIRTH ON OUR LITTLE WALK ALONG THE QUAYS HE MADE HIMSELF THE MOST INTERESTING COMPANION
MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER HAD AT LAST SECURED HER ADMISSION TO CERTAIN ALMSHOUSES FOUNDED BY A WEALTHY INNKEEPER FOR THE DESTITUTE WIDOWS OF THE TRADE THIS END
SHE WAS ONLY A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THIS SUDDEN MANIA FOR LOCOMOTION MISTER VERLOC WHO WAS SUFFICIENTLY MAGNIFICENT IN HIS WAY HAD GRUNTED THE REMARK IMPATIENTLY ASIDE
HE USED TO COME HERE WITH A BLIND BEGGAR HE USED THAT HE DID YOU MAY BE SURE SAID I I KNEW THAT BLIND MAN TOO HIS NAME WAS PEW
AT THAT I GAVE UP ALL ATTEMPTS AT COMMENTARY AND READ STRAIGHT ON BLANDLY HIMSELF FOUND THE HISPANIOLA AND BY THE MOST ADMIRABLE MANAGEMENT GOT HER FOR THE MEREST TRIFLE
ON WHICH MISTER VERLOC LOVED TO TAKE HIS EASE IN HAT AND OVERCOAT SHE WAS INTENT ON HER WORK BUT PRESENTLY SHE PERMITTED HERSELF ANOTHER QUESTION HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU MANAGE IT MOTHER
I SAW THE MOST WONDERFUL FIGUREHEADS THAT HAD ALL BEEN FAR OVER THE OCEAN I SAW BESIDES MANY OLD SAILORS WITH RINGS IN THEIR EARS AND WHISKERS CURLED IN RINGLETS AND TARRY PIGTAILS
THERE CAME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO DOCTOR LIVESEY WITH THIS ADDITION TO BE OPENED IN THE CASE OF HIS ABSENCE BY TOM REDRUTH OR YOUNG HAWKINS
HE SEEMED TO ME TO GIVE SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A START OH SAID HE QUITE LOUD AND OFFERING HIS HAND I SEE YOU ARE OUR NEW CABIN BOY PLEASED I AM TO SEE YOU
I AM IN THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS EATING LIKE A BULL SLEEPING LIKE A TREE YET I SHALL NOT ENJOY A MOMENT TILL I HEAR MY OLD TARPAULINS TRAMPING ROUND THE CAPSTAN SEAWARD HO HANG THE TREASURE
WHEN WE GOT TO THE INN THE SQUIRE AND DOCTOR LIVESEY WERE SEATED TOGETHER FINISHING A QUART OF ALE WITH A TOAST IN IT
THE TWO GENTLEMEN REGRETTED THAT BLACK DOG HAD GOT AWAY BUT WE ALL AGREED THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE AND AFTER HE HAD BEEN COMPLIMENTED LONG JOHN TOOK UP HIS CRUTCH AND DEPARTED
WITH INFINITE PATIENCE LATER ON IN THE WIDER SPACE OF WHITEHALL ALL VISUAL EVIDENCES OF MOTION BECAME IMPERCEPTIBLE THE RATTLE AND JINGLE OF GLASS
BUT HIS HURRY HAD ATTRACTED MY NOTICE AND I RECOGNIZED HIM AT GLANCE IT WAS THE TALLOW FACED MAN WANTING TWO FINGERS WHO HAD COME FIRST TO THE ADMIRAL BENBOW OH I CRIED STOP HIM IT'S BLACK DOG
ALL HANDS ABOARD BY FOUR THIS AFTERNOON SHOUTED THE SQUIRE AFTER HIM AYE AYE SIR CRIED THE COOK IN THE PASSAGE
THE ADMIRABLE FELLOW LITERALLY SLAVED IN MY INTEREST AND SO I MAY SAY DID EVERYONE IN BRISTOL AS SOON AS THEY GOT WIND OF THE PORT WE SAILED FOR TREASURE I MEAN REDRUTH SAID I INTERRUPTING THE LETTER
HERE YOU COMES AND TELLS ME OF IT PLAIN AND HERE I LET HIM GIVE US ALL THE SLIP
HIS POSITION HAD TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE CLAIMS OF LEGAL JUSTICE AND EVEN THE PROMPTINGS OF PARTIALITY THE POSSESSION OF THE FURNITURE WOULD NOT BE IN ANY SENSE A PROVISION HE OUGHT TO HAVE IT THE POOR BOY
LAY ALONG THE QUAYS AND BESIDE THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF SHIPS OF ALL SIZES AND RIGS AND NATIONS IN ONE SAILORS WERE SINGING AT THEIR WORK IN ANOTHER THERE WERE MEN ALOFT HIGH OVER MY HEAD
BUT TO GIVE IT TO HIM WOULD BE LIKE TAMPERING WITH HIS POSITION OF COMPLETE DEPENDENCE IT WAS A SORT OF CLAIM WHICH SHE FEARED TO WEAKEN MOREOVER THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF MISTER VERLOC
YOU NEVER IMAGINED A SWEETER SCHOONER A CHILD MIGHT SAIL HER TWO HUNDRED TONS NAME HISPANIOLA I GOT HER THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND BLANDLY WHO HAS PROVED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE MOST SURPRISING TRUMP
WHO COULD DO NOTHING BUT GRUMBLE AND LAMENT ANY OF THE UNDER GAMEKEEPERS WOULD GLADLY HAVE CHANGED PLACES WITH HIM BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE SQUIRE'S PLEASURE AND THE SQUIRE'S PLEASURE WAS LIKE LAW AMONG THEM ALL
SILENT BEHIND HER MOTHER'S BACK WENT ON ARRANGING THE COLLAR OF THE OLD WOMAN'S CLOAK SHE GOT HER HAND BAG AN UMBRELLA WITH AN IMPASSIVE FACE THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF THE SUM OF THREE AND SIXPENCE
KNEW ALL THE SEAFARING MEN IN BRISTOL HAD LOST HIS HEALTH ASHORE AND WANTED A GOOD BERTH AS COOK TO GET TO SEA AGAIN HE HAD HOBBLED DOWN THERE THAT MORNING HE SAID TO GET A SMELL OF THE SALT I WAS MONSTROUSLY TOUCHED
THE DELICACY GUIDING HER CHOICE TO THE LEAST VALUABLE AND MOST DILAPIDATED ARTICLES PASSED UNACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE WINNIE'S PHILOSOPHY CONSISTED IN NOT TAKING NOTICE OF THE INSIDE OF FACTS
LEANING OVER FROM HIS BOX HE WHISPERED WITH MYSTERIOUS INDIGNATION WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO TREAT A MAN SO HIS ENORMOUS AND UNWASHED COUNTENANCE FLAMED RED
THAT WERE HIS NAME FOR CERTAIN AH HE LOOKED A SHARK HE DID IF WE RUN DOWN THIS BLACK DOG NOW THERE'LL BE NEWS FOR CAP'N TRELAWNEY BEN'S A GOOD RUNNER FEW SEAMEN RUN BETTER THAN BEN HE SHOULD RUN HIM DOWN HAND OVER HAND BY THE POWERS
J T YOU CAN FANCY THE EXCITEMENT INTO WHICH THAT LETTER PUT ME I WAS HALF BESIDE MYSELF WITH GLEE
IT'S THE GLORY OF THE SEA THAT HAS TURNED MY HEAD SO NOW LIVESEY COME POST DO NOT LOSE AN HOUR IF YOU RESPECT ME LET YOUNG HAWKINS GO AT ONCE TO SEE HIS MOTHER WITH REDRUTH FOR A GUARD AND THEN BOTH COME FULL SPEED TO BRISTOL
TELLING ME ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SHIPS THAT WE PASSED BY THEIR RIG TONNAGE AND NATIONALITY EXPLAINING THE WORK THAT WAS GOING FORWARD HOW ONE WAS DISCHARGING ANOTHER TAKING IN CARGO AND A THIRD MAKING READY FOR SEA
THE NAMES WERE PRINCIPALLY THE NAMES OF LICENSED VICTUALLERS POOR DADDY'S FRIENDS MY DEAR SHE ENLARGED WITH SPECIAL APPRECIATION ON THE KINDNESS AND CONDESCENSION OF A LARGE BREWER A BARONET AND AN M P
WE GOT TOGETHER IN A FEW DAYS A COMPANY OF THE TOUGHEST OLD SALTS IMAGINABLE NOT PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT FELLOWS BY THEIR FACES OF THE MOST INDOMITABLE SPIRIT I DECLARE WE COULD FIGHT A FRIGATE
AND NOW AT SIGHT OF THIS CLUMSY STRANGER WHO WAS TO STAY HERE IN MY PLACE BESIDE MY MOTHER I HAD MY FIRST ATTACK OF TEARS I AM AFRAID I LED THAT BOY A DOG'S LIFE FOR AS HE WAS NEW TO THE WORK
AND I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT A BUCCANEER WAS LIKE A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE ACCORDING TO ME FROM THIS CLEAN AND PLEASANT TEMPERED LANDLORD I PLUCKED UP COURAGE AT ONCE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND WALKED RIGHT UP TO THE MAN WHERE HE STOOD
WE WAS A TALKIN OF KEEL HAULING ANSWERED MORGAN KEEL HAULING WAS YOU AND A MIGHTY SUITABLE THING TOO AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT GET BACK TO YOUR PLACE FOR A LUBBER TOM AND THEN AS MORGAN ROLLED BACK TO HIS SEAT
OF VAIN EFFORT AND ILLUSORY APPEARANCES HER SELECTION MADE THE DISPOSAL OF THE REST BECAME A PERPLEXING QUESTION IN A PARTICULAR WAY SHE WAS LEAVING IT IN BRETT STREET OF COURSE
MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER GAVE PLAY TO HER ASTUTENESS IN THE DIRECTION OF HER FURNITURE BECAUSE IT WAS HER OWN AND SOMETIMES SHE WISHED IT HADN'T BEEN HEROISM IS ALL VERY WELL BUT
AND HE TOOK MY HAND IN HIS LARGE FIRM GRASP JUST THEN ONE OF THE CUSTOMERS AT THE FAR SIDE ROSE SUDDENLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR IT WAS CLOSE BY HIM AND HE WAS OUT IN THE STREET IN A MOMENT
INTERRUPTED THE DOMESTIC OCCUPATION SHE WAS ENGAGED UPON IT WAS THE DUSTING OF THE FURNITURE IN THE PARLOUR BEHIND THE SHOP SHE TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HER MOTHER
HER SOUL WAS TRIUMPHANT AND HER HEART TREMULOUS INWARDLY SHE QUAKED BECAUSE SHE DREADED AND ADMIRED THE CALM SELF CONTAINED CHARACTER OF HER DAUGHTER WINNIE WHOSE DISPLEASURE WAS MADE REDOUBTABLE
SOMEWHERE OUT OF THAT A DIVISION ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER CAREFULLY MADE MIGHT GIVE SOME CAUSE OF OFFENCE TO WINNIE NO STEVIE MUST REMAIN DESTITUTE AND DEPENDENT
HAD ACQUIRED A DISMAL BUT RESIGNED NOTION OF THE FANTASTIC SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE WHAT IF MISTER VERLOC SUDDENLY TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD
HE'S BEEN DRIVING A CAB FOR TWENTY YEARS I NEVER KNEW HIM TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT ACCIDENT SHOUTED THE DRIVER IN A SCORNFUL WHISPER THE POLICEMAN'S TESTIMONY SETTLED IT THE MODEST ASSEMBLAGE OF SEVEN PEOPLE
SEE HERE NOW HAWKINS SAID HE HERE'S A BLESSED HARD THING ON A MAN LIKE ME NOW AIN'T IT THERE'S CAP'N TRELAWNEY WHAT'S HE TO THINK HERE I HAVE THIS CONFOUNDED SON OF A DUTCHMAN SITTING IN MY OWN HOUSE DRINKING OF MY OWN RUM
AND REPORT THIS HERE AFFAIR FOR MIND YOU IT'S SERIOUS YOUNG HAWKINS
SO WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN AND OUT OF PURE PITY I ENGAGED HIM ON THE SPOT TO BE SHIP'S COOK LONG JOHN SILVER HE IS CALLED AND HAS LOST A LEG BUT THAT I REGARDED AS A RECOMMENDATION SINCE HE LOST IT IN HIS COUNTRY'S SERVICE
POSTSCRIPT I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT BLANDLY WHO BY THE WAY IS TO SEND A CONSORT AFTER US IF WE DON'T TURN UP BY THE END OF AUGUST HAD FOUND AN ADMIRABLE FELLOW FOR SAILING MASTER A STIFF MAN WHICH I REGRET
WOULD PERHAPS NOT BROOK BEING BEHOLDEN TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW FOR THE CHAIRS HE SAT ON IN A LONG EXPERIENCE OF GENTLEMEN LODGERS MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO LONG BEEN A CAUSE OF SO MUCH DISCOMFORT WAS GONE WHERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING THE SQUIRE HAD HAD EVERYTHING REPAIRED AND THE PUBLIC ROOMS AND THE SIGN REPAINTED
AND HIS JAW DROPPED AS THOUGH HE HAD REMEMBERED SOMETHING THE SCORE HE BURST OUT THREE GOES O RUM WHY SHIVER MY TIMBERS IF I HADN'T FORGOTTEN MY SCORE AND FALLING ON A BENCH HE LAUGHED UNTIL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
BY THE POWERS TOM MORGAN IT'S AS GOOD FOR YOU EXCLAIMED THE LANDLORD IF YOU HAD BEEN MIXED UP WITH THE LIKE OF THAT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE PUT ANOTHER FOOT IN MY HOUSE YOU MAY LAY TO THAT AND WHAT WAS HE SAYING TO YOU I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW SIR ANSWERED MORGAN
PROPPED ON HIS CRUTCH TALKING TO A CUSTOMER MISTER SILVER SIR I ASKED HOLDING OUT THE NOTE YES MY LAD SAID HE SUCH IS MY NAME TO BE SURE AND WHO MAY YOU BE AND THEN AS HE SAW THE SQUIRE'S LETTER
WHATEVER DID YOU WANT TO DO THAT FOR SHE EXCLAIMED IN SCANDALISED ASTONISHMENT THE SHOCK MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE TO MAKE HER DEPART FROM THAT DISTANT AND UNINQUIRING ACCEPTANCE OF FACTS
BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS A TREASURE LONG JOHN SILVER UNEARTHED A VERY COMPETENT MAN FOR A MATE A MAN NAMED ARROW I HAVE A BOATSWAIN WHO PIPES LIVESEY SO THINGS SHALL GO MAN O' WAR FASHION ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP HISPANIOLA
LONG JOHN TOLD THE STORY FROM FIRST TO LAST WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SPIRIT AND THE MOST PERFECT TRUTH THAT WAS HOW IT WERE NOW WEREN'T IT HAWKINS HE WOULD SAY NOW AND AGAIN AND I COULD ALWAYS BEAR HIM ENTIRELY OUT
CRAWLING BEHIND AN INFIRM HORSE A METROPOLITAN HACKNEY CARRIAGE DREW UP ON WOBBLY WHEELS AND WITH A MAIMED DRIVER ON THE BOX THIS LAST PECULIARITY CAUSED SOME EMBARRASSMENT
THE MOST TRANSPARENT CALUMNIES NONE OF THEM DARE HOWEVER TO DENY THE MERITS OF THE SHIP SO FAR THERE WAS NOT A HITCH THE WORKPEOPLE TO BE SURE RIGGERS AND WHAT NOT WERE MOST ANNOYINGLY SLOW BUT TIME CURED THAT
WALKED OUT OF THE PARLOUR INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS IN HER USUAL MANNER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST COMMENT
WHILE THE OLD WOMAN SAT SCARED AND DUMB UNDER HER DINGY WHITE CAP AND LUSTRELESS DARK WIG WINNIE FINISHED THE CHAIR AND RAN THE DUSTER ALONG THE MAHOGANY AT THE BACK OF THE HORSE HAIR SOFA
IN SPITE OF CLOUDS OF TOBACCO SMOKE THE CUSTOMERS WERE MOSTLY SEAFARING MEN AND THEY TALKED SO LOUDLY THAT I HUNG AT THE DOOR ALMOST AFRAID TO ENTER AS I WAS WAITING A MAN CAME OUT OF A SIDE ROOM
AND PICKED MY WAY AMONG A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE AND CARTS AND BALES FOR THE DOCK WAS NOW AT ITS BUSIEST UNTIL I FOUND THE TAVERN IN QUESTION IT WAS A BRIGHT ENOUGH LITTLE PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT
I CLIMBED A THOUSAND TIMES TO THAT TALL HILL THEY CALL THE SPY GLASS AND FROM THE TOP ENJOYED THE MOST WONDERFUL AND CHANGING PROSPECTS SOMETIMES THE ISLE WAS THICK WITH SAVAGES WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT
WENT ON INDEFINITELY IN FRONT OF THE LONG TREASURY BUILDING AND TIME ITSELF SEEMED TO STAND STILL AT LAST WINNIE OBSERVED THIS ISN'T A VERY GOOD HORSE
THE FOUNDATION WHICH AFTER MANY IMPORTUNITIES HAD GATHERED HER TO ITS CHARITABLE BREAST GIVING NOTHING BUT BARE PLANKS AND CHEAPLY PAPERED BRICKS TO THE OBJECTS OF ITS SOLICITUDE
AND THE DEAR OLD ADMIRAL BENBOW SINCE HE WAS REPAINTED NO LONGER QUITE SO DEAR ONE OF MY LAST THOUGHTS WAS OF THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO OFTEN STRODE ALONG THE BEACH WITH HIS COCKED HAT
THROUGH STAGE AFTER STAGE FOR WHEN I WAS AWAKENED AT LAST IT WAS BY A PUNCH IN THE RIBS AND I OPENED MY EYES TO FIND THAT WE WERE STANDING STILL BEFORE A LARGE BUILDING IN A CITY STREET
SOMETIMES FULL OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS THAT HUNTED US BUT IN ALL MY FANCIES NOTHING OCCURRED TO ME SO STRANGE AND TRAGIC AS OUR ACTUAL ADVENTURES SO THE WEEKS PASSED ON TILL ONE FINE DAY
LONG JOHN EVEN GOT RID OF TWO OUT OF THE SIX OR SEVEN I HAD ALREADY ENGAGED HE SHOWED ME IN A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE JUST THE SORT OF FRESH WATER SWABS WE HAD TO FEAR IN AN ADVENTURE OF IMPORTANCE
ROLLING HIS QUID NOW MORGAN SAID LONG JOHN VERY STERNLY YOU NEVER CLAPPED YOUR EYES ON THAT BLACK BLACK DOG BEFORE DID YOU NOW NOT I SIR SAID MORGAN WITH A SALUTE YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME DID YOU NO SIR
WHEN I HAD DONE BREAKFASTING THE SQUIRE GAVE ME A NOTE ADDRESSED TO JOHN SILVER AT THE SIGN OF THE SPY GLASS AND TOLD ME I SHOULD EASILY FIND THE PLACE BY FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE DOCKS
SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM I APPROACHED THAT ISLAND IN MY FANCY FROM EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION I EXPLORED EVERY ACRE OF ITS SURFACE
AND THAT THE DAY HAD ALREADY BROKEN A LONG TIME WHERE ARE WE I ASKED BRISTOL SAID TOM GET DOWN MISTER TRELAWNEY HAD TAKEN UP HIS RESIDENCE AT AN INN FAR DOWN THE DOCKS TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK UPON THE SCHOONER
I COULD NOT HELP JOINING AND WE LAUGHED TOGETHER PEAL AFTER PEAL UNTIL THE TAVERN RANG AGAIN WHY WHAT A PRECIOUS OLD SEA CALF I AM HE SAID AT LAST WIPING HIS CHEEKS YOU AND ME SHOULD GET ON WELL HAWKINS
BUT SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN WINNIE WAS PROVIDED FOR BY HER SENSIBLE UNION WITH THAT EXCELLENT HUSBAND MISTER VERLOC STEVIE WAS DESTITUTE AND A LITTLE PECULIAR
IN THE MUDDY STRETCH OF THE STREET WAS IT LIKELY THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A LICENCE HE INQUIRED DESPERATELY IF THE POLICE CONSTABLE OF THE LOCALITY QUIETED HIM BY A FRIENDLY GLANCE
WITH A MERRY WORD OR A SLAP ON THE SHOULDER FOR THE MORE FAVOURED OF HIS GUESTS NOW TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH FROM THE VERY FIRST MENTION OF LONG JOHN IN SQUIRE TRELAWNEY'S LETTER I HAD TAKEN A FEAR IN MY MIND
TILL THE MOST REMARKABLE STROKE OF FORTUNE BROUGHT ME THE VERY MAN THAT I REQUIRED I WAS STANDING ON THE DOCK WHEN BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I FELL IN TALK WITH HIM I FOUND HE WAS AN OLD SAILOR KEPT A PUBLIC HOUSE
IN THE NARROW STREETS THE PROGRESS OF THE JOURNEY WAS MADE SENSIBLE TO THOSE WITHIN BY THE NEAR FRONTS OF THE HOUSES GLIDING PAST SLOWLY AND SHAKILY WITH A GREAT RATTLE AND JINGLING OF GLASS
NOBODY BUT OLD REDRUTH WOULD HAVE DARED SO MUCH AS EVEN TO GRUMBLE THE NEXT MORNING HE AND I SET OUT ON FOOT FOR THE ADMIRAL BENBOW AND THERE I FOUND MY MOTHER IN GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS
FOR I'LL TAKE MY DAVY I SHOULD BE RATED SHIP'S BOY BUT COME NOW STAND BY TO GO ABOUT THIS WON'T DO DOOTY IS DOOTY MESSMATES I'LL PUT ON MY OLD COCKEREL HAT AND STEP ALONG OF YOU TO CAP'N TRELAWNEY
IT WAS THE CREW THAT TROUBLED ME I WISHED A ROUND SCORE OF MEN IN CASE OF NATIVES BUCCANEERS OR THE ODIOUS FRENCH AND I HAD THE WORRY OF THE DEUCE ITSELF TO FIND SO MUCH AS HALF A DOZEN
BY A DIVERSITY OF DREADFUL SILENCES BUT SHE DID NOT ALLOW HER INWARD APPREHENSIONS TO ROB HER OF THE ADVANTAGE OF VENERABLE PLACIDITY CONFERRED UPON HER OUTWARD PERSON BY HER TRIPLE CHIN
BUT HE WAS TOO DEEP AND TOO READY AND TOO CLEVER FOR ME AND BY THE TIME THE TWO MEN HAD COME BACK OUT OF BREATH AND CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD LOST THE TRACK IN A CROWD AND BEEN SCOLDED LIKE THIEVES I WOULD HAVE GONE BAIL FOR THE INNOCENCE OF LONG JOHN SILVER
AND AT A GLANCE I WAS SURE HE MUST BE LONG JOHN HIS LEFT LEG WAS CUT OFF CLOSE BY THE HIP AND UNDER THE LEFT SHOULDER HE CARRIED A CRUTCH WHICH HE MANAGED WITH WONDERFUL DEXTERITY HOPPING ABOUT UPON IT LIKE A BIRD
AND HAD ADDED SOME FURNITURE ABOVE ALL A BEAUTIFUL ARMCHAIR FOR MOTHER IN THE BAR HE HAD FOUND HER A BOY AS AN APPRENTICE ALSO SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT WANT HELP WHILE I WAS GONE
AS IF ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BEHIND THE CAB AND THE INFIRM HORSE WITH THE HARNESS HUNG OVER HIS SHARP BACKBONE FLAPPING VERY LOOSE ABOUT HIS THIGHS APPEARED TO BE DANCING MINCINGLY ON HIS TOES
