FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND USELESS MOUTHS AND BACKS AND SECONDLY THERE BEING A ROUND MILLION OF CREATURES IN HUMANE FIGURE THROUGHOUT THIS KINGDOM
WITH NEITHER HOUSE NOR CLOATHS TO COVER THEM
AND FOR NO OTHER THAT EVER WAS IS OR I THINK EVER CAN BE UPON EARTH THEREFORE LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF OTHER EXPEDIENTS
THEY SHALL ON THE CONTRARY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEEDING AND PARTLY TO THE CLOATHING OF MANY THOUSANDS THERE IS LIKEWISE ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MY SCHEME
SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE IT IS A MELANCHOLY OBJECT TO THOSE WHO WALK THROUGH THIS GREAT TOWN OR TRAVEL IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY SEE THE STREETS THE ROADS AND CABBIN DOORS
BRINGS A TRAIN OF POWDER WAGONS THROUGH FIRES BUILT IN HIS PATH BY THE ENEMY'S SCOUTS HE LOSES EVERY ONE OF HIS MEN AND ALL BUT THE LAST WAGON WHICH HE DRIVES HIMSELF HIS RETURN WITH THAT AMMUNITION SAVES THE HARD FOUGHT DAY
OF BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS NOT TO SELL OUR COUNTRY AND CONSCIENCES FOR NOTHING
CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR
AND THE REST OF THE KINGDOM WHERE PROBABLY THEY WILL BE SOLD SOMEWHAT CHEAPER THE REMAINING EIGHTY THOUSAND
AND WHEN THE FAMILY DINES ALONE THE FORE OR HIND QUARTER WILL MAKE A REASONABLE DISH AND SEASONED WITH A LITTLE PEPPER OR SALT WILL BE VERY GOOD BOILED ON THE FOURTH DAY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER
IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION WHICH COULD BETTER BE CALLED THE OVERTHROW OF NEGRO RULE THE KU KLUX KLAN DASHES DOWN THE ROAD AS POWERFULLY AS NIAGARA POURS OVER THE CLIFF FINALLY THE WHITE GIRL ELSIE STONEMAN
TO BE ABOUT TWO SHILLINGS PER ANNUM RAGS INCLUDED
IMPERSONATED BY LILLIAN GISH IS RESCUED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN FROM THE MULATTO POLITICIAN SILAS LYNCH IMPERSONATED BY GEORGE SEIGMANN THE LADY IS BROUGHT FORWARD AS A TYPICAL HELPLESS WHITE MAIDEN
AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND
AND WHEN HE WILL GO TO THE PICTURE SHOW TO VERIFY IT THE SHODDIEST SILENT DRAMA MAY CONTAIN NOBLE VIEWS OF THE SEA THIS PART IS ALMOST SURE TO BE GOOD IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCE
BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN
THEY BESIEGE THE FOUNTAIN END OF THE STREET SPRINKLING WAGON QUITE CLOSELY REJOICING TO HAVE THEIR CLOTHES SOAKED THEY GATHER ROUND THE FIRE PLUG THAT IS TURNED ON FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND AGAIN BECOME WET AS DROWNED RATS PASSING THROUGH THESE CROWDS
WHO JUSTLY VALUE THEMSELVES UPON THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN GOOD EATING AND A SKILFUL COOK WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO OBLIGE HIS GUESTS WILL CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT AS EXPENSIVE AS THEY PLEASE SIXTHLY
THAT HAD BEEN PURSUING EACH OTHER EARLIER IN THE FILM OTHERWISE THE CONFLICT HOWEVER VIOLENT APPEALED MAINLY TO THE SENSE OF SPEED SO
THIS CROWD IS INTERPRETED IN ESPECIAL FOR US
AT A CERTAIN AGE WHO ARE BORN OF PARENTS IN EFFECT AS LITTLE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THOSE WHO DEMAND OUR CHARITY IN THE STREETS AS TO MY OWN PART HAVING TURNED MY THOUGHTS FOR MANY YEARS UPON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
AND THEREBY HAVE AVOIDED SUCH A PERPETUAL SCENE OF MISFORTUNES AS THEY HAVE SINCE GONE THROUGH BY THE OPPRESSION OF LANDLORDS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PAYING RENT WITHOUT MONEY OR TRADE THE WANT OF COMMON SUSTENANCE
WHO CAN WRITE NOVELS AND EPICS BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM WRITE PLAYS WELL THE FILM LENDS ITSELF ADMIRABLY TO THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS PROPER TO NARRATIVE AND EPIC BUT PHYSICALLY
THE MEASURE AND THE GOODNESS NOR COULD EVER YET BE BROUGHT TO MAKE ONE FAIR PROPOSAL OF JUST DEALING THOUGH OFTEN AND EARNESTLY INVITED TO IT THEREFORE I REPEAT
THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
NOURISHING AND WHOLESOME FOOD WHETHER STEWED ROASTED BAKED OR BOILED AND I MAKE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL EQUALLY SERVE IN A FRICASIE OR A RAGOUST
LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF THESE AND THE LIKE EXPEDIENTS TILL HE HATH AT LEAST SOME GLYMPSE OF HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVER BE SOME HEARTY AND SINCERE ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE BUT
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
CONTAINED MORE IN TWENTY MINUTES THAN THESE AMBITIOUS INCONTINENT SIX REEL DISPLAYS GIVE US IN TWO HOURS
ONE KIND OF A CROWD PICTURE
I DO THEREFORE HUMBLY OFFER IT TO PUBLICK CONSIDERATION THAT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ALREADY COMPUTED TWENTY THOUSAND MAY BE RESERVED FOR BREED WHEREOF ONLY ONE FOURTH PART TO BE MALES
THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
THE ORIGINAL BOOK BY THOMAS DIXON IT IS BAD WHEREVER IT IS UNADULTERATED GRIFFITH WHICH IS HALF THE TIME IT IS GOOD THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON IS A RATHER STAGY SIMON LEGREE IN HIS AVOWED VIEWS A
MOBS SPLENDIDLY HANDLED TOSSING WILDLY AND RHYTHMICALLY LIKE THE SEA THEN IS DELINEATED THE RISE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
MOB MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY WILL GO THROUGH FANATICAL AND PROVINCIAL WHIRLWINDS INTO GREAT NATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY A BOOK BY GERALD STANLEY LEE THAT HAS A SCORE OF FUTURE SCENARIOS IN IT A BOOK THAT MIGHT
A TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE VIRTUES I HIGHLY ESTEEM WAS LATELY PLEASED IN DISCOURSING ON THIS MATTER TO OFFER A REFINEMENT UPON MY SCHEME HE SAID THAT MANY GENTLEMEN OF THIS KINGDOM
NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE
THESE FRIENDS GIVE THE SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN MASS THEN AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING AS THE SPECIAL AGENTS TO EXPRESS IT THE SOLDIERS ARE IN BATTLE BY THE FORTUNES OF WAR
OTHERS WHO MIGHT HAVE IT AT MERRY MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AT WEDDINGS AND CHRISTENINGS I COMPUTE THAT DUBLIN WOULD TAKE OFF ANNUALLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CARCASSES
RAGGED GLOWERING STRIKERS AND GOSSIPING DICKERING PEOPLE IN THE MARKETPLACE ONLY GRIFFITH AND HIS CLOSE DISCIPLES CAN DO THESE AS WELL AS ALMOST ANY MANAGER CAN REPRODUCE THE OCEAN
TO FIGHT FOR THE PRETENDER IN SPAIN OR SELL THEMSELVES TO THE BARBADOES
TELLING GOOD BY TO THEIR KINDRED ON THE PIERS THEN THE DRAMA OF ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK THE WONDER OF THE STEERAGE PEOPLE POURING DOWN THEIR PROPER GANGWAY IS CONTRASTED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL
FOR THE CARCASS OF A GOOD FAT CHILD WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WILL MAKE FOUR DISHES OF EXCELLENT NUTRITIVE MEAT WHEN HE HATH ONLY SOME PARTICULAR FRIEND OR HIS OWN FAMILY TO DINE WITH HIM THUS THE SQUIRE WILL LEARN TO BE A GOOD LANDLORD
A VERY GREAT ADDITIONAL GRIEVANCE AND THEREFORE WHOEVER COULD FIND OUT A FAIR CHEAP AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING THESE CHILDREN
WHAT BECOMES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE AND SHERIDAN KNOWLES IN THE FILM OR BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE'S LEAR AND ANY ONE ELSE'S LEAR NO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE INTEREST LIES IN THE NEW OPENING
WILL BECOME SACRED IN EACH OTHER'S EYES IN PICTURES AND IN FACT A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS THEME ON OTHER PLANES
OF UTTERLY REJECTING THE MATERIALS AND INSTRUMENTS THAT PROMOTE FOREIGN LUXURY
IMPERSONATES THE ITALIAN IN A FILM OF THAT TITLE BY THOMAS H INCE AND G GARDENER SULLIVAN THE FIRST PART TAKEN OSTENSIBLY IN VENICE DELINEATES THE FESTIVAL SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGES
YET THE SEA OF HUMANITY IS DRAMATICALLY BLOOD BROTHER TO THE PACIFIC ATLANTIC OR MEDITERRANEAN
THAT THEY WILL FIRST ASK THE PARENTS OF THESE MORTALS WHETHER THEY WOULD NOT AT THIS DAY THINK IT A GREAT HAPPINESS TO HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR FOOD AT A YEAR OLD IN THE MANNER I PRESCRIBE
IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO
THAT IT WILL PREVENT THOSE VOLUNTARY ABORTIONS AND THAT HORRID PRACTICE OF WOMEN MURDERING THEIR BASTARD CHILDREN ALAS TOO FREQUENT AMONG US
FORMERLY DISABLED BY INCIDENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THAT DO NOT MATTER IN THE PICTURE THEATRE
IT IS OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT
FOR THIS KIND OF COMMODITY WILL NOT BEAR EXPORTATION AND FLESH BEING OF TOO TENDER A CONSISTENCE TO ADMIT A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT
NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE
SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE
WHICH OF THEM COULD BRING THE FATTEST CHILD TO THE MARKET MEN WOULD BECOME AS FOND OF THEIR WIVES DURING THE TIME OF THEIR PREGNANCY AS THEY ARE NOW OF THEIR MARES IN FOAL THEIR COWS IN CALF
AND CLARA WILLIAMS AS THE ITALIAN AND HIS SWEETHEART THEY OWE THE FORCE OF THEIR ACTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY EXPRESS EACH MASS OF HUMANITY IN TURN THEIR CHILD IS BORN IT DOES NOT FLOURISH
AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BREEDERS I AGAIN SUBTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO MISCARRY OR WHOSE CHILDREN DIE BY ACCIDENT OR DISEASE WITHIN THE YEAR
THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
MISTER LEE IS FAR FROM INFALLIBLE IN HIS REMEDIES FOR FACTORY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUT IN SENSITIVENESS TO THE FLOWING STREET OF HUMANITY HE IS INDEED A MAN
ONLY THE GIRL KNOWS HE WAS FIRST A FAILURE THE WOUNDED GENERAL HONORS HIM AS THE HERO ABOVE ALL NOW SHE IS RADIANT SHE CANNOT HELP BUT BE TRIUMPHANT
AND I HAVE BEEN DESIRED TO EMPLOY MY THOUGHTS WHAT COURSE MAY BE TAKEN TO EASE THE NATION OF SO GRIEVOUS AN INCUMBRANCE BUT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST PAIN UPON THAT MATTER
AND THAT IN HIS TIME THE BODY OF A PLUMP GIRL OF FIFTEEN WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR AN ATTEMPT TO POISON THE EMPEROR WAS SOLD TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S PRIME MINISTER OF STATE AND OTHER GREAT MANDARINS OF THE COURT
I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY A VERY KNOWING AMERICAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN LONDON THAT A YOUNG HEALTHY CHILD WELL NURSED IS AT A YEAR OLD A MOST DELICIOUS
AND THE WHOLE BODY SOCIAL OF THE VILLAGE HOW THE COSTUMES FLASH AND THE HANDKERCHIEFS WAVE AROUND HER
BUYING THE CHILDREN ALIVE AND DRESSING THEM HOT FROM THE KNIFE AS WE DO ROASTING PIGS A VERY WORTHY PERSON
WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN
THE BIRTH OF A NATION READ THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER ENTITLED THE ORCHESTRA CONVERSATION AND THE CENSORSHIP
ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY
NOTE IN ESPECIAL WHAT SHAW SAYS ABOUT NARRATIVE EPIC AND PARADISE LOST HE HAS IN MIND NO DOUBT THE POURING HOSTS OF DEMONS AND ANGELS THIS IS
I SHALL REITERATE THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE NECESSITY FOR RESTRAINT A ONE HOUR PROGRAMME IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE IF THE OBSERVER IS PLEASED HE WILL SIT IT THROUGH AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER HOUR
IN THE GLASS LATER
SACRIFICING THE POOR INNOCENT BABES I DOUBT MORE TO AVOID THE EXPENCE THAN THE SHAME WHICH WOULD MOVE TEARS AND PITY IN THE MOST SAVAGE AND INHUMAN BREAST
THIS I FREELY OWN AND TWAS INDEED ONE PRINCIPAL DESIGN IN OFFERING IT TO THE WORLD I DESIRE THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT I CALCULATE MY REMEDY FOR THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL KINGDOM OF IRELAND
OF TWENTY MINUTES EACH THESE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY PLEASE AT ALL ONE CAN SEE THEM AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT
FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE
FOR WE CAN NEITHER EMPLOY THEM IN HANDICRAFT OR AGRICULTURE WE NEITHER BUILD HOUSES I MEAN IN THE COUNTRY NOR CULTIVATE LAND THEY CAN VERY SELDOM PICK UP A LIVELIHOOD BY STEALING TILL THEY ARRIVE AT SIX YEARS OLD
STAY AT HOME ON PURPOSE WITH A DESIGN TO DELIVER THE KINGDOM TO THE PRETENDER HOPING TO TAKE THEIR ADVANTAGE BY THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY GOOD PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE CHOSEN RATHER TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY THAN STAY AT HOME AND PAY TITHES
FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE
BESIDES THE PROFIT OF A NEW DISH INTRODUCED TO THE TABLES OF ALL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE IN THE KINGDOM WHO HAVE ANY REFINEMENT IN TASTE AND THE MONEY WILL CIRCULATE AMONG OUR SELVES THE GOODS BEING ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE
WHICH ROASTED WHOLE WILL MAKE A CONSIDERABLE FIGURE AT A LORD MAYOR'S FEAST
THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED
THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PERSONAL INTEREST IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROMOTE THIS NECESSARY WORK HAVING NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN THE PUBLICK GOOD OF MY COUNTRY BY ADVANCING OUR TRADE PROVIDING FOR INFANTS RELIEVING THE POOR
TO BRING US THESE PANORAMIC DRAMA ELEMENTS BY THE LAW OF COMPENSATION WHILE THE MOTION PICTURE IS SHALLOW IN SHOWING PRIVATE PASSION IT IS POWERFUL IN CONVEYING THE PASSIONS OF MASSES OF MEN BERNARD SHAW
IT TURNS THE CROWD INTO A MOB THAT IS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON'S POISONOUS HATRED OF THE NEGRO GRIFFITH IS A CHAMELEON IN INTERPRETING HIS AUTHORS WHEREVER THE SCENARIO SHOWS TRACES OF THE CLANSMAN
I HAVE RECKONED UPON A MEDIUM THAT A CHILD JUST BORN WILL WEIGH TWELVE POUNDS AND IN A SOLAR YEAR IF TOLERABLY NURSED ENCREASETH TO TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS
THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN
IT REPRESENTS IN AN ACUTER WAY ANOTHER PHASE OF THE SAME CHILD STRUGGLE WITH THE HEAT THAT THE GAMINS INDICATE IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE WATER CART THEN A DEEPER MATTER
THERE IS NOT A GOOD FILM IN THE WORLD BUT IS THE BETTER FOR BEING SEEN IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION TO ITSELF SIX REEL PROGRAMMES ARE A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH THE BEST OF THE OLD ONE REEL BIOGRAPHS OF GRIFFITH
WILL BE PLEASED MATURELY TO CONSIDER TWO POINTS FIRST AS THINGS NOW STAND HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FOOD
THEY CANNOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY PINE AWAY FROM WANT OF NOURISHMENT
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT
WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART
THEIR CORN AND CATTLE BEING ALREADY SEIZED AND MONEY A THING UNKNOWN THIRDLY WHEREAS THE MAINTAINANCE OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT LESS THAN TEN SHILLINGS A PIECE PER ANNUM
BUT THIS AND MANY OTHERS I OMIT BEING STUDIOUS OF BREVITY SUPPOSING THAT ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THIS CITY WOULD BE CONSTANT CUSTOMERS FOR INFANTS FLESH BESIDES
AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE TO AN EPISCOPAL CURATE SECONDLY THE POORER TENANTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE OF THEIR OWN WHICH BY LAW
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POPISH INFANTS IS AT LEAST THREE TO ONE IN THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE ONE OTHER COLLATERAL ADVANTAGE BY LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS AMONG US
I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD
THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES
IMPRACTICABLE ON THE STAGE PARADISE LOST WOULD MAKE A FAR BETTER FILM THAN IBSEN'S JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN THOUGH BORKMAN IS A DRAMATIC MASTERPIECE AND MILTON COULD NOT WRITE AN EFFECTIVE PLAY
BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA
BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT IT IS A WONDER IN ITS GRIFFITH SECTIONS IN ITS HANDLING OF MASSES OF MEN IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE NOTABLE THE OLD ONE REEL BATTLE FILM DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER
VANITY IDLENESS AND GAMING IN OUR WOMEN OF INTRODUCING A VEIN OF PARSIMONY PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE OF LEARNING TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY WHEREIN WE DIFFER EVEN FROM LAPLANDERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF
AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE
WHICH SHALL BE FOUND EQUALLY INNOCENT CHEAP EASY AND EFFECTUAL BUT BEFORE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND SHALL BE ADVANCED IN CONTRADICTION TO MY SCHEME AND OFFERING A BETTER I DESIRE THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS
THESE MOTHERS INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO WORK FOR THEIR HONEST LIVELIHOOD ARE FORCED TO EMPLOY ALL THEIR TIME IN STROLING TO BEG SUSTENANCE FOR THEIR HELPLESS INFANTS WHO
CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
I RECOMMEND THEIR WORKS TO HIM AS A BETTER BASIS FOR FUTURE SOUTHERN SCENARIOS THE BIRTH OF A NATION HAS BEEN VERY PROPERLY DENOUNCED FOR ITS SIMON LEGREE QUALITIES BY FRANCIS HACKETT JANE ADDAMS AND OTHERS
THEY HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO PERFORM IT AND THUS THE COUNTRY AND THEMSELVES ARE HAPPILY DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS TO COME I HAVE TOO LONG DIGRESSED AND THEREFORE SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT
HYDROPHOBIA IN THE LATTER END OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN UNCONSCIOUSLY MISTER DIXON HAS DONE HIS BEST TO PROVE THAT LEGREE WAS NOT A FICTITIOUS CHARACTER
A MERRY GRAPE HARVEST THEN THE
IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES AS A STANDARD ONE REEL FILMS ARE UNFORTUNATE IN THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER TO SEE A FAVORITE THE STUDENT MUST WAIT
AND IN GONDOLAS IT GIVES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN CROWD HAPPINESS
STOP TO ANALYZE WHAT THEY STOOD FOR
LISTEN TO THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE DIVISIONS OF HIS BOOK CROWDS AND MACHINES LETTING THE CROWDS BE GOOD LETTING THE CROWDS BE BEAUTIFUL CROWDS AND HEROES
I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
GOES DOWN BEFORE THE ASSASSIN IT IS A MASTER SCENE HE FALLS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A THOUSAND HIGH AND NOBLE CROWD ASPIRATIONS THE MIMIC AUDIENCE IN THE RESTORED FORD'S THEATRE RISES IN PANIC
TO CONTINUE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN PRIVATE PASSION IN THE THEATRE AND CROWD PASSION IN THE PHOTOPLAY LET US TURN TO SHAW AGAIN CONSIDER HIS ILLUSTRATION OF IAGO OTHELLO AND LEAR THESE PARTS AS HE IMPLIES
AND FOR THE TIME BREAKS HER HEART HE GOES FORTH A FUGITIVE NOT ONLY FROM BATTLE BUT FROM HER TERRIBLE GIRLISH ANGER BUT LATER HE RALLIES HE
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE I AM SURE BUT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN ASLEEP IN BED WHEN I AM UP MADDENS ME IT SEEMS TO ME SO SHOCKING TO SEE THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A MAN'S LIFE THE PRICELESS MOMENTS THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HIM AGAIN
WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE
TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
LOOK HERE HIS HOOF IS CUT ALL TO PIECES HE MIGHT WELL COME DOWN POOR FELLOW I TELL YOU WHAT NED I'M AFRAID IT HASN'T BEEN ALL RIGHT WITH REUBEN JUST THINK OF HIS RIDING A HORSE OVER THESE STONES WITHOUT A SHOE
SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS
OH DO BE SENSIBLE CRIED DAB DAB WHERE WOULD YOU GET ALL THE WOOD AND THE NAILS TO MAKE ONE WITH AND BESIDES WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON WE SHALL BE POORER THAN EVER WHEN WE GET BACK CHEE CHEE'S PERFECTLY RIGHT
BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE
IT WAS MISSUS POPPETS THAT WOKE ME UP NEXT MORNING SHE SAID
HE SNEAKED THE CIGARETTE THAT I HAD CAREFULLY ROLLED UP FOR MYSELF AND WENT THEN HARRIS AND I HAVING FINISHED UP THE FEW THINGS LEFT ON THE TABLE
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
IT WAS PROMPTLY CONCLUDED BY OUR STREET THAT BIGGS'S BOY FOR THAT PERIOD WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND HAD HE NOT BEEN ABLE
AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN
THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS STARTED OUT TO GO BACK TO THE SEASHORE
NOMINAL ALLEGIANCE NONCHALANT MANNER NON COMMITTAL WAY NONDESCRIPT GARB NONSENSE RHYMES
UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
AND PACKING OURSELVES AND OUR BELONGINGS INTO IT AND SHOOTING OUT A COUPLE OF MONTMORENCY'S FRIENDS WHO HAD EVIDENTLY SWORN NEVER TO FORSAKE HIM WE DROVE AWAY AMIDST THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD BIGGS'S BOY SHYING A CARROT AFTER US FOR LUCK
IT WOULD COMMENCE TO RAIN HARD AND A BITTERLY COLD WIND WOULD SPRING UP AND BOTH WOULD KEEP ON STEADILY FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WE WOULD COME HOME WITH COLDS AND RHEUMATISM ALL OVER US AND GO TO BED
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ON THIS LINE WE SAID WHAT YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SLIP OFF QUIETLY AND GO TO KINGSTON WELL I DON'T KNOW GENTS REPLIED THE NOBLE FELLOW
I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION
AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER
NAUTICAL VENTURE NEAT REFUTATION NEBULOUS UNCERTAINTY
NOONDAY SPLENDOR NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS NOTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE NOTEWORTHY FRIENDSHIP NOTICEABLY BEGRIMED
BIGGS'S BOY WAS THE FIRST TO COME ROUND BIGGS IS OUR GREENGROCER AND HIS CHIEF TALENT LIES IN SECURING THE SERVICES
THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
WHEN THE PACKING WAS FINISHED AND EVERYTHING WAS READY TO START THE MONKEYS GAVE A GRAND PARTY FOR THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS OF THE JUNGLE CAME AND THEY HAD PINEAPPLES AND MANGOES AND HONEY
THIS DOCTOR SAID CHEE CHEE IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE RAREST ANIMAL OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES THE ONLY TWO HEADED BEAST IN THE WORLD TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU
AND WE CHUCKLED TO THINK HOW WET THEY WERE GOING TO GET AND CAME BACK AND STIRRED THE FIRE AND GOT OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED OUR SPECIMENS OF SEAWEED AND COCKLE SHELLS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH THE SUN POURING INTO THE ROOM THE HEAT BECAME QUITE OPPRESSIVE
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
FOR HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS IGNORANT AS HE WAS CONCEITED AND THEN INSTEAD OF EXERCISE OR CHANGE OF FOOD I HAD TO TAKE HORSE BALLS AND DRAUGHTS WHICH BESIDE THE NUISANCE OF HAVING THEM POURED DOWN MY THROAT
HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
AND EVEN TO THIS DAY IN THE HEART OF THE JUNGLE THAT STONE STILL IS THERE AND MONKEY MOTHERS PASSING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH THEIR FAMILIES STILL POINT DOWN AT IT FROM THE BRANCHES
WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
AS THE BEEF COULD WAIT GEORGE GOT HOLD OF THE PAPER AND READ US OUT THE BOATING FATALITIES
A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
SHORT NOTICE SOON PAST THE FINE WEATHER NEVER CAME THAT SUMMER I EXPECT THAT MACHINE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING THEN THERE ARE THOSE NEW STYLE OF BAROMETERS
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
AND REDUCE IT TO FAHRENHEIT AND EVEN THEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHO WANTS TO BE FORETOLD THE WEATHER
LORD SAVE US CRIED THE DUCK HOW DOES IT MAKE UP ITS MIND IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME AS THOUGH IT HAD ANY SAID JIP THE DOG
TOUCHING HIS HAT AT EVERY WORD
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
AND I HAVE JUST EATEN MANY FRUITS AND MUCH HONEY BUT I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SAD AT LEAVING YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY BECAUSE I HAVE THINGS TO DO IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN I MUST GO
AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
TOOK UP AN INDEPENDENT POSITION ON THE CURB THEY AIN'T A GOING TO STARVE ARE THEY SAID THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP AH YOU'D WANT TO TAKE A THING OR TWO WITH YOU RETORTED THE BLUE POSTS
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
AND A LOVELY NIGHT AFTER IT THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD READ THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WARM FINE TO SET FAIR DAY MUCH HEAT AND WE WOULD DRESS OURSELVES IN FLIMSY THINGS
THE PUSHMI PULLYU HEARD THEM COMING AND HE TRIED HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THE RING OF MONKEYS BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED
TO THE ABYSSINIAN GAZELLES AND THE ASIATIC CHAMOIS ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE MY FATHER'S GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE UNICORNS MOST INTERESTING MURMURED THE DOCTOR
I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
I THINK THE DRAIN DOES SOMETIMES SEND BACK A SMELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG SIR
AND SLEPT IN SPITE OF THE PAIN THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FARRIER HAD EXAMINED MY WOUNDS HE SAID HE HOPED THE JOINT WAS NOT INJURED AND IF SO I SHOULD NOT BE SPOILED FOR WORK
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE HE GOES VERY FUMBLE FOOTED I AM SOMETIMES AFRAID HE WILL STUMBLE YES SIR SAID ALFRED I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME MYSELF WHEN I HAVE EXERCISED HIM
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM
REALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD YES I'LL GO SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU WHO SAW AT ONCE FROM THE DOCTOR'S FACE THAT HE WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO THE ANIMALS HERE
WHO WAS PACKING THE TRUNK SAID COME IN AND CHEE CHEE VERY PROUDLY TOOK THE ANIMAL INSIDE AND SHOWED HIM TO THE DOCTOR WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT ASKED JOHN DOLITTLE GAZING AT THE STRANGE CREATURE
THERE WAS THE GLADSTONE AND THE SMALL HAND BAG AND THE TWO HAMPERS AND A LARGE ROLL OF RUGS AND SOME FOUR OR FIVE OVERCOATS AND MACINTOSHES AND A FEW UMBRELLAS
THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
SAID THE MAN RIGHT IT IS WE ANSWERED AND WITH HARRIS AT THE SCULLS AND I AT THE TILLER LINES AND MONTMORENCY UNHAPPY AND DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS IN THE PROW
BUT A HEAD AT EACH END AND SHARP HORNS ON EACH HEAD THEY WERE VERY SHY AND TERRIBLY HARD TO CATCH THE BLACK MEN GET MOST OF THEIR ANIMALS BY SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM WHILE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING
THE GROCER'S BOY CAME ACROSS AND TOOK UP A POSITION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STEP THEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP STOPPED AND JOINED BIGGS'S BOY WHILE THE EMPTY CAN SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE BLUE POSTS
BY OUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER REPORT OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HEAVY SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DAY IT WOULD SAY ON MONDAY AND SO WE WOULD GIVE UP OUR PICNIC AND STOP INDOORS ALL DAY WAITING FOR THE RAIN
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GET UP AT SIX SO I DID I ANSWERED
AND MY SHOE WAS PICKED UP AMONG THE STONES SO THAT THE CASE WAS QUITE PLAIN TO THEM AND I WAS CLEARED OF ALL BLAME EVERYBODY PITIED SUSAN SHE WAS NEARLY OUT OF HER MIND
NOBODY AT WATERLOO EVER DOES KNOW WHERE A TRAIN IS GOING TO START FROM OR WHERE A TRAIN WHEN IT DOES START IS GOING TO OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE PORTER WHO TOOK OUR THINGS THOUGHT IT WOULD GO FROM NUMBER TWO PLATFORM
AND THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE CORPSE'S BROTHER AT LAST AN EMPTY CAB TURNED UP IT IS A STREET WHERE AS A RULE AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT WANTED EMPTY CABS PASS AT THE RATE OF THREE A MINUTE AND HANG ABOUT AND GET IN YOUR WAY

SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE

USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER
I TAPPED IT AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING AND IT WENT UP STILL HIGHER AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN FASTER THAN EVER ON WEDNESDAY I WENT AND HIT IT AGAIN AND THE POINTER WENT ROUND TOWARDS SET FAIR VERY DRY AND
EXCUSE ME SURELY YOU ARE RELATED TO THE DEER FAMILY ARE YOU NOT YES
AND AFTER THEY HAD GONE A GOOD MANY MILES ONE OF THEM FOUND PECULIAR FOOTPRINTS NEAR THE EDGE OF A RIVER AND THEY KNEW THAT A PUSHMI PULLYU MUST BE VERY NEAR THAT SPOT THEN
HE SAID HE WOULD COME WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE DOCTOR WAS FIRST SO THE MONKEYS TRAVELED BACK WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSE OF GRASS WAS THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DUCK
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
AND HARRIS LANDED HIM ONE WITH A SLIPPER AND I SHOUTED IN HIS EAR AND HE AWOKE WASERMARRER HE OBSERVED SITTING UP GET UP YOU FAT HEADED CHUNK ROARED HARRIS
AND HARRIS AND I BEGAN TO FEEL RATHER ASHAMED OF IT THOUGH WHY WE SHOULD BE I CAN'T SEE NO CAB CAME BY BUT THE STREET BOYS DID AND GOT INTERESTED IN THE SHOW APPARENTLY AND STOPPED
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
OR THE TEN A M EXPRESS FOR THE ISLE OF WIGHT OR SOMEWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE SHOULD ALL KNOW WHEN WE GOT THERE WE SLIPPED HALF A CROWN INTO HIS HAND
IT WILL BREAK ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SIR AH
WELL NO SIR I'M AFRAID IT'S SETTLED DOWN FOR THE DAY HE REPLIES SHAKING HIS HEAD STUPID OLD FOOL WE MUTTER WHAT'S HE KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF HIS PORTENT PROVES CORRECT
N NAIVE MANNER NAKED EYE NAMELESS FEAR NARCOTIC EFFECT NARROWING AXIOMS
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
WHEN THE DOCTOR STOPPED SPEAKING AND SAT DOWN ALL THE MONKEYS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS A LONG TIME AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET IT BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS AMONG OUR PEOPLE THAT HE SAT AND ATE WITH US HERE UNDER THE TREES
WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
IN ALL WEATHERS FOR PUSHMI PULLYUS NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD EVER BEEN CAUGHT EVEN THEN YEARS AGO HE WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WITH TWO HEADS WELL
WE KNOW THAT IT IS BIGGS'S LATEST
NOCTURNAL SCENE NODDING APPROVAL NOISELESS REVERIE NOISY PLATITUDES NOMADIC LIFE
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
TAKE THE FUNNY LOOKING THING ALONG DO WELL PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MURMURED THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE A NICE NEW KIND OF PET BUT DOES THE ER
HOW IT ENDED IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET SOMETIMES THE SOUND DIED AWAY THEN IT GREW CLEARER AGAIN
IT RISES OR FALLS FOR RAIN AND FINE WITH MUCH OR LESS WIND AND ONE END IS NLY
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
ORGANIC ASSIMILATION ORIENTAL SPICERY ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED OSCILLATORY MOVEMENT OSTENSIBLE OCCUPATION
WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
NOTORIOUSLY PROFLIGATE NOVEL
BUT SHE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID WHAT WAS GOING ON AND STOOD AS STILL AS A STONE I NOTICED THAT BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT IN STANDING
MUCH HEAT UNTIL IT WAS STOPPED BY THE PEG AND COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER IT TRIED ITS BEST
WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD
OUTSTRETCHING SYMPATHIES OUTWARD POMP OUTWORN CREED OVERBEARING STYLE OVERESTIMATED IMPORTANCE
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THEM SINCE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTACHED MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THAT ALIBI MYSELF BIGGS'S BOY AS I HAVE SAID CAME ROUND THE CORNER HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A GREAT HURRY WHEN HE FIRST DAWNED UPON THE VISION
THE DAUGHTER WAS FOURTEEN HER HAIR THICK AND DARK LIKE HER MOTHER'S FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS IN FINE PROFUSION AND SHE HAD THE SAME KINDLY EXPRESSION AND SEDATE UNTROUBLED EYES
THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE CIRCLE IS EVER TRAVELLED ANEW SOMETIMES A MAN SURVIVES A CONSIDERABLE TIME
BUT NOW TO BE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE IS ABSURD
HE WAS A FAMOUS POET IN HIS DAY AND THE WORLD RECOGNISED HIS GENIUS WITH A UNANIMITY WHICH THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF MODERN LIFE HAS RENDERED INFREQUENT HE HAD LEARNT HIS CRAFT AT THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDER POPE AND
CAN HARDLY BE SUPERFLUOUS WHAT WOULD WE NOT GIVE FOR THE REMINISCENCES OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH EL GRECO AS I WAS WITH STRICKLAND
BUT THE ODES OF KEATS AND OF WORDSWORTH A POEM OR TWO BY COLERIDGE A FEW MORE BY SHELLEY DISCOVERED VAST REALMS OF THE SPIRIT THAT NONE HAD EXPLORED BEFORE MISTER CRABBE WAS AS DEAD AS MUTTON BUT
THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WILL MOVE THE YOUNGER GENERATION CONSCIOUS OF STRENGTH AND TUMULTUOUS HAVE DONE WITH KNOCKING AT THE DOOR THEY HAVE BURST IN AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN OUR SEATS
I FELT THEY EXPECTED ME TO SAY CLEVER THINGS AND I NEVER COULD THINK OF ANY TILL AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER I TRIED TO CONCEAL MY EMBARRASSMENT BY HANDING ROUND CUPS OF TEA AND RATHER ILL CUT BREAD AND BUTTER
IT WAS AT HER HOUSE ONE DAY THAT I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND'S WIFE MISS WATERFORD WAS GIVING A TEA PARTY AND HER SMALL ROOM WAS MORE THAN USUALLY FULL EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE TALKING AND I SITTING IN SILENCE FELT AWKWARD BUT
BUT I SEEK REFUGE IN NO SUCH EXCUSES I FORGET WHO IT WAS THAT RECOMMENDED MEN FOR THEIR SOUL'S GOOD TO DO EACH DAY TWO THINGS THEY DISLIKED
RICHARD TWINING BUBBLED OVER WITH QUAINT ABSURDITIES AND GEORGE ROAD CONSCIOUS THAT HE NEED NOT EXHIBIT A BRILLIANCY WHICH WAS ALMOST A BY WORD OPENED HIS MOUTH ONLY TO PUT FOOD INTO IT
THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
MISSUS JAY AWARE THAT IMPROPRIETY IS THE SOUL OF WIT MADE OBSERVATIONS IN TONES HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER THAT
SHE HAD LED A VERY QUIET YOUTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE BOOKS THAT CAME DOWN FROM MUDIE'S LIBRARY BROUGHT WITH THEM NOT ONLY THEIR OWN ROMANCE BUT THE ROMANCE OF LONDON SHE HAD A REAL PASSION FOR READING RARE IN HER KIND
WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
I WAS LED UP TO MISSUS STRICKLAND AND FOR TEN MINUTES WE TALKED TOGETHER I NOTICED NOTHING ABOUT HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE SHE HAD A FLAT IN WESTMINSTER OVERLOOKING THE UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL AND
THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN
WHEN WE HAD DONE DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE LATEST BOOK IT WAS NATURAL TO WONDER HOW MANY COPIES HAD BEEN SOLD WHAT ADVANCE THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKELY TO MAKE OUT OF IT
DURING THE SUMMER I MET MISSUS STRICKLAND NOT INFREQUENTLY I WENT NOW AND THEN TO PLEASANT LITTLE LUNCHEONS AT HER FLAT AND TO RATHER MORE FORMIDABLE TEA PARTIES WE TOOK A FANCY TO ONE ANOTHER
I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID
AND DULL WHEN WE LEFT I WALKED AWAY WITH MISS WATERFORD AND THE FINE DAY AND HER NEW HAT PERSUADED US TO SAUNTER THROUGH THE PARK
THERE AS IS NOTORIOUS HE SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND THERE I CAME ACROSS PERSONS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH HIM I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO THROW LIGHT ON JUST THAT PART OF HIS TRAGIC CAREER
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND WAS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER AND YOU FELT SURE THAT SHE WAS AN ADMIRABLE MOTHER THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF HER SON AND DAUGHTER THE SON HIS NAME WAS ROBERT
MISSUS STRICKLAND DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT SHE HAD A PLEASANT GIFT FOR KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GENERAL AND WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE
TURNING TO HIM GAILY SHE ATTEMPTED A SMALL JEST I ASKED HIM TO SHOW HIM THAT I REALLY HAD A HUSBAND I THINK HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IT
THE AIR IS NOISY WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF THEIR ELDERS SOME BY IMITATING THE ANTICS OF YOUTH STRIVE TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR DAY IS NOT YET OVER
SHE MANAGED HER SURROUNDINGS WITH ELEGANCE HER FLAT WAS ALWAYS NEAT AND CHEERFUL GAY WITH FLOWERS AND THE CHINTZES IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SEVERE DESIGN WERE BRIGHT AND PRETTY THE MEALS IN THE ARTISTIC LITTLE DINING ROOM WERE PLEASANT
THESE PERSONS HAD ACCEPTED WHY TO AVOID THE TEDIUM OF DINING TETE A TETE TO GIVE THEIR SERVANTS A REST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON TO REFUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE OWED A DINNER
THESE A MAN CAN DO WITHOUT HE HAD NO ECCENTRICITY EVEN
BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER SO CRUDE A PROMISCUITY AS SEEMS TO BE PRACTISED IN THE PRESENT DAY WE DID NOT THINK IT HYPOCRITICAL TO DRAW OVER OUR VAGARIES THE CURTAIN OF A DECENT SILENCE
THE MORAL I DRAW IS THAT THE WRITER SHOULD SEEK HIS REWARD IN THE PLEASURE OF HIS WORK AND IN RELEASE FROM THE BURDEN OF HIS THOUGHT AND INDIFFERENT TO AUGHT ELSE CARE NOTHING FOR PRAISE OR CENSURE
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH I'LL ASK YOU TO DINE WITH US QUIETLY SOME TIME BUT MIND YOU COME AT YOUR OWN RISK DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU HAVE A VERY DULL EVENING
ROSE WATERFORD HAD A BLISTERING TONGUE NO ONE COULD SAY SUCH BITTER THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND NO ONE COULD DO MORE CHARMING ONES THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I LIKED IN MISSUS STRICKLAND
IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME
NOT GOOD LOOKING AND YET NOT UGLY FOR HIS FEATURES WERE RATHER GOOD
WHICH TENDED TO HIGH HEELS AND PARIS FROCKS WORE A NEW HAT
PERHAPS HER NAIVETE WAS HER GREATEST CHARM YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AT ALL LITERARY SHE SAID HE'S A PERFECT PHILISTINE
AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WAS IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH ME EXAMINED STRICKLAND AT MY EASE HE WAS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD IMAGINED HIM SLENDER AND OF INSIGNIFICANT APPEARANCE
THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE
SICK WITH APPREHENSION WAS USHERED INTO AN AIRLESS ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS CELEBRATED PERSON AFTER THAT ONE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY SAID ABOUT MY BOOK MADE ME EXCESSIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INFLUENCE ON HER CONVICTIONS IS THERE A MISTER STRICKLAND I ASKED OH YES HE'S SOMETHING IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE'S A STOCKBROKER HE'S VERY DULL ARE THEY GOOD FRIENDS
CHAPTER FOUR NO ONE WAS KINDER TO ME AT THAT TIME THAN ROSE WATERFORD SHE COMBINED A MASCULINE INTELLIGENCE WITH A FEMININE PERVERSITY AND THE NOVELS SHE WROTE WERE ORIGINAL AND DISCONCERTING
THE FATE WHICH AWAITS THEM WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT ANY BOOK WILL MAKE ITS WAY AMONG THAT MULTITUDE AND THE SUCCESSFUL BOOKS ARE BUT THE SUCCESSES OF A SEASON HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PAINS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN AT
MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS
I HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF LARGE UNBENDING WOMEN WITH GREAT NOSES AND RAPACIOUS EYES WHO WORE THEIR CLOTHES AS THOUGH THEY WERE ARMOUR AND OF LITTLE MOUSE LIKE SPINSTERS WITH SOFT VOICES AND A SHREWD GLANCE
THE GREEN CURTAINS WITH THEIR PEACOCK DESIGN HUNG IN STRAIGHT LINES AND THE GREEN CARPET
WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION
ROSE WATERFORD CAST DOWN HER EYES DEMURELY TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER REPLY SHE GIVES LUNCHEON PARTIES
AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE
SO THAT THEY MAY EXERCISE THEIR DEXTERITY IT GUSHES FORTH LIKE AN OIL WELL AND THE SYMPATHETIC POUR OUT THEIR SYMPATHY WITH AN ABANDON THAT IS SOMETIMES EMBARRASSING TO THEIR VICTIMS
I HAVE NEVER FAILED TO READ THE LITERARY SUPPLEMENT OF THE TIMES IT IS A SALUTARY DISCIPLINE TO CONSIDER THE VAST NUMBER OF BOOKS THAT ARE WRITTEN THE FAIR HOPES WITH WHICH THEIR AUTHORS SEE THEM PUBLISHED AND
STRICKLAND GAVE THE POLITE LITTLE LAUGH WITH WHICH PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE A FACETIOUSNESS IN WHICH THEY SEE NOTHING FUNNY BUT DID NOT SPEAK NEW ARRIVALS CLAIMED MY HOST'S ATTENTION AND I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
I LIVED NEAR VICTORIA STATION AND I RECALL LONG EXCURSIONS BY BUS TO THE HOSPITABLE HOUSES OF THE LITERARY IN MY TIMIDITY I WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE STREET WHILE I SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO RING THE BELL AND THEN
TO MY MIND THEY KNOW TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT STOMACH THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THEY SLAP ME ON THE BACK OR THE EMOTION WITH WHICH THEY HURL THEMSELVES ON MY BOSOM
HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER
WITH JUST SUCH SCORN AND THEY FORESEE THAT THESE BRAVE TORCH BEARERS WILL PRESENTLY YIELD THEIR PLACE ALSO THERE IS NO LAST WORD
AND THEIR DREAMS A TRIFLE DULL I DO NOT LIKE THEM I AM ON THE SHELF I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS BUT
THE MEN WERE SELDOM ECCENTRIC IN APPEARANCE THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS LITTLE LIKE AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE
THE WISER GO THEIR WAY WITH A DECENT GRACE IN THEIR CHASTENED SMILE IS AN INDULGENT MOCKERY THEY REMEMBER THAT THEY TOO TROD DOWN A SATED GENERATION WITH JUST SUCH CLAMOR AND
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEVER SETTLED DOWN SO COMFORTABLY AS WHEN IT TURNED TO THE DETAILS OF THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ART WE PRACTISED
WHEN I ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE IN MY FEAR OF BEING TOO EARLY I HAD WALKED THREE TIMES ROUND THE CATHEDRAL I FOUND THE PARTY ALREADY COMPLETE MISS WATERFORD WAS THERE AND MISSUS JAY RICHARD TWINING AND GEORGE ROAD WE WERE ALL WRITERS
SHE HESITATED A LITTLE HER EYES GREW TENDER HE DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE A GENIUS HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT HE'S AWFULLY GOOD AND KIND
WE TALKED ABOUT A HUNDRED THINGS MISS WATERFORD TORN BETWEEN THE AESTHETICISM OF HER EARLY YOUTH WHEN SHE USED TO GO TO PARTIES IN SAGE GREEN HOLDING A DAFFODIL AND THE FLIPPANCY OF HER MATURER YEARS
AND I SAW HIM NOT INFREQUENTLY DURING THE DIFFICULT YEARS HE SPENT IN PARIS BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHOULD EVER HAVE SET DOWN MY RECOLLECTIONS IF THE HAZARDS OF THE WAR HAD NOT TAKEN ME TO TAHITI
IT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE FURNITURE BUT I SUPPOSE THE HOSTESS TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE FURNITURE OF HER FRIENDS WHEN IN TURN SHE VISITED THEM SOME OF THEM WERE DRESSED FASHIONABLY
OF EDITORS AND THE SORT OF CONTRIBUTIONS THEY WELCOMED HOW MUCH THEY PAID A THOUSAND AND WHETHER THEY PAID PROMPTLY OR OTHERWISE
THE ARTIST HAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT HIS FRIENDS OFFER NOT ONLY THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR CHARACTER TO HIS SATIRE BUT ALSO THEIR WORK
I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT
NEVER PREVENTED AN EDITOR FROM TAKING YOUR STUFF
IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD BEEN INVITED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE PARTY WAS PORTENTOUS THE WOMEN WERE TOO NICE TO BE WELL DRESSED AND TOO SURE OF THEIR POSITION TO BE AMUSING
WAS A BOY OF SIXTEEN AT RUGBY
THE WAR CRY SOUNDS HOLLOW IN THEIR MOUTH THEY ARE LIKE POOR WANTONS ATTEMPTING WITH PENCIL PAINT AND POWDER WITH SHRILL GAIETY TO RECOVER THE ILLUSION OF THEIR SPRING
THE VENUE IS DIFFERENT CHELSEA AND BLOOMSBURY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF HAMPSTEAD NOTTING HILL GATE AND HIGH STREET KENSINGTON
I WAS VERY YOUNG AND PERHAPS SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF GUIDING MY VIRGIN STEPS ON THE HARD ROAD OF LETTERS WHILE FOR ME IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD GO TO WITH MY SMALL TROUBLES CERTAIN OF AN ATTENTIVE EAR AND REASONABLE COUNSEL
THE MORE OBVIOUS FORMS OF PRETENTIOUSNESS
I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND FELT A CERTAIN EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT HIM HE WAS SCARCELY A CREDIT TO A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF A POSITION IN THE WORLD OF ART AND LETTERS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NO SOCIAL GIFTS BUT
THEN WE WOULD SPEAK OF THIS PUBLISHER AND OF THAT COMPARING THE GENEROSITY OF ONE WITH THE MEANNESS OF ANOTHER WE WOULD ARGUE WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO GO TO ONE WHO GAVE HANDSOME ROYALTIES
FAILURE OR SUCCESS NOW THE WAR HAS COME
SHE SAW THEM DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY SEEMED HERSELF TO LIVE A LARGER LIFE BECAUSE SHE ENTERTAINED THEM
FROM AN ERA IN WHICH HE HAD HIS PLACE INTO ONE WHICH IS STRANGE TO HIM AND THEN THE CURIOUS ARE OFFERED ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR SPECTACLES IN THE HUMAN COMEDY WHO NOW FOR EXAMPLE THINKS OF GEORGE CRABBE
DID YOU THINK THE FOOD WAS GOOD I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTED WRITERS SHE MUST FEED THEM WELL ADMIRABLE ADVICE I ANSWERED BUT WHY DOES SHE WANT THEM MISS WATERFORD SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS SHE FINDS THEM AMUSING
BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL CONVERSATION EACH ONE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT DURING THE SOUP FISH AND ENTREE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE LEFT DURING THE ROAST SWEET AND SAVOURY
I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING
THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO
PERHAPS HE DID NOT TALK VERY MUCH AND I FANCIED THERE WAS TOWARDS THE END A LOOK OF FATIGUE IN THE FACES OF THE WOMEN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEY WERE FINDING HIM HEAVY
HER SKIN WAS RATHER SALLOW HER DARK HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN OF THE THREE WHOSE FACE WAS FREE OF MAKE UP AND BY CONTRAST WITH THE OTHERS SHE SEEMED SIMPLE AND UNAFFECTED
BECAUSE WE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD WE FELT FRIENDLY DISPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ARMY AND NAVY STORES ARE A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN ALL WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE RIVER AND SAINT JAMES'S PARK
LEAFY TREES SUGGESTED THE INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM MORRIS THERE WAS BLUE DELFT ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AT THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED DINING ROOMS IN LONDON DECORATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER IT WAS CHASTE ARTISTIC
THE EPIGRAM NOT YET A MECHANICAL APPLIANCE BY WHICH THE DULL MAY ACHIEVE A SEMBLANCE OF WIT GAVE SPRIGHTLINESS TO THE SMALL TALK OF THE URBANE IT IS SAD THAT I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING OF ALL THIS SCINTILLATION
IF THE NOVELS THAT DESCRIBE ITS PRESENT SINGULARITIES ARE ACCURATE
IF YOU WILL COME I SHALL BE UNCOMMONLY GRATEFUL AND YOU AND I CAN HAVE A LITTLE CHAT BY OURSELVES IT WAS ONLY NEIGHBOURLY TO ACCEPT WHEN MISSUS STRICKLAND INTRODUCED ME TO HER HUSBAND HE GAVE ME A RATHER INDIFFERENT HAND TO SHAKE
THE NEW EVANGEL WAS OLD WHEN NINEVEH REARED HER GREATNESS TO THE SKY
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
MISSUS STRICKLAND ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS AND A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MY ENGAGEMENTS WERE FEW AND I WAS GLAD TO ACCEPT
WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED WAITING FOR DINNER TO BE ANNOUNCED I REFLECTED WHILE I CHATTED WITH THE WOMAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE IN THAT CIVILISED MAN PRACTISES A STRANGE INGENUITY
NEVER FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT OF REGULATING HER OWN CONDUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM THEIR MORAL ECCENTRICITIES LIKE THEIR ODDITIES OF DRESS THEIR WILD THEORIES AND PARADOXES WERE AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH AMUSED HER
I'M VERY FOND OF HIM SHE SMILED TO COVER HER SHYNESS AND I FANCIED SHE HAD A FEAR THAT I WOULD MAKE THE SORT OF GIBE THAT SUCH A CONFESSION COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO ELICIT FROM ROSE WATERFORD
BUT WHEN AT LAST I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND IT WAS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO NO MORE THAN JUST MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORNING MISSUS STRICKLAND SENT ME ROUND A NOTE TO SAY THAT SHE WAS GIVING A DINNER PARTY THAT EVENING
HAS ALREADY PUBLISHED NUMBERS THE WORLD WILL WILLINGLY REMEMBER I CANNOT TELL I ADMIRE THEIR POLISH THEIR YOUTH IS ALREADY SO ACCOMPLISHED THAT IT SEEMS ABSURD TO SPEAK OF PROMISE
I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY RETORT TO THIS SO I ASKED IF MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD CHILDREN YES SHE HAS A BOY AND A GIRL THEY'RE BOTH AT SCHOOL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED AND WE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS
MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I THINK HE MUST HAVE READ THE VERSE OF THESE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE MAKING SO GREAT A STIR IN THE WORLD AND I FANCY HE FOUND IT POOR STUFF OF COURSE MUCH OF IT WAS
AND ONE OF HER GUESTS HAD FAILED HER SHE ASKED ME TO STOP THE GAP SHE WROTE IT'S ONLY DECENT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL BE BORED TO EXTINCTION IT WAS A THOROUGHLY DULL PARTY FROM THE BEGINNING BUT
ONCE OR TWICE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S EYES RESTED ON HIM SOMEWHAT ANXIOUSLY AT LAST SHE ROSE AND SHEPHERDED THE LADIES OUT OF ONE ROOM
WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW WRITERS IT WAS LIKE ADVENTURING UPON A STAGE WHICH TILL THEN
SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
THE MEN WERE SOLID THERE WAS ABOUT ALL OF THEM AN AIR OF WELL SATISFIED PROSPERITY EVERYONE TALKED A LITTLE LOUDER THAN NATURAL IN AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO MAKE THE PARTY GO AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE IN THE ROOM
MISSUS STRICKLAND USED HER ADVANTAGE WITH TACT YOU FELT THAT YOU OBLIGED HER BY ACCEPTING HER SYMPATHY WHEN IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY YOUTH I REMARKED ON THIS TO ROSE WATERFORD SHE SAID
AND ENTERTAINED WITH PROPER LAVISHNESS SHE HELD THEIR WEAKNESS FOR LIONS IN GOOD HUMOURED CONTEMPT BUT PLAYED TO THEM HER PART OF THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN OF LETTERS WITH DECORUM
MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I HAVE READ DESULTORILY THE WRITINGS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT MAY BE THAT AMONG THEM A MORE FERVID KEATS A MORE ETHEREAL SHELLEY
CHAPTER TWO WHEN SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT CHARLES STRICKLAND IT MAY SEEM UNNECESSARY THAT I SHOULD WRITE MORE A PAINTER'S MONUMENT IS HIS WORK
HE WROTE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS THEN CAME THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AND THE POETS SANG NEW SONGS
OR TO ANOTHER WHO PUSHED A BOOK FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH SOME ADVERTISED BADLY AND SOME WELL SOME WERE MODERN AND SOME WERE OLD FASHIONED THEN WE WOULD TALK OF AGENTS AND THE OFFERS THEY HAD OBTAINED FOR US
THE DINING ROOM WAS INCONVENIENTLY CROWDED THERE WAS A K C AND HIS WIFE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COLONEL MAC ANDREW AND THE WIFE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE WAY I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST BOOK BY A LUCKY CHANCE IT EXCITED ATTENTION AND VARIOUS PERSONS SOUGHT MY ACQUAINTANCE
IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
FOR EVERY DAY I HAVE GOT UP AND I HAVE GONE TO BED
THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIRTY SEVEN RATHER TALL AND PLUMP WITHOUT BEING FAT
OR TO WHILE AWAY THE TEDIUM OF A JOURNEY AND IF I MAY JUDGE FROM THE REVIEWS MANY OF THESE BOOKS ARE WELL AND CAREFULLY WRITTEN
IN POINT OF FACT HE WAS BROAD AND HEAVY WITH LARGE HANDS AND FEET AND HE WORE HIS EVENING CLOTHES CLUMSILY HE GAVE YOU SOMEWHAT THE IDEA OF A COACHMAN DRESSED UP FOR THE OCCASION HE WAS A MAN OF FORTY
I MARVEL AT THE FELICITY OF THEIR STYLE BUT WITH ALL THEIR COPIOUSNESS THEIR VOCABULARY SUGGESTS THAT THEY FINGERED ROGET'S THESAURUS IN THEIR CRADLES THEY SAY NOTHING TO ME
STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT
ROSE WATERFORD WAS A CYNIC SHE LOOKED UPON LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING NOVELS AND THE PUBLIC AS HER RAW MATERIAL NOW AND THEN SHE INVITED MEMBERS OF IT TO HER HOUSE IF THEY SHOWED AN APPRECIATION OF HER TALENT
YES TIS EAST STREET HOW SPLENDID AND LIGHT IT IS BUT REALLY IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT AN EFFECT THAT ONE GLASS OF PUNCH MUST HAVE HAD ON ME
EACH ONE KEPT TO HIS OWN OPINION AND SO THEY SEPARATED IT'S A STRANGE RACE THOSE POETS SAID THE CLERK WHO WAS VERY FOND OF SOLILOQUIZING I SHOULD LIKE SOME DAY JUST FOR A TRIAL TO TAKE SUCH NATURE UPON ME AND BE A POET MYSELF
THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES IMMEDIATELY
THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION A SORT OF BAZAR
SOME ONE OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS NOW SPOKE OF THE DREADFUL PESTILENCE THAT HAD RAGED IN THE COUNTRY A FEW YEARS BACK
HE DID SO BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING THE OTHERS REMARKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT THEY LAID HOLD OF HIM BY THE LEGS AND NOW HAPPILY FOR HIM OFF FELL HIS FATAL SHOES AND WITH THEM THE CHARM WAS AT AN END
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
TIS A BITTER CRUST ALAS AT WHICH I AM CONDEMNED TO GNAW NOBODY COULD BE MORE STEADY OR QUIET THAN THIS YOUNG MAN WE THEREFORE WISH HIM JOY OF THE EXCURSION WITH ALL OUR HEART AND
THE WELL KNOWN GROUP OF THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS
IT WAS LATE COUNCILLOR KNAP DEEPLY OCCUPIED WITH THE TIMES OF KING HANS INTENDED TO GO HOME AND MALICIOUS FATE MANAGED MATTERS SO THAT HIS FEET INSTEAD OF FINDING THEIR WAY TO HIS OWN GALOSHES SLIPPED INTO THOSE OF FORTUNE
ROME HAS ITS CORSO NAPLES ITS TOLEDO AH THAT ANDERSEN THERE HE IS AGAIN THEY WOULD CRY YET I MUST TO PLEASE MY FANCY CONTINUE QUITE QUIETLY AND ADD
HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE
TALES OF EVERY DAY LIFE SAID OUR BACHELOR INQUIRINGLY I MEAN THOSE NEW FANGLED NOVELS TWISTING AND WRITHING THEMSELVES IN THE DUST OF COMMONPLACE WHICH ALSO EXPECT TO FIND A READING PUBLIC OH EXCLAIMED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN SMILING
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY
HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
THE GOOD OLD SOUL SHE LIVED BEHIND THE EXCHANGE SHE ALWAYS HAD A FEW TWIGS OR GREEN SHOOTS IN WATER LET THE WINTER RAGE WITHOUT AS IT MIGHT THE VIOLETS EXHALED THEIR SWEET BREATH
THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
SOME ONE WILL MAKE A MISTAKE FOR CERTAIN AND TAKE THE WRONG ONES HE WILL BE A HAPPY MAN SUCH WAS THEIR CONVERSATION TWO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILLOR
WE WILL JUST STEP OUT INTO THE ANTECHAMBER WHERE CLOAKS MACKINTOSHES STICKS UMBRELLAS AND SHOES WERE DEPOSITED HERE SAT TWO FEMALE FIGURES A YOUNG AND AN OLD ONE ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AT FIRST THEY WERE SERVANTS COME TO ACCOMPANY THEIR MISTRESSES HOME
AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ET CETERA
REPLIED CARE IN A SEVERE TONE OF REPROACH NO HE WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY AND WILL ASSUREDLY BLESS THE MOMENT WHEN HE FEELS THAT HE HAS FREED HIMSELF FROM THE FATAL SHOES STUPID NONSENSE SAID THE OTHER ANGRILY
AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
NEVER HAD HIS AGE WITH WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS GRUMBLING SEEMED SO MISERABLE AS ON THIS EVENING I'LL TAKE A HACKNEY COACH THOUGHT HE BUT WHERE WERE THE HACKNEY COACHES NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
AT ALL EVENTS IT MUST BE THOSE WHICH ARE WET THOUGHT HE BUT THIS TIME IN SPITE OF HIS CLEVERNESS HE GUESSED QUITE WRONG
AS TO A PAVEMENT I CAN FIND NO TRACES OF ONE AND ALL THE LAMPS IT SEEMS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THE MOON WAS NOT YET VERY HIGH IT WAS BESIDES RATHER FOGGY SO THAT IN THE DARKNESS ALL OBJECTS SEEMED MINGLED IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION
SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES IT WAS NOON AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
WHAT CHANGE WHAT MAGNIFICENCE YONDER IN THE CANAL LAY THE SHIPS FROZEN UP AND DESERTED BY THEIR WHOLE CREWS WITH A SCREAMING CROW FOR THE SOLE OCCUPANT BUT WHEN THE SPRING WITH A GENTLE STIRRING MOTION ANNOUNCED HER ARRIVAL A NEW AND BUSY LIFE AROSE
THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN
I AM A BACHELOR IN THEOLOGIA ANSWERED THE GENTLEMAN WITH A STIFF REVERENCE THIS REPLY FULLY SATISFIED THE COUNCILLOR THE TITLE SUITED THE DRESS HE IS CERTAINLY THOUGHT HE SOME VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER SOME QUEER OLD FELLOW
THE DIFFERENCE ONLY IS THAT THE POET POSSESSES A BETTER MENTAL MEMORY ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE FEELING AND THE THOUGHT TILL THEY CAN BE EMBODIED BY MEANS OF WORDS A FACULTY WHICH THE OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS BUT THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMONPLACE NATURE
BESIDES HOW ASHAMED WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TO BE FOUND CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE AN OUTWITTED FOX HOW WAS HE TO TWIST HIMSELF THROUGH HE SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HIS IRREVOCABLE DESTINY TO REMAIN A PRISONER TILL DAWN OR PERHAPS EVEN LATE IN THE MORNING
THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED
THEY TOOK HOLD OF THE WORTHY MAN WHO HEARING ON EVERY SIDE THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED
AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD
THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR
EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES
SOME WRETCHED HOVELS FOR THE DUTCH SAILORS RESEMBLING GREAT BOXES AND AFTER WHICH THE PLACE WAS NAMED LAY ABOUT IN CONFUSED DISORDER ON THE OPPOSITE BANK I EITHER BEHOLD A FATA MORGANA OR I AM REGULARLY TIPSY WHIMPERED OUT THE COUNCILLOR BUT WHAT'S THIS
THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME
WHILE THE SOUND PERSONS WENT AWAY THEY WERE NAMELY CASTS OF FEMALE FRIENDS WHOSE BODILY OR MENTAL DEFORMITIES WERE HERE MOST FAITHFULLY PRESERVED WITH THE SNAKE LIKE WRITHINGS OF AN IDEA HE GLIDED INTO ANOTHER FEMALE HEART BUT THIS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE A LARGE HOLY FANE
ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW THE COUNCILLOR ASKED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MUMMERY AND WHO THAT MAN WAS THAT'S THE BISHOP OF ZEALAND WAS THE ANSWER GOOD HEAVENS WHAT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE BISHOP SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR SHAKING HIS HEAD IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE THE BISHOP
ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR
THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE WHY THERE IS A PAIR OF GALOSHES AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID THE WATCHMAN AWAKING FROM A GENTLE SLUMBER THEY BELONG NO DOUBT TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY THEY LIE CLOSE TO THE DOOR
NO DOUBT IT WOULD IN ITS ANXIETY RUN OFF TO THE POLICE AND THEN TO THE HUE AND CRY OFFICE TO ANNOUNCE THAT
A FEW PERSONS IN THE COSTUME OF THE TIME OF KING HANS PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM HOW STRANGE THEY LOOK THE GOOD FOLKS COME PROBABLY FROM A MASQUERADE
IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME
THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
THE SHOES OF FORTUNE HAD PLACED HIM IN THE MOST DREADFUL SITUATION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO WISH HIMSELF FREE THE PITCH BLACK CLOUDS POURED DOWN THEIR CONTENTS IN STILL HEAVIER TORRENTS NOT A CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS TO REACH UP TO THE BELL WAS WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE
THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY O HEAVENS
ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED
THAT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DREAM SAID HE BUT TWAS DROLL ENOUGH ALTOGETHER
LONG HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST
THE COUNCILLOR STOOD STILL AND WATCHED A MOST STRANGE PROCESSION PASS BY FIRST CAME A DOZEN DRUMMERS WHO UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL HOW TO HANDLE THEIR INSTRUMENTS THEN CAME HALBERDIERS AND SOME ARMED WITH CROSS BOWS THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE PROCESSION WAS A PRIEST
ON WHICH ACCOUNT HIS FOOT VERY NATURALLY SANK IN THE MUD AND PUDDLES OF THE STREET THERE HAVING BEEN IN THOSE DAYS NO PAVEMENT IN COPENHAGEN WELL THIS IS TOO BAD HOW DIRTY IT IS HERE SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR
OH MY BLOOD IS MOUNTING TO MY BRAIN TIS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD I SHALL GO WILD I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO OH WERE I BUT LOOSE MY DIZZINESS WOULD THEN CEASE OH WERE MY HEAD BUT LOOSE
O THOU TO WHOM I DO MY HEART DEVOTE OH READ THIS PAGE OF GLAD DAYS NOW REMOTE A DARK DARK TALE WHICH I TONIGHT DEVOTE DARK IS THE FUTURE NOW ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MEN'S PAINS
EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
AND FROM THE GREEN HERBAGE A FRAGRANCE IS EXHALED THAT FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT FOR MANY A YEAR HAVE I NOT FELT AS AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE ALREADY BY THE FOREGOING EFFUSION THAT HE IS BECOME A POET TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF IT HOWEVER WOULD IN MOST CASES BE INSIPID
THERE IS MUCH WIT IN THEM BESIDES THEY ARE READ AT COURT THE KING LIKES THE HISTORY OF SIR IFFVEN AND SIR GAUDIAN PARTICULARLY WHICH TREATS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE JOKED ABOUT IT WITH HIS HIGH VASSALS I HAVE NOT READ THAT NOVEL SAID THE COUNCILLOR
THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY
WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING IT WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR
HE TURNED ROUND ANEW FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL HE GAZED AT THE STREET FORMERLY SO WELL KNOWN TO HIM AND NOW SO STRANGE IN APPEARANCE AND LOOKED AT THE HOUSES MORE ATTENTIVELY MOST OF THEM WERE OF WOOD SLIGHTLY PUT TOGETHER AND MANY HAD A THATCHED ROOF NO
THE OTHER HOWEVER RETAINED SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO WHISPER TO HIM TIS A BET AND I HAVE WON IT BUT THE FIRST THING HE DID AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME WAS TO HAVE A LARGE BLISTER PUT ON HIS CHEST AND BACK TO DRAW OUT HIS MADNESS
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
FOR IT IS A MOST FOOLISH NOTION TO FANCY A POET DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN AMONG THE LATTER THERE MAY BE FAR MORE POETICAL NATURES THAN MANY AN ACKNOWLEDGED POET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY COULD BOAST OF
WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY
AS SEEN IN THE TOWN OF COLOGNE WHICH WAS TO BE READ BELOW IN BRIGHT LETTERS THAT IS VERY OLD SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHOM THIS PIECE OF ANTIQUITY BEGAN TO MAKE CONSIDERABLY MORE CHEERFUL PRAY HOW DID YOU COME INTO POSSESSION OF THIS RARE PRINT
OH WERE I RICH OH WERE I RICH SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH OH WERE I RICH AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH
DOES YOUR HONOR WANT TO CROSS THE FERRY TO THE HOLME ASKED THEY ACROSS TO THE HOLME SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE AT THAT MOMENT WAS NO I AM GOING TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN TO LITTLE MARKET STREET BOTH MEN STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS
BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H C ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES
WITH SONGS AND HURRAHS THE ICE WAS SAWN ASUNDER THE SHIPS WERE FRESH TARRED AND RIGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SAIL AWAY TO DISTANT LANDS BUT I HAVE REMAINED HERE
IT MUST BE HERE ON THIS VERY SPOT YET THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF RESEMBLANCE TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED THIS NIGHT AT ALL EVENTS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UP AND STIRRING OH OH I AM CERTAINLY VERY ILL HE NOW HIT UPON A HALF OPEN DOOR
THOSE WHO DO NOT LIKE HIM MAGNIFY IT SHRUG UP THEIR SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIM THERE HE IS AGAIN
OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I
THE COPYING CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
IN A POLICE OFFICE CONSEQUENTLY WE FIND COPYING CLERKS AMONG MANY OTHER SCRIBES OF VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF WHICH IT SEEMS OUR HERO WAS ONE
IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW IT GROWS MUCH WORSE THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO
THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE INFORMED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE PEOPLE TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT AND IN THE MORNING THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE HOSPITAL NOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY JOKE IF THE SPIRIT WHEN IT CAME BACK AND LOOKED FOR THE BODY IN EAST STREET WERE NOT TO FIND ONE
I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT
I AM FAR FROM WELL SIGHED HE AND YET I DRANK ONLY ONE GLASS OF PUNCH BUT I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT IT WAS TOO REALLY VERY WRONG TO GIVE US PUNCH AND HOT SALMON FOR SUPPER
ONE MUST HAVE MORE THAN THE EYE OF A SHOEMAKER TO KNOW ONE PAIR FROM THE OTHER SAID HE SOLILOQUIZING AND PUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THE GALOSHES IN SEARCH OF AN OWNER BESIDE HIS OWN IN THE CORNER HERE SIR SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO PANTING BROUGHT HIM A TREMENDOUS PILE OF PAPERS
WOULD TO HEAVEN I COULD BUT CHANGE WITH HIM HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHILE EXPRESSING HIS WISH THE CHARM OF THE SHOES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON BEGAN TO WORK THE WATCHMAN ENTERED INTO THE BEING AND NATURE OF THE LIEUTENANT
AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT
YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
THE WORTHY MAN WAS INCLINED TO RING AND DELIVER THEM AT THE HOUSE FOR THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW
BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN
BUT ON LOOKING NEARER ONE SOON SAW THEY COULD SCARCELY BE MERE SERVANTS
AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD
WAS A SORT OF HOSTELRY OF THOSE TIMES A KIND OF PUBLIC HOUSE THE ROOM HAD SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE CLAY FLOORED HALLS IN HOLSTEIN A PRETTY NUMEROUS COMPANY CONSISTING OF SEAMEN COPENHAGEN BURGHERS AND A FEW SCHOLARS SAT HERE IN DEEP CONVERSE OVER THEIR PEWTER CANS
THE HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WAS USED AS A WEATHER COCK WHICH WAS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER WITH THE DOORS AND SO THEY OPENED AND SHUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WHENEVER THE STERN OLD HUSBAND TURNED ROUND HEREUPON HE WANDERED INTO A BOUDOIR FORMED ENTIRELY OF MIRRORS LIKE THE ONE IN CASTLE ROSENBURG
THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
IF WITH A WHOLE SKIN HE WERE ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE RAILINGS THERE ON THE FLOOR LAY THE GALOSHES WHICH THE WATCHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN HE NEVER DREAMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF FORTUNE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF CONSOLINGLY WHILE HIS EYE RAN OVER THE FIRST PAGE DAME TIGBRITH TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS WHAT IS THAT AND YET IT IS UNDENIABLY MY OWN HANDWRITING HAVE I WRITTEN THE TRAGEDY WONDERFUL VERY WONDERFUL AND THIS WHAT HAVE I HERE
SO HE PUT THEM ON THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE WELL THERE HE STOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY
BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE PRETTY NEARLY AS FOLLOWS A CERTAIN PERSON HAD AN AUNT WHO BOASTED OF PARTICULAR SKILL IN FORTUNE TELLING WITH CARDS AND WHO WAS CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY PERSONS THAT WANTED TO HAVE A PEEP INTO FUTURITY BUT SHE WAS FULL OF MYSTERY ABOUT HER ART
A VERY LARGE PARTY IN ORDER AS IS OFTEN THE CASE TO GET A RETURN INVITATION FROM THE OTHERS
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DECENT SHOP FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER NOTHING BUT WRETCHED HUTS CAN I SEE ANYWHERE JUST AS IF I WERE AT RINGSTEAD OH I AM ILL I CAN SCARCELY BEAR MYSELF ANY LONGER WHERE THE DEUCE CAN THE HOUSE BE
OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
ONLY JUST TELL ME WHERE THE BRIDGE IS SAID HE IT IS REALLY UNPARDONABLE THAT THERE ARE NO LAMPS HERE AND IT IS AS DIRTY AS IF ONE HAD TO WADE THROUGH A MORASS THE LONGER HE SPOKE WITH THE BOATMEN THE MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE DID THEIR LANGUAGE BECOME TO HIM
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BORNHOLMISH DIALECT SAID HE AT LAST ANGRILY AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BRIDGE THERE WAS NO RAILWAY EITHER IT IS REALLY DISGRACEFUL WHAT A STATE THIS PLACE IS IN MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF
MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD SUCH IS MY FATE
SO YOU ARE GOING AWAY AGAIN SAID THE CLERK YOU ARE A VERY FREE AND HAPPY BEING WE OTHERS ARE CHAINED BY THE LEG AND HELD FAST TO OUR DESK YES BUT IT IS A CHAIN FRIEND WHICH ENSURES YOU THE BLESSED BREAD OF EXISTENCE ANSWERED THE POET
IT IS A VERY OLD NAME AND AS WELL AS I RECOLLECT HE WAS THE FIRST PRINTER THAT APPEARED IN DENMARK YES HE IS OUR FIRST PRINTER REPLIED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN HASTILY SO FAR ALL WENT ON WELL
GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME
THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE FIVE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING CLERK THE WATCHMAN
I AM VERY SURE I SHOULD MAKE NO SUCH MISERABLE VERSES AS THE OTHERS TODAY METHINKS IS A MOST DELICIOUS DAY FOR A POET NATURE SEEMS ANEW TO CELEBRATE HER AWAKENING INTO LIFE THE AIR IS SO UNUSUALLY CLEAR THE CLOUDS SAIL ON SO BUOYANTLY
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
THAT HE WAS ILL SHE COMPREHENDED DIRECTLY SO SHE BROUGHT HIM A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH TASTED CERTAINLY PRETTY STRONG OF THE SEA ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN FETCHED FROM THE WELL THE COUNCILLOR SUPPORTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND DREW A LONG BREATH AND THOUGHT OVER ALL THE WONDROUS THINGS HE SAW AROUND HIM
BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE OH POOR ME AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND
HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
THE PART OF THE BODY MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS NO DOUBT THE HEAD
BUT HERE THE GLASSES MAGNIFIED TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SAT LIKE A DALAI LAMA THE INSIGNIFICANT SELF OF THE PERSON QUITE CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN GREATNESS HE THEN IMAGINED HE HAD GOT INTO A NEEDLE CASE FULL OF POINTED NEEDLES OF EVERY SIZE
BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN
IT MUST BE QUITE A NEW ONE THAT HEIBERG HAS PUBLISHED LATELY NO ANSWERED THE THEOLOGIAN OF THE TIME OF KING HANS THAT BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY A HEIBERG BUT WAS IMPRINTED BY GODFREY VON GEHMEN OH IS THAT THE AUTHOR'S NAME SAID THE COUNCILLOR
DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT
WAS AGAIN SILENT GREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS COME TO ME
AND AS HE GETS ACCUSTOMED TO THE HEAT MOVES TO ANOTHER HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE OF COURSE THE VAPOR IS WARMEST IN THIS MANNER HE ASCENDS GRADUALLY TO THE HIGHEST AND SO THERE HE LAY ON THE UPPERMOST BANK IN THE VAPOR BATH
AND GETTING UP HE PUT ON A GRAY DRESSING GOWN LINED WITH BLUE SILK TIED THE TASSELS IN A KNOT AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH OF AIR INTO HIS BROAD BARE CHEST HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW WITH HIS USUAL CONFIDENT STEP
WIPED HIS FACE SQUARED HIS CHEST AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM IT WAS FRIDAY AND IN THE DINING ROOM THE GERMAN WATCHMAKER WAS WINDING UP THE CLOCK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REMEMBERED HIS JOKE ABOUT THIS PUNCTUAL BALD WATCHMAKER
WHEN HE WAS DRESSED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SPRINKLED SOME SCENT ON HIMSELF PULLED DOWN HIS SHIRT CUFFS DISTRIBUTED INTO HIS POCKETS HIS CIGARETTES POCKETBOOK MATCHES AND WATCH WITH ITS DOUBLE CHAIN AND SEALS AND SHAKING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF
THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING OF ALL WAS THAT HIS PECUNIARY INTERESTS SHOULD IN THIS WAY ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF HIS RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LED ON BY HIS INTERESTS THAT HE MIGHT SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF THE FOREST THAT IDEA HURT HIM
SHE HAD REFUSED TO SEE HER HUSBAND IT'S THAT IDIOTIC SMILE THAT'S TO BLAME FOR IT ALL THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH BUT WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHAT'S TO BE DONE HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN DESPAIR
AND DROPPED SOME INNUENDOES REFLECTING ON THE MINISTRY WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC QUICKWITTEDNESS HE CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF EACH INNUENDO DIVINED WHENCE IT CAME AT WHOM AND ON WHAT GROUND IT WAS AIMED AND THAT AFFORDED HIM AS IT ALWAYS DID A CERTAIN SATISFACTION
AND TRYING ASSIDUOUSLY TO GIVE HER FEATURES A SEVERE AND CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSION SHE FELT SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM AND AFRAID OF THE COMING INTERVIEW
IN A RAPID GLANCE SHE SCANNED HIS FIGURE THAT BEAMED WITH HEALTH AND FRESHNESS YES HE IS HAPPY AND CONTENT SHE THOUGHT WHILE I AND THAT DISGUSTING GOOD NATURE WHICH EVERY ONE LIKES HIM FOR AND PRAISES I HATE THAT GOOD NATURE OF HIS SHE THOUGHT HER MOUTH STIFFENED
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MEANWHILE HAVING PACIFIED THE CHILD AND KNOWING FROM THE SOUND OF THE CARRIAGE THAT HE HAD GONE OFF WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER BEDROOM IT WAS HER SOLITARY REFUGE FROM THE HOUSEHOLD CARES WHICH
AND DECEIT AND LYING WERE OPPOSED TO HIS NATURE IT MUST BE SOME TIME THOUGH IT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS HE SAID TRYING TO GIVE HIMSELF COURAGE
COME THAT'LL DO YOU CAN GO SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH BLUSHING SUDDENLY WELL NOW DO DRESS ME HE TURNED TO MATVEY AND THREW OFF HIS DRESSING GOWN DECISIVELY
AND OPENED HIS EYES YES YES HOW WAS IT NOW HE THOUGHT GOING OVER HIS DREAM NOW HOW WAS IT TO BE SURE ALABIN WAS GIVING A DINNER AT DARMSTADT NO NOT DARMSTADT BUT SOMETHING AMERICAN YES BUT THEN DARMSTADT WAS IN AMERICA YES
THERE WAS A SOB IN HIS THROAT SHE SHUT THE BUREAU WITH A SLAM AND GLANCED AT HIM DOLLY WHAT CAN I SAY ONE THING FORGIVE REMEMBER CANNOT NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE ATONE FOR AN INSTANT SHE DROPPED HER EYES AND LISTENED
EXPECTING WHAT HE WOULD SAY AS IT WERE BESEECHING HIM IN SOME WAY OR OTHER TO MAKE HER BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY INSTANT OF PASSION HE SAID AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT AT THAT WORD AS AT A PANG OF PHYSICAL PAIN HER LIPS STIFFENED AGAIN
AND HER FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED SHE SEEMED TO BE PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A FEW SECONDS AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND GETTING UP RAPIDLY SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR WELL SHE LOVES MY CHILD HE THOUGHT
WELL WHAT IS THAT TO ME I CAN'T SEE HER SHE CRIED
A WORN OUT WOMAN NO LONGER YOUNG OR GOOD LOOKING AND IN NO WAY REMARKABLE OR INTERESTING MERELY A GOOD MOTHER OUGHT FROM A SENSE OF FAIRNESS TO TAKE AN INDULGENT VIEW IT HAD TURNED OUT QUITE THE OTHER WAY OH IT'S AWFUL
HIS FACE UTTERLY INVOLUNTARILY REFLEX SPINAL ACTION REFLECTED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WHO WAS FOND OF PHYSIOLOGY UTTERLY INVOLUNTARILY ASSUMED ITS HABITUAL GOOD HUMORED AND THEREFORE IDIOTIC SMILE
AND GOING TO THE DOOR HE CALLED THEM THEY THREW DOWN THE BOX THAT REPRESENTED A TRAIN AND CAME IN TO THEIR FATHER THE LITTLE GIRL HER FATHER'S FAVORITE RAN UP BOLDLY EMBRACED HIM AND HUNG LAUGHINGLY ON HIS NECK
STILL HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER SOFT LITTLE HAND HE TOOK OFF THE MANTELPIECE WHERE HE HAD PUT IT YESTERDAY A LITTLE BOX OF SWEETS AND GAVE HER TWO PICKING OUT HER FAVORITES A CHOCOLATE AND A FONDANT FOR GRISHA
WHY DO YOU TELL ME THAT DON'T YOU KNOW MATVEY PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS JACKET POCKETS THRUST OUT ONE LEG AND GAZED SILENTLY GOOD HUMOREDLY WITH A FAINT SMILE AT HIS MASTER I TOLD THEM TO COME ON SUNDAY AND TILL THEN NOT TO TROUBLE YOU OR THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING HE SAID
THE WIDOW OF A STAFF CAPTAIN KALININ CAME WITH A REQUEST IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE BUT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS HE GENERALLY DID MADE HER SIT DOWN HEARD HER TO THE END ATTENTIVELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER AND GAVE HER DETAILED ADVICE AS TO HOW AND TO WHOM TO APPLY
THAT SHE MUST TAKE SOME STEP TO PUNISH HIM PUT HIM TO SHAME AVENGE ON HIM SOME LITTLE PART AT LEAST OF THE SUFFERING HE HAD CAUSED HER SHE STILL CONTINUED TO TELL HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HIM BUT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS ALREADY WASHED AND COMBED AND READY TO BE DRESSED WHEN MATVEY STEPPING DELIBERATELY IN HIS CREAKY BOOTS
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT ANSWER AS THE BARBER WAS AT WORK ON HIS UPPER LIP AND HE RAISED ONE FINGER MATVEY NODDED AT THE LOOKING GLASS ALONE IS THE ROOM TO BE GOT READY UPSTAIRS INFORM DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WHERE SHE ORDERS
SHOULD THEY HAVE ANY MILK SHOULD NOT A NEW COOK BE SENT FOR AH LET ME ALONE LET ME ALONE SHE SAID AND GOING BACK TO HER BEDROOM SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AS SHE HAD SAT WHEN TALKING TO HER HUSBAND CLASPING TIGHTLY HER THIN HANDS WITH THE RINGS THAT SLIPPED DOWN ON HER BONY FINGERS
THREE DAYS AFTER THE QUARREL PRINCE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH OBLONSKY
YOU HAVE NEITHER HEART NOR HONORABLE FEELING
AS IT WAS EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THESE THREE DAYS THE YOUNGEST WAS UNWELL FROM BEING GIVEN UNWHOLESOME SOUP AND THE OTHERS HAD ALMOST GONE WITHOUT THEIR DINNER THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AWAY BUT CHEATING HERSELF SHE WENT ON ALL THE SAME SORTING OUT HER THINGS
BUT DOLLY FORGIVE ME SHE SAT DOWN HE LISTENED TO HER HARD HEAVY BREATHING
BUT AFTER ALL WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE I KEPT MYSELF IN HAND AND THE WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT SHE'S ALREADY IT SEEMS AS IF ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT SO
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS LETTERS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MOVED THE OFFICE PAPERS CLOSE TO HIM RAPIDLY LOOKED THROUGH TWO PIECES OF BUSINESS MADE A FEW NOTES WITH A BIG PENCIL AND PUSHING AWAY THE PAPERS TURNED TO HIS COFFEE AS HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE HE OPENED A STILL DAMP MORNING PAPER
AND THERE WERE SOME SORT OF LITTLE DECANTERS ON THE TABLE AND THEY WERE WOMEN TOO HE REMEMBERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES TWINKLED GAILY AND HE PONDERED WITH A SMILE YES IT WAS NICE VERY NICE
AND SHE WENT OUT SLAMMING THE DOOR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SIGHED WIPED HIS FACE AND WITH A SUBDUED TREAD WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM MATVEY SAYS SHE WILL COME ROUND BUT HOW I DON'T SEE THE LEAST CHANCE OF IT AH OH HOW HORRIBLE IT IS
BETRAYED BEWILDERMENT AND SUFFERING DOLLY HE SAID IN A SUBDUED AND TIMID VOICE HE BENT HIS HEAD TOWARDS HIS SHOULDER AND TRIED TO LOOK PITIFUL AND HUMBLE BUT FOR ALL THAT HE WAS RADIANT WITH FRESHNESS AND HEALTH
HOW WELL WE GOT ON SHE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY IN HER CHILDREN I NEVER INTERFERED WITH HER IN ANYTHING I LET HER MANAGE THE CHILDREN AND THE HOUSE JUST AS SHE LIKED IT'S TRUE IT'S BAD HER HAVING BEEN A GOVERNESS IN OUR HOUSE THAT'S BAD THERE'S SOMETHING COMMON
AND HOW VULGARLY SHE SHOUTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF REMEMBERING HER SHRIEK AND THE WORDS SCOUNDREL AND MISTRESS AND VERY LIKELY THE MAIDS WERE LISTENING HORRIBLY VULGAR HORRIBLE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH STOOD A FEW SECONDS ALONE
HAVING FINISHED THE PAPER A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE AND A ROLL AND BUTTER HE GOT UP SHAKING THE CRUMBS OF THE ROLL OFF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SQUARING HIS BROAD CHEST HE SMILED JOYOUSLY NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS ANYTHING PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE IN HIS MIND
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MATVEY REPEATED AS THOUGH IN DOUBT YES INFORM HER HERE TAKE THE TELEGRAM GIVE IT TO HER AND THEN DO WHAT SHE TELLS YOU YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON MATVEY UNDERSTOOD BUT HE ONLY SAID YES SIR
THE WIFE HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE HUSBAND WAS CARRYING ON AN INTRIGUE WITH A FRENCH GIRL WHO HAD BEEN A GOVERNESS IN THEIR FAMILY AND SHE HAD ANNOUNCED TO HER HUSBAND THAT SHE COULD NOT GO ON LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM THIS POSITION OF AFFAIRS HAD NOW LASTED THREE DAYS
SHE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO BEGIN TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT HE WAITED YOU REMEMBER THE CHILDREN STIVA TO PLAY WITH THEM BUT I REMEMBER THEM AND KNOW THAT THIS MEANS THEIR RUIN SHE SAID
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
AND NOW DON'T I LOVE HIM DON'T I LOVE HIM MORE THAN BEFORE THE MOST HORRIBLE THING IS SHE BEGAN BUT DID NOT FINISH HER THOUGHT
THIS IDIOTIC SMILE HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HIMSELF CATCHING SIGHT OF THAT SMILE DOLLY SHUDDERED AS THOUGH AT PHYSICAL PAIN BROKE OUT WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC HEAT INTO A FLOOD OF CRUEL WORDS AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM SINCE THEN
THEY'VE SENT FROM THE CARRIAGE JOBBERS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MADE NO REPLY HE MERELY GLANCED AT MATVEY IN THE LOOKING GLASS IN THE GLANCE IN WHICH THEIR EYES MET IN THE LOOKING GLASS IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES ASKED
EH MATVEY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR SHE WILL COME ROUND SAID MATVEY COME ROUND YES SIR DO YOU THINK SO WHO'S THERE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HEARING THE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS AT THE DOOR IT'S I
WERE HEARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEY WERE CARRYING SOMETHING AND DROPPED IT I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIT PASSENGERS ON THE ROOF SAID THE LITTLE GIRL IN ENGLISH THERE PICK THEM UP EVERYTHING'S IN CONFUSION THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH THERE ARE THE CHILDREN RUNNING ABOUT BY THEMSELVES
THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK CONTRACTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER PALE NERVOUS FACE WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID IN A RAPID DEEP UNNATURAL VOICE DOLLY HE REPEATED WITH A QUIVER IN HIS VOICE
ALTHOUGH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS COMPLETELY IN THE WRONG AS REGARDS HIS WIFE AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THIS HIMSELF ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE EVEN THE NURSE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S CHIEF ALLY WAS ON HIS SIDE
AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
SAID A FIRM PLEASANT WOMAN'S VOICE AND THE STERN POCKMARKED FACE OF MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA THE NURSE WAS THRUST IN AT THE DOORWAY WELL WHAT IS IT MATRONA QUERIED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
AND FOR THAT REASON I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO SAVE THEM BUT I DON'T MYSELF KNOW HOW TO SAVE THEM BY TAKING THEM AWAY FROM THEIR FATHER OR BY LEAVING THEM WITH A VICIOUS FATHER YES A VICIOUS FATHER TELL ME AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA IN A DRESSING JACKET AND WITH HER NOW SCANTY ONCE LUXURIANT AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR FASTENED UP WITH HAIRPINS ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WITH A SUNKEN THIN FACE AND LARGE STARTLED EYES
LET US SEND FOR MY BROTHER SHE SAID
THAT'S AS IT HAPPENS BUT HERE'S FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID TAKING TEN ROUBLES FROM HIS POCKETBOOK THAT'LL BE ENOUGH ENOUGH OR NOT ENOUGH WE MUST MAKE IT DO SAID MATVEY SLAMMING THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND STEPPING BACK ONTO THE STEPS
HOW IS MAMMA HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S SMOOTH SOFT LITTLE NECK GOOD MORNING HE SAID SMILING TO THE BOY WHO HAD COME UP TO GREET HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOVED THE BOY LESS AND ALWAYS TRIED TO BE FAIR BUT THE BOY FELT IT
IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE WANTED TO FORGET HIS WIFE AH YES HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND HIS HANDSOME FACE ASSUMED A HARASSED EXPRESSION TO GO OR NOT TO GO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
SAID THE LITTLE GIRL POINTING TO THE CHOCOLATE YES YES
NOTICING THE CHANGE OF HER FACE AT THE CHILD'S CRY MY CHILD HOW CAN SHE HATE ME DOLLY ONE WORD MORE HE SAID FOLLOWING HER IF YOU COME NEAR ME I WILL CALL IN THE SERVANTS THE CHILDREN THEY MAY ALL KNOW YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL I AM GOING AWAY AT ONCE AND YOU MAY LIVE HERE WITH YOUR MISTRESS
SEEING HER HUSBAND SHE DROPPED HER HANDS INTO THE DRAWER OF THE BUREAU AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND ONLY LOOKED ROUND AT HIM WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE UP TO HER BUT HER FACE TO WHICH SHE TRIED TO GIVE A SEVERE AND RESOLUTE EXPRESSION
TRANSLATED BY CONSTANCE GARNETT PART ONE CHAPTER ONE HAPPY FAMILIES ARE ALL ALIKE EVERY UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY
AND THAT THE STRAY PEOPLE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY CHANCE IN ANY INN HAD MORE IN COMMON WITH ONE ANOTHER THAN THEY THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD OF THE OBLONSKYS THE WIFE DID NOT LEAVE HER OWN ROOM THE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME FOR THREE DAYS
AS HE REMEMBERED THE ACUTELY PAINFUL SENSATIONS CAUSED HIM BY THIS QUARREL MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL WAS THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN ON COMING HAPPY AND GOOD HUMORED FROM THE THEATER WITH A HUGE PEAR IN HIS HAND FOR HIS WIFE HE HAD NOT FOUND HIS WIFE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
BUT TODAY THAT SATISFACTION WAS EMBITTERED BY MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA'S ADVICE AND THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
ONE MUST LIVE IN THE NEEDS OF THE DAY THAT IS FORGET ONESELF TO FORGET HIMSELF IN SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW AT LEAST TILL NIGHTTIME HE COULD NOT GO BACK NOW TO THE MUSIC SUNG BY THE DECANTER WOMEN SO HE MUST FORGET HIMSELF IN THE DREAM OF DAILY LIFE
AND CERTAINLY STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD MANY DEBTS AND WAS DECIDEDLY SHORT OF MONEY THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION QUITE OUT OF DATE AND THAT IT NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY LIFE CERTAINLY AFFORDED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH LITTLE GRATIFICATION
THAT THE GERMAN WAS WOUND UP FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME HIMSELF TO WIND UP WATCHES AND HE SMILED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS FOND OF A JOKE AND MAYBE SHE WILL COME ROUND THAT'S A GOOD EXPRESSION COME ROUND HE THOUGHT I MUST REPEAT THAT MATVEY HE SHOUTED
TO SORT OUT THE CHILDREN'S THINGS AND HER OWN SO AS TO TAKE THEM TO HER MOTHER'S AND AGAIN SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO DO THIS BUT NOW AGAIN AS EACH TIME BEFORE SHE KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF THAT THINGS CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS
BUT HE FELT ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION AND WAS SORRY FOR HIS WIFE HIS CHILDREN AND HIMSELF
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD NOT CHOSEN HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS OR HIS VIEWS THESE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND VIEWS HAD COME TO HIM OF THEMSELVES JUST AS HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE SHAPES OF HIS HAT AND COAT BUT SIMPLY TOOK THOSE THAT WERE BEING WORN AND FOR HIM
THE JOYOUS SMILE WAS EVOKED BY A GOOD DIGESTION BUT THIS JOYOUS SMILE AT ONCE RECALLED EVERYTHING TO HIM AND HE GREW THOUGHTFUL TWO CHILDISH VOICES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH RECOGNIZED THE VOICES OF GRISHA HIS YOUNGEST BOY AND TANYA HIS ELDEST GIRL
THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT BUT FALSITY THAT TO AMEND TO SET RIGHT THEIR RELATIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HER ATTRACTIVE AGAIN AND ABLE TO INSPIRE LOVE OR TO MAKE HIM AN OLD MAN NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOVE EXCEPT DECEIT AND LYING NOTHING COULD COME OF IT NOW
HE READ THE LETTERS ONE WAS VERY UNPLEASANT FROM A MERCHANT WHO WAS BUYING A FOREST ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY TO SELL THIS FOREST WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BUT AT PRESENT UNTIL HE WAS RECONCILED WITH HIS WIFE THE SUBJECT COULD NOT BE DISCUSSED
AND LET HER GO THE CARRIAGE IS READY SAID MATVEY BUT THERE'S SOME ONE TO SEE YOU WITH A PETITION BEEN HERE LONG ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HALF AN HOUR HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE
AND SAW HER AT LAST IN HER BEDROOM WITH THE UNLUCKY LETTER THAT REVEALED EVERYTHING IN HER HAND SHE HIS DOLLY FOREVER FUSSING AND WORRYING OVER HOUSEHOLD DETAILS AND LIMITED IN HER IDEAS AS HE CONSIDERED
HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN ADAPTING HIS FACE TO THE POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED TOWARDS HIS WIFE BY THE DISCOVERY OF HIS FAULT INSTEAD OF BEING HURT DENYING DEFENDING HIMSELF BEGGING FORGIVENESS INSTEAD OF REMAINING INDIFFERENT EVEN ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WHAT HE DID DO
HE FIRMLY HELD THOSE VIEWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WERE HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND BY HIS PAPER AND HE ONLY CHANGED THEM WHEN THE MAJORITY CHANGED THEM OR MORE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT CHANGE THEM BUT THEY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGED OF THEMSELVES WITHIN HIM
A HANDSOME SUSCEPTIBLE MAN OF THIRTY FOUR WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE THE MOTHER OF FIVE LIVING AND TWO DEAD CHILDREN AND ONLY A YEAR YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF
WAS NOT SO MUCH ANNOYED AT THE FACT ITSELF AS AT THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD MET HIS WIFE'S WORDS THERE HAPPENED TO HIM AT THAT INSTANT WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE UNEXPECTEDLY CAUGHT IN SOMETHING VERY DISGRACEFUL
WHICH WERE HELD ALSO BY MANY OF HIS CIRCLE IT AROSE NOT FROM HIS CONSIDERING LIBERALISM MORE RATIONAL BUT FROM ITS BEING IN CLOSER ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT IN RUSSIA EVERYTHING IS WRONG
LAUGHING ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WATCHED HIS MASTER WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS SILENT A MINUTE THEN A GOOD HUMORED AND RATHER PITIFUL SMILE SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS HANDSOME FACE
AND EVEN WROTE HER IN HIS LARGE SPRAWLING GOOD AND LEGIBLE HAND A CONFIDENT AND FLUENT LITTLE NOTE TO A PERSONAGE WHO MIGHT BE OF USE TO HER HAVING GOT RID OF THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S WIDOW STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND STOPPED TO RECOLLECT WHETHER HE HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
AND NOT ONLY THE HUSBAND AND WIFE THEMSELVES BUT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD WERE PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF IT EVERY PERSON IN THE HOUSE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO SENSE IN THEIR LIVING TOGETHER
AS THOUGH THIS SHRIEK WERE CALLED UP BY PHYSICAL PAIN STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD BE CALM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE HE COULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD COME ROUND AS MATVEY EXPRESSED IT AND COULD QUIETLY GO ON READING HIS PAPER AND DRINKING HIS COFFEE BUT WHEN HE SAW HER TORTURED SUFFERING FACE
THE CHILDREN RAN WILD ALL OVER THE HOUSE THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS QUARRELED WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER AND WROTE TO A FRIEND ASKING HER TO LOOK OUT FOR A NEW SITUATION FOR HER THE MAN COOK HAD WALKED OFF THE DAY BEFORE JUST AT DINNER TIME THE KITCHEN MAID AND THE COACHMAN
ARRANGE EVERYTHING WITH DARYA IN THE SITTING ROOM FOR ANNA ARKADYEVNA HE SAID TO MATVEY WHEN HE CAME IN YES SIR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH PUT ON HIS FUR COAT AND WENT OUT ONTO THE STEPS YOU WON'T DINE AT HOME SAID MATVEY SEEING HIM OFF
REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ARRIVAL THAT IS THAT ANNA ARKADYEVNA THE SISTER HE WAS SO FOND OF MIGHT BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE ALONE OR WITH HER HUSBAND INQUIRED MATVEY
HE VIGOROUSLY EMBRACED THE PILLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN IT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE JUMPED UP
WAS SITTING PERFECTLY STILL WITH THE LETTER IN HER HAND LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION WHAT'S THIS THIS SHE ASKED POINTING TO THE LETTER AND AT THIS RECOLLECTION STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE
SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF REGARDING HIM AS HER HUSBAND AND LOVING HIM BESIDES THIS SHE REALIZED THAT IF EVEN HERE IN HER OWN HOUSE SHE COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO LOOK AFTER HER FIVE CHILDREN PROPERLY THEY WOULD BE STILL WORSE OFF WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THEM ALL
ARE THERE ANY PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TAKING THE TELEGRAM AND SEATING HIMSELF AT THE LOOKING GLASS ON THE TABLE REPLIED MATVEY GLANCING WITH INQUIRING SYMPATHY AT HIS MASTER AND AFTER A SHORT PAUSE HE ADDED WITH A SLY SMILE
HE HAD OBVIOUSLY PREPARED THE SENTENCE BEFOREHAND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SAW MATVEY WANTED TO MAKE A JOKE AND ATTRACT ATTENTION TO HIMSELF TEARING OPEN THE TELEGRAM HE READ IT THROUGH GUESSING AT THE WORDS MISSPELT AS THEY ALWAYS ARE IN TELEGRAMS AND HIS FACE BRIGHTENED
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAT WAS DELIGHTFUL ONLY THERE'S NO PUTTING IT INTO WORDS OR EVEN EXPRESSING IT IN ONE'S THOUGHTS AWAKE AND NOTICING A GLEAM OF LIGHT PEEPING IN BESIDE ONE OF THE SERGE CURTAINS HE CHEERFULLY DROPPED HIS FEET OVER THE EDGE OF THE SOFA AND FELT ABOUT WITH THEM FOR HIS SLIPPERS
AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
VERY WELL I WILL COME DIRECTLY AND SEE ABOUT IT BUT DID YOU SEND FOR SOME NEW MILK
AND THAT ONE NEED HAVE NO MORE GRAY HAIR AND OF THE SALE OF A LIGHT CARRIAGE AND OF A YOUNG PERSON SEEKING A SITUATION BUT THESE ITEMS OF INFORMATION DID NOT GIVE HIM AS USUAL A QUIET IRONICAL GRATIFICATION
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE PHRASES SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPEATED TO HERSELF IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW DAYS SHE HAD CALLED HIM STIVA AND HE GLANCED AT HER WITH GRATITUDE AND MOVED TO TAKE HER HAND BUT SHE DREW BACK FROM HIM WITH AVERSION I THINK OF THE CHILDREN
EVEN IF WE REMAIN IN THE SAME HOUSE WE ARE STRANGERS STRANGERS FOREVER SHE REPEATED AGAIN WITH SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE THE WORD SO DREADFUL TO HER AND HOW I LOVED HIM MY GOD HOW I LOVED HIM HOW I LOVED HIM
FEELING HIMSELF CLEAN FRAGRANT HEALTHY AND PHYSICALLY AT EASE IN SPITE OF HIS UNHAPPINESS HE WALKED WITH A SLIGHT SWING ON EACH LEG INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE COFFEE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM AND BESIDE THE COFFEE LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE
MATVEY MY SISTER ANNA ARKADYEVNA WILL BE HERE TOMORROW HE SAID CHECKING FOR A MINUTE THE SLEEK PLUMP HAND OF THE BARBER CUTTING A PINK PATH THROUGH HIS LONG CURLY WHISKERS THANK GOD SAID MATVEY SHOWING BY THIS RESPONSE THAT HE LIKE HIS MASTER
GO TO HER SIR OWN YOUR FAULT AGAIN MAYBE GOD WILL AID YOU SHE IS SUFFERING SO IT'S SAD TO SEE HER
A PRESENT ON HIS LAST BIRTHDAY WORKED FOR HIM BY HIS WIFE ON GOLD COLORED MOROCCO AND AS HE HAD DONE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND WITHOUT GETTING UP TOWARDS THE PLACE WHERE HIS DRESSING GOWN ALWAYS HUNG IN HIS BEDROOM
HE AT ONCE PERCEIVED IT AND BLUSHED TOO I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID SHE DID NOT SAY WE MUST DO OUR LESSONS BUT SHE SAID WE WERE TO GO FOR A WALK WITH MISS HOOLE TO GRANDMAMMA'S WELL GO TANYA MY DARLING OH WAIT A MINUTE THOUGH HE SAID
RECALLING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AND AGAIN EVERY DETAIL OF HIS QUARREL WITH HIS WIFE WAS PRESENT TO HIS IMAGINATION ALL THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS POSITION AND WORST OF ALL HIS OWN FAULT YES SHE WON'T FORGIVE ME AND SHE CAN'T FORGIVE ME
WHICH LOOKED PROMINENT FROM THE THINNESS OF HER FACE WAS STANDING AMONG A LITTER OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM BEFORE AN OPEN BUREAU FROM WHICH SHE WAS TAKING SOMETHING HEARING HER HUSBAND'S STEPS SHE STOPPED LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR
ENJOYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID THE SMELL OF SCENT THAT CAME FROM HIS WHISKERS AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL KISSED HIS FACE WHICH WAS FLUSHED FROM HIS STOOPING POSTURE AND BEAMING WITH TENDERNESS LOOSED HER HANDS AND WAS ABOUT TO RUN AWAY AGAIN BUT HER FATHER HELD HER BACK
LIVING IN A CERTAIN SOCIETY OWING TO THE NEED ORDINARILY DEVELOPED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION FOR SOME DEGREE OF MENTAL ACTIVITY TO HAVE VIEWS WAS JUST AS INDISPENSABLE AS TO HAVE A HAT IF THERE WAS A REASON FOR HIS PREFERRING LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE VIEWS
AND THE MOST AWFUL THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S ALL MY FAULT ALL MY FAULT THOUGH I'M NOT TO BLAME
TURNING OUT HIS FEET THAT CARRIED HIS FULL FRAME SO EASILY HE PULLED UP THE BLIND AND RANG THE BELL LOUDLY IT WAS AT ONCE ANSWERED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLD FRIEND
WOKE UP AT HIS USUAL HOUR THAT IS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOT IN HIS WIFE'S BEDROOM BUT ON THE LEATHER COVERED SOFA IN HIS STUDY HE TURNED OVER HIS STOUT WELL CARED FOR PERSON ON THE SPRINGY SOFA AS THOUGH HE WOULD SINK INTO A LONG SLEEP AGAIN
CAN WE LIVE TOGETHER IS THAT POSSIBLE TELL ME EH IS IT POSSIBLE SHE REPEATED RAISING HER VOICE AFTER MY HUSBAND THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN ENTERS INTO A LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS OWN CHILDREN'S GOVERNESS
AND BEGAN READING IT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK IN AND READ A LIBERAL PAPER NOT AN EXTREME ONE BUT ONE ADVOCATING THE VIEWS HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SCIENCE ART AND POLITICS HAD NO SPECIAL INTEREST FOR HIM
VULGAR IN FLIRTING WITH ONE'S GOVERNESS BUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS A TRUTHFUL MAN IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIMSELF HE WAS INCAPABLE OF DECEIVING HIMSELF AND PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT HE REPENTED OF HIS CONDUCT HE COULD NOT AT THIS DATE REPENT OF THE FACT THAT HE
GETTING MORE AND MORE HEATED YOUR TEARS MEAN NOTHING
AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO BE DONE
HIS LIPS SWELLED HIS EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS DOLLY HE SAID SOBBING NOW FOR MERCY'S SAKE THINK OF THE CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME I AM TO BLAME AND PUNISH ME MAKE ME EXPIATE MY FAULT ANYTHING I CAN DO I AM READY TO DO ANYTHING
THERE WAS NO SOLUTION BUT THAT UNIVERSAL SOLUTION WHICH LIFE GIVES TO ALL QUESTIONS EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX AND INSOLUBLE
WHICH IS ONE OF THE SAFEST BANKS IN PARIS AND DOES MY FATHER MEAN TO REMAIN LONG IN PARIS ASKED ANDREA ONLY A FEW DAYS REPLIED MONTE CRISTO HIS SERVICE DOES NOT ALLOW HIM TO ABSENT HIMSELF MORE THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS TOGETHER AH MY DEAR FATHER
I NEVER ONCE DOUBTED YOUR DOING SO MONTE CRISTO CHOSE THIS MOMENT FOR RE ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM ON HEARING THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS THE TWO MEN THREW THEMSELVES IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND WHILE THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF THIS EMBRACE THE COUNT ENTERED
I KNEW THAT KIRSTY'S AUTHORITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO HERS AND THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE ME UP SO I WATCHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE ONCE MORE AND HIDE MYSELF SO THAT KIRSTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS
SHOULD YOU LIKE TO BE RICH AND YOUR OWN MASTER MA FOI SAID THE YOUNG MAN WAS IT POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE TWO ANSWERS TO SUCH A QUESTION TAKE THE POST CHAISE WHICH YOU WILL FIND WAITING AT THE PORTE DE GENES AS YOU ENTER NICE
AND FROM PONT DE BEAUVOISIN TO PARIS INDEED THEN YOUR FATHER OUGHT TO HAVE MET WITH YOU ON THE ROAD FOR IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME ROUTE WHICH HE HIMSELF TOOK AND THAT IS HOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE YOUR JOURNEY TO THIS PLACE
I HOPE NO FALSE REPORT AS FOR MYSELF I FIRST HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF BY MY FRIEND WILMORE THE PHILANTHROPIST I BELIEVE HE FOUND YOU IN SOME UNPLEASANT POSITION BUT DO NOT KNOW OF WHAT NATURE FOR I DID NOT ASK NOT BEING INQUISITIVE
HE DOES NOT WISH YOU TO KNOW THAT IT COMES FROM HIM I FULLY APPRECIATE HIS DELICACY SAID ANDREA CRAMMING THE NOTES HASTILY INTO HIS POCKET AND NOW GENTLEMEN I WISH YOU GOOD MORNING SAID MONTE CRISTO
HERE THEY ARE ANDREA SEIZED THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE AND HIS OWN BAPTISMAL REGISTER AND AFTER HAVING OPENED THEM WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE READ THEM WITH A FACILITY WHICH PROVED THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIMILAR DOCUMENTS
HE WAS CERTAINLY THE TALL YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT HAIR RED BEARD BLACK EYES AND BRILLIANT COMPLEXION WHOM HIS MASTER HAD SO PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED TO HIM WHEN THE COUNT ENTERED THE ROOM THE YOUNG MAN WAS CARELESSLY STRETCHED ON A SOFA TAPPING HIS BOOT WITH THE GOLD HEADED CANE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND
AND HER SKIN WAS GATHERED IN WRINKLES ABOUT HER MOUTH WHERE THEY TWITCHED AND TWITCHED AS IF SHE WERE CONSTANTLY MEDITATING SOMETHING UNPLEASANT SHE LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY I'VE BROUGHT YOU A NEW SCHOLAR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL WELL VERY WELL
FROM AN ENGLISHMAN CALLED LORD WILMORE WHO TAKES THE NAME OF SINBAD THE SAILOR AND OF WHOM YOU HAVE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN I OF THE ABBE BUSONI YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE I AM AHEAD OF YOU YOU HAVE SEEN HIM THEN YES ONCE WHERE
I MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW UP WITH IMPUNITY TWO SUCH DEEDS AS THESE IN FRANCE MY DEAR SIR HALF SUCH A PIECE OF EFFRONTERY AS THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU TO BE QUICKLY DESPATCHED TO TOULON FOR FIVE YEARS FOR CHANGE OF AIR
I WOULD OFFER MYSELF AS YOUR SURETY AND FRIENDLY ADVISER SAID MONTE CRISTO DID I NOT POSSESS A MORAL DISTRUST OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND A SORT OF INCLINATION TO LEAD OTHERS TO DOUBT THEM TOO THEREFORE IN DEPARTING FROM THIS RULE I SHOULD AS THE ACTORS SAY
SAID THE DAME IN A DUBIOUS TONE I HOPE HE'S A GOOD BOY FOR HE MUST BE GOOD IF HE COMES HERE WELL HE'S JUST MIDDLING HIS FATHER SPARES THE ROD MISSUS SHAND AND WE KNOW WHAT COMES OF THAT THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR TALK WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT
AND THERE I BURST OUT SOBBING AND CRYING IT WAS ALL THE UTTERANCE I HAD LEFT AS SOON AS KIRSTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN CALMING ME I TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY SHE SAID VERY LITTLE BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS VERY ANGRY NO DOUBT SHE WAS PONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE
YOU WOULD BE NO LONGER A LOST CHILD FOUND BUT YOU WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS AN UPSTART WHO HAD SPRUNG UP LIKE A MUSHROOM IN THE NIGHT YOU MIGHT EXCITE A LITTLE CURIOSITY
BESIDES WE ARE CONVERSING IN ITALIAN WELL THEN REPLIED THE MAJOR THEY PAID ME FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS DOWN MONSIEUR CAVALCANTI SAID ANDREA DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRY TALES
NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THE EVIL SAID MONTE CRISTO FOR BY ENDEAVORING TO AVOID ONE FAULT YOU WILL FALL INTO ANOTHER YOU MUST RESOLVE UPON ONE SIMPLE AND SINGLE LINE OF CONDUCT
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR SON SAID THE MAJOR GRAVELY AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PAINFUL SEPARATION SAID ANDREA IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE DOOR WHAT A HAPPINESS IT IS TO MEET AGAIN
NOW REPLIED MONTE CRISTO THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF UNEASINESS LEFT IN YOUR FATHER'S MIND WHICH IS THIS HE IS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED DURING YOUR LONG ABSENCE FROM HIM HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR PERSECUTORS
MOST UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED MONTE CRISTO YOUR FATHER MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THE EXPRESSION OF TERROR WHICH FOR THE MOMENT HAD OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOW DISAPPEARED AH YES THAT IS THE NAME CERTAINLY
IN SHORT YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER A VERY PRESENTABLE PERSON I ASSURE YOU AH SIR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME CONFIDENCE IT IS SO LONG SINCE WE WERE SEPARATED THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REMEMBRANCE OF HIM AND BESIDES YOU KNOW THAT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD A LARGE FORTUNE COVERS ALL DEFECTS
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH PLAINLY DENOTED AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE CONTENTS WHEN HE HAD PERUSED THE DOCUMENTS AN INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE LIGHTED UP HIS COUNTENANCE AND LOOKING AT THE MAJOR WITH A MOST PECULIAR SMILE HE SAID IN VERY EXCELLENT TUSCAN
ON PERCEIVING THE COUNT HE ROSE QUICKLY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO I BELIEVE SAID HE YES SIR AND I THINK I HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN ACCOMPANYING HIS WORDS WITH A BOW
A MISERABLE OLD AGE AWAITS YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO BECOME RICH OR AT LEAST INDEPENDENT SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR PARIS AND DEMAND OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
YOUR MISFORTUNES ENGAGED HIS SYMPATHIES SO YOU SEE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO RESTORE YOU TO THE POSITION WHICH YOU HAD LOST AND THAT HE WOULD SEEK YOUR FATHER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM HE DID SEEK AND HAS FOUND HIM APPARENTLY SINCE HE IS HERE NOW
PAYABLE IN FLORENCE AT SIGNOR GOZZI'S ALSO A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ON WHOM I GIVE YOU A DRAFT OF FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
BUT IN DESPERATION I THREW MYSELF UPON HIM AND DUG MY NAILS INTO HIM THEY HAD FORTUNATELY FOUND THEIR WAY TO HIS EYES HE WAS THE VERIEST COWARD OF HIS SPECIES HE YELPED AND HOWLED AND STRUGGLING FROM MY GRASP RAN WITH HIS TAIL MERGED IN HIS PERSON BACK TO HIS MISTRESS
THEY GIVE ME FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR TO BE YOUR SON CONSEQUENTLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY I SHALL EVER DENY MY PARENT THE MAJOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND HIM MAKE YOURSELF EASY WE ARE QUITE ALONE SAID ANDREA
SHE HAD NOT EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER I COULD READ I TOOK THE CATECHISM AND STOOD AS BEFORE GO TO YOUR SEAT SHE SAID I OBEYED AND WITH THE BOOK BEFORE ME PONDERED MY PLAN
BUT A DREARY LITTLE HOUSE WITH NOTHING GREEN TO COVER THE BROWN STONES OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT AND HAVING AN OPEN DITCH IN FRONT OF IT WITH A STONE SLAB OVER IT FOR A BRIDGE DID I SAY THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE WALLS THIS MORNING THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST SUNSHINE
WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY
AND FINALLY MY FRIEND APPRISED ME OF YOUR COMING AND GAVE ME A FEW OTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATIVE TO YOUR FUTURE FORTUNE I AM QUITE AWARE THAT MY FRIEND WILMORE IS PECULIAR BUT HE IS SINCERE AND AS RICH AS A GOLD MINE
BANKER AT NICE AND ALSO A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WHOM I HAVE DIRECTED TO SUPPLY ALL YOUR WANTS SINBAD THE SAILOR HUMPH SAID THE MAJOR VERY GOOD YOU HAVE SEEN THE COUNT YOU SAY I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIM
I'LL COME BACK FOR HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK AND IF I DON'T COME JUST KEEP HIM TILL I DO COME THE DAME ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE DOOR AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS LAME AND HOBBLED VERY MUCH A RESOLUTION AROSE FULL FORMED IN MY BRAIN
BUT WHAT WAS MY HORROR TO FIND HER COMMAND ENFORCED BY THE PURSUING BARK OF HER PRIME MINISTER THIS PARALYSED ME I TURNED AND THERE WAS THE FIENDISH LOOKING DOG CLOSE ON MY HEELS I COULD RUN NO LONGER
THEN IN THAT CASE I SHALL ALWAYS CHOOSE TO REMAIN THERE YOU CANNOT CONTROL CIRCUMSTANCES MY DEAR SIR MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES ANDREA SIGHED BUT SAID HE
AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I CANNOT TELL YOU IF I DID I SHOULD MAKE YOU AS WISE AS MYSELF WHICH IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO DO AND WHAT DID THE LETTER CONTAIN READ IT YOU ARE POOR AND YOUR FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE DARK AND GLOOMY DO YOU WISH FOR A NAME
WE WILL BE WITH YOU AT THAT TIME SAID THE MAJOR
SO LONG AS I DO REMAIN IN PARIS AND NOTHING FORCES ME TO QUIT IT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT I MAY RELY ON RECEIVING THE SUM YOU JUST NOW MENTIONED TO ME
IN THE FARTHER CORNER TWO WERE KICKING AT EACH OTHER AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED LOOKING VERY ANGRY BUT NOT DARING TO CRY MY NEXT DISCOVERY WAS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING SOME MOVEMENT DREW MY EYES TO THE FLOOR THERE I SAW A BOY OF MY OWN AGE ON ALL FOURS
I HEARD WITH HORROR BUT I WAS UP AND OFF IN A MOMENT I HAD NOT HOWEVER GOT MANY YARDS FROM THE COTTAGE BEFORE I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE DAME SCREAMING AFTER ME TO RETURN I TOOK NO HEED ONLY SPED THE FASTER
WELL IT IS ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS AND A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE HE IS A VERY RICH ENGLISHMAN ECCENTRIC ALMOST TO INSANITY AND HIS REAL NAME IS LORD WILMORE AH INDEED THEN THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID ANDREA
AND THEN TOUCHED A SPRING IN A PANEL MADE TO LOOK LIKE A PICTURE WHICH IN SLIDING PARTLY FROM THE FRAME DISCOVERED TO VIEW A SMALL OPENING SO CLEVERLY CONTRIVED THAT IT REVEALED ALL THAT WAS PASSING IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOW OCCUPIED BY CAVALCANTI AND ANDREA
BE PLAYING A PART QUITE OUT OF MY LINE AND SHOULD THEREFORE RUN THE RISK OF BEING HISSED WHICH WOULD BE AN ACT OF FOLLY HOWEVER YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID ANDREA IN CONSIDERATION OF LORD WILMORE BY WHOM I WAS RECOMMENDED TO YOU YES CERTAINLY INTERRUPTED MONTE CRISTO
I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT IT GO THEN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MY YOUNG FRIEND WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER AWAITING YOU ANDREA MADE A LOW BOW TO THE COUNT AND ENTERED THE ADJOINING ROOM MONTE CRISTO WATCHED HIM TILL HE DISAPPEARED
WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO NONE BUT THE TWO WOMEN THEMSELVES MEANTIME I WAS MAKING WHAT OBSERVATIONS MY TERROR WOULD ALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN WERE SEATED ON FORMS ALONG THE WALLS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS OF THEIR SPELLING BOOKS AT THE NEWCOMER
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE SIR REPLIED THE MAJOR NOW SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO ADDRESSING ANDREA MAKE YOUR CONFESSION TO WHOM
ON CONDITION OF RECEIVING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY BY WAY OF RANSOM YOUR FATHER DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT AND THE SUM WAS SENT TO THE FRONTIER OF PIEDMONT WITH A PASSPORT SIGNED FOR ITALY YOU WERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE I THINK
AS FOR ME YOU MUST KNOW I CANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE OUT OF LUCCA THEREFORE I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS I CAN BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FRANCE MY DEAR FATHER I HOPE YOU WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVE MY DESCENT
FASTENED BY A STRING TO A LEG OF THE TABLE AT WHICH THE DAME WAS IRONING WHILE HORRIBLE TO RELATE A DOG NOT VERY BIG BUT VERY UGLY AND BIG ENOUGH TO BE FRIGHTENED AT LAY UNDER THE TABLE WATCHING HIM I GAZED IN UTTER DISMAY
ASKED ANDREA WITH SOME UNEASINESS YES YOU WILL RECEIVE IT FROM YOUR FATHER PERSONALLY BUT LORD WILMORE WILL BE THE SECURITY FOR THE MONEY HE HAS AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR FATHER OPENED AN ACCOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH
WELL MARQUIS SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU APPEAR TO BE IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SON WHOM YOUR GOOD FORTUNE HAS RESTORED TO YOU AH YOUR EXCELLENCY I AM OVERWHELMED WITH DELIGHT AND WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS SAID MONTE CRISTO TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN
HE IS A LITTLE STIFF AND POMPOUS IN HIS MANNER AND HE IS DISFIGURED BY HIS UNIFORM BUT WHEN IT BECOMES KNOWN THAT HE HAS BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE AUSTRIAN SERVICE ALL THAT WILL BE PARDONED WE ARE NOT GENERALLY VERY SEVERE WITH THE AUSTRIANS
HE IS A MILLIONAIRE HIS INCOME IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH ANXIETY I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PLACED IN AN AGREEABLE POSITION ONE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE POSSIBLE MY DEAR SIR
YES REPLIED ANDREA WITH AN EMBARRASSED AIR I WAS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A CARRIAGE WAS TO AWAIT YOU AT NICE PRECISELY SO AND IT CONVEYED ME FROM NICE TO GENOA FROM GENOA TO TURIN
THE IRONING OF COURSE REQUIRED A FIRE TO MAKE THE IRONS HOT AND AS THE MORNING WENT ON THE SUNSHINE ON THE WALLS CONSPIRING WITH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE OLD DAME SHE WENT AND SET THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
FROM A CERTAIN ABBE BUSONI HAVE YOU ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM WHAT DID HE SAY IN THE LETTER YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO BETRAY ME REST ASSURED OF THAT YOU WELL KNOW THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME
YOU SHOULD FURNISH HIM WITH SOME OF COURSE REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
AND I AS A DUTIFUL SON AS THEY CHOOSE THAT I SHALL BE DESCENDED FROM YOU WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY THEY MA FOI I CAN HARDLY TELL BUT I WAS ALLUDING TO THOSE WHO WROTE THE LETTER YOU RECEIVED ONE DID YOU NOT YES FROM WHOM
AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING
WHY IT DOES NOT MUCH CONCERN US DO YOU THINK IT DOES NO I AGREE WITH YOU THERE WE MUST PLAY THE GAME TO THE END AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AH YOU SHALL SEE I PROMISE YOU I WILL SUSTAIN MY PART TO ADMIRATION
ONE GLORIOUS MORNING IN EARLY SUMMER I FOUND MYSELF LED BY THE UNGENTLE HAND OF MISSUS MITCHELL TOWARDS A LITTLE SCHOOL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VILLAGE KEPT BY AN OLD WOMAN CALLED MISSUS SHAND IN AN ENGLISH VILLAGE I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DAME SHAND
YOU THINK THEN THAT I MAY RELY ON THE COUNT'S PROMISES CERTAINLY I DO YOU ARE SURE HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD WITH ME TO THE LETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER WE MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY OUR RESPECTIVE PARTS I AS A TENDER FATHER
HE IS THEN THE SAME ENGLISHMAN WHOM I MET
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTED TO RENDER YOU A STRANGER TO THE WORLD IN WHICH YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR NAME ENTITLE YOU TO MAKE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE SIR RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A REASSURANCE OF MANNER
WELL MONSIEUR I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
AH YOU MAY LOOK SAID THE DAME IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY THAT IS HOW YOU SHALL BE SERVED THE DOG SHALL HAVE YOU TO LOOK AFTER I TREMBLED AND WAS SPEECHLESS AFTER SOME FURTHER CONFABULATION MISSUS MITCHELL TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING
THEN WE ARE ONCE MORE REUNITED SAID ANDREA ONCE MORE REPLIED THE MAJOR NEVER MORE TO BE SEPARATED
IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT FETCH A HIGHER PRICE IN THE ROMAN MARKET MONTE CRISTO SMILED WITH SATISFACTION
IT WAS THE SAME BOY WHO HAD BEEN TIED UNDER THE TABLE BUT HE HAD BEEN RELEASED FOR HIS LESSON THE DAME HOBBLED TO HIM AND FOUND HE HAD HIS BOOK UPSIDE DOWN WHEREUPON SHE TURNED IN WRATH TO THE TABLE AND TOOK FROM THE DRAWER A LONG LEATHER STRAP
MA FOI MONSIEUR YOU HAVE TOUCHED UPON A TENDER CHORD DO YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAYS MAJOR CERTAINLY I DO BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND I DO YOUR SON SAYS HE REQUIRES MONEY WELL WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO SAID THE MAJOR
SAID ANDREA TAKING THE MAJOR BY THE ARM IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAID FOR BEING MY FATHER THE MAJOR WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN ANDREA CONTINUED IN A LOW VOICE NONSENSE I AM GOING TO SET YOU AN EXAMPLE OF CONFIDENCE
TAKEN AWAY BY THE TREACHERY OF MY TUTOR SO THAT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE NOT SEEN THE AUTHOR OF MY EXISTENCE SINCE I HAVE ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION AND BECOME MY OWN MASTER I HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY SEEKING HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN
WITH WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO CHASTISE HIM AS HIS FIRST CRY REACHED MY EARS I WAS HALFWAY TO THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD I STUMBLED AND FELL
SHE WAS AS TALL AS MISSUS MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO PREJUDICE ME AGAINST HER AT ONCE SHE WORE A CLOSE FITTING WIDOW'S CAP WITH A BLACK RIBBON ROUND IT HER HAIR WAS GREY AND HER FACE WAS AS GREY AS HER HAIR
WILL YOU NOT EMBRACE ME SIR SAID ANDREA IF YOU WISH IT MY SON SAID THE MAJOR AND THE TWO MEN EMBRACED EACH OTHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ACTORS ON THE STAGE THAT IS TO SAY EACH RESTED HIS HEAD ON THE OTHER'S SHOULDER
AND YOU HAVE DONE WELL TO CONFORM IN EVERYTHING TO THE WISHES OF MY FRIEND SINBAD FOR YOUR FATHER IS INDEED HERE AND IS SEEKING YOU THE COUNT FROM THE MOMENT OF FIRST ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM HAD NOT ONCE LOST SIGHT OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE
BY THE MARCHESA CORSINARI AND WHO WAS TAKEN FROM YOU AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE THIS SON IS NAMED ANDREA CAVALCANTI IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT DOUBT THE KIND INTENTION OF THE WRITER OF THIS LETTER YOU WILL FIND ENCLOSED AN ORDER FOR TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FRANCS
HE WISHES TO DISCOVER IF THE FINE ABILITIES WITH WHICH NATURE HAD ENDOWED YOU HAVE BEEN WEAKENED BY WANT OF CULTURE AND IN SHORT WHETHER YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF CAPABLE OF RESUMING AND RETAINING IN THE WORLD THE HIGH POSITION TO WHICH YOUR RANK ENTITLES YOU
THE NEXT MOMENT A WHOLESOME RAGE SENT THE BLOOD TO MY BRAIN FROM ABJECT COWARDICE TO WILD ATTACK I CANNOT CALL IT COURAGE WAS THE CHANGE OF AN INSTANT I RUSHED TOWARDS THE LITTLE WRETCH I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT HIM
HE DEPUTES ME TO GIVE YOU THIS AM I TO CONSIDER THIS AS PART OF MY INCOME ON ACCOUNT NO IT IS FOR THE FIRST EXPENSES OF YOUR SETTLING IN PARIS AH HOW GOOD MY DEAR FATHER IS SILENCE SAID MONTE CRISTO
EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON WHETHER I COULD OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE SHE COULD REACH ME ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE I WAS SURE OF RUNNING FASTER THAN SHE COULD FOLLOW AND SOON I HAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF HOW THOSE ARE HELPED WHO WILL HELP THEMSELVES
SAID THE MAJOR I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I RECEIVED A LETTER ALMOST TO THE SAME EFFECT YOU YES FROM THE ABBE BUSONI NO FROM WHOM THEN
WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ME I GOT IN BUT KEPT DRAWING OUT THE STRAW BEHIND ME AND FILLING THE HOLE IN FRONT THIS I CONTINUED UNTIL I HAD NOT ONLY STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE BUT PLACED A GOOD THICKNESS OF STRAW BETWEEN ME AND THE OUTSIDE
THEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SUCH THING IN ITALY AS BEING CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS THE MAJOR DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
AS STANDING ON ONE LEG THE OTHER WAS SO MUCH SHORTER SHE MOVED IT TO AND FRO OVER THE GARMENT ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CALLED ME TO HER BY NAME IN A WOULD BE POMPOUS MANNER I OBEYED TREMBLING CAN YOU SAY YOUR LETTERS
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM FOR IT WILL BE NECESSARY HE SHOULD KNOW YOU AS HE IS TO PAY YOUR MONEY FULL DRESS SAID THE MAJOR HALF ALOUD OH YES CERTAINLY SAID THE COUNT UNIFORM CROSS KNEE BREECHES AND HOW SHALL I BE DRESSED DEMANDED ANDREA
AS FOR ME MY HEART IS OVERFLOWING WITH HAPPINESS HAPPY FATHER HAPPY SON SAID THE COUNT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WHICH GRIEVES ME OBSERVED THE MAJOR AND THAT IS THE NECESSITY FOR MY LEAVING PARIS SO SOON
INDEED HIS GRIEFS HOPES AND FEARS ON THAT SUBJECT MIGHT FURNISH MATERIAL FOR A MOST TOUCHING AND PATHETIC POEM AT LENGTH HE ONE DAY RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THAT THE ABDUCTORS OF HIS SON NOW OFFERED TO RESTORE HIM OR AT LEAST TO GIVE NOTICE WHERE HE MIGHT BE FOUND
BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
CERTAINLY I WILL DO SO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH A QUICKNESS WHICH GAVE PROOF OF HIS READY INVENTION I AM AS YOU HAVE SAID THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI SON OF MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE EXCUSED IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH ACCOMPANIED MY BIRTH AND FOLLOWED ME THROUGH MY YOUTH WELL SAID MONTE CRISTO IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE YOU WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE COUNT FOR YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND ARE THE PERSON MOST CONCERNED IN THE MATTER
THEN READ FOR YOURSELF AND THE MAJOR GAVE A LETTER INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND ANDREA READ IN A LOW VOICE
OH VERY SIMPLY BLACK TROUSERS PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WHITE WAISTCOAT EITHER A BLACK OR BLUE COAT AND A LONG CRAVAT GO TO BLIN OR VERONIQUE FOR YOUR CLOTHES BAPTISTIN WILL TELL YOU WHERE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS
BUT SAID ANDREA IF MY FATHER HAD MET ME I DOUBT IF HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ME I MUST BE SOMEWHAT ALTERED SINCE HE LAST SAW ME OH THE VOICE OF NATURE SAID MONTE CRISTO TRUE INTERRUPTED THE YOUNG MAN I HAD NOT LOOKED UPON IT IN THAT LIGHT
I WAS INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY ONE SOON OCCURRED A CLASS OF SOME FIVE OR SIX WAS READING IF READING IT COULD BE CALLED OUT OF THE BIBLE AT LENGTH IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ONE WHO BLUNDERED DREADFULLY
AT THE SAME TIME ADVANCING TOWARDS ANDREA AND SLIPPING A PACKET OF BANK NOTES INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND WHAT IS THIS IT IS FROM YOUR FATHER FROM MY FATHER YES DID YOU NOT TELL HIM JUST NOW THAT YOU WANTED MONEY WELL THEN
A DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHOSE NAMES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE GOLDEN BOOK AT FLORENCE OUR FAMILY ALTHOUGH STILL RICH FOR MY FATHER'S INCOME AMOUNTS TO HALF A MILLION HAS EXPERIENCED MANY MISFORTUNES AND I MYSELF WAS AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS
THE YOUNG MAN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE MAJOR WHO HAD RISEN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING HIM AH MY DEAR FATHER SAID ANDREA IN A LOUD VOICE IN ORDER THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HEAR HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM IS IT REALLY YOU
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU MISFORTUNES ENTIRELY BEYOND YOUR CONTROL AND WHICH IN NO DEGREE DIMINISH MY REGARD FOR YOU
YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION ADDRESSED TO ME ARE YOU NOT SAID THE COUNT I DID NOT MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE SIGNATURE SEEMED TO ME SO STRANGE THE LETTER SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR IS IT NOT EXACTLY SO
BUT MY EFFORTS WERE STILL UNAVAILING OVER A HALF MILE OR SO RENDERED WEARY BY UNWILLINGNESS I WAS LED TO THE COTTAGE DOOR
THIS IS THE KIND OF DIFFICULTY WHICH I WISHED TO REPRESENT TO YOU MY DEAR COUNT YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE RECITED YOUR TOUCHING HISTORY BEFORE IT WOULD GO FORTH TO THE WORLD AND BE DEEMED UNLIKELY AND UNNATURAL
EXCLAIMED ANDREA EVIDENTLY CHARMED WITH THE IDEA OF HIS SPEEDY DEPARTURE THEREFORE SAID MONTE CRISTO FEIGNING TO MISTAKE HIS MEANING THEREFORE I WILL NOT FOR ANOTHER INSTANT RETARD THE PLEASURE OF YOUR MEETING ARE YOU PREPARED TO EMBRACE YOUR WORTHY FATHER
AND THE SUBJECT OF UNPLEASANT REMARK I AGREE WITH YOU MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TURNING PALE AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TREMBLING BENEATH THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK OF HIS COMPANION SUCH CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT
THE MARQUIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME PAPERS WHICH WILL CERTIFY THIS FACT AND AUTHORIZE YOU TO APPEAR UNDER THAT NAME IN THE PARISIAN WORLD
THE LESS PRETENSION THERE IS IN YOUR ATTIRE THE BETTER WILL BE THE EFFECT AS YOU ARE A RICH MAN IF YOU MEAN TO BUY ANY HORSES GET THEM OF DEVEDEUX AND IF YOU PURCHASE A PHAETON GO TO BAPTISTE FOR IT AT WHAT HOUR SHALL WE COME ASKED THE YOUNG MAN ABOUT HALF PAST SIX
WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
THAT THE SEASON OF YOUR YOUTH WAS RATHER A STORMY ONE AH SAID THE COUNT WATCHING ANDREA'S COUNTENANCE I DO NOT DEMAND ANY CONFESSION FROM YOU IT IS PRECISELY TO AVOID THAT NECESSITY THAT YOUR FATHER WAS SENT FOR FROM LUCCA YOU SHALL SOON SEE HIM
CONSEQUENTLY HE MAY INDULGE HIS ECCENTRICITIES WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF THEIR RUINING HIM AND I HAVE PROMISED TO ADHERE TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS NOW SIR PRAY DO NOT BE OFFENDED AT THE QUESTION I AM ABOUT TO PUT TO YOU AS IT COMES IN THE WAY OF MY DUTY AS YOUR PATRON
AND HEREDITARY WORTH AND EVEN TO INCREASE THE VALUE IF POSSIBLE I HAVE THEREFORE RECEIVED A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AND HAVE BEEN TREATED BY THESE KIDNAPPERS VERY MUCH AS THE SLAVES WERE TREATED IN ASIA MINOR WHOSE MASTERS MADE THEM GRAMMARIANS DOCTORS AND PHILOSOPHERS
AND FOR A MAN OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE THIS PLAN IS AS EASY AS IT IS NECESSARY YOU MUST FORM HONORABLE FRIENDSHIPS AND BY THAT MEANS COUNTERACT THE PREJUDICE WHICH MAY ATTACH TO THE OBSCURITY OF YOUR FORMER LIFE ANDREA VISIBLY CHANGED COUNTENANCE
ALL WAS THE WORK OF MY THRICE ACCURSED HANDS YE WEEP UNHAPPY ONES BUT THESE ARE NOT YOUR LAST TEARS AGAIN SHALL YOU RAISE THE FUNERAL WAIL AND THE SOUND OF YOUR LAMENTATIONS SHALL AGAIN AND AGAIN BE HEARD FRANKENSTEIN
BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE
WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
I COULD NOT ANSWER NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT I TRULY THANK HIM
BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE
MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED
BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
ITS DEPARTURE TWO YEARS HAD NOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE AND WAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD A DEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY
I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MY CHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSED GUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MY INNOCENCE
ELIZABETH ALSO SUFFERED EXTREME ANGUISH ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING I DISCOVERED MY LOVELY BOY WHOM THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SEEN BLOOMING AND ACTIVE IN HEALTH STRETCHED ON THE GRASS LIVID AND MOTIONLESS
AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLY IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING
THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW
I WEPT LIKE A CHILD DEAR MOUNTAINS MY OWN BEAUTIFUL LAKE HOW DO YOU WELCOME YOUR WANDERER YOUR SUMMITS ARE CLEAR THE SKY AND LAKE ARE BLUE AND PLACID IS THIS TO PROGNOSTICATE PEACE OR TO MOCK AT MY UNHAPPINESS
HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
I SOON SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN IN HEAVEN WHERE WE SHALL ALL BE HAPPY AND THAT CONSOLES ME GOING AS I AM TO SUFFER IGNOMINY AND DEATH OH JUSTINE
THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
AND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSED AVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMAN BUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM SHE PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD
BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION
SHE INDEED GAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THE NEVER DYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE OR CONSOLATION ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY
AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THE CHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINED AGAINST HER
I WAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSO JOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HER VOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS
FAREWELL SWEET LADY DEAREST ELIZABETH MY BELOVED AND ONLY FRIEND MAY HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY BLESS AND PRESERVE YOU MAY THIS BE THE LAST MISFORTUNE THAT YOU WILL EVER SUFFER LIVE AND BE HAPPY
CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT
I HURRIED INTO A CABRIOLET AND BADE FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND MY JOURNEY WAS VERY MELANCHOLY AT FIRST I WISHED TO HURRY ON FOR I LONGED TO CONSOLE AND SYMPATHISE WITH MY LOVED AND SORROWING FRIENDS BUT WHEN I DREW NEAR MY NATIVE TOWN
I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
THIS WAS A DIRE BLOW TO POOR ELIZABETH
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE INDEED WHO WOULD CREDIT THAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILY COULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIME JUSTINE MORITZ
THUS SPOKE MY PROPHETIC SOUL AS TORN BY REMORSE HORROR AND DESPAIR I BEHELD THOSE I LOVED SPEND VAIN SORROW UPON THE GRAVES OF WILLIAM AND JUSTINE
HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT
A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY THE SKY WAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE TOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS
I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORM INCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH OVER MY HEAD IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALEVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OF SAVOY
HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER THE SERVANT INSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITION JUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED
AND MAKE OTHERS SO AND ON THE MORROW JUSTINE DIED ELIZABETH'S HEART RENDING ELOQUENCE FAILED TO MOVE THE JUDGES FROM THEIR SETTLED CONVICTION IN THE CRIMINALITY OF THE SAINTLY SUFFERER
TO SHED COUNTLESS TEARS HAPPY BEYOND HIS HOPES IF THUS INEXORABLE FATE BE SATISFIED AND IF THE DESTRUCTION PAUSE BEFORE THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE HAVE SUCCEEDED TO YOUR SAD TORMENTS
SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER
I KNOW THE MURDERER JUSTINE POOR GOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE
SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED
AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND HER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL
HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD
A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HER COUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED SURPRISE
BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE
I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
WE MUST RESERVE THAT FOR HIS MISERABLE SURVIVORS CLERVAL SPOKE THUS AS WE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS THE WORDS IMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND AND I REMEMBERED THEM AFTERWARDS IN SOLITUDE BUT NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSES ARRIVED
CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRST EXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS
ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT
I CONFESSED THAT I MIGHT OBTAIN ABSOLUTION BUT NOW THAT FALSEHOOD LIES HEAVIER AT MY HEART THAN ALL MY OTHER SINS THE GOD OF HEAVEN FORGIVE ME EVER SINCE I WAS CONDEMNED MY CONFESSOR HAS BESIEGED ME
GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME
UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELF FROM THE PRECEDING FLASH THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS THE MOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THE LAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE
MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCED TO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN THE GATES WERE OPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
HE NOW SLEEPS WITH HIS ANGEL MOTHER WHO THAT HAD SEEN HIM BRIGHT AND JOYOUS IN HIS YOUNG BEAUTY BUT MUST WEEP OVER HIS UNTIMELY LOSS TO DIE SO MISERABLY TO FEEL THE MURDERER'S GRASP HOW MUCH MORE A MURDERED THAT COULD DESTROY RADIANT INNOCENCE POOR LITTLE FELLOW
THAT WILLIAM HAD RUN AWAY TO HIDE HIMSELF AND THAT HE VAINLY SOUGHT FOR HIM
YOUR DISASTER IS IRREPARABLE
NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS
IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE
IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND MY BROTHER IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAY IT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE MARKET WOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING
WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME
WHEN SHE AGAIN LIVED IT WAS ONLY TO WEEP AND SIGH SHE TOLD ME THAT THAT SAME EVENING WILLIAM HAD TEASED HER TO LET HIM WEAR A VERY VALUABLE MINIATURE THAT SHE POSSESSED OF YOUR MOTHER THIS PICTURE IS GONE
OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THE JEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOON I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FOR HOPE
THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL DO NOT FEAR I WILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE I WILL MELT THE STONY HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES
HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLY EXPRESSED SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WAS DESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLE
JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUT WHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HER PRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HER CHARACTER
JUSTINE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW WHO IT WAS SHE APPROACHED ME AND SAID DEAR SIR
YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US
WHAT COULD IT MEAN HAD MY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS I HASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD
BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
WHO COULD ATTEMPT TO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THE WINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAIN STREAM WITH A STRAW
AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELING BY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALE BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THE SENTIMENT OF PITY
AND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLE WILLIAM SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALL BE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCE OF HER ACQUITTAL
NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL
RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE
THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK
AND AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED SOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMED GOOD GOD PAPA
HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET
THE POOR VICTIM WHO ON THE MORROW WAS TO PASS THE AWFUL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FELT NOT AS I DID SUCH DEEP AND BITTER AGONY I GNASHED MY TEETH AND GROUND THEM TOGETHER
WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF
DURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOM WHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME DESPAIR WHO DARED TALK OF THAT
AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MY SWEET LADY
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AFFLICTED FATHER ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN GENEVA MAY TWELFTH
YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS
I ATTEMPTED TO PREVENT HER BUT SHE PERSISTED AND ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE IT LAY HASTILY EXAMINED THE NECK OF THE VICTIM AND CLASPING HER HANDS EXCLAIMED O GOD I HAVE MURDERED MY DARLING CHILD SHE FAINTED AND WAS RESTORED WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY
MY DEAR VICTOR YOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OF YOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEW LINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU
THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BE ASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR A MOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE
WHEN ELIZABETH CONJECTURED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE HE WAS NOT THERE WE RETURNED AGAIN WITH TORCHES FOR I COULD NOT REST WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY SWEET BOY HAD LOST HIMSELF AND WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE DAMPS AND DEWS OF NIGHT
I ENQUIRED MORE MINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOT CONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE
HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER
THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE
WHO HAD GONE ON BEFORE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND WE ACCORDINGLY RESTED ON A SEAT UNTIL THEY SHOULD RETURN PRESENTLY ERNEST CAME AND ENQUIRED IF WE HAD SEEN HIS BROTHER HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HIM
AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MY INNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF
AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME
HE THREATENED AND MENACED UNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID I WAS HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IF I CONTINUED OBDURATE
I WANDERED ON WITH A HASTY STEP THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MY HANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL
JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAID THAT PANG IS PAST GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TO ENDURE THE WORST
SHE MOST OF ALL SAID ERNEST REQUIRES CONSOLATION SHE ACCUSED HERSELF OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF MY BROTHER AND THAT MADE HER VERY WRETCHED BUT SINCE THE MURDERER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THE MURDERER DISCOVERED GOOD GOD HOW CAN THAT BE
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT
I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS
AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM
BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
AS HE WHO GOETH YONDER UNDERTOOK THAT HE MIGHT GAIN THE LADY OF THE HERD TO COUNTERFEIT IN HIMSELF BUOSO DONATI MAKING A WILL AND GIVING IT DUE FORM AND AFTER THE TWO MANIACS HAD PASSED ON WHOM I HELD MINE EYE
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
AND HE TO ME THAT IS THE ANCIENT GHOST OF THE NEFARIOUS MYRRHA WHO BECAME BEYOND ALL RIGHTFUL LOVE HER FATHER'S LOVER SHE CAME TO SIN WITH HIM AFTER THIS MANNER BY COUNTERFEITING OF ANOTHER'S FORM
AND NOT WITH SARACENS NOR WITH THE JEWS FOR EACH ONE OF HIS ENEMIES WAS CHRISTIAN AND NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN TO CONQUER ACRE NOR MERCHANDISING IN THE SULTAN'S LAND NOR THE HIGH OFFICE NOR THE SACRED ORDERS IN HIM REGARDED
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONSENTS NOT O MISERABLE ME HOW I DID SHUDDER WHEN HE SEIZED ON ME SAYING PERADVENTURE THOU DIDST NOT THINK THAT I WAS A LOGICIAN HE BORE ME UNTO MINOS
WHOLLY TO ME DID THE GOOD MASTER GATHER SAYING SAY UNTO THEM WHATE'ER THOU WISHEST AND I BEGAN SINCE HE WOULD HAVE IT SO SO MAY YOUR MEMORY NOT STEAL AWAY IN THE FIRST WORLD FROM OUT THE MINDS OF MEN
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
FIVE TIMES REKINDLED AND AS MANY QUENCHED HAD BEEN THE SPLENDOUR UNDERNEATH THE MOON SINCE WE HAD ENTERED INTO THE DEEP PASS WHEN THERE APPEARED TO US A MOUNTAIN DIM FROM DISTANCE
TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
AND TO LICK UP THE MIRROR OF NARCISSUS THOU WOULDST NOT WANT WORDS MANY TO INVITE THEE
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
NOW GO THY WAY NO MORE I URGE THEE BECAUSE I COME PERCHANCE A LITTLE LATE TO STAY AND SPEAK WITH ME LET IT NOT IRK THEE THOU SEEST IT IRKS NOT ME AND I AM BURNING
AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
WHEN LIFELESS SHE BEHELD POLYXENA AND OF HER POLYDORUS ON THE SHORE OF OCEAN WAS THE DOLOROUS ONE AWARE OUT OF HER SENSES LIKE A DOG SHE BARKED SO MUCH THE ANGUISH HAD HER MIND DISTORTED
BUT INASMUCH AS NEVER FROM THIS DEPTH DID ANY ONE RETURN IF I HEAR TRUE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INFAMY I ANSWER I WAS A MAN OF ARMS THEN CORDELIER BELIEVING THUS BEGIRT TO MAKE AMENDS AND TRULY MY BELIEF HAD BEEN FULFILLED
AND THEY WERE TWO IN ONE AND ONE IN TWO
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
BENEATH THE GREEN PAWS FINDS ITSELF AGAIN VERRUCCHIO'S ANCIENT MASTIFF AND THE NEW
WHERE THOU WAST QUESTIONED OF THE TRUTH AT TROY IF I SPAKE FALSE THOU FALSIFIEDST THE COIN SAID SINON AND FOR ONE FAULT I AM HERE AND THOU FOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEMON
I TURNED IT BACK TO LOOK UPON THE OTHER EVIL BORN I SAW ONE MADE IN FASHION OF A LUTE IF HE HAD ONLY HAD THE GROIN CUT OFF JUST AT THE POINT AT WHICH A MAN IS FORKED THE HEAVY DROPSY
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
AND ALBERT OF SIENA HAD ME BURNED BUT WHAT I DIED FOR DOES NOT BRING ME HERE TIS TRUE I SAID TO HIM SPEAKING IN JEST THAT I COULD RISE BY FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AND HE WHO HAD CONCEIT BUT LITTLE WIT WOULD HAVE ME SHOW TO HIM THE ART AND ONLY BECAUSE NO DAEDALUS I MADE HIM
AND ALL THE REST WHOSE BONES ARE GATHERED STILL AT CEPERANO WHERE A RENEGADE WAS EACH APULIAN AND AT TAGLIACOZZO WHERE WITHOUT ARMS THE OLD ALARDO CONQUERED AND ONE HIS LIMB TRANSPIERCED AND ONE LOPPED OFF
THE CITIES OF LAMONE AND SANTERNO GOVERNS THE LIONCEL OF THE WHITE LAIR WHO CHANGES SIDES TWIXT SUMMER TIME AND WINTER AND THAT OF WHICH THE SAVIO BATHES THE FLANK EVEN AS IT LIES BETWEEN THE PLAIN AND MOUNTAIN
THE SAME WHO GAVE TO THE YOUNG KING THE EVIL COMFORT I MADE THE FATHER AND THE SON REBELLIOUS
LYING THERE CLOSE UPON THY RIGHT HAND CONFINES I FOUND THEM HERE REPLIED HE WHEN I RAINED INTO THIS CHASM AND SINCE THEY HAVE NOT TURNED NOR DO I THINK THEY WILL FOR EVERMORE ONE THE FALSE WOMAN IS WHO ACCUSED JOSEPH
IF I WERE ONLY STILL SO LIGHT THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS I COULD ADVANCE ONE INCH I HAD ALREADY STARTED ON THE WAY SEEKING HIM OUT AMONG THIS SQUALID FOLK ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE ELEVEN MILES AND BE NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE ACROSS
BUT SO MAY IT SURVIVE NEATH MANY SUNS SAY TO ME WHO YE ARE AND OF WHAT PEOPLE LET NOT YOUR FOUL AND LOATHSOME PUNISHMENT MAKE YOU AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELVES TO ME
WHEN NOW THE FLAME HAD COME UNTO THAT POINT WHERE TO MY LEADER IT SEEMED TIME AND PLACE AFTER THIS FASHION DID I HEAR HIM SPEAK O YE WHO ARE TWOFOLD WITHIN ONE FIRE IF I DESERVED OF YOU WHILE I WAS LIVING
FOR BRANDA'S FOUNT I WOULD NOT GIVE THE SIGHT ONE IS WITHIN ALREADY IF THE RAVING SHADES THAT ARE GOING ROUND ABOUT SPEAK TRUTH BUT WHAT AVAILS IT ME WHOSE LIMBS ARE TIED
WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
WITH THE OTHER BURTHEN DROWNED HERSELF AND AT THE TIME WHEN FORTUNE DOWNWARD HURLED THE TROJAN'S ARROGANCE THAT ALL THINGS DARED SO THAT THE KING WAS WITH HIS KINGDOM CRUSHED HECUBA SAD DISCONSOLATE AND CAPTIVE
LEAVE ME TO SPEAK BECAUSE I HAVE CONCEIVED THAT WHICH THOU WISHEST FOR THEY MIGHT DISDAIN PERCHANCE SINCE THEY WERE GREEKS DISCOURSE OF THINE
EVER BEFORE ME STAND AND NOT IN VAIN FOR FAR MORE DOTH THEIR IMAGE DRY ME UP THAN THE DISEASE WHICH STRIPS MY FACE OF FLESH THE RIGID JUSTICE THAT CHASTISES ME DRAWETH OCCASION FROM THE PLACE IN WHICH I SINNED
STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
I TURNED ME ROUND TOWARDS HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT STILL IT EDDIES THROUGH MY MEMORY AND AS HE IS WHO DREAMS OF HIS OWN HARM WHO DREAMING WISHES IT MAY BE A DREAM SO THAT HE CRAVES WHAT IS AS IF IT WERE NOT SUCH I BECAME
AND NOW DEPARTED FROM US WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENTLE POET WHEN YET ANOTHER WHICH BEHIND IT CAME CAUSED US TO TURN OUR EYES UPON ITS TOP BY A CONFUSED SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM IT
AMONG THE THIEVES FIVE CITIZENS OF THINE LIKE THESE I FOUND WHENCE SHAME COMES UNTO ME AND THOU THEREBY TO NO GREAT HONOUR RISEST BUT IF WHEN MORN IS NEAR OUR DREAMS ARE TRUE
HOW MUTILATED SEE IS MAHOMET IN FRONT OF ME DOTH ALI WEEPING GO CLEFT IN THE FACE FROM FORELOCK UNTO CHIN AND ALL THE OTHERS WHOM THOU HERE BEHOLDEST DISSEMINATORS OF SCANDAL AND OF SCHISM WHILE LIVING WERE
BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
BEHOLD IF ANY BE AS GREAT AS THIS AND SO THAT THOU MAY CARRY NEWS OF ME
AND BY THE HAIR IT HELD THE HEAD DISSEVERED HUNG FROM THE HAND IN FASHION OF A LANTERN AND THAT UPON US GAZED AND SAID O ME IT OF ITSELF MADE TO ITSELF A LAMP
BECAUSE I PARTED PERSONS SO UNITED PARTED DO I NOW BEAR MY BRAIN ALAS FROM ITS BEGINNING WHICH IS IN THIS TRUNK
FROM ACUTE FEVER THEY SEND FORTH SUCH REEK AND ONE OF THEM WHO FELT HIMSELF ANNOYED AT BEING PERADVENTURE NAMED SO DARKLY SMOTE WITH THE FIST UPON HIS HARDENED PAUNCH IT GAVE A SOUND AS IF IT WERE A DRUM
AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
CONSIDER IF TO COUNT THEM THOU BELIEVEST THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS AND NOW THE MOON IS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET HENCEFORTH THE TIME ALLOTTED US IS BRIEF AND MORE IS TO BE SEEN THAN WHAT THOU SEEST
WE STEP BY STEP WENT ONWARD WITHOUT SPEECH GAZING UPON AND LISTENING TO THE SICK WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIFT THEIR BODIES I SAW TWO SITTING LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS LEANS IN HEATING PLATTER AGAINST PLATTER
HIS HEART WAS VISIBLE AND THE DISMAL SACK THAT MAKETH EXCREMENT OF WHAT IS EATEN WHILE I WAS ALL ABSORBED IN SEEING HIM HE LOOKED AT ME AND OPENED WITH HIS HANDS HIS BOSOM SAYING
AND MASTER ADAM SMOTE HIM IN THE FACE WITH ARM THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BE LESS HARD SAYING TO HIM ALTHOUGH BE TAKEN FROM ME ALL MOTION FOR MY LIMBS THAT HEAVY ARE I HAVE AN ARM UNFETTERED FOR SUCH NEED WHEREAT HE ANSWER MADE
THEREFORE THYSELF DISBURDEN OF ALL SADNESS AND MAKE ACCOUNT THAT I AM AYE BESIDE THEE IF E'ER IT COME TO PASS THAT FORTUNE BRING THEE WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A LIKE DISPUTE
SO MAY THY NAILS SUFFICE THEE TO ALL ETERNITY UNTO THIS WORK LATIANS ARE WE WHOM THOU SO WASTED SEEST BOTH OF US HERE ONE WEEPING MADE REPLY BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTIONEST ABOUT US AND SAID THE GUIDE
HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
O BROTHERS WHO AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND PERILS I SAID HAVE COME UNTO THE WEST TO THIS SO INCONSIDERABLE VIGIL WHICH IS REMAINING OF YOUR SENSES
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
AND THEREFORE ARE CLEFT THUS A DEVIL IS BEHIND HERE WHO DOTH CLEAVE US THUS CRUELLY
AND THIS IS TRUE AS THAT I SPEAK TO THEE MORE THAN A HUNDRED WERE THERE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM WHO IN THE MOAT STOOD STILL TO LOOK AT ME THROUGH WONDERMENT OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR TORTURE
THREE TIMES IT MADE HER WHIRL WITH ALL THE WATERS AT THE FOURTH TIME IT MADE THE STERN UPLIFT AND THE PROW DOWNWARD GO AS PLEASED ANOTHER
NOR IN ME THAT CORD WHICH USED TO MAKE THOSE GIRT WITH IT MORE MEAGRE BUT EVEN AS CONSTANTINE SOUGHT OUT SYLVESTER TO CURE HIS LEPROSY WITHIN SORACTE SO THIS ONE SOUGHT ME OUT AS AN ADEPT
AFTER THE FIRE A LITTLE MORE HAD ROARED IN ITS OWN FASHION THE SHARP POINT IT MOVED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THEN GAVE FORTH SUCH BREATH
FOR THEM AM I IN SUCH A FAMILY THEY DID INDUCE ME INTO COINING FLORINS WHICH HAD THREE CARATS OF IMPURITY AND I TO HIM WHO ARE THE TWO POOR WRETCHES THAT SMOKE LIKE UNTO A WET HAND IN WINTER
AND RAVING GOES THUS HARRYING OTHER PEOPLE O SAID I TO HIM SO MAY NOT THE OTHER SET TEETH ON THEE LET IT NOT WEARY THEE TO TELL US WHO IT IS ERE IT DART HENCE
LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
AND WHERE HIS WIT THE ABBAGLIATO PROFFERED BUT THAT THOU KNOW WHO THUS DOTH SECOND THEE AGAINST THE SIENESE MAKE SHARP THINE EYE TOW'RDS ME SO THAT MY FACE WELL ANSWER THEE
A CASK BY LOSING CENTRE PIECE OR CANT WAS NEVER SHATTERED SO AS I SAW ONE RENT FROM THE CHIN TO WHERE ONE BREAKETH WIND
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
TO PUT THE MORE MY SIGHS IN FLIGHT THERE IS ROMENA WHERE I COUNTERFEITED THE CURRENCY IMPRINTED WITH THE BAPTIST FOR WHICH I LEFT MY BODY BURNED ABOVE
WERE LAMENTING FOR THEIR BLOOD SHED BY THE ROMANS AND THE LINGERING WAR THAT OF THE RINGS MADE SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS SPOILS AS LIVY HAS RECORDED WHO ERRS NOT
AND THOU SHALT SEE I AM CAPOCCHIO'S SHADE WHO METALS FALSIFIED BY ALCHEMY THOU MUST REMEMBER IF I WELL DESCRY THEE
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
FOR I WAS FROM THE MOUNTAINS THERE BETWEEN URBINO AND THE YOKE WHENCE TIBER BURSTS I STILL WAS DOWNWARD BENT AND LISTENING WHEN MY CONDUCTOR TOUCHED ME ON THE SIDE SAYING SPEAK THOU
WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING
THAT THEY WERE WISHFUL TO STAND STILL AND WEEP BUT SAID VIRGILIUS WHAT DOST THOU STILL GAZE AT
THE PROMISE LONG WITH THE FULFILMENT SHORT WILL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT FRANCIS CAME AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS DEAD FOR ME BUT ONE OF THE BLACK CHERUBIM SAID TO HIM TAKE HIM NOT DO ME NO WRONG
BY REASON THAT OUR WOUNDS ARE CLOSED AGAIN ERE ANY ONE IN FRONT OF HIM REPASS BUT WHO ART THOU THAT MUSEST ON THE CRAG PERCHANCE TO POSTPONE GOING TO THE PAIN THAT IS ADJUDGED UPON THINE ACCUSATIONS
I HAD WHILE LIVING MUCH OF WHAT I WISHED AND NOW ALAS A DROP OF WATER CRAVE
IF THOU HADST I MADE ANSWER THEREUPON ATTENDED TO THE CAUSE FOR WHICH I LOOKED PERHAPS A LONGER STAY THOU WOULDST HAVE PARDONED MEANWHILE MY GUIDE DEPARTED
WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
AND VESTED THUS IN GOING I BEMOAN ME
AND PAIN FOR THE PALLADIUM THERE IS BORNE IF THEY WITHIN THOSE SPARKS POSSESS THE POWER TO SPEAK I SAID THEE MASTER MUCH I PRAY AND RE PRAY THAT THE PRAYER BE WORTH A THOUSAND
HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD I MAY MYSELF NOT GRUDGE IT AS MANY AS THE HIND WHO ON THE HILL RESTS AT THE TIME WHEN HE WHO LIGHTS THE WORLD HIS COUNTENANCE KEEPS LEAST CONCEALED FROM US WHILE AS THE FLY GIVES PLACE UNTO THE GNAT
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT BELLOWED FIRST WITH THE LAMENT OF HIM AND THAT WAS RIGHT WHO WITH HIS FILE HAD MODULATED IT BELLOWED SO WITH THE VOICE OF THE AFFLICTED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS MADE OF BRASS
REMOUNTED MY CONDUCTOR AND DREW ME AND FOLLOWING THE SOLITARY PATH AMONG THE ROCKS AND RIDGES OF THE CRAG THE FOOT WITHOUT THE HAND SPED NOT AT ALL THEN SORROWED I
AND EVERY FLAME A SINNER STEALS AWAY I STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE UPRISEN TO SEE SO THAT IF I HAD SEIZED NOT ON A ROCK DOWN HAD I FALLEN WITHOUT BEING PUSHED AND THE LEADER WHO BEHELD ME SO ATTENT EXCLAIMED
WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
THUS DID WE SPEAK AS FAR AS THE FIRST PLACE UPON THE CRAG WHICH THE NEXT VALLEY SHOWS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IF THERE WERE MORE LIGHT WHEN WE WERE NOW RIGHT OVER THE LAST CLOISTER OF MALEBOLGE SO THAT ITS LAY BROTHERS COULD MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTO OUR SIGHT
ONE AM I WHO DESCENDS DOWN WITH THIS LIVING MAN FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF AND I INTEND TO SHOW HELL UNTO HIM THEN BROKEN WAS THEIR MUTUAL SUPPORT AND TREMBLING EACH ONE TURNED HIMSELF TO ME WITH OTHERS WHO HAD HEARD HIM BY REBOUND
AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
THAT SO DISPROPORTIONS THE LIMBS WITH HUMOURS WHICH IT ILL CONCOCTS THAT THE FACE CORRESPONDS NOT TO THE BELLY COMPELLED HIM SO TO HOLD HIS LIPS APART AS DOES THE HECTIC WHO BECAUSE OF THIRST ONE TOW'RDS THE CHIN
JOYFUL WERE WE AND SOON IT TURNED TO WEEPING FOR OUT OF THE NEW LAND A WHIRLWIND ROSE AND SMOTE UPON THE FORE PART OF THE SHIP
THE STUMPS UPLIFTING THROUGH THE MURKY AIR SO THAT THE BLOOD MADE HORRIBLE HIS FACE CRIED OUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER MOSCA ALSO WHO SAID ALAS A THING DONE HAS AN END WHICH WAS AN ILL SEED FOR THE TUSCAN PEOPLE
STILL BE YE UNWILLING TO DENY THE KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING THE SUN OF THE UNPEOPLED WORLD CONSIDER YE THE SEED FROM WHICH YE SPRANG YE WERE NOT MADE TO LIVE LIKE UNTO BRUTES
WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
IF THOU BUT LATELY INTO THIS BLIND WORLD HAST FALLEN DOWN FROM THAT SWEET LATIAN LAND WHEREFROM I BRING THE WHOLE OF MY TRANSGRESSION SAY IF THE ROMAGNUOLS HAVE PEACE OR WAR
AND I TO HIM SHOW TO ME AND DECLARE IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME BEAR UP NEWS OF THEE WHO IS THIS PERSON OF THE BITTER VISION THEN DID HE LAY HIS HAND UPON THE JAW OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND HIS MOUTH OPED CRYING
MY MASTER I REPLIED BY HEARING THEE I AM MORE SURE BUT I SURMISED ALREADY IT MIGHT BE SO AND ALREADY WISHED TO ASK THEE WHO IS WITHIN THAT FIRE WHICH COMES SO CLEFT AT TOP
AGAINST THE THEBAN BLOOD AS SHE ALREADY MORE THAN ONCE HAD SHOWN SO REFT OF REASON ATHAMAS BECAME THAT SEEING HIS OWN WIFE WITH CHILDREN TWAIN WALKING ENCUMBERED UPON EITHER HAND HE CRIED
AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
BITING IN THE MANNER RAN ALONG THAT A BOAR DOES WHEN FROM THE STY TURNED LOOSE ONE TO CAPOCCHIO CAME AND BY THE NAPE SEIZED WITH ITS TEETH HIS NECK
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
NEPTUNE NE'ER YET BEHELD SO GREAT A CRIME NEITHER OF PIRATES NOR ARGOLIC PEOPLE THAT TRAITOR WHO SEES ONLY WITH ONE EYE AND HOLDS THE LAND WHICH SOME ONE HERE WITH ME WOULD FAIN BE FASTING FROM THE VISION OF
BEGAN TO WAVE ITSELF ABOUT EVEN AS A FLAME DOTH WHICH THE WIND FATIGUES THEREAFTERWARD THE SUMMIT TO AND FRO MOVING AS IF IT WERE THE TONGUE THAT SPAKE IT UTTERED FORTH A VOICE AND SAID
WHICH NO OTHER SUCCOUR HAD AND THE NAILS DOWNWARD WITH THEM DRAGGED THE SCAB IN FASHION AS A KNIFE THE SCALES OF BREAM OR ANY OTHER FISH THAT HAS THEM LARGEST
TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
IF I DESERVED OF YOU OR MUCH OR LITTLE WHEN IN THE WORLD I WROTE THE LOFTY VERSES DO NOT MOVE ON BUT ONE OF YOU DECLARE WHITHER BEING LOST HE WENT AWAY TO DIE THEN OF THE ANTIQUE FLAME THE GREATER HORN MURMURING
THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
SPREAD OUT THE NETS THAT I MAY TAKE THE LIONESS AND HER WHELPS UPON THE PASSAGE AND THEN EXTENDED HIS UNPITYING CLAWS SEIZING THE FIRST WHO HAD THE NAME LEARCHUS AND WHIRLED HIM ROUND AND DASHED HIM ON A ROCK AND SHE
AND I WHO HAD BEFOREHAND MY REPLY IN READINESS FORTHWITH BEGAN TO SPEAK O SOUL THAT DOWN BELOW THERE ART CONCEALED ROMAGNA THINE IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITHOUT WAR IN THE BOSOM OF ITS TYRANTS
AND NEVER SAW I PLIED A CURRYCOMB BY STABLE BOY FOR WHOM HIS MASTER WAITS OR HIM WHO KEEPS AWAKE UNWILLINGLY AS EVERY ONE WAS PLYING FAST THE BITE OF NAILS UPON HIMSELF FOR THE GREAT RAGE OF ITCHING
AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
AND ALL THE ANIMALS ON THE SHIP BEGAN TO LAUGH AND DANCE ABOUT IN THE RUSHING AIR FOR WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE PIRATES SHIP THEY COULD SEE THAT IT WAS GROWING SMALLER NOW INSTEAD OF BIGGER
POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
GO TO HIM BRAVE BUMPO SECRETLY WHEN THE SUN HAS SET AND BEHOLD THOU SHALT BE MADE THE WHITEST PRINCE THAT EVER WON FAIR LADY
THE SLOWEST HE COULD FIND I SHOULD THINK MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WIN A RACE IN A SOUP TUREEN AS HOPE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM
THIS COAST IS THE SEASHORE OF THE GREAT DESERT IT IS A WILD LONELY PLACE ALL SAND AND STONES AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE BARBARY PIRATES LIVED THESE PIRATES A BAD LOT OF MEN
WAS SO THICK WITH BUSHES AND CREEPERS AND VINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY COULD HARDLY MOVE AT ALL AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO TAKE OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT HIS WAY ALONG
THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF GETTING OUT THEN GUB GUB BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN ALL THIS TIME POLYNESIA WAS STILL SITTING IN THE TREE IN THE PALACE GARDEN
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW COME OVER HERE BY THE LIGHT OH BUT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST GO DOWN TO THE BEACH AND GET A SHIP READY WITH FOOD IN IT TO TAKE ME ACROSS THE SEA
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
AND FETCH ME ALL THE SAILS YOU SEE THE DOG HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS AND DRAGGED UP EVERY SAIL HE COULD FIND BUT EVEN WHEN ALL THESE WERE PUT UP ON THE MASTS TO CATCH THE WIND
SHE WAS SAYING NOTHING AND BLINKING HER EYES THIS WAS ALWAYS A VERY BAD SIGN WITH POLYNESIA WHENEVER SHE SAID NOTHING AND BLINKED HER EYES
GETTING THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH MUD THEY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE KING'S BACK GARDEN BY MISTAKE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUNNING UP AT ONCE AND CAUGHT THEM
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE GOING ON ALONE POLYNESIA SAID WE MUST TREAD SOFTLY AND TALK LOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE LAND OF THE JOLLIGINKI
THAT FOR A LITTLE THEY COVERED THE WHOLE MOON SO IT COULD NOT SHINE AND THE SEA GREW DARK AND BLACK LIKE WHEN A STORM CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN
THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
LIKE THIS AT SEA THEY WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING ON IT AND AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN THE PEOPLE OFF THEY WOULD SINK THE SHIP AND SAIL BACK TO BARBARY SINGING SONGS AND FEELING PROUD OF THE MISCHIEF THEY HAD DONE
GOT LOST IN THE DEEP WOODS THEY WANDERED AROUND AND AROUND BUT COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE SEASHORE CHEE CHEE WHEN HE COULD NOT SEE THEM ANYWHERE WAS TERRIBLY UPSET
AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
SPREAD THICK WELL THAT NIGHT PRINCE BUMPO CAME SECRETLY TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHITE MAN I AM AN UNHAPPY PRINCE YEARS AGO
AND FLEW OFF PULLING THE BOAT ALONG AND ALTHOUGH SWALLOWS ARE NOT VERY STRONG WHEN ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE BY THEMSELVES IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THERE ARE A GREAT LOT OF THEM TOGETHER
NOW ONE SUNSHINY DAY THE DOCTOR AND DAB DAB WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE SHIP FOR EXERCISE A NICE FRESH WIND WAS BLOWING THE BOAT ALONG AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
USED TO WAIT FOR SAILORS TO BE SHIPWRECKED ON THEIR SHORES AND OFTEN IF THEY SAW A BOAT PASSING THEY WOULD COME OUT IN THEIR FAST SAILING SHIPS AND CHASE IT WHEN THEY CAUGHT A BOAT
AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
TRYING TO SNIFF THE COOKING SMELLS THAT CAME FROM THE PALACE KITCHEN SHE TOLD THE PIG TO BRING THE DOCTOR TO THE WINDOW BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM SO GUB GUB WENT AND WOKE THE DOCTOR
HE GROWLED THE WORST MEN I EVER SMELT I SMELL TROUBLE I SMELL A FIGHT SIX BAD SCOUNDRELS FIGHTING AGAINST ONE BRAVE MAN I WANT TO HELP HIM
THE KING'S SON LAID THE BOOK DOWN AND SIGHED A WEARY SIGH IF I WERE ONLY A WHITE PRINCE SAID HE WITH A DREAMY FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS EYES THEN THE PARROT
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
CATCHING HIM AND BRINGING HIM BACK THAT I TURNED TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SWAMP SH LOOK THERE'S PRINCE BUMPO COMING INTO THE GARDEN HE MUST NOT SEE US
THE LAND WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND WHEN THE DOCTOR STOOD UPON THE BOAT HE LOOKED OVER THE SIDE ACROSS THE WATER AND THEN HE REMEMBERED
AS SOON AS THEY HAD ALL FOUND A PLACE TO SIT SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO NOISE LEFT ANYWHERE ALL WAS QUIET ALL WAS STILL AND IN THE SILENT MOONLIGHT
BUT POLYNESIA FLEW INTO A TREE IN THE GARDEN WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING HER AND HID HERSELF
I SUPPOSE HE IS SAID DAB DAB ALL DOGS CAN SMELL IN THEIR SLEEP BUT WHAT IS HE SMELLING ASKED THE DOCTOR THERE IS NO ROAST BEEF COOKING ON OUR SHIP NO
IT WAS ALL THAT STUPID PIG'S FAULT SAID POLYNESIA HE WOULD KEEP RUNNING OFF THE PATH HUNTING FOR GINGER ROOTS AND I WAS KEPT SO BUSY
AND BLUNDERED INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BY MISTAKE BUT COULDN'T YOU GUIDE THEM ASKED CHEE CHEE AND HE BEGAN TO SCOLD THE PARROT FOR LETTING THEM GET LOST WHILE HE WAS AWAY LOOKING FOR THE COCOANUTS
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
BUT THE DOCTOR ASKED HIM NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IT AND WHEN HE HAD CLOSED HIS MEDICINE BAG IN A HURRY HE TOLD HIM TO OPEN THE PRISON DOOR
MOST LIKELY HE WILL BE AS BLACK AS EVER WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE THE MIRROR WITH HIM BUT THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT STAY WHITE I HAD NEVER USED THAT MIXTURE BEFORE
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES THAT SPEAK TO THEE I AM HIDING IN A ROSE BUD OH TELL ME FAIRY QUEEN CRIED BUMPO CLASPING HIS HANDS IN JOY
WERE NEARLY ALWAYS SORRY FOR IT AFTERWARDS PRESENTLY SHE SPIED CHEE CHEE SWINGING THROUGH THE TREES STILL LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR WHEN CHEE CHEE SAW HER HE CAME INTO HER TREE
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH
YOU ASK HIM THEN JIP STILL FAST ASLEEP BEGAN TO GROWL AGAIN AND HIS LIP CURLED UP ANGRILY SHOWING HIS CLEAN WHITE TEETH I SMELL BAD MEN
THE WIDE WIDE SEA LOOKED TERRIBLY BIG AND LONESOME IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR WAY WHEN THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
JIP AND THE OWL TOO TOO WENT ON TO THE SHIP WITH THE DOCTOR BUT CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE STAYED BEHIND BECAUSE AFRICA WAS THEIR PROPER HOME
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
BY THE EDGE OF THE RIVER THEY STOPPED AND SAID FAREWELL THIS TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF MONKEYS WANTED TO SHAKE JOHN DOLITTLE BY THE HAND
AND MAKE THEM INTO A LOT OF THIN STRINGS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN THE ENDS OF THESE STRINGS WERE TIED ON TO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE SWALLOWS TOOK HOLD OF THE STRINGS WITH THEIR FEET
LOST THE MEDICINE BAG IN THE UNDER BRUSH THERE SEEMED NO END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND NOWHERE COULD THEY COME UPON A PATH AT LAST
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
YOU CAN COUNT ITS THREE BIG SAILS ALL RED WHOEVER IT IS THEY ARE COMING AFTER US I WONDER WHO THEY ARE THEY ARE BAD SAILORS SAID JIP AND THEIR SHIP IS VERY SWIFT
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
SAID DAB DAB THE ROAST BEEF MUST BE ON THAT OTHER SHIP OVER THERE BUT THAT'S TEN MILES AWAY SAID THE DOCTOR HE COULDN'T SMELL THAT FAR SURELY OH YES HE COULD SAID DAB DAB
DO NOT SPEAK A WORD OF THIS TO ANY ONE AND WHEN I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASK YOU MUST LET ME AND ALL MY ANIMALS OUT OF PRISON PROMISE BY THE CROWN OF JOLLIGINKI
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER INDEED THEY HAD LOST THEIR WAY VERY BADLY THEY HAD STRAYED A LONG WAY OFF THE PATH AND THE JUNGLE
TO AWAKEN HER AS THE BOOK SAID I SHOULD TIS TRUE INDEED THAT SHE AWOKE BUT WHEN SHE SAW MY FACE SHE CRIED OUT OH HE'S BLACK AND SHE RAN AWAY AND WOULDN'T MARRY ME
TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THAT IT WORKED SO WELL BUT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIDN'T I I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SCRUB THE KING'S KITCHEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WAS SUCH A DIRTY KITCHEN
IF THE KING SHOULD HEAR US HE WILL SEND HIS SOLDIERS TO CATCH US AGAIN FOR I AM SURE HE IS STILL VERY ANGRY OVER THE TRICK I PLAYED ON HIM WHAT I AM WONDERING
DON'T MOVE WHATEVER YOU DO AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS PRINCE BUMPO THE KING'S SON OPENING THE GARDEN GATE HE CARRIED A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES UNDER HIS ARM
LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
RANG FROM YONDER BOWER STRANGE WORTHY PRINCE SAID POLYNESIA KEEPING VERY STILL SO BUMPO COULDN'T SEE HER THOU SAYEST WINGED
I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
SO I COME TO YOU FOR HELP IF YOU WILL TURN ME WHITE SO THAT I MAY GO BACK TO THE SLEEPING BEAUTY I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM AND ANYTHING BESIDES YOU ASK PRINCE BUMPO
SAID THE DOCTOR IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER BOAT TO GO HOME IN OH WELL PERHAPS WE'LL FIND ONE LYING ABOUT ON THE BEACH THAT NOBODY IS USING NEVER LIFT YOUR FOOT
RIGHT UP TO THE EARS HE HELD IT THERE A LONG TIME SO LONG THAT THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO GET DREADFULLY ANXIOUS AND FIDGETY STANDING FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
STARTED UP OFF THE SEAT AND LOOKED ALL AROUND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR HE CRIED METHOUGHT THE SWEET MUSIC OF A FAIRY'S SILVER VOICE
HE CLIMBED HIGH TREES AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE TOP BRANCHES TO TRY AND SEE THE DOCTOR'S HIGH HAT HE WAVED AND SHOUTED HE CALLED TO ALL THE ANIMALS BY NAME BUT IT WAS NO USE
I DON'T BELIEVE THE POOR BOOBY FOUND THE SLEEPING BEAUTY AT ALL SAID JIP THE DOG MOST LIKELY HE KISSED SOME FARMER'S FAT WIFE WHO WAS TAKING A SNOOZE UNDER AN APPLE TREE
THERE LIES A FAMOUS WIZARD JOHN DOLITTLE BY NAME MANY THINGS HE KNOWS OF MEDICINE AND MAGIC AND MIGHTY DEEDS HAS HE PERFORMED
RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEASHORE WHILE BUMPO LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE EMPTY DUNGEON SMILING AFTER THEM HAPPILY HIS BIG FACE SHINING LIKE POLISHED IVORY IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
IT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU NOW WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT WE WILL LOSE OUR WAY UPON THE SEA PULL UP THE ANCHOR AND SET THE SAIL WHEN THE SHIP MOVED OUT UPON THE WATER
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
SO YOU ARE CAUGHT AGAIN THIS TIME YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE TAKE THEM ALL BACK TO PRISON AND PUT DOUBLE LOCKS ON THE DOOR
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
TO BRING A BASIN THEN HE MIXED A LOT OF MEDICINES IN THE BASIN AND TOLD BUMPO TO DIP HIS FACE IN IT THE PRINCE LEANED DOWN AND PUT HIS FACE IN
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
SHALL SCRUB MY KITCHEN FLOOR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE LED BACK TO PRISON AND LOCKED UP AND THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD THAT IN THE MORNING
AND ASKED HER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE KING'S MEN AND LOCKED UP AGAIN WHISPERED POLYNESIA WE LOST OUR WAY IN THE JUNGLE
HE CAME STROLLING DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK HUMMING A SAD SONG TILL HE REACHED A STONE SEAT RIGHT UNDER THE TREE WHERE THE PARROT AND THE MONKEY WERE HIDING THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SEAT
SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE BOTTLES IN HIS MEDICINE BAG SUPPOSING I MADE YOUR HAIR A NICE BLONDE COLOR WOULD NOT THAT DO INSTEAD TO MAKE YOU HAPPY NO SAID BUMPO
NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
THAT POOR SAILOR WILL THINK I'VE STOLEN HIS SHIP IF I DON'T GET HOME SOON I WONDER IF THOSE HINGES ARE LOOSE BUT THE DOOR WAS VERY STRONG AND FIRMLY LOCKED
TO TURN HIM WHITE BUT BE SURE TO MAKE HIM PROMISE YOU FIRST THAT HE WILL OPEN THE PRISON DOOR AND FIND A SHIP FOR YOU TO CROSS THE SEA IN THIS IS ALL VERY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
AND WHILE HE WAS AWAY THE DOCTOR AND THE REST OF THE ANIMALS
SO THE PRINCE PROMISED AND WENT AWAY TO GET A SHIP READY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS DONE THE DOCTOR ASKED DAB DAB
IN A SWIFT SHIP AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO ABOUT IT WHEN THE SWALLOWS HEARD THIS THEY ALL CAME DOWN ON TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM TO UNRAVEL SOME PIECES OF LONG ROPE
THEY STUMBLED INTO WET BOGGY PLACES THEY GOT ALL TANGLED UP IN THICK CONVOLVULUS RUNNERS THEY SCRATCHED THEMSELVES ON THORNS AND TWICE THEY NEARLY
THE BOAT DID NOT GO NEARLY AS FAST AS THE PIRATES' WHICH KEPT COMING ON BEHIND CLOSER AND CLOSER THIS IS A POOR SHIP THE PRINCE GAVE US SAID GUB GUB THE PIG
THE PRINCE LIFTED HIS FACE UP OUT OF THE BASIN BREATHING VERY HARD AND ALL THE ANIMALS CRIED OUT IN SURPRISE FOR THE PRINCE'S FACE HAD TURNED AS WHITE AS SNOW
BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
NO MATTER WHAT COLOR HE WAS MADE STILL HE HAD A GOOD HEART SAID THE DOCTOR ROMANTIC OF COURSE BUT A GOOD HEART AFTER ALL HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES
FAREWELL FAREWELL CRIED THE PRINCE A THOUSAND THANKS GOOD TRIPSITINKA AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT AGAIN WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE
HIS FATHER WHO HAD US LOCKED UP IT WASN'T BUMPO'S FAULT I WONDER IF I OUGHT TO GO BACK AND APOLOGIZE OH WELL
WOOF OO WOOF THEN HE BARKED LOUD AND WOKE HIMSELF UP WITH A SURPRISED LOOK ON HIS FACE SEE CRIED DAB DAB THAT BOAT IS NEARER NOW
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SAID POLYNESIA IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU MUST
I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR LET ME SEE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS MEDICINE BAG MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERATED CHLORINE ON ANIMAL PIGMENT
I HAVE A FEELING IT ISN'T A FRIENDLY SHIP I AM AFRAID THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US JIP WHO WAS LYING NEAR TAKING A NAP IN THE SUN BEGAN TO GROWL AND TALK IN HIS SLEEP
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER
THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
AND IN A MOMENT THE DOCTOR FOUND HIMSELF TRAVELING SO FAST HE HAD TO HOLD HIS HAT ON WITH BOTH HANDS FOR HE FELT AS THOUGH THE SHIP ITSELF
HE MUST BEGIN SCRUBBING THE KITCHEN FLOOR THEY WERE ALL VERY UNHAPPY THIS IS A GREAT NUISANCE SAID THE DOCTOR
THEY STILL STOOD THERE UPON THE ROCKS
TALKING IN A SMALL HIGH VOICE LIKE A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALOUD BUMPO SOME ONE MIGHT TURN THEE INTO A WHITE PRINCE PERCHANCE THE KING'S SON
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER HANS MY UNCLE AND MYSELF IT WAS EFFECTED IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE DESCENT OF LOOSENED STONES DOWN THE DARK GULF
HE WAS LOOKING VERY HARD AT TOAD AS HE SAID THIS AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING A TWINKLE IN THAT ANIMAL'S STILL SORROWFUL EYE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE TO BE DONE CONTINUED THE GRATIFIED BADGER TOAD
I DEMAND AN INSTANT EXPLANATION TAKE THEM OFF HIM THEN YOU TWO ORDERED THE BADGER BRIEFLY THEY HAD TO LAY TOAD OUT ON THE FLOOR KICKING AND CALLING ALL SORTS OF NAMES BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO WORK PROPERLY
BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME IT WAS THAT OF HANS
HOW SO I ASKED YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY
AND I FIND THAT I'M NOT A BIT SORRY OR REPENTANT REALLY SO IT'S NO EARTHLY GOOD SAYING I AM NOW IS IT THEN YOU DON'T PROMISE SAID THE BADGER NEVER TO TOUCH A MOTOR CAR AGAIN CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED TOAD EMPHATICALLY ON THE CONTRARY
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF
I'LL MAKE ONE MORE EFFORT TO BRING YOU TO REASON YOU WILL COME WITH ME INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND THERE YOU WILL HEAR SOME FACTS ABOUT YOURSELF AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER YOU COME OUT OF THAT ROOM THE SAME TOAD THAT YOU WENT IN
THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY
LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT TO MORROW LET US HAVE OUR SUPPER AND GO TO SLEEP THE DARKNESS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE THE PROVISION CASE WAS OPENED WE REFRESHED OURSELVES AND WENT TO SLEEP AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON A BED OF STONES AND LAVA FRAGMENTS
THE QUESTION BEING PUT HANS REPLIED SCARTARIS MY UNCLE SHOT A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE AT ME NOW FOR THE CRATER HE CRIED THE CRATER OF SNAEFELL RESEMBLED AN INVERTED CONE THE OPENING OF WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A LEAGUE IN DIAMETER
RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
I'VE NEVER SEEN TOAD SO DETERMINED
THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE
LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK LIKE SUMMITS THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS
CRIED THE PROFESSOR AND SHARING HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THINK NOT HIS JOY I READ ON THE WESTERN FACE OF THE BLOCK IN RUNIC CHARACTERS HALF MOULDERED AWAY WITH LAPSE OF AGES
I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO LOOK DOWN EITHER OF THEM BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD HASTILY SURVEYED ALL THREE HE WAS PANTING RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GESTICULATING AND UTTERING INCOHERENT EXPRESSIONS HANS AND HIS COMRADES
WHAT CRIED THE BADGER GREATLY SCANDALISED YOU BACKSLIDING ANIMAL
IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT
HAPPILY CERTAIN ASPERITIES AND A FEW BLISTERINGS HERE AND THERE FORMED STEPS AND WE DESCENDED LETTING OUR BAGGAGE SLIP BEFORE US FROM THE END OF A LONG ROPE BUT THAT WHICH FORMED STEPS UNDER OUR FEET BECAME STALACTITES OVERHEAD
OR ELSE HUNTED UP IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD WHICH WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING THE BADGER STRODE HEAVILY INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE TWO ANIMALS WITH AN EXPRESSION FULL OF SERIOUSNESS THE RAT LET HIS EGG SPOON FALL ON THE TABLE CLOTH AND SAT OPEN MOUTHED
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF TWELVE TWENTY NINE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
BUT ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER EVERY HILLOCK
MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS
AND SO IT WAS THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
BY AN OPTICAL LAW WHICH OBTAINS AT ALL GREAT HEIGHTS THE SHORES SEEMED RAISED AND THE CENTRE DEPRESSED IT SEEMED AS IF ONE OF HELBESMER'S RAISED MAPS LAY AT MY FEET
AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
AND HE HAS UNDERTAKEN TO GIVE UP MOTOR CARS ENTIRELY AND FOR EVER I HAVE HIS SOLEMN PROMISE TO THAT EFFECT THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS SAID THE MOLE GRAVELY VERY GOOD NEWS INDEED OBSERVED THE RAT DUBIOUSLY
CHAPTER SIXTEEN BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER
THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THESE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS CRESTED WITH SHEETS OF SNOW REMINDED ONE OF A STORMY SEA IF I LOOKED WESTWARD THERE THE OCEAN LAY SPREAD OUT IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE
IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER THE RIVER HAD RESUMED ITS WONTED BANKS AND ITS ACCUSTOMED PACE AND A HOT SUN SEEMED TO BE PULLING EVERYTHING GREEN AND BUSHY AND SPIKY UP OUT OF THE EARTH TOWARDS HIM AS IF BY STRINGS
ADDED THE MOLE TURNING THE KEY ON HIM THEY DESCENDED THE STAIR TOAD SHOUTING ABUSE AT THEM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND THE THREE FRIENDS THEN MET IN CONFERENCE ON THE SITUATION IT'S GOING TO BE A TEDIOUS BUSINESS SAID THE BADGER SIGHING
WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
ANOTHER NEW AND EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL MOTOR CAR WILL ARRIVE AT TOAD HALL ON APPROVAL OR RETURN AT THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS TOAD IS BUSY ARRAYING HIMSELF IN THOSE SINGULARLY HIDEOUS HABILIMENTS SO DEAR TO HIM
HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
THEY SET OFF UP THE ROAD ON THEIR MISSION OF MERCY BADGER LEADING THE WAY ANIMALS WHEN IN COMPANY WALK IN A PROPER AND SENSIBLE MANNER IN SINGLE FILE INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING ALL ACROSS THE ROAD AND BEING OF NO USE OR SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER IN CASE OF SUDDEN TROUBLE OR DANGER
PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE
HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE FORTY SIX URSA MINOR
ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
WHEN LYING ON MY BACK I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW A BRIGHT SPARKLING POINT OF LIGHT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GIGANTIC TUBE THREE THOUSAND FEET LONG NOW A VAST TELESCOPE IT WAS A STAR WHICH SEEN FROM THIS DEPTH
SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
HE TOOK TOAD FIRMLY BY THE ARM LED HIM INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM THAT'S NO GOOD SAID THE RAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS
THEN AS TOAD WAS HUSTLED THROUGH THE DOOR STRUGGLING AND PROTESTING HE TURNED TO THE CHAUFFEUR IN CHARGE OF THE NEW MOTOR CAR I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE WANTED TO DAY HE SAID MISTER TOAD HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
WE SHALL DESCEND AT A SLOW RATE AND OUR LUNGS WILL BECOME INURED TO A DENSER ATMOSPHERE AERONAUTS FIND THE WANT OF AIR AS THEY RISE TO HIGH ELEVATIONS BUT WE SHALL PERHAPS HAVE TOO MUCH
AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
YOU'VE GONE ON SQUANDERING THE MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU AND YOU'RE GETTING US ANIMALS A BAD NAME IN THE DISTRICT BY YOUR FURIOUS DRIVING AND YOUR SMASHES AND YOUR ROWS WITH THE POLICE
HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
SUCH AS THE MINES OF KITZ BAHL IN TYROL AND THOSE OF WUTTEMBOURG IN BOHEMIA
WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
SAID THE RAT AS THEY THRUST HIM INTO HIS BEDROOM
HE MUST NEVER BE LEFT AN INSTANT UNGUARDED WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT IN TURNS TO BE WITH HIM TILL THE POISON HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT OF HIS SYSTEM THEY ARRANGED WATCHES ACCORDINGLY
THIS IS MY CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO EXACT OBSERVATIONS THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE ADVANCES AT THE RATE OF ONE DEGREE
ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
GREENLAND SAID HE GREENLAND I CRIED YES
THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS HANS TOOK THE TOOLS I TOOK THE ARMS
YOU'VE OFTEN ASKED US THREE TO COME AND STAY WITH YOU TOAD IN THIS HANDSOME HOUSE OF YOURS WELL NOW WE'RE GOING TO WHEN WE'VE CONVERTED YOU TO A PROPER POINT OF VIEW WE MAY QUIT BUT NOT BEFORE TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS YOU TWO AND LOCK HIM UP IN HIS BEDROOM
COME ON YOU FELLOWS HE CRIED CHEERFULLY ON CATCHING SIGHT OF THEM YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO COME WITH ME FOR A JOLLY TO COME FOR A JOLLY FOR A ER JOLLY
TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
VERY WELL THEN SAID THE BADGER FIRMLY RISING TO HIS FEET SINCE YOU WON'T YIELD TO PERSUASION WE'LL TRY WHAT FORCE CAN DO I FEARED IT WOULD COME TO THIS ALL ALONG
WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW STRAIGHT ABOVE ME THE UPPER APERTURE OF THE CONE FRAMING A BIT OF SKY OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND
TOAD LOOKED DESPERATELY THIS WAY AND THAT WHILE THE OTHER ANIMALS WAITED IN GRAVE SILENCE AT LAST HE SPOKE NO HE SAID A LITTLE SULLENLY BUT STOUTLY I'M NOT SORRY AND IT WASN'T FOLLY AT ALL IT WAS SIMPLY GLORIOUS
POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
THIS WAS A WONDERFUL THING INDEED THAT THE BADGER SHOULD PAY A FORMAL CALL ON THEM OR INDEED ON ANYBODY HE GENERALLY HAD TO BE CAUGHT IF YOU WANTED HIM BADLY AS HE SLIPPED QUIETLY ALONG A HEDGEROW OF AN EARLY MORNING OR A LATE EVENING
CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MADDEST GEOLOGIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE STUDIED THE NATURE OF THE ROCKS THAT WE WERE PASSING I AM SURE I DID TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT THEM
HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
THE BED WAS HARD THE SHELTER NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
AND FOR PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK THERE WAS A SATISFACTION IN STORE PROPORTIONED TO HIS DESPERATE ANXIETIES
BUT NO I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY NEARED THE DOOR IT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MISTER TOAD ARRAYED IN GOGGLES CAP GAITERS AND ENORMOUS OVERCOAT CAME SWAGGERING DOWN THE STEPS DRAWING ON HIS GAUNTLETED GLOVES HULLO
YOU KNEW IT MUST COME TO THIS SOONER OR LATER TOAD THE BADGER EXPLAINED SEVERELY YOU'VE DISREGARDED ALL THE WARNINGS WE'VE GIVEN YOU
THEN THE RAT SAT ON HIM AND THE MOLE GOT HIS MOTOR CLOTHES OFF HIM BIT BY BIT AND THEY STOOD HIM UP ON HIS LEGS AGAIN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS BLUSTERING SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE EVAPORATED WITH THE REMOVAL OF HIS FINE PANOPLY
THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
WE'LL TEACH HIM TO BE A SENSIBLE TOAD THIS VERY MORNING CONTINUED THE BADGER TAKING AN ARM CHAIR AS I LEARNT LAST NIGHT FROM A TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE
IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
I SAID I WOULD TAKE HIM IN HAND AS SOON AS THE WINTER WAS WELL OVER AND I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM IN HAND TO DAY TOAD'S HOUR OF COURSE CRIED THE MOLE DELIGHTEDLY HOORAY
WHILE WE ARRANGE MATTERS BETWEEN OURSELVES IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TOADY YOU KNOW SAID THE RAT KINDLY AS TOAD KICKING AND STRUGGLING WAS HAULED UP THE STAIRS BY HIS TWO FAITHFUL FRIENDS
SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT
IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE STANDING UPON THE SURFACE OF A ROCK JAMMED IN ACROSS THE CHIMNEY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER HANS PULLED THE ROPE BY ONE OF ITS ENDS THE OTHER ROSE IN THE AIR
HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
BUT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE REALITIES OF THINGS BY THE ARRIVAL OF HANS AND THE PROFESSOR WHO JOINED ME ON THE SUMMIT MY UNCLE POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE FAR WEST A LIGHT STEAM OR MIST A SEMBLANCE OF LAND WHICH BOUNDED THE DISTANT HORIZON OF WATERS
EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
NOW THAT HE WAS MERELY TOAD AND NO LONGER THE TERROR OF THE HIGHWAY HE GIGGLED FEEBLY AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER APPEALINGLY
SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT
EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
AND PRESENTLY THEY NOTICED THAT THE SERMON BEGAN TO BE PUNCTUATED AT INTERVALS BY LONG DRAWN SOBS EVIDENTLY PROCEEDING FROM THE BOSOM OF TOAD WHO WAS A SOFT HEARTED AND AFFECTIONATE FELLOW VERY EASILY CONVERTED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ANY POINT OF VIEW
I'D HAVE SAID ANYTHING IN THERE YOU'RE SO ELOQUENT DEAR BADGER AND SO MOVING AND SO CONVINCING AND PUT ALL YOUR POINTS SO FRIGHTFULLY WELL YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH ME IN THERE AND YOU KNOW IT BUT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY MIND SINCE AND GOING OVER THINGS IN IT
YOU TWO ANIMALS WILL ACCOMPANY ME INSTANTLY TO TOAD HALL AND THE WORK OF RESCUE SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED RIGHT YOU ARE CRIED THE RAT STARTING UP WE'LL RESCUE THE POOR UNHAPPY ANIMAL WE'LL CONVERT HIM
THEY REACHED THE CARRIAGE DRIVE OF TOAD HALL TO FIND AS THE BADGER HAD ANTICIPATED A SHINY NEW MOTOR CAR OF GREAT SIZE
THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER
THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
AFTER SOME THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BADGER REAPPEARED SOLEMNLY LEADING BY THE PAW A VERY LIMP AND DEJECTED TOAD HIS SKIN HUNG BAGGILY ABOUT HIM
MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
HE WILL NOT REQUIRE THE CAR PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS FINAL YOU NEEDN'T WAIT THEN HE FOLLOWED THE OTHERS INSIDE AND SHUT THE DOOR
AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN
LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER
AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
MISS BINGLEY WAS ENGROSSED BY MISTER DARCY HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN
YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL THERE IS NOT A FINER COUNTY IN ENGLAND THAN DERBYSHIRE WITH ALL MY HEART
ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE
CHAPTER FIVE THROUGH SOLWAY SANDS THROUGH TAROSS MOSS BLINDFOLD HE KNEW THE PATHS TO CROSS BY WILY TURNS BY DESPERATE BOUNDS HAD BAFFLED PERCY'S BEST BLOODHOUNDS
THEY HAVE EACH THEIR ADVANTAGES AND I CAN BE EQUALLY HAPPY IN EITHER AYE THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DISPOSITION BUT THAT GENTLEMAN LOOKING AT DARCY SEEMED TO THINK THE COUNTRY WAS NOTHING AT ALL
WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
THE YOUNGEST OF HER DAUGHTERS PUT HERSELF FORWARD THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE WHOLE VISIT AND THE RESULT OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SHOULD TAX MISTER BINGLEY WITH HAVING PROMISED ON HIS FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO GIVE A BALL AT NETHERFIELD
OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
IT INCLUDES THE GIFT OF MAKING ANY COLOR APPEAR WHITE ELYSIUM
EXPOSTULATION
AND HER LIPS PRIMMED UP INTO A LINE OF DETERMINATION I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IS ALL THERE IS LEFT IN LIFE FOR ME NOW THAT MY FRIEND HAS BEEN RUTHLESSLY TORN FROM ME IN SCHOOL I CAN LOOK AT HER AND MUSE OVER DAYS DEPARTED
UPON MY FOREHEAD AND ALONG MY SPINE AT THY COMMAND ESCHEWING PLEASURE'S CUP WITH THE HOT GRAPE I WARM NO MORE MY WIT WHEN ON THY STOOL OF PENITENCE I SIT I'M QUITE CONVERTED FOR I CAN'T GET UP
SO NICE FOR TRIMMING APRONS KATIE BOULTER
THERE WERE NO MORE DISEASES AFTER ZYMOSIS SO I CONCLUDED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THE MATTER WITH ME I SAT AND PONDERED
MUST HAVE HAD IT FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING IT
MARILLA PESSIMISTICALLY EXPECTED MORE TROUBLE SINCE ANNE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT NONE DEVELOPED PERHAPS ANNE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE MODEL SPIRIT FROM MINNIE ANDREWS
AS ROBBERS THIEVES SWINDLERS DUNCES LUNATICS IDIOTS AND ETHNOLOGISTS EUCHARIST
THE MEMORY OF DOCTOR FRANKLIN IS JUSTLY HELD IN GREAT REVERENCE PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE WHERE A WAXEN EFFIGY OF HIM WAS RECENTLY ON EXHIBITION BEARING THE FOLLOWING TOUCHING ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE AND SERVICES TO SCIENCE
EVEN DIANA GETS ALONG BETTER THAN I DO BUT I DON'T MIND BEING BEATEN BY DIANA
TO DECLARE THE RABBIT THE CAUSE OF A DOG EGOTIST
A WEEK ON THE ROLLING DEEP
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH ME IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER I KNEW IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I HAD JUST BEEN READING A PATENT LIVER PILL CIRCULAR
BUT THE UNANIMOUS OPINION WAS THAT IT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN BROUGHT ON BY OVERWORK WHAT WE WANT IS REST SAID HARRIS REST AND A COMPLETE CHANGE SAID GEORGE
IT'S SO NICE TO BE APPRECIATED SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT THE GIRLS WERE NOT THE ONLY SCHOLARS WHO APPRECIATED HER WHEN ANNE WENT TO HER SEAT AFTER DINNER HOUR
AT LEAST SHE GOT ON VERY WELL WITH MISTER PHILLIPS THENCEFORTH SHE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER STUDIES HEART AND SOUL DETERMINED NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN ANY CLASS BY GILBERT BLYTHE THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM WAS SOON APPARENT
BUT IS PLACABLE WITH AN OBOLUS A SEVERELY VIRTUOUS CENSOR BUT SO CHARITABLE WITHAL
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO WALK THE HOSPITALS IF THEY HAD ME I WAS A HOSPITAL IN MYSELF
IN WHICH WERE DETAILED THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS BY WHICH A MAN COULD TELL WHEN HIS LIVER WAS OUT OF ORDER
MADE A JOKE ON THE EX ISLE OF ERIN COLDLY RECEIVED WAR WITH THE WHOLE WORLD EXISTENCE
A BEARER OF GOOD TIDINGS PARTICULARLY IN A RELIGIOUS SENSE SUCH AS ASSURE US OF OUR OWN SALVATION AND THE DAMNATION OF OUR NEIGHBORS EVERLASTING A D J LASTING FOREVER
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
AND THAT THE ACUTE STAGE WOULD COMMENCE IN ABOUT ANOTHER FORTNIGHT BRIGHT'S DISEASE I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND I HAD ONLY IN A MODIFIED FORM AND SO FAR AS THAT WAS CONCERNED I MIGHT LIVE FOR YEARS
I'LL TRY TO BE A MODEL PUPIL AGREED ANNE DOLEFULLY THERE WON'T BE MUCH FUN IN IT I EXPECT MISTER PHILLIPS SAID MINNIE ANDREWS WAS A MODEL PUPIL AND THERE ISN'T A SPARK OF IMAGINATION OR LIFE IN HER
AND FORBIDDING CHRIST TO SAVE HIM
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A NEW INTEREST IN LIFE THE NEXT AFTERNOON ANNE BENDING OVER HER PATCHWORK AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW HAPPENED TO GLANCE OUT AND BEHELD DIANA DOWN BY THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE BECKONING MYSTERIOUSLY
ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT
DESCRIBED IN THE CHARGE SHEET AS A MEDICAL STUDENT SO THAT HE NATURALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT FAMILY PHYSICIANARY WAY OF PUTTING THINGS I AGREED WITH GEORGE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SEEK OUT SOME RETIRED AND OLD WORLD SPOT
ASTONISHMENT AND HOPE STRUGGLING IN HER EXPRESSIVE EYES BUT THE HOPE FADED WHEN SHE SAW DIANA'S DEJECTED COUNTENANCE YOUR MOTHER HASN'T RELENTED SHE GASPED DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY NO AND OH ANNE
A SNAKE TO A PIG A PIG TO A MAN AND A MAN TO A WORM EDITOR
WE WERE SITTING IN MY ROOM SMOKING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD WE WERE BAD FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE ALL FEELING SEEDY AND WE WERE GETTING QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT HARRIS SAID HE FELT SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FITS OF
IT WAS ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED ON GILBERT'S SIDE BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE FEARED THAT THE SAME THING CANNOT BE SAID OF ANNE WHO HAD CERTAINLY AN UNPRAISEWORTHY TENACITY FOR HOLDING GRUDGES SHE WAS AS INTENSE IN HER HATREDS AS IN HER LOVES
THE POSITION FARTHEST REMOVED ON EITHER HAND FROM THE INTERLOCUTOR THE MAN WAS PERISHING APACE WHO PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE THE SEAL OF DEATH WAS ON HIS FACE TWAS PALLID FOR TWAS CLEAN THIS IS THE END
ONE OF THE MANY METHODS BY WHICH FOOLS PREFER TO LOSE THEIR FRIENDS
THE DOORKEEPER LOOKED WITH A COMICAL TWIST OF THE FACE AT THE EMINENT EGOTIST AND SAID GO AWAY FOR WE SETTLE HERE
A TRANSIENT HORRIBLE FANTASTIC DREAM WHEREIN IS NOTHING YET ALL THINGS DO SEEM FROM WHICH WE'RE WAKENED BY A FRIENDLY NUDGE OF OUR BEDFELLOW DEATH AND CRY O FUDGE
AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
HIS BOOK WAS ONCE ESTEEMED OF GREAT AUTHORITY IN THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AND IS STILL I UNDERSTAND STUDIED WITH PLEASURE TO THE MIND AND PROFIT OF THE SOUL
THIS ILLUSTRIOUS SAVANT AFTER HAVING MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES AROUND THE WORLD
ANNE STOOD AND WATCHED DIANA OUT OF SIGHT
AND AT INTERVALS FROM BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE IS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOREMAN DEMANDING THREE INCHES OF WIT
I COULDN'T LOVE ANYBODY AS I LOVE YOU OH DIANA CRIED ANNE CLASPING HER HANDS DO YOU LOVE ME WHY OF COURSE I DO DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT NO ANNE DREW A LONG BREATH
A PARTIAL DEFINITION OF THE WORD EVERLASTING
I READ THE PRESCRIPTION IT RAN
GIDDINESS COME OVER HIM AT TIMES THAT HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
WE SHALL GET HIM AFTER AWHILE IF WE ARE SPARED
I HAVE SINCE BEEN INDUCED TO COME TO THE OPINION THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND MUST HAVE BEEN BEATING
WHAT I SUFFER IN THAT WAY NO TONGUE CAN TELL FROM MY EARLIEST INFANCY I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT AS A BOY THE DISEASE HARDLY EVER LEFT ME FOR A DAY
PRAISE OF A PERSON WHO HAS EITHER THE ADVANTAGES OF WEALTH AND POWER OR THE CONSIDERATION TO BE DEAD EVANGELIST
PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS IT WAS BORNE IN UPON ME THAT I HAD FAIRLY GOT IT I SAT FOR AWHILE FROZEN WITH HORROR AND THEN IN THE LISTLESSNESS OF DESPAIR I AGAIN TURNED OVER THE PAGES
ONE TEN MILE WALK EVERY MORNING ONE BED AT ELEVEN SHARP EVERY NIGHT AND DON'T STUFF UP YOUR HEAD WITH THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
OH DIANA WILL YOU PROMISE FAITHFULLY NEVER TO FORGET ME THE FRIEND OF YOUR YOUTH NO MATTER WHAT DEARER FRIENDS MAY CARESS THEE INDEED I WILL SOBBED DIANA AND I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BOSOM FRIEND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
AN APPROVED REMEDY FOR THE DISEASE OF GARRULITY IT IS ALSO MUCH USED IN CASES OF EXTREME POVERTY ELECTOR
A SPECIAL BUT NOT PARTICULAR KIND OF LIAR END
FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT I HAD THAT TOO BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN MY CASE AND DETERMINED TO SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND SO STARTED ALPHABETICALLY
FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD AND DREAM AWAY A SUNNY WEEK AMONG ITS DROWSY LANES SOME HALF FORGOTTEN NOOK HIDDEN AWAY BY THE FAIRIES OUT OF REACH OF THE NOISY WORLD
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
IT IS WITH NO SMALL DIFFIDENCE THAT I VENTURE TO OFFER THIS BRIEF AND ELEMENTARY DEFINITION FOR I AM NOT UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A BULKY VOLUME BY A SOMETIME BISHOP OF WORCESTER ENTITLED
PETULANTLY UTTERING HIS MIND AT THE TAIL OF A DOG THEN STRAIGHTWAY MURMURS A MILD MELODIOUS LAY SOFT AS THE COOING OF A DONKEY INTONING ITS PRAYER TO THE EVENING STAR MASTER OF MYSTERIES AND LORD OF LAW
A SHORT SHARP SAYING IN PROSE OR VERSE
THEY ARE AWFULLY FASHIONABLE NOW AND ONLY THREE GIRLS IN SCHOOL KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT REMEMBER YOUR TRUE FRIEND DIANA BARRY ANNE READ THE NOTE
AND ESOTERIC THOSE THAT NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND IT IS THE LATTER THAT HAVE MOST PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED MODERN THOUGHT AND FOUND GREATEST ACCEPTANCE IN OUR TIME ETHNOLOGY
BITTER TEARS IF I DID ANNE WAS WELCOMED BACK TO SCHOOL WITH OPEN ARMS HER IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SORELY MISSED IN GAMES HER VOICE IN THE SINGING AND HER DRAMATIC ABILITY IN THE PERUSAL ALOUD OF BOOKS AT DINNER HOUR
THOSE SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN ALL THE DISPENSARY STUFF WE SAT THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR DESCRIBING TO EACH OTHER OUR MALADIES I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE AND WILLIAM HARRIS HOW I FELT WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING
THE SICK MAN SAID IN FAINT AND FAILING TONES A MOMENT LATER HE WAS DEAD AND TAMBOURINE WAS BONES
IF I WAS A CO OPERATIVE STORES AND FAMILY HOTEL COMBINED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBLIGE YOU
A PERSON OF LOW TASTE
AN INSCRIPTION ON A TOMB SHOWING THAT VIRTUES ACQUIRED BY DEATH HAVE A RETROACTIVE EFFECT FOLLOWING IS A TOUCHING EXAMPLE
AND WE DREW UP TO THE TABLE AND TOYED WITH A LITTLE STEAK AND ONIONS AND SOME RHUBARB TART I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER THE FIRST HALF HOUR OR SO I SEEMED TO TAKE NO INTEREST WHATEVER IN MY FOOD AN UNUSUAL THING FOR ME
THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
TERRESTRIAN THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR ANY SUCH COURSE LUNARIAN PRECEDENT WHAT IS THAT TERRESTRIAN
THEY GAVE ME CLUMPS ON THE SIDE OF THE
THE LAW OF MODERATION HAIL HIGH EXCESS ESPECIALLY IN WINE TO THEE IN WORSHIP DO I BEND THE KNEE
DUST SHAKEN OUT OF A BOOK INTO AN EMPTY SKULL SO WIDE HIS ERUDITION'S MIGHTY SPAN HE KNEW CREATION'S ORIGIN AND PLAN AND ONLY CAME BY ACCIDENT TO GRIEF HE THOUGHT POOR MAN TWAS RIGHT TO BE A THIEF
MY SKULL THY PULPIT AS MY PAUNCH THY SHRINE PRECEPT ON PRECEPT AYE AND LINE ON LINE COULD NE'ER PERSUADE SO SWEETLY TO AGREE WITH REASON AS THY TOUCH EXACT AND FREE
MEANS THAT THE EXCEPTION TESTS THE RULE PUTS IT TO THE PROOF NOT CONFIRMS IT THE MALEFACTOR WHO DREW THE MEANING FROM THIS EXCELLENT DICTUM AND SUBSTITUTED A CONTRARY ONE OF HIS OWN
THE SECOND OF TWO PHENOMENA WHICH ALWAYS OCCUR TOGETHER IN THE SAME ORDER THE FIRST CALLED A CAUSE IS SAID TO GENERATE THE OTHER WHICH IS NO MORE SENSIBLE
HUCKLE EXECUTIVE
A MAN WHO TO ALL THINGS UNDER THE SKY ASSENTS BY ETERNALLY VOTING I EJECTION
MEGACEPH CHOSEN TO SERVE THE STATE IN THE HALLS OF LEGISLATIVE DEBATE ONE DAY WITH ALL HIS CREDENTIALS CAME TO THE CAPITOL'S DOOR AND ANNOUNCED HIS NAME
A THING WHICH TAKES THE LIBERTY TO DIFFER FROM OTHER THINGS OF ITS CLASS
AND THEN IN AN UNTHINKING MOMENT I IDLY TURNED THE LEAVES AND BEGAN TO INDOLENTLY STUDY DISEASES GENERALLY I FORGET WHICH WAS THE FIRST DISTEMPER I PLUNGED INTO SOME FEARFUL DEVASTATING SCOURGE I KNOW
AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND WENT OUT I DID NOT OPEN IT
WHAT A DOCTOR WANTS I SAID IS PRACTICE HE SHALL HAVE ME HE WILL GET MORE PRACTICE OUT OF ME THAN OUT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED OF YOUR ORDINARY COMMONPLACE PATIENTS WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO DISEASES EACH SO I WENT STRAIGHT UP AND SAW HIM AND HE SAID WELL
WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO ENFORCE THE WISHES OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT SHALL BE PLEASED TO PRONOUNCE THEM INVALID AND OF NO EFFECT
THE ART OF ORALLY PERSUADING FOOLS
I CAME TO TYPHOID FEVER READ THE SYMPTOMS
LUNARIAN THEN WHEN YOUR CONGRESS HAS PASSED A LAW IT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE SUPREME COURT IN ORDER THAT IT MAY AT ONCE BE KNOWN WHETHER IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL TERRESTRIAN O NO IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPREME COURT
I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME DEAR BOY WITH TELLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME LIFE IS BRIEF AND YOU MIGHT PASS AWAY BEFORE I HAD FINISHED BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT THE MATTER WITH ME I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE
THE CUR FORETELLS THE KNELL OF PARTING DAY THE LOAFING HERD WINDS SLOWLY O'ER THE LEA THE WISE MAN HOMEWARD PLODS I ONLY STAY TO FIDDLE FADDLE IN A MINOR KEY ELOQUENCE
EXERTED AN EVIL POWER WHICH APPEARS TO BE IMMORTAL EXCESS
SHE WOULD NOT STOOP TO ADMIT THAT SHE MEANT TO RIVAL GILBERT IN SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS EXISTENCE WHICH ANNE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED BUT THE RIVALRY WAS THERE AND HONORS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN THEM
UNTIL HAVING PERHAPS BEEN ENFORCED FOR MANY YEARS SOMEBODY OBJECTS TO ITS OPERATION AGAINST HIMSELF I MEAN HIS CLIENT THE PRESIDENT IF HE APPROVES IT BEGINS TO EXECUTE IT AT ONCE
I FELT MY PULSE I COULD NOT AT FIRST FEEL ANY PULSE AT ALL
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW
BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED
A BONDMAN'S CHANGE FROM THE TYRANNY OF ANOTHER TO THE DESPOTISM OF HIMSELF HE WAS A SLAVE AT WORD HE WENT AND CAME HIS IRON COLLAR CUT HIM TO THE BONE THEN LIBERTY ERASED HIS OWNER'S NAME
TERRESTRIAN IT DOES LUNARIAN WHY THEN SHOULD NOT YOUR LAWS PREVIOUSLY TO BEING EXECUTED BE VALIDATED NOT BY THE SIGNATURE OF YOUR PRESIDENT BUT BY THAT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
BY EMBALMING THEIR DEAD AND THEREBY DERANGING THE NATURAL BALANCE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE THE EGYPTIANS MADE THEIR ONCE FERTILE AND POPULOUS COUNTRY BARREN AND INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING MORE THAN A MEAGRE CREW THE MODERN METALLIC
TO SERVE ONESELF IS ECONOMY OF ADMINISTRATION IN EACH HUMAN HEART ARE A TIGER A PIG AN ASS AND A NIGHTINGALE DIVERSITY OF CHARACTER IS DUE TO THEIR UNEQUAL ACTIVITY
I GOT DOWN THE BOOK AND READ ALL
DO YOUR POLICEMEN ALSO HAVE TO APPROVE THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT THEY ENFORCE TERRESTRIAN NOT YET
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO CUT IT WITH QUERIED DIANA WIPING AWAY THE TEARS WHICH ANNE'S AFFECTING ACCENTS HAD CAUSED TO FLOW AFRESH AND RETURNING TO PRACTICALITIES YES I'VE GOT MY PATCHWORK SCISSORS IN MY APRON POCKET FORTUNATELY
KISSED THE BOOKMARK AND DISPATCHED A PROMPT REPLY BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL MY OWN DARLING DIANA OF COURSE I AM NOT CROSS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OBEY YOUR MOTHER OUR SPIRITS CAN COMMUNE
ANNE AND GILBERT WERE BOTH PROMOTED INTO THE FIFTH CLASS AND ALLOWED TO BEGIN STUDYING THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRANCHES BY WHICH LATIN GEOMETRY FRENCH AND ALGEBRA WERE MEANT IN GEOMETRY ANNE MET HER WATERLOO
WE SMILED SADLY AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID WE SUPPOSED WE HAD BETTER TRY TO SWALLOW A BIT HARRIS SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING IN ONE'S STOMACH OFTEN KEPT THE DISEASE IN CHECK AND MISSUS POPPETS BROUGHT THE TRAY IN

PLEASE SEE THAT IT IS BURIED WITH ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL LIVE VERY LONG PERHAPS WHEN SHE SEES ME LYING COLD AND DEAD BEFORE HER MISSUS BARRY MAY FEEL REMORSE FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE AND WILL LET DIANA COME TO MY FUNERAL
BEDIZENED WITH STRIPED RED AND YELLOW PAPER COSTING TWO CENTS WHERE ORDINARY PENCILS COST ONLY ONE WHICH HE SENT UP TO HER AFTER DINNER HOUR MET WITH A MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION ANNE WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT IT
THAN A WHOLE BOX OF PILLS DOES NOW
THE WISDOM THAT ENABLES US TO RECOGNIZE AS AN UNDESIRABLE OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE FOLLY THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EMBRACED
AND REWARDED THE DONOR WITH A SMILE WHICH EXALTED THAT INFATUATED YOUTH STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT AND CAUSED HIM TO MAKE SUCH FEARFUL ERRORS IN HIS DICTATION THAT MISTER PHILLIPS KEPT HIM IN AFTER SCHOOL TO REWRITE IT
ESOTERIC A D J VERY PARTICULARLY ABSTRUSE AND CONSUMMATELY OCCULT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHIES WERE OF TWO KINDS EXOTERIC THOSE THAT THE PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES COULD PARTLY UNDERSTAND
FROM THE OFFICER OF LOWER RANK TO WHOM HIS DEATH WOULD GIVE PROMOTION EPICURE
THAT MY LIFE WAS PRESERVED AND IS STILL GOING ON IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE GOING BACK TO THE LIVER PILL CIRCULAR I HAD THE SYMPTOMS BEYOND ALL MISTAKE THE CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING A GENERAL DISINCLINATION TO WORK OF ANY KIND
ALTHOUGH MUCH IMPROOVED YOURS UNTIL DEATH US DO PART ANNE OR CORDELIA SHIRLEY P S I SHALL SLEEP WITH YOUR LETTER UNDER MY PILLOW TONIGHT A OR C S
THERE ARE THREE SEXES MALES FEMALES AND GIRLS BEAUTY IN WOMEN AND DISTINCTION IN MEN ARE ALIKE IN THIS
AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THEE DIANA SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN THE YEARS TO COME THY MEMORY WILL SHINE LIKE A STAR OVER MY LONELY LIFE
ONE WHO ENJOYS THE SACRED PRIVILEGE OF VOTING FOR THE MAN OF ANOTHER MAN'S CHOICE ELECTRICITY
MISTER PHILLIPS MIGHT NOT BE A VERY GOOD TEACHER BUT A PUPIL SO INFLEXIBLY DETERMINED ON LEARNING AS ANNE WAS COULD HARDLY ESCAPE MAKING PROGRESS UNDER ANY KIND OF TEACHER
I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR OF YOUR DYING OF GRIEF AS LONG AS YOU CAN TALK ANNE SAID MARILLA UNSYMPATHETICALLY THE FOLLOWING MONDAY ANNE SURPRISED MARILLA BY COMING DOWN FROM HER ROOM WITH HER BASKET OF BOOKS ON HER ARM AND HIP
THE VIOLET AND ROSE ARE LANGUISHING FOR A NIBBLE AT HIS GLUTOEUS MAXIMUS EMOTION
HE SAID HE DIDN'T KEEP IT I SAID YOU ARE A CHEMIST
WISE PIOUS HUMBLE AND ALL THAT WHO SHOWED US LIFE AS ALL SHOULD LIVE IT LET THAT BE SAID AND GOD FORGIVE IT
SO HOW CAN ANY ONE KNOW EXHORT
CHOLERA I HAD WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS AND DIPHTHERIA I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORN WITH I PLODDED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TWENTY SIX LETTERS AND THE ONLY MALADY I COULD CONCLUDE I HAD NOT GOT
THAT IT WILL PROPEL A STREET CAR BETTER THAN A GAS JET
IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL STUFF MARILLA SHE GROANED I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN IT AT ALL MISTER PHILLIPS SAYS I'M THE WORST DUNCE HE EVER SAW AT IT
EXCOMMUNICATION
AND EVEN IF I HAD IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME SOMEHOW LITTLE DREAM GIRLS ARE NOT SATISFYING AFTER A REAL FRIEND DIANA AND I HAD SUCH AN AFFECTING FAREWELL DOWN BY THE SPRING IT WILL BE SACRED IN MY MEMORY FOREVER
AND JULIA BELL COPIED CAREFULLY ON A PIECE OF PALE PINK PAPER SCALLOPED ON THE EDGES THE FOLLOWING EFFUSION WHEN TWILIGHT DROPS HER CURTAIN DOWN AND PINS IT WITH A STAR REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND THOUGH SHE MAY WANDER FAR
WOMEN IN LOVE ARE LESS ASHAMED THAN MEN THEY HAVE LESS TO BE ASHAMED OF WHILE YOUR FRIEND HOLDS YOU AFFECTIONATELY BY BOTH YOUR HANDS YOU ARE SAFE FOR YOU CAN WATCH BOTH HIS EPITAPH
I FELT RATHER HURT ABOUT THIS AT FIRST
AND A SMALL PARCEL WERE PASSED ACROSS TO ANNE DEAR ANNE RAN THE FORMER MOTHER SAYS I'M NOT TO PLAY WITH YOU OR TALK TO YOU EVEN IN SCHOOL IT ISN'T MY FAULT AND DON'T BE CROSS AT ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS EVER
WHY I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE I CANNOT TELL YOU BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT I HAVE NOT GOT IT EVERYTHING ELSE HOWEVER I HAVE GOT AND I TOLD HIM HOW I CAME TO DISCOVER IT ALL
NOW GILBERT WAS HEAD OF THE SPELLING CLASS NOW ANNE WITH A TOSS OF HER LONG RED BRAIDS SPELLED HIM DOWN ONE MORNING GILBERT HAD ALL HIS SUMS DONE CORRECTLY AND HAD HIS NAME WRITTEN ON THE BLACKBOARD ON THE ROLL OF HONOR
THE OVERSTRAIN UPON OUR BRAINS HAS PRODUCED A GENERAL DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGE OF SCENE AND ABSENCE OF THE NECESSITY FOR THOUGHT WILL RESTORE THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
ONE WHO SERVES HIS COUNTRY BY RESIDING ABROAD YET IS NOT AN AMBASSADOR
NO SIR BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO ANCHOR ON IT
SHE IS JUST DULL AND POKY AND NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT I FEEL SO DEPRESSED THAT PERHAPS IT WILL COME EASY TO ME NOW I'M GOING ROUND BY THE ROAD I COULDN'T BEAR TO GO BY THE BIRCH PATH ALL ALONE I SHOULD WEEP
OF WHOM NOT A SINGLE FRAGMENT WAS EVER RECOVERED ELECTRICITY SEEMS DESTINED TO PLAY A MOST IMPORTANT PART IN THE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES THE QUESTION OF ITS ECONOMICAL APPLICATION TO SOME PURPOSES IS STILL UNSETTLED
ORIGINAL MOTION CARRIED BY MAJORITY OF THREE TO ONE THERE WERE FOUR OF US GEORGE
MONADS AND OF AN INTERNAL POWER OF REPRESENTATION IN THEM
ALL IN GENERAL WERE LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES AND IN THEIR HEARTS WISH'D HIM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXCEPT THE ENVIOUS MAN WHO AS HE PASS'D BY FETCH'D A DEEP SIGH AND TURN'D HIS HEAD ASIDE THE POPULACE
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO THEORIES BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS EVIDENT EFFORT THAT BASIS OF ACTIVITY THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SO MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED AS SOMETHING SUI GENERIS
IN A JUDGEMENT ONE MAY CALL THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS LOGICAL MATTER FOR THE JUDGEMENT
AND DIVISIBLE TO INFINITY IN PART ALL MEN NEGLECT IT IN THE PASSAGE AND ALL REGRET THE LOSS OF IT WHEN TIS PAST NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT IT IT BURIES IN OBLIVION WHATEVER IS UNWORTHY OF BEING TRANSMITTED
AND WAS HIS FAVOURITE MINISTER AT COURT AS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PAST SERVICES HE WAS IN SHORT THE KING'S REAL FRIEND AND ZADIG WAS THE ONLY MONARCH IN THE UNIVERSE THAT COULD BOAST OF SUCH AN ATTENDANT
THE ACT WHEREBY I COMPARE MY REPRESENTATIONS WITH THE FACULTY OF COGNITION WHICH ORIGINATES THEM AND WHEREBY I DISTINGUISH WHETHER THEY ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER AS BELONGING TO THE PURE UNDERSTANDING OR TO SENSUOUS INTUITION I TERM TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
IT EXISTS IN ALL DOCTRINES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUGHT AND FEELING IS EXPUNGED AND FEELING IS BROUGHT BACK TO THOUGHT
AND GAVE HIM AN HONOURABLE MILITARY POST IN HIS ARMY WITH A FARTHER PROMISE OF PROMOTION TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY BUT UPON THIS EXPRESS CONDITION THAT HE WOULD ACT FOR THE FUTURE AS A SOLDIER OF HONOUR BUT ASSUR'D HIM AT THE SAME TIME
QUALITY AND QUANTITY AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INTUITED AT THE SAME TIME IN DIFFERENT PLACES IS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY US IN HOLDING THEM TO BE NUMERICALLY DIFFERENT
WHO BY THE BY GAVE IT A PECULIAR FORM BY CAUSING THE PLAY OF IMAGES TO INTERVENE IN THE FORMATION OF THE FEELINGS HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS OF SLIGHT IMPORTANCE
BY THE SIDE OF EMOTION WE MAY PLACE AS DEMANDING THE SAME ANALYTICAL STUDY THE FEELING OF EFFORT WE OUGHT TO INQUIRE WITH EFFORT AS HAS BEEN DONE WITH EMOTION WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON
ARE NOTHING BUT RELATIONS AND IT IS ITSELF NOTHING MORE THAN A COMPLEX OF MERE RELATIONS SUBSTANCE IN SPACE WE ARE COGNIZANT OF ONLY THROUGH FORCES OPERATIVE IN IT EITHER DRAWING OTHERS TOWARDS ITSELF ATTRACTION
THEY ANNIHILATE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA
OF THE EQUIVOCAL NATURE OR AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION FROM THE CONFUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL WITH THE EMPIRICAL USE OF THE UNDERSTANDING REFLECTION REFLEXIO IS NOT OCCUPIED ABOUT OBJECTS THEMSELVES
ALWAYS SAID THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS MORE EASY THAN TO SOLVE SUCH OBVIOUS QUESTIONS AND THAT HE COULD INTERPRET A THOUSAND OF THEM WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION WERE HE INCLIN'D TO TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT SUCH TRIFLES
AS WE DO OUR SENSATIONS BUT WE CONSTANTLY CONSIDER THEM AS INDWELLING OR SUBJECTIVE STATES THIS RULE HOWEVER
OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITIES IS INCOGITABLE SUCH A RELATION THAT IS
AND CONSIDERS THEM THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNAL EXCITANT WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY THIS ELEGANT FORMULA
THE AENIGMAS OR RIDDLES ZADIG AS ONE BESIDE HIMSELF AND PERFECTLY THUNDER STRUCK BEAT HIS MARCH AT RANDOM HE ENTRED HOWEVER INTO THE CITY OF BABYLON
OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
THAT THE SENTIMENT LOVE FOR EXAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO A RIGHT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE BRAIN AND THE SENTIMENT HATRED TO A LEFT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT WE SHOULD THEN KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOVE A MOVEMENT IS PRODUCED IN ONE DIRECTION
UNDER THE FORM OF TACTILE MUSCULAR THERMAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS UNTIL NOW THIS CATEGORY OF PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED BECAUSE WE SAW IN IT EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE ROLE IN EMOTION ITSELF SEEMED SLIGHT
WITHOUT BEING EVER THANKFUL FOR IT WHICH WE ENJOY WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WE CAME BY IT WHICH WE GIVE AWAY TO OTHERS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TIS TO BE FOUND AND WHICH WE LOSE WITHOUT BEING ANY WAYS CONSCIOUS OF OUR MISFORTUNE
THIS THEORY HAS AT LEAST THE MERIT OF ORIGINALITY IT ALSO PLEASES ONE BY ITS GREAT CLEARNESS
WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN AND WHICH FORMS THE MORAL WORLD
OR THE ALMOST UNDEFINABLE ORGANIC TROUBLES REVEALED TO US BY THE SINGING IN THE EARS CONSTRICTION OF THE EPIGASTRIUM THE JERKS THE TREMBLING VERTIGO OR NAUSEA ALL THIS COLLECTION OF ORGANIC TROUBLES
CONSEQUENTLY SPACE AND TIME MUST ANTECEDE ALL PHENOMENA AND ALL DATA OF EXPERIENCE AND RATHER MAKE EXPERIENCE ITSELF POSSIBLE BUT THE INTELLECTUAL PHILOSOPHER COULD NOT ENDURE THAT THE FORM SHOULD PRECEDE THE THINGS THEMSELVES
NOW THE RELATIONS IN WHICH CONCEPTIONS CAN STAND TO EACH OTHER ARE THOSE OF IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINALLY OF THE DETERMINABLE AND THE DETERMINING MATTER AND FORM
LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON HIS BACK THEN HOLDING THE POINT OF HIS SWORD TO THE OPENING OF HIS CUIRASS SUBMIT TO BE STRIPP'D OF YOUR BORROW'D PLUMES OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN THIS MOMENT ITOBAD
DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS AFTER SENSATIONS AND IMAGES WE HAVE TO NAME AMONG THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE WHOLE SERIES OF AFFECTIVE STATES OUR PLEASURES AND OUR PAINS OUR JOYS AND OUR GRIEFS
IN REGARD TO JUSTICE THE SOVEREIGN GOOD
DECLARED THAT ALL SUBSTANCES EVEN THE COMPONENT PARTS OF MATTER WERE SIMPLE SUBSTANCES WITH POWERS OF REPRESENTATION IN ONE WORD MONADS FOUR MATTER AND FORM
DEPENDS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST COGITATE THESE RELATIONS BEFORE CONSTRUCTING ANY OBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT WE COMPARE THE CONCEPTIONS THAT ARE TO BE PLACED IN THE JUDGEMENT AND OBSERVE WHETHER THERE EXISTS IDENTITY OF MANY REPRESENTATIONS IN ONE CONCEPTION
THE FIRST AND TRADITIONAL ONE CONSISTS IN SEEING IN EMOTION A PHENOMENON SUI GENERIS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEAVES NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
OR THE REFLEX ACTION ON THE CIRCULATION THE PALLOR OR BLUSHING
NOW HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON WHAT THE ANGEL JESRAD HAD SAID TO HIM NAY HE REFLECTED SO FAR BACK AS THE STORY OF THE ARABIAN ATOM OF DUST METAMORPHOSED INTO A DIAMOND
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS SWAY'D BY LOVE AND JUSTICE EVERY ONE BLEST ZADIG AND ZADIG BLEST HEAV'N FOR HIS UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
AND THEREBY THROW NOT A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE QUESTION AS TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPER BUSINESS OF THE UNDERSTANDING ONE IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE WHEN AN OBJECT IS PRESENTED TO US SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS
THE LATTER THROUGH THE CONNECTION OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AS CAUSES AND EFFECTS AND SO WOULD IT REALLY BE IF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING WERE CAPABLE OF AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION TO OBJECTS AND IF SPACE AND TIME WERE DETERMINATIONS OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES
UPON HIS FORT AS THE SWORDS MEN CALL IT BY WHICH MEANS ITOBAD'S SWORD WAS SNAPT IN TWO WITH THAT ZADIG IN AN INSTANT CLOS'D HIS ADVERSARY AND BY HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH AS WELL AS SKILL
SAID ZADIG I WAS THE PERSON THAT HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING VICTOR AT YOUR CIRCUS THE WHITE ARMOUR MOST PUISSANT LORDS WAS MINE THAT AWKWARD WARRIOR THERE LORD ITOBAD DRESS'D HIMSELF IN IT WHILST I WAS ASLEEP
THE QUEEN AND HE ADOR'D THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ZADIG PERMITTED MISSOUF THE FAIR COQUET TO MAKE HER CONQUESTS WHERE SHE COULD HE SENT COURIERS TO BRING THE FREE BOOTER ARBOGAD TO COURT
HE IMAGIN'D IT IS PLAIN THAT IT WOULD DO HIM MORE HONOUR THAN HIS OWN GREEN ONE UNACCOUTRED AS I AM I AM READY BEFORE THIS AUGUST ASSEMBLY TO GIVE THEM INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF MY SUPERIOR SKILL
WHICH APPLIES TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES CONTAINS THE GROUND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND IS THEREFORE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER BECAUSE THE FACULTIES OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME
BUT VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN AS TO WHAT DISTINGUISHES AN EMOTION FROM A THOUGHT TWO PRINCIPAL OPINIONS MAY BE UPHELD IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FEELINGS WHEN WE ENDEAVOUR TO PENETRATE THEIR ESSENTIAL AND FINAL NATURE
BUT BEING MERELY SENSUOUS INTUITIONS IN WHICH WE DETERMINE ALL OBJECTS SOLELY AS PHENOMENA THE FORM OF INTUITION AS A SUBJECTIVE PROPERTY OF SENSIBILITY MUST ANTECEDE ALL MATTER SENSATIONS
AS WE DO OUR INDIFFERENT SENSATIONS THE SENSATIONS OF WEIGHT
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN THIS RESPECT PERFECTLY THE SAME
AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF THE EMOTIONS VIZ THAT OF JAMES
IS LIKEWISE AN INTELLECTUALIST SYSTEM THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION AS IT IS TAUGHT BY W JAMES SEEMS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR US WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESOLVE ALL INTELLECTUAL STATES INTO PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
ALL JUDGEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE EXAMINATION THAT IS INVESTIGATION INTO THE GROUNDS OF THEIR TRUTH FOR WHEN THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY CERTAIN FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO POINTS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE STRAIGHT LINE
THE FACT OF PERCEIVING SOMETHING TO PERCEIVE IS IN FACT THE PROPERTY OF INTELLIGENCE TO REASON TO IMAGINE TO JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND IS ALWAYS IN A CERTAIN SENSE TO PERCEIVE
HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT BEING PROPERLY ACCOUTRED WITH HIS HELMET HIS CUIRASS AND HIS BRACELETS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HUE DOWN AN ANTAGONIST IN HIS MANTLE AND CAP AND NOTHING TO SKREEN HIM FROM HIS RESENTMENT BUT A SINGLE SABRE
OR TO THE SENSES MANY JUDGEMENTS ARE ADMITTED TO BE TRUE FROM MERE HABIT OR INCLINATION BUT BECAUSE REFLECTION NEITHER PRECEDES NOR FOLLOWS
COMFORTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING HER AFFECTIONATE INTENTION TO SHORTEN HIS NOSE FOR HE SOOTH'D THEIR SORROWS BY VERY MUNIFICENT PRESENTS THE ENVIOUS INFORMER INDEED
HAPPENED TO DISCOVER ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
THEY PROCEED FROM THE FACT THAT STUDIES ON THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL VERY LITTLE ADVANCED THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THESE STATES ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND THEIR PSYCHICAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY DESCRIBED
IN A CONCEPTION OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING THE MATTER PRECEDES THE FORM AND FOR THIS REASON
YOU MUST PUT A STORM A CATACLYSM OF NATURE AND INSTEAD OF SUPPOSING THIS STORM OUTSIDE US LET IT BURST WITHIN US LET IT REACH US NOT BY THE OUTER SENSES OF SIGHT AND CONDITION BUT BY THE INNER SENSES
SHE COULDN'T CONCEIVE WHY ZADIG SHOULD APPEAR WITHOUT HIS ACCOUTREMENTS NOR IMAGINE WHICH WAY ITOBAD COULD PROCURE THE SNOW WHITE ARMOUR AT THE SIGHT OF ZADIG A CONFUS'D MURMUR RAN THRO THE WHOLE PLACE
THIS IS NOT A CHANGE IN ORDER ONLY IT IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS THE CHANGE IS DIRECTED TO THE NATURE OF EMOTION IT IS CONSIDERED TO EXIST IN THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS INDICATED ABOVE
IF A GENERAL JUDGEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR DIFFERENCE IF A PARTICULAR WHETHER THERE IS AGREEMENT WHEN AFFIRMATIVE AND OPPOSITION WHEN NEGATIVE JUDGEMENTS ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND SO ON FOR THIS REASON WE OUGHT TO CALL THESE CONCEPTIONS
WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS ATTENDED HIM TO THE PALACE GATE THE QUEEN WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS ARRIVAL WAS IN THE UTMOST AGONY BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR HER VEXATION HAD ALMOST BROUGHT HER TO DEATH'S DOOR
WHAT WE THEN PERCEIVE WILL BE AN EMOTION SUCH IS THE THEORY THAT TWO AUTHORS
HOWEVER SIMILAR AND EQUAL ONE MAY BE TO ANOTHER TWO AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION WHEN REALITY IS REPRESENTED BY THE PURE UNDERSTANDING REALITAS NOUMENON
I WHO COMPLAIN I WHO HOPE IT IS TRUE THAT THIS ATTRIBUTION IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA FOR IT HAPPENS THAT WE PUT A PART OF OUR EGO INTO MATERIAL OBJECTS SUCH AS OUR BODIES
EACH PASS'D HIS VERDICT ZADIG WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT CONCLUDED IT WAS LIFE HE SOLV'D EVERY A ENIGMA PROPOS'D WITH EQUAL FACILITY ITOBAD WHEN HE HEARD THE EXPLICATIONS
THAT HE'D MAKE A PUBLICK EXAMPLE OF HIM IF HE FOLLOW'D HIS PROFESSION OF FREE BOOTING FOR THE FUTURE
SOFTEN'D THE RIGOUR OF THE SENTENCE AND TOOK THE MONEY ONLY IN FULL OF ALL ACCOUNTS HE DIDN'T LEAVE SO MUCH AS SEMIRA WHOLLY DISCONSOLATE THO SHE HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO A BLIND EYE NOR AZORA
OR IT IS THE HEART WHICH HASTENS OR SLACKENS ITS BEATS OR MAKES THEM IRREGULAR OR ENFEEBLES OR AUGMENTS THEM OR THE RESPIRATION WHICH CHANGES ITS RHYTHM OR INCREASES OR IS SUSPENDED
THE DWARF THO DUMB WAS NOT WHOLLY FORGOTTEN THE FISHERMAN WAS PUT INTO THE POSSESSION OF A VERY HANDSOME HOUSE
THAT IS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HENCE WITH HIM SPACE AND TIME WERE POSSIBLE
WHO AFTER SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES NOW TASTED THE SWEETS OF SEEING HER DARLING ZADIG THOUGHT WORTHY IN THE OPINION OF THE WHOLE WORLD
WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT FOR INSTANCE DESIRE REPRESENT A COMPLEMENT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS
AND ORCAN WAS SENTENC'D NOT ONLY TO PAY HIM A VERY CONSIDERABLE SUM FOR THE INJUSTICE DONE HIM IN DETAINING HIS WIFE BUT TO RESIGN HER LIKEWISE TO THE PROPER OWNER THE FISHERMAN HOWEVER GROWN WISE BY EXPERIENCE
NOTHING PASSES SO SLOWLY AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN EXPECTATION AND NOTHING SO SWIFT AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN THE PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF HIS WISHES IT'S EXTENT IS TO INFINITY IN THE WHOLE
THUS WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE THINGS ARE IDENTICAL OR DIFFERENT IN AGREEMENT OR OPPOSITION ET CETERA
BOTH IN A TRANSCENDENTAL SENSE ABSTRACTION BEING MADE OF EVERY DIFFERENCE IN THAT WHICH IS GIVEN AND OF THE MODE IN WHICH IT IS DETERMINED LOGICIANS FORMERLY TERMED THE UNIVERSAL MATTER THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE OF THIS OR THAT PART OF THE UNIVERSAL FORM
THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL OTHER REFLECTION SO INSEPARABLY ARE THEY CONNECTED WITH EVERY MODE OF EXERCISING THE UNDERSTANDING THE FORMER DENOTES THE DETERMINABLE IN GENERAL THE SECOND ITS DETERMINATION
TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION IS A DUTY WHICH NO ONE CAN NEGLECT WHO WISHES TO ESTABLISH AN A PRIORI JUDGEMENT UPON THINGS WE SHALL NOW PROCEED TO FULFIL THIS DUTY
OF HIS POMPOUS HELMET HIS SUPERB CUIRASS HIS RICH BRACELETS HIS BRILLIANT CUISSES OR ARMOUR FOR HIS THIGHS AND OTHER MARTIAL ACCOUTREMENTS WHEN ZADIG HAD EQUIPP'D HIMSELF CAP A PEE IN HIS NOW RECOVER'D ARMOUR
IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT EMOTION IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A PERCEPTION OF A CERTAIN KIND AN INTELLECTUAL ACT STRICTLY COMPARABLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A LANDSCAPE ONLY IN THE PLACE OF A LANDSCAPE WITH PLACID FEATURES
ARE THE MATTER THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE CONNECTED IN THE OBJECT THE FORM IN RESPECT TO THINGS IN GENERAL UNLIMITED REALITY WAS REGARDED AS THE MATTER OF ALL POSSIBILITY THE LIMITATION THEREOF NEGATION AS THE FORM
SOME STRONG CONTRACTION OR SOME RESPIRATORY TROUBLE AND YIELDS IF WE RENDER THE RESPIRATION AGAIN REGULAR AND PUT THE MUSCLES BACK INTO REPOSE TO MY GREAT REGRET
IS INFINITELY INTERESTING AND LEADS TO A FAIRLY CLEAR CONCEPTION BY WHICH EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED BY A MECHANISM REFLECTED IN A MIRROR WHICH IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WE REMAIN PERPLEXED
PLURALITY AND NUMERICAL DIFFERENCE ARE GIVEN BY SPACE ITSELF AS THE CONDITION OF EXTERNAL PHENOMENA FOR ONE PART OF SPACE ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE PERFECTLY SIMILAR AND EQUAL TO ANOTHER PART IS STILL WITHOUT IT AND FOR THIS REASON ALONE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LATTER
AND EVEN INTO OBJECTS SEPARATE FROM OUR BODIES AND WHOSE SOLE RELATION TO US IS THAT OF A LEGAL PROPRIETORSHIP WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT FREQUENT ERROR OF IDENTIFYING THE EGO WITH THE PSYCHICAL
AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS CLEARNESS OF PERCEPTION IS NOT SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL WHETHER AFFECTIVITY EMOTIVITY TENDENCY WILL ARE REALLY ALL REDUCED TO PERCEPTIONS OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT RATHER IRREDUCIBLE ELEMENTS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY OBTAINING CONCEPTIONS OF THEM BUT IS THAT STATE OF THE MIND IN WHICH WE SET OURSELVES TO DISCOVER THE SUBJECTIVE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OBTAIN CONCEPTIONS IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE RELATION OF GIVEN REPRESENTATIONS
IT USED TO BE SAID I PERCEIVE A DANGER I AM FRIGHTENED I TREMBLE NOW WE MUST SAY I TREMBLE BEFORE A DANGER FIRST AND IT IS AFTER HAVING TREMBLED THAT I AM FRIGHTENED
AND WHEN WE HATE IN ANOTHER BUT THE WHY WOULD REMAIN WITHOUT AN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF KNOWING WHAT PLACE IN OUR METAPHYSICAL THEORY WE OUGHT TO SECURE FOR EMOTION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN EFFORT WOULD THEN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN TO RECEIVE ALL THESE CENTRIPETAL SENSATIONS AND WHAT PROVES THIS IS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EFFORT WHEN MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MUSCULAR ENERGY
FOR IN IT NO ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF THE FACULTY OF COGNITION TO WHICH THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS BELONG AND THEY ARE CONSEQUENTLY AS FAR AS REGARDS THEIR ORIGIN TO BE TREATED AS HOMOGENEOUS WHILE TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
BUT WHAT OTHER INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES OF SUCH AN OBJECT CAN I THINK THAN THOSE WHICH MY INTERNAL SENSE PRESENTS TO ME THAT TO WIT
CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
TOGETHER WITH THE FAIR ALMONZA HIS NEW BRIDE
AND WITHOUT WHICH NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WHICH IN A WORD DEVOURS EVERY THING HOW MINUTE SOEVER AND YET GIVES LIFE AND SPIRIT TO EVERY OBJECT OR BEING HOWEVER GREAT ITOBAD
OR ELSE IT IS THE SECRETION OF THE SALIVA OR OF THE SWEAT WHICH FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE OR DRIES UP OR THE MUSCULAR FORCE WHICH IS INCREASED OR DECAYS
ZADIG DREW HIS SWORD AND SALUTED THE QUEEN WITH IT WHO VIEW'D HIM WITH TRANSPORT MIX'D WITH FEAR ITOBAD DREW HIS BUT PAID HIS COMPLIMENTS TO NOBODY
AND WE EVEN FIND SOME PLEASURE IN LEAVING IT IN SUSPENSE IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A METAPHYSICIAN IS NOT COMPELLED TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BESIDES THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH ATOP US HERE ARE PECULIARLY OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL ORDER
IN AN OBJECT OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING ONLY THAT IS INTERNAL WHICH HAS NO RELATION AS REGARDS ITS EXISTENCE TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIA PHAENOMENON IN SPACE
THAT THE WHITE ARMOUR WAS ZADIG'S PROPERTY HE WAS THEREUPON ACKNOWLEDG'D KING OF BABYLON BY THE UNANIMOUS CONTENT OF THE WHOLE COURT BUT MORE PARTICULARLY
TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
PRINCIPIUM IDENTATIS INDISCERNIBILIUM IS NOT TO BE IMPUGNED BUT AS PHENOMENA ARE OBJECTS OF SENSIBILITY AND AS THE UNDERSTANDING IN RESPECT OF THEM MUST BE EMPLOYED EMPIRICALLY AND NOT PURELY OR TRANSCENDENTALLY
THE TRANSLATION AND THE DISTANT EFFECTS OF THE EMOTIONS CONSTITUTE THEIR ESSENTIAL BASE THESE EFFECTS ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY THE GESTURE THE CRY AND THE SPEECH
ON THAT VERY DAY WHEN THOSE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ENGAG'D IN THE LIST OR CIRCUS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE SPACIOUS OUTER COURT OF THE PALACE
BY WHICH ONE THING IS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANOTHER ACCORDING TO TRANSCENDENTAL CONCEPTIONS THE UNDERSTANDING DEMANDS THAT SOMETHING BE GIVEN AT LEAST IN THE CONCEPTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IT IN A CERTAIN MANNER HENCE
ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES
THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
THE PROPER DETERMINATION OF THESE RELATIONS RESTS ON THE QUESTION TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION THEY SUBJECTIVELY BELONG WHETHER TO SENSIBILITY OR UNDERSTANDING FOR ON THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SOLVE THIS QUESTION
AND DETERMINE THEIR POSSIBILITY AN OBJECTION PERFECTLY CORRECT IF WE ASSUME THAT WE INTUITE THINGS AS THEY ARE ALTHOUGH WITH CONFUSED REPRESENTATION
AS IN THE CASE OF TWO MOVING FORCES IN THE SAME STRAIGHT LINE DRAWING OR IMPELLING A POINT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OR IN THE CASE OF A PLEASURE COUNTERBALANCING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PAIN THREE THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL
WHAT IS THE LONGEST AND YET THE SHORTEST THING IN THE WORLD THE MOST SWIFT AND THE MOST SLOW THE MOST DIVISIBLE AND THE MOST EXTENDED THE LEAST VALU'D AND THE MOST REGRETTED
THO ANOTHER APPEARS CLAD IN MY ARMOUR BUT IN THE MEAN TIME BEFORE I CAN POSSIBLY PROVE MY ASSERTION I INSIST UPON BEING ADMITTED INTO COURT
THUS IN THE CASE OF TWO DROPS OF WATER
DIED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION THE EMPIRE WAS GLORIOUS ABROAD AND IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF TRANQUILITY PEACE AND PLENTY AT HOME THIS IN SHORT WAS THE TRUE GOLDEN AGE
ON THE OTHER HAND THE REAL IN A PHENOMENON REALITAS PHAENOMENON MAY VERY WELL BE IN MUTUAL OPPOSITION AND WHEN UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT THE ONE MAY COMPLETELY OR IN PART ANNIHILATE THE EFFECT OR CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER
SO THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF EFFORT WHICH LIKEWISE TENDS TO BRING BACK ALL WILL TO INTELLIGENCE IT IS AGAIN THE SAME AUTHOR THAT TRUE GENIUS W JAMES WHO HAS ATTEMPTED THIS REDUCTION
COMPARATIO BUT ONLY BY DISTINGUISHING THE MODE OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG IN OTHER WORDS BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION WE MAY THEREFORE WITH JUSTICE SAY THAT LOGICAL REFLECTION IS MERE COMPARISON
WHICH APPEAR TO US AS PERCEIVED BY US BUT AS BEING OTHER THAN OURSELVES ON THE CONTRARY WE CONSTANTLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION REFER OUR EMOTIONAL STATES TO OUR EGO IT IS I WHO SUFFER WE SAY
CONCEPTIONS OF COMPARISON CONCEPTUS COMPARATIONIS
TO THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OR FACULTIES OF COGNITION BY WHICH ALONE THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER CAN BE RIGHTLY DETERMINED THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH OCCURS IN CONSIDERING OUR REPRESENTATIONS IS TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION DO THEY BELONG TO THE UNDERSTANDING
AS REPRESENTING THE ESSENCE OF MIND ON THIS POINT I WILL RECALL THE FINE IRONICAL IMAGE USED BY TYNDALL THE ILLUSTRIOUS ENGLISH PHYSICIST TO SHOW THE ABYSS WHICH SEPARATES THOUGHT FROM THE MOLECULAR STATES OF THE BRAIN LET US SUPPOSE HE SAYS
SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
AND YOU'RE THE LAST ABOVE BOARD OF THAT SAME MEDDLING CREW AND YOU HAVE THE DAVY JONES'S INSOLENCE TO UP AND STAND FOR CAP'N OVER ME YOU THAT SANK THE LOT OF US
BUT THAT'S A TRIFLE YOU LOOK THERE THAT'S WHY AND HE CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR A PAPER THAT I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED NONE OTHER THAN THE CHART ON YELLOW PAPER
PERHAPS NO MAN ALIVE COULD TELL YET THERE WERE STILL THREE UPON THAT ISLAND SILVER AND OLD MORGAN AND BEN GUNN WHO HAD EACH TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THESE CRIMES AS EACH HAD HOPED IN VAIN TO SHARE IN THE REWARD
I'VE STILL A SHOT IN MY LOCKER THE DOOR OPENED AND THE FIVE MEN STANDING HUDDLED TOGETHER JUST INSIDE PUSHED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER FORWARD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMICAL TO SEE HIS SLOW ADVANCE
SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
YOU'RE HIM THAT NEVER BUNGLED NOTHING YOU WOODEN HEADED LUBBER DIG AWAY BOYS SAID SILVER WITH THE COOLEST INSOLENCE YOU'LL FIND SOME PIG NUTS AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER PIG NUTS REPEATED MERRY IN A SCREAM MATES DO YOU HEAR THAT
LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
CRIED THE ACCUSED WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW FOR HE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE
BUT THIS TOPS THE STIFFEST YARN TO NOTHING SILVER PAUSED AND I COULD SEE BY THE FACES OF GEORGE AND HIS LATE COMRADES THAT THESE WORDS HAD NOT BEEN SAID IN VAIN THAT'S FOR NUMBER ONE
AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THAT HE HAD A BOOK AS WELL AS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND WAS STILL WONDERING HOW ANYTHING SO INCONGRUOUS HAD COME IN THEIR POSSESSION WHEN THE KNEELING FIGURE ROSE ONCE MORE TO HIS FEET
AND NOW SHIPMATES THIS BLACK SPOT TAIN'T MUCH GOOD NOW IS IT DICK'S CROSSED HIS LUCK AND SPOILED HIS BIBLE AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL IT'LL DO TO KISS THE BOOK ON STILL WON'T IT GROWLED DICK WHO WAS EVIDENTLY
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHART WAS INCREDIBLE TO THE SURVIVING MUTINEERS THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE CATS UPON A MOUSE IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND ONE TEARING IT FROM ANOTHER AND BY THE OATHS AND THE CRIES AND THE CHILDISH LAUGHTER WITH WHICH THEY ACCOMPANIED THEIR EXAMINATION
AND THE TREASURE IN THE HOLD OF HER BY THUNDER WELL WHO CROSSED ME
BUT CIVIL YOU CAN SPEAK AND SHALL GEORGE MERRY YOU MAY LAY TO THAT
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
YOU'LL ALL SWING NOW I RECKON WHAT SOFT HEADED LUBBER HAD A BIBLE IT WAS DICK SAID ONE DICK WAS IT THEN DICK CAN GET TO PRAYERS SAID SILVER
BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
KILL THAT BOY NOT ME MATES AND NUMBER THREE AH WELL THERE'S A DEAL TO SAY TO NUMBER THREE MAYBE YOU DON'T COUNT IT NOTHING TO HAVE A REAL COLLEGE DOCTOR TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY YOU JOHN WITH YOUR HEAD BROKE
WELL WHAT IS IT ANYWAY AH DEPOSED' THAT'S IT IS IT VERY PRETTY WROTE TO BE SURE LIKE PRINT I SWEAR YOUR HAND O WRITE GEORGE
AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
SO THAT'S THE TOON IS IT CRIED THE COOK GEORGE I RECKON YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN FRIEND AND LUCKY FOR YOU AS I'M NOT A REVENGEFUL MAN BUT
NOW THAT'S ABOUT WHERE WE ARE EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF US THANKS TO HIM AND HANDS AND ANDERSON AND OTHER RUINATION FOOLS OF YOU
TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
WHO'S THAT SAYS ONE THAT WHY THAT'S JOHN SILVER I KNOWED HIM WELL SAYS ANOTHER AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CHAINS A JANGLE AS YOU GO ABOUT AND REACH FOR THE OTHER BUOY
AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
I MADE A HASH O THIS CRUISE DID I WELL NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANTED AND YOU ALL KNOW IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT WE'D A BEEN ABOARD THE HISPANIOLA THIS NIGHT AS EVER WAS EVERY MAN OF US ALIVE AND FIT AND FULL OF GOOD PLUM DUFF
ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
OH REPLIED GEORGE YOU DON'T BE UNDER NO KIND OF APPREHENSION WE'RE ALL SQUARE WE ARE FIRST YOU'VE MADE A HASH OF THIS CRUISE YOU'LL BE A BOLD MAN TO SAY NO TO THAT SECOND
A BIBLE WITH A BIT CUT OUT RETURNED SILVER DERISIVELY NOT IT
I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
IT WAS A LARGE AIRY PLACE WITH A LITTLE SPRING AND A POOL OF CLEAR WATER OVERHUNG WITH FERNS THE FLOOR WAS SAND BEFORE A BIG FIRE LAY CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AND IN A FAR CORNER ONLY DUSKILY FLICKERED OVER BY THE BLAZE
ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
ONE HELD THE LIGHT ANOTHER WAS ON HIS KNEES IN THEIR MIDST AND I SAW THE BLADE OF AN OPEN KNIFE SHINE IN HIS HAND WITH VARYING COLOURS IN THE MOON AND TORCHLIGHT
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
NOW I GIVE YOU WARNING GEORGE HE CRIED ONE MORE WORD OF YOUR SAUCE AND I'LL CALL YOU DOWN AND FIGHT YOU HOW WHY HOW DO I KNOW
THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
THE WIND BROUGHT US A NOISE BETWEEN SHRIEKING AND SINGING IT WAS ONLY A SNATCH THAT REACHED OUR EARS FOLLOWED BY THE FORMER SILENCE HEAVEN FORGIVE THEM SAID THE DOCTOR TIS THE MUTINEERS
I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
HE'S SEEN HIS SLICE OF LUCK HAS DICK AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT BUT HERE THE LONG MAN WITH THE YELLOW EYES STRUCK IN
HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
YOU WANT TO PLAY BOOTY THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU AND THEN FOURTH THERE'S THIS HERE BOY IS THAT ALL ASKED SILVER QUIETLY ENOUGH TOO RETORTED GEORGE
WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
WE'RE THAT NEAR THE GIBBET THAT MY NECK'S STIFF WITH THINKING ON IT YOU'VE SEEN EM MAYBE HANGED IN CHAINS BIRDS ABOUT EM
MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
AH IT'S A FINE DANCE I'M WITH YOU THERE AND LOOKS MIGHTY LIKE A HORNPIPE IN A ROPE'S END AT EXECUTION DOCK BY LONDON TOWN IT DOES BUT WHO DONE IT WHY IT WAS ANDERSON AND HANDS AND YOU GEORGE MERRY
HESITATING AS HE SET DOWN EACH FOOT BUT HOLDING HIS CLOSED RIGHT HAND IN FRONT OF HIM STEP UP LAD CRIED SILVER I WON'T EAT YOU
YOU LET THE ENEMY OUT O THIS HERE TRAP FOR NOTHING WHY DID THEY WANT OUT
YOU'LL BE CAP'N NEXT I SHOULDN'T WONDER JUST OBLIGE ME WITH THAT TORCH AGAIN WILL YOU THIS PIPE DON'T DRAW
FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
ONE SIDE WAS BLANK FOR IT HAD BEEN THE LAST LEAF THE OTHER CONTAINED A VERSE OR TWO OF REVELATION THESE WORDS AMONG THE REST WHICH STRUCK SHARPLY HOME UPON MY MIND WITHOUT ARE DOGS AND MURDERERS
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
MIGHTY PRETTY SAID GEORGE BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET AWAY WITH IT AND US NO SHIP SILVER SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH A HAND AGAINST THE WALL
A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
AND THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS THE HOUSE HERE THEY COME SAID I AND I RETURNED TO MY FORMER POSITION FOR IT SEEMED BENEATH MY DIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD FIND ME WATCHING THEM WELL LET EM COME LAD LET EM COME
WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
ARE WE A GOING TO WASTE A HOSTAGE NO NOT US
BUT WERE AT SEA WITH IT BESIDES IN SAFETY YES SAID ONE THAT'S FLINT SURE ENOUGH J F AND A SCORE BELOW WITH A CLOVE HITCH TO IT SO HE DONE EVER
THIRD YOU WOULDN'T LET US GO AT THEM UPON THE MARCH
WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
YOU'RE A FUNNY MAN BY YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOU'RE OVER NOW AND YOU'LL MAYBE STEP DOWN OFF THAT BARREL AND HELP VOTE I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNOWED THE RULES RETURNED SILVER CONTEMPTUOUSLY
WE'LL ALL SWING AND SUN DRY FOR YOUR BUNGLING
DON'T IT THOUGH CRIED DICK WITH A SORT OF JOY WELL I RECKON THAT'S WORTH HAVING TOO HERE JIM HERE'S A CUR'OSITY FOR YOU SAID SILVER AND HE TOSSED ME THE PAPER
TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
AND THIS EMISSARY RETIRED AGAIN LEAVING US TOGETHER IN THE DARK THERE'S A BREEZE COMING JIM SAID SILVER WHO HAD BY THIS TIME ADOPTED QUITE A FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR TONE I TURNED TO THE LOOPHOLE NEAREST ME AND LOOKED OUT
AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU SPAVIN SHE SAID AND THAT ON THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM DAY MY BROTHER SIR PITT
WHICH HAD GROWN WOEFULLY SHABBY AND WAS MUCH TOO TIGHT HE WAS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE PROCESSION AND WAITED UPON HIS SOVEREIGN IN A CAB BUT THAT HIS GOOD NATURED SISTER IN LAW INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE A FAMILY PARTY THE COACH WAS LARGE
ANSWERED MISSUS RAWDON PLAINTIVELY AND SHE RUBBED HER CHEEK WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF TO SHOW THERE WAS NO ROUGE AT ALL ONLY GENUINE BLUSHES AND MODESTY IN HER CASE ABOUT THIS WHO CAN TELL
THE PARTICULARS OF BECKY'S COSTUME WERE IN THE NEWSPAPERS FEATHERS LAPPETS SUPERB DIAMONDS AND ALL THE REST LADY CRACKENBURY READ THE PARAGRAPH IN BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND DISCOURSED TO HER FOLLOWERS
AND IN WHICH BECKY KEPT A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND PERHAPS VALUABLE THINGS
AND TO TRIP DOWN AGAIN TO WAIT UPON THE GREAT PEER SHE FOUND HIM GRINNING OVER THE BOWL SHE WAS DISCOVERED AND SHE BLUSHED A LITTLE THANK YOU MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
AND AUDACIOUSLY ABOUT THE SACRED AUDIENCE CHAMBER BUT TO BACK AWAY RAPIDLY SILENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY MAKING PROFOUND BOWS OUT OF THE AUGUST PRESENCE THIS MAY BE SAID
HE SAID GOOD NATUREDLY YOU SILLY LITTLE FIBSTER I HEARD YOU IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WHERE I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WERE PUTTING A LITTLE ROUGE ON YOU MUST GIVE SOME OF YOURS TO MY LADY GAUNT WHOSE COMPLEXION IS QUITE PREPOSTEROUS
YOU HAVE ONLY SOME OF THE BEST BLOOD IN ENGLAND IN YOUR VEINS AND GOOD PRINCIPLES AND PIETY FOR YOUR PORTION I MYSELF THE WIFE OF A BARONET'S YOUNGER BROTHER TOO NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS GOING TO COURT NOR WOULD OTHER PEOPLE
IN WHICH THE READER IS INTRODUCED TO THE VERY BEST OF COMPANY AT LAST BECKY'S KINDNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE CHIEF OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY
AS IF SHE WERE A PRINCESS AND ACCUSTOMED ALL HER LIFE TO GO TO COURT SMILING GRACIOUSLY ON THE FOOTMAN AT THE DOOR AND ON SIR PITT WHO FOLLOWED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE THEN RAWDON FOLLOWED IN HIS OLD GUARDS UNIFORM
BE IT OUR REASONABLE BOAST TO OUR CHILDREN THAT WE SAW GEORGE THE GOOD THE MAGNIFICENT THE GREAT WELL THERE CAME A HAPPY DAY IN MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY'S EXISTENCE
SHOULD SHE PAY OFF OLD BRIGGS AND GIVE HER HER CONGE SHOULD SHE ASTONISH RAGGLES BY SETTLING HIS ACCOUNT SHE TURNED OVER ALL THESE THOUGHTS ON HER PILLOW
AS LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET AND ONE OF THE GREAT DIGNITARIES AND ILLUSTRIOUS DEFENCES OF THE THRONE OF ENGLAND AND CAME UP WITH ALL HIS STARS GARTERS COLLARS AND CORDONS AND PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE WOMAN
THEN SHE ROSE UP WITH THE QUEEREST EXPRESSION OF VICTORIOUS MISCHIEF GLITTERING IN HER GREEN EYES
THERE CAME TWO NOTES FROM GAUNT HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN THE ONE CONTAINING A CARD OF INVITATION FROM LORD AND LADY STEYNE TO A DINNER AT GAUNT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY WHILE THE OTHER ENCLOSED A SLIP OF GRAY PAPER BEARING LORD STEYNE'S SIGNATURE AND THE ADDRESS OF MESSRS JONES
AND MAKE THEIR CURTSEY TO THE SOVEREIGN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF LAMPLIGHT OUR BELOVED REBECCA HAD NO NEED HOWEVER OF ANY SUCH A FRIENDLY HALO TO SET OFF HER BEAUTY
I KNOW THERE IS SOME ROUGE THAT WON'T COME OFF ON A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME SO GOOD THAT EVEN TEARS WILL NOT DISTURB IT WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TWIDDLING ROUND HIS WIFE'S CARD YOU ARE BENT ON BECOMING A FINE LADY
AND FORGOT THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE CHEST AT HOME DUNS ROUND THE GATE TRADESMEN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE NO GROUND TO WALK UPON IN A WORD AND AS SHE WENT TO COURT IN THE CARRIAGE THE FAMILY CARRIAGE
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
THEN SHE WALKED TO MISTER RAGGLES INQUIRED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN AFFECTIONATELY AND GAVE HIM FIFTY POUNDS ON ACCOUNT THEN SHE WENT TO THE LIVERY MAN FROM WHOM SHE JOBBED HER CARRIAGES AND GRATIFIED HIM WITH A SIMILAR SUM
PASSES SHOULD APPEAR ABROAD AT NIGHT ALONE IF EVEN CYNTHIA LOOKS HAGGARD OF AN AFTERNOON AS WE MAY SEE HER SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENT WINTER SEASON
SAID THE PEER WITH AN OATH AND BECKY REFLECTING ON THE LARGENESS OF HIS MEANS MENTIONED NOT ONLY THE SUM WHICH SHE HAD BORROWED FROM MISS BRIGGS BUT ONE OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THIS CAUSED THE LORD STEYNE TO BREAK OUT IN ANOTHER BRIEF AND ENERGETIC EXPRESSION OF ANGER
SOME FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT COSTUME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BEAUTY OF THE PRESENT SEASON A SCORE OF YEARS HENCE THAT TOO THAT MILLINER'S WONDER WILL HAVE PASSED INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ABSURD
AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT ALL THE DIAMONDS WHICH GO TO COURT BELONG TO THE WEARERS LIKE THOSE BEAUTIFUL STONES WHICH LADY JANE HAS AND WHICH ARE MUCH HANDSOMER THAN ANY WHICH I HAVE I AM CERTAIN
YOU'LL BE ASKED TO DINNER NEXT WEEK AND GARE AUX FEMMES LOOK OUT AND HOLD YOUR OWN HOW THE WOMEN WILL BULLY YOU THIS WAS A VERY LONG SPEECH FOR A MAN OF FEW WORDS LIKE MY LORD STEYNE
AS SHE LOOKED AT HER KINSWOMAN AND OWNED SORROWFULLY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS QUITE INFERIOR IN TASTE TO MISSUS BECKY
SOME FAINTED WITH EMOTION PEOPLE WERE SUFFOCATED IN THE PIT SHRIEKS AND GROANS RISING UP AMIDST THE WRITHING AND SHOUTING MASS THERE OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE AND INDEED SHOWED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO BE READY TO DIE FOR HIM
AND ORDERED THE FINEST PORTRAIT OF HIM THAT ART HAD PRODUCED AND CREDIT COULD SUPPLY SHE CHOSE THAT FAMOUS ONE IN WHICH THE BEST OF MONARCHS IS REPRESENTED IN A FROCK COAT
AS THIS OLD CYNIC ALWAYS DID AT ANY NAIVE DISPLAY OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BECKY CAME DOWN TO HIM PRESENTLY
SO TO BE AND TO BE THOUGHT A RESPECTABLE WOMAN WAS BECKY'S AIM IN LIFE AND SHE GOT UP THE GENTEEL WITH AMAZING ASSIDUITY READINESS AND SUCCESS WE HAVE SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE A FINE LADY
THE HYPOCRITE BEING ACTED ELLISTON BEING MANAGER DOWTON AND LISTON PERFORMERS TWO BOYS HAD LEAVE FROM THEIR LOYAL MASTERS TO GO OUT FROM SLAUGHTER HOUSE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED
YOU MAY GO AND DINE WITH THEM AS YOU LIKE YOUR RUBBER BUT I MUSTN'T AND WON'T
THE LADIES NOT VERY BIG THEY WOULD HOLD THEIR TRAINS IN THEIR LAPS FINALLY THE FOUR WENT FRATERNALLY TOGETHER AND THEIR CARRIAGE PRESENTLY JOINED THE LINE OF ROYAL EQUIPAGES WHICH WAS MAKING ITS WAY DOWN PICCADILLY
WHICH OTHERS ARE SLOW TO PERCEIVE HOW FOR INSTANCE COMUS FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE GREATEST TRAGIC ACTOR IN ENGLAND HOW BROWN THE FAMOUS NOVELIST LONGS TO BE CONSIDERED NOT A MAN OF GENIUS BUT A MAN OF FASHION
AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
AS SHE SAT AT WORK AND SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO SHE RATTLED AWAY A TRIUMPHANT VOLUNTARY ON THE KEYS WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE PAUSE UNDER HER WINDOW TO LISTEN TO HER BRILLIANT MUSIC THAT NIGHT
IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF THAT ABOMINABLE SHEEP DOG SAID LORD STEYNE WITH A SAVAGE LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HER
AND I HEARD THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN AND THEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
NEVER WENT BACK TO MISTER POLONIUS OF COVENTRY STREET AND THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER APPLIED FOR THEIR RESTORATION BUT THEY RETIRED INTO A LITTLE PRIVATE REPOSITORY IN AN OLD DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO
YOU WILL GO TO GAUNT HOUSE YOU GIVE AN OLD FELLOW NO REST UNTIL YOU GET THERE IT'S NOT HALF SO NICE AS HERE YOU'LL BE BORED THERE I AM MY WIFE IS AS GAY AS LADY MACBETH AND MY DAUGHTERS AS CHEERFUL AS REGAN AND GONERIL
MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
YOU POOR LITTLE EARTHENWARE PIPKIN YOU WANT TO SWIM DOWN THE STREAM ALONG WITH THE GREAT COPPER KETTLES
MISSUS RAWDON AT LENGTH HAD PITY UPON HER ADMIRER AND CALLING TO BRIGGS PRAISED THE FINENESS OF THE WEATHER TO HER AND BADE HER TO TAKE OUT THE CHILD FOR A WALK I CAN'T SEND HER AWAY BECKY SAID PRESENTLY
AS IT MAY BE SEEN OF AN EARLY MORNING WHEN HALF THE LAMPS ARE OUT AND THE OTHERS ARE BLINKING WANLY AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO VANISH LIKE GHOSTS BEFORE THE DAWN SUCH CHARMS
WHICH WAS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AND THEN EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF THE ANCIENT BROCADE WHICH FORMED THE MATERIAL OF MISSUS RAWDON'S COURT DRESS SHE FELT INCLINED TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH FINE CLOTHING BUT CHECKED THAT SPEECH WITH AN EFFORT
NOR WAS IT THE FIRST WHICH HE UTTERED FOR BECKY'S BENEFIT ON THAT DAY BRIGGS LOOKED UP FROM THE WORK TABLE AT WHICH SHE WAS SEATED IN THE FARTHER ROOM AND GAVE A DEEP SIGH
IT DOES NOT BECOME SUCH A FEEBLE AND INEXPERIENCED PEN AS MINE TO ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE DAZZLED EYES CLOSE BEFORE THAT MAGNIFICENT IDEA LOYAL RESPECT AND DECENCY TELL EVEN THE IMAGINATION NOT TO LOOK TOO KEENLY
AND WE HAD NECK OF MUTTON AND TURNIPS
KNEW WHENCE THE JEWELS CAME AND WHO PAID FOR THEM AS HE BOWED OVER HER HE SMILED
AND TO APPEAR ON DRURY LANE STAGE AMONGST A CROWD WHICH ASSEMBLED THERE TO GREET THE KING THE KING THERE HE WAS BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET
AND PRESENTLY SIR PITT ISSUED FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AGAIN LEADING FORTH A LADY WITH GRAND FEATHERS COVERED IN A WHITE SHAWL AND HOLDING UP DAINTILY A TRAIN OF MAGNIFICENT BROCADE SHE STEPPED INTO THE VEHICLE
HOW SOON AT THE APPEARANCE OF THESE GRAND COURT CARDS DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK STEYNE BAREACRES JOHNES OF HELVELLYN AND CAERYLON OF CAMELOT
MANY A LADY WHOSE REPUTATION WOULD BE DOUBTFUL OTHERWISE AND LIABLE TO GIVE INFECTION PASSES THROUGH THE WHOLESOME ORDEAL OF THE ROYAL PRESENCE AND ISSUES FROM IT FREE FROM ALL TAINT
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
IF GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE IN THIS WAY THE WORTHY RECTORESS CONSOLED HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS SIGHED AND SAT OVER THE PEERAGE ALL NIGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FAMOUS PRESENTATION
SHE ADOPTED A DEMEANOUR SO GRAND SELF SATISFIED DELIBERATE AND IMPOSING THAT IT MADE EVEN LADY JANE LAUGH SHE WALKED INTO THE ROYAL APARTMENTS WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH WOULD HAVE BEFITTED AN EMPRESS
A HUNDRED YARDS OF MALINES LACE ROLLED ROUND THEM WORTH TWICE THE NUMBER OF GUINEAS BECKY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED THEM WITH MORE PLEASURE YOU MAY BE SURE THEY OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE CHINA BOWL
I COULDN'T COME BEFORE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING A PUDDING I KNOW YOU WERE I SAW YOU THROUGH THE AREA RAILINGS AS I DROVE UP REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ABOUT THE AIRS WHICH THAT WOMAN WAS GIVING HERSELF MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY AND HER YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY HAD A COPY OF THE MORNING POST FROM TOWN
AS THE LACED JACKETED BAND OF THE LIFE GUARDS ARE BLOWING TRIUMPHAL MARCHES SEATED ON THOSE PRANCING MUSIC STOOLS THEIR CREAM COLOURED CHARGERS WHO ARE BY NO MEANS LOVELY AND ENTICING OBJECTS
LOMBARD STREET RAWDON HEARD BECKY LAUGHING IN THE NIGHT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS ONLY HER DELIGHT AT GOING TO GAUNT HOUSE AND FACING THE LADIES THERE SHE SAID WHICH AMUSED HER SO BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE WAS OCCUPIED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER THOUGHTS
IN A MODEST DRESS WITH A VEIL ON WHIPPED OFF IN A HACKNEY COACH TO THE CITY AND BEING LANDED AT MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S BANK
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HAD SHE BEEN ONE SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY
ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN IN VANITY FAIR WHEN THAT REVERED AND AUGUST BEING WAS INVESTED BY THE UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM OF THE REFINED AND EDUCATED PORTION OF THIS EMPIRE WITH THE TITLE OF PREMIER GENTILHOMME
WITH BRILLIANCE AND PROFUSION BECKY BLUSHED A LITTLE AND LOOKED AT HIM HARD FOR A MOMENT PITT CRAWLEY BLUSHED A LITTLE TOO AND LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW THE FACT IS HE HAD GIVEN HER A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE BRILLIANTS A PRETTY DIAMOND CLASP
THESE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BECKY PAID A VISIT UPSTAIRS TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND VALUABLE LITTLE THINGS IN WHICH PRIVATE MUSEUM SHE PLACED THE ONE NOTE WHICH
UNTIL SHE HAS PUT ON A TRAIN AND FEATHERS AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO HER SOVEREIGN AT COURT FROM THAT AUGUST INTERVIEW THEY COME OUT STAMPED AS HONEST WOMEN THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN GIVES THEM A CERTIFICATE OF VIRTUE
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUPERB DIAMONDS FORSOOTH AND HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT BY YOUR COUSIN THE LADY JANE
THAT IN ALL LONDON THERE WAS NO MORE LOYAL HEART THAN BECKY'S AFTER THIS INTERVIEW THE NAME OF HER KING WAS ALWAYS ON HER LIPS AND HE WAS PROCLAIMED BY HER TO BE THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN SHE WENT TO COLNAGHI'S
LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY AND HAVING ENJOYED FOR SOME TIME THE DISCOMFITURE OF MY LORD WHO HATED POOR BRIGGS FOR INTERRUPTING
TO HER OWN LITTLE PERSON BRIGGS SAW HER TAKE THEM ASKED NO QUESTIONS TOLD NO STORIES BUT I BELIEVE QUITE SYMPATHISED WITH HER ON THIS MATTER AND SO WOULD MANY ANOTHER HONEST WOMAN AND THE DIAMONDS
SHE GAVE US EVERYTHING SHE SHALL NEVER LEAVE ME UNTIL WE ARE RUINED UTTERLY OURSELVES
SHE GENTLY SAID SHE WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN SMALL NOTES AND THE REMAINDER IN ONE NOTE AND PASSING THROUGH SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD STOPPED THERE AND BOUGHT THE HANDSOMEST BLACK SILK GOWN FOR BRIGGS WHICH MONEY COULD BUY AND WHICH
AND OTHER GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WERE BEHIND THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT HE SAT FLORID OF FACE PORTLY OF PERSON COVERED WITH ORDERS AND IN A RICH CURLING HEAD OF HAIR HOW WE SANG GOD SAVE HIM
HOW POOR MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE'S CARD AND LADY CRACKENBURY'S CARD WHICH OUR LITTLE FRIEND HAD BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET A FEW MONTHS BACK AND OF WHICH THE SILLY LITTLE CREATURE WAS RATHER PROUD ONCE LORD LORD I SAY
BUT I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS ORTHODOX SAID THE LITTLE LADY WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD AND MANY LADIES ROUND ABOUT WHISPERED AND TALKED AND MANY GENTLEMEN NODDED AND WHISPERED AS THEY SAW WHAT MARKED ATTENTION THE GREAT NOBLEMAN WAS PAYING TO THE LITTLE ADVENTURESS
ANOTHER GREAT AND EXCEEDING HONOUR WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THE VIRTUOUS BECKY LADY STEYNE'S CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO MISTER RAWDON CRAWLEY'S DOOR AND THE FOOTMAN INSTEAD OF DRIVING DOWN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS BY HIS TREMENDOUS KNOCKING HE APPEARED TO BE INCLINED TO DO
BECKY WOULD NOT CONSORT ANY LONGER WITH THESE DUBIOUS ONES AND CUT LADY CRACKENBURY WHEN THE LATTER NODDED TO HER FROM HER OPERA BOX AND GAVE MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE THE GO BY IN THE RING ONE MUST MY DEAR SHOW ONE IS SOMEBODY SHE SAID
DESCENDED AND WENT INTO CURZON STREET HIS SWORD BETWEEN HIS LEGS LITTLE RAWDON STOOD WITH HIS FACE AGAINST THE PARLOUR WINDOW PANES SMILING AND NODDING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO HIS AUNT IN THE CARRIAGE WITHIN
WORSE THAN THAT SAID BECKY STILL CASTING DOWN HER EYES I HAVE RUINED HER RUINED HER
ASKED MEN DO THAT BECKY ANSWERED BITTERLY WOMEN ARE NOT SO BAD AS YOU
WHY YOU SILLY MAN SHE CONTINUED WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I GOT THEM ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE CLASP WHICH A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME LONG AGO I HIRED THEM TO BE SURE I HIRED THEM AT MISTER POLONIUS'S IN COVENTRY STREET
AFTER A PAUSE AND IN A VERY SAD VOICE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE AND SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
BUT THE FINEST SPORT OF ALL AFTER HER PRESENTATION WAS TO HEAR HER TALK VIRTUOUSLY
AND TO DECLARE THAT IF DEAR GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ADMITTED SUCH AN EXTREMELY ILL REGULATED PERSONAGE
HOW THE HOUSE ROCKED AND SHOUTED WITH THAT MAGNIFICENT MUSIC HOW THEY CHEERED AND CRIED AND WAVED HANDKERCHIEFS LADIES WEPT
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN REBECCA CRAWLEY
IF YOU HAD BEEN SANDY HAIRED GREEN EYED AND A FRENCH ROPE DANCER'S DAUGHTER MISSUS BUTE SAID TO HER ELDEST GIRL WHO ON THE CONTRARY WAS A VERY SWARTHY SHORT AND SNUB NOSED YOUNG LADY
WERE DESTINED TO MEET WITH AN EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD A REWARD WHICH THOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT UNSUBSTANTIAL THE LITTLE WOMAN COVETED WITH GREATER EAGERNESS THAN MORE POSITIVE BENEFITS
SHE AMUSED AND SOMEWHAT PESTERED HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER PERPETUAL TALK ABOUT HIS URBANITY AND BEAUTY WHO KNOWS PERHAPS THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT SHE MIGHT PLAY THE PART OF A MAINTENON OR A POMPADOUR
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
AS ONE UNCHARITABLE TO HER KINSWOMAN AND YET IF LADY JANE HAD KNOWN ALL I THINK EVEN HER KINDLY TEMPER WOULD HAVE FAILED HER THE FACT IS WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING SIR PITT'S HOUSE IN ORDER
AND AS DUBIOUS GOODS OR LETTERS ARE PASSED THROUGH AN OVEN AT QUARANTINE SPRINKLED WITH
TREMBLING AND COAXING WITH SMILES THE HUSBAND BY YOUR SIDE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE NEW VELVET GOWN FROM THE OLD ONE OR THE NEW BRACELET FROM LAST YEAR'S OR HAS ANY NOTION THAT THE RAGGED LOOKING YELLOW LACE SCARF COST FORTY GUINEAS
OF HER PRESENTATION TO THE SOVEREIGN
THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
AND THAT MADAME BOBINOT IS WRITING DUNNING LETTERS EVERY WEEK FOR THE MONEY THUS RAWDON KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BRILLIANT DIAMOND EAR RINGS OR THE SUPERB BRILLIANT ORNAMENT WHICH DECORATED THE FAIR BOSOM OF HIS LADY BUT LORD STEYNE WHO WAS IN HIS PLACE AT COURT
HER COMPLEXION COULD BEAR ANY SUNSHINE AS YET AND HER DRESS THOUGH IF YOU WERE TO SEE IT NOW ANY PRESENT LADY OF VANITY FAIR WOULD PRONOUNCE IT TO BE THE MOST FOOLISH AND PREPOSTEROUS ATTIRE EVER WORN WAS AS HANDSOME IN HER EYES AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC
TO WAIT UPON HIS MAJESTY BECAUSE MY OWN CARRIAGE IS NOT FORTHCOMING IT APPEARS THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE ON THE LAST DRAWING ROOM DAY HENCE THE DEGRADATION WHICH THE COLONEL HAD ALMOST SUFFERED OF BEING OBLIGED TO ENTER THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOVEREIGN IN A HACK CAB
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN THERE YOU SILLY LITTLE FOOL YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY YOU WILL GET US A PLACE INTERPOSED BECKY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
OF HIS KINGDOM DO YOU REMEMBER
SHOULD DRIVE UP IN CLOSED LITTERS
ALONG WITH ALL PREVIOUS VANITIES BUT WE ARE WANDERING TOO MUCH MISSUS RAWDON'S DRESS WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE CHARMANTE ON THE EVENTFUL DAY OF HER PRESENTATION
WHERE THE DOOSE DID YOU GET THE DIAMONDS BECKY SAID HER HUSBAND ADMIRING SOME JEWELS
THE CARRIAGE ROLLED DOWN THE STREET UNTIL ITS CARGO WAS FINALLY DISCHARGED AT THE GATES OF THE PALACE WHERE THE SOVEREIGN WAS SITTING IN STATE THE DIAMONDS WHICH HAD CREATED RAWDON'S ADMIRATION
IN THEIR GREAT FAMILY CARRIAGE JUST NEWLY BUILT AND READY FOR THE BARONET'S ASSUMPTION OF THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF OF HIS COUNTY DROVE UP TO THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CURZON STREET TO THE EDIFICATION OF RAGGLES
IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAD A VIRTUOUS LIFE AT LEAST SHE DESIRED TO ENJOY A CHARACTER FOR VIRTUE AND WE KNOW THAT NO LADY IN THE GENTEEL WORLD
WE MAY BE SURE THAT BECKY AND BRIGGS LOOKED OUT THOSE AUGUST NAMES IN THE PEERAGE AND FOLLOWED THE NOBLE RACES UP THROUGH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FAMILY TREE MY LORD STEYNE
OF COUNTENANCE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEAVENS HOW MUCH MORE CAN OLD LADY CASTLEMOULDY
WHICH CONFINED A PEARL NECKLACE WHICH SHE WORE AND THE BARONET HAD OMITTED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO HIS LADY BECKY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND THEN AT SIR PITT WITH AN AIR OF SAUCY TRIUMPH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHALL I BETRAY YOU
SO ELATED WAS SHE IN SPIRIT AND SO STRONG A SENSE HAD SHE OF THE DIGNIFIED POSITION WHICH SHE HAD AT LAST ATTAINED IN LIFE EVEN OUR BECKY HAD HER WEAKNESSES AND AS ONE OFTEN SEES HOW MEN PRIDE THEMSELVES UPON EXCELLENCES
MISSUS RAWDON HAD FOUND THE LACE AND THE BROCADE IN OLD WARDROBES THE PROPERTY OF THE FORMER LADIES OF THE HOUSE AND HAD QUIETLY CARRIED THE GOODS HOME
TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
MY LADY TUFTO MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER LADIES WHO HAD COME INTO CONTACT WITH MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY TO CRY FIE AT THE IDEA OF THE ODIOUS LITTLE ADVENTURESS MAKING HER CURTSEY BEFORE THE SOVEREIGN
AT WHICH REBECCA HELD DOWN HER HEAD THE MORE AND CRIED BITTERLY I COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE I DARE NOT TELL MY HUSBAND HE WOULD KILL ME IF I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAVE DONE I HAVE KEPT IT A SECRET FROM EVERYBODY BUT YOU AND YOU FORCED IT FROM ME
WITH WHICH TIME HAS MARKED HER FACE NO DRAWING ROOMS SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED FOR NOVEMBER
A STOUT COUNTESS OF SIXTY DECOLLETEE PAINTED WRINKLED WITH ROUGE UP TO HER DROOPING EYELIDS AND DIAMONDS TWINKLING IN HER WIG IS A WHOLESOME AND EDIFYING BUT NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT
WHO WAS WATCHING FROM HIS GREENGROCER'S SHOP AND SAW FINE PLUMES WITHIN AND ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF FLOWERS IN THE BREASTS OF THE NEW LIVERY COATS OF THE FOOTMEN SIR PITT IN A GLITTERING UNIFORM
NOT IT MUST BE OWNED OF THE VERY HIGHEST REPUTATION IN VANITY FAIR
SOME LADIES WE MAY HAVE SEEN WE WHO WEAR STARS AND CORDONS AND ATTEND THE SAINT JAMES'S ASSEMBLIES OR WE WHO IN MUDDY BOOTS DAWDLE UP AND DOWN PALL MALL AND PEEP INTO THE COACHES AS THEY DRIVE UP WITH THE GREAT FOLKS IN THEIR FEATHERS SOME LADIES OF FASHION
I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
TO KNOW NOTHING OR LITTLE IS IN THE NATURE OF SOME HUSBANDS TO HIDE IN THE NATURE OF HOW MANY WOMEN OH LADIES HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SURREPTITIOUS MILLINERS BILLS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE GOWNS AND BRACELETS WHICH YOU DAREN'T SHOW OR WHICH YOU WEAR TREMBLING
COMING TO CALL A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTERWARDS AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM AND OBSERVING EVERYTHING AS WAS HIS WONT FOUND HIS LADIES CARDS ALREADY RANGED AS THE TRUMPS OF BECKY'S HAND AND GRINNED
WHEN THIS ANGEL WAS ADMITTED INTO THE PARADISE OF A COURT WHICH SHE COVETED
AND OTHER FEMALE GIMCRACKS ARRANGED AND SHE SEATED IN SOME ARTLESS AND AGREEABLE POSTURE READY TO RECEIVE HIM WHENEVER SHE WAS SURPRISED OF COURSE
UPON THE PART OF THE FRENCH HOWEVER CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OCCURRING WHICH RENDERED THEM ANXIOUS FOR A RELEASE FROM THEIR POSITION
THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
THEY ARE SATISFIED THAT IF WE DID JUMP DOWN HERE WE ARE DROWNED AND NOW WE MUST THINK ABOUT CLIMBING UP AYE THAT WILL REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING RALPH GRUMBLED FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE THEN WALTER SAID
WE SHALL EAT NOTHING TILL WE ARE WITHIN THE WALLS OF HENNEBON AND THAT WILL BE BY DAYLIGHT TOMORROW IF ALL GOES WELL DRAW YOUR BELT AN INCH OR TWO TIGHTER IT WILL HELP TO KEEP OUT THE WOLF
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
AND GROUPS OF MEN SAT ROUND THEM DRINKING AND SHOUTING MANY LAY ABOUT IN DRUNKEN SLEEP
NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT
IN A SHORT TIME THE FADING BRIGHTNESS OF THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT FAR OVERHEAD TOLD THEM THAT TWILIGHT HAD COMMENCED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY ATTACHED THE FIRST STRAND TO THE ROPE SOME THREE FEET ABOVE THE WATER NOW WALTER SAID
BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
MANY KNIGHTS WERE STRUCK THROUGH THE BARS OF THEIR VIZORS OR THE JOINTS OF THEIR MAIL THE HORSES THOUGH DEFENDED BY IRON TRAPPINGS
TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
BESIDES THE GATES OF THE TOWN WILL STAND OPEN LATE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGES ROUND WILL HAVE COME IN TO JOIN IN THE REVELS I AM READY TO TRY IT MASTER WALTER RALPH REPLIED FOR I ACHE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WHICH WILL LEAVE THREE OVER BUT WE HAD BETTER PLACE THEM A LITTLE OVER A YARD
CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
THEY FOUND THE WORK LESS ARDUOUS THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED THE ROPE WAS DRY AND THE STRANDS HELD TIGHTLY TO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES THEY CHANGED PLACES RESTING IN TURN FROM THE WORK BUT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FROM THE TIME THEY MADE THE FIRST LOOP WALTER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS
AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
THE COUNTESS BEGGED FOR A LITTLE FURTHER DELAY BUT IN VAIN AND WITHDREW TO THE TURRET WHERE SHE HAD FOR SO MANY WEARY WEEKS WATCHED THE HORIZON IN HOPES OF SEEING THE SAILS OF THE APPROACHING FLEET WALTER WAS AT THE TIME WITH SIR JOHN POWIS ON THE WALLS
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
AND SWIM TO THE SIDE WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE THEY MAY GIVE A FEW TURNS OF THE WINDLASS TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS HOLD OF THE ROPE BELOW BE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SPLASHING OR NOISE FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD ABOVE
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
SLAYING ALL WHOM THEY ENCOUNTERED ALL IS LOST SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED LET US FALL BACK TO THE CASTLE AND DIE FIGHTING THERE DESCENDING FROM THE WALL THE PARTY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE STREETS THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY IN THE TOWN
WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
EVERY HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND BARRED AND FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS THE BURGHERS HURLED DOWN STONES AND BRICKS UPON THE FUGITIVES WHILE PARTIES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM FIERCELY MANY THREW DOWN THEIR ARMS AND CRIED FOR QUARTER BUT WERE INSTANTLY SLAIN
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
KING EDWARD HOWEVER FELT THAT HIS POSITION WAS GROWING DESPERATE FOR STARVATION WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND ONLY BY A VICTORY OVER AN IMMENSELY SUPERIOR FORCE IN A STRONGLY ENTRENCHED POSITION COULD HE EXTRICATE HIMSELF
IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
AND THE CARDINAL BISHOP OF TUSCULUM ARRIVED FROM THE POPE AND STROVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND TO BRING ABOUT A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES POINTING OUT TO THEM
FOR WE MUST DIE HERE IF WE ARE NOT HAULED OUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY AND CLIMB THAT ROPE I MIGHT DO TWENTY FEET OR SO ON A PINCH BUT I COULD NO MORE GET UP TO THE TOP THERE THAN I COULD FLY WE
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
THE ARRIVAL OF THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE PROOF OF SKILL AND VIGOUR GIVEN BY THE ENGLISH LEADER TOGETHER WITH THE TERROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE ENGLISH ARROWS SHOOK THE RESOLUTION OF DON LOUIS AND HIS TROOPS
AND HENNEBON OF COURSE REMAINED IN THEIR POSSESSION
AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
COME WITH ME WALTER HE SAID WE MUST FAIN PERSUADE THE COUNTESS IF SHE SAYS NO WE ENGLISHMEN WILL DIE IN THE BREACH BUT THOUGH READY TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR SO BRAVE A LADY I OWN THAT IT IS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
IN THE DIRECTION OF HENNEBON THEIR CLOTHES SOON DRIED AND ELATED AT THEIR ESCAPE FROM DANGER THEY STRUGGLED ON BRISKLY WHEN MORNING BROKE THEY ENTERED A WOOD AND LAY THERE TILL EVENING
BEFORE THE FORCE OF THE FRENCH FORTY THOUSAND STRONG THE EARL OF NORFOLK HAD FALLEN BACK AND REJOINED THE KING BUT EVEN AFTER THIS JUNCTION THE FRENCH FORCES EXCEEDED THOSE OF EDWARD FOURFOLD THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS VANNES
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED MAYBE THE COUNTESS IS DISTRAUGHT WITH HER SORROWS WALTER DASHED UP TO THE TURRET AND LOOKING SEAWARD BEHELD RISING OVER THE HORIZON A NUMBER OF MASTS HURRAH SIR JOHN HE SHOUTED WE ARE SAVED
I WILL GO FIRST AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME I MUST PUT ONE LEG THROUGH THE LOOP AND SIT AS IT WERE WHILE I FASTEN THE ONE ABOVE AS I SHALL WANT BOTH HANDS FOR THE WORK YOU WILL FIND IT A GOOD DEAL EASIER TO STAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE LOOP
THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
CHAPTER TEN A PLACE OF REFUGE THE FRENCH EXCITED TO THE UTMOST BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR COMMANDERS AND BY THEIR DESIRE TO WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE
AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL MASTER WALTER BUT I AM WELL NIGH FAMISHED IT IS THIRTY SIX HOURS SINCE I SWALLOWED A BIT OF FOOD
THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
THEY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A STRONG BODY OF MEN AT ARMS AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE OPENED A NUMBER OF ARCHERS ISSUED OUT AND TAKING THEIR PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE MOAT POURED A RAIN OF ARROWS UPON THE MEN WORKING THE MACHINE AND THOSE GUARDING IT MOST OF THESE
THE TIME NOW FOR A WHILE PASSED VERY QUIETLY WALTER AND THE OTHER YOUNG SQUIRES PRACTISED DILIGENTLY UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SIR WALTER AT KNIGHTLY EXERCISES WALTER LEARNED TO BEAR HIMSELF WELL ON HORSEBACK AND TO TILT IN THE RING
WHO SEEING THAT SUCH POWERFUL AID HAD ARRIVED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD WERE EASILY PERSUADED TO CHANGE SIDES AMONG THEM WERE THE LORDS OF CLISSON
WHILE THE ENGLISH ARMY LAY ON A HILL THE FRENCH CAMP WAS PITCHED ON LOW GROUND AN UNUSUALLY WET SEASON HAD SET IN WITH BITTERLY COLD WIND THE RAIN WAS INCESSANT A PESTILENCE HAD DESTROYED A VAST NUMBER OF THEIR HORSES
THAN DROP DOWN INTO THE DEEP HOLE OF THAT WELL AND YOUR BRAINS SERVED YOU SHREWDLY IN DEVISING A METHOD OF ESCAPE WHAT SAY YOU GENTLEMEN ALL PRESENT JOINED IN EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE AT THE LAD'S COOLNESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND
AND THE GATES WERE SHUT INSTANTLY BEHIND THEM WALTER AND HIS COMRADE AT ONCE STARTED AT A BRISK PACE
AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
WITH GREAT EFFORTS THEY MANAGED TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR ARMOUR AND THEN HELD ON WITH EASE TO THE ROPE THEY HAULED THE BUCKET TO THE SURFACE AND TIED A KNOT IN THE SLACK OF THE ROPE SO THAT THE BUCKET HUNG FOUR FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
JUST AS THE FRENCH WERE MOVING TO THE ATTACK HARD BLOWS I DON'T MIND I HAVE BEEN USED TO IT BUT WHAT WITH FIGHTING AND BEING IN THE WATER FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND CLIMBING UP THAT ENDLESS ROPE
WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
THAT SOME FOOD BE PLACED BEFORE US OR WE SHALL HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE FRENCH ONLY TO DIE OF HUNGER HERE WE HAVE TASTED NOUGHT SINCE THE ATTACK ON VANNES BEGAN HAVE ANY BESIDE US ESCAPED
THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT
SAVE OUR OWN LITTLE BAND NOT ONE IN THE TOWN WILL LIFT A SWORD AGAIN SUCH RESISTANCE AS WE CAN OFFER WILL BUT INFLAME THEM TO FURY AND ALL THE HORRORS OF A SACK WILL BE INFLICTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THERE SHE IS POOR LADY ON THE TURRET
TO GIVE NEWS OF THE ALTERED SITUATION DON LOUIS AT ONCE ORDERED AN ATTACK TO BE MADE WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE IN HOPES OF CAPTURING THE PLACE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH SUCCOUR BUT ANIMATED BY THEIR NEW HOPES THOSE SO LATELY DESPONDENT AND READY TO YIELD
AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
AND I CANNOT KEEP OPENING AND CLOSING THE GATE
AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN A LEADING PART IN THE INTRIGUE THESE LEAVING THE CITY BY A GATE AT WHICH THEY HAD PLACED SOME OF THEIR OWN FACTION TO OPEN IT TO THE FRENCH ISSUED OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ASSAILANTS CAMP
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CUT OFF THE SLACK OF THE ROPE THERE ARE SOME TWELVE FEET OF IT THEN WE WILL UNWIND THE STRANDS OF THAT THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX LARGE STRANDS AS FAR AS I CAN FEEL WE WILL CUT THEM UP INTO LENGTHS OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET
AND THE REST OF THE PROVINCE IN THE VICINITY OF VANNES AND THEN LAID SIEGE TO THAT TOWN AS HIS FORCE WAS FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE SIEGE THE EARLS OF NORFOLK AND WARWICK WERE DESPATCHED IN THE DIRECTION OF NANTES
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE THEY ARE SURE TO FIND US HERE AND IF THEY DON'T WE SHALL DIE OF COLD BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING I DON'T THINK THEY WILL FIND US WALTER SAID CHEERFULLY
WHEN THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE CASTLE THOROUGHLY IT MAY OCCUR TO SOME OF THEM THAT WE HAVE JUMPED DOWN THE WELL BUT IT WILL BE NO PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF ANYONE TO LOOK FOR US AND THEY WILL ALL BE TOO ANXIOUS
CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
YOU ARE DOING WELL YOUNG SIR THE ENGLISH LEADER WENT ON AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ON EACH OCCASION ON WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED I SHALL BE PROUD
IF I GET TIRED I WILL FASTEN ANOTHER LOOP BY THE SIDE OF THAT ON WHICH I AM RESTING SO YOU CAN COME UP AND PASS ME THERE IS NO HURRY IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE UP ABOVE AN HOUR
WHO COMMANDED THE GARRISON OF VANNES SUPPORTED THE SIEGE WITH GREAT COURAGE AND FORTITUDE KNOWING THAT CHARLES OF BLOIS AND THE KING OF FRANCE WERE COLLECTING A GREAT ARMY FOR HIS RELIEF UNITING THEIR FORCES THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TOWN
AND BY DINT OF UNBUCKLING THE CLOAKS AND ROLLING THEIR WEARERS GENTLY OVER WALTER SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN OBTAINING TWO OF THEM HE ALSO PICKED UP A SWORD FOR RALPH HIS OWN STILL HUNG IN ITS SHEATH AND THEN HE JOINED HIS COMPANION
WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE WHEN OUR WEIGHT ONCE GETS ON IT MIGHT BE NOTICED BY ANYONE CROSSING THE COURTYARD DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BITS OF ROPE RALPH ASKED JUST ENOUGH I THINK WALTER REPLIED
AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
BUT HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPULSED WITH VERY HEAVY LOSS THEY NOW SENT TO RENNES FOR TWELVE OF THE IMMENSE MACHINES USED IN BATTERING WALLS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THERE ON A FALSE REPORT OF THE WEAKNESS OF HENNEBON
AND WALKING ALL NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT DOES NOT SUIT ME AT ALL I FEEL RAVENOUS TOO RALPH
AND TO BE PROLONGED FROM THAT DAY FOR THE FULL TERM OF THREE YEARS IT WAS AGREED THAT THE TRUCE SHOULD EMBRACE NOT ONLY THE SOVEREIGNS BUT ALL THE ADHERENTS OF EACH OF THEM THE TRUCE WAS TO HOLD GOOD IN BRITTANY BETWEEN ALL PARTIES
HAVE MADE THEIR WAY HERE IN A FEW MINUTES A COLD CAPON SEVERAL MANCHETS OF BREAD AND A STOOP OF WINE WERE PLACED BEFORE WALTER WHILE RALPH'S WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO BELOW
ADVANCED WITH ARDOUR TO THE ASSAULT AND OFFICERS AND MEN VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE VALOUR WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN VAIN DID THE GARRISON SHOWER ARROWS AND CROSS BOW BOLTS AMONG THEM AND POUR DOWN BURNING OIL AND QUICKLIME UPON THEM
TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEIR FORCES THEY HAD PLACED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEIR BEST TROOPS ON THE WALLS GIVING THEM A HANDSOME LARGESS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS OF THE FESTIVITIES
BRINGING WITH THEM ROBERT OF ARTOIS WHO IS GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
WHO WERE NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS TALES OF THE WARS
THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE THE SOONER THE BETTER SAY I IN ANOTHER MINUTE BOTH STOOD IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS A RETIRED SPOT AND NONE WERE PASSING GOING ALONG THE PASSAGE THEY ISSUED INTO THE MAIN YARD HERE GREAT FIRES WERE BLAZING
AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
SIR JOHN POWIS AND HIS PARTY REPULSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSAILANTS AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL ENTRUSTED TO THEM BUT AT OTHER POINTS THE FRENCH GAINED A FOOTING AND SWARMING UP RUSHED ALONG THE WALLS
THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY DRAG THEIR LEGS ALONG UPON ENTERING THE TOWN WALTER MADE HIS WAY AT ONCE TO THE QUARTERS OF THE LEADER SIR WALTER HAD JUST RISEN AND WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SIGHT OF HIS ESQUIRE
THEY ALONE REMAINED STEADFAST WHEN ALL OTHERS FELL AWAY AND IT IS DUE TO THEM THAT I AM STILL ABLE AS MISTRESS OF THIS TOWN TO GREET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL NEXT TO SIR JOHN HIMSELF
THE SCANDAL AND DESOLATION WHICH THEIR RIVALRY CAUSED IN CHRISTENDOM THE WASTE OF NOBLE LIVES THE DEVASTATION OF ONCE HAPPY PROVINCES AND THE EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD GOING FROM CAMP TO CAMP THEY EXHORTED
I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR LOST WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE DOWN IN THE GALE THE NIGHT YOU STARTED WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FLEET SIR WALTER BUT THE MASTER HELD ON AND WE ARRIVED HERE FOUR DAYS AFTER WE PUT OUT WE TOOK PART IN THE SIEGE OF RENNES
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
YES HE WAS QUITE AWAKE WITH ONE SPRING HE WAS ON THE FLOOR HE CREPT GENTLY BEHIND THE CURTAIN BUT THE MAIDEN WAS GONE THE FLOWERS SHONE NO LONGER BUT THERE THEY STOOD FRESH AND BLOOMING AS EVER
FOR I TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART BUT I DON'T SAID THE SHADOW I BECOME FAT AND IT IS THAT ONE WANTS TO BECOME YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD YOU WILL BECOME ILL BY IT YOU MUST TRAVEL
I AM IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE CAME A SORT OF DESIRE OVER ME TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU DIE YOU WILL DIE I SUPPOSE I ALSO WISHED TO SEE THIS LAND AGAIN
AND THE SHADOW ALSO TURNED ROUND YES IF ANYONE HAD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN QUITE DISTINCTLY THAT THE SHADOW WENT IN THROUGH THE HALF OPEN BALCONY DOOR OF THEIR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR
AND THE CANNONS WENT OFF WITH A BUM BUM AND THE SOLDIERS PRESENTED ARMS THAT WAS A MARRIAGE THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY TO SHOW THEMSELVES AND GET ANOTHER HURRAH
HAD I WRITTEN A NEWSPAPER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN READ
I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I WILL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES AND YOU WRITE THE DESCRIPTIONS AND IF THEY ARE A LITTLE AMUSING FOR ME ON THE WAY I WILL GO TO A WATERING PLACE
AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
AND ALL SENSIBLE FOLKS WERE OBLIGED TO STAY WITHIN DOORS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS AND DOORS WERE CLOSED THE WHOLE DAY IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE HOUSE SLEPT OR THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME
BECOME VERY WELL OFF SHALL I PURCHASE MY FREEDOM FROM SERVICE IF SO I CAN DO IT AND THEN HE RATTLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF VALUABLE SEALS THAT HUNG TO HIS WATCH AND HE STUCK HIS HAND
THEY BELONG TO MY CHILDHOOD'S LEARNING SAID THE SHADOW I REALLY BELIEVE MY SHADOW BY THE DOOR THERE CAN ANSWER THEM YOUR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS THAT WOULD INDEED BE MARVELLOUS
HE HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO GET HIS BEARD TO GROW THEY SAY BUT I SEE THE REAL CAUSE HE CANNOT CAST A SHADOW SHE HAD BECOME INQUISITIVE
I WILL THEREFORE DO SOMETHING PARTICULAR FOR THEE THOU SHALT ALWAYS LIVE WITH ME IN THE PALACE DRIVE WITH ME IN MY ROYAL CARRIAGE AND HAVE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR BUT THEN
BOTH THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW BUT NO ONE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED IN HER OWN KINGDOM NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND HE HAD HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
BUT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT HE IS SO PROUD OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF FOR A MAN THAT WHEN HE IS TO BE IN A PROPER HUMOR AND HE MUST BE SO TO ANSWER WELL HE MUST BE TREATED QUITE LIKE A MAN
I BECAME A MAN I CAME OUT MATURED BUT YOU WERE NO LONGER IN THE WARM LANDS AS A MAN I WAS ASHAMED TO GO AS I DID I WAS IN WANT OF BOOTS OF CLOTHES
ONLY IMAGINE YES IT IS TRUE SUCH A POOR SHADOW SKULL CANNOT BEAR MUCH ONLY THINK MY SHADOW HAS BECOME MAD HE THINKS THAT HE IS A MAN AND THAT I
BUT NO ONE CAME IN SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM SUCH AN EXTREMELY LEAN MAN THAT HE FELT QUITE STRANGE AS TO THE REST THE MAN WAS VERY FINELY DRESSED HE MUST BE A GENTLEMAN
WELL THEN GO BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
THIS IS IN FACT A BASE WORLD I WOULD NOT BE A MAN IF IT WERE NOT NOW ONCE ACCEPTED AND REGARDED AS SOMETHING TO BE SO I SAW THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE THINGS WITH THE WOMEN WITH THE MEN
FOR IT NOW BEGINS TO BE AMUSING HERE I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THAT STRANGER WOULD THAT HIS BEARD SHOULD NOT GROW FOR IN THAT CASE HE WILL LEAVE US IN THE EVENING THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW DANCED TOGETHER
THAT I HAVE BEEN YOUR SHADOW I INTEND TO GET BETROTHED FOR I CAN PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN ONE FAMILY BE QUITE AT THY EASE ABOUT THAT SAID THE LEARNED MAN I SHALL NOT SAY TO ANYONE WHO THOU ACTUALLY ART
BUT THE ONE DOOR STOOD OPEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OTHER THROUGH A LONG ROW OF ROOMS AND SALOONS AND THERE IT WAS LIGHTED UP I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY KILLED IF I HAD GONE OVER TO THE MAIDEN BUT I WAS CIRCUMSPECT I TOOK TIME TO THINK
THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
THE SHADOW ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO KEEP ITSELF IN THE MASTER'S PLACE NOW THE LEARNED MAN DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THAT HE WAS A VERY KIND HEARTED MAN AND PARTICULARLY MILD AND FRIENDLY AND SO HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE SHADOW
IT IS CERTAINLY HARD SAID THE SHADOW FOR HE WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT AND THEN HE GAVE A SORT OF SIGH YOU ARE A NOBLE CHARACTER SAID THE PRINCESS THE WHOLE CITY WAS ILLUMINATED IN THE EVENING
AND THEN THEN I WAS IN THE ANTECHAMBER SAID THE SHADOW YOU ALWAYS SAT AND LOOKED OVER TO THE ANTECHAMBER THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE WAS A SORT OF TWILIGHT
AND THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND KEPT ITSELF SO STILL AND QUIET THAT IT MIGHT HEAR ALL THAT PASSED IT WISHED TO KNOW HOW IT COULD GET FREE AND WORK ITS WAY UP SO AS TO BECOME ITS OWN MASTER
FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH
AND THAT THE SHADOW COULD REMARK FOR SHE ALMOST PIERCED HIM THROUGH WITH HER EYES SO THEY DANCED ONCE MORE TOGETHER AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO DECLARE HERSELF BUT SHE WAS DISCREET SHE THOUGHT OF HER COUNTRY AND KINGDOM
IN THE THICK GOLD CHAIN HE WORE AROUND HIS NECK NAY HOW ALL HIS FINGERS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND RINGS AND THEN ALL WERE PURE GEMS NAY I CANNOT RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE SAID THE LEARNED MAN
IT IS SAID IN A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WELL MEANT MANNER YOU AS A LEARNED MAN CERTAINLY KNOW HOW STRANGE NATURE IS SOME PERSONS CANNOT BEAR TO TOUCH GREY PAPER OR THEY BECOME ILL
HERE IS MY CARD I LIVE ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET AND AM ALWAYS AT HOME IN RAINY WEATHER AND SO AWAY WENT THE SHADOW THAT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SAID THE LEARNED MAN
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL SHADOW DO YOU NOT SEE THAT PERSON WHO ALWAYS GOES WITH ME OTHER PERSONS HAVE A COMMON SHADOW BUT I DO NOT LIKE WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL
NOW THEY WERE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PRINCESS REIGNED WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME LISTEN MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE SHADOW TO THE LEARNED MAN I HAVE NOW BECOME AS HAPPY AND MIGHTY AS ANYONE CAN BE
THOU MUST SUBMIT TO BE CALLED SHADOW BY ALL AND EVERYONE THOU MUST NOT SAY THAT THOU HAST EVER BEEN A MAN AND ONCE A YEAR WHEN I SIT ON THE BALCONY IN THE SUNSHINE
SAID THE SHADOW AND THEN HE SAT WITH THE POLISHED BOOTS AS HEAVILY AS HE COULD ON THE ARM OF THE LEARNED MAN'S NEW SHADOW WHICH LAY LIKE A POODLE DOG AT HIS FEET NOW THIS WAS PERHAPS FROM ARROGANCE
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE A SHADOW SAID HIS FRIENDS TO HIM AND THE LEARNED MAN TREMBLED FOR HE THOUGHT OF IT YOU MUST GO TO A WATERING PLACE SAID THE SHADOW WHO CAME AND VISITED HIM THERE IS NOTHING ELSE FOR IT
THAT IT WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT THE LEARNED MAN THEN CAME HOME AND HE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT WHAT WAS TRUE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUT WHAT WAS GOOD AND WHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THERE PASSED DAYS AND YEARS
THIS IS RATHER TOO BAD THOUGHT HE THAT I MUST SAY YOU AND HE SAY THOU BUT HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH IT SO THEY CAME TO A WATERING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MANY STRANGERS
AND AS TO THE MUSIC IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE EXTREMELY TIRESOME IT IS AS IF SOME ONE SAT THERE AND PRACTISED A PIECE THAT HE COULD NOT MASTER
IT WAS REALLY QUITE ASTONISHING HOW MUCH OF A MAN IT WAS IT WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK AND OF THE VERY FINEST CLOTH IT HAD PATENT LEATHER BOOTS AND A HAT THAT COULD BE FOLDED TOGETHER
BUT NOW IT WAS ONLY TO THE HOT LANDS THAT A LEARNED MAN HAD COME FROM THE COLD THERE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD RUN ABOUT JUST AS WHEN AT HOME BUT HE SOON FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE HE
THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
AND OF THE MANY PERSONS SHE WOULD HAVE TO REIGN OVER HE IS A WISE MAN
IN THE COURSE OF THREE WEEKS HE HAD A VERY FAIR SHADOW WHICH WHEN HE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN THE NORTHERN LANDS GREW MORE AND MORE IN THE JOURNEY SO THAT AT LAST IT WAS SO LONG AND SO LARGE
I WILL NOT SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT HE CAN SAID THE SHADOW BUT I THINK SO HE HAS NOW FOLLOWED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS AND LISTENED TO MY CONVERSATION I SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE
FOR HE FOUND EVERYTHING MARVELLOUS OUT THERE IN THE WARM LANDS IF THERE HAD ONLY BEEN NO SUN THE STRANGER'S LANDLORD SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE SAW NO PERSON ABOUT
THE WOMAN DIDN'T THINK HOW MUCH SHE CONCEALED I WENT OUT FIRST IN THE EVENING I RAN ABOUT THE STREETS IN THE MOONLIGHT I MADE MYSELF LONG UP THE WALLS IT TICKLES THE BACK SO DELIGHTFULLY
OH I LIKE THAT SAID THE PRINCESS SO SHE WENT TO THE LEARNED MAN BY THE DOOR AND SHE SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ABOUT PERSONS OUT OF AND IN THE WORLD AND HE ANSWERED WITH WISDOM AND PRUDENCE
YES YOU SEE I HAVE EVEN GIVEN HIM A SHADOW IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF WHAT THOUGHT THE PRINCESS SHOULD I REALLY BE CURED THESE BATHS ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD
BUT YOU YOURSELF DO NOT BELONG TO THE COMMON ORDER AND I AS YOU KNOW WELL HAVE FROM A CHILD FOLLOWED IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS AS SOON AS YOU FOUND I WAS CAPABLE TO GO OUT ALONE IN THE WORLD I WENT MY OWN WAY
THE MASTER OF THE MINT STRUCK NEW COIN FOR ME AND THE WOMEN SAID I WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO I BECAME THE MAN I AM
BUT NOW YOU MUST TELL ME ALL YOU SAW EVERYTHING SAID THE SHADOW FOR I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING HOW DID IT LOOK IN THE FURTHEST SALOON ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
I DID NOT GO QUITE IN I REMAINED IN THE FOREMOST ROOM IN THE TWILIGHT BUT I STOOD THERE QUITE WELL I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN IN THE ANTECHAMBER AT THE COURT OF POESY
NAY IS IT REALLY THOU SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS MOST REMARKABLE I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE'S OLD SHADOW COULD COME AGAIN AS A MAN TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO PAY SAID THE SHADOW
THE STREET BOYS WERE SCREAMING AND HOOTING AND SHOUTING AND SHOOTING WITH DEVILS AND DETONATING BALLS AND THERE CAME CORPSE BEARERS AND HOOD WEARERS FOR THERE WERE FUNERALS WITH PSALM AND HYMN AND THEN
WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN I BECAME SO STRANGELY GREAT IN THE MOONLIGHT I WAS VERY NEAR BEING MORE DISTINCT THAN YOURSELF AT THAT TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY NATURE
BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT AT HOME HE HAD PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOW ABOVE AND BELOW HE HAD SEEN BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER AND SO HE COULD ANSWER THE PRINCESS AND MAKE INSINUATIONS
YOU SEE THAT IT IS A FEELING THAT IT IS NOT PRIDE I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SAY THOU TO ME BUT I WILL WILLINGLY SAY THOU TO YOU SO IT IS HALF DONE SO THE SHADOW SAID THOU TO ITS FORMER MASTER
AS WE HAVE NOW BECOME COMPANIONS AND IN THIS WAY HAVE GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD SHALL WE NOT DRINK THOU TOGETHER IT IS MORE FAMILIAR YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE SHADOW WHO WAS NOW THE PROPER MASTER
MY BEARD DOES NOT GROW OUT AS IT OUGHT THAT IS ALSO A SICKNESS AND ONE MUST HAVE A BEARD NOW YOU BE WISE AND ACCEPT THE OFFER WE SHALL TRAVEL AS COMRADES AND SO THEY TRAVELLED
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE IT WAS VEXATIOUS BUT IN THE WARM LANDS EVERYTHING GROWS SO QUICKLY AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT DAYS HE OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT A NEW SHADOW CAME IN THE SUNSHINE
ONLY IN THAT SINGLE HOUSE WHICH STOOD OPPOSITE THAT IN WHICH THE LEARNED FOREIGNER LIVED IT WAS QUITE STILL AND YET SOME ONE LIVED THERE FOR THERE STOOD FLOWERS IN THE BALCONY
FOR HE KNEW THAT THE SHADOW WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ITS MASTER FOR A SCREEN BUT HE COULD NOT ENTICE IT HE MADE HIMSELF LITTLE HE MADE HIMSELF GREAT BUT NO SHADOW CAME AGAIN HE SAID HEM HEM
AND CANDLES BURNT YES ABOVE A THOUSAND LIGHTS WERE BURNING AND THE ONE TALKED AND THE OTHER SUNG AND PEOPLE WALKED AND CHURCH BELLS RANG AND ASSES WENT ALONG WITH A DINGLE DINGLE DONG FOR THEY TOO HAD BELLS ON
FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOVE OUR NATIVE LAND I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER SHADOW AGAIN HAVE I ANYTHING TO PAY TO IT OR YOU IF SO YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SAYING WHAT IT IS
AND THOU WILT GO TO PRISON AND THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO FOR THE SENTINELS OBEYED HIM WHOM THEY KNEW THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS TO MARRY YOU TREMBLE SAID THE PRINCESS AS THE SHADOW CAME INTO HER CHAMBER
I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR OF THY GOOD FORTUNE SIT DOWN OLD FRIEND AND TELL ME A LITTLE HOW IT HAS GONE WITH THEE AND WHAT THOU HAST SEEN AT OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S THERE IN THE WARM LANDS
THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND FAR WITHIN THE MUSIC SOUNDED SO SOFT AND DELIGHTFUL ONE COULD REALLY MELT AWAY IN SWEET THOUGHTS FROM IT YET IT WAS LIKE A PIECE OF ENCHANTMENT
ASKED THE LEARNED MAN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE FINE MAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ME I HAVE GOT SO MUCH BODY I HAVE EVEN GOT FLESH AND CLOTHES
AND SO SHE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION DIRECTLY WITH THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN ON THEIR PROMENADES AS THE DAUGHTER OF A KING SHE NEEDED NOT TO STAND UPON TRIFLES SO SHE SAID YOUR COMPLAINT IS
WAS IT THERE AS IN THE FRESH WOODS WAS IT THERE AS IN A HOLY CHURCH WERE THE SALOONS LIKE THE STARLIT FIRMAMENT WHEN WE STAND ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS EVERYTHING WAS THERE SAID THE SHADOW
YOU CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING ME SO WELL OFF DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR OLD SHADOW YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER MORE RETURN THINGS HAVE GONE ON WELL WITH ME SINCE I WAS LAST WITH YOU I HAVE IN ALL RESPECTS
IN OUR TIME WATER HAS WONDERFUL POWERS
NOW ONLY THINK THAT I AM HIS SHADOW IT IS TERRIBLE SAID THE PRINCESS BUT HE IS CONFINED IS HE NOT THAT HE IS I AM AFRAID THAT HE WILL NEVER RECOVER POOR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS
OF THE WHOLE HUMAN VARNISH THAT MAKES A MAN PERCEPTIBLE I TOOK MY WAY I TELL IT TO YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT PUT IT IN ANY BOOK I TOOK MY WAY TO THE CAKE WOMAN I HID MYSELF BEHIND HER
COME NOW BE USEFUL AND DO ME A SERVICE SAID HE IN JEST HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN NOW ART THOU GOING AND THEN HE NODDED TO THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW NODDED AGAIN
THE SHADOW IT IS IN THE HOT LANDS THAT THE SUN BURNS SURE ENOUGH THERE THE PEOPLE BECOME QUITE A MAHOGANY BROWN AY AND IN THE HOTTEST LANDS THEY ARE BURNT TO NEGROES
BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WITHOUT A SHADOW IT WAS KNOWN TO EVERYBODY AT HOME IN THE COLD LANDS AND IF THE LEARNED MAN NOW CAME THERE AND TOLD HIS STORY
AND HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE LUSTRE CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALL THE FLOWERS SHONE LIKE FLAMES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOWERS STOOD A SLENDER GRACEFUL MAIDEN
POESY CRIED THE LEARNED MAN YES YES SHE OFTEN DWELLS A RECLUSE IN LARGE CITIES POESY YES I HAVE SEEN HER
JUST AS THE STRANGER WENT INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND LET THE LONG CURTAIN FALL DOWN AFTER HIM NEXT MORNING THE LEARNED MAN WENT OUT TO DRINK COFFEE AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT
AND THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS DO AND WHAT DIDST THOU THEN SEE ASKED THE LEARNED MAN I SAW EVERYTHING AND I SHALL TELL ALL TO YOU BUT IT IS NO PRIDE ON MY PART AS A FREE MAN AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
THOU ART ONLY DRESSED UP THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL BELIEVE IT SAID THE SHADOW BE REASONABLE OR I WILL CALL THE GUARD I WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE PRINCESS SAID THE LEARNED MAN BUT I WILL GO FIRST SAID THE SHADOW
SO THAT IT WAS BARE CROWN AND BRIM NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IT HAD SEALS GOLD NECK CHAIN AND DIAMOND RINGS YES THE SHADOW WAS WELL DRESSED AND IT WAS JUST THAT WHICH MADE IT QUITE A MAN
THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL YES THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
THAT YOU CANNOT CAST A SHADOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MUST BE IMPROVING CONSIDERABLY SAID THE SHADOW I KNOW YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU SEE TOO CLEARLY BUT IT HAS DECREASED YOU ARE CURED
WAS NOT AT ALL IN THE MOST ENVIABLE STATE GRIEF AND TORMENT FOLLOWED HIM AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MOST PERSONS LIKE ROSES FOR A COW HE WAS QUITE ILL AT LAST
I LEARNED TO KNOW MY INWARD NATURE MY INNATE QUALITIES THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH POESY AT THE TIME I WAS WITH YOU I THOUGHT NOT OF THAT BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT WELL
THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING
THE SHADOW WAS MASTER AND THE MASTER WAS THE SHADOW THEY DROVE WITH EACH OTHER THEY RODE AND WALKED TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE AND BEHIND JUST AS THE SUN WAS
IN THE LARGE BALL ROOM SHE WAS LIGHT BUT HE WAS STILL LIGHTER SHE HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PARTNER IN THE DANCE SHE TOLD HIM FROM WHAT LAND SHE CAME AND HE KNEW THAT LAND HE HAD BEEN THERE
IT WAS AS IF SHE ALSO SHONE THE LIGHT REALLY HURT HIS EYES
WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED
AND WHO LIVED THERE WHERE WAS THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE THE WHOLE OF THE GROUND FLOOR WAS A ROW OF SHOPS AND THERE PEOPLE COULD NOT ALWAYS BE RUNNING THROUGH ONE EVENING THE STRANGER SAT OUT ON THE BALCONY
IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET
SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED HE MUST BE THE WISEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHE FELT SUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE KNEW SO THAT WHEN THEY AGAIN DANCED TOGETHER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
I TELL YOU I WAS THERE AND YOU CAN CONCEIVE THAT I SAW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO BE SEEN HAD YOU COME OVER THERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MAN BUT I BECAME SO AND BESIDES
THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS I AM QUITE DESPERATE
ONE EVENING AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVED IN OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SAID THE SHADOW IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING OF ALL BEINGS IT WAS POESY I WAS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS
I HAVE NO SHADOW SO THEN IT HAS ACTUALLY GONE LAST NIGHT AND NOT COME AGAIN IT IS REALLY TIRESOME THIS ANNOYED HIM NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE SHADOW WAS GONE
A SINGLE SHORT MOMENT BUT SLEEP CAME INTO MY EYES SHE STOOD ON THE BALCONY AND SHONE AS THE AURORA BOREALIS SHINES GO ON GO ON THOU WERT ON THE BALCONY AND WENT THROUGH THE DOORWAY
WEEPING WEEPING JUST LIKE A BOY HEY MISTER DRIVER
POOR BEAST COME COME SAID THE LITTLE MAN
WHERE CAN YOU FIND A PLACE THAT WILL AGREE BETTER WITH YOU AND ME NO SCHOOLS NO TEACHERS NO BOOKS
INDEED I KNOW HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED ME AND HOW HE ENJOYED SPEAKING ILL OF ME BUT I AM OF

LAMP WICK AND ALL THE OTHER BOYS WHO HAD TRAVELED WITH THEM STARTED OUT ON A TOUR OF INVESTIGATION THEY WANDERED EVERYWHERE THEY LOOKED INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER HOUSE AND THEATER
HE JUMPED TO THE GROUND RAN UP TO THE DONKEY ON WHOSE BACK HE HAD BEEN RIDING
WAS TO BE BUTTERED ON BOTH SIDES THEY ALL ENDED BY ACCEPTING THE INVITATION WITH THE WORDS
DONKEY JUST LIKE THE ONES THAT PULL THE FRUIT CARTS TO MARKET OH WHAT HAVE I DONE
AND WITH ONE LEAP HE PERCHED HIMSELF THERE
NEVER MIND ANSWERED LAMP WICK IF THERE'S NO ROOM INSIDE
AGAIN THE BOYS SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER BUT THE LITTLE MAN INSTEAD OF LAUGHING BECAME SO LOVING TOWARD THE LITTLE ANIMAL THAT WITH ANOTHER KISS
THAT DAY HE WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE TO INVITE HIM TO THE PARTY BUT LAMP WICK WAS NOT AT HOME HE WENT A SECOND TIME AND AGAIN A THIRD
BOTH OF THEM AND YOURS BOTH OF THEM TOO I WONDER IF IT COULD BE THE SAME SICKNESS I'M AFRAID IT IS WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR LAMP WICK
IN A MOCKING WAY FINALLY

YOU OWE IT TO ME TO MY ADVICE TO MY CARE DO YOU ADMIT IT ONLY TRUE FRIENDS COUNT AFTER ALL IT'S TRUE LAMP WICK IT'S TRUE
AND REASONABLE PINOCCHIO MOUNTED AND THE WAGON STARTED ON ITS WAY WHILE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED ALONG THE STONY ROAD
BUT WHAT IS DONE CAN'T BE UNDONE INSTEAD OF MOANS AND CRIES THEY BURST FORTH INTO LOUD DONKEY BRAYS
MAY THAT BRING YOU LUCK PINOCCHIO LAMP WICK CALLED OUT
SHALL I SEE YOU AT MY PARTY TOMORROW BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT I GO
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BAG PINOCCHIO FELT SLIGHTLY HAPPIER AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY FRIEND MUST BE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME SICKNESS THAT I AM
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
THE WHOLE COMPANY OF RUNAWAYS LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY THE LITTLE FAT MAN DID NOT LAUGH HE WENT UP TO THE REBELLIOUS ANIMAL AND STILL SMILING BENT OVER HIM LOVINGLY AND
TO A REAL COUNTRY THE BEST IN THE WORLD A WONDERFUL PLACE
BLOWING OF TRUMPETS THAT IT WAS DEAFENING EVERYWHERE GROUPS OF BOYS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SOME PLAYED AT MARBLES AT HOPSCOTCH AT BALL OTHERS RODE ON BICYCLES OR ON WOODEN HORSES SOME PLAYED AT
VACATION BEGINS ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY AND ENDS ON THE LAST DAY OF DECEMBER
GOOD BY THEN AND REMEMBER ME TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
HE LOOKED FOR LAMP WICK EVERYWHERE ALONG THE STREETS IN THE SQUARES INSIDE THE THEATRES EVERYWHERE BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND HE ASKED EVERYONE
LET HIM WEEP
THEY ENDED BY BURSTING OUT INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER THEY LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU AND TO THINK THAT THE TEACHER WHEN SPEAKING OF YOU USED TO SAY DO NOT GO WITH THAT LAMP WICK
FROM AN EARACHE NEVER AND YOU NEVER STILL SINCE THIS MORNING MY EAR HAS BEEN TORTURING ME
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WILL YOU COME WITH US
IN THE LAND OF TOYS NOT EVEN THE SHADOW OF ONE NOT EVEN ONE TEACHER NOT ONE AND ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY
TILL NIGHT WITHOUT EVER SEEING A BOOK OR A DESK OR A SCHOOL BUT MY CHILDREN THERE CAME A MORNING WHEN PINOCCHIO AWOKE
LIKE A BOX OF SARDINES THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE YET NOT ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT WAS HEARD THE THOUGHT
THE FAIRY'S WORDS HAD THROWN HIM PINOCCHIO ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO GIVE OUT THE INVITATIONS
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN LAMP WICK STOPPED LAUGHING HE TOTTERED AND ALMOST FELL PALE AS A GHOST HE TURNED TO PINOCCHIO AND SAID
AND FOUND A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM A SURPRISE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL VERY UNHAPPY
A VERY QUIET VOICE WHISPERING TO HIM POOR SILLY YOU HAVE DONE AS YOU WISHED BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE A SORRY BOY
GLADLY WITH MY WHOLE HEART WILL YOU LET ME SEE YOUR EARS WHY NOT
THE BOYS SLEPT LAMP WICK SNORED LIKE A DORMOUSE
BUT TO BE ALLOWED TO RIDE
HOW WELL I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU A DAY WILL COME
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS STUDY HERE IT IS ONLY ON SATURDAYS THAT WE HAVE NO SCHOOL IN THE LAND OF TOYS EVERY DAY EXCEPT SUNDAY IS A SATURDAY
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
TO THAT LOVELY PLACE CALLED THE LAND OF TOYS IN FACT THE WAGON WAS SO CLOSELY PACKED WITH BOYS OF ALL AGES THAT IT LOOKED
INCHES YOU MUST KNOW
THAN DONE HE APPROACHED THE FIRST DONKEY AND TRIED TO MOUNT IT BUT THE LITTLE ANIMAL TURNED SUDDENLY AND GAVE HIM SUCH A TERRIBLE KICK IN THE STOMACH THAT PINOCCHIO WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND AND FELL WITH HIS LEGS IN THE AIR AT THIS UNLOOKED FOR ENTERTAINMENT
BOYS WHO STOP STUDYING AND TURN THEIR BACKS
LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO SEE WHENCE THE WORDS HAD COME BUT HE SAW NO ONE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED
IN THE MEANTIME PINOCCHIO LIFTED HIMSELF UP FROM THE GROUND AND WITH ONE LEAP LANDED ON THE DONKEY'S BACK THE LEAP WAS SO WELL TAKEN THAT ALL THE BOYS SHOUTED HURRAH FOR PINOCCHIO
THE LONGER AND THE MORE HAIRY GREW HIS EARS
THE SQUARES WERE FILLED WITH SMALL WOODEN THEATERS OVERFLOWING WITH BOYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND ON THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
BUT WHAT FEVER IS IT THE DONKEY FEVER
THE SEATS ARE ALL FILLED ANSWERED THE LITTLE MAN BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I THINK OF YOU TAKE MY PLACE AS COACHMAN AND YOU
BECOME LIKE THOSE OF A DONKEY IN A LITTLE WHILE HE CHANGES INTO A REAL DONKEY AND BEGINS TO BRAY EVERYONE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
IS COMPOSED OF SIX SATURDAYS AND ONE SUNDAY VERY SURE AND THAT
THAT IN A FEW HOURS THEY WOULD REACH A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS NO BOOKS NO TEACHERS MADE THESE BOYS SO HAPPY THAT THEY FELT NEITHER HUNGER NOR THIRST
I MUCH PREFER RIDING ONE OF THESE DONKEYS CRIED PINOCCHIO
IS SHE AFRAID THE BATS WILL EAT YOU UP LISTEN LAMP WICK
HAD ON THEIR FEET LACED SHOES MADE OF LEATHER JUST LIKE THE ONES BOYS WEAR AND THE DRIVER OF THE WAGON IMAGINE TO YOURSELVES A LITTLE FAT MAN
IN ORDER TO GIVE ALL THEIR TIME TO NONSENSE AND PLEASURE SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF
VERY VERY SURE
MUST SOONER OR LATER TURN INTO DONKEYS BUT IS IT REALLY SO
YOU CAN MOUNT NOW MY BOY HE THEN SAID TO PINOCCHIO HAVE NO FEAR THAT DONKEY WAS WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING BUT I HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM AND NOW HE SEEMS QUIET
AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS IN HEARTY APPLAUSE SUDDENLY THE LITTLE DONKEY GAVE A KICK WITH HIS TWO HIND FEET AND AT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE
THEY BECAME EVERYBODY'S FRIEND WHO COULD BE HAPPIER THAN THEY WHAT WITH ENTERTAINMENTS AND PARTIES THE HOURS THE DAYS THE WEEKS PASSED LIKE LIGHTNING OH
I WANTED TO RETURN HOME I WANTED TO BE OBEDIENT I WANTED TO STUDY AND TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL BUT LAMP WICK SAID TO ME
WE SHALL SEE IF YOU ARE TELLING THE TRUTH
NODDING HIS WOODEN HEAD AS IF TO SAY
IN A VOICE SWEET AS HONEY AND SOFT AS A FLUTE SAID TO HIS COMPANION TELL ME LAMP WICK DEAR FRIEND HAVE YOU EVER SUFFERED
AND STILL OTHERS A MIXTURE OF BROWN AND BLACK HERE AND THERE WERE A FEW WITH LARGE YELLOW AND BLUE STRIPES THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL WAS THAT
SAID PINOCCHIO BUT FROM NOW ON I OBEY
BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT WAS THE ONE IN WHICH THE TWO POOR CREATURES FELT THEIR TAILS APPEAR OVERCOME WITH SHAME AND GRIEF THEY TRIED TO CRY AND BEMOAN THEIR FATE
THEIR ARMS TURNED INTO LEGS THEIR FACES LENGTHENED INTO SNOUTS AND THEIR BACKS BECAME COVERED WITH LONG GRAY HAIRS THIS WAS HUMILIATION ENOUGH
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PLAY PINOCCHIO WAKES UP ONE FINE MORNING AND FINDS A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM FINALLY THE WAGON ARRIVED IT MADE NO NOISE
AT TAG HERE A GROUP
THE DORMOUSE TOOK PINOCCHIO'S WRIST BETWEEN HER PAWS AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES LOOKED UP AT HIM SORROWFULLY AND SAID MY FRIEND
AT THE WORD THREE THE TWO BOYS PULLED OFF THEIR CAPS
BUT THE FAULT IS NOT MINE BELIEVE ME LITTLE DORMOUSE
SANG SLEEPILY BETWEEN HIS TEETH AFTER A MILE OR SO PINOCCHIO AGAIN HEARD THE SAME FAINT VOICE WHISPERING REMEMBER LITTLE SIMPLETON
FONDLY EMBRACING HIS FRIEND FIVE MONTHS PASSED AND THE BOYS CONTINUED PLAYING

TURNING ONCE MORE TO HIS FRIEND
AND RECITED A FEW TURNED SOMERSAULTS OTHERS WALKED ON THEIR HANDS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR GENERALS IN FULL UNIFORM LEADING REGIMENTS OF CARDBOARD SOLDIERS PASSED BY LAUGHTER SHRIEKS HOWLS
IN A LITTLE MORE THAN AN HOUR ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE INVITED SOME ACCEPTED QUICKLY AND GLADLY OTHERS HAD TO BE COAXED BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE TOAST
AND HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER BOTH STRICKEN BY THE SAME MISFORTUNE INSTEAD OF FEELING SORROWFUL AND ASHAMED BEGAN TO POKE FUN AT EACH OTHER AND AFTER MUCH NONSENSE
I AM SICK

BEGINNING TO WAVER AND WEAKEN IN HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS
TO THINK THAT EVEN YESTERDAY THE IDEA CAME INTO YOUR HEAD TO RETURN HOME TO SEE YOUR FAIRY
NOR SLEEP NOR DISCOMFORT NO SOONER HAD THE WAGON STOPPED THAN THE LITTLE FAT MAN TURNED TO LAMP WICK WITH BOWS AND SMILES HE ASKED IN A WHEEDLING TONE
BELIEVE ME IF YOU DON'T COME YOU'LL BE SORRY
AND WHO HAS BEEN SO KIND TO ME AND BY THIS TIME I
HOW I WISH MIDNIGHT WOULD STRIKE WHY TO SEE YOU ALL SET OUT TOGETHER
AND TURNED BACK HE TOOK A LARGE COTTON BAG FROM A SHELF PUT IT ON HIS HEAD AND PULLED IT FAR DOWN TO HIS VERY NOSE THUS ADORNED HE WENT OUT
THAT IN THAT COUNTRY EACH
THOSE TWENTY FOUR DONKEYS INSTEAD OF BEING IRON SHOD
NO NO NO COME WITH US AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE HAPPY CRIED FOUR OTHER VOICES FROM THE WAGON
ONLY THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO A LAND WHERE WE SHALL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ALL THE RACKET WE LIKE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PINOCCHIO DID NOT ANSWER BUT SIGHED DEEPLY ONCE
I OH NO
FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
AND THIS SIGHT DOUBTLESS ANIMATED HIM VERY MUCH DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNEY THE TERRIBLE TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS WHICH BARTHOLEMY EXPERIENCED DURING HIS TRAMP ALONG THE COAST WERE SUCH AS COULD HAVE BEEN ENDURED ONLY BY ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND TOUGHEST OF MEN
WHICH HE MADE AS SHARP AS HE COULD THEN WITH THESE TOOLS HE UNDERTOOK THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RAFT WORKING AWAY LIKE A BEAVER AND USING THE SHARPENED NAILS INSTEAD OF HIS TEETH
AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS REPRESENTED TO THE GOVERNOR THAT HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE WOULD WORK MOST DISASTROUSLY FOR THE SPANISH SETTLERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS COULD DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THEM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO THESE DREADFUL BRETHREN OF THE COAST
BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
AND THEY FOUGHT EACH SCOUNDREL OF THEM LIKE THREE MEN AND THE SAVAGE FIGHT ENDED BY EVERY SPANISH SAILOR OR OFFICER WHO WAS NOT KILLED OR WOUNDED BEING FORCED TO STAY BELOW DECKS WHERE THE HATCHES WERE SECURELY FASTENED DOWN UPON THEM
AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
BARTHOLEMY PERCEIVED AN OLD BOARD IN WHICH THERE WERE SOME LONG AND HEAVY RUSTY NAILS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY THE INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELLER SET ABOUT A WORK WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WANTED A NEEDLE
BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DIGNIFIED OFFICIAL WHO FILLED THE POST OF GOVERNOR OF CUBA HE STORMED AND FAIRLY FOAMED AT THE MOUTH TO BE UTTERLY FOILED AND DISCOMFITED BY THIS RESURRECTED PIRATE
AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
AND WHERE THE WATER WHICH COVERED THE GROUND PREVENTED THE DOGS FROM FOLLOWING HIS SCENT HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPT A FEW ROOTS OF WATER PLANTS BUT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRIVATION AND THESE KEPT HIM ALIVE OFTEN HE HEARD THE HOUNDS BAYING ON THE DRY LAND ADJOINING THE MARSH
THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
AND WHO BEGAN TO RUB A CROW BAR ON A STONE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE PROPER SIZE BARTHOLEMY CAREFULLY KNOCKED ALL THE NAILS OUT OF THE BOARD AND THEN FINDING A LARGE FLAT STONE HE RUBBED DOWN ONE OF THEM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A RUDE KNIFE BLADE
ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
THERE WAS A WAIT IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD THERE PASSED SLOWLY THE INTENSE MOMENTS THAT PRECEDE THE TEMPEST A SINGLE RIFLE FLASHED IN A THICKET BEFORE THE REGIMENT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS
AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
AND WAS ABOUT TO FALL UPON A PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND OVER WHICH HE RULED FILLED THE GOVERNOR WITH RAGE AS WELL AS AMAZEMENT AND HE ORDERED A WELL ARMED SHIP WITH A LARGE CREW OF FIGHTING MEN TO SAIL IMMEDIATELY FOR DE LOS CAYOS
HE COULD SEE THE LOW LINE OF TRENCHES BUT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE A FEW IDLE FLAGS WERE PERCHED ON THE DIRT HILLS
HE DID NOT GO OUT IN SEARCH OF SHIPS BUT DIRECTED HIS VESSEL TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED DE LOS CAYOS ON THE COAST OF CUBA FOR HERE HE THOUGHT WAS A CHANCE FOR A GOOD AND EASY STROKE OF BUSINESS
BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
NEVER ONCE SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WHICH IS MEANT MUD WATER AND ROOTS BUT SWINGING HIMSELF BY HIS HANDS AND ARMS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT APE ONLY RESTING OCCASIONALLY DRAWING HIMSELF UPON A STOUT LIMB WHERE HE MIGHT SIT FOR A WHILE AND GET HIS BREATH
SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
WHEN THIS DIGNITARY HEARD THE STORY HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A PARTY OF OFFICERS TO THE SHIP AND COMMANDED THE CAPTAIN TO DELIVER THE PIRATE LEADER INTO THEIR CHARGE THE OTHER MEN WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE
HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
HE CUT DOWN A NUMBER OF SMALL TREES AND WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE SLENDER TRUNKS HE BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH REEDS AND OSIERS WHICH HE FOUND ON THE RIVER BANK SO AFTER INFINITE LABOR AND TRIAL HE CONSTRUCTED A RAFT WHICH WOULD BEAR HIM ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
THIS WAS A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY INTO THE SEA HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE SHORE OF THIS RIVER FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT IT GREW BUT LITTLE NARROWER AND HE COULD SEE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS HE COULD NOT SWIM
WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
BUT GETTING TIMELY NOTICE FROM THE CLERKS IN THE LAW COURTS WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS AND WHOM HE KEPT IN HIS PAY HE FLED WITH ALL HIS FAMILY IT WAS DECREED HOWEVER PERHAPS BY THE JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN THAT HE WHO HAD COMMITTED HIS CRIMES UPON THE SEA
SEVERED THE PRISON BARS OF HIS WIFE'S SOUL HE TOOK TO HIMSELF A CRUEL WOMAN WHO HAD NO SOONER SET FOOT IN HIS HOUSE THAN SHE BEGAN TO RIDE THE HIGH HORSE SAYING AM I COME HERE INDEED TO LOOK AFTER OTHER FOLK'S CHILDREN A PRETTY JOB I HAVE UNDERTAKEN
WHO WAS STILL PAYING COMPLIMENTS TO THE COUNTRY CLOWN WHEN THE MAN SAW THE DOG WITH THE LETTER IN HIS MOUTH HE ORDERED IT TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM BUT THE DOG WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO ANY ONE AND BOUNDING UP TO MENECHELLA HE PLACED IT IN HER HAND
BUT IF FOUR LOGS ARE NOT ENOW LET ME SPLIT FIVE AND TAKING UP A NEWLY GROUND AXE INSTEAD OF STRIKING THE WOOD HE STRUCK THE OGRESS ON THE NECK AND MADE HER FALL TO THE GROUND LIKE A PEAR THEN RUNNING QUICKLY TO THE GATE
AND TO ENJOY THE COOL SEA BREEZES AND WHILST A GREAT BANQUET WAS PREPARING NENNILLO HAD STEPPED OUT UPON A BALCONY OF THE PALACE ON THE ROCK TO SHARPEN SOME KNIVES PRIDING HIMSELF GREATLY ON ACQUIRING HONOUR FROM HIS OFFICE
WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH PREPARING THE FEAST THEN CORVETTO ENTERING WITH A LOOK OF COMPASSION SAID GOOD DAY MY GOOD WOMAN
MANY A MAN CURSES THE RAIN THAT FALLS UPON HIS HEAD AND KNOWS NOT THAT IT BRINGS ABUNDANCE TO DRIVE AWAY HUNGER AS IS SEEN IN THE PERSON OF A YOUNG MAN OF WHOM I WILL TELL YOU IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MERCHANT NAMED ANTONIELLO
AND IN FOUR SECONDS WAS ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE OGRE LIVED THEN PASSING UNSEEN INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH HE SLEPT HE HID HIMSELF UNDER THE BED AND WAITED AS STILL AS A MOUSE UNTIL NIGHT TO MAKE THE STARS LAUGH
SO THE NEXT MORNING ERE THE DAWN HAD HUNG OUT THE RED COUNTERPANE AT THE WINDOW OF THE EAST TO AIR IT JANNUCCIO TOOK THE CHILDREN ONE BY EACH HAND AND WITH A GOOD BASKETFUL OF THINGS TO EAT UPON HIS ARM HE LED THEM TO A WOOD
SEIZED HIS SWORD AND SOON MADE A SLAUGHTER OF THEM THE FAIRY SHOWERED THANKS UPON HIM FOR THIS BRAVE DEED DONE FOR HER SAKE AND INVITED HIM TO HER PALACE THAT SHE MIGHT REWARD HIM BUT CIENZO REPLIED IT IS NOTHING AT ALL THANK YOU KINDLY
WHERE IS THE COUNTERPANE REPLIED THE OGRE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO THE FLOOR HE TOUCHED CORVETTO'S FACE WHEREUPON HE SET UP A LOUD CRY THE IMP THE IMP HOLLO HERE LIGHTS RUN QUICKLY
THEN BEGGING HIS FATHER'S BLESSING CIENZO MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TUCKING THE ENCHANTED DOG UNDER HIS ARM HE WENT HIS WAY OUT OF THE CITY MAKING A WINTER OF TEARS WITH A SUMMER OF SIGHS
THAT HE CUT OFF ALL SEVEN HEADS WHICH FLEW FROM THE NECKS LIKE PEAS FROM THE PAN WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT THE TONGUES AND PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET HE FLUNG THE HEADS A MILE APART FROM THE BODY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER COME TOGETHER AGAIN
KNOWING HOWEVER THAT WALLS ARE NOT LEVELLED BY THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE BATTERING RAM THEY RESOLVED TO TRY THEIR LUCK A SECOND TIME AND SAID TO THE KING WE WISH YOU JOY OF THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE IT WILL INDEED BE AN ORNAMENT TO THE ROYAL STABLE
SHOULD COME TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND HE WOULD THERE RECEIVE JOYFUL NEWS OF THEM JANNUCCIO WHO HAD ALL THIS TIME PASSED A SAD AND DISCONSOLATE LIFE BELIEVING THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES
SO SAYING HE PULLED THE TONGUES OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE THE COUNTRYMAN WAS STRUCK ALL OF A HEAP NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT AND THE MORE SO WHEN MENECHELLA ADDED THIS IS THE MAN AH YOU DOG OF A COUNTRYMAN A PRETTY TRICK YOU HAVE PLAYED ME
FROM THAT WAS SEEN A LARGE BEAR HERE SPRANG FORTH A LION THERE CAME RUNNING A WOLF BUT THE YOUTH BY THE AID OF BRIDLE AND SPUR DISTANCED THE MOUNTAIN AND GALLOPING WITHOUT STOP TO THE CITY
BREAK AND GLUE TOGETHER OF WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU ONE INSTANCE IN THE STORY THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF WIDE RIVER AN EXCELLENT YOUTH NAMED CORVETTO WHO FOR HIS GOOD CONDUCT
I KISS THY DELICATE LITTLE HANDS FROM THE INN OF THE FLOWER POT SUNDAY HAVING WRITTEN THIS LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH A WAFER HE PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE ENCHANTED DOG SAYING
WHEN SUDDENLY SHE FOUND A THING TO AMAZE HER INSIDE THE FISH BEAUTIFUL FIELDS AND FINE GARDENS AND A SPLENDID MANSION WITH ALL THAT HEART COULD DESIRE IN WHICH SHE LIVED LIKE A PRINCESS THEN SHE WAS CARRIED QUICKLY BY THE FISH TO A ROCK
WHEN THE OGRE HEARD THIS CHALLENGE HE RAN LIKE MAD AT CORVETTO TO MAKE A HASH OF HIM BUT RUSHING FURIOUSLY TOWARDS THE GATE DOWN HE TUMBLED WITH ALL HIS COMPANIONS HEAD OVER HEELS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
COME DOWN HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHO I AM THEN CIENZO WITHOUT LOSING COURAGE ANSWERED WAIT AWHILE I'LL COME SO HE GROPED ABOUT UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A LADDER WHICH LED TO A CELLAR
PUTS A CARNIVAL MASK ON THE FACE OF THE SKY AND AS SOON AS THE OGRE AND HIS WIFE WERE GONE TO BED CORVETTO STRIPPED THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER VERY QUIETLY AND WISHING TO STEAL THE COUNTERPANE OF THE BED LIKEWISE HE BEGAN TO PULL IT GENTLY
AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD LOST THE CHILDREN AND WHEN HE HAD RELATED THE STORY HOW HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE THEM TO THE WOOD THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A GOOD SCOLDING CALLING HIM A BLOCKHEAD FOR ALLOWING A WOMAN TO PUT HER HEEL UPON HIS NECK
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT YOU SO MANY FINE THINGS ONLY TO BE MADE THE SLAVE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT MY OWN POOR JANNUCCIO WHO SAW THAT MATTERS WERE GROWING RATHER TOO WARM IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE LITTLE ONES AND RETURNED TO THE WOOD
THAT ONE COULD NEVER SEE THE SUN THERE THIS OGRE HAD A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT WERE FORMED WITH A PENCIL AND AMONGST OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS IT COULD SPEAK LIKE ANY MAN
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED A GREAT TREASURE HE WISHED TO GIVE PART OF IT TO CIENZO BUT THE LATTER REFUSED AND TAKING HIS DOG AND MOUNTING ONCE MORE ON HIS HORSE SET OUT AGAIN ON HIS TRAVELS
AND YOU SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REGRET HAVING DONE ME THIS SERVICE CORVETTO KNEW WELL THAT THIS DRUM WAS SOUNDED BY THOSE WHO WISHED HIM ILL NEVERTHELESS TO OBEY THE KING HE SET OUT AND TOOK THE ROAD TO THE MOUNTAIN
WHERE THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM THE KING AND THE VEXATION OF THE COURTIERS WHO WERE BURSTING WITH SPITE ARE NOT TO BE TOLD NEVERTHELESS THEY LAID A PLAN TO FALL UPON CORVETTO WITH THE REAR GUARD OF THEIR ROGUERY AND WENT AGAIN TO THE KING
READY TO HELP YOU TOOTH AND NAIL WELCOME THEN SAID THE OGRESS AND AS YOU PROFFER ME SO MUCH KINDNESS JUST HELP ME TO SPLIT FOUR LOGS OF WOOD
WHO HAD A SON CALLED CIENZO IT HAPPENED THAT CIENZO WAS ONE DAY THROWING STONES ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES AND BY CHANCE BROKE HIS COMPANION'S HEAD WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER
ANOTHER TIME I WILL ACCEPT THE FAVOUR BUT NOW I AM IN HASTE ON BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE SO SAYING HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
THEN THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO GO NEARER TO THE FISH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR PERHAPS THIS ADVENTURE MIGHT CONCERN HIM AS SOON AS NENNILLO APPROACHED THE FISH IT RAISED UP ITS HEAD UPON THE ROCK AND OPENING ITS THROAT SIX PALMS WIDE
BUT CORVETTO WHO WAS ENCHANTED AND PERCEIVED THE TRAPS AND DISCOVERED THE TRICKS WAS AWARE OF ALL THE INTRIGUES AND THE AMBUSCADES THE PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES OF HIS ENEMIES HE KEPT HIS EARS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND HIS EYES OPEN
THERE DWELT AN OGRE THE MOST INHUMAN AND SAVAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN IN OGRELAND WHO BEING PERSECUTED BY THE KING HAD FORTIFIED HIMSELF IN A LONESOME WOOD ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE NO BIRD EVER FLEW AND WAS SO THICK AND TANGLED
THE NEWS OF THIS PROCLAMATION FLEW THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY TILL AT LAST IT CAME TO THE EARS OF CIENZO WHO SAID TO HIMSELF VERILY I AM A GREAT BLOCKHEAD I HAD HOLD OF FORTUNE BY THE FORELOCK AND I LET HER ESCAPE OUT OF MY HAND
AND TAKE THIS TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER GIVE IT TO NO ONE ELSE BUT PLACE IT IN THE HAND OF THAT SILVER FACED MAIDEN HERSELF AWAY RAN THE DOG TO THE PALACE AS IF HE WERE FLYING AND GOING UP THE STAIRS HE FOUND THE KING
WILL GIVE YOU SHELTER FROM THE SUN WHERE THE RIVER MORE CHARITABLE WILL GIVE YOU DRINK WITHOUT POISON AND THE EARTH MORE KIND WILL GIVE YOU A PILLOW OF GRASS WITHOUT DANGER AND WHEN YOU WANT FOOD FOLLOW THIS LITTLE PATH OF BRAN WHICH I HAVE MADE FOR YOU IN A STRAIGHT LINE
IT WAS HE WHO BEGAN AND PROVOKED ME WE ARE BUT BOYS AND THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUARREL AFTER ALL TIS A FIRST FAULT AND THE KING IS A MAN OF REASON BUT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT GREAT HARM CAN HE DO ME THE WIDE WORLD IS ONE'S HOME
AND GOING DOWN HE SAW A LIGHTED LAMP AND THREE GHOST LOOKING FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING A PITEOUS CLAMOUR CRYING ALAS MY BEAUTEOUS TREASURE I MUST LOSE THEE WHEN CIENZO SAW THIS
TILL THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY WITH THE NOISE BUT CORVETTO AFTER THROWING THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE WINDOW LET HIMSELF DROP DOWN UPON THEM THEN MAKING UP A GOOD BUNDLE HE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO THE CITY
HOW COMES HE BY THIS LUCK THAT NOT A DAY PASSES THAT HE RECEIVES SOME NEW FAVOURS WHILST WE ARE FOR EVER GOING BACKWARD LIKE A ROPE MAKER AND GETTING FROM BAD TO WORSE THOUGH WE SLAVE LIKE DOGS TOIL LIKE FIELD LABOURERS
AND YOU CAN COME AND SEEK WHAT YOU REQUIRE SO SAYING HE TURNED AWAY HIS FACE NOT TO LET HIMSELF BE SEEN TO WEEP AND DISHEARTEN THE POOR LITTLE CREATURES WHEN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA HAD EATEN ALL THAT WAS IN THE BASKET
THEN GIVING THEM BOTH A KISS HE RETURNED WEEPING TO HIS HOUSE BUT AT THE HOUR WHEN ALL CREATURES SUMMONED BY THE CONSTABLES OF NIGHT PAY TO NATURE THE TAX OF NEEDFUL REPOSE
THAT HE CREPT INTO A HOLLOW TREE AND NENNELLA SET OFF RUNNING AT FULL SPEED AND RAN UNTIL SHE CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND FOUND HERSELF ON THE SEASHORE NOW IT HAPPENED THAT SOME PIRATES WHO HAD LANDED THERE TO GET FUEL SAW NENNELLA AND CARRIED HER OFF
AND THE HATRED OF THEIR STEPMOTHER BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOLLECT THE NAME OF THEIR FATHER NOR OF THEIR HOME THE PRINCE CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE ISSUED COMMANDING THAT WHOEVER HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN NAMED NENNILLO AND NENNELLA IN A WOOD
HE WENT HIS WAY UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN HE CAME TO A WOOD THAT KEPT THE MULE OF THE SUN OUTSIDE ITS LIMITS WHILE IT WAS AMUSING ITSELF WITH SILENCE AND THE SHADES AN OLD HOUSE STOOD THERE AT THE FOOT OF A TOWER
AND THEIR CAPTAIN TOOK HER HOME WITH HIM WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVING JUST LOST A LITTLE GIRL TOOK HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER MEANTIME NENNILLO WHO HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE DOGS
BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
AND JUMPING UP EXCLAIMED HOLLO THERE YOU ARE GETTING TOO TROUBLESOME BUT LEAVE OFF THIS SPORT AND LET'S HAVE A BOUT OF IT IF YOU HAVE ANY PLUCK FOR YOU HAVE FOUND THE LAST TO YOUR SHOE AT THESE WORDS HE HEARD A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER AND THEN A HOLLOW VOICE SAYING
HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH AMAZEMENT AND ORDERED A NUMBER OF SERVANTS TO TRY WHETHER BY ANY MEANS THEY COULD ENSNARE THE FISH AND DRAW IT TO LAND AT LAST HEARING THE WORDS BROTHER BROTHER CONTINUALLY REPEATED HE ASKED ALL HIS SERVANTS ONE BY ONE
THEN JANNUCCIO SAID MY LITTLE CHILDREN STAY HERE IN THIS WOOD AND EAT AND DRINK MERRILY BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING FOLLOW THIS LINE OF ASHES WHICH I HAVE BEEN STREWING AS WE CAME ALONG THIS WILL BE A CLUE TO LEAD YOU OUT OF THE LABYRINTH AND BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME
HE ONLY BRINGS INTO HIS HOUSE THE CAUSE OF THEIR RUIN THERE NEVER YET WAS A STEPMOTHER WHO LOOKED KINDLY ON THE CHILDREN OF ANOTHER OR IF BY CHANCE SUCH A ONE WERE EVER FOUND SHE WOULD BE REGARDED AS A MIRACLE AND BE CALLED A WHITE CROW
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
PROMISING TO SCORE IT UP WITH THE CHALK OF GRATITUDE AT THE TAVERN OF MEMORY SO CORVETTO INSTANTLY SET OUT HEELS OVER HEAD AND ARRIVING AT THE OGRE'S PALACE HE FOUND THAT THE OGRESS WHILST HER HUSBAND WAS GONE TO INVITE THE KINSFOLK
WHO WAS ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT AT THE TAPESTRY WHICH WAS NOT ONLY OF SILK EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUT HAD BESIDES MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEVICES AND THOUGHTS WORKED ON IT AND AMONGST THE REST IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FALSE LOON
WISHED TO CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND THE LADDER WHEREAT HE SET UP SUCH A CRY
THE MOST TERRIBLE MONSTER THAT EVER WAS SEEN WITH THE CREST OF A COCK THE HEAD OF A CAT EYES OF FIRE THE MOUTH OF A BULLDOG THE WINGS OF A BAT THE CLAWS OF A BEAR AND THE TAIL OF A SERPENT NOW THIS DRAGON SWALLOWS A MAIDEN EVERY DAY
ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE ILL IN BED AND NOW YOU ARE SLAVING THUS AND HAVE NO PITY ON YOUR OWN FLESH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO REPLIED THE OGRESS I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME I AM HERE
THEREUPON THE OGRE SUDDENLY STARTING UP TOLD HIS WIFE NOT TO PULL SO FOR SHE WAS DRAGGING ALL THE CLOTHES OFF HIM AND WOULD GIVE HIM HIS DEATH OF COLD
WHERE GIVING THE CHILDREN ANOTHER BASKETFUL OF FOOD HE SAID TO THEM YOU SEE MY DEARS HOW THIS WIFE OF MINE WHO IS COME TO MY HOUSE TO BE YOUR RUIN AND A NAIL IN MY HEART HATES YOU THEREFORE REMAIN IN THIS WOOD WHERE THE TREES MORE COMPASSIONATE
BUT IF ANY ONE WERE TO ASK ME WHERE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY MIGHT TRULY BE FOUND I SHOULD KNOW OF NO OTHER PLACE TO NAME THAN THE COURT WHERE DETRACTION ALWAYS WEARS THE MASK OF AMUSEMENT WHERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CUT AND SEW UP WOUND AND HEAL
BUT THE MASTER BEING IN FEAR OF ROBBERS WOULD NOT OPEN TO HIM SO THE POOR YOUTH WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN IN THE RUINED OLD HOUSE HE TURNED HIS HORSE OUT TO GRAZE IN A MEADOW AND THREW HIMSELF ON SOME STRAW HE FOUND WITH THE DOG BY HIS SIDE
WHICH WAS A THING WORTHY OF A KING ADDED THAT HE OUGHT TO ENDEAVOUR BY ALL MEANS TO GET IT OUT OF THE OGRE'S CLAWS AND THAT CORVETTO WAS JUST THE LAD TO DO THIS AS HE WAS EXPERT AND CLEVER AT ESCAPING OUT OF THE FIRE
UPON THE SEA SHOULD SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT OF THEM FOR HAVING EMBARKED IN A SMALL BOAT NO SOONER WAS HE UPON THE OPEN SEA THAN THERE CAME SUCH A STORM OF WIND AND TUMULT OF THE WAVES THAT THE BOAT WAS UPSET AND ALL WERE DROWNED ALL EXCEPT NENNELLA
AS CORVETTO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO SERVE YOU IT WOULD BE NO GREAT MATTER FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A SIGNAL PLEASURE TO GET THE OGRE'S PALACE WHICH IS FIT FOR AN EMPEROR TO LIVE IN FOR IT HAS SO MANY ROOMS AND CHAMBERS INSIDE AND OUT
THERE WAS A COCK IN THE ACT OF CROWING AT DAYBREAK AND OUT OF ITS MOUTH WAS SEEN COMING A MOTTO IN TUSCAN IF I ONLY SEE YOU AND IN ANOTHER PART A DROOPING HELIOTROPE WITH A TUSCAN MOTTO AT SUNSET
THEN MENECHELLA ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND MAKING A CURTSEY TO THE KING SHE GAVE HIM THE LETTER TO READ AND WHEN THE KING HAD READ IT HE ORDERED THAT THE DOG SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO SEE WHERE HE WENT AND THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
IN ORDER NOT TO TAKE A FALSE STEP WELL KNOWING THAT THE FORTUNE OF COURTIERS IS AS GLASS BUT THE HIGHER THE LAD CONTINUED TO RISE THE LOWER THE OTHERS FELL TILL AT LAST BEING PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS FEET
TO KEEP THEM HERE TO PLAGUE MY VERY LIFE OUT GO TAKE THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT I'LL NOT WAIT FOR THE CROWING OF COCKS AND THE CACKLING OF HENS OR ELSE BE ASSURED THAT TO MORROW MORNING I'LL GO OFF TO MY PARENTS HOUSE FOR YOU DO NOT DESERVE ME
AFTER A WHILE HE ARRIVED AT A WILD AND DREARY FOREST SO DARK THAT IT MADE YOU SHUDDER THERE UPON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE FOUND A FAIRY SURROUNDED BY A BAND OF ROBBERS CIENZO SEEING THE WICKED INTENTION OF THE ROBBERS
WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED EVEN A HERO SO THEY WENT SLOWLY ALONG THE PATH OF ASHES AND IT WAS ALREADY MIDNIGHT ERE THEY REACHED THEIR HOME WHEN PASCOZZA THEIR STEPMOTHER SAW THE CHILDREN SHE ACTED NOT LIKE A WOMAN BUT A PERFECT FURY
BUT I MUST FIND SOME MEANS OF GETTING RID OF THESE CREATURES OR IT WILL COST ME MY LIFE BETTER TO BLUSH ONCE THAN TO GROW PALE A HUNDRED TIMES SO I'VE DONE WITH THEM FOR I AM RESOLVED TO SEND THEM AWAY OR TO LEAVE THE HOUSE MYSELF FOR EVER
THERE WAS ONCE A GOOD MAN NAMED JANNUCCIO WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA WHOM HE LOVED AS MUCH AS HIS OWN LIFE BUT DEATH HAVING WITH THE SMOOTH FILE OF TIME
HAVING BY THE FAVOUR OF SOL IN LEO SAVED THY LIFE I HEAR THAT ANOTHER PLUMES HIMSELF WITH MY LABOURS THAT ANOTHER CLAIMS THE REWARD OF THE SERVICE WHICH I RENDERED THOU THEREFORE WHO WAST PRESENT AT THE DRAGON'S DEATH
FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
I'VE CAUGHT HIM AND
AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
WAS BELOVED BY HIS MASTER AND FOR THIS VERY CAUSE WAS DISLIKED AND HATED BY ALL THE COURTIERS THESE COURTIERS WERE FILLED WITH SPITE AND MALICE AND BURSTING WITH ENVY AT THE KINDNESS WHICH THE KING SHOWED TO CORVETTO
WHO HAVING HAD NO SHARE IN THE CORSAIR'S ROBBERIES LIKE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ESCAPED THE DANGER FOR JUST THEN A LARGE ENCHANTED FISH WHICH WAS SWIMMING ABOUT THE BOAT OPENED ITS HUGE THROAT AND SWALLOWED HER DOWN
NOW THE COURTIERS WHO KNEW HOW WICKED THE OGRE WAS HOW THICK THE WOOD HOW HIGH THE MOUNTAIN AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO GET AT THE HORSE WENT TO THE KING
BUT SCARCELY HAD HE CLOSED HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE BARKING OF THE DOG AND HEARD FOOTSTEPS STIRRING IN THE HOUSE CIENZO WHO WAS BOLD AND VENTURESOME SEIZED HIS SWORD AND BEGAN TO LAY ABOUT HIM IN THE DARK
SO THAT ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY CORNER OF THE PALACE THEY DID NOTHING BUT TATTLE AND WHISPER MURMUR AND GRUMBLE AT THE POOR LAD SAYING WHAT SORCERY HAS THIS FELLOW PRACTISED ON THE KING THAT HE TAKES SUCH A FANCY TO HIM
HE CAME AT LAST TO THE PALACE OF A KING WHICH WAS ALL HUNG WITH MOURNING SO THAT IT MADE ONE'S HEART BLACK TO LOOK AT IT WHEN CIENZO INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THE MOURNING THE FOLKS ANSWERED A DRAGON WITH SEVEN HEADS HAS MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
AND BEWAILING THE SAD FATE OF THE POOR GIRL THEN THE DRAGON CAME OUT OF THE CAVE BUT CIENZO LAID HOLD OF HIS SWORD AND STRUCK OFF A HEAD IN A TRICE BUT THE DRAGON WENT AND RUBBED HIS NECK ON A CERTAIN PLANT WHICH GREW NOT FAR OFF
WHICH MADE SUCH A FURIOUS BARKING THAT THE PRINCE SENT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE PRETTY LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT TELL WHO WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE ORDERED ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN TO SET HIM UPON HIS SADDLE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ROYAL PALACE
THESE AND OTHER WORDS FELL FROM THEIR MOUTHS LIKE POISONED ARROWS AIMED AT THE RUIN OF CORVETTO AS AT A TARGET ALAS FOR HIM WHO IS CONDEMNED TO THAT DEN THE COURT WHERE FLATTERY IS SOLD BY THE KILDERKIN
THAT HE COULD CARVE A JOINT TO A HAIR NOW ABOUT THIS TIME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP WHO HAD TAKEN NENNELLA TO HIS HOUSE WAS A SEA ROBBER AND THE PEOPLE WISHED TO TAKE HIM PRISONER
AND SUDDENLY THE HEAD JOINED ITSELF ON AGAIN LIKE A LIZARD JOINING ITSELF TO ITS TAIL CIENZO SEEING THIS EXCLAIMED HE WHO DARES NOT WINS NOT AND SETTING HIS TEETH HE STRUCK SUCH A FURIOUS BLOW
WHOM THE FATHER EMBRACED AND KISSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT BEING SATISFIED THEN THE PRINCE MADE HIM PULL OFF HIS JACKET AND HAD HIM DRESSED LIKE A LORD AND SENDING FOR JANNUCCIO'S WIFE HE SHOWED HER THOSE TWO GOLDEN PIPPINS
THEN GOING VERY QUIETLY TO THE OGRE'S STABLE HE SADDLED AND MOUNTED THE HORSE AND FIXING HIS FEET FIRMLY IN THE STIRRUP TOOK HIS WAY BACK BUT AS SOON AS THE HORSE SAW HIMSELF SPURRED OUT OF THE PALACE HE CRIED ALOUD HOLLO
AND NOW THE LOT HAS FALLEN ON MENECHELLA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING SO THERE IS GREAT WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE ROYAL PALACE SINCE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN ALL THE LAND IS DOOMED TO BE DEVOURED BY THIS HORRID BEAST
BUT BESIDE ALL THOSE OF WHOM YOU MAY HAVE HEARD I WILL NOW TELL YOU OF ANOTHER TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HEARTLESS STEPMOTHERS WHOM YOU WILL CONSIDER WELL DESERVING THE PUNISHMENT SHE PURCHASED FOR HERSELF WITH READY MONEY
MALIGNITY AND ILL OFFICES ARE MEASURED OUT IN BUSHELS DECEIT AND TREACHERY ARE WEIGHED BY THE TON BUT WHO CAN COUNT ALL THE ATTEMPTS THESE COURTIERS MADE TO BRING HIM TO GRIEF
THE KING WHO KNEW NOT THAT UNDER THE FLOWERS OF THESE WORDS A SERPENT WAS CONCEALED INSTANTLY CALLED CORVETTO AND SAID TO HIM IF YOU LOVE ME SEE THAT IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER YOU OBTAIN FOR ME THE HORSE OF MY ENEMY THE OGRE
THE POOR HUSBAND WHO HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR THIS WOMAN SAID TO HER SOFTLY WIFE DON'T BE ANGRY FOR SUGAR IS DEAR AND TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE THE COCK CROWS I WILL REMOVE THIS ANNOYANCE IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
THEN CHOOSING A VERY RICH LORD AMONG HIS VASSALS HE GAVE HIM NENNELLA TO WIFE AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER GREAT LORD TO NENNILLO ALLOWING THEM ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON WITH THEIR FATHER SO THAT THEY WANTED FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD
BUT WHAT A PITY YOU HAVE NOT THE OGRE'S TAPESTRY WHICH IS A THING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WORDS CAN TELL AND WOULD SPREAD YOUR FAME FAR AND WIDE THERE IS NO ONE HOWEVER ABLE TO PROCURE THIS TREASURE BUT CORVETTO WHO IS JUST THE LAD TO DO SUCH A KIND OF SERVICE
HE DUG A DEEP HOLE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE AND COVERING IT OVER WITH BUSHES AND EARTH HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND THE GATE AS SOON AS CORVETTO SAW THE OGRE COMING WITH HIS KINSFOLK HE SET UP A LOUD CRY IN THE COURTYARD STOP STOP
NENNILLO AT FIRST PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE VOICE BUT THE PRINCE WHO WAS STANDING ON ANOTHER BALCONY AND HAD ALSO HEARD IT TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SOUND CAME AND SAW THE FISH AND WHEN HE AGAIN HEARD THE SAME WORDS
TO HAVE ALL THIS TROUBLE AND BE FOR EVER TEASED BY A COUPLE OF SQUALLING BRATS WOULD THAT I HAD BROKEN MY NECK ERE I EVER CAME TO THIS PLACE TO HAVE BAD FOOD WORSE DRINK AND GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
AND STUPOR IS IN DELIGHT THE KING WHO HAD A FRUITFUL BRAIN WHICH CONCEIVED QUICKLY CALLED CORVETTO AGAIN AND TELLING HIM THE GREAT LONGING THAT HAD SEIZED HIM FOR THE OGRE'S PALACE BEGGED HIM TO ADD THIS SERVICE TO ALL THE OTHERS HE HAD DONE HIM
SO IT SHALL BE DONE SAID THE PRINCE THE GOAT HAS BUTTED AT HERSELF QUICK NOW YOU HAVE PASSED THE SENTENCE AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT FOR HAVING BORNE THESE BEAUTIFUL STEPCHILDREN SUCH MALICE SO HE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE INSTANTLY EXECUTED
ARRIVED AT THE COURT WHERE HE PRESENTED THE HORSE TO THE KING THEN THE KING EMBRACED HIM MORE THAN A SON AND PULLING OUT HIS PURSE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH CROWN PIECES AT THIS THE RAGE OF THE COURTIERS KNEW NO BOUNDS
A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
