GRASP AND THUS HOLD IT UP TO THE PUBLIC GAZE THE VERY IDEAL OF IGNOMINY
WHEN THEY FOUND VOICE TO SPEAK IT WAS AT FIRST ONLY TO UTTER REMARKS AND INQUIRIES SUCH AS ANY TWO ACQUAINTANCES MIGHT HAVE MADE ABOUT THE GLOOMY SKY THE THREATENING STORM AND NEXT
SHRINKING WITHIN HIMSELF AND PRESSING HIS HAND NERVOUSLY AGAINST HIS HEART A GESTURE THAT HAD GROWN INVOLUNTARY WITH HIM THINK FOR ME HESTER THOU ART STRONG RESOLVE FOR ME
A BOLDNESS AND ROTUNDITY OF SPEECH AMONG THESE MATRONS AS MOST OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THAT WOULD STARTLE US AT THE PRESENT DAY
WHICH INDEED SHE HAD WROUGHT FOR THE OCCASION IN PRISON
HEARD NOTHING KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS AROUND HIM BUT THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT TOOK UP THE FEEBLE FRAME AND CARRIED IT ALONG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE BURDEN AND CONVERTING IT TO SPIRIT LIKE ITSELF
BY MEANS OF THEM THE SUFFERER'S CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN KEPT IN AN IRRITATED STATE THE TENDENCY OF WHICH WAS NOT TO CURE BY WHOLESOME PAIN
BUT HAD NONE OF THE HEARTLESSNESS OF ANOTHER SOCIAL STATE WHICH WOULD FIND ONLY A THEME FOR JEST IN AN EXHIBITION LIKE THE PRESENT EVEN HAD THERE BEEN A DISPOSITION TO TURN THE MATTER INTO RIDICULE IT MUST HAVE BEEN REPRESSED AND OVERPOWERED BY THE SOLEMN PRESENCE OF MEN NO LESS DIGNIFIED THAN THE GOVERNOR
BEGIN ALL ANEW HAST THOU EXHAUSTED POSSIBILITY IN THE FAILURE OF THIS ONE TRIAL NOT SO THE FUTURE IS YET FULL OF TRIAL AND SUCCESS THERE IS HAPPINESS TO BE ENJOYED
ON THE OTHER HAND A PENALTY WHICH IN OUR DAYS WOULD INFER A DEGREE OF MOCKING INFAMY AND RIDICULE MIGHT THEN BE INVESTED WITH ALMOST AS STERN A DIGNITY AS THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH ITSELF IT WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE NOTED ON THE SUMMER MORNING
WAS TO DIE UPON THE GALLOWS IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR ON THE PART OF THE SPECTATORS AS BEFITTED A PEOPLE AMONG WHOM RELIGION AND LAW WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL
THANK THEMSELVES IF THEIR OWN WIVES AND DAUGHTERS GO ASTRAY
WHO CAME IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE MILITARY ESCORT WERE BETTER WORTH A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER'S EYE EVEN IN OUTWARD DEMEANOUR THEY SHOWED A STAMP OF MAJESTY THAT MADE THE WARRIOR'S HAUGHTY STRIDE LOOK VULGAR IF NOT ABSURD
THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD STOOD FULLY REVEALED BEFORE THE CROWD IT SEEMED TO BE HER FIRST IMPULSE TO CLASP THE INFANT CLOSELY TO HER BOSOM
WHICH IT WAS HIS BUSINESS TO ADMINISTER IN ITS FINAL AND CLOSEST APPLICATION TO THE OFFENDER STRETCHING FORTH THE OFFICIAL STAFF IN HIS LEFT HAND HE LAID HIS RIGHT UPON THE SHOULDER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHOM HE THUS DREW FORWARD UNTIL ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE PRISON DOOR SHE REPELLED HIM
OUT OF WHAT THEY WORTHY GENTLEMEN MEANT FOR A PUNISHMENT IT WERE WELL MUTTERED THE MOST IRON VISAGED OF THE OLD DAMES IF WE STRIPPED MADAME HESTER'S RICH GOWN OFF HER DAINTY SHOULDERS
A CROWD OF EAGER AND CURIOUS SCHOOLBOYS UNDERSTANDING LITTLE OF THE MATTER IN HAND EXCEPT THAT IT GAVE THEM A HALF HOLIDAY RAN BEFORE HER PROGRESS
HERE SEEN ONLY BY HER EYES ARTHUR DIMMESDALE FALSE TO GOD AND MAN MIGHT BE FOR ONE MOMENT TRUE HE STARTED AT A THOUGHT THAT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM
WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SQUARE CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND LARGE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLONIAL MAGISTRATES SO FAR AS A DEMEANOUR OF NATURAL AUTHORITY WAS CONCERNED THE MOTHER COUNTRY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO SEE
WAS SLIGHTLY DEFORMED WITH THE LEFT SHOULDER A TRIFLE HIGHER THAN THE RIGHT NEXT ROSE BEFORE HER
AND SEEMED TO BE BORNE UPWARD LIKE A FLOATING SEA BIRD ON THE LONG HEAVES AND SWELLS OF SOUND BUT SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HER FORMER MOOD BY THE SHIMMER OF THE SUNSHINE ON THE WEAPONS AND BRIGHT ARMOUR OF THE MILITARY COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER THE MUSIC AND FORMED THE HONORARY ESCORT OF THE PROCESSION
AND LEVELLING THEIR STERN REGARDS AT HESTER PRYNNE YES AT HERSELF WHO STOOD ON THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY AN INFANT ON HER ARM AND THE LETTER A IN SCARLET FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD THREAD UPON HER BOSOM
WHILE THE PROCESSION PASSED
ON SOLID WISDOM AND SAD COLOURED EXPERIENCE ON ENDOWMENTS OF THAT GRAVE AND WEIGHTY ORDER WHICH GAVE THE IDEA OF PERMANENCE
NOR WONTED TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF DISEMBODIED BEINGS EACH A GHOST AND AWE STRICKEN AT THE OTHER GHOST THEY WERE AWE STRICKEN LIKEWISE AT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE CRISIS FLUNG BACK TO THEM THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
TRUTH WAS THE ONE VIRTUE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE HELD FAST AND DID HOLD FAST THROUGH ALL EXTREMITY SAVE WHEN THY GOOD THY LIFE THY FAME WERE PUT IN QUESTION THEN I CONSENTED
WAS PRETERNATURALLY ACTIVE AND KEPT BRINGING UP OTHER SCENES THAN THIS ROUGHLY HEWN STREET OF A LITTLE
THUS THEY WENT ONWARD NOT BOLDLY BUT STEP BY STEP INTO THE THEMES THAT WERE BROODING DEEPEST IN THEIR HEARTS SO LONG ESTRANGED BY FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEY NEEDED
BUT THOU SHALT LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND THEE
SEEMED TO EXPRESS THE ATTITUDE OF HER SPIRIT THE DESPERATE RECKLESSNESS OF HER MOOD BY ITS WILD AND PICTURESQUE PECULIARITY BUT THE POINT WHICH DREW ALL EYES AND AS IT WERE TRANSFIGURED THE WEARER
ONE GLANCE OF RECOGNITION SHE HAD IMAGINED MUST NEEDS PASS BETWEEN THEM SHE
OF AN IMPULSIVE AND PASSIONATE NATURE SHE HAD FORTIFIED HERSELF TO ENCOUNTER THE STINGS AND VENOMOUS STABS OF PUBLIC CONTUMELY
SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LAID DOWN ON THE FOREST LEAVES AND DIED THERE AT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE'S FEET OH ARTHUR CRIED SHE FORGIVE ME IN ALL THINGS ELSE I HAVE STRIVEN TO BE TRUE
WAS THAT SCARLET LETTER SO FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED AND ILLUMINATED UPON HER BOSOM IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A SPELL TAKING HER OUT OF THE ORDINARY RELATIONS WITH HUMANITY
OR ITS VOLUME OF TONE GOODWIVES SAID A HARD FEATURED DAME OF FIFTY
YET THOSE SAME BLEARED OPTICS HAD A STRANGE PENETRATING POWER
WRITE ACT DO ANYTHING SAVE TO LIE DOWN AND DIE GIVE UP THIS NAME OF ARTHUR DIMMESDALE
AND THOU ARTHUR DIMMESDALE DOST THOU YET LIVE IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THEY THUS QUESTIONED ONE ANOTHER'S ACTUAL AND BODILY EXISTENCE AND EVEN DOUBTED OF THEIR OWN SO STRANGELY DID THEY MEET IN THE DIM WOOD
BEFORE SOCIETY SHALL HAVE GROWN CORRUPT ENOUGH TO SMILE INSTEAD OF SHUDDERING AT IT THE WITNESSES OF HESTER PRYNNE'S DISGRACE HAD NOT YET PASSED BEYOND THEIR SIMPLICITY THEY WERE STERN ENOUGH TO LOOK UPON HER DEATH HAD THAT BEEN THE SENTENCE WITHOUT A MURMUR AT ITS SEVERITY
THE INDELICACY THE HORRIBLE UGLINESS OF THIS EXPOSURE OF A SICK AND GUILTY HEART
THE TEACHER AND APOSTLE OF THE RED MEN
CLAD IN GARMENTS SO SOMBRE AND SO LITTLE RELIEVED FROM THE GRAY TWILIGHT
THE FOREST WAS OBSCURE AROUND THEM AND CREAKED WITH A BLAST THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH IT THE BOUGHS WERE TOSSING HEAVILY ABOVE THEIR HEADS WHILE ONE SOLEMN OLD TREE GROANED DOLEFULLY TO ANOTHER
WAS WHAT HESTER COULD NOT BEAR AND LIVE WILT THOU YET FORGIVE ME SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WILT THOU NOT FROWN WILT THOU FORGIVE
INDESCRIBABLE GRACE WHICH IS NOW RECOGNISED AS ITS INDICATION AND NEVER HAD HESTER PRYNNE APPEARED MORE LADYLIKE IN THE ANTIQUE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM THAN AS SHE ISSUED FROM THE PRISON
INDUCEMENTS POWERFUL ENOUGH IN THE ALMOST WORSHIPPING RESPECT OF THE COMMUNITY TO WIN THE MOST ASPIRING AMBITION INTO ITS SERVICE EVEN POLITICAL POWER AS IN THE CASE OF INCREASE MATHER WAS WITHIN THE GRASP OF A SUCCESSFUL PRIEST
YOUR PRESENT LIFE IS NOT LESS HOLY IN VERY TRUTH THAN IT SEEMS IN PEOPLE'S EYES IS THERE NO REALITY IN THE PENITENCE THUS SEALED AND WITNESSED BY GOOD WORKS AND WHEREFORE SHOULD IT NOT BRING YOU PEACE
GREATLY FOR THE PUBLIC BEHOOF IF WE WOMEN BEING OF MATURE AGE AND CHURCH MEMBERS IN GOOD REPUTE SHOULD HAVE THE HANDLING OF SUCH MALEFACTRESSES AS THIS HESTER PRYNNE WHAT THINK YE GOSSIPS IF THE HUSSY STOOD UP FOR JUDGMENT BEFORE US FIVE
AND COMES UNDER THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF RESPECTABILITY THESE PRIMITIVE STATESMEN THEREFORE BRADSTREET ENDICOTT DUDLEY BELLINGHAM AND THEIR COMPEERS
IN TOKEN OF ANTIQUE GENTILITY
WHITHER LEADS YONDER FOREST TRACK BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT THOU SAYEST YES BUT ONWARD TOO DEEPER IT GOES AND DEEPER INTO THE WILDERNESS
THAT WILL LEAVE THEE POWERLESS EVEN TO REPENT UP AND AWAY OH HESTER CRIED ARTHUR DIMMESDALE IN WHOSE EYES A FITFUL LIGHT KINDLED BY HER ENTHUSIASM
OF HIS UNSYMPATHIZING THOUGHTS THROUGH WHICH SHE NOW BEHELD HIM HER SPIRIT SANK WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL MUST HAVE BEEN A DELUSION AND THAT VIVIDLY AS SHE HAD DREAMED IT
HESTER I AM MOST MISERABLE THE PEOPLE REVERENCE THEE SAID HESTER AND SURELY THOU WORKEST GOOD AMONG THEM DOTH THIS BRING THEE NO COMFORT
FROM STEPPING FORTH INTO THE PUBLIC WAYS AND WEDGING THEIR
SHONE ON BROAD SHOULDERS AND WELL DEVELOPED BUSTS AND ON ROUND AND RUDDY CHEEKS THAT HAD RIPENED IN THE FAR OFF ISLAND AND HAD HARDLY YET GROWN PALER OR THINNER IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE WAS MOREOVER
COULD CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE SPECTACLE WITHOUT RISKING THE MAJESTY OR REVERENCE OF RANK AND OFFICE IT WAS SAFELY TO BE INFERRED THAT THE INFLICTION OF A LEGAL SENTENCE WOULD HAVE AN EARNEST AND EFFECTUAL MEANING ACCORDINGLY THE CROWD WAS SOMBRE AND GRAVE
WOMAN THOU ART ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS I CANNOT FORGIVE THEE
TO GRASP THE BETTER FORTUNE THAT SEEMED WITHIN HIS REACH HE REPEATED THE WORD ALONE HESTER
BUT YET ATTAINING THE GREAT OBJECT FOR WHICH THE HARMONY OF DRUM AND CLARION ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE MULTITUDE
METHINKS MY SOUL MIGHT KEEP ITSELF ALIVE THEREBY
WITH THE TEARS GUSHING INTO HER EYES WILT THOU DIE FOR VERY WEAKNESS THERE IS NO OTHER CAUSE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD IS ON ME ANSWERED THE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN PRIEST
CLAD IN BURNISHED STEEL AND WITH PLUMAGE NODDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT MORIONS HAD A BRILLIANCY OF EFFECT WHICH NO MODERN DISPLAY CAN ASPIRE TO EQUAL AND YET THE MEN OF CIVIL EMINENCE
IF THOU PREFER TO CROSS THE SEA LEAVE THIS WRECK AND RUIN HERE WHERE IT HATH HAPPENED
NEVER NEVER WHISPERED SHE WHAT WE DID HAD A CONSECRATION OF ITS OWN WE FELT IT SO WE SAID SO TO EACH OTHER HAST THOU FORGOTTEN IT
TO HIDE THY HEART FROM THE GAZE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH YES HESTER BUT ONLY UNDER THE FALLEN LEAVES REPLIED THE MINISTER WITH A SAD SMILE
SHE TURNED HER EYES DOWNWARD AT THE SCARLET LETTER AND EVEN TOUCHED IT WITH HER FINGER TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE INFANT AND THE SHAME WERE REAL YES THESE WERE HER REALITIES
THAT HE KNEW NOT WHETHER IT WERE A WOMAN OR A SHADOW IT MAY BE THAT HIS PATHWAY THROUGH LIFE WAS HAUNTED THUS BY A SPECTRE THAT HAD STOLEN OUT FROM AMONG HIS THOUGHTS HE MADE A STEP NIGHER
HIS WAS THE PROFESSION AT THAT ERA IN WHICH INTELLECTUAL ABILITY DISPLAYED ITSELF FAR MORE THAN IN POLITICAL LIFE FOR LEAVING A HIGHER MOTIVE OUT OF THE QUESTION IT OFFERED
HESTER PRYNNE LOOKED INTO HIS FACE BUT HESITATED TO SPEAK YET UTTERING HIS LONG RESTRAINED EMOTIONS SO VEHEMENTLY AS HE DID HIS WORDS HERE
PHANTASMAGORIC FORMS FROM THE CRUEL WEIGHT AND HARDNESS OF THE REALITY BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY
ON WHOM THE SENTENCE OF A LEGAL TRIBUNAL HAD BUT CONFIRMED THE VERDICT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT BUT IN THAT EARLY SEVERITY OF THE PURITAN CHARACTER AN INFERENCE OF THIS KIND COULD NOT SO INDUBITABLY BE DRAWN
THEY MIGHT LEARN THE SCIENCE AND SO FAR AS PEACEFUL EXERCISE WOULD TEACH THEM THE PRACTICES OF WAR THE HIGH ESTIMATION THEN PLACED UPON THE MILITARY CHARACTER MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE LOFTY PORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE COMPANY
TURNING A CORNER AND MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE MARKET PLACE FIRST CAME THE MUSIC IT COMPRISED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS PERHAPS IMPERFECTLY ADAPTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND PLAYED WITH NO GREAT SKILL
THAT OLD MAN'S REVENGE HAS BEEN BLACKER THAN MY SIN HE HAS VIOLATED IN COLD BLOOD THE SANCTITY OF A HUMAN HEART THOU AND I HESTER NEVER DID SO
THE DOOR OF THE JAIL BEING FLUNG OPEN FROM WITHIN THERE APPEARED IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE A BLACK SHADOW EMERGING INTO SUNSHINE THE GRIM AND GRISTLY PRESENCE OF THE TOWN BEADLE WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND HIS STAFF OF OFFICE IN HIS HAND THIS PERSONAGE
ITS RANKS WERE FILLED WITH GENTLEMEN WHO FELT THE STIRRINGS OF MARTIAL IMPULSE AND SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF COLLEGE OF ARMS WHERE AS IN AN ASSOCIATION OF KNIGHTS TEMPLARS
BY HERSELF SHE HATH GOOD SKILL AT HER NEEDLE THAT'S CERTAIN REMARKED ONE OF HER FEMALE SPECTATORS
OF THE SAME SPHERE WITHOUT A WORD MORE SPOKEN NEITHER HE NOR SHE ASSUMING THE GUIDANCE BUT WITH AN UNEXPRESSED CONSENT THEY GLIDED BACK INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WOODS WHENCE HESTER HAD EMERGED
IS THERE NO VIRTUE IN WOMAN SAVE WHAT SPRINGS FROM A WHOLESOME FEAR OF THE GALLOWS THAT IS THE HARDEST WORD YET HUSH NOW GOSSIPS FOR THE LOCK IS TURNING IN THE PRISON DOOR AND HERE COMES MISTRESS PRYNNE HERSELF
WHOSE SURE REWARD IS DEATH AND DISHONOUR WHEN HIS DREARY WATCH SHALL COME TO AN END
IT IS ALL FALSEHOOD
IT DENOTED THE ADVANCE OF THE PROCESSION OF MAGISTRATES AND CITIZENS ON ITS WAY TOWARDS THE MEETING HOUSE WHERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH A CUSTOM THUS EARLY ESTABLISHED AND EVER SINCE OBSERVED
LONG CONTINUED THOUGHT OR PERCHANCE HIS SENSITIVE TEMPERAMENT WAS INVIGORATED BY THE LOUD AND PIERCING MUSIC THAT SWELLED HEAVEN WARD AND UPLIFTED HIM ON ITS ASCENDING WAVE NEVERTHELESS
WITH SUDDEN AND DESPERATE TENDERNESS SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PRESSED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BOSOM LITTLE CARING THOUGH HIS CHEEK RESTED ON THE SCARLET LETTER
AT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STREET
OR AN IDLE OR VAGRANT INDIAN WHOM THE WHITE MAN'S FIREWATER
WHAT ELSE COULD I LOOK FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND LEADING SUCH A LIFE AS MINE
A NEW LIFE BUT FEEDING ITSELF ON TIME WORN MATERIALS LIKE A TUFT OF GREEN MOSS ON A CRUMBLING WALL LASTLY IN LIEU OF THESE SHIFTING SCENES CAME BACK THE RUDE MARKET PLACE OF THE PURITAN SETTLEMENT WITH ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED
NOT OF THE BODY IT MIGHT BE SPIRITUAL AND IMPARTED TO HIM BY ANGELICAL MINISTRATIONS IT MIGHT BE THE EXHILARATION OF THAT POTENT CORDIAL WHICH IS DISTILLED ONLY IN THE FURNACE GLOW OF EARNEST AND
WOULD SHE COME OFF WITH SUCH A SENTENCE AS THE WORSHIPFUL MAGISTRATES HAVE AWARDED MARRY I TROW NOT PEOPLE SAY SAID ANOTHER THAT THE REVEREND MASTER DIMMESDALE HER GODLY PASTOR TAKES IT VERY GRIEVOUSLY TO HEART THAT SUCH A SCANDAL SHOULD HAVE COME UPON HIS CONGREGATION
AND A SLIGHTER PHYSICAL FRAME IF NOT CHARACTER OF LESS FORCE AND SOLIDITY THAN HER OWN THE WOMEN WHO WERE NOW STANDING ABOUT THE PRISON DOOR STOOD WITHIN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE MAN LIKE ELIZABETH
LIKE A MAN TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN A MOOD TO WHICH HE WAS RELUCTANT TO HAVE WITNESSES THROWING HIS EYES ANXIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE HE INDISTINCTLY BEHELD A FORM UNDER THE TREES
IN FRANCE IN PLEASANT ITALY
OR OTHER DARKSOME APARTMENT OF THE PRISON
THAT WEAR THE SCARLET LETTER OPENLY UPON YOUR BOSOM MINE BURNS IN SECRET THOU LITTLE KNOWEST WHAT A RELIEF IT IS AFTER THE TORMENT OF A SEVEN YEARS CHEAT
SINCE HER HAPPY INFANCY STANDING ON THAT MISERABLE EMINENCE SHE SAW AGAIN HER NATIVE VILLAGE IN OLD ENGLAND AND HER PATERNAL HOME A DECAYED HOUSE OF GREY STONE WITH A POVERTY STRICKEN ASPECT BUT RETAINING A HALF OBLITERATED SHIELD OF ARMS OVER THE PORTAL
AS I WISH AND DESIRE IT YOU WILL HAVE A SWEET LITTLE WIFE ALL GRATITUDE AND DEVOTION EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE WHAT AN AMAZING MATCH FOR HER
I AM NOW PERSUADED SHE IS THE VERY ONE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY YOUR WICKED PROJECT UPON HER PEACE TURNS OUT A CLEVER THOUGHT INDEED YOU WILL BOTH FIND YOUR GOOD IN IT
FANNY'S GRACES OF MANNER AND GOODNESS OF HEART WERE THE EXHAUSTLESS THEME THE GENTLENESS MODESTY AND SWEETNESS OF HER CHARACTER WERE WARMLY EXPATIATED ON
AND HE TOOK HER HAND AND LED HER BACK TO HER SEAT AND WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FARTHER EXPLANATION BEFORE SHE HAD SUSPECTED FOR WHAT SHE WAS DETAINED WHEN SHE DID UNDERSTAND IT HOWEVER
HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE HE WALKED UP WITH DOCTOR GRANT WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED
SHE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT IT WAS TREATING HER IMPROPERLY AND UNWORTHILY AND IN SUCH A WAY AS SHE HAD NOT DESERVED BUT IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF AND ENTIRELY OF A PIECE WITH WHAT SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE
SHE HAD BURST AWAY FROM HIM AND AT THAT MOMENT SIR THOMAS WAS HEARD SPEAKING TO A SERVANT IN HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ROOM THEY WERE IN IT WAS NO TIME FOR FARTHER ASSURANCES OR ENTREATY
BUT HE WAS STILL TALKING ON DESCRIBING HIS AFFECTION SOLICITING A RETURN AND FINALLY IN WORDS SO PLAIN AS TO BEAR BUT ONE MEANING EVEN TO HER OFFERING HIMSELF HAND FORTUNE
HOW VERY KIND OH MISTER CRAWFORD WE ARE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU DEAREST DEAREST WILLIAM SHE JUMPED UP AND MOVED IN HASTE TOWARDS THE DOOR CRYING OUT I WILL GO TO MY UNCLE
YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
BUT GO ON GO ON TELL ME MORE WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS DOES SHE KNOW HER OWN HAPPINESS NO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR
AS IF IT WERE THE BEST BLESSING OF LIFE YOU ARE NOT SENSIBLE OF THE GAIN FOR YOUR REGARD FOR HIM HAS BLINDED YOU BUT IN MY ESTIMATION YOUR MARRYING EARLY MAY BE THE SAVING OF YOU
AND SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO SHEW HALF THE DISPLEASURE SHE FELT BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN CONFERRING AN OBLIGATION WHICH NO WANT OF DELICACY ON HIS PART COULD MAKE A TRIFLE TO HER
YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE HAD BEEN IDLE BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON
INFINITELY OBLIGED ABSOLUTELY ANGRY IT WAS ALL BEYOND BELIEF HE WAS INEXCUSABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT SUCH WERE HIS HABITS THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF EVIL
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND YOUR FATE IN MANSFIELD BUT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN BETTER THERE IS NOT A BETTER GIRL IN THE WORLD AND YOU DO NOT WANT FOR FORTUNE
MISTER RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE NOT A CREATURE
FRIENDLESS NEGLECTED FORGOTTEN NAY HENRY NOT BY ALL NOT FORGOTTEN BY ALL NOT FRIENDLESS OR FORGOTTEN HER COUSIN EDMUND NEVER FORGETS HER
CONTINUALLY EXERCISED HER PATIENCE AND FORBEARANCE HER AFFECTIONS WERE EVIDENTLY STRONG TO SEE HER WITH HER BROTHER WHAT COULD MORE DELIGHTFULLY PROVE THAT THE WARMTH OF HER HEART
BY SUCH VERY LETTERS AS THESE MY UNCLE WHO IS THE VERY BEST MAN IN THE WORLD HAS EXERTED HIMSELF AS I KNEW HE WOULD AFTER SEEING YOUR BROTHER
SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE INDIFFERENT TO MISTER CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
THOUGH TO PART WITH HER AT A MOMENT WHEN HER MODESTY ALONE SEEMED TO HIS SANGUINE AND PREASSURED MIND TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE HAPPINESS HE SOUGHT WAS A CRUEL NECESSITY
I CANNOT ADMIT MISSUS GRANT TO HAVE AN EQUAL CLAIM WITH FANNY AND MYSELF FOR WE SHALL BOTH HAVE A RIGHT IN YOU FANNY WILL BE SO TRULY YOUR SISTER
WHAT WAS INSPIRED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER BEING WELL PRINCIPLED AND RELIGIOUS I COULD SO WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY CONFIDE IN HER SAID HE
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
HENRY OVERJOYED TO HAVE HER GO BOWED AND WATCHED HER OFF AND WITHOUT LOSING ANOTHER MOMENT TURNED INSTANTLY TO FANNY AND TAKING OUT SOME LETTERS SAID
HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO GET OUT OF THE SUBJECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND TURN THE CURRENT OF SIR THOMAS'S IDEAS INTO A HAPPIER CHANNEL SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO INSINUATE IN HER OWN PRAISE
AS IF NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS I COULD NOT GET AWAY SOONER FANNY LOOKED SO LOVELY I AM QUITE DETERMINED MARY MY MIND IS ENTIRELY MADE UP WILL IT ASTONISH YOU NO YOU MUST BE AWARE
I WILL ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK AND NOT HIS SISTER HE COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING
YOUR KINDNESS TO WILLIAM MAKES ME MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS BUT I DO NOT WANT I CANNOT BEAR
YOU WILL DIVIDE YOUR YEAR BETWEEN LONDON AND NORTHAMPTONSHIRE YES THAT'S RIGHT AND IN LONDON OF COURSE A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN NO LONGER WITH THE ADMIRAL MY DEAREST HENRY
BEFORE SIR THOMAS'S POLITENESS OR APOLOGIES WERE OVER OR HE HAD REACHED THE BEGINNING OF THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE WHICH HIS VISITOR CAME TO COMMUNICATE SHE WAS FEELING THINKING TREMBLING ABOUT EVERYTHING
AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MISSUS GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM IT WAS THE FIRST DAY FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY DIVIDED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE
I MUST HAVE THEM LOVE ONE ANOTHER MARY REFRAINED FROM SAYING WHAT SHE FELT THAT THERE COULD NOT BE TWO PERSONS IN EXISTENCE WHOSE CHARACTERS AND MANNERS WERE LESS ACCORDANT
NO NO NO SHE CRIED HIDING HER FACE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE
WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD ROOM AND GIVEN THE SCENE PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON THE SCENE PAINTER WAS GONE HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM
THIS MUST BE MY FIRST FEELING BUT MY SECOND WHICH YOU SHALL HAVE AS SINCERELY IS THAT I APPROVE YOUR CHOICE FROM MY SOUL AND FORESEE YOUR HAPPINESS AS HEARTILY
WHAT COULD BE MORE ENCOURAGING TO A MAN WHO HAD HER LOVE IN VIEW THEN
YOU CANNOT WERE YOU EVEN LESS PLEASING SUPPOSING HER NOT TO LOVE YOU ALREADY OF WHICH HOWEVER I CAN HAVE LITTLE DOUBT YOU WOULD BE SAFE THE GENTLENESS AND GRATITUDE OF HER DISPOSITION
AS TO HIMSELF THOUGH HE HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO RELATE BUT HIS OWN SENSATIONS NOTHING TO DWELL ON BUT FANNY'S CHARMS FANNY'S BEAUTY OF FACE AND FIGURE
AND PREVAILING ON THE ADMIRAL TO EXERT WHATEVER INTEREST HE MIGHT HAVE FOR GETTING HIM ON THIS HAD BEEN HIS BUSINESS HE HAD COMMUNICATED IT TO NO CREATURE HE HAD NOT BREATHED A SYLLABLE OF IT EVEN TO MARY
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
FEEL HIS MOTIVES TO DESERVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS THAT HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL HE WAS ANXIOUS
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
THAT SWEETNESS WHICH MAKES SO ESSENTIAL A PART OF EVERY WOMAN'S WORTH IN THE JUDGMENT OF MAN THAT THOUGH HE SOMETIMES LOVES WHERE IT IS NOT HE CAN NEVER BELIEVE IT ABSENT
TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM SHE GOT UP AND SAID ONLY WITH MUCH AGITATION DON'T MISTER CRAWFORD PRAY DON'T I BEG YOU WOULD NOT THIS IS A SORT OF TALKING WHICH IS VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME
BUT NOW IT WAS A PLEASANT JOKE SUSPECTED ONLY OF CONCEALING SOMETHING PLANNED AS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY DID BRING A SURPRISE TO HER HENRY HAD SAID HE SHOULD JUST GO AND ASK THE BERTRAMS HOW THEY DID AND BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES
AND AT AN EARLIER HOUR THAN COMMON VISITING WARRANTS THE TWO LADIES WERE TOGETHER IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND FORTUNATELY FOR HIM LADY BERTRAM WAS ON THE VERY POINT OF QUITTING IT AS HE ENTERED SHE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR
AND FELICITY WAS ENOUGH SHE TOOK THE LETTERS AS HE GAVE THEM THE FIRST WAS FROM THE ADMIRAL TO INFORM HIS NEPHEW IN A FEW WORDS OF HIS HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THE OBJECT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
EVERY ONE OF US EXCEPTING FANNY FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY THROUGHOUT WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE TO YOU
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
I COULD NAME THREE PEOPLE NOW WHO WOULD GIVE ME MY OWN TERMS AND THANK ME HA CRIED MARY SETTLE IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE THAT IS PLEASANT
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
AND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU CEASED TO LOVE SHE WOULD YET FIND IN YOU THE LIBERALITY AND GOOD BREEDING OF A GENTLEMAN
MARY HAD ONLY TO BE GRATEFUL AND GIVE GENERAL ASSURANCES BUT SHE WAS NOW VERY FULLY PURPOSED TO BE THE GUEST OF NEITHER BROTHER NOR SISTER MANY MONTHS LONGER
AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MISTER WILLIAM PRICE'S COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT OF H M SLOOP THRUSH BEING MADE OUT WAS SPREADING GENERAL JOY THROUGH A WIDE CIRCLE OF GREAT PEOPLE
AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY DEAR SIR THOMAS IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR HORSES OF COURSE
NOT TO FEEL THE WORTH OF GOOD PRINCIPLES IN A WIFE THOUGH HE WAS TOO LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SERIOUS REFLECTION TO KNOW THEM BY THEIR PROPER NAME BUT WHEN HE TALKED OF HER HAVING SUCH A STEADINESS
AND MORE FULLY AND MORE SOLEMNLY THE CONVICTION OF HIS DETERMINATION ONCE ADMITTED IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME THERE WAS EVEN PLEASURE WITH THE SURPRISE
IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND THE ROADS ALMOST IMPASSABLE BUT I DID PERSUADE HER I KNOW HOW GREAT HOW JUSTLY GREAT YOUR INFLUENCE IS WITH LADY BERTRAM AND HER CHILDREN
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
IT QUITE DELIGHTS ME BUT WHAT WILL MISSUS RUSHWORTH AND JULIA SAY I CARE NEITHER WHAT THEY SAY NOR WHAT THEY FEEL THEY WILL NOW SEE WHAT SORT OF WOMAN IT IS THAT CAN ATTACH ME
SHOULD BE PROVED THE PRAISE OF A FRIEND AS THIS DAY DOES PROVE IT NOW I MAY SAY THAT EVEN I COULD NOT REQUIRE WILLIAM PRICE TO EXCITE A GREATER INTEREST OR BE FOLLOWED BY WARMER WISHES AND HIGHER COMMENDATION
HOW IMPATIENT HOW ANXIOUS HOW WILD I HAVE BEEN ON THE SUBJECT I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HOW SEVERELY MORTIFIED HOW CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED IN NOT HAVING IT FINISHED WHILE I WAS IN LONDON
AND TOM HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S PARTICULARITY WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED MISTER YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED
AND FOUND HERSELF EXPECTED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD CREATED SENSATIONS WHICH HIS HEART HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE AND THAT EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE FOR WILLIAM WAS TO BE PLACED TO THE ACCOUNT OF HIS EXCESSIVE
HE HAD ONLY TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH LADY BERTRAM AND FANNY SITTING WITH THEM AN HOUR AND A HALF EXCLAIMED MARY BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF HER SURPRISE YES MARY SAID HE DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HIS AND WALKING ALONG THE SWEEP
BY WHICH IT APPEARED THAT HIS LORDSHIP HAD THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF ATTENDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF SIR CHARLES THAT SIR CHARLES WAS MUCH DELIGHTED IN HAVING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROVING HIS REGARD FOR ADMIRAL CRAWFORD
HAD YOU SEEN HER THIS MORNING MARY HE CONTINUED ATTENDING WITH SUCH INEFFABLE SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE TO ALL THE DEMANDS OF HER AUNT'S STUPIDITY WORKING WITH HER AND FOR HER
HER TEMPER HE HAD GOOD REASON TO DEPEND ON AND TO PRAISE HE HAD OFTEN SEEN IT TRIED WAS THERE ONE OF THE FAMILY EXCEPTING EDMUND WHO HAD NOT IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED HIS NOTICE FROM HER AND THE FAREWELL VISIT AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS A VERY SHORT ONE HE WAS GONE
OF WHAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BEFORE ALL THE WORLD I HAVE NOT LOST A MOMENT HOWEVER THE POST WAS LATE THIS MORNING BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN SINCE A MOMENT'S DELAY
OF THEIR OWN ABOMINABLE NEGLECT AND UNKINDNESS THEY WILL BE ANGRY HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE AND IN A COOLER TONE MISSUS RUSHWORTH WILL BE VERY ANGRY IT WILL BE A BITTER PILL TO HER
CHAPTER THIRTY MISS CRAWFORD'S UNEASINESS WAS MUCH LIGHTENED BY THIS CONVERSATION AND SHE WALKED HOME AGAIN IN SPIRITS WHICH MIGHT HAVE DEFIED ALMOST ANOTHER WEEK
AND THIS IS WHAT TOOK YOU TO LONDON THIS WAS YOUR BUSINESS YOU CHOSE TO CONSULT THE ADMIRAL BEFORE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND BUT THIS HE STOUTLY DENIED
THAT IS LIKE OTHER BITTER PILLS IT WILL HAVE TWO MOMENTS ILL FLAVOUR AND THEN BE SWALLOWED AND FORGOTTEN FOR I AM NOT SUCH A COXCOMB AS TO SUPPOSE HER FEELINGS MORE LASTING THAN OTHER WOMEN'S
IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I AM BEWILDERED DID ADMIRAL CRAWFORD APPLY HOW WAS IT
THE ADMIRAL HAS HIS FAULTS BUT HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN AND HAS BEEN MORE THAN A FATHER TO ME FEW FATHERS WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY HALF SO MUCH YOU MUST NOT PREJUDICE FANNY AGAINST HIM
OFTEN AT THIS HOUR AFTER DUSK HE WOULD ENTER THE SILENT CLOSE AND STAND OPPOSITE THE HOUSE THAT CONTAINED SUE AND WATCH THE SHADOWS OF THE GIRLS HEADS PASSING TO AND FRO UPON THE BLINDS
AND HIS AIMS HAVING BEEN WHAT THEY WERE FOR SO MANY YEARS EVERYTHING THE OTHERS SAID TURNED UPON HIS TONGUE BY A SORT OF MECHANICAL CRAZE TO THE SUBJECT OF SCHOLARSHIP AND STUDY
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
NO IT WASN'T THAT SHE ANSWERED I DID CATCH A BAD COLD BUT I COULD HAVE WRITTEN ONLY I WOULDN'T WHY NOT FRIGHTENING ME LIKE THIS
WHOEVER DID IT WAS WASTEFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY OH THAT'S NOTHING BUT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME I SUPPOSE OH YES IF YOU LIKE TO
ONCE THERE I SHALL SO ADVANCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE I SHALL THERE GET THAT MY PRESENT KNOWLEDGE WILL APPEAR TO ME BUT AS CHILDISH IGNORANCE I MUST SAVE MONEY AND I WILL AND ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES SHALL OPEN ITS DOORS TO ME
IN THIS ROOM THEY WERE LIVING HERE AT THAT TIME WHAT MADE EE ASK THAT
BUT WHATEVER HER MOOD HE COULD NOT SAY SHE WAS WRONG IN HER VIEW HE REPLIED I ACQUIESCE YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS A LESSON IN RENUNCIATION WHICH I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO LEARN AT THIS SEASON JUDE
THINGS SEEM SO DIFFERENT IN THE COLD LIGHT OF MORNING DON'T THEY WHAT MISTER PHILLOTSON WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW IT WAS QUITE BY HIS WISH THAT I WENT THERE HE IS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD FOR WHOM I HAVE ANY RESPECT OR FEAR I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME BUT HE'LL SCOLD ME DREADFULLY I EXPECT
SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE STAGGERED UNDER THE NEWS COULD EAT NO BREAKFAST AND KEPT ON DRINKING TEA BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS SO DRY
ALMOST AS IF SHE LOVED HIM CRUELLY SWEET INDEED SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT MORNING BUT HIS THOUGHTS OF A PENANCE IN STORE FOR HER WERE TEMPERED BY AN ACHE
BY INDIRECT INQUIRIES HE SOON PERCEIVED CLEARLY WHAT HE HAD LONG UNEASILY SUSPECTED THAT TO QUALIFY HIMSELF FOR CERTAIN OPEN SCHOLARSHIPS AND EXHIBITIONS WAS THE ONLY BRILLIANT COURSE BUT TO DO THIS A GOOD DEAL OF COACHING WOULD BE NECESSARY AND MUCH NATURAL ABILITY
THAT WHEN YOU WERE OUT OF SIGHT I FELT WHAT A CRUEL AND UNGRATEFUL WOMAN I WAS TO SAY IT AND IT HAS REPROACHED ME EVER SINCE IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME JUDE YOU MAY I DON'T MIND AT ALL
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER FOR HIM IN EVERY WAY IF HE HAD NEVER COME WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE DELUSIVE PRECINCTS HAD GONE TO SOME BUSY COMMERCIAL TOWN WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF MAKING MONEY BY HIS WITS
TWO MEN IN THEIR FILIGREE AND VELVET FRAMES STANDING TOGETHER BESIDE HER LOOKING GLASS WHO ARE THESE MEN DID SHE EVER SAY ASKED THE MISTRESS STRICTLY SPEAKING RELATIONS PORTRAITS ONLY ARE ALLOWED ON THESE TABLES YOU KNOW ONE
ARE THERE MANY COUPLES DO YOU THINK WHERE ONE DISLIKES THE OTHER FOR NO DEFINITE FAULT YES I SUPPOSE IF EITHER CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON FOR INSTANCE BUT EVEN APART FROM THAT
AND I NEVER SUPPOSED YOU THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS MARRYING ME TILL THE OTHER EVENING WHEN I BEGAN TO FANCY YOU DID LOVE ME A LITTLE PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN SO INTIMATE WITH YOU IT IS ALL MY FAULT EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT ALWAYS
ALL NOW RUTHLESSLY SWEPT AWAY THROW THE VISITOR EVEN AGAINST HIS WILL INTO A PENSIVE MELANCHOLY WHICH THE STIMULATING ATMOSPHERE AND LIMITLESS LANDSCAPE AROUND HIM CAN SCARCELY DISPEL THE SPOT WAS THE BURIAL PLACE OF A KING AND A QUEEN
A HOUSE WHICH HE SOON DISCOVERED FROM HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS ANTIQUITY A GLIMMERING CANDLELIGHT SHONE FROM A FRONT WINDOW THE SHUTTERS BEING YET UNCLOSED HE COULD SEE THE INTERIOR CLEARLY THE FLOOR SINKING A COUPLE OF STEPS BELOW THE ROAD WITHOUT
JUST YOU SHUT UP BOWER O BLISS SAID ONE OF THE UNDERGRADUATES SILENCE
THOUGH IT REALLY WAS FROM THE MASTER IN PERSON IT RAN THUS BIBLIOLL COLLEGE SIR I HAVE READ YOUR LETTER WITH INTEREST AND JUDGING FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION OF YOURSELF AS A WORKING MAN
IN THE EVENING THE FREQUENTERS OF THE HOUSE DROPPED IN ONE BY ONE JUDE STILL RETAINING HIS SEAT IN THE CORNER THOUGH HIS MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HE HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING THE WHOLE DAY EXCEPT A BISCUIT
HE WONDERED IF SHE TALKED OF HIM TO PHILLOTSON THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS IS VERY NICE SHE WENT ON TO KEEP HIM FROM HIS JEALOUS THOUGHTS WHICH SHE READ CLEARLY AS SHE ALWAYS DID INDEED WHEN THEY TALKED ON AN INDIFFERENT SUBJECT AS NOW
HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
WEARY AND MUD BESPATTERED BUT QUITE POSSESSED OF HIS ORDINARY CLEARNESS OF BRAIN HE SAT DOWN BY THE WELL THINKING AS HE DID SO WHAT A POOR CHRIST HE MADE SEEING A TROUGH OF WATER NEAR HE BATHED HIS FACE AND WENT ON TO THE COTTAGE OF HIS GREAT AUNT
WOULD HAVE SHUNNED SUCH ENCOUNTERS IF THEY DOUBTED THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT HE COULD NOT
CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO
IT IS NONE OF THE NATURAL TRAGEDIES OF LOVE THAT'S LOVE'S USUAL TRAGEDY IN CIVILIZED LIFE BUT A TRAGEDY ARTIFICIALLY MANUFACTURED FOR PEOPLE WHO IN A NATURAL STATE WOULD FIND RELIEF IN PARTING
THREE YOUNG WOMEN WERE KNEELING WITH BUCKETS AND PLATTERS BESIDE THEM CONTAINING HEAPS OF PIGS CHITTERLINGS WHICH THEY WERE WASHING IN THE RUNNING WATER
YE'VE GOT THERE RIGHT ENOUGH THEN JUDE SHOWED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY TO THE SEAT OF L'ARNING THE CITY OF LIGHT YOU USED TO TALK TO US ABOUT AS A LITTLE BOY
THE EXTENT OF HIS OWN LEARNING BEING DWELT UPON WITH AN INSISTENCE THAT WOULD HAVE APPEARED PITIABLE TO HIMSELF IN HIS SANE HOURS I DON'T CARE A DAMN HE WAS SAYING FOR ANY PROVOST WARDEN PRINCIPAL FELLOW OR CURSED MASTER OF ARTS IN THE UNIVERSITY
AND AGAIN QUESTIONED HIS DEVOTIONAL MOTTO THAT ALL WAS FOR THE BEST HE RETIRED TO REST EARLY BUT HIS SLEEP WAS FITFUL FROM THE SENSE THAT SUE WAS SO NEAR AT HAND
THE APPEARANCE OF ACHILLES UNARMED AND HIS HEAVENLY ARMOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE FUNERAL GAMES IN THE TWENTY THIRD
SUE WAS SILENT IS IT WRONG JUDE SHE SAID WITH A TENTATIVE TREMOR FOR A HUSBAND OR WIFE TO TELL A THIRD PERSON THAT THEY ARE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE IF A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS A RELIGIOUS THING IT IS POSSIBLY WRONG
WHERE I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED YES INDEED SHE EXCLAIMED WITH CURIOSITY HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO GO IN AND SEE WHAT THE SPOT IS LIKE WHERE I AM SO SOON TO KNEEL AND DO IT AGAIN HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HE SOFTLY WENT NEARER TO HER AND OBSERVED THAT A WARM FLUSH NOW ROSED HER HITHERTO BLUE CHEEKS AND FELT THAT HER HANGING HAND WAS NO LONGER COLD
TO BEGUILE HIS LONELY WALKS BY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS THEREIN I HAVE READ TWO BOOKS OF THE ILIAD BESIDES BEING PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE SPEECH OF PHOENIX IN THE NINTH BOOK THE FIGHT OF HECTOR AND AJAX IN THE FOURTEENTH
OR WAS SUE SIMPLY SO PERVERSE THAT SHE WILFULLY GAVE HERSELF AND HIM PAIN FOR THE ODD AND MOURNFUL LUXURY OF PRACTISING LONG SUFFERING IN HER OWN PERSON AND OF BEING TOUCHED WITH TENDER PITY FOR HIM AT HAVING MADE HIM PRACTISE IT HE COULD PERCEIVE THAT HER FACE WAS NERVOUSLY SET
MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
THINK NO MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP OF SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN HE KNEW HER MOOD THE LOOK OF HER FACE WHEN SHE SUBSCRIBED HERSELF AT LENGTH THUS
IT IS QUITE LIKE THE GENUINE ARTICLE ALL CUT UP INTO VERSES TOO SO THAT IT IS LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER EVANGELISTS READ IN A DREAM WHEN THINGS ARE THE SAME YET NOT THE SAME
WHO HAD MADE THE SAME STATEMENT IN ORDER TO GAIN MEETINGS WITH HER LOVER THE AFFAIR HAD CREATED A SCANDAL AND THE MANAGEMENT HAD CONSEQUENTLY BEEN ROUGH ON COUSINS EVER SINCE
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING TWO THINGS HE SAID HURRIEDLY AS THE TRAIN CAME UP ONE IS A WARM ONE THE OTHER A COLD ONE JUDE SHE SAID I KNOW ONE OF THEM AND YOU MUSTN'T WHAT YOU MUSTN'T LOVE ME
SHE BROUGHT AS BY MAGIC UPON ITS SMOOTH AND ROTUND SURFACE A PERFECT DIMPLE WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THERE AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE THIS PRODUCTION OF DIMPLES AT WILL
HAVING PROMISED TO CALL AT A FLOUR MILL NEAR CRESSCOMBE TO EXECUTE A COMMISSION FOR HIS AUNT HE WAS IN AN ENTHUSIASTIC MOOD HE SEEMED TO SEE HIS WAY TO LIVING COMFORTABLY IN CHRISTMINSTER IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO AND KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF ONE OF THOSE STRONGHOLDS OF LEARNING
A SET OF BOOKS WHICH HE HAD PURCHASED OF A SECOND HAND DEALER AT A PRICE THAT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE ONE OF MIRACULOUS CHEAPNESS FOR THAT INVALUABLE WORK HE FANCIED HE HEARD SOMETHING RATTLE LIGHTLY AGAINST HIS WINDOW
I KNOW YOU WITH YOUR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES THINK THAT A MARRIED WOMAN IN TROUBLE OF A KIND LIKE MINE COMMITS A MORTAL SIN IN MAKING A MAN THE CONFIDANT OF IT AS I DID YOU I WISH I HADN'T NOW DON'T WISH IT DEAR HE SAID
HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
THOUGH SHE DID NOT LOOK PALE OR ILL PHILLOTSON CAME FREQUENTLY BUT MOSTLY WHEN JUDE WAS ABSENT ON THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING WHEN JUDE HAD GIVEN HIMSELF A HOLIDAY SUE AND HER COUSIN HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME DURING THIS CURIOUS INTERVAL
OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
NONE OF THEM COMING OUT TO GREET HER OR TO MAKE INQUIRY WHEN THEY HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS THEY FOUND THAT SHE DID NOT FOLLOW THEM INTO THE DINING HALL TO BREAKFAST AND THEY THEN LEARNT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEVERELY REPRIMANDED AND ORDERED TO A SOLITARY ROOM FOR A WEEK THERE TO BE CONFINED AND TAKE HER MEALS
MOURNFULLY YET STURDILY THOSE BUILDINGS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND PRIVILEGES WERE NOT FOR HIM FROM THE LOOMING ROOF OF THE GREAT LIBRARY INTO WHICH HE HARDLY EVER HAD TIME TO ENTER HIS GAZE TRAVELLED ON TO THE VARIED SPIRES
WHICH INCLUDED THE DAUGHTERS OF MECHANICS CURATES SURGEONS SHOPKEEPERS FARMERS DAIRY MEN SOLDIERS SAILORS AND VILLAGERS THEY SAT IN THE LARGE SCHOOL ROOM OF THE ESTABLISHMENT ON THE EVENING PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED
BUT THE FIRST PERSON THEY ENCOUNTERED ON ENTERING THE MAIN STREET WAS THE SCHOOLMASTER HIMSELF WHOSE TRAIN HAD ARRIVED SOONER THAN SUE EXPECTED THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY TO DEMUR TO IN HER LEANING ON JUDE'S ARM BUT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND JUDE THOUGHT THAT PHILLOTSON HAD LOOKED SURPRISED
IT IS SO GOOD OF HIM BECAUSE THE AWKWARDNESS OF MY SITUATION HAS REALLY COME ABOUT BY MY FAULT IN GETTING EXPELLED WISH ME JOY REMEMBER I SAY YOU ARE TO AND YOU MUSTN'T REFUSE YOUR AFFECTIONATE COUSIN
UNWILLING TO ENTER TILL THE CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED HE REMAINED HERE TILL YOUNG VOICES COULD BE HEARD IN THE OPEN AIR AND GIRLS IN WHITE PINAFORES OVER RED AND BLUE FROCKS APPEARED DANCING ALONG THE PATHS
I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT THE YOUNG MAN BRIDEHEAD STAYED OUT WITH WAS NOT HER COUSIN FOR THE VERY GOOD REASON THAT SHE HAS NO SUCH RELATIVE WE HAVE WRITTEN TO CHRISTMINSTER TO ASCERTAIN WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE HER WORD SAID THE HEAD GIRL
AT FOURWAYS MEN HAD STOOD AND TALKED OF NAPOLEON
ALL ALONE WITH ABERRANT PASSIONS AND UNACCOUNTABLE ANTIPATHIES NOW YOU MUSTN'T WAIT LONGER OR YOU WILL LOSE THE COACH COME AND SEE ME AGAIN YOU MUST COME TO THE HOUSE THEN YES SAID JUDE WHEN SHALL IT BE
VISIBILIUM OMNIUM ET INVISIBILIUM
THE NATURAL PICTURESQUENESS AND SINGULARITY OF THE TOWN STILL REMAIN BUT STRANGE TO SAY THESE QUALITIES
AND CROSSED THE HOLLOW FIELD TO THE VERGE OF THE UPLAND BY THE BROWN HOUSE WHERE HE STOOD AND LOOKED OVER THE VAST PROSPECT NORTHWARDS AND OVER THE NEARER LANDSCAPE IN WHICH ALFREDSTON STOOD
NO NO DON'T LET HER KNOW FOR GOD'S SAKE
AS FOR THE SAKE OF ROOM THEN SUE WROTE TO TELL HIM THE DAY FIXED FOR THE WEDDING AND JUDE DECIDED AFTER INQUIRY THAT SHE SHOULD COME INTO RESIDENCE ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY WHICH WOULD ALLOW OF A TEN DAYS STAY IN THE CITY PRIOR TO THE CEREMONY
ON REACHING THE LANDING A VOICE TOLD HIM WHICH WAY TO TURN THE VOICE OF SUE CALLING HIS NAME HE PASSED THE DOORWAY AND FOUND HER LYING IN A LITTLE BED IN A ROOM A DOZEN FEET SQUARE OH SUE HE CRIED SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER AND TAKING HER HAND HOW IS THIS YOU COULDN'T WRITE
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ANY LONGER JUDE SHE SAID THE TRAGIC CONTRALTO NOTE HAVING COME BACK AS OF OLD IT IS GETTING TOO DARK TO STAY TOGETHER LIKE THIS AFTER PLAYING MORBID GOOD FRIDAY TUNES THAT MAKE ONE FEEL WHAT ONE SHOULDN'T WE MUSTN'T SIT AND TALK IN THIS WAY ANY MORE
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE TRYING ORDEAL OF JUDE GIVING HER TO PHILLOTSON SHE COULD HARDLY COMMAND HERSELF RATHER HOWEVER AS IT SEEMED FROM HER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HER COUSIN MUST FEEL WHOM SHE NEED NOT HAVE HAD THERE AT ALL THAN FROM SELF CONSIDERATION
THEN PRESENTLY HE WENT BACK TO HIS WORK AND LAUGHED THE USUAL BITTER LAUGH OF A MAN SO CONFRONTED EVERYTHING SEEMED TURNING TO SATIRE AND YET WHAT COULD THE POOR GIRL DO HE ASKED HIMSELF AND FELT WORSE THAN SHEDDING TEARS
SUE I SOMETIMES THINK YOU ARE A FLIRT SAID HE ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE TILL SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW BY THE KETTLE FLAME THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED
AND HAD TAKEN BREAKFAST APART WHAT OPPRESSED JUDE WAS THE THOUGHT THAT HAVING DONE A WRONG THING OF THIS SORT HIMSELF HE WAS AIDING AND ABETTING THE WOMAN HE LOVED IN DOING A LIKE WRONG THING INSTEAD OF IMPLORING AND WARNING HER AGAINST IT IT WAS ON HIS TONGUE TO SAY
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
OH POOR SUE I DON'T THINK OF YOU LIKE THAT MEANS IT DID JUST OCCUR TO ME TO REGARD YOU IN THE WAY THEY THINK I DO BUT I HADN'T BEGUN TO I HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT THE COUSINSHIP WAS MERELY NOMINAL SINCE WE MET AS TOTAL STRANGERS BUT MY MARRYING YOU DEAR JUDE
THERE CAME TO DISTURB HIS CALM HIS HOPELESS RELATIONS WITH SUE THAT THE ONE AFFINED SOUL HE HAD EVER MET WAS LOST TO HIM THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE RETURNED UPON HIM WITH CRUEL PERSISTENCY TILL UNABLE TO BEAR IT LONGER
BUT DON'T YOU THINK I DESERVE A LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR CONCEALING MY WRONG VERY WRONG SENTIMENTS SINCE I COULDN'T HELP HAVING THEM SHE TURNED HER EYES DOUBTFULLY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN LOOKED AWAY AS IF AFRAID SHE MIGHT FORGIVE HIM
THERE WAS A SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT AND THE RAVEN HOW DURING THE DELIVERY SHE WOULD KNIT HER LITTLE BROWS AND GLARE ROUND TRAGICALLY AND SAY TO THE EMPTY AIR AS IF SOME REAL CREATURE STOOD THERE
BUT HE RECEIVED NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS SOLICITUDE HE SENT ANOTHER NOTE SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER A VISIT SOME SUNDAY THE DISTANCE BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN MILES HE EXPECTED A REPLY ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER DESPATCHING HIS MISSIVE BUT NONE CAME
AND UNFORESEEING HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE APPEARANCE OF THE AFTERNOON ON WHICH HE AWOKE FROM HIS DREAM NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF HE WENT UP TO AN OCTAGONAL CHAMBER IN THE LANTERN OF A SINGULARLY BUILT THEATRE
AND THE COUPLE WERE JUDGED TO BE SOME RELATIONS OF HIS FROM A DISTANCE NOBODY SUPPOSING SUE TO HAVE BEEN A RECENT PUPIL AT THE TRAINING SCHOOL IN THE CARRIAGE JUDE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET HIS EXTRA LITTLE WEDDING PRESENT WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE TWO OR THREE YARDS OF WHITE TULLE
DEAR SUE HE SAID YOU MUST TAKE OFF ALL YOUR THINGS AND LET ME SEE
SPRINGING TO HER FEET SHE SAID BRING BACK WHAT IS LYING THERE JUDE WAS NOW AWARE THAT NO MESSAGE ON ANY MATTER CONNECTED WITH HER FATHER'S BUSINESS HAD PROMPTED HER SIGNAL TO HIM HE SET DOWN HIS BASKET OF TOOLS
LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS THOUGH THE FUTURE WERE THROWN THEREON BY A MAGIC LANTERN ON A SUDDEN SOMETHING SMACKED HIM SHARPLY IN THE EAR AND HE BECAME AWARE THAT A SOFT COLD SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN FLUNG AT HIM
HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE TOLERABLE TO HIS CRUSTY MAIDEN AUNT BY ASSISTING HER TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY AND THE BUSINESS OF THE LITTLE COTTAGE BAKERY HAD GROWN IN CONSEQUENCE
BUT HE HAD SEEN HER AND SAT WITH HER SUCH INTERCOURSE AS THAT WOULD HAVE TO CONTENT HIM FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE THE LESSON OF RENUNCIATION IT WAS NECESSARY AND PROPER THAT HE AS A PARISH PRIEST SHOULD LEARN
IT IS HORRIBLE HOW WE ARE CIRCUMSTANCED SUE HORRIBLE HE SAID ABRUPTLY WITH HIS EYES BENT TO THE FLOOR NO WHY I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY PART OF THE GLOOM YOUR PART IS THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED HIM
WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION FOR SHE BEGAN A COMMENTARY ON PAST YEARS INTRODUCING SUE BRIDEHEAD AS A CHARACTER IN HER RECOLLECTIONS SHE DESCRIBED WHAT AN ODD LITTLE MAID SUE HAD BEEN WHEN A PUPIL AT THE VILLAGE SCHOOL
A CLOCK STRUCK HALF PAST SEVEN AND HE RETURNED SITTING IN HIS ONLY ARM CHAIR HE SAW A SLIM AND FRAGILE BEING MASQUERADING AS HIMSELF ON A SUNDAY SO PATHETIC IN HER DEFENCELESSNESS THAT HIS HEART FELT BIG WITH THE SENSE OF IT ON TWO OTHER CHAIRS BEFORE THE FIRE WERE HER WET GARMENTS
IF HE HAD BEEN A WOMAN HE MUST HAVE SCREAMED UNDER THE NERVOUS TENSION WHICH HE WAS NOW UNDERGOING BUT THAT RELIEF BEING DENIED TO HIS VIRILITY HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH IN MISERY BRINGING LINES ABOUT HIS MOUTH LIKE THOSE IN THE LAOCOON
IF YOU KNEW THE HARP YOU MIGHT DO ALL THAT I AM VERY SURE BUT YOU SING AS WELL AS PLAY YES I REALLY BELIEVE YOU MIGHT EVEN WITHOUT THE HARP STIPULATE FOR WHAT YOU CHOSE AND YOU MUST AND SHALL BE DELIGHTFULLY HONOURABLY AND COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE THE CAMPBELLS OR I HAVE ANY REST
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
HE LOOKED AT HER AS IF WANTING TO READ HER THOUGHTS SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
SUCH A DELIGHTFUL EVENING AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERY BODY SO HAPPY AND SHE AND HER PARTNER THE HAPPIEST I SAID IT WOULD BE SO WAS THE ONLY CONSOLATION HER FATHER'S FEELINGS WERE QUITE DISTINCT
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
AND FORLORN MUST BE THE SINKING FROM IT INTO THE COMMON COURSE OF HARTFIELD DAYS TO COMPLETE EVERY OTHER RECOMMENDATION HE HAD ALMOST TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER WHAT STRENGTH OR WHAT CONSTANCY OF AFFECTION HE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO WAS ANOTHER POINT
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
MISSUS WESTON ADDED THAT HE COULD ONLY ALLOW HIMSELF TIME TO HURRY TO HIGHBURY
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING BACK PRODIGIES MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE AND VERY DESERVEDLY FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD
YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE
A SITUATION SUCH AS YOU DESERVE AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD REQUIRE FOR YOU IS NO EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE IS NOT OBTAINED AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE INDEED INDEED WE MUST BEGIN INQUIRING DIRECTLY EXCUSE ME MA'AM BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS MY INTENTION
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
BUT I WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME LOOKING OVER WILLIAM LARKINS'S WEEK'S ACCOUNT MUCH RATHER I CONFESS
EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
NOT FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE EVEN FOR YOUR FRIENDS MISS FAIRFAX AND MISS BATES HOW UNLUCKY
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
AND WHEN ROUSING HIMSELF IT WAS ONLY TO SAY OF ALL HORRID THINGS LEAVE TAKING IS THE WORST BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN SAID EMMA THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY VISIT TO RANDALLS AH SHAKING HIS HEAD
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE SIR AT ANY TIME SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY LAUGHING
NOT AT ALL SIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND SO MILD THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
HOW CAN EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY THING TO LEARN HERSELF WHILE HARRIET IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL INFERIORITY AND AS FOR HARRIET I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SHE CANNOT GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING TILL MISTER WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE OF OBJECT AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER TO JANE
OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
COULD HE BY A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN BACK HIS WIFE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE BUT HIS COMING WOULD PROBABLY PROLONG RATHER THAN BREAK UP THE PARTY JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT THEN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED TIME
WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS
AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
TO BE THE INTIMATES OF A GIRL WHO WANTED ONLY A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE AND ELEGANCE TO BE QUITE PERFECT SHE WOULD NOTICE HER SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED AND VERY UNFIT
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY OF MISSUS CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED AND AS FOR THE BALL IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU PAPA
BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD A SOMETHING BETWEEN THE DO NOTHING AND THE DO ALL IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MISTER WESTON'S VISITS HERE AND GIVEN MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS AND SMOOTHED MANY LITTLE MATTERS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER
POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE
THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN I MAY BE ABLE TO RETURN
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION
SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
DO NOT WE RATHER SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS I AM SURE WE DO I AM SURE YOU DID NOT MUCH EXPECT TO LIKE US YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN COMING IF YOU HAD HAD A PLEASANT IDEA OF HIGHBURY HE LAUGHED RATHER CONSCIOUSLY AND THOUGH DENYING THE SENTIMENT
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
MISSUS ELTON LEFT THEM NO CHOICE IF JANE REPRESSED HER FOR A LITTLE TIME SHE SOON BEGAN AGAIN AND THOUGH MUCH THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM WAS IN A HALF WHISPER ESPECIALLY ON MISSUS ELTON'S SIDE THERE WAS NO AVOIDING A KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS
THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD I KNOW AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE MY DEAR INDEED SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE WITH A SIGH I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE
WHEN THE LADIES RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER EMMA FOUND IT HARDLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THEIR MAKING TWO DISTINCT PARTIES WITH SO MUCH PERSEVERANCE IN JUDGING AND BEHAVING ILL DID MISSUS ELTON ENGROSS JANE FAIRFAX AND SLIGHT HERSELF
I SHALL ONLY JUST MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE OTHERS IN A COMMON WAY MISSUS WESTON WAS MOST COMFORTABLY PLEASED ON THE OCCASION HER LOOKS AND WORDS HAD NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
WHICH THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MISSUS WESTON HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM HE GAVE HER A LETTER IT WAS FROM FRANK AND TO HERSELF HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT
HALF AN HOUR LATER CHAIRMAN HAYDOCK MOVED A VOTE OF THANKS TO MISTER BLAUSSER THE BOOSTERS CAMPAIGN WAS ON THE TOWN SOUGHT THAT EFFICIENT AND MODERN VARIETY OF FAME WHICH IS KNOWN AS PUBLICITY
USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
AS THE TRAIN STRUCK IN AMONG THE HILLS SHE RESOLVED I'M GOING TO LOVE THE FINE WILL KENNICOTT QUALITY THAT THERE IS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE THE NOBILITY OF GOOD SENSE IT WILL BE SWEET TO SEE VIDA AND GUY AND THE CLARKS
THE TOWN SHABBY AND EGOMANIAC SHE COULD NOT ENDURE SHE COULD NURSE CHAMP PERRY AND WARM TO THE NEIGHBORLINESS OF SAM CLARK BUT SHE COULD NOT SIT APPLAUDING HONEST JIM BLAUSSER
FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
THE HOUSE REEKED WITH A COLORLESS STILLNESS FROM THE WINDOW SHE HEARD KENNICOTT GREETING THE WIDOW BOGART AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE ALWAYS EVERY SNOWY EVENING GUESS THIS LL KEEP UP ALL NIGHT SHE WAITED THERE THEY WERE
RINGING TO THE SKATES ON SHORE THE ICE TIPPED REEDS CLATTERED IN THE WIND AND OAK TWIGS WITH STUBBORN LAST LEAVES HUNG AGAINST A MILKY SKY HARRY HAYDOCK DID FIGURE EIGHTS AND CAROL WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT LIFE
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE
YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SHALL PLEASE TRY THIS CHAIR SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE RUSTY OFFICE GAUNT STOVE SHELVES OF TAN LAW BOOKS DESK CHAIR FILLED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO LONG SAT UPON
WITH SAM CLARK KENNICOTT AND CAROL PRESENT THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THOSE FELLOWS
AND MISTER STOWBODY A CAPITALIST BUT YOU BUSINESS MEN ARE GOING TO BEAT ALL THE REST OF US AT IT WITH YOUR SIMPLE HEARTED ENERGETIC POMPOUS SHE GOT SO FAR ONLY BECAUSE KENNICOTT WAS SLOW IN SHAKING OFF RESPECT FOR HER NOW HE BAYED
NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED
WERE SEEN PERILOUSLY STAGGERING UP LADDERS CARRYING STORM WINDOWS AND SCREWING THEM TO SECOND STORY JAMBS WHILE KENNICOTT PUT UP HIS WINDOWS CAROL DANCED INSIDE THE BEDROOMS AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO SWALLOW THE SCREWS
THE TOWNSMEN INVITED THEMSELVES TO THE FEAST MILLERS REAL ESTATE MEN LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND DOCTOR WILL KENNICOTT THEY BOUGHT LAND AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOLD IT NEXT DAY AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND BOUGHT AGAIN
THE FURNACE SOUNDS UNALTERABLE ETERNAL REMOVING ASHES SHOVELING COAL YES SHE WAS BACK HOME NOTHING HAD CHANGED SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AWAY CALIFORNIA HAD SHE SEEN IT
HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
THAT THEY WERE IN HOLES AND SMUDGED TO GRAYNESS THERE WERE ONLY TWO THINGS WHICH SUGGESTED GUY POLLOCK ON THE GREEN FELT OF THE TABLE DESK BETWEEN LEGAL BLANKS AND A CLOTTED INKWELL
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
SHE ROSE TO A RADIANCE OF SUN ON SNOW SNUG IN HER FURS SHE TROTTED UP TOWN FROSTED SHINGLES SMOKED AGAINST A SKY COLORED LIKE FLAX BLOSSOMS SLEIGH BELLS CLINKED SHOUTS OF GREETING WERE LOUD IN THE THIN BRIGHT AIR
SHE SPOKE ILL OF HIM AT HOME AND IN PUBLIC PLACES BUT KENNICOTT AND THE OTHER POWERS INSISTED MAYBE HE IS KIND OF A ROUGHNECK
SHE COULD NOT FEEL THAT HIS COMING MUCH MATTERED AND A YEAR AFTER WHEN HE FAILED SHE COULD NOT BE VERY SORROWFUL
I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW I'VE SEEN EM I'VE DONE EUROPE FROM SOUP TO NUTS THEY CAN'T SPRING THAT STUFF ON JIM BLAUSSER AND GET AWAY WITH IT AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY LIVE THING IN EUROPE IS OUR BOYS THAT ARE FIGHTING THERE NOW LONDON
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED
THE AFTERNOON GREW OLD AND DARK AUNT BESSIE WENT HOME CAROL TOOK THE BABY INTO HER OWN ROOM THE MAID CAME IN COMPLAINING I CAN'T GET NO EXTRA MILK TO MAKE CHIPPED BEEF FOR SUPPER
DRENCHED CIGAR ASHES GRADUALLY FILLING THE SAUCERS OF COFFEE CUPS AND ORATORICAL REFERENCES TO PEP PUNCH GO VIGOR ENTERPRISE RED BLOOD HE MEN FAIR WOMEN GOD'S COUNTRY JAMES J HILL
AND RAYMIE SURELY THIS WAS NOT RAYMIE BUT A STERNER BROTHER OF HIS THIS MAN WITH THE TIGHT BLOUSE THE SHOULDER EMBLEMS THE TRIM LEGS IN BOOTS HIS FACE SEEMED DIFFERENT HIS LIPS MORE TIGHT HE WAS NOT RAYMIE
SHE SAW A PENCIL MARK ON A WINDOW SILL SHE HAD MADE IT ON A SEPTEMBER DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING A PICNIC FOR FERN MULLINS AND ERIK FERN AND SHE HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL WITH NONSENSE HAD INVENTED MAD PARTIES FOR ALL THE COMING WINTER
THE BAND WAS REORGANIZED AND PROVIDED BY THE COMMERCIAL CLUB WITH UNIFORMS OF PURPLE AND GOLD THE AMATEUR BASEBALL TEAM HIRED A SEMI PROFESSIONAL PITCHER FROM DES MOINES
AND FOUND THE COARSE TOBACCO STAINED UNIMAGINATIVE OLD MAN LYING ON THE SNOW OF THE GRAVE HIS THICK ARMS SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE RAW MOUND AS IF TO PROTECT HER FROM THE COLD HER
IT HURTS ME IN YOU IT'S LIKE BLOOD ON THE WING OF A HUMMING BIRD I'M NOT A HUMMING BIRD I'M A HAWK A TINY LEASHED HAWK PECKED TO DEATH BY THESE LARGE WHITE FLABBY WORMY HENS BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR CONFIRMING ME IN THE FAITH
HE SAW HER WHY HELLO OLD LADY PRETTY DARN GOOD TO BE BACK EH YES SHE LIED WHILE SHE QUAKED NOT NOW I CAN'T FACE THE JOB OF EXPLAINING NOW HE'S BEEN SO GOOD HE TRUSTS ME
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
WITH ORANGE CURTAINS AND POTS OF MIGNONETTE MARBLE HOUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE WITH BUTLERS AND LIMOUSINES AND MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE FICTIONAL EXPLORERS AND AVIATORS HER DAYS WERE SWIFT AND SHE KNEW THAT IN HER FOLLY OF RUNNING AWAY
THE DIAGNOSIS OF MY VILLAGE VIRUS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH I WAS BORN IN AN OHIO TOWN ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE AND MUCH LESS FRIENDLY IT'D HAD MORE GENERATIONS IN WHICH TO FORM AN OLIGARCHY OF RESPECTABILITY
KENNICOTT DISCUSSED LAND PRICES WITH THEM HE WENT INTO THE MERITS OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF MOTOR CARS WITH THEM HE WAS INTIMATE WITH TRAIN PORTERS AND HE INSISTED ON SEEING THE LUKE DAWSONS AT THEIR FLIMSY BUNGALOW IN PASADENA
IT WAS SO RICH LOOKING TO SIT AND DRIVE AND SO EASY SKIING AND SLIDING WERE STUPID AND OLD FASHIONED IN FACT THE VILLAGE LONGED FOR THE ELEGANCE OF CITY RECREATIONS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE CITIES LONGED FOR VILLAGE SPORTS
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THE FARMERS HE IS ORGANIZING WILL DEPRIVE YOU TOWNSMEN OF THE MONEY YOU MAKE OUT OF MORTGAGES AND WHEAT AND SHOPS OF COURSE SINCE WE'RE AT WAR WITH GERMANY ANYTHING THAT ANY ONE OF US DOESN'T LIKE IS PRO GERMAN
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS TABLE DESK FINGERING THE STARRY ENAMELED VASE SHE COULD NOT COMMENT SHE PICTURED HERSELF RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM TO PAT HIS HAIR SHE SAW THAT HIS LIPS WERE FIRM UNDER HIS SOFT FADED MUSTACHE
TOO DAMNED WET TO PAINT SIT DOWN AND TALK AND SO FOR TEN MINUTES SHE LIVED IN A ROMANTIC NOVEL HER ONLY STRUGGLE WAS IN COAXING KENNICOTT NOT TO SPEND ALL HIS TIME WITH THE TOURISTS FROM THE TEN THOUSAND OTHER GOPHER PRAIRIES
THAT HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE WATCHING SOME ONE BACK IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BINS HE WAS SEEN SLIPPING THROUGH ALLEYS TALKING TO HIMSELF TRYING TO AVOID OBSERVATION CREEPING AT LAST TO THE CEMETERY ONCE CAROL FOLLOWED HIM
I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO SETTLE DOWN AND BE SATISFIED AND NOT DOES HE LIKE CARROTS YET REPLIED CAROL SHE WAS CHEERFUL AS THE SNOW BEGAN TO CONCEAL THE SLATTERNLY YARDS
WHICH INCLUDED SEVEN DISTINCT AND PROVEN SCANDALS ABOUT MISSUS SWIFTWAITE AND ONE CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AS TO THE CHASTITY OF CY BOGART THEY SAW THE FORD SEDAN MAKING ITS WAY OVER THE WATER LINED ICE THROUGH THE SNOW STORM
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
CANVAS JACKETS LINED WITH FLUFFY YELLOW WOOL LIKE THE PLUMAGE OF DUCKLINGS MOCCASINS RED FLANNEL WRISTLETS FOR THE BLAZING CHAPPED WRISTS OF BOYS THESE PROTECTIONS AGAINST WINTER WERE BUSILY DUG OUT OF MOTH BALL SPRINKLED DRAWERS
KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
WITH SPURIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE SAID SPLENDID I WILL FROM THE DOOR HE GLANCED AT HER CURLED IN THE PEELED LEATHER CHAIR HE SLIPPED OUT CAME BACK WITH DOCTOR AND MISSUS DILLON
KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
BUT ALSO THE PERFECT SITE FOR FACTORIES SUMMER COTTAGES AND STATE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS MISTER JAMES BLAUSSER WHO HAD RECENTLY COME TO TOWN TO SPECULATE IN LAND MISTER BLAUSSER WAS KNOWN AS A HUSTLER
CAROL WAITED FOR HIM IN THE STATION AMONG HUDDLED GERMAN WOMEN WITH SHAWLS AND UMBRELLAS AND RAGGED BEARDED FARMERS IN CORDUROY COATS PEASANTS MUTE AS OXEN IN A ROOM THICK WITH THE STEAM OF WET COATS THE REEK OF THE RED HOT STOVE
MOST OF HER RED CROSS WORK RAY STILL NEEDED NURSING SHE EXPLAINED WHEN CAROL SAW HIM WITH HIS UNIFORM OFF IN A PEPPER AND SALT SUIT AND A NEW GRAY FELT HAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED HE WAS NOT MAJOR WUTHERSPOON HE WAS RAYMIE
CHUCKED HIM IN THE RIBS AND SAID SAY BOY
THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS EVEN RIGHT HERE IN THIS FAIR STATE FAIREST AND RICHEST OF ALL THE GLORIOUS UNION THAT STAND UP ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND CLAIM THAT THE EAST AND EUROPE PUT IT ALL OVER THE GOLDEN NORTHWESTLAND NOW LET ME NAIL THAT LIE RIGHT HERE AND NOW
THE WHEAT MONEY DID NOT REMAIN IN THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS THE TOWNS EXISTED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT IOWA FARMERS WERE SELLING THEIR LAND AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE AND COMING INTO MINNESOTA BUT WHOEVER BOUGHT OR SOLD OR MORTGAGED
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN
HUGH WEPT WITH HER WAIT FOR MUMMY A SECOND SHE HASTENED DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO KENNICOTT HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE FURNACE
HAD SHE FOR ONE MINUTE LEFT THIS SCRAPING SOUND OF THE SMALL SHOVEL IN THE ASH PIT OF THE FURNACE BUT KENNICOTT PREPOSTEROUSLY SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD SHE BEEN QUITE SO FAR FROM GOING AWAY AS NOW WHEN HE BELIEVED SHE HAD JUST COME BACK
TO THE HALF DOZEN BRANCH STORES WHICH HE WAS ESTABLISHING AT CROSSROADS HAMLETS HARRY WOULD BE THE TOWN'S RICH MAN IN THE COMING GENERATION AND MAJOR WUTHERSPOON WOULD RISE WITH HIM AND VIDA WAS JUBILANT THOUGH SHE WAS REGRETFUL AT HAVING TO GIVE UP
AND TAR BAGS IN CLOSETS AND ALL OVER TOWN SMALL BOYS WERE SQUEALING OH THERE'S MY MITTENS OR LOOK AT MY SHOE PACKS THERE IS SO SHARP A DIVISION BETWEEN THE PANTING SUMMER AND THE STINGING WINTER OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
WHAT EDITORIAL DID HE GET THAT FROM SHE WONDERED AS SHE PROTESTED SEE HERE MY BELOVED WHY CAN'T YOU TORIES DECLARE WAR HONESTLY YOU DON'T OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZER BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S SEDITIOUS
ASKING A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM HAD HE HAD ANY COLDS DID HE STILL DAWDLE OVER HIS OATMEAL WHAT ABOUT UNFORTUNATE MORNING INCIDENTS
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME GO WITH YOU TO PARIS AND STUDY ART MAYBE AND WEAR VELVETEEN PANTS AND A WOMAN'S BONNET AND LIVE ON SPAGHETTI NO I THINK WE CAN SAVE YOU THAT TROUBLE YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND I AM GOING I REALLY AM
DISLOYAL NON PATRIOTIC PRO GERMAN PACIFISTS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DID THIS ORGANIZER SAY ANYTHING PRO GERMAN NOT ON YOUR LIFE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE HIS LAUGH WAS STAGEY
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
CHAMP WAS BROKEN HIS RHEUMATISM WAS WORSE THE ROOMS OVER THE STORE WERE SILENT HE COULD NOT DO HIS WORK AS BUYER AT THE ELEVATOR FARMERS COMING IN WITH SLED LOADS OF WHEAT COMPLAINED THAT CHAMP COULD NOT READ THE SCALE
WHICH MADE THE REARING OF CITIZENS MORE COSTLY AND PERILOUS THAN ANY OTHER CRIME IT WAS INADVISABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN TILL HE HAD MADE MORE MONEY SHE WAS SORRY PERHAPS HE HAD MADE ALL THE MYSTERY OF LOVE A MECHANICAL CAUTIOUSNESS BUT
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
WHEN HE FOUND OUT I CAME FROM MINNESOTA HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW DOCTOR CLEMWORTH OF RED WING AND OF COURSE WHILE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'VE HEARD OF CLEMWORTH LOTS OF TIMES AND SEEMS HE'S THIS MAN'S BROTHER QUITE A COINCIDENCE
THEY WENT TO SUNDAY SERVICE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR MISSIONARY LECTURES CHURCH SUPPERS PRECISELY AS THEY HAD AT HOME THEY AGREED THAT AMBASSADORS AND FLIPPANT NEWSPAPERMEN AND INFIDEL SCIENTISTS OF THE BUREAUS
HIS DUTY OF VIEWING SIGHTS AND CURIOS PERFORMED WITH THOROUGHNESS UNCONSCIOUS OF HER HE STOOPED AND PEERED IN AT THE BLUE FLAMES AMONG THE COALS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BRISKLY AND MADE A WHIRLING GESTURE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND OUT OF PURE BLISS
NICE LIL WIFEY I'LL SAY DOC AND WHEN SHE ANSWERED NOT WARMLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE IMPRIMATUR HE BLEW ON HER NECK AND DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN INSULTED
BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
THE MOB FLOWING BETWEEN THE SQUATTY ROWS OF SHOPS HAD TAKEN THE ORGANIZER FROM HIS HOTEL RIDDEN HIM ON A FENCE RAIL PUT HIM ON A FREIGHT TRAIN AND WARNED HIM NOT TO RETURN THE STORY WAS THRESHED OUT IN DAVE DYER'S DRUG STORE
THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
AND MY OWN SON REPROVES ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION BUT THE STORY DOESN'T GO RIGHT I'M NEITHER GROANING NOR BEING DRAMATICALLY SAVED I KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY AND I ENJOY IT I'M MAD WITH JOY OVER IT
AND THE DOGGED WAY IN WHICH HE ACCUMULATED DATES AND DIMENSIONS WHEN THEY FOLLOWED MONKISH GUIDES THROUGH MISSIONS SHE FELT STRONG WHENEVER SHE WAS RESTLESS SHE DODGED HER THOUGHTS BY THE FAMILIAR VAGABOND FALLACY OF RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM OF MOVING ON TO A NEW PLACE
WE BETTER STOP IN HERE AND PHONE FOR A MACHINE SHE FOLLOWED HIM LIKE A WET KITTEN THE HAYDOCKS SAW THEM LABORING UP THE SLIPPERY CONCRETE WALK UP THE PERILOUS FRONT STEPS AND CAME TO THE DOOR CHANTING WELL WELL WELL BACK AGAIN EH
BUT LOOK HERE PROFESSOR DEAR WHISPERED SYLVIE HE NEEDN'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR US AT ALL WE CAN GO OUT WITH YOU TRUE DEAR CHILD THE PROFESSOR THANKFULLY REPLIED AS HE REPLACED THE COINS IN HIS POCKET THAT SAVES TWO SHILLINGS
LESS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD SHOW IT BY SUCH WILD DANCES SUCH CRAZY SONGS
BUT YOU LIKE A DOG WHEN IT WAGS ITS TAIL SYLVIE INTERRUPTED
TILL WHAT IS DARK BE LIGHT TILL WHAT IS WRONG
SHOULD IT NOT BE READ OUT FIRST MY LADY ENQUIRED NO NEED NO NEED
HAVE YOU EVER HAPPENED TO NOTICE ANOTHER PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE ME BUT DIFFERENT NEVER SHOUTED THE GARDENER SO LOUDLY AND VIOLENTLY THAT WE ALL DREW BACK IN ALARM THERE AIN'T SUCH A THING
HE LET IT ADVANCE UPON THE SCARED BOY MY LADY WITH ADMIRABLE PRESENCE OF MIND KEPT UP WHAT SHE NO DOUBT INTENDED FOR A SAVAGE GROWL THOUGH IT WAS MORE LIKE THE PURRING OF A CAT
WHICH CONTINUED TO RUN WILDLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD LASHING ITS TAIL LIKE A LITTLE LION LET'S FOLLOW IT SAID SYLVIE
PLEASE I'M SYLVIE AND WHO'S THAT OTHER THING SAID THE GARDENER WHAT THING SAID SYLVIE LOOKING ROUND OH THAT'S BRUNO HE'S MY BROTHER
THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIMSELF DREAMILY WHEN THE CHILDREN HAD FINISHED THEIR RATHER CONFUSED ACCOUNT OF THE AMBASSADOR'S VISIT GATHERED NO DOUBT FROM GENERAL REPORT AS THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM THEMSELVES FROM BAD TO WORSE
WHO WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG AS USUAL AND BUSILY EMPLOYED IN WATERING A BED OF FLOWERS WITH AN EMPTY WATERING CAN IT HASN'T GOT NO WATER IN IT BRUNO EXPLAINED TO HIM PULLING HIS SLEEVE TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION IT'S LIGHTER TO HOLD SAID THE GARDENER
AS HE SANK HALF FAINTING AT MY LADY'S FEET SHAVE YOU OF
AND THEN ITS EYES LOOKED UNHAPPY NOT BOTH ITS EYES SYLVIE INTERRUPTED COURSE NOT SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW
THEY'LL NOT TREAT HER BAD YER MAY DEPEND
BUT I HOPE TO RUN DOWN AGAIN IN A MONTH I ADDED I WOULD STAY NOW IF I COULD I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO BE ALONE
IT WOULD BE DROWNDED BRUNO PRONOUNCED CONFIDENTLY THE OTHER PROFESSOR GASPED WHAT WOULD BE DROWNDED WHY THE BUMBLE BEE OF COURSE SAID BRUNO AND THE TWO BITS WOULD SINK DOWN IN THE SEA
A DISCORDANT VOICE YELLED IN OUR EARS WERE
IT APPEARED TO ME THAT A CONVERSATION WOULD SCARCELY BE COMFABLE WHILE TREES WERE BEING CLIMBED EVEN IF BOTH THE PEOPLES WERE DOING IT
SAID BRUNO SOON AS WE'VE DONE TALKING
A DEVELOPMENT WORTHY OF DARWIN THE LADY EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ONLY YOU REVERSE HIS THEORY
THIS DEBT WILL SIMPLY SWALLOW ALL AND MAKE MY LIFE A LIFE OF WOE NAY NAY NAY PETER ANSWERED PAUL YOU MUST NOT RAIL ON FORTUNE SO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK YOU ARE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD
WHAT DID YOU GET THIS DAGGER FOR COME NO EVASIONS YOU CA'N'T DECEIVE ME
TAKE CARE SYLVIE ANXIOUSLY EXCLAIMED AS HE BEGAN RATHER CLUMSILY TO POINT IT YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGER OFF IF YOU HOLD THE KNIFE SO IF OO CUTS IT OFF WILL OO GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE BRUNO THOUGHTFULLY ADDED
AND IN THE ACT OF STARTING WHILE OH WOE FOR THE GOLDEN DREAM OF WORLD WIDE BENEVOLENCE THAT HAD DAZZLED MY DREAMING FANCY THE WOUNDED YOUTH WAS ONCE MORE RECLINING ON THE HEAP OF PILLOWS HIS PALE FACE SET RIGIDLY IN THE HARD LINES THAT TOLD OF PAIN RESOLUTELY ENDURED
THIS STYLE OF BUSINESS SEEMS TO ME EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT NO NOBLENESS OF SOUL HAVE I LIKE SOME THAT IN THIS AGE ARE FOUND
WE MUST SPREAD A REPORT OF HIS DEATH A LITTLE CONSPIRACY A CONSPIRACY CRIED THE DELIGHTED LADY CLAPPING HER HANDS OF ALL THINGS I DO LIKE A CONSPIRACY IT'S SO INTERESTING
AND STILL THE HOUSE WOULD BE FALLING FALLING FALLING BUT NOW AS TO THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THINGS NOTHING CAN BE HEAVY YOU KNOW EXCEPT BY TRYING TO FALL AND BEING PREVENTED FROM DOING SO YOU ALL GRANT THAT
THUNDERED THE VICE WARDEN AND TAKE THIS AND A RESOUNDING BOX ON THE EAR MADE THE UNFORTUNATE PROFESSOR REEL ACROSS THE ROOM
TO BE A BRIDE THE FATHER IN ORDER TO DO HIS PART IN A CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED ONLY FIT FOR LUNATICS REPLIED WHISPER IT TO ME DEAR BUT SHE DIDN'T WHISPER THESE CHILDREN NEVER DID ANYTHING THEY WERE TOLD
I COULD NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MY CHILD MARRIED TO A MAN WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO LIVE FOR WITHOUT EVEN AN OBJECT TO DIE FOR I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY A STRANGE VOICE SAID THE SPEAKER WAS EVIDENTLY IN THE ROOM BUT I HAD NOT HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND I LOOKED ROUND IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
TO BE TAKEN FEASTING THREE TIMES A DAY BUT DOCTOR I REMONSTRATED
STILL I DID NOT VENTURE TO DISOBEY THE INJUNCTIONS CRAZY AS I FELT THEM TO BE OF THE LOVESICK YOUNG DOCTOR BY SO MUCH AS ALLUDING TO HIS EXISTENCE
THAT HE HAD THE FEET OF AN ELEPHANT BUT THE REST OF HIM WAS SKIN AND BONE AND THE WISPS OF LOOSE STRAW THAT BRISTLED ALL ABOUT HIM SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY STUFFED WITH IT AND THAT NEARLY ALL THE STUFFING HAD COME OUT
CROSSING THE ROOM AND OPENING A CUPBOARD FROM WHICH SHE PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH TWO SLICES OF PLUM CAKE EAT AND DON'T CRY WERE HER SHORT AND SIMPLE ORDERS AND THE POOR CHILDREN SAT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE BUT SEEMED IN NO MOOD FOR EATING FOR THE SECOND TIME THE DOOR OPENED
DIED DOWN SO SUDDENLY THAT THE COOK HAD ONLY JUST TIME TO CATCH ITS LAST FLICKER ON THE END OF A MATCH OR HOW THE MAID HAVING TAKEN THE MUTTON OFF THE SPIT CARRIED IT BACKWARDS OF COURSE OUT OF THE HOUSE TO MEET THE BUTCHER WHO WAS COMING ALSO BACKWARDS DOWN THE ROAD
AND START AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SHORT END AT LAST ALL THE WORK WAS PICKED TO PIECES AND PUT AWAY AND THE LADY LED THE WAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM WALKING BACKWARDS AND MAKING THE INSANE REMARK NOT YET DEAR WE MUST GET THE SEWING DONE FIRST
AND SECONDLY IF HE'S SEEN THE OTHER PROFESSOR WE SHALL FIND HIM THAT WAY AND IF HE HASN'T WE SHA'N'T
HE UNROLLED A LARGE PARCHMENT SCROLL AND READ ALOUD THE WORDS ITEM THAT WE WILL BE KIND TO THE POOR THE CHANCELLOR WORDED IT FOR ME HE ADDED GLANCING AT THAT GREAT FUNCTIONARY
THE OLD MAN FALTERED
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT A POST IN INDIA THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED ME
IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE IT FOR THAT WOULD BE TO GET AHEAD OF IT IN THE RACE AND IT COULD NEVER OVERTAKE THE FAILING FLOOR
IT MIGHT STICK TO SOMETHING YOU KNOW AND THAT SOMEFIN WOULD HAVE TO GO BY THE POST WHAT EVER IT WAS BRUNO EAGERLY EXCLAIMED SUPPOSE IT WAS A COW WOULDN'T IT BE DREADFUL FOR THE OTHER THINGS AND ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM SAID THE PROFESSOR
I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT I FREELY CONFESS IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THEN WHY SHOULD I EXPECT IT OF MY READER WHO QUITE POSSIBLY HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT
THE PROFESSOR FERVENTLY RESPONDED QUITE FAILING TO TAKE THE HINT THE VICE WARDEN RESUMED THE THREAD OF HIS DISCOURSE THE REASON I MENTIONED IT PROFESSOR
EACH OF THEM THREADED HER NEEDLE WITH A SHORT END OF THREAD ATTACHED TO THE WORK WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PULLED BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE THROUGH THE STUFF DRAGGING THE NEEDLE AFTER IT THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF THE LITTLE SEMPSTRESS CAUGHT IT AT THE OTHER SIDE BUT ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN THE NEXT MOMENT
NAMING NO NAMES AS IF THERE WERE ONLY ONE SHE IN THE WORLD TILL YOU HAD SEEN MORE OF HER AND FORMED YOUR OWN JUDGMENT OF HER
THE FOOL SMILED A DOUBTFUL SMILE
AND MAKING ROOM AMONG THEM FOR THE ONE THE WARDEN HAD JUST HANDED TO HIM THESE ARE MERELY THE ROUGH COPIES HE EXPLAINED AND AS SOON AS I HAVE PUT IN THE FINAL CORRECTIONS MAKING A GREAT COMMOTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT PARCHMENTS A SEMI COLON OR TWO THAT I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED
PERTURBED SPIRIT IS SUCH A HAPPY PHRASE PERTURBED REFERRING NO DOUBT SHE REJOINED
IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EARL OF AINSLIE WHO HAD TAKEN IT FOR THE SEASON AND RENEW ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER LADY MURIEL
GATHERING UP A HANDFUL OF DUST AND SCATTERING IT IN THE AIR HE SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY PRONOUNCED SOME WORDS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A CHARM THE CHILDREN LOOKING ON IN AWE STRUCK SILENCE
HE MAKES HAMLET SAY REST REST PERTURBED SPIRIT AND THAT I SUPPOSE MEANS AN EASY CHAIR AN AMERICAN ROCKING CHAIR I THINK FAYFIELD JUNCTION MY LADY CHANGE FOR ELVESTON THE GUARD ANNOUNCED FLINGING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CARRIAGE
SO A COURSE IT DID OO KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD REASON BRUNO I SAID
GROANED THE OTHER CONSPIRATOR WHY THEY AREN'T WORTH HALF THE MONEY PUT TOGETHER ON MY BIRTHDAY MY LADY CONCLUDED IN A MEEK WHISPER ONE MUST HAVE A DAGGER YOU KNOW IT'S
HE ISN'T INDEED MY LADY WAS APPEASED
AMBITION SPITE BE QUENCHED IN REASON'S NIGHT
I WAS PASSING A PRETTY LITTLE VILLA WHICH STOOD RATHER BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS IN FRONT CREEPERS WANDERING OVER THE WALLS AND HANGING IN FESTOONS ABOUT THE BOW WINDOWS AN EASY CHAIR FORGOTTEN ON THE LAWN WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING NEAR IT
THAT WE SHOULD GO SEPARATELY TO THE HOUSE MY INTENTION BEING TO ARRIVE SOME TIME AFTER HIM SO AS TO GIVE HIM TIME TO GET OVER A MEETING WITH THIS OBJECT
THE DETECTED CONSPIRATOR STAMMERED TRYING HER BEST TO PUT ON THE ASSASSIN EXPRESSION THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRACTISING AT THE LOOKING GLASS
ALL TEND ONE WAY FROM BAD TO WORSE AND YOU MY DARLINGS MUST SUFFER IT AWHILE I FEAR YET WHEN THINGS ARE AT THEIR WORST YOU CAN COME TO ME
AND HAS BEEN ALL BUT RUN OVER BY A PASSING HANSOM AND I THINK HE HAS TOO LONELY A LIFE SHE WENT ON WITH A GENTLE EARNESTNESS THAT LEFT NO ROOM WHATEVER TO SUSPECT A DOUBLE MEANING
DON'T YOU BE A GREAT BLETHERING GOOSE
AND TOOK THE SEAWARD ROAD THAT LED TO MY LODGINGS THE GOOD I FANCIED I COULD DO IS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM THE EVIL OF THIS TROUBLESOME WORLD IS THE ONLY ABIDING REALITY
THE EARL SEEMED TO SHARE MY SURPRISE WHO SPOKE HE EXCLAIMED IT WAS I SAID ARTHUR LOOKING AT US WITH A WORN HAGGARD FACE AND EYES FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF LIFE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE FADED
THERE ISN'T SUCH A DOG AS THAT SYLVIE THOUGHTFULLY REMARKED BUT THERE WOULD BE CRIED BRUNO IF THE PROFESSOR SHORTENED IT UP FOR US
THAT'S WHAT I GOT IT FOR
BUT I COULD SEE HIS EYES FILL WITH TEARS AS HE BENT HIS HEAD AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HER FOREHEAD IN A LONG LOVING KISS
AN EMPTY FORK IS RAISED TO THE LIPS THERE IT RECEIVES A NEATLY CUT PIECE OF MUTTON AND SWIFTLY CONVEYS IT TO THE PLATE WHERE IT INSTANTLY ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE MUTTON ALREADY THERE SOON ONE OF THE PLATES FURNISHED WITH A COMPLETE SLICE OF MUTTON AND TWO POTATOES
WHAT'S ALL THIS NOISE ABOUT THE VICE WARDEN ANGRILY ENQUIRED AS HE STRODE INTO THE ROOM AND WHO PUT THE HAT STAND HERE AND HE HUNG HIS HAT UP ON BRUNO
THE EARL WAS SITTING ALONE WHEN WE ENTERED I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME IN TO KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID MURIEL IS GONE TO BED THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER
HOW CAN YOU MAKE US DO IT THERE IS A MORE CURIOUS IDEA YET I VENTURED TO SAY SUPPOSE A CORD FASTENED TO THE HOUSE FROM BELOW AND PULLED DOWN BY SOME ONE ON THE PLANET
AND AT LAST THEY PARTED I WAITED TILL THEY WERE SOME TWENTY YARDS APART AND THEN PUT THE WATCH A MINUTE BACK THE INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE WAS STARTLING THE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO FLASH BACK INTO THEIR FORMER PLACES ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK
HE ARE TOO FAT WE HAD NO SORT OF DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE GARDENER THOUGH HE WAS HIDDEN FROM US BY SOME TREES THAT HARSH VOICE OF HIS SERVED TO DIRECT US AND AS WE DREW NEARER
MUSTN'T CRY LIKE THAT THE VICE WARDEN SAID SHARPLY BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT ON THE WEEPING CHILDREN CHEER EM UP A BIT HE HINTED TO MY LADY CAKE MY LADY MUTTERED TO HERSELF WITH GREAT DECISION
OH DON'T TALK OF CONSPIRACIES HER HUSBAND SAVAGELY INTERRUPTED AS HE TOSSED THE DAGGER INTO THE CUPBOARD
NO CERTAINLY NOT
AS HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LOCKET NOW SYLVIE LOOK AT THIS AND HE SHOWED HER LYING ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND A LOCKET OF A DEEP CRIMSON COLOUR THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BLUE ONE AND LIKE IT ATTACHED TO A SLENDER GOLDEN CHAIN LOVELIER AND LOVELIER EXCLAIMED SYLVIE
RESOLVED TO GUARD THE TREASURE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND A FRONT DOOR STANDING INVITINGLY HALF OPEN HERE IS MY CHANCE I THOUGHT FOR TESTING THE REVERSE ACTION OF THE MAGIC WATCH I PRESSED THE REVERSAL PEG AND WALKED IN
THE PROFESSOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY IN MY DIRECTION AND SEEMED TO LOOK THROUGH AND THROUGH ME WITHOUT SEEING ME THEN WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO HE SAID THERE ISN'T ANYBODY HERE YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE OTHER PROFESSOR AND HE ISN'T HERE HE ADDED WILDLY TURNING ROUND AND ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM
LADY MURIEL AND HER FATHER GAVE ME A DELIGHTFULLY WARM WELCOME THEY WERE NOT OF THE FOLK WE MEET IN FASHIONABLE DRAWING ROOMS WHO CONCEAL ALL SUCH FEELINGS AS THEY MAY CHANCE TO POSSESS BENEATH
I DON'T BELIEVE NO CROCODILE NEVER WALKED ALONG ITS OWN FOREHEAD SYLVIE CRIED
SHE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HER HANDS YOU DO LOOK
SYLVIE ECHOED AND ONE DAY WHEN WE WAS IN OUTLAND OO KNOW BEFORE WE CAME TO FAIRYLAND
HE SIGHED TO FIND THE STATE OF THINGS GROW LESS AND LESS CONVENIENT WEEKS GREW TO MONTHS AND MONTHS TO YEARS PETER WAS WORN TO SKIN AND BONE
BUT THERE'S A HEART WITHIN THIS BREAST AND I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE NOT SO WAS PETER'S MILD REPLY HIS CHEEKS ALL WET WITH GRATEFUL TEARS NO MAN RECALLS SO WELL AS I YOUR SERVICES IN BYGONE YEARS
IT WAS A FEMALE VOICE ALSO THE FIGURE HALF HIDDEN BY THE CUPBOARD DOOR WAS A FEMALE FIGURE MASSIVE AND IN FLOWING ROBES COULD IT BE THE LANDLADY THE DOOR OPENED
HE REMARKED EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT BUT MY LADY WOULD NOT BE CHECKED HE IS A CLEVER BOY SHE CONTINUED WITH ENTHUSIASM BUT HE NEEDS A MAN LIKE YOUR LORDSHIP TO DRAW HIM OUT THE CHANCELLOR BIT HIS LIP
BRUNO SCORNFULLY RETORTED IT HAD A WELLY GOOD REASON I HEERD IT SAY WHY SHOULDN'T I WALK ON MY OWN
IT'S LIKE THIS SAID THE OTHER PROFESSOR HASTILY DRAWING A LONG LINE UPON THE BLACK BOARD AND MARKING THE LETTERS A B AT THE TWO ENDS AND C IN THE MIDDLE LET ME EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IF A B WERE TO BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS AT C
AND SO INTENT WERE THEY ON THIS INTERESTING QUESTION THAT NEITHER OF THEM EVEN LOOKED UP TILL THE PROFESSOR
AND SUCH HORRID MEALS WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TO DAY SAID THE PROFESSOR A LITTLE PIECE OF A DEAD CROW WAS BRUNO'S MOURNFUL REPLY HE MEANS ROOK PIE SYLVIE EXPLAINED
ONCE MORE A FEELING OF WONDER ROSE IN MY MIND AS TO HOW IN THE WORLD WE WERE TO GET BACK AGAIN SINCE I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT WHEREVER THE CHILDREN WENT I WAS TO GO
GOOD NIGHT AY THEY ARE THAT GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
AND ALL ITS MYSTERY HE SAID IS CLEAR AS DAY TO ME I SHALL NOW RETURN SAID THE PROFESSOR WHEN WE HAD WALKED A FEW YARDS YOU SEE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ HERE FOR ALL MY BOOKS ARE IN THE HOUSE
THE RESULT WAS ONE THAT IF ONLY I HAD CONSIDERED THE THING CAREFULLY I MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN AS THE HAND OF THE WATCH TOUCHED THE MARK THE SPRING CART WHICH HAD DRIVEN OFF AND WAS BY THIS TIME HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE DOOR
HOW FEW IN THIS COLD AGE OF GREED DO GOOD EXCEPT ON SELFISH GROUNDS BUT I CAN FEEL FOR PETER'S NEED AND I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS HOW GREAT WAS PETER'S JOY TO FIND HIS FRIEND IN SUCH A GENIAL VEIN
SHE PLEADED IT'S IT'S DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S A
OR FAILING THAT UNTIL BRUNO COMES OF AGE AND THAT HE SHALL THEN HAND OVER TO MYSELF OR TO BRUNO AS THE CASE MAY BE THE WARDENSHIP THE UNSPENT REVENUE AND THE CONTENTS OF THE TREASURY WHICH ARE TO BE PRESERVED INTACT UNDER HIS GUARDIANSHIP
THAT WOULD BE AWKWARD I ADMITTED TAKING IT QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE HAD SO SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME BUT DON'T YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE HAPPY BRUNO NOT ALWAYS BRUNO SAID THOUGHTFULLY SOMETIMES WHEN I'S TOO HAPPY I WANTS TO BE A LITTLE MISERABLE
WHAT SIZE WILL YOU BE I ENQUIRED
AS EVINCING AN UNDUE DESIRE TO REACH AND IMPRESS THE UNTRAINED SENSIBILITIES OF THE VULGAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL OF HIGH BREEDING IT IS ONLY THE MORE HONORIFIC ESTEEM ACCORDED BY THE CULTIVATED SENSE OF THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN HIGH CLASS
ORDINARILY HIS MOTIVE IS A WISH TO CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED USAGE TO AVOID UNFAVORABLE NOTICE AND COMMENT TO LIVE UP TO THE ACCEPTED CANONS OF DECENCY IN THE KIND AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED
UNDERSTANDING BY THE ADULT TEMPERAMENT THE AVERAGE TEMPERAMENT OF THOSE ADULT INDIVIDUALS IN MODERN INDUSTRIAL LIFE WHO HAVE SOME SERVICEABILITY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COLLECTIVE LIFE PROCESS AND WHO MAY THEREFORE BE SAID TO MAKE UP THE EFFECTIVE AVERAGE
IT IS ONLY IN THE CRASSER EXPRESSIONS OF DEVOUT FANCY THAT THIS INTRUSION OF PECUNIARY CANONS INTO THE DEVOUT IDEALS REACHES SUCH AN EXTREME AN EXTREME CASE OCCURS IN THE DEVOUT IMAGERY OF THE NEGRO POPULATION OF THE SOUTH
WAR IS HONORABLE AND WARLIKE PROWESS IS EMINENTLY HONORIFIC IN THE EYES OF THE GENERALITY OF MEN AND THIS ADMIRATION OF WARLIKE PROWESS IS ITSELF THE BEST VOUCHER OF A PREDATORY TEMPERAMENT IN THE ADMIRER OF WAR THE ENTHUSIASM FOR WAR
THAN THE DWELLING HOUSES OF THE CONGREGATION THIS IS TRUE OF NEARLY ALL DENOMINATIONS AND CULTS WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR PAGAN BUT IT IS TRUE IN A PECULIAR DEGREE OF THE OLDER AND MATURER CULTS
WITH WHICH APPAREL ORIGINATED THE MOTIVE OF ADORNMENT WITHOUT GOING INTO AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION OF HOW AND WHY THIS MOTIVE ASSERTS ITSELF UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE LAW OF EXPENSIVENESS IT MAY BE STATED BROADLY
AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THIS WEALTH WHICH IS HELD SACRED IS VALUED PRIMARILY FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD REPUTE TO BE GOT THROUGH ITS CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
IN ORDINARY TIMES THE LARGE BODY OF THE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES IS RELATIVELY APATHETIC TOUCHING WARLIKE INTERESTS WHEN UNEXCITED THIS BODY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE WHICH MAKES UP THE EFFECTIVE FORCE OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY
FOR THE FACT OF ITS BEING PERFUNCTORY GOES TO SAY POINTEDLY THAT THE MASTER FOR WHOM IT IS PERFORMED IS EXALTED ABOVE THE VULGAR NEED OF ACTUALLY PROFICUOUS SERVICE ON THE PART OF HIS SERVANTS THEY ARE UNPROFITABLE SERVANTS
AND THOSE PROPENSITIES WHICH ARE ALREADY ACTIVELY IN THE FIELD UNDER SOME RELATED FORM OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE AIDED BY THE POINTED SUGGESTIONS AFFORDED BY A CURRENT ACCREDITED SCHEME OF LIFE AND FOR THE EXERCISE OF WHICH THE MATERIAL MEANS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE READILY AVAILABLE
SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID OF ITS RELATION TO THE CANONS OF REPUTABILITY THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE GUIDES THE FORMATION OF HABITS OF THOUGHT AS TO WHAT IS HONEST AND REPUTABLE IN LIFE AND IN COMMODITIES
THE HOLIDAY USE OF THE CONTRIVANCE IS DUE TO IMITATION OF A HIGHER CLASS CANON OF DECENCY UPWARDS FROM THIS LOW LEVEL OF INDIGENCE AND MANUAL LABOR THE CORSET WAS UNTIL WITHIN A GENERATION OR TWO
A CLOSER EXAMINATION HOWEVER WILL SHOW THAT THIS APPARENT EXCEPTION IS REALLY A VERIFICATION OF THE RULE THAT THE VOGUE OF ANY GIVEN ELEMENT OR FEATURE IN DRESS RESTS ON ITS UTILITY AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STANDING
WHILE MEN ARE RELUCTANT TO RETRENCH THEIR EXPENDITURES IN ANY DIRECTION THEY ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO RETRENCH IN SOME DIRECTIONS THAN IN OTHERS SO THAT WHILE ANY ACCUSTOMED CONSUMPTION IS RELUCTANTLY GIVEN UP THERE ARE CERTAIN LINES OF CONSUMPTION WHICH ARE GIVEN UP WITH RELATIVELY EXTREME RELUCTANCE
IN SO DOING THIS PRINCIPLE WILL TRAVERSE OTHER NORMS OF CONDUCT WHICH DO NOT PRIMARILY HAVE TO DO WITH THE CODE OF PECUNIARY HONOR BUT WHICH HAVE DIRECTLY OR INCIDENTALLY AN ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SOME MAGNITUDE
NO LESS EFFECTUALLY THAN BY SUCH A LUXURIOUS LIFE AS WILL SHUT OUT DISCONTENT BY CUTTING OFF THE OCCASION FOR IT THE ABJECTLY POOR AND ALL THOSE PERSONS WHOSE ENERGIES ARE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE STRUGGLE FOR DAILY SUSTENANCE
THE PREVALENCE OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY AMONG ALL CLASSES IS OF COURSE NOT TRACEABLE WHOLLY TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE WEALTHY LEISURE CLASS
ACCORDING TO THE IDEAL SCHEME OF THE PECUNIARY CULTURE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE IS THE CHIEF MENIAL OF THE HOUSEHOLD BESIDES SERVANTS CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED AS SUCH THERE IS AT LEAST ONE OTHER CLASS OF PERSONS WHOSE GARB
WITH MORE OR LESS MITIGATION IN ITS TURN THE SCHEME OF LIFE OF CONVENTIONS ACTS SELECTIVELY AND BY EDUCATION TO SHAPE THE HUMAN MATERIAL AND ITS ACTION RUNS CHIEFLY IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSERVING TRAITS HABITS AND IDEALS
THE EFFECT OF THE LATTER IN SHAPING THE ACCEPTED SCHEME OF LIFE IS YET TO BE DISCUSSED THE CANON OF REPUTABILITY THEN MUST ADAPT ITSELF TO THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES
ORDINARILY WITH A VIEW TO HEIGHTENING THE SPECTACULAR EFFECT OF THE AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE CONTEMPLATED AS INCREASED INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROCURE THE MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD WITH LESS LABOR
TO APPLY THIS GENERALIZATION TO WOMEN'S DRESS AND PUT THE MATTER IN CONCRETE TERMS THE HIGH HEEL THE SKIRT THE IMPRACTICABLE BONNET THE CORSET AND THE GENERAL DISREGARD
THE PURPOSE IS SIMPLY TO POINT OUT WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATION OF THESE CLASSES TO THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS AND TO ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS THEIR OFFICE IS OF A PARASITIC CHARACTER
OR PERHAPS OFTENER LESS OFFENSIVE THAN THAT WHICH IT DISPLACES BUT IT MUST ALSO COME UP TO THE ACCEPTED STANDARD OF EXPENSIVENESS IT WOULD SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE RESULT OF SUCH AN UNREMITTING STRUGGLE
AND THERE IS AN HONORIFIC IMPLICATION FOR THEIR MASTER IN THEIR REMAINING UNPROFITABLE IT IS NEEDLESS TO POINT OUT THE CLOSE ANALOGY AT THIS POINT BETWEEN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF THE FOOTMAN
CHAPTER SIX PECUNIARY CANONS OF TASTE THE CAUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE
HE DOES NOT ORDINARILY INCUR THE EXTREME PENALTY OR THE EXTREME OBLOQUY WITH WHICH HIS OFFENSES WOULD BE VISITED ON THE GROUND OF THE NAIVE MORAL CODE ALONE THE THIEF OR SWINDLER WHO HAS GAINED GREAT WEALTH BY HIS DELINQUENCY
IN AN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THIS PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION EXPRESSES ITSELF IN PECUNIARY EMULATION AND THIS SO FAR AS REGARDS THE WESTERN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES OF THE PRESENT IS VIRTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT EXPRESSES ITSELF IN SOME FORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
BUT THE PRACTICE AND THE INSISTENCE ON IT ARE NO DOUBT STRENGTHENED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE LEISURE CLASS
THEY ARE APPLIED SIMPLY FROM THE MORALLY COLORLESS EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT
THE NEED OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THEREFORE STANDS READY TO ABSORB ANY INCREASE IN THE COMMUNITY'S INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY OR OUTPUT OF GOODS AFTER THE MOST ELEMENTARY PHYSICAL WANTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR WHERE THIS RESULT DOES NOT FOLLOW UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS
IS SET BY THE USAGE OF THOSE NEXT ABOVE US IN REPUTABILITY UNTIL IN THIS WAY ESPECIALLY IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT VAGUE ALL CANONS OF REPUTABILITY AND DECENCY AND ALL STANDARDS OF CONSUMPTION
ESPECIALLY THE WEALTHY CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY DEVELOP IN WEALTH AND MOBILITY AND IN THE RANGE OF THEIR HUMAN CONTACT THE MORE IMPERATIVELY WILL THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE ASSERT ITSELF IN MATTERS OF DRESS
THE CHARACTER OF THE SACRED PARAPHERNALIA IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT IN THOSE CULTS WHERE THE HABITS OF LIFE IMPUTED TO THE DIVINITY MORE NEARLY APPROACH THOSE OF AN EARTHLY PATRIARCHAL POTENTATE WHERE HE IS CONCEIVED TO MAKE USE OF THESE CONSUMABLE GOODS IN PERSON
IF A PERSON SO ENDOWED WITH A PROCLIVITY FOR EXPLOITS IS IN A POSITION TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HABITS IN THE ADOLESCENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THE INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERTS IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSERVATION AND REVERSION TO PROWESS MAY BE VERY CONSIDERABLE
THERE IS AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE IN POINT OF PERSISTENCE UNDER COUNTERACTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN POINT OF THE DEGREE OF IMPERATIVENESS WITH WHICH THE DISCHARGE SEEKS A GIVEN DIRECTION THAT IS TO SAY IN THE LANGUAGE OF CURRENT ECONOMIC THEORY
WHICH MUST BE LIVED UP TO AND BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO GO THE STANDARD IS FLEXIBLE AND ESPECIALLY IT IS INDEFINITELY EXTENSIBLE IF ONLY TIME IS ALLOWED FOR HABITUATION TO ANY INCREASE IN PECUNIARY ABILITY
OR OF THE THEISTIC FAITH IN ANY COUNTRY OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION OR SUPPOSE THE SUPPRESSION OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN CHINA OR OF THE CASTE SYSTEM IN INDIA OR OF SLAVERY IN AFRICA
ARE ALSO EXEMPLIFIED IN THE SAME CONTRIVANCES OTHER METHODS OF PUTTING ONE'S PECUNIARY STANDING IN EVIDENCE SERVE THEIR END EFFECTUALLY
IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SCRUPULOUSLY SCREENED AND MASKED UNDER AN OSTENSIBLE AUSTERITY IN THE MOST REPUTABLE LATTER DAY HOUSES OF WORSHIP WHERE NO EXPENSE IS SPARED THE PRINCIPLE OF AUSTERITY IS CARRIED TO THE LENGTH OF MAKING THE FITTINGS OF THE PLACE A MEANS OF MORTIFYING THE FLESH
IS ALWAYS SO TRANSPARENT A MAKE BELIEVE AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL FUTILITY PRESENTLY FORCES ITSELF SO BALDLY UPON OUR ATTENTION AS TO BECOME UNBEARABLE AND THEN WE TAKE REFUGE IN A NEW STYLE
FOR EDIFICATION OR IN APPEAL TO THE DEVOUT FANCY THE DEVOUT WORD PAINTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE BRINGS OUT BEFORE HIS AUDITORS IMAGINATION A THRONE WITH A PROFUSION OF THE INSIGNIA OF OPULENCE AND POWER AND SURROUNDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF SERVITORS
IS ORDINARILY GIVEN UP LAST IN CASE OF A PROGRESSIVE RETRENCHMENT OF EXPENDITURE THAT IS TO SAY IN A GENERAL WAY THE MOST ANCIENT AND INGRAINED OF THE HABITS WHICH GOVERN THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE THOSE HABITS THAT TOUCH HIS EXISTENCE AS AN ORGANISM ARE THE MOST PERSISTENT AND IMPERATIVE
WHEN A GIVEN SET OF STIMULI HAVE COME TO BE HABITUALLY RESPONDED TO IN ACTIVITY OF A GIVEN KIND AND DIRECTION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THESE ALERT AND DEEP REACHING PROPENSITIES OF EMULATION IT IS WITH EXTREME RELUCTANCE THAT SUCH AN HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IS GIVEN UP
AND UNWORTHY MOTIVES OF MISERLINESS ARE IMPUTED TO THOSE WHO FALL SHORT IN THIS RESPECT A PROMPT RESPONSE TO THE STIMULUS ON THE OTHER HAND IS ACCEPTED AS THE NORMAL EFFECT
TO ACCEPT AND PRACTICE THE STANDARD OF LIVING WHICH IS IN VOGUE IS BOTH AGREEABLE AND EXPEDIENT COMMONLY TO THE POINT OF BEING INDISPENSABLE TO PERSONAL COMFORT AND TO SUCCESS IN LIFE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF ANY CLASS
THE GOOD NAME OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO WHICH SHE BELONGS SHOULD BE THE SPECIAL CARE OF THE WOMAN
WHICH SUCH A RADICAL CHANGE IN ANY ONE FEATURE OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF LIFE WOULD INVOLVE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SUGGEST THE SUPPRESSION OF THE MONOGAMIC FAMILY OR OF THE AGNATIC SYSTEM OF CONSANGUINITY OR OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
IT IS FELT THAT THE DIVINE PRESENCE IS ENTERED WITH THE BEST GRACE AND WITH THE BEST EFFECT ACCORDING TO CERTAIN ACCEPTED METHODS AND WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF CERTAIN MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IN POPULAR APPREHENSION ARE PECULIARLY CONSONANT WITH THE DIVINE NATURE
HOW GREATLY THE TRANSMITTED IDIOSYNCRASIES OF APTITUDE MAY COUNT IN THE WAY OF A RAPID AND DEFINITIVE FORMATION OF HABIT IN INDIVIDUALS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE EXTREME FACILITY WITH WHICH AN ALL DOMINATING HABIT OF ALCOHOLISM IS SOMETIMES FORMED
BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS WRONG TO SOME EXTENT THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A MORE OR LESS INADEQUATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE METHODS OF LIVING TO A SITUATION WHICH PREVAILED AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST DEVELOPMENT
ELEGANT DRESS SERVES ITS PURPOSE OF ELEGANCE NOT ONLY IN THAT IT IS EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS THE INSIGNIA OF LEISURE IT NOT ONLY SHOWS THAT THE WEARER IS ABLE TO CONSUME A RELATIVELY LARGE VALUE
NOR THAT OF BEAUTY ALONE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY REQUIRES THAT DRESS SHOULD SHOW WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE BUT ALL WASTEFULNESS IS OFFENSIVE TO NATIVE TASTE
OR IN THE SIMILAR FACILITY AND THE SIMILARLY INEVITABLE FORMATION OF A HABIT OF DEVOUT OBSERVANCES IN THE CASE OF PERSONS GIFTED WITH A SPECIAL APTITUDE IN THAT DIRECTION
SHADES OFF INTO THE OBLIGATORY UNPROVOKED PRIVATE FIGHT AS A SOCIAL OBLIGATION DUE TO ONE'S GOOD REPUTE AS A LEISURE CLASS USAGE OF THIS KIND WE HAVE PARTICULARLY THAT BIZARRE SURVIVAL OF BELLICOSE CHIVALRY THE GERMAN STUDENT DUEL
AND THE BEARING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE UPON SOME OF THE COMMONPLACE DEVOUT OBSERVANCES AND CONCEITS MAY THEREFORE BE POINTED OUT OBVIOUSLY THE CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR A GREAT PORTION OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED DEVOUT CONSUMPTION AS E G
MOST OFFENSES AGAINST PROPERTY ESPECIALLY OFFENSES OF AN APPRECIABLE MAGNITUDE COME UNDER THIS HEAD IT IS ALSO A MATTER OF COMMON NOTORIETY AND BYWORD THAT IN OFFENSES WHICH RESULT IN A LARGE ACCESSION OF PROPERTY TO THE OFFENDER
HAS A BETTER CHANCE THAN THE SMALL THIEF OF ESCAPING THE RIGOROUS PENALTY OF THE LAW AND SOME GOOD REPUTE ACCRUES TO HIM FROM HIS INCREASED WEALTH AND FROM HIS SPENDING THE IRREGULARLY ACQUIRED POSSESSIONS IN A SEEMLY MANNER
ON THE OTHER HAND THE ASSERTION FREELY GOES UNCONTRADICTED THAT STYLES IN VOGUE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO ARE MORE BECOMING THAN THE MOST ELABORATE AND PAINSTAKING CONSTRUCTIONS OF TODAY
AND ESPECIALLY IT TAKES TIME TO CHANGE THE HABITS OF THOSE CLASSES THAT ARE SOCIALLY MORE REMOTE FROM THE RADIANT BODY THE PROCESS IS SLOWER WHERE THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS LESS OR WHERE THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE SEVERAL CLASSES ARE WIDER AND MORE ABRUPT
THE PART PLAYED BY THIS ELEMENT OF APTITUDE IN DETERMINING THE RELATIVE TENACITY OF THE SEVERAL HABITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE STANDARD OF LIVING GOES TO EXPLAIN THE EXTREME RELUCTANCE WITH WHICH MEN GIVE UP ANY HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IN THE WAY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
FROM ANYTHING HABITUALLY PRACTICED BY THE MEN THIS FEATURE IS THE CLASS OF CONTRIVANCES OF WHICH THE CORSET IS THE TYPICAL EXAMPLE THE CORSET IS IN ECONOMIC THEORY SUBSTANTIALLY A MUTILATION
ESPECIALLY AS THEY MARK A MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TREND IN THE LATER AND MATURER DEVELOPMENT OF DRESS THE VOGUE OF THE CORSET OFFERS AN APPARENT EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE OF WHICH IT HAS HERE BEEN CITED AS AN ILLUSTRATION
BUT DRESS HAS SUBTLER AND MORE FAR REACHING POSSIBILITIES THAN THIS CRUDE FIRST HAND EVIDENCE OF WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION ONLY IF IN ADDITION TO SHOWING THAT THE WEARER CAN AFFORD TO CONSUME FREELY AND UNECONOMICALLY
BUT THE SCHEME OF LIFE OF THE CLASS IS IN LARGE PART A HERITAGE FROM THE PAST AND EMBODIES MUCH OF THE HABITS AND IDEALS OF THE EARLIER BARBARIAN PERIOD THIS ARCHAIC BARBARIAN SCHEME OF LIFE IMPOSES ITSELF ALSO ON THE LOWER ORDERS
NOR DOES IT SAY THAT THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE FIRED WITH MARTIAL ARDOR FOR A TIME UNDER THE STIMULUS OF SOME SPECIAL PROVOCATION SUCH AS IS SEEN IN OPERATION TODAY IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
BY VIRTUE OF ITS DESCENT FROM A PATRIARCHAL PAST OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM MAKES IT THE WOMAN'S FUNCTION IN AN ESPECIAL DEGREE TO PUT IN EVIDENCE HER HOUSEHOLD'S ABILITY TO PAY ACCORDING TO THE MODERN CIVILIZED SCHEME OF LIFE
HENCE THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF PEOPLE AS REGARDS THEIR DOMESTIC LIFE IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALLY DEVELOPED COMMUNITIES AND HENCE BY REMOTER DERIVATION THE HABIT OF PRIVACY AND RESERVE THAT IS SO LARGE A FEATURE IN THE CODE OF PROPRIETIES OF THE BETTER CLASS IN ALL COMMUNITIES
THE ATTITUDE OF THE CLASS SIMPLY AS INFLUENCED BY ITS CLASS INTEREST SHOULD THEREFORE BE TO LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE THIS INTERESTED MOTIVE COMES IN TO SUPPLEMENT THE STRONG INSTINCTIVE BIAS OF THE CLASS
WHEN AN ATTEMPTED REFORM INVOLVES THE SUPPRESSION OR THOROUGH GOING REMODELLING OF AN INSTITUTION OF FIRST RATE IMPORTANCE IN THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME IT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT A SERIOUS DERANGEMENT OF THE ENTIRE SCHEME WOULD RESULT
BUT IT IS FELT BY ALL MEN THAT A RIGHT AND ENLIGHTENED SENSE OF THE TRUE THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE GOOD DEMANDS THAT IN ALL EXPENDITURE ON THE SANCTUARY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SERVE THE COMFORT OF THE WORSHIPPER SHOULD BE CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IF ANY ELEMENT OF COMFORT IS ADMITTED IN THE FITTINGS OF THE SANCTUARY
IN SOME MEASURE MARKS OF AN ARRESTED SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT THEY MARK AN IMMATURE PHASE AS COMPARED WITH THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE ADULTS IN THE MODERN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY AND IT WILL APPEAR PRESENTLY
ARE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS INCREASED RELUCTANCE DUE TO THE SOLIDARITY OF HUMAN INSTITUTIONS IS THAT ANY INNOVATION CALLS FOR A GREATER EXPENDITURE OF NERVOUS ENERGY
OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THE ETHNIC COMPOSITION OF THE EUROPEAN POPULATIONS VARIES
A MORE OR LESS PROTRACTED AND LABORIOUS EFFORT TO FIND AND TO KEEP ONE'S BEARINGS UNDER THE ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PROCESS REQUIRES A CERTAIN EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY AND SO PRESUMES FOR ITS SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT
MUCH AS NATURE WAS ONCE SAID TO ABHOR A VACUUM BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE REQUIRES AN OBVIOUSLY FUTILE EXPENDITURE AND THE RESULTING CONSPICUOUS EXPENSIVENESS OF DRESS
THE LOW BIRTHRATE OF THE CLASSES UPON WHOM THE REQUIREMENTS OF REPUTABLE EXPENDITURE FALL WITH GREAT URGENCY IS LIKEWISE TRACEABLE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF A STANDARD OF LIVING BASED ON CONSPICUOUS WASTE THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSEQUENT INCREASED EXPENSE
THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE MORE OBVIOUSLY UNPRODUCTIVE THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ARE THE MORE CREDITABLE AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPUTABILITY OF THE HOUSEHOLD OR ITS HEAD WILL THEIR LIFE BE
IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY OBSERVED IN PRACTICE BUT IT WILL SCARCELY BE DISPUTED THAT IT IS ALWAYS PRESENT IN A MORE OR LESS DEFINITE WAY IN THE POPULAR HABITS OF THOUGHT
A SPECIFIC FORMAL OBSERVANCE CAN UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAINTAIN ITSELF IN FORCE IF WITH THE LAPSE OF TIME OR ON ITS TRANSMISSION TO A LOWER PECUNIARY CLASS IT IS FOUND TO RUN COUNTER TO THE ULTIMATE GROUND OF DECENCY AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES NAMELY
THAT EACH SUCCESSIVE INNOVATION IN THE FASHIONS IS AN EFFORT TO REACH SOME FORM OF DISPLAY WHICH SHALL BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR SENSE OF FORM AND COLOR OR OF EFFECTIVENESS THAN THAT WHICH IT DISPLACES
PRIESTLY DEMEANOR AT ITS BEST IS ALOOF LEISURELY PERFUNCTORY AND UNCONTAMINATED WITH SUGGESTIONS OF SENSUOUS PLEASURE THIS HOLDS TRUE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF COURSE FOR THE DIFFERENT CULTS AND DENOMINATIONS
DISCOVERING THE TWO LADIES RANDAL STOPPED IN THE DOORWAY AND STARED AT THEM IN ASTONISHMENT DIDN'T YOU EXPECT TO SEE US MISSUS PRESTY INQUIRED I HEARD YOU WERE HERE FROM OUR FRIEND SARRAZIN RANDAL SAID
SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HER WICKEDNESS SHE WAS EAGER TO SACRIFICE HERSELF FOR THE GOOD OF THE ONCE DEAR FRIEND WHOM SHE HAD WRONGED USELESS LONGINGS TOO LATE TOO LATE SHE REGRETTED IT BITTERLY
AND HIS HAD BEEN THE MOST DEVOTED LOVE AS USUAL HIS LETTERS WERE FORWARDED TO HIM FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN LONDON
YOU SPEAK OF GUILTY PERSONS HE SAID AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THOSE GUILTY PERSONS IS MY BROTHER MISSUS LINLEY ADVANCED A STEP AND TOOK THE PARASOL FROM THE TABLE
TO MAKE A COMPLICATED STATEMENT IN FEW WORDS PERMIT ME TO SEIZE THE POINTS IN THE LATE MISTER PRESTY'S STYLE AND TO PUT THEM IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT THIS PLACE RANDAL IS ALWAYS FULL AND WE DIDN'T WRITE LONG ENOUGH BEFOREHAND TO SECURE ROOMS
HIS WIFE ADDED WILL YOU ASK HER TO COME TO ME MISSUS PRESTY KNEW HER DAUGHTER'S NATURE MISSUS PRESTY HAD BEEN WAITING NEAR AT HAND IN EXPECTATION OF THE MESSAGE WHICH SHE NOW RECEIVED TENDERLY AND RESPECTFULLY
MISTER ROMSEY WAS ONE OF THEM HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SAID QUIETLY WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I KNOW MORE OF MISSUS NORMAN THAN YOU DO I HAVE HEARD OF HER
BENNYDECK LET THE MATTER REST THERE STRUCK BY THE REMARKABLE APPEARANCE OF EMBARRASSMENT IN MISSUS PRESTY'S MANNER AND FEELING IN SPITE OF HERBERT'S POLITENESS OF LANGUAGE
WE PASSED EACH OTHER IN THE HALL OF THE HOTEL AT SANDYSEAL YOU HAD A YOUNG WOMAN WITH YOU YOUR MEMORY IS A BETTER ONE THAN MINE SIR I FAIL TO REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO WHICH YOU REFER
WHO WERE NOT IN THE SECRET WAS THE ONE FEELING IN COMMON WHICH HER FATHER'S CORRESPONDENTS PRESENTED IN MERCY TO HIS MEMORY SHE THREW THE LETTERS INTO THE EMPTY FIREPLACE AND DESTROYED THEM BY BURNING
COULD TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MISTER AND MISSUS LINLEY IN THIS INTERVAL MISSUS PRESTY SAW HER OPPORTUNITY OF SETTING LINLEY'S AUTHORITY AT DEFIANCE BY ROUSING THE FIRST JEALOUS SUSPICION
YOU WILL STAY AND HAVE DINNER TOO WON'T YOU RANDAL PROMISED TO DINE WITH KITTY WHEN THEY MET IN LONDON BEFORE HE LEFT THE ROOM HE POINTED TO HIS CARD ON THE TABLE LET MY FRIEND SEE THAT MESSAGE HE SAID AS HE WENT OUT
AT THE SAME MOMENT RANDAL SEIZED HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING
TO ARRIVE AT THIS CONCLUSION AND TO RECOMMEND A VISIT TO SANDYSEAL WERE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER MEDICALLY SPEAKING AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN
DOES WHAT YOU WISH TO SAY TO ME RELATE ONLY TO YOURSELF IT RELATES TO ANOTHER PERSON AS WELL AS TO MYSELF THAT REPLY AND THE INFERENCE TO WHICH IT LED TRIED CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION
SHE ANSWERED NOTHING NOTHING MISSUS PRESTY REPEATED WITH AN IRONICAL ASSUMPTION OF INTEREST THE WORK OF ALL OTHERS CATHERINE THAT I MOST WANT TO READ SHE SNATCHED UP THE BOOK OPENED IT AT THE FIRST PAGE
AS SHE HATED HIM AT THAT MOMENT THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION HE HAD HIS REASONS HE SAID FOR HESITATING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO PRESENT HIMSELF UNINVITED
AND WITH NO FALTERING TONE IN HER VOICE IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE WAS OUT IN THE STREET
ONCE MORE SHE CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SPITE OF HERSELF SHE CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN HER HUSBAND AND SYDNEY WESTERFIELD TOGETHER IN THE SHRUBBERY AND SYDNEY CRYING
AND CHERISH AND THEN EVEN THEN URGED BY HIS OWN SELF TORMENTING SUSPICION HE LOOKED FOR MORE ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE THERE WAS A LEADING ARTICLE
CATHERINE'S HEAD SANK ON HER BOSOM HER HELPLESS HANDS LAY TREMBLING ON HER LAP OVERPOWERED BY THE CONFESSION WHICH SHE HAD JUST HEARD
THAT GENEROUS WOMAN HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ONE AND BUT ONE CONCEALMENT OF THE TRUTH IN RELATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE ELOPEMENT FROM MOUNT MORVEN HAD TAKEN PLACE SHE HAD ABSTAINED
ON THE TOILET TABLE THREE PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAITS SHOWED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BRUSHES AND COMBS
RECOGNITION OF THE WOMAN WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE NEITHER MOVED NOR SPOKE STRAINED TO THEIR UTMOST POINT OF TENSION CATHERINE'S NERVES QUIVERED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT SHADOWY SOLITARY FIGURE
IN HONOR OF AN INTERESTING DOMESTIC EVENT HER HUSBAND ABSENT ON THE CONTINENT FOR SOME TIME PAST ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HIS FIRM HAD RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND HAD THAT EVENING
MISTER ROMSEY AGREED WITH HIS WIFE ON GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY NEVER MAKE A ROW IF YOU CAN HELP IT WAS THE PEACEABLE PRINCIPLE TO WHICH THIS GENTLEMAN COMMITTED HIMSELF
THE MOMENT THE DOOR HAD CLOSED ON HIM MISSUS PRESTY STARTLED HER DAUGHTER BY TAKING UP THE CARD AND LOOKING AT WHAT RANDAL HAD WRITTEN ON IT IT ISN'T A LETTER CATHERINE AND YOU KNOW HOW SUPERIOR I AM TO COMMON PREJUDICES
BEFORE HERBERT RETURNED HE WAS FOLLOWED BY SYDNEY WESTERFIELD THE GOVERNESS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HER HEAD SANK ON HER BREAST HER QUICK CONVULSIVE BREATHING
FROM TIME TO TIME LONG AFTERWARD WHEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD GOT THE CLEW IN OUR HANDS I CONTINUED MY INQUIRIES STILL WITHOUT SUCCESS
MISSUS LINLEY FOLLOWED HER DAUGHTER AND INNOCENTLY PLACED A FATAL OBSTACLE IN MISSUS PRESTY'S WAY BY LEAVING THE ROOM
AND TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION IN A MOMENT MORE THE REMEMBRANCE OF MISSUS LINLEY CHECKED HER SHE WENT BACK TO HER BED CHAMBER THE PRESENTS THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SINCE HER ARRIVAL AT MOUNT MORVEN
SHE ANSWERED MISPLACED SENTIMENT MISSUS PRESTY DECLARED
AND A STOREHOUSE FOR ROPES AND COALS BEYOND THESE OBJECTS THERE WAS NOTHING AND THIS WAS THE GREAT CHARM OF THE PLACE TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF INVALIDS FOLLOWING THE DOCTOR'S DIRECTIONS AND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
THE WRITER CONFIDED TO HIM HER SAD STORY LEAVING IT TO HER FATHER'S FRIEND TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE WAS WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHY WHICH HE HAD OFFERED TO HER WHEN HE THOUGHT SHE WAS A STRANGER
I HAVE INTERRUPTED A CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEW HE BEGAN AND I OUGHT PERHAPS TO EXPLAIN MISSUS PRESTY LISTENED ABSENTLY PREOCCUPIED BY THE FEAR THAT HERBERT WOULD PROVOKE A DANGEROUS DISCLOSURE
I HAVE A GREAT MIND TO KEEP THIS SHE SAID TO KITTY TILL YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VALUE IT PROPERLY
WILL YOU TELL THE DONKEY BOY TO MAKE HIM GALLOP
OH GOD HOW CAN I GIVE THAT WOMAN BACK THE HAPPINESS OF WHICH I HAVE ROBBED HER THE COMPOSING INFLUENCE OF PRAYER ON A TROUBLED MIND WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE HAD HEARD OF IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE EXPERIENCED NOW
I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO LEAVE HIM IF HE HAD LOVED ME AS HE ONCE LOVED YOU MISS WESTERFIELD YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON LIVING WHO OUGHT TO ALLUDE TO MY MARRIED LIFE
I OWN THAT I COME FROM MISS WESTERFIELD HE ANSWERED SHE ADDRESSES A REQUEST TO YOU THROUGH ME I REFUSE TO GRANT IT HEAR IT FIRST NO HEAR IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME CATHERINE SAW HER CHILD TREMBLING AT THE SIGHT OF HER BEFORE THAT DISCOVERY THE EMOTIONS THAT SHOOK HER UNDER THE INSULT WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED LOST THEIR HOLD
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERVIEW SHE ALLOWED THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT TO LEAD HER ASTRAY IN HER EAGERNESS TO COMPLETE THE ACT OF ATONEMENT
HAD GREATLY IMPROVED THE FAMOUS AIR HAD AGREED WITH THEM AND THE DISCOVERY OF NEW PLAYFELLOWS HAD AGREED WITH THEM THEY HAD MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH LADY MYRIE'S WELL BRED BOYS AND WITH MISSUS NORMAN'S CHARMING LITTLE KITTY
IT WAS SO WARM TO A HALF STARVED CHILD AND I ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN I WAS THERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HERBERT
HIS LORDSHIP DECLARED THAT HE HAD A GREAT MIND NOT TO GRANT THE DIVORCE AT ALL HE SPOKE OF THIS DREADFUL WOMAN WHO HAS DECEIVED US IN THE SEVEREST TERMS HE SAID
KITTY SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR HER LEGS WOULD SUPPORT HER NO LONGER I THINK I SHALL FAINT SHE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL LAUGHTER SYDNEY SILENTLY PLACED A NEW TOY
CATHERINE LOOKED AT HER AND RELENTED THE NOBLE NATURE WHICH COULD STOOP TO ANGER BUT NEVER SINK TO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF MALICE AND PERSECUTION RESTRAINED ITSELF AND MADE AMENDS
IS THERE ANOTHER WOMAN IN THE WORLD LIKE YOU HE EXCLAIMED MANY OTHER WOMEN SHE ANSWERED FIRMLY A VULGAR TERMAGANT FEELING A SENSE OF INJURY
THE LUMBER TAKEN AWAY AND A NICE LITTLE BED IN ONE CORNER SOME CLERK IN THE CITY HAD TAKEN THE ROOM I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT AGAIN BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SURPRISE WAITING FOR ME A HAPPY SURPRISE THIS TIME
NO HONEST EMPLOYMENT WOULD BE BENEATH MY NOTICE BESIDES IF I WENT TO AMERICA I MIGHT MEET WITH MY BROTHER MY DEAR CHILD AFTER THE TIME THAT HAS PASSED THERE IS NO IMAGINABLE CHANCE OF YOUR MEETING WITH YOUR BROTHER
HE COULD ONLY SAY WHAT WE HAVE ALL SAID HOW SINCERELY HOW SORROWFULLY WE ALL KNOW THE COMMON WORD GOOD BY THE COMMON WISH GOD BLESS YOU AT THAT LAST MOMENT
AND CATHERINE HAS THE VILE CREATURE WHOM YOUR BROTHER PICKED UP IN LONDON TO THANK FOR IT NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME LESS THAN EVER RANDAL ANSWERED UNLESS YOU HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES
SET RESTRAINT AT DEFIANCE MY DAUGHTER'S MARRIED LIFE IS A WRECK SHE BURST OUT POINTING THEATRICALLY TO THE DOOR BY WHICH LINLEY AND SYDNEY WESTERFIELD HAD RETIRED
OF HIS STILL HOLDING HIMSELF BOUND BY HIS MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE
AFTER SACRIFICING ALL THAT MAKES LIFE TRULY DECENT AND TRULY ENJOYABLE FOR A WOMAN HE HAS GOT NOTHING NOT EVEN FALSE HAPPINESS IN RETURN
IN STEERING THE PERAMBULATOR IN A STRAIGHT COURSE THAT SHE FORGOT HER UNCLE AND THE PARASOL ONLY WAITING TO REMIND HER HUSBAND AND SYDNEY THAT THEY WERE WASTING THE BEAUTIFUL SUMMER MORNING INDOORS
INVITED TO REST HERSELF IN THE HOTEL SHE ASKED LEAVE TO REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS THE MERE EFFORT OF RISING WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER NOW CATHERINE SAID THE PARTING WORDS KINDLY I BELIEVE IN YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS
OR DYING IN THE WORKHOUSE THE FERVID SPIRIT IN HER THAT HAD NEVER KNOWN A MOTHER'S LOVING DISCIPLINE NEVER THRILLED TO THE SYMPATHY OF A SISTER FRIEND
HEARING WHAT RANDAL SAID SHE PAUSED WONDERING AT THE STRANGE ALLUSION TO HER HUSBAND IN THE MEANWHILE MISSUS PRESTY ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO HER YES SHE SAID TO RANDAL
SHE PUSHED THE PARCEL UNDER THE PILLOW AND INSTEAD OF SAYING GOOD NIGHT TOOK A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN
WHEN THAT WOMAN HAS SUFFERED BENNYDECK CONSOLED INTERESTED CHARMED SYDNEY BY STILL SPEAKING OF THE BYGONE DAYS AT HOME
IN WHAT OFFENDED ME AT THE TIME IF YOU FELT STRONGLY IT WAS FOR MY SAKE I WISH TO BEG YOUR PARDON I WAS HASTY I WAS WRONG ON AN OCCASION WHEN SHE HAD FIRST IRRITATED AND THEN SURPRISED HIM
YOU ARE AS GOOD AS A FATHER TO THOSE LOST DAUGHTERS OF YOURS IF YOU GIVE THEM A SISTER FRIEND SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SET THEM A GOOD EXAMPLE

THE LARGEST NATURE THE LONGEST LOVE MISSUS PRESTY WAITED IN THE GARDEN TO BE JOINED BY HER DAUGHTER AND CAPTAIN BENNYDECK AND WAITED IN VAIN IT WAS PAST HER GRANDCHILD'S BEDTIME
ANSWERS THIS QUESTION AND TELLS A VERY SAD STORY IN DEFERENCE TO MY MOTHER'S WISHES IT WAS KEPT STRICTLY A SECRET FROM ME WHILE MY FATHER LIVED THERE WAS A YOUNGER SISTER OF MY MOTHER'S WHO WAS THE BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY
I SHALL NOT STIR FROM THIS PLACE TILL YOU HAVE EXPLAINED YOURSELF WAS THE FIRM REPLY THE SERVANT LED THE WAY OUT HE CROSSED THE PASSAGE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF A WAITING ROOM

THAT THE DESERTED CREATURE WHOM HE HAD MET IN THE GARDEN THE STRANGER TO WHOM HE HAD OFFERED HELP AND CONSOLATION IN THE PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE WAS NO OTHER THAN THE LOST GIRL
I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AH IT WAS A MELANCHOLY MEETING FOR BOTH OF US
THE CHILD REMINDED HER OF THE LIVING FATHER STILL THE CHILD INNOCENTLY TORTURED HER WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DECEIT THE FAITHLESS MAN FROM WHOM THE LAW HAD RELEASED HER

THAN WAKE THE WILL AND BE BORN BITTERLY
SIX NOW ERE I SLEEP I WONDER WHAT I SHALL DREAM SOME SENSE OF BEING UTTER NEW MAY COME INTO MY SOUL WHILE I AM BLIND AND DUMB WITH SHAPES AND AIRS AND SCENTS
EVEN THOU CANST GIVE ME NEITHER THOUGHT NOR THING WERE IT THE PRICELESS PEARL HID IN THE LAND WHICH IF I FIX THEREON A GREEDY GAZE BECOMES NOT POISON THAT DOTH BURN AND CLING
BUT WALKEST CROWNED CREATION'S HEART AND BLOOM SIX MY GOD WHEN I WOULD LIFT MY HEART TO THEE IMAGINATION INSTANTLY DOTH SET A CLOUDY SOMETHING THIN AND VAST AND VAGUE
THE LITTLE CHILD THAT CLAMOURING FAILS TO REACH WITH UPSTRETCHED HAND THE FRINGE OF HER ATTIRE YET MEETS THE MOTHER'S HAND DOWN HURRYING
THAT THOU ART NEARER NOW THAN WHEN EYE SEEN ON EARTH
I SHOULD NO MORE SHRINK FROM IT THAN FROM THE BREATH THAT MAKES IN THE FROSTY AIR A NIMBUS SHROUD THOU LOVE HAST CONQUERED DEATH AND I ALOUD SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER HIM
AND STRENGTH TO HANG WITH NAILS UPON THY CROSS SEVEN IF THOU HADST CLOSED MY LIFE IN SEED AND HUSK AND CAST ME INTO SOFT WARM DAMP DARK MOULD
THEREFORE THE MORE WITH MARY AT THY FEET I MUST SIT WORSHIPPING THAT IN MY CORE THY WORDS MAY FAN TO A FLAME THE LOW PRIMEVAL HEAT FOURTEEN

TO LIFT THY SOULS ALOFT IN FAITHFUL GODHEAD FREE

WHICH DARK HOURS TEEM OF OTHER SORT THAN THOSE THAT HAUNT THE DAY HINTING AT PRECIOUS THINGS AGES AWAY IN THE LONG TALE OF US GOD TO HIMSELF DOTH SAY SEVEN
OUR SUFFERING SORE BY FAITH SHALL BE BEREFT OF ALL DISMAY AND EVERY WEAK EXCESS HIS PRESENCE SHALL BE BETTER IN OUR PAIN THAN EVEN SELF ABSENCE TO THE WEAKER BRAIN

THUS I WOULD SAY I WOULD BE AS THOU ART THUS I MUST SAY OR STILL I WORK ATHWART THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY AND LAW THAT DWELLS IN ME AND WILL ME ASUNDER DRAW IF IN OBEDIENCE I LEAVE ANY FLAW
I ALWAYS SEEM TO LEAVE SOME BETTER THING
MAKE MY FORGIVENESS DOWNRIGHT SUCH AS I SHOULD PERISH IF I DID NOT HAVE FROM THEE I LET THE WRONG GO WITHERED UP AND DRY CURSED WITH DIVINE FORGETFULNESS IN ME TIS BUT SELF PITY PLEASANT MEAN AND SLY
FREEDOM IS TO BE LIKE THEE FACE AND HEART TO KNOW IT LORD I MUST BE AS THOU ART I CANNOT BREED THE IMAGINATION HIGH
AND THERE THOU MOV'ST IN PATHS TO US UNKNOWN OUT OF STRANGE STRIFE THY PEACE IS STRANGELY WROUGHT IF THE LION IN US PRAY THOU ANSWEREST THE LAMB TWENTY SEVEN
SO COMMON ARE THY PATHS THY COMING SEEMS ONLY ANOTHER PHASE OFT OF MY ME BUT NEARER IS MY I O LORD TO THEE THAN IS MY I TO WHAT ITSELF IT DEEMS
TEN MIGHT I BUT SCATTER INTERFERING THINGS QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS DISTRUSTS AND ANXIOUS PRIDE AND IN THY GARMENT AS UNDER GATHERING WINGS
BACK STRAIGHTWAY INTO THIRSTFUL DREAMING SINKS SO TURNS MY WILL TO THEE FOR THEE STILL LONGS STILL PINES TWENTY FOUR THE MORTAL MAN ALL CAREFUL WISE AND TROUBLED
AND HENCE IT COMES THAT THOU AT TIMES DOST SEEM TO FADE INTO AN IMAGE OF MY MIND I DREAMER COVER HIDE THEE UP WITH DREAM THEE PRIMAL INDIVIDUAL ENTITY NO LIKENESS WILL I SEEK TO FRAME OR FIND
TO SOME A BITTER SORROW TO SOME THE STING OF LOVE MISPRIZED OF SICK ABANDONING TO SOME A FROZEN HEART OH WORSE THAN ANYTHING
NOTHING CAN DRAW THE HEART OF MAN BUT GOOD LOW GOOD IT IS THAT DRAWS HIM FROM THE HIGHER SO EVIL POISON UNCREATE FROM FOOD NEVER A FOUL THING WITH TEMPTATION DIRE TEMPTS HELLWARD FORCE CREATED TO ASPIRE
WILL BE LOVE AWFUL IN MY SIGHT AND OPEN TO THE ETERNAL MORNING'S MIGHT EACH HUMAN FACE WILL SHINE MY WINDOW FOR THY LIGHT THIRTEEN
WHATE'ER I BE I CRY AND WILL NOT CEASE LET ME NOT PERISH THOUGH FAVOUR BE NOT MEET FIFTEEN FOR WHAT I SEEK THOU KNOWEST I MUST FIND
THOU KNOW'ST HOW VERY HARD IT IS TO BE HOW HARD TO ROUSE FAINT WILL NOT YET REVIVING TO DO THE PURE THING TRUSTING ALL TO THEE TO HOLD THOU ART THERE FOR ALL NO FACE WE SEE
YEA THAN THE BLUE OF HEAVEN THAT EVER FLEES US YET SIMPLE AS THE CRY OF SORE HURT CHILD OR AS HIS SHOUT WITH SUDDEN GLADNESS WILD WHEN HOME FROM SCHOOL HE RUNS TILL MORN SET FREE
I AM BUT AS A BEAST BEFORE THEE LORD GREAT POET KING I THANK THEE FOR THE WORD LEAVE NOT THY SON HALF MADE IN BEASTLY GUISE
THE WORSE I DROP THAT I THE BETTER FIND THE BEST IS ONLY IN THY PERFECT MIND FALLEN THREADS
YEA ONLY THERE IT BURNS WITH ANY FLAME
TIS HARD FOR MAN TO ROUSE HIS SPIRIT UP IT IS THE HUMAN CREATIVE AGONY THOUGH BUT TO HOLD THE HEART AN EMPTY CUP OR TIGHTEN ON THE TEAM THE RIGID REIN MANY WILL RATHER LIE AMONG THE SLAIN THAN CREEP THROUGH NARROW WAYS THE LIGHT TO GAIN
THEY GATHER EACH A CRUMB OH THE DEAF PEOPLE WOULD THEY WERE ALSO DUMB HEAR HOW THEY TALK AND LACK OF CHRIST DEPLORE STAMPING WITH MUDDY FEET ABOUT THE DOOR AND WILL NOT WIPE THEM CLEAN TO WALK UPON HIS FLOOR
SHE YET WILL SOMETIMES MISS THE MOTHER'S FOLDING ARMS THE MOTHER'S SEALING KISS TWENTY NINE THEN FIRST I THINK OUR ELDEST BORN ALTHOUGH LOVING DEVOTED TENDER WATCHFUL DEAR
IN MY BEST TIMES I LONG AFTER THY WILL AND THINK IT GLORIOUS DEAR EVEN IN MY WORST PERFORCE MY WILL TO THINE IS BENT
BUT NOW THE SPIRIT AND I ARE ONE IN THIS MY HUNGER NOW IS AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS MY SPIRIT HOPES IN GOD TO SET ME FREE FROM THE LOW SELF LOATHED OF THE HIGHER ME GREAT ELDER BROTHER OF MY SECOND BIRTH
OUR LIFE IS THE BROKEN CURRENT LORD OF THINE FLASHING FROM MORN TO MORN WITH CONSCIOUS SHINE THEN FIRST BY WILLING DEATH SELF MADE THEN LIFE DIVINE EIGHTEEN
MY FANCY SHRINKS FROM LEAST OF ALL THY HARMS BUT DO THY WILL WITH ME I AM THINE OWN
ORDERING ALL THINGS IN THY POTENT WILL SILENT AND THINKING EVER TO THY FATHER WHOSE THOUGHT THROUGH THEE FLOWS MULTITUDINOUS OR SHALL I THINK OF THEE AS JOURNEYING RATHER
TO TRUST IS GAIN AND GROWTH NOT MERE SOWN SEED FAITH HEAVES THE WORLD ROUND TO THE HEAVENLY DAWN
WHICH ELSE HAD RESTED DUMB BEFORE THE NEIGHBOUR'S TRUTH DELIGHTED EYES IN THE GREAT
I KNOW NOT HOW FOR THAT I FIRST MUST KNOW THEE I KNOW I KNOW THEE NOT AS I WOULD KNOW THEE FOR MY HEART BURNS LIKE THEIRS THAT DID NOT KNOW HIM TILL HE BROKE BREAD AND THEREIN THEY MUST KNOW HIM
O LORD WHEN I DO THINK OF MY DEPARTED I THINK OF THEE WHO ART THE DEATH OF PARTING OF HIM WHO CRYING FATHER BREATHED HIS LAST THEN RADIANT FROM THE SEPULCHRE UPSTARTED
NOR TO MY FOWLING NET WILL ONE RETURN IS THE THING EVER OURS WE CANNOT KEEP BUT THEIR SOULS GO NOT OUT INTO THE DEEP WHAT MATTER IF WITH CHANGED SONG THEY COME BACK
THE WORD HE THEN DID SPEAK FITS NOW AS THEN FOR THE SAME KIND OF MEN DOTH MOCK AT IT GOD FOOLS GOD DRUNKARDS THESE DO CALL THE MEN WHO THINK THE POVERTY OF THEIR ALL NOT FIT BORNE HUMBLY BY THEIR ART THEIR VOICE THEIR PEN
LIFE GIVING LOVE ROTS TO DEVOURING FIRE JUSTICE CORRUPTS TO DESPICABLE REVENGE MOTHERHOOD CHOKES IN THE DAM'S JEALOUS MIRE HUNGER FOR GROWTH TURNS FLUCTUATING CHANGE LOVE'S ANGER GRAND GROWS SPITEFUL HUMAN WRATH
NESTLE OBEDIENT TO THY LOVING SIDE EASY IT WERE TO LOVE THEE BUT WHEN THOU SEND'ST ME TO THINK AND LABOUR FROM THEE WIDE LOVE FALLS TO ASKING MANY A WHY AND HOW ELEVEN
BUT I MUST KNOW THEE IN A DEEPER WAY THAN ANY OF THESE WAYS OR KNOW THEE NOT MY HEART AT PEACE FAR LOFTIER PROOF MUST LAY THAN IF THE WIND THOU ME THE WAVE DIDST ROLL THAN IF I LAY BEFORE THEE A SUNNY SPOT
TO SHARE IN THE OUTGOING WILL THAT LIVES AND IS BECAUSE OUTGOING STILL TEN I AM LOST BEFORE THEE FATHER YET I WILL CLAIM OF THEE MY BIRTHRIGHT INEFFABLE
ISABEL RETURNED DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A FALSE POSITION HER COMPANIONS EVIDENTLY HAD LOST THEMSELVES MY BROTHER'S POSITION MISS MOLYNEUX ENQUIRED
YOU CAN'T DO SO IF YOUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BY IRRELEVANT GOSSIP HIS OWN CONVERSATION
SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
NODDED GOOD NIGHT AND WITHDREW ACCOMPANIED BY HER AUNT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS MOTHER THOUGH HE THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOVE STAIRS THE TWO LADIES SEPARATED AT MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR ISABEL HAD SAID NOTHING ON HER WAY UP
AND TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION AT A LOW TEMPERATURE THE POOR GIRL LIKED TO BE THOUGHT CLEVER BUT SHE HATED TO BE THOUGHT BOOKISH
MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
DON'T SIT ALONE WITH THE GENTLEMEN LATE AT NIGHT YOU WERE VERY RIGHT TO TELL ME THEN SAID ISABEL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M VERY GLAD TO KNOW IT I SHALL ALWAYS TELL YOU HER AUNT ANSWERED WHENEVER I SEE YOU TAKING WHAT SEEMS TO ME TOO MUCH LIBERTY
MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
AS REGARDS THAT SAID ISABEL I SHOULD FIND IN MY OWN NATION ENTERTAINMENT FOR A LIFETIME BUT WE'VE A LONG DRIVE AND MY AUNT WILL SOON WISH TO START SHE TURNED BACK
THE RESULT WAS KALEIDOSCOPIC
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
YOU'RE SO GOOD AS TO HAVE A THEORY ABOUT ME
HAD THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THINKING ALL THE OTHERS AESTHETIC VULGARIANS
THERE HAD REALLY BEEN A CHANGE IN HER LIFE
ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
IT APPEARED TO ISABEL THAT THE UNPLEASANT HAD BEEN EVEN TOO ABSENT FROM HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SHE HAD GATHERED FROM HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE THAT IT WAS OFTEN A SOURCE OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
OF REQUESTING YOUR ATTENTION WHICH IT REWARDED ACCORDING TO THE CHARM YOU FOUND IN BLUE EYES OF REMARKABLE FIXEDNESS THE EYES OF A COMPLEXION OTHER THAN HIS OWN AND A JAW OF THE SOMEWHAT ANGULAR MOULD WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BESPEAK RESOLUTION
EXCEPT THAT SHE'S SO ORIGINAL WELL I DON'T LIKE ORIGINALS I LIKE TRANSLATIONS MISTER LUDLOW HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPLIED
ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT BESPOKE RESOLUTION TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF WHICH IN HALF AN HOUR CASPAR GOODWOOD WHO HAD ARRIVED HOPEFUL AS WELL AS RESOLUTE TOOK HIS WAY BACK TO HIS LODGING WITH THE FEELING OF A MAN DEFEATED
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE YOUR MIND MISS ARCHER HER COMPANION DECLARED IT'S ALREADY A MOST FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENT IT LOOKS DOWN ON US ALL IT DESPISES US DESPISES YOU YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME
BUT THE DEPTHS OF THIS YOUNG LADY'S NATURE WERE A VERY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE BETWEEN WHICH AND THE SURFACE COMMUNICATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY A DOZEN CAPRICIOUS FORCES
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
SAID MISS MOLYNEUX FINDING HER VOICE YES AND THE OTHER PLACES WHAT ARE THEY CALLED
WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
THEY HAD BEEN CALLED ENCHANTING I CAN'T HELP IT ISABEL ANSWERED I THINK IT'S LOVELY TO BE SO QUIET AND REASONABLE AND SATISFIED I SHOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE THAT HEAVEN FORBID CRIED RALPH WITH ARDOUR
THINKING HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN OF HER TIME HAD PRONOUNCED THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE RULE I HAVE HINTED AT A FOOLISH PERIOD OF HISTORY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
YOU DON'T OF NECESSITY LOSE BY THAT IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY SO BUT EVEN IF I GAIN STERN JUSTICE IS NOT WHAT I MOST LOVE IS MISSUS TOUCHETT GOING TO TAKE YOU ABROAD I HOPE SO
MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
AS TO WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN COMMITTED THE CONSCIOUS SOLECISM OF FORGIVING THEM MUCH BAD PAINTING FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUBJECT WHILE THE CIVIL WAR WENT ON SHE WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE PASSED MONTHS OF THIS LONG PERIOD IN A STATE OF
A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
AND THE AGITATIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS FOND OF SEEING GREAT CROWDS AND LARGE STRETCHES OF COUNTRY OF READING ABOUT REVOLUTIONS AND WARS OF LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PICTURES A CLASS OF EFFORTS
I CAN'T FANCY HIS GIVING UP HIS PROPERTY SAID MISS MOLYNEUX AH
ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
DON'T QUESTION YOUR CONSCIENCE SO MUCH IT WILL GET OUT OF TUNE LIKE A STRUMMED PIANO KEEP IT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS DON'T TRY SO MUCH TO FORM YOUR CHARACTER IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PULL OPEN A TIGHT TENDER YOUNG ROSE
DO YOU MEAN DO YOU MEAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXPENSE THE YOUNGER ONE ASKED I DARE SAY HE MIGHT LET ONE OR TWO OF HIS HOUSES SAID THE OTHER LET THEM FOR NOTHING ISABEL DEMANDED
AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
RISING FROM A BROAD STILL MOAT IT AFFECTED THE YOUNG VISITOR AS A CASTLE IN A LEGEND THE DAY WAS COOL AND RATHER LUSTRELESS THE FIRST NOTE OF AUTUMN HAD BEEN STRUCK
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
ISABEL LIKED THEM EVEN BETTER AT HOME THAN SHE HAD DONE AT GARDENCOURT AND WAS MORE THAN EVER STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT MORBID IT HAD SEEMED TO HER BEFORE THAT
WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
WAS LORD WARBURTON SUDDENLY TURNING ROMANTIC
AND HER SISTER ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY I'VE NEVER KEPT UP WITH ISABEL
LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
I MUST TAKE IT AS I FIND IT CAN'T I STAY WITH MY OWN COUSIN ISABEL ENQUIRED I'M NOT AWARE THAT LORD WARBURTON IS YOUR COUSIN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO TO BED THE VISITOR SUGGESTED THAT WILL ARRANGE IT
AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
WAS INDEED QUITE A SPLENDID YOUNG MAN HE INSPIRED HER WITH A SENTIMENT OF HIGH OF RARE RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER FELT EQUALLY MOVED TO IT BY ANY OTHER PERSON HE WAS SUPPOSED BY THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO WISH TO MARRY HER
EXPRESSLY TO SEE HER HAVING LEARNED IN THE FORMER CITY WHERE HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS AND WHERE HE HAD HOPED TO FIND HER THAT SHE WAS STILL AT THE STATE CAPITAL
WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
THAT IT WAS ALTOGETHER A PAINFUL ONE NEVERTHELESS SHE MADE ANSWER TO HIS DECLARATION COLDLY ENOUGH JUST AS YOU PLEASE
OF THE CHOREOGRAPHIC CIRCLE HER SISTER
IN WHICH THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING AS ONE LIKED APPEARED TO INCREASE AS ONE GREW OLDER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY MODIFIED BY THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM HIS CLEVER HIS SUPERIOR HIS REMARKABLE GIRL LATER WHEN THE JOURNEYS TO EUROPE CEASED
THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
IT DOESN'T DESERVE AN ANSWER I WANT TO SEE AS MANY COUNTRIES AS I CAN THEN YOU'LL GO ON JUDGING I SUPPOSE
SHE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE WOULD COME IN
AS THE TWO WERE MAKING READY FOR THEIR VISIT I DO HOPE IMMENSELY SHE'LL DO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR ISABEL SHE HAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER WHAT IS IT YOU WISH HER TO DO EDMUND LUDLOW ASKED
AND SHE SAID AS GAILY AS POSSIBLE AND AS QUICKLY AS AN APPRECIABLE DEGREE OF AGITATION WOULD ALLOW HER I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO PROSPECT OF MY BEING ABLE TO COME HERE AGAIN NEVER SAID LORD WARBURTON
BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
HER FATHER HAD A LARGE WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE OF WHICH HIS RESTLESSNESS AND EVEN HIS OCCASIONAL INCOHERENCY OF CONDUCT HAD BEEN ONLY A PROOF
LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
MY DEAR FRIEND I WONDER IF YOU'RE GROWING FAITHLESS FAITHLESS FAITHLESS TO YOU HENRIETTA NO THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PAIN BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAITHLESS TO MY COUNTRY THEN
BUT LORD WARBURTON EXERCISED SOME INGENUITY IN ENGAGING HIS LEAST FAMILIAR GUEST IN A STROLL APART FROM THE OTHERS I WISH YOU TO SEE THE PLACE PROPERLY SERIOUSLY HE SAID
ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
SO VERY MUCH MORE FETCHING
I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LET ME BRING YOU OVER TO MY CONVICTION MY REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS HOPE HAD BEEN OF THE BEST BUT YOU DISAPPOINTED IT I FOUND YOU CHANGED
THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
SHE PERCEIVED AFTERWARDS IT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL IN A WILDERNESS OF FADED
A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
IMPOSSIBLE MY LIEGE EXCLAIMED SUFFOLK WHY SO I THOUGHT CRIED HENRY AND I TURNED A DEAF EAR TO ALL INSINUATIONS THROWN OUT AGAINST HER TILL PROOF WAS AFFORDED WHICH I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT
I BESEECH YOU TO CONSIDER WELL BEFORE YOU RAISE ANNE BOLEYN TO THE THRONE IN GIVING YOU THIS COUNSEL I KNOW I HAZARD THE FAVOUR I HAVE JUST REGAINED BUT EVEN AT THAT HAZARD
UNAVAILING I GRIEVE TO HEAR IT MY LIEGE REPLIED WOLSEY HEAVING A DEEP SIGH IT IS AN ILL OMENED UNION AND WILL BRING WOE TO YOU WOE TO YOUR REALM AND WOE TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
PLACING HIS PAWS UPON HIS MASTER'S KNEES THE NEAREST TURNSPIT TOOK THE CAKE IN HIS MOUTH AND PROCEEDING TOWARDS NOB BROKE IT INTO TWO PIECES AND PUSHED THE LARGER PORTION TOWARDS HIM WHILE MABEL WAS ADMIRING THIS DISPLAY OF SAGACITY AND AFFECTION
YOU DARE NOT BRAVE MY POWER AND YOU ARE RIGHT CRIED HERNE A WAVE OF MY HAND WOULD BRING THIS OLD TOWER ABOUT YOUR EARS A WORD WOULD SUMMON A LEGION OF FIENDS TO TORMENT YOU BUT DO NOT UTTER IT I PRAY YOU GOOD HERNE EXCELLENT HERNE CRIED MAT BEE
AND SCREENED BY AN EMBATTLED AND TURRETED STRUCTURE CONSTITUTING A COVERED WAY TO THE ROUND TOWER ARRIVED AT THE LANDING THE OFFICER UNLOCKED A DOOR ON THE LEFT AND USHERED HIS COMPANION INTO THE PRISONER'S CHAMBER
I HAVE NO FEAR REPLIED SURREY AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A SLIGHT NOISE IN THAT PART OF THE CHAMBER WHICH WAS BURIED IN DARKNESS HAVE WE A LISTENER HERE CRIED WYAT GRASPING HIS SWORD
HOW TIMES ARE CHANGED SINCE I BRYAN BOWNTANCE FIRST STEPPED INTO MY FATHER'S SHOES AND BECAME HOST OF THE GARTER IT WAS IN FIFTEEN O ONE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN KING HENRY THE SEVENTH
HAD ISSUED FROM THE HOSTEL AND JOINED THE EARL AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER AFTER THE CROWD IN A FEW MINUTES THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH REACHED HENRY THE EIGHTH'S GATE WHERE HE SHOUTED TO A SENTINEL AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
THE THOUGHT IS MADNESS I WILL NOT OBEY THE HATEFUL MANDATE I WILL STAY AND DEFY HIM AS HE UTTERED ALOUD THIS WILD AND UNGUARDED SPEECH THE ARRAS SCREENING THE DOOR WAS DRAWN ASIDE
BUT I WILL CAST YOU OFF WILL CRUSH YOU AS I WOULD THE NOXIOUS REPTILE AND HE STAMPED UPON THE FLOOR AS IF HE COULD HAVE TRAMPLED THE CARDINAL BENEATH HIS FOOT
I WILL EXPLAIN MY ERRAND AS WE GO I HAD SOME THOUGHT OF SENDING YOU THERE IN MY STEAD HA HE EXCLAIMED GLANCING AT HIS FINGER BY SAINT PAUL IT IS GONE WHAT IS GONE MY LIEGE ASKED SUFFOLK MY SIGNET REPLIED HENRY
WYAT'S OWN GIFT TO HER IN HAPPIER DAYS
SO IMMERSED WAS THE YOUTHFUL PRISONER IN STUDY THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE UNTIL A SLIGHT EXCLAMATION WAS UTTERED BY WYAT OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE LATTER HE THEN AROSE AND GAVE HIM WELCOME
I REPEAT YOU HAVE DONE ME A SERVICE REJOINED THE EARL I WOULD LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR MY FAIR COUSIN ANNE BOLEYN AND I AM GLAD TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF MY REGARD FOR YOU WYAT
HEEDLESS OF ALL IMPEDIMENTS HE PRESSED FORWARD NOW DASHING BENEATH OVERHANGING BOUGHS AT THE RISK OF HIS NECK NOW SKIRTING THE EDGE OF A GLEN WHERE A FALSE STEP MIGHT HAVE PROVED FATAL
UPON THIS I SEIZED A HAMMER WHICH WAS LYING BY AND SOUNDED THE CASKS BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMING EMPTY I AT LAST BROKE THE LID OF ONE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT CONTAINED
BUT I FANCY I CAN DISCERN THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR ULTIMATE DECISION WILL BE TAKEN BUT IT IS NOW NEAR MIDNIGHT I WISH YOUR MAJESTY SOUND AND UNTROUBLED REPOSE STAY CRIED HENRY I AM ABOUT TO VISIT THE CURFEW TOWER AND MUST TAKE YOU WITH ME
BUT I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH TO PLACE YOUR LIFE IN MY POWER SO YOU REFUSE TO OBEY THE KING'S INJUNCTIONS YOU REFUSE TO PROCEED TO PARIS YOU REFUSE TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT THE DIVORCE
THE ABSENT ARE ALWAYS IN DANGER AND FEW WOMEN ARE PROOF AGAINST AMBITION VANITY VANITY IS THE ROCK THEY SPLIT UPON MAY YOU NEVER EXPERIENCE FROM RICHMOND THE WRONG I HAVE EXPERIENCED FROM HIS FATHER
CREDIT HIM NOT MY MASTERS
AND THAT THEY SAW A LEGION OF DEMONS MOUNTED ON COAL BLACK HORSES AND AMONGST THEM MARK FYTTON THE BUTCHER WHO WAS HANGED A FEW DAYS AGO FROM THE CURFEW TOWER BY THE KING'S ORDER AND WHOSE BODY SO STRANGELY DISAPPEARED
ASTROLOGY AND ALCHEMY AND WHO WAS A CONSTANT ATTENDANT ON HENRY AT THE HEAD OF THE BENCH ON THE RIGHT OF THE TABLE SAT WILL SOMMERS THE JESTER WAS NOT PARTAKING OF THE REPAST BUT WAS CHATTING WITH SIMON QUANDEN THE CHIEF COOK
AND A FIRE IN YOUR EYE SUCH AS I NEVER BEFORE OBSERVED IN YOU OR IN MORTAL MAN I TREMBLE TO SAY IT BUT YOU LOOK LIKE ONE POSSESSED BY THE FIEND FORGIVE MY BOLDNESS SIR I SPEAK FROM AFFECTION AND DUTY
I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TO HENRY'S LAWLESS PASSION MEANWHILE HERNE HAD PASSED INTO ONE OF THE LARGE EMBRASURES AND OPENED BY MEANS OF A SPRING AN ENTRANCE TO A SECRET STAIRCASE IN THE WALL HE THEN BECKONED TRISTRAM TOWARDS HIM AND WHISPERED SOME INSTRUCTIONS IN HIS EAR
I HOPE YOUR WORSHIP IS NOT ABOUT TO RIDE INTO THE FOREST AT THAT HOUR SAID ADAM TREMBLING I WAS TOLD BY THE STOUT ARCHER WHOM THE KING DUBBED DUKE OF SHOREDITCH THAT HE AND THE DUKE OF RICHMOND VENTURED THITHER LAST NIGHT
AND GET FLOUTED FOR THY PAINS BY THE LADY ANNE SAID KIT COO THE DAMSEL IS NOT SO COMELY AS I EXPECTED TO FIND HER OBSERVED AMICE LOVEKYN ONE OF THE SERVING WOMEN TO HECTOR CUTBEARD THE CLERK OF THE KITCHEN
I MISSED IT NOT TILL NOW IT HAS BEEN WRESTED FROM ME BY THE FIEND DURING MY WALK FROM THE CURFEW TOWER LET US NOT LOSE A MOMENT OR THE PRISONERS WILL BE SET FREE BY HIM IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN LIBERATED ALREADY SO SAYING HE TOOK A COUPLE OF DAGS
PLEAD ILL HEALTH WITH THE KING IN EXCUSE OF YOUR MISSION TO FRANCE AND RETIRE FOR SOME MONTHS TO RECRUIT YOUR STRENGTH AND SPIRITS AT ALLINGTON TUSH ADAM TWISDEN I AM WELL ENOUGH EXCLAIMED WYAT IMPATIENTLY
WYAT STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND AND GRASPED THAT OF THE DEMON HIS FINGERS WERE COMPRESSED AS IF BY A VICE AND HE FELT HIMSELF DRAGGED TOWARDS THE TREE WHILE A STIFLING AND SULPHUROUS VAPOUR ROSE AROUND HIM
AND HE BEHELD HENRY AND ANNE BOLEYN ENTER IT PRECEDED BY A BAND OF ATTENDANTS BEARING TAPERS IT NEEDED NOT WYAT'S JEALOUSY SHARPENED GAZE TO READ EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE THE KING'S ENAMOURED LOOKS
SUFFOLK I FEEL SHE DOES NOT LOVE ME EXCLUSIVELY AND MY PASSION IS SO DEEP AND DEVOURING THAT IT DEMANDS ENTIRE RETURN I MUST HAVE HER HEART AS WELL AS HER PERSON AND I FEEL I HAVE ONLY WON HER IN MY QUALITY OF KING
AND THERE'S NO HARM I TRUST IN CALLING HIM SO MARRY IS THERE NOT MINE HOST CRIED THE FOREMOST ATTENDANT I SPOKE OF HIM AS SUCH IN HIS OWN HEARING NOT LONG AGO AND HE LAUGHED AT ME
WYAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE STARTING EXPERIENCED A SENSATION OF DOUBT AND DREAD AND THE WARNING OF HIS OLD AND FAITHFUL ATTENDANT RUSHED UPON HIS MIND HE TRIED TO RECITE A PRAYER BUT THE WORDS DIED AWAY ON HIS LIPS
BUT I HERE SOLEMNLY VOW NEVER TO GIVE MY HAND TO YOU TILL WOLSEY IS DISMISSED FROM YOUR COUNSELS ANNE EXCLAIMED THE KING MY OWN ENMITY I COULD FOREGO PURSUED ANNE VEHEMENTLY BUT I CANNOT FORGIVE HIM
ALL SENTIMENTS OF LOVE AND LOYALTY ARE SWALLOWED UP BY JEALOUSY AND BURNING HATE NOTHING BUT BLOOD CAN ALLAY THE FEVER THAT CONSUMES ME SHOW ME HOW TO SLAY HIM HIM ECHOED THE CARDINAL IN ALARM AND HORROR
NO WOLSEY REPLIED HENRY TAKING A HASTY TURN ACROSS THE CHAMBER NO CONSIDERATIONS OF INTERESTS OR SECURITY SHALL INDUCE ME TO GIVE UP ANNE I LOVE HER TOO WELL FOR THAT
LIKE A SEA BIRD IN A STORM AND HOOTING BODINGLY AS IT WINGED ITS MYSTIC FLIGHT NO OTHER SOUND WAS HEARD NOR LIVING OBJECT SEEN WHILE GAZING INTO THE DREARY EXPANSE BENEATH HIM
AND IF HE HAD NOT BEEN INVULNERABLE THE BULLET MUST HAVE PIERCED HIS BRAIN I HEARD IT REBOUND FROM HIS HORNED HELMET AND DROP TO THE FLOOR SAID BOUCHIER WHAT IS THAT CHEST CRIED HENRY POINTING TO A STRANGE COFFIN SHAPED BOX LYING AS IT SEEMED ON THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE DEMON HAD DISAPPEARED
AND I AM SURE OF YOUR THANKS HEREAFTER WELL
DECLARE AS MUCH TO MY ENEMIES SIRE AND I SHALL BE MORE CONTENT YOU WILL FIND THE PALACE BETTER WORTH ACCEPTANCE THAN AT FIRST SIGHT MIGHT APPEAR HOW SO CRIED THE KING YOUR HIGHNESS WILL BE PLEASED TO TAKE
NOW BEGAN TO MANIFEST SYMPTOMS OF ALARM QUIVERED IN EVERY LIMB SNORTED AND REQUIRED TO BE DRAGGED ALONG FORCIBLY WHEN WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE TREE ITS ENORMOUS RIFTED TRUNK BECAME FULLY REVEALED TO HIM
TO LIFT MY HAND AGAINST THE KING BUT I NEVER COULD HAVE INJURED HER YOU ARE A MADMAN CRIED WOLSEY IMPATIENTLY AND IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO ARGUE WITH YOU I WISH YOU GOOD SPEED ON YOUR JOURNEY
HE SANK THROUGH THE FLOOR AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW GONE EXCLAIMED HENRY AS THE SMOKE CLEARED OFF GONE HOLY MARY THEN IT MUST INDEED BE THE FIEND I MADE THE MIDDLE OF HIS SKULL MY AIM
AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT ADMIT WOLSEY TO YOUR SECRET COUNSELS YOU ARE HIS ENEMY SUFFOLK SAID THE KING STERNLY I AM YOUR MAJESTY'S FRIEND REPLIED THE DUKE I BESEECH YOU YIELD TO ME ON THIS OCCASION
AND WITH NO IMPROPER BOLDNESS I SAY IT YOUR FRIEND BUT I DEFY THE ENEMIES WHO HAVE POISONED YOUR EARS AGAINST ME TO PROVE THAT I HAVE EVER ABUSED THE TRUST PLACED IN ME THE SOLE FAULT THAT CAN BE IMPUTED TO ME IS
SOON AFTER THIS THE OFFICER APPEARED AND AT ONCE ACCORDING WYAT PERMISSION TO SEE THE EARL PRECEDED HIM UP THE LONG FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS COMMUNICATING WITH THE UPPER PART OF THE KEEP
SHE HAS JUST RIDDEN FORTH WITH THE KING TO HAWK IN THE PARK REPLIED WYAT MOODILY FOR MYSELF L AM ORDERED ON A MISSION TO FRANCE BUT I COULD NOT DEPART WITHOUT ENTREATING YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR THE JEOPARDY IN WHICH I HAVE PLACED YOU
WITH MARK BEFORE THE LATTER COULD STRIKE A BLOW GRAPPLED WITH HIM AND HELD HIM FAST TILL HE WAS SECURED AND HIS ARMS TIED BEHIND HIM AND SO IT IS YOU MORGAN FENWOLF
BUT NO FORCE WAS REQUIRED FOR THE LID WAS NOT NAILED DOWN AND WHEN IT WAS REMOVED A HUMAN BODY IN THE LAST STAGE OF DECAY WAS DISCOVERED PAH CLOSE IT UP CRIED HENRY TURNING AWAY IN DISGUST HOW CAME IT THERE
WYAT HAD TO REMAIN WITHOUT TILL HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE WHILE THUS DETAINED HE BEHELD ANNE BOLEYN AND HER ROYAL LOVER MOUNT THEIR STEEDS IN THE UPPER WARD AND RIDE FORTH WITH THEIR ATTENDANTS ON A HAWKING EXPEDITION
LIGHTED BY A GREAT WINDOW AT THE LOWER END THIS WAS THE ROYAL KITCHEN AND IN IT YAWNED NO FEWER THAN SEVEN HUGE ARCHED FIREPLACES IN WHICH FIRES WERE BURNING AND BEFORE WHICH VARIOUS GOODLY JOINTS WERE BEING ROASTED
THE AFFRIGHTED ANIMAL BROKE ITS HOLD AND DARTED OFF INTO THE SWAMP WHERE IT FLOUNDERED AND WAS LOST YOU HAVE CALLED ME SIR THOMAS WYAT
BEFORE RETURNING TO THE STATE APARTMENTS HENRY TOOK A TURN ON THE RAMPARTS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CASTLE BETWEEN THE CURFEW TOWER AND THE WINCHESTER TOWER
AND WORE A HIGH CONICAL CAP ON ITS HEAD BEFORE WYAT COULD SPEAK THE FIGURE ADDRESSED HIM YOU DESIRE TO SEE HERNE THE HUNTER SAID THE FIGURE IN A DEEP SEPULCHRAL TONE
WHAT SHALL IT BE SWEETHEART WE HAVE A WELL STORED LARDER HERE YOU HAVE ONLY TO ASK AND HAVE I THANK YOU BUT I AM IN WANT OF NOTHING REPLIED MABEL
THE ROOF OF WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF STOUT PLANKS CROSSED BY HEAVY OAKEN RAFTERS AND SUPPORTED BY BEAMS OF THE SAME MATERIAL ON THE LEFT A STEEP LADDER LIKE FLIGHT OF WOODEN STEPS LED TO AN UPPER ROOM
I AM PERSUADED YOUR MAJESTY IS MISTAKEN SAID THE DUKE WOULD I COULD THINK SO SIGHED HENRY BUT NO NO I CANNOT BE DECEIVED I WILL CONQUER THIS FATAL PASSION OH SUFFOLK
BESEECH YOU CALM YOURSELF MY LIEGE REPLIED WOLSEY IN THE SOFT AND DEPRECATORY TONE WHICH HE HAD SELDOM KNOWN TO FAIL WITH THE KING I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF MY OWN AGGRANDISEMENT BUT AS IT WAS LIKELY TO ADVANCE YOUR POWER
INFLUENCED BY THE CIRCULAR SHAPE OF THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH IT WAS SITUATED AND OF WHICH IT FORMED A SEGMENT THE FARTHER PART OF THIS CHAMBER WAS ALMOST LOST TO VIEW
LAUGHING CRIED SIMON QUANDEN HOLDING HIS FAT SIDES AND ADDRESSING HIS SPOUSE WHO WAS LEANING UPON HIS SHOULDER IN THE MEANTIME PATCH SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GESTICULATING WITH RAGE AND FURY CRIED
HEAVING A DEEP SIGH HE THEN AROSE AND PACED THE CHAMBER WITH RAPID STRIDES YES IT IS BETTER THUS HE EJACULATED IF I REMAIN NEAR HER I SHALL DO SOME DESPERATE DEED BETTER
HENRY YOU KNOW THE SOLE TERMS ON WHICH YOU CAN PROCURE MY HAND THE KING NODDED A PLAYFUL AFFIRMATIVE THEN DISMISS HIM AT ONCE DISGRACE HIM SAID ANNE NAY NAY REPLIED HENRY
AY SOLID BARS OF GOLD INGOTS
I WILL DRINK THE HEALTH OF KING HENRY'S LAWFUL CONSORT
THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE AN INVENTION HIS GRACE HAS NO SUCH TREASURE THE TRUTH IS WILL SOMMERS GOT DRUNK UPON SOME CHOICE MALMSEY AND THEN DREAMED HE HAD BEEN BROACHING CASKS OF GOLD
FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND HIS COMPANIONS DREW THEIR SWORDS AND WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY FALLEN UPON THE STURDY OFFENDER IF MORGAN FENWOLF WHO WITH THE EARL OF SURREY WAS STANDING AMONG THE SPECTATORS HAD NOT RUSHED FORWARD AND CLOSING
HIS APPEARANCE WAS WELCOMED BY A JOYFUL SHOUT FROM THE ATTENDANTS COME MY MASTERS HE CRIED FILLING THE HORN HERE IS A CUP OF STOUT WINDSOR ALE IN WHICH TO DRINK THE HEALTH OF OUR JOLLY MONARCH BLUFF KING HAL
BUT THE BELL HAD SCARCELY SOUNDED WHEN THE CORD SEVERED FROM ABOVE FELL UPON HIS HEAD AT THIS JUNCTURE THE KING AND THE DUKE OF SUFFOLK ARRIVED WHEN TOLD WHAT HAD HAPPENED THOUGH PREPARED FOR IT HENRY BURST INTO A TERRIBLE PASSION AND BESTOWED A BUFFET ON MAT BEE
A PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER SUPERFLUOUS AS THE HAMMERING HAD RECOMMENCED AND CONTINUED TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE WHEN IT STOPPED JUST THEN IT OCCURRED TO MAT BEE TO RING THE ALARM BELL AND HE SEIZED THE ROPE AND BEGAN TO PULL IT
HEED NOT WHAT THE VILLAIN SAYS MY GOOD FELLOW SAID THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH YOU HAVE CAPTURED HIM BRAVELY AND I WILL TAKE CARE YOUR CONDUCT IS DULY REPORTED TO HIS MAJESTY TO THE CASTLE WITH HIM TO THE CASTLE
OR TO THE STATE APARTMENTS TRACKING IT FOR SOME TIME NICHOLAS CLAMP AT LENGTH TURNED OFF ON THE RIGHT AND CROSSING A SORT OF ANTE ROOM
WYAT RETURNED NO ANSWER HE SEEMED LOST IN GLOOMY THOUGHT AND SOON AFTERWARDS TOOK HIS LEAVE ON RETURNING TO HIS LODGINGS HE SUMMONED HIS ATTENDANTS AND ORDERED THEM TO PROCEED TO KINGSTON ADDING THAT HE WOULD JOIN THEM THERE
I WISH SUCH ANOTHER CHANCE OF CAPTURING THE FIEND WOULD OCCUR TO ME AS THE WORDS WERE UTTERED THE DOOR OF A RECESS WAS THROWN SUDDENLY OPEN AND HERNE IN HIS WILD GARB WITH HIS ANTLERED HELM UPON HIS BROW AND THE RUSTY CHAIN DEPENDING FROM HIS LEFT ARM STOOD BEFORE THEM
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING ONE OF THEM AN OLD SERVING MAN NOTICING THE EXCEEDING HAGGARDNESS OF HIS LOOKS ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO WITH THEM BUT WYAT WITH A HARSHNESS TOTALLY UNLIKE HIS CUSTOMARY MANNER
AND A HUGE INDISTINCT BLACK MASS ALONE POINTED OUT THE POSITION OF THE HAUNTED TREE AROUND IT WHEELED A LARGE WHITE OWL DISTINGUISHABLE BY ITS GHOSTLY PLUMAGE THROUGH THE GLOOM
WHO WAS RUSHING IN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE PERSON THUS EJECTED WHO WAS A POWERFULLY BUILT YOUNG MAN IN A LEATHERN DOUBLET WITH HIS MUSCULAR ARMS BARED TO THE SHOULDER
THEY TELL ME MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN IS COMING TO WINDSOR WITH THE KING AND THE KNIGHTS COMPANIONS TO MORROW IS IT SO ASKED THE HOST AGAIN FILLING THE HORN AND HANDING IT TO ANOTHER ATTENDANT
AND CLOSELY QUESTIONED HER WHETHER THE EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE HAD NOT BEEN OCCASIONED BY SOME IMPRUDENCE OF HER OWN BUT SHE POSITIVELY DENIED THE CHARGE ALLEGING THAT SHE HAD PARTED WITH THE KING SCARCELY AN HOUR BEFORE ON TERMS OF THE MOST PERFECT AMITY
COME HE ADDED SNATCHING A TORCH FROM AN ARQUEBUSIER AND DRAWING HIS DAG HE HURRIED UP THE STEEP STEPS WHILE SUFFOLK FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
I HAVE NOT YET TOLD THE KING MY MASTER OF THE RARE WINE WE FOUND IN HIS CELLAR WHAT WINE WAS THAT WILL CRIED JACK OF THE BOTTLES YOU SHALL HEAR REPLIED WILL SOMMERS ENJOYING THE DISCONCERTED LOOK OF THE OTHER JESTER I WAS AT THE PALACE AT HAMPTON
HIS JESTER HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE DISCOVERY JUST MADE OF THE SECRET HOARD AND HE WAS THEREFORE COMPELLED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THIS DESPERATE MOVE BUT I WAS APPRIZED OF HIS INTENTIONS BY WILL SOMMERS AND HAVE COME IN TIME TO FOIL HIM
AND THE EARL PROCEEDED TO DETAIL WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THE DUKE IN THE FOREST A MARVELLOUS STORY TRULY SAID WYAT PONDERING UPON THE RELATION I WILL SEEK OUT THE DEMON HUNTSMAN MYSELF
OR SENT YOU BY SOME FOREIGN POTENTATE HA IT IS WINE THAT A KING MIGHT PRIZE REPLIED THE CARDINAL YOUR MAJESTY WILL FIND A HUNDRED HOGSHEADS IN THAT CELLAR AND EACH HOGSHEAD FILLED WITH GOLD YOU
OR THAT TIBBY WAS NOT INTERESTED IN CURRANT PLANTATIONS HE NEVER NOTICED THE LIGHTS AND SHADES THAT EXIST IN THE GRAYEST CONVERSATION THE FINGER POSTS THE MILESTONES THE COLLISIONS THE ILLIMITABLE VIEWS
THEY WERE SHE SAW IT CLEARLY JOURNALISM HER FATHER WITH ALL HIS DEFECTS AND WRONG HEADEDNESS HAD BEEN LITERATURE AND HAD HE LIVED HE WOULD HAVE PERSUADED HIS DAUGHTER RIGHTLY THE REGISTRY OFFICE WAS HOLDING ITS MORNING RECEPTION
DAY AFTER DAY THE SUN RETREATS INTO THE WELSH MOUNTAINS AND THE TOWER CHIMES SEE THE CONQUERING HERO BUT THE WILCOXES HAVE NO PART IN THE PLACE NOR IN ANY PLACE
THEY MIGHT BY CONTINUAL CHATTER LEAD HELEN INTO A REPETITION OF THE DESIRES OF JUNE INTO A REPETITION THEY COULD NOT DO MORE THEY COULD NOT LEAD HER INTO LASTING LOVE
HER BROTHER GAVE HER AWAY HER AUNT WHO WAS OUT OF HEALTH PRESIDED OVER A FEW COLOURLESS REFRESHMENTS THE WILCOXES WERE REPRESENTED BY CHARLES WHO WITNESSED THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
PIGS TEETH AND YOU CHEW THE BARK FOR TOOTHACHE WHAT A RUM NOTION OF COURSE NOT
WE WERE ALL MODERATELY CIVIL AND COLLECTED THOUGH I HAD MY SUSPICIONS I GAVE THEM YOUR MESSAGE AND MISSUS WILCOX SAID OH YES I SEE YES IN THAT WAY OF HERS NOTHING ELSE
THE WAVES WERE COLOURLESS AND THE BOURNEMOUTH STEAMER GAVE A FURTHER TOUCH OF INSIPIDITY DRAWN UP AGAINST THE PIER AND HOOTING WILDLY FOR EXCURSIONISTS
NO MARGARET MOST RUDE IN EITHER CASE ONE CAN CLASS IT AS REASSURING MISSUS MUNT SIGHED SHE WAS GOING BACK TO SWANAGE ON THE MORROW JUST AS HER NIECES WERE WANTING HER MOST
THE ROADS OF HIS SOUL LIE CLEAR AND HE AND HIS FRIENDS SHALL FIND EASY GOING IT WAS HARD GOING IN THE ROADS OF MISTER WILCOX'S SOUL FROM BOYHOOD HE HAD NEGLECTED THEM
MISTER WILCOX WAS NOT SORRY THAT THE MEETING FAILED HELEN LEFT HIM TIME TO GROW SKIN OVER HIS WOUND THERE WERE STILL MOMENTS WHEN IT PAINED HIM HAD HE ONLY KNOWN THAT MARGARET WAS AWAITING HIM MARGARET SO LIVELY AND INTELLIGENT
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING BY MIDSUMMER THE SUN SHONE THROUGH DIRT WITH AN ADMIRED OBSCURITY TO SPEAK AGAINST LONDON IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE THE EARTH AS AN ARTISTIC CULT HAS HAD ITS DAY
IN PRACTICE THERE WILL BE THINGS MAY BE DONE FOR WHICH NO MONEY CAN COMPENSATE
RUTH POOR OLD RUTH DID NOT ENTER INTO HIS CALCULATIONS AT ALL FOR POOR OLD RUTH HAD NEVER FOUND HIM OUT HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS PRESENT WIFE GREW STEADILY HER CLEVERNESS GAVE HIM NO TROUBLE
SHE MADE A FALSE START WITH THE WILCOXES AND SHE'LL BE AS WILLING AS WE ARE TO HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM FOR A CLEVER GIRL DEAR HOW VERY ODDLY YOU DO TALK
AND NEEDN'T HAVE STARTED LIFE ELSEWHERE AT A GREATLY REDUCED SALARY HE ONLY SAYS REDUCED CORRECTED MARGARET SEEING TROUBLE AHEAD WITH A MAN SO POOR EVERY REDUCTION MUST BE GREAT I CONSIDER IT A DEPLORABLE MISFORTUNE
AND VERY COMMON HE LOOKED IN A TALL HAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIS BACK WAS TURNED TO HER AND THOUGH SHE HAD CUT HIS BACK SHE COULD NOT REGARD THIS AS A TELLING SNUB BUT YOU WILL BE CAREFUL WON'T YOU SHE EXHORTED
AND AS FAST AS OUR POUNDS CRUMBLE AWAY INTO THE SEA THEY ARE RENEWED FROM THE SEA YES FROM THE SEA AND ALL OUR THOUGHTS ARE THE THOUGHTS OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDERS AND ALL OUR SPEECHES
HELEN'LL HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO DO WITH THEM NOW THAT THEY'RE ALL OPPOSITE SHE MAY MEET THAT PAUL IN THE STREET SHE CANNOT VERY WELL NOT BOW OF COURSE SHE MUST BOW BUT LOOK HERE LET'S DO THE FLOWERS
WELL WOULD YOU BE VERY KIND WOULD YOU COME ROUND WITH ME TO THE REGISTRY OFFICE THERE'S A HOUSEMAID WHO WON'T SAY YES BUT DOESN'T SAY NO ON THEIR WAY THITHER THEY TOO LOOKED UP AT THE WILCOXES FLAT
HE WAS NOT ENTERING THE HALL IN FACT HE DID NOT ENTER IT FOR QUITE FIVE MINUTES BUT FRIEDA DETECTED A DELICATE SITUATION AND SAID THAT SHE AND HELEN HAD MUCH BETTER WAIT FOR BRUNO DOWN BELOW
YES YES YES SAFE AS HOUSES SAFER VERY MANY THANKS I'M SORRY IF YOU SUBLET IF HE SUBLETS I SHAN'T HAVE THE SAME CONTROL
BUT TIBBY ACCEPTED THE OFFER GLADLY IT SAVED HIM FROM COMING TO ANY DECISION ABOUT THE FUTURE THE PLATE AND THE MORE VALUABLE PICTURES FOUND A SAFER HOME IN LONDON BUT THE BULK OF THE THINGS WENT COUNTRY WAYS AND WERE ENTRUSTED TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MISS AVERY
HE HAD A SAD MOUSTACHE BUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WAS YOUNG I HAVE HAD A LETTER TOO NOT A NICE ONE I WANT TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU FOR LEONARD BAST WAS NOTHING TO HIM NOW THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM HER WORD
AND IT'S ALMOST THE SAME ROOM ONE EVENING THEY MAY FORGET TO DRAW THEIR BLINDS DOWN AND YOU'LL SEE THEM AND THE NEXT YOU YOURS AND THEY'LL SEE YOU IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT OUT ON THE BALCONIES
HAS VERY LITTLE FAITH IN THE CONTINENT AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE ALL TAKEN AFTER HIM ON WHAT GROUNDS DO THEY FEEL THAT THE CONTINENT IS IN BAD FORM MISSUS WILCOX HAD NO IDEA SHE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO GROUNDS
SHE WILL FEEL DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD OF COURSE SAID NOTHING ABOUT MISSUS BAST BUT I CANNOT LET THIS KIND OF THING CONTINUE WITHOUT COMMENT I AM MORALLY CERTAIN THAT SHE IS WITH HER SISTER AT HOWARDS END
MARGARET HAD HEARD A CERTAIN RUMOUR BUT WAS ALL RIGHT
I SAY HOW CAN YOU GUESS THE TEMPTATIONS THAT LIE ROUND A MAN IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US SAID MARGARET BUT IF WE ARE WORTH MARRYING WE DO GUESS
OTHER REGRETS CROWDED UPON HER FOR INSTANCE HOW MAGNIFICENTLY SHE WOULD HAVE CUT CHARLES IF SHE HAD MET HIM FACE TO FACE SHE HAD ALREADY SEEN HIM GIVING AN ORDER TO THE PORTER
AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
WITH THE PASSION WITHOUT IT WE ARE MEANINGLESS FRAGMENTS HALF MONKS HALF BEASTS UNCONNECTED ARCHES THAT HAVE NEVER JOINED INTO A MAN WITH IT LOVE IS BORN
SAID TIBBY FAINTLY AND LEANT SO FAR BACK IN HIS CHAIR THAT HE EXTENDED IN A HORIZONTAL LINE FROM KNEES TO THROAT AND DON'T THINK I'M NOT SERIOUS BECAUSE I DON'T USE THE TRADITIONAL ARGUMENTS
VERY MUCH I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
IT OUGHT TO KEEP THE PUBLIC INFORMED STAGE BY STAGE THE PORPHYRION ACCORDING TO YOU WAS BOUND TO SAY I AM TRYING ALL I CAN TO GET INTO THE TARIFF RING
GOOD GOD NO HE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY NATURAL
WANT CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ACTIVITY WHICH I EXPECT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN THE OTHER PLACE
I DIDN'T SAY POINT ME OUT A TIME WHEN DESIRE FOR EQUALITY HAS MADE THEM HAPPIER NO NO YOU CAN'T
AND THE LITERATURE OF THE NEAR FUTURE WILL PROBABLY IGNORE THE COUNTRY AND SEEK INSPIRATION FROM THE TOWN ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE REACTION OF PAN AND THE ELEMENTAL FORCES THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
BENEATH THEM WAS THE BOURGEOIS LITTLE BAY
THAT WAY LIES MADNESS THANK GOODNESS SHE TOO HAD SOME MONEY AND COULD PURCHASE A NEW HOME TIBBY NOW IN HIS SECOND YEAR AT OXFORD WAS DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION AND MARGARET TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING A SERIOUS TALK WITH HIM
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
THAT'S MORE LIKE SOCIALISM SAID MISSUS MUNT SUSPICIOUSLY CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE I CALL IT GOING THROUGH LIFE WITH ONE'S HAND SPREAD OPEN ON THE TABLE I'M TIRED OF THESE RICH PEOPLE WHO PRETEND TO BE POOR
I NEVER FOLLOW ANY ARGUMENTS I AM ONLY TOO THANKFUL NOT TO HAVE A VOTE MYSELF
OH CERTAINLY FIENDISHLY CAREFUL AND HELEN MUST BE CAREFUL TOO CAREFUL OVER WHAT CRIED HELEN AT THAT MOMENT COMING INTO THE ROOM WITH HER COUSIN NOTHING SAID MARGARET SEIZED WITH A MOMENTARY AWKWARDNESS
WILL YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE STRONGEST MAN
NOR IN THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN JOURNALISM AND LITERATURE WHICH WAS STARTED AS A CONVERSATIONAL HARE THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE DARTED AFTER IT WITH CRIES OF JOY MARGARET LEADING THEM
SHE WAS ONLY OVER WROUGHT AS WHO WOULD NOT BE
IT ISN'T FRITTERING AWAY THE STRENGTH SHE PROTESTED IT'S ENLARGING THE SPACE IN WHICH YOU MAY BE STRONG HE ANSWERED YOU'RE A CLEVER LITTLE WOMAN BUT MY MOTTO'S CONCENTRATE
AND THE SERVANTS TO HUMANIZE AND SEVERAL KETTLES OF HELEN'S TO KEEP ON THE BOIL HER CONSCIENCE PRICKED HER A LITTLE ABOUT THE BASTS SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THEM NO DOUBT LEONARD WAS WORTH HELPING BUT BEING HENRY'S WIFE SHE PREFERRED TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE
TO HAVE NO ILLUSIONS AND YET TO LOVE WHAT STRONGER SURETY CAN A WOMAN FIND SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND'S PAST AS WELL AS HIS HEART SHE KNEW HER OWN HEART WITH A THOROUGHNESS THAT COMMONPLACE PEOPLE BELIEVE IMPOSSIBLE
YOU HAVE EVEN MET THE FELLOW HE IS VERY POOR AND HIS WIFE IS AN EXTRAVAGANT IMBECILE HE IS CAPABLE OF BETTER THINGS WE WE THE UPPER CLASSES THOUGHT WE WOULD HELP HIM FROM THE HEIGHT OF OUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
WHAT TO DO WHY TO INQUIRE HE SWAGGERED UP TO IT TRAGICALLY AND SOUNDED A PEAL MARGARET POURED HERSELF OUT SOME COFFEE THE BUTLER CAME AND SAID THAT MISS SCHLEGEL HAD SLEPT AT THE GEORGE SO FAR AS HE HAD HEARD
AND MONTH BY MONTH THE ROADS SMELT MORE STRONGLY OF PETROL AND WERE MORE DIFFICULT TO CROSS AND HUMAN BEINGS HEARD EACH OTHER SPEAK WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY BREATHED LESS OF THE AIR AND SAW LESS OF THE SKY NATURE WITHDREW
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
WHAT MAN I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT HIS NAME WAS BAST MY GOD IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MISTER WILCOX IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE CHARLES IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE I KNOW PATER
AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF POLITE BEWILDERMENT HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE HER KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURE SLIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEW ENGLISH ART CLUB
THERE WAS A PETULANT TOUCH ABOUT HIM MORE LIKE A WOMAN COULD IT BE THAT HE WAS GROWING OLD THE WILCOXES WERE NOT LACKING IN AFFECTION THEY HAD IT ROYALLY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT IT WAS THE TALENT IN THE NAPKIN AND
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
I PROMISED TO TELL YOU WITH HER LOVE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GERMANY WITH HER SISTER THIS EVENING THAT WAS ALL WE HAD TIME FOR MISTER WILCOX SEEMED RELIEVED
RENDERS WAR A LITTLE MORE LIKELY EACH TIME THAT IT IS MADE AND IS THEREFORE MADE THE MORE READILY BY THE GUTTER PRESS OF EITHER NATION HAVE THE PRIVATE EMOTIONS ALSO THEIR GUTTER PRESS MARGARET THOUGHT SO
SHE PUT A HAND ON EITHER SHOULDER
THE HOUSE IS MINE AND CHARLES IT WILL BE YOURS
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE GRANGE IS ON CLAY AND BUILT WHERE THE CASTLE MOAT MUST HAVE BEEN
AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
AND ALL THE THINGS AND PEOPLE FOR WHOM HE HAD NEVER HAD MUCH USE AND HAD LESS NOW THEIR MEMORY HAMPERED HIM HE COULD SCARCELY ATTEND TO MARGARET WHO BROUGHT BACK DISQUIETING NEWS FROM THE GEORGE HELEN AND HER CLIENTS HAD GONE
BECAUSE HER THOUGHT DREW BEING FROM THE OBSCURE BORDERLAND SHE COULD NOT EXPLAIN IN SO MANY WORDS BUT SHE FELT THAT THOSE WHO PREPARE FOR ALL THE EMERGENCIES OF LIFE BEFOREHAND MAY EQUIP THEMSELVES AT THE EXPENSE OF JOY
THEY WENT INTO BREAKFAST
A PLEASANT ENOUGH FATE THE HOUSE BEING ONLY A LITTLE LARGER THAN WICKHAM PLACE TRAINED HER FOR THE IMMENSE ESTABLISHMENT THAT WAS PROMISED IN THE SPRING THEY WERE FREQUENTLY AWAY BUT AT HOME LIFE RAN FAIRLY REGULARLY IN THE MORNING HENRY WENT TO THE BUSINESS
THE HEART OF MISSUS WILCOX WAS ALONE HIDDEN AND PERHAPS IT IS SUPERSTITIOUS TO SPECULATE ON THE FEELINGS OF THE DEAD THEY WERE MARRIED QUIETLY REALLY QUIETLY FOR AS THE DAY APPROACHED SHE REFUSED TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONITON
IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
BECAUSE I'D SOONER RISK IT WAS HER LAME CONCLUSION BUT IMAGINE THE EVENINGS EXCLAIMED HER AUNT POINTING TO THE MANSIONS WITH THE SPOUT OF THE WATERING CAN
I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS TO LIVE THERE I WON'T HAVE IT HE LOOKED ANGRILY AT THE MOON TO MY MIND THIS QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY ITSELF
FOR RICHES HURRAH FOR RICHES FOR RICHES ECHOED MISSUS MUNT HAVING AS IT WERE AT LAST SECURED HER NUT YES FOR RICHES MONEY FOR EVER SO AM I AND SO I AM AFRAID ARE MOST OF MY ACQUAINTANCES AT SWANAGE
IT IS NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR AN EXAMINATION OR A DINNER PARTY OR A POSSIBLE FALL IN THE PRICE OF STOCK THOSE WHO ATTEMPT HUMAN RELATIONS MUST ADOPT ANOTHER METHOD OR FAIL
HER EYES GAZED TOO STRAIGHT THEY HAD READ BOOKS THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR MEN ONLY AND THOUGH HE HAD DREADED A SCENE AND THOUGH SHE HAD DETERMINED AGAINST ONE THERE WAS A SCENE ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMEHOW IMPERATIVE
OH AH YES
AND NOT TILL THE MEAL WAS HALF OVER DID THEY REALIZE THAT THE PRINCIPAL GUEST HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CHASE THERE WAS NO COMMON TOPIC MISSUS WILCOX WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE SERVICE OF HUSBAND AND SONS
HAD HE SUFFERED TORTURES OF REMORSE OR HAD IT BEEN THERE THAT'S OVER NOW FOR RESPECTABLE LIFE AGAIN THE LATTER IF SHE READ HIM RIGHTLY
I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
I SEE YOUR POINT SAID MARGARET GETTING UP IF ONITON IS REALLY DAMP IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND MUST BE INHABITED BY LITTLE BOYS ONLY IN THE SPRING LET US LOOK BEFORE WE LEAP
AND THROWS UPON PERSONAL RELATIONS A STRESS GREATER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BORNE BEFORE UNDER COSMOPOLITANISM IF IT COMES WE SHALL RECEIVE NO HELP FROM THE EARTH TREES AND MEADOWS AND MOUNTAINS WILL ONLY BE A SPECTACLE
THE PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNED THE FREEHOLD OF WICKHAM PLACE AND DESIRED TO ERECT BABYLONIAN FLATS UPON IT WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO STIR SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE QUIVERING JELLY HE WAS NOT A FOOL
I AM FAR FROM SURE THAT I SHALL GIVE HIM PERMISSION THERE WAS NO CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT IN MY OPINION SUBLETTING IS A MISTAKE IF HE CAN FIND ME ANOTHER TENANT WHOM I CONSIDER SUITABLE I MAY CANCEL THE AGREEMENT
I HAVE RELEASED YOU FROM YOUR ENGAGEMENT I COULD FIND EXCUSES BUT I WON'T NO I WON'T A THOUSAND TIMES NO I'M A BAD LOT AND MUST BE LEFT AT THAT EXPELLED FROM HIS OLD FORTRESS MISTER WILCOX WAS BUILDING A NEW ONE
SHE GAZED BACK WITH DEEP EMOTION UPON ONITON BESIDES THE GRANGE AND THE CASTLE KEEP SHE COULD NOW PICK OUT THE CHURCH AND THE BLACK AND WHITE GABLES OF THE GEORGE THERE WAS THE BRIDGE AND THE RIVER NIBBLING ITS GREEN PENINSULA
SUCH MEN GIVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN MANY WHO ARE BETTER EQUIPPED AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED REGULARLY AND HONESTLY SPARE ME THE WILCOXES HE MOANED
AS FOR THEATRES AND DISCUSSION SOCIETIES THEY ATTRACTED HER LESS AND LESS SHE BEGAN TO MISS NEW MOVEMENTS AND TO SPEND HER SPARE TIME RE READING OR THINKING RATHER TO THE CONCERN OF HER CHELSEA FRIENDS THEY ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE TO HER MARRIAGE
IT'S DEAD AND SHE'LL NEVER BE TROUBLED WITH IT AGAIN THE ONLY THINGS THAT MATTER ARE THE THINGS THAT INTEREST ONE BOWING EVEN CALLING AND LEAVING CARDS EVEN A DINNER PARTY WE CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS TO THE WILCOXES
WOULD SHE AGAIN FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY OF THE WILCOX FAMILY
AND THINK IT SHOWS A NICE MIND TO IGNORE THE PILES OF MONEY THAT KEEP THEIR FEET ABOVE THE WAVES I STAND EACH YEAR UPON SIX HUNDRED POUNDS AND HELEN UPON THE SAME AND TIBBY WILL STAND UPON EIGHT
A WISH THOUGH HE DID NOT EXPRESS IT THUS THAT HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO SAY I IN HIS YOUTH HE MEANT TO MAKE UP FOR MARGARET'S DEFECTION BUT KNEW THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH HER UNTIL YESTERDAY
A DOSE OF BUCKSHOT TO THE HEAD CLOSE TO THE EYE FROM BENITO STOPPED ONE OF THE MONSTERS
AND CECROPIAS IT ENTERS THE AMAZON BY FIVE MOUTHS HEREABOUTS ARAUJO THE PILOT MANAGED WITH GREAT EASE THE COURSE OF THE RIVER WAS BUT SLIGHTLY OBSTRUCTED WITH ISLANDS AND BESIDES
WITH ONLY LIGHT POLES SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF FOLIAGE THE AIR CIRCULATED FREELY THROUGHOUT THESE OPEN CONSTRUCTIONS AND SWUNG THE HAMMOCK SUSPENDED IN THE INTERIOR AND THE NATIVES AMONG WHOM WERE THREE OR FOUR COMPLETE FAMILIES WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN
NOT EVEN A CARRIAGE OF SHINING COPPER WITH RESPLENDENT LAMPS AND ORNAMENTED GLASS PANELS NOR A HUGE PARASOL NO ANYTHING WHATEVER TO IMPRESS THE PUBLIC AS THEY GENERALLY HAVE AT FAIRS NO BUT FRAGOSO HAD HIS CUP AND BALL
HAS NOT A SINGLE ISLAND NOR A SINGLE RAPID TO CHECK ITS COURSE THE MOUTH IS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET IN WIDTH AND THE RIVER COMES IN SOME MILES ABOVE THE SITE FORMERLY OCCUPIED BY THE TOWN OF THE SAME NAME
BY SPREADING OUT THE SAP ON A WOODEN SCOOP AND SHAKING IT IN THE SMOKE ITS COAGULATION IS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED IT ASSUMES A GRAYISH YELLOW TINGE AND SOLIDIFIES THE LAYERS FORMED IN SUCCESSION ARE DETACHED FROM THE SCOOP
THEY EVEN INTRUSTED THE YOUNG MERCHANT WITH A FEW PRODUCTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR HIM TO DISPOSE OF ON THEIR ACCOUNT AT MANAOS AND BELEM THE TOWN IS COMPOSED OF SOME SIXTY HOUSES ARRANGED ON THE PLAIN WHICH HEREABOUTS CROWNS THE RIVER BANK
IN A TONE OF THE MOST ROLLICKING GOOD HUMOR WHAT HE SAID WAS WHAT IS SAID BY ALL THE CHARLATANS WHO PLACE THEIR SERVICES AT THE PUBLIC DISPOSAL WHETHER THEY BE SPANISH FIGAROS OR FRENCH PERRUQIERS
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME OBVIOUSLY BUT THE INTERESTED OBSERVATION OF THE YOUNG DOCTOR RECEIVED NO ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE JOAM GARRAL THEN CALLED IN AN INDIAN WHO WAS THE PRINCIPAL MANAGER OF THE FAZENDA
IN THE BOW WAS THE CABIN OF THE PILOT WE SAY IN THE BOW AND NOT AT THE STERN WHERE THE HELMSMAN IS GENERALLY FOUND IN NAVIGATING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUDDER IS OF NO USE LONG OARS HAVE NO EFFECT ON A RAFT OF SUCH DIMENSIONS
THEY ARE VERY FOND OF IT THESE SAVAGES BOTH THE MEN AND THE WOMEN I SHALL NOT BE INSTALLED TEN MINUTES IN THE SQUARE AT TABATINGA WITH MY CUP AND BALL IN HAND THE CUP AND BALL I HAVE BROUGHT ON BOARD AND WHICH I CAN MANAGE WITH PRETTY PLEASANTLY BEFORE A CIRCLE OF BRAVES AND SQUAWS WILL HAVE FORMED AROUND ME
HAD ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION OF GOING ON ASHORE AND VISITING THE TOWN
HERE TORRES WITH CROSSED ARMS GAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY A LOOK OF INCONCEIVABLE INSOLENCE SO THAT IS YOU LAST WORD SAID HE
WHICH WITH THE DIFFERENT HABITATIONS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE CREW WOULD BECOME A VERITABLE FLOATING VILLAGE
AND THEY ADVANCED TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE JANGADA WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ASSEMBLED
THE SERVICE WAS WORKED BY INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT ALONE AND OFTEN THE BOATS WERE ONLY EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS OF THE RIVERSIDE ESTABLISHMENTS
WHICH IS DISTILLED FROM THE BOILED ROOT OF THE SWEET MANIOC BEIJU FROM BRAZIL A SORT OF NATIONAL BRANDY THE CHICA OF PERU THE MAZATO OF THE UCAYALI
YOUR NAME IS DACOSTA AT THE GUILTY NAME WHICH TORRES THUS GAVE HIM
AND I AM OFF OFF YOU GO FRAGOSO SAID JOAM AND MAY THE REIS RAIN INTO YOUR POCKET YES AND THAT IS A PROPER SORT OF RAIN
AND TO THIS MATTER HE HAD ATTENDED ENTIRELY HIMSELF
AND ON THE BORDERS OF WHICH A LEGEND SAYS THAT INDIANS WITH TAILS ONCE EXISTED IN THE MORNING OF THE EIGHTH OF JULY THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE OF SAN ANTONIO
AND THEN FRAGOSO JUMPED IN TO THE ANIMAL AND THRUST IN A KNIFE TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS THROAT AT THE RISK OF HAVING HIS ARM SNAPPED OFF BY THE TWO JAWS HAD THEY QUICKLY CLOSED FRAGOSO PULLED OUT HIS ARM IN TIME BUT HE COULD NOT AVOID THE CHOCK OF THE CAYMAN
AND WE SEE THEM MARCHING IN THE FIRST RANK OF THE CIVILIZING ADVANCE IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FOUNDATION OF THE PORTUGO BRAZILIAN EMPIRE THAT BRAZIL PROCLAIMED ITS INDEPENDENCE BY THE VOICE OF DON JUAN WHOM THE FRENCH ARMIES HAD CHASED FROM PORTUGAL
IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA IT CONTAINS A MORE NOXIOUS JUICE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO PREVIOUSLY GET RID OF BY PRESSURE WHEN THIS RESULT IS OBTAINED THE ROOT IS REDUCED TO FLOUR
AND BESIDES THERE WAS THE IRONWOOD
WHICH OBSTRUCTED IT BEFORE TAKING TO THE SAW AND THE AX THEY HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH A FELLING SWORD THAT INDISPENSABLE TOOL OF EVERY ONE WHO DESIRES TO PENETRATE THE AMAZONIAN FORESTS A LARGE BLADE SLIGHTLY CURVED WIDE AND FLAT AND TWO OR THREE FEET LONG
WHO WOULD FOR VERY GOOD REASONS HAVE PREFERRED SOME RAPID STEAMBOAT BUT THOUGH THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT DEVISED BY JOAM WERE PRIMITIVE IN THE EXTREME HE WAS GOING TO TAKE WITH HIM A NUMEROUS FOLLOWING AND ABANDON HIMSELF TO THE STREAM UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS OF COMFORT AND SECURITY
THE CONTINUED DESCENT ON THE EVENING OF THE FIFTH OF JULY THE ATMOSPHERE HAD BEEN OPPRESSIVE SINCE THE MORNING AND THREATENED APPROACHING STORMS LARGE BATS OF RUDDY COLOR SKIMMED WITH THEIR HUGE WINGS THE CURRENT OF THE AMAZON
AND BELONGING TO THE PARISH OF SAINT PAUL ESTABLISHED ON THE RIGHT A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN STREAM JOAM GARRAL HAD DECIDED TO PASS THIRTY SIX HOURS HERE SO AS TO GIVE A LITTLE REST TO THE CREW THEY WOULD NOT START THEREFORE UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SEVENTH
BUT AN EARLIER LAYING HAD TAKEN PLACE TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE EGGS HAD HATCHED UNDER THE ACTION OF THE HEAT STORED IN THE SAND AND ALREADY SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF LITTLE TURTLES WERE RUNNING ABOUT THE BEACH THE HUNTERS WERE THEREFORE IN LUCK
EVERY NATIVE WAS THERE MEN WOMEN THE OLD AND THE YOUNG IN THEIR NEARLY PRIMITIVE COSTUME LOOKING ON WITH ALL THEIR EYES LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR EARS THE SMILING ENTERTAINER HALF IN PORTUGUESE HALF IN TICUNIAN FAVORED THEM WITH HIS CUSTOMARY ORATION
WHICH COMING FROM THE EAST SOUTHEAST BRINGS IN ITS BLACK WATERS BY A MOUTH FIVE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND ADMIRED THE LEGIONS OF MONKEYS SULPHUR WHITE IN COLOR
AT PRESENT THE CAPITAL OF THE UPPER AMAZON IT BEGAN AS A SIMPLE MISSION FOUNDED BY THE PORTUGUESE CARMELITES ABOUT SIXTEEN NINETY TWO AND AFTERWARD ACQUIRED BY THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES FROM THE BEGINNING
WALKED ABOUT THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CRAFT AWAITING THE HOUR OF REPOSE
IN TAKING HIM ON BOARD THE FAZENDER HAD OBEYED A SENTIMENT OF HUMANITY IN THE MIDST OF THESE VAST AMAZONIAN DESERTS MORE ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME WHEN THE STEAMERS HAD NOT BEGUN TO FURROW THE WATERS
THEIR SHELL IS STILL SOFT THEIR FLESH EXTREMELY TENDER AND AFTER THEY HAVE COOKED THEM THEY EAT THEM JUST LIKE OYSTERS IN THIS FORM LARGE QUANTITIES ARE CONSUMED
IT REMAINED ONLY TO DEFINE THE FRONTIER BETWEEN THE NEW EMPIRE AND THAT OF ITS NEIGHBOR PERU THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER
WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT THE MATERIAL PROOF OF THE INNOCENCE OF THE FAZENDER EXISTED AND THAT THIS PROOF WAS IN THE HANDS OF TORRES
WHAT WAS THE FELLOW DOING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE FAZENDA WHEN WE MET HIM IN THE FOREST OF IQUITOS WHY DID HE THEN REFUSE THE HOSPITALITY WHICH WE OFFERED SO AS TO AFTERWARD MANAGE TO FORCE HIMSELF ON US AS OUR TRAVELING COMPANION WE ARRIVE
AND BOMBAX OF SUPERB STATURE WITH ITS STRAIGHT AND SMOOTH WHITE STEM AMONG THESE MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS OF THE AMAZONIAN FLORA THERE FELL MANY QUATIBOS WHOSE ROSY CANOPIES TOWERED ABOVE THE NEIGHBORING TREES WHOSE FRUITS ARE LIKE LITTLE CUPS WITH ROWS OF CHESTNUTS RANGED WITHIN
SAID TORRES YOUR WIFE KNOWS NOT THAT SHE IS THE WIFE OF JOAM DACOSTA
HE REGAINED HIS FORMER ACTIVITY HIS PEOPLE REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY AT SEEING HIM AGAIN AT WORK HIS MORAL SELF REACTED AGAINST HIS PHYSICAL SELF AND JOAM AGAIN BECAME THE ACTIVE ENERGETIC MAN OF HIS EARLIER YEARS
AND PROPELLED WHEN THE WIND FELL BY SIX LONG SWEEPS WHICH INDIANS WORKED FROM A FORECASTLE BUT NEITHER OF THESE VESSELS SATISFIED JOAM GARRAL FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE HAD RESOLVED TO DESCEND THE AMAZON HE HAD THOUGHT OF MAKING THE MOST OF THE VOYAGE BY CARRYING A HUGE CONVOY OF GOODS INTO PARA
HEAVEN HELP US HE SAID TO HIM WE SHALL SEE IF TRUTH WILL COME DOWN TO THE EARTH FROM ABOVE THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE MADE A SIGN TO HIS MEN WHO ADVANCED TO SECURE JOAM GARRAL BUT SPEAK FATHER SHOUTED BENITO MAD WITH DESPAIR
AND CARRIED AWAY BY HIS CUSTOMARY VIVACITY CAME UP TO JOAM GARRAL
AND PREVENTED PERHAPS BY THE ARRIVAL OF PADRE PASSANHA WHO HAD COME TO BID THE FAMILY GOOD NIGHT HAD GONE BACK TO HIS CABIN THE INDIANS AND THE NEGROES WERE AT THEIR QUARTERS ALONG THE SIDES ARAUJO
AND IT IS THUS THAT YOU RESPECT THE WISHES OF A DYING MAN OF A CRIMINAL TORTURED BY REMORSE AND WHO HAS CHARGE YOU TO REPAIR AS MUCH AS HE COULD THE EVIL WHICH HE HAD DONE
MINHA VALDEZ WOULD BE THE SAME TO HER AS MINHA GARRAL AND TO CHECK HER SPIRITS SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER MISTRESS AND THAT WAS NEVER THOUGHT OF
HE NOTED THE POINTS OF THE RIVER GAUGE AND SHOUTED HURRAH AS THE WATER CREPT UP IT WILL SWIM IT WILL SWIM HE SHOUTED THE RAFT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO BELEM IT WILL FLOAT IF ALL THE CATARACTS OF THE SKY HAVE TO OPEN TO FLOOD THE AMAZON
EVEN IN THE FORM OF TAPIOCA ACCORDING TO THE FANCY OF THE NATIVES ON BOARD THE JANGADA THERE WAS A HUGE PILE OF THIS USEFUL PRODUCT DESTINED FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AS FOR PRESERVED MEATS NOT FORGETTING A WHOLE FLOCK OF SHEEP
AS HAS BEEN SAID BELOW IT IS BRAZILIAN AND TAKES THE NAME OF THE AMAZON IT WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE THAT THE JANGADA STOPPED BEFORE TABATINGA THE FIRST BRAZILIAN TOWN SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE RIVER OF WHICH IT BEARS THE NAME
AND HE DIED THE MAN'S NAME EXCLAIMED JOAM GARRAL IN A TONE HE COULD NOT CONTROL YOU WILL KNOW IT WHEN I AM ONE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE WRITING
SHIRKING THE EDDIES AND MAINTAINING THE ADVANCE THEY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE AHUATY PARANA A SORT OF NATURAL CANAL WHICH GOES OFF A LITTLE BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE TUNANTINS
INEXPERIENCED FISHERMEN WOULD AT FIRST HAVE TAKEN THESE MOVING POINTS FOR FLOATING WRECKAGE BUT THE NATIVES OF FONTEBOA WERE NOT TO BE SO DECEIVED
ON THIS OCCASION MANOEL HAD DECLINED TO ACCOMPANY HIM FRAGOSO HAD LEFT THE JANGADA BUT INSTEAD OF MOUNTING TO THE FORT HE HAD MADE FOR THE VILLAGE
DANGER WAS NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THERE WERE NO PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ATTACKS TO CONCLUDE OUR DESCRIPTION OF THE JANGADA WE HAVE ONLY TO SPEAK OF ONE OR TWO ERECTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS WHICH GAVE IT A VERY PICTURESQUE ASPECT
SAY ONE WORD AND WE SHALL CONTEST EVEN BY FORCE THIS HORRIBLE MISTAKE OF WHICH YOU ARE THE VICTIM THERE IS NO MISTAKE HERE MY SON REPLIED JOAM GARRAL JOAM DACOSTA AND JOAM GARRAL ARE ONE
ONLY WHEN THE RAFT WAS MADE UP HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE TO BENITO
WHICH CARRIES THE PIGMY FORT THE HOUSE OF THE COMMANDANT CONSISTS OF A COUPLE OF HUTS PLACED IN A SQUARE AND THE SOLDIERS OCCUPY AN OBLONG BUILDING A HUNDRED FEET AWAY AT THE FOOT OF A LARGE TREE
AND RETURN BY IT INTO THE MAIN RIVER AT FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE TENTH OF AUGUST THEY PUT INTO THE ISLAND OF COCOS THEY THERE PASSED A SERINGAL THIS NAME IS APPLIED TO A
BETWEEN THE TWO MEN FOR A MOMENT ALONE IN THE ROOM WHERE NONE COULD SEE OR HEAR THEM
AND WAS AS QUIET AS BEFORE AND SO HE SAID THE WORTHY TORRES IS ANXIOUS TO ENTER THE FAMILY OF A MURDERER AND A THIEF I AM THE SOLE JUDGE OF WHAT IT SUITS ME TO DO SAID TORRES
WHO HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE FAZENDA HE HAD KNOWN THE CHILDREN FROM BIRTH HE HAD BAPTIZED THEM EDUCATED THEM AND HOPED TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE NUPTIAL BLESSING THE AGE OF THE PADRE DID NOT ALLOW OF HIS EXERCISING HIS IMPORTANT MINISTRY ANY LONGER
IT WAS MARKED ENOUGH FOR EVEN BENITO TO NOTICE IT NOT WITHOUT SURPRISE AND HE OBSERVED THAT HIS FATHER GAVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS SO CURIOUSLY PROPOUNDED BY TORRES
THEY DID WONDERS SOME PEOPLE UNACCUSTOMED TO THESE GREAT TREE MASSACRES WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GROANED TO SEE GIANTS MANY HUNDRED YEARS OLD FALL IN A FEW HOURS BENEATH THE AXES OF THE WOODMEN
IN THE FACE OF THIS FACT SO MUCH HAD TO BE ADMITTED MANOEL SAID THIS TO BENITO IN AN UNDERTONE THAT IS TRUE REPLIED BENITO EMBARRASSED YOU ARE RIGHT AND IN A SENSE IT IS ONE CRUEL CARE THE LESS
BUT IT DISTRESSES ME TO SEE THIS ADVENTURER CONSTANTLY OBTRUDING HIMSELF BY HIS PRESENCE AND CONVERSATION ON YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER AND SEEKING TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF INTO THAT INTIMACY WITH YOUR FAMILY WHICH IS ALREADY MINE
A DOZEN WIDE AND SIX DEEP AFTER LAYING THEIR EGGS THEY COVER THEM WITH A BED OF SAND WHICH THEY BEAT DOWN WITH THEIR CARAPACES AS IF THEY WERE RAMMERS THIS EGG LAYING OPERATION IS A GRAND AFFAIR FOR THE RIVERINE INDIANS OF THE AMAZON AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
WHICH IS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED METERS WIDE
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND MEANS OF SAFE AND RAPID TRANSIT BOATS DID NOT PLY REGULARLY AND IN MOST CASES THE TRAVELER WAS OBLIGED TO WALK ACROSS THE FORESTS THIS IS WHAT TORRES HAD DONE AND WHAT HE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE DONE
AN INNUMERABLE CROWD OF MONKEYS WHO WERE HARDLY THEIR SUPERIORS IN AGILITY SLUNG THEMSELVES INTO THE UPPER BRANCHES SAWING OFF THE HEAVIER BOUGHS AND CUTTING DOWN THE TOPMOST LIMBS WHICH HAD TO BE CLEARED AWAY ON THE SPOT VERY SOON THERE REMAINED ONLY A DOOMED FOREST
HIS FACE GLOWED WITH GENEROUS RESOLUTION GOING UP TO YAQUITA HE SAID MY MOTHER TO MINHA HE SAID MY WIFE AND TO BENITO HE SAID MY BROTHER AND TURNING TOWARD LINA AND FRAGOSO
AND WILL NO DOUBT RAPIDLY DEVELOP FOR THERE WILL STOP THE BRAZILIAN STEAMERS WHICH ASCEND THE RIVER AND THE PERUVIAN STEAMERS WHICH DESCEND IT THERE THEY WILL TRANSHIP PASSENGERS AND CARGOES IT DOES NOT REQUIRE MUCH FOR AN ENGLISH OR AMERICAN VILLAGE TO BECOME IN A FEW YEARS THE CENTER OF CONSIDERABLE COMMERCE
I WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE ANSWERED FRAGOSO
WELL IF THAT IS YOUR INTENTION WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO ASK ME I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU SAW ANY INCONVENIENCE IN MY WORKING AT MY PROFESSION ON OUR ROUTE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR MY HAND TO RUST AND BESIDES
FOR IT COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE WHITISH WATERS OF THE RIVER THEY HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS COLORING IN MANY WAYS SAID HE BUT I DO NOT THINK THE MOST LEARNED HAVE YET ARRIVED AT A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
THE COMMANDANT DID NOT WAIT FOR A SECOND INVITATION AND AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
THE NIGHT PASSED AT THE MOORINGS NEAR A SLIGHTLY RISING SHORE AND NOTHING DISTURBED THE QUIET
TURNING PALE AH IT IS NOT A FEELING OF JEALOUSY THOUGH THAT EXASPERATES YOU AGAINST SUCH A MAN SAID BENITO QUICKLY
AND HER PEOPLE NOT ONE DARED TO SAY A WORD TO THEM IT WAS TORRES WHO IN A HOLLOW VOICE AND WITH HIS CUSTOMARY IMPUDENCE BROKE THE PAINFUL SILENCE FOR THE LAST TIME JOAM GARRAL HE SAID
WHAT A QUEER SMELL AM I WRONG DO YOU NOT NOTICE IT ONE WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS THE ODOR OF BURNING MUSK REPLIED BENITO THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME ALLIGATORS ASLEEP ON THE NEIGHBORING BEACH WELL NATURE HAS DONE WISELY IN ALLOWING THEM SO TO BETRAY THEMSELVES
THE INDIANS ALONG THE RIVER BELONG TO PEACEABLE TRIBES AND THE FIERCEST OF THEM HAVE RETIRED BEFORE THE ADVANCING CIVILIZATION AND DRAWN FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
THERE IS NOTHING CERTAIN IN THE MATTER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE EXCELLENT TO DRINK OF A FRESHNESS QUITE ENVIABLE FOR THE CLIMATE AND WITHOUT AFTER TASTE AND PERFECTLY HARMLESS
THE SAP BEING OBTAINED THE INDIANS TO PREVENT THE SEPARATION OF ITS PECULIAR RESINS
WHICH RAINED INTO THE POCKET OF FRAGOSO AND WHICH HE COLLECTED WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION
AN INEXTRICABLE NETWORK WHICH RENDERS THE HYDROGRAPHY OF THIS COUNTRY SO DIFFICULT
JOAM GARRAL REPLIED BY AN AFFIRMATIVE NOD
WOULD RAISE IT AND CARRY IT FOR HUNDREDS OF LEAGUES TO THE ATLANTIC COAST THE WHOLE TIME THE WORK WAS GOING ON JOAM GARRAL HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SUPERINTENDING IT FROM THE CLEARING TO THE BANK OF THE FAZENDA HE HAD FORMED A LARGE MOUND ON WHICH THE PORTIONS OF THE RAFT WERE DISPOSED
SOME OF EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS HOPED WOULD FIGURE IN TURN ON THE TABLES OF THE MASTER AND HIS MEN AND SO EACH DAY SHOOTING AND FISHING WERE TO BE REGULARLY INDULGED IN FOR BEVERAGES THEY HAD A GOOD STORE OF THE BEST THAT COUNTRY PRODUCED CAYSUMA OR
AND LEAVING ON EACH SIDE A GANGWAY FOR THE ROWERS OR JANGADA RAFTS OF NO PARTICULAR SHAPE PROPELLED BY A TRIANGULAR SAIL AND SURMOUNTED BY A CABIN OF MUD AND STRAW WHICH SERVED THE INDIAN AND HIS FAMILY FOR A FLOATING HOME
IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY AND IT COULD NOT HOLD THE WHOLE OF THE CREW BUT IT WAS RICHLY DECORATED
AND THOSE WHO COME FROM THE VILLAGES OF THE JAVARY A LONG ARRAY OF ANXIOUS ONES FORMED ITSELF IN THE SQUARE
WHICH IS REDUCED TO A FINE POWDER AND WITH THE ADDITION OF WATER YIELDS AN EXCELLENT DRINK AND THIS WAS NOT ALL THERE IS IN THESE COUNTRIES A SPECIES OF DARK VIOLET WINE
HE AND THE FAMILY RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT RECEPTION FROM THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITIES OF THE TOWN THE COMMANDANT OF THE PLACE AND THE CHIEF OF THE CUSTOM HOUSE WHOSE FUNCTIONS DID NOT IN THE LEAST PREVENT THEM FROM ENGAGING IN TRADE
FROM THE OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION OF THE RISING IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THERE WAS NOT MUCH LONGER TO WAIT ALL WAS READY TO DATE THE FIFTH OF JUNE THE PILOT ARRIVED THE EVENING BEFORE HE WAS A MAN ABOUT FIFTY WELL UP IN HIS PROFESSION
WHAT CONNECTION CAN POSSIBLY EXIST BETWEEN YOUR FATHER AND THIS ADVENTURER EVIDENTLY YOUR FATHER HAS NEVER SEEN HIM I DO NOT SAY THAT MY FATHER KNOWS TORRES SAID BENITO BUT ASSUREDLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TORRES KNOWS MY FATHER
AND THEN MEN AND WOMEN WITH EQUAL EAGERNESS TOOK THEIR PLACES ON THE BARBER'S STOOL THE SCISSORS OF FRAGOSO HAD LITTLE TO DO
JOAM GARRAL AND HIS WIFE LINA AND OLD CYBELE WERE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE TORRES
BEHOLD THEN FRAGOSO ON THE ROAD COMING UP THE SHADY LANE BENEATH THE FICUSES AND ARRIVING IN THE CENTRAL SQUARE OF TABATINGA AS SOON AS HE SET FOOT IN THE PLACE THE FAMOUS BARBER WAS SIGNALED RECOGNIZED SURROUNDED
AND THE WHOLE TRIBE OF THE TICUNAS WOULD COME TO ME TO HAVE THEIR HAIR LOOKED AFTER THEY WON'T HESITATE TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF CURLING TONGS' THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL CALL ME IF I REVISIT THE WALLS OF TABATINGA I HAVE ALREADY HAD TWO TRIES HERE AND MY SCISSORS AND COMB HAVE DONE MARVELS
THE NATIVES COULD GET DRINKS OF THE CRUDEST AND PARTICULARLY ASSAI A LIQUOR HALF SOLD HALF LIQUID MADE OF THE FRUIT OF THE PALM TREE AND DRUNK FROM A COUI OR HALF CALABASH IN GENERAL USE IN THIS DISTRICT OF THE AMAZON
AND SO SAYING FRAGOSO RAPIDLY MOVED AWAY A MOMENT AFTERWARD THE FAMILY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JOAM WENT ASHORE
FROM ONE BANK TO ANOTHER ITS WIDTH IS ABOUT TWO LEAGUES
DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS THE REGION HAD ALL THE ASPECTS OF A COMPLETE WILDERNESS NOW AND THEN THEY SAW SMOKE WHICH JARVIS SAID
BUT THE DEFENSES OF THE FORT WERE TOO STRONG THE CHARGE DRIVEN HOME WITH RECKLESS COURAGE BEAT IN VAIN UPON THOSE HIGH EARTHEN WALLS BEHIND WHICH THE DEFENDERS STANDING UPON NARROW PLATFORMS
TIS CARRINGTON'S WAY AND A GOOD WAY HARK LISTEN TO IT THE SIGNAL READY MEN READY HERE THEY COME THE GREAT CANNONADE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE STILLNESS WAS MORE AWFUL THAN THE THUNDER OF THE GUNS HAD BEEN
IT IS TRUE SAID SAINT CLAIR HE IS DEFIANT HE SAYS THAT HE WILL HOLD THE FORT FOR THE UNION I HAD HOPED THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP SAID COLONEL TALBOT IT MIGHT HELP THE WAY TO A COMPOSITION HE PULLED HIS LONG MUSTACHE AND LOOKED SOMBERLY AT THE FLAG
WHERE THE WARM LIGHT LOVES TO DWELL WEARY LOOKS YET TENDER SPEAK THEIR FOND FAREWELL NITA JUANITA ASK THY SOUL IF WE SHOULD PART NITA JUANITA LEAN THOU ON MY HEART
AFFAIRS MUST BE MOVING NOW IN THE GREAT WORLD IN THE EAST AND HE WISHED TO BE AT THE HEART OF THEM HE HAD A STRONG SURE FOOTED HORSE AND HE HAD SUPPLIES AND AN EXTRA SUIT OF CLOTHES IN HIS SADDLE BAGS
HE COULD SEE BUT DIMLY THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER ALL ELSE WAS LOST IN THE HEAVY GLOOM BUT THE BOAT HAD BEEN BUILT SO WELL AND THE CANVAS COVER WAS SO TAUT AND TIGHT THAT NOT A DROP ENTERED
HE SAID AN I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN AG'IN EM I ADMIT THEIR CLAIMS BEFORE THEY MAKE EM BUT MY TRUE LOVE IT'S THE MOUNTAINS AN MY MOUNTAIN HOME
AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO HURRY HIM AND THERE WAS MUCH TO BE SEEN IF CHARLESTON HAD BEEN CROWDED RICHMOND WAS MORE SO LIKE ALL CAPITALS ON THE VERGE OF A GREAT WAR BUT AS YET UNTOUCHED BY ITS DESTRUCTIVE BREATH IT THROBBED WITH LIFE
MISTER BENJAMIN DID NOT SPEAK THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW BUT HE WATCHED HARRY CLOSELY
THE WIND HAD RISEN A LITTLE AND IT WHIPPED ABOUT THE STAFF ITS FLUTTERING MOTIONS SEEMED TO HARRY MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN EVER OF DEFIANCE HE UNDERSTOOD THE MELANCHOLY RING IN COLONEL TALBOT'S VOICE HE TOO LIKE THE BOY'S FATHER HAD FOUGHT UNDER THAT FLAG
WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM AND ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED TO BE TAKING NO PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CROSSING THEY WATCHED EVERYTHING INTENTLY TWO OF THEM WERE VERY TALL BUT THE THIRD WAS SHORTER AND SLENDER
NAMES THAT HE WOULD NEVER FORGET BUT NAMES THAT AS YET MEANT LITTLE TO HIM HE HAD LETTERS FROM HIS FATHER AND HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIS FRIENDS OF CHARLESTON IN RICHMOND OR AT THE FRONT
IN THE UNITED STATES HE WAS A GUEST AT MY FATHER'S HOUSE LAST YEAR WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY IT IS THE MAN WHO RECEIVED MORE POPULAR VOTES THAN LINCOLN BUT FEWER IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
AND A BAND OF YELLING SIOUX OR BLACKFEET WERE TO SET AFTER YOU WITH FELL DESIGNS UPON YOUR SCALP WHAT WOULD YOU DO I'D RUN SIR WITH ALL MY MIGHT I'D RUN FASTER THAN I EVER RAN BEFORE
WHICH CROSSED THE RIVER AT A POINT WHERE THE HILLS ON EITHER SIDE DIPPED LOW AS THEY DREW NEAR THEY HEARD MANY VOICES AND THE LIGHTS INCREASED TO A DOZEN JARVIS'S BELIEF
ESPECIALLY LADS OF SPIRIT AND FIRE LIKE YOU YOU SHALL BE A SECOND LIEUTENANT IN HIS COMMAND A TRAIN WILL LEAVE HERE IN FOUR HOURS BE READY IT WILL TAKE YOU PART OF THE WAY AND YOU WILL MARCH ON FOR THE REST
IT SEEMED TO HARRY THAT THE POINTS OF THE BAYONETS WERE ALMOST IN HIS FACE AND THEN AT THE SHOUTED COMMAND THE WHOLE EARTHWORK BURST INTO A BLAZE THE CANNON AND HUNDREDS OF RIFLES SENT THEIR DEADLY VOLLEYS
THE NOTES OF THE OLD MELODY SWELLED AND AS BEFORE THE DEEP CHANNEL OF THE RIVER GAVE THEM BACK AGAIN IN FAINT AND DYING ECHOES TIME AND PLACE
WHICH A RISING WIND WHIPPED ABOUT SHARPLY BUT JARVIS FIRST STEERED THE BOAT UNDER THE EDGE OF A HIGH BANK WHERE IT WAS PROTECTED PARTLY AND THEY STRETCHED THE STRONG CANVAS BEFORE THE FIRST DROPS OF RAIN FELL
AND THE WORD WAS PASSED TO THE MEN THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL DAWN BUT BEFORE THEY LAY DOWN ON THE GROUND COLONEL TALBOT TOLD THEM WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM WHICH WAS MUCH
AND SENT STEEL SPLINTERS AND FRAGMENTS FLYING IN EVERY DIRECTION A RAIN OF DIRT FOLLOWED THE RAIN OF STEEL AND WHEN THE COLONEL WIPED THE LAST MOTE FROM HIS EYE HE SAID TRIUMPHANTLY AND JOYOUSLY IT'S CARRINGTON NOT A SHADOW OF DOUBT CAN BE LEFT
AND TO THE WARM FRIENDSHIP OF ARTHUR SAINT CLAIR WHO APPARENTLY WAS RELATED TO EVERYBODY A LETTER CAME FROM HIS FATHER TO WHOM HE HAD WRITTEN AT ONCE OF HIS PURPOSE GIVING HIS APPROVAL AND SENDING HIM MORE MONEY COLONEL KENTON WROTE THAT HE WOULD COME SOUTH HIMSELF
I THINK THAT HE AND MORGAN ARE RELATED I FANCY THEY ARE GOING SOUTH OR MAYBE TO VIRGINIA HARRY THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE YES SAM THEY ARE MY PEOPLE
THE FULL TENOR ROSE AND SWELLED ABOVE THE SWEEP OF WIND AND RAIN AND THE MAN'S SOUL WAS IN THE WORDS HE SANG A GREAT VOICE WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF STORM THE WATER BEFORE THEM
SPEEDING AWAY IN ECHOES AMONG THE LOFTY PEAKS AND RIDGES THAT HAD NOW TURNED FROM HILLS INTO REAL MOUNTAINS THEY TOWERED FAR ABOVE THE STREAM AND EVERYWHERE
THEN BUST SAID HARRY SOFT O'ER THE FOUNTAIN LINGERING FALLS THE SOUTHERN MOON FAR O'ER THE MOUNTAIN BREAKS THE DAY TOO SOON IN THY DARK EYES SPLENDOR
HIS PAPERS BEING IN PERFECT ORDER HE ATE DINNER AS THE NOONDAY MEAL WAS THEN CALLED AND DECIDED TO SEEK GENERAL BEAUREGARD AT ONCE HAVING LEARNED FROM AN OFFICER ON THE TRAIN THAT HE WAS IN THE CITY
THE LAST THING HARRY SAW AS HE TURNED BACK TOWARD MADAME DELAUNAY'S WAS THAT DEFIANT FLAG OF THE UNION STILL WAVING ABOVE THE DARK AND LOOMING MASS OF OLD SUMTER HE WAS UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM WHEN SHEPARD CAME BRISKLY DOWN THE HALL
BUT CHANGING OFTENER AT THE OARS THEY STILL MADE GOOD HEADWAY THE RANGES DARK GREEN ON THE LOWER SLOPES BUT BLUE ON THE HIGHER RIDGES BEYOND THEM SLOWLY CAME NEARER
HE AND HIS WIFE KNEW JARVIS AND IKE WELL AND THEY GLANCED RATHER CURIOUSLY AT HARRY
NOTHIN OF COURSE WOULD WAKE THAT LUNKHEAD
BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE NORTHERN TROOPS WERE RETIRING CARRYING WITH THEM THEIR WOUNDED BUT LEAVING THE DEAD BEHIND HARRY EXCITED AND EAGER WAS ABOUT TO LEAP UPON THE CREST OF THE EARTHWORK BUT COLONEL TALBOT SHARPLY ORDERED HIM DOWN
IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE THREE AND ALL THEIR SUPPLIES DRY AND HARRY WATCHED THE STORM BEAT SULLEN THUNDER ROLLED UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST
HARRY AND SAINT CLAIR SLEPT WELL DESPITE THE NOISES OF A CAMP BUT THEY WERE READY AT THE APPOINTED TIME VERY PRECISE IN THEIR NEW UNIFORMS LANGDON WAS WITH THEM AND THE THREE WERE EAGER FOR THE MOVEMENT
YOU KIN JEST TALK AN TALK AN HE NEVER PUTS IN
HE SAW COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT HE SHOOK THE COLONEL'S HAND WITH VIGOR AND INTRODUCED HIM TO YOUNG SAINT CLAIR I HAVE JUST COME INTO THE CITY SAID THE COLONEL AND I HEARD ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT MAJOR ANDERSON HAD REMOVED HIS GARRISON FROM MOULTRIE TO SUMTER
THEY LEFT THE FORK OF THE KENTUCKY AT LAST AND ROWED UP ONE OF THE DEEP AND NARROW MOUNTAIN CREEKS PEAKS TOWERED ALL ABOUT THEM A HALF MILE OVER THEIR HEADS
AND HARROD AND HIS OWN GREAT ANCESTOR AND THE IMPRESSION WAS SO VIVID THAT THE VISION WAS TRANSLATED INTO FACT
AND THE COVE WAS VERY SNUG AND COMFORTABLE AFTER A DAY OF HARD AND CONTINUOUS WORK JARVIS AND IKE DID THE COOKING AT WHICH THEY WERE ADEPTS AFTER PULLIN A BOAT TEN OR TWELVE HOURS
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO DO BETTER HARRY WISHED THAT CARRINGTON WOULD NOT DO QUITE SO WELL HE WAS TIRED OF CROUCHING IN A DITCH HE WAS GROWING SOMEWHAT USED TO THE HIDEOUS HOWLING OF THE SHELLS BUT IT WAS STILL UNSAFE
VERY LIKELY YOU'D BE SEASICK IF YOU WERE ON IT THEN I LIKE IT BEST WHEN THE WAVES ARE NOT RUNNING THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CEASED AFTER A WHILE
THEIRS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CAMP TOO IT WAS ARRANGED NEATLY AND BY ITS SIDE FLOWED THE CLEAR COOL WATERS OF YOUNG'S BRANCH A TRIBUTARY OF THE LITTLE MANASSAS RIVER HE WALKED BRISKLY CROSSED THE BROOK STEPPING FROM STONE TO STONE
THE LETTER MADE THE BOY VERY THOUGHTFUL THE NEWS ABOUT HIS COUSIN OPENED HIS EYES THE LINE OF CLEAVAGE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS WIDENING INTO A GULF
WAS FULL OF SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM MAJOR ANDERSON WAS A KENTUCKIAN HE HAD HEARD HIS FATHER SPEAK OF HIM THEY HAD SERVED TOGETHER BUT IT WAS NOW EVIDENT TO HARRY THAT ANDERSON WOULD NOT GO WITH SOUTH CAROLINA YOU'LL SEE A SMALL BOAT COMING SOON FROM SUMTER
THAT'S SO I LIKE THE WEEPY ONES BEST BUT THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE ME FEEL SAD HARRY THEY JEST FILL ME WITH A KIND O LONGIN TO REACH OUT AN GRAB SOMETHIN
CALLED JARVIS CHEERFULLY LOOK WHAT A FINE WORLD IT IS HERE'S THE RIVER ALL WASHED CLEAN AN THE LAND ALL WASHED CLEAN TOO STIR YOURSELVES
FAR TO THE RIGHT HE SAW CAVALRY GALLOPING BACK AND FORTH AND TO THE LEFT HE SAW INFANTRY DRILLING FROM SOMEWHERE IN FRONT CAME THE STRAINS OF A REGIMENTAL BAND PLAYING
SAID SAINT CLAIR COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT SMILED SLIGHTLY THAT PART OF IT AT LEAST WILL DO YOU GOOD HE SAID YOU YOUNG MEN DON'T KNOW WHAT WAR IS AND YOU ARE GROWING FAT AND SAUCY IN A PLEASANT COUNTRY IN JUNE
NEARLY TWO SCORE OF THE INVINCIBLES HAD FALLEN TO RISE NO MORE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED WERE WOUNDED IT WAS NO SMALL LOSS EVEN FOR A VETERAN FORCE AND COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE LOOKED GRAVE
THE RIFLE ACROSS HIS BACK WOULD ATTRACT NO ATTENTION AS ALL THE MEN IN THE MOUNTAINS CARRIED RIFLES JARVIS HAD INSTRUCTED HARRY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE ROAD OR PATH AND AS THE BOY WAS ALREADY AN EXPERIENCED TRAVELER WITH AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF DIRECTION
WHILE YET IN SHELTER COULD SEE CLEARLY ALL THAT WAS GOING ON ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS NO EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WERE CROSSING THE STREAM THEY NUMBERED AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MEN
JARVIS TOOK A SMALL FLAT SKILLET FROM THE BOAT AND FRIED THE CORN CAKES HARRY FRIED BACON AND STRIPS OF DRIED BEEF IN ANOTHER THE HOMELY TASK IN GOOD COMPANY
UNLESS YOU AND IKE THROW ME OUT OF THE BOAT WELL SPOKE BOY SAID JARVIS HE DID NOT TELL HARRY THAT COLONEL KENTON
THAT NO TALK SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THEM HE PICKED UP A COPY OF THE MERCURY ONE MORNING AND SAW THAT A STEAMER THE STAR OF THE WEST WAS ON ITS WAY TO CHARLESTON FROM A NORTHERN PORT WITH SUPPLIES FOR THE GARRISON IN FORT SUMTER HE READ THE BRIEF ACCOUNT
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING AHEAD THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE OF THE STARCH OUT OF YOU AND TEACH YOU SENSE NO YOU NEEDN'T LOOK INQUIRINGLY AT ME BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT GO GET SOME SLEEP WHICH YOU WILL NEED BADLY
AND HESITATED BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN HE SPOKE IN A DECIDED WHISPER SINCE THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AN ARE GOIN ON THE SAME BUSINESS THAT YOU ARE
COME GINGERLY TO THE RIVER HARRY WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BRING HIM DOWN WITH THE FIRST SHOT AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT FILLED HIM WITH PRIDE AND JARVIS SOON SKINNED AND DRESSED THE ANIMAL ADDING HIM TO THEIR LARDER
THE NEW HARRY OF THE WEST WHOM WE WERE AFRAID WE SHOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST BUT WE HARDLY HOPED FOR THIS HOW DID YOU GET HERE HARRY
I SUPPOSE SO SAID HARRY BUT LOOK HOW THE PEOPLE GATHER THE BATTERY AND ALL THE HARBOR WERE NOW LINED WITH THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF CHARLESTON HARRY SAW SOLDIERS MOVING ABOUT SUMTER
BUT HE WAS NEEDED IN KENTUCKY WHERE A POWERFUL FACTION WAS OPPOSING THEIR PLANS HE SAID THAT HARRY'S COUSIN DICK MASON HAD JOINED THE HOME GUARDS RAISED IN THE INTERESTS OF THE OLD UNION AND WAS DRILLING ZEALOUSLY
S'POSE YOU STOP UP IN THE HILLS WITH US
INCLINING SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH MANY OF THE MEN OR RATHER BOYS NOT YET FAST IN THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE BEGAN TO TALK AND GUESS TOGETHER ABOUT THEIR ERRAND BUT COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
AND DEEPENING THE DITCHES MANY PICKS AND SPADES HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN THE FORT AND OTHERS USED BAYONETS ALL
THE YANKEES THAT WE DROVE OUT ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO COME BACK AND DRIVE US OUT SO THEY MUST BE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY FORCE FROM PATTERSON'S ARMY THE CONFERENCE OF THE OFFICERS WAS QUICKLY OVER AND THEN THE MEN WERE PUT TO WORK BUILDING HIGHER THE WALLS OF EARTH
THEY WERE GOING INTO BATTLE IN THE MORNING AND WITH MEN WHOM HE DID NOT HATE THE ATTACKS ON THE STAR OF THE WEST AND SUMTER HAD BEEN BOMBARDMENTS DISTANT AFFAIRS WHERE HE DID NOT SEE THE FACE OF HIS ENEMY
WAS LONG IN DYING ON THE RIVER DID YOU PICK UP THAT TOO FROM A WANDERING FIDDLER ASKED HARRY NO I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GOT IT
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNED IN IT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MY ORDERS I'D HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE MEN SERGEANT SAID SAINT CLAIR IF YOU WERE IN THE WEST AGAIN AND YOU WERE ALL ALONE IN THE HILLS OR ON THE PLAINS
TWO WILD TURKEYS JARVIS AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD ARRIVE HOME FULL HANDED IN EVERY RESPECT AND HIS GREAT TENOR BOOMED OUT JOYOUSLY OVER THE STREAM
IT DOES THE STRIPS PROVED THE NEXT DAY TO BE ALL THAT JARVIS HAD PROMISED AND THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITH RENEWED ELASTICITY FAIR WEATHER KEEPING THEM COMPANY
WITH THOSE BEHIND PRESSING CLOSE AFTER THEM THE DEFENDERS LOADED AND FIRED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AND THE HIGH WALLS OF EARTH HELPED THEM THE LOOSE DIRT GAVE AWAY AS THE NORTHERN MEN ATTEMPTED TO CLIMB THEM AND DIRT AND MEN
AND ALL HAD ARMS AND HORSES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE DISMOUNTED NOW AND THE HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY SMALL GUARDS WERE BEING CARRIED OVER THE RIVER FIRST EVIDENTLY THE MEN UNDERSTOOD THEIR WORK
THREE SCOUTS SENT OUT BY COLONEL TALBOT RETURNED WITH REPORTS THAT JUSTIFIED HIS SUSPICIONS A HEAVY FORCE EVIDENTLY FROM PATTERSON'S ARMY OPERATING IN THE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS WAS MARCHING DOWN THE VALLEY TO JOIN THOSE
HARRY YOU'LL FIND THREE TIN PLATES IN THE LOCKER IN THE BOAT FETCH EM HARRY ABANDONED HIS SKILLET FOR A MOMENT AND BROUGHT THE PLATES IKE THE COFFEE NOW BEING ABOUT READY
THERE WAS NO DANGER OF HIS GETTING LOST IN THE WILDERNESS JARVIS IKE AND MISSUS SIMMONS GAVE HIM FAREWELLS WHICH WERE FULL OF FEELING AUNT SUSE HAD COME DOWN THE BRICK WALK TAP TAPPING WITH HER CANE AS HARRY STOOD AT THE GATE READY TO MOUNT HIS HORSE
REDLY UPON THE MEN IN THE FORT HARRY LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE DARK GREEN WOODS HE REMEMBERED COOL BROOKS SWELLING INTO DEEP POOLS HERE AND THERE IN JUST SUCH WOODS AS THESE IN WHICH HE USED TO BATHE WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
WENT HIS THOUGHTS AGAIN TO THE FAR OFF TROUBLED TIME WHEN THE HUNTER IN THE VAST WILDERNESS DEPENDED FOR HIS LIFE ON THE QUICKNESS OF EYE AND EAR HE HAD READ SO MUCH OF BOONE AND KENTON
FELL TOGETHER BACK TO THE BOTTOM THE NORTHERN GUNNERS IN THE REAR OF THE ATTACK COULD NOT FIRE FOR FEAR OF HITTING THEIR OWN TROOPS BUT THE SOUTHERN CANNON AT THE EMBRASURES HAD A CLEAR TARGET SHOT AND SHELL CRASHED INTO THE NORTHERN RANKS
WAS INTENDED MAINLY TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE RETURN ATTACK BY THE SOUTHERN TROOPS BUT THEY WERE TOO CAUTIOUS TO VENTURE FROM THEIR EARTHWORKS THE INVINCIBLES HAD GROWN MANY YEARS OLDER IN A FEW HOURS
WHO PASSED HIM TO AN OFFICER WHO IN TURN TOLD HIM TO GO ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE WESTWARD WHERE HE WOULD FIND THE REGIMENT OF COLONEL TALBOT QUARTERED IT'S A MIXED REGIMENT HE SAID MADE UP OF VIRGINIANS SOUTH CAROLINIANS NORTH CAROLINIANS
WAS RISING FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF LOG CABINS AND ONCE OR TWICE THEY SAW CABINS THEMSELVES IN SHELTERED NOOKS BUT NOBODY HAILED THEM THE NEWS OF THE WAR HAD SPREAD HERE OF COURSE
SAID JARVIS AT THE SECOND CABIN I KNOW THE MAN WHO LIVES IN IT AN HE'S TO BE TRUSTED WE'D HAVE LEFT THE BOAT AN THE THINGS WITH HIM
THE LIGHTNING BLAZING AT INTERVALS AND THE THUNDER ROLLING IN A SUBLIME REFRAIN MOVED HARRY TO HIS INMOST SOUL THE SONG CEASED BUT ITS ECHO
BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN OF EXPERIENCE AND MAGNIFICENT SENSE WHAT YOU SAY PROVES THAT HARRY AND I ARE FULL OF WISDOM THEY WEREN'T SIOUX OR BLACKFEET BACK THERE AND I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'D HAVE SCALPED US BUT THEY WERE YANKEES
ME AN THAT LUNKHEAD IKE MY NEPHEW
I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
THREE MONTHS HAD GONE BY SINCE THE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN DOCTOR BRUCE CAME INTO HIS PULPIT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW DISCIPLESHIP THEY WERE THREE MONTHS OF GREAT EXCITEMENT IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
I AM OLDER BY SEVERAL YEARS THAN YOU YOUNG LADIES SHE SAID AND HER TRADITIONAL TYPE OF BEARING SEEMED TO RACHEL TO RISE UP LIKE A GREAT FROZEN WALL BETWEEN HER AND EVERY CONCEPTION OF JESUS AS A SACRIFICE WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED IN A SPIRIT OF FALSE EMOTION I PRESUME IS IMPOSSIBLE OF PERFORMANCE
SHE SIMPLY SAW A SOUL THAT HAD TASTED OF THE JOY OF A BETTER LIFE
TO GET NEARER THE GREAT PHYSICAL POVERTY AND SPIRITUAL DESTITUTION OF THE MIGHTY CITY THAT THROBBED AROUND THEM HOW COULD THEY DO THIS EXCEPT AS THEY BECAME A PART OF IT AS NEARLY AS ONE MAN CAN BECOME A PART OF ANOTHER'S MISERY
HE WAS HONESTLY PERPLEXED BY THE QUESTION
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MISS WINSLOW'S AFFAIRS BUT
BEFORE VIRGINIA HAD CEASED SPEAKING RACHEL'S FACE WAS PERFECTLY TRANSFORMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HER LIFE WORK IT FLOWED INTO HER HEART AND MIND LIKE A FLOOD AND THE TORRENT OF HER FEELING OVERFLOWED IN TEARS THAT COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED
IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PROCEEDING BUT THEY ALL AGREED THAT THE PAPER WAS BEING RUN ON NEW PRINCIPLES ANYHOW AND THEY ALL WATCHED MISTER NORMAN CAREFULLY AS HE SPOKE
SAID FELICIA WITH A SHOW OF INDIGNATION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW SIR THAT THOSE THINGS ARE THE BEST COOKED PUREST FOOD PRODUCTS IN THIS WHOLE CITY I DON'T DOUBT IT HE REPLIED HASTILY WHILE HIS EYES TWINKLED STILL THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING' YOU KNOW THE REST
HIS FINE FACE ACTUALLY GLOWED WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOVEMENT IN WHICH HE AND HIS FRIEND WERE INEVITABLY EMBARKED HE WENT ON AND UNFOLDED A PLAN OF SUCH FAR REACHING POWER AND POSSIBILITY THAT DOCTOR BRUCE CAPABLE AND EXPERIENCED AS HE WAS
ALTHOUGH TO SPEAK TRUTH FOR HIM HE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO BACK TO IT WELL DEAR BISHOP SAID FELICIA WHO HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIM SO I KNEW HOW OVERWHELMED YOU WERE WITH YOUR WORK
EVERY ONE IN THE STEREOTYPING AND COMPOSING ROOMS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE UNHEARD OF OMISSION TWO OR THREE TIMES DURING THE DAY WHEN MISTER NORMAN HAD OCCASION TO VISIT THE COMPOSING ROOMS THE MEN STOPPED THEIR WORK OR GLANCED AROUND THEIR CASES LOOKING AT HIM CURIOUSLY
THE BISHOP REMAINED IN THE DEEP EASY CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BUT HIS EYE BURNED WITH THE BLOW THAT BELONGED TO HIM BEFORE HE MADE SOME GREAT RESOLVE EDWARD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE ABRUPTLY I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY MYSELF EITHER IN OBEYING MY PROMISE
SHE KNEW THAT THE EVANGELIST BOARDED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE TENT A NUMBER OF VOICES GAVE THE DIRECTION COME LOREEN I WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME TO MISTER GRAY'S SHE SAID
AND THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
IT WAS FALL AGAIN AND THE CITY FACED ANOTHER HARD WINTER THE BISHOP ONE AFTERNOON CAME OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK INTENDING TO GO ON A VISIT TO ONE OF HIS NEW FRIENDS IN THE DISTRICT
IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
AND BRETHREN AND SISTERS YEA AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE AND WHOSOEVER FORSAKETH NOT ALL THAT HE HATH HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE
WOULD JESUS DO THAT THAT IS WOULD HE PROBABLY RUN A NEWSPAPER ON SOME LOVING FAMILY PLAN
STOP CRIED VIRGINIA MOTIONING TO THE DRIVER WHO WAS LOOKING AROUND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AND IN A MOMENT SHE WAS OUT AND HAD GONE UP TO THE GIRL AND TAKEN HER BY THE ARM LOREEN SHE SAID AND THAT WAS ALL THE GIRL LOOKED INTO HER FACE
SO FAR AS I CAN SEE THE LOSS WILL FALL ON MYSELF NEITHER THE REPORTERS NOR THE PRESSMEN NEED MAKE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGES IN THEIR PLANS HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND NO ONE SPOKE
OH GIVING THOSE VIOLETS TO THAT BOY HE LOOKED AS IF HE NEEDED A GOOD HOT SUPPER MORE THAN A BUNCH OF VIOLETS IT'S A WONDER YOU DIDN'T INVITE HIM HOME WITH US I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF YOU HAD
ALEXANDER POWERS USED TO BE A FRIEND OF MINE WE LEARNED TELEGRAPHY IN THE SAME OFFICE
IT IS ONE OF HIS BITTER REGRETS NOW THAT HIS EXTRAVAGANT HABITS OF LIFE BEFORE HIS CONVERSION PRACTICALLY THREW AWAY HALF THAT FATHER LEFT HIM WE ARE BOTH EAGER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION IN OUR POWER WHAT WOULD JESUS DO WITH THIS MONEY
BUT I FEEL THAT I MUST RESIGN MY PLACE AS PASTOR OF NAZARETH CHURCH IN ORDER TO SATISFY MYSELF THAT I AM WALKING AS I OUGHT TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THIS ACTION I JUDGE NO OTHER MINISTER AND PASS NO CRITICISM ON OTHERS DISCIPLESHIP
WHY SHOULD IT SEEM SO GREAT A THING IF WE HAVE BEEN LED TO GIVE OUR LIVES TO HELP RESCUE THE HEATHEN AND THE LOST OF OUR OWN CITY IN THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO TRY IT
IT IS AS OLD AS BETHLEHEM AND NAZARETH AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY THE HUNGER OF THESE TWO MEN TO SUFFER FOR CHRIST THERE HAD SPRUNG UP IN THEM AT THE SAME TIME A LONGING THAT AMOUNTED TO A PASSION
I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
AND HOWEVER THE BISHOP MAY HAVE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE NOTHING SO REMARKABLE ABOUT IT AT ALL THE PUBLIC CONTINUED TO TALK AND THE CHURCHES TO RECORD THEIR ASTONISHMENT THAT TWO SUCH MEN SO PROMINENT IN THE MINISTRY SHOULD LEAVE THEIR COMFORTABLE HOMES VOLUNTARILY RESIGN THEIR PLEASANT SOCIAL POSITIONS AND ENTER UPON A LIFE OF HARDSHIP OF SELF DENIAL AND ACTUAL SUFFERING
I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PEOPLE ARE DIRTY AND DISAGREEABLE AND IT'S TOO MUCH BOTHER I SUPPOSE REPLIED ROSE CARELESSLY FELICIA YOU CAN NEVER REFORM THE WORLD WHAT'S THE USE
WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH NEVER LOST THE IMPULSE OF THAT MOVEMENT STARTED BY DOCTOR BRUCE THOSE WHO WENT WITH HIM IN MAKING THE PROMISE BREATHED INTO THE CHURCH THE VERY BREATH OF DIVINE LIFE AND ARE CONTINUING THAT LIFE GIVING WORK AT THIS PRESENT TIME
AND THEN GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE RECTANGLE THE BENEFIT OF HER CULTURE AND HER VOICE IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SELF SACRIFICE REPLIED ROLLIN A LITTLE STIFFLY VIRGINIA LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE SHARPLY
WHAT WOULD HE DO WITH THAT OTHER LONG ADVERTISEMENT OF CHOICE LIQUORS AND CIGARS
JUST AS SURE AS YOU LIVE IF YOU SHUT OUT THIS PRIZE FIGHT REPORT YOU WILL LOSE HUNDREDS OF SUBSCRIBERS IT DOESN'T TAKE A PROPHET TO SEE THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE IN TOWN ARE EAGER TO READ IT
MAXWELL'S POSITION AT RAYMOND IS WELL TAKEN WHEN HE INSISTS THAT TO WALK IN THE STEPS OF CHRIST MEANS TO SUFFER WHERE HAS MY SUFFERING COME IN THE PETTY TRIALS AND ANNOYANCES OF MY CLERICAL LIFE ARE NOT WORTH MENTIONING AS SORROWS OR SUFFERINGS
WE MIGHT AS WELL FACE THAT FUTURE FACT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WILL YOU STAY BY THE NEWS UNTIL IT IS BANKRUPT ASKED NORMAN WITH A STRANGE SMILE
HAS BEEN DONE BY OUR SUNDAY MORNING PAPER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IF HE WERE IN MY PLACE TODAY IT WILL OCCASION SOME TROUBLE TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS CAUSED BY THIS CHANGE WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND SUBSCRIBERS THAT IS FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANGE ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL HURT THAT RACHEL HAD KEPT BACK SOMETHING SHE WAS SIMPLY CONSCIOUS OF MORE ON RACHEL'S MIND THAN SHE HAD REVEALED VERY SOON ROLLIN CAME BACK AND HE AND VIRGINIA ARM IN ARM AS THEY HAD LATELY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG HALL
BUT HE COULD NOT AVOID PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT QUESTION WAS BECOMING WITH HER AS WITH MANY OTHERS A HABIT OF LIFE SHE LOOKED AROUND NOW AS SHE STOOD CLOSE BY LOREEN AND THE WHOLE SCENE WAS CRUELLY VIVID TO HER
AND THE WORKING MAN ESPECIALLY WHO WOULD NOT GO TO CHURCH ANY WAY
ONE OF THE REPORTERS THERE WAS POUNDING OUT SOMETHING ON A TYPEWRITER EDWARD NORMAN BEGAN TO WRITE AN EDITORIAL THE DAILY NEWS WAS AN EVENING PAPER AND NORMAN USUALLY COMPLETED HIS LEADING EDITORIAL BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK HE HAD BEEN WRITING FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES WHEN THE MANAGING EDITOR CALLED OUT
RACHEL LOOKED AT VIRGINIA THOUGHTFULLY I HAVE NEVER GIVEN MY HEART TO HIM I AM SURE HE TOUCHED MY EMOTIONS AND I ADMIRED HIS SKILL AS A WRITER I HAVE THOUGHT AT TIMES THAT I CARED A GOOD DEAL FOR HIM
AS GOOD AS THE AUDITORIUM BANQUETS WERE SIMPLY HUSKS COMPARED WITH THIS ONE FELICIA BUT YOU MUST COME TO THE SETTLEMENT I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING AND I AM SIMPLY ASTONISHED TO FIND YOU HERE EARNING YOUR LIVING THIS WAY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS FEASIBLE IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PAY
I AM HAVING A HARDER TIME THAN YOU ARE DEAR TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD DO ARE YOU RACHEL ASKED
MISSUS STERLING HAD HER MEALS SERVED IN HER ROOM MISTER STERLING WAS PREOCCUPIED HE ATE VERY LITTLE AND EXCUSED HIMSELF EARLY AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT HE REMARKED AS HE WENT OUT THAT HE SHOULD BE DOWN TOWN ON SOME SPECIAL BUSINESS
AND RACHEL ACCORDINGLY RANG THE BELL AT THE PAGE MANSION ABOUT HALF PAST ELEVEN VIRGINIA HERSELF MET HER AND THE TWO WERE SOON TALKING EARNESTLY
I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED OF LATE TO LASH MYSELF WITH A SCOURGE
BUT HE WOULD BE LED BY EVENTS AS FAST AS THEY CAME ON HE OPENED HIS DOOR AND BEGAN THE ROUTINE OF THE OFFICE WORK
BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SILENCE THE QUESTION OF LATE WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST PAUL WAS TOLD WHAT GREAT THINGS HE MUST SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF HIS LORD
AND HAVE LIVED IN THE SOCIETY OF THE RICH REFINED ARISTOCRATIC MEMBERS OF MY CONGREGATIONS WHERE HAS THE SUFFERING COME IN WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR JESUS SAKE DO YOU KNOW CALVIN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TOWARD HIS FRIEND
THAT THOUGH HE WAS RICH YET FOR OUR SAKES HE BECAME POOR THAT YE THROUGH HIS POVERTY MIGHT BECOME RICH I REMEMBER IT WELL ENOUGH SAID ROSE WITH SOME PETULANCE
I SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY SAID VIRGINIA SMILING ACROSS THE TABLE I WAS IN THE NEWS OFFICE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES YES REPLIED RACHEL HASTILY I UNDERSTAND THAT MADAM PAGE
THEY HAD BOTH REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION BY THE SAME REASONING AND THEY WERE TOO THOUGHTFUL TOO WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THE MEASURING OF CONDUCT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR POSITION WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THE BISHOP AT LAST SPOKE GENTLY LOOKING WITH THE SMILE THAT ALWAYS BEAUTIFIED HIS FACE
IN SEVERAL MATTERS BEFORE HE ANSWERED HIS EVER PRESENT QUESTION IN THE RIGHT WAY IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY THINGS IN THE LIFE OF THE PAPER THAT WERE CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT HE DID NOT ACT AT ONCE BUT BECAUSE HE WAS YET HONESTLY IN DOUBT CONCERNING
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
CLARK DO YOU THINK IF JESUS WAS THE EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF A DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND HE WOULD PERMIT ADVERTISEMENTS OF WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN IT
ALL THIS AS A TOTAL FACT IN ITS CONTRAST WITH THE EASY COMFORTABLE LIFE I HAVE LIVED FILLS ME MORE AND MORE WITH A SENSE OF MINGLED TERROR AND SELF ACCUSATION I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF JESUS MANY TIMES LATELY
AND UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE AND THE MINISTER AS A LUXURIOUS IDLER ALL THE VAST TUMULT OF THIS VAST TORRENT OF HUMANITY WITH ITS FALSE AND ITS TRUE IDEAS ITS EXAGGERATION OF EVILS IN THE CHURCH AND ITS BITTERNESS AND SHAME THAT ARE THE RESULT OF MANY COMPLEX CAUSES
WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
COMPARED WITH PAUL OR ANY OF THE CHRISTIAN MARTYRS OR EARLY DISCIPLES I HAVE LIVED A LUXURIOUS SINFUL LIFE FULL OF EASE AND PLEASURE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I HAVE THAT WITHIN ME WHICH OF LATE RISES IN OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A FOLLOWING OF JESUS
CONCERNING THE CONCERT COMPANY'S OFFER
DOCTOR BRUCE WAS VERY PALE NEVER HAD HE SEEN THE BISHOP OR HEARD HIM WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A PASSION THERE WAS A SUDDEN SILENCE IN THE ROOM THE BISHOP SAT DOWN AGAIN AND BOWED HIS HEAD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE AT LAST EDWARD
THERE HAVE BEEN QUEER DOINGS IN RAYMOND DURING THE PAST YEAR
OR WHAT LED TO THE MOVEMENT HE FINALLY MADE TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO KNEW HIM BETTER THAN BY RELATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND THE BISHOP AT THIS TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLEDGE IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH THE TWO FRIENDS WERE AS BEFORE IN DOCTOR BRUCE'S HOUSE SEATED IN HIS STUDY
AND VIRGINIA'S BROTHER ROLLIN A YOUNG MAN WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT ONE OF THE CLUBS AND HAD NO AMBITION FOR ANYTHING BUT A GROWING ADMIRATION FOR RACHEL WINSLOW
DON'T YOU THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUGHT TO HEAR YOU
I HAVE COME TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT YET KEPT MY PROMISE TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THE WAY THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO IF I SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO WALK IN HIS STEPS DOCTOR BRUCE HAD RISEN AND WAS PACING HIS STUDY
RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
DO YOU MEAN GRANDMOTHER THAT WE CANNOT POSSIBLY ACT AS OUR LORD WOULD
YOU CAN ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I DO NOT STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH A MISERABLE MADAM PAGE LOST HER SELF CONTROL VIRGINIA STOPPED HER BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK THE NEXT WORD GRANDMOTHER THIS HOUSE IS MINE
HE COULD NOT GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL HE FELT ENRAGED AND ALARMED HE WAS SURE ANY SUCH POLICY WOULD RUIN THE PAPER AS SOON AS IT BECAME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE EDITOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BY SUCH AN ABSURD MORAL STANDARD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF BUSINESS IF THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED
THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
WOULD JESUS ADVERTISE WHISKEY AND TOBACCO IN HIS PAPER
ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE DRIVEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN FAVOR OF A DRUNKEN WOMAN THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR VIRGINIA TO REPLY SHE TURNED AGAIN AND WENT UPSTAIRS VIRGINIA CALLED A SERVANT AND SOON HAD LOREEN CARED FOR
WE WILL TAKE THE CAR HERE AT THE CORNER LOREEN STAGGERED TO HER FEET AND TO VIRGINIA'S SURPRISE MADE NO TROUBLE SHE HAD EXPECTED RESISTANCE OR A STUBBORN REFUSAL TO MOVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE CORNER AND TOOK THE CAR IT WAS NEARLY FULL OF PEOPLE GOING UPTOWN
AND OCCASIONALLY TO EASE ITS CONSCIENCE DONATING WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL SACRIFICE A LITTLE MONEY TO CHARITY
HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE SOFT EASY COMFORTS OF CIVILIZATION THE SIN AND MISERY OF THIS GREAT CITY HAVE BEATEN LIKE WAVES AGAINST THE STONE WALLS OF MY CHURCH AND OF THIS HOUSE IN WHICH I LIVE AND I HAVE HARDLY HEEDED THEM THE WALLS HAVE BEEN SO THICK
WHAT OTHER TIME DO THEY HEAR HER IT'S A GREAT PITY I SAY THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUTSIDE OF RAYMOND CANNOT HEAR HER VOICE LET US TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SAID RACHEL A LITTLE SHARPLY MADAM PAGE GLANCED AT HER AND SPOKE WITH A GENTLE COURTESY MY DEAR ROLLIN NEVER COULD
IT IS AS NECESSARY THAT WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SALOON INFLUENCE TO MEET AS IT IS TO HAVE A CHURCH OR A COLLEGE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MISTER NORMAN WILL KNOW HOW TO USE SO WELL
HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
IT WILL BE A GREAT MISTAKE IF YOU DO IN MY OPINION NORMAN SAT SILENT A MINUTE THEN HE SPOKE GENTLY BUT FIRMLY CLARK WHAT IN YOUR HONEST OPINION IS THE RIGHT STANDARD FOR DETERMINING CONDUCT IS THE ONLY RIGHT STANDARD FOR EVERY ONE THE PROBABLE ACTION OF JESUS CHRIST
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
DECIDEDLY THEREFORE YOU WILL PLEASE NOT INVITE HIM OR OTHERS LIKE HIM TO HOT SUPPERS BECAUSE I SUGGESTED IT OH DEAR I'M AWFULLY TIRED SHE YAWNED
PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE AT THAT CONCERT PITCH ALL THE TIME YOU SEE IF RACHEL DOESN'T GIVE IT UP SOON IT'S A GREAT PITY SHE DOESN'T COME TO CHICAGO AND SING IN THE AUDITORIUM CONCERTS SHE HAS RECEIVED AN OFFER I'M GOING TO WRITE AND URGE HER TO COME I'M JUST DYING TO HEAR HER SING FELICIA
AND DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER HIS SECRET HE AGAIN BECAME A FREQUENT VISITOR OF DON LEONARDO'S HOUSE WHERE HE WAS SURE TO MEET HIM CONSTANTLY THERE WERE TWO SPIRITS WHOM WE HAVE INTRODUCED TO THE READER IN THIS CONNECTION
THAT GAVE HER TAUT RIG AND SAUCY AIR A DASH OF MYSTERY WHICH WOULD HAVE SET HIM TO SPECULATING AT ONCE AS TO HER CHARACTER
AND WHEN MASTER WILL RATLIN FOR THAT WAS A NAME WE GIVE HIM WHEN HE FIRST CAME ON BOARD AND HE'S KEPT IT EVER SINCE WAS A MATTER OF FOURTEEN YEARS HE WAS NEARLY AS BIG AS HE IS NOW AND ACTED AS MATE
LAY AFT HERE AND BRAIL THE SPANKER UP CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN PROMPTLY AY AY SIR WAS THE RESPONSE OF A HALF DOZEN READY HANDS AS THEY SPRANG TO DO HIS BIDDING THE VESSEL WAS THUS BY THE CONSUMMATION OF THESE ORDERS
THAT'S TRUE ANSWERED ANOTHER HE SEEMS TO HAVE A SORT OF NATURAL WAY WITH HIM
SCARCELY HAD THEY GAINED THE SHADE OF THE THICK UNDERGROWTH WHEN A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A SCORE OF CANNONS RANG UPON THE NIGHT AIR AND HIGH IN THE AIR SOARED A BODY OF FLAME AND WRECK IN TERRIFIC CONFUSION
WITH A SPEED THAT WAS IN ITSELF EXHILARATING TO HER YOUNG COMMANDER WHO STILL GAZED IDLY AT THE PASSING CURRENT ONCE OR TWICE A SLIGHT FROWN CLOUDED HIS FEATURES AND HIS LIPS MOVED AS THOUGH HE WAS STRIVING WITHIN HIMSELF
THEN GLANCED AT HIS WELL FILLED SAILS AS THOUGH HE WAS LOTH TO LOSE EVEN A MINUTE OF SUCH A FAIR WIND HE DELAYED HOWEVER BUT A SECOND WHEN JUMPING DOWN TO THE DECK AGAIN HE ISSUED HIS ORDERS IN THOSE BRIEF BUT SIGNIFICANT TONES OF VOICE
THE CAPTAIN SCARCELY WAITED FOR HIS LAND TACKLE TO HOLD THE VESSEL BEFORE A QUARTER BOAT WAS LOWERED AWAY AND WITH A HALF DOZEN STURDY FELLOWS AS ITS CREW PULLED BOLDLY TOWARDS THE MAIN LANDING WHERE HE STEPPED ASHORE AND DISAPPEARED
AS WELL ITS GIVING HER INCREASED VELOCITY BY BRINGING MORE CANVASS TO DRAW THAN A SQUARE RIG COULD DO WHEN CLOSE HAULED BUT A SHREWD OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN LED TO ASK WHAT OTHER REASON SAVE THAT OF DISGUISE
ANOTHER FORESAIL WAS NOW BENT AND THIS TIME DOUBLE REEFED THE FORETOPSAIL TOO WAS BENT CLOSE REEFED AND FURLED WHILE THE FORE AND AFT FORESAIL WAS ONCE MORE STOWED
THOUGH HE DID SOMETIMES WORK UP A HAND'S OLD IRON PRETTY CLOSE FOR HIM
SHE HAD TREACHEROUSLY BROUGHT TO HER FATHER'S DOORS HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG AT THE FACTORY THEREFORE ON LANDING AFTER THE DUEL BEFORE MAUD SOUGHT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH HIM
AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE BEEN REVENGED IN ANY WAY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF THEIR FEELINGS UPON HER WHOM HE SO FONDLY LOVED WITH THIS SIMILARITY OF SENTIMENT IT WAS NOT SINGULAR THAT THEY SHOULD ERE LONG DISCOVER THEMSELVES AND FEELINGS TO EACH OTHER
IT WAS SCARCELY A DAY'S SAIL BEYOND THE FLOW OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA THAT ONE OF THOSE NOBLEST RESULTS OF MAN'S HANDIWORK A FINE SHIP MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN GRACEFULLY PLOUGHING HER COURSE THROUGH THE SKY BLUE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC
WAS TURNED OVER TO DUTY AGAIN I DIDN'T FORGET THAT FAVOR MESSMATES AND SINK ME IF I WOULDN'T GO TO THE BOTTOM TO SERVE HIM ANY TIME HE COMMANDED A BRIG IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE AFTER THAT AND WOULD HAVE MADE A MATE OF ME
AND THE NATIVE POWER OF HER BOSOM FOR REVENGE SEEMED TO BE NOW THE FOOD UPON WHICH SHE SUSTAINED LIFE ITSELF TAKING HER LONELY PLACE IN THE CABIN AFTER THE CONVERSATION JUST REFERRED TO SHE AGAIN HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
IT WAS A TELL TALE DROP OF CRYSTAL THAT GLISTENED BUT ONE MOMENT THERE COULD IT HAVE BEEN FANCY WAS IT POSSIBLE HE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE MATTER ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF INTENSE IMPORTANCE IT HIS ESTIMATION
THERE IS MY HAND ON SO HONORABLE A RESOLUTION SAID MISS HUNTINGTON FRANKLY WHILE A SINGLE TEAR OF PLEASURE TREMBLED IN HER CLEAR LUSTROUS EYES THE YOUNG COMMANDER TOOK THE HAND RESPECTFULLY THAT WAITS EXTENDED TO HIM
AND PREPARING IT IN SUITABLE FORM FOR CAULKING THE SHIP'S SEAMS ONE OF THEIR NUMBER WAS SPINNING A YARN
AND HAD BEEN TOLD BY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE THAT HE MUST GO FORTHWITH ON BOARD HIS SHIP AS SUCH HE DESIRED TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER A REQUEST WHICH HIS RIVAL COULD HARDLY FIND GROUNDS FOR REFUSING
TO THE HARBOR OF SIERRA LEONE THIS CHAFED THE YOUNG COMMANDER'S SPIRIT SOMEWHAT
AND SOMEHOW I GOT RATHER MORE GROG ABOARD THAN I COULD STOW AND WHEN I CAME OFF THE CAPTAIN SWORE AT ME LIKE A PIRATE AND AFTER I GOT SOBER TRICED ME UP TO THE MAIN RIGGING FOR A ROUND DOZEN
EITHER HIS COMMANDER HAD PROHIBITED HIM OR HE FOUND THAT BY SPEAKING HE SHOULD IN SOME WAY COMPROMISE THE CREDIT OR HONOR OF ONE UPON WHOM HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED AS BEING LITTLE LESS THAN ONE OF A SUPERIOR ORDER OF BEINGS TO HIMSELF
THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD SEVERAL TIMES ASKED BUT IN VAIN UNTIL NOW
HALF IN DOUBT HALF HOPING IN ONE INSTANT HOW DIFFERENT AN ASPECT ALL THINGS WORE LIFE ITS AIMS THE PERSONS HE MET AT THE DOOR AS HE NOW PASSED OUT
HE WAS MORE PARTICULAR THAN USUAL THAT HIS ORDERS IN THE SMALLEST ITEM WERE STRICTLY OBSERVED AND THUS WITH HIS IRON WILL AND STRONG INTELLIGENCE HE MASTERED EVERY CONTINGENCY OF THE HOUR IMPARTING THAT INDISPENSABLE CONFIDENCE AMONG HIS PEOPLE
AS HE TRIED TO MAKE THE SAILS DRAW BY ALTERING THE VESSEL'S COURSE A POINT OR TWO MORE FREE HERE IT IS SURE ENOUGH SAID THE CAPTAIN FROM THE SOUTHWEST UP WITH THE MEN FORWARD ONCE MORE MISTER FAULKNER WE MUST HUMOR OUR BEAUTY
AND AS TO THAT MATTER THERE MAY BE THEM ON BOARD WHO SAY AS MUCH OF HIM THAT ISN'T FAR FROM THE TRUTH ANSWERED BILL MARLINE SEEIN HE STARTED SO ARLY ON THE SEA HE CAN'T TELL WHEN HE WASN'T THERE HIMSELF
YES HE LOVES THE WHITE WOMAN WHOM HE BROUGHT TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE THUS FAR AT ALL EVENTS MY GOOD GIRL WE HAVE MUTUAL CAUSE FOR HATE AND WE WILL WORK HEARTILY TOGETHER YOU KNOW WHERE HIS VESSEL LIES I DO
A FEW MEN WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THE HEEL OF THE BOWSPRIT ON THE FORECASTLE ONE OR TWO WERE BUSY IN THE WAIST COILING CABLE AN OFFICER OF SECOND OR THIRD CASTE A QUIET BUT DECIDED CHARACTER
BEYOND THE ORDINARY INTEREST THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCES HAD CAUSED HAD NOT THUS FAR BEEN ENTERTAINED BY HIM HAD THIS BEEN OTHERWISE HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DIFFERENTLY INTERPRETED MANY AGREEABLE TOKENS WHICH SHE HAD GRANTED HIM
WHILE HE WALKED ON WITH THE ENGLISH OFFICER AND HIS PEOPLE OVER THE GROUND THEY HAD JUST PASSED TOWARDS DON LEONARDO'S THERE BEING NOW NO FURTHER CAUSE FOR SECRECY THEY MARCHED OPENLY AND ENLIVENED THE WAY WITH MANY A RUDE JEST
ANY RIG BECOMES THE SEA WITCH ANSWERED THE OFFICER WITH EVIDENT PRIDE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED THE CAPTAIN LUFF SIR LUFF A BIT SO WELL HE CONTINUED TO THE MAN AT THE HELM WE WILL HAVE ALL OF HER WEATHERLY POINTS THAT SITE WILL GIVE
WHO WERE FITTING COMPANIONS FOR EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD NOT AS YET BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY ANY CHANCE SO AS TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER WE REFER TO CAPTAIN BRAMBLE AND MAUD THE QUADROON BOTH NOW HATED CAPTAIN RATLIN
AND WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH HER COUNTENANCE WAS CAPABLE OF SHE SCOWLED UPON HIS UPRIGHT FIGURE AND HANDSOME FEATURES
AND TO WHICH HIS MIND NOW WENT BACK EAGERLY TO RECALL AND CONSIDER UNDER THE NEW PHASE OF FEELING WHICH ACTUATED HIM HOW ELSE COULD HE INTERPRET THAT TEAR BUT AS SPRINGING FROM A HEART THAT WAS FULL OF KINDLY FEELING TOWARDS HIM
THE GALE STILL INCREASED AND EVERYTHING BEING NOW MADE SNUG ON BOARD THE SEA WITCH SHE WAS RUN BEFORE IT WITH ALMOST INCREDIBLE SPEED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STUDY TO HAVE REGARDED THE CALM SELF POSSESSION AND COMPLETE COOLNESS OF THE YOUNG COMMANDER
WHILE HE REGARDED THE INCREASING GALE AY SIR YOU CAN DRIVE HER AT ALMOST ANY SPEED ANSWERED THE MATE SHE'S LIKE A METTLED COURSER SIR AND LOVES THE FLEET TRACK SCUD WHILE YOU CAN MISTER FAULKNER IT'S A TRUE NAUTICAL RULE
CHAPTER TWELVE THE CONFLICT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE HAD DESPERATE MEN TO DEAL WITH IN THE TAKING OF A SLAVER ON THE COAST BUT HE HAD GATHERED HIS EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES IN SUCH A STRONG ARRAY
UNTUTORED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AND FASHIONABLE INTRIGUE YET THE QUADROON SAW VERY CLEARLY THAT THROUGH CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SHE MIGHT CONSUMMATE THAT REVENGE WHICH SHE HAD SO SIGNALLY FAILED IN DOING BY THE AGENCY OF THE HOSTILE NEGRO TRIBES
AND IF YOU HAD LOOKED IN BOARD OVER HER BULWARKS YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HER COMPLEMENT WAS MADE UP OF MEN THERE WERE NONE THERE BUT REAL ABLE BODIED SEAMEN SEA DOGS WHO HAD ROUGHED IT IN ALL WEATHER AND ON ALL SORTS OF ALLOWANCE
CALL THE WATCH BELOW MISTER FAULKNER WE WILL TREAT OUR MISTRESS TO A NEW DRESS THIS BRIGHT DAY AND FLATTER HER PRIDE A LITTLE SHE IS OF THE COQUETTE SCHOOL AND WILL BEAR A LITTLE DALLIANCE
INDEED MAUD WHO HAD BEEN A SECRET WITNESS OF THE DEED ALREADY REALIZED THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE WAS THE ENEMY OF HIM WHOM SHE HAD ONCE LOVED AND WHOM SHE NOW SO BITTERLY DESPISED
SEEMED SATISFIED AT A SINGLE GLANCE AS TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND WALKING UP TO THE YOUNG COMMANDER AND WATCHING FOR A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY WHEN NOT OVERHEARD HE ASKED SIGNIFICANTLY TREACHERY YES WHOM
HE IS AND BUT NOW AWAITS THE GATHERING OF A CARGO IN MY FATHER'S BARRACOONS TO SAIL WITH THEM TO THE WEST INDIES IT IS NOT HIS FIRST VOYAGE EITHER BUT WHERE IS HIS VESSEL
AT FIRST YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED HIM A SUPERCARGO AN OWNER'S SON AS PASSENGER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT FROM THE QUITE AT HOME AIR HE EXHIBITED BUT NOW AND THEN HE CAST ONE OF THOSE SEARCHING AND UNDERSTANDING GLANCES ALOFT AND FORE AND AFT
YOU ARE AN ENGLISH OFFICER AGENT OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AND SENT HERE TO SUPPRESS THIS VILE TRAFFIC TRUE AND HAVE YOU SUSPECTED NOTHING SINCE YOUR VESSEL HAS BEEN HERE I SUSPECT THAT THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN IS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TRADE
IF WE EXCEPT THE DAY BEFORE THE LATE ATTACK OF THE NEGROES UPON THE HOUSE WHEN THE SAME TREACHEROUS ASSUMPTION OF CHEERFULNESS AND SATISFACTION WITH ALL PARTIES WAS SIMILARLY ASSUMED CAPTAIN RATLIN ON HIS PART WAS EVER THE SAME
THESE WERE TONES THAT THE CREW OF THE SEA WITCH WERE NO STRANGERS TO AND SOUNDS THEY LOVED FOR THEY BETOKENED A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE FEELING OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN COMMANDER AND MEN AND THEY WORKED WITH SPIRIT
IF THE CONTROLLING MIND UNDERSTANDS HIS POSITION ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE WEARS THAT DRESS AS THOUGH IT SUITED HER TASTE EXACTLY MISTER FAULKNER SAID THE CAPTAIN RUNNING HIS EYE OVER THE VESSEL AND GLANCING OVER THE SIDE TO MARK HER HEADWAY
AND REMAINED WITH HER HEAD BOWED IN HER LAP FOR A LONG LONG WHILE HALF DREAMING HALF WAKING POOR UNTUTORED UNCIVILIZED CHILD OF NATURE
A DOUBLE HEART SHOULD BE DEALT DOUBLY WITH IT WAS I WHO LED THESE PEOPLE HITHER AND I HOPED THE FATE OF SO MANY OF YOUR SHIP'S COMPANY MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOURS BUT YOU ARE A PRISONER NOW AND THERE'S HOPE YET MAUD MAUD
WHY LOOK YE MESSMATES ARNT YOU SATISFIED SO LONG AS THE ARTICLES YOU SIGNED ARE KEPT BY CAPTAIN AND CREW ASKED BILL MARLINE SOMEWHAT TARTLY WHY YES AS TO THAT MATTER BUT WHERE ARE WE BOUND BILL ASKED THE OTHER
WHICH GRATED HARSHLY UPON THE EARS OF THE WOUNDED WHO WERE BORNE UPON LITTERS MADE FROM BRANCHES OF THE HARD DRY LEAVES OF THE PALM AS THEY CAME UPON THE OPEN SPOT WHERE STAND THE BARRACOONS AND DON LEONARDO'S DWELLING
AND THAT TO PUSH A SUIT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NOT ONLY INDELICATE BUT POSITIVELY INSULTING AND YET HE DID SO TRUE HE DID NOT ACTUALLY IMPORTUNE MISS HUNTINGTON
AIDED BY THAT GAUDY PAINTER AND FANCY COLORER HOPE HAD CONJURED UP BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE BUT THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE PICTURE WAS AT HAND AND NOW HE PAUSED TO ASK HIMSELF SERIOUSLY CAN THIS BE
UNDER PRETENCE THAT HE FEARED HIS PRISONER WOULD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE HE KEPT HIM UNDER CLOSE GUARD
UNTIL TOWARDS ITS CLOSE CAPTAIN BRAMBLE FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN INTO THE FORECASTLE WITH A NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT SAW THE MATE OF THE SEA WITCH WITH THOSE OF HIS PEOPLE THAT WERE LEFT ALIVE HASTENING TO EMBARK IN A QUARTERBOAT
AND THE VESSEL FLEW LIKE A COURSER THE CHANGE OF WIND HAD BROUGHT THE SEA UP AND THE VESSEL HAD A GRADUAL ROLL CAUSING THE WAVES NOW AND THEN TO COME GRACEFULLY IN OVER THE WAIST WHILE THE EXTREME FORE AND AFT PARTS OF THE HANDSOME CRAFT
AND LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF VOICES WHICH HAVE A STRANGE AND ECHO LIKE SOUND IN THAT WILD AND TANGLED SPOT HARK THOSE VOICES ARE NOT FROM THE TONGUES OF NATIVES THAT IS ENGLISH WHICH THEY SPEAK
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SAYS HE SHALL SAIL SOON AND THEN WE CAN GO ROUND TO SIERRA LEONE AND FROM THENCE TAKE PASSAGE DIRECT FOR ENGLAND FOR MY PART I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE INSISTS UPON STAYING HERE SO LONG
SPRANG LIGHTLY INTO THE MIZZEN SHROUDS AND WITH A VOICE THAT WAS HEARD BY EVERY SOUL ON BOARD THE SEA WITCH SHOUTED STERNLY SILENCE IN THE SHIP NOT A VOICE WAS HEARD AND EVERY MAN QUIETLY AWAITED HIS ORDER
AND WITH A FEW QUICK BLOWS WITH A HANDSPIKE AND A CLEAR CALL HE SUMMONED THAT PORTION OF THE CREW WHOSE HOURS OF RELEASE FROM DUTY PERMITTED THEM BELOW THE SIGNAL RANG SHARPLY THROUGH THE SHIP AND CAUSED AN INSTANT RESPONSE A SCORE OF DARK FORMS ISSUED FORTH FROM THE FORECASTLE
A FEW MINUTES MORE AND THE FOREMAST PASSED THROUGH THE SAME METAMORPHOSE LEAVING THE SEA WITCH A THREE MASTED SCHOONER WITH FORE AND AFT SAILS ON EVERY MAST AND EVERY STAY
IMPRESSIBLE AND READY TO FOLLOW HER SIMPLEST INSTRUCTIONS ALL THIS BETOKENED A NATIVE REFINEMENT OF SOUL ELSE HE COULD NEVER HAVE EVINCED THE PLIABILITY WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM SO PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE A COMPANION TO HER HE SECRETLY LOVED
AND STROVE TO MAKE THEIR POSITION AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM WHILE THEY WERE ON BOARD BUT HE HAD NOT THE NICE SENSE OF HONOR THAT TRUE DELICACY OF SPIRIT WHICH SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO REMEMBER THEY WERE HIS GUESTS FROM NECESSITY
AND BENDING OVER THE FAIR HAND HE HELD HE PRESSED IT GENTLY TO HIS LIPS HE WAS NOT REPULSED NOR CHIDED BUT SHE DELICATELY ROSE AND TURNED TO HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT HOW SMALL A THINGS WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE TENOR OF A LIFE TIME
BILL MARLINE EVIDENTLY FOUND HIMSELF TREADING UPON DANGEROUS GROUND AND WISELY CUT SHORT HIS YARN THEREBY CREATING A VAST AMOUNT OF CURIOSITY AMONG HIS MESSMATES BUT HE STERNLY REFUSED TO SPEAK FURTHER UPON THE SUBJECT
HOW WAS THAT MATTER BILL ASKED ONE OF HIS MESSMATES THEY SAY YOU HAVE KEPT THE CAPTAIN'S RECKONING MAN AND BOY THESE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT HAVE I AND NEVER A TRUER HEART FLOATED THAN THE MAN YOU SEE YONDER LEANING OVER THE RAIL ON THE QUARTERDECK WHERE HE BELONGS
THE ENGLISH OFFICER LOOKED UPON HER WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ADMIRATION FOR HER STRANGE BEAUTY WITH CONTEMPT FOR HER TREACHERY AND WITH A THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT BE MADE PERHAPS THE SUBJECT OF HIS PLEASURE BY A LITTLE MANAGEMENT BY AND BY
BUT THE BOY WAS CRAZY FOR NEAR A MONTH FROM THE BLOW ON HIS HEAD WHICH HE GOT IN FALLING BUT HE GRADUALLY GOT CURED UNDER OUR CAPTAIN'S CARE WELL DO YE SEE OUR CAPTAIN WAS A REGULAR WHOLE SOULED FELLOW
KNOWS THAT SUCH A COURSE STEERED FROM THE WEST INDIES WILL IF WELL FOLLOWED RUN DOWN THE CAPE VERDS THAT'S ALL I KNOW PORT PRAYA AND A PORT THAT WAS IN THE ARTICLES SURE ENOUGH ANSWERED HE WHO HAD QUESTIONED BILL MARLINE
AS HE BEHELD THE SHIP BOWLING GRACEFULLY ON HER COURSE BY THE POWER OF THE TRADE WINDS THAT SO CONSTANTLY BEFRIEND THE MARINERS IN THESE LATITUDES
PAY OUT OLD FELLOW THERE'S PLENTY OF SEA ROOM AND NO LAND SHARKS TO FEAR SAID ONE OF THE GROUP ENCOURAGINGLY NEVER YOU MIND MESSMATES THERE'S NOTHING LIKE KEEPING A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD ESPECIALLY BEING QUIET ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS ADDED BILL
HOW MANY DO THEY NUMBER I KNOW NOT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT CONTINUED THE ENGLISHMAN TURNING TO HIS FOLLOWERS AND IN A LOW VOICE BIDDING THEM LOOK TO THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE GAME WAS NEAR AT HAND
AND WHO WOULD BE ONLY TOO MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE BRINGING BEFORE THEM OF AN OFFENDER TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM CAPTAIN BRAMBLE OF COURSE OFFERED TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER HIS OWN CABIN FOR THEIR GREATER COMFORT
TOLD OF MANLINESS OF HEART AND CHIVALRIC HARDIHOOD OF CHARACTER EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS HAD BRONZED HIS SKIN BUT THERE WERE NO WRINKLES THERE AND CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN COULD NOT HAVE SEEN MORE THAN TWO AND TWENTY YEARS
HAVING TREMENDOUS SQUARE YARDS ENABLING THE CANVASS TO ACT MORE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE HULL INSTEAD OF OPERATING AS A LEVER ALOFT AND KEEPING THE SHIP CONSTANTLY OFF AN EVEN KEEL
AND I AM NOT ONE TO MISS MY AIM AS YOUR VALIANT LEADER YONDER WELL KNOWS NOW CAPTAIN BRAMBLE I WILL SURRENDER TO YOU PROVIDED YOU ACCEDE TO MY TERMS OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT TAKE ME ALIVE WELL SIR
I NEVER SEED A BETTER SEAMAN OF TWICE HIS YEARS ALWAYS SAVIN PRESENT COMPANY MESSMATES IN COURSE BILL GROWLED THREE OR FOUR OF HIS MESSMATES HEARTILY WELL DO YE SEE MESSMATES WE CONTINUED TOGETHER IN THE SAME SHIP FOR THE MATTER OF FIVE YEARS
HERE IT IS AGAIN ADDED THE MATE AS THE WIND HAULED ONCE MORE THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF THE CHANGE IN THE VESSEL'S RIG WHICH WE HAVE DESCRIBED WAS AT ONCE APPARENT ENABLING THE VESSEL TO LIE NEARER THE WIND IN HER COURSE
CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN THE WATCH BELOW AFTER COMPLETING THE WORK WHICH HAD SUMMONED THEM FOR THE TIME BEING ON DECK TUMBLED HELTER SKELTER DOWN THE FORE HATCH ONCE MORE
SO REQUISITE TO PERFECT CONTROL THERE WAS A FIRMNESS NOW EXPRESSED IN THE COMPRESSED LIPS AND A STERNNESS IN THE EYE THAT HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN MANIFESTED WHILE THERE WAS A BREATHING OF AUTHORITY IN HIS SMALLEST ORDER
CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN SEIZE HIM MY MEN SEIZE HIM AND BIND HIS ARMS HE IS OUR PRISONER SAID THE ENGLISH OFFICER BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU GIVE SUCH AN ORDER AS THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE ASKED THE YOUNG COMMANDER IN THE QUEEN'S NAME SIR
TRIFLES LIGHTER THAN STRAWS ARE LEVERS IN THE BUILDING UP OF DESTINY CAPTAIN RATLIN TURNED FROM THAT BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH A FEELING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE IDEA THAT MISS HUNTINGTON REALLY CARED FOR HIM
WHICH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE PREPARATION FOR MY APPROACHING TETE A TETE WITH HIS MOODY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE WIFE BUT I WAS NOT DESTINED TO UNDERGO THE CONTEMPLATED ORDEAL THIS EVENING GUESTS WERE ANNOUNCED
MISSUS PACKARD WOULD THINK IT STRANGE IF SHE SAW WHERE AND MIGHT MAKE IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME BUT YOU CAN GET WHAT I WANT WITHOUT TROUBLE IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF GOING ABOUT THE HOUSE AT NIGHT
AND THE SOUND OF THE PIANO AND CHEERFUL TALKING JUST ACROSS THE HALL WITHOUT THE SENSE OF THE MORBID AND UNEARTHLY ENTERING MY MATTER OF FACT BRAIN UTTERING AN EJACULATION OF CONTEMPT I RESEATED MYSELF THE IMPULSE CAME AGAIN TO LOOK BEHIND ME
IN ONE ALREADY KEYED UP TO AN EXPECTATION OF THE MYSTERIOUS AND UNUSUAL IF SO I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED MY FEATURES CERTAINLY BETRAYED THE EFFECT OF THIS UNEXPECTED ATTACK UPON MY PROFESSIONAL EQUANIMITY WHAT DID THE GIRL MEAN
BUT HE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH THAT CURIOUS CONCENTRATED GAZE WHICH I HAD MET TWICE BEFORE SINCE COMING INTO THIS HOUSE I NEED NOTHING SAID I
HE FALTERED TO HIS FEET AGAIN SAYING HUMBLY AS HE CREPT AWAY I COULDN'T HELP IT YOUR HONOR
LET THEM COME HERE AND SEE THIS MORNING I SHALL ISSUE INVITATIONS FOR A DINNER TO BE GIVEN THE FIRST NIGHT YOU CAN ASSURE ME MISTER PACKARD WILL BE AT HOME DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SUCH NIGHT ON FRIDAY WEEK
RATHER WILL YOU SHOW ME THE GREAT KINDNESS OF SITTING ON THAT LOW DIVAN BY THE FIREPLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT BE VISIBLE SEE YOU MAY HAVE MY WORK TO BUSY YOURSELF WITH AND IF HE MAY NOT YOU KNOW
IF SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT A WOMAN LIKE MYSELF WORKS BETTER WHEN HER FEELINGS ARE ROUSED ANSWERING WITH A SMILE I WAITED PATIENTLY WHILE HE TALKED TERMS AND OTHER EQUALLY NECESSARY DETAILS
WE ARE QUITE SURROUNDED THE HOUSE SHOULD CERTAINLY HOLD TREASURE TO WARRANT ALL THIS INTEREST BUT WHAT COULD THIS ONE TIME DOMESTIC KNOW OF THE MISSING BONDS AN OLD FASHIONED DOORWAY I REMARKED
I CLOSED THE LITTLE VOLUME WITH VERY STRANGE THOUGHTS IF MAYOR PACKARD HAD BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION OF HIS WIFE'S STRANGE CONDITION IN THE CONFESSION SHE HAD MADE
THESE HALF HEARTED VOTERS THEIR EASILY STIFLED CONVICTIONS ARE WHAT MAKE MAJORITIES SHE STAMMERED MISTER STEELE MAY HAVE BOWED HE PROBABLY DID FOR SHE WENT ON CONFIDENTLY AND WITH A CERTAIN AUTHORITY
THAT IS WHY I HAVE CALLED IN HELP THAT IS WHY I HAVE CALLED YOU IN THE EMPHASIS WAS DELICATELY BUT SINCERELY GIVEN IT STRUCK MY HEART AND ENTERED IT
HOW LARGE IS IT I ASKED QUITE AS BREATHLESS AS HERSELF AS I REALIZED THE POSSIBILITIES UNDERLYING THIS REMARKABLE REQUEST IT IS SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN CONCEAL IT UNDER
WITH CHEERFUL COMPOSURE WHAT SHOULD I HAVE THOUGHT IF AT THAT MOMENT I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT APPEARANCES WERE DECEITFUL AND THAT THERE WERE MANY PERSONS THEN LIVING WHO IF LEFT TO THEIR CHOICE WOULD PREFER LIFE IN THE DISMAL WALLS FROM WHICH I HAD INSTINCTIVELY TURNED
FATHER AND SON THANK YOU I AM INDEBTED TO YOU MISTER STEELE FOR THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH YOU HAVE MET AND ANSWERED MY DOUBTS HE MADE SOME REPLY ADDED SOMETHING ABOUT NOT SEEING HER AGAIN
WHICH NAME STEELE OR BRAINARD YOU ACKNOWLEDGED BOTH MY REAL NAME IS BRAINARD THEREFORE IT IS ALSO HERS BUT I SHALL BE CONTENT IF SHE WILL TAKE MY PRESENT ONE OF STEELE
THAT YOUR WORK IS A TRAITOR'S WORK THAT THE GLORIFICATION YOU SPEAK OF IS FALSE THAT YOU MAY TALK IN MY FAVOR
OF THE MYSTERIOUS EVENT WHICH HAD THROWN SUCH A CLOUD OVER HER LIFE WHEN MOVED BY SOME UNACCOUNTABLE INFLUENCE I GLANCED UP AND SAW NIXON STANDING IN THE OPEN DOORWAY GAZING AT ME
IT DID NOT TAKE ME LONG TO PUT AWAY MY FEW BELONGINGS AND PREPARE FOR DINNER WHEN QUITE READY I SAT DOWN TO WRITE A LETTER THIS COMPLETED I TURNED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND THAT WON'T KILL ME WHATEVER EFFECT IT MAY HAVE ON THE PARTY HENRY HER VOICE HAD CHANGED TO ONE MORE NATURAL ALSO HER MANNER THE CONFIDENCE EXPRESSED IN THIS OUTBURST THE VITALITY
HE STARED SHOOK HIMSELF TOGETHER AND QUIETLY REMARKED I AM HENRY PACKARD THE CITY'S MAYOR AND NOT ONLY THAT THE RUNNING CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR I KNEW HIM WELL BY NAME EVEN IF I DID NOT KNOW OR
SHE DID NOT CATCH HIS NAME I REMEMBER PARDON ME WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY SHE DID NOT CATCH HIS NAME FOR LATER SHE ASKED ME WHAT IT WAS TELL ME ABOUT THAT MISTER PACKARD IT IS IMMATERIAL BUT I AM READY TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
A WOMAN STOOD AT ONE OF THESE TABLES UNTANGLING A SKEIN OF RED YARN BEHIND HER I SAW ANOTHER LEANING IN AN ABSTRACTED WAY OVER A COUNTER WHICH RAN FROM WALL TO WALL
AS TWO SCREAMS RANG OUT ABOVE AND TWO AGITATED FACES PEERED DOWN UPON US I'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND A GREAT ADVENTURE BUT I'VE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE GHOST IT WAS JUST ONE OF THE TWO POOR OLD LADIES NEXT DOOR
THE HINT CONVEYED IN THE LAST PHRASE GAVE ME COURAGE TO SAY YOU WISH ME TO REACH HER WITH COMFORT SAID HE AND IF IN DOING SO I LEARN HER TROUBLE YOU WILL WIN MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE
AS WE REACHED THE LOWER STEP SHE PASSED US ON HER WAY TO THE LIBRARY WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD TAKEN HER TO THE STUDY WHICH SHE WAS SUPPOSED NOT TO VISIT
I SEEM TO BE STARING THERE STILL WAITING FOR THE BLOW DESTINED TO SHATTER THIS HOUSEHOLD NONSENSE GIVE ME A KISS AND FIX YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL WHAT WE HAVE TO FEAR AND ALL WE HAVE TO FEAR IS THAT I MAY LOSE MY ELECTION
IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE AND NOW THREE WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION WHILE EVERY OPPOSING FORCE WAS COMING TO THE SURFACE THIS TROUBLE HAD COME UPON HIM A MYSTERY IN HIS HOME AND THREATENED DEATH IN HIS HEART
SHE WAS BACK IN THE LIBRARY FINGERING HER HAT AND LISTENING AS IT SEEMED TO ME TO EVERYTHING BUT MY VOICE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT MAKING ONE MORE EFFORT I CAME UP CLOSE TO HER AND IMPETUOUSLY CRIED OUT
MISSUS PACKARD WHEN FREE AND LIGHT HEARTED WAS A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION AND THE MEAL PASSED OFF CHEERILY WHEN WE ROSE AND THE MAYOR LEFT US FOR SOME NECESSARY BUSINESS IT WAS WITH A LOOK OF SATISFACTION IN MY DIRECTION
I PERCEIVED THE PIECE OF PAPER SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FROM THE DINING ROOM AND HAD DOUBTLESS DROPPED IN THE COURSE OF THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION RUNNING DOWN IN GREAT HASTE I PICKED IT UP THIS SCRAP OF I KNEW NOT WHAT
NO NOT THE DEVIL BUT YOURSELF YOU EVEN THE YOU OF SEVEN YEARS BACK WOULD NOT HAVE LIVED IN ANY COUNTRY TOWN IF NECESSITY OR LET US SAY SAFETY HAD NOT DEMANDED IT YOU WITH YOUR LOOKS AND YOUR AMBITIONS
TILL THIS MATTER CAN BE LEGALLY SETTLED I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE MYSELF HATEFUL TO HER FOR I ANTICIPATE THE DAY WHEN SHE WILL BE MY WIFE IN HEART AS SHE IS NOW IN LAW NEVER THE WORD RANG OUT IN TRUE WOMANLY REVOLT
I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE THE MAYOR FLUSHED INDIGNATION GAVE HIM VEHEMENCE THEN HE CRIED
AND A STRONG LIGHT WAS SHINING ON IT AND ON ME FROM A LAMP ON A NEAR BY TABLE THE STORY WAS INTERESTING AND I WAS FOLLOWING THE ADVENTURES IT WAS RELATING WITH EAGER INTEREST WHEN SUDDENLY THE CHARACTER OF THE LIGHT CHANGED
HE REPLIED LIFTING INTO VIEW THE OBJECT WE HAD SEEN AT ONE SIDE OF THE PASSAGE AND WHICH NOW SHOWED ITSELF TO BE A PAIR OF FOLDING STEPS
TO A SINGLE NIGHT SPENT IN THE PROMISING HOUSE I WAS SO EAGER TO ENTER AN OLD SERVING MAN WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH STRUCK ME PLEASANTLY ENOUGH AT THE TIME OPENED THE DOOR IN RESPONSE TO MY RING
YOU SAW THIS FORM BETWEEN YOU AND THE LIGHTED LAMP HOW LONG DID IT STAY THERE AND WHAT BECAME OF IT I CAN NOT TELL YOU ONE MOMENT IT WAS THERE AND THE NEXT IT WAS GONE AND I FOUND MYSELF STARING INTO VACANCY
AS ONE OF INQUIRY AND WONDER BUT NEITHER INQUIRY NOR WONDER DESCRIBED THE PRESENT SITUATION AND I PUT MYSELF UPON MY GUARD SEEING ME LOOK HER WAY SHE FLUSHED AND THROWING WIDE THE DOOR REMARKED IN THE PLEASANTEST OF TONES
THE MASCULINE ATTITUDE HE TOOK WERE PRODUCING THEIR EFFECT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAW OR IN MY FEARS PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT I AM READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS I WILL TRY TO LOOK UPON IT ALL AS A FREAK OF MY IMAGINATION
WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON THAT DAY HAD SHE BEEN OUT YES I THINK SHE TOLD ME LATER THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUT DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO SOME CONCERT I BELIEVE I DID NOT PRESS HER WITH QUESTIONS MISS SAUNDERS
I SOFTLY REPEATED WAIT FOR WHAT FOR FORTUNE TO ENTER YOUR LITTLE SHOP DOOR NO FOR MY HUSBAND TO COME BACK WAS HER UNEXPECTED ANSWER UTTERED GRIMLY ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIGHTENED THAT HUSBAND AWAY AGAIN
MISTER STEELE I DO NOT MEAN YOU TO DISTURB MY HOUSE OR TO ROB ME OF MY WIFE WHAT WAS YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU MET OLYMPIA BREWSTER A PAUSE THE SLIGHTEST IN THE WORLD BUT THE KEEN EYE OF THE ASTUTE LAWYER NOTED IT
SHE HAS PASSED ME BY MY HEART GOES DOWN DOWN WHEN SUDDENLY HER LOOK RETURNS AND SHE SINGLES ME OUT MISS SAUNDERS THEN I HAVE A WORD TO SAY TO YOU THERE IS A RUSTLE ABOUT ME
HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE ABOVE AND BELOW LAY SCRAPS OF TORN UP PAPER AND ON MANY IF NOT ON ALL OF THEM COULD BE SEEN THE BROKEN SQUARES AND INVERTED ANGLES WHICH HAD MARKED SO CURIOUSLY THE SURFACE OF THE ENVELOPE SHE HAD HANDED TO MISTER STEELE
AND SEEING ME ALONE CAME FORWARD BRISKLY MISSUS PACKARD HAS COMPANY AND I AM ON MY WAY TO THE DRAWING ROOM BUT I AM HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASSURING YOU THAT ALREADY SHE LOOKS BETTER AND THAT I BEGIN TO HOPE THAT YOUR ENCOURAGING PRESENCE MAY STIMULATE HER
I STOPPED HER AS SHE WAS MOVING ON AND VENTURED A SINGLE QUERY THIS POSITION INVOLVING SECRECY IS IT ONE YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TO TAKE EVEN IF I DID NOT STAND IN NEED OF IT SO BADLY YES
I NOTED ONE THING AND ONLY ONE THING ON ENTERING THIS PLACE THAT WAS THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO SAT AT A DISTANT TABLE READING AND MAKING NOTES BUT AS MAYOR PACKARD TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM KNOWING AND EXPECTING HIM TO BE THERE NO DOUBT
WITH THIS I TURNED SQUARELY ABOUT AND LOOKED DIRECTLY AT HER WHOM I BELIEVED TO BE BESS A VOLUBLE ANSWER FROM THE WOMAN AT MY SIDE BUT NOT THE WINK OF AN EYE FROM THE ONE WHOSE ATTENTION I HAD ENDEAVORED TO ATTRACT
WHY WERE PEOPLE AFRAID TO REMAIN IN THIS HOUSE WHY DID THE OLD WOMAN NEXT DOOR SHOW SUCH INTEREST IN THE NEW MEMBER OF HER NEIGHBOR'S HOUSEHOLD WOULD A SINGLE ANSWER COVER ALL WAS THERE BUT ONE CAUSE FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PECULIARITIES
WHEN SHE PROPOSED MY AWAITING HER THERE THERE WERE BUREAU DRAWERS WITH THEIR CONTENTS HALF ON THE FLOOR BOXES WITH THEIR COVERS OFF CUPBOARD DOORS AJAR AND EVEN THE CLOSET SHELVES SHOWING EVERY MARK OF A FRENZIED SEARCH AMONG THEM
WHEN THE TIME COMES FROM GOING INTO THAT CELLAR AT NIGHT I SHOOK MY HEAD I HAD ALREADY REGAINED BOTH MY WILL POWER AND THE RESOLUTION TO CARRY OUT THIS ADVENTURE TO THE END
I FELT WAS DESTINED TO BE THE SCENE OF MANY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS ITS FIRST EFFECT HAD BEEN A CHEERFUL ONE OWING TO ITS TWO LARGE WINDOWS ONE LOOKING OUT ON A STRETCH OF CLEAR SKY ABOVE A MASS OF LOW HUDDLED BUILDINGS
THEN GRADUALLY SHE DREW BACK AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOOR WHICH SHE FORGOT TO SHUT AS WE COULD TELL FROM THE GRADUALLY RECEDING LIGHT AND THE FAINT FALL OF HER FOOTSTEPS AFTER THE LAST DIM FLICKER HAD FADED AWAY
DEAR DEARIE OF A BABY HOW CAN I HELP IT AND WHIRLING ABOUT IN MY DIRECTION SHE HELD UP THE CHILD FOR INSPECTION CRYING ISN'T SHE A DARLING DO YOU WONDER AT MY HAPPINESS
ON ONE OF THESE BRICKS YOU WILL DETECT A CROSS SCRATCHED THAT'S THE ONE
HE ASKED ME IF I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ITS USE AND WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGED SOME SORT OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT HE DREW AN UNANSWERED LETTER FROM A PILE ON THE TABLE AND REQUESTED ME TO COPY IT AS A SAMPLE I IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN BEFORE THE TYPE WRITER
I HAD JUST COME FROM THE NURSERY AND THE MEMORY OF LAURA'S GOOD NIGHT KISS WAS MORE IN MY MIND THAN THE STORY I WAS FINISHING WHEN
HAD MISS DAVIES PURPOSELY WITHHELD HIS NAME I BEGAN TO THINK SO I HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE I WAS PROCEEDING
MAMA DEAR AND THE TENDER EMPHASIS ON THE ENDEARING WORD COMPLETED THE CHARM TEARS SPRANG TO MISSUS PACKARD'S EYES AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE PASSED THE CLINGING CHILD OVER TO THE NURSE
AND YOU WILL DO ME THE GREATEST FAVOR ONE MAN CAN SHOW ANOTHER MISTER STEELE BOWED I CAN NOT FOREGO THE FINAL CONSULTATION WE HAD PLANNED TO HOLD ON THE TRAIN MAY I RIDE DOWN WITH YOU TO THE STATION CERTAINLY MOST HAPPY
FOR ALL THE INTENTNESS OF HER LOOK THERE WAS NO INVITATION IN IT WARRANTING SUCH AN ADVANCE ON MY PART SHE SIMPLY STARED DOWN AT ME IN UNBROKEN ANXIETY NOR THOUGH I WATCHED HER FOR SOME MINUTES WITH AN INTENSITY EQUAL TO HER OWN
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER PREOCCUPATION TO SCRUTINIZE HER FEATURES MORE CLOSELY THAN I HAD DARED TO DO WHILE SHE WAS DIRECTLY ADDRESSING ME I FOUND THEM SET IN THE STERN MOLD OF PROFOUND FEELING WOMANLY FEELING NO DOUBT
BUT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF THE ENIGMATIC SCENE I HAD WITNESSED AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE NECESSARILY INTERESTED ME VERY MUCH AND I COULD NOT HELP GIVING IT A LOOK
I FOLLOWED HARD AFTER HIM AND BEING BRISK IN MY MOVEMENTS WAS AT HIS BACK BEFORE HE WAS HALF WAY TO THE BOTTOM HE SEEMED TO RESENT THIS
THE DOOR BELL HAD RUNG AND WE COULD HEAR NIXON IN THE HALL HASTENING TO ANSWER IT MISS SAUNDERS SHE HURRIEDLY INTERPOSED WITH A GREAT EFFORT TO SPEAK NATURALLY I HAVE TOLD NIXON THAT I WISH TO SEE MISTER STEELE IF HE COMES IN THIS MORNING
BY TELLING IT TO ONE WHO WOULD GIVE TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO ASSUAGE IT MY HEAD ROSE I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT MY NEXT STEP MUST STRIKE SOLID GROUND IN OTHER WORDS TO BE QUITE HONEST
FOR I HAD NODDED TO HER QUESTION I'M GREATLY INTERESTED IN THAT HOUSE
HE HAS AN UNCOMMON FACE A HANDSOME ONE DO YOU MEAN YES AND WELL WHAT I SHOULD CALL DISTINCTLY CLEVER HE IS CLEVER MY SECRETARY MISS SAUNDERS
AND IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE MANSION AND HOVEL CONFRONTING EACH OTHER FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET SHOULD I FIND THE NUMBER I SOUGHT ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE CRUDE UNMEANING DWELLINGS I WAS CONSTANTLY PASSING
THE CHILD'S DIMPLED WITH DELIGHT AT THE RAPID MOVEMENT A LOVELY PICTURE LETTY WHO STOOD WAITING IN THE DOORWAY SHOWED A COUNTENANCE FULL OF SURPRISE MISSUS PACKARD WAS THE FIRST TO FEEL TIRED
FOR THERE WERE EVIDENCES ABOUT THE HALL THAT IT WAS BEING THOROUGHLY SWEPT AS I ENDEAVORED TO PASS THE DOOR I INADVERTENTLY STRUCK THE EDGE OF A LITTLE TABORET STANDING IN MY WAY IT TOPPLED AND A LITTLE BOOK
I WILL WAIT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM TILL SHE RETURNS AND THEN TELL HER AT ONCE SHE CAN BLAME NOBODY BUT ME IF SHE IS DISPLEASED AT WHAT SHE SEES NIXON GRUMBLED SOMETHING AND MOVED OFF THE GIRLS FULL OF TALK
BUT HER IMAGE FOLLOWED ME AND I FORGOT IT ONLY WHEN CONFRONTED ONCE AGAIN WITH MISSUS PACKARD THAT LADY WAS AWAITING ME AT THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN THROWING OFF HER SECRET DEPRESSION AND SMILED QUITE NATURALLY AS I APPROACHED
CHAPTER FIFTEEN HARDLY A COINCIDENCE THE OLD LADY'S EYES MET OURS WITHOUT PURPOSE OR INTELLIGENCE IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE DID NOT SEE US
NOW YOU EXACT DETAILS WITH WHICH ONLY MISSUS PACKARD IS CONVERSANT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SERVANTS I DO NOT INTEREST MYSELF MUCH IN MATTERS PURELY DOMESTIC
NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE TONE OF HER PREVIOUS REMARKS YOU ARE RIGHT THE PARAGRAPH REFLECTING ON ME MUST BE TRACED TO ITS SOURCE THE LIE MUST BE MET AND GRAPPLED WITH
GAVE ME ANOTHER LOOK AND TOSSED THE PAPER INTO THE GRATE AS IT CAUGHT FIRE AND FLARED UP THE CHARACTERS STARTED VIVIDLY INTO VIEW THIS SECOND GLIMPSE OF THEM ADDED TO THE ONE ALREADY GIVEN ME FIXED THE WHOLE INDELIBLY IN MY MIND
YOUR EDUCATION AS A POLITICIAN HAS YET TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE YOU WILL BE FIT FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF A STATE I AM AN ADEPT AT THE GLORIFICATION OF THE PARTY OF THE MAN THAT IT SUITS MY PRESENT EXIGENCIES TO PROMOTE
WHEN I FOUND MY VOICE TRAILING OFF INTO SILENCE AND EVERY SENSE ALARMINGLY ALERT YET THERE WAS NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THIS WELL LIGHTED COZY FAMILY ROOM TO AWAKEN FEAR I WAS SURE OF THIS THE NEXT MINUTE
BUT IT IS ALL UNREAL ALL PHANTASMAGORIC EVEN YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVE AND O GOD MY BABY WHAT IS REAL AND DISTINCTIVE AN ABSOLUTE PART OF ME AND MY LIFE IS THAT SHAPE FROM THE DEAD WITH ITS THREATENING EYES WHICH PIERCE
AND ALL I'M SORRY FOR
THE MAYOR OUTRAGED IN EVERY SENTIMENT OF HONOR AS WELL AS IN THE MOST CHERISHED FEELINGS OF HIS HEART LOWERED UPON HIS UNMOVED SECRETARY WITH A WRATH WHICH WOULD HAVE BORNE DOWN ANY OTHER MAN BEFORE IT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU
I HAD NEVER BELIEVED IN SUCH THINGS NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM BUT IT WAS A WEEK AGO IN THE LIBRARY I HAVE NOT SEEN A HAPPY MOMENT SINCE MY DARLING YES YES I KNOW BUT IMAGINE I WAS SITTING READING
IT'S A LITTLE BOX WITH MY NAME ON IT AND IT IS HIDDEN WHERE BEHIND A BRICK I LOOSENED IN THE CELLAR WALL I CAN DESCRIBE THE VERY PLACE OH YOU THINK I AM ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU A STRANGER AND A LADY

BOTH SIDES OF WHICH ARE LINED WITH MAGNIFICENT FARMS WHOSE FIELDS AND MEADOWS FAIRLY GROAN BENEATH THEIR WEALTH OF PRODUCE WHOSE FRUCTIFEROUS ORCHARDS ARC MARVELS OF PRODUCTIVENESS
SPLENDID GRAVEL ROADS LEAD FROM CRUM'S POINT TO SOUTH BEND AND ON THROUGH MISHAWAKA ALTERNATING WITH SANDY STRETCHES TO GOSHEN WHICH TOWN IS SAID BY THE GOSHENITES TO BE THE PRETTIEST IN INDIANA
I SHOULD ORDER HIM TO LEAVE ME AND MAKES AN ELABORATE DISPLAY OF HIS PANTOMIMIC ABILITIES TO IMPRESS UPON ME THE INFORMATION THAT THE COUNTRY AHEAD IS FULL OF VERY BAD KOORDS
I DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO PAY AS LITTLE HEED TO THEM AS POSSIBLE SEEING THAT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF HALTING THEY COME RUNNING UP AND UNDERTAKE TO FORCIBLY DETAIN ME BY SEIZING HOLD OF THE BICYCLE
AND WHEN I DISMOUNT THEY CONDUCT ME AND THE BICYCLE AT ONCE INTO THE TENT OF THEIR CHIEFTAIN
BUT THE CERULEAN WAIST SCARF BESTOWED UPON ME BY OUR HUNGARIAN FRIEND IGALI AT BELGRADE NO LONGER ADDS ITS EMBELLISHMENTS TO MY PERSONAL ADORNMENTS WHENEVER A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS
THAT EXCITES THE ADMIRATION OF THEIR SEMI CIVILIZED MINDS THIS SCARF THEY WERE DOUBTLESS PENETRATING ENOUGH TO OBSERVE FORMED NO NECESSARY PART OF MY WARDROBE AND A DOZEN TIMES IN THE EVENING
KARDASH WHEN ACCOSTING ME THE DISTANCE IS NOW RECKONED BY FARSAKHS ROUGHLY FOUR MILES INSTEAD OF HOURS BUT ALTHOUGH THE FARSAKH IS A MORE TANGIBLE AND COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENT THAN THE TURKISH HOUR
WHEREAS HE HAS EVIDENTLY NOT EVEN EARNED THE PRIVILEGE OF WEARING A GREEN TURBAN HE HAS NEITHER BEEN TO MECCA HIMSELF DURING HIS WHOLE UNPROFITABLE LIFE NOR SENT A SUBSTITUTE
ON A STONE BRIDGE I FOLLOW ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE HEAD WATERS OF OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE KIZIL IRMAK
AT THE APPARITION OF A LONE WHEELMAN HERE ON THE CARAVAN ROADS OF PERSIA OF COURSE WE ARE MUTUALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER SERVANT
AT THE SAME TIME MAKING NO PRETENCE OF CONCEALING THEIR EAGER CURIOSITY CONCERNING THE PROBABLE CONTENTS OF MY LUGGAGE NATURALLY DISAPPROVING OF THIS ARBITRARY CONDUCT
LEADING THROUGH THE BROAD AND SMILING CATTARAUGUS VALLEY THAT IS SPREAD OUT LIKE A VAST GARDEN BELOW THROUGH WHICH CATTARAUGUS CREEK SLOWLY WINDS ITS TORTUOUS WAY STOPPING OVER NIGHT AT ANGOLA
PROM ANGORA I HAVE BROUGHT A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO MISTER ERNEST WEAKLEY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN ENGAGED TOGETHER WITH MISTER KODIGAS A BELGIAN GENTLEMAN
WATCHING THE FESTIVE MERRY MAKINGS OF THE MEN THEIR HEADS AND NECKS ARE RESPLENDENT WITH BANDS AND NECKLACES OF GOLD COINS IT STILL BEING A CUSTOM OF THE EAST TO LET THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY WEAR THE SURPLUS WEALTH ABOUT THEM IN THE SHAPE OF GOLD ORNAMENTS AND JEWELS
NO WHEELMAN HAS EVER YET RODE UP THIS HILL SAVE THE MUSCULAR AND GRITTY CAPTAIN OF THE FREDONIA CLUB THOUGH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED THE FEAT FROM THE TOP MY ROAD AHEAD IS PLAINLY VISIBLE FOR MILES
COMING TO LOAD UP THEIR BUFFALO ARABAS BY MOONLIGHT WITH THESE VERY SHOCKS OF WHEAT ONE OF THE ARABAS NOW APPROACHES THE SHOCK WHICH CONCEALS MY RECUMBENT FORM AND WHERE THE PALE MOONBEAMS ARE COQUETTISHLY OGLING THE NICKEL PLATED PORTIONS OF MY WHEEL
A BLOOD THIRSTY YOUNGSTER OF TEN OR TWELVE SUMMERS HE BECOMES WILDLY HILARIOUS GAMBOLING ABOUT THE TENT AND ROLLING OVER AND KICKING UP HIS HEELS HE THEN GOES TO THE SHEIKH
AND THE ENDS TIED TOGETHER OVER THE HEAD SUFFICIENTLY TIGHT TO PREVENT THEM OPENING THEIR EYES FALCONING IS CONSIDERED THE CHIEF OUT DOOR SPORT OF THE PERSIAN NOBILITY
RAGGED URCHINS ROMP WITH DOGS AND BABY BUFFALOES WHERE PASHAS SONS FORMERLY CONGREGATED TO LEARN WISDOM FROM THE TEACHINGS OF THEIR PROPHET AND NOW WHAT REMAINS OF THE INTRICATE ARABESQUE DESIGNS WORKED OUT IN SMALL BRIGHT COLORED TILES
AND A NICE BOWL OF YAORT OFF WHICH I MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL BREAKFAST NEAR BY WHERE I AM EATING ARE FIVE INDUSTRIOUS MAIDENS PREPARING CRACKED OR BROKEN WHEAT BY A NOVEL AND INTERESTING PROCESS THAT HAS HITHERTO FAILED TO COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION
AND PROMISING TO DO BETTER IN THE MORNING I NATURALLY EXPECT TO BE TAKEN INTO THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF WHICH THE PASHA KHAN ORDERS THE PEOPLE TO SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE CARAVANSERAI ARRIVING AT THE CARAVANSERAI
THE ROAD IS NOT SO FAVORABLE FOR SPURTING AS YESTERDAY AND THE RACING RYOTS GRAB ME AMID MUCH BOISTEROUS MERRIMENT ERE I OVERCOME THE OBSTRUCTION
AND THEN BIDS ME ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO HIS RESIDENCE AFTER PERMITTING HIM TO EAT A SUFFICIENCY OF HUMBLE PIE IN THE SHAPE OF COAXING TO ATONE FOR HIS FORMER INCIVILITY
IN FROLICSOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALWAYS HAVING A HOWLING MAJORITY OVER THEIR LESS PROLIFIC NEIGHBORS REFRESHMENTS IN ABUNDANCE ARE TENDERED AND THE USUAL PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS EXCHANGED BETWEEN US
BACALEM YOLE LAZIM BACALEM SABA I REPLY FOR IT IS TOO DARK TO RIDE ON UNKNOWN GROUND THIS EVENING BIN BACALEM REPEATS THE PASHA KHAN EVEN MORE DICTATORIAL THAN BEFORE
RESPECTFULLY SALAAM AND GIVE WAY IT IS THE GREAT PASHA KHAN
THEY ARE ALL COVERED WITH A GROWTH OF MOSS WHILE THE VOLCANIC BED THEY REPOSE ON IS PERFECTLY NAKED BEYOND THIS SINGULAR AREA THE COUNTRY CONTINUES WILD AND MOUNTAINOUS WITH NO HABITATIONS NEAR THE ROAD AND THUS IT CONTINUES UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER NIGHT FALL
OR TO PREVENT A CONFLICT BETWEEN US WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AN UNCERTAINTY I AM AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WITH THE ADVANTAGE ON THEIR SIDE THE KOORDISH HERDSMEN RARELY TROUBLE THEMSELVES
SUCH IS MY FIRST AUTUMN EVENING BENEATH THE CLOUDLESS SKIES OF PERSIA SOON THE VILLAGE OF OVAHJIK IS REACHED AND SOME PEASANTS GUIDE ME TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PASHA KHAN
IN THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEE THEY READILY FALL INTO THE TRAP AND THE NEXT MINUTE SEES ME FLYING DOWN THE ROAD WITH A SWARM OF BARE LEGGED RYOTS IN FULL CHASE AFTER ME YELLING FOR ME TO STOP
HAD THEY ATTACKED ME IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING ELSE TO DEFEND MYSELF WITH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO SHOOT THEM THE NEAREST PERSIAN VILLAGE IS ABOUT TEN MILES DISTANT THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING LIKE CONTINUOUSLY RIDABLE ROAD
POINTS TO ME AND DRAWS HIS FINGER ACROSS HIS THROAT INTIMATING THAT HE WOULD LIKE THE PRIVILEGE OF CUTTING SOMEBODY'S THROAT AND WHY NOT LET HIM CUT MINE
BY HIS PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS I UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH THOUGH AND THE ROAD JUST HERE HAPPENING TO BE EXCELLENT WHEELING TO THE DELIGHT OF THE WHOLE VILLAGE I SPURT AHEAD OUTDISTANCING THE ZAPTIEH'S NOT OVER SPRIGHTLY ANIMAL
I AM PICKING MY WAY THROUGH THIS CULTIVATED FIELD WHICH UPON CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE PROVES TO BE A SMOOTH LAVA BED AND THE CABBAGES ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN BOULDERS OF SINGULAR UNIFORMITY AND WHAT IS EQUALLY CURIOUS
SOME DAY IF SHE DOESN'T BE MORE REASONABLE HER HUSBAND INSTEAD OF SATISFYING HIS OUTRAGED FEELINGS BY CHASTISING HER WITH A HOE HANDLE WILL IN A MOMENT OF PASSION BID HER BEGONE FROM HIS HOUSE WHICH IN TURKISH LAW CONSTITUTES A LEGAL SEPARATION
THE LADY ALIGHTS FROM THE SADDLE AND INTRODUCES HERSELF AS MISSUS E THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE PERSIAN MISSIONARIES HER HUSBAND HAS LATELY RETURNED HOME AND SHE IS ON THE WAY TO JOIN HIM
I LIKEWISE SMILE BUT AFFECT IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE MYSTERIOUS TICKING
AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THE CIRCASSIANS BETRAY MORE INTEREST IN MY PURELY PERSONAL AFFAIRS WHETHER I AM RUSSIAN OR ENGLISH WHITHER I AM BOUND ET CETERA AND LESS INTEREST IN THE BICYCLE THAN EITHER TURKS OR ARMENIANS
DELIVERS ME OVER TO ANOTHER SOLDIER HIMSELF RETURNING BACK THIS IS MY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY AND SOON AFTER LEAVING THE VILLAGE I BID MY VALIANT PROTECTOR RETURN THE MAN SEEMS TOTALLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHY
ENTERS UPON A WORDY DEMURRER
BUT UNFORTUNTAELY THIS IS OLD YAORT YAORT THAT IS IN THE SERE AND YELLOW STAGE OF ITS USEFULNESS AS HUMAN FOOD AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE DOUBTLESS CONSUME IT THUS I PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND LESS ODORIFEROUS TURNS UP
FROM WHICH POINT THERE WOULD BE STEAM COMMUNICATION WITH EUROPE ERE THE POOR LADY GETS TO TREBIZOND SHE WILL BE LIKELY TO REFLECT THAT A GOVERNMENT SO CIVILIZED AS THE CZAR'S MIGHT RELAX ITS GLOOMY LAWS
THEY SEARCH THE ENTIRE VILLAGE FOR EATABLES BUT NOTHING IS READILY OBTAINABLE BUT BREAD A FEW GAUNT ANGULAR FOWLS ARE SCRATCHING ABOUT BUT THEY HAVE A BERUFFLED DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE AS THOUGH THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN A CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE AGAINST BEING CAUGHT AND DEVOURED
FALL ON BIASED EARS AND I PEREMPTORILY ORDER HIM TO DEPART THE TABREEZ TRAIL IS NOW EASILY FOLLOWED WITHOUT A GUIDE AND WITH A SENSE OF PERFECT FREEDOM AND UNRESTRAINT
TO SOMETHING AKIN TO A FREE CIRCUS FOR CROWDS OF BARELEGGED RYOTS I SOON DISCOVER THAT WITH CHARACTERISTIC PERSIAN TRUTHFULNESS HE HAS LIKEWISE BEEN SPREADING THE INTERESTING REPORT
WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH HIS WONDERFUL ARABA WILL BECOME A RED LETTER EVENT IN THE MEMORY OF THE PEOPLE ALONG MY ROUTE THROUGH ASIA MINOR
AND AGAIN IN THE MORNING I WAS WORRIED TO PART WITH IT SO I FINALLY PRESENTED IT TO ONE OF THEM HE HASTILY HID IT AWAY AMONG HIS CLOTHES AND DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH FEARFUL
AND OCCUPY ENTIRELY SEPARATE APARTMENTS WHICH ARE UNAPPROACHABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX SAVE THEIR HUSBANDS THE PASHA KHAN OF OVAHJIK HOWEVER SEEMS TO BE A KIND INDULGENT HUSBAND AND FATHER
ONCE TO DAY I MANAGED TO OUTWIT THEM BEAUTIFULLY PRETENDING ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR PROPOSITION OF WAITING TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR KHAN I PROPOSE MOUNTING AND RIDING A FEW YARDS FOR THEIR OWN EDIFICATION WHILE WAITING
AFTER RIDING FOR THEM I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT SO FAR AS SIGHT SEEING IS CONCERNED THE LADIES LEAVE ME RATHER UNDER OBLIGATIONS THAN OTHERWISE
IS A LONE CIRCASSIAN WATCHDOG HE IS OF A STALWART WARLIKE APPEARANCE AND ALTHOUGH WEARING NO ARMS EXCEPT A CAVALRY SWORD A SHORTER BROAD SWORD A DRAGOON REVOLVER A TWO FOOT HORSE PISTOL AND A DOUBLE BARRELLED SHOT GUN SLUNG AT HIS BACK
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
VANISHES LIKE A DEER IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS COMPANIONS IT IS AN UNENVIABLE SITUATION TO FIND ONE'S SELF IN IF I BOLDLY APPROACH THEM THESE PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO ASCERTAIN MY CHARACTER IN THE MOONLIGHT
AND WELL WORN CAMEL PATHS AFFORD SOME EXCELLENT WHEELING NEAR MID DAY WHILE LABORIOUSLY ASCENDING A LONG BUT NOT ALTOGETHER UNRIDABLE ASCENT I MEET A COUPLE OF MOUNTED SOLDIERS
AN APPEAL TO THE REVOLVER WILL INVARIABLY SECURE MY RELEASE BUT ONE NATURALLY GETS ASHAMED OF THREATENING PEOPLE'S LIVES EVEN UNDER THE EXASPERATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A FORCIBLE DETENTION
TO OPEN THE ENVELOPE HE IS A DULL FACED UNINTELLECTUAL LOOKIUG PERSONAGE AND WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY PALAVER HE SAYS BIN BACALEM IN A DICTATORIAL TONE OF VOICE
AND APPEARS ANXIOUS TO ATONE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LITTLE INCIVILITY OF YESTERDAY EVENING AND TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS I MAY PERCHANCE ENTERTAIN OF HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT BEFORE I LEAVE
REQUESTING ME NEXT MORNING TO RIDE UP AND DOWN THE BRICK PAVED WALK FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS WIVES AND DAUGHTERS IN THE SECLUSION OF THEIR OWN WALLED PREMISES THE PERSIAN FEMALES ARE EVIDENTLY NOT SO PARTICULAR ABOUT CONCEALING THEIR FEATURES
MISTER FULTON SENT A DARKY WITH A MESSAGE TO SYLVIA'S MOTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING THE LITTLE GIRL FOR A SAIL TO THE FORTS AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY WERE ON BOARD THE BUTTERFLY AS SYLVIA HAD NAMED THE WHITE SLOOP AND WERE GOING SWIFTLY DOWN THE HARBOR
TOOK OFF HER PRETTY HAT AND SAID TOO BAD DEAR CHILD BUT YOU DID RIGHT A LITTLE YANKEE GIRL MUST BE LOYAL TO THE STARS AND STRIPES I AM GLAD YOU CAME AND TOLD ME FOR A MOMENT
NOW SYLVIA REALIZED AS SHE STOOD ALONE IN HER SAFE PLEASANT CHAMBER THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE MUST DELIVER THE LETTER ENTRUSTED TO HER IF IT WAS TO GO TO WASHINGTON IT MUST BE SOME MESSAGE THAT WAS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE OFFICERS AT FORT MOULTRIE AND FORT SUMTER SHE THOUGHT
BUT SHE WAS SURE THAT FLORA HAD NOT MEANT TO FRIGHTEN OR REALLY DECEIVE THEM AND SHE WANTED TO DEFEND HER ABSENT FRIEND WELL GRACE WE KNOW FLORA WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING MEAN AND YOU SEE SHE GOT HURT
GRACE GRACE CALLED MISS ROSALIE AND BEFORE SYLVIA COULD RESPOND HER LOYAL PLAYMATE HAD TURNED OBEDIENTLY BACK TO THE HOUSE SYLVIA STEPPED OUT ON THE STREET HER EYES A LITTLE BLURRED BY TEARS
AND THE GOOD NATURED CAPTAIN RESTED A KINDLY HAND ON THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHOULDER AND WALKED DOWN THE WHARF SYLVIA HEARD THE MEN TALKING OF THE CHARLESTON ARSENAL AND OF THE BOXES OF ARMS WHICH WERE TO BE TAKEN ON THE SCHOONER TO FORT SUMTER
THEN I GUESS GRACE WILL BELIEVE THIS IS A HAUNTED HOUSE SAID FLORA A LITTLE TRIUMPHANTLY I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID GRACE AND TRULY I BELIEVE SYLVIA JUST DREAMED IT FLORA SAT UP IN BED SUDDENLY
MISSUS FULTON WAS TOO REJOICED TO HAVE HER LITTLE GIRL SAFELY AT HOME TO QUESTION OR BLAME HER SYLVIA WAS NOT HUNGRY THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF FORT SUMTER HAD GIVEN THE TWO CHILDREN AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
JES KEEP RIGHT CLOSE TO ME SHE WHISPERED AND SYLVIA OBEYED THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS CREPT UP THE CABIN STAIRS AND CROUCHING CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE CABIN MADE THEIR WAY TOWARD THE STERN OF THE VESSEL
BUT GREATLY COMFORTED BY GRACE'S ASSURING WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP SHE DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME AND TELL HER MOTHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOW HER MISS PATTEN'S NOTE
ESTRALLA ESTRALLA AND SURE THAT IF SHE WAS WITHIN HEARING ESTRALLA WOULD INSTANTLY APPEAR AS SYLVIA CLIMBED OVER THE SANDY SLOPE SHE SAW HERE AND THERE A SMALL GREEN VINE WITH GLOSSY LEAVES AND A TINY YELLOW BLOSSOM
TWENTY DOLLARS WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY SHE REFLECTED IF THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS WOULD ONLY COME QUICKLY AND SET THE SLAVES FREE BUT EVEN IF THEY DID NOT COME FOR A LONG TIME THE MONEY WOULD SURELY PAY MISTER WAITE WAGES FOR ESTRALLA SO THAT HE WOULD NOT INSIST ON SELLING HER
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE SCHOONER WAS TOWED OUT INTO THE CHANNEL NOR WHEN THE SAILS WERE HOISTED AND THEY WENT SAILING DOWN THE BAY FOR CAPTAIN CARLETON HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HIS LITTLE GUEST
AND WITH A CHUCKLE OF DELIGHT ESTRALLA CLOSED THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HER SHE HAD BEEN QUITE READY TO RUN AWAY WITH MISSY SYLVIA WHEN SHE HAD CREPT UP THE STAIRS EARLIER IN THE EVENING BUT TO STAY SAFELY WITH HER MAMMY
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT MISTER FULTON EXPLAINED THAT HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS LOST THAT HE MUST BE PERMITTED TO RETURN TO THE FORT THE SENTRY WASTED NO WORDS ORDERS SIR SORRY WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE HE COULD GET
FOR HER MOTHER WAS SITTING ON THE BIG SOFA NEAR THE OPEN FIRE AND BESIDE HER SAT MISTER ROBERT WAITE WHILE HER FATHER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THEM
QUESTIONED ESTRALLA EARNESTLY I THINK I WILL TAKE THE MONEY SYLVIA SAID NOT ANSWERING ESTRALLA'S QUESTION THEN MISTER WAITE WILL BE SURE THAT I CAN PAY HIM
FOR SHE REALIZED THAT THE VESSEL WAS MOVING SWIFTLY THROUGH THE WATER SHE WONDERED WHY CAPTAIN CARLETON HAD GONE AWAY SEEING ESTRALLA THERE GAVE HER A DREADFUL CERTAINTY THAT WHAT THE LITTLE DARKY SAID MIGHT BE TRUE
YES THERE WAS MISSY SYLVIA ON THE BROAD CUSHIONED SEAT UNDER THE WINDOW VERY SOFTLY ESTRALLA TIPTOED ACROSS THE CABIN JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK SYLVIA'S NAME THE SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS STARTLED HER AND
THE SOLDIER HAD A NOTE FOR MISSUS FULTON EXPLAINING THAT SYLVIA APPARENTLY ON HER WAY FROM SCHOOL HAD WANDERED DOWN TO THE LANDING AND OF CAPTAIN CARLETON'S FORGETTING HER PRESENCE IN THE CABIN
SYLVIA WAS EAGER TO TELL HER OF ALL THE GOOD TIMES SHE HAD ENJOYED WITH GRACE AND FLORA AND DECLARED THAT THEY WERE HER TRUE FRIENDS THEN SHE TOLD MISSUS CARLETON ABOUT ESTRALLA
MISS ROSALIE CAME DOWN THE AISLE AND LAID A NOTE ON SYLVIA'S DESK IT WAS VERY BRIEF YOU MAY GO HOME AT RECESS TAKE YOUR BOOKS AND GO QUIETLY WITHOUT A WORD TO ANY OF THE OTHER PUPILS
YAS AND ESTRALLA'S BIG EYES GREW ROUND WITH TERROR BUT I AM A WHITE GIRL ESTRALLA SAID SYLVIA ESTRALLA SHOOK HER HEAD DOLEFULLY YAS MISSY BUT I'SE GWINE TO GIT YOU SAFE HOME
A GOLD MOUNTED EMERY BAG SHAPED LIKE A STRAWBERRY AN EMBROIDERY STILETTO OF IVORY AND A GOLD THIMBLE FLORA LIFTED OUT THE EMBROIDERY FRAME AND PUTTING ON HER THIMBLE TOOK A FEW EXACT DAINTY STITCHES IN THE COLLAR WHAT LOVELY WORK YOU CAN DO FLORA
FOR MISTER FULTON HAD TOLD HER THAT VERY MORNING THAT HE WAS SURE SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD SECEDE FROM THE UNION AND THEN NORTHERN MEN WOULD NO LONGER BE WELCOME IN CHARLESTON THAT MEANT OF COURSE THAT THE FULTONS WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO BOSTON IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
AND THAT SHE HAD ON THE VERY HAT SHE HAS ON IN THE PORTRAIT AND THE SAME BLUE DRESS AND LACE COLLAR YOU KNOW THERE'S A SECRET STAIRWAY IN THIS HOUSE IT LEADS FROM ONE OF THE CLOSETS IN YOUR ROOM DOWN TO A CLOSET IN MY FATHER'S LIBRARY AND OUT OF DOORS AND LADY CAROLINE'S GHOST ALWAYS COMES IN THAT WAY
THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND ONLY A LITTLE WESTERLY BREEZE RUFFLED THE BLUE WATERS OF THE HARBOR NEGROES WERE AT WORK ON THE WHARF LOADING BALES OF COTTON ON A BIG SHIP THEY WERE SINGING AS THEY WORKED
SHE TOOK A STEP OR TWO FORWARD HER EYES STILL FIXED ON SYLVIA AND NOT NOTICING THE LITTLE FOOTSTOOL DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER OVER WHICH SHE STUMBLED WITH A LOUD CRASH BREAKING THE PITCHER AND SENDING THE HOT WATER OVER HER BARE FEET OH MAMMY MAMMY
OH IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT
SYLVIA COULD ROW A SMALL BOAT VERY WELL AND HER FATHER HAD PURCHASED A PRETTY SAILBOAT WHICH HE WAS TEACHING HER TO STEER SHE OFTEN WENT WITH HER FATHER ON TRIPS ABOUT THE HARBOR AND THE LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THESE EXCURSIONS WERE THE MOST DELIGHTFUL OF PLEASURES
I KNOWS JES HOW SLAVES ARE KETCHED YAS'M I DOES MY MAMMY TOLE ME
MISSUS FULTON WAS NOT IN HER ROOM SO SYLVIA WENT DOWN THE STAIRS TO LOOK FOR HER SHE HEARD VOICES IN THE SITTING ROOM AND TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION OH SHE WHISPERED AS SHE STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR
NO SHE SAID YOU SHALL NOT BE SOLD NOW DON'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED WE WILL HAVE A TEA PARTY FOR MOLLY AND POLLY AND YOU SHALL WAIT ON THEM RUN DOWN AND ASK YOUR MOTHER TO GIVE US SOME LITTLE CAKES ESTRALLA WAS OFF IN AN INSTANT AND WHILE SHE WAS AWAY
NONSENSE ESTRALLA SYLVIA COULD NOT BE LOST IN MISS PATTEN'S GARDEN SAID MISSUS FULTON BUT SHE DECIDED TO RETURN TO THE SCHOOL WITH THE MAID AS THEY WENT DOWN THE STREET
SYLVIA AND GRACE DECLARED MOLLY AND POLLY HAD SAID
AND WHAT DID GRACE WAITE MEAN ABOUT ANYBODY TAKING FORT SUMTER OR FORT MOULTRIE
WITH FOUR TALL HIGH POSTS THE BED WAS SO HIGH THAT THERE WAS A CUSHIONED STEP BESIDE IT
IT'S A GOOD THING MY ESTRALLA DIDN'T DO THAT I'D A CUFFED HER WELL I SU'LY WOULD SYLVIA DID NOT THINK TO TELL HER MOTHER ABOUT THE GIFT OF THE PINK DRESS TO ESTRALLA SHE DID NOT FEEL QUITE HAPPY THAT SHE HAD NOT EXPLAINED THE BROKEN PITCHER TO HER MOTHER
AND SYLVIA TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING I AM NOT SURPRISED SAID CAPTAIN CARLETON
AND NOW SHE THOUGHT HER SILLY TO BE SO FRIGHTENED I TELLS YOU MISSY I SU'LY WILL BE WHIPPED SHE REPEATED SO EARNESTLY THAT SYLVIA BEGAN TO BELIEVE IT AN WHEN MY MAMMY SEES MY DRESS ALL WET AND ESTRALLA BEGAN TO SOB
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO LITTLE DARKY GIRLS WHEN WILL MISTER LINCOLN BE PRESIDENT SYLVIA ASKED A FEW MORNINGS AFTER HER FATHER'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO BOSTON HE WAS INAUGURATED YESTERDAY REPLIED HER MOTHER
SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY I THINK MISTER ROBERT WAITE IS JUST LIKE THE KNIGHTS IN THAT BOOK THE AGE OF CHIVALRY THEY ALWAYS DID EXACTLY WHAT WAS RIGHT
YOU COULD BEGIN TO MORROW IF YOU WISHED
WHEN SYLVIA SAID THAT HER NAME WAS SYLVIA FULTON AND THAT SHE HAD COME TO SEE CAPTAIN CARLETON A SENTRY EXCLAIMED
AND WHAT REASON COULD SHE GIVE FOR CREEPING OUT OF THE HOUSE AT THAT HOUR BUT SHE REACHED THE LOWER FLOOR SAFELY AND NOW CAME THE DANGER OF MAKING A NOISE WHEN OPENING THE DOOR SYLVIA GRASPED THE BIG KEY AND TURNED IT SLOWLY
THE LITTLE YANKEE AS SHE CALLED SYLVIA EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS HAD RUN HOME TO TELL HER MOTHER OF THE TROUBLE BY THE TIME MISS PATTEN'S MESSENGER HAD REACHED THE FULTON HOUSE SYLVIA WAS IN THE CABIN OF THE LITTLE SCHOONER
I HEARS A GOOD DEAL MISSY DEED I DOES HE DECLARED BUT I DOAN LET ON AS I HEARS MASSA LINKUM HE'S GWINE TO SEND A LOT O BIG SHIPS DOWN HERE FORE LONG YAS INDEED I WISH I COULD HAVE A SAIL IN THE BUTTERFLY AGAIN SAID SYLVIA A LITTLE WISTFULLY
MISSUS FULTON WAS ON THE PIAZZA AND MISSUS WAITE AND GRACE WERE WITH HER GRACE WAS THE FIRST TO SEE AND RECOGNIZE SYLVIA AND WITH A CRY OF DELIGHT RAN TO WELCOME HER
AND THEN LED THE WAY ACROSS THE WIDE HALL AND RAPPED AT A DOOR A LITTLE WHITE MISSY TO SEE YOU MASSA ROBERT HE SAID AND IN A MOMENT SYLVIA FOUND HERSELF STANDING BEFORE A SMILING GENTLEMAN
TOLD BY THE OLDER COLORED PEOPLE OF LITTLE CHILDREN YES AND GROWN PEOPLE TOO WHO HAD BEEN ENTICED ON BOARD VESSELS IN FAR OFF AFRICAN PORTS AND CARRIED OFF TO BE SOLD INTO SLAVERY ESTRALLA REMEMBERED THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN THE STORIES WERE BLACK
AFTER BREAKFAST MAMMY CAME TO TELL THE VISITORS THAT FLORA WAS READY TO SEE THEM BUT JUS FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE ADDED AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF FLORA'S CHAMBER
SHE SAW A FLUTTERING BLUE RIBBON DAT'S OFF'N MISSY SYLVIA'S HAIR DAT RIBBON IS SHE WHISPERED REACHING UP FOR IT HOLDING IT FAST IN HER HANDS SHE LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE MASS OF HEAVY VINES AND NODDED HER LITTLE WOOLLY HEAD
SHE MEANS SHE WILL TELL MISS ROSALIE SAID ONE OF THE GIRLS I DON'T EITHER I CAN LOOK AFTER MY OWN AFFFAIRS RETORTED SYLVIA BRAVELY I'M NOT A TELL TALE
THEN SHE STOPPED SHORT MEN WERE LOADING BOXES ON A SCHOONER AT THE END OF THE PIER AND SHE COULD SEE A TALL OFFICER IN UNIFORM STANDING ON THE DECK OF THE VESSEL HULLO HERE'S ANOTHER SMALL GIRL
AND GAVE GRACE A NOTE FOR MISS PATTEN I'LL WALK TO FLORA'S WITH YOU SAID GRACE NOW SYLVIA OWN UP THAT YOU THINK CHARLESTON IS NICER THAN BOSTON
DURING THE SUMMER WORKMEN HAD BEEN MAKING NECESSARY REPAIRS ON THE FORTIFICATIONS BUT VISITORS WERE ALWAYS WELCOMED BY THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE ONE OF WHOM CAPTAIN CARLETON WAS A COLLEGE FRIEND OF SYLVIA'S FATHER
SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID NOR DID SHE RESIST WE OUGHT TO MAKE HER TAKE IT BACK SAID MAY BAILEY AS ELINOR STOPPED AND THEY ALL STOOD IN A CLOSE GROUP ABOUT SYLVIA
DOANE YES COME IN
WITHIN THE HOUR OF THEIR ARRIVAL SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA WERE ON THEIR WAY HOME THE CAPTAIN HAD PRAISED AND THANKED SYLVIA FOR THE LOYAL FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD PROMPTED HER VISIT MISSUS CARLETON AND I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR COURAGE HE SAID AS HE HANDED HER THE LETTER
SYLVIA SYLVIA SOUNDED HER MOTHER'S VOICE AND BOTH THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH STARTLED EYES RUN SAID SYLVIA GIVING ESTRALLA A LITTLE PUSH RUN OUT ON THE BALCONY
WELL PUT ON YOUR THINGS AND RUN AFTER THEM THAT'S A GOOD GIRL SAID MISTER FULTON WHY HERE IS ESTRALLA NOW HE ADDED AS THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL APPEARED AT THE DOOR TELL MISS SYLVIA TO COME DOWN TO THE LANDING I'LL MEET YOU THERE
FOR VERY FEW SLAVE OWNERS ALLOWED ANYONE TO TEACH THE SLAVES TO READ AND WRITE ESTRALLA KNEW THIS AND IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING THAT MISSY SYLVIA PROPOSED I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT TO MORROW MORNING SAID SYLVIA NOW RUN AWAY
SHE REACHED THE TOP JUST AS SHE HEARD MISS ROSALIE'S SERVANT CALLING HER NAME SYLVIA LOOKED DOWN TO THE FURTHER SIDE THE VINES DROOPED OVER AND BELOW THE WALL A HIGH BANK OF SAND SLOPED TO THE SHORE HOLDING TIGHT TO THE VINES SHE SLID DOWN
BUT SHE HAD PROMISED ESTRALLA THAT SHE WOULD NOT TELL AND SYLVIA KNEW THAT A PROMISE WAS A VERY SERIOUS THING SOMETHING NOT TO BE EASILY FORGOTTEN SHE DID NOT SEE ESTRALLA AGAIN THAT DAY
ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHURCHES OF CHARLESTON AND EVERYWHERE FLUTTERED THE PALMETTO FLAG SYLVIA SAT IN THE STERN BESIDE HER FATHER AND VERY SOON THE TILLER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE WAS SHAPING THE BOAT'S COURSE TOWARD THE FORTS
AND THE TWO GIRLS TURNED DOWN THE STREET LEADING TO THE HOUSE OF ESTRALLA'S MASTER SYLVIA WENT UP THE FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS WHICH LED TO MISTER WAITE'S DOOR A LITTLE FEARFULLY A TALL GOOD NATURED COLORED MAN OPENED THE DOOR AND ASKED HER ERRAND
WHEN I GROW UP ASKED SYLVIA MISSUS FULTON SMILED SYLVIA GROWN UP SEEMED A LONG WAY IN THE FUTURE
I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO RISE AND SALUTE THIS FLAG THE LITTLE GIRLS ALL STOOD AND EACH RAISED HER RIGHT HAND ALL BUT SYLVIA FLUSHED AND UNHAPPY WITH DOWNCAST EYES SHE KEPT HER SEAT
H'AR'S DE HOT WATER AND ESTRALLA HURRIED OFF TO HELP SYLVIA SCRUB OFF THE STICKY SOOT WHICH HAD SO WELL DISGUISED HER AND WHEN MISSUS FULTON AND MISSUS CARLETON RETURNED THEY FOUND A VERY ROSY FACED SMILING LITTLE GIRL ON THE PORCH ALL READY TO TELL THEM OF HER TRIP TO FORT SUMTER
CAN'T AUNT CONNIE AND ESTRALLA GO WITH US AND SYLVIA LIFTED HER HEAD AND LOOKED HOPEFULLY AT HER FATHER COULDN'T I BUY ESTRALLA AND THEN MAKE HER FREE I'VE GOT THAT GOLD MONEY GRANDMA GAVE ME
SHE MIGHT AS WELL LEARN THAT SOUTH CAROLINIANS WILL NOT BE INSULTED AND ELINOR LIFTED HER HEAD PROUDLY I WON'T TAKE IT BACK RETORTED SYLVIA AND YOU ARE THE ONES WHO WILL HAVE TO APOLOGIZE YES
SUDDENLY SHE DECIDED TO GO TO HER FATHER'S WAREHOUSE AND TELL HIM AND GO HOME WITH HIM AT NOON SHE WAS SURE HER FATHER WOULD THINK SHE HAD DONE RIGHT SHE TURNED AND WALKED QUICKLY DOWN KING STREET
BOTH GRACE AND FLORA ADVISED SYLVIA NOT TO TELL HER MOTHER OF ELINOR'S UNKINDNESS OR OF HER TAUNTING WORDS
WHY I HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HER RESPONDED MISTER FULTON SHE RAN OFF AS SOON AS SYLVIA WAS MISSED GRACE CONTINUED EARNESTLY AND SHE WILL FIND HER PROBABLY SHE HAS FOUND HER BEFORE THIS
I'LL GET WHIPPED YAS'M I WILL FER BREAKING THE PITCHER YOU WON'T DECLARED SYLVIA HALF ANGRILY IT'S MY MOTHER'S PITCHER AND I'LL TELL HER YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK IT NOW YOU GO AND PUT ON ANOTHER DRESS AND TELL JENNIE TO COME UP HERE AND WIPE UP THIS FLOOR
A CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVERY NOOK AND CORNER OF FORT MOULTRIE WAS SEARCHED FOR THE MISSING SYLVIA AND WHEN NO TRACE OF HER COULD BE DISCOVERED
I AM SO GLAD I THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS REALLY ESTRALLA SHE SAID IF I WAS BLACK WE COULD COME SYLVIA HAD REPLIED THEN THE BOAT SWUNG CLEAR AND HEADED TOWARD CHARLESTON I AM NOT GOING TO LAND AT THE BIG WHARVES SAID SYLVIA I AM GOING TO THAT WHARF NEAR MISS PATTEN'S GARDEN
PERHAPS THE VESSEL MIGHT HAVE OTHERS ON BOARD WHO WERE BEING TAKEN OFF TO BE SOLD AS ESTRALLA DECLARED YAS MISSY MY MAMMY'S TOLE ME JES HOW WHITE FOLKS GETS BLACK FOLKS FER SLAVES
GRACE LOOKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR NOT SEEING A LITTLE FIGURE CROUCHING IN A SHADOWY CORNER I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HEAR IT'S ABOUT THE GHOST SHE WHISPERED I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
HE SAID THAT RALPH WAS IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY I'D BE A SOLDIER IF I WAS ONLY A LITTLE OLDER HE DECLARED AND SYLVIA DID NOT EVEN ASK HIM ABOUT DINKIE OR THE PONIES SHE WISHED THAT SHE COULD TELL HIM THAT VERY SOON SHE WAS GOING TO BOSTON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST NOT
WITH A ROUND WOOLLY HEAD AND BIG STARTLED EYES STOOD PEERING IN SHE WAS BAREFOOTED AND WORE A STRAIGHT GARMENT OF FADED BLUE COTTON FOR A MOMENT THE TWO CHILDREN STARED AT EACH OTHER
SHE WAS ALWAYS QUITE READY TO SMILE BUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SYLVIA HAD WANTED HER TO COME SO MYSTERIOUSLY TO HER ROOM AND I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO READ AND WRITE SYLVIA ADDED IS YOU MISSY
HER MAMMY WAS BUSY PREPARING BREAKFAST WHEN ESTRALLA SLID QUIETLY INTO THE KITCHEN WHEN SHE DID LOOK AROUND AND SAW THE CHILD WEARING THE PINK DRESS SHE NEARLY DROPPED THE DISH OF HOT BACON WHICH JENNIE WAS WAITING TO TAKE TO THE DINING ROOM
OH IT MEANS THAT YOU BELIEVE SOUTH CAROLINA HAS A RIGHT TO KEEP ITS SLAVES AND SELL THEM OF COURSE
AND NOW FOUND HERSELF NEAR THE LANDING PLACE SO THAT WHEN MISSUS CARLETON MADE THE GIRLS A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND LOOKED ABOUT TO GIVE ESTRALLA HER SHARE THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL WAS NOT TO BE SEEN I'LL CALL HER SAID SYLVIA AND RAN OUT ON THE VERANDA
THEY SAY SLAVERY ISN'T RIGHT THERE WAS A LITTLE MURMUR OF LAUGHTER AMONG THE OTHER GIRLS FOR IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA BELIEVED THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT IN BUYING NEGROES FOR SLAVES AND IN SELLING THEM WHEN THEY DESIRED
ESTRALLA DID NOT QUESTION THE COMMAND AND IN A MOMENT CARRYING DRESS AND TOWEL
I THANK YOU HE SAID LOOKING WITH SMILING EYES AT THE TIRED LITTLE FIGURE IN THE BROWN CAPE THEN HE ASKED SYLVIA HER NAME AND SHE TOLD HIM THAT NO ONE NOT EVEN HER DEAR MOTHER KNEW THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MESSAGE
BUT I COULD GO SLEIGHING RESPONDED SYLVIA AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF FLORA'S HOME THEY BOTH EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE WHY THEY ARE ALL GOING AWAY
AND THIS THOUGH NOT LOGICALLY REFUTABLE IS A THEORY TO BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE THUS IT IS EASIER TO ACCOUNT FOR FALSEHOOD IF WE TAKE JUDGEMENT TO BE A RELATION IN WHICH THE MIND AND THE VARIOUS OBJECTS CONCERNED ALL OCCUR SEVERALLY
THEN FORGETTING THAT THIS WAS ONLY TRUE WHEN IDEAS WERE TAKEN AS ACTS OF APPREHENSION WE TRANSFER THE PROPOSITION THAT IDEAS ARE IN THE MIND TO IDEAS IN THE OTHER SENSE
INDUCTION IS ALWAYS THEORETICALLY PREFERABLE AND WARRANTS A GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH OF OUR CONCLUSION BECAUSE ALL EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS ARE MORE UNCERTAIN THAN THE INSTANCES OF THEM WE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT THERE ARE PROPOSITIONS KNOWN A PRIORI
MY ACQUAINTANCE GIVES ME THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT EXISTS BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT CONVERSELY WHENEVER I CAN KNOW THAT A THING OF A CERTAIN SORT EXISTS I OR SOME ONE ELSE MUST BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE THING
THE QUESTION WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK IS WHEN TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE OFTEN ASSOCIATED
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MAY BE IS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED INSTEAD OF BEING SHUT IN WITHIN NARROW WALLS OF WHICH EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY COULD BE EXPLORED WE FIND OURSELVES IN AN OPEN WORLD OF FREE POSSIBILITIES
WHEN OTHELLO BELIEVES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO HE MUST NOT HAVE BEFORE HIS MIND A SINGLE OBJECT DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO OR THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO FOR THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THERE SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE FALSEHOODS WHICH SUBSIST INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY MINDS
WITH A GREATER APPROACH TO CERTAINTY IF WE MAKE OUR ARGUMENT PURELY INDUCTIVE THAN IF WE GO BY WAY OF ALL MEN ARE MORTAL AND THEN USE DEDUCTION THIS ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERAL PROPOSITIONS KNOWN A PRIORI SUCH AS TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR
THERE IS A CONFUSION ENGENDERED BY THE USE OF THE WORD IDEA WE THINK OF AN IDEA AS ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING IN SOMEBODY'S MIND AND THUS WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT A TREE CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF IDEAS IT IS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT IF SO
THAN VARIOUS OTHER SIMILAR PRINCIPLES FOR INSTANCE THE ONE WE CONSIDERED JUST NOW WHICH STATES THAT WHAT FOLLOWS FROM A TRUE PREMISS IS TRUE THE NAME LAWS OF THOUGHT IS ALSO MISLEADING
TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ANY OPPOSITE TWO IT SEEMS FAIRLY EVIDENT THAT IF THERE WERE NO BELIEFS THERE COULD BE NO FALSEHOOD AND NO TRUTH EITHER IN THE SENSE IN WHICH TRUTH IS CORRELATIVE TO FALSEHOOD IF WE IMAGINE A WORLD OF MERE MATTER THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM FOR FALSEHOOD IN SUCH A WORLD
WHICH THE DISPUTANTS SHARE FROM BLANK DOUBT NO ARGUMENT CAN BEGIN HENCE THE CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH PHILOSOPHY EMPLOYS MUST NOT BE OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE KIND IF ANY RESULT IS TO BE ACHIEVED
ASSUMING THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS HELD IN THE PAST TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY WILL HOLD IN THE FUTURE IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT WE HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THE FUTURE WILL RESEMBLE THE PAST BECAUSE WHAT WAS THE FUTURE HAS CONSTANTLY BECOME THE PAST AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOUND TO RESEMBLE THE PAST
THE GROUNDS ON WHICH IDEALISM IS ADVOCATED ARE GENERALLY GROUNDS DERIVED FROM THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IS TO SAY FROM A DISCUSSION OF THE CONDITIONS WHICH THINGS MUST SATISFY IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO KNOW THEM
THUS BUT FOR THE OBJECTS WHICH HE KNOWS OR LOVES OR HATES HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE IS HE IS ESSENTIALLY AND OBVIOUSLY A FRAGMENT TAKEN AS THE SUM TOTAL OF REALITY HE WOULD BE SELF CONTRADICTORY
AND SUCH AND SUCH OTHERS CANNOT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF SURVIVING A CRITICAL SCRUTINY IN THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL BRIEFLY CONSIDER THE KIND OF WAY IN WHICH SUCH REASONING IS ATTEMPTED WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING WHETHER WE CAN HOPE THAT IT MAY BE VALID
WHEN SWIFT INVITES US TO CONSIDER THE RACE OF STRULDBUGS WHO NEVER DIE WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIESCE IN IMAGINATION BUT A WORLD WHERE TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE SEEMS QUITE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE FEEL THAT SUCH A WORLD IF THERE WERE ONE WOULD UPSET THE WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR KNOWLEDGE
BECAUSE IT HAS RISEN IN THE PAST IF WE ARE CHALLENGED AS TO WHY WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AS HERETOFORE WE MAY APPEAL TO THE LAWS OF MOTION THE EARTH WE SHALL SAY IS A FREELY ROTATING BODY
IT WOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY TRUTHS IN THE SENSE IN WHICH TRUTHS ARE THINGS OF THE SAME KIND AS FALSEHOODS IN FACT TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD ARE PROPERTIES OF BELIEFS AND STATEMENTS HENCE A WORLD OF MERE MATTER SINCE IT WOULD CONTAIN NO BELIEFS OR STATEMENTS WOULD ALSO CONTAIN
SOME KNOWLEDGE SUCH AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SENSE DATA APPEARS QUITE INDUBITABLE HOWEVER CALMLY AND THOROUGHLY WE REFLECT UPON IT IN REGARD TO SUCH KNOWLEDGE PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISM DOES NOT REQUIRE
HENCE ONE ACQUAINTANCE WITH A THING DOES NOT LOGICALLY INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS RELATIONS AND TWO A KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF ITS RELATIONS DOES NOT INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OF ITS RELATIONS NOR A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE IN THE ABOVE SENSE
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A BELIEF IS FALSE THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY COMPOSED ONLY OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF IF OTHELLO BELIEVES FALSELY THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO THEN THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY AS DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO
WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAS NO INCOMPLETENESS NO OPPOSITE AND NO NEED OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT THE ABSOLUTE IDEA THEREFORE IS ADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE ABSOLUTE REALITY BUT ALL LOWER IDEAS ONLY DESCRIBE REALITY
WE ARE ALL CONVINCED THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW WHY
OF THE WHOLE OF OUR EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE FUTURE THE WHOLE OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY INDUCTION AND IN FACT PRACTICALLY ALL THE BELIEFS UPON WHICH OUR DAILY LIFE IS BASED IT MUST BE CONCEDED TO BEGIN WITH
FOR SUCH JUDGEMENTS DO REQUIRE EMPIRICAL PREMISSES I AM SPEAKING OF JUDGEMENTS AS TO THE INTRINSIC DESIRABILITY OF THINGS IF SOMETHING IS USEFUL IT MUST BE USEFUL BECAUSE IT SECURES SOME END THE END MUST IF WE HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH BE VALUABLE ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT
THE MORE PROBABLE IT BECOMES THAT THEY WILL BE FOUND TOGETHER ANOTHER TIME AND THAT IF THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND TOGETHER OFTEN ENOUGH THE PROBABILITY WILL AMOUNT ALMOST TO CERTAINTY IT CAN NEVER QUITE REACH CERTAINTY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN SPITE OF FREQUENT REPETITIONS
NO REASON FOR REJECTING THEM HAS APPEARED IF AS MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE SCIENCES WERE CAPABLE WHEN DISENGAGED FROM IRRELEVANT DETAIL
IT IS JUST AS NECESSARY THAT OUR PRINCIPLES OF INFERENCE SHOULD BE TRUE AS IT IS THAT OUR DATA SHOULD BE TRUE THE PRINCIPLES OF INFERENCE ARE APT TO BE OVERLOOKED BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY OBVIOUSNESS THE ASSUMPTION INVOLVED IS ASSENTED TO WITHOUT OUR REALIZING THAT IT IS AN ASSUMPTION
WHICH WE EXPECT IF WE TOUCH THEM ONE OF THE HORRORS OF A GHOST IN MANY GHOST STORIES IS THAT IT FAILS TO GIVE US ANY SENSATIONS OF TOUCH UNEDUCATED PEOPLE WHO GO ABROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE WORD APPLIES TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WHICH WE MAY CALL ACQUAINTANCE THIS IS THE SENSE IN WHICH WE KNOW SENSE DATA THE DISTINCTION INVOLVED IS ROUGHLY THAT BETWEEN SAVOIR
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT PROBABILITY IS ALWAYS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN DATA IN OUR CASE THE DATA ARE MERELY THE KNOWN CASES OF COEXISTENCE OF A AND B THERE MAY BE OTHER DATA WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD GRAVELY ALTER THE PROBABILITY
THIS WHOLE POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER TURNS UPON THE NOTION OF THE NATURE OF A THING
WHEN HOWEVER WE SPEAK OF PHILOSOPHY AS A CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPOSE A CERTAIN LIMITATION IF WE ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMPLETE SCEPTIC PLACING OURSELVES WHOLLY OUTSIDE ALL KNOWLEDGE
IT MUST BE ADMITTED FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED THAT LOGICAL PRINCIPLES ARE KNOWN TO US AND CANNOT BE THEMSELVES PROVED BY EXPERIENCE SINCE ALL PROOF PRESUPPOSES THEM IN THIS THEREFORE WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF THE CONTROVERSY THE RATIONALISTS WERE IN THE RIGHT
THAN THE PROBABILITY THAT ALL MEN ARE MORTAL THIS IS OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF ALL MEN ARE MORTAL SO IS SOCRATES BUT IF SOCRATES IS MORTAL IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT ALL MEN ARE MORTAL HENCE WE SHALL REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT SOCRATES IS MORTAL
WHICH GRAPPLE IT TO THE NEXT PIECE THE NEXT PIECE IN TURN HAS FRESH HOOKS AND SO ON UNTIL THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS RECONSTRUCTED THIS ESSENTIAL INCOMPLETENESS APPEARS ACCORDING TO HEGEL EQUALLY IN THE WORLD OF THOUGHT AND IN THE WORLD OF THINGS
SIMILARLY JEALOUSY REQUIRES THREE PEOPLE THERE CAN BE NO SUCH RELATION THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THREE AT LEAST
THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE SUCH AS THE BELIEF IN THE REIGN OF LAW AND THE BELIEF THAT EVERY EVENT MUST HAVE A CAUSE ARE AS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT UPON THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE AS ARE THE BELIEFS OF DAILY LIFE
WHAT DO WE MEAN BY TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD IT IS THIS PRELIMINARY QUESTION WHICH IS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THIS CHAPTER IN THIS CHAPTER WE ARE NOT ASKING HOW WE CAN KNOW WHETHER A BELIEF IS TRUE OR FALSE WE ARE ASKING WHAT IS MEANT BY THE QUESTION WHETHER A BELIEF IS TRUE OR FALSE
THUS THE SCOPE AND POWER OF A PRIORI PRINCIPLES IS STRICTLY LIMITED ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING EXISTS MUST BE IN PART DEPENDENT ON EXPERIENCE WHEN ANYTHING IS KNOWN IMMEDIATELY ITS EXISTENCE IS KNOWN BY EXPERIENCE ALONE WHEN ANYTHING IS PROVED TO EXIST WITHOUT BEING KNOWN IMMEDIATELY
WHEN A THING OF A CERTAIN SORT A HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A THING OF A CERTAIN OTHER SORT B AND HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND DISSOCIATED FROM A THING OF THE SORT B THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH A AND B HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED
THEY MAY BE ELICITED BY EXPERIENCE AND INDEED THEY MUST BE
AND PAST SENSE DATA WHICH ARE REMEMBERED ARE KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED IN THE PAST THIS KNOWLEDGE SUPPLIES OUR DATA BUT IF WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM THESE DATA
SO FAR AS THINGS ARE CONCERNED WE MAY KNOW THEM OR NOT KNOW THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSITIVE STATE OF MIND WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ERRONEOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS SO LONG AT ANY RATE AS WE CONFINE OURSELVES TO KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE WHATEVER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MUST BE SOMETHING
BUT ALTHOUGH SUCH A VIEW DOES NOT SEEM INCONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACTS THERE IS NO REASON TO PREFER IT TO THE COMMON SENSE VIEW ACCORDING TO WHICH OTHER PEOPLE AND THINGS DO REALLY EXIST THUS COHERENCE AS THE DEFINITION OF TRUTH FAILS BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE COHERENT SYSTEM
IF SOCRATES IS NOT ONE OF THE MEN ON WHOM OUR INDUCTION IS BASED WE SHALL STILL DO BETTER TO ARGUE STRAIGHT FROM OUR A B C TO SOCRATES THAN TO GO ROUND BY THE GENERAL PROPOSITION ALL MEN ARE MORTAL FOR THE PROBABILITY THAT SOCRATES IS MORTAL IS GREATER ON OUR DATA
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HIS ARGUMENT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND HIS USE OF THE WORD IDEA HE GIVES THE NAME IDEA TO ANYTHING WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY KNOWN AS FOR EXAMPLE SENSE DATA ARE KNOWN
AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH PRINCIPLES PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE WHICH WE CONSIDERED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER ONE OF THE GREAT HISTORIC CONTROVERSIES IN PHILOSOPHY IS THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE TWO SCHOOLS CALLED RESPECTIVELY EMPIRICISTS AND RATIONALISTS
IN THIS BELIEF THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE A PRIORI CONCERNING EXISTENCE SEEMS TO BE HYPOTHETICAL IT TELLS US THAT IF ONE THING EXISTS ANOTHER MUST EXIST OR MORE GENERALLY THAT IF ONE PROPOSITION IS TRUE ANOTHER MUST BE TRUE
AND THAT SOMETIMES ON THE BASIS OF OBSERVATION WE CAN SEE THAT ONLY ONE LAW CAN POSSIBLY FIT THE FACTS OF THE CASE NOW TO THIS VIEW THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS THE FIRST IS THAT EVEN IF SOME LAW WHICH HAS NO EXCEPTIONS APPLIES TO OUR CASE WE CAN NEVER
SUCH AS THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION THUS OUR INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR OTHER KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS IS OF TWO SORTS
AND THAT IT IS THE ESSENCE OF A TRUTH TO FORM PART OF THE COMPLETELY ROUNDED SYSTEM WHICH IS THE TRUTH THERE IS HOWEVER A GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THIS VIEW OR RATHER TWO GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ONLY ONE COHERENT BODY OF BELIEFS IS POSSIBLE
THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF SPACE AND TIME HAS HAPPENED TO SOME EXTENT IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS WELL
A MIND WHICH BELIEVES BELIEVES TRULY WHEN THERE IS A CORRESPONDING COMPLEX NOT INVOLVING THE MIND BUT ONLY ITS OBJECTS THIS CORRESPONDENCE ENSURES TRUTH AND ITS ABSENCE ENTAILS FALSEHOOD
IF NOT IT BECOMES PLAIN THAT WE HAVE NO GROUND WHATEVER FOR EXPECTING THE SUN TO RISE TO MORROW OR FOR EXPECTING THE BREAD WE SHALL EAT AT OUR NEXT MEAL NOT TO POISON US OR FOR ANY OF THE OTHER SCARCELY CONSCIOUS EXPECTATIONS THAT CONTROL OUR DAILY LIVES
KANT WHO FIRST EMPHASIZED THIS CONTRADICTION DEDUCED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SPACE AND TIME WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE MERELY SUBJECTIVE AND SINCE HIS TIME VERY MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THAT SPACE AND TIME
CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED BY THIS TEST FOR THE ABOVE TWO REASONS COHERENCE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GIVING THE MEANING OF TRUTH THOUGH IT IS OFTEN A MOST IMPORTANT TEST OF TRUTH AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRUTH HAS BECOME KNOWN
IF MATTER WERE ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING WITH WHICH WE COULD NOT BECOME ACQUAINTED MATTER WOULD BE SOMETHING WHICH WE COULD NOT KNOW TO EXIST AND WHICH COULD HAVE FOR US NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER IT IS GENERALLY ALSO IMPLIED FOR REASONS WHICH REMAIN OBSCURE
EXPERIENCE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY CONFIRM THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE AS REGARDS THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY EXAMINED BUT AS REGARDS UNEXAMINED CASES IT IS THE INDUCTIVE PRINCIPLE ALONE THAT CAN JUSTIFY ANY INFERENCE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN EXAMINED TO WHAT HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED
THAT IS TO SAY DESDEMONA AND LOVING AND CASSIO MUST ALL BE TERMS IN THE RELATION WHICH SUBSISTS WHEN OTHELLO BELIEVES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO
WHAT HAPPENS IN CASES WHERE I HAVE TRUE JUDGEMENT WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE IS THAT THE THING IS KNOWN TO ME BY DESCRIPTION AND THAT IN VIRTUE OF SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLE THE EXISTENCE OF A THING ANSWERING TO THIS DESCRIPTION CAN BE INFERRED
WITH THIS ASPECT WE SPOKE OF THE RELATION CALLED JUDGING OR BELIEVING AS KNITTING TOGETHER INTO ONE COMPLEX WHOLE THE SUBJECT AND THE OBJECTS IN THIS RESPECT JUDGING IS EXACTLY LIKE EVERY OTHER RELATION WHENEVER A RELATION HOLDS BETWEEN TWO OR MORE TERMS
THE EMPIRICISTS WHO ARE BEST REPRESENTED BY THE BRITISH PHILOSOPHERS LOCKE BERKELEY AND HUME MAINTAINED THAT ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE IS DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCE THE RATIONALISTS WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THE CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
WITH NOT EVEN EMPTY TIME BEYOND IT THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITE IN EXTENT AGAIN IF WE TAKE ANY TWO POINTS ON A LINE IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER POINTS BETWEEN THEM HOWEVER SMALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM MAY BE
BUT MERELY SO DIRECTS OUR ATTENTION THAT WE SEE ITS TRUTH WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY PROOF FROM EXPERIENCE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN WHICH THE EMPIRICISTS WERE IN THE RIGHT AS AGAINST THE RATIONALISTS NOTHING CAN BE KNOWN TO EXIST EXCEPT BY THE HELP OF EXPERIENCE
EVERYTHING REAL IS OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO US SINCE AS PERSONS DESIROUS OF KNOWING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UNIVERSE WE HAVE SOME INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS BUT IF THIS SORT OF INTEREST IS INCLUDED
THE REAL TREE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO WHAT WE CALLED THE PHYSICAL OBJECT CONSISTS OF IDEAS IN THE MIND OF GOD IDEAS MORE OR LESS LIKE THOSE WE HAVE WHEN WE SEE THE TREE
RATHER THAN OF TWO COINS OR TWO BOOKS OR TWO PEOPLE OR TWO OF ANY OTHER SPECIFIED KIND BUT AS SOON AS WE ARE ABLE TO DIVEST OUR THOUGHTS OF IRRELEVANT PARTICULARITY
TO THE PHYSICAL OBJECT IN OUR CASE THE TABLE THAT IS TO SAY THEY PROVED THAT A CERTAIN COLOUR WILL EXIST IN A CERTAIN LIGHT IF A NORMAL EYE IS PLACED AT A CERTAIN POINT RELATIVELY TO THE TABLE
TO WHAT ARE CALLED JUDGEMENTS IN THIS SENSE OF THE WORD WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS THE CASE THIS SORT OF KNOWLEDGE MAY BE DESCRIBED AS KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS TWO IN THE SECOND USE OF THE WORD KNOW ABOVE
IF HOWEVER THIS WERE THE SOURCE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR WE SHOULD PROCEED DIFFERENTLY IN PERSUADING OURSELVES OF ITS TRUTH FROM THE WAY IN WHICH WE DO ACTUALLY PROCEED IN FACT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INSTANCES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE US THINK OF TWO ABSTRACTLY
THIS HOPE I BELIEVE IS VAIN IT WOULD SEEM THAT KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED BY METAPHYSICS AND THAT THE PROPOSED PROOFS THAT IN VIRTUE OF THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUCH AND SUCH THINGS MUST EXIST
AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE THE PROPOSITIONS OF LOGIC AND PURE MATHEMATICS AS WELL AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS OF ETHICS THE QUESTION WHICH MUST NEXT OCCUPY US IS THIS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH KNOWLEDGE AND MORE PARTICULARLY
THAT MUST NOW CONCERN US TAKING THE WORD IDEA IN BERKELEY'S SENSE THERE ARE TWO QUITE DISTINCT THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED WHENEVER AN IDEA IS BEFORE THE MIND THERE IS ON THE ONE HAND THE THING OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE
AND ONE OF THE GREAT SOURCES OF METAPHYSICAL CONSTRUCTIONS IS DRIED UP THE MATHEMATICIANS HOWEVER HAVE NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH SHOWING THAT SPACE AS IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO BE IS POSSIBLE
SINCE WHATEVER IS KNOWN IS NECESSARILY AN IDEA THERE ARE IN THIS ARGUMENT A GOOD MANY FALLACIES WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND WHICH IT WILL BE AS WELL TO BRING TO LIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE
THIS IS BY NO MEANS A TRUISM BUT ON THE CONTRARY A PALPABLE FALSEHOOD I HAVE NOT THE HONOUR TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMPEROR OF CHINA BUT I TRULY JUDGE THAT HE EXISTS
THIS QUESTION OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACT AND OBJECT IN OUR APPREHENDING OF THINGS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT SINCE OUR WHOLE POWER OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE IS BOUND UP WITH IT
AD INFINITUM IN TIME SIMILARLY HOWEVER LITTLE TIME MAY ELAPSE BETWEEN TWO MOMENTS IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER MOMENTS BETWEEN THEM THUS SPACE AND TIME APPEAR TO BE INFINITELY DIVISIBLE
HOW CAN THERE BE KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PROPOSITIONS IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE NOT EXAMINED ALL THE INSTANCES AND INDEED NEVER CAN EXAMINE THEM ALL BECAUSE THEIR NUMBER IS INFINITE
INDUCTION WHICH GOES FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE PARTICULAR OR FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE GENERAL IT IS AN OLD DEBATE AMONG PHILOSOPHERS WHETHER DEDUCTION EVER GIVES NEW KNOWLEDGE WE CAN NOW SEE THAT IN CERTAIN CASES AT LEAST IT DOES DO SO
IS PECULIARLY LIABLE TO ERROR BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE A FRESH DATUM
BUT IT IS OFTEN A DIFFICULT MATTER TO COME WELL OUT OF IT DON QUIXOTE A MADMAN AND WE SANE HE GOES OFF LAUGHING SAFE AND SOUND AND YOU ARE LEFT SORE AND SORRY I'D LIKE TO KNOW NOW WHICH IS THE MADDER HE WHO IS SO BECAUSE HE CANNOT HELP IT
AY LET HIM TACKLE THEM AND HE'LL SEE HOW HE'LL GET OUT OF THEIR HANDS
WHO WAS A MAIDEN AND NOW BY HIS MISDEED IS NONE AND SAY THAT HE SHALL FULFILL THE PROMISE HE GAVE HER TO BECOME HER LAWFUL HUSBAND OR ELSE STAKE HIS LIFE UPON THE QUESTION
FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
I BEGGED THIS LADY DUENNA HERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM WHEN I CAME INTO THE CASTLE AND SHE GOT AS ANGRY AS IF I HAD SAID SHE WAS UGLY OR OLD THOUGH IT OUGHT TO BE MORE NATURAL AND PROPER FOR DUENNAS TO FEED ASSES THAN TO ORNAMENT CHAMBERS
INSOMUCH THAT HE SET HIM DOWN AS A MONSTER OF SOME KIND
THEN SHALL MY TALE BY LOVE ITSELF BE TOLD THE UNISON OF OPPOSITES TO PROVE OF THE SOFT WAX AND DIAMOND HARD AM I BUT STILL OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS OF LOVE
SEEING HIS MASTER RETIRING TO RUN HIS COURSE DID NOT LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE NOSY MAN FEARING THAT WITH ONE FLAP OF THAT NOSE ON HIS OWN THE BATTLE WOULD BE ALL OVER FOR HIM AND HE WOULD BE LEFT STRETCHED ON THE GROUND EITHER BY THE BLOW OR WITH FRIGHT
A RESPECTABLE WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A BROKEN LEG AND KEEP AT HOME AND TO BE BUSY AT SOMETHING IS A VIRTUOUS DAMSEL'S HOLIDAY
KEEP THEM AS DRY AS BARLEY SPEARS AND SO I SAY IT WITHOUT TEARS
WITH WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT
AND SOON AFTER THEY HEARD ANOTHER NOT NOISE BUT SOUND OF SWEET HARMONIOUS MUSIC OF WHICH SANCHO WAS VERY GLAD TAKING IT TO BE A GOOD SIGN AND SAID HE TO THE DUCHESS
THIS IS THE WAY A LANGUAGE IS ENRICHED CUSTOM AND THE PUBLIC ARE ALL POWERFUL THERE IN TRUTH SENOR SAID SANCHO ONE OF THE COUNSELS AND CAUTIONS I MEAN TO BEAR IN MIND SHALL BE THIS NOT TO BELCH FOR I'M CONSTANTLY DOING IT
IF HE MADE FOUR BALLAD STANZAS OF FOUR LINES EACH THERE WOULD BE A LETTER OVER AND IF HE MADE THEM OF FIVE WHAT THEY CALLED DECIMAS OR
I HAVE HERE TWO LINEN BAGS OF THE SAME SIZE YOU SHALL TAKE ONE AND I THE OTHER AND WE WILL FIGHT AT BAG BLOWS WITH EQUAL ARMS
AND IF NOW I DO NOT COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST
AND AN EXPRESSION BETWEEN GRAVE AND GAY AND HIS DRESS AND ACCOUTREMENTS SHOWED HIM TO BE A MAN OF GOOD CONDITION
AND HERE ARE THREE JUST THIS INSTANT COME INTO MY HEAD PAT TO THE PURPOSE AND LIKE PEARS IN A BASKET BUT I WON'T REPEAT THEM FOR SAGE SILENCE IS CALLED SANCHO THAT SANCHO THOU ART NOT SAID DON QUIXOTE
AND THOUGH SORROWS MISFORTUNES AND CALAMITIES HAVE MADE MY HEART THEIR ABODE THE COMPASSION I FEEL FOR THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS HAS NOT BEEN THEREBY BANISHED FROM IT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE JUST NOW SUNG
ONCE UPON A TIME CALLED ALDONZA LORENZO JUST AS I CALL MINE CASILDEA DE VANDALIA BECAUSE HER NAME IS CASILDA AND SHE IS OF ANDALUSIA IF ALL THESE TOKENS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO VINDICATE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY
WHEREIN THOU ART ABOUT TO INGULF THYSELF FOR OFFICES AND GREAT TRUSTS ARE NOTHING ELSE BUT A MIGHTY GULF OF TROUBLES FIRST OF ALL MY SON THOU MUST FEAR GOD FOR IN THE FEAR OF HIM IS WISDOM
POURED OUT ON THE BACHELOR WERE PAST COUNTING THEY TORE THEIR HAIR THEY CLAWED THEIR FACES AND IN THE STYLE OF THE HIRED MOURNERS THAT WERE ONCE IN FASHION
WENT AND STOOD OVER HIM OF THE MIRRORS AND UNLACING HIS HELMET TO SEE IF HE WAS DEAD AND TO GIVE HIM AIR IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ALIVE HE SAW
I HAVE SEEN MORE THAN TWO ASSES GO TO GOVERNMENTS AND FOR ME TO TAKE MINE WITH ME WOULD BE NOTHING NEW SANCHO'S WORDS MADE THE DUCHESS LAUGH AGAIN AND GAVE HER FRESH AMUSEMENT
IT WILL NOT BE WITH MY WILL AND CONSENT I WAS ALWAYS A LOVER OF EQUALITY BROTHER AND I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE PEOPLE GIVE THEMSELVES AIRS WITHOUT ANY RIGHT THEY CALLED ME TERESA AT MY BAPTISM
THE HIGHEST AND CHOICEST BRINGS WITH IT A HEAVY BURDEN OF CARES AND TROUBLES WHICH THE UNHAPPY WIGHT TO WHOSE LOT IT HAS FALLEN BEARS UPON HIS SHOULDERS FAR BETTER WOULD IT BE FOR US
THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE REPLIED THE BACHELOR FOR THEY ARE SO GOOD AND SO FAT AND SO WELL BRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SAY ONE THING FOR ANOTHER THOUGH THEY WERE TO BURST FOR IT IN SHORT THEN MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER THAT IS ALL
AND HOW DO I KNOW BUT THAT IN THESE GOVERNMENTS THE DEVIL MAY HAVE PREPARED SOME TRIP FOR ME TO MAKE ME LOSE MY FOOTING AND FALL AND KNOCK MY GRINDERS OUT SANCHO I WAS BORN AND SANCHO I MEAN TO DIE
SHE READ OUT AS FOLLOWS TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS THE LETTER YOUR HIGHNESS WROTE ME MY LADY GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE FOR INDEED I FOUND IT VERY WELCOME
AND BY NIGHT ALL CATS ARE GREY AND A HARD CASE ENOUGH HIS WHO HASN'T BROKEN HIS FAST AT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON AND THERE'S NO STOMACH A HAND'S BREADTH BIGGER THAN ANOTHER
AND I SAY ONCE MORE IF YOUR LADYSHIP DOES NOT LIKE TO GIVE ME THE ISLAND BECAUSE I'M A FOOL LIKE A WISE MAN I WILL TAKE CARE TO GIVE MYSELF NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT I HAVE HEARD SAY THAT BEHIND THE CROSS THERE'S THE DEVIL
THEY ALL FELT FRESH WONDER BUT PARTICULARLY SANCHO AND DON QUIXOTE SANCHO TO SEE HOW IN DEFIANCE OF THE TRUTH THEY WOULD HAVE IT THAT DULCINEA WAS ENCHANTED
WITH A COMPOSED AND DAUNTLESS AIR HE SAID TO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS IF SIR KNIGHT YOUR GREAT EAGERNESS TO FIGHT HAS NOT BANISHED YOUR COURTESY BY IT I WOULD ENTREAT YOU TO RAISE YOUR VISOR A LITTLE
UNLESS INDEED IT BE THAT AS HE HAS MANY ENEMIES WHO ARE ENCHANTERS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR WHO IS ALWAYS PERSECUTING HIM SOME ONE OF THESE MAY HAVE TAKEN HIS SHAPE IN ORDER TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE VANQUISHED
TOGETHER WITH THE SENSIBLE ORIGINAL AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO SQUIRES THE KNIGHTS AND THE SQUIRES MADE TWO PARTIES THESE TELLING THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
WITH THE MERE BREATH OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY THAT HAS BREATHED UPON THEE SEEST THYSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO GOVERNOR OF AN ISLAND AS THOUGH IT WERE A MERE MATTER OF COURSE THIS I SAY SANCHO THAT THOU ATTRIBUTE NOT THE FAVOUR THOU HAST RECEIVED TO THINE OWN MERITS
AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS MAY GOD GRANT AS MUCH HEALTH TO HIM OR TO ME IF I WANT TO LISTEN TO THEM SANCHO PANZA'S PROVERBS SAID THE DUCHESS
DO THOU THEREFORE O RHADAMANTHUS WHO SITTEST IN JUDGMENT WITH ME IN THE MURKY CAVERNS OF DIS AS THOU KNOWEST ALL THAT THE INSCRUTABLE FATES HAVE DECREED TOUCHING THE RESUSCITATION OF THIS DAMSEL
AND HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED THE TRANSLATOR OF THIS HISTORY WHEN HE COMES TO WRITE THIS FIFTH CHAPTER SAYS THAT HE CONSIDERS IT APOCRYPHAL
NOR DO THESE CARRY ME OFF DON QUIXOTE SURVEYED HIM TOO AND THOUGH FEAR HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIS FACULTIES HE COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE THE FIGURE SANCHO PRESENTED
AND PERCEIVED THAT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HIS IMPROVEMENT WAS TRUE FOR NOW AND THEN HE SPOKE IN A WAY THAT SURPRISED HIM THOUGH ALWAYS OR MOSTLY
AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
FEARLESS AND FIRM THOUGH ALL HELL SHOULD COME TO ATTACK ME WELL THEN IF I SEE ANOTHER DEVIL OR HEAR ANOTHER HORN LIKE THE LAST I'LL WAIT HERE AS MUCH AS IN FLANDERS SAID SANCHO
NOT ONLY HOWEVER WAS HE UNABLE TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS BUT AS COUNTLESS DRUMS AND TRUMPETS NOW HELPED TO SWELL THE DIN OF THE BELLS AND SHOUTS HE WAS MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
IN SUPPORT OF WHICH CLAIM I HAVE ALREADY TRAVELLED OVER THE GREATER PART OF SPAIN
I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
AND THESE JOINED WITH MY RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SMALL WILL MAKE YOU CONFESS THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN DISMOUNT AND PUT IN PRACTICE YOUR POSITIONS AND CIRCLES AND ANGLES AND SCIENCE FOR I HOPE TO MAKE YOU SEE STARS AT NOONDAY WITH MY RUDE RAW SWORDSMANSHIP
THE ONE WITH THE TROUGH PURSUED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT ENDEAVOURING WITH THE UTMOST PERSISTENCE TO THRUST IT UNDER HIS CHIN WHILE ANOTHER KITCHEN BOY SEEMED ANXIOUS TO WASH HIS BEARD WHAT IS ALL THIS BROTHERS ASKED THE DUCHESS WHAT IS IT
I MEAN TO SAY MY BEARD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BE IT SAID I'LL GIVE HIM A PUNCH THAT WILL LEAVE MY FIST SUNK IN HIS SKULL
WHAT WORTHY SANCHO HAS SAID FOR IT WILL RAISE IT A GOOD SPAN HIGHER
FOR IN THE NAME OF SENOR DON QUIXOTE I CONFER UPON YOU THE GOVERNMENT OF ONE OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE THAT I HAVE AT MY DISPOSAL
AND REMEMBER SANCHO DILIGENCE IS THE MOTHER OF GOOD FORTUNE AND INDOLENCE ITS OPPOSITE NEVER YET ATTAINED THE OBJECT OF AN HONEST AMBITION THE LAST COUNSEL I WILL GIVE THEE NOW THOUGH IT DOES NOT TEND TO BODILY IMPROVEMENT
BUT ONE DAY AT TABLE WITH THE DUKE AND DUCHESS JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO CARRY HIS RESOLUTION INTO EFFECT AND ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION LO AND BEHOLD SUDDENLY THERE CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE GREAT HALL TWO WOMEN
THE GREAT ROGUE AND RASCAL THAT MY MASTER AND I FREED FROM THE CHAIN THAT IS NOT WHERE THE MISTAKE IS REPLIED SAMSON
DULCINEA IS ILLUSTRIOUS AND WELL BORN AND OF ONE OF THE GENTLE FAMILIES OF EL TOBOSO WHICH ARE MANY ANCIENT AND GOOD THEREIN MOST ASSUREDLY NOT SMALL IS THE SHARE OF THE PEERLESS DULCINEA THROUGH WHOM HER TOWN WILL BE FAMOUS AND CELEBRATED IN AGES TO COME
I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
PERHAPS THEY WILL COME BACK AND THEY WILL BE SURE TO FIND THOSE WHO WILL TAKE THEM FOR WIVES WITH ALL THEIR BLEMISHES GOOD OR BAD
AND MORE BENT THAN EVER UPON THE PLAN THEY HAD OF PRACTISING SOME JOKES UPON THEM THAT SHOULD HAVE THE LOOK AND APPEARANCE OF ADVENTURES THEY TOOK AS THEIR BASIS OF ACTION WHAT DON QUIXOTE HAD ALREADY TOLD THEM ABOUT THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS
UNDER THE PENALTY OF CEASING TO BE ONE TO RETURN AND RENDER HIM AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER BUT DON QUIXOTE WAS OF ONE MIND HE OF THE MIRRORS OF ANOTHER FOR HE JUST THEN HAD NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING
IF SUCH BE THE PLEASURE OF THE MOST HIGH SOME TAKE THE BROAD ROAD OF OVERWEENING AMBITION OTHERS THAT OF MEAN AND SERVILE FLATTERY OTHERS THAT OF DECEITFUL HYPOCRISY AND SOME THAT OF TRUE RELIGION BUT I LED BY MY STAR FOLLOW THE NARROW PATH OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
BUT TO MARRY SUCH AN ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN AS HAS BEEN JUST NOW DESCRIBED TO US INDEED INDEED THOUGH IT WAS A FOLLY IT WAS NOT SUCH A GREAT ONE AS YOU THINK FOR ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MY MASTER HERE AND
AND I SAY IT NOW ONCE MORE A KNIGHT ERRANT WITHOUT A LADY IS LIKE A TREE WITHOUT LEAVES A BUILDING WITHOUT A FOUNDATION OR A SHADOW WITHOUT THE BODY THAT CAUSES IT THERE IS NO DENYING IT SAID THE DUCHESS BUT STILL
BEAR IN MIND THAT THE CULPRIT WHO COMES UNDER THY JURISDICTION IS BUT A MISERABLE MAN SUBJECT TO ALL THE PROPENSITIES OF OUR DEPRAVED NATURE AND SO FAR AS MAY BE IN THY POWER SHOW THYSELF LENIENT AND FORBEARING
SAID THE DUKE BUT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE AS GOOD A GOVERNOR AS YOUR SAGACITY PROMISES AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY AND NOW REMEMBER TO MORROW IS THE DAY YOU MUST SET OUT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAND
BEGONE YE MINISTERS OF HELL I'M NOT MADE OF BRASS NOT TO FEEL SUCH OUT OF THE WAY TORTURES AT THIS INSTANT ALTISIDORA WHO PROBABLY WAS TIRED OF HAVING BEEN SO LONG LYING ON HER BACK
SO THAT I WAS RIGHT IN SAYING I WOULD BE GLAD IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL NOT TO BE WELL PLEASED
BY MY FAITH SENOR BACHELOR IF YOUR WORSHIP TAKES MY ADVICE YOU WILL NEVER CHALLENGE ANYONE TO FENCE AGAIN ONLY TO WRESTLE AND THROW THE BAR FOR YOU HAVE THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THESE FENCERS AS THEY CALL THEM I HAVE HEARD SAY
AND I TOO ADDED HER DAUGHTER ALL IN TEARS AND COVERED WITH SHAME AND CONFUSION THIS DECLARATION HAVING BEEN MADE AND THE DUKE HAVING SETTLED IN HIS OWN MIND WHAT HE WOULD DO IN THE MATTER
I AM NO SAINT REPLIED THE GENTLEMAN BUT A GREAT SINNER BUT YOU ARE BROTHER FOR YOU MUST BE A GOOD FELLOW AS YOUR SIMPLICITY SHOWS SANCHO WENT BACK AND REGAINED HIS PACK SADDLE HAVING EXTRACTED A LAUGH FROM HIS MASTER'S PROFOUND MELANCHOLY
THOUGH YOU SEEM TO BE THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO ARE NOT SO
AND USED TO GO TO MASS WITH THE TAIL OF HER PETTICOAT OVER HER HEAD INSTEAD OF A MANTLE AND THERE SHE GOES TO DAY IN A HOOPED GOWN WITH HER BROACHES AND AIRS AS IF WE DIDN'T KNOW HER
WHO IN AN EQUALLY CALM VOICE SAID IN REPLY PLEDGES DON'T DISTRESS A GOOD PAYER HE WHO HAS SUCCEEDED IN VANQUISHING YOU ONCE WHEN TRANSFORMED SIR DON QUIXOTE
GAUNT FEATURES LONG LANK LIMBS WITH HAIR TURNING GREY
AS HE BRINGS WITH HIM HER WHOM THEY CALL DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO THAT HE MAY SHOW THEE WHAT IS NEEDFUL IN ORDER TO DISENCHANT HER AND AS I CAME FOR NO MORE I NEED STAY NO LONGER
ONE OF THEM WAS THAT I WAS TO BE LET SAY ALL I LIKED SO LONG AS IT WAS NOT AGAINST MY NEIGHBOUR OR YOUR WORSHIP'S AUTHORITY AND SO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME I HAVE NOT BROKEN THE SAID ARTICLE
THOU ART NOT TO REPEL OR SLIGHT HIM BUT ON THE CONTRARY TO WELCOME HIM ENTERTAIN HIM AND MAKE MUCH OF HIM
THAT WILL NOT DO SAID THE OTHER FOR WE MUST PUT INTO THE BAGS TO KEEP THE WIND FROM BLOWING THEM AWAY HALF A DOZEN NICE SMOOTH PEBBLES ALL OF THE SAME WEIGHT
LEFT THEM BOTH ENCHANTED BY HIS ART ON THE GRAVE ITSELF SHE BEING CHANGED INTO AN APE OF BRASS AND HE
CHAPTER THIRTY NINE IN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORY BY EVERY WORD THAT SANCHO UTTERED THE DUCHESS WAS AS MUCH DELIGHTED AS DON QUIXOTE WAS DRIVEN TO DESPERATION
HE MIGHT PERHAPS FORGET HIS FOLLY OR THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOVERING SOME READY REMEDY FOR HIS MADNESS
IT HAS NOT DONE SO ON THE CONTRARY NOW THAT I KNOW I AM LEFT MORE AMAZED AND ASTONISHED THAN BEFORE WHAT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE KNIGHTS ERRANT IN THE WORLD IN THESE DAYS AND HISTORIES OF REAL CHIVALRY PRINTED
AS NOT TO HAVE A HACK AND A COUPLE OF GREYHOUNDS AND A FISHINGROD TO AMUSE HIMSELF WITH IN HIS OWN VILLAGE
TO WHATEVER THE GOVERNOR MAY SAY THERE'S NO ANSWER ANY MORE THAN TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH MY WIFE AND THEN AS FOR THAT ABOUT THE STONE AND THE PITCHER A BLIND MAN COULD SEE THAT
NOR DOES HE KNOW WHO HAS GOT IT AND WE CANNOT SAY WHETHER IT WILL APPEAR OR NOT AND SO ON THAT HEAD AS SOME SAY THAT NO SECOND PART HAS EVER BEEN GOOD
YOU NEVER HEARD IT IN ALL YOUR LIFE AND I DO NOT GIVE MY OWN NOTIONS FOR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY ARE THE OPINIONS OF HIS REVERENCE THE PREACHER WHO PREACHED IN THIS TOWN LAST LENT AND WHO SAID IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
ARM ME THEN IN GOD'S NAME SAID SANCHO AND THEY AT ONCE PRODUCED TWO LARGE SHIELDS THEY HAD COME PROVIDED WITH AND PLACED THEM UPON HIM OVER HIS SHIRT WITHOUT LETTING HIM PUT ON ANYTHING ELSE
BUT FOR ALL THAT REALLY AND BEYOND ALL QUESTION
WHEN THEY ARE GODFATHERS IN ANY QUARREL NOT TO STAND IDLE WITH FOLDED ARMS WHILE THEIR GODSONS FIGHT I SAY SO TO REMIND YOU THAT WHILE OUR MASTERS ARE FIGHTING WE TOO HAVE TO FIGHT AND KNOCK ONE ANOTHER TO SHIVERS
DECEIVED NOT BY HIM BUT BY ME UNDER THE TITLE OF A LAWFUL HUSBAND FOR SINNER THOUGH I WAS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO APPROACH THE EDGE OF HER SHOE SOLE WITHOUT BEING HER HUSBAND NO NO NOT THAT
THOUGH THE DEVIL SHOULD CARRY ME OFF HERE DON QUIXOTE TOO BROKE SILENCE SAYING TO SANCHO HAVE PATIENCE MY SON AND GRATIFY THESE NOBLE PERSONS AND GIVE ALL THANKS TO HEAVEN
STILL RETURNED HE OF THE GROVE
THE DUKE WAS ASTOUNDED THE DUCHESS AMAZED DON QUIXOTE WONDERING
FOR I SINNER THAT I AM GOD HELP ME DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE SCUFFLES AH SENOR GOVERNOR SAID ANOTHER WHAT SLACKNESS OF
SUCCOURING WIDOWS PROTECTING MAIDENS AND GIVING AID TO WIVES ORPHANS AND MINORS THE PROPER AND NATURAL DUTY OF KNIGHTS ERRANT AND THEREFORE BECAUSE OF MY MANY VALIANT AND CHRISTIAN ACHIEVEMENTS
THEY STOOD ENTRANCED LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR SOULS THEY SEEMED TO HUNGER AND THIRST AFTER THIS MUSIC AND THE STRAINS OF THE INSPIRED CELTIC RACE SEEMED TO COME TO THEM LIKE THE REVELATION OF THE GLORY OF HEAVEN THEN I PLAYED MORE LIVELY AIRS
I RAISED MY RIFLE AND TOOK AIM THEN IN QUICK SUCCESSION TWO REPORTS THUNDERED OUT WITH TREMENDOUS UPROAR AND INTERMINABLE ECHOES BUT THE LONG REVERBERATIONS WERE UNHEEDED IN THE BLAZE OF SUDDEN LIGHT AND THE VISION THAT WAS REVEALED
I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HORROR AT THE MERCILESS DESTRUCTION OF BRAVE COMRADES WHOSE WOUNDS SO GALLANTLY RECEIVED SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO INSPIRE PITY EVEN IN A HEART OF STONE THE GENTLENESS THE INCESSANT KINDNESS
AT LENGTH I ROSE FROM MY KNEES AND SANK DOWN UPON THE SEAT OF THE BOAT AND TRIED TO PEER THROUGH THE GLOOM IN VAIN
AND RICHES SHALL BE UNKNOWN IN THE LAND THESE EXTRAORDINARY WORDS SEEMED TO FILL THE PAUPERS WITH RAPTURE EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY BURST FROM THEM THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES IN AN IRREPRESSIBLE IMPULSE
THE MONSTER DID NOT COME BACK EITHER THE FLASH AND THE NOISE HAD TERRIFIED HIM OR THE BULLETS HAD HIT HIM OR ELSE IN HIS VASTNESS HE HAD BEEN INDIFFERENT TO SO FEEBLE A CREATURE AS MYSELF
THEN CAME SNOW AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND WE DRIFTED AMID ICEBERGS AND MOLTEN LAVA UNTIL WE ENTERED AN IRON PORTAL AND PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS HERE THERE WERE VAST SWIMMING MONSTERS AND BURNING ORBS OF FIRE AND THUNDEROUS CATARACTS
THE EXCITEMENT GREW INTENSE THE BETTING CHANGED ITS FORM BUT WAS STILL KEPT UP UNTIL AT LAST THE TWO PAPER BOATS SEEMED BLENDED TOGETHER IN ONE DIM SPOT WHICH GRADUALLY FADED OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS NOW NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF THE RACE
THUS FAR I HAD SEEN GALLEYS PASSING AND SMALL BOATS BUT THEY HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF ME FOR THE REASON THAT THEY WERE TOO FAR AWAY TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING ABOUT ME THAT DIFFERED FROM ANY OTHER BOAT BUT NOW AS I ROWED I NOTICED A GALLEY COMING DOWN TOWARD ME
ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CHANGE INSTEAD OF SHINING BEFORE ME IT APPEARED MORE ON MY LEFT
AND AS I STOOD WAITING FOR THE ONSET AND LISTENING FOR THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE EXCITEMENT THAT ENSUED WAS A POSITIVE RELIEF FROM THE DULL DESPAIR INTO WHICH I HAD SUNK BUT A MOMENT BEFORE YET THOUGH I WAITED FOR A NEW ATTACK I WAITED IN VAIN
MY LIFE HAD BEEN SUCH THAT I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN ANYONE WHOM I LOVED AND HERE ALMAH WAS THE ONE CONGENIAL ASSOCIATE IN A WHOLE WORLD OF ALIENS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC AND I LOVED HER DEARLY EVEN BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY FEELINGS WERE
SHE NEVER WILL SAID I OH YES SAID LAYELAH I WILL TELL HER THAT YOU WISH IT I DO NOT WISH IT SAID I I LOVE HER AND WILL NEVER GIVE HER UP IT'S ALL THE SAME SAID LAYELAH YOU CANNOT MARRY HER AT ALL
SOON NEARLY ALL WERE GONE EXCEPT THE PAUPERS AT THE FOOT OF THE PYRAMID WHO WERE AWAITING OUR COMMANDS AND A CROWD OF MELEKS AND ATHONS AT A DISTANCE AT A GESTURE FROM ME THE FEW PAUPERS NEAR US DESCENDED AND JOINED THOSE BELOW
YET IN SPITE OF THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH SHE MADE HER INQUIRIES AND THE DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE NOTED ALL DOWN I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS IN HER MIND SOMETHING LYING BENEATH IT ALL A FAR MORE EARNEST PURPOSE AND A FAR MORE PERSONAL ONE THAN THE PURSUIT OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE
THAT YOU WOULD LESSEN HER GLOOM AND THAT SHE WOULD BE PLEASANT TO YOU I FOUND OUT SOON THAT I WAS RIGHT AND I FELT GLAD FOR YOU AT ONCE SHOWED THE FULLEST SYMPATHY WITH ONE ANOTHER NEVER TILL YOU CAME WAS ALMAH HAPPY WITH US BUT SINCE YOU HAVE COME SHE HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT BEING
FOR IN THAT DARKNESS THERE WERE NO VISIBLE OBJECTS BY WHICH I COULD FIND OUT THE RATE OF MY PROGRESS AND AS THOSE WHO GO UP IN BALLOONS ARE UTTERLY INSENSIBLE OF MOTION
IT'S ONLY A ROUND SPOT LIKE THE FLOAT OF SOME NET OH IT'S A SPAR SAID MELICK IT'S ONE END OF IT THE REST IS UNDER WATER THE SPOT THUS CHOSEN WAS A DARK CIRCULAR OBJECT ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
ALL THE TIME IT CONTINUED TO GROW FAINTER AND IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT I WAS MOVING AWAY FROM IT RATHER THAN TOWARD IT IN THE MIDST OF THIS THERE OCCURRED A NEW THOUGHT WHICH SEEMED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS LIGHT
I TOOK HIS HANDS IN MINE AND PRESSED THEM IN DEEP EMOTION HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SWEET AND GENTLE SMILE I SEE IT ALL SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE YOU LOVE HER ATAM OR I PRESSED HIS HANDS HARDER BUT SAID NOTHING INDEED I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR ME TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE BEFORE I SHOULD KNOW THE WORST I TOOK MY PISTOL AND LOADED IT SO AS TO BE PREPARED BUT HESITATED TO USE IT UNTIL MY FATE SHOULD BE MORE APPARENT SO I SAT HOLDING MY PISTOL
I HAD NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOON WHEN IT RISES FROM BEHIND CLOUDS AND GLOWS RED AND LURID FROM THE HORIZON AND SO THIS GLOWED BUT NOT WITH THE STEADY LIGHT OF THE MOON
THE SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL HAD RUSHED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND HAD CARRIED ME HERE HERE CAME ALL THE WATERS OF THE NORTHERN OCEAN POURING INTO THIS VAST POLAR SEA PERHAPS TO ISSUE FORTH FROM IT BY SOME SIMILAR PASSAGE HERE THEN WAS THE SOUTH POLE
SO AS TO MAKE WAY FOR SOMETHING AND THROUGH THE PASSAGE THUS FORMED I SAW A NUMBER OF YOUTHS IN LONG ROBES WHO ADVANCED TO THE PYRAMID SINGING AS THEY WENT THEN THEY ASCENDED THE STEPS TWO BY TWO STILL SINGING
WHY SAID LAYELAH NOW YOU TALK JUST LIKE THE KOSEKIN YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE ONE OF US YOU LOVE DEATH FOR THE SAKE OF ALMAH WHY NOT BE MORE LIKE THE KOSEKIN AND SEEK AFTER A SEPARATION FROM ALMAH LAYELAH WAS NOT AT ALL OFFENDED AT MY DECLARATION OF LOVE FOR ALMAH
A WORLD BY ITSELF AND HOW DIFFERENT FROM THAT TERRIBLE THAT IRON LAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS NOT A WORLD OF ICE AND FROST BUT ONE OF BEAUTY AND LIGHT WITH A CLIMATE THAT WAS ALMOST TROPICAL IN ITS WARMTH
SO AS TO USE THEM AT THE AWFUL SACRIFICES AFTER THAT I WOULD PLAY NO MORE IT IS A LAND OF TENDER LOVE AND REMORSELESS CRUELTY MUSIC IS ALL POWERFUL TO AWAKEN THE ONE BUT POWERLESS TO ABATE THE OTHER
IN LONG SHOUTS OF RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE AMID THIS THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WERE CARRIED DOWN FROM THE PYRAMID AND WERE TAKEN TO THE MISTA KOSEK IN A LONG AND SOLEMN PROCESSION
BUT LAYELAH WAS QUITE READY WITH HER REPLY IF YOU LOVE ALMAH SAID SHE THAT IS THE VERY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD MARRY ME THIS MADE ME FEEL MORE EMBARRASSED THAN EVER
SOME I PLAYED A SECOND TIME SINGING THE WORDS THEY SEEMED EAGER TO HAVE THE SAME ONE PLAYED OFTEN AT LAST A GRISLY THOUGHT CAME TO ME IT WAS THAT THEY WOULD LEARN THESE SWEET STRAINS AND PUT THEIR OWN WORDS TO THEM
HER CHEEKS WHICH SHORTLY BEFORE HAD FLUSHED ROSY RED IN SWEET CONFUSION WERE NOW PALLID HER LIPS ASHEN
WITH EMACIATED FORMS AND FACES AND COARSE SQUALID ATTIRE WHO LOOKED LIKE THE MOST ABJECT PAUPERS AND SEEMED THE LOWEST IN THE LAND AS THE KOHEN REACHED THE SUMMIT THERE AROSE A STRANGE SOUND
A MOURNFUL PLAINTIVE CHANT WHICH SEEMED TO BE SUNG CHIEFLY BY THE PAUPERS AT THE BASE OF THE PYRAMID THE WORDS OF THIS CHANT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT THE MELANCHOLY STRAIN AFFECTED ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF
WHILE THE PAUPERS BELOW JOINED IN THE STRAIN AND NOW THE SUN WAS ALMOST HIDDEN AND THERE WAS ONLY THE FAINTEST LINE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF HIS DISK PERCEPTIBLE OVER THE ICY MOUNTAIN TOPS THE LIGHT WAS A SOFTENED TWILIGHT GLOW
OF THE CANNIBAL SAVAGES ON THOSE DREAR OUTER SHORES WHO RECEIVED US WITH SUCH HOSPITALITY BUT ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT DESTROY US AT LAST MIGHT THEY NOT ALL BELONG TO THE SAME RACE DWELLING AS THEY DID IN CAVERNS SHUNNING THE SUNLIGHT
HER ARMS WERE ABOUT ME AND SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY BUT LOOKED UP IN SWEET CONFUSION AND SAID WHY AS TO THAT I I CANNOT BE MORE YOUR YOUR WIFE THAN I AM
CHAPTER FIVE THE TORRENT SWEEPING UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THE BOAT DRIFTED ON THE LIGHT GIVEN BY THE AURORA AND THE LOW MOON SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER
I KNEW IT SAID HE IT IS BUT NATURAL YOU ARE BOTH OF A DIFFERENT RACE FROM US YOU ARE BOTH MUCH ALIKE AND IN FULL SYMPATHY WITH ONE ANOTHER THIS DRAWS YOU TOGETHER WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE A FIT COMPANION FOR HER HERE
IN THAT CASE THERE MIGHT BE NO SUDDEN PLUNGE AFTER ALL THE STREAM MIGHT RUN ON FOR MANY THOUSAND MILES THROUGH THIS TERRIFIC CAVERN GLOOM IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL LAWS AND I MIGHT THUS LIVE AND DRIFT ON IN THIS DARKNESS UNTIL I SHOULD DIE A LINGERING DEATH OF HORROR AND DESPAIR
AND MADE SOME REPLY TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE BELONGED TO A DIFFERENT RACE WITH DIFFERENT CUSTOMS BUT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW OUR CUSTOMS YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW YOU CAN EASILY FIND ANOTHER WHO WILL TAKE HIM ALMAH THREW A PITEOUS GLANCE AT ME AND SAID NOTHING
THIS THEN I THOUGHT IS THE END HERE AMID THIS DARKNESS I MUST MAKE THE AWFUL PLUNGE AND FIND MY DEATH I FELL UPON MY KNEES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND PRAYED AS I KNELT THERE THE BOAT DREW NEARER THE BLACK MASS GREW BLACKER
AND THE VIEW BEFORE ME SEEMED LIKE A WATERY DECLIVITY REACHING FOR A THOUSAND MILES TILL IT APPROACHED THE HORIZON FAR UP IN THE SKY NOR WAS IT ANY DELUSION OF THE SENSES THAT CAUSED THIS UNPARALLELED SPECTACLE
TO RISE AGAINST IT AND RESIST TO THE LAST SO I STOOD UP WITH MY RIFLE AND LISTENED WITH ALL MY SOUL IN MY SENSE OF HEARING THE SOUNDS AROSE MORE PLAINLY THEY HAD COME NEARER THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT
THE SHOCK OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS OVERPOWERING AND SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I COULD RALLY FROM IT THOUGH ALMAH'S LOVE WAS SWEET BEYOND EXPRESSION
THE FACT IS IT DOESN'T DO FOR WOMEN TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE IT'S NOT FAIR I HAD STOOD A GOOD DEAL AMONG THE KOSEKIN THEIR LOVE OF DARKNESS THEIR PASSION FOR DEATH THEIR CONTEMPT OF RICHES THEIR YEARNING AFTER UNREQUITED LOVE
LIGHT THAT BRINGS LIFE AND HOPE TO MAN AND I COULD HAVE FALLEN ON MY KNEES AND WORSHIPPED THAT RISING SUN BUT THE LIGHT WHICH WAS SO GLORIOUS TO US WAS PAINFUL AND DISTRESSING TO THE KOSEKIN
AND THE PAUPERS THE CHIEF PAUPER AND LAID THEM SIDE BY SIDE ON THE CENTRAL ALTAR AFTER THIS A HAG AND A PAUPER ADVANCED TOWARD US EACH CARRYING THE SACRIFICIAL KNIFE WHICH HAD BELONGED TO THE DECEASED
AND AT LENGTH REACHED THE SUMMIT WHERE THEY ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN ORDER THERE WERE THIRTY OF THEM AND THEY ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN THREE ROWS OF TEN EACH AND AS THEY STOOD THEY NEVER CEASED TO SING
THE OTHER WAS MUCH SMALLER AND WAS FOLDED IN THE SAME MATERIAL WITHOUT BEING BOUND THIS MELICK SEIZED AND BEGAN TO OPEN WAIT A MINUTE SAID FEATHERSTONE LET'S MAKE A BET ON IT FIVE GUINEAS THAT IT'S SOME SORT OF JEWELS DONE SAID OXENDEN
AND RULER OF CLOUDS AND DARKNESS HENCEFORTH YOU SHALL BE JUDGE OF DEATH TO THE MEN OF THE KOSEKIN AND SAR TABAKIN OVER THE WHOLE NATION I RECEIVED THE KNIFE IN SILENCE FOR I HAD NOTHING TO SAY
THE LIGHT GREW FAINTER UNTIL AT LAST ALL AROUND ME GREW DARK I WAS FLOATING AT THE BOTTOM OF A VAST CHASM WHERE THE SIDES SEEMED TO RISE PRECIPITOUSLY FOR THOUSANDS OF FEET WHERE NEITHER WATERY FLOOD NOR ROCKY WALL WAS VISIBLE
HELD THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH'S INTERIOR IS A MASS OF MOLTEN ROCK AND PENT UP FIRE AND THAT THE EARTH ITSELF HAD ONCE BEEN A BURNING ORB WHICH HAD COOLED DOWN AT THE SURFACE YET AFTER ALL THIS WAS ONLY A THEORY AND THERE WERE OTHER THEORIES WHICH WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS IN A RAPTURE OF JOY THIS REVULSION FROM THE LOWEST DESPAIR FROM DARKNESS AND FROM DEATH BACK TO HOPE AND LIGHT AND LIFE WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO ENDURE WE BOTH WEPT BUT OUR TEARS WERE THOSE OF HAPPINESS
I CANNOT TELL THE SWEET WORDS THAT SHE SAID TO ME BUT I NOW LEARNED THAT SHE HAD LOVED ME FROM THE FIRST WHEN I CAME TO HER IN HER LONELINESS WHEN SHE WAS HOMESICK AND HEARTSICK AND I CAME A KINDRED NATURE OF A RACE MORE LIKE HER OWN
THERE WAS A HORRIBLE FASCINATION ABOUT THE SCENE WHICH FORCED ME TO LOOK AND SEE ALL THE KOHEN TOOK THE VICTIM AND DRAWING IT FROM THE ALTAR THREW IT OVER THE PRECIPICE TO THE GROUND BENEATH THEN A LOUD SHOUT BURST FORTH FROM THE GREAT CROWD
HER MOURNFUL YET TRUSTFUL LOOK OH HEAVENS WOULD ALL THESE BE MINE NO MORE I COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT AT FIRST I WANDERED ABOUT SEEKING REST AND FINDING NONE AND AT LENGTH I SAT IN MY OWN ROOM AND PASSED THE TIME IN LISTENING
FOR THERE FULL BEFORE ME I SAW THOUGH BUT FOR AN INSTANT A TREMENDOUS SIGHT IT WAS A VAST MONSTER MOVING IN THE WATERS AGAINST THE STREAM AND TOWARD THE BOAT ITS HEAD WAS RAISED HIGH ITS EYES WERE INFLAMED WITH A BALEFUL LIGHT
ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF MEAT THAT MAY BE INSIDE MEAT CANS SAID MELICK ARE NEVER SO LARGE AS THAT OH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID THE DOCTOR THEY MAKE UP PRETTY LARGE PACKAGES OF PEMMICAN FOR THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS
SHE MAY MARRY MY PAPA THIS SUGGESTION FILLED ME WITH DISMAY OH NO SAID I NEVER NEVER WILL I GIVE UP ALMAH CERTAINLY NOT SAID LAYELAH YOU DO NOT GIVE HER UP SHE GIVES YOU UP
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY OUR FATE IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WHICH YOU KNOW AND WHICH I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU HAVE HEARD NOTHING SAID SHE SLOWLY AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD IS AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH WHAT LIES BEFORE US FOR YOU AND FOR ME THERE IS A FATE
I LOVE YOU I BUT HERE I WAS INTERRUPTED WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY FURTHER WORDS THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND ME AND CLUNG TO ME WITH A FOND EMBRACE AS FOR ME I WAS UTTERLY CONFOUNDED BEWILDERED AND DESPERATE
AND SHE SAW IN ME THE ONLY ONE OF ALL AROUND HER WHOM IT WAS POSSIBLE NOT TO DETEST AND THEREFORE SHE LOVED ME WE HAD MANY THINGS TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER AND LONG EXCHANGES OF CONFIDENCE TO MAKE
SO FEATHERSTONE ORDERED OUT THE BOAT THE FOUR WERE SOON EMBARKED AND THE MEN ROWED OUT TOWARD THE POINT WHICH HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE END OF THE RACE ON COMING NEAR
OH I MEAN A RACE WITH THESE PAPER BOATS WE CAN BET ON THEM YOU KNOW AT THIS FEATHERSTONE SAT UPRIGHT WITH HIS LEGS DANGLING OUT OF THE HAMMOCK BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED AGAIN BETTING SO WE CAN
PULL UP LADS A LITTLE LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME LIKE A SPAR THE OTHERS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST WERE ATTRACTED BY THESE WORDS AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE THING IN QUESTION THE MEN PULLED THE BOAT DREW NEARER
DO YOU THINK THAT I HAVE CONSENTED TO YOUR DEATH NEVER YOU ARE MINE I WILL SAVE YOU I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT WE CAN DO YOU SHALL ESCAPE CAN YOU REALLY SAVE ME I CRIED I CAN WHAT IN SPITE OF THE WHOLE NATION
OH HORROR HORROR HORROR OH HIDEOUS ABOMINATION AND DEED WITHOUT A NAME I COULD NOT SPEAK I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND WE BOTH WEPT PASSIONATELY THE HAPPINESS OF OUR LOVE WAS NOW DARKENED BY THIS TREMENDOUS CLOUD THAT LOWERED BEFORE US
OR FORCE HIS WAY BACK THROUGH SUCH APPALLING DANGERS OR IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE WHO COULD EVER HOPE TO BREAST THOSE MIGHTY CURRENTS BEYOND OR WORK HIS WAY AMID EVERLASTING ICE AND IMMEASURABLE SEAS NO RETURN WAS IMPOSSIBLE
ALMAH SAID SHE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM US SHE LOVES YOU AND YOU LOVE HER SHE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU UP ALMAH YOU OUGHT TO GIVE UP ATAM OR SINCE YOU LOVE HIM ALMAH LOOKED CONFUSED
THERE WAS RATHER TWILIGHT THAN DARKNESS AND THIS TWILIGHT CONTINUED LONG ALL THIS ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE EFFECT OF THIS STRIKING SCENE AND AS THE LIGHT FADED AWAY I LOOKED WITH INCREASING CURIOSITY
ANGUISH AND DESPAIR HOW IT ALL ENDED I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I KNOW HOW I GOT AWAY FROM THE PLACE FOR I ONLY REMEMBER COMING BACK TO MY SENSES IN THE LIGHTED GROTTO WITH ALMAH BENDING ANXIOUSLY OVER ME
YET IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC THERE COULD BE NO PLACE LIKE THIS NO IMMEASURABLE EXPANSE OF WATERS NO HORIZON RAISED MOUNTAIN HIGH IT SEEMED LIKE A VAST BASIN SHAPED WORLD FOR ALL AROUND ME THE SURFACE APPEARED TO RISE
I COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DEEP AFFECTION I FEEL FOR ALMAH AND FOR YOU AND FOR THE REASON THAT I AM JUST NOW MORE MOVED THAN USUAL AND HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER MY FEELINGS SAYING THIS HE PRESSED MY HAND AND LEFT ME
IT WAS A SOUND THAT SPOKE OF LIFE I HEARD QUICK HEAVY PANTINGS AS OF SOME GREAT LIVING THING AND WITH THIS THERE CAME THE NOISE OF REGULAR MOVEMENTS IN THE WATER AND THE FOAMING AND GURGLING OF WAVES
ON THE WHOLE I FELT MORE THAN EVER PUZZLED AND LESS ABLE THAN EVER TO UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE I LOVED THEM YET LOATHED THEM FOR THE KOHEN I HAD AT ONCE AFFECTION AND HORROR
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PHENOMENA OF THE MIRAGE AND KNEW WELL THAT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THAT KIND HERE FOR THE MIRAGE ALWAYS SHOWS GREAT SURFACES OF STILLNESS OR A REGULAR VIBRATION GLASSY TIDES AND INDISTINCT DISTANCES
ABOUT HER SWEET AND GRACIOUS DISPOSITION THE LOVE THAT ALL FELT FOR HER THE DEEP AND INTENSE INTEREST WHICH HER ILLNESS HAD AROUSED IN ALL THIS HE SEEMED MORE LIKE A MAN OF MY OWN RACE THAN BEFORE
I KNEW NO OTHER WORD THAN THE ONE KOSEKIN WORD MEANING LOVE AND COULD NOT THINK OF ANY MEANING LIKE IT WAS THEREFORE A VERY TRYING POSITION FOR ME DEAR LAYELAH SAID I FLOUNDERING AND STAMMERING IN MY CONFUSION
SAYING THIS HE WENT TO THE SIDE FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS AND ALL LOOKED OUT CAREFULLY OVER THE WATER THERE'S A BLACK SPECK OUT THERE SAID OXENDEN SO THERE IS SAID FEATHERSTONE THAT'LL DO I WONDER WHAT IT IS
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF FORMING ANY ESTIMATE AS TO SPEED ALL WAS DARK AND EVEN THE GLOW BEHIND WAS FADING AWAY NOR COULD I MAKE ANY CONJECTURE WHATEVER AS TO THE SIZE OF THE CHANNEL AT THE OPENING IT HAD BEEN CONTRACTED AND NARROW
I COULD DIE HAPPY NOW SINCE I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME DEATH SAID I DO NOT TALK OF IT DO NOT MENTION THAT WORD IT IS MORE ABHORRENT THAN EVER NO ALMAH LET US LIVE AND LOVE LET US HOPE LET US FLY
BUT NOW ALMAH SPOKE AS WAS FITTING FOR HER TO DO SINCE WITH THE KOSEKIN THE WOMEN MUST TAKE THE PRECEDENCE AND HERE IT WAS EXPECTED THAT SHE SHOULD REPLY IN BEHALF OF BOTH OF US SO ALMAH HOLDING THE SACRIFICIAL KNIFE
FALLING FROM INCONCEIVABLE HEIGHTS AND THE SWEEP OF IMMEASURABLE TIDES AND THE CIRCLING OF INFINITE WHIRLPOOLS WHILE IN MY EARS THERE RANG THE NEVER ENDING ROAR OF REMORSELESS WATERS THAT CAME AFTER US WITH ALL THEIR WAVES AND BILLOWS ROLLING UPON US
IT BECAME TO HIM UTTERLY CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME I THINK HE MEANS TO INTERFERE WITH ME AND I DO NOT MEAN TO STAND HIS INTERFERENCE I SHOULD THINK NOT HE MUST GO BACK TO BUSTON AMONG THE BUSTONIANS OR HE AND I WILL HAVE A STAND UP FIGHT OF IT
IN THE TEETH OF ALL HIS LONGINGS IN OPPOSITION TO ALL HIS THIRST MOUNTJOY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO DID THINK THAT HE COULD RISE AND GO HIS FATHER WAS ABOUT TO PUT HIM ON HIS LEGS AGAIN IF ONLY HE WOULD ABSTAIN
IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT MISTER JONES WOULD NOT THUS HAVE EXPRESSED HIMSELF UNLESS HIS FRIEND AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH HAD DROPPED CERTAIN WORDS IN CONVERSATION IN REGARD TO HARRY TO THE SAME EFFECT
TO HIM IN PLAYING PIQUET WITH SUCH A FACE OPPOSITE TO HIM AS THAT OF CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES
WHO CAN SAY SIR WILLIAM BRODRICK WHEN THAT FEARFUL OPERATION WAS PERFORMED IN LONDON THOUGHT THAT A MONTH WOULD SEE THE END OF IT THAT IS EIGHT MONTHS AGO AND HE HAS MORE VITALITY NOW THAN HE HAD THEN
WHO PLAYED HIS CARDS WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND NEVER SPOKE A WORD EITHER THEN OR AT ANY OTHER PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HE WAS THE MOST TACITURN OF MEN AND WAS KNOWN NOT AT ALL TO ANY OF HIS COMPANIONS IT WAS RUMORED OF HIM
BUT IT CAME TO HER NATURALLY AS THE RESULT OF WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE
SOPHY WAS A GOOD DEAL HATED ALSO BEING A FORWARD FLIRTING TRICKY GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHO HAD JUST LEFT THE SCHOOL AT WHICH UNCLE JOHN HAD PAID FOR HER EDUCATION GEORGINA THE THIRD WAS STILL AT SCHOOL UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
WORSHIP AND OBEDIENCE
IN WHICH ONE GLASS WAS LEFT AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN WITH THE DOCUMENT IN HIS HAND JUST THE SAME FELLOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF OVERBEARING RECKLESS PIG HEADED AND A BULLY HE'D LOSE THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF HE HAD IT BUT THEN HE DON'T PAY
AND HAVE DECLARED THAT SHE REGARDED HIM ALREADY AS HER LORD AND MASTER BUT NOW SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY TO HIM ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HE HAD NOW PLEDGED HIMSELF TO HER AND THAT SHE INTENDED TO KEEP HIM TO HIS PLEDGE MAY I NOT HAVE ONE WORD
OH MISSUS ARMITAGE I AM SO OBLIGED TO YOU NO FELLOW WAS EVER SO OBLIGED TO A FRIEND BEFORE HOW HAS IT GONE OFF FOR MISSUS MOUNTJOY HAS TAKEN FLORENCE HOME OH YES SHE HAS TAKEN HER AWAY
I HAVE MY EYES OPEN AND CAN SEE AS WELL AS ANOTHER WHEN HARRY LECTURES ME ABOUT MY FATHER AND MY FATHER ABOUT ME
AT WHICH HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED NOW SHE CAME FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THAT PERIOD HAD ARRIVED
I DARE SAY DON'T SUPPOSE MISSUS ARMITAGE THAT I AM TAKING ANY PRIDE TO MYSELF
BUT I SHALL NOT CHANGE NOR I NOR I I THINK NOT BECAUSE I TRUST YOU HERE IS MAMMA AND NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU BUT I SHALL TELL MAMMA EVERYTHING BEFORE I GO TO BED
AUGUSTUS HAS HIS OWN DOUBTS THAT'S AN IMPERTINENT YOUNG PUPPY SAID SEPTIMUS JONES AS SOON AS THE FLY WHICH WAS TO CARRY HARRY ANNESLEY TO THE STATION HAD LEFT THE HALL DOOR ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
WELL YES I SUPPOSE IT WOULD THAT IS THE INTENTION BUT SOMEHOW IT FAILS WITH ME SOMETIMES DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HATE PEOPLE WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH AS MUCH AS WHEN YOU DON'T I AM NOT SURE THAT I HATE ANYBODY VERY MUCH I DO THAT
BUT THEN IT IS KNOWN OF THEM AND MOMENTARILY SEEN THAT THEIR GRACE IS PECULIAR
I BEGAN TO THINK OF COMING IMMEDIATELY THEN AN IDEA FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOT THROUGH FLORENCE'S MIND
IN EARLIER DAYS TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AT A TIME WHICH NOW SEEMED TO HIM TO BE VERY DISTANT HE HAD REGARDED FLORENCE AS HIS OWN AND AS SUCH HAD DEMANDED HER HAND
AND WHEN THE WORLD COMES TO UNDERSTAND THAT HARRY ANNESLEY IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE INQUIRIES KNOWS ALL ABOUT POOR MOUNTJOY WAS THE LAST TO SEE HIM IN LONDON AND HAS NEVER COME FORWARD TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HIM
AND ASKED THAT IT MIGHT BE ONLY TEN SHILLINGS A GAME
AND SHOULD THEN MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT IF HE DID NOT FOLLOW MY ADVICE I MUST WITHDRAW IF HIS SON IS WILLING TO PAY THESE MONEY LENDERS WHAT SUMS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ADVANCED AND IF BY ANY EFFORT ON HIS PART THE MONEY CAN BE RAISED LET IT BE DONE
HIS MANY PERIODS OF HEART RENDING LOSS WHICH WHEN THEY OCCURRED WOULD DRIVE HIM NEARLY MAD HIS SMALL CUSTOMARY GAINS
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING MORE TASTY THAN HER DRESS
TO THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER ANOTHER CHARMER HAD COME MOST OBJECTIONABLE IN HER SIGHT BUT TO HIM NO WORD OF ABSOLUTE ENCOURAGEMENT HAD AS SHE THOUGHT BEEN YET SPOKEN
AND TO LAW WHICH IS SO INTERESTING AS TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE I HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED YOUR FATHER AS A MOST EXCELLENT MAN BUT THOROUGHLY DISHONEST HE WOULD ROB ANY ONE BUT ALWAYS TO EKE OUT HIS OWN GIFTS TO OTHER PEOPLE HE HAS THEREFORE TO MY EYES BEEN MOST ROMANTIC
WELL IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THAT HE SHOULD NOT TRUST ME
OH MISTER ANNESLEY WHEN DID YOU COME TO CHELTENHAM
I SAW MOODY THIS MORNING AND HE SAID HE WOULD LOOK IN IF HE WAS PASSING THIS WAY NOW SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE YOU DISAPPEARED IN THAT REMARKABLE MANNER THIS WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT MOUNTJOY HAD EXPECTED
AUGUSTUS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED FOR HIMSELF AMONG HIS FRIENDS THE CHARACTER OF AN ELOQUENT YOUNG LAWYER LET HIM COME AND TRY HIS ELOQUENCE ON HIS COUSIN ONLY LET IT FIRST BE ASCERTAINED AS AN ASSURED FACT AND BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL RETROGRESSION
BUT HE HAS BEEN UTTERLY UNABLE TO READ ME I HAVE POURED OUT MY MONEY WITH OPEN HANDS FOR BOTH OF YOU THAT IS TRUE SIR CERTAINLY AS REGARDS ME AND HAVE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS QUITE HOPELESS WITH YOU I WENT ON AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON
SIMPLY AS A PIECE OF PREY WHOM CHANCE HAD THROWN UP ON THE SHORE AND MOODY WHO WOULD NO DOUBT SHOW HIMSELF BEFORE LONG WAS ANOTHER BIRD OF THE SAME COVEY THOUGH LESS RAPACIOUS MOUNTJOY PUT HIS HAND UP
SHE HERSELF WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HARRY'S WAY AND THAT SOMETHING WAS EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THIS SHORT MONTH OF HER ABSENCE WHICH MIGHT BE DETRIMENTAL TO HIM
SCARBOROUGH HAD KNOWN HARRY ANNESLEY FOR A LONG TIME AS TIME IS COUNTED IN EARLY YOUTH AND HAD BY DEGREES LEARNED TO HATE HIM THOROUGHLY
AND THOUGH SHE EVER DENIED THE IMPUTATION THERE CAME OVER HER GIRL'S HEART A FEELING VERY SAD AND VERY SOLEMN BUT STILL ALL BUT ACCEPTED THAT SO IT MUST BE THEN
AND THAT SUCH WORD IF EVER TO BE SPOKEN SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING THAT NIGHT WHAT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN TO A GIRL WHO WAS PASSING THE BALMY CHRISTMAS MONTHS AMID THE SWEET SHADOWS OF AN ITALIAN LAKE
SO HE BOLDLY WROTE DOWN HIS NAME FOR BOTH I ALMOST THINK THAT FLORENCE MUST HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HARRY ANNESLEY WAS TO BE THERE THAT NIGHT OR WHY SHOULD THE TWO PLACES HAVE BEEN KEPT VACANT AND NOW WHAT IS THIS HE BEGAN ABOUT YOUR GOING TO BRUSSELS
THAT WOULD BE INTENDED SAID DOLLY AND THEN HE WOULD COME BACK JUST THE SAME BUT IN THAT CASE HE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE THOUGH THEY WERE TO DECLARE THAT HE HADN'T A PAIR OF TROUSERS IN WHICH TO APPEAR AT A RACE COURSE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT MY DEAR SAID MISTER GREY
I DO MEAN IT MAMMA IS OF COURSE ATTACHED TO HER NEPHEW WHAT AFTER ALL THAT HAS PASSED WHY NOT IS HE TO BLAME FOR WHAT HIS FATHER HAS DONE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT PRESS THE CASE AGAINST CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH
IN THE EVENING WHEN THE DINNER THINGS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY A MATTER OF BUSINESS CAME UP AND TOOK THE PLACE OF THE PRINCE AND HIS MUSTACHES MISSUS CARROLL WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER HER BROTHER COULD LEND HER A SMALL SUM OF TWENTY POUNDS
DOLLY HAD GONE BACK TO HER BOOK AND DISDAINED TO MAKE ANY FARTHER REPLY HER FATHER FELT THAT QUITE ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID ABOUT IT AND WAS PREPARED TO GIVE THE TWENTY POUNDS UNDER THE IDEA
NOTHING WILL EVER KEEP HIM BACK WHEN CONVIVIALITY DEMANDS HIS PRESENCE THIS CAME FROM HIS AFFLICTED WIFE WHO IN SPITE OF ALL HIS MISFORTUNES WOULD EVER SPEAK WITH SOME RESPECT OF HER HUSBAND'S EMPLOYMENTS
I WON'T BE HALF A MOMENT SAID THE REPENTANT FATHER HASTENING UP STAIRS TO GO THROUGH HIS ORDINARY DRESSING ARRANGEMENT I WOULDN'T HURRY FOR HER SAID DOLLY BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL HURRY YOU ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU PAPA THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER
I THINK YOU HAVE AND BECAUSE YOU TELL ME SO I LIKE YOU ALL THE BETTER AS FOR AUGUSTUS BUT I WILL NOT BURDEN MY SPIRIT NOW AT THE LAST WITH UTTERING CURSES AGAINST MY OWN SON HE IS NOT WORTH IT
AND THEREFORE AS HE SAYS HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO BURDEN HIS WILL WITH LEGACIES THERE IS SOME PROVISION MADE FOR MY AUNT WHO HOWEVER HAS HER OWN FORTUNE HE HAS TOLD ME TO LOOK AFTER YOU IT WILL BE QUITE UNNECESSARY SAID MISTER MERTON
AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM A KEENER PERCEPTION OF HIS IMPERIOUSNESS SHE COULD CONSENT TO BECOME THE WIFE OF THE MAN WHO HAD SQUANDERED HIS PROPERTY AND WASTED HIS ESTATE BUT NOT OF ONE WHO BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE DEMANDED OF HER THAT SUBMISSION WHICH
TO HIS BREAST POCKET AND KNEW THAT THE FIFTY POUNDS WAS THERE BUT HE KNEW ALSO THAT IT WOULD SOON BE GONE EVEN TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE EXPEDIENT TO GET UP AND AT ONCE TO GO WHAT DELIGHT WOULD THERE BE
LATER ON IN THE EVENING MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH BEGAN AGAIN
I DO NOT KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT HARRY AT THIS MOMENT LOOKED UP AND CAUGHT THE EYE OF MISSUS MOUNTJOY AS SHE WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY OPPOSITE
THIS WAS A LONG GLOOMY ROOM WHICH CONTAINED PERHAPS TEN THOUSAND VOLUMES
HER VOICE WAS SOFT AND LOW AND SWEET
WELL GIRLS WHAT IS YOUR NEWS WE WERE OUT TO DAY ON THE BROMPTON ROAD SAID THE ELDEST AND THERE CAME UP PRINCE CHITAKOV'S DRAG WITH FOUR ROANS PRINCE CHITAKOV I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A PRINCE
YOU HAVE HEARD OF A YOUNG LADY NAMED MISS MOUNTJOY A COUSIN OF OURS MOUNTJOY'S MISS MOUNTJOY SUGGESTED JONES YES MOUNTJOY'S MISS MOUNTJOY THAT OF COURSE IS OVER
SHE KNEW THAT HE ADORED HER BUT YET HE DID NOT HASTEN TO TELL HER SO SHE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM BUT SHE DOUBTED WHETHER A TIME WOULD EVER COME IN WHICH SHE COULD CONFESS IT IT WAS NOT
TO A GIRL WHEN IT IS PROPOSED TO HER SUDDENLY TO CHANGE EVERYTHING IN LIFE TO GO ALTOGETHER AWAY AND PLACE HERSELF UNDER THE CUSTODY OF A NEW MASTER TO FIND FOR HERSELF A NEW HOME NEW PURSUITS
AND WHEN TO HOLD YOUR HAND IF YOU TELL ME ABOUT MISTAKES I SHALL MAKE IT PERSONAL I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SCARBOROUGH THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN UP IN THAT WAY HANG YOUR SCARBOROUGH
AND NOW IF I HAVE THIS MONEY IT WILL GIVE ME THE MEANS OF DOING SO YOU OUGHT TO KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE I SHALL USE IT THAT IS ALL SETTLED SAID THE FATHER THE DOCUMENT PROPERLY COMPLETED HAS GONE BACK WITH THE CLERK
BUT SHE FELT IT AND WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT TIDINGS OF HIS DEBTS AT LAST REACHED HER SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS GLAD OF AN EXCUSE THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT THE EXCUSE WOULD NOT HAVE PREVAILED WITH HER HAD SHE LIKED HIM THEN CAME HIS DEBTS
BUT IN THESE DAYS SHE HAD LOVED NO MAN AND WAS INCLINED TO THINK SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AS TO MAKE HER WANT OF LOVE NO NECESSARY BAR TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE WISH OF OTHERS BY DEGREES
AND IN A SHORT TIME WAS SITTING AT DINNER WITH MERTON THE YOUNG DOCTOR AND SECRETARY MISS SCARBOROUGH SELDOM CAME TO TABLE AT THAT HOUR BUT REMAINED IN A ROOM UP STAIRS CLOSE TO HER BROTHER
WITH THE WICKED SKILL OF HER BROTHER WHICH EVEN IN THAT CASE MIGHT MAKE CROOKED THINGS SMOOTH AUGUSTUS WHOM SHE HAD REGARDED ALWAYS AS QUITE A MOUNTJOY BECAUSE OF HIS TALENT AND APPEARANCE AND HABIT OF COMMAND HAD WHISPERED TO HER A WORD
NOT WHEN YOU COME TO PLAY WITH MEN WHO KNOW WHAT PLAY IS LOOK AT GROSSENGRANNEL I'D SOONER BET ON HIM THAN ANY MAN IN LONDON GROSSENGRANNEL NEVER FORGETS A CARD I'LL BET A HUNDRED POUNDS THAT HE KNOWS THE BEST CARD
OF THE HUE MOST COMMON TO MEN AND WOMEN AND HAD IN THEM NOTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR BUT HER HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND EVER WELL DRESSED AND NEVER REDOLENT OF PECULIAR ODORS IT WAS SIMPLY FLORENCE MOUNTJOY'S HAIR
YOU'VE TURNED UP AN HONOR ALREADY WHEN A MAN BEGINS WITH AN HONOR HE'LL ALWAYS GO ON WITH HONORS THAT'S MY OBSERVATION I KNOW YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS GAME MOODY SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO ARRANGE THE PLAY AND WILL FOLLOW UP AS WELL AS I CAN
THINGS WHICH I USED TO FANCY THOUGH I HAVE NOT CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THEM LATELY
SAYING THAT THERE WERE SCARBOROUGH PAPERS WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD READ BEFORE HE STARTED FOR TRETTON ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
HIS MARRIAGE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE AND THE NEXT FATAL YEAR HAD FALLEN UPON HIM AS LONG AS THE INHERITANCE OF THE ESTATE WAS CERTAINLY HIS HE COULD ASSUREDLY RAISE MONEY AT A CERTAIN COST
AND HAD TO DAY HEARD A STORY VERY MUCH AS SHE THOUGHT TO HIS DISCREDIT IS YOUR DAUGHTER HERE ASKED HARRY WITH WELL TRAINED HYPOCRISY MISSUS MOUNTJOY COULD NOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FLORENCE WAS IN THE ROOM AND THEN HARRY PASSED ON IN PURSUIT OF HIS QUARRY
HARRY SAW HER AS HE GOT FLORENCE TO AN OPPOSITE DOOR AND THERE FOR THE MOMENT ESCAPED WITH HER AND NOW HE SAID HOW AM I TO MANAGE TO SEE YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO BRUSSELS
ABOUT YOUR WILL NO NOT ABOUT MY WILL AT ALL THAT SHALL REMAIN AS IT IS I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE STRENGTH TO MAKE ANOTHER WILL NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO YOU MEAN ABOUT MERTON I DON'T MEAN ABOUT MERTON AT ALL GIVE HIM FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND HE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED
BUT AFTERWARD WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING WHY IT WAS THAT HARRY HAD BEEN SO RETICENT THEN HE HAD ALLURED HARRY ON TO A DIRECT LIE AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT HE COULD AFTERWARD USE THE SECRET FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE
THEN HE SMASHED DOWN HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND LEFT THE ROOM
THE MAJOR PERTINACIOUSLY REFUSED TO INCREASE HIS STAKES AND WORSE AGAIN REFUSED TO PLAY FOR ANYTHING BUT READY MONEY IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO YOU MAY THINK ME VERY ODD BUT IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO
I'M HOST HERE AND OF COURSE WILL GIVE WAY TO ANYTHING YOU MAY PROPOSE WHAT'S IT TO BE SCARBOROUGH POUNDS AND FIVES I SHAN'T PLAY HIGHER THAN THAT
AND SHE HAD MANAGED IT IS SHE COMING HARRY SAID TO MISSUS ARMITAGE IN AN ANXIOUS WHISPER AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE HAS BEEN HERE THIS HALF HOUR
SO THERE CAME UPON HIS ARM THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE SENSE OF PRESSURE FROM THOSE SWEET FINGERS
WELL YES I SUPPOSE SO A MAN HAS GOT SO MANY THINGS TO LOOK AFTER WHICH HE CAN'T ATTEND TO DOWN HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT MARRY HER COUSIN IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE QUESTIONS HAD BEEN ASKED BEFORE ANY OF THE TERRIBLE FACTS OF CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH'S LIFE HAD BEEN MADE KNOWN TO HER BECAUSE IT MAY BE SAID SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM
WHICH ON THE MORNING WOULD BE HONORED AND AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN CAREER HIS READY MONEY PAYMENTS HIS OBEDIENCE TO CERTAIN RULES OF THE GAME RULES I MEAN AGAINST CHEATING
AND THE RESULT IS THERE ONLY TOO EVIDENT BUT FLORENCE SEEMED TO HAVE STUDIED NOTHING THE BEHOLDER FELT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AS GRACEFUL WHEN PLAYING WITH HER DOLL IN THE NURSERY AND IT WAS THE SAME WITH HER BEAUTY
SHE WHISPERED BUT I WANT TO HEAR IT OH FLORENCE FLORENCE I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLETELY I AM BEYOND MYSELF WITH JOY I CANNOT DANCE AGAIN AND WILL NOT OH MY WIFE MY WIFE HUSH SAID FLORENCE
ON THE NEXT MORNING SEPTIMUS JONES TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING AUGUSTUS FOLLOWED HIM
FLORENCE HAD SEEN HER MOTHER'S EYE FIXED UPON HER OH COME THAT WON'T DO AT ALL SAID HARRY WHO HAD ALREADY GOT HER HAND WITHIN HIS ARM A FELLOW IS ALWAYS ENTITLED TO FIVE MINUTES AND THEN I AM DOWN FOR THE NEXT WALTZ OH NO BUT I AM AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT NOW
SHE NEVER DEMANDED IMMEDIATE HOMAGE BY THE SUDDEN FLASH OF HER BEAUTY BUT WHEN HER SPELL HAD ONCE FALLEN ON A MAN'S SPIRIT IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE COULD ESCAPE FROM IT QUICKLY WHEN SHE SPOKE A PECULIAR MELODY STRUCK THE HEARER'S EARS
THAT HE HAD A WIFE AT HOME WHOM HE KEPT IN MODERATE COMFORT ON HIS WINNINGS IT SEEMED TO BE THE SOLE DESIRE OF HIS HEART TO PLAY WITH RECKLESS FOOLISH YOUNG MEN WHO UP TO A CERTAIN POINT DID NOT CARE WHAT THEY LOST
AS SHE THOUGHT SHOULD BE GIVEN BY HER FREELY AFTER HER MARRIAGE
WILL HE LIVE OR WILL HE DIE HE WILL DIE CERTAINLY DO NOT JOKE WITH ME BUT I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT JOKE ON SUCH A SUBJECT AND MY QUESTION DID NOT MERELY GO TO THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM AS A MAN GENERALLY
I DO BELIEVE THAT AT WHIST EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON THE CARDS OR ELSE ON THE HINGES I'VE KNOWN ELEVEN RUBBERS RUNNING TO FOLLOW THE HINGES PEOPLE LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN LUCK I SPEAK AS I FIND IT THAT'S ALL
HE MIGHT STILL LEARN TO SING THAT SONG OF THE OLD FASHIONED POET AS TO THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
OH NO NOT IN THE LEAST IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO LAUGH MISSUS ARMITAGE BUT AS I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT ALL I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN DESPAIR BUT NOW YOU ARE NOT IN DESPAIR NO INDEED JUST NOW I AM TRIUMPHANT
THAT'LL BE HARD ON SCARBOROUGH I'LL GO ON FOR MONEY SAID THE IMMOVABLE MAJOR I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T HAVE IT OUT WITH ME AT DOUBLE DUMMY SAID VIGNOLLES TO HIS VICTIM BUT DOUBLE DUMMY IS A TERRIBLE GRIND AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT
AND HARRY'S NAME WAS DULY INSCRIBED THE NEXT DANCE WAS A QUADRILLE
IN EVERY SUIT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY'S PLAY THAT'S HIS SECRET HE GIVES HIS MIND TO IT WHICH I CAN'T HANG IT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT OF WHAT I'M GOING TO EAT
NO I SHOULD NOT MY DEAR AND HIS OWN INCOME IS ALL GIVEN UP TO THE HOUSE USES HERE SOPHY TOUCHED IMPRUDENTLY ON A SORE SUBJECT HIS OWN INCOME CONSISTED OF WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED OUT OF HIS WIFE'S FORTUNE
BUT NOWADAYS I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND VERY SELDOM THINK ABOUT THE WINGED HORSE AT ALL IF I EVER SAW THE CREATURE IT WAS A LONG LONG WHILE AGO AND
AND THE HARDEST TO FIGHT WITH AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO RUN AWAY FROM THAT EVER CAME OUT OF THE EARTH'S INSIDE IT HAD A TAIL LIKE A BOA CONSTRICTOR
AND AS SWIFT AND AS BUOYANT IN HIS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR AS ANY EAGLE THAT EVER SOARED INTO THE CLOUDS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LIKE HIM IN THE WORLD HE HAD NO MATE HE NEVER HAD BEEN BACKED OR BRIDLED BY A MASTER
WHO WAS DIPPING UP SOME OF THE WATER IN A PITCHER HE PAUSED AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT REFRESH HIMSELF WITH A DRAUGHT THIS IS VERY DELICIOUS WATER HE SAID TO THE MAIDEN AS HE RINSED AND FILLED HER PITCHER
TO BE SURE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE DENIED THAT THERE WAS ANY SUCH HORSE WITH WINGS AND SAID THAT THE STORIES ABOUT HIM WERE ALL POETRY AND NONSENSE BUT WONDERFUL AS IT APPEARED
TWO OR THREE TIMES ALREADY SHE HAD STOOPED OVER THE BOX AND TAKEN THE KNOT BETWEEN HER THUMB AND FOREFINGER BUT WITHOUT POSITIVELY TRYING TO UNDO IT
HAIL TO THE NOBLE ARGONAUTS WHO SAILED THE UNKNOWN SEAL THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD THEIR JOURNEY OVER THE SLUGGISH NORTHERN MAIN AND THROUGH THE SHORELESS OUTER OCEAN TO THE FAIRY ISLAND OF THE WEST
AND THE LIQUID FIRE RAN FROM HIS HEEL LIKE A STREAM OF LAVA TO THE SEA AND MEDEIA LAUGHED AND CALLED TO THE HEROES COME ASHORE AND WATER YOUR SHIP IN PEACE SO THEY CAME AND FOUND THE GIANT LYING DEAD
THEN MEDEIA HELD UP A FLASK OF CRYSTAL AND SAID HERE IS THE ICHOR OF YOUTH I AM MEDEIA THE ENCHANTRESS
AND FELL AT HER KNEES AND CLASPED THEM AND CRIED WEEPING AS SHE KNELT I AM YOUR GUEST FAIR QUEEN
MY GRANDMOTHER HAS TOLD ME THAT THIS CLEAR FOUNTAIN WAS ONCE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND WHEN HER SON WAS KILLED BY THE ARROWS OF THE HUNTRESS DIANA SHE MELTED ALL AWAY INTO TEARS AND SO THE WATER
AND WITHIN AGAINST THE WALLS STOOD THRONES ON EITHER SIDE DOWN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HALL STREWN WITH RICH GLOSSY SHAWLS AND ON THEM THE MERCHANT KINGS OF THOSE CRAFTY SEA ROVING PHAEACES SAT EATING AND DRINKING IN PRIDE
THEN ALL THE HEROES WEPT ALOUD WHEN THEY HEARD THE SENTENCE OF THE OAK FOR THEY KNEW THAT A DARK JOURNEY LAY BEFORE THEM AND YEARS OF BITTER TOIL AND SOME UPBRAIDED THE DARK WITCH WOMAN AND SOME SAID
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE LONELY ANOTHER CHILD FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS LIKE HIMSELF WAS SENT FROM A FAR COUNTRY TO LIVE WITH HIM AND BE HIS PLAYFELLOW AND HELPMATE HER NAME WAS PANDORA
THE BOX THE BOX AND NOTHING BUT THE BOX IT SEEMED AS IF THE BOX WERE BEWITCHED AND AS IF THE COTTAGE WERE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT WITHOUT PANDORA'S CONTINUALLY STUMBLING OVER IT AND MAKING EPIMETHEUS STUMBLE OVER IT LIKEWISE AND BRUISING ALL FOUR OF THEIR SHINS
WHERE A FEW WILD GOATHERDS DWELL BUT WHENCE COME THESE NEW HARBOURS AND VAST WORKS OF POLISHED STONE BUT JASON SAID THEY CAN BE NO SAVAGE PEOPLE WE WILL GO IN AND TAKE OUR CHANCE
PEGASUS MIGHT HAVE MADE THOSE HOOF MARKS AND SO MIGHT SOME OTHER HORSE AND HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN HIM MY FAIR MAIDEN ASKED BELLEROPHON OF THE GIRL
OH THE MOST CURIOUS STAFF YOU EVER SAW CRIED EPIMETHEUS IT WAS LIKE TWO SERPENTS TWISTING AROUND A STICK AND WAS CARVED SO NATURALLY THAT I AT FIRST THOUGHT THE SERPENTS WERE ALIVE I KNOW HIM SAID PANDORA THOUGHTFULLY
TILL THEY WADDLE IN THEIR WALK LIKE DUCKS AT THAT IDAS THE RASH WOULD HAVE STRUCK THEM BUT JASON HELD HIM BACK TILL ONE OF THE MERCHANT KINGS SPOKE TO THEM A TALL AND STATELY MAN DO NOT BE ANGRY STRANGERS
AND SAW SICILY THE THREE CORNERED ISLAND UNDER WHICH ENCELADUS THE GIANT LIES GROANING DAY AND NIGHT AND WHEN HE TURNS THE EARTH QUAKES AND HIS BREATH BURSTS OUT IN ROARING FLAMES FROM THE HIGHEST CONE OF A ETNA
AS LONG AS THEY WERE YOUTHFUL AND RETAINED THEIR FAITH IN WINGED HORSES IN HOPES OF GETTING A GLIMPSE AT THE BEAUTIFUL PEGASUS BUT OF LATE YEARS HE HAD BEEN VERY SELDOM SEEN
BUT THE SHIPS CAME NEARER EVERY HOUR THEN MEDEIA THE DARK WITCH MAIDEN
WHISKING HIM UP ABOVE THE CLOUDS WHEN HE ONLY WANTED TO RIDE TO MILL NO NO I DON'T BELIEVE IN PEGASUS
THEN THEY CAME BACK AGAIN INTO THE HALL WHILE THE MERCHANT KINGS ROSE UP TO DO THEM HONOUR AND EACH MAN SAID TO HIS NEIGHBOUR NO WONDER THAT THESE MEN WON FAME HOW THEY STAND NOW LIKE GIANTS OR TITANS OR IMMORTALS COME DOWN FROM OLYMPUS
I WISH HE WOULD COME DOWN AND TAKE ME ON HIS BACK AND LET ME RIDE HIM UP TO THE MOON BUT IF I SO MUCH AS STIR TO LOOK AT HIM HE FLIES FAR AWAY OUT OF SIGHT AND BELLEROPHON PUT HIS FAITH IN THE CHILD
HORRIBLE THINGS IT SO CHANCED THAT BELLEROPHON CAME TO THAT PART OF THE WORLD ON A VISIT TO THE KING
AND SHOWED HER THE SECRET NAIL AND SHE DREW THE NAIL OUT GENTLY BUT SHE POURED NO ICHOR IN AND INSTEAD THE LIQUID FIRE SPOUTED FORTH LIKE A STREAM OF RED HOT IRON AND TALUS TRIED TO LEAP UP CRYING
BETTER SO THAN TO WANDER FOREVER DISGRACED BY THE GUILT OF MY PRINCES FOR THE BLOOD OF ABSYRTUS STILL TRACKS ME AND WOE FOLLOWS HARD UPON WOE AND NOW SOME DARK HORROR WILL CLUTCH ME
AND HIS MUSIC AND HIS VOICE ROSE LIKE A TRUMPET THROUGH THE STILL EVENING AIR INTO THE AIR IT RUSHED LIKE THUNDER TILL THE ROCKS RANG AND THE SEA AND INTO THEIR SOULS IT RUSHED LIKE WINE TILL ALL HEARTS BEAT FAST WITHIN THEIR BREASTS
AND ARRANGING THEM IN VASES AND POOR LITTLE PANDORA'S DAY'S WORK WAS OVER AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THERE WAS THE BOX AFTER ALL I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT THE BOX WAS NOT A BLESSING TO HER IN ITS WAY
HE HAD BEEN SEEN NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE DRINKING THE DELICIOUS WATER OR ROLLING HIMSELF UPON THE SOFT GRASS OF THE MARGIN SOMETIMES TOO BUT PEGASUS WAS VERY DAINTY IN HIS FOOD
BY A STONE WHICH A HERDSMAN THREW AND THERE TOO MOPSUS DIED THE SEER WHO KNEW THE VOICES OF ALL BIRDS BUT HE COULD NOT FORETELL HIS OWN END FOR HE WAS BITTEN IN THE FOOT BY A SNAKE
CRIPPLED AND BLIND LIKEWISE AND THE TWO OLD MEN'S HEADS SHOOK TOGETHER AS THEY TRIED TO WARM THEMSELVES BEFORE THE FIRE AND JASON FELL DOWN AT HIS FATHER'S KNEES AND WEPT AND CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME
THE RICH SEA GOING KING AND WE WILL FEAST YOU WELL AND HEARTILY AND AFTER THAT YOU SHALL TELL US YOUR NAME BUT MEDEIA HUNG BACK AND TREMBLED AND WHISPERED IN JASON'S EAR WE ARE BETRAYED
SING LOUDER ORPHEUS SING A BOLDER STRAIN WAKE UP THESE HAPLESS SLUGGARDS OR NONE OF THEM WILL SEE THE LAND OF HELLAS MORE THEN ORPHEUS LIFTED HIS HARP AND CRASHED HIS CUNNING HAND ACROSS THE STRINGS
AS WISE PEOPLE HAVE INFORMED ME MUST BE FOUND HEREABOUTS IF ANYWHERE DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE WINGED HORSE PEGASUS STILL HAUNTS THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE AS HE USED TO DO IN YOUR FOREFATHERS DAYS
NO GUEST OF OURS SHALL FIGHT UPON OUR ISLAND AND IF YOU GO OUTSIDE THEY WILL OUTNUMBER YOU I WILL DO JUSTICE BETWEEN YOU FOR I KNOW AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT THEN HE TURNED TO HIS KINGS AND SAID
FOR THEY SAY THAT HE HAS BUT ONE VEIN IN ALL HIS BODY FILLED WITH LIQUID FIRE AND THAT THIS VEIN IS CLOSED WITH A NAIL BUT I KNOW NOT WHERE THAT NAIL IS PLACED BUT IF I CAN GET IT ONCE INTO THESE HANDS
BUT EVERY DAY IT GREW MORE AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL UNTIL BEFORE A GREAT WHILE THE COTTAGE OF EPIMETHEUS AND PANDORA WAS LESS SUNSHINY THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN
WHERE THE TITAN SWAM ACROSS UPON THE BULL AND THENCE INTO THE LAZY WATERS OF THE STILL MAEOTID LAKE
IT SUPPLIED HER WITH SUCH A VARIETY OF IDEAS TO THINK OF AND TO TALK ABOUT WHENEVER SHE HAD ANYBODY TO LISTEN
NOW YOU WILL PERHAPS WISH TO BE TOLD WHY IT WAS THAT BELLEROPHON HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CATCH THE WINGED HORSE AND WE SHALL FIND NO BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS MATTER THAN WHILE HE IS WAITING FOR PEGASUS TO APPEAR
OH SUCH A BRISK AND MELODIOUS NEIGH AS THAT WAS MY VERY HEART LEAPED WITH DELIGHT AT THE SOUND BUT IT STARTLED ME NEVERTHELESS
BUT IF WE RETURN WITHOUT HER WE MUST DIE THE DEATH SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS JASON THE A EOLID SAID ALCINOUS TURNING TO THE MINUAI I SAY SAID THE CUNNING JASON
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A BRIDLE STUDDED WITH BRILLIANT GEMS AND ADORNED WITH A GOLDEN BIT SEEING AN OLD MAN AND ANOTHER OF MIDDLE AGE AND A LITTLE BOY NEAR THE FOUNTAIN AND LIKEWISE A MAIDEN
IT WAS LEFT AT THE DOOR REPLIED EPIMETHEUS JUST BEFORE YOU CAME BY A PERSON WHO LOOKED VERY SMILING AND INTELLIGENT AND WHO COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING AS HE PUT IT DOWN
EITHER WITH THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY OR WITH WICKED GIANTS OR WITH TROUBLESOME DRAGONS OR WITH WILD BEASTS
AND A PLAGUE SHE WILL BE TO YOU TAKE HER SINCE YOU ARE NO WISER AND WE WILL SAIL AWAY TOWARD THE NORTH THEN ALCINOUS GAVE THEM FOOD AND WATER AND GARMENTS AND RICH PRESENTS OF ALL SORTS
AND KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE SIRENS AND CRIED SING ON SING ON BUT HE COULD SAY NO MORE FOR A CHARMED SLEEP CAME OVER HIM AND A PLEASANT HUMMING IN HIS EARS
AND THESE VARIOUS OBJECTS WERE SO EXQUISITELY REPRESENTED AND WERE WROUGHT TOGETHER IN SUCH HARMONY THAT FLOWERS FOLIAGE AND HUMAN BEINGS SEEMED TO COMBINE INTO A WREATH OF MINGLED BEAUTY BUT HERE AND THERE PEEPING FORTH FROM BEHIND THE CARVED FOLIAGE
TO HURL HER INTO THE SEA AND ATONE FOR THE YOUNG BOY'S DEATH BUT THE MAGIC BOUGH SPOKE AGAIN LET HER LIVE TILL HER CRIMES ARE FULL VENGEANCE WAITS FOR HER SLOW AND SURE BUT SHE MUST LIVE FOR YOU NEED HER STILL
AND LYNCEUS THE QUICK EYED SAW HIM COMING WHILE HE WAS STILL MANY A MILE AWAY AND CRIED I SEE A HUNDRED SHIPS LIKE A FLOCK OF WHITE SWANS FAR IN THE EAST AND AT THAT THEY ROWED HARD LIKE HEROES
AND DIED IN PEACE AND NOW HIS SON ALCINOUS RULES US
OH HOW FINE A THING IT IS TO BE A WINGED HORSE SLEEPING AT NIGHT
WHILE SILVER SHOALS OF FISH CAME UP TO HEARKEN AND WHISPERED AS THEY BROKE THE SHINING CALM THE WIND OVERHEAD HUSHED HIS WHISTLING AS HE SHEPHERDED HIS CLOUDS TOWARD THE WEST AND THE CLOUDS STOOD IN MID BLUE
I THINK WE SHALL SEE PEGASUS TO DAY AND AT LENGTH IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LITTLE BOY'S UNWAVERING FAITH
PANDORA ONCE OR TWICE FANCIED THAT SHE SAW A FACE NOT SO LOVELY OR SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT WAS DISAGREEABLE AND WHICH STOLE THE BEAUTY OUT OF ALL THE REST NEVERTHELESS ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND TOUCHING THE SPOT WITH HER FINGER
WE HOLD OURS TO BE THE BEST ON EARTH SUCH DANCING WE HAVE NEVER SEEN SAID ORPHEUS AND YOUR SINGER IS A HAPPY MAN FOR PHOEBUS HIMSELF MUST HAVE TAUGHT HIM OR ELSE HE IS THE SON OF A MUSE
AND THAT SKIMMING A LITTLE TOO LOW HE HAD GOT ASTRAY AMONG OUR MISTS AND VAPOURS AND WAS SEEKING HIS WAY BACK AGAIN IT WAS VERY PRETTY TO BEHOLD HIM PLUNGE INTO THE FLEECY BOSOM OF A BRIGHT CLOUD
TILL THEY CAME TO THE PILLARS OF HERCULES AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THENCE THEY SAILED ON THROUGH THE DEEPS OF SARDINIA AND PAST THE AUSONIAN ISLANDS
NOBODY ELSE HAS SUCH A STAFF IT WAS QUICKSILVER AND HE BROUGHT ME HITHER AS WELL AS THE BOX NO DOUBT HE INTENDED IT FOR ME AND MOST PROBABLY IT CONTAINS PRETTY DRESSES FOR ME TO WEAR OR TOYS FOR YOU AND ME TO PLAY WITH
EVERY MORNING THE CHILD GAVE HIM A NEW HOPE TO PUT IN HIS BOSOM INSTEAD OF YESTERDAY'S WITHERED ONE DEAR BELLEROPHON HE WOULD CRY LOOKING UP HOPEFULLY INTO HIS FACE
UNLESS YOU WILL CLING TO THE LAND AND SAIL SOUTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD FOREVER I SHALL WANDER BEYOND THE ATLANTIC TO THE OCEAN WHICH HAS NO SHORE THEN THEY BLEST THE MAGIC BOUGH AND SAILED SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LAND
LOOKING UPWARD AT THE SKY OR ELSE DOWN INTO THE WATER HOPING FOREVER THAT HE SHOULD SEE EITHER THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE WINGED HORSE OR THE MARVELLOUS REALITY HE HELD THE BRIDLE
AFTER ALL SHE IS OUR GUEST AND MY SUPPLIANT AND PRAYERS ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZEUS AND WHO TOO DARE PART MAN AND WIFE AFTER ALL THEY HAVE ENDURED TOGETHER AND ALCINOUS SMILED
AND ALL THE WONDERS THEY HAD SEEN TILL MIDNIGHT PASSED AND THE DAY DAWNED BUT THE KINGS NEVER THOUGHT OF SLEEP EACH MAN SAT STILL AND LISTENED WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND AND AT LAST WHEN ORPHEUS HAD ENDED
AT THE SOUTHWEST POINT OF THE PELOPONNESE AND THERE THEY OFFERED SACRIFICES AND ORPHEUS PURGED THEM FROM THEIR GUILT THEN THEY ROWED AWAY AGAIN TO THE NORTHWARD PAST THE LACONIAN SHORE AND CAME ALL WORN AND TIRED BY SUNIUM
AND SLOWLY THEY CREPT DOWN TOWARD HIM LIKE LEOPARDS WHO CREEP UPON THEIR PREY AND THEIR HANDS WERE LIKE THE TALONS OF EAGLES AS THEY STEPT ACROSS THE BONES OF THEIR VICTIMS TO ENJOY THEIR CRUEL FEAST
AND WE HAVE LOST OUR TWO SWIFT COMRADES THE SONS OF THE NORTH WIND BUT DO NOT THINK US COWARDS IF YOU WISH TO TRY OUR STRENGTH WE WILL SHOOT AND BOX AND WRESTLE AGAINST ANY MEN ON EARTH AND ALCINOUS SMILED AND ANSWERED
HE WAS AFRAID LEST KING IOBATES SHOULD IMAGINE THAT HE HAD FLED FROM THE CHIMAERA IT PAINED HIM TOO TO THINK HOW MUCH MISCHIEF THE MONSTER WAS DOING WHILE HE HIMSELF
MY MOTHER WARNED ME OF HER ERE WE SAILED AWAY FROM HELLAS SHE HAS SIX HEADS AND SIX LONG NECKS AND HIDES IN THAT DARK CLEFT AND FROM HER CAVE SHE FISHES FOR ALL THINGS WHICH PASS BY FOR SHARKS AND SEALS AND DOLPHINS
AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE CAME TOWARD THEM MORE SWIFTLY THAN THE SWIFTEST HORSE LEAPING ACROSS THE GLENS AT A BOUND AND STRIDING AT ONE STEP FROM DOWN TO DOWN AND WHEN HE CAME ABREAST OF THEM
OR AT EVENTIDE HE SAW THE TENDER BUD OF TO MORROW'S BREAKFAST IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT LIFE INDEED NO LABOUR TO BE DONE NO TASKS TO BE STUDIED
HE WOULD CROP A FEW OF THE CLOVER BLOSSOMS THAT HAPPENED TO BE SWEETEST TO THE FOUNTAIN OF PIRENE THEREFORE PEOPLE'S GREAT GRANDFATHERS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF GOING
AND COOK THEM AFTERWARD IN THE BURNING OVEN OF ITS STOMACH MERCY ON US LITTLE CHILDREN I HOPE NEITHER YOU NOR I WILL EVER HAPPEN TO MEET A CHIMAERA WHILE THE HATEFUL BEAST
AS I AM ALSO AND HAVE SUNG ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH NOT SO WELL AS HE SING TO US THEN NOBLE STRANGER SAID ALCINOUS AND WE WILL GIVE YOU PRECIOUS GIFTS
THEN TELL ME HEROES ASKED ALCINOUS YOU WHO HAVE SAILED THE OCEAN ROUND AND SEEN THE MANNERS OF ALL NATIONS HAVE YOU SEEN SUCH DANCERS AS OURS HERE OR HEARD SUCH MUSIC AND SUCH SINGING
WHICH YOU FIND SO COOL AND SWEET IS THE SORROW OF THAT POOR MOTHER'S HEART I SHOULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OBSERVED THE YOUNG STRANGER THAT SO CLEAR A WELL SPRING WITH ITS GUSH AND GURGLE
IMMORTAL WITH HIS IMMORTAL BRIDE AND HONOURED BY ALL MEN BELOW SO ORPHEUS SANG AND THE SIRENS ANSWERING EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GOLDEN SEA TILL ORPHEUS'S VOICE DROWNED THE SIRENS
IT WAS EITHER PEGASUS OR A LARGE WHITE BIRD A VERY GREAT WAY UP IN THE AIR AND ONE OTHER TIME AS I WAS COMING TO THE FOUNTAIN WITH MY PITCHER I HEARD A NEIGH
NEVER WAS A KNOT SO CUNNINGLY TWISTED NOR WITH SO MANY INS AND OUTS WHICH ROGUISHLY DEFIED THE SKILFULLEST FINGERS TO DISENTANGLE THEM AND YET BY THE VERY DIFFICULTY THAT THERE WAS IN IT PANDORA WAS THE MORE TEMPTED TO EXAMINE THE KNOT
AND THE SACRED SHIP IS FOUL WITH BLOOD AT THAT SOME OF THE HEROES CRIED MEDEIA IS THE MURDERESS LET THE WITCH WOMAN BEAR HER SIN AND DIE AND THEY SEIZED MEDEIA
AND THE MASTERS OF THE SEA AND WE ARE BUT POOR WANDERING MARINERS WORN OUT WITH THIRST AND TOIL GIVE US BUT FOOD AND WATER AND WE WILL GO ON OUR VOYAGE IN PEACE THEN THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND ANSWERED
WITH ITS FLAMING BREATH IT COULD SET A FOREST ON FIRE OR BURN UP A FIELD OF GRAIN OR FOR THAT MATTER A VILLAGE WITH ALL ITS FENCES AND HOUSES
DO NOT BE AFRAID PANDORA WHAT HARM CAN THERE BE IN OPENING THE BOX
IF THE HORSE WAS AS FINE AS THE BRIDLE YOU ARE MUCH TO BE PITIED FOR LOSING HIM I HAVE LOST NO HORSE SAID BELLEROPHON WITH A SMILE BUT I HAPPEN TO BE SEEKING A VERY FAMOUS ONE WHICH
WHO HAD SEEN THE IMAGE OF PEGASUS IN THE WATER AND IN THE MAIDEN WHO HAD HEARD HIM NEIGH SO MELODIOUSLY RATHER THAN IN THE MIDDLE AGED CLOWN WHO BELIEVED ONLY IN CART HORSES
AND LYCIA WAS THE COUNTRY WHICH HE RULED OVER BELLEROPHON WAS ONE OF THE BRAVEST YOUTHS IN THE WORLD AND DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO DO SOME VALIANT AND BENEFICENT DEED
EACH ONE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER FROM GIANTS TWO MILES HIGH DOWN TO THE TINIEST DWARF NO BIGGER THAN MY LITTLE FINGER SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY PRINCES AND DUKES HER HUSBAND STOOD STILL AND SAID
I WOULD REGRET TO LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT POSSESSING SOME OF IT BUT NO ONE HAS DARED TO BRAVE THE TWO DRAGONS THAT GUARD THE CAVERN WHERE THE FOUNTAIN IS TO BE FOUND YOU DO NOT NEED THE WATER PRINCESS BUT MY LIFE IS YOURS TO COMMAND
THE BIGGEST AS THICK AS A TOWER DOWN TO THE TINIEST LITTLE TAPER KINGS AND EMPERORS WERE ON THEIR KNEES BEFORE HER KISSING HER SHOE WIFE SAID THE MAN LOOKING AT HER ART THOU NOW POPE
AH SAID HANS QUITE ALOUD WHAT A CAPITAL THING IT IS TO RIDE THERE YOU SIT AS COMFORTABLY AS IN A CHAIR KICKING AGAINST NO STONES SAVING YOUR SHOE LEATHER AND GETTING TO YOUR JOURNEY'S END ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THEN OFF RAN THE DOG BACK TO THE COPPER PALACE WITH THE PRINCESS I HAD SUCH A STRANGE DREAM LAST NIGHT THE PRINCESS TOLD THE KING AND QUEEN AT BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING
AND COULDN'T MANAGE IT AND THE GENTLEMAN WONDERED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING IT FOR AT LAST HE STOPPED AND WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF OH DEAR HE SAYS I DO THINK TROUSERS ARE THE MOST AWKWARDEST
AND A FINE CROP OF GRASS WAS GROWING THERE NOW THEIR HOUSE LAY CLOSE UP AGAINST A STEEP DOWN AND HE THOUGHT IF HE LAID A PLANK ACROSS TO THE THATCH AT THE BACK HE'D EASILY GET THE COW UP
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY DONE WELL FOR YOURSELF EACH TIME SAID THE SCISSORS GRINDER IF YOU COULD ONLY HEAR MONEY RATTLING IN YOUR POCKET EVERY TIME YOU GOT UP YOUR FORTUNE WOULD BE MADE HOW SHALL I SET ABOUT IT SAID HANS
WHEN SHE CROSSED THE LAST MEADOW FROM THE MILL
SAID THE CRUEL QUEEN IF YOU SHOW HER THIS TOKEN ON WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN WHAT I WANT DONE
AT LENGTH THE WHITE CAT REMINDED HIM THAT IN THREE DAYS HE MUST APPEAR AT COURT AND THE PRINCE WAS TERRIBLY UPSET TO THINK THAT HE HAD NOW NO CHANCE OF WINNING HIS FATHER'S KINGDOM BUT THE WHITE CAT TOLD HIM THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL AND GIVING HIM AN ACORN
WHY NOT SAID THE WOMAN GO THOU MUST I WILL BE KING SO THE MAN WENT BUT HE WAS QUITE SAD BECAUSE HIS WIFE WOULD BE KING IT IS NOT RIGHT HE SAID
AT ANY RATE HE THOUGHT I SHALL HAVE THREE MONTHS MORE OF LIFE THEN THE BEAST SAID I WILL NOT LET YOU GO EMPTY HANDED SO THE MERCHANT FOLLOWED HIM BACK INTO THE PALACE THERE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL LAY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL CHEST OF WROUGHT SILVER
THE SEVEN QUEENS SENT HIM A MESSAGE SAYING MAY IT PLEASE OUR DEAREST LORD
HE TOOK THE IMMENSE ANIMAL IN HIS ARMS SET HIM ON THE WITCH'S APRON
ONCE WHILE TRAVELING THROUGH HIS TERRITORIES HE CAME TO A WELL THAT WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH CLEAR COLD WATER AND BEING VERY THIRSTY HE STOPPED TO DRINK ON THE TOP OF THE WATER FLOATED A GOLDEN VESSEL WHICH THE KING ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE
MORNING CAME THROUGH THE NARROW BARS OF HIS LITTLE WINDOW THE SOLDIER COULD SEE THE PEOPLE ALL HURRYING OUT OF TOWN THEY WERE GOING TO SEE HIM HANGED HE HEARD THE DRUMS
AND TAKE A SHARE IN THE MUSIC I WILL PLAY ON THE LUTE AND YOU SHALL BEAT THE KETTLEDRUMS THE DOG WAS SATISFIED AND OFF THEY SET PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A CAT
BUT BEFORE HE COULD WIELD HIS CLUB A RAVEN LIT ON HIS HEAD AND PECKED AT HIS EYES SO THAT HE DROPPED HIS WEAPON AND WAS AT CHARMING'S MERCY WHEN THE VALIANT KNIGHT HAD KILLED THE GIANT THE RAVEN CROAKED FROM A TREE NEAR BY
WHEN A YEAR SHOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY THE THREE BROTHERS ALL STARTED TOGETHER A GREAT NUMBER OF LORDS AND SERVANTS ACCOMPANIED THEM OUT OF THE CITY BUT WHEN THEY HAD RIDDEN ABOUT A LEAGUE THEY SENT EVERYONE BACK
YES SAID SHE NOW I AM POPE SO THERE HE STOOD GAZING AT HER AND IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT A SHINING SUN ALAS WIFE HE SAID ART THOU BETTER OFF FOR BEING POPE
THEY KNEW THAT THIS MUST BE THE PRETTIEST LITTLE DOG IN THE WORLD HOWEVER THE KING DID NOT FEEL INCLINED TO GIVE UP HIS THRONE JUST YET SO HE TOLD THE BROTHERS THAT THERE WAS ONE MORE TASK THEY MUST FIRST PERFORM THEY MUST BRING HIM A PIECE OF MUSLIN SO FINE
HEARKEN UNTO ME MY WIFE ILSEBIL WILL HAVE HER OWN WAY WHATEVER I WISH WHATEVER I SAY THE FLOUNDER CAME SWIMMING UP AND SAID WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT
HE KNOCKED AT THE GATES BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AND PRESENTLY DRIVEN BY HUNGER AND COLD HE MADE BOLD TO ENTER AND MOUNTED THE MARBLE STEPS INTO THE GREAT HALL ALL THE WAY HE NEVER SAW A SOUL THERE WAS A BIG FIRE IN THE HALL
THEN SHE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE HER HAIR STOOD ON END SHE PANTED FOR BREATH AND SCREAMED I WON'T BEAR IT ANY LONGER WILT THOU GO THEN HE PULLED ON HIS TROUSERS AND TORE AWAY LIKE A MADMAN
AND SUCH A DELICIOUS DINNER SMOKING HOT AS IF IT HAD JUST COME FROM THE KITCHEN THEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAT DOWN AND SAID THE SHORTEST GRACE SHE KNEW PRAY GOD BE OUR GUEST FOR ALL TIME
HE WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO ANY CREATURE THAT HE DESIRES AND WILL UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF ALL ANIMALS WHEN HE WISHES TO RETURN TO HIS OWN FORM LET HIM BOW TO THE EAST THREE TIMES REPEATING THE WORD MATABOR
PLACED THE DOG AGAIN ON THE BOX AND PASSED ON TO THE SECOND DOOR HE UNLOCKED IT YES THERE SAT ANOTHER DOG ON ANOTHER BOX WITH GREAT EYES AS BIG AS MILL WHEELS
HOW HAVE YOU COME TO OUR HOUSE SAID THE DWARFS THEN SHE TOLD THEM THAT THE QUEEN HAD WISHED TO HAVE HER KILLED BUT THAT THE HUNTSMAN HAD SPARED HER LIFE SHE HAD RUN FOR THE WHOLE DAY UNTIL AT LAST SHE HAD FOUND THEIR HOUSE
THEY HAD SCARCELY STARTED WHEN THE KING'S EYES FELL ON A GREAT WHITE CROSS HERE IT IS
NOW I AM CROWING WITH A FULL THROAT AS LONG AS I CAN AH BUT YOU RED COMB REPLIED THE ASS RATHER COME AWAY WITH US WE ARE GOING TO BREMEN TO FIND THERE SOMETHING BETTER THAN DEATH
GROWLED THE WOLF SPRINGING UP SUDDENLY AT RED RIDING HOOD BUT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND TWO TALL WOOD CUTTERS
HE FOUND THE SEA WAS NO LONGER GREEN IT WAS STILL CALM BUT DARK VIOLET AND GRAY HE STOOD BY IT AND SAID FLOUNDER FLOUNDER IN THE SEA PRYTHEE HEARKEN UNTO ME
AND THEN OUTSPOKE A BROWNIE WITH A LONG BEARD ON HIS CHIN I HAVE SPUN UP ALL THE TOW SAID HE AND I WANT SOME MORE TO SPIN I'VE SPUN A
THE HUBBUB WAS TERRIBLE AND THE POOR OLD DAME WAS QUITE BEWILDERED HOW COULD SHE TELL WHICH DOOR SHE HAD MARKED IT WAS QUITE USELESS THE DOG HAD PERPLEXED EVERYBODY
DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS HE WENT AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GARDEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS FULL OF ROSES RED AND WHITE AND PINK AND YELLOW AND THE MERCHANT LOOKED AT THEM AND REMEMBERED BEAUTY'S WISH OH MY POOR DAUGHTERS HE SAID
OH BRING ME A ROSE SAID BEAUTY HASTILY HER FATHER KISSED HER FONDLY AND SET OUT YOU SILLY GIRL SAID MARIGOLD YOU JUST WANT OUR FATHER TO THINK YOU ARE MORE UNSELFISH THAN WE ARE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT A ROSE INDEED
THEN THEY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME BURST INTO SUCH PEALS OF LAUGHTER THAT THE TWO STORKS FLEW AWAY SUDDENLY HOWEVER THE VIZIER CEASED HIS MIRTH AND COMMENCED BOWING TO THE EAST THE CALIPH RECOVERED HIMSELF AND DID THE SAME BUT NEITHER COULD THINK OF THE MAGIC WORD
AND BEAUTY AND THE BEAST WHO WAS A BEAST NO MORE BUT A HANDSOME PRINCE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND INDEED I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIVING HAPPILY STILL
TO MAKE YOU STAY WITH US HERE AND BE HAPPY I WILL NOT STAY HERE SHE SAID UNLESS MY HUSBAND COMES AND LIVES HERE TOO I WILL SEND FOR HIM AT ONCE SAID HER FATHER SO HE SENT THE BASKET DOWN EMPTY AND IT RESTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANCING RING
AND GAVE UP THE PIGEON AT ONCE WHEREUPON THE WHITE QUEEN TOLD HIM TO SEEK HER MOTHER WITHOUT DELAY
SHE LEAVES HER SUPPER EVERY DAY AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN PUT FOR HER HAS BEEN WASTED SHE MUST GET FOOD SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THEY DETERMINED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH AND THEY ARRANGED THAT WHEN TWO EYES TOOK HER GOAT TO THE FIELD
I VALUED IT MORE THAN ALL MY OTHER JEWELS AND NOTHING BUT ITS RECOVERY CAN PERSUADE ME TO YOUR SUIT CHARMING COULD URGE NO MORE BUT OFFERED AN EMBROIDERED SCARF AND HIS LITTLE DOG FRISK AS TOKENS OF DEVOTION
I WISH WE HAD GONE SAID MARIGOLD BEAUTY ALWAYS GETS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING TELL US ALL ABOUT YOUR GRAND PALACE SAID DRESSALINDA AND WHAT YOU DO AND HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO BEAUTY THINKING IT WOULD AMUSE THEM TO HEAR
DO NOT BE DISTRESSED ABOUT THAT SAID SHE BUT TRUST TO ME IN THE MORNING HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW A WONDERFUL MARBLE PALACE WITH A ROOF OF GOLD WHEN THE MAGICIAN BEHELD IT HE EXCLAIMED
PIECE OF HEMPEN CLOTH AND I WANT TO SPIN ANOTHER A LITTLE SHEET FOR MARY'S BED AND AN APRON FOR HER MOTHER
WHEN HE GOT OUT OF BED HE FOUND HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR FOR ON THE CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE LAY A FINE SUIT OF NEW CLOTHES MARKED WITH HIS NAME AND WITH TEN GOLD PIECES IN EVERY POCKET
I DID NOT THINK AFTER ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THAT YOU WOULD GRUDGE ME A FLOWER TELL ME ABOUT THIS DAUGHTER OF YOURS SAID THE BEAST SUDDENLY IS SHE A GOOD GIRL THE BEST AND DEAREST IN THE WORLD SAID THE OLD MERCHANT AND THEN HE BEGAN TO WEEP
INDEED SISTER SAID BEAUTY THAT WAS NOT THE REASON I THOUGHT OUR FATHER WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO DO IN SEEING TO THE SAFETY OF HIS SHIP WITHOUT BEING TROUBLED TO DO SHOPPING FOR ME BUT THE SISTERS WERE VERY MUCH OFFENDED
YES YES I WISH WE WERE THERE REPLIED THE ASS THEN THESE ANIMALS TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER HOW THEY SHOULD CONTRIVE TO DRIVE AWAY THE ROBBERS AND AT LAST THEY THOUGHT OF A WAY
NEAR THE WARM ASHES AND THE COCK FLEW UP ON A BEAM WHICH RAN ACROSS THE ROOM WEARY WITH THEIR LONG WALK THEY SOON WENT TO SLEEP AT MIDNIGHT THE ROBBERS PERCEIVED FROM THEIR RETREAT THAT NO
SO ONE DAY SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A MOUND IN THE FIELD AND BEGAN TO WEEP AND CRY SO BITTERLY THAT TWO LITTLE RIVULETS FLOWED FROM HER EYES
BEFORE HIM STOOD A MISERABLE HOVEL INTO WHICH BEING TIRED AFTER HIS LONG UNSUCCESSFUL CHASE HE ENTERED TO ASK FOR A DRINK OF WATER AN OLD WOMAN SEATED IN THE HUT AT A SPINNING WHEEL
THEN THE ROBBER RAN BACK AS WELL AS HE COULD TO HIS CAPTAIN AND SAID AH MY MASTER THERE DWELLS A HORRIBLE WITCH IN THE HOUSE WHO SPAT ON ME AND SCRATCHED MY FACE WITH HER LONG NAILS
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AND OFFERED HIM A SPLENDID ESCORT BUT HE ASKED ONLY FOR A GOOD HORSE EARLY THE NEXT DAY HE SET FORTH WITH A RESOLUTE HEART AND THE KING'S LETTER TO THE PRINCESS ONE DAY
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT A REAL BROWNIE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE HOUSE BUT AS SHE SAT IN HER CHAIR DAY AFTER DAY WATCHING THE BOYS AT THEIR WORK
AND ASKED FOR THE BEST ROOMS AND FOR DINNER ORDERED ALL HIS FAVORITE PUDDINGS AND FRUITS THE SERVANT WHO CLEANED HIS BOOTS TOSSED HER HEAD SHABBY BOOTS FOR A RICH MAN TO WEAR SHE SAID
THE PRINCESS AND ALL THE PEOPLE TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM
BIG ROLLING EYES EYES AS LARGE AS THE ROUND TOWER AND THEY WOULD NOT KEEP STILL NO ROUND AND ROUND THEY ROLLED
HYACINTHIA TOOK THE LITTLE CROSS FROM THE NECK OF THE PRINCE AND CHANGED HERSELF INTO A CHURCH THE PRINCE INTO A MONK AND THE HORSE INTO THE BELFRY SO THAT WHEN THE MAGICIAN CAME UP HE LOST ALL TRACE OF THEM
IT IS HERE SAID THE QUEEN FOR ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE TOO HAD SEEN A DOOR WITH A GREAT WHITE CROSS THEN ALL THE LORDS AND LADIES CRIED
AND SPRINKLE HIS BLOOD LIKE WATER BUT ON THE WAY THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS LOOKED IN ON THE PRINCESS JUST TO TELL HER HOW HE CAME TO BE DELAYED AND SHE AFTER READING THE MESSAGE ON THE POTSHERD
THOSE MUST BE THE STAR PEOPLE SAID HIS MOTHER WHO WAS A GREAT MAGICIAN THE PRAIRIE WAS FULL OF MAGIC IN THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE WHITE MAN CAME AND THE BUFFALO WENT YOU HAD BETTER TAKE AN INDIAN GIRL FOR YOUR WIFE
I HEARD THE DROPS OF THE WATER MADE
HE MUST HAVE SILVER HE STUFFED HIS POCKETS AND HIS KNAPSACK WITH THE SILVER COINS AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS HE WAS RICH NOW ON HE WENT
FEAR LEST EVIL SHOULD BEFALL YOU THE KING TO ALLAY THEIR ANXIETY PROMISED REGARD FOR THEIR WISHES AND SET OUT TOWARD THE SOUTH BUT AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT ALTHOUGH HE HUNTED DILIGENTLY
BUT THE SOLDIER WAS BRAVE HE HAD BEEN TO THE WARS GOOD EVENING HE SAID AND HE LIFTED HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY FOR NEVER BEFORE IN
THE MATERIALS THEY HAD BROUGHT WERE OF EXTREMELY FINE TEXTURE AND PASSED EASILY THROUGH THE EYE OF A DARNING NEEDLE BUT THROUGH THE SMALL NEEDLE THE KING HAD PROVIDED THEY WOULD NOT PASS THEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCE STEPPED INTO THE GREAT HALL
THAT IF HE WOULD GIVE HER THIS THIRD PIGEON SHE WOULD DO YET MORE FOR HIM
BIGGER SILLIES THAN YOU THREE THEN I'LL COME BACK AND MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SO HE WISHED THEM GOOD BY AND STARTED OFF ON HIS TRAVELS AND LEFT THEM ALL CRYING BECAUSE THE GIRL HAD LOST HER SWEETHEART
FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
SAID TOMMY AND YOU JOHNNY CAN DIG SOME POTATOES TO ROAST FOR BREAKFAST THEY SWEPT THE ROOM AND LAID THE TABLE JUST AS THEY WERE PUTTING THE POTATOES IN A DISH THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS
NEVERTHELESS A BURNING DESIRE TO CAPTURE AND POSSESS THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGE CREATURE FILLED HIS BREAST
WHILE YOU ARE ASLEEP THEY MIGHT BE RUNNING ALL OVER THE WORLD COME LET US GO HOME SO THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE AND LITTLE TWO EYES AGAIN LEFT THE SCRAPS ON THE DISH UNTOUCHED
SO THAT WAS ANOTHER BIG SILLY
AND I AM TO SEE HOW SHE IS AND TELL MOTHER WHEN I GET BACK SAID THE CHILD WITH A SMILE AND SAID THE WOLF
THEREFORE WHEN HER FATHER DIED THERE WOULD BE NO HEIR TO THE THRONE THEY GREATLY FEARED SHE MUST BE OUT OF HER MIND FOR THOUGH EVERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN THE KINGDOM HAD BEEN SHOWN TO HER SHE DECLARED SHE WOULD ONLY MARRY ONE WHO WAS THE SON
SHE NEVER WENT BACK TO THE STAR MAIDENS DANCING RING BUT SHE STILL LIVED ON BERRIES AND CORN BECAUSE SHE WOULD NEVER KILL ANYTHING EXCEPT ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE YELLOW BIRD
AT FIRST SHE SAT AS STIFF AS A POST WITHOUT STIRRING THEN HE SAID NOW WIFE BE CONTENT WITH BEING POPE HIGHER THOU CANST NOT GO
TILL HE REACHED THE CENTER AND PLUCKED THE TALLEST EAR BUT AS HE TURNED HOMEWARD A THOUSAND SWEET VOICES ROSE BEHIND HIM CRYING IN TENDEREST ACCENTS
YOU HAVE ARGUED SO ELOQUENTLY REPLIED SHE THAT I REGRET TO DENY YOU BUT I HAVE MADE A VOW NOT TO MARRY UNTIL THE AMBASSADOR CAN RETURN TO ME A RING WHICH I LOST IN THE RIVER A MONTH AGO
AND THEY GOT VERY FRIENDLY TOGETHER BUT IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE
WHERE THE ASS WAS STRETCHED OUT IT GAVE HIM A POWERFUL KICK WITH ITS HIND FOOT THIS WAS NOT ALL FOR THE COCK AWAKING AT THE NOISE CLAPPED HIS WINGS AND CRIED FROM THE BEAM COCK A DOODLE DOO COCK A DOODLE DO
YOU HAVE A GOOD VOICE AND IF WE MAKE MUSIC TOGETHER IT WILL HAVE FULL PLAY THE COCK CONSENTED TO THIS PLAN AND SO ALL FOUR TRAVELED ON TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT HOWEVER REACH BREMEN
THEN THE WICKED WOMAN GAVE A SCREAM AND WAS SO WRETCHED SO UTTERLY WRETCHED THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AT FIRST SHE WOULD NOT GO TO THE WEDDING AT ALL BUT SHE HAD NO PEACE AND MUST GO TO SEE THE YOUNG QUEEN
RAN AWAY ALONG THE ROAD TO BREMEN THERE THOUGHT HE I CAN BE TOWN MUSICIAN WHEN HE HAD RUN SOME WAY HE FOUND A HOUND LYING BY THE ROADSIDE YAWNING LIKE ONE WHO WAS VERY TIRED
DEAREST LITTLE MOTHER I WILL BE YOUR OTHER EYE ALWAYS AFTER THIS HE SET OFF TO MARRY THE PRINCESS AS HE HAD PROMISED BUT WHEN PASSING BY THE WHITE QUEEN'S PALACE
FOR MANY WEARY YEARS OLBERS KEPT UP A PATIENT AND UNREMITTING SEARCH FOR MORE OF THESE SMALL BODIES OR FRAGMENTS OF THE LARGE PLANET AS HE THOUGHT THEM BUT HIS PATIENCE WENT UNREWARDED AND HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY WITHOUT SEEING OR KNOWING OF ANY MORE
BUT IT IS TRANSPARENT TO THAT PARTICULAR PORTION WHICH AFFECTS OUR EYES WITH THE SENSATION OF RED
COULD IT BE THAT THE LIGHT PARTICLES AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE PRISM TRAVELLED IN VARIOUSLY CURVED LINES AS SPINNING RACQUET BALLS DO TO EXAMINE THIS HE MEASURED THE LENGTH OF THE OVAL PATCH WHEN THE SCREEN WAS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE PRISM
IT HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF COURSE TO BE A STAR FOR IT SHINES LIKE A STAR OF THE SIXTH MAGNITUDE AND CAN THEREFORE BE JUST SEEN WITHOUT A TELESCOPE IF ONE KNOWS PRECISELY WHERE TO LOOK FOR IT AND IF ONE HAS GOOD SIGHT BUT IF IT HAD BEEN SEEN AND CATALOGUED AS A STAR
IN A WINDOW SHUTTER INSERTED THE PRISM IN THE LIGHT AND RECEIVED THE DEFLECTED BEAM ON A WHITE SCREEN TURNING THE PRISM ABOUT TILL IT WAS DEVIATED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE THE PATCH ON THE SCREEN WAS NOT A ROUND DISK
MEANWHILE HOME AFFAIRS HAD GONE TO RACK AND RUIN HIS FATHER ABANDONED THE HOME AND LATER DIED ABROAD THE MOTHER QUARRELLED WITH ALL HER RELATIONS INCLUDING HER SON JOHN
HE HAD BEEN AT CAMBRIDGE DOUBTLESS HAD HEARD NEWTON LECTURE AND HAD ACQUIRED A GREAT VENERATION FOR HIM IN JANUARY SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE FIND WREN OFFERING HOOKE AND HALLEY A PRIZE IN THE SHAPE OF A BOOK WORTH FORTY SHILLINGS
BUT THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL HUNDREDS KNOWN THEIR DIAMETERS RANGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO TWENTY MILES NEPTUNE WAS DISCOVERED FROM THE PERTURBATIONS OF URANUS BY SHEER CALCULATION
THE DEFECTS OF REFRACTORS SEEMED IRREMEDIABLE BEING FOUNDED IN THE NATURE OF LIGHT ITSELF SO HE GAVE UP HIS GLASS WORKS AND PROCEEDED TO THINK OF REFLEXION FROM METAL SPECULA A CONCAVE MIRROR FORMS AN IMAGE JUST AS A LENS DOES
THE ANALOGY IS MORE SUPERFICIAL THAN REAL IT DOES NOT OBEY KEPLER'S LAWS STILL IT WAS A STRIKING EXPERIMENT THEY HAD GUESSED AT A LAW OF INVERSE SQUARES AND THEIR DIFFICULTY WAS TO PROVE WHAT CURVE A BODY SUBJECT TO IT WOULD DESCRIBE
WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A PICTURE OF THE MONTH GETTING GRADUALLY SHORTER THAN THE DAY THE MOON GRADUALLY APPROACHING INSTEAD OF RECEDING AND SO INCALCULABLE MYRIADS OF AGES HENCE PRECIPITATING ITSELF UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHENCE IT AROSE
AND DRIVE AND DRAG UNTIL EVEN THE HARDEST ROCK LIKE BASALT BECOMES HONEYCOMBED INTO STRANGE GALLERIES AND PASSAGES FINGAL'S CAVE FOR INSTANCE AND THE SOFTER PARTS ARE CRUMBLED AWAY BUT THE AREA NOW EXPOSED TO THE TEETH OF THE WAVES IS NOT GREAT
AND THUS HAD ANOTHER VARIABLE AT HIS DISPOSAL IN FACT TWO FOR HE HAD AN EQUANT FOR THE EARTH AND ANOTHER FOR MARS GETTING A PATTERN OF THE KIND SUGGESTED IN FIG TWENTY NINE
TRADE WINDS AND STORMS WERE ALSO MORE VIOLENT IF EVER THE MOON WERE CLOSE TO THE EARTH IT WOULD HAVE TO REVOLVE ROUND IT IN ABOUT THREE HOURS IF THE EARTH ROTATED ON ITS AXIS IN THREE HOURS
CONSEQUENTLY A BETTER APPROXIMATION WILL BE OBTAINED BY ADDING A CONSTANT TO EACH TERM OF AN APPROPRIATE GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION THUS FORM A DOUBLING SERIES LIKE THIS
AS HE SURELY MUST HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN GREATNESS NO SELF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THE LAST THING THAT AFFECTED HIM IT IS FOR A GREAT MAN'S CONTEMPORARIES TO DISCOVER HIM TO MAKE MUCH OF HIM AND TO PUT HIM IN SURROUNDINGS WHERE HE MAY FLOURISH LUXURIANTLY
FATHER AN OFFICER IN THE DUKE'S ARMY MOTHER SOMETHING OF A VIRAGO BOTH VERY POOR KEPLER WAS UTILIZED AS A TAVERN POT BOY BUT ULTIMATELY SENT TO A CHARITY SCHOOL AND THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TUEBINGEN
BROODING OVER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE IDEA OF TRYING SOLID FIGURES SUDDENLY STRIKES HIM WHAT HAVE PLANE FIGURES TO DO WITH THE CELESTIAL ORBITS HE CRIES OUT INSCRIBE THE REGULAR SOLIDS
GRADUALLY BUT VERY SLOWLY THE MOON IS RECEDING FROM US AND THE MONTH IS BECOMING LONGER THE TIDES OF THE EARTH ARE PUSHING IT AWAY THIS IS NOT A PERIODIC DISTURBANCE LIKE THE TEMPORARY ACCELERATION OF ITS MOTION DISCOVERED BY LAPLACE
FAR OLDER THAN ANY FORMS OF LIFE FOSSIL OR OTHERWISE AGES AMONG THE OLDEST KNOWN TO GEOLOGY A DENUDING AGENT MUST HAVE THEN EXISTED FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY WE NOW KNOW
THE NEWS FLASHED OVER EUROPE AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED WITH WHICH NEWS COULD TRAVEL AT THAT DATE WHICH WAS NOT VERY FAST
N PLUS ONE INSTANTS OR PRACTICALLY WHEN N IS BIG
HE HAD SHREWD INKLINGS OF THE TRUTH THOUGH HIS GUESSES WERE BASED ON LITTLE ELSE THAN A MOST SAGACIOUS INTUITION HE SURMISED ALSO THAT GRAVITY WAS THE FORCE CONCERNED AND ASSERTED THAT THE PATH OF AN ORDINARY PROJECTILE WAS AN ELLIPSE LIKE THE PATH OF A PLANET WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT
AT FIRST SIGHT AND TO ORDINARY CAREFUL INSPECTION THIS DIFFERS FROM THE ZONE OF ASTEROIDS IN BEING A SOLID LUMP OF MATTER LIKE A QUOIT BUT IT IS EASY TO SHOW FROM THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION THAT A SOLID RING COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE STABLE
TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER BOOK STILL HE WORKED ON AT THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES OF TYCHO AND ULTIMATELY WITH SOME SMALL HELP FROM VIENNA COMPLETED THEM BUT HE COULD NOT GET THE MEANS TO PRINT THEM
AND THE ONLY SOLUTION OFFERED BY GEOLOGISTS WAS UNLIMITED TIME GIVEN UNLIMITED TIME THEY COULD OF COURSE BE FORMED NO MATTER HOW SLOWLY THE PROCESS WENT ON
AND IN THAT CASE SOME PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT MAY BE PRODUCED THE PROBABLE EFFECT SEEMS LIKELY TO BE A GENTLE HEAVING TIDE IN THE SOLAR SURFACE WITH BREAKING UP OF ANY INCIPIENT CRUST
IF I HAVE DONE THE PUBLIC ANY SERVICE THIS WAY
AND PART OF ITS WOOD IS PRESERVED I HAVE MENTIONED VOLTAIRE IN CONNECTION WITH NEWTON'S PHILOSOPHY THIS ACUTE CRITIC AT A LATER STAGE DID A GOOD DEAL TO POPULARISE IT THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND TO OVERTURN THAT OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMAN DESCARTES
AND RUDE WEATHER PREDICTIONS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC ARE ROUGHLY POSSIBLE BAROMETERS AND THERMOMETERS AND ANEMOMETERS AND ALL THEIR TRIBE REPRESENT THE ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ISLAND OF HUEN
AND WAS CONSIDERED MERELY AS ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES WHICH COULD BE SUGGESTED AS FAIRLY PROBABLE IT IS PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO UNELABORATED GUESSES NOT UNTIL THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN HYPOTHESIS HAVE BEEN LABORIOUSLY WORKED OUT
AND HE ALWAYS USED TO REGARD HIS PART IN IT WITH PECULIAR PRIDE AND PLEASURE AND HOW WAS THE PRINCIPIA RECEIVED CONSIDERING THE ABSTRUSE NATURE OF ITS SUBJECT IT WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM
WITH UNEXAMPLED DILIGENCE AT LENGTH HE HIT UPON A POINT THAT SEEMED NEARLY RIGHT HE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND THE TRUTH BUT NO BEFORE LONG THE POSITION OF THE PLANET AS CALCULATED
HE WAS NOT A MAN OF BUSINESS HE DID NOT ANSWER PROFESSOR AIRY'S LETTER
AT ONCE HE SET TO WORK IN A THOROUGH AND SYSTEMATIC WAY HE FIRST CONSIDERED WHETHER THE DISCREPANCIES COULD BE DUE TO ERRORS IN THE TABLES OR ERRORS IN THE OLD OBSERVATIONS HE DISCUSSED THEM WITH MINUTE CARE AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WERE NOT THUS TO BE EXPLAINED AWAY
PROFESSOR CHALLIS SAID HE WOULD CONDUCT THE SEARCH HIMSELF AND SHORTLY COMMENCED A LEISURELY AND DIGNIFIED SERIES OF SWEEPS ROUND ABOUT THE PLACE ASSIGNED BY THEORY
THE FAME OF HIS MATHEMATICAL GENIUS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND A MOTION WAS MADE TO GET HIM ELECTED A FELLOW OF THAT BODY THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE OLDEST AND MOST FAMOUS OF ALL SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES WITH A CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE
AND THERE APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN AT A HANDSOME BUT SELDOM PAID SALARY OBSERVED THE NEW STAR OF SIXTEEN O FOUR ENDEAVOURED TO FIND THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT FROM VITELLIO'S MEASUREMENTS BUT FAILED
AND URANUS IS ONLY ABOUT HALF AS FAR AWAY AS NEPTUNE IS NEITHER IN PARIS NOR YET AT GREENWICH WAS ANY OPTICAL SEARCH UNDERTAKEN
WHO HAS EVER LIVED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN FIND NO PARALLEL FOR IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OTHER NATIONS ADMIT HIS SCIENTIFIC PRE EMINENCE WITH AS MUCH ALACRITY AS WE DO
AT THE RIPE AGE OF EIGHTY FIVE HIS BODY LAY IN STATE IN THE JERUSALEM CHAMBER AND HE WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY SIX PEERS BEARING THE PALL
SOMETHING WAS LIABLE TO SEPARATE FROM IT HERE WE FIND THE MOON IN CONTACT WITH IT AND GOING ROUND IT IN THIS SAME THREE HOUR PERIOD SURELY THE TWO ARE CONNECTED
WHICH NOT A DOZEN MEN LIVING COULD AT THE TIME COMPREHEND IT IS NO SMALL PART OF THE MERIT OF HALLEY THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE TRANSCENDENT VALUE OF THE YET UNFINISHED WORK THAT HE BROUGHT IT TO LIGHT AND ASSISTED IN ITS BECOMING UNDERSTOOD TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
A SERIES OF PAPERS WHICH WERE LONG AFTERWARDS INCORPORATED AND PUBLISHED AS HIS OPTICS A MAGNIFICENT WORK WHICH OF ITSELF SUFFICES TO PLACE ITS AUTHOR IN THE FIRST RANK OF THE WORLD'S MEN OF SCIENCE
THAT WHEN HE MADE THE CIRCUIT OVAL HIS LAW OF EQUABLE DESCRIPTION OF AREAS BROKE DOWN THAT SEEMED TO REQUIRE THE CIRCULAR ORBIT AND YET NO CIRCULAR ORBIT WAS QUITE ACCURATE
UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH AND AS HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BY FAR THE BEST PLANETARY OBSERVATIONS OF ANY MAN LIVING KEPLER WROTE TO HIM TO KNOW IF HE MIGHT COME AND EXAMINE THEM SO AS TO PERFECT HIS THEORY
IT IS VERY LIKE ONE OF THOSE ANECDOTES WHICH ARE EASILY INVENTED AND BELIEVED IN AND VERY OFTEN TURN OUT ON SCRUTINY TO HAVE NO FOUNDATION FORTUNATELY THIS ANECDOTE IS WELL AUTHENTICATED AND MOREOVER IS INTRINSICALLY PROBABLE
AND THE TABLES UPON WHICH TYCHO WAS NOW ENGAGED ARE WELL CALLED THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES THESE TABLES OF PLANETARY MOTION TYCHO HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS THE MAIN WORK OF HIS LIFE BUT HE DIED BEFORE THEY WERE FINISHED
WAS IT LIKELY THAT A YOUNG AND UNKNOWN MAN SHOULD HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SOLVED SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT A PROBLEM IT WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKELY STILL HE WOULD TEST HIM
HOW A GAP BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER CAUSED A MISSING PLANET TO BE SUSPECTED AND LOOKED FOR AND TO BE FOUND IN A HUNDRED PIECES WE HAVE SEEN ALSO HOW THE ABNORMAL PROPER MOTION OF SIRIUS SUGGESTED TO BESSEL THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNSEEN COMPANION
A CHANGE OF JUDGE HAVING IN PROCESS OF TIME OCCURRED THE DEFENDANT SAW HIS WAY TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE OLD LADY BY ACCUSING HER OF SORCERY SHE WAS SENT TO PRISON AND CONDEMNED TO THE TORTURE
IN SIXTEEN O ONE KEPLER WAS APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN TO ASSIST TYCHO IN HIS CALCULATIONS THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH DID A GOOD PIECE OF WORK IN THUS MAINTAINING THESE TWO EMINENT MEN BUT IT IS QUITE CLEAR
SEVENTEEN FIFTY SIX MINUS FORTY FIVE POINT SEVEN LE MONNIER SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR MINUS THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE
POINT YOUR TELESCOPE IN SUCH A DIRECTION AT SUCH A TIME AND YOU WILL SEE A NEW PLANET HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO MAN THIS MUST ALWAYS APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION WITH DRAMATIC INTENSITY
IF WE THINK OF THE STATE OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE IF IT HAD AN ATMOSPHERE AT THAT REMOTE DATE WE SHALL RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF THE MOST FEARFUL TORNADOES
AND THEN BRILLIANT IDEA HE REMEMBERS THAT THERE ARE BUT FIVE EUCLID HAD SHOWN
THE IDEA PERHAPS DID NOT NATURALLY OCCUR TO HIM ANY MORE THAN THE IDEA OF PUBLISHING HIS WORK DID HE WAS ALWAYS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN AND A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THOUGH SOMEWHAT OF THE ARIAN OR UNITARIAN PERSUASION SO AT LEAST IT IS ASSERTED BY ORTHODOX DIVINES WHO UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS
TO WHICH HE FELT COMPELLED TO FIND ANSWERS MANY MEN WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS PART OF THE WORK AND TAKEN IT AS EVIDENCE OF INTEREST AND SUCCESS BUT TO NEWTON'S SHY AND RETIRING DISPOSITION THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE MERELY PAINFUL HE WRITES INDEED HIS ANSWERS WITH GREAT PATIENCE AND ABILITY
NOT GREATLY MORE THAN THIS PERIOD OF TIME HAS ELAPSED SINCE IT WAS IN A MOLTEN CONDITION IT MAY BE AS OLD AS A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS BUT ITS AGE IS BELIEVED BY THOSE MOST COMPETENT TO JUDGE TO BE MORE LIKELY WITHIN THIS LIMIT THAN BEYOND IT BUT IF WE ASK
I BELIEVE HE MADE RATHER A GOOD MASTER AND TURNED OUT EXCELLENT COINS CERTAINLY HE DEVOTED HIS ATTENTION TO HIS WORK THERE IN A MOST EXEMPLARY MANNER BUT WHAT A PITIFUL BUSINESS IT ALL IS HERE IS A MAN SENT BY HEAVEN
TO SUPERNATURAL AGENCY WE HAVE HAD OUR COPERNICAN ERA NOT PERHAPS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BUT STILL ACHIEVED
THE ONLY USEFUL WAY REALLY TO READ A BOOK LIKE THAT IS TO PORE OVER EVERY SENTENCE IT IS NO BOOK TO BE SKIMMED WHILE THE PRINCIPIA WAS PREPARING FOR THE PRESS A CURIOUS INCIDENT OF CONTACT BETWEEN ENGLISH HISTORY AND THE UNIVERSITY OCCURRED
FRESH LITTLE ERRORS APPEARED AND GREW IN IMPORTANCE THUS HE ANNOUNCES IT HIMSELF WHILE THUS TRIUMPHING OVER MARS AND PREPARING FOR HIM AS FOR ONE ALREADY VANQUISHED
THIS RESIDUAL DISCREPANCY WHEN EVERY KNOWN CAUSE HAS BEEN ALLOWED FOR AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE HOUR THE ECLIPSE OCCURRED LATER THAN CALCULATION WARRANTS NOW THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED FROM EITHER OF TWO CAUSES
SOME OF THEM SO LONG THAT THEY HAD NO TUBE ALL OF THEM EGREGIOUSLY CUMBROUS YET IT WAS WITH SUCH INSTRUMENTS THAT ALL THE EARLY DISCOVERIES WERE MADE
THE EARTH IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SMALL PLANETS THAT HAS AN APPRECIABLE MOON AND HENCE THERE IS NOTHING FORCED OR UNNATURAL IN SUPPOSING THAT IT MAY HAVE HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL HISTORY EVIDENTLY HOWEVER TIDAL PHENOMENA MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
OF THE STEPS BY WHICH KEPLER ROSE TO HIS GREAT GENERALIZATIONS THE TWO LAWS WHICH HAVE IMMORTALIZED HIS NAME ALL THE COMPLICATIONS OF EPICYCLE EQUANT DEFERENT EXCENTRIC
AND SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONE FIFTIETH THE DIAMETER OF THE LENS TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY CALLED CHROMATIC ABERRATION TELESCOPE GLASSES WERE MADE SMALL AND OF VERY LONG FOCUS
THOUGH IT SERVES WELL ENOUGH FOR THE CASE OF A BALL WHIRLED AT THE END OF AN ELASTIC STRING AFTER HAVING GOT UP THE WHIRL THE HAND HOLDING THE STRING MAY REMAIN ALMOST FIXED AT THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE AND THE MOTION WILL CONTINUE STEADILY
AND OUT OF THIS MASS OF RUBBISH IT REQUIRES GREAT SKILL AND PATIENCE TO DETECT SUCH GEMS OF VALUE AS THERE MAY BE NOW THIS LETTER OF MISTER ADAMS'S WAS INDEED A JEWEL OF THE FIRST WATER AND NO DOUBT BORE ON ITS FACE A VERY DIFFERENT APPEARANCE FROM THE CHAFF OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
OF A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE COULD REALLY STATE OR PROVE BY INDISCREET FRIENDS THESE TWO GREAT MEN WERE SET SOMEWHAT AT LOGGERHEADS AND WORSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD THEY NOT MANAGED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS AND CORRESPOND PRIVATELY IN A QUITE FRIENDLY MANNER
AS GOD HAS WAITED SIX THOUSAND YEARS FOR AN OBSERVER SOON AFTER THIS GREAT WORK HIS THIRD BOOK APPEARED IT WAS AN EPITOME OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY
MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEREFORE I HAD ALTERED IT TO THIS ON THE FREE MOTION OF TWO BODIES BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS I RETAIN THE FORMER TITLE
WITH GREAT INGENUITY REMARKABLE SCIENTIFIC INSIGHT AND CONSUMMATE EXPERIMENTAL SKILL HE STANDS IN MANY RESPECTS ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH GALILEO BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE STARS EVEN OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE WHEN THE SUN IS UP
THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THEORY AND OBSERVATION SOME CAUSE WAS EVIDENTLY AT WORK ON THIS DISTANT PLANET CAUSING IT TO DISAGREE WITH ITS MOTION AS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD LOST HIS POWER FOR HE FREQUENTLY SOLVED PROBLEMS VERY QUICKLY WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN OUT BY GREAT CONTINENTAL MATHEMATICIANS AS A CHALLENGE TO THE WORLD WE MAY ASK WHY NEWTON ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE THUS BANDIED ABOUT
THE WAVES AND THE TIDES ARE STILL AT WORK ALONG EVERY COAST LINE EATING AWAY INTO THE CLIFFS UNDERMINING GRADUALLY AND SUBMERGING ACRE AFTER ACRE AND MAKING WITH THE REFUSE A SHINGLY OR A SANDY OR A MUDDY BEACH
AND HE WROTE TO TWO ASTRONOMERS ONE OF THEM BODE HIMSELF SAYING WHAT HE HAD OBSERVED HE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE TILL THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED BY ILLNESS AND COMPELLED TO CEASE HIS LETTERS DID NOT REACH THEIR DESTINATION TILL THE END OF MARCH
AND SUCH AN EFFECT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCED PERIODICALLY BY THE GREAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SOLAR SPOTS WHICH THEN BREAK OUT THE SOLAR TIDES ARE HOWEVER MUCH TOO SMALL TO APPRECIABLY PUSH ANY PLANET AWAY
EQUANTS AND OTHER REMNANTS OF THE GREEK SYSTEM AND USHERED IN THE DAWN OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
WILL REQUIRE AT THIS RATE THIRTY MILLION YEARS THE AGE OF THE EARTH IS NOT AT ALL ACCURATELY KNOWN BUT THERE ARE MANY GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING IT NOT TO BE MUCH OLDER THAN SOME THIRTY MILLION YEARS THAT IS TO SAY
CHARACTERIZED IT AS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE APPLICATIONS OF MATHEMATICS TO PHYSICS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT CONSTITUENT RINGS IN THE ENTIRE SATURNIAN ZONE AND EACH PERTURBS THE OTHER WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY RIPPLE AND PULSE IN CONCORD
OF A BYGONE AGE WONDERING WHAT MANNER OF MAN THIS WAS ABLE TO WIELD SUCH PONDEROUS IMPLEMENTS WITH SUCH APPARENT EASE TO HALLEY THE WORLD OWES A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE FIRST FOR DISCOVERING THE PRINCIPIA SECOND FOR SEEING IT THROUGH THE PRESS
CAMBRIDGE RAPIDLY BECAME NEWTONIAN BUT OXFORD REMAINED CARTESIAN FOR FIFTY YEARS OR MORE IT IS CURIOUS WHAT LITTLE HOLD SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS HAVE EVER SECURED IN THE OLDER AND MORE ECCLESIASTICAL UNIVERSITY
SOME PERTURBATIONS IN FACT WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF OUR IGNORANCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE BODY WHICH CAUSED THEM BUT THOUGH SUCH AN IDEA WAS MENTIONED AMONG ASTRONOMERS IT WAS NOT REGARDED WITH ANY SPECIAL FAVOUR
IT WAS FIRST KNOWINGLY SEEN BY GALLE OF BERLIN ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX
IN HIS OWN HEAVEN INTENDED WAY HOWEVER IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO JUDGE OF THESE THINGS PERHAPS IF HE HAD BEEN MAINTAINED AT THE NATIONAL EXPENSE TO DO THAT FOR WHICH HE WAS PRETERNATURALLY FITTED HE MIGHT HAVE WORN HIMSELF OUT PREMATURELY
HE THEN CONSULTED BREMIKER'S GREAT STAR CHART THE PART JUST ENGRAVED AND FINISHED AND SURE ENOUGH ON THAT CHART THERE WAS NO SUCH STAR THERE UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS THE PLANET
AMONG THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS BEING BOYLE HOOKE CHRISTOPHER WREN AND OTHER LESS FAMOUS NAMES BOYLE WAS A GREAT EXPERIMENTER A WORTHY FOLLOWER OF DOCTOR GILBERT HOOKE BEGAN AS HIS ASSISTANT BUT BEING OF A MOST EXTRAORDINARY INGENUITY
SEVENTEEN TWELVE PLUS NINETY TWO POINT SEVEN
RESOLUTION AND ANGER STILL EVIDENT EVEN IN THE SET OF THEIR SHOULDERS THE BOY WAS THOUGHTFUL THINKING BACK OVER WHAT NED HAD SAID OF THEM THAT FIRST DAY ON THE DOCKS FAITHFUL
THAT SIDE OF THE SHIP THAT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SEA THROUGH THE NARROW CHANNEL ENTRANCE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY COVERED WITH GREEN THE WORK WAS NOT YET FINISHED BUT MOST OF THE CREW WERE SLEEPING DURING THE HOT HOURS
QUITE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO BOYS HUNG SWAYING IN THE AIR CHRIS EXAMINED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN STRUCK THE GROUND THREE TIMES AGAIN THE BALLOON GENTLY COLLAPSED AND REFOLDED ITSELF
IS A SPY THERE HERE TAKE THIS CLUB AND BEAT ABOUT WE'LL CATCH EM
AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY THE WORDS CAME OUT INTERRUPTED BY PEALS AND CRACKS OF THUNDER THE SHOP WAS BLACK EXCEPT FOR THE PALER CRESCENT OF THE BOW WINDOW GIVING ONTO THE STREET
TAKING WITH THEM CASKS AND BARRELS TO REPLENISH THE SHIP'S WATER SUPPLY THEIR DEEP VOICES SWEPT BACK OVER THE WATER TO WHERE CHRIS STOOD BY THE OPEN PORT OF THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN HE WAS FORCING HIMSELF TOWARD THE MOMENT WHEN HE MUST BOARD THE VULTURE
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME HE HURRIED MEMORIZING AS HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND HOISTED IT ONCE MORE TO ITS HIGH SHELF LOOKING ABOUT HE FOUND THE INGREDIENTS THAT HAD BEEN LISTED
HIS MORE DELICATE FRIEND PURSUED STRETCHING OUT A LONG FINGER FOR THE PARAKEET TO PERCH ON WHICH TO HIS EVIDENT PLEASURE IT INSTANTLY DID
LOWERING HIS VOICE AND BENDING DOWN TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH CHRIS AND AMOS BUT BELIEVE ME THERE'S NO SOUNDER CAPTAIN AFLOAT THEY ALL KNOW IT HEREABOUTS FOR EZEKIAL BLIZZARD KNOWS THE CHINY SEAS BETTER THAN THE SIGHT OF HIS OWN FEET
HIS FEET STILL STRETCHED COMFORTABLY TOWARDS THE FLAMES HIS DARK HANDSOME FACE WAS DREAMY AND REMOTE AND CHRIS WONDERED IN WHAT FARAWAY PLACE OR TIME HIS TEACHER MOVED THE APPRENTICE SAT DOWN CROSS LEGGED WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE
SO LET HIM BE HAPPY AND I SHALL SEAL YOUR LIPS WITH REGARD TO THE SECRET OF THE JEWEL TREE FOR THAT MUST BE KNOWN TO NO ONE AND SO SAYING HE RUBBED A SALVE OVER CHRIS'S LIPS NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE TO JOURNEY AFTER COMMANDED MISTER WICKER
HE PAUSED AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NOT A STIR FROM HIS AUDIENCE
THE IMMINENT JOURNEY SO FAR AND PERHAPS SO PERILOUS SEEMED SUDDENLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM MISTER WICKER HAD TAKEN THE RIVER CHARTS AND ROLLED THEM UP AND NOW TURNED TO THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE
A SINGING BIRD IN A CAGE A PART OF THE PATTERN IN THE BROCADED CURTAINS OR A SECTION OF THE DESIGN IN THE INDIAN RUG THE BLUEBOTTLE FLY OR THE GOLDFISH BECAME AS EASY AS SAYING EUREKA AND ON ONE OCCASION
OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY MADE A POUTING FACE AT THE SLEEPING FIGURE OF CHEW EVIDENTLY OSTERBRIDGE WAS BORED HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS BUT NO ONE RESPONDED EXCEPT FOR THE TWO MEN AND THE PARAKEET THE VULTURE WAS DESERTED
THE GOLDFISH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN SAID TO HAVE CHANGED ITS EXPRESSION AND SMILED BEFORE BRUSHING A DROP OF WATER FROM HIS SLEEVE MISTER WICKER STOOD BESIDE THE TABLE SMILING HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED
CHRIS HAD LONG AGO DECIDED
OH DEAR ME YES A MOST UNUSUAL ROYAL PERSONAGE OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY SAID SMILING HAPPILY AT HIS PARAKEET MOST OF THEM ARE SO MUCH ALIKE HE SINGLED OUT SEVERAL FRESH FRUITS PEELING SOME FOR CLAGGETT CHEW
OUR FRUITS BETTER NOT TO EAT STRANGE FOOD IN THIS FOREIGNY PLACE GOOD LUCK HE ADDED CHRIS STUFFED THE DRIED FRUIT IN HIS POCKET AMOS TURNED BACK INTO THE DARKENING PINE KNOLL AND CHRIS PUSHED HIS WAY OUT TO THE NARROW STEEP LEDGE
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE AS SOON AS THE NIGHT WAS DARK ENOUGH CHRIS LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF NOT FEELING WELL OF BEING HOT AND DIZZY AND IN NO TIME CAPTAIN BLIZZARD HAD AS LOUDLY TOLD HIM HE WAS TO GO TO BED ON A COT IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN
MY LITTLE FEATHERED CAPTIVE HE SAID AND PONDERED
SHE WAS RIDING AT ANCHOR CLOSE INSHORE FARTHER DOWN THE COAST AND FINAL BOATFULS OF MEN WERE RETURNING FROM THE MERCHANTMAN CARRYING THE LAST OF THE SPOILS SWEEPING BY TOWARD THE BEACH CHRIS SAW THAT MOST OF THE BANDIT CREW WERE ALREADY DRUNK
YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO START AND I FEEL REASONABLY SURE THAT YOU WILL BE QUITE ABLE TO CHANGE BACK AGAIN IF YOU GET STUCK I CAN HELP YOU COME NOW HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO TOUCH CHRIS'S SHOULDER IN A REASSURING WAY HERE YOU GO REMEMBER
MISTER WICKER REMARKED AS CHRIS REJOINED HIM IS ALMOST TOO SIMPLE WE CAN DO THAT AT ANY TIME GRASPING THE END OF ONE OAR WITH MOVEMENTS TOO FAST FOR CHRIS'S EYES TO FOLLOW IN AN INSTANT THE BOAT WAS A ROPE AGAIN COILED OVER MISTER WICKER'S ARM
HERE IS THE SANDBAR THAT THE TIDE COVERS FOR BUT A SHORT TIME AND SHOULD THERE BE OTHER SHIPS CROWDING THE RIVER NEAR THIS POINT WE MUST SLIP THROUGH THERE THEN OR NOT AT ALL MISTER WICKER EXAMINED THE CHARTS AND NODDED
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY THE DAYS WENT BY WITH CHRIS'S MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS SPENT IN MISTER WICKER'S STUDY READING BOOKS TOO HEAVY FOR HIM TO LIFT LEARNING INCANTATIONS BY HEART AND HOW TO BLEND SIMPLE FORMULAE OVER THE FIRE
CHRIS REMAINED ALONE IN THE CABIN FROM THAT TIME SOON IN THE COOL OF THE NIGHT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE
ONLY TO A WOMAN MADE OF SILVER AND ROCK CRYSTAL STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS AND HUNG ABOUT WITH SHEER CURTAINS OF EMBROIDERED YELLOW SILK THE PALANQUIN BELONGED WITHOUT DOUBT TO A YOUNG GIRL OF THE ROYAL HOUSE
CHRIS SEARCHED AND SEARCHED AGAIN FOR THREE FACES AMONG THE CROWD THAT HE DID NOT FIND ZACHARY HEIGH THE CAPTAIN AND MISTER FINNEY WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AGHAST AS HE UNDERSTOOD NOW WHAT ZACHARY'S PLAN WAS
TIS BETTER NOT WAIT TILL THE MASTER DO PRESENT YOU PROPER TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THE MIRABELLE IS CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S CASTLE LIKE I WOULD SOONER YE WERE ASKED ABOARD BY HIM THEN SEEING CHRIS'S CRESTFALLEN FACE
PUTTING THE GLASS IN HIS POCKET HE REJOINED AMOS BUT AS HE DID SO THE LAST TWO SAILORS PUT DOWN THEIR CANNON BALLS AND WIPED THE SWEAT OFF THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THEIR ARMS IN THE ENSUING SILENCE THE RUSTLE OF THE RUSHES
THE SOUND ACCOMPANIED BY STEPS OATHS AND A RHYTHMICAL DROP AND SHUDDER CONTINUED FARTHER ALONG THE SHORE STEALTHILY TRYING NOT TO SHAKE THE RUSHES AND SO SHOW WHERE THEY MIGHT BE
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU'RE ALL ALONE CHRIS WAS TEMPTED TO TAKE HIS FRIEND WITH HIM BUT SOMEONE MUST GET THE NEWS BACK TO THE MIRABELLE
OR HE WOULD COCK HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AS IF WEIGHING ONE OF OSTERBRIDGE'S REMARKS IN A TRULY COMICAL MANNER LOOKING ABOUT MEANWHILE WITH HIS BLACK BEADY EYES CHRIS SAW THAT CLAGGETT CHEW WAS LYING IN A BUNK AGAINST ONE WALL
AND LED HIM INTO THE SHADE AND OF HOW SICK HE WAS THE HEAT AND THE SCREAM THE FEAR AND A SENSE OF HAVING FAILED IN WARNING THE CAPTAIN COMBINING TO CHURN HIS INSIDES INTO A QUEASY PLACE THAT VIOLENTLY REJECTED HIS PLEASANT BREAKFAST OF SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED AFTER WHAT SEEMED AN ENDLESS TIME AMID A GROWING GRIND OF THUNDER
AND WILL REQUIRE YOUR HELP ENCOURAGEMENT AND SILENCE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD AND MISTER FINNEY LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT CHRIS
HE CHUCKLED THE TWO WENT ON MAKING SLOW PROGRESS FOR THE RIVER WAS DEEP AT THAT POINT WITH LITTLE FOOTHOLD BETWEEN THE END OF THE JUNGLE OF REEDS AND DEEP WATER KEEP AN EYE OUT AMOS CHRIS CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE WENT AHEAD
AT ONCE THE FOLDED OBJECT BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF AND TO PUFF ITSELF UP LIKE A LITTLE MUSHROOM IN A MATTER OF SECONDS CHRIS COULD SEE WHAT IT WAS BECOMING AND BEFORE HE COULD WINK TEN TIMES A BALLOON WITH A BASKET HANGING FROM IT
WHICH ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE CAPTURED THIS OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY'S OWN PRIZE MADE HIM CROW WITH DELIGHT CLAMBERING AS GRACEFULLY AS POSSIBLE OVER THE BATTLE SCARRED SIDE OF THE VULTURE HE TOOK THE PARAKEET GENTLY OUT FROM UNDER HIS TRICORNE
TOO PRECIPITOUS ON WHICH TO BUILD HOUSES IT ROSE FAR ABOVE THE SURROUNDING ROOFS OF PEKING THE GREEN AND SCARLET OF CURVED TILES SPREAD UNDER THE BOYS SIGHT LIKE A CURLING SEA
BEFORE LEAVING FOR A NEW DOMAIN SHE WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THE JEWEL TREE WITH HER I CAN'T IMAGINE A WOMAN LEAVING A THING LIKE THAT BEHIND HE PAUSED REMEMBERING SHE HELD A SPRAY OF JEWELED FLOWERS IN HER HAND MAYBE OFF THE TREE
AND HE KNEW HE MUST DO IT AND AT ONCE THE BOY LOOKED A LAST TIME AROUND THE CABIN THEN SPOKE THE MAGIC FORMULA IN HIS MIND AND WITH A SUDDEN ENJOYMENT IN THE SENSE OF FLIGHT HE SOARED AWAY FROM THE SHIP
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
ITS BACK VERY INSECURE TO LOOK AT IN SHORT CHRIS KNEW IT WAS A TOTAL FAILURE HE TRIED AGAIN RACING AGAINST THE ONCOMING DARKNESS AND THIS TIME HE SUCCEEDED ALTHOUGH WHEN HE PULLED IT CLOSE AND STRADDLED THE BODY OF THE MAGIC BIRD
AND BOUND IN HEAVY BRASS STUDDED WITH SEMI PRECIOUS STONES IN THE FORM OF SIGNS AND SYMBOLS WITH DIFFICULTY STANDING ON TIPTOE CHRIS LIFTED IT DOWN AND PLACING IT ON THE FLOOR TURNED OVER PAGE AFTER PAGE
HE STRODE OVER TO THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT TO HIS GARDENS AND THE TREES WHERE THE APPLES SHOWED THEIR RUSSET CHEEKS LEAVE ME THESE CHARTS FOR YET A LITTLE WHILE AND I SHALL PONDER ON OUR PLANS SAID MISTER WICKER
CLAGGETT CHEW TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY HIS EYES BLAZING WITH RAGE AND HIS MOUTH WORKING WITH THE FRETFUL ANNOYANCE OF AN ILL MAN BUT HE ONLY MUTTERED AND TURNED AWAY AGAIN
THE JEWEL TREE OF THE PRINCESS OF CHINA NOW LIKE A GENERAL PLANNING HIS CAMPAIGN CHRIS LAY LOOKING DOWN AT THE HIGH ANGULAR WALLS THINKING OF HOW HE WOULD GAIN ENTRY ON REGAINING THE MIRABELLE IN A BOAT MADE FROM THE MAGIC ROPE
AND SAW STILL OTHER CREWMEN DISAPPEARING WITH THEIR BURDENS DOWN THE HOLD THEN SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HE EXAMINED THE NAME ALONG THE SIDE THROUGH THE SPYGLASS
BY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUN AND THE HEAT THAT SEEPED EVEN THROUGH THE BOARDS OF THE SHIP CHRIS JUDGED THAT THE MORNING WAS WELL ADVANCED DRESSING WAS RAPID FOR CHRIS LIKE THE REST OF THE SAILORS IN THE TROPIC HEAT WORE ONLY HIS BREECHES
AND WHEN HE REACHED THE BRIDGE HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE FRUITS FROM THE ISLAND PILED IN SHADY CORNERS THESE AND BREAD AND CHEESE MADE UP HIS MEAL WHICH HE ATE WHILE WATCHING THE FINAL LEAVES AND FRONDS PUT IN PLACE ON THE SIDES OF THE MIRABELLE
HIS FRIEND THOUGHT BUT WHEN NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION
WHICH SPLINTERED ON THE FLOOR WATCHING THERE IN THE DARKNESS HE SHOOK SO WITH NERVES THAT HE HAD TO KNEEL FOR IN THE BLACKNESS LIT ONLY BY THE LIGHTNING AND ITS OWN EERIE GLOW THE WOOD WAS CHANGING AS HE WATCHED IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
IT IS NOT PROPER THAT HE SHOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT EVEN A TOKEN OF RESPECT HE GESTURED WITH HIS PLUMP HAND TO THE BIBLE DO YOU SETTLE AMONG YOURSELVES WHO SHALL DO THE READING
STAGGERED ABOUT AIMLESSLY GORGING FOOD AND DRINKING THE WATCHING PAGANS GLANCED FROM THE BRAWLING PIRATES BACK A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE BEACH WHERE ALREADY A FEW BODIES HAD BEEN WASHED ASHORE FROM THE FIGHT THEIR DISTASTE AND BEWILDERMENT WERE PLAIN
THEN THEY REALIZED BY THE GROWING CROWD ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PALACE GATE AND ALONG THE NARROW STREET LEADING AWAY FROM IT THAT SOMEONE OF IMPORTANCE WAS ABOUT TO COME FROM THE PALACE AND PARADE THROUGH THE STREETS OF PEKING WONDER WHAT GOES ON
THE SAILORS FROM THE MIRABELLE WERE EVERYWHERE IN THE THICKETS FOR THE SHADE AS WELL AS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE COVE WHERE HE NOW STOOD INDECISIVE TO USE THE ROPE WAS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BEACH WAS BROAD AND CHRIS WAS ACUTELY AWARE THAT HE STOOD OUT LIKE A SINGLE TREE IN A FIELD
THIS AFTERNOON A RAINY ONE
TERRIFIED AND DESPAIRING AND OUT OVER THE WATER FOLLOWING IT CAME A LOW SCATTERED RUMBLE SILENCE FELL FOR SEVERAL FROZEN SECONDS AND THEN ALL AT ONCE CHRIS BECAME AWARE AS HE STOOD RIGID WITH HORROR BY THE BOAT
HIS BARE CHEST AND SHOULDERS WERE TANNED AND HEALTHY
NEWS OF SAILINGS AND DESTINATIONS GET ABOUT SO RAPIDLY IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT SOMEONE OVERHEARD THE DESTINATION OF THE MIRABELLE AND SOLD HIS KNOWLEDGE TO CAPTAIN CHEW ALTHOUGH HE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY I THINK
ALL THOSE PIGTAILED GENTLEMEN DRESSED IN EMBROIDERED COATS I LIKE THAT BLUE ONE WITH BUTTERFLIES ON IT NO I'D SOONER HAVE THE BLACK SATIN ONE WITH THE DRAGON IN RED AND YELLOW HE LOOKED AGAIN MORE CLOSELY OR THE ONE WITH THE PEACOCK IN GREEN AND PURPLE
HATE TO BE A DIGNITARY IN ALL THIS HEAT AMOS SAID UNENVIOUSLY WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW HE ENQUIRED AND BOTH BOYS PARTED THE PRICKLY PINE NEEDLES TO LOOK OUT AND DOWN
AND AMOS'S LAUGHTER AND WILLING HAPPY NATURE SOON MADE BECKY SPOIL HIM AS MUCH AS SHE DID CHRIS ANOTHER COT WAS PUT INTO CHRIS'S ROOM AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THEY WOULD HANG OUT THE TWO MANSARD WINDOWS WATCHING WHAT WENT ON BELOW UNTIL IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE
AND IN AN EMPTY VIAL POURED FIRST TWO DROPS OF THIS AND THEN SEVENTEEN OF THAT AND RAN TO HEAT IT AT THE FIRE MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED
AND THE BYSTANDERS STILL OTHERS LED LEOPARDS AND BLACK PANTHERS ON CHAINS AS AN ADDED PROTECTION TO THOSE THEY GUARDED PALANQUIN AFTER PALANQUIN PASSED BY
HOW SOON CAN THE MIRABELLE PUT TO SEA MISTER WICKER ASKED AND CHRIS'S HEART SKIPPED A BEAT AT ANY TIME SIR THE CAPTAIN AT ONCE REPLIED WE HAVE NEARLY WATER ENOUGH AND QUITE SUFFICIENT STORES THE MEN ARE ALL ASSEMBLED
NO HE SAID AFTER A LONG MOMENT BETTER NOT BUT I'D SURE LIKE TO AMOS NOW DON'T LOSE THAT PACKAGE IT'S YOUR ESCAPE WISH ME LUCK AMOS CLASPED HIS HAND AND THEN RUSHING OFF DASHED BACK AGAIN HERE CHRIS
IS LAW FOR ELISHA FINNEY AND CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
AS HE LOOKED FOR WHAT HE WANTED TO FIND AT LAST THE VERY FRAGRANCE RISING UP TOWARD HIM ON THE NIGHT AIR GUIDED HIM TO A LARGE PALACE SET IN GARDENS POOLS OF WATER REFLECTED THE FIRST STARS AMONG THEIR LILYPADS
AND THEN HE WONDERED WHO ZACHARY WAS LOOKING AT FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE CHRIS TURNED HIS HEAD AND DID NOT HAVE TO HEAR THE NAME MUTTERED BY CILLEY OR BY BOWIE AT HIS BACK
NED CILLEY BEAMED ON THEM AND LEANED BACK ON HIS HEELS FOR A BETTER VIEW
CHRIS PUT DOWN HIS SPYGLASS AND THE TWO BOYS HIDDEN ON THE PINY KNOLL WATCHED THE PROCESSION OUT OF SIGHT I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM HER CHRIS SAID WITH HIS EYES SPARKLING BUT I KNOW NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO GIVE HER BACK IN RETURN
LEAVE THE LADS NO SIGHT FOR YOUNG UNS PULL YOU LAZY LUBBERS
THE CAPTAIN WITH SURPRISING BRISKNESS FOR SO LARGE A MAN PULLED SOME FOLDED CHARTS FROM HIS POCKET
WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK GESTURES MISTER WICKER REACHED DOWN FOR THE ROPE AND WAS UP AND OUT OF HIS CHAIR ALL IN ONE MOVEMENT YOU SHALL LEARN LAST OF YOUR LESSONS A NEW WAY OF USING A LASSO NOT LASSOING MISTER WICKER HELD UP A FINGER TO STRESS HIS POINT
CHRIS BREATHED THAT COLOR YELLOW IS THE ROYAL COLOR OF CHINA HE DID NOT HAVE TO ELABORATE HIS THOUGHT FOR THE PALANQUIN THAT FINALLY CAME IN SIGHT SHOWED BY ITS RICHNESS THAT IT COULD BELONG ONLY TO ROYALTY AND BY ITS BEAUTY AND GRACE
AND NOW THEY HAVE THE GATES OPEN LOOK AT THE DEPTH OF THE WALLS THEY'RE AS DEEP THROUGH AS A ROOM THE WAITING PROCESSION THE RICHLY DRESSED COURTIERS AND CURTAINED PALANQUIN MOVED INSIDE AND THE GATES WERE SLOWLY PULLED CLOSE BY LINES OF MEN
THAT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE HAD RUSHED OUT FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE SHORE TO STAND STIFF AND APPALLED BESIDE HIM A BABBLE OF VOICES BROKE OUT AND ONE BY ONE THE BOATS WERE HASTILY LAUNCHED HEADING BACK TO THE SHIP
BUT WHEN CHRIS ATTEMPTED TO TALK OF THE JEWEL TREE THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS HIS LIPS BUT REMAINED IN HIS MOUTH LIKE A HANDFUL OF MARBLES GOOD SAID MISTER WICKER RUBBING HIS HANDS NOT EVEN TO ME
RISING HIGHER AS IT WENT BELOW THE FEW LIGHTS OF THE SHIP HAD BEEN CAREFULLY HOODED AWAY FROM THE SEA
BECKY BOOZER'S HUGE FRAME BLOCKED IT BEHIND THEM AS SHE STOOD IN THE SUN TO SEE THEM OFF EACH BOY HAD BEEN GIVEN MEAT AND BREAD SOME CAKES AND APPLES FOR THEIR MIDDAY MEAL AND CHRIS STOOD LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET FOR A MOMENT BEFORE STARTING
CHRIS PUT THE OBJECT DOWN AND SAID STRIKE THREE NOTHING HAPPENED THE OBJECT REMAINED AN OBJECT THEN SUDDENLY UNDERSTANDING CHRIS STRUCK THE STONE LEDGE THREE TIMES
BELOW A TIGHT ROUND PAUNCH TWO SMALL FEET LOOKING RATHER LIKE MICE WENT IN AND OUT AS HE WALKED THE ROUNDNESS OF HIS FACE WAS UNDERLINED BY THREE FOLDS OF CHIN
THE TWO BOYS WERE UNINTERESTED IN TITLES SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT CITY WITHIN A CITY INSIDE THE ENORMOUS SPREAD OF THE PALACE WALLS THAT WERE SURROUNDED IN THEIR TURN BY THE CITY OF PEKING LAY THE GOAL THEY HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK
THE EXTRAORDINARY PAIR CAME IN AND CHRIS WAS INTRODUCED TO CAPTAIN BLIZZARD AND MISTER FINNEY THE CAPTAIN WAS ALL SMILES EXCEPT FOR HIS EYES CHRIS NOTED THAT HIS EYES DID NOT SMILE AT ALL
CHRIS WAS SO STARTLED AT HIS USUALLY GENTLE MASTER'S TONE THAT WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT OR EFFORT ON HIS PART HE BEGAN INTONING TO HIMSELF THE WORDS AND SOUNDS OF INCANTATION SEVENTY THREE BOOK ONE AS HE WENT ON
GO AND FEEL OF IT CHRISTOPHER MISTER WICKER URGED CLIMB IN IT IF YOU LIKE I HAVE LEFT THE TWO ENDS OF THE ROPE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE OARS IF NECESSARY CHRIS RAN OVER AND FELT THE SIDES OF THE BOAT IT WAS SOUND AND SECURE NO DOUBT OF THAT
AMOS NEED NOT HAVE BEEN SO CONCERNED FOR CHRIS HAD A GOOD PLAN BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE HEAT OVERCAME CHRIS PUTTING HIS HEAD DOWN ON HIS ARMS HE SLEPT AMOS SLEPT TOO
MISTER WICKER GAVE A CHUCKLE INDEED WELL LET ME TELL YOU MY BOY NO ONE ELSE DOES EITHER THE ROPE IS MADE TO GO UP IN THE AIR SO STIFFLY THAT THE FAKIR THAT IS THE EASTERN MAGICIAN CAN CLIMB IT
LET ME HOPE WILL FOLLOW THE CONSERVATIVE POLICY OF YOUR HONORED UNCLE AND I SAY I MUST THINK IT OVER MAY I NOT HAVE A DAY A SINGLE DAY IN WHICH TO MOURN THE LOSS OF MY SPLENDID BROTHER
FOR HE WAS NOT AWAKENED BY A CRACKLING OF THE BRUSH AND SCRAMBLING OF FEET STRUGGLING UP THE MOUNTAIN WALL BELOW HIS HARD RESTING PLACE YET THE SOUND KEPT ON AND SOON A HEAD APPEARED ABOVE THE ROCK AND TWO HANDS WERE PLACED UPON IT
WELL DAVID YOU DON'T SEEM SATISFIED IS IT WITH MY CONDITION YOUR CONDITION NO NO NO IT'S NOT YOUR CONDITION YES YES FINE FINE I NEVER SAW SUCH A MARVELLOUS CHANGE IN MY LIFE NEVER
OR THE HOPE HER WORDS HELD OUT AGAIN THE LAUGH NEARER THIS TIME AND AGAIN THE WILD LOOK OF HAUNTING FEAR IN HIS FACE HE DROPPED WHERE HE STOOD AND SLIPPED STEALTHILY AS A CAT BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LAIN
UNTIL I CAME DOWN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS WITH THEM HER HER FATHER WHY HE'S DEAD HE
BETTER THAN I COULD DAVID LIFTED HIS EYES TO HIS OLD FRIEND'S THEN TURNED THEM AWAY I FEEL HIM TO BE A SACRED TRUST AGAIN HE PAUSED IT WOULD TAKE A
I DONE BRUNG HIM DOWN AN LEF HIM IN YOUR SHED AN I LOWED P'RHAPS UNCLE JERRY'D TAKE HIM OVAH TO HIS PAW AGAIN HE SWALLOWED AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY THE CRITTER'D STARVE UP YANDER ANYHOW I AIN'T HOSS STEALIN
THEN TURNED AND GAZED AGAIN AT THE LIFE SIZE HALF LENGTH PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN WITH SUNNY HAIR LIKE DAVID'S AND WARM BROWN EYES
WHEN YOU COMIN BACK BROTHAH DAVID DOES IT HURT YOU VERY MUCH HOYLE I RECKON HIT HAVE TO HURT SAID THE CHILD WITH FATALISTIC RESIGNATION I DON'T GUESS HE'D HURT ME THOUT HE HAD TO
AND SHOOK HANDS WITH ANOTHER OLD GENTLEMAN
AT LAST IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD SAIL FOR ENGLAND WITHOUT DELAY TAKING THE PASSAGE ALREADY PROVISIONALLY ENGAGED FOR HIM BY MISTER STRETTON I CAN WRITE TO CASSANDRA SHE WILL UNDERSTAND MORE EASILY THAN MY MOTHER
SHE FOLLOWED SLOWLY IN THE OLD MAN'S WAKE NEVER OPENING HER LIPS UNTIL THEY HAD MADE THE CIRCUIT AND WERE AGAIN STANDING BEFORE THE PORTRAIT OF THE FAIR HAIRED YOUTH
ALL EYES AND HAIR ALL SOUL AND MIND
THEN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HAVE SNOW YESTERDAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW THRYNG'S BREAKFAST WAS SERVED TO HIM AS HAD BEEN HIS SUPPER OF THE EVENING BEFORE DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRE
ABOVE HIS HEAD LAID UPON CROSS BEAMS WERE BUNDLES OF WOOL UNCARDED AND CARDING BOARDS HUNG FROM NAILS IN THE LOGS IN ONE CORNER WAS A RUDELY CONSTRUCTED REEL AND FROM THE LOOM DANGLED THE IDLE SHUTTLE FILLED WITH FINE BLUE YARN OF WOOL
AND THE PALER TINTS OF FEATHERY PINES HERE AND THERE FROM DAMP SPRINGY PLACES DARK HEMLOCKS ROSE OUT OF THE MASS
DAVID SHIVERED AND BUTTONED HIS LIGHT OVERCOAT CLOSER ABOUT HIM COLD SAID THE OLDER MAN
HIT DO MAKE ME CLAR PLUMB MAD WHEN I THINK HOW YOU HEV ACTED JES LIKE YOU PAW EF HE'D NEVAH A STARTED THAT THAR STILL YOU'D NEVAH A BEEN WHAT YE BE NOW A DRINKIN YER OWN WHISKEY AT THAT COME ON HOME WITH ME I RECKON I'M BETTAH HYAR
NOW THEY WERE DISMOUNTING AND QUESTIONING THE BOY NOW THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE HOUSE HE DID NOT MOVE WHY WERE THEY SO LONG WITHIN HOURS IT SEEMED TO FRALE BUT IN REALITY IT WAS ONLY A SHORT SEARCH THEY WERE MAKING THERE THEY WERE LONGER LOOKING ABOUT THE SHEDS AND YARD
HE CLIMBED RAPIDLY UP THROUGH THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND STOOD AT HER SIDE BREATHING QUICKLY FOR A MOMENT THEY WAITED THUS REGARDING EACH OTHER NEITHER SPEAKING THE BOY HE SEEMED LITTLE MORE THAN A YOUTH
AND ANY FLING AT HER SONS IS A BLOW TO HER BUT WHAT I SAY I COULDN'T TELL HER I TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN DRINKING FROM THE CUP OF HAPPINESS I HAVE DRAINED IT TO THE LAST DROP MY WIFE IS MINE
UNTIL GRADUALLY THIS HALF WAKE DREAMING REMINISCENCE CONCENTRATED UPON HER AND AGAIN HE SAW HER STANDING HOLDING THE CANDLE HIGH AND LOOKING UP AT HIM A WONDERING QUESTIONING SPIRIT THEN DROOPING WEARILY INTO THE CHAIR BY THE UNCLEARED TABLE
LIST'NIN TO ALL WE SAY FRALE COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE WORDS BUT HIS FACE BURNED RED WITH RAGE HAD HE BEEN IN HIDING DOWN BELOW HE WOULD HAVE WREAKED VENGEANCE ON THE MAN AS IT WAS
HE PEERED MORE EAGERLY DOWN AND SAW LITTLE HOYLE RUN OUT OF THE COW SHED AND TWIST HIMSELF THIS WAY AND THAT TO SEE UP AND DOWN THE ROAD BOTH THE CHILD AND THE DOG SEEMED EXCITED YES THERE THEY WERE THREE HORSEMEN COMING ALONG THE HIGHWAY
AND A BOTTLE OF MILK NOTHING BETTER NEED A MAN ASK AND WHAT ANIMALS MEN ARE AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT TAKING DELIGHT IN THE MERE ACTS OF EATING AND BREATHING AND SLEEPING UTTERLY WEARY HE WOULD NOT TROUBLE TO OPEN THE COT WHICH LAY IN THE CABIN
HE CREPT BENEATH THEM AND LAY STILL
FOR HER YES YES BUT YOUR UNCLE YOU KNOW DIED OF GRIEF AND YOUR M MOTHER I KNOW SO THE LAWYER SAID NOW AT LAST WE'LL READ MOTHER'S LETTER
SHE LEANED DOWN TO HIM AND HELD HIM BY THE COAT AN INSTANT SON LEAVE WHISKEY ALONE HIT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU KIN DO TO GET HER YAS AUNT SALLY HE MURMURED HIS EYES THANKED HER WITH ONE LOOK FOR THE TONE
ALL THAT THE OLD DOCTOR DID WAS WELL AND THOROUGHLY DONE HIS APPETITE SHARPENED BY THE CLIMB AND THE BRACING AIR DAVID INVESTIGATED THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THOSE MELON SHAPED BASKETS WHICH CASSANDRA HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN HE STARTED FOR HIS NEW HOME THAT MORNING
HAD HE EVER SEEN THE MAN BEFORE HE REALLY DID NOT KNOW THEY REACHED THE HOTEL SHORTLY AND WERE CONDUCTED TO MISTER STRETTON'S PRIVATE APARTMENT WHERE WINE WAS ORDERED AND PROMPTLY SERVED FOR YEARS THEREAFTER
THAT HE MIGHT GO IN AND DO WHAT HE COULD TO HELP THE PATIENT IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH RETURN FOR THE KINDNESS SHOWN HIM HE FEARED TO OFFER MONEY FOR HIS LODGMENT AT LEAST UNTIL HE COULD FIND A WAY AT LAST FULL OF NEW VIGOR AND VERY HUNGRY
ONE OF WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OPEN AND THE CONTENTS PLACED IN A THICK LAYER OVER THE LONG BENCH ON WHICH HE HAD SLEPT AND COVERED WITH A BLUE AND WHITE HOMESPUN COUNTERPANE THE HEAD HAD BEEN BUILT HIGH WITH IT AND SHEETS SPREAD OVER ALL
ALTHOUGH DAZED AND BAFFLED CASSANDRA BETRAYED NO SIGN OF THE TUMULT WITHIN AND THE LITTLE OLD MAN STOOD BEFORE HER HESITATING HIS CURIOSITY PIQUED INTO A DETERMINATION TO DISCOVER HER BUSINESS AND IDENTITY
DAVID SMILED AS HE BENT HIMSELF TO THE REFRESHING TASK OF BATHING IN WATER SO COLD AS TO BE REALLY ICY INDEED ICE HAD FORMED OVER STILL POOLS WITHOUT DURING THE NIGHT ALTHOUGH NOW FAST DISAPPEARING UNDER THE GLOWING MORNING SUN
SHE SEES INTO THE HEART OF THINGS HER THOUGHTS GO TO THE TRUTH LIKE ARROWS OF LIGHT SHE WILL SEE THAT I MUST GO BUT SHE MUST NEVER KNOW I MUST SAVE HER FROM IT IF I HAVE TO DO SO AT THE EXPENSE OF MY OWN SOUL
SHE HEAPED HIM ABOUT WITH PILLOWS AND BEDCLOTHING TO MAKE A NEST FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM A SPOON AND A DRINKING CUP FOR ENTERTAINMENT
AND SHOULD HE WAIT OH YES WAIT CRIED CASSANDRA WHAT IF DAVID WERE NOT THERE AND OF COURSE HE MIGHT BE OUT THEN THEY WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THE DARK INTERIOR
AND THE LARGE COFFEE POT STOOD ON THE HEARTH THE ODOR OF BREAKFAST WAS SAVORY AND APPETIZING AS DAVID'S TALL FORM CAST A SHADOW ACROSS THE SUNLIT SPACE ON THE FLOOR THE OLD MOTHER'S VOICE CALLED TO HIM FROM THE CORNER
HE ISSUED FROM HIS SLEEPING ROOM SADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE BUT BIDING HIS TIME SATISFIED IF ONLY BREAKFAST MIGHT BE FORTHCOMING HE HAD NO NEED TO KNOCK FOR THE HOUSE DOOR STOOD OPEN FLOODING THE PLACE WITH SUNLIGHT AND FROSTY AIR
DAVID GATHERED THEM UP AND GAVE THEM TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS THE OLD DOCTOR STOOD BESIDE THE COT AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LITTLE ARTIST HIS LIPS TWITCHED AND HIS EYES TWINKLED
I DON'T GUESS HIT'S A VERY GOOD'N SAID THE CHILD RUEFULLY CLINGING TO THE SCRAP OF PAPER WITH RELUCTANT GRASP YOU RECKON SHE'D KEER FER THIS'N I RECKON SHE'D CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU MADE
AS HE FORCED A PATH THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A MOUNTAIN STREAM AND SEEKING IT HE FOLLOWED ALONG ITS ROCKY BED LEAPING FROM ONE HUGE BLOCK OF STONE TO ANOTHER AND SWINGING HIMSELF ACROSS BY GREAT OVERHANGING SYCAMORE BOUGHS
WOULD GOD HE HAD LIVED TO FILL THIS PLACE HE SAID DESPERATELY THE LAWYER BOWED DEFERENTIALLY AND DOCTOR HOYLE TOOK DAVID'S ARM AND LED HIM AWAY AS IF HE WERE HIS SON NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN BY EITHER OF THEM
SLUNG OVER THE HORSE'S BACK BEHIND HER AND WITH CONTENTMENT IN HER HEART
HE STOOD UP AND BOLDLY WATCHED THEM RIDE AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME HE SANK BACK AND WAITED AND AGAIN THE HOURS PASSED ALL WAS STILL BUT THE RUSHING WATER AND THE GENTLE SOUGHING OF THE WIND IN THE TOPS OF THE TOWERING PINES
IT'S A PILE OF S SAUSAGES HIT HAIN'T NO SAUSAGES HIT'S JEST A STRAIGHT
FOR THE CLIMB HAD TAKEN MORE STRENGTH THAN HE COULD WELL SPARE HIS CABIN WAS NOT YET HABITABLE FOR THE SIMPLE THINGS DOCTOR HOYLE HAD ACCUMULATED TO SERVE HIS NEEDS WERE STILL LOCKED IN WELL BUILT CUPBOARDS AS HE HAD LEFT THEM
AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GET WONTED TO A NEW ONE HE GRAVELY LAID THE OLD ONE WITHIN EASY REACH OF HIS ARM AND RESTORED THE NEW ONE TO ITS BOX THEN HE SAT HIMSELF NEAR DAVID AND PLACED HIS HAND KINDLY ON HIS KNEE
THROWING DANCING FLECKS OF LIGHT AND THE WINE IN THEM WHY DID IT MAKE HIM THINK OF BLOOD WERE THEY DEAD THEN ALL THREE HIS TWO COUSINS AND HIS BROTHER DEAD SHOT
THE SOLDIERS THE GUARDSMEN THE LIVERIED LACKEYS THE ERRAND BOYS ALL WERE THERE AND THE LADIES IN FINE CARRIAGES THERE WERE THE NURSEMAIDS THE BABIES THE BEGGARS THE RAGGED URCHINS AND THE VENDERS OF THE STREET
WAS HE CALLED HOME BY HIS MOTHER TO HELP HER SUSTAIN A NEW CALAMITY HAD THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENED MISTER STRETTON'S MANNER CONTINUED TO BE MYSTERIOUSLY DEFERENTIAL TOWARD HIM AND SOMETHING IN HIS AIR REMINDED DAVID OF ENGLAND
THE STONES FALLING ABOUT HIM CAUSED HIM TO RAISE HIMSELF STEALTHILY AND PEER UPWARD DESCRYING ONLY THE LONE WOMAN AND THE GRAY HORSE HE GAVE A LOW PECULIAR CRY ALMOST LIKE THAT OF AN ANIMAL IN DISTRESS SHE DREW REIN SHARPLY AND LISTENED
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING FOR MY BRAVE LITTLE BROTHER
SHE STEPPED QUICKLY OUT AND GAINED HER SEAT ON THE HIGH NARROW SADDLE WITH THE EASE OF A YOUNG GIRL MEAGRE AS A WILLOW WITHE IN HER SCANT BLACK COTTON GOWN PERCHED ON HER BONY GRAY BEAST
CASSANDRA HAD RETURNED AND HER GRATUITOUS NEIGHBORLY OFFICES WERE AT AN END THE GIRL WAS STOOPING BEFORE THE FIRE ARRANGING A CAKE OF CORN BREAD TO COOK IN THE ASHES A CRANE SWUNG OVER THE FLAMES ON WHICH A FAT IRON KETTLE WAS HUNG
THE CRY WAS REPEATED A LITTLE LOUDER
SHE'S THAT BAD HURTED PAW AN I WE GOT HER TO BED
YES I'M A STRANGER SHE CAUGHT AT THE WORD SEIZED BY AN INWARD TERROR OF THE SMALL EYES FIXED CURIOUSLY ON HER SHE INTUITIVELY SHRANK FROM BETRAYING HER IDENTITY AND THE OLD SERVANT HAD TOLD HER WHAT SHE NEEDED TO KNOW
AND THEY WERE RATTLED AWAY OVER THE ROUGH PAVING A LONG LONELY RIDE THROUGH THE WONDERFUL CITY SO MANY MILES OF HOUSES AND SPLENDID BUILDINGS OF GARDENS AND MONUMENTS STRANGELY THE PEOPLE OF VANITY FAIR LEAPED OUT OF THE BOOK SHE HAD READ
NEITHER OF THEM MUST BE MADE TO SUFFER THAT'S RIGHT PERFECTLY BUT DON'T WAIT TOO LONG JUST HAVE IT OUT WITH YOUR MOTHER ALL OF THEM
THEN BETWEEN HIM AND THE BLAZING LIGHT CAME A DARK FIGURE SILHOUETTED BLACKLY AGAINST IT MOVING STOOPING RISING GOING AND COMING A SWEET GIRL'S HEAD WITH HEAVILY COILED HAIR THROUGH WHICH THE FIRELIGHT PLAYED WITH FLASHES OF ITS OWN COLOR
WHAT IF THE LITTLE CREATURE SHOULD SEEK HIM OUT AND BETRAY HIM HE QUIVERED WITH THE THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD DRIVEN HIM DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BEATING HIM OFF WHENEVER HE RETURNED SHOULD THE ANIMAL PERSIST IN TRACKING HIM HE WOULD KILL HIM
IT WAS NOT THAT THE MONEY HAD BEEN MADE IN COMMERCE HE WAS NEITHER A SNOB NOR A CAD ALTHOUGH HIS OWN CONNECTIONS ENTITLED HIM TO HONOR WHAT MORE COULD HE EXPECT THAN TO MARRY WEALTH AND BE HAPPY IF IF HAPPINESS COULD COME TO EITHER OF THEM IN THAT WAY
AND REAL BLUE FOR THE SKY AND THE SEA THE CHILD'S EYES GLOWED HE PULLED DAVID DOWN AND HELD HIM WITH HIS ARM ABOUT HIS NECK AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR AND WHAT HE SAID WAS
FRALE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AND STRAINED EAGERLY FORWARD IF YOU ARE SUCH A COWARD YOU MUST HIT SOMETHING SMALL AND WEAK YOU CAN STRIKE A WOMAN HIT ME SHE PANTED PUTTING THE CHILD BEHIND HER MUTTERING THE MAN RODE SULLENLY AWAY
THEN BREAKING OFF A BIT OF THE ROOT SHE CHEWED IT WHILE SHE THRUST THE REST IN HER BAG AND USED THE TOP FOR A SWITCH WITH WHICH TO HASTEN THE PACE OF HER NAG THE SMALL STONES LOOSENED WHEN SHE TORE THE SHRUB FROM THE BANK RATTLED DOWN WHERE THE SOIL HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY
NO IT WAS NOT THE HOUSE IT WAS AGAIN SHE WAITED NOT KNOWING HOW TO INTRODUCE HER HUSBAND'S NAME A MYSTERY A VISITOR AT THIS HOUR AND SEEMINGLY A LADY
HIS BRIDLE HANGING FROM HIS NECK THE BIT DANGLING WHILE HE ALSO MADE HIS REPAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS CORN AND SHE HAD FINISHED HER ELABORATE FAREWELLS AT THE BEDSIDE AND LITTLE HOYLE HAD WITH MUCH EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN BRIDLING HER STEED
FOR IM TO LOOK SO LIKE BEING AS E BELONGED TO THE YOUNGER BRANCH WHO AVEN'T ELD THE TITLE FOR FOUR GENERATIONS BUT COME TO DRESS IM IN VELVET AND GOLD LACE AND THE LIKENESS WOULD BE NIGH AS PERFECT AS IF E AD STOOD FOR IT
THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY HEARD HIS BARK OF JOY AND THEN THEY WOULD SEIZE HIM HE CREPT CLOSE TO THE ROCK WHERE THE WATER RUSHED NOT A FOOT AWAY AND CLINGING TO THE TOUGH LAUREL BEHIND HIM LEANED FAR OVER
FRALE SAW ONE OF THE MEN TURN AS HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE TO RIDE AWAY AND CUT THE BOY CRUELLY ACROSS HIS FACE AND ARM WITH HIS RAWHIDE WHIP THE LITTLE ONE'S SHRIEK OF FRIGHT AND PAIN PIERCED HIS BIG BROTHER TO THE HEART AND CAUSED HIM TO FORGET FOR THE MOMENT HIS OWN ABJECT FEAR
KILLED IN A BLOODY AND USELESS WAR HE WAS CONFOUNDED AND BOWING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS SAT THUS HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES WAITING HEARING BUT NOT COMPREHENDING
HE WOULD TAKE HIM IN HIS ARMS HE WOULD HOLD THEM BOTH TO HIS HEART SHE WOULD SEE HIM SMILE AGAIN AND LOOK IN HIS EYES AND ALL THIS FOREBODING WOULD CEASE AND THE WOFUL SOUNDS DIE OUT OF THE AIR AND BECOME ONLY THE NATURAL ROAR OF THE ACTIVITIES AND TRAFFIC OF A GREAT CITY
THE HUGE PILE OF LOGS WAS BLAZING ON THE HEARTH AS IF IT HAD NEVER CEASED SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE FLAMES LEAPED HOT AND RED UP THE GREAT CHIMNEY OLD SALLY NO LONGER PRESIDED AT THE COOKERY
WHICH FELL SHEER DOWN UNTIL LOST IN PURPLE SHADOW WITH A MANTLE OF GREEN DEEP AND RICH VARIED BY THE GRAY OF THE LICHEN COVERED ROCKS THE BROWNS AND REDS OF THE BARE BRANCHES OF DECIDUOUS TREES
CRIED THE YOUNGER MAN DESPERATELY I COULD NEVER IN THE WORLD MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND ME OR MY MOTIVES I GAVE IT UP LONG AGO I'VE NOT TOLD MY MOTHER TO SAVE HER FROM A NEEDLESS SORROW THAT WOULD BE INFLICTED ON HER BY HER FRIENDS
GIANT FOREST TREES INTERTWINED AND ALMOST OVERGROWN BY A TANGLE OF WILD GRAPEVINES HID THE FALL FROM SIGHT AND BEHIND THEM THE MOUNTAIN ROSE ABRUPTLY A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF CLEAREST WATER ICY COLD
AND A DELICATE PROFILE CUT IN PURE CLEAN LINES MELTING INTO THROAT AND GENTLY ROUNDED BREAST LIKE A SPIRIT NOW HERE NOW GONE AGAIN NEAR AND BENDING OVER HIM A MINISTERING SPIRIT BRINGING HIM FOOD
YET WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND ALONE AND NOT TO SEE THE HOUSE AGAIN HE COUGHED BEHIND HIS HAND
OVER HERE ON THIS SIDE YOU KNOW AH YES I HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN BUT SPEAKING OF TITLES I MUST GIVE THIS YOUNG MAN HIS CORRECTLY LORD THRYNG ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU MY LORD
AND THEREFORE HAD NEVER DESIRED NOW GIVEN HIM BY SO CRUEL A BLOW HE WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM WHATEVER DUTY
EVERYTHING IT'S THE DESTINY OF WOMEN TO LOVE US THANK GOD SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOOMED SURELY TO DIE IF SHE HAD MARRIED THE ONE WHO WANTED HER FIRST OR TO LIVE A LIFE FOR HER WORSE THAN DEATH OH LORD BLESS YOU BOY YES
THEY WOULD ALL FLOCK TO HER AND PESTER HER WITH THEIR OUTCRY OF HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY I CAN HEAR THEM AND SEE THEM NOW I TELL YOU IF A MAN STEPS OUT OF THE BEATEN TRACK OVER THERE IF HE ATTEMPTS TO ORDER HIS OWN LIFE MARRY TO PLEASE HIMSELF
OUGHT SHE THEN TO ARRIVE ATTENDED BY A MAID CARRYING HER BABY BUT DAVID WOULD KNOW SHE DID NOT NEED ONE BRINGING HIM HIS LITTLE SON IN HER OWN ARMS WHAT WOULD HE CARE FOR ANYTHING MORE SO THE ADDRESS WAS GIVEN THE CABMAN
UNFELT BY HER SO COMPLETELY WAS SHE PROTECTED BY THE THICKLY GROWING LAUREL AND RHODODENDRON ON EITHER SIDE OF HER PATH THE SNOW OF THE DAY BEFORE WAS GONE LEAVING ONLY THE GLISTENING WETNESS OF IT ON STONES AND FALLEN LEAVES AND TWIGS UNDERFOOT
BROODING THUS HE GAZED AT THE DISTANCE OF EVER PALING BLUE AND MECHANICALLY COUNTED THE RANGES AND PEAKS BELOW HIM AN INACCESSIBLE TANGLE OF LAUREL AND RHODODENDRON CLOTHED THE ROUGH AND PRECIPITOUS WALL OF THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
VERY OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO YOU OH NO NO I'M NOT THINKING OF ADAM BLESS YOU NO THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CALLED HIS LITTLE NAMESAKE ADAM I'M THINKING OF HER THE LITTLE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND YOU
OVER WHICH HUNG A DIPPER OF GOURD A WHITE PORCELAIN BASIN WAS PLACED ON THE CHAIR OVER WHICH A CLEAN TOWEL HAD BEEN SPREAD AND TO COMPLETE ALL A SQUARE CUT FROM THE END OF A BAR OF YELLOW SOAP LAY BESIDE THE BASIN
AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES NOW SO RUTHLESSLY THRUST UPON HIM OF HIS MOTHER'S GRIEF AND HIS OWN
WHAT ARE THESE MOUNDS HERE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SEA THEM'S MOUNTAINS BUT WHY DID YOU PUT MOUNTAINS IN THE SEA THE BOY LOOKED WITH WIDE EYES DREAMILY PAST THE TWO MEN SO ATTENTIVELY REGARDING HIM I
WE'LL LET IN A LITTLE MORE LIGHT A VANDYKE AND WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD CASSANDRA WATCHED HIM CROSS THE FLOOR HIS SHORT BOW LEGS REFLECTED GROTESQUELY IN ITS SHINING SURFACE AS HE WALKED
OR CUT HIS COAT AFTER ANY PATTERN OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY CONVENTIONAL LINES EVEN THE BOYS ON THE STREET WILL FLING STONES AT HIM HER PATRONIZING FRIENDS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST POLITELY RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS SHE IS PROUD AND SENSITIVE
SO THAT THE AIR AT VERY GREAT ALTITUDES HAS NOT THE SAME PROPORTION OF OXYGEN TO NITROGEN THAT IT HAS AT A LOWER LEVEL AN ANALYSIS THAT WAS MADE SOME YEARS AGO OF THE AIR ON THE WEST SHORE OF LAKE MICHIGAN ESPECIALLY THAT SECTION WHERE THE BLUFFS ARE HIGH
THE VALLEY OF THE OHIO RIVER WILL PROBABLY AVERAGE A MILE IN WIDTH AT ITS UPPER LEVEL AND DEEP AS IT IS TO DAY IT WAS MUCH DEEPER IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE WHOLE BED OF THE RIVER
AND WE HAVE THE PHENOMENON OF CLOUD FORMATION CLOUDS MORE GENERALLY FORM IN THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE IT IS NORMALLY COLDER IN THE HIGHER REGIONS IN SOME CASES CLOUDS FLOAT VERY HIGH IN THE AIR
AND NO ANIMAL LIFE UPON THE LAND SURFACE OF THE GLOBE EVAPORATION IS NATURE'S METHOD OF IRRIGATION AND THE SYSTEM IS INAUGURATED ON A GRAND SCALE SO THAT THERE ARE BUT FEW NEGLECTED SPOTS UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH WHICH MOISTURE
IF IT SHOULD CONTINUE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FORTUNATELY THE SHOCK DOES NOT LAST MORE THAN EIGHT OR TEN SECONDS WHEN IT IS FOLLOWED BY A PERFECT CALM IT IS AS THOUGH A GREAT VOLUME OF AIR HAD BEEN FIRED FROM SOME ENORMOUS CANNON FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE SEA
WHEN IT BENDS IN ITS COURSE AND MOVES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AROUND THIS CENTER BUT CONSTANTLY MOVING INWARD TOWARD IT IN A SPIRAL FORM AND IN A DIRECTION THAT IS REVERSE TO THAT OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK
THERE MAY HAVE EXISTED SOMETHING OF A LAKE IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN BUT IT UNDOUBTEDLY OWES ITS PRESENT WIDTH TO THE GRINDING ACTION OF THE IRRESISTIBLE ICEBERGS AND THE PILING UP OF DEBRIS ON THE SHORES
OR IT MAY FLOAT A LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IT MOVES FORWARD WITH A BOUNDING MOTION NOW TOUCHING THE EARTH AND NOW RISING IN THE AIR THIS CONE IS REVOLVING AT A TERRIFIC SPEED THE SUBSTANCE REVOLVING IS CHIEFLY AIR
NO RAIN WOULD EVER FALL AND NO WIND WOULD EVER BLOW IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE
IF WE STUDY THE AIR MOTIONS IN THESE SYSTEMS SUFFICIENTLY TO GET AT LEAST AN INKLING OF THE LAW OF THEIR MOVEMENTS IT BECOMES A VERY INTERESTING SUBJECT
THAT WE CALL IT WATER AND THEN IT IS HEAVIER THAN THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR AND THEREFORE SEEKS THE LOW PLACES UPON THE EARTH'S SURFACE THE LOWEST OF WHICH IS THE BED OF THE OCEAN WHEREVER THERE IS WATER OR MOISTURE ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
WE SHOULD FIND A MORE PERFECT VACUUM THAN CAN BE PRODUCED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE AIR ON THE GLOBE
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEAD CINDER FLOATING IN SPACE AND NOT SURROUNDED BY AN ATMOSPHERE SO THAT THE SUN'S RAYS HAVE FULL EFFECT UPON IT DURING THE TIME IT IS EXPOSED TO THEM
AIR TEMPERATURE THE MOST RECENT DEFINITION OF HEAT IS THAT IT IS A MODE OF MOTION NOT MOVEMENT OF A MASS OF SUBSTANCE
WE SHOULD HAVE A PERFECTLY CONSTANT CONDITION OF THINGS SUBJECTED ONLY TO SUCH GRADUAL CHANGES AS THE ADVANCING AND RECEDING SEASONS WOULD PRODUCE OWING TO THE CHANGE IN THE ANGLE OF THE SUN'S RAYS NO CLOUD WOULD EVER FORM
AND CAN BE RECKONED UPON FOR THE USE OF COMMERCE IF YOU TRACE THE LINE OF THE EQUATOR YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FOR MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF THE DISTANCE IT PASSES THROUGH THE WATER THE WATER AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED IN THE LAST CHAPTER BECOMES GRADUALLY HEATED TO A CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
COUPLED WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MODIFYING THE PHENOMENA OF AIR MOVEMENT THE VELOCITY OF WINDS AS THEY OCCUR FROM DAY TO DAY
DURING THE TIME THAT THE MOON IS IN THE EARTH'S SHADOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO FALL TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN DEGREES BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WHEN THE MOON IS FULL
ALL OF WHICH HELPS TO COMPLICATE ANY THEORY THAT MAY BE ADVANCED REGARDING CHANGES OF WEATHER ASIDE FROM THE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAT ARE DUE TO THE SEASONS WHICH ARE CAUSED BY THE OSCILLATING MOTION OF THE EARTH BETWEEN THE LIMITS OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER ON THE NORTH
IS SIMPLY A MIXTURE OF THESE TWO GASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A COMPOUND IN A MIXTURE THERE IS NO CHEMICAL CHANGE IN THE MOLECULES OF THE SUBSTANCES MIXED IN A COMPOUND
THE PERSPIRATION IS NOT READILY EVAPORATED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BODY IF THE AIR IS DRY THE TEMPERATURE MAY BE MUCH HIGHER AND WE BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE EVAPORATION GOES ON RAPIDLY WHICH KEEPS THE BODY NOT ONLY DRY BUT COOL
ON THE MARGIN OF THE TERMINAL MORAINE THESE LAKES HOWEVER ARE COMPARATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT AS COMPARED WITH THE GREAT INLAND SEAS LIKE LAKE SUPERIOR AND LAKE MICHIGAN THAT UNDOUBTEDLY OWE THEIR ORIGIN LARGELY TO THE ICE AGE
WHICH MEANS VARYING ITS WEIGHT THE BALLOON WILL FLOAT HIGHER OR LOWER AS THE INTERNAL CONDITIONS ARE VARIED NOW APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE TO THE MOISTURE GLOBULES OF WHICH A CLOUD IS FORMED
AND THERE IS NO LONGER ANY CAUSE FOR CHANGE OF POSITION IN THE AIR THE EARTH HEATS UP QUICKLY AND IT ALSO COOLS QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS GREEN GRASS AND VEGETATION WHILE THEY ARE POOR CONDUCTORS OF HEAT THEY ARE EXCELLENT RADIATORS
BY LEVELING DOWN HILLS AND MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHERN COUNTRY
THE BIG SANDY THE KANAWHA THE HOCKING AND THE GREAT BEAVER BESIDES NUMEROUS SMALLER STREAMS HAVE THEIR OWN VALLEYS THAT HAVE BEEN WORN AWAY BY THE SAME PROCESS AND TO A GREATER DEPTH THAN THEY NOW APPEAR TO BE
AND WHICH IN TURN CAUSES THE DENSER OR COLDER AIR FROM THE LAND TO FLOW TOWARD THE OCEAN AND DISPLACE THE LIGHTER AIR AND FORCE IT UPWARD HENCE WE HAVE A LAND INSTEAD OF A SEA BREEZE
BUT BY A VIOLENT COMPRESSION THERE IS A PECULIAR WIND THAT OCCURS IN SWITZERLAND OFTEN BETWEEN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND MARCH THESE WINDS LAST FROM TWO TO THREE DAYS AND ARE OF GREAT VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
WHILE THEY ARE UNNECESSARY FOR BREATHING PURPOSES IT WILL BE WELL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AS SOME OF THEM ARE THINGS TO BE AVOIDED RATHER THAN INHALED AS BEFORE MENTIONED AIR CONTAINS MOISTURE WHICH IS A VERY VARIABLE QUANTITY
DOCTOR WRIGHT ESTIMATES THAT THERE IS NOT LESS THAN ONE MILLION SQUARE MILES OF TERRITORY IN NORTH AMERICA COVERED WITH GLACIAL DEBRIS TO AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTY FEET OF COURSE THE DEPTH VARIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES FROM A FEW INCHES TO SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET
WHICH IS PRESSING ON IT WITH A FORCE OF FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AT SEA LEVEL WHEN AIR IS HEATED IT EXPANDS AND AS IT EXPANDS IT GROWS LIGHTER THE STRATUM LYING UPON THE EARTH AS SOON AS IT BECOMES HEATED MOVES UPWARD
WEIGHS FIFTEEN POUNDS THE DENSITY OF THE AIR DECREASES AS WE ASCEND EACH SUCCESSIVE LAYER AS WE ASCEND IS MORE AND MORE EXPANDED AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS A LESS AND LESS NUMBER OF AIR MOLECULES IN A GIVEN SPACE
HEAT RADIATION FROM THE EARTH GOES ON IN WINTER WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT A THICK COVERING OF SNOW IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO VEGETATION AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF FROST
OXYGEN ALSO EXISTS IN THE AIR IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES IN ANOTHER FORM CALLED OZONE ONE WAY TO PRODUCE OZONE IS BY PASSING AN ELECTRIC SPARK THROUGH AIR ANYONE WHO HAS OPERATED A HOLTZ MACHINE
TERRACES WERE FORMED RUNNING UP THE OHIO AND ITS TRIBUTARIES CORRESPONDING TO THE LEVEL THAT THE WATER MUST HAVE RISEN TO IF THE VALLEY WERE FILLED UP WITH ICE THESE FACTS TAKEN WITH THE GREATER FACT THAT THE ICE SHEET ACTUALLY DID CROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO KENTUCKY
AS THE AIR DESCENDS IT IS MORE AND MORE COMPRESSED WHICH CAUSES IT TO BECOME MORE AND MORE HEATED
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THESE USUALLY HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE FAR NORTHWEST AND FOLLOW EACH OTHER SWEEPING DOWN THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND GRADUALLY BENDING EASTERLY AND FROM THAT TO NORTHEASTERLY BY THE TIME THEY REACH THE ATLANTIC COAST
AND THE CLOUDS PRECEDE THE RAIN HENCE ALL THE ARTIFICIAL ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE RAIN IN THESE ARID REGIONS HAVE BEEN FUTILE IF A BODY OF WARM AIR WHEN SATURATED WITH INVISIBLE MOISTURE
A BAROMETER MAY READ LOW AT ONE STATION BY THE SCALE BUT MAY BE HIGH WITH REFERENCE TO SOME OTHER BAROMETER THAT READS VERY LOW WHAT IS A BAROMETER IF WE SHOULD TAKE A GLASS TUBE CLOSED AT ONE END THE AREA OF THE CROSS SECTION OF WHICH IS ONE INCH SQUARE
THUS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE BAROMETER WILL REGISTER THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN AIR PRESSURE LET US DWELL FOR A MOMENT ON THE CAUSES OF WHAT ARE COMMONLY CALLED CHANGES OF WEATHER WHEN WE WILL AGAIN REVERT TO THE USE OF THE BAROMETER
AND NOT BE DRAGGED AROUND BY THE INCREASED MOTION WE FIND THERE TO MAKE THIS STILL PLAINER
IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT DEW PERFORMS AN IMPORTANT PART IN SUPPORTING VEGETATION THE SAME OPERATION IN NATURE'S GREAT WORKSHOP THAT FORMS THE DEWS OF SUMMER CREATES THE FROSTS OF WINTER
WHERE THERE IS A CONFLICT OF THE ELEMENTS AS THERE ALWAYS IS WHEN COLD AND WARM CURRENTS MEET THE ONLY POINT WHERE THE TRADE WIND HAS FREE PLAY IS IN THE SOUTH INDIAN OCEAN AND THIS IS CALLED THE HEART OF THE TRADES
CONSUMES SOMETHING OVER FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OF OXYGEN PER DAY AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ALL THE FIRES ON THE EARTH CONSUME IN A CENTURY AS MUCH OXYGEN AS IS CONTAINED IN THE AIR OVER AN AREA OF SEVENTY MILES SQUARE
EXCAVATED IN THE EARTH OVER WHICH IS PLACED SOME SUBSTANCE LIKE STRAW THAT READILY RADIATES HEAT AND ON THE STRAW ARE PLACED POROUS BRICKS THAT ARE KEPT WET THUS FURNISHING A VERY LARGE EVAPORATING SURFACE
THE WHOLE SYSTEM MOVES IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE WINDS ARE BLOWING SPIRALLY ABOUT THE STORM CENTER IF WE SHOULD BE IN THE TRACK OF A MOVING STORM SO THAT ITS CENTER PASSED OVER US THE WINDS AT THE BEGINNING WOULD BLOW IN ONE DIRECTION
ALTHOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AT SOME DISTANCE ABOVE THE GROUND IS SOME DEGREES ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT THE REASON FOR THIS WILL BE OBVIOUS WHEN WE CONSIDER THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN SET FORTH CONCERNING THE POWER OF RADIATION TO PRODUCE COLD
NEW MOLECULES ARE FORMED AND A NEW SUBSTANCE IS THE RESULT
FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THESE LOCAL WINDS ARE FREQUENTLY VERY SEVERE ONLY LASTING HOWEVER FOR A SHORT TIME UNTIL AN EQUILIBRIUM OF TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
AND THE SALT WATER IS FOUND IN THE BED OF THE OLD RIVER GREAT BODIES OF SALT ARE FOUND AT THAT LOW LEVEL CONSTANTLY DISSOLVED BY THE WATER PERCOLATING THROUGH THE SAND AND GRAVEL OF THE GLACIAL DRIFT THIS SALT WATER IS PUMPED UP AND EVAPORATED
THAT IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE INHABITANTS OF HOT COUNTRIES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ICE AND IN OUR OWN LAND FOR STORING IT PERHAPS EVERYONE WHO HAS LIVED IN THE COUNTRY HAS NOTICED THAT ON A SUMMER'S MORNING WHEN THE GRASS IS LADEN WITH DEWDROPS
BUT IF WE SHOULD TRAVEL NORTHWARD TO WITHIN FOUR MILES SAY OF THE NORTH POLE
WITH THE DRIFT CARRIED DOWN BY THE RIVERS HAS SOMEWHAT RAISED ITS LEVEL BUT HARDLY TO THE EXTENT INDICATED BY THE OLD RIVER BEDS THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES WHERE DID ALL THE DIRT COME FROM TO FILL UP THESE GREAT RIVER BEDS
WHICH WAS TRANSPARENT BEFORE IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE COLD OUTSIDE AIR THE EFFECT BEING MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED IN COLD THAN IN WARM WEATHER WE MAY LIKEN THESE FLOATING GLOBULES OF MIST TO THE DUST OF THE EARTH WHICH FLOATS IN THE AIR
AS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE COLD THAT IS PRODUCED BY RADIATION THROUGH THE BLADES OF GRASS AND OTHER RADIATING SUBSTANCES MAY BE INDICATED BY PLACING ONE THERMOMETER ON THE GROUND AND FIXING ANOTHER AT SOME POINT IN THE AIR
AS NIGHT COMES ON THIS UPWARD MOVEMENT WILL CEASE AND THERE WILL BE A SEASON OF QUIET UNTIL THE EARTH HAS BECOME COLDER THAN THE AIR AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENON OF EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE KIND WHEN THE AIR CONTRACTS INSTEAD OF EXPANDS
INVOLVING GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY WHEN A TORNADO MOVES OFF THE LAND ON TO THE OCEAN IT MAY BECOME WHAT IS TERMED A WATERSPOUT THESE PROBABLY NEVER ORIGINATE ON THE WATER
TO A HEIGHT AT SEA LEVEL OF EIGHTY OR NINETY MILES GRADUALLY THINNING OUT INTO THE ETHER THAT FILLS ALL INTERSTELLAR SPACE WE LIVE AND MOVE ON THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT OCEAN OF AIR
SO MUCH SO THAT IF THEY WERE WIDESPREAD AND OF LONG CONTINUANCE LIKE THE NORTHERN BLIZZARD THEY WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND DESTRUCTION TO VEGETATION
AND DEW WILL FORM IF HOWEVER IT IS CLOUDY OR THE WIND IS BLOWING THERE IS RARELY ANY FORMATION OF DEW THE REASON IN THE FORMER CASE AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED IS THAT THE RADIATED HEAT IS HELD DOWN TO THE EARTH IN A MEASURE
IT WOULD REACH ONLY ABOUT FIVE MILES HIGH BUT AS IT BECOMES GRADUALLY RAREFIED AS WE ASCEND IT PROBABLY EXTENDS IN A VERY THIN STATE TO A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY MILES AT LEAST AT THAT HEIGHT
AND YOU HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE WEATHER CHANGES AS THEY OCCUR IN THE MIDDLE UNITED STATES BY REFERRING TO FIG THREE YOU WILL SEE WHY THE WIND CHANGES ITS DIRECTION WHEN A STORM CENTER PASSES OVER ANY POINT
IF THE AIR IS CHARGED TO SATURATION WITH MOISTURE AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE IT WILL REMAIN SO AND EVAPORATION STOPS SO LONG AS THE TEMPERATURE REMAINS UNCHANGED IF ITS TEMPERATURE RISES THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION CAN START UP
AND NEARLY ALL WE CAN SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE EYE OF IMAGINATION WE DO KNOW THAT SUBSTANCES SUCH AS FLUIDS OR GASES ASSUME VERY DIFFERENT QUALITIES WHEN PUT INTO DIFFERENT RATES OF MOTION
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE BLADES OF GRASS STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY THAT EVER FLASHED IN THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF A BALLROOM IF NOT YOU HAVE MISSED A PICTURE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNG ON THE WALLS OF YOUR MEMORY
THE WATER IS PULVERIZED INTO A SPRAY THAT IS DRIVEN IN EVERY DIRECTION SOMETIMES THESE VIOLENT BLASTS OCCUR IN THE ALPS BUT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT CAUSE
AS IS INDICATED BY THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BAROMETER NOW LET US CONSIDER THE BALLOON AS A GLOBULE OF MOISTURE OF A DEFINITE WEIGHT AND THIS GLOBULE ONLY ONE OF AN AGGREGATION OF GLOBULES SUFFICIENT TO FORM A CLOUD
MANY OF THEM DISEASE GERMS BY ANALYSIS OF THE AIR IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT ON THE OCEAN AND ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS THESE GERMS AVERAGE ONLY ONE TO EACH CUBIC YARD OF AIR
SUCH AS DURING THE PREVALENCE OF A STORM IN SOME OF THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA HOTTEST DURING THE DAY TIME THE NIGHTS ARE MADE ENDURABLE AND EVEN DELIGHTFUL
I SUPPOSE MEN AND ANIMALS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO ORGANIZED THAT THEY COULD BREATHE PURE OXYGEN WITHOUT BEING HURT BUT THEY WERE NOT FOR SOME REASON MADE THAT WAY AIR CONTAINS MORE OR LESS MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF VAPOR
ALONG THE RIDGES OF SOME OF THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS ARE FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE THE PRODUCTS OF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN THESE EVIDENCES SHOW THAT AT SOME PERIOD WHEN THE MOUNTAINS WERE FORMED
DRAINAGE BEFORE THE ICE AGE WE HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT DURING THE ICE AGE RIVER BEDS WERE CHANGED VALLEYS WERE FILLED UP NEW LAKES WERE MADE AND WATERFALLS CREATED GREAT AS WERE THE CHANGES MADE BY THE CARRYING POWER OF MOVING ICE
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IN A SHORT TIME THE WATER WILL BE FROZEN IN HOT COUNTRIES ICE IS MANUFACTURED ON A LARGE SCALE UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED WATER IS PUT INTO SHALLOW BASINS
THE DIURNAL CHANGES ARE EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH ON ITS AXIS EACH DAY BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF PHENOMENA WITH WHICH THE WEATHER MAN HAS TO STRUGGLE WHEN HE IS MAKING UP A FORECAST OF THE WEATHER FROM DAY TO DAY
WE CAN READILY SEE FROM WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE THAT A CLOUD THUS FORMED HAVING A DEFINITE DENSITY AND WEIGHT WOULD FLOAT HIGHER SOME DAYS THAN OTHERS ASSUMING AGAIN THAT THE DENSITY OF THE AIR REMAINS THE SAME FROM DAY TO DAY
LEAVING THE SALT FORMING ONE OF THE IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES OF THAT REGION ALL OF THE RIVERS FROM THE OHIO EASTWARD TELL THE SAME STORY WHICH IS THAT AT SOME REMOTE PERIOD THE LAND WAS MUCH HIGHER ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THAN IT IS TO DAY
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT A GREAT PORTION OF LOUISIANA AND WESTERN MISSISSIPPI
EVAPORATION IS CARRIED ON MUCH MORE RAPIDLY WHEN THE WIND BLOWS THAN AT OTHER TIMES FOR THE REASON THAT THE MOISTURE IS CARRIED OFF LATERALLY AS FAST AS IT IS FORMED ALL RESISTANCE TO ITS ESCAPE INTO THE UPPER AIR BEING REMOVED
SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT AS WE DO THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS IF HOWEVER THE BODY OF AIR THAT IS SATURATED WITH THIS INVISIBLE MOISTURE BECOMES SUDDENLY CHILLED THE MOISTURE CONDENSES INTO CLOUD OR MIST
THE PROBLEM OF BUILDING A WORLD AND THEN TEARING IT TO PIECES IS A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THERE IS A CONSTANT BATTLE GOING ON BETWEEN THE POWERS THAT BUILD UP AND THOSE THAT TEAR DOWN AND THIS IS AS TRUE OF CHARACTER BUILDING AS IT IS OF WORLD BUILDING
THE STEEPER THE GRADE THE MORE RAPIDLY THE FLUID WILL FLOW LET US NOW HAVE RECOURSE FOR A MOMENT TO FIGS ONE TWO AND THREE IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECT MAY BE MORE FULLY UNDERSTOOD IN LOOKING AT THESE DIAGRAMS WE SHOULD IMAGINE OURSELVES LOOKING SOUTH
CALLED BACTERIA AT ONE TIME THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOW FORMS OF ANIMAL LIFE BUT IT IS NOW DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE THE LOWEST FORMS OF VEGETABLE GERMS BACTERIA IS THE GENERAL OR GENERIC NAME FOR A LARGE CLASS OF GERMS
AND SO TO PRODUCE COLD IN THE SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH THE EVAPORATION TAKES PLACE IF WE PUT WATER INTO A VIAL AND DROP REGULARLY UPON IT SOME FLUID THAT EVAPORATES READILY IT WILL EXTRACT THE HEAT FROM THE VIAL AND THE WATER IN IT
WHEN AFTER A SEASON OF LOCAL STORMS THE CONDITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THESE WINDS ARE CALLED MONSOONS
HAS NOTICED A PECULIAR SMELL ATTENDING THE DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGES WHICH IS THE ODOR OF OZONE IT IS WHAT CHEMISTS CALL AN ALLOTROPIC FORM OF OXYGEN JUST AS THE DIAMOND GRAPHITE AND CHARCOAL ARE ALL DIFFERENT FORMS OF CARBON
THIS IS EVIDENCED IN VERY MANY WAYS BY SOUNDING THE DEPTHS OF OLD RIVER BEDS NOW FILLED WITH GLACIAL DEBRIS THE OLD BEDS SHOW UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCES OF HAVING BEEN WORN DOWN TO THEIR PRESENT LEVEL BY THE ACTION OF RUNNING WATER
THAT THE ABILITY OF ANY SUBSTANCE TO ABSORB HEAT DEPENDS UPON THE NUMBER OF ATOMS IT CONTAINS
THE THING IS PREPOSTEROUS AND YET THIS VERY THING BEGINS TO RECEIVE CREDENCE IN THE MINDS OF MANY OF MORE AS NEW FACTS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE MAGISTERIAL ENQUIRY CARRIED ON INSIDE THE HOUSE
WHO IS HABITUALLY A DWELLER IN CITIES INSTEAD THE FORMER IS A FRANK MANLY FELLOW DEVOTED TO FIELD SPORTS AND RURAL PASTIMES A LITTLE BRUSQUE IN MANNER BUT FOR ALL WELL BRED AND WHAT IS EVEN BETTER WELL BEHAVED
AT LENGTH TO CULMINATE IN CALLING HIM A MURDERER INSTEAD OF VOLUNTARILY PRESENTING HIMSELF AT LLANGORREN ALONE ARMS AND LIMBS FREE THEY EXPECTED TO SEE HIM
BUT DON'T NOW MY GOOD FELLOW I FEAR YOU ARE DECEIVING YOURSELF I'M SORRY HAVING TO THINK SO WHY THE BODY HAS BEEN TAKEN UP AGAIN IS OF ITSELF A SUFFICIENT PUZZLE BUT ALIVE THAT SEEMS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
INTRODUCED BY THE YOUNG LADIES AS THE GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN THE PLEASURE BOAT WAS CAUGHT IN A DANGEROUS WHIRL OUT OF WHICH OLD JOSEPH WAS UNABLE TO EXTRICATE IT CAME TO THEIR RESCUE POSSIBLY TO THE SAVING OF THEIR LIVES THUS THE VERSION OF THE ADVENTURE
MISS LINTON NEED HAVE NO FEAR THAT THE IMPURE STREAM WILL CEASE TO FLOW ANY MORE THAN THE LIMPID WATERS OF THE WYE NOR HAS SHE BUT READS ON DEVOURING VOLUME AFTER VOLUME IN TRIUNES AS THEY ISSUE FROM THE PRESS AND ARE SENT HER FROM THE CIRCULATING LIBRARY
THOUGH NOT ALWAYS THE CHASTEST OF THE PRURIENT TRASH THERE IS A PLENTEOUS SUPPLY FURNISHED BY SCRIBBLERS OF BOTH SEXES WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AND DOUBTLESS DO
HE HAS SPENT PART OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT AT THE WELSH HARP THE TAVERN SPOKEN OF BY WINGATE AND HIS NERVES ARE UNSTRUNG YET NOT RECOVERED FROM THE REVELRY INSTEAD OF ASKING HER WHAT SHE MEANS BY SOME OTHER MISCHANCE
CALLED HER SON OUT SPOKE A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHEN THEY STARTED AWAY IN THE SKIFF SHE SAW THEY WENT DOWN STREAM THAT IS ALL SHE WAS SOME LITTLE SURPRISED THOUGH NOT AT THE DIRECTION TAKEN
BAD OR GOOD I DON'T THINK YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN ATTRIBUTING IT TO CHANCE WHEN A GENTLEMAN DELIBERATELY STATIONS HIMSELF BEHIND A SHADY BUSH LIKE THAT LAURUSTINUS FOR INSTANCE AND THERE STANDS LISTENING INTENTIONALLY
THE HUE AND CRY IS AT ITS LOUDEST NO LONGER CONFINED TO THE FAMILY AND DOMESTICS NO MORE THE RELATIVES AND INTIMATE FRIENDS PEOPLE OF ALL CLASSES AND KINDS TAKE PART IN IT THE PLEASURE GROUNDS OF LLANGORREN
OH NO I NOTICED NOTHIN O ALL THAT NOT I TWARN'T MEANT FOR ME NOT FOR JOE HA HA WITH A SUPPRESSED GIGGLE AT THE POPULAR CATCH COMING IN SO APROPOS HE ONCE MORE FIXES HIS EYES ON THE FACE OF THE IMPATIENT WATCHER
WHICH TO SAY TRUTH HE NEVER HAS OH NO ANSWERS THE PRIEST WITH AN ASSUMED INDIFFERENCE NO HARM WHATEVER AND NO BUSINESS OF OURS
NO SOUNDS SUCH AS HE WOULD WISH AND MIGHT EXPECT TO HEAR NO DIPPING OF OARS NOR WHAT WOULD BE STILL MORE AGREEABLE TO HIS EAR THE SOFT VOICES OF WOMEN INSTEAD ONLY THE NOTE OF A CUCKOO IN MONOTONOUS REPETITION
WITH A FEAR SOME SINISTER MISCHANCE HAS OVERTAKEN MISS WYNN MANY A YOUNG FARMER IS THERE WHO HAS RIDDEN BESIDE HER IN THE HUNTING FIELD OFTEN BEHIND HER NO WAYS NETTLED BY HER GIVING HIM THE LEAD INSTEAD ADMIRING HER COURAGE AND STYLE OF TAKING FENCES OVER WHICH
BUT WHAT DID APPEAR ODD AN GIED ME A START TOO WOR MY SEEIN A BOAT BY THE SLOOP'S SIDE WI A MAN IN IT
HER COUSIN THE LADY'S MAID AND ONE OR TWO OTHER DOMESTICS ARE SUBMITTED TO EXAMINATION ALL TESTIFY TO THEIR BELIEF THAT THE BODY BEFORE THEM IS THAT OF GWENDOLINE WYNN MISS LINTON
SHE INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS THEM TO BE IN THE HANDS OF HER SON FOR JACK ROWS WITH A STROKE NO WATERMAN ON THE WYE HAS BUT HE
HAWKS I SUPPOSE YOU'D SAY BEING A GAME PRESERVER NEVER MIND ABOUT THE SIMILE LET US IN TO LUNCHEON IF NOT TOO LATE SHE STEPS HURRIEDLY OFF TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE COMPANION FOLLOWING SHENSTONE BEHIND BOTH HOWEVER HUNGRY THEY
IS IT LIKELY THEY WILL MISS LINTON I SHOULD SAY NOT
THE LOST ONE HAS AT LENGTH BEEN FOUND FOUND WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDED AND THE DRAG COULD DO ITS WORK FOUND DROWNED NOT FAR AWAY NOR YET IN THE MAIN RIVER BUT THAT NARROW CHANNEL
NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTING BUT PERPLEXING NAY I AM SURE CONTINUES MISS LINTON WITH PROVOKING COOLNESS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO GO RIDING WITH YOU DELIGHTED BUT WHY CAN'T THEY ASKED SHENSTONE IMPATIENTLY INTERRUPTING
AND NOW SHE ONLY WAITS FOR IT TO BE PULLED UP AND INTO THE WASH ITS DOCKING PLACE WHEN JACK WILL TELL HER WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN AND WHAT FOR PERHAPS TOO THE CAPTAIN WILL COME INSIDE THE COTTAGE
THAN LEAD SUCH A TRISTE LIFE AS WE'RE NOW DOING LIVING IN THIS WRETCHED KENNEL OF A HOUSE THAT THREATENS TO TUMBLE ON OUR HEADS HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN THAT OVER YONDER HE NODS TOWARDS LLANGORREN COURT YOU ARE MERRY MONSIEUR
THE CONSTRUCTION PUT UPON LEWIN MURDOCK'S MOTIVES IS CONFINED TO THE FEW FOR ONLY A FEW KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS INTERESTED IN THE UPSHOT OF THAT SEARCH AGAIN IT IS SET ON FOOT BUT NOT AS ON THE DAY PRECEDING
SINCE TO LEWIN MURDOCK AND HIS WIFE THE SOCIETY OF HEREFORDSHIRE IS TABOOED BUT THEY CAN GUESS FROM THE SYMBOLS THAT IT IS TO BE A GARDEN PARTY OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT THERE OFTEN GIVEN WHILE THEY ARE STILL GAZING ITS SPECIAL KIND IS DECLARED
AND HINT AT A LIMITED SACRIFICE ONLY HER HAND AND IT MORE THAN TENDERLY PRESSED BY SCORES AY HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BEFORE BEING BESTOWED UPON HIM NO FALSE PRETENCE HOWEVER ON HER PART HE KNEW ALL THAT OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT
SHE PROMISED ME TO GO RIDING TO DAY VERY ODD INDEED GWEN ISN'T THE SAME SHE WAS ACTING STRANGE ALTOGETHER FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS WONDER WHAT IT MEANS BY JOVE I CAN'T COMPREHEND IT
AND IS NOW ON THE WAY FOR IT PRETTY SURE OF BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS OBJECT TRUE TO HER FASHIONABLE INSTINCTS AND TOILETTE NECESSITIES MISS LINTON KEEPS A FRENCH MAID
AS WHICH SHOULD HAVE PRECEDENCE TO THIS NICE IF NOT VERY DELICATE APPRECIATION THE REVEREND WILLIAM IS NOW INDEBTED MORE THAN HE IS AWARE IT HAS SAVED HIM FROM AN OUTBURST OF MISS LINTON'S RATHER TART TEMPER WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
EARLIER THAN USUAL SO I MUST GET BACK IMMEDIATELY
THE STURDY DAMES AND ROBUST DAMSELS NOW RAMBLING OVER ITS GROUNDS AND GRAVELLED WALKS ARE THE DWELLERS IN ROADSIDE COTTAGES WHO AT THE WORDS MURDERED OR MISSING DROP BROOMS UPON HALF SWEPT FLOORS LEAVE BABIES UNCARED FOR IN THEIR CRADLES AND ARE OFF TO THE INDICATED SPOT
WHO HEARKENING FURTHER HEARS OTHER SPEECHES WHICH WHILE PERPLEXING HIM DO NOUGHT TO ALLAY THE WILD TEMPEST NOW SURGING THROUGH HIS SOUL UNSEEN HIMSELF FOR HE HAS STEPPED BEHIND THE TREE LATELY SCREENING JOSEPH HE SEES GWEN WYNN
HASTENING OUT HE SEES A GRAND CARRIAGE DRAWN UP AT THE GATE DOUBLE HORSED WITH COACHMAN AND FOOTMAN ON THE BOX INSIDE YOUNG MISTER POWELL HIS PRETTY SISTER AND TWO OTHERS A LADY AND GENTLEMAN ALSO YOUNG SOON THEY ARE ALL SEATED IN THE BOAT
AND HAS BEEN EVER SINCE THAT HOUR WHEN A FARM LABOURER
THEN SEEING WHAT LED HIM TO SUSPECT THAT NOT ONLY HAD THE PLANT BEEN DESTROYED BUT ALL THE TURF ON THE GRAVE DISTURBED HE SPEAKS OF HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THIS WITH HIS PERPLEXITY
THE LOOK WITH WHICH HE STOOD REGARDING THE GIRL'S FACE AS SHE LAY IN HER COFFIN HIS ABRUPT EXIT OUT OF THE ROOM AS AFTERWARDS HIS HURRIED DEPARTURE FROM THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE BEFORE IT WAS FINALLY CLOSED UP
HE BUT REMARKS WITH AN AIR OF CARELESS INDIFFERENCE TRUE OLYMPE UNLESS SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WERE TO HAPPEN THERE SEEMS NO HELP FOR US BUT TO RESIGN OURSELVES TO PATIENCE AND LIVE ON EXPECTATIONS STARVE ON THEM YOU MEAN THIS IN A TONE AND WITH A SHRUG
THERE ARE OTHERS PRESENT WHO SEEK HER SMILES SOME ASPIRING TO HER HAND BUT NONE HE FEARS SO MUCH AS THE ONE STILL ABSENT JUST AS HE IS BECOMING CALM AND CONFIDENT HE IS SALUTED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE GENUS SWELL WHO APPROACHING
AS JOSEPH GLIDES PAST AND ON DOWN THE STAIR THEN REPEATING WHO THE DEUCE IS HE THE INTERROGATION AS BEFORE REFERRING TO HIM WHO ROWS THE PLEASURE BOAT BY THIS IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT BOW IN TO THE DOCK ITS STERN TOUCHING THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR
AND THERE PUT ABOARD THE FRENCH SCHOONER LA CHOUETTE CARRIED ACROSS TO BOULOGNE TO BE SHUT UP IN A CONVENT FOR LIFE ALL THESE DELICATE MATTERS MANAGED BY FATHER ROGIER BACKED BY
MISS LEES AND I HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVENTURE AND IF YOU'LL PROMISE IT SHAN'T GO FURTHER WE'LL MAKE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH IT ADDRESSED IN THIS STYLE HE READILY GIVES THE PROMISE GLADLY TOO THE CONFIDENCE SO OFFERED SEEMS FAVOURABLE TO HIMSELF
BUT ALTOGETHER LIKE ONE BORN UPON THE BANKS OF THE SEINE AND BROUGHT UP TO TREAD THE BOULEVARDS OF PARIS LIKE THE LATTER FROM THE CROWN OF HER HEAD TO THE SOLES OF HER HIGH HEELED BOOTS ON WHOSE TOES SHE STANDS POISED AND BALANCING IN FRONT OF THAT ANCIENT ENGLISH MANOR HOUSE
BUT TO THESE ON REFLECTION HIS BEHAVIOUR IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE THEY CONSTRUE IT DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHERS THE OUTSIDE SPECTATORS MORE THAN ONE OF THEM OBSERVING THE ANXIOUS EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE
ESPECIALLY UPON MATTERS THAT CONCERN HIMSELF AND ABOVE ALL WHEN HE HAS A TROUBLE ON HIS MIND IN SHORT ONE WHO KEEPS HIS SORROWS LOCKED UP IN HIS BREAST AS THOUGH PREFERRING TO SUFFER IN SILENCE
INSTEAD NEGLIGENTLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE WITH THOUGHTS ABSTRACTED HER EYES EVERY NOW AND THEN STRAYING OVER THE GROUND SCANNING THE VARIOUS GROUPS AS IF IN SEARCH OF A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THE GATHERING IS LARGE NEARLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE PRESENT
BUT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT UNLESS THE PARTY SO PASSING SHOULD CHOOSE TO MAKE STOP IN THE PLACE EXPOSED IT IS A THOROUGHFARE NOT MUCH FREQUENTED THOUGH FREE TO FATHER ROGIER AS ANY ONE ELSE AND NOW HASTENING ALONG IT
THE CHANGE HE NOTES IN GEORGE SHENSTONE'S MANNER IS NOT CAUSED BY THE RETURNING PLEASURE CRAFT SIMPLY A REFLECTION WHICH CROSSING HIS MIND FOR THE MOMENT TRANQUILLISES HIM WHAT A STUPID I AM HE MUTTERS SELF ACCUSINGLY
SHE KNOWS THE CAPTAIN CANNOT BE BOUND THITHER AND THEREFORE WONDERS WHITHER SURELY NOT A PLEASURE EXCURSION AT SUCH AN UNREASONABLE HOUR NIGHT JUST DRAWING DOWN
THE SUN HAVING LONG SINCE SET AND STILL WONDERING WHY THEY WENT DOWN THE RIVER
FROM THE COTTAGE BUT LITTLE CAN BE SEEN OF THE STREAM BY REASON OF ITS TORTUOUS COURSE ONLY A SHORT REACH ON EITHER SIDE ABOVE AND BELOW
AN SO KEP ASLEEP TO BE WAKED UP WHEN THEY WANTED HER I'VE HEERD SAY THEY CAN DO SUCH THINGS BUT THEN SHE WAS DROWNED ALSO FELL FROM A FOOT PLANK YOU TOLD ME
BUT HER WAKING VISION OF A LIGHT BORNE UP THE RIVER BOTTOM WAS A PHENOMENON YET MORE NATURAL SINCE IN TRUTH WAS IT A REAL LIGHT THAT OF A LAMP CARRIED IN THE HANDS OF A MAN WITH A CORACLE ON HIS BACK
AND THINK THIS STRANGE TOO SINCE THE GWENDOLINE CARRIES ONLY ONE BUT HE IS NOT SO SKILLED INSTEAD RATHER AVERSE TO AQUATICS HIS CHOSEN HOME THE HUNTING FIELD HIS FAVOURITE SEAT IN A SADDLE NOT ON A BOAT'S THWART
FOR LUTESTRING IS NOT QUITE OUT OF HER THOUGHTS THERE'S NO KNOWING HOWEVER MISS WYNN IS ACCUSTOMED TO COME AND GO WITHOUT MUCH CONSULTING ME THIS WITH SOME ACERBITY
GEORGE SHENSTONE STRONG MAN THOUGH HE BE VISIBLY TREMBLES WERE GWEN WYNN AT THAT MOMENT TO FACE ABOUT AND AIM ONE OF HER ARROWS AT HIS BREAST IT WOULD NOT BRING MORE PALLOR UPON HIS CHEEKS NOR PAIN TO HIS HEART
BEIN AWARE O THAT THEIR ONLY CHANCE WOR TO GET HER OUT O MY WAY BY SOME TRICK
ANOTHER SHROUD REPOSING IN THE TOMB WHERE ALL BELIEVED GWEN WYNN TO HAVE BEEN LAID THIS LAST FACT IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THE FAMILY VAULT OF THE WYNNS IS RE OPENED AND MISSUS MORGAN
YOU'VE BEEN PROMPT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU QUITE SO SOON MADAME LA CHATELAINE OBLIVIOUS I APPREHEND IN THE MIDST OF HER AFTERNOON NAP
NOT ONLY INSPIRES CONFIDENCE BUT EXCITES HER TO THE DISPLAY OF SKILL
GWEN WYNN NOW SEEING THAT FORM PROSTRATE AND PULSELESS
AND ALMOST UPSETTING THE TABLE ALIVE HE MECHANICALLY REPEATS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WINGATE AND WHO MY POOR GIRL CAPTAIN YOU KNOW HIS GIRL NOT MINE MARY MORGAN NOT GWENDOLINE WYNN
BUT NO THERE IS ANOTHER THROE YET ONE HORRIBLE AS ANY THAT HAS PRECEDED LOOKING UP HE SEES THE SUPERINTENDENT'S UNIFORM AND SILVER BUTTONS
SUDDENLY SHE INTERRUPTS HERSELF AND STANDS SILENT TOO THIS ON OBSERVING THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS AND THAT THEY HAVE STRUCK TERRIBLY HOME WITH BOWED HEAD THE BARONET'S SON IS STOOPING TOWARDS HER THE CLOUD ON HIS BROW TELLING OF SADNESS NOT ANGER
NO DOUBT YOU THINK IT WITTY DEAR OR NOT BETTER A GARRET THERE
THAT IT IS HIS STROKE SHE HAS SOON OTHER EVIDENCE THAN HER EARS IN A FEW SECONDS AFTER HEARING THE OARS SHE SEES THEM THEIR WET BLADES GLISTENING IN THE MOONLIGHT THE BOAT BETWEEN
BUT GWEN'S MAID INFORMS ME THEY LEFT THE HOUSE THEN AND I PRESUME THEY WENT DIRECT TO THE RIVER DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE OUT LONG EARNESTLY INTERROGATES SHENSTONE I SHOULD HOPE NOT RETURNS THE ANCIENT TOAST OF CHELTENHAM WITH AGGRAVATING INDIFFERENCE
MISS LINTON HERSELF RECEIVES A SHOCK CAUSED BY A RAT TAT AT THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR LIGHT SUCH AS WELL TRAINED SERVANTS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GIVE BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM OCCUPIED BY MASTER OR MISTRESS TO HER COMMAND COME IN
AND PITIES HIM NEVER MORE THAN AT THIS SAME MOMENT DESPITE THAT DISTANT HALF DISDAINFUL ADIEU VOUCHSAFED TO HER AT PARTING BY HIM INTENDED TO CONCEAL HIS THOUGHTS AS HIS SUFFERINGS WHILE BUT THE BETTER REVEALING THEM
THE ONE MOST WANTED IS VIVIAN RYECROFT HIMSELF AND NEXT TO HIM THE WATERMAN WINGATE NEITHER HAS YET MADE APPEARANCE AT LLANGORREN NOR HAS EITHER BEEN HEARD OF THE POLICEMAN SENT AFTER THE LAST
YOU THINK TOO LOUD MONSIEUR
CONTROLLING IT THE OTHER ASKS WITH DIMINISHED INTEREST STILL EARNESTLY WHAT LEADS YOU TO THINK THAT WAY WINGATE HAVE YOU A REASON YES HAVE I MORE'N ONE
BOTH KNOWING THE GIVER AS THE NATURE OF THE GIFT HOW COMES IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE SUMMER HOUSE DROPPED OF COURSE BUT UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES QUESTIONS PERPLEXING WHILE THE THING ITSELF SERIOUSLY HEIGHTENS THE ALARM
AND WITH HIS FINGERS CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT AS IF TO UNDO A NOOSE HE GASPS OUT IN HUSKY VOICE GONE BY GOD AT THIS HE DROPS OVER DEAD HIS LAST WORD AN OATH
AND BIDDING A POLITE AND FORMAL ADIEU TO MISS LINTON WITH ONE EQUALLY CEREMONIOUS BUT MORE DISTANT TO MISS WYNN HE SLIPS ROUND TO THE STABLES ORDERS HIS HORSE LEAPS INTO THE SADDLE AND RIDES OFF
ANY MORE THAN WOULD FIVE BARRED GATE OR BULLFINCH HINDER HIM FROM KEEPING UP WITH HOUNDS AS TIME PASSES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ARRIVALS AND THE TARDY GUEST HAS NOT YET PUT IN APPEARANCE SHENSTONE BEGINS TO THINK HE WILL THIS DAY HAVE MISS WYNN TO HIMSELF
AND GROWN DARKER IN HUE WHILE THE RICH ROSE RED IS GONE FROM HER CHEEKS ALREADY SWOLLEN AND DISCOLOURED SO SOON HAD THE RUTHLESS WATER COMMENCED ITS RAVAGES NO ONE WOULD KNOW
HE ARRIVES AT THAT SPOT WHERE THE BREAK IN THE TIMBER BRINGS THE HOUSE IN VIEW HERE HE MAKES A HALT
BUT LESS IN VIEW OF WHAT HAS SINCE COME TO PASS AS SHE SUPPOSES
SHENSTONE KNOWS THE HUSSAR OFFICER HAS BEEN INVITED AND HOWEVER HOPING OR WISHING IT HAS BUT LITTLE FAITH HE WILL FAIL WERE IT HIMSELF NO ORDINARY OBSTACLE COULD PREVENT HIS BEING PRESENT AT THAT ARCHERY MEETING
THE LAMPS AND TRANSPARENCIES STILL UNEXTINGUISHED ALL NATURAL ENOUGH AND QUESTIONED AS TO WHY SHE SAID NOTHING OF IT ON THE DAY BEFORE HER ANSWER IS EQUALLY EVASIVE PARTLY THAT SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE THE THING WORTH SPEAKING OF
TANTALISED ALMOST TO TORTURE SHE FACES TOWARDS HER HUSBAND SAYING AND YOU'VE TOLD ME BETWEEN ALL THAT AND US THERE'S BUT ONE LIFE TWO INTERRUPTS A VOICE NOT HIS
AH INDEED RETURNS THE SPINSTER HOLDING OUT HER FINGERS TO BE TOUCHED BUT UNDER THE PLEA OF BEING A LITTLE INVALIDED EXCUSING HERSELF FROM RISING YES NO DOUBT THEY WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH
THE ONLY THINGS UPON HER PERSON UNCHANGED BEING THE RINGS ON HER FINGERS THE WRIST BRACELETS THE LOCKET STILL PENDANT TO HER NECK ALL GEMMED AND GLEAMING AS EVER
WHILE STILL UNDETERMINED A CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURS TO HINDER HIM FROM LONGER WITHHOLDING IT WHETHER HE WOULD OR NOT
STILL OTHERS ARE THERE IN THE EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL DUTY SEVERAL MAGISTRATES HAVE ARRIVED AT LLANGORREN AMONG THEM SIR GEORGE SHENSTONE CHAIRMAN OF THE DISTRICT BENCH THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO WITH SEVERAL OF HIS BLUE COATED SUBORDINATES
NOR INDEED HAS HE OPPORTUNITY AS JUST THEN MISS WYNN SIGHTING THE TOPEE TOO SUDDENLY TURNING SAYS TO HIM GEORGE BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE CHARGE OF THESE THINGS SHE HOLDS HER BOW WITH AN ARROW SHE HAD BEEN AFFIXING TO THE STRING
NO ONE HOWEVER RICH OR REGARDLESS WOULD FLING SUCH PRECIOUS STONES AWAY ABOVE ALL GEMS SO BESTOWED AND AS MISS LEES HAS REASON TO KNOW PRIZED AND FONDLY TREASURED
IT WAS TO HIT THIS INTERLUDE OF LEISURE FATHER ROGIER HAS BEEN HURRYING
THE BIRD BALANCING ITSELF ON A BRANCH NEAR BY AND FARTHER OFF THE HICCOL LAUGHING AS IF IN MOCKERY AND AT HIM MOCKING HIS IMPATIENCE AY SOMETHING MORE ALMOST HIS MISERY THAT IT IS SO HIS SOLILOQUY TELLS
AND FEARING TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF HE TOO FRAMES EXCUSE AND LEAVES LLANGORREN LONG BEFORE THE SPORTS COME TO A CLOSE NOT RUDELY OR WITH ANY SHOW OF SPLEEN HE IS A GENTLEMAN EVEN IN HIS ANGER
IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE AND THUS SNUBBED HE SAUNTERS AWAY BEFORE SHE IS UP TO THE SPOT RYECROFT LEFT WITH MISS LINTON REMAINS IN CONVERSATION WITH HER IT IS NOT HIS FIRST INTERVIEW
FOR YEARS THIS MAN HAS DRAWN HIS WEEKLY PAY THOUGH NEVER GOING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT THIS IS INDEED PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY BESIDES CARING FOR THE LIVING IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THIS WISE EMPLOYER OF LABOR
AND HIS TRUNKS WAITED AT THE DOOR AS HE WAS LEAVING THE HOUSE HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION SAID TO HIM WE MUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW FROM A MISTAKE IN OUR PASSPORTS A FEW HOURS LATER MISTER THOMAS HOPE AN ENGLISH BANKER
THAT HE HAS DONE WHAT HE COULD FOR THE EMANCIPATION AND ELEVATION OF HIS KIND IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE HE AGAIN VISITED EUROPE AND FOUR YEARS LATER CALIFORNIA WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS OF HONOR AND RESPECT
THE TWO SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY AND CLAPPED EACH OTHER ON THE SHOULDER AS THEY PARTED WHEN THORWALDSEN WAS SIXTY EIGHT YEARS OLD HE LEFT ROME TO END HIS DAYS AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE THE ENTHUSIASM ON HIS ARRIVAL WAS UNBOUNDED
HE SOON STOOD AT THE HEAD OF HIS LITTLE CLASS IN SPELLING AND READING AND TOOK IT SO MUCH TO HEART WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO LOSE HIS PLACE THAT HE WOULD CRY BITTERLY
WHO DECIDED TO TRY HIM ON A POLYGLOT TESTAMENT WITH MARGINAL REFERENCES SUCH CLOSE WORK THAT MOST OF THE MEN REFUSED TO DO IT MISTER WEST CAME AN HOUR OR TWO LATER AND SAID IN ANGER DID YOU HIRE THAT FOOL
THE ACADEMY OF COPENHAGEN NOW SENT HIM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR PRIDE IN HIM HOW MUCH MORE HE NEEDED IT WHEN HE WAS NEAR STARVING ALL THOSE NINE YEARS IN ROME

DON JUAN NOW WE LOOK UPON THE SMALLEST BOOK EVER PRINTED DANTE'S DIVINA COMMEDIA BOUND IN TURKEY GILT LESS THAN TWO AND ONE FOURTH INCHES LONG BY ONE AND ONE HALF INCHES WIDE THE COLLECTION OF MISTER AND MISSUS S C HALL
SOMETIMES BY SELLING NUTS OR BUNDLES OF THE ROOTS OF PITCH PINE FOR KINDLING WHICH HE CARRIED ON HIS BACK TO THE STORE THIS MONEY HE SPENT IN BOOKS BUYING MISSUS HEMANS'S POETRY AND SHAKSPEARE NO WONDER THAT THE MINISTER OF THE TOWN SAID
AND TRIED IN VAIN TO EARN A LITTLE MONEY HE SENT SOME SMALL WORKS OF HIS OWN TO COPENHAGEN BUT NOBODY BOUGHT THEM HE MADE JASON WITH THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WHEN NO ONE ORDERED IT
INTEGRITY AND TRUE FAITH IN HIMSELF
HE MUST LEAVE ROME AND GO BACK TO THE WOOD CARVING IN COPENHAGEN FOR NO ONE WANTED BEAUTIFUL THINGS UNLESS THE MAKER WAS FAMOUS HE DEFERRED GOING FROM WEEK TO WEEK TILL AT LAST HIS HUMBLE FURNITURE HAD BEEN SOLD
THAT I DON'T CARE IN THE LEAST WHAT THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT THESE THINGS SOMETIMES HE REFUSED EVEN TO DINE WITH THE KING FINDING AT LAST THAT SOCIETY WOULD GIVE HIM NO REST

THE FATHER GREELEY OUGHT TO HAVE FORESEEN THAT SUCH ENERGY AND WILL WOULD PRODUCE RESULTS BUT BECAUSE HORACE IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION TRIED TO YOKE THE OFF OX ON THE NEAR SIDE HE SAID AH
THE CHILD WALKED THE LONG NINE MILES BACK AGAIN BUT HE MUST DO SOMETHING AND A LITTLE LATER WITH SEVENTY FIVE CENTS IN HIS POCKET AND SOME FOOD TIED IN A BUNDLE WHICH HE HUNG ON THE END OF A STICK SLUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER
THE GREAT MAN WAS LAID TO REST THE TWO DAUGHTERS STEPPING INTO THE VAULT AND LAYING FLOWERS TENDERLY UPON THE COFFIN THE FOLLOWING SABBATH CLERGYMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY PREACHED ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL LIFE
SEVEN HOURS BY BOAT FROM COPENHAGEN ONCE MORE HE VISITED ROME FOR A YEAR RECEIVING ROYAL ATTENTIONS ALL THROUGH GERMANY TWO YEARS AFTER AS HE WAS SITTING IN THE THEATRE HE ROSE TO LET A LADY PASS
THE ENTERPRISE HAD TO BE ABANDONED THIS WAS A SEVERE TRIAL TO THE HARD WORKING PRINTER WHO HAD KNOWN NOTHING BUT STRUGGLES ALL HIS LIFE YEARS AFTER THIS HE WROTE THROUGH MOST OF THIS TIME I WAS VERY POOR
HAVE YOU DROPPED SOMETHING THE GREAT MAN MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS DEAD THE FUNERAL WAS A GRAND EXPRESSION OF LOVE AND HONOR HIS BODY LAY IN STATE IN THE ROYAL PALACE
A GODDESS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR SCATTERING FLOWERS WITH BOTH HANDS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN WHEN HE WAS FORTY SIX HE FINISHED HIS VENUS AFTER HAVING MADE THIRTY MODELS OF THE FIGURE
NOT HAVING HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IN FIFTEEN YEARS WHEN HIS DEATH BECAME KNOWN THE WHOLE NATION MOURNED FOR HIM NEWSPAPERS FROM MAINE TO LOUISIANA GAVE TOUCHING TRIBUTES TO HIS GREATNESS HIS PURITY
AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT BE IRRITATED AND THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO WORK HE BECAME A GREAT FAVORITE WHEN AT HIS TYPE HE WOULD OFTEN COMPOSE PARAGRAPHS FOR THE PAPER
AND THE KING AND PRINCE ROYAL RECEIVED IT IN PERSON AT THE FRUE KIRKE THEN IT WAS BORNE TO THE LARGE MUSEUM WHICH COPENHAGEN HAD BUILT TO RECEIVE HIS WORK AND BURIED IN THE CENTRE OF THE INNER COURT
AFTER HER DEATH HE COULD NOT SLEEP AT ALL AND BRAIN FEVER SOON SET IN FRIDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH THE END CAME AT NOON HE SAID DISTINCTLY
THAT THREE HUNDRED PAPERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY GAVE IT COMPLIMENTARY NOTICES IT GREW TO A SUBSCRIPTION LIST OF NINE THOUSAND PERSONS BUT MUCH OF THE BUSINESS WAS DONE ON TRUST TIMES WERE HARD AND AFTER SEVEN YEARS
WHEN THEY HAD GAINED THE RIGHT TO GET ABOVE HIM DECLINED THE HONOR BECAUSE IT HURT HORACE'S FEELINGS SO BEFORE HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE HAD READ THE BIBLE THROUGH AND PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THEIR HOME CONTAINED ONLY ABOUT TWENTY BOOKS
OF THE STANDARD AUTHORS BUT OTHER THINGS ARE OF DEEPER INTEREST
BUT THE BOY WHO COULD WALK NEARLY SIX HUNDRED MILES TO SEE HIS PARENTS AND BE LAUGHED AT FOR POOR CLOTHES WHILE HE SAVED HIS MONEY FOR THEIR USE WAS NOT TO BE OVERCOME AT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE BY THE FAILURE OF ONE OR OF A DOZEN PAPERS
JUST AS THE DOORS OF THE ROOM WERE BEING CLOSED FOR THE NIGHT A FARMER MADE HIS WAY SAYING I'VE COME A HUNDRED MILES TO BE AT THE FUNERAL OF HORACE GREELEY CAN'T YOU POSSIBLY LET ME IN TO HAVE ONE LAST LOOK
IF YOU HAVE BUT FIFTY CENTS AND CAN GET NO MORE FOR A WEEK BUY A PECK OF CORN PARCH IT AND LIVE ON IT RATHER THAN OWE ANY MAN A DOLLAR MEANTIME THE YOUNG EDITOR HAD MARRIED MISS MARY Y CHENEY
THE DISCOURAGED ARTIST BROKE IT IN PIECES THE NEXT YEAR HE MODELLED ANOTHER JASON A LADY FURNISHING THE MEANS AND WHILE EVERYBODY PRAISED IT AND CANOVA SAID
FOLLOWED BY A CONSTANT ROUND OF PARTIES SO BESET WAS HE WITH INVITATIONS TO DINNER THAT TO SAVE A LITTLE TIME FOR HIMSELF HE TOLD HIS SERVANT WILKINS THAT HE WOULD DINE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE
YOU GRIEVE FOR ROME IS FALLEN I MOURN FOR PICKIE IS DEAD HIS HOPES WERE CENTERED IN THIS CHILD AND HIS GREAT HEART NEVER REGAINED ITS FULL CHEERFULNESS
CORNELL UNIVERSITY OF WHOSE BOARD HE WAS A MEMBER DID HIM HONOR SAINT LOUIS ALBANY INDIANAPOLIS NASHVILLE AND OTHER CITIES HELD MEMORIAL MEETINGS JOHN BRIGHT SENT REGRETS OVER
AND WERE TAKEN BY HIM TO THE HERMITAGE HERE ALSO IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF OLD IRONSIDES STEWART IN A FRAME MADE FROM THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION IN WHICH GREAT VICTORIES WERE ACHIEVED BESIDES MANY PORTRAITS GIVEN BY FAMOUS PEOPLE WITH THEIR AUTOGRAPHS
THE DANISH KING URGED HIM TO RETURN TO COPENHAGEN BUT AS THE QUIRINAL WAS TO BE DECORATED WITH GREAT MAGNIFICENCE ROME COULD NOT SPARE HIM FOR THIS HE MADE IN THREE MONTHS HIS FAMOUS
THE CIRCULATION RUNNING UP TO NINETY THOUSAND THOUGH VERY LITTLE MONEY WAS MADE BUT IT GAVE MISTER GREELEY A REPUTATION IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR JOURNALISTIC ABILITY PRESIDENT HARRISON DIED AFTER HAVING BEEN A MONTH IN OFFICE
BECAUSE SO CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED HE WENT TO THE BIBLE HOUSE
WHEN HORACE WAS NEARLY TEN YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WHO HAD SPECULATED IN A SMALL WAY IN LUMBER BECAME A BANKRUPT HIS HOUSE AND FURNITURE WERE SOLD BY THE SHERIFF AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO FLEE FROM THE STATE TO AVOID ARREST
WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED UNDER HIS OWN HAND A LOW GRANITE COPING SURROUNDS THE GRAVE WHICH IS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH IVY
WHERE THE WELL KNOWN NEWSPAPER THE PUBLIC LEDGER WAS PUBLISHED HE WAS AMBITIOUS AS WHO IS NOT THAT COMES TO PROMINENCE AND ONE DAY HE MADE THE RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD SOMETIME BE THE OWNER OF THIS GREAT PAPER AND ITS BUILDING
WHEN TWO YEARS OLD HE WOULD PORE OVER THE BIBLE AS HE LAY ON THE FLOOR AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LETTERS AT THREE HE WENT TO THE DISTRICT SCHOOL OFTEN CARRIED THROUGH THE DEEP SNOW ON THE SHOULDERS OF ONE OF HIS AUNTS OR ON THE BACK OF AN OLDER BOY
HORACE WAS A TEETOTALER AND DESPISED CHEWING OR SMOKING TOBACCO WHICH HE REGARDED
HARD WORKING YET NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT AIDED BY A WIFE OF UNCOMMON ENERGY AND GOOD SPIRITS NOTWITHSTANDING HER MANY CARES BESIDES HER HOUSEWORK AND SPINNING AND MAKING THE CHILDREN'S CLOTHES SHE HOED IN THE GARDEN
AND STRUCK WITH THE GRANDEUR OF HIS MODEL OF JASON ASKED THE COST IN MARBLE SIX HUNDRED SEQUINS OVER TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE ANSWERED NOT DARING TO HOPE FOR SUCH GOOD FORTUNE THAT IS NOT ENOUGH
AND WANTED THE PAST BURIED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WAS OPPOSED TO THE HANGING OF JEFFERSON DAVIS AND WITH GERRITT SMITH A WELL KNOWN ABOLITIONIST AND ABOUT TWENTY OTHERS HE SIGNED MISTER DAVIS'S BAIL BOND FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE PRESSMAN AND EDITOR BOTH STOPPED THEIR LABORS TO WITNESS A FIGHT BUT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED FOR THE BOY NEVER TURNED FROM HIS WORK HE SOON LEFT HIS DESK SPENT AN HOUR IN WASHING THE INK FROM HIS HAIR
ON SUNDAY HE WENT TO CHURCH BOTH MORNING AND AFTERNOON LATE IN THE DAY A FRIEND WHO CALLED UPON THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE LEARNING THAT THE PRINTER WANTED WORK SAID HE HAD HEARD OF A VACANCY AT MISTER WEST'S
LAUREL ABOUT HIS BROW THE COFFIN ORNAMENTED WITH FLORAL CROWNS ONE MADE BY THE QUEEN OF DENMARK HIS CHISEL LAID IN THE MIDST OF LAUREL AND PALM AND HIS GREAT WORKS OF ART PLACED ABOUT HIM
LORD DUFFERIN SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE HERBERT SPENCER JOHN WALLER M P OF THE LONDON TIMES DEAN STANLEY THOMAS HUGHES DICKENS GRANT EVARTS
ON A GROUND OF VIOLETS FROM THE TRIBUNE WORKMEN A GIFT TO HONOR THE MAN WHO HONORED LABOR AND ENNOBLED FARM LIFE AT HIS COUNTRY HOME AT CHAPPAQUA A FEW MILES FROM NEW YORK AND THEN THROUGH AN ENORMOUS CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE
AN ARTIST COULD NOT LIVE ON PRAISE ALONE
HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST SLAVERY WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS ABLE PEN BUT HE ADVOCATED BUYING THE SLAVES FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN GOING TO WAR A CHEAPER METHOD THAN OUR SUBSEQUENT CONFLICT WITH ENORMOUS LOSS OF LIFE AND MONEY
THE MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMY CAME IN A BODY AND THE CROWD TOOK THE HORSES FROM THE CARRIAGE AND DREW IT THEMSELVES THROUGH THE STREETS TO THE PALACE OF CHARLOTTENBURG IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A GRAND TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
HOUSES WERE DRAPED IN BLACK BELLS TOLLED IN ALL THE CHURCHES
HE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY DOUBLED THE SUBSCRIPTION RATES LOWERED THE ADVERTISING EXCLUDED EVERYTHING QUESTIONABLE FROM THE COLUMNS OF HIS PAPER MADE HIS EDITORIALS BRIEF YET COMPREHENSIVE UNTIL UNDER HIS JUDICIOUS MANAGEMENT THE JOURNAL REACHED THE LARGE CIRCULATION
YOU SHOULD ASK EIGHT SAID THE GENEROUS MAN WHO AT ONCE ORDERED IT AND THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT IN BERTEL'S LIFE HOW OFTEN A RICH MAN MIGHT HELP A STRUGGLING ARTIST AND SAVE A GENIUS TO THE WORLD
THEY THEREFORE VOTED HIM TO BE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE SHOP AS USUAL THOUGH ALWAYS SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN HE WORE HIS POOR CLOTHES NO STOCKINGS AND HIS WRISTBANDS TIED TOGETHER WITH TWINE ONCE
ALLIBONE DEDICATED HIS GREAT WORK DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH AND AMERICAN AUTHORS TO THE ENERGETIC AND APPRECIATIVE YOUNG PUBLISHER HE HAD NOW ACQUIRED WEALTH SOONER ALMOST THAN HE COULD HAVE HOPED BEFORE HIM WERE BRIGHT PROSPECTS
BUT IT HAD A TRUE MAN AT ITS HEAD STRONG IN HIS HATRED OF SLAVERY AND THE OPPRESSION OF THE LABORING MAN AND FEARLESS IN THE ADVOCACY OF WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT SUCCESS DID NOT COME AT FIRST
RICH AND POOR MAIMED SOLDIERS AND WORKING PEOPLE PASSED IN ONE BY ONE TO LOOK UPON THE FAMILIAR FACE SAID ONE WORKMAN IT IS LITTLE ENOUGH TO LOSE A DAY FOR HORACE GREELEY WHO SPENT MANY A DAY WORKING FOR US
CANNON WERE FIRED POEMS READ CANTATAS SUNG AND THE KING CREATED HIM COUNCILLOR OF STATE
VISITING ON THE WAY ALEXANDER OF RUSSIA WHO AFTER THORWALDSEN HAD MADE HIS BUST PRESENTED THE ARTIST WITH A DIAMOND RING ALTHOUGH A PROTESTANT ACCOUNTED NOW THE GREATEST LIVING SCULPTOR
OF HOSPITALITY AND CULTURE HIS LIBRARY IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY THE WOOD WORK IS CARVED EBONY WITH GOLD THE BOOKSHELVES SIX FEET HIGH ON EVERY SIDE AND THE CEILING BUILT IN SUNKEN PANELS
THAT BOY WILL NEVER GET ALONG IN THE WORLD HE'LL NEVER KNOW MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COME IN WHEN IT RAINS ALAS FOR THE BLINDNESS OF ZACCHEUS GREELEY WHOSE NAME EVEN WOULD NOT BE REMEMBERED BUT FOR HIS ILLUSTRIOUS SON
MISTER CHILDS BIDS US TAKE OUR CHOICE OF SOME RARE CHINA CUPS AND SAUCERS WE CHOOSE ONE DAINTY WITH RED BIRDS AND CARRY IT AWAY AS A PLEASANT REMEMBRANCE OF A PRINCELY GIVER IN A PRINCELY APARTMENT
THE WHOLE CITY WAITED NEARLY THREE DAYS FOR HIS COMING BOATS DECKED WITH FLOWERS WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SO MANY CROWDED ON BOARD HIS VESSEL THAT IT WAS FEARED SHE WOULD SINK
HINTS TOWARD REFORM COMPOSED OF TEN LECTURES AND TWENTY ESSAYS THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE VISITED ENGLAND AS ONE OF THE JURY IN THE AWARDING OF PRIZES AND WHILE THERE MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF PHILANTHROPIC AND SOCIAL QUESTIONS
IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX A WORK ON HIS EMPIRE WITH HIS PICTURE AND HIS AUTOGRAPH GEORGE PEABODY SAT FOR A FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT FOR MISTER CHILDS THE ALBUM OF MISSUS CHILDS CONTAINS THE AUTOGRAPHS OF A GREAT NUMBER OF THE LEADING MEN AND WOMEN
HIS ONLY REMAINING CHILDREN IDA AND GABRIELLA STANDING BY HIS BEDSIDE I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH AND AT HALF PAST THREE IT IS DONE HE WAS READY FOR THE GREAT CHANGE HE HAD WRITTEN ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE
THAT HE FELL UPON THE OLD MAN'S NECK AND EMBRACED HIM HEARTILY AFTER SOME OF THE GRANDEST WORK OF HIS LIFE IN THE FRUE KIRKE CHRIST AND THE TWELVE APOSTLES AND OTHERS HE RETURNED TO ROME
KNOWING HE SAYS NO HUMAN BEING WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILES HIS FIRST NEED WAS A BOARDING PLACE OVER A SALOON KEPT BY AN IRISHMAN HE FOUND ROOM AND BOARD FOR TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF A WEEK FORTUNATELY
HE LISTENS COURTEOUSLY TO ANY REQUESTS AND THEN BIDS YOU MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME IN THIS ELEGANT OFFICE THAT CERTAINLY HAS NO SUPERIOR IN THE WORLD PERHAPS NO RIVAL
SETTING UP THE WORDS WITHOUT WRITING THEM OUT HE SOON JOINED A DEBATING SOCIETY COMPOSED OF THE BEST INFORMED PERSONS OF THE LITTLE TOWN OF EAST POULTNEY THE MINISTER THE DOCTOR THE LAWYER THE SCHOOLTEACHERS AND THE LIKE
SOME OF THE NEW YORK JOURNALS FOUGHT THE NEW SHEET BUT IT LIVED AND GREW TILL ON THE SEVENTH WEEK IT HAD ELEVEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS A GOOD BUSINESS MANAGER WAS OBTAINED AS PARTNER
HAS A LITTLE PLANETARIUM ATTACHED AND NEARLY SIX THOUSAND TEETH IN WHEELS IT WAS MADE FOR JOSEPH POTTS WHO PAID SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE SPANISH MINISTER IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OFFERED EIGHT HUNDRED FOR IT THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT IT TO HIS SOVEREIGN
WHICH BESIDES THE TIME OF DAY GIVES THE PHASES OF THE MOON THE DAYS OF THE WEEK AND THE MONTH ANOTHER A CLOCK CONSTRUCTED BY DAVID RITTENHOUSE THE ASTRONOMER OF THE REVOLUTION IN THE OLD COLONIAL DAYS WHICH PLAYS A GREAT VARIETY OF MUSIC
ON THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE APPRENTICES TOOK A LARGE BLACK BALL USED TO PUT INK ON THE TYPE AND REMARKING THAT HORACE'S HAIR WAS TOO LIGHT DAUBED HIS HEAD FOUR TIMES
FIFTH AVENUE BEING BLOCKED FOR A MILE THE BODY WAS BORNE TO GREENWOOD CEMETERY STORES WERE CLOSED AND HOUSES ALONG THE ROUTE WERE DRAPED IN BLACK FLAGS ON THE SHIPPING IN THE HARBOR WERE AT HALF MAST
WHILE REJECTING WITHOUT QUESTION ALL OTHERS WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT CANNOT BE BECAUSE OF ANY SUPERIORITY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FORMER SINCE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE LATTER IS IN MANY CASES INFINITELY GREATER AND BETTER AUTHENTICATED
AND AS THESE THREE MEN COULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DID IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GLORIOUS WORK WITHOUT A WELL KNOWN INSPIRATION A FOURTH MEMORIAL THE GRANDEST OF ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERECTED TO THE DEVIL
WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE WONDERFUL STORY RECOUNTED BY PLUTARCH IN HIS TREATISE ON THE CESSATION OF THE ORACLES HOW
IS NOT ONLY THE LARGEST BUT ALSO THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF ANIMALS
ONE IS ASHAMED OF REPEATING THESE THINGS FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED OCCASIONALLY
THE OLD MAN ASKED WITH THE MOST LIVELY INTEREST AND EVEN WITH A CERTAIN ANXIETY ABOUT AN ANCIENT TEMPLE WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN OF OLD THE GRANDEST IN ALL GREECE NONE OF HIS HEARERS RECOGNISED THE NAME WHICH HE PRONOUNCED WITH TENDER EMOTION AT LAST
BUT PAINED AS I HAD BEEN BY THE OUTRAGE WREAKED UPON THE POOR WHALES MY SOUL WAS INFINITELY MORE TROUBLED BY THE TRAGICAL FATE OF THIS OLD MAN WHO ACCORDING TO THE MYTHOLOGICAL THEORY OF THE LEARNED RUSSIAN
HE CURED MANY SICK IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD HEALTH HE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS IF GOD WHY DID HE MAKE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS AT ALL
REIGNED FOR A LONG SERIES OF YEARS ON THE SUMMIT OF OLYMPUS
NIELS ANDERSEN BORN AT DRONTHEIM IN NORWAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST SKILFUL AND INTREPID WHALERS I HAVE EVER KNOWN IT IS TO HIM THAT I AM INDEBTED FOR WHAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE OF THE WHALE FISHERY
SEIZED WITH NAUSEA IT VOMITED HIM AFTER THREE DAYS MOST CERTAINLY THAT PROVES THE ABSENCE OF ALL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT IN THESE MONSTERS THE WHALE THEREFORE WOULD NEVER CHOOSE AN ICE BLOCK FOR PRAYER CUSHION
THE VOICE GROWN YET LOUDER AND MORE TERRIBLE
THEY SAW WELL THAT HE KNEW PERFECTLY THE LOCALITIES OF THE COUNTRY
HE SHOWED ME HOW YOU SHOULD FIX THE KNEE OF THE RIGHT LEG AGAINST THE GUN WHALE OF THE BOAT WHEN LAUNCHING THE HARPOON AND HOW WITH THE LEFT LEG YOU LAUNCH A VIGOROUS KICK AT THE IMBECILE SAILOR WHO DON'T PAY OUT QUICKLY ENOUGH THE ROPE ATTACHED TO THE HARPOON TO HIM I OWE ALL
THE CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY AND SYSTEM AMONG OTHERS BECAUSE INEFFABLY ABSURD WHERE IS THE HEAVEN FOR ITS GOD WHERE THE HELL FOR ITS DEVIL WHERE IS ABOVE WHERE BENEATH
NO REMEDY AVAILS AND YOU CARRY THEM ABOUT WITH YOU TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS RUSH AS YOU WILL TO THE NORTH AND TO THE SOUTH
MIRACULOUSLY ANNOUNCED WAS THE PAN OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS CHRIST HAD DIED BUT ONLY PRO TEM HAD DESCENDED INTO HELL BUT WITH A RETURN TICKET
WHAT DISCIPLE COULD BE EXPECTED TO REPORT PERFECTLY THE WORDS OF A TEACHER SO MYSTICALLY SUBLIME THE DISCIPLE INTENDS AND ENDEAVORS TO REPORT FAITHFULLY
I CAN NO LONGER GIVE MY ESTEEM TO ANY EDUCATED MAN WHO HAS INVESTIGATED AND STILL PROFESSES THIS RELIGION WITHOUT GRAVE DEDUCTION AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS HEART HIS INTELLECT OR HIS CONSCIENCE
WHOSE VISIBLE TANGIBLE LIVING AND SPEAKING EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT MISGIVING BY THE NON SCIENTIFIC EARLY CHRISTIANS
HE SHOWED LESS SATISFACTION WHEN THEY TOLD HIM THAT THIS CHRISTIAN SYMBOL HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE CRESCENT THE MOST SINGULAR THING WAS THAT NONE OF THE SEAMEN KNEW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS CONCERNING WHICH HE QUESTIONED THEM AND WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAD BEEN FLOURISHING CITIES IN HIS TIME
WHEN A LOUD AND TERRIBLE VOICE FROM THE LAND CALLED THAMOUS THE PILOT AND HE HAVING RESPONDED AT THE THIRD APPEAL
AND WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM EVEN PETER WON'T DENY HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAS RESTORED PETER'S MOTHER IN LAW TO LIFE THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE
HAVE PERHAPS BEEN DEGRADED BY THE REPORTER
ALL THIS BEAUTY OF THE CREATION IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE GOOD DOMINIE IS A PROOF OF THE POWER OF GOD WHICH INFLUENCES EVERY LIVING CREATURE SO THAT NOT ONLY MAN BUT LIKEWISE A GREAT BRUTE OF A FISH RAVISHED BY THIS SPECTACLE ADORES THE CREATOR
WHAT CAN BE THE REASON IS IT THAT THEY CANNOT FIND A CHURCH SUFFICIENTLY SPACIOUS TO AFFORD THEM ENTRANCE INTO ITS PALE NOR HAVE THE WHALES ANY TASTE FOR THE PROPHETS AND THE ONE WHICH SWALLOWED JONAH WAS NOT ABLE TO DIGEST THAT GREAT PREACHER
THE UNSOULING OF NATURE BOUND IN IRON CHAINS BY ARID NUMBER AND RIGOROUS RULE BUT GOES ON TO CELEBRATE THE RESURRECTION OF HUMANITY IN CHRIST
AND WHICH NOW CONTINUED TO NOURISH HIM WITH ITS MILK IN THE ISLE OF RABBITS SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF NIELS ANDERSEN AND IT MADE MY HEART BLEED I WILL NOT DISSEMBLE
AND MISERABLY MUFFLED IN RABBIT SKINS HE WAS SEATED UPON A STONE SETTLE AND WARMED HIS THIN HANDS AND TREMBLING KNEES AT THE GRATE WHERE SOME BRUSHWOOD WAS BURNING AT HIS RIGHT HAND STOOD A MONSTROUSLY LARGE BIRD WHICH SEEMED TO BE AN EAGLE
WHEN HE HAD MINUTELY DESCRIBED THE PLACE WHERE THIS MONUMENT STOOD A YOUNG SEAMAN SUDDENLY RECOGNISED THE SPOT THE VILLAGE WHERE I WAS BORN HE EXCLAIMED IS SITUATED PRECISELY THERE DURING MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE LONG WATCHED THERE THE PIGS OF MY FATHER
THE WHALE TRIES TO MITIGATE HIS PANGS BY PLACING HIMSELF AGAINST THE PROTRUDING AND SHARP ANGLES OF A ROCK OF ICE AND BY THERE RASPING HIS BACK WITH A REAL FERVOR AND WITH VIGOROUS MOVEMENTS UP AND DOWN
CONFIDENT THAT TO NOT ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS COULD THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST GIVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SATISFACTORY ANSWER AS THE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT IS PRESENTED TO US GOD SACRIFICED HIS ONLY SON
SHOUTS HARSH PURITANICAL SCORN ON THE ORACLES STRICKEN DUMB AND THE DEITIES OVERTHROWN SHELLEY IN A MAGNIFICENT CHORUS OF HELLAS
I AM CONTENT TO NOTE ONE ASPECT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MYSTERY WHICH SO FAR AS I AM AWARE HAS BEEN SELDOM STUDIED THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT AS PLANNED BY GOD IS BASED UPON A CRIME
I HAVE ONLY ENCOUNTERED VULGAR STOCKFISH AND MISERABLE HERRINGS OF WHAT USE IS THE BEST HARPOON WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH A HERRING NOW THAT MY LIMBS ARE PARALYSED I MUST RENOUNCE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF PURSUING WHALES
BUT THE OLD MAN COULD GIVE THEM BUT SCANT INFORMATION
HOW CAN OUR HUMANITY IMITATE DEITY AND FINALLY A QUESTION TRAMPLING DOWN EVERY ASSERTION IN HIS FAVOR
IF JESUS HAD ASCENDED AND CONTINUED TO ASCEND WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT HE MIGHT BE ASCENDING NOW
HAD HE LIVED IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A WISE MAN ONLY ATTACKS THE ERRORS THAT ARE IN HIS WAY THINGS WHICH HE NEVER MEETS HE CAN SCARCELY THINK OF AS OBSTRUCTIONS
GREAT SLABS OF MARBLE SQUARED FRAGMENTS OF WALL AND TRIANGULAR PIECES OF ROOFING ARE SCATTERED ABOUT HALF BURIED IN THE EARTH I HAVE OFTEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN PASSED HOURS AT A TIME IN EXAMINING THE COMBATS AND THE GAMES
BUT THE WORLD EVEN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNGRATEFUL TO ITS MOST GENEROUS BENEFACTORS IS IT NOT THE WORST OF SACRILEGE A FOUL PROFANATION OF OUR HUMAN NATURE
AND AFTER ALL NOTHING WILL REMAIN AT THE END BUT A DECREPIT OLD MAN WHO TO GAIN HIS MISERABLE LIVELIHOOD HAS TO TURN DEALER IN RABBIT SKINS LIKE ANY POOR SAVOYARD
AND THAT WAS MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THESE SAILORS REACHED IT WITH THEIR SHIP THEY FOUND IT DESERTED AND UNCULTIVATED SICKLY STALKS OF BROOM SWAYED SADLY UPON THE QUICKSANDS
BE ADORED BY A HUNDRED NATIONS DURING LONG CENTURIES BE THE LOVER OF SEMELE OF DANAE OF EUROPA OF ALCMENA
THE SHE GOAT MOANED AND LICKED THE HANDS OF HER MASTER WHOSE SORROWS SHE SEEMED TRYING TO COMFORT BY HER HUMBLE CARESSES AT THIS SIGHT A STRANGE TROUBLE SWELLED IN THE HEARTS OF THE SEAMEN THEY HASTILY QUITTED THE HUT
WHICH WITH IMPERIOUS AND EVEN MAJESTIC DIGNITY HELD ITSELF ERECT IN SPITE OF THE WEIGHT OF YEARS SO THAT THE HEAD REACHED THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF HIS LINEAMENTS THOUGH WORN AND RAVAGED CONSERVED TRACES OF BEAUTY
WITH A SNAP OF HIS TEETH SINCE THEN POOR NIELS ANDERSEN WENT LIMPING UPON AN ARTIFICIAL LEG MANUFACTURED FROM ONE OF THE FIRS OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHICH HE EXTOLLED AS A MASTERPIECE OF NORWEGIAN CARPENTRY HIS GREATEST PLEASURE AT THIS PERIOD
THE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS BELIEF IN THIS ARE SHOCKED AT THE OUTRAGE OFFERED TO OUR HUMANITY BY THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY WHILE THEY THEMSELVES COMMIT THIS OUTRAGE MORE FLAGITIOUS LITTLE MATTERS WHENCE WE SPRANG
BUT WHO WAS MOREOVER GUILTY OF INCEST AND OTHER INFAMOUS VICES THAT IN THEIR BLINDNESS THE IDOLATORS HAD NEVERTHELESS IMMOLATED OXEN
WAS EVIDENTLY THE FAMOUS EAGLE WHICH USED TO BEAR THE THUNDERBOLTS IN ITS TALONS AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE GOAT WAS THE OLD NURSE AMALTHEA WHICH HAD OF OLD SUCKLED THE GOD IN THE ISLE OF CRETE
WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO QUIT THEIR HOLES THESE BANQUETS OF VERMIN AT LENGTH TROUBLE THEIR INVOLUNTARY HOST AND EVEN CAUSE HIM EXCESSIVE SUFFERINGS NOT HAVING HANDS AS WE HAVE WHO GOD BE THANKED CAN SCRATCH OURSELVES WHEN WE FEEL AN ITCHING
AND LAMENTATIONS IN ALL THE MACHINE OF THE UNIVERSE HEAVENS EARTH SEA HELLS WITH THIS MY INTERPRETATION THE TIME AGREES FOR THAT MOST GOOD
NAY WHAT BIBLIOLATER HAS EVER SERIOUSLY WEIGHED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE MIRACLES OF HIS FELLOW CHRISTIAN THE GREAT SAINT BERNARD SUCH AS THOSE WHICH ARE MINUTELY RELATED AND SOLEMNLY ATTESTED BY TEN EYE WITNESSES
A CABIN THE ONLY ONE THEY DISCOVERED ANNOUNCED THE PRESENCE OF A HUMAN BEING WHEN THE MARINERS HAD ENTERED THE HUT THEY SAW AN OLD MAN
LIVES IN THE RELATIVE AND THE CONDITIONED AND NATURALLY REFLECTS THE CHARACTER OF THIS SPHERE THE WISE MAN FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED AND OBSTRUCTED BY CERTAIN CONCRETE ERRORS
WHY DID HE LET ANY REMAIN POOR AND IGNORANT HE REBUKED THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES IT GOD WHY DID HE NOT WHOLLY PURIFY THEM FROM FORMALISM HYPOCRISY AND UNBELIEF
WE ARE WHAT WE ARE BUT MUCH MATTERS TO WHAT WE MAY ATTAIN IF THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY PLANTS OUR FEET IN THE SLIME THE CHRISTIAN THEORY BOWS OUR HEAD TO THE DUST
AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHICH SLEPT AROSE AND CAME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY
THE HEAVENLY TRINITY WOULD NOT HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THE SCHEME OF SALVATION BY ATONEMENT JUDAS CAIAPHAS
IT HAS BEEN OFTEN REMARKED THAT COPERNICUS AND KEPLER AND NEWTON HAVE DESTROYED ALL THE OLD MYTHOLOGIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE MYTHOLOGY OF BOTH THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS WITH THE EARTH NO LONGER THE UNIVERSE OF MORTAL LIFE
HAS RETAINED THE THRONE OF TARTARUS THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN MORE LUCKY THAN THEIR BROTHER JUPITER WHO HAD TO SUFFER SPECIALLY THE VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE THIS THIRD SON OF SATURN WHO AFTER THE FALL OF HIS SIRE ASSUMED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE HEAVENS
PROPPING THEMSELVES AGAINST A CLIFF OF ICE INDULGED IN MOVEMENTS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE WE REMARK IN THE ORATORIES OF THE VARIOUS RELIGIOUS SECTS
IMMENSELY LARGER AND MORE VORACIOUS THAN THE RATS OF THE MAINLAND LEAD JOYOUS LIFE UNDER THE SKIN OF THE WHALE
FOR HE DESCRIBED CLEARLY AND EXACTLY THE GULFS THE PENINSULAS THE CAPES OFTEN EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT HILLS AND ISOLATED GROUPS OF ROCKS HIS IGNORANCE OF THE COMMONEST TYPOGRAPHICAL NAMES THEREFORE ASTONISHED THEM ALL THE MORE
BUT PAN THE GREAT LIVES AGAIN AS MISTER MACCALL TOLD US IN SOME LINES PUBLISHED IN THIS PAPER SEVERAL YEARS AGO PAN LIVES NOT AS A GOD BUT AS THE ALL NATURE
CONTESTS NOT THE JUSTICE OF THEIR DOOM WHILE IN THE FINAL CHORUS HE PREDICTS THE SAME DOOM FOR THEIR CONQUEROR IN HIS TURN IN OUR OWN DAY
AND MY DEEP REVERENCE FOR RABELAIS WITH WHOM NO COMMENTATOR IN HOLY ORDERS KNOWN TO ME CAN BE COMPARED EXCEPT DEAN SWIFT I AM INCLINED ON THIS POINT TO FOLLOW THE ORDINARY OPINION THAT PAN THE GREAT GOD WHOSE DEATH WAS THUS
HE ACCEPTS THE JEWISH MIRACLES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME DOWN TO HIM THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OF HIS FOREFATHERS INVESTED WITH A GLAMOR OF SANCTITY AND HE REGARDS THEM WITH THE EYE OF FAITH WHICH SEES AND SEES NOT
WHEN AT RITZEBUTTEL NEAR CUXHAVEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF NIELS ANDERSEN HE WAS SCARCELY MORE NIMBLE HIMSELF FOR OFF THE COAST OF SENEGAL A YOUNG SHARK WHICH NO DOUBT TOOK HIS RIGHT LEG FOR A STICK OF BARLEY SUGAR HAD SNAPPED IT OFF
WHY DID THEIR RISEN LORD ONLY SLINK ABOUT AMONG HIS OWN DISCIPLES APPEARING TO THESE BUT AT FLYING INSTANTS WHY DID HE NOT WITH HIS WELL KNOWN FEATURES AND WITH THE WOUNDS OF THE NAILS AND THE SPEAR IN HIS BODY
AND THE CHARACTER WHEREIN IT HAS BEEN FOUNDED TAKING AWAY ALL TRUE GRANDEUR FROM JESUS BENUMBING OUR LOVE AND REVERENCE JESUS AS A MAN COMMANDS MY HEART'S BEST HOMAGE
TO WHOM MIRACLES APPEARED AMONG THE MOST FREQUENT OCCURRENCES OF LIFE SO COULD THE ASCENSION THEIR EARTH WAS A PLANE VAULTED BY THE SKY LAMPED BY THE LITTLE SUN AND MOON AND STARS
AND DID NOT FEEL AT EASE UNTIL THEY COULD NO MORE HEAR THE SOBBINGS OF THE OLD MAN THE CROAKINGS OF THE HIDEOUS BIRD AND THE BLEATINGS OF THE GOAT WHEN THEY GOT ON BOARD THEIR VESSEL AGAIN THEY RELATED THEIR ADVENTURES AMONG THE CREW THERE CHANCED TO BE A SCHOLAR
JESUS ON HIS CROSS MUST DWINDLE TO A POINT EVEN IN THE REALMS OF LEGEND UNDER PROMETHEUS ON CAUCASUS FOR AGES ALREADY THE FATHER HAS BEEN AS SPECTRAL AS JUPITER
RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF JESUS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN REVIEWING MISTER R H HUTTON'S ESSAY ON CHRISTIAN EVIDENCES POPULAR AND CRITICAL
BUT WHEN HE HEARS WORDS WHICH TO HIM ARE WITHOUT SENSE BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS SOME TRUTH WHOSE SPHERE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS VISION HE MAKES SENSE OF THEM BY SOME SLIGHT CHANGE SLIGHT
BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT OF HIS DEEPEST REGRETS THE BANISHED DIVINITIES AND SINCE THE HALLS OF OLYMPUS ARE VOID APPEALS TO NATURE TO RESTORE TO HIS SPIRIT ITS FIRST FIRE IF SHE INDEED LIVES
AND DEITY REPORTS THE SPEECHES ALL SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE TRUTH TRANSPARENTLY SELF CONSISTENT ELSE WHAT ADVANTAGE OR GAIN HAVE WE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF GOD FOR MAN
ON THIS SITE THERE ARE IN FACT THE RUINS OF VERY ANCIENT CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY MAGNIFICENT HERE AND THERE YOU SEE SOME COLUMNS STILL ERECT THEY ARE ISOLATED OR CONNECTED BY FRAGMENTS OF ROOFING
AND WHO THOUGH VALIANTLY DEFYING SCIENCE SEEKS TO CONCILIATE HISTORICAL POSSIBILITY FINDS HIS TASK QUITE HEAVY ENOUGH IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACTS
WERE RECORDED OF ANY OTHER THAN JESUS IN ANY OTHER SACRED BOOK THAN THE BIBLE MISTER HUTTON AND ALL OTHER INTELLIGENT CHRISTIANS WOULD NOT ONLY DISBELIEVE IT BUT WOULD NOT EVEN CONDESCEND TO INVESTIGATE IT
HE FEELS READY TO FIGHT FOR THE FORMER AGAINST THESE THIS CHANGE OF THE CELESTIAL DYNASTY IS INDEED A FAVORITE THEME WITH HIM ELSEWHERE HE PICTURES THE OLYMPIANS HOLDING HIGH REVELRY
THE POETS HAVE CHANTED THIS MOMENTOUS REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THEIR RELIGION THEIR PHANTASY OR THEIR MOOD MILTON IN HIS HYMN ON THE NATIVITY
IS THE HISTORY TOLD ME LONG AGO BY MY FRIEND NIELS ANDERSEN I HAVE JUST MENTIONED NIELS ANDERSEN AND THIS GOOD FIGURE AT ONCE SO DROLL AND SO LOVABLE
IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT REVEAL IT AT ONCE TO ALL MEN AND SO REVEAL IT THAT DOUBT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HE LIVED AN EXAMPLE OF HOLINESS TO US ALL IF GOD
JESUS AS GOD
WE ARE SURELY AT THE UTMOST LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE IN CONCEIVING THAT JESUS COULD APPEAR UNTO FIVE HUNDRED OF THE BRETHREN AT ONCE THERE IS NO HINT ELSEWHERE THAT HE HAD SO MANY PERMANENT FOLLOWERS IN HIS LIFETIME
