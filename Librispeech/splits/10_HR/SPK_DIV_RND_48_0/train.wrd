FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
CLOTH'D IN ONE LIVERY OF A SOLEMN AND GREAT FRATERNITY
IN GRENADE AT THE SIEGE EKE HAD HE BE OF ALGESIR
THE DEVIL OF HELLE SET HIS FOOT THEREIN
AND FOR TO DRINK STRONG WINE AS RED AS BLOOD THEN WOULD HE SPEAK AND CRY AS HE WERE WOOD
AND NOTHING BY WOMEN FOR MEN HAVE EVER A LIK'ROUS APPETITE ON LOWER THINGS TO PERFORM THEIR DELIGHT THAN ON THEIR WIVES BE THEY NEVER SO FAIR
WHAT NEEDETH IT HIS FEATURES TO DESCRIVE
NO BEARD HAD HE NOR EVER ONE SHOULD HAVE
SHE HADDE PASSED MANY A STRANGE STREAM AT ROME SHE HAD BEEN AND AT BOLOGNE
SHE WAS A WORTHY WOMAN ALL HER LIVE HUSBANDS AT THE CHURCH DOOR HAD SHE HAD FIVE WITHOUTEN OTHER COMPANY IN YOUTH
AND ERE THAT HE AGAIN WERE IN THE SADDLE THERE WAS GREAT SHOVING BOTHE TO AND FRO TO LIFT HIM UP AND MUCHE CARE AND WOE SO UNWIELDY WAS THIS SILLY PALED GHOST AND TO THE MANCIPLE THEN SPAKE OUR HOST BECAUSE THAT DRINK HATH DOMINATION UPON THIS MAN
BUT RICH HE WAS OF HOLY THOUGHT AND WERK WORK HE WAS ALSO A LEARNED MAN A CLERK THAT CHRISTE'S GOSPEL TRULY WOULDE PREACH
THE HOT SUMMER HAD MADE HIS HUE ALL BROWN AND CERTAINLY HE WAS A GOOD FELLAW
AND ON THAT OTHER SIDE A GAY DAGGERE
SO AS IT SEEMED ME AND WHICH THEY WEREN AND OF WHAT DEGREE AND EKE IN WHAT ARRAY THAT THEY WERE IN AND AT A KNIGHT THEN WILL I FIRST BEGIN A KNIGHT THERE WAS AND THAT A WORTHY MAN
BUT NOW TO PURPOSE AS I FIRST BEGAN THIS WORTHY PHOEBUS DID ALL THAT HE CAN TO PLEASE HER WEENING THROUGH SUCH PLEASANCE AND FOR HIS MANHOOD AND HIS GOVERNANCE THAT NO MAN SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM FROM HER GRACE
AND AFTER THAT THUS SPAKE HE TO THE CROW TRAITOR QUOTH HE WITH TONGUE OF SCORPION THOU HAST ME BROUGHT TO MY CONFUSION ALAS THAT I WAS WROUGHT
SO GREAT A PURCHASER WAS NOWHERE NONE ALL WAS FEE SIMPLE TO HIM
THE MANCIPLE'S TALE THE PROLOGUE
WAS WONT TO BEAREN IN HIS HAND A BOW NOW HAD THIS PHOEBUS IN HIS HOUSE A CROW WHICH IN A CAGE HE FOSTER'D MANY A DAY AND TAUGHT IT SPEAKEN AS MEN TEACH A JAY WHITE WAS THIS CROW AS IS A SNOW WHITE SWAN AND COUNTERFEIT THE SPEECH OF EVERY MAN HE COULDE
PURSE IS THE ARCHEDEACON'S HELL SAID HE
NOW LET US RIDE AND HEARKEN WHAT I SAY
AND TOLD HIM OFT HE SAW IT WITH HIS EYEN
OF NORFOLK WAS THIS REEVE OF WHICH I TELL
SHE LET NO MORSEL FROM HER LIPPES FALL
BUT HE WAS LIKE A MASTER OR A POPE
BUT GOD IT WOT THERE MAY NO MAN EMBRACE AS TO DISTRAIN A THING
THE CUT FELL TO THE KNIGHT OF WHICH FULL BLITHE AND GLAD WAS EVERY WIGHT AND TELL HE MUST HIS TALE AS WAS REASON BY FORWORD AND BY COMPOSITION AS YE HAVE HEARD WHAT NEEDETH WORDES MO AND WHEN THIS GOOD MAN SAW THAT IT WAS SO
FULL OFTEN TIME HE HAD THE BOARD BEGUN ABOVE ALLE NATIONS IN PRUSSE SEVEN
NE WAS THERE SUCH ANOTHER PARDONERE
MY WIT IS SHORT YE MAY WELL UNDERSTAND GREAT CHEERE MADE OUR HOST US EVERY ONE AND TO THE SUPPER SET HE US ANON AND SERVED US WITH VICTUAL OF THE BEST
AND AT SATALIE WHEN THEY WERE WON AND IN THE GREATE SEA AT MANY A NOBLE ARMY HAD HE BE AT MORTAL BATTLES HAD HE BEEN FIFTEEN AND FOUGHTEN FOR OUR FAITH AT TRAMISSENE
THAT OF HER SMILING WAS FULL SIMPLE AND COY
AND PICARDIE AND BORNE HIM WELL
AN HOUSEHOLDER AND THAT A GREAT WAS HE
AND ON HER HEAD AN HAT AS BROAD AS IS A BUCKLER OR A TARGE A FOOT MANTLE ABOUT HER HIPPES LARGE
HE WAS THEREWITH FULL FILL'D OF GENTLENESS OF HONOUR AND OF PERFECT WORTHINESS
HE KNEW THE CAUSE OF EVERY MALADY WERE IT OF COLD OR HOT OR MOIST OR DRY
AND LEFT HIS SHEEP EUCUMBER'D IN THE MIRE
DAMASCENE AND CONSTANTIN
SO THAT THE WOLF NE MADE IT NOT MISCARRY HE WAS A SHEPHERD AND NO MERCENARY
NOW LORDINGES TRULY YE BE TO ME WELCOME RIGHT HEARTILY FOR BY MY TROTH IF THAT I SHALL NOT LIE I SAW NOT THIS YEAR SUCH A COMPANY AT ONCE IN THIS HERBEROW
FOR IT WAS OF NO SUPERFLUITY
BUT ALL FOR NOUGHT FOR IT AVAILETH NOUGHT A GOOD WIFE THAT IS CLEAN OF WORK AND THOUGHT
AWAKE THOU COOK QUOTH HE GOD GIVE THEE SORROW
HIS ARROWS DROOPED NOT WITH FEATHERS LOW
NOT ONE WORD SPAKE HE MORE THAN WAS NEED AND THAT WAS SAID IN FORM AND REVERENCE AND SHORT AND QUICK AND FULL OF HIGH SENTENCE SOUNDING IN MORAL VIRTUE WAS HIS SPEECH AND GLADLY WOULD HE LEARN AND GLADLY TEACH A SERGEANT OF THE LAW
HIS BOOTES SUPPLE HIS HORSE IN GREAT ESTATE NOW CERTAINLY HE WAS A FAIR PRELATE
SIR KNIGHT QUOTH HE MY MASTER AND MY LORD NOW DRAW THE CUT FOR THAT IS MINE ACCORD COME NEAR QUOTH HE MY LADY PRIORESS AND YE SIR CLERK LET BE YOUR SHAMEFASTNESS NOR STUDY NOT LAY HAND TO EVERY MAN
THAT IF GOLD RUSTE WHAT SHOULD IRON DO
AND CERTAINLY HE HAD A MERRY NOTE
DISCREET HE WAS AND OF GREAT REVERENCE HE SEEMED SUCH HIS WORDES WERE SO WISE
WELL WIST HE BY THE DROUGHT AND BY THE RAIN THE YIELDING OF HIS SEED AND OF HIS GRAIN
BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
A NICKEL PLATED EMPEROR TIP AWOKE SOON AFTER DAWN BUT THE SCARECROW HAD ALREADY RISEN AND PLUCKED WITH HIS CLUMSY FINGERS A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF RIPE BERRIES FROM SOME BUSHES NEAR BY
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
I'M SURE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME REPLIED THE BOY THE SAW HORSE NOW AMBLED FORWARD AT A PACE SO FAST THAT ITS RIDERS HAD HARD WORK TO STICK UPON ITS BACK SO THERE WAS LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
AND IT WAS THE MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SCRATCHED DURING MY ADVENTUROUS EXPERIENCES YOU WILL OBSERVE THIS ENGRAVED STAR UPON MY LEFT BREAST IT NOT ONLY INDICATES WHERE MY EXCELLENT HEART LIES BUT
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
COVERING TIP AND THE WOGGLE BUG AND JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD AND BEGAN TEARING IT AWAY AND FLYING OFF WITH IT ONLY TO LET IT DROP STRAW BY STRAW INTO THE GREAT GULF BENEATH THE SCARECROW'S HEAD NOTING WITH DISMAY THIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS INTERIOR
I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
BUT IN A KINDLY SYMPATHETIC TONE DO NOT I BEG OF YOU DAMPEN TODAY'S SUN WITH THE SHOWERS OF TOMORROW FOR BEFORE YOUR HEAD HAS TIME TO SPOIL YOU CAN HAVE IT CANNED AND IN THAT WAY IT MAY BE PRESERVED INDEFINITELY
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
YES SAID TIP
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
AND AFTERWARD THE LITTLE PARTY RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
THE SOLDIER HASTENED TO DO THIS WHILE TIP WHO HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HEELS REMAINED IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW WITH WONDERING EYES HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED TO THROW THE QUOITS
AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
ARE YOUR SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED MY DEAR FRIEND I CANNOT SAY WAS THE REPLY FOR THE GIRLS OF OZ HAVE RISEN IN REVOLT AND DRIVEN ME OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY GREAT GOODNESS CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN WHAT A CALAMITY
THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
THEY SURELY DO NOT COMPLAIN OF YOUR WISE AND GRACIOUS RULE NO BUT THEY SAY IT IS A POOR RULE THAT DON'T WORK BOTH WAYS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW AND THESE FEMALES ARE ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT MEN HAVE RULED THE LAND LONG ENOUGH
EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
WE OWE YOU MANY THANKS FOR THE GALLANT FIGHT YOU MADE I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ESCAPED VERY NICELY REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A TONE OF PRIDE NOT SO EXCLAIMED A HOLLOW VOICE
OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
WHY THE THREE PILLS ARE IN THE BOX AGAIN SAID THE SCARECROW OF COURSE THEY ARE THE WOGGLE BUG DECLARED
THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
SCARECROW BECAME GREATLY ANIMATED AT THIS SIGHT AND EXCLAIMED HOW DELIGHTED I SHALL BE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AGAIN
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
RETURNED NICK WELL PLEASED MY HEART IS QUITE THE BEST PART OF ME BUT NOW LET US START UPON OUR JOURNEY THEY PERCHED THE ONE LEGGED PUMPKINHEAD UPON THE SAW HORSE AND TIED HIM TO HIS SEAT WITH CORDS
TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
ADDED THE SCARECROW YOUR MATHEMATICS SEEM TO ME VERY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MIXED PICKLES THE MORE YOU FISH FOR WHAT YOU WANT THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING IT I AM CERTAIN THAT IF THE THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL IT IS IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE

HANNAH BELL WANTED TO BE GOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT MARJORY WHITE AGED TEN WANTED TO BE A WIDOW QUESTIONED WHY SHE GRAVELY SAID THAT IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED PEOPLE CALLED YOU AN OLD MAID AND IF YOU WERE YOUR HUSBAND BOSSED YOU

IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
BUT I CAN'T HELP LOVING PAUL IRVING THE BEST OF ALL MINE I DON'T THINK IT DOES ANY HARM THOUGH FOR EVERYBODY LOVES PAUL EVEN MISSUS LYNDE WHO SAYS SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED SHE'D GET SO FOND OF A YANKEE THE OTHER BOYS IN SCHOOL LIKE HIM TOO
ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
AND I MEAN TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM I HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THEM EXCEPT GRANDMA AND FATHER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS SO THERE IS NO USE IN TELLING THEM
AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED
I PUT TEACHER WHERE HE PUT LADY AND I PUT IN SOMETHING OF MY OWN WHEN I COULD THINK OF IT AND I CHANGED SOME WORDS I PUT DRESS IN PLACE OF MOOD
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
AND PIPING A QUAINT LITTLE MELODY AMONG THE TWISTED FIRS BELOW THE GARDEN TURNED HER DREAMY FACE OVER HER SHOULDER THE TROUBLE IS YOU AND MISSUS LYNDE DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER SHE EXPLAINED THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT IS WRONG WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
HE IS OLL STRIPED AND HE GOT ONE OF HIS EARS FROZ OF LAST WINTER ONLY FOR THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD LOOKING CAT MY UNKLE HAS ADOPTED A CAT IT COME TO HIS HOUSE ONE DAY AND WOUDENT GO AWAY AND UNKLE SAYS IT HAS FORGOT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE EVER KNOWED
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
SAINT CLAIR SAYS HE CAN HIT THE HARDEST BUT PAUL CAN HIT THE OFTENEST PAUL'S LETTER MY DEAR TEACHER YOU TOLD US WE MIGHT WRITE YOU ABOUT SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE WE KNEW I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MY ROCK PEOPLE
AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT
I KISS YOUR HANDS AND FACE MY SWEET MAY GOD WATCH OVER YOU AND PROTECT YOU FROM ALL HARM YOUR AFECKSIONATE PUPIL ANNETTA BELL THIS EXTRAORDINARY LETTER PUZZLED ME NOT A LITTLE
TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
MY AUNT MARY IS A VERY PARTICULAR WOMAN AND A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS THERE WE WERE AT TEA I KNOCKED OVER A JUG AND BROKE IT AUNT MARY SAID SHE HAD HAD THAT JUG EVER SINCE SHE WAS MARRIED AND NOBODY HAD EVER BROKEN IT BEFORE
THE MAIN QUESTION IS WILL THIS JOSHUA DO HIS WORK WELL IF HE DOES I DON'T SEE THAT IT MATTERS WHETHER HIS NAME IS PYE OR PUDDING HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING A GOOD WORKMAN THOUGH THEY SAY HE'S A VERY PECULIAR MAN HE HARDLY EVER TALKS
WHEN I WAS HELPING AUNT MARY WITH THE DINNER DISHES I DROPPED A CHINA PLATE AND IT SMASHED THAT EVENING I FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE AND HAD TO STAY IN BED FOR A WEEK I HEARD AUNT MARY TELL UNCLE JOSEPH IT WAS A MERCY OR I'D HAVE BROKEN EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
ELIZA BELL HAD SET FIRE TO HER AUNT'S CARDED ROLLS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO DO IT SHE SAID NOT ALTOGETHER
HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
AND HERS ARE GENERALLY AS BRIEF AS SAINT CLAIR'S ANNETTA IS A QUIET LITTLE PUSS AND A MODEL OF GOOD BEHAVIOR BUT THERE ISN'T A SHADOW OF ORGINALITY IN HER HERE IS HER LETTER DEAREST TEACHER I THINK I WILL WRITE YOU A LETTER TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU
JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
I'VE TRIED TO SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE BUT IT ALL CAME DIFFERENT ALICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE REPEAT YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN
IF THEY NONE OF THEM GO WELL THEN WE HOLD THE CABIN AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT IF SOME GO YOU MARK MY WORDS SIR SILVER'LL BRING EM ABOARD AGAIN AS MILD AS LAMBS IT WAS SO DECIDED
HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY I
THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
YET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK PRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT IN MY YOUTH SAID HIS FATHER I TOOK TO THE LAW AND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE AND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW HAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE
I'M NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB I'VE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM
THE SLIGHTEST ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITH A BLACK LOOK AND GRUDGINGLY AND CARELESSLY OBEYED EVEN THE HONEST HANDS MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN ABOARD TO MEND ANOTHER MUTINY IT WAS PLAIN
THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERE'S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE I'M NEVER SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT
THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
SILENCE HAD RE ESTABLISHED ITS EMPIRE AND ONLY THE RUSTLE OF THE REDESCENDING BIRDS AND THE BOOM OF THE DISTANT SURGES DISTURBED THE LANGUOR OF THE AFTERNOON TOM HAD LEAPED AT THE SOUND LIKE A HORSE AT THE SPUR
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO A CHRYSALIS YOU WILL SOME DAY YOU KNOW AND THEN AFTER THAT INTO A BUTTERFLY I SHOULD THINK YOU'LL FEEL IT A LITTLE QUEER WON'T YOU NOT A BIT SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT
THE THICKET STRETCHED DOWN FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE SANDY KNOLLS SPREADING AND GROWING TALLER AS IT WENT UNTIL IT REACHED THE MARGIN OF THE BROAD REEDY FEN THROUGH WHICH THE NEAREST OF THE LITTLE RIVERS SOAKED ITS WAY INTO THE ANCHORAGE
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION LIKE A SERPENT SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES
AND WITH STUNNING VIOLENCE RIGHT BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK HIS HANDS FLEW UP HE GAVE A SORT OF GASP AND FELL WHETHER HE WERE INJURED MUCH OR LITTLE NONE COULD EVER TELL
AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAID ALICE I'VE TRIED THE ROOTS OF TREES AND I'VE TRIED BANKS AND I'VE TRIED HEDGES THE PIGEON WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER BUT THOSE SERPENTS THERE'S NO PLEASING THEM
COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR
WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT I'M NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE I'M A I'M A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON
IF SIX MEN WERE LEFT BY SILVER IT WAS PLAIN OUR PARTY COULD NOT TAKE AND FIGHT THE SHIP AND SINCE ONLY SIX WERE LEFT IT WAS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THE CABIN PARTY HAD NO PRESENT NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE TO GO ASHORE
HAD HE BEEN ON DECK HE COULD NO LONGER SO MUCH AS HAVE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IT WAS AS PLAIN AS DAY
HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
HERE AND THERE I SAW SNAKES AND ONE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM A LEDGE OF ROCK AND HISSED AT ME WITH A NOISE NOT UNLIKE THE SPINNING OF A TOP LITTLE DID I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A DEADLY ENEMY AND THAT THE NOISE WAS THE FAMOUS RATTLE
I COULD HEAR HAILS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE OLD BUCCANEER AND HIS COMRADES AND THIS SOUND OF DANGER LENT ME WINGS AS SOON AS I WAS CLEAR OF THE THICKET I RAN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE SCARCE MINDING THE DIRECTION OF MY FLIGHT
AND THE SURF THAT WE COULD BOTH SEE AND HEAR FOAMING AND THUNDERING ON THE STEEP BEACH AT LEAST ALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND HOT AND THE SHORE BIRDS WERE FISHING AND CRYING ALL AROUND US
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY
LEAPING BACK A YARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME WITH THE SPEED AND SECURITY OF A TRAINED GYMNAST HANDS OFF IF YOU LIKE JOHN SILVER SAID THE OTHER IT'S A BLACK CONSCIENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEARED OF ME BUT IN HEAVEN'S NAME TELL ME WHAT WAS THAT
BUT SILVER FROM THE OTHER BOAT LOOKED SHARPLY OVER AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW IF THAT WERE ME AND FROM THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO REGRET WHAT I HAD DONE THE CREWS RACED FOR THE BEACH BUT THE BOAT I WAS IN HAVING SOME START AND BEING AT ONCE THE LIGHTER AND THE BETTER MANNED
GOOD BYE TO THE SQUIRE THE DOCTOR AND THE CAPTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT DEATH BY STARVATION OR DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS ALL THIS WHILE AS I SAY I WAS STILL RUNNING
THE BOOMS WERE TEARING AT THE BLOCKS THE RUDDER WAS BANGING TO AND FRO AND THE WHOLE SHIP CREAKING GROANING AND JUMPING LIKE A MANUFACTORY
HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
IN MY YOUTH SAID THE SAGE AS HE SHOOK HIS GREY LOCKS I KEPT ALL MY LIMBS VERY SUPPLE BY THE USE OF THIS OINTMENT ONE SHILLING THE BOX ALLOW ME TO SELL YOU A COUPLE YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH AND YOUR JAWS ARE TOO WEAK FOR ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN SUET
APPEARED THE WORST WE HELD A COUNCIL IN THE CABIN SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN IF I RISK ANOTHER ORDER THE WHOLE SHIP'LL COME ABOUT OUR EARS BY THE RUN YOU SEE SIR HERE IT IS I GET A ROUGH ANSWER DO I NOT
FOR I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING IT ISN'T SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT SO YET SAID ALICE
ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
JUST BEFORE HIM TOM LAY MOTIONLESS UPON THE SWARD BUT THE MURDERER MINDED HIM NOT A WHIT CLEANSING HIS BLOOD STAINED KNIFE THE WHILE UPON A WISP OF GRASS EVERYTHING ELSE WAS UNCHANGED
THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT COME MY HEAD'S FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT
LOADED PISTOLS WERE SERVED OUT TO ALL THE SURE MEN HUNTER JOYCE AND REDRUTH WERE TAKEN INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH LESS SURPRISE AND A BETTER SPIRIT THAN WE HAD LOOKED FOR AND THEN THE CAPTAIN WENT ON DECK AND ADDRESSED THE CREW
THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT
ALL'S UP YOU CAN'T MAKE NOR MEND IT'S TO SAVE YOUR NECK THAT I'M A SPEAKING AND IF ONE OF THE WILD UNS KNEW IT WHERE'D I BE TOM NOW TELL ME WHERE'D I BE SILVER SAID THE OTHER MAN
I MADE STEADILY BUT SLOWLY TOWARDS THEM TILL AT LAST RAISING MY HEAD TO AN APERTURE AMONG THE LEAVES I COULD SEE CLEAR DOWN INTO A LITTLE GREEN DELL BESIDE THE MARSH AND CLOSELY SET ABOUT WITH TREES WHERE LONG JOHN SILVER
AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
WAS A THING I NEVER LEARNED TO STAND WITHOUT A QUALM OR SO ABOVE ALL IN THE MORNING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH PERHAPS IT WAS THIS PERHAPS IT WAS THE LOOK OF THE ISLAND WITH ITS GREY MELANCHOLY WOODS AND WILD STONE SPIRES
HIS EYE A MERE PIN POINT IN HIS BIG FACE BUT GLEAMING LIKE A CRUMB OF GLASS THAT
FOR SOON I HEARD THE VERY DISTANT AND LOW TONES OF A HUMAN VOICE WHICH AS I CONTINUED TO GIVE EAR GREW STEADILY LOUDER AND NEARER THIS PUT ME IN A GREAT FEAR AND I CRAWLED UNDER COVER OF THE NEAREST LIVE OAK AND SQUATTED THERE
BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD LOST THE CHILDREN AND WHEN HE HAD RELATED THE STORY HOW HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE THEM TO THE WOOD THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A GOOD SCOLDING CALLING HIM A BLOCKHEAD FOR ALLOWING A WOMAN TO PUT HER HEEL UPON HIS NECK
AFTER A WHILE HE ARRIVED AT A WILD AND DREARY FOREST SO DARK THAT IT MADE YOU SHUDDER THERE UPON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE FOUND A FAIRY SURROUNDED BY A BAND OF ROBBERS CIENZO SEEING THE WICKED INTENTION OF THE ROBBERS
WHERE CORVETTO SPEEDILY STONED THEM TO DEATH THEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AND TOOK THE KEYS TO THE KING WHO SEEING THE VALOUR AND CLEVERNESS OF THE LAD IN SPITE OF ILL FORTUNE AND THE ENVY AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COURTIERS GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER TO WIFE
FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
AND RUN ABOUT LIKE DEER TO HIT THE KING'S PLEASURE TO A HAIR TRULY ONE MUST BE BORN TO GOOD FORTUNE IN THIS WORLD AND HE WHO HAS NOT LUCK MIGHT AS WELL BE THROWN INTO THE SEA WHAT IS TO BE DONE WE CAN ONLY LOOK ON AND ENVY
BREAK AND GLUE TOGETHER OF WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU ONE INSTANCE IN THE STORY THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF WIDE RIVER AN EXCELLENT YOUTH NAMED CORVETTO WHO FOR HIS GOOD CONDUCT
WHOM THE FATHER EMBRACED AND KISSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT BEING SATISFIED THEN THE PRINCE MADE HIM PULL OFF HIS JACKET AND HAD HIM DRESSED LIKE A LORD AND SENDING FOR JANNUCCIO'S WIFE HE SHOWED HER THOSE TWO GOLDEN PIPPINS
BUT CORVETTO WHO WAS ENCHANTED AND PERCEIVED THE TRAPS AND DISCOVERED THE TRICKS WAS AWARE OF ALL THE INTRIGUES AND THE AMBUSCADES THE PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES OF HIS ENEMIES HE KEPT HIS EARS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND HIS EYES OPEN
AND TO ENJOY THE COOL SEA BREEZES AND WHILST A GREAT BANQUET WAS PREPARING NENNILLO HAD STEPPED OUT UPON A BALCONY OF THE PALACE ON THE ROCK TO SHARPEN SOME KNIVES PRIDING HIMSELF GREATLY ON ACQUIRING HONOUR FROM HIS OFFICE
AND BEWAILING THE SAD FATE OF THE POOR GIRL THEN THE DRAGON CAME OUT OF THE CAVE BUT CIENZO LAID HOLD OF HIS SWORD AND STRUCK OFF A HEAD IN A TRICE BUT THE DRAGON WENT AND RUBBED HIS NECK ON A CERTAIN PLANT WHICH GREW NOT FAR OFF
HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH AMAZEMENT AND ORDERED A NUMBER OF SERVANTS TO TRY WHETHER BY ANY MEANS THEY COULD ENSNARE THE FISH AND DRAW IT TO LAND AT LAST HEARING THE WORDS BROTHER BROTHER CONTINUALLY REPEATED HE ASKED ALL HIS SERVANTS ONE BY ONE
WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
MANY A MAN CURSES THE RAIN THAT FALLS UPON HIS HEAD AND KNOWS NOT THAT IT BRINGS ABUNDANCE TO DRIVE AWAY HUNGER AS IS SEEN IN THE PERSON OF A YOUNG MAN OF WHOM I WILL TELL YOU IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MERCHANT NAMED ANTONIELLO
THAT IT CAN HOLD AN ARMY AND YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ALL THE COURTYARDS PORTICOES COLONNADES BALCONIES AND SPIRAL CHIMNEYS WHICH THERE ARE BUILT WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ARCHITECTURE THAT ART PRIDES HERSELF UPON THEM NATURE IS ABASHED
TAKE THIS TREASURE WHICH IS DESTINED FOR THEE ALONE BUT MIND AND TAKE CARE OF IT THEN THEY VANISHED AND CIENZO
IN ORDER NOT TO TAKE A FALSE STEP WELL KNOWING THAT THE FORTUNE OF COURTIERS IS AS GLASS BUT THE HIGHER THE LAD CONTINUED TO RISE THE LOWER THE OTHERS FELL TILL AT LAST BEING PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS FEET
AND SUDDENLY THE HEAD JOINED ITSELF ON AGAIN LIKE A LIZARD JOINING ITSELF TO ITS TAIL CIENZO SEEING THIS EXCLAIMED HE WHO DARES NOT WINS NOT AND SETTING HIS TEETH HE STRUCK SUCH A FURIOUS BLOW
UPON THE SEA SHOULD SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT OF THEM FOR HAVING EMBARKED IN A SMALL BOAT NO SOONER WAS HE UPON THE OPEN SEA THAN THERE CAME SUCH A STORM OF WIND AND TUMULT OF THE WAVES THAT THE BOAT WAS UPSET AND ALL WERE DROWNED ALL EXCEPT NENNELLA
IT WAS HE WHO BEGAN AND PROVOKED ME WE ARE BUT BOYS AND THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUARREL AFTER ALL TIS A FIRST FAULT AND THE KING IS A MAN OF REASON BUT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT GREAT HARM CAN HE DO ME THE WIDE WORLD IS ONE'S HOME
BUT WHAT A PITY YOU HAVE NOT THE OGRE'S TAPESTRY WHICH IS A THING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WORDS CAN TELL AND WOULD SPREAD YOUR FAME FAR AND WIDE THERE IS NO ONE HOWEVER ABLE TO PROCURE THIS TREASURE BUT CORVETTO WHO IS JUST THE LAD TO DO SUCH A KIND OF SERVICE
WILL GIVE YOU SHELTER FROM THE SUN WHERE THE RIVER MORE CHARITABLE WILL GIVE YOU DRINK WITHOUT POISON AND THE EARTH MORE KIND WILL GIVE YOU A PILLOW OF GRASS WITHOUT DANGER AND WHEN YOU WANT FOOD FOLLOW THIS LITTLE PATH OF BRAN WHICH I HAVE MADE FOR YOU IN A STRAIGHT LINE
THE POOR HUSBAND WHO HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR THIS WOMAN SAID TO HER SOFTLY WIFE DON'T BE ANGRY FOR SUGAR IS DEAR AND TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE THE COCK CROWS I WILL REMOVE THIS ANNOYANCE IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
THAT HE CUT OFF ALL SEVEN HEADS WHICH FLEW FROM THE NECKS LIKE PEAS FROM THE PAN WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT THE TONGUES AND PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET HE FLUNG THE HEADS A MILE APART FROM THE BODY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER COME TOGETHER AGAIN
THEREUPON THE OGRE SUDDENLY STARTING UP TOLD HIS WIFE NOT TO PULL SO FOR SHE WAS DRAGGING ALL THE CLOTHES OFF HIM AND WOULD GIVE HIM HIS DEATH OF COLD
WAS BELOVED BY HIS MASTER AND FOR THIS VERY CAUSE WAS DISLIKED AND HATED BY ALL THE COURTIERS THESE COURTIERS WERE FILLED WITH SPITE AND MALICE AND BURSTING WITH ENVY AT THE KINDNESS WHICH THE KING SHOWED TO CORVETTO
WHICH WAS A THING WORTHY OF A KING ADDED THAT HE OUGHT TO ENDEAVOUR BY ALL MEANS TO GET IT OUT OF THE OGRE'S CLAWS AND THAT CORVETTO WAS JUST THE LAD TO DO THIS AS HE WAS EXPERT AND CLEVER AT ESCAPING OUT OF THE FIRE
WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH PREPARING THE FEAST THEN CORVETTO ENTERING WITH A LOOK OF COMPASSION SAID GOOD DAY MY GOOD WOMAN
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
HOW COMES HE BY THIS LUCK THAT NOT A DAY PASSES THAT HE RECEIVES SOME NEW FAVOURS WHILST WE ARE FOR EVER GOING BACKWARD LIKE A ROPE MAKER AND GETTING FROM BAD TO WORSE THOUGH WE SLAVE LIKE DOGS TOIL LIKE FIELD LABOURERS
HE DUG A DEEP HOLE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE AND COVERING IT OVER WITH BUSHES AND EARTH HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND THE GATE AS SOON AS CORVETTO SAW THE OGRE COMING WITH HIS KINSFOLK HE SET UP A LOUD CRY IN THE COURTYARD STOP STOP
THEN CHOOSING A VERY RICH LORD AMONG HIS VASSALS HE GAVE HIM NENNELLA TO WIFE AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER GREAT LORD TO NENNILLO ALLOWING THEM ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON WITH THEIR FATHER SO THAT THEY WANTED FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD
WHO WAS STILL PAYING COMPLIMENTS TO THE COUNTRY CLOWN WHEN THE MAN SAW THE DOG WITH THE LETTER IN HIS MOUTH HE ORDERED IT TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM BUT THE DOG WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO ANY ONE AND BOUNDING UP TO MENECHELLA HE PLACED IT IN HER HAND
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
AND THE HATRED OF THEIR STEPMOTHER BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOLLECT THE NAME OF THEIR FATHER NOR OF THEIR HOME THE PRINCE CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE ISSUED COMMANDING THAT WHOEVER HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN NAMED NENNILLO AND NENNELLA IN A WOOD
CANST ASSURE THE KING OF THE TRUTH AND PREVENT HIS ALLOWING ANOTHER TO GAIN THIS REWARD WHILE I HAVE HAD ALL THE TOIL FOR IT WILL BE THE RIGHT EFFECT OF THY FAIR ROYAL GRACE AND THE MERITED RECOMPENSE OF THIS STRONG HERO'S FIST IN CONCLUSION
HERE I STAND AND LET A RASCALLY THIEF CHEAT ME OUT OF MY TRUMP CARD SO SAYING HE TOOK AN INKSTAND SEIZED A PEN AND SPREADING OUT A SHEET OF PAPER BEGAN TO WRITE TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWEL OF WOMEN MENECHELLA
TO KEEP THEM HERE TO PLAGUE MY VERY LIFE OUT GO TAKE THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT I'LL NOT WAIT FOR THE CROWING OF COCKS AND THE CACKLING OF HENS OR ELSE BE ASSURED THAT TO MORROW MORNING I'LL GO OFF TO MY PARENTS HOUSE FOR YOU DO NOT DESERVE ME
THERE WAS ONCE A GOOD MAN NAMED JANNUCCIO WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA WHOM HE LOVED AS MUCH AS HIS OWN LIFE BUT DEATH HAVING WITH THE SMOOTH FILE OF TIME
HE CAME AT LAST TO THE PALACE OF A KING WHICH WAS ALL HUNG WITH MOURNING SO THAT IT MADE ONE'S HEART BLACK TO LOOK AT IT WHEN CIENZO INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THE MOURNING THE FOLKS ANSWERED A DRAGON WITH SEVEN HEADS HAS MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
AND NOW THE LOT HAS FALLEN ON MENECHELLA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING SO THERE IS GREAT WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE ROYAL PALACE SINCE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN ALL THE LAND IS DOOMED TO BE DEVOURED BY THIS HORRID BEAST
TILL THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY WITH THE NOISE BUT CORVETTO AFTER THROWING THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE WINDOW LET HIMSELF DROP DOWN UPON THEM THEN MAKING UP A GOOD BUNDLE HE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO THE CITY
AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
SHOULD COME TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND HE WOULD THERE RECEIVE JOYFUL NEWS OF THEM JANNUCCIO WHO HAD ALL THIS TIME PASSED A SAD AND DISCONSOLATE LIFE BELIEVING THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES
AND THEIR CAPTAIN TOOK HER HOME WITH HIM WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVING JUST LOST A LITTLE GIRL TOOK HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER MEANTIME NENNILLO WHO HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE DOGS
SEIZED HIS SWORD AND SOON MADE A SLAUGHTER OF THEM THE FAIRY SHOWERED THANKS UPON HIM FOR THIS BRAVE DEED DONE FOR HER SAKE AND INVITED HIM TO HER PALACE THAT SHE MIGHT REWARD HIM BUT CIENZO REPLIED IT IS NOTHING AT ALL THANK YOU KINDLY
SO IT SHALL BE DONE SAID THE PRINCE THE GOAT HAS BUTTED AT HERSELF QUICK NOW YOU HAVE PASSED THE SENTENCE AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT FOR HAVING BORNE THESE BEAUTIFUL STEPCHILDREN SUCH MALICE SO HE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE INSTANTLY EXECUTED
PROMISING TO SCORE IT UP WITH THE CHALK OF GRATITUDE AT THE TAVERN OF MEMORY SO CORVETTO INSTANTLY SET OUT HEELS OVER HEAD AND ARRIVING AT THE OGRE'S PALACE HE FOUND THAT THE OGRESS WHILST HER HUSBAND WAS GONE TO INVITE THE KINSFOLK
AND GOING DOWN HE SAW A LIGHTED LAMP AND THREE GHOST LOOKING FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING A PITEOUS CLAMOUR CRYING ALAS MY BEAUTEOUS TREASURE I MUST LOSE THEE WHEN CIENZO SAW THIS
AND IN FOUR SECONDS WAS ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE OGRE LIVED THEN PASSING UNSEEN INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH HE SLEPT HE HID HIMSELF UNDER THE BED AND WAITED AS STILL AS A MOUSE UNTIL NIGHT TO MAKE THE STARS LAUGH
TO HAVE ALL THIS TROUBLE AND BE FOR EVER TEASED BY A COUPLE OF SQUALLING BRATS WOULD THAT I HAD BROKEN MY NECK ERE I EVER CAME TO THIS PLACE TO HAVE BAD FOOD WORSE DRINK AND GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
HAVING BY THE FAVOUR OF SOL IN LEO SAVED THY LIFE I HEAR THAT ANOTHER PLUMES HIMSELF WITH MY LABOURS THAT ANOTHER CLAIMS THE REWARD OF THE SERVICE WHICH I RENDERED THOU THEREFORE WHO WAST PRESENT AT THE DRAGON'S DEATH
WISHED TO CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND THE LADDER WHEREAT HE SET UP SUCH A CRY
SO THAT ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY CORNER OF THE PALACE THEY DID NOTHING BUT TATTLE AND WHISPER MURMUR AND GRUMBLE AT THE POOR LAD SAYING WHAT SORCERY HAS THIS FELLOW PRACTISED ON THE KING THAT HE TAKES SUCH A FANCY TO HIM
THEN GOING VERY QUIETLY TO THE OGRE'S STABLE HE SADDLED AND MOUNTED THE HORSE AND FIXING HIS FEET FIRMLY IN THE STIRRUP TOOK HIS WAY BACK BUT AS SOON AS THE HORSE SAW HIMSELF SPURRED OUT OF THE PALACE HE CRIED ALOUD HOLLO
WHERE IS THE COUNTERPANE REPLIED THE OGRE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO THE FLOOR HE TOUCHED CORVETTO'S FACE WHEREUPON HE SET UP A LOUD CRY THE IMP THE IMP HOLLO HERE LIGHTS RUN QUICKLY
THE MOST TERRIBLE MONSTER THAT EVER WAS SEEN WITH THE CREST OF A COCK THE HEAD OF A CAT EYES OF FIRE THE MOUTH OF A BULLDOG THE WINGS OF A BAT THE CLAWS OF A BEAR AND THE TAIL OF A SERPENT NOW THIS DRAGON SWALLOWS A MAIDEN EVERY DAY
WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED EVEN A HERO SO THEY WENT SLOWLY ALONG THE PATH OF ASHES AND IT WAS ALREADY MIDNIGHT ERE THEY REACHED THEIR HOME WHEN PASCOZZA THEIR STEPMOTHER SAW THE CHILDREN SHE ACTED NOT LIKE A WOMAN BUT A PERFECT FURY
ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
I'VE CAUGHT HIM AND
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT YOU SO MANY FINE THINGS ONLY TO BE MADE THE SLAVE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT MY OWN POOR JANNUCCIO WHO SAW THAT MATTERS WERE GROWING RATHER TOO WARM IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE LITTLE ONES AND RETURNED TO THE WOOD
THEN THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO GO NEARER TO THE FISH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR PERHAPS THIS ADVENTURE MIGHT CONCERN HIM AS SOON AS NENNILLO APPROACHED THE FISH IT RAISED UP ITS HEAD UPON THE ROCK AND OPENING ITS THROAT SIX PALMS WIDE
WHO HAD A SON CALLED CIENZO IT HAPPENED THAT CIENZO WAS ONE DAY THROWING STONES ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES AND BY CHANCE BROKE HIS COMPANION'S HEAD WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER
THAT WHOSOEVER HAD KILLED THE DRAGON SHOULD COME AND MARRY THE PRINCESS NOW A RASCAL OF A COUNTRY FELLOW HEARING THIS PROCLAMATION TOOK THE HEADS OF THE DRAGON AND SAID MENECHELLA HAS BEEN SAVED BY ME THESE HANDS HAVE FREED THE LAND FROM DESTRUCTION
AND A LITTLE MORE SILENCE MISTER LAMMLE BREAKS THE LATTER YOU SHALL PROCEED IN YOUR OWN WAY
HE IS AT HER SIDE AGAIN IN A PACE OR TWO AND HE RETORTS THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID DISINGENUOUSNESS WHAT IF I DID THERE IS NO IF IN THE CASE YOU DID I DID THEN AND WHAT OF IT
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS WITH IT WHEREUPON SHE CALLS HIM IN HER RAGE A DELIBERATE VILLAIN AND SO CASTS THE BROKEN THING FROM HER AS THAT IT STRIKES HIM IN FALLING THE FINGER MARKS ARE SOMETHING WHITER FOR THE INSTANT BUT HE WALKS ON AT HER SIDE
WITH A HEAVY SHOE WHICH A BUFFER IN THE HALL CHAMPAGNE FLUSHED AND WILD OF AIM HAS BORROWED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S PORTER TO CAST AFTER THE DEPARTING PAIR AS AN AUSPICIOUS OMEN SO THEY ALL GO UP AGAIN INTO THE GORGEOUS DRAWING ROOMS
MISTER LAMMLE TAKES HIS GINGEROUS WHISKERS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER FROWNS FURTIVELY AT HIS BELOVED OUT OF A THICK GINGEROUS BUSH DO I MEAN TO SAY
PUTTING IT ON ME THE UNMANLY DISINGENUOUSNESS MISTER LAMMLE STOPS RELEASES HIS WHISKERS AND LOOKS AT HER THE WHAT MISSUS LAMMLE HAUGHTILY REPLIES WITHOUT STOPPING AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THE MEANNESS
NOT HOWEVER THAT HE HAS THE LEAST NOTION OF ITS BEING HIS OWN CASE OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA PURSUES VENEERING THE VEILED PROPHET OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA
WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
THE MALIGNANT STAR OF THE ANALYTICAL HAS PRE ORDAINED THAT PAIN AND RIDICULE SHALL BEFALL HIM FOR HE STANDING ON THE DOORSTEPS TO GRACE THE DEPARTURE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT
WE AGREE TO KEEP OUR OWN SECRET AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR OWN SCHEMES WHAT SCHEMES ANY SCHEME THAT WILL BRING US MONEY BY OUR OWN SCHEMES I MEAN OUR JOINT INTEREST AGREED
WHICH MAKES SEVEN TWEMLOW THOUGHT AND CONFIDENTIALLY RETIRING WITH HIM INTO THE CONSERVATORY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT VENEERING IS HIS CO TRUSTEE AND THAT THEY ARE ARRANGING ABOUT THE FORTUNE BUFFERS ARE EVEN OVERHEARD TO WHISPER
VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
AND A LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CUT IN AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MORROW AND HE IS LOW AND FEELS IT DULL OVER THE LIVERY STABLE YARD AND IS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF A DINT IN HIS HEART MADE BY THE MOST ADORABLE OF THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAIDS
BECAUSE IT IS IDENTICAL WITH THE PAST KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE OF YOU AND IN TWITTING ME YOU TWIT YOURSELF AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU DO IT WITH THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN US IT IS BETTER NEVER DONE TO WIND UP ALL YOU HAVE SHOWN TEMPER TODAY SOPHRONIA
AND AN UNACKNOWLEDGED MEMBER OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY WHOM LADY TIPPINS SURVEYING THROUGH HER EYE GLASS CONSIDERS A FINE MAN AND QUITE A CATCH
BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH UPON MYSELF WHEN I HAVE RESPECTED FAMILY FRIENDS TO REMEMBER SECONDLY

CRYING ON A BLOCK OF STONE AND IS IN ALL THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HUMOURS OF HER SEX AT ONCE PENDING HER CHANGES THOSE AFORESAID MARKS IN HIS FACE HAVE COME AND GONE NOW HERE NOW THERE LIKE WHITE STEPS OF A PIPE ON WHICH THE DIABOLICAL PERFORMER HAS PLAYED A TUNE
SHE HAS A REPUTATION FOR GIVING SMART ACCOUNTS OF THINGS AND SHE MUST BE AT THESE PEOPLE'S EARLY MY DEAR TO LOSE NOTHING OF THE FUN WHEREABOUT IN THE BONNET AND DRAPERY ANNOUNCED BY HER NAME ANY FRAGMENT OF THE REAL WOMAN MAY BE CONCEALED
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES WANDERING THEN THERE ARE THREE OF US AND SHE'S THE OTHER MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD RESUMES VENEERING WHOM YOU BOTH KNOW IS OUT OF TOWN BUT HE WRITES IN HIS WHIMSICAL MANNER
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES ON PODSNAP THEN THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US AND HE'S THE OTHER I DID HOPE VENEERING GOES ON TO HAVE HAD LADY TIPPINS TO MEET YOU
THIRTY SHILLINGS A YARD VEIL FIFTEEN POUND POCKET HANDKERCHIEF A PRESENT BRIDESMAIDS

ESQUIRE OF STUCCONIA AND WAS GIVEN AWAY BY MELVIN TWEMLOW ESQUIRE OF DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S SECOND COUSIN TO LORD SNIGSWORTH OF SNIGSWORTHY PARK WHILE PERUSING WHICH COMPOSITION TWEMLOW MAKES SOME OPAQUE APPROACH TO PERCEIVING
WE COME SMOOTHLY TO THIRDLY YOU HAVE CALLED ME AN ADVENTURER SOPHRONIA SO I AM IN PLAIN UNCOMPLIMENTARY ENGLISH SO I AM SO ARE YOU MY DEAR SO ARE MANY PEOPLE
IS NOW AMONG US THAT FRIEND IS TWEMLOW CERTAINLY FROM PODSNAP THAT FRIEND VENEERING REPEATS WITH GREATER FIRMNESS IS OUR DEAR GOOD TWEMLOW
A WASTE A WASTE A WASTE MY TWEMLOW
AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE MISSUS LAMMLE RESUMES STERNLY WHEN YOU TALK OF MY MARRYING YOU FOR WORLDLY ADVANTAGES THAT IT WAS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REASONABLE PROBABILITY
SO WE AGREE TO KEEP THE FACT TO OURSELVES YOU AGREE IF IT IS POSSIBLE I DO POSSIBLE
I SUPPOSE SO AGREED CARRIED AT ONCE YOU SEE NOW SOPHRONIA ONLY HALF A DOZEN WORDS MORE WE KNOW ONE ANOTHER PERFECTLY DON'T BE TEMPTED INTO TWITTING ME WITH THE PAST KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE OF ME
AND WHEN I LOOK BACK THE BRIDE CRIES INTERRUPTING AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU WONDER HOW YOU CAN HAVE BEEN YOU'LL EXCUSE THE WORD MOST CERTAINLY WITH SO MUCH REASON SUCH A FOOL AS TO TAKE ME
GAVE AWAY ANYBODY ELSE FIRST HE WOULD NEVER GIVE AWAY BABY THUS MISSUS VENEERING WITH HER OPEN HANDS PRESSED TOGETHER AND EACH OF HER EIGHT AQUILINE FINGERS LOOKING SO VERY LIKE HER ONE AQUILINE NOSE THAT THE BRAN NEW JEWELS ON THEM SEEM NECESSARY FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE
ALL OF THEM FLUSHED WITH BREAKFAST AS HAVING TAKEN SCARLATINA SOCIABLY
TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT UPON TRUST BUT THE FOLLY IS COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES I CANNOT GET RID OF YOU YOU CANNOT GET RID OF ME WHAT FOLLOWS SHAME AND MISERY THE BRIDE BITTERLY REPLIES I DON'T KNOW A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING FOLLOWS
ANNOUNCES BREAKFAST DINING ROOM NO LESS MAGNIFICENT THAN DRAWING ROOM TABLES SUPERB ALL THE CAMELS OUT AND ALL LADEN SPLENDID CAKE COVERED WITH CUPIDS SILVER AND TRUE LOVERS KNOTS
NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES IF YOU WERE SO DULL A FORTUNE HUNTER THAT YOU DECEIVED YOURSELF OR IF YOU WERE SO GREEDY AND GRASPING THAT YOU WERE OVER WILLING TO BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES IS IT MY FAULT YOU ADVENTURER THE LADY DEMANDS WITH GREAT ASPERITY
ON THE SANDS AT SHANKLIN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE HAVE WALKED FOR SOME TIME ON THE SHANKLIN SANDS AND ONE MAY SEE BY THEIR FOOTPRINTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED ARM IN ARM AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT TRACK
THERE WAS A GOLDEN SURFACE ON THE BROWN CLIFFS BUT NOW AND BEHOLD THEY ARE ONLY DAMP EARTH A TAUNTING ROAR COMES FROM THE SEA AND THE FAR OUT ROLLERS MOUNT UPON ONE ANOTHER TO LOOK AT THE ENTRAPPED IMPOSTORS AND TO JOIN IN IMPISH AND EXULTANT GAMBOLS
RETURNS MORTIMER EUGENE IS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WITH A PERVADING AIR UPON HIM OF HAVING PRESUPPOSED THE CEREMONY TO BE A FUNERAL AND OF BEING DISAPPOINTED
IS PERHAPS KNOWN TO HER MAID BUT YOU COULD EASILY BUY ALL YOU SEE OF HER IN BOND STREET OR YOU MIGHT SCALP HER AND PEEL HER AND SCRAPE HER AND MAKE TWO LADY TIPPINSES OUT OF HER AND YET NOT PENETRATE TO THE GENUINE ARTICLE
AND EVEN THE UNKNOWNS ARE SLOWLY STRAINED OFF AND IT IS ALL OVER ALL OVER THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER TIME TO COME AND IT COMES IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AND IT COMES TO MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE
EMITTING FLASHES OF MANY COLOURED LIGHTNING FROM DIAMONDS EMERALDS AND RUBIES THE ANALYTICAL IN COURSE OF TIME ACHIEVING WHAT HE FEELS TO BE DUE TO HIMSELF IN BRINGING TO A DIGNIFIED CONCLUSION SEVERAL QUARRELS HE HAS ON HAND WITH THE PASTRYCOOK'S MEN
IF YOU HAD WAITED A MOMENT YOU TOO ARE DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AN INJURED FIGURE YOU ARE NOW COOL ENOUGH SOPHRONIA TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T BE INJURED WITHOUT MY BEING EQUALLY INJURED AND THAT THEREFORE THE MERE WORD IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES SO BE IT NEXT COMES WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
OF BABY'S GODFATHER AND INDEED VENEERING IS MUCH RELIEVED IN MIND TO FIND THAT PODSNAP BETRAYS NO JEALOUSY OF TWEMLOW'S ELEVATION SO IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT THE SPRING VAN IS STREWING FLOWERS ON THE ROSY HOURS AND ON THE STAIRCASE
NEITHER WILL I RETURNS THE BRIDEGROOM WITH THAT THEY WALK AGAIN SHE MAKING THOSE ANGRY SPIRTS IN THE SAND HE DRAGGING THAT DEJECTED TAIL
BETIMES NEXT MORNING THAT HORRIBLE OLD LADY TIPPINS
YIELDING TO HIS HAND SHE RISES AND THEY WALK AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE MISSUS LAMMLE WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVING AND WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVED
WHILE THE LOVES AND GRACES HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS TORCH FOR HYMEN WHICH IS TO BE KINDLED TO MORROW MISTER TWEMLOW HAS SUFFERED MUCH IN HIS MIND
AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE MISSUS LAMMLE IS THROWN ON THE FEMININE RESOURCE OF SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU UTTERED OR DID NOT UTTER
AND WHOSE LEFT HAND APPEARS TO BE IN A STATE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM BUT IS IN FACT VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED UP TO ACT AS A MONEY BOX AND NOW VENEERING SHOOTS OUT OF THE STUDY WHEREIN HE IS ACCUSTOMED WHEN CONTEMPLATIVE
POKEY UNKNOWNS AMAZED TO FIND HOW INTIMATELY THEY KNOW VENEERING PLUCK UP SPIRIT FOLD THEIR ARMS AND BEGIN TO CONTRADICT HIM BEFORE BREAKFAST WHAT TIME MISSUS VENEERING CARRYING BABY DRESSED AS A BRIDESMAID FLITS ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY
AND HE SAYS HE DOES KNOW HIM AND PODSNAP RECIPROCATES APPARENTLY PODSNAP HAS BEEN SO WROUGHT UPON IN A SHORT TIME AS TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE MANY MANY MANY YEARS
THAT THE LATTER IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE WOULD LIKE TO DO PARTICULARLY TO THE PRESENT COMPANY IN WHICH STATE OF AFFAIRS THE USUAL CEREMONIES RATHER DROOP AND FLAG AND THE SPLENDID CAKE WHEN CUT BY THE FAIR HAND OF THE BRIDE
THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TALK AND LAUGH APART AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR MANNER AND THE BUFFERS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DISHES WITH SYSTEMATIC PERSEVERANCE
COMMANDS THE ASSENT OF THE MIND WHERE IT PRODUCES NOT THIS EFFECT IT MUST PROCEED EITHER FROM SOME DEFECT OR DISORDER IN THE ORGANS OF PERCEPTION OR FROM THE INFLUENCE OF SOME STRONG INTEREST OR PASSION OR PREJUDICE
INGENIOUS MEN MAY DECLAIM WITH PLAUSIBILITY ON ANY SUBJECT BUT NO HUMAN INGENUITY CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER EXPEDIENT TO RESCUE US FROM THE INCONVENIENCES AND EMBARRASSMENTS NATURALLY RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE SUPPLIES OF THE PUBLIC TREASURY
BY AN ACT WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT NO RELIANCE COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEADINESS OF ITS MEASURES FOR PAYING THE LOANS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE WOULD BE AS LIMITED IN THEIR EXTENT AS BURDENSOME IN THEIR CONDITIONS
A GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF EVERY POWER REQUISITE TO THE FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE OBJECTS COMMITTED TO ITS CARE AND TO THE COMPLETE EXECUTION OF THE TRUSTS FOR WHICH IT IS RESPONSIBLE FREE FROM EVERY OTHER CONTROL
THE MORE INTELLIGENT ADVERSARIES OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ADMIT THE FORCE OF THIS REASONING BUT THEY QUALIFY THEIR ADMISSION BY A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT THEY CALL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TAXATION THE FORMER
UNABLE BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO LAY HOLD OF FRESH RESOURCES AND URGED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL DANGER WOULD IT NOT BE DRIVEN TO THE EXPEDIENT OF DIVERTING THE FUNDS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FROM THEIR PROPER OBJECTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE STATE
IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE HOW A STEP OF THIS KIND COULD BE AVOIDED AND IF IT SHOULD BE TAKEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WOULD PROVE THE DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC CREDIT AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT IT WAS BECOMING ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY
FOR ALL THOSE MATTERS WHICH WILL CALL FOR DISBURSEMENTS OUT OF THE NATIONAL TREASURY THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE MUST BE INTERWOVEN IN THE FRAME OF THE GOVERNMENT A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER MONEY IS WITH PROPRIETY
HOW CAN IT EVER POSSESS EITHER ENERGY OR STABILITY DIGNITY OR CREDIT CONFIDENCE AT HOME OR RESPECTABILITY ABROAD HOW CAN ITS ADMINISTRATION BE ANY THING ELSE THAN A SUCCESSION OF EXPEDIENTS TEMPORIZING
ITS FUTURE NECESSITIES ADMIT NOT OF CALCULATION OR LIMITATION AND UPON THE PRINCIPLE MORE THAN ONCE ADVERTED TO THE POWER OF MAKING PROVISION FOR THEM AS THEY ARISE OUGHT TO BE EQUALLY UNCONFINED
WHATEVER MAY BE THE LIMITS OR MODIFICATIONS OF THE POWERS OF THE UNION IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE AN ENDLESS TRAIN OF POSSIBLE DANGERS AND BY INDULGING AN EXCESS OF JEALOUSY AND TIMIDITY
THE POWER OF CREATING NEW FUNDS UPON NEW OBJECTS OF TAXATION BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY WOULD ENABLE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO BORROW AS FAR AS ITS NECESSITIES MIGHT REQUIRE FOREIGNERS AS WELL AS THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA
UNASSISTED BY ANY ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS OR ILLUSTRATIONS BUT WE FIND IN FACT THAT THE ANTAGONISTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN THEIR JUSTNESS OR TRUTH
BUT THOUGH THIS BE STRICTLY AND TRULY THE CASE THOUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF SUCH A RIGHT WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF UNION THOUGH IT MAY SELDOM OR NEVER HAVE BEEN AVOWEDLY CLAIMED YET IN PRACTICE
YET THEY HAVE MUCH BETTER CLAIMS IN THIS RESPECT THAN TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF MEN IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS WE SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO ALLOW THEM THE OBSCURITY IS MUCH OFTENER IN THE PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES OF THE REASONER THAN IN THE SUBJECT
IN THE OTTOMAN OR TURKISH EMPIRE THE SOVEREIGN THOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS ABSOLUTE MASTER OF THE LIVES AND FORTUNES OF HIS SUBJECTS HAS NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE A NEW TAX THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE PERMITS THE BASHAWS OR GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES
SUCH MEN MUST BEHOLD THE ACTUAL SITUATION OF THEIR COUNTRY WITH PAINFUL SOLICITUDE AND DEPRECATE THE EVILS WHICH AMBITION OR REVENGE MIGHT
CONSIDERED AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY POLITIC AS THAT WHICH SUSTAINS ITS LIFE AND MOTION AND ENABLES IT TO PERFORM ITS MOST ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS A COMPLETE POWER THEREFORE TO PROCURE A REGULAR AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF IT
THE EXPENSE OF RAISING TROOPS OF BUILDING AND EQUIPPING FLEETS AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES IN ANY WISE CONNECTED WITH MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS AND OPERATIONS BUT THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY OBJECTS TO WHICH THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNION IN RESPECT TO REVENUE
IN WHAT DOES OUR SECURITY CONSIST AGAINST USURPATION FROM THAT QUARTER DOUBTLESS IN THE MANNER OF THEIR FORMATION AND IN A DUE DEPENDENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE TO ADMINISTER THEM UPON THE PEOPLE
MUST DEPEND ON THE MEANS WHICH THE CONTENDING PARTIES COULD EMPLOY TOWARD INSURING SUCCESS AS IN REPUBLICS STRENGTH IS ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE AND AS THERE ARE WEIGHTY REASONS TO INDUCE A BELIEF THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL COMMONLY POSSESS MOST INFLUENCE OVER THEM
THEY WOULD BE MADE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT USURERS COMMONLY LEND TO BANKRUPT AND FRAUDULENT DEBTORS WITH A SPARING HAND AND AT ENORMOUS PREMIUMS IT MAY PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT FROM THE SCANTINESS OF THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
ITS INEVITABLE TENDENCY WHENEVER IT IS BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY MUST BE TO ENFEEBLE THE UNION AND SOW THE SEEDS OF DISCORD AND CONTENTION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL HEAD AND ITS MEMBERS AND BETWEEN THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES
THE NATURAL CONCLUSION IS THAT SUCH CONTESTS WILL BE MOST APT TO END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE UNION AND THAT THERE IS GREATER PROBABILITY OF ENCROACHMENTS BY THE MEMBERS UPON THE FEDERAL HEAD THAN BY THE FEDERAL HEAD UPON THE MEMBERS
BUT PROCEEDING UPON AN ERRONEOUS PRINCIPLE IT HAS BEEN DONE IN SUCH A MANNER AS ENTIRELY TO HAVE FRUSTRATED THE INTENTION CONGRESS BY THE ARTICLES WHICH COMPOSE THAT COMPACT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED
TO IMAGINE THAT AT SUCH A CRISIS CREDIT MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF INFATUATION IN THE MODERN SYSTEM OF WAR NATIONS THE MOST WEALTHY ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LARGE LOANS
THAT IT CAN BE ADMITTED TO HAVE ANY PRETENSIONS TO FAIRNESS THE MOMENT WE LAUNCH INTO CONJECTURES ABOUT THE USURPATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE GET INTO AN UNFATHOMABLE ABYSS AND FAIRLY PUT OURSELVES OUT OF THE REACH OF ALL REASONING
AS REVENUE IS THE ESSENTIAL ENGINE BY WHICH THE MEANS OF ANSWERING THE NATIONAL EXIGENCIES MUST BE PROCURED THE POWER OF PROCURING THAT ARTICLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPREHENDED IN THAT OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE EXIGENCIES
TO PILLAGE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY AND IN TURN SQUEEZES OUT OF THEM THE SUMS OF WHICH HE STANDS IN NEED TO SATISFY HIS OWN EXIGENCIES AND THOSE OF THE STATE IN AMERICA FROM A LIKE CAUSE
A COUNTRY SO LITTLE OPULENT AS OURS MUST FEEL THIS NECESSITY IN A MUCH STRONGER DEGREE BUT WHO WOULD LEND TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PREFACED ITS OVERTURES FOR BORROWING
AS FAR AS THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT MAY BE REGARDED AS AN INDISPENSABLE INGREDIENT IN EVERY CONSTITUTION FROM A DEFICIENCY IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE OF TWO EVILS MUST ENSUE
IS A POINT AGREED AMONG GEOMETRICIANS THOUGH NOT LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO COMMON SENSE THAN ANY OF THOSE MYSTERIES IN RELIGION AGAINST WHICH THE BATTERIES OF INFIDELITY HAVE BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY LEVELED BUT IN THE SCIENCES OF MORALS AND POLITICS
ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THE NATURAL CONCEPTIONS WHICH THE MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE LED TO ENTERTAIN UPON THE SUBJECT THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER OR IN OTHER WORDS THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF A FINITE THING
THOUGH THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ELSEWHERE FULLY STATED THEY WILL PERHAPS NOT BE IMPROPERLY RECAPITULATED IN THIS PLACE AS INTRODUCTORY TO AN EXAMINATION OF WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY WAY OF OBJECTION TO THEM THEY ARE IN SUBSTANCE AS FOLLOWS
DID NOT EXPERIENCE EVINCE THE CONTRARY IT WOULD BE NATURAL TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PROPRIETY OF A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT SAFELY BE PERMITTED TO REST ON THE EVIDENCE OF THESE PROPOSITIONS
IMAGINATION MAY RANGE AT PLEASURE TILL IT GETS BEWILDERED AMIDST THE LABYRINTHS OF AN ENCHANTED CASTLE AND KNOWS NOT ON WHICH SIDE TO TURN TO EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM THE PERPLEXITIES INTO WHICH IT HAS SO RASHLY ADVENTURED
THAT WE ARE SURE THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IN THEIR FULL EXTENT WILL BE BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UNION THE OTHER IS THAT WHATEVER DEFICIENCES THERE MAY BE CAN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE SUPPLIED BY LOANS
THIS DISTINCTION HOWEVER WOULD VIOLATE THE MAXIM OF GOOD SENSE AND SOUND POLICY WHICH DICTATES THAT EVERY POWER OUGHT TO BE IN PROPORTION TO ITS OBJECT AND WOULD STILL LEAVE THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT IN A KIND OF TUTELAGE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
COULD THEN REASONABLY REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN ITS ENGAGEMENTS BUT TO DEPEND UPON A GOVERNMENT THAT MUST ITSELF DEPEND UPON THIRTEEN OTHER GOVERNMENTS FOR THE MEANS OF FULFILLING ITS CONTRACTS WHEN ONCE ITS SITUATION IS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
TO PROVIDE THE REVENUES WHICH THE NECESSITIES OF THE PUBLIC MIGHT REQUIRE THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FEEBLE AS IT IS INTENDED TO REPOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AN UNLIMITED POWER OF PROVIDING FOR THE PECUNIARY WANTS OF THE UNION
AND MAY DEGENERATE INTO OBSTINACY PERVERSENESS OR DISINGENUITY THOUGH IT CANNOT BE PRETENDED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF MORAL AND POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE IN GENERAL THE SAME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WITH THOSE OF THE MATHEMATICS
THE HALCYON SCENES OF THE POETIC OR FABULOUS AGE BUT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A COMMON PORTION OF THE VICISSITUDES AND CALAMITIES WHICH HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF OTHER NATIONS THEY MUST APPEAR ENTITLED TO SERIOUS ATTENTION
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A GOVERNMENT HALF SUPPLIED AND ALWAYS NECESSITOUS CAN FULFILL THE PURPOSES OF ITS INSTITUTION CAN PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY ADVANCE THE PROSPERITY OR SUPPORT THE REPUTATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
THOSE WHO HAVE CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO ITS VICES AND DEFORMITIES AS THEY HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED BY EXPERIENCE OR DELINEATED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS MUST FEEL INVINCIBLE REPUGNANCY TO TRUSTING THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IN ANY DEGREE TO ITS OPERATION
TAKING INTO THE ACCOUNT THE EXISTING DEBT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC UPON ANY PLAN OF EXTINGUISHMENT WHICH A MAN MODERATELY IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE AND PUBLIC CREDIT COULD APPROVE
OUGHT TO BE REFERRED TO THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF ITS POWERS THE STATE GOVERNMENTS BY THEIR ORIGINAL CONSTITUTIONS ARE INVESTED WITH COMPLETE SOVEREIGNTY
WE MAY BRING OURSELVES TO A STATE OF ABSOLUTE SCEPTICISM AND IRRESOLUTION I REPEAT HERE WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED IN SUBSTANCE IN ANOTHER PLACE THAT ALL OBSERVATIONS FOUNDED UPON THE DANGER OF USURPATION
COME SAID DANGLARS WILL YOU TAKE A MILLION NO TWO MILLIONS THREE FOUR COME FOUR I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU ON CONDITION THAT YOU LET ME GO
AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET LEFT TO HIMSELF THE FULL HORROR OF HIS COMING DEATH RUSHED UPON THE YOUNG MAN AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD THROWN AWAY HIS SOLE CHANCE OF LIFE WELL IF HE MUST HE MUST HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHEN THIS MAN IS SATISFIED LET HIM BE FREE DANGLARS REMAINED PROSTRATE WHILE THE COUNT WITHDREW WHEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD HE SAW DISAPPEARING DOWN THE PASSAGE NOTHING BUT A SHADOW BEFORE WHICH THE BANDITS BOWED
BUT NOWHERE COULD THEY FIND IT AND THE FARMER WHO HAD COME TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER WAS GREATLY GRIEVED AS HE FEARED IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD STOLEN IT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT THE HOODIE FOR A SON IN LAW
BUT BY THE TIME SHE HAD GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL HE WOULD BE IN THE VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN NIGHT CAME AND SHE WAS TIRED SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOME PLACE TO REST AND GLAD SHE WAS TO SEE A LITTLE HOUSE FULL OF LIGHT STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
AND A HANDSOMER MAN OR A MORE BEAUTIFUL HOODIE NEVER WAS SEEN THE GIRL LOVED THEM BOTH AND NEVER WISHED FOR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT BY AND BYE THEY HAD A SON AND VERY PLEASED THEY BOTH WERE
HE OFFERED HIM ONE THOUSAND FRANCS FOR A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD BUT PEPPINO DID NOT ANSWER ON THE FIFTH DAY HE DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE DOOR OF THE CELL ARE YOU NOT A CHRISTIAN HE SAID FALLING ON HIS KNEES
WHEN THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING AND THE JUDGES THE HALL WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING WHEN THE PRISONER ENTERED IT AND ALL MARVELLED AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS FACE THE KING INQUIRED IF HE HAD ANY EXCUSE TO PLEAD FOR THE HIGH TREASON HE HAD COMMITTED
WHY DO YOU OFFER ME FOUR MILLION FOR WHAT IS WORTH FIVE MILLION THIS IS A KIND OF USURY BANKER THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND TAKE ALL THEN TAKE ALL I TELL YOU AND KILL ME
AND THE HOODIE'S WIFE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HER HUSBAND RESOLVED TO TAKE HER AWAY TO ANOTHER HOUSE HE HAD AND HER SISTERS WITH HER FOR COMPANY SO THEY SET OUT IN A COACH WHICH WAS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM AND HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR WHEN THE HOODIE SUDDENLY SAID
HE RECKONED HIS ACCOUNTS AND FOUND THAT HE HAD ONLY FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS LEFT THEN A STRANGE REACTION TOOK PLACE
THE GIRL WAS SURPRISED AT HIS WORDS FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A HOODIE AT ALL TIMES STILL SHE SAID NOTHING OF THIS AND ONLY REPLIED I WOULD RATHER THOU WERT A MAN BY DAY AND A HOODIE BY NIGHT AND SO HE WAS
AT THE FIRST NOTE OF MUSIC THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN THE FARMER ARRIVED IN THE MORNING TO SEE HIS GRANDSON HE FOUND THEM ALL WEEPING FOR WHILE THEY HAD SLEPT THE BABY HAD VANISHED WELL THE NEXT YEAR IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN
DO YOU WISH TO ASSASSINATE A MAN WHO IN THE EYES OF HEAVEN IS A BROTHER OH MY FORMER FRIENDS MY FORMER FRIENDS HE MURMURED AND FELL WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THEN RISING IN DESPAIR HE EXCLAIMED THE CHIEF THE CHIEF
AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE THIS WAS NOT EASY AS MY UGLINESS WAS SUCH THAT NO ONE WOULD LOOK AT ME A SECOND TIME MY NURSE AND I WERE ALMOST IN DESPAIR AS MY FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS DRAWING NEAR AND I HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS SPOKEN TO A MAN
AND A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO THE FALSE PRINCE FORBIDDING HIM EVER AGAIN TO APPEAR AT COURT THOUGH A HANDSOME PENSION WAS GRANTED HIM AT LAST THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND THE KING SIGNING TO HIS NEWLY FOUND SON TO FOLLOW HIM
BY AND BYE I WAS BORN AND WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY GRANDFATHER IN ONE OF HIS GREAT HOUSES HERE ARE THE RINGS YOU GAVE TO MY MOTHER AND HERE IS THE CROSS AND THESE WILL PROVE IF I AM YOUR SON OR NOT
BUT THEY WERE MORE AMAZED STILL AT THE LIGHTNESS OF HER STEP AS SHE SKIPPED UP THE STEPS TO THE GREAT DOOR BEFORE WHICH THE KING WAS STANDING WITH THE PRINCE AT HIS SIDE IF THEY BOTH FELT A SHOCK AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE AGED LADY THEY DID NOT SHOW IT
IF YOU DEPRIVE ME OF THAT TAKE AWAY MY LIFE ALSO WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO SHED YOUR BLOOD AND BY WHOM ARE YOU FORBIDDEN BY HIM WE OBEY YOU DO THEN OBEY SOME ONE YES A CHIEF
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CARED ABOUT ME AND WE LIVED TOGETHER IN THIS CITY ON A SMALL PENSION ALLOWED ME BY THE KING WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE AN OLD MAN ARRIVED AT OUR HOUSE AND BEGGED MY NURSE TO LET HIM COME IN AND REST AS HE COULD WALK NO LONGER
COULD THAT REALLY BE HIS WIFE THAT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THE PRINCE WAS STILL GAZING IN SURPRISE WHEN THE LADY OPENED HER EYES AND SMILED AT HIM YES I REALLY AM YOUR WIFE SHE SAID AS IF SHE HAD GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS
FOR NONE COULD FIND ANY EXCUSE FOR THE BLOW HE HAD GIVEN TO THE PRINCE THE FOURTEENTH NIGHT HAD COME AND IN DESPAIR THE PRISONER WENT OUT TO TAKE HIS LAST WALK THROUGH THE CITY HE WANDERED ON HARDLY KNOWING WHERE HE WENT
OF WHAT MUST I REPENT STAMMERED DANGLARS OF THE EVIL YOU HAVE DONE SAID THE VOICE
HAD NOT HIS GRANDFATHER THE DUKE STEPPED BETWEEN AND COMMANDED US TO LAY THE AFFAIR BEFORE YOU THE KING HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE STORY AND WHEN IT WAS ENDED HE SAID I SUPPOSE THE PRINCE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE USED THEM
SO SEEING AN ORCHARD ALL PINK AND WHITE WITH APPLE BLOSSOMS AND A GIRL TOSSING A BALL IN ONE CORNER
BUT GO ON WITH YOUR STORY ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE QUEEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN YOUR HIGHNESS WAS HUNTING AND OUTSTRIPPED ALL YOUR ATTENDANTS WHILE CHASING THE DEER YOU WERE IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW
BUT A REBELLION BROKE OUT IN A DISTANT PART OF THE KINGDOM AND CALLED FOR YOUR PRESENCE WHEN NEXT YOU RODE UP TO THE COTTAGE IT WAS EMPTY AND NONE COULD INFORM YOU WHITHER YOUR BRIDE HAD GONE THAT SIRE I CAN NOW TELL YOU
AND THE REAL COOK WHO HAD COME BACK FROM THE RACE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM HE MAY BE THE COOK BUT HE DID NOT COOK THIS FEAST SAID THE BRIDEGROOM AND THEN INQUIRY WAS MADE AND THE GIRL WAS SUMMONED TO THE GREAT HALL THAT IS MY MARRIED WIFE HE DECLARED
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY AFTER THAT A WOMAN BADE HER ENTER AND SET FOOD BEFORE HER AND GAVE HER A SOFT BED TO LIE IN AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE SHE GOT UP AND LEFT THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF THE HOODIE
SO HARD DID SHE WORK THAT IN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE HORSE SHOES EARLY ONE MORNING SHE SET OUT FOR THE HILL OF POISON ON HER HANDS AND FEET SHE WENT BUT EVEN WITH THE HORSE SHOES ON SHE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO STUMBLE
AND THE HOODIE WAS MORE ANGRY THAN BEFORE AND WENT AWAY IN A RAGE HOWEVER
AND WHILE HE SMILED AS HE ATTEMPTED TO REGARD THE AFFAIR AS A JOKE HE FELT HIS TEMPLES GET MOIST WITH PERSPIRATION COME MY FRIEND SAID DANGLARS SEEING THAT HE MADE NO IMPRESSION ON PEPPINO YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME A GLASS OF WINE
YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
THIS DAY EVERYTHING BEFELL AS ON THE TWO OTHER DAYS BUT WHEN SHE REACHED THE SMALL HOUSE THE WOMAN BADE HER KEEP AWAKE AND IF THE HOODIE FLEW INTO THE ROOM TO TRY TO SEIZE HIM
WHO BY THIS TIME COULD SCARCELY BE SEEN EVEN IN THE MOONLIGHT WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED A WOMAN PAST NINETY COULD WALK WITH SUCH SPEED IT SEEMED MORE LIKE FLYING BUT AT LENGTH BREATHLESS AND EXHAUSTED HE REACHED HER SIDE AND GASPED OUT
AND THE KING WITH A GRAVE BOW TOOK HER BAND AND LED HER TO THE CHAPEL WHERE A BISHOP WAS WAITING TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY
AND HOW HE HAD SWORN BEFORE A PRIEST TO MARRY HER THOUGH HE DID NOT WANT TO DO IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGES AND BESIDES HE WOULD RATHER RECEIVE A BRIDE CHOSEN BY THE KING HIMSELF BUT THE KING FROWNED AND ANSWERED SHARPLY
DANGLARS UTTERED A CRY AND FELL PROSTRATE RISE SAID THE COUNT YOUR LIFE IS SAFE THE SAME GOOD FORTUNE HAS NOT HAPPENED TO YOUR ACCOMPLICES ONE IS MAD
AND COOKED THE FEAST IN A KITCHEN THAT LOOKED INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE COMPANY WERE TO EAT IT AFTER THAT SHE WATCHED THE SEAT WHERE THE BRIDEGROOM WAS SITTING
BEFORE HIM THE OLD WOMAN BADE THE PRISONER SWEAR THAT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND THIS HE DID IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES THEN BEGGING THE PRIEST AND THE GUARDS TO LEAVE THEM ALONE FOR A LITTLE SHE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HE WAS TO DO
WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST OH NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE FLASH OF ANGER WHICH DARTED FROM HER EYES MADE HIM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE HOWEVER ALL SHE SAID WAS AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU REJECT ME LET THE CROWS HAVE YOU
YES YOUR EXCELLENCY WHAT THEN
BY THEIR ADVICE HE SPENT THE FOURTEEN DAYS THAT REMAINED TO HIM GOING ABOUT TO SEEK COUNSEL FROM WISE MEN OF ALL SORTS AS TO HOW HE MIGHT ESCAPE DEATH BUT NO ONE COULD HELP HIM
HERE LET ME SEE HIM CERTAINLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT LUIGI VAMPA APPEARED BEFORE DANGLARS YOU SENT FOR ME HE SAID TO THE PRISONER
FOR IT WAS SUMMER AND EVERYONE ROSE EARLY AND RESTED FROM TWELVE TO THREE AS THEY DO IN HOT COUNTRIES HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF IN COOL WHITE CLOTHES AND WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL ON HIS WAY TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
I WOULD RATHER DIE AT ONCE YOU MAY TORTURE TORMENT KILL ME BUT YOU SHALL NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE AGAIN AS YOUR EXCELLENCY PLEASES SAID VAMPA AS HE LEFT THE CELL DANGLARS RAVING THREW HIMSELF ON THE GOAT SKIN WHO COULD THESE MEN BE
AND SOMETIMES SHE SAW HIM ON THE TOP BUT WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP HE HAD FLOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE VALLEY HE WAS ON THE TOP OF ANOTHER HILL AND SO IT HAPPENED TILL NIGHT CAME ROUND AGAIN
NO AND YET YOU WILL LET ME PERISH WITH HUNGER AH THAT IS A DIFFERENT THING WELL THEN WRETCHES CRIED DANGLARS I WILL DEFY YOUR INFAMOUS CALCULATIONS
COME COME CALM YOURSELF YOU WILL EXCITE YOUR BLOOD AND THAT WOULD PRODUCE AN APPETITE IT WOULD REQUIRE A MILLION A DAY TO SATISFY BE MORE ECONOMICAL BUT WHEN I HAVE NO MORE MONEY LEFT TO PAY YOU
SOMETIMES HE WAS DELIRIOUS AND FANCIED HE SAW AN OLD MAN STRETCHED ON A PALLET HE ALSO WAS DYING OF HUNGER ON THE FOURTH HE WAS NO LONGER A MAN BUT A LIVING CORPSE
THE GIRL AWOKE WITH A START AND LEANT FORWARD TO GRASP HIM BUT HE WAS ALREADY FLYING OFF AND SHE ONLY SEIZED A FEATHER FROM HIS WING AND WHEN DAWN CAME SHE GOT UP AND TOLD THE WOMAN HE HAS GONE OVER THE HILL OF POISON SAID SHE
HE HAD CONCEALED HALF OF HIS FOWL AND A PIECE OF THE BREAD IN THE CORNER OF HIS CELL BUT HE HAD NO SOONER EATEN THAN HE FELT THIRSTY HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE STRUGGLED AGAINST HIS THIRST TILL HIS TONGUE CLAVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH
THEN NO LONGER ABLE TO RESIST HE CALLED OUT THE SENTINEL OPENED THE DOOR IT WAS A NEW FACE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE SO HE SENT FOR PEPPINO
WHEN A NUMBER OF YOUNG NOBLES SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE HIM AND ONE AMONGST THEM STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE SIRE THIS MORNING WE WERE ALL PLAYING TENNIS IN THE COURT THE PRINCE AND THIS GENTLEMAN WITH THE REST
AND SOONER THAN GIVE THEM UP HE RESOLVED TO ENTER AGAIN UPON A LIFE OF PRIVATION HE WAS DELUDED BY THE HOPEFULNESS THAT IS A PREMONITION OF MADNESS HE WHO FOR SO LONG A TIME HAD FORGOTTEN GOD BEGAN TO THINK THAT MIRACLES WERE POSSIBLE
SO WHEN HE BEHELD A WOMAN WHOM HE DID NOT KNOW COMING ALONG THE STREET HOPE SPRANG UP IN HIM WILL YOU COOK THE WEDDING FEAST IN PLACE OF ME HE SAID AND I WILL PAY YOU WELL WHEN I RETURN FROM THE RACE GLADLY SHE AGREED
AND THEY SOON DETERMINED THAT THE WHOLE NIGHT SHOULD BE ONE SMOKING FESTIVAL THE POOR FELLOWS HAD ONLY A CRACKED BOWL
OR THE INSINUATION OF A PUN MORE CORDIALLY THAN MY FATHER HE WOULD GROW TESTY UPON IT AT ANY TIME BUT TO BE BROKE IN UPON BY ONE IN A SERIOUS DISCOURSE WAS AS BAD HE WOULD SAY AS A FILLIP UPON THE NOSE
AND THAT HE REALLY MIGHT HAVE ABSORBED SOME CHRISTIAN ERRORS WHEN ALL WAS READY FOR DEPARTURE
WHICH IS USUALLY MADE UPON THE CONCLUSION OF ANY SORT OF TREATY BUT ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE WERE SO MISERABLY POOR THEY SEEMED TO LOOK UPON THE PECUNIARY PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT AS A MATTER QUITE TRIVIAL IN COMPARISON WITH THE TESKERI
FOR THAT PART OF THE WALL OR RAMPART WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE TWO BASTIONS AND JOINS THEM BESIEGERS SELDOM OFFER TO CARRY ON THEIR ATTACKS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE CURTIN FOR THIS REASON BECAUSE THEY ARE SO WELL FLANKED
THE POOR BEASTS HAD A HARD STRUGGLE FOR THEIR LIVES IN THAT SWIFT STREAM AND I THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED FOR HE WAS TOO WEAK TO GAIN A FOOTING ON THE WESTERN BANK AND THE STREAM BORE HIM DOWN
BUT HE WAS OF A PEACEFUL PLACID NATURE NO JARRING ELEMENT IN IT ALL WAS MIXED UP SO KINDLY WITHIN HIM MY UNCLE TOBY HAD SCARCE A HEART TO RETALIATE UPON A FLY GO SAYS HE ONE DAY AT DINNER
AND LOOKING UP INTO MY FATHER'S FACE WITH A COUNTENANCE SPREAD OVER WITH SO MUCH GOOD NATURE SO PLACID SO FRATERNAL SO INEXPRESSIBLY TENDER TOWARDS HIM IT PENETRATED MY FATHER TO HIS HEART
I KNOW NO MAN UNDER WHOSE ARM I WOULD HAVE SOONER TAKEN SHELTER NOR DID THIS ARISE FROM ANY INSENSIBILITY OR OBTUSENESS OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PARTS FOR HE FELT THIS INSULT OF MY FATHER'S AS FEELINGLY AS A MAN COULD DO
SO MUCH AS A PRELIMINARY WELL NEXT OUR CUT ONE IS AS IF YOU WERE SOWING YOUR CORN SO BATHSHEBA SAW A SORT OF RAINBOW UPSIDE DOWN IN THE AIR AND TROY'S ARM WAS STILL AGAIN CUT TWO
BY HEAVEN TIS COWARDLY YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME BROTHER QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HAD IT BEEN FIFTY TIMES AS MUCH BESIDES WHAT HAVE I TO DO MY DEAR TOBY CRIED MY FATHER EITHER WITH YOUR AMUSEMENTS OR YOUR PLEASURES
THE TENTED ARABS ARE LOOKED UPON AS VERY BAD MAHOMETANS WE ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVERNOT
YOU ARE MY ANTAGONIST WITH THIS DIFFERENCE FROM REAL WARFARE THAT I SHALL MISS YOU EVERY TIME BY ONE HAIR'S BREADTH OR PERHAPS TWO MIND YOU DON'T FLINCH WHATEVER YOU DO I'LL BE SURE NOT TO SHE SAID INVINCIBLY
WERE CARRIED OFF BY THE SOLDIERY
SHE SAW THE POINT GLISTEN TOWARDS HER BOSOM AND SEEMINGLY ENTER IT BATHSHEBA CLOSED HER EYES IN THE FULL PERSUASION THAT SHE WAS KILLED AT LAST HOWEVER FEELING JUST AS USUAL SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN
WHICH HAD ALL BEEN TAKEN FROM THE PACK SADDLES AND PLACED UPON THE GROUND I WAS SO LANGUID FROM WANT OF FOOD THAT I HAD SCARCELY ANIMATION ENOUGH TO FEEL AS DEEPLY INTERESTED AS YOU WOULD SUPPOSE IN THE RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION
AND BATHSHEBA APPEARED IN THEIR MIDST THEIR SOFT FEATHERY ARMS CARESSING HER UP TO HER SHOULDERS SHE PAUSED TURNED WENT BACK OVER THE HILL AND HALF WAY TO HER OWN DOOR
BUT NOT ONCE TOUCH YOU I DON'T THINK I AM AFRAID YOU ARE QUITE SURE YOU WILL NOT HURT ME QUITE SURE IS THE SWORD VERY SHARP O NO ONLY STAND AS STILL AS A STATUE NOW
HAVE DONE FOR ME IN THAT RESPECT OR DISCREDIT THE OTHER HELPS OF AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION BESTOWED UPON ME BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD SINCE YET I OFTEN THINK THAT I OWE ONE HALF OF MY PHILANTHROPY TO THAT ONE ACCIDENTAL IMPRESSION
ON THIS A PORTION OF MY BAGGAGE WAS PLACED AND WAS FIRMLY TIED TO IT BY THE CORDS USED ON MY PACK SADDLES THE LITTLE RAFT WITH ITS WEIGHTY CARGO WAS THEN GENTLY LIFTED INTO THE WATER
NOW JUST TO LEARN WHETHER YOU HAVE PLUCK ENOUGH TO LET ME DO WHAT I WISH I'LL GIVE YOU A PRELIMINARY TEST HE FLOURISHED THE SWORD BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION NUMBER TWO
IN THAT WAY THEY PASSED THE WHOLE NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING OLD SHEREEF WAS BROUGHT ACROSS IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT TO SEE THIS SOLEMN OLD MUSSULMAN WITH HIS SHAVEN HEAD AND HIS SACRED BEARD
THIS PROPOSAL WAS RECEIVED AND INSTANTLY ACCEPTED BY ALL THE MEN OF THE TRIBE THERE PRESENT WITH THE UTMOST ENTHUSIASM I WAS TO GIVE THE MEN TOO A BAKSHEISH THAT IS A PRESENT OF MONEY
THE FELLOWS ALL GATHERED TOGETHER IN CIRCLE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM MY PARTY AND THERE DISPUTED WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE AND FURY FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS I CANT GIVE A CORRECT REPORT OF THE DEBATE
HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE DEBATE WHICH INDEED WAS CARRIED ON AT A DISTANCE TOO GREAT TO BE EASILY HEARD EVEN IF THE LANGUAGE HAD BEEN FAMILIAR BUT HE WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND NOW AND THEN CONFERRING WITH MEN WHO HAD STRAGGLED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY
SPRAWLING AND PUFFING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED THE BANK THE PEOPLE TOLD HIM THAT BY HIS BAPTISM IN JORDAN HE HAD SURELY BECOME A MERE CHRISTIAN
HE SAW NO DIFFERENCE SIR QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO DOCTOR SLOP THE CURTINS MY BROTHER SHANDY MENTIONS HERE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH BEADSTEADS
WHICH AS THEY WOUND THE SOUL OF MAN PRODUCE THIS MELANCHOLY AND MANY GREAT INCONVENIENCES BY THAT ANTIDOTE OF GOOD COUNSEL AND PERSUASION MAY BE EASED OR EXPELLED DEFORMITIES AND IMPERFECTIONS OF OUR BODIES
ATTUNED BY MERCY MIGHT FIND A PASSAGE TO MY HEART I KNOW NOT THIS I KNOW THAT THE LESSON OF UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL THEN TAUGHT AND IMPRINTED BY MY UNCLE TOBY HAS NEVER SINCE BEEN WORN OUT OF MY MIND
HE DREW NEAR AND SAID I MUST BE LEAVING YOU HE DREW NEARER STILL A MINUTE LATER AND SHE SAW HIS SCARLET FORM DISAPPEAR AMID THE FERNY THICKET ALMOST IN A FLASH LIKE A BRAND SWIFTLY WAVED
WHICH WILL SERVE TO GIVE AWAY TO OBADIAH WHEN HE GETS BACK THAT THIS SAME STEVINUS WAS SOME ENGINEER OR OTHER OR HAS WROTE SOMETHING OR OTHER EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY UPON THE SCIENCE OF FORTIFICATION
AS IF YOU WERE HEDGING SO THREE AS IF YOU WERE REAPING SO FOUR AS IF YOU WERE THRESHING IN THAT WAY THEN THE SAME ON THE LEFT THE THRUSTS ARE THESE ONE TWO THREE FOUR RIGHT
SO AS TO CUT OFF THE RETREAT OF THIS TRIBE AND THEN SURROUNDED THEM AS THEY LAY ENCAMPED IN THE VALE
AND I HAD THE SATISFACTION TO SEE THAT IT FLOATED WELL TWELVE OF THE ARABS NOW STRIPPED AND TIED INFLATED SKINS TO THEIR LOINS
THIS IS TO SERVE FOR PARENTS AND GOVERNORS INSTEAD OF A WHOLE VOLUME UPON THE SUBJECT I COULD NOT GIVE THE READER THIS STROKE IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S PICTURE BY THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH I DREW THE OTHER PARTS OF IT
AND IN THE LITTLE EBULLITIONS OF THIS SUBACID HUMOUR TOWARDS OTHERS BUT PARTICULARLY TOWARDS MY UNCLE TOBY WHOM HE TRULY LOVED HE WOULD FEEL MORE PAIN TEN TIMES TOLD
WHICH INSTANTLY SET MY WHOLE FRAME INTO ONE VIBRATION OF MOST PLEASURABLE SENSATION OR HOW FAR THE MANNER AND EXPRESSION OF IT MIGHT GO TOWARDS IT OR IN WHAT DEGREE OR BY WHAT SECRET MAGICK A TONE OF VOICE AND HARMONY OF MOVEMENT
MY UNCLE TOBY WAS A MAN PATIENT OF INJURIES NOT FROM WANT OF COURAGE I HAVE TOLD YOU IN A FORMER CHAPTER THAT HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE AND WILL ADD HERE THAT WHERE JUST OCCASIONS PRESENTED OR CALLED IT FORTH
AT LAST HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A PROPOSAL WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED IMMENSE SENSATION HE OFFERED ON MY BEHALF THAT IF THE TRIBE SHOULD BEAR THEMSELVES LOYALLY TOWARDS ME
THEY ARE A VERY CONSIDERABLE PART OF AN OUTWORK THEY ARE CALLED BY THE FRENCH ENGINEERS OUVRAGE A CORNE AND WE GENERALLY MAKE THEM TO COVER SUCH PLACES AS WE SUSPECT TO BE WEAKER THAN THE REST
AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO EXTORT ANY FURTHER REWARD
A HALF MOON IN THAT CASE IS NOT A HALF MOON
FOUND LUNGS TO ANSWER THE CRY AND SHOUTING BACK THE NAME OF THEIR GREAT DESTROYER THEY DASHED ON THROUGH THE TORRENT AND BORE THE RAFT IN SAFETY TO THE WESTERN BANK AFTERWARDS THE SWIMMERS RETURNED WITH THE RAFT
REFLECTED LIGHT UPON EACH OTHER AND APPEARED WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THIS AFFAIR WHICH AROSE ABOUT STEVINUS I NEED NOT TELL THE READER IF HE KEEPS A HOBBY HORSE THAT A MAN'S HOBBY HORSE IS AS TENDER A PART AS HE HAS ABOUT HIM
RISING UP BY MY FATHER'S HELP SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME HAD IT BEEN TEN TIMES AS MUCH BROTHER
THAT WAS TO GET YOU TO STAND STILL AND SO MAKE SURE OF YOUR SAFETY THE RISK OF INJURING YOU THROUGH YOUR MOVING WAS TOO GREAT NOT TO FORCE ME TO TELL YOU A FIB TO ESCAPE IT SHE SHUDDERED I HAVE BEEN WITHIN AN INCH OF MY LIFE AND DIDN'T KNOW IT
AND CAREFULLY PUT IT INSIDE SHE FELT POWERLESS TO WITHSTAND OR DENY HIM HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR HER AND BATHSHEBA SEEMED AS ONE WHO FACING A REVIVING WIND FINDS IT BLOW SO STRONGLY THAT IT STOPS THE BREATH
THERE IT IS LOOK SAID THE SERGEANT HOLDING HIS SWORD BEFORE HER EYES THE CATERPILLAR WAS SPITTED UPON ITS POINT WHY IT IS MAGIC SAID BATHSHEBA AMAZED OH NO DEXTERITY
CHAPTER FIFTEEN PASSAGE OF THE JORDAN AND NOW DTHEMETRI BEGAN TO ENTER INTO A NEGOTIATION WITH MY HOSTS FOR A PASSAGE OVER THE RIVER
I TOOK MY SEAT UPON THE TOP OF THE CARGO AND THE RAFT THUS LADEN PASSED THE RIVER IN THE SAME WAY AND WITH THE SAME STRUGGLE AS BEFORE THE SKINS HOWEVER NOT BEING PERFECTLY AIR TIGHT HAD LOST A GREAT PART OF THEIR BUOYANCY
NO YOU HAVE NOT WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE I HAVE NOT TOUCHED YOU SAID TROY QUIETLY IT WAS MERE SLEIGHT OF HAND THE SWORD PASSED BEHIND YOU NOW YOU ARE NOT AFRAID ARE YOU BECAUSE IF YOU ARE I CAN'T PERFORM
ALL EMITTED IN THE MARVELLOUS EVOLUTIONS OF TROY'S REFLECTING BLADE WHICH SEEMED EVERYWHERE AT ONCE AND YET NOWHERE SPECIALLY THESE CIRCLING GLEAMS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A KEEN RUSH THAT WAS ALMOST A WHISTLING
YET IN THE LITTLE RUBS AND VEXATIONS OF LIFE TWAS APT TO SHEW ITSELF IN A DROLLISH AND WITTY KIND OF PEEVISHNESS HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION
HE HAD A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND QUICK SENSIBILITY OF NATURE ATTENDED WITH A LITTLE SORENESS OF TEMPER THO THIS NEVER TRANSPORTED HIM TO ANY THING WHICH LOOKED LIKE MALIGNANCY
I LAY THAT NIGHT ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM ME THE ARABS KINDLED A FIRE ROUND WHICH THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE THEY WERE MADE MOST SAVAGELY HAPPY BY THE TOBACCO WITH WHICH I SUPPLIED THEM
THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS MET BY A CIRCULAR HORIZON OF FERN THIS GREW NEARLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE AND THEN ABRUPTLY CEASED THE MIDDLE WITHIN THE BELT OF VERDURE WAS FLOORED WITH A THICK FLOSSY CARPET OF MOSS AND GRASS INTERMINGLED
NEVER SINCE THE BROADSWORD BECAME THE NATIONAL WEAPON HAD THERE BEEN MORE DEXTERITY SHOWN IN ITS MANAGEMENT THAN BY THE HANDS OF SERGEANT TROY AND NEVER HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH SPLENDID TEMPER FOR THE PERFORMANCE AS NOW IN THE EVENING SUNSHINE
HE ROSE UP HASTILY FROM HIS CHAIR AND SEIZING HOLD OF BOTH MY UNCLE TOBY'S HANDS AS HE SPOKE BROTHER TOBY SAID HE I BEG THY PARDON FORGIVE I PRAY THEE THIS RASH HUMOUR WHICH MY MOTHER GAVE ME
TOGETHER WITH THE PROMISED BAKSHEISH HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL AND I PARTED IN A VERY FRIENDLY WAY FROM THIS RAGGED TRIBE IN TWO OR THREE HOURS I GAINED RIHAH
THE PIT WAS A SAUCER SHAPED CONCAVE NATURALLY FORMED WITH A TOP DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY FEET AND SHALLOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SUNSHINE TO REACH THEIR HEADS STANDING IN THE CENTRE
I THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT THE PLEASANTEST TOYS TO PLAY WITH DURING THIS INTERVAL WERE MY PISTOLS AND NOW AND THEN WHEN I LISTLESSLY VISITED MY LOADED BARRELS WITH THE SWIVEL RAMRODS OR DREW A SWEET MUSICAL CLICK FROM MY ENGLISH FIRELOCKS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I EXERCISED A SLIGHT AND GENTLE INFLUENCE ON THE DEBATE
AND TROY RETURNED THE WEAPON TO THE SCABBARD BATHSHEBA OVERCOME BY A HUNDRED TUMULTUOUS FEELINGS RESULTING FROM THE SCENE ABSTRACTEDLY SAT DOWN ON A TUFT OF HEATHER I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW SAID TROY SOFTLY
FOR ALL WHO HAVE DONE HIM ANY BOLD AND VIOLENT WRONG
ONE TWO THREE FOUR LEFT HE REPEATED THEM HAVE EM AGAIN HE SAID ONE TWO SHE HURRIEDLY INTERRUPTED I'D RATHER NOT THOUGH I DON'T MIND YOUR TWOS AND FOURS BUT YOUR ONES AND THREES ARE TERRIBLE
THE COMMON MEN WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE OF FORTIFICATION CONFOUND THE RAVELIN AND THE HALF MOON TOGETHER THO THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS NOT IN THEIR FIGURE OR CONSTRUCTION FOR WE MAKE THEM EXACTLY ALIKE IN ALL POINTS
INFLATED SKINS WERE FASTENED TO THEIR LOINS AND THUS SUPPORTED THEY WERE TUGGED ACROSS BY ARABS SWIMMING ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM THE HORSES AND MULES WERE THROWN INTO THE WATER AND FORCED TO SWIM OVER
AND BEHIND ALL TROY HIMSELF MOSTLY FACING HER SOMETIMES TO SHOW THE REAR CUTS HALF TURNED AWAY HIS EYE NEVERTHELESS ALWAYS KEENLY MEASURING HER BREADTH AND OUTLINE
FOR IT WAS HELD IN A BARBAROUS DIALECT OF THE ARABIC UNKNOWN TO MY DRAGOMAN I RECOLLECT I SINCERELY FELT AT THE TIME THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ROBBING ME MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST UNANSWERABLE
PRAY SIR WHAT SAID HE HOW DID HE BEHAVE O SIR IT WAS GREAT FOR AS SOON AS MY FATHER HAD DONE INSULTING HIS HOBBY HORSE HE TURNED HIS HEAD WITHOUT THE LEAST EMOTION FROM DOCTOR SLOP TO WHOM HE WAS ADDRESSING HIS DISCOURSE
DEFORMITY OF BODY SICKNESS BASENESS OF BIRTH PECULIAR DISCONTENTS PARTICULAR DISCONTENTS AND GRIEVANCES ARE EITHER OF BODY MIND OR FORTUNE
LET THAT QUESTION BE ANSWERED BY LET THE FACTS BE GRANTED LET THESE INSTANCES SUFFICE LET THIS BE THE RECORD MADE
LANGUAGE IS INADEQUATE TO VOICE MY APPRECIATION LASTLY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND LASTLY IT CAN NOT BE DENIED LESS THAN THIS COULD NOT BE SAID
LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION NOW TO LET ME ENTREAT YOU TO EXAMINE LET ME GIVE ONE MORE INSTANCE LET ME GIVE ONE PARTING WORD LET ME GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION
LET US NOW TURN OUR CONSIDERATION LET US OBSERVE THIS ANALOGY LET US PASS ON TO ANOTHER FACT LET US PAUSE A MOMENT LET US PUSH THE INQUIRY YET FURTHER
LET US CHERISH LET US CONFIRM OUR OPINION LET US CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT LET US DEVOTE OURSELVES LET US DISCARD ALL PREJUDICE LET US DO ALL WE CAN

LET ME ASK YOU TO IMAGINE LET ME ASK YOUR LEAVE TO PROPOSE LET ME BE ALLOWED TO DEVOTE A FEW WORDS LET ME CALL ATTENTION TO ANOTHER FACT LET ME COMMEND TO YOU
LET US RATHER LISTEN TO LET US REFLECT HOW VAIN LET US REMEMBER THIS LET US REMIND OURSELVES LET US RESOLVE
LET ME ADD ANOTHER THING LET ME ADD MY FINAL WORD LET ME ADD ONE OTHER HINT LET ME ALSO SAY A WORD IN REGARD LET ME ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
LET THIS INSPIRE US WITH ABHORRENCE OF LET US APPROACH THE SUBJECT FROM ANOTHER SIDE LET US ATTEMPT A SURVEY LET US BE PERFECTLY JUST LET US BE QUITE PRACTICAL
LET US BEAR PERPETUALLY IN MIND LET US BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING LET US BEGIN BY EXAMINING LET US BRIEFLY REVIEW LET US BRUSH ASIDE ONCE FOR ALL
LET US DRAW AN ILLUSTRATION LET US ENDEAVOR TO UNDERSTAND LET US ENUMERATE LET US FIGURE TO OURSELVES LET US FOR THE MOMENT PUT ASIDE
MEN ARE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING MEN ARE TELLING US NOWADAYS MEN EVERYWHERE TESTIFY MORE AND MORE IT IS FELT MORE THAN ONCE HAVE I HAD TO EXPRESS
LET US NOT BE FEARFUL LET US NOT BE MISLED LET US NOT BE MISUNDERSTOOD LET US NOT FLATTER OURSELVES LET US NOT FOR A MOMENT FORGET
MY APPRECIATION HAS BEEN QUICKENED MY BELIEF THEREFORE IS MY DUTY IS TO ENDEAVOR TO SHOW MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME MY FIRST DUTY IS TO EXPRESS TO YOU
LET US THEN BE WORTHY OF LET US THEREFORE SAY ONCE FOR ALL LET US TRY TO FORM A MENTAL PICTURE LET US TURN TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF
IT STRUCK ME WITH AWFUL FORCE IT WAS THE BLOOD STAINED GATE THE ENTRANCE TO THE HELL OF SLAVERY THROUGH WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO PASS IT WAS A MOST TERRIBLE SPECTACLE I WISH I COULD COMMIT TO PAPER THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH I BEHELD IT
TO THE RICE SWAMP DANK AND LONE FROM VIRGINIA HILLS AND WATERS
THEY REGARDED IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THEM BY THEIR OVERSEERS AND IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS A CONSTANT DESIRE TO BE OUT OF THE FIELD FROM UNDER THE DRIVER'S LASH THAT THEY ESTEEMED IT A HIGH PRIVILEGE ONE WORTH CAREFUL LIVING FOR
AND HER PRESENT OWNERS FINDING SHE WAS OF BUT LITTLE VALUE HER FRAME ALREADY RACKED WITH THE PAINS OF OLD AGE AND COMPLETE HELPLESSNESS FAST STEALING OVER HER ONCE ACTIVE LIMBS THEY TOOK HER TO THE WOODS BUILT HER A LITTLE HUT PUT UP A LITTLE MUD CHIMNEY
I CAN NEVER GET RID OF THAT CONCEPTION
ONE DAUGHTER LUCRETIA AND HER HUSBAND CAPTAIN THOMAS AULD THEY LIVED IN ONE HOUSE UPON THE HOME PLANTATION OF COLONEL EDWARD LLOYD MY MASTER WAS COLONEL LLOYD'S CLERK AND SUPERINTENDENT
I RESOLVED TO WAIT ONLY SO LONG AS THE OFFERING OF A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY
DEATH SOON ENDED WHAT LITTLE WE COULD HAVE WHILE SHE LIVED AND WITH IT HER HARDSHIPS AND SUFFERING SHE DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD ON ONE OF MY MASTER'S FARMS NEAR LEE'S MILL I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT DURING HER ILLNESS AT HER DEATH OR BURIAL
AND MAKE A GRATIFICATION OF THEIR WICKED DESIRES PROFITABLE AS WELL AS PLEASURABLE FOR BY THIS CUNNING ARRANGEMENT THE SLAVEHOLDER IN CASES NOT A FEW SUSTAINS TO HIS SLAVES THE DOUBLE RELATION OF MASTER AND FATHER
ALREADY WASTED A LARGE PORTION OF HIS FATHER'S PROPERTY WE ALL FELT THAT WE MIGHT AS WELL BE SOLD AT ONCE TO THE GEORGIA TRADERS AS TO PASS INTO HIS HANDS
FOR DURING THIS INTERVAL A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MASTER HUGH AND HIS ONCE KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE THE INFLUENCE OF BRANDY UPON HIM AND OF SLAVERY UPON HER HAD EFFECTED A DISASTROUS CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS OF BOTH
THE TIME FOR THE EXERCISE OF THAT TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION WHICH CHILDREN ONLY CAN EXERCISE TOWARDS A DECLINING PARENT MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER THE DEVOTED MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN IS LEFT ALL ALONE IN YONDER LITTLE HUT
HAD HE BEEN A MAN OF PURE MORALS HIMSELF HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THE INNOCENCE OF MY AUNT BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM WILL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF ANY SUCH VIRTUE BEFORE HE COMMENCED WHIPPING AUNT HESTER HE TOOK HER INTO THE KITCHEN
THERE WERE NO BEDS GIVEN THE SLAVES UNLESS ONE COARSE BLANKET BE CONSIDERED SUCH AND NONE BUT THE MEN AND WOMEN HAD THESE THIS HOWEVER IS NOT CONSIDERED A VERY GREAT PRIVATION
I SPENT TWO YEARS OF CHILDHOOD ON THIS PLANTATION IN MY OLD MASTER'S FAMILY IT WAS HERE THAT I WITNESSED THE BLOODY TRANSACTION RECORDED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER AND AS I RECEIVED MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF SLAVERY ON THIS PLANTATION I WILL GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION OF IT
THAN FROM THE COUNTRY I SAILED FROM BALTIMORE FOR SAINT MICHAEL'S IN THE SLOOP AMANDA CAPTAIN EDWARD DODSON ON MY PASSAGE I PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DIRECTION WHICH THE STEAMBOATS
THEY SELDOM COME NEARER TO IT THAN PLANTING TIME HARVEST TIME CHERRY TIME SPRING TIME OR FALL TIME A WANT OF INFORMATION CONCERNING MY OWN WAS A SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS TO ME EVEN DURING CHILDHOOD
AND WHIP UPON HER NAKED BACK TILL SHE WAS LITERALLY COVERED WITH BLOOD NO WORDS NO TEARS NO PRAYERS FROM HIS GORY VICTIM SEEMED TO MOVE HIS IRON HEART FROM ITS BLOODY PURPOSE THE LOUDER SHE SCREAMED THE HARDER HE WHIPPED
AND EVIDENCE OF A RESTLESS SPIRIT THE NEAREST ESTIMATE I CAN GIVE MAKES ME NOW BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE I COME TO THIS FROM HEARING MY MASTER SAY SOME TIME DURING EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
MY MOTHER AND I WERE SEPARATED WHEN I WAS BUT AN INFANT BEFORE I KNEW HER AS MY MOTHER IT IS A COMMON CUSTOM IN THE PART OF MARYLAND FROM WHICH I RAN AWAY TO PART CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHERS AT A VERY EARLY AGE FREQUENTLY BEFORE THE CHILD HAS REACHED ITS TWELFTH MONTH
CALLED THUS SUDDENLY AWAY SHE LEFT ME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INTIMATION OF WHO MY FATHER WAS THE WHISPER THAT MY MASTER WAS MY FATHER MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE
BUT I WELL REMEMBER IT I NEVER SHALL FORGET IT WHILST I REMEMBER ANY THING IT WAS THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF SUCH OUTRAGES
AND A WHIPPING IS THE PENALTY OF NOT BEING IN THE FIELD AT SUNRISE UNLESS A SLAVE HAS SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM HIS OR HER MASTER TO THE CONTRARY A PERMISSION WHICH THEY SELDOM GET AND ONE THAT GIVES TO HIM THAT GIVES IT THE PROUD NAME OF BEING A KIND MASTER
FOR WHEN THEIR DAY'S WORK IN THE FIELD IS DONE THE MOST OF THEM HAVING THEIR WASHING MENDING AND COOKING TO DO AND HAVING FEW OR NONE OF THE ORDINARY FACILITIES FOR DOING EITHER OF THESE VERY MANY OF THEIR SLEEPING HOURS ARE CONSUMED IN PREPARING FOR THE FIELD THE COMING DAY
IT WAS THEIR BASE INGRATITUDE TO MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER
WERE RANKED WITH HORSES SHEEP AND SWINE THERE WERE HORSES AND MEN CATTLE AND WOMEN PIGS AND CHILDREN ALL HOLDING THE SAME RANK IN THE SCALE OF BEING AND WERE ALL SUBJECTED TO THE SAME NARROW EXAMINATION SILVERY HEADED AGE AND SPRIGHTLY YOUTH
I LEFT BALTIMORE WITH A YOUNG HEART OVERBORNE WITH SADNESS AND A SOUL FULL OF APPREHENSION I TOOK PASSAGE WITH CAPTAIN ROWE IN THE SCHOONER WILD CAT AND AFTER A SAIL OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS I FOUND MYSELF NEAR THE PLACE OF MY BIRTH
I DO NOT REMEMBER HIS FIRST NAME HE WAS GENERALLY CALLED CAPTAIN ANTHONY A TITLE WHICH I PRESUME HE ACQUIRED BY SAILING A CRAFT ON THE CHESAPEAKE BAY HE WAS NOT CONSIDERED A RICH SLAVEHOLDER
I WAS ABSENT FROM BALTIMORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF VALUATION AND DIVISION JUST ABOUT ONE MONTH AND IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SIX VERY SOON AFTER MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE MY MISTRESS LUCRETIA DIED LEAVING HER HUSBAND AND ONE CHILD AMANDA
PLACE HIMSELF IN THE DEEP PINE WOODS AND THERE LET HIM IN SILENCE ANALYZE THE SOUNDS THAT SHALL PASS THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS SOUL AND IF HE IS NOT THUS IMPRESSED IT WILL ONLY BE BECAUSE THERE IS NO FLESH IN HIS OBDURATE HEART
HERE AGAIN MY FEELINGS ROSE UP IN DETESTATION OF SLAVERY I HAD NOW A NEW CONCEPTION OF MY DEGRADED CONDITION PRIOR TO THIS I HAD BECOME IF NOT INSENSIBLE TO MY LOT AT LEAST PARTLY SO
SHE WAS HIRED BY A MISTER STEWART WHO LIVED ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM MY HOME SHE MADE HER JOURNEYS TO SEE ME IN THE NIGHT TRAVELLING THE WHOLE DISTANCE ON FOOT AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DAY'S WORK SHE WAS A FIELD HAND
THAN THE READING OF WHOLE VOLUMES OF PHILOSOPHY ON THE SUBJECT COULD DO I DID NOT WHEN A SLAVE UNDERSTAND THE DEEP MEANING OF THOSE RUDE AND APPARENTLY INCOHERENT SONGS I WAS MYSELF WITHIN THE CIRCLE
BUT MUST STAND BY AND SEE ONE WHITE SON TIE UP HIS BROTHER OF BUT FEW SHADES DARKER COMPLEXION THAN HIMSELF AND PLY THE GORY LASH TO HIS NAKED BACK AND IF HE LISP ONE WORD OF DISAPPROVAL IT IS SET DOWN TO HIS PARENTAL PARTIALITY
I HAVE NO LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE HIGH EXCITEMENT AND DEEP ANXIETY WHICH WERE FELT AMONG US POOR SLAVES DURING THIS TIME OUR FATE FOR LIFE WAS NOW TO BE DECIDED WE HAD NO MORE VOICE IN THAT DECISION THAN THE BRUTES AMONG WHOM WE WERE RANKED
SHE WAS OTHERWISE MANNED BY THE COLONEL'S OWN SLAVES THEIR NAMES WERE PETER ISAAC RICH AND JAKE THESE WERE ESTEEMED VERY HIGHLY BY THE OTHER SLAVES AND LOOKED UPON AS THE PRIVILEGED ONES OF THE PLANTATION
THE SONGS OF THE SLAVE REPRESENT THE SORROWS OF HIS HEART AND HE IS RELIEVED BY THEM ONLY AS AN ACHING HEART IS RELIEVED BY ITS TEARS AT LEAST SUCH IS MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE OFTEN SUNG TO DROWN MY SORROW BUT SELDOM TO EXPRESS MY HAPPINESS
AND HIRED OUT ON SOME FARM A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OFF AND THE CHILD IS PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF AN OLD WOMAN TOO OLD FOR FIELD LABOR FOR WHAT THIS SEPARATION IS DONE I DO NOT KNOW UNLESS IT BE TO HINDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD'S AFFECTION TOWARD ITS MOTHER
TOOK TO GO TO PHILADELPHIA I FOUND INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN ON REACHING NORTH POINT THEY WENT UP THE BAY IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION I DEEMED THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE MY DETERMINATION TO RUN AWAY WAS AGAIN REVIVED
AND TO BLUNT AND DESTROY THE NATURAL AFFECTION OF THE MOTHER FOR THE CHILD THIS IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT I NEVER SAW MY MOTHER TO KNOW HER AS SUCH MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN MY LIFE AND EACH OF THESE TIMES WAS VERY SHORT IN DURATION AND AT NIGHT
CHAPTER EIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER I WENT TO LIVE AT BALTIMORE MY OLD MASTER'S YOUNGEST SON RICHARD DIED AND IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH MY OLD MASTER CAPTAIN ANTHONY DIED
IT WAS ASSOCIATED IN THEIR MINDS WITH GREATNESS A REPRESENTATIVE COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF HIS ELECTION TO A SEAT IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS THAN A SLAVE ON ONE OF THE OUT FARMS WOULD BE OF HIS ELECTION TO DO ERRANDS AT THE GREAT HOUSE FARM
AND QUICKEN MY SYMPATHIES FOR MY BRETHREN IN BONDS IF ANY ONE WISHES TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUL KILLING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY LET HIM GO TO COLONEL LLOYD'S PLANTATION AND ON ALLOWANCE DAY
HE WAS CALLED THE SMARTEST AND MOST TRUSTY FELLOW WHO HAD THIS HONOR CONFERRED UPON HIM THE MOST FREQUENTLY
AND LED HER TO A STOOL UNDER A LARGE HOOK IN THE JOIST PUT IN FOR THE PURPOSE HE MADE HER GET UPON THE STOOL AND TIED HER HANDS TO THE HOOK SHE NOW STOOD FAIR FOR HIS INFERNAL PURPOSE HER ARMS WERE STRETCHED UP AT THEIR FULL LENGTH SO THAT SHE STOOD UPON THE ENDS OF HER TOES
THE BARRIER BETWIXT HIMSELF AND BROTHER HE CONSIDERED IMPASSABLE I THEN HAD TO REGRET THAT I DID NOT AT LEAST MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT MY RESOLUTION TO RUN AWAY FOR THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE TENFOLD GREATER FROM THE CITY
CHAPTER ONE I WAS BORN IN TUCKAHOE NEAR HILLSBOROUGH AND ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM EASTON IN TALBOT COUNTY MARYLAND I HAVE NO ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF MY AGE NEVER HAVING SEEN ANY AUTHENTIC RECORD CONTAINING IT
IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY THAT IT MIGHT BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MISSUS LUCRETIA AND MASTER ANDREW I WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR TO BE VALUED WITH THE OTHER PROPERTY
I KNOW OF SUCH CASES AND IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT SUCH SLAVES INVARIABLY SUFFER GREATER HARDSHIPS AND HAVE MORE TO CONTEND WITH THAN OTHERS THEY ARE IN THE FIRST PLACE A CONSTANT OFFENCE TO THEIR MISTRESS
ALL IS GLOOM THE GRAVE IS AT THE DOOR AND NOW WHEN WEIGHED DOWN BY THE PAINS AND ACHES OF OLD AGE WHEN THE HEAD INCLINES TO THE FEET WHEN THE BEGINNING AND ENDING OF HUMAN EXISTENCE MEET
HE HAD ORDERED HER NOT TO GO OUT EVENINGS AND WARNED HER THAT SHE MUST NEVER LET HIM CATCH HER IN COMPANY WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO HER BELONGING TO COLONEL LLOYD THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME WAS NED ROBERTS GENERALLY CALLED LLOYD'S NED
HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP IN ALMOST CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT A LARGE SLOOP IN CARRYING THEM TO MARKET AT BALTIMORE THIS SLOOP WAS NAMED SALLY LLOYD IN HONOR OF ONE OF THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTERS MY MASTER'S SON IN LAW CAPTAIN AULD WAS MASTER OF THE VESSEL
HE WAS BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY HERE SEVERELY WHIPPED PUT ON BOARD THE SLOOP CARRIED TO BALTIMORE AND SOLD TO AUSTIN WOOLFOLK OR SOME OTHER SLAVE TRADER AS A WARNING TO THE SLAVES REMAINING
THEY WOULD COMPOSE AND SING AS THEY WENT ALONG CONSULTING NEITHER TIME NOR TUNE THE THOUGHT THAT CAME UP CAME OUT
IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN OF SEPARATION THERE WAS THE HORRID DREAD OF FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF MASTER ANDREW HE WAS KNOWN TO US ALL AS BEING A MOST CRUEL WRETCH A COMMON DRUNKARD WHO HAD BY HIS RECKLESS MISMANAGEMENT AND PROFLIGATE DISSIPATION
HE WOULD WHIP HER TO MAKE HER SCREAM AND WHIP HER TO MAKE HER HUSH AND NOT UNTIL OVERCOME BY FATIGUE WOULD HE CEASE TO SWING THE BLOOD CLOTTED COWSKIN I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I EVER WITNESSED THIS HORRIBLE EXHIBITION I WAS QUITE A CHILD
INSTEAD OF THE VOICES OF HER CHILDREN SHE HEARS BY DAY THE MOANS OF THE DOVE
MISTER SEVERE'S PLACE WAS FILLED BY A MISTER HOPKINS HE WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN HE WAS LESS CRUEL LESS PROFANE AND MADE LESS NOISE THAN MISTER SEVERE HIS COURSE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY NO EXTRAORDINARY DEMONSTRATIONS OF CRUELTY
FOR WHICH REASON ITS CONSUMPTION IS VERY CONSIDERABLE BARLEY BROTH BEING A DISH VERY FREQUENT THERE INGREDIENT A SEPARATE PART OF A BODY CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS WHAT IS PEARL BARLEY
UNTIL THEY COOL AND RETAIN THE CURL HOW OFTEN IS THIS OPERATION REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FURNACE EACH TIME BEING MADE LESS HOT THE TEA IS THEN PLACED IN THE STORE HOUSES OR PACKED IN CHESTS
YES EXTREMELY SO THEY STRIKE THE PADDLES WITH SUCH REGULARITY THAT THE CANOES SEEM TO FLY ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME BALANCING THE VESSELS WITH THEIR BODIES TO PREVENT THEIR OVERTURNING DEXTEROUS
WHEN THE INSECT FLIES IT IS RED WHEN IT IS FALLEN BLACK
IN IRELAND THEY HAVE LONG FURNISHED NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THE ENTIRE FOOD OF THE PEOPLE WHAT PART OF THE PLANT IS EATEN THE ROOT WHICH WHEN ROASTED OR BOILED AFFORDS A WHOLESOME AND AGREEABLE MEAL WHAT IS TEA
THE SEEDS FALL OUT AND DROPPING IN VARIOUS PLACES TAKE ROOT SPRING UP AND BECOME TREES PROPAGATED SPREAD EXTENDED MULTIPLIED WHAT ELSE IS OBTAINED FROM THIS TREE
A RENOWNED ROMAN GENERAL IS THE WOOD OF THE CHERRY TREE USEFUL IT IS USED IN CABINET MAKING FOR BOXES AND OTHER ARTICLES WHAT IS BARK THE EXTERIOR PART OF TREES
WHAT ARE ITS USES THE NUTMEG IS MUCH USED IN OUR FOOD AND IS OF EXCELLENT VIRTUE AS A MEDICINE IT ALSO YIELDS AN OIL OF GREAT FRAGRANCE IS THE MACE USED AS A SPICE
AS IT FLOURISHES IN THE NORTHERN CLIME OF PEKIN WHERE THE WINTER IS OFTEN SEVERE AND ALSO ABOUT CANTON WHERE THE HEAT IS SOMETIMES VERY GREAT THE BEST TEA HOWEVER GROWS IN A TEMPERATE CLIMATE THE COUNTRY ABOUT NANKIN
SOMETIMES THEY ARE ONLY BURIED IN THE GROUND IN ANY OF THESE SITUATIONS THEY SWELL AND BURST THEIR SKINS FROM WHICH WHEN DRY THEY ARE CAREFULLY SEPARATED BY RUBBING BETWEEN THE HANDS OR FANNING WHAT IS CAYENNE PEPPER
GREAT QUANTITIES ARE ANNUALLY IMPORTED WHAT ARE ITS USES IT FORMS A PLEASANT ADDITION TO FLAVOR FOOD IT ALSO YIELDS AN AGREEABLE ESSENTIAL OIL AND IS ACCOUNTED THE BEST AND MILDEST OF COMMON SPICES
WITH BUT LITTLE SUCCESS IT MAY YET BECOME A STAPLE PRODUCTION OF SOME PORTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES EVERGREEN RETAINING ITS LEAVES FRESH AND GREEN THROUGH ALL SEASONS HOW IS IT PREPARED FOR USE
WILL GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO THREE BELOW WHO ARE GENERALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN PICKING THE BERRIES THEY ARE THEN SPREAD OUT THINLY AND EXPOSED TO THE SUN AT ITS RISING AND SETTING FOR SOME DAYS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO DRY
AND THEN FORMED INTO TWISTED STICKS WHAT IS SAGO A SUBSTANCE PREPARED FROM THE PITH OF THE SAGO PALM WHICH GROWS NATURALLY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA AND THE INDIES THE PITH
IN ANCIENT TIMES IT WAS CALLED THE DRY NURSE OF ROME AND ITALY FROM ITS FURNISHING WITH CORN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND WE ARE INFORMED BOTH FROM SACRED AND PROFANE HISTORY
WHAT ARE CURRANTS A KIND OF SMALL RAISINS OR DRIED GRAPES WHENCE ARE THEY BROUGHT FROM SEVERAL ISLANDS OF THE ARCHIPELAGO PARTICULARLY ZANTE AND CEPHALONIA AND FROM THE ISTHMUS OF CORINTH IN GREECE
A USEFUL AND NUTRITIOUS GRAIN CULTIVATED IN IMMENSE QUANTITIES IN INDIA CHINA AND MOST EASTERN COUNTRIES IN THE WEST INDIES CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE UNITED STATES AND IN SOUTHERN EUROPE
HOLY WARS SARACENS TURKS OR ARABS HOW IS IT PREPARED THE CANES ARE CRUSHED BETWEEN LARGE ROLLERS IN A MILL AND THE JUICE COLLECTED INTO A LARGE VESSEL PLACED TO RECEIVE IT
NOT THE EXTERIOR OR OUTER BARK BUT THE INNER AND FINER WHICH IS OF SO DURABLE A TEXTURE THAT THERE ARE MANUSCRIPTS WRITTEN ON IT WHICH ARE STILL EXTANT
AND ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BUOYANCY IN WATER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIFE BOATS IT IS ALSO USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF LIFE PRESERVERS AND CORK JACKETS THE GREATEST QUANTITIES ARE BROUGHT FROM CATALONIA IN SPAIN
YES ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE OAK BUT THE BEST OAK BARK IS USED IN TANNING WHAT IS CORK THE THICK SPONGY EXTERNAL BARK OF THE CORK TREE A SPECIES OF OAK
AND BY TRANSPLANTING OLD STUMPS THE CINNAMON TREE IN ITS WILD STATE IS SAID TO BE PROPAGATED BY MEANS OF A KIND OF PIGEONS THAT FEED ON ITS FRUIT IN CARRYING WHICH TO THEIR NESTS
THE BARK BESIDES BEING USED AS A SPICE YIELDS AN OIL HIGHLY ESTEEMED BOTH AS A MEDICINE AND AS A PERFUME THE FRUIT BY BOILING ALSO PRODUCES AN OIL USED BY THE NATIVES FOR BURNING IN LAMPS
EXCEPT AS A CURIOSITY ESCULENT GOOD FOR FOOD FOR WHAT IS MILLET USED IT IS IN GREAT REQUEST AMONGST THE GERMANS FOR PUDDINGS FOR WHICH IT IS SOMETIMES USED AMONGST US
EXCELLENT TO EAT BUT TAKING IT OFF KILLS THE TREE THE COCOA IS A SPECIES OF PALM IS NOT THE INDIAN LIQUOR CALLED TODDY PRODUCED FROM THE COCOA TREE YES
IT IS A LARGE HANDSOME TREE OF THE MYRTLE KIND ITS LEAVES RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE LAUREL THOUGH THE CLOVE TREE IS CULTIVATED TO A GREAT EXTENT YET SO EASILY DOES THE FRUIT ON FALLING TAKE ROOT
BUT AFTERWARDS TRANSPLANTED BY THE DUTCH WHO TRADED IN THEM TO OTHER ISLANDS PARTICULARLY THAT OF TERNATE IT IS NOW FOUND IN MOST OF THE EAST INDIAN ISLANDS DESCRIBE THE CLOVE TREE
THE EAST INDIES LIBERIA ON THE COAST OF AFRICA THE WEST INDIES BRAZIL AND OTHER PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA AS WELL AS IN MOST TROPICAL CLIMATES TROPICAL BEING WITHIN THE TROPICS
MUCH USED IN MEDICINE AND COOKERY THE INDIANS EAT THE ROOT WHEN GREEN AS A SALAD CHOPPING IT SMALL WITH OTHER HERBS THEY ALSO MAKE A CANDY OF IT WITH SUGAR THE GINGER SOLD IN THE SHOPS HERE IS DRIED
WHEN OTHER FOOD IS SCARCE IN WINTER RYE YIELDS A STRONG SPIRIT WHEN DISTILLED DISTILLED SUBJECTED TO DISTILLATION THE OPERATION OF EXTRACTING SPIRIT FROM A SUBSTANCE BY EVAPORATION AND CONDENSATION
WHAT IS NEXT DONE THEY ARE THEN REMOVED WITH A KIND OF SHOVEL RESEMBLING A FAN AND POURED ON MATS WHENCE THEY ARE TAKEN IN SMALL QUANTITIES AND ROLLED IN THE PALM OF THE HAND ALWAYS IN ONE DIRECTION
BY THE STRAIT OF MESSINA WHERE DO THE EGYPTIANS DWELL IN EGYPT A COUNTRY OF AFRICA IT IS EXTREMELY FERTILE PRODUCING GREAT QUANTITIES OF CORN
UNTIL HAVING BEEN EXPOSED FOR SOME TIME TO THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR PROBABLY GATHERED BEFORE PERFECTLY RIPE IT BECOMES BLACK AS IN THE CONDITION WE HAVE IT THERE ARE TWO SORTS THE BLACK AND THE WHITE WHAT IS THE WHITE PEPPER
WHICH IS EVEN EATABLE IN ITS NATURAL STATE IS TAKEN FROM THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND THROWN INTO A VESSEL PLACED OVER A HORSE HAIR SIEVE WATER IS THEN THROWN OVER THE MASS AND THE FINER PARTS OF THE PITH PASS THROUGH THE SIEVE
IT IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL PEA AND HAS SIX LEGS ARMED WITH CLAWS AND A TRUNK BY WHICH IT SUCKS ITS NOURISHMENT WHAT IS ITS HABITATION IT BREEDS IN A FRUIT RESEMBLING A PEAR
THE LEAVES OF THE TREE ARE MADE INTO BASKETS THEY ARE ALSO USED FOR THATCHING HOUSES THE FIBROUS BARK OF THE NUT AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ARE MADE INTO CORDAGE SAILS AND CLOTH THE SHELL INTO DRINKING BOWLS AND CUPS
RAISINS OF THE SUN OR JAR RAISINS SO CALLED FROM BEING IMPORTED IN JARS
THE FRENCH CALL IT ROUND CLOVE FROM ITS ROUND SHAPE AND THE TASTE BEING SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT SPICE WHAT IS PEPPER THE PRODUCT OF A CREEPING SHRUB GROWING IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE EAST INDIES ASIA
WHICH OPENS AS THE FRUIT GROWS THE SHELL IS THE THIRD COVER WHICH IS HARD THIN AND BLACKISH UNDER THIS IS A GREENISH FILM OF NO USE AND IN THE LAST YOU FIND THE NUTMEG WHICH IS THE KERNEL OF THE FRUIT
AND AT LAST YOUNG TREES WERE SENT TO THE BOTANICAL GARDEN AT AMSTERDAM WHO INTRODUCED IT INTO FRANCE AND ENGLAND THEVENOT THE TRAVELLER BROUGHT IT INTO FRANCE AND A GREEK SERVANT NAMED PASQUA
BY CAREFULLY GATHERING THE LEAVES ONE BY ONE WHILE THEY ARE YET SMALL YOUNG AND JUICY THEY ARE THEN SPREAD ON LARGE FLAT IRON PANS AND PLACED OVER SMALL FURNACES
TAKEN TO ENGLAND BY MISTER DANIEL EDWARDS
THE WHITE PEPPER IS MERELY THE BLACK DEPRIVED OF ITS OUTSIDE SKIN FOR THIS PURPOSE THE FINEST RED BERRIES ARE SELECTED AND PUT IN BASKETS TO STEEP EITHER IN RUNNING WATER OR IN PITS DUG FOR THE PURPOSE NEAR THE BANKS OF RIVERS
OF A HOT BITING TASTE AROMATIC FRAGRANT HAVING AN AGREEABLE ODOR WHAT IS CINNAMON AN AGREEABLE AROMATIC SPICE THE BARK OF A TREE OF THE LAUREL KIND
THEY WERE CULTIVATED ONLY IN THE GARDENS OF THE NOBILITY AND WERE RECKONED A GREAT DELICACY THEY NOW CONSTITUTE A PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF FOOD IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND AMERICA
WHAT IS GENERALLY MEANT BY CORN IN THIS COUNTRY MAIZE OR INDIAN CORN IS GENERALLY MEANT BUT IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SENSE THE TERM IS APPLIED TO SEVERAL OTHER KINDS OF GRAIN SUCH AS WHEAT RYE BARLEY
OATS ARE ALSO EATEN BY THE INHABITANTS OF MANY COUNTRIES AFTER BEING GROUND INTO MEAL AND MADE INTO OAT CAKES OATMEAL ALSO FORMS A WHOLESOME DRINK FOR INVALIDS BY STEEPING IT IN BOILING WATER
THEY ARE BORNE IN LARGE CLUSTERS THE TREE SENDS UP NUMEROUS SHOOTS THE THIRD OR FOURTH YEAR AFTER IT HAS BEEN PLANTED THESE SHOOTS ARE PLANTED OUT WHEN NEARLY AN INCH IN THICKNESS HOW IS THE BARK PROCURED
AND IN AMERICA IT IS A NATIVE OF SOUTH EASTERN ASIA AND THE ADJOINING ISLANDS DESCRIBE ITS NATURE AND USE
THE HONOR OF INTRODUCING THIS USEFUL VEGETABLE INTO ENGLAND IS DIVIDED BETWEEN SIR FRANCIS DRAKE IN FIFTEEN EIGHTY AND SIR WALTER RALEIGH IN FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX SOME ASCRIBING IT TO THE FORMER AND OTHERS TO THE LATTER
THAT OF A KIND OF BIRCH IS USED BY THE INDIANS FOR MAKING CANOES WHAT ARE CANOES BOATS USED BY SAVAGES
EXPERT NIMBLE DO THEY LEAVE THEIR CANOES IN THE WATER ON THEIR RETURN FROM A VOYAGE NO THEY DRAW THEM ASHORE HANG THEM UP BY THE TWO ENDS AND LEAVE THEM TO DRY
THE CLOVE WHEN IT FIRST BEGINS TO APPEAR IS WHITE THEN GREEN AND AT LAST HARD AND RED WHEN DRIED IT TURNS YELLOW AND THEN DARK BROWN WHAT ARE ITS QUALITIES
THERE ARE TWO VARIETIES OF THIS TREE THE BROAD LEAVED AND THE NARROW IT IS AN EVERGREEN AND GROWS TO THE HEIGHT OF THIRTY FEET THE CORK TREE ATTAINS TO A VERY GREAT AGE WHERE IS THE TREE FOUND IN SPAIN
THE FIGS SENT FROM ABROAD ARE DRIED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR IN FURNACES FOR THE PURPOSE LUSCIOUS SWEET TO EXCESS CLOYING WHAT IS RICE
AND SENT TO MOST OF THE COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND AMERICA DESCRIBE THE APPEARANCE OF THE TEA TREE THE TEA TREE WHEN ARRIVED AT ITS FULL GROWTH WHICH IT DOES IN ABOUT SEVEN YEARS IS ABOUT A MAN'S HEIGHT THE GREEN LEAVES ARE NARROW AND JAGGED ALL ROUND
WHERE IT IS LARGELY CULTIVATED OF WHAT FORM IS THE FRUIT IT IS SOMEWHAT LIKE A CUCUMBER ABOUT THREE INCHES ROUND AND OF A YELLOWISH RED COLOR IT CONTAINS FROM TEN TO FORTY SEEDS
IT PUTS OUT A LARGE CLUSTER OR BRANCH ON WHICH THE COCOA NUTS HANG TO THE NUMBER OF TEN OR TWELVE
OF ASIA THE INDIES AFRICA ARABIA THE ISLANDS OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC AND THE HOTTEST PARTS OF AMERICA WHAT ARE THE USES OF THIS TREE
TILL THEY ARE OF A DEEP BROWN COLOR AND THEN GROUND TO POWDER AND BOILED METALLIC CONSISTING OF METAL WHAT IS CHOCOLATE A KIND OF CAKE OR PASTE MADE OF THE KERNEL OF THE CACAO NUT
ON A FLOOR OF HARD EARTH OR STONE LYE A LIQUOR MADE FROM WOOD ASHES OF GREAT USE IN MEDICINE BLEACHING
AND SOMETIMES OF PIECES OF BARK FASTENED TOGETHER HOW DO THE SAVAGES GUIDE THEM WITH PADDLES OR OARS THEY SELDOM CARRY SAILS AND THE LOADING IS LAID IN THE BOTTOM ARE NOT THE SAVAGES VERY DEXTEROUS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEM
AND PACKED IN BARRELS FOR EXPORTATION WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY EXPORTATION THE ACT OF CONVEYING GOODS FOR SALE FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER WHAT ARE RAISINS GRAPES PREPARED BY DRYING THEM IN THE SUN
IT APPEARS THAT IN THE CITY OF ADEN IT BECAME IN THE LATTER HALF OF THAT CENTURY A VERY POPULAR DRINK FIRST WITH LAWYERS STUDIOUS PERSONS AND THOSE WHOSE OCCUPATION REQUIRED WAKEFULNESS AT NIGHT AND SOON AFTER WITH ALL CLASSES
DO THEY GROW ON BUSHES LIKE OUR CURRANTS NO ON VINES LIKE OTHER GRAPES EXCEPT THAT THE LEAVES ARE SOMEWHAT THICKER AND THE GRAPES MUCH SMALLER THEY HAVE NO PIPS AND ARE OF A DEEP RED OR RATHER BLACK COLOR
EACH COVERED WITH A LITTLE RIND OF A VIOLET COLOR WHEN THIS IS STRIPPED OFF THE KERNEL OF WHICH THEY MAKE THE CHOCOLATE IS VISIBLE HOW DO THEY MAKE IT INTO A DRINK
OR THE HARD WHITE SUGAR IS THE RAW BROWN SUGAR PREPARED BY REFINING IT TILL ALL FOREIGN MATTER IS REMOVED IS THE SUGAR CANE THE ONLY VEGETABLE THAT PRODUCES SUGAR
BETWEEN WHICH TWO PLACES IT IS SITUATED WHAT PRODUCES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREEN AND BOHEA OR BLACK THERE ARE VARIETIES OF THE PLANT
WERE NOT BOOKS ONCE MADE OF BARK YES THE ANCIENTS WROTE THEIR BOOKS ON THE BARKS OF MANY TREES
POWDERED OVER WITH A KIND OF WHITE DUST FROM WHAT COUNTRIES IS THE COCHINEAL BROUGHT FROM THE WEST INDIES JAMAICA MEXICO AND OTHER PARTS OF AMERICA WHAT ARE CLOVES
THE LIQUOR THUS OBTAINED IS LEFT TO SETTLE THE CLEAR LIQUOR IS THEN DRAWN OFF AND WHAT REMAINS IS FORMED INTO GRAINS BY BEING PASSED THROUGH METAL DISHES WITH NUMEROUS SMALL HOLES IT IS NEXT DRIED BY THE ACTION OF HEAT
EXCEPT THE FAINT IMAGE OF A HOME WHICH THE SHELTER OF HIS MASTER'S ROOF AFFORDS THE NEGRO HAS NO FAMILY WOMAN IS MERELY THE TEMPORARY COMPANION OF HIS PLEASURES
IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK MY SUBJECT HAS OFTEN LED ME TO SPEAK OF THE INDIANS AND THE NEGROES
WHILST IT WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GIVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ITS CHANCES OF DURATION INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS LAWS AND MANNERS WHEN SPEAKING OF THE UNITED REPUBLICAN STATES I HAZARDED NO CONJECTURES UPON THE PERMANENCE OF REPUBLICAN FORMS IN THE NEW WORLD
THE LANGUAGE WHICH HIS FOREFATHERS SPOKE IS NEVER HEARD AROUND HIM HE ABJURED THEIR RELIGION AND FORGOT THEIR CUSTOMS WHEN HE CEASED TO BELONG TO AFRICA WITHOUT ACQUIRING ANY CLAIM TO EUROPEAN PRIVILEGES BUT HE REMAINS HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES SOLD BY THE ONE REPULSED BY THE OTHER
THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THESE TRIBES CONTINUALLY GREW WORSE AND THEY BECAME MORE BARBAROUS AS THEY BECAME MORE WRETCHED NEVERTHELESS THE EUROPEANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO METAMORPHOSE THE CHARACTER OF THE INDIANS
WHICH WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CREEK TERRITORY AN INDIAN WOMAN APPEARED FOLLOWED BY A NEGRESS AND HOLDING BY THE HAND A LITTLE WHITE GIRL OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD WHOM I TOOK TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF THE PIONEER A SORT OF BARBAROUS LUXURY SET OFF THE COSTUME OF THE INDIAN
AND HE IS DESTITUTE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND ENERGY NECESSARY TO RESIST THEM THESE ARE MASTERS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO CONTEND WITH AND HE HAS LEARNT ONLY TO SUBMIT AND OBEY
HAVE ANY EXISTENCE BUT IN THE RECOLLECTION OF MAN
IF HE BECOMES FREE INDEPENDENCE IS OFTEN FELT BY HIM TO BE A HEAVIER BURDEN THAN SLAVERY FOR HAVING LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE TO SUBMIT TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT REASON HE IS TOO MUCH UNACQUAINTED WITH HER DICTATES TO OBEY THEM
AND LIVES AND DIES IN THE MIDST OF THESE DREAMS OF PRIDE FAR FROM DESIRING TO CONFORM HIS HABITS TO OURS HE LOVES HIS SAVAGE LIFE AS THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF HIS RACE AND HE REPELS EVERY ADVANCE TO CIVILIZATION LESS PERHAPS FROM THE HATRED WHICH HE ENTERTAINS FOR IT
THE NEGRESS WAS CLAD IN SQUALID EUROPEAN GARMENTS THEY ALL THREE CAME AND SEATED THEMSELVES UPON THE BANKS OF THE FOUNTAIN
ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS HAD BEEN RAISED BETWEEN THEM BY EDUCATION AND BY LAW AS WELL AS BY THEIR ORIGIN AND OUTWARD CHARACTERISTICS BUT FORTUNE HAS BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER ON THE SAME SOIL WHERE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MIXED THEY DO NOT AMALGAMATE
HE CONFORMS TO THE TASTES OF HIS OPPRESSORS ADOPTS THEIR OPINIONS AND HOPES BY IMITATING THEM TO FORM A PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY HAVING BEEN TOLD FROM INFANCY THAT HIS RACE IS NATURALLY INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE WHITES HE ASSENTS TO THE PROPOSITION AND IS ASHAMED OF HIS OWN NATURE
WHICH EXIST IN EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION PRODUCE RESULTS OF SUCH MAGNITUDE THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST ENSUE FROM THE COLLISION OF THE MOST PERFECT EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION WITH INDIAN SAVAGES MAY READILY BE CONCEIVED THE INDIANS
THE INDIAN IN THE DREARY SOLITUDE OF HIS WOODS CHERISHES THE SAME IDEAS THE SAME OPINIONS AS THE NOBLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES IN HIS CASTLE
RINGS OF METAL WERE HANGING FROM HER NOSTRILS AND EARS
AS EFFECTUALLY AS IF THE FIELDS OF OUR AGRICULTURISTS WERE STRICKEN WITH BARRENNESS AND THEY ARE REDUCED LIKE FAMISHED WOLVES TO PROWL THROUGH THE FORSAKEN WOODS IN QUEST OF PREY
AND ARE GUIDED BY THESE WILD ANIMALS IN THE CHOICE OF THEIR FUTURE COUNTRY
AND THE EFFORT OF NATURE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER RENDERED STILL MORE STRIKING THE IMMENSE DISTANCE PLACED BETWEEN THEM BY PREJUDICE AND BY LAW THE PRESENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE CONDITION OF THE INDIAN TRIBES WHICH INHABIT THE TERRITORY POSSESSED BY THE UNION
THE LOT OF THE NEGRO IS PLACED ON THE EXTREME LIMIT OF SERVITUDE
THE LATTER MEETS WITH A THOUSAND OBSTACLES IN RAISING THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH THE EUROPEAN IS PLACED AMONGST A POPULATION WHOSE WANTS HE KNOWS AND PARTAKES THE SAVAGE IS ISOLATED IN THE MIDST OF A HOSTILE PEOPLE
I HAD PERCEIVED FROM MANY DIFFERENT RESULTS THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE WHITES BUT IN THE PICTURE WHICH I HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBING THERE WAS SOMETHING PECULIARLY TOUCHING A BOND OF AFFECTION HERE UNITED THE OPPRESSORS WITH THE OPPRESSED
HE CANNOT ALWAYS MEET WITH A PURCHASER WHILST THE EUROPEAN READILY FINDS A MARKET AND THE FORMER CAN ONLY PRODUCE AT A CONSIDERABLE COST THAT WHICH THE LATTER VENDS AT A VERY LOW RATE THUS THE INDIAN HAS NO SOONER ESCAPED THOSE EVILS TO WHICH BARBAROUS NATIONS ARE EXPOSED
AND THE VERY NAME OF LAW IS UNKNOWN TO HIM TO BE FREE WITH HIM SIGNIFIES TO ESCAPE FROM ALL THE SHACKLES OF SOCIETY
ON THE SOUTH IT ADVANCES NEARLY TO THE TROPIC AND IT EXTENDS UPWARDS TO THE ICY REGIONS OF THE NORTH THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SCATTERED OVER THIS SPACE DO NOT FORM AS IN EUROPE SO MANY BRANCHES OF THE SAME STOCK THREE RACES NATURALLY DISTINCT
AND EVEN IN OUR MOST INGENIOUS HANDICRAFT HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT THE LABOR OF SLAVES NOT THAT HE IS DEVOID OF ADMIRATION FOR THE POWER AND INTELLECTUAL GREATNESS OF THE WHITES BUT ALTHOUGH THE RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS SURPRISES HIM
IN SHORT HE SINKS TO SUCH A DEPTH OF WRETCHEDNESS THAT WHILE SERVITUDE BRUTALIZES LIBERTY DESTROYS HIM OPPRESSION HAS BEEN NO LESS FATAL TO THE INDIAN THAN TO THE NEGRO RACE BUT ITS EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT
AND PERMIT HIM TO RANK AS THEIR EQUAL UNTIL HE BECOMES THEIR RIVAL THE ONE HAS MIGHT ON HIS SIDE THE OTHER HAS INTELLIGENCE
THEY ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE WAR
AND HAVE BEGUN HIS SLAVERY BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS EXISTENCE
GRADUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NATIVE TRIBES MANNER IN WHICH IT TAKES PLACE MISERIES ACCOMPANYING THE FORCED MIGRATIONS OF THE INDIANS THE SAVAGES OF NORTH AMERICA HAD ONLY TWO WAYS OF ESCAPING DESTRUCTION WAR OR CIVILIZATION
SAVAGE NATIONS ARE ONLY CONTROLLED BY OPINION AND BY CUSTOM WHEN THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS HAD LOST THE SENTIMENT OF ATTACHMENT TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THEIR FAMILIES WERE DISPERSED THEIR TRADITIONS OBSCURED AND THE CHAIN OF THEIR RECOLLECTIONS BROKEN
NEITHER BIRTH NOR FEATURES NOR LANGUAGE NOR HABITS THEIR ONLY RESEMBLANCE LIES IN THEIR MISFORTUNES BOTH OF THEM OCCUPY AN INFERIOR RANK IN THE COUNTRY THEY INHABIT BOTH SUFFER FROM TYRANNY
AND EACH RACE FULFILS ITS DESTINY APART
ENDURING THE VICISSITUDES AND PRACTISING THE VIRTUES AND VICES COMMON TO SAVAGE NATIONS THE EUROPEANS HAVING DISPERSED THE INDIAN TRIBES AND DRIVEN THEM INTO THE DESERTS CONDEMNED THEM TO A WANDERING LIFE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE SUFFERINGS
THEN I AM INCLINED ONLY TO PERCEIVE BARBARIAN HABITS AND THE OPINIONS OF SAVAGES IN WHAT WE STYLE FEUDAL PRINCIPLES
WE MAY WELL THINK IT AN UNCOMMON MEMORY THAT CAN RECITE WHOLE POEMS FROM BYRON BURNS TENNYSON LONGFELLOW WHITTIER AND LOWELL THE REASON OF THIS MAY BE FOUND PERHAPS
AND NUMBERS OF PUNCH LYING ON THE FLOOR WELL
THE NAME GIVEN TO ITS MOST SOUTHERN EXTREMITY DRAINS A LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST SOURCE OF THE TANGANIKA IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE MOST IMPORTANT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT MYSELF
AND THE EFFORT TO GNAW AT THE CORN EARS HAD LOOSENED ALL HIS TEETH I PREFERRED THE CORN SCONES OF VIRGINIA WHICH TO MY MIND WERE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PALATABLE BREAD OBTAINABLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
HAS BEEN ENJOYING HERSELF IN A YACHT WITH SIR PARAFFINE YOUNG AND HIS FAMILY SIR RODERICK ALSO IS WELL AND EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HE WILL SOON SEE ME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME QUITE A BUDGET
FOR IT IS NOTORIOUS THAT THE DOCTOR HAS A FUND OF QUIET HUMOUR WHICH HE EXHIBITS AT ALL TIMES WHENEVER HE IS AMONG FRIENDS I MUST ALSO BEG LEAVE TO CORRECT THE GENTLEMAN WHO INFORMED ME THAT LIVINGSTONE TAKES NO NOTES OR OBSERVATIONS
IT TOOK HIM FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER TO MARCH TO UJIJI NOW IN SEPTEMBER I BROKE LOOSE FROM THE THRALDOM WHICH ACCIDENT HAD IMPOSED ON ME AND HURRIED SOUTHWARD TO UKONONGO
HIS PRIVATIONS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH NOW WERE POURED INTO MY EAR VERILY DID I BEGIN TO PERCEIVE THAT THE GODS ABOVE DO WITH JUST EYES SURVEY THE AFFAIRS OF MEN
MUCH THOUGHT WELL IF I WERE YOU DOCTOR BEFORE LEAVING UJIJI I SHOULD EXPLORE IT AND RESOLVE THE DOUBTS UPON THE SUBJECT LEST AFTER YOU LEAVE HERE YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN BY THIS WAY
AS I WAS LED TO BELIEVE HE EXHIBITED CONSIDERABLE EMOTION DESPITE THE MONOSYLLABIC GREETING WHEN HE SHOOK MY HAND IF HE WERE A MAN TO FEEL ANNOYANCE AT ANY PERSON COMING AFTER HIM HE WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED ME AS HE DID
IT WAS SUCH A LAUGH AS HERR TEUFELSDROCKH'S A LAUGH OF THE WHOLE MAN FROM HEAD TO HEEL IF HE TOLD A STORY HE RELATED IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE ONE OF ITS TRUTHFULNESS HIS FACE WAS SO
I THOUGHT YOU AT FIRST AN EMISSARY OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
THEN WESTWARD TO KAWENDI THEN NORTHWARD TO UVINZA THEN WESTWARD TO UJIJI ONLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE DOCTOR'S ARRIVAL TO FIND HIM RESTING UNDER THE VERANDA OF HIS HOUSE
THAT CALLED FORTH ALL MY ENTHUSIASM THAT EVOKED NOTHING BUT SINCEREST ADMIRATION DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OLD THOUGH AFTER HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
RELIGION HAS TAMED HIM AND MADE HIM A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN THE CRUDE AND WILFUL HAVE BEEN REFINED AND SUBDUED RELIGION HAS MADE HIM THE MOST COMPANIONABLE OF MEN
AND WALKED OUT TO THE VERANDA HALLOA DOCTOR YOU UP ALREADY I HOPE YOU HAVE SLEPT WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER STANLEY
THE MAN WAS NOT AN APPARITION THEN AND YESTERDAY'S SCENES WERE NOT THE RESULT OF A DREAM AND I GAZED ON HIM INTENTLY FOR THUS I WAS ASSURED HE HAD NOT RUN AWAY
SIR RODERICK MURCHISON TO THE STERN DICTATES OF DUTY ALONE HAS HE SACRIFICED HIS HOME AND EASE THE PLEASURES REFINEMENTS AND LUXURIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE HIS IS THE SPARTAN HEROISM
BUT THEY WERE NECESSARY TO THE DOCTOR WHO HAD NEARLY LOST ALL HIS TEETH FROM THE HARD FARE OF LUNDA HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SUBSIST ON GREEN EARS OF INDIAN CORN THERE WAS NO MEAT IN THAT DISTRICT
WHICH SOMETIMES IS TROUBLESOME IF NOT IMPERTINENT IN HIM RELIGION EXHIBITS ITS LOVELIEST FEATURES IT GOVERNS HIS CONDUCT NOT ONLY TOWARDS HIS SERVANTS BUT TOWARDS THE NATIVES
WHENEVER YOU ARE I AM AT YOUR COMMAND DON'T YOU HEAR MY MEN CALL YOU THE GREAT MASTER AND ME THE LITTLE MASTER IT WOULD NEVER DO FOR THE LITTLE MASTER TO COMMAND BY THIS TIME
MY ELDEST SON HAS MET WITH A SAD ACCIDENT THAT IS MY BOY TOM MY SECOND SON OSWELL IS AT COLLEGE STUDYING MEDICINE AND IS DOING WELL I AM TOLD AGNES MY ELDEST DAUGHTER
HIS FORM WHICH SOON ASSUMED A STOUTISH APPEARANCE IS A LITTLE OVER THE ORDINARY HEIGHT WITH THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE BOW IN THE SHOULDERS WHEN WALKING HE HAS A FIRM BUT HEAVY TREAD LIKE THAT OF AN OVERWORKED OR FATIGUED MAN
I LAY QUIETLY IN BED BED YES IT WAS A PRIMITIVE FOUR POSTER WITH THE LEAVES OF THE PALM TREE SPREAD UPON IT INSTEAD OF DOWN
BEG TO DIFFER WITH ALL AND EACH OF THE ABOVE STATEMENTS I GRANT HE IS NOT AN ANGEL BUT HE APPROACHES TO THAT BEING AS NEAR AS THE NATURE OF A LIVING MAN WILL ALLOW I NEVER SAW ANY SPLEEN OR MISANTHROPY IN HIM
FAMILIAR READINGS IDEAS AND ASSOCIATIONS SO THAT WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE OR BY WHATSOEVER HE WAS SURROUNDED HIS OWN WORLD ALWAYS POSSESSED MORE ATTRACTIONS TO HIS CULTURED MIND
AND REDUCING TO NIL THE FRUITS OF LONG YEARS OF LABOR BY SHARPLY POINTED SHAFTS OF RIDICULE AND SNEERS
AND I WOULD CHALLENGE ANY MAN TO FIND A FAULT IN IT HE IS SENSITIVE I KNOW BUT SO IS ANY MAN OF A HIGH MIND AND GENEROUS NATURE HE IS SENSITIVE ON THE POINT OF BEING DOUBTED OR BEING CRITICISED AN EXTREME LOVE OF TRUTH IS ONE OF HIS STRONGEST CHARACTERISTICS
WHY NOT I HAVE COME HERE TO DO HIM A SERVICE HE HAS NO GOODS I HAVE HE HAS NO MEN WITH HIM I HAVE IF I DO A FRIENDLY PART BY HIM
YOU MAY COMMAND ME FREELY I DRESSED MYSELF QUIETLY INTENDING TO TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE TANGANIKA BEFORE THE DOCTOR SHOULD RISE OPENED THE DOOR WHICH CREAKED HORRIBLY ON ITS HINGES
THE HEAVY STEP WHICH TOLD OF AGE AND HARD TRAVEL THE GREY BEARD AND BOWED SHOULDERS BELIED THE MAN UNDERNEATH THAT WELL WORN EXTERIOR LAY AN ENDLESS FUND OF HIGH SPIRITS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE HUMOUR
LIT UP BY THE SLY FUN IT CONTAINED THAT I WAS SURE THE STORY WAS WORTH RELATING AND WORTH LISTENING TO
AFTER ME YES HOW WELL YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE NEW YORK HERALD OH WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF THAT NEWSPAPER
WITNESSED HIS CONDUCT IN THE CAMP AND ON THE MARCH AND MY FEELINGS FOR HIM ARE THOSE OF UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
NO HARASSING ANXIETIES DISTRACTION OF MIND LONG SEPARATION FROM HOME AND KINDRED CAN MAKE HIM COMPLAIN HE THINKS ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT AT LAST HE HAS SUCH FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF PROVIDENCE
AS FOR BEING GARRULOUS DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS QUITE THE REVERSE HE IS RESERVED IF ANYTHING AND TO THE MAN WHO SAYS DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE IS CHANGED ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE KNOWN HIM
BUT IT IS A CONSTANT EARNEST SINCERE PRACTICE IT IS NEITHER DEMONSTRATIVE NOR LOUD BUT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A QUIET PRACTICAL WAY AND IS ALWAYS AT WORK IT IS NOT AGGRESSIVE
UTTERLY REGARDLESS OF THE LABOR EXPENDED IN OBTAINING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION IN A NEW LAND ENVIRONED BY INCONCEIVABLE DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS CENTRAL AFRICA PRESENTS THEY SEEM TO TAKE DELIGHT IN RENDING TO TATTERS
SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS AFTERWARDS PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND MYSELF AT UJIJI BUT LIVINGSTONE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THERE THEN HE WAS ON THE LUALABA
THAT RUGGED FRAME OF HIS ENCLOSED A YOUNG AND MOST EXUBERANT SOUL EVERY DAY I HEARD INNUMERABLE JOKES AND PLEASANT ANECDOTES INTERESTING HUNTING STORIES IN WHICH HIS FRIENDS OSWELL WEBB VARDON AND GORDEN CUMMING
THAT HAS DETAINED HIM SO LONG IN AFRICA DOING HIS UTMOST TO TEST THE VALUE OF THE MAIN THEORY WHICH CLUNG TO HIM AND WOULD CLING TO HIM UNTIL HE PROVED OR DISPROVED IT THIS MAIN THEORY
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF CURIOSITY UPON THE SUBJECT AND SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCOMPANY YOU I HAVE WITH ME ABOUT TWENTY MEN WHO UNDERSTAND ROWING WE HAVE PLENTY OF GUNS CLOTH AND BEADS AND IF WE CAN GET A CANOE FROM THE ARABS WE CAN MANAGE THE THING EASILY
I SHALL TELL HIM THIS MORNING WHO SENT ME AND WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE I WILL THEN ASK HIM TO WRITE A LETTER TO MISTER BENNETT AND TO GIVE WHAT NEWS HE CAN SPARE I DID NOT COME HERE TO ROB HIM OF HIS NEWS
AND HIS ENTIRE LABOR OF YEARS WERE IN VAIN IF THEORY CAN BE TAKEN IN EVIDENCE AGAINST PERSONAL OBSERVATION AND PATIENT INVESTIGATION THE RELUCTANCE HE MANIFESTS TO ENTERTAIN SUPPOSITIONS
SUFFICIENT FOR ME IS IT THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM IT IS A COMPLETE SUCCESS SO FAR BUT IT WILL BE A GREATER ONE IF HE GIVES ME LETTERS FOR MISTER BENNETT AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HE HAS SEEN ME DO YOU THINK HE WILL DO SO
HE CERTAINLY DEMANDS WHEN ARGUMENTS IN CONTRA ARE USED IN OPPOSITION TO HIM HIGHER AUTHORITY THAN ABSTRACT THEORY HIS WHOLE LIFE IS A TESTIMONY AGAINST ITS UNRELIABILITY
TO BE JUST WHAT I SAY HE IS HE IS AN ARDENT GENEROUS AND TRUE MAN WELL INDEED I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND IT MAKES ME FEEL PROUD TO THINK THAT YOU AMERICANS THINK SO MUCH OF ME
AND THAT THERE ARE ALABAMA CLAIMS LEFT UNSETTLED AND THAT WE HAVE SUCH PEOPLE AS FENIANS IN AMERICA WHO HATE YOU BUT SERIOUSLY DOCTOR NOW DON'T BE FRIGHTENED WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE COME AFTER YOU
IS DETERRED FROM BESTIRRING HIMSELF TO PROVE THEM BY THE TEST OF EXPLORATION HIS OPINION OF SUCH A MAN IS THAT HE UNFITS HIMSELF FOR HIS DUTY
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK THERE IS SHEET AFTER SHEET COLUMN AFTER COLUMN CAREFULLY WRITTEN OF FIGURES ALONE A LARGE LETTER WHICH I RECEIVED FROM HIM HAS BEEN SENT TO SIR THOMAS MAC LEAR AND THIS CONTAINS NOTHING BUT OBSERVATIONS
THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE ROMAN THE ENDURING RESOLUTION OF THE ANGLO SAXON NEVER TO RELINQUISH HIS WORK THOUGH HIS HEART YEARNS FOR HOME NEVER TO SURRENDER HIS OBLIGATIONS UNTIL HE CAN WRITE
MY COMPANION WAS IMPROVING IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS LIFE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO HIM HIS FADING VITALITY WAS RESTORED HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR HIS WORK WAS GROWING UP AGAIN INTO A HEIGHT THAT WAS COMPELLING HIM TO DESIRE TO BE UP AND DOING
TO HAVE BEEN PAINSTAKING AND AS EXACT AS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ALLOW ORDINARY CRITICS SELDOM TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CIRCUMSTANCES BUT
AS THEY DID BOTH BURTON AND SPEKE AND I HAD NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CLOTH IF I HAD GONE TO THE HEAD OF THE TANGANIKA I COULD NOT HAVE GONE TO MANYUEMA THE CENTRAL LINE OF DRAINAGE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THAT HE IS VERY LIKELY TO BECOME A SLAVE TO THEORY A VOLUPTUOUS FANCY WHICH WOULD MASTER HIM IT IS HIS FIRM BELIEF THAT A MAN WHO RESTS HIS SOLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF AFRICA ON THEORY
HIS GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THIS ARE OF SUCH NATURE AND WEIGHT AS TO COMPEL HIM TO DESPISE THE WARNING THAT YEARS ARE ADVANCING ON HIM AND HIS FORMER IRON CONSTITUTION IS FAILING
IF NOT YOUR TIME IS LOST AND YOU WILL ONLY ANNOY ME I SHALL SEEM TO YOU STUPID AND THE REPUTATION I HAVE FALSE ALL MY GOOD IS MAGNETIC AND I EDUCATE NOT BY LESSONS
I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT LIVINGSTONE POSSESSED A SPLENETIC MISANTHROPIC TEMPER SOME HAVE SAID THAT HE IS GARRULOUS THAT HE IS DEMENTED THAT HE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED FROM THE DAVID LIVINGSTONE WHOM PEOPLE KNEW AS THE REVEREND MISSIONARY
HIS MAPS ALSO EVINCE GREAT CARE AND INDUSTRY AS TO THE REPORT OF HIS AFRICAN MARRIAGE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MORE THAN THAT IT IS UNTRUE AND IT IS UTTERLY BENEATH A GENTLEMAN
THE DOCTOR SAID HE HAD THOUGHT ME A MOST LUXURIOUS AND RICH MAN WHEN HE SAW MY GREAT BATH TUB CARRIED ON THE SHOULDERS OF ONE OF MY MEN BUT HE THOUGHT ME STILL MORE LUXURIOUS THIS MORNING WHEN MY KNIVES AND FORKS
I HAD DISCOVERED LIVINGSTONE AND I WAS IN HIS HOUSE I LISTENED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DAWNING ON ME MIGHT BE CONFIRMED BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE I HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SULLEN ROAR OF THE SURF
HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO WEAR A NAVAL CAP WITH A SEMICIRCULAR PEAK BY WHICH HE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGHOUT AFRICA HIS DRESS WHEN FIRST I SAW HIM EXHIBITED TRACES OF PATCHING AND REPAIRING BUT WAS SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
THE HUGE LETTS'S DIARY WHICH I CARRIED HOME TO HIS DAUGHTER IS FULL OF NOTES AND THERE ARE NO LESS THAN A SCORE OF SHEETS WITHIN IT FILLED WITH OBSERVATIONS WHICH HE TOOK DURING THE LAST TRIP HE MADE TO MANYUEMA ALONE
IF HE IS FLIGHTY OR WRONG HEADED HE IS SURE TO DEVELOP HIS HOBBIES AND WEAK SIDE I THINK IT POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT LIVINGSTONE WITH AN UNSUITABLE COMPANION MIGHT FEEL ANNOYANCE I KNOW I SHOULD DO SO VERY READILY
I AM OBLIGED TO THINK THEM NATURAL ANOTHER THING WHICH SPECIALLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WAS HIS WONDERFULLY RETENTIVE MEMORY IF WE REMEMBER THE MANY YEARS HE HAS SPENT IN AFRICA DEPRIVED OF BOOKS
LOOK HERE SAID THE YOUNG FELLOW DESPERATELY YOU SIMPLY MUST LET ME DO SOMETHING BY WAY OF REPARATION I REFUSED SWEETLY BUT AS HE PERSISTED I LET HIM HAVE MY ADDRESS
I FORGOT YOU DO TAKE MILK DON'T YOU WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE HOT WATER IF IT'S TOO STRONG CUSHAT PRINKLY HAD READ OF SUCH THINGS IN SCORES OF NOVELS
JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS HAD A SETTLED CONVICTION THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS HE WOULD MARRY UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FOUR HE HAD DONE NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THAT CONVICTION
AND INSIDE SHALL BE A BASKET OF PLOVER EGGS OF WHICH THE PRINCE IS SO FOND AND HE SHALL GIVE IT TO HIS HIGHNESS AS EASTER OFFERING IT IS SO PRETTY AN IDEA WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE ONCE IN STYRIA
NEARER AND NEARER TO THE GROUP THAT WAITED SHEEP LIKE TO RECEIVE HIM A FASCINATED CURIOSITY COMPELLED LESTER TO TURN HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE FUGITIVES
I'M SO AWFULLY SORRY SAID THE YOUNG MAN I KEEP DOGS MYSELF SO I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST FEEL ABOUT IT I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN IN REPARATION
BUT WHEN THE BURGOMASTER HEARD OF IT HE WAS ENCHANTED THE COMBINATION OF SENTIMENT AND PLOVERS EGGS APPEALED STRONGLY TO HIS TEUTONIC MIND
POVERTY KEEPS TOGETHER MORE HOMES THAN IT BREAKS UP BUT WE ALWAYS HUNTED WITH DIFFERENT PACKS ALL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY WE HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THE MEET YET I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A MEET
BUT THE BURGOMASTER HOPED THAT THE RESOURCEFUL ENGLISH LADY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND TASTEFUL TO SUGGEST IN THE WAY OF LOYAL GREETING THE PRINCE WAS KNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IF AT ALL AS AN OLD FASHIONED REACTIONARY
INCIDENTALLY TOO I LOST THE FRIENDSHIP OF CONSTANCE BRODDLE YOU SEE WHEN I SOLD THE BROOCH I QUITE PROPERLY REFUSED TO GIVE HER ANY SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS
BUT I FEEL SURE THE SAME IDEA HAS OCCURRED TO THEM OF COURSE WITH GOODWOOD ON US I AM RATHER RUSHED JUST NOW BUT IN MY BUSINESS WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT WE LIVE IN A SERIES OF RUSHES LIKE THE INFANT MOSES
OF COURSE WE KEPT OUR OWN COUNSEL AS TO THE EARLIER EPISODES OF THE EVENING LORD PABHAM NEVER ADVERTISED THE LOSS OF HIS HYAENA WHEN A STRICTLY FRUIT EATING ANIMAL STRAYED FROM HIS PARK A YEAR OR TWO PREVIOUSLY
PURSUED THE WOMAN BUT HE WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND DO AS HE IS TOLD
AND A DRONE OF LUGUBRIOUS MUSIC FLOATING IN OUR EARS
ALSO SHE SAW HER SON LYING PRONE IN AN AGONY OF OVERMASTERING TERROR HIS SPASM OF DARING SHATTERED BY THE CHILD'S UNEXPECTED RESISTANCE STILL CLUTCHING FRANTICALLY AS THOUGH FOR SAFETY
RHODA WELCOMED HIM INTO A ROOM THAT SEEMED TO DO DUTY AS WORKSHOP SITTING ROOM AND KITCHEN COMBINED AND TO BE WONDERFULLY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AT THE SAME TIME I'M HAVING A PICNIC MEAL
SAID THE HUSBAND THE SMALL CHILD AND LADY BARBARA SEEMED EQUALLY UNENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PRETTY IDEA LESTER WAS OPENLY DISCOURAGING
FOR WE LOST THE HOUNDS AND FOUND OURSELVES PLODDING AIMLESSLY ALONG MILES AWAY FROM ANYWHERE IT WAS FAIRLY EXASPERATING AND MY TEMPER WAS BEGINNING TO LET ITSELF GO BY INCHES
BEHIND WHICH HER VOICE WOULD TINKLE PLEASANTLY IN A SERIES OF LITTLE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS ABOUT WEAK OR STRONG TEA HOW MUCH IF ANY SUGAR MILK CREAM AND SO FORTH IS IT ONE LUMP
THAT HER SON SHOULD BE SO UNDISGUISEDLY A COWARD WHATEVER GOOD QUALITIES LESTER SLAGGBY MAY HAVE POSSESSED AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CHARMING COURAGE COULD CERTAINLY NEVER BE IMPUTED TO HIM
AN UPLAND TOWNSHIP IN ONE OF THOSE SMALL PRINCEDOMS THAT MAKE INCONSPICUOUS FRECKLES ON THE MAP OF CENTRAL EUROPE A LONG STANDING ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE REIGNING FAMILY
JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY OBSTINATE OR INDIFFERENT TO HOME INFLUENCES TO DISREGARD THE OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED WISH OF HIS FAMILY THAT HE SHOULD BECOME ENAMOURED OF SOME NICE MARRIAGEABLE GIRL
HE STOOPED AND CLUTCHED AT THE EASTER EGG AS ONE TRIES TO SCOOP UP THE BALL IN RUGBY FOOTBALL WHAT HE MEANT TO DO WITH IT HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE THING WAS TO GET IT
IT'S A HYAENA I CRIED IT MUST HAVE ESCAPED FROM LORD PABHAM'S PARK AT THAT MOMENT THE HUNTED BEAST TURNED AND FACED ITS PURSUERS AND THE HOUNDS THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT SIX COUPLE OF THEM
HE LIKED AND ADMIRED A GREAT MANY WOMEN COLLECTIVELY AND DISPASSIONATELY WITHOUT SINGLING OUT ONE FOR ESPECIAL MATRIMONIAL CONSIDERATION
WHEN THE BEAST JOINED US AGAIN AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A FEW MINUTES THERE WAS AN AIR OF PATIENT UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING OF WHICH WE DISAPPROVED BUT WHICH HE FELT TO BE THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIABLE
SHE ANNOUNCED THERE'S CAVIARE IN THAT JAR AT YOUR ELBOW BEGIN ON THAT BROWN BREAD AND BUTTER WHILE I CUT SOME MORE FIND YOURSELF A CUP THE TEAPOT IS BEHIND YOU NOW TELL ME ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THINGS
AND EVENTUAL DOMESTICITY IT WAS NECESSARY HOWEVER TO ASK THE LADY WHAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER THE FAMILY HAD SO FAR CONDUCTED AND DIRECTED THE FLIRTATION WITH ABILITY AND DISCRETION
THEN SHRANK BACK IN RECOIL AS HE SHRIEKED OUT ONE HIDEOUS WORD LADY BARBARA HEARD THE WORD AND SAW THE CROWD RACE AWAY LIKE SCATTERED SHEEP SAW THE PRINCE FORCIBLY HUSTLED AWAY BY HIS ATTENDANTS
A CLEAR WORKING MAJORITY OF HIS FEMALE RELATIVES AND THE AFORESAID MATRONLY FRIENDS HAD PITCHED ON JOAN SEBASTABLE AS THE MOST SUITABLE YOUNG WOMAN IN HIS RANGE OF ACQUAINTANCE TO WHOM HE MIGHT PROPOSE MARRIAGE
THE INDICATIONS WERE ALL THAT WAY I SAID ON THE OTHER HAND OF COURSE IT MAY HAVE BEEN CRYING FROM SHEER TEMPER CHILDREN SOMETIMES DO IT WAS NEARLY PITCH DARK WHEN WE EMERGED SUDDENLY INTO THE HIGHROAD
AS THEY APPROACHED NEARER TO THE PRINCELY DAIS LADY BARBARA STOOD DISCREETLY ASIDE AND THE STOLID FACED INFANT WALKED FORWARD ALONE WITH STAGGERING BUT STEADFAST GAIT
AND IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER ABOUT DIVANS AND NUBIAN PAGES SHE WOULD HAVE URGED HIM TO TAKE A WEEK'S HOLIDAY AT THE SEASIDE
AND A SHARP SCREECHING YELL FOLLOWED A SECOND LATER THE CAR DREW UP AND WHEN I HAD RIDDEN BACK TO THE SPOT I FOUND A YOUNG MAN BENDING OVER A DARK MOTIONLESS MASS LYING BY THE ROADSIDE YOU HAVE KILLED MY ESME I
THE CHILD MARCHING STOLIDLY AND WITH GRIM DETERMINATION AT HER SIDE IT HAD BEEN PROMISED CAKES AND SWEETIES GALORE IF IT GAVE THE EGG WELL AND TRULY TO THE KIND OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WAITING TO RECEIVE IT
WHO HAD LAGGED SOMEWHAT BEHIND WITH A FEW SPRINGY BOUNDS HE DREW UP LEVEL AND THEN SHOT PAST US THE WAILING ACCOMPANIMENT WAS EXPLAINED THE GIPSY CHILD WAS FIRMLY AND I EXPECT PAINFULLY
PLEASE BURY HIM AT ONCE I SAID THAT MUCH I THINK I MAY ASK OF YOU BRING THE SPADE WILLIAM HE CALLED TO THE CHAUFFEUR EVIDENTLY HASTY ROADSIDE INTERMENTS WERE CONTINGENCIES THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED AGAINST
IF YOU'LL FORGET GOODWOOD FOR A MOMENT AND LISTEN TO ME I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SOME FORTY MINUTES LATER JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY RETURNED TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY BEARING AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF NEWS
SHE MADE NO OTHER ALLUSION TO FOOD BUT TALKED AMUSINGLY AND MADE HER VISITOR TALK AMUSINGLY TOO AT THE SAME TIME SHE CUT THE BREAD AND BUTTER WITH A MASTERLY SKILL
REGARDED HIS DILATORY APPROACH TO THE MARRIED STATE WITH A DISAPPROVAL THAT WAS FAR FROM BEING INARTICULATE HIS MOST INNOCENT FLIRTATIONS WERE WATCHED WITH THE STRAINING EAGERNESS WHICH A GROUP OF UNEXERCISED TERRIERS
YOU AROUSE NOT MERELY MY CURIOSITY BUT MY BUSINESS INSTINCTS I HOPE YOU'VE COME ABOUT HATS I HEARD THAT YOU HAD COME INTO A LEGACY THE OTHER DAY
THE MOTHER WAS UNOBTRUSIVE AND LESS FUSSY THAN MOST PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ASKED A SALLOW HIGH CHEEK BONED LADY TO WHOM THE ENGLISHWOMAN HAD SPOKEN ONCE OR TWICE AND WHOM SHE HAD SET DOWN IN HER MIND AS PROBABLY A SOUTHERN SLAV MIGHT I SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR THE RECEPTION FEST
I DIDN'T COME ABOUT HATS SAID HER VISITOR IN FACT I DON'T THINK I REALLY CAME ABOUT ANYTHING I WAS PASSING AND I JUST THOUGHT I'D LOOK IN AND SEE YOU SINCE I'VE BEEN SITTING TALKING TO YOU HOWEVER
THE SHARPENED INSTINCT OF COWARDICE LIT UP THE SITUATION TO HIM IN ONE SWIFT FLASH THE BLOOD ROARED AND SURGED TO HIS HEAD AS THOUGH THOUSANDS OF FLOODGATES HAD BEEN OPENED IN HIS VEINS AND ARTERIES
LESTER HAD TRIED TO CONVEY TO IT PRIVATELY THAT HORRIBLE SMACKINGS WOULD ATTEND ANY FAILURE IN ITS SHARE OF THE PROCEEDINGS BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HIS GERMAN CAUSED MORE THAN AN IMMEDIATE DISTRESS
I HURLED MY SANDWICH CASE AT THE BRUTE IN FACT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD HAVE DONE AND STILL WE LUMBERED ON THROUGH THE DEEPENING DUSK WITH THAT DARK UNCOUTH SHAPE LUMBERING AHEAD OF US
WE RODE ON HOPEFULLY BUT UNEVENTFULLY FOR ANOTHER MILE OR SO I WONDER WHAT THAT CHILD WAS DOING THERE SAID CONSTANCE PRESENTLY PICKING BLACKBERRIES OBVIOUSLY
WHAT DOES ONE GENERALLY DO WITH HYAENAS I ASKED CROSSLY I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ONE BEFORE SAID CONSTANCE WELL NEITHER HAVE I IF WE EVEN KNEW ITS SEX WE MIGHT GIVE IT A NAME
THAT WOULD DO IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT FOR US TO DISTINGUISH WAYSIDE OBJECTS AND OUR LISTLESS SPIRITS GAVE AN UPWARD PERK AS WE CAME UPON A SMALL HALF NAKED GIPSY BRAT
AND OF COURSE IT STRUCK ME THAT IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL AND DESIRABLE THING FOR YOU TO CELEBRATE THE EVENT BY BUYING BRILLIANTLY EXPENSIVE HATS FOR ALL YOUR SISTERS THEY MAY NOT HAVE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
I'M ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED HE ANNOUNCED A RAPTUROUS OUTBREAK OF CONGRATULATION AND SELF APPLAUSE BROKE OUT AH WE KNEW
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE I DOUBT IF HE'S RAVENING AT THE PRESENT MOMENT CONSTANCE SHUDDERED DO YOU THINK THE POOR LITTLE THING SUFFERED MUCH CAME ANOTHER OF HER FUTILE QUESTIONS
AROUSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPATIENCE AMONG THE SENTIMENTALLY MINDED WOMEN FOLK OF HIS HOME CIRCLE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTERS AN AUNT IN RESIDENCE AND TWO OR THREE INTIMATE MATRONLY FRIENDS
AND THE BOY LIMP AND ALREADY NEARLY DEAD WITH A TERROR THAT ALMOST STIFLED HIS SCREAMS AND OVER THEM THE LONG GALA STREAMERS FLAPPING GAILY IN THE SUNSHINE
SHE WENT ON WITH A CERTAIN SHY EAGERNESS OUR LITTLE CHILD HERE OUR BABY WE WILL DRESS HIM IN LITTLE WHITE COAT WITH SMALL WINGS AS AN EASTER ANGEL AND HE WILL CARRY A LARGE WHITE EASTER EGG
THE CAB HAD STARTED AT HOT PACE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STATION THE NEXT MOMENT LESTER WAS RUNNING RUNNING FASTER THAN ANY OF THOSE PRESENT HAD EVER SEEN A MAN RUN AND
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T SAID CUSHAT PRINKLY IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME AT LUNCH TIME TO DAY THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK RHODA ELLAM TO MARRY ME AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ACCEPT ME I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
MERELY STIPULATING THAT SHE SHOULD PLACE THE EASTER EGG HERSELF IN THE ARMS THAT HAD BEEN CAREFULLY SCHOOLED HOW TO HOLD THE PRECIOUS BURDEN THEN LADY BARBARA MOVED FORWARD
THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY WAS CARRIED ON MORE BY THE FORCE OF SUGGESTION AND THE WEIGHT OF PUBLIC OPINION THAN BY ANY INITIATIVE OF HIS OWN
LESTER SANK TO HIS KNEES TUGGING SAVAGELY AT THE TIGHTLY CLASPED BURDEN AND ANGRY CRIES ROSE FROM THE SCANDALIZED ONLOOKERS A QUESTIONING THREATENING RING FORMED ROUND HIM
IN HIS MIND'S EYE IT WAS AN ISLAND IN PERPETUAL HALF MOURNING WITH BLACK OR WHITE MINORCA HENS RUNNING ALL OVER IT PROBABLY IT WOULD NOT BE A BIT LIKE THAT WHEN ONE CAME TO EXAMINE IT
AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE FIRST FLIGHT THOUGH IT WAS A FAIRLY STIFF RUN
PERSONALLY I WAS DOING EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED TO ME AT THE MOMENT I STORMED AND SCOLDED AND COAXED IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH AND GAMEKEEPER LANGUAGE I MADE ABSURD INEFFECTUAL CUTS IN THE AIR WITH MY THONGLESS HUNTING CROP
PICKING BLACKBERRIES FROM A LOW GROWING BUSH THE SUDDEN APPARITION OF TWO HORSEWOMEN AND A HYAENA SET IT OFF CRYING AND IN ANY CASE WE SHOULD SCARCELY HAVE GLEANED ANY USEFUL GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FROM THAT SOURCE
WHO MADE A LIVING BY CREATING HATS OUT OF COSTLY MATERIALS THE HATS REALLY LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD COME FROM PARIS THE CHEQUES SHE GOT FOR THEM UNFORTUNATELY NEVER LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO PARIS
AND HIS TASTES HAD SOME CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED ON A SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON OF THE SAME YEAR AFTER THE HONEYMOON IN MINORCA HAD ENDED
STOOD ROUND IN A HALF CIRCLE AND LOOKED FOOLISH EVIDENTLY THEY HAD BROKEN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE PACK ON THE TRAIL OF THIS ALIEN SCENT AND WERE NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO TREAT THEIR QUARRY NOW THEY HAD GOT HIM
WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR
SHE GOT UP TO HER FEET UNSTEADILY AND SWAYED TOWARD HIM IN A SECOND HE WAS BY HER SIDE HIS ARMS ABOUT HER SHE MADE NO RESISTANCE BUT RATHER HE FELT A YIELDING TOWARDS HIM WHICH HE HAD MISSED BEFORE HER PALE FACE WAS UPTURNED TO HIS AND HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER
HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
HEAT THEM IN THE SOUP AND SERVE TIME
WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
THE CONFESSION OF ODETTE RIDER HE COULD ONLY GAZE IN STUPIFIED SILENCE YOU HE SAID WONDERINGLY THE GIRL WAS PALE AND HER EYES NEVER LEFT HIS FACE SHE NODDED YES IT IS I SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE
THE PRICKLY STAR CREEPS ON WITH FULL DECEIT TO FORCE THE OYSTER FROM HIS CLOSE RETREAT WHEN GAPING LIDS THEIR WIDEN'D VOID DISPLAY THE WATCHFUL STAR THRUSTS IN A POINTED RAY OF ALL ITS TREASURES SPOILS THE RIFLED CASE
FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
BUT DO NOT LET IT BOIL AND SERVE VERY HOT TIME THREE QUARTERS HOUR AVERAGE COST
I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD OH I'M NOT HURT SHE SAID WEARILY
MIX THE FLOUR SMOOTHLY TO A BATTER WITH THE CREAM BRING IT TO A BOIL POUR OVER THE EELS AND SERVE TIME
WAS THE SECOND SHOCK OF THE EVENING IT WAS AS THOUGH SHE HAD KNOWN IT ALL ALONG HE WAS ON HIS KNEES BY HER SIDE AND HIS ARM WAS ABOUT HER SHOULDERS EVEN BEFORE HIS BRAIN HAD WILLED THE ACT MY GIRL MY GIRL HE SAID GENTLY WON'T YOU PLEASE TELL ME
SHE LOOKED UP AT HIS WORDS I ON THE BICYCLE SHE ASKED NO IT WAS NOT I NOT YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD I WAS IN THE GROUNDS
WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
ODETTE ODETTE HE WHISPERED DON'T YOU REALISE THAT I LOVE YOU AND WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO SAVE YOU FROM UNHAPPINESS WON'T YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING PLEASE NO NO NO SHE MURMURED WITH A LITTLE CATCH IN HER VOICE PLEASE DON'T ASK ME
PRAWN SOUP
LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU MEAN HE HESITATED THE MURDER OF THORNTON LYNE I KNOW NOTHING OF THAT SHE MADE NO RESPONSE TO THAT TENDER ARM OF HIS BUT SAT RIGID SOMETHING IN HER ATTITUDE CHILLED HIM
MODE BEARD THE OYSTERS AND SCALD THEM IN THEIR OWN LIQUOR THEN ADD IT WELL STRAINED TO THE BROTH THICKEN WITH THE BUTTER AND FLOUR AND SIMMER FOR ONE QUARTER OF AN HOUR PUT IN THE OYSTERS STIR WELL
THE CATCHES SNAPPED OPEN AND HE THREW BACK THE FLAP THEN A HAND SNATCHED THE PORTFOLIO FROM HIM AND HE TURNED TO SEE THE GIRL'S QUIVERING FACE AND READ THE TERROR IN HER EYES NO NO SHE CRIED ALMOST BESIDE HERSELF NO FOR GOD'S SAKE NO
THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
A LITTLE NUTMEG ONE TEASPOONFUL OF FLOUR ONE PINT OF CREAM ONE PINT OF MILK FORCEMEAT BALLS MACE SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE BREAD CRUMBS ONE EGG TWO QUARTS OF WATER MODE
THREE BLADES OF MACE ONE BUNCH OF SWEET HERBS ONE QUARTER OZ OF PEPPERCORNS SALT TO TASTE
BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
AT THE SAME TIME ADDING THE TAILS CUT IN PIECES MAKE THE FORCEMEAT BALLS WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE LOBSTER SEASONED WITH MACE PEPPER AND SALT ADDING A LITTLE FLOUR AND A FEW BREAD CRUMBS MOISTEN THEM WITH THE EGG
LOCKS WILL PRESENT VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY
THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
THIS LITTLE FISH BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE SHRIMP BUT IS NEITHER SO COMMON NOR SO SMALL
AND THE SAME QUANTITY OF WATER STEW THEM FOR ONE QUARTER HOUR AND STRAIN OFF THE LIQUOR PUT THE FISH STOCK OR WATER INTO A STEWPAN ADD THE STRAINED LIQUOR POUND THE PRAWNS WITH THE CRUMB OF A ROLL MOISTENED WITH A LITTLE OF THE SOUP
MODE SHELL THE CRAYFISH AND PUT THE FISH BETWEEN TWO PLATES UNTIL THEY ARE WANTED POUND THE SHELLS IN A MORTAR WITH THE BUTTER AND ANCHOVIES WHEN WELL BEATEN ADD A PINT OF STOCK AND SIMMER FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
PICK THE MEAT FROM THE LOBSTERS
HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
OR SIX SMALL ONES THE CRUMB OF A FRENCH ROLL TWO ANCHOVIES ONE ONION ONE SMALL BUNCH OF SWEET HERBS ONE STRIP OF LEMON PEEL
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
CRAYFISH SOUP
LET THEM SIMMER FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POUR THE WATER TO THEM AND ADD THE ONION CUT IN THIN SLICES THE HERBS MACE AND SEASONING SIMMER TILL THE EELS ARE TENDER BUT DO NOT BREAK THE FISH TAKE THEM OUT CAREFULLY
I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
IF NOT THICK ENOUGH PUT IN A LITTLE BUTTER AND FLOUR TIME
I SAW YOU USING YOUR LAMP AND I WAS QUITE CLOSE TO YOU WHEN YOU PICKED UP THE WALLET SHE SAID LISTLESSLY BUT I WAS NOT ON THE BICYCLE WHO WAS IT HE ASKED SHE SHOOK HER HEAD MAY I HAVE THAT PLEASE
IF MADE WITH WATER SEASONABLE AT ANY TIME SUFFICIENT FOR EIGHT PERSONS NOTE THIS CAN BE THICKENED WITH TOMATOES AND VERMICELLI SERVED IN IT
SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH
TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
RUB THEM THROUGH A TAMMY AND MIX THEM BY DEGREES WITH THE SOUP ADD KETCHUP OR ANCHOVY SAUCE TO TASTE WITH A LITTLE LEMON JUICE WHEN IT IS WELL COOKED PUT IN A FEW PICKED PRAWNS LET THEM GET THOROUGHLY HOT AND SERVE
BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
SHE HELD OUT HER HAND AND HE HESITATED AFTER ALL HE HAD NO RIGHT OR TITLE TO THIS CURIOUS PURSE HE COMPROMISED BY PUTTING IT ON THE TABLE AND SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT ODETTE HE SAID GENTLY AND WALKED ROUND TO HER
AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER
ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
MILBURGH HAD GONE TOO FAR TARLING SAW HIS FACE LENGTHEN AND THE LOOK OF APPREHENSION IN HIS COLD BLUE EYES THEN WITHOUT FURTHER HESITATION HE OPENED THE PAPER AND READ THE FIRST LINE TOOK AWAY HIS BREATH THE CONFESSION OF ODETTE RIDER
AND PULLED FROM HIS POCKET A CHAIN AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A SMALL BUNCH OF KEYS HERE IS THE KEY HE SAID UNLOCK AND READ TO NIGHT TARLING TOOK THE KEY IN HIS HAND INSERTED IT IN FIRST ONE TINY LOCK AND THEN IN THE OTHER
HERE IT WAS THE GIRL'S VOICE SURPRISINGLY CLEAR AND STEADY HER SHAKING HANDS HELD THE PAPER SHE HAD TAKEN FROM THE WALLET AND SHE THRUST IT TOWARD THE DETECTIVE THERE IS A REASON SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
FROM SOME LINES OF OPPIAN IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE ANCIENTS WERE IGNORANT THAT THE OYSTER IS GENERALLY FOUND ADHERING TO ROCKS THE STARFISH IS ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY ENEMIES OF THESE BIVALVES THE POET SAYS
AND THAT YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO GET US SAFELY OUT OF THIS COUNTRY TO ONE WHERE EXTRADITION LAWS CANNOT FOLLOW TARLING TOOK ONE STEP TOWARDS HIM AND MILBURGH SHRANK BACK DO YOU ACCUSE MISS RIDER OF COMPLICITY IN THIS MURDER HE DEMANDED MILBURGH SMILED
OH YES SAID THE DYING GIRL
WERE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND HERE I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A VERY INTERESTING YOUNG AMERICAN PROFESSOR LECTURE THIS MORNING WONDERED WHEN THEY WERE FANNING THEMSELVES IN THE AIRY LECTURE ROOM IF THEY WOULD CARE TO MEET PROFESSOR TENSION
DROP THAT WORK AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT REMEMBER THIS NEVER WILL YOU BE CALLED A DORCAS NEVER WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEW AND PROVIDE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MUST SHOW IT BY YOUR WORKS AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
IN A DIM PARLOR FULL OF MAHOGANY AND ROSE JARS
BROWSING ABOUT AMONG THE COLONIAL HISTORIES AND GENEALOGIES OF THE WESTON PUBLIC LIBRARY YEARS BEFORE HAD COME TO A JUBILANT CERTAINTY THAT MOTHER'S GRANDFATHER MUST HAVE BEEN THE SAME MAN BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL QUITE SO POSITIVE NOW YOUR PEOPLE AREN'T STILL IN THE SOUTH YOU SAID
HOW COUSIN THIS MARRIED A MAN WHOSE PEOPLE AREN'T ANYBODY
SHE'S A FUNNY DEAR OLD LADY YOU KNOW MISS PAGET THE PROFESSOR WENT ON WITH HIS EAGER IMPERSONAL AIR
THEN WITH ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BLIND
THEN SUDDENLY PAULA SHE CALLED PAULA HERE I AM MARGUERITE AND PAULA CAME CLOSER TAKING HER HAND AH YOU ARE HERE THANKS DEAR PAULA SHE GASPED
I DECLARE SAID ROSA THINK OF THE BRETON
MISSUS CRAWFORD SUPPLIED PROMPTLY NOW THE EASTMANS HAVE THREE TOO WITH A TRAINED NURSE APIECE I SEE MARGARET ADMITTED SLOWLY
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PAULA WHEN SHE BEGINS TO SPEAK OF GOD'S LOVE SHE SEEMS TRULY INSPIRED BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT CHILD THOUGH SHE IS SHE SURELY IS HIS MESSENGER TO ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT BUT THERE'S JUST ONE THING
AND TERESA SEEMED TO HESITATE TO EXPRESS HERSELF THEN FINALLY SHE CONTINUED I CANNOT SEEM TO SHAKE OFF THE FEELING THAT SHE WILL NOT BE WITH US MUCH LONGER I BELIEVE SOMEHOW I KNOW IT SOUNDS ABSURD IN ONE WAY
MARGARET SAID VAGUELY UNCOMFORTABLE WELL SHE MUST KNOW AUNT PAMELA SAID JOHN TENISON ENTHUSIASTICALLY I EXPECT THEY'D BE GREAT FRIENDS AND YOU MUST KNOW AUNT PAM SHE'S LIKE A DAINTY OLD PIECE OF CHINA OR A I DON'T KNOW A TEA ROSE
PAULA ALWAYS TOLD HIM BIBLE STORIES FOR THAT SEEMED TO BE HIS CHIEF PLEASURE AND I TAUGHT HIM TO READ
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN TO BEGIN WITH DISTINGUISHED AT THIRTY TWO IN HIS CHOSEN WORK BIG AND WELL BUILT WITHOUT SUGGESTING THE ATHLETE OF AN OLD AND HONORED AMERICAN FAMILY AND THE ONLY SON OF A RICH AND ECCENTRIC OLD DOCTOR
THE BRETON KNOWS VERY WELL THAT WHEN YOUR FATHER GOT RID OF HIM HE WELL DESERVED IT SAID TERESA AS SHE ADJUSTED HER SPECTACLES AND SETTLED DOWN TO HER KNITTING MY FATHER DID NOT KEEP HIM LONG
WHEN THE HAPPY STEADY MURMUR FROM THEIR OWN TABLE SEEMED ECHOED BY THE MURMURS CLINK AND STIR AND LAUGHTER ALL ABOUT THEM AND ACCENTED BY THE NOT TOO CLOSE MUSIC FROM THE BAND DOCTOR TENSION WAS EVERYTHING CHARMING MARGARET THOUGHT INSTANTLY DRAWN BY THE UNAFFECTED FRIENDLY MANNER
AS SHE STARTED TO COME TO MY RESCUE IT'S THE BRETON I SAID
THEN MARGARET WAS TRANSFORMED WITHIN A FEW HOURS FROM A MERELY PRETTY VERY DIGNIFIED PERFECTLY CONTENTED SECRETARY ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE WORE AS LONG AS IT WAS SUITABLE AND FRESH INTO A LIVING WOMAN
ANSWERED WITH HER OWN SMILE PROFESSOR TENSION'S SUDDEN CHARMING ONE LOST HER SMALL HAND IN HIS BIG FIRM ONE THEN SHE LISTENED TO HIM TALK AS HE STRODE ABOUT THE PLATFORM BOYISHLY SHAKING BACK THE HAIR THAT FELL ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AFTER THAT HE WALKED TO THE HOTEL WITH THEM
THE LITTLE OIL LAMP WHICH WE ALWAYS KEPT LIGHTED AT NIGHT IN THE PASSAGEWAY ILLUMINATED HIS PALE FACE AND GAUNT FIGURE GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE HE FINALLY MANAGED TO SAY AND THEN HE STOPPED APPARENTLY AS EMBARRASSED AS I WAS
AND TOOK HER TURN AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN VICTORIA CAME HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE HAPPY YEARS MARGARET DROOPED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME A LONGING FOR MONEY AND POWER OF HER OWN GNAWED AT THE GIRL'S HEART
MABEL WAS A WRECK I'VE SEEN HER TRYING TO PLAY A BRIDGE HAND WITH DOROTHY BOBBING ABOUT ON HER ARM POOR GIRL FINALLY THEY WENT TO A HOTEL AND OF COURSE THE CHILD GOT OLDER AND WAS LESS TROUBLE BUT TO THIS DAY MABEL DOESN'T DARE LEAVE HER ALONE FOR ONE SECOND
SHE'S MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN EVEN I AM AND BESIDES I NEVER NEVER COULD BEAR IT TO HAVE PAULA TAKEN FROM ME HUSH HUSH CHILD DON'T SHOUT THAT WAY
SHE FINISHED DECIDEDLY DO YOU WONDER THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT HAVING CHILDREN AT FIRST NATURALLY ONE DOESN'T WANT THEM FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS I'M SURE THE THOUGHT DOESN'T COME INTO ONE'S HEAD BUT THEN AFTERWARDS YOU SEE I'VE BEEN MARRIED FIFTEEN YEARS NOW
SAID SHE TO MISSUS CRAWFORD LIFE IS MORE COMPLICATED
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW PAULA WOULD SAY SADLY AND WOULD TAKE UP THE WORK ONCE MORE WITH SUCH SWEET RESIGNATION THAT TERESA MOVED WITH COMPASSION
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN AND WHEN ONE HAS SERVED THE DEVIL AS MANY YEARS AS I HAVE
MY HEAD WASN'T IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS I'D LEFT MY WITS BEHIND AT THE LIQUOR SHOP
OR IF YOU'RE OUT FOR LUNCHEON OR GIVING A LUNCHEON SHE BRINGS BABY HOME BUMPS THE CARRIAGE INTO THE BASEMENT
I DESERVED TO BE REFUSED
ONLY MY MARGUERITE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHE BECAME OUR CONSTANT DELIGHT
AND SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COME IN THIS MORNING THANK YOU AND
THERE CAME TWO HESITATING KNOCKS ON THE OUTER DOOR
THE STORM HAD STOPPED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT GOD WILL CALL HER TO HIS SIDE SOME DAY SOON OH TERESA I CRIED HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING
DO YOU SUPPOSE MY GRANDMOTHER EVER TOOK A BABY'S TEMPERATURE OR HAD ITS EYES AND NOSE EXAMINED OR ITS ADENOIDS CUT THEY HAD MORE CHILDREN AND THEY LOST MORE CHILDREN WITHOUT ANY REASON OR LOGIC WHATEVER POOR THINGS THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF DOING ANYTHING ELSE I SUPPOSE
WE'RE IN AN APARTMENT HOTEL WITH ONE MAID THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A SECOND MAID NO PORCH AND NO BACK YARD WELL THE BABY COMES ONE LOSES BEFORE AND AFTER THE EVENT JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS OF EVERYTHING AND OF COURSE THE EXPENSE IS FRIGHTFUL BUT NO MATTER THE BABY COMES
I'LL TALK TO HIM BEFORE THE CHILDREN'S RACES AND ONE THING MORE
EAGER TO GET STARTED DOCTOR TENISON ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE STATION
BUT WHEN I GET THINKING OF THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE GIVEN YOUR HEART TO HIM AND IF ONE OF US SHOULD DIE I COULD NOT BEAR ANOTHER WORD THE VERY IDEA OF DEATH EITHER FOR PAULA OR MYSELF WAS SIMPLY UNBEARABLE STOP I CRIED
I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEW FOR THE POOR I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I WONDER WHAT THE LORD JESUS MUST THINK OF ME HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR ME AND HERE I AM NOT WILLING TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ME TO PUT CLOTHES ON POOR FOLKS OH I MUST I MUST LEARN TO SEW NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS
SAID MISSUS WATSON THAT'S YOU HATTIE WITH ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
THE FIRST TIME WE HAD VISITED HER SHE HAD HARDLY RAISED HER HEAD FROM HER WORK AND SHOWED BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN THE STORIES THAT HER MOTHER HAD ASKED US TO READ TO HER IT WAS NOT SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS AN APPARENT INCAPACITY TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF WHAT SHE HEARD
AND LUNCHEON'S EARLY BECAUSE OF THE KELLOGG BRIDGE SHE SHUT THE BOOK AND CALL MISTER CARR BOLDT AT THE CLUB AT ONE SHE ADDED ALL THAT NOW FANCY SAID HER EMPLOYER ADMIRINGLY SHE HAD SWEPT SOME SCATTERED MAGAZINES FROM A SMALL TABLE
CATALINA STILL SUFFERED SOMEWHAT BUT NOW WAS ABLE TO WALK AROUND A BIT WITHOUT CRUTCHES AND IN SPITE OF HER DELICATE HEALTH AND POOR TWISTED BODY SHE HAD COME BRAVELY TO TAKE HER TRUE PLACE AMONG US AS OUR BIG SISTER SO LOVING AND SOLICITOUS FOR EVERYBODY'S WELFARE
TELL MISS HARRIET THAT MOTHER DOESN'T WANT HER TO DO HER GERMAN TO DAY IT'S TOO WARM TELL HER THAT SHE'S TO GO WITH YOU AND MISS VICTORIA FOR A DRIVE THANK YOU AND FRAULEIN WILL YOU TELEPHONE OLD MISSUS MC NAB AND SAY THAT MISSUS CARR BOLDT IS LYING DOWN WITH A SEVERE HEADACHE
IS MISSUS CARR BOLT YOUR MOTHER'S OR YOUR FATHER'S SISTER JOHN TENSION ASKED WATCHING HIS COMPANION WITH APPROVAL OH GOOD GRACIOUS SAID MARGARET LAUGHING OVER HER TEACUP
THAT WAS IT TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHERS THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL THING IN ALL HER THOUGHTS IN SCHOOL PAULA NEVER DID WIN PRIZES NOR DID I BOTH OF US WERE GENERALLY ABOUT ON AN EQUAL LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR CLASS
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME CHILD THAT CAN'T KNOCK VERY WELL SAID CATALINA
DON'T CRY MOTHER SHE SAID AS SHE CAUGHT A LOW SOB FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
ONE AFTERNOON WE SAID GOOD BYE TO GABRIEL AND MOUNTED THE STAIRS TO VISIT THE BLIND GIRL LEFT ALONE FOR MOST OF THE DAY SHE PASSED THE LONG HOURS KNITTING SHE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS OUR CATALINA BUT SHE APPEARED TO BE MUCH OLDER
I CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND ME AND STOLE AWAY LATER PAULA SAID TO ME OH LISITA I'M SURELY BAD INDEED ONE THING I'VE CERTAINLY HATED TO DO AND THAT IS TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN TO SEW ESPECIALLY IN FINE WEATHER LIKE THIS
THROUGH DAZZLING SEAS OF PERFUME AND OF FLOWERS UNDER THE ENCHANTED SHIFTING GREEN OF GREAT TREES OR SO MARGARET THOUGHT THERE WAS A PLUNGE FROM THE HOT STREET INTO THE AWNING COOL GLOOM OF THE HOTEL AND THEN A LUNCHEON
NO THE PROFESSOR WOULD CALL ON HER AT BAR HARBOR
AND WAS NOW SEATED THERE NEGLIGENTLY SHUFFLING A PACK OF CARDS IN HER FINE WHITE HANDS RING WILL YOU PEGGY SAID SHE AND THE BOAT RACES ARE TO DAY AND YOU DINE AT OAKS IN THE FIELD MARGARET SUPPLEMENTED INFLEXIBLY YES
HOW GLAD I AM EXCLAIMED PAULA YES MADEMOISELLE BUT I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME
ONLY TOO GLAD TO ABANDON MY TOWEL I RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN I REMAINED PETRIFIED AND DUMB WITH SURPRISE HARDLY ABLE TO BELIEVE MY OWN EYES THERE STOOD THE BRETON TWISTING HIS BATTERED CAP NERVOUSLY BETWEEN HIS BONY FINGERS
THEY SAW HIM AFTER THAT EVERY DAY AND SEVERAL TIMES A DAY MARGARET WOULD COME DOWN THE GREAT SUN BATHED STAIRWAY IN THE MORNING TO FIND HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN A PORCH CHAIR HER HEART WOULD GIVE A GREAT LEAP HALF JOY HALF NEW STRANGE PAIN AS SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
SHE LAUGHED WHAT PUT SUCH A NOTION IN YOUR HEAD DO I LOOK AS IF I WAS SICK I WAS SO RELIEVED TERESA WAS QUITE MISTAKEN NO CONTINUED PAULA
OUR JOYS WERE HERS OUR SORROWS WERE HER SORROWS SHE HAD GROWN IN BODY AND MIND AND YET HAD KEPT THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS ALWAYS BRIGHT AND HAPPY AND FULL OF FUN SHE HAD THE SAME SIMPLE HUMBLE WAYS AS WHEN AT TEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD COME AMONG US
AND SHE LIVES IN THE MOST CHARMING BRICK HOUSE WITH BRICK WALLS AND HOLLYHOCKS ALL ABOUT IT AND SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE INSIDE SHE HAS AN OLD MAID AND AN OLD GARDENER
AND AS I LOOKED AT THAT PURE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH THE EYES CLOSED IN PRAYER WITH ITS FRAME OF GLORIOUS HAIR I KNEW THAT NEVER HAD I SEEN ANYTHING SO LOVELY AS THIS CHILD COMPANION OF MINE JUST BUDDING INTO WOMANHOOD
BATH AT EIGHT STRAIGHTENED OUT THAT SQUABBLE BETWEEN SWANN AND THE COOK
WHEN PAULA HAD FINISHED SHE EXCLAIMED OH MAMMA MAMMA TELL HER TO PLEASE SING AGAIN
HER BEAUTY ALWAYS NOTABLE BECAME ALMOST STARTLING THERE WAS A NEW GLOW IN HER CHEEKS AND LIPS NEW FIRE IN THE DARK LASHED EYES THAT WERE SO CHARMING A CONTRAST TO HER BRIGHT HAIR LIKE A PAIR OF JOYOUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE CHILDREN SHE AND JOHN TENISON WALKED THROUGH THE DAYS
ARRIVING AS THEY WERE DEPARTING WERE THE SAINT GEORGE ALLENS NOISY RICH ARROGANT NEW YORKERS FOR WHOM MARGARET HAD A SPECIAL DISLIKE THE ALLENS FELL JOYOUSLY UPON THE CARR BOLDT PARTY
PAULA WAS NOW FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE
PAULA SAT BACK STIFF AND STRAIGHT IN CONSTERNATION
I SAID CONFUSED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND ME STILL SEATED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED LOST IN MY OWN REFLECTIONS PAULA SUDDENLY WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OH LISITA SHE EXCLAIMED
HE WAS EYEING HER AMUSINGLY THE DIRECT QUESTION CAME QUITE NATURALLY
HE SAID AS HE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR KITCHEN
IN FACT AS I LOOK AROUND AND SEE SO MUCH SICKNESS AND SUFFERING
WHO HAD COME INTO MY LIFE AND WHO HAD TRANSFORMED SO MANY OTHER LIVES AROUND ME AS SHE ROSE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRAYER FINDING ME STILL ON MY FEET SHE SAID WITH SURPRISE IN HER TONE NOT IN BED YET LISITA NO
AS BRISK AS EVER IN HER CRISP LINEN GOWN SHE WAS SIGNING THE CHEQUES THAT MARGARET HANDED HER FROWNINGLY BUSY AND ABSORBED WITH HER ACCOUNTS NOW SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR GLANCED AT THE WATCH AT HER WRIST AND RELAXED THE CRAMPED MUSCLES OF HER BODY THAT'S EXACTLY IT ROSE
IT ALL CAME ABOUT VERY SIMPLY
MARGARET SAID SIMPLY I WOULD LOVE TO MEET HER AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO DRAW ON HER GLOVES
PAULA THEREFORE HAD TO SUBMIT BUT THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT TERESA HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN THAT AFTERNOON PAULA HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED SOON AFTER TO COMFORT HER BUT I FOUND HER KNEELING BY HER BEDSIDE
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN HER QUIET SIMPLE WAY
THE ROSY FATHERLY WAITER WHO WAS SO MUCH DELIGHTED WITH HER GERMAN THE BUSY PICTURESQUE TRAFFIC IN THE STREET JUST BELOW THE WIDE OPEN WINDOW SHE WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER A CERTAIN FILMY SILK STRIPED GOWN A WIDE HAT LOADED WITH DAISIES
I INSISTED ON THAT AND BOTH NURSERIES WERE WASHED OUT EVERY DAY WITH CHLORIDE OF POTASH SOLUTION AND THE IRON BEDS WASHED EVERY WEEK AND EVEN THEN VIC HAD THIS MASTOID TROUBLE AND HARRIET GOT EVERYTHING ALMOST EXACTLY
TOO HAPPY EVER TO PAUSE AND ASK THEMSELVES WHITHER THEY WERE GOING THEN ABRUPTLY IT ENDED VICTORIA BROUGHT DOWN FROM SCHOOL IN SWITZERLAND WITH VARIOUS INDICATIONS OF SOMETHING WRONG WAS IN A FLASH A SICK CHILD
THAT SMILED SOFTLY AS SHE TOUCHED THEM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HER HAIR SAID THE MOTHER AS SHE GUIDED THE GIRL'S HANDS UPWARD AND OVER THE WAVES OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR THAT SEEMED LIKE AN AURORA FIT FOR SUCH A FACE AND THEN FINALLY DOWN THE LONG BRAIDS THAT EXTENDED BELOW PAULA'S WAIST
SHE SAID THE BLANKENSHIPS HAVE ONE
MY MOTHER WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE TENTH OF YOUR AUNT'S CONVERSATION YOUR AUNT WOULD FIND VERY UNINTERESTING THE THINGS THAT ARE VITAL TO MY MOTHER NO SHE COULDN'T SAY THAT SHE PICKED UP HER DASHING LITTLE HAT AND PINNED IT OVER HER LOOSENED SOFT MASS OF YELLOW HAIR AND BUTTONED UP HER STORM COAT
AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
HER SPECIAL SUMMER DELIGHT WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS ALWAYS RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS FOR CATALINA IN ONE THING ONLY SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO FAIL TERESA HAD A FEARFUL TASK IN TEACHING HER TO SEW AND TO KNIT
YOU MADEMOISELLE YOU MADE ME FEEL THAT YOU REALLY LOVED ME
AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED
AND NOW THAT I HOLD IT MAY ITS MODEST VERMILION COVER SHINE ALWAYS LIKE A LAMP UPON MY SHELVES IT IS NOT FICTION TO A BIBLIOPHILE IT IS WORTHY OF ALL THE HONOUR DONE TO VERSE
INSTEAD OF IN THEIR USUAL QUIET CORNER BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HIS MIND FOR ANYTHING BUT THE CRY THAT BROKE FROM HIM I BELIEVE I'VE DONE IT HE SAT DOWN AND EXPLAINED TO HER BY WHAT MEANS TRYING AS BEST HE COULD
FIND ITS PLACE THERE IS FEAR THAT IN COMPETITION WITH THE SERIES OF ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF MODERN LIFE THAT STRETCHES FROM THE ORDEAL OF RICHARD FEVEREL TO ONE OF OUR CONQUERORS
MA MIE POURQUOI VOUS VIDEZ VOUS
AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BUT PRETTY SOON MISTER FOX DELICATELY HINTED THAT THEY HAD COME IN RESPONSE TO THE INVITATION SENT BY MISTER POSSUM
AS HE PULLED THOUGHTFULLY AT ONE OF HIS LONG EARS OF COURSE THERE IS A REASON ASSERTED JOHNNY CHUCK CHEWING THE END OF A BLADE OF GRASS THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING ADDED STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMBING OUT THE HAIR OF HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL
THOSE SIGNS MANUAL OF OUR BRITISH DULNESS AND CRAFTY DISDAIN FOR LITERATURE ONE OR TWO OF THESE SIMULACRA THESE SHAM SEMBLANCES OF BOOKS I POSSESS BECAUSE HONOURED FRIENDS HAVE GIVEN THEM TO ME
RALPH FELT THE COLOUR IN HIS FACE WELL YOU SEE I SHALL NEED AS MUCH AS FIFTY HER HANDS FLEW TOGETHER JOYFULLY BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME HELP OH I'M SO GLAD SO GLAD
YES SIR IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM THAT WAY AND WHEN YOU SEE MISCHIEF TROTTING ALONG THE LONE LITTLE PATH IF YOU LOOK SHARP ENOUGH YOU'LL SEE TROUBLE FOLLOWING AT HIS HEELS LIKE A SHADOW I NEVER KNEW IT TO FAIL
AND THEN PRETENDED THAT HE HAD JUST COME ALONG HE WAS VERY POLITE
PRESENTLY WHILE HE WAS WONDERING WHY THEY DIDN'T JUMP ON HIM AND TEAR HIM TO PIECES OLD KING BEAR SPOKE I GUESS MISTER POSSUM WON'T PLAY ANY MORE JOKES MISTER PANTHER SAID HE
WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS A JOKE HAD BECOME NO LONGER A LAUGHING MATTER FOR HIM HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN SO HE SCRAMBLED UP A TREE HE QUITE FORGOT THAT MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX COULD CLIMB JUST AS FAST AS HE
IN RETURN FOR A SUBSTANTIAL CONSIDERATION BE PREVAILED ON TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS FOR HER SON'S ADVANTAGE TO REMAIN WITH HIS FATHER THE DAY THIS ADMISSION WAS COMMUNICATED TO RALPH
MOFFATT TWISTED HIS MOUSTACHE BETWEEN TWO PLUMP SQUARE TIPPED FINGERS WITH A LITTLE BLACK GROWTH ON THEIR LOWER JOINTS I DON'T SUPPOSE HE REMARKED THERE'S A SANE MAN BETWEEN HERE AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO ISN'T CONSUMED BY THAT YEARNING
I UNDERSTAND HE'S IN WITH ROLLIVER NOW AND ROLLIVER PRACTICALLY CONTROLS APEX THIS IS SOME KIND OF A SCHEME TO BUY UP ALL THE WORKS OF PUBLIC UTILITY AT APEX THEY'RE PRACTICALLY SURE OF THEIR CHARTER
YES BUT SUPPOSING THINGS WENT WRONG NOTHING CAN IF YOU'LL ONLY TAKE IT I MAY LOSE IT I SHA'N'T IF I'VE GIVEN IT TO YOU
AND TO COIL DIRECTLY FROM SOME BOTTLE OF A GENIE AH WHAT A BOTTLE AS WE WHIRL ALONG IN THE VAST AND GLOWING BACCHANAL WE CRY LIKE SGANARELLE QU'ILS
IN GERMANY OR ITALY OR DENMARK EVEN SUCH GIFTS AS HIS WOULD LONG AGO HAVE FOUND THEIR CLASSIC PLACE ABOVE FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT ENGLAND IS A GALLIO
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO CARRY THE NEWS TO HIS COUSIN HIS MOOD WAS ONE OF PURE EXALTATION HE SEEMED TO BE HUGGING HIS BOY TO HIM AS HE WALKED PAUL AND HE WERE TO BELONG TO EACH OTHER FOREVER
HE STOOPED HIS HEAD ABOVE HER HANDS I ACCEPT HE SAID AND THEY STOOD AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER LIKE RADIANT CHILDREN SHE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR AND AS HE TURNED TO LEAVE
TOUCHED THE GREAT LION WITH THE BROKEN SAPPHIRE HAIR OF GARRAVEEN OR AGAIN HOW ON THE BLACK COAST OF THE ENCHANTED SEA WANDERING BY MOONLIGHT HE FOUND THE SACRED LILY AND TORE IT UP AND LO
IN THIS NEW WORLD ONE AFTERNOON DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI STANDING IN FRONT OF HIS EASEL REMARKED TO ALL PRESENT WHOM IT SHOULD CONCERN THAT THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT WAS A BOOK WHICH SHAKESPEARE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO WRITE
CONTRIVED TO CALL HER BODY GUARD OF SNAKES HISSING AND SCREAMING AROUND HER THERE IS SURELY NO MODERN BOOK SO UNSULLIED AS THIS IS BY THE MODERN SPIRIT NONE IN WHICH THE DESIRE TO TEACH A LESSON
THE SUM HIS WIFE DEMANDED COULD BE ACQUIRED ONLY BY A QUICK TURN AND THE FACT THAT RALPH HAD ONCE RENDERED THE SAME KIND OF SERVICE TO MOFFATT MADE IT NATURAL TO APPEAL TO HIM NOW THE MARKET MOREOVER HAPPENED TO BE BOOMING
OH IF YOU'RE SURE RALPH WAS ALREADY CALCULATING THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO DASH UP TO CLARE VAN DEGEN'S ON HIS WAY TO CATCH THE TRAIN FOR THE FAIRFORDS HIS IMPATIENCE MADE IT HARD TO PAY DUE REGARD TO MOFFATT'S PARTING CIVILITIES
AND A MASTERPIECE OF MORALITY LIKE THE EGOIST IN THE OTHER I CAN DOUBT WHICH IS THE GREATER BOOK BUT THERE ARE MOODS IN WHICH I AM JEALOUS OF THE NOVELS AND WISH TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH MY ARABIAN ENTERTAINMENT
I THINK SO WELL I GUESS I CAN DOUBLE IT FOR YOU MOFFATT SPOKE WITH AN AIR OF OLYMPIAN MODESTY ANYHOW I'LL TRY ONLY DON'T TELL THE OTHER GIRLS
AND BESIDES WHAT ON EARTH DOES IT MATTER THE GREAT THING IS THAT IT'S DONE SHE LIFTED HER SPARKLING EYES AND NOW MY SHARE YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME HE EXPLAINED THAT MISTER DAGONET
HE HELD THE ORIENTAL TOY AGAINST THE LIGHT OH I AIN'T A JUDGE BUT NOW AND THEN I LIKE TO PICK UP A PRETTY THING RALPH NOTICED THAT HIS EYES CARESSED IT WELL NOW LET'S TALK
PORTRAYED BY A POWERFUL ARTIST CAST ON HER THE SATISFIED EYE OF PROPRIETORSHIP RALPH SWEPT FORWARD ON THE BLAST OF HIS EXCITEMENT FELT AS IN A DREAM THE FRIVOLOUS PERVERSITY OF HER RECEIVING HIM IN SUCH A SETTING
GRANDFATHER FROG SNAPPED AT A FOOLISH GREEN FLY AND WHEN IT WAS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS THREE LITTLE VISITORS AND THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES
WITH ITS MAHOGANY BOOKCASES CONTAINING MOROCCO BOUND SETS AND ITS WIDE BLUE LEATHER ARM CHAIRS LACKED ONLY A PALM OR TWO TO RESEMBLE THE LOUNGE OF A FASHIONABLE HOTEL MOFFATT HIMSELF AS HE CAME FORWARD
AFTER THE POURING OF HIGH MUSIC FOR TWO GENERATIONS INTO EARS WHOSE OWNERS SEEMED TO HAVE WILFULLY SEALED THEM WITH WAX SO THAT ONLY THE MOST STACCATO AND LEAST HAPPY NOTES EVER REACHED THEIR DULNESS
IN WHAT IS UTTERLY OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF EXPERIENCE IT BELONGS TO THAT INFANCY OF THE WORLD WHEN THE HAPPY GUILELESS HUMAN BEING STILL HOLDS THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A FLOWER TO BE PLUCKED A LAMP TO BE RUBBED
DELICIOUS IN THIS HARSH WORLD OF REALITY TO FOLD A MIST AROUND US AND OUT OF IT TO EVOLVE THE YELLOW DOMES AND BLACK CYPRESSES THE SILVER FOUNTAINS AND MARBLE PILLARS
AND HE WENT OFF THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST LAUGHING FIT TO KILL HIMSELF PRETTY SOON HE MET MISTER PANTHER HE WAS VERY POLITE TO MISTER PANTHER HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM A CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND HINTED THAT OLD KING BEAR WAS THEN ENJOYING A FEAST
RALPH CAUGHT THE LOOK AND A FLOOD OF OLD TENDERNESSES AND HATES WELLED UP IN HIM HE DREW HER UNDER THE PORTRAIT
IS TAMED BY A SENSE THAT THE SHOW IS CLOSING AND THAT SHIBLI BAGARAG HAS BEEN TOO PROMPTLY SUCCESSFUL IN SMITING THROUGH THE IDENTICAL BUT PERHAPS OF ALL GIFTS
I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE WARM ROSSETTI LANGUAGE THIS DID NOT MEAN THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING SPECIALLY REMINISCENT OF THE BARD OF AVON IN THIS BOOK BUT SIMPLY THAT IT WAS A MONSTROUS FINE PRODUCTION AND WORTHY OF ALL ATTENTION
THEN OF COURSE GRANDFATHER FROG KNOWS IT SAID PETER OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF HIM BEFORE EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE SMILING POOL SHOUTED PETER OF COURSE HE DID
GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED JUST TO FOOL PEOPLE STUPID SAID HE OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS HOW HE EVER FOUND OUT THAT HE COULD FOOL PEOPLE THAT WAY
AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH FOR MISTER PANTHER IF HE HURRIED UP THERE AT ONCE NOW MISTER PANTHER WAS HUNGRY FOR HE HAD FOUND NOTHING FOR HIS BREAKFAST THAT MORNING SO HE THANKED OLD MISTER POSSUM AND HURRIED AWAY TO FIND OLD KING BEAR
LED RALPH INTO THE GILDED AND TAPESTRIED WILDERNESS WHERE SHE OCCASIONALLY CHOSE TO RECEIVE HER VISITORS THERE UNDER POPPLE'S EFFIGY OF HERSELF SHE SAT SMALL AND ALONE ON A MONUMENTAL SOFA
THE TRUE GENIUS OF THE EAST BREATHES IN MEREDITH'S PAGES AND THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AT ALL EVENTS IN THE CRUDE LITERALITY OF SIR RICHARD BURTON PALE BEFORE THEM LIKE A MIRAGE
HE FELT A MOMENT'S TREMOR HE KNEW HE COULD COUNT ON HALF THE AMOUNT FROM HIS GRANDFATHER
THE MEANS OF RAISING THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAME DURING THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE ANXIOUS THEME OF ALL RALPH'S THOUGHTS HIS LAWYERS ENQUIRIES SOON BROUGHT THE CONFIRMATION OF CLARE'S SURMISE
IT IS NEARLY FORTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST HEARD OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT I WAS NEWLY COME IN ALL MY CALLOW ARDOUR INTO THE COVENANT OF ART AND LETTERS AND I WAS MOVING ABOUT STILL BEWILDERED IN A NEW WORLD
WHAT CLINGS MOST TO THE MEMORY IS HOW SHIBLI BAGARAG
YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE FUNDS FOR YOUR YOUR INVESTMENT WITHIN THREE WEEKS THAT'S QUICK WORK AND YOU WANT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CAN YOU PUT UP FIFTY RALPH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE QUESTION BUT WHEN IT CAME
WHENEVER HE WAS CAUGHT SO THE NEXT TIME HE GOT IN TROUBLE INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY HE TRIED PLAYING DEAD IT WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT HE TAUGHT HIS CHILDREN HOW TO DO IT AND THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN AND SO ON DOWN TO UNC BILLY WHOM YOU KNOW
RALPH WAS TOO DEEP IN HIS OWN TROUBLES TO WASTE ANY WONDER OVER THIS ANTICLIMAX BUT THE FREQUENT APPEARANCE OF MOFFATT'S NAME IN THE MORNING PAPERS ACTED AS AN UNCONSCIOUS SUGGESTION BESIDES TO WHOM ELSE COULD HE LOOK FOR HELP
HEARD OF A SOFT THING THAT WON'T WAIT I PRESUME
ONE THING PUZZLED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GREAT DEAL AFTER THEY HAD COME TO KNOW UNC BILLY POSSUM AND HIS FUNNY WAYS THEY HAD TALKED IT OVER AND WONDERED AND WONDERED ABOUT IT AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND IT
THERE IS NONE MORE RARE THAN THIS OF CLEARING THE BOARD AND LEAVING THE READER STILL HUNGRY WHO SHALL SAY IN DEALING WITH SUCH A BOOK WHAT PASSAGE IN IT IS BEST OR WORST
AND SHARE IN THE GOOD THINGS OLD MISTER POSSUM HAD TOLD ABOUT OLD MISTER POSSUM HIMSELF HURRIED ON CHUCKLING AS HE THOUGHT OF THE WAY MISTER PANTHER WAS LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED WITH OLD KING BEAR IN SUCH A TEMPER
WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH AGAIN HE STILL KEPT HIS EYES CLOSED
THE ZOOLOGISTS ARE UPON US OF OOLB OR AKLIS THE GEOGRAPHERS FLOURISH THEIR MAPS AT US IN DEFIANCE BUT THE AUTHOR OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT IN THE BLOOM OF HIS HAPPY YOUTHFUL GENIUS
AND MOTHER OF PEARL LITTLE BY LITTLE EVEN OUR CHILDREN ARE LOSING THIS HAPPY GIFT OF BELIEVING THE INCREDIBLE
EVEN SO I WOULD VALUE THE GIFT MORE IN THE DECENCY OF A SINGLE VOLUME THE DEAR LITTLE DUODECIMOS OF THE LAST CENTURY OF COURSE ARE WELCOME IN A LIBRARY THAT WAS A HAPPY DAY WHEN BY THE DISCOVERY OF
FOR UNC BILLY'S MAMMY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING UP FROM OL VIRGINNY TO THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS WHERE THEY LIVED HE SAID IT JUST TO TEASE THEM AND WHEN HE SAID IT HE CHUCKLED UNTIL THEY CHUCKLED TOO
AND THAT CLASS OF WRITING WHICH SEEMS TO REQUIRE LESS EFFORT THAN ANY OTHER AND TO BE A MERE SPINNING OF GOLD THREAD OUT OF THE POET'S INNER CONSCIOUSNESS IS LESS AND LESS AT COMMAND AND WHEN EXECUTED GIVES LESS AND LESS SATISFACTION
INTERRUPTED PETER GRANDFATHER FROG SCOWLED AT PETER IF I HAVE ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS THERE WILL BE NO STORY TO DAY SAID HE SEVERELY PETER LOOKED ASHAMED
THE VARIETY OF SCENES AND IMAGES THE UNTIRING EVOLUTION OF PLOT THE KALEIDOSCOPIC SHIFTING OF HARMONIOUS COLOURS ALL THESE SEEM OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF ARABIA
THE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN EACH LICKING HIS CHOPS
NEVERTHELESS THE LOOKING ABOUT HAD TO BE DONE AND A DAY CAME WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE AT THE DOOR OF ELMER MOFFATT'S OFFICE HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN DRAWN BACK TO MOFFATT
THAT YOU WILL HAVE A STORY AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE SOONER I TELL IT TO YOU THE SOONER YOU WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE UNC BILLY POSSUM'S GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED WAS WAS THIS WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU HE HEARD THE LATTER ASSURING HIM WITH A FINAL HAND GRASP WISH YOU'D DINE WITH ME SOME EVENING AT MY CLUB AND AS RALPH MURMURED A VAGUE ACCEPTANCE HOW'S THAT BOY OF YOURS BY THE WAY MOFFATT CONTINUED
I WILL GET SOME DRIED HERBS AND MAKE YOU A DRINK BUT I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT IT IS TOO LATE WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BEFORE
IN LATER TIMES THE FURIES CAME TO BE REGARDED AS SALUTARY AGENCIES WHO BY SEVERELY PUNISHING SIN UPHELD THE CAUSE OF MORALITY AND SOCIAL ORDER AND THUS CONTRIBUTED TO THE WELFARE OF MANKIND
SHE ONCE MORE CHANGED TO HER FORMER LOVELY APPEARANCE AND TOLD THE PRINCE THAT HER LUGGAGE WAS NOW ALL ON BOARD AND THAT THEY NEED WAIT FOR NOTHING MORE THE PRINCE GAVE ORDERS TO SET SAIL AT ONCE
THEN THEY RUSHED WITH ONE ACCORD TO THE COFFIN AND LIFTED THE LID SO THAT THE MAN COULD STEP OUT AMONGST THEM WERE YOU REALLY NOT DEAD AFTER ALL ASKED THEY AND IF NOT WHY DID YOU LET YOURSELF BE BURIED
AGED HIDEOUS AND ALSO LAME WHICH IS EVIDENTLY MEANT TO INDICATE THE SLOW AND HALTING MARCH OF DESTINY WHICH THEY CONTROLLED PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS ON THE OTHER HAND DEPICTED THEM AS BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS OF A GRAVE BUT KINDLY ASPECT
IT WAS CONSIDERED THE FUNCTION OF THE MOIRAE TO INDICATE TO THE FURIES THE PRECISE TORTURE WHICH THE WICKED SHOULD UNDERGO FOR THEIR CRIMES
I SHALL TAKE CARE TO HAVE ALL THAT PACK OF COURTIERS PUT TO DEATH AND THEN I SHALL SEND FOR ALL MY RELATIONS TO COME AND LIVE HERE INSTEAD I FANCY THE GIANTS WILL ENJOY THEMSELVES VERY MUCH WITH ME AND MY HUSBAND
WHEN THEY PURSUED ORESTES THEY CONSTANTLY HELD UP A MIRROR TO HIS HORRIFIED GAZE IN WHICH HE BEHELD THE FACE OF HIS MURDERED MOTHER
SEES IN IT A HIGHER OR MORE ENERGETIC KIND OF SELF DISCIPLINE THAN MOST PEOPLE PRACTISE IN THE END THEY COME TO THE SAME AS A VIGOROUS EFFORT OF THE WILL
JUST KEEP QUITE QUIET FOR BEFORE THE SUN RISES YOU WILL BE A DEAD MAN THE MAN WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AT HER WORDS AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL WHILE THE UNDERTAKER CAME AND MEASURED HIM FOR HIS COFFIN
YES I AM AFRAID HE IS TRYING REPLIED THE FIRST BUT LET US PUT THEM TO THE PROOF AND SEE WHICH OF THEM IS THE MOST FOOLISH SO ABOUT THE TIME THAT SHE EXPECTED HER HUSBAND HOME FROM WORK
THE MAN WHO ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED THAT HE WAS WEARING FINE CLOTHES WHEN HE WAS DRESSED IN NOTHING OR THE MAN WHO LET HIMSELF BE BURIED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND WELL SO THE WOMEN QUARRELLED JUST AS MUCH AS THEY DID BEFORE
IT MAY BE GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE APPLICATION TO IT OF WILL AND FORESIGHT AND IN THE BEGINNING SELF SUGGESTION HE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE THREE AS ONE
SHE GOT OUT HER SPINNING WHEEL AND SAT BUSILY TURNING IT TAKING CARE NOT EVEN TO LOOK UP FROM HER WORK WHEN THE MAN CAME IN FOR SOME MINUTES HE STOOD WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN WATCHING HER AND AS SHE STILL REMAINED SILENT HE SAID AT LAST
TO FASTEN DOWN THE LID AND CARRY HIM TO THE GRAVE WHERE ALL THEIR FRIENDS WERE WAITING THEM JUST AS THE BODY WAS BEING PLACED IN THE GROUND THE OTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND CAME RUNNING UP DRESSED AS FAR AS ANYONE COULD SEE IN NO CLOTHES AT ALL
HOW DELIGHTED THE WITCH WAS WHEN SHE FOUND THE CLOTHES ALL FINISHED THE NEXT TIME PRINCE RING CAME TO SEE HER SHE GAVE THEM TO HIM AND HE PAID HER MANY COMPLIMENTS ON HER SKILFUL WORK
ALL AMOUNTS TO FORESIGHT AND HYPNOTIC PREPARATION IN A CRUDE IMPERFECT FORM IF ANY ARTIST WHO IS GIFTED WITH RESOLUTION AND PERSEVERANCE WILL SIMPLY MAKE TRIAL OF THE METHOD HERE RECOMMENDED
TO ACT AS SERVANTS TO THE ERINYES THE HARPIES WOULD APPEAR TO BE PERSONIFICATIONS OF SUDDEN TEMPESTS WHICH WITH RUTHLESS VIOLENCE SWEEP OVER WHOLE DISTRICTS CARRYING OFF OR INJURING ALL BEFORE THEM
AND WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE SOBBED OUT OH MY POOR POOR HUSBAND ARE YOU REALLY DEAD I MUST GO TO MORROW AND ORDER YOUR COFFIN NOW WHEN THE MAN HEARD THIS A COLD SHIVER RAN THROUGH HIS BODY
AND WHO TAKE NO REAL INTEREST IN ANYTHING EXCEPT SPENDING MONEY AND GOSSIPING ARE TO BE REALLY PITIED IS TRUE SOME OF THEM ONCE HAD MINDS AND THESE ARE THE MOST PITIFUL OR PITIABLE OF ALL
TO A DIVINITY OF FATE THE BRIGHTEST AND SADDEST SCENES OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE ARE ALIKE INDIFFERENT AND THAT SHE QUIETLY AND STEADILY PURSUES HER OCCUPATION REGARDLESS OF HUMAN WEAL OR WOE
DURING HIS ABSENCE THE QUEEN FELL ILL AND AFTER LINGERING FOR SOME TIME SHE DIED TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF HER CHILDREN THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO LIVE ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME IN THEIR TREES
AND THEIR ORIGIN WAS VARIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDING TO HESIOD THEY SPRANG FROM THE BLOOD OF URANUS WHEN WOUNDED BY CRONUS
WHEN ASMUND SAW ALL THESE WILD DOINGS FROM HIS TREE HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER KEEP SILENCE HE WENT TO PRINCE RING AND SAID
I WILL TRY EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE SAID THE WIFE WHO DID NOT IN THE LEAST WISH HER HUSBAND TO DIE
BECAUSE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO HAD AT AN AVERAGE AGE OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN LEARNED THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO SEVERAL KINDS OF HANDIWORK AND KNEW THE DIFFERENCES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF GOTHIC
AND WHEN STUDIED ARE EASILY RECALLED AFTER A LITTLE PRACTICE THE MANNER IN WHICH MOST ARTISTS FORM AN IDEA OR PROJECT THEIR MINDS TO A PLAN OR INVENTION
THAT HE DETERMINED TO MARRY HER IF POSSIBLE SO HE BEGGED HIS FATHER TO LET HIM HAVE A SHIP FOR THE VOYAGE SET SAIL WITH A FAVOURABLE WIND
AFTER WHICH HE TOOK LEAVE OF HER IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER BUT HE HAD SCARCELY LEFT THE HOUSE WHEN THE WITCH BEGAN TO RAGE AS FURIOUSLY AS EVER AND NEVER STOPPED TILL HER BROTHER IRONHEAD APPEARED
FOR THEY APPEARED UPON EARTH AS THE AVENGING DEITIES WHO RELENTLESSLY PURSUED AND PUNISHED MURDERERS PERJURERS THOSE WHO HAD FAILED IN DUTY TO THEIR PARENTS
AND AFTER SHE HAD CLEANED HER HOUSE AND FED HER CHICKENS AND PUT EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE AGAIN SHE BENT OVER THE KITCHEN TABLE AND THE SOUND OF HER BIG SCISSORS MIGHT BE HEARD SNIP SNAP AS FAR AS THE GARDEN HER HUSBAND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING TO SNIP AT
AT THIS THE WIVES BOTH CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD EACH WISHED TO PROVE THAT HER HUSBAND WAS STUPIDER THAN THE OTHER BUT THE VILLAGERS DECLARED THAT THEY COULD NOT DECIDE WHICH WAS THE MOST FOOLISH
APOLLO AND ARTEMIS WERE MERELY THE INSTRUMENTS FOR AVENGING THE INSULT OFFERED TO THEIR MOTHER BUT IT WAS NEMESIS WHO PROMPTED THE DEED AND PRESIDED OVER ITS EXECUTION HOMER MAKES NO MENTION OF NEMESIS
AND THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS THAT THE TWO HUNDRED WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND IN EVERY BRANCH GEOGRAPHY ARITHMETIC HISTORY AND SO ON IT WAS NOT REMARKABLE
THREW ONE OF THEM OVER HER BACK AND CLASPED THE OTHER TO HER BREAST CARRIED THEM DOWN TO THE SHORE AND WADED OUT WITH THEM TO THE SHIP SHE TOOK CARE NOT TO BE NOTICED AS SHE REACHED THE SHIP AND DIRECTLY SHE GOT ON BOARD
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL IDEA DO LET ME COME TOO AND LIVE IN ONE OF YOUR TREES I WILL BRING ALL MY PRETTY THINGS AND ORNAMENTS AND THE TREES ARE SO NEAR HOME WE SHALL BE QUITE SAFE IN THEM
MY PUPILS WERE TAUGHT FIRSTLY SIMPLE OUTLINE DECORATIVE DESIGN WITH DRAWING AT THE SAME TIME AFTER THIS ACCORDING TO SEX EASY EMBROIDERY WOOD CARVING
HE DID BUT WAS ASHAMED TO SAY SO AND ONLY ANSWERED WELL I AM SURE IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL SINCE YOU SAY SO AND I SHALL BE SMARTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WHOLE VILLAGE WHAT A SPLENDID COAT THEY WILL EXCLAIM WHEN THEY SEE ME
BUT NOW I REALLY DO SEEM TO SEE SOMETHING THE WOMAN SMILED AND WAS SILENT AND AFTER SPINNING BUSILY FOR AN HOUR MORE SHE GOT UP FROM HER STOOP AND BEGAN TO WEAVE AS FAST AS SHE COULD AT LAST SHE GOT UP
MODELING IN CLAY LEATHER WORK CARPENTERING INLAYING
THE RESULT OF SUCH EDUCATION IS TO DEVELOP A GREAT GENERAL QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION AND THOUGHT NOW BE IT OBSERVED THAT IF ANYONE DESIRES TO LEARN DESIGN OR ANY ART
ZEUS HIMSELF BEING POWERLESS TO AVERT HER DECREES BUT IN LATER TIMES THIS CONCEPTION OF ONE INEXORABLE ALL CONQUERING FATE BECAME AMPLIFIED BY THE POETS INTO THAT ABOVE DESCRIBED
AND EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND OTHER JEWELS THE PRINCE HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEFORE THE WITCH RESUMED HER PROPER SHAPE AND TORE ABOUT THE ROOM RAGING AND STORMING AND FLINGING THE BEAUTIFUL SILK ON THE FLOOR
PORCELAIN PAINTING AND OTHER SMALL ARTS NEARLY ALL OF THE PUPILS WHO WERE FROM TEN TO SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE ACQUIRED TWO OR THREE IF NOT ALL OF THESE ARTS
THEN HE PICKS UP STONES IN THE ROAD AND SOWS THEM INSTEAD OF POTATOES AND ONE DAY HE WANTED TO GO INTO THE GARDEN FROM THE TOP WINDOW BECAUSE HE DECLARED IT WAS A SHORTER WAY THAN THROUGH THE DOOR
THERE LIVED A KING WHO REIGNED OVER A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY HE WAS MARRIED TO A WIFE WHOM HE DEARLY LOVED AND HAD TWO MOST PROMISING CHILDREN A SON CALLED ASMUND
IT DOES NOT FEEL VERY WARM OBSERVED THE MAN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD BORNE ALL THIS PATIENTLY FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SO FINE ANSWERED SHE YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO BE AS THICK AS THE ROUGH CLOTHES YOU WEAR EVERY DAY
AT THEIR INSTIGATION AN INQUIRY WAS MADE OF ALL THE TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS TO THE STANDING OF MY ART PUPILS IN THEIR OTHER CLASSES IT BEING CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE FALLEN BEHIND
GOES INTO ANOTHER ROOM TO REPRODUCE IT FROM MEMORY ORIGINAL DESIGN WHICH WHEN PROPERLY TAUGHT IS LEARNED WITH INCREDIBLE EASE BY ALL CHILDREN STIMULATES OBSERVATION TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE
BY AWARDING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL THE FATE WHICH HIS ACTIONS DESERVE SHE REWARDS HUMBLE UNACKNOWLEDGED MERIT PUNISHES CRIME DEPRIVES THE WORTHLESS OF UNDESERVED GOOD FORTUNE
I AM SIGNY THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS THE REPLY THEN THE PRINCE INQUIRED WHY SHE WAS WANDERING ABOUT ALL BY HERSELF AND SHE TOLD HIM THAT SINCE HER MOTHER'S DEATH
THEY WERE REPRESENTED WITH THE HEAD OF A FAIR HAIRED MAIDEN AND THE BODY OF A VULTURE AND WERE PERPETUALLY DEVOURED BY THE PANGS OF INSATIABLE HUNGER WHICH CAUSED THEM TO TORMENT THEIR VICTIMS BY ROBBING THEM OF THEIR FOOD
ASMUND WHO WAS EXTREMELY FOND OF HIS SISTER READILY CONSENTED AND THEY HAD A VERY HAPPY TIME TOGETHER CARRYING OVER ALL THEIR PET TREASURES AND SIGNY'S JEWELS AND OTHER ORNAMENTS
BUT THEN HE WAS SO STUPID THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING AFTER THE CUTTING CAME THE SEWING THE WOMAN PATTED AND PINNED AND FIXED AND JOINED AND THEN TURNING TO THE MAN SHE SAID NOW IT IS READY FOR YOU TO TRY ON
THE POWER WHICH THEY WIELDED OVER THE FATE OF MAN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INDICATED UNDER THE FIGURE OF A THREAD WHICH THEY SPUN OUT FOR THE LIFE OF EACH HUMAN BEING FROM HIS BIRTH TO THE GRAVE THIS OCCUPATION THEY DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM
THEY NOW LOSE THEIR AWE INSPIRING ASPECT AND ARE REPRESENTED MORE ESPECIALLY IN ATHENS AS EARNEST MAIDENS DRESSED LIKE ARTEMIS IN SHORT TUNICS SUITABLE FOR THE CHASE BUT STILL RETAINING IN THEIR HANDS
THE PART PLAYED BY THIS ELEMENT OF APTITUDE IN DETERMINING THE RELATIVE TENACITY OF THE SEVERAL HABITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE STANDARD OF LIVING GOES TO EXPLAIN THE EXTREME RELUCTANCE WITH WHICH MEN GIVE UP ANY HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IN THE WAY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
MAY OFFSET A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE UNFOLDING OF LIFE IN THE GIVEN DIRECTION
OF PRAISE OR BLAME UNCERTAIN THIS IS PECULIARLY TRUE WHERE THE DERELICTION INVOLVES AN APPRECIABLE PREDATORY OR PIRATICAL ELEMENT THIS TOPIC NEED SCARCELY BE PURSUED FURTHER HERE
HE DOES NOT ORDINARILY INCUR THE EXTREME PENALTY OR THE EXTREME OBLOQUY WITH WHICH HIS OFFENSES WOULD BE VISITED ON THE GROUND OF THE NAIVE MORAL CODE ALONE THE THIEF OR SWINDLER WHO HAS GAINED GREAT WEALTH BY HIS DELINQUENCY
THE NEED OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THEREFORE STANDS READY TO ABSORB ANY INCREASE IN THE COMMUNITY'S INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY OR OUTPUT OF GOODS AFTER THE MOST ELEMENTARY PHYSICAL WANTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR WHERE THIS RESULT DOES NOT FOLLOW UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS
THE DISCHARGE WILL SEEK THE ACCUSTOMED OUTLET EVEN AFTER A CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHEREBY THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE HAS APPRECIABLY RISEN THAT HEIGHTENED FACILITY OF EXPRESSION IN A GIVEN DIRECTION WHICH IS CALLED HABIT
IT IS PLEASING TO OUR SENSE OF WHAT IS FITTING IN THESE MATTERS IN EITHER CASE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE OBVIOUS PERFUNCTORINESS OF THE SERVICE THAT IT IS A PRO FORMA EXECUTION ONLY
ORDINARILY WITH A VIEW TO HEIGHTENING THE SPECTACULAR EFFECT OF THE AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE CONTEMPLATED AS INCREASED INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROCURE THE MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD WITH LESS LABOR
BUT THE INCREMENT OF OUTPUT IS TURNED TO USE TO MEET THIS WANT WHICH IS INDEFINITELY EXPANSIBLE AFTER THE MANNER COMMONLY IMPUTED IN ECONOMIC THEORY TO HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL WANTS
ARE TRACED BACK BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS TO THE USAGES AND HABITS OF THOUGHT OF THE HIGHEST SOCIAL AND PECUNIARY CLASS THE WEALTHY LEISURE CLASS IT IS FOR THIS CLASS TO DETERMINE IN GENERAL OUTLINE WHAT SCHEME OF LIFE THE COMMUNITY SHALL ACCEPT AS DECENT OR HONORIFIC
IS NOT A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO EXCEL IN THE EXPENSIVENESS OF THEIR VISIBLE CONSUMPTION SO MUCH AS IT IS A DESIRE TO LIVE UP TO THE CONVENTIONAL STANDARD OF DECENCY IN THE AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED THIS DESIRE IS NOT GUIDED BY A RIGIDLY INVARIABLE STANDARD
TO ACCEPT AND PRACTICE THE STANDARD OF LIVING WHICH IS IN VOGUE IS BOTH AGREEABLE AND EXPEDIENT COMMONLY TO THE POINT OF BEING INDISPENSABLE TO PERSONAL COMFORT AND TO SUCCESS IN LIFE THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF ANY CLASS
THE REASON FOR THE DISCREPANCY IS COMMONLY TO BE SOUGHT IN A RATE OF INCREASE IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S WEALTH TOO RAPID FOR THE HABIT OF EXPENDITURE TO KEEP ABREAST OF IT OR IT MAY BE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION DEFERS THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF THE INCREMENT TO A LATER DATE
IT ACTS ALMOST SOLELY TO PREVENT RECESSION FROM A SCALE OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE THAT HAS ONCE BECOME HABITUAL A STANDARD OF LIVING IS OF THE NATURE OF HABIT IT IS AN HABITUAL SCALE AND METHOD OF RESPONDING TO GIVEN STIMULI
AND UNWORTHY MOTIVES OF MISERLINESS ARE IMPUTED TO THOSE WHO FALL SHORT IN THIS RESPECT A PROMPT RESPONSE TO THE STIMULUS ON THE OTHER HAND IS ACCEPTED AS THE NORMAL EFFECT
AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THIS WEALTH WHICH IS HELD SACRED IS VALUED PRIMARILY FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD REPUTE TO BE GOT THROUGH ITS CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
AS WELL AS OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT ARE THE FIT AND ADEQUATE MANNER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIVINE COMMUNION IT IS FELT THAT THE DIVINITY MUST BE OF A PECULIARLY SERENE AND LEISURELY HABIT OF LIFE AND WHENEVER HIS LOCAL HABITATION IS PICTURED IN POETIC IMAGERY
IN HIS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AND IN HIS EMPLOYMENT OF TIME AND EFFORT THIS GROWTH OF PRESCRIPTIVE USAGE HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT UPON ECONOMIC LIFE
AND THERE IS AN HONORIFIC IMPLICATION FOR THEIR MASTER IN THEIR REMAINING UNPROFITABLE IT IS NEEDLESS TO POINT OUT THE CLOSE ANALOGY AT THIS POINT BETWEEN THE PRIESTLY OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF THE FOOTMAN
THE TERM SERVICE CARRIES A SUGGESTION SIGNIFICANT FOR THE POINT IN QUESTION GROWS MORE PERFUNCTORY AS THE CULT GAINS IN AGE AND CONSISTENCY AND THIS PERFUNCTORINESS OF THE REHEARSAL IS VERY PLEASING TO THE CORRECT DEVOUT TASTE AND WITH A GOOD REASON
IT IS NOT ONLY IN ESTABLISHING A DEVOUT STANDARD OF DECENT EXPENSIVENESS THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF WASTE INVADES THE DOMAIN OF THE CANONS OF RITUAL SERVICEABILITY IT TOUCHES THE WAYS AS WELL AS THE MEANS AND DRAWS ON VICARIOUS LEISURE AS WELL AS ON VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION
MAY BECOME MORE INDISPENSABLE THAN MUCH OF THAT EXPENDITURE WHICH MINISTERS TO THE LOWER WANTS OF PHYSICAL WELL BEING OR SUSTENANCE ONLY IT IS NOTORIOUSLY JUST AS DIFFICULT TO RECEDE FROM A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING AS IT IS TO LOWER A STANDARD WHICH IS ALREADY RELATIVELY LOW
OF A PECUNIARY STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY BACK DIRECTLY AND BALDLY TO THE UNDERLYING NORM OF PECUNIARY EMULATION
A WELL BRED EXPENDITURE OF HIS BOOTY ESPECIALLY APPEALS WITH GREAT EFFECT TO PERSONS OF A CULTIVATED SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES AND GOES FAR TO MITIGATE THE SENSE OF MORAL TURPITUDE WITH WHICH HIS DERELICTION IS VIEWED BY THEM IT MAY BE NOTED ALSO
THE ARTICLES OR FORMS OF CONSUMPTION TO WHICH THE CONSUMER CLINGS WITH THE GREATEST TENACITY ARE COMMONLY THE SO CALLED NECESSARIES OF LIFE OR THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM IS OF COURSE NOT A RIGIDLY DETERMINED ALLOWANCE OF GOODS
IT IS OF COURSE IN THE MORE NAIVE CULTS THAT THIS SUFFUSION OF PECUNIARY BEAUTY IS MOST PATENT BUT IT IS VISIBLE THROUGHOUT ALL PEOPLES AT WHATEVER STAGE OF CULTURE OR DEGREE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
IN ALL SUCH USEFUL ARTICLES A CLOSE SCRUTINY WILL DISCOVER CERTAIN FEATURES WHICH ADD TO THE COST AND ENHANCE THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THE GOODS IN QUESTION BUT DO NOT PROPORTIONATELY INCREASE THE SERVICEABILITY OF THESE ARTICLES FOR THE MATERIAL PURPOSES
FOR THE END OF VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION IS TO ENHANCE NOT THE FULLNESS OF LIFE OF THE CONSUMER BUT THE PECUNIARY REPUTE OF THE MASTER FOR WHOSE BEHOOF THE CONSUMPTION TAKES PLACE THEREFORE PRIESTLY VESTMENTS ARE NOTORIOUSLY EXPENSIVE ORNATE
IN THE LATTER CASE THE SANCTUARY AND ITS FITTINGS TAKE ON MORE OF THE FASHION GIVEN TO GOODS DESTINED FOR THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF A TEMPORAL MASTER OR OWNER ON THE OTHER HAND WHERE THE SACRED APPARATUS IS SIMPLY EMPLOYED IN THE DIVINITY'S SERVICE
THE SANCTUARY AND ITS FITTINGS HAVE SOMETHING OF THIS AUSTERITY IN ALL THE CULTS IN WHICH THE SAINT OR DIVINITY TO WHOM THE SANCTUARY PERTAINS IS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE PRESENT AND MAKE PERSONAL USE OF THE PROPERTY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF LUXURIOUS TASTES IMPUTED TO HIM
THE ENERGIES OF THE INDUSTRIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE BENT TO THE COMPASSING OF A HIGHER RESULT IN CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE RATHER THAN SLACKENED TO A MORE COMFORTABLE PACE THE STRAIN IS NOT LIGHTENED AS INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY INCREASES AND MAKES A LIGHTER STRAIN POSSIBLE
TASTES PROPENSITIES AND HABITS OF LIFE IMPUTED TO THE DIVINITY BY WORSHIPPERS WHO LIVE UNDER THE TRADITION OF THESE PECUNIARY CANONS OF REPUTABILITY THROUGH ITS PERVADING MEN'S HABITS OF THOUGHT
HAS A BETTER CHANCE THAN THE SMALL THIEF OF ESCAPING THE RIGOROUS PENALTY OF THE LAW AND SOME GOOD REPUTE ACCRUES TO HIM FROM HIS INCREASED WEALTH AND FROM HIS SPENDING THE IRREGULARLY ACQUIRED POSSESSIONS IN A SEEMLY MANNER
TEMPERED IN VARYING DEGREE BY THE INSTINCT OF WORKMANSHIP TO THOSE NORMS IS TO BE ADDED ANOTHER BROAD PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THE PREDATORY ANIMUS WHICH IN POINT OF GENERALITY AND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTENT LIES BETWEEN THE TWO JUST NAMED
FOR EDIFICATION OR IN APPEAL TO THE DEVOUT FANCY THE DEVOUT WORD PAINTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE BRINGS OUT BEFORE HIS AUDITORS IMAGINATION A THRONE WITH A PROFUSION OF THE INSIGNIA OF OPULENCE AND POWER AND SURROUNDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF SERVITORS
THESE WILL ESPECIALLY HAVE MUCH TO SAY IN SHAPING THE FORM AND DIRECTION IN WHICH THE NEW ACCESSION TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S AGGREGATE FORCE WILL ASSERT ITSELF THAT IS TO SAY IN CONCRETE TERMS IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION IS AN ELEMENT OF THE SCHEME OF LIFE
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE STANDARD OF EXPENDITURE WHICH COMMONLY GUIDES OUR EFFORTS IS NOT THE AVERAGE ORDINARY EXPENDITURE ALREADY ACHIEVED IT IS AN IDEAL OF CONSUMPTION THAT LIES JUST BEYOND OUR REACH OR TO REACH WHICH REQUIRES SOME STRAIN
CHAPTER FIVE THE PECUNIARY STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN ANY MODERN COMMUNITY THE PROXIMATE GROUND OF EXPENDITURE IN EXCESS OF WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR PHYSICAL COMFORT
WHEN A GIVEN SET OF STIMULI HAVE COME TO BE HABITUALLY RESPONDED TO IN ACTIVITY OF A GIVEN KIND AND DIRECTION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THESE ALERT AND DEEP REACHING PROPENSITIES OF EMULATION IT IS WITH EXTREME RELUCTANCE THAT SUCH AN HABITUAL EXPENDITURE IS GIVEN UP
SERVICEABILITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AN INVIDIOUS COMPARISON IN PECUNIARY SUCCESS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE CANONS OF EXPENDITURE HAVE MUCH TO SAY IN DETERMINING THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR ANY COMMUNITY AND FOR ANY CLASS
THROUGH HIS HABITUALLY CONTEMPLATING IT AND ASSIMILATING THE SCHEME OF LIFE IN WHICH IT BELONGS BUT IT DOES SO ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH POPULAR INSISTENCE ON CONFORMITY TO THE ACCEPTED SCALE OF EXPENDITURE AS A MATTER OF PROPRIETY UNDER PAIN OF DISESTEEM AND OSTRACISM
THAT WHILE THE REGULATING NORM OF CONSUMPTION IS IN LARGE PART THE REQUIREMENT OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IT MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MOTIVE ON WHICH THE CONSUMER ACTS IN ANY GIVEN CASE IS THIS PRINCIPLE IN ITS BALD UNSOPHISTICATED FORM
REHEARSAL OF THE MERITORIOUS CHARACTERISTICS AND EXPLOITS OF THE DIVINITY WHILE THE BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENTATION IS FILLED WITH THE SHIMMER OF THE PRECIOUS METALS AND OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE VARIETIES OF PRECIOUS STONES
BACKED BY THE PRINCIPLE THAT VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION SHOULD CONSPICUOUSLY NOT CONDUCE TO THE COMFORT OF THE VICARIOUS CONSUMER
IN THE ESCHATOLOGICAL SENSE OR OF GOOD REPUTE MAY IN SOME CASES TAKE PRECEDENCE OF THE LOWER OR MORE ELEMENTARY WANTS IN GENERAL THE LONGER THE HABITUATION THE MORE UNBROKEN THE HABIT AND THE MORE NEARLY IT COINCIDES WITH PREVIOUS HABITUAL FORMS OF THE LIFE PROCESS
AND ESPECIALLY IT TAKES TIME TO CHANGE THE HABITS OF THOSE CLASSES THAT ARE SOCIALLY MORE REMOTE FROM THE RADIANT BODY THE PROCESS IS SLOWER WHERE THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS LESS OR WHERE THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THE SEVERAL CLASSES ARE WIDER AND MORE ABRUPT
REQUIRED IN THE REPUTABLE MAINTENANCE OF A CHILD IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND ACTS AS A POWERFUL DETERRENT
THERE NEEDS NO INSISTENCE OR ILLUSTRATION TO GAIN ASSENT TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE HABIT OF HOLDING PRIVATE PROPERTY INVIOLATE IS TRAVERSED BY THE OTHER HABIT OF SEEKING WEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD REPUTE TO BE GAINED THROUGH ITS CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION
ORDINARILY HIS MOTIVE IS A WISH TO CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED USAGE TO AVOID UNFAVORABLE NOTICE AND COMMENT TO LIVE UP TO THE ACCEPTED CANONS OF DECENCY IN THE KIND AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED
OR THE PARTICULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE CANON OF HONORIFIC EXPENDITURE HABITUALLY TRAVERSES THE CANONS OF MORAL CONDUCT THE MATTER IS ONE WHICH HAS RECEIVED LARGE ATTENTION AND ILLUSTRATION AT THE HANDS OF THOSE WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO WATCH AND ADMONISH WITH RESPECT TO ANY DEPARTURES
AND TO DISCOUNTENANCE WORK THAT BRINGS NO PECUNIARY GAIN AT THE SAME TIME THE EFFECT ON CONSUMPTION IS TO CONCENTRATE IT UPON THE LINES WHICH ARE MOST PATENT TO THE OBSERVERS WHOSE GOOD OPINION IS SOUGHT
FROM THE ACCEPTED CODE OF MORALS IN MODERN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FEATURE OF THE COMMUNITY'S LIFE IS THE INSTITUTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ONE OF THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CODE OF MORALS IS THE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY
OF WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT IN LIFE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS ALSO IN THE ORGANIC COMPLEX OF HABITS OF THOUGHT WHICH MAKE UP THE SUBSTANCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONSCIOUS LIFE THE ECONOMIC INTEREST DOES NOT LIE ISOLATED AND DISTINCT FROM ALL OTHER INTERESTS
THAN THE DWELLING HOUSES OF THE CONGREGATION THIS IS TRUE OF NEARLY ALL DENOMINATIONS AND CULTS WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR PAGAN BUT IT IS TRUE IN A PECULIAR DEGREE OF THE OLDER AND MATURER CULTS
AND IT CONSEQUENTLY LEAVES AN EXCEPTIONALLY NARROW MARGIN DISPOSABLE FOR THE OTHER ENDS OF LIFE BY FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR HABITUAL SENSE OF WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT IN THESE MATTERS AS WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE WAY OF PECUNIARY DECENCY AMONG THE LEARNED
SO THE CANON OF HONORIFIC WASTE MAY IMMEDIATELY OR REMOTELY INFLUENCE THE SENSE OF DUTY THE SENSE OF BEAUTY THE SENSE OF UTILITY THE SENSE OF DEVOTIONAL OR RITUALISTIC FITNESS AND THE SCIENTIFIC SENSE OF TRUTH
AND THE PREVALENT TYPE OF TRANSMITTED APTITUDES OR IN OTHER WORDS THE TYPE OF TEMPERAMENT BELONGING TO THE DOMINANT ETHNIC ELEMENT IN ANY COMMUNITY WILL GO FAR TO DECIDE WHAT WILL BE THE SCOPE AND FORM OF EXPRESSION OF THE COMMUNITY'S HABITUAL LIFE PROCESS
THERE SHOULD BE NO SHOW OF AGILITY OR OF DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PRIESTLY OFFICE SUCH AS MIGHT SUGGEST A CAPACITY FOR TURNING OFF THE WORK
ALTHOUGH IN THE FORMER CASE THE DIFFICULTY IS A MORAL ONE WHILE IN THE LATTER IT MAY INVOLVE A MATERIAL DEDUCTION FROM THE PHYSICAL COMFORTS OF LIFE BUT WHILE RETROGRESSION IS DIFFICULT A FRESH ADVANCE IN CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE IS RELATIVELY EASY
IN THE SOCIAL SCALE WHILE IT RARELY COMPARES ITSELF WITH THOSE BELOW OR WITH THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE THAT IS TO SAY IN OTHER WORDS OUR STANDARD OF DECENCY IN EXPENDITURE AS IN OTHER ENDS OF EMULATION
BUT IF TIME BE ALLOWED THE SCOPE OF THE DISCRETION OF THE LEISURE CLASS AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF FORM AND DETAIL IN THE COMMUNITY'S SCHEME OF LIFE IS LARGE WHILE AS REGARDS THE SUBSTANTIAL PRINCIPLES OF REPUTABILITY THE CHANGES WHICH IT CAN EFFECT LIE WITHIN A NARROW MARGIN OF TOLERANCE
IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SCRUPULOUSLY SCREENED AND MASKED UNDER AN OSTENSIBLE AUSTERITY IN THE MOST REPUTABLE LATTER DAY HOUSES OF WORSHIP WHERE NO EXPENSE IS SPARED THE PRINCIPLE OF AUSTERITY IS CARRIED TO THE LENGTH OF MAKING THE FITTINGS OF THE PLACE A MEANS OF MORTIFYING THE FLESH
HENCE THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF PEOPLE AS REGARDS THEIR DOMESTIC LIFE IN MOST OF THE INDUSTRIALLY DEVELOPED COMMUNITIES AND HENCE BY REMOTER DERIVATION THE HABIT OF PRIVACY AND RESERVE THAT IS SO LARGE A FEATURE IN THE CODE OF PROPRIETIES OF THE BETTER CLASS IN ALL COMMUNITIES
THE EFFECT OF THIS FACTOR OF THE STANDARD OF LIVING BOTH IN THE WAY OF RETRENCHMENT IN THE OBSCURER ELEMENTS OF CONSUMPTION THAT GO TO PHYSICAL COMFORT AND MAINTENANCE AND ALSO IN THE PAUCITY OR ABSENCE OF CHILDREN
IN AN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THIS PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION EXPRESSES ITSELF IN PECUNIARY EMULATION AND THIS SO FAR AS REGARDS THE WESTERN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES OF THE PRESENT IS VIRTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT EXPRESSES ITSELF IN SOME FORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
IN SO DOING THIS PRINCIPLE WILL TRAVERSE OTHER NORMS OF CONDUCT WHICH DO NOT PRIMARILY HAVE TO DO WITH THE CODE OF PECUNIARY HONOR BUT WHICH HAVE DIRECTLY OR INCIDENTALLY AN ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SOME MAGNITUDE
THE MOTIVE IS EMULATION THE STIMULUS OF AN INVIDIOUS COMPARISON WHICH PROMPTS US TO OUTDO THOSE WITH WHOM WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF CLASSING OURSELVES
THAT IT WAS SILLY TO SHOW OFF AND NOW THE REAL STORY PART OF MY STORY BEGINS HE MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIFES HE MARRIED NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES
YES I KNOW LITTLE BROTHER
FOR SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER OWN EMOTIONS HAPPY ONES NOW TO JUDGE FROM THE SMILE THAT SHONE IN HER EYES AND THE DECIDED GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE PUT THE LITTLE BUD IN HER BOSOM AS IF SHE SAID HE DESERVES SOME REWARD FOR THAT GOOD DEED
AND WAS WILLING TO WORK AND WAIT WITH AND FOR MY JOHN SO SHE WILL BE AND I HOPE THEY WILL FIND IT OUT BUT SHE IS SO DUTIFUL AND GOOD I'M AFRAID SHE WON'T LET HERSELF BE HAPPY YOU WOULD LIKE IT MOTHER HEARTILY
AND SHE PICKED UP HER COURAGE WITH BOTH WINGS AND SAID O QUEEN BE LOVELY FOR EVER YOU KNOW WHAT MEN FOLK ARE LIKE
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WENT OUT FOR PEACE AND QUIET AS USUAL AND AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HE MET BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VERY SORROWFUL BECAUSE SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS SO WORRIED AND SHE SAID TO HIM O MY LORD AND LIGHT OF MY EYES
DRAMATIC SITUATIONS AND FEMININE WONDER AS TO WHETHER THE LOVELY CREATURES WOULD WEAR THEIR VEILS OR NOT SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE A GREAT BUSH OF WHITE ROSES
O MY LORD AND REGENT OF MY EXISTENCE I HID BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAW IT ALL IT WAS I WHO TOLD THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE TO ASK THE BUTTERFLY TO STAMP
CHARMED TO HAVE A FINGER IN THIS ROMANTIC PIE JOSIE TIED A GRACEFUL BOW OF RIBBON ABOUT THE STEMS
AND THE STILLNESS OF SUMMER TWILIGHT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP HEARING AND IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FOR THEY WERE TALKING OF JOHN SO NICE OF LUDMILLA TO BRING US ALL BOTTLES OF REAL GERMAN COLOGNE
WHERE I COME FROM WE EACH EAT TWICE AS MUCH AS THAT BETWEEN MEALS THEN SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE AND SAID O ANIMAL I GAVE THAT DINNER TO SHOW WHAT A GREAT AND RICH KING I WAS
IT HAS ALSO DELIVERED ME FROM THE VEXATIONS OF MY VEXATIOUS WIVES TELL ME THEREFORE O MY LADY AND HEART OF MY HEART HOW DID YOU COME TO BE SO WISE
WHAT ARE YOU AT HERE MISCHIEF ASKED DEMI WITH AN IRVINGESQUE START AS HE FELT RATHER THAN SAW A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN HIS DAY DREAM GETTING FLOWERS FOR OUR BRIDES
HE LEANED BACK ALL WEAK AND HICCOUGHY AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID O GREAT WIZARD WHAT IS THE SENSE OF RETURNING TO ME MY PALACE IF AT THE SAME TIME YOU SLAY ME WITH MIRTH
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS STRONG
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD MUST BE DEAD AND WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW WAS THE EARTH THUNDERING AND DARKENING AT THE NEWS THEN BALKIS BECKONED THAT BOLD QUEEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SAID TO HER AND TO THE OTHERS COME AND SEE
DAISY I'VE BEEN LONGING TO TELL YOU WHAT HE DID WITH HIS MONEY HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT AND I'VE HAD NO TIME SINCE TO TELL YOU HE SENT POOR YOUNG BARTON TO THE HOSPITAL AND KEPT HIM THERE TILL HIS EYES WERE SAVED A COSTLY THING TO DO
WHAT WILL YOU DO AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID O MY LADY AND CONTENT OF MY HEART I SHALL CONTINUE TO ENDURE MY FATE AT THE HANDS OF THESE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE QUEENS WHO VEX ME WITH THEIR CONTINUAL QUARRELLING
AND NOT BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO BE KIND TO THE ANIMALS NOW I AM ASHAMED AND IT SERVES ME RIGHT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS A REALLY TRULY WISE MAN BEST BELOVED AFTER THAT HE NEVER FORGOT
I THINK I'LL WRITE HE WAS SLOWLY BEGINNING AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH BOTH WERE TRYING TO STRIKE OUT A NEW AND BRILLIANT IDEA I'VE GOT IT PERFECTLY LOVELY JUST SUIT HER AND YOU TOO BEING A POET CRIED JOSIE WITH A SKIP WHAT IS IT
LITTLE BUT I THINK HIS FIRST INVESTMENT A SAFE AND GOOD ONE FOR HE WHO GIVETH TO THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD AND I WAS SO PLEASED AND PROUD I WOULDN'T SPOIL IT BY OFFERING HIM A PENNY
AND LAY ON THE TOILETTE TABLES OF THE NEW COUSINS AS A DELICATE ATTENTION A STEP STARTLED HER AND LOOKING UP SHE SAW HER BROTHER COMING DOWN THE PATH WITH FOLDED ARMS BENT HEAD
DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE ANSWERED JOSIE TO WHOM THE WORD MISCHIEF SUGGESTED HER FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT A BRIDE OR A FLOWER ASKED DEMI CALMLY THOUGH HE EYED THE BLOOMING BUSH AS IF IT HAD A SUDDEN AND UNUSUAL INTEREST FOR HIM
THEN THEY WENT UP TO THE PALACE AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS
THAT IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE HE FOUND BREATH ENOUGH TO WHISPER TO THE BUTTERFLY STAMP AGAIN LITTLE BROTHER GIVE ME BACK MY PALACE MOST GREAT MAGICIAN YES GIVE HIM BACK HIS PALACE SAID THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE STILL FLYING ABOUT IN THE DARK LIKE A MOTH
AND THEY HEARD HIM SAY O WIFE OF MY BROTHER IN THE AIR REMEMBER AFTER THIS TO PLEASE YOUR HUSBAND IN ALL THINGS LEST HE BE PROVOKED TO STAMP HIS FOOT YET AGAIN FOR HE HAS SAID THAT HE IS USED TO THIS MAGIC
AND LOOKED AWAY AS IF SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SEE THE DAWN OF THE GREAT PASSION WHICH WHILE IT LASTS MAKES A YOUNG MAN AS HAPPY AS A GOD DO IT WAS ALL HE SAID AND GATHERED A FULL BLOWN ROSE TO FINISH HIS FLORAL LOVE MESSAGE
IT IS HIS HAVING NOTHING TO OFFER THAT KEEPS HIM SILENT I THINK HE IS SO HONEST
NOR THE TEARS AND SMILES AND BLUSHES THAT CAME AND WENT AS SHE READ THE NOTE AND PONDERED WHAT ANSWER SHE SHOULD GIVE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE ONE SHE WISHED TO GIVE BUT DUTY HELD HER BACK
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S VERY BEST BELOVED
AS SHE SAT LOOKING SADLY DOWN ON THE SYMBOLS OF AN AFFECTION THAT GREW DEARER EVERY MOMENT SHE LISTENED HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE MURMUR OF VOICES IN THE ADJOINING ROOM OPEN WINDOWS THIN PARTITIONS
AND THE RIVERS OF THE GOLD OF THE SOUTH FROM THE DESERT OF ZINN TO THE TOWERS OF ZIMBABWE
AND HE SHALL HAVE IT MISSUS MEG WAS SPEAKING AND STILL OF JOHN WHEN SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT UNWISE AND RECKLESS
A BROTHERLY FEELING OF SYMPATHY HAD KEPT HIM FROM TELLING HER HIS HOPES BECAUSE HER OWN WERE FORBIDDEN HIS MOTHER WAS RATHER JEALOUS OF ANY GIRL HE ADMIRED BUT KNOWING THAT SHE LIKED ALICE HE LOVED ON AND ENJOYED HIS SECRET ALONE
THEY CAME DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND BENEATH HIS CAMPHOR TREE STILL WEAK WITH LAUGHING THEY SAW THE MOST WISE KING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE SMILED BECAUSE HER OWN TRUE LOVE WAS SO JOYFUL PRESENTLY THE BUTTERFLY VERY HOT AND PUFFY CAME WHIRLING BACK UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAID TO SULEIMAN SHE WANTS ME TO STAMP
AND SHE HELD OUT HER FINGER AND WHISPERED SOFTLY TO THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE LITTLE WOMAN COME HERE
BUT BALKIS HID AMONG THE TALL IRISES AND THE SPOTTED BAMBOOS AND THE RED LILLIES BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE
WHILE DEMI WROTE UPON A CARD DEAR ALICE YOU KNOW WHAT THE FLOWERS MEAN WILL YOU WEAR ONE OR ALL TONIGHT AND MAKE ME STILL PROUDER FONDER AND HAPPIER THAN I AM YOURS ENTIRELY JOHN
AND WE ARE MOST EXTREMELY TROUBLED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT TROUBLE FOR IT WAS A TROUBLESOME TROUBLE UNLIKE ANY TROUBLE WE HAVE KNOWN
AND THEN SHE RAN AWAY TO DO HER GENTLE SPIRITING LIKE ARIEL LEAVING DEMI TO DREAM AMONG THE ROSES LIKE FERDINAND MARY AND LUDMILLA WERE CHARMED WITH THEIR BOUQUETS AND THE GIVER HAD THE DELIGHT OF PUTTING SOME OF THE FLOWERS INTO THE DARK HAIR
AS I MADE THAT FEAST FOR ALL THE ANIMALS I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAME BUT BY MEANS OF YOUR WISDOM I MADE THE MAGIC FOR THE SAKE OF A JEST AND FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE BUTTERFLY AND BEHOLD
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD PRESENTLY TWO BUTTERFLIES FLEW UNDER THE TREE QUARRELLING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD HEARD ONE SAY TO THE OTHER I WONDER AT YOUR PRESUMPTION IN TALKING LIKE THIS TO ME DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF I STAMPED WITH MY FOOT
FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE O QUEENS THEY STOOD ON THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND SHOUTED WHAT IS OUR TROUBLE WE WERE LIVING PEACEFULLY IN OUR GOLDEN PALACE AS IS OUR CUSTOM
WHEN THEY BOWED IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND GROANED AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE TREES SAID WHEN THEY RUSTLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING FROM THE BISHOP ON THE BENCH TO THE HYSSOP ON THE WALL
FROM HERE TO THE WIDE WORLD'S END
I'M USED TO THIS KIND OF THING BUT AS A FAVOUR TO YOU AND TO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD I DON'T MIND PUTTING THINGS RIGHT SO HE STAMPED ONCE MORE AND THAT INSTANT THE DJINNS LET DOWN THE PALACE AND THE GARDENS WITHOUT EVEN A BUMP
SUPPOSE YOU STAMP NOW I PROMISED SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD THAT I WOULDN'T SAID THE BUTTERFLY AND I DON'T WANT TO BREAK MY PROMISE IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU DID SAID HIS WIFE
BUT SOME WERE SIMPLY HORRID AND THE HORRID ONES QUARRELLED WITH THE NICE ONES AND MADE THEM HORRID TOO AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL QUARREL WITH SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND THAT WAS HORRID FOR HIM
AND THEY ALL LIVED IN A GREAT GOLDEN PALACE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOVELY GARDEN WITH FOUNTAINS HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES BUT IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIVES
SHE WANTS TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN O SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO IT AND NOW SHE'LL NEVER BELIEVE A WORD I SAY SHE'LL LAUGH AT ME TO THE END OF MY DAYS NO LITTLE BROTHER SAID SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
AND THE LIGHT AS SHE PLAYED MAID AT THE TOILETTES OF OUR BRIDES WHICH CONSOLED HER FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MATTER OF VEILS NO ONE HELPED ALICE DRESS FOR DAISY WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM WITH HER MOTHER
TILL THE CAMPHOR TREE SHOOK AT THE BUTTERFLY'S BOAST AND HE HELD OUT HIS FINGER AND SAID LITTLE MAN COME HERE THE BUTTERFLY WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED BUT HE MANAGED TO FLY UP TO THE HAND OF SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND CLUNG THERE FANNING HIMSELF
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN EVER AND SAID O ANIMAL YOU HAVE EATEN ALL THE DINNER THAT I MADE READY FOR ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE WORLD AND THE ANIMAL SAID O KING LIVE FOR EVER BUT DO YOU REALLY CALL THAT A DINNER
IN PLAYS THE LOVERS GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES BUT THAT'S AWKWARD WHEN THEY HAVE LONG LEGS TED NEVER DOES IT WELL THOUGH I DRILL HIM FOR HOURS YOU COULD SAY BE MINE BE MINE LIKE THE OLD MAN WHO THREW CUCUMBERS OVER THE WALL TO MISSUS NICKLEBY
AND SHE WOULD DO HER DUTY BETTER PERHAPS IF NO IMPATIENT LOVER WAITED FOR HER WITH EYES THAT SAW BUT DIMLY AND A HAND THAT LINGERED ON THE STEM HE HAD STRIPPED OF THORNS SHE LAID THE HALF BLOWN FLOWER BY THE ROSE AND ASKED HERSELF
FOR A BETTER NOBLER GIRL DOESN'T LIVE SHE IS ALL I WANT FOR MY SON
AND THE ORATION TODAY HAD FILLED HIM WITH TENDER PRIDE BUT THE SIGHT OF THOSE BLOOMING BRIDES AND BEAMING GROOMS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE PANTED TO SECURE HIS ALICE WITHOUT AN HOUR'S DELAY DAISY WAS HIS CONFIDANTE IN ALL THINGS BUT THIS
LOOKED UP INTO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S EYES AND PUT HER HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE JUST LIKE THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID FIRST O MY LORD BECAUSE I LOVED YOU AND SECONDLY O MY LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WOMEN FOLK ARE
I SAID THAT TO QUIET HER AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID
AND IT HAS IN A MANNER BEEN SHUT UP EVER SINCE TILL MY LORD THE COUNT CAME HERE THE DEATH OF THE MARCHIONESS APPEARS EXTRAORDINARY SAID EMILY WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW MORE THAN SHE DARED TO ASK YES MADAM REPLIED DOROTHEE IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY
AND AN HOUR PERHAPS UPON LORNA AND ME WE MUST BOTH HAVE WEARIED OF HIM AND REQUIRED CHANGE OF AIR BUT NOW I LONGED TO SEE AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT HIM AND HOPED THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO TO HEAVEN FOR AT LEAST A WEEK OR MORE HOWEVER
AND NOW LADY I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THIS SAD HISTORY AND ALL MY THOUGHTS AND YOU HAVE PROMISED YOU KNOW NEVER TO GIVE THE LEAST HINT ABOUT
RECEIVED NOTICE TO GO FOR MY LORD WENT TO THE WARS I NEVER SAW HIM AFTER FOR HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE CHATEAU THOUGH IT IS SUCH A FINE PLACE AND NEVER FINISHED THOSE FINE ROOMS HE WAS BUILDING ON THE WEST SIDE OF IT
THAT MONTONI HAD LATELY SHEWN HOW CAPABLE HE WAS OF ADDING TO ITS STRENGTH ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE SKILL OF A COMMANDER THAT SO CONSIDERABLE A BODY OF TROOPS AS THAT ALLOTTED TO THE EXPEDITION COULD NOT APPROACH UDOLPHO WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE
EXCEPT BY ONE VERY FEEBLE NOD THAT SHE WAS DOING WHAT HE WISHED THEN SHE GAVE TO ME THE TRINKET FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND I STOWED IT IN MY BREAST HE SEEMED TO ME TO FOLLOW THIS AND TO BE WELL CONTENT WITH IT
O I WELL REMEMBER HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WE SERVANTS WERE ALL ASSEMBLED TO WELCOME HER AND HOW HAPPY MY LORD THE MARQUIS SEEMED AH WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEN BUT
THAT MY HEART HAS OFTEN ACHED TO SEE IT BUT HE USED TO BE STUBBORN AND GIVE HER HARSH ANSWERS
FOR SHE WAS MUCH AFFECTED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE LATE MARCHIONESS AND BY THE MEEK PATIENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD SUFFERED WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME RESUMED DOROTHEE ALAS HE CAME TOO LATE
BUT AS I SAID MADAM CONTINUED DOROTHEE WHEN FIRST I HEARD THE MUSIC THAT CAME JUST NOW I THOUGHT IT WAS MY LATE LADY'S AND I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AGAIN WHEN I HAVE HEARD IT AS I HAVE DONE AT INTERVALS EVER SINCE
A LAWYER PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE ARGUED IT NOT BUT WHAT HE MAY HAVE MEANT TO BESTOW ON US HIS BLESSING ONLY THAT HE DIED NEXT DAY WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE TO DO IT HE CALLED INDEED FOR HIS BOX OF SNUFF
SOMETIMES MANY MONTHS HAVE GONE BY BUT STILL IT HAS RETURNED IT IS EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVED EMILY THAT NO PERSON HAS YET DISCOVERED THE MUSICIAN
WHILE ALL THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM WAS GRISLY LIKE THE HEART OF A MOULDY OAT RICK I WENT TO THE WINDOW AT ONCE OF COURSE
BUT EMILY REMINDED HER THAT THE COUNT HAD TALKED THE OTHER DAY OF ORDERING THEM TO BE OPENED OF WHICH DOROTHEE SEEMED TO CONSIDER MUCH AND THEN SHE OWNED
ALL THE SKY WAS BANKED WITH DARKNESS HARD AUSTERE AND FROWNING THE FOG OF THE LAST THREE WEEKS WAS GONE NEITHER DID ANY RIME REMAIN BUT ALL THINGS HAD A LOOK OF SAMENESS AND A KIND OF FURZY COLOUR
THE STRONG MEN BROKE THREE GOOD PICKAXES ERE THEY GOT THROUGH THE HARD BROWN SOD STREAKED WITH LITTLE MAPS OF GRAY WHERE OLD SIR ENSOR WAS TO LIE UPON HIS BACK AWAITING THE DARKNESS OF THE JUDGMENT DAY
BEFORE SIR ENSOR DOONE WAS BURIED THE GREATEST FROST OF THE CENTURY HAD SET IN WITH ITS IRON HAND AND STEP OF STONE ON EVERYTHING HOW IT CAME IS NOT MY BUSINESS NOR CAN I EXPLAIN IT
AND THIS NOT ONLY FROM FEAR LEST ONE MORE WICKED MIGHT SUCCEED HIM AS APPEARED INDEED TOO PROBABLE BUT FROM TRUE ADMIRATION OF HIS STRONG WILL AND SYMPATHY WITH HIS MISFORTUNES
I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF IT NOW
WITH A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HEAVE AN ASH TREE UP THE CHIMNEY PLACE AND THAT WAS HOW THE BIRDS WERE GOING RATHER THAN FLYING AS THEY USED TO FLY ALL THE BIRDS WERE SET IN ONE DIRECTION STEADILY JOURNEYING WESTWARD
WERE SOON LOST IN NEARER INTERESTS THAN ANY WHICH THE UNHAPPY EMILY HAD AWAKENED HIS DEPREDATIONS HAVING EXCEEDED THEIR USUAL LIMITS AND REACHED AN EXTENT AT WHICH NEITHER THE TIMIDITY OF THE THEN COMMERCIAL SENATE OF VENICE
UNLESS HE CAME IN FIVE MINUTES NOT THAT HE COULD DO MUCH GOOD BUT BECAUSE THE OTHER MEN WOULD BE SURE TO SKULK IF HE SET THEM THE EXAMPLE
WHICH WAS A VERY HIGH THING TO TAKE AND WHICH HE NEVER TOOK WITHOUT BEING IN VERY GOOD HUMOUR AT LEAST FOR HIM AND THOUGH IT WOULD NOT GO UP HIS NOSTRILS THROUGH THE FAILURE OF HIS BREATH HE WAS PLEASED TO HAVE IT THERE AND NOT TO THINK OF DYING
BUT I UNDERSTOOD HIM TOO WELL HOWEVER I KEPT MY REMARKS TO MYSELF AND ONLY TOLD THEM TO MY HUSBAND WHO BADE ME HOLD MY TONGUE SOME OF THE OTHER SERVANTS HOWEVER SUSPECTED WHAT I DID AND STRANGE REPORTS WERE WHISPERED ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WITH WHICH THIS WHOLE TRANSACTION WAS COMPLETED PREVENTED IT FROM ATTRACTING CURIOSITY OR EVEN FROM OBTAINING A PLACE IN ANY OF THE PUBLISHED RECORDS OF THAT TIME SO THAT EMILY
AND MY LADY MORE THOUGHTFUL AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT THIS WAS THE CHEVALIER SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED BUT I NEVER COULD LEARN FOR CERTAIN WHAT WAS THE CHEVALIER'S NAME DOROTHEE SAID EMILY
PARTRIDGES THAT CAME TO HAND WITH A DRY NOISE IN THEIR CROPS HEATH POULTS MAKING CUPS OF SNOW AND A FEW POOR HOPPING REDWINGS FLIPPING IN AND OUT THE HEDGE HAVING LOST THE POWER TO FLY
AND IT GREATLY KEPT MY SPIRITS DOWN ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SO VERY MUCH FRIGHTEN ME FOR IT TAKES A MAN BUT A LITTLE WHILE HIS INSTINCT BEING OF DEATH PERHAPS
AND THUS ENDEAVOURED GRADUALLY TO WITHDRAW HER FROM THE SUBJECT OF HER GRIEF AND TO AWAKE OTHER INTERESTS IN HER MIND EMILY TO WHOM HE APPEARED AS THE ENLIGHTENED FRIEND AND PROTECTOR OF HER YOUTH SOON FELT FOR HIM THE TENDER AFFECTION OF A DAUGHTER
I DID NOT DARE THEN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER
AND ALL THE SEED SHE COULD THINK OF AND LUMPS OF ROTTEN APPLES
BUT SHE REQUESTED THAT DOROTHEE WOULD RETURN ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE OBSERVED AND CONDUCT HER THITHER BESIDES HER WISH TO EXAMINE THE PORTRAIT SHE FELT A THRILLING CURIOSITY TO SEE THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE MARCHIONESS HAD DIED
IT WAS VERY BECOMING TRULY MY LORD THE MARQUIS NOTICED ME
INDULGING MELANCHOLY REVERIES WHICH THE LONELINESS OF THE HOUR ASSISTED THE STILLNESS WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED NOT BY MUSIC BUT BY VERY UNCOMMON SOUNDS THAT SEEMED TO COME EITHER FROM THE ROOM ADJOINING HER OWN OR FROM ONE BELOW
NOT WITH ANY HEAT OF SPEED NEITHER FLYING FAR AT ONCE BUT ALL AS IF ON BUSINESS BOUND PARTLY RUNNING PARTLY FLYING PARTLY FLUTTERING ALONG
IT WAS LONG BEFORE SHE COULD SUFFICIENTLY ABSTRACT HER MIND FROM VALANCOURT TO LISTEN TO THE STORY PROMISED BY OLD DOROTHEE
AND INDEED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IN ME TO HAVE KEPT AWAY ALTOGETHER FOR NOW THERE WAS NO ONE TO PROTECT ME AMONG THOSE WILD AND LAWLESS MEN AND BOTH CARVER AND THE COUNSELLOR HAD VOWED A FEARFUL VENGEANCE ON ME AS I HEARD FROM GWENNY
HE SAID THAT HE HAD KNOWN A FROST BEGINNING JUST AS THIS HAD DONE WITH A BLACK EAST WIND AFTER DAYS OF RAW COLD FOG AND THEN ON THE THIRD NIGHT OF THE FROST AT THIS VERY TIME OF YEAR
AYE MA'AMSELLE IF IT HAD BEEN ANY THING EARTHLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED LONG AGO BUT WHO COULD HAVE COURAGE TO FOLLOW A SPIRIT AND IF THEY HAD WHAT GOOD COULD IT DO FOR SPIRITS YOU KNOW MA'AM CAN TAKE ANY SHAPE OR NO SHAPE AND THEY WILL BE HERE ONE MINUTE
IT STRUCK ME AS I LAY IN BED THAT WE WERE ACTING FOOLISHLY FOR AN ANCIENT SHEPHERD HAD DROPPED IN AND TAKEN SUPPER WITH US AND FORETOLD A HEAVY FALL AND GREAT DISASTER TO LIVE STOCK
WHY THAT I WILL NOT TELL EVEN TO YOU MA'AMSELLE FOR EVIL MAY COME OF IT I ONCE HEARD FROM A PERSON WHO IS SINCE DEAD THAT THE MARCHIONESS WAS NOT IN LAW THE WIFE OF THE MARQUIS FOR THAT SHE HAD BEFORE BEEN PRIVATELY MARRIED TO THE GENTLEMAN
DEPRESSED BY SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT CHEERFUL OBJECTS RATHER ADDED TO THAN REMOVED THIS DEPRESSION BUT PERHAPS SHE YIELDED TOO MUCH TO HER MELANCHOLY INCLINATION AND IMPRUDENTLY LAMENTED THE MISFORTUNE
BUT THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT REMAINED LONG UNBROKEN EXCEPT BY THE MURMURING SOUNDS OF THE WOODS AS THEY WAVED IN THE BREEZE AND THEN BY THE DISTANT BELL OF THE CONVENT STRIKING ONE SHE NOW WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW AND AS SHE SAT AT HER BED SIDE
WORDS THE LIVING WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SPRINKLING WITH HIS LITTLE BROOM DROPS THAT COULD NOT PURIFY WHILE THE CHILDREN ROBED IN WHITE SWUNG THEIR SMOKING CENSERS SLOWLY OVER THE COLD AND TWILIGHT GRAVE
WHEN ONLY WE TWO WERE WITH HIM HE LOOKED AT US BOTH VERY DIMLY AND SOFTLY AS IF HE WISHED TO DO SOMETHING FOR US BUT HAD LEFT IT NOW TOO LATE LORNA HOPED THAT HE WANTED TO BLESS US
YET HOW MANY HAVE DONE EVIL WHILE RECEIVING ONLY GOOD
WHILE A CORPS OF CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH WAS UPON THE POINT OF RECEIVING ORDERS TO MARCH FOR UDOLPHO A YOUNG OFFICER PROMPTED PARTLY BY RESENTMENT FOR SOME INJURY RECEIVED FROM MONTONI AND PARTLY BY THE HOPE OF DISTINCTION
FOR I SUPPOSED HE HAD FORGOT TO DO SO IN HIS GRIEF BUT MY LADY SAID IT WAS THEN TOO LATE BUT MY LORD SO FAR FROM THINKING SO SEEMED TO THINK LIGHT OF HER DISORDER
BUT MY LORD ALL OF A SUDDEN GREW GLOOMY AND FRETFUL AND VERY UNKIND SOMETIMES TO MY LADY THIS AFFLICTED HER VERY MUCH AS I SAW FOR SHE NEVER COMPLAINED AND SHE USED TO TRY SO SWEETLY TO OBLIGE HIM AND TO BRING HIM INTO A GOOD HUMOUR
SUCH AS I HAD SEEN HER WHEN SHE WAS DYING AND ONCE OR TWICE I ALMOST THOUGHT I SAW HER BEFORE ME WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD SUCH SWEET MUSIC IT SEEMED JUST AT MY WINDOW AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT
AND THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE HONOUR OF THE REPUBLIC TO HAVE A LARGE PART OF ITS REGULAR FORCE EMPLOYED FOR SUCH A TIME AS THE SIEGE OF UDOLPHO WOULD REQUIRE UPON THE ATTACK OF A HANDFUL OF BANDITTI
THE CONCLUSION OF HIS PLAN WAS SOON EFFECTED HAVING RETURNED WITH HIS PARTY WHO RECEIVED THE WATCH WORD AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR FRIENDS WITHIN MONTONI AND HIS OFFICERS WERE SURPRISED BY ONE DIVISION WHO HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THEIR APARTMENT
AND SHE SEEMED DISPLEASED SO I SAID NO MORE I FOUND OUT SOME TIME AFTER HOW IT WAS HER FATHER IT SEEMS HAD COMMANDED HER TO MARRY MY LORD THE MARQUIS FOR HIS MONEY AND THERE WAS ANOTHER NOBLEMAN OR ELSE A CHEVALIER THAT SHE LIKED BETTER
SOME GOT ON AND SOME DIED OFF
AND HER HEART EXPANDED TO HER YOUNG FRIEND BLANCHE AS TO A SISTER
ONE DOES NOT SO MUCH MIND ABOUT ONE'S FEARS BUT ALL THE SERVANTS WERE GONE TO BED AND I SAT THINKING AND THINKING TILL I WAS ALMOST AFRAID TO LOOK ROUND THE ROOM AND MY POOR LADY'S COUNTENANCE OFTEN CAME TO MY MIND
THAN OTHERWISE AND AT LENGTH PROMISED TO SHEW THE PICTURE THE NIGHT WAS TOO FAR ADVANCED AND EMILY WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THE NARRATIVE OF THE SCENES WHICH HAD PASSED IN THOSE APARTMENTS TO WISH TO VISIT THEM AT THIS HOUR
THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE THAT HAD BEEN RELATED TO HER TOGETHER WITH THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES SAID TO HAVE SINCE OCCURRED IN THE CHATEAU HAD SO MUCH SHOCKED HER SPIRITS THAT SHE NOW SUNK FOR A MOMENT UNDER THE WEAKNESS OF SUPERSTITION
SETTLED FOR EVER WITHOUT OUR VOTES LET US OWN THAT HE WAS AT LEAST
TO WIT ON THE FIFTEENTH OF DECEMBER SUCH A SNOW SET IN AS KILLED HALF OF THE SHEEP AND MANY EVEN OF THE RED DEER AND THE FOREST PONIES
YET WITH ALL HER LITTLE BREATH STEAMING ON THE AIR LIKE FROST I STOOD APART FROM THE CEREMONY IN WHICH OF COURSE I WAS NOT ENTITLED EITHER BY BIRTH OR RELIGION TO BEAR ANY PORTION
OR BY APPROACHING THE FORTRESS WITH THE SECRECY CONSISTENT WITH THE MARCH OF SMALLER BODIES OF TROOPS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE EITHER OF THE TREACHERY OR NEGLIGENCE OF SOME OF HIS PARTY AND TO RUSH UNEXPECTEDLY UPON THE WHOLE
HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AS WE SAY OF ALL PEOPLE WHO LEAVE IT AND I VERILY BELIEVE HIS HEART WAS NOT A BAD ONE AFTER ALL
YET NOW WITH HEADS DEVOUTLY BENT CLASPED HANDS AND DOWNCAST EYES FOLLOWING THE LONG BLACK COFFIN OF THEIR COMMON ANCESTOR TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY MUST JOIN HIM WHEN THEIR SUM OF ILL WAS DONE AND TO SEE THE FEEBLE PRIEST CHANTING OVER THE DEAD FORM
AND I STAID BY MY DEAR LADY AND DID WHAT I COULD TO EASE HER SUFFERINGS SHE HAD INTERVALS OF EASE AND IN ONE OF THESE SHE SENT FOR MY LORD AGAIN WHEN HE CAME I WAS GOING
MY LADY MARCHIONESS WAS THEN ABOUT YOUR AGE AND AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT VERY LIKE YOU
HE KNOWS THAT HIS OWN IS SURE TO COME AND NATURE IS FOND OF THE PRACTICE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT I AFTER EASING MY MOTHER'S FEARS AND SEEING A LITTLE TO BUSINESS RETURNED AS IF DRAWN BY A POLAR NEEDLE
THAT I ALMOST FANCIED I SAW HER AS SHE APPEARED UPON HER DEATH BED EMILY NOW DREW HER CHAIR NEAR TO DOROTHEE WHO WENT ON IT IS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS SINCE MY LADY MARCHIONESS CAME A BRIDE TO THE CHATEAU
OR THAT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH SUPERSTITIOUS AWE
AND TO LOOK UPON THIS DUSKY LANDSCAPE YOU WAS SPEAKING OF MY LORD THE MARQUIS WHEN THE MUSIC INTERRUPTED US YES MADAM MY LORD THE MARQUIS BECAME MORE AND MORE GLOOMY AND MY LADY GREW WORSE AND WORSE TILL ONE NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN VERY ILL INDEED
HE WENT INTO HIS LIBRARY AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR AND THERE HE STAID AND WOULD HEAR NO REASON THAT WAS TALKED TO HIM WHEN MY LADY RECOVERED SHE ENQUIRED FOR HIM BUT AFTERWARDS SAID SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIS GRIEF AND DESIRED WE WOULD LET HER DIE QUIETLY
HE FOR HIS PART NEVER ASKED FOR ANY ONE TO COME NEAR HIM NOT EVEN A PRIEST NOR A MONK OR FRIAR BUT SEEMED TO BE GOING HIS OWN WAY PEACEFUL AND WELL CONTENTED
DOROTHEE HOWEVER STEADILY REFUSED TO DO THIS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE NOTICE OF EMILY'S LIKENESS TO THE LATE MARCHIONESS THERE IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF HER ADDED SHE HANGING IN A ROOM OF THE SUITE WHICH WAS SHUT UP
THIS IS NO MORTAL BUSINESS NOR NO SOUND THAT THE EARTH OWES SHAKESPEARE WE NOW RETURN TO THE MENTION OF MONTONI WHOSE RAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THAT I ANSWERED HONEST MEN GENERALLY CONTRIVE TO BE HUNG FAR AWAY FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY AND AS A PROOF OF IT SIXTY FRENCHMEN HAVE BEEN HUNG IN THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR BETWEEN NAPLES ROME AND VENICE
THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED HER UPON HER MARRIAGE WITH HIM
WHO DID NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT TOWARDS THE END OF THE DINNER SOMEONE SPOKE OF THE RHINOCEROS WHICH WAS THEN SHEWN FOR TWENTY FOUR SOUS AT THE SAINT GERMAIN'S FAIR LET US GO AND SEE IT WAS THE CRY
AND THE ACADEMY OF PAINTING WAS UNDER HIS JURISDICTION I MENTIONED MY BROTHER TO HIM AND HE GRACIOUSLY PROMISED TO PROTECT HIM ANOTHER YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHO CONVERSED WITH ME INVITED ME TO VISIT HIM IT WAS THE DUKE DE MATALONA
NEVERTHELESS THE THOUGHTLESS YOUNG CREATURE WENT UP STRAIGHT TO HIM AND SAID ARE YOU THE RHINOCEROS SIR GO IN MADAM GO IN WE WERE DYING WITH LAUGHING
AND ALL THE LONG DISCUSSIONS WHICH THE FALSE CHEVALIER HAD WITH THE OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS A COMEDY WHICH THE KING ALLOWED TO GO ON ONLY BECAUSE IT AMUSED HIM
I TOOK MY REVENGE AMPLY BY TURNING SOME OF THEIR IDIOMS INTO RIDICULE SIR I ONCE SAID TO A GENTLEMAN HOW IS YOUR WIFE YOU DO HER GREAT HONOUR SIR
BUT GENERALLY MY QUID PRO QUOS ONLY RESULTED IN CURIOUS JOKES WHICH MADE MY FORTUNE
SHE WAS ON HER WAY BACK TO VENICE MUCH PLEASED WITH HER JOURNEY SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER A YOUNG GIRL OF TWELVE YEARS WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HER YOUTH CARRIED ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE ALL THE SIGNS OF PERFECTION
AND ADDING I WAS NOT AWARE OF YOUR MARRIAGE YET IT TOOK PLACE MORE THAN TWO YEARS SINCE SAID JULIETTE I KNOW IT FOR A FACT I SAID IN MY TURN
I WAS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN I WAS TAKING CARE OF TWO LADIES IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND THE WITTY MARQUISE WAS WALKING IN FRONT OF US
HE IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK WITH GREAT DILIGENCE
SECRETARY OF THE VENETIAN EMBASSY AN AMIABLE AND LEARNED MAN HE WAS SO DEEPLY IN LOVE THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO MARRY HER BUT THROUGH A CAPRICE WHICH SHE PERHAPS REGRETTED AFTERWARDS SHE ILL TREATED HIM AND THE FOOL DIED OF GRIEF
DURING THE LAST MONTH HE ADDED THE PLACE DE GREVE HAS SEEN THE HANGING OF SEVEN MEN
SHE DIED TEN YEARS AGO I WAS STILL TAKING MY FRENCH LESSONS WITH MY GOOD OLD CREBILLON YET MY STYLE WHICH WAS FULL OF ITALIANISMS
IN THE FIRST PART OF MY MEMOIRS I HAVE SPOKEN OF JULIETTE'S BEAUTY
THERE WAS A MAN PLACED TO RECEIVE THE MONEY OF THE VISITORS IT IS TRUE THAT THE MAN DRESSED IN THE AFRICAN FASHION WAS VERY DARK AND ENORMOUSLY STOUT YET HE HAD A HUMAN AND VERY MASCULINE FORM AND THE BEAUTIFUL MARQUISE HAD NO BUSINESS TO MAKE A MISTAKE
IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE RUSSIAN PRINCES TO WHOM THE TITLE OF PRINCE WAS REFUSED WHEN THEY WANTED TO BE PRESENTED THEY WERE CALLED KNEES BUT THEY DID NOT MIND IT BECAUSE THAT WORD MEANT PRINCE THE COURT OF FRANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOOLISHLY PARTICULAR ON THE QUESTION OF TITLES
AND FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN HER AFFECTIONS HE KILLED HIMSELF
PARIS DID NOT PROVE AN EL DORADO FOR MY HANDSOME COUNTRYWOMAN FOR SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PLEDGE HER DIAMONDS AND TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND HER AFTER HER RETURN TO VENICE SHE MARRIED THE SON OF THE UCCELLI WHO SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE HAD TAKEN HER OUT OF HER POVERTY
BUT SHE VERY LIKELY DID NOT TAKE HIS FANCY FOR CONTINUING TO WALK ON HE ADDRESSED TO THE MARSHAL THESE REMARKABLE WORDS WHICH JULIETTE MUST HAVE OVERHEARD WE HAVE HANDSOMER WOMEN HERE IN THE AFTERNOON I CALLED UPON THE VENETIAN AMBASSADOR
FOR QUERINI HAS HIMSELF WRITTEN TO ME ON THE SUBJECT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS AS I WAS PREPARING TO TAKE MY LEAVE THE AMBASSADOR UNDER PRETENSE OF SOME LETTERS THE CONTENTS OF WHICH HE WISHED TO COMMUNICATE TO ME
THEN I CAN GUESS REMARKED THE AMBASSADOR WHY JULIETTE DOES NOT WISH TO BE PRESENTED TO THE KING
FOOLISHLY TRANSLATING AN ITALIAN IDIOM I ASKED HER
I WAS ONE DAY PAYING MY FIRST VISIT TO THE WIFE OF PRESIDENT DE N WHEN HER NEPHEW A BRILLIANT BUTTERFLY CAME IN AND SHE INTRODUCED ME TO HIM MENTIONING MY NAME AND MY COUNTRY INDEED SIR YOU ARE ITALIAN SAID THE YOUNG MAN
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT IT WILL YOU HAVE SOME BREAKFAST NO I THANK YOU I HAVE TAKEN A CAFE AND TWO SAVOYARDS DEAR ME WHAT A FEROCIOUS BREAKFAST PRAY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
FOR TWO YEARS AGO THE LADY WAS INTRODUCED AS MADAME QUERINI AND WITH THE TITLE OF EXCELLENCY BY GENERAL SPADA TO ALL THE NOBILITY IN CESENA WHERE I WAS AT THAT TIME I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT ANSWERED THE AMBASSADOR FIXING HIS EYES UPON ME
HOW DID YOU SWALLOW THEM SOAKED IN MY COFFEE FOR THEY WERE NOT LARGER THAN THESE ON YOUR TABLE AND YOU CALL THESE SAVOYARDS SAY BISCUITS IN ITALY WE CALL THEM SAVOYARDS BECAUSE THEY WERE FIRST INVENTED IN SAVOY
ATTACKED ME UPON SOME REMARK I MADE RESPECTING AN ITALIAN PLAY AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SHEWING HIS BAD TEMPER BY CRITICIZING MY NATIVE COUNTRY I WAS ANSWERING HIM IN AN INDIRECT WAY LOOKING ALL THE TIME AT CAMILLE WHO WAS LAUGHING
EVERYBODY HAD CONGREGATED AROUND US AND WAS ATTENTIVE TO THE DISCUSSION WHICH BEING CARRIED ON AS AN ASSAULT OF WIT HAD NOTHING TO MAKE IT UNPLEASANT BUT IT SEEMED TO TAKE A SERIOUS TURN WHEN THE YOUNG FOP TURNING THE CONVERSATION ON THE POLICE OF THE CITY
WHO WAS CALLED LOLOTTE SHE WAS THE MISTRESS OF LORD ALBEMARLE THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR A WITTY AND VERY GENEROUS NOBLEMAN ONE EVENING HE COMPLAINED OF HIS MISTRESS PRAISING THE BEAUTY OF THE STARS WHICH WERE SHINING BRIGHTLY OVER HER HEAD
HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO WORK WITH SUCCESS FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS BUT HIS MAIN IDEA BEING TO COMPOSE A PICTURE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY
MADAME PREODOT WHO WAS ONE OF MY PUPILS RECEIVED ME ONE MORNING
SHE DID PERHAPS SHE HAS ALTERED HER MIND
YOU ARE STUPID MY GOOD FRIEND A CAFE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT IN WHICH COFFEE IS SOLD AND YOU OUGHT TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE DRUNK USE TASSE DE CAFE GOOD INDEED DO YOU DRINK THE CUP IN ITALY WE SAY A CAFFS AND WE ARE NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE THAT IT MEANS THE COFFEE HOUSE
I SHALL HAVE TO MENTION HER AGAIN IN MY MEMOIRS
NO ONE CAN ACCUSE HER OF ANY FAULT EXCEPT THAT OF BEING POOR BUT SHE FEELS IT ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ALLOW HER TO BE AS CHARITABLE AS SHE MIGHT WISH
WHEN I SEE WHAT THE SAME NATION IS DOING AGAINST THE KING THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE FREE IT IS A NOBLE AMBITION FOR MANKIND ARE NOT MADE TO BE THE SLAVES OF ONE MAN BUT WITH A NATION POPULOUS GREAT WITTY AND GIDDY WHAT WILL BE THE END OF THAT REVOLUTION
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE GENERALLY VERY PROUD OF THEIR TITLES THE KING LIKEWISE AFFECTED TO KNOW A NOBLEMAN ONLY WHEN HIS NAME WAS INSCRIBED AMONGST THOSE WHO SERVED HIM
HER WAIST MEASUREMENT IS NO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES IN THE HOPE OF REDUCING IT THE EARTH TAKES UNCEASING AND VIOLENT EXERCISE
WHICH HE HAD GIVEN IN HIS WILL TO CHARITABLE OBJECTS THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS COPIED INTO NEARLY ALL THE PAPERS ON THE CONTINENT AND IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY HAD SEEN OR HEARD OF THE ECCENTRIC PENCIL MAKER
HE WOULD TAKE A BLANK CARD AND WITH ONE OF HIS PENCILS WOULD PRETEND TO BE DRAWING THE PORTRAIT OF SOME MAN STANDING NEAR HIM THEN SHOWING HIS PICTURE TO THE CROWD IT PROVED TO BE THE HEAD OF A DONKEY
NOTWITHSTANDING A BYE LAW WHICH PREVENTS A PASSENGER FROM SMOKING WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF HIS FELLOWS IN THE COMPARTMENT WHICH IS NOT ALLOTTED TO SMOKERS
YOU ARE CAPTIVATED BY DIN AND GLITTER AND THEREIN LIES MY STRENGTH YEARS AGO I HIRED A MODEST SHOP IN THE RUE RIVOLI BUT I COULD NOT SELL PENCILS ENOUGH TO PAY MY RENT WHEREAS BY ASSUMING THIS DISGUISE
GENTLEMEN I WILL CONDESCEND TO ANSWER YOUR QUERIES
ALL WE ASK GENTLE READER IS THAT WHEN WE STRAY TOO FAR YOU WILL FAVOUR US WITH A GENTLE REMINDER CHAPTER TWO
WITHOUT PREVIOUS WARNING GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCES NOW AND THEN OF THIRD CLASS TRAVELLING
THE GLACIERS FILE AWAY THE MOUNTAINS INTO VALLEYS AND PLAINS BENEATH THE OCEAN BUSY INSECTS ARE BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS OF NEW CONTINENTS
KNAVES FOR DESIRING THE PUBLIC'S MONEY WITHOUT GIVING THEM AN EQUIVALENT I AM AN HONEST MAN
HE ALWAYS SOLD A GOOD ARTICLE AND NO PERSON WHO PURCHASED FROM HIM HAD CAUSE TO COMPLAIN I CONFESS I FELT SOMEWHAT CHAGRINED THAT THE MONSIEUR HAD THUS SUDDENLY TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE
A FREE FIGHT WAS AT ONE TIME AVOIDED ONLY BY THE INTERVENTION OF SOME OF THE OLDER PASSENGERS WHO DID NOT WANT TO ADD TO THE DISCOMFORT BY AN EXHIBITION OF TEMPER ON THE WAY PASSENGERS GOT FOR TEA
COMPARE THE LOT OF THE FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS WITH THAT OF THE THIRD CLASS IN THE MADRAS CASE THE FIRST CLASS FARE IS OVER FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE THIRD CLASS FARE
IT RESTED APPARENTLY UPON SOME PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHEN HE GAVE A START THEN WITH A DARK ANGRY EXPRESSION AS IF THE SIGHT WAS REPULSIVE HE ABRUPTLY DROPPED THE VISOR OF HIS HELMET
PURULIA ASANSOL AND OTHER JUNCTION STATIONS AND BEEN AT THE MOSAFIRKHANAS ATTACHED TO THESE STATIONS THEY ARE DISCREDITABLE LOOKING PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO ORDER NO CLEANLINESS
BUT IT IS ONE GRAND SECRET
THESE THREE MEN WERE BOUND FOR LUDHIANA AND HAD STILL MORE NIGHTS OF TRAVEL IN STORE FOR THEM WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL BUT NORMAL
IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF HIS GEOGRAPHY MOSES TELLS US THERE WERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY WE ARE PREPARING TO PUT UP THE STANDING ROOM ONLY NOTICE
AND A HELMET THE SERVANT THEN STRUCK UP A TUNE ON THE RICHLY TONED ORGAN WHICH ALWAYS FORMED A PART
AHA MONSIEUR BARNUM HE EXCLAIMED DID I NOT TELL YOU I HAD A NEW HUMBUG THAT WOULD DOUBLE THE SALES OF MY PENCILS I ASSURE YOU MY SALES ARE MORE THAN QUADRUPLED
I ASKED SOME OF THE PASSENGERS WHO WENT IN FOR THESE DAINTIES TO GIVE THEIR OPINION MANY OF THEM USED CHOICE EXPRESSIONS AS TO THE QUALITY BUT WERE SATISFIED TO STATE THAT THEY WERE HELPLESS IN THE MATTER
THEN HE WOULD DROP DOWN IN HIS CARRIAGE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND WIPE THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WHILE HIS SERVANT PLAYED ANOTHER OVERTURE ON THE ORGAN THIS GAVE HIS PURCHASERS A CHANCE TO WITHDRAW
I KNOW PASSENGERS WHO FAST WHILE THEY ARE TRAVELLING JUST IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE MISERY OF THEIR LIFE IN THE TRAINS
I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU I HAVE READ YOUR BOOK WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED HERE IN NUMEROUS EDITIONS I SEE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA OF THINGS YOUR MOTTO IS A GOOD ONE
ENVIOUS SWINDLERS MEN WHO TRY TO APE ME BUT ARE TOO STUPID AND TOO DISHONEST TO SUCCEED THEY ENDEAVOR TO ATTRACT NOTICE AS MOUNTEBANKS
WITHOUT IMPARTING TO ME THE GRAND SECRET BY WHICH HE WAS TO DOUBLE THE SALES OF HIS PENCILS BUT I HAD NOT LONG TO MOURN ON THAT ACCOUNT
I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ATTRACTING GENERAL ATTENTION AND IN SELLING LITERALLY MILLIONS OF MY PENCILS AND I ASSURE YOU THERE IS AT THIS MOMENT SCARCELY AN ARTIST IN FRANCE OR IN GREAT BRITAIN
BY BRILLIANT SKY ROCKETS AND BENGOLA LIGHTS THEN GIVE THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR MONEY YOU ARE VERY HAPPY I REPLIED IN YOUR MANNER OF ATTRACTING THE PUBLIC YOUR COSTUME IS ELEGANT
THERE WERE THREE STALWART PUNJABI MAHOMEDANS TWO REFINED TAMILIANS AND TWO MAHOMEDAN MERCHANTS WHO JOINED US LATER THE MERCHANTS RELATED THE BRIBES THEY HAD TO GIVE TO PROCURE COMFORT
HE RAISED HIS HAND AND HIS SERVANT UNDERSTANDING THE SIGN STOPPED THE ORGAN
THERE WERE TWO NIGHTS TO BE PASSED IN THIS TRAIN BEFORE REACHING MADRAS IF NOT MORE THAN TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS FOUND THEIR WAY INTO MY CARRIAGE BEFORE WE REACHED POONA IT WAS BECAUSE THE BOLDER ONES KEPT THE OTHERS AT BAY
AND THEN FOIST UPON THE PUBLIC WORTHLESS TRASH AND HOPE THUS TO SUCCEED AH DEFAMERS OF MINE YOU ARE FOOLS AS WELL AS KNAVES FOOLS TO THINK THAT ANY MAN CAN SUCCEED BY SYSTEMATICALLY AND PERSISTENTLY CHEATING THE PUBLIC
BUT YET TO NO PURPOSE AT THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL A CERTAIN THIRD CLASS BOOKING OFFICE IS A BLACK HOLE FIT ONLY TO BE DESTROYED
BOTH ARE INTENDED AS ADVERTISEMENTS OF SOMETHING GENUINE AND BOTH ANSWER THE PURPOSE AFTER COMPARING NOTES IN THIS WAY FOR AN HOUR WE PARTED AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MISTER B
TANNIN WATER WITH FILTHY SUGAR AND A WHITISH LOOKING LIQUID MIS CALLED MILK WHICH GAVE THIS WATER A MUDDY APPEARANCE I CAN VOUCH FOR THE APPEARANCE BUT I CITE THE TESTIMONY OF THE PASSENGERS
LET THE PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES THE VICEROY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THE RAJAS MAHARAJAS THE IMPERIAL COUNCILLORS AND OTHERS WHO GENERALLY TRAVEL IN SUPERIOR CLASSES
AND THE UNCOMPLAINING MILLIONS WILL GET SOME RETURN FOR THE FARES THEY PAY UNDER THE EXPECTATION OF BEING CARRIED FROM PLACE TO PLACE
AND ALSO PLACED IN FRONT OF HIM A VASE FILLED WITH MEDALS BEARING HIS LIKENESS ON ONE SIDE AND A DESCRIPTION OF HIS PENCILS ON THE OTHER HE THEN LEISURELY COMMENCED A CHANGE OF COSTUME
FEW PERSONS WHO HAVE VISITED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WITHIN THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS CAN HAVE FAILED TO HAVE SEEN HIM AND ONCE SEEN HE WAS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN WHILE PASSING THROUGH THE PUBLIC STREETS THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE TO DISTINGUISH HIM
TO DISTORT THE LANGUAGE AND THEY MUST NOT BE TAKEN TOO LITERALLY THE GIDDY GLOBE IS REALLY QUITE LARGE NOT TO SAY OBESE
CLAIRE BEECHER KUMMER IT TAKES MUCH LONGER TO WRITE A GEOGRAPHY THAN ACCORDING TO MOSES
AND HERALDED BY THE SAME SERVANT AND ORGAN THAT HAD ALWAYS ATTENDED HIM
THE PRESSURE BECAME UNBEARABLE THE RUSH OF PASSENGERS COULD NOT BE STAYED THE FIGHTERS AMONG US FOUND THE TASK ALMOST BEYOND THEM THE GUARDS OR OTHER RAILWAY SERVANTS CAME IN ONLY TO PUSH IN MORE PASSENGERS
TO THOSE DISPOSED TO HAVE A SOUVENIR OF THE GREAT HUMBUG HE WOULD SELL SIX PENCILS A MEDAL AND A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF FOR A FRANC TWENTY CENTS
WHAT ARE WE BUT MICROSCOPIC WEEVILS IN THE MOULDY CRUST OF EARTH SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY IS THE WEEVIL THEREOF CHAPTER THREE THE GIDDY GLOBE
IT WAS LABELLED TO CARRY TWENTY TWO PASSENGERS THESE COULD ONLY HAVE SEATING ACCOMMODATION THERE WERE NO BUNKS IN THIS CARRIAGE WHEREON PASSENGERS COULD LIE WITH ANY DEGREE OF SAFETY OR COMFORT
ARRIVING AT HIS DESTINED STOPPING PLACE HIS CARRIAGE HALTED HIS SERVANT HANDED HIM A CASE FROM WHICH HE TOOK SEVERAL LARGE PORTRAITS OF HIMSELF WHICH HE HUNG PROMINENTLY UPON THE SIDES OF HIS CARRIAGE
AND AFFORDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR A FRESH AUDIENCE TO CONGREGATE THEN WOULD FOLLOW A REPETITION OF HIS PREVIOUS SALES AND IN THIS WAY HE WOULD CONTINUE FOR HOURS
CHAPTER ONE THE CREATION SIX BUSY DAYS IT TOOK IN ALL
THREATENED TO STRIKE HIM AND LOCKED THE DOOR OVER THE PASSENGERS WHOM HE HAD WITH DIFFICULTY SQUEEZED IN TO THIS COMPARTMENT THERE WAS A CLOSET FALSELY SO CALLED
THE SEVENTH SOMEONE SAID TWAS GOOD AND RESTED SHOULD YOU THINK HE COULD KNOWING WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE
THERE WERE DURING THIS NIGHT AS MANY AS THIRTY FIVE PASSENGERS IN THE CARRIAGE DURING THE GREATER PART OF IT SOME LAY ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDST OF DIRT AND SOME HAD TO KEEP STANDING
HAVE THEIR SENSE OF DECENCY AND CLEANLINESS BLUNTED DURING THEIR TRAVELLING EXPERIENCE AMONG THE MANY SUGGESTIONS THAT CAN BE MADE FOR DEALING WITH THE EVIL HERE DESCRIBED I WOULD RESPECTFULLY INCLUDE THIS
OR THE PLACE DE LA MADELEINE ON SUNDAYS HIS FAVORITE LOCALITY WAS THE PLACE DE LA BOURSE
IT WAS DESIGNED AS A EUROPEAN CLOSET BUT COULD HARDLY BE USED AS SUCH THERE WAS A PIPE IN IT BUT NO WATER AND I SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CHALLENGE THAT IT WAS PESTILENTIALLY DIRTY THE COMPARTMENT ITSELF WAS EVIL LOOKING
THE PATRONIZING AIR WITH WHICH HE MADE THIS SPEECH SLAPPING ME AT THE SAME TIME FAMILIARLY UPON THE BACK
HIS DEATH CAUSED MANY AN HONEST SIGH AND HIS ABSENCE SEEMED TO CAST A GLOOM OVER SEVERAL OF HIS FAVORITE HALTING PLACES THE PARISIANS REALLY LOVED HIM AND WERE PROUD OF HIS GENIUS
STEPPING FORWARD AGAIN TO THE FRONT OF HIS CARRIAGE WHERE ALL THE GAPING CROWD COULD CATCH EVERY WORD HE EXCLAIMED GENTLEMEN YOU LOOK ASTONISHED YOU SEEM TO WONDER AND ASK YOURSELVES
ON INDIAN TRAINS ALONE PASSENGERS SMOKE WITH IMPUNITY IN ALL CARRIAGES IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE FAIR SEX AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PROTEST OF NON SMOKERS AND THIS
AND WITH THE DELIVERY OF EACH PENCIL HE WOULD RATTLE OFF A STRING OF WITTICISMS WHICH KEPT HIS PATRONS IN CAPITAL GOOD HUMOR AND FREQUENTLY HE WOULD SELL FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED PENCILS IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION
YOU WOULD NOT PATRONIZE TRUE UNPRETENDING HONEST MERIT BUT YOU ARE ATTRACTED BY MY GLITTERING CASQUE MY SWEEPING CREST MY WAVING PLUMES
HIS ROUND HAT WAS DISPLACED BY A MAGNIFICENT BURNISHED HELMET MOUNTED WITH RICH PLUMES OF VARIOUS BRILLIANT COLORS HIS OVERCOAT WAS LAID ASIDE AND HE DONNED IN ITS STEAD
I WOULD PAY HIM THE AUTHORISED FARE I HAD TO TURN PASSIVE RESISTER BEFORE I COULD BE TAKEN I SIMPLY TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE TO PULL ME OUT OF THE GHARI OR CALL THE POLICEMAN
WE MAY BE SURE THAT HE WOULD HAVE FOUND MANY THINGS NOT TO HIS LIKING TECHNICAL DEFECTS SUCH AS THE TREATMENT OF GRASS AND FOLIAGE IN GREEN INSTEAD OF THE PROPER PURPLE
A DEFIANT MEMON MERCHANT PROTESTED AGAINST THIS PACKING OF PASSENGERS LIKE SARDINES IN VAIN DID HE SAY THAT THIS WAS HIS FIFTH NIGHT ON THE TRAIN THE GUARD INSULTED HIM AND REFERRED HIM TO THE MANAGEMENT AT THE TERMINUS
LET US IMAGINE HOWEVER THAT CONCEALED IN THE CARGO OF HYPOTHETIC NEBULA DESTINED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WAS A PROTOPLASMIC STOWAWAY
I HAVE GOT A GRAND HUMBUG IN MY HEAD WHICH I SHALL PUT IN PRACTICE WITHIN A YEAR AND IT SHALL DOUBLE THE SALE OF MY PENCILS DON'T ASK ME WHAT IT IS BUT WITHIN ONE YEAR YOU SHALL SEE IT FOR YOURSELF AND YOU SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE
TO IMPRESS MISSUS BUTTERFLY STAMPED HIS TINY FOOT UPON THE DOME OF KING SOLOMON'S TEMPLE OUR CRITIC MIGHT HAVE DECLARED THE WORLD TOO FLIMSY IN CONSTRUCTION HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND FAULT WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE PLUMBING
WE HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE IT WOULD BE USELESS TO ATTEMPT CONCEALMENT WE HAVE THE DIGRESSION HABIT
THEY HAD TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY CAME ON REACHING THE STATION I FOUND THAT THE GHARI WALA WOULD NOT TAKE ME UNLESS I PAID THE FARE HE WANTED I MILDLY PROTESTED AND TOLD HIM
SHE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT AT RESERVE I WOULD ASK YOU TO COME INTO THE HOUSE SHE SAID BUT MY MEETINGS WITH YOU
SKEWERING ITS TISSUE IN A SCORE OF PLACES HE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE SKIRT AS THAT OF ONE OF HIS WIFE'S GOWNS THE GOWN THAT SHE HAD WORN WHEN SHE MET HIM ON THE VERY LAST OCCASION
HIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE TO UNDRESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HOWEVER HE HAD COMPLETED THE OPERATION A LONG CRY RESOUNDED WITHOUT PENETRATING BUT INDESCRIBABLE WHAT'S THAT
FITZPIERS STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL STRETCHING DOWN HIS HAND TO ASCERTAIN THE OBSTRUCTION
BOUGHS BEARING SUCH LEAVES HUNG LOW AROUND AND COMPLETELY ENCLOSED THEM SO THAT IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE IN A GREAT GREEN VASE WHICH HAD MOSS FOR ITS BOTTOM AND LEAF SIDES THE CLOUDS HAVING BEEN PACKED IN THE WEST THAT EVENING
THEY BY NO MEANS DISAPPEARED AND IN ALMOST EVERY VILLAGE ONE COULD BE FOUND IN SOME NOOK OR CORNER AS READILY AS THIS WAS FOUND BY TIM IT HAD INDEED BEEN A FEARFUL AMUSEMENT OF TIM AND OTHER HINTOCK LADS ESPECIALLY
THERE HAD BEEN THE TOOTHLESS VARIETY USED BY THE SOFTER HEARTED LANDLORDS QUITE CONTEMPTIBLE IN THEIR CLEMENCY THE JAWS OF THESE RESEMBLED THE JAWS OF AN OLD WOMAN TO WHOM TIME HAS LEFT NOTHING BUT GUMS THERE WERE ALSO THE INTERMEDIATE OR HALF TOOTHED SORTS
THOSE WHO HAD A DIM SENSE OF BECOMING RENOWNED POACHERS WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR PRIME TO DRAG OUT THIS TRAP FROM ITS HIDING SET IT AND THROW IT WITH BILLETS OF WOOD WHICH WERE PENETRATED BY THE TEETH TO THE DEPTH OF NEAR AN INCH
BUT WHY ARE YOU NOT THERE NOW SHE SAID BECAUSE I CANNOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM HERE TILL I HAVE YOUR PROMISE NOW DARLING YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME THERE WILL YOU NOT TO NIGHT HAS SETTLED THAT GRACE'S TREMBLINGS
AND WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL INDEED HE CONTINUED TO PRESS HIS FACE TO HERS YOU ARE MINE MINE AGAIN NOW SHE GENTLY OWNED THAT SHE SUPPOSED SHE WAS I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS INJURED SHE WENT ON SHYLY
OPEN READY
HE WOULD REACH THE TRAP A GOOD HALF MINUTE BEFORE SHE COULD REACH THE SAME SPOT BUT HERE A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE CAME IN TO ESCAPE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING WATCHED OR LISTENED TO BY LURKERS NATURALLY CURIOUS BY REASON OF THEIR STRAINED RELATIONS THEY HAD ARRANGED
THE USE OF SUCH IMPLEMENTS WAS WELL NIGH DISCONTINUED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
GREW APART UPWARD FORMING A V SHAPED OPENING BETWEEN AND BEING BACKED UP BY BUSHES LEFT THIS AS THE ONLY COURSE FOR A FOOT PASSENGER IN IT HE LAID THE TRAP WITH THE SAME GENTLENESS OF HANDLING
HE STOOD STILL TO AWAIT HER HE HAD NOT PAUSED UNDER THE PRICKLY FOLIAGE MORE THAN TWO MINUTES WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A SCREAM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE FITZPIERS WONDERED WHAT IT COULD MEAN BUT SUCH WIND AS THERE WAS JUST NOW BLEW IN AN ADVERSE DIRECTION
HAVING COMPLETED THESE ARRANGEMENTS TIM SPRANG THROUGH THE ADJOINING HEDGE OF HIS FATHER'S GARDEN RAN DOWN THE PATH AND SOFTLY ENTERED THE HOUSE OBEDIENT TO HIS ORDER SUKE HAD GONE TO BED AND AS SOON AS HE HAD BOLTED THE DOOR
BUT THAT NEWLY DONE UP PLACE THE EARL OF WESSEX
I HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE OR RATHER A PARTNERSHIP
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO I DID NOT WANT TO ALARM MY FATHER OR ANYBODY AS I WISHED NOBODY TO KNOW OF THESE MEETINGS WITH YOU SO I COULD THINK OF NO OTHER PLAN THAN SLIPPING OFF MY SKIRT
TIM STEALTHILY OPENED THE WINDOW AND LISTENED ABOVE THE LOW HARMONIES PRODUCED BY THE INSTRUMENTATION OF THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF TREES AROUND THE PREMISES HE COULD HEAR THE TWITCHING OF A CHAIN FROM THE SPOT WHEREON HE HAD SET THE MAN TRAP
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO PREPARE HIM NEVER MIND DEAREST I COULD NOT VERY WELL HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION I SHALL NEVER LIVE HERE AGAIN AS MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MINE I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU ON THIS VERY POINT BUT MY ALARM HAD PUT IT OUT OF MY HEAD
AND WHEN HER CUSTOMARY CONTOURS WERE THUS RESTORED THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER GRACE TAKING HIS ARM
HAD GONE OFF AND SHE DID NOT SAY NAY THEY WENT ON TOGETHER
BUT FURTHER HUMAN SOUND THERE WAS NONE TIM WAS PUZZLED
FEELING THEN A LITTLE UNEASY HIS MIND REVERTED TO THE SCREAM AND HE WENT FORWARD OVER THE SUMMIT AND DOWN THE EMBOWERED INCLINE
THAT THEIR MEETING FOR TO NIGHT SHOULD BE AT THE HOLM TREE ON THE RIDGE ABOVE NAMED SO SOON ACCORDINGLY
NOT SO VERY LONG AGO SHE BECAME LOST IN LONG PONDERINGS
RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE NARROW PASS BETWEEN THE OAKS WERE DENSE BUSHES AND NOW FROM BEHIND THESE A FEMALE FIGURE GLIDED WHOSE APPEARANCE EVEN IN THE GLOOM WAS THOUGH GRACEFUL IN OUTLINE NOTICEABLY STRANGE
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT I DISCOVERED IT WAS IRON AND THAT MY CLOTHES WERE CAUGHT IN A TRAP I PULLED THIS WAY AND THAT BUT THE THING WOULD NOT LET GO
OF ALL THE DEGREES AND QUALITIES OF PUNISHMENT THAT FITZPIERS HAD UNDERGONE SINCE HIS SINS AGAINST GRACE FIRST BEGAN NOT ANY EVEN APPROXIMATED IN INTENSITY TO THIS OH MY OWN MY DARLING OH CRUEL HEAVEN IT IS TOO MUCH THIS
AS THE TRUE AND ONLY PERIOD OF MERRY ENGLAND IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS MORE ESPECIALLY AND ONWARD DOWN TO THE THIRD DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS MODEL HAD BORNE THE PALM AND HAD BEEN MOST USUALLY FOLLOWED WHEN THE ORCHARDS AND ESTATES REQUIRED NEW ONES
SO AS TO RETAIN THE DEPARTING GLARE A LONG WHILE THE HOUR HAD SEEMED MUCH EARLIER THAN IT WAS BUT SUDDENLY THE QUESTION OF TIME OCCURRED TO HER
SHE WAS IN WHITE UP TO THE WAIST AND FIGURED ABOVE SHE WAS IN SHORT GRACE HIS WIFE LACKING THE PORTION OF HER DRESS WHICH THE GIN RETAINED DON'T BE GRIEVED ABOUT ME DON'T DEAR EDGAR SHE EXCLAIMED RUSHING UP AND BENDING OVER HIM I AM NOT HURT A BIT
READING IT SLOWLY THROUGH SHE BECAME QUITE APPALLED AT HER RECENT OFF HANDEDNESS WHEN SHE REDISCOVERED WHAT AWFULLY SOLEMN PROMISES SHE HAD MADE HIM AT THOSE
AND I KNOW THAT A MAN WHO COULD SUFFER AS YOU WERE SUFFERING MUST HAVE A TENDER REGARD FOR ME BUT HOW DOES THIS AWFUL THING COME HERE
MIGHT BE BOUND BY VOWS MADE WITHOUT AT THE TIME A FULL RECOGNITION OF THEIR FORCE THAT PARTICULAR SENTENCE BEGINNING WHOM GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER WAS A STAGGERER FOR A GENTLEWOMAN OF STRONG DEVOTIONAL SENTIMENT
HERE BY THE HELP OF A STOUT STAKE HE SET THE TRAP AND LAID IT CAREFULLY BEHIND A BUSH WHILE HE WENT FORWARD TO RECONNOITRE AS HAS BEEN STATED NOBODY PASSED THIS WAY FOR DAYS TOGETHER SOMETIMES BUT THERE WAS JUST A POSSIBILITY
THE POSITION OF THINGS AT THAT CRITICAL JUNCTURE WAS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS
AND BETWEEN ITS JAWS WAS PART OF A WOMAN'S CLOTHING A PATTERNED SILK SKIRT
I WAS COMING ON TO FIND YOU AFTER I HAD RELEASED MYSELF BUT I HEARD FOOTSTEPS AND I HID AWAY
TIM TANGS TURNED ABOUT AND RAN DOWN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HILL TILL HE WAS AGAIN AT THE HEAD OF HIS OWN GARDEN IT WAS THE WORK OF A FEW MOMENTS TO DRAG OUT THE MAN TRAP VERY GENTLY THAT THE PLATE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED SUFFICIENTLY TO THROW IT TO A SPACE BETWEEN A PAIR OF YOUNG OAKS
WERE THE INVENTORS OF AUTOMATIC MACHINES TO BE RANGED ACCORDING TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THEIR DEVICES FOR PRODUCING SOUND ARTISTIC TORTURE
IT'S WINDY DIET FOR A COLT I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS DICK MUCH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL A YOUNG WOLF A LION AND EXPECT HIM TO TAKE THE COMPLIMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHIN BONE DICK'S SOUL IS IN THE BANK
YOU'RE OUT OF STEP THEN YOU NOTICED IT TOO OF COURSE I DID YOU'RE ALWAYS OUT OF STEP SO I AM I'M SORRY YOU WENT ON WITH THE PAINTING
HE BEGAN BY THINKING OF TORPENHOW'S ADVICE BUT AS OF CUSTOM LOST HIMSELF IN THE STUDY OF THE FACES FLOCKING PAST SOME HAD DEATH WRITTEN ON THEIR FEATURES AND DICK MARVELLED THAT THEY COULD LAUGH
TORPENHOW LAUGHED AS HE ENTERED
HE'S INTENSELY SUSPICIOUS AND UTTERLY LAWLESS MATTER OF TEMPER SAID THE NILGHAI IT'S THE SAME WITH HORSES SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY WORK
SO I TOLD HIM I DON'T THINK HE BELIEVES IT THEY NEVER DO WHEN THEY FIRST START OFF WHAT'S THAT WRECK ON THE GROUND THERE SPECIMEN OF HIS LATEST IMPERTINENCE
HE'S WORKING FOR CASH NOW HE HAS THROWN UP WAR WORK I SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T SEE THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SERVICE ARE JUST THE SAME ONLY THE PROPRIETORS ARE CHANGED HOW SHOULD HE KNOW
WELL I LURED MY MODEL A BEAUTIFUL RIFLEMAN UP HERE WITH DRINK I DRORED HIM AND I REDRORED HIM AND I REDRORED HIM AND I MADE HIM A FLUSHED DISHEVELLED BEDEVILLED SCALLAWAG
THAT SOUNDS VERY FINE BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE THEY ARE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DO WORK FOR WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THEY ARE YOUR MASTERS DON'T BE DECEIVED DICKIE YOU AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO TRIFLE WITH THEM
OF COURSE I SAID I SHOULD I WAS AT THE SLADE THEN AT MERTON'S IN SAINT JOHN'S WOOD THE BIG STUDIO THEN I PEPPER POTTED I MEAN I WENT TO THE NATIONAL AND NOW I'M WORKING UNDER KAMI
WHEN WERE YOU UNDER KAMI MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY BEGINNINGS I STUDIED WITH HIM FOR TWO YEARS IN PARIS HE TAUGHT BY PERSONAL MAGNETISM
OHO THAT'S IT IS IT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN SLATE ME YOU'RE WRONG YOU CAN ONLY DESCRIBE
THEY ROSE FROM A WRECK OF ODDMENTS THAT BEGAN WITH FELT COVERED WATER BOTTLES BELTS AND REGIMENTAL BADGES AND ENDED WITH A SMALL BALE OF SECOND HAND UNIFORMS AND A STAND OF MIXED ARMS
GO HOME NILGHAI SAID DICK GO HOME TO YOUR LONELY LITTLE BED AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO DO IT AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY HE HAS CAUGHT THE NOTE THAT CATCHES A PUBLIC WHO THINK WITH THEIR BOOTS AND READ WITH THEIR ELBOWS THE COLD BLOODED INSOLENCE OF THE WORK ALMOST SAVES IT
ON EASILY ACQUIRED MONEY FOR THAT MONEY AND YOUR OWN INFERNAL VANITY YOU ARE WILLING TO DELIBERATELY TURN OUT BAD WORK YOU'LL DO QUITE ENOUGH BAD WORK WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND DICKIE AS I LOVE YOU AND AS I KNOW YOU LOVE ME
AN AFFABLE ACTRESS A DEVASTATING CYCLONE OR MINE OWN SWEET SELF AND YOU PRESUME TO LECTURE ME ABOUT MY WORK NILGHAI IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE I'D CARICATURE YOU IN FOUR PAPERS
BUT HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ART CONFOUND HIM HE GAVE ME A LECTURE ON IT AND RECOMMENDED ME TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN TECHNIQUE I WONDER WHAT OLD KAMI WOULD HAVE SAID TO THAT

THAT'S HIS LAST SHOT SECOND EDITION GO ON PUBLIC
MODEST MAN GO ON
IT'S A CLUMSY ENDING AND VILE JOURNALESE BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE AND YET HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SNATCHED AT THE MANUSCRIPT
I'D LET YOU GO TO THE DEUCE ON YOUR OWN MAHL STICK BUT WHEN I CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE TO ME AND WHEN I FIND THAT TO VANITY
NEVER MIND THAT I AM COMMISSIONED TO SMITE YOU IN PRINT TORPENHOW REFUSES FROM FALSE DELICACY I'VE BEEN OVERHAULING THE POT BOILERS IN YOUR STUDIO THEY ARE SIMPLY DISGRACEFUL
AND I SHAN'T WANT ANY DINNER THE DOOR SHUT AND WAS LOCKED WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A MAN LIKE THAT SAID THE NILGHAI LEAVE HIM ALONE HE'S AS MAD AS A HATTER
WITH HIS HELMET AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE LIVING FEAR OF DEATH IN HIS EYE AND THE BLOOD OOZING OUT OF A CUT OVER HIS ANKLE BONE HE WASN'T PRETTY BUT HE WAS ALL SOLDIER AND VERY MUCH MAN
AND IT WAS LONELY THESE LONG EVENINGS A MAN CAN'T WORK FOR EVER A MAN MIGHT HAVE GONE TO A PUB AND GOT DECENTLY DRUNK I WISH I HAD BUT I FORGATHERED WITH SOME MEN OF SORTS
I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE FOR ALL THE GOLD IN ENGLAND THAT'S SETTLED NOW SWEAR DON'T KNOW SAID DICK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF ANGRY BUT I CAN'T
AND THAT ALL SHOULD BE AS IT WAS OF OLD SHE WORE A CLOSELY FITTING GRAY DRESS SINCE THE HUMAN SOUL IS FINITE AND NOT IN THE LEAST UNDER ITS OWN COMMAND DICK ADVANCING SAID
AS IF THEIR SOULS MATTERED I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT ART AND SEEN LESS OF HER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAN IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE DO YOU REMEMBER CASSAVETTI WHO WORKED FOR SOME CONTINENTAL SYNDICATE OUT WITH THE DESERT COLUMN
EVERY PULSE OF DICK'S BODY THROBBED FURIOUSLY AND HIS PALATE DRIED IN HIS MOUTH THE FOG SHUT DOWN AGAIN AND MAISIE'S FACE WAS PEARL WHITE THROUGH IT NO WORD WAS SPOKEN
AT ELEVEN THERE WAS A KICKING ON THE STUDIO DOOR IS THE NILGHAI WITH YOU STILL SAID A VOICE FROM WITHIN THEN TELL HIM HE MIGHT HAVE CONDENSED THE WHOLE OF HIS LUMBERING NONSENSE INTO AN EPIGRAM
PIG CHINESE PIG I'VE WORKED FOR THIS I'VE SWEATED AND I'VE STARVED FOR THIS LINE ON LINE AND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND NOW I'VE GOT IT I AM GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT WHILE IT LASTS LET THEM PAY THEY'VE NO KNOWLEDGE
OR WITH YOURSELF WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT MOREOVER COME BACK BINKIE THAT RED DAUB ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE UNLESS YOU TAKE PRECIOUS GOOD CARE YOU WILL FALL UNDER THE DAMNATION OF THE CHECK BOOK AND THAT'S WORSE THAN DEATH
I MUST SEE YOU AGAIN AND PERHAPS I COULD HELP YOU I I PAINT A LITTLE MYSELF I MAY BE IN THE PARK TO MORROW IF THERE IS NO WORKING LIGHT
THAT IS ART I POLISHED HIS BOOTS OBSERVE THE HIGH LIGHT ON THE TOE THAT IS ART I CLEANED HIS RIFLE RIFLES ARE ALWAYS CLEAN ON SERVICE BECAUSE THAT IS ART I PIPECLAYED HIS HELMET
HE DIED DICK NOT CARTRIDGES OVER EATING HE WAS ALWAYS GREEDY
DID HE CUT YOU OUT YOU'LL SEE WHEN I HAVE DEALT WITH HIM BUT AFTER ALL WHAT'S THE GOOD LEAVE HIM ALONE AND HE'LL COME HOME IF HE HAS ANY STUFF IN HIM DRAGGING OR WAGGING HIS TAIL BEHIND HIM
OVER THERE HE POINTED EASTWARD THROUGH THE FOG AND YOU OH I'M IN THE NORTH THE BLACK NORTH ACROSS ALL THE PARK I AM VERY BUSY WHAT DO YOU DO
THEY HAVE NO ARENAS NOW BUT THEY MUST HAVE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS YOU'RE A FAT GLADIATOR WHO COMES UP THROUGH A TRAP DOOR AND TALKS OF WHAT HE'S SEEN YOU STAND ON PRECISELY THE SAME LEVEL AS AN ENERGETIC BISHOP
HERE'S THE PERORATION FOR WORK DONE WITHOUT CONVICTION FOR POWER WASTED ON TRIVIALITIES FOR LABOUR EXPENDED WITH LEVITY FOR THE DELIBERATE PURPOSE OF WINNING THE EASY APPLAUSE OF A FASHION DRIVEN PUBLIC
SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY JIB AND SOME YOU WALLOP AND THEY GO OUT FOR A WALK WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DICK HAS DONE SAID TORPENHOW WAIT TILL HE COMES BACK IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR SLATING HERE
AND A SHIFT OF THE SAME WIND THAT HAD OPENED THE FOG DROVE ACROSS DICK'S FACE THE BLACK SMOKE OF A RIVER STEAMER AT HER BERTH BELOW THE WALL HE WAS BLINDED FOR THE MOMENT THEN SPUN ROUND AND FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH
THEN JACK'S NO WORSE NEVER MIND WHICH WE PASS ON IN HOT PURSUIT THE WOUND ITSELF WHICH BRINGS HIM IS NOT FELT THE BEST WAY IS TO STAND UP TO HIM THE MAN WHO FLIES IS IN TEN TIMES MORE DANGER THAN THE MAN WHO MARCHES UP INTO HIS JAWS
ELSE NO TONGUE COULD HAVE DESCRIBED SUSANNAH'S AFFLICTION IS NOT ALL FLESH GRASS TIS CLAY
ALL THESE WERE PAINTED WHITE THREE TIMES OVER THE ENSUING SPRING WHICH ENABLED MY UNCLE TOBY TO TAKE THE FIELD WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR MY FATHER WOULD OFTEN SAY TO YORICK THAT IF ANY MORTAL IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE HAD DONE SUCH A THING EXCEPT HIS BROTHER TOBY
TRIM TOOK HIS HAT OFF THE GROUND PUT IT UPON HIS HEAD AND THEN WENT ON WITH HIS ORATION UPON DEATH IN MANNER AND FORM FOLLOWING
EXCEPT NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW DUE WEST FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS TOGETHER WHICH DETAINED THE FLANDERS MAIL AND KEPT THEM SO LONG IN TORTURE BUT STILL TWAS THE TORTURE OF THE HAPPY IN THIS TRACK I SAY
THE OTHER WITH BLACK EBONY TIPP'D WITH SILVER MY FATHER WHO SAW ALL THINGS IN LIGHTS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD SAY TO THE CORPORAL THAT HE OUGHT TO LOOK UPON THESE TWO PRESENTS MORE AS TOKENS OF HIS BROTHER'S NICETY THAN HIS AFFECTION TOM DID NOT CARE TRIM
OF THE INCESSANT FIRINGS KEPT UP BY THE BESIEGERS AND SO HEATED WAS MY UNCLE TOBY'S IMAGINATION WITH THE ACCOUNTS OF THEM THAT HE HAD INFALLIBLY SHOT AWAY ALL HIS ESTATE SOMETHING THEREFORE WAS WANTING AS A SUCCEDANEUM
THAT ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST YEAR'S CAMPAIGN THE WORD TOWN IS OFTEN MENTIONED YET THERE WAS NO TOWN AT THAT TIME WITHIN THE POLYGON THAT ADDITION WAS NOT MADE TILL THE SUMMER FOLLOWING THE SPRING IN WHICH THE BRIDGES AND SENTRY BOX WERE PAINTED WHICH WAS THE THIRD YEAR OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S CAMPAIGNS
IN WHICH A PRACTICABLE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE BY THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH
I SHALL BEHOLD HIM AS HE INSPECTS THE LACKERED PLATE
SHE WEPT BUT SHE COURT'SIED TOO ARE WE NOT CONTINUED TRIM LOOKING STILL AT SUSANNAH ARE WE NOT LIKE A FLOWER OF THE FIELD A TEAR OF PRIDE STOLE IN BETWIXT EVERY TWO TEARS OF HUMILIATION
I WOULD DO IT THERE SAID TRIM BUT THAT IS NATURE NATURE IS NATURE SAID JONATHAN AND THAT IS THE REASON CRIED SUSANNAH I SO MUCH PITY MY MISTRESS SHE WILL NEVER GET THE BETTER OF IT NOW I PITY THE CAPTAIN THE MOST OF ANY ONE IN THE FAMILY ANSWERED TRIM
SO TOOK IT OFF IN ESSAYING TO PUT ON HIS REGIMENTAL COAT AND WAISTCOAT MY UNCLE TOBY FOUND THE SAME OBJECTION IN HIS WIG SO THAT WENT OFF TOO
AND THAT I HAVE NOT LEFT A SINGLE INCH FOR IT FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INCROACHING UPON HIS KITCHEN GARDEN FOR THE SAKE OF ENLARGING HIS WORKS ON THE BOWLING GREEN AND FOR THAT REASON GENERALLY RAN HIS FIRST AND SECOND PARALLELS BETWIXT TWO ROWS OF HIS CABBAGES AND HIS CAULIFLOWERS
WITHOUT ONE YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT MADAM I'VE COST YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE I WISH IT MAY ANSWER
AND TWILL BREAK THY SET NO MATTER FOR THAT EUGENIUS
IT SHALL BE DONE IN TWO MINUTES AMONGST MANY OTHER BOOK DEBTS ALL OF WHICH I SHALL DISCHARGE IN DUE TIME I OWN MYSELF A DEBTOR TO THE WORLD FOR TWO ITEMS A CHAPTER UPON CHAMBER MAIDS AND BUTTON HOLES
AND THEN RETURNING PALE AS ASHES TO THE DOOR TO TAKE HIS MOURNING HORSE BY THE BRIDLE TO FOLLOW HIS HEARSE AS HE DIRECTED THEE WHERE
COMPRESSED INTO A CLOD OF THE VALLEY BUT WHAT
WHEN I SHALL ARRIVE AT THIS DREADED PAGE DEAL NOT WITH ME THEN WITH A STINTED HAND
DID MY UNCLE TOBY AND TRIM MOVE FOR MANY YEARS EVERY YEAR OF WHICH AND SOMETIMES EVERY MONTH
AND WHENEVER HE IS DISSECTED TWILL BE FOUND SO
O JONATHAN TWOULD MAKE A GOOD NATURED MAN'S HEART BLEED TO CONSIDER CONTINUED THE CORPORAL STANDING PERPENDICULARLY HOW LOW MANY A BRAVE AND UPRIGHT FELLOW HAS BEEN LAID SINCE THAT TIME AND TRUST ME SUSY ADDED THE CORPORAL TURNING TO SUSANNAH
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MODEL OF A TOWN BUILT FOR THEM TO BE RUN UP TOGETHER OF SLIT DEALS
IF A MAN WILL BUT TAKE ME BY THE HAND
BUT TO THOSE JONATHAN WHO KNOW WHAT DEATH IS AND WHAT HAVOCK AND DESTRUCTION HE CAN MAKE
MY UNCLE TOBY HAD SCARCE TURNED THE CORNER OF HIS YEW HEDGE
BETWIXT THE FINGER AND THUMB OF HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE EBONY PIPE TIPP'D WITH SILVER WHICH APPERTAINED TO THE BATTERY ON THE LEFT BETWIXT THE FINGER AND THUMB OF THE OTHER AND WITH HIS RIGHT KNEE FIXED FIRM UPON THE GROUND AS IF IN THE FRONT RANK OF HIS PLATOON WAS THE CORPORAL
AT THE LATTER END OF THE SAME YEAR HE ADDED A COUPLE OF GATES WITH PORT CULLISES THESE LAST WERE CONVERTED AFTERWARDS INTO ORGUES AS THE BETTER THING AND DURING THE WINTER OF THE SAME YEAR MY UNCLE TOBY INSTEAD OF A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH HE ALWAYS HAD AT CHRISTMAS
AND SO ON GAINING GROUND AND MAKING THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE WORKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL THE TOWN FELL INTO THEIR HANDS TO ONE WHO TOOK PLEASURE IN THE HAPPY STATE OF OTHERS THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GREATER SIGHT IN WORLD THAN ON A POST MORNING
HIS FIRST INTENTION AS I SAID WAS NO MORE THAN GIVING THE ENEMY A SINGLE PUFF OR TWO BUT THE PLEASURE OF THE PUFFS AS WELL AS THE PUFFING HAD INSENSIBLY GOT HOLD OF THE CORPORAL AND DRAWN HIM ON FROM PUFF TO PUFF INTO THE VERY HEIGHT OF THE ATTACK BY THE TIME MY UNCLE TOBY JOINED HIM
I'LL BE BOUND SAID THE CORPORAL SPEAKING TO HIMSELF TO GIVE AWAY MY MONTERO CAP TO THE FIRST BEGGAR WHO COMES TO THE DOOR IF I DO NOT MANAGE THIS MATTER TO HIS HONOUR'S SATISFACTION THE COMPLETION WAS NO FURTHER OFF THAN THE VERY NEXT MORNING
MY UNCLE TOBY THINKING A TOWN LOOKED FOOLISHLY WITHOUT A CHURCH ADDED A VERY FINE ONE WITH A STEEPLE TRIM WAS FOR HAVING BELLS IN IT MY UNCLE TOBY SAID THE METAL HAD BETTER BE CAST INTO CANNON THIS
THE CAMPAIGNS THEMSELVES WILL TAKE UP AS MANY BOOKS AND THEREFORE I APPREHEND IT WOULD BE HANGING TOO GREAT A WEIGHT OF ONE KIND OF MATTER IN SO FLIMSY A PERFORMANCE AS THIS TO RHAPSODIZE THEM AS I ONCE INTENDED INTO THE BODY OF THE WORK SURELY THEY HAD BETTER BE PRINTED APART
OH CORPORAL HAD I THEE BUT NOW NOW THAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE THEE A DINNER AND PROTECTION HOW WOULD I CHERISH THEE THOU SHOULD'ST WEAR THY MONTERO CAP EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK
IT MUST IN MY OPINION BE MOST NATURAL IN BED REPLIED SUSANNAH
WHOSE EYES WERE SWIMMING IN WATER BEFORE THAT TIME COMES ROUND AGAIN
AS ALWAYS FALLS OUT WHEN A MAN IS IN THE MOST HASTE
WHICH OF ALL THESE WAS THE CAUSE LET THE CURIOUS PHYSIOLOGIST OR THE CURIOUS ANY BODY DETERMINE
WHICH LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S KITCHEN GARDEN AND WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF SO MANY OF HIS DELICIOUS HOURS
THE MONTERO CAP I SHALL DESCRIBE BY AND BYE THE TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES HAD NOTHING PARTICULAR IN THEM THEY WERE FITTED UP AND ORNAMENTED AS USUAL WITH FLEXIBLE TUBES OF MOROCCO LEATHER AND GOLD WIRE
OUT OF LOVE HE IS A FRIEND AND A BROTHER TO ME
WHICH WAS HALF AN HOUR LATER THAN HIS USUAL TIME BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY SALLIED OUT
AND THE REST OF THE TOWNS IN BRABANT AND FLANDERS THE OTHER WAS NOT TO HAVE THE HOUSES RUN UP TOGETHER AS THE CORPORAL PROPOSED BUT TO HAVE EVERY HOUSE INDEPENDENT TO HOOK ON OR OFF SO AS TO FORM INTO THE PLAN OF WHATEVER TOWN THEY PLEASED
THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT PARTICULARLY THAT VERY YEAR HAD TAKEN THE FIELD BUT TIS NOT MY BROTHER TOBY'S NATURE KIND SOUL MY FATHER WOULD ADD TO INSULT ANY ONE BUT LET US GO ON
WHEN THE TOWN WITH ITS WORKS WAS FINISHED MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL BEGAN TO RUN THEIR FIRST PARALLEL NOT AT RANDOM OR ANY HOW BUT FROM THE SAME POINTS AND DISTANCES THE ALLIES HAD BEGUN TO RUN THEIRS
AND YET NEVER WAS A MONTERO CAP PUT TO SO MANY USES FOR IN ALL CONTROVERTED POINTS WHETHER MILITARY OR CULINARY PROVIDED THE CORPORAL WAS SURE HE WAS IN THE RIGHT IT WAS EITHER HIS OATH HIS WAGER OR HIS GIFT
HE WOULD SAY TO PUT ON THE CAP OR TO SMOKE IN THE TOBACCO PIPE OF A JEW GOD BLESS YOUR HONOUR THE CORPORAL WOULD SAY
WHICH HAD LAID INSIDE OUT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE CORNER OF AN OLD CAMPAIGNING TRUNK WHICH STOOD BY HIS BEDSIDE
AND DRUSEN AND HAGENAU AND THEN IT WAS OSTEND AND MENIN AND AETH AND DENDERMOND SURELY NEVER DID ANY TOWN ACT SO MANY PARTS SINCE SODOM AND GOMORRAH AS MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOWN DID IN THE FOURTH YEAR
WITH THE SUPPLEMENT OF THREE SMALLER TUBES OF WASH LEATHER AT EACH OF THEIR LOWER ENDS TO BE TAGG'D BY THE SAME NUMBER OF TIN PIPES FITTED TO THE TOUCH HOLES AND SEALED WITH CLAY NEXT THE CANNON
AND WHAT MUST I DO WITH THIS FOOT I SHALL NEVER REACH ENGLAND WITH IT FOR MY OWN PART I NEVER WONDER AT ANY THING
MY UNCLE TOBY AFTER HE HAD TURNED THE ROUGH SIDE OUTWARDS PUT IT ON THIS DONE HE PROCEEDED NEXT TO HIS BREECHES AND HAVING BUTTONED THE WAIST BAND HE FORTHWITH BUCKLED ON HIS SWORD BELT AND HAD GOT HIS SWORD HALF WAY IN WHEN HE CONSIDERED HE SHOULD WANT SHAVING
AND IN A SHORT TIME THESE LED THE WAY FOR A TRAIN OF SOMEWHAT LARGER
DECORATED WITH THE MILITARY ENSIGNS OF THY MASTER THE FIRST THE FOREMOST OF CREATED BEINGS WHERE I SHALL SEE THEE FAITHFUL SERVANT LAYING HIS SWORD AND SCABBARD WITH A TREMBLING HAND ACROSS HIS COFFIN
WHAT INTENSE PLEASURE SWIMMING IN HIS EYE AS HE STOOD OVER THE CORPORAL READING THE PARAGRAPH TEN TIMES OVER TO HIM AS HE WAS AT WORK LEST PERADVENTURE HE SHOULD MAKE THE BREACH AN INCH TOO WIDE OR LEAVE IT AN INCH TOO NARROW
SAID SUSANNAH HE IS A KINDLY HEARTED GENTLEMAN SAID OBADIAH AS EVER LIVED AYE AND AS BRAVE A ONE TOO SAID THE CORPORAL AS EVER STEPT BEFORE A PLATOON THERE NEVER WAS A BETTER OFFICER IN THE KING'S ARMY OR A BETTER MAN IN GOD'S WORLD FOR HE WOULD MARCH UP TO THE MOUTH OF A CANNON
TREATED HIMSELF WITH A HANDSOME SENTRY BOX TO STAND AT THE CORNER OF THE BOWLING GREEN BETWIXT WHICH POINT AND THE FOOT OF THE GLACIS THERE WAS LEFT A LITTLE KIND OF AN ESPLANADE FOR HIM AND THE CORPORAL TO CONFER AND HOLD COUNCILS OF WAR UPON THE SENTRY BOX WAS IN CASE OF RAIN
THEY ALL LOOKED DIRECTLY AT THE SCULLION THE SCULLION HAD JUST BEEN SCOURING A FISH KETTLE IT WAS NOT FAIR WHAT IS THE FINEST FACE THAT EVER MAN LOOKED AT I COULD HEAR TRIM TALK SO FOR EVER CRIED SUSANNAH WHAT IS IT
LET NO MAN WHO HAS READ MY FATHER'S FIRST AND SECOND BEDS OF JUSTICE EVER RISE UP AND SAY AGAIN FROM COLLISION OF WHAT KINDS OF BODIES LIGHT MAY OR MAY NOT BE STRUCK OUT TO CARRY THE ARTS AND SCIENCES UP TO PERFECTION HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST HOW I LOVE THEM
BEING APPOINTED ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD HE HAD PREVENTED HIM IN OFFERING UP THOSE PRAYERS AND THOSE SACRIFICES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE FOR THE MULTITUDE AND THAT HE THEREFORE
THAT HE HAD BEEN SO QUICK IN OFFERING HIS SACRIFICES UPON ACCOUNT OF THE NECESSITY HE WAS IN AND BECAUSE HIS SOLDIERS WERE DEPARTING FROM HIM
HAVING NO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MEN WITH THEM
AND WHEN SAMUEL HAD THUS PROPHESIED TO THE HEBREWS HE DISMISSED THEM TO THEIR OWN HOMES HAVING CONFIRMED THE KINGDOM TO SAUL THE SECOND TIME
AS ONE THAT WAS A TENDER AND GENTLE FATHER TO THEM TO RENDER GOD SO MERCIFUL AS TO FORGIVE THIS THEIR SIN WHICH THEY HAD ADDED TO THOSE OTHER OFFENSES WHEREBY THEY HAD AFFRONTED HIM AND TRANSGRESSED AGAINST HIM
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME HE WAS INFORMED WITH WHAT A CURSE HIS FATHER HAD FORBIDDEN THEM TO TASTE ANY THING BEFORE SUN SETTING SO HE LEFT OFF EATING AND SAID HIS FATHER HAD NOT DONE WELL IN THIS PROHIBITION
BUT THEN HE FELL INTO AN ACTION WHICH WAS A VERY UNHAPPY ONE AND LIABLE TO BE VERY MUCH BLAMED FOR WHETHER OUT OF IGNORANCE OR WHETHER OUT OF JOY FOR A VICTORY GAINED SO STRANGELY FOR IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT
THE HEBREWS COME OUT OF THEIR DENS AND CAVES AND THEY SAID TO JONATHAN AND TO HIS ARMOR BEARER COME ON ASCEND UP TO US THAT WE MAY INFLICT A JUST PUNISHMENT UPON YOU FOR YOUR RASH ATTEMPT UPON US
IF THEY HAD ANY DESIRE OF BEING PRESERVED AND MADE HAPPY WITH THEIR KING BUT HE SAID THAT IF THEY SHOULD GROW CARELESS OF THESE THINGS GREAT JUDGMENTS WOULD COME FROM GOD UPON THEM AND UPON THEIR KING
DIMINISHING THEIR FORCES AND DESPISING THEM AS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE AND AS NOT SO GREAT BUT THEY MIGHT HAZARD A BATTLE WITH THEM BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE ABOUT SAUL OBSERVED HOW NUMEROUS THE PHILISTINES WERE
BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY THAT HERE AROSE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE PLACE AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO ASCEND UP TO THE CAMP ON THAT QUARTER BUT SO MUCH AS TO COME NEAR IT AS SOON THEREFORE
THE REPORT BEING GONE ABROAD THAT THEY WERE COMING DOWN UPON HIM OF GILGAL TO WHICH SAMUEL REPLIED
SENT TO THE PROPHET AND CALLED HIM TO CONSULT WITH HIM ABOUT THE WAR AND THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS SO HE COMMANDED HIM TO STAY THERE FOR HIM AND TO PREPARE SACRIFICES FOR HE WOULD COME TO HIM WITHIN SEVEN DAYS
ON CONDITION TO HAVE THEIR RIGHT EYES PLUCKED OUT OR TO UNDERGO A SIEGE AND TO HAVE THEIR CITIES OVERTHROWN HE GAVE THEM THEIR CHOICE WHETHER THEY WOULD CUT OFF A SMALL MEMBER OF THEIR BODY OR UNIVERSALLY PERISH
AND DECLARED HIM TO BE KING THE SECOND TIME AND SO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HEBREWS WAS CHANGED INTO A REGAL GOVERNMENT FOR IN THE DAYS OF MOSES AND HIS DISCIPLE JOSHUA WHO WAS THEIR GENERAL THEY CONTINUED UNDER AN ARISTOCRACY
THEN HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANY BODY WAS GONE AWAY FROM THE ARMY AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS SON AND WITH HIM HIS ARMOR BEARER WERE ABSENT HE BADE THE HIGH PRIEST TAKE THE GARMENTS OF HIS HIGH PRIESTHOOD
THAT THEY MIGHT OFFER SACRIFICES ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND MIGHT THEN JOIN BATTLE WITH THEIR ENEMIES SO
BUT WHEN THE MESSENGERS WERE COME TO THE CITY OF KING SAUL AND DECLARED THE DANGERS IN WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH WERE THE PEOPLE WERE IN THE SAME AFFLICTION AS THOSE IN THE OTHER CITIES FOR THEY LAMENTED THE CALAMITY OF THOSE RELATED TO THEM
WHO WAS OF THE POSTERITY OF ELI THE HIGH PRIEST WERE SITTING UPON A PRETTY HIGH HILL AND SEEING THE LAND LAID WASTE THEY WERE MIGHTILY DISTURBED AT IT NOW SAUL'S SON AGREED WITH HIS ARMOR BEARER
HIS DAUGHTERS HE HAD ALSO ABNER HIS UNCLE'S SON FOR THE CAPTAIN OF HIS HOST THAT UNCLE'S NAME WAS NER NOW NER AND KISH THE FATHER OF SAUL WERE BROTHERS SAUL HAD ALSO A GREAT MANY CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN
THEY ALSO MADE A CLAMOR AGAINST THOSE THAT PRETENDED HE WOULD BE OF NO ADVANTAGE TO THEIR AFFAIRS AND THEY SAID WHERE NOW ARE THESE MEN LET THEM BE BROUGHT TO PUNISHMENT WITH ALL THE LIKE THINGS THAT
HOWEVER THE GILEADITES WERE SO AFFRIGHTED AT THESE OFFERS THAT THEY HAD NOT COURAGE TO SAY ANY THING TO EITHER OF THEM NEITHER THAT THEY WOULD DELIVER THEMSELVES UP NOR THAT THEY WOULD FIGHT HIM
AND WHEN THE SOLDIERS WERE NOT UNWILLING TO FOLLOW HIM BUT INDEED SHOWED GREAT READINESS TO DO AS HE COMMANDED THEM THE KING CALLED AHITUB THE HIGH PRIEST AND ENJOINED HIM TO KNOW OF GOD WHETHER HE WOULD GRANT THEM THE FAVOR AND PERMISSION
SUCH A TESTIMONY HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY THEM ALL SAID SINCE YOU GRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO LAY ANY ILL THING TO MY CHARGE HITHERTO COME ON NOW AND DO YOU HEARKEN WHILE I SPEAK WITH GREAT FREEDOM TO YOU
YET DID HE SWEAR THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE ANY OF HIS COUNTRYMEN SLAIN THAT DAY SINCE IT WAS ABSURD TO MIX THIS VICTORY WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN THEM WITH THE BLOOD AND SLAUGHTER OF THOSE THAT WERE OF THE SAME LINEAGE WITH THEMSELVES
WHICH HAD NONE TO GUARD IT BECAUSE OF ITS OWN STRENGTH FROM THENCE THEY CREPT UP WITH GREAT LABOR AND DIFFICULTY AND SO FAR OVERCAME BY FORCE THE NATURE OF THE PLACE TILL THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH THEIR ENEMIES
AND WHAT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE THAT MIGHT BE ESTEEMED INSTANCES OF GUILT OR PROFANENESS HIS ANSWER WAS THIS O FATHER I HAVE DONE NOTHING MORE THAN THAT YESTERDAY WITHOUT
THAT ENDED IN A SMALL BUT SHARP AND LONG EXTREMITY WHILE THERE WAS A ROCK THAT SURROUNDED THEM LIKE LINES MADE TO PREVENT THE ATTACKS OF AN ENEMY THERE IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE OUT GUARDS OF THE CAMP WERE NEGLECTED
KNOWING OF THE CURSE AND OATH THOU HADST DENOUNCED WHILE I WAS IN PURSUIT OF THE ENEMY I TASTED OF A HONEY COMB BUT SAUL SWARE THAT HE WOULD SLAY HIM AND PREFER THE OBSERVATION OF HIS OATH BEFORE ALL THE TIES OF BIRTH AND OF NATURE
AND SAID TO THEM I SOLEMNLY ADJURE YOU BY GOD ALMIGHTY WHO BROUGHT THOSE EXCELLENT BRETHREN I MEAN MOSES AND AARON INTO THE WORLD AND DELIVERED OUR FATHERS FROM THE EGYPTIANS AND FROM THE SLAVERY THEY ENDURED UNDER THEM
SO SAMUEL BEING GRIEVED AT WHAT HAPPENED RETURNED HOME BUT SAUL CAME TO THE CITY GIBEAH WITH HIS SON JONATHAN HAVING ONLY SIX HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM AND OF THESE THE GREATER PART HAD NO WEAPONS
WHERE HE BESIEGED AND TOOK A CERTAIN GARRISON OF THE PHILISTINES NOT FAR FROM GILGAL FOR THE PHILISTINES OF GIBEAH HAD BEATEN THE JEWS AND TAKEN THEIR WEAPONS AWAY AND HAD PUT GARRISONS INTO THE STRONGEST PLACES OF THE COUNTRY
OR SUCH WORKMEN NOW THE PHILISTINES DIVIDED THEIR ARMY INTO THREE COMPANIES AND TOOK AS MANY ROADS AND LAID WASTE THE COUNTRY OF THE HEBREWS WHILE KING SAUL AND HIS SON JONATHAN SAW WHAT WAS DONE BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO DEFEND THE LAND
YET HAVE I ORDAINED HIM FOR KING WHOM HE CHOSE FOR YOU HOWEVER THAT I MAY MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOU THAT GOD IS ANGRY AND DISPLEASED AT YOUR CHOICE OF KINGLY GOVERNMENT
HAD PERFORMED DIVINE OFFICES IN AN ILL MANNER AND HAD BEEN RASH IN PERFORMING THEM HEREUPON SAUL MADE AN APOLOGY FOR HIMSELF AND SAID THAT HE HAD WAITED AS MANY DAYS AS SAMUEL HAD APPOINTED HIM
WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT UNDER THE HANDS OF YOUR ENEMIES HE DELIVERED YOU FIRST BY RENDERING YOU SUPERIOR TO THE ASSYRIANS AND THEIR FORCES HE THEN MADE YOU TO OVERCOME THE AMMONITES AND THE MOABITES AND LAST OF ALL THE PHILISTINES
AND WHEN THEY EXPECTED NO SUCH THING AND JOINING BATTLE WITH THEM
THIS WAS TOLD TO THE KING BY THE SCRIBES THAT THE MULTITUDE WERE SINNING AGAINST GOD AS THEY SACRIFICED AND WERE EATING BEFORE THE BLOOD WAS WELL WASHED AWAY AND THE FLESH WAS MADE CLEAN THEN DID SAUL GIVE ORDER THAT A GREAT STONE SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
THAT THEY WOULD GO PRIVATELY TO THE ENEMY'S CAMP AND MAKE A TUMULT AND A DISTURBANCE AMONG THEM AND WHEN THE ARMOR BEARER HAD READILY PROMISED TO FOLLOW HIM WHITHERSOEVER HE SHOULD LEAD HIM THOUGH HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO DIE IN THE ATTEMPT
HE LED HIS ARMY AGAINST THOSE THAT WERE CALLED GILEADITES AND HAVING PITCHED HIS CAMP AT THE METROPOLIS OF HIS ENEMIES WHICH WAS THE CITY OF JABESH HE SENT AMBASSADORS TO THEM COMMANDING THEM EITHER TO DELIVER THEMSELVES UP
SO THEY FELL UPON THEM AS THEY WERE ASLEEP AND SLEW ABOUT TWENTY OF THEM AND THEREBY FILLED THEM WITH DISORDER AND SURPRISE INSOMUCH THAT SOME OF THEM THREW AWAY THEIR ENTIRE ARMOR AND FLED BUT THE GREATEST PART
WHETHER IT WERE THE COULTER OR THE SPADE OR ANY INSTRUMENT OF HUSBANDRY THEY CAME TO THE PHILISTINES TO DO IT NOW AS SOON AS THE PHILISTINES HEARD OF THIS SLAUGHTER OF THEIR GARRISON THEY WERE IN A RAGE ABOUT IT
AS ATTESTED THE TRUTH OF ALL THAT THE PROPHET HAD SAID INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE AMAZED AND TERRIFIED AND CONFESSED THEY HAD SINNED AND HAD FALLEN INTO THAT SIN THROUGH IGNORANCE AND BESOUGHT THE PROPHET
FOR WHAT NONE OF YOU EVER SAW HERE BEFORE I MEAN A WINTER STORM
MULTITUDES USUALLY SAY WHEN THEY ARE ELEVATED WITH PROSPERITY AGAINST THOSE THAT LATELY HAD DESPISED THE AUTHORS OF IT BUT SAUL ALTHOUGH HE TOOK THE GOOD WILL AND THE AFFECTION OF THESE MEN VERY KINDLY
THAT IF ANY ONE PUT A STOP TO HIS SLAUGHTER OF THE ENEMY AND FELL ON EATING AND LEFT OFF THE SLAUGHTER OR THE PURSUIT BEFORE THE NIGHT CAME ON AND OBLIGED THEM SO TO DO
THEY HAD SLAIN MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES THEY FELL UPON SPOILING THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES BUT NOT TILL LATE IN THE EVENING THEY ALSO TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF PREY AND CATTLE AND KILLED THEM AND ATE THEM WITH THEIR BLOOD
AND AGAINST WHOMSOEVER HE MADE WAR HE RETURNED CONQUEROR AND ADVANCED THE AFFAIRS OF THE HEBREWS TO A GREAT DEGREE OF SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY AND MADE THEM SUPERIOR TO OTHER NATIONS
AND WHEN SAUL WAS RETURNED FROM HIS HUSBANDRY INTO THE CITY HE FOUND HIS FELLOW CITIZENS WEEPING AND WHEN UPON INQUIRY HE HAD LEARNED THE CAUSE OF THE CONFUSION AND SADNESS THEY WERE IN HE WAS SEIZED WITH A DIVINE FURY
BUT THEY DESIRED THAT HE WOULD GIVE THEM SEVEN DAYS RESPITE THAT THEY MIGHT SEND AMBASSADORS TO THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND ENTREAT THEIR ASSISTANCE AND IF THEY CAME TO ASSIST THEM THEY WOULD FIGHT BUT IF THAT ASSISTANCE WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE OBTAINED FROM THEM
THAT GOD HIMSELF UPON THE PRAYERS OF OUR FATHERS SENT MOSES AND AARON WHO WERE BRETHREN AND GAVE THEM POWER TO DELIVER THE MULTITUDE OUT OF THEIR DISTRESS AND THIS WITHOUT
AND HE MADE PROCLAMATION THAT THEY SHOULD KILL THEIR SACRIFICES UPON IT AND NOT FEED UPON THE FLESH WITH THE BLOOD FOR THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE DID AS THE KING COMMANDED THEM SAUL ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE
OR WERE TAKEN BY HIM IN WAR AND THIS HE DID THAT WHEN THEIR LEFT EYES WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHIELDS THEY MIGHT BE WHOLLY USELESS IN WAR NOW WHEN THE KING OF THE AMMONITES HAD SERVED THOSE BEYOND JORDAN IN THIS MANNER
AND THAT IT WAS MORE AGREEABLE TO BE MEN OF A FRIENDLY DISPOSITION
JONATHAN MADE USE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S ASSISTANCE AND DESCENDED FROM THE HILL AND WENT TO THEIR ENEMIES NOW THE ENEMY'S CAMP WAS UPON A PRECIPICE WHICH HAD THREE TOPS
YET DID NOT HE HOWEVER OBSERVE THE COMMAND THAT WAS GIVEN HIM BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE PROPHET TARRIED LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED AND THAT HE WAS DESERTED BY THE SOLDIERS HE TOOK THE SACRIFICES AND OFFERED THEM
I AM INFORMED BY DOCTOR ZOUTEVEEN THAT THERE IS A CASE ON RECORD OF A MAN HAVING TWENTY FOUR FINGERS AND TWENTY FOUR TOES I WAS CHIEFLY LED TO THE CONCLUSION
THE GRADE OF CONCENTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY CERTAIN RODENTS HERE PERHAPS WE HAVE AN INSTANCE OF A SIMPLE ARREST OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT WITH SUBSEQUENT GROWTH AND PERFECT FUNCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EITHER SIDE OF THE PARTIALLY DOUBLE UTERUS
THOUGH PERHAPS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TWO SIMPLE MINUTE PRIMITIVE TUBES SHOULD KNOW HOW IF SUCH AN EXPRESSION MAY BE USED
THE BANYAI OF THE MORE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONTINENT ARE NEGROES BUT A GREAT MANY OF THEM ARE OF A LIGHT COFFEE AND MILK COLOUR AND INDEED THIS COLOUR IS CONSIDERED HANDSOME THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO THAT HERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF TASTE
TRIED IN VAIN TO ALTER THIS FASHION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF AFRICA AND IN THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO THE NATIVES FILE THE INCISORS INTO POINTS LIKE THOSE OF A SAW OR PIERCE THEM WITH HOLES INTO WHICH THEY INSERT STUDS
I HAVE MET WITH VERY FEW STATEMENTS OPPOSED TO THIS CONCLUSION
ARE FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED BY POLYDACTYLISM THIS HAS BEEN STRONGLY INSISTED ON BY MECKEL AND ISIDORE GEOFFROY SAINT HILAIRE BUT AT PRESENT IT IS THE SAFEST COURSE TO GIVE UP ALTOGETHER THE IDEA THAT THERE IS ANY RELATION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS
THEY INDICATE THE CLOSE SIMILARITY OF THE MIND OF MAN TO WHATEVER RACE HE MAY BELONG JUST AS DO THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL HABITS OF DANCING MASQUERADING AND MAKING RUDE PICTURES
NOW IN WOMEN ANOMALOUS CASES ARE NOT VERY INFREQUENT IN WHICH THE MATURE UTERUS IS FURNISHED WITH CORNUA OR IS PARTIALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO ORGANS AND SUCH CASES ACCORDING TO OWEN REPEAT
IN OUR NEAREST ALLIES THE QUADRUMANA ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO BE HERE EVEN SPECIFIED IN A SINGLE MALE SUBJECT HAVING A STRONG BODILY FRAME AND WELL FORMED SKULL NO LESS THAN SEVEN MUSCULAR VARIATIONS WERE OBSERVED
DURING AN EARLY PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT HAVING NO RELATION TO REVERSION YET SUCH VARIATIONS MIGHT BE PRESERVED AND ACCUMULATED IF IN ANY WAY SERVICEABLE FOR INSTANCE
NECKLACES ARMLETS EAR RINGS ET CETERA THEY PAINT THEMSELVES IN THE MOST DIVERSIFIED MANNER IF PAINTED NATIONS AS HUMBOLDT OBSERVES HAD BEEN EXAMINED WITH THE SAME ATTENTION AS CLOTHED NATIONS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED THAT THE MOST FERTILE IMAGINATION
INASMUCH AS ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT AND REVERSION ARE INTIMATELY RELATED PROCESSES THAT VARIOUS STRUCTURES IN AN EMBRYONIC OR ARRESTED CONDITION SUCH AS A CLEFT PALATE
AND OTHERS IN WOMAN WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE TO ASSIGN ANY REASON MISTER WOOD AFTER DESCRIBING NUMEROUS VARIATIONS
ALL OF WHICH PLAINLY REPRESENTED MUSCLES PROPER TO VARIOUS KINDS OF APES THIS MAN FOR INSTANCE HAD ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS NECK A TRUE AND POWERFUL
OR ARRESTED STRUCTURE WAS NORMAL THE SIMPLE BRAIN OF A MICROCEPHALOUS IDIOT IN AS FAR AS IT RESEMBLES THAT OF AN APE MAY IN THIS SENSE BE SAID TO OFFER A CASE OF REVERSION THIRTY EIGHT
DELIGHT TO FRISK ON ANY HILLOCK HOWEVER SMALL IDIOTS ALSO RESEMBLE THE LOWER ANIMALS IN SOME OTHER RESPECTS THUS SEVERAL CASES ARE RECORDED OF THEIR CAREFULLY SMELLING EVERY MOUTHFUL OF FOOD BEFORE EATING IT
HAVING MADE THESE PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE ADMIRATION FELT BY SAVAGES FOR VARIOUS ORNAMENTS AND FOR DEFORMITIES MOST UNSIGHTLY IN OUR EYES LET US SEE HOW FAR THE MEN ARE ATTRACTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR WOMEN
IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND IN AFRICA EITHER THE UPPER OR LOWER LIP IS PIERCED AND WITH THE BOTOCUDOS THE HOLE IN THE LOWER LIP IS SO LARGE THAT A DISC OF WOOD FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER IS PLACED IN IT
KNITTED THEIR BROWS AND SEEMED TO SHUDDER AT THE WHITENESS OF HIS SKIN ON THE EASTERN COAST THE NEGRO BOYS WHEN THEY SAW BURTON CRIED OUT LOOK AT THE WHITE MAN DOES HE NOT LOOK LIKE A WHITE APE
THE UTERUS GRADUATES FROM A DOUBLE ORGAN WITH TWO DISTINCT ORIFICES AND TWO PASSAGES AS IN THE MARSUPIALS
MAY BE SAID TO REPRESENT IN A RUDIMENTARY CONDITION THE SAME ORGAN IN ITS NORMAL STATE IN CERTAIN MAMMALS SOME PARTS WHICH ARE RUDIMENTARY IN MAN AS THE OS COCCYX IN BOTH SEXES AND THE MAMMAE IN THE MALE SEX ARE ALWAYS PRESENT WHILST OTHERS
THAT SOME LEMURS NORMALLY HAVE TWO PAIRS OF MAMMAE ON THE BREAST FIVE CASES HAVE BEEN RECORDED OF THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN A PAIR OF MAMMAE OF COURSE RUDIMENTARY IN THE MALE SEX OF MANKIND
NOT ONLY WITH THE NEGROES OF THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA
A GIRL HAS BEEN HEARD TO SAY I DO NOT WANT TO MARRY HIM HE HAS GOT NO NOSE AND THIS SHEWS THAT A VERY FLAT NOSE IS NOT ADMIRED WE SHOULD HOWEVER BEAR IN MIND THAT THE DEPRESSED BROAD NOSES AND PROJECTING JAWS OF THE NEGROES OF THE WEST COAST
AND ON THE BELIEF IN THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM THE FACT IS INTELLIGIBLE FOR IT HAS BEEN DETECTED IN SEVERAL OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
LASTLY IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT AS PROVED BY THE FOREGOING QUOTATIONS THAT THE SAME FASHIONS IN MODIFYING THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD IN ORNAMENTING THE HAIR IN PAINTING TATTOOING IN PERFORATING THE NOSE LIPS OR EARS
IT IS SATISFACTORY TO HEAR SO CAPABLE AN ANATOMIST AND SO EMBITTERED AN OPPONENT OF EVOLUTIONISM ADMITTING EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
MECKEL VON HEMSBACH THINKS THAT THIS LATTER CASE IS ILLUSTRATED BY A MEDIAL MAMMA OCCURRING IN CERTAIN CHEIROPTERA ON THE WHOLE WE MAY WELL DOUBT IF ADDITIONAL MAMMAE WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN BOTH SEXES OF MANKIND HAD NOT HIS EARLY PROGENITORS BEEN PROVIDED WITH MORE THAN A SINGLE PAIR
AND REVERSION TO SOME LOWLY ORGANISED PROGENITOR OF MAN
ARRESTS OF DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT AND ARRESTED GROWTH FOR PARTS IN THE FORMER STATE CONTINUE TO GROW WHILST STILL RETAINING THEIR EARLY CONDITION VARIOUS MONSTROSITIES COME UNDER THIS HEAD AND SOME AS A CLEFT PALATE
HAVE CREATED THE FASHIONS OF PAINTING AS WELL AS THOSE OF GARMENTS IN ONE PART OF AFRICA THE EYELIDS ARE COLOURED BLACK IN ANOTHER THE NAILS ARE COLOURED YELLOW OR PURPLE IN MANY PLACES THE HAIR IS DYED OF VARIOUS TINTS
TEND TO EXHIBIT IN A SUFFICIENTLY MARKED MANNER WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PROOFS AND EXAMPLES OF THE DARWINIAN PRINCIPLE OF REVERSION OR LAW OF INHERITANCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMICAL SCIENCE
ONLY OCCASIONALLY APPEAR AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED UNDER THE HEAD OF REVERSION THESE SEVERAL REVERSIONARY STRUCTURES AS WELL AS THE STRICTLY RUDIMENTARY ONES REVEAL THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM IN AN UNMISTAKABLE MANNER
THEY ADMIRE SOLELY WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO
AND HOW OFTEN AND HOW CLOSELY THE VARIATIONS RESEMBLE THE NORMAL MUSCLES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS HE SUMS UP BY REMARKING IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE IF I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SHEWING THE MORE IMPORTANT FORMS WHICH WHEN OCCURRING AS VARIETIES IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT
MADE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY AND THESE ARE CONSIDERED BY THE INHABITANTS OF KORDOFAN AND DARFUR
THESE VARIOUS CASES OF REVERSION ARE SO CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE OF RUDIMENTARY ORGANS GIVEN IN THE FIRST CHAPTER THAT MANY OF THEM MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDIFFERENTLY INTRODUCED EITHER THERE OR HERE THUS A HUMAN UTERUS FURNISHED WITH CORNUA
UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ARE LOST OR AS IT WERE ABSORBED INTO THE BODY OF THE UTERUS THE ANGLES OF THE UTERUS ARE STILL PRODUCED INTO CORNUA EVEN IN ANIMALS AS HIGH UP IN THE SCALE AS THE LOWER APES AND LEMURS
THAT THE BODY OF THE UTERUS IS FORMED IN MAN WHILE IN THOSE ANIMALS IN WHICH NO MIDDLE PORTION OR BODY EXISTS THE CORNUA REMAIN UNUNITED AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UTERUS PROCEEDS THE TWO CORNUA BECOME GRADUALLY SHORTER
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THE TEETH ARE STAINED BLACK RED BLUE ET CETERA AND IN THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO IT IS THOUGHT SHAMEFUL TO HAVE WHITE TEETH LIKE THOSE OF A DOG NOT ONE GREAT COUNTRY CAN BE NAMED FROM THE POLAR REGIONS IN THE NORTH TO NEW ZEALAND IN THE SOUTH
THEY DO NOT ADMIRE A MEDIUM STANDARD
NO TRACE OF IT IN ONLY TWO OUT OF THIRTY FEMALE SUBJECTS WAS THIS MUSCLE DEVELOPED ON BOTH SIDES BUT IN THREE OTHERS THE RUDIMENTARY LIGAMENT WAS PRESENT THIS MUSCLE THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE COMMON IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE SEX
THEY CANNOT ACQUIRE THE POWER OF SPEECH AND ARE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF PROLONGED ATTENTION BUT ARE MUCH GIVEN TO IMITATION THEY ARE STRONG AND REMARKABLY ACTIVE CONTINUALLY GAMBOLLING AND JUMPING ABOUT AND MAKING GRIMACES
THERE ARE OTHER CASES WHICH COME MORE STRICTLY UNDER OUR PRESENT HEAD OF REVERSION CERTAIN STRUCTURES REGULARLY OCCURRING IN THE LOWER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP TO WHICH MAN BELONGS OCCASIONALLY MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IN HIM THOUGH NOT FOUND IN THE NORMAL HUMAN EMBRYO OR
THEY OFTEN ASCEND STAIRS ON ALL FOURS AND ARE CURIOUSLY FOND OF CLIMBING UP FURNITURE OR TREES WE ARE THUS REMINDED OF THE DELIGHT SHEWN BY ALMOST ALL BOYS IN CLIMBING TREES AND THIS AGAIN REMINDS US HOW LAMBS AND KIDS ORIGINALLY ALPINE ANIMALS
ARE LEFT FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE CANINES OF THE OPPOSITE JAW AN INTER SPACE OF THIS KIND IN A KAFFIR SKULL
I ALSO ATTRIBUTED THOUGH WITH MUCH HESITATION
THAT A COMPLEX PART ARRESTED AT AN EARLY PHASE OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT SHOULD GO ON GROWING SO AS ULTIMATELY TO PERFORM ITS PROPER FUNCTION UNLESS IT HAD ACQUIRED SUCH POWER DURING SOME EARLIER STATE OF EXISTENCE WHEN THE PRESENT EXCEPTIONAL
AND BY A STRONGER FANG THAN THE INCISORS NEVERTHELESS THIS TOOTH NO LONGER SERVES MAN AS A SPECIAL WEAPON FOR TEARING HIS ENEMIES OR PREY IT MAY THEREFORE AS FAR AS ITS PROPER FUNCTION IS CONCERNED
THAT IT MAKES IT ALL THE HARDER BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING ONLY THIS MORNING SHE TOLD THE MINISTER THAT
HE BROKE OFF HOARSELY DROPPING HIS FACE INTO HIS HANDS AND SINKING INTO THE CHAIR BEHIND HIM OVER BY THE TABLE MARGARET STOOD SILENT MOTIONLESS HER EYES ON THE BOWED FIGURE OF THE MAN BEFORE HER
FOR ONE MOMENT MARGARET GAZED INTO THE MAN'S FACE WITH STARTLED EYES THEN SHE TURNED AND COVERED HER OWN TELLTALE FACE WITH HER HANDS AND BECAUSE IT WAS A TELLTALE FACE SPENCER TOOK A LONG STRIDE TOWARD HER
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE CORRECTED SOME OF COURSE IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE BUT SHE'LL COME OUT STRAIGHT HER HEART IS ALL RIGHT MISSUS KENDALL LAUGHED SOFTLY HER HEART DOCTOR SHE EXCLAIMED JUST THERE LIES THE GREATEST PROBLEM OF ALL
AND CIVILIZATION HER ALTRUISM WILL GET A FEW HARD KNOCKS BUT SHE'LL GET OVER THAT TOO YOU'LL SEE AT HEART SHE'S SO GENTLE AND WHY WHAT HE BROKE OFF WITH AN UNSPOKEN QUESTION
I TAKE DIVIDENDS FROM THE VERY MILLS THAT MAKE THE CHILDREN SUFFER A LONG TIME AGO I WANTED TO DIVVY UP WITH PATTY AND BOBBY AND THE REST I HAVE EVEN THOUGHT LATELY
AND PICKED UP A BIT OF PAPER FROM THE FLOOR OF COURSE IT IS USELESS SHE RETORTED IN WHAT SHE HOPED WAS A MERRY VOICE AND HE DOESN'T EVEN LOVE ME NOW BESIDES HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU FRANK SPENCER'S EYES AND VOICE WERE AMAZED
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE
IF THE MAN HEARD HE DID NOT HEED THE BONDS OF HIS SELF CONTROL HAD SNAPPED AND THE TORRENT OF WORDS CAME WITH A FORCE THAT TOLD HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE
STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART HARRY
ROSY AN KATY TER SCHOOL I WAS CAL'LATIN TER MAKE SOMETHIN OF EM MORE'N THEIR DAD AN THEIR MAMMY IS BUT I RECKON AS HOW I'LL HAVE TER SET EM TER WORK OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T REMONSTRATED MARGARET
AND WHO KNEW HER AS SHE WAS MISSUS KENDALL WENT FOR ADVICE WHAT SHALL I DO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY THE DEAR CHILD'S SPEECH MOVEMENTS AND ACTIONS ARE NOT WHAT I LIKE THEM TO BE AND YET
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN
BUT COULD SET NO DATE FOR THEIR RETURN FRANK IN PARTICULAR WAS DISTURBED THEY SAID HE HAD NOT PLANNED TO LEAVE EITHER HERSELF OR THE MILLS SO LONG IT BEING HIS INTENTION WHEN HE WENT AWAY MERELY TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP WITH HIS SISTER AND BROTHER
SHE HELD A BOOK BEFORE HER BUT SHE WAS NOT READING AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ONCE WHEN PATTY ENTERED THE ROOM I'M SORRY TER TROUBLE YE BEGAN PATTY HESITATINGLY BUT BOBBY MC GINNIS IS HERE AN WANTED ME TER ASK YE
WERE FEELING THE BENEFICIAL RESULTS OF THE LESSONS TO MARGARET HOWEVER THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HOPELESSLY SMALL THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO SO LITTLE DONE SHE WAS STILL THE LITTLE GIRL WITH THE TEASPOON AND THE BOWL OF SAND AND THE CHASM YAWNED
TO BECOME AT ONCE MARGARET KENDALL THE DAINTY LITTLE DAUGHTER OF A WELL BRED FASTIDIOUS MOTHER TO THE DOCTOR
AND AT THE LOOK IN HIS EYES MISSUS KENDALL DROPPED HER OWN THE HAPPINESS THAT HAD COME TO HER WITH THIS MAN'S LOVE WAS VERY NEW SHE HAD SCARCELY YET LOOKED IT SQUARELY IN THE FACE THE CHILD IS SO GOOD AND LOVING SHE WENT ON A LITTLE HURRIEDLY
AS SHE FELL BACK AND HIS EYES STILL BLAZED INTO HERS I AM AFRAID I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF HE CRIED I DON'T DARE TO TRUST MYSELF WITHIN SIGHT OF YOUR DEAR EYES OR WITHIN TOUCH OF YOUR DEAR HANDS THOUGH ALL THE WHILE I'M HUNGRY FOR BOTH
TO DO MY OBVIOUS DUTY AT ONCE THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS DOING THINGS FOR PEOPLE HE SAID FONDLY THEN HE GREW SUDDENLY GRAVE THE DEAR CHILD I'M AFRAID THAT ALONG WITH HER EDUCATION
BUT MARGARET I DON'T SEE WHY YOU MUST GO HE PROTESTED
LITTLE BULLETINS FROM THE SICK ROOM THEN HAD COME THE GOOD NEWS THAT FRANK WAS OUT OF DANGER THOUGH STILL FAR TOO WEAK TO UNDERTAKE THE LONG JOURNEY HOME THEIR LETTERS SHOWED UNMISTAKABLY THEIR IMPATIENCE AT THE DELAY AND QUESTIONED HER AS TO HER HEALTH AND WELFARE
HER ELBOWS WERE ON THE TABLE AND HER LINKED FINGERS WERE SHIELDING HER EYES INVOLUNTARILY THE MAN REACHED HIS HAND
NOW WITH MY PEOPLE DOWN THERE AT THE MILLS AND HER VOICE RANG WITH SELF SCORN THE MAN FROWNED HE TOO GOT TO HIS FEET AND WALKED NERVOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHEN HE CAME BACK THE GIRL HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN
WELL WHY DON'T YE CALL IT THE MILL HOUSE THEN AN DONE WITH IT DEMANDED PATTY PATTY YOU'RE A GENIUS I WILL CRIED MARGARET AND THE MILL HOUSE IT WAS FROM THAT DAY
HIS SHOULDERS STRAIGHTENED THANK YE MISS
AND THE SUPPER WHICH TO PATTY WAS SUMPTUOUS IN THE EXTRAVAGANCE SHE HAD ALLOWED HERSELF IN HER VISITOR'S HONOR DID NOT TEMPT HER APPETITE IN THE LEAST SHE TOLD HERSELF HOWEVER THAT ALL THIS WAS WELL AND GOOD AND SHE ATE THE SUPPER AND LAID HERSELF DOWN UPON THE HARD BED
SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE WILL LIKE AND FEEL AN INTEREST IN BUT I DON'T WANT ANY REFUGES OR HAVENS OR RESTS OR HOMES ABOUT IT IT IS A HOME BUT NOT THE KIND THAT BEGINS WITH A CAPITAL LETTER IT IS JUST ONE OF THE MILL HOUSES
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO ME FRANKLY AND FREELY AND TELL ME THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER THE MAN HAD HALF TURNED HIS FACE SO THAT ONLY HIS PROFILE SHOWED CLEAN CUT AND SQUARE CHINNED AGAINST THE CLOSE SHUT DOOR
AN THE BOY BOBBY BACK FROM THE CITY AND AIN'T SADIE GETTIN WELL AN STRONG ON THE FARM HERE AND IT'S A COMFORT TER ME TOO WHEN I REMEMBER TWAS BOBBY WHO FIRST FOUND THE LITTLE MARGARET
EARLIER IN THE WINTER THE LETTERS HAD BEEN MORE FREQUENT NERVOUSLY ANXIOUS EPISTLES OF SOME LENGTH FROM MISSUS MERIDETH STILTED NOTES HALF PROTESTING HALF PLEADING FROM NED AND SHORT BUT WONDERFULLY SYMPATHETIC COMMUNICATIONS FROM FRANK
BESIDES I'M GOING WITH PATTY WITH PATTY
SO VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE SHE SIGHED THE MILL HOUSE IS GOOD AND DOES GOOD I ACKNOWLEDGE BUT IT'S SO PUNY AFTER ALL IT'S LIKE A TINY LITTLE OASIS IN A HUGE DESERT OF POVERTY AND DISTRESS
AWAY AND DRANK UP THEIR CHILDREN'S HARD EARNED WAGES THERE WERE OTHERS
MARGARET LOOK AT ME LET ME SEE YOUR EYES THERE WAS A NOTE OF TRIUMPHANT JOY IN HIS VOICE NOW STILL NO ANSWER MARGARET IT DID NOT GO THAT LOVE IT STAYED WITH ME DAY AFTER DAY
AND HAD MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED THE TEACHING FORCE AS FOR HILCREST SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT STAY AT HILCREST ANYWAY NOW
AND THEN UNDER ONLY SUCH AS A CITY MISSIONARY AND AN OVERWORKED SCHOOLTEACHER COULD AFFORD SUPPLEMENTED BY THE TWO TRIPS TO MONT LAWN TO BE SURE BEHIND IT ALL HAD BEEN MARGARET'S CAREFUL TRAINING FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE
SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT THE FEELING SHE HAD FOR BOBBY WAS NOT LOVE AND SHE ASKED HERSELF SCORNFULLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO COULD GIVE THAT LOVE ALL UNSOUGHT TO A MAN
PRECIPITATELY TWO MINUTES LATER BOBBY MC GINNIS HIMSELF STOOD TALL AND STRAIGHT JUST INSIDE THE DOOR YOU SENT FOR ME HE ASKED MARGARET SPRANG TO HER FEET ALL THE PENT LONELINESS OF THE PAST WEEKS AND MONTHS
WE SHALL HAVE TEACHERS TO HELP US YOU KNOW PATTY AND I ARE GOING TO NEW YORK TO SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND HER SISTERS ARABELLA AND CLARABELLA WHAT ABSURD NAMES MISSUS MERIDETH SPOKE SHARPLY IN REALITY
IF I CORRECT EACH ONE TWILL BE A CONTINUAL DON'T ALL DAY WHY DOCTOR THE CHILD WILL HATE ME
PATTY AND HER FAMILY WILL LIVE WITH ME AND WE ARE GOING TO OPEN CLASSES IN SIMPLE LITTLE THINGS THAT WILL HELP TOWARD BETTER LIVING BUT THAT IS REGULAR SETTLEMENT WORK SIGHED MISSUS MERIDETH
OF NECESSITY A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT AND TO MISSUS KENDALL'S CONSTERNATION
DIDN'T I APPOINT US A COMMITTEE OF TWO TO DO THE WORK HER VOICE SHOOK AND HER CHIN TREMBLED LIKE THAT OF A GRIEVED CHILD YES AGAIN THAT STRAINED ALMOST HARSH MONOSYLLABLE MARGARET MADE AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
IT IS AT THE MILLS THEMSELVES THAT THE FIRST START MUST BE MADE THE FIRST BEGINNING OF THE DIVVYING UP PERHAPS IF THERE WERE SOME ONE TO SHOW US HE PAUSED THEN WENT ON UNSTEADILY
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM ALONE HERE THAT I HAVE NO FRIENDS BUT YOU AND PATTY SHE WENT ON TREMULOUSLY
AND QUESTIONED IF IT ALL INDEED WERE TRUE BIT BY BIT THE LITTLE GIRL'S HISTORY WAS RELATED IN EVERY HOUSE IN TOWN AND MANY A WOMAN AND SOME MEN WEPT OVER THE TALE OF HOW THE LITTLE FINGERS
GRADUALLY HER CONFUSED SENSES WERE COMING INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER SLOWLY HER DAZED THOUGHTS WERE TAKING SHAPE IT WAS HER OWN FAULT SHE HAD BROUGHT THIS THING UPON HERSELF
WITH THE OTHER I MAKE MORE CHILDREN HUNGRY AND MORE WOMEN SICK MARGARET ARE YOU MAD WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MERELY THIS IT IS VERY SIMPLE AFTER ALL WITH ONE HAND I RELIEVE THE CHILDREN'S SUFFERING WITH THE OTHER
AND THEN HURRY BACK TO AMERICA ALONE AS FOR FRANK HIMSELF HE HAD NOT WRITTEN HER SINCE HIS ILLNESS MARGARET WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS AND WAS FEELING SPECIALLY FORLORN
I HAIN'T GOT NOTHIN TER DO YIT MISS ONE SUCH SAID TO MARGARET IN ANSWER TO HER SYMPATHETIC INQUIRIES BUT THAR AIN'T A BOSS BUT WHAT SAID IF I'D GOT KIDS I MIGHT SEND THEM ALONG THEY WAS SHORT O KIDS I BEEN TRYIN TER KEEP
OR WERE NOT ABSURD BUT THEY CHANCED AT THE MOMENT TO BE A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT FOR HER ANGER AND DISCOMFITURE PATTY DOESN'T THINK THEM ABSURD LAUGHED MARGARET SHE WOULD TELL YOU THAT SHE NAMED THEM HERSELF
AND HE TURNED AWAY A WEEK LATER MARGARET LEARNED THAT ROSY AND KATY WERE OUT OF SCHOOL WHEN SHE LOOKED THEM UP SHE FOUND THEM AT WORK IN THE MILLS THIS MATTER OF THE SCHOOL QUESTION WAS A GREAT PUZZLE TO MARGARET VERY EARLY IN HER EFFORTS
MARGARET AND DID YOU THINK IT WAS NED I WAS PLEADING FOR WHEN ALL THE WHILE IT WAS I WHO WAS HUNGERING FOR YOU WITH A LOVE THAT SENT ME ACROSS THE SEAS TO RID MYSELF OF IT DID YOU MARGARET THERE WAS NO ANSWER
SHE COULD NOT SEEM TO REMEDY HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER EARNEST EFFORTS THE PARENTS IN MANY CASES WERE INDIFFERENT AND THE CHILDREN MORE SO SOME OF THE CHILDREN IN THE MILLS INDEED WERE THERE SOLELY ACCORDING TO THE PARENTS VERSION
EVEN THE MOST URGENT ENTREATIES ON THE PART OF MARGARET FAILED TO START THE SPENCERS ON THEIR TRIP AND NOT UNTIL SHE FINALLY THREATENED TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE HERSELF AND GO DOWN TO THE TOWN DID THEY CONSENT TO GO
WHAT MORE COULD YOU DO VENTURED THE MAN MARGARET ROSE AND MOVED RESTLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID AT LAST
CERTAINLY BUT SHE WAS OVERWHELMED NOT ONLY THE CAKES AND THE TIDIES HOWEVER GAVE MISSUS KENDALL FOOD FOR THOUGHT DURING THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER MARGARET'S RETURN
BUT SUPPOSE YOU JUST ASK BOBBY MC GINNIS TO COME HERE TO ME AND ASK HIS QUESTION DIRECT I WILL SEE HIM NOW AND PATTY WONDERING VAGUELY WHAT HAD COME TO HER GENTLE EYED GENTLE VOICED MISTRESS AS SHE INSISTED UPON CALLING MARGARET FLED
ONLY A FEW ENROLLED THEMSELVES AS PUPILS NEVER MIND SAID MARGARET WE SHALL GROW YOU'LL SEE THE MILL PEOPLE HOWEVER WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT LEARNED SOMETHING DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS MARGARET HERSELF LEARNED MUCH
BURST FORTH IN A STINGING WHIP OF RETORT YES I SENT FOR YOU SHE PAUSED BUT THE MAN DID NOT SPEAK AND IN A MOMENT SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY FEVERISHLY I ALWAYS SEND FOR YOU IF I SEE YOU AT ALL AND YET YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'M TRYING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
THE HOUSEHOLD AT HILCREST DID NOT BREAK UP AS EARLY AS USUAL THAT YEAR A FEW DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN HORRIFIED REMONSTRANCES AND TEARFUL PLEADINGS ON THE PART OF MISSUS MERIDETH AND NED WHEN MARGARET'S PLANS BECAME KNOWN THEN
HAD COME A BREATHING SPACE WHEN THE INTRICATE MACHINERY OF HER SCHEME COULD RUN FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT HER HAND AT THE THROTTLE SHE WAS LEFT WEAK AND NERVELESS SHE WAS IN FACT PERILOUSLY NEAR A BREAKDOWN
FROM FLOWERS AND FROSTED CAKES
FOR SOME TIME AFTER MC GINNIS WENT AWAY MARGARET REMAINED AT THE MILL HOUSE BUT SHE WAS RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY IN THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF MC GINNIS TAUGHT AN EVENING CLASS AT THE MILL HOUSE AND SHE KNEW
IN ONE PARISH YOU MUSTN'T THINK OF GOING AWAY FROM US MISSUS BOYCE SAID SPEAKING BY NO MEANS LOUD BUT SLOWLY AND PLAINLY HOPING THEREBY TO
AUNT HANNAH TOOK NAPS AT SUCH TIMES IT WAS VERY EASY TO SLIP UP STAIRS TO CYRIL'S ROOMS AND ONCE AT THE PIANO BILLY FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE
IN SAYING ALL WHICH CAPTAIN DALE WAS NO DOUBT VERY FALSE BUT IF FALSENESS CAN BE FORGIVEN TO A MAN IN ANY POSITION IT MAY BE FORGIVEN IN THAT WHICH HE THEN FILLED
AND WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO DO THE MECHANICAL PART OF THE WORK IN A MANNER THAT SHOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO HER PARTNER OH THANK YOU IT'S VERY NICE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GO ON AGAIN DIRECTLY
I DID HAVE A TWINGE IN THE SPRING
HE CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN DID YOU EVER KNOW CHRISTOPHER DALE CHANGE HIS MIND
SO SHE SHALL SAID LILY WHO HAD TAKEN MARY BY THE HAND AND WE KNEW WE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WAY JOHNNY CAN GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT TO BE DONE HE SHAN'T BE BANISHED UNLESS HE LIKES IT SAID MISSUS DALE
THEY ARE GENERALLY HAPPY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HAPPINESS OR IF NOT THEY OUGHT TO BE AT ANY RATE THEY ARE SIMPLY PERFORMING A MANIFEST DUTY WHICH DUTY IN THEIR TIME WAS PERFORMED ON THEIR BEHALF
MISSUS HEARN SAID TO MISSUS DALE BEFORE THE EVENING WAS OUT THERE ARE SOME OLD PEOPLE WHOM IT IS VERY HARD TO FLATTER AND WITH WHOM IT IS NEVERTHELESS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE
THEY WERE STANDING IN THE NARROW PATHWAY OF THE GATE LEADING FROM THE BRIDGE INTO THE GARDENS OF THE GREAT HOUSE AND THE SHADOW OF THE THICK SPREADING LAURELS
WHEN WHEN AUNT ELLA DIED AND ALL YOU PLAY THEN IS JUST BY EAR BY EAR
BUT THE POOR CURATE REMAINED TALKING A DULL WORD EVERY NOW AND THEN TO MISSUS DALE AND LOOKING ON WITH TANTALIZED EYES AT THE JOYS WHICH THE WORLD HAD PREPARED FOR OTHERS THAN HIM
AND THEN THEY MANAGED TO GO THROUGH ONE QUADRILLE BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT IT DID NOT ANSWER THE MUSIC OF THE SINGLE FIDDLE WHICH CROSBIE HAD HIRED FROM GUESTWICK WAS NOT
FLATTER THE OLD WOMAN BUT THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD IT ALL
BUT AS HE SAID IT HE PRESSED HER CLOSER TO HIS SIDE AND HIS TONE WAS PLEASANT TO HER
BUT HE COULD NOT STAND AND SAY LITTLE WORDS WHEN HE HAD IN TRUTH NOTHING TO SAY HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS GROUND WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS NOT USING THE GROUND UPON WHICH HE STOOD
WAS NOT PLEASANT TO THE FEET FOR DANCING THIS IS VERY NICE SAID BERNARD TO HIS COUSIN I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT COULD BE NICER BUT PERHAPS I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID LILY BUT I SHALL STAY HERE
WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE PARISH FOR FIFTY YEARS HERE HE IS AND MISSUS HEARN MAJESTICALLY RAISED HERSELF FROM HER SEAT AS THE SQUIRE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH HIM
THE SQUIRE'S COMING I SUPPOSE ISN'T HE SAID MISSUS HEARN AS SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SOFA CLOSE TO MISSUS DALE YES HE'LL BE HERE BY AND BY UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS MIND YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T STAND ON CEREMONY WITH ME
THEN SHE WALKED OFF BY ONE OF THE PATHS AND HER LOVER WENT AFTER HER DON'T YOU LIKE THE MOON SHE SAID AS SHE TOOK HIS ARM TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW SO ACCUSTOMED THAT SHE HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT AS SHE TOOK IT
WHETHER IT WAS A MULTITUDE OF MEN OR OF WOMEN HE COULD BE VERY FIXED TOO IN HIS OWN OPINION AND EAGER IF NOT VIOLENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS PURPOSE
ONE DAY HOWEVER THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED CYRIL CAME HOME UNEXPECTEDLY THE MAN HEARD THE PIANO FROM WILLIAM'S FLOOR AND WITH A SURPRISED EJACULATION
WERE BY FAR THE MORE HANDSOME LILY WENT ACROSS TO HIM AND GREETED HIM HEARTILY DECLARING HOW GLAD SHE WAS TO HAVE HIM THERE
VERY FORTUNATE VERY FORTUNATE OF COURSE WE THINK SO SAID BELL NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS RICH NO NOT BECAUSE HE IS RICH BUT BECAUSE BEING WORTHY OF SUCH HAPPINESS
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAID CROSBIE
AND MISSUS BOYCE GIVING THE USUAL ANSWER DECLARED THAT SHE ALREADY FELT THAT THEY HAD COME AS AN AVALANCHE
IF YOU MEAN WHAT I HEAR EASY THINGS I CAN PLAY QUICK BUT BUT THOSE CHORDS ARE HARD THEY SKIP AROUND SO CYRIL SMILED ODDLY
GREAT HOMAGE OF BITTER GRIEF IN THAT HE HAD LOST HER
I DOUBT THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROFFERED ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION JOHN EAMES SEEMED TO BE OF THIS OPINION FOR HE DID NOT AT ONCE ACCEPT THE INVITATION WILL YOU NOT OBLIGE ME SO FAR AS THAT
SHOULD ANY SUCH FATE EITHER BY FALSENESS OR MISFORTUNE COME UPON HER NO SUCH CAUTION COULD BE OF SERVICE TO SAVE HER THE CUP WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SHATTERED IN ITS FALL THAT NO FURTHER PIECING OF ITS PARTS
BUT ON WHAT ACCOUNT DO THE MISSUS HEARNS BETAKE THEMSELVES TO SUCH GATHERINGS WHY DID THAT ANCIENT LADY SIT THERE HOUR AFTER HOUR YAWNING LONGING FOR HER BED LOOKING EVERY TEN MINUTES AT HER WATCH
UNCONTROLLED HEARTINESS OF HIS FEELINGS AT LENGTH HE DID COME UP TO HER AND THOUGH IN TRUTH SHE WAS ENGAGED SHE AT ONCE ACCEPTED HIS OFFER THEN SHE TRIPPED ACROSS THE ROOM ADOLPHUS SHE SAID
THE PERFECT HAPPINESS OF THE LONDON MAN OF FASHION
THE OTHER IS MINE AND YET IT IS A DELIGHT TO LOVE YOU TO KNOW THAT I MAY LOVE YOU YOU MEAN THAT THIS IS THE REALIZATION OF YOUR ROMANCE YES
NOT IF YOU WEREN'T HERE WITH YOUR NERVES THE MAN LAUGHED AND CAME SLOWLY INTO THE ROOM BILLY WHO TAUGHT YOU TO PLAY NO ONE I CAN'T PLAY
ARE YOU ARE AN ACCEPTED LOVER AND WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING WHIP THE CREAMS AND TUNE THE PIANO IF YOU KNOW HOW
CONTINUED THE IMPASSIONED GIRL
THAT IS WHAT I SAY TO BELL WHEN I TELL HER THAT HER ROMANCE WILL FADE AS THE ROSES DO
A WALTZ THAT HE OFTEN PLAYED HIMSELF IT WAS NOT PLAYED CORRECTLY IT IS TRUE THERE WERE NOTES AND SOMETIMES WHOLE MEASURES THAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRINTED MUSIC BUT THE TUNE THE RHYTHM AND THE SPIRIT WERE THERE
ALL TIN PANNY AND THIN YOU KNOW I PLAYED SOME ON IT AND WANTED TO TAKE LESSONS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO PRACTISE ON THAT I WANTED A NEW ONE THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO
AS THOUGH SHE WAS DETERMINED TO CARRY HER POINT THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER COLDLY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AS YOUNG MEN ARE APT TO DO WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THAT WAY THEN THEY SEPARATED AT ONCE
THUS THEY PASSED THE AFTERNOON TOGETHER WITHOUT FURTHER MENTION OF BERNARD DALE AND IT MAY BE SAID AT ANY RATE OF LILY AND CROSBIE THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT MISSED
MY LOVE AS CROSBIE WALKED BACK TO THE GREAT HOUSE THAT NIGHT HE MADE A FIRM RESOLUTION THAT NO CONSIDERATION OF WORLDLY WELFARE SHOULD EVER INDUCE HIM
FOR HE SMOKES AND HUNTS AND DOES ALL MANNER OF WICKED THINGS AND THEN SHE WENT FORWARD TO WELCOME HER FRIEND DOCTOR CROFTS WAS A SLIGHT SPARE MAN
BILLY'S FACE WAS RAPTUROUSLY INTENT AND HAPPY BY JOVE BILLY GASPED THE MAN BILLY LEAPED TO HER FEET AND WHIRLED AROUND GUILTILY OH
SHE DID NOT MOREOVER LIKE TO BE THOUGHT RHEUMATIC THIS
GET ME A NEW PIANO OR LET ME DO IT SHE SAID SHE PRACTISED ON THAT PIANO AND THAT IT WAS QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ESPECIALLY TO LEARN ON
WHILE HER OLD BONES WERE STIFF AND SORE AND HER OLD EARS PAINED WITH THE NOISE IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUPPER AFTER THE SUPPER HOWEVER HER MAID TOOK HER ACROSS TO HER COTTAGE
IS IT THAT HE DOES IT SAID JOHN
WHAT MAN DOES NOT LIKE SUCH ASSURANCES ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED HAD LILY SHOWN MORE RETICENCE
NEVERTHELESS CROSBIE HAD IN SOME WAY CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT THIS CROFTS EITHER HAD BEEN OR WAS OR WAS TO BE IN LOVE WITH BELL
AND MISSUS BOYCE ALSO THEN STOLE AWAY HOME AND THE SQUIRE WENT OFF WITH SOME LITTLE PARADE SUGGESTING TO THE YOUNG MEN THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE NO NOISE IN THE HOUSE AS THEY RETURNED
IF HE FINDS US WOMEN TOO MUCH FOR HIS UNAIDED STRENGTH JOHN EAMES MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT BEING VERY WELL AS HE WAS AND THEN GOT HIMSELF INTO AN ARM CHAIR HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS WITH LILY TRYING AS HE DID SO
DROPPING HERSELF ON TO THE PIANO STOOL AND WHISKING ABOUT BILLY WAS NOT AFRAID NOW NOR DEFIANT SHE WAS ONLY EAGER AND HAPPY AGAIN IN A MOMENT A DREAMY WALTZ FELL UPON CYRIL'S EARS
SHE HAD SOMETIMES SPOKEN TO HER LOVER
ENTERED MISTER AND MISSUS BOYCE FROM THE PARSONAGE WITH DICK BOYCE THE UNGROWN GENTLEMAN AND TWO GIRL BOYCES WHO WERE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
THAT IT MIGHT BE POSTPONED TO SOME GREEK KALENDS AND YET HE DID NOT WISH TO INJURE LILY THE REASON I MENTION IT IS THIS THAT WE SHOULD BE SO VERY GLAD IF YOU COULD BE HERE
TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME NAMED AND OF COURSE YOU MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT I MEANT THIRTY MINUTES AFTER IT
I MUST SPEAK TO HER TO MORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE ACCEPTED HER SALUTE WITH A MOCK GRAVITY EQUAL TO HER OWN POOR LILY HOW LITTLE SHE UNDERSTOOD AS YET WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HAD SHE KNOWN HIS WISH
LIKE THE MOON WELL I FANCY I LIKE THE SUN BETTER I DON'T QUITE BELIEVE IN MOONLIGHT I THINK IT DOES BEST TO TALK ABOUT WHEN ONE WANTS TO BE SENTIMENTAL AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I FEAR
WOULD BE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE SO MUCH AS THIS SHE DID NOT EXACTLY SAY TO HERSELF BUT SHE
HE HURRIED UPSTAIRS TWO STEPS AT A TIME AT THE DOOR HE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT BILLY WAS AT THE PIANO BUT SHE WAS NOT PLAYING RAG TIME THE STORM
THAT YOU'LL RAFFLE OFF YOUR COLLECTION OF TEAPOTS AT THE NEXT CHURCH FAIR OR THAT I SHALL GO TO EGYPT AS A COOKY GUIDE
THAT IS MY INTERPRETATION OF THE WORDS WHEN I AM THANKED FOR COMING EARLY BUT MISSUS EAMES WAS A KIND PATIENT UNEXACTING WOMAN WHO TOOK ALL CIVIL WORDS AS MEANING CIVILITY AND INDEED
DARES TO MARRY ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT RICH AND THEN SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH THE DOCTOR AFTER THAT DOCTOR CROFTS GOT OFF TOWARDS THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE BY HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST THE WALL
WE'LL HAVE A PIANO TOMORROW IN YOUR ROOMS FOR YOU TO PRACTISE ON AND I'LL TEACH YOU MYSELF OH THANK YOU MISTER CYRIL
HE SHOULD PREFER THE OWNER OF ALLINGTON AND NEPHEW OF LORD DE GUEST AS A BROTHER IN LAW TO A VILLAGE DOCTOR AS HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF IN HIS PRIDE TO CALL DOCTOR CROFTS
IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE SAID HE BUT I NEVER DO LIKE PARAGONS
AND PETTED THE GIRLS AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN CHILDREN WHEN TOLD OF LILY'S MARRIAGE SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HANDS WITH SURPRISE FOR SHE HAD STILL LEFT IN SOME CORNER OF HER DRAWERS REMNANTS OF SUGAR PLUMS WHICH SHE HAD BOUGHT FOR LILY
ELATING HER INTO A SEVENTH HEAVEN OF HAPPINESS WHAT COULD THE WORLD AFFORD
MISTER CYRIL I'M SO SORRY SORRY AND YOU PLAY LIKE THAT NO NO I'M NOT SORRY I PLAYED IT'S BECAUSE YOU FOUND ME
SO CROSBIE WENT DOWN TO THE SMALL HOUSE ALONE DALE WOULDN'T COME SAID HE SPEAKING TO THE THREE LADIES TOGETHER I SUPPOSE HE'S KEEPING HIMSELF UP FOR THE DANCE ON THE LAWN I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE IN THE EVENING SAID MISSUS DALE
YOU LIKED ME BETTER WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PIGS DIDN'T YOU NO I LIKE YOU BEST NOW AND WHY DIDN'T YOU LIKE ME THEN DID I SAY ANYTHING TO OFFEND YOU I LIKE YOU BEST NOW BECAUSE
AND HIS UNCHECKED ARM STOLE ROUND HER WAIST IT IS THE MEANING OF THE MOONLIGHT
TO INDUCE HIM TO DO HER THIS FAVOUR FOR SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A FAVOUR HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE DESIRE ON HIS PART TO ASK HER AND AT THE SAME TIME HOW GREAT THE REPUGNANCE
AS SOON AS THEY WERE AGAIN STANDING TOGETHER NO I DARE SAY NOT SAID EAMES BUT NOT THIS YEAR I SUPPOSE INDEED I SHOULD SAY OF COURSE NOT IN THE SPRING PERHAPS SUGGESTED EAMES HE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE
I HATED THAT PIANO SO
I WILL NOT THINK IT DRY AND CRUEL EVEN THOUGH SORROW SHOULD COME UPON US IF YOU I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I AM GOOD TO YOU I AM NOT AFRAID OF THAT I AM NOT THE LEAST AFRAID OF THAT
BUT CAME BACK DISAPPOINTED FINALLY HE FOUND WORK IN A PLOW STORE AT A SALARY OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR CAPTAIN COFFIN MEANTIME HAD DIED LEAVING HIS FAMILY POOR JAMES COULD DO SO LITTLE FOR THEM ALL WITH HIS LIMITED SALARY
AND DRAWING HER CHAIR CLOSE TO IT WITH HER BABY ON HER LAP WOULD STUDY THE BOOK DILIGENTLY A WOMAN OF LESS ENERGY AND LESS WILL POWER THAN YOUNG MISSUS MOTT WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF BEING A SCHOLAR SHE READ THE BEST BOOKS IN PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE
AND QUITE POSSIBLY MORE OF EACH OTHER BEGAN TO STUDY FRENCH TOGETHER HE WAS TALL WITH LIGHT HAIR AND BLUE EYES AND SHY IN MANNER SHE PETITE WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES QUICK IN THOUGHT AND ACTION AND FOND OF MIRTH
OWING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF ANGLE AT WHICH THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE THE EARTH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VIOLENT CHANGES THAT OCCUR SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE PROGRESS OF A SEASON AS WELL AS THE LESS VIOLENT ONES THAT COME EVERY FEW DAYS
NOW AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED KNITTING TWENTY BOUTS
THE WHOLE SYSTEM MOVES IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE WINDS ARE BLOWING SPIRALLY ABOUT THE STORM CENTER IF WE SHOULD BE IN THE TRACK OF A MOVING STORM SO THAT ITS CENTER PASSED OVER US THE WINDS AT THE BEGINNING WOULD BLOW IN ONE DIRECTION
WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN AND JAMES TWENTY ONE THE YOUNG TEACHERS WERE MARRIED AND BOTH WENT TO HER FATHER'S HOME IN PHILADELPHIA TO RESIDE HE ASSISTING IN MISTER COFFIN'S BUSINESS
WHICH CAUSES THE FLOW OF COLDER AIR TO BE QUICKENED AND HENCE THE INCREASING FORCE OF THE WIND AS THE SUN MOUNTS HIGHER IN THE HEAVENS
DURING THESE MONTHS THE LAND IS CONTINUALLY HEATED DAY AND NIGHT TO A HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN THE WATER IN THE OCEAN SOUTH OF IT THE WINDS ARE PROBABLY NOT SO SEVERE DURING THE NIGHT AS THROUGH THE DAY AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LAND AND THE WATER WILL NOT BE SO GREAT DURING THE NIGHT
THERE ARE TWO OTHER REGIONS OF CALMS IN THE OCEAN ONE AT THE NORTH AT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AND ANOTHER AT THE SOUTH NEAR THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AS HAS BEEN STATED THERE ARE CURRENTS FLOWING BACK IN THE UPPER REGIONS AT THE EQUATOR NORTH AND SOUTH AND THESE ARE CALLED THE UPPER TRADES
IT MOVES SPIRALLY AND UPWARDLY ABOUT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA UNTIL IT REACHES A POINT IN THE UPPER AIR
HER KINDNESS AND HER SWEET VOICE LEFT A DEEP IMPRESSION AS HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM HE ASKED AT THE DOOR WHO IS THAT LADY WHY THAT IS LUCRETIA MOTT FOR A SECOND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED BUT HE ADDED WELL SHE'S A GOOD SENSIBLE WOMAN
SHE SAYS I OMITTED MUCH UNNECESSARY STITCHING AND ORNAMENTAL WORK IN THE SEWING FOR MY FAMILY SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE MORE TIME FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF MY MIND
AT THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE THE AIR WILL BE CONDENSED BY THE DESCENDING CURRENT BEING ARRESTED BY THE EARTH THE DESCENDING CURRENT COMING AS IT DOES FROM THE UPPER AND COLDER REGIONS ACCOUNTS FOR THE COOL WEATHER THAT MOST ALWAYS PREVAILS AT A HIGH PRESSURE AREA
AND WHICH IN TURN CAUSES THE DENSER OR COLDER AIR FROM THE LAND TO FLOW TOWARD THE OCEAN AND DISPLACE THE LIGHTER AIR AND FORCE IT UPWARD HENCE WE HAVE A LAND INSTEAD OF A SEA BREEZE
AND THE AIR IS ASCENDING AT THE CENTER OF THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WHILE IT IS POURING IN ON ALL SIDES FROM THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WHERE THE AIR IS COMPRESSED BY A DOWNWARD CURRENT FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THE HIGH PRESSURE OR ANTI CYCLONE SYSTEM
WHERE THERE IS A CONFLICT OF THE ELEMENTS AS THERE ALWAYS IS WHEN COLD AND WARM CURRENTS MEET THE ONLY POINT WHERE THE TRADE WIND HAS FREE PLAY IS IN THE SOUTH INDIAN OCEAN AND THIS IS CALLED THE HEART OF THE TRADES
THAT NO WOMEN WERE TO BE ADMITTED TO THE CONVENTION AS DELEGATES THEY HAD FACED MOBS AND OSTRACISM THEY HAD GIVEN MONEY AND EARNEST LABOR BUT THEY WERE TO BE IGNORED WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON HURT AT SUCH INJUSTICE
LUCRETIA WOULD BE SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT AS NOT TO NOTICE THE BEAUTIES OF THE LANDSCAPE WHICH HER HUSBAND ALWAYS GREATLY ENJOYED POINTING OUT A FINE VIEW TO HER SHE REPLIED YES IT IS BEAUTIFUL NOW THAT THOU POINTS IT OUT
THIS CAUSES A CALM AT THAT POINT WHERE IT TURNS THE UPPER PARTS OF THIS CURRENT CONTINUE ON IN A NORTHERLY AND SOUTHERLY DIRECTION ON THE SURFACE UNTIL THEY MEET WITH THE COLD AIR OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLAR REGIONS
WHEN WE SHOULD FEEL THE WIND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION UNTIL THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE HAD MOVED FORWARD INTO THE REGION OF HIGH PRESSURE
ALL THESE CONDITIONS COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE EARTH ROTATES ON ITS AXIS ONCE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARE CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE COMPLICATED PHENOMENA OF AERIAL CHANGES ON THE VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE
A BAROMETER MAY READ LOW AT ONE STATION BY THE SCALE BUT MAY BE HIGH WITH REFERENCE TO SOME OTHER BAROMETER THAT READS VERY LOW WHAT IS A BAROMETER IF WE SHOULD TAKE A GLASS TUBE CLOSED AT ONE END THE AREA OF THE CROSS SECTION OF WHICH IS ONE INCH SQUARE
FOR NOVELS AND LIGHT READING I NEVER HAD MUCH TASTE THE LADIES DEPARTMENT IN THE PERIODICALS OF THE DAY HAD NO ATTRACTION FOR ME SHE WOULD LAY A COPY OF WILLIAM PENN'S PONDEROUS VOLUMES OPEN AT THE FOOT OF HER BED
THE ASTONISHED MAN HAD LIKE OTHERS A TENDER HEART BENEATH THE ROUGHNESS AND WITH RESPECTFUL MANNER TOOK HER TO A PLACE OF SAFETY THE NEXT DAY GOING INTO A RESTAURANT SHE SAW THE LEADER OF THE MOB AND IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN BY HIM AND BEGAN TO CONVERSE
IF WE STUDY THE AIR MOTIONS IN THESE SYSTEMS SUFFICIENTLY TO GET AT LEAST AN INKLING OF THE LAW OF THEIR MOVEMENTS IT BECOMES A VERY INTERESTING SUBJECT
THE VELOCITY OF ITS MOVEMENT IS VERY MUCH ACCELERATED UNTIL IT HAS MOVED INTO THE ZONE OF QUIET AIR IN THE CENTER WHERE IT IS ASCENDING IN THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE COUNTER CURRENTS FLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
THERE IS NO TENDENCY IN ANY SUBSTANCE TO RISE OF ITSELF BUT THE LIGHTER SUBSTANCE RISES BECAUSE IT IS FORCED TO DO SO BY THE HEAVIER WHICH DISPLACES IT THIS LAW LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL OF THE PHENOMENA OF AIR CURRENTS IF WE ARE AT CERTAIN POINTS ON THE SEASHORE IN THE SUMMER TIME
THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BROUGHT FINANCIAL FAILURE TO MANY AND YOUNG MOTT SOON FOUND HIMSELF WITH A WIFE AND INFANT DAUGHTER TO SUPPORT AND NO WORK HOPING THAT HE COULD OBTAIN A SITUATION WITH AN UNCLE IN NEW YORK STATE HE TOOK HIS FAMILY THITHER
AFTER SOME MONTHS OF DEVOTED CHRISTIAN WORK ALONG WITH SIGHT SEEING MISTER AND MISSUS MOTT STARTED HOMEWARD HE HAD SPOKEN LESS FREQUENTLY THAN HIS WIFE BUT ALWAYS HAD BEEN LISTENED TO WITH DEEP INTEREST
MISSUS MOTT WAS JUBILANT AT THE THOUGHT OF THE WORLD'S INTEREST IN THIS GREAT QUESTION AND GLAD FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS THE OCEAN AND ENJOY A LITTLE REST AND THE PLEASURE OF MEETING FRIENDS WHO HAD WORKED IN THE SAME CAUSE WHEN THE PARTY ARRIVED THEY WERE TOLD TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT
FOR THIS REASON A SINGLE BAROMETER IS NOT OF MUCH USE IF IT BEGINS TO FALL FROM ANY POINT AND FALLS RAPIDLY IT INDICATES THAT AN AREA OF A MUCH LOWER PRESSURE IS APPROACHING THE SAME IS TRUE OF A HIGH PRESSURE AREA IF THE BAROMETER RISES RAPIDLY FROM ANY POINT
AT SOME POINT EQUIDISTANT BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND THE EQUATOR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WILL BE MOVING AT A RATE SAY OF FIVE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
AT THIS POINT IT WILL BE WARMER AND WINDS WILL PREVAIL WITH RAIN OR SNOW THE WINDS VARYING IN DIRECTION AND INTENSITY AT A GIVEN POINT AS THE CYCLONE MOVES FORWARD IN THE CENTER OF THESE CYCLONES AND ANTI CYCLONES THERE WILL BE A REGION OF COMPARATIVE CALM
THE FORCES THAT WORK TO PRODUCE ALL THE VARYING PHENOMENA OF AIR CURRENTS ON DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE EARTH ARE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN AS THERE ARE SO MANY LOCAL CONDITIONS OF HEAT AND COLD AND THESE ARE MODIFIED BY THE ADVANCING AND RECEDING SEASONS
EXPANDED BY THE HEAT THE WARM AIR AT THE EQUATOR IS FORCED UP INTO THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HERE IT OVERFLOWS EACH WAY NORTH AND SOUTH CAUSING A CURRENT OF AIR IN THE UPPER REGIONS COUNTER TO THAT OF THE LOWER
AND SEE WHAT PART IT PLAYS IN PREDICTING CHANGES IN THE WEATHER
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE TRADE WINDS DO NOT FLOW APPARENTLY FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH DIRECTLY TOWARD THE EQUATOR BUT IN AN OBLIQUE DIRECTION ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE EQUATOR WE HAVE A NORTHEASTERLY WIND AND A SOUTHEASTERLY WIND ON THE SOUTH SIDE
THEN SHE ASKED THAT THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER AND CONSIDER WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING THIS SEEMED FAIR AND THEY CAME SHE EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO HOLD A CHURCH SERVICE THAT AS THEY WERE LEAVING THEIR OLD HOMES AND SEEKING NEW ONES IN HER COUNTRY
THE USE OF THE TELEGRAPH IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WEATHER BUREAU HAVING STATIONS FOR OBSERVATION AT CONVENIENT POINTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAS CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE SCIENCE OF METEOROLOGY IT IS FOUND THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF HIGH AND LOW PRESSURE EXISTING AT THE SAME TIME
YEARS AGO I ATTENDED AT SOME INCONVENIENCE A LARGE PUBLIC MEETING BECAUSE I HEARD THAT LUCRETIA MOTT WAS TO SPEAK AFTER SEVERAL ADDRESSES A SLIGHT LADY WITH WHITE CAP AND DRAB QUAKER DRESS CAME FORWARD THOUGH WELL IN YEARS
SUCH GRAVE PRECAUTIONS DID NOT ENTIRELY PREVENT THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR WHEN A LAD WAS SHUT UP IN A CLOSET ON BREAD AND WATER LUCRETIA AND HER SISTER SUPPLIED HIM WITH BREAD AND BUTTER UNDER THE DOOR THIS BOY WAS A COUSIN OF THE TEACHER JAMES MOTT
AND WHEN ONCE SATURATED WITH HEAT IS SLOW TO GIVE IT UP
THUS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE BAROMETER WILL REGISTER THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN AIR PRESSURE LET US DWELL FOR A MOMENT ON THE CAUSES OF WHAT ARE COMMONLY CALLED CHANGES OF WEATHER WHEN WE WILL AGAIN REVERT TO THE USE OF THE BAROMETER
JOHN STUART MILL AND DEAN STANLEY THOUGH WIDELY DIFFERENT WERE AMONG HER FAVORITE AUTHORS JAMES MOTT WAS NOW PROSPERING IN THE COTTON BUSINESS SO THAT THEY COULD SPARE TIME TO GO IN THEIR CARRIAGE AND SPEAK AT THE QUAKER MEETINGS IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
ALL OF WHICH HELPS TO COMPLICATE ANY THEORY THAT MAY BE ADVANCED REGARDING CHANGES OF WEATHER ASIDE FROM THE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAT ARE DUE TO THE SEASONS WHICH ARE CAUSED BY THE OSCILLATING MOTION OF THE EARTH BETWEEN THE LIMITS OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER ON THE NORTH
THE SCHOOL WAS OPENED WITH FOUR PUPILS EACH PAYING SEVEN DOLLARS A QUARTER THE YOUNG WIFE PUT SO MUCH GOOD CHEER AND EARNESTNESS INTO HER WORK THAT SOON THERE WERE FORTY PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL MISTER MOTT'S PROSPECTS NOW BRIGHTENED FOR HE WAS EARNING ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
HER EYES WERE BRIGHT HER SMILE WAS WINSOME
AND FILL IT WITH MERCURY AND WHILE THUS FILLED PLUNGE THE OPEN END INTO A VESSEL OF MERCURY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF MERCURY REMAINING IN THE TUBE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MERCURY IN THE VESSEL WILL WEIGH ABOUT FIFTEEN POUNDS
WE MAY NOTICE THAT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING A BREEZE WILL SPRING UP FROM THE OCEAN AND BLOW TOWARD THE LAND THIS WILL INCREASE IN INTENSITY UNTIL ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN IT HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM VELOCITY AND FROM THIS TIME IT GRADUALLY DIMINISHES
THE LOWER CURRENTS BEING CALLED THE LOWER TRADES THESE UPPER TRADES GRADUALLY FALL TILL THEY REACH THE TROPIC OF CANCER ON THE NORTH WHERE THE LOWER PART OF THE CURRENT STOPS AND BENDS BACK TOWARD THE EQUATOR NOW BECOMING A PART OF THE LOWER TRADE WIND
IN THE SOUTHERN LATITUDES THERE IS A COMPARATIVELY CONSTANT CONDITION OF WIND AND WEATHER BECAUSE THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE IN THESE REGIONS IS MOSTLY WATER BUT IN THE NORTH WHERE MOST OF THE LAND SURFACE IS LOCATED
ATTENDED WITH LOCAL STORMS SOMEWHAT AS WE HAVE THEM IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE
WHEN IT BENDS IN ITS COURSE AND MOVES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AROUND THIS CENTER BUT CONSTANTLY MOVING INWARD TOWARD IT IN A SPIRAL FORM AND IN A DIRECTION THAT IS REVERSE TO THAT OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK
WILL FLOW IN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE WARMER AND LIGHTER AIR THAT IS DRIVEN UPWARD REALLY BY THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WHICH CAUSES THE HEAVIER FLUID TO KEEP THE LOWEST LEVEL AS THE EARTH GROWS HOTTER THIS MOVEMENT IS MORE AND MORE RAPID
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE ON THE MERCURY IN THE OPEN VESSEL IS LESS THAN FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AND AGAIN CONDITIONS MAY ARISE THAT WILL CONDENSE THE AIR AND MAKE IT FOR THE TIME BEING WEIGH MORE THAN FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH IN WHICH CASE THE MERCURY WILL RISE IN THE TUBE
AND ITS PLACE IS OCCUPIED BY THE HEAVIER COOLER AIR THAT FLOWS IN FROM THE SIDES WE CAN NOW SEE THAT IF THERE IS A STRONG ASCENDING CURRENT OF AIR ON THE LAND NEAR THE OCEAN THE COOLER AIR FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
THE PROJECTILE WOULD APPEAR TO ANYONE STANDING AT THE EQUATOR TO COME DIRECTLY FROM THE NORTH IF HOWEVER THE EARTH IS REVOLVING AT THE RATE OF ONE THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR AT THE EQUATOR TO THE EASTWARD AND THE PROJECTILE WAS FIRED FROM THE POLE WHERE THERE IS PRACTICALLY NO MOTION
THE YOUNG COUPLE WERE HAPPY IN THEIR HARD WORK FOR THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND LOVE LIGHTENS ALL CARE AND LABOR BUT SOON A SORROW WORSE THAN POVERTY CAME THEIR ONLY SON THOMAS A MOST AFFECTIONATE CHILD
YEARS AFTER LUCRETIA SAID
BUT IF WE HAVE A SERIES OF BAROMETERS LOCATED AT DIFFERENT STATIONS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND CONNECTED AT HEADQUARTERS BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE READINGS FROM A WHOLE SERIES OF BAROMETERS AT ONCE THEN IT BECOMES A VERY USEFUL INSTRUMENT
AND OWING TO THE PECULIAR WAY IT ASCENDS BY CIRCLING SPIRALLY UPWARD AROUND A REGION OF COMPARATIVE CALM IT CREATES A PARTIAL VACUUM WHICH IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE CENTER OF THE AREA
IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WORLD'S CONVENTION WAS CALLED AT LONDON TO DEBATE THE SLAVERY QUESTION AMONG THE DELEGATES CHOSEN WERE JAMES AND LUCRETIA MOTT WENDELL PHILLIPS AND HIS WIFE AND OTHERS
UNTIL IN THE EVENING THERE WILL BE A SEASON OF CALM THE SAME AS THERE WAS IN THE EARLY MORNING THE EXPLANATION OF THIS PECULIAR ACTION OF THE AIR IS FOUND IN THE FACT THAT DURING THE DAY THE LAND IS HEATED MUCH MORE RAPIDLY ON ITS SURFACE THAN THE WATER IS
THAT HE DETERMINED TO OPEN A SMALL STORE BUT THE EXPERIMENT PROVED A FAILURE HIS HEALTH BEGAN TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS ILL SUCCESS WHEN LUCRETIA WITH HER BRAVE HEART SAID MY COUSIN AND I WILL OPEN A SCHOOL THEE MUST NOT GET DISCOURAGED JAMES
AND MISSUS MOTT WAS ADDRESSING THEM ALL DAY LONG THEY CURSED AND THREW STONES AND AS SOON AS THE WOMEN LEFT THE BUILDING THEY BURNED IT TO ASHES THEN WROUGHT UP TO FURY THE MOB STARTED FOR THE HOUSE OF JAMES AND LUCRETIA MOTT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE COMING
THE AREAS OF LOW PRESSURE ARE CALLED CYCLONES WHILE THE AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE ARE CALLED ANTI CYCLONES BY CYCLONE WE DO NOT MEAN THOSE CLOUD FUNNELS COMMONLY CALLED BY THAT NAME THAT FORM AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND PRODUCE SUCH DESTRUCTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY
AS IT TRAVELS NORTH AND SOUTH IT GRADUALLY DROPS AS IT BECOMES COOLER AND FINALLY AT SOME POINT NORTH AND SOUTH ITS COURSE IS CHANGED AND IT FLOWS IN AGAIN TOWARD THE EQUATOR
THEY COULD TALK A LITTLE ON CERTAIN DAYS OVER A CERTAIN CORNER OF THE FENCE BETWEEN THE PLAYGROUNDS
OUTSIDE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER IS USUALLY NOT AT A VERY HIGH SPEED BUT IN NORTHERN LATITUDES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HANDS OF A CLOCK AS IT CIRCLES AROUND IT WIDENS OUT SPIRALLY UNTIL IT REACHES THE EDGE OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
SELWYN KEPT ROCKLAND AT HOME AND ARRANGED TO HAVE HIM MEET BY SPECIAL APPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT CITIZENS OF THE TWELVE UNCERTAIN STATES HE WOULD HAVE THE MOST PROMINENT PARTY LEADER IN A PARTICULAR STATE
AND THE LANGUID TONE OF HER VOICE CHANGED TO ONE A LITTLE MORE LIKE SINCERITY BUT SUPPOSE THERE IS NO WAR SHE DEMANDED SUPPOSE YOU GO ON LIVING AT BARRACKS HERE AND THERE AND WITH NO BROADER OUTLOOK THAN SUCH A LIFE ENTAILS
SANE AND CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WHEN MUNTING LEAVES HE IS STEPPING ON AIR HE SEES VISIONS OF VISITS TO WASHINGTON TO CONSULT THE PRESIDENT UPON MATTERS OF STATE AND PERHAPS HE SEES AN AMBASSADORSHIP IN THE MISTY FUTURE
TO SUPPLY SPONTANEOUSLY THE TRUTH WHICH DEMOCRATS HOPED WAS INBORN AND WHEN WE EXPECT IT TO SUPPLY SUCH A BODY OF TRUTH WE EMPLOY A MISLEADING STANDARD OF JUDGMENT WE MISUNDERSTAND THE LIMITED NATURE OF NEWS
SUDDENLY TURNING FROM THE COMMONPLACES OF THE DAY GLORIA LOOKED DIRECTLY AT PHILIP AND WITH EASY SELF POSSESSION TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF I AM WONDERING MISTER DRU
THEY WANTED THE CANDIDATE TO REMEMBER THE ENTHUSIASM OF THESE PLACES AND TO LEAVE GREATLY PLEASED AND UNDER THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS MAKING UNTOLD CONVERTS AS A MATTER OF FACT HIS VOICE WOULD SELDOM REACH ANY BUT A STAUNCH PARTISAN
GO TO A RICH BREWER OR LARGE MANUFACTURER WHOSE VIEWS HAD NOT YET BEEN CRYSTALLIZED AND SAY GOVERNOR ROCKLAND HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO KNOW YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO ARRANGE A MEETING
THERE WAS AMONG THE YOUNG GRADUATING SOLDIERS ONE WHO SEEMED DEPRESSED AND OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE TRIUMPHANT BLARE OF MILITARISM FOR HE ALONE OF HIS FELLOW CLASSMEN HAD THERE NO KITH NOR KIN TO BID HIM GOD SPEED IN HIS NEW CAREER
CHAPTER ONE GRADUATION DAY IN THE YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THE STUDENT AND THE STATESMAN SAW MANY INDICATIONS THAT THE SOCIAL FINANCIAL
IT WAS DONE SO SANELY AND SO QUIETLY THAT NO ONE SUSPECTED THE MASTER MIND BEHIND IT ALL SELWYN WAS RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE TOOK NO ONE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE AND WAS THEREFORE IN NO DANGER OF BETRAYAL
WERE NOW THROTTLING INDIVIDUAL EFFORT AND SHACKLING THE GREAT MOVEMENT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY DRU'S VOICE BECAME TENSE AND VIBRANT AND HE TALKED IN QUICK SHARP JERKS
THE NEWS IS UNCOVERED FOR THE PRESS BY A SYSTEM OF INTELLIGENCE THAT IS ALSO A CHECK UPON THE PRESS THAT IS THE RADICAL WAY FOR THE TROUBLES OF THE PRESS LIKE THE TROUBLES OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BE IT TERRITORIAL OR FUNCTIONAL
MUCH WILL DEPEND UPON THE HYPOTHESIS WE HOLD IF WE ASSUME WITH MISTER SINCLAIR AND MOST OF HIS OPPONENTS THAT NEWS AND TRUTH ARE TWO WORDS FOR THE SAME THING WE SHALL I BELIEVE ARRIVE NOWHERE WE SHALL PROVE THAT ON THIS POINT THE NEWSPAPER LIED
THE OPPOSITION WAS SENDING SPEAKERS AT GREAT EXPENSE FROM ONE END OF THE COUNTRY TO THE OTHER AND THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES RARELY FELL ON ANY BUT FRIENDLY AND SYMPATHETIC EARS
THE FUNCTION OF TRUTH IS TO BRING TO LIGHT THE HIDDEN FACTS TO SET THEM INTO RELATION WITH EACH OTHER AND MAKE A PICTURE OF REALITY ON WHICH MEN CAN ACT
AND PETTY CONQUESTS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF WEALTH WERE AT STAKE HE SAW THE GREAT CITY WHERE LUXURY DOMINANT AND DEFIANT EXISTED LARGELY BY GRACE OF EXPLOITATION EXPLOITATION OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THE SELECTION OF CABINET OFFICERS AND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WAS LAUNCHED DRUNK WITH POWER AND THE ADULATION OF SYCOPHANTS ONCE OR TWICE ROCKLAND ASSERTED HIMSELF AND ACTED UPON IMPORTANT MATTERS WITHOUT HAVING FIRST CONFERRED WITH SELWYN
IT CAN NORMALLY RECORD ONLY WHAT HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR IT BY THE WORKING OF INSTITUTIONS EVERYTHING ELSE IS ARGUMENT AND OPINION AND FLUCTUATES WITH THE VICISSITUDES THE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE COURAGE OF THE HUMAN MIND
RELATIVES AND ADMIRERS OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BEING SENT OUT TO THE ULTIMATE LEADERSHIP OF THE NATION'S ARMY THE SCENE HAD ALL THE USUAL CHARM OF WEST POINT GRADUATIONS AND THE USUAL INTOXICATING ATMOSPHERE OF MILITARY DISPLAY
SAW A GLOOMY AND HOPELESS FUTURE WITH THESE CONDITIONS PREVAILING THE GRADUATION EXERCISES OF THE CLASS OF NINETEEN TWENTY OF THE NATIONAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT HELD FOR MANY A FOREBODING PROMISE OF MOMENTOUS CHANGES
WE SHALL PROVE THAT ON THAT POINT MISTER SINCLAIR'S ACCOUNT LIED WE SHALL DEMONSTRATE THAT MISTER SINCLAIR LIED WHEN HE SAID THAT SOMEBODY LIED AND THAT SOMEBODY LIED WHEN HE SAID MISTER SINCLAIR LIED WE SHALL VENT OUR FEELINGS BUT WE SHALL VENT THEM INTO AIR
OFTENTIMES OUR INCLINATIONS LEAD US IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS AND IT IS ONLY AFTERWARDS THAT IT SEEMS AS IF FATE MAY FROM THE FIRST HAVE SO DETERMINED IT THE MISCHIEVOUS TWINKLE LEFT THE GIRL'S EYES
IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO FUNCTION THE UNSCRUPULOUS JOURNALIST CAN FISH IN TROUBLED WATERS AND THE CONSCIENTIOUS ONE MUST GAMBLE WITH UNCERTAINTIES THE PRESS IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INSTITUTIONS IT IS LIKE THE BEAM OF A SEARCHLIGHT THAT MOVES RESTLESSLY ABOUT
HE DIVIDED EACH OF THESE STATES INTO UNITS CONTAINING FIVE THOUSAND VOTERS AND AT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS HE PLACED ONE MAN IN CHARGE OF EACH UNIT
THE MAN APPROACHED WOULD BE FLATTERED TO THINK HE WAS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO MEET HIM HE WOULD KNOW IT WAS HIS INFLUENCE THAT WAS WANTED BUT EVEN SO THERE WAS A SUBTLE FLATTERY IN THAT
TO MAKE THE CHARGES OF PERVERSION OR SUPPRESSION MORE THAN A PARTISAN JUDGMENT THERE IS NO DEFENSE NO EXTENUATION NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR STATING SIX TIMES THAT LENIN IS DEAD WHEN THE ONLY INFORMATION THE PAPER POSSESSES
WHEN HE REACHED ROCKLAND'S HOME HE WOULD AT FIRST BE DENIED ADMITTANCE HIS SPONSOR WOULD SAY THIS IS MISTER MUNTING OF MUNTINGVILLE OH PARDON ME MISTER MUNTING GOVERNOR ROCKLAND EXPECTS YOU
IF THE PRESS IS NOT SO UNIVERSALLY WICKED NOR SO DEEPLY CONSPIRING AS MISTER SINCLAIR WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE IT IS VERY MUCH MORE FRAIL THAN THE DEMOCRATIC THEORY HAS AS YET ADMITTED IT IS TOO FRAIL TO CARRY THE WHOLE BURDEN OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
HAVE BECOME A BUNDLE OF PROBLEMS WHICH THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE READING THE PRESS AS A WHOLE IS SUPPOSED TO SOLVE THE PRESS IN OTHER WORDS HAS COME TO BE REGARDED AS AN ORGAN OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY CHARGED ON A MUCH WIDER SCALE AND FROM DAY TO DAY
AND AMONG THE GREAT MASSES OF THE PEOPLE THERE WAS SULLEN AND REBELLIOUS DISCONTENT THE LABORER IN THE CITIES THE PRODUCER ON THE FARM THE MERCHANT THE PROFESSIONAL MAN AND ALL SAVE ORGANIZED CAPITAL AND ITS SATELLITES
HONEST OFFICIALS WHO WERE IN THE WAY WERE REMOVED BY OFFERING THEM PLACES VASTLY MORE REMUNERATIVE AND IN THIS MANNER HE BUILT UP A STRONG INTELLIGENT AND WELL CONSTRUCTED MACHINE
SO HE WAS LED BY WEAK AND SELFISH MEN WHO COULD ONLY INCITE HIM TO FURTHER WANTON MURDER AND DEMOLITION BUT OUT OF THAT REVELRY OF BLOOD THERE DAWNED UPON MANKIND THE HOPE OF A MORE SPLENDID DAY THE DIVINITY OF KINGS
THE OPPOSITION HAD ITS CANDIDATES GOING BY SPECIAL TRAIN TO EVERY PART OF THE UNION MAKING MANY SPEECHES EVERY DAY AND MOSTLY TO VOTERS THAT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN FROM HIM EITHER BY FORCE OR PERSUASION THE LEADERS IN CITIES
THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH SEEMS TO ME THE MOST FERTILE IS THAT NEWS AND TRUTH ARE NOT THE SAME THING AND MUST BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FOOTNOTE WHEN I WROTE LIBERTY AND THE NEWS I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS DISTINCTION CLEARLY ENOUGH TO STATE IT
AND HE STRUGGLED FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE FOR THE MINIMUM OF FOOD AND CLOTHING NECESSARY TO KEEP BREATH WITHIN THE BODY HIS LABOR AND HIS VERY LIFE ITSELF WAS SUBJECT TO THE GREED THE PASSION AND THE CAPRICE OF HIS OVER LORD
ON WHICH THEIR OPINIONS ARE FOUNDED AND BY CRITICISM AND AGITATION TO PROD SOCIAL SCIENCE INTO MAKING MORE USABLE FORMULATIONS OF SOCIAL FACTS AND TO PROD STATESMEN INTO ESTABLISHING MORE VISIBLE INSTITUTIONS THE PRESS IN OTHER WORDS
BUT HE TOLD THE PARTY LEADERS THERE TO CLAIM THAT A REVOLUTION WAS BREWING AND THAT A LANDSLIDE WOULD FOLLOW AT THE ELECTION THIS WOULD KEEP HIS ANTAGONISTS BUSY AND MAKE THEM LESS EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE
BY COMPARABLE RECORD AND ANALYSIS IF AT THE CENTERS OF MANAGEMENT THERE IS A RUNNING AUDIT WHICH MAKES WORK INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE WHO DO IT AND THOSE WHO SUPERINTEND IT ISSUES WHEN THEY ARISE ARE NOT THE MERE COLLISIONS OF THE BLIND THEN TOO
ONE OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES DIED TWO RETIRED BECAUSE OF AGE AND ALL WERE REPLACED BY MEN SUGGESTED BY SELWYN HE NOW HAD THE SENATE THE EXECUTIVE AND A MAJORITY OF THE COURT OF LAST RESORT
LIKE THE TROUBLES OF INDUSTRY BE IT CAPITALIST COOPERATIVE OR COMMUNIST GO BACK TO A COMMON SOURCE TO THE FAILURE OF SELF GOVERNING PEOPLE TO TRANSCEND THEIR CASUAL EXPERIENCE AND THEIR PREJUDICE BY INVENTING CREATING AND ORGANIZING A MACHINERY OF KNOWLEDGE
BUT HELSINGFORS SAYS LENIN IS DEAD AND A NEWSPAPER CAN BE ASKED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT MAKING LENIN MORE DEAD THAN THE SOURCE OF THE NEWS IS RELIABLE IF THERE IS ONE SUBJECT ON WHICH EDITORS ARE MOST RESPONSIBLE
BUT AFTER HE HAD BEEN BITTERLY ASSAILED BY SELWYN'S PAPERS AND BY HIS SENATORS HE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPTS AT INDEPENDENCE HE FELT THAT HE WAS UTTERLY HELPLESS IN THAT STRONG MAN'S HANDS AND SO INDEED HE WAS
AND YET THERE IS WITHIN ME THE LUST FOR ACTION AND BATTLE IT IS THE PRIMITIVE MAN IN ME I SUPPOSE BUT SOBERED AND ENLIGHTENED BY CIVILIZATION I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO AVERT WAR AND THE SUFFERING IT ENTAILS FATE
AS THE QUALITY OF NEWS IN RADICAL PAPERS SHOWS BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE PRESS DEALS WITH A SOCIETY IN WHICH THE GOVERNING FORCES ARE SO IMPERFECTLY RECORDED THE THEORY THAT THE PRESS CAN ITSELF RECORD THOSE FORCES IS FALSE
BOTH LARGE AND SMALL WOULD SECURE A DATE AND HAVING IN MIND FOR THEMSELVES A POSTMASTERSHIP OR COLLECTORSHIP WOULD TELL THEIR FOLLOWERS TO TURN OUT IN GREAT FORCE AND GIVE THE CANDIDATE A BIG OVATION
IT IS NOT EVEN THINKABLE FOR THE NEWS AS WE HAVE SEEN IS PRECISE IN PROPORTION TO THE PRECISION WITH WHICH THE EVENT IS RECORDED UNLESS THE EVENT IS CAPABLE OF BEING NAMED MEASURED GIVEN SHAPE MADE SPECIFIC
THAT THE PRESS WHEN IT IS TURNED UPON THEM REVEALS A SITUATION INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH FOR A POPULAR DECISION THE TROUBLE LIES DEEPER THAN THE PRESS AND SO DOES THE REMEDY IT LIES IN SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON A SYSTEM OF ANALYSIS AND RECORD
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPELLED TO ACT WITHOUT A RELIABLE PICTURE OF THE WORLD THAT GOVERNMENTS SCHOOLS NEWSPAPERS AND CHURCHES MAKE SUCH SMALL HEADWAY AGAINST THE MORE OBVIOUS FAILINGS OF DEMOCRACY AGAINST VIOLENT PREJUDICE APATHY
WILL YOU BE SATISFIED IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE IN MIND TO DO IN THE WORLD HE LOOKED AT HER MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER SUCH AN OBSERVATION OF LIFE HIS LIFE SEEMED BEYOND HER YEARS FOR HE KNEW BUT LITTLE OF THE WOMEN OF HIS OWN GENERATION
WHICH HE ORGANIZED HIMSELF THOUGH LARGELY UNDER COVER THE OPPOSITION PARTY HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL AND IT WAS A GREAT INTELLECTUAL TREAT TO SELWYN TO OVERCOME THEIR NATURAL ADVANTAGES BY THE SHEER FORCE OF ABILITY
AND INDUSTRIAL TROUBLES THAT HAD VEXED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR SO LONG A TIME WERE ABOUT TO CULMINATE IN CIVIL WAR WEALTH HAD GROWN SO STRONG THAT THE FEW WERE ABOUT TO STRANGLE THE MANY
HE WAS ALMOST WHOLLY IGNORANT FOR IN THE SCHEME OF SOCIETY AS THEN CONSTRUCTED THE RULING FEW FELT THAT HE MUST BE KEPT IGNORANT OTHERWISE THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO HOLD HIM IN BONDAGE FOR HIM THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY WAS CLOSED
TO THE DAILY PRESS AND TO PROFESSIONAL STUMP SPEAKERS HE GAVE SCANT COMFORT IT WAS NOT TO SUCH SOURCES THAT HE LOOKED FOR SUCCESS HE BEGAN BY ELIMINATING ALL STATES HE KNEW THE OPPOSITION PARTY WOULD CERTAINLY CARRY
THAT WILL TAKE UP THE SLACK IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THE PRESS HAS OFTEN MISTAKENLY PRETENDED THAT IT COULD DO JUST THAT IT HAS AT GREAT MORAL COST TO ITSELF ENCOURAGED A DEMOCRACY STILL BOUND TO ITS ORIGINAL PREMISES
AT FIRST THIS CAVE LOOKED PITCH BLACK TO ME INSIDE THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMED TO DIMINISH BY DEGREES THEIR HAZY TRANSPARENCY WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DROWNED LIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO WENT IN WE FOLLOWED HIM
THIS MAGNIFICENT BENEFACTION FROM THE MAN OF THE WATERS TO THE POOR INDIAN FROM CEYLON WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LATTER WITH TREMBLING HANDS HIS BEWILDERED EYES INDICATED
THANK YOU MISTER LAND HE TOLD HIM TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NED LAND REPLIED I OWED IT TO YOU THE GHOST OF A SMILE GLIDED ACROSS THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS AND THAT WAS ALL
SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
HAS ITS LINGUISTIC ROOTS IN THE WORD REQUIEM THE NEXT DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AND WERE TEN OR MORE YEARS OLD
ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
IN THE MIDST OF THIS MOVING VEGETATION UNDER ARBORS OF WATER PLANTS THERE RACED LEGIONS OF CLUMSY ARTICULATES IN PARTICULAR SOME FANGED FROG CRABS
FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
WHOSE AFTERSHOCKS KNOCKED CONSEIL OFF HIS FEET MEANWHILE NED LAND PULLED THE CAPTAIN CLEAR UNINJURED THE LATTER STOOD UP WENT RIGHT TO THE INDIAN QUICKLY CUT THE ROPE BINDING THE MAN TO HIS STONE
WERE GENUINELY INEXHAUSTIBLE SINCE NATURE'S CREATIVE POWERS ARE GREATER THAN MAN'S DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS TRUE TO THOSE INSTINCTS NED LAND GREEDILY STUFFED THE FINEST OF THESE MOLLUSKS
NOTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN
I DISTINGUISHED THE UNPREDICTABLY CONTOURED SPRINGINGS OF A VAULT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PILLARS FIRMLY BASED ON A GRANITE FOUNDATION LIKE THE WEIGHTY COLUMNS OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE WHY HAD OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE GUIDE
NONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE TO GO WITH US ON THIS NEW EXCURSION
WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE
I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT
WHEN I SHARED THESE IMPRESSIONS WITH HIM HE ANSWERED ME IN A TONE TOUCHED WITH EMOTION THAT INDIAN PROFESSOR LIVES IN THE LAND OF THE OPPRESSED AND I AM TO THIS DAY AND WILL BE UNTIL MY LAST
SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH
CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS
WHO JUMPED ASIDE AND AVOIDED THE SHARK'S BITE BUT NOT THE THRASHING OF ITS TAIL BECAUSE THAT TAIL STRUCK HIM ACROSS THE CHEST AND STRETCHED HIM OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR THIS SCENE LASTED BARELY A FEW SECONDS THE SHARK RETURNED ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK
THAT WOMB FOR PEARLS WHOSE VALVES ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN SIZE HAS THE SHAPE OF A ROUND SHELL WITH THICK WALLS
THE SUN'S RAYS PIERCED THE CLOUD CURTAIN GATHERED ON THE EASTERLY HORIZON AND THE RADIANT ORB ROSE SWIFTLY I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE SHORE WHICH FEATURED A FEW SPARSE TREES HERE AND THERE
I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION
COMING FROM WELL OUT A MILD SWELL MADE THE SKIFF ROLL GENTLY AND A FEW CRESTING BILLOWS LAPPED AT ITS BOW WE WERE SILENT WHAT WAS CAPTAIN NEMO THINKING
THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
A GENUINE EIGHT DECIMETER SERPENT WITH A BLUISH GRAY BELLY WHICH WITHOUT THE GOLD LINES OVER ITS FLANKS COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CONGER EEL FROM THE BUTTERFISH GENUS WHOSE OVAL BODIES ARE VERY FLAT
I GOT UP QUICKLY DRESSED AND WENT INTO THE LOUNGE CAPTAIN NEMO WAS WAITING FOR ME PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME ARE YOU READY TO START I'M READY KINDLY FOLLOW ME
WE WALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTIL WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANCHOR CONNECTING THE SEAFLOOR WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF BACK ON BOARD THE SAILORS HELPED DIVEST US OF OUR HEAVY COPPER CARAPACES CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CANADIAN
HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
DEFINED THE UPPER LINES OF THE COAST WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS FAIRLY FLAT TO THE EAST IT SWELLED A LITTLE TOWARD THE SOUTH
I HAVEN'T LET THE NAUTILUS PULL TOO NEAR THE COAST AND WE'RE FAIRLY WELL OUT
THEIR BRIGHTNESS MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY ATTRACT CERTAIN DANGEROUS OCCUPANTS OF THESE WATERWAYS AS CAPTAIN NEMO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I TURNED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND
HE ALLOWED IT TO GROW IMPERCEPTIBLY WITH EACH PASSING YEAR THE MOLLUSK'S SECRETIONS ADDED NEW CONCENTRIC LAYERS THE CAPTAIN ALONE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE WHERE THIS WONDERFUL FRUIT OF NATURE WAS RIPENING
WITH SUCH WONDERFUL DYE SPIKY PERIWINKLES FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS LONG THAT ROSE UNDER THE WAVES LIKE HANDS READY TO GRAB YOU TURBAN SNAILS WITH SHELLS MADE OF HORN
BELLOWED SO TO SPEAK BLOOD WAS POURING INTO THE WAVES FROM ITS WOUNDS
A MONTH TOO SOON AT SIX O'CLOCK THE DAY BROKE SUDDENLY WITH THAT SPEED UNIQUE TO TROPICAL REGIONS
A DIRECT HIT TO THE HEART IN ITS STRUGGLES THE MAN EATER CHURNED THE WATERY MASS SO FURIOUSLY ITS EDDIES THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OVER I WANTED TO RUN TO THE CAPTAIN'S RESCUE BUT I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE
I WOULD SOON FIND OUT AFTER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP SLOPE OUR FEET TROD THE FLOOR OF A SORT OF CIRCULAR PIT
IT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET LONG ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH OCCUPIED A THIRD OF ITS BODY IT WAS AN ADULT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SIX ROWS OF TEETH FORMING AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IN ITS UPPER JAW
NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE FINALLY SURVEYED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH WHERE PEARL OYSTERS REPRODUCE BY THE MILLIONS
WHAT ABOUT OUR WEAPONS I ASKED HIM OUR RIFLES RIFLES WHAT FOR DON'T YOUR MOUNTAINEERS ATTACK BEARS DAGGER IN HAND AND ISN'T STEEL SURER THAN LEAD HERE'S A STURDY BLADE SLIP IT UNDER YOUR BELT AND LET'S BE OFF
THEN FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I LET MYSELF BE CROWNED WITH MY HEAVY COPPER SPHERE AND OUR AIR TANKS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION AN INSTANT LATER THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS HELPED US OVERBOARD ONE AFTER THE OTHER
NOT YET DISTURBED BY DIVERS AT WORK WE WALKED BY OURSELVES GENUINE LOITERERS STOPPING OR STRAYING AS OUR FANCIES DICTATED FOR MY PART I WAS NO LONGER WORRIED ABOUT THOSE DANGERS MY IMAGINATION HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED
ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS
YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY THIS
THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE THERE
COVERING THREE QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST GOING UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST DURING THE NIGHT THE NAUTILUS LAY WEST OF THE BAY
AROUND OUR LONGBOAT BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US THEY POUNCED ON THE CORPSE AND QUARRELED OVER EVERY SCRAP OF IT BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE BACK ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS THERE I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT MARKED OUR EXCURSION
IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
AND WE'LL BEGIN OUR STROLL I DIDN'T REPLY AND WHILE STARING AT THESE SUSPICIOUS WAVES I BEGAN TO PUT ON MY HEAVY AQUATIC CLOTHES HELPED BY THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS
WHO WAS STATIONED BESIDE ME SUDDENLY STOOD UP THEN HE STRODE RIGHT TOWARD THE MONSTER DAGGER IN HAND READY TO FIGHT IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO SNAP UP THE POOR FISHERMAN THE MAN EATER SAW ITS NEW ADVERSARY
CONTRARY TO THE CANADIAN'S VIEWS IN WHICH IT STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY AS FOR CONSEIL HE HAD COME ALONG OUT OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY
I UNDERSTOOD HIS FEAR A GIGANTIC SHADOW APPEARED ABOVE THE POOR DIVER IT WAS A SHARK OF HUGE SIZE MOVING IN DIAGONALLY EYES ABLAZE JAWS WIDE OPEN I WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HORROR
INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE BUT WE COULDN'T STOP WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN
FIVE METERS AWAY A SHADOW APPEARED AND DROPPED TO THE SEAFLOOR THE ALARMING IDEA OF SHARKS CROSSED MY MIND BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
EDIBLE FISH THAT WHEN DRIED AND MARINATED MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH KNOWN BY THE NAME
I SAW THE DARING CAPTAIN CLINGING TO ONE OF THE ANIMAL'S FINS FIGHTING THE MONSTER AT CLOSE QUARTERS BELABORING HIS
AND HOW WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EVIL WAS PRESENT WITH HIM INDEED HE KNEW NOT HOW IT WAS HIS MOTHER BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THE CITY WAS NO PLACE FOR HIM URGED HIS GOING TO SEA AND WOULD HAVE SHIPPED HIM ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR
I HAVE GOT A BIT OF A SCRATCH ON THE BACK BUT IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS I WILL GET OFF IN A MOMENT MARY THE HORSE HAS AN ASSEGAI IN HIS QUARTERS AND I MUST GET IT OUT TAKE ME DOWN TOO PLEASE I FEEL GIDDY NOW IT IS ALL OVER
THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T SAID RONALD EARNESTLY THOUGH I COULD NOT HAVE BLAMED YOU THEY PAUSED AT THE ENTRANCE TO EACH KLOOF THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD TO PASS AND THE FINGOES WENT CAUTIOUSLY AHEAD SEARCHING THROUGH THE BUSHES
I FLATTER MYSELF THAT MY GET UP IS VERY GOOD RONALD LAUGHED
NOLAN SAID HE HAD BEEN BADLY WOUNDED BUT THE SURGEON TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT GET ROUND
BUT THERE WAS STILL LIGHT ENOUGH FOR HIM LOOKING INTENTLY TO SEE A FIGURE MOVING ALONG ONCE OR TWICE HE FANCIED HE SAW A DARK SHADOW ON THE GROUND CLOSE TO THE HUT BUT HE WAS NOT SURE AND WAS STILL GAZING INTENTLY WHEN THERE WAS A TOUCH ON HIS SHOULDER AND LOOKING ROUND
IT SEEMS VERY UNKIND TO LEAVE HIM THE GIRL SAID AFTER ALL HE HAS DONE FOR ME HE WILL UNDERSTAND IT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY AND YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE HOSPITAL DIRECTLY YOU GET THERE MARY RELUCTANTLY ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE LIFTED INTO THE SADDLE AND RODE OFF WITH THE TROOPER
HOW LITTLE DID I KNOW MYSELF OF THE BEST WAY TO INSTRUCT AND COUNSEL THEM YET I
THEY ALSO PROCURED HIM AN EXCELLENT PLACE AS A COACHMAN BUT WANTING MONEY HE SOLD HIS LIVERY AND OTHER THINGS BELONGING TO HIS MASTER
FOR THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD HAVE PENETRATED INTO THE HEART OF THE AMATOLAS DID NOT STRIKE THEM AS POSSIBLE THE ARGUMENT WAS ONLY AS TO WHICH OF THE OTHER CHIEFS WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO ROB MACOMO
YOUR FATHER MISS ARMSTRONG I HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HIM SINCE I HEARD FROM SERGEANT BLUNT THAT YOU HAD ALL GOT SAFELY AWAY AFTER THAT ATTACK HE WAS IN THE WAGGON SIR RONALD EXPLAINED HE WAS HURT IN THE FIGHT WITH THE KAFFIRS AND MISTER NOLAN BROUGHT HIM BACK IN THE WAGGONS
I THINK I CAN SIT A HORSE NOW RONALD SAID TRYING TO RISE
AND ONE OF THE FINGOES WENT ON AHEAD TO SEE IF THE FIRES WERE OUT AND ALL NATIVES INSIDE THEIR HUTS SEVERAL TIMES ALTHOUGH ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS WERE ASLEEP THE SCOUT RETURNED SAYING THAT THEY COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE KRAAL FOR THE DOGS HAD SCENTED HIM AND GROWLED FIERCELY
ONCE OUT OF THE BUSH THE PARTY HURRIED DOWN THE GRASSY SLOPE AND THEN KEPT ON A MILE FURTHER THE CHIEF NOW GAVE A LOUD CALL IT WAS ANSWERED FAINTLY FROM THE DISTANCE IN FIVE MINUTES THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S HOOFS WERE HEARD AND IN A SHORT TIME
KRETA LISTENED TO THE REPORTS OF EACH OF HIS MEN AND THEY HELD A SHORT CONSULTATION THEN HE CAME UP TO RONALD ONE OF MY MEN HAS FOUND A PLACE THAT WILL DO WELL HE SAID IT IS TIME WE WERE GOING ONE OF THE FINGOES NOW TOOK THE LEAD THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
STILL HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE HIS PRIVILEGES AND TO INVOLVE HIMSELF IN REPEATED DIFFICULTIES FROM WHICH HIS MOTHER AS OFTEN EXTRICATED HIM AT EACH TIME SHE TALKED MUCH AND REASONED AND REMONSTRATED WITH HIM
THE READER WILL PARDON THIS PASSING HOMILY WHILE WE RETURN TO OUR NARRATIVE WE WERE SAYING THAT THE DAY DREAMS OF ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
YOU TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND PADDLE YOUR FEET IN THE WATER THAT WOULD BE REFRESHING THE GIRL SAID MY FEET ARE ACHING DREADFULLY NOW PLEASE TELL ME ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED AND HOW YOU CAME TO BE HERE
ME DON'T LIKE IT INCOS ME TELL YOU WHAT WE DO WE KEEP OVER TO LEFT AND THEN WHEN WE GET JUST THROUGH THE BUSH WE FIRE OUR GUNS THEN THE KAFFIRS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND ALL RUN THAT WAY AND YOU RIDE STRAIGHT THROUGH
SOME BRANDY AND WATER WAS POURED BETWEEN RONALD'S LIPS AND HE SOON OPENED HIS EYES DON'T MOVE SERGEANT OR YOU WILL SET YOUR WOUND OFF BLEEDING AGAIN WE WILL SOON GET YOU COMFORTABLY INTO HOSPITAL
TILL HIS MOTHER RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER DATED OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH
A COMMON MODE AMONG THE KAFFIRS OF PUTTING ANY ONE TO DEATH THE WHOLE THING DID NOT OCCUPY A MOMENT AND AS THE WOMEN DISAPPEARED FROM HER SIGHT TWO NATIVES ROSE TO THEIR FEET AND LOOKED ROUND
HE FELT HIS HORSE GIVE A SUDDEN SPRING AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIT WITH AN ASSEGAI WHILE ALMOST AT THE SAME INSTANT HE FELT A SENSATION AS OF A HOT IRON RUNNING FROM HIS BELT TO HIS SHOULDER AS A SPEAR RIPPED UP CLOTH AND FLESH AND THEN GLANCED ALONG OVER HIM
EACH DAY BEFORE STARTING WE HAVE GONE TO OUR FIRES AND GOT FRESH CHARCOAL AND MIXED IT WITH SOME GREASE WE BROUGHT WITH US AND RUBBED IT IN AFRESH YOUR HAIR IS YOUR WEAK POINT RONALD BUT OF COURSE NO EUROPEAN COULD MAKE HIS HAIR LIKE A NATIVE'S
I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THAT MISS ARMSTRONG YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A TERRIBLE TIME AND I HEARTILY CONGRATULATE SERGEANT BLUNT ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS GALLANT ATTEMPT TO RESCUE YOU HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MY FATHER HOW IS HE
SO NOW I AM GOING TO PUT AN END TO MY WRITING AT PRESENT NOTICE WHEN THIS YOU SEE REMEMBER ME AND PLACE ME IN YOUR MIND GET ME TO MY HOME THAT'S IN THE FAR DISTANT WEST TO THE SCENES OF MY CHILDHOOD THAT I LIKE THE BEST
THAT IS ALL RIGHT THEN I WILL GIVE YOU ONE OF MY PISTOLS THEN I CAN HOLD YOU WITH MY RIGHT ARM FOR THE HORSE MAY PLUNGE IF A SPEAR STRIKES HIM I WILL USE MY PISTOL IN MY LEFT HAND I WILL SEE THAT NO ONE CATCHES THE BRIDLE ON THAT SIDE DO YOU ATTEND TO THE RIGHT
AND HE WOULD WITH SUCH PERFECT FRANKNESS LAY OPEN HIS WHOLE SOUL TO HER TELLING HER HE HAD NEVER INTENDED DOING HARM HOW HE HAD BEEN LED ALONG LITTLE BY LITTLE TILL BEFORE HE WAS AWARE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN TROUBLE HOW HE HAD TRIED TO BE GOOD
PERHAPS SIR RONALD SAID FAINTLY YOU WILL LET ONE OF THE TROOP RIDE ON WITH MISS ARMSTRONG AT ONCE I THINK I MUST WAIT FOR A BIT WHY WHAT IS IT SERGEANT THE LIEUTENANT ASKED CATCHING HIM BY THE ARM FOR HE SAW THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING
MACOMO HAD OF COURSE BEEN DRUNK AND SANDILLI MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE THE PRIZE CARRIED OFF FOR HIMSELF MARY ARMSTRONG SHUDDERED AS SHE LISTENED TO THE TALK BUT WHEN THEY HAD GONE ON KRETA SAID GOOD THING THE KAFFIRS HAVE THAT THOUGHT
HE SAW THE CHIEF BESIDE HIM TWO WOMEN WATCH HE SAID OTHERS ALL QUIET GIVE A LITTLE TIME LONGER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL ARE ASLEEP THEN WE GO ON IT SEEMED TO RONALD FULLY TWO HOURS ALTHOUGH IT WAS LESS THAN ONE BEFORE KRETA AGAIN TOUCHED HIM
TWO YEARS PASSED BEFORE ISABELLA KNEW WHAT CHARACTER PETER WAS ESTABLISHING FOR HIMSELF AMONG HIS LOW AND WORTHLESS COMRADES PASSING UNDER THE ASSUMED NAME OF PETER WILLIAMS AND SHE BEGAN TO FEEL A PARENT'S PRIDE IN THE PROMISING APPEARANCE OF HER ONLY SON
IF WE GET OUT OF THIS I SHALL BE SERGEANT BLUNT AGAIN BUT I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO CALL ME RONALD NOW
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HEARD THEIR CALL ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT RONALD GALLOPED AFTER THEM I BEGIN TO HOPE THAT WE SHALL GET THROUGH NOW RONALD SAID AFTER EMERGING FROM ONE OF THESE KLOOFS WE HAVE ONLY ONE MORE BAD PLACE TO PASS BUT OF COURSE THE DANGER IS GREATEST THERE
I HOPE IT WON'T COME TO THAT STILL THERE'S NEVER ANY SAYING AND WE SHALL HAVE ONE OR TWO NASTY PLACES TO PASS THROUGH ON OUR WAY DOWN WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT SHOULD THERE BE ANY KAFFIRS THERE THEY WILL NOT BE KEEPING A WATCH THIS WAY
EACH TIME THAT THIS HAD TO BE DONE KRETA LIFTED MARY ARMSTRONG AND CARRIED HER AND SHE HAD NOW BECOME SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE WAS UNABLE EVEN TO PROTEST RONALD WOULD HAVE CARRIED HER HIMSELF BUT HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE WORSE THAN USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO
I AM GOT ON BOARD THE SAME UNLUCKY SHIP DONE OF NANTUCKET
THEY STARTED THEREFORE REFRESHED AND STRONG IT TOOK THEM MANY HOURS OF PATIENT WORK BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST ON THE LAST SWELL OF THE AMATOLAS THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE MANY DETOURS TO AVOID KRAALS
IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO RONALD MERVYN TO FEEL MARY ARMSTRONG IN HIS ARMS AND TO KNOW AS HE DID HOW SAFE AND CONFIDENT SHE FELT THERE BUT HE DID NOT PRESS HER MORE CLOSELY THAN WAS NECESSARY TO ENABLE HER TO RETAIN HER SEAT
THOUGH ARDENTLY DOES HER MOTHER'S HEART LONG FOR SUCH TIDINGS AS HER THOUGHTS FOLLOW HIM AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH WORDS REASSURED HER
YOU ARE BLEEDING DREADFULLY THE GIRL EXCLAIMED AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS BACK IT'S A TERRIBLE WOUND TO LOOK AT THEN IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS HE LAUGHED THE SPEAR ONLY GLANCED ALONG ON THE RIBS IT'S LUCKY I WAS STOOPING SO MUCH
IT IS LUCKY THOSE MEN CAME IN FIRST AND FOUND THE SNAKES MARY ARMSTRONG SAID FOR WE HAVE NOT GOT HERE THE STUFF WE ALWAYS USE IN THE COLONY AS AN ANTIDOTE AND THEIR BITE IS ALMOST ALWAYS FATAL UNLESS THAT CAN BE USED IN TIME
I KNOW I CAN YOU SAVED MY LIFE ONCE BEFORE HOW DID YOU COME HERE AND OH CAN YOU TELL ME ANY NEWS ABOUT MY FATHER HE IS HURT MISS ARMSTRONG BUT I HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL RECOVER NOW YOU MUST BE STRONG
PETER AGAIN FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLICE AND SENT FOR HIS MOTHER AS USUAL BUT SHE WENT NOT TO HIS RELIEF IN HIS EXTREMITY HE SENT FOR PETER WILLIAMS A RESPECTABLE COLORED BARBER WHOSE NAME HE HAD BEEN WEARING
AT THE SIGHT OF HER POOR CHILD TO HER LET ME GO LET ME GO YOUR ONLY SON PETER VAN WAGENER SINCE THE DATE OF THE LAST LETTER ISABELLA HAS HEARD NO TIDINGS FROM HER LONG ABSENT SON
WHO ARE YOU SIR SHE ASKED TREMBLING I AM SERGEANT BLUNT MISS ARMSTRONG NO WONDER YOU DID NOT KNOW ME I AM GOT UP IN NATIVE FASHION YOU CAN TRUST YOURSELF WITH ME YOU KNOW OH YES YES THE GIRL SOBBED
THE FINGO WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN CHARGE OF IT GALLOPED UP WITH RONALD'S HORSE MARY ARMSTRONG WAS SITTING ON THE GROUND FOR SHE WAS NOW SO UTTERLY EXHAUSTED SHE COULD NO LONGER KEEP HER FEET AND HAD
AS THE DAY WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF THE FINGOES ROSE AND IN LOW TONES THEY EXPRESSED THEIR DELIGHT AT HAVING OUTWITTED THE KAFFIRS NO FOOTSTEPS HAD BEEN HEARD IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SOME TIME AND THEY FELT SURE THAT THE SEARCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED IN THAT QUARTER
AND I ALWAYS CONSIDERED THAT I COULD WALK TWENTY MILES WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE HOW YOU WALK MISS ARMSTRONG NO DOUBT IF YOU HAD BEEN IN GOOD SPIRITS AND WITH A PLEASANT PARTY
I AM SURE I COULD GO ON WALKING NOW IT WAS NOT THE PAIN THAT STOPPED ME
BUT PETER WAS NOT DISPOSED TO CONSENT TO THAT PROPOSITION WHILE THE CITY AND ITS PLEASURES WERE ACCESSIBLE TO HIM ISABELLA NOW BECAME A PREY TO DISTRESSING FEARS DREADING LEST THE NEXT DAY OR HOUR COME FRAUGHT WITH THE REPORT OF SOME DREADFUL CRIME
OUT OF THE OPENING HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY HAD ENTERED THE CAVE HE TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE TO THE CHIEF THE KAFFIRS ARE HUNTING KRETA SAID LISTENING AT THE OPENING THEY COULD HEAR DISTANT SHOUTS THESE WERE ANSWERED FROM MANY POINTS SOME OF THEM COMPARATIVELY CLOSE
WE HAD VERY BAD LUCK WHEN WE FIRST CAME OUT BUT SINCE WE HAVE HAD VERY GOOD SO I AM IN HOPES TO DO WELL YET BUT IF I DO N'T DO WELL YOU NEED NOT EXPECT ME HOME THESE FIVE YEARS SO WRITE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN WON'T YOU
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE SHALL GO FAR BUT NO DOUBT HE WILL FIND SOME SORT OF HIDING PLACE KRETA IN FACT WAS JUST GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS MEN WE ARE GOING OUT TO FIND SOME GOOD PLACE TO HIDE AWAY IN TO DAY HE SAID
I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY AT PRESENT BUT WRITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE YOUR ONLY SON PETER VAN WAGENER ANOTHER CONTAINING THE LAST INTELLIGENCE SHE HAS HAD FROM HER SON READS AS FOLLOWS AND WAS DATED SEPTEMBER NINETEEN
I HAVE NO DOUBT I FEEL SURE THAT HE HAS PERSEVERED AND KEPT THE RESOLVE HE MADE BEFORE HE LEFT HOME HE SEEMED SO DIFFERENT BEFORE HE WENT SO DETERMINED TO DO BETTER
BUT WE LEAVE PATH MANY TIMES AND AFTER I CARRY NO FIND AT ALL MOUNTAINS VERY BIG MUCH BUSH NEVER FIND HERE THE CHIEF NOW TOLD HIS FOLLOWER TO REPLACE THE STONE AND JOIN
I WISH YOU WOULD NOT CALL ME MISS ARMSTRONG IT SEEMS SO FORMAL AND STIFF WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING SUCH TERRIBLE RISKS TO SAVE ME PLEASE CALL ME MARY AND I WILL CALL YOU HARRY I THINK I HEARD YOU TELL MY FATHER YOUR NAME WAS HARRY BLUNT THAT IS THE NAME I ENLISTED UNDER
VERY HARD LUCK BUT ARE IN HOPES TO HAVE BETTER IN TIME TO COME I SHOULD LIKE IF MY SISTERS ARE WELL AND ALL THE PEOPLE ROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD I EXPECT TO BE HOME IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS OR THEREABOUTS I HAVE SEEN SAMUEL LATERETT
NOW I WILL SHIFT THE SADDLE A FEW INCHES FURTHER BACK I THINK YOU HAD BETTER RIDE BEFORE ME FOR YOU ARE COMPLETELY WORN OUT AND I CAN HOLD YOU THERE BETTER THAN YOU COULD HOLD YOURSELF IF YOU WERE TO SIT BEHIND ME HE STRAPPED ON HIS VALISE SHIFTED HIS SADDLE
THESE WERE THE HEART WASTING TRIALS OF WATCHING OVER HER CHILDREN SCATTERED AND IMMINENTLY EXPOSED TO THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE ADVERSARY WITH FEW IF ANY FIXED PRINCIPLES TO SUSTAIN THEM OH SHE SAYS
IT IS NOT MY OWN NAME MEN VERY SELDOM ENLIST UNDER THEIR OWN NAMES WHY NOT SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE PARTLY I SUPPOSE BECAUSE A GOOD MANY OF US GET INTO SCRAPES BEFORE WE ENLIST AND DON'T CARE FOR OUR FRIENDS TO BE ABLE TO TRACE US
THERE THE TALL CEDARS GROW AND THE BRIGHT WATERS FLOW WHERE MY PARENTS WILL GREET ME WHITE MAN LET ME GO LET ME GO TO THE SPOT WHERE THE CATERACT PLAYS WHERE OFT I HAVE SPORTED IN MY BOYISH DAYS AND THERE IS MY POOR MOTHER WHOSE HEART EVER FLOWS
SO AFRAID WAS SHE THAT HE WAS STILL UNFAITHFUL AND DOING WRONG BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR AND AT LENGTH SHE BELIEVED HIM REALLY GONE HE LEFT IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE AND HIS FRIENDS HEARD NOTHING FURTHER FROM HIM
FOR HE HAD NOT WAITED TO PUT ONE ON WHEN HE MOUNTED THE TROOPERS HAD HEARD FROM THEIR COMRADES ON THE RETURN OF THE ESCORT THAT THE SERGEANT HAD BEFORE STARTING GOT HIMSELF UP AS A NATIVE AND THEY WERE NOT THEREFORE SURPRISED AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HIS BLACK SKIN
THOUGH UNENCUMBERED HE HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE BUSHES WHICH SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS FLESH TERRIBLY BUT THE CHIEF SEEMED TO BE POSSESSED OF THE EYES OF A BAT AND GLIDED THROUGH THEM SCARCELY MOVING A TWIG AS HE PASSED
THEY WERE NOT OUT OF DANGER YET FOR PARTIES OF KAFFIRS MIGHT BE MET WITH AT ANY TIME UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN MUSKET SHOT OF KING WILLIAMSTOWN THE FINGOES RAN AT A PACE THAT KEPT THE HORSE AT A SHARP TROT
IN ABOUT AN HOUR RONALD WHO HAD BEEN HALF LYING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND THAT THE CHIEF HAD STOLEN AWAY HE SAT UP AND WATCHED THE HUT INTENTLY
RONALD WITH KRETA AND TWO OF HIS MEN NOW CREPT DOWN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE BUSHES AT A SPOT WHERE THEY COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE HUT FOR A LONG TIME FEMALE FIGURES CAME IN AND OUT
BUT ME AND MY MEN CAN CREEP THROUGH BUT WE MUST NOT CALL TO YOU INCOS THE KAFFIRS WOULD HEAR US AND BE ON THE WATCH SAFEST PLAN FOR US TO GO THROUGH FIRST NOT GO ALONG PATHS BUT THROUGH BUSH THEN FOR YOU TO GALLOP STRAIGHT THROUGH EVEN IF THEY CLOSE TO PATH
ALONG WITH THE TEN DOLLARS OF MISSUS AND WHILE HIS MOTHER AND HER FRIEND BELIEVED HIM IMPROVING AT SCHOOL HE WAS TO THEIR LATENT SORROW IMPROVING IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE OR PLACES AND ON ENTIRELY OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES
WHICH WHEN COMPLETED WAS IN THE FORM OF A TINY WIGWAM AT THE BACK OF THIS WAS PLACED A CHUNK OF THE CARIBOU MEAT AND IN FRONT OF THIS BAIT SO THAT AN ANIMAL WOULD HAVE TO SPRING IT IN PASSING
SHOOT FROM THERE HE POINTED TO A CLUMP OF SPRUCE A DOZEN RODS AWAY BY ROD'S WATCH IT WAS NOW NEARLY NOON AND THE TWO SAT DOWN TO EAT THE SANDWICHES THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM ONLY A FEW MINUTES WERE LOST IN TAKING UP THE HOME TRAIL
WITH A POWERFUL EFFORT ROD STEADIED HIMSELF THE BUCK WAS STANDING BROADSIDE HIS HEAD AND NECK STRETCHED UP OFFERING A BEAUTIFUL SHOT AT THE VITAL SPOT BEHIND HIS FORE LEG AT THIS THE YOUNG HUNTER AIMED AND FIRED
UP THE HILL AND OVER INTO THE WILDERNESS DESOLATION BEYOND WHEN ROD LOOKED AT WABI HE SAW THAT THE INDIAN BOY'S EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING WITH AN EXPRESSION IN THEM THAT WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN FRIGHT AND HORROR
AND WITH HIS COMPANION'S ASSISTANCE HOISTED THE CARCASS UNTIL IT WAS CLEAR OF THE GROUND IF SOMETHIN HAPPEN WE NO COME BACK TO NIGHT HEEM SAFE FROM WOLF HE EXPLAINED THE TWO NOW CONTINUED THROUGH THE SWAMP AT ITS FARTHER EDGE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY FROM THE CREEK TOWARD THE HILLS
FROM THAT DAY ON MUKOKI WAS A DIFFERENT INDIAN HE BECAME THE GREATEST WOLF HUNTER IN ALL THESE REGIONS SOON AFTER THE TRAGEDY HE CAME TO THE POST TO LIVE AND SINCE THEN HE HAS NOT LEFT MINNETAKI AND ME ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE WHEN THE NIGHT IS JUST RIGHT
BUT ON THE OTHER IT FELL IN ALMOST SHEER WALLS FORMING AT ITS BASE FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW A NARROW AND GLOOMY CHASM THROUGH WHICH A SMALL STREAM FOUND ITS WAY SEVERAL TIMES MUKOKI STOPPED AND LEANED PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO THE DIZZY EDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN
TWICE THAT NIGHT ROD WAS AWAKENED BY MUKOKI OPENING THE CABIN DOOR THE SECOND TIME HE RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOWS AND QUIETLY WATCHED THE OLD WARRIOR IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY CLEAR NIGHT AND A FLOOD OF MOONLIGHT WAS POURING INTO THE CAMP
AND THIS SLOPING PLAIN WAS COVERED WITH HUGE BOULDERS AND A THIN GROWTH OF LARGE SPRUCE AND BIRCH JUST BEYOND THE CREEK WAS A GIGANTIC ROCK WHICH IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT MUKOKI'S ATTENTION
HE COULD HEAR MUKOKI CHUCKLING AND GRUNTING AS THOUGH COMMUNICATING WITH HIMSELF AND AT LAST HIS CURIOSITY GETTING THE BETTER OF HIM
MANY WOLF NEAR HE EXCLAIMED MANY WOLF OFF THERE N OFF THERE N OFF THERE GOOD PLACE FOR NIGHT HUNT SOON THE CREEK SWUNG OUT FROM THE RIDGE AND CUT A CIRCUITOUS CHANNEL THROUGH A SMALL SWAMP
HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO WHISPER SEE IF I'M NOT RIGHT
NO LONGER DID HE SEEM ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THE DISCOVERY OF SIGNS OF FUR ANIMALS
WE KEPT WOLF SEWED UP HIS SIDE AND THROAT TAMED HIM AND TO MORROW NIGHT YOU WILL SEE HOW MUKOKI HAS TAUGHT HIM TO GET EVEN WITH HIS PEOPLE IT WAS TWO HOURS LATER WHEN ROD AND WABIGOON EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLES AND RETURNED TO THEIR BLANKETS
UNTIL AT LAST WITH A CURIOUS THRILLING CERTAINTY THAT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING HE CAUGHT MUKOKI BY THE ARM AND POINTING BACK SAID
THE GREAT CREATOR ROBS THE REST OF THE WORLD OF THE SUN THAT IT MAY SHINE IN ALL ITS GLORY UPON THEIR OWN SAVAGE LAND FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL THAT SHELTERED THEIR HOME ROD LOOKED OUT OVER THE GLISTENING FORESTS AND LAKES IN RAPT AND SPEECHLESS ADMIRATION
SEE IF I AM NOT RIGHT TO MORROW NIGHT IF MUKOKI COMES BACK BY THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME EXCITING SPORT WITH THE WOLVES AND THEN YOU WILL SEE HOW WOLF OUT THERE DOES HIS WORK THERE FOLLOWED SEVERAL MINUTES OF SILENCE
WHEN THE BOY HAD COME NEAR ENOUGH HE PASSED BACK HIS RIFLE AND HIS LIPS FORMED THE ALMOST NOISELESS WORD SHOOT TREMBLINGLY ROD SEIZED THE GUN AND LOOKED INTO THE SWAMP AHEAD MUKOKI DOUBLING DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM
ONE DAY MUKOKI CAME TO THE POST WITH A LITTLE BUNDLE OF FUR AND MOST OF THE THINGS HE GOT IN EXCHANGE FOR IT MOTHER SAYS WERE FOR THE KID HE REACHED THE STORE AT NIGHT AND EXPECTED TO LEAVE FOR HOME THE NEXT NOON WHICH WOULD BRING HIM TO HIS CAMP BEFORE DARK
THE SUN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW ITSELF ABOVE THE WILDERNESS WHEN THE HUNTERS LEFT CAMP AS MUKOKI HAD PREDICTED IT WAS A GLORIOUS DAY ONE OF THOSE BITTERLY COLD CLOUDLESS DAYS WHEN AS THE INDIANS BELIEVE
WHAT HE SAW SENT HIM FOR A MOMENT INTO THE FIRST NERVOUS TREMOR OF BUCK FEVER NOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY STOOD A MAGNIFICENT BUCK BROWSING THE TIPS OF A CLUMP OF HAZEL
BUT THE INDIANS AT THE POST BELIEVE THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES HE GOES CRAZY OVER WOLVES WOLVES EXCLAIMED ROD YES WOLVES AND HE HAS GOOD REASON A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO JUST ABOUT WHEN YOU AND I WERE BORN MUKOKI HAD A WIFE AND CHILD
SMART FELLOW LYNX WOLF AND FOX TOO IS A MINK WORTH MUCH FI DOLLAR
SOME MYSTERIOUS ALL ABSORBING JOY REVEALED IN EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS FACE WOLF NIGHT HE WHISPERED HE LOOKED BACK TO WHERE WABI WAS SLEEPING WOLF NIGHT HE REPEATED AND SLIPPED LIKE A SHADOW TO THE SIDE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS YOUNG HUNTER
BUT WITH THE OLD LIGHT BACK IN HIS EYES SUDDENLY HE ASKED DID MINNETAKI EVER TELL YOU ANYTHING QUEER ABOUT MUKOKI ROD NOTHING MORE THAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME YOURSELF WELL
AND IT WAS EVIDENT TO ROD THAT THE INDIAN CONSIDERED HIS MISSION FOR THAT DAY PRACTICALLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER TAKING THE HEART LIVER AND ONE OF THE HIND QUARTERS OF THE BUCK MUKOKI DREW A LONG ROPE OF BABEESH FROM HIS PACK TIED ONE END OF IT AROUND THE ANIMAL'S NECK FLUNG THE OTHER END OVER A NEAR LIMB
ROD REGARDED HIS ACTIONS WITH GROWING WONDER HE SAW HIM BEND OVER WABI SHAKE HIM BY THE SHOULDERS AND HEARD HIM REPEAT AGAIN WOLF NIGHT WOLF NIGHT WABI AWOKE AND SAT UP IN HIS BLANKETS AND MUKOKI CAME BACK TO THE DOOR
AND EVEN THIS ONE COULD NOT BE CLIMBED WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A SAPLING OR TWO THEY COULD SEE HOWEVER THAT THE TOP OF THE ROCK WAS FLAT AND MUKOKI CALLED ATTENTION TO THIS FACT WITH AN EXULTANT CHUCKLE FINE PLACE FOR WOLF HUNT HE EXCLAIMED MANY WOLF OFF THERE IN SWAMP AN IN HILL
SUDDENLY MUKOKI STOPPED AND A HAND WAS HELD OUT BEHIND HIM WARNINGLY HE TURNED HIS FACE BACK AND ROD KNEW THAT HE SAW GAME INCH BY INCH HE CROUCHED UPON HIS SNOW SHOES AND BECKONED FOR ROD TO APPROACH SLOWLY QUIETLY
FIFTEEN FOX TRAPS AND AS MANY LARGER ONES FOR LYNX AND WOLVES WABI EQUIPPED HIMSELF WITH TWENTY OF THE SMALL TRAPS AND FOUR EACH OF FOX AND LYNX TRAPS
MUKY IS A WIZARD WHEN IT COMES TO HUNTING WOLVES WABI WENT ON HE HAS STUDIED THEM AND THOUGHT OF THEM EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT WOLVES THAN ALL THE REST OF THE HUNTERS IN THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER HE CAN CATCH THEM IN EVERY TRAP HE SETS
AND THE WOMAN CHANGED INTO MINNETAKI AND THE RAVENOUS WOLVES INTO MEN
BUILD HOUSE TO KEEP SNOW OFF TRAPS NO DO THAT BE DIGGING OUT TRAPS ALL WINTER WHEN MINK HEEM SMELL MEAT GO IN HOUSE HE GOT TO GO OVER TRAP MAKE HOUSE FOR ALL SMALL ANIMAL LIKE HEEM NO GOOD FOR LYNX HE SEE HOUSE
CONTINUED MUKOKI T'REE MEBBY FOUR MEBBY FIVE BUILD TRAP HOUSE RIGHT HERE NEVER BEFORE HAD ROD SEEN A TRAP SET AS THE OLD INDIAN NOW SET HIS VERY NEAR THE END OF THE LOG OVER WHICH THE MINK MADE THEIR TRAIL HE QUICKLY BUILT A SHELTER OF STICKS
CAREFULLY COVERED WITH SNOW AND A FEW LEAVES WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES MUKOKI HAD BUILT TWO OF THESE SHELTERS AND HAD SET TWO TRAPS WHY DO YOU BUILD THOSE LITTLE HOUSES ASKED ROD AS THEY AGAIN TOOK UP THEIR TRAIL MUCH SNOW COME IN WINTER ELUCIDATED THE INDIAN
HE SPOKE IN WHISPERS AND ROD FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE FREQUENTLY THE TWO WOULD STOP AND SCAN THE OPENINGS FOR SIGNS OF LIFE TWICE THEY SET FOX TRAPS WHERE THERE WERE EVIDENT SIGNS OF RUNWAYS IN A WILD RAVINE STREWN WITH TUMBLED TREES AND MASSES OF ROCK THEY STRUCK A LYNX TRACK
MUKOKI SEEMS TO GO A LITTLE MAD HE CALLS THIS A WOLF NIGHT NO ONE CAN STOP HIM FROM GOING OUT NO ONE CAN GET HIM TO TALK HE WILL ALLOW NO ONE TO ACCOMPANY HIM WHEN IN SUCH A MOOD HE WILL WALK MILES AND MILES TO NIGHT BUT HE WILL COME BACK
PEERING DOWN WITH CRITICAL EYES AND ONCE WHEN HE PULLED HIMSELF BACK CAUTIOUSLY BY MEANS OF A SMALL SAPLING HE EXPLAINED HIS INTEREST BY SAYING PLENTY BEAR THERE IN SPRING BUT ROD WAS NOT THINKING OF BEARS
ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD MUKOKI SAID AND WHILE HE WAS IN THE TRAP HELPLESS AND UNABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF THREE OR FOUR OF HIS LOVELY TRIBE JUMPED UPON HIM AND TRIED TO KILL HIM FOR BREAKFAST WE HOVE IN SIGHT JUST IN TIME TO DRIVE THE CANNIBALS OFF
HERE MUKOKI SET ANOTHER TRAP A LITTLE FARTHER STILL THEY CAME ACROSS A FISHER TRAIL AND ANOTHER TRAP WAS LAID CARIBOU AND DEER TRACKS CROSSED AND RECROSSED THE CREEK BUT THE INDIAN PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THEM
SUDDENLY HOWEVER THEIR TALK TOOK A DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING TURN AND ALETHIA LISTENED WITH WIDE EYED ATTENTION
THE SNEERING UNSAVOURY SMILE THAT ALWAYS CHARACTERISED THE SIR JASPERS OF THIS WORLD IT WAS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE SHE MUST FORCE HERSELF TO MEET HIM WITH OUTWARD CALM
AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE COHEN AL ABTAN HAD TOLD THE YOUTHS THIS MUCH
SO SOME OF THEM FELL TO HEWING STONES AND SOME TO BUILDING WHILST OTHERS PLASTERED AND PAINTED AND FURNISHED NOR DID THE DAY DAWN ERE THE ORDINANCE OF THE PALACE WAS COMPLETE
A LOOK OF FRIGHTENED DESPAIR CREPT INTO HER EYES NEVER IN ANY NOVEL THAT SHE HAD READ HAD A DEFENCELESS YOUNG WOMAN BEEN CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS SIR JOHN THE HUGO OF HER IMAGINATION WAS
YE HAVE DIVIDED THE GOLD AND THE JEWELS BUT THIS MAY NOT BE DIVIDED NOR CAN ITS VALUE BE MADE UP IN MONEY AND IF IT BE CUT IN TWAIN ITS SPELL WILL BE VOIDED SO LEAVE IT WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU TO EAT FROM IT AT ALL TIMES
AND GIVE THE BEARER AN HUNDRED DINARS THE FIRST THAT CAME TO THEE THE SONS OF THE RED KING SLEW AND SO DID THEY WITH MY SECOND BROTHER BUT AGAINST ME THEY COULD NOT PREVAIL AND I LAID HANDS ON THEM
SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM TO TAKE THIS BOOK SO WE ALL AGREED TO THIS CONDITION AND HE CONTINUED O MY SONS
GATHERED TOGETHER ALL HE FOUND IN THE TREASURY AND RETURNED WITH THE TWO PAIRS OF SADDLE BAGS AND THE DEPOSITS THEREIN
APPARENTLY THEY HAD JUST FOREGATHERED AFTER A DAY'S BUSINESS AND THEIR CONVERSATION CONSISTED OF A RAPID EXCHANGE OF SHORT FRIENDLY INQUIRIES AS TO HEALTH FAMILY STOCK AND SO FORTH AND SOME GRUMBLING REMARKS ON THE WEATHER
NOW ALETHIA CAME TO THINK OF IT IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF MATTERBY TOWERS WHILE IN THE ACT OF OPENING A WESLEYAN BAZAAR BECAUSE HE WAS SUSPECTED UNJUSTLY AS IT TURNED OUT AFTERWARDS OF HAVING BEATEN THE GERMAN GOVERNESS TO DEATH
AND SHE ANSWERED WITH THE GUESTS THEY REJOINED HAPLY HE WENT AWAY WITH THEM WHILST WE SLEPT O MOTHER IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE HAD TASTED OF STRANGERHOOD AND YEARNED TO GET AT HIDDEN HOARDS
AND THIS MONSTER WAS GOING TO MEET HER AT DERRELTON STATION IN A FEW SHORT MINUTES SHE WOULD KNOW HIM AT ONCE HE WOULD HAVE THE DARK BEETLING BROWS THE QUICK FURTIVE GLANCE
BEARING HER FEEBLE HEALTH WITH UNCOMPLAINING FORTITUDE AND HAVING A KIND WORD FOR THE GARDENER'S BOY AND A SUNNY SMILE FOR THE CHANCE VISITOR OR ELSE SHE WOULD BE COLD AND PEEVISH WITH EYES THAT PIERCED YOU LIKE A GIMLET
AND THEY ATE AND TOOK THEIR EASE AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
BY THE ALMIGHTY HADST THOU NOT CAST THE NET OVER ME AND PULLED ME OUT I SHOULD HAVE KEPT HOLD OF THESE TWO FISHES TILL I SANK AND WAS DROWNED FOR I COULD NOT GET ASHORE OF MYSELF QUOTH JUDAR
JUDAR WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER WHO ROSE WEEPING AND GREETED HIM FONDLY AND TOLD HIM HOW THE KING HAD BEATEN HIS BROTHERS
MAY THY HEAD LIVE AND THE JEW SAID THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE COVETOUS THEN HE TOOK THE MULE AND GAVE JUDAR AN HUNDRED DINARS WITH WHICH HE RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER O MY SON
BUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE HAD GONE UNSUSPECTINGLY TO VISIT SIR JOHN CHOBHAM AND WARN HIM OF HIS DANGER
SO HE RUBBED THE RING
THEN THEY DIVIDED THE GOLD AND JEWELS BETWEEN THEM BUT A BRABBLE AROSE BETWEEN THEM CONCERNING THE ENCHANTED SADDLE BAGS
AFTER BREAKFAST ALETHIA ON THE PRETEXT OF GOING TO LOOK AT AN OUTLYING ROSE GARDEN SLIPPED AWAY TO THE VILLAGE THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING SHE REMEMBERED
A GRAPHIC TWELVE DAYS OLD A YET OLDER COPY OF PUNCH AND ONE OR TWO LOCAL PAPERS LAY UPON THE CENTRAL TABLE THE OTHER TABLES WERE STACKED FOR THE MOST PART WITH CHESS AND DRAUGHTS BOARDS AND WOODEN BOXES OF CHESSMEN AND DOMINOES
THERE WAS SIR JASPER WHO WAS UTTERLY VILE AND ABSOLUTELY UNSCRUPULOUS AND THERE WAS NEVIL WHO WAS NOT REALLY BAD AT HEART BUT HAD A WEAK MOUTH AND USUALLY REQUIRED THE LIFE WORK OF TWO GOOD WOMEN
GO THOU AND TAKE LEAVE OF HIM AND COME BACK FORTH RIGHT
HE MAY THEREWITH MAKE HIMSELF MASTER OF THE EARTH IN ALL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH THEREOF AS FOR THE BRAND IF ITS BEARER DRAW IT AND BRANDISH IT AGAINST AN ARMY
IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE WEBBLEHINTON THE WORLD WHERE THE GREAT DRAMAS OF SIN AND VILLAINY ARE PLAYED UNCEASINGLY
HE CONTINUED HIS TALE AS FOLLOWS SO YOUR FATHER RETURNED EMPTY HANDED
IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE SHOCK TO HER TO FIND THAT ROBERT WAS FAIR WITH A SNUB NOSE MERRY EYE AND RATHER A SCHOOLBOY MANNER A SERPENT IN DUCKLING'S PLUMAGE WAS HER PRIVATE COMMENT
HE HATH BUT TO FACE THE PLANISPHERE TOWARDS THE SUN'S DISC SAYING LET SUCH A CITY BE BURNT AND THAT CITY WILL BE CONSUMED WITH FIRE
AND I WILL CONTENT ME WITH AN HUNDRED DINARS FOR EACH DEAD MAN THEN HE TOOK THE MULE TO THE JEW WHO SEEING HIM ASKED THE OTHER IS DEAD
AT MOST OF THE STATIONS NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT TO GET INTO THE TRAIN OR TO LEAVE IT BUT AT ONE THERE WERE SEVERAL MARKET FOLK ON THE PLATFORM AND TWO MEN OF THE FARMER OR SMALL CATTLE DEALER CLASS ENTERED ALETHIA'S CARRIAGE
AND WE DIVIDED AMONGST US HIS TREASURES AND TALISMANS TILL WE CAME TO THE BOOKS WHEN WE FELL OUT OVER A VOLUME CALLED THE FABLES OF THE ANCIENTS WHOSE LIKE IS NOT IN THE WORLD
LISTLESSLY SHE PICKED UP ONE OF THE PAPERS THE SENTINEL AND GLANCED AT ITS CONTENTS SUDDENLY SHE STARTED AND BEGAN TO READ WITH BREATHLESS ATTENTION A PROMINENTLY PRINTED ARTICLE HEADED A LITTLE LIMELIGHT ON SIR JOHN CHOBHAM
SHE HAD EMBARKED ON A SOCIAL ADVENTURE OF NO LITTLE MAGNITUDE AS COMPARED WITH THE ACCUSTOMED SECLUSION AND STAGNATION OF HER PAST LIFE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT
IN THE NOVEL SHE HAD JUST BEEN READING SO SHE RECOGNISED THAT SUCH A PROCEEDING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THE TRAIN WHICH CARRIED ALETHIA TOWARDS HER DESTINATION WAS A LOCAL ONE WITH THE WAYSIDE STATION HABIT STRONGLY DEVELOPED
WHO TOOK BOTH UP AND PLUNGED WITH THEM INTO THE EARTH THEY SWOONED AWAY FOR EXCESS OF FEAR AND WHEN THEY RECOVERED THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THEIR MOTHER'S HOUSE
AND THEY SAID TO HIM WE WILL TAKE THEE WITH US AND OPEN THE TREASURE TO THEE SHE ENQUIRED HATH HE THEN BEEN IN COMPANY WITH MOORS AND THEY REPLIED SAYING WERE THEY NOT OUR GUESTS YESTER NIGHT AND SHE
WERE DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY EITHER TO RELIGION OR TO POULTRY AND THE WORLD OF POLITICS WAS TO HER AN UNHEEDED UNEXPLORED REGION HER IDEAS ON LIFE IN GENERAL HAD BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POPULAR RESPECTABLE NOVEL WRITERS
AND FORTY OTHERS BROUGHT MALE CHATTELS AND CARRIED THEM ALL TO JUDAR'S HOUSE WHICH THEY FILLED
O MY LORD I HAVE LEFT NOTHING IN THE TREASURY JUDAR GAVE THE TREASURE TO HIS MOTHER BIDDING HER KEEP IT AND LAYING THE ENCHANTED SADDLE BAGS BEFORE HIM SAID TO THE JINNI I COMMAND THEE TO BUILD ME THIS NIGHT A LOFTY PALACE
FEAR NOTHING THEN SAID JUDAR TO THE SERVANT I COMMAND THEE TO BRING ME ALL THAT IS IN THE KING'S TREASURY OF GOODS AND SUCH LET NOTHING REMAIN AND FETCH THE TWO PAIRS OF SADDLE BAGS HE TOOK FROM MY BROTHERS I HEAR AND I OBEY
ANSWERED ROBERT THAT IS HIS HOUSE AWAY THERE AMONG THE TREES ON THE RIGHT SO THERE WAS AN UPRIGHT MAN POSSIBLY A VERY HUGO IN CHARACTER WHO WAS THWARTING AND DEFYING THE EVILDOER IN HIS NEFARIOUS CAREER
I WILL TAKE THEM AND THEY CAME TO HIGH WORDS
I WOULD HAVE THEE DO WITH ME AS THOU DIDST WITH MY BROTHER THEN HE GAVE HIM A SILKEN CORD SAYING BIND MY HANDS BEHIND ME AND THROW ME IN AND IF I FARE AS DID MY BROTHER
HER IMAGINATION FOUNDED ON HER EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE ONE MET IN NOVELS HAD TO SUPPLY THE GAPS THE MOTHER WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO PLACE SHE WOULD EITHER BE AN ULTRA AMIABLE OLD LADY
AND OVERLAY IT WITH LIQUID GOLD AND FURNISH IT WITH MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE AND LET NOT THE DAY DAWN ERE THOU BE QUIT OF THE WHOLE WORK REPLIED HE THY BIDDING SHALL BE OBEYED AND SANK INTO THE EARTH
DID YOU SEE THE WAY THE ARGUS SHOWED HIM UP THIS WEEK PROPERLY EXPOSED HIM HIP AND THIGH I TELL YOU AND SO ON THEY RAN IN THEIR WITHERING INDICTMENT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS ALETHIA'S COUSIN AND PROSPECTIVE HOST
WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTEENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
AND BE CONTENT TO TAKE A MORSEL WITH YOU IF YE ALLOW ME AUGHT TO CLOTHE ME
HOW LONG SHALL WE ABIDE IN THIS PRISON DEATH WOULD BE RELIEF AS HE SPOKE BEHOLD THE EARTH CLOVE IN SUNDER
AT ONCE PACKED HIM OFF TO SUEZ
SO HE GAVE HIM THE TWENTY DUCATS
WHO SHALL GIVE THEE AN HUNDRED DINARS QUOTH JUDAR SINCE THOU KNOWEST ALL THIS WHY AND WHEREFORE DOST THOU QUESTION ME
WHEN THE BAKER AFTER SUMMING UP WHAT WAS DUE TO HIM SAID I STILL OWE THEE TWO DAYS BREAD REPLIED GOOD AND WENT ON TO THE BUTCHER TO WHOM HE GAVE A GOLD PIECE AND TOOK MEAT SAYING
TO KEEP HIM FROM ULTIMATE DISASTER IT WAS PROBABLE ALETHIA CONSIDERED THAT ROBERT CAME INTO THE LAST CATEGORY IN WHICH CASE SHE WAS CERTAIN TO ENJOY THE COMPANIONSHIP OF ONE OR TWO EXCELLENT WOMEN AND MIGHT POSSIBLY CATCH GLIMPSES
GAVE THEM NO VERY FRIENDLY LOOKS AND ALETHIA THOUGHT SHE HEARD A FURTIVE HISS A MOMENT LATER THEY CAME UPON AN ERRAND BOY RIDING A BICYCLE HE HAD THE FRANK OPEN COUNTENANCE NEATLY BRUSHED HAIR AND TIDY CLOTHES
THEN HE DREW OUT FOR HIM A GEOMANTIC FIGURE
SO THE JINNI FETCHED ALL THAT WAS NEEDED AND CLAD THE FEMALE SLAVES SAYING TO THEM THIS IS YOUR MISTRESS KISS HER HANDS AND CROSS HER NOT
SO HE LOOKED OUT AND LISTENING HEARD ALL THE ANGRY WORDS THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
AND NEXT MORNING HE TOOK HIS NET AND GOING DOWN TO LAKE KARUN STOOD THERE AND WAS ABOUT TO CAST HIS NET WHEN BEHOLD THERE CAME UP TO HIM A SECOND MAGHRIBI RIDING ON A SHE MULE MORE HANDSOMELY ACCOUTRED
SO HE WENT IN TO THEM AND SAID
AND DO THOU COMMAND HIM TO DO WHATEVER THOU DESIREST FOR HE WILL NOT GAINSAY THEE NOW GO TO THINE OWN COUNTRY AND TAKE CARE OF THE RING FOR BY MEANS OF IT THOU WILT BAFFLE THINE ENEMIES
ROBERT MERELY LAUGHED THAT WAS HOW HE TOOK THE SCORN AND CONDEMNATION OF HIS FELLOW MEN HE HAD GOADED THEM TO DESPERATION WITH HIS SHAMELESS DEPRAVITY TILL THEY SPOKE OPENLY OF PUTTING HIM TO A VIOLENT DEATH
WITH WHOM HE ABODE TILL THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE PILGRIMAGE RITES
AND TAKEN THE TWO PAIRS OF SADDLE BAGS WHICH WHEN HE HEARD IT WAS NO LIGHT MATTER TO HIM AND HE SAID TO HER GRIEVE NOT FOR THE PAST I WILL SHOW THEE WHAT I CAN DO AND BRING MY BROTHERS HITHER FORTH RIGHT
OH WHOSE ARE THEY SHE ASKED HOW HAPPY ANY MAN MUST BE WHO IS THE MASTER OF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES THEY ARE YOUR HABOGI'S REPLIED HE AND THE ONE WHICH YOU THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL
AND HE HASTENED FORWARD SO FAST THAT HE FELL HEADLONG INTO A PIT WHERE THE BEAR WAS SITTING BEFORE HE COULD PICK HIMSELF UP
AND TWO CREATURES NEITHER BEAST NOR HUMAN STOOD BEFORE THE CHIEF NOW THE BEAR CHIEF OF COURSE KNEW THAT THE BOYS FATHER WOULD SEEK FOR HIS SONS WHEN THEY DID NOT RETURN HOME
THE MOUNTAIN WILL OPEN TO LET YOU IN AND THE HUNTERS WILL FOLLOW YOU THEN I SHALL HAVE THEM IN MY POWER AND BE ABLE TO REVENGE MYSELF THE SERVANT BOWED LOW
HOW DID YOU GET UNDER THAT ROCK ASKED THEY MAKING A RING ROUND HIM BUT THEY HAD TO REPEAT THEIR QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE WOLVERINE WOULD ANSWER FOR HE
AND PUT THEIR PAWS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND THEY ALL THREE WEPT TOGETHER
THE CHESTNUT NO I THINK AFTER ALL I LIKE THE COAL BLACK ONE BEST WITH THE LITTLE WHITE STAR ON HIS FOREHEAD OH DO STOP JUST FOR A MINUTE BUT HABOGI WOULD NOT STOP OR LISTEN
IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT THERE ARE A GREAT MANY SIGMUNDS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD REPLIED HER FATHER SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHOICE AND WHAT DO YOU SAY HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SECOND OH
AND EVERY TIME A BEAR WAS KILLED HIS SHADOW RETURNED TO THE HOUSE OF THE BEAR CHIEF WITH THE MARKS OF HIS WOUNDS PLAINLY TO BEE SEEN BY THE REST
AND HE COULD NOT START THAT DAY BUT EARLY NEXT MORNING HE CALLED HIS LITTLE DOG REDMOUTH WHOM HE KEPT IN A BOX AND SET OUT AFTER HE HAD FOLLOWED THE TRAIL FOR A GREAT DISTANCE HE GREW VERY TIRED
CONTINUED THE WOLVERINE I AM AFRAID THAT YOU WERE NOT TAUGHT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
MY NAME IS HABOGI AND HELGA MUST BE MY WIFE WAS ALL HE SAID AND THOUGH HELGA STOOD PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SURPRISE SHE DID NOT TRY TO RUN AWAY
I NEVER HEARD BEFORE THAT I HAD A BROTHER GOT UP AND RAN QUICKLY TO A TREE UP WHICH SHE CLIMBED NOW THE WOLVERINE WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE SAW HIS DINNER VANISHING IN FRONT OF HIM ESPECIALLY
KILLED HIM INSTANTLY WITH AN ARROW AT THE FORK OF THE TRAIL ON THEIR WAY HOME THEY MET THE YOUNGEST WHO HAD TAKEN THE LEFT HAND ROAD AND HAD SHOT A BEAR FOR HIMSELF
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO CHOOSE ONE WAS ALL HE ANSWERED
SHOT ONE OF HIS ARROWS AT THE ROOT OF THE TREE WHEREUPON A NOISE LIKE THUNDER SHOOK IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FIRE BROKE OUT AND IN A FEW MINUTES A LITTLE HEAP OF ASHES
HE FINISHED IT WITHOUT EVEN ASKING THE MOUSE'S LEAVE AT LAST THE COAT WAS READY AND THE WOLVERINE PUT IT ON
WILL RUN OUT AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN SO THE BEAR PROMISED TO LIE VERY STILL BUT THE MOMENT THE CRANBERRIES TOUCHED HER EYES SHE SPRANG UP WITH A ROAR
SHE FOUND HERSELF ANSWERING INSTEAD IF I DO MARRY IT WILL BE TO NO ONE EXCEPT HABOGI
OH WHAT LOVELY COWS CRIED HELGA AGAIN I AM SURE THEIR MILK MUST BE SWEETER
THE BEAR HAD QUIETLY BROKEN HIS NECK AND HIDING THE BODY UNDER THE SNOW SAT DOWN TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD PASS THAT WAY MEANWHILE THE MOTHER AT HOME WAS WONDERING WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TWO SONS
THE SONS WERE RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HEARING THIS AND THOUGH THERE WAS PLENTY OF MEAT TO LAST FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY STARTED OFF EARLY IN THE MORNING DOWN THE SAME TRAIL THAT THEY HAD FOLLOWED BEFORE
BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE WHICH WAS TO BE HER HOME THEIR HEARTS GREW LIGHT AGAIN
AT LENGTH HABOGI DREW REIN BEFORE A SMALL HOUSE VERY UGLY AND MEAN LOOKING AND THAT SEEMED ON THE POINT OF TUMBLING TO PIECES THIS IS MY HOUSE
FELT QUITE DAZZLED AND FEEDING ON THE GRASS WERE A QUANTITY OF LARGE FAT SHEEP WITH THE CURLIEST AND WHITEST WOOL IN THE WORLD WHAT LOVELY SHEEP WHOSE ARE THEY CRIED HELGA
HOPED BY PUTTING IT OFF THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN BUT THE SISTERS WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN RATHER JEALOUS OF HELGA WERE SECRETLY PLEASED THAT THEIR BRIDEGROOMS SHOULD OUTSHINE HERS
HE TOOK OFF THE SKIN AND STEALING SOME FIRE FROM A TENT WHICH HIS SHARP EYES HAD PERCEIVED HIDDEN BEHIND A ROCK HE SET ABOUT ROASTING THE BEAR BIT BY BIT
YOU WERE LOST WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL AND WENT OUT PICKING BERRIES AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER DAY THAT WE HEARD FROM A BEAVER
AND I CHALLENGED THE ROCK TO CATCH ME OF COURSE I THOUGHT I COULD RUN THE FASTEST BUT I TRIPPED AND IT ROLLED ON ME IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT IT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR BEING SO SILLY SAID THEY
THEN THE WOLVERINE WENT UP CLOSE AND STRUCK THE ROCK A BLOW
HE LED HER UP THE STEPS BUT WHEN SHE GOT INSIDE SHE STOOD QUITE BEWILDERED AT THE BEAUTY OF ALL AROUND HER NONE OF HER FRIENDS OWNED SUCH THINGS
WELL WILL YOU CATCH ME NOW I CAN'T WALK BUT I CAN ROLL ANSWERED THE ROCK AND THE WOLVERINE LAUGHED AND SAID OH THAT WILL DO JUST AS WELL
THE AIR WAS WARM AND DAMP AND THE SNOW SOFT AND SLUSHY AND THE ELDER BROTHER'S BOWSTRING HUNG LOOSE WHILE THE BOW OF THE YOUNGER CAUGHT IN A TREE AND SNAPPED IN HALF AT THAT MOMENT THE DOGS
AND SAT UPON THE BRANCH OF A TREE TO REST BUT REDMOUTH BARKED SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE BOY THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS PARENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED UNDER ITS BRANCHES AND STEPPING BACK
DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE BEAR IS LYING CLOSE TO YOU WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT HIM AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY PRESSED FORWARD TO DRIVE HIS ARROW INTO THE HEART OF THE BEAR BUT THE ELDER ONE CAUGHT HIS RAISED ARM AND WHISPERED
EACH FROM A DIFFERENT TREE AND WINGED WITH THE FEATHERS OF FOUR DIFFERENT BIRDS HE THEN MADE HIMSELF A BOW VERY LIGHT AND STRONG AND GOT DOWN HIS SNOW SHOES ALL THIS TOOK SOME TIME
AND WHEN HER SISTERS WANTED TO GO OUT SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO STAY AT HOME AND DO THEIR WORK YEARS PASSED QUICKLY WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY AND ONE DAY THE PARENTS SUDDENLY PERCEIVED THAT ALL THREE GIRLS WERE GROWN UP
NOT EVEN THE MILLER WHO WAS THE RICHEST MAN SHE KNEW THERE WERE CARPETS EVERYWHERE THICK AND SOFT AND OF DEEP RICH COLOURS AND THE CUSHIONS WERE OF SILK AND MADE YOU SLEEPY
AND YOU WILL SOON BE ABLE TO SEE AS FAR AS ME IT TOOK THE BEAR A LONG WHILE TO GATHER THE BERRIES FOR SHE WAS SLOW ABOUT EVERYTHING
AS SHE THOUGHT THAT THE MAN WHO POSSESSED SUCH WONDERFUL SHEEP AND COWS AND HORSES MIGHT HAVE BUILT HIMSELF A PRETTIER PLACE TO LIVE IN BUT SHE DID NOT SAY SO AND TAKING HER ARM
HABOGI ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED TWO PEASANTS WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS AND AS GENERALLY HAPPENS THE YOUNGEST WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST TEMPERED
AND HE KNEW IN AN INSTANT WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED LET MY DOG OUT AT ONCE BEAR CHIEF
IN A SMALL HUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST LIVED A MAN HIS WIFE THREE SONS AND A DAUGHTER FOR SOME REASON ALL THE ANIMALS SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER HABOGI LED UP A BEAUTIFUL HORSE FROM A FIELD WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT TO GRAZE AND BADE HELGA JUMP UP ON ITS SPLENDID SADDLE ALL EMBROIDERED IN SCARLET AND GOLD
SO THAT THEY WOULD GO ON ALL FOURS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND STOOPING OVER A SPRING OF WATER HE DIPPED A HANDFUL OF MOSS IN IT AND RUBBED IT OVER THE ARMS AND LEGS OF THE BOYS IN AN INSTANT THE TRANSFORMATION TOOK PLACE
SO WAS MINE TILL MY FATHER SMASHED A PAILFUL OF CRANBERRIES AND RUBBED MY EYES WITH THEM REPLIED THE WOLVERINE BUT IF YOU LIKE TO GO AND GATHER SOME OF THE BERRIES
ANSWERED THE BEAR NOW CLIMBING DOWN ALTOGETHER YOU MUST HAVE WONDERFULLY GOOD EYES I WISH I HAD BUT MY SIGHT IS VERY SHORT
FRIGHTENED THOUGH THEY WERE THEY DID NOT FORGET TO BEG THE LIGHTNING TO TAKE OFF THE WOLVERINE'S COAT AND TO FREE HIS LEGS BUT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO HURT HIM
AND THEN THE THONG OF HIS SNOW SHOES BROKE AND HE HAD TO STOP AND MEND IT SO THAT THE BEAR AND THE DOG GOT SO FAR AHEAD THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE BARKING WHEN THE STRAP WAS FIRM AGAIN
SO THE LIGHTNING DISAPPEARED INTO THE CLOUD FOR A MOMENT TO GATHER UP FRESH STRENGTH AND THEN CAME RUSHING DOWN RIGHT UPON THE ROCK WHICH IT SENT FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND TOOK
AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS TILL HE SAW BEARS SITTING ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM HOLDING A COUNCIL THE ANIMAL HE HAD BEEN CHASING SANK
THAT I EXPECT IT TO BURST EVERY TIME I BREATHE I KNEW YOU WERE STUPID BUT I DID NOT THINK YOU WERE AS STUPID AS THAT AND GIVING THE POOR FROG A BLOW ON HER HEAD WHICH KNOCKED HER STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER
AND AS THE YOUNGEST PLUCKED A HANDFUL OF WET MOSS THE TWO OTHERS SNIFFED AT IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THEN THE BEARSKIN FELL AWAY FROM THEM AND THEY STOOD UPRIGHT ONCE MORE HOW
BY THAT TIME THE FEAST WILL BE READY HELGA HAD SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE RIDE HOME APPEARED VERY SHORT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE HER AS THEY DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT SO UGLY AND CROSS LOOKING A MAN AS HABOGI
HELGA'S EYES SEEMED ALWAYS TURNED ANOTHER WAY AT LENGTH THE TWO ELDER SISTERS MADE THEIR CHOICE FROM OUT OF THE SIGURDS AND THE SIGMUNDS AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT BOTH WEDDINGS SHOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE SAME TIME
THE GIRL HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A NAME AND DID NOT LIKE IT SO SHE DETERMINED TO PAY NO ATTENTION BUT
AS SOON AS THE FIRE HAD BURNT ITSELF OUT THE LITTLE HUNTER ENTERED WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE FIRST THING HE SAW WAS HIS TWO BROTHERS HALF BEAR HALF BOY
AND THAT VERY SOON THEY WOULD BE THINKING OF MARRIAGE HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME IS TO BE SAID THE FATHER LAUGHINGLY TO HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER ONE EVENING WHEN THEY WERE ALL SITTING AT THE DOOR OF THEIR COTTAGE
AS HE COULD NOT CLIMB TREES LIKE THE BEAR SO HE FOLLOWED AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE SHRIEKING AS LOUD AS HE COULD COME DOWN SISTER OUR FATHER HAS SENT ME TO LOOK FOR YOU
AND IS TO BE YOURS SAID HABOGI AS HE JUMPED DOWN AND HELD OUT HIS ARMS TO LIFT HELGA FROM THE HORSE THE GIRL'S HEART SANK A LITTLE
OH HELP US HELP US CRIED THEY STANDING ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS THEY SPOKE
GIVING OUT SUCH TERRIFIC CLAPS OF THUNDER THAT THE WOLVES AND THE FOXES AND ALL THE OTHER CREATURES RAN HELTER SKELTER IN ALL DIRECTIONS
OH YOU MUSTN'T MIND A LITTLE PAIN SAID THE WOLVERINE IT WILL SOON BE OVER AND THEN YOU WILL SEE ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU HAVE NEVER DREAMT OF THE BEAR SANK DOWN WITH A GROAN
AND HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AND HUNT FOR MORE BESIDES HE WISHED TO SEEK FOR HIS PARENTS THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT LIKE BEING LEFT ALONE IN THE HUT AND CRIED BITTERLY
AND FOOD GREW VERY SCARCE SO ONE MORNING AFTER A NIGHT OF SNOW WHEN THE TRACKS OF BEASTS MIGHT BE EASILY SEEN THE THREE BOYS STARTED OFF TO HUNT
WHILE HIS BROTHER WHO HAD HURT HIS FOOT WAS STILL FAR BEHIND AS HE RAN UP THE MOUNTAIN OPENED TO ADMIT THE BEAR AND THE BOY WHO WAS CLOSE ON HIS HEELS RUSHED IN AFTER HIM
THE BEAR CHIEF KNEW A GOOD DEAL OF MAGIC AND HE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT THE LITTLE BOY WAS FOLLOWING THE TRAIL AND HE SENT A VERY SMALL BUT CLEVER BEAR SERVANT TO WAIT FOR HIM IN THE BUSHES AND TO TRY TO TEMPT HIM
I AM READY NOW SAID THE WOLVERINE AFTER A BIT JUST AT FIRST YOU WILL FIND THAT THE BERRIES MAKE YOUR EYES SMART BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO MOVE OR THE JUICE
THEN MEDEA DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE IT AND BEGAN TO CHANT HER MAGIC SONG AS SHE SANG THE COILS AROUND THE TREE GREW SLACK LIKE A DARK NOISELESS WAVE THE SERPENT SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND
OUT OF THAT LAIR WHICH WAS UNDERGROUND SMOKE AND FIRE BELCHED HE SET HIS FEET FIRMLY UPON THE GROUND AND HE HELD HIS SHIELD BEFORE HIM HE AWAITED THE ONSET OF THE BULLS
THAT WOULD HAVE HIM BE WATCHFUL OF THE TREACHERY OF HIS OWN OFFSPRING THIS PROPHECY WAS BEING FULFILLED BY THE CHILDREN OF CHALCIOPE HE FEARED TOO THAT HIS DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD AIDED THE STRANGERS
OF WHOM ELSE COULD IT BE THEN FOR THAT POOR FELLOW WAS WRONGLY ENOUGH THE OBJECT OF YOUR JEALOUSY AND I THOUGHT MY WIFE MADAME HAS ALREADY REPLACED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM PHILIP WHAT ARE YOU SAYING YOU ARE SPEAKING VERY HEEDLESSLY
AS BUCKINGHAM WAS AND I SHALL ASK THE KING UNLESS UNLESS WHAT UNLESS YOU MY DEAR MOTHER WHO ARE SO CLEVER AND SO KIND WILL EXECUTE THE COMMISSION YOURSELF I WILL NOT DO IT PHILIP WHAT MADAME
LISTEN PHILIP I AM NOT DISPOSED TO PAY PEOPLE ILL COMPLIMENTS EVERY DAY I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER YOUNG PEOPLE BUT I CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WITHOUT RUNNING THE CHANCES OF LOSING IT ALTOGETHER
AND HIS FACE WHICH WAS RADIANT AS THE MORNING I SUPPOSE MY BROTHER IS KEPT A LITTLE AT A DISTANCE SAID THE KING FIRE AND WATER CANNOT BE MORE OPPOSITE THAT WILL DO
VERY WELL HE SAID IN A CONCENTRATED TONE OF VOICE THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH I AM RESPECTED IN MY OWN HOUSE MONSEIGNEUR MONSEIGNEUR
BECAUSE SPANISH WOMEN ARE WORTH MORE THAN ENGLISH WOMEN AT LEAST EXPLAIN YOURSELF SINCE YOUR MARRIAGE YOU HAVE NOT I BELIEVE HAD A SINGLE REPROACH TO MAKE AGAINST THE QUEEN CERTAINLY NOT
AND YOU TOO HAVE BEEN MARRIED SOME TIME YOUR BROTHER ON THE CONTRARY HAS BEEN MARRIED BUT A FORTNIGHT WELL HE IS NOW FINDING FAULT WITH MADAME A SECOND TIME WHAT BUCKINGHAM STILL NO ANOTHER WHO
THAT YOU WILL PREVENT MADAME FROM BEING A COQUETTE AND GUICHE FROM BEING AMIABLE IS THAT ALL MY BROTHER HAS AN EXALTED IDEA OF SOVEREIGN POWER TO REFORM A MAN NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT REFORMING A WOMAN HOW WILL YOU SET ABOUT IT
AND THE SAME AIR OF ALLURING SEDUCTIVENESS MONTALAIS STOOD BY ADMIRINGLY LA VALLIERE SEATED IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM LOOKED ON THOUGHTFULLY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT WHICH THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCE PRODUCED UPON THIS GLEEFUL COMPANY
UPON WHAT UPON WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE OH MONSEIGNEUR IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER IT IS ABOMINABLE I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS MANNER HOW MISERABLE ALL THIS IS SAID THE CHEVALIER
STRIKING THE BRAZEN KNEES OF THE BULL SUDDENLY WITH HIS FOOT HE FORCED HIM DOWN THEN HE SMOTE THE OTHER BULL AS IT RUSHED UPON HIM AND IT TOO HE FORCED DOWN UPON ITS KNEES CASTOR AND POLYDEUCES HELD THE YOKE TO HIM
HE WOULD CONSPIRE AGAINST YOU AS YOUR UNCLE DID AGAINST YOUR FATHER NO PHILIP HAS TOO MUCH AFFECTION FOR ME FOR THAT AND I ON MY SIDE HAVE TOO GREAT A REGARD FOR HIM WE SHALL LIVE TOGETHER ON VERY GOOD TERMS BUT WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REQUEST
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO CONCEAL ONESELF FOR THE PURPOSES OF DANCING AND TO FEIGN INDISPOSITION IN ORDER TO DINE TETE A TETE NO NO MONSEIGNEUR YES YES EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE EXCITING HIMSELF LIKE A SELF WILLED CHILD
WHENEVER YOU INTEND TO AMUSE YOURSELVES HERE INVITE ME I AM A PRINCE UNFORTUNATELY VERY MUCH NEGLECTED GUICHE HAD NOW RECOVERED HIS SELF POSSESSION AND WITH THE SPIRITED BOLDNESS WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HIM AND SAT SO WELL UPON HIM HE SAID
MEDEA WAS BESIDE HIM AND THEY WENT SWIFTLY ON THEY CAME TO THE RIVER AND DOWN TO THE PLACE WHERE THE ARGO WAS MOORED THE HEROES WHO WERE ABOARD STARTED UP ASTONISHED TO SEE THE FLEECE THAT SHONE AS WITH THE LIGHTNING OF ZEUS
MONSIEUR THEN APPROACHED THEM SAYING IN A HOARSE TONE OF VOICE I AM DELIGHTED I CAME HERE EXPECTING TO FIND YOU ILL AND LOW SPIRITED AND I FIND YOU ABANDONING YOURSELF TO NEW AMUSEMENTS REALLY IT IS MOST FORTUNATE
BUT MADAME IS NOT A COQUETTE AT HEART THAT MAY BE BUT YOUR BROTHER IS EXCESSIVELY ANGRY ABOUT IT WHAT DOES HE WANT
IT IS THE HOUR HE USUALLY PAYS ME A VISIT EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO HIM YOURSELF
BUT AS JEALOUSY IS THE CASE I PROMISE NOTHING IT IS JUST THE SAME AS IF YOUR MAJESTY WERE TO DESIRE ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE AND SENT ME AWAY UNHEARD FAR FROM IT YOU ARE MY SON I OWE YOU A MOTHER'S INDULGENCE OH SAY WHAT YOU THINK
IS MADAME IN HER OWN APARTMENT I BELIEVE SO WHAT IS MY STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES TO CONSIST OF IN A FEW WORDS OF THE FOLLOWING MUSIC UNINTERRUPTEDLY GUICHE'S ASSIDUITY
WHEN SHE SAID THESE WORDS ALL JASON'S BEING BECAME TAUT LIKE THE STRING OF A BOW IT WAS THEN THE HOUR WHEN HUNTSMEN CAST SLEEP FROM THEIR EYES HUNTSMEN WHO NEVER SLEEP AWAY THE END OF THE NIGHT
WITH A WORD TO GUICHE WHO IS A CLEVER FELLOW I WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONVINCE HIM BUT MADAME THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT A WORD WILL NOT BE ENOUGH I WILL COMPOSE A HOMILY AND READ IT TO HER THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST
THEY CAME CLANGING UP WITH LOUD BELLOWING BREATHING OUT FIRE THEY LOWERED THEIR HEADS AND WITH MIGHTY IRON TIPPED HORNS THEY CAME TO GORE AND TRAMPLE HIM MEDEA'S CHARM HAD MADE HIM STRONG
IF YOU WISH TO DINE WITHOUT ME YOU HAVE YOUR LADIES WHEN I DINE ALONE I HAVE MY GENTLEMEN DO NOT STRIP ME OF EVERYTHING MADAME FELT THE REPROACH AND THE LESSON AND THE COLOR RUSHED TO HER FACE MONSIEUR SHE REPLIED
THESE YOUNG WOMEN EASILY TAKE OFFENSE TO REPROACH THEM FOR AN ERROR THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED IS SOMETIMES ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO TELLING THEM THEY MIGHT BE GUILTY OF EVEN WORSE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD BUT WAIT A MINUTE DO NOT FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE JUST THIS MOMENT SAID
WITH HIS LONG SPEAR HE DROVE THE BULLS BEFORE HIM AS WITH A GOAD TERRIBLY THEY RAGED FURIOUSLY THEY BREATHED OUT FIRE BESIDE JASON THESEUS WENT HOLDING THE HELMET THAT HELD THE DRAGON'S TEETH
HOLDING IN HIS HAND HIS BRONZE TOPPED SPEAR HE WOULD HAVE THEM ATTACK THE STRANGERS AND BURN THE ARGO HE WOULD HAVE THE SONS OF PHRIXUS SLAIN FOR BRINGING THEM TO AEA THERE WAS A PROPHECY HE DECLARED
MURMURED THE CHEVALIER IN THE DUKE'S EAR IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO CALM HIM COME REPLIED THE PRINCE AS HIS ONLY ANSWER TO THE REMARK HURRYING HIM AWAY AND TURNING ROUND WITH SO HASTY A MOVEMENT THAT HE ALMOST RAN AGAINST MADAME
THAT IS A VIOLENT MEASURE TO RESORT TO DO NOT LAUGH HE IS EXTREMELY IRRITATED THINK OF WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE GUICHE CERTAINLY OF IF YOUR BROTHER HEARD YOU
THEN HE SAW SPEARS AND SHIELDS AND HELMETS RISING UP OUT OF THE EARTH THEN ARMED WARRIORS SPRANG UP A FIERCE BATTLE CRY UPON THEIR LIPS JASON REMEMBERED THE COUNSEL OF MEDEA
YES BUT SERIOUSNESS IS NOT UNBECOMING IN PREACHERS AND THE MUSIC OF THE BALLET WOULD DROWN HALF MY ARGUMENTS BESIDES THE OBJECT IS TO PREVENT ANY VIOLENT MEASURES ON MY BROTHER'S PART SO THAT A LITTLE PRECIPITATION MAY BE ADVISABLE
AND HE ADDRESSED HER IN A VIVACIOUS TONE HIMSELF ANNE OF AUSTRIA TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND IN A VOICE FULL OF PLAYFULNESS SAID DO YOU KNOW SIRE THAT I AM PROUD OF BEING A SPANISH WOMAN WHY MADAME
NO NO MADAME HAS SO MANAGED MATTERS THAT I AM STILL JEALOUS OF WHOM IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS IT POSSIBLE YOU HAVE NOT REMARKED IT
WHAT YOU DID FOR THE OTHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR THIS ONE THE PRINCE BOWED SLIGHTLY ANNOYED IF I GIVE YOU FACTS HE SAID WILL YOU BELIEVE ME IF IT REGARDED ANYTHING ELSE BUT JEALOUSY I WOULD BELIEVE YOU WITHOUT YOUR BRINGING FACTS FORWARD
ANNE OF AUSTRIA FELT THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS NOW COMPLETE PEACE RESTORED TO HER FAMILY A NATION DELIGHTED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG MONARCH WHO HAD SHOWN AN APTITUDE FOR AFFAIRS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE REVENUES OF THE STATE INCREASED EXTERNAL PEACE ASSURED
AND THE FURROWS RAN WITH THEIR DARK BLOOD AS CHANNELS RUN WITH WATER IN SPRINGTIME THE ARGONAUTS SHOUTED LOUDLY FOR JASON'S VICTORY
DAY FADED AND JASON'S CONTEST WAS ENDED
I WILL HAVE HIM DROWNED IN MY FISH POND THE VERY NEXT TIME I FIND HIM IN MY APARTMENTS AGAIN HAVING LAUNCHED THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THE PRINCE EXPECTED HIS MOTHER WOULD BE FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER SENSES BUT THE QUEEN WAS UNMOVED DO SO SHE SAID
AS YET THE FURROWS WERE FREE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN JASON WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER AND FILLED HIS HELMET FULL OF WATER AND DRANK DEEPLY AND HIS KNEES THAT WERE STIFFENED WITH THE PLOWING HE BENT UNTIL THEY WERE MADE SUPPLE AGAIN
THE CHEVALIER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS OWN APARTMENT WHERE THE PRINCE HAD NO SOONER SEATED HIMSELF THAN HE GAVE FREE VENT TO HIS FURY THE CHEVALIER RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE CEILING JOINED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAID NOT A WORD GIVE ME YOUR OPINION EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE
SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN SIT IN THIS CHAMBER AND TALK TO HER HANDMAIDENS AND BE WITH CHALCIOPE HER SISTER FOREVER AFTERWARD SHE WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS MEDEA WEPT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS
OH I WILL USE THE UTMOST DILIGENCE THERE IS A REPETITION OF THE BALLET THIS AFTERNOON YOU WILL READ HER A LECTURE WHILE YOU ARE DANCING YES MADAME YOU PROMISE TO CONVERT HER
THEN JASON SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE A CLOUD FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN IT HUNG FROM A GREAT OAK TREE
MEDEA'S CHARM HAD MADE HIS SHIELD IMPREGNABLE THE RUSH OF THE BULLS DID NOT OVERTHROW HIM HIS COMRADES SHOUTED TO SEE HIM STANDING FIRMLY THERE AND IN WONDER THE COLCHIANS GAZED UPON HIM
IF THEY WERE DOING ANY HARM THEY WOULD HIDE THEMSELVES VERY GOOD EXCLAIMED THE DUKE I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY THAT
JASON CARRYING HIS SHIELD AND SPEAR WENT BEFORE THE KING FROM THE KING'S HAND HE TOOK THE GLEAMING HELMET THAT HELD THE DRAGON'S TEETH THIS HE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THESEUS WHO WENT WITH HIM
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO PROMISE A TRANQUIL FUTURE HER THOUGHTS RECURRED NOW AND THEN TO THE POOR YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHOM SHE HAD RECEIVED AS A MOTHER AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY AS A HARD HEARTED STEP MOTHER AND SHE SIGHED AS SHE THOUGHT OF HIM
OH NO HE MUTTERED SOME IMPERTINENT REMARK OR ANOTHER WELL WHAT IS YOUR OPINION PHILIP
THEN WITH THE SPEAR AND SHIELD IN HIS HANDS WITH HIS SWORD GIRT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH HIS MANTLE STRIPPED OFF
HE SLEW SOME THAT HAD RISEN OUT OF THE EARTH ONLY AS FAR AS THE SHOULDERS HE SLEW OTHERS WHOSE FEET WERE STILL IN THE EARTH HE SLEW OTHERS WHO WERE READY TO SPRING UPON HIM SOON ALL THE EARTH BORN MEN WERE SLAIN
THE EARTH BORN MEN AS FAST AS THEY AROSE WENT DOWN BEFORE THE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BRETHREN
I WISH TO SPEAK OF MADAME YOUR WIFE YES MADAME I SUPPOSE THAT SILLY FELLOW BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN WRITING A FAREWELL LETTER TO HER OH YES MADAME OF COURSE IT IS A QUESTION OF BUCKINGHAM

SHE WAS ASKING HERSELF IF THE NUNS AT THE OLD MOATED HOUSE EVER OPENED THEIR DOORS TO WOMEN WHOSE ONE CLAIM ON THEIR COMMON CHRISTIANITY WAS THE CLAIM TO BE PITIED WHEN SHE HEARD LINLEY'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING THE DOOR
BUT I HAVE NOT YET LOST FAITH IN HUMANITY IF I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AGAIN STILL WE MAY GLEAN HEALTH AND CONTENT IF NOT WORLDLY PROFIT I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE DISHONEST SCHEMERS IN THE WORLD WHO SET TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY
THE MOUNTAINS EVER CALL TO THEIR CHILDREN MURMURED MISSUS BLAYLOCK I FEEL THAT LIFE WILL TAKE ON THE ROSY HUE OF HOPE AGAIN IN AMONG THESE BEAUTIFUL HILLS PEYTON A LITTLE TASTE OF THE CURRANT WINE IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD
AN OVERPOWERING IMPATIENCE TO MAKE THE SPEEDIEST AND COMPLETEST ATONEMENT POSSESSED HER MUST SHE WAIT TILL HERBERT LINLEY NO LONGER CONCEALED THAT HE WAS WEARY OF HER AND CAST HER OFF NO
I CONSIDER THE PURCHASE A MOST FORTUITOUS ONE IT IS MY INTENTION TO ERECT A SMALL BUILDING UPON IT AT ONCE AND OPEN A MODEST BOOK AND STATIONERY STORE DURING PAST YEARS I HAVE MET WITH MANY PECUNIARY REVERSES
THE COOLOOSA RIVER WINDS THROUGH A RANGE OF SMALL MOUNTAINS PASSES OKOCHEE AND THEN BLENDS ITS WATERS TRIPPINGLY AS FALL THE MELLIFLUOUS INDIAN SYLLABLES WITH THE CHATTAHOOCHEE OKOCHEE ROSE AS IT WERE FROM ITS SUNNY SEAT ON THE POST OFFICE STOOP
THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A PROMISE MADE MANY YEARS SINCE TO HIS WIFE YOU AND I WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG WHEN MY POOR MOTHER DIED BUT I THINK YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE LIKE THE REST OF HER FAMILY WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAVING REMINDED YOU OF THIS
IS THERE A BOOKSTORE IN TOWN ONE SAID THE LAWYER HENRY WILLIAMS'S GET THERE SAID MISTER BLOOM WE'RE GOING TO BUY IT HENRY WILLIAMS WAS BEHIND HIS COUNTER HIS STORE WAS A SMALL ONE CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF BOOKS STATIONERY AND FANCY RUBBISH
THERE IN COMFORTABLE STEAMER CHAIRS THEY SAT AND BEGAN TO PIECE TOGETHER THE RANDOM LINES THAT WERE TO FORM AN INTELLIGENT PARAGRAPH IN THE BIG HISTORY OF LITTLE EVENTS OUR HOME SIR SAID COLONEL BLAYLOCK
THE OPOSSUM SWUNG BY HIS TAIL OVER THE SITE OF THE EXPOSITION HALL AND THE OWL HOOTED A MELANCHOLY RECITATIVE TO HIS AUDIENCE OF YOUNG SQUIRRELS IN OPERA HOUSE SQUARE
THAT IS ONE PORTENT REASON FOR THE CHANGE WE ARE MAKING MY DEAR CAN YOU NOT RECALL THOSE LINES YOU WROTE ENTITLED I THINK THE GEORGIA HILLS' THE POEM THAT WAS SO EXTENSIVELY COPIED BY THE SOUTHERN PRESS AND PRAISED SO HIGHLY BY THE ATLANTA CRITICS
MISTER BLOOM CONDUCTED THEM TO A TWO STORY BUILDING ON A SHADY STREET THAT BORE THE LEGEND PINE TOP INN HERE HE TOOK HIS LEAVE RECEIVING THE CORDIAL THANKS OF THE TWO FOR HIS ATTENTIONS
THE PRICE OF LOTS RANGED FROM FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS POSITIVELY NO LOT WOULD BE PRICED HIGHER THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
HER OVERBURDENED HEART FOUND NO RELIEF IN TEARS
I MAY NEXT TELL YOU THAT SANDYSEAL PLACE WAS MY MOTHER'S PROPERTY IT FORMED PART OF HER MARRIAGE PORTION AND IT WAS SETTLED ON MY FATHER IF SHE DIED BEFORE HIM AND IF SHE LEFT NO FEMALE CHILD TO SURVIVE HER I AM HER ONLY CHILD
IF SHE HAD BEEN A FEW YEARS OLDER HERBERT LINLEY MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE SEEN HER A LIVING CREATURE BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO FOLLOW ANY TRAIN OF REPELLENT THOUGHT PERSISTENTLY TO ITS END
THE POOR DESERTED CREATURE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE HAD DISGRACED THEM THE GOOD SISTER OF CHARITY WON HER CONFIDENCE A RETREAT WHICH WOULD HIDE HER FROM THE WORLD AND DEVOTE HER TO RELIGION FOR THE REST OF HER DAYS
WHO WERE NOT IN THE SECRET WAS THE ONE FEELING IN COMMON WHICH HER FATHER'S CORRESPONDENTS PRESENTED IN MERCY TO HIS MEMORY SHE THREW THE LETTERS INTO THE EMPTY FIREPLACE AND DESTROYED THEM BY BURNING
THE COLONEL DREW FROM THE TAIL POCKET OF HIS COAT A SMALL SHAWL OF KNITTED SILK AND LAID IT SOLICITOUSLY ABOUT THE SHOULDERS OF THE LADY
WITH A PONDEROUS AGILITY HALF PROFESSIONAL AND HALF DIRECTED BY SOME RESURRECTED UNNAMED LONG FORGOTTEN SENTIMENT FORMED A DIVERSIFIED BUT ATTENTIVE COURT THE CURRANT WINE
HIS DARK EYES STILL FIERY UNDER THE HEAVY BLACK BROWS
MY IDEA IS TO INVEST IT IN THE FUNDS AND TO LET IT THRIVE AT INTEREST UNTIL I GROW OLDER AND RETIRE PERHAPS FROM SERVICE IN THE NAVY
SHE WAS STILL HANDSOME STILL A WOMAN TO BE ADMIRED WHILE SHE HELD HER PLACE IN THE WORLD AS HIGH AS EVER WHAT WAS THE PROSPECT BEFORE SYDNEY WESTERFIELD
WENT ROUND AND THEN J PINKNEY BEGAN TO HEAR SOMETHING OF HOLLY SPRINGS LIFE IT SEEMED FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THE BLAYLOCKS THAT THE SPRINGS WAS DECADENT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION HAD MOVED AWAY BUSINESS AND THE COLONEL WAS AN AUTHORITY ON BUSINESS HAD DWINDLED TO NOTHING
AND PERSUADED A CONTINGENT OF INDIGENT NATIVES TO OCCUPY THEM THEREBY ASSUMING THE ROLE OF POPULATION IN SUBSEQUENT PROSPECTUSES WHICH BECAME ACCORDINGLY MORE SEDUCTIVE AND REMUNERATIVE
THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
DEFINITIVENESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SHALL INSPIRE THE IDEA OF CULTURE OR CARE OR SUPERINTENDENCE ON THE PART OF INTELLIGENCES SUPERIOR YET AKIN TO HUMANITY
RIPE AND REAL THAN ALL THE NONSENSE OF THEIR STONE IDEAL IN LANDSCAPE ALONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITIC TRUE AND HAVING FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
THE POSSESSOR OF ANY APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS WITH RICHES MERELY SURPASSING THOSE OF ANY CITIZEN
FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
A DECREE FINALLY OBTAINED FORBIDDING ALL SIMILAR ACCUMULATIONS THIS ACT DID NOT PREVENT YOUNG ELLISON UPON HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTH DAY
AND THEN HE INSTANCED THE HIGH ECSTASIES OF THE FOX HUNTER HIS SECOND PRINCIPLE WAS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
TILL THEY CAME TO A FLOWERY ISLAND UPON A STILL BRIGHT SUMMER'S EVE AND AS THEY NEARED IT SLOWLY AND WEARILY THEY HEARD SWEET SONGS UPON THE SHORE BUT WHEN MEDEIA HEARD IT SHE STARTED AND CRIED BEWARE ALL HEROES
THEN OUT OF THE DEPTHS CAME THETIS PELEUS'S SILVER FOOTED BRIDE FOR LOVE OF HER GALLANT HUSBAND AND ALL HER NYMPHS AROUND HER AND THEY PLAYED LIKE SNOW WHITE DOLPHINS DIVING ON FROM WAVE TO WAVE BEFORE THE SHIP
AND SHE WILL ESCAPE IN HER DRAGON CAR OR IF NOT THUS SOME OTHER WAY FOR SHE HAS A THOUSAND PLANS AND WILES AND WHY RETURN HOME AT ALL BRAVE HEROES AND FACE THE LONG SEAS AGAIN AND THE BOSPHORUS AND THE STORMY EUXINE
AND THEY CAME AND STOOD OPPOSITE EACH OTHER BUT MEDEIA STAYED IN THE PALACE THEN ALCINOUS SPOKE HEROES OF THE COLCHI WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND ABOUT THIS LADY TO CARRY HER HOME WITH US THAT SHE MAY DIE A SHAMEFUL DEATH
FOR THEY WERE ASHAMED TO LEAVE HER SO ALONE BUT JASON SAID SHE IS DEARER TO ME THAN TO ANY OF YOU YET I WILL TRUST HER FREELY ON SHORE SHE HAS MORE PLOTS THAN WE CAN DREAM OF IN THE WINDINGS OF THAT FAIR AND CUNNING HEAD
WHILE SILVER SHOALS OF FISH CAME UP TO HEARKEN AND WHISPERED AS THEY BROKE THE SHINING CALM THE WIND OVERHEAD HUSHED HIS WHISTLING AS HE SHEPHERDED HIS CLOUDS TOWARD THE WEST AND THE CLOUDS STOOD IN MID BLUE
AND SAW SICILY THE THREE CORNERED ISLAND UNDER WHICH ENCELADUS THE GIANT LIES GROANING DAY AND NIGHT AND WHEN HE TURNS THE EARTH QUAKES AND HIS BREATH BURSTS OUT IN ROARING FLAMES FROM THE HIGHEST CONE OF A ETNA
MY MOTHER WARNED ME OF HER ERE WE SAILED AWAY FROM HELLAS SHE HAS SIX HEADS AND SIX LONG NECKS AND HIDES IN THAT DARK CLEFT AND FROM HER CAVE SHE FISHES FOR ALL THINGS WHICH PASS BY FOR SHARKS AND SEALS AND DOLPHINS
AND LYNCEUS THE QUICK EYED SAW HIM COMING WHILE HE WAS STILL MANY A MILE AWAY AND CRIED I SEE A HUNDRED SHIPS LIKE A FLOCK OF WHITE SWANS FAR IN THE EAST AND AT THAT THEY ROWED HARD LIKE HEROES
BUT IF WE RETURN WITHOUT HER WE MUST DIE THE DEATH SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS JASON THE A EOLID SAID ALCINOUS TURNING TO THE MINUAI I SAY SAID THE CUNNING JASON
AND OUT OF THE HEAVENS HE SENT A STORM AND SWEPT THE SHIP FAR FROM HER COURSE DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM DROVE HER AMID FOAM AND BLINDING MIST TILL THEY KNEW NO LONGER WHERE THEY WERE FOR THE SUN WAS BLOTTED FROM THE SKIES
AND ARE GOING TO OUR RUIN FOR I SEE MY COUNTRYMEN AMONG THE CROWD DARK EYED COLCHI IN STEEL MAIL SHIRTS SUCH AS THEY WEAR IN MY FATHER'S LAND IT IS TOO LATE TO TURN SAID JASON AND HE SPOKE TO THE MERCHANT KING
NO GUEST OF OURS SHALL FIGHT UPON OUR ISLAND AND IF YOU GO OUTSIDE THEY WILL OUTNUMBER YOU I WILL DO JUSTICE BETWEEN YOU FOR I KNOW AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT THEN HE TURNED TO HIS KINGS AND SAID
THAT SHE MAY DIE A DREADFUL DEATH BUT IF YOU RETURN WITHOUT HER YOU SHALL DIE BY THE SAME DEATH YOURSELVES SO THE ARGONAUTS ESCAPED FOR THAT TIME BUT FATHER ZEUS SAW THAT FOUL CRIME
AND THE MASTERS OF THE SEA AND WE ARE BUT POOR WANDERING MARINERS WORN OUT WITH THIRST AND TOIL GIVE US BUT FOOD AND WATER AND WE WILL GO ON OUR VOYAGE IN PEACE THEN THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND ANSWERED
AND SHOWED HER THE SECRET NAIL AND SHE DREW THE NAIL OUT GENTLY BUT SHE POURED NO ICHOR IN AND INSTEAD THE LIQUID FIRE SPOUTED FORTH LIKE A STREAM OF RED HOT IRON AND TALUS TRIED TO LEAP UP CRYING
SING LOUDER ORPHEUS SING A BOLDER STRAIN WAKE UP THESE HAPLESS SLUGGARDS OR NONE OF THEM WILL SEE THE LAND OF HELLAS MORE THEN ORPHEUS LIFTED HIS HARP AND CRASHED HIS CUNNING HAND ACROSS THE STRINGS
SO THEY LEFT THE WITCH MAIDEN ON THE SHORE AND SHE STOOD THERE IN HER BEAUTY ALL ALONE TILL THE GIANT STRODE BACK RED HOT FROM HEAD TO HEEL WHILE THE GRASS HISSED AND SMOKED BENEATH HIS TREAD
THE LAND OF MISTS AND STORMS THE WILD WIND CAME DOWN DARK AND ROARING AND CAUGHT THE SAIL AND STRAINED THE ROPES AND AWAY THEY DROVE TWELVE NIGHTS ON THE WIDE WILD WESTERN SEA THROUGH THE FOAM AND OVER THE ROLLERS
COMING DOWN TOWARD THE SHIP AND THEY TREMBLED WHEN THEY SAW HER FOR HER HAIR AND FACE AND ROBES SHONE LIKE FLAME AND SHE CAME AND LOOKED AT MEDEIA AND MEDEIA HID HER FACE BENEATH HER VEIL
AND WE HAVE LOST OUR TWO SWIFT COMRADES THE SONS OF THE NORTH WIND BUT DO NOT THINK US COWARDS IF YOU WISH TO TRY OUR STRENGTH WE WILL SHOOT AND BOX AND WRESTLE AGAINST ANY MEN ON EARTH AND ALCINOUS SMILED AND ANSWERED
AND SLOWLY THEY CREPT DOWN TOWARD HIM LIKE LEOPARDS WHO CREEP UPON THEIR PREY AND THEIR HANDS WERE LIKE THE TALONS OF EAGLES AS THEY STEPT ACROSS THE BONES OF THEIR VICTIMS TO ENJOY THEIR CRUEL FEAST
AND NOW THEY COULD SEE THE SIRENS ON ANTHEMOUSA THE FLOWERY ISLE THREE FAIR MAIDENS SITTING ON THE BEACH BENEATH A RED ROCK IN THE SETTING SUN AMONG BEDS OF CRIMSON POPPIES AND GOLDEN ASPHODEL
THEN MEDEIA HELD UP A FLASK OF CRYSTAL AND SAID HERE IS THE ICHOR OF YOUTH I AM MEDEIA THE ENCHANTRESS
THEY STRUCK BACK HER RAVENING HEADS AND FOUL SCYLLA WHINED AS A WHELP WHINES AT THE TOUCH OF THEIR GENTLE HANDS BUT SHE SHRANK INTO HER CAVE AFFRIGHTED FOR ALL BAD THINGS SHRINK FROM GOOD
AND DIED IN PEACE AND NOW HIS SON ALCINOUS RULES US
UNLESS YOU WILL CLING TO THE LAND AND SAIL SOUTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD FOREVER I SHALL WANDER BEYOND THE ATLANTIC TO THE OCEAN WHICH HAS NO SHORE THEN THEY BLEST THE MAGIC BOUGH AND SAILED SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LAND
NAY WE ARE HER DEBTORS STILL WITHOUT HER WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE WON THE FLEECE BUT MOST OF THEM BIT THEIR LIPS IN SILENCE
THE MINSTREL'S SONG HAS CHARMED YOU BUT I MUST REMEMBER WHAT IS RIGHT FOR SONGS CANNOT ALTER JUSTICE AND I MUST BE FAITHFUL TO MY NAME ALCINOUS I AM CALLED THE MAN OF STURDY SENSE AND ALCINOUS I WILL BE
AND FEASTING THERE ALL THE YEAR ROUND AND BOYS OF MOLTEN GOLD STOOD EACH ON A POLISHED ALTAR AND HELD TORCHES IN THEIR HANDS TO GIVE LIGHT ALL NIGHT TO THE GUESTS AND ROUND THE HOUSE SAT FIFTY MAID SERVANTS
THEN TELL ME HEROES ASKED ALCINOUS YOU WHO HAVE SAILED THE OCEAN ROUND AND SEEN THE MANNERS OF ALL NATIONS HAVE YOU SEEN SUCH DANCERS AS OURS HERE OR HEARD SUCH MUSIC AND SUCH SINGING
HAIL TO THE NOBLE ARGONAUTS WHO SAILED THE UNKNOWN SEAL THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD THEIR JOURNEY OVER THE SLUGGISH NORTHERN MAIN AND THROUGH THE SHORELESS OUTER OCEAN TO THE FAIRY ISLAND OF THE WEST
AND THEY DREAMED OF BRIGHT STILL GARDENS AND OF SLUMBERS UNDER MURMURING PINES TILL ALL THEIR TOIL SEEMED FOOLISHNESS AND THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR RENOWN NO MORE THEN ONE LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY AND CRIED
THEN THEY CAME BACK AGAIN INTO THE HALL WHILE THE MERCHANT KINGS ROSE UP TO DO THEM HONOUR AND EACH MAN SAID TO HIS NEIGHBOUR NO WONDER THAT THESE MEN WON FAME HOW THEY STAND NOW LIKE GIANTS OR TITANS OR IMMORTALS COME DOWN FROM OLYMPUS
THEN ALL THE HEROES WEPT ALOUD WHEN THEY HEARD THE SENTENCE OF THE OAK FOR THEY KNEW THAT A DARK JOURNEY LAY BEFORE THEM AND YEARS OF BITTER TOIL AND SOME UPBRAIDED THE DARK WITCH WOMAN AND SOME SAID
FOR SHE KILLED ABSYRTUS HER YOUNG BROTHER AND CAST HIM INTO THE SEA AND SAID ERE MY FATHER CAN TAKE UP HIS CORPSE AND BURY IT HE MUST WAIT LONG AND BE LEFT FAR BEHIND AND ALL THE HEROES SHUDDERED
BUT LYNCEUS THE LONG SIGHTED CALLED GAYLY FROM THE BOWS TAKE HEART AGAIN BRAVE SAILORS FOR I SEE A PINE CLAD ISLE AND THE HALLS OF THE KIND EARTH MOTHER
SLOWLY THEY SUNG AND SLEEPILY WITH SILVER VOICES MILD AND CLEAR WHICH STOLE OVER THE GOLDEN WATERS AND INTO THE HEARTS OF ALL THE HEROES IN SPITE OF ORPHEUS'S SONG
AND THE LIQUID FIRE RAN FROM HIS HEEL LIKE A STREAM OF LAVA TO THE SEA AND MEDEIA LAUGHED AND CALLED TO THE HEROES COME ASHORE AND WATER YOUR SHIP IN PEACE SO THEY CAME AND FOUND THE GIANT LYING DEAD
WHERE A FEW WILD GOATHERDS DWELL BUT WHENCE COME THESE NEW HARBOURS AND VAST WORKS OF POLISHED STONE BUT JASON SAID THEY CAN BE NO SAVAGE PEOPLE WE WILL GO IN AND TAKE OUR CHANCE
WHERE THE TITAN SWAM ACROSS UPON THE BULL AND THENCE INTO THE LAZY WATERS OF THE STILL MAEOTID LAKE
AND GIVE THEM CLOTHES AND THEY WERE GLAD WHEN THEY SAW THE WARM WATER FOR IT WAS LONG SINCE THEY HAD BATHED AND THEY WASHED OFF THE SEA SALT FROM THEIR LIMBS AND ANOINTED THEMSELVES FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH OIL AND COMBED OUT THEIR GOLDEN HAIR
AND WHEN ORPHEUS SAW IT HE GROANED AND STRUCK HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND LITTLE WILL IT HELP TO US HE CRIED TO ESCAPE THE JAWS OF THE WHIRLPOOL FOR IN THAT CAVE LIVES SCYLLA THE SEA HAG WITH A YOUNG WHELP'S VOICE
TO HURL HER INTO THE SEA AND ATONE FOR THE YOUNG BOY'S DEATH BUT THE MAGIC BOUGH SPOKE AGAIN LET HER LIVE TILL HER CRIMES ARE FULL VENGEANCE WAITS FOR HER SLOW AND SURE BUT SHE MUST LIVE FOR YOU NEED HER STILL
AND LISTENED DREAMING LIKE A FLOCK OF GOLDEN SHEEP AND AS THE HEROES LISTENED THE OARS FELL FROM THEIR HANDS AND THEIR HEADS DROOPED ON THEIR BREASTS AND THEY CLOSED THEIR HEAVY EYES
AND SOME CRIED HE HAS SPOKEN WELL AND SOME WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF ROVING WE WILL SAIL THE SEAS NO MORE AND THE CHIEF SAID AT LAST BE IT SO THEN A PLAGUE SHE HAS BEEN TO US AND A PLAGUE TO THE HOUSE OF HER FATHER
AS I AM ALSO AND HAVE SUNG ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH NOT SO WELL AS HE SING TO US THEN NOBLE STRANGER SAID ALCINOUS AND WE WILL GIVE YOU PRECIOUS GIFTS
TURN FROM THEM FOR NO LIVING MAN CAN LAND THERE THERE IS NO HARBOUR ON THE COAST BUT STEEP WALLED CLIFFS ALL ROUND
WITH STRONG PALISADES ABOVE
FILLED FULL OF STATELY FRUIT TREES WITH OLIVES AND SWEET FIGS AND POMEGRANATES PEARS AND APPLES WHICH BORE THE WHOLE YEAR ROUND FOR THE RICH SOUTHWEST WIND FED THEM
BUT THE SHIPS CAME NEARER EVERY HOUR THEN MEDEIA THE DARK WITCH MAIDEN
AND HAUL THE SHIP WITH ROPES AND ROLLERS FOR MANY A WEARY DAY WHETHER OVER LAND OR MUD OR ICE I KNOW NOT
FOR THESE ARE THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS YOU MUST PASS CLOSE BY THEM FOR THERE IS NO OTHER CHANNEL BUT THOSE WHO LISTEN TO THAT SONG ARE LOST THEN ORPHEUS SPOKE THE KING OF ALL MINSTRELS LET THEM MATCH THEIR SONG AGAINST MINE
DO NOT SEND ME BACK TO MY FATHER TO DIE SOME DREADFUL DEATH BUT LET ME GO MY WAY AND BEAR MY BURDEN HAVE I NOT HAD ENOUGH OF PUNISHMENT AND SHAME WHO ARE YOU STRANGE MAIDEN AND WHAT IS THE MEANING OF YOUR PRAYER
AND HE SUNG THE SONG OF PERSEUS HOW THE GODS LED HIM OVER LAND AND SEA AND HOW HE SLEW THE LOATHLY GORGON AND WON HIMSELF A PEERLESS BRIDE AND HOW HE SITS NOW WITH THE GODS UPON OLYMPUS A SHINING STAR IN THE SKY
IN HIS FORGE IN A ETNA BENEATH THE EARTH AND CALLED HIM TALUS AND GAVE HIM TO MINOS FOR A SERVANT TO GUARD THE COAST OF CRETE THRICE A DAY HE WALKS ROUND THE ISLAND AND NEVER STOPS TO SLEEP
ONE OF THOSE WHICH SPRANG FROM THE GORGON'S HEAD WHEN PERSEUS CARRIED IT ACROSS THE SANDS AT LAST THEY ROWED AWAY TOWARD THE NORTHWARD FOR MANY A WEARY DAY TILL THEIR WATER WAS SPENT AND THEIR FOOD EATEN
IMMORTAL WITH HIS IMMORTAL BRIDE AND HONOURED BY ALL MEN BELOW SO ORPHEUS SANG AND THE SIRENS ANSWERING EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GOLDEN SEA TILL ORPHEUS'S VOICE DROWNED THE SIRENS
MY DEAR MISS BRACE HE SAID IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT WE CAN BE SPEAKING OF THE SAME LADY I ASSURE YOU THAT LADY ESTELLE HEREFORD IS KNOWN EVERYWHERE AS THE COLDEST AND PROUDEST OF WOMEN
AND WHEN SHE RETURNED HER GRANDMOTHER AND JULIE WERE IN THEIR PLACES HER FATHER HAD REMAINED STANDING UNTIL SHE ALSO WAS SEATED THEN BOWING HIS HEAD HE SAID THE SIMPLE GRACE OF GRATITUDE WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN OMITTED AT THAT TABLE
THAT JULIE LAUGHED MERRILY WHICH BROKE THE SPELL OH GERRY YOU DO LOOK SO FUNNY
THEN THE MAN HELD OUT A STRONG HAND AS HE SAID DAN BOY I HOPE MY GAL MADE IT SHE WOULD IF ANYONE COULD DAN SILENTLY RETURNED THE CLASP THEN HE MOUNTED THE HORSE
IN A LISTLESS VOICE SHE SAID AT ONCE FATHER
RISING HE STOOPED TO KISS HIS MOTHER'S FOREHEAD THEN LEFT THE ROOM GOING THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE GARDEN
THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON THEM AND ALL ITS LIGHT SEEMED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN A SUPERB DIAMOND THAT HE WORE ON HIS LEFT HAND NO MATTER WHERE SHE LOOKED HER EYES SEEMED TO BE DRAWN TO THAT STONE THE FIRE OF IT WAS DAZZLING THEN HER EYES WANDERED OVER THE WELL KNIT FIGURE WHAT A DIFFERENCE DRESS MADE
THE MEMORY OF THAT HOUR WAS NOT TO LEAVE THE GIRL WHILE LIFE WAS IN HER NOR WAS THE QUESTION IT RAISED EVER TO BE ANSWERED IN A FASHION SATISFACTORY TO HER INTELLIGENCE WHEN LATER SHE HEARD IT STATED WITH AUTHORITY
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THREE SHE WAS WILLING TO BE TREATED UNKINDLY MISS ABBOTT SHE SAID HOLDING OUT THE NEWSPAPER AND PRETENDING NOT TO NOTICE THE UNFRIENDLY EXPRESSION THERE IS NEWS IN HERE WHICH MAY BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO YOU
UTTERING FOREORDAINED OBSERVATIONS AND MAKING DICTATED RESPONSES ALL WITHOUT SUGGESTION OF SPONTANEITY
I WAS INDEED HAPPY TO HAVE HIM PRAISE GERALD AS HE DID
HAVE I BEEN GOOD TODAY THERE WERE SUDDEN TEARS IN THE FADING BLUE EYES AND A QUIVER IN THE CORNERS OF THE SWEET OLD MOUTH AS THE GRANDMOTHER REPLIED YES DAN YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I CAN TEAR MYSELF AWAY AGAIN SHE BLUSHED CRIMSON
SHE PAUSED FOR A LITTLE STARING AT THEM WITH DILATE EYES DARK IN A PALE RAPT FACE HER LIPS WERE PARTED BUT ONLY HER QUICKENED BREATHING WHISPERED PAST THEM SHE WAS TREMBLING MORE PAINFULLY THAN EVER BUT SHE SEEMED UNABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THE JEWELS
OR SHOULD SHE CAST HIM FROM HER AND BETRAY HIM ONE WORD ONLY ONE WORD WHISPERED LORD VIVIANNE BENDING HIS EVIL HANDSOME FACE OVER HER YOU THINK SUCH A QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED IN A MINUTE SHE SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
LOVE FOR KARSLAKE BURNED ON IN HER HEART BUT SHE KNEW NO SORT OF COMFORT IN SUCH CONFIDENCE
LORD VIVIANNE DREW ASIDE THE FALLEN BRANCH OF A SLENDER WILLOW THAT SHE MIGHT FIND ROOM TO SIT DOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR LOVERS HE REPEATED SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SMILE BUT WE ARE NOT LOVERS SHE SAID
I KNOW HOW USELESS IT IS EVEN TO ATTEMPT TO WIN EVEN ONE CORNER OF A PREOCCUPIED HEART WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO WIN ONE CORNER OF MINE SHE ASKED STEALING FROM UNDERNEATH HER LONG LASHES ONE SWEET SUBTLE GLANCE THAT WAS LIKE FIRE TO HIM
AND IN THE BOUDOIR SOFIA HAD SPENT
NEITHER DID THEIR MELANCHOLY YIELD TO THE DISTRACTION PROVIDED BY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH WAYS OF A WORLD
BUT IT IS SO COSTLY IT IS SO VERY VALUABLE
THIS ASSURANCE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM WHEN HE HEARD JANE SINGING A SNATCH OF A SCHOOL SONG IT SOUNDED LIKE A REQUIEM TO THE MAN IN THE GARDEN BELOW HE LEANED ON HIS HOE AS HE THOUGHT SELF REBUKINGLY
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE MEG AS BENEFACTRESS DAN AND THE CHILDREN HAD GONE ON A HIKE AND JANE BEING QUITE ALONE
SHE RESTED WITHOUT TOSSING WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER THEN SLEEP HAVING HELD HER FOR PRECISELY ONE HOUR BY THE CLOCK SOFIA OPENED HER EYES
THOUGH SHE HAD SLEPT LATE IN FACT TILL NOON AND SOMETHING AFTER
THEN HIS EYES FELL UPON THE DIAMOND RING SHINING AND SCINTILLATING IN THE SUN A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE HELD HER WHITE HAND IN HIS OWN AND LOOKED AT IT AS HE HELD IT UP TO THE LIGHT HOW FINE AND TRANSPARENT HE SAID I CAN SEE EVERY VEIN
HE LOOKED OVER THE TREES AND BEGAN TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE FLOWERS DORIS DID NOT MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT COME OUT TO LISTEN TO THE PRAISES OF FLOWERS SHE WOULD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES OVER THAT HER LORDLY LOVER HAD PRAISED HERSELF WHILE HE WAS TALKING SHE WAS THINKING OF MANY THINGS
NEVER BEFORE HAD IT BEEN USED FOR THE DAUGHTER WHO WAS SO LIKE THE MOTHER IN LOOKS ONLY THE MATTER IS DECIDED JANE HE INFORMED HER THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT YOU REQUIRE WILL BE FORTHCOMING HOWEVER I WISH YOU WOULD PLAN TO LEAVE TOMORROW
BERT BETHEL'S A TRUE FRIEND IF THERE EVER WAS ONE WON'T GERRY BE WILD WITH JOY BUT GOODNESS ME DANNY THAT MEANS MORE PACKING TO DO THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH IN JULIE'S TRUNK FOR THE THINGS GERALD WILL NEED AND I DO BELIEVE I'LL GO RIGHT UP AND PUT THEM IN WHILE THE BOY'S ASLEEP
WHEN SHE HAD SO OFTEN BEEN FRIGHTENED AND HAD TURNED TO HIM FOR PROTECTION PLEASE SEND THE CHILDREN AWAY I WANT TO TELL YOU ALONE GERALD NEEDED NO SECOND BIDDING COME ON JULIE HE CALLED LET'S GO AND PRACTICE ON OUR PINE TREE RIFLE RANGE HE WAS CARRYING THE SMALL GUN AND SO AWAY THEY RACED
HE TOLD US THE TAXES MUST BE PAID BUT I THOUGHT ANOTHER TWO WEEKS WOULD DO AS WELL AS NOW DAN DID NOT KNOW THE NEED OF HASTE MEG SEEING THAT THE GIRL
IT BROUGHT A FAINT HOPE THAT HER FATHER'S CABIN MIGHT YET BE SAVED DOWN THE STONE STEPS SHE WENT HOLDING OUT THE PAPERS
OH HOW I HOPE THAT YOU DID BUT THE MOUNTAIN GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD
SURE FOOTED AND WITH GREAT RAPIDITY JANE HEARD THE HALLOO WHEN HE PASSED BUT SHE DID NOT STIR
THE FIRE AND PASSION OF HIS WORDS SCARED HER YOUR FACE HAUNTS ME I SEE IT WHEREVER I GAZE HE CONTINUED YOUR VOICE HAUNTS ME I HEAR IT IN EVERY SOUND I WOULD FAIN WIN YOU IF I CAN FOR MY OWN
JULIE AND GERALD WIDE EYED AND WONDERING CROWDED NEAR DAN
SOFIA ONLY KNEW THAT FINDING HERSELF AWAKE SHE GOT UP DONNED NEGLIGEE AND SLIPPERS AND SET HER FEET UPON THE WAY APPOINTED WITHOUT ITS OCCURRING TO HER THAT THE WAY WAS STRANGE WITHOUT STOPPING TO QUESTION WHY OR WHETHER
NO SHE SAID THIS IS FINAL THEY NOTIFIED YOUR FATHER SOME TIME AGO JANE NODDED HOPELESSLY OH IF ONLY BROTHER WERE HERE BUT THE WORRY WOULD START HIM TO COUGHING AGAIN THE GIRL WHO SCORNED TEARS IN OTHERS BEGAN TO SOB HELPLESSLY
EAGERLY THE GIRL TORE IT OPEN THE OTHERS WATCHING HER WITH VARIED EMOTIONS ALTHOUGH JULIE'S WAS JUST EAGER CURIOSITY OHEE SHE SQUEALED
HE SAID AND NOT EVEN HIS WATCHFUL MOTHER NOTED A TRACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS VOICE IF I WERE YOU I WOULD PACK AT ONCE YOU WOULD BETTER GO OVER TO THE CITY IN THE MORNING AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO BUY A NEW SUMMER DRESS FOR I AM SURE THAT YOU MUST NEED ONE
NOR HAD SHE MET WITH MORE SUCCESS IN EFFORTS TO FIND A CAUSE FOR THIS DRAB HUMOUR UNLESS INDEED IT WERE SIMPLY THE FARTHEST SWING OF THE PENDULUM FROM YESTERDAY'S EMOTIONAL CRISES A LONG SWING OUT OF SUNLIT SPACES SWEPT BY THE BRAVE WINDS OF YOUNG ROMANCE INTO A GLOOMY ZONE OF BROODING TORPOR
WAITING FOR WHAT SOFIA COULD NOT GUESS SHE WENT TO BED PRESENTLY HOPING ONLY TO FIND SURCEASE OF BOREDOM
I HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR THE OTHER THREE CHILDREN BUT SOMEHOW THEY DIDN'T SPOIL THE COMFORT OF THAT REALIZATION WAS SO GREAT THAT THE FATHER SOON RETURNED TO HIS SELF IMPOSED TASK AND AN HOUR LATER WHEN DAN APPEARED HE TOLD THE BOY JANE'S DECISION SAYING
BUT MISTER ABBOTT WAS MISTAKEN A MESSENGER BOY STOOD ON THE PORCH
IT IS FOR YOU I REMAINED NEVER MIND LADY ESTELLE WE WILL NOT WASTE THE SUNNY HOURS OF THIS LOVELY MORNING TALKING ABOUT HER YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME YET IF YOU PREFER THIS COUNTRY ADMIRER OF YOURS TO ALL THE WORLD IF YOU DO THERE REMAINS FOR ME NOTHING EXCEPT TO TAKE UP MY HAT AND GO
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS ON THAT PRETTY WHITE HAND OF YOURS HE SAID LAUGHINGLY AND AS HE SPOKE HE DREW THE RING ON HER FINGER IT SHONE AND GLANCED LIKE FIRE THE SUNBEAMS SEEMED TO CONCENTRATE THEMSELVES ON IT AND CERTAINLY THE BEAUTIFUL WHITE HAND LOOKED THE LOVELIER FOR THE RING
HERS FOR THE TAKING THEN WITHOUT WARNING A TREMENDOUS CONVULSION LAID HOLD ON HER BODY AND SOUL AND SHE WAS RACKED AND SHAKEN BY IT
THEREAFTER SILENCE NO SOUND IN THE BOUDOIR NONE FROM THE ROOM BEYOND BUT TO SOFIA THE HURRIED BEATING OF HER HEART REVERBERATED ON THE STILLNESS LIKE THE ROLLING OF A DRUM WITHOUT CLEAR APPRECIATION OF HOW SHE HAD GOT THERE
LIFTING A TEAR STAINED FACE TO THE GIRL WHO WAS WATCHING HER TROUBLED AND THOUGHTFUL SHE IMPLORED OH ISN'T THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO IF I TELL THEM I WILL PAY IT IN TWO WEEKS WHEN MY BIRTHDAY MONEY COMES WON'T THAT DO AS WELL AS NOW MEG SHOOK HER HEAD
HIS EXPRESSION ASSURED THE OLD LADY THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF HIS ERRAND WHY DAN ABBOTT SHE EXCLAIMED WHATEVER STARTED YOU OFF IN THAT WAY TWASN'T ANYTHING I SAID WAS IT THE MAN SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A TELEGRAM
AND MORE THAN THAT CAPABLE OF BEING AND SHE
SHE AROSE AND WENT INDOORS TO LOCATE THE PAPERS THEIR FATHER HAD GIVEN DAN THESE BEING FASTENED WITH A RUBBER BAND INTO A NEAT PACKET SHE HELD CLOSELY WHILE SHE RAN OUT TO THE BROOK CALLING DAN'S NAME FRANTICALLY BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE
IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR INVESTMENTS THE MAN SAID STILL COLDLY FOR HE BELIEVED THE GIRL WAS CRYING BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP EVEN MORE THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED AND BE KEPT IN POVERTY FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SHE SAT UP HOWEVER WHEN HER FATHER SAID JANE DRY YOUR TEARS
THE CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMED SINGULAR
THEN SHE SAID MISS ABBOTT FIND YOUR PAPERS HAVE THEM READY FOR ME WHEN I RETURN I'LL TRY TO SAVE YOUR PLACE
MEANWHILE ON THE FRONT PORCH THE TWO WHO HAD LONG WATCHED AND WAITED WERE GETTING MOMENTARILY MORE ANXIOUS AND OFTEN
THAN TO BE PRAISED FOR SMARTNESS AND THAT'S HOW TIS DANNY AND I'M HAPPY AND PROUD THE DEAR LITTLE OLD LADY WIPED HER EYES WITH A CORNER OF HER APRON THEN SHE SMILED UP BRIGHTLY AND PRETENDED TO EAT THE MEAT PIE WHICH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING NEGLECTED
YOU ARE THE FIRST LADY WHOM I HAVE HEARD PLEAD GUILTY TO BAD TEMPER AS A RULE WOMEN PREFER MAKING THEMSELVES OUT TO BE ANGELIC I AM VERY FAR FROM THAT SAID DORIS FRANKLY NOR AM I NATURALLY BAD TEMPERED IT IS BECAUSE NOTHING IN MY LIFE PLEASES OR INTERESTS ME
SHE FOUND HERSELF STANDING OVER THE WRITING DESK AND DISCOVERED WHAT THE INDIFFERENT LIGHT HAD TILL NOW KEPT HIDDEN
HER ACTIONS NOW MORE THAN EVER RESEMBLED THOSE OF AN UNTHINKING PUPPET
THE PROUD GIRL BURST INTO SUDDEN TEARS FATHER HAS LOST EVERYTHING BUT OUR HOME IN THE EAST AND NOW
TO TURN HER VIVID ZEST IN LIFE TO ASHES IN HER MOUTH SO THAT NOTHING SEEMED TO MATTER ANY MORE THOUGHTS OF KARSLAKE AS HER LOVER
THEN SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HER SON INQUIRINGLY WILL IT BE QUITE FAIR TO MISTER PETERSON TO HAVE GERRY LEAVE HIS STORE WITHOUT GIVING NOTICE I'VE ATTENDED TO THAT MOTHER THE MAN REPLIED
SURCHARGED WITH UNSEIZABLE DISQUIET ITS ATMOSPHERE ELECTRICAL WITH FORMLESS APPREHENSIONS ITS SAD TWILIGHT SHOT WITH LURID GLEAMS NO SOONER GLIMPSED THAN GONE IN THIS STATE SOFIA'S SENSIBILITIES WERE LESS BENUMBED
MISTER PETERSON WAS SO PLEASED THAT HE ASKED GERALD ABOUT IT ONE DAY SAYING DON'T YOU LIKE CANDY LAD AND OUR BOY REPLIED INDEED I DO MISTER PETERSON I DON'T BUY IT BECAUSE I WANT TO SAVE ALL MY MONEY TO HELP DAD
HE LOOKED ENTREATINGLY AT HER I WONDER HE SAID IF YOU WILL BE ANGRY THIS WAS MY MOTHER'S RING AND I PRIZE IT MORE THAN I DO ANYTHING IN THE WIDE WORLD I AM AFRAID PROMISE ME YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY IT WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
I WANT TO BE ALONE WITHOUT WORRIES THAT I MAY DECIDE HOW BEST TO GO ABOUT EARNING WHAT I SHALL NEED TO FINISH PAYING THE DEBT THAT I STILL OWE TO THE POOR PEOPLE WHO TRUSTED ME OH FATHER FATHER JANE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER CHAIR AT THE TABLE AND PUT HER HEAD DOWN ON HER FOLDED ARMS
WITH ITS KEEN WONDER THAT SHE HAD CONTRIVED TO SURVIVE SUCH EXQUISITE TEDIUM SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE HAD MOVED THROUGHOUT LIKE AN AUTOMATON SWAYED BY A WILL OUTSIDE ITS OWN FUNCTIONING RATHER THAN LIVING PERFORMING APPOINTED BUSINESS EXECUTING PRESCRIBED GESTURES
AND LEAVE GERALD AT HOME HE'S BEEN WISHING AND WISHING AND WISHING HE COULD GO BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL DAD CAUSE HE WANTS TO STAY HOME AND EARN MONEY TO HELP TO THE LITTLE OLD LADY'S SURPRISE HER COMPANION SPRANG UP AS HE EXCLAIMED MOTHER I WON'T BE GONE LONG WAIT UP FOR ME
AND THE CRIME HE HAD WILLED HER TO COMMIT IN FINAL ANALYSIS NOT REPUGNANT TO HER INSTINCTS OR WAS IT SOME SECRET FACULTY OF THE SOUL TELEPATHY OR OF ITS KIN THAT ROUSED AND SENT HER TO KEEP HER RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY A RIDDLE NEVER TO BE READ
LORD CHARLES VIVIANNE WOULD NEVER HAVE TROUBLED HIMSELF TO HAVE WORN HIS MOTHER'S RING BUT EVEN HE BOLD AND ADVENTUROUS AS HE WAS THOUGHT SOME LITTLE PREAMBLE NECESSARY BEFORE HE OFFERED HER SO VALUABLE A GIFT
GERALD HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF HELPING HIMSELF AS HE WORKED AROUND THE STORE OF COURSE GERRY WOULDN'T THE OLD LADY REPLIED EMPHATICALLY FOR ISN'T HE YOUR SON DANIEL AND YOUR GRANDSON MOTHER THE MAN SMILINGLY RETURNED BUT WE MUST GET SOME SLEEP HE ADDED
BUT ABOVE ALL THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS HEART HE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A WARM GLOW OF ADMIRATION FOR A GIRL WHO WAS NOT HIS SISTER WHAT HE SAID WAS JANE DEAR QUIET YOURSELF WE CAN DO NOTHING BUT WAIT
OH BROTHER BROTHER IF ONLY THIS CABIN IS SAVED FOR DAD I WILL NEVER NEVER AGAIN BE SO VAIN AND SELFISH OH DAN TELL ME SAY THAT YOU THINK MEG WILL REACH THE COUNTY SEAT BEFORE FIVE THE LAD FOUND THAT HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH CONFLICTING EMOTIONS
HOW VAIN AND FOOLISH SHE HAD BEEN TO WANT THAT NECKLACE
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN JANE SAT ALMOST AS ONE STUNNED
SEIZING HIS HAT FROM THE HALL TREE HE LEFT THE HOUSE WELL NOW THAT'S CERTAINLY A CURIOUS CAPER THE OLD LADY THOUGHT
MORE THAN WORDS COULD HAVE DONE THAT SOMETHING OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE HAD OCCURRED DURING THEIR ABSENCE CATCHING HER IN HIS ARMS HE FELT HER BODY TREMBLE HE LED HER BACK TO THE PORCH BEFORE HE ASKED JANE TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED HAS THAT SLINKING COYOTE FRIGHTENED YOU
I NEVER EVEN TROUBLE TO LOCK THE THING
THEN HE HELD THE LITTLE HAND EVEN MORE TIGHTLY IN HIS OWN I AM HALF AFRAID HE SAID QUIETLY BUT I WISH THAT YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU THIS RING SHE LOOKED AT HIM SUDDENLY AND WITH A BURNING FLUSH ON HER FACE TO ME SHE SAID HESITATINGLY YES
MY FATE IN THE FUTURE IS FIXED NOTHING CAN ALTER IT YES HE SAID GENTLY THERE IS ONE THING THAT CAN ALTER IT AND ONLY ONE YOUR WILL AND MINE
THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR IN THE DARK EYES THAT WERE LIFTED OH WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO SHE IMPLORED HELPLESSLY
WHEN CHANCE OR FATE OR THE SMOOTH WORKING OUT OF MALICIOUS MORTAL MACHINATIONS
AND A LONG LONG WAIT THEY WERE DESTINED TO HAVE THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK MOVED SLOWLY TO FOUR THEN FIVE AND THEN SIX
IT FLEW DOWN FROM ITS CAGE AND PERCHING ON THE TABLE
AND KORAN READING HISTORY SYNTAX AND LEXICOGRAPHY ARCHERY SPEARPLAY AND HORSEMANSHIP AND WHAT NOT ELSE BEHOVETH THE SONS OF KINGS NOR WAS THERE
AFTER DIVING INTO THE DEEP FARED ON TILL THEY CAME TO SALIH'S PALACE
AND VIOLENT LITTLE OF WIT AND TYRANNICAL OF TEMPER GRUDGING HIS DAUGHTER TO EVERY SUITOR FOR ALL THE MONARCHS OF THE MAIN HAVE SOUGHT HER HAND BUT HE REJECTED THEM ALL NAY
AND WE ARE A FOLK OF HIGH SPIRIT AND SHOULD RETURN BROKEN HEARTED HEARING THESE WORDS SALIH ANSWERED O MY MOTHER WHAT IS TO DO FOR
AND THOU ART MASTER THEREOF AND I IMPOSE NOT ON THE KING A DIFFICULTY NOR AM I JINN DEMENTED THAT I SHOULD CRAVE OF THE KING
ALBEIT THE KING BE DEAD YET HATH HE LEFT BEHIND HIM AS SUCCESSOR THIS NOBLE AND PEERLESS YOUTH THE RENDING LION AND THE SHINING MOON THEREUPON THE GRANDEES AND NOTABLES OF THE EMPIRE
WITH AMBERGRIS ON PEARL TWO LINES AS TWERE WITH JET UPON AN APPLE LINE FOR LINE DEATH HARBOURS IN HIS LANGUID EYE AND SLAYS WITH EVERY GLANCE
FOR EAR OFT LOVETH ERE EYE SURVEY BUT JULNAR SAID SPEAK OUT AND BE BRIEF AND FEAR NOT O MY BROTHER SO HE SAID
AFTER CAPTURING THE KING AND KILLING HIS FOLK BUT FINDING HER NOT RETURNED TO HIS PALACE AND SAID TO HIS MOTHER
INDEED I FEAR TO TAKE THEE AND GO WITHOUT HER LEAVE LEST SHE BE WROTH WITH ME AND VERILY THE RIGHT WOULD BE ON HER SIDE FOR I SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF HER SEPARATION FROM US MOREOVER
AND THEY TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE KING WAS A PRISONER
WHEN THE TWO PARTIES CAME TO BLOWS SOME OF KING AL SAMANDAL'S PAGES FLED
LET US RETURN TO THY MOTHER AND TELL HER HOW THE CASE STANDETH AND CRAVE HER LEAVE THAT I MAY TAKE THEE WITH ME AND SEEK THE PRINCESS IN MARRIAGE OF HER SIRE AFTER WHICH WE WILL FAREWELL HER AND I AND THOU WILL RETURN
I DO MY ENDEAVOUR TO FURTHER THE DESIRE OF MY SISTER'S SON THOUGH IT RELIEVE ME OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I WAS THE CAUSE OF WHATSO HATH BETIDED AND EVEN AS I PLUNGED HIM INTO THE OCEAN OF HER LOVE SO WILL I GO ABOUT TO MARRY HIM TO HER

WHO SHALL SAVE ME FROM LOVE OF A LOVELY GAZELLE BRIGHTER BROWED THAN THE SUNSHINE MY BONNIBEL MY HEART ERST FREE FROM HER LOVE NOW BURNS WITH FIRE
FOR ONE OF THE SAGES SAITH AN THOU WOULDST BE COMPLIED WITH ASK THAT WHICH CAN BE READILY SUPPLIED
AND TAKING TWO BAGS FULL OF GEMS SUCH AS RUBIES AND BUGLES OF EMERALD NOBLE ORES AND ALL MANNER JEWELS GAVE THEM TO HIS SERVANTS TO CARRY AND SET OUT WITH HIS NEPHEW FOR THE PALACE OF AL SAMANDAL

CAME TO BLOWS WITH MY SIRE AND SLEW HIS TROOPS AND TOOK HIM PRISONER WITH SOME OF HIS MEN WHEREFORE I FLED FEARING FOR MY VERY LIFE PRESENTLY ADDING AND I WEET NOT WHAT FORTUNE HATH DONE WITH MY FATHER

NOR THAT OF MY SISTER AND MY NEPHEW AND BY ALLAH O KING OF THE AGE TIS NOT PLEASANT TO MY HEART TO PART FROM THEE BUT HOW SHALL WE DO SEEING THAT WE HAVE BEEN REARED IN THE SEA
SHE REPLIED WITH LOVE AND GLADNESS O MY DAUGHTER ASK NOT WHAT WE SUFFER BY REASON OF HIS LOSS AND ABSENCE THEN SHE SENT TO SEEK FOR HER GRANDSON WHILST JULNAR RETURNED TO HER KINGDOM
WITH THE KING STANDING BEFORE HIM SHE ROSE AND KISSING HIM GAVE HIM JOY OF THE SULTANATE AND WISHED HIM AND HIS SIRE LENGTH OF LIFE AND VICTORY OVER THEIR FOES HE SAT WITH HER AND RESTED
HE BEGAN TO RIDE OUT A HUNTING AND A CHASING AND TO GO ROUND ABOUT IN THE CITIES AND COUNTRIES UNDER HIS RULE PROCLAIMING SECURITY AND SATISFACTION AND DOING AFTER THE FASHION OF KINGS AND HE WAS UNIQUE
BEARING IT IN HIS TURN TILL THEY CAME TO THE VESTIBULE OF THE PALACE WHERE THE PRINCE ALIGHTED AND HIS FATHER AND THE EMIRS EMBRACED HIM AND SEATED HIM ON THE THRONE OF KINGSHIP WHILST THEY
SON OF QUEEN JULNAR AND HE ANSWERED YES O MY LADY THEN SHE MAY ALLAH CUT OFF MY FATHER AND GAR HIS KINGDOM CEASE FROM HIM
SO RECOUNT TO ME ALL ANENT HER AND FEAR NAUGHT FOR MY SON SLEEPETH QUOTH SALIH I FEAR LEST HE BE AWAKE AND THE POET SAITH I LOVED HIM SOON AS HIS PRAISE I HEARD
HOW DIDST THOU LEAVE THY MOTHER JULNAR HE REPLIED SHE IS WELL IN HEALTH AND FORTUNE AND SALUTETH THEE AND HER UNCLE'S DAUGHTERS THEN SALIH RELATED TO HIS MOTHER WHAT HAD OCCURRED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SISTER
IS WHOSO LEAVETH THE LIKE OF HIM THE RENDING LION AND THE SHINING MOON AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
BUT WHAT BRINGETH THEE TO US TELL ME THINE ERRAND THAT WE MAY FULFIL IT TO THEE WHEREUPON SALIH AROSE AND KISSING THE GROUND A SECOND TIME SAID O KING OF THE AGE MY ERRAND IS TO ALLAH
THE OLD KING FELL SICK AND HIS FLUTTERING HEART FOREBODE HIM OF TRANSLATION TO THE MANSION OF ETERNITY HIS SICKNESS GREW UPON HIM TILL HE WAS NIGH UPON DEATH WHEN HE CALLED HIS SON
WITH FURIOUS RAGE AND THEY BEHELD HIS EUNUCHS AND PAGES AND OFFICERS UNPREPARED WHEN THE KING SAW THEM ENTER DRAWN BRAND IN HAND HE CRIED OUT TO HIS PEOPLE SAYING
WAS RESOLVED TO GO WITH HIM WHETHER HIS MOTHER WOULD LET HIM OR NO HE DREW FROM HIS FINGER A SEAL RING WHEREON WERE GRAVEN CERTAIN OF THE NAMES OF ALLAH THE MOST HIGH AND GAVE IT TO HIM SAYING
WHEN HE DESCENDED FROM THE THRONE AND WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER JULNAR THE SEA BORN WITH THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AS HE WERE THE MOON
OUR MAN ALSO IS A KING AND THE SON OF A KING OR IF HE OBJECT TO US HER BEAUTY BEHOLD OUR MAN IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE OR AGAIN IF HE OBJECT TO US THE VASTNESS OF HIS DOMINION
LAY DOWN UNDER A SHADY TREE THINKING TO REST AND SLEEP BUT HE REMEMBERED HIS UNCLE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIDEN AND HER BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS AND SHED RAILING TEARS
A MISERABLE EXILE AND HAVE FLED FOR REFUGE TO THIS ISLAND BUT AN I DEVISE NOT AGAINST HIM SOME DEVICE TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM HIM HE WILL POSSESS HIMSELF OF ME AND TAKE HIS WILL OF ME
DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THIRD NIGHT
YES O MY LADY AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY NINTH NIGHT SHE RESUMED
HAPLY WILT THOU ACCEPT MY GIFT AND BY SHOWING FAVOUR TO ME HEAL MY HEART
SHE SAID IN HERSELF TWAS ON THIS MISERABLE GALLOWS BIRD'S ACCOUNT THEN THAT ALL THIS HATH BEFALLEN AND THAT MY FATHER HATH FALLEN PRISONER AND HIS CHAMBERLAINS AND SUITE HAVE BEEN SLAIN AND I HAVE BEEN DEPARTED FROM MY PALACE
IF HE COULD DESIRE A COMELIER THAN THOU OR AUGHT GOODLIER THAN THESE FAIR QUALITIES OF THINE BY ALLAH HE IS OF LITTLE WIT AND JUDGMENT PRESENTLY ADDING BUT O KING OF THE AGE PUNISH HIM NOT FOR THAT HE HATH DONE
HE MARVELLED WITH EXCEEDING MARVEL AT THIS STRANGE CHANCE AND THOUGHT DOUBTLESS I HAVE WON MY WISH BY THE CAPTURE OF HER SIRE THEN HE LOOKED AT JAUHARAH AND SAID TO HER COME DOWN O MY LADY
HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE PRINCESS JAUHARAH DAUGHTER OF AL SAMANDAL BY REPORT AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE TALE FROM BEGINNING TO END ADDING HE HATH NOT COME SAVE TO DEMAND HER IN WEDLOCK OF HER SIRE
WHEN THEY CAME THITHER HE SOUGHT AUDIENCE OF THE KING AND BEING ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE KISSED GROUND BEFORE HIM AND SALUTED HIM WITH THE GOODLIEST SALAM THE KING ROSE TO HIM
AND VIOLENT TEMPERED TO BOOT SO THEY DISMOUNTED AND BARING THEIR BLADES WENT IN TO THE KING AL SAMANDAL WHOM THEY FOUND SEATED UPON THE THRONE OF HIS KINGSHIP UNAWARE OF THEIR COMING AND ENRAGED AGAINST SALIH
AND THESE WHEN THEY SAW SALIH COME RUNNING OUT OF THE PALACE THEY HAVING BEEN SENT BY HIS MOTHER TO HIS SUCCOUR QUESTIONED HIM AND HE TOLD THEM WHAT WAS TO DO WHEREUPON THEY KNEW THAT THE KING WAS A FOOL
FOR I AM SLAIN FOR LOVE OF THEE AND THINE EYES HAVE CAPTIVATED ME ON MY ACCOUNT AND THINE ARE ALL THESE BROILS AND BATTLES
FOR I KNOW ALL THE DAMSELS OF THE SEA KINGS DAUGHTERS AND OTHERS AND IF I JUDGE HER WORTHY OF HIM I WILL DEMAND HER IN MARRIAGE FOR HIM OF HER FATHER THOUGH I SPEND ON HER WHATSO MY HAND POSSESSETH
ART THOU IN VERY SOOTH
AND RESUMED SALIH THE PIOUS IF WE STOOD ON OUR FACES IN THY SERVICE O KING OF THE AGE A THOUSAND YEARS YET
AND PLACING HIM IN A FINE CAGE HUNG HIM UP AFTER SETTING MEAT AND DRINK BY HIM WHEN THE KING CAME DOWN FROM THE DIVAN HE SAID TO THE EUNUCH WHERE IS THE BIRD BRING IT TO ME THAT I MAY LOOK UPON IT FOR BY ALLAH TIS BEAUTIFUL
WITH WHAT OBJECT DOST THOU GIFT ME WITH THIS GIFT TELL ME THY TALE AND ACQUAINT ME WITH THY REQUIREMENT AN ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT BE IN MY POWER I WILL STRAIGHTWAY ACCOMPLISH IT TO THEE
I WOULD KILL HIM ALLAH NEVER REQUITE HIM WITH GOOD HOW UNLUCKY WAS HIS COMING TO US FOR ALL THIS TROUBLE IS DUE TO HIS HARD HEADEDNESS BUT DO THOU O SLAVE GIRL BEAR HIM TO THE THIRSTY ISLAND
IS THAT THE SOVRAN SHOW FAVOUR TO ME AND HEAL MY HEART BY ACCEPTING MY PRESENT
AND ALL THE BYSTANDERS MARVELLED AND THE KING SAID TO HIS ATTENDANTS EUNUCHS AND MAMELUKES IN ALL MY LIFE I NEVER SAW A BIRD EAT AS DOTH THIS BIRD THEN HE SENT AN EUNUCH TO FETCH HIS WIFE THAT SHE MIGHT ENJOY LOOKING UPON THE BIRD
AT THE END OF WHICH SALIH AROSE AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIS BROTHER IN LAW WHO ASKED WHAT WANTEST THOU O SALIH HE ANSWERED O KING OF THE AGE INDEED
HE RODE FORTH THUS EVERY DAY TO THE TILTING GROUND RETURNING TO SIT AND JUDGE THE PEOPLE AND DO JUSTICE BETWEEN EARL AND CHURL AND THUS HE CONTINUED DOING A WHOLE YEAR
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOURTH NIGHT SHE PURSUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SALIH BROTHER OF JULNAR AND HER MOTHER AND COUSINS SAID TO HER
BUT NOW THAT WE SEE THEE TO BE UNITED WITH HER
WHEN KING AL SAMANDAL HEARD SALIH'S WORDS HE WAS WROTH WITH EXCEEDING WRATH HIS REASON WELL NIGH FLED AND HIS SOUL WAS LIKE TO DEPART HIS BODY FOR RAGE AND HE CRIED O
AND SHE ANSWERED SAYING O MY DAUGHTER OF A TRUTH HE CAME HITHER WITH HIS UNCLE WHO TOOK JACINTHS AND JEWELS AND CARRYING THEM TO KING AL SAMANDAL DEMANDED HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE FOR THY SON BUT HE CONSENTED NOT
THAT AN HE TAKE HER NOT TO WIFE HE WILL DIE OF LOVE FOR HER AND LONGING AND SALIH CONTINUED HE IS HANDSOMER AND GOODLIER THAN SHE HIS FATHER WAS KING OF ALL THE PERSIANS WHOSE KING HE NOW IS
BESIDES THREE HUNDRED BUGLES OF EMERALD AND OTHER THREE HUNDRED HOLLOW GEMS AS BIG AS OSTRICH EGGS WHOSE LIGHT DIMMED THAT OF SUN AND MOON QUOTH SALIH O KING OF THE AGE
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN QUEEN JULUAR RETURNED FROM HER MOTHER TO HER OWN REALM HER BREAST WAS STRAITENED AND SHE WAS IN ILL CASE
AND THE WHOLE COMPANY RODE AWAY IN THE DARKNESS DESPITE HIS RESOLUTION HARRY FELT A PANG WHEN THE LAST FIGURE DISAPPEARED OUR CURIOSITY BEIN GRATIFIED I THINK WE'D BETTER GO BACK TO SLEEP
AND THE SKIES WERE CUT DOWN THE CENTER BY BURNING STROKES OF LIGHTNING THE WIND WHIPPED THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER INTO WHITE FOAMY WAVES BUT HARRY HEARD AND BEHELD IT ALL WITH A CERTAIN PLEASURE
UNTIL HE SHOULD LEAVE HIM IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THAT HE HAD GIVEN HIM HIS SACRED PROMISE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT A POWERFUL PULL THE SIGHT OF BRECKINRIDGE MORGAN AND DUKE HAD GIVEN TO HARRY AND HE KNEW
AND DREW NEAR TO THE HILLS THE EYES OF JARVIS KINDLED
HIS SENSE OF COMFORT INCREASED AND THE REGULAR EVEN MUSICAL THRESH OF THE RAIN PROMOTED SLEEP WE WON'T BE WAKED UP TONIGHT BY PEOPLE CROSSIN THE RIVER THAT'S SHORE SAID JARVIS
SPEEDING AWAY IN ECHOES AMONG THE LOFTY PEAKS AND RIDGES THAT HAD NOW TURNED FROM HILLS INTO REAL MOUNTAINS THEY TOWERED FAR ABOVE THE STREAM AND EVERYWHERE
AND HESITATED BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN HE SPOKE IN A DECIDED WHISPER SINCE THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AN ARE GOIN ON THE SAME BUSINESS THAT YOU ARE
AND JARVIS AND HARRY WERE SOON ASLEEP AGAIN BUT THEY WERE UP AT DAWN AND AFTER A BRIEF BREAKFAST RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY ON THE RIVER GOING AT A GOOD PACE TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST
AND HE COULD NOT BREATHE HE AROSE OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD BY IT FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE THE FRESH AIR POURED IN JARVIS AWOKE AND CHUCKLED
HE SAID AN I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN AG'IN EM I ADMIT THEIR CLAIMS BEFORE THEY MAKE EM BUT MY TRUE LOVE IT'S THE MOUNTAINS AN MY MOUNTAIN HOME
AND WHEN NIGHT CAME THEY HAD LEFT THE LOWLANDS SEVERAL MILES BEHIND THEY TIED UP TO A GREAT BEECH GROWING ALMOST AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND MADE THEIR CAMP ON THE GROUND HARRY'S DEER
THEN HE REMEMBERED THE ROPE FERRY
SO LET THE STORM HOWL THEY BORE HIM AWAY WHEN THE DAY HAD FLED AND THE STORM WAS ROLLING HIGH AND THEY LAID HIM DOWN IN HIS LONELY BED
NOTHIN OF COURSE WOULD WAKE THAT LUNKHEAD
AN DON'T NEVER MAKE FOOLS O THEIRSELVES IT'S TIME WE WAS BACK IN OUR BLANKETS SLEEPIN SOUND CAUSE WE'VE GOT ANOTHER LONG DAY O HARD ROWIN BEFORE US IKE HAD NOT AWAKENED
AND BEFORE NIGHT HE WAS SINGING AGAIN AS I STRAYED FROM MY COT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY TO MUSE ON THE BEAUTIES OF JUNE NEATH A JESSAMINE SHADE
OH LISTEN TO THE MOCKING BIRD STILL SINGING
I AIN'T EVER SEEN THE SEA HARRY BUT IT MUST BE A MIGHTY SIGHT PARTICKLARLY
S'POSE YOU STOP UP IN THE HILLS WITH US
JARVIS TOOK A SMALL FLAT SKILLET FROM THE BOAT AND FRIED THE CORN CAKES HARRY FRIED BACON AND STRIPS OF DRIED BEEF IN ANOTHER THE HOMELY TASK IN GOOD COMPANY
BUT THE CREEK IS SO HIGH NOW THAT WE KIN MAKE AT LEAST TWENTY MILES MORE AN TIE UP AT BILL RUDD'S PLACE
DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS THE REGION HAD ALL THE ASPECTS OF A COMPLETE WILDERNESS NOW AND THEN THEY SAW SMOKE WHICH JARVIS SAID
I GUESS YOU KNOW EM HARRY HE SAID YES REPLIED THE BOY SEE THE ONE IN THE CENTER WITH THE DROOPING MUSTACHES AND THE SPLENDID FIGURE PEOPLE HAVE CALLED HIM THE HANDSOMEST MAN
FOR THE THOUGHT OF HER IS ONE THAT NEVER DIES SHE'S SLEEPING IN THE VALLEY AND THE MOCKING BIRD IS SINGING WHERE SHE LIES LISTEN TO THE MOCKING BIRD SINGING O'ER HER GRAVE
WENT HIS THOUGHTS AGAIN TO THE FAR OFF TROUBLED TIME WHEN THE HUNTER IN THE VAST WILDERNESS DEPENDED FOR HIS LIFE ON THE QUICKNESS OF EYE AND EAR HE HAD READ SO MUCH OF BOONE AND KENTON
FAREWELL FAREWELL WE'RE SEEIN EM GOIN SOUTH HARRY I DREAM AHEAD SOMETIMES AN I DREAM WITH MY EYES OPEN
SAID JARVIS WHO GLANCING AT HIM HAD READ HIS MIND WITH ALMOST UNCANNY INTUITION TIMES LIKE THESE THE INJUNS AN THE WILD ANIMALS ALL COME BACK
SAID JARVIS AT THE SECOND CABIN I KNOW THE MAN WHO LIVES IN IT AN HE'S TO BE TRUSTED WE'D HAVE LEFT THE BOAT AN THE THINGS WITH HIM
THAT'S SO I LIKE THE WEEPY ONES BEST BUT THEY DON'T REALLY MAKE ME FEEL SAD HARRY THEY JEST FILL ME WITH A KIND O LONGIN TO REACH OUT AN GRAB SOMETHIN
CALLED JARVIS CHEERFULLY LOOK WHAT A FINE WORLD IT IS HERE'S THE RIVER ALL WASHED CLEAN AN THE LAND ALL WASHED CLEAN TOO STIR YOURSELVES
VERY LIKELY YOU'D BE SEASICK IF YOU WERE ON IT THEN I LIKE IT BEST WHEN THE WAVES ARE NOT RUNNING THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CEASED AFTER A WHILE
UNLESS YOU AND IKE THROW ME OUT OF THE BOAT WELL SPOKE BOY SAID JARVIS HE DID NOT TELL HARRY THAT COLONEL KENTON
AN WE'LL TAKE YOU IN AIN'T THAT SO IKE IKE GRINNED AND NODDED HIS UNCLE LOOKED AT HIM ADMIRINGLY IKE'S A LUNKHEAD HE SAID BUT HE'S GREAT TO TRAVEL WITH
WAS LONG IN DYING ON THE RIVER DID YOU PICK UP THAT TOO FROM A WANDERING FIDDLER ASKED HARRY NO I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GOT IT
THEY WERE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE LAST SUCH STOP JARVIS REMARKED RATHER GRIMLY THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE GOOD RIFLES IN THIS BOAT
LIKE AS NOT THEY'RE SOLDIERS IN THIS WAR
A VAST MASS OF SHIMMERING GREEN THE RAIN HAD CEASED ENTIRELY BUT THE WHOLE EARTH WAS SWEET AND CLEAN FROM ITS GREAT BATH LEAVES AND GRASS HAD TAKEN ON A DEEPER TINT
LESS IT'S THAT LUNKHEAD IKE MY NEPHEW ARE YOU WILLIN TO LET HIM HAVE IT IKE IKE GRINNED AND NODDED THE KENTUCKY NARROWED AND THE CURRENT GREW YET STRONGER
AND FINDING AN ABUNDANCE OF FALLEN WOOD ALONG THE BEACH THEY PULLED IT INTO A HEAP AND KINDLED A FIRE THE NIGHT AS USUAL WAS COOL BUT THE PLEASANT FLAMES DISPELLED THE CHILL
ME AN THAT LUNKHEAD IKE MY NEPHEW
HERE YOU ARE BREAKFAST ALL READY
EF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ON THE TRIP
SAID JARVIS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A GENUINE APPETITE IS UNTIL YOU LIVE UNDER THE BLUE SKY BY DAY
BUT I GUESS WE'D BETTER KEEP OUT O THEIR BUSINESS THOUGH MY INQUIRIN TURN O MIND MAKES ME ANXIOUS TO SEE JUST WHO THEY ARE THEY WALKED TO THE END OF THE STRETCH OF BUSHES AND
NITA JUANITA LET ME LINGER BY THY SIDE NITA JUANITA BE THOU MY OWN FAIR BRIDE THE SONG CEASED AND THE MURMUR OF THE RIVER CAME MORE CLEARLY
I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE OUR MOUNTAINS AG'IN THE BOAT SOON REACHED A POINT WHERE LOWER BANKS RAN FOR SOME TIME AND FROM THE CENTER OF THE STREAM THEY SAW THE NOBLE COUNTRY OUTSPREAD BEFORE THEM
TWO WILD TURKEYS JARVIS AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD ARRIVE HOME FULL HANDED IN EVERY RESPECT AND HIS GREAT TENOR BOOMED OUT JOYOUSLY OVER THE STREAM
AND MAKING A CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE EDGES OF WHICH TOUCHED THE BOAT HARRY FOUND THAT JARVIS WAS TELLING THE TRUTH THE LONG WORK AND THE COOL NIGHT AIR WITHOUT A ROOF ABOVE HIM
HE SAT UP IN HIS BLANKETS AND LOOKED AROUND A MERE MASS OF BLACK COALS SHOWED WHERE THE FIRE HAD BEEN AND TWO LONG DARK OBJECTS LOOKING LIKE LOGS IN THE DIM LIGHT WERE HIS COMRADES
IN ORDINARY WATER
THEY WERE NOW ROWING ALONG A SOUTHERLY FORK OF THE KENTUCKY ANOTHER DEER HAD BEEN KILLED FALLING THIS TIME TO THE RIFLE OF JARVIS AND ONE NIGHT THEY SHOT
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED IN A WHISPER PEOPLE CROSSING THE RIVER AT THE FERRY ABOVE HARRY WHISPERED BACK
SAID JARVIS HARRY SLEPT IN A HOUSE THAT NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DAYS AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT HE AWOKE ONCE WITH A FEELING AS IF WALLS WERE PRESSING DOWN UPON HIM
NOW IS YOUR TIME TO JOIN EM STEAD O WORKIN YOUR WAY CROSS THE HILLS WITH TWO IGNORANT MOUNTAINEERS
NOW FELLERS WE'LL PUT OUT THE FIRE AN ROLL IN OUR BLANKETS I GUESS WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP ANY WATCH HERE HARRY WAS SOON IN A DREAMLESS SLEEP
IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE THREE AND ALL THEIR SUPPLIES DRY AND HARRY WATCHED THE STORM BEAT SULLEN THUNDER ROLLED UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST
BUT THE RAIN CAME WITH A STEADY DRIVING RUSH THE NIGHT HAD NOW SETTLED DOWN THICK AND DARK AND AS THE BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE VERY HIGH HARRY FELT AS IF THEY WERE IN A BLACK CANYON
TREADIN ON DEAD MEN THOSE ARE GOOD MEN BRAVE AND GENEROUS OH I DON'T MEAN THEM IN PARTICKLER
WAS RISING FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF LOG CABINS AND ONCE OR TWICE THEY SAW CABINS THEMSELVES IN SHELTERED NOOKS BUT NOBODY HAILED THEM THE NEWS OF THE WAR HAD SPREAD HERE OF COURSE
SOMETIMES THE CREEK FLOWED BETWEEN CLIFFS AND AGAIN IT OPENED OUT INTO NARROW VALLEYS IN A TWO DAYS JOURNEY UP ITS COURSE THEY PASSED ONLY TWO CABINS
AN SO'S THE FISHIN HARRY SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO ASK ME HE SAID BUT I'M BOUND TO GO ON WA'AL
WHERE THE WARM LIGHT LOVES TO DWELL WEARY LOOKS YET TENDER SPEAK THEIR FOND FAREWELL NITA JUANITA ASK THY SOUL IF WE SHOULD PART NITA JUANITA LEAN THOU ON MY HEART
THE LIGHTNING BLAZING AT INTERVALS AND THE THUNDER ROLLING IN A SUBLIME REFRAIN MOVED HARRY TO HIS INMOST SOUL THE SONG CEASED BUT ITS ECHO
I DON'T SHOOT DEER CEPT WHEN I NEED EM TO EAT SAID JARVIS AN WE DO NEED THIS ONE WE'LL BROIL STRIPS OF HIM OVER THE COALS IN THE MORNIN DON'T YOUR MOUTH WATER HARRY
AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN HE VOLUNTEERED GLADLY TO TAKE CARE OF THE BOAT AND ITS BELONGINGS WHILE JARVIS AND THE BOYS WENT ON THE NEXT DAY TO JARVIS'S HOME ABOUT TEN MILES AWAY RUDD
THEY LEFT THE FORK OF THE KENTUCKY AT LAST AND ROWED UP ONE OF THE DEEP AND NARROW MOUNTAIN CREEKS PEAKS TOWERED ALL ABOUT THEM A HALF MILE OVER THEIR HEADS
AND HARROD AND HIS OWN GREAT ANCESTOR AND THE IMPRESSION WAS SO VIVID THAT THE VISION WAS TRANSLATED INTO FACT
HARRY YOU'LL FIND THREE TIN PLATES IN THE LOCKER IN THE BOAT FETCH EM HARRY ABANDONED HIS SKILLET FOR A MOMENT AND BROUGHT THE PLATES IKE THE COFFEE NOW BEING ABOUT READY
HARRY'S EYES KINDLED TOO I SAY THAT I WANT THE FIRST SHOT JARVIS LAUGHED TRUE SPERRIT HE SAID NOBODY WILL SET UP A CLAIM AG'INST YOU
KEPT HIM FULL COMPANY DIDN'T I TELL YOU IT WAS FINE SAID JARVIS STRETCHING HIS LONG LENGTH AND SIGHING WITH CONTENT I FEEL SO GOOD THAT I'M NEAR BUSTIN INTO SONG
THEY WORE SLOUCH HATS AND WERE WRAPPED IN HEAVY DARK CLOAKS
BRECKINRIDGE YES JOHN C BRECKINRIDGE WHY HE'S YOUNGER THAN I EXPECTED HE DON'T LOOK MORE'N FORTY JUST ABOUT FORTY I SHOULD SAY
ROBED IN THE SABLE GARB OF WOE WITH HAGGARD EYES THE POET STOOD LOOSE HIS BEARD AND HOARY HAIR STREAM'D LIKE A METEOR TO THE TROUBLED AIR AND WITH A MASTER'S HAND AND PROPHET'S FIRE STRUCK THE DEEP SORROWS OF HIS LYRE
ENOUGH FOR ME WITH JOY I SEE THE DIFFERENT DOOM OUR FATES ASSIGN BE THINE DESPAIR AND SCEPTRED CARE TO TRIUMPH AND TO DIE ARE MINE HE SPOKE AND HEADLONG FROM THE MOUNTAIN'S HEIGHT DEEP IN THE ROARING TIDE HE PLUNGED TO ENDLESS NIGHT
FLORENCE CAME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY TO BANDAGE THE LEG
BUT THERE WERE FEW DEARER TO HIM THAN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THEY HAD THE SAME TASTES AND FEELINGS BOTH LOVED TO HELP AND COMFORT ALL WHO WERE IN TROUBLE SORROW NEED SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER ADVERSITY
IN BUSKIN'D MEASURES MOVE PALE GRIEF AND PLEASING PAIN WITH HORROR TYRANT OF THE THROBBING BREAST A VOICE AS OF THE CHERUB CHOIR GALES FROM BLOOMING EDEN BEAR
AS I SAID FLORENCE AND THE VICAR WERE RIDING ALONG ON THE GREEN DOWNS AND HERE I MUST STOP AGAIN A MOMENT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE DOWNS ARE FOR WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO WONDER
WHAT IS THE MATTER ROGER HE ASKED KINDLY WHERE IS YOUR DOG THE BOYS HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT HIM SIR REPLIED THE OLD MAN THEY HAVE BROKEN HIS LEG POOR BEAST AND HE WILL NEVER BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AGAIN
THE LITTLE FINGERS GROWN SO SKILLFUL BY BANDAGING WAXEN AND CHINA ARMS AND LEGS WERE NOW TO SAVE A LIVING LOVING CREATURE FROM DEATH TO EVERY ENGLISH CHILD THIS STORY IS A NURSERY TALE
TO THEE BELONGS THE RURAL REIGN THY CITIES SHALL WITH COMMERCE SHINE ALL THINE SHALL BE THE SUBJECT MAIN AND EVERY SHORE IT CIRCLES THINE THE MUSES STILL WITH FREEDOM FOUND SHALL TO THY HAPPY COAST REPAIR
ABOVE BELOW THE ROSE OF SNOW TWINED WITH HER BLUSHING FOE WE SPREAD THE BRISTLED BOAR IN INFANT GORE WALLOWS BENEATH THE THORNY SHADE
THOUGH SHE MIGHT BUT JUST HAVE GOT ON HER NEW FROCK THEN MAMMA FLORENCE WOULD WAIT UPON HER TENDERLY SMOOTHING HER PILLOW BATHING HER FOREHEAD OR RUBBING HER POOR BACK AND BRINGING HER ALL KINDS OF GOOD THINGS IN THE DOLL HOUSE DISHES
TO DWELL A WEEPING HERMIT THERE W COLLINS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE
AND THE CONVERSATION AS WILL BE THE CASE WHERE ALL ARE IN EARNEST QUICKLY FOUND THE RIGHT CHANNEL IT IS NOT OFTEN IN REAL LIFE THAT SUCH CONVERSATIONS OCCUR GENERALLY IN ANY TALK WORTH CALLING CONVERSATION EVERY MAN HAS SOME POINT TO MAINTAIN
I'VE HEARD THEM LILTING AT OUR EWE MILKING LASSES A LILTING BEFORE DAWN O DAY BUT NOW THEY ARE MOANING ON ILKA GREEN LOANING THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST ARE A WEDE AWAY
YOUR COUNTER IS OR OUGHT TO BE HIS ALTAR AND EVERYTHING THEREON LAID WITH INTENT OF DOING AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR IN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHRIST JESUS IS A TRUE SACRIFICE OFFERED TO HIM
THROUGH THE NEEDS OF HIS CHILDREN ALL THE WORKING DAY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT SO LONG AS THERE IS A CUSTOMER IN YOUR SHOP I DO THINK YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID THE LINEN DRAPER I HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE SAME THING THE OTHER NIGHT MYSELF
IT STANDS MERELY FOR THE FORMS OF PUBLIC WORSHIP WERE THERE NO SUCH THING AS DIVINE SERVICE IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD THEN INDEED IT WOULD SCARCELY BE WORTH WHILE TO QUARREL WITH ITS MISAPPLICATION BUT I ASSERT THAT TRUE AND GENUINE SERVICE MAY BE RENDERED TO THE LIVING GOD
HER MOTHER MEANTIME TAUGHT HER ALL KINDS OF HANDIWORK AND BEFORE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE COULD HEMSTITCH AND SEAM AND EMBROIDER THESE THINGS WERE ALL GOOD AND VERY GOOD WITHOUT THEM SHE COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL SHE DID
BRIGHT RAPTURE CALLS AND SOARING AS SHE SINGS WAVES IN THE EYE OF HEAVEN HER MANY COLOUR'D WINGS THE VERSE ADORN AGAIN FIERCE WAR AND FAITHFUL LOVE AND TRUTH SEVERE BY FAIRY FICTION DREST
ENJOYS THE CONTEMPLATION OF IT AND THINKS WHAT A PLEASANT OBJECT HE THUS MAKES OF HIMSELF TO HIS PARENTS SHALL I TO TAKE A STEP FARTHER DEGRADE THE SANCTITY OF THE CLOSET HALLOWED IN THE WORDS OF JESUS
FOR THERE I LOST MY FATHER DEAR MY FATHER DEAR AND BRETHREN THREE THEIR WINDING SHEET THE BLUIDY CLAY THEIR GRAVES ARE GROWING GREEN TO SEE AND BY THEM LIES THE DEAREST LAD THAT EVER BLEST A WOMAN'S EE
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A CHILD WHO SAID I AM VERY USEFUL TO MY FATHER FOR WHEN I ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING OR TELL HIM I LOVE HIM IT GIVES HIM OH SUCH PLEASURE I SHOULD SAY HE WAS AN UNENDURABLE PRIG BETTER HE HAD TO BE WHIPPED FOR STEALING SAID THE CURATE
FOR WHENEVER SHE SAW FLORENCE AT THE GATE SHE WOULD TOSS HER HEAD AND WHINNY AND COME TROTTING UP TO THE GATE GOOD MORNING PEGGY FLORENCE WOULD SAY WOULD YOU LIKE AN APPLE
WHETHER IT MAY BE REACHED IN THIS WORLD OR NOT THAT IS A QUESTION OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHETHER A MAN HAS BEGUN TO REACH AFTER IT IS OF THE UTMOST AWFULNESS OF IMPORT
WHILE THE OLD MAN LAMENTED FLORENCE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY IN THE FACE OF THE CLERGYMAN HE MET HER LOOK WITH A SMILE AND NOD WE WILL GO AND SEE HE SAID AND OFF THEY RODE LEAVING ROGER SHAKING HIS HEAD AND CALLING TO THE SHEEP
WHEN I USE THE PHRASE DIVINE SERVICE I MEAN NOTHING WHATEVER BELONGING TO THE CHURCH OR ITS OBSERVANCES I MEAN BY IT WHAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN THE SERVING OF GOD THE DOING OF SOMETHING FOR GOD
WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST SHE SAID WELL SAID THE VICAR I THINK A HOT COMPRESS IS THE THING FLORENCE LOOKED PUZZLED THE DOLLS HAD NEVER HAD HOT COMPRESSES WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED
BY FAIRY HANDS THEIR KNELL IS RUNG BY FORMS UNSEEN THEIR DIRGE IS SUNG THERE HONOUR COMES A PILGRIM GRAY TO BLESS THE TURF THAT WRAPS THEIR CLAY AND FREEDOM SHALL AWHILE REPAIR
AND MORE PLEASE HORSE LANGUAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE COMPARED TO ENGLISH AND HAS NO GRAMMAR WELL ONE DAY FLORENCE WAS RIDING HER PONY IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND THE VICAR THIS GOOD MAN LOVED ALL LIVING CREATURES
IN YON BRIGHT TRACK THAT FIRES THE WESTERN SKIES THEY MELT THEY VANISH FROM MY EYES BUT O WHAT SOLEMN SCENES ON SNOWDON'S HEIGHT DESCENDING SLOW THEIR GLITTERING SKIRTS UNROLL VISIONS OF GLORY SPARE MY ACHING SIGHT
BUT I CANNOT GET A HOLD OF YOUR REMARKS ONE MOMENT I THINK I HAVE GOT THE END OF THE CLEW
FOR MONY A HEART THOU HAST MADE SAIR THAT NE'ER DID WRONG TO THINE OR THEE R BURNS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX LAMENT FOR FLODDEN
POOR CAP'S DAYS IS OVER AH HE WERE A GOOD DOG DO EVERYTHING BUT SPEAK HE COULD AND WENT AS NEAR TO THAT AS A DUMB BEAST COULD I'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER LIKE HIM
SPRINGS FROM HIS SEAT AT MY KNEE FINDS THAT WHICH WILL MEET MY NECESSITY AND IS MY EAGER HAPPY SERVANT OF CONSEQUENCE IN HIS OWN EYES INASMUCH AS HE HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR HIS FATHER HIS SEAT BY MY KNEE IS LOVE DELIGHT WELL BEING PEACE NOT SERVICE
FAR FAR ALOOF THE AFFRIGHTED RAVENS SAIL THE FAMISH'D EAGLE SCREAMS AND PASSES BY DEAR LOST COMPANIONS OF MY TUNEFUL ART DEAR AS THE LIGHT THAT VISITS THESE SAD EYES DEAR AS THE RUDDY DROPS THAT WARM MY HEART
THEY ENTERED AND THERE LAY CAP ON THE BRICK FLOOR HELPLESS AND WEAK BUT STILL BARKING AS HARD AS HE COULD AT WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE INTRUDERS WHEN HE SAW FLORENCE AND THE LITTLE BOY HE STOPPED BARKING AND WAGGED HIS TAIL FEEBLY
I MUST LIVE I CANNOT GIVE MY GOODS AWAY MURMURED MISTER DREW THINKINGLY AS ONE THAT SOUGHT ENLIGHTENMENT THAT WOULD BE TO GO DIRECT AGAINST THE ORDER OF HIS WORLD SAID POLWARTH NO A HARDER TASK IS YOURS MISTER DREW
AND GORGEOUS DAMES AND STATESMEN OLD IN BEARDED MAJESTY APPEAR IN THE MIDST A FORM DIVINE HER EYE PROCLAIMS HER OF THE BRITON LINE HER LION PORT HER AWE COMMANDING FACE ATTEMPER'D SWEET TO VIRGIN GRACE
IS THE SABLE WARRIOR FLED THY SON IS GONE HE RESTS AMONG THE DEAD THE SWARM THAT IN THY NOON TIDE BEAM WERE BORN GONE TO SALUTE THE RISING MORN FAIR LAUGHS THE MORN AND SOFT THE ZEPHYR BLOWS
NOR IS IT HARD TO DISCOVER HOW FOR GOD IS IN EVERY CREATURE THAT HE HAS MADE AND IN THEIR NEEDS HE IS NEEDY AND IN ALL THEIR AFFLICTIONS HE IS AFFLICTED THEREFORE JESUS SAYS THAT WHATEVER IS DONE TO ONE OF HIS LITTLE ONES IS DONE TO HIM
PERFECT IN WISDOM STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING OF WHOM PAUL SAYS THAT HE IS NOT WORSHIPPED WITH MEN'S HANDS AS THOUGH HE NEEDED ANYTHING I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT YOU ARE FIGHTING MERELY WITH A WORD
AND DAMMING BACK THE TIDE OF THE DAWN FROM HIS DISEASED AND TORMENTED SOUL LITTLE CONVERSATION WAS THEREFORE POSSIBLE
HER WHOLE BEARING NOW AS ALWAYS WAS THAT OF ONE WHO PERFECTLY TRUSTED A SUPREME SPIRIT UNDER WHOSE INFLUENCES LAY EVEN THE RUGGED MATERIAL OF HER DEFORMED DWELLING POLWARTH ALLOWED WINGFOLD TO HELP HIM IN GETTING TEA
HARK HOW EACH GIANT OAK AND DESERT CAVE SIGHS TO THE TORRENT'S AWFUL VOICE BENEATH
REVENGE ON THEE IN HOARSER MURMURS BREATHE VOCAL NO MORE SINCE CAMBRIA'S FATAL DAY TO HIGH BORN HOEL'S HARP OR SOFT LLEWELLYN'S LAY COLD IS CADWALLO'S TONGUE THAT HUSH'D THE STORMY MAIN
HE HAD STUDIED MEDICINE BEFORE HE BECAME A CLERGYMAN AND SO WAS ABLE TO TELL HER MANY THINGS ABOUT THE CARE OF THE SICK AND INJURED HERE WAS ANOTHER TEACHER I SUPPOSE EVERYONE WE KNOW COULD TEACH US SOMETHING GOOD IF WE WERE READY TO LEARN
SHALL I MAKE OF THE CHURCH IN MY FOOLISH IMAGINATIONS A TEMPLE OF IDOLATROUS WORSHIP BY SUPPOSING THAT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF SUPPLYING SOME NEED THAT GOD HAS OR OF GRATIFYING SOME TASTE IN HIM THAT I THERE LISTEN TO HIS WORD SAY PRAYERS TO HIM AND SING HIS PRAISES
AS THE LOUD BLAST THAT TEARS THE SKIES SERVES BUT TO ROOT THY NATIVE OAK THEE HAUGHTY TYRANTS NE'ER SHALL TAME ALL THEIR ATTEMPTS TO BEND THEE DOWN WILL BUT AROUSE THY GENEROUS FLAME AND WORK THEIR WOE AND THY RENOWN
BLEST ISLE WITH MATCHLESS BEAUTY CROWN'D AND MANLY HEARTS TO GUARD THE FAIR RULE BRITANNIA BRITTANIA RULES THE WAVES BRITONS NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES J THOMSON
THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST THAT FOUGHT AYE THE FOREMOST THE PRIME OF OUR LAND ARE CAULD IN THE CLAY WE'LL HEAR
IS IT BROKEN ASKED FLORENCE ANXIOUSLY NO SAID THE VICAR NO BONES ARE BROKEN THERE'S NO REASON WHY CAP SHOULD NOT RECOVER ALL HE NEEDS IS CARE AND NURSING FLORENCE QUIETLY LAID DOWN HER RIDING WHIP AND TUCKED UP HER SLEEVES
BUT I WILL NOT JUDGE THAT IS FOR THE GOD ENLIGHTENED CONSCIENCE OF THE MAN HIMSELF TO DO NOT FOR HIS NEIGHBOUR'S WHY SHOULD I BE JUDGED BY ANOTHER MAN'S CONSCIENCE BUT YOU SEE MISTER DREW AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS DRIVING AT THAT YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO SERVE GOD
THEY MOCK THE AIR WITH IDLE STATE HELM NOR HAUBERK'S TWISTED MAIL NOR E E N THY VIRTUES TYRANT SHALL AVAIL TO SAVE THY SECRET SOUL FROM NIGHTLY FEARS FROM CAMBRIA'S CURSE FROM CAMBRIA'S TEARS
BY SHUTTING ITS DOOR IN THE VAIN FANCY OF THERE DOING SOMETHING THAT GOD REQUIRES OF ME AS A SACRED OBSERVANCE SHALL I FOOLISHLY IMAGINE THAT TO PUT IN EXERCISE THE HIGHEST AND LOVELIEST THE MOST ENTRANCING PRIVILEGE OF EXISTENCE
MAY NOT AT ONCE SHOW ITSELF TO ANOTHER WHEN PRESENTED IN THE FORMS OF A FOREIGN INDIVIDUALITY
CLOSE BY THE REGAL CHAIR FELL THIRST AND FAMINE SCOWL A BALEFUL SMILE UPON THEIR BAFFLED GUEST HEARD YE THE DIN OF BATTLE BRAY LANCE TO LANCE AND HORSE TO HORSE LONG YEARS OF HAVOCK URGE THEIR DESTINED COURSE
I SHALL ATTEMPT ONLY A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE RESULT OF THEIR EVENING'S INTERCOURSE PARTLY RECORDING THE UTTERANCES OF POLWARTH
AND STUDIED REGULARLY AND HAD MUSIC AND DRAWING LESSONS BESIDES AND HER FATHER TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ENGLISH LITERATURE AND LATER OPENED TO HER THE GREAT DOORS MARKED LATIN AND GREEK
THEY ARE GREAT ROUNDED HILLS COVERED WITH CLOSE THICK TURF LIKE A VELVET CARPET THEY SPREAD IN LONG SMOOTH GREEN BILLOWS MILES AND MILES OF THEM
I SAY NOT POLWARTH WENT ON THAT SO DOING YOU WILL GROW A RICH MAN BUT I SAY THAT SO DOING YOU WILL BE SAVED FROM GROWING TOO RICH AND THAT YOU WILL BE A FELLOW WORKER WITH GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF HIS WORLD
IT WAS AT THIS STAGE OF THE COMEDY OF ERRORS THAT MOODY BEGBIE AND MAYNE CAME ON THE SCENE AT FIRST M'GOWAN SHOWED TRUCULENCE AND ASSAILED MOODY
DOUGLAS APPOINTED MAGISTRATES TO TRY THE CASE THE TRIAL WAS OF COURSE ILLEGAL FOR COLONIAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY INAUGURATED IN NEW CALEDONIA OR BRITISH COLUMBIA AS IT WAS SOON TO BE KNOWN
OTHER MINES WERE FOUND IN A LESS SPECTACULAR WAY THE FLOAT LOST ITSELF IN A ROUNDED KNOLL IN THE LAP OF A DOZEN PEAKS AND THE MINERS HAD TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE BENCHES TO TUNNEL
THERE WAS ONLY THE NARROW FOOTPATH OF THE TRAPPER AND THE FISHERMAN CLOSE DOWN TO THE WATER AND WHEN THE ROCKS BROKE OFF IN SHEER PRECIPICE AN UNSTEADY BRIDGE OF POLES AND WILLOWS SPANNED THE ABYSS
OLD SANDY WAS STILL SLEEPING I THOUGHT I WOULD LET MYSELF DOWN OVER THE LEDGE AND SEE WHAT WAS BELOW FOR THERE WERE NO MINERAL SIGNS WHERE WE WERE
AND THERE THE FORCES WERE TRANSFERRED TO TOM WRIGHT'S STERN WHEELER THE ENTERPRISE BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT HOPE THE WHOLE AFFAIR LOOKED LIKE SEMI COMIC VAUDEVILLE
ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM END TO END TWO FEET ACROSS AND TWO DEEP THE SIDES CONVERGED TO BOTTOM AT THE HEAD WAS A PERFORATED SHEET IRON BOTTOM LIKE A HOUSEWIFE'S COLANDER INTO THIS BOX THE GRAVEL WAS SHOVELLED BY ONE MINER
AND TRIED TO EXTORT HIGH ALIMONY BY CLAIMING THEIR TWO YEAR OLD SON THE PENNILESS PROSPECTOR KNEW THAT HE WAS NO EQUAL FOR LAW COURTS AND SHERIFFS AND LAWYERS SO HE MADE HIM A RAFT GOT A LOCAL TRADER TO OUTFIT HIM
THE MINERS BEGAN MOVING UP THE RIVER PROSPECTING THOSE WITH HORSES HAD LITERALLY TO CUT THE WAY WITH THEIR AXES OVER WINDFALL OVER STEEP BANKS AND ROUND PRECIPITOUS CLIFFS WHERE RIVERS HAD TO BE CROSSED
THESE TRAVELLERS NATURALLY DID NOT ATTEMPT FRASER CANYON BEFORE CHRISTMAS OF FIFTY NINE PROSPECTORS HAD SPREAD INTO LILLOOET AND UP THE RIVER AS HIGH AS CHILCOTIN SODA CREEK ALEXANDRIA COTTONWOOD CANYON
HE APOLOGIZED PAID HIS FINE FOR THE ASSAULT AND INVITED THE OFFICERS TO A CHAMPAGNE DINNER ON HILL'S BAR BOTH SIDES TO THE QUARREL COOLED DOWN AND THE RIOTS ENDED
THAT ONE DESPERATE FELLOW WENT TO A LOG SHACK CALLED A GROCERY STORE AND AFTER PAYING A DOLLAR FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF USING A GRINDSTONE BOUGHT AN EMPTY BUTTER VAT AT THE POUND PRICE OF BUTTER TWELVE DOLLARS FOR AN EMPTY BUTTER TUB
HOW FAR I ASKED ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILES WE THREW OURSELVES DOWN TO SLEEP IT WAS TERRIBLY COLD WE WERE HIGH UP AND THE FALL FROSTS WERE ICY I TELL YOU I WOKE ACHING AT DAYBREAK
QUESNEL AND FORT GEORGE IT WAS SAFER TO ASCEND SUCH WILD STREAMS THAN TO RUN WITH THE CURRENT THOUGH COUNTLESS CANOES AND THEIR OCCUPANTS WERE NEVER HEARD OF AFTER LEAVING YALE WHERE THE TURBID YELLOW FLOOD BEGAN TO RISE AND COLLECT'
THEN HE BROUGHT THE BOY DOWN AND SENT HIM TO SCHOOL WHEN THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY CROSSED THE ROCKIES THAT MAN BECAME ONE OF THE FAMOUS GUIDES HE WAS THE FIRST GUIDE I EVER EMPLOYED IN THE MOUNTAINS
BUT SALT WAS A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND BUTTER A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND AND FLOUR RARER THAN NUGGETS
THERE WAS THE LURE OF HOPE EDGING EVERY SUNRISE THERE WAS THE FRESH WASHED OZONE FRAGRANT WITH THE RESINOUS EXUDATIONS OF THE GREAT TREES OF THE FOREST THERE WAS THE HEALING REGENERATION TO BODY AND SOUL
MEALS COST A DOLLAR SERVED ON TIN PLATES TO DINERS STANDING IN LONG ROWS WAITING TURN AT THE COUNTER THE REGULAR MENU AT ALL MEALS WAS BACON SALMON BREAD AND COFFEE OF BUTTER THERE WAS LITTLE
AND THE PRICE OF LAND DROPPED IN THE BOOM TOWNS OF THE FRASER AS SWIFTLY AS IT HAD BEEN BALLOONED UP PROSPECTING DURING THE WINTER IN A COUNTRY OF HEAVY SNOWFALL DID NOT SEEM A SANE PROJECT AND YET THE ETERNAL QUESTION URGED THE MINERS ON
WAS THE LEDGE WHERE FLOAT HAD BEEN BREAKING AND WASHING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SO YOU SEE ONLY ELEVEN DAYS FROM THE TIME WE WERE GOING TO GIVE UP WE MADE OUR FIND THAT MINE PAID FROM THE FIRST LOAD OF ORE SENT OUT BY PACK HORSES
STREAMS MILKY OR BLUE OR PEACOCK GREEN CAME FROM GLACIERS ICE GRINDING OVER ROCK HEAVY MISTS OFTEN ADDED TO THE DANGERS
THOUGH WE WERE ON A WELL CUT BRIDLE TRAIL HE BADE US PAUSE AS ONE SIDE OF THE TRAIL HAD A SHEER DROP OF FOUR THOUSAND FEET IN PLACES BEFORE THERE WERE ANY TRAILS
DOUGLAS KNEW HOW TO USE ALL THE POMP OF REGIMENTALS AND FORMALITY TO IMPRESS THE INDIANS HE OPENED A SOLEMN POWWOW WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE FRASER AS USUAL THE WHITE MAN'S FIRE WATER WAS FOUND TO BE THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE
WHEN STREAMS WERE DIRECTED THROUGH WOODEN BOXES THE GOLD WAS SLUICED ON A STILL LARGER SCALE THE PROCESS WAS HYDRAULIC MINING THOUGH THE SAME IN PRINCIPLE
SUNRISE STEALS IN SILENCE AMONG THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS THERE IS NONE OF THAT STIR OF SONG AND VAGUE RUSTLING OF ANIMAL LIFE SUCH AS ARE HEARD AT LOWER LEVELS NOR DOES THE LIGHT GRADUALLY RISE ABOVE THE EASTERN HORIZON
GOLD HAD ALSO BEEN FOUND IN CRACKS IN THE ROCK ALONG THE RIVER WHENCE HAD IT COME THE MAN FARTHEST UPSTREAM IN SPRING WOULD BE ON THE GROUND FIRST FOR THE GREAT FIND THAT WAS BOUND TO MAKE SOME SEEKER'S FORTUNE SO ALL STAYED WHO COULD
ALL LIQUOR WHEREVER FOUND WAS ORDERED SPILLED
WHICH IS TO THE PROSPECTOR THE ONE SHINING SIGNAL TO BE FOLLOWED TIMBER LINE IS PASSED TILL THE FORESTS BELOW LOOK LIKE DANK BANKS OF MOSS CLOUD LINE IS PASSED TILL THE CLOUDS LIE UNDERNEATH IN GREY LAKES AND POOLS
GREY GREEN AND FEATHERY HUNG FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH OF THE HUGE DOUGLAS FIRS SOMETIMES THE TRAIL WOULD LEAD FOR MILES ROUND THE EDGE OF SOME PRECIPICES BEYOND WHICH COULD BE GLIMPSED THE ETERNAL SNOWS
WHEN WORD CAME OF THIS MURDER THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF YALE FORMED A RIFLE COMPANY OF FORTY WHICH IN AUGUST STARTED UP TO THE FORKS AT LYTTON AT SPUZZUM THERE WAS A FIGHT INDIANS BARRED THE WAY
HALF A DOLLAR WAS THE SMALLEST COIN USED AND CLOTHING WAS SO SCARCE THAT WHEN A CHINAMAN'S PIG CHEWED UP WALTER MOBERLY'S BOOTS WHILE THE SURVEYOR LAY ASLEEP IN HIS SHACK MISTER MOBERLY HAD TO FOOT IT TWENTY FIVE MILES BEFORE HE COULD FIND ANOTHER PAIR OF BOOTS
THE POSSIBILITY OF AMERICAN OCCUPATION HAD BECOME AN OBSESSION AT VICTORIA THERE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY THOSE AMONG THE AMERICAN MINERS WHO MADE WILD BOASTS DOUGLAS GATHERED UP ALL HIS PANOPLY OF WAR AND LAW
BUT THEY WERE ROUTED AND SEVEN OF THEM KILLED IN A RUNNING FIRE AND INDIAN VILLAGES ALONG THE RIVER WERE BURNED MEANWHILE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY VOLUNTEERS AT YALE FORMED A COMPANY TO GO UP THE RIVER UNDER CAPTAIN SNYDER
WHAT WERE THE TEN THOUSAND MEN TO DO CAMPED FOR FIFTY MILES BEYOND YALE THOSE WHO HAD NO PROVISIONS AND COULD NOT INDUCE ANY STOREKEEPER TO GRUBSTAKE THEM FOR A WINTER'S PROSPECTING QUIT THE COUNTRY IN DISGUST
AND RECEIVED A HALF INTEREST IN A MINE THAT YIELDED FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY IN NUGGETS BUT FOR ONE WHO FOUND A MINE A THOUSAND FOUND NOTHING THE SENSATIONS OF THE LUCKY ONE BEGGARED DESCRIPTION WAS IT LUCK OR WAS IT PERSEVERANCE
THEN HE WENT ON TO YALE AT YALE HE CONSIDERED THE PRICE OF PROVISIONS TOO HIGH AND BY ARBITRARILY REDUCING THE PRICE AT THE COMPANY'S STORES HE BROKE THE RING OF THE PETTY DEALERS THIS WON HIM THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE MINERS
FROM SUFFOCATION IF NOT FROM THE CRUSH OF FALLING TREES AND ROCKS MINERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THEIR CABINS DEAD IN THE TRAIL OF A SNOWSLIDE THAT SWEPT THE SHACK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF THEIR HEADS BEING INJURED
SOME OF THE BOYS SAID THEY WOULD GO OUT AND SHOOT ENOUGH DEER TO LAST US FOR MEAT TILL WE COULD GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY OLD SANDY AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY OUR LUCK FOR JUST ONE DAY WE FOLLOWED THAT FLOAT CLEAR ACROSS THE VALLEY WE FOUND MORE
A STEEP SLOPE COMPELS A ZIGZAG CORKSCREW ASCENT BUT THE SLOPE OF THE GROUND GUIDES THE CLIMBER AS TO THE WAY TO GO FOR SLOPE MEANS VALLEY AND IN VALLEYS ARE STREAMS AND IN THE STREAM IS THE FLOAT
AND HE REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIS CHIEF
SOME MILES DOWN THE RIVER HAD BEATEN UP A NEGRO THE YALE MAGISTRATE HAD ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE MINER'S ARREST POOR MAGISTRATE HE HAD FOUND LITTLE TO DO SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT IN SEPTEMBER THE MINER NOW SOBERED FLED BACK TO HIS BAR
OF MILK NONE WHEREVER A SAND BAR GAVE SIGNS OF MINERAL IT WAS TESTED WITH THE PRIMITIVE FRYING PAN IF THE PAN SHOWED A DEPOSIT THE MINER RIGGED UP A ROCKER A CONTRAPTION RESEMBLING A CRADLE WITH ROCKERS BELOW
WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIONS THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN DOWN STREAM FROM THE THOMPSON BY INDIANS AND HAD BEEN SNIPED ALL THE WAY FOR FORTY MILES MAN AFTER MAN HAD FALLEN AND THE FIVE SURVIVORS IN THE BANK WERE ALL WOUNDED
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THAT CHUNK ROLLED DOWN FROM HE KNOCKED IT OPEN WITH HIS MALLET IF IT HAD A SHINY YELLOW PEBBLE INSIDE ONLY THE SIZE OF A PEA THE MINER WOULD STAY ON THAT BANK AND BEGIN BENCH DIGGINGS INTO THE DRY BANK
I HAVE PASSED UP AND DOWN FRASER CANYON TOO OFTEN TO COUNT THE TIMES AND HAVE CANOED ONE WILD RAPID TWICE BUT NEVER WITHOUT WONDERING HOW THOSE FIRST GOLD SEEKERS MANAGED THE ASCENT IN THAT WINTER OF FIFTY NINE THERE WAS NO CARIBOO ROAD THEN
CHAPTER TWO THE PROSPECTOR BY SEPTEMBER WHEN MOUNTAIN RIVERS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EVERY BAR ON THE FRASER FROM YALE TO THE FORKS OF THE THOMPSON WAS OCCUPIED
THE MEN BUILT RUDE RAFTS AND POLED THEMSELVES OVER WITH THEIR PACK HORSES SWIMMING BEHIND THOSE WHO HAD OXEN KILLED THE OXEN AND SOLD THE BEEF OTHERS BREASTED THE MILL RACE OF THE FRASER IN CANOES AND DUGOUTS
AND PLUNGED WITH HIS BABY BOY INTO THE WILDERNESS WHERE NO SHERIFF COULD TRACK HIM I ASKED HIM WHY HE DID NOT USE PACK HORSES HE SAID DOGS COULD HAVE TRACKED THEM BUT THE WATER DIDN'T LEAVE NO SMELL
FOUR HUNDRED PACK HORSES AND A DROVE OF OXEN HAD THREE MEN SNIPED OFF BY INDIANS IN AMBUSH AND MANY CATTLE STOLEN AT BIG CANYON ON THE FRASER TWO FRENCHMEN WERE FOUND MURDERED
NOT HOWEVER BEFORE THERE OCCURRED AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AT LONG BAR WHEN AN INDIAN CHIEF CAME WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE TWO OF THE WHITE MEN SNATCHED IT FROM HIM AND TRAMPLED IT IN THE MUD
THE ARMY STAYED ONLY TO SEE THE MINERS WASH THE GOLD AND THEN PUT BACK TO VICTORIA THE MINERS HAD LEARNED THAT AN ENGLISH JUDGE AND A FIELD FORCE COULD BE PUT ON THE GROUND IN A WEEK SEPTEMBER HAD SETTLED DISORDER AMONG THE INDIANS
THOUGH THE LOGS WERE TWISTED AND WARPED THE DEAD BODIES WERE NOT EVEN BRUISED WHEN A HUSHED WHISPER CAME THROUGH THE TREES TRAVELLERS LOOKED FOR SOME WATERFALL AT MIDDAY WHEN THE THAW WAS AT ITS FULL
FOR THE INDIANS WERE ON THE WAR PATH IN WASHINGTON AND THE UNREST HAD SPREAD TO NEW CALEDONIA YOUNG M'LOUGHLIN SON OF THE FAMOUS JOHN M'LOUGHLIN OF OREGON COMING UP THE COLUMBIA OVERLAND FROM OKANAGAN TO KAMLOOPS WITH A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MEN
WITHIN A WEEK HE HAD ALLAYED ALL IRRITATION BETWEEN WHITE MAN AND INDIAN IN A QUARREL OVER A CLAIM
GOVERNOR DOUGLAS ESTIMATED THAT BEFORE APRIL OF FIFTY NINE AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED BOATS WITH FIVE MEN IN EACH HAD ASCENDED THE FRASER SOMETIMES THE AMAZING SPECTACLE WAS SEEN OF CANOES LASHED TOGETHER IN THE FASHION OF PONTOON BRIDGES
WHEN FIVE THOUSAND PROSPECTORS OVERRAN THE WILD CANYONS AND PRECIPICES OF THE FRASER TWO OR THREE THINGS THE PROSPECTOR ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM MATCHES A KNIFE A GUN RICE FLOUR BACON
THE GENEROUS YANKEE CAPTAIN WAS MOBBED BY PENNILESS AND DESTITUTE MEN FOR RETURN PASSAGE TO THE COAST MANY A BROKEN TREASURE SEEKER OWED HIS LIFE TO TOM WRIGHT'S FREE PASSAGE FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ALWAYS GOOD FISHING ON THE FRASER
EVEN FOR THOSE WHO FOUND NO MINE THE SEARCH WAS NOT WITHOUT REWARD
WE WERE SO TIRED WE HAD HAULED OURSELVES UP BY TREES BRUSHWOOD BRANCHES ANYTHING I LOOKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCK IT DROPPED TO THAT SHELF WE HAD SEEN FROM THE GULLY BELOW IT WAS TOO DARK TO DO ANYTHING MORE
UP STREAM THEN HEADED THE PROSPECTORS ON THE FRASER IN THAT AUTUMN OF FIFTY EIGHT THE MINER'S TRAIN OF PACK HORSES IS A STUDY IN NATURE THERE IS ALWAYS THE WISE OLD BELL MARE LEADING THE WAY
SALOONS OCCUPIED EVERY SECOND SHACK AT YALE AND HOPE REVOLVERS WERE IN ALL BELTS AND EACH MAN WAS HIS OWN SHERIFF YET THERE WAS LITTLE LAWLESSNESS WITH CLAIMS FILED ON ALL GOLD BEARING BARS
HE HAD JUDGED IT TO BE TEN MILES AWAY BUT OUT FROM THE UPPER VALLEY IT CAME COILING LIKE A LONG WHITE SNAKE AND BEFORE HE COULD TURN IT HAD CAUGHT HIM IN A SLIDE DEATH WAS ALMOST CERTAIN
THE AUTUMN LATE THE SNOWFALL LIGHT AND THE SPRING VERY EARLY FATE AS USUAL FAVOURED THE DAUNTLESS IN PARTIES OF TWOS AND TENS AND TWENTIES AND EVEN AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED
ALONG WENT COLONEL MOODY WITH A COMPANY OF HIS ROYAL ENGINEERS LIEUTENANT MAYNE OF THE IMPERIAL NAVY WITH A HUNDRED BLUEJACKETS AND JUDGE MATTHEW BEGBIE TO DEAL OUT JUSTICE TO THE OFFENDERS
