I CANNOT HELP FEELING TERRIBLY EXCITED AS THE TIME DRAWS NEAR FOR THE VISIT OF DOCTOR VAN HELSING FOR SOMEHOW I EXPECT THAT IT WILL THROW SOME LIGHT UPON JONATHAN'S SAD EXPERIENCE AND AS HE ATTENDED POOR DEAR LUCY IN HER LAST ILLNESS HE CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT HER
I SHALL WRITE SO SOON AS EVER I CAN DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER TRULY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FINALITY
AS TO WHAT POOR LUCY DIED OF NOT AFTER ALL THE HINTS GIVEN NOT ONLY BY EVENTS BUT BY ME OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION FOLLOWING ON GREAT LOSS OR WASTE OF BLOOD
I HOPE I DID RIGHT IN NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF IT TO MISSUS WESTENRA I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF ANY ACT OF MINE WERE IT EVEN A NEGATIVE ONE BROUGHT HARM ON POOR DEAR LUCY
SO I HANDED HIM THE SHORTHAND DIARY HE TOOK IT WITH A GRATEFUL BOW AND SAID MAY I READ IT IF YOU WISH I ANSWERED AS DEMURELY AS I COULD HE OPENED IT AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS FACE FELL THEN HE STOOD UP AND BOWED
SHE SOMETIMES KEPT A DIARY YOU NEED NOT LOOK SURPRISED MADAM MINA IT WAS BEGUN AFTER YOU HAD LEFT AND WAS IN IMITATION OF YOU AND IN THAT DIARY
I HAD BEEN THINKING THAT IT WAS OF DEAR LUCY THAT YOU WISHED TO ASK AND SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO WAIT NOT ON MY ACCOUNT BUT BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR TIME MUST BE PRECIOUS I HAVE WRITTEN IT OUT ON THE TYPEWRITER FOR YOU HE TOOK IT AND HIS EYES GLISTENED
TELL ME I SAID I CAN HAZARD NO OPINION I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND I HAVE NO DATA ON WHICH TO FOUND A CONJECTURE
IS NOT ONE TO BE INJURED IN PERMANENCE BY A SHOCK HIS BRAIN AND HIS HEART ARE ALL RIGHT THIS I SWEAR BEFORE I HAVE EVEN SEEN HIM SO BE AT REST I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO ASK HIM OF OTHER THINGS I AM BLESSED THAT TO DAY I COME TO SEE YOU
I DO HOPE THE DEAR FELLOW WILL TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF AND THAT NOTHING WILL OCCUR TO UPSET HIM IT IS TWO O'CLOCK AND THE DOCTOR WILL BE HERE SOON NOW I SHALL SAY NOTHING OF JONATHAN'S JOURNAL
BUT I HAVE SEEN YOUR TRUE SELF SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR HAND WILL YOU NOT AND LET US BE FRIENDS FOR ALL OUR LIVES WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE WAS SO EARNEST AND SO KIND THAT IT MADE ME QUITE CHOKY

AND CORN SOWED ON IT AND THE CORN REAPED AND BE CUT AND SOWN AND REAPED AND CUT AGAIN AND THEN MEN COME AND TAKE AWAY THE UNBROKEN SEAL AND THAT THERE LIE THE INDIAN FAKIR NOT DEAD BUT THAT RISE UP AND WALK AMONGST THEM AS BEFORE
HERE I INTERRUPTED HIM I WAS GETTING BEWILDERED HE SO CROWDED ON MY MIND HIS LIST OF NATURE'S ECCENTRICITIES AND POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBILITIES THAT MY IMAGINATION WAS GETTING FIRED
I HAD A LETTER FROM ARTHUR WRITTEN ON SUNDAY AND FROM IT I GATHER
SO SOON I DO NOT THINK HE REMEMBERED ME AT THE MOMENT JUST THEN THE WHISTLE BLEW AND THE TRAIN MOVED OFF THIS RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF AND HE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WAVED HIS HAND CALLING OUT LOVE TO MADAM MINA
CLEARS THE AIR AS OTHER RAIN DOES PERHAPS IT WAS READING THE JOURNAL YESTERDAY THAT UPSET ME AND THEN JONATHAN WENT AWAY THIS MORNING TO STAY AWAY FROM ME A WHOLE DAY AND NIGHT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN PARTED SINCE OUR MARRIAGE
AND YET CLOUDS ROLL IN BEHIND THE LIGHT EVERY TIME BUT THAT YOU DO NOT CANNOT COMPREHEND OH BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU YOU SO CLEVER WOMAN MADAM HE SAID THIS VERY SOLEMNLY
WELL I SHALL TELL YOU MY THESIS IS THIS I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE TO BELIEVE WHAT TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT
AND NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN IT CAME TO SPEAKING TO THIS GREAT LEARNED MAN I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD THINK ME A WEAK FOOL AND JONATHAN A MADMAN
NOR IN HYPNOTISM YES I SAID CHARCOT HAS PROVED THAT PRETTY WELL HE SMILED AS HE WENT ON THEN YOU ARE SATISFIED AS TO IT YES
AND NOW HE SAID MAY I ASK YOU FOR SOME MORE HELP I HAVE A GREAT TASK TO DO AND AT THE BEGINNING IT IS TO KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME HERE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WENT BEFORE YOUR GOING TO TRANSYLVANIA
BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE JOKE WAS OVER AND I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED SO I TOOK THE TYPEWRITTEN COPY FROM MY WORKBASKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM FORGIVE ME I SAID I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT
SHE TRACES BY INFERENCE CERTAIN THINGS TO A SLEEP WALKING IN WHICH SHE PUTS DOWN THAT YOU SAVED HER IN GREAT PERPLEXITY THEN I COME TO YOU AND ASK YOU OUT OF YOUR SO MUCH KINDNESS TO TELL ME ALL OF IT THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER
MADAM MINA IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEAD I COME SIR I SAID YOU COULD HAVE NO BETTER CLAIM ON ME THAN THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND AND HELPER OF LUCY WESTENRA AND I HELD OUT MY HAND
SO THAT I MIGHT FAIRLY HAVE SAID THAT THE WOUND WHICH POOR LUCY LEFT ON ME WAS BECOMING CICATRISED EVERYTHING IS HOWEVER NOW REOPENED AND WHAT IS TO BE THE END GOD ONLY KNOWS
AND THE FEAR THAT HAS BEEN BROODING OVER ME EVER SINCE ALL CAME IN A TUMULT I SUPPOSE I WAS HYSTERICAL FOR I THREW MYSELF ON MY KNEES AND HELD UP MY HANDS TO HIM AND IMPLORED HIM TO MAKE MY HUSBAND WELL AGAIN
I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU IF YOU LIKE OH MADAM MINA I WILL BE GRATEFUL YOU WILL DO ME MUCH FAVOUR
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO
I HOPE TOO DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL NOT BLAME ME I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE AND ANXIETY OF LATE THAT I FEEL I CANNOT BEAR MORE JUST AT PRESENT I SUPPOSE A CRY DOES US ALL GOOD AT TIMES
HE MEANT THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND NOT LET A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH CHECK THE RUSH OF A BIG TRUTH LIKE A SMALL ROCK DOES A RAILWAY TRUCK WE GET THE SMALL TRUTH FIRST GOOD
I CAN TELL YOU I THINK DOCTOR VAN HELSING ALL ABOUT IT AH THEN YOU HAVE GOOD MEMORY FOR FACTS FOR DETAILS IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO WITH YOUNG LADIES NO DOCTOR BUT I WROTE IT ALL DOWN AT THE TIME
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER JONATHAN IS BETTER AFTER A BAD NIGHT I AM SO GLAD THAT HE HAS PLENTY OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT KEEPS HIS MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS
LETTER BY HAND VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER SIXTH O'CLOCK DEAR MADAM MINA I HAVE READ YOUR HUSBAND'S SO WONDERFUL DIARY YOU MAY SLEEP WITHOUT DOUBT STRANGE AND TERRIBLE AS IT IS IT IS TRUE
I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND IT IS NOT THE ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE THAT COULD CLOSE IT BUT THE STRANGE THINGS THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THE THINGS THAT MAKE ONE DOUBT IF THEY BE MAD OR SANE
LET ME ILLUSTRATE I HEARD ONCE OF AN AMERICAN WHO SO DEFINED FAITH THAT FACULTY WHICH ENABLES US TO BELIEVE THINGS WHICH WE KNOW TO BE UNTRUE FOR ONE I FOLLOW THAT MAN
SO I PRAY YOU IF IT MAY BE ENLIGHTEN HIM NOT LEST IT MAY HARM AGAIN YOUR PARDON AND FORGIVE ME VAN HELSING TELEGRAM MISSUS HARKER TO VAN HELSING
DO I READ YOUR LESSON ARIGHT AH YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE PUPIL STILL IT IS WORTH TO TEACH YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP TO UNDERSTAND
AND THRUST LAST NIGHT'S WESTMINSTER GAZETTE INTO MY HAND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE ASKED AS HE STOOD BACK AND FOLDED HIS ARMS I LOOKED OVER THE PAPER FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
HE TOOK IT AND SAID TENDERLY OH MADAM MINA I KNEW THAT THE FRIEND OF THAT POOR LILY GIRL MUST BE GOOD BUT I HAD YET TO LEARN HE FINISHED HIS SPEECH WITH A COURTLY BOW
YOUR HUSBAND IS NOBLE NATURE AND YOU ARE NOBLE TOO FOR YOU TRUST AND TRUST CANNOT BE WHERE THERE IS MEAN NATURE AND YOUR HUSBAND TELL ME OF HIM IS HE QUITE WELL
IF EVER ABRAHAM VAN HELSING CAN DO ANYTHING FOR YOU OR YOURS I TRUST YOU WILL LET ME KNOW IT WILL BE PLEASURE AND DELIGHT IF I MAY SERVE YOU AS A FRIEND AS A FRIEND BUT ALL I HAVE EVER LEARNED ALL I CAN EVER DO
AND BEGIN TRANSCRIBING THEN WE SHALL BE READY FOR OTHER EYES IF REQUIRED AND IF IT BE WANTED THEN PERHAPS IF I AM READY POOR JONATHAN MAY NOT BE UPSET FOR I CAN SPEAK FOR HIM
I ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT SO HE AT ONCE BEGAN I HAVE READ YOUR LETTERS TO MISS LUCY FORGIVE ME BUT I HAD TO BEGIN TO INQUIRE SOMEWHERE AND THERE WAS NONE TO ASK I KNOW THAT YOU WERE WITH HER AT WHITBY
AND LOCK MYSELF UP IN MY ROOM AND READ IT TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER I HADN'T THE HEART TO WRITE LAST NIGHT THAT TERRIBLE RECORD OF JONATHAN'S UPSET ME SO
IT WAS HALF PAST TWO O'CLOCK WHEN THE KNOCK CAME I TOOK MY COURAGE A DEUX MAINS AND WAITED IN A FEW MINUTES MARY OPENED THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I ROSE AND BOWED AND HE CAME TOWARDS ME
AND NEVER LET HIM BE TROUBLED OR WORRIED WITH IT AT ALL IF EVER JONATHAN QUITE GETS OVER THE NERVOUSNESS HE MAY WANT TO TELL ME OF IT ALL AND I CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT THINGS AND SEE HOW I MAY COMFORT HIM LETTER
I WILL PLEDGE MY LIFE ON IT IT MAY BE WORSE FOR OTHERS BUT FOR HIM AND YOU THERE IS NO DREAD HE IS A NOBLE FELLOW AND LET ME TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE OF MEN THAT ONE WHO WOULD DO AS HE DID IN GOING DOWN THAT WALL AND TO THAT ROOM AY AND GOING A SECOND TIME
OH MADAM MINA GOOD WOMEN TELL ALL THEIR LIVES AND BY DAY AND BY HOUR AND BY MINUTE SUCH THINGS THAT ANGELS CAN READ AND WE MEN WHO WISH TO KNOW HAVE IN US SOMETHING OF ANGELS EYES
AND REJECT THE THOUGHT READING LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT THERE ARE THINGS DONE TO DAY IN ELECTRICAL SCIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED UNHOLY BY THE VERY MEN WHO DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY
THAT AWFUL JOURNAL GETS HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION AND TINGES EVERYTHING WITH SOMETHING OF ITS OWN COLOUR OF COURSE IT IS ABOUT LUCY THAT HABIT CAME BACK TO THE POOR DEAR AND THAT AWFUL NIGHT ON THE CLIFF MUST HAVE MADE HER ILL
WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER
OR THINK THEY KNOW SOME THINGS WHICH OTHER MEN HAVE TOLD THEM AH IT IS THE FAULT OF OUR SCIENCE THAT IT WANTS TO EXPLAIN ALL AND IF IT EXPLAIN NOT THEN IT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN
THAT I HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME FOR FRIENDSHIPS BUT SINCE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED TO HERE BY MY FRIEND JOHN SEWARD I HAVE KNOWN SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE AND SEEN SUCH NOBILITY THAT I FEEL MORE THAN EVER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
IF IT SHOULD BE AND HE CAME TO LONDON WITH HIS TEEMING MILLIONS THERE MAY BE A SOLEMN DUTY AND IF IT COME WE MUST NOT SHRINK FROM IT I SHALL BE PREPARED I SHALL GET MY TYPEWRITER THIS VERY HOUR
AND NOT THINK ME FOOLISH THAT I HAVE EVEN HALF BELIEVED SOME VERY STRANGE THINGS HE REASSURED ME BY HIS MANNER AS WELL AS HIS WORDS WHEN HE SAID OH MY DEAR IF YOU ONLY KNOW HOW STRANGE IS THE MATTER REGARDING WHICH I AM HERE
BUT HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND POINTED OUT A PARAGRAPH ABOUT CHILDREN BEING DECOYED AWAY AT HAMPSTEAD IT DID NOT CONVEY MUCH TO ME UNTIL I REACHED A PASSAGE WHERE IT DESCRIBED SMALL PUNCTURED WOUNDS ON THEIR THROATS AN IDEA STRUCK ME AND I LOOKED UP
HE TOOK ME BY THE SHOULDER AND TURNED MY FACE ROUND TO THE LIGHT AND SAID AFTER A SHARP SCRUTINY BUT MADAM MINA TOLD ME YOU WERE ILL THAT YOU HAD HAD A SHOCK
IS ALL THAT FEVER GONE AND IS HE STRONG AND HEARTY I SAW HERE AN OPENING TO ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN SO I SAID HE WAS ALMOST RECOVERED BUT HE HAS BEEN GREATLY UPSET
A MAN OF MEDIUM WEIGHT STRONGLY BUILT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SET BACK OVER A BROAD DEEP CHEST AND A NECK WELL BALANCED ON THE TRUNK
IT WAS SO FUNNY TO HEAR MY WIFE CALLED MADAM MINA BY THIS KINDLY STRONG FACED OLD MAN I SMILED AND SAID I WAS ILL I HAVE HAD A SHOCK BUT YOU HAVE CURED ME ALREADY AND HOW
A THOUSAND THANKS FOR YOUR KIND LETTER WHICH HAS TAKEN A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY MIND AND YET IF IT BE TRUE WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT AN AWFUL THING IF THAT MAN THAT MONSTER
BE REALLY IN LONDON I FEAR TO THINK
HE SAID TO ME MISSUS HARKER IS IT NOT I BOWED ASSENT THAT WAS MISS MINA MURRAY AGAIN I ASSENTED IT IS MINA MURRAY THAT I CAME TO SEE THAT WAS FRIEND OF THAT POOR DEAR CHILD LUCY WESTENRA
THAT IS THE REASON OF HIS COMING IT IS CONCERNING LUCY AND HER SLEEP WALKING AND NOT ABOUT JONATHAN THEN I SHALL NEVER KNOW THE REAL TRUTH NOW HOW SILLY I AM
YOU WILL TELL ME OF HUSBAND JONATHAN'S TROUBLE SO FAR AS YOU CAN BUT NOT YET YOU MUST EAT NOW AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL AFTER LUNCH WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM HE SAID TO ME
IF I HAD NOT READ JONATHAN'S JOURNAL FIRST I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED EVEN A POSSIBILITY POOR POOR DEAR JONATHAN HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED
WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
MINA HARKER JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER I THOUGHT NEVER TO WRITE IN THIS DIARY AGAIN BUT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT MINA HAD SUPPER READY
AND THAT SUCH A THING IS HERE IN LONDON IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE WAVED HIS HAND FOR SILENCE AND WENT ON
THAT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN EXACTLY ALMOST EVERY WORD SPOKEN EVEN IF YOU HAD TO REFINE SOME OF IT AFTERWARDS HERE WAS A RARE INTERVIEW I SHALL TRY TO RECORD IT VERBATIM
IT IS THE COPY OF HIS JOURNAL WHEN ABROAD AND ALL THAT HAPPENED I DARE NOT SAY ANYTHING OF IT YOU WILL READ FOR YOURSELF AND JUDGE AND THEN WHEN I SEE YOU PERHAPS
I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE LUMBERING THROUGH A BOG IN A MIST JUMPING FROM ONE TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER IN THE MERE BLIND EFFORT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I AM GOING
THE HEAD IS NOBLE WELL SIZED BROAD AND LARGE BEHIND THE EARS THE FACE CLEAN SHAVEN SHOWS A HARD SQUARE CHIN A LARGE RESOLUTE MOBILE MOUTH A GOOD SIZED NOSE RATHER STRAIGHT BUT WITH QUICK SENSITIVE NOSTRILS
AND IF THEY BROUGHT HIM ALL THE WAY FROM HOLLAND TO LOOK AFTER LUCY I FEEL FROM HAVING SEEN HIM THAT HE IS GOOD AND KIND AND OF A NOBLE NATURE WHEN HE COMES TO MORROW I SHALL ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN
YOU ARE SO GOOD HE SAID AND MAY I READ IT NOW I MAY WANT TO ASK YOU SOME THINGS WHEN I HAVE READ BY ALL MEANS I SAID READ IT OVER WHILST I ORDER LUNCH AND THEN YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS WHILST WE EAT
AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU IS MUCH IN THIS AGE SO SCEPTICAL AND SELFISH AND YOU SIR I HAVE READ ALL THE LETTERS TO POOR MISS LUCY AND SOME OF THEM SPEAK OF YOU SO I KNOW YOU SINCE SOME DAYS FROM THE KNOWING OF OTHERS
HOW IN SOME ISLANDS OF THE WESTERN SEAS THERE ARE BATS WHICH HANG ON THE TREES ALL DAY AND THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN DESCRIBE AS LIKE GIANT NUTS OR PODS AND THAT WHEN THE SAILORS SLEEP ON THE DECK BECAUSE THAT IT IS HOT FLIT DOWN ON THEM AND THEN
TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER COME TO DAY BY QUARTER PAST TEN TRAIN IF YOU CAN CATCH IT CAN SEE YOU ANY TIME YOU CALL WILHELMINA HARKER MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER
THAT JOURNAL IS ALL SO STRANGE AND I HESITATED TO GO ON BUT HE WAS SO SWEET AND KIND AND HE HAD PROMISED TO HELP AND I TRUSTED HIM SO I SAID
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT VAN HELSING THINKS HE KNOWS TOO BUT HE WILL ONLY LET OUT ENOUGH AT A TIME TO WHET CURIOSITY HE WENT TO EXETER YESTERDAY AND STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT TO DAY HE CAME BACK AND ALMOST BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK
NOT KNOW YOU I WHO AM OLD AND WHO HAVE STUDIED ALL MY LIFE MEN AND WOMEN I WHO HAVE MADE MY SPECIALTY THE BRAIN AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO HIM AND ALL THAT FOLLOW FROM HIM
OR HAD HE SOME CAUSE FOR IT ALL I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW FOR I DARE NOT OPEN THE SUBJECT TO HIM AND YET THAT MAN WE SAW YESTERDAY HE SEEMED QUITE CERTAIN OF HIM POOR FELLOW
THAT IS TRUE INDIRECTLY BUT NOT DIRECTLY HOW DO YOU MEAN PROFESSOR I ASKED I WAS A LITTLE INCLINED TO TAKE HIS SERIOUSNESS LIGHTLY FOR AFTER ALL
VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER CONFIDENCE DEAR MADAM I PRAY YOU TO PARDON MY WRITING IN THAT I AM SO FAR FRIEND AS THAT I SENT TO YOU SAD NEWS OF MISS LUCY WESTENRA'S DEATH
QUINCEY WROTE ME A LINE TOO AND FROM HIM I HEAR THAT ARTHUR IS BEGINNING TO RECOVER SOMETHING OF HIS OLD BUOYANCY SO AS TO THEM ALL MY MIND IS AT REST AS FOR MYSELF I WAS SETTLING DOWN TO MY WORK WITH THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH I USED TO HAVE FOR IT
TILL ON DESCENDING HE COULD DRINK THE OIL OF ALL THE CHURCH LAMPS CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IN THE PAMPAS AY AND ELSEWHERE
BUT I SHALL GET THE BUNDLE OF PAPERS YOU CAN TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND READ THEM IN THE TRAIN AFTER BREAKFAST I SAW HIM TO THE STATION WHEN WE WERE PARTING HE SAID
JONATHAN WILL BE HERE AT HALF PAST ELEVEN AND YOU MUST COME TO LUNCH WITH US AND SEE HIM THEN YOU COULD CATCH THE QUICK THREE THIRTY FOUR TRAIN WHICH WILL LEAVE YOU AT PADDINGTON BEFORE EIGHT HE WAS SURPRISED AT MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRAINS OFF HAND
TO MAKE HIS LIFE STRONG AND MANLY AND YOUR LIFE A HAPPY ONE NOW YOU MUST EAT YOU ARE OVERWROUGHT AND PERHAPS OVER ANXIOUS HUSBAND JONATHAN WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE YOU SO PALE
I HAD A DIM IDEA THAT HE WAS TEACHING ME SOME LESSON AS LONG AGO HE USED TO DO IN HIS STUDY AT AMSTERDAM
UNLESS SOME SOLEMN DUTY COME UPON ME TO GO BACK TO THE BITTER HOURS ASLEEP OR AWAKE MAD OR SANE THERE SEEMS TO BE THROUGH IT ALL SOME THREAD OF CONTINUITY THAT FEARFUL COUNT WAS COMING TO LONDON
AND WHEN WE HAD SUPPED SHE TOLD ME OF VAN HELSING'S VISIT AND OF HER HAVING GIVEN HIM THE TWO DIARIES COPIED OUT AND OF HOW ANXIOUS SHE HAS BEEN ABOUT ME SHE SHOWED ME IN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT ALL I WROTE DOWN WAS TRUE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A NEW MAN OF ME
AND SO NOW WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT LEST IT DISTRESS I SHALL STAY IN EXETER TO NIGHT FOR I WANT TO THINK MUCH OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT I WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND THEN TOO
THAT SEEM TO BROADEN AS THE BIG BUSHY BROWS COME DOWN AND THE MOUTH TIGHTENS THE FOREHEAD IS BROAD AND FINE RISING AT FIRST ALMOST STRAIGHT AND THEN SLOPING BACK ABOVE TWO BUMPS OR RIDGES WIDE APART
THAT MAY BE MORE GREAT THAN YOU CAN KNOW MAY IT BE THAT I SEE YOU YOU CAN TRUST ME I AM FRIEND OF DOCTOR JOHN SEWARD AND OF LORD GODALMING THAT WAS ARTHUR OF MISS LUCY I MUST KEEP IT PRIVATE FOR THE PRESENT FROM ALL
MINA IS DRESSING AND I SHALL CALL AT THE HOTEL IN A FEW MINUTES AND BRING HIM OVER HE WAS I THINK SURPRISED TO SEE ME WHEN I CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
POOR DEAR HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR ONLY IMAGINATION I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN IT AT ALL DID HE GET HIS BRAIN FEVER AND THEN WRITE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
AND SO HAD ONLY TO KEEP ON WORKING IN WHAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE GROOVE OF MY LIFE THE GROOVE CEASED TO AVAIL ME AND I MISTRUSTED MYSELF DOCTOR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DOUBT EVERYTHING EVEN YOURSELF NO
AS WIZARDS THERE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIES IN LIFE
YOU WILL PARDON PRAISE FROM AN OLD MAN BUT YOU ARE BLESSED IN YOUR WIFE I WOULD LISTEN TO HIM GO ON PRAISING MINA FOR A DAY SO I SIMPLY NODDED AND STOOD SILENT
YOU DON'T YOU COULDN'T WITH EYEBROWS LIKE YOURS HE SEEMED PLEASED AND LAUGHED AS HE SAID SO YOU ARE PHYSIOGNOMIST I LEARN MORE HERE WITH EACH HOUR I AM WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE COMING TO YOU TO BREAKFAST AND OH SIR
IS AS SUNSHINE IT OPENS THE GATE TO ME
WE SHALL BOTH COME WHEN YOU WILL I SAID I HAD GOT HIM THE MORNING PAPERS AND THE LONDON PAPERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO START HE WAS TURNING THEM OVER HIS EYES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CATCH SOMETHING IN ONE OF THEM THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE
HE TOOK MY HANDS AND RAISED ME UP AND MADE ME SIT ON THE SOFA AND SAT BY ME HE HELD MY HAND IN HIS AND SAID TO ME WITH OH SUCH INFINITE SWEETNESS
BY THE KINDNESS OF LORD GODALMING I AM EMPOWERED TO READ HER LETTERS AND PAPERS FOR I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT CERTAIN MATTERS VITALLY IMPORTANT
I SUPPOSE SO HE STOOD UP AND SAID SOLEMNLY THEN YOU ARE WRONG OH WOULD IT WERE SO BUT ALAS NO IT IS WORSE FAR FAR WORSE
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHEN OTHER SPIDERS DIE SMALL AND SOON THAT ONE GREAT SPIDER LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE TOWER OF THE OLD SPANISH CHURCH AND GREW AND GREW
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOME ONE WHO RECALLED SOMETHING TERRIBLE SOMETHING WHICH LED TO HIS BRAIN FEVER AND HERE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO OVERWHELM ME IN A RUSH THE PITY FOR JONATHAN THE HORROR WHICH HE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE FEARFUL MYSTERY OF HIS DIARY
SHALL BE FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE
ALL THE REFORMED CHURCHES SCATTERED OVER ROMAN CATHOLIC KINGDOMS ACKNOWLEDGED CROMWELL AS THEIR GUARDIAN THE HUGUENOTS OF LANGUEDOC THE SHEPHERDS WHO IN THE HAMLETS OF THE ALPS PROFESSED A PROTESTANTISM OLDER THAN THAT OF AUGSBURG
TO WRING FROM HIM HIS CONSENT TO LAWS WHICH HE DISLIKED TO BREAK UP CABINETS TO DICTATE THE COURSE OF FOREIGN POLICY AND EVEN TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION OF WAR TO THE ROYAL OFFICE AND THE ROYAL PERSON THEY LOUDLY AND SINCERELY
FOR SO GREAT A PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED ABROAD THAT HE KNEW LESS OF THAT WORLD IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF ON HIS RETURN THAN MANY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS SONS FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS DISLIKED BY THE COMMONS
FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM
BUT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN THE CLOSET HE ON EVERY OCCASION EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT GENTLEMEN SO SINCERELY ATTACHED TO MONARCHY SHOULD UNADVISEDLY ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE MONARCH
UNLESS FAVOUR WERE SHOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD THE ENGLISH GUNS SHOULD BE HEARD IN THE CASTLE OF SAINT ANGELO IN TRUTH THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH CROMWELL HAD
GIRT WITH A SWORD OF STATE CLAD IN A ROBE OF PURPLE AND PRESENTED WITH A RICH BIBLE IN WESTMINSTER HALL HIS OFFICE WAS NOT DECLARED HEREDITARY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR AND NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE WOULD NAME HIS SON
A PESTILENCE SURPASSING IN HORROR ANY THAT DURING THREE CENTURIES HAD VISITED THE ISLAND SWEPT AWAY IN SIX MOUTHS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS AND SCARCELY HAD THE DEAD CART CEASED TO GO ITS ROUNDS
INCONSISTENT WITH THE OLD POLITY OF ENGLAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG ORATORS WHO WERE RISING TO DISTINCTION AND AUTHORITY IN THE LOWER HOUSE HIS DEPORTMENT WAS UNGRACIOUS AND HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THEM WITH SCARCELY AN EXCEPTION
BOTH OF CAVALIERS AND LEVELLERS THE LOYAL GENTRY DECLARED THAT THEY WERE STILL AS READY AS EVER TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THE OLD GOVERNMENT AND THE OLD DYNASTY IF THERE WERE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT TO RUSH
THE COURSE AFTERWARDS TAKEN BY MONK WAS NOT OPEN TO CROMWELL THE MEMORY OF ONE TERRIBLE DAY SEPARATED THE GREAT REGICIDE FOR EVER FROM THE HOUSE OF STUART WHAT REMAINED WAS THAT HE SHOULD MOUNT THE ANCIENT ENGLISH THRONE AND REIGN ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT ENGLISH POLITY
IT COULD IN NO WAY PROMOTE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IT INVOLVED US IN INGLORIOUS UNPROFITABLE
HAD BEEN DETESTED THE PURITAN BETRAYED AND EVIL ENTREATED
OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR
GONE TO THE FAVOURITES OF THE KING THE MINDS OF MEN WERE NOW IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT EVERY PUBLIC ACT EXCITED DISCONTENT CHARLES HAD TAKEN TO WIFE CATHARINE PRINCESS OF PORTUGAL
THAT THE RAGE OF THE POPULACE WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED HIS WINDOWS WERE BROKEN THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN WERE CUT DOWN AND A GIBBET WAS SET UP BEFORE HIS DOOR BUT NOWHERE WAS HE MORE DETESTED THAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
HIS PICTURE GALLERY FILLED WITH MASTERPIECES OF VANDYKE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE PROPERTY OF RUINED CAVALIERS HIS PALACE WHICH REARED ITS LONG AND STATELY FRONT RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE HUMBLER RESIDENCE OF OUR KINGS
EVEN WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT LIVING MUCH WITH MEN OF WIT AND PLEASURE HIS NATURAL GRAVITY AND HIS RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES HAD TO A GREAT EXTENT
AS THE ARMY WOULD BEAR THAT HIS ELEVATION TO POWER MIGHT NOT SEEM TO BE MERELY HIS OWN ACT HE CONVOKED A COUNCIL COMPOSED PARTLY OF PERSONS ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE COULD DEPEND AND PARTLY OF PERSONS WHOSE OPPOSITION HE MIGHT SAFELY DEFY
SINGULARLY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE HEALTH AND VIGOUR OF THE ENGLISH RACE BUT THE MURMURS EXCITED BY THESE ERRORS WERE FAINT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CLAMOURS WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN WAR WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES
THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES
BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THE CHARGES OF DUNKIRK FELL FAR SHORT OF THE SUMS WHICH WERE WASTED AT COURT IN VICE AND FOLLY IT SEEMED INSUPPORTABLE THAT A SOVEREIGN PROFUSE BEYOND EXAMPLE IN ALL THAT REGARDED HIS OWN PLEASURES
HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS
HE HAD CONSENTED TO PROFESS HIMSELF A PRESBYTERIAN
PROFESSED THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT BUT TO CLARENDON THEY OWED NO ALLEGIANCE AND THEY FELL ON HIM AS FURIOUSLY AS THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD FALLEN ON STRAFFORD THE MINISTER'S VIRTUES AND VICES ALIKE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS RUIN
YET WERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS STILL IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE VERY ARMY TO WHICH HE OWED HIS IMMENSE AUTHORITY THAT SINGULAR BODY OF MEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED OF ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS
AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED
WHO WISHED TO REPAIR THEIR RUINED FORTUNES
THE KING FEASTED WITH THE LADIES OF HIS SERAGLIO AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HUNTING A MOTH ABOUT THE SUPPER ROOM THEN AT LENGTH TARDY JUSTICE WAS DONE TO THE MEMORY OF OLIVER EVERYWHERE MEN MAGNIFIED HIS VALOUR
THE MARRIAGE WAS GENERALLY DISLIKED AND THE MURMURS BECAME LOUD WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THE KING WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE POSTERITY DUNKIRK WON BY OLIVER FROM SPAIN WAS SOLD TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH KING OF FRANCE
IN HIS PROSPERITY HAD CLAIMED BROTHERHOOD WITH HIM HUNTED FROM HIS HOME FORBIDDEN UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES TO PRAY OR RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT ACCORDING TO HIS CONSCIENCE YET STILL FIRM IN HIS RESOLUTION
ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS
THE PENAL LAWS HAD EFFECTUALLY PURGED THE OPPRESSED PARTY OF THOSE INSINCERE MEMBERS WHOSE VICES HAD DISGRACED IT AND HAD MADE IT AGAIN AN HONEST AND PIOUS BODY OF MEN THE PURITAN A CONQUEROR
ALL HIS REGAL DIGNITY AND CONFRONTING DEATH WITH DAUNTLESS COURAGE GAVE UTTERANCE TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS OPPRESSED PEOPLE MANFULLY REFUSED TO PLEAD BEFORE A COURT UNKNOWN TO THE LAW APPEALED FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
CROMWELL HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PUT TO HAZARD THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS PARTY THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS ARMY HIS OWN GREATNESS NAY HIS OWN LIFE IN AN ATTEMPT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN VAIN TO SAVE A PRINCE WHOM NO ENGAGEMENT COULD BIND
HAD REGARDED THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA WAS IT WISE MEN ASKED AT SUCH A TIME TO MAKE ANY ADDITION TO THE STRENGTH OF A MONARCHY ALREADY TOO FORMIDABLE DUNKIRK WAS MOREOVER PRIZED BY THE PEOPLE
OR A PRAYER MEETING AT HUNTINGDON HE SAW THAT SOME SCHEMES OF INNOVATION FOR WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN ZEALOUS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD IN THEMSELVES WERE OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE PERSEVERED IN THOSE SCHEMES HE HAD NOTHING BEFORE HIM
THE GREAT MAJORITY HOWEVER WERE DISPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL AS ELECTIVE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A COMMONWEALTH AGAINST ALL FACTIONS WHICH MIGHT RESIST HIS AUTHORITY
NO VESTIGE WAS LEFT THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT MADE LAWS FOR SCOTLAND ENGLISH JUDGES HELD ASSIZES IN SCOTLAND EVEN THAT STUBBORN CHURCH WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN AGAINST SO MANY GOVERNMENTS SCARCE DARED TO UTTER AN AUDIBLE MURMUR
SEIZED ONE OF THE FINEST WEST INDIAN ISLANDS AND ACQUIRED ON THE FLEMISH COAST A FORTRESS WHICH CONSOLED THE NATIONAL PRIDE FOR THE LOSS OF CALAIS SHE WAS SUPREME ON THE OCEAN SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST
AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
TO THE KINGLY OFFICE THAN TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST OR KING CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD SOON KISS THE HAND OF KING OLIVER THE PEERS WHO NOW REMAINED SULLENLY AT THEIR COUNTRY HOUSES
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS
WERE SUMMONED TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS TO LEGISLATE AT WESTMINSTER FOR EVERY PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES TO CREATE A HOUSE OF LORDS WAS A LESS EASY TASK DEMOCRACY DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF PRESCRIPTION
THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO SERIOUS AS THEY AFTERWARDS BECAME HAD ALREADY BEEN REMARKED BY FARSIGHTED MEN CROMWELL REFORMED THAT SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES ON WHICH MISTER PITT
PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR
THAT HE SHOULD SINK INTO A MERE LOUNGER AND VOLUPTUARY THAT THE GRAVEST AFFAIRS OF STATE SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AND THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE STARVED AND THE FINANCES DERANGED IN ORDER THAT HARLOTS AND PARASITES MIGHT GROW RICH
AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING
THAT HE OFFERED TO THE CHIEFS OF ILLUSTRIOUS FAMILIES SEATS IN HIS NEW SENATE THEY CONCEIVED THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCEPT A NOMINATION TO AN UPSTART ASSEMBLY
THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK
DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
HE HAD DURING THE THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED GONE THROUGH A POLITICAL EDUCATION OF NO COMMON KIND HE HAD BEEN A CHIEF ACTOR IN A SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS HE HAD BEEN LONG THE SOUL AND AT LAST THE HEAD OF A PARTY
TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS
A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS CREATED THAT TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCED CHARLES A TYRANT A TRAITOR A MURDERER AND A PUBLIC ENEMY AND HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS IN FRONT OF THE BANQUETING HALL
IN SPITE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF JEALOUS TRADERS AND FANATICAL THEOLOGIANS PERMITTED TO BUILD A SYNAGOGUE IN LONDON
WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE FATE OF HIS FATHER THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE STUARTS WAS REDUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PROFOUND SUBMISSION OF THAT INDEPENDENCE SO MANFULLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE MIGHTIEST AND ABLEST OF THE PLANTAGENETS
AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT ABUSED ITS VICTORY MADE THE REMISSION SPEEDY AND COMPLETE EVERY MODERATE MAN WAS SHOCKED BY THE INSOLENCE CRUELTY AND PERFIDY WITH WHICH THE NONCONFORMISTS WERE TREATED
AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE
THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED
ENCOMPASSED HIM THICK ON EVERY SIDE HAD HE BEEN A CRUEL LICENTIOUS AND RAPACIOUS PRINCE THE NATION MIGHT HAVE FOUND COURAGE IN DESPAIR AND MIGHT HAVE MADE A CONVULSIVE EFFORT TO FREE ITSELF FROM MILITARY DOMINATION
AT THE HEAD OF THEIR SERVING MEN AND TENANTS ON THE PIKES OF BRIGADES VICTORIOUS IN A HUNDRED BATTLES AND SIEGES WOULD BE A FRANTIC WASTE OF INNOCENT AND HONOURABLE BLOOD BOTH ROYALISTS AND REPUBLICANS
BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS READILY VOTED SUMS UNEXAMPLED IN OUR HISTORY SUMS EXCEEDING THOSE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED THE FLEETS AND ARMIES OF CROMWELL AT THE TIME WHEN HIS POWER WAS THE TERROR OF ALL THE WORLD
THE LORDS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSITION THAT THE KING SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEIR HOUSE WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED NO COURT KNOWN TO THE LAW WOULD TAKE ON ITSELF THE OFFICE OF JUDGING THE FOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN
IN A FEW MONTHS HE SUBJUGATED IRELAND AS IRELAND HAD NEVER BEEN SUBJUGATED DURING THE FIVE CENTURIES OF SLAUGHTER WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LANDING OF THE FIRST NORMAN SETTLERS
THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER
TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART
THE MOST FORMIDABLE POWER IN THE WORLD DICTATED TERMS OF PEACE TO THE UNITED PROVINCES AVENGED THE COMMON INJURIES OF CHRISTENDOM ON THE PIRATES OF BARBARY VANQUISHED THE SPANIARDS BY LAND AND SEA
HE COULD BE SAFE ONLY BY BEING ABSOLUTE THE FIRST HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH THE PEOPLE ELECTED BY HIS COMMAND QUESTIONED HIS AUTHORITY AND WAS DISSOLVED WITHOUT HAVING PASSED A SINGLE ACT HIS SECOND HOUSE OF COMMONS
COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE
TOOK OFF THE EDGE OF THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR REVENGE YET WAS THE ANGER EXCITED BY THE PROFUSION AND NEGLIGENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BY THE MISCARRIAGES OF THE LATE WAR BY NO MEANS EXTINGUISHED THE COUNSELLORS OF CHARLES
HOW OLIVER'S PARLIAMENTS WERE CONSTITUTED HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY OF LITTLE MOMENT FOR HE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND IN DEFIANCE OF THEIR OPPOSITION
AND TO THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES LATELY IN REBELLION AGAINST CHARLES THE FIRST NOW ACKNOWLEDGED THE AUTHORITY OF CHARLES THE SECOND BUT EVERYTHING YIELDED TO THE VIGOUR AND ABILITY OF CROMWELL
WIDELY AS THEY DIFFERED IN SPIRIT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT THEY YET HE SAID IMITATED THAT PARLIAMENT IN MEDDLING WITH MATTERS WHICH LAY BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THE ESTATES OF THE REALM
THE PROTECTOR WAS THEREFORE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF FILLING HIS UPPER HOUSE WITH NEW MEN WHO DURING THE LATE STIRRING TIMES HAD MADE THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS
VERY FEW UNREPRESENTED TOWNS HAD YET GROWN INTO IMPORTANCE OF THOSE TOWNS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WERE MANCHESTER LEEDS AND HALIFAX REPRESENTATIVES WERE GIVEN TO ALL THREE
ENCROACHING ON THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT THE GENTLEMEN WHO AFTER THE RESTORATION FILLED THE LOWER HOUSE THOUGH THEY ABHORRED THE PURITAN NAME
IN ADVANCED YEARS AND IN DECLINING HEALTH TO TURN LIBERTINE ON THE VICES OF THE YOUNG AND GAY HE LOOKED WITH AN AVERSION ALMOST AS BITTER AND CONTEMPTUOUS AS THAT WHICH HE FELT FOR THE THEOLOGICAL ERRORS OF THE SECTARIES
HIS WISH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TO GOVERN CONSTITUTIONALLY AND TO SUBSTITUTE THE EMPIRE OF THE LAWS FOR THAT OF THE SWORD BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT HATED AS HE WAS BOTH BY ROYALISTS AND PRESBYTERIANS
UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
ILL QUALIFIED TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GREAT MEN WHO THEN DIRECTED THE ARMS OF HOLLAND
BY MAKING THE ENGLISH AND PROTESTANT POPULATION DECIDEDLY PREDOMINANT FOR THIS END HE GAVE THE REIN TO THE FIERCE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAGED WAR RESEMBLING THAT WHICH ISRAEL WAGED ON THE CANAANITES SMOTE THE IDOLATERS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD
THAT THE TYRANT SUFFERED NONE BUT HIMSELF TO WRONG HIS COUNTRY AND THAT
AND WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN ALONE THE COUNTRY HE MAINTAINED WOULD NEVER BE WELL GOVERNED TILL THE KNIGHTS OF SHIRES AND THE BURGESSES WERE CONTENT TO BE WHAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF ELIZABETH
TO A PARTY BENT ON EFFECTING A COMPLETE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST BREAK IN PIECES EVERY PART OF THE MACHINERY OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THOSE WHO HAD ASSAILED AND UNDERMINED HIM BEGAN TO STRUGGLE FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS POWER
HAD THERE BEEN A GENERAL ELECTION WHILE THE NATION WAS SMARTING UNDER SO MANY DISGRACES AND MISFORTUNES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ROUNDHEADS WOULD HAVE REGAINED ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE BUT THE PARLIAMENT WAS STILL THE CAVALIER PARLIAMENT
HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
BUT HE WAS IN NO DANGER OF SUCH TREASON THOSE WHO HAD HIM IN THEIR GRIPE WERE NOT MIDNIGHT STABBERS WHAT THEY DID THEY DID IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTACLE TO HEAVEN AND EARTH AND THAT IT MIGHT BE HELD IN EVERLASTING REMEMBRANCE
DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE
AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
WAS NOT HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE NEIGHBOURING STATES AND WITH THE RESOURCES OF ENGLAND PROPERTY WAS SECURE EVEN THE CAVALIER WHO REFRAINED FROM GIVING DISTURBANCE TO THE NEW SETTLEMENT ENJOYED IN PEACE
WHATEVER THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD LEFT HEM THE LAWS WERE VIOLATED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PROTECTOR'S PERSON AND GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
A HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS A NECESSARY PART OF THE NEW POLITY IN CONSTITUTING THIS BODY THE PROTECTOR SHOWED A WISDOM AND A PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH WERE NOT DULY APPRECIATED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
A RULER A PERSECUTOR
THE KINGLY NAME AND DIGNITY THE SENTIMENTS OF CROMWELL WERE WIDELY DIFFERENT HE WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD BEEN
AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT
BEFORE THE RESTORER OF ARISTOCRACY A SENTIMENT OF LOYALTY WOULD GRADUALLY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW DYNASTY AND
UNDER THEIR INSPECTION AND CONTROL A SOLEMN AND MELANCHOLY COURT THIS MOCK ROYALTY WAS OF SHORT DURATION IN TWO GREAT BATTLES CROMWELL ANNIHILATED THE MILITARY FORCE OF SCOTLAND CHARLES FLED FOR HIS LIFE AND
WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
FOR TO EVERY DISTRESSED GENTLEMAN WHO HAD FOUGHT UNDER RUPERT OR DERBY HIS OWN SERVICES SEEMED EMINENTLY MERITORIOUS AND HIS OWN SUFFERINGS EMINENTLY SEVERE EVERY ONE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT WHATEVER BECAME OF THE REST
HIS DEADLY ENEMIES INDEED ONE OF HIS MOST SERIOUS FAULTS WAS AN INORDINATE CONTEMPT FOR YOUTH AND THIS CONTEMPT WAS THE MORE UNJUSTIFIABLE
WITH MANY STRUGGLES AND MISGIVINGS AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MANY PRAYERS THE DECISION WAS MADE CHARLES WAS LEFT TO HIS FATE THE MILITARY SAINTS RESOLVED THAT IN DEFIANCE OF THE OLD LAWS OF THE REALM
IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER
GENIUS AND PATRIOTISM EVERYWHERE IT WAS REMEMBERED HOW WHEN HE RULED ALL FOREIGN POWERS HAD TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF ENGLAND HOW THE STATES GENERAL NOW SO HAUGHTY HAD CROUCHED AT HIS FEET
WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ROUNDHEADS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND YET SUCH WAS HIS GENIUS AND RESOLUTION
HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH
IF THE ENEMY ADVANCED THE TOWER SHOULD BE ABANDONED GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE STREETS CRYING OUT THAT ENGLAND WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD THE HOUSES AND CARRIAGES OF THE MINISTERS WERE ATTACKED BY THE POPULACE
NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
TRULY HE IS WELL AND STURDY THE MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT HIM PROUDLY INDEED I HAVE BEEN ALMOST WISHING TODAY THAT HE WERE LIGHTER BY A FEW POUNDS
WHETHER TO INFORM HIS MASTER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE WAS HOWEVER BENT UPON HAVING AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND
THAT GEOFFREY WARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE NEEDED TO PUT OUT ALL HIS SKILL TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIS PUPIL BUT IT WAS NOT ALONE WITH GEOFFREY THAT WALTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE USE OF ARMS WHENEVER A SOLDIER RETURNED FROM THE WARS
THAT MATTER DID NOT TROUBLE ME I KNEW BETTER THAN TO BRING MONEY INTO THIS SWAMP OF YOURS WHEN I MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN RUFFIANS LIKE YOURSELF
THE TOWER WAS BUT HALF A MILE DISTANT BUT BEFORE MASTER ROGER ARRIVED WALTER HAD ALREADY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS
SEEING THAT HER KIND ENTERTAINERS WOULD BE HURT BY THE OFFER OF MONEY THE LADY CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THANKING MADGE WARMLY
LIKING BETTER TO HANG ABOUT TAVERNS DRINKING AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY RELATED FABULOUS TALES OF THE GALLANT ACTIONS THEY HAD PERFORMED MANY TOO WANDERED OVER THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES IN TWOS OR THREES SOMETIMES IN LARGE BANDS
THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
AND MY TWO MEN ARE HARD AT WORK MENDING ARMOUR AND FITTING SWORDS TO HILTS AND FORGING PIKE HEADS YOU SEE
IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD TAKE HIM SOME DAY AS HIS PARTNER IN THE FORGE AFTER WORK WAS OVER AND THE MEN HAD GONE AWAY
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY COME FROM A DISTANCE
IF ONE BOAT RUNS INTO ANOTHER NO ONE NEED BE SURPRISED
THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED
AND THEN HE HEARD RETURNING STEPS HE DREW ASIDE A FEW FEET AND CROUCHED DOWN SAW A DIM FIGURE PASS THROUGH THE MIST AND THEN RESUMED HIS WAY THE GROUND WAS FIRMER NOW AND REPLACING HIS SHOES HE WALKED BRISKLY ON
ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE
HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE AND WILL MAKE US A GREAT KING AND THE DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN A SHAME TO US ALL HOWEVER I MEDDLE NOT IN POLITICS IF THE POOR LADY DIES AS METHINKS IS WELL NIGH CERTAIN BERTHA AND I WILL BRING UP THE BOY AS OUR OWN
I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY WIFE AND SO FAR SHE AND I ARE NOT OF ONE MIND I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE OF HIS BIRTH AND LINEAGE SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BENEFIT HIM AND WILL BUT RENDER HIM DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
YOU COULD WISH FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO RIDE BEHIND THE PRINCE OF WALES HE IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS
MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS
LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
IT WAS A BITTERLY COLD NIGHT IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER THIRTEEN THIRTY THE RAIN WAS POURING HEAVILY WHEN A WOMAN
AND HIS WEIGHT HAS SORELY TRIED ME HIS NAME IS WALTER AND I TRUST SHE ADDED LOOKING AT THE POWERFUL FIGURE OF HER HOST THAT HE WILL GROW UP AS STRAIGHT AND AS STALWART AS YOURSELF
THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE
WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN IN THE MORNING I WILL GO FOR I HAVE A FRIEND WITHIN THE CITY WHO WILL METHINKS RECEIVE ME THE TONE OF VOICE AND THE ADDRESSING OF HIMSELF AS GOOD FELLOW AT ONCE CONVINCED THE MAN THAT THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM
THE KNOWLEDGE OF ARMS MAY WELL BE OF USE TO HIM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SUCH SKILL AS I HAVE I WILL TEACH HIM WHEN HE GROWS OLD ENOUGH TO WIELD SWORD AND BATTLE AXE AS YOU KNOW I MAY WITHOUT BOASTING SAY
HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE
IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW
IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID
BUT HIS FOLLOWERS WAVER
AND TWO OF THE PARTY TAKING OARS THEY STARTED UP THE RIVER NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE BENT ON WALTER SAID FROM SOME WORDS I OVERHEARD
UNTIL SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN GEOFFREY WARD RETURNED THE WOMAN WAS SITTING IN A SETTLE BY THE FIRESIDE DRESSED IN A WARM WOOLEN GARMENT BELONGING TO HIS SISTER MADGE HAD THROWN FRESH WOOD ON THE FIRE WHICH WAS BLAZING BRIGHTLY NOW
I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES
THAT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SHARE OF FIGHTING AS STARK AS THAT OF THE ASSAULT OF YON HEAP NOW MY LORDS LET US RIDE ON
WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH WALTER'S POSITION AMONG HIS COMRADES THE SKILL AND STRENGTH WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN WIELDING THE HAMMER AND BY PRACTICE WITH THE SWORD RENDERED HIM A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WITH THE STICKS WHICH FORMED THE WEAPONS IN THE MIMIC BATTLES
HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES
THE CRAFTSMAN CLOSED THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION INTO THE INNER ROOM MY LADY ALICE HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW TONE YOU HERE AND IN SUCH A GUISE SURELY IT IS I THE LADY SIGHED ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I AM WELL NIGH INCLINED TO ASK MYSELF
SEE THE BLOOD IS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE ONE WOULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO SEE THESE VARLETS OF THE CITY PLAYING SO ROUGHLY THE CITIZENS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES STURDY FIGHTERS BEFORE NOW MY PRINCE THE OTHER SAID THEY ARE EVER INDEPENDENT AND HOLD TO THEIR RIGHTS EVEN AGAINST THE KING
CITIZEN'S SON THOUGH HE BE MY LORD DE VAUX WILL YOU BID YOUR SQUIRE RIDE AT FULL SPEED TO THE TOWER AND TELL MASTER ROGER THE LEECH TO COME HERE WITH ALL HASTE
TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED I AM A WAYFARER THE WOMAN ANSWERED FEEBLY CANST TAKE ME AND MY CHILD IN FOR THE NIGHT
BELIEVING THAT YOU AND BERTHA WOULD TAKE ME IN AND SHELTER ME IN MY GREAT NEED AYE THAT WILL WE WILLINGLY GILES SAID WAS NOT BERTHA YOUR NURSE AND TO WHOM SHOULD YOU COME IF NOT TO HER BUT WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO MOUNT THE STAIRS FOR BERTHA WILL NOT FORGIVE ME IF I KEEP YOU TALKING DOWN HERE
HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
REACHED THE TOP OF THE HEAP WELL DONE THE YOUNG PRINCE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HIS HANDS SEE HOW HE LAYS ABOUT HIM WITH THAT CLUB OF HIS THERE HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN THE LEADER OF THE DEFENDERS AS IF HIS CLUB HAD BEEN A BATTLE AXE WELL DONE YOUNG SIR WELL DONE
IS ALWAYS HANDY IN TIMES LIKE THESE
OF HIS HISTORY NOT ENCOURAGING HIM TO HOPE TO RECOVER HIS FATHER'S LANDS AND MINE FOR THAT CAN NEVER BE SEEING THAT BEFORE THAT TIME CAN COME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENJOYED FOR MANY YEARS BY OTHERS BUT THAT HE MAY LEARN TO BEAR HIMSELF BRAVELY
YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE MASTER ROGER THE PRINCE SAID
WAS TAKEN ROLAND WAS KILLED AND I WAS CAST OUT WITH MY CHILD AFTERWARDS THEY REPENTED THAT THEY HAD LET ME GO AND SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE FOR ME BUT I WAS HIDDEN IN THE COTTAGE OF A WOODCUTTER
THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL
OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS
I HAVE PASSED THEM THE WOMAN SAID BUT ALL SEEMED FULL OF ROISTERERS I AM WET AND WEARY AND MY STRENGTH IS NIGH SPENT I CAN PAY THEE GOOD FELLOW AND I PRAY YOU AS A CHRISTIAN TO LET ME COME IN AND SLEEP BEFORE YOUR FIRE FOR THE NIGHT
THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN HUNTING DOWN OTHERS WHOM THEY PROCLAIMED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE KING AS THEY HAD WRONGFULLY SAID OF ROLAND WHO HAD BUT DONE HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY TO QUEEN ISABELLA AND WAS ASSUREDLY NO ENEMY OF HER SON
BUT WAS NOW A NARROW STRUCTURE OVER THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE RIVER UPON PIKES WERE A NUMBER OF HEADS AND HUMAN LIMBS THE LADY SHUDDERED AS SHE LOOKED UP
UNTIL THE OCCUPIERS OF THE ATTICS COULD WELL NIGH SHAKE HANDS ACROSS THEY SOON LEFT THE MORE CROWDED STREETS AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AFTER TEN MINUTES WALKING THE SMITH STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BOWYER SHOP NEAR ALDGATE
FOR NONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN HABITATION AMONG THESE BROWN DITCHES AND STAGNANT POOLS TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE LAD COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE HUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES CAME TO HIS EAR BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE
WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED
HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK
I THANK YOU INDEED SHE SAID FOR YOUR KINDNESS HAD YOU NOT TAKEN ME IN I THINK I WOULD HAVE DIED AT YOUR DOOR FOR INDEED I COULD GO NO FURTHER AND THOUGH I HOLD NOT TO LIFE YET WOULD I FAIN LIVE UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY BOY
MY FATHER IS TALKING OF APPRENTICING ME MASTER GEOFFREY WALTER SAID THAT EVENING I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AS YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO PROMISE TALK WITH HIM ABOUT APPRENTICING ME TO YOUR CRAFT RATHER THAN TO HIS I SHOULD NEVER TAKE TO THE MAKING OF BOWS
HE MOVES NOT LIFT HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND THE BOY WAS INDEED STILL INSENSIBLE MY LORDS THE PRINCE SAID TO THE KNIGHTS WHO HAD NOW RIDDEN UP I FEAR THAT THIS BOY IS BADLY HURT
FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT
THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER
AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM
AS SOON AS THE BOY COULD HANDLE A LIGHT TOOL GEOFFREY ALLOWED HIM TO WORK AND ALTHOUGH NOT ABLE TO WIELD THE HEAVY SLEDGE WALTER WAS ABLE TO DO MUCH OF THE FINER WORK
AND IT WAS SAID THAT MANY WHO WERE THOUGHT TO BE OF HER PARTY HAD BEEN ATTACKED AND SLAIN AND I HEARD AND THERE HE STOPPED YOU HEARD RIGHTLY GOOD GILES IT IS ALL TRUE A WEEK AFTER THE SLAYING OF MORTIMER
AS TO ARCHERY HE NEED NOT GO FAR TO LEARN IT SINCE YOUR APPRENTICE WILL PARKER LAST YEAR WON THE PRIZE AS THE BEST MARKSMAN IN THE CITY BOUNDS TRUST ME
THE CHILD AND MOTHER MADE SHE WAS A FAIR GENTLE LOOKING GIRL SOME TWO AND TWENTY YEARS OLD AND IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE NOW FROM HER DELICATE FEATURES AND SOFT SHAPELY HANDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TOIL AND NOW THE SMITH SAID
THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT
THAT HE COULD SCARCE HAVE A BETTER MASTER SEEING THAT I HAVE FOR THREE YEARS CARRIED AWAY THE PRIZE FOR THE BEST SWORD PLAYER AT THE SPORTS
AS YOU SEE HIS DISPOSITION AND MIND IF HE IS CONTENT TO SETTLE DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE HERE SAY NOUGHT TO HIM WHICH WOULD UNSETTLE HIS MIND BUT IF WALTER TURN OUT TO HAVE AN ADVENTUROUS DISPOSITION
BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM
INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WILL BE KIND TO HIM AND THIS WILL I TRUST BE TOMORROW SAY NOUGHT ABOUT IT GEOFFREY ANSWERED MADGE AND I ARE RIGHT GLAD TO HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE TO YOU
FOR THE LIGHT IS WANING FAST IT WERE ILL FOR ANYONE I CAUGHT PRYING ABOUT HERE BUT COME IN SIR KNIGHT MY HOVEL IS NOT WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP IS ACCUSTOMED TO BUT WE MAY AS WELL TALK THERE AS HERE BENEATH THE SKY THE TWO MEN DISAPPEARED FROM WALTER'S SIGHT THE LATTER
HE SAW A FIGURE MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE HOUR WAS ALREADY LATE AND THE NIGHT WAS FALLING AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USUAL DENIZENS OF THE SWAMP
GEOFFREY WAS FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC AND SAID WELL WALTER ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT THAT GAFFER GILES HEARD ME SAY SO I THINK YOU HAVE HAD A PIECE OF RARE GOOD FORTUNE
OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER
DID IT NOT STRIKE YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT IT MIGHT ENTER MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY ADVISABLE FOR ME TO FREE MYSELF FROM ONE WHO STANDS TOWARDS ME IN THAT RELATION
FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
IN VAIN HIS FOLLOWERS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO HIS RESCUE EACH TIME THEY STRUGGLED UP THE HEAP THEY WERE BEATEN BACK AGAIN BY THOSE ON THE CREST
WITH THE ESPECIAL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR WORTHY SELF WALTER COULD HEAR NO MORE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS SHOES AND FOLLOWED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND THEIR VOICES STILL ACTED AS A GUIDE TO HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP BUT HE FEARED TO KEEP TOO CLOSE
WHICH SHE NEEDS SORELY I WILL FETCH AN ARMFUL OF FRESH RUSHES FROM THE SHED AND STREW THEM HERE I WILL SLEEP IN THE SMITHY QUICK GIRL HE SAID SHARPLY
GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER
HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER
THAT WALTER SHOULD BE APPRENTICED TO HIM THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THE BOWYER INDEED WAS A QUIET MAN
MANY A FRIENDLY WRANGLE HAVE I HAD WITH HIM
SHE WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH WET AND HARDSHIP AND DOUBTLESS THEY TOOK ALL THE MORE EFFECT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOW IN SPIRIT AND WEAKENED WITH MUCH GRIEVING THAT NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SORT OF FEVER HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND AT TIMES OFF HER HEAD
AT ANY RATE WHETHER HE FOLLOWS YOUR TRADE
HITHERTO THE LADS ABSORBED IN THEIR STRIFE HAD PAID BUT LITTLE HEED TO THE PARTY OF ONLOOKERS BUT AT THE WORD
WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
THAT DID HE TAKE LESS PAINS HE WOULD THRIVE MORE BUT HE HANDLES EACH BOW THAT HE MAKES AS IF HE LOVED IT AND FINISHES AND POLISHES EACH WITH HIS OWN HAND THEREFORE HE DOETH NOT SO MUCH TRADE AS THOSE WHO ARE LESS PARTICULAR WITH THEIR WARES
THE LEECH POURED SOME CORDIAL FROM A VIAL INTO A SMALL SILVER CUP AND HELD IT TO THE BOY'S LIPS IT WAS POTENT AND NIGH TOOK HIS BREATH AWAY BUT WHEN HE HAD DRUNK IT HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET
HE AND HIS MASTER HAD A LONG BOUT TOGETHER WITH CUDGEL OR QUARTERSTAFF SWORD OR AXE
AND HIS LANDS LIKE THOSE OF SIR ROLAND HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE CROWN THE CHILD UPSTAIRS IS BY RIGHT HEIR TO BOTH ESTATES SEEING THAT HIS UNCLE DIED UNMARRIED
AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN WALTER HAD WON THE PRIZE AT THE SPORTS BOTH FOR THE BEST CUDGEL PLAY AND THE BEST SWORD AND BUCKLER PLAY AMONG THE APPRENTICES TO THE GREAT DISGUST OF MANY WHO HAD ALMOST REACHED THE AGE OF MANHOOD AND WERE JUST OUT OF THEIR TIME
URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD CEASE HE SAID AUTHORITATIVELY
AND NOW MADAM I AM AT YOUR SERVICE DURING THE NIGHT THE WAYFARER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN DRIED THE CLOAK WAS OF ROUGH QUALITY SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY A PEASANT WOMAN BUT THE REST THOUGH OF SOMBRE COLOUR WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL AND FASHION
THE WOMAN DRANK THE STEAMING BEVERAGE WHICH HER HOST BROUGHT WITH HIM
THE KNIGHT PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF UNCERTAIN OF HIS WAY
BUT SOME DAY MASTER GEOFFREY WHEN I HAVE SERVED MY TIME I MEAN TO FOLLOW THE ARMY THERE IS ALWAYS WORK THERE FOR ARMOURERS TO DO AND SOMETIMES AT A PINCH THEY MAY EVEN GET THEIR SHARE OF FIGHTING WALTER DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PREFER TO BE A MAN AT ARMS
THEY WERE CONTENT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE ONE DAY
BIDDING HIM IN CASE I CAME NOT BACK TO SET A HUE AND CRY ON FOOT
OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
WHOM GEOFFREY REPRESENTED AS BEING EAGER TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE SWORD AS WELL AS HOW TO MAKE IT THUS WALTER BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF FIGHTING
I AM ROUGH AND HEEDLESS IN SPEECH AS MY SISTER MADGE DOES OFTEN TELL ME AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHICH WOUNDED YOU
SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
SAY NOT MORE ABOUT IT I PRAY YOU THEY PASSED UNDER THE GATEWAY WITH ITS GHASTLY BURDEN AND WERE SOON IN THE CROWDED STREETS OF LONDON HIGH OVERHEAD THE HOUSES EXTENDED EACH STORY ADVANCING BEYOND THAT BELOW IT
AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN
TO TAKE TO MY CALLING IN WHICH HE MIGHT OTHERWISE
FOR TRAVELERS LIKE HERSELF OFTEN ARRIVED TOO LATE TO ENTER THE GATES AND HAD TO ABIDE OUTSIDE FOR THE NIGHT MOREOVER HOUSE RENT WAS DEAR WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CROWDED CITY AND MANY WHOSE BUSINESS BROUGHT THEM TO TOWN
AND IT WAS ON THEIR PETITIONS TO THE KING THAT THE SHERIFFS OF MIDDLESEX
THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED
AND IN TROTH MASTER WARD METHINKS THAT GOD WOULD DEAL MOST GENTLY WITH HER
YOU NEED NOT FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE ABOUT THE CHILD'S CALLING
I DON'T WANT TO BE TURBULENT WALTER SAID
WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
ARE THIS EVENING GOING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON A BOAT WITH A LADY IN IT COMING DOWN THE RIVER WE WILL BE ON THE SPOT
WON FOR HIMSELF THE PROUD POSITION OF CAPTAIN OF THE BOYS OF THE WARD OF ALDGATE GEOFFREY WARD HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO GIVE THE LAD LESSONS IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN NOT ENGAGED OTHERWISE WALTER WOULD ALMOST EVERY AFTERNOON
SHE FEEBLY MADE HER WAY INTO THE VILLAGE
WITH A BENT BOW IN HIS ARM TAKING AIM AT A SPOT IN THE WALL THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR THREE MEN COULD BE SEEN IN AN INNER WORKSHOP CUTTING AND SHAPING THE WOOD FOR BOWS THE BOWYER
TO THE FRIENDS WHOM YOU SEEK THAT IS SHOULD THEY BE KNOWN TO ME BUT IF NOT WE SHALL DOUBTLESS FIND THEM WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SO SAYING THE SMITH RETIRED TO HIS BED OF RUSHES IN THE SMITHY AND SOON AFTERWARDS THE TIRED VISITOR WITH HER BABY
HIS FRAME AND MUSCLES DEVELOPED WITH LABOUR AND HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SWING ALL SAVE THE VERY HEAVIEST HAMMERS IN THE SHOP HE HAD NEVER ABATED IN HIS PRACTICE AT ARMS AND EVERY DAY WHEN WORK WAS OVER
THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
THE CHILD WHO WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD WAS INDEED AN EXCEEDINGLY FINE LITTLE FELLOW AS HE SAT IN ONE SCANTY GARMENT IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP
THAT HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED THEIR USE AND GEOFFREY FORESAW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SHOULD HIS THOUGHTS TURN THAT WAY PROVE A MIGHTY MAN AT ARMS
HE HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE FIGHTS AND FROLICS OF HIS FORMER COMRADES HE WAS IN FACT FAR TOO TIRED AT THE END OF HIS DAY'S WORK TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO DO AUGHT BUT TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE TALES OF THE WARS
THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME
THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY
YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
WHEN THEY FOUND THE COUNTRY BECOMING TOO HOT FOR THEM THESE MEN WOULD TAKE SERVICE WITH SOME KNIGHT OR NOBLE GOING TO THE WAR ANXIOUS TO TAKE WITH HIM AS STRONG A FOLLOWING AS MIGHT BE AND NOT TOO PARTICULAR AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HIS SOLDIERS
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG
THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
THE LIGHTS CAME OUT BRIGHTLY FROM MANY OF THE CASEMENTS WITH SOUNDS OF BOISTEROUS SONGS AND LAUGHTER THE WOMAN PASSED THESE WITHOUT A PAUSE PRESENTLY SHE STOPPED BEFORE A COTTAGE FROM WHICH A FEEBLE LIGHT ALONE SHOWED THAT IT WAS TENANTED SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE AND SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS A KNIGHT
I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER
AND THE FIRE MUST BE ALIGHT AT DAYBREAK ON HIS WAY BACK
WALTER BEING OF AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS SOMETIMES WONT OF A SUMMER EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE TO WANDER ACROSS THE MARSHES TAKING WITH HIM HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND OFTEN BRINGING HOME A WILD DUCK OR TWO WHICH HE SHOT IN THE POOLS
TO A FELLOW CREATURE ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT FELLOW CREATURE IS A WOMAN WITH A CHILD POOR LITTLE CHAP HE LOOKS RIGHT WELL AND STURDY AND SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN NO ILL FROM HIS JOURNEY
AS BY THE LIGHT OF A FALLING LAMP ONE MIGHT MOMENTARILY SEE AN INSCRIPTION ON A WALL BEFORE BEING ENSHROUDED IN DARKNESS AND THEN THIS PASSING DISCRIMINATIVE POWER WAS WITHDRAWN
TO BEGUILE HIS LONELY WALKS BY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS THEREIN I HAVE READ TWO BOOKS OF THE ILIAD BESIDES BEING PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE SPEECH OF PHOENIX IN THE NINTH BOOK THE FIGHT OF HECTOR AND AJAX IN THE FOURTEENTH
BUTTER CHEESE COFFEE TEA
IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
PIGS WERE RATHER PLENTIFUL HEREABOUT BEING BRED AND FATTENED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF NORTH WESSEX ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WAS A STREAM WHENCE AS HE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZED HAD COME THE SLIGHT SOUNDS OF VOICES AND LAUGHTER
TILL HE PRENTICED HIMSELF AT ALFREDSTON SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN VERY STUCK UP AND ALWAYS READING HE WANTS TO BE A SCHOLAR THEY SAY OH I DON'T CARE WHAT HE IS OR ANYTHING ABOUT N DON'T YOU THINK IT MY CHILD OH DON'T YE
PLATO ARISTOTLE LUCRETIUS EPICTETUS SENECA ANTONINUS THEN I MUST MASTER OTHER THINGS THE FATHERS THOROUGHLY
WHEN IT BOILS STIR IN A HEAPED TABLE SPOONFUL OF THE ABOVE PREPARATION DISSOLVED IN A TEA CUP OF WATER KEEP STIRRING IT UNTIL IT BOILS AGAIN WHEN POUR IT OUT DRINK IT WITH SUGAR AND CREAM TO YOUR TASTE
WHAT DID YOU STAY TALKING TO HIM FOR IF YOU DIDN'T WANT UN WHETHER YOU DO OR WHETHER YOU DON'T HE'S AS SIMPLE AS A CHILD
THE ONLY COPIES HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAY HANDS ON WERE OLD DELPHIN EDITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERSEDED AND THEREFORE CHEAP
TWENTY SEVEN
IF YOU HAVE A SAFE TO KEEP IT IN IT NEED NOT BE COVERED CREAM TAKES MUCH LONGER TO RISE IN WINTER AFTER IT HAS STOOD TWO DAYS TO PUT IT ON THE TOP OF A MODERATELY HEATED STOVE WILL ASSIST IT WHEN IT IS HOT SET IT AWAY TO SKIM THE NEXT DAY
WHEN THE CREAM WILL BE THICK AND RICH AND CHURNS EASIER IF THE WEATHER IS VERY COLD AND THE CREAM HAS BEEN CHILLED HAVE A LARGE POT OF WATER OVER THE FIRE SET IN THE BUCKET WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING HEAT AND KEEP STIRRING TILL IT IS MILK WARM HAVE THE CHURN SCALDED AND PUT IT IN
AND JUDE WAS LOST TO ALL CONDITIONS OF THINGS IN THE ADVENT OF A FRESH AND WILD PLEASURE THAT OF HAVING FOUND A NEW CHANNEL FOR EMOTIONAL INTEREST HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THOUGH IT HAD LAIN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
TWENTY SIX
WHEN THE PICKLE IS ENTIRELY COLD POUR IT OVER AND PUT A PLATE ON THE TOP WITH A WEIGHT ON IT TO KEEP THE BUTTER UNDER TIE IT UP CLOSE AND KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE WHEN A ROLL IS WANTED TAKE IT OUT OF THE BAG AND SLICE IT OFF FOR TABLE USE
FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AN INCOME FROM ANY WORK IN PREPARING THE FIRST WOULD BE TOO MEAGRE FOR MAKING THE SECOND HE FELT A DISTASTE
AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT BECOME EVEN A BISHOP BY LEADING A PURE ENERGETIC WISE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE WOULD SET
MENG WU ASKED WHETHER TZU LU HAD LOVE
A LAND OF A THOUSAND CHARIOTS MIGHT GIVE YU CHARGE OF ITS LEVIES
WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING PUT IT IN THE TUB WITH THE NEW MILK AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT'S MILK IT SHOULD BE RATHER MORE THAN MILK WARM
WASH AND WIPE THE VAT PUT IN A CLEAN CLOTH AND TURN IN THE CHEESE UPSIDE DOWN
AND IT WILL BE FIT FOR USE IN LESS THAN A WEEK TO PREPARE RENNET FOR MAKING WHEY OR CHEESE WHEN THE RENNET IS TAKEN FROM THE CALF WASH IT LAY IT ON A PLATE WELL COVERED WITH SALT
OR IN A POT OF WATER THAT IS BOILING OVER THE FIRE WHEN THE WHEY HAS RISEN SUFFICIENTLY POUR IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND PUT THE CURD OR CHEESE AWAY IN A COLD PLACE AND JUST BEFORE GOING TO TABLE SEASON IT WITH SALT AND PEPPER TO YOUR TASTE AND POUR SOME SWEET CREAM OVER IT
BEGIN BY PUTTING A LAYER OF THE PRINTS IN THE BOTTOM OF A STONE POT PRESS THE BUTTER DOWN CLOSE SO THAT NO CAVITIES FOR THE ADMISSION OF AIR MAY REMAIN THEN STREW MORE OF THE MIXTURE OVER IT PROCEED IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE VESSEL IS FILLED
AND STIRRED IN THE COFFEE WHEN HALF COLD AND WELL MIXED THROUGH IT ARE SUFFICIENT TO CLEAR TWO POUNDS AND IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY OF USING EGGS IT WILL ANSWER EITHER FOR SUMMER OR WINTER
AND LIVE SUMPTUOUSLY FOR HIM ON THE REMAINDER WELL ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BISHOP WAS ABSURD HE WOULD DRAW THE LINE AT AN ARCHDEACON
LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS THOUGH THE FUTURE WERE THROWN THEREON BY A MAGIC LANTERN ON A SUDDEN SOMETHING SMACKED HIM SHARPLY IN THE EAR AND HE BECAME AWARE THAT A SOFT COLD SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN FLUNG AT HIM
THE MASTER SAID LOVE MAKES A SPOT BEAUTIFUL WHO CHOOSES NOT TO DWELL IN LOVE HAS HE GOT WISDOM TWO THE MASTER SAID LOVELESS MEN CANNOT BEAR NEED LONG THEY CANNOT BEAR FORTUNE LONG
WHICH WAS UTTERED VERY DISTINCTLY BY ARABELLA'S PERSONALITY HELD JUDE TO THE SPOT AGAINST HIS INTENTION ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL AND IN A WAY NEW TO HIS EXPERIENCE IT IS SCARCELY AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
AND WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF LABOUR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A TENDER HEARTED PEDAGOGUE SHED TEARS YET SOMEHOW GETTING AT THE MEANING OF WHAT HE READ AND DIVINING RATHER THAN BEHOLDING THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL
BY MEANS OF A STRAP ATTACHED TO THE TILT THE VOLUME HE WAS READING SPREAD THE DICTIONARY ON HIS KNEES AND PLUNGE INTO THE SIMPLER PASSAGES FROM CAESAR VIRGIL OR HORACE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE IN HIS PURBLIND STUMBLING WAY
THOUGH PROBABLY CONVENIENT ENOUGH TO HIMSELF WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A SAFE PROCEEDING FOR OTHER TRAVELLERS ALONG THE SAME ROADS THERE WERE MURMURS
ONCE THERE I SHALL SO ADVANCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE I SHALL THERE GET THAT MY PRESENT KNOWLEDGE WILL APPEAR TO ME BUT AS CHILDISH IGNORANCE I MUST SAVE MONEY AND I WILL AND ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES SHALL OPEN ITS DOORS TO ME
IT IS BEST TO HAVE ONE KETTLE OR BASKET TO PUT THE BUTTER IN THAT IS USED AT THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD FIVE OR SIX PLATES EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER IT CAN BE KEPT IN THIS WAY AS FIRM AND SWEET AS IN AN ICE HOUSE
MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
IT HAD BEEN NO VESTAL WHO CHOSE THAT MISSILE FOR OPENING HER ATTACK ON HIM HE SAW THIS WITH HIS INTELLECTUAL EYE JUST FOR A SHORT FLEETING WHILE
AS DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SALTS THEY CORRODE THE GLAZING AND THE BUTTER BECOMES RANCID AND UNHEALTHY A FRIEND OF MINE AND A LADY OF MUCH EXPERIENCE REMARKED ON READING THE ABOVE
AND HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET A GLANCE TOLD HIM WHAT IT WAS A PIECE OF FLESH THE CHARACTERISTIC PART OF A BARROW PIG WHICH THE COUNTRYMEN USED FOR GREASING THEIR BOOTS AS IT WAS USELESS FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
PUT MORE ON IN TWO DAYS KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT WILL DO TO STRETCH ON STICKS HANG IT UP IN A DRY COOL PLACE WITH AS MUCH SALT AS WILL STICK TO IT WHEN QUITE DRY PUT IT IN A PAPER BAG AND HANG IT UP
AS JUDE HAD TO GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO HEAT THE OVEN AND MIX AND SET IN THE BREAD THAT HE DISTRIBUTED LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAYING THE SPONGE SO THAT IF HE COULD NOT READ HIS CLASSICS ON THE HIGHWAYS
IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BY USING SEVERAL PANS SIX POUNDS OF COFFEE CAN THUS BE ROASTED AND BUT LITTLE TIME SPENT ON IT BOILING COFFEE A LARGE TEA CUPFUL OF UNGROUND COFFEE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIX PERSONS
PUT ABOUT TWO POUNDS IN A PAN STIR IT A FEW TIMES IT WILL ROAST GRADUALLY AND IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY BROWN FINISH IN A STOVE OR BEFORE THE FIRE
AND THEY SHOULD BE PAINTED ON THE OUTSIDE TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING WHEN THEY ARE PUT IN WATER IN SUMMER MILK SHOULD BE KEPT AS COOL AS POSSIBLE BEFORE IT IS STRAINED THE PANS AND STRAINER SHOULD BE RINSED WITH COLD WATER AND THE MILK NOT COVERED UNTIL IT IS COLD
SPRINGING TO HER FEET SHE SAID BRING BACK WHAT IS LYING THERE JUDE WAS NOW AWARE THAT NO MESSAGE ON ANY MATTER CONNECTED WITH HER FATHER'S BUSINESS HAD PROMPTED HER SIGNAL TO HIM HE SET DOWN HIS BASKET OF TOOLS
CERTAINLY THERE SEEMED LITTLE HARMONY BETWEEN THIS PAGAN LITERATURE AND THE MEDIAEVAL COLLEGES AT CHRISTMINSTER THAT ECCLESIASTICAL ROMANCE IN STONE
NO MORE NO LESS AND JUDE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO HER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE THE ENTERPRISE OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM DREAMS OF THE HUMANER LETTERS TO WHAT WAS SIMMERING IN THE MINDS AROUND HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE TOLD
FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG BUT HAD SOMEHOW BEEN DIVIDED FROM HIS ACTUAL BREATHING AS BY A SHEET OF GLASS THE INTENTIONS AS TO READING WORKING AND LEARNING WHICH HE HAD SO PRECISELY FORMULATED ONLY A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
CH'ANG IS PASSIONATE HOW CAN HE BE FIRM ELEVEN TZU KUNG SAID
IT SHOULD BE PUT ON LITTLE PLATES AND EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER TO EXCLUDE THE AIR IF THE BUTTER IS GOOD WHEN PUT UP IN THE FALL IT WILL KEEP TILL YOU CAN GET GRASS BUTTER IN THE SPRING THE JARS FOR THIS PURPOSE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED FOR PICKLES
TO THREE GALLONS OF WATER ADD FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS OF GOOD BROWN SUGAR ONE AND A HALF OUNCES OF SALTPETRE ONE OUNCE OF SALAERATUS PUT THEM INTO AN IRON POT AND LET THEM COME TO A BOIL TAKE OFF THE SCUM WHEN COLD IT IS READY FOR USE
SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU DO ARABELLA DONN I'M LIVING HERE I MUST HAVE KNOWN IT IF I HAD OFTEN COME THIS WAY BUT I MOSTLY GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MY FATHER IS A PIG BREEDER
HE INCLINED TO THEY BUILT IN A CITY THEREFORE HE WOULD LEARN TO BUILD HE THOUGHT OF HIS UNKNOWN UNCLE HIS COUSIN SUSANNA'S FATHER AN ECCLESIASTICAL WORKER IN METAL AND SOMEHOW
AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
AND JUST COME TO A BOIL STIR IT AND DO NOT LET IT BOIL OVER LET IT KEEP AT BOILING HEAT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE AND PUT IN HALF A TEA CUP OF WATER TO SETTLE IT LET IT STAND FIVE MINUTES AND POUR IT OFF
MANY PERSONS USE COFFEE ROASTERS BUT SOME OLD EXPERIENCED HOUSEKEEPERS THINK THAT THE FINE FLAVOR FLIES OFF MORE THAN WHEN DONE IN A DUTCH OVEN AND CONSTANTLY STIRRED IF YOU ARE CAREFUL IT CAN BE DONE VERY WELL IN THE DRIPPING PAN OF A STOVE
HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE TOLERABLE TO HIS CRUSTY MAIDEN AUNT BY ASSISTING HER TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY AND THE BUSINESS OF THE LITTLE COTTAGE BAKERY HAD GROWN IN CONSEQUENCE
THAT HAD MINGLED WITH HIS DREAMS HE MOUNTED THE BANK AND LOOKED OVER THE FENCE ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM STOOD A SMALL HOMESTEAD HAVING A GARDEN AND PIG STIES ATTACHED IN FRONT OF IT BESIDE THE BROOK
PUT A WEIGHT ON THE TOP HEAVY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE WHEY DRAIN OUT GRADUALLY IN SIX OR SEVEN HOURS IT WILL BE READY TO TAKE OUT OF THE PRESS WHEN RUB IT OVER WITH FINE SALT SET IT IN A DRY DARK PLACE CHANGE IT FROM ONE PLATE TO ANOTHER TWICE A DAY
IF YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KEEPING YOUR CREAM COOL IN HOT WEATHER IT OUGHT TO BE CHURNED TWICE A WEEK THE EARLIER IN THE MORNING THE BETTER ALWAYS PUT COLD WATER IN YOUR CHURN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU USE IT AND CHANGE IT IN THE MORNING JUST BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM
WHOEVER DID IT WAS WASTEFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY OH THAT'S NOTHING BUT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME I SUPPOSE OH YES IF YOU LIKE TO
THREE THE MASTER SAID
THE MASTER SAID A MAN AND HIS FAULTS ARE OF A PIECE BY WATCHING HIS FAULTS WE LEARN WHETHER LOVE BE HIS EIGHT THE MASTER SAID
THE MOUNTAIN WEIGHT OF MATERIAL UNDER WHICH THE IDEAS LAY IN THOSE DUSTY VOLUMES CALLED THE CLASSICS PIQUED HIM INTO A DOGGED MOUSELIKE SUBTLETY OF ATTEMPT TO MOVE IT PIECEMEAL
IT WAS THEN VERY SWEET AND GOOD IT WILL NOT DO TO USE FOR A MONTH BECAUSE EARLIER THE SALTS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY BLENDED WITH IT IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN WOODEN VESSELS OR NICE STONE JARS EARTHEN WARE JARS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR BUTTER
PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTINACIES AS HE NOW KNEW THEM INHERENTLY TO POSSESS WAS A HERCULEAN PERFORMANCE WHICH GRADUALLY LED HIM ON TO A GREATER INTEREST IN IT THAN IN THE PRESUPPOSED PATENT PROCESS
SHE BROUGHT AS BY MAGIC UPON ITS SMOOTH AND ROTUND SURFACE A PERFECT DIMPLE WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THERE AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE THIS PRODUCTION OF DIMPLES AT WILL
SPREAD A THIN LINEN CLOTH OVER THE TOP AND AS THE WHEY RISES DIP IT OFF WITH A SAUCER PUT THE CURD AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE INTO A CHEESE HOOP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DINNER PLATE FIRST SPREADING A WET CLOTH INSIDE THEN FOLD THE CLOTH SMOOTHLY OVER THE TOP
THEN TO THE DISAPPEARING LUMINARY ON THE OTHER HAND AS HE BEGAN PHOEBE
OR HATE OTHERS FOUR THE MASTER SAID
FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERY THING CONNECTED WITH MILK AND BUTTER SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN IF THE MILK ACQUIRES AN UNPLEASANT TASTE IT COMMUNICATES IT TO THE BUTTER TIN PANS ARE BEST TO KEEP MILK IN
THE SAME PIECE SALTED AND DRIED WILL DO SEVERAL TIMES COTTAGE CHEESE OR SMEARCASE
SHALL I CALL YES SHE BRIGHTENED WITH A LITTLE GLOW OF TRIUMPH SWEPT HIM ALMOST TENDERLY WITH HER EYES IN TURNING AND RETRACING HER STEPS DOWN THE BROOKSIDE GRASS REJOINED HER COMPANIONS
THREE YOUNG WOMEN WERE KNEELING WITH BUCKETS AND PLATTERS BESIDE THEM CONTAINING HEAPS OF PIGS CHITTERLINGS WHICH THEY WERE WASHING IN THE RUNNING WATER
OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
WAS A NOT UNKNOWN OPERATION WHICH MANY ATTEMPTED BUT ONLY A FEW SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THEY MET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLANK AND JUDE TOSSING BACK HER MISSILE SEEMED TO EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAD AUDACIOUSLY STOPPED HIM BY THIS NOVEL ARTILLERY
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
WHEN THE BUTTER IS GATHERING TAKE OFF THE LID OF THE CHURN TO LET THE HEATED AIR ESCAPE AND MOVE IT GENTLY HAVE YOUR BUTTER LADLE AND PAN SCALDED AND COOLED TAKE OUT THE BUTTER AND WORK IT TILL ALL THE MILK IS OUT SCRAPE SOME LUMPS OF SALT AND WORK IN
USE ONE OUNCE OF THIS COMPOSITION TO EVERY POUND OF BUTTER WORK IT WELL INTO THE MASS BUTTER CURED IN THIS WAY IT IS SAID WILL KEEP GOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE NEVER KEPT IT LONGER THAN FROM THE FALL UNTIL LATE IN THE SPRING
AND A LOT OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT I WISH THERE WAS ONLY ONE DIALECT ALL THE SAME I HAVE DONE SOME MATHEMATICS INCLUDING THE FIRST SIX AND THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH BOOKS OF EUCLID AND ALGEBRA AS FAR AS SIMPLE EQUATIONS I KNOW SOMETHING OF THE FATHERS
I DIDN'T THROW IT I TELL YOU ASSERTED ONE GIRL TO HER NEIGHBOUR AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE NOR I THE SECOND ANSWERED OH ANNY HOW CAN YOU SAID THE THIRD
INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
UNLESS THEY TAKE IT VERY STRONG WHICH IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH GRIND IT AND PUT IT IN THE TIN POT WITH HALF A TEA CUP OF COLD WATER AND THE WHITE OF HALF AN EGG SHAKE IT TILL IT IS MIXED THEN POUR BOILING WATER ON IT AND LET IT STAND CLOSE TO THE FIRE
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
AS ANOTHER OUTCOME OF THIS CHANGE OF GROOVE HE VISITED ON SUNDAYS ALL THE CHURCHES WITHIN A WALK AND DECIPHERED THE LATIN INSCRIPTIONS ON FIFTEENTH CENTURY BRASSES AND TOMBS ON ONE OF THESE PILGRIMAGES
AND REPEATING THE ODD LITTLE SUCKING OPERATION BEFORE MENTIONED JUDE BEING STILL UNCONSCIOUS OF MORE THAN A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER APPEARANCE NEXT SUNDAY HE HAZARDED TO MORROW THAT IS YES
HE STOPPED THE HORSE ALIGHTED AND GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS IN SIGHT KNELT DOWN ON THE ROADSIDE BANK WITH OPEN BOOK HE TURNED FIRST TO THE SHINY GODDESS WHO SEEMED TO LOOK SO SOFTLY AND CRITICALLY AT HIS DOINGS
CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO
YOU MAY MAKE CHEESE TWICE A WEEK AND STILL HAVE BUTTER FOR THE FAMILY YOU SHOULD KEEP FOUR THIN CLOTHS ON PURPOSE FOR CHEESE PENNSYLVANIA CREAM CHEESE THE CHEESE CALLED BY THIS NAME IS NOT IN REALITY MADE OF CREAM
WHEN HE CONSIDERED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE NOW AND THEN AS HE WENT ALONG HE TURNED TO FACE THE PEEPS OF COUNTRY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM BUT HE HARDLY SAW THEM THE ACT WAS AN AUTOMATIC REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN LESS OCCUPIED
A MAN BEGGED HIM FOR VINEGAR
A LARGE CHURNING MAY BE MORE EFFECTUALLY CLEARED OF THE BUTTER MILK IN A FEW MINUTES THAN IN THE OLD WAY IN AN HOUR BY DOING IT QUICKLY IT DOES NOT GET SOFT AND OILY IN HOT WEATHER A PICKLE FOR BUTTER
AT THIS MEMORABLE DATE OF HIS LIFE HE WAS ONE SATURDAY RETURNING FROM ALFREDSTON TO MARYGREEN ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS FINE WARM AND SOFT SUMMER WEATHER AND HE WALKED WITH HIS TOOLS AT HIS BACK
WHEN PUT ON THE TOP A SMALL MUSLIN BAG FILLED WITH SALT AND TIE THE JAR UP CLOSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE BUTTER IN A COOL PLACE A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON THE BUTTER BEING WELL WORKED PERSONS THAT HAVE LARGE DAIRIES SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MACHINE TO WORK IT
HAVING PROMISED TO CALL AT A FLOUR MILL NEAR CRESSCOMBE TO EXECUTE A COMMISSION FOR HIS AUNT HE WAS IN AN ENTHUSIASTIC MOOD HE SEEMED TO SEE HIS WAY TO LIVING COMFORTABLY IN CHRISTMINSTER IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO AND KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF ONE OF THOSE STRONGHOLDS OF LEARNING
AND SOMETHING OF ROMAN AND ENGLISH HISTORY THESE THINGS ARE ONLY A BEGINNING BUT I SHALL NOT MAKE MUCH FARTHER ADVANCE HERE FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING BOOKS HENCE I MUST NEXT CONCENTRATE ALL MY ENERGIES ON SETTLING IN CHRISTMINSTER
AS A WOMAN IS SINGLED OUT IN SUCH CASES FOR NO REASONED PURPOSE OF FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE BUT IN COMMONPLACE OBEDIENCE TO CONJUNCTIVE ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS
I ONLY KNOW THE LETTERS AS YET HOITY TOITY BUT I CAN WORK HARD I HAVE STAYING POWER IN ABUNDANCE THANK GOD AND IT IS THAT WHICH TELLS YES CHRISTMINSTER SHALL BE MY ALMA MATER
WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
I HAVE ACQUIRED QUITE AN AVERAGE STUDENT'S POWER TO READ THE COMMON ANCIENT CLASSICS LATIN IN PARTICULAR
THAT TILL THIS MOMENT JUDE HAD NEVER LOOKED AT A WOMAN TO CONSIDER HER AS SUCH BUT HAD VAGUELY REGARDED THE SEX AS BEINGS OUTSIDE HIS LIFE AND PURPOSES HE GAZED FROM HER EYES TO HER MOUTH THENCE TO HER BOSOM AND TO HER FULL ROUND NAKED ARMS
JUDE ASKED POLITELY ACCEPTING HER ASSERTION THOUGH HE HAD VERY LARGE DOUBTS AS TO ITS TRUTH IMPUDENCE DON'T TELL FOLK IT WAS I MIND HOW CAN I I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME AH NO
HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IMPROVED BY IT BEFORE POURING OUT TEA IT SHOULD BE STIRRED WITH A SPOON THAT THE STRENGTH OF EACH CUP MAY BE ALIKE MILK IS THE BEST DRINK FOR CHILDREN BUT IF THAT CANNOT BE HAD SWEETENED WATER WITH A LITTLE MILK WILL DO
BUT CAPABLE OF PASSING AS SUCH AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DESPITE SOME COARSENESS OF SKIN AND FIBRE SHE HAD A ROUND AND PROMINENT BOSOM FULL LIPS PERFECT TEETH AND THE RICH COMPLEXION OF A COCHIN HEN'S EGG SHE WAS A COMPLETE AND SUBSTANTIAL FEMALE ANIMAL
AN AGED HORSE WITH A HANGING HEAD HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR EIGHT POUNDS AT A SALE A CREAKING CART WITH A WHITY BROWN TILT OBTAINED FOR A FEW POUNDS MORE AND IN THIS TURN OUT IT BECAME JUDE'S BUSINESS THRICE A WEEK TO CARRY LOAVES OF BREAD TO THE VILLAGERS
AND THAT HE WAS WATCHING THEM THEY BRACED THEMSELVES FOR INSPECTION BY PUTTING THEIR MOUTHS DEMURELY INTO SHAPE AND RECOMMENCING THEIR RINSING OPERATIONS WITH ASSIDUITY THANK YOU SAID JUDE SEVERELY
WE ARE DOING THIS FOR MY FATHER WHO NATURALLY DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING THROWN AWAY HE MAKES THAT INTO DUBBIN SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE FRAGMENT ON THE GRASS WHAT MADE EITHER OF THE OTHERS THROW IT I WONDER
ONE GOOD WORKING ANSWERS VERY WELL FOR BUTTER IN WINTER ALWAYS SCALD THE CHURN BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM IN COLD WEATHER TO PUT UP BUTTER FOR WINTER WORK IT WELL AND SALT IT RATHER MORE THAN FOR TABLE USE
SHALL WELCOME WHOM NOW IT WOULD SPURN IF I WAIT TWENTY YEARS FOR THE WELCOME I'LL BE D D BEFORE I HAVE DONE
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
THE APPEARANCE OF ACHILLES UNARMED AND HIS HEAVENLY ARMOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE FUNERAL GAMES IN THE TWENTY THIRD
AND I'LL BE HER BELOVED SON IN WHOM SHE SHALL BE WELL PLEASED IN HIS DEEP CONCENTRATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUTURE JUDE'S WALK HAD SLACKENED AND HE WAS NOW STANDING QUITE STILL
SHE SAID PIQUANTLY I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HE ANSWERED THAT'S FOR YOU TO THINK ON THERE'S NOBODY AFTER ME JUST NOW THOUGH THERE MED BE IN A WEEK OR TWO SHE HAD SPOKEN THIS WITHOUT A SMILE AND THE DIMPLES DISAPPEARED
AN ADROIT LITTLE SUCK TO THE INTERIOR OF EACH OF HER CHEEKS IN SUCCESSION
AND INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE CONSTABLE'S DUTY TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT AND TAKE HIM TO THE POLICE COURT AT ALFREDSTON AND GET HIM FINED FOR DANGEROUS PRACTICES ON THE HIGHWAY THE POLICEMAN THEREUPON LAY IN WAIT FOR JUDE AND ONE DAY ACCOSTED HIM AND CAUTIONED HIM
AND THEN YOU COULD ALL COME AND LIVE WITH ME AND WE WOULD PLAY IN THE GARDEN AND DORRY SHOULD HAVE TURKEY FIVE TIMES A DAY IF HE LIKED AND WE'D HAVE A MACHINE TO DARN THE STOCKINGS AND ANOTHER MACHINE TO PUT THE BUREAU DRAWERS IN ORDER
WE WANT TO GO BY SASSAFRAS PATH CRIED JOHN AND DORRY HOWEVER KATY AS USUAL HAD HER WAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST TRY PILGRIM'S PATH AND AFTERWARD MAKE A THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF THE WHOLE OF THEIR LITTLE KINGDOM
IT WAS A HOT DAY THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED THEM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES I GOT UP FROM MY SEAT TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE SPEAKERS AND SURE ENOUGH THERE ON ONE OF THE CAT TAIL BULRUSHES I SPIED TWO TINY PALE GREEN CREATURES
PEOPLE VERY OFTEN SAY AFTERWARD THAT THEY ALWAYS KNEW CONCLUDED KATY SAGACIOUSLY OH KATY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WILL BE SAID CLOVER CLASPING HER HANDS CLOVER BELIEVED IN KATY AS SHE DID IN THE BIBLE
AND OPENING HIS BIG MOUTH
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
THERE WAS A GENERAL SHOUT EVEN DEMURE CECY WAS PLEASED AND DORRY AND JOHN KICKED THEIR HEELS ON THE GROUND IN A TUMULT OF JOY SEVEN PAIRS OF HANDS WERE HELD OUT AT ONCE TOWARD THE BASKET
FORGIT WHAT DID GRIDEL CAKES FOR BREKFAST DEBBY DIDN'T FRY ENUFF
BUT JOHNNIE HAD NO CLEAR IDEAS AS TO HER FUTURE SHE LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL AND SQUEEZED DORRY'S ARM VERY TIGHT BUT THAT WAS ALL DORRY WAS MORE EXPLICIT I MEAN TO HAVE TURKEY EVERY DAY HE DECLARED
LEFT BEHIND WOULD CRY BITTER TEARS AND AS SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO PLAY MUCH WITH DORRY AND JOHN HER PRINCIPAL COMFORT WAS TRACKING THE OLDER ONES ABOUT AND DISCOVERING THEIR MYSTERIES ESPECIALLY THE POST OFFICES
WHICH HUNG ALMOST OVER THE CHILDREN'S HEADS LET'S PLAY WE'RE GROWN UP SAID CECY AND TELL WHAT WE MEAN TO DO WELL SAID CLOVER YOU BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO
HE SPOKE WITH A SLOBBERING ARTICULATION WITH THE GHOST OF A LISP WHAT SHIP IS THIS I SAID SLOWLY HOARSE FROM MY LONG SILENCE IT'S A LITTLE TRADER FROM ARICA AND CALLAO
THAN ALICE LISLE THAN WILLIAM HEWLING THAN ANY OF THE HUNDREDS OF IGNORANT PEASANTS WHOSE SKULLS AND QUARTERS WERE EXPOSED IN SOMERSETSHIRE BUT GREY'S ESTATE WAS LARGE AND WAS STRICTLY ENTAILED HE HAD ONLY A LIFE INTEREST IN HIS PROPERTY
WHO DON'T MIND GETTING THEIR FEET WET BUT IN SUMMER THE WATER DRIED AWAY AND THEN IT WAS ALL FRESH AND GREEN AND FULL OF DELIGHTFUL THINGS WILD ROSES AND SASSAFRAS AND BIRDS NESTS
THREE HELPS IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR A LITTLE BOY OH DORRY YOU PIG CRIED KATY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED WITH LAUGHTER DORRY WAS MUCH AFFRONTED I SHALL JUST GO AND TELL AUNT IZZIE WHAT YOU CALLED ME HE SAID
YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
HE HAD WATERY GREY EYES ODDLY VOID OF EXPRESSION THEN JUST OVERHEAD
LIKE CECY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BUT EVERY SUNDAY I'LL GO AND STAND BY THE GATE AND WHEN HER SCHOLARS GO BY ON THEIR WAY HOME
IT MAY BE DISTINCTLY TRACED IN EVERY CASE EITHER TO A SORDID OR TO A MALIGNANT MOTIVE EITHER TO THIRST FOR MONEY OR TO THIRST FOR BLOOD IN THE CASE OF GREY THERE WAS NO MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE HIS PARTS AND KNOWLEDGE
THE WINDOW ABOVE OPENED A GLAD SHRIEK WAS HEARD AND KATY'S HEAD APPEARED
HE TOLD ME CASUALLY THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS THREE PARTS DRUNK IN HIS OWN CABIN AS I ASSUMED THE CLOTHES
THEY WERE WHAT SHE CALLED NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THE NEIGHBORS PITIED HER VERY MUCH
WHEN KATE AND AUNT IZZIE WERE WILLING THEY HAD ONLY TO CLIMB A PAIR OF BARS VERY EASY ONES AND WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF AN ANGEL WITH FLAMING SWORD TO STOP THE WAY
AT THIS TIME SHE LOOKED AT THEM WITH PLEASED EYES THEY WERE ALL SO SPICK AND SPAN WITH SUCH NICELY BRUSHED JACKETS AND SUCH NEATLY COMBED HAIR BUT THE MOMENT THE BELL RANG HER COMFORT WAS OVER FROM THAT TIME ON
THEY SAY ASTONISHED DID YOU TOO PLAY
HE HAD WRITTEN THAT DECLARATION WHICH FOR INSOLENCE MALIGNITY AND MENDACITY
THEIR EYES SEEMED TO BE WEAK FOR THEY BOTH WORE BLACK GOGGLES THEY HAD SIX LEGS APIECE TWO SHORT ONES TWO NOT SO SHORT AND TWO VERY LONG
THE MATTER SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT ENDED IN BLOWS BUT IN THAT I THOUGHT MY EARS WERE MISTAKEN THEN HE SHOUTED AT THE DOGS AND RETURNED TO THE CABIN WELL SAID HE IN THE DOORWAY YOU WERE JUST BEGINNING TO TELL ME
WHICH I TOLD IN CONCISE SENTENCES ENOUGH FOR I FELT HORRIBLY WEAK AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE REVERTED AT ONCE TO THE TOPIC OF NATURAL HISTORY AND HIS OWN BIOLOGICAL STUDIES HE BEGAN TO QUESTION ME CLOSELY ABOUT TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND GOWER STREET
HE'S CAPTAIN TOO NAMED DAVIES
CAME IN AGAIN AS I STOOD THERE AND I ASKED HIM FOR SOME CLOTHES HE LENT ME SOME DUCK THINGS OF HIS OWN FOR THOSE I HAD WORN IN THE BOAT HAD BEEN THROWN OVERBOARD THEY WERE RATHER LOOSE FOR ME FOR HE WAS LARGE AND LONG IN HIS LIMBS
I DON'T BELIEVE THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO PRINT THINGS ABOUT YOU KATY CARR PUT IN ELSIE VINDICTIVELY YES THEY WILL SAID CLOVER AND GAVE ELSIE A PUSH
NOTICE YOUR ARM'S SORE INJECTIONS YOU'VE BEEN INSENSIBLE FOR NEARLY THIRTY HOURS I THOUGHT SLOWLY
AND THE VOICE OF A HUMAN BEING TOGETHER THEN ANOTHER VOICE TELLING SOME HEAVEN FORSAKEN IDIOT TO DESIST YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD SAID MY INTERLOCUTOR
POOR KATY ALWAYS SAID WHEN I'M GROWN UP FORGETTING HOW VERY MUCH SHE HAD GROWN ALREADY PERHAPS SHE WENT ON IT WILL BE ROWING OUT IN BOATS AND SAVING PEOPLES LIVES LIKE THAT GIRL IN THE BOOK
THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH
CLOVER IS GOING TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD BUT I'LL BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WHEN ONCE THE SLAUGHTER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS OVER CAN SCARCELY BE TREATED TOO LENIENTLY THIS RULE SO EVIDENTLY AGREEABLE TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY WAS NOT ONLY NOT OBSERVED IT WAS INVERTED
I DARESAY IT'S ALL DIFFERENT NOW BUT I MUST LOOK UP THAT ASS OF A COOK AND SEE WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOUR MUTTON THE GROWLING OVERHEAD WAS RENEWED SO SUDDENLY AND WITH SO MUCH SAVAGE ANGER THAT IT STARTLED ME WHAT'S THAT
AS I WALKED HOME I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KATY A KATY I ONCE KNEW
LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
THERE WERE ALWAYS SO MANY DELIGHTFUL SCHEMES RIOTING IN HER BRAINS
GETTING UP IN A GREAT PET BUT CLOVER WHO WAS A BORN PEACEMAKER CAUGHT HOLD OF HIS ARM
THIS LITTLE STORY GREW IN MY HEAD AND I RESOLVED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU I HAVE DONE IT AND IN MEMORY OF MY TWO LITTLE FRIENDS ON THE BULRUSH I GIVE IT THEIR NAME HERE IT IS THE STORY OF WHAT KATY DID
I'M A PASSENGER MYSELF FROM ARICA
I TOLD HIM MY NAME EDWARD PRENDICK AND HOW I HAD TAKEN TO NATURAL HISTORY AS A RELIEF FROM THE DULNESS OF MY COMFORTABLE INDEPENDENCE HE SEEMED INTERESTED IN THIS I'VE DONE SOME SCIENCE MYSELF
I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY RAN AWAY FROM HER WHICH AS THEIR LEGS WERE LONGEST IT WAS EASY TO DO
OR PERHAPS I SHALL GO AND NURSE IN THE HOSPITAL LIKE MISS NIGHTINGALE OR ELSE I'LL HEAD A CRUSADE AND RIDE ON A WHITE HORSE WITH ARMOR AND A HELMET ON MY HEAD AND CARRY A SACRED FLAG OR IF I DON'T DO THAT I'LL PAINT PICTURES
WHEREAS KATY TORE HER DRESS EVERY DAY HATED SEWING AND DIDN'T CARE A BUTTON ABOUT BEING CALLED GOOD WHILE CLOVER AND ELSIE SHIED OFF LIKE RESTLESS PONIES WHEN ANY ONE TRIED TO PAT THEIR HEADS IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO AUNT IZZIE
IT SHALL BE SOMETHING AND WHEN AUNT IZZIE SEES IT AND READS ABOUT ME IN THE NEWSPAPERS SHE WILL SAY THE DEAR CHILD
THEN SANTA CLAUS WAKED UP THE FAIRY AND TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF ROSY POSY HE SHOULD PUT SOME OTHER FAIRY INTO HER PLACE AND SET HER TO KEEP GUARD OVER A PRICKLY SCRATCHY BLACKBERRY BUSH
AND A BLISSFUL STICKINESS PERVADED THE PARTY
WHERE SAID I IT'S AN ISLAND WHERE I LIVE SO FAR AS I KNOW IT HASN'T GOT A NAME HE STARED AT ME WITH HIS NETHER LIP DROPPING AND LOOKED SO WILFULLY STUPID OF A SUDDEN
OR SING OR SCALP SCULP WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW MAKE FIGURES IN MARBLE
AND FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALL LEGS AND ELBOWS AND ANGLES AND JOINTS HAPPILY HER HEAD WAS SO FULL OF OTHER THINGS OF PLANS AND SCHEMES AND FANCIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE DIDN'T OFTEN TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER HOW TALL SHE WAS
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN TO DO ISN'T IT THE SAME THING ASKED CECY OH NO REPLIED KATY QUITE DIFFERENT FOR YOU SEE I MEAN TO DO SOMETHING GRAND
HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE QUESTION IN MY FACE FOR MY VOICE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO ME YOU WERE PICKED UP IN A BOAT STARVING THE NAME ON THE BOAT WAS THE LADY VAIN
IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER
WHICH SHE WAVED TRIUMPHANTLY HURRAY SHE CRIED ALL DONE AND AUNT IZZIE SAYS WE MAY GO ARE YOU TIRED OUT WAITING
SO IN THEY MARCHED KATY AND CECY HEADING THE PROCESSION
OR PERHAPS ON THE VERY TOP STEP OF THE SCUTTLE LADDER SHE SPIED THE LITTLE PAPER BOX WITH ITS LOAD OF NOTES ALL ENDING WITH BE SURE AND NOT LET ELSIE KNOW THEN SHE WOULD SEIZE THE BOX AND MARCHING UP TO WHEREVER THE OTHERS WERE
ONLY A GREAT DEAL PRETTIER ALL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WILL WANT ME TO GO AND RIDE BUT I SHAN'T NOTICE THEM AT ALL BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHALL ALWAYS BE TEACHING IN SUNDAY SCHOOL AND VISITING THE POOR AND SOME DAY
LEST SOME HUNGRY COW SHOULD TAKE A FANCY TO THE ROSE BUSH AND EAT IT UP YES SAID KATY STROKING A LEAF WITH HER FINGER IT WAS IN GREAT DANGER ONE NIGHT LAST WINTER BUT IT ESCAPED
AND BATTER PUDDINGS NOT BOILED ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE BAKED ONES WITH BROWN SHINY TOPS AND A GREAT DEAL OF PUDDING SAUCE TO EAT ON THEM
IN PLACE OF THIS MAMMA WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED SO DIMLY THERE WAS AUNT IZZIE PAPA'S SISTER WHO CAME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN MAMMA WENT AWAY ON THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM WHICH FOR SO MANY MONTHS
BY AND BY JOHN AND DORRY TROTTED AWAY ON MYSTERIOUS ERRANDS OF THEIR OWN WASN'T DORRY FUNNY WITH HIS TURKEY REMARKED CECY AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN IF YOU WON'T TELL SAID KATY I'LL LET YOU SEE DORRY'S JOURNAL
BRINGING UP THE REAR OH THERE IS THE DEAR ROSARY ALL SAFE CRIED THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY AND CAME UPON A TALL STUMP
ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE WOOD PILES AND BARNS AND AN ICE HOUSE BEHIND WAS A KITCHEN GARDEN SLOPING TO THE SOUTH AND BEHIND THAT A PASTURE WITH A BROOK IN IT
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE LONG WINTER WHO KNEW WHAT THE FAIRIES MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE SINCE ANY OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE WHICH PATH SHALL WE GO IN BY ASKED CLOVER AT LAST SUPPOSE WE VOTE SAID KATY
AND NEVER RUN AWAY AND HIDE AND THERE WON'T BE ANY POST OFFICES OR ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE WHAT'LL YOU BE JOHNNIE ASKED CLOVER ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FOR ELSIE'S VOICE WAS GROWING PLAINTIVE
THEN CAME ELSIE A THIN BROWN CHILD OF EIGHT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND CRISP SHORT CURLS COVERING THE WHOLE OF HER SMALL HEAD POOR LITTLE ELSIE WAS THE ODD ONE AMONG THE CARRS
THE CHILDREN HADN'T ANY MAMMA SHE HAD DIED WHEN PHIL WAS A BABY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY STORY BEGAN KATY COULD REMEMBER HER PRETTY WELL TO THE REST SHE WAS BUT A SAD SWEET NAME
OR TO SING FOR I COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHICH IT WAS ONE VOICE WAS SHRILL THE OTHER WHICH WAS A LITTLE DEEPER SOUNDED VERY POSITIVE AND CROSS THEY WERE EVIDENTLY DISPUTING ABOUT SOMETHING
LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO
SHE WAS A NEAT DAPPER PINK AND WHITE GIRL MODEST AND PRIM IN MANNER WITH LIGHT SHINY HAIR WHICH ALWAYS KEPT SMOOTH AND SLIM HANDS WHICH NEVER LOOKED DIRTY
I SAY BY THE PILGRIM'S PATH AND THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY SO DO I CHIMED IN CLOVER WHO ALWAYS AGREED WITH KATY THE PATH OF PEACE IS NICE SUGGESTED CECY NO NO
THESE SAME ACTIVE BRAINS GOT HER INTO PERPETUAL SCRAPES SHE WAS FOND OF BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR
WERE SEVEN LITTLE PIES MOLASSES PIES BAKED IN SAUCERS EACH WITH A BROWN TOP AND CRISP CANDIFIED EDGE
THE DELICATE WOMEN TO WHOM HE WAS INEXORABLY SEVERE
SO DARLINGS TAKE THIS LITTLE CHILDISH STORY
TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
EVEN BABY VOTES AND STAR EYED CHILDREN IN WHOSE INNOCENT FACES KINDLES THE GLADNESS WHICH WAS ONCE OUR OWN CROWD ROUND OUR KNEES WITH SWEET AND COAXING VOICES ASKING FOR STORIES OF THAT OLD TIME HOME
WHEN IT WAS DONE THEY ALL CUDDLED IN UNDERNEATH IT WAS A VERY SMALL BOWER JUST BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM AND THE BASKETS AND THE KITTEN I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ROOM FOR ANYBODY ELSE NOT EVEN ANOTHER KITTEN KATY
JAMES HAD WATCHED THE CIRCUIT WITH INTEREST AND DELIGHT IN HIS DRAWINGROOM AND AT HIS TABLE
AS IF TO SEE ITS OWN BEAUTIFUL FACE IN THE WATER BUT THE CARDINAL DID NOT SEEM TO BE VAIN THE PICTURE WAS SO PRETTY THAT I SAT A LONG TIME ENJOYING IT SUDDENLY CLOSE TO ME TWO SMALL VOICES BEGAN TO TALK
AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
HE HAD INSTIGATED MONMOUTH FIRST TO INVADE THE KINGDOM AND THEN TO USURP THE CROWN IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A STRICT SEARCH WOULD BE MADE FOR THE ARCHTRAITOR AS HE WAS OFTEN CALLED
AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A SIGHT OF WASHING THOSE CHILDREN MADE
I MEAN TO HAVE JUST THE SAME CRIED ELSIE WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS FIRED BY THIS GORGEOUS VISION ONLY MY POND WILL BE THE BIGGEST I SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL BEAUTIFULLER TOO SHE ADDED YOU CAN'T SAID KATY FROM OVERHEAD
SHE WAS AS HEEDLESS AND INNOCENT AS A CHILD OF SIX
WAVED A WILD ROSE BUSH BUDDED OVER WITH FRESH GREEN EAVES THIS ROSARY WAS A FASCINATING THING TO THEIR MINDS THEY WERE ALWAYS INVENTING STORIES ABOUT IT AND WERE IN CONSTANT TERROR
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF MAN CALLS THE THING THE
HE KEPT IT ONCE FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS AND THEN GAVE IT UP I FOUND THE BOOK THIS MORNING IN THE NURSERY CLOSET ALL OF THEM PROMISED AND KATY PRODUCED IT FROM HER POCKET IT BEGAN THUS
WHICH THE CHILDREN CALLED POLLYPODS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE REAL NAME THEY STAID A LONG WHILE PICKING BUNCHES OF THESE FLOWERS AND THEN JOHN AND DORRY HAD TO GRUB UP AN ARMFUL OF SASSAFRAS ROOTS SO THAT BEFORE THEY HAD FAIRLY GONE THROUGH TOADSTOOL AVENUE
HERE ENDED THE EXTRACTS AND IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY A MINUTE HAD PASSED SINCE THEY STOPPED LAUGHING OVER THEM BEFORE THE LONG SHADOWS BEGAN TO FALL AND MARY CAME TO SAY THAT ALL OF THEM MUST COME IN TO GET READY FOR TEA
AUNT IZZIE HAD PUT UP LUNCHES FOR PARADISE BEFORE YOU SEE AND KNEW PRETTY WELL WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE WAY OF APPETITE OH HOW GOOD EVERYTHING TASTED IN THAT BOWER WITH THE FRESH WIND RUSTLING THE POPLAR LEAVES SUNSHINE AND SWEET WOOD SMELLS ABOUT THEM
ALL I'M GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL LADY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD AND I'M GOING TO LIVE IN A YELLOW CASTLE WITH YELLOW PILLARS TO THE PORTICO AND A SQUARE THING ON TOP LIKE MISTER SAWYER'S MY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAY HOUSE UP THERE
AND RAGED FIERCELY AGAINST HIS INNOCENT PROGENY
WHICH WERE HER GREATEST GRIEVANCE HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND QUICK AS A BIRD'S SHE WOULD PEEP AND PEER AND FOLLOW AND WATCH TILL AT LAST IN SOME ODD UNLIKELY PLACE THE CROTCH OF A TREE
I SHALL WEAR GOLD DRESSES AND SILVER DRESSES EVERY DAY AND DIAMOND RINGS AND HAVE WHITE SATIN APRONS TO TIE ON WHEN I'M DUSTING OR DOING ANYTHING DIRTY IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACK YARD
RABBIT HOLLOW AND THE REST THE SUN WAS JUST OVER THEIR HEADS AND IT WAS NOON I'M GETTING HUNGRY SAID DORRY OH NO DORRY YOU MUSTN'T BE HUNGRY TILL THE BOWER IS READY CRIED THE LITTLE GIRLS ALARMED FOR DORRY WAS APT TO BE DISCONSOLATE
AND THERE WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE GUNWALE AT THE SAME TIME MY EYE CAUGHT MY HAND SO THIN THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY SKIN PURSE FULL OF LOOSE BONES AND ALL THE BUSINESS OF THE BOAT CAME BACK TO ME
ME WANT DOLLY AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO INQUIRE HE CALLED OUT SHARPLY FOR SHAME KATY GIVE YOUR SISTER HER DOLL AT ONCE WHICH KATY MUCH SURPRISED DID WHILE CLOVER PURRED IN TRIUMPH
SHE WAS A FAIR SWEET DUMPLING OF A GIRL WITH THICK PIG TAILS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AND SHORT SIGHTED BLUE EYES WHICH SEEMED TO HOLD TEARS JUST READY TO FALL FROM UNDER THE BLUE REALLY CLOVER WAS THE JOLLIEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
HURRY UP CLOVER AND GET THE THINGS CECY AND I WILL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE THE CHILDREN JUMPED UP GLADLY AND SLID DOWN THE ROOF CLOVER FETCHED A COUPLE OF BASKETS FROM THE WOOD SHED ELSIE RAN FOR HER KITTEN
AND AS WITH CARELESS HANDS YOU TURN THE PAGES
THE RANK WHICH HE HAD INHERITED IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHICH HE HAD BORNE IN THE REBEL ARMY
AND ENCOURAGED CLIMBING AND ROUGH PLAYS IN SPITE OF THE BUMPS AND RAGGED CLOTHES WHICH RESULTED IN FACT THERE WAS JUST ONE HALF HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN AUNT IZZIE WAS REALLY SATISFIED ABOUT HER CHARGES AND THAT WAS THE HALF HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST
NARROW WINDING PATHS RAN HERE AND THERE MADE BY THE CATTLE AS THEY WANDERED TO AND FRO THIS PLACE THE CHILDREN CALLED PARADISE AND TO THEM
IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE CONTINUED KATY IN A MYSTERIOUS TONE THE FAIRY OF THE ROSARY WAS QUITE SICK SHE HAD TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IN HER HEAD AND THE POPLAR TREE FAIRY JUST OVER THERE
WHAT SHE DID TO MAKE HERSELF GROW SO NOBODY COULD TELL BUT THERE SHE WAS UP ABOVE PAPA'S EAR AND HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN POOR AUNT IZZIE WHENEVER SHE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT HER HEIGHT SHE BECAME VERY AWKWARD
SPOKEN ON SUNDAY AND AT PRAYER TIMES
I MEAN TO HAVE A BLACK SILK DRESS AND PINK ROSES IN MY BONNET AND A WHITE MUSLIN LONG SHAWL SAID CECY AND I MEAN TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MINERVA CLARK I SHALL BE VERY GOOD TOO
LEFT IT ALL HE SAID TEN YEARS AGO HOW JOLLY IT ALL USED TO BE BUT I MADE A YOUNG ASS OF MYSELF
WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
TO DAUNT OUR BRIGHT UNFEARING LIVES CAN YOU WE QUARRELLED OFTEN BUT MADE PEACE AS QUICKLY SHED MANY TEARS BUT LAUGHED THE WHILE THEY FELL HAD OUR SMALL WOES OUR CHILDISH BUMPS AND BRUISES
SHE WAS A DEAR LOVING CHILD FOR ALL HER CARELESS HABITS AND MADE BUSHELS OF GOOD RESOLUTIONS EVERY WEEK OF HER LIFE ONLY UNLUCKILY SHE NEVER KEPT ANY OF THEM SHE HAD FITS OF RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE OTHER CHILDREN
AND THE LOW ANGRY GROWLING OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL AT THE SAME TIME THE MAN SPOKE HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
THEY BEGAN WALKING UP THE RUSH AND THEN I SAW THAT THEY MOVED EXACTLY LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED GIG IN FACT IF I HADN'T BEEN TOO BIG I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CREAK AS THEY WENT ALONG
KATY'S NAME WAS KATY CARR SHE LIVED IN THE TOWN OF BURNET WHICH WASN'T A VERY BIG TOWN
CLOVER HELD FAST AND WOULD NOT LET GO DOCTOR CARR WHO WASN'T ATTENDING PARTICULARLY HEARD NOTHING BUT THE PATHETIC TONE OF CLOVER'S VOICE AS SHE SAID
FOR THEY SAID THE SAME WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THESE WERE THE WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T DID DIDN'T
WAS THAT HE WAS SAFE ON THE CONTINENT IT WAS STRONGLY SUSPECTED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST WHICH HE WAS CONSTANTLY PLOTTING THAT HE HAD
HAVE SOME OF THIS SAID HE AND GAVE ME A DOSE OF SOME SCARLET STUFF ICED IT TASTED LIKE BLOOD AND MADE ME FEEL STRONGER YOU WERE IN LUCK SAID HE
PA SAID SO THE PATH OF PEACE GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE OF ITS DARKNESS AND COOLNESS HIGH BUSHES ALMOST MET OVER IT AND TREES KEPT IT SHADY EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY A SORT OF WHITE FLOWER GREW THERE
THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE ONLY SEPARATED BY A GREEN HEDGE WITH NO GATE SO THAT CECY SPENT TWO THIRDS OF HER TIME AT DOCTOR CARR'S
JUST AS THEY WERE READY THE SIDE DOOR BANGED AND KATY AND CECY HALL CAME INTO THE YARD I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT CECY SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE CHILDREN'S AND LIVED IN A HOUSE NEXT DOOR
A LITTLE FAT MAN WITH A WAND IN HIS HAND POPPED OUT FROM BEHIND THE STUMP IT WAS SANTA CLAUS OF COURSE HE GAVE THE BULL SUCH A RAP WITH HIS WAND THAT HE MOO ED DREADFULLY AND THEN PUT UP HIS FORE PAW TO SEE IF HIS NOSE WAS ON OR NOT
AND OF USE NEVER SAW AS SHE DRIFTED ON HER HEEDLESS WAY THAT HERE IN THIS LONELY LITTLE SISTER WAS THE VERY CHANCE SHE WANTED FOR BEING A COMFORT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED COMFORT VERY MUCH SHE NEVER SAW IT
AND WE'D NEVER SEW OR KNIT GARTERS OR DO ANYTHING WE DIDN'T WANT TO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE
AND ELSIE'S HEAVY HEART WENT UNCHEERED DORRY AND JOANNA SAT ON THE TWO ENDS OF THE RIDGE POLE DORRY WAS SIX YEARS OLD A PALE PUDGY BOY WITH RATHER A SOLEMN FACE
THAT HE FINALLY SAID HE WOULD STAY ESPECIALLY AS THE OTHERS WERE QUITE GRAVE NOW AND PROMISED THAT THEY WOULDN'T LAUGH ANY MORE
WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER THE GREAT DISCOVERY OF COLUMBUS
MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BAD SECRETARY WHERE YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED FOR SHAME THAT'S UNWORTHY A MAN OF SPIRIT IS NOT TO BE REMINDED OF SUCH SERVICES
HUMILIATED BY THE SUSPICION AND MOREOVER TERRIFIED AT THE CALM AIR OF THE MUSKETEER AND I SAID PORTHOS ROLLING HIS LARGE EYES REMEMBER I WILL SKIN YOU ALIVE AH MONSIEUR
I HAVE DREAMED THAT THE UNLUCKY ENGLISHMAN WAS DEAD I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHETHER IT WAS BY STEEL OR BY POISON ONLY OF THIS I AM SURE I HAVE DREAMED HE WAS DEAD AND YOU KNOW MY DREAMS NEVER DECEIVE ME BE ASSURED THEN OF SEEING ME SOON RETURN
THIS JEAN CARTIER OR QUARTIER WHO WAS BORN IN SAINT MALO IN FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TOOK TO WIFE IN FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GUILLEMETTE BAUDOIN OF THE FOUR SONS THAT SHE BORE HIM
OUT OF THIS BACKGROUND THEN OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONJECTURE EMERGES IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR JACQUES CARTIER A
HAS PICTURED UPON IT A GROUP OF FIGURES THAT REPRESENT THE LANDING OF THE NAVIGATOR AND HIS FOLLOWERS AMONG THE INDIANS OF GASPE IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE TIME TO ATTEMPT BY SUCH DECORATIONS TO MAKE MAPS VIVID
YOU WILL FURTHER SAY TO HIM WATCH OVER HIS GRACE LORD BUCKINGHAM FOR THEY WISH TO ASSASSINATE HIM BUT THIS PLANCHET IS SO SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE NOT INFORMED MY FRIENDS THAT I WOULD ENTRUST THIS SECRET TO YOU AND FOR A CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION I WOULD NOT WRITE IT
A PARTNER WORTHY OF HIS COMPANY THEY WERE PLAYING TOGETHER AS USUAL WHEN SEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED THE PATROL WAS HEARD PASSING TO DOUBLE THE POSTS AT HALF PAST SEVEN THE RETREAT WAS SOUNDED WE ARE LOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN THE EAR OF ATHOS
DEEPLY TO BE DEPLORED THAT BEYOND THE RECORD OF HIS VOYAGES WE KNOW SO LITTLE OF JACQUES CARTIER HIMSELF WE MAY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE EARLY BECAME A SAILOR BROUGHT UP AT SUCH A TIME AND PLACE HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO DO SO
A BISHOP OF CASTLE GWENT WITH A SMALL BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE LEADER OF THIS FLOCK WAS KNOWN AS SAINT MALO AND HE GAVE HIS NAME TO THE SEAPORT
PLANCHET IS BRAVE AND SHREWD THEY ARE TWO QUALITIES OUT OF THE FOUR GENTLEMEN SAID ARAMIS THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION IS NOT TO KNOW WHICH OF OUR FOUR LACKEYS IS THE MOST DISCREET THE MOST STRONG THE MOST CLEVER OR THE MOST BRAVE
QUIETLY DRAWING FOUR PISTOLES FROM HIS POCKET AND THROWING THEM UPON THE TABLE COME GENTLEMEN SAID HE THEY ARE BEATING THE TATTOO LET US TO BED AND ATHOS WENT OUT OF THE PARPAILLOT FOLLOWED BY D'ARTAGNAN ARAMIS CAME BEHIND GIVING HIS ARM TO PORTHOS
MY DEAR ARAMIS YOU HAVE THE PEN OF A SECRETARY OF STATE LORD DE WINTER WILL NOW BE UPON HIS GUARD IF THE LETTER SHOULD REACH HIM AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINAL WE SHALL NOT BE COMPROMISED
BUT THE THIRD TIME WHICH IS THE PRESENT YOU MAY SUCCUMB YOUR RELATIVE LEFT LA ROCHELLE FOR ENGLAND DURING THE NIGHT WATCH HER ARRIVAL FOR SHE HAS GREAT AND TERRIBLE PROJECTS IF YOU REQUIRE TO KNOW POSITIVELY WHAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF
AND D'ARTAGNAN IN PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE WAGERED THAT THE DAYS WERE FORTY FOUR HOURS HE FORGOT THE NECESSARY SLOWNESS OF NAVIGATION HE EXAGGERATED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF MILADY
THEN MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET YOU MUST BUY ME A WATCH
UNFORTUNATELY SAID ATHOS HE WHOM WE SEND MUST POSSESS IN HIMSELF ALONE THE FOUR QUALITIES UNITED
IF SHE IS AS GREAT A LADY AS HER WRITING IS LARGE YOU ARE A LUCKY FELLOW GOMRADE
AND PLACES CONFIDENCE IN NOBODY BUT HIM ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD FAIL BESIDES BAZIN IS AMBITIOUS AND LEARNED BAZIN HAS READ HISTORY GENTLEMEN HE KNOWS THAT SIXTUS THE FIFTH BECAME POPE AFTER HAVING KEPT PIGS
IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
ITS OWNER DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND IN DOING SO HE STUMBLED UPON A STARTLING DISCOVERY HE FOUND A DUMMY WINDOW THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILT OVER AND CONCEALED
AND IN THOSE DAYS THIS WOULD SCARCELY HAVE OCCURRED TO A WRITER WHO HAD NOT SEEN BOTH PLANTS OF WHICH HE SPOKE THERE GROWETH LIKEWISE SO RUNS THE QUAINT TRANSLATION THAT APPEARS IN HAKLUYT'S VOYAGES
MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
AND OF THEIR FIVE CHILDREN THE SECOND ONE JACQUES ROSE TO GREATNESS AS THE DISCOVERER OF CANADA THERE IS LITTLE TO CHRONICLE
ARAMIS MUMBLED VERSES TO HIMSELF AND PORTHOS FROM TIME TO TIME PULLED A HAIR OR TWO FROM HIS MUSTACHE IN SIGN OF DESPAIR BUT ALL AT ONCE A SHADOW APPEARED IN THE DARKNESS THE OUTLINE OF WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO D'ARTAGNAN AND A WELL KNOWN VOICE SAID
SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES CRIED PORTHOS THAT POOR LITTLE DIAMOND WAS WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES
DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO SLEEP VERY QUIETLY
BUT LET ME BE PROPERLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT
WHOSE NAME IS ASSOCIATED FOR ALL TIME WITH THE PROUD TITLE OF DISCOVERER OF CANADA THE PICTURE IS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE STANDING ON THE DECK OF A SHIP HIS BENT ELBOW RESTING UPON THE GUNWALE
IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PICTURE WHICH HANGS IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO IF IT DOES NOT SHOW US CARTIER AS HE WAS AND WE HAVE NO ABSOLUTE PROOF IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION
WE WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS FROM TERROR CREATED BY THE THREATS OR FROM TENDERNESS AT SEEING FOUR FRIENDS SO CLOSELY UNITED D'ARTAGNAN TOOK HIS HAND
LET US GIVE HIM ONLY HALF THE SUM PROMISED HIM WITH THE LETTER WITH AN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL HAVE THE OTHER HALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REPLY
DEMONS DEITIES MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES AND NAKED SAVAGES DISPORTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE MAPS AND HELPED TO DECORATE UNEXPLORED SPACES OF EARTH AND OCEAN
PORTHOS AND ARAMIS REMAINED BEHIND TO ENCOUNTER THE JOKES OF THE DRAGOON AND THE SWISS AS TO BAZIN HE WENT AND LAY DOWN ON A TRUSS OF STRAW AND AS HE HAD MORE IMAGINATION THAN THE SWISS HE DREAMED THAT ARAMIS HAVING BECOME POPE
THE SON OF HIS SISTER JEHANNE STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST OF A GREAT MANY SACRED CEREMONIES OF THIS SORT IN WHICH HE TOOK PART THERE IS A RECORD OF MORE THAN FIFTY BAPTISMS AT SAINT MALO
DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF PIERRE CARTIER THE UNCLE OF JACQUES WERE STILL SURVIVING IN FRANCE IT IS PERHAPS NO GREAT LOSS TO THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES OF THE FAMOUS MARINER IT IS HOWEVER
AND I SAID ARAMIS WITH HIS SOFT MELODIUS VOICE REMEMBER THAT I WILL ROAST YOU AT A SLOW FIRE LIKE A SAVAGE AH MONSIEUR PLANCHET BEGAN TO WEEP
HIS CHIN SUPPORTED BY HIS HAND WHILE HIS EYES GAZE OUTWARD UPON THE WESTERN OCEAN AS IF SEEKING TO PENETRATE ITS MYSTERIES THE FACE IS FIRM AND STRONG WITH TIGHT SET JAW PROMINENT BROW
ADORNED HIS HEAD WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT BUT AS WE HAVE SAID BAZIN HAD NOT BY HIS FORTUNATE RETURN REMOVED MORE THAN A PART OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS THE DAYS OF EXPECTATION ARE LONG
AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
A BENEFIT REPROACHED IS AN OFFENSE COMMITTED THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE IF THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN UNDER YOUR CENSURE MY FAITH I RENOUNCE THE TASK AND YOU WILL DO RIGHT HANDLE THE MUSKET AND THE SWORD MY DEAR FELLOW
AND IT IS A RATHER DIFFICULT MATTER THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF WOULD BE PUZZLED HOW TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER AND YET THE CHANCELLOR DRAWS UP AN OFFICIAL REPORT VERY READILY NEVER MIND BE SILENT I WILL WRITE
D'ARTAGNAN HAS GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN AT ONCE THE DEVIL
ARAMIS ACCORDINGLY TOOK THE QUILL REFLECTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WROTE EIGHT OR TEN LINES IN A CHARMING LITTLE FEMALE HAND AND THEN WITH A VOICE SOFT AND SLOW AS IF EACH WORD HAD BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY WEIGHED HE READ THE FOLLOWING MY LORD
WELL MY DEAR FRIEND ADD TO HIS NATURAL DEVOTEDNESS A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND THEN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING FOR HIM ONCE ANSWER FOR HIM TWICE
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MONSIEUR ABBE HERE FOR EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS OR COMMON WANTS WILL THAT DO
THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
AND THE PROTEGE OF THE HIGH ADMIRAL OF FRANCE WE DO NOT KNOW THIS POSITION IN ITSELF AND THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE IN FIFTEEN NINETEEN HE HAD ALREADY THE RANK OF MASTER PILOT
THE FOUR FRIENDS DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE TWO ABSENCES HAD AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED THE EYE ON THE WATCH THE NOSE TO THE WIND AND THE EAR ON THE HARK
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN A WOMAN OF MARK SAID PORTHOS WITH HIS LOUD LAUGH
NEFFER
WITH PRECISELY THE FACE AND BEARING WHICH THE HERO WORSHIPPER WOULD READ INTO THE CHARACTER OF SUCH A DISCOVERER THE PORT OF SAINT MALO THE BIRTHPLACE AND THE HOME OF CARTIER IS SITUATED IN THE OLD PROVINCE OF BRITTANY
THESE GENTLEMEN ONLY SAY THIS OUT OF AFFECTION FOR ME BUT AT BOTTOM THEY ALL LIKE YOU AH MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I WILL SUCCEED OR I WILL CONSENT TO BE CUT IN QUARTERS AND IF THEY DO CUT ME IN QUARTERS BE ASSURED THAT NOT A MORSEL OF ME WILL SPEAK
READ HER PAST HISTORY ON HER LEFT SHOULDER
IN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WHICH THE ILLUSTRIOUS MARINER HAD SOME SHARE IN TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM HE APPEARED AS A GODFATHER WHAT VOYAGES CARTIER ACTUALLY MADE BEFORE HE SUDDENLY APPEARS IN HISTORY AS A PILOT OF THE KING OF FRANCE
THE PERSON WHO WRITES THESE FEW LINES HAD THE HONOR OF CROSSING SWORDS WITH YOU IN THE LITTLE ENCLOSURE
D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
THE PRINCIPAL THING IS TO KNOW WHICH LOVES MONEY THE BEST WHAT ARAMIS SAYS IS VERY SENSIBLE REPLIED ATHOS WE MUST SPECULATE UPON THE FAULTS OF PEOPLE AND NOT UPON THEIR VIRTUES MONSIEUR ABBE YOU ARE A GREAT MORALIST
AND ME TOO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND ME TOO SAID PORTHOS AND ME TOO SAID ARAMIS
HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO MY WAYS AND I AM PARTICULAR YESTERDAY'S AFFAIR MUST HAVE SHAKEN HIM A LITTLE HIS VOYAGE WOULD UPSET HIM QUITE PLANCHET WAS SENT FOR AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN HIM THE MATTER HAD BEEN NAMED TO HIM BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE POINTED OUT THE MONEY TO HIM
IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO THERE HANGS A PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN OF THAT PLACE
LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH GROWETH IN BRESIL AND LATER ON IN THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SECOND VOYAGE HE REPEATS THE REFERENCE TO BRAZIL THEN GOODLY AND LARGE FIELDS
STILL FURTHER HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE WORTHY PICARD AT ONE TIME SO GREAT DIMINISHED DAY BY DAY
NOW SWORN TO THE SERVICE OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY
HERE AGAIN ARE THE TUFTED HAT THE BEARDED FACE AND THE FEATURES OF THE PICTURE OF SAINT MALO ON THE BACK OF THE WOOD THE DEEPLY GRAVEN INITIALS J C SEEMED TO PROVE
MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
ON HIS HEAD IS THE TUFTED BRETON CAP FAMILIAR IN THE PICTURES OF THE DAYS OF THE GREAT NAVIGATORS AT THE WAIST ON THE LEFT SIDE HANGS A SWORD AND ON THE RIGHT CLOSE TO THE BELT THE DIRK OR PONIARD OF THE PERIOD
AND DID NOT LET GO TILL IT WAS REDUCED TO A CINDER THEN CALLING PLANCHET HE SAID NOW MY LAD YOU MAY CLAIM YOUR SEVEN HUNDRED LIVRES
BUT SHE COULD NOT MARRY YOUR BROTHER BEING ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE AND HAVING BEEN
HIS EMINENCE IS THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICIAN OF TIMES PAST OF TIMES PRESENT AND PROBABLY OF TIMES TO COME HE WOULD EXTINGUISH THE SUN IF THE SUN INCOMMODED HIM GIVE THESE HAPPY TIDINGS TO YOUR SISTER MY DEAR COUSIN
FOR WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PORTRAIT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF RECENT YEARS SEEMS TO CONFIRM IN SOME DEGREE THE GENUINENESS OF THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT
IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WHO FELT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART A PARTIALITY FOR THE DUKE TOOK PLANCHET ASIDE
NOT AT ALL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS THE MATTER SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT VERY EASY IT WOULD BE NO DOUBT PARBLEU IF WE WRITE TO LORD DE WINTER ABOUT AFFAIRS OF VAST IMPORTANCE OF THE HORRORS OF THE CARDINAL
IF YOUR ARRANGEMENTS AT TOURS ARE YOUR ARRANGEMENTS ARAMIS THOSE OF LONDON ARE MINE I REQUEST THEN THAT PLANCHET MAY BE CHOSEN MORE PARTICULARLY AS HE HAS ALREADY BEEN TO LONDON WITH ME AND KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
MASTER PILOT OF THE PORT OF SAINCTE MALO
A KIND OF MILLET AS BIG AS PEASON
TO LET A WOMAN TERRIFY YOU SO AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO AFTER ALL TO BE IMPRISONED WELL BUT WE SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF PRISON MADAME BONACIEUX WAS RELEASED
THE HEAD IS SLIGHTLY BOWED WITH THE WEIGHT OF YEARS AND THE FACE IS WANTING IN THAT SUGGESTION OF UNCONQUERABLE WILL WHICH IS THE DOMINATING FEATURE OF THE PORTRAIT OF SAINT MALO
HOW LIKE OR UNLIKE THE FEATURES OF CARTIER THIS PICTURE IN THE TOWN HALL MAY BE WE HAVE NO MEANS OF TELLING PAINTED PROBABLY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE IT HAS HUNG THERE FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS
AND OPENED THE SO ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED LETTER IT CONTAINED HALF A LINE IN A HAND PERFECTLY BRITISH AND WITH A CONCISENESS AS PERFECTLY SPARTAN THANK YOU BE EASY D'ARTAGNAN TRANSLATED THIS FOR THE OTHERS
AND IN LOOKING OUT FOR ALL THE COURIERS WHO ARRIVED MORE THAN ONCE AN INVOLUNTARY TREMBLING SEIZED THEM WHEN CALLED UPON FOR SOME UNEXPECTED SERVICE THEY HAD BESIDES TO LOOK CONSTANTLY TO THEIR OWN PROPER SAFETY
WELL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT TO D'ARTAGNAN WHO BY IT UNDERSTOOD HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK WELL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID D'ARTAGNAN MY LORD YOUR SISTER IN LAW IS AN INFAMOUS WOMAN WHO WISHED TO HAVE YOU KILLED THAT SHE MIGHT INHERIT YOUR WEALTH
WOULD SHOW THAT HE HAD MADE THE ATLANTIC VOYAGE THERE IS SOME FAINT EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD EVEN BEEN TO BRAZIL
D'ARTAGNAN AND I OR RATHER TO OBSERVE THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER I AND D'ARTAGNAN
IT WAS ONLY THIS I HAD A DREAM AND I RELATED IT TO HER YEZ YEZ SAID THE SWISS IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO DELL A DREAM BUT I NEFFER DREAM
CONFIDING IN THE ADDRESS OF BAZIN MADE A POMPOUS EULOGIUM ON HIS CANDIDATE FINALLY D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENTIRE FAITH IN THE BRAVERY OF PLANCHET AND REMINDED THEM OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF
THE SITUATION OF THE PORT HAS MADE IT A NURSERY OF HARDY SEAMEN THE TOWN STANDS UPON A LITTLE PROMONTORY THAT JUTS OUT AS A PENINSULA INTO THE OCEAN THE TIDE POURS IN AND OUT OF THE HARBOUR THUS FORMED
THAT WILL REDUCE THE SUM TO FIVE THOUSAND LIVRES
AND THAT THIS ADVENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SAILING OF OTHER NORMAN SHIPS FOR THE SAME GOAL WE HAVE HOWEVER NO RECORD OF CARTIER AND HIS ACTUAL DOINGS UNTIL WE FIND HIS NAME IN AN ENTRY ON THE BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO
IN THE TICKLISH AFFAIR OF BOULOGNE THESE FOUR VIRTUES DISPUTED THE PRIZE FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AND GAVE BIRTH TO MAGNIFICENT SPEECHES WHICH WE DO NOT REPEAT HERE FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED TOO LONG
AND SOUGHT SHELTER UPON THE SEA GIRT PROMONTORY WHICH HAS SINCE BORNE THE NAME OF AARON'S ROCK AARON FOUNDED A SETTLEMENT TO THE SAME PLACE CAME ABOUT TWENTY YEARS LATER
WELL REPLIED THE LATTER BLUSHING WHAT MUST I SAY
LIFE IS A CHAPLET OF LITTLE MISERIES WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER COUNTS WITH A SMILE BE PHILOSOPHERS AS I AM GENTLEMEN SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND LET US DRINK
WHO WAS AN OPTIMIST WHEN THINGS WERE CONCERNED AND A PESSIMIST WHEN MEN WERE IN QUESTION THEY WILL PROMISE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY AND ON THE ROAD FEAR WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ACTING ONCE TAKEN THEY WILL BE PRESSED WHEN PRESSED THEY WILL CONFESS EVERYTHING
NEFFER NEFFER
A FAMILY AFFAIR WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL A FAMILY AFFAIR CONCERNED NOBODY PEOPLE MIGHT EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN A FAMILY AFFAIR BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
MY LORD DO YOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE GOAT PASTURE OF THE LUXEMBOURG GOOD THE LUXEMBOURG ONE MIGHT BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALLUSION TO THE QUEEN MOTHER
HE STOOD AS GODFATHER TO HIS NEPHEW
BUT REMEMBER ALSO THAT IF BY YOUR FAULT ANY EVIL HAPPENS TO D'ARTAGNAN I WILL FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING UP YOUR BELLY
HE THINKS IT HIS DUTY TO RESPOND TO THAT FRIENDSHIP BY SENDING YOU IMPORTANT INFORMATION TWICE YOU HAVE NEARLY BEEN THE VICTIM OF A NEAR RELATIVE WHOM YOU BELIEVE TO BE YOUR HEIR BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT THAT BEFORE SHE CONTRACTED A MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT OUR FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN HAS ADDED ANY OF HIS OWN TO THE AMOUNT BUT GENTLEMEN IN ALL THIS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DO NOT THINK OF THE QUEEN LET US TAKE SOME HEED OF THE WELFARE OF HER DEAR BUCKINGHAM THAT IS THE LEAST WE OWE HER
WERE SENDING FORTH ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN TO PLY THEIR TRADE AMONG THE FOGS OF THE GREAT BANKS OF THE NEW LAND THE BRETON BOY WHOM WE MAY IMAGINE WANDERING ABOUT THE CROWDED WHARVES OF THE LITTLE HARBOUR
THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT APPEARS IN THE FORM OF A MEDALLION OR RING SHAPED ILLUSTRATION IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE MODERN WORKS UPON THE GREAT ADVENTURER BUT HERE AGAIN WE HAVE NO PROOFS OF IDENTITY
AND ROSE IN HIS TURN WITH A NERVOUS MOVEMENT HE COULD NOT REPRESS THE DAY HOWEVER PASSED AWAY AND THE EVENING CAME ON SLOWLY BUT FINALLY IT CAME THE BARS WERE FILLED WITH DRINKERS
YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT I AM TIRED OF FEARING WHEN I OPEN A FRESH BOTTLE THAT THE WINE MAY COME FROM THE CELLAR OF MILADY
HERE FOR CENTURIES HAS DWELT A RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN AND NAVIGATORS WHOSE DARING IS UNSURPASSED BY ANY OTHER SEAFARING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HISTORY
D'ARTAGNAN ALREADY WORE HIS UNIFORM FOR BEING NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS ARAMIS AND AS ARAMIS WAS SO LIBERALLY PAID BY THE PUBLISHER WHO PURCHASED HIS POEM AS TO ALLOW HIM TO BUY EVERYTHING DOUBLE HE SOLD HIS FRIEND A COMPLETE OUTFIT
AND ACT SO THAT WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME HEAR YOU SPOKEN OF MARIE MICHON AND WHAT DREAM DOES SHE MEAN ASKED THE DRAGOON WHO HAD APPROACHED DURING THE READING YEZ WHAT'S THE DREAM SAID THE SWISS
AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE LONG BEFORE THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE TWO FACES PERHAPS INDICATES THE EXISTENCE OF SOME DEFINITE AND GENUINE PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER OF WHICH THE RECORD HAS BEEN LOST
WHO APPEARS TO ME TO BE A VERY GOOD LAD BUT IF HE DOES NOT COME SAID D'ARTAGNAN WELL IF HE DOES NOT COME IT WILL BE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN DELAYED THAT'S ALL HE MAY HAVE FALLEN FROM HIS HORSE HE MAY HAVE CUT A CAPER FROM THE DECK
YOU SPEAK LIKE THE APOCALYPSE AND YOU ARE AS TRUE AS THE GOSPEL THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO DO BUT TO PUT THE ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER THAT IS EASILY DONE SAID ARAMIS HE FOLDED THE LETTER FANCIFULLY AND TOOK UP HIS PEN AND WROTE
AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO MILADY'S BROTHER WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO THE CLEVER PERSON AT TOURS AND WHICH SHOULD BE THE LACKEYS TO CARRY THE LETTERS EVERYONE OFFERED HIS OWN
AND DOES THE HUSBAND OF THIS FRIGHTFUL CREATURE STILL LIVE SAID ARAMIS HE STILL LIVES ARE YOU QUITE SURE OF IT I AM HE
AND AS IF HE BREATHED HIS CUSTOMARY ATMOSPHERE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY IN PARTICULAR THESE SIGNS WERE SO STRONG IN D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT THEY COULD NOT REMAIN QUIET IN ONE PLACE AND WANDERED ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS ON THE ROAD BY WHICH PLANCHET WAS EXPECTED
AND HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF I HAVE THE NOTE
SHE WAS MARRIED ASKED ARAMIS YES
MIGHT FIND BEHIND THE COASTS AND ISLANDS NOW REVEALED TO EUROPE IN THE WESTERN SEA THE HALF FABLED EMPIRES OF CIPANGO AND CATHAY
APPEAR ON THE REGISTERS OF SAINT MALO SAINT BRIAC AND OTHER PLACES IN SOME PROFUSION DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE FAMILY SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT ALTHOUGH NOT MANY YEARS AGO
REPUDIATED BY HER HUSBAND SAID ATHOS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN BRANDED CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN BAH CRIED PORTHOS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER BROTHER IN LAW KILLED YES
THAT THE IMAGE WHICH HAD LAIN HIDDEN FOR GENERATIONS BEHIND THE WOODWORK OF THE OLD CANADIAN HOUSE IS INDEED THAT OF THE GREAT DISCOVERER BESIDE THE INITIALS IS CARVED THE DATE SEVENTEEN O FOUR
HE CREDITED THIS WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO HIM THE EQUAL OF A DEMON WITH AGENTS AS SUPERNATURAL AS HERSELF AT THE LEAST NOISE HE IMAGINED HIMSELF ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED AND THAT PLANCHET WAS BEING BROUGHT BACK TO BE CONFRONTED WITH HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
IN FANCY AT LEAST SUPPOSE THAT THIS FORLORN LITTLE SAVAGE WITH THE REGAL TITLE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHOM THE NAVIGATOR AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS DAY HAD BROUGHT HOME AS LIVING EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE STRANGE LANDS THAT HE HAD SEEN
SAINT MALO BECAME FAMOUS AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORSAIRS OF THE NORTHERN COAST THESE HAD SUCCEEDED THE VIKINGS OF AN EARLIER DAY AND THEY SHOWED A HARDIHOOD AND A RECKLESS DARING EQUAL TO THAT OF THEIR PREDECESSORS LATER ON
DOUBTLESS SAID ARAMIS FOR WE NOT ONLY REQUIRE TO BE WELL SERVED IN ORDER TO SUCCEED BUT MOREOVER NOT TO FAIL FOR IN CASE OF FAILURE HEADS ARE IN QUESTION NOT FOR OUR LACKEYS
FAMILY AFFAIR ARAMIS HAD DISCOVERED THE IDEA THE LACKEYS PORTHOS HAD DISCOVERED THE MEANS THE DIAMOND D'ARTAGNAN ALONE HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING HE ORDINARILY THE MOST INVENTIVE OF THE FOUR
RAVAGED BY PERHAPS TWO CENTURIES OF WIND AND WEATHER THE OLD HOUSE AFFORDED BUT LITTLE SHELTER AGAINST THE BOISTEROUS GALES AND THE BITTER COLD OF THE RUDE CLIMATE OF THE GULF
UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED MY DREAM THE SUN WAS LOOKING VERY GRAVE AND THE MOON REFLECTED HIS CONCERN THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME AT LENGTH THE SUN SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
FOR AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT IS NOT DARK THERE ALL NIGHT LONG WHEN THE SKY IS UNCLOUDED AWAY IN THE NORTH WAS THE GREAT BEAR I KNEW THAT CONSTELLATION FOR BY IT ONE OF THE MEN HAD TAUGHT ME TO FIND THE POLE STAR
OR RATHER FAMOUS IN ALL RENOWN JUST CONSIDER CAN THAT WANT RENOWN WHICH HAS BEEN AGREED TO BE LACKING IN NOTHING TO BE SUPREME IN POWER
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING
I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL
I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD
I GAZED AT THAT PALE FADED LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS NEAR ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT GOD IS THEN AS I KNOW NOW AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THEN WHICH WAS NEITHER MUCH NOR OFTEN
THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME
HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY
FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING HUNGRY I WENT OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR INTO THE CLOSE OR FARMYARD AND RAN ACROSS TO THE HOUSE NO ONE WAS THERE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES
WERE ALL THESE MEMBERS COMPOSING HAPPINESS THEY WOULD DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THIS IS THE NATURE OF PARTS
AND SINCE HE CANNOT RID HIMSELF OF THESE INCONVENIENCES EVEN CEASES TO HAVE THAT POWER WHICH WAS HIS WHOLE END AND AIM IN LIKE MANNER MAY WE CAST UP THE RECKONING IN CASE OF RANK
BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO FEEL FOR HIM
AND THE DESOLATION OF THIS NIGHT WAS MY KEY TO THAT DREAM ONCE MORE I AWOKE TO A SENSE OF MISERY AND STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS CRYING PAPA PAPA THE SAME MOMENT I FOUND MY FATHER'S ARMS AROUND ME
AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
THE STARS WERE HIGH UP AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND MOON AT ALL AND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME YET THERE WAS A GRANDEUR IN MY DESOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ELEVATED MY HEART BUT FOR THE FEAR
AS THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH SINCE THEN ALL THINGS ARE SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD IT IS NOT THESE SO MUCH AS GOOD ITSELF THAT IS SOUGHT BY ALL
NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS
HE FOLDED ME CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HUSH RANALD MY BOY HERE I AM YOU ARE QUITE SAFE I NESTLED AS CLOSE TO HIM AS I COULD GO AND WEPT FOR BLESSEDNESS OH PAPA I SOBBED
HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO
BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE
A WEAKLING VOID OF STRENGTH VEXED BY DISTRESSES MEAN AND DESPISED AND BURIED IN OBSCURITY HE AGAIN WHO THIRSTS ALONE FOR POWER SQUANDERS HIS WEALTH
BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I
THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU MY BOY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BETWEEN MY NARRATIVE AND MY REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONINGS HE HAD SOON GATHERED THE WHOLE STORY
DOES NOT EVEN LAY HOLD OF THAT ONE WHICH HE MAKES HIS AIM WELL SAID I WHAT THEN SUPPOSE ANYONE DESIRE TO OBTAIN THEM TOGETHER
EMERALD GREEN AND GLISTERING WHITE
BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS
OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER
SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY
WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING OF GOD WHO IS SUPREME OF ALL THINGS WHO WAS THERE TO JOIN THESE DISTINCT ESSENCES FINALLY WHEN ONE THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER THE THINGS SO CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
CERTAINLY NOT RIGHT FOR IF THERE IS ANY FEEBLENESS OF STRENGTH IN ANYTHING IN THIS THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE NEED OF EXTERNAL PROTECTION THAT IS SO ACCORDINGLY
EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
I POSSESSED MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO RUN FIRST TO KIRSTY'S PRESS AND SECURE A GOOD SUPPLY OF OATCAKE WITH WHICH I THEN SPED LIKE A HUNTED HARE TO HER FORM
TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD
THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN
THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD
TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP
WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
REFLECT ALSO SAID SHE WHETHER THE SAME CONCLUSION IS NOT FURTHER CONFIRMED BY CONSIDERING THAT THERE CANNOT BE TWO SUPREME GOODS DISTINCT ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THE GOODS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT
INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
EVERYBODY BESIDES ME WAS ASLEEP ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAD ABANDONED ME TO MY FATE WHATEVER MIGHT COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO SEIZE ME WHEN I GOT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE STONE WALL
THAT GOD AND TRUE HAPPINESS ARE ONE AND THE SAME YES SAID I THEN WE CAN SAFELY CONCLUDE ALSO THAT GOD'S ESSENCE IS SEATED IN ABSOLUTE GOOD AND NOWHERE ELSE
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
IF I HAD HAD ONE LIVING CREATURE NIGH ME IF ONLY THE STUPID CALF WHOSE DULL SLEEPY LOW STARTLED ME SO DREADFULLY AS I STOOD STARING ABOUT ME
AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
EVEN TO GO OUT AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR I FORGOT HOW SOUNDLY AND PEACEFULLY I HAD SLEPT IN IT I STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT WITH THE GRASS OF THE CORN YARD UNDER MY FEET
OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER
MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS
SOMETHING MOVED ME TO CLIMB ON THE FORM AND LOOK OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW FROM WHICH I COULD SEE THE MANSE AND THE ROAD FROM IT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS MISSUS MITCHELL COMING TOWARDS THE FARM
AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
OR WEIGHT OF WATERS WHELM THE EARTH THOU JOINEST AND DIFFUSEST THROUGH THE WHOLE LINKING ACCORDANTLY ITS SEVERAL PARTS A SOUL OF THREEFOLD NATURE MOVING ALL
CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS
DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED
AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES
I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
ABOVE IT SHONE THE SPEECHLESS STARS NOTHING WAS ALIVE NOTHING WOULD SPEAK I WENT UP THE FEW ROUGH HEWN GRANITE
FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT
BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE
IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE
TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE
HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED
ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE
AND I IN MY TURN LEARNED THE DISMAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHEN I DID NOT APPEAR KIRSTY TOLD WHAT SHE KNEW THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT FIND ME AND GREAT AS MY MISERY HAD BEEN
NEARLY UNDER IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN CREEPING ROUND BY THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SPOT IN THE EAST WHERE HE WOULD RISE AGAIN
OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
THE WARM TIDE OF COURAGE BEGAN AGAIN TO FLOW FROM MY HEART I OPENED THIS DOOR TOO VERY QUIETLY FOR WAS NOT THE DRAGON ASLEEP DOWN BELOW PAPA PAPA I CRIED IN AN EAGER WHISPER
GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
THE HIGHEST POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND PLEASURE WHAT THEN ARE ALL THESE GOODS INDEPENDENCE POWER AND THE REST TO BE DEEMED MEMBERS OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE
ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK
WAS WE AGREED HAPPINESS WHEREFORE THUS ALSO IT APPEARS THAT IT IS HAPPINESS ALONE WHICH IS SOUGHT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR THAT THE ESSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF HAPPINESS
BUT WHAT WAS MY DISMAY TO FIND THAT EVEN WHEN MY HAND WENT OUT INTO SPACE NO LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE OPENING WHAT COULD IT MEAN SURELY I HAD NOT GROWN BLIND WHILE I LAY ASLEEP
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST
THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD
BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT
IT SEEMED AS IF IN THE AGONY OF THEIR TALK THEIR COUNTENANCES WOULD GO TO PIECES FOR THE STARS THEY DARTED ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER GATHERED INTO GROUPS DISPERSED AND FORMED NEW GROUPS
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
FOR THE VERY REASON WHY INDEPENDENCE IS SOUGHT IS THAT IT IS JUDGED GOOD AND SO POWER ALSO BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED TO BE GOOD THE SAME TOO MAY BE SUPPOSED OF REVERENCE OF RENOWN AND OF PLEASANT DELIGHT
I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR
THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CALLED IMPERFECT IS SPOKEN OF AS IMPERFECT BY REASON OF THE PRIVATION OF SOME PERFECTION
OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE
OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT
OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE
NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS
HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE
WHERE IS MY BENCH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR MY BENCH AND I CAN'T FIND IT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH MY WORK TIME PRESSES I MUST FINISH THOSE SHOES THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR HEARTS DIED WITHIN THEM COME
THEN ISSUING FROM THE OBSCURE CORNER FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER MOVED SYDNEY CARTON CAME AND TOOK HER UP ONLY HER FATHER AND MISTER LORRY WERE WITH HER HIS ARM TREMBLED AS IT RAISED HER AND SUPPORTED HER HEAD YET
DON'T SUFFER FOR ME A PARTING BLESSING FOR OUR CHILD I SEND IT TO HER BY YOU I KISS HER BY YOU I SAY FAREWELL TO HER BY YOU MY HUSBAND NO A MOMENT HE WAS TEARING HIMSELF APART FROM HER
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
GOT INTO IT AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE THE DRIVER WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE GATEWAY WHERE HE HAD PAUSED IN THE DARK NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF ON WHICH OF THE ROUGH STONES OF THE STREET HER FEET HAD TRODDEN HE LIFTED HER AGAIN
KEEP IT CORKED UP IN A BOTTLE TO SEASON ICE CREAM SYRUP OF LEMON JUICE DISSOLVE THREE POUNDS OF LOAF SUGAR IN THREE QUARTS OF WATER SQUEEZE AND STRAIN LEMONS ENOUGH TO MAKE A QUART OF JUICE BOIL IT SLOWLY WITH THE WATER AND SUGAR AND TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES
DEFARGE BROUGHT HIM THE WINE AND GAVE HIM GOOD EVENING HOW GOOD EVENING OH GOOD EVENING CITIZEN FILLING HIS GLASS AH AND GOOD WINE I DRINK TO THE REPUBLIC
CONSOLATORY TO HER
IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE AGAIN I COMMUNICATE TO HIM THAT SECRET I SMITE THIS BOSOM WITH THESE TWO HANDS AS I SMITE IT NOW AND I TELL HIM DEFARGE I WAS BROUGHT UP AMONG THE FISHERMEN OF THE SEA SHORE
BUT ONLY ELICITED FROM HIS OWN WIFE A REPETITION OF HER LAST REPLY TELL THE WIND AND THE FIRE WHERE TO STOP NOT ME CUSTOMERS ENTERED AND THE GROUP WAS BROKEN UP THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER PAID FOR WHAT HE HAD HAD
IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER FACE WITH HIS LIPS HE MURMURED SOME WORDS THE CHILD WHO WAS NEAREST TO HIM TOLD THEM AFTERWARDS AND TOLD HER GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SHE WAS A HANDSOME OLD LADY THAT SHE HEARD HIM SAY A LIFE YOU LOVE
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
HEAVEN GRANT I MAY CARTON BUT HOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT WILL DEPEND ON YOU AND IT COULD DEPEND ON NO BETTER MAN THIS NEW DENUNCIATION WILL CERTAINLY NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER TO MORROW
I HAVE OBSERVED HER TO DAY AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER OTHER DAYS I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE COURT AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE STREET BY THE PRISON LET ME BUT LIFT MY FINGER SHE SEEMED TO RAISE IT THE LISTENER'S EYES WERE ALWAYS ON HIS PAPER
STRAIN IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND SKIM OFF ALL THE FAT THAT IS ON THE TOP SET IT AWAY TO COOL AND WHEN THE JELLY IS QUITE STIFF WIPE IT WITH A TOWEL TO TAKE OFF ANY GREASE THAT SHOULD REMAIN
IT WAS SILENTLY ACQUIESCED IN AND THEY PASSED HER OVER THE SEATS IN THE HALL TO A RAISED PLACE WHERE HE BY LEANING OVER THE DOCK COULD FOLD HER IN HIS ARMS FAREWELL DEAR DARLING OF MY SOUL
THESE JUDGES AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO YOU AND VERY RECOGNISANT OF YOUR SERVICES ARE THEY NOT NOTHING CONNECTED WITH CHARLES WAS CONCEALED FROM ME I HAD THE STRONGEST ASSURANCES THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND I DID
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE SAID THE PRISONER ALL THINGS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AS THEY HAVE FALLEN OUT IT WAS THE ALWAYS VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO DISCHARGE MY POOR MOTHER'S TRUST THAT FIRST BROUGHT MY FATAL PRESENCE NEAR YOU GOOD COULD NEVER COME OF SUCH EVIL
WILL SUBMIT HIMSELF TO HER DO YOU NOT I AM SURE OF IT I THOUGHT SO QUIETLY AND STEADILY HAVE ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN THE COURTYARD HERE EVEN TO THE TAKING OF YOUR OWN SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE
CARTON TOOK IT UP AND THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER IN IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS HE SAID MISTER LORRY NODDED HIS CONSENT HE OPENED IT AND EXCLAIMED THANK GOD WHAT IS IT ASKED MISTER LORRY EAGERLY
LET ME GET TO WORK GIVE ME MY WORK RECEIVING NO ANSWER HE TORE HIS HAIR AND BEAT HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND LIKE A DISTRACTED CHILD DON'T TORTURE A POOR FORLORN WRETCH HE IMPLORED THEM WITH A DREADFUL CRY BUT GIVE ME MY WORK
THEY SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE AS THEY WOULD HAVE USED IF THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING BY A SICK BED IN THE NIGHT CARTON STOOPED TO PICK UP THE COAT WHICH LAY ALMOST ENTANGLING HIS FEET
WHILE SHE ONLY FAINTS OH CARTON CARTON DEAR CARTON CRIED LITTLE LUCIE SPRINGING UP AND THROWING HER ARMS PASSIONATELY ROUND HIM IN A BURST OF GRIEF NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME I THINK YOU WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP MAMMA
PUT A QUART OF WATER BOIL IT DOWN TO A PINT AND STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG ADD SOME SUGAR AND WINE STIR IT AND PUT IT IN GLASSES BLANCMANGE SHAVE AN OUNCE OF ISINGLASS AND DISSOLVE IT IN BOILING WATER
AND HAD ONLY LEFT HER FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COME AND KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT HER FATHER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE QUITTED THE BANKING HOUSE TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK SHE HAD SOME FAINT HOPES THAT HIS MEDIATION MIGHT SAVE CHARLES BUT THEY WERE VERY SLIGHT
HE BENT OVER THE CHILD AND LAID HER BLOOMING CHEEK AGAINST HIS FACE HE PUT HER GENTLY FROM HIM AND LOOKED AT HER UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER BEFORE I GO HE SAID AND PAUSED I MAY KISS HER
HAVING ASCERTAINED ITS SITUATION CARTON CAME OUT OF THOSE CLOSER STREETS AGAIN AND DINED AT A PLACE OF REFRESHMENT AND FELL SOUND ASLEEP AFTER DINNER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HE HAD NO STRONG DRINK
HIS LONELY DAUGHTER BEREFT OF HER FINAL HOPE AND RELIANCE APPEALED TO THEM BOTH TOO STRONGLY AGAIN AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH ONE MEANING IN THEIR FACES CARTON WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
SOMETHING TO SAVE PAPA O LOOK AT HER DEAR CARTON
AND THEN FOR ENGLAND WHY THEN SAID MISTER LORRY GRASPING HIS EAGER BUT SO FIRM AND STEADY HAND IT DOES NOT ALL DEPEND ON ONE OLD MAN BUT I SHALL HAVE A YOUNG AND ARDENT MAN AT MY SIDE BY THE HELP OF HEAVEN YOU SHALL
ICE CREAM WITH FRUIT MIX THE JUICE OF THE FRUIT WITH AS MUCH SUGAR AS WILL BE WANTED BEFORE YOU ADD THE CREAM WHICH NEED NOT BE VERY RICH POKEBERRY JUICE TO STAIN ICES MASH AND STRAIN RIPE POKEBERRIES
OF THE RESTLESS FINGERS AND THE CROAKING VOICE THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN UPON THE JURY STOOD DRINKING AT THE LITTLE COUNTER IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFARGES MAN AND WIFE THE VENGEANCE ASSISTED IN THE CONVERSATION LIKE A REGULAR MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
HE RETURNED THE ANSWER IN GREAT TROUBLE AND VERY SLOWLY TRY THEM AGAIN THE HOURS BETWEEN THIS AND TO MORROW AFTERNOON ARE FEW AND SHORT BUT TRY I INTEND TO TRY I WILL NOT REST A MOMENT
AND STRAIN IT TO A PINT OF THIS JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL IT TILL IT IS A RICH SYRUP AND KEEP IT CORKED UP IN BOTTLES TO SEASON ICE CREAM ALMOND CREAM TAKE A POUND OF BLANCHED ALMONDS AND ROLL THEM FINE WITH A BOTTLE
AND CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRCASE TO THEIR ROOMS THERE HE LAID HER DOWN ON A COUCH WHERE HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS WEPT OVER HER DON'T RECALL HER TO HERSELF HE SAID SOFTLY TO THE LATTER SHE IS BETTER SO DON'T REVIVE HER TO CONSCIOUSNESS
ALL OF PITY THAT HAD A FLUSH OF PRIDE IN IT SHALL I TAKE HER TO A COACH I SHALL NEVER FEEL HER WEIGHT HE CARRIED HER LIGHTLY TO THE DOOR AND LAID HER TENDERLY DOWN IN A COACH HER FATHER AND THEIR OLD FRIEND
I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE REPEATED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND ANGRILY YES I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE TO BE NOT THE FACE OF A TRUE FRIEND OF THE REPUBLIC LET HIM TAKE CARE OF HIS FACE
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
AND TO LET IT FALL WITH A RATTLE ON THE LEDGE BEFORE HER AS IF THE AXE HAD DROPPED THE CITIZENESS IS SUPERB CROAKED THE JURYMAN SHE IS AN ANGEL SAID THE VENGEANCE AND EMBRACED HER
PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
NOW TAKE THIS PAPER THAT DOCTOR MANETTE HAS CARRIED ABOUT HIM IT IS A SIMILAR CERTIFICATE ENABLING HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER AND HER CHILD AT ANY TIME TO PASS THE BARRIER AND THE FRONTIER YOU SEE YES
BOTH HER HEARERS DERIVED A HORRIBLE ENJOYMENT FROM THE DEADLY NATURE OF HER WRATH THE LISTENER COULD FEEL HOW WHITE SHE WAS WITHOUT SEEING HER AND BOTH HIGHLY COMMENDED IT DEFARGE A WEAK MINORITY INTERPOSED A FEW WORDS FOR THE MEMORY OF THE COMPASSIONATE WIFE OF THE MARQUIS
WHO HAD DONE WITH IT IT WAS AS LATE AS SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE AWOKE REFRESHED AND WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS AGAIN AS HE PASSED ALONG TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE HE STOPPED AT A SHOP WINDOW WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR
AS THAT BASTILLE PAPER DESCRIBES IS MY FAMILY DEFARGE THAT SISTER OF THE MORTALLY WOUNDED BOY UPON THE GROUND WAS MY SISTER THAT HUSBAND WAS MY SISTER'S HUSBAND THAT UNBORN CHILD WAS THEIR CHILD
TO ONE PINT OF CALF'S FOOT JELLY ADD A PINT OF CREAM A LITTLE MACE AND A QUARTER OF A POUND OF LOAF SUGAR BOIL IT FIFTEEN MINUTES STIRRING IT CONSTANTLY STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG AND WHEN NEARLY COLD PUT IN N GLASS OF WHITE WINE
TO SO UNHAPPY A BEGINNING BE COMFORTED AND FORGIVE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS HE WAS DRAWN AWAY HIS WIFE RELEASED HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH HER HANDS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
YES RETURNED MISTER LORRY DRYING HIS EYES YOU ARE RIGHT BUT HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE YES HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE ECHOED CARTON
THE WRETCHED WIFE OF THE INNOCENT MAN THUS DOOMED TO DIE FELL UNDER THE SENTENCE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MORTALLY STRICKEN BUT SHE UTTERED NO SOUND AND SO STRONG WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HER REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS SHE OF ALL THE WORLD WHO MUST UPHOLD HIM IN HIS MISERY
FOR OTHER CRIMES AS TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS I HAVE THIS RACE A LONG TIME ON MY REGISTER DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION AND EXTERMINATION ASK MY HUSBAND IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE WITHOUT BEING ASKED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DAYS
TO EACH PINT OF JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL THEM TOGETHER TILL IT BECOMES A JELLY WHEN COLD PUT IT IN A JAR AND TIE IT CLOSE USE A SMALL QUANTITY OF THIS TO STAIN ICE CREAM OR JELLY
AND PEACH KERNELS POUR BOILING WATER ON THEM WHICH WILL MAKE THEM PEEL EASILY EITHER ROLL THEM WITH A BOTTLE ON THE CAKE BOARD OR POUND IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOAF SUGAR THEY SHOULD NOT BE POUNDED TOO MUCH OR THEY WILL BE OILY
PERPLEXEDLY COUNTED HIS CHANGE AND ASKED AS A STRANGER TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE NATIONAL PALACE MADAME DEFARGE TOOK HIM TO THE DOOR AND PUT HER ARM ON HIS IN POINTING OUT THE ROAD
HE HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIVE HOURS GONE WHERE COULD HE BE MISTER LORRY WAITED UNTIL TEN BUT DOCTOR MANETTE NOT RETURNING AND HE BEING UNWILLING TO LEAVE LUCIE ANY LONGER IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO HER AND COME TO THE BANKING HOUSE AGAIN AT MIDNIGHT
AS TO THEE PURSUED MADAME IMPLACABLY ADDRESSING HER HUSBAND IF IT DEPENDED ON THEE WHICH HAPPILY IT DOES NOT THOU WOULDST RESCUE THIS MAN EVEN NOW NO PROTESTED DEFARGE
THE MOMENT I COME TO YOU TAKE ME IN AND DRIVE AWAY I UNDERSTAND THAT I WAIT FOR YOU UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU HAVE MY CERTIFICATE IN YOUR HAND WITH THE REST YOU KNOW AND WILL RESERVE MY PLACE WAIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO HAVE MY PLACE OCCUPIED
EARLY TO MORROW HAVE YOUR HORSES READY SO THAT THEY MAY BE IN STARTING TRIM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT SHALL BE DONE HIS MANNER WAS SO FERVENT AND INSPIRING THAT MISTER LORRY CAUGHT THE FLAME AND WAS AS QUICK AS YOUTH YOU ARE A NOBLE HEART
TAKE A BUCKET OF ICE AND POUND IT FINE MIX WITH IT TWO QUARTS OF SALT PUT YOUR CREAM IN A FREEZER COVER IT CLOSE AND IMMERSE IT IN THE BUCKET DRAW THE ICE ROUND IT SO AS TO TOUCH EVERY PART AFTER IT HAS BEEN IN A FEW MINUTES PUT IN A SPOON AND STIR IT FROM THE EDGE TO THE CENTRE
DID I SAY WE COULD DEPEND UPON NO BETTER MAN TELL HER TO NIGHT WHAT YOU KNOW OF HER DANGER AS INVOLVING HER CHILD AND HER FATHER DWELL UPON THAT FOR SHE WOULD LAY HER OWN FAIR HEAD BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S CHEERFULLY
CAN POSSIBLY BE SAVED AND MANY LIVES MUST INEVITABLY BE SACRIFICED I WILL REMEMBER THEM I HOPE TO DO MY PART FAITHFULLY AND I HOPE TO DO MINE NOW GOOD BYE
A MOMENT LET ME SPEAK OF IT IN ITS PLACE FIRST HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS COAT AND TOOK ANOTHER PAPER FROM IT THAT IS THE CERTIFICATE WHICH ENABLES ME TO PASS OUT OF THIS CITY LOOK AT IT YOU SEE SYDNEY CARTON AN ENGLISHMAN
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
AND EXACT THE PROMISE I AM GOING TO EXACT I HAVE A REASON A GOOD ONE I DO NOT DOUBT IT ANSWERED MISTER LORRY SAY ON THE FIGURE IN THE CHAIR BETWEEN THEM WAS ALL THE TIME MONOTONOUSLY ROCKING ITSELF TO AND FRO AND MOANING
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
EXTERMINATION IS GOOD DOCTRINE MY WIFE SAID DEFARGE RATHER TROUBLED IN GENERAL I SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT THIS DOCTOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN HIM TO DAY YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE WHEN THE PAPER WAS READ
THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS REFLECTIONS THEN THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DEED TO SEIZE THAT ARM LIFT IT AND STRIKE UNDER IT SHARP AND DEEP BUT HE WENT HIS WAY AND WAS SOON SWALLOWED UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE PRISON WALL
THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
IT IS A SOUND PRECAUTION AND MAY BE A NECESSARY PREPARATION BUT CARE CARE CARE LET ME THINK IT OUT CHECKING HIS STEPS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TEND TOWARDS AN OBJECT
AFTER LOOKING AT HER AS IF THE SOUND OF EVEN A SINGLE FRENCH WORD WERE SLOW TO EXPRESS ITSELF TO HIM HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER STRONG FOREIGN ACCENT YES MADAME YES I AM ENGLISH
AND WITH A RADIANT LOOK UPON HER FACE IN WHICH THERE WAS EVEN A COMFORTING SMILE AS HE WENT OUT AT THE PRISONERS DOOR SHE TURNED LAID HER HEAD LOVINGLY ON HER FATHER'S BREAST TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND FELL AT HIS FEET
YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
SINCE LAST NIGHT HE HAD TAKEN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE LIGHT THIN WINE
THAT BROTHER WAS MY BROTHER THAT FATHER WAS MY FATHER
WE KNOW NOW WHAT YOU UNDERWENT WHEN YOU SUSPECTED MY DESCENT AND WHEN YOU KNEW IT WE KNOW NOW THE NATURAL ANTIPATHY YOU STROVE AGAINST AND CONQUERED FOR HER DEAR SAKE
OF LITTLE WORTH AS LIFE IS WHEN WE MISUSE IT IT IS WORTH THAT EFFORT IT WOULD COST NOTHING TO LAY DOWN IF IT WERE NOT I WILL GO SAID DOCTOR MANETTE TO THE PROSECUTOR AND THE PRESIDENT STRAIGHT
MISTER LORRY SAW HIM SHRINK INTO THE EXACT FIGURE THAT DEFARGE HAD HAD IN KEEPING AFFECTED AND IMPRESSED WITH TERROR AS THEY BOTH WERE BY THIS SPECTACLE OF RUIN IT WAS NOT A TIME TO YIELD TO SUCH EMOTIONS
AND THEN ADVANCED TO HIM HERSELF AND ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS HE HAD ORDERED HE REPEATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID ENGLISH ASKED MADAME DEFARGE INQUISITIVELY RAISING HER DARK EYEBROWS
THEY WERE DISCUSSING THIS QUESTION AND WERE ALMOST BUILDING UP SOME WEAK STRUCTURE OF HOPE ON HIS PROLONGED ABSENCE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM ON THE STAIRS THE INSTANT HE ENTERED THE ROOM IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALL WAS LOST
MY PARTING BLESSING ON MY LOVE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN WHERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST THEY WERE HER HUSBAND'S WORDS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS BOSOM I CAN BEAR IT DEAR CHARLES I AM SUPPORTED FROM ABOVE
ONE GALLON OF CREAM TWO POUNDS ROLLED LOAF SUGAR ONE TEA SPOONFUL OF OIL OF LEMON IF FOR VANILLA CREAM USE A TABLE SPOONFUL OF TINCTURE OF VANILLA TWO EGGS BEATEN MIX WELL AND FREEZE IN THE USUAL WAY
WHEN THE BASTILLE FALLS HE FINDS THIS PAPER OF TO DAY AND HE BRINGS IT HOME AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THIS PLACE IS CLEAR AND SHUT WE READ IT HERE ON THIS SPOT BY THE LIGHT OF THIS LAMP ASK HIM IS THAT SO
AND I WILL GO TO OTHERS WHOM IT IS BETTER NOT TO NAME I WILL WRITE TOO AND BUT STAY THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN THE STREETS AND NO ONE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE UNTIL DARK
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
FOR THE SAKE OF HER CHILD AND HER FATHER PRESS UPON HER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING PARIS WITH THEM AND YOU AT THAT HOUR TELL HER THAT IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S LAST ARRANGEMENT

WHEN THE CREAM IS PUT IN A MOULD CLOSE IT AND MOVE IT IN THE ICE AS YOU CANNOT USE A SPOON WITHOUT WASTE ICE CREAM WITH LEMON ROLL TWO FRESH LEMONS IN AS MUCH POWDERED LOAF SUGAR AS WILL SWEETEN A QUART OF CREAM
THE LAST CHANCE IS GONE IT WAS NOT MUCH YES HE HAD BETTER BE TAKEN TO HER BUT BEFORE YOU GO WILL YOU FOR A MOMENT STEADILY ATTEND TO ME DON'T ASK ME WHY I MAKE THE STIPULATIONS I AM GOING TO MAKE
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS
IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
AND THAT SUMMONS TO ANSWER FOR THOSE THINGS DESCENDS TO ME ASK HIM IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE ONCE MORE THEN TELL WIND AND FIRE WHERE TO STOP RETURNED MADAME BUT DON'T TELL ME
SYDNEY CARTON PAUSED IN THE STREET NOT QUITE DECIDED WHERE TO GO AT TELLSON'S BANKING HOUSE AT NINE HE SAID WITH A MUSING FACE SHALL I DO WELL IN THE MEAN TIME TO SHOW MYSELF I THINK SO

DEFARGE WENT BACK TO THE COUNTER AND SAID CERTAINLY A LITTLE LIKE MADAME STERNLY RETORTED I TELL YOU A GOOD DEAL LIKE JACQUES THREE PACIFICALLY REMARKED
AND SLIGHTLY ALTERED THE DISORDERED ARRANGEMENT OF HIS LOOSE CRAVAT AND HIS COAT COLLAR AND HIS WILD HAIR THIS DONE HE WENT ON DIRECT TO DEFARGE'S AND WENT IN THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO CUSTOMER IN THE SHOP BUT JACQUES THREE
WHEN EGGS ARE USED IN CALF'S FOOT AND OTHER JELLIES CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE INGREDIENTS COOL

NOT IF TO LIFT THIS GLASS WOULD DO IT BUT I WOULD LEAVE THE MATTER THERE I SAY STOP THERE SEE YOU THEN JACQUES SAID MADAME DEFARGE WRATHFULLY AND SEE YOU TOO MY LITTLE VENGEANCE SEE YOU BOTH LISTEN
SEASON IT WITH A FEW DROPS OF ESSENCE OF LEMON OR SYRUP OF LEMON PEEL AND POWDERED WHITE SUGAR AND IF YOU CHOOSE A SPOONFUL OF PRESERVE SYRUP AND JUST AS YOU SEND IT TO TABLE
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
MISTER LORRY LEANED HIS ARM UPON THE DOOR POST AND BOWED HIS FACE UPON IT DON'T DESPOND SAID CARTON VERY GENTLY DON'T GRIEVE I ENCOURAGED DOCTOR MANETTE IN THIS IDEA BECAUSE I FELT THAT IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE
WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
ALONG WITH TWO OF THE FOUR MEN WHO HAD TAKEN HIM LAST NIGHT AND BARSAD THE PEOPLE HAD ALL POURED OUT TO THE SHOW IN THE STREETS BARSAD PROPOSED TO THE REST LET HER EMBRACE HIM THEN IT IS BUT A MOMENT
BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US
THE AMIABLE VENGEANCE ADDED WITH A LAUGH YES MY FAITH AND YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE TO SEEING HIM ONCE MORE TO MORROW CARTON FOLLOWED THE LINES AND WORDS OF HIS PAPER WITH A SLOW FOREFINGER
FOLLOWED SYDNEY TO THE OUTER DOOR AND TOUCHING HIM ON THE SHOULDER AS HE WAS GOING AWAY CAUSED HIM TO TURN I HAVE NO HOPE SAID MISTER LORRY IN A LOW AND SORROWFUL WHISPER NOR HAVE I IF ANY ONE OF THESE MEN
ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN DEFIANTLY
STONE DEAD AS FOR MY MOTHER WHEN WE HAD CARRIED HER UP TO THE HAMLET A LITTLE COLD WATER AND SALTS AND THAT SOON BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN AND SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR HER TERROR
THAT IS THE HOUSE OF SHAWS SHE CRIED BLOOD BUILT IT BLOOD STOPPED THE BUILDING OF IT BLOOD SHALL BRING IT DOWN SEE HERE SHE CRIED AGAIN I SPIT UPON THE GROUND AND CRACK MY THUMB AT IT BLACK BE ITS FALL
AND SLOW AS I BEGAN TO TRAVEL I STILL KEPT ASKING MY WAY AND STILL KEPT ADVANCING
BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
OTHERS CROUCH BEFORE THE PUBLIC EDIFICES AND CHURCHES BEING CLEAN SPACIOUS WELL SHADED AND ADORNED WITH MANY ELEGANT MANSIONS
BUT A TRAGEDY CAME IN SPITE OF HIM POOT WAS BENDING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH WALL IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM TO GROW DIZZY AND TUMBLE OFF BEN TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY IF THE FELLOW WITH HIS WEAK HEAD
IN THOSE DAYS FOLK STILL BELIEVED IN WITCHES AND TREMBLED AT A CURSE AND THIS ONE FALLING SO PAT LIKE A WAYSIDE OMEN TO ARREST ME ERE I CARRIED OUT MY PURPOSE TOOK THE PITH OUT OF MY LEGS
AND POINTED TO A GREAT BULK OF BUILDING STANDING VERY BARE UPON A GREEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT VALLEY THE COUNTRY WAS PLEASANT ROUND ABOUT RUNNING IN LOW HILLS PLEASANTLY WATERED AND WOODED AND THE CROPS TO MY EYES WONDERFULLY GOOD
CRIES THE CARTER IN SO SHARP A NOTE THAT HIS VERY HORSE STARTED AND THEN WELL MANNIE HE ADDED IT'S NANE OF MY AFFAIRS BUT YE SEEM A DECENT SPOKEN LAD AND IF YE'LL TAKE A WORD FROM ME YE'LL KEEP CLEAR OF THE SHAWS
NO ROAD LED UP TO IT NO SMOKE AROSE FROM ANY OF THE CHIMNEYS NOR WAS THERE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A GARDEN MY HEART SANK THAT I CRIED THE WOMAN'S FACE LIT UP WITH A MALIGNANT ANGER
AND I MADE OUT EVEN THROUGH THE MIST THAT THE MIDDLE MAN OF THIS TRIO WAS THE BLIND BEGGAR THE NEXT MOMENT HIS VOICE SHOWED ME THAT I WAS RIGHT DOWN WITH THE DOOR HE CRIED AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED TWO OR THREE
IT HAS NO CANAL RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE HOUSES PAINTED IN EVERY VARIETY OF COLOR HAVE A PICTURESQUE EFFECT AS THEY STAND WITH THEIR GABLE ENDS TO THE STREET SOME ARE VERY TALL WITH HALF THEIR HEIGHT IN THEIR STEP LIKE ROOFS
HE STOPPED HIS CART AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE OTHERS AY SAID HE WHAT FOR IT'S A GREAT HOUSE I ASKED DOUBTLESS SAYS HE
BEN AND LAMBERT HAD OFTEN VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SURPRISED AT THE RICHNESS OF THE LEYDEN COLLECTION THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS WEARING APPAREL WEAPONS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS THAT I COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER BUT STOOD STARING AY THE MAN RESUMED HE'LL BE DEAD NO DOUBT AND THAT'LL BE WHAT BRINGS YE CHAPPING TO MY DOOR
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
THEY RESTED AWHILE AND THEN TOOK ANOTHER WHICH FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY CALLED DINNER AFTER DINNER THE BOYS SAT WARMING THEMSELVES AT THE INN ALL BUT PETER WHO OCCUPIED THE TIME IN ANOTHER FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR DOCTOR BOEKMAN
AND WITH A CURIOUS CHANGE OF VOICE THAT THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED
INTERESTED THEM FOR A WHILE AND BEN HAD TO BE ALMOST PULLED AWAY FROM THE DINGY OLD PORTRAIT OF VAN DER WERF THE TOWN HALL AS WELL AS THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IS ON THE BREEDSTRAAT THE LONGEST AND FINEST STREET IN LEYDEN
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IN HIS ADVENTURES AND IF THERE WASN'T THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOK AT THEM HOW FRANTICALLY THEY WHIRL THEIR GREAT ARMS JUST THE THING TO EXCITE THE CRAZY KNIGHT TO MORTAL COMBAT
SAID A VOICE I HAVE COME HERE WITH A LETTER I SAID TO MISTER EBENEZER BALFOUR OF SHAWS IS HE HERE FROM WHOM IS IT ASKED THE MAN WITH THE BLUNDERBUSS THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
AND WE WALKED BACK TO THE HAMLET WHERE THE HORSES WERE
AND THEN RIGHT UP AGAINST THE YELLOW SKY I SAW A SCROLL OF SMOKE GO MOUNTING NOT MUCH THICKER AS IT SEEMED TO ME THAN THE SMOKE OF A CANDLE BUT STILL THERE IT WAS AND MEANT A FIRE AND WARMTH AND COOKERY
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
SO IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN TO THE HOLE THE LUGGER WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY THOUGH STILL CLOSE IN HE HAILED HER A VOICE REPLIED TELLING HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT OR HE WOULD GET SOME LEAD IN HIM
ASCENDED TO A HIGH MOUND WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTER THIS WAS THE SITE OF A ROUND TOWER NOW IN RUINS SAID BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY HENGIST THE ANGLO SAXON KING
FINE BROAD PROMENADES SHADED BY NOBLE TREES BORDER THE CANALS AND ADD TO THE RETIRED APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES BEHIND HEIGHTENING THE EFFECT OF SCHOLASTIC SECLUSION THAT SEEMS TO PERVADE THE PLACE
THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
SQUALLING WAS THE WORD FOR IT PEW'S ANGER ROSE SO HIGH AT THESE OBJECTIONS TILL AT LAST HIS PASSION COMPLETELY TAKING THE UPPER HAND HE STRUCK AT THEM RIGHT AND LEFT IN HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS STICK SOUNDED HEAVILY ON MORE THAN ONE
THE HOUSE IS A BIG MUCKLE HOUSE AY SAID I BUT THE FOLK THAT ARE IN IT FOLK CRIED HE
YET I SAW NO OTHER PRESENTLY IT BROUGHT ME TO STONE UPRIGHTS WITH AN UNROOFED LODGE BESIDE THEM AND COATS OF ARMS UPON THE TOP A MAIN ENTRANCE IT WAS PLAINLY MEANT TO BE BUT NEVER FINISHED INSTEAD OF GATES OF WROUGHT IRON
THE CITY IS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS WATER ROADS FORMED BY THE RIVER RHINE THERE GROWN SLUGGISH FATIGUED BY ITS LONG TRAVEL BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STONE BRIDGES REUNITE THE DISSEVERED STREETS
COMING TO THE TOP OF A HILL I SAW ALL THE COUNTRY FALL AWAY BEFORE ME DOWN TO THE SEA AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESCENT ON A LONG RIDGE
DOWN WENT THE STONE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND LEFT ME SITTING HERE ON TOP WITH BOTH MY FEET IN THE AIR IF I HAD NOT THROWN MYSELF BACK AT THAT MOMENT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE ROLLED OVER AFTER THE STONE WELL IT IS NO MATTER
THERE WAS A FLAG UPON THE CASTLE AND SHIPS MOVING OR LYING ANCHORED IN THE FIRTH BOTH OF WHICH FOR AS FAR AWAY AS THEY WERE I COULD DISTINGUISH CLEARLY AND BOTH BROUGHT MY COUNTRY HEART INTO MY MOUTH PRESENTLY AFTER
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF SPEECH AND NOT A DOG BARKED
ONE TAILING OUT BEHIND THE REST WAS A LAD THAT HAD GONE FROM THE HAMLET TO DOCTOR LIVESEY'S THE REST WERE REVENUE OFFICERS WHOM HE HAD MET BY THE WAY AND WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO RETURN AT ONCE
I WAS IN FULL CAREER WHEN I HEARD THE COUGH RIGHT OVERHEAD AND JUMPING BACK AND LOOKING UP BEHELD A MAN'S HEAD IN A TALL NIGHTCAP AND THE BELL MOUTH OF A BLUNDERBUSS AT ONE OF THE FIRST STOREY WINDOWS IT'S LOADED
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER BUILDING AND HASTILY CLAPPED ON AS A FINISHING TOUCH
HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
SAID I FOR I WAS GROWING VERY WROTH WELL
THIS OVER THE PARTY ONCE MORE PREPARED FOR SKATING
YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
THREATENED HIM IN HORRID TERMS AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CATCH THE STICK AND WREST IT FROM HIS GRASP THIS QUARREL WAS THE SAVING OF US FOR WHILE IT WAS STILL RAGING ANOTHER SOUND CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THE SIDE OF THE HAMLET
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
BUT WHEN I HAD COME SO FAR A WAY ALREADY MERE SHAME WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO DESIST TILL I HAD PUT THE MATTER TO THE TOUCH OF PROOF I WAS BOUND OUT OF MERE SELF RESPECT TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND LITTLE AS I LIKED THE SOUND OF WHAT I HEARD
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
THAN THEY WERE IN THE FACT OF ITS BEING A TRIPTYCH THAT IS PAINTED ON THREE DIVISIONS THE TWO OUTER ONES SWUNG ON HINGES SO AS TO CLOSE WHEN REQUIRED OVER THE MAIN PORTION
THE BETTER TO SET THIS FEAR AT REST I CHANGED THE FORM OF MY INQUIRIES AND SPYING AN HONEST FELLOW COMING ALONG A LANE ON THE SHAFT OF HIS CART I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER HEARD TELL OF A HOUSE THEY CALLED THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
HIM THEY HAD DESERTED WHETHER IN SHEER PANIC OR OUT OF REVENGE FOR HIS ILL WORDS AND BLOWS I KNOW NOT BUT THERE HE REMAINED BEHIND TAPPING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD IN A FRENZY AND GROPING AND CALLING FOR HIS COMRADES
THE FIRE AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD SHOW A MILE AWAY AND THE DOOR OPEN TO A BEGGAR'S KNOCK I CAME FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY NAME SAID I THEY CALL ME DAVID BALFOUR AT THAT I MADE SURE THE MAN STARTED
THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
CRIED THE VOICE SHARPLY I REPEATED WHAT I HAD SAID WHO ARE YE YOURSELF
SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT
CONTAINING PROFESSOR LUZAC'S MEMORIAL AND BOERHAAVE'S MONUMENT OF WHITE AND BLACK MARBLE WITH ITS URN AND CARVED SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE AND ITS MEDALLION OF BOERHAAVE ADORNED WITH HIS FAVORITE MOTTO
THE NEXT PERSON I CAME ACROSS WAS A DAPPER LITTLE MAN IN A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WIG WHOM I SAW TO BE A BARBER ON HIS ROUNDS AND KNOWING WELL THAT BARBERS WERE GREAT GOSSIPS I ASKED HIM PLAINLY WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS MISTER BALFOUR OF THE SHAWS
WHAT SAY I NOT MISTER EBENEZER
AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
AT THAT ANOTHER FELLOW PROBABLY HIM WHO HAD REMAINED BELOW TO SEARCH THE CAPTAIN'S BODY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE INN
SCATTER LADS AND FIND EM SURE ENOUGH THEY LEFT THEIR GLIM HERE SAID THE FELLOW FROM THE WINDOW SCATTER AND FIND EM ROUT THE HOUSE OUT REITERATED PEW STRIKING WITH HIS STICK UPON THE ROAD
HE CRIED WE DON'T SEE IT HERE NOHOW RETURNED THE MAN HERE YOU BELOW THERE IS IT ON BILL CRIED THE BLIND MAN AGAIN
AND SHE WHEN I HAD PUT MY USUAL QUESTION TURNED SHARP ABOUT
HE INTERRUPTED VERY CHEERILY PERFECTLY RIGHT A GENTLEMAN AND A MAGISTRATE AND NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT I MIGHT AS WELL RIDE ROUND THERE MYSELF AND REPORT TO HIM OR SQUIRE MASTER PEW'S DEAD WHEN ALL'S DONE
THE SAME WORLD RENOWNED RIVER DEGRADED FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FREE FLOWING RHINE SERVES AS A MOAT FROM THE RAMPART THAT SURROUNDS LEYDEN AND IS CROSSED BY DRAWBRIDGES AT THE IMPOSING GATEWAYS THAT GIVE ACCESS TO THE CITY
THIS APPEAL SEEMED TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT FOR TWO OF THE FELLOWS BEGAN TO LOOK HERE AND THERE AMONG THE LUMBER BUT HALF HEARTEDLY I THOUGHT AND WITH HALF AN EYE TO THEIR OWN DANGER ALL THE TIME WHILE THE REST STOOD IRRESOLUTE ON THE ROAD
SIMPLEX SIGILLUM VERI THEY ALSO OBTAINED ADMITTANCE TO A TEA GARDEN WHICH IN SUMMER WAS A FAVORITE RESORT OF THE CITIZENS AND PASSING NAKED OAKS AND FRUIT TREES
THE PRIDE OF LIFE SEEMED TO MOUNT INTO MY BRAIN AT THE SIGHT OF THE RED COATS AND THE HEARING OF THAT MERRY MUSIC A LITTLE FARTHER ON
I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
SAID BEN AFTER LAMBERT HAD BEEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ODDITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE SUBURBS IT IS ALL WINDMILLS YOU REMEMBER HIS TERRIFIC CONTEST WITH ONE I SUPPOSE NO SAID LAMBERT BLUNTLY
WHEN THE BOYS LEFT THIS MUSEUM THEY WENT TO ANOTHER AND SAW A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF FOSSIL ANIMALS SKELETONS BIRDS MINERALS PRECIOUS STONES AND OTHER NATURAL SPECIMENS
AND BY OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASTLE OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT COUNTS OF HOLLAND AS THE BOYS WALKED ABOUT ON THE TOP OF ITS STONE WALL THEY COULD GET BUT A POOR VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING CITY
SOME NEWS OF THE LUGGER IN KITT'S HOLE HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO SUPERVISOR DANCE AND SET HIM FORTH THAT NIGHT IN OUR DIRECTION AND TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MY MOTHER AND I OWED OUR PRESERVATION FROM DEATH PEW WAS DEAD
IT BEWILDERS ONE TO LOOK AT THEM HELP ME TO COUNT ALL THOSE WE CAN SEE VAN MOUNEN I WANT A BIG ITEM FOR MY NOTEBOOK AND AFTER A CAREFUL RECKONING
PROMPTLY AFTERWARDS FRESH SOUNDS OF ASTONISHMENT AROSE THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A SLAM AND A JINGLE OF BROKEN GLASS AND A MAN LEANED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND ADDRESSED THE BLIND BEGGAR ON THE ROAD BELOW HIM
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
THEN GENTLY COLLAPSED UPON HIS FACE AND MOVED NO MORE I LEAPED TO MY FEET AND HAILED THE RIDERS THEY WERE PULLING UP AT ANY RATE
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO GET IT PUT IN SAFETY TO BE SURE BOY QUITE RIGHT SAID HE I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I THOUGHT PERHAPS DOCTOR LIVESEY I BEGAN PERFECTLY RIGHT
RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
WAS THIS THE PALACE I HAD BEEN COMING TO WAS IT WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I WAS TO SEEK NEW FRIENDS AND BEGIN GREAT FORTUNES WHY IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ON ESSEN WATERSIDE
IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
JUST THEN THE NOISE OF HORSES TOPPED THE RISE AND FOUR OR FIVE RIDERS CAME IN SIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SWEPT AT FULL GALLOP DOWN THE SLOPE
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
AND I DID IT A BLIND MAN AND I'M TO LOSE MY CHANCE FOR YOU I'M TO BE A POOR CRAWLING BEGGAR SPONGING FOR RUM WHEN I MIGHT BE ROLLING IN A COACH
PETER AND JACOB REGARDED THE BUILDING WITH AN EVEN DEEPER MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR THEY WERE TO ENTER IT AS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS POOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD HAVE RUN A HOPELESS TILT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
AND A RUSH WAS MADE UPON THE ADMIRAL BENBOW THE LANTERN BEARER FOLLOWING AND THEN I COULD SEE THEM PAUSE AND HEAR SPEECHES PASSED IN A LOWER KEY AS IF THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
BEN AS HE SCANNED THE BUILDINGS ON THE RAPENBURG CANAL WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN BUT WHEN HE RECALLED ITS HISTORY HOW ATTENDED WITH ALL THE POMP OF A GRAND CIVIC DISPLAY
IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WING OF A HOUSE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN FINISHED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE INNER END STOOD OPEN ON THE UPPER FLOORS AND SHOWED AGAINST THE SKY WITH STEPS AND STAIRS OF UNCOMPLETED MASONRY MANY OF THE WINDOWS WERE UNGLAZED
THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
I WAS IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RUN AWAY BUT ANGER GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I BEGAN INSTEAD TO RAIN KICKS AND BUFFETS ON THE DOOR
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
BUT THE PAUSE WAS BRIEF FOR THE BLIND MAN AGAIN ISSUED HIS COMMANDS HIS VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER AND HIGHER AS IF HE WERE AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS AND RAGE IN IN IN HE SHOUTED AND CURSED THEM FOR THEIR DELAY
AND FROM ITS EFFECT UPON THE BUCCANEERS A SIGNAL TO WARN THEM OF APPROACHING DANGER THERE'S DIRK AGAIN SAID ONE TWICE WE'LL HAVE TO BUDGE MATES
AT THIS PEW SAW HIS ERROR TURNED WITH A SCREAM AND RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE DITCH INTO WHICH HE ROLLED BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN IN A SECOND AND MADE ANOTHER DASH NOW UTTERLY BEWILDERED RIGHT UNDER THE NEAREST OF THE COMING HORSES
IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AS A TRIBUTE TO THE CITIZENS FOR THE BRAVERY DISPLAYED DURING THE SIEGE WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE GREAT MEN IN RELIGION LEARNING AND SCIENCE WHO HAD ONCE STUDIED THERE
THE TRAMP OF HORSES GALLOPING ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME A PISTOL SHOT FLASH AND REPORT CAME FROM THE HEDGE SIDE AND THAT WAS PLAINLY THE LAST SIGNAL OF DANGER FOR THE BUCCANEERS TURNED AT ONCE AND RAN
AND ANOTHER READY TO FAINT BEN MANAGED TO TURN HIS HEAD HE SAW A CROWD OF BOYS ON THE EDGE OF THE WALL OPPOSITE BUT JACOB WAS NOT THERE GOOD HEAVENS HE CRIED SPRINGING FORWARD WHERE IS MY COUSIN
FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM OBEYED AT ONCE TWO REMAINING ON THE ROAD WITH THE FORMIDABLE BEGGAR THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN A CRY OF SURPRISE AND THEN A VOICE SHOUTING FROM THE HOUSE BILL'S DEAD
FILLED IT IN IMAGINATION WITH GAY SUMMER GROUPS HE TRIED TO FORGET OLD BATTLE CLOUDS AND PICTURE ONLY CURLING WREATHS OF TOBACCO SMOKE RISING FROM AMONG MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENJOYING THEIR TEA AND COFFEE IN THE OPEN AIR
I CAME BY A HOUSE WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND GOT A ROUGH DIRECTION FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CRAMOND AND SO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WORKED MY WAY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE CAPITAL BY COLINTON TILL I CAME OUT UPON THE GLASGOW ROAD AND THERE TO MY GREAT PLEASURE AND WONDER
BY THIS TIME MY EARS HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE QUIET THAT I COULD HEAR THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK INSIDE AS IT SLOWLY COUNTED OUT THE SECONDS BUT WHOEVER WAS IN THAT HOUSE KEPT DEADLY STILL AND MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH
WHAT DO YOU SEE AND FOR MONTHS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER NO HELP I SEE AROUND US NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY BEN PUSHED THESE THOUGHTS AWAY AND RESOLUTELY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BARE TEA GARDEN
PEW HE CRIED THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE US SOMEONE'S TURNED THE CHEST OUT ALOW AND ALOFT IS IT THERE ROARED PEW THE MONEY'S THERE THE BLIND MAN CURSED THE MONEY
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
BUT THE BOYS SPENT A FEW PLEASANT MOMENTS IN THE STADHUIS OR TOWN HALL A LONG IRREGULAR STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT IN THE GOTHIC STYLE UNCOUTH IN ARCHITECTURE BUT PICTURESQUE FROM AGE ITS LITTLE STEEPLE TUNEFUL WITH BELLS
SAW A WEIRD SIGHT CIRCLING AND WHEELING ABOUT IN THE CAMP CLEARING WERE MANY OF THE BLACK SHADOWY FORMS THAT HAD CAUSED NED SUCH ALARM GREAT BATS THEY WERE AND A DANGEROUS SPECIES IF JACINTO WAS TO BE BELIEVED
THE BAT MAKES AN OPENING IN THE SKIN WITH ITS SHARP TEETH AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT THE BLOOD I CAN WELL BELIEVE TWO OR THREE OF THEM ATTACKING A STEER OR MULE AT ONCE COULD SOON WEAKEN IT SO THE ANIMAL WOULD DIE AND A MAN TOO ASKED NED
AND IN THE GLEAM OF IT HE AND NED SAW FLUTTERING ABOUT THE TENT SOME DARK SHADOW LIKE FORM AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH TOM'S CHUM CRIED
THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES A LARGE WILD APPLE TREE BENT OVER IT
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
TOM AND NED KICKED OUTSIDE THE BAT THE FORMER HAD KILLED IN THEIR TENT AND THEN BOTH WENT BACK TO THEIR COTS BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP AND THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO REST
FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
LIKE A PRIMROSE IN A HAILSTORM AT FIRST BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET WITH A SMILE ALWAYS EITHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP IN HIS EYES AND BECAUSE HE NEVER HEEDED THEIR UGLY WORDS AND ROUGH JOKES THEY SAID HE WASN'T ALL THERE
FINALLY THE SCIENTIST SAID OH YES WE MAY FIND AN IDOL I UNDERSTAND THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE SPANIARDS CAME WORSHIPED IDOLS BUT WE SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ANTIQUITIES WE FIND HUH GRUNTED JACINTO
THEY WERE JUST CLEARING THE RUBBISH AWAY DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED AND MADE FOR CHARING CROSS THAT NIGHT THE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD A GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT POOR THINGS SAID THE MOTHER IT'S WORSE FOR THEM THAN IT IS FOR US
AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER ALL EXCEPT THREE ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS
AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER
BUT WHETHER THE SOUND CAME FROM HIS HEAD OR FROM THE HOLLOW TREE THAT NO ONE COULD SAY WITH CERTAINTY SO NOW HE GOT THE PLACE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER AND WROTE YEARLY A SHORT TREATISE ON THE OWL
SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS
FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
HERE YOU HAVE A LIGHT LIKE MINE FLASH IT ON AND HANG IT SOMEWHERE ON YOURSELF THEN GET A CLUB AND COME ON THE LIGHTS WILL BLIND THE BATS AND WE CAN SEE TO HIT EM TOM'S PLAN SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ONE HIS LAMP AND NED'S HAD SMALL HOOKS ON THEM
DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED INSTANTLY FOR HE WAS THE FOREMOST IN THE RANK AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL ONE OR TWO OTHER PASSING CABS HEARD THE CRY AND MADE FOR THE PLACE BUT THE GIRL HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO CALL TILL SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER FRIENDS THE FIRST CHANCE
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
AND FELT THEIR MINDS ATTUNED MOST SOLEMNLY A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD THE BELL HAS A TONE THAT IS WONDROUS SWEET LET US STROLL THITHER AND EXAMINE THE MATTER NEARER
APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
THEN HE SAT ON HIS CROUP AND DID HIS BACK AND SIDES
MOST OF WHICH LIVED ON FRUIT OR ON INSECTS THEY CAUGHT THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW AND THE MIGRATORY SORT FEWER STILL WELL WE'RE ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE REMARKED TOM AS AGAIN THEY WERE IN THE CANOES BEING PADDLED UP THE RIVER
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
FROM CHILDREN THEY BECOME ALL AT ONCE GROWN UP PERSONS IT WAS AS IF THEIR INFANT SOULS WERE NOW TO FLY ALL AT ONCE INTO PERSONS WITH MORE UNDERSTANDING THE SUN WAS SHINING GLORIOUSLY THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
I CERTAINLY AM IF THERE'S A FIGHT
I'M AFRAID HE WAS RATHER A FALSE FRIEND WAS THE PROFESSOR'S ANSWER
AND DRAGGING HER BROOM AFTER HER AND FROM THAT BY DEGREES HE RECALLED THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE GOT DOWN FROM NORTH WIND'S BACK IN A LONDON STREET BUT HE COULD NOT QUITE SATISFY HIMSELF WHETHER THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS NOT A DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMED WHEN HE WAS A VERY LITTLE BOY
WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
AND THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY GOT ANY FARTHER WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIM NICELY HE HAD ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER SOMETIMES A SMART ONE READY AND THAT HELPED MUCH TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HIM
FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON
IT WON'T DO TO HAVE A HORSE'S BELLY CLEAN AND HIS BACK DIRTY YOU KNOW GIVE ME A LEG SAID DIAMOND AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON THE OLD HORSE'S BACK WITH THE COMB AND BRUSH HE SAT ON HIS WITHERS AND REACHING FORWARD AS HE ATE HIS HAY
BLESS THE CHILD HE FORGETS NOTHING SAID HIS MOTHER REALLY DIAMOND A BODY WOULD NEED TO MIND WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU WHY SAID DIAMOND I ONLY THINK ABOUT IT
IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
WHY JOSEPH CAN IT BE YOU YES MA'AM YES MISS ANSWERED HE AGAIN TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH ALL THE RESPECT HE COULD POSSIBLY PUT INTO THE ACTION IT'S A LUCKY DAY WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE UPON IT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SAID MISSUS COLEMAN
WE MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT NED WE WERE TO START BEFORE OLD SOL GOT IN HIS HEAVY WORK BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ONE CALL US REMARKED NED NOR I WONDER IF WE'RE THE ONLY LAZY BIRDS
BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON
AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER
NOBODY KNOWS THE SENSE IN THAT HEAD OF HIS THE TWO LADIES WENT NEAR TO PAT THE HORSE AND THEN THEY NOTICED DIAMOND ON THE BOX WHY YOU'VE GOT BOTH DIAMONDS WITH YOU SAID MISS COLEMAN HOW DO YOU DO DIAMOND DIAMOND LIFTED HIS CAP AND ANSWERED POLITELY
FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS
YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN USED TO SUCH GRAND THINGS AND FOR THEM TO COME DOWN TO A LITTLE POKY HOUSE LIKE THAT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW SAID DIAMOND THOUGHTFULLY WHETHER MISSUS COLEMAN HAD BELLS ON HER TOES
IN WHICH WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED HE THOUGHT THE BELL SOUNDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THESE STILL LAKES BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE
SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING THE DARK DARK NIGHT YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
WHEN THEY FOUND THE WAY BLOCKED UP AND UPON INQUIRY WERE INFORMED THAT A STACK OF CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN IN THE NIGHT
COME BACK AGAIN CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SKIN I HOPE NOT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BATS AND MOSQUITOES HE ADDED AS HE SLAPPED AT HIS FACE AND NECK INDEED THE PARTY OF WHITES WERE SET UPON BY THE NIGHT INSECTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
BUT PRESENTLY HIS FATHER CAME BACK AND MISSING DIAMOND LOOKED ABOUT
PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS BEING IN A FRAY I COULDN'T LET THEM BEHAVE SO TO A POOR GIRL COULD I FATHER HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT DIAMOND SAID HIS FATHER QUITE PLEASED FOR DIAMOND'S FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN
SAID HIS MOTHER SHE HAD RINGS ON HER FINGERS ANYHOW RETURNED DIAMOND OF COURSE SHE HAD AS ANY LADY WOULD WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT WHEN WE WERE DOWN AT SANDWICH SAID DIAMOND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO PART WITH YOUR MOTHER'S RING NOW WE WERE POOR
PROFESSOR BUMPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE MAN'S FAMILY DID NOT WANT AND THIS SEEMED TO GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY TO A BROTHER WHO WAS WITH THE PARTY ASIDE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN A DRENCHING STORM AND ONE OR TWO MINOR ACCIDENTS
FROM WITHOUT THE TENT CAME THE INDIAN CRIES OF OSHTOO OSHTOO MINGLED WITH THEM WERE CALLS OF JACINTO PARTLY IN SPANISH PARTLY IN THE INDIAN TONGUE AND PARTLY IN ENGLISH IT IS A RAID BY VAMPIRE BATS WAS ALL TOM AND NED COULD DISTINGUISH
THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
FOR A TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THE BATS WOULD FAIRLY OVERWHELM THE CAMP SO MANY OF THEM WERE THERE BUT THE INCREASING LIGHTS AND THE ATTACKS MADE BY THE INDIANS AND THE WHITE TRAVELERS TURNED THE TIDE OF BATTLE AND WITH SILENT FLAPPINGS OF THEIR SOFT VELVETY WINGS
AND THEN HE CALLED TO THE PADDLERS TO INCREASE THEIR STROKES THE JOURNEY UP THE RIVER WAS NOT VERY EVENTFUL MANY ALLIGATORS WERE SEEN AND TOM AND NED SHOT SEVERAL WITH THE ELECTRIC RIFLE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS A CRY FROM ONE OF THE REAR BOATS
WHY IS THAT WHY PERSISTED DIAMOND
FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS
BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
OH WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH WORSE THAN THIS LAUGHED TOM IT'S ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WE'VE ONLY GOT STARTED
WE SHALL HAVE TO LIGHT FIRES TO KEEP THEM AWAY IF WE CAN SUCCEED EVERY ONE GRAB UP A CLUB AND STRIKE HARD COME ON CRIED TOM GETTING ON SOME CLOTHES BY THE LIGHT OF HIS GLEAMING ELECTRIC LIGHT WHICH HE HAD SET ON HIS COT YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE ARE YOU ASKED NED
SO THEY COULD BE CARRIED IN THE UPPER COAT POCKET SHOWING A GLEAM OF LIGHT AND LEAVING THE HANDS FREE FOR USE OUT OF THE TENTS RUSHED THE YOUNG MEN TO FIND PROFESSOR BUMPER AND MISTER DAMON BEFORE THEM THE TWO MEN HAD CLUBS AND WERE STRIKING ABOUT IN THE HALF DARKNESS
AS HE AND TOM AROSE IN THE GRAY DAWN OF THE MORNING WHEN JACINTO ANNOUNCED THE BREAKFAST WHICH THE INDIAN COOK HAD PREPARED THAT WAS SOME NIGHT IF THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE WILDS OF HONDURAS GIVE ME THE TAMENESS OF SHOPTON
HE RUSHED IN AND SENT THE ASSAILANTS FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE GIRL THANKED DIAMOND AND BEGAN SWEEPING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED WHILE HIS FATHER LED HIM AWAY WITH THE HELP OF OLD TOM THE WATERMAN HE WAS SOON WASHED INTO DECENCY
SO HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND PROUD AND PERHAPS SAID TO HIMSELF SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M A STUPID OLD HORSE WHO CAN'T BRUSH HIS OWN COAT BUT THERE'S MY YOUNG GODSON ON MY BACK CLEANING ME LIKE AN ANGEL I WON'T VOUCH FOR WHAT THE OLD HORSE WAS THINKING
KNOCKING IT INTO THE CORNER OF THE TENT WITH A THUD THAT TOLD IT MUST BE COMPLETELY STUNNED IF NOT KILLED
HE GOT HOLD OF THE BROOM AT HER END AND PULLED ALONG WITH HER BUT THE BOYS PROCEEDED TO ROUGHER MEASURES
AND SHE CAN'T BEAR THE MOTION OF THE OMNIBUSES INDEED WE MEANT TO WALK A BIT FIRST BEFORE WE TOOK A CAB BUT JUST AT THE CORNER FOR AS HOT AS THE SUN WAS A COLD WIND CAME DOWN THE STREET AND I SAW THAT MISS COLEMAN MUST NOT FACE IT
FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
ONE OF THEM LIFTED HIM DOWN AND FROM THAT TIME HE WAS A GREATER FAVOURITE THAN BEFORE AND IF EVER THERE WAS A BOY WHO HAD A CHANCE OF BEING A PRODIGY AT CAB DRIVING DIAMOND WAS THAT BOY FOR THE STRIFE CAME TO BE WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM OUT WITH HIM ON THE BOX
THE BATS FLEW BACK TO THE JUNGLE WHENCE THEY HAD EMERGED WE ARE SAFE FOR THE PRESENT EXCLAIMED JACINTO WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
I SEE OBSERVED TOM CALMLY HAND ME THE RIFLE NED TOM TOOK QUICK AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIVE ELECTRIC BULLET WENT TRUE TO ITS MARK AND THE GREAT ANIMAL TURNED OVER IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
ALL THE TIME THE OLD HORSE WENT ON EATING HIS HAY AND BUT WITH AN OCCASIONAL WHISK OF HIS TAIL WHEN DIAMOND TICKLED OR SCRATCHED HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE PROCEEDING BUT THAT WAS ALL A PRETENCE FOR HE KNEW VERY WELL WHO IT WAS THAT WAS PERCHED ON HIS BACK AND RUBBING AWAY AT HIM WITH THE COMB AND THE BRUSH
AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
I RATHER THINK THEY'VE GONE BACK WAS THE PROFESSOR'S DRY COMMENT GONE BACK YES THE INDIANS SEEM TO HAVE DESERTED US AT THE ENDING OF THIS STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY BLESS MY TIME TABLE CRIED MISTER DAMON YOU DON'T SAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
CAN KILL A HORSE OR AN OX IN A SHORT TIME BY SUCKING ITS BLOOD SO WHEN THE VILLAGERS FIND THEY ARE VISITED BY A COLONY OF THESE VAMPIRES THEY GET OUT TAKING THEIR LIVE STOCK WITH THEM AND STAY IN CAVES OR IN DENSELY WOODED PLACES UNTIL THE BATS FLY ON
BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
AND WOOD AND SEA
AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
THAT'S THE SHADOW LOOK OUT AND HE HELD UP HIS HANDS INSTINCTIVELY TO SHIELD HIS FACE SHADOW YELLED TOM UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDING TO THE DIN THAT SEEMED TO PERVADE EVERY PART OF THE CAMP THAT ISN'T A SHADOW IT'S SUBSTANCE IT'S A MONSTER BAT
AND THEN MISSUS COLEMAN TOOK OUT HER PURSE SAYING AND WHAT'S YOUR FARE JOSEPH NO THANK YOU MA'AM SAID JOSEPH IT WAS YOUR OWN OLD HORSE AS TOOK YOU AND ME YOU PAID LONG AGO HE JUMPED ON HIS BOX BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD
HE CAUGHT UP HIS CAMERA TRIPOD WHICH WAS NEAR HIS COT AND MADE A SWING WITH IT AT THE CREATURE THAT HAD FLOWN INTO THE TENT THROUGH AN OPENING IT HAD MADE FOR ITSELF LOOK OUT YELLED NED IF IT'S A VAMPIRE IT'LL IT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO ME SHOUTED TOM AS HE STRUCK THE CREATURE
AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND BECAME A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH ALL THE MEN ABOUT THE MEWS SOME MAY THINK IT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT UP IN BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THERE HE WAS
BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER AND WHEN THE OTHERS REACHED THE WILLOW TREE WHERE THE CONFECTIONER WAS THEY SAID NOW WE ARE THERE
SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
BUT MAYHAP THEY MAY GET MORE LAW THAN THEY LIKE SOME DAY THEMSELVES
THE WATERS SEETHED AND BUBBLED AS THE ALLIGATORS FOUGHT UNDER IT FOR POSSESSION OF THE PADDLER TOM FIRED BULLET AFTER BULLET FROM HIS WONDERFUL RIFLE INTO THE SPOT BUT THOUGH HE KILLED SOME OF THE ALLIGATORS THIS DID NOT SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE HIS BODY WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN
HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
WHERE THE HOUSES WERE FARTHER APART WITH GARDENS OR LITTLE FIELDS BETWEEN THEM COULD SEE THE EVENING SKY STILL BETTER AND HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BELL MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST PEOPLE LOOKED THITHERWARD
HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
NOTHING ELSE OF MOMENT MARKED THE REMAINDER OF THE RIVER JOURNEY AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY THE CANOES PULLED TO SHORE AND A NIGHT CAMP WAS MADE BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES WE ARE TO USE IN TRAVELING TO MORROW ASKED THE PROFESSOR OF JACINTO IN THE NEXT VILLAGE
THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
I DO NOT THINK THIS LOT WILL COME BACK WE HAVE KILLED TOO MANY OF THEM
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
AND ONCE HE SENT THE COMB FLYING OUT OF THE STABLE DOOR TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF THE MEN BUT JACK FETCHED IT AGAIN AND DIAMOND BEGAN ONCE MORE AND DID NOT LEAVE OFF UNTIL HE HAD DONE THE WHOLE BUSINESS FAIRLY WELL IF NOT IN A FIRST RATE EXPERIENCED FASHION
A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
AND GIVE ANOTHER TO THE OLD WATERMAN HE LEFT DIAMOND ON THE BOX A SUDDEN NOISE GOT UP AND DIAMOND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THE INDIANS SEEMED GLAD TO LEAVE THE PLACE OF THE BATS AS THEY CALLED THE CAMP SITE JACINTO EXPLAINED THAT THE INDIANS BELIEVED A VAMPIRE COULD KILL THEM WHILE THEY SLEPT AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS
THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT
THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CURBSTONE WHO SHOULD IT BE WAITING FOR THE CAB BUT MISSUS AND MISS COLEMAN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE CABMAN HOWEVER
HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT MAY BE IN THEM GREAT HEATHEN TEMPLES IDOLS PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT NONE OF THE PROFESSOR'S COMPANIONS SPOKE
AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE
THOUGH TO BE SURE SAID DIAMOND'S FATHER WITH WHAT TRUTH I CANNOT SAY BUT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID SOME LADIES IS VERY HARD AND KEEPS YOU TO THE BARE SIXPENCE A MILE WHEN EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP A FAMILY AND A CAB UPON TO BE SURE IT'S THE LAW
AND SPOILT ONES TOO MISSUS COLEMAN IS NONE SO POOR AS ALL THAT YET NO THANK HEAVEN SHE'S NOT COME TO THAT IS IT A GREAT DISGRACE TO BE POOR ASKED DIAMOND BECAUSE OF THE TONE IN WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN
FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
SHE TOLD THE CABMAN AND AWAY THEY DROVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE DIAMOND'S FATHER GOT DOWN AND RANG THE BELL
WHERE THE DEER WERE PLAYING IN THE GRASS GREW MAGNIFICENT OAKS AND BEECHES AND IF THE BARK OF ONE OF THE TREES WAS CRACKED THERE GRASS AND LONG CREEPING PLANTS GREW IN THE CREVICES AND THERE WERE LARGE CALM LAKES THERE TOO
AND IN THE TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THEY WERE SAID WHICH DIAMOND FELT TO BE UGLY SO THEY DID NOT EVEN STICK TO HIM NOT TO SAY GET INSIDE HIM HE NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM
THOUGH SEARCH WAS MADE FOR IT THE ACCIDENT CAST A LITTLE DAMPER OVER THE PARTY
ONE DAY JACK GAVE HIM A CURRY COMB AND A BRUSH TO TRY HIS HAND UPON OLD DIAMOND'S COAT HE USED THEM SO DEFTLY SO GENTLY AND YET SO THOROUGHLY AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH THAT THE MAN COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIM YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND GROW HE SAID
ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED TOM SPRINGING FROM HIS COT AND HASTENING TO THE SIDE OF HIS CHUM IN THE TENT
THEY DREW UP IN THE ROW UPON THE STAND BETWEEN COCKSPUR STREET AND PALL MALL THEY WAITED A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT TO BE CARRIED ANYWHERE BY AND BY LADIES WOULD BE GOING HOME FROM THE ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF A JOB
AND HAD AS PLEASANT DREAMS AS EVER A QUEEN ON HER WEDDING DAY THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND THUS PASSED AWAY A DAY GERDA KNEW EVERY FLOWER AND NUMEROUS AS THEY WERE IT
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES LOOKED LIKE BOILED SPINACH AND THE BEST PERSONS WERE TURNED INTO FRIGHTS OR APPEARED TO STAND ON THEIR HEADS THEIR FACES WERE SO DISTORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE RECOGNISED AND IF ANYONE HAD A MOLE
THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER
BE GOOD ENOUGH ALICE PANTED OUT AFTER RUNNING A LITTLE FURTHER TO STOP A MINUTE JUST TO GET ONE'S BREATH AGAIN I'M GOOD ENOUGH THE KING SAID
ARE YOU STILL COLD ASKED SHE AND THEN SHE KISSED HIS FOREHEAD AH IT WAS COLDER THAN ICE IT PENETRATED TO HIS VERY HEART WHICH WAS ALREADY ALMOST A FROZEN LUMP
AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
SHE ASKED AS WELL AS SHE COULD
IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY LITTLE PLAYFELLOW
OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS AND BENEATH THEM
FOR THE STREAM DRIFTED THE BOAT QUITE NEAR THE LAND GERDA CALLED STILL LOUDER AND AN OLD WOMAN THEN CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE LEANING UPON A CROOKED STICK SHE HAD A LARGE BROAD BRIMMED HAT ON
AND OUT OF DOORS THERE WAS QUITE A SNOW STORM IT IS THE WHITE BEES THAT ARE SWARMING SAID KAY'S OLD GRANDMOTHER
STRETCHED OUT HER CROOKED STICK TOWARDS THE ROSE BUSHES WHICH BEAUTIFULLY AS THEY WERE BLOWING ALL SANK INTO THE EARTH AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE THEY HAD STOOD THE OLD WOMAN FEARED THAT IF GERDA SHOULD SEE THE ROSES SHE WOULD THEN THINK OF HER OWN
THE SNOW FLAKES GREW LARGER AND LARGER TILL AT LAST THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE GREAT WHITE FOWLS SUDDENLY THEY FLEW ON ONE SIDE THE LARGE SLEDGE STOPPED AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE ROSE UP IT WAS A LADY
TO COME AND GO ONE TO COME AND ONE TO GO
THIS HE SAID AT LAST
AND THEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PATTED HIS HEAD AND TOLD HIM OTHER STORIES IN THE EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY WAS AT HOME AND HALF UNDRESSED HE CLIMBED UP ON THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT OF THE LITTLE HOLE A FEW SNOW FLAKES WERE FALLING
THE LION SAID LYING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS CHIN ON THIS PAWS AND SIT DOWN BOTH OF YOU TO THE KING AND THE UNICORN
THE SNOW QUEEN FIRST STORY WHICH TREATS OF A MIRROR AND OF THE SPLINTERS NOW THEN LET US BEGIN
AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
AND AT THAT DISTANCE TOO WHY IT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO SEE REAL PEOPLE BY THIS LIGHT ALL THIS WAS LOST ON ALICE WHO WAS STILL LOOKING INTENTLY ALONG THE ROAD SHADING HER EYES WITH ONE HAND
AND RUN AWAY FROM HER SHE NOW LED GERDA INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN OH WHAT ODOUR AND WHAT LOVELINESS WAS THERE EVERY FLOWER THAT ONE COULD THINK OF AND OF EVERY SEASON STOOD THERE IN FULLEST BLOOM
THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT FROM HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE OTHERS VANISH IN THE EARTH BUT SO IT IS WHEN ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT COLLECTED WHAT
AND THIS TIME A TEAR OR TWO TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK BUT NOT A WORD WOULD HE SAY SPEAK CAN'T YOU HAIGHA CRIED IMPATIENTLY
LED HER INTO THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THE WINDOWS WERE VERY HIGH UP THE GLASS WAS RED BLUE AND GREEN AND THE SUNLIGHT SHONE THROUGH QUITE WONDROUSLY IN ALL SORTS OF COLORS
AND SHE RAN ABOUT AMONGST THE FLOWERBEDS AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM THE SNOW DRIFTED AND THE SLEDGE FLEW ON AND SOMETIMES IT GAVE A JERK AS THOUGH THEY WERE DRIVING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES HE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HE TRIED TO REPEAT THE LORD'S PRAYER BUT ALL HE COULD DO HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REMEMBER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST AND THEN THE SPRING CAME THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN
AND I HAVEN'T SENT THE TWO MESSENGERS EITHER
SHE CAME FLYING OUT OF THE WOOD OVER YONDER HOW FAST THOSE QUEENS CAN RUN
AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE
I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
WHICH THE POOR KING WAS NEARLY SHAKING OFF HIS HEAD HE TREMBLED SO MUCH
PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER
SHE WAS TALL AND OF SLENDER FIGURE
AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER
WHERE THE OTHERS ARE PLAYING AND OFF HE WAS IN A MOMENT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE SOME OF THE BOLDEST OF THE BOYS USED TO TIE THEIR SLEDGES TO THE CARTS AS THEY PASSED BY AND SO THEY WERE PULLED ALONG AND GOT A GOOD RIDE
IF THEY DID NOT MELT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT KAY CAME ONE DAY WITH LARGE GLOVES ON AND HIS LITTLE SLEDGE AT HIS BACK AND BAWLED RIGHT INTO GERDA'S EARS I HAVE PERMISSION TO GO OUT INTO THE SQUARE
IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM
THAT SUMMER THE ROSES FLOWERED IN UNWONTED BEAUTY THE LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN
ASKED THE LITTLE BOY FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE
THE LION LOOKED AT ALICE WEARILY ARE YOU ANIMAL
HIS NAME IS HAIGHA AND HE LIVES HE LIVES ON THE HILL THE KING REMARKED SIMPLY WITHOUT THE LEAST IDEA THAT HE WAS JOINING IN THE GAME WHILE ALICE WAS STILL HESITATING FOR THE NAME OF A TOWN BEGINNING WITH H
ON THE TABLE STOOD THE MOST EXQUISITE CHERRIES AND GERDA ATE AS MANY AS SHE CHOSE FOR SHE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO WHILE SHE WAS EATING THE OLD WOMAN COMBED HER HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DO SO THE BOAT WAS MORE THAN A YARD FROM THE LAND AND WAS GLIDING QUICKLY ONWARD LITTLE GERDA WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT NO ONE HEARD HER EXCEPT THE SPARROWS AND THEY COULD NOT CARRY HER TO LAND BUT THEY FLEW ALONG THE BANK
SHE ROSE AND LOOKED FOR MANY HOURS AT THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN BANKS PRESENTLY SHE SAILED BY A LARGE CHERRY ORCHARD
WHY I BEAT YOU ALL ROUND THE TOWN YOU CHICKEN THE LION REPLIED ANGRILY HALF GETTING UP AS HE SPOKE HERE THE KING INTERRUPTED TO PREVENT THE QUARREL GOING ON
SAID ALICE SEVERAL THOUSAND I SHOULD THINK FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THE KING SAID REFERRING TO HIS BOOK
EVERY TIME HE WAS GOING TO UNTIE HIS SLEDGE THE PERSON NODDED TO HIM AND THEN KAY SAT QUIET AND SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE TOWN THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL SO THICKLY
AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
AND POOR KAY HAD GOT ANOTHER PIECE RIGHT IN HIS HEART
IT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAST SAID SHE BUT IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD COME UNDER MY BEARSKIN AND SHE PUT HIM IN THE SLEDGE BESIDE HER WRAPPED THE FUR ROUND HIM AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE SINKING IN A SNOW WREATH
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
WHILE BY DAY HE SLEPT AT THE FEET OF THE SNOW QUEEN THIRD STORY OF THE FLOWER GARDEN AT THE OLD WOMAN'S WHO UNDERSTOOD WITCHCRAFT
HIS NAME WAS KAY HERS WAS GERDA IN SUMMER WITH ONE JUMP THEY COULD GET TO EACH OTHER BUT IN WINTER THEY WERE OBLIGED FIRST TO GO DOWN THE LONG STAIRS AND THEN UP THE LONG STAIRS AGAIN
PEEPING INTO THE BAG HAY THEN THE KING MURMURED IN A FAINT WHISPER ALICE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT REVIVED HIM A GOOD DEAL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EATING HAY WHEN YOU'RE FAINT
HE CAN'T DO THAT
OH THOSE WERE VERY LONG AND DISMAL WINTER EVENINGS AT LAST SPRING CAME WITH ITS WARM SUNSHINE KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID LITTLE GERDA THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THE SUNSHINE
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN HIM THROUGH WITH YOUR HORN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T HURT HIM THE UNICORN SAID CARELESSLY AND HE WAS GOING ON WHEN HIS EYE HAPPENED TO FALL UPON ALICE HE TURNED ROUND RATHER INSTANTLY
SAID ALICE IT ISN'T RESPECTABLE TO BEG SAID THE KING I ONLY MEANT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE
THE KING REMARKED IN A FRETFUL TONE
AND THAT WAS A SAD AFFAIR WHEN PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR GLASSES TO SEE WELL AND RIGHTLY THEN THE WICKED SPRITE LAUGHED TILL HE ALMOST CHOKED FOR ALL THIS TICKLED HIS FANCY THE FINE SPLINTERS STILL FLEW ABOUT IN THE AIR
NOW YOU SHALL SEE HOW WELL WE AGREE TOGETHER AND WHILE SHE COMBED LITTLE GERDA'S HAIR THE CHILD FORGOT HER FOSTER BROTHER KAY MORE AND MORE FOR THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD MAGIC BUT SHE WAS NO EVIL BEING
MY SLEDGE DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND SPRANG ACROSS THE LITTLE BROOK IN HER TERROR
AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
WHERE COULD HE BE NOBODY KNEW NOBODY COULD GIVE ANY INTELLIGENCE ALL THE BOYS KNEW WAS THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM TIE HIS SLEDGE TO ANOTHER LARGE AND SPLENDID ONE WHICH DROVE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF THE TOWN
AND HAVE A JOKE THERE THE HIGHER THEY FLEW WITH THE MIRROR THE MORE TERRIBLY IT GRINNED THEY COULD HARDLY HOLD IT FAST HIGHER AND HIGHER STILL THEY FLEW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE STARS WHEN SUDDENLY
YET SHE LIVED HER EYES GAZED FIXEDLY LIKE TWO STARS BUT THERE WAS NEITHER QUIET NOR REPOSE IN THEM SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND THE LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED
DOUBLE E AT THIS MOMENT THE UNICORN SAUNTERED BY THEM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS I HAD THE BEST OF IT THIS TIME HE SAID TO THE KING JUST GLANCING AT HIM AS HE PASSED
SAID SHE ONE MORNING KAY HAS NEVER SEEN THEM AND THEN I'LL GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND ASK THERE IT WAS QUITE EARLY SHE KISSED HER OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP PUT ON HER RED SHOES AND WENT ALONE TO THE RIVER
THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT
KAY IS DEAD AND GONE
NOW YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE KISSES SAID SHE OR ELSE I SHOULD KISS YOU TO DEATH KAY LOOKED AT HER SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL A MORE CLEVER OR A MORE LOVELY COUNTENANCE HE COULD NOT FANCY TO HIMSELF
IT WAS SO CAPITAL JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THEIR AMUSEMENT A LARGE SLEDGE PASSED BY
THIS YOUNG LADY LOVES YOU WITH AN H THE KING SAID INTRODUCING ALICE IN THE HOPE OF TURNING OFF THE MESSENGER'S ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BUT IT WAS NO USE
AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
WITH ANGRY LOOKS AT BEING INTERRUPTED IN THEIR FEAST BEFORE SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES AND PUT HER HANDS OVER HER EARS VAINLY TRYING TO SHUT OUT THE DREADFUL UPROAR IF THAT DOESN'T DRUM THEM OUT OF TOWN SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
SHE'S KEPT NONE FOR HERSELF ANYHOW SAID THE LION
THESE MANAGED RATHER BETTER THAN THE FOOT SOLDIERS BUT EVEN THEY STUMBLED NOW AND THEN AND IT SEEMED TO BE A REGULAR RULE THAT
AND SPREADING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TOWARDS HER IN AN ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDE
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
WITH A ROUGH WHITE FUR CAP ON HIS HEAD
AND SHE NO LONGER APPEARED OF ICE AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND BECKONED TO HIM IN HIS EYES SHE WAS PERFECT HE DID NOT FEAR HER AT ALL AND TOLD HER THAT HE COULD CALCULATE IN HIS HEAD AND WITH FRACTIONS EVEN
AND THEN PEOPLE SAW EVERYTHING PERVERTED OR ONLY HAD AN EYE FOR THAT WHICH WAS EVIL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE VERY SMALLEST BIT HAD THE SAME POWER WHICH THE WHOLE MIRROR HAD POSSESSED SOME PERSONS EVEN GOT A SPLINTER IN THEIR HEART
BUT SHE SOON MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH THE UNICORN BY HIS HORN THEY PLACED THEMSELVES CLOSE TO WHERE HATTA THE OTHER MESSENGER WAS STANDING WATCHING THE FIGHT WITH A CUP OF TEA IN ONE HAND AND A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN THE OTHER
YOU MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE MAGNIFIED AND SPREAD OVER BOTH NOSE AND MOUTH
BUT HE NO DOUBT WOULD COME AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO BE CAST DOWN BUT TASTE HER CHERRIES AND LOOK AT HER FLOWERS WHICH WERE FINER THAN ANY IN A PICTURE BOOK EACH OF WHICH COULD TELL A WHOLE STORY SHE THEN TOOK GERDA BY THE HAND
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO DIE BUT A MOMENT MORE
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET
THOUGHT OF HER OWN DEAR ROSES AT HOME AND WITH THEM OF LITTLE KAY OH HOW LONG I HAVE STAYED SAID THE LITTLE GIRL I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR KAY DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS SHE ASKED OF THE ROSES DO YOU THINK HE IS DEAD AND GONE
THAT THE LITTLE BOY COULD NOT SEE AN ARM'S LENGTH BEFORE HIM BUT STILL ON HE WENT WHEN SUDDENLY HE LET GO THE STRING HE HELD IN HIS HAND IN ORDER TO GET LOOSE FROM THE SLEDGE
THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS
AND NOW IT WORKED MUCH MORE EVIL THAN BEFORE FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES WERE HARDLY SO LARGE AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND THEY FLEW ABOUT IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO PEOPLE'S EYES THERE THEY STAYED
HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HATTA'S NECK HATTA LOOKED ROUND AND NODDED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAD AND BUTTER WERE YOU HAPPY IN PRISON DEAR CHILD SAID HAIGHA HATTA LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
THE UNICORN WENT ON TURNING FROM HER TO THE KING NONE OF YOUR BROWN BREAD FOR ME CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE KING MUTTERED AND BECKONED TO HAIGHA OPEN THE BAG HE WHISPERED QUICK NOT THAT ONE
CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BOAT WITH HER CROOKED STICK DREW IT TO THE BANK AND LIFTED LITTLE GERDA OUT AND GERDA WAS SO GLAD TO BE ON DRY LAND AGAIN
THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE WINKED HIS EYES NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
THE BOXES WERE VERY HIGH AND THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT THEY MUST NOT CREEP OVER THEM SO THEY OFTEN OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO EACH OTHER AND TO SIT ON THEIR LITTLE STOOLS AMONG THE ROSES WHERE THEY COULD PLAY DELIGHTFULLY
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
BUT THEY FELL CLOSE TO THE BANK AND THE LITTLE WAVES BORE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO LAND IT WAS AS IF THE STREAM WOULD NOT TAKE WHAT WAS DEAREST TO HER FOR IN REALITY IT HAD NOT GOT LITTLE KAY
I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
THE WOLVES HOWLED THE SNOW CRACKLED ABOVE THEM FLEW LARGE SCREAMING CROWS BUT HIGHER UP APPEARED THE MOON QUITE LARGE AND BRIGHT
THEN SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS SHE POSSESSED
SAID HE BUT IT WAS NOT IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF GLASS FROM THE MAGIC MIRROR
THE BOAT DRIFTED WITH THE STREAM LITTLE GERDA SAT QUITE STILL WITHOUT SHOES FOR THEY WERE SWIMMING BEHIND THE BOAT BUT SHE COULD NOT REACH THEM BECAUSE THE BOAT WENT MUCH FASTER THAN THEY DID THE BANKS ON BOTH SIDES WERE BEAUTIFUL LOVELY FLOWERS VENERABLE TREES
THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT
SAID THE ROSES WE HAVE BEEN IN THE EARTH WHERE ALL THE DEAD ARE BUT KAY WAS NOT THERE MANY THANKS SAID LITTLE GERDA AND SHE WENT TO THE OTHER FLOWERS LOOKED INTO THEIR CUPS AND ASKED
HE COPIED ALL HER WAYS AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM HE WAS SOON ABLE TO IMITATE THE GAIT AND MANNER OF EVERYONE IN THE STREET EVERYTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR AND DISPLEASING IN THEM THAT KAY KNEW HOW TO IMITATE AND AT SUCH TIMES
THEN A GRIN WAS SEEN IN THE MIRROR AND THE SPRITE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS CLEVER DISCOVERY ALL THE LITTLE SPRITES WHO WENT TO HIS SCHOOL FOR HE KEPT A SPRITE SCHOOL TOLD EACH OTHER THAT A MIRACLE HAD HAPPENED
SHE ONLY PRACTISED WITCHCRAFT A LITTLE FOR HER OWN PRIVATE AMUSEMENT AND NOW SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO KEEP LITTLE GERDA SHE THEREFORE WENT OUT
I SEE SOMEBODY NOW SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST
AND CAUGHT THE SNOW AS IT FELL LOOK THROUGH THIS GLASS GERDA SAID HE AND EVERY FLAKE SEEMED LARGER AND APPEARED LIKE A MAGNIFICENT FLOWER OR BEAUTIFUL STAR IT WAS SPLENDID TO LOOK AT LOOK HOW CLEVER
AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE
THAT THERE IS NO ROOF LEFT FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN AND WHERE ON THIS ACCOUNT MOST PERSONS ARE OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS IN POTS THERE LIVED TWO LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD A GARDEN SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A FLOWER POT
STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS
HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
WHAT A FIGHT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR THE CROWN NOW THE UNICORN SAID
AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY
THAT THEY SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE FOREST ALICE GOT BEHIND A TREE FOR FEAR OF BEING RUN OVER AND WATCHED THEM GO BY SHE THOUGHT THAT IN ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SOLDIERS SO UNCERTAIN ON THEIR FEET
THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
AND SLOPES WITH SHEEP AND COWS BUT NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL CARRY ME TO LITTLE KAY
THE BOY IS CERTAINLY VERY CLEVER
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
BUT BEFORE ALICE COULD ANSWER HIM THE DRUMS BEGAN WHERE THE NOISE CAME FROM SHE COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE AIR SEEMED FULL OF IT AND IT RANG THROUGH AND THROUGH HER HEAD TILL SHE FELT QUITE DEAFENED
STILL SEEMED TO GERDA THAT ONE WAS WANTING THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE HAT OF THE OLD WOMAN PAINTED WITH FLOWERS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL SEEMED TO HER TO BE A ROSE
THE LION BEAT THE UNICORN ALL ROUND THE TOWN SOME GAVE THEM WHITE BREAD SOME GAVE THEM BROWN SOME GAVE THEM PLUM CAKE AND DRUMMED THEM OUT OF TOWN DOES THE ONE THAT WINS GET THE CROWN
I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT WHICH ALICE DID NOT VENTURE TO DENY WHO DID YOU PASS ON THE ROAD THE KING WENT ON HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MESSENGER FOR SOME MORE HAY
HOWEVER NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BREATH YOU MAY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE TOWN I'LL WHISPER IT SAID THE MESSENGER PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUMPET AND STOOPING
SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW BUT TO BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR
MANY A WINTER'S NIGHT SHE FLIES THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN AND PEEPS IN AT THE WINDOWS
IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
HAVE COFFEE AT DOVER DERYCK JANE GAVE ONE HARD TEARLESS SOB OF THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN SO LONELY THEN SHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW HERE SOMEBODY FETCH ME A CUP OF COFFEE WILL YOU
PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
AND NO ONE MADE ANY FUSS WHATEVER ABOUT THE WASTE OR EXTERMINATION OF WILD LIFE THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF OX TEAMS AND BROAD AXES TO DAY WE ARE LIVING IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD
AND SO THOROUGHLY ACCEPTED AND PROMULGATED THAT THEIR BINDING FORCE CAN NOT BE IGNORED AMONG OTHER THINGS IT IS TIME FOR A LIST OF SPECIES TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH NO MAN CLAIMING TO BE EITHER A GENTLEMAN OR A SPORTSMAN

O FRIEND I WILL OF YOU
OFTEN IN VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAWS AND ALWAYS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PROTECTION OF GAME FOR LEGITIMATE SPORT THE LEWIS AND CLARK CLUB CONDEMNS THE PURCHASE OR THE SALE OF THE HEADS OR HORNS OF ANY GAME
TO MEET AN ANTIQUE BOOK IN JUST THE DRESS HIS CENTURY WORE A PRIVILEGE I THINK HIS VENERABLE HAND TO TAKE AND WARMING IN OUR OWN A PASSAGE BACK OR TWO TO MAKE TO TIMES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG

WHOSE FARTHEST OF DEGREE WAS THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DISTANT HEAVEN DWELL TIMIDLY WITH THEE
YOU UNSUSPECTING FEEL FOR ME ALMOST A LONELINESS
FOR YOU SERVED HEAVEN YOU KNOW OR SOUGHT TO I COULD NOT BECAUSE YOU SATURATED SIGHT AND I HAD NO MORE EYES FOR SORDID EXCELLENCE AS PARADISE AND WERE YOU LOST I WOULD BE
AND THE VALUE OF WILD GAME AS HUMAN FOOD SHOULD NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS PURSUIT NINE IF RIGHTLY CONSERVED WILD GAME CONSTITUTES A VALUABLE ASSET
WHILE THE OLD COUPLE JUST ASTIR FANCY THE SUNRISE LEFT THE DOOR AJAR
A PARTICULARLY FINE PHOTOGRAPH OF A LARGE WILD ANIMAL IN ITS HAUNTS IS ENTITLED TO MORE CREDIT THAN THE DEAD TROPHY OF A SIMILAR ANIMAL AN ANIMAL THAT HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED NEVER SHOULD BE KILLED UNLESS PREVIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THE CHASE
I COUNT IT AS RATHER STRANGE THAT AMERICAN AND ENGLISH SPORTSMEN
ELYSIUM IS AS FAR AS TO THE VERY NEAREST ROOM IF IN THAT ROOM A FRIEND AWAIT FELICITY OR DOOM WHAT FORTITUDE THE SOUL CONTAINS

BECAUSE YOUR FACE WOULD PUT OUT JESUS THAT NEW GRACE GLOW PLAIN AND FOREIGN ON MY HOMESICK EYE EXCEPT THAT YOU THAN HE SHONE CLOSER BY THEY'D JUDGE US HOW
THE SALE OF GAME IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PERPETUAL PRESERVATION OF A PROPER STOCK OF GAME
PURCHASE AND SALE OF TROPHIES AS THE PURCHASE OF HEADS AND HORNS ESTABLISHES A MARKET VALUE AND ENCOURAGES INDIANS AND OTHERS TO SHOOT FOR SALE
A MODUS VIVENDI WORTH WHILE PRIOR TO NINETEEN O EIGHT NO EFFORT SO FAR AS WE ARE AWARE EVER HAD BEEN MADE TO PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND UP TO DATE CODE OF ETHICS FOR SPORTSMEN WHO SHOOT
IT IS THEREFORE THE DUTY OF EVERY GOOD CITIZEN TO PROMOTE THE PROTECTION OF FORESTS AND WILD LIFE AND THE CREATION OF GAME PRESERVES

I HIDE MYSELF WITHIN MY FLOWER THAT WEARING ON YOUR BREAST YOU UNSUSPECTING WEAR ME TOO AND ANGELS KNOW THE REST I HIDE MYSELF WITHIN MY FLOWER
THE KILLING OF A FEMALE HOOFED ANIMAL SAVE FOR SPECIAL PRESERVATION IS TO BE REGARDED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE HIGHEST SPORTSMANSHIP AND IT SHOULD EVERYWHERE BE PROHIBITED BY STRINGENT LAWS FIFTEEN

WHAT INTERESTED SCHOLARS MOST WHAT COMPETITIONS RAN WHEN PLATO WAS A CERTAINTY AND SOPHOCLES A MAN
AND THERE WERE NO WILDERNESS GAME PRESERVES IN THOSE DAYS GENTLEMEN SHOT FEMALE HOOFED GAME TRAPPED BEARS IF THEY FELT LIKE IT
AND CHERUBIM AND SERAPHIM THE MOST FAMILIAR GUEST
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
AND GAVE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ROCK STANDING UP ALONE IN A SEA OF BILLOW AND SPRAY TO THE BROKEN BOAT STRANDED ON A DESOLATE COAST
WITH SUBDUED BROKEN REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY OF THE BED AND ROOM I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON AFAR IT OFFERED A PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
THAT RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
AND PERHAPS TO PINING AFTER HOME JOHN HAD NOT MUCH AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AN ANTIPATHY TO ME HE BULLIED AND PUNISHED ME NOT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE WEEK
SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
NOW I'LL TEACH YOU TO RUMMAGE MY BOOKSHELVES FOR THEY ARE MINE ALL THE HOUSE BELONGS TO ME OR WILL DO IN A FEW YEARS
SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
AND THEN MY COURAGE SANK MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
HE CONTRIVED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT A GRIMACE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE LAST BITE WHICH PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT FELIX WAS VASTLY ENCOURAGED
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
HE CALLED HIS MOTHER OLD GIRL TOO SOMETIMES REVILED HER FOR HER DARK SKIN SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BLUNTLY DISREGARDED HER WISHES NOT UNFREQUENTLY TORE AND SPOILED HER SILK ATTIRE
AND APPEARING BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS I RETURNED TO MY STOOL SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
HE'S GOT TO STOP PRAYING AGAINST ME ANYHOW SAID FELIX RESOLUTELY
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON EARTH I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS WHAT IS ALL THIS
AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
NOT SOON ENOUGH HOWEVER THE VOLUME WAS FLUNG IT HIT ME AND I FELL STRIKING MY HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR AND CUTTING IT THE CUT BLED THE PAIN WAS SHARP MY TERROR HAD PASSED ITS CLIMAX OTHER FEELINGS SUCCEEDED
ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM
BESSIE AND ABBOT ENTERED MISS EYRE ARE YOU ILL SAID BESSIE
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
THAT CERTAINLY WAS A CRIME AND WAS I FIT TO DIE OR WAS THE VAULT UNDER THE CHANCEL OF GATESHEAD CHURCH AN INVITING BOURNE IN SUCH VAULT I HAD BEEN TOLD DID MISTER REED LIE BURIED AND LED BY THIS THOUGHT TO RECALL HIS IDEA
THE WARDROBE THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE MADE HIM THIN THE WAY HE WORRIED OVER THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE DONE IT FOR MYSELF I CARED NOT A GROAT
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE INSULT WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED I WAS READING SHOW THE BOOK I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
I MAY BE MISTAKEN BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY GIRL WANTED THAT FIGHT STOPPED
SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED
MY HEAD GREW HOT A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSHING OF WINGS SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME I WAS OPPRESSED SUFFOCATED ENDURANCE BROKE DOWN I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE LOCK IN DESPERATE EFFORT
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
IT WAS ULTIMATELY ARRANGED THAT THE COMBAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIR WOOD BEHIND UNCLE ROGER'S GRANARY IT WAS A NICE REMOTE BOSKY PLACE WHERE NO PROWLING GROWN UP WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTRUDE
I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
AFTER THAT NO MORAL FORCE ON EARTH COULD HAVE PREVENTED FELIX FROM FIGHTING HE WOULD HAVE FACED AN ARMY WITH BANNERS YOU MIGHT SETTLE IT BY DRAWING LOTS SAID CECILY DESPERATELY DRAWING LOTS IS WICKEDER THAT FIGHTING SAID DAN
I REALIZED HOW DEEPLY HE FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND HOPED HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL FELIX PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FACE AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS MANNER
BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
UNCLE ALEC WALKED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GRANARY WITH CECILY BEHIND HIM HE WAS NOT ANGRY THERE WAS A QUIZZICAL LOOK IN HIS EYES BUT HE TOOK THE COMBATANTS BY THEIR SHIRT COLLARS AND DRAGGED THEM APART THIS STOPS RIGHT HERE BOYS
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
PERSISTED CECILY GOOD PRESBYTERIANS DON'T FIGHT OH DON'T THEY I HEARD YOUR UNCLE ROGER SAY THAT PRESBYTERIANS WERE THE BEST FOR FIGHTING IN THE WORLD OR THE WORST I FORGET WHICH HE SAID BUT IT MEANS THE SAME THING
AND I THOUGHT MISTER REED'S SPIRIT HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
FELIX MARCHED OVER TO UNCLE ROGER'S AND WE TRAILED AFTER SCENTING A SCENE WE FOUND PETER SHELLING BEANS IN THE GRANARY AND WHISTLING CHEERILY AS WITH A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENCE TOWARDS ALL MEN LOOK HERE PETER
OF THESE DEATH WHITE REALMS I FORMED AN IDEA OF MY OWN
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT PETER CRAIG
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
AS RUNNING AWAY OR IF THAT COULD NOT BE EFFECTED NEVER EATING OR DRINKING MORE AND LETTING MYSELF DIE WHAT A CONSTERNATION OF SOUL WAS MINE THAT DREARY AFTERNOON
THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
HE TOLD FELICITY AND FELICITY TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL CUTE OF HIM I THINK THAT IS A DREADFUL WAY TO TALK ABOUT PRAYING AND I TOLD HER SO
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
I DWELT ON IT WITH GATHERING DREAD I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN UNCLE
ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
CECILY WAS VERY PALE AND FELIX AND PETER WERE TAKING OFF THEIR COATS THERE WAS A PURE YELLOW SUNSET THAT EVENING
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
BESSIE ANSWERED NOT BUT ERE LONG ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE MISS THAT YOU ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO MISSUS REED SHE KEEPS YOU
AND FELT SORE WHENEVER I THOUGHT OF MY FAILURE BUT I HAD NO BURNING DESIRE TO EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT GRIMACING AND I DID NOT SYMPATHIZE OVER AND ABOVE WITH MY BROTHER WHEN HOWEVER HE TOOK TO PRAYING ABOUT IT
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY I TOTTERED AND ON REGAINING MY EQUILIBRIUM RETIRED BACK A STEP OR TWO FROM HIS CHAIR
DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT I HEARD THE RAIN STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
I MIGHT SAY NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE MANSION
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
BUT IF HE DOES THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SETTLE IT BUT HOW WILL THAT SETTLE IT ASKED CECILY
I WAS LOADED WITH GENERAL OPPROBRIUM UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
ADDED BESSIE IN NO HARSH VOICE YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE USEFUL AND PLEASANT THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE A HOME HERE BUT IF YOU BECOME PASSIONATE AND RUDE MISSIS WILL SEND YOU AWAY I AM SURE BESIDES SAID MISS ABBOT
I GUESS YOU MEAN PRINCIPLE I SUGGESTED YES THAT'S IT AGREED PETER IT'S ALL RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE IT'S KIND OF PRAYING WITH YOUR FISTS OH CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM FIGHTING SARA
AND WHAT A SCREAM
I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE DO
AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE ALAS YES NO JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
I CAN NOW CONJECTURE READILY THAT THIS STREAK OF LIGHT WAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GLEAM FROM A LANTERN CARRIED BY SOME ONE ACROSS THE LAWN BUT THEN PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE REMOTE FROM THE NURSERY AND KITCHEN SOLEMN BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN TO BE SO SELDOM ENTERED THE HOUSE MAID ALONE CAME HERE ON SATURDAYS TO WIPE FROM THE MIRRORS AND THE FURNITURE A WEEK'S QUIET DUST
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
NO YOU ARE LESS THAN A SERVANT FOR YOU DO NOTHING FOR YOUR KEEP THERE SIT DOWN AND THINK OVER YOUR WICKEDNESS THEY HAD GOT ME BY THIS TIME INTO THE APARTMENT INDICATED BY MISSUS REED AND HAD THRUST ME UPON A STOOL
IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION TO ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF THORNS
VERY PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
ROGER IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO WASH HIS BUGGY BE OFF
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
IT ISN'T FAIR OH FELIX DON'T TALK LIKE THAT SAID CECILY SHOCKED GOD MUST BE FAIR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE REASON PETER PRAYS THREE TIMES A DAY REGULAR
ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
HER POTENT VOICE MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS QUITE A HERO AFTER ALL AND THE STING WENT OUT OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT OLD FIGHT WHEN WE ARRIVED BEHIND THE GRANARY THE OTHERS WERE ALL THERE
BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
PETER NO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT SAID UNCLE ALEC STERNLY I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WERE FIGHTING ABOUT BUT YOU MUST SETTLE YOUR QUARRELS IN A DIFFERENT FASHION REMEMBER MY COMMANDS FELIX PETER
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
DID YOU EVER FIGHT ASKED THE STORY GIRL ONCE I SAID BRIEFLY DREADING THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH PROMPTLY CAME WHO BEAT IT IS SOMETIMES A BITTER THING TO TELL THE TRUTH
I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG
EVEN IF YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO I S'POSE YOU THINK A HIRED BOY HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO PRAY FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL JUST PRAY FOR WHAT I PLEASE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME
AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
A BOY LIKE THAT HE SAID OUGHT NOT TO BE PUSHED JOSEPH ASSENTED HEARTILY
OTHER DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT AND DIAMOND LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD HAD VERY LITTLE TO EAT THAT DAY THE MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS PAY THE WEEK'S RENT
WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
AND ENOUGH LIKEWISE TO SERVE AS A BACKGROUND TO MY DESCRIPTION OF KIRSTY KIRSTY WAS A HIGHLAND WOMAN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE FARM SERVANTS LIVED SHE WAS A CHEERFUL GRACIOUS KIND WOMAN A WOMAN OF GOD'S MAKING ONE WOULD SAY
WILL IN A DEGREE BE AT HIS OWN OPTION AND CAN BE REGULATED BY AN ATTENTION TO HIS RESOURCES THE RICH MAY BE EXTRAVAGANT THE POOR CAN BE FRUGAL AND PRIVATE OPPRESSION MAY ALWAYS BE AVOIDED BY A JUDICIOUS SELECTION OF OBJECTS
MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE HALF SHE TOLD HIM AT ALL EVENTS
AND AS I HEAR GET ALONG NO FASTER THAN A BIG DRAY HORSE WITH TWO TONS BEHIND HIM SO THEY TELL ME YOUR MASTER'S NOT MINE SAID RUBY I MUST ATTEND TO MY OWN MASTER'S INTERESTS AND EAT ALL THAT IS GIVEN ME
THE CONSEQUENCE CLEARLY IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO COMMON MEASURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND OF COURSE NO GENERAL OR STATIONARY RULE BY WHICH THE ABILITY OF A STATE TO PAY TAXES CAN BE DETERMINED
THAT THE ACTIVE WEALTH OF KING'S COUNTY BEARS A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION TO THAT OF MONTGOMERY THAN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE SHOULD TAKE EITHER THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LANDS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AS A CRITERION THE WEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS UPON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF CAUSES
AND UPON A CERTAIN DAY JOSEPH TOOK HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AND NANNY AND JIM
THE LIGHT SHOWED THE WHITE MARK ON DIAMOND'S FOREHEAD BUT RUBY'S EYE SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE THOUGHT MORE LIGHT CAME OUT OF IT THAN WENT IN THIS IS WHAT HE SAW BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE HEARD
MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
AS FOR NANNY SHE HAD BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
A GREAT PUFF OF WIND CAME AGAINST HIM AND IN OBEDIENCE TO IT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WENT AS IT BLEW
WE CANNOT DENY THAT HE MADE MISSUS MITCHELL TOO IT IS VERY PUZZLING I CONFESS I REMEMBER ONCE THAT MY YOUNGEST BROTHER DAVIE A VERY LITTLE FELLOW THEN FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK PLAINLY
HE HEARD THE TWO HORSES TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN A STRANGE LANGUAGE WHICH YET SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE COULD UNDERSTAND AND TURN OVER IN HIS MIND IN ENGLISH THE FIRST WORDS HE HEARD WERE FROM DIAMOND WHO APPARENTLY HAD BEEN ALREADY QUARRELLING WITH RUBY
A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
SAID MISTER RAYMOND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU
THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
PERHAPS SHE MEANT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH OR RATHER PERHAPS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE ALWAYS DID SPEAK THE TRUTH BUT CERTAINLY SHE WOULD EXAGGERATE THINGS AND GIVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER LOOK THE BONES OF HER STORY MIGHT BE TRUE
WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
UPON A PRINCIPLE WHICH DISTRIBUTES THE PUBLIC BURDENS WITH SO UNEQUAL A HAND AND WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO IMPOVERISH AND OPPRESS THE CITIZENS OF SOME STATES WHILE THOSE OF OTHERS WOULD SCARCELY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN
BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
BECAUSE I WANTED TO GROW FAT YOU GREASE TUB OH MY TEETH AND TAIL I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HUMBUG WHY DID YOU WANT TO GET FAT THERE'S NO TRUTH TO BE GOT OUT OF YOU BUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING YOU AIN'T FIT TO BE A HORSE BECAUSE
BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH RUBY HAD GOT RESPECTABLY THIN AND DIAMOND RESPECTABLY STOUT THEY REALLY BEGAN TO LOOK FIT FOR DOUBLE HARNESS JOSEPH AND HIS WIFE GOT THEIR AFFAIRS IN ORDER
BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
WITH A WISDOM I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO COMPREHEND THOUGH I REMEMBER IT SHOCKED ME A LITTLE AT THE TIME ALL THIS SET ME THINKING BEFORE THE DRESSING OF LITTLE DAVIE WAS OVER I HAD MY QUESTION TO PUT TO KIRSTY IT WAS IN FACT THE SAME QUESTION
JOSEPH YOUR MASTER SHOULD GROW LEAN I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO BE LAME BUT THAT NO HORSE LEAST OF ALL AN ANGEL HORSE WOULD DO SO I MUST BE LAME AND SO I SPRAINED MY ANKLE FOR THE ANGEL HORSES HAVE ANKLES
THEY WOULD NEITHER BE SO GREAT IN THEIR DEGREE SO UNIFORM IN THEIR OPERATION NOR SO ODIOUS IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS THOSE WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY SPRING FROM QUOTAS UPON ANY SCALE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVISED
WELL I DON'T GRUDGE YOURS WHAT HE GETS BY ME SAID RUBY GETS RETORTED DIAMOND WHAT HE GETS ISN'T WORTH GRUDGING IT COMES TO NEXT TO NOTHING WHAT WITH YOUR FAT AND SHINE
THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN CONSTANT OPPOSITION FAULT FINDING AND COMPLAINT THE REAL MISTAKE WAS THAT WE WERE BOYS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER ALTOGETHER ANTAGONISTIC TO THE BOY NATURE
HAVING MANY BLEAK MOORLAND HILLS THAT LAY ABOUT LIKE SLOW STIFFENED WAVES OF NO GREAT HEIGHT BUT OF MUCH DESOLATION AND AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION WAS CONCERNED IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MINDS OF FORMER GENERATIONS HAD BEEN AS BLEAK AS THE COUNTRY
BETTER BUT FALL ASLEEP BETWEEN EVERY STEP YOU'LL RUN A GOOD CHANCE OF LAMING ALL YOUR ANKLES AS YOU CALL THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IT'S NOT YOUR LIVELY HORSE THAT COMES TO GRIEF IN THAT WAY
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE STABLE LOOK AT THE HORSE NEXT YOU HE'S SOMETHING LIKE A HORSE ALL SKIN AND BONE AND HIS MASTER AIN'T OVER KIND TO HIM EITHER HE PUT A STINGING LASH ON HIS WHIP LAST WEEK BUT THAT OLD HORSE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN TO KEEP
HIS OPINION OF HIM WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM NANNY'S
BY THEIR VERY NATURE BE ABOUT SOMETHING AMISS I HAVE OCCASIONALLY WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED TO A GIRL ON REFLECTION I THINK A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FROM HER AS WE DID
IN ALL SITUATIONS A FORMIDABLE OBJECTION IN A BRANCH OF TAXATION WHERE NO LIMITS TO THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIXED RULE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE END
AND DIAMOND'S CHIEF PLEASURE SEEMED TO BE TO LIE AMONGST THEM AND BREATHE THE PURE AIR BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS DREAMING OF THE COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND AND TRYING TO RECALL THE SONGS THE RIVER USED TO SING FOR THIS WAS MORE LIKE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
THE NORTH WIND OFTEN BLEW WHEN DIAMOND WENT TO HIS BED WHICH WAS IN A TINY ROOM IN THE ROOF HE HEARD IT LIKE THE SEA MOANING AND WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP HE STILL HEARD THE MOANING ALL AT ONCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
FOR HER FACE I THINK THAT WAS RATHER QUEER
THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE TO REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF A CONFEDERACY BY ANY SUCH RULE CANNOT FAIL TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF GLARING INEQUALITY AND EXTREME OPPRESSION THIS INEQUALITY WOULD OF ITSELF
WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
PROPER FOR SUCH IMPOSITIONS IF INEQUALITIES SHOULD ARISE IN SOME STATES FROM DUTIES ON PARTICULAR OBJECTS THESE WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY
SAID NOT IN A QUESTIONING BUT IN A CONCLUDING TONE GOD DIDN'T MAKE THE FEES KIRSTY OH YES DAVIE GOD MADE EVERYTHING GOD DID MAKE THE FLEAS SAID KIRSTY DAVIE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE
AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM
IT'S MY BELIEF ONCE OUT THEY'D STICK OUT FOR EVER TALK OF KICKING WHY DON'T YOU PUT ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAB THE ABUSE MASTER GETS FOR YOUR SAKE IS QUITE SHAMEFUL NO DECENT HORSE WOULD BRING IT ON HIM
IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE CONFEDERATION
MUST BE RENOUNCED USURPATION MAY REAR ITS CREST IN EACH STATE AND TRAMPLE UPON THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COULD LEGALLY
I SHALL NOW PROCEED IN THE ENUMERATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE DEFECTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO DISAPPOINTED OUR HOPES FROM THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED AMONG OURSELVES TO FORM A SAFE AND SATISFACTORY JUDGMENT OF THE PROPER REMEDY IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
SAID OLD DIAMOND YOU ARE SO PLUMP AND YOUR SKIN SHINES SO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THERE'S NO HARM IN BEING FAT SAID RUBY IN A DEPRECATING TONE NO NOR IN BEING SLEEK I MAY AS WELL SHINE AS NOT
DIAMOND OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE STAIR AND INTO THE YARD HIS LITTLE HEART WAS IN A FLUTTER FOR HE HAD LONG GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN NEITHER NOW WAS HE TO SEE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT
BUT HE HELPED HIS FATHER STILL BOTH IN THE STABLE AND THE HARNESS ROOM AND GENERALLY WENT WITH HIM ON THE BOX THAT HE MIGHT LEARN TO DRIVE A PAIR AND BE READY TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR MISTER RAYMOND ADVISED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF LIBERTY
TILL SOME TIME AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS TOO SHY TO GO AND INQUIRE ABOUT HER BUT WHEN AT LENGTH SHE WENT TO LIVE WITH DIAMOND'S FAMILY
CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
OR OF CONTRAVENING OR EXPLAINING AWAY A PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN OF LATE A REPEATED THEME OF THE EULOGIES OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE WANT OF WHICH IN THAT PLAN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH PLAUSIBLE ANIMADVERSION AND SEVERE CRITICISM
PEOPLE'S KIND TO LAME BOYS YOU KNOW SIR BUT AFTER DARK THERE AIN'T SO MUCH DOING DIAMOND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING JIM TO MISTER RAYMOND AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE RESOLVED TO GIVE THE BOY A CHANCE HE PROVIDED NEW CLOTHES FOR BOTH HIM AND NANNY
THERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR HUGE CARCASS CRUSHING DOWN YOUR POOR LEGS ALL NIGHT LONG YOU DON'T EVEN CARE FOR YOUR OWN LEGS SO LONG AS YOU CAN EAT EAT AND SLEEP SLEEP YOU A HORSE INDEED BUT I TELL YOU I WAS LAME
KEEP OUT OF MY WAY YOU UNWORTHY WRETCH OR I'LL BITE YOU YOU A HORSE
HE PICKED IT UP AND RAN BACK AND OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND WENT IN
AND THE MOST OF THE WILD FLOWERS RISE EARLY TO BE BEFORE THE LEAVES BECAUSE IF THEY DID NOT
THE GENIUS OF THE CITIZENS THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION THEY POSSESS THE STATE OF COMMERCE OF ARTS OF INDUSTRY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY MORE TOO COMPLEX MINUTE OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ADMIT OF A PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION
IN A RATHER DIFFERENT TONE I SAY DIAMOND I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE AN HONEST OLD HORSE LIKE YOU THINK OF ME LIKE THAT I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THAT I FELL LAME I TOLD YOU SO RETURNED THE OTHER
DURING WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TALKING OF HER NEW PROSPECTS THAT NANNY EXPRESSED TO DIAMOND HER OPINION OF THE COUNTRY THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT BUT THE SUN AND MOON DIAMOND THERE'S TREES AND FLOWERS SAID DIAMOND
HE SHOT HIS HEAD OVER THE PARTITION AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SAID YOU JUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW AND YOU'LL SEE WHETHER I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR NOT I DECLARE THE OLD HORSE IS FAST ASLEEP DIAMOND NO I WON'T
IT WILL APPEAR FROM THE SPECIMENS WHICH HAVE BEEN CITED THAT THE AMERICAN CONFEDERACY IN THIS PARTICULAR STANDS DISCRIMINATED FROM EVERY OTHER INSTITUTION OF A SIMILAR KIND AND EXHIBITS A NEW AND UNEXAMPLED PHENOMENON IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
THE WEATHER WAS VERY HOT AND THE WOODS VERY SHADOWY THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY WILD FLOWERS
WOULD TURN AGAIN TO HIS BOOK OR HIS SERMON SAYING VERY WELL MISSUS MITCHELL
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OR I'LL BREAK MY HALTER AND BE AT YOU WITH YOUR HANDSOME FAT NEVER MIND DIAMOND YOU'RE A GOOD HORSE YOU CAN'T HURT ME CAN'T HURT YOU JUST LET ME ONCE TRY NO YOU CAN'T WHY THEN
BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
IF WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPAIR THE FORCE OF THIS APPLAUDED PROVISION WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNITED STATES AFFORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE OF A GOVERNMENT DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE SHADOW OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF ITS OWN LAWS
DEPEND UPON IT RUBY NO CABMAN LIKES TO BE ABUSED ANY MORE THAN HIS FARE
THE NATURAL CURE FOR AN ILL ADMINISTRATION IN A POPULAR OR REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION IS A CHANGE OF MEN A GUARANTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE AS MUCH LEVELLED AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF RULERS AS AGAINST THE FERMENTS AND OUTRAGES OF FACTION AND SEDITION IN THE COMMUNITY
THERE I'VE DONE I'M GOING TO SLEEP I'LL TRY TO THINK AS WELL OF YOU AS I CAN IF YOU WOULD BUT STEP OUT A BIT AND RUN OFF A LITTLE OF YOUR FAT HERE DIAMOND BEGAN TO DOUBLE UP HIS KNEES BUT RUBY SPOKE AGAIN AND AS YOUNG DIAMOND THOUGHT
MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
INDEED THEY ARE WELL YOU SEE DIAMOND I DON'T WANT TO GO LAME AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SO VERY LAME AFTER ALL THERE OH BUT I WAS
IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
AND SHE MIGHT BE CLOSE BESIDE HIM DEAR NORTH WIND SAID DIAMOND I WANT SO MUCH TO GO TO YOU BUT I CAN'T TELL WHERE COME HERE DIAMOND WAS ALL HER ANSWER
BUT THE DOOR IS LOCKED HE KNEW WHERE THE KEY WAS IN A CERTAIN HOLE IN THE WALL FAR TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO GET AT HE RAN TO THE PLACE HOWEVER
THAT THEY CONTAIN IN THEIR OWN NATURE A SECURITY AGAINST EXCESS THEY PRESCRIBE THEIR OWN LIMIT WHICH CANNOT BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT DEFEATING THE END PROPOSED THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE WHEN APPLIED TO THIS OBJECT
REVEALED THAT IF HE WAS NOT ALREADY ASLEEP HE WAS PAST UNDERSTANDING A WORD THAT RUBY WAS SAYING WHEN YOUNG DIAMOND FOUND THIS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE UP THE DROPT SHUTTLECOCK OF THE CONVERSATION I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT RUBY
THEY DON'T TALK HORSE SLANG UP THERE AND IT HURT ME VERY MUCH I ASSURE YOU DIAMOND THOUGH YOU MAYN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT OLD DIAMOND MADE NO REPLY HE HAD LAIN DOWN AGAIN AND A SLEEPY SNORT VERY LIKE A SNORE
AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT AND HAS SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED FROM THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BEEN MADE OF IT I SPEAK OF IT NOW SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO EQUALITY AMONG THE STATES
EVERY POSSIBLE PRIVILEGE IN THEIR NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES I MEANT TO DO IT DIAMOND AT THE WORDS THE OLD HORSE AROSE WITH A SCRAMBLE LIKE THUNDER SHOT HIS ANGRY HEAD AND GLARING EYE OVER INTO RUBY'S STALL AND SAID
THEY THINK I'M SILLY ADDED DIAMOND WITH ONE OF HIS SWEETEST SMILES WHAT MISTER RAYMOND THOUGHT I DARE HARDLY ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN HERE
THIS FORMS A COMPLETE BARRIER AGAINST ANY MATERIAL OPPRESSION OF THE CITIZENS BY TAXES OF THIS CLASS AND IS ITSELF A NATURAL LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF IMPOSING THEM IMPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND USUALLY FALL UNDER THE DENOMINATION OF INDIRECT TAXES
I KNOW HE CAN SHINE BOOTS SIR SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR US
WHICH PRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE NATIONAL WEALTH MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NO COMMON STANDARD OR BAROMETER BY WHICH THE DEGREES OF IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE OLDER WE GREW THE MORE OUR MINDS WERE ALIENATED FROM HER AND THE MORE WE CAME TO REGARD HER AS OUR ENEMY IF SHE REALLY MEANT TO BE OUR FRIEND AFTER THE BEST FASHION SHE KNEW IT WAS AT LEAST AN UNCOMELY KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
RUBY TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN PULLING AT HIS HAYRACK IN SILENCE DIAMOND GAVE A SHIVER AND LOOKING ROUND SAW THAT THE DOOR OF THE STABLE WAS OPEN
ONCE I AM FAT MY NATURE IS TO KEEP FAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MASTER MIGHT COME HOME AND WANT TO SEE ME YOU CONCEITED GOOD FOR NOTHING BRUTE YOU'RE ONLY FIT FOR THE KNACKER'S YARD YOU WANTED TO LOOK HANDSOME DID YOU
HE ASKED I'M ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING SIR ANSWERED DIAMOND WELL THAT'S QUITE RIGHT SO LONG AS WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING ONLY WE DON'T MENTION IT
AND BE SLEEK AND FAT AS I CAN AND GO NO FASTER THAN I NEED NOW REALLY IF THE REST OF THE HORSES WEREN'T ALL ASLEEP POOR THINGS THEY WORK TILL THEY'RE TIRED
HE JUMPED OUT OF BED AND LOOKED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT SEE HER DIAMOND COME HERE SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WHERE THE HERE WAS HE COULD NOT TELL TO BE SURE THE ROOM WAS ALL BUT QUITE DARK
AND EVERYTHING READY FOR MIGRATING AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO BE A BOY WAS IN HER EYES TO BE SOMETHING WRONG TO BEGIN WITH
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAVING IN THE THREE LAST NUMBERS TAKEN A SUMMARY REVIEW OF THE PRINCIPAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS WHICH HAVE DEPICTED THE GENIUS AND FATE OF OTHER CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENTS
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO SING THESE WERE VERY DIFFERENT TIMES FROM THOSE WHEN HE USED TO DRIVE THE CAB BUT YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT DIAMOND WAS IDLE HE DID NOT DO SO MUCH FOR HIS MOTHER NOW BECAUSE NANNY OCCUPIED HIS FORMER PLACE
BEFORE SHE LAID OUT ANYTHING EVEN ON FOOD HIS FATHER HAD BEEN VERY GLOOMY SO GLOOMY THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CROSS TO HIS WIFE IT IS A STRANGE THING HOW PAIN OF SEEING THE SUFFERING OF THOSE WE LOVE WILL SOMETIMES MAKE US ADD TO THEIR SUFFERING
ANKLE INDEED WHY SHOULD YOU APE YOUR BETTERS HORSES AIN'T GOT ANY ANKLES
FOR MISTER RAYMOND WAS AN OLD BACHELOR NO LONGER HE WAS BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM TO LIVE AT THE MOUND THE MOMENT NANNY SAW HER SHE RECOGNISED HER AS THE LADY WHO HAD LENT HER THE RUBY RING THAT RING HAD BEEN GIVEN HER BY MISTER RAYMOND
THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
YOU GO ALONG LIKE A BUTTOCK OF BEEF UPON CASTORS YOU DO AIN'T YOU AFRAID I'LL KICK IF YOU GO ON LIKE THAT DIAMOND
WITH A VERY STRAIGHT BACK AND A VERY LONG UPPER LIP INDEED THE DISTANCE FROM HER NOSE TO HER MOUTH WAS GREATER THAN THE LENGTH OF HER NOSE WHEN I THINK OF HER FIRST IT IS ALWAYS AS MAKING SOME COMPLAINT TO MY FATHER AGAINST US
HE SAID BUT RUBY NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD OR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM I SUPPOSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND MORE OF ENGLISH THAN JUST WHAT THE COACHMAN AND STABLEMAN WERE IN THE HABIT OF ADDRESSING HIM WITH FINDING HOWEVER THAT HIS COMPANION MADE NO REPLY
AFTER DOING EVERYTHING THAT FELL TO HIS SHARE THE BOY HAD A WEALTH OF TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL AND A HAPPY SOMETIMES A MERRY TIME IT WAS
FOR I WAS ALWAYS RATHER DELICATE AND IF I TOOK A DISLIKE TO ANYTHING WOULD RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN EAT OR DRINK OF IT BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HER TO MAKE IT PLAIN THAT SHE COULD BE NO FAVOURITE WITH US
IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED OF BEING A HORSE YOU DARE TO SAY MY MASTER AIN'T YOUR MASTER THAT'S YOUR GRATITUDE FOR THE WAY HE FEEDS YOU AND SPARES YOU PRAY WHERE WOULD YOUR CARCASS BE IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM
OR BY ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL MODE THERE IS NO EXPRESS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THEM TO USE FORCE AGAINST DELINQUENT MEMBERS
THE SAYING IS AS JUST AS IT IS WITTY THAT IN POLITICAL ARITHMETIC TWO AND TWO DO NOT ALWAYS MAKE FOUR IF DUTIES ARE TOO HIGH THEY LESSEN THE CONSUMPTION THE COLLECTION IS ELUDED
THE WANT OF A MUTUAL GUARANTY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER CAPITAL IMPERFECTION IN THE FEDERAL PLAN THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DECLARED IN THE ARTICLES THAT COMPOSE IT
WELL AT LEAST YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL YOU'RE THE BETTER FOR IT YOU GET A TWO HOURS REST A DAY OUT OF IT I THANK MY MASTER FOR THAT NOT YOU YOU LAZY FELLOW
WHETHER SHE WAS NICE LOOKING OR NOT
MAY SERVE AS A STANDARD THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE AND THE POPULOUSNESS OF A COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS NEARLY CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND AS A RULE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED NUMBERS IN THE VIEW OF SIMPLICITY AND CERTAINTY ARE ENTITLED TO A PREFERENCE
NO HARM RETORTED DIAMOND
BUT THERE'S YOUNG DIAMOND LISTENING TO ALL WE'RE SAYING AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN FOR ANGELS TO RIDE UPON AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIONS AND EAGLES AND BULLS IN MORE IMPORTANT SITUATIONS
AND WENT ON BLOWING SHE WANTS ME TO GO INTO THE STABLE
HE DOESN'T DO IT FOR MY SAKE IF I WERE HIS OWN HORSE HE WOULD WORK ME AS HARD AS HE DOES YOU AND I'M PROUD TO BE SO WORKED I WOULDN'T BE AS FAT AS YOU NOT FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH
CHAPTER FOUR KIRSTY MY FATHER HAD A HOUSEKEEPER A TRUSTY WOMAN HE CONSIDERED HER WE THOUGHT HER VERY OLD I SUPPOSE SHE WAS ABOUT FORTY SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR SHE WAS GRIM FACED AND CENSORIOUS
SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE GOT IT INTO OUR HEADS THAT THE SHORTNESS OF HER TEMPER WAS MYSTERIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTNESS OF HER NOSE SHE WAS SAVING EVEN TO STINGINESS SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO PROVIDE WHAT MY FATHER LIKED
IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
HE DIED ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE COCK CROWED AS NEAR AS WE CAN SAY SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PHYSICIAN WHO APPROACHING INQUIRED WITH MUCH INTEREST THE NATURE OF THE DISORDER GLANCING HER EYE OVER THE FIGURE OF THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE KATY INSTINCTIVELY ADJUSTING HER DRESS
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
STARTLED THE PRUDENT SURGEON AND WARNED HIM OF A TRITE SAYING IN THE CORPS THAT CAPTAIN LAWTON ALWAYS SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN THIS GROUP HAD ASSEMBLED IN ONE OF THE PARLORS AS THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE OVER THE EASTERN HILL DISPERSING THE COLUMNS OF FOG WHICH HAD ENVELOPED THE LOWLAND
THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
GOD WILL REWARD YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU HAVE DONE SAID MISS PEYTON MILDLY YES INTERRUPTED THE SPINSTER HASTILY AND WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE THAT WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION THAT DENOTED MORE OF WORLDLY CARE
I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
WHAT SAID THE SURGEON INTERRUPTING HER DOES HE AFFECT TO DESPISE THE NEEDLE BUT IT IS MY LOT TO MEET WITH MEN DAILY WHO ARE EQUALLY PERVERSE AND WHO SHOW A STILL MORE CULPABLE DISRESPECT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT FLOWS FROM THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE
HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
BESIDES WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE DEERSKIN PURSE BUT HARVEY IS LITTLE BETTER NOW THAN A BEGGAR AND A BEGGAR MISS JEANETTE IS THE MOST AWFULLY DESPISABLE OF ALL EARTHLY CREATURES
THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
I DOCTORED HIM MOSTLY WITH YARBS SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER SMILING AS IF CONSCIOUS OF ERROR WITH SIMPLES RETURNED THE SURGEON THEY ARE SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE UNLETTERED THAN MORE POWERFUL REMEDIES BUT WHY HAD YOU NO REGULAR ATTENDANT
PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
SOFTLY MY GOOD FRIEND SOFTLY SAID THE YOUTH FALLING BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND LOSING SOME OF THAT COLOR WHICH ALARMED HIS COMPANION I BELIEVE IN EXTRACTING THE BALL YOU DID FOR ME ALL THAT IS REQUIRED I AM FREE FROM PAIN AND ONLY WEAK I DO ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON WITH HEAT
UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
FOR MY PART I AM CLEAR FOR DOCTORING THOUGH HARVEY SAYS I AM KILLING MYSELF WITH MEDICINES
HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
WHY MA'AM THERE WERE IN THE IRON POT IN PLAIN SIGHT FIFTY FOUR GUINEAS OF GOLD BESIDES WHAT LAY UNDERNEATH WHICH I COULDN'T COUNT WITHOUT HANDLING AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO TOUCH IT FOR THEY SAY THAT ANOTHER'S GOLD IS APT TO STICK SO JUDGING FROM THAT IN SIGHT THERE WASN'T LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
THE SURGEON DREW UP AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN WHISTLING A LOW AIR AS HE LOOKED OVER SOME PHIALS ON A TABLE BUT THE HOUSEKEEPER TURNING TO HIM WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD CONTINUED I SUPPOSE SIR A WOMAN HAS NO DOWER IN HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY UNLESS THEY BE ACTUALLY MARRIED
IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
AND AS SUCH WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE SAID
THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
CONSCIOUS INTEREST KEPT HER TONGUE TIED UNTIL HER SISTER WITH THE FRANKNESS OF INNOCENCE HAD PUT THE DESIRED QUESTION TO DOCTOR SITGREAVES COLONEL WELLMERE SAID THE OPERATOR GRAVELY IS IN WHAT I CALL A STATE OF FREE WILL MADAM HE IS ILL OR HE IS WELL AS HE PLEASES
THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
EVERYTHING IS AS YOU LEFT IT BUT IT GLIDED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE GRACE OF A FAIRY AND THE TENDERNESS OF AN ANGEL
A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
INDEED I CAN EASILY COMPREHEND THE MORTIFICATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT IN HAVING ONE SO SELF WILLED TO DEAL WITH RETURNED THE SURGEON GLANCING HIS EYES REPROACHFULLY AT HIS COMRADE BUT YOU SHOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO SUCH OPINIONS AND PITY THE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THEY ARE ENGENDERED
TO THIS PART OF HIS SPEECH THEN SHE DIRECTED HER REPLY I DID THINK HE ONLY WAITED THE DEATH OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEFORE HE MARRIED SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER LOOKING ON THE CARPET BUT NOW HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN DESPISABLE OR WHAT'S THE SAME THING A PEDDLER WITHOUT HOUSE PACK OR MONEY
THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
BUT THEN I HAVE LEFT MY WAGES FOR THREE YEARS PAST IN THE HANDS OF HARVEY AND HOW AM I TO GET THEM MY BROTHERS TOLD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RELATIONS WERE EASILY SETTLED WERE YOU RELATED THEN TO BIRCH ASKED MISS PEYTON OBSERVING HER TO PAUSE
A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BODY HAD RISEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE FROM WHICH HE NEVER DEPARTED OF SLEEPING BUT SIX HOURS AT A TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW POINTS IN WHICH THE CARE OF THE HUMAN FRAME WAS INVOLVED ON WHICH THE TROOPER AND THE SURGEON OF HORSE WERE EVER KNOWN TO AGREE
WE CAN DIE SECUNDEM ARTEM CRIED THE TROOPER TO THIS OBSERVATION THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT DEIGN TO REPLY BUT DEEMING IT NECESSARY TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE HE ADDED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE JUDICIOUS TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE PROLONGED THE LIFE OF THE PATIENT
MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
THE TONGUE IS WELL AND THE PULSE BEGINS TO LOWER AGAIN AH THE BLEEDING DID YOU GOOD PHLEBOTOMY IS A SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC FOR SOUTHERN CONSTITUTIONS
TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
IT IS PRESUMPTUOUS IN YOU TO PRETEND TO TELL YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WHEN YOU ARE FREE FROM PAIN IF IT BE NOT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE IN SUCH MATTERS OF WHAT AVAIL THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE FOR SHAME GEORGE FOR SHAME EVEN THAT PERVERSE FELLOW JOHN LAWTON COULD NOT BEHAVE WITH MORE OBSTINACY
WHY GEORGE YOUR CASE IS BECOMING SINGULAR CONTINUED THE DOCTOR INSTINCTIVELY THROWING ASIDE HIS WIG YOUR PULSE EVEN AND SOFT YOUR SKIN MOIST BUT YOUR EYE FIERY AND CHEEK FLUSHED OH I MUST EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY INTO THESE SYMPTOMS
BUT MY HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF A SQUADRON IN THE FIELD AND USING IT WHEN THERE I BEG LEAVE TO REFER YOU TO DOCTOR ARCHIBALD SITGREAVES A GENTLEMAN OF UNIVERSAL ATTAINMENTS AND UNBOUNDED PHILANTHROPY THE VERY MILK OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND A MORTAL FOE TO ALL INDISCRIMINATE CUTTING
ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
IT WAS A MAXIM WITH DOCTOR SITGREAVES THAT NO SPECIES OF KNOWLEDGE WAS TO BE DESPISED AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS AN EMPIRIC IN EVERYTHING BUT HIS PROFESSION AT FIRST INDIGNATION AT THE IRONY OF HIS COMRADE KEPT HIM SILENT BUT SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS PURPOSE
WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
AND THE METALS PRODUCED IN THE MINES AND THE PLANTS GROW IN THE FIELDS AND IN GENERAL HOW ALL THE BODIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED MIXED OR COMPOSITE MIGHT BE GENERATED AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE DISCOVERIES ALLUDED TO
OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF GETTING DISSECTED IN THEIR PRESENCE THE HEART OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL POSSESSED OF LUNGS
OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCESS WERE JUST READY TO SET OUT WITH THE KING WHEN THEY SAW ADVANCING TOWARD THEM FROM THE END OF THE LONG GALLERY TWO GREAT BASILISKS DRAGGING AFTER THEM A VERY BADLY MADE BOX
FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE THEM MY COMPASSION THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS QUITE OVERCOME BY THE PRINCESS'S GOOD NATURED WAY OF TAKING HIS INTERFERENCE AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET HE KISSED HER HAND A THOUSAND TIMES
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I WISHED TO TALK TO THE FAIRY DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF ANY FURTHER TROUBLE PRINCESS ANSWERED THE DWARF I CAN TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THAN SHE COULD
THE UNHAPPY QUEEN SEEING ALL AT ONCE WHAT A MISERABLE LIFE HER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE WITH THIS DWARF COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA AND FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WHEN SHE REVIVED
FOR ALL ROUND THE GREAT BANQUETING HALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED A THOUSAND BARRELS FULL OF GOLD AND NUMBERLESS BAGS MADE OF VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND FILLED WITH MONEY EACH ONE CONTAINING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND GOLD PIECES
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HER PRETTY ONE SAID THE LITTLE MONSTER FOR I AM A FRIEND OF HERS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I AM QUITE AS CLEVER AS SHE IS THE QUEEN MY MOTHER REPLIED THE PRINCESS
OUT OF CHARITY I WILL TAKE HER BUT BE SURE AND DON'T FORGET THAT SHE IS MINE AS HE SPOKE A LITTLE DOOR OPENED IN THE TRUNK OF THE ORANGE TREE
LIGHTEN MY SORROW WITH SOFT TEARS ALAS ALAS I SEE NO MORE MY LOVE WHO YET MY SADNESS CHEERS AND THOU O RAGING STORMY SEA
WHICH WERE GIVEN AWAY TO EVERYONE WHO LIKED TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HASTENED TO DO YOU MAY BE SURE INDEED SOME FOUND THIS BY FAR THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES
NOW THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AS SHE WAS GUARDED BY SOME TERRIBLE LIONS BUT HAPPILY THE QUEEN HAD HEARD A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT WHOEVER WANTED TO PASS THESE LIONS SAFELY MUST THROW TO THEM A CAKE MADE OF MILLET FLOUR
SO MAKING HIM MOUNT HER CHARIOT TO WHICH SHE HAD HARNESSED SWANS INSTEAD OF THE BATS WHICH GENERALLY DREW IT AWAY SHE FLEW WITH HIM BUT IMAGINE THE DISTRESS OF THE PRINCE WHEN FROM THE GIDDY HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY WERE RUSHING THROUGH THE AIR
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT
PRETENDING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BED BUT INSTEAD OF THAT SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A LONG WHITE VEIL AND WENT DOWN A SECRET STAIRCASE AND SET OFF ALL BY HERSELF TO FIND THE WITCH BUT WHEN SHE GOT AS FAR AS THE SAME FATAL ORANGE TREE
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A GAYER COURT TWENTY DELIGHTFUL KINGS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO MAKE THEMSELVES AGREEABLE AND AFTER HAVING SPENT EVER SO MUCH MONEY IN GIVING A SINGLE ENTERTAINMENT
SO SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HER PRISONER'S BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE
SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
AND MANY LITTLE BROOKS MURMURED SOFTLY UNDER THE SHADY TREES WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS COOL AND FRESH A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE OF TRANSPARENT EMERALDS
WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
AND FOR EVER MISERABLE CREATURE LEST I TAKE YOUR LIFE AND SO RID MYSELF OF YOUR MALICE HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN THE LID OF THE BOX FELL BACK ON THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIBLE NOISE
AH PRINCE SHE SAID CAN I BELIEVE THAT YOU REALLY LOVE ME SO MUCH TIME WILL SHOW MADAM REPLIED THE KING BUT IF YOU WISH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU HAVE SOME REGARD FOR ME DO NOT I BEG OF YOU
THE YELLOW DWARF DEEPLY ENRAGED AT THESE WORDS SET SPURS TO HIS CAT WHICH YELLED HORRIBLY AND LEAPED HITHER AND THITHER TERRIFYING EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE BRAVE KING WHO PURSUED THE DWARF CLOSELY TILL HE
AND SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON A CRUTCH THIS STRANGE OLD WOMAN WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD HOBBLED THREE TIMES ROUND THE GALLERY FOLLOWED BY THE BASILISKS THEN STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE
NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
DRAWING A GREAT KNIFE WITH WHICH HE WAS ARMED CHALLENGED THE KING TO MEET HIM IN SINGLE COMBAT AND RUSHED DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WITH A TERRIBLE CLATTER THE KING QUITE PROVOKED FOLLOWED HIM HASTILY
THE KING SIGHED BUT MADE NO ANSWER INDEED WHAT WAS THERE TO BE SAID TO SUCH A CLEAR SIGHTED PERSON AT LAST THEY REACHED A VAST MEADOW GAY WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOWERS A DEEP RIVER SURROUNDED IT
AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE ME ALWAYS WITH HER HANDSOME AGREEABLE AND GAY AS YOU SEE ME NOW FOR IF HER SHADOW STAYS BY HER MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO I SHALL BE SURPRISED
SHE GAVE HIM BACK HIS SIGHT BUT WITHOUT RELEASING HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND BY HER MAGIC POWER SHE APPEARED BEFORE HIM AS A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL FAIRY AND PRETENDED TO HAVE COME THERE QUITE BY CHANCE WHAT DO I SEE SHE CRIED
I AM TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MATTER FOR HER TO PROMISE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY CONSENT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS CRIED THE DWARF SUDDENLY
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A DWARF THAT YOU ARE SO UGLY THAT ONE CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK AT YOU AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU MYSELF LONG BEFORE THIS IF YOU HAD BEEN WORTHY OF SUCH A GLORIOUS DEATH
EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT UPON EACH IT HAD A DIFFERENT EFFECT ONE FELL ILL ONE WENT QUITE CRAZY
I SHALL PRETEND TO HATE HER UNTIL I AM SET FREE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT QUITE TAKEN IN BY THESE WORDS RESOLVED AT ONCE TO TRANSPORT THE PRINCE TO A PLEASANTER PLACE
AND MAKE A GREATER TRIUMPH HIS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THEM SING OF HER TRIUMPHS SHE LED THE KING INTO THE MOST SPLENDID ROOM THAT CAN BE IMAGINED AND LEFT HIM ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
RASH YOUTH HE CRIED RUSHING BETWEEN THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT AND THE KING DARE TO LAY A FINGER UPON THIS ILLUSTRIOUS FAIRY YOUR QUARREL IS WITH ME ONLY I AM YOUR ENEMY AND YOUR RIVAL
AS THROUGH THIS ENCHANTED LAND
THOUGHT THEMSELVES VERY LUCKY IF THE PRINCESS SAID THAT'S PRETTY ALL THIS ADMIRATION VASTLY PLEASED THE QUEEN NOT A DAY PASSED BUT SHE RECEIVED SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND SONNETS
WHO CAME TO MEET THEM JOYFULLY SINGING THESE WORDS WHEN LOVE WITHIN A HEART WOULD REIGN USELESS TO STRIVE AGAINST HIM TIS THE PROUD BUT FEEL A SHARPER PAIN
IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
STIRRED BY WILD WINDS FROM DEPTH TO HEIGHT THOU HOLD'ST MY LOVED ONE FAR FROM ME AND I AM CAPTIVE TO THY MIGHT MY HEART IS STILL MORE WILD THAN THINE
AND THAT NEITHER OF THESE WAS THE REAL REASON OF THE QUEEN'S UNEASINESS SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD GO AND CONSULT THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD HOW WISE SHE WAS
AND THEN UP THE TREE AND THERE SHE SAW A LITTLE TINY MAN WHO WAS EATING ORANGES OH QUEEN SAID HE I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW MUCH AFRAID YOU ARE OF THE LIONS
SUGAR CANDY AND CROCODILE'S EGGS THIS CAKE SHE PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PUTTING IT IN A LITTLE BASKET SHE SET OUT TO SEEK THE FAIRY BUT AS SHE WAS NOT USED TO WALKING FAR
I MUST MAKE UP MY MIND TO DIE SAID THE POOR QUEEN ALAS I SHOULD NOT CARE SO MUCH IF ONLY MY DEAR DAUGHTER WERE MARRIED OH YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER CRIED THE YELLOW DWARF
WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
REFUSE TO AID BELLISSIMA DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FROWNING AND LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY DO YOU WANT ME TO EMPLOY MY ART AGAINST THE YELLOW DWARF WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND
MAY I BURN MY CRUTCH AH PRINCESS SAID THE QUEEN WEEPING WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR WHAT HAVE YOU PROMISED AH MY MOTHER REPLIED BELLISSIMA SADLY
YOU HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF DYING UNMARRIED A LOVELY PRINCESS LIKE YOU MUST SURELY PREFER TO DIE RATHER THAN BE THE WIFE OF A POOR LITTLE DWARF LIKE MYSELF OH DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME CRIED THE PRINCESS CLASPING HER HANDS
HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
AND AS HE HAD NO HAIR AND VERY LONG EARS HE LOOKED ALTOGETHER A SHOCKING LITTLE OBJECT I AM DELIGHTED
BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
EXCEPT THE BEAUTY OF THE PRINCESS UPON HER HEAD SHE WORE A SPLENDID CROWN HER LOVELY HAIR WAVED NEARLY TO HER FEET AND HER STATELY FIGURE COULD EASILY BE DISTINGUISHED AMONG ALL THE LADIES WHO ATTENDED HER
AND BRANDISHING HER CRUTCH THREATENINGLY SHE CRIED
THAT I FEAR THAT SHE WILL DIE AND I AM AFRAID THAT PERHAPS I AM THE CAUSE OF IT FOR SHE VERY MUCH WISHES ME TO BE MARRIED
AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY SEE AT ALL THE THUNDER CRASHED AND THE LIGHTNING SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BURN UP EVERYTHING THE TWO BASILISKS APPEARED
THIS IS ONE THAT SHE LIKED VERY MUCH
LIKE GIANTS MOUNTAINS HIGH AND FIRE FLEW FROM THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE FLAMING FURNACES NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD TERRIFY THE NOBLE YOUNG KING AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LOOKS AND ACTIONS REASSURED THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON
THE QUEEN WAS SO CONFUSED THAT AT FIRST SHE DID NOT NOTICE ANOTHER LITTLE DOOR IN THE ORANGE TREE BUT PRESENTLY IT OPENED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A FIELD OF THISTLES AND NETTLES IT WAS ENCIRCLED BY A MUDDY DITCH
SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
AND NEVER TRIED TO CORRECT ANY OF HER FAULTS THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THIS LITTLE PERSON WHO WAS AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE AND WAS ONE DAY TO WEAR A CROWN
THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD ALSO SEEN BELLISSIMA AND SHE TRIED TO READ IN THE KING'S EYES THE EFFECT THAT THIS UNEXPECTED SIGHT HAD HAD UPON HIM NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN SAID HE
AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY ALREADY YOU SEE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME
AS SOON AS HE LOST SIGHT OF ME BUT WHO CAN MY RIVAL BE WHOSE FATAL BEAUTY IS GREATER THAN MINE WHILE SHE WAS SAYING THIS THE KING WHO REALLY LOVED HER AS MUCH AS EVER
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
AND YOU WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU ARE WRETCHED LITTLE MONSTER SAID THE KING DO YOU DARE TO CALL YOURSELF THE PRINCESS'S LOVER AND TO LAY CLAIM TO SUCH A TREASURE
AND SEEING UPON A TABLE A GRANDER COAT THAN HIS OWN HE PUT IT ON CAREFULLY THE FAIRY CAME BACK SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER JOY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN TO PLEASE ME SAID SHE
WAS ABOUT BELLISSIMA FOR THAT WAS THE PRINCESS'S NAME AND ALL THE BONFIRES THAT THEY HAD WERE MADE OF THESE VERSES WHICH CRACKLED AND SPARKLED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF WOOD BELLISSIMA WAS ALREADY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
WHAT DID YOU PROMISE YOURSELF THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES INDIGNANT AT BEING KEPT FROM HIS HAPPINESS BY THIS WICKED OLD WOMAN WENT UP TO HER AND THREATENING HER WITH HIS SWORD SAID GET AWAY OUT OF MY COUNTRY AT ONCE
AND NEARER WHAT SHALL I DO SHE CRIED MUST ALL MY HAPPY DAYS COME TO AN END LIKE THIS THE MALICIOUS DWARF LOOKED AT HER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH SPITEFULLY AT LEAST SAID HE
EVEN TO HER SHOES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH THEM AND HER DRESS OF SILVER BROCADE WAS EMBROIDERED WITH A DOZEN OF THE SUN'S RAYS YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW MUCH THESE HAD COST
AND I SHALL BE VERY ANGRY IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY ONE OF HER LOVERS CLEVER OR HANDSOME ENOUGH FOR HER
HOPING SHE MAY TREAD ON THEM
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE ROARING OF THE GREAT LIONS WHO HAD FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS NEAR AND WERE COMING TO LOOK FOR HER
CRIED THE DWARF ANGRILY BUT HERE ARE THE LIONS COMING THEY'LL EAT YOU UP IN THREE MOUTHFULS AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF YOU AND YOUR PRIDE AND INDEED AT THAT MOMENT THE POOR PRINCESS HEARD THEIR DREADFUL HOWLS COMING NEARER
THE QUEEN WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND SHE GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT TO GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS AND TO CHOOSE THE JEWELS THAT THE PRINCESS WAS TO WEAR THESE WERE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS
AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
JUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT HE WAS A PRISONER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD NOT REALLY GONE QUITE AWAY BUT WAS WATCHING HIM FROM SOME HIDING PLACE SO WALKING UP TO A GREAT MIRROR HE SAID TO IT
HOW SHE GOT THERE SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LACE AND RIBBONS AND ON HER FINGER WAS A LITTLE RING MADE OF A SINGLE RED HAIR
SEEING THAT I HAVE LOST THE BASKET OF CAKE
AND BEGGED HER TO FORGIVE HIM AT LAST THE HAPPY DAY CAME EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BELLISSIMA'S WEDDING THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED
AND AS MANY ELEGIES MADRIGALS AND SONGS WHICH WERE SENT HER BY ALL THE POETS IN THE WORLD
THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS NOT LESS NOBLE AND SPLENDID IT WAS EASY TO SEE BY HIS FACE HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND EVERYONE WHO WENT NEAR HIM RETURNED LOADED WITH PRESENTS
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY HIS CRUEL CAPTOR PRESENTLY AFTER WALKING WILDLY UP AND DOWN HE WROTE THESE VERSES UPON THE SAND WITH HIS STICK AT LAST MAY I UPON THIS SHORE
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND TAKE AWAY FROM HIM A PROUD PRINCESS
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS AND HOW ANGRY IT MADE ALL THE OTHER KINGS TO LOSE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF MARRYING THE PRINCESS BUT AFTER ALL
THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
AND SHE COULD NOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY OF GETTING RID OF THE LITTLE MONSTER THAN TO MARRY SOME POWERFUL KING THEREFORE SHE REPLIED TO THEIR REQUEST MUCH MORE FAVORABLY THAN THEY HAD HOPED SAYING THAT THOUGH SHE WAS VERY HAPPY AS SHE WAS
TRUSTY COUNSELLOR LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE TO THE CHARMING FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO PLEASE HER AND HE AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO CURL HIS HAIR
THE QUEEN CAUSED HER PORTRAIT TO BE TAKEN BY THE CLEVEREST PAINTERS AND SENT IT TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORING KINGS WITH WHOM SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY
AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBARRASSED THE YELLOW DWARF HIMSELF BUT EVEN HIS COURAGE GAVE WAY WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS BELOVED PRINCESS FOR THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT LOOKING MORE TERRIBLE THAN BEFORE MOUNTED UPON A WINGED GRIFFIN
AS SOON AS THE SWANS WHICH DREW THE FAIRY'S CHARIOT HAD ALIGHTED UNDER A PORCH WHICH WAS PAVED WITH DIAMONDS AND HAD ARCHES OF RUBIES THEY WERE GREETED ON ALL SIDES BY THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL BEINGS
I SHALL BE EATEN UP AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN A SINGLE STEP SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP
THE KING MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR LOOKED ON DESPAIRINGLY AT THIS DREADFUL OCCURRENCE WHICH HE WAS QUITE POWERLESS TO PREVENT AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS SIGHT FAILED HIM
SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO SOME FRIGHTFUL CAVERN AND CHAINED HIM TO A ROCK THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET BELLISSIMA AND BECOME HER SLAVE SO AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE PLACE
THE TERRIBLE LIONS AND HER PROMISE TO THE YELLOW DWARF THAT HE SHOULD MARRY BELLISSIMA MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM BUT THERE WAS THE NEW CAP WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL RIBBON AND LACE TO REMIND HER THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE WHICH MADE HER SO UNHAPPY
PREPARATIONS WERE BEGUN AT ONCE FOR THE GRANDEST WEDDING THAT HAD EVER BEEN HELD AT THE PALACE THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SENT SUCH IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY
GREW UP SO PROUD AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER OWN BEAUTY THAT SHE DESPISED EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN HER MOTHER BY HER CARESSES AND FLATTERIES HELPED TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER
HOW IS THIS WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR PITY ON THESE PRINCES WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY A SINGLE SMILE FROM YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY ANSWERED BELLISSIMA
AS FOR THE PRINCESS THE MORE SHE SAW OF THE KING THE MORE SHE LIKED HIM HE WAS SO GENEROUS SO HANDSOME AND CLEVER THAT AT LAST SHE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM AS HE WAS WITH HER
AND AS HE SPOKE THE QUEEN SAW THE LIONS WHICH WERE RUNNING DOWN A HILL TOWARD THEM EACH ONE HAD TWO HEADS EIGHT FEET AND FOUR ROWS OF TEETH
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE GAYEST AND MOST REFINED COURTS
ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
AT LAST THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM ANXIOUS TO SEE THEIR PRINCESS MARRIED SENT TO THE QUEEN TO BEG HER TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND FOR HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER BETTER
NOT A TRACE OF IT COULD SHE FIND THE MORE SHE HUNTED FOR IT THE MORE FRIGHTENED SHE GOT AND AT LAST SHE BEGAN TO CRY THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE SAW BEFORE HER THE YELLOW DWARF WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU MY PRETTY ONE SAID HE
YOU HESITATE MADAM CRIED THE DWARF
AND MUST TAKE CARE THAT IT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE IN THE ONE CASE HE IS AN OFFENDER AT OUR BAR
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PURPOSELY INFLICTED ON HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PUNISHMENT A PERSON WHO SHOWS RASHNESS OBSTINACY SELF CONCEIT WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHIN MODERATE MEANS WHO CANNOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM HURTFUL INDULGENCES
VESTED IN THE STATE ITSELF AND NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE WITHIN IT NO MENTION IS MADE OF A THIRD CLASS DIFFERENT FROM EITHER OF THESE
AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
WHO ARE THE ASCENDANT POWER IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT PERSONS OF THESE SENTIMENTS MAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COMMAND A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HOW WILL THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
TO THE FANATICAL MORAL INTOLERANCE OF THE PURITANS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS SAID OF THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING SOCIETY FROM THE BAD EXAMPLE SET TO OTHERS BY THE VICIOUS OR THE SELF INDULGENT IT IS TRUE THAT BAD EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT
AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THIS FACT MAY APPEAR IT HAS ITS EXPLANATION IN THE COMMON IDEAS AND CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD WHICH TEACHING WOMEN TO THINK MARRIAGE THE ONE THING NEEDFUL MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT MANY A WOMAN SHOULD PREFER BEING ONE OF SEVERAL WIVES
THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
HOW IT MAY BE ASKED CAN ANY PART OF THE CONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF SOCIETY BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS
BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ENTERTAINING ANY SUCH QUESTION WHEN A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF NO PERSONS BESIDES HIMSELF OR NEEDS NOT AFFECT THEM UNLESS THEY LIKE
WHO HAVE NO PART OR CONCERN IN IT LET THEM SEND MISSIONARIES IF THEY PLEASE TO PREACH AGAINST IT AND LET THEM BY ANY FAIR MEANS OF WHICH SILENCING THE TEACHERS IS NOT ONE OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF SIMILAR DOCTRINES AMONG THEIR OWN PEOPLE
AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
BUT THE ENORMITY OF ACTING OR FEELING DIFFERENTLY FROM ITSELF AND THIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT THINLY DISGUISED IS HELD UP TO MANKIND AS THE DICTATE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BY NINE TENTHS OF ALL MORALISTS AND SPECULATIVE WRITERS
OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
AS SOON AS ANY PART OF A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS PREJUDICIALLY THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS SOCIETY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GENERAL WELFARE WILL OR WILL NOT BE PROMOTED BY INTERFERING WITH IT BECOMES OPEN TO DISCUSSION
BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
WHICH ARE NOT SOCIAL BUT INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TO THIS CLASS SURELY THAT THE ACT OF DRINKING FERMENTED LIQUORS BELONGS SELLING FERMENTED LIQUORS HOWEVER IS TRADING AND TRADING IS A SOCIAL ACT BUT THE INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINED OF
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
INFLICTION ON THEM OF ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED BY HIS OWN RIGHTS FALSEHOOD OR DUPLICITY IN DEALING WITH THEM UNFAIR OR UNGENEROUS USE OF ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
SHOULD EVER SUCCEED IN REGAINING ITS LOST GROUND AS RELIGIONS SUPPOSED TO BE DECLINING HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN KNOWN TO DO TO IMAGINE ANOTHER CONTINGENCY PERHAPS MORE LIKELY TO BE REALISED THAN THE ONE LAST MENTIONED
THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
WE HAVE A RIGHT AND IT MAY BE OUR DUTY TO CAUTION OTHERS AGAINST HIM IF WE THINK HIS EXAMPLE OR CONVERSATION LIKELY TO HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT ON THOSE WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATES
THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
THAT THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE STRICTLY INSEPARABLE FROM THE UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO WHICH A PERSON SHOULD EVER BE SUBJECTED FOR THAT PORTION OF HIS CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WHICH CONCERNS HIS OWN GOOD
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
OR OTHER PREPONDERATING POWER IN THE COUNTRY AND ALL PERSONS MUST BE READY TO CONFORM TO THE IDEA OF A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE EARLY SETTLERS IN NEW ENGLAND IF A RELIGIOUS PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THEIRS
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
WHICH HAS BEEN FATAL TO THEIR PREDECESSORS I FULLY ADMIT THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH A PERSON DOES TO HIMSELF MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH THROUGH THEIR SYMPATHIES AND THEIR INTERESTS THOSE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH HIM
A RECENT WRITER IN SOME RESPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE MERIT PROPOSES TO USE HIS OWN WORDS NOT A CRUSADE BUT A CIVILIZADE AGAINST THIS POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
THIS IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IF HE IS EMINENT IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH CONDUCE TO HIS OWN GOOD HE IS SO FAR A PROPER OBJECT OF ADMIRATION HE IS SO MUCH THE NEARER TO THE IDEAL PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
WE HAVE A RIGHT ALSO IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ACT UPON OUR UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY ONE NOT TO THE OPPRESSION OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT IN THE EXERCISE OF OURS
HE MAY BE TO US AN OBJECT OF PITY PERHAPS OF DISLIKE BUT NOT OF ANGER OR RESENTMENT WE SHALL NOT TREAT HIM LIKE AN ENEMY OF SOCIETY THE WORST WE SHALL THINK OURSELVES JUSTIFIED IN DOING IS LEAVING HIM TO HIMSELF
THAT EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL SHALL ACT IN EVERY RESPECT EXACTLY AS HE OUGHT THAT WHOSOEVER FAILS THEREOF IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR VIOLATES MY SOCIAL RIGHT AND ENTITLES ME TO DEMAND FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMOVAL OF THE GRIEVANCE
FOR PROHIBITION OF THEIR SALE IS IN FACT AS IT IS INTENDED TO BE PROHIBITION OF THEIR USE AND THOUGH THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF EXECUTING THE LAW HAS CAUSED ITS REPEAL IN SEVERAL OF THE STATES WHICH HAD ADOPTED IT
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
WHO ARE EQUALLY INCAPABLE OF SELF GOVERNMENT IF GAMBLING OR DRUNKENNESS OR INCONTINENCE OR IDLENESS OR UNCLEANLINESS ARE AS INJURIOUS TO HAPPINESS AND AS GREAT A HINDRANCE TO IMPROVEMENT AS MANY OR MOST OF THE ACTS PROHIBITED BY LAW
BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
AND THE REPROBATION WHICH IS DUE TO HIM FOR AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS IS NOT A MERELY NOMINAL DISTINCTION IT MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE BOTH IN OUR FEELINGS AND IN OUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM
BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
IT IS EASY FOR ANY ONE TO IMAGINE AN IDEAL PUBLIC WHICH LEAVES THE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF INDIVIDUALS IN ALL UNCERTAIN MATTERS UNDISTURBED AND ONLY REQUIRES THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM MODES OF CONDUCT WHICH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE HAS CONDEMNED
AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
WHICH SOCIETY DOES NOT PRETEND IT HAS A RIGHT TO EXACT BUT I CANNOT CONSENT TO ARGUE THE POINT AS IF SOCIETY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING ITS WEAKER MEMBERS UP TO ITS ORDINARY STANDARD OF RATIONAL CONDUCT EXCEPT WAITING TILL THEY DO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
HARDLY ANY OFFENCE THAT IS COMMITTED WOULD DETRACT MORE FROM THE GENERAL SUM OF GOOD FINALLY IF BY HIS VICES OR FOLLIES A PERSON DOES NO DIRECT HARM TO OTHERS HE IS NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE SAID INJURIOUS BY HIS EXAMPLE
FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
THERE MUST BE SOME LENGTH OF TIME AND AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AFTER WHICH A MORAL OR PRUDENTIAL TRUTH MAY BE REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED AND IT IS MERELY DESIRED TO PREVENT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FROM FALLING OVER THE SAME PRECIPICE
I AM NOT WRITING AN ESSAY ON THE ABERRATIONS OF EXISTING MORAL FEELING THAT IS TOO WEIGHTY A SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSED PARENTHETICALLY
THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
IF THIS BE SO THE SOONER SUCH A CIVILISATION RECEIVES NOTICE TO QUIT THE BETTER IT CAN ONLY GO ON FROM BAD TO WORSE UNTIL DESTROYED AND REGENERATED LIKE THE WESTERN EMPIRE BY ENERGETIC BARBARIANS
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
CHAPTER FOUR OF THE LIMITS TO THE AUTHORITY OF SOCIETY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEN IS THE RIGHTFUL LIMIT TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OVER HIMSELF
DIIS CURAE IT REMAINS TO BE PROVED THAT SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS HOLDS A COMMISSION FROM ON HIGH TO AVENGE ANY SUPPOSED OFFENCE TO OMNIPOTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALSO A WRONG TO OUR FELLOW CREATURES
THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
BUT NEITHER ONE PERSON NOR ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS IS WARRANTED IN SAYING TO ANOTHER HUMAN CREATURE OF RIPE YEARS THAT HE SHALL NOT DO WITH HIS LIFE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT WHAT HE CHOOSES TO DO WITH IT HE IS THE PERSON MOST INTERESTED IN HIS OWN WELL BEING
NOR OCCASIONS PERCEPTIBLE HURT TO ANY ASSIGNABLE INDIVIDUAL EXCEPT HIMSELF THE INCONVENIENCE IS ONE WHICH SOCIETY CAN AFFORD TO BEAR FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREATER GOOD OF HUMAN FREEDOM IF GROWN PERSONS ARE TO BE PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING PROPER CARE OF THEMSELVES
THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
TO SEND AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THEM AND COMPEL THEM BY FORCE TO CONFORM TO THE OPINIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE THE ARTICLE OF THE MORMONITE DOCTRINE WHICH IS THE CHIEF PROVOCATIVE TO THE ANTIPATHY WHICH THUS BREAKS THROUGH THE ORDINARY RESTRAINTS OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IS ITS SANCTION OF POLYGAMY
THESE ARE MORAL VICES AND CONSTITUTE A BAD AND ODIOUS MORAL CHARACTER UNLIKE THE SELF REGARDING FAULTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WHICH ARE NOT PROPERLY IMMORALITIES AND TO WHATEVER PITCH THEY MAY BE CARRIED DO NOT CONSTITUTE WICKEDNESS
THE SMALL NUMBER WHO FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS MUST STILL WORK OBTAIN A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE OF EARNINGS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THOSE OCCUPATIONS IF THEY PREFER LEISURE TO EMOLUMENT IF A FURTHER REMEDY IS SOUGHT
WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
TO INDIVIDUALITY SHOULD BELONG THE PART OF LIFE IN WHICH IT IS CHIEFLY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS INTERESTED TO SOCIETY THE PART WHICH CHIEFLY INTERESTS SOCIETY THOUGH SOCIETY IS NOT FOUNDED ON A CONTRACT
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
TO PUT AN END TO WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A RETROGRADE STEP IN CIVILISATION IT ALSO APPEARS SO TO ME BUT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO FORCE ANOTHER TO BE CIVILISED
AND EVEN IT WILL BE ADDED IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISCONDUCT COULD BE CONFINED TO THE VICIOUS OR THOUGHTLESS INDIVIDUAL OUGHT SOCIETY TO ABANDON TO THEIR OWN GUIDANCE THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FOR IT
WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
OBLIGATORY ON ALL THE WORLD THE EVIL HERE POINTED OUT IS NOT ONE WHICH EXISTS ONLY IN THEORY AND IT MAY PERHAPS BE EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD SPECIFY THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PUBLIC OF THIS AGE AND COUNTRY IMPROPERLY INVESTS ITS OWN PREFERENCES
A CIVILISATION THAT CAN THUS SUCCUMB TO ITS VANQUISHED ENEMY MUST FIRST HAVE BECOME SO DEGENERATE THAT NEITHER ITS APPOINTED PRIESTS AND TEACHERS NOR ANYBODY ELSE HAS THE CAPACITY OR WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO STAND UP FOR IT
WITHOUT DOUBT ABSTINENCE ON ONE DAY IN THE WEEK SO FAR AS THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE PERMIT FROM THE USUAL DAILY OCCUPATION THOUGH IN NO RESPECT RELIGIOUSLY BINDING ON ANY EXCEPT JEWS IS A HIGHLY BENEFICIAL CUSTOM
BINDING ON OURSELVES AND ON ALL OTHERS WHAT CAN THE POOR PUBLIC DO BUT APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS OF GOOD AND EVIL IF THEY ARE TOLERABLY
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
BUT WHEN THE DISSENTIENTS HAVE CONCEDED TO THE HOSTILE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS FAR MORE THAN COULD JUSTLY BE DEMANDED WHEN THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE EARTH
IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXPECT BUT IN EACH PERSON'S OWN CONCERNS HIS INDIVIDUAL SPONTANEITY IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS TO AID HIS JUDGMENT EXHORTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN HIS WILL MAY BE OFFERED TO HIM
COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
AND IF ADMITTED WOULD FULLY JUSTIFY THEM
SOME PEOPLE'S OPINION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHILE VERY OFTEN IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC WITH THE MOST PERFECT INDIFFERENCE PASSING OVER THE PLEASURE OR CONVENIENCE OF THOSE WHOSE CONDUCT THEY CENSURE AND CONSIDERING ONLY THEIR OWN PREFERENCE
MERELY FROM WITHOUT IN THIS DEPARTMENT THEREFORE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS INDIVIDUALITY HAS ITS PROPER FIELD OF ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IT IS NECESSARY THAT GENERAL RULES SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE OBSERVED
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
AND ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LETTER ANNETTA CRIED AND FESSED UP FREELY SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN A LETTER AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHAT TO SAY
HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
WHERE BARBARA SHAW IN AN AGONY OF DESIRE TO BE USEFUL POURED A PAILFUL OF HALF FROZEN WATER OVER PRILLIE'S FACE AND SHOULDERS BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HER IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE QUIET WAS RESTORED
EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
HE LETS IT SLEEP ON HIS ROCKING CHARE AND MY AUNT SAYS HE THINKS MORE OF IT THAN HE DOES OF HIS CHILDREN THAT IS NOT RIGHT WE OUGHT TO BE KIND TO CATS AND GIVE THEM NEW MILK BUT WE OUGHT NOT BE BETTER TO THEM THAN TO OUR CHILDREN
BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY
I KISS YOUR HANDS AND FACE MY SWEET MAY GOD WATCH OVER YOU AND PROTECT YOU FROM ALL HARM YOUR AFECKSIONATE PUPIL ANNETTA BELL THIS EXTRAORDINARY LETTER PUZZLED ME NOT A LITTLE
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME ANNE I'VE GOT A HABIT OF BEING OUTSPOKEN AND FOLKS MUSTN'T MIND IT BUT THEY CAN'T HELP MINDING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP THAT IT'S YOUR HABIT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A PERSON WHO WENT ABOUT STICKING PINS AND NEEDLES INTO PEOPLE AND SAYING
HANNAH BELL WANTED TO BE GOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT MARJORY WHITE AGED TEN WANTED TO BE A WIDOW QUESTIONED WHY SHE GRAVELY SAID THAT IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED PEOPLE CALLED YOU AN OLD MAID AND IF YOU WERE YOUR HUSBAND BOSSED YOU
AND PIPING A QUAINT LITTLE MELODY AMONG THE TWISTED FIRS BELOW THE GARDEN TURNED HER DREAMY FACE OVER HER SHOULDER THE TROUBLE IS YOU AND MISSUS LYNDE DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER SHE EXPLAINED THAT IS ALWAYS WHAT IS WRONG WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
AND I MEAN TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM I HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THEM EXCEPT GRANDMA AND FATHER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS SO THERE IS NO USE IN TELLING THEM
DID YOU KNOW THAT THOMAS A BECKET WAS CANONIZED AS A SNAKE ROSE BELL SAYS HE WAS ALSO THAT WILLIAM TYNDALE WROTE THE NEW TESTAMENT CLAUDE WHITE SAYS A GLACIER IS A MAN WHO PUTS IN WINDOW FRAMES
HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
I PUT TEACHER WHERE HE PUT LADY AND I PUT IN SOMETHING OF MY OWN WHEN I COULD THINK OF IT AND I CHANGED SOME WORDS I PUT DRESS IN PLACE OF MOOD
THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
HE IS OLL STRIPED AND HE GOT ONE OF HIS EARS FROZ OF LAST WINTER ONLY FOR THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD LOOKING CAT MY UNKLE HAS ADOPTED A CAT IT COME TO HIS HOUSE ONE DAY AND WOUDENT GO AWAY AND UNKLE SAYS IT HAS FORGOT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE EVER KNOWED
OR SOME INTERESTING THING OR PERSON THEY HAD SEEN THEY WERE TO WRITE THE LETTERS ON REAL NOTE PAPER SEAL THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESS THEM TO ME ALL WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE LAST FRIDAY MORNING I FOUND A PILE OF LETTERS ON MY DESK AND THAT EVENING I REALIZED AFRESH
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
THE OLDEST TWIN CAME SAILING OVER THE SEA IN AN ENCHANTED BOAT AND I GOT IN HER THE BOAT WAS ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWY LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE MUSSEL SHELLS AND HER SAIL WAS LIKE MOONSHINE WELL WE SAILED RIGHT ACROSS TO THE SUNSET
ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
HE HAD SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN THE MOON BUT IT WOULD MAKE THIS LETTER TOO LONG TO TELL THEM THEN THERE IS THE GOLDEN LADY OF THE CAVE ONE DAY I FOUND A BIG CAVE DOWN ON THE SHORE AND I WENT AWAY IN AND AFTER A WHILE I FOUND THE GOLDEN LADY
EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
SAINT CLAIR SAYS HE CAN HIT THE HARDEST BUT PAUL CAN HIT THE OFTENEST PAUL'S LETTER MY DEAR TEACHER YOU TOLD US WE MIGHT WRITE YOU ABOUT SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE WE KNEW I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MY ROCK PEOPLE
ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
SHE HAS GOLDEN HAIR RIGHT DOWN TO HER FEET AND HER DRESS IS ALL GLITTERING AND GLISTENING LIKE GOLD THAT IS ALIVE AND SHE HAS A GOLDEN HARP AND PLAYS ON IT ALL DAY LONG YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC ANY TIME ALONG SHORE IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY
ELIZA BELL HAD SET FIRE TO HER AUNT'S CARDED ROLLS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO DO IT SHE SAID NOT ALTOGETHER
ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
I OWE THIS ALL TO YOU MY SWEETEST TEACHER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HOW SWEET YOU LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU IN THAT BLACK DRESS WITH FLOWERS IN YOUR HAIR I SHALL SEE YOU LIKE THAT FOR EVER EVEN WHEN WE ARE BOTH OLD AND GRAY YOU WILL ALWAYS BE YOUNG AND FAIR TO ME DEAREST TEACHER

MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
WHEN I WAS HELPING AUNT MARY WITH THE DINNER DISHES I DROPPED A CHINA PLATE AND IT SMASHED THAT EVENING I FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE AND HAD TO STAY IN BED FOR A WEEK I HEARD AUNT MARY TELL UNCLE JOSEPH IT WAS A MERCY OR I'D HAVE BROKEN EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE
TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT
A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
ANTHONY PYE STRUTTED TO HIS WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTINENT SWAGGER AND SHE SAW HIM WHISPER SOMETHING TO HIS SEAT MATE AND THEN GLANCE AT HER WITH A GRIN NEVER SO IT SEEMED TO ANNE HAD THERE BEEN SO MANY SQUEAKY PENCILS AS THERE WERE THAT MORNING
AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
HE'S PECULIAR ENOUGH ALL RIGHT THEN SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY
SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
IT HAS SIX WINDOWS AND A CHIMNEY IT HAS TWO ENDS AND TWO SIDES IT IS PAINTED BLUE THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT STRANGE IT IS BUILT ON THE LOWER CARMODY ROAD IT IS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING IN AVONLEA THE OTHERS ARE THE CHURCH AND THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
THEIR MONEY HAD GONE TO PAINT THE HALL AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY FELT THEMSELVES BITTERLY AGGRIEVED BY THE MISTAKE PUBLIC INDIGNATION CENTERED ON THE PYES ROGER PYE AND JOHN ANDREW HAD BUNGLED THE MATTER BETWEEN THEM
BUT I CAN'T HELP LOVING PAUL IRVING THE BEST OF ALL MINE I DON'T THINK IT DOES ANY HARM THOUGH FOR EVERYBODY LOVES PAUL EVEN MISSUS LYNDE WHO SAYS SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED SHE'D GET SO FOND OF A YANKEE THE OTHER BOYS IN SCHOOL LIKE HIM TOO
CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
NORA WAS THE FIRST ONE OF THEM I GOT ACQUAINTED WITH AND SO I THINK I LOVE HER THE BEST SHE LIVES IN ANDREWS COVE AND SHE HAS BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES AND SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE MERMAIDS AND THE WATER KELPIES YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THE STORIES SHE CAN TELL
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
AND THERE THE MATTER STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT NIGHT THERE WAS BLANK DISMAY IN EVERY AVONLEA HOUSE WHERE AN IMPROVER LIVED THE GLOOM AT GREEN GABLES WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT QUENCHED EVEN DAVY ANNE WEPT AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED
PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
YOU LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I THINK PAUL IS A GENIUS BUT I AM SURE HIS LETTER WILL CONVINCE YOU THAT HE IS A VERY UNCOMMON CHILD PAUL LIVES AWAY DOWN NEAR THE SHORE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER AND HE HAS NO PLAYMATES NO REAL PLAYMATES
SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY VERY BRAVE AUNT SHE LIVES IN ONTARIO AND ONE DAY SHE WENT OUT TO THE BARN AND SAW A DOG IN THE YARD THE DOG HAD NO BUSINESS THERE SO SHE GOT A STICK AND WHACKED HIM HARD AND DROVE HIM INTO THE BARN AND SHUT HIM UP PRETTY SOON A MAN CAME LOOKING FOR AN INAGINARY LION
WHEN I GOT BETTER IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME I DON'T LIKE VISITING VERY MUCH I LIKE GOING TO SCHOOL BETTER ESPECIALLY SINCE I CAME TO AVONLEA YOURS RESPECTFULLY BARBARA SHAW WILLIE WHITE'S BEGAN RESPECTED MISS
I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
THE MAIN QUESTION IS WILL THIS JOSHUA DO HIS WORK WELL IF HE DOES I DON'T SEE THAT IT MATTERS WHETHER HIS NAME IS PYE OR PUDDING HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING A GOOD WORKMAN THOUGH THEY SAY HE'S A VERY PECULIAR MAN HE HARDLY EVER TALKS
BECAUSE I'D PROMISED GRANDMOTHER I'D NEVER ASSOCIATE WITH ANYBODY THAT SWORE HE WAS PRETTY WELL SCARED I CAN TELL YOU AND HE SAID IF I WOULD FORGIVE HIM HE WOULD TAKE ME TO THE SUNSET SO THE NEXT EVENING WHEN I WAS SITTING ON THE STRIPED ROCKS
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY THE WIND AMONG THE ROCKS I'VE NEVER TOLD NORA ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS IT EVEN HURT HER FEELINGS IF I TALKED TOO LONG WITH THE TWIN SAILORS I ALWAYS MET THE TWIN SAILORS AT THE STRIPED ROCKS
BUT SHE WAS VERY BRAVE EMERSON GILLIS SAYS IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A DOG SHE WASN'T ANY BRAVER THAN IF IT REALLY WAS A DOG BUT EMERSON IS JEALOUS BECAUSE HE HASN'T GOT A BRAVE AUNT HIMSELF NOTHING BUT UNCLES I HAVE KEPT THE BEST FOR THE LAST
JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
WHEN WE GOT UP I STEPPED ON HER DRESS AND ALL THE GATHERS TORE OUT OF THE SKIRT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I HIT THE PITCHER AGAINST THE BASIN AND CRACKED THEM BOTH AND I UPSET A CUP OF TEA ON THE TABLECLOTH AT BREAKFAST
THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU
WHEN YOU HAD NOT COME INTO MY LIFE TO BLESS AND HALLOW IT I WILL ALWAYS LOOK BACK TO THIS YEAR AS THE MOST WONDERFUL IN MY LIFE BECAUSE IT BROUGHT YOU TO ME BESIDES IT'S THE YEAR WE MOVED TO AVONLEA FROM NEWBRIDGE MY LOVE FOR YOU HAS MADE MY LIFE VERY RICH
THERE IS NOTHING WEAK OR GIRLISH ABOUT HIM IN SPITE OF HIS DREAMS AND FANCIES HE IS VERY MANLY AND CAN HOLD HIS OWN IN ALL GAMES HE FOUGHT SAINT CLAIR DONNELL RECENTLY BECAUSE SAINT CLAIR SAID THE UNION JACK WAS AWAY AHEAD OF THE STARS AND STRIPES AS A FLAG
BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED
AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
THEN THERE ARE THE TWIN SAILORS THEY DON'T LIVE ANYWHERE THEY SAIL ALL THE TIME BUT THEY OFTEN COME ASHORE TO TALK TO ME THEY ARE A PAIR OF JOLLY TARS AND THEY HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND MORE THAN WHAT IS IN THE WORLD
I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND MIND WITH ALL THERE IS OF ME TO LOVE AND I WANT TO SERVE YOU FOR EVER IT WOULD BE MY HIGHEST PRIVILEGE THAT IS WHY I TRY SO HARD TO BE GOOD IN SCHOOL AND LEARN MY LESSUNS YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL MY TEACHER
IT IS JUST THAT HE HAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TACT OR IMAGINATION DEAR MISS SHIRLEY YOU TOLD US TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING STRANGE WE HAVE SEEN I WILL DESCRIBE THE AVONLEA HALL IT HAS TWO DOORS AN INSIDE ONE AND AN OUTSIDE ONE
AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
HERE IS BARBARA SHAW'S LETTER I CAN'T REPRODUCE THE BLOTS OF THE ORIGINAL DEAR TEACHER YOU SAID WE MIGHT WRITE ABOUT A VISIT I NEVER VISITED BUT ONCE IT WAS AT MY AUNT MARY'S LAST WINTER
AND HERS ARE GENERALLY AS BRIEF AS SAINT CLAIR'S ANNETTA IS A QUIET LITTLE PUSS AND A MODEL OF GOOD BEHAVIOR BUT THERE ISN'T A SHADOW OF ORGINALITY IN HER HERE IS HER LETTER DEAREST TEACHER I THINK I WILL WRITE YOU A LETTER TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU
KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
MY AUNT MARY IS A VERY PARTICULAR WOMAN AND A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS THERE WE WERE AT TEA I KNOCKED OVER A JUG AND BROKE IT AUNT MARY SAID SHE HAD HAD THAT JUG EVER SINCE SHE WAS MARRIED AND NOBODY HAD EVER BROKEN IT BEFORE
DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WANTED TO LIVE TIBBY DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DID KNOW DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HE WAS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN BUT WHEN PRESSED REMARKED THAT HE SHOULD PREFER TO BE QUITE FREE OF ANY PROFESSION
FLATTERED AND FINESSED INTO AN AFFECTION FOR HER WHICH ALLOWING LEISURE FOR THE CONQUEST OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MOTHER FOR HIS ABJURING ALL FUTURE ATTACHMENTS AND DETESTING THE SEX MIGHT BE REASONABLY LOOKED FOR IN THE COURSE OF A TWELVEMONTH
AND MONTH BY MONTH THE ROADS SMELT MORE STRONGLY OF PETROL AND WERE MORE DIFFICULT TO CROSS AND HUMAN BEINGS HEARD EACH OTHER SPEAK WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY BREATHED LESS OF THE AIR AND SAW LESS OF THE SKY NATURE WITHDREW
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW SHE KEPT REPEATING NOT UNCIVILLY BUT WITH EXTREME GLOOM
CERTAINLY LONDON FASCINATES ONE VISUALIZES IT AS A TRACT OF QUIVERING GREY INTELLIGENT WITHOUT PURPOSE AND EXCITABLE WITHOUT LOVE AS A SPIRIT THAT HAS ALTERED BEFORE IT CAN BE CHRONICLED
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING BY MIDSUMMER THE SUN SHONE THROUGH DIRT WITH AN ADMIRED OBSCURITY TO SPEAK AGAINST LONDON IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE THE EARTH AS AN ARTISTIC CULT HAS HAD ITS DAY
WAS VERY READY TO OBLIGE THE WHOLE PARTY BY CONSENTING TO A PROLONGATION OF HER STAY AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO MONTHS CEASED TO WRITE OF HER ABSENCE AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR MORE TO WRITE TO HER AT ALL
AND HER PLEASURE IN THEIR SOCIETY FREDERICA WAS NO MORE ALTERED THAN LADY SUSAN THE SAME RESTRAINED MANNERS THE SAME TIMID LOOK IN THE PRESENCE OF HER MOTHER AS HERETOFORE ASSURED HER AUNT OF HER SITUATION BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
ACKNOWLEDGING IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL DELIGHT THAT FREDERICA WAS NOW GROWING EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE WHAT A PARENT COULD DESIRE MISSUS VERNON SURPRIZED AND INCREDULOUS KNEW NOT WHAT TO SUSPECT
WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
MAKING NO MORE OF BOXER THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A HOUSE LAMB THE CARRIER AND HIS WIFE EXCHANGED A LOOK OF PERPLEXITY THE STRANGER RAISED HIS HEAD AND GLANCING FROM THE LATTER TO THE FORMER SAID YOUR DAUGHTER MY GOOD FRIEND
THEN WITH A NEWBORN EMOTION THEY SHOOK HANDS THE CONVERSATION CEASED SUDDENLY WHEN MARGARET RE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TALKING OVER HER NEW FRIEND AND HAD DISMISSED HER AS
THE CARRIER PUT HIS HAND INTO A POCKET OF THE COAT HE HAD TAKEN OFF AND BROUGHT OUT CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN MOSS AND PAPER A TINY FLOWER POT THERE IT IS HE SAID ADJUSTING IT WITH GREAT CARE
WICKHAM PLACE HAD BEEN SO SAFE SHE FEARED FANTASTICALLY THAT HER OWN LITTLE FLOCK MIGHT BE MOVING INTO TURMOIL AND SQUALOR
IT'S A BOX OF DOLLS EYES FOR MY DAUGHTERS WORK
WHAT IT IS HE SNEERED WHAT IT IS WORSE LUCK I WANT ACTIVITY WITHOUT CIVILIZATION HOW PARADOXICAL YET I EXPECT THAT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN HEAVEN AND I SAID TIBBY
I WISH IT WAS OR COULD BE CRIED THE CARRIER THANKEE SAID THE LITTLE MAN YOU SPEAK VERY HEARTY TO THINK THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE THE DOLLS AND THEM A STARING AT HER SO BOLD ALL DAY LONG
AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
MAKING MONEY A SPHERE AWAITING YOU AND SO ON ALL OF WHICH ARE FOR VARIOUS REASONS CANT SHE SEWED ON I'M ONLY YOUR SISTER I HAVEN'T ANY AUTHORITY OVER YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY JUST TO PUT BEFORE YOU
ROUSE UP THAT'S MY HEARTY JOHN SAID THESE LATTER WORDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHITHER HE HAD HURRIED WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND MISS SLOWBOY CONSCIOUS OF SOME MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND CONNECTING IN HER MYSTIFIED IMAGINATION
AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF POLITE BEWILDERMENT HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE HER KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURE SLIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEW ENGLISH ART CLUB
MARGARET WAS NOT SHOCKED BUT WENT ON SEWING FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE REPLIED
CALEB PLUMMER WITH CARE YES
MADE HER ALMOST TURN FROM HER WITH HORROR NO REMEMBRANCE OF REGINALD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT GAVE ONE LOOK OF EMBARRASSMENT
WIFE RETURNED JOHN NIECE SAID THE STRANGER WIFE ROARED JOHN INDEED OBSERVED THE STRANGER SURELY VERY YOUNG HE QUIETLY TURNED OVER AND RESUMED HIS READING BUT
NEVER MIND THAT IT WOULD BE CHEAP TO ME WHAT EVER IT COST RETURNED THE LITTLE MAN ANYTHING ELSE JOHN A SMALL BOX REPLIED THE CARRIER HERE YOU ARE FOR CALEB PLUMMER
HAD LITTLE TO SAY TO STRANGERS WHO HAD NEVER SHARED IT AND WHOSE AGE WAS HALF HER OWN CLEVER TALK ALARMED HER AND WITHERED HER DELICATE IMAGININGS IT WAS THE SOCIAL COUNTERPART OF A MOTORCAR ALL JERKS
HE RETURNED WITH THE DISTRAUGHT AIR OF A MAN WHO WAS CASTING ABOUT FOR THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AT LEAST PRETTY MUCH SO THERE'S RATHER A RUN ON NOAH'S ARKS AT PRESENT I COULD HAVE WISHED TO IMPROVE ON THE FAMILY BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S TO BE DONE AT THE PRICE
I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
ITS LITERATURE AND ART HAVE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL THE KINK OF THE UNSEEN ABOUT THEM AND THIS PERSISTS EVEN THROUGH DECADENCE AND AFFECTATION
NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
ABOVE ALL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD SHE MOST DREADED THE INFLUENZA FOR HER DAUGHTER'S CONSTITUTION FREDERICA RETURNED TO CHURCHHILL WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS LADY SUSAN ANNOUNCED HER BEING MARRIED TO SIR JAMES MARTIN
SAID MARGARET A LITTLE SADLY THEY ARE TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME I CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE MEN AN EMPIRE BORES ME SO FAR BUT I CAN APPRECIATE THE HEROISM THAT BUILDS IT UP LONDON BORES ME BUT WHAT THOUSANDS OF SPLENDID PEOPLE ARE LABOURING TO MAKE LONDON
AND WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HER OWN VIEWS ONLY FEARED GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMPLISHING THEM THE FIRST HOPE OF ANYTHING BETTER WAS DERIVED FROM LADY SUSAN'S ASKING HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT FREDERICA LOOKED QUITE
IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
AND MARGARET'S EYES WERE NOT OPENED UNTIL THE LEASE OF WICKHAM PLACE EXPIRED SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IT MUST EXPIRE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY BECAME VIVID ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT
CHAPTER NINE MISSUS WILCOX CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF GIVING MARGARET MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT LIFE AND MARGARET ON THE OTHER HAND HAS MADE A FAIR SHOW OF MODESTY AND HAS PRETENDED TO AN INEXPERIENCE
HAS VERY LITTLE FAITH IN THE CONTINENT AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE ALL TAKEN AFTER HIM ON WHAT GROUNDS DO THEY FEEL THAT THE CONTINENT IS IN BAD FORM MISSUS WILCOX HAD NO IDEA SHE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO GROUNDS
WAS DEFRAUDED OF HER DUE BY A WOMAN TEN YEARS OLDER
AND HE STILL ATTENDED ON HIM VERY CLOSELY WORRYING HIS GAITERS IN FACT AND MAKING DEAD SETS AT THE BUTTONS YOU'RE SUCH AN UNDENIABLY GOOD SLEEPER SIR SAID JOHN WHEN TRANQUILLITY WAS RESTORED
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
FOR WHEN HE TURNED TO SHUT THE DOOR AND KEEP THE WEATHER OUT HE DISCLOSED UPON THE BACK OF THAT GARMENT THE INSCRIPTION G AND T IN LARGE BLACK CAPITALS ALSO THE WORD GLASS IN BOLD CHARACTERS GOOD EVENING JOHN SAID THE LITTLE MAN
OH MISSUS WILCOX YOU WOULD LOVE THE ODER THE RIVER OR RATHER RIVERS THERE SEEM TO BE DOZENS OF THEM ARE INTENSE BLUE AND THE PLAIN THEY RUN THROUGH AN INTENSEST GREEN
MEN HAVE DEVELOPED THE DESIRE FOR WORK AND THEY MUST NOT STARVE IT IT'S A NEW DESIRE IT GOES WITH A GREAT DEAL THAT'S BAD BUT IN ITSELF IT'S GOOD AND I HOPE THAT FOR WOMEN TOO NOT TO WORK WILL SOON BECOME AS SHOCKING AS
RETORTED HELEN AND THAT TOPIC WAS RESUMED BUT WITH ACRIMONY THEN TEA CAME AND AFTER TEA HELEN WENT ON PREPARING HER SPEECH AND MARGARET PREPARED ONE TOO FOR THEY WERE GOING OUT TO A DISCUSSION SOCIETY ON THE MORROW
NOT SO MUCH AS A LEAF DAMAGED FULL OF BUDS CALEB'S DULL EYE BRIGHTENED AS HE TOOK IT AND THANKED HIM DEAR CALEB SAID THE CARRIER VERY DEAR AT THIS SEASON
SHE INSTINCTIVELY MADE A CHARGE OR BUTT AT HIM WITH THE ONLY OFFENSIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN HER REACH THIS INSTRUMENT HAPPENING TO BE THE BABY GREAT COMMOTION AND ALARM ENSUED WHICH THE SAGACITY OF BOXER RATHER TENDED TO INCREASE
VERY NEARLY REMEMBERED HIM TWICE SINCE I CAME IN BUT HE WENT OUT OF MY HEAD AGAIN
OVER TWO YEARS PASSED AND THE SCHLEGEL HOUSEHOLD CONTINUED TO LEAD ITS LIFE OF CULTURED BUT NOT IGNOBLE EASE STILL SWIMMING GRACEFULLY ON THE GREY TIDES OF LONDON
TIME SUFFERED NO INCONVENIENCE BUT ALL NIGHT AND ALL THIS MORNING HER APPREHENSIONS GREW BREAKFAST DIDN'T SEEM THE SAME NO NO MORE DID LUNCH AND SO SHE STROLLED UP TO TWO WICKHAM PLACE AS BEING THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR THE MISSING
LADY SUSAN WAS UNABLE TO EXPRESS HER SENSE OF SUCH KINDNESS YET KNEW NOT FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS HOW TO PART WITH HER DAUGHTER AND AS THOUGH HER OWN PLANS WERE NOT YET WHOLLY FIXED
IN THE MEANTIME THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD STOOD BAREHEADED AND MOTIONLESS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
AND DARK BRIGHT PENETRATING EYES LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE AND SALUTED THE CARRIER'S WIFE BY GRAVELY INCLINING HIS HEAD HIS GARB WAS VERY QUAINT AND ODD A LONG LONG WAY BEHIND THE TIME ITS HUE WAS BROWN ALL OVER
SIR JAMES MAY SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN A HARDER LOT THAN MERE FOLLY MERITED I LEAVE HIM THEREFORE TO ALL THE PITY THAT ANYBODY CAN GIVE HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I CAN PITY ONLY MISS MAINWARING WHO
I AM NOT SURE THAT I AGREE DO YOU SAID HE TURNING TO MISSUS WILCOX SHE REPLIED I THINK MISS SCHLEGEL PUTS EVERYTHING SPLENDIDLY
SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
THAT SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT FEEL SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE FOR OVER TEN YEARS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ALMOST WITH DISTINCTION SHE HAD BROUGHT UP A CHARMING SISTER AND WAS BRINGING UP A BROTHER SURELY IF EXPERIENCE IS ATTAINABLE SHE HAD ATTAINED IT
BEFORE HE COULD HAVE READ TWO LINES HE AGAIN INTERRUPTED HIMSELF TO SAY BABY YOURS
WHILE HER SHALLOWS WASHED MORE WIDELY AGAINST THE HILLS OF SURREY AND OVER THE FIELDS OF HERTFORDSHIRE THIS FAMOUS BUILDING HAD ARISEN THAT WAS DOOMED TODAY WHITEHALL HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED IT WOULD BE THE TURN OF REGENT STREET TOMORROW
VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO ONE'S MIND TO MAKE IT CLEARER WHICH WAS SHEMS AND HAMS AND WHICH WAS WIVES FLIES AN'T ON THAT SCALE NEITHER AS COMPARED WITH ELEPHANTS YOU KNOW AH WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING IN THE PARCEL LINE FOR ME JOHN
AND FINALLY DISMISSED HIM AS HAVING NO POSSIBLE BEARING ON THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION THAT BLEAT OF TIBBY'S INFURIATED HELEN BUT HELEN WAS NOW DOWN IN THE DINING ROOM PREPARING A SPEECH ABOUT POLITICAL ECONOMY AT TIMES HER VOICE COULD BE HEARD DECLAIMING THROUGH THE FLOOR
WAS SHE PRETTY HER FIGURE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD ONCE THE FLATS THEIR ONLY OUTLOOK HUNG LIKE AN ORNATE CURTAIN BETWEEN MARGARET AND THE WELTER OF LONDON HER THOUGHTS TURNED SADLY TO HOUSE HUNTING
A CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER SISTER IN LAW'S CONSENT TO IT HER ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT MADE HER PRESS FOR AN EARLY VISIT TO LONDON AND MISTER VERNON WHO AS IT MUST ALREADY HAVE APPEARED LIVED ONLY TO DO WHATEVER HE WAS DESIRED
A DESCRIPTION WHICH WILL EQUALLY APPLY TO HIS VOICE OR AT JOHN FOR ANOTHER SAID CALEB OR AT TILLY AS FAR AS THAT GOES OR CERTAINLY AT BOXER BUSY JUST NOW CALEB ASKED THE CARRIER WHY PRETTY WELL JOHN
AND NOT TILL THE MEAL WAS HALF OVER DID THEY REALIZE THAT THE PRINCIPAL GUEST HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CHASE THERE WAS NO COMMON TOPIC MISSUS WILCOX WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE SERVICE OF HUSBAND AND SONS
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
CONCLUSION THIS CORRESPONDENCE BY A MEETING BETWEEN SOME OF THE PARTIES AND A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE OTHERS COULD NOT TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE POST OFFICE REVENUE BE CONTINUED ANY LONGER
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MUST BE GETTING BACK TO MY OVERHANGING WAREHOUSE SAID THE MAN THEY'VE TURNED DISGRACEFULLY STRICT
YOUR LAST SPEECH INTERESTED ME SO MUCH GENERALLY PEOPLE DO NOT
WORK WORK WORK IF YOU'D SAVE YOUR SOUL AND YOUR BODY IT IS HONESTLY A NECESSITY DEAR BOY LOOK AT THE WILCOXES LOOK AT MISTER PEMBROKE WITH ALL THEIR DEFECTS OF TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING
FOR WHO WOULD TAKE HER ASSURANCE OF IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION THE WORLD MUST JUDGE FROM PROBABILITIES SHE HAD NOTHING AGAINST HER BUT HER HUSBAND AND HER CONSCIENCE
SAID TIBBY FAINTLY AND LEANT SO FAR BACK IN HIS CHAIR THAT HE EXTENDED IN A HORIZONTAL LINE FROM KNEES TO THROAT AND DON'T THINK I'M NOT SERIOUS BECAUSE I DON'T USE THE TRADITIONAL ARGUMENTS
ONLY THAT WOULD BE A JOKE AND I KNOW I SHOULD SPOIL IT VERY NEAR THOUGH MURMURED THE CARRIER WITH A CHUCKLE VERY NEAR THE STRANGER
AND STAMPED WITH A HUMAN FACE LONDON IS RELIGION'S OPPORTUNITY NOT THE DECOROUS RELIGION OF THEOLOGIANS BUT ANTHROPOMORPHIC CRUDE YES THE CONTINUOUS FLOW WOULD BE TOLERABLE IF A MAN OF OUR OWN SORT
MURMURED MARGARET PUTTING DOWN HER WORK I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS SO FUNNY HELEN IT MEANS SOME HORRIBLE VOLCANO SMOKING SOMEWHERE DOESN'T IT
AND CONFIRMED HER IN THE PLAN OF ALTERING IT NO UNKINDNESS HOWEVER ON THE PART OF LADY SUSAN APPEARED PERSECUTION ON THE SUBJECT OF SIR JAMES WAS ENTIRELY AT AN END HIS NAME MERELY MENTIONED TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT IN LONDON
AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
SAID THE LITTLE MAN SPELLING OUT THE DIRECTION WITH CASH WITH CASH JOHN I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ME WITH CARE RETURNED THE CARRIER LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER WHERE DO YOU MAKE OUT CASH
LET ME SEE I THINK THAT'S ALL I THINK NOT SAID THE CARRIER TRY AGAIN
OUT TO HIS DUTY DUTY ALWAYS ELICITED A GROAN HE DOESN'T WANT THE MONEY IT IS WORK HE WANTS THOUGH IT IS BEASTLY WORK DULL COUNTRY DISHONEST NATIVES AN ETERNAL FIDGET OVER FRESH WATER AND FOOD
IT HAD SEEN SO MUCH HAPPINESS WHY HAD IT TO BE SWEPT AWAY IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY SHE NOTED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ARCHITECTURE OF HURRY AND HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF HURRY ON THE MOUTHS OF ITS INHABITANTS
WANT CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ACTIVITY WHICH I EXPECT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN THE OTHER PLACE
FOR THAT GOOD DOG MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN HIS MASTER HAD IT SEEMED BEEN WATCHING THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS SLEEP LEST HE SHOULD WALK OFF WITH A FEW YOUNG POPLAR TREES THAT WERE TIED UP BEHIND THE CART
THAT'S WHERE IT CUTS WHAT'S THE DAMAGE JOHN I'LL DAMAGE YOU SAID JOHN IF YOU INQUIRE DOT VERY NEAR WELL IT'S LIKE YOU TO SAY SO OBSERVED THE LITTLE MAN IT'S YOUR KIND WAY
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF ALL THE TROUBLE OF URGING A REMOVAL WHICH LADY SUSAN HAD DOUBTLESS RESOLVED ON FROM THE FIRST FREDERICA'S VISIT WAS NOMINALLY FOR SIX WEEKS BUT HER MOTHER THOUGH INVITING HER TO RETURN IN ONE OR TWO AFFECTIONATE LETTERS
NICER THAN WOMEN LABOURING UNDER SUCH A DELUSION WHY DO YOU NOT MARRY I SOMETIMES JOLLY WELL THINK I WOULD IF I GOT THE CHANCE HAS NOBODY ARST YOU ONLY NINNIES DO PEOPLE ASK HELEN PLENTIFULLY TELL ME ABOUT THEM
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
OH TO BE SURE SAID CALEB IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH CARE YES YES THAT'S MINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH CASH INDEED IF MY DEAR BOY IN THE GOLDEN SOUTH AMERICAS HAD LIVED JOHN YOU LOVED HIM LIKE A SON DIDN'T YOU
YET SHE AND DAILY LIFE WERE OUT OF FOCUS ONE OR THE OTHER MUST SHOW BLURRED AND AT LUNCH SHE SEEMED MORE OUT OF FOCUS THAN USUAL AND NEARER THE LINE THAT DIVIDES LIFE FROM A LIFE THAT MAY BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTED ME UP TO THE LAST BAGS I WRITING TO AUNT JULEY ABOUT THIS NOW MEG REMEMBER BAGS I BAG IT BY ALL MEANS
SAID CALEB AFTER PONDERING A LITTLE WHILE TO BE SURE THAT'S WHAT I CAME FOR BUT MY HEAD'S SO RUNNING ON THEM ARKS AND THINGS HE HASN'T BEEN HERE HAS HE NOT HE RETURNED THE CARRIER HE'S TOO BUSY COURTING
SHE HAD A FACE LIKE A SILKWORM AND THE DINING ROOM REEKS OF ORRIS ROOT WE CHATTED PLEASANTLY A LITTLE ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I WONDERED WHERE HERS WAS TOO AND ADVISED HER TO GO TO THE POLICE SHE THANKED ME
HER HUSBAND MAY BE THOUGH SAID MARGARET MOVING TO THE WINDOW
WHAT I THINK THE TRUTH YOU SEE
CERTAIN ASSOCIATIONS OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE WITH THE PHRASE WAS SO DISTURBED THAT HASTILY RISING FROM THE LOW CHAIR BY THE FIRE TO SEEK PROTECTION NEAR THE SKIRT OF HER MISTRESS AND COMING INTO CONTACT AS SHE CROSSED THE DOORWAY WITH AN ANCIENT STRANGER
NOT TO BE MARRIED WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF THIS PROFOUND DESIRE TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE ENUNCIATED TIBBY
OR OFTEN HAVING LEARNT ENOUGH IN THE MEANWHILE FROM HER OPEN HEARTED BROTHER OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND LADY SUSAN TO SINK THE LATTER LOWER THAN EVER IN HER OPINION
NOR IN THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN JOURNALISM AND LITERATURE WHICH WAS STARTED AS A CONVERSATIONAL HARE THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE DARTED AFTER IT WITH CRIES OF JOY MARGARET LEADING THEM
AND AM NOT PRETENDING
HER HOSTESS WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN PLACING ROTHENSTEIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS REPEATED I HOPE THAT YOUR SISTER IS SAFE IN GERMANY BY NOW MARGARET CHECKED HERSELF AND SAID YES THANK YOU I HEARD ON TUESDAY
SOMEWHAT LESS FORMIDABLE THE LUCKY ALARM OF AN INFLUENZA DECIDED WHAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED QUITE SO SOON LADY SUSAN'S MATERNAL FEARS WERE THEN TOO MUCH AWAKENED FOR HER TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT FREDERICA'S REMOVAL FROM THE RISK OF INFECTION
AND DWARFED THEIR ACTIVITIES THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN MISSUS WILCOX THERE WAS NOT EVEN CRITICISM SHE WAS LOVABLE AND NO UNGRACIOUS OR UNCHARITABLE WORD HAD PASSED HER LIPS
PEOPLE WILL THERE DISCUSS WITH HUMILITY VITAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HERE THINK OURSELVES TOO GOOD TO TOUCH WITH TONGS I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO PRUSSIAN SAID MISSUS WILCOX NOT EVEN TO SEE THAT INTERESTING VIEW THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING
A NATION WHO CAN PRODUCE MEN OF THAT SORT MAY WELL BE PROUD NO WONDER ENGLAND HAS BECOME AN EMPIRE EMPIRE I CAN'T
GOOD EVENING TILLY GOOD EVENING UNBEKNOWN HOW'S BABY MUM BOXER'S PRETTY WELL I HOPE ALL THRIVING CALEB REPLIED DOT
CONCERTS AND PLAYS SWEPT PAST THEM MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT AND RENEWED REPUTATIONS WON AND LOST AND THE CITY HERSELF EMBLEMATIC OF THEIR LIVES ROSE AND FELL IN A CONTINUAL FLUX
BUT THE DEMON OF VOCIFERATION WAS IN HER AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS OFF AGAIN ONLY ON TUESDAY FOR THEY LIVE RIGHT AWAY AT STETTIN
I NEVER FOLLOW ANY ARGUMENTS I AM ONLY TOO THANKFUL NOT TO HAVE A VOTE MYSELF
THE PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNED THE FREEHOLD OF WICKHAM PLACE AND DESIRED TO ERECT BABYLONIAN FLATS UPON IT WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO STIR SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE QUIVERING JELLY HE WAS NOT A FOOL
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
INDEED THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MOST BEAUTIFUL VIEW MISS SCHLEGEL SO I SAY BUT HELEN WHO WILL MUDDLE THINGS SAYS NO IT'S LIKE MUSIC
FOR ANOTHER YOU YOUNGER PEOPLE MOVE SO QUICKLY THAT IT DAZES ME CHARLES IS THE SAME DOLLY THE SAME BUT WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT OLD AND YOUNG I NEVER FORGET THAT THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT
THEN THERE'S GUY THAT WAS A PITIFUL BUSINESS BESIDES SHIFTING TO THE GENERAL EVERY ONE IS THE BETTER FOR SOME REGULAR WORK GROANS I SHALL STICK TO IT SHE CONTINUED SMILING
AND THE LITERATURE OF THE NEAR FUTURE WILL PROBABLY IGNORE THE COUNTRY AND SEEK INSPIRATION FROM THE TOWN ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE REACTION OF PAN AND THE ELEMENTAL FORCES THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
THAT WAY LIES MADNESS THANK GOODNESS SHE TOO HAD SOME MONEY AND COULD PURCHASE A NEW HOME TIBBY NOW IN HIS SECOND YEAR AT OXFORD WAS DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION AND MARGARET TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING A SERIOUS TALK WITH HIM
SOON FOUND SOME ACCOMMODATING BUSINESS TO CALL HIM THITHER WITH A HEART FULL OF THE MATTER MISSUS VERNON WAITED ON LADY SUSAN SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL IN TOWN AND WAS MET WITH SUCH AN EASY AND CHEERFUL AFFECTION AS
AS A HEART THAT CERTAINLY BEATS BUT WITH NO PULSATION OF HUMANITY IT LIES BEYOND EVERYTHING NATURE WITH ALL HER CRUELTY COMES NEARER TO US THAN DO THESE CROWDS OF MEN
SHE WAS PROPORTIONABLY MORE ANXIOUS TO GET FREDERICA REMOVED FROM SUCH A MOTHER AND PLACED UNDER HER OWN CARE AND THOUGH WITH LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS WAS RESOLVED TO LEAVE NOTHING UNATTEMPTED THAT MIGHT OFFER
THAT'S THE WAY I FOUND HIM SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE UPRIGHT AS A MILESTONE AND ALMOST AS DEAF SITTING IN THE OPEN AIR JOHN IN THE OPEN AIR REPLIED THE CARRIER JUST AT DUSK CARRIAGE PAID HE SAID AND GAVE ME EIGHTEEN PENCE THEN HE GOT IN AND
SHE HAD HEARD HIM EXPOSE SOCIALISM BUT TRUE INSIGHT BEGAN JUST WHERE HIS INTELLIGENCE ENDED AND ONE GATHERED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE WITH MOST MILLIONAIRES WHAT RIGHT HAD SUCH MEN BUT MARGARET CHECKED HERSELF
IF YOU PLEASE I WAS TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR SAID THE STRANGER MILDLY DON'T MIND ME
SIGNING TO THEM TO GO ON AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THE SHADOWS OF HIS FACE WERE DEEPENING AND HIS TIGHT LIPS SEEMED HOLDING IN CHECK THE MOAN OF GREAT DESPAIR THERE COULD BE SEEN A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY
THE TALL SOLDIER WEAKLY TRIED TO WRENCH HIMSELF FREE HUH HE SAID VACANTLY HE STARED AT THE YOUTH FOR A MOMENT AT LAST HE SPOKE AS IF DIMLY COMPREHENDING
SO THEY ROSE UP TO GO BACK AND DHARMU ASKED ABOUT THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD MET AND KARAM GOSAIN SAID THE WOMAN HAS A STOOL STUCK TO HER BACK BECAUSE WHEN VISITORS CAME SHE NEVER OFFERED THEM A SEAT
THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
HE WAS QUICK TO SEE VULNERABLE PLACES IN THEM ALL FURTHERMORE HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THAT SOME ARROW OF SCORN MIGHT LAY HIM MENTALLY LOW BEFORE HE COULD RAISE HIS PROTECTING TALE
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
BALANCING AWKWARDLY ON ONE FOOT HE HAD NO RIFLE HE COULD NOT FIGHT WITH HIS HANDS SAID HE RESENTFULLY TO HIS PLAN WELL RIFLES COULD BE HAD FOR THE PICKING THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARILY PROFUSE
HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
AND THEY ASKED HOW THEY SHOULD PROPITIATE HIM AND THE VOICE SAID GRIND TURMERIC AND PUT IT ON A PLATE AND BUY NEW CLOTH AND DYE IT WITH TURMERIC AND MAKE READY OIL AND TAKE THESE THINGS TO THE GANGES
HE PROTESTED IN A DULLED WAY KEEPING HIS EYES FASTENED ON THE MYSTIC PLACE OF HIS INTENTIONS NO NO DON'T TECH ME LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH AGHAST AND FILLED WITH WONDER AT THE TALL SOLDIER
OF THE OTHER LABOURERS AND THE LABOURERS ALSO TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR HIM TO WORK AS A LABOURER HIMSELF BUT DHARMU SAID
HE WAS NOT CAST DOWN BY THIS DEFEAT OF HIS PLAN FOR UPON STUDYING THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THE OBJECTIONS WERE VERY FORMIDABLE FURTHERMORE VARIOUS AILMENTS HAD BEGUN TO CRY OUT
THE TALL SOLDIER TURNED AND LURCHING DANGEROUSLY WENT ON THE YOUTH AND THE TATTERED SOLDIER FOLLOWED SNEAKING AS IF WHIPPED FEELING UNABLE TO FACE THE STRICKEN MAN IF HE SHOULD AGAIN CONFRONT THEM
HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
PRESENTLY THE LATTER HEARD A VOICE TALKING SOFTLY NEAR HIS SHOULDER TURNING HE SAW THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TATTERED SOLDIER
THEY FELT THE PRIDE OF THEIR ONWARD MOVEMENT WHEN THE REMAINDER OF THE ARMY SEEMED TRYING TO DRIBBLE DOWN THIS ROAD THEY TUMBLED TEAMS ABOUT WITH A FINE FEELING THAT IT WAS NO MATTER SO LONG AS THEIR COLUMN GOT TO THE FRONT IN TIME
THIS IMPORTANCE MADE THEIR FACES GRAVE AND STERN AND THE BACKS OF THE OFFICERS WERE VERY RIGID AS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THEM THE BLACK WEIGHT OF HIS WOE RETURNED TO HIM
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WITH BOTH HER FEET BURNING IN A FIRE AND ANOTHER WITH A STOOL STUCK FAST TO HER BACK AND THEY PROMISED TO ENQUIRE HOW THESE MIGHT BE DELIVERED
HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE ALSO WOULD PERFORM THE CEREMONIES IN HIS HOUSE SO THEY SET TO WORK AND WERE EMPLOYED IN COOKING RICE AND VEGETABLES FAR INTO THE NIGHT
THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
BUT THEY SAID IT IS NO LOW CASTE PERSON BUT DHARMU THEN THEY BATHED HIM AND ANOINTED HIM WITH OIL AND TURMERIC AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE NEW CLOTH WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT AND THUS THEY PERSUADED HIM TO RETURN
AS HE HAD THUS OFFENDED KARAM GOSAIN ALL DHARMU'S UNDERTAKINGS FAILED AND HE FELL INTO DEEP POVERTY AND HAD NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO EAT SO HE HAD TO TAKE SERVICE WITH HIS BROTHER KARMU
KARAM GOSAIN PROMISED THEM THAT ON THEIR WAY BACK THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL AND THEY DID SO AND MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME WITH GREAT WEALTH
LEAVE ME BE THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE WHILE HE WAITED SUDDENLY HIS FORM STIFFENED AND STRAIGHTENED
COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
THE RAVING TEAMSTERS SWORE MANY STRANGE OATHS THE COMMANDS TO MAKE WAY HAD THE RING OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEM THE MEN WERE GOING FORWARD TO THE HEART OF THE DIN THEY WERE TO CONFRONT THE EAGER RUSH OF THE ENEMY
IN HIS EYES THERE WAS A GREAT APPEAL LEAVE ME BE CAN'T YEH LEAVE ME BE FOR A MINNIT THE YOUTH RECOILED WHY JIM HE SAID IN A DAZED WAY WHAT S THE MATTER WITH YOU
AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE WHEN THE MIDDAY MEAL WAS BROUGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
SOMETHING IN THE GESTURE OF THE MAN AS HE WAVED THE BLOODY AND PITYING SOLDIERS AWAY MADE THE YOUTH START AS IF BITTEN HE YELLED IN HORROR TOTTERING FORWARD HE LAID A QUIVERING HAND UPON THE MAN'S ARM
HE MOVED WITH MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE AND ALL OF THE YOUTH'S OFFERS HE BRUSHED ASIDE NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH HAD TO FOLLOW
I M FRAID I LL FALL DOWN AN THEM YEH KNOW THEM DAMNED ARTILLERY WAGONS
AND THEIR ROBES OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WERE SHAMS HOWEVER HE STILL SAID THAT IT WAS A GREAT PITY HE WAS NOT AS THEY A DEFEAT OF THE ARMY HAD SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE
WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM
BUT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER TO PAY THE LABOURERS FIRST AND IN DOING THIS THE PADDY WAS ALL USED UP AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE SO THEY WENT HOME SORROWFULLY AND THEIR CHILDREN CRIED FOR FOOD
THUS MANY MEN OF COURAGE HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DESERT THE COLORS AND SCURRY LIKE CHICKENS HE WOULD APPEAR AS ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD BE SULLEN BROTHERS IN DISTRESS AND HE COULD THEN EASILY BELIEVE
O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU BUT THE COW SAID TO THEM GO TO THE BANKS OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A BUFFALO AND WENT TO MILK IT BUT IT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND CHARGED THEM
AND THEY WENT TO EAT THE FRUIT BUT WHEN THEY GOT NEAR THEY FOUND THAT ALL THE FIGS WERE FULL OF GRUBS AND THEY SANG EXHAUSTED BY HUNGER WE CAME TO A FIG TREE AND FOUND IT FULL OF GRUBS
THEY WERE AWED AND AFRAID THEY HUNG BACK LEST HE HAVE AT COMMAND A DREADFUL WEAPON AT LAST THEY SAW HIM STOP AND STAND MOTIONLESS HASTENING UP THEY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
IF THE MEN WERE ADVANCING THEIR INDIFFERENT FEET WERE TRAMPLING UPON HIS CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AS THESE THOUGHTS WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND HE TURNED UPON THEM AND TRIED TO THRUST THEM AWAY
THERE WAS A DULL WEIGHT LIKE FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AND WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS HEAD SWAYED AND HE TOTTERED HE COULD NOT SEE WITH DISTINCTNESS SMALL PATCHES OF GREEN MIST FLOATED BEFORE HIS VISION
HIS FACE HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF EVERY AGONY HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIS FRIEND HE NOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GOING CLOSER GAZED UPON THE PASTELIKE FACE THE MOUTH WAS OPEN AND THE TEETH
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
AND A HORSE AND A BUFFALO AND A COW AND MONEY AND MANGOES AND FIGS AND DHARMU SAID YES BUT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THE ANIMALS AND THE FRUIT WAS BAD
AND THEY SAW UNDER A BANYAN TREE A LARGE POT FULL OF RUPEES BUT THEY WERE SO DISHEARTENED THAT THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO TOUCH IT THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WHO ASKED WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE SAID
LET HER DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED AND THE WOMAN HAS HER FEET BURNING IN THE FIRE BECAUSE SHE PUSHED THE FUEL INTO THE FIRE WITH HER FOOT LET HER NOT DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
THE YOUTH WISHED HIS FRIEND TO LEAN UPON HIM BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STRANGELY PROTESTED NO NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE HIS LOOK WAS FIXED AGAIN UPON THE UNKNOWN
THEY PAUSED AND STOOD EXPECTANT THERE WAS A SILENCE FINALLY THE CHEST OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER BEGAN TO HEAVE WITH A STRAINED MOTION
BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HIS TIRELESS FATE WOULD BRING FORTH WHEN THE STRIFE LULLED FOR A MOMENT A MAN TO ASK OF HIM AN EXPLANATION
COME LET US UNDO THE WORK WE DID TO DAY YOU CUT DOWN THE EMBANKMENTS YOU REPAIRED AND I WILL UPROOT THE SEEDLINGS WHICH I PLANTED SO THEY WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TO DO THIS BUT WHENEVER DHARMU RAISED HIS SPADE A VOICE CALLED OUT
STANDING BEFORE A CRIMSON AND STEEL ASSAULT GETTING CALMLY KILLED ON A HIGH PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNIFICENT PATHOS OF HIS DEAD BODY THESE THOUGHTS UPLIFTED HIM
AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND IT FELL ON KARAM GOSAIN AND SCALDED HIM AND AS THE FLIES AND INSECTS WORRIED THE WOUND KARAM GOSAIN WENT OFF TO THE GANGES AND BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
HE WAS A CRAVEN LOON THOSE PICTURES OF GLORY WERE PITEOUS THINGS HE GROANED FROM HIS HEART AND WENT STAGGERING OFF A CERTAIN MOTHLIKE QUALITY WITHIN HIM KEPT HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE BATTLE
HE COULD HAVE WEPT IN HIS LONGINGS HE SEARCHED ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR AN ADEQUATE MALEDICTION FOR THE INDEFINITE CAUSE THE THING UPON WHICH MEN TURN THE WORDS OF FINAL BLAME IT
IT INCREASED IN VIOLENCE UNTIL IT WAS AS IF AN ANIMAL WAS WITHIN AND WAS KICKING AND TUMBLING FURIOUSLY TO BE FREE
HOLD HOLD AND WHENEVER HIS WIFE PUT OUT HER HAND TO PULL UP THE RICE A VOICE CALLED OUT HOLD HOLD THEN THEY SAID WHO ARE YOU WHO STOP US AND THE VOICE ANSWERED
IN WRITING REPLIES TO THE SONGS OF HIS ALLEGED FAILURE IT WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE NO DOUBT BUT IN THIS CASE A GENERAL WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE YOUTH IN A DEFEAT
JIM JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT MAKES YOU DO THIS WAY YOU'LL HURT YERSELF THE SAME PURPOSE WAS IN THE TALL SOLDIER'S FACE
HE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FURNACE ROAR OF THE BATTLE WAS GROWING LOUDER GREAT BLOWN CLOUDS HAD FLOATED TO THE STILL HEIGHTS OF AIR BEFORE HIM THE NOISE TOO WAS APPROACHING
AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
HE SEATED HIMSELF AND WATCHED THE TERROR STRICKEN WAGONS THEY FLED LIKE SOFT UNGAINLY ANIMALS ALL THE ROARERS AND LASHERS SERVED TO HELP HIM TO MAGNIFY THE DANGERS AND HORRORS OF THE ENGAGEMENT
THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
THE YOUTH FELL BACK IN THE PROCESSION UNTIL THE TATTERED SOLDIER WAS NOT IN SIGHT THEN HE STARTED TO WALK ON WITH THE OTHERS BUT HE WAS AMID WOUNDS THE MOB OF MEN WAS BLEEDING
THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES AGAIN IN DRAGGING THEIR OWN TRAGEDIES TOWARD THE REAR SUDDENLY AS THE TWO FRIENDS MARCHED ON THE TALL SOLDIER SEEMED TO BE OVERCOME BY A TREMOR HIS FACE TURNED TO A SEMBLANCE OF GRAY PASTE
IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
FROM THE HEAVING TANGLE ISSUED EXHORTATIONS COMMANDS IMPRECATIONS FEAR WAS SWEEPING IT ALL ALONG THE CRACKING WHIPS BIT AND HORSES PLUNGED AND TUGGED
THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
SWIFT PICTURES OF HIMSELF APART YET IN HIMSELF CAME TO HIM A BLUE DESPERATE FIGURE LEADING LURID CHARGES WITH ONE KNEE FORWARD AND A BROKEN BLADE HIGH A BLUE DETERMINED FIGURE
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
HE IMAGINED THE WHOLE REGIMENT SAYING WHERE'S HENRY FLEMING
THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
HE TOLD DHARMU AND HIS WIFE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND COME AND EAT BUT THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT THE HIRED LABOURERS SHOULD BE FED FIRST SO THE LABOURERS ATE AND THEY ATE UP ALL THE RICE
AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
THE YOUTH CRIED OUT TO HIM HYSTERICALLY I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH I SWEAR T GAWD I WILL SURE WILL YEH HENRY THE TALL SOLDIER BESEECHED YES YES I TELL YEH I'LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM PROTESTED THE YOUTH
THERE WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT VINDICATION OF HIMSELF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVE IN A MANNER THAT HE HAD FLED EARLY BECAUSE OF HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF PERCEPTION A SERIOUS PROPHET UPON PREDICTING A FLOOD SHOULD BE THE FIRST MAN TO CLIMB A TREE
AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
WITH SUDDEN LIVID RAGE TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD HE SHOOK HIS FIST HE SEEMED ABOUT TO DELIVER A PHILIPPIC HELL THE RED SUN WAS PASTED IN THE SKY
TO FORCE THEIR WAY TO GRIM CHANCES OF DEATH AS HE WATCHED HIS ENVY GREW UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HE WISHED TO CHANGE LIVES WITH ONE OF THEM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE USED A TREMENDOUS FORCE HE SAID THROW OFF HIMSELF AND BECOME A BETTER
SHOWED IN A LAUGH AS THE FLAP OF THE BLUE JACKET FELL AWAY FROM THE BODY HE COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN CHEWED BY WOLVES THE YOUTH TURNED
HE AND THE TATTERED MAN BEGAN A PURSUIT THERE WAS A SINGULAR RACE
HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE AND TO GET NEWS HE WISHED TO KNOW WHO WAS WINNING HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT DESPITE HIS UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERING HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS GREED FOR A VICTORY
AND IN THE SAME WAY DHARMU'S WIFE MIGHT HAVE ACTED AS OVERSEER OF THE WOMEN BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED NOT TO WORK TOO ONE DAY THEY WERE TRANSPLANTING THE RICE AND KARMU BROUGHT OUT BREAKFAST FOR THE LABOURERS
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
THEN IT BEGAN TO SWING FORWARD SLOW AND STRAIGHT IN THE MANNER OF A FALLING TREE A SWIFT MUSCULAR CONTORTION MADE THE LEFT SHOULDER STRIKE THE GROUND FIRST
I'D DO IT FER YOU WOULDN'T I HENRY HE PAUSED IN PITEOUS ANXIETY TO AWAIT HIS FRIEND'S REPLY THE YOUTH HAD REACHED AN ANGUISH WHERE THE SOBS SCORCHED HIM HE STROVE TO EXPRESS HIS LOYALTY
HE CLUTCHED THE YOUTH'S ARM AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS IF DREADING TO BE OVERHEARD THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SHAKING WHISPER I TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF HENRY I'LL TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF
THE TALL SOLDIER MADE A LITTLE COMMONPLACE SMILE HELLO HENRY HE SAID THE YOUTH SWAYED ON HIS LEGS AND GLARED STRANGELY HE STUTTERED AND STAMMERED OH JIM OH JIM
HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
HE STARTED BLINDLY THROUGH THE GRASS THE YOUTH TURNED ONCE TO LOOK AT THE LASHING RIDERS AND JOUNCING GUNS OF THE BATTERY HE WAS STARTLED FROM THIS VIEW BY A SHRILL OUTCRY FROM THE TATTERED MAN
I GOT SHOT YES B'JIMINEY I GOT SHOT HE REITERATED THIS FACT IN A BEWILDERED WAY AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT CAME ABOUT
KARMU WAS A FARMER AND DHARMU WAS A TRADER ONCE WHEN DHARMU WAS AWAY FROM HOME KARMU GAVE A RELIGIOUS FEAST AND DID NOT INVITE DHARMU'S HOUSEHOLD WHEN DHARMU RETURNED AND LEARNT THIS
BUT THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE MADE UP TO THEM WHEN THE WAGES WERE PAID AND WORKED ON FASTING AT EVENING WHEN THEY CAME TO PAY THE WAGES IN KIND DHARMU'S NAME WAS CALLED OUT FIRST
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
AND KARAM GOSAIN CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT PREPARATIONS DHARMU WAS MAKING IN HIS HONOUR AND HE WATCHED FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE JUST THEN DHARMU STRAINED OFF THE WATER FROM THE COOKED RICE
BECAUSE OF THE TATTERED SOLDIER'S QUESTION HE NOW FELT THAT HIS SHAME COULD BE VIEWED HE WAS CONTINUALLY CASTING SIDELONG GLANCES TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE CONTEMPLATING THE LETTERS OF GUILT HE FELT BURNED INTO HIS BROW
THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
DOUBTS AND HE WERE STRUGGLING HE WOULD TRULY BE A WORM IF ANY OF HIS COMRADES SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING THUS THE MARKS OF HIS FLIGHT UPON HIM
WHATEVER IT WAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE SAID THERE LAY THE FAULT THE HASTE OF THE COLUMN TO REACH THE BATTLE SEEMED TO THE FORLORN YOUNG MAN TO BE SOMETHING MUCH FINER THAN STOUT FIGHTING HEROES HE THOUGHT
O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU THEN THEY CAME TO A MANGO TREE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND THEY WENT ON AND SAW A COW WITH A CALF AND THEY THOUGHT
TO DISCOVER WHEN HE WOULD RUN WHEREVER HE WENT IN CAMP HE WOULD ENCOUNTER INSOLENT AND LINGERINGLY CRUEL STARES AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF PASSING NEAR A CROWD OF COMRADES HE COULD HEAR ONE SAY
AND THE BUFFALO SAID GO ON TO THE BANK OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A HORSE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CATCH IT AND MOUNT IT BUT IT KICKED AND SNORTED AND THEY SANG
AND APPEARING WITH THE VALOR AND CONFIDENCE OF UNCONQUERED LEGIONS THE SHRILLING VOICES OF THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD PIPE DISMALLY FOR A TIME
I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
ARE TRUE OF ALL THE COUNTLESS DEAD AND NOW TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE MANY MEN HE LOVED TO DO THE LAST SAD OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WE GIVE HIS SACRED DUST
IN EXTREME MISERY THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
ALMOST OF JOY THERE IS FOR THEM THIS CONSOLATION THE DEAD DO NOT SUFFER IF THEY LIVE AGAIN THEIR LIVES WILL SURELY BE AS GOOD AS OURS WE HAVE NO FEAR
AND DROPPING A FEW TEARS NO SOONER HAD SHE SET FOOT IN CANDIDE'S APARTMENT THAN SHE CRIED OUT
WELL SAID HE HAVE I NOT WON THE WHOLE WAGER
WHISPERED WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I AM BETTER NOW LET US BELIEVE IN SPITE OF DOUBTS AND DOGMAS AND TEARS AND FEARS THAT THESE DEAR WORDS
I WAS SOON SUPPLANTED BY A RIVAL TURNED OUT OF DOORS QUITE DESTITUTE AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE
THIS IS ONE OF THE MISERIES OF THE TRADE YESTERDAY I WAS ROBBED AND BEATEN BY AN OFFICER YET TO DAY I MUST PUT ON GOOD HUMOUR TO PLEASE A FRIAR CANDIDE WANTED NO MORE CONVINCING HE OWNED THAT MARTIN WAS IN THE RIGHT
AND ONE THOUSAND TO FRIAR GIROFLEE I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT AT ALL SAID MARTIN YOU WILL PERHAPS WITH THESE PIASTRES ONLY RENDER THEM THE MORE UNHAPPY
HE SIDED WITH THE WEAK AND WITH A WILLING HAND GAVE ALMS WITH LOYAL HEART AND WITH THE PUREST HAND HE FAITHFUL DISCHARGED ALL PUBLIC TRUSTS HE WAS A WORSHIPER OF LIBERTY
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS AND THE FAIR CUNEGONDE I SWEAR TO YOU THAT MY FATE HAS BEEN SCARCELY LESS SAD
THE POOR BARBARIAN WEEPING ABOVE HIS DEAD CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS INTELLIGENTLY AND SATISFACTORILY AS THE ROBED PRIEST OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREED
I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY
THIS BRAVE AND TENDER MAN IN EVERY STORM OF LIFE WAS OAK AND ROCK BUT IN THE SUNSHINE HE WAS VINE AND FLOWER HE WAS THE FRIEND OF ALL HEROIC SOULS
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS
OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
BRIGHTENING AND SOBS BECOMING HUSHED THE COLONEL SAID MY FRIENDS I KNOW HOW VAIN IT IS TO GILD A GRIEF WITH WORDS AND YET I WISH TO TAKE FROM EVERY GRAVE ITS FEAR
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
A GONDOLIER AN ABBE TO BE EXPOSED TO ABUSE AND INSULTS TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN
IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY
CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
BROKEN ONLY BY THE MOTHER'S SOBS UNTIL THE UNDERTAKER ADVANCED TOWARD A STOUT FLORID COMPLEXIONED GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY AND WHISPERED TO HIM THE WORDS BEING INAUDIBLE TO THE LOOKERS ON
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES TO HAVE A BUTTOCK CUT OFF TO RUN THE GAUNTLET AMONG THE BULGARIANS TO BE WHIPPED AND HANGED AT AN AUTO DA FE
THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
SPEECH CAN NOT CONTAIN OUR LOVE THERE WAS THERE IS NO GENTLER STRONGER
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE
ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
HE CONSULTED PANGLOSS MARTIN AND THE FAITHFUL CACAMBO
IT MAY BE THAT DEATH GIVES ALL THERE IS OF WORTH TO LIFE IF THOSE WHO PRESS AND STRAIN AGAINST OUR HEARTS COULD NEVER DIE PERHAPS THAT LOVE WOULD WITHER FROM THE EARTH
THE GIRL BLUSHED THE THEATIN ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND SHE FOLLOWED HIM
WHILE YET IN LOVE WITH LIFE AND RAPTURED WITH THE WORLD HE PASSED TO SILENCE AND PATHETIC DUST YET AFTER ALL IT MAY BE BEST
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
BROTHER OF THE DECEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT INCLUDING SECRETARY SHERMAN ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAWLEY SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES PADDOCK ALLISON LOGAN
WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS MY FRIENDS I AM GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THE DEAD OFTEN PROMISED HE WOULD DO FOR ME THE LOVED AND LOVING BROTHER HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND
FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY OF MODERN ITALY AND ARE PURCHASED SO DEARLY BY SOVEREIGNS
OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
AND THE SAME FATE AWAITS US ALL WE TOO HAVE OUR RELIGION AND IT IS THIS HELP FOR THE LIVING HOPE FOR THE DEAD
HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD THAT SHE DIED TWO HOURS AFTER IN MOST HORRID CONVULSIONS THE WIFE'S RELATIONS PROSECUTED THE HUSBAND HE TOOK FLIGHT AND I WAS THROWN INTO JAIL
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS UNPROTECTED BY EITHER HAT OR UMBRELLA
WE CANNOT SAY THAT DEATH IS NOT GOOD WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE GRAVE IS THE END OF THIS LIFE OR THE DOOR OF ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE NIGHT HERE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE A DAWN
NEITHER CAN WE TELL WHICH IS THE MORE FORTUNATE THE CHILD DYING IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS BEFORE ITS LIPS HAVE LEARNED TO FORM A WORD
WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
YOU SANG AND YOU BEHAVED SO LOVINGLY TO THE THEATIN THAT YOU SEEMED TO ME AS HAPPY AS YOU PRETEND TO BE NOW THE REVERSE AH SIR ANSWERED PAQUETTE
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
THE PALL BEARERS WERE SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES DAVID DAVIS PADDOCK AND ALLISON COLONEL WARD H LAMON HON JEREMIAH WILSON OF INDIANA AND HON THOMAS A BOYD OF ILLINOIS
THEY INCLUDED DETECTIVE AND MISSUS GEORGE O MILLER AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS THE BURIAL OF THE FORMER'S BRIGHT LITTLE SON HARRY AS THE CASKET RESTED UPON THE TRESTLES THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM
AND IN A VOICE OF EXQUISITE CADENCE DELIVERED ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC EULOGIES FOR THE DEAD
THE FLOWER OF HEALTH SHINES IN YOUR FACE YOUR EXPRESSION MAKES PLAIN YOUR HAPPINESS YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY GIRL FOR YOUR RECREATION AND YOU SEEM WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR STATE AS A THEATIN MY FAITH SIR SAID FRIAR GIROFLEE
LET THAT BE AS IT MAY SAID CANDIDE BUT ONE THING CONSOLES ME I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE
THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHO YET SCARCELY APPEARS IN THE PIECE
SUCH SPECTACLES AS THESE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THEIR DISSERTATIONS AND WHEN THEY DID NOT DISPUTE TIME HUNG SO HEAVILY UPON THEIR HANDS THAT ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN VENTURED TO SAY TO THEM I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE
HE CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS AND LEFT ALL SUPERSTITIONS FAR BELOW WHILE ON HIS FOREHEAD FELL THE GOLDEN DAWNING OF A GRANDER DAY HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
THE LARGEST AND THE NOBLER FAITH IN ALL THAT IS AND IS TO BE TELLS US THAT DEATH EVEN AT ITS WORST IS ONLY PERFECT REST
CANDIDE HAD NOT VIEWED HER AS YET WITH ATTENTION HIS THOUGHTS BEING ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH CUNEGONDE BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE
I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
HERE IN THIS WORLD WHERE LIFE AND DEATH ARE EQUAL KINGS ALL SHOULD BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MEET WHAT ALL HAVE MET THE FUTURE HAS BEEN FILLED WITH FEAR STAINED AND POLLUTED BY THE HEARTLESS PAST
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
REASON THE ONLY TORCH JUSTICE THE ONLY WORSHIPER HUMANITY THE ONLY RELIGION AND LOVE THE PRIEST HE ADDED TO THE SUM OF HUMAN JOY
CANDIDE'S MELANCHOLY INCREASED AND MARTIN CONTINUED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE VIRTUE OR HAPPINESS UPON EARTH EXCEPT PERHAPS IN EL DORADO WHERE NOBODY COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
I WISH SAID MARTIN SHE MAY ONE DAY MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY BUT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH
PAQUETTE WORKED AT EMBROIDERY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
MY INNOCENCE WOULD NOT HAVE SAVED ME IF I HAD NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING THE JUDGE SET ME FREE ON CONDITION THAT HE SUCCEEDED THE SURGEON
THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT
THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
THE UNDERTAKER GAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE NOD MISTER MILLER LOOKED APPEALINGLY TOWARD THE DISTINGUISHED ORATOR AND THEN COLONEL INGERSOLL ADVANCED TO THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE MADE A MOTION DENOTING A DESIRE FOR SILENCE
YOU KNOW SIR WHAT A DANGEROUS THING IT IS FOR AN ILL NATURED WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO A DOCTOR INCENSED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS WIFE
BUT IN ALL THESE VOLUMES THERE IS NOTHING BUT CHIMERICAL SYSTEMS AND NOT A SINGLE USEFUL THING AND WHAT DRAMATIC WORKS I SEE HERE SAID CANDIDE IN ITALIAN SPANISH AND FRENCH YES
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK
THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
DIED WHERE MANHOOD'S MORNING ALMOST TOUCHES NOON AND WHILE THE SHADOWS STILL WERE FALLING TOWARD THE WEST HE HAD NOT PASSED ON LIFE'S HIGHWAY THE STONE THAT MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT
WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THAT WHICH WILL COME TO ALL THAT IS WE CANNOT TELL WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE GREATEST BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH
BUT BEING WEARY FOR A MOMENT HE LAY DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE AND USING HIS BURDEN FOR A PILLOW FELL INTO THAT DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT KISSES DOWN HIS EYELIDS STILL
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
THE TEARFUL IGNORANCE OF THE ONE IS JUST AS CONSOLING AS THE LEARNED AND UNMEANING WORDS OF THE OTHER
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING
THAT TROY SO LONG BESIEGED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL THESE TOGETHER CAUSED ME GREAT WEARINESS I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK
MOST EXQUISITE YET ONE OF THE MOST SAD AND MOURNFUL SERMONS THE FUNERAL OF
AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL A FRIEND OF THE MILLERS WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AT THEIR REQUEST HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THE UNDERTAKER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM AND THEN SAID SUDDENLY DOES MISSUS MILLER DESIRE IT
AND A FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIM QUOTE THE WORDS FOR JUSTICE ALL PLACE A TEMPLE AND ALL SEASON SUMMER HE BELIEVED THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE ONLY GOOD
MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT AND FINALLY HE BOWED HIS HEAD UPON THE DEAD MAN'S COFFIN IN UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF IT WAS AFTER SOME DELAY AND THE GREATEST EFFORTS OF SELF MASTERY THAT COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS ABLE TO FINISH READING HIS ADDRESS
SOON AFTER MISTER INGERSOLL BEGAN TO READ HIS ELOQUENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEAD HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE TRIED TO HIDE THEM BEHIND HIS EYE GLASSES
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
