I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
AFY DECLARED HE WAS WITH HER REPEATED MISTER CARLYLE LOOK HERE SIR YOU ARE A SHARP MAN AND FOLKS SAY I AM NOT BUT I CAN SEE THINGS AND DRAW MY REASONING AS WELL AS THEY CAN PERHAPS
PREVENTED THEIR DOING MORE THAN GOING THROUGH THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE BY INFORMING THEMSELVES HOW WELL THE OTHER LIKED BATH HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED ITS BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHETHER SHE DREW OR PLAYED OR SANG
AND SHE WILL BE AS ANXIOUS TO SHIELD YOU FROM DANGER AS I CAN BE IS IT CRIED THE RELIEVED RICHARD CAN'T YOU MAKE HER KEEP OUT HE CONTINUED HIS TEETH STILL CHATTERING
BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS SPOKEN THE ROOM DOOR WAS TRIED AND THEN GENTLY KNOCKED AT MISTER CARLYLE PLACED HIS HAND ON RICHARD WHO WAS LOOKING SCARED OUT OF HIS WITS
OF THE HORSES AND DOGS OF THE FRIEND WHOM HE HAD JUST LEFT AND OF A PROPOSED EXCHANGE OF TERRIERS BETWEEN THEM INTEREST HER SO MUCH AS TO PREVENT HER LOOKING VERY OFTEN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD LEFT MISTER TILNEY
ON MISSUS ALLEN'S BOSOM CATHERINE SAT ERECT IN THE PERFECT USE OF HER SENSES AND WITH CHEEKS ONLY A LITTLE REDDER THAN USUAL MISTER TILNEY AND HIS COMPANION WHO CONTINUED THOUGH SLOWLY TO APPROACH
HE HAD NOT BEHAVED HE HAD NOT TALKED LIKE THE MARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN USED HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED A WIFE AND HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED A SISTER FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPRANG THE INSTANT CONCLUSION OF HIS SISTER'S NOW BEING BY HIS SIDE
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
I TELL HIM HE IS QUITE IN LUCK TO BE SENT HERE FOR HIS HEALTH AND I HOPE MADAM THAT MISTER ALLEN WILL BE OBLIGED TO LIKE THE PLACE FROM FINDING IT OF SERVICE TO HIM THANK YOU SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL
SHE SAT ON FIVE MINUTES LONGER AND THEN LEFT WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE RESUMED HIS READING BUT ANOTHER PAGE OR TWO CONCLUDED THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH MISTER CARLYLE THREW THE BOOK ON THE TABLE
LOUD ENOUGH TO BRING THE VERY HOUSE DOWN NO OFFICERS OF JUSTICE SEARCHING FOR A FUGITIVE EVER MADE A LOUDER RICHARD HARE HIS FACE TURNED TO CHALK HIS EYES STARTING
SHE WAS SHARING WITH THE SCORES OF OTHER YOUNG LADIES STILL SITTING DOWN ALL THE DISCREDIT OF WANTING A PARTNER TO BE DISGRACED IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD TO WEAR THE APPEARANCE OF INFAMY WHILE HER HEART IS ALL PURITY
WHETHER HE DID COMMIT THE MURDER OR WHETHER HE DIDN'T HE MUST KNOW THAT I DID NOT BECAUSE HE CAME UPON ME WAITING AS HE WAS TEARING FROM THE COTTAGE DICK'S REASONING WAS NOT BAD ANOTHER THING HE RESUMED
AND TURNING ROUND PERCEIVED MISSUS HUGHES DIRECTLY BEHIND HER ATTENDED BY MISS TILNEY AND A GENTLEMAN I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS MORLAND SAID SHE FOR THIS LIBERTY BUT I CANNOT ANYHOW GET TO MISS THORPE
AND I WISHED TO KNOW HIS NAME WELL MISTER CARLYLE I COULD GET AT NOTHING SATISFACTORY THE FELLOW SAID THAT A GREAT MANY HAD CALLED THERE THAT DAY FOR HIS MASTER WAS JUST UP FROM A LONG ILLNESS AND PEOPLE CAME TO SEE HIM IS THAT ALL RICHARD
WE DIDN'T GO MUCH MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A STREET I WAS ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THORN WAS AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT WHITE I MARKED THE HOUSE THINKING IT WAS WHERE HE LIVED AND
FOR SOME CUPBOARD OR MOUSE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP AND SEEING NONE RUSHED TO THE FIREPLACE AND PLACED HIS FOOT ON THE FENDER THAT HE PURPOSED AN ATTEMPT AT CHIMNEY CLIMBING WAS EVIDENT THOUGH HOW THE FIRE WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH HIS PANTALOONS
I HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR SIR INDEED AND AS I NEARED WEST LYNNE I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO IT WAS NO USE IN ME TRYING TO CATCH BARBARA'S ATTENTION
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT MISS CARLYLE INVITED HER TO THEIRS OF AN EVENING AND THE HOUSE WAS QUITE MISTER CARLYLE WAS DEEP IN THE PAGES OF ONE OF THE MONTHLY PERIODICALS AND MISS CARLYLE SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE GRUMBLING
AND SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF MANY IDEAS BY A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND OR A SMILE OF AFFECTION THE DANCING BEGAN WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AND JAMES WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED QUITE AS LONG AS HIS SISTER
MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH IT IS JUST NINE CORNELIA THEN I THINK I SHALL GO TO BED I'LL HAVE A BASIN OF ARROWROOT OR GRUEL OR SOME SLOP OF THAT SORT AFTER I'M IN IT
BY WHOM HE WAS VERY CIVILLY ACKNOWLEDGED I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR INDEED I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD LEFT BATH HE THANKED HER FOR HER FEARS
ROSE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF TIRED OF SITTING HE STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BRIGHTER BLAZE AND STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG I WONDER IF IT SNOWS STILL HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DROPPED UPON HIM PREVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE NO SIR AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO SHOW MYSELF IN THOSE LATTER PARTS OF THE TOWN FEARING I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW AT HOME
HE IS A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INDEED HE IS MISSUS ALLEN SAID MISSUS THORPE SMILING COMPLACENTLY I MUST SAY IT THOUGH I AM HIS MOTHER THAT THERE IS NOT A MORE AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD
WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED
BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE AH HE HAS GOT A PARTNER I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU SAID MISSUS ALLEN AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SHE ADDED
AGAIN I SAW HIM STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE BETTING ROOMS TALKING TO THE SAME GENTLEMAN AND HIS FACE TURNED SAVAGE I BELIEVE WITH FEAR AS MUCH AS ANGER WHEN HE DISCERNED ME HE SEEMED TO HESITATE AND THEN AS IF HE ACTED IN A PASSION
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT MIND MY GOING AWAY AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT CATHERINE THOUGH A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
COME ALONG MY DEAREST CATHERINE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE AND STAND BY ME AND OFF THEY WENT TO REGAIN THEIR FORMER PLACE JOHN THORPE IN THE MEANWHILE HAD WALKED AWAY AND CATHERINE EVER WILLING TO GIVE MISTER TILNEY AN OPPORTUNITY
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION
RICHARD BE A MAN PUT ASIDE THIS WEAKNESS THIS FEAR HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT HARM SHALL NOT COME NEAR YOU IN MY HOUSE IT MAY BE THAT OFFICER FROM LONDON
HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
RICHARD HARE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MY PROOFS OF HIS GUILT MISTER CARLYLE I COULD BRING NONE AGAINST HIM NO POSITIVE ONES
I ASSURE YOU SAID SHE I WOULD NOT STAND UP WITHOUT YOUR DEAR SISTER FOR ALL THE WORLD FOR IF I DID WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SEPARATED THE WHOLE EVENING CATHERINE ACCEPTED THIS KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE
MISS CARLYLE HAS LEFT HER HANDKERCHIEF DOWNSTAIRS SIR AND HAS SENT ME FOR IT YOU CANNOT COME IN I AM BUSY WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN A CLEAR AND MOST DECISIVE TONE
ON THE VERY MORNING AFTER HIS HAVING HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER WELL SIR AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE NOT SORRY TO BE BACK AGAIN FOR IT IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TOO
BUT ALL IN VAIN HE WOULD NOT STIR AN INCH WAS NOT IT SO MISTER MORLAND BUT YOU MEN ARE ALL SO IMMODERATELY LAZY
IN THIS COMMONPLACE CHATTER WHICH LASTED SOME TIME THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT SEEMED ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN
BUT IF YOU THINK IT WRONG YOU HAD MUCH BETTER CHANGE THERE CRIED ISABELLA YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS AND YET YOU WILL NOT MIND HER
NO ONE SHALL COME IN IT IS ONLY PETER NOT PETER'S VOICE HOWEVER BUT JOYCE'S WAS HEARD IN RESPONSE TO MISTER CARLYLE'S DEMAND OF WHO WAS THERE
TALKING TO A CAB DRIVER WHEN SOME DROPS OF RAIN CAME DOWN A GENTLEMAN AND LADY WERE PASSING AT THE TIME BUT I HAD NOT PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THEM BY JOVE I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM TO HER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEPPER
LOCK THE DOOR SIR WERE HIS FIRST WORDS NEED YOU BE TOLD THAT IT WAS RICHARD HARE MISTER CARLYLE FASTENED THE WINDOW DREW THE HEAVY CURTAINS ACROSS AND TURNED RAPIDLY TO LOCK THE TWO DOORS
HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE OTHERS RISING UP ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND SAY GOOD BYE MY DEAR LOVE BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF
OF HER DEAR ISABELLA TO WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY LONGED TO POINT OUT THAT GENTLEMAN SHE COULD SEE NOTHING THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SETS SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM ALL HER PARTY AND AWAY FROM ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORTIFICATION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER
AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS
YOU MEN HAVE SUCH RESTLESS CURIOSITY TALK OF THE CURIOSITY OF WOMEN INDEED TIS NOTHING BUT BE SATISFIED FOR YOU ARE NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL OF THE MATTER AND IS THAT LIKELY TO SATISFY ME DO YOU THINK
I BOLTED UNDER THE HORSES OF A PASSING VEHICLE DOWN SOME TURNINGS AND PASSAGES OUT INTO ANOTHER STREET AND UP BESIDE A CABMAN WHO WAS ON HIS BOX DRIVING A FARE PAST I REACHED MY LODGINGS IN SAFETY AS I THOUGHT
A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS DOCTOR SKINNER WAS HERE FOR HIS HEALTH LAST WINTER AND CAME AWAY QUITE STOUT
YES SIR AND DOCTOR SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS SO I TELL MISTER ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY
LET ME LOOK AT HER THIS MOMENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL GIRL I NEVER SAW ANYTHING HALF SO BEAUTIFUL BUT WHERE IS HER ALL CONQUERING BROTHER IS HE IN THE ROOM
WHO WAS IT QUIVERED RICHARD AS JOYCE WAS HEARD GOING AWAY IT WAS JOYCE WHAT IS SHE HERE STILL
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
DOES CAPTAIN THORN LIVE HERE I ASKED HIM MISTER WESTLEBY LIVES HERE SAID HE I DON'T KNOW ANY CAPTAIN THORN
OH THERE'S NO MISTAKING HIS POSITION THAT HE MOVES IN THE HIGHER CLASSES THERE'S NO DOUBT THE CAB DROVE AWAY AND I GOT UP BEHIND IT THE DRIVER THOUGHT BOYS WERE THERE AND TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS WHIP BUT I MADE HIM A SIGN
RICHARD I QUESTIONED AFY ABOUT THORN SHE PROTESTED SOLEMNLY TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT THORN WHO COMMITTED THE DEED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE FOR THORN WAS WITH HER AT THE MOMENT OF ITS BEING DONE IT'S NOT TRUE
AND THIS PERSUASION DID NOT INCLINE HER TO A VERY GRACIOUS REPLY WHEN JOHN THORPE CAME UP TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS AND SAID WELL MISS MORLAND I SUPPOSE YOU AND I ARE TO STAND UP AND JIG IT TOGETHER AGAIN OH NO I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
WELL I COULD NOT REST I WAS HALF MAD I SAY AND WENT ABOUT STILL TRYING IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER HIS NAME AND WHO HE WAS I DID COME UPON HIM BUT HE WAS WALKING QUICKLY ARM IN ARM WITH WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
PRODUCED SEVERE MORTIFICATION TO THE LADY AND IN GIVING HER DENIAL SHE EXPRESSED HER SORROW ON THE OCCASION SO VERY MUCH AS IF SHE REALLY FELT IT THAT HAD THORPE WHO JOINED HER JUST AFTERWARDS BEEN HALF A MINUTE EARLIER
AND WHOM CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY GUESSED TO BE HIS SISTER THUS UNTHINKINGLY THROWING AWAY A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF CONSIDERING HIM LOST TO HER FOREVER BY BEING MARRIED ALREADY BUT GUIDED ONLY BY WHAT WAS SIMPLE AND PROBABLE
HE WOULD TURN ROUND UPON ME NOW AND SWEAR MY LIFE AWAY TO MURDER WELL I THOUGHT I'D ASCERTAIN FOR CERTAIN WHAT HIS NAME WAS AND THAT NIGHT I WENT TO THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR
NO THAT I CAN'T IF SHE HAS A MIND TO COME IN WAS THE CANDID ANSWER YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE WAS RICHARD SHE IS NOT ALTERED KNOWING THAT TO SPEAK ON THIS SIDE THE DOOR TO HIS SISTER
CATHERINE HAD FORTITUDE TOO SHE SUFFERED BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION SHE WAS ROUSED AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES
SHE MUST HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE ENEMY BUT TRIFLING AILMENTS SUCH AS HEADACHE INFLUENZA SORE THROAT WHICH OTHER PEOPLE GET PASSED HER BY IMAGINE THEREFORE HER EXASPERATION AT FINDING HER HEAD STUFFED UP
IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM
I HAVE BEEN PRETTY NEARLY EVER SINCE ON MY FEET REACHING HERE I ONLY GOT A LIFT NOW AND THEN BUT RICHARD DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST LYNNE IS THE VERY WORST PLACE YOU COULD HAVE FLOWN TO
I HAVE BEEN QUITE WRETCHED WITHOUT YOU MY DEAR ISABELLA HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET AT YOU I COULD NOT EVEN SEE WHERE YOU WERE SO I TOLD YOUR BROTHER ALL THE TIME BUT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME
AND HIS OWN LIGHT HAIR BRISTLING UP WITH HORROR STRUGGLED INTO HIS WET SMOCK FROCK AFTER A FASHION THE TAILS UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND THE SLEEVES HANGING FORCED ON HIS HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS LOOKED ROUND IN A BEWILDERED MANNER
TO A PLEASANTER FEELING BY SEEING NOT MISTER THORPE BUT MISTER TILNEY WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING THAT WAY BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE BLUSH
AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
OUR TWO DANCES ARE OVER AND BESIDES I AM TIRED AND DO NOT MEAN TO DANCE ANY MORE DO NOT YOU THEN LET US WALK ABOUT AND QUIZ PEOPLE COME ALONG WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FOUR GREATEST QUIZZERS IN THE ROOM
AND YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT MISTER CARLYLE IT WAS THE MAN THORN INDEED YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN HIM THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT
IN SPITE OF UDOLPHO AND THE DRESSMAKER HOWEVER THE PARTY FROM PULTENEY STREET REACHED THE UPPER ROOMS IN VERY GOOD TIME THE THORPES AND JAMES MORLAND WERE THERE ONLY TWO MINUTES BEFORE THEM
I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS AND THEIR PARTNERS I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THEM THIS HALF HOUR AGAIN CATHERINE EXCUSED HERSELF AND AT LAST HE WALKED OFF TO QUIZ HIS SISTERS BY HIMSELF THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE FOUND VERY DULL
OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
AND GRUNTING AND SNIFFLING AND CHOKING MISS CARLYLE WAS ONE OF YOUR STRONG MINDED LADIES WHO NEVER CONDESCENDED TO BE ILL OF COURSE HAD SHE BEEN ATTACKED WITH SCARLET FEVER OR PARALYSIS OR SAINT VITUS DANCE
PERHAPS HE HAS SONS I ASKED NOT ANY THE MAN ANSWERED THERE'S NOBODY BUT THEIR TWO SELVES
BUT HAPPENING TO GLANCE INTO THE STREET THERE I SAW THE MAN AGAIN STANDING OPPOSITE AND RECONNOITERING THE HOUSE I HAD GONE HOME HUNGRY BUT THIS TOOK ALL MY HUNGER AWAY FROM ME I OPENED THE BOX WHERE I KEPT MY DISGUISE
THE TONES STRUCK FAMILIARLY ON MISTER CARLYLE'S EAR HE DREW BACK MECHANICALLY A THOUSAND PERPLEXING SENSATIONS OVERWHELMING HIM AND THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM A WHITE MAN AS LUCY CALLED HER FATHER
SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS I HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR A LODGING
WELL I DECLARE I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE YOU WHAT CAN IT SIGNIFY TO YOU WHAT WE ARE TALKING OF PERHAPS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU THEREFORE I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO LISTEN OR YOU MAY HAPPEN TO HEAR SOMETHING NOT VERY AGREEABLE
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
A YOUNGISH MAN ISN'T HE SAID I VERY SMART WITH A PRETTY WIFE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL YOUNGISH HE LAUGHED MY MASTER'S TURNED SIXTY AND HIS WIFE'S AS OLD THAT CHECKED ME
I KNOW THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE RUSHED OUT IN THAT FRANTIC MANNER WITH THOSE SIGNS OF GUILT AND FEAR ABOUT HIM UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A BAD DEED WAS RICHARD HARE'S ANSWER IT COULD HAVE BEEN NO ONE ELSE
THE EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER AND THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER WHICH FELL ON ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE OF HOME PEACE THOUGH IT MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED THE NAME OF LUXURY WITHOUT
RICHARD UTTERED MISTER CARLYLE I AM THUNDERSTRUCK
AND CATHERINE CATCHING MISTER TILNEY'S EYE INSTANTLY RECEIVED FROM HIM THE SMILING TRIBUTE OF RECOGNITION SHE RETURNED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN ADVANCING STILL NEARER HE SPOKE BOTH TO HER AND MISSUS ALLEN
MISSUS HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE
AYE FOR HE HAD BEEN HOURS AND HOURS ON FOOT IN THE SNOW HIS HAT HIS CLOTHES HIS EYEBROWS
PROCEEDING TO THE WINDOW ONE OF THOSE OPENING TO THE GROUND HE THREW ASIDE THE HALF OF THE WARM CRIMSON CURTAIN IT ALL LOOKED DULL AND DARK OUTSIDE MISTER CARLYLE COULD SEE LITTLE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS
AND IT LIES SO DEEP IN PLACES THAT YOU HAVE TO COME ALONG AT A SNAIL'S PACE BUT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
I CUT OFF FROM LONDON AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE REPLIED RICHARD WHO WAS LITERALLY SHIVERING WITH THE COLD I'M DODGED MISTER CARLYLE I AM INDEED
VERY AGREEABLE MADAM I AM GLAD OF IT JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS HAS NOT HE DID YOU MEET MISTER TILNEY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WHERE IS HE
HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
MY SWEET CATHERINE DO SUPPORT ME PERSUADE YOUR BROTHER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TELL HIM THAT IT WOULD QUITE SHOCK YOU TO SEE ME DO SUCH A THING NOW WOULD NOT IT NO NOT AT ALL
I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME AT PRESENT HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AND SWORE THAT IF EVER HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME NEAR HIM AGAIN HE WOULD HAND ME OVER INTO CUSTODY
THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF MANY BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MISSUS ALLEN FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION SHE SAID IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE
IN A WEEK'S TIME I CAME UPON HIM AGAIN IT WAS AT NIGHT HE WAS COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE THEATRES AND I WENT UP AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT FELLOW HE ASKED I HAVE SEEN YOU WATCHING ME BEFORE THIS
I TELL MISTER ALLEN WHEN HE TALKS OF BEING SICK OF IT THAT I AM SURE HE SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN FOR IT IS SO VERY AGREEABLE A PLACE THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE HERE THAN AT HOME AT THIS DULL TIME OF YEAR
MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE
DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE
FIRED RICHARD IT WAS THORN RICHARD YOU CANNOT TELL
HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER SUFFERINGS RATHER TOO ACUTE THE VERY EASY MANNER IN WHICH HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE HAD KEPT HER WAITING DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RECONCILE HER MORE TO HER LOT NOR DID THE PARTICULARS WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WHILE THEY WERE STANDING UP
MISTER TILNEY WAS DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR PARTY AT TEA TO ATTEND THAT OF HIS PARTNER MISS TILNEY THOUGH BELONGING TO IT DID NOT SIT NEAR HER AND JAMES AND ISABELLA WERE SO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSING TOGETHER
I SHALL FIX MYSELF IN SOME OTHER BIG TOWN FAR AWAY FROM LONDON LIVERPOOL OR MANCHESTER PERHAPS AND SEE WHAT EMPLOYMENT I CAN GET INTO
AND HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND STEPPED HALF OUT THE SNOW WAS FALLING FASTER AND THICKER THAN EVER NOT AT THAT DID MISTER CARLYLE START WITH SURPRISE IF NOT WITH A MORE UNPLEASANT SENSATION
AND THEY CONTINUED AS THEY WERE FOR THREE MINUTES LONGER WHEN ISABELLA WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO JAMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER TURNED AGAIN TO HIS SISTER AND WHISPERED MY DEAR CREATURE I AM AFRAID I MUST LEAVE YOU YOUR BROTHER IS SO AMAZINGLY IMPATIENT TO BEGIN
NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED POOR DICK APPEARED COMPLETELY TO IGNORE MISTER CARLYLE DREW HIM BACK KEEPING HIS CALM POWERFUL HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER WHILE CERTAIN SOUNDS IN AN ANGRY VOICE WERE JERKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
AND WHETHER SHE WAS FOND OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK THE TWO DANCES WERE SCARCELY CONCLUDED BEFORE CATHERINE FOUND HER ARM GENTLY SEIZED BY HER FAITHFUL ISABELLA WHO IN GREAT SPIRITS EXCLAIMED AT LAST I HAVE GOT YOU
I DARE SAY SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW
OR THINK THEY KNOW SOME THINGS WHICH OTHER MEN HAVE TOLD THEM AH IT IS THE FAULT OF OUR SCIENCE THAT IT WANTS TO EXPLAIN ALL AND IF IT EXPLAIN NOT THEN IT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN
QUINCEY WROTE ME A LINE TOO AND FROM HIM I HEAR THAT ARTHUR IS BEGINNING TO RECOVER SOMETHING OF HIS OLD BUOYANCY SO AS TO THEM ALL MY MIND IS AT REST AS FOR MYSELF I WAS SETTLING DOWN TO MY WORK WITH THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH I USED TO HAVE FOR IT
HOW IN SOME ISLANDS OF THE WESTERN SEAS THERE ARE BATS WHICH HANG ON THE TREES ALL DAY AND THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN DESCRIBE AS LIKE GIANT NUTS OR PODS AND THAT WHEN THE SAILORS SLEEP ON THE DECK BECAUSE THAT IT IS HOT FLIT DOWN ON THEM AND THEN
SHE SOMETIMES KEPT A DIARY YOU NEED NOT LOOK SURPRISED MADAM MINA IT WAS BEGUN AFTER YOU HAD LEFT AND WAS IN IMITATION OF YOU AND IN THAT DIARY
BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE JOKE WAS OVER AND I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED SO I TOOK THE TYPEWRITTEN COPY FROM MY WORKBASKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM FORGIVE ME I SAID I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT
AND WHEN WE HAD SUPPED SHE TOLD ME OF VAN HELSING'S VISIT AND OF HER HAVING GIVEN HIM THE TWO DIARIES COPIED OUT AND OF HOW ANXIOUS SHE HAS BEEN ABOUT ME SHE SHOWED ME IN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT ALL I WROTE DOWN WAS TRUE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A NEW MAN OF ME
THAT JOURNAL IS ALL SO STRANGE AND I HESITATED TO GO ON BUT HE WAS SO SWEET AND KIND AND HE HAD PROMISED TO HELP AND I TRUSTED HIM SO I SAID
I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE LUMBERING THROUGH A BOG IN A MIST JUMPING FROM ONE TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER IN THE MERE BLIND EFFORT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I AM GOING
THAT AWFUL JOURNAL GETS HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION AND TINGES EVERYTHING WITH SOMETHING OF ITS OWN COLOUR OF COURSE IT IS ABOUT LUCY THAT HABIT CAME BACK TO THE POOR DEAR AND THAT AWFUL NIGHT ON THE CLIFF MUST HAVE MADE HER ILL
AND LOCK MYSELF UP IN MY ROOM AND READ IT TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER I HADN'T THE HEART TO WRITE LAST NIGHT THAT TERRIBLE RECORD OF JONATHAN'S UPSET ME SO
AND THRUST LAST NIGHT'S WESTMINSTER GAZETTE INTO MY HAND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE ASKED AS HE STOOD BACK AND FOLDED HIS ARMS I LOOKED OVER THE PAPER FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
IT IS THE COPY OF HIS JOURNAL WHEN ABROAD AND ALL THAT HAPPENED I DARE NOT SAY ANYTHING OF IT YOU WILL READ FOR YOURSELF AND JUDGE AND THEN WHEN I SEE YOU PERHAPS
A THOUSAND THANKS FOR YOUR KIND LETTER WHICH HAS TAKEN A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY MIND AND YET IF IT BE TRUE WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT AN AWFUL THING IF THAT MAN THAT MONSTER
WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
IS ALL THAT FEVER GONE AND IS HE STRONG AND HEARTY I SAW HERE AN OPENING TO ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN SO I SAID HE WAS ALMOST RECOVERED BUT HE HAS BEEN GREATLY UPSET
BE REALLY IN LONDON I FEAR TO THINK
YOU WILL PARDON PRAISE FROM AN OLD MAN BUT YOU ARE BLESSED IN YOUR WIFE I WOULD LISTEN TO HIM GO ON PRAISING MINA FOR A DAY SO I SIMPLY NODDED AND STOOD SILENT
IT WAS HALF PAST TWO O'CLOCK WHEN THE KNOCK CAME I TOOK MY COURAGE A DEUX MAINS AND WAITED IN A FEW MINUTES MARY OPENED THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I ROSE AND BOWED AND HE CAME TOWARDS ME
IT WAS SO FUNNY TO HEAR MY WIFE CALLED MADAM MINA BY THIS KINDLY STRONG FACED OLD MAN I SMILED AND SAID I WAS ILL I HAVE HAD A SHOCK BUT YOU HAVE CURED ME ALREADY AND HOW
NOR IN HYPNOTISM YES I SAID CHARCOT HAS PROVED THAT PRETTY WELL HE SMILED AS HE WENT ON THEN YOU ARE SATISFIED AS TO IT YES
TILL ON DESCENDING HE COULD DRINK THE OIL OF ALL THE CHURCH LAMPS CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IN THE PAMPAS AY AND ELSEWHERE
AND WHAT HE LIKE NOT WHERE HE LOVE IS NOT TO HIS GOOD THEREFORE FOR HIS SAKE YOU MUST EAT AND SMILE
HERE I INTERRUPTED HIM I WAS GETTING BEWILDERED HE SO CROWDED ON MY MIND HIS LIST OF NATURE'S ECCENTRICITIES AND POSSIBLE IMPOSSIBILITIES THAT MY IMAGINATION WAS GETTING FIRED
I HOPE I DID RIGHT IN NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF IT TO MISSUS WESTENRA I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF ANY ACT OF MINE WERE IT EVEN A NEGATIVE ONE BROUGHT HARM ON POOR DEAR LUCY
BUT HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND POINTED OUT A PARAGRAPH ABOUT CHILDREN BEING DECOYED AWAY AT HAMPSTEAD IT DID NOT CONVEY MUCH TO ME UNTIL I REACHED A PASSAGE WHERE IT DESCRIBED SMALL PUNCTURED WOUNDS ON THEIR THROATS AN IDEA STRUCK ME AND I LOOKED UP
THAT I HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME FOR FRIENDSHIPS BUT SINCE I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED TO HERE BY MY FRIEND JOHN SEWARD I HAVE KNOWN SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE AND SEEN SUCH NOBILITY THAT I FEEL MORE THAN EVER
AND THE FEAR THAT HAS BEEN BROODING OVER ME EVER SINCE ALL CAME IN A TUMULT I SUPPOSE I WAS HYSTERICAL FOR I THREW MYSELF ON MY KNEES AND HELD UP MY HANDS TO HIM AND IMPLORED HIM TO MAKE MY HUSBAND WELL AGAIN
OH MADAM MINA GOOD WOMEN TELL ALL THEIR LIVES AND BY DAY AND BY HOUR AND BY MINUTE SUCH THINGS THAT ANGELS CAN READ AND WE MEN WHO WISH TO KNOW HAVE IN US SOMETHING OF ANGELS EYES
I CAN TELL YOU I THINK DOCTOR VAN HELSING ALL ABOUT IT AH THEN YOU HAVE GOOD MEMORY FOR FACTS FOR DETAILS IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO WITH YOUNG LADIES NO DOCTOR BUT I WROTE IT ALL DOWN AT THE TIME
WELL I SHALL TELL YOU MY THESIS IS THIS I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE TO BELIEVE WHAT TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT
TO MAKE HIS LIFE STRONG AND MANLY AND YOUR LIFE A HAPPY ONE NOW YOU MUST EAT YOU ARE OVERWROUGHT AND PERHAPS OVER ANXIOUS HUSBAND JONATHAN WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE YOU SO PALE
I HAD A LETTER FROM ARTHUR WRITTEN ON SUNDAY AND FROM IT I GATHER
POOR DEAR HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR ONLY IMAGINATION I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN IT AT ALL DID HE GET HIS BRAIN FEVER AND THEN WRITE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
THAT MAY BE MORE GREAT THAN YOU CAN KNOW MAY IT BE THAT I SEE YOU YOU CAN TRUST ME I AM FRIEND OF DOCTOR JOHN SEWARD AND OF LORD GODALMING THAT WAS ARTHUR OF MISS LUCY I MUST KEEP IT PRIVATE FOR THE PRESENT FROM ALL
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHEN OTHER SPIDERS DIE SMALL AND SOON THAT ONE GREAT SPIDER LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE TOWER OF THE OLD SPANISH CHURCH AND GREW AND GREW
I CANNOT HELP FEELING TERRIBLY EXCITED AS THE TIME DRAWS NEAR FOR THE VISIT OF DOCTOR VAN HELSING FOR SOMEHOW I EXPECT THAT IT WILL THROW SOME LIGHT UPON JONATHAN'S SAD EXPERIENCE AND AS HE ATTENDED POOR DEAR LUCY IN HER LAST ILLNESS HE CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT HER
UNLESS SOME SOLEMN DUTY COME UPON ME TO GO BACK TO THE BITTER HOURS ASLEEP OR AWAKE MAD OR SANE THERE SEEMS TO BE THROUGH IT ALL SOME THREAD OF CONTINUITY THAT FEARFUL COUNT WAS COMING TO LONDON
YOU DON'T YOU COULDN'T WITH EYEBROWS LIKE YOURS HE SEEMED PLEASED AND LAUGHED AS HE SAID SO YOU ARE PHYSIOGNOMIST I LEARN MORE HERE WITH EACH HOUR I AM WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE COMING TO YOU TO BREAKFAST AND OH SIR
AND KEEPING PACE IN ALL WAYS WITH THE DUTIES THAT COME UPON HIM HE WILL BE AWAY ALL DAY TILL LATE FOR HE SAID HE COULD NOT LUNCH AT HOME MY HOUSEHOLD WORK IS DONE SO I SHALL TAKE HIS FOREIGN JOURNAL
AND NEVER LET HIM BE TROUBLED OR WORRIED WITH IT AT ALL IF EVER JONATHAN QUITE GETS OVER THE NERVOUSNESS HE MAY WANT TO TELL ME OF IT ALL AND I CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT THINGS AND SEE HOW I MAY COMFORT HIM LETTER
HE MEANT THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND NOT LET A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH CHECK THE RUSH OF A BIG TRUTH LIKE A SMALL ROCK DOES A RAILWAY TRUCK WE GET THE SMALL TRUTH FIRST GOOD
VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER CONFIDENCE DEAR MADAM I PRAY YOU TO PARDON MY WRITING IN THAT I AM SO FAR FRIEND AS THAT I SENT TO YOU SAD NEWS OF MISS LUCY WESTENRA'S DEATH
SO SOON I DO NOT THINK HE REMEMBERED ME AT THE MOMENT JUST THEN THE WHISTLE BLEW AND THE TRAIN MOVED OFF THIS RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF AND HE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WAVED HIS HAND CALLING OUT LOVE TO MADAM MINA
JONATHAN WILL BE HERE AT HALF PAST ELEVEN AND YOU MUST COME TO LUNCH WITH US AND SEE HIM THEN YOU COULD CATCH THE QUICK THREE THIRTY FOUR TRAIN WHICH WILL LEAVE YOU AT PADDINGTON BEFORE EIGHT HE WAS SURPRISED AT MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRAINS OFF HAND
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER JONATHAN IS BETTER AFTER A BAD NIGHT I AM SO GLAD THAT HE HAS PLENTY OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT KEEPS HIS MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS
MADAM MINA IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEAD I COME SIR I SAID YOU COULD HAVE NO BETTER CLAIM ON ME THAN THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND AND HELPER OF LUCY WESTENRA AND I HELD OUT MY HAND
I HAD BEEN THINKING THAT IT WAS OF DEAR LUCY THAT YOU WISHED TO ASK AND SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO WAIT NOT ON MY ACCOUNT BUT BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR TIME MUST BE PRECIOUS I HAVE WRITTEN IT OUT ON THE TYPEWRITER FOR YOU HE TOOK IT AND HIS EYES GLISTENED
I HAD A DIM IDEA THAT HE WAS TEACHING ME SOME LESSON AS LONG AGO HE USED TO DO IN HIS STUDY AT AMSTERDAM
AND OH I AM REJOICED THAT HE IS NOT NOW WEIGHED DOWN WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS NEW POSITION I KNEW HE WOULD BE TRUE TO HIMSELF AND NOW HOW PROUD I AM TO SEE MY JONATHAN RISING TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS ADVANCEMENT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
AND NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN IT CAME TO SPEAKING TO THIS GREAT LEARNED MAN I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD THINK ME A WEAK FOOL AND JONATHAN A MADMAN
HE TOOK MY HANDS AND RAISED ME UP AND MADE ME SIT ON THE SOFA AND SAT BY ME HE HELD MY HAND IN HIS AND SAID TO ME WITH OH SUCH INFINITE SWEETNESS
LETTER BY HAND VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER SIXTH O'CLOCK DEAR MADAM MINA I HAVE READ YOUR HUSBAND'S SO WONDERFUL DIARY YOU MAY SLEEP WITHOUT DOUBT STRANGE AND TERRIBLE AS IT IS IT IS TRUE

AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU IS MUCH IN THIS AGE SO SCEPTICAL AND SELFISH AND YOU SIR I HAVE READ ALL THE LETTERS TO POOR MISS LUCY AND SOME OF THEM SPEAK OF YOU SO I KNOW YOU SINCE SOME DAYS FROM THE KNOWING OF OTHERS
THAT SEEM TO BROADEN AS THE BIG BUSHY BROWS COME DOWN AND THE MOUTH TIGHTENS THE FOREHEAD IS BROAD AND FINE RISING AT FIRST ALMOST STRAIGHT AND THEN SLOPING BACK ABOVE TWO BUMPS OR RIDGES WIDE APART
WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER

TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER COME TO DAY BY QUARTER PAST TEN TRAIN IF YOU CAN CATCH IT CAN SEE YOU ANY TIME YOU CALL WILHELMINA HARKER MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER
A MAN OF MEDIUM WEIGHT STRONGLY BUILT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SET BACK OVER A BROAD DEEP CHEST AND A NECK WELL BALANCED ON THE TRUNK
I ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT SO HE AT ONCE BEGAN I HAVE READ YOUR LETTERS TO MISS LUCY FORGIVE ME BUT I HAD TO BEGIN TO INQUIRE SOMEWHERE AND THERE WAS NONE TO ASK I KNOW THAT YOU WERE WITH HER AT WHITBY
IS AS SUNSHINE IT OPENS THE GATE TO ME
YOUR HUSBAND IS NOBLE NATURE AND YOU ARE NOBLE TOO FOR YOU TRUST AND TRUST CANNOT BE WHERE THERE IS MEAN NATURE AND YOUR HUSBAND TELL ME OF HIM IS HE QUITE WELL
AS WIZARDS THERE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIES IN LIFE
SO I HANDED HIM THE SHORTHAND DIARY HE TOOK IT WITH A GRATEFUL BOW AND SAID MAY I READ IT IF YOU WISH I ANSWERED AS DEMURELY AS I COULD HE OPENED IT AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS FACE FELL THEN HE STOOD UP AND BOWED
AND NOT THINK ME FOOLISH THAT I HAVE EVEN HALF BELIEVED SOME VERY STRANGE THINGS HE REASSURED ME BY HIS MANNER AS WELL AS HIS WORDS WHEN HE SAID OH MY DEAR IF YOU ONLY KNOW HOW STRANGE IS THE MATTER REGARDING WHICH I AM HERE
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOME ONE WHO RECALLED SOMETHING TERRIBLE SOMETHING WHICH LED TO HIS BRAIN FEVER AND HERE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO OVERWHELM ME IN A RUSH THE PITY FOR JONATHAN THE HORROR WHICH HE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE FEARFUL MYSTERY OF HIS DIARY
AND CORN SOWED ON IT AND THE CORN REAPED AND BE CUT AND SOWN AND REAPED AND CUT AGAIN AND THEN MEN COME AND TAKE AWAY THE UNBROKEN SEAL AND THAT THERE LIE THE INDIAN FAKIR NOT DEAD BUT THAT RISE UP AND WALK AMONGST THEM AS BEFORE
SHE TRACES BY INFERENCE CERTAIN THINGS TO A SLEEP WALKING IN WHICH SHE PUTS DOWN THAT YOU SAVED HER IN GREAT PERPLEXITY THEN I COME TO YOU AND ASK YOU OUT OF YOUR SO MUCH KINDNESS TO TELL ME ALL OF IT THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER
AS TO WHAT POOR LUCY DIED OF NOT AFTER ALL THE HINTS GIVEN NOT ONLY BY EVENTS BUT BY ME OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION FOLLOWING ON GREAT LOSS OR WASTE OF BLOOD
AND SO NOW WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT LEST IT DISTRESS I SHALL STAY IN EXETER TO NIGHT FOR I WANT TO THINK MUCH OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT I WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND THEN TOO
AND THAT SUCH A THING IS HERE IN LONDON IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE WAVED HIS HAND FOR SILENCE AND WENT ON
I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND IT IS NOT THE ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE THAT COULD CLOSE IT BUT THE STRANGE THINGS THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THE THINGS THAT MAKE ONE DOUBT IF THEY BE MAD OR SANE
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT VAN HELSING THINKS HE KNOWS TOO BUT HE WILL ONLY LET OUT ENOUGH AT A TIME TO WHET CURIOSITY HE WENT TO EXETER YESTERDAY AND STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT TO DAY HE CAME BACK AND ALMOST BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK
OR HAD HE SOME CAUSE FOR IT ALL I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW FOR I DARE NOT OPEN THE SUBJECT TO HIM AND YET THAT MAN WE SAW YESTERDAY HE SEEMED QUITE CERTAIN OF HIM POOR FELLOW
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO
IF EVER ABRAHAM VAN HELSING CAN DO ANYTHING FOR YOU OR YOURS I TRUST YOU WILL LET ME KNOW IT WILL BE PLEASURE AND DELIGHT IF I MAY SERVE YOU AS A FRIEND AS A FRIEND BUT ALL I HAVE EVER LEARNED ALL I CAN EVER DO
WE SHALL BOTH COME WHEN YOU WILL I SAID I HAD GOT HIM THE MORNING PAPERS AND THE LONDON PAPERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO START HE WAS TURNING THEM OVER HIS EYES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CATCH SOMETHING IN ONE OF THEM THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE
I SHALL WRITE SO SOON AS EVER I CAN DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER TRULY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FINALITY
SO THAT I MIGHT FAIRLY HAVE SAID THAT THE WOUND WHICH POOR LUCY LEFT ON ME WAS BECOMING CICATRISED EVERYTHING IS HOWEVER NOW REOPENED AND WHAT IS TO BE THE END GOD ONLY KNOWS
IF I HAD NOT READ JONATHAN'S JOURNAL FIRST I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED EVEN A POSSIBILITY POOR POOR DEAR JONATHAN HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED
MINA HARKER JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER I THOUGHT NEVER TO WRITE IN THIS DIARY AGAIN BUT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT MINA HAD SUPPER READY
AND IF THEY BROUGHT HIM ALL THE WAY FROM HOLLAND TO LOOK AFTER LUCY I FEEL FROM HAVING SEEN HIM THAT HE IS GOOD AND KIND AND OF A NOBLE NATURE WHEN HE COMES TO MORROW I SHALL ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN
THAT IS TRUE INDIRECTLY BUT NOT DIRECTLY HOW DO YOU MEAN PROFESSOR I ASKED I WAS A LITTLE INCLINED TO TAKE HIS SERIOUSNESS LIGHTLY FOR AFTER ALL
HE SAID TO ME MISSUS HARKER IS IT NOT I BOWED ASSENT THAT WAS MISS MINA MURRAY AGAIN I ASSENTED IT IS MINA MURRAY THAT I CAME TO SEE THAT WAS FRIEND OF THAT POOR DEAR CHILD LUCY WESTENRA
THE HEAD IS NOBLE WELL SIZED BROAD AND LARGE BEHIND THE EARS THE FACE CLEAN SHAVEN SHOWS A HARD SQUARE CHIN A LARGE RESOLUTE MOBILE MOUTH A GOOD SIZED NOSE RATHER STRAIGHT BUT WITH QUICK SENSITIVE NOSTRILS
I HOPE TOO DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL NOT BLAME ME I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE AND ANXIETY OF LATE THAT I FEEL I CANNOT BEAR MORE JUST AT PRESENT I SUPPOSE A CRY DOES US ALL GOOD AT TIMES
I SUPPOSE SO HE STOOD UP AND SAID SOLEMNLY THEN YOU ARE WRONG OH WOULD IT WERE SO BUT ALAS NO IT IS WORSE FAR FAR WORSE
I DO HOPE THE DEAR FELLOW WILL TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF AND THAT NOTHING WILL OCCUR TO UPSET HIM IT IS TWO O'CLOCK AND THE DOCTOR WILL BE HERE SOON NOW I SHALL SAY NOTHING OF JONATHAN'S JOURNAL
DO I READ YOUR LESSON ARIGHT AH YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE PUPIL STILL IT IS WORTH TO TEACH YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP TO UNDERSTAND
TELL ME I SAID I CAN HAZARD NO OPINION I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND I HAVE NO DATA ON WHICH TO FOUND A CONJECTURE
BUT I HAVE SEEN YOUR TRUE SELF SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR HAND WILL YOU NOT AND LET US BE FRIENDS FOR ALL OUR LIVES WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE WAS SO EARNEST AND SO KIND THAT IT MADE ME QUITE CHOKY
HE TOOK ME BY THE SHOULDER AND TURNED MY FACE ROUND TO THE LIGHT AND SAID AFTER A SHARP SCRUTINY BUT MADAM MINA TOLD ME YOU WERE ILL THAT YOU HAD HAD A SHOCK
SO I PRAY YOU IF IT MAY BE ENLIGHTEN HIM NOT LEST IT MAY HARM AGAIN YOUR PARDON AND FORGIVE ME VAN HELSING TELEGRAM MISSUS HARKER TO VAN HELSING
I WILL PLEDGE MY LIFE ON IT IT MAY BE WORSE FOR OTHERS BUT FOR HIM AND YOU THERE IS NO DREAD HE IS A NOBLE FELLOW AND LET ME TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE OF MEN THAT ONE WHO WOULD DO AS HE DID IN GOING DOWN THAT WALL AND TO THAT ROOM AY AND GOING A SECOND TIME
NOT KNOW YOU I WHO AM OLD AND WHO HAVE STUDIED ALL MY LIFE MEN AND WOMEN I WHO HAVE MADE MY SPECIALTY THE BRAIN AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO HIM AND ALL THAT FOLLOW FROM HIM
BY THE KINDNESS OF LORD GODALMING I AM EMPOWERED TO READ HER LETTERS AND PAPERS FOR I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT CERTAIN MATTERS VITALLY IMPORTANT
AND BEGIN TRANSCRIBING THEN WE SHALL BE READY FOR OTHER EYES IF REQUIRED AND IF IT BE WANTED THEN PERHAPS IF I AM READY POOR JONATHAN MAY NOT BE UPSET FOR I CAN SPEAK FOR HIM
IF IT SHOULD BE AND HE CAME TO LONDON WITH HIS TEEMING MILLIONS THERE MAY BE A SOLEMN DUTY AND IF IT COME WE MUST NOT SHRINK FROM IT I SHALL BE PREPARED I SHALL GET MY TYPEWRITER THIS VERY HOUR
YOU ARE SO GOOD HE SAID AND MAY I READ IT NOW I MAY WANT TO ASK YOU SOME THINGS WHEN I HAVE READ BY ALL MEANS I SAID READ IT OVER WHILST I ORDER LUNCH AND THEN YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS WHILST WE EAT
HE TOOK IT AND SAID TENDERLY OH MADAM MINA I KNEW THAT THE FRIEND OF THAT POOR LILY GIRL MUST BE GOOD BUT I HAD YET TO LEARN HE FINISHED HIS SPEECH WITH A COURTLY BOW
THAT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN EXACTLY ALMOST EVERY WORD SPOKEN EVEN IF YOU HAD TO REFINE SOME OF IT AFTERWARDS HERE WAS A RARE INTERVIEW I SHALL TRY TO RECORD IT VERBATIM
I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU IF YOU LIKE OH MADAM MINA I WILL BE GRATEFUL YOU WILL DO ME MUCH FAVOUR
CLEARS THE AIR AS OTHER RAIN DOES PERHAPS IT WAS READING THE JOURNAL YESTERDAY THAT UPSET ME AND THEN JONATHAN WENT AWAY THIS MORNING TO STAY AWAY FROM ME A WHOLE DAY AND NIGHT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN PARTED SINCE OUR MARRIAGE
AND NOW HE SAID MAY I ASK YOU FOR SOME MORE HELP I HAVE A GREAT TASK TO DO AND AT THE BEGINNING IT IS TO KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME HERE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WENT BEFORE YOUR GOING TO TRANSYLVANIA
AND SO HAD ONLY TO KEEP ON WORKING IN WHAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE GROOVE OF MY LIFE THE GROOVE CEASED TO AVAIL ME AND I MISTRUSTED MYSELF DOCTOR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO DOUBT EVERYTHING EVEN YOURSELF NO
MINA IS DRESSING AND I SHALL CALL AT THE HOTEL IN A FEW MINUTES AND BRING HIM OVER HE WAS I THINK SURPRISED TO SEE ME WHEN I CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
SHALL BE FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE
BUT I SHALL GET THE BUNDLE OF PAPERS YOU CAN TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND READ THEM IN THE TRAIN AFTER BREAKFAST I SAW HIM TO THE STATION WHEN WE WERE PARTING HE SAID
YOU WILL TELL ME OF HUSBAND JONATHAN'S TROUBLE SO FAR AS YOU CAN BUT NOT YET YOU MUST EAT NOW AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL AFTER LUNCH WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM HE SAID TO ME
LET ME ILLUSTRATE I HEARD ONCE OF AN AMERICAN WHO SO DEFINED FAITH THAT FACULTY WHICH ENABLES US TO BELIEVE THINGS WHICH WE KNOW TO BE UNTRUE FOR ONE I FOLLOW THAT MAN
THAT IS THE REASON OF HIS COMING IT IS CONCERNING LUCY AND HER SLEEP WALKING AND NOT ABOUT JONATHAN THEN I SHALL NEVER KNOW THE REAL TRUTH NOW HOW SILLY I AM
AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME MY DEAREST PAPA
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE
AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY
MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AND ALWAYS WELCOME AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER
WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID
SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION MY DEAR
THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION
AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES IT WAS NOON AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
A FEW PERSONS IN THE COSTUME OF THE TIME OF KING HANS PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM HOW STRANGE THEY LOOK THE GOOD FOLKS COME PROBABLY FROM A MASQUERADE
AS ON THE CONTINENT IN ALL LAW AND POLICE PRACTICES NOTHING IS VERBAL BUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER TRIFLING IS REDUCED TO WRITING THE LABOR AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT THUS ACCUMULATE IS ENORMOUS
EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME
MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD SUCH IS MY FATE
MAY ALSO READ THIS LITTLE WORK WE WILL BEFOREHAND GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IT THE EXTENSIVE BUILDING IS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A PRETTY HIGH RAILING THE THICK IRON BARS OF WHICH ARE SO FAR APART THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST ABSENT MAN IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND PEOPLE TOLD THE DROLLEST ANECDOTES ABOUT HIM REFLECTING ON THE MATTER AND WITHOUT LOOKING RIGHT OR LEFT THE COUNCILLOR WENT THROUGH EAST STREET AND ACROSS THE HABRO PLATZ THE BRIDGE LEADING TO PALACE SQUARE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW IT GROWS MUCH WORSE THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO
YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY
EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES
WE WILL JUST STEP OUT INTO THE ANTECHAMBER WHERE CLOAKS MACKINTOSHES STICKS UMBRELLAS AND SHOES WERE DEPOSITED HERE SAT TWO FEMALE FIGURES A YOUNG AND AN OLD ONE ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AT FIRST THEY WERE SERVANTS COME TO ACCOMPANY THEIR MISTRESSES HOME
AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
NOW LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO AMUSE OURSELVES THEY HAD GOT JUST SO FAR AND THE CONVERSATION BEGAN TO CRYSTALLISE AS IT COULD BUT DO WITH THE SCANTY STREAM WHICH THE COMMONPLACE WORLD SUPPLIED AMONGST OTHER THINGS THEY SPOKE OF THE MIDDLE AGES
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BORNHOLMISH DIALECT SAID HE AT LAST ANGRILY AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BRIDGE THERE WAS NO RAILWAY EITHER IT IS REALLY DISGRACEFUL WHAT A STATE THIS PLACE IS IN MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DECENT SHOP FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER NOTHING BUT WRETCHED HUTS CAN I SEE ANYWHERE JUST AS IF I WERE AT RINGSTEAD OH I AM ILL I CAN SCARCELY BEAR MYSELF ANY LONGER WHERE THE DEUCE CAN THE HOUSE BE
WAS A SORT OF HOSTELRY OF THOSE TIMES A KIND OF PUBLIC HOUSE THE ROOM HAD SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE CLAY FLOORED HALLS IN HOLSTEIN A PRETTY NUMEROUS COMPANY CONSISTING OF SEAMEN COPENHAGEN BURGHERS AND A FEW SCHOLARS SAT HERE IN DEEP CONVERSE OVER THEIR PEWTER CANS
THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE WHY THERE IS A PAIR OF GALOSHES AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID THE WATCHMAN AWAKING FROM A GENTLE SLUMBER THEY BELONG NO DOUBT TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY THEY LIE CLOSE TO THE DOOR
THE GOOD OLD SOUL SHE LIVED BEHIND THE EXCHANGE SHE ALWAYS HAD A FEW TWIGS OR GREEN SHOOTS IN WATER LET THE WINTER RAGE WITHOUT AS IT MIGHT THE VIOLETS EXHALED THEIR SWEET BREATH
THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES IMMEDIATELY
FOR IT IS A MOST FOOLISH NOTION TO FANCY A POET DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN AMONG THE LATTER THERE MAY BE FAR MORE POETICAL NATURES THAN MANY AN ACKNOWLEDGED POET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY COULD BOAST OF
HE TURNED ROUND ANEW FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL HE GAZED AT THE STREET FORMERLY SO WELL KNOWN TO HIM AND NOW SO STRANGE IN APPEARANCE AND LOOKED AT THE HOUSES MORE ATTENTIVELY MOST OF THEM WERE OF WOOD SLIGHTLY PUT TOGETHER AND MANY HAD A THATCHED ROOF NO
DOES YOUR HONOR WANT TO CROSS THE FERRY TO THE HOLME ASKED THEY ACROSS TO THE HOLME SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE AT THAT MOMENT WAS NO I AM GOING TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN TO LITTLE MARKET STREET BOTH MEN STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY O HEAVENS
THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED
YET WITHOUT EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OPENLY HE TELLS THE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SET THEM ALL THINKING AND GUESSING BUT IN ORDER TO HURT NOBODY HE WRAPS HIS WITTY ORACULAR JUDGMENTS IN A TRANSPARENT VEIL OR RATHER IN A LURID THUNDERCLOUD SHOOTING FORTH BRIGHT SPARKS OF WIT
THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN
OH MY BLOOD IS MOUNTING TO MY BRAIN TIS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD I SHALL GO WILD I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO OH WERE I BUT LOOSE MY DIZZINESS WOULD THEN CEASE OH WERE MY HEAD BUT LOOSE
TALES OF EVERY DAY LIFE SAID OUR BACHELOR INQUIRINGLY I MEAN THOSE NEW FANGLED NOVELS TWISTING AND WRITHING THEMSELVES IN THE DUST OF COMMONPLACE WHICH ALSO EXPECT TO FIND A READING PUBLIC OH EXCLAIMED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN SMILING
HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME
THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE
AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
SUCH A PAIR OF SHOES MUST BE VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE SAID HE THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND SUPPLE THEY FITTED HIS FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM TIS A CURIOUS WORLD WE LIVE IN CONTINUED HE SOLILOQUIZING
SOME WRETCHED HOVELS FOR THE DUTCH SAILORS RESEMBLING GREAT BOXES AND AFTER WHICH THE PLACE WAS NAMED LAY ABOUT IN CONFUSED DISORDER ON THE OPPOSITE BANK I EITHER BEHOLD A FATA MORGANA OR I AM REGULARLY TIPSY WHIMPERED OUT THE COUNCILLOR BUT WHAT'S THIS
TIS A BITTER CRUST ALAS AT WHICH I AM CONDEMNED TO GNAW NOBODY COULD BE MORE STEADY OR QUIET THAN THIS YOUNG MAN WE THEREFORE WISH HIM JOY OF THE EXCURSION WITH ALL OUR HEART AND
HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD
ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW THE COUNCILLOR ASKED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MUMMERY AND WHO THAT MAN WAS THAT'S THE BISHOP OF ZEALAND WAS THE ANSWER GOOD HEAVENS WHAT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE BISHOP SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR SHAKING HIS HEAD IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE THE BISHOP
BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE OH POOR ME AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND
AND THE TIME CAME AND OFFICER WAS I BUT YET I GREW NOT RICH ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MAN'S WANTS DOST SEE I SAT ONE EVENING SUNK IN DREAMS OF BLISS A MAID OF SEVEN YEARS OLD
BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H C ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES
LONG HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
AND FROM THE GREEN HERBAGE A FRAGRANCE IS EXHALED THAT FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT FOR MANY A YEAR HAVE I NOT FELT AS AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE ALREADY BY THE FOREGOING EFFUSION THAT HE IS BECOME A POET TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF IT HOWEVER WOULD IN MOST CASES BE INSIPID
YES TIS EAST STREET HOW SPLENDID AND LIGHT IT IS BUT REALLY IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT AN EFFECT THAT ONE GLASS OF PUNCH MUST HAVE HAD ON ME
OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT
WAS AGAIN SILENT GREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS COME TO ME
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY
EACH ONE KEPT TO HIS OWN OPINION AND SO THEY SEPARATED IT'S A STRANGE RACE THOSE POETS SAID THE CLERK WHO WAS VERY FOND OF SOLILOQUIZING I SHOULD LIKE SOME DAY JUST FOR A TRIAL TO TAKE SUCH NATURE UPON ME AND BE A POET MYSELF
HE THOUGHT OF THE DISTRESS AND AGONY HE HAD ENDURED AND PRAISED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THE HAPPY REALITY OUR OWN TIME WHICH WITH ALL ITS DEFICIENCIES IS YET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH SO MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION HE HAD LATELY BEEN THREE
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
IT MUST BE HERE ON THIS VERY SPOT YET THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF RESEMBLANCE TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED THIS NIGHT AT ALL EVENTS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UP AND STIRRING OH OH I AM CERTAINLY VERY ILL HE NOW HIT UPON A HALF OPEN DOOR
THE WELL KNOWN GROUP OF THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS
WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE
IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
THEY HOWEVER IMAGINED HE WAS TALKING RUSSIAN NEVER BEFORE HE THOUGHT HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH A COARSE AND IGNORANT COMPANY
OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I
ROME HAS ITS CORSO NAPLES ITS TOLEDO AH THAT ANDERSEN THERE HE IS AGAIN THEY WOULD CRY YET I MUST TO PLEASE MY FANCY CONTINUE QUITE QUIETLY AND ADD
BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS
THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME
AND AS HE GETS ACCUSTOMED TO THE HEAT MOVES TO ANOTHER HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE OF COURSE THE VAPOR IS WARMEST IN THIS MANNER HE ASCENDS GRADUALLY TO THE HIGHEST AND SO THERE HE LAY ON THE UPPERMOST BANK IN THE VAPOR BATH
HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING IT WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR
HE DID SO BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING THE OTHERS REMARKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT THEY LAID HOLD OF HIM BY THE LEGS AND NOW HAPPILY FOR HIM OFF FELL HIS FATAL SHOES AND WITH THEM THE CHARM WAS AT AN END
AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ET CETERA
AND INSTANTLY THROUGH IT SLIPPED EASILY AND WITHOUT PAIN NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THICK BUT NOW THE REST OF THE BODY WAS TO BE GOT THROUGH AH I AM MUCH TOO STOUT GROANED HE ALOUD WHILE FIXED AS IN A VICE
ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED
HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE PRETTY NEARLY AS FOLLOWS A CERTAIN PERSON HAD AN AUNT WHO BOASTED OF PARTICULAR SKILL IN FORTUNE TELLING WITH CARDS AND WHO WAS CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY PERSONS THAT WANTED TO HAVE A PEEP INTO FUTURITY BUT SHE WAS FULL OF MYSTERY ABOUT HER ART
O THOU TO WHOM I DO MY HEART DEVOTE OH READ THIS PAGE OF GLAD DAYS NOW REMOTE A DARK DARK TALE WHICH I TONIGHT DEVOTE DARK IS THE FUTURE NOW ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MEN'S PAINS
THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN
HE SAID TO HIMSELF CONSOLINGLY WHILE HIS EYE RAN OVER THE FIRST PAGE DAME TIGBRITH TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS WHAT IS THAT AND YET IT IS UNDENIABLY MY OWN HANDWRITING HAVE I WRITTEN THE TRAGEDY WONDERFUL VERY WONDERFUL AND THIS WHAT HAVE I HERE
WHAT CHANGE WHAT MAGNIFICENCE YONDER IN THE CANAL LAY THE SHIPS FROZEN UP AND DESERTED BY THEIR WHOLE CREWS WITH A SCREAMING CROW FOR THE SOLE OCCUPANT BUT WHEN THE SPRING WITH A GENTLE STIRRING MOTION ANNOUNCED HER ARRIVAL A NEW AND BUSY LIFE AROSE
THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE FIVE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING CLERK THE WATCHMAN
AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD
THERE IS MUCH WIT IN THEM BESIDES THEY ARE READ AT COURT THE KING LIKES THE HISTORY OF SIR IFFVEN AND SIR GAUDIAN PARTICULARLY WHICH TREATS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE JOKED ABOUT IT WITH HIS HIGH VASSALS I HAVE NOT READ THAT NOVEL SAID THE COUNCILLOR
AS TO A PAVEMENT I CAN FIND NO TRACES OF ONE AND ALL THE LAMPS IT SEEMS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THE MOON WAS NOT YET VERY HIGH IT WAS BESIDES RATHER FOGGY SO THAT IN THE DARKNESS ALL OBJECTS SEEMED MINGLED IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION
SOME ONE OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS NOW SPOKE OF THE DREADFUL PESTILENCE THAT HAD RAGED IN THE COUNTRY A FEW YEARS BACK
IF WITH A WHOLE SKIN HE WERE ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE RAILINGS THERE ON THE FLOOR LAY THE GALOSHES WHICH THE WATCHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN HE NEVER DREAMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF FORTUNE
THAT HE WAS ILL SHE COMPREHENDED DIRECTLY SO SHE BROUGHT HIM A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH TASTED CERTAINLY PRETTY STRONG OF THE SEA ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN FETCHED FROM THE WELL THE COUNCILLOR SUPPORTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND DREW A LONG BREATH AND THOUGHT OVER ALL THE WONDROUS THINGS HE SAW AROUND HIM
WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY
THE COUNCILLOR STOOD STILL AND WATCHED A MOST STRANGE PROCESSION PASS BY FIRST CAME A DOZEN DRUMMERS WHO UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL HOW TO HANDLE THEIR INSTRUMENTS THEN CAME HALBERDIERS AND SOME ARMED WITH CROSS BOWS THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE PROCESSION WAS A PRIEST
SO HE PUT THEM ON THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE WELL THERE HE STOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY
BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
REPLIED CARE IN A SEVERE TONE OF REPROACH NO HE WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY AND WILL ASSUREDLY BLESS THE MOMENT WHEN HE FEELS THAT HE HAS FREED HIMSELF FROM THE FATAL SHOES STUPID NONSENSE SAID THE OTHER ANGRILY
BUT NEVER DEPICT IN ITS DETAIL MISERY AND WANT THAT ANIMAL NECESSITY IN SHORT TO SNATCH AT LEAST AT A FALLEN LEAF OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IF NOT AT THE FRUIT ITSELF THE HIGHER THE POSITION IN WHICH ONE FINDS ONESELF TRANSPLANTED THE GREATER IS THE SUFFERING
WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE
I AM FAR FROM WELL SIGHED HE AND YET I DRANK ONLY ONE GLASS OF PUNCH BUT I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT IT WAS TOO REALLY VERY WRONG TO GIVE US PUNCH AND HOT SALMON FOR SUPPER
THE WORTHY MAN WAS INCLINED TO RING AND DELIVER THEM AT THE HOUSE FOR THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW
SOME PRAISED THAT PERIOD AS FAR MORE INTERESTING FAR MORE POETICAL THAN OUR OWN TOO SOBER PRESENT INDEED COUNCILLOR KNAP DEFENDED THIS OPINION SO WARMLY THAT THE HOSTESS DECLARED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS SIDE AND BOTH EXERTED THEMSELVES WITH UNWEARIED ELOQUENCE
AND GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THE PERSON WHO ENTERED BY YOUR LEAVE SAID THE COUNCILLOR TO THE HOSTESS WHO CAME BUSTLING TOWARDS HIM I'VE FELT SO QUEER ALL OF A SUDDEN WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SEND FOR A HACKNEY COACH TO TAKE ME TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN
THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
BUT THAT THE END OF IT LIKE THE RHINE WAS VERY INSIGNIFICANT PROVED IN HIS OPINION THE AUTHOR'S WANT OF INVENTION HE WAS WITHOUT GENIUS ET CETERA THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SAID SOMETHING CLEVER MEANWHILE HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE IDEA
THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR
IT WAS LATE COUNCILLOR KNAP DEEPLY OCCUPIED WITH THE TIMES OF KING HANS INTENDED TO GO HOME AND MALICIOUS FATE MANAGED MATTERS SO THAT HIS FEET INSTEAD OF FINDING THEIR WAY TO HIS OWN GALOSHES SLIPPED INTO THOSE OF FORTUNE
DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT
SOME ONE WILL MAKE A MISTAKE FOR CERTAIN AND TAKE THE WRONG ONES HE WILL BE A HAPPY MAN SUCH WAS THEIR CONVERSATION TWO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILLOR
I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION A SORT OF BAZAR
SO YOU ARE GOING AWAY AGAIN SAID THE CLERK YOU ARE A VERY FREE AND HAPPY BEING WE OTHERS ARE CHAINED BY THE LEG AND HELD FAST TO OUR DESK YES BUT IT IS A CHAIN FRIEND WHICH ENSURES YOU THE BLESSED BREAD OF EXISTENCE ANSWERED THE POET
THEY TOOK HOLD OF THE WORTHY MAN WHO HEARING ON EVERY SIDE THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED
ONE MUST HAVE MORE THAN THE EYE OF A SHOEMAKER TO KNOW ONE PAIR FROM THE OTHER SAID HE SOLILOQUIZING AND PUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THE GALOSHES IN SEARCH OF AN OWNER BESIDE HIS OWN IN THE CORNER HERE SIR SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO PANTING BROUGHT HIM A TREMENDOUS PILE OF PAPERS
AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT
BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN
WOULD JOIN THEM OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOULD GREET HIM WITH A WILD HURRAH WHILE HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PILLORY THERE WOULD BE A MOB A HISSING AND REJOICING AND JEERING TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IN THE ROWS ABOUT THE JEWS SOME YEARS AGO
ON WHICH ACCOUNT HIS FOOT VERY NATURALLY SANK IN THE MUD AND PUDDLES OF THE STREET THERE HAVING BEEN IN THOSE DAYS NO PAVEMENT IN COPENHAGEN WELL THIS IS TOO BAD HOW DIRTY IT IS HERE SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR
WITH SONGS AND HURRAHS THE ICE WAS SAWN ASUNDER THE SHIPS WERE FRESH TARRED AND RIGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SAIL AWAY TO DISTANT LANDS BUT I HAVE REMAINED HERE
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
WHICH I AM TO CARRY TO MANKIND THESE SHOES POSSESS THE PROPERTY OF INSTANTLY TRANSPORTING HIM WHO HAS THEM ON TO THE PLACE OR THE PERIOD IN WHICH HE MOST WISHES TO BE EVERY WISH AS REGARDS TIME OR PLACE OR STATE OF BEING WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FULFILLED AND SO AT LAST MAN WILL BE HAPPY HERE BELOW
WITH A SICK BED RID MOTHER REVEALED BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER BOXES ON THE ROOF
HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR
YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL
THAT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DREAM SAID HE BUT TWAS DROLL ENOUGH ALTOGETHER
THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE INFORMED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE PEOPLE TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT AND IN THE MORNING THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE HOSPITAL NOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY JOKE IF THE SPIRIT WHEN IT CAME BACK AND LOOKED FOR THE BODY IN EAST STREET WERE NOT TO FIND ONE
OH WERE I RICH OH WERE I RICH SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH OH WERE I RICH AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH
HE HAD ON THE SHOES FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT OF DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE
AT ALL EVENTS IT MUST BE THOSE WHICH ARE WET THOUGHT HE BUT THIS TIME IN SPITE OF HIS CLEVERNESS HE GUESSED QUITE WRONG
THE COPYING CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
WE ARE DOING THIS FOR MY FATHER WHO NATURALLY DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING THROWN AWAY HE MAKES THAT INTO DUBBIN SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE FRAGMENT ON THE GRASS WHAT MADE EITHER OF THE OTHERS THROW IT I WONDER
PUT ABOUT TWO POUNDS IN A PAN STIR IT A FEW TIMES IT WILL ROAST GRADUALLY AND IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY BROWN FINISH IN A STOVE OR BEFORE THE FIRE
FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG BUT HAD SOMEHOW BEEN DIVIDED FROM HIS ACTUAL BREATHING AS BY A SHEET OF GLASS THE INTENTIONS AS TO READING WORKING AND LEARNING WHICH HE HAD SO PRECISELY FORMULATED ONLY A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
MANY PERSONS USE COFFEE ROASTERS BUT SOME OLD EXPERIENCED HOUSEKEEPERS THINK THAT THE FINE FLAVOR FLIES OFF MORE THAN WHEN DONE IN A DUTCH OVEN AND CONSTANTLY STIRRED IF YOU ARE CAREFUL IT CAN BE DONE VERY WELL IN THE DRIPPING PAN OF A STOVE
IT WAS THEN VERY SWEET AND GOOD IT WILL NOT DO TO USE FOR A MONTH BECAUSE EARLIER THE SALTS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY BLENDED WITH IT IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN WOODEN VESSELS OR NICE STONE JARS EARTHEN WARE JARS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR BUTTER
IF YOU HAVE A SAFE TO KEEP IT IN IT NEED NOT BE COVERED CREAM TAKES MUCH LONGER TO RISE IN WINTER AFTER IT HAS STOOD TWO DAYS TO PUT IT ON THE TOP OF A MODERATELY HEATED STOVE WILL ASSIST IT WHEN IT IS HOT SET IT AWAY TO SKIM THE NEXT DAY
OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
NO MORE NO LESS AND JUDE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO HER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE THE ENTERPRISE OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM DREAMS OF THE HUMANER LETTERS TO WHAT WAS SIMMERING IN THE MINDS AROUND HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE TOLD
HE INCLINED TO THEY BUILT IN A CITY THEREFORE HE WOULD LEARN TO BUILD HE THOUGHT OF HIS UNKNOWN UNCLE HIS COUSIN SUSANNA'S FATHER AN ECCLESIASTICAL WORKER IN METAL AND SOMEHOW
IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BY USING SEVERAL PANS SIX POUNDS OF COFFEE CAN THUS BE ROASTED AND BUT LITTLE TIME SPENT ON IT BOILING COFFEE A LARGE TEA CUPFUL OF UNGROUND COFFEE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIX PERSONS
YOU MAY MAKE CHEESE TWICE A WEEK AND STILL HAVE BUTTER FOR THE FAMILY YOU SHOULD KEEP FOUR THIN CLOTHS ON PURPOSE FOR CHEESE PENNSYLVANIA CREAM CHEESE THE CHEESE CALLED BY THIS NAME IS NOT IN REALITY MADE OF CREAM
THE ONLY COPIES HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAY HANDS ON WERE OLD DELPHIN EDITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERSEDED AND THEREFORE CHEAP
AND THEY SHOULD BE PAINTED ON THE OUTSIDE TO KEEP THEM FROM RUSTING WHEN THEY ARE PUT IN WATER IN SUMMER MILK SHOULD BE KEPT AS COOL AS POSSIBLE BEFORE IT IS STRAINED THE PANS AND STRAINER SHOULD BE RINSED WITH COLD WATER AND THE MILK NOT COVERED UNTIL IT IS COLD
CERTAINLY THERE SEEMED LITTLE HARMONY BETWEEN THIS PAGAN LITERATURE AND THE MEDIAEVAL COLLEGES AT CHRISTMINSTER THAT ECCLESIASTICAL ROMANCE IN STONE
TO BEGUILE HIS LONELY WALKS BY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS THEREIN I HAVE READ TWO BOOKS OF THE ILIAD BESIDES BEING PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE SPEECH OF PHOENIX IN THE NINTH BOOK THE FIGHT OF HECTOR AND AJAX IN THE FOURTEENTH
TWENTY SIX
PIGS WERE RATHER PLENTIFUL HEREABOUT BEING BRED AND FATTENED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF NORTH WESSEX ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WAS A STREAM WHENCE AS HE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZED HAD COME THE SLIGHT SOUNDS OF VOICES AND LAUGHTER
AND STIRRED IN THE COFFEE WHEN HALF COLD AND WELL MIXED THROUGH IT ARE SUFFICIENT TO CLEAR TWO POUNDS AND IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY OF USING EGGS IT WILL ANSWER EITHER FOR SUMMER OR WINTER
USE ONE OUNCE OF THIS COMPOSITION TO EVERY POUND OF BUTTER WORK IT WELL INTO THE MASS BUTTER CURED IN THIS WAY IT IS SAID WILL KEEP GOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE NEVER KEPT IT LONGER THAN FROM THE FALL UNTIL LATE IN THE SPRING
AN AGED HORSE WITH A HANGING HEAD HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR EIGHT POUNDS AT A SALE A CREAKING CART WITH A WHITY BROWN TILT OBTAINED FOR A FEW POUNDS MORE AND IN THIS TURN OUT IT BECAME JUDE'S BUSINESS THRICE A WEEK TO CARRY LOAVES OF BREAD TO THE VILLAGERS
WHEN HE CONSIDERED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE NOW AND THEN AS HE WENT ALONG HE TURNED TO FACE THE PEEPS OF COUNTRY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM BUT HE HARDLY SAW THEM THE ACT WAS AN AUTOMATIC REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN LESS OCCUPIED
PUT A WEIGHT ON THE TOP HEAVY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE WHEY DRAIN OUT GRADUALLY IN SIX OR SEVEN HOURS IT WILL BE READY TO TAKE OUT OF THE PRESS WHEN RUB IT OVER WITH FINE SALT SET IT IN A DRY DARK PLACE CHANGE IT FROM ONE PLATE TO ANOTHER TWICE A DAY
AS JUDE HAD TO GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO HEAT THE OVEN AND MIX AND SET IN THE BREAD THAT HE DISTRIBUTED LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAYING THE SPONGE SO THAT IF HE COULD NOT READ HIS CLASSICS ON THE HIGHWAYS
WHEN PUT ON THE TOP A SMALL MUSLIN BAG FILLED WITH SALT AND TIE THE JAR UP CLOSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE BUTTER IN A COOL PLACE A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON THE BUTTER BEING WELL WORKED PERSONS THAT HAVE LARGE DAIRIES SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MACHINE TO WORK IT
AS BY THE LIGHT OF A FALLING LAMP ONE MIGHT MOMENTARILY SEE AN INSCRIPTION ON A WALL BEFORE BEING ENSHROUDED IN DARKNESS AND THEN THIS PASSING DISCRIMINATIVE POWER WAS WITHDRAWN
IT SHOULD BE PUT ON LITTLE PLATES AND EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER TO EXCLUDE THE AIR IF THE BUTTER IS GOOD WHEN PUT UP IN THE FALL IT WILL KEEP TILL YOU CAN GET GRASS BUTTER IN THE SPRING THE JARS FOR THIS PURPOSE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED FOR PICKLES
AND REPEATING THE ODD LITTLE SUCKING OPERATION BEFORE MENTIONED JUDE BEING STILL UNCONSCIOUS OF MORE THAN A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER APPEARANCE NEXT SUNDAY HE HAZARDED TO MORROW THAT IS YES
INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERY THING CONNECTED WITH MILK AND BUTTER SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN IF THE MILK ACQUIRES AN UNPLEASANT TASTE IT COMMUNICATES IT TO THE BUTTER TIN PANS ARE BEST TO KEEP MILK IN
AS ANOTHER OUTCOME OF THIS CHANGE OF GROOVE HE VISITED ON SUNDAYS ALL THE CHURCHES WITHIN A WALK AND DECIPHERED THE LATIN INSCRIPTIONS ON FIFTEENTH CENTURY BRASSES AND TOMBS ON ONE OF THESE PILGRIMAGES
PUT MORE ON IN TWO DAYS KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT WILL DO TO STRETCH ON STICKS HANG IT UP IN A DRY COOL PLACE WITH AS MUCH SALT AS WILL STICK TO IT WHEN QUITE DRY PUT IT IN A PAPER BAG AND HANG IT UP
AND JUST COME TO A BOIL STIR IT AND DO NOT LET IT BOIL OVER LET IT KEEP AT BOILING HEAT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE AND PUT IN HALF A TEA CUP OF WATER TO SETTLE IT LET IT STAND FIVE MINUTES AND POUR IT OFF
I DIDN'T THROW IT I TELL YOU ASSERTED ONE GIRL TO HER NEIGHBOUR AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE NOR I THE SECOND ANSWERED OH ANNY HOW CAN YOU SAID THE THIRD
MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
HE STOPPED THE HORSE ALIGHTED AND GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS IN SIGHT KNELT DOWN ON THE ROADSIDE BANK WITH OPEN BOOK HE TURNED FIRST TO THE SHINY GODDESS WHO SEEMED TO LOOK SO SOFTLY AND CRITICALLY AT HIS DOINGS
THREE THE MASTER SAID
AT THIS MEMORABLE DATE OF HIS LIFE HE WAS ONE SATURDAY RETURNING FROM ALFREDSTON TO MARYGREEN ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS FINE WARM AND SOFT SUMMER WEATHER AND HE WALKED WITH HIS TOOLS AT HIS BACK
SPRINGING TO HER FEET SHE SAID BRING BACK WHAT IS LYING THERE JUDE WAS NOW AWARE THAT NO MESSAGE ON ANY MATTER CONNECTED WITH HER FATHER'S BUSINESS HAD PROMPTED HER SIGNAL TO HIM HE SET DOWN HIS BASKET OF TOOLS
AND I'LL BE HER BELOVED SON IN WHOM SHE SHALL BE WELL PLEASED IN HIS DEEP CONCENTRATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUTURE JUDE'S WALK HAD SLACKENED AND HE WAS NOW STANDING QUITE STILL
SHALL WELCOME WHOM NOW IT WOULD SPURN IF I WAIT TWENTY YEARS FOR THE WELCOME I'LL BE D D BEFORE I HAVE DONE
TILL HE PRENTICED HIMSELF AT ALFREDSTON SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN VERY STUCK UP AND ALWAYS READING HE WANTS TO BE A SCHOLAR THEY SAY OH I DON'T CARE WHAT HE IS OR ANYTHING ABOUT N DON'T YOU THINK IT MY CHILD OH DON'T YE
AND INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE CONSTABLE'S DUTY TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT AND TAKE HIM TO THE POLICE COURT AT ALFREDSTON AND GET HIM FINED FOR DANGEROUS PRACTICES ON THE HIGHWAY THE POLICEMAN THEREUPON LAY IN WAIT FOR JUDE AND ONE DAY ACCOSTED HIM AND CAUTIONED HIM
IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTINACIES AS HE NOW KNEW THEM INHERENTLY TO POSSESS WAS A HERCULEAN PERFORMANCE WHICH GRADUALLY LED HIM ON TO A GREATER INTEREST IN IT THAN IN THE PRESUPPOSED PATENT PROCESS
THAT TILL THIS MOMENT JUDE HAD NEVER LOOKED AT A WOMAN TO CONSIDER HER AS SUCH BUT HAD VAGUELY REGARDED THE SEX AS BEINGS OUTSIDE HIS LIFE AND PURPOSES HE GAZED FROM HER EYES TO HER MOUTH THENCE TO HER BOSOM AND TO HER FULL ROUND NAKED ARMS
WHAT DID YOU STAY TALKING TO HIM FOR IF YOU DIDN'T WANT UN WHETHER YOU DO OR WHETHER YOU DON'T HE'S AS SIMPLE AS A CHILD
LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS THOUGH THE FUTURE WERE THROWN THEREON BY A MAGIC LANTERN ON A SUDDEN SOMETHING SMACKED HIM SHARPLY IN THE EAR AND HE BECAME AWARE THAT A SOFT COLD SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN FLUNG AT HIM
CH'ANG IS PASSIONATE HOW CAN HE BE FIRM ELEVEN TZU KUNG SAID
MENG WU ASKED WHETHER TZU LU HAD LOVE
WHOEVER DID IT WAS WASTEFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY OH THAT'S NOTHING BUT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME I SUPPOSE OH YES IF YOU LIKE TO
IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
SHE SAID PIQUANTLY I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HE ANSWERED THAT'S FOR YOU TO THINK ON THERE'S NOBODY AFTER ME JUST NOW THOUGH THERE MED BE IN A WEEK OR TWO SHE HAD SPOKEN THIS WITHOUT A SMILE AND THE DIMPLES DISAPPEARED
A LARGE CHURNING MAY BE MORE EFFECTUALLY CLEARED OF THE BUTTER MILK IN A FEW MINUTES THAN IN THE OLD WAY IN AN HOUR BY DOING IT QUICKLY IT DOES NOT GET SOFT AND OILY IN HOT WEATHER A PICKLE FOR BUTTER
BY MEANS OF A STRAP ATTACHED TO THE TILT THE VOLUME HE WAS READING SPREAD THE DICTIONARY ON HIS KNEES AND PLUNGE INTO THE SIMPLER PASSAGES FROM CAESAR VIRGIL OR HORACE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE IN HIS PURBLIND STUMBLING WAY
ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO
AND HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET A GLANCE TOLD HIM WHAT IT WAS A PIECE OF FLESH THE CHARACTERISTIC PART OF A BARROW PIG WHICH THE COUNTRYMEN USED FOR GREASING THEIR BOOTS AS IT WAS USELESS FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
ONE GOOD WORKING ANSWERS VERY WELL FOR BUTTER IN WINTER ALWAYS SCALD THE CHURN BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM IN COLD WEATHER TO PUT UP BUTTER FOR WINTER WORK IT WELL AND SALT IT RATHER MORE THAN FOR TABLE USE
WHEN THE PICKLE IS ENTIRELY COLD POUR IT OVER AND PUT A PLATE ON THE TOP WITH A WEIGHT ON IT TO KEEP THE BUTTER UNDER TIE IT UP CLOSE AND KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE WHEN A ROLL IS WANTED TAKE IT OUT OF THE BAG AND SLICE IT OFF FOR TABLE USE
SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU DO ARABELLA DONN I'M LIVING HERE I MUST HAVE KNOWN IT IF I HAD OFTEN COME THIS WAY BUT I MOSTLY GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MY FATHER IS A PIG BREEDER
THE SAME PIECE SALTED AND DRIED WILL DO SEVERAL TIMES COTTAGE CHEESE OR SMEARCASE
I ONLY KNOW THE LETTERS AS YET HOITY TOITY BUT I CAN WORK HARD I HAVE STAYING POWER IN ABUNDANCE THANK GOD AND IT IS THAT WHICH TELLS YES CHRISTMINSTER SHALL BE MY ALMA MATER
WASH AND WIPE THE VAT PUT IN A CLEAN CLOTH AND TURN IN THE CHEESE UPSIDE DOWN
BEGIN BY PUTTING A LAYER OF THE PRINTS IN THE BOTTOM OF A STONE POT PRESS THE BUTTER DOWN CLOSE SO THAT NO CAVITIES FOR THE ADMISSION OF AIR MAY REMAIN THEN STREW MORE OF THE MIXTURE OVER IT PROCEED IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE VESSEL IS FILLED
THAT HAD MINGLED WITH HIS DREAMS HE MOUNTED THE BANK AND LOOKED OVER THE FENCE ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM STOOD A SMALL HOMESTEAD HAVING A GARDEN AND PIG STIES ATTACHED IN FRONT OF IT BESIDE THE BROOK
AND JUDE WAS LOST TO ALL CONDITIONS OF THINGS IN THE ADVENT OF A FRESH AND WILD PLEASURE THAT OF HAVING FOUND A NEW CHANNEL FOR EMOTIONAL INTEREST HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THOUGH IT HAD LAIN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
AND IT WILL BE FIT FOR USE IN LESS THAN A WEEK TO PREPARE RENNET FOR MAKING WHEY OR CHEESE WHEN THE RENNET IS TAKEN FROM THE CALF WASH IT LAY IT ON A PLATE WELL COVERED WITH SALT
WHEN IT BOILS STIR IN A HEAPED TABLE SPOONFUL OF THE ABOVE PREPARATION DISSOLVED IN A TEA CUP OF WATER KEEP STIRRING IT UNTIL IT BOILS AGAIN WHEN POUR IT OUT DRINK IT WITH SUGAR AND CREAM TO YOUR TASTE
AND LIVE SUMPTUOUSLY FOR HIM ON THE REMAINDER WELL ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BISHOP WAS ABSURD HE WOULD DRAW THE LINE AT AN ARCHDEACON
IT IS BEST TO HAVE ONE KETTLE OR BASKET TO PUT THE BUTTER IN THAT IS USED AT THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD FIVE OR SIX PLATES EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER IT CAN BE KEPT IN THIS WAY AS FIRM AND SWEET AS IN AN ICE HOUSE
FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AN INCOME FROM ANY WORK IN PREPARING THE FIRST WOULD BE TOO MEAGRE FOR MAKING THE SECOND HE FELT A DISTASTE
PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
TWENTY SEVEN
AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT BECOME EVEN A BISHOP BY LEADING A PURE ENERGETIC WISE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE WOULD SET
HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
PLATO ARISTOTLE LUCRETIUS EPICTETUS SENECA ANTONINUS THEN I MUST MASTER OTHER THINGS THE FATHERS THOROUGHLY
I HAVE ACQUIRED QUITE AN AVERAGE STUDENT'S POWER TO READ THE COMMON ANCIENT CLASSICS LATIN IN PARTICULAR
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
AS DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SALTS THEY CORRODE THE GLAZING AND THE BUTTER BECOMES RANCID AND UNHEALTHY A FRIEND OF MINE AND A LADY OF MUCH EXPERIENCE REMARKED ON READING THE ABOVE
WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING PUT IT IN THE TUB WITH THE NEW MILK AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT'S MILK IT SHOULD BE RATHER MORE THAN MILK WARM
AND A LOT OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT I WISH THERE WAS ONLY ONE DIALECT ALL THE SAME I HAVE DONE SOME MATHEMATICS INCLUDING THE FIRST SIX AND THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH BOOKS OF EUCLID AND ALGEBRA AS FAR AS SIMPLE EQUATIONS I KNOW SOMETHING OF THE FATHERS
WHICH WAS UTTERED VERY DISTINCTLY BY ARABELLA'S PERSONALITY HELD JUDE TO THE SPOT AGAINST HIS INTENTION ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL AND IN A WAY NEW TO HIS EXPERIENCE IT IS SCARCELY AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
HAVING PROMISED TO CALL AT A FLOUR MILL NEAR CRESSCOMBE TO EXECUTE A COMMISSION FOR HIS AUNT HE WAS IN AN ENTHUSIASTIC MOOD HE SEEMED TO SEE HIS WAY TO LIVING COMFORTABLY IN CHRISTMINSTER IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO AND KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF ONE OF THOSE STRONGHOLDS OF LEARNING
IF YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KEEPING YOUR CREAM COOL IN HOT WEATHER IT OUGHT TO BE CHURNED TWICE A WEEK THE EARLIER IN THE MORNING THE BETTER ALWAYS PUT COLD WATER IN YOUR CHURN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU USE IT AND CHANGE IT IN THE MORNING JUST BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM
WHEN THE CREAM WILL BE THICK AND RICH AND CHURNS EASIER IF THE WEATHER IS VERY COLD AND THE CREAM HAS BEEN CHILLED HAVE A LARGE POT OF WATER OVER THE FIRE SET IN THE BUCKET WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING HEAT AND KEEP STIRRING TILL IT IS MILK WARM HAVE THE CHURN SCALDED AND PUT IT IN
THE MOUNTAIN WEIGHT OF MATERIAL UNDER WHICH THE IDEAS LAY IN THOSE DUSTY VOLUMES CALLED THE CLASSICS PIQUED HIM INTO A DOGGED MOUSELIKE SUBTLETY OF ATTEMPT TO MOVE IT PIECEMEAL
SPREAD A THIN LINEN CLOTH OVER THE TOP AND AS THE WHEY RISES DIP IT OFF WITH A SAUCER PUT THE CURD AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE INTO A CHEESE HOOP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DINNER PLATE FIRST SPREADING A WET CLOTH INSIDE THEN FOLD THE CLOTH SMOOTHLY OVER THE TOP
TO THREE GALLONS OF WATER ADD FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS OF GOOD BROWN SUGAR ONE AND A HALF OUNCES OF SALTPETRE ONE OUNCE OF SALAERATUS PUT THEM INTO AN IRON POT AND LET THEM COME TO A BOIL TAKE OFF THE SCUM WHEN COLD IT IS READY FOR USE
UNLESS THEY TAKE IT VERY STRONG WHICH IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH GRIND IT AND PUT IT IN THE TIN POT WITH HALF A TEA CUP OF COLD WATER AND THE WHITE OF HALF AN EGG SHAKE IT TILL IT IS MIXED THEN POUR BOILING WATER ON IT AND LET IT STAND CLOSE TO THE FIRE
A MAN BEGGED HIM FOR VINEGAR
WHEN THE BUTTER IS GATHERING TAKE OFF THE LID OF THE CHURN TO LET THE HEATED AIR ESCAPE AND MOVE IT GENTLY HAVE YOUR BUTTER LADLE AND PAN SCALDED AND COOLED TAKE OUT THE BUTTER AND WORK IT TILL ALL THE MILK IS OUT SCRAPE SOME LUMPS OF SALT AND WORK IN
AND SOMETHING OF ROMAN AND ENGLISH HISTORY THESE THINGS ARE ONLY A BEGINNING BUT I SHALL NOT MAKE MUCH FARTHER ADVANCE HERE FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING BOOKS HENCE I MUST NEXT CONCENTRATE ALL MY ENERGIES ON SETTLING IN CHRISTMINSTER
THE MASTER SAID LOVE MAKES A SPOT BEAUTIFUL WHO CHOOSES NOT TO DWELL IN LOVE HAS HE GOT WISDOM TWO THE MASTER SAID LOVELESS MEN CANNOT BEAR NEED LONG THEY CANNOT BEAR FORTUNE LONG
AND THAT HE WAS WATCHING THEM THEY BRACED THEMSELVES FOR INSPECTION BY PUTTING THEIR MOUTHS DEMURELY INTO SHAPE AND RECOMMENCING THEIR RINSING OPERATIONS WITH ASSIDUITY THANK YOU SAID JUDE SEVERELY
WAS A NOT UNKNOWN OPERATION WHICH MANY ATTEMPTED BUT ONLY A FEW SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THEY MET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLANK AND JUDE TOSSING BACK HER MISSILE SEEMED TO EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAD AUDACIOUSLY STOPPED HIM BY THIS NOVEL ARTILLERY
JUDE ASKED POLITELY ACCEPTING HER ASSERTION THOUGH HE HAD VERY LARGE DOUBTS AS TO ITS TRUTH IMPUDENCE DON'T TELL FOLK IT WAS I MIND HOW CAN I I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME AH NO
SHALL I CALL YES SHE BRIGHTENED WITH A LITTLE GLOW OF TRIUMPH SWEPT HIM ALMOST TENDERLY WITH HER EYES IN TURNING AND RETRACING HER STEPS DOWN THE BROOKSIDE GRASS REJOINED HER COMPANIONS
ONCE THERE I SHALL SO ADVANCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE I SHALL THERE GET THAT MY PRESENT KNOWLEDGE WILL APPEAR TO ME BUT AS CHILDISH IGNORANCE I MUST SAVE MONEY AND I WILL AND ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES SHALL OPEN ITS DOORS TO ME
AND WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF LABOUR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A TENDER HEARTED PEDAGOGUE SHED TEARS YET SOMEHOW GETTING AT THE MEANING OF WHAT HE READ AND DIVINING RATHER THAN BEHOLDING THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL
SHE BROUGHT AS BY MAGIC UPON ITS SMOOTH AND ROTUND SURFACE A PERFECT DIMPLE WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THERE AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE THIS PRODUCTION OF DIMPLES AT WILL
A LAND OF A THOUSAND CHARIOTS MIGHT GIVE YU CHARGE OF ITS LEVIES
OR IN A POT OF WATER THAT IS BOILING OVER THE FIRE WHEN THE WHEY HAS RISEN SUFFICIENTLY POUR IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND PUT THE CURD OR CHEESE AWAY IN A COLD PLACE AND JUST BEFORE GOING TO TABLE SEASON IT WITH SALT AND PEPPER TO YOUR TASTE AND POUR SOME SWEET CREAM OVER IT
AS A WOMAN IS SINGLED OUT IN SUCH CASES FOR NO REASONED PURPOSE OF FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE BUT IN COMMONPLACE OBEDIENCE TO CONJUNCTIVE ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS
THEN TO THE DISAPPEARING LUMINARY ON THE OTHER HAND AS HE BEGAN PHOEBE
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE TOLERABLE TO HIS CRUSTY MAIDEN AUNT BY ASSISTING HER TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY AND THE BUSINESS OF THE LITTLE COTTAGE BAKERY HAD GROWN IN CONSEQUENCE
IT HAD BEEN NO VESTAL WHO CHOSE THAT MISSILE FOR OPENING HER ATTACK ON HIM HE SAW THIS WITH HIS INTELLECTUAL EYE JUST FOR A SHORT FLEETING WHILE
THREE YOUNG WOMEN WERE KNEELING WITH BUCKETS AND PLATTERS BESIDE THEM CONTAINING HEAPS OF PIGS CHITTERLINGS WHICH THEY WERE WASHING IN THE RUNNING WATER
BUT CAPABLE OF PASSING AS SUCH AT A LITTLE DISTANCE DESPITE SOME COARSENESS OF SKIN AND FIBRE SHE HAD A ROUND AND PROMINENT BOSOM FULL LIPS PERFECT TEETH AND THE RICH COMPLEXION OF A COCHIN HEN'S EGG SHE WAS A COMPLETE AND SUBSTANTIAL FEMALE ANIMAL
THOUGH PROBABLY CONVENIENT ENOUGH TO HIMSELF WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A SAFE PROCEEDING FOR OTHER TRAVELLERS ALONG THE SAME ROADS THERE WERE MURMURS
ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IMPROVED BY IT BEFORE POURING OUT TEA IT SHOULD BE STIRRED WITH A SPOON THAT THE STRENGTH OF EACH CUP MAY BE ALIKE MILK IS THE BEST DRINK FOR CHILDREN BUT IF THAT CANNOT BE HAD SWEETENED WATER WITH A LITTLE MILK WILL DO
AN ADROIT LITTLE SUCK TO THE INTERIOR OF EACH OF HER CHEEKS IN SUCCESSION
WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
THE MASTER SAID A MAN AND HIS FAULTS ARE OF A PIECE BY WATCHING HIS FAULTS WE LEARN WHETHER LOVE BE HIS EIGHT THE MASTER SAID
OR HATE OTHERS FOUR THE MASTER SAID
AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
BUTTER CHEESE COFFEE TEA
THE APPEARANCE OF ACHILLES UNARMED AND HIS HEAVENLY ARMOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE FUNERAL GAMES IN THE TWENTY THIRD
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
MY EYES LIT UPON A BLACK FACE WATCHING ME I SAW THAT IT WAS THE SIMIAN CREATURE WHO HAD MET THE LAUNCH UPON THE BEACH HE WAS CLINGING TO THE OBLIQUE STEM OF A PALM TREE I GRIPPED MY STICK AND STOOD UP FACING HIM
WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
ONE DAY TWO WILD LOOKING YOUNG MEN CAME OUT OF A TAVERN CLOSE BY THE STAND AND CALLED JERRY HERE CABBY LOOK SHARP WE ARE RATHER LATE PUT ON THE STEAM WILL YOU AND TAKE US TO THE VICTORIA IN TIME FOR THE ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN
TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
THEY WERE ALWAYS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR JERRY WOULD SAY IF YOU IN THE MORNING THROW MINUTES AWAY YOU CAN'T PICK THEM UP IN THE COURSE OF A DAY YOU MAY HURRY AND SCURRY AND FLURRY AND WORRY YOU'VE LOST THEM FOREVER FOREVER AND AYE
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
IT IS A WELL PROPORTIONED RATHER HANDSOME TREE WITH GRAYISH BROWN BARK AND CROOKED MUCH DIVIDED BRANCHES WHICH COVER THE GREATER PART OF THE TRUNK BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
THERE I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME TOO FEARFUL TO MOVE AND INDEED TOO FEARFUL EVEN TO PLAN A COURSE OF ACTION THE WILD SCENE ABOUT ME LAY SLEEPING SILENTLY UNDER THE SUN
AND YOU WON'T FIND A CURSE COME WITH YOUR WEALTH AS FOR YOU LARRY YOU'LL DIE POOR YOU SPEND TOO MUCH IN WHIPCORD WELL SAID LARRY WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO IF HIS HORSE WON'T GO WITHOUT IT
JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
OMNIBUSES CARTS VANS TRUCKS CABS AND GREAT WAGONS CREEPING ALONG AT A WALKING PACE SOME GOING ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER SOME GOING SLOWLY OTHERS WANTING TO PASS THEM OMNIBUSES STOPPING SHORT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO TAKE UP A PASSENGER
ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I SHALL BE THE LESS HAPPY FOR THAT I HAVE HEARD THE COMMANDMENTS READ A GREAT MANY TIMES AND I NEVER NOTICED THAT ANY OF THEM SAID THOU SHALT BE RICH AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CURIOUS THINGS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT RICH MEN
I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
FOR THERE WAS A WHOLE TRAIN OF CABS AND CARRIAGES ALL GOING OUR WAY AT A QUICK TROT PERHAPS WANTING TO CATCH THAT VERY TRAIN AT ANY RATE WE WHIRLED INTO THE STATION WITH MANY MORE JUST AS THE GREAT CLOCK POINTED TO EIGHT MINUTES TO TWELVE O'CLOCK
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
PREACHING TO US AND THEN DOING THE SAME HIMSELF LOOK HERE MATES SAID JERRY THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED ME HALF A CROWN EXTRA BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT TWAS QUITE PAY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE HOW GLAD HE WAS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
AND SO THEY DID HARRY WAS AS CLEVER AT STABLE WORK AS A MUCH OLDER BOY AND ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT HE COULD THEN POLLY AND DOLLY USED TO COME IN THE MORNING TO HELP WITH THE CAB TO BRUSH AND BEAT THE CUSHIONS
A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN I GENERALLY GET SAID HE NODDING SLYLY WHAT HE GAVE ME WILL KEEP ME IN LITTLE COMFORTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS GAMMON SAID ONE HE'S A HUMBUG SAID ANOTHER
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
HE BEGAN CHATTERING YOU YOU YOU WAS ALL I COULD DISTINGUISH AT FIRST SUDDENLY HE DROPPED FROM THE TREE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS HOLDING THE FRONDS APART AND STARING CURIOUSLY AT ME
WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
GOOD LUCK IS RATHER PARTICULAR WHO SHE RIDES WITH AND MOSTLY PREFERS THOSE WHO HAVE GOT COMMON SENSE AND A GOOD HEART AT LEAST THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE GOVERNOR GRAY TURNED ROUND AGAIN TO HIS NEWSPAPER
HAD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE LAYERS OF WOOD BEYOND THIS THE COUNT WAS STOPPED BY DRY ROT AND SCARS THE LARGEST EXAMINED WAS THIRTY THREE FEET IN GIRTH OR NEARLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAILED TO GET ANYTHING LIKE A COMPLETE COUNT
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
THE TWO LEAVED PINE THE TWO LEAVED PINE PINUS CONTORTA
AND DREW UP ON ONE SIDE TILL THE CRUSH WAS PAST SO GLAD HE SAID SO GLAD POOR YOUNG FELLOW I WONDER WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE HIM SO ANXIOUS JERRY OFTEN TALKED TO HIMSELF QUITE LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
DRAW NEARER AND YELP WHEN IT CAME TO THE THORNS THEN I HEARD NO MORE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN TO THINK I HAD ESCAPED THE MINUTES PASSED THE SILENCE LENGTHENED OUT AND AT LAST AFTER AN HOUR OF SECURITY MY COURAGE BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME
AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
AND AS THEY LED HIM INTO A SHOP HE WALKED AS IF HE WERE IN GREAT PAIN JERRY OF COURSE CAME BACK TO THE STAND BUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES ONE OF THE SHOPMEN CALLED HIM
THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU AN EXTRA FARE I'LL DO MY VERY BEST SAID JERRY HEARTILY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH SIR FOR HE LOOKED DREADFULLY WHITE AND ILL I MUST GO HE SAID EARNESTLY
AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
AND IF JACK AND I CHOOSE TO HAVE A QUICK RUN NOW AND THEN TO PLEASE OURSELVES THAT'S OUR BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS WELL SAID LARRY YOU'LL NEVER BE A RICH MAN MOST LIKELY NOT SAID JERRY
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
LEAVING THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES SCARCELY SCARRED THE HEAT HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENT TO KILL THE TREE AND IN A FEW YEARS THE BARK SHRIVELS AND FALLS OFF FORESTS MILES IN EXTENT ARE THUS KILLED AND LEFT STANDING
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
AND MANAGE TO GET TO THE FRONT GOING SO NEAR THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE THAT HALF AN INCH NEARER AND THEY WOULD SCRAPE WELL YOU GET ALONG FOR A BIT BUT SOON FIND YOURSELF IN A LONG TRAIN OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES ALL OBLIGED TO GO AT A WALK
THE WESTERN JUNIPER THE JUNIPER OR RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS IS PREEMINENTLY A ROCK TREE
HE WAS VERY FOND OF MAKING LITTLE SONGS AND SINGING THEM TO HIMSELF ONE HE WAS VERY FOND OF WAS THIS COME FATHER AND MOTHER AND SISTER AND BROTHER COME ALL OF YOU TURN TO AND HELP ONE ANOTHER
YOU SHALL HAVE A SHILLING EXTRA I WILL TAKE YOU AT THE REGULAR PACE GENTLEMEN SHILLINGS DON'T PAY FOR PUTTING ON THE STEAM LIKE THAT LARRY'S CAB WAS STANDING NEXT TO OURS HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND SAID
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
FELICITY TRIED AND HAD THE MOST GRATIFYING LUCK WITH A NEW AND COMPLICATED CAKE RECIPE A GORGEOUS COMPOUND
THE NUMBER OF EGGS SHE USED IN IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED AUNT JANET'S THRIFTY SOUL BUT THAT CAKE LIKE BEAUTY WAS ITS OWN EXCUSE UNCLE ROGER ATE THREE SLICES OF IT AT TEA TIME AND TOLD FELICITY SHE WAS AN ARTIST
AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
THE STORY GIRL WOULD BOX HIS EARS WITH HER FIST AND SAY BLESS YOUR GRAY HEART PADDY YOU'RE A GOOD SORT OF OLD RASCAL AND PAT WOULD PURR HIS SATISFACTION I USED TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE SKIN ON HIS BACK SHAKE HIM GENTLY AND SAY
MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
KNOW HIM THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE BY THE BY AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER THOUGH I WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST
MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
NO IT ISN'T PEG BOWEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALKS I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A GHOST SAID THE STORY GIRL THE RULING PASSION STRONG EVEN IN EXTREMITY IT IS ABOUT A GHOST WITH EYEHOLES BUT NO EYES
I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
CECILY HOW OLD MUST WE BE BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A REAL BEAU BUT SARA ALWAYS DENIED IT SO I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FELIX SIMPLY MADE IT UP HIMSELF PADDY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY CATCHING A RAT
VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
THE MEMORY OF DOCTOR FRANKLIN IS JUSTLY HELD IN GREAT REVERENCE PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE WHERE A WAXEN EFFIGY OF HIM WAS RECENTLY ON EXHIBITION BEARING THE FOLLOWING TOUCHING ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE AND SERVICES TO SCIENCE
AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
I GOT DOWN THE BOOK AND READ ALL
BY ACIDITY OR ACERBITY AND SOMETIMES BY WISDOM FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE NOTABLE EPIGRAMS OF THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS DOCTOR JAMRACH HOLOBOM WE KNOW BETTER THE NEEDS OF OURSELVES THAN OF OTHERS
I FELT RATHER HURT ABOUT THIS AT FIRST
AND THEN IN AN UNTHINKING MOMENT I IDLY TURNED THE LEAVES AND BEGAN TO INDOLENTLY STUDY DISEASES GENERALLY I FORGET WHICH WAS THE FIRST DISTEMPER I PLUNGED INTO SOME FEARFUL DEVASTATING SCOURGE I KNOW
A PROSTRATING DISEASE CAUSED BY A DETERMINATION OF THE HEART TO THE HEAD IT IS SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY A COPIOUS DISCHARGE OF HYDRATED CHLORIDE OF SODIUM FROM THE EYES ENCOMIAST
BUT IS PLACABLE WITH AN OBOLUS A SEVERELY VIRTUOUS CENSOR BUT SO CHARITABLE WITHAL
DO YOUR POLICEMEN ALSO HAVE TO APPROVE THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT THEY ENFORCE TERRESTRIAN NOT YET
MUST HAVE HAD IT FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING IT
I READ THE PRESCRIPTION IT RAN
ORIGINAL MOTION CARRIED BY MAJORITY OF THREE TO ONE THERE WERE FOUR OF US GEORGE
WOMEN IN LOVE ARE LESS ASHAMED THAN MEN THEY HAVE LESS TO BE ASHAMED OF WHILE YOUR FRIEND HOLDS YOU AFFECTIONATELY BY BOTH YOUR HANDS YOU ARE SAFE FOR YOU CAN WATCH BOTH HIS EPITAPH
ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT
I USED THE MOST PATHETIC LANGUAGE I COULD THINK OF AND SAID THOU AND THEE THOU AND THEE SEEM SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN YOU
THAT WHICH DISCLOSES TO THE WISE AND DISGUISES FROM THE FOOLISH THEIR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EFFECT
A COMPOSITION IN VERSE IN WHICH WITHOUT EMPLOYING ANY OF THE METHODS OF HUMOR THE WRITER AIMS TO PRODUCE IN THE READER'S MIND THE DAMPEST KIND OF DEJECTION THE MOST FAMOUS ENGLISH EXAMPLE BEGINS SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS
CHOLERA I HAD WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS AND DIPHTHERIA I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORN WITH I PLODDED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TWENTY SIX LETTERS AND THE ONLY MALADY I COULD CONCLUDE I HAD NOT GOT
DUST SHAKEN OUT OF A BOOK INTO AN EMPTY SKULL SO WIDE HIS ERUDITION'S MIGHTY SPAN HE KNEW CREATION'S ORIGIN AND PLAN AND ONLY CAME BY ACCIDENT TO GRIEF HE THOUGHT POOR MAN TWAS RIGHT TO BE A THIEF
BUMBLESHOOK EDUCATION
AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH ME IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER I KNEW IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I HAD JUST BEEN READING A PATENT LIVER PILL CIRCULAR
MAY THEIR SOULS BE HAPPY IN HEAVEN EMANCIPATION
THE DOORKEEPER LOOKED WITH A COMICAL TWIST OF THE FACE AT THE EMINENT EGOTIST AND SAID GO AWAY FOR WE SETTLE HERE
THE ART OF ORALLY PERSUADING FOOLS
AND A SMALL PARCEL WERE PASSED ACROSS TO ANNE DEAR ANNE RAN THE FORMER MOTHER SAYS I'M NOT TO PLAY WITH YOU OR TALK TO YOU EVEN IN SCHOOL IT ISN'T MY FAULT AND DON'T BE CROSS AT ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS EVER
AND EVEN IF I HAD IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME SOMEHOW LITTLE DREAM GIRLS ARE NOT SATISFYING AFTER A REAL FRIEND DIANA AND I HAD SUCH AN AFFECTING FAREWELL DOWN BY THE SPRING IT WILL BE SACRED IN MY MEMORY FOREVER
THE POSITION FARTHEST REMOVED ON EITHER HAND FROM THE INTERLOCUTOR THE MAN WAS PERISHING APACE WHO PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE THE SEAL OF DEATH WAS ON HIS FACE TWAS PALLID FOR TWAS CLEAN THIS IS THE END
OF WHOM NOT A SINGLE FRAGMENT WAS EVER RECOVERED ELECTRICITY SEEMS DESTINED TO PLAY A MOST IMPORTANT PART IN THE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES THE QUESTION OF ITS ECONOMICAL APPLICATION TO SOME PURPOSES IS STILL UNSETTLED
MEGACEPH CHOSEN TO SERVE THE STATE IN THE HALLS OF LEGISLATIVE DEBATE ONE DAY WITH ALL HIS CREDENTIALS CAME TO THE CAPITOL'S DOOR AND ANNOUNCED HIS NAME
THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
SHE IS JUST DULL AND POKY AND NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT I FEEL SO DEPRESSED THAT PERHAPS IT WILL COME EASY TO ME NOW I'M GOING ROUND BY THE ROAD I COULDN'T BEAR TO GO BY THE BIRCH PATH ALL ALONE I SHOULD WEEP
THERE ARE THREE SEXES MALES FEMALES AND GIRLS BEAUTY IN WOMEN AND DISTINCTION IN MEN ARE ALIKE IN THIS
A BEARER OF GOOD TIDINGS PARTICULARLY IN A RELIGIOUS SENSE SUCH AS ASSURE US OF OUR OWN SALVATION AND THE DAMNATION OF OUR NEIGHBORS EVERLASTING A D J LASTING FOREVER
DESCRIBED IN THE CHARGE SHEET AS A MEDICAL STUDENT SO THAT HE NATURALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT FAMILY PHYSICIANARY WAY OF PUTTING THINGS I AGREED WITH GEORGE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SEEK OUT SOME RETIRED AND OLD WORLD SPOT
THE SICK MAN SAID IN FAINT AND FAILING TONES A MOMENT LATER HE WAS DEAD AND TAMBOURINE WAS BONES
AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND WENT OUT I DID NOT OPEN IT
OH DIANA WILL YOU PROMISE FAITHFULLY NEVER TO FORGET ME THE FRIEND OF YOUR YOUTH NO MATTER WHAT DEARER FRIENDS MAY CARESS THEE INDEED I WILL SOBBED DIANA AND I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BOSOM FRIEND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED
TERRESTRIAN IT DOES LUNARIAN WHY THEN SHOULD NOT YOUR LAWS PREVIOUSLY TO BEING EXECUTED BE VALIDATED NOT BY THE SIGNATURE OF YOUR PRESIDENT BUT BY THAT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO ENFORCE THE WISHES OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT SHALL BE PLEASED TO PRONOUNCE THEM INVALID AND OF NO EFFECT
THE NEXT MORNING ANNE HAVING WRESTLED WILDLY WITH DECIMALS THE ENTIRE EVENING BEFORE WOULD BE FIRST ONE AWFUL DAY THEY WERE TIES AND THEIR NAMES WERE WRITTEN UP TOGETHER IT WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS A TAKE NOTICE
WHY I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE I CANNOT TELL YOU BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT I HAVE NOT GOT IT EVERYTHING ELSE HOWEVER I HAVE GOT AND I TOLD HIM HOW I CAME TO DISCOVER IT ALL
TERRESTRIAN THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR ANY SUCH COURSE LUNARIAN PRECEDENT WHAT IS THAT TERRESTRIAN
AND AT INTERVALS FROM BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE IS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOREMAN DEMANDING THREE INCHES OF WIT
FROM THE OFFICER OF LOWER RANK TO WHOM HIS DEATH WOULD GIVE PROMOTION EPICURE
TO SERVE ONESELF IS ECONOMY OF ADMINISTRATION IN EACH HUMAN HEART ARE A TIGER A PIG AN ASS AND A NIGHTINGALE DIVERSITY OF CHARACTER IS DUE TO THEIR UNEQUAL ACTIVITY
THE EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE IS AN EXPRESSION CONSTANTLY UPON THE LIPS OF THE IGNORANT WHO PARROT IT FROM ONE ANOTHER WITH NEVER A THOUGHT OF ITS ABSURDITY IN THE LATIN EXCEPTIO PROBAT REGULAM
UNTIL HAVING PERHAPS BEEN ENFORCED FOR MANY YEARS SOMEBODY OBJECTS TO ITS OPERATION AGAINST HIMSELF I MEAN HIS CLIENT THE PRESIDENT IF HE APPROVES IT BEGINS TO EXECUTE IT AT ONCE
HE SAID HE DIDN'T KEEP IT I SAID YOU ARE A CHEMIST
THE VIOLET AND ROSE ARE LANGUISHING FOR A NIBBLE AT HIS GLUTOEUS MAXIMUS EMOTION
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
ALTHOUGH MUCH IMPROOVED YOURS UNTIL DEATH US DO PART ANNE OR CORDELIA SHIRLEY P S I SHALL SLEEP WITH YOUR LETTER UNDER MY PILLOW TONIGHT A OR C S
THERE WERE NO MORE DISEASES AFTER ZYMOSIS SO I CONCLUDED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THE MATTER WITH ME I SAT AND PONDERED
NO SIR BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO ANCHOR ON IT
A THING WHICH TAKES THE LIBERTY TO DIFFER FROM OTHER THINGS OF ITS CLASS
BITTER TEARS IF I DID ANNE WAS WELCOMED BACK TO SCHOOL WITH OPEN ARMS HER IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SORELY MISSED IN GAMES HER VOICE IN THE SINGING AND HER DRAMATIC ABILITY IN THE PERUSAL ALOUD OF BOOKS AT DINNER HOUR
WE SMILED SADLY AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID WE SUPPOSED WE HAD BETTER TRY TO SWALLOW A BIT HARRIS SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING IN ONE'S STOMACH OFTEN KEPT THE DISEASE IN CHECK AND MISSUS POPPETS BROUGHT THE TRAY IN
FOR THE PRICE OF THE COW THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD EDIBLE A D J GOOD TO EAT AND WHOLESOME TO DIGEST
AND HER LIPS PRIMMED UP INTO A LINE OF DETERMINATION I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IS ALL THERE IS LEFT IN LIFE FOR ME NOW THAT MY FRIEND HAS BEEN RUTHLESSLY TORN FROM ME IN SCHOOL I CAN LOOK AT HER AND MUSE OVER DAYS DEPARTED
WHY THIS INVIDIOUS RESERVATION AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER LESS GRASPING FEELINGS PREVAILED I REFLECTED THAT I HAD EVERY OTHER KNOWN MALADY IN THE PHARMACOLOGY AND I GREW LESS SELFISH
AND WILLIAM HARRIS TOLD US HOW HE FELT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AND GEORGE STOOD ON THE HEARTH RUG AND GAVE US A CLEVER AND POWERFUL PIECE OF ACTING ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW HE FELT IN THE NIGHT GEORGE FANCIES HE IS ILL
A TRANSIENT HORRIBLE FANTASTIC DREAM WHEREIN IS NOTHING YET ALL THINGS DO SEEM FROM WHICH WE'RE WAKENED BY A FRIENDLY NUDGE OF OUR BEDFELLOW DEATH AND CRY O FUDGE
BUT THIS SYSTEM OF MAINTAINING AN EXPENSIVE JUDICIAL MACHINERY TO PASS UPON THE VALIDITY OF LAWS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE LONG BEEN EXECUTED
AND ESOTERIC THOSE THAT NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND IT IS THE LATTER THAT HAVE MOST PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED MODERN THOUGHT AND FOUND GREATEST ACCEPTANCE IN OUR TIME ETHNOLOGY
AND ROAST IT TO A NUT BROWN DISCOMFORT EXILE
I'LL TRY TO BE A MODEL PUPIL AGREED ANNE DOLEFULLY THERE WON'T BE MUCH FUN IN IT I EXPECT MISTER PHILLIPS SAID MINNIE ANDREWS WAS A MODEL PUPIL AND THERE ISN'T A SPARK OF IMAGINATION OR LIFE IN HER
AND JULIA BELL COPIED CAREFULLY ON A PIECE OF PALE PINK PAPER SCALLOPED ON THE EDGES THE FOLLOWING EFFUSION WHEN TWILIGHT DROPS HER CURTAIN DOWN AND PINS IT WITH A STAR REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND THOUGH SHE MAY WANDER FAR
SO NICE FOR TRIMMING APRONS KATIE BOULTER
AND REWARDED THE DONOR WITH A SMILE WHICH EXALTED THAT INFATUATED YOUTH STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT AND CAUSED HIM TO MAKE SUCH FEARFUL ERRORS IN HIS DICTATION THAT MISTER PHILLIPS KEPT HIM IN AFTER SCHOOL TO REWRITE IT
IT'S SO NICE TO BE APPRECIATED SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT THE GIRLS WERE NOT THE ONLY SCHOLARS WHO APPRECIATED HER WHEN ANNE WENT TO HER SEAT AFTER DINNER HOUR
TO DECLARE THE RABBIT THE CAUSE OF A DOG EGOTIST
BUT THE UNANIMOUS OPINION WAS THAT IT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN BROUGHT ON BY OVERWORK WHAT WE WANT IS REST SAID HARRIS REST AND A COMPLETE CHANGE SAID GEORGE
BY EMBALMING THEIR DEAD AND THEREBY DERANGING THE NATURAL BALANCE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE THE EGYPTIANS MADE THEIR ONCE FERTILE AND POPULOUS COUNTRY BARREN AND INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING MORE THAN A MEAGRE CREW THE MODERN METALLIC
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO WALK THE HOSPITALS IF THEY HAD ME I WAS A HOSPITAL IN MYSELF
FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT I HAD THAT TOO BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN MY CASE AND DETERMINED TO SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND SO STARTED ALPHABETICALLY
MISTER PHILLIPS MIGHT NOT BE A VERY GOOD TEACHER BUT A PUPIL SO INFLEXIBLY DETERMINED ON LEARNING AS ANNE WAS COULD HARDLY ESCAPE MAKING PROGRESS UNDER ANY KIND OF TEACHER
HIGH PINNACLED UPON THE THRONE OF THOUGHT HIS FACE SUFFUSED WITH THE DIM SPLENDORS OF THE TRANSFIGURATION HIS LEGS INTERTWISTED AND HIS TONGUE A CHEEK THE EDITOR SPILLS HIS WILL ALONG THE PAPER AND CUTS IT OFF IN LENGTHS TO SUIT
A MAN WHO TO ALL THINGS UNDER THE SKY ASSENTS BY ETERNALLY VOTING I EJECTION
AND FORBIDDING CHRIST TO SAVE HIM
AS ROBBERS THIEVES SWINDLERS DUNCES LUNATICS IDIOTS AND ETHNOLOGISTS EUCHARIST
SHE WOULD NOT STOOP TO ADMIT THAT SHE MEANT TO RIVAL GILBERT IN SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS EXISTENCE WHICH ANNE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED BUT THE RIVALRY WAS THERE AND HONORS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN THEM
IT'S A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH WILL FOREVER SHINE ON THE DARKNESS OF A PATH SEVERED FROM THEE DIANA OH JUST SAY IT ONCE AGAIN I LOVE YOU DEVOTEDLY ANNE SAID DIANA STANCHLY AND I ALWAYS WILL YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT
EVEN DIANA GETS ALONG BETTER THAN I DO BUT I DON'T MIND BEING BEATEN BY DIANA
A SHORT SHARP SAYING IN PROSE OR VERSE
THE OVERSTRAIN UPON OUR BRAINS HAS PRODUCED A GENERAL DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGE OF SCENE AND ABSENCE OF THE NECESSITY FOR THOUGHT WILL RESTORE THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
WE WERE SITTING IN MY ROOM SMOKING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD WE WERE BAD FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE ALL FEELING SEEDY AND WE WERE GETTING QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT HARRIS SAID HE FELT SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FITS OF
AT LEAST SHE GOT ON VERY WELL WITH MISTER PHILLIPS THENCEFORTH SHE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER STUDIES HEART AND SOUL DETERMINED NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN ANY CLASS BY GILBERT BLYTHE THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM WAS SOON APPARENT
AN IMAGINARY DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY WHICH THE ANCIENTS FOOLISHLY BELIEVED TO BE INHABITED BY THE SPIRITS OF THE GOOD THIS RIDICULOUS AND MISCHIEVOUS FABLE WAS SWEPT OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH BY THE EARLY CHRISTIANS
PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS IT WAS BORNE IN UPON ME THAT I HAD FAIRLY GOT IT I SAT FOR AWHILE FROZEN WITH HORROR AND THEN IN THE LISTLESSNESS OF DESPAIR I AGAIN TURNED OVER THE PAGES
I FELT MY PULSE I COULD NOT AT FIRST FEEL ANY PULSE AT ALL
A BONDMAN'S CHANGE FROM THE TYRANNY OF ANOTHER TO THE DESPOTISM OF HIMSELF HE WAS A SLAVE AT WORD HE WENT AND CAME HIS IRON COLLAR CUT HIM TO THE BONE THEN LIBERTY ERASED HIS OWNER'S NAME
PETULANTLY UTTERING HIS MIND AT THE TAIL OF A DOG THEN STRAIGHTWAY MURMURS A MILD MELODIOUS LAY SOFT AS THE COOING OF A DONKEY INTONING ITS PRAYER TO THE EVENING STAR MASTER OF MYSTERIES AND LORD OF LAW
THEY GAVE ME CLUMPS ON THE SIDE OF THE
I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR OF YOUR DYING OF GRIEF AS LONG AS YOU CAN TALK ANNE SAID MARILLA UNSYMPATHETICALLY THE FOLLOWING MONDAY ANNE SURPRISED MARILLA BY COMING DOWN FROM HER ROOM WITH HER BASKET OF BOOKS ON HER ARM AND HIP
THAT IT WILL PROPEL A STREET CAR BETTER THAN A GAS JET
IF I WAS A CO OPERATIVE STORES AND FAMILY HOTEL COMBINED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBLIGE YOU
THE WISDOM THAT ENABLES US TO RECOGNIZE AS AN UNDESIRABLE OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE FOLLY THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EMBRACED
THAN A WHOLE BOX OF PILLS DOES NOW
WHAT I SUFFER IN THAT WAY NO TONGUE CAN TELL FROM MY EARLIEST INFANCY I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT AS A BOY THE DISEASE HARDLY EVER LEFT ME FOR A DAY
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW
A WEEK ON THE ROLLING DEEP
BURIAL CASKET IS A STEP IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND MANY A DEAD MAN WHO OUGHT NOW TO BE ORNAMENTING HIS NEIGHBOR'S LAWN AS A TREE OR ENRICHING HIS TABLE AS A BUNCH OF RADISHES IS DOOMED TO A LONG INUTILITY
AND THAT THE ACUTE STAGE WOULD COMMENCE IN ABOUT ANOTHER FORTNIGHT BRIGHT'S DISEASE I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND I HAD ONLY IN A MODIFIED FORM AND SO FAR AS THAT WAS CONCERNED I MIGHT LIVE FOR YEARS
MEANS THAT THE EXCEPTION TESTS THE RULE PUTS IT TO THE PROOF NOT CONFIRMS IT THE MALEFACTOR WHO DREW THE MEANING FROM THIS EXCELLENT DICTUM AND SUBSTITUTED A CONTRARY ONE OF HIS OWN
AND WE DREW UP TO THE TABLE AND TOYED WITH A LITTLE STEAK AND ONIONS AND SOME RHUBARB TART I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER THE FIRST HALF HOUR OR SO I SEEMED TO TAKE NO INTEREST WHATEVER IN MY FOOD AN UNUSUAL THING FOR ME
IT IS WITH NO SMALL DIFFIDENCE THAT I VENTURE TO OFFER THIS BRIEF AND ELEMENTARY DEFINITION FOR I AM NOT UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A BULKY VOLUME BY A SOMETIME BISHOP OF WORCESTER ENTITLED
MARILLA PESSIMISTICALLY EXPECTED MORE TROUBLE SINCE ANNE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT NONE DEVELOPED PERHAPS ANNE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE MODEL SPIRIT FROM MINNIE ANDREWS
THEY ARE AWFULLY FASHIONABLE NOW AND ONLY THREE GIRLS IN SCHOOL KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT REMEMBER YOUR TRUE FRIEND DIANA BARRY ANNE READ THE NOTE
ESOTERIC A D J VERY PARTICULARLY ABSTRUSE AND CONSUMMATELY OCCULT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHIES WERE OF TWO KINDS EXOTERIC THOSE THAT THE PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES COULD PARTLY UNDERSTAND
ANNE'S LITTLE TRIUMPH DIANA MIGHT JUST HAVE SMILED AT ME ONCE I THINK SHE MOURNED TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE MOST FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TWISTED AND FOLDED
AND ANNE'S MORTIFICATION WAS AS EVIDENT AS GILBERT'S SATISFACTION WHEN THE WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH WERE HELD THE SUSPENSE WAS TERRIBLE THE FIRST MONTH GILBERT CAME OUT THREE MARKS AHEAD THE SECOND
ASTONISHMENT AND HOPE STRUGGLING IN HER EXPRESSIVE EYES BUT THE HOPE FADED WHEN SHE SAW DIANA'S DEJECTED COUNTENANCE YOUR MOTHER HASN'T RELENTED SHE GASPED DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY NO AND OH ANNE
HUCKLE EXECUTIVE
AN INSCRIPTION ON A TOMB SHOWING THAT VIRTUES ACQUIRED BY DEATH HAVE A RETROACTIVE EFFECT FOLLOWING IS A TOUCHING EXAMPLE
WISE PIOUS HUMBLE AND ALL THAT WHO SHOWED US LIFE AS ALL SHOULD LIVE IT LET THAT BE SAID AND GOD FORGIVE IT
ONE OF THE MANY METHODS BY WHICH FOOLS PREFER TO LOSE THEIR FRIENDS
ONE WHO SERVES HIS COUNTRY BY RESIDING ABROAD YET IS NOT AN AMBASSADOR
AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THEE DIANA SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN THE YEARS TO COME THY MEMORY WILL SHINE LIKE A STAR OVER MY LONELY LIFE
PRAISE OF A PERSON WHO HAS EITHER THE ADVANTAGES OF WEALTH AND POWER OR THE CONSIDERATION TO BE DEAD EVANGELIST
FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD AND DREAM AWAY A SUNNY WEEK AMONG ITS DROWSY LANES SOME HALF FORGOTTEN NOOK HIDDEN AWAY BY THE FAIRIES OUT OF REACH OF THE NOISY WORLD
PLEASE SEE THAT IT IS BURIED WITH ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL LIVE VERY LONG PERHAPS WHEN SHE SEES ME LYING COLD AND DEAD BEFORE HER MISSUS BARRY MAY FEEL REMORSE FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE AND WILL LET DIANA COME TO MY FUNERAL
I SHALL KEEP YOUR LOVELY PRESENT FOREVER MINNIE ANDREWS IS A VERY NICE LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IMAGINATION BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN DIANA'S BUSUM FRIEND I CANNOT BE MINNIE'S
BEDIZENED WITH STRIPED RED AND YELLOW PAPER COSTING TWO CENTS WHERE ORDINARY PENCILS COST ONLY ONE WHICH HE SENT UP TO HER AFTER DINNER HOUR MET WITH A MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION ANNE WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT IT
AN APPROVED REMEDY FOR THE DISEASE OF GARRULITY IT IS ALSO MUCH USED IN CASES OF EXTREME POVERTY ELECTOR
SILLY OLD QUILLY OLD MONARCH OF THOUGHT PUBLIC OPINION'S CAMP FOLLOWER HE THUNDERING BLUNDERING PLUNDERING FREE AFFECTED UNGRACIOUS SUSPECTED MENDACIOUS RESPECTED CONTEMPORAREE
LUNARIAN I SEE THE DEATH WARRANT IS NOT VALID UNTIL SIGNED BY THE MURDERER TERRESTRIAN MY FRIEND YOU PUT IT TOO STRONGLY WE ARE NOT SO CONSISTENT LUNARIAN
I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME DEAR BOY WITH TELLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME LIFE IS BRIEF AND YOU MIGHT PASS AWAY BEFORE I HAD FINISHED BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT THE MATTER WITH ME I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE
OR BIDDING HIM TURN OFF THE WISDOM AND WHACK UP SOME PATHOS
IT WAS ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED ON GILBERT'S SIDE BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE FEARED THAT THE SAME THING CANNOT BE SAID OF ANNE WHO HAD CERTAINLY AN UNPRAISEWORTHY TENACITY FOR HOLDING GRUDGES SHE WAS AS INTENSE IN HER HATREDS AS IN HER LOVES
THIS ILLUSTRIOUS SAVANT AFTER HAVING MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES AROUND THE WORLD
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
IT INCLUDES THE GIFT OF MAKING ANY COLOR APPEAR WHITE ELYSIUM
WE SHALL GET HIM AFTER AWHILE IF WE ARE SPARED
KISSED THE BOOKMARK AND DISPATCHED A PROMPT REPLY BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL MY OWN DARLING DIANA OF COURSE I AM NOT CROSS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OBEY YOUR MOTHER OUR SPIRITS CAN COMMUNE
IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL STUFF MARILLA SHE GROANED I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN IT AT ALL MISTER PHILLIPS SAYS I'M THE WORST DUNCE HE EVER SAW AT IT
A SNAKE TO A PIG A PIG TO A MAN AND A MAN TO A WORM EDITOR
THE CUR FORETELLS THE KNELL OF PARTING DAY THE LOAFING HERD WINDS SLOWLY O'ER THE LEA THE WISE MAN HOMEWARD PLODS I ONLY STAY TO FIDDLE FADDLE IN A MINOR KEY ELOQUENCE
I CAME TO TYPHOID FEVER READ THE SYMPTOMS
THE LAW OF MODERATION HAIL HIGH EXCESS ESPECIALLY IN WINE TO THEE IN WORSHIP DO I BEND THE KNEE
SO HOW CAN ANY ONE KNOW EXHORT
A SPECIAL BUT NOT PARTICULAR KIND OF LIAR END
ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
YET THE EFFECT OF THOSE TROUBLES WAS THAT SCHEMES OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS REFORM WERE GENERALLY REGARDED WITH SUSPICION AND CONTEMPT DURING TWENTY YEARS THE CHIEF EMPLOYMENT OF BUSY AND INGENIOUS MEN HAD BEEN TO FRAME CONSTITUTIONS WITH FIRST MAGISTRATES
WHILE HE ON THE ROCK OF SAINT HELENA MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
I TAKE ALL HIS FLOWERS AND TREES AND PLANT THEM OUT IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF PARADISE IN THE UNKNOWN LAND BUT HOW THEY GROW THERE AND HOW IT IS THERE I DARE NOT TELL THEE GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD SAID THE MOTHER
WITH SENATES APPOINTED BY LOT WITH ANNUAL SENATES WITH PERPETUAL SENATES IN THESE PLANS NOTHING WAS OMITTED ALL THE DETAIL ALL THE NOMENCLATURE ALL THE CEREMONIAL OF THE IMAGINARY GOVERNMENT WAS FULLY SET FORTH POLEMARCHS AND PHYLARCHS
IT SEEMED THAT THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THAT THE MEN OF THE SWORD WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE MEN OF THE GOWN A COALITION
IT WAS SO PALE THE SMALL EYES HAD CLOSED THEMSELVES AND IT DREW ITS BREATH SO SOFTLY NOW AND THEN WITH A DEEP RESPIRATION AS IF IT SIGHED AND THE MOTHER LOOKED STILL MORE SORROWFULLY ON THE LITTLE CREATURE
THE ROADS CROSSED EACH OTHER IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST AND SHE NO LONGER KNEW WHITHER SHE SHOULD GO
AND THE HIGH COMMISSION THE FORMER A POLITICAL THE LATTER A RELIGIOUS INQUISITION NEITHER WAS A PART OF THE OLD CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND THE STAR CHAMBER HAD BEEN REMODELLED AND THE HIGH COMMISSION CREATED BY THE TUDORS
AND GOT THE OLD WOMAN'S SNOW WHITE HAIR INSTEAD SO THEY WENT INTO DEATH'S GREAT GREENHOUSE WHERE FLOWERS AND TREES GREW STRANGELY INTO ONE ANOTHER THERE STOOD FINE HYACINTHS UNDER GLASS BELLS AND THERE STOOD
LAUD HAD DEPARTED FARTHEST FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORMATION AND HAD DRAWN NEAREST TO ROME HIS THEOLOGY WAS MORE REMOTE THAN EVEN THAT OF THE DUTCH ARMINIANS FROM THE THEOLOGY OF THE CALVINISTS
DURING A WHOLE GENERATION HIS PHILOSOPHY HAD AMIDST TUMULTS WARS AND PROSCRIPTIONS BEEN SLOWLY RIPENING IN A FEW WELL CONSTITUTED MINDS
HIS RAPID ELEVATION HIS PROSPERITY AND GLORY HIS INAUGURATION IN THE HALL AND HIS
AND FELT TOWARDS THOSE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED THAT PECULIAR MALIGNITY WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF APOSTATES
SHE HAD NOT CLOSED HER EYES FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS AND NOW SHE SLEPT BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE WHEN SHE STARTED UP AND TREMBLED WITH COLD WHAT IS THAT SAID SHE AND LOOKED ON
APPROVED BY THE MILITARY SAINTS
HE HAD RECEIVED FROM NATURE A FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING A FAR STRONGER WILL
AND THOUGH NO PAPIST LIKED A PAPIST MUCH BETTER THAN A PURITAN IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO DENY THAT CHARLES HAD SOME OF THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD AND EVEN OF A GREAT PRINCE HE WROTE AND SPOKE NOT LIKE HIS FATHER
HIS HUMANITY INGENUOUSNESS AND MODESTY THE MEDIOCRITY OF HIS ABILITIES AND THE DOCILITY WITH WHICH HE SUBMITTED TO THE GUIDANCE OF PERSONS WISER THAN HIMSELF ADMIRABLY QUALIFIED HIM TO BE THE HEAD OF A LIMITED MONARCHY
AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN TO DEPRIVE THE COURTS OF LAW OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY
EVERY TREE AND EVERY FLOWER HAD ITS NAME EACH OF THEM WAS A HUMAN LIFE THE HUMAN FRAME STILL LIVED ONE IN CHINA AND ANOTHER IN GREENLAND ROUND ABOUT IN THE WORLD
TO THIS SCHEME IN HIS CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE HE GAVE THE EXPRESSIVE NAME OF THOROUGH HIS OBJECT WAS TO DO IN ENGLAND ALL AND MORE THAN ALL
ONE CHOICE ONLY WAS LEFT THE STUARTS OR THE ARMY THE BANISHED FAMILY HAD COMMITTED GREAT FAULTS BUT IT HAD DEARLY EXPIATED THOSE FAULTS AND HAD UNDERGONE A LONG AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED A SALUTARY TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY
BUT DESTITUTE OF THE WISDOM AND CIVIL COURAGE WHICH HAD BEEN CONSPICUOUS IN THEIR DECEASED LEADER SOME OF THEM WERE HONEST BUT FANATICAL INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS OF THIS CLASS FLEETWOOD WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE
IT SEEMED BUT TOO LIKELY THAT ENGLAND WOULD FALL UNDER THE MOST ODIOUS
THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT CEASING TO OPERATE IN POLITICS BEGAN TO EXERT ITSELF WITH UNPRECEDENTED VIGOUR AND HARDIHOOD IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS
HE HAD NOT EXPECTED AN EARLY CROP
WITH ALMOST BOUNDLESS POWER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES ALL THESE TRIBUNALS INSULTED AND DEFIED THE AUTHORITY OF WESTMINSTER HALL AND DAILY COMMITTED EXCESSES WHICH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ROYALISTS HAVE WARMLY CONDEMNED
BUT DO NOT STOP ME NOW I MAY OVERTAKE HIM I MAY FIND MY CHILD BUT NIGHT STOOD STILL AND MUTE THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS
AND STRETCHED HER HANDS OUT OVER A LITTLE BLUE CROCUS THAT HUNG QUITE SICKLY ON ONE SIDE
TRIBES AND GALAXIES THE LORD ARCHON AND THE LORD STRATEGUS WHICH BALLOT BOXES WERE TO BE GREEN AND WHICH RED WHICH BALLS WERE TO BE OF GOLD AND WHICH OF SILVER WHICH MAGISTRATES WERE TO WEAR HATS AND WHICH BLACK VELVET CAPS WITH PEAKS
THE PROMISE BY WHICH THAT SUPPLY HAD BEEN OBTAINED WAS BROKEN
THEY ACCORDINGLY DOLED OUT SUPPLIES TO HIM VERY SPARINGLY
QUICK TO FEEL FOR HIS OWN DIGNITY SLOW TO SYMPATHISE WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS AND PRONE TO THE ERROR
IT WAS THEN THAT RAY MADE A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS AND FISHES AND THAT THE ATTENTION OF WOODWARD WAS FIRST DRAWN TOWARDS FOSSILS AND SHELLS
AND IN CAME A POOR OLD MAN WRAPPED UP AS IN A LARGE HORSE CLOTH FOR IT WARMS ONE AND HE NEEDED IT AS IT WAS THE COLD WINTER SEASON
THE GREAT PLAGUE OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE INDUCED THEM TO CONSIDER WITH CARE THE DEFECTIVE ARCHITECTURE
AND ABUSES WHICH WERE IN STRICT CONFORMITY WITH THE LAW AND WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SWORD GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION
EVEN THE DEVOTIONS OF PRIVATE FAMILIES COULD NOT ESCAPE THE VIGILANCE OF HIS SPIES
I KNOW IT SAID THE WOMAN IN THE BLACK CLOTHES
AND WAS MUCH MORE DISPOSED THAN HIS FATHER TO CARRY THEM INTO PRACTICE HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER A ZEALOUS EPISCOPALIAN HE WAS MOREOVER WHAT HIS FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN A ZEALOUS ARMINIAN
EITHER TO MONARCHY OR TO LIBERTY THAT MIGHTY FORCE WHICH HAD DURING MANY YEARS ACTED AS ONE MAN AND WHICH WHILE SO ACTING HAD BEEN FOUND IRRESISTIBLE WAS AT LENGTH DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF
WHICH IS THE BEST HEAR ME NOT HEAR ME NOT
AND SHE WEPT AND PRAYED AT ONCE SHE SEIZED HOLD OF TWO BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS CLOSE BY WITH EACH HAND AND CRIED OUT TO DEATH
FOR A TIME IT SEEMED HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ABLE ADVISERS EFFECT WHAT HIS FATHER HAD ATTEMPTED IN VAIN A PARLIAMENT WAS CALLED AND THE WRITS WERE DIRECTED AFTER THE OLD FASHION
WE ARE INFORMED BY CLARENDON THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A MAN OF NOTE IN THE REALM
DIVEST HIMSELF OF HIS DESPOTIC AUTHORITY AND THAT IN EVERY PROMISE WHICH HE MADE THERE WAS AN IMPLIED RESERVATION THAT SUCH PROMISE MIGHT BE BROKEN IN CASE OF NECESSITY AND THAT OF THE NECESSITY HE WAS THE SOLE JUDGE
DEATH WILL SOON COME AND PLANT THEM OVER AGAIN
EVEN IN THE MOST DECENT AND REGULAR MANNER
HE FELL INGLORIOUSLY AND WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HE WAS USED BY THE ARMY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSOLVING THE PARLIAMENT AND WAS THEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY THROWN ASIDE
WHERE SHALL I FIND MY LITTLE CHILD NAY I KNOW NOT SAID THE WOMAN
WHICH HE HAD INHERITED HE HAD NEVER LED THEM TO VICTORY HE HAD NEVER EVEN BORNE ARMS
AND GREEDINESS OF THE STAR CHAMBER
TO THIS CHANGE BUT THOUGH SPECULATIVE MEN MIGHT EVEN IN THAT AGE DISCERN THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM AND PREDICT THAT THOSE VICES WOULD SOONER OR LATER PRODUCE SERIOUS PRACTICAL EVIL
WITH THE EXACTNESS OF A PROFESSOR BUT AFTER THE FASHION OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL EDUCATED GENTLEMEN HIS TASTE IN LITERATURE AND ART WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER DIGNIFIED THOUGH NOT GRACIOUS HIS DOMESTIC LIFE WITHOUT BLEMISH
ONLY ONCE HAD THERE BEEN AN INTERVAL OF EVEN HALF THAT LENGTH THIS FACT ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO REFUTE THOSE WHO REPRESENT CHARLES AS HAVING MERELY TRODDEN IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PLANTAGENETS AND TUDORS
THE JUDGES OF THE COMMON LAW HOLDING THEIR SITUATIONS DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE KING WERE SCANDALOUSLY OBSEQUIOUS
I AM FREEZING TO DEATH I SHALL BECOME A LUMP OF ICE
WHILE FACTIONS WERE STRUGGLING FOR DOMINION OVER EACH OTHER A SMALL BODY OF SAGES HAD TURNED AWAY WITH BENEVOLENT DISDAIN FROM THE CONFLICT AND HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE NOBLER WORK OF EXTENDING THE DOMINION OF MAN OVER MATTER
FOR THESE THINGS HISTORY MUST HOLD THE KING HIMSELF CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FROM THE TIME OF HIS THIRD PARLIAMENT HE WAS HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER
AND HER BLOOD FLOWED IN LARGE DROPS
AND BY INVITING THAT ASSEMBLY TO RESUME ITS FUNCTIONS THE OLD SPEAKER AND A QUORUM OF THE OLD MEMBERS CAME TOGETHER AND WERE PROCLAIMED AMIDST THE SCARCELY STIFLED DERISION AND EXECRATION OF THE WHOLE NATION THE SUPREME POWER IN THE COMMONWEALTH
SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS WERE IMPRISONED AND ONE OF THEM SIR JOHN ELIOT AFTER YEARS OF SUFFERING DIED IN CONFINEMENT CHARLES HOWEVER COULD NOT VENTURE TO RAISE BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY
THAT PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS TO SEE THE OLD CIVIL POLITY
BUT YET MANY MORE TEARS AND THEN NIGHT SAID GO TO THE RIGHT INTO THE DARK PINE FOREST THITHER I SAW DEATH TAKE HIS WAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD
BUT HAD MANY REASONS FOR DREADING THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD FAMILY RICHARD WAS THE VERY MAN FOR POLITICIANS OF THIS DESCRIPTION
HOW HAST THOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND THY WAY HITHER
IN THAT YEAR THE ROYAL SOCIETY DESTINED TO BE A CHIEF AGENT IN A LONG SERIES OF GLORIOUS AND SALUTARY REFORMS
HAST SUNG FOR THY CHILD I AM FOND OF THEM I HAVE HEARD THEM BEFORE I AM NIGHT I SAW THY TEARS WHILST THOU SANG'ST THEM
EITHER SHARE THE FATE OF THE SENATES OF THE CONTINENT OR OBTAIN SUPREME ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE JUST AT THIS CONJUNCTURE JAMES DIED CHARLES THE FIRST SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO A GENERATION WHICH HAS BEEN EXCITED ALMOST TO MADNESS BY THE QUESTION OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
HASTENED THE CRISIS ALARM AND RESENTMENT SPREAD THROUGH THE CAMP
WAS A COURSE WHICH HENRY THE EIGHTH HIMSELF WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO TAKE IT SEEMED THEREFORE THAT THE DECISIVE HOUR WAS APPROACHING
AND HEARD WITHIN THEM HOW THE HUMAN HEART BEAT
AS OFTEN AS THE TRUNCHEON WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FEEBLE HAND TO ANOTHER
HIS ILL CONCEALED DISLIKE OF THE MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS THE ARDENT AND NOT ALTOGETHER DISINTERESTED ZEAL WITH WHICH HE ASSERTED THE CLAIMS OF THE CLERGY TO THE REVERENCE OF THE LAITY WOULD HAVE MADE HIM AN OBJECT OF AVERSION TO THE PURITANS
HE NOW DETERMINED ON A CHANGE OF TACTICS INSTEAD OF OPPOSING AN INFLEXIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE DEMANDS OF THE COMMONS HE AFTER MUCH ALTERCATION AND MANY EVASIONS AGREED TO A COMPROMISE WHICH IF HE HAD FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO IT
COULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION THAT INSTRUMENT WAS A STANDING ARMY TO THE FORMING OF SUCH AN ARMY THEREFORE HE DIRECTED ALL THE ENERGY OF HIS STRONG MIND
AND THEY PURSUED THE OBJECTS OF THEIR WILD AMBITION NOT LIKE HIM
THE CLERK HAD PRONOUNCED THE ANCIENT FORM OF WORDS BY WHICH OUR PRINCES HAVE DURING MANY AGES
AND SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WELL
TOUCH THEM NOT SAID DEATH
GUIDED CHIEFLY BY THE VIOLENT SPIRIT OF THE PRIMATE AND FREE FROM THE CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT THEY DISPLAYED A RAPACITY A VIOLENCE A MALIGNANT ENERGY WHICH HAD BEEN UNKNOWN TO ANY FORMER AGE
THERE WERE LARGE TREES IN SMALL POTS SO THAT THEY STOOD SO STUNTED IN GROWTH
AND SHE FLEW IN THE ROCKING WAVES TO THE SHORE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
A COHERENCE A PRECISION WHICH IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PURSUING AN OBJECT
KNOW FROM ME THAT THE ONE FLOWER WAS THY OWN CHILD IT WAS THY CHILD'S FATE THOU SAW'ST THY OWN CHILD'S FUTURE LIFE THEN THE MOTHER SCREAMED WITH TERROR
A SEPARATE COUNCIL WHICH SATE AT YORK UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF WENTWORTH WAS ARMED IN DEFIANCE OF LAW
WOULD HAVE AVERTED A LONG SERIES OF CALAMITIES THE PARLIAMENT GRANTED AN AMPLE SUPPLY THE KING RATIFIED IN THE MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT CELEBRATED LAW WHICH IS
THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THE OFFICERS WHO HAD THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCE AMONG THE TROOPS STATIONED NEAR LONDON WERE NOT HIS FRIENDS
COULD WADE THROUGH IT AND ACROSS IT SHE MUST GO IF SHE WOULD FIND HER CHILD THEN SHE LAY DOWN TO DRINK UP THE LAKE AND THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR A HUMAN BEING BUT THE AFFLICTED MOTHER THOUGHT THAT A MIRACLE MIGHT HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS
FOR THE DREAD OF THAT INVINCIBLE ARMY WAS ON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND AND THE CAVALIERS TAUGHT BY A HUNDRED DISASTROUS FIELDS HOW LITTLE NUMBERS CAN EFFECT AGAINST DISCIPLINE
AND TO PUNISH WITH MERCILESS RIGOUR ALL WHO MURMURED AT THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND ICE FLAKES HUNG ON THE BRANCHES HAST THOU NOT SEEN DEATH GO PAST WITH MY LITTLE CHILD
TO BE OF FEARFUL AUGURY EXCITED GENERAL DISCONTENT AND ALARM COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS WERE BILLETED ON THE PEOPLE AND MARTIAL LAW WAS IN SOME PLACES
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRST MAGISTRATE AND NO HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS COULD NOT LAST ON THE
SUCH WAS THE END WHICH CHARLES DISTINCTLY PROPOSED TO HIMSELF FROM MARCH SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE TO APRIL SIXTEEN FORTY THE HOUSES WERE NOT CONVOKED
BUT ALSO OVER THE ENGLISH COLONISTS AND WAS ABLE TO BOAST THAT IN THAT ISLAND
TO FINE IMPRISON
ON THE TROOPS IF THE PRESBYTERIANS OBSTINATELY STOOD ALOOF FROM THE ROYALISTS THE STATE WAS LOST AND MEN MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER BY THE COMBINED EXERTIONS OF PRESBYTERIANS AND ROYALISTS IT COULD BE SAVED
ALMOST ALL THE PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT WERE NOW CONSTITUTED AS THEY HAD BEEN CONSTITUTED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR
BUT WITH THE RESTLESSNESS AND IRRESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC OF ASPIRING MEDIOCRITY AMONG THESE FEEBLE COPIES OF A GREAT ORIGINAL THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS LAMBERT ON THE VERY DAY OF RICHARD'S ACCESSION THE OFFICERS BEGAN TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THEIR NEW MASTER
TO MAKE CHARLES A MONARCH AS ABSOLUTE AS ANY ON THE CONTINENT
THEY WERE AS WELL BORN AS HE AND AS WELL EDUCATED THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
AND CAVERNS OR IF IT WERE BUILT UP
NOT ONLY FROM CONSTITUTION AND FROM HABIT BUT ALSO ON PRINCIPLE HE SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE THEOLOGIANS WHOM HE MOST ESTEEMED THAT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUBJECTS
HE WAS IN TRUTH IMPELLED BY AN INCURABLE PROPENSITY TO DARK AND CROOKED WAYS
I AM A MOTHER SAID SHE AND DEATH STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG HAND TOWARDS THE FINE LITTLE FLOWER
BUT THE OLD MAN WAS GONE AND HER LITTLE CHILD WAS GONE HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM AND THE OLD CLOCK IN THE
AND HAD FORMED A VAST AND DEEPLY MEDITATED SCHEME WHICH VERY NEARLY CONFOUNDED EVEN THE ABLE TACTICS OF THE STATESMEN BY WHOM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN DIRECTED
BUT DARING AND INGENIOUS MEN MIGHT INDEMNIFY THEMSELVES BY TREATING WITH DISDAIN WHAT HAD LATELY BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF NATURE THE TORRENT WHICH HAD BEEN DAMMED UP IN ONE CHANNEL RUSHED VIOLENTLY INTO ANOTHER
DOCTRINE THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD STIMULATED THE FACULTIES OF THE EDUCATED CLASSES AND HAD CALLED FORTH A RESTLESS ACTIVITY AND AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY SUCH AS HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN KNOWN AMONG US
IT WAS PLAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH KEENNESS BUT WITH ADMIRABLE DEXTERITY COOLNESS AND PERSEVERANCE GREAT STATESMEN WHO LOOKED FAR BEHIND THEM AND FAR BEFORE THEM WERE AT THE HEAD OF THAT ASSEMBLY
IT WAS PROBABLE THAT CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD TAKE WARNING BY THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT BE THIS AS IT MIGHT THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED THE COUNTRY
BY RATIFYING THAT LAW HE BOUND HIMSELF NEVER AGAIN TO RAISE MONEY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE HOUSES
AND NOW THOU WILT MAKE ANOTHER MOTHER EQUALLY UNHAPPY ANOTHER MOTHER SAID THE POOR WOMAN AND DIRECTLY
AND THREW THE CHIEFS OF THE OPPOSITION INTO PRISON AT THE SAME TIME A NEW GRIEVANCE WHICH THE PECULIAR FEELINGS AND HABITS OF THE ENGLISH NATION MADE INSUPPORTABLY PAINFUL
HOW THE ONE BECAME A BLESSING TO THE WORLD TO SEE HOW MUCH HAPPINESS AND JOY WERE FELT EVERYWHERE
EVEN IF HE HAD USED ONLY LEGAL AND GENTLE MEANS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ENDS BUT HIS UNDERSTANDING WAS NARROW AND HIS COMMERCE WITH THE WORLD HAD BEEN SMALL HE WAS BY NATURE RASH IRRITABLE
AND BY CHEERFUL RESIGNATION UNDER CRUEL WRONGS AND MISFORTUNES BUT THE CANT THEN
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE WAY HITHER AND WHO HAS HELPED YOU OUR LORD HAS HELPED ME SAID SHE
WHAT YOU SHALL DO MORE I HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE SAID THE AFFLICTED MOTHER BUT I WILL GO TO THE WORLD'S END FOR YOU NAY I HAVE NOTHING TO DO THERE SAID THE WOMAN BUT YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR LONG BLACK HAIR YOU KNOW YOURSELF THAT
AND BEGAN TO TREAT THEM AS SUBJECTS
AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN OVER HER CHEEKS
HAD AT LENGTH PRODUCED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE CAVALIERS AND THE PRESBYTERIANS SOME PRESBYTERIANS HAD INDEED BEEN DISPOSED TO SUCH AN ALLIANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT IT WAS
ROUND ABOUT IT AND IT WAS SO PETTED AND NURSED
KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH INDUCTION AND MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATION COOPERATE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH THAT THE ENGLISH GENIUS WON IN THAT AGE THE MOST MEMORABLE TRIUMPHS
HE GOES FASTER THAN THE WIND AND HE NEVER BRINGS BACK WHAT HE TAKES OH ONLY TELL ME WHICH WAY HE WENT SAID THE MOTHER
THEN HE WILL BE AFRAID
THE GREAT LEADEN WEIGHT RAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUMP AND THEN THE CLOCK ALSO STOOD STILL BUT THE POOR MOTHER RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR HER CHILD
AND OF DOUBLEKEELED SHIPS WHICH WERE NEVER TO FOUNDER IN THE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER PHANTOMS WHICH HAD HAUNTED THE WORLD THROUGH AGES OF DARKNESS FLED BEFORE THE LIGHT ASTROLOGY AND ALCHYMY BECAME JESTS SOON THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH SOME OF THE QUORUM DID NOT SMILE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
SHE THEN CAME TO A LARGE LAKE WHERE THERE WAS NEITHER SHIP NOR BOAT THE LAKE WAS NOT FROZEN SUFFICIENTLY TO BEAR HER NEITHER WAS IT OPEN
ANYTHING WAS PREFERABLE TO THE YOKE OF A SUCCESSION OF INCAPABLE AND INGLORIOUS TYRANTS RAISED TO POWER
MANY ENGLISH KINGS HAD OCCASIONALLY COMMITTED UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS BUT NONE HAD EVER SYSTEMATICALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HIMSELF A DESPOT AND TO REDUCE THE PARLIAMENT TO A NULLITY
REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM ON THE OTHER HAND THOUGH CONSTRUCTED ON SOUND PRINCIPLES WAS NOT POPULAR
SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ANCIENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE REALM THE KING CALLED A THIRD PARLIAMENT AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS STRONGER AND FIERCER THAN EVER
AND NO ONE DARES TO PLUCK THEM UP BEFORE HE GIVES LEAVE
THE POWER WHICH THESE BOARDS HAD POSSESSED BEFORE THE ACCESSION OF CHARLES HAD BEEN EXTENSIVE AND FORMIDABLE BUT HAD BEEN SMALL INDEED WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH THEY NOW USURPED
THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT AN ORDER OF THINGS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HOUSE OF HANOVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HOUSE OF CROMWELL
IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT CHARLES HAD NO INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE COMPACT INTO WHICH HE HAD ENTERED THE SUPPLY GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WAS COLLECTED
AND PUZZLED PHILOSOPHERS CHARLES HIMSELF HAD A LABORATORY AT WHITEHALL AND WAS FAR MORE ACTIVE AND ATTENTIVE
SO TIGHT AND YET AFRAID THAT SHE SHOULD TOUCH ONE OF THE LEAVES THEN DEATH BLEW ON HER HANDS AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS COLDER THAN THE COLD WIND AND HER HANDS FELL DOWN POWERLESS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEE SAID DEATH WILT THOU HAVE THY CHILD AGAIN OR SHALL I GO WITH IT THERE
THIS WAR HASTENED THE APPROACH OF THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE KING SHOULD HAVE A LARGE MILITARY FORCE HE COULD NOT HAVE SUCH A FORCE WITHOUT MONEY
THAT A LARGE PART OF THE REVENUE WAS RAISED WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THAT PERSONS OBNOXIOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT LANGUISHED FOR YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT BEING EVER CALLED UPON TO PLEAD BEFORE ANY TRIBUNAL
STRONG STEMMED PEONIES THERE GREW WATER PLANTS SOME SO FRESH OTHERS HALF SICK
AND THE OLD MAN IT WAS DEATH HIMSELF HE NODDED SO STRANGELY IT COULD JUST AS WELL SIGNIFY YES AS NO
THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS FELL ON HER KNEES
ALL CLASSES WERE HURRIED ALONG BY THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
AND LOOKED AT HER LITTLE SICK CHILD THAT DREW ITS BREATH SO DEEP AND RAISED ITS LITTLE HAND
FOR EMOTIONS OF PIOUS ZEAL UNDER HIS DIRECTION EVERY CORNER OF THE REALM WAS SUBJECTED TO A CONSTANT AND MINUTE INSPECTION EVERY LITTLE CONGREGATION OF SEPARATISTS WAS TRACKED OUT AND BROKEN UP
THAN A CLASS OF COURTS THE MEMORY OF WHICH IS STILL AFTER THE LAPSE OF MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES HELD IN DEEP ABHORRENCE BY THE NATION FOREMOST AMONG THESE COURTS IN POWER AND IN INFAMY WERE THE STAR CHAMBER
EDMUND HALLEY INVESTIGATED THE PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE SEA THE LAWS OF MAGNETISM AND THE COURSE OF THE COMETS NOR DID HE SHRINK FROM TOIL PERIL AND EXILE IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE
AND SET IT ON THE STOVE
JUST AS EVERYONE HAPPENS TO BE SETTLED THEY LOOK LIKE OTHER PLANTS BUT THEY HAVE PULSATIONS OF THE HEART
AND THOU WILT SEE THEIR WHOLE FUTURE LIFE THEIR WHOLE HUMAN EXISTENCE
UNDER A NEW DYNASTY RICHARD WAS SOLEMNLY RECOGNISED AS FIRST MAGISTRATE
BLESS THE BOY HE IS AS HORSEY AS HIS OLD GRANDFATHER BUT DO LOOK AT HIS MOUTH GRANDPAPA AND ASK THE PRICE I AM SURE HE WOULD GROW YOUNG IN OUR MEADOWS
A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE IF A MAN OF BUSINESS HAD TO EXAMINE EVERY CAB HORSE BEFORE HE HIRED IT THE MAN KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS OF COURSE THERE GET IN AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE MY GENTLE FRIEND HAD TO OBEY
I ARCHED MY POOR THIN NECK RAISED MY TAIL A LITTLE AND THREW OUT MY LEGS AS WELL AS I COULD FOR THEY WERE VERY STIFF WHAT IS THE LOWEST YOU WILL TAKE FOR HIM
DO SO I AM NOW GOING THERE THEY WALKED FORWARD AND I WAS LED BEHIND THE BOY COULD HARDLY CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS PLEASURE I HAD A GOOD FEED AT THE INN
AND I MADE A DEAD STOP GO ON BEAUTY SAID MY MASTER AND HE GAVE ME A TOUCH WITH THE WHIP BUT I DARE NOT STIR HE GAVE ME A SHARP CUT I JUMPED BUT I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
BUT I COULD NOT GET ON AND WAS OBLIGED CONTINUALLY TO STOP THIS DID NOT PLEASE MY DRIVER AND HE LAID HIS WHIP ON BADLY GET ON YOU LAZY FELLOW HE SAID OR I'LL MAKE YOU
CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
SAID THE FARMER AS I CAME BACK FIVE POUNDS SIR THAT WAS THE LOWEST PRICE MY MASTER SET TIS A SPECULATION SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SHAKING HIS HEAD
YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
AT THIS SALE OF COURSE I FOUND MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH THE OLD BROKEN DOWN HORSES SOME LAME SOME BROKEN WINDED SOME OLD AND SOME THAT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERCIFUL TO SHOOT
GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
WE MUST NOW BE LOOKING OUT FOR A QUIET GENTEEL PLACE FOR HIM
BUT MY MIND WAS HURT QUITE AS MUCH AS MY POOR SIDES TO BE PUNISHED AND ABUSED WHEN I WAS DOING MY VERY BEST WAS SO HARD IT TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME
SOON BEGAN TO TELL ON MY CONDITION AND MY SPIRITS I HAD A GOOD CONSTITUTION FROM MY MOTHER AND I WAS NEVER STRAINED WHEN I WAS YOUNG SO THAT I HAD A BETTER CHANCE THAN MANY HORSES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKED BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
WERE HARD ON THE HORSES IN THIS PLACE WE HAD NO SUNDAY REST
MY LEGS WERE NOT STIFF NOW AND I DID THE WORK WITH PERFECT EASE HE'S GROWING YOUNG WILLIE WE MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE GENTLE WORK NOW AND BY MID SUMMER HE WILL BE AS GOOD AS LADYBIRD HE HAS A
THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
AND WAS IN A MOMENT AT MY HEAD THAT WAS A VERY NEAR TOUCH SAID MY MASTER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW WELL SIR WE CAN'T DRIVE OVER THAT TREE NOR YET GET ROUND IT
LET IT BE EVER SO STEEP OR THE DAY EVER SO HOT UNLESS INDEED WHEN THE DRIVER WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT MANAGE IT AND SOMETIMES I WAS SO FEVERED AND WORN
GOOD FEED AND FAIR REST WILL KEEP UP ONE'S STRENGTH UNDER FULL WORK BUT NO HORSE CAN STAND AGAINST OVERLOADING AND I WAS GETTING SO THOROUGHLY PULLED DOWN FROM THIS CAUSE
WITH VOICES THAT I COULD TRUST THERE WAS ONE TOTTERING OLD MAN WHO TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO ME AND I TO HIM BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME
I GIVE HIM IN CHARGE TO YOU THE BOY WAS PROUD OF HIS CHARGE AND UNDERTOOK IT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THERE WAS NOT A DAY WHEN HE DID NOT PAY ME A VISIT SOMETIMES PICKING ME OUT FROM AMONG THE OTHER HORSES
AND THANK YOU MA'AM BUT IF HE WENT WITHOUT A CHECK REIN I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF ALL THE CARTERS IT IS THE FASHION YOU SEE IS IT NOT BETTER SHE SAID
TEN DAYS OF PERFECT REST PLENTY OF GOOD OATS HAY BRAN MASHES WITH BOILED LINSEED MIXED IN THEM DID MORE TO GET UP MY CONDITION THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD HAVE DONE
OH HE'S ALL RIGHT MISS SAID MY DRIVER HE'S STRONG ENOUGH THE PORTER WHO WAS PULLING ABOUT SOME HEAVY BOXES SUGGESTED TO THE GENTLEMAN AS THERE WAS SO MUCH LUGGAGE
IT VERY MUCH WEAKENED MY SIGHT AND WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLARE OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO MY EYES SEVERAL TIMES I STUMBLED OVER THE THRESHOLD AND COULD SCARCELY SEE WHERE I WAS GOING
AND NEVER HUNG BACK FOR AS POOR GINGER SAID IT WAS NO USE
I HAVE NO MEADOWS TO NURSE SICK HORSES IN HE MIGHT GET WELL OR HE MIGHT NOT THAT SORT OF THING DON'T SUIT MY BUSINESS MY PLAN IS TO WORK EM AS LONG AS THEY'LL GO AND THEN SELL EM FOR WHAT THEY'LL FETCH
OH GRANDPAPA
AND AS WE CAME UP MISTRESS RAN OUT SAYING ARE YOU REALLY SAFE MY DEAR OH I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS
HE WOULD SAY BUT HE IS IMPROVING SO STEADILY THAT I THINK WE SHALL SEE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN THE SPRING THE PERFECT REST THE GOOD FOOD THE SOFT TURF AND GENTLE EXERCISE
AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
THAT I COULD HARDLY TOUCH MY FOOD HOW I USED TO LONG FOR THE NICE BRAN MASH WITH NITER IN IT THAT JERRY USED TO GIVE US ON SATURDAY NIGHTS IN HOT WEATHER
THE BUYERS AND SELLERS TOO MANY OF THEM LOOKED NOT MUCH BETTER OFF THAN THE POOR BEASTS THEY WERE BARGAINING ABOUT THERE WERE POOR OLD MEN TRYING TO GET A HORSE OR A PONY FOR A FEW POUNDS
AND IN A MOMENT I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO MY VERY KNEES WHAT A COMFORT IT WAS THEN I TOSSED IT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE ACHING STIFFNESS OUT OF MY NECK
MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
LOOK AT HIS MANE AND TAIL I WISH YOU WOULD LOOK INTO HIS MOUTH AND THEN YOU COULD TELL THOUGH HE IS SO VERY THIN HIS EYES ARE NOT SUNK LIKE SOME OLD HORSES THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
HE WOULD ORDER SOMETHING ELSE TO BE TAKEN ON MY CARTER WHOSE NAME WAS JAKES OFTEN SAID IT WAS MORE THAN I OUGHT TO TAKE BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS OVERRULED HIM TWAS NO USE GOING TWICE WHEN ONCE WOULD DO
COULD NOT YOU BUY HIM AND MAKE HIM YOUNG AGAIN AS YOU DID WITH LADYBIRD MY DEAR BOY I CAN'T MAKE ALL OLD HORSES YOUNG BESIDES LADYBIRD WAS NOT SO VERY OLD AS SHE WAS RUN DOWN AND BADLY USED
BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
THAT A YOUNGER HORSE WAS BOUGHT IN MY PLACE I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE WHAT I SUFFERED AT THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD HEARD HORSES SPEAK OF IT BUT HAD NEVER MYSELF HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE EVIL
AND AS THE CURRENT WAS FLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT AND NO HELP AT HAND
THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
TO LEAD A GOOD FASHION THAN TO FOLLOW A BAD ONE A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN DO NOT USE CHECK REINS NOW OUR CARRIAGE HORSES HAVE NOT WORN THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
I WAS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO BE LED BACK TO SKINNER'S STABLES WHERE I THINK THEY DID THE BEST FOR ME THEY COULD IN THE MORNING SKINNER CAME WITH A FARRIER TO LOOK AT ME HE EXAMINED ME VERY CLOSELY AND SAID
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SLOWLY DRAWING OUT HIS PURSE QUITE A SPECULATION HAVE YOU ANY MORE BUSINESS HERE HE SAID COUNTING THE SOVEREIGNS INTO HIS HAND NO SIR
NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
SO BACK WE WENT AND ROUND BY THE CROSSROADS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BRIDGE IT WAS VERY NEARLY DARK WE COULD JUST SEE THAT THE WATER WAS OVER THE MIDDLE OF IT
SOME ONE CAME AND LOOSENED THE THROAT STRAP OF MY BRIDLE AND UNDID THE TRACES WHICH KEPT THE COLLAR SO TIGHT UPON ME SOME ONE SAID HE'S DEAD HE'LL NEVER GET UP AGAIN THEN
WOULD SET HIM RIGHT UP BEING AS HOW HIS WIND WAS NOT BROKEN I'VE HAD THE TENDING OF HIM THESE TEN DAYS PAST AND A GRATEFULLER PLEASANTER ANIMAL I NEVER MET WITH
BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
WHEN THERE WAS A GROAN AND A CRACK AND A SPLITTING SOUND AND TEARING CRASHING DOWN AMONG THE OTHER TREES CAME AN OAK TORN UP BY THE ROOTS AND IT FELL RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEFORE US
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND GOOD PACES THEY CAN'T BE BETTER OH GRANDPAPA HOW GLAD I AM YOU BOUGHT HIM SO AM I MY BOY BUT HE HAS TO THANK YOU MORE THAN ME
THIS WAS A BADLY LIGHTED STABLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL WINDOW AT THE END AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE STALLS WERE ALMOST DARK BESIDES THE DEPRESSING EFFECT THIS HAD ON MY SPIRITS
I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
BUT HERE THERE WAS NO REST AND MY DRIVER WAS JUST AS HARD AS HIS MASTER HE HAD A CRUEL WHIP WITH SOMETHING SO SHARP AT THE END THAT IT SOMETIMES DREW BLOOD
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
AND SOME CORDIAL WAS POURED INTO MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING WAS COVERED OVER ME I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I LAY THERE BUT I FOUND MY LIFE COMING BACK AND A KIND VOICED MAN WAS PATTING ME
AND HE WORE A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHEN HE CAME UP TO ME AND MY COMPANIONS HE STOOD STILL AND GAVE A PITIFUL LOOK ROUND UPON US I SAW HIS EYE REST ON ME
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE HIM KILLED OUT OF HAND BUT HE IS NOT THERE IS A SALE OF HORSES COMING OFF IN ABOUT TEN DAYS IF YOU REST HIM AND FEED HIM UP HE MAY PICK UP AND YOU MAY GET MORE THAN HIS SKIN IS WORTH AT ANY RATE
A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF POVERTY AND HARD TIMES HAD HARDENED THEM ALL OVER BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT I WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY USED THE LAST OF MY STRENGTH IN SERVING POOR AND SHABBY BUT KIND AND HUMAN
THE FARMER SLOWLY FELT MY LEGS WHICH WERE MUCH SWELLED AND STRAINED THEN HE LOOKED AT MY MOUTH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN I SHOULD SAY JUST TROT HIM OUT WILL YOU
SOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY MORNING A PARTY OF FAST MEN WOULD HIRE THE CAB FOR THE DAY FOUR OF THEM INSIDE AND ANOTHER WITH THE DRIVER AND I HAD TO TAKE THEM TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND BACK AGAIN
AND HE WOULD EVEN WHIP ME UNDER THE BELLY AND FLIP THE LASH OUT AT MY HEAD INDIGNITIES LIKE THESE TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME TERRIBLY BUT STILL I DID MY BEST
I PUT OUT MY NOSE IN ANSWER TO HIS KINDNESS THE BOY STROKED MY FACE POOR OLD FELLOW SEE GRANDPAPA HOW WELL HE UNDERSTANDS KINDNESS
AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
BUT AS THAT HAPPENED SOMETIMES WHEN THE FLOODS WERE OUT MASTER DID NOT STOP WE WERE GOING ALONG AT A GOOD PACE BUT THE MOMENT MY FEET TOUCHED THE FIRST PART OF THE BRIDGE I FELT SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
I BELIEVE HAD I STAYED THERE VERY LONG I SHOULD HAVE BECOME PURBLIND AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT A STONE BLIND HORSE WAS SAFER TO DRIVE THAN ONE WHICH HAD IMPERFECT SIGHT
HOWEVER I ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT INJURY TO MY SIGHT
I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
UPON THIS ADVICE SKINNER RATHER UNWILLINGLY I THINK GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL FED AND CARED FOR AND THE STABLE MAN HAPPILY FOR ME CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS
I TROTTED QUIETLY ALONG THE WHEELS HARDLY MAKING A SOUND ON THE SOFT ROAD FOR A GOOD WHILE NEITHER MASTER NOR JOHN SPOKE AND THEN MASTER BEGAN IN A SERIOUS VOICE
AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
SO MY DRIVER PULLED UP AT THE BACK OF SOME OF THE OUTSIDE CABS TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF A RETURN FARE IT WAS A VERY HEAVY TRAIN AND AS ALL THE CABS WERE SOON ENGAGED OURS WAS CALLED FOR
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
POOR OLD FELLOW SAID THE BOY DO YOU THINK GRANDPAPA HE WAS EVER A CARRIAGE HORSE OH YES MY BOY SAID THE FARMER COMING CLOSER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
THE RIVER BANKS WERE RATHER HIGH AND THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF RISING WENT ACROSS JUST LEVEL SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE IF THE RIVER WAS FULL THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY UP TO THE WOODWORK AND PLANKS
OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
BUT IS IT NOT A HEAVY LOAD SHE SAID
SAID SHE PATTING AND STROKING ME WITH HER GENTLE HAND AND NOW IF YOU WILL SPEAK KINDLY TO HIM AND LEAD HIM ON I BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER JAKES TOOK THE REIN COME ON BLACKIE
I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
HE SAID BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FOREMAN CAME JUST AS WE WERE STARTING AND WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDREDWEIGHT MORE PUT ON TO SAVE HIM TROUBLE AND I MUST GET ON WITH IT AS WELL AS I CAN
FEARING SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT SHE HAD SENT JAMES OFF ON JUSTICE THE ROAN COB TOWARD THE WOODEN BRIDGE TO MAKE INQUIRY AFTER US WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE HALL DOOR AND AT THE UPPER WINDOWS
AND WAS THEN GENTLY RIDDEN HOME BY A SERVANT OF MY NEW MASTER'S AND TURNED INTO A LARGE MEADOW WITH A SHED IN ONE CORNER OF IT MISTER THOROUGHGOOD FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF MY BENEFACTOR
AGAIN I STARTED THE HEAVY LOAD AND STRUGGLED ON A FEW YARDS AGAIN THE WHIP CAME DOWN AND AGAIN I STRUGGLED FORWARD THE PAIN OF THAT GREAT CART WHIP WAS SHARP
WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
AND TWOULD BE WORTH A GENTLEMAN'S WHILE TO GIVE A FIVE POUND NOTE FOR HIM AND LET HIM HAVE A CHANCE I'LL BE BOUND HE'D BE WORTH TWENTY POUNDS NEXT SPRING THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED UP EAGERLY
THE SPRING CAME ROUND AND ONE DAY IN MARCH MISTER THOROUGHGOOD DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD TRY ME IN THE PHAETON I WAS WELL PLEASED AND HE AND WILLIE DROVE ME A FEW MILES
HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
AND IF MY MASTER HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON THE PREMISES I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLOADED BUT THERE WAS A FOREMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS HURRYING AND DRIVING EVERY ONE AND FREQUENTLY WHEN I HAD QUITE A FULL LOAD
THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL
AND GIVING ME A BIT OF CARROT OR SOMETHING GOOD OR SOMETIMES STANDING BY ME WHILE I ATE MY OATS HE ALWAYS CAME WITH KIND WORDS AND CARESSES AND OF COURSE I GREW VERY FOND OF HIM
HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
I HAD STILL A GOOD MANE AND TAIL WHICH DID SOMETHING FOR MY APPEARANCE I PRICKED MY EARS AND LOOKED AT HIM THERE'S A HORSE WILLIE THAT HAS KNOWN BETTER DAYS
COMING FROM THE BETTER PART OF THE FAIR I NOTICED A MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YOUNG BOY BY HIS SIDE HE HAD A BROAD BACK AND ROUND SHOULDERS A KIND RUDDY FACE
BUT AS THE MASTER'S BUSINESS ENGAGED HIM A LONG TIME WE DID NOT START FOR HOME TILL RATHER LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND WAS THEN MUCH HIGHER AND I HEARD THE MASTER SAY TO JOHN THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN SUCH A STORM
BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT FEELING IS BELIEVING
THE WIND SEEMED TO HAVE LULLED OFF AFTER THAT FURIOUS BLAST WHICH TORE UP THE TREE IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER STILLER AND STILLER
WHICH WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE BEADLE ON THE CHAIR AND THE COCKED HAT ON THE TABLE WILL YOU GO ALONG WITH ME OLIVER SAID MISTER BUMBLE IN A MAJESTIC VOICE OLIVER WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH ANYBODY WITH GREAT READINESS
HERE HE SEES A BROOK WHOSE LIMPID WATERS LIKE LIQUID CRYSTAL RIPPLE OVER FINE SANDS AND WHITE PEBBLES THAT LOOK LIKE SIFTED GOLD AND PUREST PEARLS THERE HE PERCEIVES A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT FOUNTAIN OF MANY COLOURED JASPER AND POLISHED MARBLE HERE ANOTHER OF RUSTIC FASHION
AND IF THE MAN IS NOT WELL FILLED OR HIS ALFORJAS WELL STORED THERE HE MAY STAY AS VERY OFTEN HE DOES TURNED INTO A DRIED MUMMY THOU ART IN THE RIGHT OF IT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE GO WHERE THOU WILT AND EAT ALL THOU CANST
AND GRATITUDE THAT CONSISTS OF DISPOSITION ONLY IS A DEAD THING JUST AS FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD FOR THIS REASON I SHOULD BE GLAD WERE FORTUNE SOON TO OFFER ME SOME OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING MYSELF AN EMPEROR SO AS TO SHOW MY HEART IN DOING GOOD TO MY FRIENDS
THEY STOOD STILL AND PREPARED TO BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL EVERYTHING BEFORE THEM WAS ON A PERFECT LEVEL THE SUN RESTING ON THE HORIZON LINE STREAMED ACROSS THE GROUND FROM BETWEEN COPPER COLOURED AND LILAC CLOUDS
AND A DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF GREEN LEAFY TREES PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE EYES AND CHARMS THE SIGHT WITH ITS VERDURE WHILE THE EAR IS SOOTHED BY THE SWEET UNTUTORED MELODY OF THE COUNTLESS BIRDS OF GAY PLUMAGE THAT FLIT TO AND FRO AMONG THE INTERLACING BRANCHES
THOUGH I MAY SEEM TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD WITHOUT BEING ASKED I WILL IF IT WILL NOT TIRE YOU GENTLEMEN AND YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION FOR A LITTLE TELL YOU A TRUE STORY WHICH WILL CONFIRM THIS GENTLEMAN'S WORD AND HE POINTED TO THE CURATE AS WELL AS MY OWN
AND THE NEXT VILKINS I HAVE GOT NAMES READY MADE TO THE END OF THE ALPHABET AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT AGAIN WHEN WE COME TO Z WHY YOU'RE QUITE A LITERARY CHARACTER SIR SAID MISSUS MANN WELL WELL SAID THE BEADLE
I DRINK YOUR HEALTH WITH CHEERFULNESS MISSUS MANN AND HE SWALLOWED HALF OF IT AND NOW ABOUT BUSINESS SAID THE BEADLE TAKING OUT A LEATHERN POCKET BOOK THE CHILD THAT WAS HALF BAPTIZED OLIVER TWIST IS NINE YEAR OLD TO DAY
RISING UPWARDS AND DANCING ABOUT LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE O
THAT IT WAS YOU A COMING REPLIED MISSUS MANN WITH GREAT HUMILITY MISTER BUMBLE HAD A GREAT IDEA OF HIS ORATORICAL POWERS AND HIS IMPORTANCE HE HAD DISPLAYED THE ONE AND VINDICATED THE OTHER HE RELAXED
WELL WELL MISSUS MANN HE REPLIED IN A CALMER TONE IT MAY BE AS YOU SAY IT MAY BE LEAD THE WAY IN MISSUS MANN FOR I COME ON BUSINESS AND HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
AND THEN WHEN THE REPAST IS OVER AND THE TABLES REMOVED FOR THE KNIGHT TO RECLINE IN THE CHAIR PICKING HIS TEETH PERHAPS AS USUAL AND A DAMSEL MUCH LOVELIER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS TO ENTER UNEXPECTEDLY BY THE CHAMBER DOOR AND HERSELF BY HIS SIDE
YOU GIVE UP YOUR WHOLE THOUGHT YOU SET YOUR WHOLE SOUL TO PLEASE A WOMAN I DO AND THAT WOMAN IS YOU HOW CAN YOU TREAT ME SO FLIPPANTLY SAID HIS MOTHER TURNING AGAIN TO HIM WITH A TEARFUL LOOK
I HAVE BEEN TOLD AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING SHE SAID MOURNFULLY THE CAPTAIN HAS LET OUT AT THE WOMAN THAT YOU AND EUSTACIA VYE ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED WE ARE SAID YEOBRIGHT BUT IT MAY NOT BE YET FOR A VERY LONG TIME
YOU ARE UNNATURAL CLYM AND I DID NOT EXPECT IT VERY LIKELY SAID HE CHEERLESSLY YOU DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE YOU WERE GOING TO METE ME AND THEREFORE DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE RETURNED TO YOU AGAIN
AS THEY WERE EATING THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE SOUND OF A BELL THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM AMONG SOME BRAMBLES AND THICK BUSHES THAT WERE CLOSE BY AND THE SAME INSTANT THEY OBSERVED A BEAUTIFUL GOAT SPOTTED ALL OVER BLACK WHITE AND BROWN SPRING OUT OF THE THICKET
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF IT THERE WAS SOMETHING QUEER BETWEEN HER AND THOMASIN'S HUSBAND AT ONE TIME I AM AS SURE OF IT AS THAT I STAND HERE EUSTACIA HAS TOLD ME HE DID PAY HER A LITTLE ATTENTION A YEAR AGO BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT
I KNEW SHE WAS SURE TO COME SHE VANISHED IN A HOLLOW FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HER WHOLE FORM UNFOLDED ITSELF FROM THE BRAKE ONLY YOU HERE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR WHOSE HOLLOWNESS WAS PROVED BY HER RISING REDNESS AND HER HALF GUILTY LOW LAUGH
WITHOUT PAUSING TO REFLECT UPON THE DANGER TO WHICH HE IS EXPOSING HIMSELF
THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD ALWAYS OPENED THE BODY AND FOUND NOTHING INSIDE WHICH WAS VERY PROBABLE INDEED AND THE LATTER OF WHOM INVARIABLY SWORE WHATEVER THE PARISH WANTED WHICH WAS VERY SELF DEVOTIONAL BESIDES THE BOARD MADE PERIODICAL PILGRIMAGES TO THE FARM
QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
SUDDENLY THERE IS PRESENTED TO HIS SIGHT A STRONG CASTLE OR GORGEOUS PALACE WITH WALLS OF MASSY GOLD TURRETS OF DIAMOND AND GATES OF JACINTH IN SHORT SO MARVELLOUS IS ITS STRUCTURE
AND WILL RETREAT WITH THIS PASTY TO THE BROOK THERE
THE POOR MAN IS INCAPACITATED FROM SHOWING THE VIRTUE OF GENEROSITY TO ANYONE
IN THE MINOR VALLEYS BETWEEN THE HILLOCKS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE CONTOUR OF THE VALE THE FRESH YOUNG FERNS WERE LUXURIANTLY GROWING UP ULTIMATELY TO REACH A HEIGHT OF FIVE OR SIX FEET HE DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY
PLEASURE NOT KNOWN BEFOREHAND IS HALF WASTED TO ANTICIPATE IT IS TO DOUBLE IT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ONCE TODAY OF HAVING YOU ALL TO MYSELF THIS AFTERNOON AND THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF A THING IS SO SOON GONE IT IS INDEED
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING RICH BUT WITH MY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AS NEW AS IT IS TRUE I SHALL DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO MY FELLOW CREATURES DREAMS DREAMS
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS OPPRESSIVE HORIZONTALITY WHICH TOO MUCH REMINDED HIM OF THE ARENA OF LIFE IT GAVE HIM A SENSE OF BARE EQUALITY WITH AND NO SUPERIORITY TO A SINGLE LIVING THING UNDER THE SUN
MY HEART ALIVE MISTER BUMBLE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU SURE LY NOW MISTER BUMBLE WAS A FAT MAN AND A CHOLERIC SO INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO THIS OPEN HEARTED SALUTATION IN A KINDRED SPIRIT HE GAVE THE LITTLE WICKET A TREMENDOUS SHAKE
FIVE SHARP WORDS ARE SPOKEN AND A CRISIS ENSUES WHEN YEOBRIGHT WAS NOT WITH EUSTACIA HE WAS SITTING SLAVISHLY OVER HIS BOOKS WHEN HE WAS NOT READING HE WAS MEETING HER
MISSUS MANN USHERED THE BEADLE INTO A SMALL PARLOUR WITH A BRICK FLOOR PLACED A SEAT FOR HIM AND OFFICIOUSLY DEPOSITED HIS COCKED HAT AND CANE ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM MISTER BUMBLE WIPED FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE PERSPIRATION WHICH HIS WALK HAD ENGENDERED
AND THEN BESTOWED UPON IT A KICK WHICH COULD HAVE EMANATED FROM NO LEG BUT A BEADLE'S LOR ONLY THINK SAID MISSUS MANN RUNNING OUT FOR THE THREE BOYS HAD BEEN REMOVED BY THIS TIME
FROM THE HIGH INTELLIGENCE THEY POSSESS AND THEIR LOVE OF CURIOUS NOVELTIES THAT INTEREST CHARM AND ENTERTAIN THE MIND AS I FEEL QUITE SURE YOUR STORY WILL DO SO BEGIN FRIEND FOR WE ARE ALL PREPARED TO LISTEN I DRAW MY STAKES SAID SANCHO
AND FORTUNE THWART ME NOT TO SEE MYSELF KING OF SOME KINGDOM
THEY LEAD HIM TO ANOTHER CHAMBER WHERE HE FINDS THE TABLES SET OUT IN SUCH STYLE THAT HE IS FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THEY POUR OUT WATER FOR HIS HANDS DISTILLED FROM AMBER AND SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS HOW THEY SEAT HIM ON AN IVORY CHAIR
AND HERE CAPACITY AND SOUND JUDGMENT COME IN AND ABOVE ALL A FIRM DETERMINATION TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH FOR IF THIS BE WANTING IN THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE AND THE END WILL ALWAYS GO WRONG AND GOD AS COMMONLY AIDS THE HONEST INTENTIONS OF THE SIMPLE AS HE FRUSTRATES THE EVIL DESIGNS OF THE CRAFTY
I AM ONLY AT AN AWKWARD TURNING I WISH PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE SO READY TO THINK THAT THERE IS NO PROGRESS WITHOUT UNIFORMITY AH YOUR MIND RUNS OFF TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL SIDE OF IT WELL
AND I SHALL BE AS MUCH KING OF MY REALM AS ANY OTHER OF HIS AND BEING SO I SHOULD DO AS I LIKED AND DOING AS I LIKED I SHOULD PLEASE MYSELF AND PLEASING MYSELF I SHOULD BE CONTENT
AND THE INCIPIENT MARKS OF TIME AND THOUGHT WERE LESS PERCEPTIBLE THAN WHEN HE RETURNED THE HEALTHFUL AND ENERGETIC STURDINESS WHICH WAS HIS BY NATURE HAVING PARTIALLY RECOVERED ITS ORIGINAL PROPORTIONS THEY WANDERED ONWARD TILL THEY REACHED THE NETHER MARGIN OF THE HEATH
WHEN THERE WAS SOME MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING INQUEST UPON A PARISH CHILD WHO HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED IN TURNING UP A BEDSTEAD OR INADVERTENTLY SCALDED TO DEATH WHEN THERE HAPPENED TO BE A WASHING THOUGH THE LATTER ACCIDENT WAS VERY SCARCE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A WASHING BEING OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE FARM
KEEP A SCHOOL IN BUDMOUTH AS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT'S INCREDIBLE THE PLACE IS OVERRUN WITH SCHOOLMASTERS YOU HAVE NO SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS WHAT POSSIBLE CHANCE IS THERE FOR SUCH AS YOU
MINGLED WITH FRAGMENTS OF GLITTERING CRYSTAL AND MOCK EMERALDS MAKE UP A WORK OF VARIED ASPECT WHERE ART
YOU ANSWER ME YOU THINK ONLY OF HER YOU STICK TO HER IN ALL THINGS THAT PROVES HER TO BE WORTHY I HAVE NEVER YET SUPPORTED WHAT IS BAD AND I DO NOT CARE ONLY FOR HER I CARE FOR YOU
HERE NOW DISPLAYED BEFORE US A VAST LAKE OF BUBBLING PITCH WITH A HOST OF SNAKES AND SERPENTS AND LIZARDS AND FEROCIOUS AND TERRIBLE CREATURES OF ALL SORTS SWIMMING ABOUT IN IT WHILE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE THERE COMES A PLAINTIVE VOICE SAYING
WHO HAD GONE TO THE INN TO FETCH THE SUMPTER MULE HAD RETURNED AND MAKING A CARPET AND THE GREEN GRASS OF THE MEADOW SERVE AS A TABLE THEY SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE SHADE OF SOME TREES AND MADE THEIR REPAST THERE THAT THE CARTER MIGHT NOT BE DEPRIVED OF THE ADVANTAGE OF THE SPOT AS HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID
ELSE THOU SHALT NOT BE WORTHY TO SEE THE MIGHTY WONDERS CONTAINED IN THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE SEVEN FAYS THAT LIE BENEATH THIS BLACK EXPANSE AND THEN THE KNIGHT ALMOST ERE THE AWFUL VOICE HAS CEASED WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER
CLYM TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS ALREADY BARED FOR HIM IT WAS A FAVOURITE WAY WITH THEM TO WALK BARE HAND IN BARE HAND AND LED HER THROUGH THE FERNS THEY FORMED A VERY COMELY PICTURE OF LOVE AT FULL FLUSH AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE VALLEY THAT LATE AFTERNOON
A BEING TO FIGHT FOR SUPPORT HELP BE MALIGNED FOR
THAT IS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD NO PRELIMINARY TRAINING MY PLAN IS ONE FOR INSTILLING HIGH KNOWLEDGE INTO EMPTY MINDS WITHOUT FIRST CRAMMING THEM WITH WHAT HAS TO BE UNCRAMMED AGAIN BEFORE TRUE STUDY BEGINS
FOR BEING A FEMALE AS YOU SAY SHE WILL FOLLOW HER NATURAL INSTINCT IN SPITE OF ALL YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT IT TAKE THIS MORSEL AND DRINK A SUP AND THAT WILL SOOTHE YOUR IRRITATION AND IN THE MEANTIME THE GOAT WILL REST HERSELF AND SO SAYING
REPLIED MISSUS MANN AS SHE OPENED A CORNER CUPBOARD AND TOOK DOWN A BOTTLE AND GLASS IT'S GIN I'LL NOT DECEIVE YOU MISTER B IT'S GIN DO YOU GIVE THE CHILDREN DAFFY MISSUS MANN INQUIRED BUMBLE FOLLOWING WITH HIS EYES THE INTERESTING PROCESS OF MIXING
THEN SHE REPLIED BEST IS IT BEST FOR YOU TO INJURE YOUR PROSPECTS FOR SUCH A VOLUPTUOUS IDLE WOMAN AS THAT DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY THE VERY FACT OF YOUR CHOOSING HER YOU PROVE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU
GLOOMILY PONDERING HE DISCERNED ABOVE THE FERNS A DRAWN BONNET OF WHITE SILK APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT AND YEOBRIGHT KNEW DIRECTLY THAT IT COVERED THE HEAD OF HER HE LOVED HIS HEART AWOKE FROM ITS APATHY TO A WARM EXCITEMENT AND JUMPING TO HIS FEET HE SAID ALOUD

UPON THIS THE PARISH AUTHORITIES MAGNANIMOUSLY AND HUMANELY RESOLVED THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE FARMED OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE SHOULD BE DISPATCHED TO A BRANCH WORKHOUSE SOME THREE MILES OFF
HERE SHE SET DOWN THE GLASS I SHALL TAKE A EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF MENTIONING IT TO THE BOARD MISSUS MANN HE DREW IT TOWARDS HIM YOU FEEL AS A MOTHER MISSUS MANN HE STIRRED THE GIN AND WATER I

A CERTAIN GLAD AND VOLUPTUOUS AIR OF TRIUMPH PERVADING HER EYES AT HAVING WON BY HER OWN UNAIDED SELF A MAN WHO WAS HER PERFECT COMPLEMENT IN ATTAINMENT APPEARANCE AND AGE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S PART

THESE MEETINGS WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY ONE AFTERNOON HIS MOTHER CAME HOME FROM A MORNING VISIT TO THOMASIN
AFTER PARTICIPATING WITH HIM IN A SOUND THRASHING HAD BEEN LOCKED UP FOR ATROCIOUSLY PRESUMING TO BE HUNGRY WHEN MISSUS MANN THE GOOD LADY OF THE HOUSE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED BY THE APPARITION OF MISTER BUMBLE THE BEADLE STRIVING TO UNDO THE WICKET OF THE GARDEN GATE
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE FEMALE TO WHOSE PROTECTING CARE OLIVER TWIST WAS DELIVERED OVER A SIMILAR RESULT USUALLY ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF HER SYSTEM
WHERE IS MISSUS YEOBRIGHT SHE HAS NOT COME HE REPLIED IN A SUBDUED TONE I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE ALONE SHE SAID SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH AN IDLE PLEASANT TIME AS THIS
THE LUMINOUS RAYS WRAPPED HER UP WITH HER INCREASING DISTANCE AND THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS OVER THE SPROUTING SEDGE AND GRASS DIED AWAY AS HE WATCHED THE DEAD FLAT OF THE SCENERY OVERPOWERED HIM
WOULD YOUR GRANDFATHER ALLOW YOU I THINK HE WOULD ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT SHOULD NOT LAST LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS I WILL GUARANTEE THAT IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS
THAT THOUGH THE MATERIALS OF WHICH IT IS BUILT ARE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS CARBUNCLES RUBIES PEARLS GOLD AND EMERALDS
HAVING HAD BY THIS TIME AS MUCH OF THE OUTER COAT OF DIRT WHICH ENCRUSTED HIS FACE AND HANDS REMOVED AS COULD BE SCRUBBED OFF IN ONE WASHING WAS LED INTO THE ROOM BY HIS BENEVOLENT PROTECTRESS MAKE A BOW TO THE GENTLEMAN OLIVER SAID MISSUS MANN OLIVER MADE A BOW
EVIDENTLY GRATIFIED WITH THE COMPLIMENT PERHAPS I MAY BE PERHAPS I MAY BE MISSUS MANN HE FINISHED THE GIN AND WATER AND ADDED OLIVER BEING NOW TOO OLD TO REMAIN HERE THE BOARD HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM BACK INTO THE HOUSE
WHEN HE MADE HIS SQUIRE COUNT OF THE INSULA FIRME AND SO WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE I CAN MAKE A COUNT OF SANCHO PANZA FOR HE IS ONE OF THE BEST SQUIRES THAT EVER KNIGHT ERRANT HAD THE CANON WAS ASTONISHED AT THE METHODICAL NONSENSE
WHO PLUNGED INTO THE BOILING LAKE BY THE HAND AND WITHOUT ADDRESSING A WORD TO HIM LEADS HIM INTO THE RICH PALACE OR CASTLE AND STRIPS HIM AS NAKED AS WHEN HIS MOTHER BORE HIM AND BATHES HIM IN LUKEWARM WATER AND ANOINTS HIM ALL OVER WITH SWEET SMELLING UNGUENTS
AND THE MOIST HOLLOWS OF THE HEATH HAD PASSED FROM THEIR BROWN TO THEIR GREEN STAGE YEOBRIGHT WALKED TO THE EDGE OF THE BASIN WHICH EXTENDED DOWN FROM MISTOVER AND RAINBARROW BY THIS TIME HE WAS CALM AND HE LOOKED OVER THE LANDSCAPE
FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN IN A SPOT WHERE A PATH EMERGED FROM ONE OF THE SMALL HOLLOWS AND WAITED HITHER IT WAS THAT HE HAD PROMISED EUSTACIA TO BRING HIS MOTHER THIS AFTERNOON THAT THEY MIGHT MEET AND BE FRIENDS HIS ATTEMPT HAD UTTERLY FAILED
GOODNESS GRACIOUS IS THAT YOU MISTER BUMBLE SIR SAID MISSUS MANN THRUSTING HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW IN WELL AFFECTED ECSTASIES OF JOY SUSAN TAKE OLIVER AND THEM TWO BRATS UPSTAIRS AND WASH EM DIRECTLY
YOU'VE HAD A LONG WALK YOU KNOW OR I WOULDN'T MENTION IT NOW WILL YOU TAKE A LITTLE DROP OF SOMETHINK MISTER BUMBLE NOT A DROP NOR A DROP SAID MISTER BUMBLE WAVING HIS RIGHT HAND IN A DIGNIFIED BUT PLACID MANNER
HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE HUNGRY AND DESTITUTE SITUATION OF THE INFANT ORPHAN WAS DULY REPORTED BY THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES TO THE PARISH AUTHORITIES THE PARISH AUTHORITIES INQUIRED WITH DIGNITY OF THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
AND AFTER HAVING SEEN ALL THIS WHAT CAN BE MORE CHARMING THAN TO SEE HOW A BEVY OF DAMSELS COMES FORTH FROM THE GATE OF THE CASTLE IN GAY AND GORGEOUS ATTIRE SUCH THAT WERE I TO SET MYSELF NOW TO DEPICT IT AS THE HISTORIES DESCRIBE IT TO US I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
WHETHER THERE WAS NO FEMALE THEN DOMICILED IN THE HOUSE WHO WAS IN A SITUATION TO IMPART TO OLIVER TWIST THE CONSOLATION AND NOURISHMENT OF WHICH HE STOOD IN NEED THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES REPLIED WITH HUMILITY THAT THERE WAS NOT
FOR IF YOU WHO OUGHT TO KEEP AND LEAD THEM GO WANDERING ASTRAY WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM
YOU HAVE COME ONLY TO DISTRESS ME A LONELY WOMAN AND SHORTEN MY DAYS I WISH THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE WHERE YOU BESTOW YOUR LOVE CLYM SAID HUSKILY YOU ARE MY MOTHER I WILL SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS
STRETCHED OUT IN FLATS BENEATH A SKY OF PALE SOFT GREEN ALL DARK OBJECTS ON THE EARTH THAT LAY TOWARDS THE SUN WERE OVERSPREAD BY A PURPLE HAZE AGAINST WHICH GROUPS OF WAILING GNATS SHONE OUT
RETURNED SANCHO PANZA ALL I KNOW IS I WOULD I HAD THE COUNTY AS SOON AS I SHALL KNOW HOW TO GOVERN IT
FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT
SO SHE APPROPRIATED THE GREATER PART OF THE WEEKLY STIPEND TO HER OWN USE AND CONSIGNED THE RISING PAROCHIAL GENERATION TO EVEN A SHORTER ALLOWANCE THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED FOR THEM THEREBY FINDING IN THE LOWEST DEPTH A DEEPER STILL
OLIVER TWIST'S NINTH BIRTHDAY FOUND HIM A PALE THIN CHILD SOMEWHAT DIMINUTIVE IN STATURE AND DECIDEDLY SMALL IN CIRCUMFERENCE BUT NATURE OR INHERITANCE HAD IMPLANTED A GOOD STURDY SPIRIT IN OLIVER'S BREAST IT HAD HAD PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXPAND
THE AIR WAS WARM WITH A VAPOROUS WARMTH AND THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN
BUT FOR ALL THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID ON THIS MATTER OF COUNTIES TO WHICH DON QUIXOTE RETURNED I KNOW NOT WHAT MORE THERE IS TO BE SAID I ONLY GUIDE MYSELF BY THE EXAMPLE SET ME
TRUST ME I AM ADVISING YOU NOW TO ACT AS A SENSIBLE MAN SHOULD ONLY READ THEM AND YOU WILL SEE THE PLEASURE YOU WILL DERIVE FROM THEM FOR COME TELL ME CAN THERE BE ANYTHING MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN TO SEE AS IT WERE
ALTHOUGH THIS INVITATION WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A CURTSEY THAT MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED THE HEART OF A CHURCH WARDEN IT BY NO MEANS MOLLIFIED THE BEADLE DO YOU THINK THIS RESPECTFUL OR PROPER CONDUCT MISSUS MANN INQUIRED MISTER BUMBLE GRASPING HIS CANE
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
HIS FEELINGS WERE HIGH THE MOMENT WAS PASSIONATE AND HE CUT THE KNOT YOU SHALL BE SURE OF ME DARLING HE SAID FOLDING HER IN HIS ARMS WE WILL BE MARRIED AT ONCE O CLYM DO YOU AGREE TO IT
TO THIS DON QUIXOTE REPLIED
THEY CANNOT NOBODY DARES TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF YOU OR OF ME OH HOW I WISH I WAS SURE OF NEVER LOSING YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT BE ABLE TO DESERT ME ANYHOW CLYM STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
IF NONSENSE BE CAPABLE OF METHOD THAT DON QUIXOTE UTTERED
THE BEADLE DREW HIMSELF UP WITH GREAT PRIDE AND SAID
AND ALWAYS SENT THE BEADLE THE DAY BEFORE TO SAY THEY WERE GOING THE CHILDREN WERE NEAT AND CLEAN TO BEHOLD WHEN THEY WENT AND WHAT MORE WOULD THE PEOPLE HAVE IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THIS SYSTEM OF FARMING WOULD PRODUCE ANY VERY EXTRAORDINARY OR LUXURIANT CROP
IF IF WE CAN WE CERTAINLY CAN BOTH BEING OF FULL AGE AND I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED MY OCCUPATION ALL THESE YEARS WITHOUT HAVING ACCUMULATED MONEY AND IF YOU WILL AGREE TO LIVE IN A TINY COTTAGE SOMEWHERE ON THE HEATH
WHAT HAS HER LIFE BEEN HER SURNAME EVEN IS NOT HER TRUE ONE SHE IS CAPTAIN VYE'S GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER FATHER MERELY TOOK HER MOTHER'S NAME AND SHE IS A LADY BY INSTINCT
SHE REPEATED SLOWLY WHICH IS NOT LIKELY DEAREST FIX THE EXACT DAY AND THEN THEY CONSULTED ON THE QUESTION AND THE DAY WAS CHOSEN IT WAS TO BE A FORTNIGHT FROM THAT TIME
HE WAS IN A NEST OF VIVID GREEN THE FERNY VEGETATION ROUND HIM THOUGH SO ABUNDANT WAS QUITE UNIFORM IT WAS A GROVE OF MACHINE MADE FOLIAGE A WORLD OF GREEN TRIANGLES WITH SAW EDGES AND NOT A SINGLE FLOWER
TO KEEP THE PARISH OFFICERS A WAITING AT YOUR GARDEN GATE WHEN THEY COME HERE UPON POROCHIAL BUSINESS WITH THE POROCHIAL ORPHANS ARE YOU AWEER MISSUS MANN THAT YOU ARE AS I MAY SAY A POROCHIAL DELEGATE AND A STIPENDIARY I'M SURE MISTER BUMBLE
TO SEE HOW THE DAMSELS WAIT ON HIM ALL IN PROFOUND SILENCE HOW THEY BRING HIM SUCH A VARIETY OF DAINTIES SO TEMPTINGLY PREPARED THAT THE APPETITE IS AT A LOSS WHICH TO SELECT TO HEAR THE MUSIC THAT RESOUNDS WHILE HE IS AT TABLE BY WHOM OR WHENCE PRODUCED HE KNOWS NOT
WHERE TWENTY OR THIRTY OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGAINST THE POOR LAWS ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR ALL DAY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF TOO MUCH FOOD OR TOO MUCH CLOTHING UNDER THE PARENTAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF AN ELDERLY FEMALE
WHATEVER YOU DO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME THAT YOU KNOW BUT ONE THING I HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT AT MY AGE I AM OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR ME MISSUS YEOBRIGHT REMAINED FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND SHAKEN AS IF SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
THANKS TO THE SPARE DIET OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PERHAPS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED HIS HAVING ANY NINTH BIRTH DAY AT ALL BE THIS AS IT MAY HOWEVER IT WAS HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY AND HE WAS KEEPING IT IN THE COAL CELLAR WITH A SELECT PARTY OF TWO OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO
THEY CALL HIM CAPTAIN BUT ANYBODY IS CAPTAIN HE WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY NO DOUBT HE HAS BEEN TO SEA IN SOME TUB OR OTHER WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AFTER HER
THE SUN SLOPING DOWN ON THEIR RIGHT AND THROWING THEIR THIN SPECTRAL SHADOWS TALL AS POPLAR TREES FAR OUT ACROSS THE FURZE AND FERN
GLANCED COMPLACENTLY AT THE COCKED HAT AND SMILED YES HE SMILED BEADLES ARE BUT MEN AND MISTER BUMBLE SMILED NOW DON'T YOU BE OFFENDED AT WHAT I'M A GOING TO SAY OBSERVED MISSUS MANN WITH CAPTIVATING SWEETNESS
CHAPTER TWO TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS OLIVER WAS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION
I HAVE FEARED MY BLISS SHE SAID WITH THE MEREST MOTION OF HER LIPS IT HAS BEEN TOO INTENSE AND CONSUMING THERE IS HOPE YET THERE ARE FORTY YEARS OF WORK IN ME YET AND WHY SHOULD YOU DESPAIR
HE HANDED HIM THE LOINS OF A COLD RABBIT ON A FORK THE GOATHERD TOOK IT WITH THANKS AND DRANK AND CALMED HIMSELF AND THEN SAID
WHO HAD A SON CALLED CIENZO IT HAPPENED THAT CIENZO WAS ONE DAY THROWING STONES ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES AND BY CHANCE BROKE HIS COMPANION'S HEAD WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER
HERE I STAND AND LET A RASCALLY THIEF CHEAT ME OUT OF MY TRUMP CARD SO SAYING HE TOOK AN INKSTAND SEIZED A PEN AND SPREADING OUT A SHEET OF PAPER BEGAN TO WRITE TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWEL OF WOMEN MENECHELLA
BUT BESIDE ALL THOSE OF WHOM YOU MAY HAVE HEARD I WILL NOW TELL YOU OF ANOTHER TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HEARTLESS STEPMOTHERS WHOM YOU WILL CONSIDER WELL DESERVING THE PUNISHMENT SHE PURCHASED FOR HERSELF WITH READY MONEY
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
SINCE HE HAS HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL YOU A BOUNCING LIE BUT TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE DONE THE DEED AND NOT THIS RASCAL ORDER THE HEADS TO BE PRODUCED NONE OF THEM CAN SPEAK TO THE PROOF WITHOUT A TONGUE AND THESE I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME AS WITNESSES TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE TRUTH
WHEN NENNELLA SAW HIM THROUGH THE FISH'S THROAT SHE CRIED ALOUD BROTHER BROTHER YOUR TASK IS DONE THE TABLES ARE LAID OUT EVERY ONE BUT HERE IN THE FISH I MUST SIT AND SIGH O BROTHER WITHOUT YOU I SOON SHALL DIE
THEN THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO GO NEARER TO THE FISH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR PERHAPS THIS ADVENTURE MIGHT CONCERN HIM AS SOON AS NENNILLO APPROACHED THE FISH IT RAISED UP ITS HEAD UPON THE ROCK AND OPENING ITS THROAT SIX PALMS WIDE
THAT HE CREPT INTO A HOLLOW TREE AND NENNELLA SET OFF RUNNING AT FULL SPEED AND RAN UNTIL SHE CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND FOUND HERSELF ON THE SEASHORE NOW IT HAPPENED THAT SOME PIRATES WHO HAD LANDED THERE TO GET FUEL SAW NENNELLA AND CARRIED HER OFF
WHERE IS THE COUNTERPANE REPLIED THE OGRE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO THE FLOOR HE TOUCHED CORVETTO'S FACE WHEREUPON HE SET UP A LOUD CRY THE IMP THE IMP HOLLO HERE LIGHTS RUN QUICKLY
WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH PREPARING THE FEAST THEN CORVETTO ENTERING WITH A LOOK OF COMPASSION SAID GOOD DAY MY GOOD WOMAN
AFTER A WHILE HE ARRIVED AT A WILD AND DREARY FOREST SO DARK THAT IT MADE YOU SHUDDER THERE UPON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE FOUND A FAIRY SURROUNDED BY A BAND OF ROBBERS CIENZO SEEING THE WICKED INTENTION OF THE ROBBERS
AND STUPOR IS IN DELIGHT THE KING WHO HAD A FRUITFUL BRAIN WHICH CONCEIVED QUICKLY CALLED CORVETTO AGAIN AND TELLING HIM THE GREAT LONGING THAT HAD SEIZED HIM FOR THE OGRE'S PALACE BEGGED HIM TO ADD THIS SERVICE TO ALL THE OTHERS HE HAD DONE HIM
CANST ASSURE THE KING OF THE TRUTH AND PREVENT HIS ALLOWING ANOTHER TO GAIN THIS REWARD WHILE I HAVE HAD ALL THE TOIL FOR IT WILL BE THE RIGHT EFFECT OF THY FAIR ROYAL GRACE AND THE MERITED RECOMPENSE OF THIS STRONG HERO'S FIST IN CONCLUSION
AS CORVETTO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO SERVE YOU IT WOULD BE NO GREAT MATTER FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A SIGNAL PLEASURE TO GET THE OGRE'S PALACE WHICH IS FIT FOR AN EMPEROR TO LIVE IN FOR IT HAS SO MANY ROOMS AND CHAMBERS INSIDE AND OUT
WILL GIVE YOU SHELTER FROM THE SUN WHERE THE RIVER MORE CHARITABLE WILL GIVE YOU DRINK WITHOUT POISON AND THE EARTH MORE KIND WILL GIVE YOU A PILLOW OF GRASS WITHOUT DANGER AND WHEN YOU WANT FOOD FOLLOW THIS LITTLE PATH OF BRAN WHICH I HAVE MADE FOR YOU IN A STRAIGHT LINE
THESE AND OTHER WORDS FELL FROM THEIR MOUTHS LIKE POISONED ARROWS AIMED AT THE RUIN OF CORVETTO AS AT A TARGET ALAS FOR HIM WHO IS CONDEMNED TO THAT DEN THE COURT WHERE FLATTERY IS SOLD BY THE KILDERKIN
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FALSE LOON
AND TO ENJOY THE COOL SEA BREEZES AND WHILST A GREAT BANQUET WAS PREPARING NENNILLO HAD STEPPED OUT UPON A BALCONY OF THE PALACE ON THE ROCK TO SHARPEN SOME KNIVES PRIDING HIMSELF GREATLY ON ACQUIRING HONOUR FROM HIS OFFICE
HE CAME AT LAST TO THE PALACE OF A KING WHICH WAS ALL HUNG WITH MOURNING SO THAT IT MADE ONE'S HEART BLACK TO LOOK AT IT WHEN CIENZO INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THE MOURNING THE FOLKS ANSWERED A DRAGON WITH SEVEN HEADS HAS MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
WISHED TO CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND THE LADDER WHEREAT HE SET UP SUCH A CRY
BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
KNOWING HOWEVER THAT WALLS ARE NOT LEVELLED BY THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE BATTERING RAM THEY RESOLVED TO TRY THEIR LUCK A SECOND TIME AND SAID TO THE KING WE WISH YOU JOY OF THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE IT WILL INDEED BE AN ORNAMENT TO THE ROYAL STABLE
TO HAVE ALL THIS TROUBLE AND BE FOR EVER TEASED BY A COUPLE OF SQUALLING BRATS WOULD THAT I HAD BROKEN MY NECK ERE I EVER CAME TO THIS PLACE TO HAVE BAD FOOD WORSE DRINK AND GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
THE NEWS OF THIS PROCLAMATION FLEW THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY TILL AT LAST IT CAME TO THE EARS OF CIENZO WHO SAID TO HIMSELF VERILY I AM A GREAT BLOCKHEAD I HAD HOLD OF FORTUNE BY THE FORELOCK AND I LET HER ESCAPE OUT OF MY HAND
SO THAT ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY CORNER OF THE PALACE THEY DID NOTHING BUT TATTLE AND WHISPER MURMUR AND GRUMBLE AT THE POOR LAD SAYING WHAT SORCERY HAS THIS FELLOW PRACTISED ON THE KING THAT HE TAKES SUCH A FANCY TO HIM
HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO CRY AND LAMENT FOR COMPANY'S SAKE AND AFTER HE HAD WEPT FOR SOME TIME THE MOON HAVING NOW WITH THE AXE OF HER RAYS BROKEN THE BAR OF THE SKY THE THREE FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING THE OUTCRY SAID TO CIENZO
IT IS BETTER TO SCAMPER OFF AND USE YOUR OWN HEELS THAN TO BE TOUCHED BY ANOTHER'S BETTER TO THROW YOUR LEGS OVER YOUR BACK THAN TO CARRY YOUR HEAD BETWEEN TWO LEGS IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR KNAPSACK AND BE OFF NONE OF THE SAINTS CAN HELP YOU
WHO WAS ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT AT THE TAPESTRY WHICH WAS NOT ONLY OF SILK EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUT HAD BESIDES MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEVICES AND THOUGHTS WORKED ON IT AND AMONGST THE REST IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
FROM THAT WAS SEEN A LARGE BEAR HERE SPRANG FORTH A LION THERE CAME RUNNING A WOLF BUT THE YOUTH BY THE AID OF BRIDLE AND SPUR DISTANCED THE MOUNTAIN AND GALLOPING WITHOUT STOP TO THE CITY
THEN THE KING DEMANDED HOW IT WAS THAT HE BOASTED OF HAVING KILLED THE DRAGON SINCE THE HEADS WERE BROUGHT BY THE MAN WHO WAS SITTING CROWNED AT HIS SIDE AND CIENZO ANSWERED THAT FELLOW DESERVES A PASTEBOARD MITRE RATHER THAN A CROWN
THAT HE CUT OFF ALL SEVEN HEADS WHICH FLEW FROM THE NECKS LIKE PEAS FROM THE PAN WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT THE TONGUES AND PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET HE FLUNG THE HEADS A MILE APART FROM THE BODY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER COME TOGETHER AGAIN
WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
AND YOU SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REGRET HAVING DONE ME THIS SERVICE CORVETTO KNEW WELL THAT THIS DRUM WAS SOUNDED BY THOSE WHO WISHED HIM ILL NEVERTHELESS TO OBEY THE KING HE SET OUT AND TOOK THE ROAD TO THE MOUNTAIN
AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD LOST THE CHILDREN AND WHEN HE HAD RELATED THE STORY HOW HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE THEM TO THE WOOD THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A GOOD SCOLDING CALLING HIM A BLOCKHEAD FOR ALLOWING A WOMAN TO PUT HER HEEL UPON HIS NECK
NENNILLO AT FIRST PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE VOICE BUT THE PRINCE WHO WAS STANDING ON ANOTHER BALCONY AND HAD ALSO HEARD IT TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SOUND CAME AND SAW THE FISH AND WHEN HE AGAIN HEARD THE SAME WORDS
NENNELLA STEPPED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE A NYMPH IN SOME INTERLUDE COME FORTH FROM THAT ANIMAL AT THE INCANTATION OF A MAGICIAN AND WHEN THE PRINCE ASKED HER HOW IT HAD ALL HAPPENED SHE TOLD HIM A PART OF HER SAD STORY
BUT CORVETTO WHO WAS ENCHANTED AND PERCEIVED THE TRAPS AND DISCOVERED THE TRICKS WAS AWARE OF ALL THE INTRIGUES AND THE AMBUSCADES THE PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES OF HIS ENEMIES HE KEPT HIS EARS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND HIS EYES OPEN
HE ONLY BRINGS INTO HIS HOUSE THE CAUSE OF THEIR RUIN THERE NEVER YET WAS A STEPMOTHER WHO LOOKED KINDLY ON THE CHILDREN OF ANOTHER OR IF BY CHANCE SUCH A ONE WERE EVER FOUND SHE WOULD BE REGARDED AS A MIRACLE AND BE CALLED A WHITE CROW
I KISS THY DELICATE LITTLE HANDS FROM THE INN OF THE FLOWER POT SUNDAY HAVING WRITTEN THIS LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH A WAFER HE PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE ENCHANTED DOG SAYING
THEN MENECHELLA ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND MAKING A CURTSEY TO THE KING SHE GAVE HIM THE LETTER TO READ AND WHEN THE KING HAD READ IT HE ORDERED THAT THE DOG SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO SEE WHERE HE WENT AND THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
AND GOING DOWN HE SAW A LIGHTED LAMP AND THREE GHOST LOOKING FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING A PITEOUS CLAMOUR CRYING ALAS MY BEAUTEOUS TREASURE I MUST LOSE THEE WHEN CIENZO SAW THIS
HE DUG A DEEP HOLE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE AND COVERING IT OVER WITH BUSHES AND EARTH HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND THE GATE AS SOON AS CORVETTO SAW THE OGRE COMING WITH HIS KINSFOLK HE SET UP A LOUD CRY IN THE COURTYARD STOP STOP
UPON THE SEA SHOULD SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT OF THEM FOR HAVING EMBARKED IN A SMALL BOAT NO SOONER WAS HE UPON THE OPEN SEA THAN THERE CAME SUCH A STORM OF WIND AND TUMULT OF THE WAVES THAT THE BOAT WAS UPSET AND ALL WERE DROWNED ALL EXCEPT NENNELLA
WHERE CORVETTO SPEEDILY STONED THEM TO DEATH THEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AND TOOK THE KEYS TO THE KING WHO SEEING THE VALOUR AND CLEVERNESS OF THE LAD IN SPITE OF ILL FORTUNE AND THE ENVY AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COURTIERS GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER TO WIFE
THEN CHOOSING A VERY RICH LORD AMONG HIS VASSALS HE GAVE HIM NENNELLA TO WIFE AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER GREAT LORD TO NENNILLO ALLOWING THEM ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON WITH THEIR FATHER SO THAT THEY WANTED FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD
SHOULD COME TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND HE WOULD THERE RECEIVE JOYFUL NEWS OF THEM JANNUCCIO WHO HAD ALL THIS TIME PASSED A SAD AND DISCONSOLATE LIFE BELIEVING THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES
BREAK AND GLUE TOGETHER OF WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU ONE INSTANCE IN THE STORY THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF WIDE RIVER AN EXCELLENT YOUTH NAMED CORVETTO WHO FOR HIS GOOD CONDUCT
THERE WAS ONCE A GOOD MAN NAMED JANNUCCIO WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA WHOM HE LOVED AS MUCH AS HIS OWN LIFE BUT DEATH HAVING WITH THE SMOOTH FILE OF TIME
BUT IF ANY ONE WERE TO ASK ME WHERE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY MIGHT TRULY BE FOUND I SHOULD KNOW OF NO OTHER PLACE TO NAME THAN THE COURT WHERE DETRACTION ALWAYS WEARS THE MASK OF AMUSEMENT WHERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CUT AND SEW UP WOUND AND HEAL
IT WAS HE WHO BEGAN AND PROVOKED ME WE ARE BUT BOYS AND THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUARREL AFTER ALL TIS A FIRST FAULT AND THE KING IS A MAN OF REASON BUT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT GREAT HARM CAN HE DO ME THE WIDE WORLD IS ONE'S HOME
SO IT SHALL BE DONE SAID THE PRINCE THE GOAT HAS BUTTED AT HERSELF QUICK NOW YOU HAVE PASSED THE SENTENCE AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT FOR HAVING BORNE THESE BEAUTIFUL STEPCHILDREN SUCH MALICE SO HE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE INSTANTLY EXECUTED
WHO HAVING HAD NO SHARE IN THE CORSAIR'S ROBBERIES LIKE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ESCAPED THE DANGER FOR JUST THEN A LARGE ENCHANTED FISH WHICH WAS SWIMMING ABOUT THE BOAT OPENED ITS HUGE THROAT AND SWALLOWED HER DOWN
I'VE CAUGHT HIM AND
PROMISING TO SCORE IT UP WITH THE CHALK OF GRATITUDE AT THE TAVERN OF MEMORY SO CORVETTO INSTANTLY SET OUT HEELS OVER HEAD AND ARRIVING AT THE OGRE'S PALACE HE FOUND THAT THE OGRESS WHILST HER HUSBAND WAS GONE TO INVITE THE KINSFOLK
ASKED HER WHAT THAT PERSON WOULD DESERVE WHO SHOULD DO THEM ANY HARM AND EVEN ENDANGER THEIR LIVES AND SHE REPLIED FOR MY PART I WOULD PUT HER INTO A CLOSED CASK AND SEND HER ROLLING DOWN A MOUNTAIN
BUT IF FOUR LOGS ARE NOT ENOW LET ME SPLIT FIVE AND TAKING UP A NEWLY GROUND AXE INSTEAD OF STRIKING THE WOOD HE STRUCK THE OGRESS ON THE NECK AND MADE HER FALL TO THE GROUND LIKE A PEAR THEN RUNNING QUICKLY TO THE GATE
AND LET HIM WHO IS AFRAID TURN CONSTABLE BUT ANTONIELLO WOULD NOT LISTEN TO REASON HE MADE SURE THE KING WOULD KILL CIENZO FOR HIS FAULT AND SAID DON'T STAND HERE AT RISK OF YOUR LIFE BUT MARCH OFF THIS VERY INSTANT
THEREUPON THE OGRE SUDDENLY STARTING UP TOLD HIS WIFE NOT TO PULL SO FOR SHE WAS DRAGGING ALL THE CLOTHES OFF HIM AND WOULD GIVE HIM HIS DEATH OF COLD
AND NOW THE LOT HAS FALLEN ON MENECHELLA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING SO THERE IS GREAT WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE ROYAL PALACE SINCE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN ALL THE LAND IS DOOMED TO BE DEVOURED BY THIS HORRID BEAST
WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED EVEN A HERO SO THEY WENT SLOWLY ALONG THE PATH OF ASHES AND IT WAS ALREADY MIDNIGHT ERE THEY REACHED THEIR HOME WHEN PASCOZZA THEIR STEPMOTHER SAW THE CHILDREN SHE ACTED NOT LIKE A WOMAN BUT A PERFECT FURY
WHOM THE FATHER EMBRACED AND KISSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT BEING SATISFIED THEN THE PRINCE MADE HIM PULL OFF HIS JACKET AND HAD HIM DRESSED LIKE A LORD AND SENDING FOR JANNUCCIO'S WIFE HE SHOWED HER THOSE TWO GOLDEN PIPPINS
WHEN SUDDENLY SHE FOUND A THING TO AMAZE HER INSIDE THE FISH BEAUTIFUL FIELDS AND FINE GARDENS AND A SPLENDID MANSION WITH ALL THAT HEART COULD DESIRE IN WHICH SHE LIVED LIKE A PRINCESS THEN SHE WAS CARRIED QUICKLY BY THE FISH TO A ROCK
HE WENT HIS WAY UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN HE CAME TO A WOOD THAT KEPT THE MULE OF THE SUN OUTSIDE ITS LIMITS WHILE IT WAS AMUSING ITSELF WITH SILENCE AND THE SHADES AN OLD HOUSE STOOD THERE AT THE FOOT OF A TOWER
THEN GOING VERY QUIETLY TO THE OGRE'S STABLE HE SADDLED AND MOUNTED THE HORSE AND FIXING HIS FEET FIRMLY IN THE STIRRUP TOOK HIS WAY BACK BUT AS SOON AS THE HORSE SAW HIMSELF SPURRED OUT OF THE PALACE HE CRIED ALOUD HOLLO
THERE DWELT AN OGRE THE MOST INHUMAN AND SAVAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN IN OGRELAND WHO BEING PERSECUTED BY THE KING HAD FORTIFIED HIMSELF IN A LONESOME WOOD ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHERE NO BIRD EVER FLEW AND WAS SO THICK AND TANGLED
WHEN THE OGRE HEARD THIS CHALLENGE HE RAN LIKE MAD AT CORVETTO TO MAKE A HASH OF HIM BUT RUSHING FURIOUSLY TOWARDS THE GATE DOWN HE TUMBLED WITH ALL HIS COMPANIONS HEAD OVER HEELS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
AND THEIR CAPTAIN TOOK HER HOME WITH HIM WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVING JUST LOST A LITTLE GIRL TOOK HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER MEANTIME NENNILLO WHO HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE DOGS
ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE ILL IN BED AND NOW YOU ARE SLAVING THUS AND HAVE NO PITY ON YOUR OWN FLESH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO REPLIED THE OGRESS I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME I AM HERE
MANY A MAN CURSES THE RAIN THAT FALLS UPON HIS HEAD AND KNOWS NOT THAT IT BRINGS ABUNDANCE TO DRIVE AWAY HUNGER AS IS SEEN IN THE PERSON OF A YOUNG MAN OF WHOM I WILL TELL YOU IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS ONCE A VERY RICH MERCHANT NAMED ANTONIELLO
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
ANOTHER TIME I WILL ACCEPT THE FAVOUR BUT NOW I AM IN HASTE ON BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE SO SAYING HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
AND JUMPING UP EXCLAIMED HOLLO THERE YOU ARE GETTING TOO TROUBLESOME BUT LEAVE OFF THIS SPORT AND LET'S HAVE A BOUT OF IT IF YOU HAVE ANY PLUCK FOR YOU HAVE FOUND THE LAST TO YOUR SHOE AT THESE WORDS HE HEARD A SHOUT OF LAUGHTER AND THEN A HOLLOW VOICE SAYING
FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
BUT WHAT A PITY YOU HAVE NOT THE OGRE'S TAPESTRY WHICH IS A THING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WORDS CAN TELL AND WOULD SPREAD YOUR FAME FAR AND WIDE THERE IS NO ONE HOWEVER ABLE TO PROCURE THIS TREASURE BUT CORVETTO WHO IS JUST THE LAD TO DO SUCH A KIND OF SERVICE
AND TAKE THIS TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER GIVE IT TO NO ONE ELSE BUT PLACE IT IN THE HAND OF THAT SILVER FACED MAIDEN HERSELF AWAY RAN THE DOG TO THE PALACE AS IF HE WERE FLYING AND GOING UP THE STAIRS HE FOUND THE KING
THAT ONE COULD NEVER SEE THE SUN THERE THIS OGRE HAD A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT WERE FORMED WITH A PENCIL AND AMONGST OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS IT COULD SPEAK LIKE ANY MAN
BUT THE MASTER BEING IN FEAR OF ROBBERS WOULD NOT OPEN TO HIM SO THE POOR YOUTH WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN IN THE RUINED OLD HOUSE HE TURNED HIS HORSE OUT TO GRAZE IN A MEADOW AND THREW HIMSELF ON SOME STRAW HE FOUND WITH THE DOG BY HIS SIDE
AND YOU CAN COME AND SEEK WHAT YOU REQUIRE SO SAYING HE TURNED AWAY HIS FACE NOT TO LET HIMSELF BE SEEN TO WEEP AND DISHEARTEN THE POOR LITTLE CREATURES WHEN NENNILLO AND NENNELLA HAD EATEN ALL THAT WAS IN THE BASKET
BUT GETTING TIMELY NOTICE FROM THE CLERKS IN THE LAW COURTS WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS AND WHOM HE KEPT IN HIS PAY HE FLED WITH ALL HIS FAMILY IT WAS DECREED HOWEVER PERHAPS BY THE JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN THAT HE WHO HAD COMMITTED HIS CRIMES UPON THE SEA
HERE'S A MAN OFFERS TO GIVE ME THE HALF OF A TREASURE HE FINDS AND I CARE NO MORE FOR IT THAN A GERMAN FOR COLD WATER THE FAIRY WISHES TO ENTERTAIN ME IN HER PALACE AND I CARE AS LITTLE FOR IT AS AN ASS FOR MUSIC AND NOW THAT I AM CALLED TO THE CROWN
WHETHER ANY OF THEM HAD LOST A SISTER AND NENNILLO REPLIED THAT HE RECOLLECTED AS A DREAM HAVING HAD A SISTER WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND HIM IN THE WOOD BUT THAT HE HAD NEVER SINCE HEARD ANY TIDINGS OF HER
WHO WAS STILL PAYING COMPLIMENTS TO THE COUNTRY CLOWN WHEN THE MAN SAW THE DOG WITH THE LETTER IN HIS MOUTH HE ORDERED IT TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM BUT THE DOG WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO ANY ONE AND BOUNDING UP TO MENECHELLA HE PLACED IT IN HER HAND
PUTS A CARNIVAL MASK ON THE FACE OF THE SKY AND AS SOON AS THE OGRE AND HIS WIFE WERE GONE TO BED CORVETTO STRIPPED THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER VERY QUIETLY AND WISHING TO STEAL THE COUNTERPANE OF THE BED LIKEWISE HE BEGAN TO PULL IT GENTLY
THAT IT CAN HOLD AN ARMY AND YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ALL THE COURTYARDS PORTICOES COLONNADES BALCONIES AND SPIRAL CHIMNEYS WHICH THERE ARE BUILT WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ARCHITECTURE THAT ART PRIDES HERSELF UPON THEM NATURE IS ABASHED
THE POOR HUSBAND WHO HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR THIS WOMAN SAID TO HER SOFTLY WIFE DON'T BE ANGRY FOR SUGAR IS DEAR AND TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE THE COCK CROWS I WILL REMOVE THIS ANNOYANCE IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
AND WHEREAS AT FIRST THEY WERE PUFFED UP WITH A LITTLE PIPE THEY WERE NOW BURSTING WITH THE BLASTS OF A SMITH'S BELLOWS SEEING THAT THE CROWBARS WITH WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO LAY CORVETTO'S GOOD FORTUNE IN RUINS ONLY SERVED TO SMOOTH THE ROAD TO HIS PROSPERITY
AND SUDDENLY THE HEAD JOINED ITSELF ON AGAIN LIKE A LIZARD JOINING ITSELF TO ITS TAIL CIENZO SEEING THIS EXCLAIMED HE WHO DARES NOT WINS NOT AND SETTING HIS TEETH HE STRUCK SUCH A FURIOUS BLOW
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED A GREAT TREASURE HE WISHED TO GIVE PART OF IT TO CIENZO BUT THE LATTER REFUSED AND TAKING HIS DOG AND MOUNTING ONCE MORE ON HIS HORSE SET OUT AGAIN ON HIS TRAVELS
THEN JANNUCCIO SAID MY LITTLE CHILDREN STAY HERE IN THIS WOOD AND EAT AND DRINK MERRILY BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING FOLLOW THIS LINE OF ASHES WHICH I HAVE BEEN STREWING AS WE CAME ALONG THIS WILL BE A CLUE TO LEAD YOU OUT OF THE LABYRINTH AND BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME
SO THAT NOBODY MAY HEAR A WORD NEW OR OLD OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE A BIRD IN THE BUSH IS BETTER THAN A BIRD IN THE CAGE HERE IS MONEY TAKE ONE OF THE TWO ENCHANTED HORSES I HAVE IN THE STABLE AND THE DOG WHICH IS ALSO ENCHANTED AND TARRY NO LONGER HERE
SO THE NEXT MORNING ERE THE DAWN HAD HUNG OUT THE RED COUNTERPANE AT THE WINDOW OF THE EAST TO AIR IT JANNUCCIO TOOK THE CHILDREN ONE BY EACH HAND AND WITH A GOOD BASKETFUL OF THINGS TO EAT UPON HIS ARM HE LED THEM TO A WOOD
THAT WHOSOEVER HAD KILLED THE DRAGON SHOULD COME AND MARRY THE PRINCESS NOW A RASCAL OF A COUNTRY FELLOW HEARING THIS PROCLAMATION TOOK THE HEADS OF THE DRAGON AND SAID MENECHELLA HAS BEEN SAVED BY ME THESE HANDS HAVE FREED THE LAND FROM DESTRUCTION
WHICH MADE SUCH A FURIOUS BARKING THAT THE PRINCE SENT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE PRETTY LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT TELL WHO WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE ORDERED ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN TO SET HIM UPON HIS SADDLE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ROYAL PALACE
WHERE GIVING THE CHILDREN ANOTHER BASKETFUL OF FOOD HE SAID TO THEM YOU SEE MY DEARS HOW THIS WIFE OF MINE WHO IS COME TO MY HOUSE TO BE YOUR RUIN AND A NAIL IN MY HEART HATES YOU THEREFORE REMAIN IN THIS WOOD WHERE THE TREES MORE COMPASSIONATE
BUT I MUST FIND SOME MEANS OF GETTING RID OF THESE CREATURES OR IT WILL COST ME MY LIFE BETTER TO BLUSH ONCE THAN TO GROW PALE A HUNDRED TIMES SO I'VE DONE WITH THEM FOR I AM RESOLVED TO SEND THEM AWAY OR TO LEAVE THE HOUSE MYSELF FOR EVER
THERE WAS A COCK IN THE ACT OF CROWING AT DAYBREAK AND OUT OF ITS MOUTH WAS SEEN COMING A MOTTO IN TUSCAN IF I ONLY SEE YOU AND IN ANOTHER PART A DROOPING HELIOTROPE WITH A TUSCAN MOTTO AT SUNSET
TAKE THIS TREASURE WHICH IS DESTINED FOR THEE ALONE BUT MIND AND TAKE CARE OF IT THEN THEY VANISHED AND CIENZO
TO KEEP THEM HERE TO PLAGUE MY VERY LIFE OUT GO TAKE THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT I'LL NOT WAIT FOR THE CROWING OF COCKS AND THE CACKLING OF HENS OR ELSE BE ASSURED THAT TO MORROW MORNING I'LL GO OFF TO MY PARENTS HOUSE FOR YOU DO NOT DESERVE ME
TILL THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY WITH THE NOISE BUT CORVETTO AFTER THROWING THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE WINDOW LET HIMSELF DROP DOWN UPON THEM THEN MAKING UP A GOOD BUNDLE HE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO THE CITY
AND THE HATRED OF THEIR STEPMOTHER BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOLLECT THE NAME OF THEIR FATHER NOR OF THEIR HOME THE PRINCE CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE ISSUED COMMANDING THAT WHOEVER HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN NAMED NENNILLO AND NENNELLA IN A WOOD
IN ORDER NOT TO TAKE A FALSE STEP WELL KNOWING THAT THE FORTUNE OF COURTIERS IS AS GLASS BUT THE HIGHER THE LAD CONTINUED TO RISE THE LOWER THE OTHERS FELL TILL AT LAST BEING PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS FEET
AND IN FOUR SECONDS WAS ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE OGRE LIVED THEN PASSING UNSEEN INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH HE SLEPT HE HID HIMSELF UNDER THE BED AND WAITED AS STILL AS A MOUSE UNTIL NIGHT TO MAKE THE STARS LAUGH
WHICH WAS A THING WORTHY OF A KING ADDED THAT HE OUGHT TO ENDEAVOUR BY ALL MEANS TO GET IT OUT OF THE OGRE'S CLAWS AND THAT CORVETTO WAS JUST THE LAD TO DO THIS AS HE WAS EXPERT AND CLEVER AT ESCAPING OUT OF THE FIRE
READY TO HELP YOU TOOTH AND NAIL WELCOME THEN SAID THE OGRESS AND AS YOU PROFFER ME SO MUCH KINDNESS JUST HELP ME TO SPLIT FOUR LOGS OF WOOD
BUT SCARCELY HAD HE CLOSED HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE BARKING OF THE DOG AND HEARD FOOTSTEPS STIRRING IN THE HOUSE CIENZO WHO WAS BOLD AND VENTURESOME SEIZED HIS SWORD AND BEGAN TO LAY ABOUT HIM IN THE DARK
BUT I KNEW HER THE MINUTE SHE TOOK MY CLOAK SAID HENRIETTE SHE'S DYED HER HAIR
PUSSY CAT SITS BY THE FIRE HOW SHOULD SHE BE FAIR
RAFFLES RANG HURRIEDLY FOR ME YES MADAM I SAID RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY TO HER CALL BUNNY SHE SAID HER HAND TREMBLING A LITTLE THE HOUR FOR ACTION HAS ARRIVED
I TOOK HIM TO HIS APARTMENT DISMISSED THE CAB AND LETTING OURSELVES INTO HIS ROOM WITH HIS OWN LATCH KEY PUT HIM TO BED HIS CLOTHES I TOOK AS A WELL ORDERED VALET SHOULD FROM HIS BED CHAMBER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE AFTER REMOVING THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS
AND IN ORDER TO QUIET ALL SUSPICION OF MY REAL STATUS IN THE VAN RAFFLES HOUSEHOLD I WAS COMPELLED TO ACT THE PART IN A FASHION WHICH REVOLTED ME OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS PLEASANT AND
LIMITLESS OUT OF THE DUSK OUT OF THE CEDARS AND PINES SING ON DEAREST BROTHER WARBLE YOUR REEDY SONG
OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSUS GASTER'S JEWELS
EVEN THEN WE'LL BE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE GOOD AND BY THE WAY BUNNY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON ONE THING AH WHAT'S THAT MY SANG FROID MY NERVE I ASKED AIRILY
CARRYING A CORPSE TO WHERE IT SHALL REST IN THE GRAVE NIGHT AND DAY JOURNEYS A COFFIN SIX COFFIN THAT PASSES THROUGH LANES AND STREETS THROUGH DAY AND NIGHT WITH THE GREAT CLOUD DARKENING THE LAND
WHEN I GOT THE CLOAK BACK BOTH WERE GONE OH SHE'S FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE ALL RIGHT AND WE MUST GET HER WHAT FOR TO ROB YOU
I DECIDED TO GO AFTER THE GENTLEMAN MYSELF WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO DIGBY ABOUT IT MUFFLING MYSELF UP SO THAT NO ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ME I HIRED A CAB AND DROVE OUT TO THE ROCKERBILT MANSION SENT IN WORD THAT MISTER DE PELT'S MAN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
LO BODY AND SOUL THIS LAND
I REALLY COULDN'T COULDN'T EAT MOUSE PIE AND I SHALL HAVE TO EAT IT BECAUSE IT IS A PARTY AND MY PIE WAS GOING TO BE VEAL AND HAM A PINK AND WHITE PIE DISH AND SO IS MINE JUST LIKE RIBBY'S DISHES THEY WERE BOTH BOUGHT AT TABITHA TWITCHIT'S
ONE OF HER FASCINATIONS REMAINED UNCHANGED
VICTORIOUS SONG DEATH'S OUTLET SONG YET VARYING EVER ALTERING SONG AS LOW AND WAILING YET CLEAR THE NOTES RISING AND FALLING FLOODING THE NIGHT SADLY SINKING AND FAINTING AS
THIS WON'T DO HENRIETTE NERVES WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN AND IF YOU CAN'T STAND YOUR LOSSES AT BRIDGE WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE FACE OF THE GREATER CRISIS WHICH IN OUR PROFESSION IS LIKELY TO CONFRONT US IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNEXPECTED VISIT OF POLICE AT ANY MOMENT HER ANSWER WAS A RINGING LAUGH
HUSH JUST WATCH ME SHE REPLIED WHEREUPON THIS WONDERFUL CREATURE TAKING MY WHITE GLOVES DELIBERATELY SMEARED THEIR PALMS AND INNER SIDES OF THE FINGERS
OVER THE DENSE PACK'D CITIES ALL AND THE TEEMING WHARVES AND WAYS I FLOAT THIS CAROL WITH JOY WITH JOY TO THEE O DEATH FIFTEEN TO THE TALLY OF MY SOUL LOUD AND STRONG KEPT UP THE GRAY BROWN BIRD
YES SAID I WHAT OF IT I WANT YOU DURING HER ABSENCE TO GO WITH ME TO HER ROOM THE SITUATION BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME YES I CRIED BREATHLESSLY AND SEARCH HER TRUNKS NO BUNNY NO THE EAVES WHISPERED HENRIETTE
WITH PURE DELIBERATE NOTES SPREADING FILLING THE NIGHT LOUD IN THE PINES AND CEDARS DIM
WITH RANGING HILLS ON THE BANKS WITH MANY A LINE AGAINST THE SKY AND SHADOWS AND THE CITY AT HAND WITH DWELLINGS SO DENSE AND STACKS OF CHIMNEYS AND ALL THE SCENES OF LIFE AND THE WORKSHOPS AND THE WORKMEN HOMEWARD RETURNING TWELVE
I BREAK THE SPRIGS FROM THE BUSHES
WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE PEEPED INTO THE BOTTOM OVEN THE PIE LOOKED VERY COMFORTABLE RIBBY PUT ON HER SHAWL AND BONNET AND WENT OUT AGAIN WITH A BASKET TO THE VILLAGE SHOP TO BUY A PACKET OF TEA A POUND OF LUMP SUGAR AND A POT OF MARMALADE
AND JUST AT THE SAME TIME DUCHESS CAME OUT OF HER HOUSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE VILLAGE RIBBY MET DUCHESS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET ALSO CARRYING A BASKET COVERED WITH A CLOTH THEY ONLY BOWED TO ONE ANOTHER THEY DID NOT SPEAK BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY
AND WHAT SHALL THE PICTURES BE THAT I HANG ON THE WALLS TO ADORN THE BURIAL HOUSE OF HIM I LOVE PICTURES OF GROWING SPRING AND FARMS AND HOMES WITH THE FOURTH MONTH EVE AT SUNDOWN AND THE GRAY SMOKE LUCID AND BRIGHT
AND I IN THE MIDDLE AS WITH COMPANIONS AND AS HOLDING THE HANDS OF COMPANIONS I FLED FORTH TO THE HIDING RECEIVING NIGHT THAT TALKS NOT DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE WATER THE PATH BY THE SWAMP IN THE DIMNESS
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE WOULDN'T DO FOR ME
THEN OUR TURN WILL COME OH THAT WOMAN IF I HAD NOT ADORED HER BEFORE I BUT ENOUGH THIS IS NO PLACE FOR SENTIMENT
AS SOON AS DUCHESS HAD GOT ROUND THE CORNER OUT OF SIGHT SHE SIMPLY RAN STRAIGHT AWAY TO RIBBY'S HOUSE RIBBY WENT INTO THE SHOP AND BOUGHT WHAT
I THANK YOU KINDLY LITTLE DOG I FARE AS WELL AS YOU OLD RHYME ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PUSSY CAT CALLED RIBBY WHO INVITED A LITTLE DOG CALLED DUCHESS TO TEA COME IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR DUCHESS SAID RIBBY'S LETTER
SING OF THE LOVE WE BORE HIM BECAUSE YOU DWELLER IN CAMPS KNOW IT TRULY
AS I SAY THERE WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OF THIS LOOSE CHANGE AND I RECKON UP THE VALUE OF HIS STUDS GARTER RUBIES AND FINGER RINGS AT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE OR A TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PULL IN ALL EH
BETTER CALL IT THE INCIDENT I PUT IN
SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE TOP OVEN OUT CAME A RICH STEAMY FLAVOUR OF VEAL AND HAM AND THERE STOOD A FINE BROWN PIE
STANDS THE LILAC BUSH TALL GROWING WITH HEART SHAPED LEAVES OF RICH GREEN
AND THE FIELDS ALL BUSY WITH LABOR AND THE INFINITE SEPARATE HOUSES HOW THEY ALL WENT ON EACH WITH ITS MEALS AND MINUTIA OF DAILY USAGES AND THE STREETS HOW THEIR THROBBINGS THROBB'D AND THE CITIES PENT
SOONER OR LATER DELICATE DEATH PRAIS'D BE THE FATHOMLESS UNIVERSE FOR LIFE AND JOY AND FOR OBJECTS AND KNOWLEDGE CURIOUS AND FOR LOVE SWEET LOVE BUT PRAISE PRAISE PRAISE
WHERE ON THE DECK MY CAPTAIN LIES FALLEN COLD AND DEAD O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN RISE UP AND HEAR THE BELLS RISE UP FOR YOU THE FLAG IS FLUNG FOR YOU THE BUGLE TRILLS
SO NOW THAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU IN JUST WHAT SHAPE MY NERVE IS WHAT IS THE DEMAND YOU ARE GOING TO PUT UPON IT
CONCLUDED DROPT IN THE NIGHT AND WAS GONE NINE SING ON THERE IN THE SWAMP O SINGER BASHFUL AND TENDER I HEAR YOUR NOTES I HEAR YOUR CALL I HEAR I COME PRESENTLY I UNDERSTAND YOU
AS I STOOD ON THE RISING GROUND IN THE BREEZE IN THE COOL TRANSPARENT NIGHT AS I WATCH'D WHERE YOU PASS'D AND WAS LOST IN THE NETHERWARD BLACK OF THE NIGHT
BURNING EXPANDING THE AIR WITH THE FRESH SWEET HERBAGE UNDER FOOT AND THE PALE GREEN LEAVES OF THE TREES PROLIFIC IN THE DISTANCE THE FLOWING GLAZE
VERY PUNCTUALLY AT FOUR O'CLOCK DUCHESS STARTED TO GO TO THE PARTY
HOUSE AND PEEPED INTO THE YARD UPON THE ROOF OF THE PIG STYE SAT DOCTOR MAGGOTTY AND THREE JACKDAWS
AND THE SIGHTS OF THE OPEN LANDSCAPE AND THE HIGH SPREAD SHY ARE FITTING AND LIFE AND THE FIELDS AND THE HUGE AND THOUGHTFUL NIGHT THE NIGHT IN SILENCE UNDER MANY A STAR THE OCEAN SHORE AND THE HUSKY WHISPERING WAVE WHOSE VOICE I KNOW
REMEMBER BUNNY CALM DELIBERATION YOUR GLOVES NOW WERE HER LAST WORDS TO ME
NOW WHILE I SAT IN THE DAY AND LOOK'D FORTH IN THE CLOSE OF THE DAY WITH ITS LIGHT AND THE FIELDS OF SPRING AND THE FARMERS PREPARING THEIR CROPS IN THE LARGE UNCONSCIOUS SCENERY OF MY LAND WITH ITS LAKES AND FORESTS IN THE HEAVENLY AERIAL BEAUTY
OH YES YES FETCH DOCTOR MAGGOTTY MY DEAR RIBBY HE IS A PIE HIMSELF HE WILL CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND RIBBY SETTLED DUCHESS IN AN ARMCHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE AND WENT OUT AND HURRIED TO THE VILLAGE TO LOOK FOR THE DOCTOR SHE FOUND HIM AT THE SMITHY
WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D ONE WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOM'D AND THE GREAT STAR EARLY DROOP'D IN THE WESTERN SKY IN THE NIGHT I MOURN'D AND YET SHALL MOURN WITH EVER RETURNING SPRING EVER RETURNING SPRING
SHE POPPED HER PIE INTO THE OVEN THERE WERE TWO OVENS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SOME OTHER KNOBS AND HANDLES WERE ONLY ORNAMENTAL AND NOT INTENDED TO OPEN
NO DETECTIVES I HOPE I REPLIED PALING AT THE THOUGHT NO SIR SHE LAUGHED MISSUS GASTER'S MAID WE MUST GET HER BUNNY
ARE YOU READY FOR A COUP REQUIRING A LOT OF IT WELL I REPLIED PLUMING MYSELF A BIT
FROM VARIOUS TRADESMEN OF THE TOWN I RECEIVED PRESENTS OF NO LITTLE VALUE IN THE FORM SOMETIMES OF DIAMOND SCARF PINS GOLD LINK SLEEVE BUTTONS CASES OF FINE WINES FOR MY OWN USE AND IN ONE OR TWO INSTANCES CHECKS OF SUBSTANTIAL VALUE
AS I HELD AS IF BY THEIR HANDS MY COMRADES IN THE NIGHT AND THE VOICE OF MY SPIRIT TALLIED THE SONG OF THE BIRD COME LOVELY AND SOOTHING DEATH UNDULATE ROUND THE WORLD SERENELY ARRIVING ARRIVING IN THE DAY IN THE NIGHT TO ALL TO EACH
I THINK THOUGHT DUCHESS TO HERSELF I THINK IT WOULD BE WISER IF I HELPED MYSELF TO PIE
SONG OF THE BLEEDING THROAT DEATH'S OUTLET SONG OF LIFE FOR WELL DEAR BROTHER I KNOW
AND I'D RATHER WORK IN A FACTORY OR BECOME A SHOP GIRL IN A DEPARTMENT STORE
THE PEARL ROPE OF MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS BUNNY SAID HENRIETTA ONE MORNING
YES THERE WAS MY DEAR RIBBY I AM SURE I HAVE SWALLOWED IT LET ME PROP YOU UP WITH A PILLOW MY DEAR DUCHESS WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL IT OH I DO FEEL SO ILL ALL OVER ME MY DEAR RIBBY
AS I SAW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL AS YOU BENT TO ME NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
AND THE ARMIES THAT REMAIN'D SUFFER'D SIXTEEN PASSING THE VISIONS PASSING THE NIGHT PASSING UNLOOSING THE HOLD OF MY COMRADES HANDS PASSING THE SONG OF THE HERMIT BIRD AND THE TALLYING SONG OF MY SOUL
BUT I SAW THEY WERE NOT AS WAS THOUGHT THEY THEMSELVES WERE FULLY AT REST THEY SUFFER'D NOT
COMPOSED OF TALCUM POWDER AND LIQUID HONEY
SHE'LL SKIP NOW SAID I NOT SHE SAID HENRIETTE TO DISAPPEAR NOW WOULD BE A CONFESSION OF GUILT IF FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE IS THE WOMAN I TAKE HER FOR
DUCHESS WENT HOME AND BRUSHED HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK COAT AND THEN SHE PICKED A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HER GARDEN AS A PRESENT FOR RIBBY AND PASSED THE TIME UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR
I FOLLOWED OUT HENRIETTE'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AN HOUR LATER RETURNED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT FIAMETTA WAS INDEED SAFELY ON HER WAY GOOD SAID MISSUS RAFFLES AND NOW BUNNY FOR THE GASTER JEWELS MOUNTING THE STAIRS RAPIDLY TAKING CARE OF COURSE
WHY MY DEAR BUNNY I LOST THAT MONEY ON PURPOSE
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT DID NOT LOOK QUITE POLITE
AS THAT POWERFUL PSALM IN THE NIGHT I HEARD FROM RECESSES PASSING I LEAVE THEE LILAC WITH HEART SHAPED LEAVES I LEAVE THEE THERE IN THE DOOR YARD BLOOMING RETURNING WITH SPRING I CEASE FROM MY SONG FOR THEE
AND TAKE IT AWAY SHE PUT IT OUTSIDE THE BACK DOOR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN BY THE FIRE AND SHUT HER EYES
WEAPONS AND EACH WITH MUSING SOUL RETIRE TO CELEBRATE OUR DEAR COMMANDER'S DEATH NO MORE FOR HIM LIFE'S STORMY CONFLICTS NOR VICTORY NOR DEFEAT NO MORE TIME'S DARK EVENTS CHARGING LIKE CEASELESS CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY BUT SING POET IN OUR NAME
AGAIN I LAUGHED HE WON'T SAID I WITH A CONVICTION BORN OF EXPERIENCE
AND HOW SHALL I DECK MY SONG FOR THE LARGE SWEET SOUL THAT HAS GONE AND WHAT SHALL MY PERFUME BE FOR THE GRAVE OF HIM I LOVE
AND SHE GAVE HER LETTER TO THE POSTMAN BUT SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT RIBBY'S PIE
O LIQUID AND FREE AND TENDER O WILD AND LOOSE TO MY SOUL O WONDROUS SINGER YOU ONLY I HEAR YET THE STAR HOLDS ME BUT WILL SOON DEPART YET THE LILAC WITH MASTERING ODOR HOLDS ME FOURTEEN
RIBBY WENT ON TO TIMOTHY BAKER'S AND BOUGHT THE MUFFINS THEN SHE WENT HOME THERE SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF SCUFFLING NOISE IN THE BACK PASSAGE AS SHE WAS COMING IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BUT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER DE PELT REMEMBERS NOW THAT HE WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS LAST NIGHT AND EVEN IF HE DOES YOU KNOW THAT I WAS IN THIS HOUSE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I BUNNY
BUT I WITH MOURNFUL TREAD WALK THE DECK MY CAPTAIN LIES FALLEN COLD AND DEAD HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO DAY MAY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO DAY AND SOLDIERS LET US DRAPE OUR WAR WORN
THAT EVEN MISSUS GASTER IS DISTURBED OVER HER CONDITION
BUT THERE THERE BUNNY I'LL MANAGE THIS LITTLE THING MYSELF IT'S A TRIFLE TOO SUBTLE FOR A MAN'S INTELLECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MAN IS YOU
OH DEAR HOW VERY UNFORTUNATE CRIED HENRIETTE
BLOWN FROM THE EASTERN SEA AND BLOWN FROM THE WESTERN SEA TILL THERE ON THE PRAIRIES MEETING THESE AND WITH THESE AND THE BREATH OF MY CHANT I'LL PERFUME THE GRAVE OF HIM I LOVE ELEVEN O WHAT SHALL I HANG ON THE CHAMBER WALLS
A ROPE WALK WON'T BE IN IT WITH HER
THE SONG THE WONDROUS CHANT OF THE GRAY BROWN BIRD
MY CAPTAIN DOES NOT ANSWER HIS LIPS ARE PALE AND STILL MY FATHER DOES NOT FEEL MY ARM HE HAS NO PULSE NOR WILL THE SHIP IS ANCHOR'D SAFE AND SOUND ITS VOYAGE CLOSED AND DONE
JUST A SHADE LONGER I WILL POUR OUT THE TEA WHILE WE WAIT
THE VIOLET AND PURPLE MORN WITH JUST FELT BREEZES THE GENTLE SOFT BORN MEASURELESS LIGHT THE MIRACLE SPREADING BATHING ALL THE FULFILL'D NOON
A PIE DISH WITH A PINK RIM YOU NEVER TASTED ANYTHING SO GOOD AND YOU SHALL EAT IT ALL I WILL EAT MUFFINS MY DEAR DUCHESS WROTE RIBBY I WILL COME VERY PUNCTUALLY MY DEAR RIBBY WROTE DUCHESS AND THEN AT THE END SHE ADDED I HOPE IT ISN'T MOUSE
THAT EVEN IF SO LITTLE AS ONE OF THESE FASTENED ITS TALONS UPON THE PEARL ROPE OF MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS NOTHING UNDER HEAVEN COULD SAVE IT FROM LACERATION WHAT A MARVELLOUS MIND THERE LAY BEHIND THOSE EXQUISITE CHILDLIKE EYES OF THE WONDERFUL HENRIETTE
WHERE THEN I ASKED WITH MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES REPLIED HENRIETTE THE FACT IS SHE ADDED I HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED HER SHE HAS ACTED HER PART WELL
AND IT HAS AFFECTED HER USUAL CALMNESS I MUST DO SOMETHING TO WARN HER AGAINST THIS MOMENTARY WEAKNESS
THE VARIED AND AMPLE LAND THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH IN THE LIGHT OHIO'S SHORES AND FLASHING MISSOURI AND EVER THE FAR SPREADING PRAIRIES COVER'D WITH GRASS AND CORN LO THE MOST EXCELLENT SUN SO CALM AND HAUGHTY
AND I WITH MY COMRADES THERE IN THE NIGHT WHILE MY SIGHT THAT WAS BOUND IN MY EYES UNCLOSED AS TO LONG PANORAMAS OF VISIONS AND I SAW ASKANT THE ARMIES I SAW AS IN NOISELESS DREAMS HUNDREDS OF BATTLE FLAGS
I AM TRULY GLAD TO HEAR IT HE HAS BROUGHT YOU A PILL MY DEAR DUCHESS I THINK I SHOULD FEEL QUITE WELL IF HE ONLY FELT MY PULSE SAID DUCHESS BACKING AWAY FROM THE MAGPIE WHO SIDLED UP WITH SOMETHING IN HIS BEAK IT IS ONLY A BREAD PILL YOU HAD MUCH BETTER TAKE IT
SUPPOSE HE HAD RECOGNIZED YOU CRIED HENRIETTE OH HE DID OR AT LEAST HE THOUGHT HE DID I REPLIED SMILING BROADLY AT THE RECOLLECTION
AFTER THE PERTURB'D WINDS AND THE STORMS UNDER THE ARCHING HEAVENS OF THE AFTERNOON SWIFT PASSING AND THE VOICES OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN THE MANY MOVING SEA TIDES AND I SAW THE SHIPS HOW THEY SAIL'D AND THE SUMMER APPROACHING WITH RICHNESS
I HUNG THEM NEATLY OVER A CHAIR AND DEPARTED TAKING WITH ME OF COURSE EVERYTHING OF VALUE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAD ABOUT HIM EVEN DOWN TO THE TWO BRILLIANT RUBIES HE WORE IN HIS GARTER BUCKLES THIS CONSISTED OF TWO HANDFULS OF CRUMPLED TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS TROUSERS
RIBBY EXPLAINED THAT HER GUEST HAD SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN DOCTOR MAGGOTTY HOPPED SO FAST THAT RIBBY HAD TO RUN IT WAS MOST CONSPICUOUS ALL THE VILLAGE COULD SEE THAT RIBBY WAS FETCHING THE DOCTOR BUT WHILE RIBBY HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR THE DOCTOR A CURIOUS THING HAD HAPPENED TO DUCHESS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BY HERSELF
I WAS INSTALLED AT BOLIVAR LODGE AS HEAD BUTLER AND STEWARD MY SALARY TO CONSIST OF WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT OF IT ON THE SIDE
FROM MY GAZE ON THEE IN THE WEST FRONTING THE WEST COMMUNING WITH THEE
AND THEN BACK TO ENGLAND FOR FIAMETTA
EIGHT O WESTERN ORB SAILING THE HEAVEN
WHEN WORD CAME OVER THE TELEPHONE TO DIGBY MISTER DE PELT'S VALET THAT MISTER DE PELT WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS AND IN NO CONDITION TO GO HOME ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE MESSAGE AND OBSERVING THAT DIGBY WAS ENGAGED IN A GAME OF BILLIARDS AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
WITH ALL THE MOURNFUL VOICES OF THE DIRGES POUR'D AROUND THE COFFIN THE DIM LIT CHURCHES AND THE SHUDDERING ORGANS WHERE AMID THESE YOU JOURNEY
FOR FRESH AS THE MORNING THUS WOULD I CHANT A SONG FOR YOU O SANE AND SACRED DEATH ALL OVER BOUQUETS OF ROSES O DEATH I COVER YOU OVER WITH ROSES AND EARLY LILIES
AND THE SINGER SO SHY TO THE REST RECEIV'D ME THE GRAY BROWN BIRD I KNOW RECEIV'D US COMRADES THREE AND HE SANG THE CAROL OF DEATH AND A VERSE FOR HIM I LOVE FROM DEEP SECLUDED RECESSES FROM THE FRAGRANT CEDARS AND THE GHOSTLY PINES SO STILL CAME THE CAROL OF THE BIRD
IT IS A VERY ODD THING THAT RIBBY'S PIE WAS NOT IN THE OVEN WHEN I PUT MINE IN AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE I PUT MY PIE INTO A NICE HOT OVEN AT THE TOP I COULD NOT TURN ANY OF THE OTHER HANDLES
AND THEN I UNFOLDED TO HER THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN BY ASSUMING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE POSITION OF VALET
WITH WHOM I WAS PERFORCE REQUIRED TO ASSOCIATE THIS WENT VERY MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN AT FIRST FOR
THEN SHE WENT OUT WITH A CAN TO THE WELL FOR WATER TO FILL UP THE KETTLE THEN SHE BEGAN TO SET THE ROOM IN ORDER FOR IT WAS THE SITTING ROOM AS WELL AS THE KITCHEN WHEN RIBBY HAD LAID THE TABLE SHE WENT OUT DOWN THE FIELD TO THE FARM TO FETCH MILK AND BUTTER
PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WISE MY DEAR DUCHESS RIBBY AND DUCHESS SAID GOOD BYE AFFECTIONATELY AND DUCHESS STARTED HOME HALF WAY UP THE LANE SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK RIBBY HAD GONE IN AND SHUT HER DOOR
FOR YOU THEY CALL THE SWAYING MASS THEIR EAGER FACES TURNING HERE CAPTAIN DEAR FATHER THIS ARM BENEATH YOUR HEAD IT IS SOME DREAM THAT ON THE DECK
WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOD SHE DESCRIBES A COMPLETE CIRCLE WITH HER HEAD WHEN A COLD FORMAL HANDSHAKE IS NECESSARY SHE PERPETRATES AN EMBRACE AND THAT IS WHERE WE COME IN AT MY NEXT TUESDAY TEA SHE WILL BE PRESENT SHE WILL WEAR HER PEARLS SHE'LL BE STRUNG WITH THEM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE SIGHING AND GROANING AND FEELING VERY UNHAPPY HOW COULD I HAVE SWALLOWED IT SUCH A LARGE THING AS A PATTY PAN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND STARED MOURNFULLY AT THE GRATE
AND GIMCRACKS GENERALLY THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER AFTER HER CALLS UPON OR DINNERS WITH LADIES OF FASHION THAT SHE HAD THAT QUALITY OF TRUE GENIUS WHICH NEVER OVERLOOKS THE SMALLEST DETAILS THE FIRST BIG COUP AFTER MY ARRIVAL AS THE RESULT OF HER GENIUS
SHE DROPPED THE SUGAR IN CONFUSION AND HAD TO GO HUNTING UNDER THE TEA TABLE SO DID NOT SEE WHICH OVEN RIBBY OPENED IN ORDER TO GET OUT THE PIE RIBBY SET THE PIE UPON THE TABLE THERE WAS A VERY SAVOURY SMELL DUCHESS CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE CLOTH MUNCHING SUGAR AND SAT UP ON A CHAIR
THERE WAS ALSO WHAT WAS CALLED A STEWARD'S REBATE ON THE MONTHLY BILLS WHICH IN CIRCLES WHERE LAVISH ENTERTAINMENT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AMOUNTED TO A TIDY LITTLE INCOME IN ITSELF
IT DID NOT TAKE ME MANY DAYS TO DISCOVER THAT HENRIETTE WAS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO HER LATE HUSBAND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL PROFIT ESCAPED HER EYE AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE AS TIME WENT ON AND I NOTED THE ACCUMULATION OF SPOONS FORKS NUTCRACKERS
YOU KNOW MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS YES SAID I SHE IS THE LADY WHO ASKED ME FOR THE OLIVES AT YOUR LAST DINNER PRECISELY OBSERVED HENRIETTE YOU POSSIBLY OBSERVED ALSO THAT WHEREVER SHE GOES SHE WEARS ABOUT SIXTY NINE YARDS OF PEARL ROPE UPON HER PERSON
PATTY PANS AND THEY ARE ALL IN THE CUPBOARD DUCHESS SET UP A HOWL I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I HAVE SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN OH MY DEAR RIBBY I DO FEEL SO ILL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE MY DEAR DUCHESS THERE WAS NOT A PATTY PAN
TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND I AM TO LAND A YARD OR TWO OF THE STUFF FOR YOU IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY I DEMANDED HOW IS IT TO BE BY KIDNAPPING THE LADY THE SNATCH AND RUN GAME OR HOW SARCASM DOES NOT SUIT YOUR COMPLEXION BUNNY RETORTED HENRIETTE
PASSING THE YELLOW SPEAR'D WHEAT EVERY GRAIN FROM ITS SHROUD IN THE DARK BROWN FIELDS UPRISEN
APPEAR'D THE CLOUD APPEAR'D THE LONG BLACK TRAIL AND I KNEW DEATH ITS THOUGHT AND THE SACRED KNOWLEDGE OF DEATH THEN WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF DEATH AS WALKING ONE SIDE OF ME
YOUR BEST METHOD IS TO FOLLOW IMPLICITLY THE DIRECTIONS OF WISER BRAINS YOU ARE A FIRST CLASS TOOL BUT AS A PRINCIPAL WELL
BUT I THINK IT IS PRETTY GOOD I MANAGED TO RAISE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT BY THE USE OF IT LAST NIGHT INDEED SAID HENRIETTE WITH A SLIGHT FROWN HOW BUNNY YOU KNOW YOU ARE LIKELY TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FOR ALL OF US IF YOU WORK ON THE SIDE WHAT PRAY DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT
AS THE MAID OF MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES TO HER EAGLE EYE IT WAS ANOTHER PROMISING FIELD FOR PROFIT FOR HENRIETTE HAD SPARED NEITHER PAINS NOR MONEY TO IMPRESS FIAMETTA WITH THE IDEA THAT NEXT TO MISSUS GASTER SHE WAS ABOUT AS LAVISH AND FINANCIALLY CAPABLE A HOUSEHOLDER
LITTLE TIN PATTY PAN DUCHESS DREW A LONG BREATH THEN I MUST HAVE BEEN EATING MOUSE NO WONDER I FEEL ILL BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD FEEL WORSE IF I HAD REALLY SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN DUCHESS REFLECTED WHAT A VERY AWKWARD THING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO RIBBY

THINKING THAT HE HAD NOT USED ENOUGH ASHES THE OLD MAN TOOK HANDFULS AND AGAIN SPRINKLED THEM OVER THE WITHERED TREE BUT ALL TO NO EFFECT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES THE ASHES WERE BLOWN INTO THE DAIMIO'S EYES
SWAYING AND SWIRLING WITH EASY GRACEFUL GESTURES AND SINGING THE LAST OF ITS MOUNTAIN SONGS BEFORE IT REACHES THE DIZZY EDGE OF YOSEMITE
SO PUSHING SHIRO AWAY HE BEGAN TO DIG HIMSELF BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND AS HE WENT ON DIGGING A FOUL SMELL WAS NOTICEABLE AND HE AT LAST CAME UPON A REFUSE HEAP
THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED THAT HE HAD KILLED SHIRO BECAUSE OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AT THIS DREADFUL NEWS SHIRO'S MASTER WEPT MANY SAD AND BITTER TEARS GREAT INDEED WAS HIS WOFUL SURPRISE
FETCHED HIS SPADE AND BEGAN TO DIG THE GROUND AT THAT SPOT WHAT WAS HIS ASTONISHMENT WHEN AFTER DIGGING FOR SOME TIME HE CAME UPON A HEAP OF OLD AND VALUABLE COINS AND THE DEEPER HE DUG THE MORE GOLD COINS DID HE FIND
LOOMS TISSIACK OR HALF DOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST SUBLIME OF ALL THE WONDERFUL YOSEMITE ROCKS RISING IN SERENE MAJESTY FROM FLOWERY GROVES AND MEADOWS
NEVER FAIL TO CHARM ITS HEIGHT FROM ITS BASE TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF
AND HIS MASTER GAVE HIM THE FOOD NEXT DOOR TO THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE THERE LIVED ANOTHER OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE BOTH WICKED AND CRUEL AND WHO HATED THEIR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THE DOG SHIRO WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE WORLD TRACING THE RIVER BEYOND THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL WE ARE LEAD INTO THE LITTLE YOSEMITE A VALLEY LIKE THE GREAT YOSEMITE IN FORM SCULPTURE AND VEGETATION
IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN AND ALL THE TREES HAD SHED THEIR LEAVES BUT NO SOONER DID THE ASHES TOUCH THEIR BRANCHES THAN THE CHERRY TREES THE PLUM TREES AND ALL OTHER BLOSSOMING SHRUBS
AS IF AN INVISIBLE HAND WERE AT WORK WHEN THE OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE SAW THIS THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A REWARD TO THEM FROM SHIRO FOR THEIR FAITHFUL LOVE TO HIM THEY TASTED THE CAKES
AND THE OLD MAN CARRIED HOME A BASKET FULL OF ASHES NOT LONG AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN ACCIDENTALLY SCATTERED SOME OF THE ASHES MADE BY THE BURNING OF THE MORTAR ON THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED
THE UPPER CANYONS HERE THE VALLEY DIVIDES INTO THREE BRANCHES THE TENAYA NEVADA AND ILLILOUETTE CANYONS EXTENDING BACK INTO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE HIGH SIERRA
TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO AND LET ME SEE THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR WITH THE DAIMIO AND HIS COURT FOLLOWING THEN WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND APPROACHING A DEAD TREE TOOK OUT A HANDFUL OF THE ASHES WHICH HE CARRIED WITH HIM
AND SCATTERED THEM OVER THE TREE BUT NOT ONLY DID THE TREE NOT BURST INTO FLOWER
WITH THE SENTIMENTAL ONLOOKER FRESH FROM A VISIT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL JUST BEYOND THIS GLORIOUS FLOOD THE EL CAPITAN ROCK REGARDED BY MANY AS THE MOST SUBLIME FEATURE OF THE VALLEY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE BRIDAL VEIL THERE IS ANOTHER FINE FALL CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN THE VEIL WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST AND MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT MEASURED FROM THE BROW OF THE CLIFF
AND TAKING UP HIS POSITION HERE THE OLD MAN SAT DOWN AND SCATTERED THE ASHES RIGHT AND LEFT ALL OVER THE BRANCHES AND TWIGS WONDERFUL INDEED WAS THE RESULT
WE COME WITHIN A FEW MILES TO THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH
WE PASS BETWEEN THE NORTH DOME AND HALF DOME AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR COME TO MIRROR LAKE THE DOME CASCADE AND TENAYA FALL
INTO ANOTHER WORLD WHERE CLIMATE VEGETATION
IS SEEN THROUGH THE PINE GROVES STANDING FORWARD BEYOND THE GENERAL LINE OF THE WALL IN MOST IMPOSING GRANDEUR A TYPE OF PERMANENCE IT IS THIRTY THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH A PLAIN
EXCUSE ME HE TOOK THE POT OF ASHES WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND BEGAN TO CLIMB THE TREE EVERY ONE WATCHING HIS MOVEMENTS WITH GREAT INTEREST AT LAST HE CLIMBED TO THE SPOT WHERE THE TREE DIVIDED INTO TWO GREAT BRANCHES
AMONG THESE FLAT TOPPED PILLARS KISSING AND PLASHING NOTES AS WELL AS THUNDER LIKE DETONATIONS ARE PRODUCED LIKE THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE FALL THOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE THE RAINBOWS OF THE VEIL
ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
AND FOUND THEM NICER THAN ANY OTHER FOOD SO FROM THIS TIME THEY NEVER TROUBLED ABOUT FOOD FOR THEY LIVED UPON THE CAKES WITH WHICH THE MORTAR NEVER CEASED TO SUPPLY THEM THE GREEDY NEIGHBOR HEARING OF THIS NEW PIECE OF GOOD LUCK
A BUILDING OF ONE STONE SEWN FROM THE LIVING ROCK WITH SIDES ROOF GABLE SPIRE AND ORNAMENTAL PINNACLES FASHIONED AND FINISHED SYMMETRICALLY LIKE A WORK OF ART AND SET ON A WELL GRADED PLATEAU
THEY HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS A WONDERFUL OLD MAN WHO COULD MAKE WITHERED TREES TO BLOSSOM AND THAT HIS LORD HAD SENT HIM TO ASK THE OLD MAN TO COME TO HIM AND ADDED THE KNIGHT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL COME AT ONCE
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET HIGH AS IF NATURE IN MAKING SO FINE A BUILDING HAD ALSO BEEN CAREFUL THAT IT SHOULD BE FINELY SEEN FROM EVERY DIRECTION ITS PECULIAR FORM AND GRACEFUL MAJESTIC BEAUTY OF EXPRESSION
BUT THAT HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING AND TORMENTING HIM WHENEVER THE DOG CROSSED HIS PATH BUT THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS TOO KIND HEARTED TO REFUSE HIS NEIGHBOR SO HE CONSENTED TO LEND THE DOG
THAT ONE OF THE FAVORITE CHERRY TREES IN THIS NOBLEMAN'S GARDEN HAD WITHERED
DAY AFTER DAY WENT BY AND THE GOOD OLD MAN WAITED IN VAIN THEN HE WENT TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS DOG WITHOUT ANY SHAME OR HESITATION
ARE YOU THE OLD MAN WHO CAN MAKE WITHERED TREES FLOWER EVEN OUT OF SEASON THE OLD MAN MADE AN OBEISANCE AND REPLIED I AM THAT OLD MAN THEN THE DAIMIO SAID
THE STREAM IS NEARLY FORTY FEET WIDE AND WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING RAPIDLY IN THE SPRING IT IS ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP WITH A CURRENT OF TWO AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR THIS IS ABOUT THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FORMS THE FALL IN MAY AND JUNE
SEVERELY SIMPLE GLACIER SCULPTURED FACE OF GRANITE THE END OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPACT AND ENDURING OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES UNRIVALED IN HEIGHT AND BREADTH AND FLAWLESS STRENGTH
I BROKE IT TO PIECES AND NOW I AM MAKING A FIRE OF THE WOOD FOR WHEN I TRIED TO POUND CAKES IN IT ONLY SOME HORRID SMELLING STUFF CAME OUT THE GOOD OLD MAN SAID I AM VERY SORRY FOR THAT
WITH THE FINELY MODELED NORTH DOME THE ROYAL ARCHES AND WASHINGTON COLUMN ON OUR LEFT GLACIER POINT WITH ITS MASSIVE MAGNIFICENT SCULPTURE ON THE RIGHT AND IN THE MIDDLE DIRECTLY IN FRONT
ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE BRIDAL VEIL CREEK THE BASIN OF WHICH IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS MEADOWS AND ITS SUPERB FORESTS OF SILVER FIR ON THE NORTH SIDE
AND TO THE BIG TUOLUMNE CANYON WITH ITS GLORIOUS ABUNDANCE OF ROCK AND FALLING GLIDING TOSSING WATER FOR ALL THESE THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FORM A DELIGHTFUL CENTER
BUT THE SUFFOCATING BLASTS OF SPRAY THAT FILL THE RECESS IN THE WALL WHICH IT OCCUPIES PREVENT A NEAR APPROACH IN AUTUMN HOWEVER WHEN ITS FEEBLE CURRENT FALLS IN A SHOWER IT MAY THEN PASS FOR TEARS
IN TRANQUIL RICHLY EMBOWERED REACHES BEYOND THIS LITTLE YOSEMITE IN THE MAIN CANYON THERE ARE THREE OTHER LITTLE YOSEMITES THE HIGHEST SITUATED A FEW MILES BELOW THE BASE OF MOUNT LYELL
THE TOTAL DESCENT MADE BY THE STREAM FROM ITS HIGHEST SOURCES
IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR ATTRACTED BY SHIRO'S BARKING HAD BEEN AN UNSEEN AND ENVIOUS WITNESS OF THE FINDING OF THE TREASURE HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE TOO WOULD LIKE TO FIND A FORTUNE
SO HE SET TO WORK AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE ASHES WHICH REMAINED IN THE FIRE PLACE FROM THE BURNING OF THE WONDERFUL MORTAR THEN HE SET OUT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME GREAT MAN TO EMPLOY HIM
IT IS ABOUT THREE MILES LONG WITH WALLS FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH CASCADES COMING OVER THEM
MAKING A GRAND TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN LAKES WHOSE WATERS COME TO SING AT YOSEMITE SO GLORIOUS IS THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREAT VALLEY SO HARMONIOUS ITS RELATIONS TO ITS WIDESPREADING FOUNTAINS
ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKEN GREAT CARE OF THE WICKED OLD MAN RETURNED TO HIS HOME WITH AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS FACE AND TOLD HIS WIFE HOW HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN HIS CRAFTY INTENTIONS HE THEN TOOK HIS SPADE
YOU MUST MAKE THAT DEAD CHERRY TREE IN MY GARDEN BLOSSOM AGAIN BY MEANS OF YOUR FAMOUS ASHES I SHALL LOOK ON THEN THEY ALL WENT INTO THE GARDEN THE DAIMIO AND HIS RETAINERS AND THE LADIES IN WAITING WHO CARRIED THE DAIMIO'S SWORD
BURST INTO BLOOM SO THAT THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN WAS SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF SPRING THE OLD MAN'S DELIGHT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND HE CAREFULLY PRESERVED THE REMAINING ASHES
FINE THRIFTY FORESTS ARE GROWING LAKES AND MEADOWS AND SMALL SPONGY BOGS MAY BE FOUND HIDING HERE AND THERE IN THE WOODS OR BACK IN THE FOUNTAIN RECESSES OF MOUNT HOFFMAN WHILE A THOUSAND GARDENS ARE PLANTED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE STREAMS
MAKING A VERTICAL DESCENT IN ALL OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET JUST BEYOND THE DOME CASCADES ON THE SHOULDER OF MOUNT WATKINS THERE IS AN OLD TRAIL ONCE USED BY INDIANS ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RANGE TO MONO BUT IN THE CANYON ABOVE THIS POINT
BUT SHIRO WENT ON BARKING AND DIGGING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE HIDDEN BENEATH THE TREE AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED IT AT LAST STRUCK THE OLD MAN HE RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
NOW DIVING UNDER WILLOWS AND LAVING THEIR RED ROOTS OOZING THROUGH GREEN PLUSHY BOGS PLASHING OVER SMALL FALLS AND DANCING DOWN SLANTING CASCADES CALMING AGAIN GLIDING THROUGH PATCHES OF SMOOTH GLACIER MEADOWS
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE SENTINEL ARE THE THREE BROTHERS AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS WITH THREE GABLES FRONTING THE VALLEY ONE ABOVE ANOTHER THE TOPMOST GABLE NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND FEET HIGH
LONG LONG AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO SUPPORTED THEMSELVES BY CULTIVATING A SMALL PLOT OF LAND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY AND PEACEFUL ONE SAVE FOR ONE GREAT SORROW AND THIS WAS THEY HAD NO CHILD
PASSING THE CATHEDRAL WE DESCEND INTO THE DELIGHTFUL SPACIOUS TUOLUMNE VALLEY FROM WHICH EXCURSIONS MAY BE MADE TO MOUNTS DANA LYELL RITTER CONNESS AND MONO LAKE
USUALLY WELL FRINGED WITH SHRUBS AND TREES AND PRESENTING THE POLISHED SURFACES GIVEN THEM BY THE GLACIER THAT BROUGHT THEM INTO RELIEF ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN BROAD MORAINE BEDS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED AND ON THESE
WHILE ITS BROAD OPEN BASIN BETWEEN ITS FOUNTAIN MOUNTAINS AND CANYON IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS LAKES AND FORESTS AND MAGNIFICENT MORAINES RETURNING TO THE VALLEY AND GOING UP THE NORTH BRANCH OF TENAYA CANYON
AND NOW JUST AS HE SEEMED ON THE POINT OF FINDING WHAT HE SOUGHT ONLY A HORRID SMELLING REFUSE HEAP HAD REWARDED HIM FOR A MORNING'S DIGGING INSTEAD OF BLAMING HIS OWN GREED FOR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HE BLAMED THE POOR DOG
THE BRIDAL VEIL SHOOTS FREE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CLIFF BY THE VELOCITY THE STREAM HAS ACQUIRED IN DESCENDING A LONG SLOPE ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE FALL LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AVALANCHE TALUS ON THE WEST SIDE
AND ALSO FOR A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF GRASS AND MAIDEN HAIR ON THE SIDE OF THE TALUS WHICH LOWER DOWN IS PLANTED WITH OAK LAUREL AND WILLOWS GENERAL FEATURES OF THE VALLEY
NATURAL FEATURES NEAR THE VALLEY RETURNING NOW TO YOSEMITE AND ASCENDING THE MIDDLE OR NEVADA BRANCH OF THE VALLEY
WOULD TAKE US FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF A SINGLE BOOK NOR CAN WE HERE CONSIDER THE FORMATION OF THESE MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPES HOW THE CRYSTAL ROCK WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY GLACIERS MADE UP OF CRYSTAL SNOW MAKING BEAUTY
THE THUNDER OF THE YOSEMITE FALL IS HEARD AND WHEN WE ARRIVE IN FRONT OF THE SENTINEL ROCK IT IS REVEALED IN ALL ITS GLORY FROM BASE TO SUMMIT HALF A MILE IN HEIGHT
TO ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH IT BEYOND THE CASCADES NO GREAT DIFFICULTY WILL BE ENCOUNTERED A SUCCESSION OF CHARMING LILY GARDENS AND MEADOWS OCCURS IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS AMONG THE ROCK WAVES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANYON
AND OF ALL THAT HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY BEFALLEN HIM AND HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS ALL THE ENVY AND JEALOUSY THAT FILLED HIS HEART HE CALLED TO MIND HOW HE HAD FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO FIND THE GOLD COINS AND THEN IN MAKING THE MAGIC CAKES
AND HASTENED TO HIS OWN FIELD FORCING THE UNWILLING SHIRO TO FOLLOW HIM AS SOON AS HE REACHED A YENOKI TREE HE SAID TO THE DOG THREATENINGLY
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA TO DESCRIBE THESE WITH ALL THEIR WEALTH OF YOSEMITE FURNITURE AND THE WILDERNESS OF LOFTY PEAKS ABOVE THEM THE HOME OF THE AVALANCHE AND TREASURY OF THE FOUNTAIN SNOW
NONE TOOK EFFECT THE KNIGHT WAS SORE PERPLEXED WHEN HE SAW WHAT GREAT DISPLEASURE THE LOSS OF HIS FAVORITE CHERRY TREE CAUSED THE DAIMIO AT THIS POINT FORTUNATELY
THIS MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO ARREST THE FALSE HANA SAKA JIJII AT ONCE AND PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR AN IMPOSTOR FROM THIS IMPRISONMENT THE WICKED OLD MAN WAS NEVER FREED
ON THE SOUTH THE VAST GRANITE WAVE OF CLOUDS REST A MILE IN HEIGHT AND BETWEEN THEM THE FINE TENAYA CASCADE WITH SILVERY PLUMES OUTSPREAD ON SMOOTH GLACIER POLISHED FOLDS OF GRANITE
THEY DENIED THEMSELVES TO GIVE IT TO SHIRO NOW SHIRO MEANS WHITE AND HE WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE OF HIS COLOR HE WAS A REAL JAPANESE DOG AND VERY LIKE A SMALL WOLF IN APPEARANCE
DRAGGED HIM UNDER A LARGE YENOKI TREE HERE HE BEGAN TO DIG VERY INDUSTRIOUSLY WITH HIS PAWS YELPING WITH JOY ALL THE TIME THE OLD MAN UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ALL MEANT STOOD LOOKING ON IN BEWILDERMENT
ON THE GROUND LAY WHAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE PIECES OF A BROKEN MORTAR IN ANSWER TO THE OLD MAN'S INQUIRY THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED HAUGHTILY HAVE YOU COME TO ASK ME FOR YOUR MORTAR
WAS FILLED WITH ENVY AS BEFORE AND CALLED ON THE OLD MAN AND ASKED LEAVE TO BORROW THE WONDERFUL MORTAR FOR A SHORT TIME PRETENDING THAT HE TOO SORROWED FOR THE DEATH OF SHIRO AND WISHED TO MAKE CAKES FOR A FESTIVAL TO THE DOG'S MEMORY
THE OLD MAN'S DISGUST CAN BE IMAGINED THIS SOON GAVE WAY TO ANGER
BUT THE DAIMIO LOOKING AT HIM THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE OLD MAN HE HAD SEEN BEFORE SO HE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE MAN WHOM I NAMED HANA SAKA JIJII AND THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR ANSWERED WITH A LIE YES MY LORD
THE OLD MAN THINKING THAT PERHAPS SOME BIRDS WERE ATTACKING THE CORN HURRIED OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AS SOON AS SHIRO SAW HIS MASTER HE RAN TO MEET HIM WAGGING HIS TAIL AND SEIZING THE END OF HIS KIMONO
IN THIS HIS WIFE PUT SOME RICE AND HE BEGAN TO POUND IT WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING A FESTIVAL TO THE MEMORY OF HIS DOG SHIRO A STRANGE THING HAPPENED HIS WIFE PUT THE RICE INTO THE MORTAR
THE HAPPIEST HOUR OF THE DAY BOTH FOR THE OLD MAN AND HIS DOG WAS WHEN THE MAN RETURNED FROM HIS WORK IN THE FIELD AND HAVING FINISHED HIS FRUGAL SUPPER OF RICE AND VEGETABLES
HE SEIZED HIS SPADE AND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH STRUCK SHIRO AND KILLED HIM ON THE SPOT HE THEN THREW THE DOG'S BODY INTO THE HOLE WHICH HE HAD DUG IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A TREASURE OF GOLD COINS AND COVERED IT OVER WITH THE EARTH
EVEN THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR COULD NOT REFUSE SUCH A SIMPLE REQUEST SO HE CONSENTED TO GIVE THE OLD MAN THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHIRO LAY BURIED SHIRO'S MASTER THEN CUT THE TREE DOWN AND CARRIED IT HOME OUT OF THE TRUNK HE MADE A MORTAR
WHERE IT FIRST SPRINGS OUT INTO THE AIR TO THE HEAD OF THE ROCKY TALUS ON WHICH IT STRIKES AND IS BROKEN UP INTO RAGGED CASCADES IT IS CALLED THE RIBBON FALL OR VIRGIN'S TEARS DURING THE SPRING FLOODS IT IS A MAGNIFICENT OBJECT
CLAD IN GAUZY SUN SIFTED SPRAY HALF FALLING HALF FLOATING IT SEEMS INFINITELY GENTLE AND FINE BUT THE HYMNS IT SINGS
THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HEARD BUT RESPECTFULLY FOLLOWED THE KNIGHT TO THE NOBLEMAN'S PALACE THE DAIMIO WHO HAD BEEN IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE OLD MAN'S COMING AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM ASKED HIM AT ONCE
WOULD TAKE WHAT HE HAD SAVED FROM THE MEAL OUT TO THE LITTLE VERANDA THAT RAN ROUND THE COTTAGE SURE ENOUGH SHIRO WAS WAITING FOR HIS MASTER AND THE EVENING TIT BIT THEN THE OLD MAN SAID CHIN CHIN AND SHIRO SAT UP AND BEGGED
THE OLD MAN WAS VERY PLEASED WHEN HE SAW THE DOG BEGIN TO SCRATCH AND DIG FOR HE AT ONCE SUPPOSED THAT SOME GOLD COINS LAY BURIED UNDER HIS TREE AS WELL AS UNDER HIS NEIGHBOR'S AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED THEM AS BEFORE
WITH SCENERY EVERY WAY WORTHY THE RELATION THEY BEAR TO YOSEMITE IN THE SOUTH BRANCH A MILE OR TWO FROM THE MAIN VALLEY IS THE ILLILOUETTE FALL SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE YOSEMITE CHOIR
SO INTENT WAS THE OLD MAN ON HIS WORK THAT HE NEVER SAW THE CROSS FACE OF HIS NEIGHBOR PEERING AT HIM THROUGH THE BAMBOO HEDGE AT LAST ALL THE GOLD COINS LAY SHINING ON THE GROUND
SAUNTERING UP THE VALLEY THROUGH MEADOW AND GROVE IN THE COMPANY OF THESE MAJESTIC ROCKS WHICH SEEM TO FOLLOW US AS WE ADVANCE GAZING ADMIRING LOOKING FOR NEW WONDERS AHEAD WHERE ALL ABOUT US IS SO WONDERFUL
OF THE ANCIENT YOSEMITE GLACIER ABOUT TEN MILES ABOVE THE VALLEY WE COME TO THE BEAUTIFUL TENAYA LAKE AND HERE THE CANYON TERMINATES A MILE OR TWO ABOVE THE LAKE STANDS THE GRAND SIERRA CATHEDRAL
ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE TELLING NO ONE NOT EVEN HIS WIFE WHAT HE HAD DONE AFTER WAITING SEVERAL DAYS AS THE DOG SHIRO DID NOT RETURN HIS MASTER BEGAN TO GROW ANXIOUS
THE OLD MAN DID NOT IN THE LEAST WISH TO LEND IT TO HIS CRUEL NEIGHBOR BUT HE WAS TOO KIND TO REFUSE SO THE ENVIOUS MAN CARRIED HOME THE MORTAR BUT HE NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK SEVERAL DAYS PASSED
THERE IS NO TRAIL OF ANY SORT BETWEEN MOUNT WATKINS AND CLOUDS REST THE CANYON IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO MOUNTAINEERS AND IT IS SO DANGEROUS THAT I HESITATE TO ADVISE EVEN GOOD CLIMBERS ANXIOUS TO TEST THEIR NERVE AND SKILL
THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR CAME TO SEE THE WONDERFUL SIGHT ONE DAY SOON AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN HEARD SOME ONE KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR
AND EVERYWHERE THE SURFACE OF THE GRANITE HAS A SMOOTH WIPED APPEARANCE AND IN MANY PLACES REFLECTS THE SUNBEAMS LIKE GLASS A PHENOMENON DUE TO GLACIAL ACTION THE CANYON HAVING BEEN THE CHANNEL OF ONE OF THE MAIN TRIBUTARIES
NEXT TO THE CATHEDRAL ROCKS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TOWERS THE SENTINEL ROCK TO A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FEET A TELLING MONUMENT OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
SO A FEW DAYS LATER HE CALLED AT THE OLD MAN'S HOUSE AND VERY CEREMONIOUSLY ASKED PERMISSION TO BORROW SHIRO FOR A SHORT TIME SHIRO'S MASTER THOUGHT THIS A STRANGE REQUEST
THEY AT ONCE KICKED HIM OR THREW SOMETHING AT HIM SOMETIMES EVEN WOUNDING HIM ONE DAY SHIRO WAS HEARD BARKING FOR A LONG TIME IN THE FIELD AT THE BACK OF HIS MASTER'S HOUSE
WHEN THERE HAD BEEN MUCH SNOW THE PRECEDING WINTER BUT IT VARIES GREATLY FROM MONTH TO MONTH THE SNOW RAPIDLY VANISHES FROM THE OPEN PORTION OF THE BASIN WHICH FACES SOUTHWARD AND ONLY A FEW OF THE TRIBUTARIES
IT WILL AMUSE ME TO LOOK ON SO THE RETAINERS WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE IMPOSTOR BEFORE THEIR LORD
WHOSE INFLUENCE IS SO MYSTERIOUS ON EVERY ONE WHO SEES IT OF THE SMALL GLACIER LAKES SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE UPPER REGIONS THERE ARE NO FEWER THAN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE BASIN OF THE MAIN MIDDLE BRANCH BESIDES COUNTLESS SMALLER POOLS
SO THAT SHIRO BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND DIG IN ORDER TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE HORRID OLD MAN'S GRASP
AND SEEMING TO SPRING OUT INTO THE VALLEY SUNSHINE DIRECT FROM THE SKY BUT EVEN THIS FALL PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD CANNOT AT FIRST HOLD OUR ATTENTION FOR NOW THE WIDE UPPER PORTION OF THE VALLEY IS DISPLAYED TO VIEW
THEIR ONLY PET WAS A DOG NAMED SHIRO AND ON HIM THEY LAVISHED ALL THE AFFECTION OF THEIR OLD AGE INDEED THEY LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT WHENEVER THEY HAD ANYTHING NICE TO EAT
AND NO SOONER HAD HE BEGUN TO POUND IT TO MAKE THE CAKES THAN IT BEGAN TO INCREASE IN QUANTITY GRADUALLY TILL IT WAS ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT AND THE CAKES WERE TURNED OUT OF THE MORTAR
THERE MUST ALSO BE GOLD COINS UNDER MY TREE YOU MUST FIND THEM FOR ME WHERE ARE THEY WHERE WHERE AND CATCHING HOLD OF SHIRO'S NECK HE HELD THE DOG'S HEAD TO THE GROUND
SHIRO SAT BY ERECT WITH PRIDE AND LOOKING FONDLY AT HIS MASTER AS IF TO SAY YOU SEE THOUGH ONLY A DOG I CAN MAKE SOME RETURN FOR ALL THE KINDNESS YOU SHOW ME THE OLD MAN RAN IN TO CALL HIS WIFE
BUT TO MOST PEOPLE INACCESSIBLE AS YET ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ROUGH STEEP BOULDER CHOKED CANYON
EVENING DO YOU REALIZE THAT I AM AN AUTHORITY ON THE CARE OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN TOMORROW I AND OTHER AUTHORITIES VISIT OFFICIALLY THE HEBREW SHELTERING GUARDIAN SOCIETY'S ORPHAN ASYLUM AT PLEASANTVILLE ALL THAT'S ITS NAME
AND I COULD SEE YOU AND JERVIS PLAINLY LEANING ON THE RAIL I WAVED FRANTICALLY BUT YOU NEVER BLINKED AN EYELASH YOUR GAZE WAS FIXED IN HOMESICK CONTEMPLATION UPON THE TOP OF THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING
SHE'S NOT SPECTACULAR BUT STEADY AND DEPENDABLE
HE SAID WE WERE NEVER TO WRITE A WORD FOR A LOW OR UNWORTHY MOTIVE BUT ALWAYS TO CLING TO THE VERY HIGHEST IDEALS
BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT I WON'T BE THE CENTER OF THE RIPPING UP AND I DO SO LOVE TO BE THE CENTER OF RIPPING UPS BUT ANYWAY YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE
ARE THEY BOUND FOR A REFORMATORY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NATURAL QUESTION AFTER OBSERVING THE TABLE MANNERS OF HER OFFSPRING MY LITTLE BAND TUMBLED IN TOWARD TEN O'CLOCK EXCITEDLY BABBLING A MESS OF STATISTICS ABOUT RECIPROCATING COMPOUND ENGINES AND WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS
HE WAVED ME ASIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE AND GROWLINGLY ASKED MISS SNAITH IF SHE COULDN'T ECONOMIZE A LITTLE ON CARBOLIC ACID THE HOUSE SMELT LIKE A HOSPITAL I MUST TELL YOU THAT PUNCH IS BACK WITH US AGAIN ENTIRELY RENOVATED AS TO MANNERS I AM LOOKING FOR A FAMILY TO ADOPT HIM
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE WASN'T A WORD IN MY STORY ABOUT ABOUT ANNE CHOKED A LITTLE OVER THE WORD BAKING POWDER OH I PUT THAT IN SAID DIANA REASSURED
PLEASING VISIONS WERE ALSO BEING WOVEN AROUND PATTY'S PLACE THERE WAS A WARM PLEASANT SENSE OF HOME IN THE THOUGHT OF IT EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LIVED THERE BUT THE SUMMER HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TOO A TIME OF GLAD LIVING WITH SUMMER SUNS AND SKIES A TIME OF KEEN DELIGHT IN WHOLESOME THINGS
AND OUR YELLOW DINING ROOM WITH ITS FRIEZE OF BUNNIES IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT REPORT AS MANY CHEERFUL DETAILS AS POSSIBLE TO THE POOR MOTHER AFTER THIS AS SHE SEEMED TIRED
THE BOYS HAVE SPENT THE MORNING IN THE WOODS GATHERING EVERGREENS AND DRAWING THEM HOME ON SLEDS AND TWENTY GIRLS ARE SPENDING THE AFTERNOON IN THE LAUNDRY
I FEEL JUST THE SAME I LOVED MY POOR LITTLE STORY AND I WROTE IT OUT OF THE BEST THAT WAS IN ME AND IT IS SACRILEGE TO HAVE IT DEGRADED TO THE LEVEL OF A BAKING POWDER ADVERTISEMENT
ISN'T IT FUNNY YOU'D THINK I MUST HAVE A DASH OF CREOLE OR SPANISH OR SOME WARM BLOOD IN ME SOMEWHERE BUT I'M NOTHING ON EARTH BUT A CHILLY MIXTURE OF ENGLISH AND IRISH AND SCOTCH
IT HAD BEEN A WARM SMOKY SUMMER AFTERNOON THE WORLD WAS IN A SPLENDOR OF OUT FLOWERING THE IDLE VALLEYS WERE FULL OF HAZES THE WOODWAYS WERE PRANKED WITH SHADOWS AND THE FIELDS WITH THE PURPLE OF THE ASTERS
WHY I HEARD PRISCILLA SAY ONCE THAT THE CANADIAN WOMAN ONLY PAYS FIVE DOLLARS FOR A STORY ANNE HELD OUT THE HATEFUL PINK SLIP IN SHAKING FINGERS I CAN'T TAKE IT IT'S YOURS BY RIGHT DIANA YOU SENT THE STORY IN AND MADE THE ALTERATIONS I
BUT IT DIDN'T KILL HER IT ONLY MADE HER SICK AND HE CAME BACK AND SAID HE WOULD CHOKE HER IF SHE EVER TRIED THAT ON HIM AGAIN SO SHE GUESSED HE MUST STILL CARE SOMETHING FOR HER ALL THIS QUITE CASUALLY WHILE SHE STIRRED HER TEA
IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS JUDSON PARKER'S PATENT MEDICINE FENCE SO SPAKE ANNE LOFTILY LITTLE DREAMING OF THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AWAITING HER THAT VERY EVENING DIANA POPPED INTO THE PORCH GABLE BRIGHT EYED AND ROSY CHEEKED CARRYING A LETTER
WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MATTER WITH YOU SANDY YOU USED TO BE A TOLERABLY NICE MAN IN SPOTS
AND DEEP WOMANHOOD JOYS MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR RUBY ANNE LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS AT HER OLD PLAYFELLOW THOUGHT SHE SAW THE FACE GOD HAD MEANT RUBY TO HAVE AND REMEMBERED IT SO ALWAYS
AND THIS PLEASANTVILLE ASYLUM IS AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL I ACKNOWLEDGE NOW UPON SOBER REFLECTION THAT WE WERE WISE TO POSTPONE EXTENSIVE BUILDING OPERATIONS UNTIL NEXT SUMMER OF COURSE I WAS DISAPPOINTED
THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE HANDLE BABIES IN THE J G H NURSERY PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE ARTIST HAS GIVEN JERVIS HIS FULL DUE IN THE MATTER OF LEGS WHEN I ASKED PUNCH WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE CAPTAIN
AS IF AFTER ALL DEATH HAD COME AS A KINDLY FRIEND TO LEAD HER OVER THE THRESHOLD INSTEAD OF THE GRISLY PHANTOM SHE HAD DREADED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SAID EMPHATICALLY AFTER THE FUNERAL THAT RUBY GILLIS WAS THE HANDSOMEST CORPSE SHE EVER LAID EYES ON HER LOVELINESS
OWING TO THE LOSS OF MY BLUE PENCIL OUR FLAG HAS HAD TO ADOPT THE ITALIAN COLORS THE THREE FIGURES ON THE BRIDGE ARE YOU AND JERVIS AND THE BABY I AM PAINED TO NOTE THAT YOU CARRY YOUR DAUGHTER BY THE BACK OF HER NECK AS IF SHE WERE A KITTEN
YOU KNOW IT'S RATHER DREADFUL TO LAUGH IN CHURCH BUT HEAVEN WON'T BE LIKE CHURCH ALL THE TIME SAID ANNE I HOPE IT AIN'T SAID DAVY EMPHATICALLY
SHE INTIMATED A DESIRE TO LOOK ABOUT
BUT AT LEAST COMPARED WITH STERRY TURNFELT IS A SCHOLARD AND SPEAKING OF STERRY HE PAID US A SOCIAL CALL A FEW DAYS AGO IN QUITE A CHASTENED FRAME OF MIND IT SEEMS THAT THE RICH CITY FELLER WHOSE ESTATE HE HAS BEEN MANAGING NO LONGER NEEDS HIS SERVICES
I SUGGESTED A CHANGE AND SENT HIM HOME WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN BUT HE BROUGHT IT BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
MEN ARE SO GOOD AT TALKING GOOD BY AND A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO JERVIS AND BOTH JUDIES S MC B
IT'S A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AND ROUNDABOUT JOURNEY FROM THIS POINT INVOLVING A DAYBREAK START AND TWO TRAINS AND AN AUTOMOBILE BUT IF I'M TO BE AN AUTHORITY I MUST LIVE UP TO THE TITLE I'M KEEN ABOUT LOOKING OVER OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND GLEANING AS MANY IDEAS AS POSSIBLE AGAINST OUR OWN ALTERATIONS NEXT YEAR
I'M DIVIDING MY CHICKS INTO BIG AND LITTLE SISTERS AND BROTHERS EACH BIG ONE TO HAVE A LITTLE ONE TO LOVE AND HELP AND FIGHT FOR BIG SISTER SADIE KATE HAS TO SEE THAT LITTLE SISTER GLADIOLA ALWAYS HAS HER HAIR NEATLY COMBED
I GO ABOUT PLANNING AND PLANNING THEIR BABY FUTURES FEELING THAT I'M CONSTRUCTING THE NATION WHATEVER BECOMES OF ME IN AFTER LIFE
HAD BEEN DROPPED INTO THE POST OFFICE BOX A MONTH AGO
I SUPPOSE JUDGING FROM THE THEATERS THIS WINTER
MY CHILDREN ARE GETTING TO BE ALMOST LIKE REAL CHILDREN
DEAR RUBY I KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS IT SAID RUBY BITTERLY
ALWAYS CHATTERING AND WHISPERING OF HER BEAUX AND THEIR RIVALRIES AND DESPAIRS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ANNE'S VISITS HARD FOR HER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SILLY OR AMUSING WAS GRUESOME NOW IT WAS DEATH PEERING THROUGH A WILFUL MASK OF LIFE
AND AFTER LUNCHEON THEY VISITED THE AQUARIUM AND THE TOP OF THE SINGER BUILDING AND TOOK THE SUBWAY UPTOWN TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH THE BIRDS OF AMERICA IN THEIR HABITATS SANDY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PRIED THEM AWAY FROM THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN TIME TO CATCH THE SIX FIFTEEN TRAIN
WHEN HE FIRST CAME I MADE HIM FREE OF THE LIBRARY HE BEGAN AT THE CASE NEAREST THE DOOR WHICH CONTAINS THIRTY SEVEN VOLUMES OF PANSY'S WORKS
AND STERRY HAS GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED TO RETURN TO US AND LET THE CHILDREN HAVE GARDENS IF THEY WISH I KINDLY BUT CONVINCINGLY DECLINED HIS OFFER FRIDAY I CAME BACK FROM PLEASANTVILLE LAST NIGHT WITH A HEART FULL OF ENVY PLEASE MISTER PRESIDENT
THE KITCHEN FIRE WENT WITH HER THE PIPES ARE FROZEN
LIFE HELD A DIFFERENT MEANING A DEEPER PURPOSE ON THE SURFACE IT WOULD GO ON JUST THE SAME BUT THE DEEPS HAD BEEN STIRRED IT MUST NOT BE WITH HER AS WITH POOR BUTTERFLY RUBY
AS I WAS ENTERING THROUGH THEIR REVOLVING DOORS
AND I NEVER COULD FIND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD THREE NICER MEN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THEM JUST THINK OF ALL THAT HEALTHY EXUBERANT VOLUNTEER SERVICE GOING TO WASTE UNDER THE ASYLUM'S NOSE I SUPPOSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS FULL OF PLENTY MORE OF IT AND I AM GOING TO MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO DIG IT OUT
WAS SADIE KATE'S SKEPTICAL QUESTION BUT SANTA CLAUS IS UNDOUBTEDLY COMING THIS TIME I ASKED THE DOCTOR OUT OF POLITENESS TO PLAY THE CHIEF ROLE AT OUR CHRISTMAS TREE AND BEING CERTAIN AHEAD OF TIME THAT HE WAS GOING TO REFUSE
ANNE INSTANTLY MANUFACTURED A SMILE AND PUT IT ON OF COURSE I COULDN'T BE ANYTHING BUT PLEASED OVER YOUR UNSELFISH WISH TO GIVE ME PLEASURE SHE SAID SLOWLY BUT YOU KNOW I'M SO AMAZED I CAN'T REALIZE IT
I TRIED TO MAKE THE WOMAN TAKE HATTIE HEAPHY INSTEAD THE QUIET LITTLE ONE WHO STOLE THE COMMUNION CUP BUT NO INDEED
HAS SHE A NICE HUSBAND
SOMETHING FOR WHICH ACCUSTOMED THOUGHT AND IDEAL AND ASPIRATION HAD UNFITTED HER THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE SWEET AND EXCELLENT IN THEIR PLACE MUST NOT BE THE THINGS LIVED FOR THE HIGHEST MUST BE SOUGHT AND FOLLOWED THE LIFE OF HEAVEN MUST BE BEGUN HERE ON EARTH
THE TRUSTEES MEETING LAST WEEK WENT BEAUTIFULLY THE NEW WOMEN ARE MOST HELPFUL AND ONLY THE NICE MEN CAME I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE HON CY WYKOFF IS VISITING HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER IN SCRANTON I WISH SHE WOULD INVITE FATHER TO LIVE WITH HER PERMANENTLY
DINNER IN THE DINING CAR THEY INQUIRED WITH GREAT PARTICULARITY HOW MUCH IT WAS COSTING AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT IT WAS THE SAME NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ATE THEY DREW DEEP BREATHS AND SETTLED QUIETLY AND STEADILY TO THE TASK OF NOT ALLOWING THEIR HOST TO BE CHEATED
FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO SAID I
TO WORK MORE PATIENTLY TO PLAY MORE HEARTILY ALL LIFE LESSONS ARE NOT LEARNED AT COLLEGE SHE THOUGHT LIFE TEACHES THEM EVERYWHERE BUT ALAS THE FINAL WEEK OF THAT PLEASANT VACATION WAS SPOILED FOR ANNE
THANKING YOU FOR THE INTEREST YOU HAVE SHOWN IN OUR ENTERPRISE WE REMAIN YOURS VERY TRULY
WON'T YOU PLEASE EXPUNGE THAT UNFORTUNATE FIFTEEN MINUTES AT THE PORTE COCHERE LAST JUNE AND REMEMBER INSTEAD THE FIFTEEN HOURS I SPENT READING THE KALLIKAK FAMILY
AS YOU DISCOVERED LAST SUMMER THIS SPACIOUS CHATEAU DOES NOT CONTAIN A SUPERABUNDANCE OF GUEST ROOMS
BUT I SIMPLY HAD TO COME AND HEAR THE NEWS I'M SO GLAD FOR YOUR SAKE ANNE ANNE SUDDENLY BENT FORWARD PUT HER ARMS ABOUT DIANA AND KISSED HER CHEEK I THINK YOU ARE THE SWEETEST AND TRUEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD DIANA SHE SAID
FIVE OF MY CHILDREN ARE READY TO BE SHOVED BUT I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT I KEEP REMEMBERING MY OWN IRRESPONSIBLE SILLY YOUNG SELF AND WONDERING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME HAD I BEEN TURNED OUT TO WORK AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
SAID RUBY INSISTENTLY YES I KNOW
SPIRIT HAD NEVER SHONE THROUGH IT INTELLECT HAD NEVER REFINED IT BUT DEATH HAD TOUCHED IT AND CONSECRATED IT BRINGING OUT DELICATE MODELINGS AND PURITY OF OUTLINE NEVER SEEN BEFORE DOING WHAT LIFE AND LOVE AND GREAT SORROW
WITH THE UTMOST CALLOUSNESS
SISTER IN A SANATORIUM FOR TUBERCULOSIS
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS SHE SOBBED RUBY WOULD HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE IT IT'S THE EMBROIDERED CENTERPIECE SHE WAS WORKING AT IT ISN'T QUITE FINISHED THE NEEDLE IS STICKING IN IT JUST WHERE HER POOR LITTLE FINGERS PUT IT THE LAST TIME SHE LAID IT DOWN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE SHE DIED
NO ONE COULD SEE ANY REASON FOR A DIVORCE THE PATHETIC PART OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS THAT BOTH SHE AND HENRY WERE ADMIRABLY FITTED TO MAKE SOME ONE ELSE HAPPY THEY JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T MATCH EACH OTHER AND WHEN TWO PEOPLE DON'T MATCH ALL THE CEREMONIES IN THE WORLD CAN'T MARRY THEM
BUT WHEN I DO I SETTLE WORLD PROBLEMS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNE BLANKLY DIANA CLAPPED HER HANDS
ALL THEIR SEVEN LIVES THEY VISITED ONE OF THE BIG LINERS SANDY KNOWS THE SCOTCH ENGINEER AND WERE CONDUCTED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLD TO THE TOP OF THE CROW'S NEST AND THEN HAD LUNCHEON ON BOARD
HATES TO HAVE CHILDREN MESSING ABOUT THEY MAKE HER NERVOUS AND AS FOR TURNFELT HIMSELF THOUGH INDUSTRIOUS AND METHODICAL AND AN EXCELLENT GARDENER STILL HIS MENTAL PROCESSES ARE NOT QUITE WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR
GLAD TO SEE YOU HOW ARE YOU AND GONE ON AND YET THEY MARRIED ISN'T IT DREADFUL HOW BLIND THIS SEX BUSINESS CAN MAKE PEOPLE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE THEORY THAT A WOMAN'S ONLY LEGITIMATE PROFESSION IS HOMEMAKING WHEN SHE FINISHED COLLEGE SHE WAS NATURALLY EAGER TO START ON HER CAREER
THIS IS APROPOS OF A CALL I RECEIVED TODAY
IT ISN'T THAT I LIKE HIM ANY THE LESS BUT I AM GETTING TO LIKE ORPHANS THE MORE I JUST MET OUR MEDICAL ADVISER A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE WAS EMERGING FROM THE NURSERY
MERCY
PARTLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUSTIFY THEIR JUDGMENT PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN GIVING THE POOR LITTLE KIDDIES THEIR SHARE OF HAPPINESS BUT MOSTLY I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
AND HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LOVED BABIES ANNE
WE'VE JUST HAD ONE OF THOSE MISERABLE DECEIVING NIGHTS COLD AND FROSTY WHEN YOU GO TO BED AND WARM AND LIFELESS WHEN YOU WAKE IN THE DARK SMOTHERED UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF BLANKETS

AND HE SPENT ALL OF HIS MONEY ON THE GIRL AND NEVER CAME HOME EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS DRUNK THEN HE SMASHED THE FURNITURE SOMETHING AWFUL
WE ARE RUNNING ALONG HERE VERY MUCH AS USUAL WITHOUT ANYTHING EXCITING TO CHRONICLE YOU REMEMBER LITTLE MAYBELLE FULLER DON'T YOU THE CHORUS GIRL'S DAUGHTER WHOM OUR DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE
YOU KNOW HOW FOOLISH AND SILLY I AM ON OCCASIONS
I HAVE THIRTY COLLECTORS IN THE FAMILY SINCE YOU HAVE TAKEN TO TRAVEL EVERY DAY ABOUT POST TIME AN EAGER GROUP GATHERS AT THE GATE WAITING TO SNATCH ANY LETTERS OF FOREIGN DESIGN
LEAVING HER PALE AND CHILDLIKE THE MOON ROSE IN THE SILVERY SKY EMPEARLING THE CLOUDS AROUND HER BELOW THE POND SHIMMERED IN ITS HAZY RADIANCE JUST BEYOND THE GILLIS HOMESTEAD WAS THE CHURCH WITH THE OLD GRAVEYARD BESIDE IT
I DO WISH I COULD MANAGE BREAKS IN THE ROUTINE OFTENER
I'VE WANTED TO ALL SUMMER EVERY TIME YOU CAME I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU BUT I COULDN'T
BUT ANNE WOULD NOT TALK OF THESE THINGS SHE SEEMED WRAPPED IN A REVERIE IN WHICH DIANA FELT LONESOMELY THAT SHE HAD NEITHER LOT NOR PART RUBY GILLIS WAS A GREAT GIRL TO LAUGH SAID DAVY SUDDENLY
ANYTHING LIKE THAT SEEMS SILLY NOW BUT EM AND I MADE UP THE OLD QUARREL YESTERDAY
THE TWO BUILDING DETAILS WE DID ACCOMPLISH ARE VERY PROMISING OUR NEW LAUNDRY GROWS BETTER AND BETTER
HAS GONE AND MARRIED HERSELF TO A MAN AND A COUPLE OF AUTOMOBILES AND A YACHT
NO ANSWERED ANNE RATHER CRISPLY WELL NO OFFENSE MEANT
I WOULDN'T SAY IT OR EVEN THINK IT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN PEOPLE WERE AROUND ME AND EVERYTHING WAS CHEERFUL IT WASN'T SO HARD TO KEEP FROM THINKING OF IT BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN I COULDN'T SLEEP IT WAS SO DREADFUL ANNE I COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM IT THEN
DEVIL FISH AND SKY SCRAPERS AND BIRDS OF PARADISE
AND I'D RATHER HAVE YOU THAN ANY ONE ELSE I ALWAYS LIKED YOU BEST OF ALL THE GIRLS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU WERE NEVER JEALOUS OR MEAN LIKE SOME OF THEM
NOTHING IN MY FOUR TRIPS TO EUROPE EVER THRILLED ME LIKE THE QUEER SIGHTS AND TASTES AND SMELLS OF THOSE THREE WARM WEEKS SEVEN YEARS AGO AND EVER SINCE I'VE PANTED TO GET BACK WHEN I STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT
DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A THRILL IN THE WHOLE OF YOUR LIFE BARRING ONE OR TWO CONNECTED WITH JERVIS
I WANT TO KNOW YES I THINK SHE WILL SAID ANNE OH ANNE PROTESTED DIANA WITH A RATHER SHOCKED SMILE WELL WHY NOT DIANA ASKED ANNE SERIOUSLY DO YOU THINK WE'LL NEVER LAUGH IN HEAVEN OH I I DON'T KNOW FLOUNDERED DIANA
IT SEEMS A TERRIBLE TASK TO TELL YOU MY TROUBLES IN TONES THAT WILL REACH TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTINENT
HOW ANNE HAD ENVIED THOSE BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS IN OLD SCHOOLDAYS LAY ON EITHER SIDE OF HER SHE HAD TAKEN THE PINS OUT THEY MADE HER HEAD ACHE SHE SAID
AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE THE NEARNESS TO HUMANITY THAT AN ASYLUM BRINGS I AM LEARNING SO MANY NEW THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WHEN EACH SATURDAY NIGHT COMES I LOOK BACK ON THE SALLIE OF LAST SATURDAY NIGHT AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD REVOLVE ETERNALLY BUT WE FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND SHOOK HANDS AND SHE OBLIGINGLY HELPED ME CHOOSE FIFTEEN DOZEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AND FIFTY CAPS AND SWEATERS AND TWO HUNDRED UNION SUITS AND THEN WE GOSSIPED ALL THE WAY UP TO FIFTY SECOND STREET WHERE WE HAD LUNCHEON AT THE WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY CLUB
WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT HOLDS FOR US I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIFE HERE AS MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK I BELIEVE WE'LL JUST GO ON LIVING A GOOD DEAL AS WE LIVE HERE AND BE OURSELVES JUST THE SAME
OH YES HE WOULD TOO I'M AFRAID I'M SLANDERING HIM BABIES AT LEAST BOY BABIES GROW INTO VOTERS GOOD BY SALLIE DEAREST JUDY IF YOU EXPECT A CHEERFUL LETTER FROM ME THE DAY DON'T READ THIS
AND CERTAINLY I AM NOT DOING IT TO FIND MY LIFE WORK
AS SHE LAY WHITE CLAD AMONG THE DELICATE FLOWERS THAT ANNE HAD PLACED ABOUT HER WAS REMEMBERED AND TALKED OF FOR YEARS IN AVONLEA RUBY HAD ALWAYS BEEN BEAUTIFUL BUT HER BEAUTY HAD BEEN OF THE EARTH EARTHY
BUT AS SHE WENT ON PILING UP DETAIL ON DETAIL EACH TRIVIAL IN ITSELF BUT MAKING A MOUNTAINOUS TOTAL I AGREED WITH HELEN THAT IT WAS AWFUL TO KEEP IT GOING IT WASN'T REALLY A MARRIAGE IT WAS A MISTAKE
SHE HAD SO SPENT MANY EVENINGS THAT SUMMER ALTHOUGH SHE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT GOOD IT DID ANY ONE AND SOMETIMES WENT HOME DECIDING THAT SHE COULD NOT GO AGAIN RUBY GREW PALER AS THE SUMMER WANED THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL WAS GIVEN UP
INDEED NO I SAW THE PRIZE OFFER BUT I'D NEVER DREAM OF COMPETING FOR IT
I HAD ALREADY ENGAGED PERCY AS AN UNDERSTUDY BUT THERE IS NO COUNTING ON A SCOTCHMAN SANDY ACCEPTED WITH UNPRECEDENTED GRACIOUSNESS
AND HOMESICK HEAVEN MUST BE VERY BEAUTIFUL OF COURSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO BUT ANNE IT WON'T BE WHAT I'VE BEEN USED TO
I THOUGHT OF THOSE FOURTEEN BUNDLED UP BABIES IN THE FRESH AIR NURSERY THEIR SO CALLED NIGHT NURSE SLEEPS LIKE A TOP THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH HER NAME IS NEXT ON THE LIST TO BE EXPUNGED
THAT GOOD NIGHT IN THE GARDEN WAS FOR ALL TIME ANNE NEVER SAW RUBY IN LIFE AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT THE A V I S GAVE A FAREWELL PARTY TO JANE ANDREWS BEFORE HER DEPARTURE FOR THE WEST AND WHILE LIGHT FEET DANCED AND BRIGHT EYES LAUGHED AND MERRY TONGUES CHATTERED
NEVER SAW A HAPPIER MARRIAGE IT STRUCK ME THAT HELEN LOOKED A TRIFLE BLEAK AND I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED ALL THAT GOSSIP THAT MARTY KEENE TOLD US LAST SUMMER SO I HASTILY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION TO A PERFECTLY SAFE SUBJECT LIKE ORPHANS
BUT THE SHACKS WERE SCARCELY PLANNED FOR WINTER QUARTERS
HER ORDERLINESS MADE HIM IMPATIENT AND HIS DISORDERLINESS DROVE HER WILD SHE WOULD SPEND A DAY GETTING CLOSETS AND BUREAU DRAWERS IN ORDER AND IN FIVE MINUTES HE WOULD STIR THEM INTO CHAOS
BUT MEANWHILE BOARD AND TUITION FEES HAVE TO BE PAID
AND SENT HER AWAY ACTUALLY UPLIFTED
BUT NOW IT WAS NO WONDER HER SOUL CLUNG IN BLIND HELPLESSNESS TO THE ONLY THINGS SHE KNEW AND LOVED
THERE CAME A SUMMONS TO A SOUL IN AVONLEA THAT MIGHT NOT BE DISREGARDED OR EVADED THE NEXT MORNING THE WORD WENT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE THAT RUBY GILLIS WAS DEAD SHE HAD DIED IN HER SLEEP PAINLESSLY AND CALMLY AND ON HER FACE WAS A SMILE
A GOOD SENSIBLE WORKADAY INSTITUTION BUT AWFULLY CURBING TO ONE'S LIBERTY SOMEHOW AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED FOREVER LIFE HAS LOST ITS FEELING OF ADVENTURE THERE AREN'T ANY ROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES WAITING TO SURPRISE YOU AROUND EACH CORNER
IN WHICH WE WILL NEVER USE ANY BAKING POWDER EXCEPT ROLLINGS RELIABLE OH GASPED POOR ANNE
DEATH JUST CAME AND STARED ME IN THE FACE UNTIL I GOT SO FRIGHTENED
ANNE PRESSED HER HAND IN AN AGONY OF SYMPATHY
DOCTOR MAC RAE BEING AT HAND AND IN A HUNGRY MOOD A RARE STATE FOR HIM
THE GILLISES MUST ALWAYS MAKE A SPLURGE EVEN AT FUNERALS QUOTH MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE HERB SPENCER'S SAD FACE
AND HENRY PRESENTED HIMSELF HER FAMILY SCANNED HIM CLOSELY AND FOUND HIM PERFECT IN EVERY RESPECT GOOD FAMILY GOOD MORALS GOOD FINANCIAL POSITION GOOD LOOKING HELEN WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM
ONLY IT WILL BE EASIER TO BE GOOD AND TO FOLLOW THE HIGHEST ALL THE HINDRANCES AND PERPLEXITIES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY AND WE SHALL SEE CLEARLY DON'T BE AFRAID RUBY I CAN'T HELP IT SAID RUBY PITIFULLY
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW BEFORE I'LL BE LYING OVER THERE YOU AND DIANA AND ALL THE REST WILL BE GOING ABOUT FULL OF LIFE AND I'LL BE THERE IN THE OLD GRAVEYARD DEAD THE SURPRISE OF IT BEWILDERED ANNE FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE COULD NOT SPEAK YOU KNOW IT'S SO DON'T YOU
BY ONE OF THOSE IMPISH HAPPENINGS WHICH ARE LIKE A DREAM TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BEEN WRITING ANY MORE STORIES LATELY INQUIRED MISTER HARRISON GENIALLY ONE EVENING WHEN ANNE WAS TAKING TEA WITH HIM AND MISSUS HARRISON
AND HE NEVER SCRUBBED OUT THE TUB AND SHE
AND THEY FEEL HE'S TOO CONSUMING OF THEIR LIBERTY I INCLOSE A SKETCH IN COLORED CHALK OF YOUR STEAMER WHICH HE HAS JUST COMPLETED THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS GOING IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT MIGHT PROGRESS BACKWARD AND END IN BROOKLYN
CAST HERSELF ON HER BED AND WEPT TEARS OF SHAME AND OUTRAGED SENSIBILITY OH SHE COULD NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN NEVER GILBERT ARRIVED AT DUSK BRIMMING OVER WITH CONGRATULATIONS
HE'S NEVER BEEN MIXED UP IN ANY DIRTY BUSINESS AND AS HE'S CARRIED OUT ONE OR TWO POLITICAL MISSIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES I SUPPOSE HE'S HAD TO KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY I EXPECT TO HAVE THE RECORDS OF BOTH IVAN ABRAMOVITCH AND CONDIT IT WILL ALL HELP THOUGH THE BEARING ON THE MURDER IS PERHAPS INDIRECT
THE CASHIER WAS CONFIDENT THAT HIS INITIALS IN BLUE PENCIL ON THE COUNTERFOIL WERE GENUINE YET HE WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY THE TRADESMAN WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY THERE IT WAS I WAS AT A DEAD END ONE DAY I NOTICED A LITTLE STATIONER'S STORE NEAR THE TRADESMAN'S OFFICE
GRACE'S MOTHER WAS JUSTLY HORRIFIED WHEN GRACE IN HER BEDRAGGLED CONDITION WALKED INTO THE LIVING ROOM SHE INSISTED ON PUTTING HER TO BED WRAPPING HER IN BLANKETS AND GIVING HER HOT DRINKS GRACE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL EVENING
TO SEND A CAR FROM LONDON TO KINGSTON RAILWAY STATION UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WOULD BE LESS RISKY HE WENT INTO THE TAILOR'S PLACE TO ARRANGE FOR A CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND SHE DISMISSED THE TAXI AS A MEASURE OF PRECAUTION IT WAS A PIECE OF LUCK THAT THE MAN NOTICED THE MOTOR CAR BUT WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE NUMBER HE GAVE
I DON'T THINK IT LIKELY IT WOULD DOUBLE THE DANGER OF IDENTIFICATION BUT WE CAN SOON FIND IF SHE'S GONE BACK TO HER HOME I TOLD TAYLOR WHO IS WATCHING IN BERKELEY SQUARE TO REPORT WHEN SHE RETURNED HE TOUCHED A BELL AND PUT A QUESTION TO THE MAN WHO ENTERED YES SIR WAS THE REPLY HE RANG UP HALF AN HOUR AGO
AND ALSO SMASHED THREE BEFORE MY FATHER HAD THIS ONE MADE TO ORDER
I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT IT WAS ONCE MINE IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE ESPECIALLY STRONG OBSERVED REDDY IT WAS HICKORY AND IRON WERE THE MATERIALS USED I BELIEVE
ANYWAY I'LL SEND IT OUT TO THE COUNTY POLICE AND ASK THEM TO KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN
BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THE FOUR BOYS WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE HARLOWE'S THEY CREPT QUIETLY UP TO THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW GRACE SAT BY THE FIRE READING VERY SOFTLY THEY BEGAN A POPULAR SONG THAT WAS A FAVORITE OF HERS GRACE'S QUICK EARS CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
WITH THE HELP OF PINKERTON'S I'VE TRACED HIS HISTORY BACK FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS HE'S HAD HIS HANDS IN SOME QUEER EPISODES IN HIS TIME BEFORE HE BECAME A MILLIONAIRE THERE ARE GAPS WHICH WE CAN'T FILL UP OF COURSE BUT WE'RE PRETTY COMPLETE THERE WAS ONE THING IN HIS FAVOUR ALTHOUGH HE'S KNOWN TOUGHS IN ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD
THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE SHE CRIED THEY MAY DROWN AT ANY MOMENT COME COME QUICKLY AND HELP ME SAVE THEM THE MAN LOOKED AT HER WITH A STRANGE FAR AWAY EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
BEVERLY WENT A SHADE WHITER HER INTEREST IN EVERYTHING ELSE FLAGGED AND SHE WAS LOST IN BEWILDERMENT WHAT FREAK OF FORTUNE HAD SENT THESE MEN OUT OF THE FASTNESSES INTO THIS DANGEROUSLY OPEN PLACE SHE RECOGNIZED THE ASCETIC RAVONE WITH HIS STUDENT'S FACE AND BEGGAR'S GARB
YOU TOLD ME I WASN'T TO DISTURB YOU HE REPORTED LADY EILEEN MEREDITH HAD JUST GONE IN THERE YOU ARE THEN GREEN SAID FOYLE THAT POINT'S SETTLED YOU GET ALONG I WISH I COULD COME WITH YOU BUT IT WON'T DO FOR ME TO LEAVE LONDON JUST NOW AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TO FINISH UP GOOD BYE AND GOOD LUCK
AND REPLACING IT IN THE SAFE SWUNG THE HEAVY DOOR TO THE JIG SAW PUZZLE TO WHICH HE HAD LIKENED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WAS NOT SO JUMBLED AS IT HAD BEEN ONE OR TWO BITS OF THE PICTURE WERE BEGINNING TO STICK TOGETHER THOUGH THERE WERE OTHERS THAT DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY POINTS OF JUNCTION
A LOCAL MAN SPOTTED HER AND CAME BACK TO FETCH ME TO MAKE CERTAIN OF HER IDENTITY
OH SCHOOLBOYS BUY EM SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHO SERVED ME
HE COULD RIDE LIKE A COSSACK OR LIKE AN AMERICAN COWBOY OF THEM ALL HIS WARMEST ADMIRER WAS HADDAN THE MAN SET TO WATCH HIM FOR THE SECRET SERVICE IT MAY BE TIMELY TO STATE THAT HADDAN WATCHED IN VAIN THE PRINCESS HUMORING HER OWN FANCY AS WELL AS BEVERLY'S FOIBLES
I REMEMBER SEEING YOU IN THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER RECENTLY THAT WAS A FACER FOR YETIVE I ASSURE YOU THAT IT WAS NO FAULT OF MINE THAT YOU SAW ME SHE REPLIED THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR FRIEND WHO RUSTLED THE CURTAINS SAID THE CONFOUNDED BLUFFER YETIVE COULDN'T KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE SHE LAUGHED AND THEN HE LAUGHED
THE TALL LEADER WITH THE RED FEATHER THE RAKISH HAT AND THE BLACK PATCH ALONE WAS MISSING FROM THE PICTURE IT'S THE STRANGEST LOOKING CREW I'VE EVER SEEN SAID ANGUISH THEY LOOK LIKE PIRATES OR GYPSIES SUGGESTED YETIVE WHO ARE THEY COLONEL QUINNOX WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE
CATCH HOLD OF THE TAIL PIECE TOM SHE CRIED FORTUNATELY THE ICE WAS VERY ROUGH WHERE THE GIRLS WERE STANDING OR THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SLIPPED AND FALLEN
GRACE SOON SAW HOWEVER THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT ENTIRELY IDIOTIC LATER SHE WAS TO OFFER UP A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR THAT SAME CHILD'S WAGON THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WAS WEARING HEAVY ARCTIC RUBBERS WHICH KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHILE GRACE WHOSE SOLES WERE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
TWO THREE WEEKS WENT BY AND THE NEW GUARD WAS BECOMING AN OLD STORY TO THE CASTLE AND ARMY FOLK HE RODE WITH BEVERLY EVERY FAIR DAY AND HE LOOKED AT HER WINDOW BY NIGHT FROM AFAR OFF IN THE SOMBRE BARRACKS SHE COULD NOT DISSIPATE THE FEELING THAT HE KNEW HER TO BE OTHER THAN THE PRINCESS
I AM A HIGHNESS ONCE IN A WHILE DON'T YOU KNOW I IMPLORE YOUR HIGHNESS'S PARDON SAID HE GAILY THE RIDERS AHEAD HAD COME TO A STANDSTILL AND WERE POINTING OFF INTO THE PASS TO THEIR RIGHT THEY WERE EIGHT OR TEN MILES FROM THE CITY GATES AND MORE THAN HALF WAY UP THE WINDING ROAD THAT ENDED AT THE MONASTERY GATES
WE'RE AFTER HER NOW SHE'S ONLY GOT HALF AN HOUR'S START AND WE'VE WIRED TO HAVE THE MAIN ROADS WATCHED I EXPECT WE'LL HAVE HER IN AN HOUR OR TWO THE SUPERINTENDENT COUGHED GET ALONG THEN BLAKE AND DON'T SMOKE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE JOB THIS TIME GOOD BYE
HE PRODUCED CERTAIN PAPERS OF IDENTIFICATION WHICH QUINNOX EXAMINED AND APPROVED MUCH TO BEVERLY'S SECRET AMAZEMENT THE PRINCESS AND THE COLONEL EXCHANGED GLANCES AND AFTERWARDS A FEW WORDS IN SUBDUED TONES
IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO TELL HER WHO COMPRISED THE UNUSUAL COMPANY THE VERY RAGGEDNESS OF THEIR GARMENTS THE UNFORGETABLE DISREGARD FOR CONSEQUENCES THE IMPUDENT EASE WITH WHICH THEY FACED POVERTY AND WEALTH ALIKE BELONGED TO BUT ONE SET OF MEN THE VAGABONDS OF THE HAWK AND RAVEN
RODE RECKLESSLY AFTER QUINNOX WAS QUESTIONING THE LACONIC RAVONE WHEN SHE DREW REIN THE VAGABONDS SEEMED TO EVINCE BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS THEY STOOD AWAY IN DISDAINFUL ALOOFNESS NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND BALDOS
TOM TOM GRAY SHE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU RUN FOR HELP CAME THE ANSWER IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAW THEM CLINGING TO A BROKEN LEDGE OF ICE TOM SUPPORTING JULIA CROSBY AS FOR THE JUNIOR CAPTAIN SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HERSELF
IN HIS OWN ROOM HE UNLOCKED THE BIG SAFE THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE TWO WINDOWS AND TAKING OUT THE ROLL HE HAD ABSTRACTED FROM LADY EILEEN'S DESK SURVEYED IT WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE PLAYING ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH ONCE HE HELD IT TO THE MIRROR AND THE WORD BURGHLEY WAS PLAINLY REFLECTED
I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE MY WAY SO HAD THE BOY CALLED OUT OF HIS CLASS INTO A PRIVATE ROOM NOW TELL ME MY BOY I SAID WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MONEY YOU STOLE FROM YOUR FATHER ON SUCH AND SUCH A DATE THE BLUFF WORKED HE TURNED PALE AND THEN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FORGED THE INITIALS
FOYLE PULLED OUT THE DOSSIER OF THE CASE AND AGAIN WENT OVER THE EVIDENCE THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED HE KNEW IT PRACTICALLY BY HEART BUT ONE COULD NEVER BE TOO CERTAIN THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED HE WAS SO ENGAGED WHEN MISTER FRED TREVELYAN WAS ANNOUNCED
THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WHO HELPED YOU OUT IS QUITE A CHARACTER SAID HIPPY I KNOW HIM WELL HE USED TO WORK FOR MY FATHER HE ISN'T HALF SO FOOLISH AS HE LOOKS EITHER
AND PUFFING A RING OF SMOKE INTO THE AIR HE TOLD IN BARE UNADORNED FASHION THE EVENTS OF THE DAY IT HAS BEEN A NARROW THING FOR GRELL HE CONCLUDED EVEN NOW I FANCY WE SHALL GET HIM GREEN'S AS TENACIOUS AS A BULL DOG WHEN HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TAKE HOLD OF
FOYLE MOTIONED FOR THE DOOR TO BE SHUT SO YOU'RE THE CAB DRIVER WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE YOU HE SAID YOU'RE WILLIAM WHITE
WITH TOM'S ADDITIONAL WEIGHT ON IT INSTEAD OF BREAKING BEGAN TO SINK BUT TOM GRAY WAS OUT OF THE HOLE NOW HELPED BY THE WAGON HE SLIPPED EASILY ALONG THE HALF SUBMERGED ICE
NOTHING BUT THE GREAT ICE HOUSE THAT STOOD LIKE A LONELY SENTINEL ON THE BANK YET SOMETHING SEEMED TO TELL HER THAT HELP LAY IN THAT DIRECTION ONCE BEFORE IN A MOMENT OF DANGER GRACE HAD OBEYED THIS SAME IMPULSE AND HAD NEVER REGRETTED IT
WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEP IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS SIR HILARY STRODE TO AND FRO ACROSS THE ROOM IT'S TIME WE GOT A BIT FORWARD HE SAID
BUT THE GAME COULD NOT LAST FOREVER THAT WAS CERTAIN A MONTH OR TWO MORE AND BEVERLY WOULD HAVE TO THINK OF THE RETURN TO WASHINGTON HIS COURAGE HIS COOL IMPUDENCE HIS SUBTLE WIT CHARMED HER MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO STUDY HIM FROM A STANDPOINT PECULIARLY AND SELFISHLY HER OWN
WITH THE DENOUEMENT THAT SAVED THE PRINCESS AND WON FOR THE GALLANT AMERICAN THE DESIRE OF HIS HEART WHAT A BRAVE FELLOW HE WAS CRIED BEVERLY WHO NEVER TIRED OF HEARING THE ROMANTIC STORY
REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE HE WHISPERED HOARSELY NO HARM MUST COME TO THEM
ONCE AGAIN SHE WAS FOLLOWING THE INSTINCT THAT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO ANOTHER PERSON ANYTHING BUT WISE SKATING AS SHE HAD NEVER SKATED BEFORE GRACE HARLOWE REACHED THE SHORE IN A MOMENT HERE DROPPING TO THE BANK SHE QUICKLY REMOVED HER SKATES
WHEN LORRY CAME DOWN TO SURRENDER HIMSELF IN ORDER TO SHIELD THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND QUINNOX HIMSELF PILOTED HIM THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE CASTLE THEN CAME THE EXCITING SCENE IN WHICH LORRY PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A PRISONER
GRACE ANXIOUSLY SCANNED THE EXPANSE OF THE ICE IT WAS NEARLY A MILE TO THE OTHER END OF THE POND AND THE LAST GROUP OF SKATERS HAD DISAPPEARED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO KINGSTON GREEN IT'S A HOT SCENT THERE YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBERS OF THE NOTES THAT MAXWELL GOT FROM THE BANK FIND OUT IF ANY OF THEM WERE CHANGED AT THE TAILOR'S THEY'VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS TO BLIND THE TRAIL WHAT I THINK HAPPENED IS THAT SHE TELEPHONED FROM THE GENERAL POST OFFICE TO SOME MOTOR CAR FIRM
BESIDES HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE LOVE TO ME
YETIVE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT BEVERLY AND THEN AT BALDOS AS IF TO ENQUIRE WHETHER THESE MEN WERE THE GOAT HUNTERS SHE HAD COME TO KNOW BY WORD OF MOUTH THE TWO FACES WERE HOPELESSLY NON COMMITTAL SUDDENLY BALDOS'S HORSE REARED AND BEGAN TO PLUNGE AS IF IN TERROR
THERE'S A WEEK YET ANSWERED FOYLE I DON'T THINK IT WILL MUCH MATTER WHAT IS REVEALED THEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CAME TO A HALT YOU'RE NOT A MAN TO BE OVER CONFIDENT FOYLE HE EXPLAINED DO YOU FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN OF HAVING GRELL UNDER ARREST BY THAT TIME I'VE NOT INTERFERED WITH YOU HITHERTO BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BE CAREFUL
SO THAT THE RIDER KEPT HIS SEAT ONLY BY MEANS OF ADEPT HORSEMANSHIP RAVONE LEAPED FORWARD AND AT THE RISK OF INJURY CLUTCHED THE PLUNGING STEED BY THE BIT TOGETHER THEY PARTIALLY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND BALDOS SWUNG TO THE GROUND AT RAVONE'S SIDE
I THOUGHT IT WAS A QUEER GO BUT IT WASN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS AND LADIES TAKE QUEER FANCIES AT TIMES SHE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING TO HIM THAT I COULD HEAR BUT JUST LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND BECKONED HE JUMPED IN AND OFF WE WENT WE STOPPED AT A TAILOR'S SHOP IN KINGSTON AND THE MAN WENT IN WHILE THE LADY STAYED IN THE CAB WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE SHOP
FOR A WEEK OR MORE BEVERLY HAD BEEN BEHAVING TOWARD BALDOS IN THE MOST CAVALIER FASHION HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TEASING HER AND TO HER OWN INTENSE AMAZEMENT SHE RESENTED IT THE FACT THAT SHE FELT THE STING OF THEIR SLY TAUNTS WAS SUFFICIENT TO AROUSE IN HER THE DISTRESSING CONVICTION
I FOUGHT HIM TO KEEP HIM FROM SURRENDERING HE BEAT ME AND I WAS VIRTUALLY HIS PRISONER WHEN WE APPEARED BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL IT'S NO WONDER SHE LOVED HIM AND MARRIED HIM HE DESERVED THE BEST THAT LIFE COULD GIVE MISS CALHOUN
SOMETHING OF THE KIND ADMITTED FOYLE WITH A SMILE AND BEFORE HE COULD BE QUESTIONED FURTHER HAD VANISHED HE HAD SAID NOTHING OF THE BLOTTING PAPER INCIDENT FOR THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE WISHED TO KEEP HIS OWN COUNSEL EVEN WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF SCOTLAND YARD ITSELF HE DID NOT WISH TO PIN HIMSELF DOWN UNTIL HE WAS SURE
ON A DAY SOON AFTER THE RETURN OF LORRY AND ANGUISH FROM A TRIP TO THE FRONTIER BEVERLY EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO VISIT THE MONASTERY OF SAINT VALENTINE HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP IT WAS A LONG RIDE OVER THE CIRCUITOUS ROUTE BY WHICH THE STEEP INCLINE WAS AVOIDED
I SHOULD CALL HIM DUTCH FRED OH I WAS WANDERING SEND HIM IN THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF THE CRIMINAL ABOUT FREDDY AS HE SWAGGERED INTO THE ROOM BEARING A GLOSSY SILK HAT OF THE LATEST FASHIONABLE SHAPE ON ONE ARM HIS MORNING COAT WAS OF FAULTLESS CUT HIS TROUSERS WERE CREASED WITH PRECISION
THEN SHE ROSE DRESSED AND APPEARED AT THE SUPPER TABLE APPARENTLY NONE THE WORSE FOR HER WETTING MEANWHILE TOM GRAY HAD GONE TO HIS AUNT'S GIVEN HIMSELF A BRISK RUBBING DOWN
A HURT EXPRESSION CROSSED HIS FACE NO MISTER FOYLE HE DECLARED EARNESTLY I DON'T TAKE ANY INTEREST IN BOXING I JUST CALLED IN TO PUT YOU WISE TO SOMETHING AS I WAS PASSING THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU FREDDY WHAT WAS IT THE PICK POCKET DROPPED HIS VOICE IT'S ABOUT HARRY GOLDENBURG HE SAID
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ICE HOUSE SHE CAME ABRUPTLY UPON A MAN ENGAGED IN LOADING A CHILD'S WAGON WITH CHIPS OF WOOD HELP CRIED GRACE HELP SOME PEOPLE HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE ICE HAVE YOU A ROPE THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHATEVER HE DID NOT EVEN LOOK UP UNTIL GRACE SHOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER
GREY SPATS COVERED HIS WELL SHONE BOOTS FOYLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND HIS BLUE EYES TWINKLED HUMOROUSLY ON THE WAR PATH I SEE FREDDY SIT DOWN WHAT'S THE GAME GOING TO THE BIG FIGHT THE LAST REMARK WAS MADE WITH AN OBJECT PROFESSIONAL BOXING ATTRACTS PERHAPS A LARGER NUMBER OF THE CRIMINAL FRATERNITY THAN ANY OTHER SPORT
THERE WERE OTHER CHANGES SUGGESTED FOR IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION AND THEN THERE WAS A GENERAL PLAN FOR THE MODERNIZING OF THE FORTRESS AT SOME MORE CONVENIENT TIME BALDOS LACONICALLY OBSERVED THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE OFFICIALS HE WAS ABLE TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY OF FORTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD
FRED TREVELYAN WHO IS HE HE ASKED MECHANICALLY HIS BRAIN STILL STRIVING WITH THE PROBLEM HE WISHED TO ELUCIDATE
I SAW HIM TO DAY FOYLE BEAT A TATTOO ON HIS DESK WITH HIS FINGERS THAT SO HE SAID LISTLESSLY OUT ON THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD I SUPPOSE DUTCH FRED SAT UP WITH A START YES HE AGREED JUST OUTSIDE KINGSTON HOW DID YOU KNOW JUST A GUESS LAUGHED THE SUPERINTENDENT
ALL RIGHT WHITE THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ALARMED ABOUT YOU PICKED UP A LADY OUTSIDE THE METROPOLITAN AND PROVINCIAL BANK THIS MORNING JUST SIT DOWN AND TELL US WHERE YOU TOOK HER
AND GET THE NUMBER VERIFIED IF YOU PHONE ME WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW THINGS STAND GREEN HAD HIS HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR BUT SUDDENLY SOMETHING OCCURRED TO HIM DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONE WITH HIM SIR HELDON FOYLE MADE A LITTLE GESTURE OF DISSENT
THEN RAN TOWARD THE ICE HOUSE FEELING STRANGELY UNACCUSTOMED TO WALKING ON THE GROUND AFTER HER LONG MORNING ON SKATES
IT WAS TIME THOUGHT SHE RESENTFULLY THAT HIS TEMERITY SHOULD MEET SOME SORT OF CHECK AND MOREOVER SHE HAD DREAMED OF HIM TWO NIGHTS IN SUCCESSION HOW WELL HER PLAN SUCCEEDED MAY BEST BE ILLUSTRATED BY SAYING THAT SHE NOW WAS IN A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE FRAME OF MIND
WHO HAD CERTAINLY BEEN BRAVE AND PATIENT DURING THE ORDEAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD UTTERED THE MOST FEARFUL SOUNDS AS SOON AS HIS FEET TOUCHED THE SOLID ICE HE SEIZED HIS WAGON AND MADE FOR THE BANK
WITH HIS LEFT HAND RUBBING VIGOROUSLY AT HIS CHIN WHITE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SIR I WENT AWAY AND HAD A BIT OF GRUB BEFORE COMING BACK AS I PASSED KINGSTON RAILWAY STATION I SAW THE LADY STANDING BY A BIG MOTOR CAR TALKING TO THE MAN SEATED AT THE WHEEL
PERHAPS HE HAD UNDERSTOOD SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT HER QUICK EYE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LONG THIN PLANK ON THE SHORE PULLING OFF ONE OF HER MITTENS SHE SHOWED HIM A LITTLE PEARL AND TURQUOISE RING HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
SOME DAY YOU MAY LEARN MORE ABOUT ME SHE SAID TO HIM I SINCERELY TRUST THAT I MAY MADAM SAID HE AND I'LL BET MY HAT HE WAS ENJOYING IT BETTER THAN EITHER OF US OF COURSE HE KNOWS YETIVE IS THE PRINCESS IT'S HIS INTENTION TO SERVE BEVERLY CALHOUN AND HE COULDN'T DO IT IF HE WERE TO CONFESS THAT HE KNOWS THE TRUTH
NOW DENUDED OF SKATERS THEN SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION LOOKING FOR TOM AND JULIA SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED WHEN SHE SAW HER FRIEND GO WHIZZING ACROSS THE ICE THAT HE HAD NOT CAUGHT THE RECKLESS GIRL IN TIME TO WARN HER OF HER DANGER
HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT DARNED OLD FORT SAID ANGUISH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH THINGS PROVES CONCLUSIVELY THAT HE IS NO ORDINARY PERSON YETIVE HAD A BIT OF A TALK WITH HIM JUST NOW SAID LORRY WITH A REFLECTIVE SMILE SHE ASKED HIM POINT BLANK IF HE KNEW WHO SHE WAS HE DID NOT HESITATE A SECOND
AND EVEN FROM DANGLOSS SHE WAS PROUD VASTLY PROUD OF HIM IN THESE DAYS THE IRON COUNT ALONE DISCREDITED THE ABILITY AND THE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS OF THE MOUNTEBANK AS HE NAMED THE MAN WHO HAD PUT HIS NOSE OUT OF JOINT BEVERLY SEEING MUCH OF MARLANX MADE THE MISTAKE OF CHIDING HIM FRANKLY AND GAILY ABOUT THIS AVERSION
MISS CALHOUN'S HORSE IN THE MEANTIME HAD CAUGHT THE FEVER HE PRANCED OFF TO THE ROADSIDE BEFORE SHE COULD GET HIM UNDER CONTROL SHE WAS THUS IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THE TWO MEN ON THE GROUND SHIELDED FROM VIEW BY THE BODY OF THE HORSE THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE TRICK BALDOS HAD CLEVERLY WORKED
EXCEPT POSSIBLY HORSE RACING IN MANY CASES IT IS PURELY AND SIMPLY LOVE OF THE GAME THAT ATTRACTS THERE IS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE BUT IN THE CASE OF FREDDY AND MEN IN HIS LINE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF COMBINING PLEASURE WITH PROFIT THE HINT WAS NOT LOST ON THE PICK POCKET
DO QUINNOX I AM MOST CURIOUS BEVERLY SAT VERY STILL AND TENSE
HE HAD PROMISED TO CALL ON LADY EILEEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK AND HIS MIND DWELT ON THE POTENTIALITIES OF THE INTERVIEW AS HE LINGERED OVER HIS FRUGAL MEAL HE HAD JUST POURED OUT HIS SECOND CUP WHEN THE TELEPHONE BUZZER BEHIND HIM JARRED A CALL FROM LIVERPOOL SIR SAID THE MAN IN THE PRIVATE EXCHANGE MISTER BLAKE WANTS YOU
HE CAME AT LAST WONDER AND A LITTLE ALARM IN HIS FACE AS HE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE SUPERINTENDENT AND GREEN SAT THERE ARE MANY RULES THE INFRINGEMENT OF WHICH WILL IMPERIL A LICENCE
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK IN OUR TRADE I REMEMBER A CASE OF FORGERY ONCE
WHERE RECENTLY SHE HAD SUNG HIS PRAISES TO YETIVE AND OTHERS SHE NOW WAS STRANGELY RETICENT
REVEALING A WIDE AND THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND EXTENSIVE INSPECTION HE HAD SEEN AMERICAN AS WELL AS EUROPEAN FORTIFICATIONS THE GRAUSTARK ENGINEERS WENT TO WORK AT ONCE TO PERFECT THE SIMPLE CHANGES HE ADVISED LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED TO STRENGTHEN THE PLACE BEFORE AN ATTACK COULD BE MADE
I COULDN'T SEE THE NUMBER FOR DUST IT WAS A SOMETHING WELL WE KNOW ALL THAT SAID FOYLE ALL THE SAME FREDDY I AM GLAD YOU DROPPED IN I WON'T FORGET IT RIGHT OH MISTER FOYLE GOOD EVENING AND THE PICK POCKET SWAGGERED OUT WHILE FOYLE THOUGHTFULLY STOWED AWAY HIS PAPERS
BALDOS REFUSED TO BE PROPERLY DEPRESSED BY HIS MISFORTUNE HE RETIRED TO THE OBLIVION SHE PROVIDED AND SEEMED DISAGREEABLY CONTENT APPARENTLY IT MADE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER HE WAS IN OR OUT OF FAVOR BEVERLY WAS IN HIGH DUDGEON AND LOW SPIRITS
IN BROKEN JERKY SENTENCES RAVONE EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL THAT THEY WERE A PARTY OF ACTORS ON THEIR WAY TO EDELWEISS BUT THAT THEY HAD BEEN ADVISED TO GIVE THE PLACE A WIDE BERTH NOW THEY WERE MAKING THE BEST OF A HARD JOURNEY TO SERROS WHERE THEY EXPECTED BUT LITTLE BETTER SUCCESS
HURRIED AFTER HIM BUT SHE WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND COULD NOT RUN BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE BANK HE HAD ROUNDED THE CORNER OF THE ICE HOUSE AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT
YES SIR I DID PICK UP A LADY THERE I TOOK HER ALONG TO THE GENERAL POST OFFICE AND WAITED WHILE SHE WENT IN THEN WAIT A MINUTE INTERRUPTED FOYLE HOW LONG WAS SHE IN THERE TEN MINUTES AS NEAR AS A TOUCH ACCORDING TO THE WAY THE TAXIMETER JUMPED WHILE I WAS WAITING
BEVERLY AND QUINNOX CAME UP WITH THEM AND FOUND ALL EYES CENTERED ON A SMALL COMPANY OF MEN
WELL OFF I WENT TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THAT THE BOY WAS ATTENDING AND HAD A TALK WITH ONE OF THE MASTERS
A BIG BROWN THING WITH AN OPEN BODY RIGHT YOU ARE WHITE SAID FOYLE WITH A NOD OF DISMISSAL THAT WILL DO FOR NOW YOU GO DOWN AND WAIT IN THE YARD WITH YOUR CAB AND WE'LL GET SOME ONE TO GO WITH YOU TO KINGSTON AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THE MAN HIS EYES MET THOSE OF THE CHIEF DETECTIVE INSPECTOR
YOU'RE TALKING IN PARABLES LIKE A DETECTIVE OUT OF A BOOK SAID THORNTON WITH A PEEVISHNESS THAT HIS COVERING SMILE COULD NOT ENTIRELY CONCEAL BUT I KNOW YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO PRECISE HOW DO YOU REGARD THE BURNT PAPER IS IT IMPORTANT
ALTHOUGH HE BETRAYED HIMSELF BY NO WORD OR SIGN SHE WAS ENJOYING THE FUN OF IT TOO INTENSELY TO EXPOSE IT TO THE RISK OF DESTRUCTION BY REVEALING HER TRUE IDENTITY TO HIM LOGICALLY THAT WOULD MEAN THE END OF EVERYTHING NO DOUBT HE FELT THE SAME AND KEPT HIS COUNSEL
CHARGED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF PRINCE LORENZ THEN BETROTHED TO THE PRINCESS LAY HIDDEN IN THE MONASTERY WHILE YETIVE'S OWN SOLDIERS HUNTED HIGH AND LOW FOR HIM THE NARRATOR DWELT GLOWINGLY UPON THE TRIP FROM THE MONASTERY TO THE CITY WALLS ONE DARK NIGHT
WHILE SHE CALLED WILDLY FOR HELP AND HEAPED GRACE WITH REPROACHES FOR RUNNING AWAY IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WOULD BE THE ACT OF A COWARD EXCLAIMED TOM AT LAST HIS TEETH CHATTERING WITH COLD I WOULD LET GO OF YOUR ARM AND GIVE UP THE JOB OF SUPPORTING YOU IN THIS ICE WATER FOR TALKING ABOUT GRACE LIKE THAT
TOOK TO RIDING WITH HER HIGH SPIRITED YOUNG GUEST ON MANY A LITTLE JAUNT TO THE HILLS SHE USUALLY RODE WITH LORRY OR ANGUISH CHEERFULLY ASSUMING THE SUBDUED POSITION BEFITTING A LADY IN WAITING APPARENTLY RESTORED TO FAVOR ON PROBATION SHE ENJOYED BEVERLY'S UNIQUE POSITION
CALLING TO THE ESCORT TO FOLLOW THE KEEN EYES OF THE GUARD CAUGHT THE SITUATION AT ONCE MISS CALHOUN SHOT A QUICK GLANCE AT HIM AS HE RODE UP BESIDE HER HIS FACE WAS IMPASSIVE BUT SHE COULD SEE HIS HAND CLENCH THE BRIDLE REIN AND THERE WAS AN AIR OF RESTRAINT IN HIS WHOLE BEARING
KEPT HER BALANCE ADMIRABLY BY MEANS OF THE OTHER END OF THE PLANK TOM AND JULIA CROSBY HAD NOW BEEN NEARLY TEN MINUTES IN THE WATER TWICE THE ICE HAD BROKEN UNDER TOM'S GRASP WHILE JULIA WHO SEEMED UNABLE TO HELP HERSELF HAD THROWN ALL HER WEIGHT ON THE POOR BOY
INDICATING THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM IF HE WOULD HELP HER THEN SHE SEIZED ONE END OF THE PLANK AND MADE A SIGN FOR HIM TO TAKE THE OTHER BUT THE STUBBORN CREATURE BEGAN TO UNLOAD THE CHIPS FROM THE WAGON GRACE RAN BLINDLY AHEAD DRAGGING THE PLANK ALONE HE'S FEEBLE MINDED SHE QUIVERED
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE PARAGON TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU DEAR IF HE THINKS YOU ARE ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE YETIVE ASKED HER BLUE EYES BEAMING WITH THE FUN OF IT ALL POOH SNIFFED BEVERLY YOU HAVE ONLY TO CONSULT HISTORY TO FIND THE EXCUSE IT'S THE DEAR OLD HABIT OF MEN TO MAKE LOVE TO QUEENS AND GET BEHEADED FOR IT
WELL WHAT ABOUT IT DID YOU SPEAK TO HIM I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE RETORTED FREDDY I WAS IN A LITTLE RUN ABOUT WITH A PAL WHEN HE CAME SCOOTING BY HELL FOR LEATHER WE ONLY GOT A GLIMPSE OF HIM AND IF HE NOTICED US HE MADE NO SIGN I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT'S ALL IT WAS AN OPEN CAR BROWN COLOUR
ARE YOU DEAF HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STUPIDLY TOUCHING HIS EARS AND MOUTH DEAF AND DUMB SHE EXCLAIMED IN DESPAIR HOLDING UP TWO FINGERS GRACE POINTED TOWARD THE WATER THEN SHE MADE A SWIMMING MOTION
JULIA CROSBY SAID NOT A WORD DURING THE WALK BUT WHEN SHE LEFT THEM AT THE CORNER WHERE SHE TURNED INTO HER OWN STREET SHE SAID HUSKILY THANK YOU BOTH FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ME TO DAY I OWE MY LIFE TO YOU THAT WAS A WHOLE LOT FOR HER TO SAY SAID GRACE
A TOUCH OF THE OLD JAUNTINESS CROPPED OUT HERE AND THERE A TINGE OF THE OLD IRONY MARRED HIS OTHERWISE PERFECT MIEN AS A SOLDIER HIS LAUGH WAS FREER HIS EYES LESS UNDER SUBJUGATION HIS ENTIRE PERSONALITY MORE ARROGANT
SHALL I PUT HIM THROUGH A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED BEFORE FOYLE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUTWITTED BY THE PRINCESS PETROVSKA IS THAT MISTER FOYLE THIS IS BLAKE SPEAKING WE'VE GOT ON THE TRACK OF THE LADY AGAIN SHE'D BEEN STAYING AT A BOARDING HOUSE PRETENDING SHE WAS A MEMBER OF A THEATRICAL COMPANY
HE LIFTED THE PLANK AND RESTED IT ON THE WAGON THEN MOTIONING HER TO HOLD UP THE BACK END HE STARTED ON A RUN DOWN THE BANK THE POOR SOUL THINKS HE'S A HORSE I SUPPOSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF WE CAN ONLY GET THE PLANK TO TOM AND JULIA
SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ONE THERE SHE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN ON FASTER THAN BEFORE I SHALL FIND HELP OVER THERE I KNOW I SHALL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE HURRIED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE HOUSE THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
BEVERLY DISTINCTLY SAW THE GUARD AND THE BEGGAR EXCHANGE BITS OF PAPER WITH GLANCES THAT MEANT MORE THAN THE WORDS THEY WERE UNABLE TO UTTER BALDOS PRESSED INTO RAVONE'S HAND A NOTE OF SOME BULK AND RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE A MERE SLIP OF PAPER
TOM AND JULIA WERE LIABLE TO BE SUCKED UNDER AND DROWNED WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HELP GRACE PUSHED RESOLUTELY ON IN THE MEANTIME HARDLY FOUR MINUTES HAD REALLY ELAPSED SINCE THE SKATERS HAD TUMBLED INTO THE WATER
I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP UP MUCH LONGER EXCLAIMED JULIA BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN KEEP ON CRYING REPLIED TOM EXASPERATED IT WILL WARM YOU AND REMEMBER THAT I AM DOING THE KEEPING UP I DON'T SEE THAT YOU ARE MAKING ANY SPECIAL EFFORT IN THAT DIRECTION
RUSHED OFF TO FIND DAVID HIPPY AND REDDY AND TELL THEM THE NEWS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION FOR GRACE SHE IS THE FINEST MOST RESOLUTE GIRL I EVER KNEW HE EXCLAIMED AS HE FINISHED HIS STORY HURRAH FOR GRACE HARLOWE SHOUTED REDDY LET'S GO DOWN TO NIGHT AND SEE IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT SUGGESTED DAVID
ONCE TOM HAD ENDEAVORED TO LIFT JULIA OUT OF THE HOLE AND HE BELIEVED AND ALWAYS INSISTED IN TELLING THE STORY AFTERWARDS THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TO HELP HERSELF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BUT JULIA CROSBY TRIUMPHANT LEADER OF HER CLASS AND JULIA CROSBY COLD AND WET AS A RESULT OF HER OWN RECKLESSNESS
SHE EVEN ARGUED THE GUARD'S CASE BEFORE THE HEAD OF THE ARMY IMPRUDENTLY POINTING OUT MANY OF HIS SUPERIOR QUALITIES IN ADVOCATING HIS CAUSE THE COUNT WAS LEARNING FORBEARANCE IN HIS OLD AGE HE SAW THE WISDOM OF PROCRASTINATION BALDOS WAS IN FAVOR BUT SOMEDAY THERE WOULD COME A TIME FOR HIS UNDOING
I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO WORK THIS THING BY MYSELF WHEN SHE HAD REACHED THE BANK GRACE HEARD HIM TROTTING BEHIND HER WITH HIS LITTLE WAGON IN ANOTHER MOMENT THERE WAS A TUG AT THE BOARD SHE TURNED AND SHOOK HER FIST ANGRILY AT HIM BUT WITHOUT REGARDING HER IN THE LEAST
IN THE BARRACKS HE WAS ACQUIRING FAME REPORTS WENT FORTH WITH UNBIASED FREEDOM HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS THE BEST SWORDSMAN IN THE SERVICE AS WELL AS THE MOST EFFICIENT MARKSMAN WITH THE FOILS AND SABERS HE EASILY VANQUISHED THE FOREMOST FENCERS IN HIGH AND LOW CIRCLES
HE'S NO FOOL BALDOS WAS NOT LONG IN PREPARING PLANS FOR THE CHANGES IN THE FORTRESS THEY EMBODIED A TEMPORARY READJUSTMENT OF THE ARMAMENT AND ALTERATIONS IN THE AMMUNITION HOUSE THE GATE LEADING TO THE RIVER WAS CLOSED AND THE REFUSE FROM THE FORT WAS TAKEN TO THE BARGES BY WAY OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE
THAT HE HAD BECOME IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROVE EMBARRASSING WHILE CONFESSING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS A BIT TREACHEROUS AND WEAK SHE PROCEEDED TO IGNORE BALDOS WITH ASTONISHING PERSISTENCY APART FROM THE TEASING IT SEEMED TO HER OF LATE THAT HE WAS GROWING A SHADE TOO CONFIDENT
POINTING TO HIS WET CLOTHES I BELIEVE SHE WILL BE SAID GRACE SOFTLY AFTER ALL IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO ONE GOOD
VERY WELL GO ON SAID FOYLE CURTLY WELL IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT COMES THE CHAP AGAIN AND SPOKE TO THE LADY SHE GOT OUT AND PAID ME OFF HE WENT BACK INTO THE SHOP AND SHE WALKED AWAY DOWN THE STREET AND THAT'S THE LAST YOU SAW OF THEM I SUPPOSE ASKED THE SUPERINTENDENT
BY JOVE I LIKE THAT FELLOW'S COOLNESS SAID LORRY TO HARRY ANGUISH AFTER THE MEETING HE'S AFTER MY OWN HEART WHY HE TREATS US AS THOUGH WE WERE THE SUPPLIANTS HE THE ALMS GIVER HE IS PLAYING A GAME I'LL ADMIT BUT HE DOES IT WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT DELIGHTS ME
QUICKLY UNTWISTING A LONG MUFFLER OF RED SILK FROM ABOUT HER NECK GRACE TIED IT SECURELY IN THE MIDDLE AROUND THE CROSS PIECE OF THE TONGUE OF THE STOUT LITTLE VEHICLE THEN SHE PUSHED IT GENTLY UNTIL IT STOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE GIVING ONE END OF THE MUFFLER TO JULIA GRACE TOOK THE OTHER HERSELF
WHEN GREEN HAD GONE FOYLE GAVE A FEW INSTRUCTIONS TO COVER THE POINTS THAT HAD ARISEN AND WALKED TO SIR HILARY THORNTON'S ROOM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKED UP AND PROFFERED A CIGAR THINK OF THE ANGELS HE SAID I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THINGS WERE GOING
OF COURSE SHE HAS GONE FOR HELP HAVEN'T YOU FOUND OUT LONG AGO THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT SORT WELL WHY DID SHE GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SOBBED JULIA EVERYBODY IS OVER ON THE OTHER BANK THERE IS NOTHING BUT AN ICE HOUSE OVER HERE YOU MAY TRUST TO HER TO HAVE HAD SOME GOOD SENSIBLE REASON RETORTED TOM LOYALLY
WE HAD BETTER GET HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR WE'LL ALL BE LAID UP WITH COLDS THE THREE HALF FROZEN YOUNG PEOPLE MADE THEIR WAY HOME AS BEST THEY COULD THEIR CLOTHES HAD FROZEN STIFF MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HURRY
AND SOON SPIES BEGAN TO COME TO THE GOVERNOR WITH TALES AND FABRICATIONS OF THE CRIMES THAT SHE HAD BEEN COMMITTING IN THEIR EYES THEY BORE WITNESS THAT SHE HAD GIVEN AN OVERCOAT TO A FRENCHMAN WHO WAS COLD AND HUNGRY AND THE FRENCHMAN LATER ESCAPED OVER THE DUTCH FRONTIER
HE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SECURE HER PARDON OR AT LEAST A MODERATION OF THE PUNISHMENT HE WROTE TO BARON VON DER LANCKEN POINTING OUT IN A CLEAR AND DECISIVE MANNER THAT MISS CAVELL HAD SERVED THE GERMANS BY CARING FOR THEIR WOUNDED
FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
AND THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN INFLICTED FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO THE BARON WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR BARON I AM TOO ILL TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON
ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
MISS CAVELL DESIRED TO CONTINUE HER HOSPITAL WORK AND WENT TO THE GOVERNOR VON BISSING TO GET PERMISSION TO DO SO HE GRANTED IT FOR THE QUIET ENGLISH NURSE MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON HIM WE ARE TOLD THAT THE ARROGANT GERMAN FORMED A HIGH OPINION OF HER
IN BRIEF THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IS AS FOLLOWS THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE OF WHICH MISS CAVELL WAS ACCUSED THEY HAD KEPT HER IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND PREVENTED HER FROM CONSULTING AN ADVOCATE UP TO THE TIME OF HER TRIAL
AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMERICAN LEGATION SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED NONE AT SIX TWENTY IN THE EVENING THEY WERE TOLD BY A SUBORDINATE THAT THE SENTENCE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN
WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED MISS CAVELL LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING BACK TO BRUSSELS BELIEVING THAT HER DUTY CALLED HER THERE SHE WROTE A LETTER COMMENTING ON THE GERMAN ARMY WHEN IT SWEPT THROUGH BELGIUM AND IN IT SHE VOICED HER PITY FOR THE TIRED FOOTSORE GERMAN SOLDIERS
HER HOME SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT THREE YEARS AFTER ITS COMMENCEMENT MISS CAVELL STARTED ALSO A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES SHE WAS POPULAR EVERYWHERE IN THE BELGIAN CAPITAL
NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
ONE THING HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THOSE PRETTY VIVIDLY THE CONFOUNDED PUP THE ONLOOKER HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONGER THAN YOU HAVE DONE MY GOOD READER AND HE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET A GIANT TEMPTATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL BUT THE GRATING OF HIS FEET AS HE SET THEM ON THE STONES AND THE MOVEMENT NOW AND THEN OF A BIRD IN THE IVY THEN CAME A RUSTLE A GRITTY CLATTER LOUD FALLING STONES HIS FOOT HAD SLIPPED AND HE HAD FALLEN
THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
WAS CALM DIGNIFIED AND BRAVE AT THE TRIAL AND FACED HER ACCUSERS HEROICALLY SHE WAS DRESSED IN HER NURSE'S UNIFORM AND WORE THE BADGE OF THE RED CROSS WHEN MISTER WHITLOCK LEARNED THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH
HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
SHE STUDIED AT THE LONDON HOSPITAL A PLACE WE ARE TOLD WHERE THE HARDEST AND MOST DIFFICULT CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND WHERE THE NURSES WERE WORKED TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR STRENGTH SHE ALSO HELD THE POSITION OF A NURSE IN TWO OTHER HOSPITALS
HER FATHER WAS AN ENGLISH MINISTER OF THE OLD SCHOOL WHO WAS RECTOR OF A SINGLE PARISH IN NORWICH FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY EDITH AND HER SISTER WERE BROUGHT UP IN STRICT CONFORMANCE WITH CHURCH IDEAS
DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
SO MUCH SO THAT HE SECRETLY DETERMINED TO KEEP HER UNDER THE STRICTEST SUPERVISION FROM THAT TIME ON SPIES DOGGED HER TRACKS SHE CARED FOR THE WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIERS AND NURSED A NUMBER OF GERMAN OFFICERS AS WELL AS THE BELGIANS WHO WERE IN HER CARE
WHEN HER DEATH BECAME KNOWN THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED IN ENGLAND THIS MURDER DID MORE TO STIMULATE RECRUITING THAN ANYTHING ELSE UP TO THAT TIME ALL DAY LONG LINES OF MEN WAITED TO SIGN THE PAPERS OF ENLISTMENT
SILVERED AND PEARLED ON EVERY SCENTED STILL SPRAY THE SKY WAS DEEP CLEAR STRONG BLUE ABOVE AND AGAINST THE BLUE THE WALLFLOWERS SHONE BRAVELY FROM THE CRACKS AND CREVICES OF RUINED ARCH AND WALL AND BUTTRESS
BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
AND WERE TAUGHT THE VALUE OF LEADING USEFUL LIVES AND THE GLORY OF SELF SACRIFICE AS WAS CUSTOMARY AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL SHE RECEIVED HER EDUCATION ON THE CONTINENT ATTENDING SCHOOL IN THE CITY OF BRUSSELS IN BELGIUM
WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
BUT HER MOTHER WAS CLOSE TO HER HEART AND SHE SAW HER AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD I MAY BE LOOKED ON AS AN OLD MAID SHE IS REPORTED AS SAYING BUT WITH MY WORK AND MY MOTHER I AM A VERY HAPPY ONE AND DESIRE NOTHING MORE AS LONG AS I HAVE THESE TWO
THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
DO YOU WANT SOME HE SAID AND ON THE INSTANT HIS HAND HAD FOUND A STRONG JUTTING STONE HIS FOOT A FIRM LEDGE AND SHE SAW HIS FIGURE GREY FLANNEL AGAINST GREY STONE GO UP THE WALL TOWARDS THE YELLOW FLOWERS
I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
WILL GO DOWN INTO HISTORY WITH THE LUSTRE OF GLORY AND SELF SACRIFICE SURROUNDING IT THAT NAME IS EDITH CAVELL EDITH CAVELL WAS BORN AT SWARDESTON IN NORWICH ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WE ARE TOLD MISS CAVELL WAS TYING UP THE WOUNDS OF A WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIER WHEN A GROUP OF ARMED MEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND THEIR LEADER TOLD HER ROUGHLY THAT SHE WAS UNDER ARREST
AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT
BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY
HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE EDITH CAVELL AS THE NAME OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE BECAME WORLD FAMOUS AT THE CLOSE OF THE CRIMEAN WAR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO THE NAME OF ANOTHER ENGLISH NURSE WHO SUFFERED MARTYRDOM IN THE WORLD WAR
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
TO MITIGATE THE SENTENCE AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING HE WAS TOLD THAT VON BISSING REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO SAVE MISS CAVELL'S LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR DENIED THIS APPEAL EDITH CAVELL WAS ALLOWED TO SEE A BRITISH CHAPLAIN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF DEATH
SHE SAID WHY YOU WANT ME MORE THAN EVER BUT I MAY DIE AT ANY MOMENT SO MAY I AND YOU MAY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCE
HE NEVER INFORMED THEM THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED HE NEVER CAME TO SEE THEM AFTERWARD AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION AND FOR ASSISTANCE HE HAD DISAPPEARED MISS CAVELL WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
THE SHOREDITCH INFIRMARY IN HOXTON AND THE SAINT PANCRAS INFIRMARY AND SHE GAINED A REPUTATION BOTH FOR HARD WORK AND EFFICIENCY WHILE HER PATIENTS OFTEN SPOKE OF HER GENTLENESS AND HER KINDNESS NOT CONTENT WITH FORGETTING A PATIENT WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL
AN AMERICAN LAWYER MISTER DE LEVAL WAS REQUESTED BY MISTER WHITLOCK TO TAKE MISS CAVELL'S CASE AND DO WHATEVER WAS POSSIBLE IN HER BEHALF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRISONER AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE UNTIL THE TRIAL BEGAN
A PICTURE TO WRING THE HEART OF THE ONLOOKER WITH ENVY OR SYMPATHY ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONLOOKER A MAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS WHO PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE AND TOOK IN THE FULL CHARM AND MEANING OF THE SCENE
CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
SHE THEN RETURNED TO HER HOME AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL WHEN TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND RESOLVED TO GIVE HER LIFE TO SOME USEFUL AND BENEVOLENT OCCUPATION SHE DECIDED TO BECOME A TRAINED NURSE AND WENT TO LONDON TO STUDY THAT CALLING
OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
AND AT FIRST THEY WERE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON MISS CAVELL AS AN UNTRAINED OUTSIDER BUT HER TACT EFFICIENCY AND SKILL SOON WON THE HEARTS OF THESE GOOD WOMEN WHO AFFORDED HER EVERY COURTESY AND ENTERED INTO CORDIAL COOPERATION WITH HER
SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
WHO WERE LATER TO SLAY HER BRUSSELS BECAME A PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE AND A TYRANNICAL GOVERNOR CAME THERE TO ESTABLISH HIS HEADQUARTERS ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS THREATENING THE BELGIANS WITH DEATH FOR MINOR OFFENSES AND FILLING BRUSSELS WITH SPIES AND INTRIGUE
THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
A BLOW WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE WHEN SHE TRIED TO EXPOSTULATE SHE WAS TAKEN TO PRISON AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HER ARREST WAS SHROUDED WITH THE MOST CAREFUL SECRECY FOR THE GERMANS DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NEUTRAL GOVERNMENTS
HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
AND CALLED ON HER FATHER TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION AND SET FORTH HIS PROSPECTS HIS COMING WAS HERALDED BY A LETTER FROM HER ONE MUST NOT QUOTE IT IT IS NOT PROPER TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY LETTERS TO A TRUSTED FATHER FROM A CHILD ONLY AND ADORED
THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
AND IN MISS CAVELL'S HOME TOWN EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN WAS SWORN INTO THE ARMY A BITTER DENUNCIATION OF THE GERMAN ACT WAS MADE BY SIR EDWARD GREY THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD ONLY A POOR EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
BUT I APPEAL TO YOUR GENEROSITY OF HEART TO SUPPORT IT AND SAVE THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN FROM DEATH HAVE PITY ON HER BRAND WHITLOCK
YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
IF HE DID THE LESS PRECISE AND DEVOTIONAL MAY PARDON HIM HE HAD LOVED THE GIRL SINCE HER EARLY TEENS AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY'S POST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE APPOINTMENT THAT ONE MIGHT MARRY ON THE APPOINTMENT HAD COME THROUGH HER FATHER
EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
HE WORE A LONG COAT AND LIKE KUTUZOV HAD A WHIP SLUNG ACROSS HIS SHOULDER MEANWHILE KUTUZOV HAD REACHED THE VILLAGE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE SHADE OF THE NEAREST HOUSE ON A BENCH
EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO EXPRESS HER SYMPATHY WITH HIS SORROW BUT PIERRE SAW BY HER FACE THAT SHE WAS GLAD BOTH AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I MUCH REGRET HER ILLNESS SAID PRINCE ANDREW AND HE SMILED LIKE HIS FATHER COLDLY MALICIOUSLY AND UNPLEASANTLY SO
TO PIERRE THAT SMILE SAID PLAINLY I AM WELL
BORIS DOESN'T WANT TO HELP ME AND I DON'T WANT TO ASK HIM
WHO WISHED TO HAVE A TETE A TETE WITH NATASHA MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND PERSISTENTLY TALKED ABOUT MOSCOW AMUSEMENTS AND THEATERS
MONSIEUR KURAGIN HAS NOT HONORED COUNTESS ROSTOVA WITH HIS HAND SAID PRINCE ANDREW AND HE SNORTED SEVERAL TIMES
THOSE HE WROTE ABOUT GERAKOV LECTURES FOR THE CORPS INDITING
HARDLY HAD ROSTOV HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND FINISHED EXPLAINING DENISOV'S CASE WHEN HASTY STEPS AND THE JINGLING OF SPURS WERE HEARD ON THE STAIRS
HALF IN JEST HALF IN EARNEST BUT NATASHA NOTICED THAT HER FATHER WAS FLURRIED ON ENTERING THE ANTEROOM AND INQUIRED TIMIDLY AND SOFTLY
YES THAT WOULD BE VERY NOBLE BUT I AM UNABLE TO FOLLOW IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FOOTSTEPS IF YOU WISH TO BE MY FRIEND NEVER SPEAK TO ME OF THAT
THE OLD PRINCE'S VOICE AND ANOTHER NOW AND THEN INTERRUPTED HIM PRINCESS MARY CAME OUT TO MEET PIERRE SHE SIGHED LOOKING TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WHERE PRINCE ANDREW WAS
PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHED DISAGREEABLY AGAIN REMINDING ONE OF HIS FATHER AND WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER IN LAW NOW IF I MAY ASK HE SAID
STILL GETTING STOUTER HE SAID WITH ANIMATION BUT THE NEW WRINKLE ON HIS FOREHEAD DEEPENED YES I AM WELL HE SAID IN ANSWER TO PIERRE'S QUESTION AND SMILED
AS IF I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT NATASHA
BUT I LIKE JUSTICE PIERRE NOW RECOGNIZED IN HIS FRIEND A NEED WITH WHICH HE WAS ONLY TOO FAMILIAR TO GET EXCITED AND TO HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT EXTRANEOUS MATTERS
SO YOU WANT TO SMELL GUNPOWDER HE SAID TO PIERRE
TELL HIM TO COME LATER HE'LL BE COMING OUT DIRECTLY WE MUST GO LATER LATER TOMORROW IT'S TOO LATE ROSTOV TURNED AND WAS ABOUT TO GO BUT THE MAN IN THE BRACES STOPPED HIM
HE HAS TAKEN IT BETTER FAR BETTER THAN I EXPECTED EVIDENTLY IT HAD TO BE BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL IS REALLY ENDED ASKED PIERRE PRINCESS MARY LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
KUTUZOV SMILINGLY NODDED HIS HEAD TO THE RHYTHM OF THE VERSES WHEN PIERRE HAD LEFT KUTUZOV DOLOKHOV CAME UP TO HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND
I AM VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU HERE COUNT HE SAID ALOUD REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS AND IN A PARTICULARLY RESOLUTE AND SOLEMN TONE ON THE EVE OF A DAY
HE DID IT ALL SILENTLY AND VERY QUICKLY HE STOOD UP AND COUGHED HIS FACE WAS GLOOMY AND HIS LIPS COMPRESSED FORGIVE ME FOR TROUBLING YOU
BORIS HAD CONTRIVED TO REMAIN AT HEADQUARTERS AFTER THE CHANGES HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
HE ENTERED THE PORCH OF THE EMPEROR'S HOUSE A BROAD STAIRCASE LED STRAIGHT UP FROM THE ENTRY
AGAIN THE CROWD OF MEMBERS OF THE SUITE AND STREET GAZERS AMONG WHOM WAS ROSTOV MOVED NEARER TO THE EMPEROR
HE WAS SAYING BUT ON SEEING ROSTOV HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED WHAT IS IT A PETITION WHAT IS IT ASKED THE PERSON IN THE OTHER ROOM ANOTHER PETITIONER ANSWERED THE MAN WITH THE BRACES
I COULDN'T BEGIN TALKING ABOUT HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FRENCHWOMAN
THE COUNT HAD DEVISED THIS DIPLOMATIC RUSE AS HE AFTERWARDS TOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO GIVE THE FUTURE SISTERS IN LAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER FREELY
ACCOMPANIED BY THE THRONG PIERRE STOPPED SOME THIRTY PACES FROM KUTUZOV TALKING TO BORIS HE EXPLAINED HIS WISH TO BE PRESENT AT THE BATTLE AND TO SEE THE POSITION
IN ORDER TO STIFLE THOUGHTS THAT WERE TOO OPPRESSIVE AND TOO INTIMATE WHEN PRINCE MESHCHERSKI HAD LEFT PRINCE ANDREW TOOK PIERRE'S ARM AND ASKED HIM INTO THE ROOM THAT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED HIM
HE HAD PROBABLY SOILED THEM WHEN HE TOO HAD KNELT BEFORE THE ICON CAME UP TO HIM SMILING BORIS WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED WITH A SLIGHTLY MARTIAL TOUCH APPROPRIATE TO A CAMPAIGN
AND FELT MORTIFIED BY IT SHE BLUSHED FOR HIM GREW STILL ANGRIER AT HAVING BLUSHED AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCESS WITH A BOLD AND DEFIANT EXPRESSION WHICH SAID
A BED HAD BEEN MADE UP THERE AND SOME OPEN PORTMANTEAUS AND TRUNKS STOOD ABOUT PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO ONE AND TOOK OUT A SMALL CASKET FROM WHICH HE DREW A PACKET WRAPPED IN PAPER
AND THE MONARCH MOUNTED AND RODE DOWN THE STREET AT A GALLOP BESIDE HIMSELF WITH ENTHUSIASM
BUT I DON'T KNOW SAID PIERRE WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID PRINCE ANDREW TELL COUNTESS ROSTOVA THAT SHE WAS AND IS PERFECTLY FREE
SAID TO PIERRE AS THOUGH CONTINUING AN INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION THE MILITIA HAVE PUT ON CLEAN WHITE SHIRTS TO BE READY TO DIE WHAT HEROISM COUNT
CONSIDERED YOUNG PRINCE DRUBETSKOY AN INVALUABLE MAN IN THE HIGHER COMMAND THERE WERE TWO SHARPLY DEFINED PARTIES KUTUZOV'S PARTY AND THAT OF BENNIGSEN THE CHIEF OF STAFF
PRINCESS MARY LOOKED FRIGHTENED THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OLD PRINCE IN A DRESSING GOWN AND A WHITE NIGHTCAP CAME IN AH MADAM HE BEGAN MADAM COUNTESS
PRINCE ANDREW'S WE SHALL PASS IT AND I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM WHAT ABOUT THE LEFT FLANK ASKED PIERRE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH BETWEEN OURSELVES
THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO MOVE HER TO THE COUNTRY AND SO THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN SENT FOR PIERRE SAW THE DISTRACTED COUNT AND SONYA WHO HAD A TEAR STAINED FACE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE NATASHA
BELOW UNDER THE STAIRCASE WAS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER FLOOR WHOM DO YOU WANT SOMEONE INQUIRED
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT STATE OUR LEFT FLANK IS IN SAID BORIS CONFIDENTIALLY LOWERING HIS VOICE IT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT COUNT BENNIGSEN INTENDED
PLEASE THINK OF ME PERHAPS I MAY PROVE USEFUL TO YOUR SERENE HIGHNESS YES YES KUTUZOV REPEATED HIS LAUGHING EYE NARROWING MORE AND MORE AS HE LOOKED AT PIERRE
THOUGHT ROSTOV WHO HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE ALEXANDER LODGED SADDLED HORSES WERE STANDING BEFORE THE HOUSE
I MAY SEE HIM AT ANY MOMENT THOUGHT ROSTOV IF ONLY I WERE TO HAND THE LETTER DIRECT TO HIM AND TELL HIM ALL
AND BY THOSE WHO WERE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIS AIMS TO JUDGE A MAN WHO IS IN DISFAVOR
AND HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLY TO ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW THAT WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM OR TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS TOLD HIM
THE FIRST PERSON WHO CAME TO MEET THE VISITORS WAS MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE SHE GREETED THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER WITH SPECIAL POLITENESS
THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPEROR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR AND ROSTOV ENTERED
AND AT EASE FROM THE FIRST GLANCE PRINCESS MARY DID NOT LIKE NATASHA SHE THOUGHT HER TOO FASHIONABLY DRESSED FRIVOLOUSLY GAY AND VAIN
SURELY NOT HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ON WHOSE SIDE JUSTICE LIES HE UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING KNOWS EVERYTHING WHO CAN BE MORE JUST MORE MAGNANIMOUS THAN HE
WHOM HE HAD TO PASS CURSING HIS TEMERITY HIS HEART SINKING AT THE THOUGHT OF FINDING HIMSELF AT ANY MOMENT FACE TO FACE WITH THE EMPEROR AND BEING PUT TO SHAME
WELL GOOD BY SO YOU'LL GIVE HER THE PACKET PIERRE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND PRINCESS MARY THE OLD MAN SEEMED LIVELIER THAN USUAL
SO READY TO BE FOND OF HIM FOR BEING HIS FATHER AND OF HER FOR BEING HIS SISTER
HAYNE THE SAME GROOM WHO HAD BEEN AT AUSTERLITZ LED UP THE EMPEROR'S HORSE
APART FROM THIS INSUPERABLE ANTIPATHY TO HER PRINCESS MARY WAS AGITATED JUST THEN
KUTUZOV BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT ABSENT MINDEDLY AS IF FORGETTING ALL HE WANTED TO SAY OR DO THEN EVIDENTLY REMEMBERING WHAT HE WANTED
I CANNOT BECAUSE THE LAW IS STRONGER THAN I AND HE RAISED HIS FOOT TO THE STIRRUP THE GENERAL BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY
NATASHA NOTICED THIS AND GUESSED ITS REASON I THINK PRINCESS IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO SPEAK OF THAT NOW SHE SAID WITH EXTERNAL DIGNITY AND COLDNESS THOUGH SHE FELT THE TEARS CHOKING HER
I COULD FORGIVE HER I CAN'T BUT CAN THIS BE COMPARED SAID PIERRE PRINCE ANDREW INTERRUPTED HIM AND CRIED SHARPLY YES ASK HER HAND AGAIN BE MAGNANIMOUS AND SO ON
THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS IN A STATE OF ALARM AND COMMOTION NATASHA WAS VERY ILL
YES EXACTLY THE LEFT FLANK IS NOW EXTREMELY STRONG THOUGH KUTUZOV HAD DISMISSED ALL UNNECESSARY MEN FROM THE STAFF
HERE ARE HER LETTERS AND HER PORTRAIT SAID HE HE TOOK THE PACKET FROM THE TABLE AND HANDED IT TO PIERRE GIVE THIS TO THE COUNTESS IF YOU SEE HER SHE IS VERY ILL SAID PIERRE
AND THAT BENNIGSEN MANAGED EVERYTHING NOW THE DECISIVE MOMENT OF BATTLE HAD COME WHEN KUTUZOV WOULD BE DESTROYED AND THE POWER PASS TO BENNIGSEN
THEM RECITE THEM SAID HE EVIDENTLY PREPARING TO LAUGH
AND THE LONGER THEY DID SO WITHOUT SAYING WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY
NATASHA FELT OFFENDED BY THE HESITATION SHE HAD NOTICED IN THE ANTEROOM BY HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS
WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES DOLOKHOV EMBRACED PIERRE AND KISSED HIM BORIS SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS GENERAL AND COUNT BENNIGSEN TURNED TO PIERRE AND PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD RIDE WITH HIM ALONG THE LINE
BUT ANOTHER MOTIVE WAS TO AVOID THE DANGER OF ENCOUNTERING THE OLD PRINCE OF WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE DID NOT MENTION THIS TO HIS DAUGHTER BUT NATASHA NOTICED HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY
AND HIS VALET WAS BUTTONING ON TO THE BACK OF HIS BREECHES A NEW PAIR OF HANDSOME SILK EMBROIDERED BRACES THAT FOR SOME REASON ATTRACTED ROSTOV'S ATTENTION
HE MEANT TO FORTIFY THAT KNOLL QUITE DIFFERENTLY BUT
GIVEN BY A BATTALION OF THE FRENCH GUARDS TO THE PREOBRAZHENSK BATTALION THE EMPERORS WERE TO BE PRESENT AT THAT BANQUET
SHE WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BY INVOLUNTARY ENVY OF HER BEAUTY YOUTH AND HAPPINESS AS WELL AS BY JEALOUSY OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE FOR HER
AND BECAUSE WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE FELT IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SPEAK OF THE MARRIAGE WHEN THE COUNT WAS ALREADY LEAVING THE ROOM PRINCESS MARY WENT UP HURRIEDLY TO NATASHA
HOW DID YOU GET HERE SAID A VOICE
ALL THE SUITE DREW BACK AND ROSTOV SAW THE GENERAL TALKING FOR SOME TIME TO THE EMPEROR THE EMPEROR SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM AND TOOK A STEP TOWARD HIS HORSE
WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE SOME DAYS AFTER ANATOLE'S DEPARTURE PIERRE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM PRINCE ANDREW INFORMING HIM OF HIS ARRIVAL AND ASKING HIM TO COME TO SEE HIM
AN OLD CROSS LOOKING FOOTMAN CAME AND ANNOUNCED TO THE ROSTOVS THAT THE PRINCE WAS NOT RECEIVING BUT THAT THE PRINCESS BEGGED THEM TO WALK UP
AND AT THE WAY HER BROTHER HAD TAKEN THE NEWS OF NATASHA'S FAITHLESSNESS HE SAYS HE EXPECTED IT SHE REMARKED I KNOW HIS PRIDE WILL NOT LET HIM EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS BUT
NATASHA WHAT IS IT ABOUT SHE ASKED WHAT DO THEY MATTER TO YOU IT WILL ALL PASS NATASHA
BUT I MAINTAIN THAT IF ANYTHING GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS REIGN IT WAS DONE BY HIM BY HIM ALONE HE PAUSED AT THE SIGHT OF PIERRE HIS FACE QUIVERED
IN THE DOGS SQUARE AND THEN
WARMLY DISPUTING AND VIGOROUSLY GESTICULATING THE CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT SPERANSKI THE NEWS OF WHOSE SUDDEN EXILE AND ALLEGED TREACHERY HAD JUST REACHED MOSCOW
I AM IN ATTENDANCE ON HIM YOU KNOW I'LL MENTION IT TO HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO RIDE ROUND THE POSITION COME ALONG WITH US WE ARE JUST GOING TO THE LEFT FLANK THEN WHEN WE GET BACK
NO I WON'T MISS MY OPPORTUNITY NOW AS I DID AFTER AUSTERLITZ HE THOUGHT EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO MEET THE MONARCH AND CONSCIOUS OF THE BLOOD THAT RUSHED TO HIS HEART
THEY WAITED A LONG TIME FOR NATASHA TO COME TO DINNER THAT DAY SHE SAT IN HER ROOM CRYING LIKE A CHILD BLOWING HER NOSE AND SOBBING SONYA STOOD BESIDE HER KISSING HER HAIR
OF COURSE YOU KNOW DMITRI SERGEEVICH
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE EMPEROR'S SUITE
BY BENNIGSEN IN ANY CASE MANY GREAT REWARDS WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR TOMORROW'S ACTION AND NEW MEN WOULD COME TO THE FRONT
THE MONARCH CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES AND CARRYING HIS HAT UNDER HIS ARM
THEN SHE IS HERE STILL SAID PRINCE ANDREW AND PRINCE KURAGIN HE ADDED QUICKLY HE LEFT LONG AGO
THAT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY THE PRINCESS TOLD THE COUNT THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED AND ONLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AT ANNA SEMENOVNA'S AND HE DEPARTED
IN ALL ITS OLD FORCE IN THE UNIFORM OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK REGIMENT WHITE CHAMOIS LEATHER BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND WEARING A STAR ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THAT OF THE LEGION D'HONNEUR
STOPPING BESIDE HIS HORSE WITH HIS HAND ON THE SADDLE THE EMPEROR TURNED TO THE CAVALRY GENERAL AND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE EVIDENTLY WISHING TO BE HEARD BY ALL I CANNOT DO IT GENERAL
I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S ADORERS IS SHE WELL MY QUARTERS ARE AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WITH OLD PEOPLE
KISS ME SAID SONYA NATASHA RAISED HER HEAD AND KISSING HER FRIEND ON THE LIPS PRESSED HER WET FACE AGAINST HER I CAN'T TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW
AND ARRESTED IN HIS PRESENCE FULLY ALIVE NOW TO THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT AND REPENTING OF IT ROSTOV WITH DOWNCAST EYES WAS MAKING HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RIGHT FLANK
PRINCESS MARY WAS THE SAME AS ALWAYS BUT BENEATH HER SYMPATHY FOR HER BROTHER PIERRE NOTICED HER SATISFACTION THAT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF LOOKING AT THEM PIERRE REALIZED
WHETHER THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS WERE AT HOME WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED A PERTURBATION WAS NOTICEABLE AMONG THE SERVANTS THE FOOTMAN WHO HAD GONE TO ANNOUNCE THEM
KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM CALL HIM TO ME SAID KUTUZOV
SO UNNATURALLY AND SO UNPLEASANTLY THAT PRINCESS MARY STOOD WITH DOWNCAST EYES
HE BECKONED TO ANDREW KAYSAROV HIS ADJUTANT'S BROTHER THOSE VERSES
WAS OCCUPIED BY THE DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HE SAW ON OTHER FACES AN EXPRESSION THAT SPOKE NOT OF PERSONAL MATTERS BUT OF THE UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH
LEST THE PRINCE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT INDULGE IN SOME FREAK AS HE SEEMED MUCH UPSET BY THE ROSTOVS VISIT
HE SAW THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH COLORS DRAPED FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE STREETS WITH HUGE MONOGRAMS A AND N
AND THE FEELING OF ENTHUSIASM AND LOVE FOR HIS SOVEREIGN
BUT THEY WERE NOT TO BE ADMITTED TO HIM
THE DOOR LEADING DOWNSTAIRS ONLY IT WON'T BE ACCEPTED ON HEARING THIS INDIFFERENT VOICE ROSTOV GREW FRIGHTENED AT WHAT HE WAS DOING
BORIS BELONGED TO THE LATTER AND NO ONE ELSE WHILE SHOWING SERVILE RESPECT TO KUTUZOV COULD SO CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THE OLD FELLOW WAS NOT MUCH GOOD
THEY DROVE UP TO THE GLOOMY OLD HOUSE ON THE VOZDVIZHENKA AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE WELL THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON US SAID THE COUNT
WHAT WOULD IT MATTER THOUGHT HE LOOKING AT AN OFFICER WHO WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE THE EMPEROR OCCUPIED AFTER ALL PEOPLE DO GO IN
AND WAS THEREFORE SURPRISED ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM TO HEAR HIM IN THE STUDY TALKING IN A LOUD ANIMATED VOICE ABOUT SOME INTRIGUE GOING ON IN PETERSBURG
AND THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER THEN A MAIDSERVANT RAN INTO THE HALL AND HURRIEDLY SAID SOMETHING MENTIONING THE PRINCESS AT LAST
PIERRE SAW THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS GOING TO SPEAK OF NATASHA AND HIS BROAD FACE EXPRESSED PITY AND SYMPATHY THIS EXPRESSION IRRITATED PRINCE ANDREW
STEPPED UP TO PIERRE'S SIDE NEAR KUTUZOV AND IN A MOST NATURAL MANNER
POISONED HERSELF THE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT ANATOLE WAS MARRIED WITH SOME ARSENIC SHE HAD STEALTHILY PROCURED AFTER SWALLOWING A LITTLE SHE HAD BEEN SO FRIGHTENED
FOLLOWING DAY ON THAT DAY JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH THE PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE WERE SIGNED THE EMPERORS EXCHANGED DECORATIONS ALEXANDER RECEIVED THE CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOR
I SAY DO YOU REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION IN PETERSBURG ASKED PIERRE ABOUT
AND AGAIN AFTER TWO YEARS SAW THOSE FEATURES HE ADORED THAT SAME FACE AND SAME LOOK AND STEP AND THE SAME UNION OF MAJESTY
WHOM HAVE YOU COME FROM WHO ARE YOU I COME FROM MAJOR DENISOV ANSWERED ROSTOV
OR SOMEONE PERSUADED HIM YOU SEE BUT BORIS DID NOT FINISH FOR AT THAT MOMENT KAYSAROV KUTUZOV'S ADJUTANT CAME UP TO PIERRE AH
ASSURING EVERYONE THAT NOTHING HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT HIS BROTHER IN LAW HAD PROPOSED TO HER AND BEEN REFUSED IT SEEMED TO PIERRE THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO CONCEAL THE WHOLE AFFAIR
BREAKING OFF HER ENGAGEMENT MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE HAD PURLOINED IT FROM PRINCESS MARY AND GIVEN IT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND HE HEARD FROM HIM THE STORY OF NATASHA'S ELOPEMENT
THEY HAVE PUT ON CLEAN SHIRTS AH A WONDERFUL A MATCHLESS PEOPLE SAID KUTUZOV AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD A MATCHLESS PEOPLE HE REPEATED WITH A SIGH
IF THERE WERE TREASON OR PROOFS OF SECRET RELATIONS WITH NAPOLEON THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC HE SAID WITH WARMTH AND HASTE I DO NOT AND NEVER DID LIKE SPERANSKI PERSONALLY
THIS MAN WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN THE ADJOINING ROOM A GOOD FIGURE AND IN HER FIRST BLOOM
I HAVE RECEIVED A REFUSAL FROM COUNTESS ROSTOVA AND HAVE HEARD REPORTS OF YOUR BROTHER IN LAW HAVING SOUGHT HER HAND OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IS THAT TRUE
BOWING AND LOOKING ROUND UNEASILY AS IF AFRAID THE OLD PRINCE MIGHT APPEAR I AM SO GLAD YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER VERY SORRY THE PRINCE IS STILL AILING
IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEEN FILLED UP WITH WOOD IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE
PRESENTLY I SAW THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE COTTAGE
AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL THE GIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR
HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES
THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
OR EVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OF VICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST AND LOATHING EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME
I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
A CONDITION MORE ABJECT THAN THAT
MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH OTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY
THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
CHAPTER ELEVEN IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ERA OF MY BEING
THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER
OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAY AND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THE NIGHTINGALE IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT
THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN I WALKED AND I BELIEVE DESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME
SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOOD BY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESS THROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THE MORNING MISTS
AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TO PERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROM THE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER
HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
AND I WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS
GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HAD CREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITH STONES AND WOOD
AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER
THIS WAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED AN OLD MAN SAT IN IT NEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST HE TURNED ON HEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY
BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED
AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
AND APPEARED BUSILY EMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS
THE APPEARANCE WAS DISCONSOLATE AND I FOUND MY FEET CHILLED BY THE COLD DAMP SUBSTANCE THAT COVERED THE GROUND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND I LONGED TO OBTAIN FOOD AND SHELTER AT LENGTH I PERCEIVED A SMALL HUT
I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOME CLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OF NIGHT
MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MY EARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS
I SLAKED MY THIRST AT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED
ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW I RETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBERED TOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER
AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
REFUGE IN A LOW HOVEL QUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HAD BEHELD IN THE VILLAGE THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEAT AND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE I DARED NOT ENTER IT
HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS
THE WET WOOD WHICH I HAD PLACED NEAR THE HEAT DRIED AND ITSELF BECAME INFLAMED I REFLECTED ON THIS AND BY TOUCHING THE VARIOUS BRANCHES
THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OF PLEASURE
SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN I FOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD
BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITH DRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE
WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEING RESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME WHAT WAS I
WHICH FLOWED BY MY RETREAT THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPT PERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM
HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP
EXCEPT THROUGH MEANS WHICH I OBTAINED BY STEALTH
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRST DECLINED IT SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT IN SWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER
RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
PITIABLE TO OTHERS AND INTOLERABLE TO MYSELF
THE LAKES AND THE DASHING OF THE ROCKY STREAMS WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DEAR SIGHTS TO ME HERE ALSO WE MADE SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO ALMOST CONTRIVED TO CHEAT ME INTO HAPPINESS
AND THIS WAS TO ME LIKE THE TORTURE OF SINGLE DROPS OF WATER CONTINUALLY FALLING ON THE HEAD EVERY THOUGHT THAT WAS DEVOTED TO IT WAS AN EXTREME ANGUISH AND EVERY WORD THAT I SPOKE IN ALLUSION TO IT CAUSED MY LIPS TO QUIVER AND MY HEART TO PALPITATE
THE MONSTER SAW MY DETERMINATION IN MY FACE AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN THE IMPOTENCE OF ANGER SHALL EACH MAN CRIED HE FIND A WIFE FOR HIS BOSOM
AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED AT AND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHES WHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONS OF MEN IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR
NOTHING COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE ALTERATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MY FEELINGS SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE DAEMON
AND AMONG THESE MOUNTAINS I SHOULD SCARCELY REGRET SWITZERLAND AND THE RHINE BUT HE FOUND THAT A TRAVELLER'S LIFE IS ONE THAT INCLUDES MUCH PAIN AMIDST ITS ENJOYMENTS HIS FEELINGS ARE FOREVER ON THE STRETCH
WE HAD SCARCELY VISITED THE VARIOUS LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND AND CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS WHEN THE PERIOD OF OUR APPOINTMENT WITH OUR SCOTCH FRIEND APPROACHED AND WE LEFT THEM TO TRAVEL ON FOR MY OWN PART
THE BOLT HAS ENTERED MY SOUL AND I FELT THEN THAT I SHOULD SURVIVE TO EXHIBIT WHAT I SHALL SOON CEASE TO BE
BUT I PRESENTLY RECOVERED MYSELF I WAS INNOCENT THAT COULD EASILY BE PROVED ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED MY CONDUCTOR IN SILENCE AND WAS LED TO ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN THE TOWN
BUT I WAS OVERCOME BY THE SENSATION OF HELPLESSNESS SO OFTEN FELT IN FRIGHTFUL DREAMS WHEN YOU IN VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FLY FROM AN IMPENDING DANGER AND WAS ROOTED TO THE SPOT PRESENTLY I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE PASSAGE
THE WIND WAS HIGH AND THE WAVES CONTINUALLY THREATENED THE SAFETY OF MY LITTLE SKIFF
AND LAYING THEM UP DETERMINED TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA THAT VERY NIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME I SAT UPON THE BEACH EMPLOYED IN CLEANING AND ARRANGING MY CHEMICAL APPARATUS
I TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT I FELT A PRESENTIMENT OF WHO IT WAS
I MIGHT BE DRIVEN INTO THE WIDE ATLANTIC AND FEEL ALL THE TORTURES OF STARVATION OR BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE IMMEASURABLE WATERS THAT ROARED AND BUFFETED AROUND ME I HAD ALREADY BEEN OUT MANY HOURS
THE DOOR OPENED AND THE WRETCH WHOM I DREADED APPEARED SHUTTING THE DOOR HE APPROACHED ME AND SAID IN A SMOTHERED VOICE YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE WORK WHICH YOU BEGAN
FOR AN INSTANT I DARED TO SHAKE OFF MY CHAINS AND LOOK AROUND ME WITH A FREE AND LOFTY SPIRIT BUT THE IRON HAD EATEN INTO MY FLESH AND I SANK AGAIN TREMBLING AND HOPELESS INTO MY MISERABLE SELF
AND I BANISHED FROM MY MIND EVERY THOUGHT THAT COULD LEAD TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING THE MOON ROSE AND I THEN PUTTING MY BASKET ABOARD A LITTLE SKIFF
AND THE DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES I ORDERED IT TO BE REPAIRED BOUGHT SOME FURNITURE AND TOOK POSSESSION
BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THE WEATHER PERMITTED I WALKED ON THE STONY BEACH OF THE SEA TO LISTEN TO THE WAVES AS THEY ROARED AND DASHED AT MY FEET IT WAS A MONOTONOUS YET EVER CHANGING SCENE I THOUGHT OF SWITZERLAND
TO THE SUPERIOR BEAUTY OF MAN SHE MIGHT QUIT HIM AND HE
THE STREETS ARE ALMOST MAGNIFICENT AND THE LOVELY ISIS WHICH FLOWS BESIDE IT THROUGH MEADOWS OF EXQUISITE VERDURE IS SPREAD FORTH INTO A PLACID EXPANSE OF WATERS WHICH REFLECTS ITS MAJESTIC ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWERS AND SPIRES AND DOMES
BUT I DID NOT REFLECT THAT A VOLUNTARY ACT OF MINE COULD AVERT IT I HAD RESOLVED IN MY OWN MIND THAT TO CREATE ANOTHER LIKE THE FIEND I HAD FIRST MADE WOULD BE AN ACT OF THE BASEST AND MOST ATROCIOUS SELFISHNESS
AND MY HEART FAILED WITHIN ME WHEN ON LOOKING UP I SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THE DAEMON AT THE CASEMENT A GHASTLY GRIN WRINKLED HIS LIPS AS HE GAZED ON ME
A FEW FISHING VESSELS ALONE SPECKED THE WATER AND NOW AND THEN THE GENTLE BREEZE WAFTED THE SOUND OF VOICES AS THE FISHERMEN CALLED TO ONE ANOTHER I FELT THE SILENCE ALTHOUGH I WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF ITS EXTREME PROFUNDITY
BUT I WAS IMPATIENT TO ARRIVE AT THE TERMINATION OF MY JOURNEY WE LEFT EDINBURGH IN A WEEK PASSING THROUGH COUPAR SAINT ANDREW'S
FOR THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LATTER CITY WAS MORE PLEASING TO HIM BUT THE BEAUTY AND REGULARITY OF THE NEW TOWN OF EDINBURGH ITS ROMANTIC CASTLE AND ITS ENVIRONS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IN THE WORLD ARTHUR'S SEAT SAINT BERNARD'S WELL
THE IDEA OF RENEWING MY LABOURS DID NOT FOR ONE INSTANT OCCUR TO ME
THE SIGHT OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE OR THE STUDY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SUBLIME IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF MAN COULD ALWAYS INTEREST MY HEART AND COMMUNICATE ELASTICITY TO MY SPIRITS BUT I AM A BLASTED TREE
AND TREMBLING WITH PASSION TORE TO PIECES THE THING ON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED THE WRETCH SAW ME DESTROY THE CREATURE ON WHOSE FUTURE EXISTENCE HE DEPENDED FOR HAPPINESS AND WITH A HOWL OF DEVILISH DESPAIR AND REVENGE
THAT I RESOLVED TO PROLONG MY STAY ON THE WATER AND FIXING THE RUDDER IN A DIRECT POSITION STRETCHED MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT CLOUDS HID THE MOON EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURE
AND THE SUN ROSE FROM THE OCEAN MY FEELINGS BECAME CALMER IF IT MAY BE CALLED CALMNESS WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF RAGE SINKS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR
WE HAD ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER AND IT WAS NOW FEBRUARY WE ACCORDINGLY DETERMINED TO COMMENCE OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE EXPIRATION OF ANOTHER MONTH IN THIS EXPEDITION
I EASILY PERCEIVED THE TRACES OF CULTIVATION I SAW VESSELS NEAR THE SHORE AND FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CIVILIZED MAN I CAREFULLY TRACED THE WINDINGS OF THE LAND
AND FILLED IT FOREVER WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE I WAS NOW ABOUT TO FORM ANOTHER BEING OF WHOSE DISPOSITIONS I WAS ALIKE IGNORANT SHE MIGHT BECOME TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE MALIGNANT THAN HER MATE AND DELIGHT FOR ITS OWN SAKE
NAY A WISH THAT SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE FACT STOLE ACROSS ME I DESIRED THAT I MIGHT PASS MY LIFE ON THAT BARREN ROCK WEARILY IT IS TRUE
BUT AS HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON MIGHT BE FOLLOWED EVEN SOONER THAN HE NOW CONJECTURED BY HIS LONGER VOYAGE HE ENTREATED ME TO BESTOW AS MUCH OF MY SOCIETY ON HIM AS I COULD SPARE HE BESOUGHT ME THEREFORE
AND ONE OF THESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED THIS I HIRED IT CONTAINED BUT TWO ROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLE PENURY THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED
BUT A BLIGHT HAD COME OVER MY EXISTENCE AND I ONLY VISITED THESE PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE INFORMATION THEY MIGHT GIVE ME ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH MY INTEREST WAS SO TERRIBLY PROFOUND COMPANY WAS IRKSOME TO ME
MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED IN ME A SLIGHT SENSATION OF ALARM AS IT WAS I MERELY REMARKED THAT THEY SPOKE ENGLISH AND I THEREFORE ADDRESSED THEM IN THAT LANGUAGE MY GOOD FRIENDS SAID I
HAVING PARTED FROM MY FRIEND I DETERMINED TO VISIT SOME REMOTE SPOT OF SCOTLAND AND FINISH MY WORK IN SOLITUDE I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT THE MONSTER FOLLOWED ME AND WOULD DISCOVER HIMSELF TO ME WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
BUT I WAS IN NO MOOD TO LAUGH AND TALK WITH STRANGERS OR ENTER INTO THEIR FEELINGS OR PLANS WITH THE GOOD HUMOUR EXPECTED FROM A GUEST AND ACCORDINGLY I TOLD CLERVAL THAT I WISHED TO MAKE THE TOUR OF SCOTLAND ALONE
AND I ALMOST FELT AS IF I HAD MANGLED THE LIVING FLESH OF A HUMAN BEING I PAUSED TO COLLECT MYSELF AND THEN ENTERED THE CHAMBER WITH TREMBLING HAND I CONVEYED THE INSTRUMENTS OUT OF THE ROOM
VEGETABLES AND BREAD WHEN THEY INDULGED IN SUCH LUXURIES AND EVEN FRESH WATER WAS TO BE PROCURED FROM THE MAINLAND WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT ON THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE WERE BUT THREE MISERABLE HUTS
THUS SITUATED MY ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND I CONFESS THAT I FELT A FEW SENSATIONS OF TERROR I HAD NO COMPASS WITH ME
AS MORTAL AS THAT OF CRIME I VISITED EDINBURGH WITH LANGUID EYES AND MIND AND YET THAT CITY MIGHT HAVE INTERESTED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BEING CLERVAL DID NOT LIKE IT SO WELL AS OXFORD
I WAS NOT SORRY I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MY PROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DAEMON'S DISAPPOINTMENT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCE ON MY RELATIVES
UNTIL MY EAR WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY THE PADDLING OF OARS NEAR THE SHORE AND A PERSON LANDED CLOSE TO MY HOUSE IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER I HEARD THE CREAKING OF MY DOOR AS IF SOME ONE ENDEAVOURED TO OPEN IT SOFTLY
I INQUIRED THE WAY TO THE INN BUT NO ONE REPLIED I THEN MOVED FORWARD AND A MURMURING SOUND AROSE FROM THE CROWD AS THEY FOLLOWED AND SURROUNDED ME WHEN AN ILL LOOKING MAN APPROACHING
THE INSOLENT GORING HIS QUEEN AND SON GAVE A PECULIAR INTEREST TO EVERY PART OF THE CITY WHICH THEY MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE INHABITED THE SPIRIT OF ELDER DAYS FOUND A DWELLING HERE AND WE DELIGHTED TO TRACE ITS FOOTSTEPS
EVEN IN THE EXCESS OF MISERY I CONSTRUCTED ANOTHER SAIL WITH A PART OF MY DRESS AND EAGERLY STEERED MY COURSE TOWARDS THE LAND IT HAD A WILD AND ROCKY APPEARANCE BUT AS I APPROACHED NEARER
HENRY WISHED TO DISSUADE ME BUT SEEING ME BENT ON THIS PLAN CEASED TO REMONSTRATE HE ENTREATED ME TO WRITE OFTEN
FOR A MOMENT MY SOUL WAS ELEVATED FROM ITS DEBASING AND MISERABLE FEARS TO CONTEMPLATE THE DIVINE IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND SELF SACRIFICE OF WHICH THESE SIGHTS WERE THE MONUMENTS AND THE REMEMBRANCERS
AND THE ONLY CHECK TO HIS ENJOYMENTS WAS MY SORROWFUL AND DEJECTED MIND I TRIED TO CONCEAL THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT DEBAR HIM FROM THE PLEASURES NATURAL TO ONE WHO WAS ENTERING ON A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UNDISTURBED BY
MY MIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYES WERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS
AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OF DISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETS OF NATURAL HISTORY
THE FIRST I HAD SHED FOR MANY MONTHS STREAMED FROM MY EYES AND I RESOLVED NOT TO FALL BEFORE MY ENEMY WITHOUT A BITTER STRUGGLE THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY
I WAS EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED ON RECEIVING SO RUDE AN ANSWER FROM A STRANGER
I SAW A LINE OF HIGH LAND TOWARDS THE SOUTH ALMOST SPENT AS I WAS
WHY DO YOU ANSWER ME SO ROUGHLY I REPLIED SURELY IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF ENGLISHMEN TO RECEIVE STRANGERS SO INHOSPITABLY I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE MAN
REMEMBER THAT I HAVE POWER YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF MISERABLE BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SO WRETCHED THAT THE LIGHT OF DAY WILL BE HATEFUL TO YOU YOU ARE MY CREATOR
I PACKED UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE MATERIALS I HAD COLLECTED RESOLVING TO FINISH MY LABOURS IN SOME OBSCURE NOOK IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND WE QUITTED LONDON ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF MARCH
IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCH PEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
AND WHEN HE BEGINS TO SINK INTO REPOSE HE FINDS HIMSELF OBLIGED TO QUIT THAT ON WHICH HE RESTS IN PLEASURE FOR SOMETHING NEW WHICH AGAIN ENGAGES HIS ATTENTION
BUT IN CLERVAL I SAW THE IMAGE OF MY FORMER SELF HE WAS INQUISITIVE AND ANXIOUS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND INSTRUCTION THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS WHICH HE OBSERVED WAS TO HIM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT
CHAPTER NINETEEN LONDON WAS OUR PRESENT POINT OF REST WE DETERMINED TO REMAIN SEVERAL MONTHS IN THIS WONDERFUL AND CELEBRATED CITY CLERVAL DESIRED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE MEN OF GENIUS AND TALENT WHO FLOURISHED AT THIS TIME
ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT THAT THEN WAS THE PERIOD FIXED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF MY DESTINY IN THAT HOUR I SHOULD DIE AND AT ONCE SATISFY AND EXTINGUISH HIS MALICE
SEVERAL HOURS PASSED AND I REMAINED NEAR MY WINDOW GAZING ON THE SEA IT WAS ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR THE WINDS WERE HUSHED AND ALL NATURE REPOSED UNDER THE EYE OF THE QUIET MOON
WHERE THE CURIOSITIES ARE DISPOSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE COLLECTIONS AT SERVOX AND CHAMOUNIX THE LATTER NAME MADE ME TREMBLE WHEN PRONOUNCED BY HENRY AND I HASTENED TO QUIT MATLOCK WITH WHICH THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS THUS ASSOCIATED
WHILE MY IMAGINATION CONJURED UP A THOUSAND IMAGES TO TORMENT AND STING ME WHY HAD I NOT FOLLOWED HIM AND CLOSED WITH HIM IN MORTAL STRIFE BUT I HAD SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART
I HAVE DWELT MANY MONTHS IN THE HEATHS OF ENGLAND AND AMONG THE DESERTS OF SCOTLAND I HAVE ENDURED INCALCULABLE FATIGUE AND COLD AND HUNGER DO YOU DARE DESTROY MY HOPES BEGONE
THE WIND DIED AWAY INTO A GENTLE BREEZE AND THE SEA BECAME FREE FROM BREAKERS BUT THESE GAVE PLACE TO A HEAVY SWELL I FELT SICK AND HARDLY ABLE TO HOLD THE RUDDER WHEN SUDDENLY
THIS SUDDEN CERTAINTY OF LIFE RUSHED LIKE A FLOOD OF WARM JOY TO MY HEART AND TEARS GUSHED FROM MY EYES
WHILE THIS STRANGE DIALOGUE CONTINUED I PERCEIVED THE CROWD RAPIDLY INCREASE THEIR FACES EXPRESSED A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND ANGER WHICH ANNOYED AND IN SOME DEGREE ALARMED ME
I WOULD NOT QUIT HENRY FOR A MOMENT BUT FOLLOWED HIM AS HIS SHADOW TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE FANCIED RAGE OF HIS DESTROYER I FELT AS IF I HAD COMMITTED SOME GREAT CRIME THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH HAUNTED ME I WAS GUILTLESS
WOULD BE CHILDREN AND A RACE OF DEVILS WOULD BE PROPAGATED UPON THE EARTH WHO MIGHT MAKE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE SPECIES OF MAN A CONDITION PRECARIOUS AND FULL OF TERROR HAD I RIGHT FOR MY OWN BENEFIT
AS WE ENTERED THIS CITY OUR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN TRANSACTED THERE MORE THAN A CENTURY AND A HALF BEFORE
AND QUICKLY AVAILED MYSELF OF THE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ADDRESSED TO THE MOST DISTINGUISHED NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS IF THIS JOURNEY HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING MY DAYS OF STUDY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD HAVE AFFORDED ME INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE
ARE YOU TO BE HAPPY WHILE I GROVEL IN THE INTENSITY OF MY WRETCHEDNESS YOU CAN BLAST MY OTHER PASSIONS BUT REVENGE REMAINS REVENGE HENCEFORTH DEARER THAN LIGHT OR FOOD
HE WAS ALSO PURSUING AN OBJECT HE HAD LONG HAD IN VIEW HIS DESIGN WAS TO VISIT INDIA IN THE BELIEF THAT HE HAD IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ITS VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND IN THE VIEWS HE HAD TAKEN OF ITS SOCIETY
WE DID NOT INTEND TO FOLLOW THE GREAT ROAD TO EDINBURGH BUT TO VISIT WINDSOR OXFORD MATLOCK AND THE CUMBERLAND LAKES RESOLVING TO ARRIVE AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS TOUR ABOUT THE END OF JULY
SEVERAL PEOPLE CROWDED TOWARDS THE SPOT THEY SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED AT MY APPEARANCE BUT INSTEAD OF OFFERING ME ANY ASSISTANCE WHISPERED TOGETHER WITH GESTURES THAT AT ANY OTHER TIME
YET STILL THE WORDS OF THE FIEND RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A DEATH KNELL THEY APPEARED LIKE A DREAM YET DISTINCT AND OPPRESSIVE AS A REALITY THE SUN HAD FAR DESCENDED
WHEN ALONE I COULD FILL MY MIND WITH THE SIGHTS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THE VOICE OF HENRY SOOTHED ME AND I COULD THUS CHEAT MYSELF INTO A TRANSITORY PEACE BUT BUSY UNINTERESTING JOYOUS FACES
THE PROSPECT DID NOT MOVE ME TO FEAR YET WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY BELOVED ELIZABETH OF HER TEARS AND ENDLESS SORROW WHEN SHE SHOULD FIND HER LOVER SO BARBAROUSLY SNATCHED FROM HER TEARS
AY SIR FREE ENOUGH FOR HONEST FOLKS MISTER KIRWIN IS A MAGISTRATE AND YOU ARE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS FOUND MURDERED HERE LAST NIGHT THIS ANSWER STARTLED ME
AND I REMAINED IDLE IN A PAUSE OF CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE MY LABOUR FOR THE NIGHT OR HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION BY AN UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO IT AS I SAT A TRAIN OF REFLECTION OCCURRED TO ME WHICH LED ME TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF
AND FELT THE TORMENT OF A BURNING THIRST A PRELUDE TO MY OTHER SUFFERINGS
I FEARED TO WANDER FROM THE SIGHT OF MY FELLOW CREATURES LEST WHEN ALONE HE SHOULD COME TO CLAIM HIS COMPANION IN THE MEAN TIME I WORKED ON AND MY LABOUR WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED
AND ASKED US IF THOSE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT ALLUREMENTS TO INDUCE US TO PROLONG OUR JOURNEY AS FAR NORTH AS PERTH WHERE HE RESIDED CLERVAL EAGERLY DESIRED TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION AND I ALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SOCIETY
AFTER PASSING SOME MONTHS IN LONDON WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PERSON IN SCOTLAND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OUR VISITOR AT GENEVA HE MENTIONED THE BEAUTIES OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID COME SIR YOU MUST FOLLOW ME TO MISTER KIRWIN'S TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF WHO IS MISTER KIRWIN WHY AM I TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF
AND HAILED A STEEPLE WHICH I AT LENGTH SAW ISSUING FROM BEHIND A SMALL PROMONTORY AS I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME DEBILITY
THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OF CLOSING BEFORE ME FOREVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THE HORIZON
DO YOU DARE TO BREAK YOUR PROMISE I HAVE ENDURED TOIL AND MISERY I LEFT SWITZERLAND WITH YOU I CREPT ALONG THE SHORES OF THE RHINE AMONG ITS WILLOW ISLANDS AND OVER THE SUMMITS OF ITS HILLS
HE SAID THAT HE WAS WEARING AWAY HIS TIME FRUITLESSLY WHERE HE WAS THAT LETTERS FROM THE FRIENDS HE HAD FORMED IN LONDON DESIRED HIS RETURN TO COMPLETE THE NEGOTIATION THEY HAD ENTERED INTO FOR HIS INDIAN ENTERPRISE
TO LEAVE MY SOLITARY ISLE AND TO MEET HIM AT PERTH THAT WE MIGHT PROCEED SOUTHWARDS TOGETHER THIS LETTER IN A DEGREE RECALLED ME TO LIFE AND I DETERMINED TO QUIT MY ISLAND AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWO DAYS
WE LEFT OXFORD WITH REGRET AND PROCEEDED TO MATLOCK WHICH WAS OUR NEXT PLACE OF REST THE COUNTRY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THIS VILLAGE RESEMBLED TO A GREATER DEGREE THE SCENERY OF SWITZERLAND BUT EVERYTHING IS ON A LOWER SCALE
EVERY MOMENT I FEARED TO MEET MY PERSECUTOR SOMETIMES I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND FEARING TO RAISE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE OBJECT WHICH I SO MUCH DREADED TO BEHOLD
YET BEFORE I DEPARTED THERE WAS A TASK TO PERFORM ON WHICH I SHUDDERED TO REFLECT I MUST PACK UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOR THAT PURPOSE
AND AVOIDED WITH SHUDDERING ANXIETY ANY ENCOUNTER WITH MY FELLOW CREATURES AT ONE TIME THE MOON
THE SOIL WAS BARREN SCARCELY AFFORDING PASTURE FOR A FEW MISERABLE COWS AND OATMEAL FOR ITS INHABITANTS WHICH CONSISTED OF FIVE PERSONS WHOSE GAUNT AND SCRAGGY LIMBS GAVE TOKENS OF THEIR MISERABLE FARE
THE DELIGHT OF CLERVAL WAS PROPORTIONABLY GREATER THAN MINE HIS MIND EXPANDED IN THE COMPANY OF MEN OF TALENT AND HE FOUND IN HIS OWN NATURE GREATER CAPACITIES AND RESOURCES
I PERCEIVED A SMALL NEAT TOWN AND A GOOD HARBOUR WHICH I ENTERED MY HEART BOUNDING WITH JOY AT MY UNEXPECTED ESCAPE AS I WAS OCCUPIED IN FIXING THE BOAT AND ARRANGING THE SAILS
THE REMAINS OF THE HALF FINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HAD DESTROYED
THAT I MAY STING WITH ITS VENOM MAN YOU SHALL REPENT OF THE INJURIES YOU INFLICT DEVIL CEASE AND DO NOT POISON THE AIR WITH THESE SOUNDS OF MALICE
I WALKED ABOUT THE ISLE LIKE A RESTLESS SPECTRE SEPARATED FROM ALL IT LOVED AND MISERABLE IN THE SEPARATION WHEN IT BECAME NOON AND THE SUN ROSE HIGHER
WILL YOU BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME THE NAME OF THIS TOWN AND INFORM ME WHERE I AM YOU WILL KNOW THAT SOON ENOUGH REPLIED A MAN WITH A HOARSE VOICE
WHICH MIGHT RELATE TO THE MOST ANIMATING EPOCH OF ENGLISH HISTORY OUR LITTLE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY WERE OFTEN PROLONGED BY THE SUCCESSIVE OBJECTS THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES WE VISITED THE TOMB OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS HAMPDEN AND THE FIELD ON WHICH THAT PATRIOT FELL
AND OF CLERVAL ALL LEFT BEHIND ON WHOM THE MONSTER MIGHT SATISFY HIS SANGUINARY AND MERCILESS PASSIONS THIS IDEA PLUNGED ME INTO A REVERIE SO DESPAIRING AND FRIGHTFUL
LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THAT WAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIR ALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH
THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE HIS COMPANION WITH THIS RESOLUTION I TRAVERSED THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND FIXED ON ONE OF THE REMOTEST OF THE ORKNEYS AS THE SCENE OF MY LABOURS IT WAS A PLACE FITTED FOR SUCH A WORK
TO INFLICT THIS CURSE UPON EVERLASTING GENERATIONS
AND MY HEART OFTEN SICKENED AT THE WORK OF MY HANDS THUS SITUATED EMPLOYED IN THE MOST DETESTABLE OCCUPATION
AND AT OTHER TIMES I TOILED DAY AND NIGHT IN ORDER TO COMPLETE MY WORK IT WAS INDEED A FILTHY PROCESS IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED DURING MY FIRST EXPERIMENT A KIND OF ENTHUSIASTIC FRENZY HAD BLINDED ME TO THE HORROR OF MY EMPLOYMENT
IMMERSED IN A SOLITUDE WHERE NOTHING COULD FOR AN INSTANT CALL MY ATTENTION FROM THE ACTUAL SCENE IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED MY SPIRITS BECAME UNEQUAL I GREW RESTLESS AND NERVOUS
THIS WAS A NEW SCENE TO US MOUNTAINEERS THE MAJESTIC OAKS THE QUANTITY OF GAME AND THE HERDS OF STATELY DEER WERE ALL NOVELTIES TO US FROM THENCE WE PROCEEDED TO OXFORD
MAN YOU MAY HATE BUT BEWARE YOUR HOURS WILL PASS IN DREAD AND MISERY
ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIS OWN INCLINATION AFTER BEHAVING AS BADLY AS POSSIBLE ALL DAY SHE SOMETIMES CAME FONDLING TO MAKE IT UP AT NIGHT
NO INDEED NOTHING OF THE SORT BUT TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER SYMPATHISE WITH HER SHE'S EVIDENTLY JUST THE SORT OF PERSON TO APPRECIATE HER SHE HAS LIVED SO MUCH IN FOREIGN SOCIETY
SHE HAD HEARD THE SOUND BEFORE AND SHE RECOGNISED IT
THEN HOWEVER I WENT THROUGH WIND AND RAIN AND BROUGHT ONE THE DOCTOR BACK WITH ME THE OTHER SAID HE WOULD COME IN THE MORNING LEAVING JOSEPH TO EXPLAIN MATTERS
I'M NOT SO IN THE LEAST I PROTEST
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE YOUR MIND MISS ARCHER HER COMPANION DECLARED IT'S ALREADY A MOST FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENT IT LOOKS DOWN ON US ALL IT DESPISES US DESPISES YOU YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME
HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GAMBLED FREELY A FEW VERY HARSH CRITICS WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BROUGHT UP HIS DAUGHTERS THEY HAD HAD NO REGULAR EDUCATION AND NO PERMANENT HOME THEY HAD BEEN AT ONCE SPOILED AND NEGLECTED
GO SAY THY PRAYERS CHILD AND ASK GOD'S PARDON
BUT ISABEL WAS IN A SITUATION THAT GAVE A VALUE TO ANY CHANGE SHE HAD A DESIRE TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND HER AND AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF TO BEGIN AFRESH THIS DESIRE INDEED WAS NOT A BIRTH OF THE PRESENT OCCASION
OF THE CHOREOGRAPHIC CIRCLE HER SISTER
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT I'M SORRY IF I MAKE THAT IMPRESSION ON YOU I DON'T THINK IT'S A NICE IMPRESSION TO MAKE
I THINK YOU'RE ENCHANTING JUST AS YOU ARE
BUT AT LAST AFTER A PAUSE OF SOME DURATION RETURNING FOR A MOMENT TO THEIR OSTENSIBLE THEME AH WELL HE SAID I'M VERY GLAD INDEED YOU LIKE THE OLD BARRACK I WISH YOU COULD SEE MORE OF IT THAT YOU COULD STAY HERE A WHILE
THAT IT WAS ALTOGETHER A PAINFUL ONE NEVERTHELESS SHE MADE ANSWER TO HIS DECLARATION COLDLY ENOUGH JUST AS YOU PLEASE
MIGHT WATCH A FREE GREYHOUND I WANT TO SEE HER SAFELY MARRIED THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE SHE FREQUENTLY NOTED TO HER HUSBAND WELL I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE NO PARTICULAR DESIRE TO MARRY HER
AND SAYING WHY CANST THOU NOT ALWAYS BE A GOOD LASS CATHY
HER FATHER HAD KEPT IT AWAY FROM HER HER HANDSOME MUCH LOVED FATHER WHO ALWAYS HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO IT IT WAS A GREAT FELICITY TO HAVE BEEN HIS DAUGHTER ISABEL ROSE EVEN TO PRIDE IN HER PARENTAGE
THAN SPOKE THEIR GOOD WISHES
TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS
THEN SHE ROSE AND MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM AND FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER PREFERRING THE PLACES WHERE THE VAGUE LAMPLIGHT EXPIRED SHE WAS RESTLESS AND EVEN AGITATED AT MOMENTS SHE TREMBLED A
NO I'M NOT EASILY CHARMED AND THEN HE STOPPED A MOMENT
FOR THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHOSE HEARTS AS THEY APPROACHED HER BEAT ONLY JUST FAST ENOUGH TO REMIND THEM THEY HAD HEADS AS WELL HAD KEPT HER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE SUPREME DISCIPLINES OF HER SEX AND AGE
THE RESULT WAS KALEIDOSCOPIC
BUT THIS OF COURSE WAS BETWEEN THEMSELVES
WHERE THEY LIVED WITH THEIR BROTHER AND THEN THEY MIGHT SEE HER VERY VERY OFTEN THEY WONDERED IF SHE WOULDN'T COME OVER SOME DAY AND SLEEP THEY WERE EXPECTING SOME PEOPLE ON THE TWENTY NINTH SO PERHAPS SHE WOULD COME WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE THERE
I FANCIED THE DISCONTENT OF AGE AND DISEASE
THEY'RE NOT MORBID AT ANY RATE
YOU CAN'T DO SO IF YOUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BY IRRELEVANT GOSSIP HIS OWN CONVERSATION
OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S APPEARANCE AND IN THE EVENING PREPARED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR AUNT'S COMMANDS OF WHAT ISABEL THEN SAID NO REPORT HAS REMAINED
IS ENGLAND NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
YES THAT'S WHAT YOU ENJOY MOST I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO SAID LORD WARBURTON
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD STAND THE TEST THE TEST I
LORD WARBURTON WAS BRIEFLY SILENT YOU JUDGE ONLY FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU DON'T CARE HE SAID PRESENTLY YOU ONLY CARE TO AMUSE YOURSELF
TO HOPE WHAT THAT IN FUTURE I MAY SEE YOU OFTEN
AND THE MORE FEEBLE THE MASTER BECAME THE MORE INFLUENCE HE GAINED HE WAS RELENTLESS IN WORRYING HIM ABOUT HIS SOUL'S CONCERNS AND ABOUT RULING HIS CHILDREN RIGIDLY
AND HER SISTER ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY I'VE NEVER KEPT UP WITH ISABEL
ABOVE ALL WITH RIGHTNESS OF EFFECT NINETEEN PERSONS OUT OF TWENTY INCLUDING THE YOUNGER SISTER HERSELF
BUT FOR MYSELF I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
HE HAD SUMMUT TO DO I SHALL BID FATHER GOOD NIGHT FIRST SAID CATHERINE PUTTING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK BEFORE WE COULD HINDER HER THE POOR THING DISCOVERED HER LOSS DIRECTLY SHE SCREAMED OUT
YOU'RE SO GOOD AS TO HAVE A THEORY ABOUT ME
WE ALL KEPT AS MUTE AS MICE A FULL HALF HOUR
RISING FROM A BROAD STILL MOAT IT AFFECTED THE YOUNG VISITOR AS A CASTLE IN A LEGEND THE DAY WAS COOL AND RATHER LUSTRELESS THE FIRST NOTE OF AUTUMN HAD BEEN STRUCK
TOO INDIFFERENT TO SORDID CONSIDERATIONS
SO WE HUMOURED HIS PARTIALITY
CERTAINLY
HAD THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THINKING ALL THE OTHERS AESTHETIC VULGARIANS
WAS INDEED QUITE A SPLENDID YOUNG MAN HE INSPIRED HER WITH A SENTIMENT OF HIGH OF RARE RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER FELT EQUALLY MOVED TO IT BY ANY OTHER PERSON HE WAS SUPPOSED BY THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO WISH TO MARRY HER
MISS ARCHER THESE WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH AN INDEFINABLE SOUND WHICH STARTLED THE GIRL
IT'S THOUGHT A VERY GOOD POSITION SAID THE YOUNGER SISTER IT'S THE FIRST POSITION IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY I DARE SAY YOU THINK ME VERY IRREVERENT ISABEL TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK
AS REGARDS THAT SAID ISABEL I SHOULD FIND IN MY OWN NATION ENTERTAINMENT FOR A LIFETIME BUT WE'VE A LONG DRIVE AND MY AUNT WILL SOON WISH TO START SHE TURNED BACK
BUT HE WOULD NOT MOVE SO HE TOOK THE CANDLE AND LOOKED AT HIM I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AS HE SET DOWN THE LIGHT AND SEIZING THE CHILDREN EACH BY AN ARM
SAID MISS MOLYNEUX FINDING HER VOICE YES AND THE OTHER PLACES WHAT ARE THEY CALLED
THEY HAD BEEN CALLED ENCHANTING I CAN'T HELP IT ISABEL ANSWERED I THINK IT'S LOVELY TO BE SO QUIET AND REASONABLE AND SATISFIED I SHOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE THAT HEAVEN FORBID CRIED RALPH WITH ARDOUR
AS IT WERE QUITE CAPABLE OF FLOORING HIS MAN
IT DOESN'T DESERVE AN ANSWER I WANT TO SEE AS MANY COUNTRIES AS I CAN THEN YOU'LL GO ON JUDGING I SUPPOSE
SAID ISABEL I WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE THEM AT HOME SHE HAD THIS PLEASURE A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN WITH RALPH AND HIS MOTHER SHE DROVE OVER TO LOCKLEIGH
OF REQUESTING YOUR ATTENTION WHICH IT REWARDED ACCORDING TO THE CHARM YOU FOUND IN BLUE EYES OF REMARKABLE FIXEDNESS THE EYES OF A COMPLEXION OTHER THAN HIS OWN AND A JAW OF THE SOMEWHAT ANGULAR MOULD WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BESPEAK RESOLUTION
HAD NO IDEA WHY HER FATHER SHOULD BE CROSSER AND LESS PATIENT IN HIS AILING CONDITION THAN HE WAS IN HIS PRIME HIS PEEVISH REPROOFS
THEY HAD A BELIEF THAT SOME SPECIAL PREPARATION WAS REQUIRED FOR TALKING WITH HER HER REPUTATION OF READING A GREAT DEAL HUNG ABOUT HER LIKE THE CLOUDY ENVELOPE OF A GODDESS IN AN EPIC IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ENGENDER DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
HIS ABILITY IS KNOWN MILDRED ADDED EVERY ONE THINKS IT'S IMMENSE OH I CAN SEE THAT SAID ISABEL BUT IF I WERE HE I SHOULD WISH TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH I MEAN FOR THE HERITAGE OF THE PAST
SHE WAS REASSURED QUICKLY ENOUGH BY HER SENSE OF HIS GREAT GOOD MANNERS
SHE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN WE WERE ALL SCOLDING HER AT ONCE
SAID ISABEL SERIOUSLY WELL YOU THINK US QUAINT' THAT'S THE SAME THING
BY HIS KNACK OF SERMONISING AND PIOUS DISCOURSING
AND HIS HEAD SANK ON HIS BREAST
AS TO WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN COMMITTED THE CONSCIOUS SOLECISM OF FORGIVING THEM MUCH BAD PAINTING FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUBJECT WHILE THE CIVIL WAR WENT ON SHE WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE PASSED MONTHS OF THIS LONG PERIOD IN A STATE OF
IT APPEARED TO ISABEL THAT THE UNPLEASANT HAD BEEN EVEN TOO ABSENT FROM HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SHE HAD GATHERED FROM HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE THAT IT WAS OFTEN A SOURCE OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
SUCH AS I NEVER SAW A CHILD TAKE UP BEFORE AND SHE PUT ALL OF US PAST OUR PATIENCE FIFTY TIMES AND OFTENER IN A DAY FROM THE HOUR SHE CAME DOWN STAIRS TILL THE HOUR SHE WENT TO BED WE HAD NOT A MINUTE'S SECURITY
A CANDID NATURAL COUNTENANCE A CAPACIOUS APPETITE AND A TENDENCY TO INDISCRIMINATE LAUGHTER
HER TONGUE ALWAYS GOING SINGING LAUGHING AND PLAGUING EVERYBODY WHO WOULD NOT DO THE SAME
TIME ENOUGH TO INSTITUTE A SEARCH FOR A RICH ECCLESIASTICISM AND GIVE IT UP AS VAIN
I DON'T MEAN OF COURSE THAT YOU AMUSE YOURSELF WITH TRIFLES YOU SELECT GREAT MATERIALS THE FOIBLES THE AFFLICTIONS OF HUMAN NATURE THE PECULIARITIES OF NATIONS
ISABEL RETURNED DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A FALSE POSITION HER COMPANIONS EVIDENTLY HAD LOST THEMSELVES MY BROTHER'S POSITION MISS MOLYNEUX ENQUIRED
ABOUT LIFE AND WAS CONSTANTLY STARING AND WONDERING SHE CARRIED WITHIN HERSELF A GREAT FUND OF LIFE AND HER DEEPEST ENJOYMENT WAS TO FEEL THE CONTINUITY
I RAN TO THE CHILDREN'S ROOM THEIR DOOR WAS AJAR
WHO EXACTLY RESEMBLED THEM DEPRIVED OF THIS ADVANTAGE HOWEVER ISABEL'S VISITORS RETAINED THAT OF AN EXTREME SWEETNESS AND SHYNESS OF DEMEANOUR AND OF HAVING AS SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS IN THE MOOD FOR LIKING EVERYTHING
WHILE HE BRUSHED HIS HAT I'M SURE I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT EXCLAIMED THE GIRL
TO SEE AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE AND IT WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT BEFORE ISABEL WAS FOURTEEN HE HAD TRANSPORTED THEM THREE TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC GIVING THEM ON EACH OCCASION HOWEVER BUT A FEW MONTHS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED
BUT ISABEL CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SERIOUSNESS YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT LILY I DON'T FEEL GRAND AT ALL I'M SURE THERE'S NO HARM SAID THE CONCILIATORY LILY
FOR THE SERVANTS GENERALLY SAT IN THE HOUSE THEN AFTER THEIR WORK WAS DONE
IT HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY LIFE AND SHE HAD BEEN A VERY FORTUNATE PERSON
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT ME SAID LORD WARBURTON BUT I NEVERTHELESS DON'T THINK HE'D LIKE ME TO KEEP COMING TO GARDENCOURT
SHE PERCEIVED AFTERWARDS IT WAS ONE OF SEVERAL IN A WILDERNESS OF FADED
WAS LORD WARBURTON SUDDENLY TURNING ROMANTIC
THEE THAT MADE HER CRY AT FIRST AND THEN BEING REPULSED CONTINUALLY HARDENED HER
THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WAS CASPAR GOODWOOD
IF THEY HAD A FAULT IT WAS A WANT OF PLAY OF MIND BUT SHE PRESENTLY SAW THEY WERE CAPABLE OF DEEP EMOTION BEFORE LUNCHEON SHE WAS ALONE WITH THEM FOR SOME TIME
SAID THE ELDER SISTER BUT I DARE SAY YOU'LL TAKE US AS YOU FIND US
OF THE THINGS SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND HER THE YEARS AND HOURS OF HER LIFE CAME BACK TO HER AND FOR A LONG TIME IN A STILLNESS BROKEN ONLY BY THE TICKING OF THE BIG BRONZE CLOCK SHE PASSED THEM IN REVIEW
AND FARMING HIS BIT OF LAND HIMSELF
A CHANCE FOR WHAT A CHANCE TO DEVELOP OH MOSES EDMUND LUDLOW EXCLAIMED I HOPE SHE ISN'T GOING TO DEVELOP ANY MORE IF I WERE NOT SURE YOU ONLY SAID THAT FOR ARGUMENT
YOU'RE EASILY CHARMED MY LORD
HEATHCLIFF HE'S DEAD AND THEY BOTH SET UP A HEART BREAKING CRY
HE DIED QUIETLY IN HIS CHAIR ONE OCTOBER EVENING SEATED BY THE FIRE SIDE
IN WHICH THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING AS ONE LIKED APPEARED TO INCREASE AS ONE GREW OLDER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY MODIFIED BY THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM HIS CLEVER HIS SUPERIOR HIS REMARKABLE GIRL LATER WHEN THE JOURNEYS TO EUROPE CEASED
AND TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION AT A LOW TEMPERATURE THE POOR GIRL LIKED TO BE THOUGHT CLEVER BUT SHE HATED TO BE THOUGHT BOOKISH
AND IF HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED ABOUT MONEY MATTERS NOTHING EVER DISTURBED THEIR IRREFLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY POSSESSIONS
HINDLEY'S MANIFESTATION OF SCORN WHILE HIS FATHER WAS NEAR ROUSED THE OLD MAN TO A FURY HE SEIZED HIS STICK TO STRIKE HIM
ISABEL LIKED THEM EVEN BETTER AT HOME THAN SHE HAD DONE AT GARDENCOURT AND WAS MORE THAN EVER STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT MORBID IT HAD SEEMED TO HER BEFORE THAT
SINCE HIS DEATH SHE HAD SEEMED TO SEE HIM AS TURNING HIS BRAVER SIDE TO HIS CHILDREN AND AS NOT HAVING MANAGED TO IGNORE THE UGLY QUITE SO MUCH IN PRACTICE AS IN ASPIRATION BUT THIS ONLY MADE HER TENDERNESS FOR HIM GREATER
AND HEATHCLIFF WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS HEAD IN HER LAP I REMEMBER THE MASTER BEFORE HE FELL INTO A DOZE
OF A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD CONFIDED IN HIS HOSPITALITY SHE WAS RIGHT IN TRUSTING TO HIS GOOD MANNERS FOR HE PRESENTLY WENT ON LAUGHING A LITTLE AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF THE ACCENT THAT HAD DISCOMPOSED HER
DO YOU MEAN DO YOU MEAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXPENSE THE YOUNGER ONE ASKED I DARE SAY HE MIGHT LET ONE OR TWO OF HIS HOUSES SAID THE OTHER LET THEM FOR NOTHING ISABEL DEMANDED
FOR TWO PEOPLE MISS CATHY AND JOSEPH THE SERVANT YOU SAW HIM I DARESAY UP YONDER HE WAS AND IS YET MOST LIKELY THE WEARISOMEST SELF RIGHTEOUS PHARISEE
HE WAS ALSO LEAN AND BROWN HE WAS NOT ROMANTICALLY HE WAS MUCH RATHER OBSCURELY HANDSOME BUT HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD AN AIR
HOW THE BOY WOULD DO
GOT UP AND SAID THAT HE MUST ROUSE THE MASTER FOR PRAYERS AND BED
AND AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO MAKE USE OF HER JUDGEMENT ALONE SHE PAID THE PENALTY OF HAVING GIVEN UNDUE ENCOURAGEMENT
WHEN LORD WARBURTON SHOWED HER THE HOUSE AFTER LUNCHEON IT SEEMED TO HER A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IT SHOULD BE A NOBLE PICTURE WITHIN IT HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL MODERNISED SOME OF ITS BEST POINTS HAD LOST THEIR PURITY
THE SENSE OF SEEING TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE HER IMAGINATION WAS BY HABIT RIDICULOUSLY ACTIVE WHEN THE DOOR WAS NOT OPEN IT JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED INDEED TO KEEP IT BEHIND BOLTS
OF THEIR OPINIONS ISABEL WAS NEVER VERY DEFINITELY INFORMED
SHE HAD HAD THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MANY PEOPLE MADE THEM UNENVIABLE IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT
THERE HAD REALLY BEEN A CHANGE IN HER LIFE
ESPECIALLY THE LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE
ALMOST PASSIONATE EXCITEMENT IN WHICH SHE FELT HERSELF AT TIMES TO HER EXTREME CONFUSION
I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE LIBERAL MILDRED ARGUED GENTLY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO EVEN FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
I WON'T SAY NEVER I SHOULD FEEL VERY MELODRAMATIC MAY I COME AND SEE YOU THEN SOME DAY NEXT WEEK MOST ASSUREDLY WHAT IS THERE TO PREVENT IT NOTHING TANGIBLE
I HOPED HEARTILY WE SHOULD HAVE PEACE NOW
A REMARKABLY HANDSOME HEAD AND A VERY TAKING MANNER INDEED AS ONE OF THEM HAD SAID HE WAS ALWAYS TAKING SOMETHING THEY HAD DECLARED THAT HE WAS MAKING A VERY POOR USE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD SQUANDERED A SUBSTANTIAL FORTUNE
AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
AND SHE DEEMED THIS A GREAT CHARM FOR TWO OR THREE OF THE FRIENDS OF HER GIRLHOOD HAD BEEN REGRETTABLY OPEN TO THE CHARGE
FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING FRAME WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT
BUT LORD WARBURTON EXERCISED SOME INGENUITY IN ENGAGING HIS LEAST FAMILIAR GUEST IN A STROLL APART FROM THE OTHERS I WISH YOU TO SEE THE PLACE PROPERLY SERIOUSLY HE SAID
AT LAST OUR
SO VERY MUCH MORE FETCHING
HER FATHER HAD A LARGE WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE OF WHICH HIS RESTLESSNESS AND EVEN HIS OCCASIONAL INCOHERENCY OF CONDUCT HAD BEEN ONLY A PROOF
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A PARTISAN OF HER FATHER FOR SHE WAS THE MEMBER OF HIS TRIO WHO MOST MADE UP TO HIM FOR THE DISAGREEABLES HE DIDN'T MENTION IN HIS LAST DAYS HIS GENERAL WILLINGNESS TO TAKE LEAVE OF A WORLD
I CAN'T FANCY HIS GIVING UP HIS PROPERTY SAID MISS MOLYNEUX AH
AND SHE SAID AS GAILY AS POSSIBLE AND AS QUICKLY AS AN APPRECIABLE DEGREE OF AGITATION WOULD ALLOW HER I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO PROSPECT OF MY BEING ABLE TO COME HERE AGAIN NEVER SAID LORD WARBURTON
HER VISITORS FLUSHED AND HER COUSIN TOLD HER AFTER THEY WERE GONE THAT IF SHE SAID SUCH THINGS TO THOSE POOR GIRLS THEY WOULD THINK SHE WAS IN SOME WILD FREE MANNER PRACTISING ON THEM
AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE REGULARLY GRUMBLED
AS THE TWO WERE MAKING READY FOR THEIR VISIT I DO HOPE IMMENSELY SHE'LL DO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR ISABEL SHE HAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER WHAT IS IT YOU WISH HER TO DO EDMUND LUDLOW ASKED
THINKING HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN OF HER TIME HAD PRONOUNCED THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE RULE I HAVE HINTED AT A FOOLISH PERIOD OF HISTORY
I SHOULD FEEL VERY BADLY HIS WIFE REPLIED BUT YOU KNOW YOU LOVE HER
WAS TO KEEP HER SEPARATE FROM HIM YET SHE GOT CHIDED MORE THAN ANY OF US ON HIS ACCOUNT IN PLAY SHE LIKED EXCEEDINGLY TO ACT THE LITTLE MISTRESS USING HER HANDS FREELY AND COMMANDING HER COMPANIONS
BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
FRESH COMPLEXIONS AND SOMETHING OF THE SMILE OF CHILDHOOD YES THEIR EYES WHICH ISABEL ADMIRED WERE ROUND QUIET AND CONTENTED
ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT BESPOKE RESOLUTION TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF WHICH IN HALF AN HOUR CASPAR GOODWOOD WHO HAD ARRIVED HOPEFUL AS WELL AS RESOLUTE TOOK HIS WAY BACK TO HIS LODGING WITH THE FEELING OF A MAN DEFEATED
WHETHER SHE FELT GRAND OR NO SHE AT ANY RATE FELT DIFFERENT AS IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER LEFT TO HERSELF FOR THE EVENING SHE SAT A WHILE UNDER THE LAMP HER HANDS EMPTY HER USUAL AVOCATIONS UNHEEDED
SHE HAD OFTEN REMARKED IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE HELD HER RATHER WISTFULLY IN SIGHT
THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID
SAID MILDRED THE YOUNGER SISTER AT THE SAME TIME WARBURTON'S VERY REASONABLE MISS MOLYNEUX OBSERVED
SHE WAS SHORT AND SOLID AND HER CLAIM TO FIGURE WAS QUESTIONED BUT SHE WAS CONCEDED PRESENCE THOUGH NOT MAJESTY
AND THE AGITATIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS FOND OF SEEING GREAT CROWDS AND LARGE STRETCHES OF COUNTRY OF READING ABOUT REVOLUTIONS AND WARS OF LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PICTURES A CLASS OF EFFORTS
EXPRESSLY TO SEE HER HAVING LEARNED IN THE FORMER CITY WHERE HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS AND WHERE HE HAD HOPED TO FIND HER THAT SHE WAS STILL AT THE STATE CAPITAL
THEY HAD LIVED WITH NURSEMAIDS AND GOVERNESSES USUALLY VERY BAD ONES OR HAD BEEN SENT TO SUPERFICIAL SCHOOLS KEPT BY THE FRENCH FROM WHICH AT THE END OF A MONTH THEY HAD BEEN REMOVED IN TEARS THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER WOULD HAVE EXCITED
EYES LIKE THE BALANCED BASINS THE CIRCLES OF ORNAMENTAL WATER
HE REVERTED AT INTERVALS TO MATTERS MORE PERSONAL
AND LAUGHED AND ANSWERED WHY CANNOT YOU ALWAYS BE A GOOD MAN FATHER BUT AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM VEXED AGAIN SHE KISSED HIS HAND AND SAID SHE WOULD SING HIM TO SLEEP SHE BEGAN SINGING VERY LOW
RADICAL ISABEL ASKED SHE KNEW IT WAS TRUE BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT HER INTEREST IN HUMAN NATURE WAS KEEN
WHO HAD ELOPED WITH A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN STAYING AT THE SAME HOTEL EVEN IN THIS IRREGULAR SITUATION AN INCIDENT OF THE GIRL'S ELEVENTH YEAR
KINDNESS ADMIRATION BONBONS BOUQUETS
SHE LIVED IN ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY FOR DANCING PLENTY OF NEW DRESSES THE LONDON SPECTATOR THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS THE MUSIC OF GOUNOD THE POETRY OF BROWNING THE PROSE OF GEORGE ELIOT THESE THINGS NOW AS MEMORY PLAYED OVER THEM
AND IT HAD LED TO HER BEGINNING AFRESH A GREAT MANY TIMES
WERE ENCASED IN SEALSKIN JACKETS THEIR FRIENDLINESS WAS GREAT SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO SHOW IT THEY SEEMED SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF THE YOUNG LADY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND RATHER LOOKED
HE WAS CLEARLY TRYING HARD TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO MISSUS TOUCHETT RALPH HAD MET THE FRANK ADVANCES OF ONE OF THE DOGS BEFORE THE FIRE THAT THE TEMPERATURE
MY SISTERS HAVE TAKEN AN IMMENSE FANCY TO YOU IF THAT WOULD BE ANY INDUCEMENT THERE'S NO WANT OF INDUCEMENTS ISABEL ANSWERED BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T MAKE ENGAGEMENTS I'M QUITE IN MY AUNT'S HANDS
LOUD AND BITTER BUT JOSEPH ASKED WHAT WE COULD BE THINKING OF TO ROAR IN THAT WAY OVER A SAINT IN HEAVEN HE TOLD ME TO PUT ON MY CLOAK AND RUN TO GIMMERTON FOR THE DOCTOR AND THE PARSON
I NEEDN'T BE SO TERRIBLY EMANCIPATED DOUBTLESS NOT AND YET AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK YOUR UNCLE LIKES ME YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
EXCEPT THAT SHE'S SO ORIGINAL WELL I DON'T LIKE ORIGINALS I LIKE TRANSLATIONS MISTER LUDLOW HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPLIED
TO BE QUIET THAT YOU MIGHT COMFORT HER SHE WAS MUCH TOO FOND OF HEATHCLIFF
ISABEL DELAYED FOR SOME MINUTES TO GO TO HIM SHE MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A NEW SENSE OF COMPLICATIONS BUT AT LAST SHE PRESENTED HERSELF AND FOUND HIM STANDING NEAR THE LAMP HE WAS TALL STRONG AND SOMEWHAT STIFF
EDMUND LUDLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ANSWER IN AN EXTREMELY AUDIBLE TONE
BUT THE DEPTHS OF THIS YOUNG LADY'S NATURE WERE A VERY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE BETWEEN WHICH AND THE SURFACE COMMUNICATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY A DOZEN CAPRICIOUS FORCES
WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
YES TO BE SURE WE HAVE HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE
YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS
WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
