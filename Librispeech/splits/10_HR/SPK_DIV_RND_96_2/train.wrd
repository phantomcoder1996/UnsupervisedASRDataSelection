MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE DANGLARS EUGENIE
AND SAW A LITTLE SPECK UPON THE WATERS THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAIL AND WHEN IT CAME NEARER AND HAD GROWN LARGER BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER SAW THAT IT WAS THE SKYLARK COME HOME AGAIN
STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
HOW DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE GROWING OH SQUIRE SOBBED MARY I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE EACH DINGLE BELL I LOVED SO WELL BEFORE MY EYES IS DYING
AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
THEY LOOKED RATHER COMICAL ALL STANDING IN STIFF STRAIGHT ROWS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT MARY DID NOT MIND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WORKING SHE HEARD THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LOOKING UP
UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
OF WHICH A LAST VOLUME IS CAPABLE WHETHER BY HER IMPRUDENCE VULGARITY OR JEALOUSY WHETHER BY INTERCEPTING HER LETTERS RUINING HER CHARACTER OR TURNING HER OUT OF DOORS
AND HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE PAPA ASKED MARY WHO WAS PERCHED UPON HER FATHER'S KNEE WHERE SHE COULD NESTLE HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS BUSHY WHISKERS
BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE DRESS WAS HER PASSION SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE AND OUR HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE
AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
THE FLOWER BED WILL LOOK VERY PRETTY NOW THIS WAS WHAT MARY WAS ABOUT TO DO BUT SINCE HER MOTHER ADVISED IT SHE TRIED TO THINK OF ANOTHER WAY FOR AS I SAID SHE WAS CONTRARY AT TIMES
HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
WHO HAD HEARD WHAT THE SAILOR HAD SAID TO HIS LITTLE GIRL KNEW AT ONCE WHAT MARY MEANT SO SHE KISSED HER DAUGHTER AND REPLIED YES MARY YOU MAY HAVE THE FLOWER GARDEN IF YOU WISH WE WILL DIG A NICE LITTLE BED JUST AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
ASKED THE SQUIRE IN HIS KIND BLUFF VOICE AND MARY ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS I MUCH ADMIRE YOU KNOW PAPA DID SAY HE WON'T BE HOME AGAIN SQUIRE TILL ALL HAVE PASSED AWAY
THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
SHE NODDED AND SMILED TO HIM AND THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE RODE UP TO HER SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN WITH A SMILE AT HER FLOWERS THEN HE SAID TO HER IN RHYME FOR IT WAS A WAY OF SPEAKING THE JOLLY SQUIRE HAD
WERE ALL THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING THE CHOICE OF A SENSIBLE INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE MISTER ALLEN IN ONE RESPECT SHE WAS ADMIRABLY FITTED TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG LADY INTO PUBLIC
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
SAID MARY BUT THIS MUCH I MAY TELL YOU
AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
VERY AGREEABLE INDEED SHE REPLIED VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A GREAT YAWN I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE SAID HIS WIFE I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY THE SIGHT OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP MADE THEM AND SOON AFTER WHEN MARY HAD BEEN HUGGED BY HER TWO SUNBURNED BROTHERS AND WAS CLASPED IN HER FATHER'S STRONG ARMS SHE WHISPERED
AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
HOW OLD FASHIONED IT IS LOOK AT THE BACK AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT
HE SAID HIM THUS COUSIN IT STANDETH SO THAT WELL I SEE TO BRUGES YE WILL GO GOD AND SAINT AUSTIN SPEEDE YOU AND GUIDE

NOW SICKERLY THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST
ALL FOR HIS OWEN WORSHIP RICHELY IN WHICH ARRAY WE DANCE JOLLILY AND IF THAT HE MAY NOT PARAVENTURE OR ELLES LIST NOT SUCH DISPENCE ENDURE
IN ALL THAT HOUSE BUT AFTER THEIR DEGREE
AND COME AGAIN AS SOON AS E'ER I MAY FOR WHICH MY DEARE WIFE I THEE BESEEK
BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
MY LIFE IS A MISFORTUNE WORSE THAN ANY DOG'S I SEND GREETINGS TO ALIONA TO ONE EYED TEGOR AND THE COACHMAN AND DON'T LET ANY ONE HAVE MY MOUTH ORGAN I REMAIN YOUR GRANDSON
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
BUT WHERE TO GO AND HOW WAS AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE TO ME AS THE AGE OLD SEARCH FOR THE SPRING OF ETERNAL LIFE HAS BEEN TO EARTHLY MEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME I DECIDED THAT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD TAKE SOLA INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND OPENLY ASK HER TO AID ME
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
WHICH LAY JUST WITHIN MY RANGE OF VISION UPON THE LEDGE WHERE I HAD PLACED IT IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEN UNTIL POSSIBLY MIDNIGHT ALL WAS SILENCE THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD THEN SUDDENLY THE AWFUL MOAN OF THE MORNING BROKE UPON MY STARTLED EARS
I ATTEMPTED TO SPRING TO MY FEET BUT WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT MY MUSCLES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY WILL I WAS NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKE BUT AS UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE IT WAS THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
AND THEN COMMENCED A SYSTEMATIC RIFLING OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION REQUIRED SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH TIME A NUMBER OF THE CHARIOTS WERE REQUISITIONED TO TRANSPORT THE LOOT WHICH CONSISTED IN ARMS AMMUNITION SILKS FURS JEWELS STRANGELY CARVED STONE VESSELS
AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
AS I COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE STRANGE EXPRESSION I HAD NOTED UPON HER FACE AFTER MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRISONER THAT IT DENOTED JEALOUSY I COULD NOT SAY AND YET JUDGING ALL THINGS BY MUNDANE STANDARDS AS I STILL DID
AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
AS I DID NOT PARTICULARLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF THE INNUMERABLE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO ME IF THE SPIRIT PROMPTED THEM I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE A STEALTHY SOUND APPRISED ME OF THEIR NEARNESS AND THEN A WAR BONNETED PAINT STREAKED FACE WAS THRUST CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE CLIFF
WITH THIS ADDED INCENTIVE I NEARLY DROVE SOLA DISTRACTED BY MY IMPORTUNITIES TO HASTEN ON MY EDUCATION AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS I HAD MASTERED THE MARTIAN TONGUE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENABLE ME TO CARRY ON A PASSABLE CONVERSATION
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY ALL THAT I HEARD AT THIS TIME OUR SLEEPING QUARTERS WERE OCCUPIED BY THREE OR FOUR FEMALES AND A COUPLE OF THE RECENTLY HATCHED YOUNG BESIDE SOLA AND HER YOUTHFUL WARD MYSELF AND WOOLA THE HOUND
THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADULTS TO CARRY ON A DESULTORY CONVERSATION FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE LAPSING INTO SLEEP AND NOW THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I WAS ALWAYS A KEEN LISTENER ALTHOUGH I NEVER PROFFERED ANY REMARKS MYSELF
IT IS ONLY THE MEN OF HER KIND WHO WAR UPON US AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF OURS TOWARD THEM THEY LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL THEIR FELLOWS EXCEPT WHEN DUTY CALLS UPON THEM TO MAKE WAR WHILE WE ARE AT PEACE WITH NONE
THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
MAY THAT BRING YOU LUCK PINOCCHIO LAMP WICK CALLED OUT
WHICH IS COMING TO GET ME FOR THE LAST TIME ARE YOU COMING OR NOT BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT IN THAT COUNTRY BOYS NEVER HAVE TO STUDY
FOR ITS WHEELS WERE BOUND WITH STRAW AND RAGS IT WAS DRAWN BY TWELVE PAIR OF DONKEYS ALL OF THE SAME SIZE BUT ALL OF DIFFERENT COLOR SOME WERE GRAY OTHERS WHITE
IN SUDDEN DETERMINATION HE SAID HURRIEDLY GOOD BY FOR THE LAST TIME AND GOOD LUCK GOOD BY HOW SOON WILL YOU GO WITHIN TWO HOURS
WE SHALL SEE IF YOU ARE TELLING THE TRUTH
ONLY THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO A LAND WHERE WE SHALL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ALL THE RACKET WE LIKE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PINOCCHIO DID NOT ANSWER BUT SIGHED DEEPLY ONCE
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN LAMP WICK STOPPED LAUGHING HE TOTTERED AND ALMOST FELL PALE AS A GHOST HE TURNED TO PINOCCHIO AND SAID
YOURS FIRST THEN MINE WELL THEN
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT MARVELOUS COUNTRY
SHALL I SEE YOU AT MY PARTY TOMORROW BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT I GO
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PLAY PINOCCHIO WAKES UP ONE FINE MORNING AND FINDS A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM FINALLY THE WAGON ARRIVED IT MADE NO NOISE
ENJOY OURSELVES AND BE HAPPY FROM MORN TILL NIGHT AND WHY DID YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THAT FALSE FRIEND WHY
INDEED I KNOW HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED ME AND HOW HE ENJOYED SPEAKING ILL OF ME BUT I AM OF
TURNING ONCE MORE TO HIS FRIEND
WHERE CAN YOU FIND A PLACE THAT WILL AGREE BETTER WITH YOU AND ME NO SCHOOLS NO TEACHERS NO BOOKS
ON AWAKENING PINOCCHIO PUT HIS HAND UP TO HIS HEAD AND THERE HE FOUND GUESS HE FOUND THAT DURING THE NIGHT HIS EARS HAD GROWN AT LEAST TEN FULL
BUT WHAT FEVER IS IT THE DONKEY FEVER
IN CASE YOU DO DISOBEY YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO SUFFER NOT ANYONE ELSE WHY BECAUSE BOYS WHO DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR ELDERS ALWAYS COME TO GRIEF
BELIEVE ME IF YOU DON'T COME YOU'LL BE SORRY
THAT IN A FEW HOURS THEY WOULD REACH A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS NO BOOKS NO TEACHERS MADE THESE BOYS SO HAPPY THAT THEY FELT NEITHER HUNGER NOR THIRST
A DORMOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM A FAT LITTLE DORMOUSE WHO LIVED UPSTAIRS SEEING PINOCCHIO SO GRIEF STRICKEN SHE ASKED HIM ANXIOUSLY WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR LITTLE NEIGHBOR
IS SHE AFRAID THE BATS WILL EAT YOU UP LISTEN LAMP WICK
EVEN FROM HIS BIRTH HAD VERY SMALL EARS SO SMALL INDEED THAT TO THE NAKED EYE THEY COULD HARDLY BE SEEN FANCY HOW HE FELT WHEN HE NOTICED THAT
BLOWING OF TRUMPETS THAT IT WAS DEAFENING EVERYWHERE GROUPS OF BOYS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SOME PLAYED AT MARBLES AT HOPSCOTCH AT BALL OTHERS RODE ON BICYCLES OR ON WOODEN HORSES SOME PLAYED AT
OVERNIGHT THOSE TWO DAINTY ORGANS HAD BECOME AS LONG AS SHOE BRUSHES HE WENT IN SEARCH OF A MIRROR BUT NOT FINDING ANY HE JUST FILLED A BASIN WITH WATER AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS IN HEARTY APPLAUSE SUDDENLY THE LITTLE DONKEY GAVE A KICK WITH HIS TWO HIND FEET AND AT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE
YOU MAY INVITE YOUR FRIENDS TO TOMORROW'S PARTY ONLY REMEMBER TO RETURN HOME BEFORE DARK DO YOU UNDERSTAND
AND FOUND A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM A SURPRISE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL VERY UNHAPPY
THE BOY'S REAL NAME WAS ROMEO BUT EVERYONE CALLED HIM LAMP WICK
LARGE THOUGH IT WAS WAS COMPOSED WHOLLY OF BOYS THE OLDEST WERE ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE THE YOUNGEST EIGHT IN THE STREET THERE WAS SUCH A RACKET SUCH SHOUTING SUCH
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD LUCK IS MINE WHAT IS IT TOMORROW I END MY DAYS AS A MARIONETTE AND BECOME A BOY LIKE YOU AND ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS
HOW WELL I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU A DAY WILL COME
I WONDER IF HE TOO HAS DONKEY FEVER BUT PRETENDING HE HAD SEEN NOTHING HE ASKED WITH A SMILE HOW ARE YOU MY DEAR LAMP WICK VERY WELL
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BAG PINOCCHIO FELT SLIGHTLY HAPPIER AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY FRIEND MUST BE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME SICKNESS THAT I AM
AND AS IF FEARING SHE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE YOU WROTE TO ME CONCERNING THE MARRIAGE OF THIS CHILD YES MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT IT IS NOT ONLY PROJECTED BUT ARRANGED YOUR INTENDED SON IN LAW
WHEN HE HAD RUN OVER ALL THESE NAMES IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN READ AND STUDIED THEM COMMENTING MEANWHILE UPON HIS LISTS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE MURMURED
BUT FIRST OF ALL
ON THE CONTRARY HER EYES GLISTENED AND SHE APPEARED TO BE SUFFERING FROM VIOLENT NERVOUS IRRITABILITY OH DEAR GRANDMAMMA ARE YOU WORSE EXCLAIMED VALENTINE PERCEIVING ALL THESE SIGNS OF AGITATION
WITH MY EYES SHUT IN THE SPOT WHERE YOU ARE NOW STANDING ISSUING FROM THAT CORNER WHERE THERE IS A DOOR LEADING INTO MADAME VILLEFORT'S DRESSING ROOM I SAW I TELL YOU SILENTLY ENTER A WHITE FIGURE
THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
FILLED HIS MIND WITH SO MANY GLOOMY THOUGHTS AND BITTER RECOLLECTIONS THEN INSTEAD OF PLUNGING INTO THE MASS OF DOCUMENTS PILED BEFORE HIM HE OPENED THE DRAWER OF HIS DESK TOUCHED A SPRING AND DREW OUT A PARCEL OF CHERISHED MEMORANDA
AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
VALENTINE FOUND HER GRANDMOTHER IN BED SILENT CARESSES HEARTWRUNG SOBS BROKEN SIGHS
MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER INTERRUPTED VALENTINE CONSIDER DECORUM THE RECENT DEATH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME MARRY UNDER SUCH SAD AUSPICES MY CHILD EXCLAIMED THE OLD LADY SHARPLY LET US HEAR NONE OF THE CONVENTIONAL OBJECTIONS
YES MADAME IS HE NOT THE SON OF GENERAL D'EPINAY WHO WAS ON OUR SIDE AND WHO WAS ASSASSINATED SOME DAYS BEFORE THE USURPER RETURNED FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA THE SAME
AMONGST WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY ARRANGED IN CHARACTERS ONLY KNOWN TO HIMSELF THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO EITHER IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN MONEY MATTERS AT THE BAR OR IN HIS MYSTERIOUS LOVE AFFAIRS HAD BECOME HIS ENEMIES
AMONG ALL THE INCOHERENT DETAILS GIVEN TO ME BY THE ABBE BUSONI AND BY LORD WILMORE BY THAT FRIEND AND THAT ENEMY ONE THING APPEARS CERTAIN AND CLEAR IN MY OPINION THAT IN NO PERIOD IN NO CASE IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE
FROM THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN BEHOLDS AT HIS FEET THE CRAGGY EMINENCES THE ALMOST IMPASSABLE PATHS AND THE FEARFUL CHASMS THROUGH WHICH HE HAS SO PERILOUSLY CLIMBED
AND THIS MORNING SHE FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I THOUGHT HER MAD AND MY FATHER WHO YOU KNOW IS A STRONG MINDED MAN HIMSELF APPEARED DEEPLY IMPRESSED WE WILL GO AND SEE SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT YOU TELL ME SEEMS VERY STRANGE
ALWAYS I TELL YOU I AM GOING TO DIE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WELL BEFORE DYING I WISH TO SEE MY SON IN LAW I WISH TO TELL HIM TO MAKE MY CHILD HAPPY I WISH TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE INTENDS TO OBEY ME
NO MY CHILD NO SAID MADAME DE SAINT MERAN BUT I WAS IMPATIENTLY WAITING FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THAT I MIGHT SEND FOR YOUR FATHER MY FATHER INQUIRED VALENTINE UNEASILY YES I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM
THE NOISE OF A CARRIAGE SOUNDED IN THE YARD THEN HE HEARD THE STEPS OF AN AGED PERSON ASCENDING THE STAIRS FOLLOWED BY TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SUCH AS SERVANTS ALWAYS GIVE VENT TO
WHAT A MISFORTUNE I SHALL DIE OF IT OH YES I SHALL CERTAINLY DIE OF IT AND THEN FALLING UPON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR SHE BURST INTO A PAROXYSM OF SOBS THE SERVANTS
WE WENT OUT TOGETHER IN THE CARRIAGE AFTER DINNER
BUT WHICH GENERALLY SCARCELY SATISFIED HIS INORDINATE DESIRES BUT THIS TIME THE PAPERS WERE A MERE MATTER OF FORM VILLEFORT HAD SECLUDED HIMSELF NOT TO STUDY
THEN FROM THE BENCH SHE WENT TO THE GATE AS USUAL VALENTINE STROLLED FOR A SHORT TIME AMONG HER FLOWERS BUT WITHOUT GATHERING THEM THE MOURNING IN HER HEART FORBADE HER ASSUMING THIS SIMPLE ORNAMENT
JUST AS HE WAS HIS MIND PERFECTLY CLEAR BUT THE SAME INCAPABILITY OF MOVING OR SPEAKING
IMMEDIATELY BUT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO LATE YES BUT THEN HE COULD TELL
MORE THAN ONCE SHE THOUGHT OF REVEALING ALL TO HER GRANDMOTHER AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED A MOMENT IF MAXIMILIAN MORREL HAD BEEN NAMED ALBERT DE MORCERF OR RAOUL DE CHATEAU RENAUD BUT MORREL
AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING UPON THE POLITICAL FUTURE THAT HAD SO OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS AMBITIOUS DREAMS WAS IMAGINING A FUTURE LIMITED TO THE ENJOYMENTS OF HOME IN FEAR OF AWAKENING THE ENEMY THAT HAD SO LONG SLEPT
MAY HAVE HEARD IT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF BUT WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF UPON THE SUBJECT ASKED VILLEFORT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
I THINK THAT WHEN ONE IS IN TROUBLE ONE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF WEEPING WHERE IS VALENTINE SIR IT IS ON HER ACCOUNT I AM HERE I WISH TO SEE VALENTINE
AND WITH THE DOOR LOCKED AND ORDERS GIVEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED EXCEPTING FOR IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE SAT DOWN IN HIS ARM CHAIR AND BEGAN TO PONDER OVER THE EVENTS THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HAD DURING THE LAST EIGHT DAYS
DOES HE NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF MARRYING THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A JACOBIN OUR CIVIL DISSENSIONS ARE NOW HAPPILY EXTINGUISHED MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT
THIS FORT THE ADMIRAL IN THOSE DAYS OF WAITING HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION SECRETLY TO GARRISON AND REARM FOR THE PURPOSE HE HAD STRIPPED THE FORT OF COJERO FARTHER OUT ON THE GULF OF ITS ENTIRE ARMAMENT
SO WEARY ME NO MORE WITH YOUR COWARD COUNSELS I MAKE NO TERMS WITH CAPTAIN BLOOD I KNOW MY DUTY TO MY KING AND I INTEND TO PERFORM IT I ALSO KNOW MY DUTY TO MYSELF I HAVE A PRIVATE SCORE WITH THIS RASCAL
BUT NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO ME YOU ALL KNOW SO MUCH MORE NAME OF GOD CAPTAIN BLOOD HE WILL GO ON AND WE GO ON WE GO TO GIBRALTAR TRUE THAT AT LAST AFTER LONG TIME WE CATCH THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR
IN THE ALREADY CORDIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GOVERNOR OF TORTUGA AT THE FINE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS GREEN JALOUSIED WINDOWS
FROM WHAT HAS OCCURRED YOU MAY JUDGE OF WHAT MUST OCCUR I SHOULD NOT TROUBLE YOUR EXCELLENCY WITH THIS LETTER BUT THAT I AM A HUMANE MAN ABHORRING BLOODSHED THEREFORE
WHICH WAS HIS OWN TO LOSE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO ISN'T SO NO DOUBT HE'LL LOSE IT WITH FEWER MISGIVINGS I AM SORRY WASTE LIKE BLOODSHED IS A THING ABHORRENT TO ME BUT THERE YE ARE
LEANING LIGHTLY UPON HIS LONG EBONY CANE HIS FACE SHADED BY A BROAD PLUMED HAT THERE WAS IN HIS APPEARANCE NOTHING OF THE BUCCANEER HE HAD MUCH MORE THE AIR OF A LOUNGER
SAILED INTO THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND EFFECTED ITS RAID UPON THAT OPULENT CITY OF THE MAIN THE AFFAIR DID NOT PROCEED EXACTLY AS WAS HOPED AND BLOOD'S FORCE CAME TO FIND ITSELF IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION
ALTHOUGH HIT BY ONE SHOT ONLY THIS HAD CRUSHED HER LARBOARD TIMBERS ON THE WATERLINE STARTING A LEAK THAT MUST PRESENTLY HAVE FILLED HER BUT FOR THE PROMPT ACTION OF THE EXPERIENCED YBERVILLE IN ORDERING HER LARBOARD GUNS TO BE FLUNG OVERBOARD
THE LATTER RATHER SINCE HIS ELEGANT SUIT OF VIOLET TAFFETAS WITH GOLD EMBROIDERED BUTTON HOLES WAS IN THE SPANISH FASHION BUT THE LONG STOUT SERVICEABLE RAPIER THRUST UP BEHIND BY THE LEFT HAND
THE MOOD OF THE MEN ENHEARTENED HIM YOU THINK PERHAPS THIS YOUR CAPTAIN BLOOD IS THE GOOD GOD THAT HE CAN MAKE MIRACLES EH HE IS RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH HIS GRAND AIR AND HIS
CEASING TO DISPUTE OUR PASSAGE OR HINDER OUR DEPARTURE AND A RANSOM OF FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT FOR MARACAYBO WE SHALL REDUCE THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY TO ASHES AND THEREAFTER GO OUT AND DESTROY HIS FLEET
WE SAIL AT ONCE BON VOYAGE SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD
BUT SUCH WAS THE DAMAGE SHE HERSELF SUSTAINED THAT PRESENTLY COMING UNDER THE GUNS OF THE FORT SHE BEGAN TO SINK AND FINALLY SETTLED DOWN IN THE SHALLOWS WITH PART OF HER HULL ABOVE WATER THENCE SOME IN BOATS AND SOME BY SWIMMING
THAT STIRRED THROUGH THE PURPLE DARKNESS OF THE TROPICAL NIGHT
THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED IN THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY CAHUSAC WHICH PITT HAS CAREFULLY RECORDED IN THE COURSE OF AN ALTERCATION THAT BROKE OUT
FROM THE FATE WITH WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS THREATENING IT AND AS HE RECKONED SO IT BEFELL THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ADDED HIS OWN PASSIONATE PLEADING TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE LETTER BUT DON MIGUEL WAS OF STOUTER HEART
BEHIND ENHEARTENED HIM YOU HAVE REFUSE YOU HAVE REFUSE ALREADY AND WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
FOLLOWED BY GUARDS HIS MOMENTARY TRUCULENCE UTTERLY SPENT BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DEPARTED THAN UP LEAPT CAHUSAC
HE HAD IT IN THE PESSIMISM OF WHICH CAHUSAC DID NOT ECONOMIZE EXPRESSIONS TRANSPORTED AT FIRST TO HEIGHTS OF DIZZY SATISFACTION BY THE SWIFT AND EASY VICTORY OF THEIR INFERIOR FORCE THAT MORNING
I'LL HAVE THE FAGGOTS TO THE PLACE IN THE MORNING AND MAYBE WHEN HE SEES THE BLAZE TO MORROW NIGHT HE'LL BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT PETER BLOOD IS A MAN OF HIS WORD YE MAY GO DON FRANCISCO THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WENT OUT WITH DRAGGING FEET
NOURISHED BY A SCORE OF RIVERS FROM THE SNOW CAPPED RANGES THAT SURROUND IT ON TWO SIDES IS SOME HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES IN LENGTH AND ALMOST THE SAME DISTANCE ACROSS AT ITS WIDEST IT IS AS HAS BEEN INDICATED IN THE SHAPE OF A GREAT BOTTLE
HE BADE THEM BRING HIM FROM AMONG THE PRISONERS THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF MARACAYBO WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AT GIBRALTAR DISCLOSING ITS CONTENTS TO HIM HE DESPATCHED HIM WITH IT TO DON MIGUEL
THE NEAREST GAPING SCUTTLE INTO THE HOLD AND THEREUPON DIVED OVERBOARD IN HIS TURN TO BE PICKED UP PRESENTLY BY THE LONGBOAT FROM THE ARABELLA BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THE SLOOP WAS A THING OF FIRE FROM WHICH EXPLOSIONS WERE HURLING BLAZING COMBUSTIBLES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE YOU WOULD NOT BE PILOTED YOU KNEW YOUR WAY
HE WOULD SO SOON AS HE WAS REENFORCED BY A FIFTH SHIP THE SANTO NINO ON ITS WAY TO JOIN HIM FROM LA GUAYRA HIMSELF COME INSIDE TO SEEK THEM AT MARACAYBO THIS TIME CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS PUT OUT OF TEMPER
COMPLACENTLY HE PULLED AT A PIPE THAT WAS LOADED WITH THAT FRAGRANT SACERDOTES TOBACCO FOR WHICH GIBRALTAR WAS FAMOUS AND OF WHICH
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO DEAL WITH YOUR FORT WHICH YOU MAY DEEM INVINCIBLE AS I HAVE DEALT ALREADY WITH YOUR FLEET WHICH YOU DEEMED INVINCIBLE I MAKE YOU PURELY OUT OF HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS THIS LAST OFFER OF TERMS
HE SPOKE WITH A RESTRAINT WHICH I TRUST YOU WILL AGREE WAS ADMIRABLE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE SPANISH FLEET GUARDING THE BOTTLE NECK EXIT OF THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND AWAITING THERE THE COMING FORTH OF CAPTAIN BLOOD
THE STERN CHASERS OF THE SALVADOR DESULTORILY
IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
AS HE STRODE AWAY SO DID THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES WHO WERE OUT SO EARLY THE CHARITY BOYS WITH SHINING FACES THE GREENGROCER LOLLING AT HIS DOOR
SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE TOLD HIM HOW THEY OWED EVERYTHING WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD TO THAT KIND FRIEND'S BENEVOLENT CARE OF THEM HOW HE HAD BEFRIENDED THEM ALL THROUGH THEIR POVERTY AND MISFORTUNES
AND THE LETTERS THE NEATLY DOCKETED BILLS AND SYMMETRICAL PAMPHLETS THE LOCKED ACCOUNT BOOKS DESKS AND DISPATCH BOXES THE BIBLE THE QUARTERLY REVIEW AND THE COURT GUIDE
AS RAWDON IN HIS EVENING COSTUME WHICH HE HAD NOW WORN TWO DAYS PASSED BY THE SCARED FEMALE WHO WAS SCOURING THE STEPS AND ENTERED INTO HIS BROTHER'S STUDY LADY JANE
IN THE MOST POLITE MANNER TO APPOINT A FRIEND WITH WHOM HE CAPTAIN M M MIGHT COMMUNICATE AND DESIRED THAT THE MEETING MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
WAS ONE OF THEM THAT TENDER LOVE SONG OF WEBER'S WHICH IN OLD FASHIONED DAYS YOUNG LADIES AND WHEN YOU WERE SCARCELY BORN SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO LIVED BEFORE YOU KNEW
HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
SAID THE MAN THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS THE LANDLORD'S COME IN AND TOOK POSSESSION THE SERVANTS WAS A DRINKIN UP IN THE DRAWINGROOM THEY SAID
RAWDON DISPATCHED CAPTAIN MACMURDO'S SERVANT TO CURZON STREET WITH AN ORDER TO THE DOMESTIC THERE TO GIVE UP A BAG OF CLOTHES OF WHICH THE COLONEL HAD GREAT NEED AND DURING THE MAN'S ABSENCE
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IN A WORD WAS RESTING HIMSELF AFTER THE NIGHT'S LABOURS AND NOT BEING ON DUTY WAS IN BED HIS ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH BOXING SPORTING AND DANCING PICTURES
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
TO MAKE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS HIS LORDSHIP'S INTENTION TO DEMAND AND WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD RENDERED INEVITABLE
OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
SHE'S BEEN MAKING A PURSE FOR HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND GRUDGED ME A HUNDRED POUND TO GET ME OUT OF QUOD HE THEN FIERCELY AND INCOHERENTLY AND WITH AN AGITATION
AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAYERS WHICH SIR PITT READ TO THEM AND TO THE SERVANTS IN THEIR SUNDAY SUITS OR LIVERIES RANGED UPON CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISSING TEA URN
IN CURZON STREET BUT WITHOUT THE CARPET BAG AND PORTMANTEAU FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT AND WITH A VERY PUZZLED AND ODD FACE THEY WON'T GIVE EM UP
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
TO GO TO CHURCH THOUGH HER THOUGHTS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY ASTRAY DURING THE PERIOD OF FAMILY DEVOTION RAWDON CRAWLEY MEANWHILE HURRIED ON FROM GREAT GAUNT STREET AND KNOCKING AT THE GREAT
THAT I RESOLVED TO PROLONG MY STAY ON THE WATER AND FIXING THE RUDDER IN A DIRECT POSITION STRETCHED MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT CLOUDS HID THE MOON EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURE
BUT IN CLERVAL I SAW THE IMAGE OF MY FORMER SELF HE WAS INQUISITIVE AND ANXIOUS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND INSTRUCTION THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS WHICH HE OBSERVED WAS TO HIM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT
NOTHING COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE ALTERATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MY FEELINGS SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE DAEMON
ANY CARE OR BITTER RECOLLECTION I OFTEN REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIM ALLEGING ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT I MIGHT REMAIN ALONE I NOW ALSO BEGAN TO COLLECT THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR MY NEW CREATION
AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED AT AND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHES WHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONS OF MEN IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR
BUT AS HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON MIGHT BE FOLLOWED EVEN SOONER THAN HE NOW CONJECTURED BY HIS LONGER VOYAGE HE ENTREATED ME TO BESTOW AS MUCH OF MY SOCIETY ON HIM AS I COULD SPARE HE BESOUGHT ME THEREFORE
I MIGHT BE DRIVEN INTO THE WIDE ATLANTIC AND FEEL ALL THE TORTURES OF STARVATION OR BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE IMMEASURABLE WATERS THAT ROARED AND BUFFETED AROUND ME I HAD ALREADY BEEN OUT MANY HOURS
THAT I MAY STING WITH ITS VENOM MAN YOU SHALL REPENT OF THE INJURIES YOU INFLICT DEVIL CEASE AND DO NOT POISON THE AIR WITH THESE SOUNDS OF MALICE
AND ONE OF THESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED THIS I HIRED IT CONTAINED BUT TWO ROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLE PENURY THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED
LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THAT WAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIR ALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH
AND THE SUN ROSE FROM THE OCEAN MY FEELINGS BECAME CALMER IF IT MAY BE CALLED CALMNESS WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF RAGE SINKS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR
UNTIL MY EAR WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY THE PADDLING OF OARS NEAR THE SHORE AND A PERSON LANDED CLOSE TO MY HOUSE IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER I HEARD THE CREAKING OF MY DOOR AS IF SOME ONE ENDEAVOURED TO OPEN IT SOFTLY
AS MORTAL AS THAT OF CRIME I VISITED EDINBURGH WITH LANGUID EYES AND MIND AND YET THAT CITY MIGHT HAVE INTERESTED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BEING CLERVAL DID NOT LIKE IT SO WELL AS OXFORD
VEGETABLES AND BREAD WHEN THEY INDULGED IN SUCH LUXURIES AND EVEN FRESH WATER WAS TO BE PROCURED FROM THE MAINLAND WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT ON THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE WERE BUT THREE MISERABLE HUTS
TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID COME SIR YOU MUST FOLLOW ME TO MISTER KIRWIN'S TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF WHO IS MISTER KIRWIN WHY AM I TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF
YET STILL THE WORDS OF THE FIEND RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A DEATH KNELL THEY APPEARED LIKE A DREAM YET DISTINCT AND OPPRESSIVE AS A REALITY THE SUN HAD FAR DESCENDED
AND AMONG THESE MOUNTAINS I SHOULD SCARCELY REGRET SWITZERLAND AND THE RHINE BUT HE FOUND THAT A TRAVELLER'S LIFE IS ONE THAT INCLUDES MUCH PAIN AMIDST ITS ENJOYMENTS HIS FEELINGS ARE FOREVER ON THE STRETCH
AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OF DISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETS OF NATURAL HISTORY
WE DID NOT INTEND TO FOLLOW THE GREAT ROAD TO EDINBURGH BUT TO VISIT WINDSOR OXFORD MATLOCK AND THE CUMBERLAND LAKES RESOLVING TO ARRIVE AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS TOUR ABOUT THE END OF JULY
NAY A WISH THAT SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE FACT STOLE ACROSS ME I DESIRED THAT I MIGHT PASS MY LIFE ON THAT BARREN ROCK WEARILY IT IS TRUE
AND THE ONLY CHECK TO HIS ENJOYMENTS WAS MY SORROWFUL AND DEJECTED MIND I TRIED TO CONCEAL THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT DEBAR HIM FROM THE PLEASURES NATURAL TO ONE WHO WAS ENTERING ON A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UNDISTURBED BY
I SAW A LINE OF HIGH LAND TOWARDS THE SOUTH ALMOST SPENT AS I WAS
EVERY MOMENT I FEARED TO MEET MY PERSECUTOR SOMETIMES I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND FEARING TO RAISE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE OBJECT WHICH I SO MUCH DREADED TO BEHOLD
I PACKED UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE MATERIALS I HAD COLLECTED RESOLVING TO FINISH MY LABOURS IN SOME OBSCURE NOOK IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND WE QUITTED LONDON ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF MARCH
AND FILLED IT FOREVER WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE I WAS NOW ABOUT TO FORM ANOTHER BEING OF WHOSE DISPOSITIONS I WAS ALIKE IGNORANT SHE MIGHT BECOME TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE MALIGNANT THAN HER MATE AND DELIGHT FOR ITS OWN SAKE
MY MIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYES WERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS
BUT I WAS OVERCOME BY THE SENSATION OF HELPLESSNESS SO OFTEN FELT IN FRIGHTFUL DREAMS WHEN YOU IN VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FLY FROM AN IMPENDING DANGER AND WAS ROOTED TO THE SPOT PRESENTLY I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE PASSAGE
I WAS NOT SORRY I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MY PROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DAEMON'S DISAPPOINTMENT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCE ON MY RELATIVES
IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCH PEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
SO THAT IN TIME OF NEED IT MAY FILL UP ITS SKELETON BATTALIONS AND EMPTY SADDLE TROOPS THIS IS REAL WISDOM BE CAUSE THE AMERICAN ARMY AS AT PRESENT CONSTITUTED IS MADE UP OF TWENTY FIVE REGIMENTS INFANTRY TEN COMPANIES EACH
THE STATE OF UTAH CAN DO NEARLY ANYTHING IT PLEASES UNTIL THAT MUCH TO BE DESIRED HOUR WHEN THE GENTILE VOTE SHALL QUIETLY SWAMP OUT MORMONISM BUT THE GARRISON IS KEPT THERE IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS THE BIG
THE BOND BETWEEN THE STATES IS OF AN AMAZING TENUITY SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT ABSOLUTELY MARCH INTO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SIT ON THE WASHINGTON STATUES AND INVENT A FLAG OF THEIR OWN
IT IS NOT SEEMLY FOR A FREE AND INDEPENDENT CITIZEN TO DUB HIMSELF A GENTILE BUT THE MAYOR OF OGDEN WHICH IS THE GENTILE CITY OF THE VALLEY TOLD ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO FLOCKS LONG BEFORE THE FRUIT ORCHARDS OF LOGAN
THE DROPPED H BETRAYED HER AND WHEN DID YOU LEAVE ENGLAND I SAID SUMMER OF EIGHTY FOUR
SHE MEANT TO GET HER PACKING DONE IN RECORD TIME AND ESCAPE FROM THIS PLACE SHE WENT INTO HER BEDROOM AND BEGAN TO THROW THINGS UNTIDILY INTO HER TRUNK
WILLIAM BANNISTER MADE NO MORE OBJECTIONS HE ATTACKED HIS MEAL WITH AN EASY CONSCIENCE
WHILE MAMIE IN A COTTON FROCK CALLED CHEERFULLY TO HIM TO COME IN BECAUSE BREAKFAST WAS READY AND GETTING COLD MAMIE AH HIS SIGH TURNED INTO A YAWN
BUT FOR THE CERTAINTY THAT UGLY PERSONS ARE JUST AS IRRATIONAL IN THE MATTER OF UNDIVIDED LOVE AS THE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMS THAT POLYGAMY WAS A BLESSED INSTITUTION FOR THE WOMEN AND THAT ONLY THE DREAD THREATS OF THE SPIRITUAL POWER
COME IN TO TRADE WITH THE ZION MERCANTILE CO OPERATIVE INSTITUTE THE CHURCH I FANCY LOOKS AFTER THE FINANCES OF THIS THING AND IT CONSEQUENTLY PAYS GOOD DIVIDENDS THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE NOT LOVELY IN DEED
YOU HAVE A FIRST CLASS ENGINE FOR PIONEER WORK THE TAWDRY MYSTICISM AND THE BORROWING FROM FREEMASONRY SERVE THE LOW CASTE SWEDE AND DANE THE WELSHMAN AND THE CORNISH COTTER JUST AS WELL AS A HIGHLY ORGANIZED HEAVEN
HIS EARNEST CONCENTRATION ON THE MAIN PLANK OF HIS PLATFORM THE SPIRITING AWAY OF WILLIAM BANNISTER HAD CAUSED HIM TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT NO PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO WELCOME HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL AT HIS DESTINATION
WAS BEING GRADUALLY SOLVED BY THE BALLOT AND BY EDUCATION ALL THE BEAUTY OF THE VALLEY COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET IT AND THE VALLEY IS VERY FAIR BENCH AFTER BENCH OF LAND
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE WHERE ARE WE HERE IN CONNECTICUT WHY STEVE RAISED A PROTESTING HAND NOT SO EARLY IN THE DAY KID NOT BEFORE BREAKFAST HE PLEADED HONEST I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
WITH A DEEP SIGH OF REPLETION STEVE MEANWHILE HAD ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SAY
A GLANCE HAD TOLD HER THAT IT WAS FROM HER FRIEND POLLY COUNTESS OF WETHERBY
IT OUGHT TO MAKE THE FINEST SCIENTIFIC AND SURVEY CORPS THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN IT DOES EXCELLENT WORK NOW BUT THERE IS THIS DEFECT IN ITS NATURE IT IS OFFICERED AS YOU KNOW FROM WEST POINT THE MISCHIEF OF IT IS
THEN I WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND PEEPED INTO PEOPLE'S FRONT WINDOWS AND THE DECORATIONS UPON THE TABLES WERE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY MAIN STREET WAS FULL OF COUNTRY FOLK FROM THE DESERT
STEVE MADE UP A SIMILAR NEST FOR HIMSELF AND REMOVING HIS COAT AND SHOES CRAWLED UNDER THE BLANKETS FIVE MINUTES LATER RHYTHMICAL SNORES PROCLAIMED THE FACT THAT NATURE HAD TRIUMPHED OVER ALL THE DISCOMFORTS OF ONE OF THE WORST MADE BEDS IN CONNECTICUT
SHARK MOUTHED PIG EARED HEAVY BONED FARMERS SOMETIMES TAKE TO THEIR CREED WITH WILDEST FANATICISM AND IN PAST YEARS HAVE MADE LIFE EXCESSIVELY UNPLEASANT FOR THE GENTILE WHEN HE WAS FEW IN THE LAND
WHERE HE IS CONSTANTLY MEETING SNAKES AND MONKEYS WITHOUT WARNING CHOOSE BETWEEN ME AND
CONFIDED TO ME THAT SHE HATED THE IDEA OF SALT LAKE CITY BEING TURNED INTO A SHOW PLACE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE GENTILES
STEVE HAVING DISPOSED OF TWO EGGS IN QUICK SUCCESSION
HIT THE HAY THERE WAS THE WHITE HOPE'S BED TO BE MADE AND BY THE WAY OF A PRELIMINARY TO THAT SHEETS MUST BE FOUND AND BLANKETS
WATCHING THE BOILING CABBAGE WOULD BE SINGING A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL HER MOTHER WOULD BE SIGHING AND HER LITTLE BROTHER PERCY WOULD BE EMPLOYED UPON SOME
OF COURSE IT'S THE TITLE THAT DOES IT LADY PAULINE WETHERBY ALGIE SAYS IT OUGHTN'T TO BE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE
HE'S NOT USED TO COUNTRY LIFE COME ALONG
I HAVE SOME PULL THESE DAYS BELIEVE ME NOT THAT YOU'LL NEED MY HELP
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER HOTEL TO WRITE A LETTER HOME NOTIFYING HER MOTHER OF HER PLANS SHE LOOKED AT HER WATCH IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK BACK IN WEST KENSINGTON A RICH SMELL OF DINNER WOULD BE FLOATING THROUGH THE FLAT THE COOK
AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING OF SOME KIND GOVERNED BY CODES WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND
IT'S ONE WAY OF FIXING EM WHAT'S FIXING INQUIRED WILLIAM BANNISTER BRIGHTLY STEVE SIGHED WHEN HE SPOKE HE WAS CALM BUT DETERMINED THAT'LL BE ALL THE DIALOGUE FOR THE PRESENT HE SAID WE'LL PLAY THE REST OF OUR ACT IN DUMB SHOW GET A MOVE ON YOU
HE CLIMBED IN AND UNLOCKED THE FRONT DOOR THEN HE CARRIED HIS YOUNG CHARGE INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND LAID HIM DOWN ON A CHAIR
TO TACK ON THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT TO HIS PAINTING HE'S DEVELOPED THE IDEA THAT HE HAS NERVES AND EVERYTHING UPSETS THEM THINGS CAME TO A HEAD THIS MORNING AT BREAKFAST CLARENCE MY SNAKE
HE'S ONE OF THEM RICH NEW YAWKERS HE HAS HIS SUMMER PLACE HERE
ALGIE KICKED FROM THE FIRST I OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT SINCE WE LEFT ENGLAND
THAT'S ONE THING GERMS NEVER DO EAT BREAD OUT OF CRINKLY PAPER
WITH BEARD UNCHECKED BY RAZOR
GOT NEXT TO YOUR MEANINGS IN A SECOND I PASS
AND FOUND HIM EYEING A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK IN A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
ITS FUTURE NECESSITIES ADMIT NOT OF CALCULATION OR LIMITATION AND UPON THE PRINCIPLE MORE THAN ONCE ADVERTED TO THE POWER OF MAKING PROVISION FOR THEM AS THEY ARISE OUGHT TO BE EQUALLY UNCONFINED
IS A POINT AGREED AMONG GEOMETRICIANS THOUGH NOT LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO COMMON SENSE THAN ANY OF THOSE MYSTERIES IN RELIGION AGAINST WHICH THE BATTERIES OF INFIDELITY HAVE BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY LEVELED BUT IN THE SCIENCES OF MORALS AND POLITICS
TO PILLAGE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY AND IN TURN SQUEEZES OUT OF THEM THE SUMS OF WHICH HE STANDS IN NEED TO SATISFY HIS OWN EXIGENCIES AND THOSE OF THE STATE IN AMERICA FROM A LIKE CAUSE
THE NATURAL CONCLUSION IS THAT SUCH CONTESTS WILL BE MOST APT TO END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE UNION AND THAT THERE IS GREATER PROBABILITY OF ENCROACHMENTS BY THE MEMBERS UPON THE FEDERAL HEAD THAN BY THE FEDERAL HEAD UPON THE MEMBERS
THOSE WHO HAVE CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO ITS VICES AND DEFORMITIES AS THEY HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED BY EXPERIENCE OR DELINEATED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS MUST FEEL INVINCIBLE REPUGNANCY TO TRUSTING THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IN ANY DEGREE TO ITS OPERATION
ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THE NATURAL CONCEPTIONS WHICH THE MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE LED TO ENTERTAIN UPON THE SUBJECT THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER OR IN OTHER WORDS THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF A FINITE THING
AND WOULD SUBJECT THEM ENTIRELY TO THE MERCY OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AS THE LAWS OF THE UNION ARE TO BECOME THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AS IT IS TO HAVE POWER TO PASS ALL LAWS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE AUTHORITIES WITH WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO VEST IT
I BELIEVE IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A POSITION WARRANTED BY THE HISTORY OF MANKIND THAT IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES
IF THE PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BE FOUND UPON AN IMPARTIAL EXAMINATION OF IT TO BE SUCH AS TO AFFORD TO A PROPER EXTENT THE SAME SPECIES OF SECURITY ALL APPREHENSIONS ON THE SCORE OF USURPATION OUGHT TO BE DISCARDED
TO IMAGINE THAT AT SUCH A CRISIS CREDIT MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF INFATUATION IN THE MODERN SYSTEM OF WAR NATIONS THE MOST WEALTHY ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LARGE LOANS
THAT EVERY POWER OUGHT TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH ITS OBJECT THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE NO LIMITATION OF A POWER DESTINED TO EFFECT A PURPOSE WHICH IS ITSELF INCAPABLE OF LIMITATION AND THERE ARE OTHER TRUTHS IN THE TWO LATTER SCIENCES WHICH
BY AN ACT WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT NO RELIANCE COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEADINESS OF ITS MEASURES FOR PAYING THE LOANS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE WOULD BE AS LIMITED IN THEIR EXTENT AS BURDENSOME IN THEIR CONDITIONS
AND THE FORMER ARE AT LEAST OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE LATTER TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE IT IS THEREFORE AS NECESSARY THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMMAND THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING THEIR WANTS
WE MAY BRING OURSELVES TO A STATE OF ABSOLUTE SCEPTICISM AND IRRESOLUTION I REPEAT HERE WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED IN SUBSTANCE IN ANOTHER PLACE THAT ALL OBSERVATIONS FOUNDED UPON THE DANGER OF USURPATION
CONSIDERED AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY POLITIC AS THAT WHICH SUSTAINS ITS LIFE AND MOTION AND ENABLES IT TO PERFORM ITS MOST ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS A COMPLETE POWER THEREFORE TO PROCURE A REGULAR AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF IT
UNASSISTED BY ANY ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS OR ILLUSTRATIONS BUT WE FIND IN FACT THAT THE ANTAGONISTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN THEIR JUSTNESS OR TRUTH
HOW ELSE COULD IT HAPPEN IF WE ADMIT THE OBJECTORS TO BE SINCERE IN THEIR OPPOSITION THAT POSITIONS SO CLEAR AS THOSE WHICH MANIFEST THE NECESSITY OF A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION SHOULD HAVE TO ENCOUNTER ANY ADVERSARIES AMONG MEN OF DISCERNMENT
THE HALCYON SCENES OF THE POETIC OR FABULOUS AGE BUT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A COMMON PORTION OF THE VICISSITUDES AND CALAMITIES WHICH HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF OTHER NATIONS THEY MUST APPEAR ENTITLED TO SERIOUS ATTENTION
AND THUS ALL THE RESOURCES OF TAXATION MIGHT BY DEGREES BECOME THE SUBJECTS OF FEDERAL MONOPOLY TO THE ENTIRE EXCLUSION AND DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
IT MAY THEREFORE BE SATISFACTORY TO ANALYZE THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THEY COMBAT IT THOSE OF THEM WHICH HAVE BEEN MOST LABORED WITH THAT VIEW SEEM IN SUBSTANCE TO AMOUNT TO THIS IT IS NOT TRUE
AS REVENUE IS THE ESSENTIAL ENGINE BY WHICH THE MEANS OF ANSWERING THE NATIONAL EXIGENCIES MUST BE PROCURED THE POWER OF PROCURING THAT ARTICLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPREHENDED IN THAT OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE EXIGENCIES
INGENIOUS MEN MAY DECLAIM WITH PLAUSIBILITY ON ANY SUBJECT BUT NO HUMAN INGENUITY CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER EXPEDIENT TO RESCUE US FROM THE INCONVENIENCES AND EMBARRASSMENTS NATURALLY RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE SUPPLIES OF THE PUBLIC TREASURY
THEY WOULD BE MADE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT USURERS COMMONLY LEND TO BANKRUPT AND FRAUDULENT DEBTORS WITH A SPARING HAND AND AT ENORMOUS PREMIUMS IT MAY PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT FROM THE SCANTINESS OF THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
AND HAS BEEN AMPLY UNFOLDED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THESE INQUIRIES IT IS THIS WHICH HAS CHIEFLY CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCE US TO A SITUATION WHICH AFFORDS AMPLE CAUSE BOTH OF MORTIFICATION TO OURSELVES
A COUNTRY SO LITTLE OPULENT AS OURS MUST FEEL THIS NECESSITY IN A MUCH STRONGER DEGREE BUT WHO WOULD LEND TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PREFACED ITS OVERTURES FOR BORROWING
IN THE OTTOMAN OR TURKISH EMPIRE THE SOVEREIGN THOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS ABSOLUTE MASTER OF THE LIVES AND FORTUNES OF HIS SUBJECTS HAS NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE A NEW TAX THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE PERMITS THE BASHAWS OR GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES
BUT THERE I GROW HOT FOR NOTHING AT ALL I EXPLAIN MYSELF I THINK AND GOD KNOWS IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU LORD JULIAN FOR YOUR KINDLY INTENTIONS I AM SO BUT YE'LL UNDERSTAND PERHAPS
ISN'T TO BE JUDGED BY ORDINARY RULES HE'S CHIVALROUS TO THE POINT OF IDIOCY AND YET HE HAS BEEN WHAT HE HAS BEEN
THEY MUST SUBMIT TO THE COMMANDS OF THEIR LEADER AND BECAUSE OF THE SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE WHICH HAD ATTENDED HIS LEADERSHIP HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO IMPOSE THAT STERN CONDITION OF A DISCIPLINE UNKNOWN BEFORE AMONG BUCCANEERS
OR OF MY LORD SUNDERLAND SINCE HE'S YOUR KINSMAN FOR HAVING THE IMPUDENCE TO SEND IT
THAT IS HOW YOU WILL REASON NOT SO HOWEVER REASONED CAPTAIN BLOOD INDEED THAT NIGHT HE REASONED NOT AT ALL HIS SOUL WAS GIVEN UP TO CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ALMOST SACRED LOVE HE HAD BORNE HER
DISENGAGED HIS ARM FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S AND STOOD SQUARELY BEFORE HIM YE'RE MY GUEST ABOARD THIS SHIP SAID HE
WHO HAD ALREADY DEPARTED MISS BISHOP DETAINED HIM WITH A QUESTION MISTER PITT SHE ASKED WERE YOU NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM BARBADOS WITH CAPTAIN BLOOD I WAS I TOO WAS ONE OF YOUR UNCLE'S SLAVES
IT'S WHAT YOU DESERVE OH AND WHY IF YOU PLEASE
HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT DISTURBED I DESIRE SIR THAT WE BE FRIENDS
MISS BISHOP'S SCORN WAS ALMOST FIERCE HIS LORDSHIP STARED AT HER AGAIN THEN HE HALF CLOSED HIS LARGE PALE EYES AND TILTED HIS HEAD A LITTLE I WONDER WHY YOU HATE HIM SO HE SAID SOFTLY
OH NO OFFENCE BUT
ESPECIALLY TO SEEK YOU YE'RE NOT BY ANY MEANS THE FIRST TO DO THAT THE OTHER SCOFFED
YE LOOK AS IF YE MIGHT LORD JULIAN STOOD STILL
AND BLOOD HELD HIM IN CHECK A GREAT MAN MISS BISHOP
CONVICTED HIM AND SENTENCED HIM IN THAT ONE PHRASE HE WAS THIEF AND PIRATE IN HER EYES NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS WHAT THEN WAS SHE WHAT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NO CHARITY HE ASKED THE STARS WELL
SINK ME WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT HE HAS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN YOU MAY MARVEL WITH ME THAT HE SHOULD TROUBLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SPANISH AND ENGLISH
HIS LORDSHIP LAUGHED SOFTLY FAITH
D'YE DREAM MAN WHAT IT IS TO BE A SLAVE HE CHECKED SUDDENLY AT THE VERY HEIGHT OF HIS PASSION
SAID LORD JULIAN AND ON THAT HE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND HIS MISSION
IN THAT AMAZEMENT HE LEFT HER AND WENT IN QUEST OF BLOOD BUT HE WAS STILL INTRIGUED
HIS LORDSHIP'S MIND WENT SWIFTLY BUT CAREFULLY DOWN THESE AVENUES OF THOUGHT OBSERVING AND CONNECTING HAVING EXHAUSTED THEM HE DECIDED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM MISS BISHOP FOR THIS HE MUST WAIT UNTIL PITT AND WOLVERSTONE SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN
BUT ALSO UPON THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIM
AND FOR THAT I WAS SOLD INTO SLAVERY BECAUSE BY THE LAW OF ENGLAND AS ADMINISTERED BY JAMES STUART IN VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF GOD WHO HARBOURS OR COMFORTS A REBEL IS HIMSELF ADJUDGED GUILTY OF REBELLION
I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND HER BROWS WERE KNIT HOW HAVE I BEEN UNGRATEFUL AND TO WHOM TO WHOM TO CAPTAIN BLOOD DIDN'T HE COME TO OUR RESCUE DID HE HER MANNER WAS FRIGID
I WASN'T AWARE THAT HE KNEW OF OUR PRESENCE ABOARD THE MILAGROSA HIS LORDSHIP PERMITTED HIMSELF THE SLIGHTEST GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT HE DELIVERED US SAID HE AND LIVING AS YOU HAVE DONE IN THESE SAVAGE PLACES OF THE WORLD
BY WHICH HE HAD SOUGHT TO STEER A COURSE PUT AN END TO THIS IDIOTIC STRUGGLE TO MAKE THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS SHE HAD SHOWN HIM CLEARLY TO WHICH WORLD HE BELONGED LET HIM NOW JUSTIFY HER SHE WAS ABOARD HIS SHIP
YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO BE AWARE OF WHAT IS KNOWN EVEN IN ENGLAND THAT THIS FELLOW BLOOD STRICTLY CONFINES HIMSELF TO MAKING WAR UPON THE SPANIARDS SO THAT TO CALL HIM THIEF AND PIRATE AS YOU DID WAS TO OVERSTATE THE CASE AGAINST HIM
MISS BISHOP RAISED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL THEN HER LIP FLICKERED CURIOUSLY
HAD SUPPLIED THE FINAL IMPULSE TO DRIVE HIM UPON HIS ROVER'S COURSE THAT HE SHOULD EVER MEET HER AGAIN HAD NOT ENTERED HIS CALCULATIONS HAD FOUND NO PLACE IN HIS DREAMS THEY WERE HE CONCEIVED IRREVOCABLY
PITT'S EYEBROWS WENT UP STILL HE ANSWERED
THAT IS NOT INTENDED YOUR FOLLOWERS WILL BE INCLUDED IN YOUR COMMISSION
THIEF AND PIRATE SHE HAD BRANDED HIM SHE SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED
HE HAD OBSERVED FOR INSTANCE THAT BLOOD'S SHIP WAS NAMED THE ARABELLA AND HE KNEW THAT ARABELLA WAS MISS BISHOP'S NAME AND HE HAD OBSERVED ALL THE ODD
THAT'S MIGHTY CONDESCENDING OF YOU
HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT SO DOES THE DISPLAY OF INGRATITUDE A FAINT COLOUR STIRRED IN HER CHEEKS YOUR LORDSHIP IS EVIDENTLY AGGRIEVED WITH ME I AM DISCONSOLATE I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP'S GRIEVANCE IS SOUNDER THAN YOUR VIEWS OF LIFE
WHO WAS BLOOD'S LIEUTENANT BOTH OF WHOM HAD SHOWN THEM THE UTMOST COURTESY ALSO THERE WAS THE FACT THAT BLOOD HIMSELF HAD KEPT ALMOST STUDIOUSLY FROM INTRUDING UPON THEM
HOW WOULD NOT THESE MEN LAUGH AT HIM NOW IF HE WERE TO TELL THEM THAT THIS HE HAD DONE OUT OF RESPECT FOR A SLIP OF A GIRL OF WHOM HE HAD FALLEN ROMANTICALLY ENAMOURED
OR EVEN A MAN I LIKED AS WELL YET THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH HIM SO I HEARD SHE ADMITTED IN A SMALL VOICE SHE WAS VERY WHITE AND SHE KEPT HER EYES UPON HER FOLDED HANDS
AND TO A DAMNED COLONIAL PLANTER
STIPULATED IN THEIR ARTICLES
BUT THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION SHE RECOVERED HATE HIM LORD WHAT A THOUGHT I DON'T REGARD THE FELLOW AT ALL THEN YE SHOULD MA'AM HIS LORDSHIP SPOKE HIS THOUGHT FRANKLY
BEND OVER IT EXAMINE IT TAKE A SPOONFUL AND HOLD IT TO THE LIGHT WHAT IS IT A BEETLE GRIGORY WOULD ASK A FLY PERHAPS OBSERVED MARFA THE SQUEAMISH YOUTH NEVER ANSWERED
AND COULD TELL FROM THE SOUND OF IT THAT HIS FATHER HAD ONLY REACHED THE GOOD HUMORED STAGE AND WAS FAR FROM BEING COMPLETELY DRUNK HERE HE IS HERE HE IS YELLED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HIGHLY DELIGHTED AT SEEING ALYOSHA JOIN US SIT DOWN
HE SPENT SOME YEARS THERE AND CAME BACK REMARKABLY CHANGED IN APPEARANCE HE LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY OLD FOR HIS AGE HIS FACE HAD GROWN WRINKLED YELLOW AND STRANGELY EMASCULATE IN CHARACTER HE SEEMED ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
THIS WAY BY THIS GATE AND STRAIGHT ACROSS THE COPSE THE COPSE COME WITH ME WON'T YOU I'LL SHOW YOU I HAVE TO GO I AM GOING MYSELF THIS WAY THIS WAY THEY CAME OUT OF THE GATE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE COPSE
NOW WE'VE A TREAT FOR YOU IN YOUR OWN LINE TOO IT'LL MAKE YOU LAUGH BALAAM'S ASS HAS BEGUN TALKING TO US HERE AND HOW HE TALKS HOW HE TALKS BALAAM'S ASS IT APPEARED WAS THE VALET SMERDYAKOV HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FOUR AND TWENTY
SENT FOR A DOCTOR AND TRIED REMEDIES BUT THE DISEASE TURNED OUT TO BE INCURABLE THE FITS OCCURRED ON AN AVERAGE ONCE A MONTH BUT AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FITS VARIED TOO IN VIOLENCE SOME WERE LIGHT AND SOME WERE VERY SEVERE
AND WOULD WANDER ABOUT THE ROOM AT NIGHT OR SIT IN AN ARM CHAIR THINKING THIS HAD BECOME A HABIT WITH HIM HE OFTEN SLEPT QUITE ALONE IN THE HOUSE SENDING HIS SERVANTS TO THE LODGE BUT USUALLY SMERDYAKOV REMAINED SLEEPING ON A BENCH IN THE HALL
CHAPTER SIX SMERDYAKOV HE DID IN FACT FIND HIS FATHER STILL AT TABLE THOUGH THERE WAS A DINING ROOM IN THE HOUSE THE TABLE WAS LAID AS USUAL IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS THE LARGEST ROOM
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PREPARING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY MIUESOV WITH WHOM HE WAS STAYING FOR THE TIME WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO ABROAD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH OR JENA THE YOUNG MAN WAS STILL UNDECIDED HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND ABSENT MINDED
ACH WHAT FINE GENTLEMEN'S AIRS GRIGORY MUTTERED LOOKING AT HIM WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IN SMERDYAKOV HE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIM HIS COOK AND SENT HIM TO MOSCOW TO BE TRAINED
THEY SAY HE USED TO JUMP UP AND THRASH EVEN LADIES WITH A STICK OBSERVED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AS HE WENT UP THE STEPS THE ELDER VARSONOFY DID SOMETIMES SEEM RATHER STRANGE BUT A GREAT DEAL THAT'S TOLD IS FOOLISHNESS HE NEVER THRASHED ANY ONE ANSWERED THE MONK NOW GENTLEMEN
MAXIMOV A MAN OF SIXTY RAN RATHER THAN WALKED TURNING SIDEWAYS TO STARE AT THEM ALL WITH AN INCREDIBLE DEGREE OF NERVOUS CURIOSITY HIS EYES LOOKED STARTING OUT OF HIS HEAD YOU SEE
AND SANG AND WAVED SOME OBJECT OVER THE DEAD CAT AS THOUGH IT WERE A CENSER ALL THIS HE DID ON THE SLY WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY
BUT FOR LADIES OF HIGHER RANK TWO ROOMS HAVE BEEN BUILT ADJOINING THE PORTICO BUT OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS YOU CAN SEE THE WINDOWS AND THE ELDER GOES OUT TO THEM BY AN INNER PASSAGE WHEN HE IS WELL ENOUGH THEY ARE ALWAYS OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS
ALYOSHA LET ME GIVE YOU MY BLESSING A FATHER'S BLESSING ALYOSHA ROSE BUT FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD ALREADY CHANGED HIS MIND NO NO HE SAID I'LL JUST MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER YOU FOR NOW SIT STILL
AND NOT ONE WOMAN GOES IN AT THIS GATE THAT'S WHAT IS REMARKABLE AND THAT REALLY IS SO BUT I DID HEAR THAT THE ELDER RECEIVES LADIES HE REMARKED SUDDENLY TO THE MONK WOMEN OF THE PEOPLE ARE HERE TOO NOW LYING IN THE PORTICO THERE WAITING
AT ONE O'CLOCK NOT LATER AND YOU ALSO HE ADDED ADDRESSING MAXIMOV THAT I CERTAINLY WILL WITHOUT FAIL CRIED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HUGELY DELIGHTED AT THE INVITATION AND BELIEVE ME WE'VE ALL GIVEN OUR WORD TO BEHAVE PROPERLY HERE
OUR VISITORS WERE AT ONCE SURROUNDED BY BEGGARS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT YOUNG KALGANOV WHO TOOK A TEN COPECK PIECE OUT OF HIS PURSE AND NERVOUS AND EMBARRASSED GOD KNOWS WHY HURRIEDLY GAVE IT TO AN OLD WOMAN SAYING DIVIDE IT EQUALLY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM YET HE USED SOMETIMES TO STOP SUDDENLY IN THE HOUSE OR EVEN IN THE YARD OR STREET AND WOULD STAND STILL FOR TEN MINUTES LOST IN THOUGHT A PHYSIOGNOMIST STUDYING HIS FACE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO THOUGHT IN IT
CHAPTER ONE THEY ARRIVE AT THE MONASTERY IT WAS A WARM BRIGHT DAY AT THE END OF AUGUST THE INTERVIEW WITH THE ELDER HAD BEEN FIXED FOR HALF PAST ELEVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER LATE MASS OUR VISITORS DID NOT TAKE PART IN THE SERVICE
SO THE BOOKCASE WAS CLOSED AGAIN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MARFA AND GRIGORY REPORTED TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH THAT SMERDYAKOV WAS GRADUALLY BEGINNING TO SHOW AN EXTRAORDINARY FASTIDIOUSNESS HE WOULD SIT BEFORE HIS SOUP TAKE UP HIS SPOON AND LOOK INTO THE SOUP
THOUGH OF LATE HE HAS BEEN SO WEAK THAT HE HAS HARDLY SHOWN HIMSELF EVEN TO THE PEOPLE SO THEN THERE ARE LOOPHOLES AFTER ALL TO CREEP OUT OF THE HERMITAGE TO THE LADIES DON'T SUPPOSE HOLY FATHER THAT I MEAN ANY HARM
THOUGH ONE OF THEM HAD RECENTLY MADE A DONATION OF A THOUSAND ROUBLES WHILE ANOTHER WAS A VERY WEALTHY AND HIGHLY CULTURED LANDOWNER UPON WHOM ALL IN THE MONASTERY WERE IN A SENSE DEPENDENT AS A DECISION OF THE LAWSUIT MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT PUT THEIR FISHING RIGHTS IN HIS HANDS
A WEEK LATER HE HAD HIS FIRST ATTACK OF THE DISEASE TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE EPILEPSY WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF IT HIS ATTITUDE TO THE BOY SEEMED CHANGED AT ONCE TILL THEN HE HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF HIM
IN THE CORNER OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE WERE SEVERAL IKONS BEFORE WHICH A LAMP WAS LIGHTED AT NIGHTFALL NOT SO MUCH FOR DEVOTIONAL PURPOSES AS TO LIGHT THE ROOM FYODOR PAVLOVITCH USED TO GO TO BED VERY LATE AT THREE OR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AND EXPECTATIONS OF MUCH MORE HE WAS A FRIEND OF ALYOSHA'S IN AN ANCIENT JOLTING BUT ROOMY HIRED CARRIAGE WITH A PAIR OF OLD PINKISH GRAY HORSES A LONG WAY BEHIND MIUESOV'S CARRIAGE
I MUST TAKE OFFICE TWO THE MASTER SAID
THESE ARE THE FOUR USEFUL BRANCHES OF MILITARY KNOWLEDGE WHICH ENABLED THE YELLOW EMPEROR TO VANQUISH FOUR SEVERAL SOVEREIGNS ELEVEN ALL ARMIES PREFER HIGH GROUND TO LOW
AND REMAIN FACING OURS FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT EITHER JOINING BATTLE OR TAKING THEMSELVES OFF AGAIN THE SITUATION IS ONE THAT DEMANDS GREAT VIGILANCE AND CIRCUMSPECTION FORTY
THE MASTER SAID
I HAVE HEARD SUCH WORDS
THEY WILL RARELY LAST FOR FIVE GENERATIONS
I HATE THE STRAINS OF CHENG CONFOUNDERS OF SWEET MUSIC I HATE A SHARP TONGUE THE RUIN OF KINGDOM AND HOME NINETEEN
EIGHTEEN THE MASTER SAID
SEVEN CONFUCIUS SAID A GENTLEMAN HAS THREE THINGS TO GUARD AGAINST IN THE DAYS OF THY YOUTH ERE THY STRENGTH IS STEADY
ALL OUR AVAILABLE STRENGTH KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THE ENEMY AND OBTAIN REINFORCEMENTS FORTY ONE HE WHO EXERCISES NO FORETHOUGHT BUT MAKES LIGHT OF HIS OPPONENTS
THE MASTER SAID A GENTLEMAN IS CALM AND SPACIOUS
HE SHOT BUT NOT AT BIRDS SITTING
TO THE ATTACK ARE SIGNS THAT HE WILL RETREAT TWENTY FIVE WHEN THE LIGHT CHARIOTS COME OUT FIRST AND TAKE UP A POSITION ON THE WINGS IT IS A SIGN THAT THE ENEMY
IN ITS ONWARD MARCH DO NOT ADVANCE TO MEET IT IN MID STREAM IT WILL BE BEST TO LET HALF THE ARMY GET ACROSS AND THEN DELIVER YOUR ATTACK FIVE
IT BETOKENS THE APPROACH OF INFANTRY WHEN IT BRANCHES OUT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IT SHOWS THAT PARTIES HAVE BEEN SENT TO COLLECT FIREWOOD A FEW CLOUDS OF DUST MOVING TO AND FRO SIGNIFY THAT THE ARMY
OVER THE CAMP FIRES SHOWING THAT THEY WILL NOT RETURN TO THEIR TENTS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH THIRTY FIVE
SOLDIERS MUST BE TREATED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WITH HUMANITY BUT KEPT UNDER CONTROL BY MEANS OF IRON DISCIPLINE THIS IS A CERTAIN ROAD TO VICTORY FORTY FOUR
YET DIGNIFIED
DIGNIFIED IN BEARING FAITHFUL OF SPEECH
THESE TWO THINGS I HAVE HEARD
WITH A GLIB TONGUE FIVE CONFUCIUS SAID
TWENTY NINE WHEN THE SOLDIERS STAND LEANING ON THEIR SPEARS THEY ARE FAINT
ASKED TZU LU ABOUT CONFUCIUS TZU LU DID NOT ANSWER
TO LIVE AS A GENTLEMAN IS NOT YET
GIVE THEM PEACE BUT NOW
THE RISING OF BIRDS IN THEIR FLIGHT IS THE SIGN OF AN AMBUSCADE STARTLED BEASTS INDICATE THAT A SUDDEN ATTACK IS COMING
THREE
SAID CONFUCIUS TRUTH EARNESTNESS AND KINDNESS MODESTY ESCAPES INSULT BOUNTY WINS THE MANY
WHEN THERE IS MUCH RUNNING ABOUT AND THE SOLDIERS FALL INTO RANK IT MEANS THAT THE CRITICAL MOMENT HAS COME TWENTY EIGHT WHEN SOME ARE SEEN ADVANCING AND SOME RETREATING
LOVE OF TRUTH WITHOUT LOVE OF LEARNING SINKS INTO CRUELTY LOVE OF
TOO FREQUENT REWARDS SIGNIFY THAT THE ENEMY IS AT THE END OF HIS RESOURCES TOO MANY PUNISHMENTS BETRAY A CONDITION OF DIRE DISTRESS THIRTY SEVEN
PASS QUICKLY OVER MOUNTAINS AND KEEP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF VALLEYS TWO CAMP IN HIGH PLACES FACING THE SUN DO NOT CLIMB HEIGHTS IN ORDER TO FIGHT SO MUCH
TO TASK THE MIND COULD HE NOT PLAY AT CHEQUERS
IF OUR TROOPS ARE NO MORE IN NUMBER THAN THE ENEMY THAT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT IT ONLY MEANS THAT NO DIRECT ATTACK CAN BE MADE WHAT WE CAN DO IS SIMPLY TO CONCENTRATE
SHOULD BE TO GET OVER THEM QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY DELAY EIGHT IF FORCED TO FIGHT IN A SALT MARSH YOU SHOULD HAVE WATER AND GRASS NEAR YOU AND GET YOUR BACK TO A CLUMP OF TREES
FOUR IN HIS FREE MOMENTS THE MASTER WAS EASY AND CHEERFUL FIVE THE MASTER SAID HOW DEEP IS MY DECAY
THEY MUST BE CAREFULLY ROUTED OUT AND SEARCHED FOR THESE ARE PLACES WHERE MEN IN AMBUSH OR INSIDIOUS SPIES ARE LIKELY TO BE LURKING EIGHTEEN
TWENTY THREE WHEN THERE IS DUST RISING IN A HIGH COLUMN
POETRY WOULD RIPEN YOU TEACH YOU INSIGHT
AND FACING THE SUN DO NOT MOVE UP STREAM TO MEET THE ENEMY SO MUCH FOR RIVER WARFARE SEVEN IN CROSSING SALT MARSHES YOUR SOLE CONCERN
AND THE UPKEEP OF COURTESY OF ALL THESE
LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT LOVE OF LEARNING
YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LET ME BRING YOU OVER TO MY CONVICTION MY REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS HOPE HAD BEEN OF THE BEST BUT YOU DISAPPOINTED IT I FOUND YOU CHANGED
A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
IF A KOR WAS ALIVE THERE WERE A JEDDAK FOR US WHO SAYS THAT A KOR IS DEAD DEMANDED ONE OF THE CHIEFS WHERE IS HE THEN
NO SHADOW FALLS WITHIN THOSE CHAMBERS THAT IS NOT MARKED BY A HUNDRED EYES
THE OTHERS SHUDDERED AND YOU WENT NOT MAD THEY ASKED AM I MAD RETORTED I GOS AND YOU WILL GO AGAIN YES THEN INDEED YOU ARE MAD CRIED ONE
OF THE DETERMINATION OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES THIS ILLUSION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID JUST AS WE CANNOT AVOID PERCEIVING THAT THE SEA APPEARS TO BE HIGHER AT A DISTANCE THAN IT IS NEAR THE SHORE
HE IS NOT DEAD WHEN HE REVIVES HE WILL RETURN TO HIS QUARTERS WITH A FINE TALE OF HIS BRAVERY AND THERE WILL BE NONE TO IMPUGN HIS BOASTS
ARE ONLY TO BE FOUND IN A JUDGEMENT THAT IS IN THE RELATION OF AN OBJECT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING IN A COGNITION WHICH COMPLETELY HARMONIZES WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNDERSTANDING NO ERROR CAN EXIST
THE GATHOLIAN ESSAYED THE DANGEROUS ASCENT CLINGING TO THE CARVINGS WITH HANDS AND FEET HE WORKED HIMSELF SLOWLY ALOFT AVOIDING THE WINDOWS AND KEEPING UPON THE SHADOWY SIDE OF THE TOWER AWAY FROM THE LIGHT OF THURIA AND CLUROS
WITHIN THE RANGE OF HIS VISION THERE WAS NOTHING APPARENT THAT MIGHT CAUSE ALARM SLOWLY HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT UPON THE FLOOR BESIDE THE COUCH LAY THE THING
AS THE LOUD SCREAM WITH WHICH HIS OWN HAD MINGLED HAD BROKEN UPON THE STARTLED EARS OF THE WARRIORS WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO SPY UPON HIM
WHICH AUTHORIZES US TO OVERSTEP THEM IS CALLED TRANSCENDENT IF OUR CRITICISM CAN SUCCEED IN EXPOSING THE ILLUSION IN THESE PRETENDED PRINCIPLES
IN ACCEPTANCE OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WHERE IS THE PRINCESS TARA OF HELIUM ASKED GAHAN IS SHE SAFE SHE IS CONFINED IN THE TOWER OF THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS AWAITING THE CEREMONY THAT IS TO MAKE HER JEDDARA
I GO NOW TO SPEAK WITH TARA PRINCESS OF HELIUM
FOR UP THIS O TAR WOULD APPROACH HIS BRIDE ALONE AFTER A SHORT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE DEAD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THE HALL OF CHIEFS IT WAS THE CUSTOM
OR HIS VERACITY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD FIND THE SLAVE TURAN HE DID NOT VERY MUCH WANT TO FIND HIM FOR THOUGH O TAR WAS AN EXCELLENT SWORDSMAN AND A BRAVE WARRIOR IN PHYSICAL COMBAT
IT FOLLOWS THAT ERROR IS CAUSED SOLELY BY THE UNOBSERVED INFLUENCE OF THE SENSIBILITY UPON THE UNDERSTANDING AND THUS IT HAPPENS THAT THE SUBJECTIVE GROUNDS OF A JUDGEMENT AND ARE CONFOUNDED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF O MAI THE CRUEL HIS KNEES SHOOK BUT HE GATHERED ALL HIS MORAL FORCES AND GRIPPING HIS SWORD MORE TIGHTLY IN HIS TREMBLING FINGERS PREPARED TO LEAP ACROSS THE CHAMBER UPON THE HORRID APPARITION
WAS DARKER THAN THE CORRIDOR SO THAT HE COULD JUST INDISTINCTLY MAKE OUT THE OBJECTS IN THE ROOM
O TAR GOES TO THE CHAMBER OF O MAI THIS NIGHT IN SEARCH OF TURAN THE SLAVE HE SAID HE SORROWS THAT HIS WARRIORS HAVE NOT THE COURAGE FOR SO MEAN A DUTY AND THAT THEIR JEDDAK IS THUS COMPELLED
THIS MUST BE DONE BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
AND OUT UPON THE ROOF OF THAT PORTION OF THE PALACE FROM WHERE HE POINTED TO A HIGH TOWER QUITE CLOSE BY THERE HE SAID LIES THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM AND QUITE SAFE SHE WILL BE UNTIL THE TIME OF THE CEREMONY
THEN INDEED SHALL O TAR FALL THE NIGHT CAME AND THE ZODES DRAGGED AND THE TIME APPROACHED WHEN O TAR
BUT AGAIN CAME THE FEAR OF THE WRATH AND CONTEMPT OF HIS WARRIORS AND HIS CHIEFS THEY WOULD DEGRADE HIM AND THEY WOULD SLAY HIM INTO THE BARGAIN
INTO WHICH DIAMOND HEADED PINS WERE STUCK UNTIL THE WHOLE SCINTILLATED AS THE STARS IN HEAVEN UPON A MOONLESS NIGHT BUT IT WAS A SULLEN AND DEFIANT BRIDE THAT THEY LED FROM THE HIGH TOWER
MEN HAVE DIED FOR LESS THAN THAT ANCIENT ONE
WHAT AWFUL RISK IS THIS YOU TAKE TO SEEK ME HERE WHERE EVEN YOUR BRAVE HEART IS POWERLESS TO AID ME BE NOT SO SURE OF THAT HEART OF MY HEART HE REPLIED WHILE I BRING BUT WORDS TO MY LOVE
THE TOWER ROSE SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE ROOF OF THE ADJACENT PART OF THE PALACE COMPRISING FIVE LEVELS OR FLOORS WITH WINDOWS LOOKING IN EVERY DIRECTION A FEW OF THE WINDOWS WERE BALCONIED
COME LET US DRINK CRIED O TAR AND REACHED FOR THE DAGGER THE POMMEL OF WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE TO STRIKE THE GONG WHICH SUMMONED SLAVES BUT THE DAGGER WAS NOT IN ITS SCABBARD O TAR WAS PUZZLED
WITHOUT VESTIGE OF HOPE I STILL LIVE SHE WHISPERED INWARDLY IN A LAST BRAVE ATTEMPT TO COMBAT THE TERRIBLE HOPELESSNESS THAT WAS OVERWHELMING HER BUT HER FINGERS STOLE FOR REASSURANCE TO THE SLIM BLADE
US TO BREAK DOWN ALL THOSE BARRIERS AND TO LAY CLAIM TO A PERFECTLY NEW FIELD OF COGNITION WHICH RECOGNIZES NO LINE OF DEMARCATION THUS TRANSCENDENTAL AND TRANSCENDENT ARE NOT IDENTICAL TERMS
BUT DID NOT AWAKEN AGAIN HE CALLED BUT THIS TIME LOUDER TARA SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT AND AT THE SAME INSTANT A HUGE EUNUCH LEAPED TO HIS FEET FROM WHERE HE HAD BEEN LYING ON THE FLOOR
SECOND DIVISION TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC INTRODUCTION
I WILL FIND A WAY
HIS MAJESTY LISTENED TO ME WITH SOME SORT OF COMFORT AND WHEN I HAD DONE NEPHEW SAID HE WHAT YOU TELL ME GIVES ME SOME HOPE I KNEW THAT MY SON ORDERED THAT TOMB TO BE BUILT AND I CAN GUESS PRETTY NEARLY THE PLACE
OF HIS RESENTMENT BUT NOW THAT HE HAD ME IN HIS POWER HE EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS
BUT MUST I HAVE ALSO NEWS OF THE DEATH OF A BROTHER I LOVED SO DEARLY AND SEE YOU REDUCED TO THIS DEPLORABLE CONDITION HE TOLD ME HOW UNEASY HE WAS THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING OF HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ENQUIRY HE COULD MAKE
AND PUT OUT ONE OF HIS EYES AS SOON AS I UNDERSTOOD THIS I NOT ONLY SENT TO MAKE MY EXCUSE TO HIM BUT DID IT IN PERSON YET HE NEVER FORGAVE ME AND AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED MADE ME SENSIBLE
AND WOULD ABUSE OUR CONFIDENCE BUT WE HESITATE NOT TO DISCOVER IT TO THE PRUDENT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WITH THEM IT IS SAFE
WE ENTERED AND FOUND THE IRON TRAP PULLED DOWN AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRCASE
FROM THIS ANTECHAMBER WE CAME INTO ANOTHER VERY LARGE SUPPORTED BY COLUMNS AND LIGHTED BY SEVERAL BRANCHED CANDLESTICKS THERE WAS A CISTERN IN THE MIDDLE AND PROVISIONS OF SEVERAL SORTS STOOD ON ONE SIDE OF IT BUT WE WERE MUCH SURPRISED NOT TO SEE ANY PERSON
HE DID NOT INTIMATE WHO SHE WAS NEITHER DID I THINK IT WOULD BE POLITE TO ENQUIRE WE SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH THIS LADY AT TABLE WHERE WE CONTINUED SOME TIME CONVERSING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS
AT WHOSE COURT I AMUSED MYSELF FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN TO MY FATHER'S THESE JOURNEYS CEMENTED A FIRM AND INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE MY COUSIN AND MYSELF
AND THE EXCELLENT ORDER IN WHICH EVERY THING WAS PLACED BUT WHAT PARTICULARLY CAPTIVATED HIS ATTENTION WAS A THIRD LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SECOND AND WAS SEATED UPON THE THRONE JUST MENTIONED
TO SAY THAT I HAVE ALSO READ IN ANOTHER AUTHOR A MAXIM WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HAPPILY FOLLOWED WE CONCEAL OUR SECRET FROM SUCH PERSONS ONLY AS ARE KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD TO WANT DISCRETION
WHEN THE PORTER HAD PUT ALL THESE THINGS INTO HIS BASKET AND PERCEIVED THAT IT GREW FULL MY GOOD LADY SAID HE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN ME NOTICE THAT YOU HAD SO MUCH PROVISION TO CARRY AND THEN I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A HORSE OR RATHER A CAMEL FOR THE PURPOSE
WE DISGUISED OURSELVES AND WENT OUT BY A DOOR OF THE GARDEN WHICH OPENED INTO THE FIELDS AND SOON FOUND WHAT WE SOUGHT FOR I KNEW THE TOMB AND WAS THE MORE REJOICED BECAUSE I HAD FORMERLY SOUGHT IT A LONG TIME IN VAIN
SHE DESCENDED AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE TWO OTHERS AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM HE JUDGED BY THE RESPECT WHICH THE OTHER LADIES SHOWED HER THAT SHE WAS THE CHIEF IN WHICH HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
WHO WOULD NOT SUFFER SUCH AN ABOMINATION HAS JUSTLY PUNISHED THEM BOTH AT THESE WORDS HE MELTED INTO TEARS AND I JOINED MINE WITH HIS AFTER A WHILE CASTING HIS EYES UPON ME DEAR NEPHEW CRIED HE EMBRACING ME
AND WENT TO THE PUBLIC BURYING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL TOMBS LIKE THAT WHICH I HAD SEEN I SPENT THE DAY IN VIEWING THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT COULD NOT FIND THAT I SOUGHT FOR AND THUS I SPENT FOUR DAYS SUCCESSIVELY IN VAIN
AND NOW AND THEN FILLING A GLASS TO EACH OTHER'S HEALTH AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE SAID COUSIN WE MUST LOSE NO TIME THEREFORE PRAY OBLIGE ME BY TAKING THIS LADY ALONG WITH YOU AND CONDUCTING HER TO SUCH A PLACE
TAKE THIS JUG SAID THE LADY TO THE PORTER AND PUT IT IN YOUR BASKET THIS BEING DONE SHE COMMANDED HIM TO FOLLOW HER AND AS SHE PROCEEDED THE PORTER CONTINUED HIS EXCLAMATION O HAPPY DAY THIS IS A DAY OF AGREEABLE SURPRISE AND JOY
THIS REBEL VIZIER HAD LONG ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED AGAINST ME FOR THIS REASON
WHAT SURPRISED HIM MOST WAS THAT HE SAW NO MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE YET MOST OF THE PROVISIONS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AS THE DRY FRUITS AND THE SEVERAL SORTS OF CAKES AND CONFECTIONS WERE ADAPTED CHIEFLY FOR THOSE WHO COULD DRINK AND MAKE MERRY
THE SECRET WE MAY ENTRUST TO YOU BUT WE ALSO REQUIRE YOU TO ATTEND TO THE STRICTEST RULES OF GOOD MANNERS DURING THIS ADDRESS THE CHARMING AMENE PUT OFF THE APPAREL SHE WENT ABROAD WITH AND FASTENED HER ROBE TO HER GIRDLE THAT SHE MIGHT ACT WITH THE GREATER FREEDOM
AT THESE WORDS THE UNFORTUNATE FATHER BURST INTO TEARS AND WAS SO MUCH AFFLICTED THAT PITYING HIS GRIEF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO KEEP THE SECRET ANY LONGER SO THAT NOTWITHSTANDING MY OATH TO THE PRINCE MY COUSIN I TOLD THE SULTAN
AND THE ETERNAL DISGRACE HE WOULD BRING UPON MY FAMILY IF HE PERSISTED BUT I ALSO REPRESENTED THE SAME TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHUT HER UP SO CLOSE THAT SHE COULD HAVE NO CONVERSATION WITH HER BROTHER BUT THAT UNFORTUNATE CREATURE HAD SWALLOWED SO MUCH OF THE POISON
I COULD GET NOTHING FARTHER FROM HIM BUT WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE MY LEAVE AS I RETURNED TO MY UNCLE'S PALACE THE VAPOURS OF THE WINE GOT UP INTO MY HEAD HOWEVER I REACHED MY APARTMENT AND WENT TO BED
AND CAME TO HIS CAPITAL I GAVE HIM A LONG DETAIL OF THE TRAGICAL CAUSE OF MY RETURN AND OF THE SAD CONDITION HE SAW ME IN ALAS CRIED HE WAS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE LOST MY SON
AND LEAVE ME TO BE DEVOURED BY BIRDS OF PREY THE EXECUTIONER CONVEYED ME THUS SHUT UP INTO THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE BUT BY MY PRAYERS AND TEARS I MOVED THE MAN'S COMPASSION
YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING PREPARATIONS TO REGALE OURSELVES AND THAT AS YOU HAVE SEEN AT A CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE IT IS NOT JUST THAT YOU SHOULD NOW PARTAKE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TO THE COST
THAT HE HAD NEARLY SUFFERED HIS BASKET TO FALL FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BEAUTY THAT EQUALLED HER THE LADY WHO BROUGHT THE PORTER WITH HER PERCEIVING HIS DISORDER AND KNOWING THE CAUSE WAS GREATLY DIVERTED AND TOOK SO MUCH PLEASURE IN WATCHING HIS LOOKS
AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF THE APARTMENT UNSTAINED BY ORNAMENT AND SAW THAT THE ROOF WAS BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A CIRCULAR SHAFT FULL OF LIGHT
WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
SAID HE ARE POSSUMS FOUND ANYWHERE EXCEPT AROUND HERE INQUIRED HAPPY JACK YES INDEED REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY ARE FOUND ALL DOWN THROUGH THE SUNNY SOUTH
WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
AND HE DID TOO HE WAS THE DEADEST LOOKING THING I EVER SAW I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD MYSELF I WAS WATCHING FROM A BRAMBLE TANGLE WHERE I WAS HIDING AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT
AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
MUTUAL ENQUIRIES ON COMMON SUBJECTS PASSED NEITHER OF THEM PROBABLY MUCH THE WISER FOR WHAT THEY HEARD AND ANNE CONTINUING FULLY SENSIBLE OF HIS BEING LESS AT EASE THAN FORMERLY
AND ANNE WEARIED OF SUCH A STATE OF STAGNATION SICK OF KNOWING NOTHING AND FANCYING HERSELF STRONGER BECAUSE HER STRENGTH WAS NOT TRIED WAS QUITE IMPATIENT FOR THE CONCERT EVENING IT WAS A CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A PERSON PATRONISED BY LADY DALRYMPLE OF COURSE THEY MUST ATTEND
SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT
BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE SHELTER DESIRABLE FOR WOMEN AND QUITE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT VERY DESIRABLE FOR MISS ELLIOT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONVEYED HOME IN LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE WHICH WAS SEEN WAITING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE SHE ANNE AND MISSUS CLAY THEREFORE TURNED INTO MOLLAND'S
HE WAS MORE OBVIOUSLY STRUCK AND CONFUSED BY THE SIGHT OF HER THAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE HE LOOKED QUITE RED
HE FANCIED THAT IF HE WENT WITH US HE SHOULD FIND YOU CLOSE BY HE FANCIED EVERYBODY TO BE LIVING IN UPPERCROSS AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT LADY RUSSELL LIVED THREE MILES OFF HIS HEART FAILED HIM AND HE HAD NOT COURAGE TO COME THAT IS THE FACT UPON MY HONOUR MARY KNOWS IT IS
WITHOUT WONDERING WHETHER SHE MIGHT SEE HIM OR HEAR OF HIM CAPTAIN BENWICK CAME NOT HOWEVER
AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF LADY RUSSELL WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN FOR BATH SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE
CHARLES AND MARY ALSO CAME IN OF COURSE DURING THEIR VISIT AND MISTER MUSGROVE MADE A POINT OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO LADY RUSSELL AND SAT DOWN CLOSE TO HER FOR TEN MINUTES TALKING WITH A VERY RAISED VOICE BUT FROM THE CLAMOUR OF THE CHILDREN ON HIS KNEES GENERALLY IN VAIN IT WAS A FINE FAMILY PIECE
SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS READY TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN ACQUAINTANCE EXPECTING IT AND SHE HAD THE PAIN OF SEEING HER SISTER TURN AWAY WITH UNALTERABLE COLDNESS LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE FOR WHICH MISS ELLIOT WAS GROWING VERY IMPATIENT NOW DREW UP
CONCLUDED A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED HERSELF BY OBSERVING WITH A HAPPY GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH NOTHING WAS SO LIKELY TO DO HER GOOD AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS AT HOME LOUISA WAS NOW RECOVERING APACE
IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING MISSUS MUSGROVE WERE THE LITTLE HARVILLES WHOM SHE WAS SEDULOUSLY GUARDING FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE TWO CHILDREN FROM THE COTTAGE EXPRESSLY ARRIVED TO AMUSE THEM ON ONE SIDE WAS A TABLE OCCUPIED BY SOME CHATTERING GIRLS CUTTING UP SILK AND GOLD PAPER
SHE WAS YET PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS OF LADY RUSSELL'S EYES BEING TURNED EXACTLY IN THE DIRECTION FOR HIM OF HER BEING IN SHORT INTENTLY OBSERVING HIM SHE COULD THOROUGHLY COMPREHEND THE SORT OF FASCINATION HE MUST POSSESS OVER LADY RUSSELL'S MIND
AND AS TO HER YOUNG FRIEND'S HEALTH BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN
HER KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH INCLINED HER TO THINK THAT THE SACRIFICE OF ONE PAIR OF HORSES WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS
WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT
AND THOUGH A GREAT DEAL IS DUE TO THE FEELINGS OF THE GENTLEMAN AND THE HEAD OF A HOUSE LIKE YOUR FATHER THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH ANNE WANTED HER FATHER TO BE PROCEEDING HIS FRIENDS TO BE URGING HIM
SHE WAS LOST AND WHEN SHE HAD SCOLDED BACK HER SENSES SHE FOUND THE OTHERS STILL WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER ELLIOT ALWAYS OBLIGING JUST SETTING OFF FOR UNION STREET ON A COMMISSION OF MISSUS CLAY'S SHE NOW FELT A GREAT INCLINATION TO GO TO THE OUTER DOOR SHE WANTED TO SEE IF IT RAINED
AND INSINUATIONS HIGHLY RATIONAL AGAINST MISSUS CLAY BUT JUST NOW SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PRESENT FEELINGS WHETHER HE WERE REALLY SUFFERING MUCH FROM DISAPPOINTMENT OR NOT AND TILL THAT POINT WERE SETTLED SHE COULD NOT BE QUITE HERSELF
IF HE WOULD HAVE WALKED BY HER SIDE ALL THE WAY TO CAMDEN PLACE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
AND THEY HAD JUST REACHED THIS POINT WHEN ANNE AS SHE SAT NEAR THE WINDOW DESCRIED MOST DECIDEDLY AND DISTINCTLY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKING DOWN THE STREET HER START WAS PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF
WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE
IT WAS REALLY EXPECTED TO BE A GOOD ONE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH HIM AGAIN SHE FANCIED SHE SHOULD BE SATISFIED AND AS TO THE POWER OF ADDRESSING HIM SHE FELT ALL OVER COURAGE IF THE OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED
WHAT A VERY GOOD LOOKING MAN YES AND MISS ATKINSON WHO DINED WITH HIM ONCE AT THE WALLISES SAYS HE IS THE MOST AGREEABLE MAN SHE EVER WAS IN COMPANY WITH SHE IS PRETTY I THINK ANNE ELLIOT VERY PRETTY WHEN ONE COMES TO LOOK AT HER
LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT SIR WALTER TO DESCEND INTO A SMALL HOUSE IN HIS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD ANNE HERSELF WOULD HAVE FOUND THE MORTIFICATIONS OF IT MORE THAN SHE FORESAW
AND WHEN THEY DINED WITH THE HARVILLES THERE HAD BEEN ONLY A MAID SERVANT TO WAIT AND AT FIRST MISSUS HARVILLE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN MISSUS MUSGROVE PRECEDENCE BUT THEN SHE HAD RECEIVED SO VERY HANDSOME AN APOLOGY FROM HER ON FINDING OUT WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS
MARY HAD HAD HER EVILS BUT UPON THE WHOLE AS WAS EVIDENT BY HER STAYING SO LONG SHE HAD FOUND MORE TO ENJOY THAN TO SUFFER
THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
SLIP DOWN HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE OTHER MAN AND BRING THE HEADLIGHTS OFF THE CAR SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING DO YOU THINK
I HAD TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB BEFORE EVER I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE SUDDEN SCUFFLE AND FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS THE RELIEF OF HAVING HOLLINS'S REVOLVER WITHDRAWN FROM MY NOSE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MAISIE WAS CLOSE BY
AND AS HE HELD HIS BULL'S EYE BEFORE HIM ITS LIGHT FELL FULL ON HOLLINS AND HE JUMPED BACK
I THOUGHT I'D DIE SOMETHIN HIT ME ON THE FACE AND I SET UP SUDDEN AND THEN I SEEN THE PLASTER DROP DROPPIN FROM A LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW AN IRON BAR THAT LONG
BUT WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND HIM SEND WARNER FOR THE CAR BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM AT FOUR O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
MISTER HOLLINS I CRIED MISTER HOLLINS AND THEN I WAS FRIGHTENED STILL MORE FOR AS IF IN ANSWER TO MY SUMMONS BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF SOME MUSCULAR CONTRACTION FOLLOWING ON DEATH
AND WAS HOLDING A GLASS OF WATER TO MY LIPS THAT SHE SNATCHED UP FROM A TABLE AND ENCOURAGING ME WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSOLING HER
AND TURNED TO RUN BACK INTO THE ROOM WHERE WE HAD TALKED BUT AS I TURNED THERE WERE SOUNDS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR AND THE FLASH OF A BULL'S EYE LAMP AND I HEARD CHISHOLM'S VOICE DOWN IN THE GATEWAY BELOW HULLO UP THERE HE WAS DEMANDING
ABOVE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN HER EYES LOOKED BIG AND SOMBER AND THE RAPID DRIVE HAD BROUGHT NO COLOR TO HER FACE I GOT UP AND DREW FORWARD A CHAIR HE HAS NOT COME BACK I SAID QUIETLY SIT DOWN CHILD
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE TELEPHONE RANG IT WAS MISTER JAMIESON
YOU MAY HAVE DREAMED IT IN YOUR FAINTING ATTACK BUT IF IT IS TRUE THE METAL ROD AND THE HOLE IN THE WALL WILL SHOW IT ELIZA LOOKED A LITTLE BIT SHEEPISH
AND FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LITTLE ROOM AND LOOKED ROUND CURIOUSLY I LEFT THEM WHISPERING AND OPENED THE DOOR THAT HOLLINS HAD POINTED OUT THERE WAS A STAIR THERE AS HE HAD SAID SET DEEP IN THE THICK WALL
I TRIED TO WARN HIM NONSENSE I SAID
SIR GILBERT AND THAT BUTLER OF HIS HOLLINS SHE ANSWERED I TOOK THE SHORT CUT THROUGH THE GROUNDS HERE LAST NIGHT AND I RAN UPON THE TWO OF THEM AT THE CORNER OF THE RUINS AND THEY STOPPED ME AND WOULDN'T LET ME GO
IT WAS THE UNMISTAKABLE RUMBLE OF THE CASANOVA HACK GERTRUDE DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS IT'S THE HACK I AM SURE SHE SAID EVIDENTLY RELIEVED SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE CAR AND NO WONDER
BE LIKE SEARCHING A RABBIT WARREN YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP FROM THE TOWN AYE TO BE SURE HE AGREED BUT WE'LL TAKE A VIEW OF THINGS OURSELVES FIRST THERE MAY BE EFFECTS ON HIM THAT'LL SUGGEST SOMETHING
TO STIFLE HER WITH HOUSEHOLD AMMONIA AND LIDDY RUBBING HER WRISTS WHATEVER GOOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO I KNEW THAT THE GHOST HAD BEEN WALKING AGAIN AND THIS TIME IN DAYLIGHT ELIZA WAS IN A FRENZY OF FEAR
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CREAKING VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AT THE DOOR LOUISE ROSE AND STOOD WATCHING HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND THEN GERTRUDE OPENED THE DOOR ADMITTING MISTER JAMIESON AND A STOCKY MIDDLE AGED MAN
WHEN SHE CAME HOWEVER I COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN A GASP OF SURPRISE IT WAS THE WOMAN WITH THE PITTED FACE SHE STOOD SOMEWHAT AWKWARDLY JUST INSIDE THE DOOR AND SHE HAD AN AIR OF SELF CONFIDENCE THAT WAS INSPIRING
AND GERTRUDE ALWAYS APPREHENSIVE LATELY WAS AT THE DOOR ALMOST INSTANTLY A MOMENT LATER LOUISE HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD THERE BAREHEADED AND BREATHING HARD WHERE IS HALSEY SHE DEMANDED
OF COURSE I'M SURE SHE REPLIED WHO ELSE AND I MADE OUT THEY WERE AFRAID OF MY LETTING OUT THAT I'D SEEN THEM IT WAS SIR GILBERT HIMSELF SAID THEY COULD RUN NO RISKS YOU'VE SEEN HIM SINCE I ASKED
FRIGHTENED SHE'D LET OUT ON THEM IF SHE GOT AWAY THEN THE GLASGOW TALE WAS ALL LIES HE EXCLAIMED IT CAME FROM THIS MAN TOO THAT'S LYING DEAD IT'S BEEN A PUT UP THING D'YE THINK MISTER HUGH
AND HE LEFT ME AND HE WAS NO SOONER DOWN THE STAIRS HERE THAN I HEARD A BIT OF A SCUFFLE AND HIM FALL AND GROAN AND I RAN OUT TO FIND THAT AND SOMEBODY WAS OFF AND AWAY HAVE YOU SEEN NOBODY OUTSIDE THERE
IS THERE ANYBODY ABOVE IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS BURSTING MY CHEST WHEN I GOT AN ANSWER OUT TO HIM OH MAN I SHOUTED COME UP THERE'S ME HERE AND THERE'S MURDER
TAKE MY HORSE AND TRAP OUTSIDE AND DRIVE LIKE MAD TRY TO FIND THE DRAGON FLY IT OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER WAY ONLY DON'T LOSE A MOMENT THE NEW DETECTIVE HAD GONE AND A MOMENT LATER
HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MIND IF THE COOK SITS DOWN COMFORTABLY IN MY SITTING ROOM WHEN SHE IS TAKING THE ORDERS FOR THE DAY
YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS KIND OF THING I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN HEARD ME HE HAS NOT COME BACK SHE ASKED LOOKING FROM ME TO GERTRUDE
IT WAS THAT HE HAD CARRIED AWAY INTO DEATH AND WHY THAT QUEER AND PUZZLED EXPRESSION HAD CROSSED HIS FACE IN DEATH'S VERY MOMENT AND THAT DONE I RAN UP TO MAISIE AGAIN
I WATCHED GERTRUDE'S BRIGHT COLOR SLOWLY EBBING AWAY AND AROUND MY OWN HEART I SEEMED TO FEEL THE GRASP OF A GIANT HAND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN A SOUND BUT IT WAS NOT THE CHUG OF THE MOTOR
AND THAT NOBODY MAY HEAR US LET US SAID HE TAKE A WALK IN YOUR COURT AND SEEING NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW ON COMMAND YOUR DERVISES TO RETIRE TO THEIR CELLS THE CHIEF OF THE DERVISES DID AS HE WAS REQUIRED
AND BROKE INTO SEVERAL PIECES THE WOLF HAD IN THE MEANWHILE TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO A COCK AND NOW FELL TO PICKING UP THE SEEDS OF THE POMEGRANATE ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT FINDING NO MORE HE CAME TOWARDS US WITH HIS WINGS SPREAD
AND TAUGHT ME SEVENTY RULES OF MAGIC BY VIRTUE OF WHICH I CAN IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE TRANSPORT YOUR CAPITAL INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA OR BEYOND MOUNT CAUCASUS BY THIS SCIENCE I KNOW ALL ENCHANTED PERSONS AT FIRST SIGHT
YOU KNOW THE REMAINING PART MADAM
AFTER HE HAD GIVEN THIS CHARGE TO THE OFFICER HE BADE THE ENVIOUS MAN FAREWELL AND PROCEEDED ON HIS MARCH WHEN I HAD FINISHED THE RECITAL OF THIS STORY TO THE GENIE THE MURDERER OF THE PRINCESS OF THE ISLE OF EBENE
WHEREUPON THEY CLOTHED ME WITH THE RICH BROCADE ROBE AND CARRIED ME ASHORE WHERE THEY SET ME ON HORSEBACK WHILST THE SULTAN WAITED FOR ME AT HIS PALACE WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF COURTIERS WHOM HE GATHERED TOGETHER TO DO ME THE MORE HONOUR THE PROCESSION COMMENCED
CAME TO FAWN UPON HER MASTER AS SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO HE TOOK HER UP AND PULLED SEVEN HAIRS FROM THE WHITE SPOT THAT WAS UPON HER TAIL AND LAID THEM ASIDE FOR HIS USE WHEN OCCASION SHOULD SERVE SOON AFTER SUNRISE THE SULTAN
AND WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THEM HAD THEY NOT EXPLAINED SIR SAID THEY WE HUMBLY BEG YOUR MAJESTY'S PARDON THESE HANDS WERE NOT WRITTEN BY A MAN BUT BY AN APE WHAT DO YOU SAY EXCLAIMED THE SULTAN THOSE ADMIRABLE CHARACTERS
THEN THE TWO FIRES INCREASED WITH A THICK BURNING SMOKE WHICH MOUNTED SO HIGH THAT WE HAD REASON TO APPREHEND IT WOULD SET THE PALACE ON FIRE BUT WE VERY SOON HAD A MORE PRESSING OCCASION OF FEAR FOR THE GENIE HAVING GOT LOOSE FROM THE PRINCESS
HAS MALICIOUSLY DONE HIM THIS WRONG AFTER HAVING CRUELLY TAKEN AWAY THE LIFE OF THE PRINCESS OF THE ISLE OF EBENE THE SULTAN ASTONISHED AT THIS DECLARATION TURNED TOWARDS ME AND SPEAKING NO MORE BY SIGNS BUT IN PLAIN WORDS
THE SULTAN AND I EXPECTED BUT DEATH WHEN WE HEARD A CRY OF VICTORY VICTORY AND INSTANTLY THE PRINCESS APPEARED IN HER NATURAL SHAPE BUT THE GENIE WAS REDUCED TO A HEAP OF ASHES
AND OUT OF IT CAME FORTH A BLACK AND WHITE CAT WITH HER HAIR STANDING ON END AND MEWING IN A FRIGHTFUL MANNER A BLACK WOLF FOLLOWED CLOSE AFTER HER AND GAVE HER NO TIME TO REST THE CAT BEING THUS HARD PRESSED
AND ROSE UP TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS SAYING WHERE AM I
SIR REPLIED THE LADY OF BEAUTY YOUR MAJESTY MAY REMEMBER THAT WHEN I WAS PAST MY INFANCY
I WAS PREPARED TO RETURN THE PRINCESS MY THANKS BUT SHE PREVENTED ME BY ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HER FATHER SIR I HAVE GAINED THE VICTORY OVER THE GENIE AS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE BUT IT IS A VICTORY THAT COSTS ME DEAR I HAVE BUT A FEW MINUTES TO LIVE
AND WOULD PLAY WITH HIM I KISSED THE GROUND AND LAYING MY HAND UPON MY HEAD SIGNIFIED THAT I WAS READY TO RECEIVE THAT HONOUR HE WON THE FIRST GAME BUT I WON THE SECOND AND THIRD AND PERCEIVING HE WAS SOMEWHAT DISPLEASED AT MY SUCCESS
AS SOON AS THE PRINCESS PERCEIVED THIS MONSTER DOG SAID SHE INSTEAD OF CREEPING BEFORE ME DARE YOU PRESENT YOURSELF IN THIS SHAPE THINKING TO FRIGHTEN ME AND THOU REPLIED THE LION
THEIR APPREHENSIONS THEN CHANGED INTO WONDER HOWEVER AS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN AN APE THAT COULD WRITE AND COULD NOT BE PERSUADED THAT I WAS MORE INGENIOUS THAN OTHERS OF MY KIND THEY WISHED TO TAKE THE ROLL OUT OF MY HAND
IT TOUCHED THE ENVIOUS MAN SO MUCH TO THE QUICK THAT HE LEFT HIS HOUSE AND AFFAIRS WITH A RESOLUTION TO RUIN HIM
UPON WHICH HE WENT ON THUS I HAVE CONSTANTLY LIVED IN PERFECT FELICITY BUT BY YOUR ARRIVAL ALL THE HAPPINESS I POSSESSED HAS VANISHED MY DAUGHTER IS DEAD HER GOVERNOR IS NO MORE AND IT IS ONLY THROUGH A MIRACLE THAT I AM MYSELF YET ALIVE
THE DERVISES RECEIVED HIM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT THE SULTAN CALLED THEIR CHIEF ASIDE AND SAID GOOD SHEIK
THE SULTAN WAS HARDLY ABLE TO STAND BUT WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF BEING SUPPORTED TO HIS APARTMENT WHEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS TRAGICAL EVENT HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE PALACE AND THE CITY ALL THE PEOPLE BEWAILED THE MISFORTUNE OF THE PRINCESS THE LADY OF BEAUTY
WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL IMAGINABLE TOKENS OF FRIENDSHIP THE ENVIOUS MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS COME ON PURPOSE TO COMMUNICATE A BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE WHICH HE COULD NOT DO BUT IN PRIVATE
THE SULTAN TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF ANY OF THE WRITINGS EXCEPT MINE WHICH PLEASED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE SAID TO THE OFFICERS
UPON WHICH HE CALLED AN OFFICER GO IMMEDIATELY SAID HE AND CAUSE TO BE PAID TO THIS MAN OUT OF MY TREASURY ONE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD LET HIM HAVE ALSO TWENTY LOADS OF THE RICHEST MERCHANDIZE IN MY STOREHOUSES
THE GENIE HAD FLED THITHER AS TO HIS LAST INTRENCHMENT AND UPON THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE COMBAT DEPENDED WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WITHOUT DANGER TO ME THIS OVERSIGHT OBLIGED ME TO HAVE RECOURSE TO FIRE
IN A CONSIDERABLE TOWN TWO PERSONS DWELT IN ADJOINING HOUSES ONE OF THEM CONCEIVED SUCH A VIOLENT HATRED AGAINST THE OTHER THAT THE HATED PARTY RESOLVED TO REMOVE TO A DISTANCE BEING PERSUADED THAT THEIR BEING NEIGHBOURS WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF THIS ANIMOSITY
ARE THEY NOT WRITTEN BY THE HANDS OF A MAN NO SIR REPLIED THE OFFICERS WE ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT IT WAS AN APE WHO WROTE THEM IN OUR PRESENCE
AND SENT HIM BACK LOADED WITH THE FAVOURS I HAVE ENUMERATED IN SHORT I EMPLOYED ALL MY ELOQUENCE TO PERSUADE HIM TO IMITATE SO GOOD AN EXAMPLE AND TO GRANT ME PARDON BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE HIS COMPASSION
AND THE URN WAS DEPOSITED IN A SUPERB MAUSOLEUM CONSTRUCTED FOR THAT PURPOSE ON THE SPOT WHERE THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN CONSUMED THE GRIEF OF THE SULTAN FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DAUGHTER CONFINED HIM TO HIS CHAMBER FOR A WHOLE MONTH
IN ALL INNOCENCE HOW COULD THEY BE JUST TOWARDS ME HE WHO LIVETH AMONGST THE GOOD PITY TEACHETH HIM TO LIE
AND HATCH EGGS EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH EVERYTHING IS OUT TALKED AND THAT WHICH YESTERDAY WAS STILL TOO HARD FOR TIME ITSELF
AMONGST THE MANY THOU UNIQUE ONE THAN THOU
FORTH FROM THYSELF WHEN WITH WICKED WHISPERING IT SAID SPEAK AND SUCCUMB WHEN IT DISGUSTED THEE WITH ALL THY WAITING AND SILENCE AND DISCOURAGED THY HUMBLE COURAGE
BUT DOWN THERE THERE SPEAKETH EVERYTHING THERE IS EVERYTHING MISHEARD IF ONE ANNOUNCE ONE'S WISDOM WITH BELLS THE SHOPMEN IN THE MARKET PLACE
NOW SAY JUST WHO WAS IT THAT LIKE A WHIRLWIND ONCE RUSHED AWAY FROM ME WHO WHEN DEPARTING CALLED OUT TOO LONG HAVE I SAT WITH LONESOMENESS
O PURE ODOURS AROUND ME HOW FROM A DEEP BREAST
IN SUCH WISE AND ALL THE GODS THEN LAUGHED AND SHOOK UPON THEIR THRONES AND EXCLAIMED IS IT NOT JUST DIVINITY THAT THERE ARE GODS BUT NO GOD
SOME MADE OF SWEET CORN AND SOME WITH TINY YELLOW RICE LIKE BIRD SEED AND HER MAJESTY SAID THAT WE MUST ALL EAT PORRIDGE AFTER OUR MEAT AFTER WE HAD FINALLY FINISHED EATING HER MAJESTY ROSE FROM THE TABLE
NOTHING FALLETH ANY LONGER INTO DEEP WELLS EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH NOTHING SUCCEEDETH ANY LONGER AND ACCOMPLISHETH ITSELF
WHEN THOU STOODEST IN THE FOREST IRRESOLUTE IGNORANT WHERE TO GO BESIDE A CORPSE WHEN THOU SPAKEST LET MINE ANIMALS LEAD ME
FOR EVERYWHERE DO I SMELL SMALL CONCEALED COMMUNITIES AND WHEREVER THERE ARE CLOSETS THERE ARE NEW DEVOTEES THEREIN AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF DEVOTEES
WHO HATH LEARNT FROM THE SAD WINDS THE SADNESS OF SOUNDS NOW PIPETH HE AS THE WIND AND PREACHETH SADNESS IN SAD STRAINS AND SOME OF THEM
NO ONE KNOWETH ANY LONGER HOW TO UNDERSTAND
HIS SECOND COMPANIONS HOWEVER THEY WILL CALL THEMSELVES HIS BELIEVERS WILL BE A LIVING HOST WITH MUCH LOVE MUCH FOLLY MUCH UNBEARDED VENERATION
ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE AND WAS HER MAJESTY'S FAVORITE PLACE AND WHERE SHE SPENT MOST OF HER TIME READING AND RESTING AND WHEN THE SPIRIT MOVED HER SHE WOULD GO FOR A SAIL ON THE LAKE IN THIS PALACE SHE HAD QUITE A NUMBER OF BEDROOMS
WE HAVE AGAIN BECOME PIOUS SO DO THOSE APOSTATES CONFESS AND SOME OF THEM ARE STILL TOO PUSILLANIMOUS THUS TO CONFESS UNTO THEM
DID THEIR EAR PERHAPS HEARKEN YEARNINGLY LONG FOR ME IN VAIN AND FOR MY TRUMPET NOTES AND HERALD CALLS AH EVER ARE THERE BUT FEW OF THOSE
AND NOW DO THEY MALIGN EVEN THEIR MORNING VALOUR VERILY MANY OF THEM ONCE LIFTED THEIR LEGS LIKE THE DANCER TO THEM WINKED THE LAUGHTER OF MY WISDOM
THIS FAINT HEARTED DEVIL PERSUADETH THEE THAT THERE IS A GOD THEREBY HOWEVER DOST THOU BELONG TO THE LIGHT DREADING TYPE TO WHOM LIGHT
THAT WAS TABOOED WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE PALACE AS IT WAS CONSIDERED A GREAT SIN TO KILL AND EAT ANIMALS THAT WERE USED AS BEASTS OF BURDEN THE FOOD CONSISTED MOSTLY OF PORK MUTTON AND GAME FOWLS AND VEGETABLES
ABOUT OLD THINGS DID I HEAR YESTER NIGHT AT THE GARDEN WALL THEY CAME FROM SUCH OLD
IN DARKENED ROOMS FOR SPIRITS TO COME TO HIM AND THE SPIRIT RUNNETH AWAY ENTIRELY OR THEY LISTEN TO AN OLD ROVING HOWL AND GROWL PIPER
TO BLOW AMONGST THEM WITH RUSTLING WINDS BLOW AMONGST THOSE LEAVES O ZARATHUSTRA THAT EVERYTHING WITHERED MAY RUN AWAY FROM THEE THE FASTER
AND WILLINGLY SAYING TO MYSELF THOU FOOL
ONE UNLEARNETH MEN WHEN ONE LIVETH AMONGST THEM THERE IS TOO MUCH FOREGROUND IN ALL MEN WHAT CAN FAR SEEING
AND SHOUTETH SELF CONGRATULATINGLY
THAT DO PEOPLE FABRICATE ON THE CONTRARY THEY
TO RETURN TO THEE WITHOUT TEARS NOW THREATEN ME WITH THE FINGER AS MOTHERS THREATEN NOW SMILE UPON ME AS MOTHERS SMILE
IN INDULGING AND PITYING LAY EVER MY GREATEST DANGER AND ALL HUMAN HUBBUB WISHETH TO BE INDULGED AND TOLERATED WITH SUPPRESSED TRUTHS
OR TIP AND WE HAD TO GIVE EACH OF THE EUNUCHS TEN TAELS FOR THEIR TROUBLE WE AFTERWARDS FOUND OUT THAT WHEN EUNUCHS WENT ANYWHERE TO TAKE PRESENTS FOR HER MAJESTY THEY WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO HER WHEN THEY RETURNED
AND THAT I AM NOT TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT CONCERNS KEEPING HIM CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE IN THIS I WILL DANCE ATTENDANCE ON HIM READILY BUT TO EXPECT ME TO DRAW SWORD EVEN AGAINST RASCALLY CHURLS
OF HIS GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNES WHENEVER HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND THUS THEY BADE EACH OTHER FAREWELL
MIGHT BE READ BY PUTTING TOGETHER THE FIRST LETTERS THE BACHELOR REPLIED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE FAMOUS POETS OF SPAIN WHO WERE THEY SAID ONLY THREE AND A HALF HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO COMPOSE THE REQUIRED VERSES
THAT HIS WIFE NOTICED HIS HAPPINESS A BOWSHOT OFF SO MUCH SO THAT IT MADE HER ASK HIM WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SANCHO FRIEND THAT YOU ARE SO GLAD TO WHICH HE REPLIED WIFE IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD
MARICA AND THOU INTO DONA SO AND SO AND MY LADY THE GIRL WON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS AND AT EVERY TURN SHE WILL FALL INTO A THOUSAND BLUNDERS THAT WILL SHOW THE THREAD OF HER COARSE HOMESPUN STUFF
AND IF GOD WOULD BE PLEASED TO LET ME HAVE MY DAILY BREAD DRY SHOD AND AT HOME WITHOUT TAKING ME OUT INTO THE BYWAYS AND CROSS ROADS AND HE COULD DO IT AT SMALL COST BY MERELY WILLING IT IT IS CLEAR MY HAPPINESS WOULD BE MORE SOLID AND LASTING
THAT ALL THINGS PRESENT THAT OUR EYES BEHOLD BRING THEMSELVES BEFORE US AND REMAIN AND FIX THEMSELVES ON OUR MEMORY MUCH BETTER AND MORE FORCIBLY THAN THINGS PAST
A FINE THING IT WOULD BE INDEED TO MARRY OUR MARIA TO SOME GREAT COUNT OR GRAND GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN THE HUMOUR TOOK HIM WOULD ABUSE HER AND CALL HER CLOWN BRED AND CLODHOPPER'S DAUGHTER AND SPINNING WENCH
LOOK HERE FOOL AND DOLT FOR SO I MAY CALL YOU WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY WORDS AND RUN AWAY FROM GOOD FORTUNE IF I HAD SAID THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS TO THROW HERSELF DOWN FROM A TOWER OR GO ROAMING
AND THE BACHELOR REPLIED THAT IN HIS OPINION HE OUGHT TO GO TO THE KINGDOM OF ARAGON AND THE CITY OF SARAGOSSA WHERE THERE WERE TO BE CERTAIN SOLEMN JOUSTINGS AT THE FESTIVAL OF SAINT GEORGE AT WHICH HE MIGHT WIN RENOWN ABOVE ALL THE KNIGHTS OF ARAGON
AND MY MASTER WILL GIVE HIM AS MUCH GROUTING READY TO HIS HAND IN THE WAY OF ADVENTURES AND ACCIDENTS OF ALL SORTS AS WOULD MAKE UP NOT ONLY ONE SECOND PART BUT A HUNDRED THE GOOD MAN FANCIES NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE
EVEN IF THEY WERE VALUED AT NO MORE THAN FOUR MARAVEDIS APIECE ANOTHER HUNDRED CROWNS WOULD NOT PAY ME FOR HALF OF THEM LET EACH LOOK TO HIMSELF AND NOT TRY TO MAKE OUT
HOWEVER DESIROUS OF DOING WHAT HIS TASK IMPOSED UPON HIM HE WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE IT UNTRANSLATED AND THEREFORE HE WENT ON TO SAY
AND CONTINUE TO LIVE ALL THE SAME AND ARE RECKONED IN THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE THE BEST SAUCE IN THE WORLD IS HUNGER AND AS THE POOR ARE NEVER WITHOUT THAT THEY ALWAYS EAT WITH A RELISH
A RESPECTABLE WOMAN SHOULD HAVE A BROKEN LEG AND KEEP AT HOME AND TO BE BUSY AT SOMETHING IS A VIRTUOUS DAMSEL'S HOLIDAY
IF HE MADE FOUR BALLAD STANZAS OF FOUR LINES EACH THERE WOULD BE A LETTER OVER AND IF HE MADE THEM OF FIVE WHAT THEY CALLED DECIMAS OR
WHITE BLACK AND BLACK WHITE FOR EACH OF US IS AS GOD MADE HIM AYE AND OFTEN WORSE I WILL TAKE CARE SAID CARRASCO TO IMPRESS UPON THE AUTHOR OF THE HISTORY THAT IF HE PRINTS IT AGAIN HE MUST NOT FORGET
I INTEND WIFE TO MAKE SUCH A HIGH MATCH FOR MARI SANCHA THAT THERE WILL BE NO APPROACHING HER WITHOUT CALLING HER MY LADY NAY SANCHO RETURNED TERESA
NOT TO BE SO WELL PLEASED AS I SHOW MYSELF I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU HUSBAND SAID SHE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU WOULD BE GLAD IF IT WERE GOD'S WILL NOT TO BE WELL PLEASED FOR FOOL AS I AM
IF AFTER ALL THIS TIME I HAD COME BACK TO THE HOUSE WITHOUT A RAP AND WITHOUT THE ASS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A POOR LOOK OUT FOR ME AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT ME HERE I AM READY TO ANSWER
AND IT IS NO NEW OCCURRENCE FOR THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO SACRIPANTE AT THE SIEGE OF ALBRACCA THE FAMOUS THIEF BRUNELLO BY THE SAME CONTRIVANCE TOOK HIS HORSE
THE WORLD AS THE INFANTA DONA URRACA WANTED TO DO YOU WOULD BE RIGHT IN NOT GIVING WAY TO MY WILL BUT IF IN AN INSTANT IN LESS THAN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE I PUT THE DON
IT WILL NOT DO TO SHUT IT OUT LET US GO WITH THE FAVOURING BREEZE THAT BLOWS UPON US IT IS THIS SORT OF TALK AND WHAT SANCHO SAYS LOWER DOWN THAT MADE THE TRANSLATOR OF THE HISTORY SAY HE CONSIDERED THIS CHAPTER APOCRYPHAL
AT THE POOR MAN PEOPLE ONLY THROW A HASTY GLANCE ON THE RICH MAN THEY FIX THEIR EYES AND IF THE SAID RICH MAN WAS ONCE ON A TIME POOR IT IS THEN THERE IS THE SNEERING
MY MASTER WILL ATTACK A HUNDRED ARMED MEN AS A GREEDY BOY WOULD HALF A DOZEN MELONS BODY OF THE WORLD SENOR BACHELOR THERE IS A TIME TO ATTACK AND A TIME TO RETREAT
BUT KINGS GO WHERE LAWS LIKE AND I AM CONTENT WITH THIS NAME WITHOUT HAVING THE DON PUT ON TOP OF IT TO MAKE IT SO HEAVY THAT I CANNOT CARRY IT
WHICH WOULD BE WINNING IT ABOVE ALL THE KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD HE COMMENDED HIS VERY PRAISEWORTHY AND GALLANT RESOLUTION BUT ADMONISHED HIM TO PROCEED WITH GREATER CAUTION IN ENCOUNTERING DANGERS BECAUSE HIS LIFE DID NOT BELONG TO HIM
TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTH KNOWING AND TELLING
AND YOU KILLED HER THE MONK EXCLAIMED
OR UNIFORMS WITH BLACK COLLARS AND WITH THE EMBROIDERED BADGES OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE
WITH SUCH AN ILL BRED FELLOW MADE OUT A LIST AGAINST THE GRAIN AND SENT IT IN THIS LIST THERE WERE THREE CONDITIONS WHICH DISPLEASED MAZARIN
POETRY NEEDS KNOWLEDGE AND VISION EXPERIENCE AND IMAGINATION REBECCA
OH YES I KNOW THAT SAID D'ARTAGNAN
WOE TO DE WINTER FOR THE CHILD HAD DONE NO HARM MAY THE DEVIL TAKE ME IF THE CHILD BE NOT DEAD SAID PORTHOS THERE IS SO MUCH FOG IN THAT DETESTABLE COUNTRY AT LEAST SO D'ARTAGNAN DECLARES
AND IT WAS THEREFORE AGREED THAT EACH SHOULD LEAVE A VERY EXACT ADDRESS AND THAT UPON THE REQUEST OF ANY OF THE ASSOCIATES
HE NEVER INTENDED TO KEEP UP BLACKSMITHING FOR GOOD WHEN HE LEASED HIS FARM AND CAME INTO RIVERBORO BUT PROPOSED TO GO BACK TO IT PRESENTLY AND BY THAT TIME EMMA JANE WOULD HAVE FINISHED SCHOOL AND WOULD BE READY TO HELP HER MOTHER WITH THE DAIRY WORK
AND WONDERING IF SHE COULD KEEP THE TEARS BACK UNTIL THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER DON'T GO SO FAST INTERRUPTED MISS MAXWELL THOUGH THEY DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING AS POETRY
OH CRIED THE EXECUTIONER ALL ALL ALL ANSWER THEN IF SHE SEDUCED YOUR BROTHER YOU SAID SHE SEDUCED HIM DID YOU NOT YES IF SHE CAUSED HIS DEATH YOU SAID THAT SHE CAUSED HIS DEATH
WHEN I RECALLED ALL THE EVIL SHE HAD DONE TO ME TO YOU WHAT COULD SHE HAVE DONE TO YOU COME TELL ME SHE HAD SEDUCED AND RUINED MY BROTHER
COULD NEVER DO WITH THE UNSATISFACTORY ORGANS OF VISION GIVEN THEM BY MOTHER NATURE MISS MAXWELL'S GLANCE WAS ALWAYS MEETING A PAIR OF EAGER DARK EYES WHEN SHE SAID ANYTHING PARTICULARLY GOOD SHE LOOKED FOR APPROVAL TO THE CORNER OF THE SECOND BENCH
WHERE THEY WERE SMOKING AND TAKING LIGHT REFRESHMENTS CLOSE TO HIS OWN FRIENDS AND LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
AND FLEW IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW BEARING THE FIRST COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON MISS MAXWELL CAME AND SAT BY REBECCA'S SIDE ON THE BENCH
I WORE A LONG SWORD WHICH CUT LIKE A DAMASCUS YOU REMEMBER IT ARAMIS FOR YOU ALWAYS CALLED IT BALIZARDE WELL I SWEAR TO YOU ALL THREE THAT HAD THE EXECUTIONER OF BETHUNE WAS HE NOT OF BETHUNE YES EGAD OF BETHUNE
TWO CHURCHES AND MANY BOARDING HOUSES BUT ALL ITS INTERESTS GATHERED ABOUT ITS SEMINARY AND ITS ACADEMY THESE SEATS OF LEARNING WERE NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE THAN OTHERS OF THEIR KIND
HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING ME ALL HAVE FORGIVEN ME SOME HAVE EVEN LOVED ME BUT I THINK THAT GOD HAS NOT PARDONED ME FOR THE MEMORY OF THAT EXECUTION PURSUES ME CONSTANTLY AND EVERY NIGHT I SEE THAT WOMAN'S GHOST RISING BEFORE ME
A BLACK ONE BUT OF SATIN SKIN AND BEAUTIFUL LUSTRE HER NAME IS REBECCA AND SHE LOOKS NOT UNLIKE REBEKAH AT THE WELL IN OUR FAMILY BIBLE
SHE WAS PROTECTED BY HER IDEALS THERE WAS LITTLE IN THE LADS SHE HAD MET THUS FAR TO AWAKEN HER FANCY FOR IT HABITUALLY FED ON BETTER MEAT
ONE YEARNS FOR BRAINS FOR APPRECIATION FOR IMAGINATION MONTH AFTER MONTH I TOIL ON OPENING OYSTER AFTER OYSTER BUT SELDOM FINDING A PEARL FANCY MY JOY THIS TERM
SHE WAS YOUNG YOU SAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD BEAUTIFUL RAVISHINGLY BLOND YES ABUNDANCE OF HAIR FALLING OVER HER SHOULDERS YES EYES OF AN ADMIRABLE
OF THE SIGN OF THE HERMITAGE THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS WAS FIXED FOR THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING PRECISELY
AND COMPOSITION MISS MAXWELL AS THE NIECE OF ONE OF MAINE'S EX GOVERNORS AND THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF BOWDOIN'S PROFESSORS WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE PERSONALITY IN WAREHAM AND THAT HER FEW YEARS OF TEACHING HAPPENED TO BE IN REBECCA'S TIME WAS THE HAPPIEST OF ALL CHANCES
MEN WHO BEAR MY ROBE HAVE NO AGE REPLIED THE MONK DRYLY ALAS SPEAK TO ME MORE GENTLY FATHER IN MY LAST MOMENTS I NEED A FRIEND DO YOU SUFFER MUCH ASKED THE MONK YES
THE BEST AND KINDEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE IS RATHER OLD OF COURSE AND SOMETIMES VERY QUIET AND GRAVE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE IS HAPPY HE IS FULL OF FUN AND THEN EVELYN IS NOT AFRAID OF HIM YES THE GIRL SHALL BE CALLED EVELYN ABERCROMBIE
THAT SHE'D ALWAYS FEARED THAT EMMA JANE'S COMPLEXION WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE HEALTHY THAT SOME MEN WOULD BE PROUD OF HAVING AN AMBITIOUS DAUGHTER
YES YES MURMURED HE I HAVE OFTEN FELT REGRET FOR THE VICTIM BUT NEVER THE VERY SLIGHTEST REMORSE FOR THE ASSASSIN
HE ADDED TURNING TO LEVIN AND DRAWING HIS ARM THROUGH HIS LEVIN WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD INDEED TO BE CONVERTED BUT COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT THE POINT WAS
REBECCA'S HEART FLEW LIKE AN ARROW TO ITS MARK AND HER MIND MEETING ITS SUPERIOR SETTLED AT ONCE INTO AN ABIDING
EXERTED ALL HIS INTELLIGENCE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH WAS THE CENTER ROUND WHICH THE OTHERS GROUPED THEMSELVES HE WAS LISTENING AT THAT MOMENT TO SVIAZHSKY AND HLIUSTOV
WAS INVITED BY HIM TO SEND HIM A LIST OF THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH HE WOULD DO HIM THE HONOR TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM
DARED SCARCELY SPEAK OF SOME OF THEIR FORMER GOOD DINNERS HE WAS THE FIRST TO PROPOSE THAT THEY SHOULD ALL ASSEMBLE AROUND SOME WELL SPREAD TABLE AND ABANDON THEMSELVES UNRESERVEDLY TO THEIR OWN NATURAL CHARACTER AND MANNERS
BUT ON THE WHOLE SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ADVANTAGE WAS TAKEN OF IT AMONG THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR STUDENTS THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GOING TO AND FROM THE TRAINS IN COUPLES SOME CARRYING OF HEAVY BOOKS UP THE HILL
A SENSE OF FORM POETS WOULD CALL IT WHEN YOU GROW OLDER
BUT LET ME SEE HOW WAS IT DONE SPEAK SAID THE MONK IT WAS AT NIGHT A MAN CAME TO ME AND SHOWED ME AN ORDER AND I FOLLOWED HIM FOUR OTHER NOBLEMEN AWAITED ME THEY LED ME AWAY MASKED
OH CONNY MURMURED DISAPPOINTEDLY THEN WHAT HAPPENED PRISCILLA ASKED NOTHING AT ALL I GOT OUT AT COOMSDALE AND UNCLE TOM MET ME WITH THE AUTOMOBILE THE CHAUFFEUR TOOK MY SUIT CASE FROM THE PORTER AND I DIDN'T SEE IT NEAR TO AT ALL WE REACHED THE HOUSE JUST AT TEA TIME
AND SHE HOPED HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND WOULD TAKE IT NICELY SHE TELEPHONED TO THE BAGGAGE MAN THAT IT WAS HERE BUT SHE COULDN'T SEND MARTIN WITH IT THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO TO THE FARM FOR SOME EGGS RECREATION WAS OVER AND THE GIRLS CAME TROOPING IN TO GATHER BOOKS AND PADS AND PENCILS FOR THE APPROACHING STUDY HOUR
WHEN WE GOT IN IT WAS CRAM FULL OF MEN THE ENTIRE YALE GLEE CLUB WAS GOING TO THE STATION THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THEY WERE SITTING IN EACH OTHER'S LAPS THE WHOLE TOP LAYER ROSE AND SAID PERFECTLY GRAVELY AND POLITELY MADAME TAKE MY SEAT
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THE POCKET OF THAT NEW DRESS THAT MAKES IT SAG DOWN SO IT'S MY NUTS AND RAISINS FROM DINNER REPLIED REBECCA WHO NEVER SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE MOST INNOCENT ACTION A SECRET FROM HER AUNT MIRANDA THEY'RE JUST WHAT YOU GAVE ME ON MY PLATE WHY DIDN'T YOU EAT THEM
IT WAS PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY PATTY AND HER SUIT CASE ALONE IN THE CAPACIOUS INTERIOR WERE JOLTING ABOUT LIKE TWO TINY PEAS IN A VERY BIG POD
HE NEEDED THE SOAP DREADFULLY AS A PRESENT FOR HIS AUNT MISS JANE STILL LOOKED A LITTLE UNCONVINCED THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID I HOPE YOUR AUNT MIRANDA WON'T MIND BUT YOU KNOW HOW PARTICULAR SHE IS REBECCA AND I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITHOUT ASKING HER FIRST FOR YOUR ACTIONS ARE VERY QUEER
THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING WRONG THIS TIME REBECCA ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY EMMA JANE SOLD HER CAKES TO HER OWN RELATIONS AND TO UNCLE JERRY COBB AND I WENT FIRST TO THOSE NEW TENEMENTS NEAR THE LUMBER MILL AND THEN TO THE LADDS MISTER LADD BOUGHT ALL WE HAD AND MADE US PROMISE TO KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL THE PREMIUM CAME
DON'T YOU THINK CALLING SUPPER ONE'S EVENING MEAL IS PRETTY AND ISN'T BEREFT A NICE WORD YES THAT PART OF IT DOES VERY WELL IT IS THE CAT THE CHIPS AND THE MILK PAIL THAT I DON'T LIKE
THE BANQUET LAMP THERE HAD BEEN COMPANY AT THE BRICK HOUSE TO THE BOUNTIFUL THANKSGIVING DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED AT ONE O'CLOCK THE BURNHAM SISTERS WHO LIVED BETWEEN NORTH RIVERBORO AND SHAKER VILLAGE AND WHO FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
THIS TIME IT WAS A FULL SET OF FURS FOR MISSUS LADD AND TO THINK WE CAN REMEMBER THE TIME HE WAS A BAREFOOT BOY WITHOUT TWO SHIRTS TO HIS BACK IT IS STRANGE HE HASN'T MARRIED WITH ALL HIS MONEY AND HIM SO FOND OF CHILDREN THAT HE ALWAYS HAS A PACK OF THEM AT HIS HEELS
MISTER TUBBS BROUGHT IT OVER FROM NORTH RIVERBORO AND SAID SOMEBODY SENT AN ORDER BY MAIL FOR IT REBECCA SQUEEZED EMMA JANE'S ARM AND EMMA JANE GAVE A RAPTUROUS RETURN SQUEEZE
FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
OUR SELLING THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES CORRECTED REBECCA YOU DID AS MUCH AS I NO I DIDN'T REBECCA RANDALL I JUST SAT AT THE GATE AND HELD THE HORSE YES BUT WHOSE HORSE WAS IT THAT TOOK US TO NORTH RIVERBORO
THREE HUNDRED CAKES EJACULATED MIRANDA WELL THERE'S ONE CROP THAT NEVER FAILS IN RIVERBORO WHAT'S THAT ASKED MISS LYDIA POLITELY THE FOOL CROP RESPONDED MIRANDA TERSELY
ALL THE USHERS AND BRIDESMAIDS WERE THERE AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY JOLLY ONLY I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HALF THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ALL KNEW EACH OTHER AND HAD A LOT OF JOKES I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
HE WAS TRYING TO OBEY LOUISE AND AMUSE LITTLE COUSIN BUT HE WAS THINKING ALL THE TIME
TALKING TO MEN DID YOU TELL THE DOWAGER YES I TOLD HER ABOUT GETTING THE WRONG SUIT CASE I DIDN'T MENTION THE FACT THAT IT BELONGED TO THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE SAID IT WAS VERY CARELESS OF ME TO RUN OFF WITH A STRANGE MAN'S LUGGAGE
PRISCILLA AND CONNY TURNED UPSTAIRS LUGGING THE SUIT CASE BETWEEN THEM WHILE PATTY APPROACHED THE PRINCIPAL'S STUDY TEN MINUTES LATER SHE JOINED HER COMPANIONS IN SEVEN PARADISE ALLEY THEY WERE SITTING ON THE BED THEIR CHINS IN THEIR HANDS
IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLARA BELLE AND I SHOULD NEVER CALL HER REMARKABLE ANSWERED MISS MIRANDA HAS ADAM BEEN HOME AGAIN YES HE'S BEEN STAYING A FEW DAYS WITH HIS AUNT THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE MONEY HE'S MAKING THEY SAY AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS PRESENTS FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS
THE END SAID MAE UNKINDLY WILL BE THAT THE BAGGAGE MAN WILL DELIVER THE SUIT CASE AND JERMYN HILLIARD JUNIOR WILL NEVER KNOW A MAID APPEARED AT THE DOOR IF YOU PLEASE SHE MURMURED HER AMAZED EYES ON IRENE WHO WAS STILL WEARING THE COAT
SHE WAS AS FLUSTERED AS AN OLD HEN WITH ONE CHICKEN SHE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE CONDUCTOR WITH SO MANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT I KNOW HE FELT LIKE A NEWLY ENGAGED NURSEMAID THE GLEE CLUB MEN RODE IN THE SMOKING CAR
MISSUS TRENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MISS PATTY WYATT COME TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND I AM TO TAKE THE SUIT CASE DOWN THE GENTLEMAN IS WAITING OH PATTY A GASP WENT AROUND THE ROOM DO YOUR HAIR UP QUICK PRISCILLA CAUGHT PATTY'S TWIN BRAIDS AND WOUND THEM AROUND HER HEAD
DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
TRULY AND HONEST PATTY TURNED IT OVER AND POINTED TO THE INITIALS ON THE END
BEFORE PATTY RESUMED HER CHRONICLE AND UNCLE TOM MADE ME TELL ABOUT THE SUIT CASE AT THE DINNER TABLE EVERYBODY LAUGHED IT MADE A VERY EXCITING STORY I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE WHOLE SCHOOL GOING TO THE GLEE CLUB AND FALLING IN LOVE IN A BODY WITH THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END
MISS JELLINGS WAS INSISTENT THAT RECREATION SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PURSUED OUT OF DOORS THE TWO COULD EASILY HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GREET PATTY'S RETURN INSIDE BUT IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE TRIO NEVER TO ASK PERMISSION IN MINOR MATTERS IT WASTED ONE'S CREDIT UNNECESSARILY
THEY GAZED WITH WIDE HORRIFIED EYES AND TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO MEET PATTY AS SHE TRUDGED UPSTAIRS LUGGING HER ERRANT SUIT CASE A GLANCE TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND DROPPING ON THE TOP STEP SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING AND LAUGHED
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT SHE JUST WAVED HER HAND TOWARD THE TABLE AND DIDN'T SAY A WORD AND THERE IT WAS WIDE OPEN PATTY TOOK A KEY FROM HER POCKET UNLOCKED THE SUIT CASE AND THREW BACK THE LID A MAN'S DRESS SUIT WAS NEATLY FOLDED ON THE TOP WITH A PIPE A BOX OF CIGARETTES SOME COLLARS
I THINK YOU'RE BEASTLY WELL THE GLEE CLUB WAS LAST THURSDAY NIGHT
THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT IMPULSE MIGHT SEIZE HIM TO MORROW IN THIS CONFOUNDED PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO OCCUPY HIM IMPERIOUSLY THROUGH THE LIVELONG DAY WHAT COULD HE DO TO SECURE HIMSELF FROM ANY MORE OF THIS FOLLY
HOMELESS UNLOVED NOT THE PROMISED BRIDE OF A BRAVE TENDER MAN BUT THERE ARE NO TEARS IN THEM HER TEARS WERE ALL WEPT AWAY IN THE WEARY NIGHT BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP AT THE NEXT STILE THE PATHWAY BRANCHES OFF THERE ARE TWO ROADS BEFORE HER
AND THE SOUND OF THE GURGLING BROOK IF YOU CAME CLOSE TO ONE SPOT BEHIND A SMALL BUSH WOULD BE MINGLED FOR YOUR EAR WITH A DESPAIRING HUMAN SOB NO WONDER MAN'S RELIGION HAS MUCH SORROW IN IT NO WONDER HE NEEDS A SUFFERING GOD
WAS LIKE A SENSE OF LULLING WARMTH THAT MADE HER FOR THE MOMENT INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE AND SHE BEGAN NOW TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE SCHEME BY WHICH SHE SHOULD GET AWAY SHE HAD HAD A LETTER FROM DINAH LATELY FULL OF KIND WORDS ABOUT THE COMING MARRIAGE
ONE LIKES TO PAUSE IN THE MILD RAYS OF THE SUN AND LOOK OVER THE GATES AT THE PATIENT PLOUGH HORSES TURNING AT THE END OF THE FURROW AND THINK THAT THE BEAUTIFUL YEAR IS ALL BEFORE ONE THE BIRDS SEEM TO FEEL JUST THE SAME THEIR NOTES ARE AS CLEAR AS THE CLEAR AIR
DREADING TO MEET MISTER CRAIG TO WHOM SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE SPOKEN CIVILLY HOW RELIEVED SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD GOT SAFELY UNDER THE OAKS AND AMONG THE FERN OF THE CHASE EVEN THEN SHE WAS AS READY TO BE STARTLED AS THE DEER THAT LEAPED AWAY AT HER APPROACH
AT LENGTH HE THOUGHT IT TIME TO TAKE SOME MEASURES FOR PREPARING THE MINDS OF THE MEN GENERALLY FOR WHAT WAS TO COME AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS HE DETERMINED ON PUBLICLY SENDING A MESSENGER TO THE CZAR WITH THE COMPLAINTS WHICH HE HAD TO MAKE IN BEHALF OF HIS MEN THE MEN
HE ALSO ENUMERATED THE VARIOUS GRIEVANCES WHICH THEY SUFFERED UNDER RUSSIAN RULE AND ENDEAVORED TO EXCITE THE ANIMOSITY OF HIS HEARERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AGAINST PETER'S GOVERNMENT
HE CROSSED A CERTAIN RIVER WHICH LAY BETWEEN HIM AND THE SWEDES AND THEN WHEN SAFELY OVER HE STATED TO HIS MEN WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO THE MEN WERE FILLED WITH INDIGNATION AT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH BEING WHOLLY UNEXPECTED CAME UPON THEM BY SURPRISE
BUT A HAPPY TIME NEVERTHELESS FOR IT WAS TAKING HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO MARCH WHEN THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND ALL THE LITTLE PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR NEW HOUSEKEEPING MARKED THE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE LONGED FOR DAY
NO SOMETHING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM THIS DREAD IN YOUNG CHILDISH IGNORANT SOULS THERE IS CONSTANTLY THIS BLIND TRUST IN SOME UNSHAPEN CHANCE
BUT NOW NECESSITY WAS PRESSING HARD UPON HER NOW THE TIME OF HER MARRIAGE WAS CLOSE AT HAND SHE COULD NO LONGER REST IN THIS BLIND TRUST SHE MUST RUN AWAY SHE MUST HIDE HERSELF WHERE NO FAMILIAR EYES COULD DETECT HER
HOWEVER SHE'S REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO ME FOR TEACHING HER SOMETHING TO GET HER BREAD WITH BETTER THAN FARM HOUSE WORK THEY ALWAYS TOLD ME I WAS GOOD NATURED AND THAT'S THE TRUTH AND TO MY HURT TOO ELSE THERE'S THEM IN THIS HOUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW TO LORD IT OVER ME IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM
AS SHE DWELLS ON WRETCHED THOUGHTS AND THROUGH THIS GATE SHE CAN GET INTO A FIELD PATH BEHIND THE WIDE THICK HEDGEROWS
ASK ON WHAT TERMS THE KING WOULD MAKE PEACE WITH HIM BUT CHARLES WAS TOO MUCH ELATED WITH HIS SUCCESS IN CROSSING THE RIVER AND PLACING HIMSELF IN A POSITION FROM WHICH HE COULD ADVANCE WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ANY FARTHER OBSTRUCTION
ALREADY ARTHUR WAS UNCOMFORTABLE HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM HETTY'S WAIST AND SAID HERE WE ARE
WITH A GREAT MANY INDIGNITIES TO ACCOMPANY THE EXECUTION WAS PASSED UPON HIM THE SENTENCE HOWEVER COULD NOT BE EXECUTED UPON MAZEPPA HIMSELF FOR HE WAS OUT OF THE REACH OF HIS ACCUSERS BEING SAFE IN THE SWEDISH CAMP SO THEY MADE A WOODEN IMAGE OR EFFIGY TO REPRESENT HIM
HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIMSELF IRRITATED MORTIFIED HE NO SOONER FIXED HIS MIND ON THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS WHICH HAD STOLEN OVER HIM TO DAY
HE TOOK HER HAND AND LOOKED AT HER HALF SADLY HALF WITH A CONSTRAINED SMILE HETTY'S EYES SEEMED TO BESEECH HIM NOT TO GO AWAY YET BUT HE PATTED HER CHEEK AND SAID GOOD BYE AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND GO ON AS FOR ARTHUR
MARCHED AT ONCE TO THE NEAREST BODY OF RUSSIAN FORCES AND PUT THEMSELVES UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE RUSSIAN GENERAL THERE A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS SOON AFTER CALLED IN THE RUSSIAN CAMP FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING MAZEPPA TO TRIAL HE WAS OF COURSE FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCE OF DEATH
HE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER THAT WOULD SHELTER HER FROM DISCOVERY AND SCORN AMONG THE RELATIVES AND NEIGHBOURS WHO ONCE MORE MADE ALL HER WORLD NOW HER AIRY DREAM HAD VANISHED HER IMAGINATION NO LONGER SAW HAPPINESS WITH ARTHUR FOR HE COULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY OR SOOTHE HER PRIDE
I HAVE COME ON SOMETHING BY THE ROADSIDE WHICH HAS REMINDED ME THAT I AM NOT IN LOAMSHIRE AN IMAGE OF A GREAT AGONY THE AGONY OF THE CROSS IT HAS STOOD PERHAPS BY THE CLUSTERING APPLE BLOSSOMS OR IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE BY THE CORNFIELD
THEY REFUSED TO JOIN IN THE REVOLT A SCENE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT AND CONFUSION FOLLOWED A PORTION OF THE COSSACKS THOSE WITH WHOM MAZEPPA HAD COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING BEFOREHAND WERE DISPOSED TO GO WITH HIM BUT THE REST WERE FILLED WITH VEXATION AND RAGE
BUT WHILE THE CZAR WAS THUS RAPIDLY INCREASING HIS POWER AT SEA THE KING OF SWEDEN PROVED HIMSELF THE STRONGEST ON LAND HE EXTENDED HIS CONQUESTS VERY RAPIDLY IN POLAND AND IN THE ADJOINING PROVINCES AND AT LAST IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN O EIGHT
AND WHILE HE WAS THERE SOMETHING HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HIM AND MADE HIM GALLOP BACK IT SEEMED HE COULDN'T QUITE DEPEND ON HIS OWN RESOLUTION AS HE HAD THOUGHT HE COULD HE ALMOST WISHED HIS ARM WOULD GET PAINFUL AGAIN AND THEN HE SHOULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE COMFORT IT WOULD BE TO GET RID OF THE PAIN
IT MIGHT BE THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE WITH WORK AND ANXIETY NOW FOR SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS MISSUS POYSER HAD TAKEN ANOTHER COLD WHICH HAD BROUGHT ON INFLAMMATION AND THIS ILLNESS HAD CONFINED HER TO HER ROOM ALL THROUGH JANUARY HETTY HAD TO MANAGE EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS
BUT NOT THAT SHE MAY HAVE A MORE LINGERING ENJOYMENT OF THE SUNSHINE AND THINK WITH HOPE OF THE LONG UNFOLDING YEAR SHE HARDLY KNOWS THAT THE SUN IS SHINING AND FOR WEEKS NOW WHEN SHE HAS HOPED AT ALL IT HAS BEEN FOR SOMETHING AT WHICH SHE HERSELF TREMBLES AND SHUDDERS
AND THIS HAD CAUSED HIM TO CAST A WISTFUL EYE ON THAT OTHER CHURCH WHOSE FOLLOWERS WERE ALAS ACCORDED A LITTLE MORE LIBERTY THAN WAS PERHAPS GOOD FOR THEIR SOULS BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW AND IN ANY CASE HE WOULD LIKE TO CORRESPOND ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS WITH ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE
IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT MY BROTHER WAS TO HAVE AN EARLY HOUR EACH MORNING WITH THE MASTER BEFORE SCHOOL HOURS AND AN HOUR OR TWO IN THE EVENING VERY SOON IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT THE STUDIES WERE NOT PROGRESSING SMOOTHLY
HE WOULD FORGET ALL ABOUT SCHOOL HOURS ROAM ABOUT THE GARDENS AND PLANTATIONS GET INTO LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WORKMEN AND EVENTUALLY WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS SOMEWHAT TOO CASUAL TO PLEASE HIS EMPLOYER HE ENJOINED US TO LOOK HIM UP AND LET HIM KNOW WHEN IT WAS SCHOOL TIME
HE HAD BEEN HUMILIATED AND PAINED AT THE DISINTERESTED HOSPITALITY AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY SHOWN TO HIM BY THOSE OUTSIDE THE PALE AFTER THE TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS FELLOW PRIESTS
HE WAS A GREAT FIGHTER AT ALL EVENTS HE CAME TO OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THAT REPUTATION AND I AT THAT TIME AT THE AGE OF NINE LIKE MY ELDER BROTHERS HAD COME TO TAKE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE FIGHTING GAUCHO
ALSO THAT THE DOGS IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR NOISE AND FURY NEVER REALLY TRIED TO PULL ME OFF MY HORSE AND TEAR ME TO PIECES
HE PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD DO THE SAME HE OF COURSE WOULD EDIT THE PAPER AND WRITE A LARGE PORTION OF IT IT WOULD OCCUPY TWO OR FOUR SHEETS OF QUARTO PAPER ALL IN HIS BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WHICH RESEMBLED COPPER PLATE AND IT WOULD BE ISSUED FOR ALL OF US TO READ EVERY SATURDAY
BUT AS I HAVE RELATED HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO INFLICT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT ON US AND WAS FINALLY GOT RID OF BECAUSE IN ONE OF HIS DEMONIACAL MOODS HE THRASHED US BRUTALLY WITH HIS HORSEWHIP
HE WOULD EXHIBIT HIM AS THE MEANEST MOST CONTEMPTIBLE INSECT THAT EVER CRAWLED ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FURIOUS TIRADE MY POOR LITTLE BROTHER BURST OUT CRYING
IN THIS WAY THINKING OF AND LOOKING ONLY FOR THE BIRDS I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY AND AS I GREW TO KNOW THEM BETTER FROM YEAR TO YEAR I SOMETIMES BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM TOO AND IN THIS
MOUNTING WE WOULD SET OFF O'KEEFE AHEAD ABSORBED AS USUAL IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHILE WE AT A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO WOULD FORM IN LINE AND GO THROUGH OUR EVOLUTIONS CHASING THE FLYING ENEMY O'KEEFE
I HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS OF THIS KIND BUT THESE WERE FIGHTS OF ORDINARY OR SMALL MEN AND WERE VERY SMALL AFFAIRS COMPARED WITH THE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FAMOUS FIGHTERS ABOUT WHICH WE HAD NEWS FROM TIME TO TIME
YES HE COULD PLAY TO ANY MAN'S SINGING ANY TUNE HE LIKED TO CALL HE WAS A BIG LOUD VOICED TALKATIVE MAN NOT KNOWN TO ANY PERSON PRESENT
BARBOZA ROSE SCOWLING FROM HIS SEAT AND DROPPING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS FACON SAID WHO IS THIS WHO FORBIDS ME BASILIO BARBOZA TO SING OF EIGHTEEN FORTY I FORBID YOU SHOUTED THE STRANGER IN A RAGE AND SMITING HIS BREAST
HAD HE NEVER HEARD OF BARBOZA THE CELEBRATED FIGHTER WHO HAD KILLED SO MANY MEN IN FIGHTS PERHAPS HE HAD HEARD AND DID NOT WISH TO DIE JUST YET
HE WAS IN HIDING SOMEWHERE KEEPING WATCH ON THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS ENEMY WHO WAS NO DOUBT ENGAGED ALREADY IN WRITING THAT DREADFUL ARTICLE WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM A MARKED BEING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
OR IN THE SCHOOLROOM WITHOUT HER FOR SHE WAS CONSTANTLY BEING CALLED AWAY AND WHEN PRESENT A PORTION OF THE TIME WAS SPENT IN A LITTLE TALK WHICH WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH OUR LESSONS FOR WE MOVED AND BREATHED AND HAD OUR BEING IN A STRANGE MORAL ATMOSPHERE
HALF A DOZEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ONE OR TWO MARRIED AND ONE THE HEAD AND LEADER OF THE TRIBE OR FAMILY A BIG MAN AGED ABOUT FORTY WITH FIERCE EAGLE LIKE EYES UNDER BUSHY BLACK EYEBROWS THAT LOOKED LIKE TUFTS OF FEATHERS
WHERE LAWLESS ACTS WERE COMMON AND EVIL AND GOOD WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AND ALL THIS MADE HER MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR SPIRITUAL THAN OUR MENTAL NEEDS
HOWEVER NEWS OF HIS MOVEMENTS AND A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION ABOUT HIM REACHED US INCIDENTALLY FROM ALL WHICH IT APPEARED THAT DURING HIS TIME WITH US AND FOR SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY FATHER O'KEEFE HAD BEEN WORKING OUT HIS OWN SALVATION IN A QUIET WAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH A RATHER ELABORATE PLAN WHICH HE HAD DEVISED
HE HAD HEARD OR READ OF A FAMILY OF BOYS LIVING JUST LIKE US IN SOME WILD ISOLATED LAND WHERE THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS OR TEACHERS AND NO NEWSPAPERS WHO AMUSED THEMSELVES BY WRITING A JOURNAL OF THEIR OWN WHICH WAS ISSUED ONCE A WEEK
THE PRIEST WOULD COME FORTH AS USUAL WITH A SMILING PLACID COUNTENANCE MY BROTHER WITH A BLACK SCOWL ON HIS FACE
AT DINNER TIME HE WOULD BROACH THE SUBJECT AND SAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN VERY HARD AT THEIR STUDIES ALL THE MORNING AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO FORCE THEIR YOUNG MINDS TOO MUCH THAT ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY
THEN OUR EDITOR CALLED US TOGETHER TO HEAR AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION HE WISHED TO MAKE FIRST HE SHOWED US BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO READ OR HANDLE A FAIR COPY OF THE PAPER OR OF THE PORTION HE HAD DONE JUST TO ENABLE US TO APPRECIATE THE CARE HE WAS TAKING OVER IT
AND THREE OR FOUR SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS I WILL DESCRIBE THOSE I KNEW BEST OR THAT INTERESTED ME THE MOST NOT ONLY AS I FIRST KNEW OR BEGAN TO KNOW THEM IN MY SEVENTH YEAR BUT IN SEVERAL INSTANCES I SHALL BE ABLE TO TRACE THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES FOR SOME YEARS FURTHER ON
I HAD NO INCLINATION TO DO ANYTHING WITH BOOKS MYSELF BOOKS WERE LESSONS THEREFORE REPELLENT AND THAT ANY ONE SHOULD READ A BOOK FOR PLEASURE WAS INCONCEIVABLE
EVERY ONE INSTANTLY UNDERSTOOD THE CASE OF THIS POOR MAN HALF CRAZED AT THE SUDDEN RECOLLECTION OF HIS WASTED AND RUINED LIFE AND IT DID NOT SEEM RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD BLEED AND PERHAPS DIE FOR SUCH A CAUSE
THEN BEGINNING TO SEE IT IN A HUMOROUS LIGHT HE WOULD SHOUT WITH LAUGHTER AT THE PRIEST'S PRETENTIONS TO KNOW ANYTHING AND WOULD SAY HE WAS ONLY FIT TO TEACH BABIES JUST OUT OF THE CRADLE TO SAY THEIR A B C
SAINT ANTHONY WAS THE SAINT SHE WAS DEVOTED TO AND SHE HAD TAKEN HIS IMAGE FROM ITS PLACE IN HER BEDROOM AND TIED A STRING ROUND ITS LEGS AND LET IT DOWN THE WELL AND LEFT IT THERE WITH ITS HEAD IN THE WATER HE WAS HER OWN SAINT SHE SAID AND AFTER ALL HER DEVOTION TO HIM AND ALL THE CANDLES AND FLOWERS THIS WAS HOW HE TREATED HER
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THAT HE CONSIDERED IT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO MORE LESSONS IN THE AFTERNOON TO GO FOR A RIDE HE ALWAYS GAINED HIS POINT AND DINNER OVER WE WOULD RUSH OUT TO CATCH AND SADDLE OUR HORSES AND ONE FOR FATHER O'KEEFE
I BELIEVE FROM LATER EXPERIENCE THAT EVEN IF IT HAD LASTED BUT A FEW WEEKS IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE HABIT OF RECORDING MY OBSERVATIONS AND THAT IS A HABIT WITHOUT WHICH THE KEENEST OBSERVATION AND THE MOST FAITHFUL MEMORY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE FIELD NATURALIST THUS
FAINT SHE'S BEEN SO BEFORE OFTEN SHE IS DEAD REPLIED MARGARET
SO FAR SO GOOD BUT WHERE WAS MISTER HALE
COME UP NOW MY HEART'S WELLY BROSSEN
BUT UNWILLING TO USE THE VIOLENCE HE HAD THREATENED NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MARGARET LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM COME WITH ME SHE SAID COME AND SEE HER
I ALWAYS DISLIKE THAT DOING THINGS IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MISSUS HALE MARGARET WAS SILENT COME NOW MA'AM SAID DIXON WITH A KIND OF CHEERFUL AUTHORITY YOU KNOW SEEING MASTER FREDERICK IS JUST THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS YOU'RE LONGING FOR
AY SOOTH WE FEEL TOO STRONG IN WEAL TO NEED THEE ON THAT ROAD BUT WOE BEING COME THE SOUL IS DUMB THAT CRIETH NOT ON GOD MISSUS BROWNING
MISTER HIGGINS I'M SURE YOU'LL JOIN US IN FAMILY PRAYER HIGGINS LOOKED AT MARGARET DOUBTFULLY HER GRAVE SWEET EYES MET HIS THERE WAS NO COMPULSION ONLY DEEP INTEREST IN THEM HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT HE KEPT HIS PLACE
ANY NIGHT BUT TO NIGHT OH HELP ME HE'S GOING OUT TO DRINK AGAIN FATHER I'LL NOT LEAVE YO
HE SHOOK HIMSELF HEAVILY GAVE THEM ONE MORE SULLEN LOOK SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT MADE FOR THE DOOR OH FATHER FATHER SAID MARY THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS ARM
AT LAST HIGGINS FOUND WORDS MAN I COULD FELL YO TO THE GROUND FOR TEMPTING ME
NOT YET PAPA I THINK PERHAPS NOT AT ALL LET US ASK HIM ABOUT THE STRIKE AND GIVE HIM ALL THE SYMPATHY HE NEEDS
MARY WAS HUMBLY SOBBING IN THE BACK GROUND THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD
MARGARET POURED OUT THE TEA IN SILENCE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO SAY
WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON STRANGERS FAR AWAY AS THE INJURIES FANCIED OR REAL HAD UPON THEMSELVES
IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE BUT MARGARET ASSURED HIM
THE NOISE APPEARED TO ROUSE HIM HE TOOK SUDDEN HOLD OF MARGARET'S ARM AND HELD HER TILL HE COULD GATHER WORDS TO SPEAK
SAID MARGARET VERY SOFTLY HE UNDERSTOOD HER AND TOOK HER OFFERED HAND HOME MISS
WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
YOU FORGET SAID MARGARET I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF BOUCHER BUT THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM IT WAS NOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS HE SPOKE OF BUT THOSE OF HIS
WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
NOR TO THE LEFT WHILE HE TRAMPED ALONG BY MARGARET'S SIDE HE FEARED BEING UPSET BY THE WORDS STILL MORE THE LOOKS OF SYMPATHISING NEIGHBOURS SO HE AND MARGARET WALKED IN SILENCE AS HE GOT NEAR THE STREET IN WHICH HE KNEW SHE LIVED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS CLOTHES HIS HANDS AND SHOES
THEREFORE TO RECTIFY YOUR OPINIONS IN IS THE SCIENCE OF TRADE I'M GLAD SIR SAID HIGGINS WITH A CURIOUS WINK OF HIS EYE THAT YO PUT IN SO THEY THINK
WHILE HE IS HERE THEY'LL BE CLEVER IF THEY COME IN PAST ME SAID DIXON SHOWING HER TEETH AT THE BARE IDEA
IF IT WERE BUT FOR AN END WHICH AFFECTED THE GOOD OF ALL INSTEAD OF THAT OF MERELY ONE CLASS AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER I RECKON IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE GOING SIR SAID HIGGINS AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN HOME
HE STARED BACK ON HER WITH GLOOMY FIERCENESS IF SHE HAD STIRRED
HE STOOD UNCERTAIN WITH DOGGED IRRESOLUTION UPON HIS FACE
BUT AT LAST HE MOVED TOWARDS THE STAIRS SHE AND HE STOOD BY THE CORPSE
BUT HER CALM FACE FIXED ON HIS PATIENT AND TRUSTFUL COMPELLED HIM TO ANSWER
MISSUS HALE LIFTED HERSELF UP FROM A DOZE WHEN DID YOU WRITE TO FREDERICK MARGARET YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY MAMMA YESTERDAY AND THE LETTER WENT
AND THAT WAS DEATH IT LOOKED MORE PEACEFUL THAN LIFE ALL BEAUTIFUL SCRIPTURES CAME INTO HER MIND THEY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS THE WEARY ARE AT REST HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP SLOWLY SLOWLY MARGARET TURNED AWAY FROM THE BED
THOUGH HE HURT HER ARM WITH HIS GRIPE AND WILD GLEAMS CAME ACROSS THE STUPIDITY OF HIS EYES SHE IS DEAD SHE SAID HE LOOKED AT HER STILL WITH THAT SEARCHING LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO FADE OUT OF HIS EYES AS HE GAZED
I'VE BEEN THINKING SHE MIGHT GO AND SEE HER MOTHER JUST AT THAT VERY TIME
ON WHICH TO ARGUE FOR THE RIGHT AND THE JUST AND WHAT ARE THE UNION'S WAYS AND MEANS
MISTER HIGGINS I TRUST WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE GIVEN UP YOU BELIEVE' MISTER HALE'S VOICE DROPPED LOW IN REVERENCE
AND THOUGH THY SPIRIT'S LIFE TRIALS UNTOLD ASSAIL WITH GIANT STRENGTH GOOD CHEER GOOD CHEER SOON ENDS THE BITTER STRIFE AND THOU SHALT REIGN IN PEACE WITH CHRIST AT LENGTH
YE THINK I FORGET WHO'S LYING THERE AND HOW HOO LOVED YO AND
SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A WILD SEARCHING INQUIRY IN HIS GLANCE
THERE WILL BE SOME RISK NO DOUBT BUT WE WILL LESSEN IT AS MUCH AS EVER WE CAN AND IT IS SO LITTLE
THEN MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD COME THE FACE OFTEN SO WEARY WITH PAIN SO RESTLESS WITH TROUBLOUS THOUGHTS HAD NOW THE FAINT SOFT SMILE OF ETERNAL REST UPON IT
WHICH FIRST SUGGESTED TO MARGARET THE IDEA THAT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING NOT ENOUGH TO INTOXICATE HIMSELF BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS THOUGHTS BEWILDERED BUT SHE WERE YOUNGER THAN ME
I SOME PLACES THEM'S FINED WHO SPEAKS TO HIM YO TRY THAT MISS TRY LIVING A YEAR OR TWO AMONG THEM AS LOOKS AWAY IF YO LOOK AT EM TRY WORKING WITHIN TWO YARDS O CROWDS O MEN WHO
I DON'T EXPECT TO CONVINCE YOU IN A DAY NOT IN ONE CONVERSATION BUT LET US KNOW EACH OTHER AND SPEAK FREELY TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL
MARGARET FELT THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED HER POWER WHAT COULD SHE DO NEXT HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR
ALONG WI IT COME CRIMES BUT I THINK IT WERE A GREATER CRIME TO LET IT ALONE OUR ONLY CHANCE IS BINDING MEN TOGETHER IN ONE COMMON INTEREST AND IF SOME ARE COWARDS AND SOME ARE FOOLS THEY MUN COME ALONG AND JOIN THE GREAT MARCH WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH IS IN NUMBERS OH
THAT WERE ALL BUT THAT WERE ENOUGH FOR ME MISTER HALE BLEW HIS NOSE AND GOT UP TO SNUFF THE CANDLES IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS EMOTION
AS SHE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN MORE HE HAD SHAKEN OFF HIS EMOTION AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER GIVEN WAY TO IT
POOR FELLOW ECHOED MISSUS HALE BUT I ALMOST WISH YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN WOULD IT BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM IF YOU WROTE AGAIN MARGARET I'M AFRAID IT WOULD MAMMA SAID MARGARET REMEMBERING THE URGENCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTREATED HIM TO COME DIRECTLY IF HE WISHED TO SEE HIS MOTHER ALIVE
THEY CAME UP THICK AND CHOKED AND HOARSE WERE YO WITH HER
AND A MAN S NO MAN WHO'LL GROAN OUT LOUD
WHY SAID MARGARET
DYING SO LONG THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIMSELF SHE WOULD NOT DIE THAT SHE WOULD PULL THROUGH MARGARET FELT AS IF SHE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTING HERSELF WITH THE SURROUNDINGS OF DEATH WHICH HE THE FATHER HAD ONLY JUST LEARNT
IS THAT THE REASON YOU'RE SO SOON AT HOME TO NIGHT ASKED MARGARET INNOCENTLY THOU KNOW'ST NOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL SAID HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY I'M NOT ONE WI TWO FACES
I MUST GO TO MILTON BY THE NEXT TRAIN THE BAG WAS PACKED THE CAB ORDERED THE RAILWAY REACHED IN TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE MOMENT OF THIS DECISION THE LONDON TRAIN WHIZZED BY DREW BACK SOME YARDS AND IN MISTER BELL WAS HURRIED BY THE IMPATIENT GUARD
HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY SO LONG A PERIOD OF ANXIETY AND CARE EVEN INTERMIXED WITH STORMS THAT HER MIND HAD LOST ITS ELASTICITY SHE TRIED TO FIND HERSELF OCCUPATION IN TEACHING THE TWO YOUNGER BOUCHER CHILDREN
THE ACTION OF THE HEART MUST HAVE CEASED AS HE LAY DOWN MISTER BELL WAS STUNNED BY THE SHOCK AND ONLY RECOVERED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR BEING ANGRY AT EVERY SUGGESTION OF HIS MAN'S A CORONER'S INQUEST POOH YOU DON'T THINK I POISONED HIM
WHAT BROTHER A BROTHER OF HER AUNT'S NO NO A CLEVER LENNOX THE CAPTAIN'S A FOOL YOU MUST UNDERSTAND A YOUNG BARRISTER WHO WILL BE SETTING HIS CAP AT MARGARET
BUT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE FELT SHOCKED OR GRIEVED OR INDIGNANT AT HIS FALLING OFF IN THE ABSTRACT AS SOON AS THEY SAW THE FACE OF THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD ONCE LOVED THEY FORGOT HIS OPINIONS IN HIMSELF
IN SOME TIME HIS GOOD TIME I SHALL ARRIVE HE GUIDES ME AND THE BIRD IN HIS GOOD TIME BROWNING'S PARACELSUS SO THE WINTER WAS GETTING ON
I WOULD TAKE A LIVE DRAGON INTO MY HOUSE TO LIVE IF BY HIRING SUCH A CHAPERON AND SETTING UP AN ESTABLISHMENT OF MY OWN I COULD MAKE MY OLD AGE HAPPY WITH HAVING MARGARET FOR A DAUGHTER BUT THERE ARE THOSE LENNOXES WHO ARE THEY ASKED MISTER THORNTON WITH TREMBLING INTEREST
AND THE LETTERS ANNOUNCING THE MARRIAGE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A SPLENDID BLACK LACE MANTILLA CHOSEN BY DOLORES HERSELF FOR HER UNSEEN SISTER IN LAW WHOM FREDERICK HAD REPRESENTED AS A PARAGON OF BEAUTY WISDOM AND VIRTUE
WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER I OFTEN THINK I SUPPOSE THE LENNOXES WILL ASK HER TO LIVE WITH THEM I TRY TO THINK THEY WILL HER AUNT SHAW LOVED HER WELL IN HER OWN QUIET WAY BUT SHE FORGETS TO LOVE THE ABSENT
MARTHA'S WHOLE FACE BRIGHTENED AND ON A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT OUT CAME A LONG STORY OF HOW HER FATHER HAD BEEN IN EARLY LIFE CONNECTED WITH MISSUS THORNTON'S HUSBAND NAY HAD EVEN BEEN IN A POSITION TO SHOW HIM SOME KINDNESS
AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAD INTERVENED TO SEPARATE THE TWO FAMILIES UNTIL MARTHA WAS NEARLY GROWN UP WHEN HER FATHER HAVING SUNK LOWER AND LOWER FROM HIS ORIGINAL OCCUPATION AS CLERK IN A WAREHOUSE AND HER MOTHER BEING DEAD SHE AND HER SISTER
WHAT MARTHA HARDLY KNEW
OF TRYING TO IMAGINE HOW EVERY EVENT THAT SHE HEARD OF IN RELATION TO MISTER THORNTON WOULD AFFECT HIM WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE IT OR DISLIKE IT THE NEXT DAY SHE HAD THE LITTLE BOUCHER CHILDREN FOR THEIR LESSONS AND TOOK A LONG WALK
SHE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRAWING ROOM AS IF ARRESTED IN HER FIRST IMPULSE TO RUSH DOWNSTAIRS AND AS IF BY THE SAME RESTRAINING THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE SO WHITE AND IMMOVEABLE WAS SHE
NOW HALE YOU KNOW THAT GIRL OF YOURS HAS GOT PRETTY NEARLY ALL MY HEART I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE OF COURSE AS YOUR DAUGHTER AS MY GOD DAUGHTER I TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN HER BEFORE I SAW HER THE LAST TIME
IN THE SAME CALM FRIENDLY WAY NEVER AVOIDING AND NEVER SEEKING ANY MENTION OF HER NAME SHE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS TO RAISE HER FATHER'S TONE OF MIND THE DREARY PEACEFULNESS OF THE PRESENT TIME
BUT WHAT GULLS MEN ARE THERE WAS A PAUSE MISTER HALE SPOKE FIRST IN CONTINUATION OF HIS THOUGHT ABOUT MARGARET WELL ABOUT MARGARET WHAT THEN IF I DIE NONSENSE
AND SEEK THE TRUE METHOD OF SUBDUING THEM INTO THE ELEMENTS OF PEACE ALL THESE WEEKS SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THEIR EXISTENCE IN A DULL KIND OF WAY THOUGH THEY WERE HIDDEN OUT OF SIGHT NOW ONCE FOR ALL SHE WOULD CONSIDER THEM
OH SMART LONDON PEOPLE WHO VERY LIKELY WILL THINK THEY'VE THE BEST RIGHT TO HER CAPTAIN LENNOX MARRIED HER COUSIN THE GIRL SHE WAS BROUGHT UP WITH GOOD ENOUGH PEOPLE I DARE SAY AND THERE'S HER AUNT MISSUS SHAW
AND THE DAYS WERE BEGINNING TO LENGTHEN WITHOUT BRINGING WITH THEM ANY OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF HOPE WHICH USUALLY ACCOMPANIES THE RAYS OF A FEBRUARY SUN MISSUS THORNTON HAD OF COURSE ENTIRELY CEASED TO COME TO THE HOUSE MISTER THORNTON CAME OCCASIONALLY
AND WHICH HE REPEATED WITH ALL THE DEVELOPED CADENCE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT WHEN MARGARET HAD DULY APPLAUDED NICHOLAS CALLED FOR ANOTHER AND YET ANOTHER MUCH TO HER SURPRISE
WHEN HER FATHER HAD DRIVEN OFF ON HIS WAY TO THE RAILROAD MARGARET FELT HOW GREAT AND LONG HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE ON HER TIME AND HER SPIRITS IT WAS ASTONISHING ALMOST STUNNING TO FEEL HERSELF SO MUCH AT LIBERTY
WHICH CRUSTED OVER HER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER WITH AN OBEDIENCE THAT WAS ALMOST MECHANICAL SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO INDUCE MARTHA TO SPEAK OF ANY OF HER PERSONAL INTERESTS BUT AT LAST SHE TOUCHED THE RIGHT CHORD IN NAMING MISSUS THORNTON
THEN HE SAID HE GAVE YOU STRENGTH TO DO WHAT YOUR CONSCIENCE TOLD YOU WAS RIGHT AND I DON'T SEE THAT WE NEED ANY HIGHER OR HOLIER STRENGTH THAN THAT OR WISDOM EITHER I KNOW I HAVE NOT THAT MUCH
NOT A WISH OF HIS THAT SHE DID NOT STRIVE TO FORECAST AND TO FULFIL THEY WERE QUIET WISHES TO BE SURE AND HARDLY NAMED WITHOUT HESITATION AND APOLOGY ALL THE MORE COMPLETE AND BEAUTIFUL WAS HER MEEK SPIRIT OF OBEDIENCE
AND THE ANGEL WITH THE GRAVE AND COMPOSED FACE STANDING VERY NIGH BECKONING TO HIS FRIEND THAT NIGHT MISTER HALE LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE PILLOW ON WHICH IT NEVER MORE SHOULD STIR WITH LIFE
IN THE NEXT LETTER FREDERICK SPOKE SO JOYFULLY OF THE FUTURE THAT HE HAD NO THOUGHT FOR THE PAST AND MARGARET FOUND A USE IN HERSELF FOR THE PATIENCE SHE HAD BEEN CRAVING FOR HIM SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE PATIENT
THAT CUSTOM SIR SQUIRE REPLIED SANCHO MAY HOLD GOOD AMONG THOSE BULLIES AND FIGHTING MEN YOU TALK OF
IT HUNG DOWN TWO FINGERS LENGTH BELOW HIS MOUTH
AS TO WHAT YOU SAY SIR KNIGHT ABOUT HAVING VANQUISHED MOST OF THE KNIGHTS OF SPAIN
I CAME I SAW I CONQUERED AND I MADE HER STAY QUIET AND BEHAVE HERSELF FOR NOTHING BUT NORTH WINDS BLEW FOR MORE THAN A WEEK ANOTHER TIME I WAS ORDERED TO LIFT THOSE ANCIENT STONES THE MIGHTY BULLS OF GUISANDO
BUT AS IT IS NOT BECOMING FOR KNIGHTS TO PERFORM THEIR FEATS OF ARMS IN THE DARK LIKE HIGHWAYMEN AND BULLIES LET US WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT THAT THE SUN MAY BEHOLD OUR DEEDS
IN WASTING TIME WHILE I STOPPED TO RAISE MY VISOR BEFORE COMPELLING YOU TO CONFESS WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE I MAINTAIN WELL THEN SAID DON QUIXOTE WHILE WE ARE MOUNTING YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL ME IF I AM THAT DON QUIXOTE WHOM YOU SAID YOU VANQUISHED
SO AS TO DEFRAUD HIM OF THE FAME THAT HIS EXALTED ACHIEVEMENTS AS A KNIGHT HAVE EARNED AND ACQUIRED FOR HIM THROUGHOUT THE KNOWN WORLD AND IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS I MUST TELL YOU TOO
WHICH I LOOK UPON AS BROKEN AND SPLIT ALREADY THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FIGHT THAT I HAVE NO SWORD FOR I NEVER CARRIED ONE IN MY LIFE
ON ONE OCCASION SHE BADE ME GO AND CHALLENGE THE FAMOUS GIANTESS OF SEVILLE LA GIRALDA BY NAME WHO IS AS MIGHTY AND STRONG AS IF MADE OF BRASS AND THOUGH NEVER STIRRING FROM ONE SPOT IS THE MOST RESTLESS AND CHANGEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD
CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE AMONG THE THINGS THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND THE KNIGHT OF THE WOOD THE HISTORY TELLS US HE OF THE GROVE SAID TO DON QUIXOTE IN FINE SIR KNIGHT
INTO A FOUL AND MEAN VILLAGE LASS AND IN THE SAME WAY THEY MUST HAVE TRANSFORMED DON QUIXOTE
HERE IS MY SWORD THAT WILL COMPEL INCREDULITY ITSELF TO GIVE CREDENCE TO IT CALM YOURSELF SIR KNIGHT SAID DON QUIXOTE AND GIVE EAR TO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY TO YOU I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THIS DON QUIXOTE YOU SPEAK OF IS THE GREATEST FRIEND I HAVE IN THE WORLD
BUT WHAT I MOST PLUME AND PRIDE MYSELF UPON IS HAVING VANQUISHED IN SINGLE COMBAT THAT SO FAMOUS KNIGHT
THOUGH YOU SEEM TO BE THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO ARE NOT SO
AND BEHOLD WHAT THOU ART TO SEE BUT NOT TO BELIEVE
AN ENTERPRISE THAT MIGHT MORE FITLY BE ENTRUSTED TO PORTERS THAN TO KNIGHTS AGAIN SHE BADE ME FLING MYSELF INTO THE CAVERN OF CABRA AN UNPARALLELED AND AWFUL PERIL AND BRING HER A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT IS CONCEALED IN THOSE GLOOMY DEPTHS
WILL BE PUT DOWN TO YOUR ACCOUNT VERY GOOD SAID HE OF THE GROVE GOD WILL SEND THE DAWN AND WE SHALL BE ALL RIGHT
AND IF SHE LEAVES YOU FREE TO DO YOURS YOU ARE IN LIKE MANNER TO RETURN AND SEEK ME OUT FOR THE TRAIL OF MY MIGHTY DEEDS WILL SERVE YOU AS A GUIDE TO LEAD YOU TO WHERE I MAY BE AND TELL ME WHAT MAY HAVE PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND HER CONDITIONS WHICH
GAUNT FEATURES LONG LANK LIMBS WITH HAIR TURNING GREY
IN ORDER THAT I MAY RESTRAIN AND MODERATE THE VEHEMENCE OF MY WRATH AND MAKE A GENTLE USE OF THE GLORY OF MY VICTORY
WHEN THEY ARE GODFATHERS IN ANY QUARREL NOT TO STAND IDLE WITH FOLDED ARMS WHILE THEIR GODSONS FIGHT I SAY SO TO REMIND YOU THAT WHILE OUR MASTERS ARE FIGHTING WE TOO HAVE TO FIGHT AND KNOCK ONE ANOTHER TO SHIVERS
AND WAS A THOUSAND TIMES ON THE POINT OF TELLING HIM HE LIED AND HAD THE LIE DIRECT ALREADY ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE BUT HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO CONFESS THE LIE WITH HIS OWN LIPS SO HE SAID TO HIM QUIETLY
THE INSTANT SANCHO SAW HIM FALL HE SLID DOWN FROM THE CORK TREE AND MADE ALL HASTE TO WHERE HIS MASTER WAS WHO DISMOUNTING FROM ROCINANTE
TO ENGAGE IN MANY PERILS OF VARIOUS SORTS AT THE END OF EACH PROMISING ME THAT WITH THE END OF THE NEXT THE OBJECT OF MY HOPES SHOULD BE ATTAINED BUT MY LABOURS HAVE GONE ON INCREASING LINK BY LINK UNTIL THEY ARE PAST COUNTING
LET OUR MASTERS FIGHT THAT'S THEIR LOOKOUT AND LET US DRINK AND LIVE FOR TIME WILL TAKE CARE TO EASE US OF OUR LIVES WITHOUT OUR GOING TO LOOK FOR FILLIPS SO THAT THEY MAY BE FINISHED OFF BEFORE THEIR PROPER TIME COMES AND THEY DROP FROM RIPENESS
INSOMUCH THAT HE SET HIM DOWN AS A MONSTER OF SOME KIND
SO HE RAN AFTER HIS MASTER HOLDING ON TO ROCINANTE'S STIRRUP LEATHER AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM TIME TO TURN ABOUT HE SAID I IMPLORE OF YOUR WORSHIP SENOR BEFORE YOU TURN TO CHARGE TO HELP ME UP INTO THIS CORK TREE
BUT AS YOU SAY ENCHANTERS PERSECUTE YOU I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY POSITIVELY WHETHER YOU ARE THE SAID PERSON OR NOT THAT SAID DON QUIXOTE IS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE UNDER A DECEPTION HOWEVER ENTIRELY TO RELIEVE YOU OF IT
WHO IN AN EQUALLY CALM VOICE SAID IN REPLY PLEDGES DON'T DISTRESS A GOOD PAYER HE WHO HAS SUCCEEDED IN VANQUISHING YOU ONCE WHEN TRANSFORMED SIR DON QUIXOTE
I LIFTED THE BULLS OF GUISANDO I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THE CAVERN AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE SECRETS OF ITS ABYSS AND MY HOPES ARE AS DEAD AS DEAD CAN BE AND HER SCORN AND HER COMMANDS AS LIVELY AS EVER TO BE BRIEF
STILL RETURNED HE OF THE GROVE
ONCE UPON A TIME CALLED ALDONZA LORENZO JUST AS I CALL MINE CASILDEA DE VANDALIA BECAUSE HER NAME IS CASILDA AND SHE IS OF ANDALUSIA IF ALL THESE TOKENS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO VINDICATE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY
HOOKED IN THE MIDDLE COVERED WITH WARTS
AND WHEN HE SAW THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BACHELOR CARRASCO HE FELL TO CROSSING HIMSELF A THOUSAND TIMES AND BLESSING HIMSELF AS MANY MORE ALL THIS TIME THE PROSTRATE KNIGHT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF LIFE
UNLESS INDEED IT BE THAT AS HE HAS MANY ENEMIES WHO ARE ENCHANTERS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR WHO IS ALWAYS PERSECUTING HIM SOME ONE OF THESE MAY HAVE TAKEN HIS SHAPE IN ORDER TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE VANQUISHED
FOR WHICH HIS HORSE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AS HE WAS ALREADY UNABLE TO GO DON QUIXOTE FANCYING THAT HIS FOE WAS COMING DOWN UPON HIM FLYING
RETURNED THE NOW UNNOSED SQUIRE TOM CECIAL I AM GOSSIP AND FRIEND SANCHO PANZA AND I'LL TELL YOU PRESENTLY THE MEANS AND TRICKS AND FALSEHOODS BY WHICH I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE BUT IN THE MEANTIME
OF WHOM WE ARE SO MUCH INCLINED TO HOPE GREAT THINGS THAT MOST OF US BEGIN ALREADY TO BELIEVE THEM THE YOUNG MAN IS HITHERTO BLAMELESS BUT IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT MUCH FROM THE IMMATURITY OF JUVENILE YEARS
THE MAN OF FEELING WAS ASSUMED BY MISTER ECCLES A YOUNG IRISH CLERGYMAN
FIRST CAME OUT HE DID NOT PUT HIS NAME TO THE POEM ROLT WENT OVER TO DUBLIN PUBLISHED AN EDITION OF IT AND PUT HIS OWN NAME TO IT UPON THE FAME OF THIS HE LIVED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
THOUGH PERHAPS I HAVE ENVIED OTHERS HIS COMPANY AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE OTHER NATIONS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE ENGLISH BY A TRAVELLER WHO HAS SO NICELY INSPECTED OUR MANNERS AND SO SUCCESSFULLY STUDIED OUR LITERATURE
AND CONSECRATED LIES FOR INSTANCE WE ARE TOLD THAT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEWS OF THE UNFORTUNATE BATTLE OF FONTENOY EVERY HEART BEAT AND EVERY EYE WAS IN TEARS NOW WE KNOW
THIS YEAR WAS THE SECOND EXHIBITION THEY PLEASE THEMSELVES MUCH WITH THE MULTITUDE OF SPECTATORS AND IMAGINE THAT THE ENGLISH SCHOOL WILL RISE IN REPUTATION REYNOLDS IS WITHOUT A RIVAL
WAS YET SO WELL ADAPTED TO THE STAGE AND SO WELL EXHIBITED BY THE ACTORS THAT IT WAS CROWDED FOR NEAR TWENTY NIGHTS I AM DIGRESSING FROM MYSELF TO THE PLAY HOUSE
TO USE TWO LANGUAGES FAMILIARLY AND WITHOUT CONTAMINATING ONE BY THE OTHER IS VERY DIFFICULT AND TO USE
AND HAVING MENTIONED THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO LONDON IN ORDER TO GET READY FOR THE PRESS IN ONE OF THE NUMBERS OF THAT JOURNAL FOOTE SAID TO HIM
WE WERE SO WEARY OF OUR OLD KING
AN ATTORNEY IN THE EXCHEQUER AT EDINBURGH WHO IS THE AUTHOUR OF SEVERAL OTHER INGENIOUS PIECES BUT THE BELIEF WITH REGARD TO MISTER ECCLES BECAME SO GENERAL THAT IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY
AT LEAST YOU WILL KNOW BY MY LETTERS WHATEVER ELSE THEY MAY HAVE OR WANT THAT I CONTINUE TO BE YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE FRIEND SAM JOHNSON
THAT HE HAD AT THIS PERIOD A FLOATING INTENTION OF WRITING A HISTORY OF THE RECENT AND WONDERFUL SUCCESSES OF THE BRITISH ARMS IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE FOR AMONG HIS RESOLUTIONS OR MEMORANDUMS SEPTEMBER EIGHTEENTH
A POETICAL EPISTLE TO SAMUEL JOHNSON A M IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTS JOHNSON IN A JUST AND ELEGANT MANNER
YOU SEE TO WHAT A TRAIN OF THOUGHT I AM DRAWN BY THE MENTION OF MYSELF LET ME NOW TURN MY ATTENTION UPON YOU I HOPE YOU TAKE CARE TO KEEP AN EXACT JOURNAL
BUT THE QUICKNESS OF YOUR DISCERNMENT
BUT I HAVE GONE THITHER ONLY TO ESCAPE FROM MYSELF WE HAVE HAD MANY NEW FARCES AND THE COMEDY CALLED
I HAVE NOT DISCOVERED A SINGLE PRIVATE LETTER WRITTEN BY HIM TO ANY OF HIS FRIENDS IT SHOULD SEEM HOWEVER
MISTER SHARPE IS OF OPINION THAT THE TEDIOUS MATURATION OF THE CATARACT IS A VULGAR ERROUR AND THAT IT MAY BE REMOVED AS SOON AS IT IS FORMED
SEVERAL INSTANCES OF SUCH LITERARY FRAUD HAVE BEEN DETECTED
THAT I DESIGN TO RECOMPENCE RARITY BY LENGTH A SHORT LETTER TO A DISTANT FRIEND IS IN MY OPINION AN INSULT LIKE THAT OF A SLIGHT BOW OR CURSORY SALUTATION A PROOF OF UNWILLINGNESS TO DO MUCH
MY CURIOSITY WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTED BY CONVENTS THAN BY PALACES THOUGH I AM AFRAID THAT I SHOULD FIND EXPECTATION IN BOTH PLACES EQUALLY DISAPPOINTED AND LIFE IN BOTH PLACES SUPPORTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND QUITTED WITH RELUCTANCE
HAVE BEEN ALL THIS CONCERN AND TO SAY THERE WAS
MAY BE RECKONED A CONSECRATED LIE
BUT WHAT ADVANCES HE MADE IN IT CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED HE CERTAINLY WAS AT THIS TIME NOT ACTIVE FOR IN HIS SCRUPULOUS EXAMINATION OF HIMSELF ON EASTER EVE HE LAMENTS IN HIS TOO RIGOROUS MODE OF CENSURING HIS OWN CONDUCT
THAT HIS LIFE SINCE THE COMMUNION OF THE PRECEDING EASTER HAD BEEN
OF DEAR MISSUS LANGTON YOU GIVE ME NO ACCOUNT
MISTER MURPHY HAVING READ THE TALE WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH IT AND FOLLOWED FOOTE'S ADVICE WHEN HE RETURNED TO TOWN THIS TALE WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM IN THE RAMBLER FROM WHENCE IT HAD BEEN TRANSLATED INTO THE FRENCH MAGAZINE
HOWEVER CONTRIBUTED THIS YEAR THE PREFACE TO ROLT'S DICTIONARY OF TRADE AND COMMERCE IN WHICH HE DISPLAYS SUCH A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT
EVEN WHERE THERE IS A NECESSITY OF DOING SOMETHING YET IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT HE WHO CONTINUES THE SAME COURSE OF LIFE IN THE SAME PLACE WILL HAVE LITTLE TO TELL ONE WEEK AND ONE YEAR
HAVE MORE MATERIALS FOR LETTERS THAN I WHO STAY AT HOME AND SHOULD THEREFORE WRITE WITH FREQUENCY EQUAL TO YOUR OPPORTUNITIES I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE ALL ENGLAND SURVEYED BY YOU IF YOU WOULD IMPART YOUR OBSERVATIONS IN NARRATIVES AS AGREEABLE AS YOUR LAST
AND THE IGNORANCE OF PRINCELY EDUCATION HE HAS BEEN LONG IN THE HANDS OF THE SCOTS AND HAS ALREADY FAVOURED THEM MORE THAN THE ENGLISH WILL CONTENTEDLY ENDURE
A ZEAL FOR TRUTH A DESIRE OF ESTABLISHING RIGHT IN OPPOSITION TO FASHION
YOU WILL FIND ME MENDED I DO NOT WONDER THAT WHERE THE MONASTICK LIFE IS PERMITTED EVERY ORDER FINDS VOTARIES AND EVERY MONASTERY INHABITANTS MEN WILL SUBMIT TO ANY RULE
THE FILIATION OF A LITERARY PERFORMANCE IS DIFFICULT OF PROOF SELDOM IS THERE ANY WITNESS PRESENT AT ITS BIRTH A MAN EITHER IN CONFIDENCE OR BY IMPROPER MEANS
WHO HAVE LITTLE OF EITHER IN COMMON LIFE CAN EXHIBIT ON THE STAGE HIS VOICE WHEN STRAINED IS UNPLEASING AND WHEN LOW IS NOT ALWAYS HEARD
YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME TO WOOLWICH AND LET YOUR FRIENDS HELP YOU I SAID FEELING PROVOKED WITH HIM FOR HIDING HIMSELF NO MA'AM HE ANSWERED WITH A LOOK I NEVER SHALL FORGET
EXCEPT A COUPLE OF OLD SHIRTS AND THEM SOCKS MY HAT'S STOPPIN UP THE WINDER AND MY OLD COAT IS MY BED COVER I'M AWFUL SHABBY MA'AM AND THAT'S ONE REASON I DON'T GO OUT MORE
EVEN IN A STRANGE CITY THERE WAS SOME ONE TO SAY GOD BLESS YOU JOE WE WATCHED THE TALLEST BLUE CAP TILL IT VANISHED AND THEN WENT HOME IN A GLOW OF PATRIOTISM
LITTLE OF THE GLAMOUR OF ROMANCE ABOUT THE WAR NOW THEY SAW IT AS IT WAS A LONG HARD TASK AND HERE WERE THE MEN TO DO IT WELL EVEN THE LOOKERS ON WERE DIFFERENT NOW
WHILE TOM WAS GONE I FOUND OUT JOE'S NAME AND BUSINESS PROMISED TO WRITE AND TELL HIS MOTHER HOW FINELY THE REGIMENT WENT OFF AND WAS JUST EXPRESSING A HOPE THAT WE MIGHT MEET AGAIN
AND WE WERE HURRYING TO GET THE POOR FELLOWS INTO MUCH NEEDED BEDS AFTER A WEEK OF HUNGER COLD AND UNAVOIDABLE NEGLECT ALL FORMS OF PAIN WERE IN MY WARD THAT NIGHT
I OFFERED HIM MY LAST APPLE WITH A WORD OF INTEREST THE KEEN BLUE EYES MET MINE GRATEFULLY AND THE APPLE BEGAN TO VANISH IN VIGOROUS BITES AS WE TALKED FOR NO ONE THOUGHT OF CEREMONY AT SUCH A TIME
AND JOE CRADLED THE CHUBBY BABY IN HIS ONE ARM AS TENDERLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN THOUGH LITTLE BIDDY WAS NOT AN INVITING INFANT THAT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND RIGHT JOE
TO THINK AND SPEAK OFTEN OF POOR JOE COLLINS AND HIS LUCINDY ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO BUT IT IS WELL TO RECALL THOSE STIRRING TIMES
TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT OF ONE OF THE GREATEST MISFORTUNES A MAN CAN SUFFER THAT IS BAD BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
I EXCLAIMED POURING THE LAST SPOONFUL OF SOUP DOWN HIS THROAT SO HASTILY THAT I CHOKED HIM ALL THAT'S LEFT OF ME
I COULD NOT SPEAK TO HIM AND ENCUMBERED WITH BABY DISH SPOON AND CHILDREN HE COULD ONLY STARE AT ME WITH A SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THE ALTERED FACE THAT MADE IT FULL OF WELCOME BEFORE A WORD WAS UTTERED
BUT I THINK HE WILL PULL THROUGH AS HE IS A TEMPERATE FELLOW WITH A SPLENDID CONSTITUTION WAS THE DOCTOR'S VERDICT AS HE LEFT US FOR THE NEXT MAN WHO WAS PAST HELP WITH A BULLET THROUGH HIS LUNGS
WHEN THE ORDER TO FALL IN CAME ROLLING DOWN THE RANKS AND THE TALK WAS OVER FEARING TOM WOULD MISS OUR MAN IN THE CONFUSION I KEPT MY EYE ON HIM TILL THE BOY CAME RUSHING UP WITH A PACKET OF TOBACCO IN ONE HAND
DO YOU LEAVE A FAMILY MY OLD MOTHER A SICK BROTHER AND LUCINDY THE LAST WORD WAS UTTERED IN A TONE OF INTENSE REGRET
AND TO FIND TEARS IN MANY EYES BESIDE MY OWN WHEN HE WAS GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT OF HIM BUT THE EMPTY COT THE OLD GRAY WRAPPER AND THE NAME UPON THE WALL
AND DO IT HEARTY BUT IT IS ROUGH ON A FELLER LEAVIN HIS FOLKS FOR GOOD MAYBE THERE WAS A SUDDEN HUSKINESS IN THE MAN'S VOICE THAT WAS NOT APPLE SKINS THOUGH HE TRIED TO MAKE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS
I ASKED MISSUS FLANAGIN HOW SHE MANAGED TO KEEP HIM AND SHE SAID SHE HAD HELP WHILE HE WAS SICK AND NOW HE IS ABLE TO HOBBLE ABOUT HE TAKES CARE OF THE CHILDREN SO SHE IS ABLE TO GO OUT TO WORK
AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE
GIVE HIM A CHEER AUNTIE HE SEES US AND REMEMBERS CRIED TOM NEARLY TUMBLING OFF HIS PERCH AS HE WAVED HIS HAT AND POINTED OUT JOE COLLINS
THE WOUND IN THE HEAD FEVERISH FOR WANT OF CARE AND A HEAVY COLD ON THE LUNGS SUGGESTED PNEUMONIA AS AN ADDED TRIAL TO HIS LIST OF ILLS HE WILL HAVE A HARD TIME OF IT
THE LONG LEGS THE FADED COAT THE LOW WHISTLE WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DODGING A WET SHEET I FACED THE MAN TO FIND IT WAS INDEED MY JOE A MERE SHADOW OF HIS FORMER SELF
I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE JOE AGAIN BUT SIX MONTHS LATER WE DID MEET IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL ONE WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAIN OF AMBULANCES HAD LEFT THEIR SAD FREIGHT AT OUR DOOR
FOR HE WAS A FAVORITE AND BETTER STILL HE MADE SUNSHINE IN THAT SAD PLACE BY THE BRAVE PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE BORE HIS OWN TROUBLES THE CHEERFUL CONSOLATION HE ALWAYS GAVE TO OTHERS
AND FELT THAT IT WAS VERY HARD HE COULD NOT HAVE LIVED TO ENJOY THE PROMISED REFUGE FOR RELYING UPON THE CHARITY THAT NEVER FAILS THE HOME WAS AN ACTUAL FACT NOW JUST BEGINNING ITS BENEFICENT CAREER
AS WELL IT MIGHT FOR THE CHANGE FROM THAT DAMP NURSERY TO THE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS PREPARED FOR HIM WOULD BE LIKE GOING FROM PURGATORY TO PARADISE I DON'T WONDER YOU DON'T GET WELL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE JOE
ALL LAUGHING AT THE FLURRY WHILE LESS FORTUNATE COMRADES HELPED US WITH AN EYE TO A SHARE OF THESE FRAGRANT LUXURIES BY AND BY THERE WAS JUST TIME FOR THIS A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE BIG HAND AND A GRATEFUL GOOD BY MA'AM
THAT MADE ME LONG TO RUSH OUT AND BUY UP HALF THE CONTENTS OF OAK HALL ON THE SPOT CURBING THIS WILD IMPULSE I PRESENTLY DEPARTED WITH PROMISES OF SPEEDY TRANSPORTATION FOR JOE
SO THE POOR CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO THE ALTAR AND THE PRIEST STOOD READY WITH HIS KNIFE WHEN OUT OF THE CLOUDS CAME THE GOLDEN RAM AND TOOK THEM ON HIS BACK AND VANISHED THEN MADNESS CAME UPON THAT FOOLISH KING ATHAMAS
AND RUIN UPON INO AND HER CHILDREN FOR ATHAMAS KILLED ONE OF THEM IN HIS FURY AND INO FLED FROM HIM WITH THE OTHER IN HER ARMS AND LEAPED FROM A CLIFF INTO THE SEA AND WAS CHANGED INTO A DOLPHIN SUCH AS YOU HAVE SEEN
MISS WINIFRED WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER BROTHER ALL THE WHILE AND CRYING HEARTILY WHICH WAS HER WAY OF REJOICING SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS AND SAID YOU MUST SET ME THE EXAMPLE CAM YOU MUST MARRY NOW WITH ALL MY HEART
AND A ESON WHEN HE WAS DRIVEN OUT WENT SADLY AWAY OUT OF THE TOWN LEADING HIS LITTLE SON BY THE HAND AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST HIDE THE CHILD IN THE MOUNTAINS OR PELIAS WILL SURELY KILL HIM BECAUSE HE IS THE HEIR
OUR DISCOVERERS DID NOT GO TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH WHEN THEY SAILED OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER INTO THE DREARY FROZEN SEAS NOR DID THE LADIES WHO WENT OUT LAST YEAR TO DRUDGE IN THE HOSPITALS OF THE EAST MAKING THEMSELVES POOR THAT THEY MIGHT BE RICH IN NOBLE WORKS
AND WHISPERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE SNAKE CAST ITS OLD SKIN AND GROW YOUNG AGAIN BEFORE HIS EYES AND HOW HE HAD GONE DOWN INTO A VILLAGE IN THE VALE AND CURED A DYING MAN WITH A HERB WHICH HE HAD SEEN A SICK GOAT EAT
YOU MUST SAIL OVER THE SEA TO COLCHIS AND BRING HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN MY SPIRIT WILL COME BACK WITH IT AND I SHALL SLEEP WITH MY FATHERS AND HAVE REST HE CAME THUS AND CALLED TO THEM OFTEN BUT WHEN THEY WOKE THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID
I SHALL HAVE TWO PARISHES SAID THE VICAR PREFERRING NOT TO DISCUSS THE VIRTUES OF THAT GAME HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO DOROTHEA I DON'T FEEL BOUND TO GIVE UP SAINT BOTOLPH'S IT IS PROTEST ENOUGH AGAINST THE PLURALISM THEY WANT TO REFORM IF I GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE MOST OF THE MONEY
BUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFE OF MORE LIVES THAN ONE I THINK IT WOULD BE THE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT
SHE HAD ONLY TIME TO FEEL THAT ALL THIS WAS HAZY AND PERHAPS ILLUSORY BUT ONE THING WAS CLEAR AND DETERMINED HER ANSWER SINCE YOU THINK IT MY DUTY MISTER FAREBROTHER I WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE TOO STRONG A FEELING FOR FRED TO GIVE HIM UP FOR ANY ONE ELSE
SHE WOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKE POULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE ME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TO GO DEEPER FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS
BUT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS A CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH ALL THIS GOOD CANNOT COME TO PASS HE HAS OPENED HIS HEART TO ME MISS GARTH AND ASKED ME TO PLEAD FOR HIM THE CONDITION LIES ENTIRELY IN YOUR FEELING
BUT AT ITS FOOT AROUND THE CAVE'S MOUTH GREW ALL FAIR FLOWERS AND HERBS AS IF IN A GARDEN
NO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU IN THIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO HER I MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED
BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOME OTHER WAY WILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE MAY HE COUNT ON WINNING YOU I THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID TO HIM
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE BEFORE MISTER FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORK AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAID VERY WELL MY BOY I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH THAT VERY DAY MISTER FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICH HE HAD JUST SET UP
I SHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OF ME
MISS GARTH I SUPPOSE SAID THE VICAR EXAMINING SOME LABELS VERY CLOSELY YES I SHOULDN'T MIND ANYTHING IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME AND I KNOW I COULD BE A GOOD FELLOW THEN AND YOU THINK SHE RETURNS THE FEELING
FOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR CONSCIENCE FRED
WHICH WANDERS OVER THE WAVES FOR EVER SIGHING WITH ITS LITTLE ONE CLASPED TO ITS BREAST BUT THE PEOPLE DROVE OUT KING ATHAMAS BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED HIS CHILD AND HE ROAMED ABOUT IN HIS MISERY TILL HE CAME TO THE ORACLE IN DELPHI
AND THERE WERE DARK AND SAD TALES ABOUT HIS BIRTH WHEN HE WAS A BABE HE WAS CAST OUT ON THE MOUNTAINS AND A WILD MARE CAME BY AND KICKED HIM BUT A SHEPHERD PASSING FOUND THE BABY WITH ITS FACE ALL BLACKENED BY THE BLOW
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSED HER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPED SHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MISTER FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE
OF COURSE IF I AM OBLIGED TO BE A CLERGYMAN I SHALL TRY AND DO MY DUTY THOUGH I MAYN'T LIKE IT
SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHER YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MAN AS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED
BUT DUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIEND WHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHIN OUR GATES HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FRED VINCY
SIT HERE BY ME TILL SUNDOWN WHEN YOUR PLAYFELLOWS WILL COME HOME AND YOU SHALL LEARN LIKE THEM TO BE A KING WORTHY TO RULE OVER GALLANT MEN
MIXED UP NO DOUBT WITH DREAMS AND FABLES AND YET TRUE AND RIGHT AT HEART SO WE WILL HONOUR THESE OLD ARGONAUTS AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORY AS IT STANDS AND WE WILL TRY TO BE LIKE THEM EACH OF US IN OUR PLACE
THE YOUNG GROWTHS ARE PUSHING ME ASIDE HE FOUND MARY IN THE GARDEN GATHERING ROSES AND SPRINKLING THE PETALS ON A SHEET THE SUN WAS LOW AND TALL TREES SENT THEIR SHADOWS ACROSS THE GRASSY WALKS WHERE MARY WAS MOVING WITHOUT BONNET OR PARASOL
AND OFTENER AFFECT TO BE BUT IT IS CERTAIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME INDEFENSIBLE TREACHERY TO WOMEN AND HAD IN A CERTAIN MYSTERY CALLED MAKING LOVE PRACTISED MANY DECEITS WHICH IF HE HAD USED IN TRADE
NEVERTHELESS WE WILL REMARK CURSORILY THERE IS STILL AN ABYSS BETWEEN THESE RACES OF MEN AND THE HIDEOUS ASSASSIN OF THE TOWNS THE POACHER LIVES IN THE FOREST THE SMUGGLER LIVES IN THE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE SEA
SO ORLANDO AND ROSALIND WERE MARRIED AND OLIVER AND CELIA AND THEY LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER RETURNING WITH THE DUKE TO THE KINGDOM FOR FREDERICK HAD BEEN SHOWN BY A HOLY HERMIT THE WICKEDNESS OF HIS WAYS AND SO GAVE BACK THE DUKEDOM OF HIS BROTHER
I KNOW NOT THROUGH WHAT CHANNELS THE NEWS REACHED HIM SOME ONE WHO HAD KNOWN THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HAD SEEN HIS SISTER SHE WAS IN PARIS
WAS A SISTER OLDER THAN HIMSELF A WIDOW WITH SEVEN CHILDREN BOYS AND GIRLS THIS SISTER HAD BROUGHT UP JEAN VALJEAN AND SO LONG AS SHE HAD A HUSBAND SHE LODGED AND FED HER YOUNG BROTHER THE HUSBAND DIED
NIGHTINGALE ANSWERED WHAT THE DEVIL WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO
CALLING HER IN DERISION A GENTLEWOMAN THAT I BELIEVE SHE AT LENGTH BROKE THE HEART OF THE POOR GIRL IN SHORT SHE LIKEWISE DIED WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AFTER MY FATHER FORTUNE THOUGHT PROPER TO PROVIDE BETTER FOR ME
NOR WOULD I TO PROCURE PLEASURE TO MYSELF BE KNOWINGLY THE CAUSE OF MISERY TO ANY HUMAN BEING WELL WELL SAID NIGHTINGALE I BELIEVE YOU AND I AM CONVINCED YOU ACQUIT ME OF ANY SUCH THING
JEAN VALJEAN WAS OF THAT THOUGHTFUL BUT NOT GLOOMY DISPOSITION WHICH CONSTITUTES THE PECULIARITY OF AFFECTIONATE NATURES ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER
CROUCHED DOWN AND DOUBLED UP OVER HIS BASKET WHEN IT RAINED AN OLD WOMAN THE PORTRESS TOOK PITY ON HIM SHE TOOK HIM INTO HER DEN WHERE THERE WAS A PALLET A SPINNING WHEEL AND TWO WOODEN CHAIRS AND THE LITTLE ONE SLUMBERED IN A CORNER
A BIT OF MEAT A SLICE OF BACON THE HEART OF THE CABBAGE TO GIVE TO ONE OF HER CHILDREN AS HE WENT ON EATING WITH HIS HEAD BENT OVER THE TABLE AND ALMOST INTO HIS SOUP HIS LONG HAIR FALLING ABOUT HIS BOWL AND CONCEALING HIS EYES
THE FAMILY HAD NO BREAD NO BREAD LITERALLY SEVEN CHILDREN
HELPLESS FRIENDLESS ORPHANS TO THE CARE OR RATHER TO THE CRUELTY OF THE WORLD YOU MUST KNOW SIR THOUGH I AM NOW REDUCED TO GET MY LIVING BY LETTING LODGINGS I WAS BORN AND BRED A GENTLEWOMAN MY FATHER WAS AN OFFICER OF THE ARMY
HIS SISTER WORKED ALSO BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO WITH SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN IT WAS A SAD GROUP ENVELOPED IN MISERY WHICH WAS BEING GRADUALLY ANNIHILATED A VERY HARD WINTER CAME JEAN HAD NO WORK
DUKE FREDERICK WAS PLEASED WITH HIS COURAGE AND ASKED HIS NAME MY NAME IS ORLANDO AND I AM THE YOUNGEST SON OF SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOW SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
HE HAD NEITHER EATEN NOR SLEPT FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS THE MARITIME TRIBUNAL CONDEMNED HIM FOR THIS CRIME TO A PROLONGATION OF HIS TERM FOR THREE YEARS WHICH MADE EIGHT YEARS
FOR THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS TO OCCUPY THAT WHICH WAS BETWEEN THEM THIS NIGHTINGALE OF WHOM WE SHALL BE PRESENTLY OBLIGED TO SAY A LITTLE MORE WAS IN THE ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS OF LIFE A MAN OF STRICT HONOUR
HE THEN TOLD NIGHTINGALE HE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO LODGE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY AGREED BETWEEN THEM THAT NIGHTINGALE SHOULD PROCURE HIM EITHER THE GROUND FLOOR
THAT IS TO SAY THE LARGER HALF OF A SHOULDER OF MUTTON
HE FOUGHT WITH THE LIONESS AND KILLED HER AND SAVED HIS BROTHER'S LIFE WHILE ORLANDO WAS FIGHTING THE LIONESS OLIVER WOKE TO SEE HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAD TREATED SO BADLY SAVING HIM FROM A WILD BEAST AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE
TOM TOM ANSWERED NIGHTINGALE LAST NIGHT REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WHEN EVERY EYE WAS CLOSED AND THE PALE MOON AND SILENT STARS SHONE CONSCIOUS OF THE THEFT LOOKEE MISTER NIGHTINGALE SAID JONES
IN THE SOMBRE MARCH OF THE HUMAN RACE THEY QUITTED THE COUNTRY THE CLOCK TOWER OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR VILLAGE FORGOT THEM THE BOUNDARY LINE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR FIELD FORGOT THEM AFTER A FEW YEARS RESIDENCE IN THE GALLEYS
SO I AM GOING TO PALL MALL AND DO YOU INTEND TO MAKE A SECRET OF YOUR GOING AWAY SAID JONES I PROMISE YOU ANSWERED NIGHTINGALE I DON'T INTEND TO BILK MY LODGINGS BUT I HAVE A PRIVATE REASON FOR NOT TAKING A FORMAL LEAVE
SAID CELIA WRESTLE WITH THY AFFECTIONS OH ANSWERED ROSALIND THEY TAKE THE PART OF A BETTER WRESTLER THAN MYSELF LOOK HERE COMES THE DUKE WITH HIS EYES FULL OF ANGER SAID CELIA
WHO HATH BEEN UP HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO TO GIVE ME WARNING THE GOOD WOMAN IS AFRAID IT SEEMS OF THE REPUTATION OF HER DAUGHTERS OH SHE IS WONDERFULLY NICE SAYS NIGHTINGALE UPON THAT ACCOUNT
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY THE TERMS OF THE CODE WERE EXPLICIT THERE OCCUR FORMIDABLE HOURS IN OUR CIVILIZATION THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE PENAL LAWS DECREE A SHIPWRECK
WAS ANNOUNCED IN PARIS ON THAT SAME DAY A GREAT GANG OF GALLEY SLAVES WAS PUT IN CHAINS AT BICETRE JEAN VALJEAN FORMED A PART OF THAT GANG AN OLD TURNKEY OF THE PRISON WHO IS NOW NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS OLD
HE NEVER MET THEM AGAIN AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS MOURNFUL HISTORY THEY WILL NOT BE MET WITH ANY MORE TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FOURTH YEAR JEAN VALJEAN'S TURN TO ESCAPE ARRIVED
AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT PUNISHED IN PRUNING SEASON HE EARNED EIGHTEEN SOUS A DAY THEN HE HIRED OUT AS A HAY MAKER AS LABORER AS NEAT HERD ON A FARM AS A DRUDGE HE DID WHATEVER HE COULD
MY LOVE WHY DID THAT STRANGER BRING THEE BACK TO ME AFTER THIS SORT FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I HAVE NOT SUFFERED THUS OH IF I SINNED AGAINST THEE HAVE I NOT WIPED AWAY THE SIN WHEN WILT THOU COME BACK TO ME WHO HAVE ALL
FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD THERE BROODING AND THEN CAST HERSELF DOWN ON HER KNEES BESIDE THE FORM AND BEGAN TO PRESS HER LIPS AGAINST THE SHEET AND WEEP THERE WAS SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE ABOUT THE SIGHT OF THIS AWE INSPIRING WOMAN LETTING LOOSE HER PASSION ON THE DEAD
FOR IN THE BOWELS OF THE ROCK IT WOULD BE AS DARK AT MIDDAY AS AT MIDNIGHT I LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER NOT A SIGHT OR A SOUND I PEERED FORWARD INTO THE DARKNESS SURELY FAR AWAY I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THE FAINT GLOW OF FIRE
SHE HAD WARNED ME FAIRLY AND I HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE WARNING CURSES ON THE FATAL CURIOSITY THAT IS EVER PROMPTING MAN TO DRAW THE VEIL FROM WOMAN AND CURSES ON THE NATURAL IMPULSE THAT BEGETS IT IT IS THE CAUSE OF HALF
AND AS THEY DID SO SHE SPOKE OR RATHER HISSED IN ARABIC IN A NOTE THAT CURDLED MY BLOOD AND FOR A SECOND STOPPED MY HEART CURSE HER
ACCORDING TO YOUR MINDS WELL DO YE KNOW IT YE WICKED ONES BUT YE ARE ALL EVIL EVIL TO THE CORE THE WICKEDNESS BUBBLES UP IN YOU LIKE A FOUNTAIN IN THE SPRING TIME WERE IT NOT FOR ME GENERATIONS SINCE HAD YE CEASED TO BE
NEXT HE LOOKED AT THE POTS FULL OF WATER WHICH CONSTITUTED OUR WASHING APPARATUS
AND I THEN AND THERE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF IT WERE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE I WOULD GET SHE TO COME AND SEE HIM SURELY SHE WOULD CURE HIM IF SHE CHOSE AT ANY RATE SHE SAID SHE COULD WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM BILLALI ENTERED AND ALSO SHOOK HIS HEAD
I A FELLOW OF MY COLLEGE NOTED FOR WHAT MY ACQUAINTANCES ARE PLEASED TO CALL MY MISOGYNY AND A RESPECTABLE MAN NOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE HAD FALLEN ABSOLUTELY AND HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH THIS WHITE SORCERESS NONSENSE IT MUST BE NONSENSE
HE WILL DIE AT NIGHT HE SAID GOD FORBID MY FATHER I ANSWERED AND TURNED AWAY WITH A HEAVY HEART SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED COMMANDS THY PRESENCE MY BABOON SAID THE OLD MAN AS SOON AS WE GOT TO THE CURTAIN
BUT I SAW IT WRITTEN ON HIS FACE THAT HE HAD BUT LITTLE HOPE OF MERCY THEN CAME A PAUSE AND THE MOST INTENSE SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE WHOLE SCENE WHICH ILLUMINATED AS IT WAS BY THE FLICKER OF THE LAMPS STRIKING OUT BROAD PATTERNS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW UPON THE ROCKY WALLS
IT IS NOT SO THOU HAST SEEN HOW IN THE HEAVENS THE LITTLE CLOUDS BLOW THIS WAY AND THAT WITHOUT A CAUSE YET BEHIND THEM IS THE GREAT WIND SWEEPING ON ITS PATH WHITHER IT LISTETH SO IT IS WITH ME OH HOLLY MY MOODS AND CHANGES ARE THE LITTLE CLOUDS
I WAS SO INTENSELY INTERESTED IN THE WHOLE WEIRD STORY THAT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHATTERED STATE OF MY NERVES I ASKED NOTHING BETTER EVEN IF MY LIFE PAID FORFEIT TO MY CURIOSITY
HE PLACED IT ON A LEOPARD SKIN ON THE FLOOR AND STOOD BACK A STEP OR TWO TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT IT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY SO HE SHUT UP THE BAG TURNED IT ON END AND HAVING RESTED IT AGAINST THE FOOT OF THE COUCH PLACED THE DRESSING CASE ON IT
MIDDLE AGED AND HIDEOUS HAVE AGAINST HIS BRIGHT YOUTH AND BEAUTY WELL THANK HEAVEN MY SENSE OF RIGHT WAS NOT DEAD SHE HAD NOT KILLED THAT YET AND AS I STOOD THERE I PRAYED TO HEAVEN IN MY HEART THAT MY BOY MY MORE THAN SON MIGHT LIVE
FEELING IN MY TREMBLING HEART THAT I HAD SEEN A VISION OF A SOUL IN HELL ON I STUMBLED I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TWICE I FELL ONCE I TURNED UP THE BISECTING PASSAGE BUT FORTUNATELY FOUND OUT MY MISTAKE IN TIME
SOME WERE GHASTLY SOME RECALLED THOUGHTS AND SENSATIONS THAT HAD FOR YEARS BEEN BURIED IN THE DEBRIS OF MY PAST LIFE BUT BEHIND AND ABOVE THEM ALL HOVERED THE SHAPE OF THAT AWFUL WOMAN AND THROUGH THEM GLEAMED THE MEMORY OF HER ENTRANCING LOVELINESS
SO MUCH MORE HORRIBLE EVEN THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD GONE BEFORE THAT I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO LOOK AT IT AND TURNING BEGAN TO CREEP SHAKING AS I WAS IN EVERY LIMB SLOWLY ALONG THE PITCH DARK PASSAGE
LET MY POWER FIND HER EVEN THERE LET HER HEAR ME EVEN THERE LET HER HIDE HERSELF IN THE BLACKNESS LET HER GO DOWN INTO THE PIT OF DESPAIR BECAUSE I SHALL ONE DAY FIND HER
THE WHITE ROBE SLIPPED FROM HER DOWN TO HER GOLDEN GIRDLE BARING THE BLINDING LOVELINESS OF HER FORM SHE STOOD THERE HER FINGERS CLENCHED AND THE AWFUL LOOK OF MALEVOLENCE GATHERED AND DEEPENED ON HER FACE
SUDDENLY SHE CEASED RAISED HERSELF TO HER FEET REARRANGED HER ROBE AND TOSSING BACK HER LONG LOCKS IMPATIENTLY SWEPT ACROSS TO WHERE THE FIGURE LAY UPON THE STONE
AND IF SO COULD IT BE THAT LEO WAS THE MAN THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE DEAD MAN WHO WAS TO BE BORN AGAIN IMPOSSIBLE THE WHOLE THING WAS GIBBERISH WHO EVER HEARD OF A MAN BEING BORN AGAIN
THAT HER VOICE HAD THE POWER OF SUITING ITSELF IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TO THE MOOD OF THE MOMENT WHAT HAVE YE TO SAY YE REBELLIOUS CHILDREN WHY VENGEANCE SHOULD NOT BE DONE UPON YOU FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE MEN
TWO THOUSAND YEARS SHE MOANED
AND I TREMBLED AT THE NAME I MUST LOOK UPON THY FACE AGAIN THOUGH IT BE AGONY IT IS A GENERATION SINCE I LOOKED UPON THEE WHOM I SLEW SLEW WITH MINE OWN HAND
IN WHOM I RECOGNISED SHE HERSELF SHE MOUNTED THE DAIS AND SAT DOWN UPON THE CHAIR AND SPOKE TO ME IN GREEK I SUPPOSE BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WISH THOSE PRESENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SAID COME HITHER OH HOLLY SHE SAID AND SIT THOU AT MY FEET
AND WITH MY SIN EVER BEFORE ME OH THAT FOR ME LIFE CANNOT BRING FORGETFULNESS OH FOR THE WEARY YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE YET TO COME AND EVERMORE TO COME ENDLESS AND WITHOUT END MY LOVE MY LOVE
AND SEE ME DO JUSTICE ON THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEE FORGIVE ME IF MY GREEK DOTH HALT LIKE A LAME MAN IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF IT THAT MY TONGUE IS STIFF AND WILL NOT BEND RIGHTLY TO THE WORDS I BOWED AND MOUNTING THE DAIS
HE WAS A PERFECT DUB TO HAVE LET THE SITUATION REACH SUCH A STAGE OF COMPLEXITY THOUGH THE ONE THOUGHT UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND WAS TO SAVE HELEN FROM PUBLIC RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT
WHICH ONLY DEATH COULD HEAL J W BELL WAS A TALL SLENDER MAN OF MIDDLE AGE WITH A LARGE KNIFE SCAR ACROSS ONE CHEEK HE HAD COME FROM SAN ANTONIO TEXAS
NOW SHE WILL DESPISE ME AND FORGET ME IT IS BETTER THAT SHE SHOULD THINK ME A BRUTE THAN THAT I SHOULD BE ALWAYS HAUNTED BY THOSE PLEADING EYES THE DOOR OF THE DISTANT CHURCH HOUSE OPENED AND CLOSED
HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS AWFUL PURPOSE BUT THE CLIMAX HAD BEEN ANTI CLIMAX AND PHELAN HAD GROUND HIS TEETH IN RAGE
THESE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF THE GUARD'S MOUTH WHEN THE KID FIRED A CHARGE OF BUCKSHOT INTO HIS HEART NOW BILLY THE KID HOBBLED BACK TO THE ARMORY AND BUCKLED AROUND HIS WAIST TWO BELTS OF CARTRIDGES
IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THIS ROOM ONE HAD TO PASS THROUGH A HALL INTO ANOTHER ROOM WHERE A BACK STAIRS LED DOWN TO THE REAR YARD IN A ROOM IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE BUILDING
TWO BELTS FULL OF AMMUNITION AND THE RIFLE THE KID WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND WHEN THE PONY BEGAN BUCKING BEFORE HE HAD GOT INTO THE SADDLE NOW THE KID FACED THE CROWD ACROSS THE STREET HOLDING THE RIFLE READY FOR ACTION
THEN SUDDENLY THE HUGE MAN STOOPED AND HELD UP IN PLAIN VIEW A DANGLING WRESTLING DUMMY THE LONE WATCHER SWALLOWED A SAVAGE OATH
HE AND THE KID WERE BITTER ENEMIES ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING KILLED WARM FRIENDS OF EACH OTHER DURING THE BLOODY LINCOLN COUNTY WAR IT IS SAID THAT OLLINGER SHOT ONE OF THE KID'S FRIENDS TO DEATH
COWBOY CHARLIE WALL HAD FOUR MEXICANS HELPING HIM IRRIGATE AN ALFALFA FIELD ABOVE THE MEXICAN VILLAGE OF TULAROSA ON TULAROSA RIVER A LARGE BAND OF TULAROSA MEXICANS APPEARED ON THE SCENE ONE MORNING
THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT THIS AMAZING CROOK MIGHT DO NOW HE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM THAT A THIEF AND IMPOSTOR COULD POSSESS SUCH SUPERHUMAN NERVE HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS UNTUTORED MIND
HE TOOK NO NOTICE AFTER THAT SO THE ACT SEEMED LESS LIKE A CARESS THAN A MATTER OF COURSE HE BEGAN TO TALK HALF HUMOROUSLY AND LITTLE BY LITTLE AS HE WENT ON SHE FORGOT HER FEARS
SHE THINKS I AM A BRUTE HOW SHE SOBBED AS THOUGH HER LITTLE HEART HAD BROKEN WELL IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY HER INTEREST IN ME I HAD TO DO IT
THEN FELL HEAVILY ASLEEP SO THAT EVEN THE DOGS FIGHTING OVER US DID NOT AWAKEN US TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT WE BOILED TEA
WHEN THE PONY STOOD ON THE STREET READY FOR THE LAST ACT THE KID WENT DOWN THE BACK STAIRS STEPPING OVER THE DEAD BODY OF BELL AND STARTED TO MOUNT BEING ENCUMBERED WITH THE WEIGHT OF TWO PISTOLS
YOU BET YOUR LIFE I WON'T PHELAN ANSWERED THOUGH HE WAS ALREADY BLUFFED I'LL STICK CLOSE TO YEZ HE FALTERED INCHING UNCERTAINLY TOWARD THE THIEF
THIS TIME HE WAS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO HANG ON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE COURT HOUSE YARD IN LINCOLN
NOW BELL RAN OUT OF THE DOOR AND RECEIVED A BULLET FROM HIS OWN PISTOL THE BODY OF BELL TUMBLED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS FALLING ON THE JAILER A GERMAN BY THE NAME OF GEISS WHO WAS SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
REMAINING A VERITABLE HERO OF ROMANCE TO SOOTH AND CONSOLE HELEN
IN A TONE THAT WAS FAR MORE CONVINCING THAT GLADWIN'S MOST PASSIONATE SINCERITY NOW BE CAREFUL OFFICER OR YOU'LL GET YOURSELF INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE DON'T LET HIM BLUFF YOU PHELAN CAUTIONED GLADWIN
I FEEL IT YOU ARE BRAVE AND USED TO TRAVEL WON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT HE DID NOT REPLY AFTER A MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE
CHARLIE WALL AND THE FOUR MEXICANS STOPPED ON THE SIDEWALK WHILE OLLINGER CONTINUED TO RUN TOWARDS THE COURT HOUSE AFTER KILLING BELL THE KID BROKE IN THE DOOR TO THE ARMORY AND SECURED OLLINGER'S SHOT GUN
HER CONSCIOUSNESS SWIM HER OLD TERROR RETURNING LISTEN SAID HE I MAY COME TO YOU TO MORROW AND ASK YOU TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOUR DIVINE PITY AND WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK TO BE YOUR DUTY
J W BELL SAT ON A CHAIR FACING THE KID SEVERAL PACES AWAY HE WAS READING A NEWSPAPER THE KID SLIPPED HIS LEFT HAND OUT OF THE CUFF AND MADE A SPRING FOR THE GUARD
BUT AS HE WENT ON IN SHORT CURT SENTENCES THE PICTURE GREW MORE DISTINCT AND TO VIRGINIA THE MAN BECAME MORE AND MORE PROMINENT IN IT SHE SAW THE DYING AND EXHAUSTED DOGS
HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF BURSTING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND SOMEHOW SCRAMBLING ALOFT TO THE RESCUE OF THAT HELPLESS BEING WHO WAS BEING GROUND AND WRENCHED AND POUNDED BY THAT PORCINE MONSTER
IT WAS VERY COLD THEN SAID NED TRENT AND VERY HARD
WHAT THE BLAZES KIND OF A JOKE IS THIS BLURTED PHELAN LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT YOU'LL FIND IT'S NO JOKE OFFICER SAID THE BOGUS GLADWIN SHARPLY NOT IF HE GETS AWAY
BECAUSE I LOVE IT IT IS MY LIFE I WANT TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS SET FOOT BEFORE ME I WANT TO STAND ALONE UNDER THE SKY I WANT TO SHOW MYSELF THAT NOTHING IS TOO BIG FOR ME
WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
THOUGHT MADE ORIGINAL SINS SYSTEM CULTIVATED HUMAN WRONGS INSTITUTIONALIZED TEACHINGS OF ERROR BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THE UNIVERSE IS ONE UNDIVIDED SOUL YOU ARE A YOKE FELLOW WITH GOD
LOOK BACK WITH SERENE HAPPINESS ON THEIR FAILURES THE TURNING OF THE FACE OF TIME SHOWS ALL THINGS IN A WONDROUSLY ILLUMINATED AND SATISFYING PERSPECTIVE MANY A MAN IS THANKFUL TO DAY THAT SOME PETTY SUCCESS FOR WHICH HE ONCE STRUGGLED
LOVE IS THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW YOUTH IS SUPREME CHEERFULNESS TO BE FUNLESS IS TO BE LIFELESS GOOD CHEER IS THE TONIC OF YOUTH IF YOU ARE SO SAD YOU CANNOT LAUGH AT SOMETHING
SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE YOUTH IS ETERNAL NATURE NEVER GROWS OLD THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN EDEN ARE BLOOMING TO DAY JUST AS LOVELY JUST AS SWEET
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
PUT INVINCIBLE DETERMINATION I WILL INTO YOUR COMPLEX PROBLEM PUT IRRESISTIBLE CONFIDENCE I SHALL ACHIEVE INTO YOUR ARDENT DESIRES YOU WILL THEN LOVE WORK
FIND SOMEONE IN TROUBLE AND CHEER THEM ENCOURAGE THEM HELP THEM AND YOU WILL DELIVER YOURSELF YOU WILL COMFORT YOURSELF WHEN YOU COMFORT ANOTHER YOU CANNOT LOSE A LOVED ONE THO ABSENT FROM THE EARTH PLANE
FAILURE IS OFTEN THE TURNING POINT THE PIVOT OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SWINGS US TO HIGHER LEVELS IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IT MAY NOT BE FAME IT MAY BE NEW DRAUGHTS OF SPIRITUAL MORAL OR MENTAL INSPIRATION
THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY OF COURSE WITH THE AUTHOR'S ALREADY DISCUSSED VISUAL IMAGERY TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF IMAGINATION DOCTOR KROGER LIKE A FEW OTHERS HAS PROVED TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION THAT ALL HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA
AND ITS USE IN GUNPOWDER AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTILLATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THIS WAS THE SUCCESS OF FAILURE A WONDROUS PROCESS OF NATURE FOR THE HIGHEST GROWTH A MIGHTY LESSON OF COMFORT STRENGTH AND ENCOURAGEMENT
CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
WAS CONVINCED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A FORM OF HYSTERIA AND THAT ONLY HYSTERICS COULD BE HYPNOTIZED THE FORMER MESMER THOUGHT FURTHER THAT METAL BECAME IMBUED BY THE SOLAR QUALITIES AND HIS SYSTEM IS ALSO KNOWN AS METALOGY
WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
LET THINE HEART CHEER THEE GIVE IT OUT LET GO TO SLEEP WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND YOU WILL AWAKEN WITH A JOY IN YOUR HEART LET YOUR HUMOR BE RICH HUMOR LAUGHTER IS THE CIPHER KEY TO A MAN
GROW IN EACH DAY AND MAKE EACH DAY GROW CHECK DISCORD QUIT USELESS DISCUSSION FOR IT WEAKENS AND WITHERS STOP QUARRELING CHECK COMPLAININGS ROOT CRITICISM OUT OF YOUR LIFE
JUST AS FRESH AND UNCHANGED THE ROSES YOUR LIFE MATE BRINGS HOME TO YOU HAVE THE SAME FRAGRANCE AS THE ROSES ADAM BROUGHT TO EVE IF HE THOUGHT OF IT
IN DISCOVERING AMERICA COLUMBUS FAILED ABSOLUTELY HIS INGENIOUS REASONING AND EXPERIMENT LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT BY SAILING WESTWARD HE WOULD REACH INDIA EVERY REDMAN IN AMERICA CARRIES IN HIS NAME INDIAN
MAY THIS NOT BE ONE OF NATURE'S GENTLE SHOWINGS TO MAN OF THE TIMES WHEN HE GROWS BEST OF THE DARKNESS OF FAILURE THAT IS EVOLVING INTO THE SUNLIGHT OF SUCCESS LET US FEAR ONLY THE FAILURE OF NOT LIVING THE RIGHT AS WE SEE IT
DISTILLATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION THEY INVENTED THE ALEMBIC THE RETORT THE SAND BATH THE WATER BATH AND OTHER VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS TO THEM IS DUE THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY SULPHURIC ETHER AND PHOSPHORUS
AND WORK WITH CONFIDENT EXPECTATION PUT RULES AND SYSTEM INTO YOUR DAILY TASK EXERCISE YOUR SELF CONTROL YOUR SELF POSSESSION SELF MASTERY MARCH UP TO YOUR TASK WITH EFFICIENCY
THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
ANGANTYR VOWED THAT HE OWED NO TRIBUTE TO HELGE AND WOULD PAY HIM NONE BUT TO FRITHIOF HE GAVE A VAST TREASURE TELLING HIM THAT HE MIGHT DISPOSE OF IT AS HE WOULD SO FRITHIOF
THE BABY MONAD WILL GROW TO MATURITY IN AN HOUR PERSONALLY I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO LINGER IN MISSUS O'REILLY'S PLEASANT DRAWING ROOM FOR AS I SAID BEFORE MY VICTIM INTERESTED ME
WHICH SHE HAD JUST BEEN ANOINTING INTO THE FIRE IT WAS QUICKLY CONSUMED WHILE THE RISING FLAMES SET FIRE TO THE TEMPLE HORROR STRICKEN FRITHIOF TRIED TO STOP THE BLAZE AND WHEN HE COULD NOT
THE CONGREGATION ROSE LENA HOUGHTON STILL DOMINATED BY ME KNELT LONGER THAN THE REST BUT AT LAST SHE GOT UP AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE AND I FELT A GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
HE WAS VERY FAR FROM CONFINING HIMSELF TO ANY RULES OF HONOUR OR TO THE ESTABLISHED LAWS OF WAR FOR INSTEAD OF BOXING FAIRLY HE WOULD KICK PULL HAIR BITE
HIS FAVORITE DIVERSION WAS THAT WHICH HAS BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY THE VULGAR BY THE WELL KNOWN NAME OF PULLY HAWLY IN WHICH HE SO MUCH EXCELLED THAT WHENEVER HE WAS INVITED BY THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO PLAY WITH THEM
AND WENT RAIN OR SHINE TO SPEND TWO HOURS EACH SUNDAY IN A STUFFY SCHOOL ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE IT WAS STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO READY TO BELIEVE EVIL OF HER NEIGHBOUR
TO KEEP MY TONGUE FROM EVIL SPEAKING LYING AND SLANDERING WHAT IS MORE SHE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO TEACH THESE WORDS TO A BIG CLASS OF SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN
TOOK HER OFF VIA RUSSIA AND NIHILISM IN THE STATE PRAYERS AND BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED AT SAINT CHRYSOSTOM HAD BECOME SO POWERFUL THAT I HAD WORKED HER MIND INTO EXACTLY THE CONDITION I DESIRED
SAID THE CURATE WITH THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF RESENTMENT IN HIS TONE I KNEW THAT THE MORLEYS WERE HIS SPECIAL FRIENDS I IMAGINE THAT HE ADMIRES MISS MORLEY YES EVERY ONE THINKS THEY ARE EITHER ENGAGED OR ON THE BRINK OF IT
BUT MANY OF THE CREW WERE WORN OUT BY THE BATTLE WITH THE ELEMENTS AND HAD TO BE CARRIED ASHORE BY FRITHIOF AND BJOERN WHEN THEY REACHED THE ORKNEY ISLANDS
OF CLOWNISH MEMORY HIS FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN OF RANK AND FORTUNE AND GREATLY BELOVED AND RESPECTED BY ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCE
AND MUCH LONGER BEFORE HE COULD READ WITH TOLERABLE ACCURACY AND EVEN THEN HE PRONOUNCED EVERY THING WITH SUCH A CLOWNISH ACCENT AND SUCH A DRAWLING TONE
I SUPPOSE WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SOMETHING MAY PUT A STOP TO IT ALL WE MUST JUST LEAVE IT TO CHANCE THIS SENTIMENT AMUSED ME NOT A LITTLE LEAVE IT TO CHANCE INDEED
GRINNING AND LEERING THE WHOLE TIME
GREAT WAS HIS GRIEF WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HER TO SAIL AWAY NOT LONG HAD SHE BEEN GONE HOWEVER
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOMINATE HIS THOUGHTS AS I HAD DONE HERS FINDING ME BURDENSOME SHE HAD PASSED ME ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE WITH ADDITIONS THAT VASTLY INCREASED MY WORKING POWERS
AND THE MOMENT HE OPENED HIS MOUTH I KNEW THAT MY TIME HAD COME AND THAT THERE WAS A VERY FAIR CHANCE OF VICTORY BEFORE ME
IN MY FIRST STAGE THE READER WILL PERCEIVE THAT I WAS A COMPARATIVELY WEAK AND HARMLESS LITTLE SLANDER WITH MERELY THAT TAINT OF ORIGINAL SIN WHICH WAS TO BE EXPECTED IN ONE OF SUCH PARENTAGE
RICKARD ROSTICK SHE WAS SO MUCH OPPRESSED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION THAT SHE TORE THE LETTER INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND WAS READY TO BURST INTO TEARS
HIS CHIEF COMPANION THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW AFTER HER AND ASK FOR HER HAND HIS SHIP WAS PREPARED
A LITTLE NARROW A LITTLE PREJUDICED A LITTLE SPOILED BY THE DEVOTION OF THE DISTRICT VISITORS AND SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS BUT HE WAS HONEST AND ENERGETIC AND AS A WORKER AMONG THE POOR FEW COULD HAVE EQUALLED HIM
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IF YOUR BROTHER IS AT HOME I WANT JUST TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE CHOIR TREAT
FOR IT SEEMS SUCH A DREADFUL FATE FOR POOR GERTRUDE THE CURATE LOOKED STARTLED WHY I DON'T PROFESS TO LIKE MISTER ZALUSKI HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXACTLY AGAINST HIM BUT I DO
AND ALTHOUGH THEY FEARED SIGURD THEY WOULD NOT GRANT THE REQUEST INSTEAD HE WAS CONDEMNED IN PUNISHMENT TO SAIL AWAY TO THE ORKNEY ISLANDS TO CLAIM TRIBUTE FROM THE KING
MISSUS O'REILLY HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU HE ASKED WITH SOME CURIOSITY WHY SHE HAS FOUND OUT THAT HE IS REALLY A NIHILIST
AND AS THE LAD INCREASED IN BRAVERY AND STRENGTH THE GIRL INCREASED IN BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS OF SOUL HILDING NOTICING HOW EACH DAY THEY BECAME FONDER OF EACH OTHER
I HAVE SINCE OBSERVED THAT HE WAS ONLY A DEGREE WORSE THAN MANY OTHER CLERICAL READERS AND THAT A STRANGE AND DELIGHTFULLY MISTAKEN NOTION SEEMS PREVALENT THAT THE BIBLE MUST BE READ IN A DREARY AND UNNATURAL TONE OF VOICE
HE GENERALLY REWARDED THEIR CIVILITY BY TEARING THEIR COATS OR PULLING THEIR CLOTHES OFF THEIR BACKS BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME SO THAT AT LAST THEY BESTOWED UPON HIM BY GENERAL CONSENT THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF
WITH THESE HE COULD PULL AND HAWL AND ROMP AND TEAR AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND THE MORE ACTIVE HE BECAME IN THIS RAGGAMUFFIN SPECIES OF DIVERSION THE MORE THEY RELISHED HIS COMPANY
THE SINEWS OF MY NECK AND FOREARMS A MASS OF AGONIES AND NO MORE FIT TO SWIM ME TO THOSE REEDY SWAMPS WHICH NOW AS PAIN AND HUNGER BEGAN TO TELL SEEMED TO WEAR THE ASPECTS OF PARADISE WITH A GROAN I DROPPED BACK UPON MY RAFT AND WATCHED THE ISLANDS SLIPPING BY
THAT WHEN THESE DEPREDATIONS WERE FIRST MADE THEY TOOK THE FORM OF REPRISALS UPON THE SPANIARDS NO SOONER WAS GRANADA FALLEN THAN THOUSANDS OF DESPERATE MOORS LEFT THE LAND DISDAINING TO LIVE UNDER A SPANISH YOKE SETTLING ALONG A PORTION OF THE NORTHERN COAST OF AFRICA
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I GO ABOUT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT WITH TURKEY CARPETS UNDER MY ARM DO YOU IT BELONGS TO THIS OLD CHAP HERE WHO HAS JUST DROPPED OUT OF THE SKIES ON TO HIS HEAD CHUCK IT ON TOP AND SHUT THE DOOR AND THAT RUG THE VERY MAINSPRING OF THE STARTLING THINGS WHICH FOLLOWED
A HEAD PRESENTLY DEVELOPED THEN AS WE APPROACHED THE EARS AND ANTLERS OF A SWIMMING STAG IT WAS A HUGE BEAST AS IT LOOMED UP AGAINST THE GLOW BIGGER THAN ANY MORTAL STAG EVER WAS THE KIND OF FELLOW TRAVELLER NO ONE WOULD WILLINGLY ACCOST
ANYTHING WERE BETTER THAN THIS ANY ENTERPRISE HOWEVER WILD ANY ADVENTURE HOWEVER DESPERATE OH I WISH I WERE ANYWHERE BUT HERE ANYWHERE OUT OF THIS REDTAPE RIDDEN WORLD OF OURS I WISH I WERE IN THE PLANET MARS
SO WITH A DISDAINFUL GLANCE I TURNED ON MY HEELS AND SET OFF ALONE AS HARD AS I COULD GO FOR THE HARBOUR BUT IT WAS TOO LATE I RUSHED THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE WHERE ALL WAS SILENT AND DESERTED I RAN ON TO THE WHARVES BEYOND AND THEY WERE EMPTY SAVE FOR THE LITTER AND EMBERS OF THE FIRES AR HAP'S MEN HAD MADE DURING THEIR STAY
THINK HOW FINE IT WILL LOOK TO BRING HER BACK BEFORE YON SLEEPY FELLOWS HAVE FOUND THEIR WEAPONS YOU THERE WITH THE BLUE TUNIC YOU LOOK A PROPER FELLOW AND SOMETHING OF A HEART SHOULD BEAT UNDER SUCH GAY WRAPPINGS WILL YOU COME WITH ME BUT BLUE MANTLE BITING HIS THUMBS
THEY IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO FIRST ATTACK ALL SPANISH VESSELS THAT COULD BE FOUND THEIR QUICKNESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE COASTS GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF REPRISALS FOR WHICH THEY LONGED PROBABLY THIS GOT MONOTONOUS IN COURSE OF TIME
LITTLE DID I GUESS HOW DEAR IT WOULD BE AT ANY PRICE MEANWHILE THAT STEAK WAS LATE
WHEN A BOAT FULL OF PIRATES SUDDENLY CAME ALONGSIDE AND SPEEDILY UPSET THE QUIETNESS WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY REIGNED ON BOARD THE JACOB FIVE OF THE CREW MANAGED TO ESCAPE IN THE CUTTER'S BOAT AND WERE PICKED UP SOME DAYS LATER BY A PASSING VESSEL
OR CROSSED THE MOUTHS OF DIM ALLEYS LEADING HEAVEN KNOWS TO WHAT INFERNAL DENS OF MYSTERY AND CRIME EVEN IN THIS LATTER DAY CITY OF OURS THE MOON WAS UP AS FAR AS THE CHURCH STEEPLES LARGE VAPOURY CLOUDS SCUDDING ACROSS THE SKY BETWEEN US AND HER
AND A FEW OTHER FRENCHMEN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THE PIRATES SEEMED VERY MUCH DISINCLINED TO PART WITH THESE PRISONERS ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE FRENCH BARQUE TOOK PLACE A NOTICE WAS ISSUED BY THE BRITISH BOARD OF TRADE IN WHICH THE ATTENTION OF SHIP OWNERS AND MASTERS OF VESSELS
FOR WHEN I WOKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING MY SURROUNDINGS WERE FAMILIAR ENOUGH THOUGH A GLORIOUS MAZE OF UNCERTAINTIES ROCKED TO AND FRO IN MY MIND
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER ANOTHER BOAT CONTAINING ABOUT TWENTY PIRATES CAME OFF AND FIRED ON THE SHIP THE CREW SEEING THAT THEY COULD OFFER NO EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE HID THEMSELVES AWAY IN THE HOLD THE OTHER PIRATES HAD LEFT VERY LITTLE FOR THE NEW ARRIVALS TO TAKE
PICKED MY WAY HOMEWARD BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE DISMALNESS OF A NEW YORK SLUM I LONGED FOR STEAK AND STOUT SLIPPERS AND A PIPE WITH ALL THE PATHETIC KEENNESS OF A TROUBLED SOUL IT WAS A WILD BLACK KIND OF NIGHT AND THE WEIRDNESS OF IT SHOWED UP AS I PASSED FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
AN ARRANGEMENT WAS AFTERWARDS MADE WITH THE PIRATES TO RELEASE THE CAPTAINS OF THE FIDUCIA AND THE PORTUGUESE BARQUE ROSITA FARO A MUCH EARLIER CAPTURE AND SOME MEMBERS OF BOTH CREWS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIFFIANS CAPTURED BY THE SPANISH STEAMER SEVILLA AND A RANSOM OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND THIS SEEMED TO ANNOY THEM SO MUCH THAT THEY GAVE VENT TO THEIR ILL FEELINGS IN SEVERAL WAYS NOT THE LEAST WANTON BEING THE POLLUTION OF THE SHIP'S FRESH WATER THEY ALSO SMASHED THE VESSEL'S COMPASS AND TORE UP THE CHARTS
GET ME A HORSE AND JUST A HANDFUL OF YOUR SLEEK KINDRED AND WE WILL PULL THE PRIZE FROM THE BEAR'S PAW EVEN YET SURELY I SAID TURNING TO A KNOT OF MARTIAN YOUTHS WHO STOOD LISTENING A FEW STEPS AWAY
BUT AS THE FRESHENING EVENING WIND BLEW ON MY FACE AND THE DARKENING WATER LAPPED AGAINST MY FOREHEAD I REVIVED MORE FULLY WHERE HAD WE COME TO I TURNED AN ACHING NECK AND ALL ALONG ON BOTH SIDES SEEMED TO STRETCH STEEP STRAIGHT COASTS ABOUT A MILE OR SO APART
FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING THE RELEASE OF CAPTIVES TO BE RECEIVED WITH DERISION OFTEN TOO THEY WERE MALTREATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WERE GLAD TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR LIVES SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES CONTINUALLY ENDEAVORED TO PURCHASE CAPTIVES FOR THE PLEASURE OF KILLING THEM
WHEN HOWEVER THE LATTER GOT WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO OF THE HELPLESS VESSEL THE SUSPICIONS OF THE CREW WERE AROUSED
A PERFECT JUNGLE OF AN ALPHABET THROUGH WHICH NONE BUT A WIZARD COULD HAVE FORCED A WAY IN SEARCH OF MEANING ALTOGETHER I THOUGHT AS I KICKED IT OUT STRAIGHT UPON MY FLOOR IT WAS A STRANGE AND NOT UNHANDSOME ARTICLE OF FURNITURE IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR THE MESS ROOM ON THE CAROLINA
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEMSELVES ATTACKED A VESSEL SOME LITTLE TIME AGO BELONGING TO THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO FOR YEARS PAST THE GOVERNMENTS OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN POWERS HAVE SOUGHT TO PUT FRIENDLY PRESSURE UPON THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO
TWO BOATLOADS OF THEM TWENTY YARDS FROM SHORE
BUT HE WHO RIDES HELPLESS DOWN AN EVENING TIDE STANDS OUT FOR NO GREAT NICETIES OF LANDING PLACE COULD I BUT REACH THEM THEY WOULD MAKE AT LEAST A DRIER BED THAN THIS OF MINE
A POOR YOUNGER SON WITH FIVE DOLLARS IN MY PURSE BY WAY OF FORTUNE A PACKET OF UNPAID BILLS IN MY BREASTPOCKET AND ROUND MY NECK A LOCKET WITH A PORTRAIT THEREIN OF THAT DEAR BUXOM FRECKLED STUB NOSED GIRL AWAY IN A LITTLE SOUTHERN SEAPORT TOWN
BUT AT MY WORD A QUIVER OF EXPECTATION RAN THROUGH THAT GAUNT WEB A RUSTLE OF ANTICIPATION FILLED ITS ANCIENT FABRIC AND ONE FRAYED CORNER SURGED UP AND AS I PASSED OFF ITS SURFACE IN MY STRIDE
MUCH TO THEIR AMAZEMENT FOR IT SO HAPPENED THAT NONE OF THE PIRATES HAD STAYED ON BOARD NO DOUBT THEY WERE EAGER TO FIND A SAFE HIDING PLACE FOR THEIR PLUNDER
I WISH I WISH I EXCLAIMED WALKING ROUND THE LITTLE ROOM I WISH I WERE WHILE THESE UNFINISHED EXCLAMATIONS WERE ACTUALLY PASSING MY LIPS I CHANCED TO CROSS THAT INFERNAL MAT AND IT IS NO MORE STARTLING THAN TRUE
A STRANGE MEDLEY OF SOUNDS IN MY EARS AND THEN CLUTCHING AT A PILE OF STUFFS AS I FELL A TALL BOWER OF SPRAY RISING ON EITHER HAND AND THE COOL SHOCK OF THE BLUE SEA AS I PLUNGED HEADLONG IN BUT NOTHING AFTER THAT HOW LONG AFTER I KNOW NOT
AND INSENSIBLE TO THE SILENT AGONY OF SYBIL WHO SOUGHT IN VAIN TO CATCH HIS EYE HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT OF REVENGE AND THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS PURPOSES ALL WITHIN WAS A WILD AND FEARFUL TURMOIL
MEMOIR WILLIAM HARRISON AINSWORTH WAS BORN IN KING STREET MANCHESTER FEBRUARY FOURTH EIGHTEEN O FIVE IN A HOUSE THAT HAS LONG SINCE BEEN DEMOLISHED
JACK SHEPPARD APPEARED IN BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY OF WHICH AINSWORTH BECAME EDITOR IN MARCH EIGHTEEN FORTY
HIS LIFE HE TO HIS DOCTRINE BROUGHT
BUT AT THE TIME OF WHICH WE WRITE THIS FAIR GARDEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART A WASTE ILL KEPT AND UNREGARDED
WHICH SINCE THE DAYS OF THE INNOVATORS KENT AND HIS BOLD ASSOCIATES CAPABILITY BROWN AND CO HAS OBTAINED SO LARGELY THIS WAS A GARDEN
THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT SO OBSERVABLE IN THE EASTERN WING WHICH OVERLOOKED THE GARDEN HERE MIGHT BE DISCERNED MANY INDICATIONS OF ITS ANTIQUITY THE STRENGTH AND SOLIDITY OF THE WALLS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN AS ELSEWHERE
TO TAKE TOO MUCH UPON MYSELF WITH OTHERS THE OLD GIPSY PAUSED HERE AND THEN ASSUMING A MORE FAMILIAR TONE EXCLAIMED THE ESTATES OF ROOKWOOD ARE AMPLE WOMAN WHAT MEAN YOU
YOU MAY PERCHANCE RECALL THE BLACK GIPSY WOMAN WHO WHEN YOU WERE SURROUNDED WITH GAY GALLANTS WITH DANCING PLUMES PERUSED YOUR PALM AND WHISPERED IN YOUR EAR THE FAVORED SUITOR'S NAME BIDE WITH ME A MOMENT MADAM SAID BARBARA
YOU ARE WITHIN SACRED WALLS I WILL TAKE YOU WHERE AN ALTAR STANDS
WHICH IS A FINE PIECE OF HISTORICAL ROMANCE THE CRITICS WHO HAD OBJECTED TO THE ROMANTIC GLAMOR CAST OVER THE CAREER OF DICK TURPIN WERE STILL FURTHER HORRIFIED AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT VULGAR RASCAL JACK SHEPPARD
CONSTABLE OF THE TOWER EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO CARDINAL POLE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE JOHN LAW THE PROJECTOR EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR
BEWARE ADDED HE IN A DEEP TONE I AM THY FRIEND BARBARA'S WITHERED COUNTENANCE EXHIBITED FOR AN INSTANT THE DEEPEST INDIGNATION AT THE SEXTON'S THREAT THE MALEDICTION TREMBLED ON HER TONGUE
AND GREENEST OF LAWNS WITH ITS ADMONITORY SUN DIAL ITS MARBLE BASIN IN THE CENTRE ITS FOUNTAIN AND CONCHED WATER GOD THE QUAINT SUMMER HOUSE SURMOUNTED WITH ITS GILT VANE THE STATUE GLIMMERING FROM OUT ITS COVERT OF LEAVES
AND KINDLE THE FIRE WITHIN HER EYES
THAT IN THEIR HOUSEKEEPING MAY COMPARE WITH A LORD OR BARON IN SOME COUNTRIES BEYOND THE SEAS YEA ALTHOUGH I NAMED A HIGHER DEGREE I WERE ABLE TO JUSTIFY IT WE HAVE NO SUCH
APPEARED THE HOARY SUMMIT OF A DOVECOT INDICATING THE NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD OF AN ANCIENT BARN CONTEMPORARY WITH THE EARLIEST DWELLING HOUSE AND OF A LITTLE WORLD OF OFFICES AND OUTBUILDINGS BURIED IN THE THICKNESS OF THE FOLIAGE TO THE RIGHT WAS THE GARDEN
I COULD NOT RESIST IT THE TEMPTER WAS AT HAND HE IS SELDOM ABSENT ON OCCASIONS LIKE THE PRESENT THE SEXTON STOOD BESIDE HIS GRANDSON LUKE STARTED
WHICH HAD GIVEN ITS NAME TO THE FAMILY THAT DWELT AMONGST ITS ROOK HAUNTED SHADES DESCENDING THE AVENUE
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOURS LADY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT FOR THAT MARRIAGE YOU WOULD HAVE BESEEMED THEM BRAVELY SIR REGINALD WAS WILFUL AND ERASED THE DAUGHTER'S NAME TO SUBSTITUTE THAT OF HIS SON
YOUR COMPANION FATHER AMBROSE AS YOU CALL HIM WILL DO THE OFFICE FITTINGLY HE HAS ESSAYED HIS CLERKLY SKILL ALREADY ON OTHERS OF YOUR HOUSE TO WHAT DO YOU ALLUDE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
PRESENTING A RICH PICTURESQUE OUTLINE WITH ITS INNUMERABLE GABLE ENDS ITS FANTASTICAL COIGNS AND TALL CREST OF TWISTED CHIMNEYS THERE WAS NO UNIFORMITY OF STYLE ABOUT THE BUILDING YET THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS PLEASING AND BEAUTIFUL
COMMUNICATING WITH SUITES OF CHAMBERS FOR THE MOST PART DESERTED EXCEPTING ONE OR TWO WHICH WERE USED AS DORMITORIES AND ANOTHER LITTLE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH AN ORIEL WINDOW OPENING UPON THE LAWN
BUT SHARED HIS INTELLECTUAL TASTE AND LITERARY ENTHUSIASM A DRAMA WRITTEN FOR PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE WAS PRINTED IN ARLISS'S MAGAZINE AND HE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE MANCHESTER IRIS THE EDINBURGH MAGAZINE
REPLIED MISSUS MOWBRAY HASTILY TWERE INDEED TO WED YOUR CHILD TO BEGGARY SAID BARBARA MISSUS MOWBRAY SIGHED DEEPLY THERE IS A WAY CONTINUED THE OLD CRONE IN A DEEP WHISPER
AND IN ONE OF HIS EARLY NOVELS HAS LEFT AN INTERESTING AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF ITS THEN CONDITION WHICH MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH THAT OF AN EARLIER PERIOD LEFT BY THE ENGLISH OPIUM EATER AT SIXTEEN A BRILLIANT HANDSOME YOUTH
I AM RIGHT AGAINST MY HOUSE SEAT OF MY ANCESTORS YORKSHIRE TRAGEDY ROOKWOOD PLACE WAS A FINE OLD IRREGULAR PILE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
AND WHAT BECAME OF HIS FAIR WIFE HIS BROTHER'S MINION TWAS A FOUL DEED I GRANT AND YET THERE WAS EXPIATION BLOOD FLOWED BLOOD SILENCE THOU NIGHT HAG THUNDERED PETER
HE BEGAN BUSINESS AS A PUBLISHER BUT AFTER AN EXPERIENCE OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS HE ABANDONED IT IN THIS BRIEF INTERVAL HE INTRODUCED THE HON MISSUS NORTON AND UDE THE COOK TO THE DISCERNING THOUGH UNEQUAL ADMIRATION OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC
IN THE ERECTION AND ENDOWMENT OF THE NEIGHBORING CHURCH IT WAS OF MIXED ARCHITECTURE AND COMBINED THE PECULIARITIES OF EACH SUCCESSIVE ERA RETAINING SOME OF THE STERNER FEATURES OF EARLIER DAYS
THEY SAW THIS AND WERE FRIGHTENED THEY SAT THERE FOR A LONG TIME SAYING NOTHING THEN THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE AND ASKED WHY IS THIS WHY DO YOU NOT GIVE ME FOOD
CROOKED AT ONE END WOUND WITH FUR AND TIED HERE AND THERE WITH EAGLE FEATHERS AT THE END WAS A KIT FOX SKIN AGAIN THE CHIEF SPOKE AND SAID LISTEN TO OUR SONG DO NOT FORGET IT AND THE DANCE TOO YOU MUST REMEMBER
I WOULD REGRET TO LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT POSSESSING SOME OF IT BUT NO ONE HAS DARED TO BRAVE THE TWO DRAGONS THAT GUARD THE CAVERN WHERE THE FOUNTAIN IS TO BE FOUND YOU DO NOT NEED THE WATER PRINCESS BUT MY LIFE IS YOURS TO COMMAND
THESE WERE DECLINED SO BOWING LOW HE RELUCTANTLY TOOK LEAVE OF THE PRINCESS HE BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD BUT USED THIS MEANS TO PUT HIM OFF AND HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WAS SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP
AND SOME DAY I WILL REPAY YOU AFTER THAT IT FLEW SWIFTLY AWAY CHARMING AT LAST REACHED THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS AND ASKED AN AUDIENCE HIS NAME SO PLEASED HER THAT SHE AT ONCE RECEIVED HIM
IN THE MORNING HE AND FRISK WERE WALKING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHEN THE DOG RAN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BARKING FURIOUSLY JOINING THE LITTLE ANIMAL HE SAW THAT HIS EXCITEMENT WAS CAUSED BY A GOLDEN CARP
CHARMING CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE GIANT AND CARRIED IT BACK WITH HIM TO THE PRINCESS THEN THE PEOPLE SHOUTED UNTIL THEY WERE HOARSE AND WELCOMED HIM AS A GREAT HERO YOUR ENEMY IS DEAD
YOU HAVE ARGUED SO ELOQUENTLY REPLIED SHE THAT I REGRET TO DENY YOU BUT I HAVE MADE A VOW NOT TO MARRY UNTIL THE AMBASSADOR CAN RETURN TO ME A RING WHICH I LOST IN THE RIVER A MONTH AGO
THEN THERE ROSE A TERRIBLE SOUND ALL THE ANIMALS HOWLED AND GROWLED AND RUSHED TOWARD HIM BUT THE CHIEF WOLF GOT TO HIM FIRST AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND SAID WAIT HE IS YOUNG
IN THIS WAY WE SHALL HAVE FOOD TO EAT AND SHALL LIVE
THERE IS FOOD SAID HE AS HE PUT IT DOWN BY THE WOMAN NOW TO MORROW MOVE YOUR CAMP OVER TO OUR LODGES DO NOT FEAR ANYTHING NO MATTER WHAT STRANGE THINGS YOU MAY SEE DO NOT FEAR ALL WILL BE YOUR FRIENDS YET ABOUT ONE THING I MUST WARN YOU
THAT HE MADE EVERY PREPARATION TO RECEIVE HER THE AMBASSADOR ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS WITH A HUNDRED HORSES AND AS MANY SERVANTS WITH GREAT CEREMONY HE PRESENTED THE KING'S GIFTS OF PEARLS AND DIAMONDS TOGETHER WITH HIS MESSAGE
ONE DAY THE KING HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THE TOWER AND HEARD HIM EXCLAIM I AM THE KING'S MOST FAITHFUL SUBJECT HOW HAVE I INCURRED HIS DISPLEASURE THEN IN SPITE OF THE PROTESTS OF CHARMING'S ENEMIES
THEN THE CHIEF SANG AND DANCED AND AFTERWARD HE GAVE THE WOLF CHIEF'S FRIEND THE MEDICINE IT WAS A LONG KNIFE AND MANY SCALPS WERE TIED ON THE HANDLE THIS SAID HE IS FOR THE ALL FRIENDS
YOU SHALL BE MY HUSBAND SAID SHE AND I WILL MAKE YOU KING CHARMING FELL AT HER FEET AND EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE AND JOY
AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW AN OWL FLYING TOWARD HIM I CAN ENTER THE GLOOMY CAVERN WITHOUT DANGER THE OWL SAID GIVE THE FLASK TO ME AND I WILL REPAY THE DEBT I OWE YOU FOR HAVING SAVED ME FROM THE NET
AND TOOK THEIR LOADS ON THEIR BACKS AND SET OUT IT WAS STILL WINTER AND THEY TRAVELLED SLOWLY BESIDES THEY WERE WEAK FROM HUNGER AND COULD GO ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE IN A DAY THE FOURTH NIGHT CAME AND THEY SAT IN THEIR LODGE
CHARMING REPLIED THAT HE MUST HAVE CONSIDERED HIS DUTY TO HIS KING EVEN BEFORE A HAPPINESS SO GREAT THE KING WITH PRESENTS OF RICH JEWELS AND A SPLENDID ESCORT MET THEM ON THE WAY TO THE PALACE
WHEN YOU REACH HOME TEACH THEM TO THE PEOPLE HE SANG AND DANCED THEN PRESENTLY HIS GUESTS DEPARTED AGAIN THEY HEARD THE FEAST SHOUT AND HE WHO CALLED WAS THE CHIEF OF THE BEAR SOCIETY
IF YOU SHOULD FIND AN ARROW LYING ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE PISKUN OR OUTSIDE DO NOT TOUCH IT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR WIVES NOR YOUR CHILDREN WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE WENT OUT
THIS IS OUR SONG AND OUR DANCE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SINGING AND DANCING HE PLACED THE STICK IN THE SACK AND GAVE IT TO THE MAN AND SAID TAKE IT WITH YOU
NOT DARING TO CONFESS SHE PUT ANOTHER IN ITS PLACE THAT EXACTLY RESEMBLED IT IN APPEARANCE THIS HOWEVER CONTAINED A DEADLY POISON WHEN THE KING BATHED HIS FACE WITH IT HE FELL INTO A SLEEP FROM WHICH HE NEVER AWOKE
THE PRINCESS HOWEVER DID NOT FAVOR THE KING'S SUIT AND SENT BACK HIS GIFTS WITH A POLITE REFUSAL WHEN THE AMBASSADOR RETURNED WITHOUT THE PRINCESS EVERY ONE BLAMED HIM FOR HIS FAILURE AND THE KING'S DISAPPOINTMENT WAS SO GREAT
THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT POMP AND CHARMING STOOD FIRST IN THE KING'S FAVOR HIS GOOD FORTUNE HOWEVER DID NOT CONTINUE LONG FOR ENVIOUS ENEMIES POINTED OUT TO THE KING THAT THE PRINCESS WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS CHARMING WAS NEAR
THERE WAS GREAT CONFUSION IN THE PALACE WHEN THE KING WAS FOUND DEAD FRISK RAN IMMEDIATELY TO CHARMING AND TOLD HIM THE NEWS IN A SHORT TIME GOLDILOCKS ALSO APPEARED UNLOCKED HIS CHAINS AND SET HIM FREE
BE NOT SO BOASTFUL GALIFRON
WE HAVE NO FOOD FOR MANY DAYS THE BUFFALO DID NOT COME IN SIGHT AND WE LOOKED FOR DEER AND OTHER ANIMALS WHICH PEOPLE EAT AND WHEN THESE HAD ALL BEEN KILLED WE BEGAN TO STARVE THEN I SAID
WE WILL NOT STAY HERE TO DIE FROM HUNGER AND WE SET OUT FOR THE MOUNTAINS THIS IS THE FOURTH NIGHT OF OUR TRAVELS
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
HE WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD SITTING THERE ALONGSIDE OF YOU WASN'T HE I DON'T WONDER HE WAS I REMEMBER BUT I DON'T SEE THAT THAT WAS A REASON FOR COLD SHOULDERING ME
EVER ANYTHING ABOUT YOU AND ME
HE GREW SERIOUS AGAIN AND MOVED NEARER TO HER
RAKE UP THAT'S THE IDEA IS IT
SHE THREW A STARTLED LOOK AT HIM AND HE ADDED REASSURINGLY OH DON'T MISTAKE ME
TO A STIFF LIKE MILLARD BINCH AND THAT WAS ABOUT ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE I CAME ALONG UNDINE FLUSHED TO THE FOREHEAD OH ELMER I WAS ONLY A CHILD
THE GIRL HESITATED I NEVER FELT TOWARD YOU THE WAY FATHER DID SHE HAZARDED AT LENGTH AND HE GAVE HER ANOTHER LONG LOOK IN RETURN
BELIED BY PREMATURELY ASTUTE BLACK EYES HAD A LOOK OF JOVIAL CUNNING WHICH UNDINE HAD FORMERLY THOUGHT SMART BUT WHICH NOW STRUCK HER AS MERELY VULGAR SHE FELT THAT IN THE MARVELL SET
AND THE GIRL MOVED ON BESIDE HIM WITH HER LONG FLOWING STEPS WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE COMPARATIVE SHELTER OF THE INTERLACING TREES MOFFATT PAUSED AGAIN TO SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK
NOT SO MUCH BY THE UNLIKELY CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER WITH RALPH MARVELL AS BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF SIMILAR MEETINGS FAR FROM ACCIDENTAL WITH THE ROMANTIC AARONSON
SHE HAD PUT ON HER PLAINEST DRESS AND WOUND A CLOSELY PATTERNED VEIL OVER HER LEAST VIVID HAT BUT EVEN THUS TONED DOWN TO THE SITUATION SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BLAZING OUT FROM IT INCONVENIENTLY
TAKING HER LIFELESS FINGERS INTO HIS DAPPERLY GLOVED HAND THROUGH HER VEIL SHE FORMED THE WORDS I SAID I'D COME HE LAUGHED THAT'S SO AND YOU SEE I BELIEVED YOU
SHE BROKE OUT SOBBING NONSENSE CHILD OF COURSE YOU SHAN'T HERE LOOK UP UNDINE WHY I NEVER SAW YOU CRY BEFORE DON'T YOU BE AFRAID OF ME
TO PASS THE SPONGE OVER ELMER MOFFATT OF APEX CITY CUT THE GENTLEMAN WHEN WE MEET THAT THE SIZE OF IT
MENTION THE FACT TO ABNER E SPRAGG NEXT TIME YOU RUN ACROSS HIM FATHER'LL BE REAL GLAD TOO ELMER SHE HESITATED AND THEN WENT ON YOU MUST SEE NOW
AND ESCAPE ALL THESE RIDICULOUS PREPARATIONS I SHALL HATE YOUR FINE CLOTHES IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU SO MISERABLE SHE DROPPED HER HANDS AND SWEPT ABOUT ON HIM HER FACE LIT UP BY A NEW IDEA
AS DISTASTEFUL BUT MORE REMOTE IT WAS REVIVED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A RUDDY MIDDLE SIZED YOUNG MAN HIS STOUTISH FIGURE TIGHTLY BUTTONED INTO A SQUARE SHOULDERED OVER COAT
INTO A FISSURE OF THE ASPHALT AT LENGTH HE WENT ON IN A TONE THAT SHOWED A FIRST FAINT TRACE OF IRRITATION
SHE WAS FOLLOWING HER OWN TRAIN OF THOUGHT WITH A LOOK OF PALE INTENSITY YOU'RE LIVING IN NEW YORK THEN YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE HERE RIGHT ALONG WELL IT LOOKS THAT WAY
THOUGH HER ENTREATING HANDS HER GLOWING FACE WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO HAVE SHAKEN LESS STURDY NERVES
I'LL BE OFF SHE WAS REMOVING HER LONG GLOVES AND HE TOOK HER HANDS AND DREW HER CLOSE
WHAT SHE WANTED WAS SOLITUDE AND THE TIME TO PUT SOME ORDER INTO HER THOUGHTS AND SHE HOPED TO STEAL INTO HER ROOM WITHOUT MEETING HER MOTHER THROUGH HER THICK VEIL
TRYING TO HIDE HER VEXATION IN A SMILE
SHE INTERRUPTED NERVOUSLY THAT'S SO TOO SUPPOSE WE WALK ALONG A LITTLE WAYS IT'S RATHER CHILLY STANDING ROUND HE TURNED DOWN THE PATH THAT DESCENDED TOWARD THE RAMBLE
I WASN'T A PROMISING CASE IN THOSE DAYS HIS GLANCE PLAYED OVER HER FOR A MOMENT SAY UNDINE IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED THOUGH WASN'T IT
WHAT YOU ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT ANYHOW SHE CAST A HELPLESS GLANCE DOWN THE WINDINGS OF THE WOODED GLEN IN WHICH THEY HAD HALTED JUST TO ASK YOU
DEAREST DON'T IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT THE THOUGHT'S TOO GLORIOUS UNDINE LINGERED IN HIS ARMS NOT WITH ANY INTENT OF TENDERNESS BUT AS IF TOO DEEPLY LOST IN A NEW TRAIN OF THOUGHT
I CAN'T SEE WHAT'S THE USE NOW
WAS THEIR MAKING YOU FEEL SO TOO
WHEN UNDINE REGAINED ITS MONUMENTAL THRESHOLD SHE SLIPPED THROUGH THE MARBLE VESTIBULE AND SOARED SKYWARD IN THE MIRROR LINED LIFT HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE DIRECTION SHE WAS TAKING
I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU SO DONE UP
AND IT WAS JUST THE TIME THE DEAL WENT THROUGH SO
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU UNDINE AND AFTER A FIRST MOMENT OF RELUCTANCE SHE SUBMISSIVELY THREW BACK HER VEIL HE LET HIS EYES REST ON HER IN SILENCE THEN HE SAID JUDICIALLY
SHE DREW BACK WITH A NERVOUS GESTURE
FUNNY TO THINK OF AIN'T IT UNDINE RECOVERING HERSELF HELD OUT HER HAND IMPULSIVELY I'M REAL GLAD OF IT I MEAN I'M REAL GLAD
AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THE CHANGE IMPLIED AS HE DREW NEARER THE YOUNG MAN'S AIR OF ASSURANCE WAS REPLACED BY AN EXPRESSION OF MILDLY HUMOROUS SURPRISE WELL THIS IS WHITE OF YOU UNDINE HE SAID
WHEN I WAS ENGAGED TO MILLARD THAT'S A FACT
TO DYE A BUFF COLOR BOIL EQUAL PARTS OF ARNOTTO AND COMMON POTASH IN SOFT CLEAR WATER WHEN DISSOLVED TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE WHEN COOL PUT IN THE GOODS WHICH SHOULD PREVIOUSLY BE WASHED FREE FROM SPOTS AND COLOR
WHERE THEY JOINED MESSRS TUCKER JOHNSON RICHEY AND OTHERS WHO BEING ANXIOUS TO ASSIST IN THE GOOD WORK HAD KILLED AND WERE FIRE DRYING BEEF TO TAKE UP THE MOUNTAINS HERE TWO DAYS WERE SPENT MAKING PACK SADDLES DRIVING IN HORSES
THE FIRST RELIEF DECIDED TO PRESERVE ITS SUPPLIES FOR THE RETURN TRIP BY HANGING THEM IN PARCELS FROM ROPES
THE TEN KEPT TOGETHER COURAGEOUSLY
AND WENT STRAIGHT AT THE BEAST IT FLED BACK AND THE PRINCE RAN AFTER IT BUT HE SOON SAW THAT HE COULDN'T CATCH IT ON FOOT SO HE HASTENED TO THE STABLE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE BEST HORSE THERE AND SET OFF IN PURSUIT
THEN ONLY WILL YOU OVERCOME ME WHEN YOU ENTER HERE THE PRINCE WENT HOME TOLD HIS FATHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND ASKED HIM TO HAVE A LEATHER ROPE PLAITED LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE OTHER WORLD HIS FATHER ORDERED THIS TO BE DONE
TO TRANSPORT THE EXPEDITION TO FEATHER RIVER AND MISTER JOHN FULLER VOLUNTEERED TO PILOT THE LAUNCH IT WAS DECIDED TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION
COLD SOAP HEAT TWENTY SIX POUNDS OF STRAINED GREASE WHEN MELTED MIX IT WITH FOUR PAILSFUL OF LYE MADE OF TWENTY POUNDS OF WHITE POTASH LET THE WHOLE STAND IN THE SUN STIRRING IT FREQUENTLY IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK
THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO CAMP EARLY BY HEAVY RAINS WHICH DRENCHED CLOTHING BLANKETS AND EVEN THE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY STORED UNDER THE SADDLES AND LEATHER SADDLE COVERS THIS CAUSED A DELAY OF THIRTY SIX HOURS
OUR TWO PRINCES FOR THE THIRD ONE HAS DISAPPEARED HAVE BROUGHT AWAY BRIDES FROM THE OTHER WORLD AND WANT TO MARRY THEM BUT THOSE BRIDES REFUSE FOR THEY INSIST ON HAVING ALL THEIR WEDDING CLOTHES MADE FOR THEM FIRST
THE CREWS OF THE SAVANNAH AND THE SLOOP WARREN AND THE MARINES IN GARRISON AT SAN FRANCISCO INCREASED THE RELIEF FUND TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS MESSRS MELLUS AND HOWARD TENDERED THEIR LAUNCH TO CARRY THE PARTY UP THE BAY
INASMUCH AS THROUGH HIM THEY WERE ENRICHED BY THE KING BY THE TIME THE PRINCELY WORKMAN HAD GONE THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS THE PRINCESSES HAD RECEIVED WHAT THEY HAD ASKED FOR ALL THEIR CLOTHES WERE JUST LIKE WHAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE OTHER WORLD
AND THEN THE PRINCE TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND WENT ON TO THE SECOND SISTER THE ONE WHO LIVED IN THE SILVER PALACE AND WITH HER ALSO HE STAYED AWHILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT HER BROTHER NORKA WAS THEN AT HER YOUNGEST SISTER'S
WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THEM OUT INTO THE UPPER WORLD FOR THEY ALL LOVED HIM AND WOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM HIM EACH OF THEM TURNED HER PALACE INTO AN EGG FOR THEY WERE ALL ENCHANTRESSES AND THEY TAUGHT HIM HOW TO TURN THE EGGS INTO PALACES AND BACK AGAIN
WHEN THE ROPE WAS MADE THE PRINCE CALLED FOR HIS BROTHERS AND HE AND THEY HAVING TAKEN SERVANTS WITH THEM AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED FOR A WHOLE YEAR SET OUT FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE BEAST HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE STONE
TO KEEP THE VITRIOL FROM INJURING THE TEXTURE OF THE CLOTH IF YOU WISH FOR A LIVELY BRIGHT GREEN MIX A LITTLE OF THE ABOVE COMPOSITION WITH YELLOW DYE
AND LET THE WATER BOIL FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THEN PUT IN SUFFICIENT COLD WATER TO MAKE IT LUKEWARM PUT IN THE GOODS AND BOIL THEM AN HOUR AND A QUARTER TAKE THEM OUT WITHOUT WRINGING AND DRY THEM IN A SHADY PLACE THE BLOSSOMS OF THE BALM OF GILEAD
WHO HAD ALREADY TWICE SENT SUPPLIES FIRST BY STANTON AND AGAIN BY MC CUTCHEN AND REED IN THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE MOUNTAINS
WITH HIS MEN AND SUPPLIES INCLUDING CLOTHING FOR THE DESTITUTE SHOULD GO BY BOAT TO SUTTER'S LANDING THERE PROCURE PACK ANIMALS BUY BEEF CATTLE AND HURRY ON TO THE SNOW BELT ESTABLISH A RELAY CAMP SLAUGHTER THE CATTLE
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY BUILT A PALACE ON THE SPOT AND LIVED IN IT FOR SOME TIME BUT WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY THE YOUNGEST BROTHER SAID TO THE OTHERS NOW BROTHERS WHO IS GOING TO LIFT THIS STONE NEITHER OF THEM COULD SO MUCH AS STIR IT
HAVING HANDED OVER THE CLOTHES WENT HOME BUT HE NO LONGER FOUND HIS DEAR JOURNEYMAN THERE FOR THE PRINCE HAD GONE TO A SHOEMAKER'S AND HIM TOO HE SENT TO WORK FOR THE KING AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS
WINDSOR AND CASTILE SOAP
DRIVING PACK ANIMALS WELL LADEN WITH WARM CLOTHING BLANKETS AND FOOD SUPPLIES LEFT THE FORT AT SUNRISE ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY THE FIRST AND ON THE THIRD REACHED JOHNSON'S RANCH
NEITHER OF THEM OFFERED TO DO SO THEN HE LAUGHED AT THEM FOR BEING SUCH COWARDS AND SAID WELL BROTHERS FAREWELL LOWER ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND DON'T GO AWAY FROM HERE BUT AS SOON AS THE CORD IS JERKED PULL IT UP
SO THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE ENOUGH OF IT THROUGH THE BAG TO MAKE THE SUDS A DEEP YELLOW PUT IN THE ARTICLES WHICH SHOULD BE CLEAN AND FREE FROM COLOR
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN THEY HAD THREE SONS TWO OF THEM WITH THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM BUT THE THIRD A SIMPLETON NOW THE KING HAD A DEER PARK IN WHICH WERE QUANTITIES OF WILD ANIMALS OF DIFFERENT KINDS
WHO HAS WRAPPED UP MY NESTLINGS AND PRESENTLY SEEING THE PRINCE SHE ADDED DIDST THOU DO THAT THANKS IN RETURN ASK OF ME ANYTHING THOU DESIREST
EMPTY OUT THE ALUM AND TARTAR WATER PUT FRESH WATER IN THE KETTLE AND FOR EACH POUND OF GOODS TO BE DYED PUT IN AN OUNCE OF COCHINEAL POWDERED FINE SET THE KETTLE ON THE FIRE
THEIR ROUTE TO THE SNOW BELT LAY THROUGH SECTIONS OF COUNTRY WHICH HAD BECOME SO SOFT AND OOZY THAT THE HORSES OFTEN SANK IN MIRE FLANK DEEP AND THE STREAMS WERE SO SWOLLEN THAT PROGRESS WAS ALARMINGLY SLOW ON THE SECOND DAY
THAT'S OUR SORT ALL TO PIECES WELL WE'D BETTER COME IN GRACEY LL THINK WE'RE AFRAID TO FACE HER WHEN WE WENT AWAY LAST GRACE STOREFIELD WAS A LITTLE OVER SEVENTEEN
STARING AND SMILING ALL OVER HER FACE THE MOMENT SHE SAW ME NOW SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN AND A SWEET LOOKING ONE TOO I COULDN'T LIFT HER UP AND KISS HER AS I USED TO DO
FIRST RATE WORK IT WAS TOO HE WAS ALWAYS A DEAD HAND AT SPLITTING THEN THERE WAS A BIG HAY SHED
HE WAS GOING TO SEE HIS WIFE BECAUSE HE HAD DETERMINED TO SEE HER ONCE A WEEK TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES AND BESIDES ON THAT DAY AS IT WAS THE FIFTEENTH HE HAD TO GIVE HIS WIFE SOME MONEY FOR HER EXPENSES ACCORDING TO THEIR USUAL ARRANGEMENT
WHEN GEORGE CAME IN HE BEGAN TO TALK TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AND TOLD US WHERE HE HAD BEEN A LONG WAY OUT IN SOME NEW BACK COUNTRY JUST TAKEN UP WITH SHEEP HE HAD GOT A FIRST RATE PAYING PRICE FOR HIS CARRIAGE OUT
SINCE HIS RETURN FROM ABROAD ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD TWICE BEEN AT THEIR COUNTRY VILLA ONCE HE DINED THERE ANOTHER TIME HE SPENT THE EVENING THERE WITH A PARTY OF FRIENDS
THE STEWARD DID NOT TAKE UP MUCH TIME HE SIMPLY GAVE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH THE MONEY HE NEEDED
EVERY LOOK OF HER SEEMED TO WISH TO DO YOU GOOD AND MAKE YOU THINK THAT NOTHING THAT WASN'T SQUARE AND RIGHT AND HONEST AND TRUE COULD LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE WITH HER SHE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO ME AND SAID WELL DICK SO YOU'RE BACK AGAIN
TALKING ABOUT THE PLACES I'D BEEN TO AND SHE WANTING TO KNOW EVERYTHING JIM DREW OFF A BIT WHEN THE ROAD GOT NARROW
CHAPTER FIFTEEN GEORGE STOREFIELD'S PLACE FOR THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD AND ALL THE PLACE BELONGED TO HIM AND GRACEY QUITE STUNNED JIM AND ME WE'D BEEN AWAY MORE THAN A YEAR AND HE'D PULLED DOWN THE OLD FENCES AND PUT UP NEW ONES
JUST THEN RISING FROM THE DEPTHS HE BEGAN TO BLEED VIOLENTLY
HE'S STRAINED TO THE UTMOST AND THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE BURDEN WEIGHING ON HIM AND NOT A LIGHT ONE CONCLUDED THE DOCTOR RAISING HIS EYEBROWS SIGNIFICANTLY
SHE FLEW TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT NORTH EAST WEST AND SOUTH BUT FOUND ON EVERY SIDE THE COMPANY PREPARED UPON THEIR NETS AT LENGTH SHE FLEW RIGHT UP SOARING AT A MOST ASTONISHING RATE TOWARDS THE SUN
THAT NONE BUT THE BLIND SHOULD BE HONOURED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT SO THAT WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO WRITE ANYTHING THEY UNIFORMLY DIPPED THEIR PENS INTO THE MACHINE CONTAINING SAND AND HAVING SCRAWLED OVER A PAGE AS THEY THOUGHT
AS HE WAS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING PERSON FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AND LIKELY TO BE USEFUL
BUT ALL THE SAME THOUGH HE NEVER ADMITTED IT TO HIMSELF AND HAD NO PROOFS NOT EVEN SUSPICIOUS EVIDENCE IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT HE WAS A DECEIVED HUSBAND AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY MISERABLE ABOUT IT
BUT THE DOCTOR A CELEBRATED PETERSBURG DOCTOR WHO WAS AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH TOOK UP A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD NOT EXPECTED HIM THAT DAY
WHILE THE COMPANY ON EVERY SIDE SET UP ONE GENERAL ACCLAMATION BUT GOG IN HIS BALLOON SOON STOPPED WAUWAU IN THE MIDST OF HER CAREER AND SNARED HER IN A NET THE CORDS OF WHICH HE CONTINUED TO HOLD IN HIS HAND
BEFORE EVERY JUDGE WAS PLACED A SQUARE INKSTAND CONTAINING A GALLON OF INK AND PENS OF A PROPORTIONABLE SIZE AND ALSO RIGHT BEFORE HIM AN ENORMOUS FOLIO
CALLED A WAUWAU THIS CREATURE WAS BROUGHT OVER THE GREAT BRIDGE BEFORE MENTIONED FROM THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA BY A BALLOON THE BALLOON WAS PLACED UPON THE BRIDGE EXTENDING OVER THE PARAPETS ON EACH SIDE
WHOSE PLANKS ARE THEY HE ASKED
ON WHICH THE INFLAMMABLE AIR RUSHING OUT THE WHOLE APPARATUS BEGAN TO TUMBLE TO THE EARTH WITH AMAZING RAPIDITY GOG HIMSELF WAS THROWN OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND LETTING GO THE REINS OF THE NET
I SEE GEORGE COMING SO I MUST GO AND FETCH IN DINNER
STRONGER THAN EVER I WAS SURPRISED AT MYSELF AND LOOKED QUEER I DARESAY THEN AILEEN LAUGHED AND JIM COMES TO THE RESCUE AND SAYS DICK DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU GRACEY YOU'VE GROWN SUCH A SWELL TOO
I WISH YOU'D NEVER DROPPED ACROSS HER AND THAT SHE WASN'T JEANIE'S SISTER BLURTS OUT JIM
DERANGED BY THE WINTER'S WORK THAT EVERY YEAR GREW HEAVIER AND JUST AS ALWAYS HE RETURNED IN JULY AND AT ONCE FELL TO WORK AS USUAL WITH INCREASED ENERGY AS USUAL TOO HIS WIFE HAD MOVED FOR THE SUMMER TO A VILLA OUT OF TOWN
WITH GREAT WINGS OR OARS TO ASSIST ITS VELOCITY AND UNDER THE BALLOON WAS PLACED PENDANT A KIND OF BOAT IN WHICH WERE THE PERSONS TO MANAGE THE STEERAGE OF THE MACHINE AND PROTECT WAUWAU THIS ORACULAR BIRD
AND FINISHED IT IN THE MORNING THEN PEOPLE BEGAN ARRIVING WITH PETITIONS AND THERE CAME THE REPORTS INTERVIEWS APPOINTMENTS DISMISSALS APPORTIONMENT OF REWARDS PENSIONS GRANTS NOTES THE WORKADAY ROUND
AND WHEN SHE DESIRED TO EXPRESS HER AFFIRMATIVE SHE NODDING MADE THE QUIZ PENDENT FROM HER MOUTH FLOW DOWN AND RECOIL AGAIN THE TRIAL PROCEEDED IN THIS MANNER FOR A LONG TIME TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE
I ONCE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF AN OLD SEALER HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY SENSITIVE ON THE POINT OF HONOUR WOULD RESENT AN INSULT AS PROMPTLY AS ANY KNIGHT ERRANT
OUR COMPANY IMMEDIATELY EMBARKED IN THE MACHINES BEFORE DESCRIBED IN WHICH WE HAD JOURNEYED INTO AFRICA AND AFTER A FEW DAYS SAIL ARRIVED IN NORTH AMERICA
AND SOMETIMES STRIPPING BARK AT WESTERN PORT AND PORTLAND BAY BEFORE THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AS MELBOURNE I WAS IN A WHALER FOR TWO YEARS ABOUT WILSON'S PROMONTORY UNTIL THE WHALES WERE ALL KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY
AND WHEN SUCH A ONE IS FOUND HE DESERVES HIS REWARD WE ADJOURNED TO THE BAR PARLOUR AND JACK HAD A GLASS OF BRANDY FOR WHICH HE DID NOT PAY
AILEEN WOULD HAVE MADE IT UP WITH HIM THAT VERY CHRISTMAS AND BEEN A HAPPY WOMAN ALL HER LIFE
AND YOU THINK SO MUCH OF IT I THOUGHT HE WOULD FEEL MORTIFIED IF I DIDN'T LET HIM TRY REPLIED KATY QUIETLY I DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL HURT IT WETHERELL'S MAN LIKES DORRY AND HE'LL SHOW HIM WHAT TO DO
AND ON THAT DAY THE POOP CABINS BUNKS AND THE SPARE DECK WERE SACRIFICED ON THE NEXT DAY THE NINETEENTH OF DECEMBER THE MASTS RAFTS AND SPARS WERE BURNED THE CREW WORKED LUSTILY KEEPING UP THE FIRES
ONLY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO HIT THE STRIKER WHEN YOU START THE PENDULUM HAVE YOU REALLY SAID KATY WHY DORRY YOU'RE A GENIUS I'M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED
MISTER FOGG HAD TAKEN AWAY THE MATCH AND I SHALL STILL HAVE THE IRON HULL
THE HENRIETTA WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN
OF COURSE ASS REPLIED THE DETECTIVE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL
STAY REPLIED MISTER FOGG CALMLY WITHOUT BETRAYING IN HIS FEATURES THAT BY A SUPREME INSPIRATION HE WAS ABOUT TO ATTEMPT ONCE MORE TO CONQUER ILL FORTUNE QUEENSTOWN IS THE IRISH PORT AT WHICH THE TRANS ATLANTIC STEAMERS STOP TO PUT OFF THE MAILS
SOMETIMES THE SCREW ROSE OUT OF THE WATER BEATING ITS PROTRUDING END WHEN A MOUNTAIN OF WATER RAISED THE STERN ABOVE THE WAVES BUT THE CRAFT ALWAYS KEPT STRAIGHT AHEAD THE WIND HOWEVER DID NOT GROW AS BOISTEROUS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FEARED IT WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE TEMPESTS WHICH BURST
SHE WAS NOT LEFT TO WONDER LONG ALMOST AS SHE SPOKE THERE WAS ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR
AND SHE WAS NOW OVER FOURTEEN CLOVER WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE TALL HER EYES WERE AS BLUE AND SWEET AS EVER
DON'T LET THIS ASTONISH YOU SIR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I SHALL LOSE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS UNLESS I ARRIVE IN LONDON BY A QUARTER BEFORE NINE ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER I MISSED THE STEAMER AT NEW YORK AND AS YOU REFUSED TO TAKE ME TO LIVERPOOL
IT DELIGHTED HER TO TURN UP HER HAIR AND SHE WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HAVING HER DRESSES MADE TO COME BELOW THE TOPS OF HER BOOTS SHE HAD ALSO LEFT OFF RUFFLES AND WORE NARROW COLLARS INSTEAD AND LITTLE CUFFS WITH SLEEVE BUTTONS TO FASTEN THEM
SHE EXPLAINED TO ELSIE AFTER THE OTHERS WERE GONE PULL THE ROCKING CHAIR A LITTLE THIS WAY ELSIE AND OH PUSH ALL THOSE LITTLE CHAIRS BACK AGAINST THE WALL MISSUS WORRETT BROKE DOWN IN ONE THE LAST TIME SHE WAS HERE DON'T YOU RECOLLECT
YOU KNOW HE LIKES THEM TO BE LEFT JUST SO WILL YOU PLEASE GO AND REMIND HER THAT SHE IS NOT TO TOUCH THEM AT ALL AFTER THE CARPET IS PUT DOWN I WANT YOU TO DUST THE TABLE SO AS TO BE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS PUT BACK IN THE SAME PLACE WILL YOU
THE HENRIETTA MIGHT CROSS THE THREE THOUSAND MILES FROM NEW YORK TO LIVERPOOL IN THE NINE DAYS BETWEEN THE TWELFTH AND THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER IT IS TRUE THAT ONCE ARRIVED THE AFFAIR ON BOARD THE HENRIETTA ADDED TO THAT OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MIGHT CREATE MORE DIFFICULTIES FOR MISTER FOGG
ONLY KISS ME FIRST BECAUSE I DIDN'T MEAN TO YOU KNOW PHILLY WAS VERY FOND OF KATY MISS PETINGILL SAID IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW THAT CHILD LET HIMSELF BE MANAGED BUT I THINK THE SECRET WAS THAT KATY DIDN'T MANAGE
YES WENT ON ELSIE AND YOU KNOW DORRY HELD HIS IN HIS MOUTH FOR EVER SO LONG AND THEN WENT ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND SPAT IT OUT PAPA SAID HE HAD A GOOD MIND TO MAKE HIM TAKE ANOTHER SPOONFUL
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ONE OF HIS EARS TO HEAR WITH THE OTHER WHAT THE ENGINEER WAS SAYING
AND IS TURNING OUT CLEVER IN SEVERAL WAYS AMONG THE REST HE HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG TURN FOR MECHANICS HERE'S YOUR CLOCK KATY HE SAID I'VE GOT IT FIXED SO THAT IT STRIKES ALL RIGHT
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILES FROM LIVERPOOL REPLIED MISTER FOGG WITH IMPERTURBABLE CALMNESS
THESE SLEEVE BUTTONS WHICH WERE A PRESENT FROM COUSIN HELEN CLOVER LIKED BEST OF ALL HER THINGS PAPA SAID THAT HE WAS SURE SHE TOOK THEM TO BED WITH HER BUT OF COURSE THAT WAS ONLY A JOKE THOUGH SHE CERTAINLY WAS NEVER SEEN WITHOUT THEM IN THE DAYTIME
AND TALK IT OVER WITH THEM TOGETHER YOU COULD HIT ON JUST THE RIGHT THING
THEN HE DEPARTED WITH THE CLOCK UNDER HIS ARM WHILE CLOVER CALLED AFTER HIM TEASINGLY LUNCH AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO O'CLOCK DON'T FORGET NO I WON'T SAID DORRY
YOU WERE REAL GOOD TO DO IT RESPONDED CLOVER BUT IF IT HAD BEEN MINE I DON'T THINK I COULD JUST THEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND JOHNNIE RUSHED IN
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WOOD SHED SINCE THE DAY OF HER FALL FROM THE SWING NEVER MIND MARY I'LL TALK TO ALEXANDER ABOUT IT AND HE SHALL MAKE IT ALL NICE MARY TROTTED DOWN STAIRS SATISFIED
AND HELP HERSELF TO WHAT SHE WANTED WITHOUT TROUBLING ANYBODY IT WAS ONLY LATELY THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO USE IT DOCTOR CARR CONSIDERED HER DOING SO AS A HOPEFUL SIGN BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD KATY THIS SHE HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HER INVALID LIFE AT LAST
YOU WOULD ENJOY IT I KNOW LET ME SEE PERHAPS I HAVE AND SHE PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LETTER
WHY OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT RIPE SAID CLOVER PUTTING ONE INTO HER MOUTH CAN'T YOU TELL BY THE TASTE THEY'RE AS GREEN AS CAN BE I DON'T CARE IF KATY SAYS THEY'RE RIPE I SHALL EAT EM
REPLIED MISTER FOGG KEEP THEM UP TO THE LAST LET THE VALVES BE FILLED TOWARDS NOON PHILEAS FOGG HAVING ASCERTAINED THEIR POSITION CALLED PASSEPARTOUT AND ORDERED HIM TO GO FOR CAPTAIN SPEEDY
I'LL SEE WHAT SHE WANTS BUT CLOVER WAS ALREADY HALF WAY ACROSS THE HALL AND THE TWO GIRLS RAN UP SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS OFTEN A LITTLE STRIFE BETWEEN THEM AS TO WHICH SHOULD ANSWER KATY'S BELL BOTH LIKED TO WAIT ON HER SO MUCH KATY CAME TO MEET THEM AS THEY ENTERED
IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF BURSTING WHERE ARE WE WERE THE FIRST WORDS HIS ANGER PERMITTED HIM TO UTTER HAD THE POOR MAN BEEN AN APOPLECTIC HE COULD NEVER HAVE RECOVERED FROM HIS PAROXYSM OF WRATH
AND RUSH ON WITH A SPEED OF NINETY MILES AN HOUR IT CONTINUED FRESH BUT UNHAPPILY IT REMAINED OBSTINATELY IN THE SOUTH EAST RENDERING THE SAILS USELESS THE SIXTEENTH OF DECEMBER WAS THE SEVENTY FIFTH DAY SINCE PHILEAS FOGG'S DEPARTURE FROM LONDON AND THE HENRIETTA HAD NOT YET BEEN SERIOUSLY DELAYED
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST AS GOOD AS HE COULD BE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SAID IN REPLY TO THIS
KATY COULD NOT THINK WHO IT WAS AT FIRST
SHE CERTAINLY SMOKED SIX OR EIGHT MOTHER GAVE IN SOON I THINK SHE ONLY DID IT OUT OF VANITY AMERICAN LADY HAD BEEN SMOKING ALL THE MORNING I TOOK NO MORE AND DAUGHTER AND THE FRENCHMEN HAD IT ALL TO THEMSELVES
ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE WRITER OF THIS NOTICE PAID HER A VISIT AND TOOK HER AS A BROTHER PIPER A PRESENT OF TOBACCO WHICH INGREDIENT OF BLISS WAS ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE FROM HER VISITORS
WHERE HE FOUND HE HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH THE FAMILY OF HIS HOSTESS
SHE ASKED DICKENS IF HE HAD EVER READ SUCH INFERNAL TRASH AS MISSUS GORE'S AND EXCLAIMED OH GOD WHAT A SERMON WE HAD HERE LAST SUNDAY DICKENS AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WERE DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY AS WE AGREED AFTERWARDS
MASCULINE ATTIRE AND TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THE USUAL CONVENTIONS OF FEMININE DRESS WOULD NATURALLY SEEK TO IMITATE MEN IN OTHER WAYS ALSO LEECH HAD A PICTURE OF A QUIET SMOKE IN PUNCH WHICH DEPICTED FIVE LADIES IN SHORT WIDE SKIRTS AND BLOOMERS IN A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP
DICKENS WAS AT LAUSANNE AND GENEVA IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX AT HIS HOTEL IN GENEVA HE MET A REMARKABLE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BOTH ENGLISH WHO ADMIRED HIM GREATLY AND WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AT GENOA
WE ARE INFORMED IN THE USUAL STYLE OF SUCH PAGES THAT THE WELL DRESSED WOMAN HAS BEGUN TO CONSIDER THE LITTLE SMOKING JACKET INDISPENSABLE
TIS MORE THAN MOST INTOLERABLE AND SIMILAR INDICATIONS OF DISLIKE TO SMOKING COULD BE QUOTED FROM OTHER PLAYS ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM COMPARATIVELY EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE TO BE FOUND HERE AND THERE WOMEN WHO SMOKED
MISSUS GARBUTT HAD BEEN TWICE MARRIED HER HUSBANDS HAVING BEEN SAILORS DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS THE OLD WOMAN SAID THE JOURNAL HAD DWINDLED INTO A SMALL COMPASS BUT SHE WAS FREE FROM PAIN RETAINING ALL HER FACULTIES TO THE LAST AND ENJOYING HER PIPE
DUNTON IN THAT ATHENIAN ORACLE WHICH WAS A KIND OF EARLY FORERUNNER OF NOTES AND QUERIES ALLUDED TO PIPE SMOKING BY THE GOOD WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE WEST
IN SIXTEEN THIRTY ONE EDMOND HOWES WHO EDITED STOW'S CHRONICLES AND CONTINUED THEM ONTO THE END OF THIS PRESENT YEARE SIXTEEN THIRTY ONE WROTE THAT TOBACCO WAS AT THIS DAY COMMONLY USED BY MOST MEN AND MANY WOMEN
AND IF THEY HAVE DAUGHTERS THESE ALSO ARE OF THE COMPANY TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS AT TABLE WITH PLEASANT CONCEITS WHERE THEY DRINK AS MUCH AS THE MEN BUT WHAT QUITE DISGUSTED OUR VISITOR WAS THAT WHEN ONE DRINKS THE HEALTH OF ANY PERSON IN COMPANY
AN OLD SEVEN DIALS BALLAD HAS THE FOLLOWING CHOICE STANZA WHEN FIRST I SAW MISS BAILEY TWAS ON A SATURDAY AT THE CORNER PIN SHE WAS DRINKING GIN AND SMOKING A YARD OF CLAY
ONE OF THE FREAKS OF FASHION AT PARIS WAS THE GIVING OF LUNCHEON PARTIES FOR LADIES ONLY AT WHICH CIGARS WERE HANDED ROUND
MANY ROYAL LADIES OF EUROPE CONTEMPORARIES OF QUEEN VICTORIA AND HER SON HAVE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING CONFIRMED SMOKERS
THE REV GILES MOORE RECTOR OF HORSTED KEYNES SUSSEX MADE A NOTE IN HIS JOURNAL AND ACCOUNT BOOK IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE OF
THERE IS A TRADITION THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH HERSELF ONCE SMOKED WITH UNPLEASANT RESULTS
NOR HAS THE PRACTICE BY ANY MEANS YET DIED OUT
ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIRST SEVENTEEN TEN HE WROTE I HAVE THE FINEST PIECE OF BRAZIL TOBACCO FOR DINGLEY THAT EVER WAS BORN
THAT EITHER SHEE MUST ALSO CORRUPT HER SWEETE BREATH THEREWITH OR ELSE RESOLVE TO LIVE IN A PERPETUALL STINKING TORMENT HIS MAJESTY'S STYLE WAS FORCIBLE IF NOT ELEGANT
WITH US FOUR IN THE CENTRE PULLING AWAY BRAVELY WHILE AMERICAN LADY RELATED STORIES OF HER HOOKAH UPSTAIRS
PUNCH'S POCKET BOOK FOR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HAD AN AMUSING SKIT ON A LADIES READING PARTY TO WHICH MISTER PUNCH ACTED AS COACH AFTER BREAKFAST THE READING LADIES LOUNGED ON THE LAWN WITH CIGARETTES
WHO SOLD BEER AND TOBACCO AT HIS SHOPP IN ROMFORD AND A GOOD FRIEND AND CUSTOMER OF HIS NAMED ELIZABETH SAVAGE WHO SAD TO SAY WAS DESCRIBED AS MUCH GIVEN TO STRONGE DRINCKE AND TOBACCO
BUT EVEN THIS WAS NOT ALL FOR PRESENTLY TWO FRENCHMEN CAME IN WITH WHOM AND THE AMERICAN LADY DAUGHTER SAT DOWN TO WHIST THE FRENCHMEN SMOKED OF COURSE THEY WERE REALLY MODEST GENTLEMEN AND SEEMED DISMAYED AND DAUGHTER PLAYED FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO WITH A CIGAR CONTINUALLY IN HER MOUTH NEVER OUT OF IT
AND SOE SIT ROUND THE FIRE SMOAKING WHICH WAS NOT DELIGHTFUL TO ME WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TALK WITH MY LANDLADY FOR INFORMATION OF ANY MATTER AND CUSTOMES AMONGST THEM WHAT WOULD KING JAMES HAVE THOUGHT OF THESE DEPRAVED CORNISH FOLK
THE OLD IRISHWOMEN WHO WERE ONCE A FAMILIAR FEATURE OF LONDON STREET LIFE AS SELLERS OF APPLES AND OTHER SMALL WARES AT STREET CORNERS
A STORY IS TOLD OF SIR WALTER RALEIGH BY JOHN AUBREY WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT AT FIRST WOMEN NOT ONLY DID NOT SMOKE BUT THAT THEY DISLIKED SMOKING BY MEN AUBREY SAYS THAT RALEIGH STANDING IN A STAND AT SIR R POYNTZ'S PARKE AT ACTON TOOKE A PIPE OF TOBACCO
AND HAD ALSO UNDERTAKEN TO GRANT HER HUSBAND A LICENCE TO BREW THUS UNDULY INFLUENCING AND CORRUPTING THE ELECTORS
WRITING TO HER HUSBAND ISAAC APPLETON AT HIS CHAMBER IN GRAYES INN AS HIS AFEXTINAT WIFE THE GOOD SUSAN WHOSE SPELLING IS MARVELLOUS TELLS HER SWEET HART I HAVE DONE ALL THE TOBAKCRE YOU LEFT MEE
AND WHY SHOULD THEY WONDER AT IT IN TRUTH OUR WONDERMENTS ARE VERY PLEASANT THINGS
OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CIGARETTE SMOKING IS INDULGED IN NOW BY WOMEN IS A QUESTION QUITE UNANSWERABLE YET QUEEN VICTORIA ONCE RECEIVED A PRESENT OF PIPES AND TOBACCO
BUT THESE STORIES REST ON VAGUE TRADITION AND PROBABLY HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT
QUOTES AN ADVERTISEMENT BY A DUBLIN TOBACCONIST OF MILD PIGTAIL FOR LADIES WHICH SUGGESTS THE ALARMING QUESTION DID IRISH LADIES CHEW
WHICH MADE THE LADIES QUITT IT TILL HE HAD DONE BUT THIS OBJECTION WHETHER GENERAL OR NOT SOON VANISHED FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER THE GALLANT OF ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DAYS
DINED BY INVITATION WITH THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE DAUGHTER ASKED HIM IF HE SMOKED YES SAID DICKENS I GENERALLY TAKE A CIGAR AFTER DINNER WHEN I'M ALONE
THE WOMAN IS PLAINLY A CONVIVIAL SOUL BUT THERE IS NO PIPE FOR HER AND SUCH PROVISION WAS NO DOUBT UNUSUAL THERE IS DIRECT EVIDENCE TOO BESIDES THE STORY IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS CHAPTER THAT WOMEN DISLIKED THE PREVALENCE OF SMOKING
FAITH KIND UNCLE WHEN MEN ABANDON JEALOUSY FORSAKE TAKING OF TOBACCO AND CEASE TO WEAR THEIR BEARDS SO RUDELY LONG OH TO HAVE A HUSBAND WITH A MOUTH CONTINUALLY SMOKING WITH A BUSH OF FURS ON THE RIDGE OF HIS CHIN READIE STILL TO FLOP INTO HIS FOAMING CHOPS
IT WAS OF SUCH RICH CHARACTER THAT BEING CHEAPLY MINED BY GREATLY IMPROVED AND INEXPENSIVE METHODS
MINGLED IN ITS MASS AND THIRD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS AT A COST SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO GIVE THE PRODUCT A COMMERCIAL VALUE
THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND FORGOTTEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS OF MORE THAN USUAL IMPORT AND SERIOUSNESS AS EDISON WAS VIRTUALLY HIS OWN BACKER PUTTING INTO THE COMPANY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF ALL THE FORTUNE HIS INVENTIONS HAD BROUGHT HIM
EDISON'S NATIVE SHREWDNESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE WAS PUT TO PRACTICAL USE IN THE BUSY DAYS OF PLANT CONSTRUCTION IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP MECHANICS ON ACCOUNT OF INDIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONS AFFORDED BY THE TINY VILLAGE REMOTE FROM CIVILIZATION AMONG THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS OF NEW JERSEY
WHEN THIS DECISION WAS REACHED MISTER EDISON AND I TOOK THE JERSEY CENTRAL TRAIN FROM EDISON BOUND FOR ORANGE AND I DID NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE AS THE CONCENTRATING PLANT WAS HEAVILY IN DEBT WITHOUT ANY EARLY PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF ITS INDEBTEDNESS
WHILE THE COARSER PARTICLES WERE IN LIKE MANNER AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED TO THE ROLLS FOR FURTHER REDUCTION IN A NARRATIVE NOT INTENDED TO BE STRICTLY TECHNICAL IT WOULD PROBABLY TIRE THE READER TO FOLLOW THIS MATERIAL IN DETAIL THROUGH THE NUMEROUS STEPS ATTENDING THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION
THE ROCK BROKEN UP INTO PIECES ABOUT THE SIZE OF MARBLES HAVING BEEN DRIED AND CONVEYED TO THE STOCK HOUSE THE SURPLUSAGE WAS AUTOMATICALLY CARRIED OUT FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STOCK HOUSE BY CONVEYORS TO PASS THROUGH THE NEXT PROCESS
THE BELT WOULD AGAIN COME INTO PLAY AND ONCE MORE SPEED UP THE ROLLS FOR A REPETITION OF THEIR REGULAR PRIZE FIGHTER DUTY ON LEAVING THE GIANT ROLLS THE ROCKS HAVING BEEN REDUCED TO PIECES NOT LARGER THAN FOURTEEN INCHES PASSED INTO THE SERIES OF INTERMEDIATE ROLLS OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
I HAD A NUMBER OF MEN SURVEY A STRIP REACHING FROM LOWER CANADA TO NORTH CAROLINA THE ONLY INSTRUMENT WE USED WAS THE SPECIAL MAGNETIC NEEDLE WE STARTED IN LOWER CANADA AND TRAVELLED ACROSS THE LINE OF MARCH TWENTY FIVE MILES THEN ADVANCED SOUTH ONE THOUSAND FEET
THAT MISTER EDISON'S WORK WAS APPRECIATED AT THE TIME IS MADE EVIDENT BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING THE EDISON PLANT PUBLISHED IN THE IRON AGE OF OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN IN WHICH AFTER MENTIONING HIS STRUGGLE WITH ADVERSE CONDITIONS IT SAYS
AND IT IS NOW TO BE NOTED THAT THE PRODUCT HE HAD STRIVEN SO SEDULOUSLY TO OBTAIN WAS A HIGHLY COMMERCIAL ONE FOR NOT ONLY DID THE BRIQUETTES OF CONCENTRATED ORE FULFIL THE PURPOSE OF THEIR CREATION BUT IN USE ACTUALLY TENDED TO INCREASE THE WORKING CAPACITY OF THE FURNACE
HAVING DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS OF NEW JERSEY I CONSTRUCTED A VERY SENSITIVE MAGNETIC NEEDLE
THUS WE FIND NUMEROUS INSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE LAST CENTURY OF EXPERIMENTS ALONG THIS LINE AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS DURING WHICH VARIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHERS THAN EDISON TO PERFECT MAGNETIC SEPARATION AND BRING IT UP TO SOMETHING LIKE COMMERCIAL PRACTICE
THE RICHNESS OF THE ORE AND ITS PURITY OF COURSE AFFECT THE LIMESTONE CONSUMPTION IN THE CASE OF THE CRANE TRIAL THERE WAS A REDUCTION FROM THIRTY PER CENT TO TWELVE PER CENT OF THE ORE CHARGE FINALLY THE FUEL CONSUMPTION IS REDUCED WHICH IN THE CASE OF THE EASTERN PLANTS WITH THEIR RELATIVELY COSTLY COKE
AND THAT BUSINESS WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING WESTWARD
DUE LARGELY TO THE PANICKY CONDITIONS AND A LARGE PAY ROLL HAD BEEN RAISED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY A SHORT TIME BEFORE PAY DAY OUR TREASURER CALLED ME UP BY TELEPHONE AND SAID
FIRST TO FIND A SUITABLE CHEAP BINDING MATERIAL AND SECOND ITS NATURE MUST BE SUCH THAT VERY LITTLE WOULD BE NECESSARY PER TON OF CONCENTRATES THESE SEVERE REQUIREMENTS WERE STAGGERING BUT MISTER EDISON'S COURAGE DID NOT FALTER ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A WELL NIGH HOPELESS TASK
THIS SAND WAS TRANSPORTED AUTOMATICALLY BY BELT CONVEYORS TO THE REAR OF THE WORKS TO BE STORED AND SOLD BEING SHARP CRYSTALLINE AND EVEN IN QUALITY IT WAS A VALUABLE BY PRODUCT FINDING A READY SALE FOR BUILDING PURPOSES RAILWAY SAND BOXES AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL USES
BUT HE ALSO DEVISED COLLATERAL MACHINERY METHODS AND PROCESSES ALL FUNDAMENTAL IN THEIR NATURE THESE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO SPECIFY IN DETAIL AS THEY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PLANT BUT THE PRINCIPAL ONES ARE WORTHY OF MENTION SUCH AS
NOT ONLY DID HE DEVELOP THOROUGHLY THE REFINING OF THE CRUSHED ORE SO THAT AFTER IT HAD PASSED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MAGNETS IN THE MILL THE CONCENTRATES CAME OUT FINALLY CONTAINING NINETY ONE TO NINETY THREE PER CENT
IT IS NOT EASY TO APPRECIATE TO THE FULL THE DARING EXEMPLIFIED IN THESE GREAT CRUSHING ROLLS OR RATHER ROCK CRACKERS
TO FOLLOW HIS NATURAL BENT IN BEING SURROUNDED DAY AND NIGHT BY HIS RESPONSIBLE CHOSEN ASSOCIATES WITH WHOM HE WORKED UNINTERRUPTED BY OUTSIDERS FROM EARLY MORNING AWAY INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING THOSE WHO WERE LABORING WITH HIM INSPIRED BY HIS UNFLAGGING ENTHUSIASM
THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING A UNIFORM CONCENTRATE WAS A MOST SERIOUS OBJECTION HAD THERE NOT INDEED BEEN OTHER DIFFICULTIES WHICH RENDERED THIS METHOD COMMERCIALLY IMPRACTICABLE IT IS QUITE NATURAL THEREFORE THAT THE IDEA OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO MANY INVENTORS
THE WHOLE CRUSHING OPERATION OF REDUCTION FROM MASSIVE BOULDERS TO SMALL PEBBLY PIECES HAVING BEEN DONE IN LESS TIME THAN THE TELLING HAS OCCUPIED THE PRODUCT WAS CONVEYED TO THE DRYER A TOWER NINE FEET SQUARE AND FIFTY FEET HIGH
FOR EDISON'S METHODS ALWAYS ICONOCLASTIC WHEN PROGRESS IS IN SIGHT WERE PARTICULARLY SO AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT EDISON'S SCRAP HEAP CONTAINS THE ELEMENTS OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION
THE PROBLEM INCLUDED HANDLING AND CRUSHING THE RUN OF THE MINE WITHOUT SELECTION THE STEAM SHOVEL DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BUT PICKED UP HANDILY SINGLE PIECES WEIGHING FIVE OR SIX TONS AND LOADED THEM ON THE SKIPS WITH QUANTITIES OF SMALLER LUMPS
WHICH BESIDES HAVING A VERY LARGE WORKING CAPACITY BY GRAVITY ELIMINATED ALL POWER EXCEPT THAT REQUIRED TO ELEVATE THE MATERIAL THE SCREENING PROCESS ALLOWED THE FINEST PART OF THE CRUSHED ROCK TO PASS ON BY CONVEYOR BELTS TO THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS
THESE FIGURES PROVE THAT THE YIELD OF THE FURNACE IS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THE CRANE TRIAL WAS TOO SHORT TO SETTLE THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT MAY BE CARRIED THIS INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF COURSE MEANS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF LABOR AND OF GENERAL EXPENSES
REDUCED TO ITS BAREST CRUDEST TERMS THE PROPOSITION OF MAGNETIC SEPARATION IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF A PIECE OF THE ORE MAGNETITE MAY BE REDUCED TO POWDER AND THE ORE PARTICLES SEPARATED THEREFROM BY THE HELP OF A SIMPLE HAND MAGNET TO ELUCIDATE THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF EDISON'S METHOD
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER WITHOUT LAUGHTER HOW I ONCE SEDUCED A LADY WHO WAS DEVOTED TO HER HUSBAND HER CHILDREN AND HER PRINCIPLES WHAT FUN IT WAS AND HOW LITTLE TROUBLE AND THE LADY REALLY HAD PRINCIPLES
I REFLECTED THAT AVDOTYA ROMANOVNA WAS AFTER ALL A BEGGAR
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT IT YOURSELF RASKOLNIKOV FELT MORE AND MORE IRRITATED SVIDRIGAILOV LOOKED AT HIM ATTENTIVELY AND RASKOLNIKOV FANCIED HE CAUGHT A FLASH OF SPITEFUL MOCKERY IN THAT LOOK BUT SVIDRIGAILOV RESTRAINED HIMSELF
ONE DAY AFTER DINNER
HERE IS MADAME DE KAPERNAUMOV HERSELF HEY WHAT SHE IS RATHER DEAF HAS SHE GONE OUT WHERE DID YOU HEAR SHE IS NOT IN AND WON'T BE TILL LATE IN THE EVENING PROBABLY
BUT IT'S FASCINATING ISN'T IT IT IS FASCINATING HA HA YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW I TALKED TO THE PAPA AND MAMMA
SHE FANCIED HE WAS SIGNALLING TO BEG HER NOT TO SPEAK TO HER BROTHER BUT TO COME TO HIM THAT WAS WHAT DOUNIA DID SHE STOLE BY HER BROTHER AND WENT UP TO SVIDRIGAILOV LET US MAKE HASTE AWAY
IN FACT I TRIUMPHED WHILE MY LADY REMAINED FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT SHE WAS INNOCENT CHASTE AND FAITHFUL TO ALL HER DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS AND HAD SUCCUMBED
HAVE MERCY ON ME MY GOOD FRIEND I AM A SINFUL MAN HA HA HA
AND MY BROTHER WON'T SEE US I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SUCH AS I NEVER SAW IN MY DAY YES THERE YOU HAVE PROGRESS ALL OF A SUDDEN I SAW A LITTLE GIRL OF THIRTEEN NICELY DRESSED DANCING WITH A SPECIALIST IN THAT LINE WITH ANOTHER ONE
BOTH STOOD STILL AND GAZED AT ONE ANOTHER AS THOUGH MEASURING THEIR STRENGTH
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THERE WAS SOMETIMES A LIGHT IN THEM WHICH FRIGHTENED HER AND GREW STRONGER AND STRONGER AND MORE UNGUARDED TILL IT WAS HATEFUL TO HER NO NEED TO GO INTO DETAIL BUT WE PARTED THERE I ACTED STUPIDLY AGAIN
FEEL PITY FOR ME PITY FOR A LOST SOUL AND IF ONCE A GIRL'S HEART IS MOVED TO PITY IT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING SHE IS BOUND TO WANT TO SAVE HIM
LAY THEM ALL ASIDE THEY ARE NOTHING TO YOU NOW HA HA YOU'LL SAY YOU ARE STILL A MAN AND A CITIZEN IF SO YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GOT INTO THIS COIL
AND ALL THE REST GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO DEBAUCHERY FROM THE FIRST HOUR THE TOWN REEKED OF ITS FAMILIAR ODOURS I CHANCED TO BE IN A FRIGHTFUL DEN I LIKE MY DENS DIRTY
MY EXPLANATION IS THAT MARFA PETROVNA WAS AN ARDENT AND IMPRESSIONABLE WOMAN AND SIMPLY
AND MEAN TO CARRY THEM OUT PROMPTLY WHAT HAVE I DROPPED WORDS LIKE THAT SVIDRIGAILOV ASKED IN NAIVE DISMAY TAKING NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE
AND I AM PROUD OF IT BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF AN ACQUAINTANCE AS YOU KNOW ONE IS APT TO BE MORE HEEDLESS AND STUPID ONE DOESN'T SEE CLEARLY HANG IT ALL WHY IS SHE SO HANDSOME
OH WELL IF YOU WON'T AGREE TO COME WITH ME I SHALL REFUSE TO GIVE ANY EXPLANATION AND GO AWAY AT ONCE BUT I BEG YOU NOT TO FORGET THAT A VERY CURIOUS SECRET OF YOUR BELOVED BROTHER'S
WE MUST RENOUNCE CERTAIN PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS AND OUR HABITUAL ATTITUDE TO THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ABOUT US I HAVE REASON TO HAVE FAITH IN YOUR JUDGMENT
RASKOLNIKOV WALKED OUT AFTER HIM SVIDRIGAILOV WAS NOT HOWEVER VERY DRUNK THE WINE HAD AFFECTED HIM FOR A MOMENT BUT IT WAS PASSING OFF EVERY MINUTE HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING
YOU ARE TIRED OF IT COME FOR A DRIVE I BELIEVE IT WILL COME ON TO RAIN NEVER MIND WE'LL PUT DOWN THE HOOD SVIDRIGAILOV WAS ALREADY IN THE CARRIAGE RASKOLNIKOV DECIDED THAT HIS SUSPICIONS
REGRETTED THAT IT WASN'T YOUR SISTER'S FATE TO BE BORN IN THE SECOND
WOULD DEVOTE ALL HER LIFE EVERY MINUTE OF HER LIFE WOULD SACRIFICE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING
AND WOULD DECLARE THAT SHE HAD RESISTED
AND THEY'VE TWO LITTLE NEPHEWS ON THEIR HANDS AS THOUGH THEIR OWN CHILDREN WERE NOT ENOUGH AND THEY'VE TAKEN FROM SCHOOL THEIR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER A GIRL WHO'LL BE SIXTEEN IN ANOTHER MONTH
TO BRING HIM TO HIS SENSES AND LIFT HIM UP AND DRAW HIM TO NOBLER AIMS AND RESTORE HIM TO NEW LIFE AND USEFULNESS WELL WE ALL KNOW HOW FAR SUCH DREAMS CAN GO
SEIZED HER AND BEGAN WHIRLING HER ROUND AND PERFORMING BEFORE HER EVERYONE LAUGHED AND I LIKE YOUR PUBLIC EVEN THE CANCAN PUBLIC THEY LAUGHED AND SHOUTED SERVES HER RIGHT SERVES HER RIGHT
IS THAT TRUE DON'T REFER TO THOSE VULGAR TALES I BEG SAID SVIDRIGAILOV WITH DISGUST AND ANNOYANCE
SUDDENLY SHE SAW SVIDRIGAILOV COMING QUICKLY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HAY MARKET HE SEEMED TO BE APPROACHING CAUTIOUSLY HE DID NOT GO ON TO THE BRIDGE BUT STOOD ASIDE ON THE PAVEMENT
SPEAK TO ME HERE YOU CAN TELL IT ALL IN THE STREET IN THE FIRST PLACE I CAN'T SAY IT IN THE STREET SECONDLY YOU MUST HEAR SOFYA SEMYONOVNA TOO AND THIRDLY I WILL SHOW YOU SOME PAPERS
AND INTO OUR BUSINESS IT WILL NOT BE OF MUCH USE TO US THE SOUND OF A WELL KNOWN VOICE ARRESTED JANE'S ATTENTION IT WAS THAT OF WILLIAM DALZELL WHO WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH MISTER MISSUS AND MISS RENNIE VERY CORDIALLY AND THEN
AFTER ALL HER MOTHER'S SOLICITUDE IT WOULD BE HARD IF SHE TOO WERE SACRIFICED SO FAR AS I CAN SEE SHE APPEARS TO BE HAPPY THE HUSBAND IS OF SUITABLE YEARS AND GOOD CHARACTER NOT SO BRILLIANT AS HIS WIFE
MISS WILSON WAS WARD OF MISSUS RENNIE'S AS JANE HAD HEARD A WEST INDIAN HEIRESS SOMEWHAT STUPID AND VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HER OWN WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE MISS RENNIE HAD A PITYING SORT OF LIKING FOR HER
AND REGRETTED THAT SHE COULD WRITE NOTHING INTERESTING IN RETURN WHEN SHE CAME HOME AFTER A LONG DAY'S WORK SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO TRY TO KEEP UP A LITTLE OF HER SISTER'S DISCIPLINE WITH THE LOWRIES AND WENT OVER THEIR LESSONS WITH THEM
IS SHE HANDSOME ASKED JANE NO
TO PEGGY AND THE OLD MAN DOCTOR PHILLIPS HAD WISHED THAT ELSIE SHOULD JOIN HER SISTER BEFORE SHE LEFT DERBYSHIRE AND SPEND A WEEK OR SO AT HIS HOUSE FOR HE HAD BEEN SO DELIGHTED WITH JANE THAT HE HAD A DESIRE TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH ELSIE ALSO
TOM USED TO BRING TO HER THE MOST PUZZLING QUESTIONS WHICH SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER AND MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO DO SO BUT INSTEAD OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORK REFRESHING HER AFTER THE SEDENTARY NEEDLEWORK
CHAPTER THREE ELSIE'S SITUATION IT WAS NOT MERE FANCY ON JANE'S PART THAT ELSIE WAS ILL AND UNHAPPY
AND I WILL HELP HIM TO DO SO WE WOMEN HAVE NO CAREER FOR OURSELVES AND WE MUST FIND ROOM FOR AMBITION SOMEWHERE
CERTAINLY THE TWO GIRLS IN MOURNING WERE NOT THE PLAINEST LOOKING IN THE ROOM NEITHER SISTER WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT ELSIE WAS VERY NEARLY SO AND HER RECENT SUFFERING HAD THROWN MORE INTENSITY INTO HER EXPRESSION
WELL LAURA DEAR HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT THE DRESSES CONTINUED MISS RENNIE IN A LOUDER VOICE
HAVE A SORT OF CONVICT ORIGIN MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AT THAT TIME FOR THEM THAN FOR RETIRED INDIANS TO GET INTO GENERAL SOCIETY THERE WAS NO NICE DISTINCTION DRAWN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COLONIES BETWEEN NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA
FOR YOU ARE PROVING YOURSELF THE GOOD MASTER THE CONSCIENTIOUS STEWARD OF THE BOUNTIES OF PROVIDENCE THAT I HOPED YOU WOULD BE
WHAT AN EXCELLENT IDEA SAID JANE I KNEW YOU WOULD SYMPATHIZE WITH THIS PLAN AND WITH ANOTHER WHICH I HAVE ALSO IN MY HEAD TO BUILD NEW COTTAGES FOR ALL THE AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS ON THE ESTATE
JANE WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED IN OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMANDED INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT SHE HAD ACCESS TO BOOKS SHE WENT TO THEATRES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT EVEN MORE THAN SHE CARED FOR
ELSIE WISHED THAT SHE COULD BE OUT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT BEFORE MISS WILSON'S WEDDING ORDER CAME TO IT SO SHE WAS VERY GLAD WHEN AFTER A LONGER DAY THAN USUAL
BY BUILDING A NEW WING AND ADDING A CONSERVATORY IN THE PLACE OF YOUR MODEST LITTLE GREENHOUSE EVERY ONE KNOWS I HAVE COME TO THE ESTATE WITH MONEY IN HAND INSTEAD OF ENCUMBRANCES TO CLEAR OFF AS SO MANY PROPRIETORS HAVE
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UP THE CLASSES THAT I HOPED FOR I THINK I MUST TAKE TO MISSUS DUNN'S AND THE DRESSMAKING FOR WE CANNOT GO ON AS WE ARE DOING AH JANE MY CUP OF PROSPERITY HAS VERY MANY BITTER DROPS IN IT
SAID JANE SMILING WE HAVE WRITTEN SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER THAT WE HAVE ALL THE MORE TO SAY JANE SAID HER COUSIN I NEVER GET A LETTER FROM YOU WITHOUT ITS MAKING ME WISH TO TALK OVER IT WITH YOU YOU HAVE NO NEWS HOWEVER I SUPPOSE
AND MINE OF ADVERSITY HAS MUCH THAT IS SALUTARY AND EVEN SWEET IN IT DO NOT THINK ME SO VERY UNHAPPY IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME BEFOREHAND OF THESE MONTHS THAT I HAVE PASSED SINCE MY UNCLE'S DEATH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEM ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE
AT THE BACK OF THE BLACK HILL AS IT IS CALLED I WOULD DIVIDE IT INTO ALLOTMENTS AMONG THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS AND ENERGETIC OF MY FARM LABOURERS AND SHOW THEM THE METHOD PURSUED BY THE FLEMISH FARMERS
WOULD HAVE COME TO THE HOUSE BUT FOR YOU BUT THIS MARRIAGE AMUSES ME A GOOD DEAL I'M SURE YOUR SISTER WAS FIFTY TIMES TOO GOOD FOR HIM AND LAURA AND HE WILL JUST SUIT EACH OTHER HE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO HER FORTUNE
LOST HER RELISH FOR BOTH SHE HAS FELT THAT HER ESTIMATE OF HER POWERS HAS BEEN TOO GREAT AND NOW IT IS FAR TOO HUMBLE FOR MYSELF I THINK JUST AS HIGHLY OF MY OWN ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS AS EVER I DID
WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF WINDOWS EXACTLY ON THE SAME MODEL SEEMED ALWAYS STARING HER OUT OF COUNTENANCE AND MADE HER FEEL DEPRESSED EVEN IN THE EARLY MORNING SHE FELT THE KEEN PIERCING EAST WINDS OF AN EDINBURGH SPRING AS SHE HAD NEVER DONE AT CROSS HALL
FOR MISSUS PHILLIPS HAS BEEN SO GOOD AS TO ASK ME TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS IN LONDON AND MISSUS DUNN IS GOING TO SPARE ME WELL I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MISS THOMSON FOR IT SEEMS TO ME YOU WANT A CHANGE AND A REST
THAN A CENTURY BACK I HAVE GOT PLANS FOR THE COTTAGES WHICH I WANTED YOU TO LOOK AT THIS MORNING I THINK THEY WILL DO YOU
NO NEWS SAID JANE I WROTE TO YOU OF ELSIE'S LAST BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS A CRUEL LETTER SHE FELT IT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE SHE SAYS IT IS ALL TRUE BUT REALLY FRANCIS
OR SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA IN THOSE DAYS A SLIGHT SAVOUR OF BOTANY BAY WAS SUPPOSED TO HANG ABOUT THEM ALL BUT THEY FORMED A PLEASANT LITTLE CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN LESS EXCLUSIVE THAN MOST CLIQUES
IT IS REALLY A CASE LAURA IS ENGAGED TO MISTER DALZELL YOUR OLD FRIEND AND NEIGHBOUR AND SHE IS GOING TO GIVE ONE OF HER WEDDING ORDERS HERE MISSUS DUNN SHOULD BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WE NEVER
AND PARDON FOR EVERY THING SAID OR DONE DURING THAT TIME AND THIS HE FAITHFULLY OBSERVED WITH THE EXCEPTION ONLY OF PUTTING TO DEATH A FEW TRIBUNES AND CENTURIONS CONCERNED IN THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST CAIUS BOTH AS AN EXAMPLE
BUT OBLIGED EACH MAN TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF IN THE BEST WAY HE COULD HE DISGRACED MANY AND SOME THAT LITTLE EXPECTED IT AND FOR A REASON ENTIRELY NEW
NOT ONLY BY INDIVIDUALS SEPARATELY BUT BY A FACTION
HE WAS SPARING AND MODEST DECLINING THE TITLE OF EMPEROR AND REFUSING ALL EXCESSIVE HONOURS HE CELEBRATED THE MARRIAGE OF HIS DAUGHTER
AGAINST THOSE WHO DID NOT WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER THEIR ABSENCE WAS OCCASIONED BY THEIR OWN FAULT OR BY REAL NECESSITY ON PROCLAMATION OF A MAN'S BEING CONVICTED OF FORGERY AND THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE HIS HAND CUT OFF HE INSISTED
IF I AM NOT ASTONISHED THAT THE DECLAMATION OF YOUR GRANDSON TIBERIUS SHOULD PLEASE ME FOR HOW HE WHO TALKS SO ILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECLAIM SO CLEARLY AND PROPERLY I CANNOT IMAGINE
GOT UP IN HASTE AND WITHOUT CEREMONY NOR DID HE LEND HIMSELF TO ANY KIND OF PUBLIC DIVERSION WITH MORE FREEDOM AND HILARITY INSOMUCH THAT HE WOULD HOLD OUT HIS LEFT HAND
OF OUR LORD'S INCARNATION AND IN THE TWENTY FOURTH YEAR OF MERVIN
THOSE WHOM HE CHARGED WITH LIVING IN CELIBACY WITH WANT OF CHILDREN OR ESTATE PROVING THEMSELVES TO BE HUSBANDS PARENTS AND IN AFFLUENT CIRCUMSTANCES ONE OF THE KNIGHTS WHO WAS CHARGED WITH STABBING HIMSELF LAID HIS BOSOM BARE
FOR SAID HE HIS FATHER IS HIS PROPER CENSOR
DECLARING BY A PROCLAMATION THAT HE THE MORE EARNESTLY INSISTED UPON THE OBSERVATION OF HIS FATHER DRUSUS'S BIRTH DAY BECAUSE IT WAS LIKEWISE THAT OF HIS GRANDFATHER ANTONY
HE LIKEWISE OFTEN DECLARED THAT HE WOULD SOME TIME OR OTHER IF POSSIBLE RESTORE THE ANCIENT GOVERNMENT IN THIS ACCOUNT I SUPPOSE SOME HAVE VENTURED TO AFFIRM THAT AUGUSTUS WAS JEALOUS OF HIM AND RECALLED HIM
AND SALUTED HIM BY THE TITLE OF EMPEROR HE THEN CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS WHO WERE ALL IN A GREAT RAGE AND IRRESOLUTE WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THEY PUT HIM INTO A LITTER AND AS THE SLAVES OF THE PALACE HAD ALL FLED
AND DURING ALMOST THE WHOLE OF HIS MINORITY AND FOR SOME TIME AFTER
NERO AND DRUSUS HE WAS VERY NEAR BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS OFFICE AND AFTERWARDS HE WAS CONTINUALLY HARASSED WITH INFORMATIONS AGAINST HIM BY ONE OR OTHER
FOR IT IS BETTER TO DRINK A WHOLESOME DRAUGHT OF TRUTH FROM THE HUMBLE VESSEL
AND BELIEVED TO BE TRUE THAT IN A PARTICULAR CAUSE HE DELIVERED HIS SENTENCE IN WRITING THUS
TO GAMES WHICH NO PERSON HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN NOR EVER WOULD AGAIN WHEN MANY WERE STILL LIVING WHO HAD ALREADY SEEN THEM
BUT NEVER FINISHED BY NATURE AND WHEN SHE WOULD UPBRAID ANY ONE WITH DULNESS SHE SAID HE WAS A GREATER FOOL THAN HER SON CLAUDIUS HIS GRANDMOTHER AUGUSTA ALWAYS TREATED HIM WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT
WHICH IS READY ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCH THINGS THE SUBJECT OF MIRTH AND DERISION
AS ONE OF THEIR ASSESSORS AND WHEN THEY GAVE PUBLIC SPECTACLES HE WOULD RISE UP WITH THE REST OF THE SPECTATORS AND SALUTE THEM BOTH BY WORDS AND GESTURES
THOUGH HE HIMSELF SAYS IN HIS HISTORY THAT THEY HAD BEEN OMITTED BEFORE THE AGE OF AUGUSTUS WHO HAD CALCULATED THE YEARS WITH GREAT EXACTNESS
HE CONSTANTLY ATTENDED THE COURTS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE EVEN UPON SUCH DAYS AS WERE SOLEMNLY OBSERVED AS DAYS OF REJOICING IN HIS FAMILY OR BY HIS FRIENDS
HE WOULD GIVE THEM ONE WHEN HE COULD CATCH IT THE FOLLOWING WAS WELL INTENDED AND WELL TIMED HAVING AMIDST GREAT APPLAUSE SPARED A GLADIATOR ON THE INTERCESSION OF HIS FOUR SONS HE SENT A BILLET IMMEDIATELY ROUND THE THEATRE
THAT HE WAS EVERYWHERE AND OPENLY DESPISED A PERSON MAKING AN EXCUSE
FOR IF HE BE CAPABLE OF ATTENDING HIS BROTHER TO THE MOUNT
A REPORT WAS SPREAD IN THE CITY THAT HE HAD BEEN WAY LAID AND SLAIN THE PEOPLE NEVER CEASED CURSING THE SOLDIERS FOR TRAITORS AND THE SENATE AS PARRICIDES UNTIL ONE OR TWO PERSONS AND PRESENTLY AFTER SEVERAL OTHERS WERE BROUGHT BY THE MAGISTRATES UPON THE ROSTRA
HE CONSIDERED AS BENEATH THE IMPERIAL DIGNITY
BUT EVEN TO SOME OF THE EXILES AMONG THE SPOILS TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY HE FIXED UPON THE PEDIMENT OF HIS HOUSE IN THE PALATIUM A NAVAL CROWN IN TOKEN OF HIS HAVING PASSED AND AS IT WERE CONQUERED THE OCEAN
THE COMPANY USED TO THROW OLIVE STONES AND DATES AT HIM AND THE BUFFOONS WHO ATTENDED WOULD WAKE HIM
AND FROM OUR ANCIENT TRADITIONS MANY TEACHERS AND SCRIBES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE THIS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAVE ABANDONED IT FROM ITS DIFFICULTY
BY WHICH MEANS BESIDES HIS FORMER CHARACTER OF A DULL HEAVY FELLOW HE ACQUIRED THAT OF A DRUNKARD
BY CARRYING OUT CIRCULAR PIERS ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT
AND WAS REBUILT BY HIM HE PRESIDED UPON A TRIBUNAL ERECTED FOR HIM IN THE ORCHESTRA HAVING FIRST PAID HIS DEVOTIONS IN THE TEMPLE ABOVE
HE HAD SENT FOR FROM THE PROVINCES DECLARED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO APPEAR CONCEALING THE REASON FOR SOME TIME AT LAST AFTER SEVERAL INTERROGATORIES WERE PUT TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT HE ANSWERED THE MAN IS DEAD TO WHICH CLAUDIUS REPLIED
NINE MONTHS FOR COMMON BIRTHS THE FATES DECREE
HE SOMETIMES PRESIDED AT THE PUBLIC SPECTACLES AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF CAIUS
A LOW FELLOW WAS FOUND WITH A PONIARD ABOUT HIM NEAR HIS CHAMBER AT MIDNIGHT TWO MEN OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER WERE DISCOVERED WAITING FOR HIM IN THE STREETS ARMED WITH A TUCK AND A HUNTSMAN'S DAGGER ONE OF THEM INTENDING TO ATTACK HIM AS HE CAME OUT OF THE THEATRE
YET HE FORBAD THE DAY OF HIS ASSASSINATION NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS THAT OF HIS OWN ACCESSION TO THE EMPIRE
I AM NOT AGAINST HIS SUPERINTENDING THE FEAST OF THE PRIESTS IN THE GAMES OF MARS IF HE WILL SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE GOVERNED BY HIS KINSMAN SILANUS'S SON THAT HE MAY DO NOTHING TO MAKE THE PEOPLE STARE AND LAUGH AT HIM
HE PRESIDED MUFFLED UP IN A PALLIUM A NEW FASHION WHEN HE ASSUMED THE MANLY HABIT HE WAS CARRIED IN A LITTER AT MIDNIGHT TO THE CAPITOL
THEN MUSO TOLD OF THE DIM AND AWFUL SHAPE THAT HAD ENTERED THE DEATH CHAMBER TO DEVOUR THE BODY AND THE OFFERINGS NO PERSON SEEMED TO BE SURPRISED BY HIS NARRATION AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OBSERVED
I THOUGHT ONLY OF THE FOOD AND THE CLOTHES THAT MY SACRED PROFESSION ENABLED ME TO GAIN AND BECAUSE OF THIS SELFISH IMPIETY I WAS REBORN IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DEATH INTO THE STATE OF A JIKININKI
THE PRIEST WHO YESTERDAY EVENING DIRECTED ME TO THIS VILLAGE ANSWERED MUSO I CALLED AT HIS ANJITSU ON THE HILL YONDER HE REFUSED ME LODGING BUT TOLD ME THE WAY HERE THE LISTENERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS IN ASTONISHMENT
THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
TURNED TO THE OFFERINGS AND ATE THEM ALSO THEN IT WENT AWAY AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS IT HAD COME WHEN THE VILLAGERS RETURNED NEXT MORNING THEY FOUND THE PRIEST AWAITING THEM AT THE DOOR OF THE HEADMAN'S DWELLING ALL IN TURN SALUTED HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED
BUT I AM SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT TELL ME OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH WHEN I CAME FOR THOUGH I WAS A LITTLE TIRED I CERTAINLY WAS NOT SO TIRED THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND DIFFICULTY IN DOING MY DUTY AS A PRIEST HAD YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE PERFORMED THE SERVICE BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
BUT THE BELL PROVED TO BE A GOOD BELL AND IT BRAVELY WITHSTOOD THEIR ASSAULTS NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED DAY AFTER DAY AT ALL HOURS THEY CONTINUED TO RING THE BELL FURIOUSLY CARING NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE PROTESTS OF THE PRIESTS
HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
OR BELL OF MUGEN NOW THERE ARE QUEER OLD JAPANESE BELIEFS IN THE MAGICAL EFFICACY OF A CERTAIN MENTAL OPERATION IMPLIED THOUGH NOT DESCRIBED BY THE VERB
BUT A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE WAS ROUSED FROM SLEEP BY A SOUND OF LOUD WEEPING IN THE NEXT APARTMENT PRESENTLY THE SLIDING SCREENS WERE GENTLY PUSHED APART AND A YOUNG MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED LANTERN ENTERED THE ROOM RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID
AND PRESENTLY DIE NOW IF THESE BE ROKURO KUBI THEY MEAN ME NO GOOD SO I SHALL BE JUSTIFIED IN FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE BOOK HE SEIZED THE BODY OF THE ARUJI BY THE FEET PULLED IT TO THE WINDOW AND PUSHED IT OUT
AS IT IS I SHALL PERFORM THE SERVICE AFTER YOU HAVE GONE AWAY AND I SHALL STAY BY THE BODY UNTIL MORNING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY YOUR WORDS ABOUT THE DANGER OF STAYING HERE ALONE
SO HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND HAVING FOUND A SUITABLE GRASSY SPOT BY THE ROADSIDE HE LAY DOWN THERE AND PREPARED TO SLEEP
PRESENTLY THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI STOPPED EATING AND SAID AH THAT TRAVELING PRIEST WHO CAME TO NIGHT HOW FAT ALL HIS BODY IS WHEN WE SHALL HAVE EATEN HIM OUR BELLIES WILL BE WELL FILLED I WAS FOOLISH TO TALK TO HIM AS I DID
TO GO NEAR HIM WHILE HE IS RECITING WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND WE CANNOT TOUCH HIM SO LONG AS HE IS PRAYING BUT AS IT IS NOW NEARLY MORNING PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP SOME ONE OF YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE WHAT THE FELLOW IS DOING
AND THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHBORING CASCADE DEEPENED WITH THE NIGHT KWAIRYO FELT THIRSTY AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE OF THE WATER AND REMEMBERING THE BAMBOO AQUEDUCT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GO THERE AND GET A DRINK WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
WHILE THE PAIR WERE TRAVELING TOGETHER KAJIWARA ONE DAY FOUND HIMSELF IN GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF MONEY AND UMEGAE REMEMBERING THE TRADITION OF THE BELL OF MUGEN TOOK A BASIN OF BRONZE AND MENTALLY REPRESENTING IT TO BE THE BELL BEAT UPON IT UNTIL SHE BROKE IT
AS IT DESERVES TO BE ANSWERED TAKE THEREFORE THIS JAR SO SAYING SHE PUT THE JAR INTO HIS HANDS AND DISAPPEARED INTO HIS HOUSE THE HAPPY MAN RUSHED TO TELL HIS WIFE THE GOOD NEWS HE SET DOWN IN FRONT OF HER THE COVERED JAR WHICH WAS HEAVY
SO MUCH WILL PERHAPS SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN THE RELIGIOUS MEANINGS OF NAZORAERU THE MAGICAL MEANINGS COULD NOT ALL BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT A GREAT VARIETY OF EXAMPLES BUT FOR PRESENT PURPOSES THE FOLLOWING WILL SERVE IF YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE MAN OF STRAW
ON THE CONTRARY THE LINE OF LEVERANCE WAS SMOOTH AS THE LINE AT WHICH A FALLING LEAF DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE STEM THEN SAID THE ELDER I AM QUITE SURE THAT THE PRIEST TOLD US NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THIS IS THE HEAD OF A ROKURO KUBI
AND TO LEAVE THE CORPSE ALONE WHENEVER THIS LAW HAS BEEN BROKEN HERETOFORE SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE HAS FOLLOWED WHENEVER IT IS OBEYED WE FIND THAT THE CORPSE AND THE OFFERINGS DISAPPEAR DURING OUR ABSENCE PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN THE CAUSE
SO AFTER HAVING PASSED A NIGHT IN PRISON HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE DISTRICT THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO EXPLAIN HOW HE A PRIEST HAD BEEN FOUND WITH THE HEAD OF A MAN FASTENED TO HIS SLEEVE AND WHY HE HAD DARED THUS SHAMELESSLY TO PARADE HIS CRIME IN THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE
TO NIGHT I SHALL RECITE THE SUTRAS FOR YOUR SAKE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE FORCE TO OVERCOME THE KARMA OF ANY PAST ERRORS WITH THESE ASSURANCES KWAIRYO BADE THE ARUJI GOOD NIGHT AND HIS HOST SHOWED HIM TO A VERY SMALL SIDE ROOM WHERE A BED HAD BEEN MADE READY
WHICH DELIGHTED HER BABY EYES WHEN HER MOTHER FIRST SHOWED HER THE MIRROR SHE LONGED FOR SOME CHANCE TO STEAL THE MIRROR AND HIDE IT THAT SHE MIGHT THEREAFTER TREASURE IT ALWAYS BUT THE CHANCE DID NOT COME AND SHE BECAME VERY UNHAPPY FELT AS IF SHE HAD FOOLISHLY GIVEN AWAY A PART OF HER LIFE
HELP ME BY YOUR PRAYERS I ENTREAT YOU SO THAT I MAY BE SOON ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HORRIBLE STATE OF EXISTENCE NO SOONER HAD THE HERMIT UTTERED THIS PETITION THAN HE DISAPPEARED AND THE HERMITAGE ALSO DISAPPEARED AT THE SAME INSTANT
FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
WE WERE TALKING TO HIM ABOUT YOU A FEW DAYS AGO KOCHUBEY CONTINUED AND ABOUT YOUR FREED PLOWMEN
OF THE GREAT EMPEROR NAPOLEON NOT HARMFUL BUT HELPFUL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE SERVICE
WERE TAKING SHAPE AND BEING REALIZED
BUT WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN OF GENIUS SPERANSKI AND THIS MOVEMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION OF WHICH PRINCE ANDREW HAD A VAGUE IDEA AND SPERANSKI ITS CHIEF PROMOTER
RETURNED PRINCE ANDREW QUIETLY ARAKCHEEV'S EYES TURNED TOWARD HIM SIT DOWN SAID HE
MON CHER
AS HE HAD BEEN DETAINED AT THE PALACE HE DID NOT SAY THAT THE EMPEROR HAD KEPT HIM AND PRINCE ANDREW NOTICED THIS AFFECTATION OF MODESTY
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF HIS FATHER THE FEMININE SOCIETY WORLD WELCOMED HIM GLADLY BECAUSE HE WAS RICH DISTINGUISHED A GOOD MATCH AND ALMOST A NEWCOMER
THE FACES OF THOSE OF HIGHER RANK EXPRESSED A COMMON FEELING OF AWKWARDNESS COVERED BY A MASK OF UNCONCERN AND RIDICULE OF THEMSELVES THEIR SITUATION AND THE PERSON FOR WHOM THEY WERE WAITING SOME WALKED THOUGHTFULLY UP AND DOWN OTHERS WHISPERED AND LAUGHED
IT WAS SPERANSKI PRINCE ANDREW RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AND FELT A THROB WITHIN HIM AS HAPPENS AT CRITICAL MOMENTS OF LIFE
PARTICULARLY THOSE HE KNEW TO BE IN POWER AND WHOSE AID HE MIGHT NEED IN PETERSBURG HE NOW EXPERIENCED THE SAME FEELING HE HAD HAD ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE
AND WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO PUT INTO EFFECT WITH THE AID OF HIS ASSOCIATES CZARTORYSKI NOVOSILTSEV
OUR FREEMASONS KNEW FROM CORRESPONDENCE WITH THOSE ABROAD THAT BEZUKHOV HAD OBTAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF MANY HIGHLY PLACED PERSONS
AND MUST ENDEAVOR TO SECURE THAT THE HONEST MAN MAY EVEN IN THIS WORLD RECEIVE A LASTING REWARD FOR HIS VIRTUE BUT IN THESE GREAT ENDEAVORS WE ARE GRAVELY HAMPERED BY THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF TODAY
IF YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOR OF CALLING ON ME ON WEDNESDAY HE ADDED I WILL AFTER TALKING WITH MAGNITSKI LET YOU KNOW WHAT MAY INTEREST YOU AND SHALL ALSO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF A MORE DETAILED CHAT WITH YOU
AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO REGARD THEM MERELY AS BROTHERS IN FREEMASONRY AND NOT AS PRINCE B OR IVAN VASILEVICH D WHOM HE KNEW IN SOCIETY MOSTLY AS WEAK AND INSIGNIFICANT MEN
FOR IT QUITE FAILS TO REMEDY EVIL WHILE MEN REMAIN WHAT THEY ARE AND ALSO BECAUSE WISDOM NEEDS NO VIOLENCE THE WHOLE PLAN OF OUR ORDER SHOULD BE BASED ON THE IDEA OF PREPARING MEN OF FIRMNESS AND VIRTUE
ABOLISHING COURT RANKS AND INTRODUCING EXAMINATIONS TO QUALIFY FOR THE GRADES OF COLLEGIATE ASSESSOR AND STATE COUNCILOR AND NOT MERELY THESE BUT A WHOLE STATE CONSTITUTION INTENDED TO CHANGE THE EXISTING ORDER OF GOVERNMENT IN RUSSIA LEGAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL
DIFFUSE PRINCIPLES IN HARMONY WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG
BOLDLY YET PRUDENTLY OVERCOME SUPERSTITIONS INFIDELITY AND FOLLY AND FORM OF THOSE DEVOTED TO US A BODY LINKED TOGETHER BY UNITY OF PURPOSE AND POSSESSED OF AUTHORITY AND POWER
BOUND TOGETHER BY UNITY OF CONVICTION AIMING AT THE PUNISHMENT OF VICE AND FOLLY AND PATRONIZING TALENT AND VIRTUE RAISING WORTHY MEN FROM THE DUST AND ATTACHING THEM TO OUR BROTHERHOOD
WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOR REVOLUTIONS OVERTHROW EVERYTHING REPEL FORCE BY FORCE NO WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THAT EVERY VIOLENT REFORM DESERVES CENSURE
AS SOON AS WE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORTHY MEN IN EVERY STATE EACH OF THEM AGAIN TRAINING TWO OTHERS AND ALL BEING CLOSELY UNITED EVERYTHING WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR OUR ORDER WHICH HAS ALREADY IN SECRET ACCOMPLISHED MUCH FOR THE WELFARE OF MANKIND
THE PETERSBURG FREEMASONS ALL CAME TO SEE HIM TRIED TO INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH HIM AND IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL THAT HE WAS PREPARING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND CONCEALING IT A SOLEMN MEETING OF THE LODGE OF THE SECOND DEGREE WAS CONVENED
THIS OFFICER'S AUDIENCE LASTED A LONG TIME THEN SUDDENLY THE GRATING SOUND OF A HARSH VOICE WAS HEARD FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AND THE OFFICER WITH PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS CAME OUT AND PASSED THROUGH THE WAITING ROOM CLUTCHING HIS HEAD
IN THE BOG JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH WAS NOT IN PETERSBURG HE HAD OF LATE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE AFFAIRS OF THE PETERSBURG LODGES AND LIVED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN MOSCOW ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE LODGES WERE MEN PIERRE KNEW IN ORDINARY LIFE
ACROSS THE PAPER WAS SCRAWLED IN PENCIL WITHOUT CAPITAL LETTERS MISSPELLED AND WITHOUT PUNCTUATION UNSOUNDLY CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE RESEMBLES AN IMITATION OF THE FRENCH MILITARY CODE AND FROM THE ARTICLES OF WAR NEEDLESSLY DEVIATING
SPERANSKI'S WHOLE FIGURE WAS OF A PECULIAR TYPE THAT MADE HIM EASILY RECOGNIZABLE IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH PRINCE ANDREW LIVED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE WHO TOGETHER WITH AWKWARD AND CLUMSY GESTURES POSSESSED SUCH CALMNESS AND SELF ASSURANCE
IT WAS A SMALL ESTATE THAT BROUGHT IN NO PROFIT REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO EXTENUATE HIS ACTION SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE THE OLD MAN USELESSLY AFRAID OF BEING LATE SAID THE OLD MAN LOOKING AT KOCHUBEY
ABOVE OUR CONTEMPORARIES WHO SO CONDEMN THIS MEASURE WHICH MERELY REESTABLISHES NATURAL JUSTICE I THINK HOWEVER THAT THESE CONDEMNATIONS HAVE SOME GROUND RETURNED PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO RESIST
AND WAS TOLD THAT HIS TURN WOULD COME IN DUE COURSE AFTER SOME OTHERS HAD BEEN SHOWN IN AND OUT OF THE MINISTER'S ROOM BY THE ADJUTANT ON DUTY AN OFFICER WHO STRUCK PRINCE ANDREW BY HIS HUMILIATED AND FRIGHTENED AIR WAS ADMITTED AT THAT TERRIBLE DOOR
PIERRE RESPECTED THIS CLASS OF BROTHERS TO WHICH THE ELDER ONES CHIEFLY BELONGED INCLUDING PIERRE THOUGHT JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH HIMSELF
HE LIKED TO DINE AND DRINK WELL AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT IMMORAL AND HUMILIATING COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE BACHELOR CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVED AMID THE TURMOIL OF HIS ACTIVITIES AND DISTRACTIONS HOWEVER
NOT AN EASY TASK
HE THINKS I AM UNGRATEFUL AND IS OFFENDED SHE SAID TO HERSELF WELL I CAN BEAR COLDNESS BETTER THAN KINDNESS NOW AND IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GO KITTY WAS PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT OF REIGNING ALONE
HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT TO HER NOW HIS APPARENT CONTENTMENT WAS RESIGNATION HIS CHEERFULNESS A MANLY CONTEMPT FOR COMPLAINT HIS RESERVE THE MODEST RETICENCE
AS GEORGE MAC DONALD SOMEWHERE SAYS HER SOUL SEEMED TO SIT APART IN A SUNNY LITTLE ROOM SAFE FROM DUST AND NOISE SERENELY REGARDING PASSERS BY THROUGH THE CLEAR MUSLIN CURTAINS OF HER WINDOW
AND REJOICE AS NATURALLY AND BEAUTIFULLY AS FLOWERS IN THE SPRING A SOFT BRIGHTNESS SHONE IN HER EYES A FULLER TONE SOUNDED IN HER VOICE AND HER FACE GREW YOUNG AND BLOOMING
AND STRENGTHENED HER BY THE MUTE ELOQUENCE OF SYMPATHY THIS MADE THE HARDEST TASK OF ALL EASIER TO PERFORM
ONE EVENING SHE SAT STUDYING FERNS AND HEROICALLY SAYING OVER AND OVER ANDIANTUM ASPIDIUM AND ASPLENIUM
OR THE LIGHTER TASKS FITTED FOR FEEBLE HANDS CHRISTIE OFTEN CALLED HER MOTHER AND FELT HERSELF REWARDED FOR THE HARDEST HUMBLEST JOB SHE EVER DID WHEN THE SWEET OLD VOICE SAID GRATEFULLY
AND PRESERVED AN EXQUISITE NEATNESS EVERYWHERE WHICH DELIGHTED THE SOUL OF THE ROOM'S ORDER LOVING OCCUPANT SHE ALSO ALAS FOR ROMANCE COOKED THE DISHES DAVID LOVED
AND YOU WON'T MAKE ME WILL YOU KITTY ROSE AS SHE SPOKE AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A BESEECHING LITTLE GESTURE AND A CONFIDING AIR QUITE CAPTIVATING TO BEHOLD
IT MAY NOT BE EASY BUT ALL THE SACRIFICES SHALL NOT BE HIS AND I WON'T BE A FOOL WITH PRAISEWORTHY RESOLUTION CHRISTIE SET ABOUT THE REFORMATION WITHOUT DELAY
BUT HE FOUND IT SO EASY AND PLEASANT TO BE A FRIEND THAT HE REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT TRYING IT BEFORE AND EXPLAINED HIS NEGLECT BY THE FACT THAT CHRISTIE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY WOMAN
ARMED WITH THIS RESOLUTION CHRISTIE WENT THE NEXT DAY TO MISTER POWER AND SIMPLY SAID I AM NOT NEEDED AT THE STERLINGS ANY MORE CAN YOU GIVE ME OTHER WORK TO DO MISTER POWER'S KEEN EYE SEARCHED HER FACE FOR A MOMENT
THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN NODDED TO EACH OTHER TOOK A SWIFT SURVEY AND MADE UP THEIR MINDS BEFORE DAVID HAD POKED THE FIRE CHRISTIE SAW A PRETTY FACE WITH ROSY CHEEKS BLUE EYES
FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR DAVID'S LEARNING SHE COVERED THE IRRUPTIVE SOFA NEATLY SAW THAT THE LITTLE VASE WAS ALWAYS CLEAR AND FRESHLY FILLED CARED FOR THE NURSERY IN THE GABLE WINDOW
LOVE HER FRIENDS MORE THAN EVER AND DO ANY THING GREAT GOOD OR GLORIOUS SHE HAD KNOWN SUCH MOODS BEFORE BUT THEY HAD NEVER LASTED LONG AND WERE NOT SO INTENSE AS THIS
SHE ALSO EXAGGERATED THEM AND COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO SHOW THE DAILY INCREASING ESTEEM AND RESPECT SHE FELT FOR HIM AND TO ATONE FOR THE INJUSTICE SHE ONCE DID HIM SHE GRUBBED IN THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE
AND BROWN RINGS OF HAIR LYING ON THE SMOOTH LOW FOREHEAD A YOUNG FACE BUT NOT CHILDLIKE FOR IT WAS CONSCIOUS OF ITS OWN PRETTINESS AND BETRAYED THE FACT BY LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES THAT REMINDED ONE OF A COQUETTISH KITTEN
AND LET NO DUST OBSCURE THEIR WELL BELOVED FACES SHE SET THE BOOKS IN ORDER DAILY TAKING MANY A SIP OF REFRESHMENT FROM THEM BY THE WAY AND RESPECTFULLY REGARDED THOSE IN UNKNOWN TONGUES
YOU'D BETTER THINK AGAIN BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND HE IS RESPECTABLE WELL OFF AND FOND OF YOU IT SEEMS WHY NOT TRY IT KITTY YOU NEED SOME ONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SADLY
IF I GET THROUGH THIS PARTING WITHOUT DISGRACING MYSELF I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME AFTERWARD SHE SAID AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT DO SO SHE ASSUMED A CHEERFUL AIR
AND DID NOT DISGUISE HER SATISFACTION SO CHRISTIE'S LAST DAY WAS ANY THING BUT PLEASANT MISTER POWER WOULD SEND FOR HER ON THE MORROW AND SHE BUSIED HERSELF IN PACKING HER OWN POSSESSIONS SETTING EVERY THING IN ORDER
FOR YOU ARE ONLY A CHILD AFTER ALL LET THE LOVERS GO AND STAY AND PLAY WITH ME FOR I'VE BEEN RATHER LONELY LATELY THAT'S A REPROACH FOR ME THOUGHT CHRISTIE LONGING TO CRY OUT
CHRISTIE HAD WON HER HEART LONG AGO AND NOW WAS AS DEVOTED AS A DAUGHTER TO HER LIGHTENING HER CARES SO SKILFULLY THAT MANY OF THEM SLIPPED NATURALLY ON TO THE YOUNG SHOULDERS AND LEFT THE OLD LADY MUCH TIME FOR REST
HERE KITTY CAME RUNNING IN FROM THE GREEN HOUSE WITH HER HANDS FULL OF FLOWERS AND PASSING CHRISTIE WHO WAS FUMBLING AMONG THE CLOAKS IN THE PASSAGE SHE WENT TO SHOW DAVID SOME NEW BLOSSOM
A THOUSAND LITTLE COQUETRIES WERE PLAYED OFF FOR HIS BENEFIT AND FREQUENT APPEALS FOR ADVICE IN HER HEART AFFAIRS KEPT TENDER SUBJECTS UPPERMOST IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS
BUT AS CHRISTIE BADE HER GOOD NIGHT SHE HELD HER HAND SAYING WITH A KISS NO ONE WILL TAKE THY PLACE WITH ME MY DAUGHTER
THEE IS A GOOD GARDENER DAVY THE OLD LADY WOULD REPLY AND WHEN HE WAS BUSY WOULD WATCH HIM WITH A TENDER SORT OF ANXIETY AS IF TO DISCOVER A LIKE CHANGE IN HIM
SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
THE BICYCLE EXPLAINS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MURDERER'S BIG FOOT PRINTS I SAID THE MURDERER WITH HIS ROUGH BOOTS MOUNTED A BICYCLE HIS ACCOMPLICE THE WEARER OF THE NEAT BOOTS HAD COME TO WAIT FOR HIM ON THE EDGE OF THE LAKE WITH THE BICYCLE
THE GREEN MAN GROWLED THE INNKEEPER DON'T YOU KNOW HIM THEN ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU HE IS NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE TO MAKE WELL HE IS MONSIEUR STANGERSON'S FOREST KEEPER
IF WE HAD A BICYCLE HERE WE MIGHT DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REASONING MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE HANDKERCHIEF FULL OF BLOOD AND THE RED MARK OF THE HAND ON THE WALL YOU HAVE SEEN THE STAIN ON THE WALL BUT I HAVE ONLY SEEN THE HANDKERCHIEF BAH CRIED ROULETABILLE THE MURDERER WAS WOUNDED IN THE HAND BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S REVOLVER AH
A GLASS OF CIDER DADDY MATHIEU HE SAID AS THE GREEN MAN ENTERED DADDY MATHIEU HAD STARTED VIOLENTLY BUT VISIBLY MASTERING HIMSELF HE SAID I'VE NO MORE CIDER I SERVED THE LAST BOTTLES TO THESE GENTLEMEN
MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THEY WERE FIXED ON MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS FEET SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEGANT FOOTMARKS THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF THERE AND TOOK OFF HIS HOBNAILED BOOTS WHICH HE HAD WORN ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MISLEADING DETECTION AND THEN NO DOUBT TAKING THEM AWAY WITH HIM HE STOOD UP IN HIS OWN BOOTS AND QUIETLY AND SLOWLY REGAINED THE HIGH ROAD
I'VE NOTHING FOR YOU NOTHING FOR YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE GREEN MAN QUIETLY REFILLED HIS PIPE LIT IT BOWED TO US AND WENT OUT
AS WE EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FURNISH US WITH A BREAKFAST HE ASSURED US THAT HE HAD NO PROVISIONS REGARDING US AS HE SAID THIS WITH A LOOK THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY SUSPICIOUS
AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF I DID NOT DETECT AN EVIL SMILE ON HIS LIPS AT THAT MOMENT THE NOISE OF LOUD QUARRELLING REACHED US WE EVEN THOUGHT WE HEARD A DULL SOUND OF BLOWS AS IF SOME ONE WAS BEING BEATEN
FRED IMPERTURBABLE INTERRUPTED HIM DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE EXAMINATION OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ROUND SCARLET STAINS THE IMPRESSION OF DROPS WHICH I FOUND IN THE TRACKS OF THE FOOTPRINTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE MADE ON THE FLOOR
AND SAID HE WAS SURE OF THE CHAMBERMAID'S FIDELITY AND THAT SHE WAS A THOROUGHLY HONEST AND DEVOTED SERVANT BESIDES HE ADDED AT FIVE O'CLOCK MONSIEUR STANGERSON WENT INTO THE ROOM TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER'S HAT THERE IS THAT ALSO SAID ROULETABILLE
THEN GIVE ME A GLASS OF WHITE WINE SAID THE GREEN MAN WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE I'VE NO MORE WHITE WINE NO MORE ANYTHING SAID DADDY MATHIEU SURLILY HOW IS MADAME MATHIEU QUITE WELL THANK YOU
UNDER ITS SIGN BOARD OVER THE THRESHOLD A MAN WITH A CRABBED LOOKING FACE WAS STANDING SEEMINGLY PLUNGED IN UNPLEASANT THOUGHT IF THE WRINKLES ON HIS FOREHEAD AND THE KNITTING OF HIS BROWS WERE ANY INDICATION
PROVE THAT HE ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE ONE STRIDE TO FIND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE VESTIBULE WINDOW LEFT OPEN BY DADDY JACQUES THE MAN DREW HIMSELF UP BY HIS HANDS AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE AFTER ALL IT IS VERY POSSIBLE
WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT MORNING WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACROBAT HE GOT INTO THE LODGE BY AN UPPER WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND RETURNED TEN MINUTES LATER HE SAID ONLY AH A WORD WHICH IN HIS MOUTH
IT WAS A MORNING IN WHICH THE APPROACH OF WINTER WAS UNMISTAKABLE THE ROOM WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE ONE FURNISHED WITH TWO HEAVY TABLES SOME STOOLS A COUNTER DECORATED WITH ROWS OF BOTTLES OF SYRUP AND ALCOHOL
WHICH HE AT ONCE STIFLED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT OUR ORDERS AS OBEDIENTLY AS MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HAD DONE
BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO SAY ON THIS AFFAIR IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS JUSTIFIED AND WHAT IS YOUR HYPOTHESIS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
AND APPLIED IT TO A VERY CLEAR FOOTMARK BEHIND THE THICKET AHA HE SAID RISING I THOUGHT HE WAS NOW GOING TO TRACE BACK THE TRACK OF THE MURDERER'S FOOTMARKS TO THE VESTIBULE WINDOW BUT HE LED US INSTEAD FAR TO THE LEFT SAYING THAT IT WAS USELESS FERRETING IN THE MUD
WE ARE NOT POLICEMEN I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE REPLIED THE MAN I HAD MADE MY FRIEND UNDERSTAND BY A SIGN THAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER NOT TO INSIST BUT BEING DETERMINED TO ENTER THE INN
THEIR INTELLIGENCE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ABOUT THE SAME RESULT IF NATURE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FURNISH THEIR BRAIN PAN WITH A LITTLE GREY MATTER AS I APPEARED VEXED MY YOUNG FRIEND TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT FOR ME HE THOUGHT MORE OF ME THAN THAT
WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW THE DONJON INN WAS OF NO IMPOSING APPEARANCE BUT I LIKE THESE BUILDINGS WITH THEIR RAFTERS BLACKENED WITH AGE AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR HEARTHS THESE INNS OF THE COACHING DAYS CRUMBLING ERECTIONS THAT WILL SOON EXIST IN THE MEMORY ONLY
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I ASKED SINCE THESE FOOTMARKS ARE NOT CONTINUED ON THE PATH WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHY THESE FOOTPRINTS WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND HE CRIED POINTING TO THE SHARPLY OUTLINED IMPRINT OF A NEAT BOOT SEE
BUT HE WALKED ON THE GRAVEL WHICH LEFT NO IMPRESSION OF HIS TREAD THE GRAVEL HAS IN FACT BEEN TRODDEN BY MANY OTHER FEET SINCE THE PATH IS THE MOST DIRECT WAY BETWEEN THE PAVILION AND THE CHATEAU AS TO THE THICKET
AND LAUGHING A LITTLE IN A SLIGHTLY BANTERING TONE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
NO SOONER WAS HE OVER THE THRESHOLD THAN DADDY MATHIEU SLAMMED THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND TURNING TOWARDS US WITH EYES BLOODSHOT AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH HE HISSED TO US SHAKING HIS CLENCHED FIST AT THE DOOR HE HAD JUST SHUT ON THE MAN HE EVIDENTLY HATED
HENCE SUCH A WAY OF RECEIVING IS NOT THAT OF MATTER BUT OF AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE
AND NOT AS IF HE WERE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY AND SOMETIMES POTENTIALLY AS WE ARE HENCE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTION RESTS ON AN EQUIVOCATION
FIRSTLY THE PURELY SPIRITUAL CREATURE WHICH IN HOLY SCRIPTURE IS CALLED ANGEL SECONDLY THE CREATURE WHOLLY CORPOREAL THIRDLY THE COMPOSITE CREATURE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL WHICH IS MAN
BUT THINGS DISTINGUISHED BY THE INTELLECT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DISTINGUISHED IN REALITY BECAUSE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT APPREHEND THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR MODE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN MODE HENCE
OPERATION AS APPEARS FROM ITS OBJECT WHENCE ANY ACT RECEIVES ITS SPECIES AND NATURE FOR A THING IS UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO ITS DEGREE OF IMMATERIALITY BECAUSE FORMS THAT EXIST IN MATTER
ARE NOT RECEIVED IN ANYTHING ELSE AS IF WE WERE TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHITENESS EXISTING SEPARATE IS INFINITE AS REGARDS THE NATURE OF WHITENESS FORASMUCH
IS AKIN TO THAT OF AERIAL BODIES BUT THE NATURE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS IS THE SAME THEREFORE ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
FORM IS PROPERLY LIMITED AND PERFECTED BY MATTER SO THE FORM WHICH IS NOT IN MATTER IS AN INFINITE FORM BUT THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS NOT INFINITE FOR EVERY CREATURE IS FINITE
AND OTHER POWERS BY THE OTHER MEMBERS
THE MORE A THING APPROACHES TO UNITY SO MUCH THE LESS IS IT MULTIPLIED AS IS EVIDENT IN NUMBERS BUT AMONG OTHER CREATED NATURES THE ANGELIC NATURE APPROACHES NEAREST TO GOD THEREFORE SINCE GOD IS SUPREMELY ONE
THAT ALL THE ANGELS OF ONE HIERARCHY OR EVEN OF ONE ORDER ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH THINGS AS AGREE IN SPECIES BUT DIFFER IN NUMBER AGREE IN FORM
CONCERNING THE ANGELS WE CONSIDER FIRST WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR SUBSTANCE SECONDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR INTELLECT THIRDLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR WILL FOURTHLY WHAT BELONGS TO THEIR CREATION
THEREFORE EVERY CREATURE IS CORPOREAL NOW ANGELS ARE GOD'S CREATURES AS APPEARS
IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN ANGEL IS NOT ENTIRELY INCORPOREAL FOR WHAT IS INCORPOREAL ONLY AS REGARDS OURSELVES AND NOT
MOVEMENT COMING FROM A UNITED MOVER IS A PROPER FUNCTION OF LIFE BUT THE BODIES ASSUMED BY THE ANGELS ARE NOT THUS MOVED SINCE THE ANGELS ARE NOT THEIR FORMS YET THE ANGELS ARE MOVED ACCIDENTALLY WHEN SUCH BODIES ARE MOVED
AND THEREFORE IN THEM GENUS AND DIFFERENCE ARE NOT DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT THINGS BUT FROM ONE AND THE SAME NEVERTHELESS THIS DIFFERS IN OUR MODE OF CONCEPTION FOR INASMUCH AS OUR INTELLECT CONSIDERS IT
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REALLY NOT FOR THE BODIES ARE ASSUMED MERELY FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT THE SPIRITUAL PROPERTIES AND WORKS OF THE ANGELS MAY BE MANIFESTED BY THE PROPERTIES OF MAN AND OF HIS WORKS
THEIR SUBSTANCE WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY AND IN RELATION TO CORPOREAL THINGS CONCERNING THEIR SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED
BEING ABOVE TIME IS EVERLASTING HENCE EVERY INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE IS INCORRUPTIBLE OF ITS OWN NATURE
CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY WHEN THE FORM IS SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER BUT IF THE FORM SUBSISTS IN ITS OWN BEING AS HAPPENS
IN VIEW OF WHICH IT BELONGED TO IT ROUNDNESS CAN NEVER BE TAKEN FROM THE CIRCLE BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO IT OF ITSELF BUT A BRONZE CIRCLE CAN LOSE ROUNDNESS IF THE BRONZE BE DEPRIVED OF ITS CIRCULAR SHAPE NOW TO BE
IT IS NOT SAID TO BE ASSUMED OTHERWISE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL BODIES MOVED BY THE ANGELS ARE ASSUMED BY THEM THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
THAT SOME HAVE SAID THAT ALL SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCES EVEN SOULS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES OTHERS AGAIN THAT ALL THE ANGELS ARE OF THE ONE SPECIES BUT NOT SOULS WHILE OTHERS ALLEGE
WHICH CONTAIN A TWOFOLD COMPOSITION THE FIRST IS THAT OF FORM AND MATTER WHEREBY THE NATURE IS CONSTITUTED SUCH A COMPOSITE NATURE IS NOT ITS OWN EXISTENCE BUT EXISTENCE IS ITS ACT
THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
WERE ORDAINED TO THAT ONE WHEREBY THE SON OF GOD APPEARED IN THE FLESH
THAT THE MULTIPLICATION OF INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES CAN ONLY BE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRST BODIES THAT IS OF THE HEAVENLY ONES SO THAT IN SOME WAY THE SHEDDING FORM OF THE AFORESAID RAYS
INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT THE ANGELS HAVE NOT BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM FOR WHATEVER BELONGS TO ANY NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT
BUT ARE DISTINGUISHED MATERIALLY IF THEREFORE THE ANGELS
HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE USE OF THIS ARGUMENT SINCE ONLY THROUGH SENSIBLE THINGS CAN WE COME TO KNOW
WOULD BE CORPOREAL AND SPIRITUAL HENCE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ONE PART OF MATTER RECEIVES THE CORPOREAL FORM AND ANOTHER RECEIVES THE SPIRITUAL FORM MATTER HOWEVER IS NOT DIVISIBLE INTO PARTS
AS IT IS SOUND AND WALKING AGREES WITH OTHER MOVEMENTS IN SO FAR AS IT IS MOVEMENT CONSEQUENTLY VITAL FUNCTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED IN ASSUMED BODIES BY THE ANGELS AS TO THAT WHICH IS COMMON IN SUCH OPERATIONS
AS INDETERMINATE IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR GENUS AND INASMUCH AS IT CONSIDERS IT DETERMINATELY IT DERIVES THE IDEA OF THEIR DIFFERENCE REPLY
THE BOAT IS WAITING FOR US COME BESIDES SAID ARAMIS WHAT PREVENTS OUR BEING DISTRUSTFUL AND GOING ABOARD AT THE SAME TIME
THIS MAN WAS CROMWELL CROMWELL HAD TWO OR THREE OF THESE RETREATS IN LONDON
D'ARTAGNAN FINDING A LANTERN ON THE DECK TOOK IT UP AND WITH A PISTOL IN HIS HAND HE SAID TO THE CAPTAIN IN ENGLISH COME BEING WITH THE CLASSIC ENGLISH OATH THE ONLY ENGLISH WORDS HE KNEW AND SO SAYING HE DESCENDED TO THE LOWER DECK
THE GENERAL REMEMBERED THAT I HAD FORMERLY BEEN A NAVAL OFFICER AND HE GAVE ME THE COMMAND OF THIS EXPEDITION IS THERE ANYTHING NEW IN THE WIND NOTHING
PITCH DARK WHEN ONE DOES NOT SEE MORE THAN TWENTY YARDS BEFORE ONE YES BUT TO MORROW MORNING TO MORROW WE SHALL BE AT BOULOGNE I HOPE SO WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE GASCON AND I CONFESS MY WEAKNESS
AND IF HE DOESN'T GO STRAIGHT I WILL CRUSH HIM THAT'S ALL
FOR THEY WILL SOON BE HERE I AM READY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT NONE OF YOUR CREW SHOULD SEE ME I HAVE BUT ONE MAN ON BOARD AND I AM AS SURE OF HIM AS I AM OF MYSELF BESIDES HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU
AND HE INSTINCTIVELY SLIPPED IT AROUND WITHIN REACH OF HIS RIGHT HAND D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAITING FOR A REPLY TO HIS REMARK AND SAID NOTHING ARAMIS MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WE SHALL HEAR NOTHING BUT THE USUAL COMMONPLACE THINGS PORTHOS SUCKED HIS MUSTACHE MUTTERING
IT WAS CAPTAIN GROSLOW THE READER WILL REMEMBER WHO HAD BROKEN PARRY'S HEAD D'ARTAGNAN RESUMED IMMEDIATELY THE ATTITUDE OF DISTRUST THAT WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM HE FOUND THE WHARF TOO COMPLETELY DESERTED
BESIDES WE CAN BUT BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE PROVES FALSE SAID THE GASCON
THAT SETS MY MIND AT REST DEFEND YOURSELF ONE MINUTE SAID THE YOUNG MAN GIVE ME YOUR WORD GENTLEMEN
GREATLY TO THE CAPTAIN'S ALARM INTO THE INTERSTICES BETWEEN THE BARRELS AND FINDING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING CONCEALED IN THEM COME ALONG HE SAID AND HE WENT TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE SECOND COMPARTMENT STOP
SAID THE SAILOR YES JUST SO ALONG THE ISLE OF DOGS AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE BOAT MORE THAN ANOTHER
OF COURSE THEY WILL DO SO AS HONORABLE GENTLEMEN AND THE BEST PROOF I CAN FURNISH IS THIS SO SAYING HE THREW HIS HAT ON THE GROUND
NO BUT I WISH TO HAVE A SHARE IN MY REVENGE HAVEN'T YOU SOME ONE WHO WILL RELIEVE ME OF MY HORSE GROSLOW WHISTLED AND A SAILOR APPEARED PATRICK SAID GROSLOW TAKE THIS HORSE TO THE STABLES OF THE NEAREST INN IF ANY ONE ASKS YOU WHOSE IT IS
AND FOR MY PART GENTLEMEN I ADMIRE YOU YOU ARE DISPUTING WHICH SHALL FIGHT ME FIRST BUT YOU DO NOT CONSULT ME WHO AM MOST CONCERNED IN THE MATTER I HATE YOU ALL BUT NOT EQUALLY I HOPE TO KILL ALL FOUR OF YOU BUT I AM MORE LIKELY TO KILL THE FIRST THAN THE SECOND
THE CAPTAIN TOO ACCOMMODATING HE HAD REPORTED TO ARAMIS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND ARAMIS NOT LESS DISTRUSTFUL THAN HE HAD INCREASED HIS SUSPICIONS
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A FALSE LOOK YOU HAVE PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE AFRAID LOOK AT MY EYES AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT NO LOOKING GLASS HAS EVER SHOWN YOU A FRANK AND HONORABLE COUNTENANCE
MORDAUNT DID NOT REPLY JUST NOW D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED YOU WERE DISGUISED I MEAN TO SAY ATTIRED AS A MURDERER AND NOW AND NOW I LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO IS GOING TO BE MURDERED OH SIR
MORDAUNT REMEMBERED THAT CROMWELL HAD TOLD HIM HE HAD HAD NO DETAILED ACCOUNT
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE MORDAUNT HE CRIED AH BY HEAVEN
AND THUS REACHED THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE WHERE HE PAUSED TO EXAMINE HIMSELF AND TO TAKE BREATH GOOD HE SAID NOTHING ALMOST NOTHING SCRATCHES NOTHING MORE TWO IN THE ARM AND ONE IN THE BREAST THE WOUNDS THAT I MAKE ARE BETTER THAN THAT
WITNESS THE EXECUTIONER OF BETHUNE MY UNCLE AND KING CHARLES NOW NOT A SECOND TO LOSE FOR A SECOND LOST WILL PERHAPS SAVE THEM THEY MUST DIE DIE ALL TOGETHER KILLED AT ONE STROKE BY THE THUNDER OF MEN IN DEFAULT OF GOD'S
AND BOWED TO MORDAUNT WITH TRUE FRENCH GRACE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR HE CONTINUED MY SWORD IS SHORTER THAN YOURS IT'S TRUE BUT BAH I THINK THE ARM WILL MAKE UP FOR THE SWORD HALT CRIED PORTHOS COMING FORWARD I BEGIN AND WITHOUT ANY RHETORIC
HAS ONLY HASTENED THEIR FLIGHT IN TEN MINUTES THEY WILL PERHAPS BE HERE WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR THEN TO EMBARK WITH YOU AH AH THE GENERAL DOUBTED MY FIDELITY
MUTTERED D'ARTAGNAN I WOULD GIVE MY CHANCE OF A CAPTAINCY IN THE MOUSQUETAIRES FOR THAT TO BE MY NAME ARAMIS OPENED THE PAPER AND IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH HATE AND VENGEANCE READ D'ARTAGNAN THE GASCON UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND TURNING TO MORDAUNT
TO THIS FLOW OF WORDS NOT PERHAPS IN THE BEST TASTE BUT CHARACTERISTIC OF D'ARTAGNAN WHOSE PRINCIPAL OBJECT WAS TO DIVERT HIS OPPONENT'S ATTENTION MORDAUNT DID NOT REPLY BUT CONTINUING TO TURN AROUND HE SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING PLACES WITH D'ARTAGNAN
DEXTEROUS IN HIS EAGERNESS FOR VENGEANCE SEIZED A ROPE AND CLIMBED UP THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL WITH A COOLNESS AND AGILITY VERY RARE AMONG LANDSMEN HE WENT WITH GROSLOW TO THE CAPTAIN'S BERTH A SORT OF TEMPORARY CABIN OF PLANKS
THE ONLY SUBLIME IDEAS IN POLITICS ARE THOSE WHICH BEAR FRUIT SO TO NIGHT MORDAUNT GO TO GREENWICH AND ASK FOR THE CAPTAIN OF THE FELUCCA LIGHTNING SHOW HIM A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF KNOTTED AT THE FOUR CORNERS AND TELL THE CREW TO DISEMBARK AND CARRY THE POWDER BACK TO THE ARSENAL UNLESS INDEED
CONFESS MONSIEUR MORDAUNT THAT YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO KILL SOME OF US ALL REPLIED MORDAUNT THEN MY DEAR SIR
AND OF THEIR LACKEYS WHICH HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE HOST IN SETTLEMENT OF THEIR ACCOUNT WITH HIM THANKS TO THIS STROKE OF BUSINESS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE ABLE TO TAKE AWAY WITH THEM A SUM OF MONEY WHICH IF NOT LARGE
IT SEEMS A LIKELY STORY TO ME
LIGHTNING INTERRUPTED MORDAUNT THEN MINE IS THE BOAT YOU WANT SIR I'M YOUR MAN I BEGIN TO THINK SO PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN A CERTAIN SIGNAL
HUSH SAID GRIMAUD HE IS COMING OUT
THREW HIMSELF IN THE WAY WITH A MASK ON HIS FACE AND AN AXE IN HIS HAND
SAID D'ARTAGNAN HOW CAN YOU TALK LIKE THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE COMPANY OF GENTLEMEN
IT WAS IN FACT MORDAUNT WHOM D'ARTAGNAN HAD FOLLOWED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
FROM THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS TONE DID NOT SEEM LIKE A PURE INVENTION IT SUDDENLY FLASHED UPON HER MIND THAT SHE HERSELF HAD HEARD VOICES IN THE GARDEN
WHO HAD STEPPED ACROSS THE DOORWAY AND ABOUT THE HANDSOME FLAXEN MOUSTACHED BLUE EYED CAVALIER WHO HAD FOLLOWED HER IN AND THEY WOULD LOOK ONE TO ANOTHER
DANGLE HAD FLARED AND THUNDERED ACROSS THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE SUMMER EVENING DANGLE SWAYING AND GESTICULATING BEHIND A CORYBANTIC BLACK HORSE HAD HAILED JESSIE BY HER NAME
OF THE IRREGULAR BUILDING BEFORE HER THAN UPON THAT OCCUPIED BY HER MOTHER FOR SHE COULD NOT HELP EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE SOME ONE RUN OUT WITH A WILD FACE
IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S HEAD THE MOMENT BEFORE HE HEARD THAT REMARK BUT THE REMARK TOPPLED HIM HEADLONG WHAT THE PRECISE REMARK WAS NEED NOT CONCERN US IT WAS
WILL BE JUST AS USEFUL NOW AS IF I HAD MARRIED MYSELF POOR MATILDA BUT YOU WON'T EXPECT ME TO JOIN IN YOU HARDLY CAN I CAN SHEER OFF THAT DAY VERY EASILY YOU KNOW
YOU WERE SAYING SAID THE FAIR YOUNG MAN WITH THE WHITE TIE SPEAKING VERY POLITELY THAT YOU CAME HERE WITH A LADY A LADY MEDITATED THE GAITER GAZER
POOR MATILDA MURMURED BOB THERE I WAS AFRAID TWOULD HURT THY FEELINGS SAID THE MILLER WITH SELF REPROACH MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THY WEDDING AND USING THEM FOR MY OWN
TO THE ODD MAN OF THE PLACE WITH INFINITE EASY DIGNITY AND HAD BOWINGLY OPENED THE DOOR FOR JESSIE WHO'S THAT THEN HE IMAGINED PEOPLE SAYING AND THEN
THERE'S SUCH A THIN AS ENTERTAINING BARRANETS UNAWARES NOT TO MENTION NO HIGHER THINGS SUCH I SAY HAD BEEN THE FILMY DELIGHTFUL STUFF
AT LENGTH HE WAS SO BALANCED BETWEEN THE IMPULSE TO GO ON AND THE IMPULSE TO GO BACK THAT A PUFF OF WIND EITHER WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL NIGH SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE FOR HIM
HE SAID FAITH THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE FOLLOWED HER IF I HAD BEEN AS SURE AS YOU WERE THAT SHE WENT AWAY IN SCORN OF US SINCE YOU TOLD ME THAT
UNDER THE APPLE TREE BUT SHE WAS NOT FACING IN HIS DIRECTION HE WALKED WITH A NOISIER TREAD
APPEALING TO EVERYONE EXCEPT HOOPDRIVER HERE'S ME GOT TO TAKE IN HER LADYSHIP'S DINNER TO MORROW NIGHT HOW SHOULD I LOOK WITH A BLACK EYE AND GOING ROUND WITH THE CARRIAGE
MORE POSSIBLY THAN YOU WILL DESIRE THE REMARK I MUST ADD IMPLICATED MISTER HOOPDRIVER IT INDICATED AN ENTIRE DISBELIEF IN HIS SOCIAL STANDING
BULLER'S YARD SAID THE MAN WITH THE GAITERS TAKING THE CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE AFFAIR WITH THE EASY READINESS OF AN ACCOMPLISHED PRACTITIONER IF THE GENTLEMAN DON'T MIND
THEN INCIDENT HAD FLICKERED INTO INCIDENT UNTIL HERE HE WAS OUT IN A MOONLIT LANE A SLIGHT DARK FIGURE IN A GROUP OF LARGER INDISTINCT FIGURES
MISTER HOOPDRIVER COUGHED I CAME HERE SIR
HE WAS EXPLAINING WITH A HAPPY FLUKE OF HIS IMAGINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS IGNORANCE THEN SUDDENLY HERALDED BY CLATTERING SOUNDS AND A GRIDE OF WHEELS
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT HER
THAT SHOWED HE WASN'T FIT TO WIPE BOOTS ON AND WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE TO SUCH GENTLEMEN AS ARE GENTLEMEN MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKED ROUND FOR MORAL SUPPORT I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IT WAS
GROUND WITH HIS BACK TO THE GATE HOW DID ONE SQUARE SO SUPPOSE ONE WERE TO TURN AND RUN EVEN NOW RUN STRAIGHT BACK TO THE INN AND LOCK HIMSELF INTO HIS BEDROOM
THE ROADS ABOUT HERE ARE ALL RIGHT
BUT OF INTENSE PREOCCUPATION PRESENTLY LOVEDAY THE FATHER CAME TO THE DOOR HER MOTHER VANISHED WITH HIM AND THEY REMAINED CLOSETED TOGETHER A LONG TIME
TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE SURMISE ON THE CAUSE OF MISS JOHNSON'S DISAPPEARANCE THAT THE HUMAN MIND COULD FRAME TO WHICH ANNE RETURNED MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS THE RESULT NOT OF INDIFFERENCE
AND WAS MOUNTING STILL STARING AT THE CORNER THAT HAD SWALLOWED UP DANGLE HOOPDRIVER FOLLOWED SUIT AND SO JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING THEY BEGAN ANOTHER FLIGHT TOGETHER RIDING NOW
AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW THE NEIGHBOURS
THROUGH STICKING SO CLOSELY TO BUSINESS THAT DAY WELL JOHN BOB HAS TOLD YOU ALL OF COURSE A QUEER
PROTESTED CHARLIE YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
A YOUNG FELLOW SMOKING A CUTTY AND DISPLAYING CROSSED LEGS WITH GAITERS
THROUGH THE BACK PREMISES OF THE INN TO THE FIRST AND ONLY FIGHT WITH FISTS THAT WAS EVER TO GLORIFY HIS LIFE
I
HE TURNED HIS HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT HE BECAME ACTIVE
HAVE MADE UP A MATCH AND MEAN TO MARRY AT ONCE THAT THE WEDDING VICTUALS MAY NOT BE WASTED THEY FELT TWOULD BE A THOUSAND PITIES TO LET
WHEN THEY KNOW THE HARM IT DOES IT MADE MY HEART ACHE TO SEE THOSE BOYS WHO OUGHT TO BE AT HOME AND IN THEIR BEDS GOING OFF FOR A NIGHT OF RIOT WHICH WOULD HELP TO RUIN SOME OF THEM FOR EVER
HAVE A GAY OLD TIME AND BE A HOWLING SWELL IF I CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME THOUGH
INNOCENTLY CONFIRMING MISSUS JO'S SUSPICIONS SO I UNDERSTOOD AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT
AND IT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO WRONG WE ALL RESPECT HIM SO ADDED DOLLY LOOKING UP NOW WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH ASSURED HIS MENTOR THAT THE RIGHT STRING HAD BEEN TOUCHED AND A SPIRIT OF EMULATION ROUSED MORE HELPFUL PERHAPS THAN ANY WORDS OF HERS
WHEN BOOKS PICTURES BALL ROOMS THEATRES AND STREETS OFFER TEMPTATIONS YET YOU CAN RESIST IF YOU TRY LAST WINTER MISSUS BROOKE USED TO WORRY ABOUT JOHN'S BEING OUT SO LATE REPORTING
MY DEAR BOYS IF I DIDN'T LOVE YOU I WOULD NOT SAY THESE THINGS
DON'T HURRY I BEG STAY AND REST YOU MUST NEED IT AFTER THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BRAIN WORK YOU'VE DONE THIS WEEK IT IS TIME FOR OUR GREEK COME BESS GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN
SO SHE WOKE THE PEACEFUL SLEEPER BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A STRAW TILL HE SNEEZED HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND LOOKED WRATHFULLY ABOUT FOR THAT CONFOUNDED FLY COME SIT UP AND LET US HAVE A LITTLE ELEGANT CONVERSATION
HAVE SOME YES THANKS VERY MUCH LET US POUR IT AND DOLLY HELD THE CUP WHILE STUFFY JOYFULLY FILLED IT BOTH VERY GRATEFUL BUT RATHER AFRAID SHE HAD HEARD WHAT WENT BEFORE THE WISH SHE FULFILLED
CHAPTER SIXTEEN IN THE TENNIS COURT ATHLETIC SPORTS WERE IN HIGH FAVOUR AT PLUMFIELD AND THE RIVER WHERE THE OLD PUNT USED TO WABBLE ABOUT WITH A CARGO OF SMALL BOYS OR ECHO TO THE SHRILL SCREAMS OF LITTLE GIRLS TRYING TO GET LILIES
A TRANQUIL SNORE WAS STUFFY'S SOLE REPLY AND A GENERAL LAUGH RESTORED PEACE FOR THE MOMENT BUT JOSIE LOVED TO HARASS THE LORDS OF CREATION WHO ASSERTED THEMSELVES TOO MUCH AND BIDED HER TIME FOR ANOTHER ATTACK TILL SHE HAD SECURED MORE TENNIS
MUCH IMPRESSED BY THAT DIRE THREAT DOLLY HELPED HER FROM HER PERCH WITH DEEP RESPECT AND STUFFY RELIEVED HER OF HER EMPTY JUGS SOLEMNLY VOWING TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL FERMENTED BEVERAGES EXCEPT ROOT BEER AS LONG AS FEEBLE FLESH COULD HOLD OUT
YOU HOWLING SWELLS OUGHT TO IMPROVE OUR MINDS AND MANNERS FOR WE ARE ONLY POOR COUNTRY GIRLS IN DOWDY GOWNS AND HATS BEGAN THE GAD FLY
AND BY AND BY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK INNOCENT GIRLS TO LOVE YOU YES'M THANK YOU I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD WORK TO TOE THE MARK WHEN LADIES GIVE YOU WINE AND GENTLEMEN TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS TO SEE AIMEE SAID DOLLY
AND NOT ONLY SAVE YOURSELVES BUT HELP OTHERS BY A BRAVE EXAMPLE COME TO ME IF THINGS WORRY YOU
JOSIE PAUSED A MOMENT TO RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING CALLED A LITTLE GIRL WHEN ALL THE HONOURS OF HER FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY WERE FRESH UPON HER AND BESS SAID IN THE LOFTY TONE WHICH WAS INFINITELY MORE CRUSHING THAN JO'S IMPERTINENCE THAT IS TRUE
OR A TAILOR AND LIVED FOR CLOTHES COME NOW DON'T HIT A FELLOW WHEN HE IS DOWN RESPONDED DOLLY FROM THE GRASS WHERE HE AND STUFFY NOW LAY TO MAKE ROOM FOR BOTH GIRLS ON THE SEAT ONE HANDKERCHIEF WAS SPREAD UNDER HIM AND HIS ELBOW LEANED UPON ANOTHER
AND MISSUS JO TURNED TO THE OTHER CULPRIT WHO SHOOK IN HIS SHOES AND WISHED HE HADN'T COME ARE YOU STUDYING FRENCH AS INDUSTRIOUSLY AS YOU WERE LAST WINTER NO MA'AM I DON'T CARE FOR IT
AND PUT IT ON AGAIN AT ONCE AS IF GLAD TO GET THE DUTY OVER THE SLENDER BEING WITH THE CRIMSON TIE LIFTED HIS WITH A GRACEFUL BEND AND HELD IT ALOFT WHILE HE ACCOSTED THE ROSY BREATHLESS MAID THUS PERMITTING HER TO SEE HIS RAVEN LOCKS SMOOTHLY PARTED
I HAVE HEARD MANY SADDER CONFESSIONS THAN ANY YOU ARE EVER LIKELY TO BRING ME AND BEEN ABLE TO COMFORT MANY POOR FELLOWS GONE WRONG FOR WANT OF A WORD IN TIME DO THIS AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KISS YOUR MOTHERS WITH CLEAN LIPS
FOLLOWING HER COUSIN'S LEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT A HAPPY ONE OUR BOYS LIKE TO HAVE US TALK WITH THEM AND TAKE KINDLY ANY HINTS WE GIVE THEY DON'T THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING AND ARE QUITE PERFECT AT EIGHTEEN AS I'VE OBSERVED THE HARVARD MEN DO
FANNING HERSELF WITH A LARGE LEAF JOSIE WAS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE RUSTIC SEAT AND WAIT WHEN HER QUICK EYE SAW AFAR OFF TWO MANLY FORMS ARRAYED IN WHITE FLANNEL THEIR BLUE LEGS SEEMED BEARING THEM TOWARDS THE BATTLE GOING ON IN THE DISTANCE
MY PEACE WHEN A WORD MAY KEEP YOU FROM TWO OF THE GREAT SINS THAT CURSE THE WORLD AND SEND SO MANY YOUNG MEN TO DESTRUCTION YOU ARE JUST BEGINNING TO FEEL THE ALLUREMENT OF THEM AND SOON IT WILL BE HARD TO TURN AWAY STOP NOW I BEG OF YOU
BUT THEY NEVER REACHED THE FRAY FOR WITH A CRY OF JOY JO RACED AWAY TO MEET THEM BENT ON SECURING THIS HEAVEN SENT REINFORCEMENT BOTH PAUSED AS SHE CAME FLYING UP AND BOTH RAISED THEIR HATS BUT OH THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE SALUTES
I'D RATHER MY BOYS SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT AND COLD SHOULDERED BY A HUNDRED FOOLISH FELLOWS THAN LOSE WHAT ONCE GONE NO POWER CAN GIVE THEM BACK INNOCENCE AND SELF RESPECT I DON'T WONDER YOU FIND IT HARD TO TOE THE MARK
BUT WE HAVE LIVED ALL OUR LIVES WITH SUPERIOR PEOPLE
YOUR GOWNS ARE ALL RIGHT AND THOSE HATS THE LATEST THING OUT BEGAN POOR DOLPHUS CONVICTING HIMSELF BY THE INCAUTIOUS EXCLAMATION CAUGHT YOU THAT TIME I THOUGHT YOU FELLOWS WERE ALL GENTLEMEN CIVIL AS WELL AS NICE
BUT THE GIRLS WHO LOVE STUDY WISH TO BE TREATED LIKE REASONABLE BEINGS NOT DOLLS TO FLIRT WITH YES I'M GOING TO PREACH THAT'S MY BUSINESS SO STAND UP AND TAKE IT LIKE MEN MISSUS JO LAUGHED BUT SHE WAS IN EARNEST
WHICH PRODUCED AN UNSIGHTLY STAIN UPON THE KNEE OF THOSE NEW SHORTS HAD NOT DISTRACTED HIS MIND AND MADE HIM CARELESS MUCH ELATED AT HER VICTORY JOSIE PERMITTED HIM TO REST AND OFFERED IRONICAL CONSOLATION FOR THE MISHAP WHICH EVIDENTLY WEIGHED UPON HIS MIND
SEEING THIS SHE WAS SATISFIED AND SAID AS SHE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE BAR BEFORE WHICH HER CULPRITS HAD BEEN TRIED AND FOUND GUILTY BUT RECOMMENDED TO MERCY THEN BE TO OTHERS WHAT JOHN IS TO YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE
I WILL GO ON NOW FOR I MUST HURRY OR NIGHT WILL OVERTAKE ME AND I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THE PATH
WHAR WAS YOU TRYIN TO GIT TO MISTER WHERE AM I TRYING TO GET TO AS THE MAN REPEATED JED'S QUESTION HE DREW HIS HAND WEARILY ACROSS HIS BROW
WITH BIG BONES BROAD SHOULDERS AND MIGHTY MUSCLES AT LOG ROLLINGS AND CHOPPING BEES IN THE FIELD OR AT THE MILL OR IN ANY OF THE GAMES IN WHICH THE BACKWOODSMAN TRIES HIS STRENGTH
HE WITHDREW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN TO RETURN LATER WHEN THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE YOUNG MAN STOOD STROKING THE PONY AS THE LITTLE HORSE MUNCHED HIS GENEROUS FEED OF CORN
DO YOU THINK THIS MISTER LANE WOULD ENTERTAIN ME JED PUSHED A HAND UP UNDER HIS TATTERED OLD HAT AND SCRATCHED AWHILE BEFORE HE ANSWERED
WHEN THEY REACHED THE BIG LOG HOUSE THAT LOOKS DOWN UPON THE HOLLOW THE BOY WENT AT ONCE WITH HIS AXE TO THE WOODPILE WHILE THE OLDER MAN BUSIED HIMSELF WITH THE MILKING AND OTHER CHORES ABOUT THE BARN
SMALL WONDER OUR LIVES HAVE SO LITTLE OF GOD IN THEM WHEN WE COME IN TOUCH WITH SO LITTLE THAT GOD HAS MADE YOU LIVE IN THE CITY THEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME ASKED MISTER MATTHEWS LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT HIS GUEST
THE ELDER MAN LAID HIS HAND ON THE BROAD SHOULDER OF THE LAD SO LIKE HIM AND LOOKED FULL INTO THE CLEAR EYES IS IT ALRIGHT SON HE ASKED GRUFFLY AND THE BOY ANSWERED AS HE RETURNED HIS FATHER'S LOOK
THE MAN FROM THE CITY SAW THAT HIS BIG HOST WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST AND ANSWERED QUIETLY NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH THINGS MISTER MATTHEWS BUT IF IT SHOULD BE TRUE
IN THE CROWDED CITY CEMETERY THE GROUND IS ALWAYS SHAKEN BY THE TRAMPING OF FUNERAL PROFESSIONS HE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS FOR SOME TIME THE STRANGER SAT THUS WHILE HIS HOST SPOKE NO WORD
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU WAS A COMIN OVER REPLIED THE WOMAN IN THE DOORWAY I WAS A TELLIN THE MENFOLKS THIS MORNIN THAT YOU HADN'T BEEN NIGH THE WHOLE BLESSED WEEK MISTER MATTHEWS LOWED MAYBE YOU WAS SICK THE OTHER RETURNED WITH A GAY LAUGH
SEEMING AT LAST TO LOSE ITSELF IN THE MISTS SLOWLY OLD MATT SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT AND THE STRANGER HEARD HIM MUTTER POOR BOY POOR BOY
IT'S NO USE HONEY SAID MISSUS MATTHEWS BREAKING THE SILENCE IT JUST AIN'T NO USE
I DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD FEAR THE DEAD THE OTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW SIR I ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE BUT SOME THINGS IS MIGHTY QUEER
THE MOUNTAINEER RELIGHTED HIS PIPE WHILE YOUNG MATT AND SAMMY SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE STEP AND MISSUS MATTHEWS COMING FROM THE HOUSE JOINED THE GROUP WE'VE JUST NATURALLY GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY TO STAY WITH THEM SHEEP DAD SAID THE SON
HE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO THE MISTS ON EVERY HAND AND PAUSED FREQUENTLY AS IF QUESTIONING THE PROPER COURSE SUDDENLY HE STEPPED QUICKLY FORWARD
AND LIKE THE BROWN EYES BETRAYED THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE MAN DENIED BY HIS GRAY HAIR AND BENT FORM THE TONES WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM THE HIGH KEYED SLURRING SPEECH OF THE BACKWOODS AS THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS UNLIKE ANY MAN JED HAD EVER MET
THE DEEP VOICE FALTERED PARDON ME SIR FOR SPEAKING OF THIS BUT MY LAD WAS SO LIKE YOUR BOY THERE HE WAS ALL I HAD AND NOW
IN MEMORY OF THAT BEAUTIFUL SUMMER IN THE OZARK HILLS WHEN SO OFTEN WE FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL AROUND THE RISE OF MUTTON HOLLOW THE TRAIL THAT IS NOBODY KNOWS HOW OLD AND FROM SAMMY'S LOOKOUT
THEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY AWAY AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED TOWARD THE HOUSE WHILE THE BOY PRETENDING TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE PONY'S BRIDLE WATCHED HER AS SHE WENT WHEN THE GIRL WAS GONE THE BIG FELLOW LED THE HORSE AWAY TO THE STABLE
THEN LIFTING HIS HEAD THE MAN LOOKED AWAY OVER THE RIDGES JUST TOUCHED WITH THE LINGERING LIGHT AND THE VALLEY BELOW WRAPPED IN THE SHADOWY MISTS I CAME AWAY FROM IT ALL BECAUSE THEY SAID I MUST
OF CULTURE THE FACE OF A SCHOLAR AND POET BUT IT WAS MORE IT WAS THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE FAIRLY STAGGERING UNDER A BURDEN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND GRIEF AS THE STRANGER WALKED
THERE AIN'T NOBODY THERE TO NIGHT AND AS NEAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT THERE'S THREE EWES AND THEIR LAMBS MISSING THERE AIN'T A BIT OF USE IN US TRYING TO DEPEND ON PETE I'LL RIDE OVER ON BEAR CREEK TO MORROW AND SEE IF I CAN GET THAT FELLOW BUCK TOLD US ABOUT
HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AS HE RAISED HIS ARMS TO ASSIST THE GIRL TO DISMOUNT THE TEASING LIGHT VANISHED AS THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACED HER HANDS ON THE POWERFUL SHOULDERS OF THE GIANT
THE STRANGER WHOM JED HAD MET ON THE OLD TRAIL STOOD AT THE GATE CHAPTER THREE THE VOICE FROM OUT THE MISTS WHILE YOUNG MATT WAS GONE TO THE CORRAL IN THE VALLEY
WILL MISTER MATTHEWS KEEP ME DO YOU THINK JED WHO WAS STILL LOOKING UP THE TRAIL SUDDENLY LEANED FORWARD AND POINTING INTO THE TIMBER TO THE LEFT OF THE PATH SAID IN AN EXCITING WHISPER LOOK AT THAT MISTER
HIS EAR HAD CAUGHT THE SHARP RING OF A HORSE'S SHOE ON A FLINT ROCK SOMEWHERE IN THE MISTS ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ABOVE IT WAS JED HOLLAND COMING DOWN THE TRAIL WITH A WEEK'S SUPPLY OF CORN MEAL IN A SACK ACROSS HIS HORSE'S BACK
AND THE EYES WERE HONEST EYES ANYONE MEETING THE PAIR AS THEY WALKED WITH THE LONG SWINGING STRIDE OF THE MOUNTAINEER UP THE STEEP MILL ROAD THAT GRAY AFTERNOON WOULD HAVE TURNED FOR A SECOND LOOK SUCH MEN ARE SELDOM SEEN
I HAVE ALLIES THE POLES THERE ARE EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THEM AND THEY FIGHT LIKE LIONS AND THERE WILL BE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM
AND LET HIM KNOW THAT I WILL DO SO SAID NAPOLEON RISING AND PUSHING HIS CUP AWAY WITH HIS HAND
SHE HAD MERELY BECOME MORE SELF CONFIDENT PRINCE ANDREW THOUGHT DESSALLES THE TUTOR HE HAD BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND WAS WEARING A COAT OF RUSSIAN CUT AND TALKING BROKEN RUSSIAN TO THE SERVANTS
NAPOLEON ALMOST SCREAMED QUITE TO HIS OWN SURPRISE IF YOU GAVE ME PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW I COULD NOT ACCEPT SUCH CONDITIONS YOU SAY I HAVE BEGUN THIS WAR BUT WHO FIRST JOINED HIS ARMY
I MYSELF DON'T KNOW I WANT TO MEET THAT MAN WHOM I DESPISE SO AS TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO KILL AND LAUGH AT ME THESE CONDITIONS OF LIFE HAD BEEN THE SAME BEFORE BUT THEN THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED WHILE NOW THEY HAD ALL TUMBLED TO PIECES ONLY SENSELESS THINGS
AND YET WHAT A SPLENDID REIGN
BY HIS WILLINGNESS AND ACCURACY IN WORK NOT HAVING FOUND KURAGIN IN TURKEY PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO RUSH BACK TO RUSSIA AFTER HIM
THAT I AM AS DEVOTED TO HIM AS BEFORE I KNOW HIM THOROUGHLY AND VERY HIGHLY ESTEEM HIS LOFTY QUALITIES I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER GENERAL YOU SHALL RECEIVE MY LETTER TO THE EMPEROR AND NAPOLEON WENT QUICKLY TO THE DOOR
BUT FELL INTO A REVERIE WITHOUT FINISHING THE STORY HE THOUGHT NOT OF THIS PRETTY CHILD HIS SON WHOM HE HELD ON HIS KNEE BUT OF HIMSELF HE SOUGHT IN HIMSELF EITHER REMORSE FOR HAVING ANGERED HIS FATHER OR REGRET AT LEAVING HOME
HE NODDED IN ANSWER TO BALASHAV'S LOW AND RESPECTFUL BOW AND COMING UP TO HIM AT ONCE BEGAN SPEAKING LIKE A MAN WHO VALUES EVERY MOMENT OF HIS TIME AND DOES NOT CONDESCEND TO PREPARE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY BUT IS SURE HE WILL ALWAYS SAY THE RIGHT THING AND SAY IT WELL
ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD WITNESSED HIS UNSEEMLY ANGER BUT TO HIS SURPRISE BALASHEV RECEIVED THROUGH DUROC AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE EMPEROR THAT DAY BESSIERES CAULAINCOURT AND BERTHIER WERE PRESENT AT THAT DINNER
KNOW THAT IF YOU STIR UP PRUSSIA AGAINST ME I'LL WIPE IT OFF THE MAP OF EUROPE HE DECLARED HIS FACE PALE AND DISTORTED BY ANGER AND HE STRUCK ONE OF HIS SMALL HANDS ENERGETICALLY WITH THE OTHER YES I WILL THROW YOU BACK BEYOND THE DVINA AND BEYOND THE DNIEPER
WHO MORE THAN ONCE LOWERED HIS EYES INVOLUNTARILY NOTICED THE QUIVERING OF NAPOLEON'S LEFT LEG WHICH INCREASED THE MORE NAPOLEON RAISED HIS VOICE I DESIRE PEACE NO LESS THAN THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER HE BEGAN
MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE SAYS HE HAS BEEN ASKING ABOUT YOU
I HEAR YOU HAVE MADE PEACE WITH TURKEY
BUT NAPOLEON GAVE AN ANGRY EXCLAMATION TO DROWN HIS VOICE NAPOLEON WAS IN THAT STATE OF IRRITABILITY IN WHICH A MAN HAS TO TALK TALK AND TALK MERELY TO CONVINCE HIMSELF
YES FOUR DAYS AGO IN THIS ROOM WINTZINGERODE AND STEIN WERE DELIBERATING CONTINUED NAPOLEON WITH THE SAME DERISIVE AND SELF CONFIDENT SMILE
BALASHEV NOTICED THAT HIS LEFT LEG WAS QUIVERING FASTER THAN BEFORE AND HIS FACE SEEMED PETRIFIED IN ITS STERN EXPRESSION THIS QUIVERING OF HIS LEFT LEG WAS A THING NAPOLEON WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE VIBRATION OF MY LEFT CALF IS A GREAT SIGN WITH ME
OPENING IN FRONT OVER A WHITE WAISTCOAT SO LONG THAT IT COVERED HIS ROTUND STOMACH WHITE LEATHER BREECHES TIGHTLY FITTING THE FAT THIGHS OF HIS SHORT LEGS AND HESSIAN BOOTS HIS SHORT HAIR HAD EVIDENTLY JUST BEEN BRUSHED
AND AN UNNATURAL SMILE DISCLOSED THE FRESH GAP BETWEEN HIS TEETH TO WHICH PRINCE ANDREW COULD NOT GET ACCUSTOMED WHAT COMPANION MY DEAR BOY EH YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TALKING IT OVER EH
WAR IS MY PROFESSION BUT HIS BUSINESS IS TO REIGN AND NOT TO COMMAND ARMIES
BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AS ENVOY HE FEARED TO DEMEAN HIS DIGNITY AND FELT THE NECESSITY OF REPLYING BUT AS A MAN HE SHRANK BEFORE THE TRANSPORT OF GROUNDLESS WRATH THAT HAD EVIDENTLY SEIZED NAPOLEON
YOU ARE FLURRIED COMPOSE YOURSELF NAPOLEON SEEMED TO SAY AS WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE HE LOOKED AT BALASHEV'S UNIFORM AND SWORD BALASHEV RECOVERED HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO SPEAK
ANDREW ONE THING I BEG I ENTREAT OF YOU SHE SAID TOUCHING HIS ELBOW AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH EYES THAT SHONE THROUGH HER TEARS I UNDERSTAND YOU SHE LOOKED DOWN DON'T IMAGINE THAT SORROW IS THE WORK OF MEN
AGAIN NAPOLEON BROUGHT OUT HIS SNUFFBOX PACED SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN SILENCE
USELESSLY AND JOYLESSLY PASSING THE BEST YEARS OF HER LIFE IN FEAR AND CONSTANT SUFFERING MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WAS THE SAME COQUETTISH SELF SATISFIED GIRL ENJOYING EVERY MOMENT OF HER EXISTENCE AND FULL OF JOYOUS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT THE RUSSIAN ENVOY BALASHEV BEGAN A SPEECH HE HAD PREPARED LONG BEFORE SIRE THE EMPEROR MY MASTER BUT THE SIGHT OF THE EMPEROR'S EYES BENT ON HIM CONFUSED HIM
BOTH HALVES OF IT WERE OPENED RAPIDLY ALL WAS SILENT AND THEN FROM THE STUDY THE SOUND WAS HEARD OF OTHER STEPS FIRM AND RESOLUTE THEY WERE THOSE OF NAPOLEON HE HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING FOR HIS RIDE AND WORE A BLUE UNIFORM
THE EMPEROR WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS AFTER HIS RIDE THROUGH VILNA WHERE CROWDS OF PEOPLE HAD RAPTUROUSLY GREETED AND FOLLOWED HIM FROM ALL THE WINDOWS OF THE STREETS THROUGH WHICH HE RODE RUGS FLAGS AND HIS MONOGRAM WERE DISPLAYED
LOOKING AT THE MOVEMENTS OF NAPOLEON'S STOUT LEGS
HE EMPHASIZED THE WORD I AM READY TO RECEIVE ANY EXPLANATIONS YOU CAN GIVE ME
DESPITE HIS CONTEMPT FOR HIM AND DESPITE ALL THE PROOFS HE DEDUCED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH STOOPING TO A CONFLICT WITH HIM HE KNEW THAT WHEN HE DID MEET HIM HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST CALLING HIM OUT ANY MORE THAN A RAVENOUS MAN CAN HELP SNATCHING AT FOOD
BUT IN ORDER TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WHAT IS DEMANDED OF ME HE SAID FROWNING AND MAKING AN ENERGETIC GESTURE OF INQUIRY WITH HIS SMALL WHITE PLUMP HAND THE WITHDRAWAL OF YOUR ARMY BEYOND THE NIEMEN
AND IS ONLY DIFFERENT IN THE DEGREES OF FORCE AND LIVELINESS THE CONSTANT CONJUNCTION OF OUR RESEMBLING PERCEPTIONS IS A CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE ONE ARE THE CAUSES OF THE OTHER
OF THE PROBABILITY OF CHANCES
THAT THEY SHALL AT LEAST BE NATURAL AND ENTERTAINING AND INDEED NOTHING BUT THE MOST DETERMINED SCEPTICISM ALONG WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF INDOLENCE CAN JUSTIFY THIS AVERSION TO METAPHYSICS
AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOVE A WHOLE CENTURY SINCE WE FIND IN FACT THAT THERE WAS ABOUT THE SAME INTERVAL BETWIXT THE ORIGINS OF THESE SCIENCES
WHEN I SHUT MY EYES AND THINK OF MY CHAMBER THE IDEAS I FORM ARE EXACT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS I FELT NOR IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE ONE WHICH IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE OTHER
AND THAT I MUST MAKE USE OF THE DISTINCTION OF PERCEPTIONS INTO SIMPLE AND COMPLEX TO LIMIT THIS GENERAL DECISION THAT ALL OUR IDEAS AND IMPRESSIONS ARE RESEMBLING
THE SPACE OF TIME IS NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT BETWIXT MY LORD BACON AND SOME LATE PHILOSOPHERS MISTER LOCKE MY LORD SHAFTESBURY DOCTOR MANDEVILLE MISTER HUTCHINSON DOCTOR BUTLER ET CETERA IN ENGLAND
MUST BE LAID ON EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION IT IS NO ASTONISHING REFLECTION TO CONSIDER THAT THE APPLICATION OF EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY TO MORAL SUBJECTS SHOULD COME AFTER THAT TO NATURAL
I HERE MAKE USE OF THESE TERMS IMPRESSION AND IDEA IN A SENSE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS USUAL AND I HOPE THIS LIBERTY WILL BE ALLOWED ME PERHAPS I RATHER RESTORE THE WORD IDEA
NOTHING IS MORE USUAL AND MORE NATURAL FOR THOSE WHO PRETEND TO DISCOVER ANYTHING NEW TO THE WORLD IN PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES THAN TO INSINUATE THE PRAISES OF THEIR OWN SYSTEMS BY DECRYING ALL THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BEFORE THEM
AND AFTER SUCH A MANNER AS TO SATISFY ITSELF CONCERNING EVERY PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WHICH MAY BE WHEN I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF ONE BODY UPON ANOTHER IN ANY SITUATION
OR THOSE OF SOUNDS WHICH ARE CONVEYED BY THE HEARING ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME RESEMBLING NOW IF THIS BE TRUE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS IT MUST BE NO LESS SO
OF VIRTUE AND VICE IN GENERAL
WHO HAVE BEGUN TO PUT THE SCIENCE OF MAN ON A NEW FOOTING AND HAVE ENGAGED THE ATTENTION AND EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF THE PUBLIC SO TRUE IT IS THAT HOWEVER OTHER NATIONS MAY RIVAL US IN POETRY
I CAN FORM SUCH AN IDEA OF THAT CITY AS WILL PERFECTLY REPRESENT ALL ITS STREETS AND HOUSES IN THEIR REAL AND JUST PROPORTIONS I PERCEIVE THEREFORE
AND HAVE A JUST VALUE FOR EVERY OTHER PART OF LITERATURE BY METAPHYSICAL REASONINGS THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THOSE ON ANY PARTICULAR BRANCH OF SCIENCE BUT EVERY KIND OF ARGUMENT WHICH IS ANY WAY ABSTRUSE
NOR IS THERE REQUIRED SUCH PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE TO DISCOVER THE PRESENT IMPERFECT CONDITION OF THE SCIENCES BUT EVEN THE RABBLE WITHOUT DOORS MAY JUDGE FROM THE NOISE AND CLAMOUR WHICH THEY HEAR
RULES BY WHICH TO JUDGE OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS
THESE ARE EVERY WHERE TO BE MET WITH IN THE SYSTEMS OF THE MOST EMINENT PHILOSOPHERS AND SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN DISGRACE UPON PHILOSOPHY ITSELF
OF IMPOSING THEIR CONJECTURES AND HYPOTHESES ON THE WORLD FOR THE MOST CERTAIN PRINCIPLES WHEN THIS MUTUAL CONTENTMENT AND SATISFACTION CAN BE OBTAINED BETWIXT THE MASTER AND SCHOLAR
WHICH MAY PROVE THAT IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR IDEAS TO GO BEFORE THEIR CORRESPONDENT IMPRESSIONS I BELIEVE IT WILL READILY BE ALLOWED THAT THE SEVERAL DISTINCT IDEAS OF COLOURS WHICH ENTER BY THE EYES
WE MAY EXTEND OUR CONQUESTS OVER ALL THOSE SCIENCES WHICH MORE INTIMATELY CONCERN HUMAN LIFE AND MAY AFTERWARDS PROCEED AT LEISURE TO DISCOVER MORE FULLY
AND ARE JUDGED OF BY THEIR POWERS AND FACULTIES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS WE MIGHT MAKE IN THESE SCIENCES WERE WE THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTENT AND FORCE OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
TO ACCURATE AND PROFOUND REASONING PRINCIPLES TAKEN UPON TRUST CONSEQUENCES LAMELY DEDUCED FROM THEM WANT OF COHERENCE IN THE PARTS AND OF EVIDENCE IN THE WHOLE
AND THAT HOWEVER WIDE ANY OF THEM MAY SEEM TO RUN FROM IT THEY STILL RETURN BACK BY ONE PASSAGE OR ANOTHER EVEN MATHEMATICS NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND NATURAL RELIGION ARE IN SOME MEASURE DEPENDENT ON THE SCIENCE OF MAN
I FIRST MAKE MYSELF CERTAIN BY A NEW REVIEW OF WHAT I HAVE ALREADY ASSERTED THAT EVERY SIMPLE IMPRESSION IS ATTENDED WITH A CORRESPONDENT IDEA AND EVERY SIMPLE IDEA
MORAL DISTINCTIONS NOT DERIVED FROM REASON
IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE READER SO THE WRITER MAY DERIVE A MORE DELICATE SATISFACTION FROM THE FREE CONFESSION OF HIS IGNORANCE AND FROM HIS PRUDENCE IN AVOIDING THAT ERROR INTO WHICH SO MANY HAVE FALLEN
BUT AS THE FIRST IDEAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DERIVED FROM IMPRESSIONS IT STILL REMAINS TRUE THAT ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS PROCEED EITHER MEDIATELY
AS IT IS NOT CONTENT WITH INSTRUCTING US IN THE NATURE OF SUPERIOR POWERS BUT CARRIES ITS VIEWS FARTHER TO THEIR DISPOSITION TOWARDS US AND OUR DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY
ALWAYS GOOD NATURED HE MADE A HOST OF FRIENDS BOTH IN THE PROFESSION AND OUT OF IT AFTER YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL WORK HE SETTLED DOWN AS LANDLORD OF A PUBLIC HOUSE IN ENGLAND
IS NOT SO MUCH THE FAMOUS GEORGIA GIRL WITH HER MYSTERIOUS MUSCLE AS IS THE AUDIENCE WHICH GATHERS TO WONDER AT HER PERFORMANCE IT IS A PHENOMENON OF STUPIDITY
HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT HE WAS BEREFT OF HIS ENORMOUS STRENGTH AND THOSE ABOUT HIM HUMORED HIM
BOASTING THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW REALLY EXPERT SLEIGHT OF HAND MAGICIANS OF THE WORLD I MET WEYER AT LIEGE BELGIUM WHERE WE HAD AN ALL NIGHT MATCH WITH PLAYING CARDS
EVIDENTLY A CERTAIN VERTICAL COMPONENT THAT TENDS TO CAUSE THE STICK TO DESCEND
THE SAME GENERAL PRINCIPLES SHOWN HERE BEING USED THROUGHOUT HER PERFORMANCE THESE EXPLANATIONS ARE TAKEN FROM THE FRENCH PERIODICAL LA NATURE
WHEN MY OPENING ADDED A THIRD SENSATIONAL SURPRISE ONE OF THE LONDON DAILIES ASKED
HE DIED ALMOST FORGOTTEN EXCEPT BY HIS BROTHER ARTISTS BUT THEY MYSELF AMONG THEM BUILT A MONUMENT TO THIS GOOD NATURED HERCULES WHOSE ONLY CARE WAS TO ENTERTAIN
BY TAKING THE KNEES AS POINTS OF SUPPORT FOR HER ELBOWS AS SOON AS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT IS EFFECTED THE HARDEST PART OF THE WORK IS OVER FOR IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR THE GIRL TO CEASE
A DISCLOSURE OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED IN A FEW OF HER TESTS
THE ONE AMONG THESE WHO DESERVES FIRST MENTION IS CHARLES JEFFERSON WITH WHOSE ACHIEVEMENTS I BECAME QUITE FAMILIAR WHILE WE WERE WORKING IN THE SAME MUSEUM MANY YEARS AGO
THE OTHER APEX OF THE TRIANGLE BEING A CIRCUS GRAFTER WHO SHIBBOLETHED AT SOME OF THE BRACE GAMES
THE GIRL FORCES BACK TWO OR THREE MEN WHO IN UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM AND UNDER THE OBLIQUE ACTION OF THE THRUST EXERTED ARE OBLIGED TO FALL BACK THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT IS SO ELEMENTARY AND INFANTILE
ONE WAS PICKING UP A HEAVY BLACKSMITH'S ANVIL BY THE HORN AND PLACING IT ON A KITCHEN TABLE FOR THE OTHER HE HAD A BLOCK OF STEEL WHICH AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN INCHES LONG
TWELVE INCHES WIDE AND SEVEN INCHES THICK THIS BLOCK LAY ON THE FLOOR AND HIS CHALLENGE WAS FOR ANYONE TO PICK IT UP WITH BARE HANDS I NOTICED THAT IT REQUIRED UNUSUALLY LONG FINGERS TO GRASP IT
IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE DEXTERITY TO MOVE THE SUBJECT ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITHOUT A GREAT EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY THE DIFFICULTY IS NOT INCREASED ON SEATING TWO MEN OR THREE MEN
AND THE WHOLE REPERTOIRE OF THE SO CALLED HUMAN OSTRICH STEADILY DECLINED AND I RECALL ONLY ONE ENGAGEMENT OF A PERFORMER OF THIS TYPE AT A FIRST CLASS THEATER IN THIS COUNTRY DURING THE PRESENT GENERATION AND THAT DATE WAS NOT PLAYED
THAT THEY WERE GUNNING FOR ME IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT THE SAME NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATOR WHO EXPOSED THE MAGNET CAME UPON THE STAGE OF THE ALHAMBRA AT MY PRESS PERFORMANCE THE SAME STAGE WHERE THE UNHAPPY DIXIE LODE STONE HAD COLLAPSED AND THOUGH HE
A POWERFULLY BUILT ENGRAVER CONNECTED WITH THE CENTURY MAGAZINE MISTER JOHNSON HAD EVIDENTLY CAUGHT HER SECRET
CHAPTER TWELVE CONTEMPORARY STRONG PEOPLE CHARLES JEFFERSON LOUIS CYR JOHN GRUN MARX
THE TWO MEN ARE REQUESTED TO HOLD THE STICK FIRMLY AND IMMOVABLE BUT THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE UPON THE EXTREMITY SUFFICES TO MOVE THE ARMS AND BODY OF THE SUBJECT SUCH PRESSURE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS EXERTED BUT SLIGHTLY
THE DATA FURNISHED BY MISTER PERRY AS WELL AS THOSE RESULTING FROM OUR OWN OBSERVATIONS ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTS CONSISTS IN HAVING A MAN OR SEVERAL MEN
AND IN THAT POSITION PUSH A NAIL THROUGH A ONE INCH BOARD HELD PERPENDICULARLY IN A METAL FRAME I SAW NO CHANCE FOR TRICKERY IN LE ROY'S ACT
THIS MAN WOULD ALLOW A STRONG LEATHER STRAP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TRUNK STRAP TO BE BUCKLED ROUND HIS CHEST AND THEN INFLATING HIS LUNGS WOULD BREAK IT WITH VERY LITTLE APPARENT EXERTION
MEXICAN BILLY WELLS A FOOLHARDY ITALIAN WILSON HERMAN SAMPSON SANDOW YUCCA LA BLANCHE LULU HURST
CREATED A VERITABLE SENSATION A GENERATION AGO BY A SERIES OF FEATS
WHERE IT CONCERNS THE EASY LIFTING OF A VERY HEAVY PERSON THE TRICK IS NO LESS SIMPLE
MISS PRICE WAS A MARVELOUS PERFORMER BUT WITHOUT HER HUSBAND LECTURER SHE WAS NO LONGER A DRAWING CARD AND DROPPED TO THE LEVEL OF AN ORDINARY ENTERTAINER EVEN LOWER
A FEW OF THE ACTS HAD SUFFICIENT INTRINSIC WORTH TO FOLLOW THE MANAGERS INTO VAUDEVILLE BUT THESE HAVE NO PART IN THIS CHRONICLE
THE INORDINATE STRENGTH OF HIS JAWS TEETH AND NECK ENABLED HIM TO PUSH A NAIL HELD BETWEEN HIS TEETH THROUGH A ONE INCH BOARD OR TO NAIL TOGETHER WITH HIS TEETH TWO THREE QUARTERS INCH BOARDS
CREATED A DEMAND FOR FREAKS THAT WAS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE SUPPLY AND MANY HOUSES WERE OBLIGED TO CLOSE BECAUSE NO FREAKS WERE OBTAINABLE EVEN AT THE ENORMOUS INCREASE IN SALARIES THEN IN VOGUE THE SMALL PRICE OF ADMISSION AND THE FACT THAT
ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS REQUIRE SOME LITTLE SKILL AND PRACTICE BUT ARE ATTENDED WITH NO DIFFICULTY AND UPON THE WHOLE DO NOT MERIT THE ENTHUSIASTIC ARTICLES THAT HAVE GIVEN THE ELECTRIC OR MAGNETIC GIRL HER EUROPEAN REPUTATION
THE MAGNET FAILED TO ATTRACT AFTER ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS FOR A KEEN WITTED REPORTER DISCOVERED HER METHODS AND PROMPTLY PUBLISHED THEM THE BULLET DETAINER ALSO LASTED ONLY A SHORT TIME ONLY
REVIEWING ONE OF LULU HURST'S PERFORMANCES THE NEW YORK TIMES OF JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SAID THE PHENOMENON OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHICH MAY BE SEEN NIGHTLY AT WALLACK'S
FATHER IS READY TO BURST WITH RAGE DO LET ME FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR HOME OH I'LL BE BOUND
ONLY LET ME BE WITH YOU FOR IF I STAY HERE ANY LONGER MY FATHER WILL BE SURE TO TAKE MY LIFE SO SHE GOT LEAVE TO BE WITH THE BEGGAR AS SHE CALLED HIM AND THEY WALKED A LONG LONG WAY
NO IT ISN'T FOR SALE SAID HACON GRIZZLEBEARD BUT IF I MAY HAVE LEAVE TO SLEEP OUTSIDE YOUR BEDROOM DOOR TO NIGHT I'LL GIVE IT YOU WELL THE PRINCESS THOUGHT IT A GOOD BARGAIN THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN LETTING HIM SLEEP OUTSIDE HER DOOR
GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS GUDBRAND HE HAD A FARM WHICH LAY FAR FAR AWAY UPON A HILL SIDE AND SO THEY CALLED HIM GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE NOW
YOU KNOW WE LIVE ON SHORT COMMONS BUT TAKE CARE THAT THE PRINCE DOESN'T SEE YOU FOR HE HAS EYES AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO WHEN SHE WAS WELL ON HER WAY HACON RAN BY A SHORT CUT AND REACHED THE PALACE LONG BEFORE HER
WELL SAID THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE HOW DID THINGS GO WITH YOU IN TOWN RATHER SO SO SAID GUDBRAND I CAN'T PRAISE MY LUCK NOR DO I BLAME IT EITHER AND WITH THAT HE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY FROM FIRST TO LAST
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH A SHEEP I HAVE NO SPINNING WHEEL NOR CARDING COMB NOR SHOULD I CARE TO WORRY MYSELF WITH CUTTING AND SHAPING AND SEWING CLOTHES
BUT I HAVEN'T THE GOOSE EITHER FOR WHEN I HAD GONE A BIT FARTHER I SWOPPED IT AWAY FOR A COCK DEAR ME CRIED HIS WIFE HOW YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING JUST AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE MYSELF A COCK
THE PRINCE SAID YOU WERE TO COME AND TRY YOUR HAND AT BAKING I BAKE SAID THE PRINCESS I CAN'T BAKE FOR I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE WELL YOU MUST GO SAID HACON SINCE THE PRINCE HAS SAID IT
THE KEEN NORTH WIND THAT BLOWS HERE HAS TAKEN THE EARS OFF ONE OF YOUR HORSES AND THE OTHER HAS STOOD BY AND GAPED AT WHAT WAS GOING ON TILL HIS JAWS HAVE SPLIT RIGHT UP TO HIS EARS AND WITH THAT SHE BURST OUT INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER RAN IN SLAMMED TO THE DOOR
RUN OUT CHILD AND PUT UP THE GOOSE
ALL OVER AND WHEN HE FOUND THE BREAD HE WAS IN A GREAT RAGE AND LED THEM ALL A SAD LIFE SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND BEWAIL AND SAID THE BEGGAR MADE ME DO IT AND I COULDN'T HELP IT
WHILE THE MAN WENT IN TO SEE HIS WIFE GOOD EVENING SAID GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE GOOD EVENING SAID THE GOODWIFE OH IS THAT YOU NOW GOD BE PRAISED YES IT WAS HE
AND STOOD IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS ROYAL ROBES BEFORE SHE CAME IN SO THE PRINCESS STOOD BY WHEN THE PIG WAS KILLED AND MADE SAUSAGES WITH THE REST AND DID AS HACON BADE HER AND STUFFED HER POCKETS FULL OF SAUSAGES BUT WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO GO HOME AT EVEN THE PRINCE SAID
AND THEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO WALK ABOUT LIKE A BEGGAR'S WIFE SO WHENEVER THEY CAME TO GRAND CASTLES AND WOODS AND PARKS AND SHE ASKED WHOSE THEY WERE THE BEGGAR'S ANSWER WAS STILL THE SAME OH
TO FEED AND LITTER AND WATER TWO WELL GUDBRAND THOUGHT HIS WIFE TALKED RIGHT GOOD SENSE
SOMETIME AFTER HACON CAME HOME TO THE CABIN AT EVEN AND SAID
HUSH HUSH BE STILL FOR GOD'S SAKE SAID THE PRINCESS IF FATHER KNOWS THERE IS A MAN IN HERE I SHALL BE IN A SAD PLIGHT I'M SURE HE'LL KILL ME ON THE SPOT HUTETUTETUTETU LET ME GET INTO BED SAID HACON GRIZZLEBEARD
AND LET HIM DRIVE OFF SO HE DROVE HOME BUT AS HE WENT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD PAY HER OFF ONE DAY AFTER A BIT HE PUT ON A GREAT BEARD OF MOSS THREW A GREAT FUR CLOAK OVER HIS CLOTHES AND DRESSED HIMSELF UP JUST LIKE ANY BEGGAR
WHO KEPT ON SHIVERING SO THAT THE WHOLE ROOM SHOOK WELL THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT SHE HAD TO LET HIM GET INTO BED WHERE HE SLEPT BOTH SOUND AND SOFT BUT A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD A CHILD AT WHICH
SO THE TAILOR CAN'T MEASURE HER FOR HER WEDDING GOWN AND THE PRINCE'S WILL IS THAT YOU SHOULD GO UP TO THE PALACE AND BE MEASURED INSTEAD OF THE BRIDE FOR HE SAYS YOU ARE JUST THE SAME HEIGHT AND SHAPE BUT AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN MEASURED MIND YOU DON'T GO AWAY
AND PUT UP THE COCK BUT AFTER ALL I HAVEN'T GOT THE COCK SAID GUDBRAND FOR WHEN I HAD GONE A BIT FARTHER
FOR IT WASN'T QUITE IN ORDER AND BESIDES IT WANTED A STAND SO WHEN THE PRINCESS ROSE UP IN THE MORNING SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND THREW IT UP AND CALLED OUT TO THE BEGGAR IF HE WOULD SELL HIS GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL
YOU DID JUST AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE MYSELF A THOUSAND THANKS NOW I CAN HAVE A BIT OF BACON IN THE HOUSE TO SET BEFORE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME TO SEE ME THAT I CAN WHAT DO WE WANT WITH A HORSE
HE WENT TO A GOLDSMITH AND BOUGHT A GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL AND SAT DOWN WITH IT UNDER THE PRINCESS WINDOW AND BEGAN TO FILE AWAY AT HIS SPINNING WHEEL
SO IT WENT NOW JUST AS IT HAD GONE BEFORE AND WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE CABIN THE BEGGAR WAS THERE BEFORE HER OH HEAVEN HELP ME SHE SAID YOU WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME AT LAST BY MAKING ME NOTHING BUT WHAT IS WICKED
OH ONLY THE STAND TO THAT SPINNING WHEEL WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS BOUGHT FOR I THOUGHT AS YOU HAD THE WHEEL YOU MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE THE STAND TOO WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR IT ASKED THE PRINCESS BUT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE ANY MORE THAN THE WHEEL
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT SHE HAD TO GIVE HIM LEAVE LEST THE KING SHOULD HEAR THE NOISE HE MADE SO HACON GRIZZLEBEARD LAY ALONGSIDE THE PRINCESS BED AND SLEPT LIKE A TOP IT WAS A LONG WHILE BEFORE HACON GRIZZLEBEARD CAME AGAIN
AND THE ROAD IS NO FARTHER OUT THAN IN AND WITH THAT HE BEGAN TO TODDLE HOME WITH HIS COW BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A BIT OF THE WAY A MAN MET HIM WHO HAD A HORSE TO SELL SO GUDBRAND THOUGHT TWAS BETTER TO HAVE A HORSE THAN A COW SO HE SWOPPED WITH THE MAN
YOU CAN STAND ABOUT YOU KNOW AND WHEN THE TAILOR CUTS OUT THE GOWN YOU CAN SNAP UP THE LARGEST PIECES
NO IF I HAVE A SHEEP
EVERYONE HAS LEFT MOSCOW AND THE PEOPLE ARE RIOTING HOW IS IT THAT WE ARE STAYING ON ON THE CONTRARY THINGS SEEM SATISFACTORY MA COUSINE SAID PIERRE IN THE BANTERING TONE HE HABITUALLY ADOPTED TOWARD HER ALWAYS FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE ROLE OF HER BENEFACTOR
BY CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KOLOCHA TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THE WHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTITSA
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED SAID PIERRE EVERYTHING IS QUIET IN THE CITY AND THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER SEE I'VE JUST BEEN READING HE SHOWED HER THE BROADSHEET
MEEK AND FLUSTERED VOICES HERE AND THERE WERE HEARD CALLING
THANKED HIM WITH THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE RADIANT WITH GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO HER CERTAIN THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS AND OF THE FRENCH
WHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTE ANGLE SO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVARDINO
ALL OUR STUPIDITY YAKOV ALPATYCH CAME THE ANSWERS AND THE CROWD BEGAN AT ONCE TO DISPERSE THROUGH THE VILLAGE THE TWO BOUND MEN WERE LED OFF TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE THE TWO DRUNKEN PEASANTS FOLLOWED THEM AYE WHEN I LOOK AT YOU SAID ONE OF THEM TO KARP
BE OFF TO YOUR HOUSES AT ONCE AND DON'T LET ONE OF YOUR VOICES BE HEARD WHY WE'VE NOT DONE ANY HARM WE DID IT JUST OUT OF FOOLISHNESS IT'S ALL NONSENSE I SAID THEN THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER VOICES WERE HEARD BICKERING WITH ONE ANOTHER
OH THAT COUNT OF YOURS SAID THE PRINCESS MALEVOLENTLY HE IS A HYPOCRITE A RASCAL WHO HAS HIMSELF ROUSED THE PEOPLE TO RIOT DIDN'T HE WRITE IN THOSE IDIOTIC BROADSHEETS THAT ANYONE WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE SHOULD BE DRAGGED TO THE LOCKUP BY HIS HAIR HOW SILLY
STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY
SHOUTED ROSTOV COMING UP TO THE CROWD WITH QUICK STEPS THE ELDER
THAT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM THE STOUT MAN ROSE FROWNED SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND EVIDENTLY TRYING TO APPEAR FIRM BEGAN TO PULL ON HIS JACKET WITHOUT LOOKING ABOUT HIM BUT SUDDENLY HIS LIPS TREMBLED AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
TWO HOURS LATER THE CARTS WERE STANDING IN THE COURTYARD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO HOUSE THE PEASANTS WERE BRISKLY CARRYING OUT THE PROPRIETOR'S GOODS AND PACKING THEM ON THE CARTS AND DRON LIBERATED AT PRINCESS MARY'S WISH FROM THE CUPBOARD WHERE HE HAD BEEN CONFINED
IF THIS PATIENCE COMES OUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AFTER SHUFFLING THE CARDS HOLDING THEM IN HIS HAND AND LIFTING HIS HEAD IF IT COMES OUT IT MEANS WHAT DOES IT MEAN HE HAD NOT DECIDED WHAT IT SHOULD MEAN WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE ELDEST PRINCESS
AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON
AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVING TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED
UNWILLING TO OBTRUDE HIMSELF ON THE PRINCESS ROSTOV DID NOT GO BACK TO THE HOUSE BUT REMAINED IN THE VILLAGE AWAITING HER DEPARTURE WHEN HER CARRIAGE DROVE OUT OF THE HOUSE HE MOUNTED AND ACCOMPANIED HER EIGHT MILES FROM BOGUCHAROVO TO WHERE THE ROAD WAS OCCUPIED BY OUR TROOPS
EVERYWHERE IN MOZHAYSK AND BEYOND IT TROOPS WERE STATIONED OR ON THE MARCH COSSACKS FOOT AND HORSE SOLDIERS WAGONS CAISSONS AND CANNON WERE EVERYWHERE
MORE THAN ONCE NOTICED THAT HER MISTRESS LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SMILED AT SOMETHING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MINGLED JOY AND SORROW WELL SUPPOSING I DO LOVE HIM THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY ASHAMED AS SHE WAS OF ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO
WAS STANDING IN THE YARD DIRECTING THE MEN DON'T PUT IT IN SO CARELESSLY SAID ONE OF THE PEASANTS
SHOUTED ROSTOV AS IF THAT ORDER TOO COULD NOT POSSIBLY MEET WITH ANY OPPOSITION AND IN FACT TWO MORE PEASANTS BEGAN BINDING DRON WHO TOOK OFF HIS OWN BELT AND HANDED IT TO THEM AS IF TO AID THEM AND YOU ALL LISTEN TO ME SAID ROSTOV TO THE PEASANTS
AND HONOR AND GLORY TO WHOEVER CAPTURES HIM HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT HIS CAJOLERY HAS BROUGHT US TO BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME THE MOB NEAR KILLED HER BECAUSE SHE SAID SOMETHING IN FRENCH OH BUT IT'S SO YOU
LAVRUSHKA HOWEVER RAN UP TO KARP AND SEIZED HIM BY THE ARMS FROM BEHIND SHALL I CALL UP OUR MEN FROM BEYOND THE HILL HE CALLED OUT
SAID HE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME AND WISHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
SOMETIMES WHEN SHE RECALLED HIS LOOKS HIS SYMPATHY AND HIS WORDS HAPPINESS DID NOT APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO HER IT WAS AT THOSE MOMENTS THAT DUNYASHA NOTICED HER SMILING AS SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAS IT NOT FATE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO BOGUCHAROVO AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY
YOU KNOW IT HAS COST MONEY HOW CAN YOU CHUCK IT IN LIKE THAT OR SHOVE IT UNDER THE CORD WHERE IT'LL GET RUBBED I DON'T LIKE THAT WAY OF DOING THINGS LET IT ALL BE DONE PROPERLY ACCORDING TO RULE
AND ON THE TWENTY SIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO SO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELF
HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSE MILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND ARE MEANINGLESS ON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE PRECEDING BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO WERE FOUGHT
OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVED AND INVOLUNTARY THE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISH THE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY
WHEN PIERRE RETURNED HOME HE WAS HANDED TWO OF ROSTOPCHIN'S BROADSHEETS THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT THAT DAY
WERE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE A COMMON CAUSE THE SPRING AND THAT IF WE SEE THE BRANCHES ON SOME TREES SHOOTING AND TURNING GREEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT WILL SOON BE SO WITH ALL
THEY ARE THE MEN WHOSE PRAISES ARE CELEBRATED IN POETRY WHO ARE HONORED BY SCULPTURE AND RECEIVED WITH TRIUMPHANT JUBILATIONS THE BEST MEN OF OUR DAY ARE ALL STRIVING FOR SUCH PLACES OF HONOR CONSEQUENTLY
TO MAKE A QUEEN OF INDIA RUBBER AND WHAT GOOD TO US ARE THESE ARMIES WITH THEIR GENERALS AND BANDS AND HORSES AND DRUMS AND WHAT NEED IS THERE OF THEM WHEN THERE IS NO WAR AND NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE WAR
THE VICAR GAVE HIS DECISION IN FAVOUR OF DON CLAVIJO AND SHE WAS DELIVERED OVER TO HIM AS HIS LAWFUL WIFE
WITH HOODS OF FINE WHITE GAUZE SO LONG THAT THEY ALLOWED ONLY THE BORDER OF THE ROBE TO BE SEEN BEHIND THEM CAME THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI THE SQUIRE TRIFALDIN OF THE WHITE BEARD LEADING HER BY THE HAND CLAD IN THE FINEST UNNAPPED BLACK BAIZE SUCH THAT
IT IS TRUE THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY REMAINS IN ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES JUST AS MUCH AN ORGANIZATION BASED ON VIOLENCE AS IT WAS ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND EVEN IN SOME RESPECTS ESPECIALLY IN THE PREPARATION FOR WAR AND IN WAR ITSELF
UNLESS THE ENVIOUS FATES AND HARD HEARTED SISTERS THREE HAVE CUT FOR HER THE THREAD OF LIFE BUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT FOR HEAVEN WILL NOT SUFFER SO GREAT A WRONG TO EARTH AS IT WOULD BE TO PLUCK UNRIPE THE GRAPES OF THE FAIREST VINEYARD ON ITS SURFACE
AGAIN WOE IS ME HAPLESS THAT I AM IT WAS NOT VERSES THAT CONQUERED ME BUT MY OWN SIMPLICITY IT WAS NOT MUSIC MADE ME YIELD BUT MY OWN IMPRUDENCE
AND THAT CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE QUITE SENSELESS BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENTS DO NOT ATTAIN THE OBJECTS AIMED AT BY THE JUDGES THEMSELVES THESE INSTITUTIONS THEREFORE SERVE NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR MEN WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE USEFUL
AND ARE NOT WILLING TO FIRE ON MEN EITHER OF THEIR OWN OR A FOREIGN COUNTRY JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS
WHICH CANNOT BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE THE SAME GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AND CANNONS AND FORTRESSES AND REVIEWS AND MANEUVERS BUT NO WAR BREAKS OUT ONE YEAR TEN TWENTY YEARS PASS BY
THE BEST OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE AGE WHEN THEY ARE STILL UNCORRUPTED BY LIFE AND ARE CHOOSING A CAREER PREFER THE CALLING OF DOCTOR ENGINEER TEACHER ARTIST
INTO A HORRIBLE CROCODILE OF SOME UNKNOWN METAL WHILE BETWEEN THE TWO THERE STANDS A PILLAR ALSO OF METAL WITH CERTAIN CHARACTERS IN THE SYRIAC LANGUAGE INSCRIBED UPON IT WHICH BEING TRANSLATED INTO KANDIAN AND NOW INTO CASTILIAN
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE COUNTESS ZORRUNA AS IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THOSE PARTS FOR LORDS TO TAKE DISTINCTIVE TITLES FROM THE THING OR THINGS MOST ABUNDANT IN THEIR DOMINIONS THIS COUNTESS HOWEVER IN HONOUR OF THE NEW FASHION OF HER SKIRT
THAT MY MOST MISERABLE MISERY WILL BE ACCORDED A RECEPTION NO LESS DISPASSIONATE THAN GENEROUS AND CONDOLENT IN YOUR MOST VALIANT BOSOMS FOR IT IS ONE THAT IS ENOUGH TO MELT MARBLE SOFTEN DIAMONDS AND MOLLIFY THE STEEL OF THE MOST HARDENED HEARTS IN THE WORLD
AND GIFTS AND GRACES OF THIS KIND ARE ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN A MOUNTAIN NOT TO SAY A TENDER YOUNG GIRL
THE SAME PRIESTS AND ARCHBISHOPS AND CHURCHES AND SYNODS BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THEY HAVE LONG AGO CEASED TO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY PREACH AND THEREFORE THEY CAN CONVINCE NO ONE OF THE NECESSITY OF BELIEVING WHAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEMSELVES
THOU ART RIGHT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR WITH A KNIGHT ERRANT IF HE HAS BUT TWO FINGERS BREADTH OF GOOD FORTUNE
AND THEN WHEN THEY CONDESCEND TO COMPOSE A SORT OF VERSE THAT WAS AT THAT TIME IN VOGUE IN KANDY WHICH THEY CALL SEGUIDILLAS
FOR IN MY COUNTRY SKIRTS OR TAILS TAILS OR SKIRTS IT'S ALL ONE HUSH FRIEND SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE SINCE THIS LADY DUENNA COMES IN QUEST OF ME FROM SUCH A DISTANT LAND SHE CANNOT BE ONE OF THOSE THE APOTHECARY MEANT MOREOVER
TO THIS SANCHO MADE ANSWER AS TO MY GOODNESS SENORA BEING AS LONG AND AS GREAT AS YOUR SQUIRE'S BEARD IT MATTERS VERY LITTLE TO ME MAY I HAVE MY SOUL WELL BEARDED AND MOUSTACHED WHEN IT COMES TO QUIT THIS LIFE THAT'S THE POINT
THE PANZA IS HERE SAID SANCHO BEFORE ANYONE COULD REPLY AND DON QUIXOTISSIMUS TOO AND SO MOST DISTRESSEDEST DUENISSIMA YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU WILLISSIMUS
THAT HE PLAYED THE GUITAR SO AS TO MAKE IT SPEAK AND HE WAS BESIDES A POET AND A GREAT DANCER AND HE COULD MAKE BIRDCAGES SO WELL THAT BY MAKING THEM ALONE HE MIGHT HAVE GAINED A LIVELIHOOD HAD HE FOUND HIMSELF REDUCED TO UTTER POVERTY
IT IS MY OPINION YOU SHOULD NOT STIR A STEP WHO BADE THEE MEDDLE IN THIS SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE WHO SENOR SAID SANCHO I MEDDLE FOR I HAVE A RIGHT TO MEDDLE AS A SQUIRE WHO HAS LEARNED THE RULES OF COURTESY IN THE SCHOOL OF YOUR WORSHIP
AND BETWEEN THEMSELVES THEY COMMENDED THE CLEVER ACTING OF THE TRIFALDI WHO RETURNING TO HER SEAT SAID
BUT TO MARRY SUCH AN ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN AS HAS BEEN JUST NOW DESCRIBED TO US INDEED INDEED THOUGH IT WAS A FOLLY IT WAS NOT SUCH A GREAT ONE AS YOU THINK FOR ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MY MASTER HERE AND
HE SAID HE WOULD NOT VISIT US WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT WITH OTHERS OF A SLOW NATURE WHICH WOULD BE IN EFFECT CIVIL DEATH FOR EVER AND THE VERY INSTANT HE CEASED SPEAKING
PARADOXES OF THAT SORT WHICH THEIR WRITINGS ARE FULL OF
DON CLAVIJO BEING A
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED HER INTELLIGENCE WAS CHILDISH SHE WAS AS INTELLIGENT AS SHE WAS FAIR AND SHE WAS FAIRER THAN ALL THE WORLD AND IS SO STILL
THERE ARE THE SAME DIPLOMATS AND THE SAME DELIBERATIONS ON ALLIANCES AND WARS THERE ARE STILL THE SAME PARLIAMENTS WITH THE SAME DEBATES ON THE EASTERN QUESTION AND AFRICA ON TREATIES AND VIOLATIONS OF TREATIES AND HOME RULE
I WILL SEND YOU THERE TO BE QUEEN MEANWHILE I WILL GIVE YOU AN APARTMENT IN MY PALACE WHERE YOU WILL BE TREATED WITH ALL HONOUR AT THIS THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN TOOK COURAGE
THAT NOUREDDIN HAD ALREADY GONE OUT MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE THE VIZIR'S WIFE ENTER IN TEARS THE PERSIAN ASKED WHAT MISFORTUNE HAD HAPPENED WHAT EXCLAIMED THE LADY YOU ASK ME THAT KNOWING THAT MY SON NOUREDDIN HAS BEEN ALONE WITH YOU
SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER THIS NOUREDDIN HAS RUN THROUGH HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE HAS SOLD ALL HIS POSSESSIONS AND IS NOW REDUCED TO SELLING THE SLAVE CALLING HIM TO ME I SAID NOUREDDIN I WILL GIVE YOU TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES FOR YOUR SLAVE WHOM I WILL PRESENT TO THE KING
AND WHEN SOON AFTER THAT NOUREDDIN PROPOSED TO HAVE SOME OF THE LUSTRES LIT HE ANSWERED
BUT HE DECLINED TO SHED THE BLOOD OF HIS ENEMY WHO WAS FORTHWITH HANDED OVER TO THE EXECUTIONER
THE OLD MAN FURIOUS AT THIS INSOLENCE AS HE CONSIDERED IT
WOULD RECEIVE THE BULK OF WHAT WAS LEFT AFTER EXISTING INTERESTS HAD BEEN AMPLY GUARANTEED THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT SO SAID THESE GENTLEMEN THAT AMPLE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF AN EPISCOPAL CHURCH
I HAVE HOWEVER TO WARN YOU OF ONE THING I HAVE A SON WHO THOUGH NOT WANTING IN SENSE IS YOUNG FOOLISH AND HEADSTRONG
WENT TO THE PRISON TO FETCH NOUREDDIN WHOM HE MOUNTED ON A WRETCHED HORSE WITHOUT A SADDLE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE SAOUY WENT IN TO THE KING LEAVING NOUREDDIN IN THE SQUARE
THE TIME FOR IT HAD CLEARLY GONE BY THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH WOULD OWN INCREASED POWER WHEN IT COULD APPOINT ITS OWN BISHOPS AND BE WHOLLY DISSEVERED FROM STATE PATRONAGE
NOUREDDIN ON BEING AWOKE TOLD THE OLD MAN THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND MERELY WISHED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE COME WITH ME SAID SCHEIH IBRAHIM I WILL LODGE YOU BETTER AND WILL SHOW YOU A MAGNIFICENT GARDEN BELONGING TO ME
WHILE SOME DECLARED
AND REFUSES TO STOP WHEN YOU BID HIM MISTER GRESHAM HAD BEEN VERY INDISCREET
KHACAN WHO WAS BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE OF HER MERITS THAN THE DEALER WISHING TO BRING THE MATTER TO A CONCLUSION SENT FOR THE MERCHANT AND SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF THAT I WISH TO BUY YOUR SLAVE
AND MISTER BOFFIN WAS THE HERO OF TEN MINUTES MISTER DAUBENY DETRACTED SOMETHING FROM THIS TRIUMPH BY THE OVERSTRAINED AND PERHAPS IRONIC PATHOS WITH WHICH HE DEPLORED THE LOSS OF HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND'S SERVICES
AND IMMEDIATELY GAVE HER THE NAME OF THE FAIR PERSIAN BEING A MAN OF GREAT WISDOM AND LEARNING
AND ASKED PERMISSION TO HOLD IT IN THE PAVILION I GRANTED HIS REQUEST BUT FORGOT SINCE TO MENTION IT TO YOUR MAJESTY GIAFAR
NOUREDDIN AND THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN FINDING THE WINE EXCELLENT DRANK OF IT FREELY AND WHILE DRINKING THEY SANG BOTH HAD FINE VOICES
AND TOOK THE CUP SHE OFFERED NOW THE OLD MAN ONLY MADE A PRETENCE OF RENOUNCING WINE
WHILE I DRESS MYSELF AS A CITIZEN GO AND DISGUISE YOURSELF AND THEN COME WITH ME WHEN THEY REACHED THE GARDEN GATE THEY FOUND IT OPEN TO THE GREAT INDIGNATION OF THE CALIPH THE DOOR OF THE PAVILION BEING ALSO OPEN
AND ALL THREE ATE TOGETHER WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING NOUREDDIN ASKED THE OLD MAN TO BRING THEM A BOTTLE OF WINE
ASTOUNDED THAT HE SHOULD WISH TO PART FROM HER TOOK HER LUTE AND WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SANG HER REPROACHES TO ITS MUSIC
SAYING THAT HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE ADMITTED TAKING EACH BY AN ARM HE PUT THEM OUT OF THE ANTEROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR THEN THEY RUSHED TO THE BATH INFORMING THEIR MISTRESS WITH SHRIEKS AND TEARS
AS TO THE ENDOWMENTS THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION OF IDEAS BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE WITH THEM INAPPROPRIATE TO RELIGION EDUCATION
THEY HAVE NOT EXPECTED RELIEF FROM THE HANDS OF GREEKS BUT WILL TAKE IT WHEN IT COMES FROM GREEKS OR TROJANS WHAT WOULD MISTER TURNBULL SAY IN THIS DEBATE AND WHAT MISTER MONK MISTER TURNBULL WAS THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE
THE PAINTINGS AND FURNITURE WERE OF ASTONISHING BEAUTY AND BETWEEN EACH WINDOW WAS A SILVER ARM HOLDING A CANDLE
WHO EASILY AVOIDED A MISSILE FROM THE HAND OF A DRUNKEN MAN IT HIT AGAINST THE WALL AND BROKE INTO A THOUSAND PIECES SCHEIH IBRAHIM STILL MORE ENRAGED THEN WENT OUT TO FETCH A STICK
SO SAYING SHE WEPT BITTERLY AND ALL HER SLAVES WEPT WITH HER KHACAN ENTERING SHORTLY AFTER THIS WAS MUCH ASTONISHED TO FIND HIS WIFE AND HER SLAVES IN TEARS
THAT HE HAD VOTED FOR THE PERMANENCE OF THE CHURCH ESTABLISHMENT AND HE MUST THEREFORE SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT THEN RATLER WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR I KNEW THE WAY HE'D RUN
HAD A SLAVE TO SELL WHOSE WIT AND WISDOM WERE EQUAL TO HER INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY
WHEN GRESHAM INSISTED ON POOR OLD MILDMAY'S TAKING HIM INTO THE CABINET THE WHOLE THING HAS GONE TO THE DOGS SAID BONTEEN ON THE FOURTH NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS DIVIDED
ONLY THE DOOR KEEPER LIVED THERE
HE GAVE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN AN APARTMENT NEAR TO THAT OF HIS WIFE WHOM HE CHARGED TO TREAT HER AS BEFITTING A LADY DESTINED FOR THE KING AND TO ORDER FOR HER THE MOST
KISSING HER HAND THE BEAUTIFUL SLAVE SAID MADAM I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU FIND ME IN THIS DRESS THAT YOU HAVE HAD PREPARED FOR ME YOUR WOMEN ASSURE ME THAT IT SUITS ME SO WELL THAT THEY HARDLY KNEW ME
WHAT SAID THE KING IS THAT WRETCH STILL ALIVE GO AND BEHEAD HIM AT ONCE I AUTHORISE YOU SIRE
BUT THIS THE KING REFUSED TO DO
BEARER OF THIS LETTER HAS GIVEN IT TO THEE AND THOU HAST READ IT TAKE OFF THY ROYAL MANTLE PUT IT ON HIS SHOULDERS AND SEAT HIM IN THY PLACE WITHOUT FAIL FAREWELL
HERE BILL TO A SERVANT CARRY THESE BUNDLES TO MISS ELSIE'S ROOM THEN PICKING HER UP HE TOSSED HER OVER HIS SHOULDER AND CARRIED HER UP STAIRS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A BABY SHE CLINGING TO HIM AND LAUGHING MERRILY
HE OPENED IT AND STOOPING TO GIVE HER A GOOD MORNING KISS SAID WITH A PLEASED SMILE HOW BRIGHT AND WELL MY DARLING LOOKS HAD YOU A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
SHE SOON COMPLETED HER TASK AND WENT OUT LEAVING THE TWO SITTING ON THE SOFA TOGETHER LAUGHING AND TALKING MERRILY WHILE AWAITING THE SUMMONS TO DINNER

EVERYTHING TO HER AS SHE IS FAST BECOMING TO ME I CANNOT FEEL SATISFIED AND YET I BELIEVE FEW DAUGHTERS LOVE THEIR FATHERS AS WELL AS SHE LOVES ME AND FONDLY PRESSING THE LITTLE HAND HE HELD HE LOOKED DOWN UPON HER WITH BEAMING EYES
YOU DIDN'T LIE AWAKE LOOKIN FOR DE MORNIN DID YOU
SHE WAS JUST READY FOR BED WHEN HER PAPA CAME IN AND TAKING HER IN HIS ARMS FOLDED HER TO HIS HEART SAYING MY OWN DARLING MY GOOD OBEDIENT LITTLE DAUGHTER

PLACING HER IN THE CARRIAGE SAID TO THE COACHMAN DRIVE CAREFULLY AJAX YOU ARE CARRYING MY GREATEST TREASURE NEBBER FEAR MARSTER
AND HAD TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE IN MAKING OUT A LIST OF SUCH ARTICLES AS SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE SUITABLE BUT ON EXAMINING HER PURSE SHE FOUND TO HER DISMAY THAT SHE HAD ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH ON THE MINIATURE AND VARIOUS GIFTS INTENDED FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
I DON'T EVEN MISS IT MYSELF ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT IS GONE
LONG SAID ADELAIDE IN A TONE OF SURPRISE YOU GENTLEMEN REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT AN UNDERTAKING IT IS TO SHOP WHY I THOUGHT WE GOT THROUGH IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME
WON'T YOU TAKE US PAPA I WISH I COULD MY DEAR BUT I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH MAKES IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE

HE OPENED HER WRITING DESK AS HE SPOKE AND TOOK OUT HER ACCOUNT BOOK OH PAPA SHE CRIED IN A STARTLED TONE SPRINGING FORWARD AND TAKING HOLD OF HIS HAND PLEASE PLEASE DON'T LOOK YOU KNOW YOU SAID I NEED NOT SHOW YOU UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS
HE SAID VERY GRAVELY HER FACE BRIGHTENED IN AN INSTANT NO PAPA SHE ANSWERED CHEERFULLY I WILL BE GOOD AND DO WHATEVER YOU BID ME

STUDYING AND RECITING TO HIM THEN THEY TOOK A LONG RIDE ON HORSEBACK AND WHEN THEY RETURNED SHE FOUND THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AMONG THEM WAS CAROLINE HOWARD A FAVORITE FRIEND OF ELSIE'S
HE WAS CONVERSING WITH A STRANGE GENTLEMAN AND HIS LITTLE GIRL STOOD QUIETLY AT HIS SIDE PATIENTLY WAITING UNTIL HE SHOULD BE READY TO GIVE HER HIS ATTENTION SHE HAD TO WAIT SOME MOMENTS FOR THE GENTLEMEN WERE DISCUSSING SOME POLITICAL QUESTION
INDEED IT DOES AND I FEEL RICHER IN THAT POSSESSION THAN ALL THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA COULD MAKE ME HE SAID PRESSING HER TO HIS HEART SHE LOOKED SURPASSINGLY LOVELY AT THAT MOMENT HER CHEEKS BURNING AND HER EYES SPARKLING WITH EXCITEMENT
A CHRISTMAS GIFT IS IT TO BE ASKED ELSIE

YOUR OLE MAMMY HOPES YOU WILL DARLIN REPLIED CHLOE HEARTILY AN
WHO HAD GONE UP TO THEM ONE OF THESE A NIMBLE LITTLE MAN WAS WEARING A BLUE COAT TIED ROUND THE WAIST WITH A ROPE HE HAD A NIGHTCAP ON HIS HEAD AND HIS FEET WERE BARE THE OTHER WHOSE APPEARANCE PARTICULARLY STRUCK PIERRE
AH HE LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE AN INCENDIARY REMARKED THE OFFICER AND ASK HIM WHO HE IS HE ADDED WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE INTERPRETER IN POOR RUSSIAN YOU MUST ANSWER THE CHIEF
OF REINFORCEMENTS NEEDED OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRIVING BACK THE RUSSIANS AND OF DISORGANIZATION AMONG HIS OWN TROOPS
LOOK HERE NO NONSENSE PIERRE WAS IN SUCH A TRANSPORT OF RAGE THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING AND HIS STRENGTH INCREASED TENFOLD HE RUSHED AT THE BAREFOOTED FRENCHMAN AND BEFORE THE LATTER HAD TIME TO DRAW HIS SWORD
THEY WENT INSIDE THE GARDEN WHEN THESE WOLVES SWOOPED DOWN SAID THE WOMAN POINTING TO THE FRENCH SOLDIERS O LORD HAVE MERCY ADDED THE DEACON
IN FORMER BATTLES HE HAD ONLY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESS BUT NOW INNUMERABLE UNLUCKY CHANCES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND HE EXPECTED THEM ALL YES IT WAS LIKE A DREAM IN WHICH A MAN FANCIES THAT A RUFFIAN IS COMING TO ATTACK HIM
THE TALES PASSING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH AT DIFFERENT ENDS OF THE ARMY DID NOT EVEN RESEMBLE WHAT KUTUZOV HAD SAID BUT THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS SPREAD EVERYWHERE BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID WAS NOT THE OUTCOME OF CUNNING CALCULATIONS BUT OF A FEELING THAT LAY IN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S SOUL
HAVING RUN THROUGH DIFFERENT YARDS AND SIDE STREETS PIERRE GOT BACK WITH HIS LITTLE BURDEN TO THE GRUZINSKI GARDEN AT THE CORNER OF THE POVARSKOY HE DID NOT AT FIRST RECOGNIZE THE PLACE FROM WHICH HE HAD SET OUT TO LOOK FOR THE CHILD SO CROWDED WAS IT NOW WITH PEOPLE AND GOODS
THAT'S WHAT IS CALLED PUTTING THINGS SQUARELY
THE GENERALS RE FORMED THEM BUT THEIR NUMBERS CONSTANTLY DECREASED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MURAT SENT HIS ADJUTANT TO NAPOLEON TO DEMAND REINFORCEMENTS NAPOLEON SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE KNOLL DRINKING PUNCH
NAPOLEON ROSE AND HAVING SUMMONED CAULAINCOURT
WHICH OF THE TWO BILIBIN WRINKLED UP THE SKIN OVER HIS EYEBROWS AND PONDERED WITH A SMILE ON HIS LIPS YOU ARE NOT TAKING ME UNAWARES YOU KNOW SAID HE AS A TRUE FRIEND I HAVE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR
STANDING NEAR NAPOLEON EXCHANGED LOOKS AND SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THIS GENERAL'S SENSELESS OFFER NAPOLEON BOWED HIS HEAD AND REMAINED SILENT A LONG TIME AT EIGHT HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM FRANCE I WILL NOT HAVE MY GUARD DESTROYED
WHO AS SHE IMAGINED LOVED HER VERY MUCH INFORMING HIM OF HER INTENTION TO MARRY N N AND OF HER HAVING EMBRACED THE ONE TRUE FAITH AND ASKING HIM TO CARRY OUT ALL THE FORMALITIES NECESSARY FOR A DIVORCE WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED TO HIM BY THE BEARER OF THE LETTER
BUT SIMPLY THAT THE UNFORTUNATE AND INTERESTING HELENE WAS IN DOUBT WHICH OF THE TWO MEN SHE SHOULD MARRY THE QUESTION WAS NO LONGER WHETHER THIS WAS POSSIBLE BUT ONLY WHICH WAS THE BETTER MATCH AND HOW THE MATTER WOULD BE REGARDED AT COURT
AND THE STAFF OFFICERS CONGRATULATED HIM KUTUZOV SMILED WAIT A LITTLE GENTLEMEN SAID HE THE BATTLE IS WON AND THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THE CAPTURE OF MURAT STILL IT IS BETTER TO WAIT BEFORE WE REJOICE
OF HER LONG BEAUTIFUL EXPRESSIONLESS FACE AMID THE SCATTERED PROPERTY AND THE CROWD ON THE OPEN SPACE SHE IN HER RICH SATIN CLOAK WITH A BRIGHT LILAC SHAWL ON HER HEAD SUGGESTED A DELICATE EXOTIC PLANT THROWN OUT ONTO THE SNOW
THAT BOTH THE PRINCE AND THE MAGNATE HAD PROPOSED TO HER AND THAT SHE LOVED BOTH AND WAS AFRAID OF GRIEVING EITHER A RUMOR IMMEDIATELY SPREAD IN PETERSBURG NOT THAT HELENE WANTED TO BE DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND HAD SUCH A REPORT SPREAD MANY WOULD HAVE OPPOSED SO ILLEGAL AN INTENTION
ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL OPINION WHICH HAD THAT DAY ORIGINATED AMONG THE HIGHER FRENCH OFFICERS WERE THE CAUSE OF THE CONFLAGRATIONS AFTER MARCHING THROUGH A NUMBER OF STREETS THE PATROL ARRESTED FIVE MORE RUSSIAN SUSPECTS A SMALL SHOPKEEPER TWO SEMINARY STUDENTS
AND THAT THE REAL COURSE OF THE BATTLE IS BETTER KNOWN TO ME THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAN TO HIM WOLZOGEN WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A REJOINDER BUT KUTUZOV INTERRUPTED HIM
IN THE HEAT OF A BATTLE IT IS EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE GO AND HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AND THEN COME BACK TO ME BEFORE BELLIARD WAS OUT OF SIGHT A MESSENGER FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE BATTLEFIELD GALLOPED UP NOW THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED NAPOLEON
NEAREST TO PIERRE STOOD THE POCKMARKED PEASANT WOMAN WITH THE LITTLE GIRL AND WHEN THE PATROL STARTED SHE MOVED FORWARD WHERE ARE THEY TAKING YOU TO YOU POOR DEAR SAID SHE AND THE LITTLE GIRL THE LITTLE GIRL
BUT THE EMPEROR TURNED FROM HIM TOOK A COUPLE OF STEPS STOPPED CAME BACK AND CALLED BERTHIER WE MUST GIVE RESERVES HE SAID MOVING HIS ARMS SLIGHTLY APART WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE SENT THERE HE ASKED OF BERTHIER WHOM HE SUBSEQUENTLY TERMED
HE LISTENED TO THE REPORTS THAT WERE BROUGHT HIM AND GAVE DIRECTIONS WHEN HIS SUBORDINATES DEMANDED THAT OF HIM
ADDRESSING A POCKMARKED PEASANT WOMAN LORD HAVE MERCY LORD HAVE MERCY HE ADDED IN HIS CUSTOMARY BASS THE ANFEROVS NO SAID THE WOMAN THEY LEFT IN THE MORNING THAT MUST BE EITHER MARY NIKOLIEVNA'S
WHO SAW IN THE PROJECT A DESECRATION OF THE SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE BUT THERE WERE NOT MANY SUCH AND THEY REMAINED SILENT WHILE THE MAJORITY WERE INTERESTED IN HELENE'S GOOD FORTUNE AND IN THE QUESTION WHICH MATCH WOULD BE THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
I WILL NOT TELL YOU WHO I AM I AM YOUR PRISONER TAKE ME PIERRE SUDDENLY REPLIED IN FRENCH AH AH MUTTERED THE OFFICER WITH A FROWN WELL THEN MARCH A CROWD HAD COLLECTED ROUND THE UHLANS
UNE MAITRESSE FEMME
THE FRENCH PATROL WAS ONE OF THOSE SENT OUT THROUGH THE VARIOUS STREETS OF MOSCOW BY DUROSNEL'S ORDER TO PUT A STOP TO THE PILLAGE
BUT NOW SOMETHING STRANGE WAS HAPPENING TO HIS TROOPS DESPITE NEWS OF THE CAPTURE OF THE FLECHES NAPOLEON SAW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE SAME NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS FORMER BATTLES

WEARY I TOSS AND THINK T IS ALMOST DAWN SO STILL THE STREETS BUT NOW THE LATEST TRAIN WHISTLING MELODIOUSLY COMES IN THE TRAMP OF FEET

ECHO FAR IN THE STILL NIGHT AIR NOW WITH JOY I FEEL MY EYELIDS DROOP ONCE MORE TO SLEEP AND DREAM IS BLISS UNSPEAKABLE I'M GOING OFF WHAT WAS I THINKING LAST
WITH HIS STEAMING LOAD HUMS LIKE THE HUMBLE BEE FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND THOUGHTS OF BREAKFAST RISE AND HARMONIES DOMESTIC SONG OF KETTLE AND HISSING URN GLAD VOICES AND THE SOUND OF HURRYING FEET
BUT DURING THE NIGHT ONE ESCAPED AND THE NEXT DAY ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS WITH MY WHOLE SQUADRON AT DIFFERENT TIMES THE ENGLISH HAD SOUGHT TO ATTACK THE PIRATES AT BARRATARIA IN HOPES OF TAKING THEIR PRIZES AND EVEN THEIR ARMED VESSELS
HE DISCOVERED A LONG DARK LOOKING VESSEL LOW IN THE WATER BUT HAVING VERY TALL MASTS WITH SAILS WHITE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW AS THE SLOOP OF WAR HAD THE WEATHER GAGE OF THE PIRATE AND COULD OUTSAIL HER BEFORE THE WIND
IN THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE ENEMY A COLUMN PUSHED FORWARD BETWEEN THE LEVEE AND RIVER AND SO PRECIPITATE WAS THEIR CHARGE THAT THE OUTPOSTS WERE FORCED TO RETIRE CLOSELY PRESSED BY THE ENEMY BEFORE THE BATTERIES COULD MEET THE CHARGE CLEARING THE DITCH
BUT THE PIRATE HAD SIX MEN KILLED BOTH VESSELS WERE CAPTURED AND BROUGHT INTO THE BAYOU SAINT JOHN AN EXPEDITION WAS NOW SENT TO DISLODGE MITCHELL AND HIS COMRADES FROM THE ISLAND HE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF
TO THE BENEFIT OF A FULL PARDON AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION AS WELL AS IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CASE I JAMES MADISON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DO ISSUE THIS PROCLAMATION
YOU MAY COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY SENDING A BOAT TO THE EASTERN POINT OF THE PASS WHERE I WILL BE FOUND YOU HAVE INSPIRED ME WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN THE ADMIRAL YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER COULD HAVE DONE HIMSELF WITH YOU ALONE I WISH TO DEAL
ON THE OUTWARD PASSAGE THEY ENCOUNTERED A HEAVY GALE OFF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHICH SPRUNG THE MAINMAST AND OTHERWISE INJURED THE SHIP
THAT THE PAPERS CONTAINED IN THE PACKET MIGHT BE OF IMPORTANCE TOWARDS THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THE OFFICERS IF WELL WATCHED COULD OBTAIN NO INTELLIGENCE THAT MIGHT TURN TO THE DETRIMENT OF LOUISIANA HE NOW EXAMINED THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET
AT HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK SHE HAULED DOWN HER COLORS AND WAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF
THE BRITISH ALREADY HAD BEEN TWICE DRIVEN BACK IN THE UTMOST CONFUSION WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND TWO GENERAL OFFICERS TWO OTHER BATTERIES WERE MANNED BY THE BARRATARIANS WHO SERVED THEIR PIECES WITH THE STEADINESS AND PRECISION OF VETERAN GUNNERS
THE PIRATES GAVE WAY MANY WERE TAKEN PRISONERS BUT MITCHELL AND THE GREATEST PART ESCAPED TO THE CYPRESS SWAMPS WHERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARREST THEM A LARGE QUANTITY OF DRY GOODS AND SPECIE TOGETHER WITH OTHER BOOTY WAS TAKEN
AFTER A VERY SUCCESSFUL CRUISE
AND AS SOON AS THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO BE IN HIS POWER HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN RECOMMENDING TO THEM AT THE SAME TIME TO CONCEAL THE BUSINESS ON WHICH THEY HAD COME UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED PERSONS LINED THE SHORE AND IT WAS A GENERAL CRY AMONGST THE CREWS OF THE PRIVATEERS AT GRAND TERRE
READY TO EXERT THEIR UTMOST EFFORTS IN DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY THIS POINT OF LOUISIANA WHICH I OCCUPY IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE PRESENT CRISIS I TENDER MY SERVICES TO DEFEND IT
HIS OBJECT IN WRITING THAT LETTER WAS BY APPEARING DISPOSED TO ACCEDE TO THEIR PROPOSALS TO GIVE TIME TO COMMUNICATE THE AFFAIR TO THE OFFICERS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT
CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED AS OBJECTS OF PUNISHMENT BUT AS OBJECTS OF A GENEROUS FORGIVENESS IT HAS THEREFORE BEEN SEEN WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA EARNESTLY RECOMMEND THOSE OFFENDERS
SHE SET HER STUDDING SAILS AND CROWDED EVERY INCH OF CANVASS IN CHASE
DOWN CAME THE DAGGER INTO THE CAPTAIN'S LEFT THIGH
WHEN TWO PRIVATEERS BEING AT ANCHOR OFF CAT ISLAND A BRITISH SLOOP OF WAR ANCHORED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PASS AND SENT HER BOATS TO ENDEAVOR TO TAKE THE PRIVATEERS BUT THEY WERE REPULSED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS
PERCEIVED SEVERAL SMOKES ALONG THE COASTS AS SIGNALS AND AT THE SAME TIME A WHITE FLAG HOISTED ON BOARD A SCHOONER AT THE FORT AN AMERICAN FLAG AT THE MAINMAST HEAD AND A CARTHAGENIAN FLAG UNDER WHICH THE PIRATES CRUISE AT HER TOPPING LIFT
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENT AN EXPEDITION UNDER COMMODORE PATTERSON TO DISPERSE THE SETTLEMENT OF MARAUDERS AT BARRATARIA THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT OF HIS LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR SIR
THESE GENERAL ORDERS WERE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF LAFITTE
THAN CALLING A FEW OF HIS BEST MEN BY HIS SIDE HE SPRUNG FORWARD TO THE POINT OF DANGER AND CLEARING THE BREASTWORK OF THE ENTRENCHMENTS LEAPED CUTLASS IN HAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY FOLLOWED BY A SCORE OF HIS MEN WHO IN MANY A HARD FOUGHT BATTLE UPON HIS OWN DECK
WHAT WAS EXPEDIENT TO BE DONE THE MESSAGE ALSO CONTAINED AN ASSURANCE THAT IN THE MEANTIME NO STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST HIM FOR HIS PAST OFFENCES AGAINST THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE TIME AGREED ON WITH CAPTAIN LOCKYER
HEREBY GRANTING PUBLISHING AND DECLARING A FREE AND FULL PARDON OF ALL OFFENCES COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF ANY ACT OR ACTS OF THE CONGRESS OF THE SAID UNITED STATES TOUCHING THE REVENUE TRADE AND NAVIGATION THEREOF
A GRAPE SHOT BROKE THE BONE OF HIS RIGHT LEG AND HE RECEIVED A CUT IN THE ABDOMEN BUT HIS CREW FOUGHT LIKE TIGERS AND THE DECK WAS ANKLE DEEP WITH BLOOD AND GORE THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOARDERS RECEIVED SUCH A TREMENDOUS BLOW ON THE HEAD FROM THE BUTT END OF A MUSKET
ALL THE PIRATES THAT SURRENDERED WERE TAKEN TO JAMAICA AND TRIED BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY COURT
AND I DO HEREBY FURTHER AUTHORIZE AND DIRECT ALL SUITS INDICTMENTS AND PROSECUTIONS FOR FINES PENALTIES AND FORFEITURES AGAINST ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO SHALL BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THIS FULL PARDON FORTHWITH TO BE STAYED DISCONTINUED AND RELEASED
UPON THIS IMPORTANT AFFAIR AND SEND YOU AN ANSWER TO MORROW AT LAFITTE WITHDREW THE GENERAL SAID FAREWELL WHEN WE MEET AGAIN I TRUST IT WILL BE IN THE RANKS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY
AND WAS MADE A PORT OF ENTRY THE NINTH OCTOBER LAST AND WHEREAS THE SUPREME CONGRESS OF SAID REPUBLIC HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO APPOINT ME AS GOVERNOR OF THIS PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH IF YOU HAVE ANY DEMANDS ON SAID GOVERNMENT OR PERSONS BELONGING TO OR RESIDING IN THE SAME
AND BY A COURT OF INQUIRY APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE FOUND GUILTY OF ROBBING THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF A NUMBER OF SLAVES AND SPECIE THE GENTLEMEN BEARING THIS MESSAGE WILL GIVE YOU ANY REASONABLE INFORMATION RELATING TO THIS PLACE THAT MAY BE REQUIRED
CLEARED HIS THROAT AS IF TO BEGIN BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD ONCE PETER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO ASK WHY BUT REMEMBERED IN TIME AND CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND AT LAST
HONEY YOU DEAD AT LAST OUTA SHEER LAZINESS WATER SALLY CARROL COOL WATER WAITIN FOR YOU
FINE GRAMMA GRASS COVERS THE ENTIRE VALLEY AND AN UNDERGROUND RIVER FURNISHES AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF GOOD WATER IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OVERLAND TRAVEL BEFORE THE COUNTRY WAS PROTECTED
TAKING AN EARLY MORNING SUN BATH LAY LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE OF COURSE PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK WERE NOT AFRAID OF HIM IF IT HAD BEEN MISTER RATTLESNAKE
HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE LET HIM FINISH THEN CALLED ALL THE OTHERS ABOUT HER AND TOLD THEM WHO HAD MADE ALL THE TROUBLE
CLARK AND SALLY CARROL ROLLED AND RATTLED DOWN VALLEY AVENUE INTO JEFFERSON STREET WHERE THE DUST ROAD BECAME A PAVEMENT ALONG OPIATE MILLICENT PLACE WHERE THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN PROSPEROUS SUBSTANTIAL MANSIONS
SUCH A WILD LIFE WAS NATURALLY FULL OF ADVENTURES AND INVOLVED MUCH HARDSHIP AND DANGER
BUT LET IT LAY AND LEFT THE ROOM HOW YOU CLARK SHE INQUIRED A MINUTE LATER AS SHE SLIPPED NIMBLY OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAR
SAVE TO RUN OUT HIS TONGUE AT THEM FINALLY THEY GAVE UP ASKING HIM I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S GO OVER TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW AND PERHAPS IF HE IS FEELING GOOD
SHE BROKE OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC SUDDENNESS AND SIGHED OH SWEET COOKY AS HER MOOD CHANGED HALF CLOSING HER EYES AND TIPPING BACK HER HEAD TILL IT RESTED ON THE SEAT BACK SHE LET THE SAVORY BREEZE
JUST AS ALL THE SNAKE FAMILY DO AT YOU AND ME TO DAY WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED TELLING THEM HOW CHEATING AND STEALING AND LYING ISN'T SMART AT ALL BUT VERY VERY DREADFUL
IN FRONT OF A PLACID STREET CAR EVEN THE SHOPS SEEMED ONLY YAWNING THEIR DOORS AND BLINKING THEIR WINDOWS IN THE SUNSHINE BEFORE RETIRING INTO A STATE OF UTTER AND FINITE COMA SALLY CARROL SAID CLARK SUDDENLY
IF NEED BE IN A FENCED ENCLOSURE THAT NOT ONLY GIVES THE CATTLE HUMANE TREATMENT BUT ALSO MAKES MONEY FOR THE OWNER THE MEN ARE INSTRUCTED TO BRING IN EVERY SICK OR WEAK ANIMAL FOUND ON THE RANGE AND PUT IT INTO A CORRAL OR PASTURE
RACE ABOUT LIKE MAD TRYING TO EXPRESS THE EXUBERANCE OF THEIR JOY IN THE BUNCH IS LITTLE BOB THE FOX TERRIER WHO TRIES HARD BUT IS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE HOUNDS IN A RACE
BUT LATER ON ANOTHER CHANGE WAS MADE TO HEREFORDS AND DURING RECENT YEARS ONLY WHITEFACES HAVE BEEN BRED UPON THE RANCH COLONEL HOOKER HAS A STRONG PERSONALITY
WATER IS BROUGHT FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN DITCHES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED AT GREAT LABOR AND EXPENSE AND IS STORED IN RESERVOIRS TO BE USED AS NEEDED FOR WATERING THE CATTLE AND IRRIGATING THE FIELDS THE EFFECT OF WATER UPON THE DESERT SOIL IS
IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WHY DOESN'T MISTER GREENSNAKE WINK AT US WHEN WE WINK AT HIM HE ASKED CHUG A RUM BECAUSE HE CAN'T REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
FROM BEING DRAGGED TO DEATH BY A STRONG SUCKING CALF AND SAVES THE PAMPERED CALF FROM DYING OF BLACKLEG BY A TIMELY CHANGE OF DIET INSTEAD OF CLASSING THE CATTLE OUT ON THE OPEN RANGE AS IS THE USUAL CUSTOM
WHOSE OWNER SAT BRILLIANTLY IF PERFUNCTORILY AT ATTENTION AS HE WAITED FOR AN ANSWER TO HIS SIGNAL AFTER A MOMENT THE WHISTLE ONCE MORE SPLIT THE DUSTY AIR GOOD MAWNIN
HE IS ACTIVE AND GETS OVER THE GROUND LIVELY FOR A SMALL DOG BUT IN A LONG CHASE IS COMPLETELY DISTANCED AND OUTCLASSED TO HIS APPARENT DISGUST ASIDE FROM THE FINE SPORT THAT THE DOGS AFFORD
AND IT IS A QUESTION OF ONLY A SHORT TIME WHEN THE REST WILL MEET THE SAME FATE WHEN THIS IS DONE THERE MAY BE NO FEWER CATTLE THAN THERE ARE NOW BUT THEY WILL BE BUNCHED IN SMALLER HERDS AND BETTER CARED FOR
YOU KNOW I DO I ADORE ALL YOU BOYS THEN WHY YOU GETTIN ENGAGED TO A YANKEE CLARK I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'LL DO BUT WELL I WANT TO GO PLACES AND SEE PEOPLE
OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY WHY NOT CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY ALL IN THE SAME BREATH CHUG A RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDING HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
WHAT YOU DOIN EATIN N APPLE COME ON GO SWIMMIN' WANT TO RECKON SO HOW BOUT HURRYIN UP SURE ENOUGH SALLY CARROL SIGHED VOLUMINOUSLY
HE LABORIOUSLY CROSSED TWO DUST RUTS THE WHEELS SQUEAKING INDIGNANTLY AT THE ENCOUNTER AND THEN WITH A TERRIFYING EXPRESSION
EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE GIVEN THE FREEDOM OF THE RANGE TO FIND WATER IF THEY CAN AND GRASS THAT OFTEN AFFORDS THEM ONLY SCANT PICKING UNDER THE NEW REGIME THE CATTLE ARE CAREFULLY FED AND WATERED
AND HE HAD SPENT THE TWO YEARS SINCE HE GRADUATED FROM GEORGIA TECH IN DOZING ROUND THE LAZY STREETS OF HIS HOME TOWN DISCUSSING HOW HE COULD BEST INVEST HIS CAPITAL FOR AN IMMEDIATE FORTUNE
AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
HE HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT THE DRAUGHTS CONTAINING DISSOLVED PEARLS WHICH THE QUACK DOCTOR LEONI DI SPOLETO PRESCRIBED FOR HIM AS IF HE DESIRED TO ADAPT HIS REMEDIES RATHER TO THE RICHES OF HIS PATIENT THAN TO HIS NECESSITIES
ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
MISTER BENNETT WHO WAS AMONG THE GUESTS HAVING FORGIVEN MY CARELESSNESS INVITED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LIEDERKRANZ MASKED BALL WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW EVENINGS AND WOULD BE A GRAND SPECTACLE TOGETHER WE ATTENDED THE BALL AND DURING THE EVENING I WAS WELL ENTERTAINED
FRANCESCO FRESCOBALDI AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OTHERS WHOSE NAMES WERE NONE THE LESS DEAR TO FLORENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS RENOWNED SO MUCH FOR YOUR CRIMES AND AT EACH OF THESE NAMES WHICH SAVONAROLA PRONOUNCED SLOWLY HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DYING MAN
THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
THAT IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FACE THE THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES
I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
NED BUNTLINE AND FRED MAEDER HAD DRAMATIZED ONE OF THE STORIES WHICH THE FORMER HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR THE NEW YORK WEEKLY THE DRAMA WAS CALLED BUFFALO BILL THE KING OF BORDER MEN WHILE I WAS IN NEW YORK IT WAS PRODUCED AT THE BOWERY THEATER
BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
COMING LIKE THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDANTE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF A DON GIOVANNI AND IN THE MIDST OF FEAST AND ORGY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS EVEN NOW THE MOMENT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF HEAVEN HE HAD BEEN BORN AT FERRARA
AND I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO RIDE OVER TO THE POST WITH HIM IN AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY THITHER HE ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY HE SAID THAT GENERAL SHERIDAN AND HIMSELF HAD HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MATTER
HIS LIPS CLINGING TO THE FEET OF THE CHRIST HE BREATHED HIS LAST IN THE ARMS OF THESE THREE MEN OF WHOM THE MOST FORTUNATE THOUGH ALL THREE WERE YOUNG WAS NOT DESTINED TO SURVIVE HIM MORE THAN TWO YEARS
THE DANCERS KEPT ON THEIR MASKS UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THE MERRY AND MOTLEY THRONG PRESENTED A BRILLIANT SCENE MOVING GRACEFULLY BENEATH THE BRIGHT GAS LIGHT TO THE INSPIRITING MUSIC TO ME IT WAS A NOVEL AND ENTERTAINING SIGHT
AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
AND I HAD THE HONOR OF RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT NEW YORK I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY MISTER J G HECKSHER WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMITTEE OF ONE TO ESCORT ME TO THE UNION CLUB
THAT THE PLEASURE SEEKER AND USURPER AWAITED THAT SEVERE AND GLOOMY PREACHER BY WHOSE WORDS ALL FLORENCE WAS STIRRED AND ON WHOSE PARDON HENCEFORTH DEPENDED ALL HIS HOPE FOR ANOTHER WORLD INDEED SAVONAROLA WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN OF STONE
A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
I NEVER FELT MORE RELIEVED IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE VIEW OF THAT IMMENSE CROWD THAT EVENING MISTER FRELEIGH OFFERED TO GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO PLAY THE PART OF BUFFALO BILL MYSELF
AND FOUND THEIR FRIEND CONVULSIVELY CLUTCHING IN HIS ARMS A MAGNIFICENT CRUCIFIX WHICH HE HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE BED HEAD IN VAIN DID THEY TRY TO REASSURE HIM WITH FRIENDLY WORDS LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT ONLY REPLIED WITH SOBS
MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
WELL SAID PETER WITH A SIGH HAND ME THE CASH AND I WILL GO I'LL FORM A JOINT STOCK COMPANY AND TURN AN HONEST POUND OR SO I'M GRIEVED SAID PAUL TO SEEM UNKIND THE MONEY SHALT OF COURSE BE LENT BUT FOR A WEEK OR TWO I FIND IT WILL NOT BE CONVENIENT
EACH OF THEM THREADED HER NEEDLE WITH A SHORT END OF THREAD ATTACHED TO THE WORK WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PULLED BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE THROUGH THE STUFF DRAGGING THE NEEDLE AFTER IT THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF THE LITTLE SEMPSTRESS CAUGHT IT AT THE OTHER SIDE BUT ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN THE NEXT MOMENT
THE EARL SEEMED TO SHARE MY SURPRISE WHO SPOKE HE EXCLAIMED IT WAS I SAID ARTHUR LOOKING AT US WITH A WORN HAGGARD FACE AND EYES FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF LIFE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE FADED
BUT THE REAL USEFULNESS OF THIS MAGIC POWER I THOUGHT WOULD BE TO UNDO SOME HARM SOME PAINFUL EVENT SOME ACCIDENT I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING THIS PROPERTY ALSO OF THE MAGIC WATCH FOR EVEN AS THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
HIS FLOWING LOCKS HE WILDLY TORE AND VERY SOON HIS YELLOW HAIR WAS LYING ALL ABOUT THE FLOOR THE LEGAL FRIEND WAS STANDING BY WITH SUDDEN PITY HALF UNMANNED THE TEAR DROP TREMBLED IN HIS EYE THE SIGNED AGREEMENT IN HIS HAND
IN ANOTHER HOUSE THE ENTRANCE OF A STRANGER MIGHT CAUSE SURPRISE PERHAPS ANGER EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO EXPEL THE SAID STRANGER WITH VIOLENCE BUT HERE I KNEW NOTHING OF THE SORT COULD HAPPEN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS FIRST TO THINK NOTHING ABOUT ME
I COULD NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MY CHILD MARRIED TO A MAN WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO LIVE FOR WITHOUT EVEN AN OBJECT TO DIE FOR I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY A STRANGE VOICE SAID THE SPEAKER WAS EVIDENTLY IN THE ROOM BUT I HAD NOT HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND I LOOKED ROUND IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
HOW GOOD HOW GREAT POOR PETER CRIED YET I MUST SELL MY SUNDAY WIG THE SCARF PIN THAT HAS BEEN MY PRIDE MY GRAND PIANO AND MY PIG FULL SOON HIS PROPERTY TOOK WINGS AND DAILY AS EACH TREASURE WENT
HOW FEW IN THIS COLD AGE OF GREED DO GOOD EXCEPT ON SELFISH GROUNDS BUT I CAN FEEL FOR PETER'S NEED AND I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS HOW GREAT WAS PETER'S JOY TO FIND HIS FRIEND IN SUCH A GENIAL VEIN
A MAN MAY SURELY CLAIM HIS DUES BUT WHEN THERE'S MONEY TO BE LENT A MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE SUCH TIMES AS ARE CONVENIENT IT CHANCED ONE DAY AS PETER SAT GNAWING A CRUST HIS USUAL MEAL
DELIGHTFUL POWER OF MAGIC I THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF HUMAN SUFFERING I HAVE NOT ONLY RELIEVED BUT ACTUALLY ANNIHILATED AND IN A GLOW OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE
AND LET ME WISH YOU JOY ALSO DEAR FRIEND HE ADDED LOOKING SADLY AT THE EARL AND SPEAKING IN THE SAME HOLLOW TONES THAT HAD STARTLED US SO MUCH THANK YOU THE OLD MAN SAID SIMPLY AND HEARTILY
DO YOU MEAN THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A SENSE FOR TWO YEARS THE OLD MAN GENTLY REPLIED THAT IS HE HAS HAD MY PROMISE TO CONSENT TO IT SO SOON AS HE COULD SECURE A PERMANENT AND SETTLED LINE IN LIFE
TO BE A BRIDE THE FATHER IN ORDER TO DO HIS PART IN A CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED ONLY FIT FOR LUNATICS REPLIED WHISPER IT TO ME DEAR BUT SHE DIDN'T WHISPER THESE CHILDREN NEVER DID ANYTHING THEY WERE TOLD
AS I WAS SAYING THE OTHER PROFESSOR RESUMED IF YOU'LL JUST THINK OVER ANY POEM THAT CONTAINS THE WORDS SUCH AS PETER IS POOR SAID NOBLE PAUL AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIS FRIEND AND THOUGH MY MEANS TO GIVE ARE SMALL AT LEAST I CAN AFFORD TO LEND
MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO ME THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THOSE WORDS TILL NOW THE NEXT FEW DAYS PASSED WEARILY ENOUGH I FELT NO INCLINATION TO CALL BY MYSELF AT THE HALL STILL LESS TO PROPOSE THAT ARTHUR SHOULD GO WITH ME
HE SIGHED TO FIND THE STATE OF THINGS GROW LESS AND LESS CONVENIENT WEEKS GREW TO MONTHS AND MONTHS TO YEARS PETER WAS WORN TO SKIN AND BONE
AN EMPTY FORK IS RAISED TO THE LIPS THERE IT RECEIVES A NEATLY CUT PIECE OF MUTTON AND SWIFTLY CONVEYS IT TO THE PLATE WHERE IT INSTANTLY ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE MUTTON ALREADY THERE SOON ONE OF THE PLATES FURNISHED WITH A COMPLETE SLICE OF MUTTON AND TWO POTATOES
IT SEEMED BETTER TO WAIT TILL TIME THAT GENTLE HEALER OF OUR BITTEREST SORROWS SHOULD HAVE HELPED HIM TO RECOVER FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD BLIGHTED HIS LIFE BUSINESS HOWEVER SOON DEMANDED MY PRESENCE IN TOWN
AND YOU HAVE TIME TO CULTIVATE THAT BEST OF QUALITIES CONTENT FOR WHICH YOU'LL FIND YOUR PRESENT STATE REMARKABLY CONVENIENT SAID PETER THOUGH I CANNOT SOUND THE DEPTHS OF SUCH A MAN AS YOU YET IN YOUR CHARACTER I'VE FOUND AN INCONSISTENCY OR TWO
THE EARL WAS SITTING ALONE WHEN WE ENTERED I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME IN TO KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID MURIEL IS GONE TO BED THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER
AND NOW THAT HE HAS ARRANGED MATTERS WITH MURIEL HE HAS BUSINESS IN TOWN THAT MUST BE SEEN TO AT ONCE WHAT ARRANGEMENT DO YOU MEAN I ASKED WITH A SINKING HEART AS THE THOUGHT OF ARTHUR'S CRUSHED HOPES CAME TO MY MIND
HOWEVER THE PARTY WITH THE ADDITION OF A GENTLEMAN AS GOOD NATURED AND AS ROSY AS THE CHILDREN SEATED THEMSELVES AT IT VERY CONTENTEDLY YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE EATING CHERRY TART AND EVERY NOW AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY CONVEYING A CHERRY STONE FROM THEIR LIPS TO THEIR PLATES
AND AT LAST THEY PARTED I WAITED TILL THEY WERE SOME TWENTY YARDS APART AND THEN PUT THE WATCH A MINUTE BACK THE INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE WAS STARTLING THE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO FLASH BACK INTO THEIR FORMER PLACES ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK
AND START AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SHORT END AT LAST ALL THE WORK WAS PICKED TO PIECES AND PUT AWAY AND THE LADY LED THE WAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM WALKING BACKWARDS AND MAKING THE INSANE REMARK NOT YET DEAR WE MUST GET THE SEWING DONE FIRST
THIS STYLE OF BUSINESS SEEMS TO ME EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT NO NOBLENESS OF SOUL HAVE I LIKE SOME THAT IN THIS AGE ARE FOUND
AND AT THE BARBER'S AS I THINK YOU OFTEN GET YOUR WHISKERS CURLED THOUGH NOBLENESS YOU CA'N'T ATTAIN TO ANY VERY GREAT EXTENT THE PATH OF HONESTY IS PLAIN HOWEVER INCONVENIENT TIS TRUE SAID PETER I'M ALIVE I KEEP MY STATION IN THE WORLD
OF HIS OWN LIFE WHEN THE SURGEON HEARD IT HE ALMOST ENVIED GILES HIS CHIVALROUS CHARACTER HE EXPRESSED A WISH TO MARTY THAT HIS VISIT TO HER SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET AND WENT HOME THOUGHTFUL
AN ANXIOUS LOOK HAD COME INTO RUFE'S EYES WOULD SHE LIE FOR HIM NEVER SAID JUNE AH SHE WOULD SHE WAS A TOLLIVER AND RUFE TOOK A BREATH OF DEEP CONTENT
IT QUITE TERRIFIED HIM WHEN HE FIRST SAW WHAT YOU HAD DONE TO IT THIS MORNING SHE ADDED
WE SHORE OURSELVES OF ALL BUT THE BARE NECESSARIES OF LIFE BUT EVEN THEY FOR A FAMILY OF TEN ARE CONSIDERABLE AND IT WAS A MIGHTY TUSSLE TO GET BOTH ENDS WITHIN COVER OF MEETING WE FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THE HEAVY HAND OF POVERTY
AT HIS LAST EXIT FROM THE SAME APARTMENT HE NODDED TO WINTERBORNE
OR EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE IS AWAKE SO THAT HE DOESN'T SEE IT FALL FOR THAT WOULD TERRIFY HIM WORSE THAN EVER KEEP THE BLIND DOWN TILL I COME AND THEN I'LL ASSURE HIM AND SHOW HIM THAT HIS TROUBLE IS OVER THE DOCTOR THEN DEPARTED AND THEY WAITED TILL THE EVENING
FROM THIS FOILED ATTACK UPON HER LIFE GRACE WENT TO MARTY SOUTH'S COTTAGE THE CURRENT OF HER BEING HAD AGAIN SET TOWARDS THE LOST GILES WINTERBORNE MARTY SHE SAID WE BOTH LOVED HIM WE WILL GO TO HIS GRAVE TOGETHER
THE EFFECT THOUGH NOT MIRACULOUS WAS REMARKABLE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR SHE FELT CALMER COOLER BETTER ABLE TO REFLECT LESS INCLINED TO FRET AND CHAFE AND WEAR HERSELF AWAY SHE TOOK A FEW DROPS MORE
MY LIFE MY CAREER MY BRILLIANT CAREER I WAS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN A FEW FLEETING HOURS AND I WOULD BE OLD AS THOSE AROUND ME I LOOKED AT THEM AS THEY STOOD THERE WEARY AND TURNING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL OF LIFE
RECALLED THE CASE TO HIS THOUGHTS AND WENT LEISURELY ON TO WHERE SOUTH SAT FITZPIERS WAS ON THE WHOLE A FINELY FORMED HANDSOME MAN HIS EYES WERE DARK AND IMPRESSIVE AND BEAMED WITH THE LIGHT EITHER OF ENERGY
BUT ALREADY AT A SIGNAL FROM HALE SEVERAL GUARDS WERE PUSHING THROUGH THE CROWD AND OLD JUDD SAW THEM COMING AND SAW THE FALINS ABOUT HIM AND THE WINCHESTERS AT THE PORT HOLES AND HE STOPPED WITH A HARD GULP AND STOOD LOOKING AT JUNE
IF SHE WISHED TO PRESERVE HERSELF FROM FALLING A VICTIM TO THE MALADY WHICH HAD PULLED DOWN WINTERBORNE SHE EXAMINED IT AS WELL AS SHE COULD
AND AS TAUGHT IN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES I AM DEPICTING PRACTICAL DAIRYING AS I HAVE LIVED IT AND SEEN IT LIVED BY DOZENS OF FAMILIES AROUND ME
LIKE THE SWORD OF THE LORD AND OF GIDEON WELL CAN I DO ANYTHING ELSE ASKED HE THE DOCTOR SAYS THE TREE OUGHT TO BE CUT DOWN OH
COULD BE FOUND WHO WOULD CONVICT A TOLLIVER FOR THERE WERE NO TWELVE MEN IN THE MOUNTAINS WHO WOULD DARE
WE MARCHED HER HOME AND GAVE HER A BRAN MASH THEN WE TURNED TO OUR WORK IN THE HOUSE WHILE THE MEN SAT AND SMOKED AND SPAT ON THE VERANDA DISCUSSING THE DROUGHT FOR AN HOUR AT THE END OF WHICH TIME THEY WENT TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE WITH THEIR STOCK I MADE UP THE FIRE AND WE CONTINUED OUR IRONING
THE PROOF THAT WAS TO SEND RUFE TOLLIVER TO THE SCAFFOLD
I APOLOGIZE
A FEW LIGHT WIND SMITTEN CLOUDS MADE WAN STREAKS ACROSS THE WHITE SKY HAGGARD WITH THE FIERCE RELENTLESS GLARE OF THE AFTERNOON SUN WEARINESS WAS WRITTEN ACROSS MY MOTHER'S DELICATE CAREWORN FEATURES AND FOUND EXPRESSION IN MY FATHER'S KNITTED BROWS AND DUSTY FACE
AND HERE HE HOVERED FOR HOURS AROUND THE SCENE OF THE PUREST EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT HE HAD EVER KNOWN IN HIS LIFE HE WALKED ABOUT THE WOODS THAT SURROUNDED MELBURY'S HOUSE
EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS HOUSE SOMETIMES SHE SUCCEEDED IN HER ATTEMPT SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT THEY STOOD BY THE GRAVE TOGETHER AND THOUGH THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN
MAN WHO TOOK MUCH PLEASURE IN DEALING WITH HOUSE PROPERTY IN HIS SMALL WAY SINCE ONE OF THE SOUTHS STILL SURVIVED THERE WAS NOT MUCH DOUBT THAT GILES COULD DO WHAT HIS FATHER HAD LEFT UNDONE AS FAR AS HIS OWN LIFE WAS CONCERNED THIS POSSIBILITY CHEERED HIM MUCH
LET THEM LONG AS PASSIONATELY AS I HAVE LONGED FOR READING AND MUSIC AND BE UNABLE TO PROCURE IT BECAUSE OF POVERTY LET POVERTY FORCE THEM INTO DOING WORK AGAINST WHICH EVERY FIBRE OF THEIR BEING REVOLTS AS IT HAS FORCED ME AND THEN SEE IF THEIR LIVES WILL BE HAPPY
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN YEARS BEFORE
WHICH MARTY'S HAD NOT REMAINED
THIS COW LIFTING BECAME QUITE A TRADE THE WHOLE DAY BEING SPENT IN IT AND IN DISCUSSING THE BAD PROSPECT AHEAD IF THE DROUGHT CONTINUED MANY AN EXTRA LINE OF CARE FURROWED THE BROWS OF THE DISHEARTENED BUSHMEN THEN
IF SO AS SHE IS GONE AWAY I MUST SPEAK TO HER AGENT OH NEVER MIND WHOSE TREE IT IS
AND TO WHOM SHE HAD NEVER STAINED HER WHITE SOUL WITH A WORD OF UNTRUTH
FRIGHTENED LOOK THAT HALE REMEMBERED THE SAME LOOK SHE HAD SHOWN LONG AGO WHEN RUFE'S NAME WAS MENTIONED IN THE OLD MILLER'S CABIN AND WHEN GOING UP THE RIVER ROAD SHE HAD PUT HER CHILDISH TRUST IN HIM TO SEE THAT HER BAD UNCLE BOTHERED HER NO MORE
WHEN DRAGGING ALONG THROUGH LIFE THE HAPPIER IT IS FOR HIM AND DOUBLY TREBLY SO FOR HER POOR LITTLE CALVES SLAVES TO THE GREED OF MAN
HOPE SWEET CRUEL DELUSIVE HOPE WHISPERED IN MY EAR THAT LIFE WAS LONG WITH MUCH BY AND BY AND IN THAT BY AND BY MY DREAM LIFE WOULD BE REAL SO ON I WENT WITH THAT GLEAMING LAKE IN THE DISTANCE BECKONING ME TO COME AND SAIL ON ITS SILVER WATERS
THE LIKELIHOOD WAS THAT DEATH ALONE HAD HINDERED HIM IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS PROJECT
SHE COULD INDULGE IN MOURNFUL FANCIES LIKE THIS TO MARTY
NOR I TO HIM YET YOU AND HE COULD SPEAK IN A TONGUE THAT NOBODY ELSE KNEW NOT EVEN MY FATHER THOUGH HE CAME NEAREST KNOWING
IT WAS THE USUAL HIDING PLACE AMONG RURAL LIFEHOLDERS FOR SUCH DOCUMENTS WINTERBORNE SAT DOWN ON THE BED AND LOOKED THEM OVER THEY WERE ORDINARY LEASES FOR THREE LIVES WHICH A MEMBER OF THE SOUTH FAMILY SOME FIFTY YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME
DOWN WITH IT THEN AND HANG MISSUS CHARMOND SAID MISTER FITZPIERS
THAT IS ALL WE HEARD OF THE MATTER EXCEPT THE NUMEROUS GARBLED ACCOUNTS WHICH WERE CARRIED HOME THAT AFTERNOON A DROUGHT IDYLL SYBYLLA WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER I'M IRONING
I DON'T FORGET THAT YOUR HEART IS SET ON ARMADALE AND THAT THE MAJOR HOWEVER HE MAY TALK HAS ALWAYS ENDED HITHERTO IN GIVING YOU YOUR OWN WAY MY HEAD MAY BE GETTING DULLER AND DULLER
UNLESS ALLAN COMMITS PERJURY THE LOVERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE OF BLACKSTONE IN SPEECHLESS DISMAY SHUT UP THE BOOK SAID NEELIE RESIGNEDLY
DON'T LOOK AT ME LOOK AT BLACKSTONE AND BEGIN
THE NEXT DISABILITY PROCEEDED ALLAN IS WANT OF AGE THE AGE FOR CONSENT TO MATRIMONY IS FOURTEEN IN MALES AND TWELVE IN FEMALES COME CRIED ALLAN CHEERFULLY BLACKSTONE BEGINS EARLY ENOUGH AT ANY RATE
WAS NO EFFORT TO HIM AND MIND
WHY WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN I WAS COMING BACK SAYS THE SAILOR SHE LOOKED HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE AND ANSWERED I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU THERE DO YOU THINK SUCH A WOMAN AS THAT
THERE IS THE CASE AS HE CALLED IT ONLY QUOTED TO TAUNT ME UTTERLY UNLIKE MY OWN CASE AT THE TIME THERE IT HAS BEEN WAITING AND LURKING FOR ME THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES IN MY LIFE
SHALL YOU BE VERY LONG AWAY I'LL BE OFF TO DAY SAID ALLAN BY THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK TRAIN AND I'LL BE BACK TO MORROW IF I AND MY FRIEND THE CLERK CAN SETTLE IT ALL IN TIME
UNDER HIS REAL NAME STEP THE FIRST LET ARMADALE LEAVE THORPE AMBROSE A SINGLE MAN AND DIE IN SOME DISTANT PLACE AMONG STRANGERS STEP THE SECOND
TALL BEAUTIFUL AND RESOLUTE
LAW OF HUSBAND AND WIFE HERE'S A BIT I DON'T UNDERSTAND TO BEGIN WITH IT MAY BE OBSERVED GENERALLY THAT THE LAW CONSIDERS MARRIAGE IN THE LIGHT OF A CONTRACT
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUNG PEDGIFT HE'S A THOROUGH GOOD FELLOW I'M SURE WE COULD TRUST YOUNG PEDGIFT TO KEEP OUR SECRET NOT FOR WORLDS EXCLAIMED NEELIE YOU MAY BE WILLING TO TRUST YOUR SECRETS TO THE VULGAR LITTLE WRETCH
WHETHER THERE WAS ANY FEAR OF THE POLICE BEING CONCERNED IN HER MARRIAGE AS WELL AS THE PARSON AND THE CLERK ALLAN BEING A MAN OUGHT TO KNOW AND TO ALLAN SHE LOOKED FOR INFORMATION
EVENTS PAVING THE WAY SMOOTHLY AND MORE SMOOTHLY STRAIGHT TO THE END IN THREE BOLD STEPS ONLY THREE THAT END MIGHT BE REACHED LET MIDWINTER MARRY ME PRIVATELY
AND SIGNED TO HIM IMPATIENTLY TO GO THE CONFLICT OF CONTENDING EMOTIONS WHICH SHE HAD MASTERED THUS FAR BURST ITS WAY OUTWARD IN SPITE OF HER AFTER HE HAD WAVED HIS HAND FOR THE LAST TIME AND HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DELL
THAT'S THE MAN TO HELP US BLACKSTONE'S A MERE INFANT TO HIM DON'T SAY IT'S ABSURD DON'T SAY IT'S EXACTLY LIKE ME DO PRAY HEAR ME OUT
WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO TELL ME I WAS PRESSING HER FURTHER THAN SHE HAD COURAGE TO GO A HANDSOME WOMAN TOO LIKE YOURSELF YOU WOULD DRIVE SOME MEN IN MY POSITION TO WISH THEY HAD HER NOW IN YOUR PLACE I READ NO FURTHER
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO PROPOSE CRIED THE HEADLONG ALLAN
HALF PAST TWO ONLY HALF PAST TWO OH THE DREADFUL WEARINESS OF THESE LONG SUMMER DAYS
IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE PRESENT THERE ARE SOME HOURS STILL TO SPARE BEFORE THE POST GOES OUT SUPPOSE I ASKED ARMADALE TO LEND ME THE MONEY I SHOULD ENJOY GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF HIM
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANOTHER TO TRY SAID NEELIE TAKE MY WORD FOR IT PERSISTED ALLAN STOUTLY THERE MUST BE WAYS AND MEANS OF CIRCUMVENTING BLACKSTONE WITHOUT PERJURY IF WE ONLY KNEW OF THEM IT'S A MATTER OF LAW
IT SEEMS LIKE A MINUTE I CAN'T LOOK BACK THROUGH THESE LEAVES BUT I KNOW I WROTE SOMEWHERE THAT I FELT MYSELF GETTING NEARER AND NEARER TO SOME END THAT WAS STILL HIDDEN FROM ME THE END IS HIDDEN NO LONGER
IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN SAID NEELIE PICKING UP THE POCKET BOOK WITH HER EYES AND HER COMPLEXION AT THEIR BRIGHTEST AND BEST I SHALL SIT WITH MY BACK TO YOU FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING WILL YOU GO ON
AND SHE HAD UTTERLY CONFOUNDED ALLAN BY INQUIRING WHETHER THE CONTEMPLATED ELOPEMENT WAS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY THE LAW
SHALL BE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE YEARS OATH MUST FIRST BE MADE THAT THE CONSENT OF THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CONSENT IS REQUIRED HAS BEEN OBTAINED OR THAT THERE IS NO PERSON HAVING AUTHORITY TO GIVE SUCH CONSENT
I CAME TO THE LAST THE LETTER HE WROTE TO ENCOURAGE ME WHEN I HESITATED AS THE TERRIBLE TIME CAME NEARER AND NEARER
AND WE MUST CONSULT SOMEBODY IN THE PROFESSION I DARE SAY IT'S A RISK BUT NOTHING VENTURE NOTHING HAVE
BUT NEELIE WAS NOT SATISFIED EVEN YET SHE REVERTED TO FIRST PRINCIPLES AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHETHER ALLAN WAS QUITE SURE HE LOVED HER
AND WERE SO WELL MANAGED BY HER THAT THE LAWYERS THEMSELVES ACKNOWLEDGED SHE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED
I WON'T HAVE HIM TRUSTED WITH MINE I HATE HIM NO SHE CONCLUDED WITH A MOUNTING COLOR AND A PEREMPTORY STAMP OF HER FOOT ON THE GRASS
FOR IT HAS COME STRAIGHT OUT OF THAT OTHER TEMPTATION TO WHICH I YIELDED IN THE BY GONE TIME YES THERE THE LETTER HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ME IN MY BOX TO SERVE A PURPOSE NEVER THOUGHT OF BY THE VILLAIN WHO WROTE IT
ONE MORE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN HER WAY THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING ALLAN TO LONDON NOW PROMISED TO BE REMOVED BY AN ACT OF ALLAN'S OWN WILL TO LONDON REPEATED NEELIE LOOKING UP IN ASTONISHMENT
AND RUTHLESS IGNORANCE COULD HAVE DONE LITTLE TO MAKE IT UNPICTURESQUE IT WAS VEGETABLE NATURE'S OWN HOME A SPOT TO INSPIRE THE PAINTER AND POET OF STILL LIFE IF THEY DID NOT SUFFER TOO MUCH FROM THE RELAXING ATMOSPHERE
HE KNEW THE HISTORIES OF ALL THESE WHICH GIN HAD BROKEN A MAN'S LEG WHICH GUN HAD KILLED A MAN THAT ONE I REMEMBER HIS SAYING
BUT THE GRAY LEAD ROOFS WERE QUITE VISIBLE BEHIND IT WITH THEIR GUTTERS LAPS ROLLS AND SKYLIGHTS TOGETHER WITH INCISED LETTERINGS AND SHOE PATTERNS CUT BY IDLERS THEREON
HE INVESTIGATES THEOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS AND ALL SORTS OF SUBJECTS WHAT IS HIS NAME FITZPIERS HE REPRESENTS A VERY OLD FAMILY I BELIEVE THE FITZPIERSES OF BUCKBURY FITZPIERS
UP TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME THAT LADY HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED IN HER COMINGS STAYINGS AND GOINGS BY A RELATIVE BELIEVED TO BE HER AUNT LATTERLY HOWEVER THESE TWO LADIES HAD SEPARATED
ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED TO GO THROUGH AN IDENTICALLY SIMILAR PROCESS ONE QUARTER OF THE TREES WOULD DIE AWAY DURING THE ENSUING AUGUST HENCE WINTERBORNE FOUND DELIGHT IN THE WORK EVEN WHEN AS AT PRESENT
WHEN MISS MELBURY WAS ANNOUNCED AND SAW HER THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS BETWEEN THEM SHE CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE AND TOLD THE YOUNG GIRL IT WAS GOOD OF HER TO COME AH YOU HAVE NOTICED THOSE SHE SAID
OF THE FRAGILITY TO WHICH THESE HAVE DECLINED
NOT A GREAT MANY MILES FROM HERE I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY LOCAL TO KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE FAMILY I WAS NEVER IN THE COUNTY TILL MY HUSBAND BROUGHT ME HERE MISSUS CHARMOND DID NOT CARE TO PURSUE THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CURRENTS RATHER THAN STEER I AM THE MOST INACTIVE WOMAN WHEN I AM HERE SHE SAID I THINK SOMETIMES I WAS BORN TO LIVE AND DO NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING BUT FLOAT ABOUT
YOU'VE A COLD IN THE HEAD MARTY HE SAID AS THEY WALKED THAT COMES OF CUTTING OFF YOUR HAIR I SUPPOSE IT DO YES I'VE THREE HEADACHES GOING ON IN MY HEAD AT THE SAME TIME THREE HEADACHES
HE PUT MOST OF THESE ROOTS TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST FOR HE SAID IN FORTY YEARS TIME WHEN SOME GREAT GALE IS BLOWING FROM THAT QUARTER THE TREES WILL REQUIRE THE STRONGEST HOLDFAST ON THAT SIDE TO STAND AGAINST IT AND NOT FALL
WHO WAS LOOKING OVER THE HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY UPON THE FIGURE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS GRACE HE APPEARED AS A HANDSOME AND GENTLEMANLY PERSONAGE OF SIX OR EIGHT AND TWENTY AND WAS QUIZZING HER THROUGH AN EYE GLASS
SHE ERECTED ONE OF THE YOUNG PINES INTO ITS HOLE AND HELD UP HER FINGER THE SOFT MUSICAL BREATHING INSTANTLY SET IN WHICH WAS NOT TO CEASE NIGHT OR DAY TILL THE GROWN TREE SHOULD BE FELLED
FROM THE SPOT WHICH GRACE HAD REACHED A STONE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN THROWN OVER OR INTO THE BIRDS' NESTED CHIMNEYS OF THE MANSION ITS WALLS WERE SURMOUNTED BY A BATTLEMENTED PARAPET
HE WAS STILL MORE OF THAT OPINION WHEN STANDING IN HIS GARDEN NEXT DAY HE SAW HER GO PAST ON THE JOURNEY WITH SUCH A PRETTY PRIDE IN THE EVENT HE WONDERED IF HER FATHER'S AMBITION WHICH HAD PURCHASED FOR HER THE MEANS OF INTELLECTUAL LIGHT AND CULTURE
AND TO DRAW GROANS FROM THE GREGARIOUSLY DISPOSED GRACE DESCENDED THE GREEN ESCARPMENT BY A ZIGZAG PATH INTO THE DRIVE WHICH SWEPT ROUND BENEATH THE SLOPE THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO HER FROM HER CHILDHOOD
SEEING THAT GRACE'S EYES WERE ATTRACTED BY SOME CURIOUS OBJECTS AGAINST THE WALLS THEY ARE MAN TRAPS MY HUSBAND WAS A CONNOISSEUR IN MAN TRAPS AND SPRING GUNS AND SUCH ARTICLES COLLECTING THEM FROM ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SYMPATHETIC SO APPRECIATIVE IN THE SOUND OF GRACE'S VOICE THAT IT IMPELLED PEOPLE TO PLAY HAVOC WITH THEIR CUSTOMARY RESERVATIONS IN TALKING TO HER IT IS TENDER AND KIND OF YOU TO FEEL THAT SAID MISSUS CHARMOND
MAN TRAPS ARE OF RATHER OMINOUS SIGNIFICANCE WHERE A PERSON OF OUR SEX LIVES ARE THEY NOT GRACE WAS BOUND TO SMILE BUT THAT SIDE OF WOMANLINESS WAS ONE WHICH HER INEXPERIENCE HAD NO GREAT ZEST IN CONTEMPLATING
JUST BEFORE GRACE'S DEPARTURE THE TWO CHANCED TO PAUSE BEFORE A MIRROR WHICH REFLECTED THEIR FACES IN IMMEDIATE JUXTAPOSITION SO AS TO BRING INTO PROMINENCE THEIR RESEMBLANCES AND THEIR CONTRASTS
HE CONTRACTED TO DO IT ON PORTIONS OF THE WOODLAND IN WHICH HE HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST MARTY WHO TURNED HER HAND TO ANYTHING WAS USUALLY THE ONE WHO PERFORMED THE PART OF KEEPING THE TREES IN A PERPENDICULAR POSITION WHILE HE THREW IN THE MOULD
HOWEVER SHE PARTED FROM HER YOUNG FRIEND IN THE KINDLIEST TONES PROMISING TO SEND AND LET HER KNOW AS SOON AS HER MIND WAS MADE UP ON THE ARRANGEMENT SHE HAD SUGGESTED WHEN GRACE HAD ASCENDED NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE ADJOINING SLOPE
GRACE HAD NOT I THINK HE IS NOT A VERY OLD MAN SHE ADDED HAS HE A WIFE I AM NOT AWARE THAT HE HAS WELL I HOPE HE WILL BE USEFUL HERE I MUST GET TO KNOW HIM WHEN I COME BACK
WINTERBORNE'S FINGERS WERE ENDOWED WITH A GENTLE CONJUROR'S TOUCH IN SPREADING THE ROOTS OF EACH LITTLE TREE RESULTING IN A SORT OF CARESS UNDER WHICH THE DELICATE FIBRES ALL LAID THEMSELVES OUT IN THEIR PROPER DIRECTIONS FOR GROWTH
REGARDING GRACE WITH A FINAL GLANCE OF CRITICISM SHE SEEMED TO MAKE UP HER MIND TO CONSIDER THE YOUNG GIRL SATISFACTORY AND CONTINUED NOW I AM OFTEN IMPELLED TO RECORD MY IMPRESSIONS OF TIMES AND PLACES
AND THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO PLANT THEM WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE HAD A MARVELLOUS POWER OF MAKING TREES GROW ALTHOUGH HE WOULD SEEM TO SHOVEL IN THE EARTH QUITE CARELESSLY
WINTERBORNE'S THOUGHTS RAN UPON GRACE'S ANNOUNCED VISIT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WHY COULD HE NOT HAVE PROPOSED TO WALK WITH HER PART OF THE WAY SOMETHING TOLD HIM THAT SHE MIGHT NOT ON SUCH AN OCCASION CARE FOR HIS COMPANY
IF MY CLIENT CHOSE TO RESIST YOUR CLAIMS HE COULD RETAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF FURNITURE AS HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES UNDER THE LAW WHICH EXEMPTS CERTAIN NECESSARY THINGS
MATTHEW HAVING RECOVERED FROM THE FLUTTER INTO WHICH HE WAS THROWN WAS ABOUT TO DISCLAIM THE OFFICE THUS THRUST UPON HIM
AND SUGGESTIONS HERE AND THERE TO GO TO A DRUG STORE AND GET A DRINK HUGH AND CARL STROLLED HOME OVER THE DARK CAMPUS BOTH OF THEM RADIANT WITH EXCITEMENT
QUIGG VEILING HIS DISSATISFACTION UNDER A LOOK OF COMPLETE MISANTHROPY BUT THE SMALL ONES HEADED BY RICKARTS THE SHOEMAKER HIGHLY COMMENDED IT BESIDES ADDED A BUTTER MAN
AND I REFER YOU TO HIM FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OF ALL YOUR CLAIMS COME UP MY DEAR MALTBOY OH IT IS DEAR GOOD MISTER MALTBOY ADDED A VOICE QUALIFIED BY SOBS
THE CREDITORS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SUSPICIOUSLY A WANT OF THAT CHILDLIKE TRUST WHICH IN A PERFECT STATE OF SOCIETY SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WAS UNHAPPILY TOO APPARENT
HE WHIPPED OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND DELIVERED OVER FIVE TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECES TO MISTER WHEDELL THE SIGHT OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL COINS SEEMED TO RECONCILE THE WRETCHED MAN TO LIFE
HOT DOG RAY RAY AND THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT MOOSICK MOOSICK MOO SICK THE AUDIENCE STAMPED AND ROARED WHISTLED AND HOWLED
LET'S WALK FOR A WHILE YEAH IT WAS PRETTY GOOD CARL ADMITTED NOPE I CAN'T GO WALKING GOTTA WRITE A LETTER WHO TO THE HAREM
IT WOULD GIVE US TIME CAN'T COME IT NO GO NOW OR NEVER WERE SOME OF THE EXCLAMATIONS WHICH WENT UP FROM THE EXCITED CROWD
CARL HUNCHED HIS SHOULDERS UNTIL HIS EARS TOUCHED HIS COAT COLLAR GETTIN COLD FALL'S HERE NOPE NOT THE HAREM MY OLD LADY
MISTER WHEDELL WAS ABOUT TO THANK HIS PRESERVER MOST PROFUSELY AND MISSUS CHIFFIELD TO BURST INTO A NEW TORRENT WHEN MATTHEW TO AVOID THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ROSE OPENED THE DOOR
THE OTHER OFFICER STATIONED HIMSELF AT THE BACK DOOR TO CARRY OUT A SIMILAR POLICY AT THAT POINT
DREW HIS HEAD LIKE A SCARED TURTLE DOWN INTO HIS COAT COLLAR AND RAN FOR A SEAT HUGH AND CARL TUCKED THEIR CAPS INTO THEIR COAT POCKETS AND ATTEMPTED TO STROLL NONCHALANTLY DOWN THE AISLE
MY ADVISER WAS A GOOD SCOUT AND WISED ME UP THIS P C ISN'T PAPER CUTTING AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE IT'S GYM YOU'LL GET OUT OF THAT BY SIGNING UP FOR TRACK
HUGH FRANKLY SO GOLLY I DID ENJOY THAT HE EXCLAIMED I NEVER HAD A BETTER TIME IT WAS SURE HOT STUFF I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE ROOM
WHEN MATTHEW WAS IN STRONG DOUBT WHAT TO DO IN ANY CASE IT WAS HIS INVARIABLE CUSTOM TO POSTPONE I THINK HE FEEBLY SUGGESTED THAT WE HAD BETTER POSTPONE FINAL ACTION SAY TILL THREE P M
BUT THAT THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS HUGH WAS IN A DILEMMA HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OUT OF HIS CARD HERE SAID CARL GIVE THE THING TO ME
I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE SAID QUIGG THAT THE COUNSEL OF MISTER WHEDELL ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ORNAMENTS OF THE BAR HAS NOW ARRIVED AND WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIS CLIENT'S AFFAIRS
SUPPOSE YOU APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO DISPOSE OF THIS PROPERTY WHICH MY CLIENT GENEROUSLY CRIES OF OH OH TURNS OVER TO YOU AND DIVIDE THE PROCEEDS AMONG YOURSELVES PRO RATA
THEREFORE I SAY LET THE CREDITORS EMPLOY AN AUCTIONEER HANG OUT THE RED FLAG SELL AND DIVIDE BEFORE THAT PERIOD ARRIVES THE LARGE CREDITORS WERE SILENT
SHE'S HIDING BEHIND THE DOOR HAROLD NO NO NOT THAT WAY HEY DUMBBELL BEHIND THE DOOR CATCH HIM GLORIA HE'S ONLY SHY
HE THEREFORE PULLED OUT HIS WATCH AND INFORMED MISTER WHEDELL THAT THIRTEEN OF THE FIFTEEN MINUTES WERE CONSUMED
THE IDEA TOOK ONLY A FEW OF THE LARGER CREDITORS HOLDING OUT AGAINST IT MY FRIENDS AGAIN OBSERVED MATTHEW DRAWING ON HIS STORES OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT
IMMEDIATELY THE BOYS BEGAN TO WHISTLE AND AS THE COMEDY WAS UTTERLY STUPID THEY RELIEVED THEIR BOREDOM BY WHISTLING THE VARIOUS TUNES THAT THE PIANIST PLAYED UNTIL THE MISERABLE FILM
THAT MISSUS CHIFFIELD OBTAINED A DIVORCE FROM THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY BUT HAD NOT MARRIED AGAIN AT LAST ACCOUNTS
P C MEANS PHYSICAL CULTURE THINK OF THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR TRACK ANY TIME TO MORROW DOWN AT THE GYM
GOOD NEWS SAID HE MISTER ABERNUCKLE THE OWNER OF THESE PREMISES WHO WAS INTENDING TO MOVE IN TO DAY WRITES THAT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE POSSESSION UNTIL NOON TO MORROW
AND THAT THAT WAS NO DOUBT WHAT THE COLONEL HAD MEANT TO IMPLY BY THE WORDS HE WILL BE WORTHY OF IT WORDS WHICH MARIUS CONTINUED TO WEAR NOT ON HIS BREAST SINCE THE COLONEL'S WRITING HAD DISAPPEARED BUT IN HIS HEART
A CLOCK DOES NOT STOP SHORT AT THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN THE KEY IS LOST
CHAPTER TWO EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS JAVERT'S TRIUMPH IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL SEEMED COMPLETE BUT HAD NOT BEEN SO IN THE FIRST PLACE
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE INCLINED A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO THE SIDE OF CONTEMPLATION FROM THE DAY WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EARNING HIS LIVING WITH SOME APPROACH TO CERTAINTY HE HAD STOPPED THINKING IT GOOD TO BE POOR
WITHOUT DISTINCTION PROVIDED THEY LEFT HIM IN PEACE AS THE GREEKS CALLED THE FURIES THE BEAUTIFUL THE GOOD THE CHARMING
WERE ADMITTED TO VIEW THE THATCHED COTTAGE AT AUSTERLITZ A BRAWLING NAME WHICH WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE TO HIM HOWEVER AS WE HAVE JUST POINTED OUT BRAINS WHICH ARE ABSORBED IN SOME BIT OF WISDOM OR FOLLY
WHEN EPONINE CAME OUT MAGNON WHO WAS WATCHING THE GATE OF THE MADELONETTES HANDED HER BRUJON'S NOTE TO BABET CHARGING HER TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER
FLOWERS CHILDREN THE HUMANITY AMONG WHICH HE IS SUFFERING THE CREATION AMID WHICH HE BEAMS HE GAZES SO MUCH ON HUMANITY THAT HE PERCEIVES ITS SOUL HE GAZES UPON CREATION TO SUCH AN EXTENT
IF HE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION WOULD BECOME BOTH BETTER AND WORSE AT THE SAME TIME HE ACQUIRED COMFORT AND LOST HIS DIGNITY IT WAS A FINE AND COMPLETE UNHAPPINESS CONVERTED INTO A REPULSIVE AND RIDICULOUS STATE OF TORTURE
UPON WHOM THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE WAS DIRECTED BY THIS INCIDENT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THESE MEN WERE MEMBERS OF PATRON MINETTE TWO OF THOSE LEADERS
THIS NAME OF BRUJON IS ONE OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LA FORCE IN THAT HIDEOUS COURTYARD
THE FIRST YOUNG LAD WHO COMES TO HAND HOWEVER POOR HE MAY BE WITH HIS STRENGTH HIS HEALTH HIS RAPID WALK HIS BRILLIANT EYES HIS WARMLY CIRCULATING BLOOD HIS BLACK HAIR HIS RED LIPS HIS WHITE TEETH HIS PURE BREATH
MOTHER PLUTARQUE CAME TO THIS PHRASE IT WAS A QUESTION OF AN OFFICER OF DRAGOONS AND A BEAUTY THE BEAUTY POUTED AND THE DRAGOON HERE SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF TO WIPE HER GLASSES
THAT HE BEHOLDS GOD HE DREAMS HE FEELS HIMSELF GREAT HE DREAMS ON AND FEELS HIMSELF TENDER FROM THE EGOTISM OF THE MAN WHO SUFFERS HE PASSES TO THE COMPASSION OF THE MAN WHO MEDITATES AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT BREAKS FORTH IN HIM
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS REMOVAL TO SELL OFF NEARLY ALL HIS FURNITURE ON THE DAY OF HIS ENTRANCE INTO HIS NEW QUARTERS HE WAS VERY GAY AND DROVE THE NAILS ON WHICH HIS ENGRAVINGS AND HERBARIUMS WERE TO HANG WITH HIS OWN HANDS
HER GLORY CONSISTED IN HER CAPS WHICH WERE ALWAYS WHITE SHE PASSED HER TIME ON SUNDAYS AFTER MASS IN COUNTING OVER THE LINEN IN HER CHEST
BUT THE AWAKENING IS TARDY IN THE MEANTIME IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HELD OURSELVES NEUTRAL IN THE GAME WHICH IS GOING ON BETWEEN OUR HAPPINESS AND OUR UNHAPPINESS WE ARE THE STAKE AND WE LOOK ON AT THE GAME WITH INDIFFERENCE
THE BLOOD DRINKER DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE I COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN TURN HIM OUT SAID THE GRANDFATHER TO HIMSELF AND HE ASKED HIMSELF IF THE THING WERE TO DO OVER AGAIN WOULD I DO IT
AND ALL THE WHILE SECRETLY REGRETTED THAT HE WAS SO WELL OBEYED AT FIRST
WERE SITUATED THE DOMICILES OF THE THREE VERY REDOUBTABLE PROWLERS OF THE BARRIERS KRUIDENIERS ALIAS BIZARRE
HE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO BECOME USELESS HAVING BOOKS DID NOT PREVENT HIS READING BEING A BOTANIST DID NOT PREVENT HIS BEING A GARDENER WHEN HE MADE PONTMERCY'S ACQUAINTANCE
THE AIR OF AN OLD SHEEP AND HE WAS EASILY FRIGHTENED ADD TO THIS THAT HE HAD NO OTHER FRIENDSHIP NO OTHER ACQUAINTANCE AMONG THE LIVING
HE HAD LONG PASSED SIXTY WHEN ONE DAY SOME ONE ASKED HIM HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN MARRIED I HAVE FORGOTTEN SAID HE WHEN IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED TO HIM AND TO WHOM DOES IT NOT HAPPEN TO SAY OH
MONSIEUR SAID MOTHER PLUTARQUE SADLY IT IS THE WATER CARRIER IN SHORT ONE DAY
TO READ ALOUD IS TO ASSURE ONE'S SELF OF WHAT ONE IS READING THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO READ VERY LOUD AND WHO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF GIVING THEMSELVES THEIR WORD OF HONOR AS TO WHAT THEY ARE PERUSING
AND WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP HIS AGED FINGERS STIFFENED WITH RHEUMATISM LAY CROOKED UP IN THE FOLDS OF HIS SHEETS HE HAD COMPOSED AND PUBLISHED A FLORA OF THE ENVIRONS OF CAUTERETZ WITH COLORED PLATES
HENCE INEXPRESSIBLE BOUNDS TOWARDS THE IDEAL LIFE THE WEALTHY YOUNG MAN HAS A HUNDRED COARSE AND BRILLIANT DISTRACTIONS HORSE RACES HUNTING DOGS TOBACCO GAMING
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MEN COULD BUSY THEMSELVES WITH HATING EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF SILLY STUFF LIKE THE CHARTER DEMOCRACY LEGITIMACY MONARCHY THE REPUBLIC ET CETERA WHEN THERE WERE IN THE WORLD
WHO HAD BEEN SO PRECIOUS A CAPTURE FOR THE RUFFIANS WOULD BE NO LESS FINE A PRIZE FOR THE AUTHORITIES AND THEN
TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY TO ASK FOR IT HE DREW AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR FROM IT THIS CONSTITUTED NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS FORTUNE
IF IT WERE THE OUTCOME OF REASONING WOULD RESEMBLE PHILOSOPHY ONE DECLINES DESCENDS TRICKLES AWAY EVEN CRUMBLES AWAY AND YET IS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF IT ONE'S SELF IT ALWAYS ENDS IT IS TRUE IN AN AWAKENING
THAT THEY MADE US THEIR HEIRS KNOWING WELL THAT THEY WERE NEAR THEIR END AND IN FACT ONLY A FEW DAYS PASSED BEFORE WE HEARD OF THE DISASTER WHICH WE HAD FORESEEN THESE POOR PEOPLE FELL INTO AMBUSCADES OF OUR IROQUOIS ENEMIES
WHICH AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS IS THE HOUSE WHEREIN SAINT JOSEPH DWELT WITH HIS VIRGIN SPOUSE AND WHICH ANGELS BORE THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE HOLY LAND TO ITALY
THIRTY SEVEN OF THEIR BEST WARRIORS AT LENGTH CAME OVER IN A BODY TO THE HURON VILLAGE ETIENNE'S TIME HAD COME HE AND THE CHIEFS WHO WERE IN THE SECRET GAVE THE WORD TO THE HURON WARRIORS WHO AT A SIGNAL RAISED THE WAR WHOOP
HAS NO INK BLACK ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE FURY OF THE IROQUOIS
SOME WOULD DISPERSE IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE FORESTS OTHERS WOULD TAKE REFUGE IN A DISTANT SPOT APPARENTLY THE GRAND MANITOULIN ISLAND
THIS CALAMITY WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WHEN THE BEST OF THE HURON WARRIORS INCLUDING THEIR LEADER THE CRAFTY AND VALIANT ETIENNE ANNAOTAHA WERE SLAIN
HE PREPARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN THEY CALLED OUT TO HIM THAT THEY CAME NOT AS ENEMIES BUT AS FRIENDS AND THAT THEY BROUGHT WAMPUM BELTS AND PRESENTS TO PERSUADE THE HURONS TO FORGET THE PAST
THE FRENCH ROWED AFTER THEM AND SOON BECAME SEPARATED IN THE CHASE WHEREUPON THE IROQUOIS TURNED AND MADE DESPERATE FIGHT WITH THE FOREMOST RETREATING AGAIN AS SOON AS THE OTHERS CAME UP
AND MADE THEM A PREY TO MISERY TORTURE AND A CRUEL DEATH IN A WORD THEY ARE A PEOPLE SWEPT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT AS THEY DIED CHRISTIANS
ONE OF THESE A HURON SUDDENLY FELL IN WITH A LARGE IROQUOIS WAR PARTY AND SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FORMED ON THE INSTANT A VILLANOUS PLAN TO SAVE HIMSELF HE RAN TOWARDS THE ENEMY CRYING OUT
NOT LONG AFTER HE CAME TO CANADA AND WITH A VIEW AS IT WAS THOUGHT TO SOME FURTHER TREACHERY REJOINED THE FRENCH A SHARP CROSS QUESTIONING PUT HIM TO CONFUSION
GRADUALLY THEY RALLIED FROM THEIR DEJECTION AND THE MISSION SETTLEMENT WAS BEGINNING TO WEAR AN APPEARANCE OF THRIFT WHEN IN SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX THE IROQUOIS MADE A DESCENT UPON THEM AND CARRIED OFF A LARGE NUMBER OF CAPTIVES
WITH A CHAPEL AND A SMALL HOUSE FOR THE MISSIONARIES
THEY AGAIN CHANGED THEIR ABODE AND UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE JESUITS WHO OWNED THE LAND SETTLED AT OLD LORETTE NINE MILES FROM QUEBEC
FOR THE HURONS THEMSELVES WERE NO LESS DECEIVED THAN WERE THE IROQUOIS ENVOYS DURING ONE OR TWO SUCCEEDING DAYS MANY MESSAGES AND VISITS PASSED BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE IROQUOIS WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS SUCH THAT
NOTHING REMAINING OF THE ALGONQUINS WHO DWELT ON ITS SHORE EXCEPT THE ASHES OF THEIR BURNT WIGWAMS A LITTLE FARTHER ON THERE WAS A FORT BUILT OF TREES WHERE THE IROQUOIS WHO MADE THIS DESOLATION HAD SPENT THE WINTER
THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE STONE FORT WHICH THE FRENCH HAD ABANDONED AND WHERE WITH REASONABLE VIGILANCE THEY COULD MAINTAIN THEMSELVES AGAINST ATTACK IN THE SUCCEEDING AUTUMN A SMALL IROQUOIS WAR PARTY HAD THE AUDACITY TO CROSS OVER TO THE ISLAND
HAD BEEN SHARED IN AN EQUAL DEGREE BY SMALLER BANDS WHO HAD WINTERED IN REMOTE AND SECRET RETREATS OF THE WILDERNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT SEASON OF DEATH MANY WERE SO WEAKENED
AND PROMISED TO CHANGE THEIR NATIONALITY AND TURN SENECAS AS THE PRICE OF THEIR LIVES THE VICTORS ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL AND THE INHABITANTS OF THESE TWO TOWNS JOINED BY A FEW OTHER HURONS
AND WHERE THE SUNLIGHT STRUGGLES THROUGH MATTED BOUGHS OF THE PINE AND FIR TO BASK FOR BRIEF MOMENTS ON THE MOSSY ROCKS OR FLASH ON THE HURRYING WATERS ON A PLATEAU BESIDE THE TORRENT ANOTHER CHAPEL WAS BUILT TO OUR LADY
MIGRATED IN A BODY TO THE SENECA COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT DISTRIBUTED AMONG DIFFERENT VILLAGES BUT WERE ALLOWED TO FORM A TOWN BY THEMSELVES
AND LIVE WITH THEM AS ONE NATION ETIENNE SUSPECTED TREACHERY BUT CONCEALED HIS DISTRUST AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE IROQUOIS WITH AN AIR OF THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THEY RECEIVED HIM WITH OPEN ARMS AND PRESSED HIM TO ACCEPT THEIR INVITATION
AND A LEAGUE OR TWO BELOW THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR FORT THE RIVER OTTAWA WAS A SOLITUDE THE ALGONQUINS OF ALLUMETTE ISLAND AND THE SHORES ADJACENT HAD ALL BEEN KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN
WHEN HE REACHED THE VILLAGE HE GAVE THE WHOOP OF ONE WHO BRINGS GOOD TIDINGS AND PROCLAIMED WITH A LOUD VOICE THAT THE HEARTS OF THEIR ENEMIES HAD CHANGED THAT THE IROQUOIS WOULD BECOME THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND BROTHERS
WHERE A REMNANT OF THEM MAY STILL BE FOUND
POINT SAINT IGNACE NOW GRAHAM'S POINT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STRAIT
ON THE BEST THAT THE VILLAGE COULD SUPPLY ETIENNE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ASIDE FOUR OR FIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFS AND SECRETLY TELL THEM HIS SUSPICIONS THAT THE IROQUOIS WERE PLOTTING
DO NOT WAIT TILL WAR AND FAMINE HAVE DESTROYED US TO THE LAST MAN WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS DEATH HAS TAKEN FROM YOU MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF US IF YOU WAIT LONGER NOT ONE WILL REMAIN ALIVE AND THEN YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT SAVE THOSE
BUT AT LENGTH THEY TOO WERE COMPELLED TO FLY TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER HURONS AS HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH THEM THEY MADE THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND SETTLED ON THE ISLAND OF MICHILIMACKINAC WHERE THEY WERE JOINED BY THE OTTAWAS WHO WITH OTHER ALGONQUINS
WHERE THEY REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DESCENDED THE OTTAWA AND REJOINED THEIR COUNTRYMEN WHO HAD GONE TO QUEBEC THE YEAR BEFORE THESE UNITED PARTIES JOINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY A FEW OTHER FUGITIVES
THEY MET WITH EMBRACES AND REJOICING BRESSANI AND HIS FRENCHMEN HAD COME TOO LATE ALL WAS OVER WITH THE HURONS AND THE HURON MISSION AND AS IT WAS USELESS TO GO FARTHER THEY JOINED RAGUENEAU'S PARTY AND RETRACED THEIR COURSE FOR THE SETTLEMENTS
YET GOD BLESSED ALL THAT WAS TRUE IN THEIR WORK AND IT IS FROM THE HEBREW COPIES WHICH THEY MADE OF THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND NOT FROM THE SEPTUAGINT OR GREEK TRANSLATION THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT OF OUR BIBLE
HE SUBMITTED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM US WHO WERE UNDER THE LAW IN THESE WORDS THE APOSTLE EXPLAINS THE PERSON AND OFFICE OF CHRIST HIS PERSON IS DIVINE AND HUMAN GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON MADE OF A WOMAN
BECAUSE THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JUSTIFICATION IF IT THRUSTS ITS NOSE INTO THE BUSINESS OF JUSTIFICATION WE MUST TALK HARSHLY TO THE LAW TO KEEP IT IN ITS PLACE THE CONSCIENCE OUGHT NOT TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THE LAW
THE CARE THEY TOOK TO KEEP THE WORDS EXACTLY AS THEY HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN TO THEM WAS INFINITE AND GOD WHO KNOWS ALL THINGS KNEW THAT A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE PURE HEBREW WORDS OF THE OLD BIBLE WOULD BE EAGERLY SOUGHT FOR
THE FIFTH LINE AND FIRST SPACE REPRESENT THE PITCH F BUT IN FIG TEN B THESE SAME STAFF DEGREES REPRESENT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TONE F SHARP THE STUDENT SHOULD NOTE THAT THE SHARP DOES NOT THEN RAISE ANYTHING
TO PREACH DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES AND RECOVERING OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND TO SET AT LIBERTY THEM THAT ARE BRUISED TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD LUKE
FOR INSTANCE OUR NAME OF MARY BECOMES MARIE IN FRENCH AND MARIA IN ITALIAN AND YET IT IS ALL THE WHILE THE SAME NAME SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS THE SEPTUAGINT
WHO IS THE END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVETH ROMANS ONE FOUR CHRIST RELIEVES THE CONSCIENCE OF THE LAW IN SO FAR AS THE LAW IMPELS US TO CHRIST IT RENDERS EXCELLENT SERVICE
NINETEEN HE CLOSES THE BOOK AND SITS DOWN FROM THE DIM AGES OF THE PAST THOSE WORDS HAD BEEN READ IN THE LONG LONG AGES TO COME THEY WILL YET BE READ UNTIL THE WORLD SHALL CEASE TO EXIST
AND WORTHY OF EVERLASTING DEATH HAVE ON GOD AND ETERNAL LIFE THAT GOD ADOPTED US IS DUE TO THE MERIT OF JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WHO HUMBLED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW AND REDEEMED US LAW RIDDEN SINNERS
HIS PRESENT MASTERY OVER THE LAW WAS OBTAINED BY VIRTUE OF HIS SONSHIP AND HIS SUBSTITUTIONARY VICTORY THUS CHRIST BANISHED THE LAW FROM THE CONSCIENCE IT DARE NO LONGER BANISH US FROM GOD FOR THAT MATTER
TWENTY TWO HENCE THE LAW HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER HIM YET THE LAW TREATED THIS INNOCENT JUST AND BLESSED LAMB OF GOD AS CRUELLY AS IT TREATED US IT ACCUSED HIM OF BLASPHEMY AND TREASON
SO WROTE THE APOSTLE PAUL WHO HAD AS WE KNOW BEEN EDUCATED BY THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES AND WHEN HE WROTE THOSE WORDS HE WAS RECALLING HIS OWN EXPERIENCE
AS SUCH TIMES WE ARE TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST AS IF THERE WERE NO LAW OR SIN ANYWHERE BUT ONLY CHRIST WE OUGHT TO SAY TO THE LAW MISTER LAW I DO NOT GET YOU YOU STUTTER SO MUCH
OUTWARDLY THERE IS NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHRISTIAN AND ANY HONEST MAN THE ACTIVITIES OF A CHRISTIAN ARE NOT SENSATIONAL HE PERFORMS HIS DUTY ACCORDING TO HIS VOCATION HE TAKES GOOD CARE OF HIS FAMILY AND IS KIND AND HELPFUL TO OTHERS
THE FULLNESS OF THE TIME MEANS WHEN THE TIME OF THE LAW WAS FULFILLED AND CHRIST WAS REVEALED NOTE HOW PAUL EXPLAINS CHRIST CHRIST SAYS HE IS THE SON OF GOD AND THE SON OF A WOMAN
SUCH HOMELY EVERYDAY PERFORMANCES ARE NOT MUCH ADMIRED BUT THE SETTING UP EXERCISES OF THE MONKS DRAW GREAT APPLAUSE HOLY WORKS YOU KNOW ONLY THE ACTS OF A CHRISTIAN ARE TRULY GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE TO GOD
I AM ALL RIGHT WITH GOD I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST CHRIST IN WHOM I DO BELIEVE MAKES ME WORTHY I GLADLY HEAR READ SING AND WRITE OF HIM
CHRIST HIMSELF NO DOUBT
HIS HEARERS OF COURSE HAD HEARD THESE WORDS QUOTED FROM CHILDHOOD BUT NOT TILL THE SAVIOUR EXPLAINED THEIR FULL SIGNIFICANCE GOD IS NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD BUT OF THE LIVING DID THEY REALIZE
LET US UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAW AND CHRIST ARE IMPOSSIBLE BEDFELLOWS THE LAW MUST LEAVE THE BED OF THE CONSCIENCE WHICH IS SO NARROW THAT IT CANNOT HOLD TWO AS ISAIAH SAYS CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT VERSE TWENTY ONLY PAUL AMONG THE APOSTLES
THAT IN THE FIRST RECORDED WORDS SPOKEN BY GOD TO MOSES LAY A PROOF OF THE RESURRECTION AND OF LIFE AFTER DEATH LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST TIME IN WHICH CHRIST PUBLICLY READ AND EXPLAINED THE SCRIPTURES
INDEED NOT UNTIL THE GREEK TRANSLATION WAS MADE WERE THE BOOKS GROUPED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH WE HAVE THEM NOW AND AT THE SAME TIME THEIR NUMBER WAS INCREASED TO THIRTY NINE BY TAKING THE WRITINGS OF EACH OF THE PROPHETS SEPARATELY
THAT I SHOULD EVER BE SO ARROGANT AS TO THINK THAT I STAND IN GRACE THAT I AM HOLY OR THAT I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST WE OUGHT TO FEEL SURE THAT WE STAND IN THE GRACE OF GOD NOT IN VIEW OF OUR OWN WORTHINESS
OUR IMPROVED SPEECH AND OUR UNASHAMED CONFESSION OF CHRIST FORMERLY WE DID NOT CONFESS CHRIST TO BE OUR ONLY MERIT AS WE DO NOW IN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL
SO LONG AS HE SITS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD TO INTERCEDE FOR US WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE ANGER OF GOD THIS INNER ASSURANCE OF THE GRACE OF GOD IS ACCOMPANIED BY OUTWARD INDICATIONS SUCH AS GLADLY TO HEAR
BUT WHEN THE FULLNESS OF THE TIME WAS COME GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON MADE OF A WOMAN MADE UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW
BUT FEW OF THEM HAVE CLAIMED THAT RIGHT OR HAVE EVEN KNOWN THAT IT HAS EXISTED IT DOES EXIST HOWEVER AND WAS SPECIFICALLY DECLARED BY THE NEW YORK STATE COURT OF APPEALS AS WE SHALL SEE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT COURT'S OPINION IN THE SANGER CASE FARTHER ON IN THE BOOK
SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL OBSCENITY ACT THIS ACT WAS PRESENTED AS ONE TO PREVENT THE CIRCULATION OF PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE AND PICTURES AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN AS SUCH
WHEN HE SEIZED A HEAVY STICK AND BEAT ME WITH IT IN A SHAMEFUL MANNER AGAIN I WENT HOME SORE AND BLEEDING BUT WITH PRIDE AS STRONG AND DEFIANT AS EVER THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY MISTER BINGHAM AGAIN TRIED TO CONQUER ME BUT IN VAIN WE STRUGGLED
AN ABORTION IS AS IMPORTANT A MATTER AS A CONFINEMENT AND REQUIRES AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THE BIRTH OF A CHILD AT ITS FULL TERM THE IMMEDIATE DANGERS OF ABORTION SAYS DOCTOR J CLIFTON EDGAR IN HIS BOOK THE PRACTICE OF OBSTETRICS
HAS NO CHILDREN AT ALL OR A SMALL FAMILY THE FAMILY OF THE JUDGE WHO PASSES UPON THE CASE IS LIKELY TO BE SMALLER STILL THE WORDS IT IS THE LAW SUMS IT ALL UP FOR THESE OFFICIALS WHEN THEY PASS SENTENCE IN COURT
PHYSICIANS INSTRUMENTS AND INFORMATION AN ARTICLE OR INSTRUMENT USED OR APPLIED BY PHYSICIANS LAWFULLY PRACTICING OR BY THEIR DIRECTION OR PRESCRIPTION FOR THE CURE OR PREVENTION OF DISEASE
COMSTOCK HAS PASSED OUT OF PUBLIC NOTICE HIS BODY HAS BEEN ENTOMBED BUT THE EVIL THAT HE DID LIVES AFTER HIM
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME I WAS IN QUITE A TROUBLE I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER MY FROCK WAS CLEAN OR DIRTY I ONLY HAD A WEEK'S NOTICE AND THE BODY AND SLEEVES TO MAKE AND ONLY ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT TO WORK ON IT
OF INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES IN THAT YEAR HOWEVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NEW YORK PASSED AN ACT WHICH SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED THE SUBJECT OF CONTRACEPTIVES
SEVERAL OF THESE SPERM CELLS START BUT ONLY ONE ENTERS THE OVUM AND IS ABSORBED INTO IT THIS PROCESS IS CALLED FERTILIZATION CONCEPTION OR IMPREGNATION IF NO CHILDREN ARE DESIRED THE MEETING OF THE MALE SPERM AND THE OVUM MUST BE PREVENTED
THIS IS CALLED THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD IT OCCURS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH OR EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IN THE MALE ORGANS THERE ARE GLANDS CALLED TESTES THEY SECRETE A FLUID CALLED THE SEMEN IN THE SEMEN IS THE LIFE GIVING PRINCIPLE CALLED THE SPERM
SUFFERING AND DEATH WHICH SO OFTEN FOLLOWS HE WHO WOULD COMBAT ABORTION SAYS DOCTOR HIRSCH AND AT THE SAME TIME COMBAT CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES MAY BE LIKENED TO THE PERSON WHO WOULD FIGHT CONTAGIOUS DISEASES AND FORBID DISINFECTION
AND I STOOD LIKE A STATUE WHILE THE KEEN LASH CUT DEEP INTO MY FLESH AS SOON AS I WAS RELEASED STUNNED WITH PAIN BRUISED AND BLEEDING I WENT HOME AND RUSHED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PASTOR AND HIS WIFE WILDLY EXCLAIMING MASTER ROBERT
WHEN INTERCOURSE TAKES PLACE IF NO PREVENTIVE IS EMPLOYED THE SEMEN IS DEPOSITED IN THE WOMAN'S VAGINA THE OVULE IS NOT IN THE VAGINA BUT IS IN THE WOMB FARTHER UP OR PERHAPS IN THE TUBE ON ITS WAY TO THE WOMB
CHAPTER TEN CONTRACEPTIVES OR ABORTION SOCIETY HAS NOT YET LEARNED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AGE LONG EFFORT OF THE FEMININE SPIRIT TO FREE ITSELF OF THE BURDEN OF EXCESSIVE CHILDBEARING
THE AROUSING OF PUBLIC CONSCIENCE HAVE ALL OPERATED TO GIVE FORCE AND VOLUME TO THE DEMAND FOR WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN BODY THAT SHE MAY WORK OUT HER OWN SALVATION THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN STRICTLY LEGAL MEASURES AS WELL AS THOSE WHO BELIEVE BOTH IN LEGAL MEASURES
IS THE CHANGING OF OUR SO CALLED OBSCENITY LAWS THIS WILL BE NO EASY UNDERTAKING IT IS USUALLY MUCH EASIER TO ENACT STATUTES THAN TO REVISE THEM LAWS ARE SELDOM EXACTLY WHAT THEY SEEM RARELY WHAT THEIR ADVOCATES CLAIM FOR THEM
AND SAID NO MISTER BINGHAM I SHALL NOT TAKE DOWN MY DRESS BEFORE YOU MOREOVER YOU SHALL NOT WHIP ME UNLESS YOU PROVE THE STRONGER NOBODY HAS A RIGHT TO WHIP ME BUT MY OWN MASTER AND NOBODY SHALL DO SO IF I CAN PREVENT IT
IT IS ONLY THE WOMEN OF WEALTH WHO CAN AFFORD THE BEST MEDICAL SKILL CARE AND TREATMENT
I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I LIVED WHERE I KNEW I NEVER COULD SEE YOU FOR THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE MY HOPES RAISED AND TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MANNER HOWEVER IT IS SAID THAT A BAD BEGINNING MAKES A GOOD ENDING
THE GIVING BY A DULY LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR REGISTERED NURSE LAWFULLY PRACTICING OF INFORMATION OR ADVICE IN REGARD TO OR THE SUPPLYING TO ANY PERSON OF ANY ARTICLE OR MEDICINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION
WHO UNDERGO THE AGONY OF ABORTION EACH YEAR THIS HAND REACHES OUT TO COMPEL THE BIRTH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INFANTS WHO MUST DIE BEFORE THEY ARE TWELVE MONTHS OLD LIKE MANY LAWS UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS THESE ARE BEING PERSISTENTLY AND INTELLIGENTLY VIOLATED
I MUST PASS RAPIDLY OVER THE STIRRING EVENTS OF MY EARLY LIFE WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD I WENT TO LIVE WITH MY MASTER'S ELDEST SON A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER
TO REFORGE OUR CHAINS WHEN WE HAVE BROKEN THEM TO ARREST PROGRESS IT IS THE HAND OF SUCH AS HAVE LIVED ON EARTH BUT HAVE NOT LOVED HUMANITY AT THE CALL OF THOSE WHO FEAR PROGRESS AND FREEDOM IT RISES FROM THE GLOOM OF FORGOTTEN THINGS TO OPPRESS THE LIVING
IN THIS WAY THEY ESCAPE THE USUAL SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THE WOMEN WHOSE INCOMES ARE LIMITED AND WHO MUST CONTINUE AT WORK BEFORE THEY HAVE RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF AN ABORTION ARE THE GREAT ARMY OF SUFFERERS IT IS AMONG SUCH THAT THE DEATHS DUE TO ABORTION USUALLY ENSUE
WHY DID YOU LET MISTER BINGHAM FLOG ME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT I SHOULD BE SO PUNISHED
AND TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE MARSFIELD AND IF YOU HAVE SEEN ANY OF OLD ACQUAINTANCES
IS IN THIS DIRECTION THESE LAWS WERE MADE BY MEN AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTS OF MARTYRDOM AND DEATH FOR UNNUMBERED THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WOMEN NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWEEP THEM INTO THE TRASH HEAP THEY WILL DO IT AT ONCE UNLESS LIKE MEN
NORTH CAROLINA HILLSBORO APRIL TENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT MY DEAR MOTHER
THE ACT MADE IT EXACTLY AS GREAT AN OFFENSE TO GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS TO EXHIBIT THE SORT OF PICTURES AND WRITINGS AT WHICH THE LEGISLATION WAS OSTENSIBLY AIMED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE THE LATE ANTHONY COMSTOCK
I WAS TOO PROUD TO LET MY TORMENTOR KNOW WHAT I WAS SUFFERING
IS NOT AN ARTICLE OF INDECENT OR IMMORAL NATURE OR USE WITHIN THIS ARTICLE THE SUPPLYING OF SUCH ARTICLES TO SUCH PHYSICIANS OR BY THEIR DIRECTION OR PRESCRIPTION IS NOT AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS ARTICLE
IN THAT CASE MISSUS FISHER OLD MISTER KING LOOKED DOWN THE TABLE LENGTH TO MAMSIE WE MUST GO TOO FOR I DON'T INTEND TO LOSE SIGHT OF THESE NICE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS UNTIL I AM OBLIGED TO TOM'S FACE WAS ONE BIG SMILE

OF WHICH THEY NEVER TIRED OR RESTING ON THE BENCHES UNDER THE PLANE AND WALNUT TREES OPPOSITE THEIR HOTEL JUST SITTING STILL TO GAZE THEIR FILL UPON THE JUNGFRAU THIS WAS BEST OF ALL SO POLLY AND JASPER THOUGHT
LOOKING OUT FROM THE BIG PIAZZA CROWDED WITH THE HOTEL PEOPLE OUT TO THE ROAD IN FRONT WITH EVERY IMAGINABLE TOURIST PASSING AND REPASSING DONKEYS WERE BEING DRIVEN UP EITHER LOADED DOWN TO THEIR UTMOST WITH HEAVY BAGS AND TRUNKS
AND PHRONSIE WAS CONTENT TO PASS HOUR AFTER HOUR THERE BY GRANDPAPA'S SIDE AND IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF PRETTY PICTURES AND STORIES IN AND ABOUT THE SNOW CLAD HEIGHTS OF THE MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN AND THE THRONG OF GAILY DRESSED PEOPLE SOJOURNING IN THE BIG HOTELS
I WISH WE COULD STAY AT THIS NICE PLACE SAID PHRONSIE THE NEXT MORNING POKING HER HEAD OUT OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAR AS IT CLIMBED OFF FROM THE RIFFELALP STATION
FOR HAVING THAT CHILD AS COMPANY AND THOSE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE YOU SAY THE TRUTH REPLIED OLD MISTER KING CORDIALLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART I PITY ANY ONE WHO HASN'T SOME CHILDREN TO TAKE ALONG WHEN GOING ABROAD BUT THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE LITTLE PEPPERS HE ADDED
AND TOOK SEVERAL HASTY STRIDES UP AND DOWN THE PIAZZA WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT PHRONSIE HE SAID COMING BACK TO GET ASTRIDE THE RAILING AGAIN THIS TIME HE TURNED A COLD SHOULDER ON PHRONSIE'S WHITE NEEDLE NOW TO MORROW WE'LL HAVE NO END OF FUN
AND AS HE COULDN'T BE TURNED FROM IT AND HIS HEALTH IS PRECARIOUS IF HE IS EXCITED WHY THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT AND THEN HE INSISTED THAT TOM AND I COME OFF FOR A BIT OF A RUN ON THE CONTINENT THE OTHER CHILDREN BEING WITH HIM AND AS MY BIG BOY
AT SCHOOL IN PARIS AND THEY ARE QUITE NICE OH I MEAN YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT ON COARSE WOOLLEN ONES THAT THE PEASANT WOMEN KNIT ON PURPOSE WE ALL SHALL HAVE TO DO THE SAME ON OVER OUR SHOES EXPLAINED JASPER
AND THAT WAS ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET LOWER OH GRANDPAPA EXCLAIMED PHRONSIE IN GENTLE SURPRISE UNABLE TO COMPASS SUCH FIGURES MISTER KING'S PARTY HAD MADE ONE OR TWO PLEASANT LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE LAUTERBRUNNEN VALLEY STAYING THERE AND AT MUERREN
SHE BROKE OFF ABRUPTLY THE PLACID LOOK WAS GONE AGAIN IN A FLASH YES SAID MOTHER FISHER HER BLACK EYES FULL OF SYMPATHY DON'T LET THAT TROUBLE YOU DEAR MISSUS SELWYN TOM WAS PURE GOLD DOWN UNDERNEATH WE SAW THAT AND THE REST IS PAST
MISSUS SELWYN UNCLASPED HERS SOFT AND WHITE TO DRAW WITHIN THEM THE TOIL WORN ONE NOW THAT'S COMFORTABLE SHE SAID WITH ANOTHER LITTLE SMILE AND HERE IS WHERE HIS ECCENTRICITY BECAME THE MOST DANGEROUS TO THE PEACE OF MIND OF OUR FAMILY
THAT I GO OFF BY MYSELF AND PICK UP MY WILD FLOWERS AND GREEN THINGS AND I'M NOT BOTHERING ROUND FOCUSSING EVERY LIVING THING AND POINTING MY LITTLE MACHINE AT EVERY FREAK IN NATURE THAT I SEE ALL RIGHT SAID JASPER GOOD NATUREDLY BUT YOU HAVE THE STRAP ROUND YOUR NECK ALL THE SAME TOM
THROWING HERSELF DOWN ON THE ROCKS THE OTHERS ALL DOING THE SAME THING MISTER KING AND THE PARSON AND MISSUS HENDERSON FOUND THEM AND PRETTY SOON THE GROUP WAS A BIG ONE WELL WELL WE ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER NO WHERE IS MISSUS GRAY
I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT REPLIED THORNDYKE THEN SAID MARCHMONT WE WILL HEAR THE REST OF THE ARGUMENT IF YOU PLEASE VERY WELL SAID THORNDYKE AS THE EVIDENCE STANDS WE HAVE PROVED THAT JEFFREY BLACKMORE
MISTER JEFFREY'S SECOND WILL WAS SIGNED ON THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR AT A TIME THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF CANCER MUST HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISSUS WILSON'S DOCTOR AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO ANY OF HER RELATIVES WHO CHOSE TO INQUIRE AFTER HER
NOT KNOWN TO OR ANTICIPATED BY THE TESTATOR JOHN BLACKMORE MIGHT BECOME THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY CONTRARY TO THE OBVIOUS WISHES OF THE TESTATOR THE NEXT POINT THAT IMPRESSED ME WAS THE MANNER OF MISSUS WILSON'S DEATH
THIS SUGGESTION WAS BORNE OUT BY A FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE ROOMS IN THE KITCHEN THERE WERE PRACTICALLY NO STORES AND HARDLY ANY ARRANGEMENTS EVEN FOR SIMPLE BACHELOR COOKING THE BEDROOM OFFERED THE SAME SUGGESTION
THE EVIDENCE THAT CONVICTS JOHN BLACKMORE WILL CONVICT HER I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ABOUT HER IDENTITY IF JOHN BLACKMORE IS MARRIED
SHE DIED OF CANCER NOW PEOPLE DO NOT DIE SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY OF CANCER THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE STANDS ALMOST ALONE
THAT HE WAS JOHN BLACKMORE THEN WE FIND THAT HE WAS A MAN OF NORMAL EYESIGHT WHO WAS WEARING SPECTACLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISGUISE BUT THE TENANT OF NEW INN
WAS REALLY ACQUAINTED WITH JEFFREY BLACKMORE BOTH BEING STRANGERS WHO HAD ACCEPTED HIS IDENTITY ON HIS OWN STATEMENT
FOR IF THE MAN AT KENNINGTON LANE WAS JEFFREY BLACKMORE THEN THE MAN AT NEW INN WAS NOT BUT IT WAS THE LATTER WHO HAD SIGNED THE WILL THEREFORE THE WILL WAS NOT SIGNED BY JEFFREY BLACKMORE THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS A FORGERY
THAT THEY DIDN'T SLIP AWAY ACROSS THE LINE FROM THE OFF SIDE BUT STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM THEN I WALKED UP THE TRAIN TO THE COMPARTMENT WHICH I HAD SEEN THEM ENTER AND THERE THEY WERE APPARENTLY FAST ASLEEP IN THE CORNER BY THE OFF SIDE WINDOW
THE MAN LEANING BACK WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN AND THE WOMAN RESTING AGAINST HIM WITH HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER SHE GAVE ME QUITE A TURN WHEN I WENT IN TO LOOK AT THEM FOR SHE HAD HER EYES HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING ROUND AT ME WITH A MOST HORRIBLE EXPRESSION
WHO WAS DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN HIS BROTHER'S DEATH BUT IF IT HAD TRANSPIRED THAT JEFFREY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A WOMAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS SUSPICION AND THAT SUSPICION WOULD NOT HAVE POINTED TO JOHN BLACKMORE THUS ALL THE GENERAL PROBABILITIES ARE IN FAVOUR
AND SAW A CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION HANGING ON THE WALL UPSIDE DOWN NOW OF THIS THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT NO ONE WOULD SCREW THE SUSPENSION PLATES ON A FRAME WITHOUT ASCERTAINING WHICH WAS THE RIGHT WAY UP
WE MAY NOTE IN PASSING THAT WEISS AND THE COACHMAN WERE APPARENTLY ONE AND THE SAME PERSON THEY WERE NEVER SEEN TOGETHER WHEN WEISS WAS PRESENT THE COACHMAN WAS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN FOR SO URGENT A SERVICE AS THE OBTAINING OF AN ANTIDOTE TO THE POISON
AND CONSIDER IT BY THE LIGHT OF ANY FRESH FACTS THAT I MIGHT ACQUIRE THE NEW FACTS CAME SOONER THAN I HAD EXPECTED THAT SAME EVENING
THORNDYKE SMILED GENIALLY I THINK HE FORGAVE WINWOOD EVERYTHING FOR THAT REMARK YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SIR HE SAID IT DOES AND FOR THAT REASON THE DEMONSTRATION IS NOT ABSOLUTE BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET
THEN WE TURNED INTO WATERLOO STATION AND AS WE WERE DRIVING UP THE SLOPE WE MET ANOTHER HANSOM COMING DOWN
WE HAVE PROVED THAT THE SICK MAN GRAVES WAS JEFFREY BLACKMORE THAT THE TENANT OF NEW INN WAS JOHN BLACKMORE AND THAT THE MAN WEISS WAS ALSO JOHN BLACKMORE WE NOW HAVE TO PROVE THAT JOHN AND JEFFREY WERE TOGETHER IN THE CHAMBERS AT NEW INN ON THE NIGHT OF JEFFREY'S DEATH
CHAPTER SIXTEEN AN EXPOSITION AND A TRAGEDY
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE INTO ONE OF THE REAR COMPARTMENTS AND BADGER AND I RACED UP THE PLATFORM LIKE MAD
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE PECULIAR GRAVELLY MUD THAT ADHERED TO MY OWN BOOTS AND JERVIS'S AND WHICH CAME FROM THE SQUARE OF THE INN YET THE PORTER DISTINCTLY STATED THAT THE DECEASED AFTER PAYING THE RENT
THEY WERE DEAD I SUPPOSE SAID THORNDYKE YES SIR STONE DEAD
THAT SAID THORNDYKE COMPLETES THE FIRST PART OF MY INVESTIGATION WE HAD NOW REACHED A DEFINITE DEMONSTRABLE FACT AND THAT FACT AS YOU SEE DISPOSED AT ONCE OF THE MAIN QUESTION THE GENUINENESS OF THE WILL
BUT THERE I MUSTN'T RUN DOWN MY BROTHER OFFICERS AND IT'S EASY TO BE WISE AFTER THE EVENT
THE NAME WHICH JERVIS HEARD POOR JEFFREY STRUGGLING TO PRONOUNCE SEEMED TO ME TO RESEMBLE PAULINE MORE THAN ANY OTHER NAME THERE IS ONE LITTLE POINT THAT STRIKES ME SAID MARCHMONT IS IT NOT RATHER REMARKABLE THAT THE PORTER
IS PROVIDED FOR BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MISTER JEFFREY PAID HIS RENT PERSONALLY AND PREMATURELY TO THE PORTER ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MARCH THUS ESTABLISHING BEYOND QUESTION THE FACT THAT HE WAS ALIVE ON THAT DATE AND YET FURTHER
ONE IS THAT THE SPECTACLES FOUND BY US AT KENNINGTON LANE WERE UNDOUBTEDLY JEFFREY'S
AND FORTHWITH BEGAN HIS STORY AS SOON AS WE HAD YOUR INFORMATION WE PROCURED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF BOTH PARTIES AND THEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THEIR FLAT WITH INSPECTOR BADGER AND A SERGEANT
HERE WAS A WILL WHICH ENABLED JOHN BLACKMORE TO INHERIT THE FORTUNE OF A MAN WHO ALMOST CERTAINLY HAD NO INTENTION OF BEQUEATHING IT TO HIM THE WORDING OF THAT WILL SEEMED TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE PECULIARITIES OF MISSUS WILSON'S DISEASE
BUT THE ERRONEOUS REASONING WHICH EVERY ONE WOULD BASE ON THE PORTER'S CONCLUSIONS FOR SINCE THE BODY WAS ACTUALLY JEFFREY'S AND WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE PORTER AS THAT OF HIS TENANT IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED BY EVERY ONE THAT NO QUESTION WAS POSSIBLE
THORNDYKE PAUSED AND MISTER MARCHMONT WHO HAD LISTENED WITH CLOSE ATTENTION NODDED AS HE GLANCED AT HIS SILENT PARTNER
HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED OF HER DEATH AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE A NEW WILL OR CODICIL IN HIS NEPHEW'S FAVOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE CONSPIRED IN THE MOST SINGULAR MANNER IN FAVOUR OF JOHN BLACKMORE
AND PLACE IT ON ONE SIDE THE SCALES AND THE EXCESSIVE PRAISE AND PLACE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY BALANCE AND SO I CONSIDER I HAVE HAD SIMPLE JUSTICE BUT WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE IS A CLASS OF MEN IN TOWNS AND CITIES
ARE NOT FITTINGLY DESCRIBED NAMELY THE NUTRITIVE AUGMENTATIVE AND GENERATIVE FOR THESE ARE CALLED NATURAL FORCES BUT THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE ABOVE THE NATURAL FORCES THEREFORE WE SHOULD NOT CLASS THE ABOVE FORCES AS POWERS OF THE SOUL
THE POWERS ARE THE VEGETATIVE THE SENSITIVE THE APPETITIVE THE LOCOMOTION AND THE INTELLECTUAL I ANSWER THAT THERE ARE FIVE GENERA OF POWERS OF THE SOUL AS ABOVE NUMBERED
ITS EDITORS WOULD IF THEY DARED BLOW UP THE CAPITOL OF THE NATION IF THEY COULD ONLY SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OFF THE FRIEZE OF ONE OF THE CORRIDORS THERE ARE ENOUGH FALSEHOODS TOLD AT ANY ONE OF OUR AUTUMNAL ELECTIONS
THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS INSTITUTION IN FRANCE WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY ONE BY A PHYSICIAN WHO PUBLISHED THE NEWS FOR THE AMUSEMENT AND HEALTH OF HIS PATIENTS THE FRENCH NATION UNDERSTOOD FULLY HOW TO APPRECIATE THIS POWER
AND UNDERGIRD THE SEA SOME ONE SHALL WITH THE FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND CLICK THE INSTRUMENT THAT SHALL THRILL THROUGH ALL LANDS ACROSS ALL ISLANDS UNDER ALL SEAS THROUGH ALL PALACES INTO ALL DUNGEONS
IN SEVERAL WAYS A THING IS SAID TO LIVE AND EVEN IF ONLY ONE OF THESE IS PRESENT THE THING IS SAID TO LIVE AS INTELLECT AND SENSE LOCAL MOVEMENT AND REST AND LASTLY MOVEMENT OF DECREASE AND INCREASE DUE TO NOURISHMENT
IN ONE COLUMN OF A PAPER WE SEE A GRAND ETHICAL DISCUSSION
BUT ONLY THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED NAMELY THE VEGETATIVE SOUL THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE RATIONAL SOUL THEREFORE THERE ARE ONLY THREE GENERA OF POWERS IN THE SOUL AND NOT FIVE
FURTHER WE SHOULD NOT ASSIGN A PARTICULAR POWER OF THE SOUL TO THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO LIVING AND NON LIVING THINGS BUT GENERATION IS COMMON TO ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE GENERATED AND CORRUPTED WHETHER LIVING OR NOT LIVING
NAMELY EVERY SENSIBLE BODY NOT ONLY THE BODY TO WHICH THE SOUL IS UNITED AND THERE IS YET ANOTHER GENUS IN THE POWERS OF THE SOUL WHICH GENUS REGARDS A STILL MORE UNIVERSAL OBJECT NAMELY NOT ONLY THE SENSIBLE BODY
YET SCOOPING UP INTO THEMSELVES THE POLLUTION OF SOCIETY AND IN THE AWFUL RUSH MAKING THE EARTH TREMBLE THE MOST ABANDONED MAN OF THE CITY MAY GO TO THE BAD NEWSPAPER AND GET A SLANDER INSERTED ABOUT THE BEST MAN
FURTHER A SPECIAL KIND OF SOUL OUGHT NOT TO BE ASSIGNED AS REGARDS WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL THE POWERS NOW DESIRE IS COMMON TO EACH POWER OF THE SOUL FOR SIGHT DESIRES AN APPROPRIATE VISIBLE OBJECT WHENCE WE READ
IT WAS PRINTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL INFORMATION TO THE VENETIANS
BUT IN THE UNITED STATES THE NEWSPAPER HAS COME TO UNLIMITED SWAY THOUGH IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THERE WERE BUT THIRTY SEVEN IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THE NUMBER OF PUBLISHED JOURNALS IS NOW COUNTED BY THOUSANDS
THE MODES OF LIVING ARE DISTINGUISHED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREES OF LIVING THINGS THERE ARE SOME LIVING THINGS IN WHICH THERE EXISTS ONLY VEGETATIVE POWER AS THE PLANTS THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH WITH THE VEGETATIVE THERE EXISTS ALSO THE SENSITIVE
BUT BETWEEN THE TRACKS THERE IS A TROUGH ONE FOURTH OF A MILE IN LENGTH FILLED WITH WATER AND THE ENGINE DROPS A HOSE THAT CATCHES UP THE WATER WHILE THE TRAIN FLIES SO WITH BAD NEWSPAPERS THAT FLY ALONG THE TRACK OF DEATH WITHOUT PAUSING A MOMENT
FURTHER THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF ITS VITAL OPERATIONS NOW IN FOUR WAYS IS A THING SAID TO LIVE FOR THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
FURTHER THE SOUL IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BODY BUT THE BODY BY THE SAME FORCE GIVES SPECIES AND QUANTITY MUCH MORE THEREFORE DOES THE SOUL THEREFORE THE AUGMENTATIVE POWER OF THE SOUL IS NOT DISTINCT FROM THE GENERATIVE POWER
THEIR COLUMNS ARE NOT LONG AND BROAD ENOUGH TO RECORD THE TRAGEDIES OF THEIR HORRIBLE UNDOING OF IMMORTAL MEN AND WOMEN
ARE BEING TOSSED AND DRIVEN HITHER AND THITHER ARE TRYING TO CLIMB UP AND PUT OUT THE ONLY LIGHT OF A LOST WORLD THE BAD NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT PUBLISHING THE MOST DAMAGING AND UNCLEAN STORY THE ONLY QUESTION IS WILL IT PAY
MANY OF THESE OFFENSIVE ANONYMOUS LETTERS YOU SEE IN THE BAD NEWSPAPER HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE WRITTEN IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR THE BAD NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT ANY POLITICAL OUTRAGE
AS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES BY THE CLOUDS OF SUMMER INSECTS BLOWN UP FROM THE MARSHES THE IMMORAL NEWSPAPER STOPS NOT AT THE UNCLEAN ADVERTISEMENT
AND SUCH IS THE OPERATION OF THE RATIONAL SOUL BELOW THIS THERE IS ANOTHER OPERATION OF THE SOUL WHICH IS INDEED PERFORMED
NAMELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING BUT THE ANIMAL BY THE APPETITIVE POWER DESIRES THE THING SEEN NOT MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING IT BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT IF THE SOUL DID NOT REQUIRE THINGS PERCEIVED BY THE SENSES
AND IN THIS WAY THERE ARE AGAIN TWO KINDS OF POWERS IN THE SOUL ONE THE APPETITIVE IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE SOUL IS REFERRED TO SOMETHING EXTRINSIC AS TO AN END WHICH IS FIRST IN THE INTENTION THE OTHER THE LOCOMOTIVE POWER
WHO CAN ESTIMATE THE POLITICAL SCIENTIFIC COMMERCIAL AND RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONS ROUSED UP IN ENGLAND FOR MANY YEARS PAST BY BELL'S WEEKLY DISPATCH THE STANDARD THE MORNING CHRONICLE THE POST AND THE LONDON TIMES
FIRST WE SHALL CONSIDER THOSE POWERS WHICH ARE A PREAMBLE TO THE INTELLECT SECONDLY THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS THIRDLY THE APPETITIVE POWERS UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE FOUR POINTS OF INQUIRY
A MAN IS NO BETTER THAN THE NEWSPAPER HE HABITUALLY READS YOU MAY THINK IT A BOLD THING THUS TO ARRAIGN AN UNPRINCIPLED PRINTING PRESS BUT I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE READING THIS WHO WILL TAKE MY COUNSEL AND IN THE DISCHARGE OF MY DUTY TO GOD AND MAN
A POLL WAS DEMANDED AND MY PROPOSITION CARRIED MISTER SAIN GOT IN BY A MAJORITY OF ONE VOTE AND LIEUTENANT FRANKLIN BEING A FRIEND OF MINE
OF A TRAIN OF ARTILLERY AS THE OCCASION OF WAR OFTEN REQUIRES IT IS UNHANDSOME TO QUIT THEIR POST TO AVOID THE DANGER
AND MANY A ONE BY DUCKING STEPPING ASIDE AND SUCH OTHER MOTIONS OF FEAR HAS BEEN AT ALL EVENTS SUFFICIENTLY LAUGHED AT BY HIS COMPANIONS AND YET
VOLVUNTUR INANES THOUGH TEARS FLOW THE MIND REMAINS UNMOVED VIRGIL A ENEID
TO IT SWAYED GENTLY THE PASSIVE MASS OBEYED THE VAGUE MOTIONS OF SPACE IT WAS AN OBJECT TO INSPIRE INDESCRIBABLE DREAD HORROR
STANDING BEFORE HER APPARENTLY POINTING OUT WITH HIS IRON TIPPED STICK THE ROUTE OVER WHICH HE HAD COME HE WAS DIRECTING HER ATTENTION TO A WINDING PATH THAT LED TO THE MOUNTAIN ABOVE THEM WERE THE ALPS
MY UNIFORM HOWEVER WAS FAR MORE BRILLIANT THAN MY MILITARY CAREER WAS DESTINED TO BE
I FELT THAT THIS MUST BE THE EXPLANATION AND THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO ASSURE THEM THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE ONE FROM ALL DANGERS
THE DEEP OBLIVION OF SOLITUDE ENVIRONED IT IT WAS GIVEN UP TO UNKNOWN CHANCES IT WAS WITHOUT DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARKNESS WHICH DID WITH IT WHAT IT WILLED IT WAS FOR EVER THE PATIENT IT SUBMITTED
SING MY DEAR I BEG OF YOU
WHENEVER I ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HER TO SPEAK FRANKLY SHE ASSURED ME THAT THE LETTER WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER MELANCHOLY AND BEGGED ME TO SAY NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT THEN I TRIED IN VAIN TO GUESS
I KNOW OF ONE SAID HE WHERE A MAN LIKE YOU IS WANTED A FELLOW THAT CAN PLEASE EVERYBODY WHAT IS THE SALARY I ASKED YOU HAD BETTER CALL AND MAKE YOUR OWN TERMS HE REPLIED YOU CAN MENTION MY NAME IF YOU LIKE THANKS SAID I BUT WHERE IS IT
IN THE DISTANCE A VILLAGE CONSISTING OF SOME DOZEN HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN THE FOREGROUND A YOUNG GIRL WITH A LARGE STRAW HAT
FLIGHT AND WHEREAS LACHES CONSIDERING BETTER OF IT ADMITS THE PRACTICE AS TO THE SCYTHIANS AND IN GENERAL ALL CAVALRY WHATEVER
WAS THAT EACH MAN WAS TO RECEIVE SIX SHILLINGS PER DAY WHEN CALLED OUT FOR PRACTICE AND EACH COMPANY WAS TO HAVE THE ELECTION OF ITS OWN OFFICERS WHO WERE TO BE CHOSEN BY BALLOT EACH COMPANY WAS ALSO TO APPOINT ITS OWN SHOEMAKER AND TAILOR
AFTER DRILL ON PAY DAYS I WAS TO MARCH THE MEN FOUR ABREAST FROM THE PARADE GROUND TO HIS HOUSE TO BE PAID THE NATURAL RESULT OF SUCH A COURSE WAS THAT THE MEN SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THEIR PAY IN DRINK AS A FRIGHTFUL EXAMPLE OF THIS
I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEN I CLASPED MY HANDS TO PLEAD WITH WHOM
BLENDED WITH ALL THE VAGUE DISTORTIONS OF THE CLOUD AND THE WAVE BOUNDLESS DREAMS OF SHADOW WHO COULD TELL WHAT SINISTER MYSTERIES LURKED BEHIND THIS PHANTOM
ONE CANNOT HELP STOPPING A PREY TO DREAMS INTO THE REALMS OF WHICH THE MIND ENTERS IN THE INVISIBLE THERE ARE DARK PORTALS AJAR NO ONE COULD HAVE MET THIS DEAD MAN WITHOUT MEDITATING
GOING TO RECONNOITRE THE CITY OF ARLES AND ADVANCING OUT OF THE COVER OF A WINDMILL UNDER FAVOUR OF WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS APPROACH WAS PERCEIVED BY THE
SOMETHING WANDERING ABOUT SOMETHING IN CHAINS CAN ONE IMAGINE A MORE MOURNFUL LINEAMENT IN THE DARKNESS REALITIES EXIST HERE BELOW WHICH SERVE AS ISSUES TO THE UNKNOWN
PLATAEA NOT BEING ABLE TO BREAK INTO THE PERSIAN PHALANX BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES TO DISPERSE AND RETIRE THAT BY THE ENEMY SUPPOSING THEY FLED
IT WAS A PREY OF GHASTLY EXAGGERATION TWILIGHT AND MOONRISE STARS SETTING BEHIND THE CLIFF FLOATING THINGS IN SPACE THE CLOUDS WINDS FROM ALL QUARTERS
WHEN SMITH LEFT US IN THE EVENING WE EITHER KEPT SILENCE OR TALKED OF HIM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT FATAL ATTRACTION LED ME TO ASK ABOUT HIM CONTINUALLY
OF THIS PECULIAR FINGER AND THIS PECULIAR THUMB THERE WAS A LINE FROM WHICH HUNG SOMETHING BLACK AND SHAPELESS THE LINE MOVING IN THE WIND SOUNDED LIKE A CHAIN
SO I WENT HOME TO TELL MY WIFE OF MY GOOD LUCK
HE AGAIN ATTACKS HIM WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE
AND DOUBTLESS THEY WILL GO ON IMPROVING AS THE TEMPERANCE FLAG WAVES THROUGH OUR STREETS IN THOSE OLD TIMES HOWEVER I WENT ON PROGRESSING WITH SHOEMAKING SINGING AND SOLDIERING AND UPON THE WHOLE WAS MAKING A FAIR LIVING ABOUT THIS TIME A CHANGE TOOK PLACE
HAD ENDED BY PENETRATING INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THIS VISIBLE NOTHING THE SPECIES OF LOG HANGING IN THE WIND PARTOOK OF THE IMPERSONALITY DIFFUSED FAR OVER SEA AND SKY
SUCH A THING IS BEYOND THE POWER OF LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS TO EXIST NO MORE YET TO PERSIST TO BE IN THE ABYSS YET OUT OF IT TO REAPPEAR ABOVE DEATH AS IF INDISSOLUBLE
THAT HE SHOULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF ADDING TO HER SORROW
AS TO SEEK TO AVOID IT FOR MY OWN PART I CONFESS I CANNOT FORBEAR STARTING WHEN THE
HE NOTICED A CERTAIN COLDNESS AND RESTRAINT WHICH HE ENDEAVORED TO BANISH BY CHEERFUL GOOD HUMOR
MISERABLE SPECIMEN AT FIRST SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER IT WERE BOY OR GIRL WHIMPERING AND MOPPING ITS NOSE WITH A VERY DIRTY HAND
CHIEFLY BECAUSE NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER HAD THE PLUCK TO TACKLE THE MATTER THEY WERE ASHAMED TO HAVE THEIR DAUGHTER KNOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN EVEN A SMALL DECEPTION IT SEEMED SO LIKE INTRUDING INTO HER INTIMATE LIFE THERE ARE PARENTS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
WORTH WHILE AND ANSWERED THE QUESTION ONCE MORE WITH NEITHER TO ME NOR TO THEM SHE HAD ALREADY LEARNED THOUGH TOO YOUNG FOR THE LESSON THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL WORKS OUT HIS OWN SALVATION
SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THE MISERY SHE HAD SEEN SO IT HAD BEEN A LITTLE IN A DESIRE TO GIVE ONE MORE SOP TO HER CONSCIENCE THAT SHE HAD DEDICATED HER LAST AFTERNOON TO FREEDOM
IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF A TRUTH WHICH NO ONE THINKS OF DENYING THAT THE SPIRIT HAS ITS SECRETS IMAGINATION PLAYS A GREAT PART IN MOST OF OUR LIVES
THERE HE ALIGHTED AND THE COACH TOOK COSETTE BACK TO THE RUE DE BABYLONE IT WAS USUALLY WHEN MONEY WAS LACKING IN THE HOUSE THAT JEAN VALJEAN TOOK THESE LITTLE TRIPS SO JEAN VALJEAN WAS ABSENT HE HAD SAID
AND DREARILY STARTED UP THE HILL SHE DID NOT GO FAR HOWEVER MISS MORELAND HAD HER MISGIVINGS ON THAT POINT AND JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DRAW A BREATH OF RELIEF CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL SHE WOULD GO THE GIRL STOPPED
SOMETHING LIMPID BRILLIANT
I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE ADOLESCENT FINDS IT MUCH EASIER TO CONFIDE IN SOME ONE OTHER THAN THE PARENTS WHO WOULD SEEM TO BE HER PROPER CONFIDANTS AT ANY RATE THE BANKER AND HIS WIFE WERE SIMPLY STAGGERED
SO SUCH AND SUCH A MAN OF THE WORLD SATISFIED AND OPULENT WHO HAS POLISHED BOOTS AND VARNISHED WORDS IF LOOKED AT NOT OUTSIDE BUT INSIDE A THING WHICH IS RESERVED FOR HIS WIFE
PASSED BY SEE HERE THEY SAID TO HIM
ALL RIGHT LAUGHED THE DOCTOR THEN WE HAD ALL BETTER GO INSIDE THE SANITARIUM WALLS AT ONCE DO YOU PRESUME SAID THE JOURNALIST TO PRETEND THAT THIS IS A NORMAL INCIDENT
WE TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS OF OURSELVES WHEN WE WERE BOYS AND GIRLS TOGETHER OF OLD PAPANTI AND OUR FIRST COTILLION OF CLASS DAYS AND I REMEMBERED AFTERWARD
SHE HAD STILL TO CROSS A SMALL LAWN TO REGAIN THE STEPS THE MOON WHICH HAD JUST RISEN BEHIND HER CAST COSETTE'S SHADOW IN FRONT OF HER UPON THIS LAWN AS SHE CAME OUT FROM THE SHRUBBERY COSETTE HALTED IN ALARM
OBVIOUSLY THE THING TO DO WAS TO DELIVER THE CHILD UP TO THE POLICE IT WOULD BE AT ONCE PROPERLY CARED FOR AND THE MOTHER ALSO BUT MISS MORELAND KNEW TOO MUCH OF OFFICIAL CHARITY TO BE GUILTY OF THAT THE EASIEST THING
THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS AT FIRST CONSOLING AND THEN AMAZING
JEAN VALJEAN BECAME QUITE TRANQUIL ONCE MORE AS FOR COSETTE SHE DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHIMNEY POT WAS REALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHADOW WHICH SHE HAD SEEN OR THOUGHT SHE HAD SEEN AND WHETHER THE MOON HAD BEEN IN THE SAME SPOT IN THE SKY
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING THE TALE OF A BRIDE ELECT THE NEXT DAY WE ALL HUNG ABOUT THE GARDEN EXCEPT THE YOUNGSTER WHO DISAPPEARED ON HIS WHEEL EARLY IN THE DAY AND ONLY CAME BACK
IT IS THE GLORY THAT GILDS OUR FACTS IT IS THE BRILLIANT BARRIER WHICH SEPARATES US FROM THE BEASTS AND THE ONLY REAL THING THAT DIVIDES US INTO CLASSES THOUGH OF COURSE
AND THAT HE WAS WALKING VERY SOFTLY SHE MOUNTED RAPIDLY TO THE FIRST FLOOR TO HER OWN CHAMBER OPENED A SMALL WICKET IN HER SHUTTER AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN THE MOON WAS AT THE FULL EVERYTHING COULD BE SEEN AS PLAINLY AS BY DAY
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE SHE OPENED THE WINDOW THE GARDEN WAS ABSOLUTELY CALM AND ALL THAT WAS VISIBLE WAS THAT THE STREET WAS DESERTED AS USUAL COSETTE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
WHICH OCCUPIED HER SHE FANCIED THAT SHE CAUGHT FOR AN INSTANT A SOUND SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PRECEDING EVENING AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING BENEATH THE TREES IN THE DUSK AND NOT VERY FAR FROM HER
BUT SHE HAD FELT IT ABSURD ALWAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF WORK IN A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AND TO DAY SHE COULD NOT AS SHE USUALLY DID TAKE A STREET CAR FOR FEAR OF MEETING FRIENDS THEY THOUGHT HER QUEER ENOUGH AS IT WAS
THE DOCTOR'S STORY AS ONE DREAMS THE TALE OF AN ADOLESCENT THE NEXT DAY WAS VERY PEACEFUL WE WERE BECOMING HABITUATED TO THE SITUATION IT WAS A SUNDAY AND THE WEATHER WAS WARM
MISS MORELAND WAS SO CONSCIOUSLY IRRITATED WITH LIFE THAT SHE WAS UNUSUALLY GENTLE SHE STOOPED DOWN THE CHILD DID NOT SEEM SIX YEARS OLD THE FACE WAS NOT SO VERY CUNNING IT WAS NOT UGLY EITHER
SO TEN YEARS AFTER THE SCHOOL ADVENTURE IT HAPPENED ONE BEAUTIFUL DAY IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THAT THE TEACHER WAS A GUEST AT THE NORTH SHORE SUMMER HOME OF THE PRINCIPAL GIRL NOW THE MOTHER OF TWO HANDSOME BOYS THAT AFTERNOON AT TEA SITTING ON THE VERANDAH
UNTIL HE CAME SPICK AND SPAN IN WHITE FLANNELS
IT WAS IN THE DAYS BEFORE BOSTON HAD MUCH OF AN IMMIGRANT QUARTER WHEN SOME SMART FAMILIES STILL LIVED IN THE OLD COLONIAL HOUSES AT THE NORTH END AND MINISTERS AND LAWYERS AND ALL PROFESSIONAL MEN SENT THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT THAT TIME PROBABLY
A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF COSETTE SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT THE POWER TO SPEAK OR CRY OR CALL OR STIR OR TURN HER HEAD THEN SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER COURAGE AND TURNED ROUND RESOLUTELY
BESIDES IT WAS NOT YET SO VERY LATE BIDDING THE CHILD HURRY SHE FOLLOWED HER UP THE HILL AND DOWN THE OTHER SIDE TO A PART OF THE CITY WITH WHICH SHE WAS NOT FAMILIAR THE CHILD CRIED QUIETLY ALL THE WAY MISS MORELAND WAS TOO VAGUELY UNCOMFORTABLE TO TALK TO HER
THAT HE MUST GAIN TIME THERE WAS DANGER IN LAURA'S TONE THERE WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN HER CALMNESS HER STEADY EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR HIM YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE SHE SAID
IN THE DRESS OF THEIR MAIDENS IN THEIR SONGS THE MOUNTAIN THAT COLOSSAL RUIN IS ALL AGLOW IN BISCAY
ANY ONE APPROACHING THE VESSEL'S MOORINGS WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A BISCAYAN HOOKER THE SUN CONCEALED ALL DAY BY THE MIST HAD JUST SET
THESE BISCAY HOOKERS EVEN TO THE POOREST WERE GILT AND PAINTED TATTOOING IS PART OF THE GENIUS OF THOSE CHARMING PEOPLE SAVAGES TO SOME DEGREE THE SUBLIME COLOURING OF THEIR MOUNTAINS
PRESENTS THE APPEARANCE OF A BIRD'S HEAD OF WHICH THE BILL IS TURNED TOWARDS THE OCEAN THE BACK OF THE HEAD TOWARDS WEYMOUTH THE ISTHMUS IS ITS NECK PORTLAND
A GIRL WHO LETS HER STAY LACE HANG DOWN TRAILING OVER THE BACK OF AN ARMCHAIR DESCRIBES WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT MOST OF THE PATHS OF CLIFFS AND MOUNTAINS THE PATHWAY OF THIS CREEK
AND ALL THE MONTH OF JANUARY SIXTEEN NINETY
THE BEINGS WHO WERE GOING TO SAIL AWAY IN THE BISCAYAN URCA PRESSED ON THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE ALL THE SAME THEY FORMED A BUSY AND CONFUSED GROUP IN RAPID MOVEMENT ON THE SHORE
AND THE SPINOUS SHARK AS WELL AS THE NETS TO PICK UP THE SUNFISH EXCEPT A FEW OTHER CRAFT ALL SWEPT INTO THE SAME CORNER THE EYE MET NOTHING LIVING ON THE VAST HORIZON OF PORTLAND
WAS NOT HER LOVE FOR GEORGE SELBY DEEPER THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN'S COULD BE HAD SHE NOT A RIGHT TO HIM DID HE NOT BELONG TO HER BY VIRTUE OF HER OVERMASTERING PASSION HIS WIFE
THE COLONEL VOWED AND PROTESTED HE KISSED HER HAND AND HER LIPS HE SWORE HIS FALSE SOUL INTO PERDITION SHE WANTED LOVE THIS WOMAN
ON LITTLE BOLTS AS IN CARDAN'S LAMPS THERE WAS SCIENCE AND CUNNING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOOKER BUT IT WAS IGNORANT SCIENCE AND BARBAROUS CUNNING THE HOOKER WAS PRIMITIVE JUST LIKE THE PRAAM AND THE CANOE
AS HOT ANGER AGAIN COURSED THROUGH HER VEINS AND SAID AND YOU DARE COME WITH HER HERE AND TELL ME OF IT HERE AND MOCK ME WITH IT AND YOU THINK I WILL HAVE IT GEORGE YOU THINK I WILL LET YOU LIVE WITH THAT WOMAN
TO DAY AS A QUARRY THE PICK BITES MEANLY THE WAVE GRANDLY HENCE A DIMINUTION OF BEAUTY TO THE MAGNIFICENT RAVAGES OF THE OCEAN
THEIR THRESHOLDS AND THEIR WINDOWS TEEM WITH FACES FAIR AND FRESH LAUGHING UNDER GARLANDS OF MAIZE A JOYOUS AND PROUD SERENITY SHINES OUT IN THEIR INGENIOUS ARTS IN THEIR TRADES IN THEIR CUSTOMS
WHERE WAS HIS COOLNESS WHERE WAS HIS SNEERING IMPERTURBABLE MANNER
CARVED AND HUNG WITH RIBBONS A COBBLER HAS A BAS RELIEF ON HIS DOOR IT IS ONLY SAINT CRISPIN AND AN OLD SHOE BUT IT IS IN STONE THEY TRIM THEIR LEATHERN JACKETS WITH LACE
PLACED THE VESSEL IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE LAND DARK FIGURES WERE CROSSING AND RECROSSING EACH OTHER ON THIS TOTTERING GANGWAY AND IN THE SHADOW SOME PEOPLE WERE EMBARKING
TO DISTINGUISH ONE FROM ANOTHER WAS DIFFICULT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHETHER THEY WERE OLD OR YOUNG THE INDISTINCTNESS OF EVENING INTERMIXED AND BLURRED THEM
IT WAS A HANDSOME MANSION ON THE SQUARE OPPOSITE THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE THE OWNER MUST BE A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH THE COLONEL THOUGHT PERHAPS WHO KNOWS SAID HE WITH A SMILE
THERE WERE MANY OTHERS IN WASHINGTON ON THE SAME ERRAND SOME OF THEM WITH CLAIMS AS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AS HIS A CONCERT OF ACTION WAS NECESSARY
HE BELONGED TO HER HAD HE NOT CONFESSED IT HIMSELF NOT EVEN THE RELIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE OF SENATOR DILWORTHY'S HOUSE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO INSTILL INTO LAURA THAT DEEP CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE
IT WAS LESS COLD IN THE CREEK THAN OUT AT SEA THANKS TO THE SCREEN OF ROCK RISING OVER THE NORTH OF THE BASIN WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER PREVENT THE PEOPLE FROM SHIVERING THEY WERE HURRYING
LAURA THOUGHT THIS BELIEVED IT BECAUSE SHE DESIRED TO BELIEVE IT
WE ARE WRONG IN SAYING THE NIGHT FALLS WE SHOULD SAY THE NIGHT RISES FOR IT IS FROM THE EARTH THAT OBSCURITY COMES IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF IT WAS STILL DAY AT TOP
BUT THEY'D HAVE TO TIE HIM ON LAURA WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE HEARD THE BELL SHE HEARD THE STEPS IN THE HALL AND THE EMPHATIC THUD OF THE SUPPORTING CANE
TOWARDS THE POINT BEYOND FOLLY PIER AND DIRDLE PIER BEYOND WAKEHAM EVEN BETWEEN THE PLACE CALLED CHURCH HOPE AND THE PLACE CALLED SOUTHWELL THE CREEK
THERE WAS BEGINNING TO BE FELT THAT DEEP AND SOMBROUS MELANCHOLY WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED
THAT THEY MUST TALK OVER AND SO ON DID THIS SEEM LIKE A DAMNABLE PLOT TO LAURA AGAINST THE LIFE MAYBE OF A SISTER A WOMAN LIKE HERSELF PROBABLY NOT
A SIGN OF BAD WEATHER EXPECTED AND DANGER OUT AT SEA THEY WERE ENGAGED IN CASTING ANCHOR THE CHIEF BOAT PLACED IN FRONT AFTER THE OLD MANNER OF NORWEGIAN FLOTILLAS
AND THE THING EDRED COULDN'T DO WAS TO MAKE POETRY HOWEVER BAD HE SIMPLY COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN FLY IT WASN'T IN HIM ANY MORE THAN WINGS ARE ON YOU OH MOULDIWARP YOU SAID WE MUST
I'M GOING TO TRY ANYWAY SAID EDRED AT LEAST YOU MUST TOO BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE POETRY
BEALE GROWLED BLUNDERED DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT THROUGH THE WASH HOUSE AND CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WITH A STABLE LANTERN IN HIS HAND HE CAME CLOSE TO WHERE LORD ARDEN STOOD A TALL DARK FIGURE IN THE STARLIGHT AND SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED THE LITTLE NIPPER
PERHAPS DICKIE WAS LYING BOUND HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FURZE BUSH DICKIE HE SAID SOFTLY DICKIE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED ONLY TRUE SNEEZED AND SNUFFED AND BLEW AND WENT ON DIGGING
I WANT TO THINK THIS UNUSUAL DESIRE QUITE AWED ELFRIDA BUT IT IRRITATED HER TOO PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE ME TO GO AWAY SHE SAID IRONICALLY AND EDRED'S WHOLLY UNEXPECTED REPLY WAS YES PLEASE
WELL I'VE OFTEN MADE ONE OF MYSELF SAID ELFRIDA COMFORTINGLY AND I WILL AGAIN IF YOU LIKE BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'LL BE ANY MORE GOOD THAN YOURS
VERY WELL THEN SHE SAID HEROICALLY I WON'T ASK YOU A SINGLE THING BUT YOU'LL TELL ME THE MINUTE YOU CAN WON'T YOU AND YOU'LL LET ME HELP NOBODY CAN HELP NO ONE CAN ADVISE ME EDRED SAID
HE FANCIED HE HEARD A SOFT FOOTSTEP PAD PADDING BEHIND HIM BUT OF COURSE WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND HE COULD SEE NO ONE WAS THERE
I'VE GOT TO DO IT OFF MY OWN BAT IF I DO IT AT ALL
JUST EXACTLY AS IF SOME ONE WAS CROUCHING IN THE SHADOW HE PRESSED HIS THUMB ON THE LATCH AND OPENED THE DOOR VERY SOFTLY SOMETHING MOVED INSIDE AND A CHAIN RATTLED
BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE THE DUEL HE WROTE A LETTER SAYING WHAT HE HAD DONE AND PUT IT IN A SECRET CUPBOARD BEHIND A PICTURE OF A LADY WHO WAS BORN AN ARDEN AT TALBOT COURT AND THERE THAT LETTER IS TO THIS DAY I HOPE I SHAN'T FORGET IT ALL
AN WORSE E DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LIKE WHEN I MET IM WHY I SET OUT TO MAKE A BLIGHTED BURGLAR OF IM YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE AND OUT THE WHOLE STORY CAME AS LORD ARDEN AND HE WENT ALONG THE GRAY ROAD
WE COULD DRESS UP ANYWAY SAID EDRED HOPEFULLY
SUDDENLY TRUE PAUSED SNIFFED SNEEZED BLEW THROUGH HIS NOSE AND BEGAN TO DIG COME ON COME ON GOOD DOG SAID EDRED COME ON TRUE FOR HIS FANCY PICTURED DICKIE A PRISONER IN SOME LONELY COTTAGE
NO OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T WELL WHAT AM I TO DO WHEN DICKIE'S FATHER DIED A DEPTFORD WOMAN RELATED TO DICKIE'S MOTHER KEPT THE CHILD SHE WAS NOT KIND TO HIM AND HE LEFT HER LATER SHE MET A MAN WHO HAD BEEN A BURGLAR
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
IT IS IMPERTINENT OF BEALE AND THOUGHTLESS OF THE BOY
TO DO RIGHT OFTEN SEEMS UNKIND TO ONE OR ANOTHER SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP BUT THINK HOW LONG WOULD YOUR FATHER WISH TO KEEP HIS HOUSE AND HIS CASTLE IF HE KNEW THAT THEY BELONGED TO SOME ONE ELSE I SEE SAID EDRED STILL DOUBTFULLY
BUT ALREADY THEY HAVE FOUND OUT THAT A LETTER SIGNED BY A CHILD IS USELESS AND UNLAWFUL AND THEY DARE NOT LET RICHARD GO FOR FEAR OF PUNISHMENT SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING YOUR FATHER IS SAFE AND YOU WILL INHERIT ARDEN
AN ENORMOUS CAVERN AS BIG AS A CHURCH OUT OF AN OPENING AT THE UPPER END A STREAM OF WATER FELL AND RAN ALONG THE CAVE CLEAR BETWEEN SHORES OF SMOOTH SAND
GOT UP AND DRESSED HE PUT HIS BEDROOM CANDLE AND MATCHES IN HIS POCKET CREPT DOWN STAIRS AND OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO BEALE'S IT WAS A SLOW AND NERVOUS BUSINESS MORE THAN ONCE ON THE STAIRCASE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A STAIR CREAK BEHIND HIM
AND I KNOW THAT'S NO USE I SHOULD THINK NOT
I CANNOT PLAY ALONE THE SUMMER COMES WITH FLOWER AND BEE
I WISH EVERY ONE WAS SIGHED EDRED AND I DARE SAY YOU HAVE OFTEN FELT THE SAME WELL FIRE AWAY NOT THAT IT'S ANY GOOD DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY GET AT THE MOULDIESTWARP BY A NOBLE DEED
NO LITTLE GIRL WAS EVER MORE POLITE THAN ELFRIDA OR LESS ANXIOUS TO HURT THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS BUT SHE WAS ALSO QUITE TRUTHFUL
NOT HAVE ANY MORE MAGIC BUT WE TRUST YOU WON'T BE HARD ON US BECAUSE DICKIE IS LOST AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM
BUT I'M SURE IF THE MOULDIESTWARP HEARS IT HE WON'T CARE TUPPENCE WHETHER IT'S SWEAR OR SWORE HE IS MUCH TOO GREAT HE'S FAR ABOVE GRAMMAR I'M SURE
AT ANY RATE HE COULD NEVER BE SURE AFTERWARDS WHETHER THERE REALLY HAD BEEN A VERY POLITE AND PLAUSIBLE BLACK MOLE SITTING ON HIS PILLOW MOST OF THE DAY SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PART OF HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED LEAST AGREED WITH SUCH THINGS AS
HE PULLED IT OUT AND LIGHTED IT AND BLINKED PERCEIVING ALMOST AT ONCE THAT HE WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE HE LOOKED UP HE COULD SEE ABOVE HIM THE STARS PLAIN THROUGH A NET OF FURZE BUSHES HE STOOD UP AND TRUE WENT ON NEXT MOMENT HE KNEW
SAID LORD ARDEN RICHARD IS ASLEEP I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE SO MY LORD SAID BEALE SLEEPY AND PUZZLED YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SOME ANXIETY I HAD TO COME UP TO MAKE SURE HE WAS HERE BUT E AIN'T ERE SAID BEALE
SAID EDRED SUBMISSIVELY YOU WILL NEVER TELL YOUR FATHER THIS THE LOW BEAUTIFUL VOICE WENT ON YOU MUST NOT EVEN TELL YOUR SISTER TILL YOU HAVE RESCUED DICKIE AND MADE THE SACRIFICE
MELTED TO A SPEECHLESS EXTENT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING SAID EDRED AGAIN DON'T SNIVEL LIKE THAT FOR GOODNESS SAKE ELFRIDA THIS IS A MAN'S JOB
THAT WAS HARD WASN'T IT I CAN'T HELP IT I TELL YOU OH ELFRIDA IF YOU'RE GOING TO BOTHER IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH THAT'S ALL YOU REALLY MUSTN'T TELL ME I'VE TOLD YOU SO FIFTY TIMES HE SAID WHICH WAS UNTRUE
I WANT TO REDEEM IN YOUR EYES SOME SMALL MEASURE OF MY UNWORTHINESS AND SO IT IS THAT MY PRIDE DESIRES THAT YOU SHALL KNOW MY THINKING IS CORRECT AND RIGHT MY VIEWS ARE HARSH
NIGHTMARE I HAD NOT CLOSED MY EYES THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND WHAT OF THAT AND OF MY EXHAUSTION I SLEPT SOUNDLY WHEN I FIRST AWOKE IT WAS NIGHT
AND SEEING ME AFTER THAT CAME A KINDLY BLANK I KNEW NOTHING SAW NOTHING MERELY TOTTERED ON IN MY QUEST FOR SAFETY MY NEXT NIGHTMARE VISION WAS A QUIET STREET OF THE DEAD
TO NIGHT HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE I P H AND HE WILL EMBODY HIS MESSAGE IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THERE IS NO CLEW TO THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR WHICH THESE INITIALS STAND
FESTERING IN MISERY AND DEGRADATION ALL THEIR OLD LIBERTIES WERE GONE THEY WERE LABOR SLAVES CHOICE OF WORK WAS DENIED THEM LIKEWISE WAS DENIED THEM THE RIGHT TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE OR THE RIGHT TO BEAR OR POSSESS ARMS
IT IS AN ATTACK UPON ALL CHURCHES UPON THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF ALL CHURCHES THAT HAVE WANDERED FROM THE MASTER'S PATH AND HEDGED THEMSELVES IN FROM HIS LAMBS HERE IT IS THE SILVER TRUMPETS RANG ACROSS THE DOME
IT WAS NOT UNTIL JANUARY NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THAT WE LEFT THE REFUGE ALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED
FLED FROM THE PLATFORM AND THE HALL BUT BISHOP MOREHOUSE OBLIVIOUS TO ALL HIS EYES FILLED WITH HIS VISION CONTINUED
AMONG THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE MANY SURGEONS AND IN VIVISECTION THEY ATTAINED MARVELLOUS PROFICIENCY IN AVIS EVERHARD'S WORDS THEY COULD LITERALLY MAKE A MAN OVER
THE SHOT MISSED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS SCREAMING AND MOTIONING THE SIGNALS MY MEMORY OF RIDING IN THE AUTOMOBILE IS VERY HAZY THOUGH THIS RIDE IN TURN IS BROKEN BY ONE VIVID PICTURE THE CRACK OF THE RIFLE OF THE SOLDIER SITTING BESIDE ME MADE ME OPEN MY EYES
UNTIL IT BECAME BONE OF THEM AND FLESH OF THEM THEY LOOKED UPON THEMSELVES AS WILD ANIMAL TRAINERS RULERS OF BEASTS FROM BENEATH THEIR FEET ROSE ALWAYS THE SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLES OF REVOLT VIOLENT DEATH EVER STALKED IN THEIR MIDST
ALL TWISTED AND DISTORTED BY THE TOIL OF ALL HIS DAYS WITH ON THE PALMS A HORNY GROWTH OF CALLOUS A HALF INCH THICK AND AS I PICKED MYSELF UP AND STARTED ON I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF THE THING AND SAW THAT IT STILL LIVED FOR THE EYES DIMLY INTELLIGENT WERE LOOKING AT ME
AND HIS CHRISTIAN AUDIENCE THAT LOVED HIM CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS CRAZY DID YOU SEE THEM LEADING HIM SO SOLICITOUSLY FROM THE PLATFORM THERE MUST HAVE BEEN LAUGHTER IN HELL AT THE SPECTACLE NEVERTHELESS IT WILL MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION WHAT THE BISHOP DID AND SAID TO NIGHT I SAID
THIS CONVENTION HAD BEEN CALLED TO CONSIDER PUBLIC IMMORALITY AND THE REMEDY FOR IT BISHOP MOREHOUSE PRESIDED HE WAS VERY NERVOUS AS HE SAT ON THE PLATFORM AND I COULD SEE THE HIGH TENSION HE WAS UNDER BY HIS SIDE WERE BISHOP DICKINSON
THE THIRD DAY WE SPENT IN THE BUILDING AND ON THE FOURTH ERNEST HAVING GOT PERMISSION AND AN AUTOMOBILE FROM THE AUTHORITIES WE LEFT CHICAGO MY HEADACHE WAS GONE BUT BODY AND SOUL I WAS VERY TIRED I LAY BACK AGAINST ERNEST IN THE AUTOMOBILE
ERNEST AND I WELL UNDERSTOOD BEFORE WE LEFT THE REFUGE HOW THE STRENGTH OF THE IRON HEEL WAS DEVELOPING THE LABOR CASTES THE MERCENARIES AND THE GREAT HORDES OF SECRET AGENTS AND POLICE OF VARIOUS SORTS WERE ALL PLEDGED TO THE OLIGARCHY
DOWN THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET TOTTERED A WRETCHED SLAVE ONE HAND HE HELD TIGHTLY AGAINST HIS SIDE AND BEHIND HIM HE LEFT A BLOODY TRAIL HIS EYES ROVED EVERYWHERE AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH APPREHENSION AND DREAD ONCE HE LOOKED STRAIGHT ACROSS AT ME
I SAW THEM NOT A WORD THAT HE UTTERED WILL SEE PRINT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE EDITORS THEY DRAW THEIR SALARIES FOR THE POLICY THEY MAINTAIN THEIR POLICY IS TO PRINT NOTHING THAT IS A VITAL MENACE TO THE ESTABLISHED
THEY WERE I MAY SAY APPRENTICED TO EDUCATION TO ART TO THE CHURCH TO SCIENCE TO LITERATURE
LEVIES WERE MADE ON THE LABOR GHETTOS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SERFS WILLY NILLY WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE SCENE OF OPERATIONS GREAT ARMIES OF THEM ARE TOILING NOW AT THE BUILDING OF ARDIS HOUSED IN WRETCHED BARRACKS WHERE FAMILY LIFE CANNOT EXIST
AND WHERE DECENCY IS DISPLACED BY DULL BESTIALITY IN ALL TRUTH THERE IN THE LABOR GHETTOS IS THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST THE OLIGARCHS FEAR SO DREADFULLY BUT IT IS THE BEAST OF THEIR OWN MAKING IN IT
JUST WAIT AND SEE WAS THE ANSWER NOT A LINE NOT A THOUGHT THAT HE UTTERED THE DAILY PRESS THE DAILY SUPPRESSAGE
SUPPOSE I SHOULD DISAGREE WITH EVERYBODY ABOUT THE LITERARY STYLE OF A BOOK THEY WOULDN'T SEND ME TO AN ASYLUM FOR THAT VERY TRUE HE REPLIED BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF OPINION WOULD CONSTITUTE NO MENACE TO SOCIETY THEREIN LIES THE DIFFERENCE
SHE WAS ARRESTED AND ARRAIGNED FOR INSANITY TO DAY SHE WAS EXAMINED BY THE REGULAR INSANITY EXPERTS SHE WAS FOUND INSANE SHE WAS CONSIGNED TO THE NAPA ASYLUM
ALSO A BOMB BURST NEAR ME ONCE IN SOME STILL STREET WHERE LOOK AS I WOULD UP AND DOWN I COULD SEE NO HUMAN BEING BUT MY NEXT SHARP RECOLLECTION BEGINS WITH THE CRACK OF A RIFLE
MAY I BRING YOU TO HEAR HIM OF COURSE HE IS FOREDOOMED TO FUTILITY IT WILL BREAK YOUR HEART IT WILL BREAK HIS BUT FOR YOU IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT OBJECT LESSON
THE BISHOP'S UTTERANCE WAS A VIOLENT ASSAULT UPON THE ESTABLISHED MORALITY IT WAS HERESY THEY LED HIM FROM THE PLATFORM TO PREVENT HIM FROM UTTERING MORE HERESY THE NEWSPAPERS WILL PURGE HIS HERESY IN THE OBLIVION OF SILENCE THE PRESS OF THE UNITED STATES
OUT OF THE FLUX OF TRANSITION THE NEW INSTITUTIONS WERE FORMING MORE DEFINITELY AND TAKING ON THE APPEARANCE AND ATTRIBUTES OF PERMANENCE THE OLIGARCHS HAD SUCCEEDED IN DEVISING A GOVERNMENTAL MACHINE AS INTRICATE AS IT WAS VAST THAT WORKED
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE COLONIAL FORCES THE MERCENARIES CONSTITUTED A RACE APART THEY DWELT IN CITIES OF THEIR OWN WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY SELF GOVERNED AND THEY WERE GRANTED MANY PRIVILEGES BY THEM A LARGE PORTION OF THE PERPLEXING SURPLUS WAS CONSUMED
SOME HAD ROLLED OVERBOARD WHEN THE TIDAL WAVE CAME AND WE NEVER SAW SO MUCH AS THEIR BODIES THE COOK WAS BURNED TO DEATH IN HIS GALLEY HE HAD BEEN PARING POTATOES FOR DINNER AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS RIGHT HAND HELD THE SHANK OF HIS POTATO KNIFE
THE DOORS WERE FRAMED OF GOLD
FOR AN INSTANT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE WATER AND THE FLAME THAT TIDAL WAVE PICKED THE SHIP UP LIKE A CANOE AND THEN SMASHED HER AFTER ONE LIST TO STARBOARD THE SHIP RIGHTED BUT THE MASTS THE BRIDGE THE FUNNEL AND ALL THE UPPER WORKS HAD GONE OVERBOARD
IN THIS PLACE ALSO SAYS DE LEON THERE ARE STONES SO LARGE AND SO OVERGROWN THAT OUR WONDER IS EXCITED IT BEING INCOMPREHENSIBLE HOW THE POWER OF MAN COULD HAVE PLACED THEM WHERE WE SEE THEM
TOWARD THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF FRIDAY WE WERE PRACTICALLY CLEAR OF THE SAND BUT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT WE RAN INTO A SECOND BANK OF IT THOUGH NOT AS BAD AS THE FIRST WE MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS AND FOUND THE STUFF WAS SUPERIOR TO EMERY DUST
AS I STOOD STILL MONT PELEE SEEMED TO SHUDDER AND A MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM ITS CRATER IT WAS QUITE DARK THE SUN BEING OBSCURED BY ASHES AND FINE VOLCANIC DUST THE AIR WAS DEAD ABOUT ME
SO WE GATHERED IT UP THAT NIGHT THERE WERE MORE OF THE SAME ELECTRIC PHENOMENA TOWARD MARTINIQUE
NONE OF US WAS HURT AND THE OLD NORDBY HERSELF PULLED THROUGH ALL RIGHT BUT I'D SOONER STAY ASHORE THAN SEE WAVES WITHOUT WIND AND LIGHTNING WITHOUT THUNDER FIERY STREAM CONTAINED POISONOUS GASES
IT REMINDS US OF MENES MINOS ET CETERA WHO ARE FOUND AT THE BEGINNING OF SO MANY OF THE OLD WORLD TRADITIONS
SO I SUPPOSED AT FIRST WHEN THE FIRE STRUCK US THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BUNK AND SAFE BUT HE WASN'T NOBODY COULD TELL ME WHERE HE WAS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURNED TO DEATH OR ROLLED OVERBOARD AND DROWNED
WE ALL REMARKED IN THE ENGINE ROOM THAT THERE MUST BE A HEAVY STORM APPROACHING SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS EXPERIENCED DEEP WATER SEAMEN
THE DUMB ANIMALS WERE WISER THAN MAN AND EARLY TOOK WARNING OF THE STORM OF FIRE WHICH MONT PELEE WAS STORING UP TO HURL UPON THE ISLAND EVEN BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN BEGAN TO RUMBLE LATE IN APRIL LIVE STOCK BECAME UNEASY AND AT TIMES WERE ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE
WE HAVE HERE A TRADITION OF CASTES LIKE THAT PRESERVED IN THE FOUR TRIBAL NAMES OF ATHENS THE LABORING CLASS NATURALLY ENOUGH IN A NEW COLONY OBTAINED THE SUPREMACY
CAREFUL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE FIERY STREAM WHICH SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED SAINT PIERRE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OF POISONOUS GASES
THE SUCHET CAME ALONG AND TOOK US ALL OFF WE THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE JUST AFTER WE WERE WRECKED THAT WE WERE TO GET HELP FROM A SHIP THAT PASSED US WE BURNED BLUE LIGHTS BUT SHE KEPT ON WE LEARNED AFTERWARD THAT SHE WAS THE RODDAM
THIS INDICATING A LIFT AND FALL OF THE OCEAN BED OFF THE ISLE
EXTENDING FROM ONE DEGREE NORTH OF QUITO TO CUZCO AND FROM CUZCO TO CHILI IT WAS QUITE AS LONG AS THE TWO PACIFIC RAILROADS AND ITS WILD ROUTE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WAS FAR MORE DIFFICULT SARMIENTO DESCRIBING IT SAID
SO DEAD THAT THE FLOATING DUST SEEMINGLY WAS NOT DISTURBED THEN THERE WAS A RENDING CRASHING GRINDING NOISE WHICH I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS SOUNDING AS THOUGH EVERY BIT OF MACHINERY IN THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN DOWN
I FELT MYSELF DRAWN INTO A VORTEX AND I HAD TO BRACE MYSELF FIRMLY IT WAS LIKE A GREAT EXPRESS TRAIN RUSHING BY AND I WAS DRAWN BY ITS FORCE
HUAKIA TO CALL
BUT EXTENDED AS FAR NORTH AS PORTO RICO AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE SEISMIC WAVE WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE ALTERED THE OCEAN BED ROUND JAMAICA
WHILE DEEP CREVICES HAD BEEN FORMED ON THE LAND A STILL GREATER EFFECT HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN PRODUCED BENEATH THE WATER
A FLOCK OF THEM SQUAWKING AND CRYING MADE FOR OUR RIGGING AND PERCHED THERE THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE SCARED TO DEATH BUT THE QUEEREST PART OF IT ALL WAS THE WATER ITSELF IT WAS HOT NOT SO HOT THAT OUR FEET COULD NOT STAND IT WHEN IT WASHED OVER THE DECK
WE LEFT SAINT MICHAEL'S ON THE SAME DAY NOTHING WORTH WHILE TALKING ABOUT OCCURRED UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTERWARD WEDNESDAY MAY SEVENTH WE WERE PLODDING ALONG SLOWLY THAT DAY ABOUT NOON I TOOK THE BRIDGE TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION
TEN THEIR WEAPONS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE OLD WORLD AND MADE AFTER THE SAME PATTERN ELEVEN THEY DRANK TOASTS AND INVOKED BLESSINGS TWELVE THEY BUILT TRIUMPHAL ARCHES FOR THEIR RETURNING HEROES AND STREWED THE ROAD BEFORE THEM WITH LEAVES AND FLOWERS
ALONG ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS SO HOT THAT ALL HANDS GOT TO TALKING ABOUT IT WE RECKONED THAT SOMETHING QUEER WAS COMING OFF BUT NONE OF US COULD EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE PITCH SOFTENING IN THE SEAMS
EIGHT THEY POSSESSED CASTES AND THE TRADE OF THE FATHER DESCENDED TO THE SON AS IN INDIA NINE THEY HAD BARDS AND MINSTRELS WHO SUNG AT THE GREAT FESTIVALS
GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THOSE ON WATCH NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE
MIGHTY STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN ON THE SEA BUT THIS TOPPED THEM ALL I KEPT TO THE BRIDGE ALL NIGHT
FOUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA SO CHANGED AS TO RENDER THE OLD CHARTS USELESS
FOUR THE PRIEST EXAMINED THE ENTRAILS OF THE ANIMALS OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND LIKE THE ROMAN AUGURS DIVINED THE FUTURE FROM THEIR APPEARANCE
IN PERU WE FIND VASES WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME STYLE OF FACE
THE INCAS WERE SIMPLY AN OFFSHOOT WHO DESCENDING FROM THE MOUNTAINS SUBDUED THE RUDE RACES OF THE SEA COAST AND IMPOSED THEIR ANCIENT CIVILIZATION UPON THEM
A BEAUTIFUL SUMMER RESORT FREQUENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE ISLAND DURING THE HOT SEASON AS A PLACE OF RECREATION ALSO ESCAPED IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED THERE
THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT A FAIR SKINNED LIGHT HAIRED BEARDED RACE HOLDING THE RELIGION WHICH PLATO SAYS PREVAILED IN ATLANTIS CARRIED AN ATLANTEAN CIVILIZATION AT AN EARLY DAY UP THE VALLEY OF THE AMAZON TO THE HEIGHTS OF BOLIVIA AND PERU PRECISELY AS A SIMILAR EMIGRATION OF ARYANS WENT WESTWARD TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND CASPIAN AND IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THESE DIVERSE MIGRATIONS HABITUALLY SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
AND WANTED TO CUT DOWN MY TREE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING SNOW SHOES OUT OF IT AND THE ONLY WAY I COULD BUY HIM OFF WAS BY GIVING HIM TWO OF MY YOUNG ONES OH YOU FOOL CRIED THE CROW THE FOX WAS ONLY TRYING TO FRIGHTEN YOU
BUT PETER HAD NOT WAITED FOR THE END OF THIS SPEECH SCARCELY HAD HE SEEN EISENKOPF THAN HE DARTED LIKE THE WIND TO THE STABLE AND FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE HORSE'S BACK IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE WAS AWAY OVER THE MOUNTAIN
AND WAS CAREFUL TO DO EXACTLY ALL THE OLD WOMAN HAD TOLD HIM ON THE EIGHTH MORNING HE REACHED A FIRE SO LARGE THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE ON EITHER SIDE BUT WHEN HE STRUCK IT WITH THE NAPKINS IT PARTED AND STOOD ON EACH HAND LIKE A WALL
HE SAID YES BEAUTIFULLY JUST LISTEN AND THE FOX LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SANG WEEPING LOU LOU LOU THE FAMOUS SPINNER THE BAKER OF GOOD CAKES THE PRUDENT HOUSEKEEPER IS TORN FROM HER HUSBAND
AND OFFERED TO KEEP HIM FOR ANOTHER YEAR BUT PETER WAS HOME SICK AND BESIDES HE WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN PAID EVER SO SMALL A PIECE OF MONEY THAN A NUT FOR THOUGHT HE NUTS GROW ON EVERY TREE AND I CAN GATHER AS MANY AS I LIKE HOWEVER
WHEN I AM EATEN WHAT WILL YOU HAVE FOR YOUR NEXT DINNER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION SEEMED TO PUT OUT THE WOLF VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE FOR THEIR NEXT DINNER AND WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT STILL
IN THE PROPER STYLE THE HARE INSTANTLY OFFERED HER SERVICES
SO HE CALLED HIS SON AND SAID TO HIM MY DEAR BOY I HAVE NO LONGER ANY FOOD TO GIVE YOU AND YOU MUST GO INTO THE WORLD AND GET IT FOR YOURSELF IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT WORK YOU DO BUT REMEMBER
SHE CREPT UP TO HIS ROOM AND STOLE THE NAPKINS AND THEN SET OFF AS FAST AS SHE COULD TO THE FIRE BY A PATH SHE KNEW OF OVER THE HILL AT THE THIRD BLOW SHE GAVE THE FLAMES DIVIDED AND EISENKOPF
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING I AM WANDERING THROUGH THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GET WORK REPLIED PETER THEN STAY WITH ME FOR I CAN GIVE YOU PLENTY SAID THE OLD MAN AND PETER STAYED HIS WORK DID NOT SEEM HARD
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE FOX LET THE CROW GO THAN HE SOARED UP INTO THE AIR
THE DOG BEGAN TO HOWL QUICK MY SON QUICK YOU MUST GO CRIED THE OLD WOMAN AND THE LIGHTNING ITSELF WAS NOT QUICKER THAN PETER STOP A MOMENT CRIED THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN JUST AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE
AND THE MARTEN TOLD HIS STORY AND BEGGED THE HARE TO HELP THEM PULL THE HARE PULLED HER HARDEST AND AFTER A WHILE THEY WERE JOINED BY A FOX AND THEN BY A WOLF
LOU LOU LOU SHE IS GONE SHE IS GONE NOW AT LAST I HAVE FOUND SOME ONE WHO KNOWS THE ART OF LAMENTATION EXCLAIMED THE BEAR QUITE DELIGHTED AND HE LED THE FOX BACK TO HIS CAVE
AND WAS STOOPING FORWARD TO PECK AT HIS TONGUE WHEN THE FOX GAVE A SNAP AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE WING THE CROW KNEW THAT IT WAS OF NO USE STRUGGLING SO HE SAID AH BROTHER IF YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO EAT ME DO IT I BEG OF YOU IN GOOD STYLE
I HAVE A LITTLE DOG WHO WILL BEGIN TO HOWL WHEN EISENKOPF IS STILL SEVEN MILES OFF SO LIE ON THIS BED AND REST YOURSELF IN PEACE THEN SHE WENT TO THE KITCHEN AND BAKED A NUMBER OF CAKES MORE THAN PETER COULD HAVE EATEN IN A WHOLE MONTH
AS HE RODE THROUGH THE OPENING HE THREW THE CAKES BEHIND HIM FROM EACH CAKE THERE SPRANG A HUGE DOG AND HE GAVE THEM THE NAMES OF WORLD'S WEIGHT IRONSTRONG AND QUICK EAR THEY BAYED WITH JOY AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED WHY A FEW DAYS LATER
STRUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST A STONE AND WAS KILLED NOT LONG AFTER THE MARTEN CAME BY ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIS SUPPER SEEING THE DEAD MAN LYING THERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IS A PRIZE THIS TIME I HAVE DONE WELL
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU GODFATHER ASKED HE AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING I AM GOING TO FIND A MOURNER FOR MY WIFE ANSWERED THE BEAR OH DO CHOOSE ME CRIED THE FOX AND THE BEAR LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY CAN YOU HOWL WELL
PETER THEN TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY AND OF HIS STRIKING THE FLAMES WITH THE THREE NAPKINS AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO THE MAIDEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND WONDERED IN HERSELF WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE SO AFTER PETER HAD GONE OUT TO THE FIELDS
A GOOD DINNER AT ONCE TO ANY FRIENDSHIP FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL THERE WAS PLENTY OF GAME IN THE FOREST AND EVEN THE WOLF HAD AS MUCH TO EAT AS HE COULD WISH ONE MORNING THE FOX AS USUAL
I WISH YOU WOULD HELP ME TO DRAW THE SLEDGE THE SQUIRREL DID AS HE WAS ASKED AND THE SLEDGE MOVED SLOWLY ALONG BY AND BY A HARE CAME RUNNING ACROSS A FIELD BUT STOPPED TO SEE WHAT WONDERFUL THING WAS COMING
TILL ONE DAY WHEN HE AND HIS SON WERE SITTING IN THE ORCHARD WATCHING THEIR HERDS OF CATTLE GRAZING IN THE MEADOWS HE SUDDENLY SAID PETER MY BOY IT IS TIME THAT YOU WERE THINKING OF MARRYING BUT MY DEAR FATHER I TOLD YOU I CAN NEVER MARRY
PETER'S HEART WAS HEAVY AS HE SET OUT FOR HOME HE HAD CEASED TO LOVE THE WIFE WHOM HE HAD LEFT AT HIS WEDDING FEAST AND HIS HEART HAD GONE OUT TO THE GOLDEN HAIRED GIRL HOWEVER IT WAS NO USE THINKING OF THAT SO HE RODE FORWARD STEADILY
THE WOLF AND THE BEAR AGREED AND THEY TURNED OUT OF THE HOLLOW WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING AND CHOSE A PATH THAT LED UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE FOX TROTTED CHEERFULLY BY HIS TWO BIG COMPANIONS BUT ON THE WAY HE MANAGED TO WHISPER TO THE WOLF TELL ME PETER
WHO CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THEIR POULTRY YARD AND CARRIED OFF ONE OF THEIR FOWLS THE MAN LAID ALL SORTS OF TRAPS TO CATCH THE THIEF BUT INSTEAD OF CAPTURING THE FOE
HE CRIED WITH A LAUGH AH FOX
AND BADE HIM BEGIN HIS LAMENT OVER THE DEAD WIFE WHO WAS LYING STRETCHED OUT ON HER BED OF GREY MOSS BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT THE FOX AT ALL ONE CANNOT WAIL PROPERLY IN THIS CAVE HE SAID IT IS MUCH TOO DAMP
THE MAGICIAN'S SERVANTS HURRIED AFTER THE FRESH TRACKS BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BRIDGE THEY STOOD NOT KNOWING WHICH ROAD TO TAKE AS THE FOOTPRINTS STOPPED SUDDENLY AND THERE WERE THREE PATHS FOR THEM TO CHOOSE FROM
OUT OF HIS MIND WITH RAGE THE MAGICIAN ORDERED THE PRINCE TO BE PURSUED THEN A WILD CHASE BEGAN I HEAR HORSES HOOFS BEHIND US SAID HYACINTHIA TO THE PRINCE
THEN THE WHOLE THING DAWNED ON THE KING AND GROANING DEEPLY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
BUT THE THIRD TIME HE PERCEIVED A LITTLE FLY STEALING DOWN ONE CHEEK CAUSING IT TO BLUSH A FAINT PINK THEN THE PRINCE SEIZED THE GIRL'S HAND AND CRIED OUT THIS IS THE PRINCESS HYACINTHIA
BEFORE A CANDLE WHICH HE HAS LIT BURNS TO THE SOCKET I AM TO MAKE A PAIR OF BOOTS BUT WHAT DOES A PRINCE KNOW OF SHOEMAKING IF I CAN'T DO IT I LOSE MY HEAD AND
AND THE FLY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THE SECOND TIME HE PASSED THEM
THE BUSY COOK WAS JUST GOING TO REFUSE HER DEMAND AND ORDER HER OUT OF THE KITCHEN BUT THE WORDS DIED ON HIS LIPS WHEN HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE BEAUTIFUL HYACINTHIA AND HE ANSWERED POLITELY
AND WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THEY HAD LEFT NONE OF IT FOR HIM BUT HE PLUCKED THE CHERRIES AND TOOK THEM BACK TO HIS SISTER WHEN THE DRAKOS HEARD THAT JANNI HAD COME BACK HE FLED FOR FEAR FORTY FATHOMS UNDERGROUND
AND THE SISTER ATE THE CHERRIES AND DECLARED HERSELF WELL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WHEN JANNI WAS GONE TO HUNT THE DRAKOS CAME OUT AND ADVISED THE SISTER THAT SHE SHOULD PRETEND TO BE ILL AGAIN
AND WHEN JANNI ASKS WHAT AILS YOU AND WHAT YOU WANT YOU MUST ANSWER CHERRIES AND WHEN HE INQUIRES WHERE THESE ARE TO BE FOUND YOU MUST SAY
I WON'T BE YOUR ENEMY ANY MORE WELCOME TO THE UNDERWORLD ALL THE SAME FOR YOUR DELAY IN COMING HERE WE MUST DEMAND THREE SERVICES FROM YOU
AND HE AND HIS SISTER WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD SOON AFFAIRS WENT BADLY WITH THEM SO THEY DETERMINED TO WANDER AWAY TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNE IN PACKING UP THE SISTER FOUND A KNIFE WHICH THE MONK HAD LEFT FOR HIS GODSON
BUT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF SIGHED HYACINTHIA BUT LET IT BE AS YOU WISH GO AND I WILL AWAIT YOU HERE BUT I WILL FIRST CHANGE MYSELF INTO A WHITE MILESTONE
SWAM ABOUT IN THE WATER NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE PRINCE MILAN NOTICED THIRTY LITTLE WHITE GARMENTS LYING ON THE GRASS AND DISMOUNTING FROM HIS HORSE HE CREPT DOWN UNDER THE HIGH BULRUSHES TOOK ONE OF THE GARMENTS
HYACINTHIA PRINCE MILAN WENT PAST THEM AND LOOKED AT THEM CLOSELY BUT THEY WERE ALL SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ONE FACE REFLECTED IN THIRTY MIRRORS
AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP TO MORROW MORNING THE PALACE WILL BE FINISHED THEN YOU MUST GO ALL ROUND IT GIVING A TAP HERE AND THERE ON THE WALLS TO LOOK AS IF YOU HAD JUST FINISHED IT
AND THIS SHE GAVE TO HER BROTHER THEN THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY TAKING WITH THEM THE THREE SHEEP WHICH WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THEIR FLOCKS AFTER WANDERING FOR THREE DAYS THEY MET A MAN WITH THREE DOGS
THAT OUR OWN FATHER CAN HARDLY DISTINGUISH US APART THEN WHAT AM I TO DO ASKED PRINCE MILAN LISTEN ANSWERED HYACINTHIA
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MAGICIAN SENT FOR HIM AND SAID
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO ASKED HYACINTHIA WELL WHAT IS THERE TO BE DONE WHAT HE DEMANDS I CAN'T AND WON'T DO
AND EVERY DAY WENT OUT TO HUNT WITH THE WEAPONS THE DRAKEN HAD LEFT IN THE CASTLE ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS AWAY HUNTING ONE OF THE DRAKEN CAME UP TO GET PROVISIONS NOT KNOWING THAT THERE WAS ANYONE IN THE CASTLE
WASN'T THE LEAST AFRAID AND APPROACHED THE THRONE STILL ON HIS KNEES AT LAST THE MAGICIAN LAUGHED ALOUD AND SAID
THEN THE SISTER DID AS THE DRAKOS ADVISED AND NEXT DAY JANNI SET OUT TO FETCH THE CHERRIES TAKING HIS THREE DOGS WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE CHERRIES GREW HE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE
INTO A LITTLE BLUE FIELD FLOWER SHE SAID I WILL GROW HERE ON THE WAYSIDE TILL SOME PASSER BY TRAMPLES ME UNDER FOOT
THE SERVANTS CAME TO THE DOOR AND FINDING IT LOCKED THEY KNOCKED BUT THE FROZEN BREATH
THEN LAYING IT IN ITS CRADLE HE DETERMINED TO CONTROL HIS EMOTION AND BEGAN TO REIGN AGAIN AS BEFORE THE SECRET OF THE KING REMAINED A SECRET THOUGH HIS GRAVE CAREWORN EXPRESSION ESCAPED NO ONE'S NOTICE
JANNI AND THE DRAKEN ONCE THERE WAS A MAN WHO SHUNNED THE WORLD AND LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS HE OWNED NOTHING BUT A FLOCK OF SHEEP WHOSE MILK AND WOOL HE SOLD AND SO PROCURED HIMSELF BREAD TO EAT
THE HORSE NO SOONER RECOGNIZED HIS MASTER THAN IT NEIGHED LOUDLY WITH JOY AND SPRINGING TOWARDS HIM IT STOOD AS IF ROOTED TO THE GROUND WHILE PRINCE MILAN AND HYACINTHIA JUMPED ON ITS BACK
WHEN JANNI AWOKE AND BEHELD THE DOGS ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD HE THOUGHT AS BEFORE THAT THEY HAD KILLED A WILD BEAST AND WAS AGAIN ANGRY WITH THEM FOR LEAVING HIM NOTHING BUT HE TOOK THE QUINCES AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TO HIS SISTER
ALL BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES TO MORROW I WILL PLACE THE WHOLE THIRTY IN A ROW YOU MUST WALK PAST THEM THREE TIMES AND THE THIRD TIME YOU MUST SHOW ME WHICH IS MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER HYACINTHIA
