AND FOR HIS GUARD AND TOWARDS THE LIVING OF THE POORER PRISONERS PARTLY ON THIS ACCOUNT AND PARTLY TO AVOID A DOMESTIC SPY THEY KEPT NO SERVANT THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS WHO ACTED AS PORTERS AT THE COURTYARD GATE RENDERED THEM OCCASIONAL SERVICE
DON'T BE AFRAID TO HEAR ME DON'T SHRINK FROM ANYTHING I SAY
BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE
SAY THEN MY HUSBAND WHAT IS IT NEWS FROM THE OTHER WORLD HOW THEN CRIED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE OTHER WORLD
WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
AND TO LET IT FALL WITH A RATTLE ON THE LEDGE BEFORE HER AS IF THE AXE HAD DROPPED THE CITIZENESS IS SUPERB CROAKED THE JURYMAN SHE IS AN ANGEL SAID THE VENGEANCE AND EMBRACED HER
SYDNEY CARTON PAUSED IN THE STREET NOT QUITE DECIDED WHERE TO GO AT TELLSON'S BANKING HOUSE AT NINE HE SAID WITH A MUSING FACE SHALL I DO WELL IN THE MEAN TIME TO SHOW MYSELF I THINK SO
ALONE SHE WAS THROWN INTO A TRANSPORT BY THE TIDINGS MISTER LORRY GAVE HER OF HER HUSBAND AND CLASPED THE HAND THAT DELIVERED HIS NOTE LITTLE THINKING WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING NEAR HIM IN THE NIGHT AND MIGHT BUT FOR A CHANCE HAVE DONE TO HIM
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
EXTERMINATION IS GOOD DOCTRINE MY WIFE SAID DEFARGE RATHER TROUBLED IN GENERAL I SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT THIS DOCTOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN HIM TO DAY YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE WHEN THE PAPER WAS READ
WITH MARVELLOUS QUICKNESS AT A DISTANCE THE MORE READILY BECAUSE CERTAIN MEN WHO HAD BY SOME WONDERFUL EXERCISE OF AGILITY CLIMBED UP THE EXTERNAL ARCHITECTURE TO LOOK IN FROM THE WINDOWS KNEW MADAME DEFARGE WELL AND ACTED AS A TELEGRAPH BETWEEN HER AND THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE BUILDING
HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER FACE WITH HIS LIPS HE MURMURED SOME WORDS THE CHILD WHO WAS NEAREST TO HIM TOLD THEM AFTERWARDS AND TOLD HER GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SHE WAS A HANDSOME OLD LADY THAT SHE HEARD HIM SAY A LIFE YOU LOVE
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING
I WOULD DO ANYTHING IF MY CAREER WERE OF THAT BETTER KIND THAT THERE WAS ANY OPPORTUNITY OR CAPACITY OF SACRIFICE IN IT I WOULD EMBRACE ANY SACRIFICE FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE DEAR TO YOU
AS THE CAPTIVE OF MANY YEARS SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY BY TURNS AT MISTER LORRY AND AT DEFARGE SOME LONG OBLITERATED MARKS OF AN ACTIVELY INTENT INTELLIGENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD
HE WAS SO UNLIKE WHAT HE HAD EVER SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE AND IT WAS SO SAD TO THINK HOW MUCH HE HAD THROWN AWAY AND HOW MUCH HE EVERY DAY KEPT DOWN AND PERVERTED
IN THE PAUSES OF HIS QUICK AND LABOURED BREATHING HE WAS HEARD TO SAY WHAT IS THIS WITH THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER LIPS AND KISSED THEM TO HIM THEN CLASPED THEM ON HER BREAST AS IF SHE LAID HIS RUINED HEAD THERE
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
HE RESENTED MISSUS CRUNCHER'S SAYING GRACE WITH PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY NOW AGGERAWAYTER WHAT ARE YOU UP TO AT IT AGAIN HIS WIFE EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD MERELY ASKED A BLESSING
TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY
THAT THE TWO BEHOLDERS COVERED THEIR FACES
DON'T SAY THAT MISS MANETTE FOR YOU WOULD HAVE RECLAIMED ME IF ANYTHING COULD YOU WILL NOT BE THE CAUSE OF MY BECOMING WORSE SINCE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND THAT YOU DESCRIBE IS AT ALL EVENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOME INFLUENCE OF MINE
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
HAD IN A LONG SECLUSION FROM DIRECT LIGHT AND AIR
AT MONSIEUR WITH THE WHITE HEAD IT IS WELL FORWARD
IF WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM SHE SAID RAISING HER HAND TO MISTER LORRY AS HE STOOPED OVER THEM AFTER REPEATED BLOWINGS OF HIS NOSE
AND YET HE DID CARE SOMETHING FOR THE STREETS THAT ENVIRONED THAT HOUSE AND FOR THE SENSELESS STONES THAT MADE THEIR PAVEMENTS MANY A NIGHT HE VAGUELY AND UNHAPPILY WANDERED THERE WHEN WINE HAD BROUGHT NO TRANSITORY GLADNESS TO HIM
AND WHO DIED AND WENT TO HELL EVERYBODY FROM ALL THROATS THE NEWS IS OF HIM HE IS AMONG US AMONG US FROM THE UNIVERSAL THROAT AGAIN AND DEAD NOT DEAD HE FEARED US SO MUCH AND WITH REASON
BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
I KNOW HOW HARD IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO SUPPORT LIFE IN MYSELF BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO DESTROY LIFE IN YOU EVERY LEAN BARE ARM THAT HAD BEEN WITHOUT WORK BEFORE
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
TELL ME HOW AND WHY AM I AGAIN A PRISONER IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU RETURN STRAIGHT TO THE CONCIERGERIE AND WILL KNOW TO MORROW YOU ARE SUMMONED FOR TO MORROW DOCTOR MANETTE WHOM THIS VISITATION HAD SO TURNED INTO STONE
DIRECTLY DOWN UPON THE OLD PRISONER'S HEAD THE FAVOUR WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR IN AN INSTANT THE BARRIER OF DUST AND CHAFF THAT HAD STOOD SURPRISINGLY LONG WENT TO THE WINDS AND SAINT ANTOINE HAD GOT HIM
WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
I STATE THE CASE CITIZEN DEFARGE
OF HEALTH FOR THE SICKLIEST AND OF YOUTH FOR THE OLDEST SYDNEY'S FEET STILL TROD THOSE STONES FROM BEING IRRESOLUTE AND PURPOSELESS HIS FEET BECAME ANIMATED BY AN INTENTION AND IN THE WORKING OUT OF THAT INTENTION
YOU SEE HOW COMPOSED HE HAS BECOME AND YOU CANNOT BE AFRAID TO LEAVE HIM WITH ME NOW WHY SHOULD YOU BE IF YOU WILL LOCK THE DOOR TO SECURE US FROM INTERRUPTION I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM WHEN YOU COME BACK AS QUIET AS YOU LEAVE HIM IN ANY CASE
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
MADAME DEFARGE MET THE LIFTED EYEBROWS AND FOREHEAD WITH A COLD IMPASSIVE STARE MY DEAR SAID MISTER LORRY STRIKING IN TO EXPLAIN THERE ARE FREQUENT RISINGS IN THE STREETS
OF WHAT ASKED THE DOCTOR CITIZEN DOCTOR SAID THE FIRST WITH HIS FORMER RELUCTANCE ASK NO MORE IF THE REPUBLIC DEMANDS SACRIFICES FROM YOU
OR SNOOKS BROTHERS MIGHT BUT TELLSON'S THANK HEAVEN ANY ONE OF THESE PARTNERS WOULD HAVE DISINHERITED HIS SON ON THE QUESTION OF REBUILDING TELLSON'S IN THIS RESPECT THE HOUSE WAS MUCH ON A PAR WITH THE COUNTRY
AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
WEEP FOR IT IF YOU TOUCH IN TOUCHING MY HAIR ANYTHING THAT RECALLS A BELOVED HEAD THAT LAY ON YOUR BREAST WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG AND FREE WEEP FOR IT WEEP FOR IT IF WHEN I HINT TO YOU OF A HOME THAT IS BEFORE US
THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
AFTERWARDS SUPPING AT THEIR DOORS SCANTY AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPERS THOSE AND INNOCENT OF MEAT AS OF MOST OTHER SAUCE TO WRETCHED BREAD YET HUMAN FELLOWSHIP INFUSED SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE FLINTY VIANDS
HE NEVER LOOKED AT THE FIGURE BEFORE HIM WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING DOWN ON THIS SIDE OF HIMSELF THEN ON THAT AS IF HE HAD LOST THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATING PLACE WITH SOUND HE NEVER SPOKE WITHOUT FIRST WANDERING IN THIS MANNER AND FORGETTING TO SPEAK
YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE THE SHOEMAKER STOPPED HIS WORK LOOKED WITH A VACANT AIR OF LISTENING AT THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN SIMILARLY AT THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM THEN UPWARD AT THE SPEAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY
AND CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRCASE TO THEIR ROOMS THERE HE LAID HER DOWN ON A COUCH WHERE HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS WEPT OVER HER DON'T RECALL HER TO HERSELF HE SAID SOFTLY TO THE LATTER SHE IS BETTER SO DON'T REVIVE HER TO CONSCIOUSNESS
FOR THE SAKE OF HER CHILD AND HER FATHER PRESS UPON HER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING PARIS WITH THEM AND YOU AT THAT HOUR TELL HER THAT IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S LAST ARRANGEMENT
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
AND CLOSED THE DOOR COURAGE MY DEAR LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY AS HE RAISED HER COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU SPEED THOUGH MIND I EXPECT NOTHING WHEN ARE YOU LIKELY TO HAVE SEEN THESE DREAD POWERS DOCTOR MANETTE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DARK I SHOULD HOPE WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO FROM THIS
AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE IN THE GARRET BUT A PALLET BED AND HE AND MISTER LORRY ROUSED THE CAPTIVE AND ASSISTED HIM TO HIS FEET
IF I WERE DEAD THAT COULD NOT BE SURER THAN IT IS HENCEFORTH IN THE HOUR OF MY DEATH I SHALL HOLD SACRED THE ONE GOOD REMEMBRANCE AND SHALL THANK AND BLESS YOU FOR IT THAT MY LAST AVOWAL OF MYSELF WAS MADE TO YOU
DEFARGE IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS
WHEN THE CRY SEEMED TO GO UP ALL OVER THE CITY BRING HIM OUT BRING HIM TO THE LAMP DOWN AND UP AND HEAD FOREMOST ON THE STEPS OF THE BUILDING NOW ON HIS KNEES NOW ON HIS FEET NOW ON HIS BACK DRAGGED AND STRUCK AT
ONCE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING TWICE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING THEN THE ROPE WAS MERCIFUL AND HELD HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS SOON UPON A PIKE
HE CAME TO HER RELIEF WITH A FIXED DESPAIR OF HIMSELF WHICH MADE THE INTERVIEW UNLIKE ANY OTHER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOLDEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE MISS MANETTE
SAID HER FATHER STOPPING IN HIS STORY AND LAYING HIS HAND ON HERS COMMAND YOURSELF WHAT A DISORDERED STATE YOU ARE IN THE LEAST THING NOTHING STARTLES YOU YOU YOUR FATHER'S DAUGHTER
WITHIN AN HOUR WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
YET HE HAD SOME PLEASURE IN THE MERE SOUND OF HIS DAUGHTER'S VOICE AND INVARIABLY TURNED TO IT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THE SUBMISSIVE WAY OF ONE LONG ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY UNDER COERCION HE ATE AND DRANK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM TO EAT AND DRINK AND PUT ON THE CLOAK AND OTHER WRAPPINGS THAT THEY GAVE HIM TO WEAR
LOOKING SILENTLY ON AT THE MORNING TRAFFIC IN FLEET STREET WITH THEIR TWO HEADS AS NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE TWO EYES OF EACH WERE BORE A CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO A PAIR OF MONKEYS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT LESSENED BY THE ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE MATURE JERRY BIT AND SPAT OUT STRAW
THAT'S WELL I HAVE KNOWN SUCH ENERGY AS YOURS DO GREAT THINGS BEFORE NOW THOUGH NEVER HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AND A SIGH TOGETHER SUCH GREAT THINGS AS THIS BUT TRY
ONE OF THE FIRST CONSIDERATIONS WHICH AROSE IN THE BUSINESS MIND OF MISTER LORRY WHEN BUSINESS HOURS CAME ROUND WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF
ADVANCING HIS HAND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE HE TOOK IT UP AND LOOKED AT IT IN THE MIDST OF THE ACTION HE WENT ASTRAY AND WITH ANOTHER DEEP SIGH FELL TO WORK AT HIS SHOEMAKING BUT NOT FOR LONG RELEASING HIS ARM SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
HE HAD TAKEN IT UP AND WAS STOOPING TO WORK AGAIN WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS HE RAISED THEM AND SAW HER FACE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED FORWARD BUT SHE STAYED THEM WITH A MOTION OF HER HAND
AND SAID IN A LOWER VOICE AFTER A PAUSE WILL YOU ANSWER HIS QUESTION TO ME THEN HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN CITIZEN DOCTOR SAID THE FIRST RELUCTANTLY HE HAS BEEN DENOUNCED TO THE SECTION OF SAINT ANTOINE THIS CITIZEN
HE TOOK THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
HEAVEN GRANT I MAY CARTON BUT HOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT WILL DEPEND ON YOU AND IT COULD DEPEND ON NO BETTER MAN THIS NEW DENUNCIATION WILL CERTAINLY NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER TO MORROW
THE DOCTOR TURNED HIS EYES UPON THAT MAN WHO MOVED UNEASILY ON HIS FEET RUBBED HIS BEARD A LITTLE AND AT LENGTH SAID WELL TRULY IT IS AGAINST RULE BUT HE IS DENOUNCED AND GRAVELY
HIS HAGGARD EYES TURNED TO DEFARGE AS IF HE WOULD HAVE TRANSFERRED THE QUESTION TO HIM BUT AS NO HELP CAME FROM THAT QUARTER THEY TURNED BACK ON THE QUESTIONER WHEN THEY HAD SOUGHT THE GROUND I AM NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE NO I WAS NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE
WEEP FOR IT AND IF WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU OF MY NAME AND OF MY FATHER WHO IS LIVING AND OF MY MOTHER WHO IS DEAD
A STRANGE THRILL STRUCK HIM WHEN SHE DID SO AND VISIBLY PASSED OVER HIS FRAME HE LAID THE KNIFE DOWN SOFTLY AS HE SAT STARING AT HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WHICH SHE WORE IN LONG CURLS HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY PUSHED ASIDE AND FELL DOWN OVER HER NECK
BECAUSE THE LOVE OF MY POOR MOTHER HID HIS TORTURE FROM ME WEEP FOR IT WEEP FOR IT WEEP FOR HER THEN AND FOR ME GOOD GENTLEMEN THANK GOD I FEEL HIS SACRED TEARS UPON MY FACE AND HIS SOBS STRIKE AGAINST MY HEART O SEE
ALONG WITH TWO OF THE FOUR MEN WHO HAD TAKEN HIM LAST NIGHT AND BARSAD THE PEOPLE HAD ALL POURED OUT TO THE SHOW IN THE STREETS BARSAD PROPOSED TO THE REST LET HER EMBRACE HIM THEN IT IS BUT A MOMENT
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
FIVE YEARS LATER TELLSON'S BANK BY TEMPLE BAR WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE EVEN IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY IT WAS VERY SMALL VERY DARK VERY UGLY VERY INCOMMODIOUS
BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
CAUTIONS AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM HOUSE MUST AT SUCH A MOMENT RELIEVE THE FULNESS OF HER HEART WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO
WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST SIR AS YOU CAME IN WELL PROCEED BY ALL MEANS I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT
AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
VERY VERY MUCH INDEED ISABELLA PARTICULARLY
PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
THAT NO YOUNG LADY CAN BE JUSTIFIED IN FALLING IN LOVE BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S LOVE IS DECLARED IT MUST BE VERY IMPROPER THAT A YOUNG LADY SHOULD DREAM OF A GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN IS FIRST KNOWN TO HAVE DREAMT OF HER
IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND AND AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE AND TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE
AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
I DO LIKE IT SO VERY MUCH IF I COULD BUT HAVE PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE REST OF THEM HERE I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY JAMES'S COMING MY ELDEST BROTHER IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
MISSUS ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY THE DOOR AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW CATHERINE HOWEVER KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY
EXCELLENCE IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS ALLEN
IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A CROWD THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE TO WHOM THEY WERE ENTIRELY NEW AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY
VERY AGREEABLE INDEED SHE REPLIED VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A GREAT YAWN I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE SAID HIS WIFE I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER
SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
I AM VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED HIM IT WAS THE LAST THING I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DONE BUT DO NOT BE UNHAPPY ELEANOR AN ENGAGEMENT YOU KNOW MUST BE KEPT I AM ONLY SORRY IT WAS NOT RECOLLECTED SOONER THAT I MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN HOME
HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
ON HAVING PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO HAVE IT TORN
AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN THOUGHT DO YOU KNOW I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH
PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED
AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS IT WAS DEAR JOHN AND DEAR CATHERINE AT EVERY WORD DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY AND TWO DEARS AT ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND HER MANNERS JUST REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL HER PERSON PLEASING AND WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS PRETTY
CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE
HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION
WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
FURTHER PROVISION FOR GETTING UPSET I PACK CUSSEDNESS OF TOOTH BRUSHES GEORGE AND HARRIS PACK AWFUL BEHAVIOUR OF MONTMORENCY WE RETIRE TO REST
THEN IF BY ANY CHANCE HE REALLY DID CATCH ONE FISH HE CALLED IT TWENTY WHILE TWO FISH WOULD COUNT THIRTY THREE FORTY AND SO ON IT IS A SIMPLE AND EASILY WORKED PLAN
SO HE SLIPPED FROM THE NOISY REVEL TO STEAL A QUIET MOONLIGHT HOUR WITH HIS BELOVED
AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES
WHO WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD STAND THE SMELL REPLIED WHAT SMELL AND WHO WHEN TAKEN CLOSE TO THE CHEESES AND TOLD TO SNIFF HARD SAID SHE COULD DETECT A FAINT ODOUR OF MELONS
NEAR THEIR KING AND THE LONG ROAD TO THE PALACE GATES WAS GAY ALL DAY WITH CLANKING STEEL AND PRANCING PALFREYS AND RUSTLING SILKS AND VELVETS AND FAIR FACES THE LARGE AND SPACIOUS HOUSES WITH THEIR
IT WAS ARGUED FROM THIS THAT LITTLE INJURY COULD RESULT TO THE WOMAN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND SHE WAS LEFT THE HOTEL BILL CAME TO FIFTEEN GUINEAS AND MY FRIEND AFTER RECKONING EVERYTHING UP
BUT BIGGS'S BOYS ARE NOT AS A RULE TOUCHY HE CAME TO A DEAD STOP A YARD FROM OUR STEP
WHILE PEOPLE WHO DO CARE FOR IT HAVE TO PAY ENORMOUS PRICES TO GET IT IT SEEMS TO BE THE RULE OF THIS WORLD
WHO ARE PLAIN AND ELDERLY AND HAVEN'T GOT ANY LOVERS THEY THEMSELVES DON'T WANT LOVERS THEY NEVER MEAN TO MARRY IT DOES NOT DO TO DWELL ON THESE THINGS IT MAKES ONE SO SAD THERE WAS A BOY AT OUR SCHOOL
WHAT I SUFFER IN THAT WAY NO TONGUE CAN TELL FROM MY EARLIEST INFANCY I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT AS A BOY THE DISEASE HARDLY EVER LEFT ME FOR A DAY
THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW
THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
I HAVE SINCE BEEN INDUCED TO COME TO THE OPINION THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND MUST HAVE BEEN BEATING
AND SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE CARRIAGE TO OURSELVES AND HE LAUGHED PLEASANTLY AND SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE MADE SUCH A FUSS OVER A LITTLE THING BUT EVEN HE GREW STRANGELY DEPRESSED AFTER WE HAD STARTED AND SO WHEN WE REACHED CREWE
I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
AND THEY WOULD ALL COME AND HAVE A SNIFF AND THEN DROOP OFF AND SQUEEZE INTO OTHER CARRIAGES OR PAY THE DIFFERENCE AND GO FIRST FROM EUSTON I TOOK THE CHEESES DOWN TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE
AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK LATELY OF ITS BEING MADE USE OF BY THE ANGLING FRATERNITY IN GENERAL INDEED THE COMMITTEE OF THE THAMES ANGLER'S ASSOCIATION DID RECOMMEND ITS ADOPTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OPPOSED IT
UNDER A BLASTED OAK AND TOOK AN AWFUL OATH WE HAD BEEN SWEARING FOR A WHOLE WEEK ABOUT THE THING IN AN ORDINARY MIDDLE CLASS WAY BUT THIS WAS A SWELL AFFAIR
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW AND SUGGESTED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO THE ENTRANCE AND BEGIN AGAIN
I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AND FORGOT AS
AND GOT OUR CLOTHES WASHED WE HAD TRIED WASHING THEM OURSELVES IN THE RIVER UNDER GEORGE'S SUPERINTENDENCE AND IT HAD BEEN A FAILURE INDEED IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN A FAILURE
JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
THE PRESENCE OF YOUR HUSBAND'S CHEESES IN HER HOUSE SHE WOULD I INSTINCTIVELY FEEL REGARD AS A PUT UPON AND IT SHALL NEVER BE SAID THAT I PUT UPON THE WIDOW AND THE ORPHAN VERY WELL THEN SAID MY FRIEND'S WIFE RISING
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS A THIRD MAN CAME IN AND DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD CAUGHT IT EARLY ONE MORNING WITH BLEAK AND THEN HE LEFT AND A STOLID SOLEMN LOOKING MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUAL CAME IN
WE KNOW THAT IT IS BIGGS'S LATEST
ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS HE DIDN'T PUT UP AT THE PUBLIC HOUSES
AND TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE TOWN TO ESCAPE IT BUT IT FOLLOWED US THE WHOLE TOWN WAS FULL OF OIL WE PASSED THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN BURIED IN OIL THE HIGH STREET STUNK OF OIL
I WILL NOT TAKE UP YOUR TIME DEAR BOY WITH TELLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME LIFE IS BRIEF AND YOU MIGHT PASS AWAY BEFORE I HAD FINISHED BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT THE MATTER WITH ME I HAVE NOT GOT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE
PILED EVERYTHING IN A HEAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND SAT ROUND AND LOOKED AT IT I SAID I'D PACK I RATHER PRIDE MYSELF ON MY PACKING PACKING IS ONE OF THOSE MANY THINGS THAT I FEEL I KNOW MORE ABOUT THAN ANY OTHER PERSON LIVING
AND SPECULATE AS TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT DOG
WHICH YOU MIXED WITH WATER AND CALLED LEMONADE PLENTY OF TEA AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN CASE AS GEORGE SAID WE GOT UPSET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GEORGE HARPED TOO MUCH ON THE GETTING UPSET IDEA
YOU WILL BE NEARLY SURE TO MEET ONE OR TWO OLD ROD MEN SIPPING THEIR TODDY THERE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU ENOUGH FISHY STORIES IN HALF AN HOUR TO GIVE YOU INDIGESTION FOR A MONTH GEORGE AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HARRIS
AIN'T YOU GOING TO PUT THE BOOTS IN SAID HARRIS AND I LOOKED ROUND AND FOUND I HAD FORGOTTEN THEM THAT'S JUST LIKE HARRIS HE COULDN'T HAVE SAID A WORD UNTIL I'D GOT THE BAG SHUT AND STRAPPED OF COURSE AND GEORGE LAUGHED ONE OF THOSE IRRITATING SENSELESS
FOND AS I AM OF CHEESE THEREFORE I HOLD THAT GEORGE WAS RIGHT IN DECLINING TO TAKE ANY WE SHAN'T WANT ANY TEA SAID GEORGE HARRIS'S FACE FELL AT THIS BUT WE'LL HAVE A GOOD ROUND SQUARE SLAP UP MEAL AT SEVEN
IF I GAVE A MAN A SOVEREIGN TO TAKE THEM AWAY AND BURY THEM I ANSWERED THAT I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN AN IDEA STRUCK HER SHE SAID DO YOU MIND KEEPING THEM FOR HIM LET ME SEND THEM ROUND TO YOU
AND WILLIAM HARRIS TOLD US HOW HE FELT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AND GEORGE STOOD ON THE HEARTH RUG AND GAVE US A CLEVER AND POWERFUL PIECE OF ACTING ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW HE FELT IN THE NIGHT GEORGE FANCIES HE IS ILL
SO IT IS WITH THAT CHINA DOG
SHE SAID NOBODY'S LIKELY TO TOUCH THEM HAD HE SMELT THEM I THOUGHT HE HAD AND ADDED THAT HE SEEMED GREATLY ATTACHED TO THEM YOU THINK HE WOULD BE UPSET SHE QUERIED
YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU ARE EATING APPLE PIE OR GERMAN SAUSAGE OR STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM IT ALL SEEMS CHEESE THERE IS TOO MUCH ODOUR ABOUT CHEESE I REMEMBER A FRIEND OF MINE
NEVER HAVING ANYBODY TO LOOK AT WHILE THEY WORKED NOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT I CAN'T SIT STILL AND SEE ANOTHER MAN SLAVING AND WORKING I WANT TO GET UP AND SUPERINTEND AND WALK ROUND WITH MY HANDS IN MY POCKETS
IT WOKE HIM UP AND WITH A SNORT OF TERROR HE DASHED OFF AT THREE MILES AN HOUR THE WIND STILL BLEW IN HIS DIRECTION AND BEFORE WE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET HE WAS LAYING HIMSELF OUT AT THE RATE OF NEARLY FOUR MILES AN HOUR
HE COULDN'T FIND THEM AND HE WANDERED ABOUT TRYING TO GET TO THEM AND THEN HE GOT LOST
IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE ANGLER'S GUIDE TO THE THAMES SAYS THAT JACK AND PERCH ARE ALSO TO BE HAD ABOUT HERE BUT THERE THE ANGLER'S GUIDE IS WRONG
THEY MET SOME PEOPLE SOON AFTER THEY HAD GOT INSIDE
A STURGEON A FORTY POUND STURGEON TAKEN ON A LINE SIR YES YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED I'LL HAVE ANOTHER THREE OF SCOTCH LANDLORD PLEASE AND THEN HE GOES ON TO TELL OF THE ASTONISHMENT OF EVERYBODY WHO SAW IT
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
AN AWFUL OATH NEVER TO TAKE PARAFFINE OIL WITH US IN A BOAT AGAIN EXCEPT OF COURSE IN CASE OF SICKNESS THEREFORE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
SUPPOSING HARRIS SAY TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF AND BECAME A GREAT AND GOOD MAN AND GOT TO BE PRIME MINISTER AND DIED IF THEY WOULD PUT UP SIGNS OVER THE PUBLIC HOUSES THAT HE HAD PATRONISED HARRIS HAD A GLASS OF BITTER IN THIS HOUSE
BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
OR ELSE THE WINDSOR LOOP BUT THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THE KINGSTON TRAIN THOUGH WHY THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THEY COULDN'T SAY THEN OUR PORTER SAID HE THOUGHT THAT MUST BE IT ON THE HIGH LEVEL PLATFORM SAID HE THOUGHT HE KNEW THE TRAIN
FROM CREWE I HAD THE COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF THOUGH THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AS WE DREW UP AT THE DIFFERENT STATIONS THE PEOPLE SEEING MY EMPTY CARRIAGE WOULD RUSH FOR IT
AND TO GET YOU INTERESTED THEN HARRIS PACKED THE STRAWBERRY JAM ON TOP OF A TOMATO AND SQUASHED IT AND THEY HAD TO PICK OUT THE TOMATO WITH A TEASPOON AND THEN IT WAS GEORGE'S TURN AND HE TROD ON THE BUTTER I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
THERE WAS THE GLADSTONE AND THE SMALL HAND BAG AND THE TWO HAMPERS AND A LARGE ROLL OF RUGS AND SOME FOUR OR FIVE OVERCOATS AND MACINTOSHES AND A FEW UMBRELLAS
FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK
SPECIES UNKNOWN THAT OUR SARAH JANES NOW BREAK IN SHEER LIGHT HEARTEDNESS OF SPIRIT BE CAREFULLY MENDED AND STOOD UPON A BRACKET
THAT HAD SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT IT GEORGE PUT ON A PIPE AND SPREAD HIMSELF OVER THE EASY CHAIR AND HARRIS COCKED HIS LEGS ON THE TABLE AND LIT A CIGAR THIS WAS HARDLY WHAT I INTENDED WHAT I HAD MEANT OF COURSE
IT TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR HALF AN HOUR SIR TO LAND THAT FISH AND EVERY MOMENT I THOUGHT THE LINE WAS GOING TO SNAP I REACHED HIM AT LAST
OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE BUT GREAT CAESAR MAN EXPOSTULATED MY FRIEND
WILL BE HUNTED UP ALL CRACKED AND CHIPPED AND SOLD FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD AND RICH PEOPLE WILL USE THEM FOR CLARET CUPS AND TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN WILL BUY UP ALL THE
ANYHOW THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME
THERE IS REASON ON HIS SIDE CARVED OAK IS VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AND TO HAVE A LITTLE OF BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING TO LIVE IN FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO
THE LONG STRAIGHT ONES I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THOSE THERE IS ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M YESTERDAY AND ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET THERE AS EARLY AS TEN YOU KNOW
AND SOMETIMES IT BLEW A NORTHERLY OILY WIND AND MAYBE A SOUTHERLY OILY WIND BUT WHETHER IT CAME FROM THE ARCTIC SNOWS OR WAS RAISED IN THE WASTE OF THE DESERT SANDS IT CAME ALIKE TO US LADEN WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF PARAFFINE OIL
FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ILL FOR A DAY
HE SAID IT MADE HIM FEEL THAT LIFE WAS NOT AN IDLE DREAM TO BE GAPED AND YAWNED THROUGH BUT A NOBLE TASK FULL OF DUTY AND STERN WORK HE SAID HE OFTEN WONDERED NOW HOW HE COULD HAVE GONE ON BEFORE HE MET ME
AND I WAS JUST ABOUT GIVING IT UP AS A BAD JOB WHEN I SUDDENLY FELT A RATHER SMART PULL AT THE LINE I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER LITTLE ONE AND I WENT TO JERK IT UP
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
THE LADY UNDER WHOSE ROOF I HAVE THE HONOUR OF RESIDING IS A WIDOW AND FOR ALL I KNOW POSSIBLY AN ORPHAN TOO SHE HAS A STRONG I MAY SAY AN ELOQUENT OBJECTION TO BEING WHAT SHE TERMS PUT UPON
BECAUSE WE'VE WALKED A GOOD TWO MILES ALREADY HARRIS BEGAN TO THINK IT RATHER STRANGE HIMSELF BUT HE HELD ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY PASSED THE HALF OF A PENNY BUN ON THE GROUND THAT HARRIS'S COUSIN SWORE
THOUGHTLESS FRIENDS JEER AT IT AND EVEN MY LANDLADY HERSELF
WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
SO THAT YOU CAN SAY YOU'VE BEEN BUT IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S ABSURD TO CALL IT A MAZE YOU KEEP ON TAKING THE FIRST TURNING TO THE RIGHT
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN
GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR
WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN
THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE GREY OLD PALACE OF THE TUDORS ALL MADE A SUNNY PICTURE SO BRIGHT BUT CALM SO FULL OF LIFE AND YET SO PEACEFUL THAT EARLY IN THE DAY THOUGH IT WAS
AND I HAD TO GET INTO A CARRIAGE WHERE THERE WERE ALREADY SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE ONE CRUSTY OLD GENTLEMAN OBJECTED BUT I GOT IN NOTWITHSTANDING AND PUTTING MY CHEESES UPON THE RACK SQUEEZED DOWN WITH A PLEASANT SMILE AND SAID IT WAS A WARM DAY
AND YOUNG SINGLE FELLOWS CRY OUT THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEM POOR PEOPLE WHO CAN HARDLY KEEP THEMSELVES HAVE EIGHT HEARTY CHILDREN RICH OLD COUPLES WITH NO ONE TO LEAVE THEIR MONEY TO DIE CHILDLESS
HE SAID THAT BRINGING HOME THAT TROUT HAD SAVED HIM FROM A WHACKING AND THAT EVEN HIS SCHOOL MASTER HAD SAID IT WAS WORTH THE RULE OF THREE AND PRACTICE PUT TOGETHER HE WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM AT THIS POINT
AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
WE USED TO CALL HIM SANDFORD AND MERTON HIS REAL NAME WAS STIVVINGS
AFTER GEORGE HAD GOT IT OFF HIS SLIPPER THEY TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE KETTLE IT WOULDN'T GO IN AND WHAT WAS IN WOULDN'T COME OUT THEY DID SCRAPE IT OUT AT LAST AND PUT IT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND HARRIS SAT ON IT AND IT STUCK TO HIM
HE DID HIS BEST FOR THE MAN THAT PROPHESIES US BAD WEATHER ON THE CONTRARY WE ENTERTAIN ONLY BITTER AND REVENGEFUL THOUGHTS GOING TO CLEAR UP D'YE THINK WE SHOUT CHEERILY AS WE PASS
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
THERE IS REASON ON HIS SIDE CARVED OAK IS VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AND TO HAVE A LITTLE OF
THEY PICKED UP VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET IT OVER AS THEY WENT ALONG UNTIL THEY HAD ABSORBED ALL THE PERSONS IN THE MAZE
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
WE SAID THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD US SO BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DONE IT WELL IT'S A MOST REMARKABLE THING MOST REMARKABLE
WHY HERE IT IS ALL THE TIME HE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY WHERE CRIED HARRIS SPINNING ROUND STAND STILL CAN'T YOU ROARED GEORGE FLYING AFTER HIM AND THEY GOT IT OFF AND PACKED IT IN THE TEAPOT
UNTIL I AM BURNED OUT I RESPONDED AND THEN ON MY WAY DOWN THE STEPS I TURNED AROUND SUDDENLY DOCTOR I ASKED AT A VENTURE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A CHILD NAMED LUCIEN WALLACE
LIDDY REPORTED THAT EVERYTHING WAS SERENE AMONG THE SERVANTS AND THAT NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY THE NOISE THE MADDENING THING HOWEVER WAS THAT THE NIGHTLY VISITOR HAD EVIDENTLY MORE THAN ONE WAY OF GAINING ACCESS TO THE HOUSE AND
AND YET ONE OF THE MOST INEXPLICABLE OCCURRENCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK PLACE THAT VERY NIGHT LIDDY CAME TO MY ROOM ON SUNDAY MORNING WITH A FACE AS LONG AS THE MORAL LAW SHE LAID OUT MY THINGS AS USUAL
THE VOICES CEASED AT ONCE A DOOR CLOSED SOMEWHERE AND THE DOCTOR ENTERED FROM THE HALL OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY SURPRISED AT SEEING ME GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR I SAID FORMALLY
I PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER LITTLE LUCIEN AND SAT WITH HER UNTIL THE INTERVALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS GREW SHORTER AND FINALLY CEASED ALTOGETHER
AS SURE AS YOU SIT THERE THERE'S THE SMELL OF THE GRAVEYARD ON THEM
THAT IS UNLESS YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY ONE CROSSING THE LAWN OR SKULKING AROUND THE HOUSE DID YOU
THAT ONE IS MERELY CURIOUS THIS ONE AS I SAID BEFORE IS PUZZLING
IN ANSWER SHE POINTED TO THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THAT NECESSARY ADJUNCT OF THE MIGRATORY DOMESTIC THE TOP WAS COVERED WITH FINE WHITE PLASTER AS WAS THE FLOOR BUT THERE WERE NO LARGE PIECES OF MORTAR LYING AROUND NO BITS OF LATHING
ABOVE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN HER EYES LOOKED BIG AND SOMBER AND THE RAPID DRIVE HAD BROUGHT NO COLOR TO HER FACE I GOT UP AND DREW FORWARD A CHAIR HE HAS NOT COME BACK I SAID QUIETLY SIT DOWN CHILD
BUT I GUESS I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER MY TRUNK'S PACKED WHO PACKED IT I ASKED EXPECTING FROM HER TONE TO BE TOLD SHE HAD WAKENED TO FIND IT DONE BY SOME GHOSTLY HAND I DID MISS RACHEL YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THIS HOUSE IS
WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO COME UP FOR TWO GIRLS AND THEIR TRUNKS I SUPPOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING AND AS THIS HERE WOMAN HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE VILLAGE I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER ALONG ALREADY I HAD ACQUIRED THE TRUE SUBURBANITE ABILITY TO
AND A VISIT TO ELIZA'S ROOM PROVED IT I MIGHT JEER ALL I WISHED SOME ONE HAD DRILLED A HOLE IN THE UNFINISHED WALL OF THE BALL ROOM PASSING BETWEEN THE BRICKS OF THE PARTITION AND SHOOTING THROUGH THE UNRESISTING PLASTER OF ELIZA'S ROOM WITH SUCH FORCE
I SHALL DREAM OF IT TO NIGHT GET UP FLINDERS
A NEW ELEMENT WAS ABOUT TO ENTER INTO AFFAIRS MONDAY OR TUESDAY AT THE LATEST WOULD FIND DOCTOR WALKER BACK IN HIS GREEN AND WHITE HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE AND LOUISE'S ATTITUDE TO HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
I WAS UP THERE MYSELF AT THE FIRE HE SAID VOLUBLY I'M A MEMBER OF THE VOLUNTEER COMPANY
ANNE TOOK THE CHILD FROM THE HOME AND HID HIM IN A FARMHOUSE NEAR CASANOVA ON THE CLAYSBURG ROAD THERE SHE WENT SOMETIMES TO SEE THE BOY
SHOT HE SAID BLESS MY SOUL NO
PAUL ARMSTRONG HAD A BESETTING EVIL THE LOVE OF MONEY COMMON ENOUGH BUT HE LOVED MONEY NOT FOR WHAT IT WOULD BUY BUT FOR ITS OWN SAKE AN EXAMINATION OF THE BOOKS SHOWED NO IRREGULARITIES IN THE PAST YEAR SINCE JOHN HAD BEEN CASHIER
THE PAPERS HAVE KEPT THE PUBLIC WELL INFORMED OF MY SHARE IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET CHAMBER THEY HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY SILENT THE INNER HISTORY HAS NEVER BEEN TOLD MISTER JAMIESON GOT ALL KINDS OF CREDIT AND SOME OF IT HE DESERVED
HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE
TO STOP WITH A SHUDDER WHERE THE FLOOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAS BLACK VOID AND DARKNESS FROM WHICH CAME THE INDESCRIBABLE DAMP SMELL OF THE CELLARS
YES SHE COULD COOK WAS NOT A FANCY COOK BUT COULD MAKE GOOD SOUPS AND DESSERTS IF THERE WAS ANY ONE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SALADS AND SO IN THE END I TOOK HER AS HALSEY SAID WHEN WE TOLD HIM
LOOKING AT HIS WATCH EVERY FEW MINUTES AND HE ATE ALMOST NOTHING HE ASKED TWICE DURING THE MEAL ON WHAT TRAIN MISTER JAMIESON AND THE OTHER DETECTIVE WERE COMING
SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD ROOM WINDOW
I SPOKE INSTEAD OF AN ANSWER WHOEVER IT WAS TURNED AND RAN UP I FOLLOWED IT WAS DARK BUT AS I TURNED THE CORNER AT THE TOP A FIGURE DARTED THROUGH THIS DOOR AND CLOSED IT
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS KIND OF THING I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN HEARD ME HE HAS NOT COME BACK SHE ASKED LOOKING FROM ME TO GERTRUDE
AND GERTRUDE ALWAYS APPREHENSIVE LATELY WAS AT THE DOOR ALMOST INSTANTLY A MOMENT LATER LOUISE HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD THERE BAREHEADED AND BREATHING HARD WHERE IS HALSEY SHE DEMANDED
I WENT UP THE WALK TO THE HOUSE WHERE A BRASS SIGN AT THE SIDE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICE AND WENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT FROM THE CONSULTING ROOM BEYOND CAME THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES NOT VERY AMICABLE
COMING JUST AFTER THE FIRE THE HOUSEHOLD WAS DEMORALIZED AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME TO FIND ALEX AND THE UNDER GARDENER STRUGGLING DOWN STAIRS WITH A HEAVY TRUNK BETWEEN THEM
ONE BY ONE THEY HAD DIED AND BEEN BURIED BESIDE THEIR PARENTS IN A LITTLE TOWN IN THE MIDDLE WEST THERE WAS ONLY ONE SISTER LEFT THE BABY LUCY
GERTRUDE FINALLY GOT A TRAP FROM THE CASANOVA LIVERYMAN AND WE WENT OUT JUST AS WE TURNED FROM THE DRIVE INTO THE ROAD WE PASSED A WOMAN
THE CONNIVANCE OF DOCTOR WALKER WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS LOVE FOR LOUISE THE MAN WAS UNSCRUPULOUS AND WITH THE GIRL AS A BAIT PAUL ARMSTRONG SOON HAD HIM FAST THE PLAN WAS APPARENTLY THE ACME OF SIMPLICITY A SMALL TOWN IN THE WEST
UNTIL THE MONEY HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM THEY STEPPED INTO THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CAR TO STOP IT AND FATE PLAYED INTO THEIR HANDS THE CAR STRUCK THE TRAIN AND THEY HAD ONLY TO DISPOSE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE IN THE ROAD THIS THEY DID AS I HAVE TOLD
I ASKED UNCEREMONIOUSLY IGNORING THE STRANGER DID HE NOT MEET YOU NO MISTER JAMIESON LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED I RATHER EXPECTED THE CAR BUT WE GOT UP ALL RIGHT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL
YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER IT'S MY OPINION ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND AND GETTING JOLTED OUT OF A RUT HAS STIRRED UP THAT TORPID LIVER OF YOURS IT'S NOT MYSELF I'M THINKING ABOUT SHE SAID GOADED INTO SPEECH
THROUGH GOOD TEMPER AND BAD THE IDEA
JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN WHERE WAS IT
HE DUG HIS FORK INTO MY DAMASK CLOTH AND DID NOT HEAR WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO HE REFUSED DESSERT AND LEFT THE TABLE EARLY EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ALEX
WE PUT LOUISE IN A STEAMER CHAIR AND SHE SAT THERE PASSIVELY ENOUGH HER HANDS CLASPED IN HER LAP WE WERE VERY SILENT
HE GOT A PIECE OF CANDLE AND BY ENLARGING THE APERTURE A LITTLE WAS ABLE TO EXAMINE WHAT LAY BEYOND THE RESULT WAS NIL THE TRUNK ROOM ALTHOUGH HEATED BY STEAM HEAT LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
AND ENTITLED TO HIS FATHER'S SHARE OF THE ESTATE THE PAPERS WERE IN HER TRUNK AT SUNNYSIDE
SO HE COULD TALK TO MISS LOUISE A THANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH NONSENSE I SAID BRUSKLY I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ENOUGH TO LEAVE THEM IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE YOU AND I WERE IN LOVE LIDDY AND
AND YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ANYTHING THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T HANDCUFF
AND I WENT I LEFT MISTER JAMIESON AND THE DAY DETECTIVE GOING OVER EVERY INCH OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE POUNDING PROBING AND MEASURING
AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED INJURY WAS FOUND IN A HEAPED UP BASKET OF CLOTHES UNDER THE CHUTE THE BASKET HAD BEEN OVERTURNED BUT THAT WAS ALL MISTER JAMIESON EXAMINED THE WINDOWS ONE WAS UNLOCKED AND OFFERED AN EASY ESCAPE
THEN MORE LIGHTLY WHY YOU AND LIDDY NEED ME TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN YOU EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK PERHAPS I WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE
HE HAD GROWN INTO A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND HE WAS ALL ANNE HAD TO LIVE FOR THE ARMSTRONGS LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA AND ARNOLD'S PERSECUTIONS BEGAN ANEW HE WAS FURIOUS OVER THE CHILD'S DISAPPEARANCE
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
SHE HEARD A SOUND AS SHE WENT DOWN THE CORRIDOR
HE DID HE ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK WITHOUT MY GETTING MORE THAN A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE I HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF UNFAMILIAR FEATURES AND OF A SORT OF CAP WITH A VISOR THEN HE WAS GONE I WENT TO THE LODGE AND RAPPED
HE WAS SWEARING SOMETHING SICKENING DID THEY GO TOWARD THE CLUB GERTRUDE ASKED SUDDENLY LEANING FORWARD NO MISS I THINK THEY CAME INTO THE VILLAGE
TO CLOSING IT FOR THE NIGHT SAM BOHANNON CAME AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE AND BEGAN HIS PATROL OF THE GROUNDS AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO DETECTIVES TO LOOK FORWARD TO
BUT LIDDY SELDOM REPLIED TO MY GIBES SHE FOLDED HER LIPS A LITTLE TIGHTER HE CALLED HER UP SHE SAID ORACULARLY HE CALLED HER UP
THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT MISTER JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
TO SEE LOUISE SHE ASKED NO I WANT TO ASK THIS YOUNG WALKER SOMETHING SHE WAS CURIOUS I KNEW
SAD PART OF MY ERRAND HERE TO DAY IS TO SEE IF YOU WILL RELINQUISH YOUR LEASE HERE IN THEIR FAVOR WE WOULD BETTER WAIT AND SEE IF THEY WISH TO COME I SAID IT SEEMS UNLIKELY AND MY TOWN HOUSE IS BEING REMODELED AT THAT HE LET THE MATTER DROP
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE A VISIT FROM LOUISE THAT DAY WAS DESTINED TO BE AN EVENTFUL ONE FOR WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND FOUND ELIZA ENSCONCED IN THE UPPER HALL ON A CHAIR WITH MARY ANNE DOING HER BEST
CERTAINLY I HAD LEFT THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW WAY I WAS ROUSED BY HEARING MISTER JAMIESON COMING RAPIDLY BACK THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM HE STOPPED AT THE DOOR MISS INNES HE SAID QUICKLY WILL YOU COME WITH ME AND LIGHT THE EAST CORRIDOR
THE SECOND MISSUS ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN A WIDOW WITH A CHILD A LITTLE GIRL THIS CHILD NOW PERHAPS TWENTY WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAVING TAKEN HER STEPFATHER'S NAME AND WAS AT PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FAMILY
I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS MISERABLE HOUSE TO NIGHT ANNIE MORTON IS GOING TO SCOTLAND NEXT WEEK AND YOU SHALL GO RIGHT WITH HER TO MY SURPRISE SHE FLUSHED PAINFULLY I DON'T WANT TO GO AUNT RAY SHE SAID
IT HAS COLLIDED WITH A FREIGHT CAR ON THE SIDING ABOVE THE STATION
THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
FAINTING CORRECTED ROSIE I'D A BEEN HIT ON THE HEAD AND KILLED I WISHT YOU'D HEARD HER SCREAM PUT IN MARY ANNE AND HER FACE AS WHITE AS A PILLOW SLIP WHEN SHE TUMBLED DOWN THE STAIRS
BECAUSE I AND MY FAMILY ARE JUST NOW IN A MOST AMBIGUOUS POSITION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE UNDERSTOOD ME OR NOT HE TOOK OF HIS GLASSES AND WIPED THEM
I WONDERED VAGUELY IF MY ORIGINAL IDEA OF A SECRET ENTRANCE TO A HIDDEN CHAMBER COULD BE RIGHT AFTER ALL AND IF WE WERE HOUSING SOME ERRATIC GUEST WHO PLAYED PRANKS ON US IN THE DARK AND DESTROYED THE WALLS THAT HE MIGHT LISTEN HIDDEN SAFELY AWAY
AND HE TOOK THE OWL TRAIN TO TOWN THE ODDEST THING TO ME WAS THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT ALEX WAS JACK BAILEY BUT THE FACE OF THE PSEUDO GARDENER WAS VERY QUEER INDEED WHEN THAT NIGHT IN THE CARD ROOM THE DETECTIVE TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
AND I SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR IT TO ME MISTER JAMIESON WAS FAR LESS FORMIDABLE UNDER MY EYES WHERE I KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT TOO WAS RIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
IT WAS QUITE DARK BUT SHE COULD SEE HIS WHITE SHIRT BOSOM FROM THE FOURTH STEP SHE FIRED AS HE FELL SOMEBODY IN THE BILLIARD ROOM SCREAMED AND RAN WHEN THE ALARM WAS RAISED
IF I COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN HALSEY COMING AT HIS USUAL HARE BRAINED CLIP UP THE DRIVE IF I COULD HAVE HEARD THE THROB OF THE MOTOR I WOULD HAVE FELT THAT MY TROUBLES WERE OVER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN THE COUNTRYSIDE LAY SUNNY AND QUIET
HIS FACE CHANGED AND STIFFENED HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AGAIN IN A MOMENT
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARROWING PERIOD FOR ALL OF US WITH THE BOY IN DANGER BUT YOUNG PEOPLE REFUSE TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR ELDERS AND SOMETIMES THE ELDERS ARE THE ONES TO SUFFER
RANG THAT BELL SO HARD I HADN'T TIME SCARCELY TO GET EM ON AND DID YOU SEE A MAN WHO LIMPED GERTRUDE PUT IN AS HE STOPPED FOR BREATH
WARNER CAME IN THEN WITH A HANDFUL OF SMALL TOOLS AND MISTER JAMIESON WENT WITH HIM TO THE BASEMENT ODDLY ENOUGH I WAS NOT ALARMED WITH ALL MY HEART I WISHED FOR HALSEY BUT I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED AT THE DOOR HE WAS TO FORCE WARNER PUT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND LOOKED AT IT
HE HAS GONE TO THE STATION FOR MISTER JAMIESON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE STATION
IT IS SHE FLICKED THE HORSE'S STUBBY MANE WITH THE WHIP HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A LIVERY HORSE AND THE LIVERYMAN SAID HE HAD BOUGHT HIM FROM THE ARMSTRONGS WHEN THEY PURCHASED A COUPLE OF MOTORS AND CUT DOWN THE STABLE NICE FLINDERS GOOD OLD BOY
HAVE LEARNED NOT TO MIND IF THE COOK SITS DOWN COMFORTABLY IN MY SITTING ROOM WHEN SHE IS TAKING THE ORDERS FOR THE DAY
TAKE MY HORSE AND TRAP OUTSIDE AND DRIVE LIKE MAD TRY TO FIND THE DRAGON FLY IT OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER WAY ONLY DON'T LOSE A MOMENT THE NEW DETECTIVE HAD GONE AND A MOMENT LATER
HE NEVER BUILT A HOUSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT IF IT IS THIS HOUSE IT MAY MEAN ANYTHING FROM A SECRET ROOM TO AN EXTRA BATH ROOM I SAID SCORNFULLY HAVEN'T YOU A THUMB PRINT TOO I HAVE HE SAID WITH A SMILE
YES I SAID LISTEN THERE IS THE WHISTLE OF THE TRAIN NOW SHE RELAXED A LITTLE AT OUR MATTER OF FACT TONE AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO SINK INTO A CHAIR PERHAPS I WAS WRONG SHE SAID HEAVILY HE
I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MISTER ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE ONE IS CURIOUS THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B INNES
MISTER JAMIESON CAME IN WE MIGHT TAKE UP THE CONVERSATION WHERE WE LEFT OFF AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO HE SAID BUT BEFORE WE GO ON I WANT TO SAY THIS THE PERSON WHO ESCAPED FROM THE LAUNDRY WAS A WOMAN WITH A FOOT OF MODERATE SIZE AND WELL ARCHED
I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU FROM YOUR PATIENT I WISH MERELY TO ASK YOU A QUESTION WON'T YOU SIT DOWN IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY DOCTOR
IN ITS PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOON CALM AND FAR DOWN THE DRIVE MISTER JAMIESON WAS WALKING SLOWLY STOOPING NOW AND THEN AS IF TO EXAMINE THE ROAD WHEN I WENT BACK MISTER HARTON WAS FURTIVELY WIPING HIS EYES
WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
WILL BE HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS
HOWEVER I PUT THE BAG IN THE BACK OF MY MIND WHICH WAS FAST BECOMING STORED WITH ANOMALOUS AND APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE FACTS AND FOLLOWED WARNER TO THE HOUSE LIDDY HAD COME BACK TO THE KITCHEN
TOOK A NAP ALL RIGHT I SAID GO ON
MADAME SWEENY HAD BOTCHED HER NEW GOWN WHEN I FINISHED LIDDY WAS BEHIND ME HER MOUTH A THIN LINE I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO LOOK CHEERFUL LIDDY I GROANED YOUR FACE WOULD SOUR MILK
THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE I SAID AND IN CAME ELIZA FLANKED BY ROSIE AND MARY ANNE HER STORY BROKEN WITH SOBS AND CORRECTIONS FROM THE OTHER TWO WAS THIS AT TWO O'CLOCK TWO FIFTEEN
BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN THE DAY OF THE MOTOR CAR HAD COME NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE KEEPERS THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
I TRIED TO WARN HIM NONSENSE I SAID
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER THAT WAS THAT AUBREY WALLACE SHOULD EDUCATE HIS BOY
WHO NEARLY WENT MAD WITH JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN SOON THERE CAME A DAY WHEN THE WHOLE COURT WAS ORDERED TO BE PRESENT AT THE CHRISTENING OF THE ROYAL BABIES AND WHEN ALL WAS READY THE QUEEN SOFTLY OPENED THE WINDOW A LITTLE
FOR A BABY OF HER OWN TO LAY BESIDE IT IN COURSE OF TIME THIS CAME ALSO AND THE QUEEN TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL OUT OF THE BASKET AND PLACED IT WITH HER SON IN A GOLDEN CRADLE WHICH GLITTERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES NEXT SHE SENT FOR THE KING
I HAVE SAID ALREADY GET AWAY REPLIED HANNAH QUITE ANGRILY YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF ME BY YOUR GAMES YOU MONSTROSITY OH DEAR OH DEAR SHE MUST BE WANDERING IN HER MIND MURMURED THE LAD TO HIMSELF
SAID THE VOICE SHUT UP HERE TILL
HE REMINDED HIMSELF THAT HE MUST GET BACK TO HIS MOTHER BUT WHENEVER HE TRIED TO ROUSE HIMSELF TO GO HE SANK BACK AGAIN DROWSILY AND AT LAST HE FELL SOUND ASLEEP IN THE CORNER OF THE SOFA STRANGE DREAMS CAME TO HIM
AND THE PRINCESS FELL ON HER KNEES AND BEGGED SHE MIGHT DIE WITH HIM YOU ARE OUT IN YOUR RECKONING SIR SULTAN SAID VIRGILIUS WHOSE PATIENCE WAS AT AN END AND HE CAST A SPELL OVER THE SULTAN AND HIS LORDS
THE POOR LITTLE BABIES HAD FOUND NO REST EVEN IN THEIR GRAVES IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THERE SPRANG UP TWO BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ASPENS AND THE STEPMOTHER WHO HATED THE SIGHT OF THE TREES WHICH REMINDED HER OF HER CRIME
THOUGH IT NEARLY BROKE HIS HEART HE MUST GIVE ORDERS FOR HER PUNISHMENT SO HE WENT OUT SADLY AND TOLD HIS GUARDS THAT THE EMPRESS WAS TO BE BURIED IN THE EARTH UP TO HER NECK
THE BABY IS NOT REALLY OURS BUT BELONGS TO AN OGRESS ARE YOU MAD CRIED THE WIFE
AND GIVE THEM AS A PRESENT TO THE EMPEROR DO NOT TAKE US THERE FOR THAT IS WHENCE WE CAME AND YONDER LIES OUR DESTRUCTION SAID ONE OF THE FISHES BUT WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH YOU ASKED THE FISHERMAN
I WILL NOT DO A STROKE MORE THAN I HAVE PROMISED AND THAT IS FROM DAWN TO DARK SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT A FEW WEEKS LATER THE MINISTER WAS ASKED TO ATTEND A CHRISTENING IN THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN HE BADE HANS COME WITH HIM
YOU HAD BETTER ASK URBAN THE BARBER WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY TO LEND YOU HIS GOOD MORNING SO SAYING HE GENTLY PUSHED JEM INTO THE STREET SHUT THE DOOR AND WENT BACK TO HIS WORK JEM STEPPED ACROSS TO THE BARBER
HAVING SETTLED HIS AFFAIRS WITH THE EMPEROR AND HIS ENEMIES VIRGILIUS HAD TIME TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS AND HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO FALL IN LOVE
THE JUDGE THANKED HIM JOYFULLY AS HE TOOK THE APPLES AND WENT TO SEEK HIS WIFE EAT THESE APPLES AT ONCE HE CRIED AND YOU WILL HAVE TWELVE SONS SO SHE SAT DOWN AND ATE ELEVEN OF THEM BUT JUST AS SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH
AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT THE BOY STRUGGLED TO BE FREE SAYING DEAR FATHER PUT ME DOWN I HAVE GOT A NEW MOTHER WHO IS BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE AND A NEW FATHER WHO IS BETTER THAN YOU THEN HIS FATHER SAT HIM DOWN AND SAID
AS THE DRAGON MIGHT RETURN DIRECTLY SO THEY TOOK TWO HORSES OUT OF THE STABLE AND RODE AWAY AT LIGHTNING SPEED HARDLY WERE THEY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE PALACE THAN THE DRAGON CAME HOME AND FOUND THAT HIS PRISONER HAD FLOWN
AND HIS MOTHER ANSWERED VERY WELL TO MORROW I WILL BUY HIM A DONKEY AND YOU CAN ALL GO TOGETHER SO THE DONKEY WAS BOUGHT AND THE NEIGHBOURS CAME AND THEY WORKED HARD ALL DAY AND IN THE EVENING
IN THE HOPE THAT HIS PRESENCE MIGHT BE A RESTRAINT UPON THEM THE MINISTER USED TO SIT AT THE TABLE DURING HIS SERVANTS MEALS AND WOULD EXHORT THEM TO DRINK MUCH AND OFTEN THINKING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EAT AS WELL
AS HIS FATHER SPOKE THINGS GREW CLEARER TO JEM'S MIND AND HE SAW NOW THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING BUT HAD REALLY SERVED THE OLD WOMAN SEVEN YEARS IN THE SHAPE OF A SQUIRREL AS HE THOUGHT IT OVER RAGE FILLED HIS HEART
I WILL LET DOWN A ROPE AND IF YOU TIE IT TIGHTLY ROUND YOU I WILL DRAW IT UP ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE OGRESS FASTENING THE ROPE WHICH HALFMAN LET DOWN NOW PULL ME UP
AND WE WILL TAKE IT TO THE TOWN AND SELL IT AND WILL DIVIDE THE MONEY WITH YOU THE FOLLOWING DAY EACH MAN BROUGHT EVERY BOWL AND VESSEL HE COULD FIND AT HOME AND HASSEBU FILLED THEM ALL WITH HONEY
NO THE REAL HERB YOU'LL NEVER FIND WHY HAD YOUR MOTHER NOT GOT IT IN HER BASKET THE CHILD COULD NOT THINK WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE SOUP WHICH TASTED MOST DELICIOUS
THE QUEEN WAS ABOUT TO REPLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WAS ALREADY LIMPING AWAY AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE TWO STEPS SHE HAD TURNED INTO A YOUNG GIRL WHO MOVED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE SEEMED RATHER TO FLY THAN TO WALK
BUT ALL STOPPED IN SURPRISE AT FINDING A MAN LYING ON THE KING'S OWN BED THE SOLDIERS WISHED TO KILL HIM AT ONCE BUT THE KING SAID LEAVE HIM ALONE PUT ME ON A CHAIR AND THE SOLDIERS
HISSING GROANING SOUND WAS HEARD THE GIRL QUICKLY PUSHED VASSILI INTO A CHEST UNDER THE BED LOCKED IT AND WHISPERED LISTEN TO WHAT THE SERPENT AND I TALK ABOUT THEN SHE ROSE UP TO RECEIVE THE SERPENT KING
AND THERE YOU WILL FIND A LARGE STONE BUILT INTO THE WALL BUT NOT CEMENTED LIKE THE REST THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE MOON IS FULL AND AT MIDNIGHT YOU MUST GO TO THE SPOT AND GET THE STONE OUT OF THE WALL WITH A PICKAXE UNDER THE STONE LIES A GREAT TREASURE
AND ONE DAY AS HE WAS PLAYING IN THE STREET WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN THE OGRESS CAME BY GO TO YOUR FATHER SHE SAID AND REPEAT THIS SPEECH TO HIM I WANT MY FORFEIT WHEN AM I TO HAVE IT ALL RIGHT REPLIED THE CHILD
AND WHATSOEVER HE WAS TAUGHT HE DID NOT LEARN IT HIS MOTHER NEVER WISHED HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE SO SHE SAID WELL STAY AT HOME MY SON AND HE STAYED AT HOME EATING AND SLEEPING
THE GIRL'S MOTHER HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HER DAUGHTER WOULD BE EMPRESS AND NOT THE MILKWHITE MAIDEN THE CHILD OF A MERE SHEPHERD SO SHE HATED THE GIRL WITH ALL HER HEART AND ONLY BIDED HER TIME TO DO HER ILL
BUT THE WIFE OF HALFMAN WAS THE PRETTIEST OF THEM ALL AND THE OTHER BROTHERS WERE JEALOUS AND SAID TO EACH OTHER WHAT IS HE WHO IS ONLY HALF A MAN TO GET THE BEST LET US PUT HIM TO DEATH AND GIVE HIS WIFE TO OUR ELDEST BROTHER
AND BETRAYED ME WELL THIS TIME YOU HAD BETTER GO TO THE WOLVES
AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE COBBLER'S STALL LOOK HERE SAID SHE THIS CREATURE SAYS HE IS OUR LOST SON HE HAS BEEN TELLING ME HOW HE WAS STOLEN SEVEN YEARS AGO AND BEWITCHED BY A FAIRY
THE HEADLESS DWARFS THERE WAS ONCE A MINISTER WHO SPENT HIS WHOLE TIME IN TRYING TO FIND A SERVANT WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE TO RING THE CHURCH BELLS AT MIDNIGHT IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER DUTIES
BUT YOUR OTHER SORROW IS MUCH OLDER THAN THIS YOUR HAPPINESS IS SPOILT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CHILDREN AT THESE WORDS THE QUEEN BECAME SCARLET AND TRIED TO DRAW AWAY HER HAND BUT THE OLD WOMAN SAID
HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT THE MAGICIAN BUT WITH A GREAT EFFORT STRUGGLED TO OPEN HIS BLACK BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM WHAT SPELLS TO USE IN AN INSTANT ALL HIS FOES SEEMED TURNED TO STONE
AND WHEN HE WENT OUT HE SAID TO HIS PLAY FELLOWS LOOK HOW SMART I AM I AM GOING AWAY WITH MY AUNT TO FOREIGN LANDS AT THAT MOMENT THE OGRESS CAME UP AND ASKED HIM
AND BEGAN TO COAX HIM WITH ALL SORTS OF PRETTY WAYS IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE BAIT TOOK BUT AT LENGTH EVEN EMPERORS ARE ONLY MEN WELL WELL HE SAID AT LAST HAVE YOUR WAY AND CUT DOWN THE TREES
I TURN ROUND BECAUSE I HAVE NO EYES IN THE BACK OF MY NECK SAID HANS CEASE TALKING NONSENSE REPLIED THE MINISTER AND GIVE ALL YOUR MIND TO GETTING US TO THE TOWN BEFORE NIGHTFALL HANS DID NOT ANSWER BUT RODE ON STEADILY
BUT I THINK I SHALL GET THE BETTER OF YOU NOW AND HE WAITED A MONTH AND WAS VERY KIND AND PLEASANT TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE SAID TO VASSILI ONE DAY
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN SO LONG IN COMING ASKED HE WHEN THEY HAD FOUND HIM OH DEAR UNCLE WE WERE VERY NEARLY NOT COMING AT ALL REPLIED THEY WE FELL IN WITH AN OGRESS WHO TOOK US HOME AND WOULD HAVE KILLED US IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HALFMAN
THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT TO BE MOVED ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO URGE ME TO BREAK MY WORD SAID HE IF YOU WANT TO REACH THE TOWN TO NIGHT YOU MUST GO ALONE THE HOUR OF MY FREEDOM HAS STRUCK AND I CANNOT GO WITH YOU
I AM THE KING OF THE SNAKES WAS THE REPLY AND THIS IS MY PALACE
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT YOU
AS SHE SPOKE SHE SHUFFLED TOWARDS THE HAMPER OF CABBAGES TOOK UP ONE AFTER ANOTHER SQUEEZED THEM HARD AND THREW THEM BACK MUTTERING AGAIN BAD STUFF BAD STUFF
WHEN MARK SAW VASSILI HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WITH HIS WIFE HOW DARED YOU MARRY MY DAUGHTER WITHOUT MY CONSENT HE ASKED I ONLY CARRIED OUT YOUR ORDERS SAID SHE HERE IS YOUR LETTER MARK READ IT
DON'T TALK SUCH NONSENSE TO THE CHILD SAID THE MOTHER AT LAST IF YOU WISH TO BUY PLEASE MAKE HASTE AS YOU ARE KEEPING OTHER CUSTOMERS AWAY VERY WELL I WILL DO AS YOU ASK SAID THE OLD WOMAN WITH AN ANGRY LOOK
BUT REJOICE THAT IT IS PERMITTED TO ME TO SHOW YOU A WAY TO LESSEN YOUR GRIEF YOU MUST HOWEVER PROMISE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU IF ANY GOOD IS TO COME OF IT OH I WILL OBEY YOU EXACTLY CRIED THE QUEEN
THOUGH EVERY NOW AND THEN HE CAST A GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD THE SUN SANK ALTOGETHER THEN HANS REINED UP HIS HORSE TOOK HIS KNAPSACK AND JUMPED OUT OF THE SLEDGE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ARE YOU MAD
AND THE FLOUR FROM THEM HE MADE INTO SOFT BREAD FOR THE TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN IN THIS WAY HE PASSED FROM ONE KIND OF SERVICE TO ANOTHER SPENDING A YEAR IN EACH TILL IN THE FOURTH YEAR HE WAS PROMOTED TO THE KITCHEN
AND HALFMAN WHISPERED TO HIS BROTHERS GET UP AND RUN FOR YOUR LIVES AS THE OGRESS IS KILLING HER DAUGHTERS THE BROTHERS NEEDED NO SECOND BIDDING AND IN A MOMENT WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE
THE POOR WHALE HAS BEEN LYING THREE YEARS ACROSS THE STRAIT AND MEN AND HORSES HAVE NEARLY TRAMPLED HIS BACK INTO HIS RIBS IS HE TO LIE THERE MUCH LONGER I WILL REMEMBER SAID VASSILI AND HE WENT ON HE WALKED AND WALKED
AND BADE THEM WAKE THE STRANGER GENTLY AND THEY WOKE HIM AND HE SAT UP AND SAW MANY SNAKES ALL ROUND HIM AND ONE OF THEM VERY BEAUTIFUL DECKED IN ROYAL ROBES WHO ARE YOU ASKED HASSEBU
HAVE WHISPERED IN THE WOOD WE HAVE SUNG IN THE WATERS BUT NOW WE WISH TO TELL YOU A STORY WHICH YOU KNOW WITHOUT KNOWING IT IN THE SPEECH OF MEN AND A SECOND CUSHION FELL DOWN LET THEM TAKE THEIR SILLINESS HOME
COME TO ME O MARE OF THE MOUNTAIN WITCH THE PRINCE DID AS HE WAS BID AND AS THE HAIR TOUCHED HIS FINGERS THE WOLF CHANGED BACK INTO A MARE WITH THE FOAL BESIDE HER AND WHEN HE HAD MOUNTED AND RIDDEN HER HOME THE OLD WOMAN WAS ON THE STEPS TO RECEIVE THEM
WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS BOTH HER SISTERS PUT TOGETHER AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE ALONE COULD BE ONE SUMMER DAY WHEN THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE POURING DOWN ON THE EARTH THE THREE SISTERS WENT TO THE WOOD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO PICK STRAWBERRIES
THE DAUGHTERS OF YOUR UNCLE HAVE WAITED FOR YOU IN VAIN AND SHE BADE US FOLLOW HER TO THE HOUSE SAYING NOW THERE NEED BE NO MORE DELAY YOU CAN MARRY YOUR COUSINS AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE AND TAKE THEM WITH YOU TO YOUR OWN HOME BUT I WARNED MY BROTHERS THAT THE MAN WAS NOT OUR UNCLE BUT AN OGRE
AND LAID THEIR WHITE CLOTH OVER HIS BROTHERS NEXT HE DREW THEIR SCARLET CAPS FROM THEIR HEADS AND EXCHANGED THEM FOR THE VEILS WHICH THE OGRE'S DAUGHTERS WERE WEARING THIS WAS HARDLY DONE
WHEN THEY HAD DONE DRINKING HALFMAN WHO WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM CALLED OUT THROW ME THE ROPE AND DRAW ME UP FOR I CANNOT GET OUT ALONE AND THE BROTHERS THREW HIM A ROPE TO DRAW HIM UP THE STEEP BANK
HE THOUGHT THE OLD WOMAN TOOK OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES AND WRAPPED HIM UP IN A SQUIRREL SKIN AND THAT HE WENT ABOUT WITH THE OTHER SQUIRRELS AND GUINEA PIGS WHO WERE ALL VERY PLEASANT AND WELL MANNERED AND WAITED ON THE OLD WOMAN
AND SAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR OWN FACE ONCE MORE AND IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT IN A MOMENT BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO ENDURE A LITTLE LONGER YET THEN WARNING HER ONCE MORE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BASKET THE LADY BADE THE GIRL FAREWELL
RUBBISH SAID THE CHILD TO HERSELF AND TURNING THREW THE WING OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW IN A MOMENT A BEAUTIFUL LADY STOOD BESIDE HER DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID THE LADY STROKING DOTTERINE'S HEAD
SO THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO LAY THE EGG IN IT IT MIGHT NOT RISK ANY HARM THREE MONTHS PASSED AND AS THE OLD WOMAN HAD BIDDEN HER THE QUEEN TOOK THE EGG FROM HER BOSOM AND LAID IT SNUGLY AMIDST THE WARM WOOLLEN FOLDS
AND AT MIDNIGHT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED A THICK CLOUD SUDDENLY FILLED THE HALL SO THAT FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS DARK THEN THE MIST SUDDENLY GREW BRIGHT
WHEN HE HAD LIVED SEVEN YEARS WITH THE OLD WOMAN SHE ORDERED HIM ONE DAY AS SHE WAS GOING OUT TO KILL AND PLUCK A CHICKEN STUFF IT WITH HERBS AND HAVE IT VERY NICELY ROASTED BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK
TILL AT LAST HIS FATHER ASKED HIM IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU YOUNG GENTLEMAN SHALL I MAKE YOU A PAIR OF SLIPPERS OR PERHAPS WITH A SMILE CASE FOR YOUR NOSE WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH MY NOSE ASKED JEM
HIS LEGS WERE SMALL AND SPINDLY BUT HIS ARMS WERE AS LARGE AS THOSE OF A WELL GROWN MAN WITH LARGE BROWN HANDS AND LONG SKINNY FINGERS THEN HE REMEMBERED THE MORNING WHEN HE HAD FIRST SEEN THE OLD WOMAN
LONG LONG AGO THERE WAS BORN TO A ROMAN KNIGHT AND HIS WIFE MAJA A LITTLE BOY CALLED VIRGILIUS WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE LITTLE HIS FATHER DIED AND THE KINSMEN
HAD GONE TO THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE WHERE HE HAD SOME SOUP AND A LITTLE NAP AND NOW WHEN HE CAME BACK THEY WERE ALL TALKING OF SEVEN YEARS AND THEY CALLED HIM A HORRID DWARF
BUT SUDDENLY AS SHE STOOD WEEPING HER EYES FELL UPON THE GOLDEN CASE IN WHICH LAY THE PRECIOUS BASKET SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT CONTAIN SOMETHING TO AMUSE HER AND LOOKED EAGERLY INSIDE
FOR MANY DAYS DOTTERINE WANDERED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT FINDING SHELTER AND THOUGH THE FOOD WHICH SHE GOT FROM THE BASKET PREVENTED HER FROM STARVING SHE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO TAKE SERVICE IN A PEASANT'S HOUSE TILL BRIGHTER DAYS DAWNED
AND SAW HE WAS THE DWARF HE HAD FOUND SEATED IN THE CHURCH BELL AH SAID THE DWARF SEATING HIMSELF QUIETLY UNDER THE TREE YOU LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT SOME DAY I MIGHT DO YOU A GOOD TURN NOW YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT
ASKED THE MINISTER BUT HANS ANSWERED QUIETLY THE SUN IS SET AND MY WORK IS OVER AND I AM GOING TO CAMP HERE FOR THE NIGHT IN VAIN THE MASTER PRAYED AND THREATENED AND PROMISED HANS A LARGE REWARD IF HE WOULD ONLY DRIVE HIM ON
YOU WILL INVITE ME TO BE GODMOTHER TO THE PRINCESS AND THIS IS HOW YOU MUST SEND THE INVITATION HIDDEN IN THE CRADLE YOU WILL FIND A GOOSE'S WING THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I WILL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY
ONE DAY THREE VERY POOR OLD MEN CAME BEGGING TO THE DOOR AND JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO LET THE FIERCE DOGS LOOSE ON THEM HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER ANASTASIA
WHICH BLOSSOMED AND BORE FRUIT EACH NIGHT BUT EVERY MORNING THE FRUIT WAS GONE AND THE BOUGHS WERE BARE OF BLOSSOM WITHOUT ANYONE BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER WHO WAS THE THIEF AT LAST THE EMPEROR SAID TO HIS ELDEST SON
WHY HE WAS THERE AND HOW HE HAD LEARNT THE WAY AND HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER UNLESS THE EMPRESS HERSELF CAME AND GAVE HIM LEAVE A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO HER AND WHEN SHE STOOD AT THE GATE THE PRINCE THOUGHT
AND THEN HE CREPT IN TO THE EMPRESS WHO TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD LEARNT FROM HER GAOLER
THE GIRL WEPT BITTERLY FOR HIS LOSS BUT IN SECRECY AS SHE HAD TOLD HER MISTRESS NOTHING ABOUT HER PAST LIFE AT THE END OF A YEAR OF MOURNING THE YOUNG KING LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE INTENDED TO MARRY
AND IN SOME SMALLER BASKETS EARLY PEARS APPLES AND APRICOTS JEM CRIED HIS WARES AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE THIS WAY GENTLEMEN SEE THESE LOVELY CABBAGES AND THESE FRESH HERBS
I AM GOING TO THE HOUSE OF MARK THE MERCHANT AND HAVE A LETTER FOR HIS WIFE REPLIED VASSILI SHOW US THE LETTER VASSILI HANDED THEM THE LETTER THEY BLEW ON IT AND GAVE IT BACK TO HIM SAYING NOW GO AND GIVE THE LETTER TO MARK'S WIFE
FROM THAT DAY THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND EVERY MORNING CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EMPEROR COMPLAINING OF THE ROBBERIES MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED NIGHTLY IN THE STREETS
HER FACE COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR A VEIL COVERED HER HEAD BUT AS SHE CAME UP TO THE PLACE WHERE THE QUEEN WAS STANDING WITH THE BABIES SHE DREW THE VEIL ASIDE AND EVERYONE WAS DAZZLED WITH HER BEAUTY
SHE WAS SO WEAK AND MISERABLE THAT DIRECTLY HER GODMOTHER APPEARED SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND COULD NOT SPEAK FOR SOME TIME DO NOT CRY SO DEAR CHILD SAID THE GODMOTHER I WILL CARRY YOU AWAY FROM ALL THIS
THE EMPEROR DID AS VIRGILIUS ADVISED BUT THIEVES AND MURDERERS LAUGHED AT THE HORSE AND WENT ABOUT THEIR MISDEEDS AS USUAL BUT AT THE LAST STROKE OF THE BELL
AS LONG AS YOU DELIVER ME FROM MY BROTHER AND GET ME MY WIFE MOUNT ON MY BACK THEN AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE SHALL BE THERE THE OGRESS WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD AND IN A FEW MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN WHERE HALFMAN AND HIS BROTHERS LIVED
THE NOME KING THINKING HIMSELF WHOLLY MASTER OF THE SITUATION WAS LAUGHING AND JEERING AT HIS PRISONERS WHEN POLYCHROME EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL AND DANCING LIKE A RAY OF LIGHT ENTERED THE CAVERN OHO CRIED THE KING A
AND POSSESSES NO MAGIC POWERS WHATEVER
CRIED THE COLONELS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
NO ONE CAN RESCUE ME NOW OH BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT SAID SHAGGY THERE IS A NEW KING OF THE NOMES NAMED KALIKO IN RUGGEDO'S PLACE AND HE HAS PROMISED YOU SHALL GO FREE FREE I DARE NOT GO FREE
AND THE SKIN OF ONE ARM WAS BRIGHT YELLOW AND THE SKIN OF THE OTHER ARM A VIVID GREEN HE HAD ONE BLUE LEG AND ONE PINK ONE WHILE BOTH HIS FEET WHICH SHOWED THROUGH THE OPEN SANDALS HE WORE WERE JET BLACK
GONE WHERE THEY LEFT NO ADDRESS YOUR MAJESTY BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THE PIT
AND PICKED UP THEIR DISCARDED SWORDS PRIVATE FILES SEIZE AND BIND THESE PRISONERS SCREAMED THE QUEEN NO SAID FILES THROWING DOWN HIS GUN AND REMOVING THE KNAPSACK WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HIS BACK I RESIGN MY POSITION AS THE ARMY OF OOGABOO
WHEN RUGGEDO FIRST CAPTURED ME I WAS VERY HANDSOME DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHAGGY NOT VERY WELL BROTHER YOU WERE SO YOUNG WHEN I LEFT HOME BUT I REMEMBER THAT MOTHER THOUGHT YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS RIGHT
RENDERED DESPERATE BY THEIR SAD CONDITION THE OFFICERS EXHIBITED COURAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY LEFT HOME
WHERE I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ASKED BETSY HER VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE THROUGH NERVOUSNESS WHY
AND THE BEAUTIFUL ROSE PRINCESS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE AND I WON'T DO IT HE ASSERTED YOU MUST CRIED ANN IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY ORDERS I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY ORDERS FROM MY OFFICERS OBJECTED THE PRIVATE
I BELIEVE THE MAGICIAN WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY AND PROBABLY HE WENT MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE GOING IT'S FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME REMARKED SHAGGY GENTLY REMOVING POLYCHROME'S HEEL FROM HIS LEFT EYE
I ENLISTED TO FIGHT THE ENEMY AND BECOME A HERO BUT IF YOU WANT SOME ONE TO BIND HARMLESS GIRLS YOU WILL HAVE TO HIRE ANOTHER PRIVATE THEN HE WALKED OVER TO THE OTHERS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH SHAGGY AND TIK TOK
AND HERE IS PRINCESS OZGA OF ROSELAND JUST NOW UNFORTUNATELY EXILED FROM HER KINGDOM OF ROSES I NEXT PRESENT POLYCHROME A SKY FAIRY WHO LOST HER BOW BY AN ACCIDENT AND CAN'T FIND HER WAY HOME
BUT SOON THEY GAINED COURAGE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE PECULIAR PERSON AS HE WAS A TYPE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LAND WHOM THEY AFTERWARD MET I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE HIS FACE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT LACKED EXPRESSION
CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL BUT WE STARTED OUT TO CONQUER HIM WHICH ISN'T AS FRIENDLY AS IT MIGHT BE TRUE AGREED THE MAN HE LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THEM FOR A WHILE
SHE TURNED AWAY IN A SHAMEFACED MANNER FOR ANN AND HER OFFICERS WERE INDEED A SIGHT TO BEHOLD HER MAJESTY'S CLOTHING ONCE SO RICH AND GORGEOUS WAS NOW WORN AND TORN INTO SHREDS BY HER LONG CRAWL THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHICH BY THE WAY
THEY ALL STOOD LOOKING FROM ONE ROAD TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY THE PATHS RADIATED FROM THE LITTLE CLEARING LIKE THE RAYS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND EACH PATH SEEMED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS FILES AND THE ROSE PRINCESS WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
QUITE DISCONCERTED BY THIS UNEXPECTED EFFECT OF THE MAGNET SHAGGY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE QUEEN'S ENCIRCLING ARMS AND QUICKLY HID THE TALISMAN IN HIS POCKET THE ADVENTURERS FROM OOGABOO WERE NOW HIS FIRM FRIENDS
MERCY KIND ENEMIES MERCY SPARE US AND WE WILL BE YOUR SLAVES FOREVER THE OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAD NOW ADVANCED INTO THE CLEARING LIKEWISE FELL UPON THEIR KNEES AND BEGGED FOR MERCY
NO ONE SAID PANG THE COVER WAS THERE BUT THE PRISONERS WERE NOT UNDER IT IN THAT CASE SNARLED THE KING
YELLED THE GENERALS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
THEN SINCE THEY ARE NOW HELPLESS WHY NOT RELEASE THEM AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE BECAUSE I HATE EM AND MEAN TO MAKE EM SUFFER FOR THEIR INVASION BUT I'LL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU SWEET POLLY REMAIN HERE AND LIVE WITH ME
AND RUGGEDO PRESENTED A COMICAL SIGHT FOR SURELY NO MAN EVER BEFORE HAD SO MANY POCKETS OR ANY AT ALL FILLED WITH SUCH A CHOICE COLLECTION OF PRECIOUS STONES HE NEGLECTED TO THANK THE YOUNG LADIES FOR THEIR KINDNESS BUT GAVE THEM A SURLY NOD OF FAREWELL
THAT IS A KINDLY DEED REPLIED UGLY IN A SAD VOICE BUT I DREAD TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD IN THIS DIREFUL CONDITION UNLESS I REMAIN FOREVER MASKED MY DREADFUL FACE WOULD CURDLE ALL THE MILK AND STOP ALL THE CLOCKS
I WONDER WHAT IS THE BEST AND SUREST WAY TO WAKEN A DRAGON
AND THE NEW ARRIVALS IN THIS STRANGE LAND FOUND IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE MANY CREATURES AROUND THEM WHO WERE INVISIBLE YET COULD BE HEARD PLAINLY SHALL I WIND HIM UP ASKED BETSY FEELING VERY SORRY FOR TIK TOK
SO I BELIEVE I'LL GO IN RIGHT AWAY AND PUT AN END TO ALL THIS WORRY
ALL OF WHOM WERE NEARLY AS EVIL LOOKING AS THEIR HATED MASTER THEY BORE GREAT GOLDEN PINCERS AND PRODS OF SILVER AND CLAMPS AND CHAINS AND VARIOUS WICKED LOOKING INSTRUMENTS
YOU WILL CARRY THE GUN THAT MISTER FILES USED A SOL DIER MUST BE A BLE TO RUN AS WELL AS TO FIGHT PROTESTED TIK TOK
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH IT INVISIBLE HANDS RAISED TIK TOK FROM THE MARBLE BASIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BESIDE IT WATER DRIPPING FROM EVERY JOINT OF HIS COPPER BODY
CLEVERLY MADE OF TWIGS AND GOLDEN BRANCHES WOVEN TOGETHER AS THEY APPROACHED THE PLACE THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A FORM THAT DARTED INTO THE HUT AND SLAMMED THE DOOR TIGHT SHUT AFTER HIM SHAGGY MAN RAN TO THE DOOR AND CRIED ALOUD BROTHER
THEN SHE TURNED TO SHAGGY AND ASKED ARE YOU SURE HE HASN'T SEEN THE LOVE MAGNET I'M POSITIVE ANSWERED SHAGGY BUT YOU SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF A LOVE MAGNET YOURSELF POLYCHROME SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID TO RUGGEDO
FOR HANK MADE NO DISTINCTION IN FAVOR OF A LADY WHO WAS AN OPEN ENEMY BETSY GRABBED HER CHAMPION BY THE FORELOCK HOWEVER AND SO HELD HIM FAST AND WHEN THE OFFICERS SAW THAT THE MULE WAS RESTRAINED FROM FURTHER ATTACKS THEY CREPT FEARFULLY BACK
BECAUSE ALL TUBES ARE MADE THAT WAY BUT THIS TUBE IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVERYONE IS FORBIDDEN TO FALL INTO IT WE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE EXPLAINED BETSY AND POLYCHROME ADDED I AM QUITE SURE THAT RUGGEDO THE NOME KING PUSHED US DOWN THAT TUBE HA
BUT AS HE HAD NO PLACE TO GO HE STOOD BY AND FACED HIS FORMER SERVANT WHO WAS NOW KING IN HIS PLACE IN A HUMBLE AND PLEADING MANNER
THEY BECOME PRETTY TAME I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SHAGGY MY DEAR BROTHER IS VERY WISE TO PREFER REAL TREES TO THE IMITATION ONES BUT COME LET US GO THERE AND FIND HIM SHAGGY STARTED FOR THE GREEN GROVE AT ONCE
ONCE BETSY'S HEELS FLEW UP AND STRUCK A SIMILAR SUBSTANCE OVERHEAD THEY WERE INDEED DESCENDING THE HOLLOW TUBE THAT LED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD STOP HANK STOP CRIED THE GIRL
WHICH SWUNG BACK AND FORTH DURING THE SWIFT JOURNEY AND POMMELED EVERYONE WITHIN THEIR REACH NOW FOLLOWED QUEEN ANN WHO HAD STRUCK THE TUBE IN A SITTING POSITION AND WENT FLYING ALONG WITH A DASH AND ABANDON THAT THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED THE POOR LADY
WHO HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER THEN A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY BUT UNSEEN BY THE OTHERS IN THE INKY DARKNESS SLID BETSY AND HANK WHILE BEHIND THEM WERE SHAGGY AND POLYCHROME AND FINALLY FILES AND THE PRINCESS
AND UNLESS RUGGEDO'S EYES BEHELD THE TALISMAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIM AS FOR BETSY BOBBIN AND HER MULE HE BELIEVED KALIKO HAD PLACED THEM IN THE SLIMY CAVE WHILE ANN AND HER OFFICERS HE THOUGHT SAFELY IMPRISONED IN THE PIT
HIS SILK STOCKINGS HAD HOLES IN THEM AND HIS SHOES WERE STUB TOED AND NEEDED BLACKENING BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WHISPERED BETSY WHEN THE POOR MAN HAS BEEN A PRISONER FOR SO MANY YEARS SHAGGY HAD DARTED FORWARD
HAD LED HER DIRECTLY INTO THE METAL FOREST IT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE THREE SECRET PASSAGES AND BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE THREE ANN HAD NOT ONLY TORN HER PRETTY SKIRT AND JACKET BUT HER CROWN HAD BECOME BENT AND BATTERED
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AROUND HER SHE SAW THE QUEEN AND THE PECULIAR PERSON STRUGGLING TOGETHER UPON THE GROUND WHERE THE MAN WAS TRYING TO CHOKE ANN AND SHE HAD BOTH HANDS IN HIS BUSHY HAIR AND WAS PULLING WITH ALL HER MIGHT SOME OF THE OFFICERS WHEN THEY GOT UPON THEIR FEET
NEVER MIND THE FIRE AND PINCERS MY GOOD BROTHERS IT WILL BE BEST TO TAKE THESE STRANGERS TO THE PRIVATE CITIZEN VERY WELL TUBEKINS RESPONDED A VOICE DEEP AND POWERFUL THAT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE AIR FOR THE SPEAKER WAS INVISIBLE ALL OUR FRIENDS GAVE A JUMP AT THIS
HOW COULD ANYONE BE SAFE WHEN SHE'S GOING ABOUT SIXTY MILES A MINUTE THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED BUT WHERE DO YOU S'POSE WE'RE GOING TO YOUR MAJ'STY DON'T ASK HER THAT PLEASE DON'T SAID SHAGGY WHO WAS NOT TOO FAR AWAY TO OVERHEAR THEM
EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL BE PATIENT AND YOU'LL FIND OUT MY DEAR SAID POLYCHROME BUT ISN'T THIS AN ODD EXPERIENCE HERE AM I WHOSE HOME IS IN THE SKIES MAKING A JOURNEY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
SAID COLONEL PLUM EAGERLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF BRAVERY AND ONE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO POSSESS THEM ALL
ROARED THE KING I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU KALIKO AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW I'LL TURN YOU INTO A POTATO AND MAKE SARATOGA CHIPS OF YOU THE NEXT TO CONSIDER HE ADDED MORE MILDLY IS THE SHAGGY MAN
BUT THE GENERALS NOW SHOUTED FORWARD AND BIND THE PRISONERS AND THE COLONELS AND MAJORS AND CAPTAINS REPEATED THE COMMAND YELLING IT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD ALL THIS NOISE ANNOYED HANK WHO HAD BEEN EYEING THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WITH STRONG DISFAVOR
AND EACH FLOWER HEAD WAS FIRMLY SET UPON ITS SLENDER BUT STOUT STEM THERE WERE EVEN A FEW WILD ROSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THESE THAT GAVE THE PRINCESS COURAGE TO ASK THE IMPORTANT QUESTION SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES FACING THE FLOWERS
THEY HAD BEGUN TO RECOVER THEIR WITS THIS IS AWFUL HANK CRIED BETSY IN A LOUD VOICE AND QUEEN ANN HEARD HER AND CALLED OUT
AND STAGGERED DOWN THE PATH BY THE WAY HE HAD COME THEY LET HIM DEPART IN SILENCE FOR WITH ALL HE HAD TAKEN THE MASSES OF JEWELS UPON THE GROUND
SO AFTER A TIME THEY ABANDONED THE CHASE AND RUGGEDO RETURNED TO HIS THRONE AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WITH A FINELY WOVEN HANDKERCHIEF OF CLOTH OF GOLD WELL SAID POLYCHROME WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO NOW
THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING HIM WHEN THEIR FELLOW ADVENTURERS REACHED THE SPOT GOODNESS GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU ALL
THE MULE WAS HEAVIER AND HAD BETSY CLINGING TO HIS BACK SO HE DID NOT GO SO HIGH UP FORTUNATELY FOR HIS LITTLE RIDER HE STRUCK THE GROUND UPON HIS FOUR FEET BETSY WAS JARRED A TRIFLE BUT NOT HURT
THERE IS BUT ONE SLIMY CAVE AND THERE IS NO ONE IN IT RETURNED PANG POSITIVELY RUGGEDO WAS BEGINNING TO BE ALARMED AS WELL AS ANGRY HOWEVER THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MADE HIM THE MORE VINDICTIVE
HE SAID AND THEN HIS COPPER JAWS CLICKED TOGETHER AND HE COULD SAY NO MORE HE NEXT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK BUT AFTER SEVERAL AWKWARD TRIALS FOUND HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS JOINTS PEALS OF JEERING LAUGHTER FROM PERSONS UNSEEN GREETED TIK TOK'S FAILURE
AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE SILENT FROM SYMPATHY I WAS SO ASHAMED OF MY LOOKS CONTINUED THE VOICE OF SHAGGY'S BROTHER THAT I TRIED TO HIDE BUT THE CRUEL KING RUGGEDO FORCED ME TO APPEAR BEFORE ALL THE LEGION OF NOMES TO WHOM HE SAID
AND THAT TIK TOK WOULD SOON BE MELTED IN A CRUCIBLE
BUT JUST THEN SHE RECEIVED A SHOVE THAT ALMOST PITCHED HER FORWARD ON HER HEAD SO SHE DECIDED TO GO THE OFFICERS WHO HESITATED RECEIVED SEVERAL ENERGETIC KICKS BUT COULD NOT SEE WHO DELIVERED THEM THEREFORE THEY ALSO DECIDED VERY WISELY TO GO
IN THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS OF OOGABOO A DOZEN OF WHOM WERE CLINGING TO THE OLD NOME AND HOLDING HIM FAST IN SPITE OF HIS EFFORTS TO ESCAPE THERE ALSO WAS QUEEN ANN LOOKING GRIMLY UPON THE SCENE OF STRIFE BUT WHEN SHE OBSERVED HER FORMER COMPANIONS APPROACHING
INSTEAD OF ENJOYING ALL THESE GLITTERY GOLDEN ONES ASKED BETSY BECAUSE HE FINDS FOOD AMONG THE NATURAL TREES REPLIED KALIKO AND I REMEMBER THAT HE HAS BUILT A LITTLE HOUSE THERE TO SLEEP IN AS FOR THESE GLITTERY GOLDEN TREES
THE MULE NOW DASHED FORWARD AND BEGAN BACKING UPON THE OFFICERS AND KICKING FIERCE AND DANGEROUS HEELS AT THEM THE ATTACK WAS SO SUDDEN THAT THE OFFICERS SCATTERED LIKE DUST IN A WHIRLWIND
HE CAME OUT OF HIS THRONE TO STAND BEFORE THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE WAVED HIS HANDS PALMS DOWNWARD IN SEVEN SEMICIRCLES OVER HIS VICTIM'S HEAD SAYING IN A LOW BUT CLEAR TONE OF VOICE THE MAGIC WUGWA
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME WHY EITHER WHY SAID BETSY NO ONE CAN TELL WHERE WE ARE GOING UNTIL WE GET THERE REPLIED SHAGGY AND THEN HE YELLED OUCH FOR POLYCHROME HAD OVERTAKEN HIM AND WAS NOW SITTING ON HIS HEAD
SAID GENERAL CONE MUSTERING COURAGE TO ADVANCE TO THE WELL BUT JUST THEN HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF TIK TOK AND SHAGGY AND AT ONCE FELL UPON HIS KNEES TREMBLING AND FRIGHTENED AND CRIED OUT
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IS BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR SPITE OR MALICE
RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
BUT FILES AND THE PRINCESS FOLLOWED ON AFTER SHAGGY DETERMINED NOT TO DESERT THEIR FRIEND AND HOPING THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ARISE TO RESCUE HIM AS FOR POLYCHROME
IN A MILD AND SYMPATHETIC TONE OF VOICE
QUITE SMOOTHLY AND HIS JOINTS WORKED FAIRLY WELL COME COMMANDED TUBEKINS AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WALKED UP THE PATH TOWARD THE CASTLE SHALL WE GO ASKED QUEEN ANN UNCERTAINLY
ALTHOUGH I MAY NEVER SEE YOUR FACE SO LET US MAKE THE MOST OF THIS JOYFUL REUNION THE UGLY ONE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS BY THIS TENDER SPEECH AND THE TEARS BEGAN TO WET THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
BY AND BY A NOISE SOUNDED FROM WITHIN THE HUT ARE YOU READY ASKED SHAGGY YES BROTHER CAME THE REPLY AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN TO ALLOW THE UGLY ONE TO STEP FORTH BETSY MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED ALOUD
AND CONVERSE MORE AT OUR EASE THE OFFICERS HAD BY THIS TIME RISEN FROM THEIR KNEES AND BRUSHED THE DUST FROM THEIR TROUSERS TO THEM THE ENEMY DID NOT LOOK VERY FIERCE SO THE GENERALS AND COLONELS AND MAJORS AND CAPTAINS GAINED COURAGE TO FACE THEM
SAID ANN SCORNFULLY A PRETTY LOT OF VAGABONDS YOU ARE INDEED ALL LOST OR STRAYED I SUPPOSE AND NOT WORTH A QUEEN'S PLUNDERING I'M SORRY I'VE CONQUERED YOU BUT YOU HAVEN'T CONQUERED US YET CALLED BETSY INDIGNANTLY
CLOSING THE ROCK ENTRANCE SO THAT I COULD NOT GET OUT I FOLLOWED THE LENGTH OF THE TUNNEL UNTIL I REACHED THIS HUGE DOME WHERE THE MARVELOUS METAL FOREST STANDS AND HERE I HAVE REMAINED EVER SINCE POOR BROTHER REPEATED SHAGGY
SAID TIK TOK PICKING UP THE GUN AND EXAMINING IT WONDERINGLY FOR HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A WEAPON THEN ANN STRAPPED THE KNAPSACK TO TIK TOK'S COPPER BACK AND SAID NOW WE ARE READY TO MARCH TO RUGGEDO'S KINGDOM AND CONQUER IT
HE COULD NOT GET THE LOVE MAGNET OUT OF HIS POCKET TRUE CRIED THE KING IN DELIGHT AT THIS EASY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM GET AT ONCE A DOZEN NOMES WITH ROPES AND PLACE THEM IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY CAN SEIZE AND BIND SHAGGY AS SOON AS HE ENTERS
I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN TO REPAY ME FOR ALL MY BOTHER REPLIED THE NOME KING THEN HE SAID TO KALIKO SUMMON THE EXECUTIONERS KALIKO AT ONCE WITHDREW AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A SCORE OF NOMES
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SO HELPLESS AND ALTOGETHER IN THE DARK AS TO THEIR FATE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVERSE AT ALL CHEERED THEM CONSIDERABLY
HAVE THE GOLD CRUCIBLE HEATED TO A WHITE SEETHING HEAT AND THEN WE'LL DUMP THE COPPER MAN INTO IT AND MELT HIM UP BUT YOUR MAJESTY PROTESTED KALIKO WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM AFTER SENDING A HUNDRED NOMES TO SEARCH FOR THE OOGABOO PEOPLE
AS HE OWNS THE LOVE MAGNET I THINK I'LL TRANSFORM HIM INTO A DOVE AND THEN WE CAN PRACTICE SHOOTING AT HIM WITH TIK TOK'S GUN
AT THAT TIME YOU HAD NO GUN SAID POLYCHROME
NOT FOR A SIN GLE SEC OND I CAN NOT FIGHT
AND RANGED BEFORE THE KING WERE THE ROSE PRINCESS FILES AND THE SHAGGY MAN TIK TOK STILL LAY UPON THE FLOOR WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE BIG DIAMOND RUGGEDO WAS NOW IN A MORE CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
IT WAS A LOVELY PLACE INDEED AND SEEMED TO BE THE GARDEN OF SOME GREAT PRINCE FOR THROUGH THE VISTAS OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY COULD BE SEEN THE TOWERS OF AN IMMENSE CASTLE BUT AS YET THE ONLY INHABITANT TO GREET THEM WAS THE PECULIAR PERSON JUST MENTIONED
TIK TOK IS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR PARTY FITTED TO UNDERTAKE THE JOB WHAT MUST I DO ASKED TIK TOK OBEY ORDERS REPLIED ANN WHEN THE OFFICERS COMMAND YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU MUST DO IT THAT IS ALL
AND THEY ARE NOT SO ELUSIVE I'LL HAVE FRESH DEWDROPS GATHERED FOR YOUR FEASTING EVERY DAY
KALIKO WENT AWAY LOOKING SAD AND DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THE KING WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ENOUGH TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT
INQUIRED MAJOR STOCKINGS IN AN ANXIOUS VOICE OF COURSE ANSWERED SHAGGY HE OWNS ALL THE METAL THAT LIES UNDERGROUND GOLD SILVER COPPER BRASS AND TIN
WELL REPLIED RUGGEDO I LIKE YOU THE OTHERS I HATE I HATE EVERYBODY BUT YOU WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO LIVE ALWAYS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CAVERN POLYCHROME SEE THE JEWELS THAT STUD THE WALLS HAVE EVERY TINT AND COLOR OF YOUR RAINBOW
RUBBING HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY TOGETHER ONE ENEMY IS OUT OF MY WAY AND NOW FOR THE OTHERS PERHAPS MY READERS SHOULD BE WARNED NOT TO ATTEMPT THE ABOVE TRANSFORMATION FOR
AND HE IS THE ONLY MAN GREAT ENOUGH FOR THE WORK PROTESTED THE REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES FLARING UP UNDER THE CALM SPECULATIVE GAZE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SOMEWHERE IN A CORRIDOR A DISTANT BELL TINKLED URGENTLY
TO ARTISTS POLITICIANS THINKERS REFORMERS OR SAINTS A DESPICABLE EMOTIONAL STATE THIS AGAINST WHICH SOLITUDE FORTIFIES A SUPERIOR CHARACTER AND WITH
HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS FACE RED HIS FINGERS HAD RUFFLED HIS HAIR INTO A DISSIPATED UNTIDINESS ALTOGETHER HE HAD A DISREPUTABLE ASPECT EXPRESSIVE OF THE DISCOMFORT THE IRRITATION
ENORMOUS HE STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG IN BIG ROOMY BOOTS AND UTTERED NO WORD OF GREETING
HE SMILED INNOCENTLY AT A TALL BRILLIANT GIRL WHOSE EYES MET HIS ACCIDENTALLY AND WENT OUT UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLANCES FOLLOWING HIM ACROSS THE ROOM
BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF FACES TROUBLED HIS INSPIRATION DEVELOPED IN SOLITUDE IN THAT CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE PATHETIC IN HIS GROTESQUE AND INCURABLE OBESITY WHICH HE HAD TO DRAG LIKE A GALLEY SLAVE'S BULLET TO THE END OF HIS DAYS
BUSY FISHING FOR HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE GOT IT FROM UNDER THE SOFA HE HELD IT AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE USE OF A HAT WELL HE'S WAITING FOR YOU SAID MISSUS VERLOC AT LAST I SAY ADOLF
PERVERSE INDEED BUT STILL AN INDUSTRY EXERCISED IN AN INDUSTRIOUS WORLD
FEW DAYS YOU COULDN'T DO BETTER THAN TAKE LODGINGS WITH MISTER GIUGLIANI CONTINENTAL HOTEL IT'S CALLED PRIVATE IT'S QUIET MY HUSBAND WILL TAKE YOU THERE A GOOD IDEA SAID THE THIN DARK MAN WHOSE GLANCE HAD HARDENED SUDDENLY
STEVIE OFFERED NO OBJECTION HE SEEMED RATHER EAGER IN A BEWILDERED SORT OF WAY HE TURNED HIS CANDID GAZE INQUISITIVELY TO MISTER VERLOC'S HEAVY COUNTENANCE AT FREQUENT INTERVALS ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS SISTER WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM
BUT IN TRUTH THERE IS A SORT OF LUCIDITY PROPER TO EXTRAVAGANT LANGUAGE AND THE GREAT MAN WAS NOT OFFENDED A SLIGHT JERKY MOVEMENT OF THE BIG BODY HALF LOST IN THE GLOOM OF THE GREEN SILK SHADES
AND THE CONVERSATION DROPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MISTER VLADIMIR TOOK LEAVE DIRECTLY HIS BACK WAS TURNED ON THE COUCH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROSE TOO
WHO LOOKED TO HIM UNCOMMONLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAS MADE A MESS OF HIS JOB BUT HIS CURIOSITY WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESTRAINED BY MERE COMPASSION HE COULD NOT HELP
SHE CONDEMNED IT FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW BUT HER ONLY REAL CONCERN WAS STEVIE'S WELFARE HE APPEARED TO HER THOUGHT IN THAT CONNECTION AS SUFFICIENTLY PECULIAR NOT TO BE TAKEN RASHLY ABROAD AND THAT WAS ALL
FAIR SLIGHT SLIGHT ENOUGH LOOK AT THAT FOOT THERE I PICKED UP THE LEGS FIRST
HE LEFT A WIFE AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN AND THE DEATH OF THAT MAN AROUSED THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF A REALM FOR WHOSE DEFENCE WELFARE AND GLORY MEN DIE EVERY DAY AS MATTER OF DUTY
WITH SOMBRE AVERSION WHEN URGED BY MISSUS VERLOC WHO SAID AT LAST AREN'T YOUR FEET WET YOU HAD BETTER PUT ON YOUR SLIPPERS YOU AREN'T GOING OUT ANY MORE THIS EVENING MISTER VERLOC INTIMATED BY MOROSE GRUNTS AND SIGNS THAT HIS FEET WERE NOT WET
THE DELICACY GUIDING HER CHOICE TO THE LEAST VALUABLE AND MOST DILAPIDATED ARTICLES PASSED UNACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE WINNIE'S PHILOSOPHY CONSISTED IN NOT TAKING NOTICE OF THE INSIDE OF FACTS
HAD BEEN LISTENING WITH PROFOUND ATTENTION
A SPY OF THAT SORT CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE RECKLESS THAN THE MOST RECKLESS OF CONSPIRATORS HIS OCCUPATION IS FREE FROM ALL RESTRAINT HE'S WITHOUT AS MUCH FAITH AS IS NECESSARY FOR COMPLETE NEGATION AND WITHOUT THAT MUCH LAW AS IS IMPLIED IN LAWLESSNESS
TO DESTROY PUBLIC FAITH IN LEGALITY WAS THE IMPERFECT FORMULA OF HIS PEDANTIC FANATICISM BUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS CONVICTION THAT THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESTABLISHED SOCIAL ORDER CANNOT BE EFFECTUALLY SHATTERED
HIS POSITION HAD TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE CLAIMS OF LEGAL JUSTICE AND EVEN THE PROMPTINGS OF PARTIALITY THE POSSESSION OF THE FURNITURE WOULD NOT BE IN ANY SENSE A PROVISION HE OUGHT TO HAVE IT THE POOR BOY
THE CRAWLING APPROACH OF A HANSOM HE GAVE NO SIGN BUT WHEN THE LOW STEP GLIDING ALONG THE CURBSTONE CAME TO HIS FEET HE DODGED IN SKILFULLY IN FRONT OF THE BIG TURNING WHEEL AND SPOKE UP THROUGH THE LITTLE TRAP DOOR
AND IF MISTER VERLOC THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT HIS WIFE'S BROTHER LOOKED UNCOMMONLY USELESS IT WAS ONLY A DULL AND FLEETING THOUGHT DEVOID OF THAT FORCE AND DURABILITY WHICH ENABLES SOMETIMES A THOUGHT TO MOVE THE WORLD LEANING BACK
THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH AND ESTABLISHES A SORT OF AMENITY IN THEIR RELATIONS PRODUCTS OF THE SAME MACHINE ONE CLASSED AS USEFUL AND THE OTHER AS NOXIOUS THEY TAKE THE MACHINE FOR GRANTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
IT MADE HER UNEASY IT MADE HER NERVOUS SHE CONFESSED AND THAT FROM THE CALM WINNIE SOUNDED LIKE EXAGGERATION BUT IN TRUTH
PEEPED IN TO SEE THAT THE CONTENTS WERE ALL RIGHT AND PUT IT DOWN GENTLY ON THE COUNTER NOT TILL THAT WAS DONE DID HE BREAK THE SILENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT MOST LIKELY STEVIE WOULD PROFIT GREATLY BY BEING SENT OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE
IT ONLY EXCITED THE POOR BOY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP THEM BEING SO
AN INVINCIBLE AND HUMANITARIAN CREED WHICH HE CONFESSED RATHER THAN PREACHED WITH AN OBSTINATE GENTLENESS A SMILE OF PACIFIC ASSURANCE ON HIS LIPS AND HIS CANDID BLUE EYES CAST DOWN
A DEPARTMENT IS TO THOSE IT EMPLOYS A COMPLEX PERSONALITY WITH IDEAS AND EVEN FADS OF ITS OWN IT DEPENDS ON THE LOYAL DEVOTION OF ITS SERVANTS
IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL ANOTHER WATERPROOF SHEET WAS SPREAD OVER THAT TABLE IN THE MANNER OF A TABLE CLOTH WITH THE CORNERS TURNED UP OVER A SORT OF MOUND A HEAP OF RAGS SCORCHED AND BLOODSTAINED
A SQUARE BACKED BLACK MONSTER BLOCKING HALF THE STREET WITH SUDDEN IRON SHOD STAMPINGS FIERCE JINGLES AND HEAVY BLOWING SIGHS THE HARSHLY FESTIVE ILL OMENED GLARE OF A LARGE AND PROSPEROUS PUBLIC HOUSE FACED THE OTHER END OF BRETT STREET ACROSS A WIDE ROAD
THE COLOUR OF RIPE CORN FRAMED WITH THEIR POINTS THE SQUARE BLOCK OF HIS SHAVED CHIN
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I AM AFTER IS MORE LIKE A DOG FISH YOU DON'T KNOW PERHAPS WHAT A DOG FISH IS LIKE YES I DO WE'RE BURIED IN SPECIAL BOOKS UP TO OUR NECKS WHOLE SHELVES FULL OF THEM WITH PLATES
MISSUS VERLOC ROSE AND WALKING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE SAID IN THE FULNESS OF HER HEART AND YOU ARE NOT TIRED OF ME MISTER VERLOC MADE NO SOUND
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER KNEW THE LADY YOU DO NOT LOOK FRIGHTENED HE PRONOUNCED AFTER SURVEYING HER CONSCIENTIOUSLY WITH HIS TIRED AND EQUABLE GAZE HE WAS THINKING MEANTIME TO HIMSELF THAT IN THIS HOUSE
SHE WENT ROUND THE CORNER TO DRINK ARDENT SPIRITS IN A MEAN AND MUSTY PUBLIC HOUSE THE UNAVOIDABLE STATION ON THE VIA DOLOROSA OF HER LIFE MISSUS VERLOC'S COMMENT UPON THIS PRACTICE
HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY CURIOUS BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VINDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS DEPARTMENT
HE'S BEEN FRIGHTENING ME DECLARED SUDDENLY THE LADY WHO SAT BY THE SIDE OF MISTER VLADIMIR
WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A QUIVER STIRRING THE WHITE THONGS OF THEIR BIG WHIPS MISTER VLADIMIR WALKED ON AND THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN FELL INTO STEP AT HIS ELBOW HE SAID NOTHING
WHICH DEFIES TIME WITH SCORNFUL DISREGARD AS IF IT WERE A RATHER VULGAR CONVENTION SUBMITTED TO BY THE MASS OF INFERIOR MANKIND MANY OTHER CONVENTIONS EASIER TO SET ASIDE ALAS FAILED TO OBTAIN HER RECOGNITION
SHE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE BIG ONE BUT THE OTHER WAS A FAIR SLIGHT CHAP CARRYING A TIN VARNISH CAN IN ONE HAND THE CONSTABLE CEASED KNOW THE WOMAN MUTTERED THE CHIEF INSPECTOR
GREW UPON HER HEARING BIZARRE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE IT ARRESTED MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION THEN AS ITS CHARACTER BECAME PLAIN TO THE EAR SHE STOPPED SHORT AMAZED AND CONCERNED
SO THIS INSTRUCTIVE CRIME WAS PLANNED ABROAD MISTER VLADIMIR SAID QUICKLY YOU ADMIT IT WAS PLANNED ABROAD THEORETICALLY THEORETICALLY ONLY ON FOREIGN TERRITORY ABROAD ONLY BY A FICTION SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
HAD SOLD SOME WARES HAD SEEN MISTER MICHAELIS SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD TOLD HER THE LAST TIME THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY TO LIVE IN A COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE ON THE LONDON CHATHAM AND DOVER LINE KARL YUNDT
THAT IS IN A CERTAIN SHOP IN BRETT STREET AND ON THE LIPS OF A CERTAIN SECRET AGENT ONCE UPON A TIME THE CONFIDENTIAL AND TRUSTED SPY
AND IN THEIR OWN WAY THE MOST ARDENT OF REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PERHAPS DOING NO MORE BUT SEEKING FOR PEACE IN COMMON WITH THE REST OF MANKIND THE PEACE OF SOOTHED VANITY OF SATISFIED APPETITES
AFTER THIS PROFOUND OBSERVATION THE EXPERIENCED TOODLES SEEMED TO REFLECT AT ANY RATE HE SAID NOTHING FOR QUITE TWO SECONDS THEN I'M GLAD
HE THOUGHT I'LL GET A LITTLE WET A LITTLE SPLASHED HE BECAME AWARE OF THE WAITER AT HIS ELBOW AND OF A SMALL PILE OF SILVER COINS ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THE WAITER KEPT ONE EYE ON IT
HE WAS SATISFIED BY THE SUBTLE MODIFICATION
HIS PART WITH A FEW OTHERS BEING TO FORCE OPEN THE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE SPECIAL CONVEYANCE WHEN ARRESTED HE HAD A BUNCH OF SKELETON KEYS IN ONE POCKET A HEAVY CHISEL IN ANOTHER AND A SHORT CROWBAR IN HIS HAND
I SHOULD LAY IT DOWN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF SECRET AGENTS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AS TENDING TO AUGMENT THE POSITIVE DANGERS OF THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH THEY ARE USED THAT THE SPY WILL FABRICATE HIS INFORMATION IS A MERE COMMONPLACE BUT IN THE SPHERE OF
AND CHARLATANS OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS WHO UNSUBSTANTIAL AND LIGHT BOBBING UP LIKE CORKS SHOW BEST THE DIRECTION OF THE SURFACE CURRENTS
WINNIE LEANED ON HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND AND PRESSED HER LIPS TO HIS FOREHEAD THUS SHE LINGERED NOT A WHISPER REACHED THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE PAVEMENT DIED OUT IN THE DISCREET DIMNESS OF THE SHOP
LET ESCAPE ON THE PAVEMENT A NARROW CLEAR STREAK OF GAS LIGHT WITHIN BEHIND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE VAN AND HORSES MERGED INTO ONE MASS SEEMED SOMETHING ALIVE
STOOD OBSERVING IT ACROSS THE ROADWAY THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE BY THE SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDOW ENCUMBERED BY THE SHADOWS OF NONDESCRIPT THINGS THE DOOR STANDING AJAR
NOT WANTED I TELL YOU HE REPEATED THE ANARCHIST DID NOT STIR AN INWARD LAUGH OF DERISION UNCOVERED NOT ONLY HIS TEETH BUT HIS GUMS AS WELL
WHAT PLEASED ME MOST IN THIS AFFAIR THE ASSISTANT WENT ON TALKING SLOWLY
YES YES I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT HE DREW OUT OF HIS BREAST POCKET A NEW PIGSKIN POCKET BOOK MISSUS VERLOC RECEIVED IT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND STOOD STILL TILL THE BELL
PROPPED UP ON HIS TWO ARMS AS THOUGH HE WERE FEELING GIDDY OR SICK SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ADOLF SHE CALLED OUT HALF ALOUD AND WHEN HE HAD RAISED HIMSELF DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN SHE ASKED RAPIDLY I'VE HEARD OF HIM
WHO WAS GOOD AND OF HIS TRULY PECULIAR DUMBNESS WHICH IN THE OLD AFFAIR OF FIREWORKS ON THE STAIRS HAD FOR MANY YEARS RESISTED ENTREATIES COAXING ANGER AND OTHER MEANS OF INVESTIGATION USED BY HIS BELOVED SISTER
AND SPEAKING WITH A WEAK SELF CONFIDENT VOICE TO THE VIGOROUS TENACIOUS VITALITY OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR THE PHYSICAL WRETCHEDNESS OF THAT BEING
HE HAS LOST THE SKILL NECESSARY FOR HIS MANUAL OCCUPATION HE TOLD ME ALL THIS HIMSELF WITH THE SWEETEST PATIENCE BUT THEN HE SAID
INSTANTANEOUS HE REMEMBERED ALL HE HAD EVER READ IN POPULAR PUBLICATIONS OF LONG AND TERRIFYING DREAMS DREAMED IN THE INSTANT OF WAKING
MISSUS VERLOC WAS STARTLED YOU'VE BEEN GETTING WET SHE SAID NOT VERY MISTER VERLOC MANAGED TO FALTER OUT IN A PROFOUND SHUDDER BY A GREAT EFFORT HE SUPPRESSED THE RATTLING OF HIS TEETH
AND BRINGING IN HER BROTHER STEVIE AS SOON AS SHE COULD INTO THE CURRENT OF DOMESTIC EVENTS SHE MENTIONED THAT THE BOY HAD MOPED A GOOD DEAL IT'S ALL ALONG OF MOTHER LEAVING US LIKE THIS MISTER VERLOC NEITHER SAID DAMN
SOMEWHERE OUT OF THAT A DIVISION ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER CAREFULLY MADE MIGHT GIVE SOME CAUSE OF OFFENCE TO WINNIE NO STEVIE MUST REMAIN DESTITUTE AND DEPENDENT
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET ANOTHER SUSPECT PATCH OF DIM LIGHT ISSUED FROM MISTER VERLOC'S SHOP FRONT HUNG WITH PAPERS HEAVING WITH VAGUE PILES OF CARDBOARD BOXES AND THE SHAPES OF BOOKS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
WHOSE SYMMETRICALLY ARRANGED HAIR GAVE HIM THE AIR OF A LARGE AND NEAT SCHOOLBOY MET THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REQUEST WITH A DOUBTFUL LOOK AND SPOKE WITH BATED BREATH WOULD HE SEE YOU
HE NODDED THAT WILL DO AND SITTING STILL WITH HIS HAT PUSHED OFF HIS FOREHEAD
THE INDIGNATION OF THIS MAN VERLOC HAD LEFT NOTHING IN DOUBT NOTHING WHATEVER HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS MIND ALMOST BY AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE
YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING A MESS OF IT
TACITURN STILL HE WAS NOT SO LISTLESS MISSUS VERLOC THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RATHER JUMPY AT TIMES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN IMPROVEMENT AS TO STEVIE HE MOPED NO LONGER AT THE FOOT OF THE CLOCK BUT MUTTERED TO HIMSELF IN CORNERS INSTEAD
AT THE NAME OF THAT EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE CLUB TOODLES LOOKED SCARED AND STOPPED SHORT NONSENSE HE PROTESTED BUT IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MEMBER
THE GREAT MAN MANIFESTED NO SURPRISE NO EAGERNESS NO SENTIMENT WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE RESTED HIS MENACED EYES WAS PROFOUNDLY MEDITATIVE HE DID NOT ALTER IT THE LEAST BIT
NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE FACT REMAINS THE ADDRESS ON HIS CLOTHING DISCOVERED BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT TOO IT IS AN INCREDIBLE LITTLE FACT SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE EXPLANATION WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT IS BOUND TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
CHAPTER TEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DRIVEN RAPIDLY IN A HANSOM FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SOHO IN THE DIRECTION OF WESTMINSTER GOT OUT AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS
AN AMUSED SMILE I WAS REALLY THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER AT THIS STAGE FOR HEAT TO BE REPLACED BY WHAT HEAT
HE FOLLOWED HIS WIFE'S MOVEMENTS WITH HIS EYES MISSUS VERLOC WENT ABOUT SERENELY CLEARING UP THE TABLE HER TRANQUIL VOICE COMMENTED THE IDEA THROWN OUT IN A REASONABLE AND DOMESTIC TONE IT WOULDN'T STAND EXAMINATION
IT WAS BY NO MEANS GROUNDLESS AND YET THIS EPISODE HAPPENS I CALL IT AN EPISODE BECAUSE THIS AFFAIR I MAKE BOLD TO SAY IS EPISODIC IT IS NO PART OF ANY GENERAL SCHEME HOWEVER WILD
THEY'LL HAVE TO GET A HARD RAP ON THE KNUCKLES OVER THIS AFFAIR WE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO WHAT IS YOUR GENERAL IDEA STATED SHORTLY NO NEED TO GO INTO DETAILS NO SIR ETHELRED IN PRINCIPLE
AND SHE FOLLOWED IT WITH THE EVERLASTING PLAINT OF THE POOR PATHETICALLY MENDACIOUS MISERABLY AUTHENTICATED BY THE HORRIBLE BREATH OF CHEAP RUM AND SOAP SUDS SHE SCRUBBED HARD SNUFFLING ALL THE TIME AND TALKING VOLUBLY
OF A RAGING IMPLACABLE PITY FOR THE VICTIM THREE RING LEADERS GOT HANGED MICHAELIS YOUNG AND SLIM LOCKSMITH BY TRADE AND GREAT FREQUENTER OF EVENING SCHOOLS DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT ANYBODY HAD BEEN KILLED
MISTER VLADIMIR AFFECTING NOT TO LISTEN LEANED TOWARDS THE COUCH TALKING AMIABLY IN SUBDUED TONES BUT HE HEARD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SAY I'VE NO DOUBT THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HAS A VERY PRECISE NOTION OF THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AFFAIR
I WOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED YOU BOWED UNDER THE OVERMANTEL MISTER VERLOC HOLDING HIS HEAD IN BOTH HANDS SEEMED TO HAVE GONE TO SLEEP
THE UNPAID SECRETARY ADMIRED THIS PLUCK COMPOSING FOR HIMSELF AN INNOCENT FACE HE OPENED A DOOR AND WENT IN WITH THE ASSURANCE OF A NICE AND PRIVILEGED CHILD AND PRESENTLY HE REAPPEARED
YES A GENUINE WIFE AND THE VICTIM WAS A GENUINE BROTHER IN LAW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A DOMESTIC DRAMA THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LAUGHED A LITTLE BUT THE GREAT MAN'S THOUGHTS SEEMED TO HAVE WANDERED FAR AWAY
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN SHAMBLES AND RAG SHOPS YOU USED A SHOVEL HE REMARKED OBSERVING A SPRINKLING OF SMALL GRAVEL TINY BROWN BITS OF BARK
AS IS PLAIN TO ME FROM THE PRESENT MISERABLE STATE OF MILITARY ARCHITECTURE AMONGST THEM
O JONATHAN TWOULD MAKE A GOOD NATURED MAN'S HEART BLEED TO CONSIDER CONTINUED THE CORPORAL STANDING PERPENDICULARLY HOW LOW MANY A BRAVE AND UPRIGHT FELLOW HAS BEEN LAID SINCE THAT TIME AND TRUST ME SUSY ADDED THE CORPORAL TURNING TO SUSANNAH
THERE WAS AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO TELL THEE TRULY TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY ANY OTHER DATE WOULD HAVE PLEASED ME MUCH BETTER NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAD STAIN UPON OUR HISTORY THAT YEAR
UNLESS IT WAS IN MY POWER WHICH IT IS NOT TO INCREASE THEIR MEASURE BROTHER SHANDY ANSWERED MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING WISTFULLY IN HIS FACE YOU ARE MUCH MISTAKEN IN THIS POINT
SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
SO THAT WHEN AN ATTACK WAS RESOLVED UPON MISSUS WADMAN HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WHEN SHE HAD GOT ADVANCED TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX BUT TO EXTEND HER RIGHT HAND
BECAUSE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE DON PEDRO THE BISHOP OF LEON HOW CAME PRIESTS AND BISHOPS AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS SO MUCH ABOUT GUN POWDER GOD KNOWS SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
HAVE DONE FOR ME IN THAT RESPECT OR DISCREDIT THE OTHER HELPS OF AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATION BESTOWED UPON ME BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD SINCE YET I OFTEN THINK THAT I OWE ONE HALF OF MY PHILANTHROPY TO THAT ONE ACCIDENTAL IMPRESSION
AT THE END OF HIS DIVINE ART OF MEDITATION IMPRINTED AT LONDON
BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
THEIR POLICY AND EVEN THEIR RELIGION IS IT ELSE TO BE CONCEIVED CORPORAL CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY RISING UP IN HIS SENTRY BOX AS HE BEGAN TO WARM IN THIS PART OF HIS DISCOURSE HOW MARLBOROUGH COULD HAVE MARCHED HIS ARMY FROM THE BANKS OF THE MAES TO BELBURG FROM BELBURG TO KERPENORD
WHICH HAVING LITTLE OR NO MEANING IN THEM NATURE IS OFT TIMES OBLIGED TO FIND ONE AND AS FOR MY FATHER'S EXAMPLE TWAS SO FAR FROM BEING EITHER AIDING OR ABETTING THEREUNTO
AND THEN RETURNING PALE AS ASHES TO THE DOOR TO TAKE HIS MOURNING HORSE BY THE BRIDLE TO FOLLOW HIS HEARSE AS HE DIRECTED THEE WHERE
YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
AND LAST OF ALL BECAUSE THE HARDEST OF ALL LET US LEAVE IF POSSIBLE MYSELF BUT TIS IMPOSSIBLE I MUST GO ALONG WITH YOU TO THE END OF THE WORK
I KNOW NO MAN UNDER WHOSE ARM I WOULD HAVE SOONER TAKEN SHELTER NOR DID THIS ARISE FROM ANY INSENSIBILITY OR OBTUSENESS OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PARTS FOR HE FELT THIS INSULT OF MY FATHER'S AS FEELINGLY AS A MAN COULD DO
THE MONTERO CAP I SHALL DESCRIBE BY AND BYE THE TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES HAD NOTHING PARTICULAR IN THEM THEY WERE FITTED UP AND ORNAMENTED AS USUAL WITH FLEXIBLE TUBES OF MOROCCO LEATHER AND GOLD WIRE
BY SAINT PETER'S GIRDLE I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SWISS CRIED FRANCIS THE FIRST PULLING UP HIS BREECHES AND WALKING HASTILY ACROSS THE FLOOR YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE MINISTER CALMLY CANNOT BRING YOURSELF OFF WE'LL PAY THEM IN MONEY SAID THE KING
BY A DECREE FAST BOUND DOWN IN IRON HAD BEEN DESTINED SHE GAVE A NOD TO NATURE
WHICH BRINGS ABOUT THE YEAR AND CONSTITUTES THAT VARIETY AND VICISSITUDE OF SEASONS WE ENJOY THOUGH I OWN IT SUGGESTED THE THOUGHT AS I BELIEVE THE GREATEST OF OUR
AND THAT THESE UNPROVOKED STROKES AT MY UNCLE TOBY'S COULD NOT BE UNFELT BY HIM NO AS I SAID ABOVE MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEEL THEM AND VERY SENSIBLY TOO
AND DIDIUS HAS SO PRESSINGLY INVITED YOU WHO IN YOUR DISTRESS WOULD MISS SUCH AN OCCASION ALL THAT IS REQUISITE CONTINUED YORICK IS TO APPRIZE DIDIUS AND LET HIM MANAGE A CONVERSATION AFTER DINNER SO AS TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT
OF CLEAR GLASS BATING THE UMBILICAL KNOT SO THAT TILL THE INHABITANTS GROW OLD AND TOLERABLY WRINKLED WHEREBY THE RAYS OF LIGHT IN PASSING THROUGH THEM BECOME SO MONSTROUSLY REFRACTED
THIS IS TO SERVE FOR PARENTS AND GOVERNORS INSTEAD OF A WHOLE VOLUME UPON THE SUBJECT I COULD NOT GIVE THE READER THIS STROKE IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S PICTURE BY THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH I DREW THE OTHER PARTS OF IT
FOR THAT THE TAYLOR IN RIPPING THEM UP IN ORDER TO TURN THEM HAD FOUND THEY HAD BEEN TURN'D BEFORE THEN TURN THEM AGAIN BROTHER SAID MY FATHER RAPIDLY FOR THERE WILL BE MANY A TURNING OF EM YET BEFORE ALL'S DONE IN THE AFFAIR
THEN WHEELING ABOUT AND CHARGING CONTI AT THE HEAD OF IT BRAVE BRAVE BY HEAVEN CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY HE DESERVES A CROWN AS RICHLY AS A THIEF A HALTER SHOUTED TRIM MY UNCLE TOBY KNEW THE CORPORAL'S LOYALTY
LET NO MAN WHO HAS READ MY FATHER'S FIRST AND SECOND BEDS OF JUSTICE EVER RISE UP AND SAY AGAIN FROM COLLISION OF WHAT KINDS OF BODIES LIGHT MAY OR MAY NOT BE STRUCK OUT TO CARRY THE ARTS AND SCIENCES UP TO PERFECTION HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST HOW I LOVE THEM
MY UNCLE TOBY WAS A MAN PATIENT OF INJURIES NOT FROM WANT OF COURAGE I HAVE TOLD YOU IN A FORMER CHAPTER THAT HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE AND WILL ADD HERE THAT WHERE JUST OCCASIONS PRESENTED OR CALLED IT FORTH
IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
NATURE THREW HALF A SPADE FULL OF HER KINDLIEST COMPOST UPON IT WITH JUST SO MUCH CLAY IN IT AS TO RETAIN THE FORMS OF ANGLES AND INDENTINGS AND SO LITTLE OF IT TOO AS NOT TO CLING TO THE SPADE AND RENDER WORKS OF SO MUCH GLORY NASTY IN FOUL WEATHER
WHEN MY AUNT DINAH AND THE COACHMAN CAME ACROSS US AND LED US A VAGARY SOME MILLIONS OF MILES INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS YOU PERCEIVE THAT
OR TOO INQUISITIVE IN KNOWING WHAT GREAT MAN WAS THE DISCOVERER AND WHAT OCCASIONS GAVE BIRTH TO IT I AM FAR FROM CONTROVERTING CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY WHAT HISTORIANS AGREE IN THAT IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD THIRTEEN EIGHTY
AND TEAR THE LAUREL FROM LUXEMBOURG'S BROWS IF YET TIS POSSIBLE I SEE HIM WITH THE KNOT OF HIS SCARFE JUST SHOT OFF INFUSING FRESH SPIRITS INTO POOR GALWAY'S REGIMENT RIDING ALONG THE LINE
SAID SUSANNAH HE IS A KINDLY HEARTED GENTLEMAN SAID OBADIAH AS EVER LIVED AYE AND AS BRAVE A ONE TOO SAID THE CORPORAL AS EVER STEPT BEFORE A PLATOON THERE NEVER WAS A BETTER OFFICER IN THE KING'S ARMY OR A BETTER MAN IN GOD'S WORLD FOR HE WOULD MARCH UP TO THE MOUTH OF A CANNON
IN THE SECOND YEAR IN WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK LIEGE AND RUREMOND HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT AFFORD THE EXPENCE OF FOUR HANDSOME DRAW BRIDGES OF TWO OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN AN EXACT DESCRIPTION IN THE FORMER PART OF MY WORK
QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING HIM AS HE MENTIONED THE BLIND GUT IN A DISCOURSE WITH MY FATHER THE NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF ME I BESEECH YOU QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY TO TELL ME WHICH IS THE BLIND GUT FOR OLD AS I AM I VOW I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHERE IT LIES
WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER TRINKETS SMALL IN THEMSELVES BUT OF GREAT REGARD WHICH POOR TOM THE CORPORAL'S UNFORTUNATE BROTHER HAD SENT HIM OVER WITH THE ACCOUNT OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH THE JEW'S WIDOW THERE WAS A MONTERO CAP AND TWO TURKISH TOBACCO PIPES
LEAVE OUT THE DATE ENTIRELY TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LEANING FORWARDS AND LAYING HIS HAND GENTLY UPON THE CORPORAL'S SHOULDER TO TEMPER THE INTERRUPTION LEAVE IT OUT ENTIRELY TRIM A STORY PASSES VERY WELL WITHOUT THESE NICETIES
SO THAT IT WAS NOON THE NEXT DAY CONTINUED THE CORPORAL BEFORE I WAS EXCHANGED AND PUT INTO A CART WITH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN MORE IN ORDER TO BE CONVEY'D TO OUR HOSPITAL
ATTUNED BY MERCY MIGHT FIND A PASSAGE TO MY HEART I KNOW NOT THIS I KNOW THAT THE LESSON OF UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL THEN TAUGHT AND IMPRINTED BY MY UNCLE TOBY HAS NEVER SINCE BEEN WORN OUT OF MY MIND
WHICH IN THE FORMER PART OF MY WORK I PROMISED AND FULLY INTENDED TO PAY OFF THIS YEAR BUT SOME OF YOUR WORSHIPS AND REVERENCES TELLING ME THAT THE TWO SUBJECTS ESPECIALLY SO CONNECTED TOGETHER MIGHT ENDANGER THE MORALS OF THE WORLD
BUT IN HIS IMAGINATION FOR I AM SURE I GAVE HIM SO MINUTE A DESCRIPTION I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED OF IT WHEN FATE WAS LOOKING FORWARDS ONE AFTERNOON INTO THE GREAT TRANSACTIONS OF FUTURE TIMES AND RECOLLECTED FOR WHAT PURPOSES THIS LITTLE PLOT
NOW TRIM'S MONTERO CAP AS I ONCE TOLD YOU WAS HIS CONSTANT WAGER AND HAVING FURBISH'D IT UP THAT VERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO GO UPON THE ATTACK IT MADE THE ODDS LOOK MORE CONSIDERABLE
WHOSE EYES WERE SWIMMING IN WATER BEFORE THAT TIME COMES ROUND AGAIN
IN WHICH A PRACTICABLE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE BY THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH
LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
A BEND SINISTER BY SOME OF THESE FATALITIES HAD BEEN DRAWN QUITE ACROSS THE FIELD OF THE SHANDY ARMS TIS SCARCE CREDIBLE THAT THE MIND OF SO WISE A MAN AS MY FATHER WAS COULD BE SO MUCH INCOMMODED WITH SO SMALL A MATTER THE WORD COACH LET IT BE WHOSE IT WOULD
I SHOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THIS METHOD BUT THAT I THINK IT MUST SMELL TOO STRONG OF THE LAMP AND BE RENDER'D STILL MORE OPEROSE
I OWN IT THAT FROM WHITSONTIDE TO WITHIN THREE WEEKS OF CHRISTMAS
THEY ALL LOOKED DIRECTLY AT THE SCULLION THE SCULLION HAD JUST BEEN SCOURING A FISH KETTLE IT WAS NOT FAIR WHAT IS THE FINEST FACE THAT EVER MAN LOOKED AT I COULD HEAR TRIM TALK SO FOR EVER CRIED SUSANNAH WHAT IS IT
MY UNCLE TOBY THINKING A TOWN LOOKED FOOLISHLY WITHOUT A CHURCH ADDED A VERY FINE ONE WITH A STEEPLE TRIM WAS FOR HAVING BELLS IN IT MY UNCLE TOBY SAID THE METAL HAD BETTER BE CAST INTO CANNON THIS
BUT NEVER THINK OF MAKING A DRAWING BY IT THIS IS AENIGMATICAL AND INTENDED TO BE SO AT LEAST AD POPULUM
AS ALWAYS FALLS OUT WHEN A MAN IS IN THE MOST HASTE
WHICH MIGHT HAPPEN OR NOT JUST AS CHANCE ORDERED IT KING WILLIAM WAS OF AN OPINION AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR QUOTH TRIM THAT EVERY THING WAS PREDESTINED FOR US IN THIS WORLD
THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
RISING UP BY MY FATHER'S HELP SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME HAD IT BEEN TEN TIMES AS MUCH BROTHER
AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
HE HAD A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND QUICK SENSIBILITY OF NATURE ATTENDED WITH A LITTLE SORENESS OF TEMPER THO THIS NEVER TRANSPORTED HIM TO ANY THING WHICH LOOKED LIKE MALIGNANCY
SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
WAS SCARLET OF A SUPERFINE SPANISH CLOTH DYED IN GRAIN AND MOUNTED ALL ROUND WITH FUR EXCEPT ABOUT FOUR INCHES IN THE FRONT WHICH WAS FACED WITH A LIGHT BLUE SLIGHTLY EMBROIDERED
A HALF MOON LIKEWISE IS A HALF MOON AND NO MORE SO LONG AS IT STANDS BEFORE ITS BASTION BUT WAS IT TO CHANGE PLACE AND GET BEFORE THE CURTIN
TIS OF ABSOLUTE USE TO HIM HE MUST BE ACQUAINTED INTIMATELY WITH EVERY COUNTRY AND ITS BOUNDARIES WHERE HIS PROFESSION CARRIES HIM HE SHOULD KNOW EVERY TOWN AND CITY AND VILLAGE AND HAMLET WITH THE CANALS THE ROADS AND HOLLOW WAYS WHICH LEAD UP TO THEM
THEN JACK'S NO WORSE NEVER MIND WHICH WE PASS ON IN HOT PURSUIT THE WOUND ITSELF WHICH BRINGS HIM IS NOT FELT THE BEST WAY IS TO STAND UP TO HIM THE MAN WHO FLIES IS IN TEN TIMES MORE DANGER THAN THE MAN WHO MARCHES UP INTO HIS JAWS
LUSATIA AND UPPER SAXONY TO THE NORTH FRANCONIA TO THE WEST AND BAVARIA TO THE SOUTH BOHEMIA COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROPELL'D TO THE SEA WITHOUT CEASING TO BE BOHEMIA NOR COULD THE SEA ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE COME UP TO BOHEMIA WITHOUT OVERFLOWING A GREAT PART OF GERMANY
AND FORBIDS THE APPETITE TO FAIL ALL THE DEXTERITY IS IN THE GOOD COOKERY AND MANAGEMENT OF THEM SO AS TO BE NOT ONLY FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE READER BUT ALSO OF THE AUTHOR
THERE IS BUT ONE AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR
WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM MY MOTHER WAS THEN CONJUGALLY SWINGING WITH HER LEFT ARM TWISTED UNDER HIS RIGHT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE INSIDE OF HER HAND RESTED UPON THE BACK OF HIS
AND MAKING A VOW AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WAS THE LAST TIME HE WOULD EVER SET HIS FOOT IN IT AGAIN TILL THE BEND SINISTER WAS TAKEN OUT BUT LIKE THE AFFAIR OF THE HINGE IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY THINGS WHICH THE DESTINIES HAD SET DOWN IN THEIR BOOKS EVER TO BE GRUMBLED AT AND IN WISER FAMILIES THAN OURS BUT NEVER TO BE MENDED
LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
I THINK QUOTH MY FATHER THAT THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF DEFENCE HAS ITS WEAK SIDES AS WELL AS OTHERS AS FOR THE HORN WORK HIGH HO SIGH'D MY FATHER WHICH CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY MY BROTHER WAS SPEAKING OF
FROM THAT OF THE EARTH'S MOVING ROUND HER AXIS
WHEN UPON HIS TAKING AMBERG BONN AND RHINBERG AND HUY AND LIMBOURG ONE AFTER ANOTHER A THOUGHT CAME INTO THE CORPORAL'S HEAD THAT TO TALK OF TAKING SO MANY TOWNS WITHOUT ONE TOWN TO SHEW FOR IT WAS A VERY NONSENSICAL WAY OF GOING TO WORK
AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
THAT BED CURTAINS IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE TAKEN THEIR NAME FROM THEM NOR HAVE THE HORN WORKS HE SPEAKS OF ANY THING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH THE HORN WORKS OF CUCKOLDOM BUT THE CURTIN SIR IS THE WORD WE USE IN FORTIFICATION
IT SHALL BE DONE IN TWO MINUTES AMONGST MANY OTHER BOOK DEBTS ALL OF WHICH I SHALL DISCHARGE IN DUE TIME I OWN MYSELF A DEBTOR TO THE WORLD FOR TWO ITEMS A CHAPTER UPON CHAMBER MAIDS AND BUTTON HOLES
INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
NOR SHALL MY PENCIL BE GUIDED BY ANY ONE WIND INSTRUMENT WHICH EVER WAS BLOWN UPON EITHER ON THIS
IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS SOUL WOULD LAY HIS HAND FLAT UPON IT IN ORDER TO GO ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION AND MISSUS WADMAN BY A MANOEUVRE AS QUICK AS THOUGHT WOULD AS CERTAINLY PLACE HER'S CLOSE BESIDE IT THIS AT ONCE OPENED A COMMUNICATION
TREATED HIMSELF WITH A HANDSOME SENTRY BOX TO STAND AT THE CORNER OF THE BOWLING GREEN BETWIXT WHICH POINT AND THE FOOT OF THE GLACIS THERE WAS LEFT A LITTLE KIND OF AN ESPLANADE FOR HIM AND THE CORPORAL TO CONFER AND HOLD COUNCILS OF WAR UPON THE SENTRY BOX WAS IN CASE OF RAIN
AND THAT I HAVE NOT LEFT A SINGLE INCH FOR IT FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INCROACHING UPON HIS KITCHEN GARDEN FOR THE SAKE OF ENLARGING HIS WORKS ON THE BOWLING GREEN AND FOR THAT REASON GENERALLY RAN HIS FIRST AND SECOND PARALLELS BETWIXT TWO ROWS OF HIS CABBAGES AND HIS CAULIFLOWERS
AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
THEY ARE AS ROTTEN AS DIRT SAID THE CORPORAL THEN BY ALL MEANS SAID MY FATHER BESPEAK A NEW PAIR BROTHER FOR THOUGH I KNOW CONTINUED MY FATHER TURNING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY
NO INDEED SAID MY FATHER YOU MAY GO WITH MY AUNT DINAH TO A VISITATION WITH A BEND SINISTER IF YOU THINK FIT MY POOR UNCLE TOBY BLUSH'D MY FATHER WAS VEXED AT HIMSELF NO MY DEAR BROTHER TOBY SAID MY FATHER CHANGING HIS TONE
THE CONVENIENCES AND INCONVENIENCES OF WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED AT LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AND THE CORPORAL'S CAMPAIGNS OF WHICH THIS I'M NOW WRITING IS BUT A SKETCH AND WILL BE FINISHED IF I CONJECTURE RIGHT IN THREE PAGES BUT THERE IS NO GUESSING
WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD EXCEPT POLITICKS THE CLERGY KNOW THE LEAST OF HERALDRY SAID YORICK NO MATTER FOR THAT CRIED MY FATHER I SHOULD BE SORRY TO APPEAR WITH A BLOT IN MY ESCUTCHEON BEFORE THEM NEVER MIND THE BEND SINISTER SAID MY UNCLE TOBY PUTTING ON HIS TYE WIG
MY FATHER HAD SUCH A SKIRMISHING CUTTING KIND OF A SLASHING WAY WITH HIM IN HIS DISPUTATIONS THRUSTING AND RIPPING AND GIVING EVERY ONE A STROKE TO REMEMBER HIM BY IN HIS TURN
AND DRUSEN AND HAGENAU AND THEN IT WAS OSTEND AND MENIN AND AETH AND DENDERMOND SURELY NEVER DID ANY TOWN ACT SO MANY PARTS SINCE SODOM AND GOMORRAH AS MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOWN DID IN THE FOURTH YEAR
THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER
WHEN THE TOWN WITH ITS WORKS WAS FINISHED MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL BEGAN TO RUN THEIR FIRST PARALLEL NOT AT RANDOM OR ANY HOW BUT FROM THE SAME POINTS AND DISTANCES THE ALLIES HAD BEGUN TO RUN THEIRS
WHAT INTENSE PLEASURE SWIMMING IN HIS EYE AS HE STOOD OVER THE CORPORAL READING THE PARAGRAPH TEN TIMES OVER TO HIM AS HE WAS AT WORK LEST PERADVENTURE HE SHOULD MAKE THE BREACH AN INCH TOO WIDE OR LEAVE IT AN INCH TOO NARROW
AND THE REST OF THE TOWNS IN BRABANT AND FLANDERS THE OTHER WAS NOT TO HAVE THE HOUSES RUN UP TOGETHER AS THE CORPORAL PROPOSED BUT TO HAVE EVERY HOUSE INDEPENDENT TO HOOK ON OR OFF SO AS TO FORM INTO THE PLAN OF WHATEVER TOWN THEY PLEASED
YOU LOVE ANOTHER MAN AND HAVE ENTERED INTO CRIMINAL INTRIGUES WITH HIM MIMICKING HER HUSBAND SHE THREW AN EMPHASIS ON THE WORD CRIMINAL AS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID
AND HOW THEY WERE PRESERVED AND OF THE CARRIAGES AND DOGCARTS IN WHICH THE SHOOTING PARTY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND THE LUNCHEON PAVILION THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED UP AT THE MARSH I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID LEVIN SITTING UP IN THE HAY
IN GIVING A PURELY PARTY CHARACTER TO THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WHICH OUGHT BY RIGHTS TO BE OF SUCH AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS TO PUT IN HIS PLACE A FRESH CAPABLE PERFECTLY MODERN MAN
AND A PROUD AND HARD EXPRESSION CAME OVER HIS FACE YES YES THAT'S BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER I KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT WAS HE SAID BUT SHE WAS NOT LISTENING TO HIS WORDS SHE WAS READING HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
SKIPPING ALONG THE AVENUE AND SOME ONE ELSE TOO PAPA OF COURSE CRIED LEVIN STOPPING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE AVENUE KITTY DON'T COME DOWN THE STEEP STAIRCASE GO ROUND
GAVE HER AN IMPRESSION OF WEALTH AND SUMPTUOUSNESS AND OF THAT MODERN EUROPEAN LUXURY OF WHICH SHE HAD ONLY READ IN ENGLISH NOVELS BUT HAD NEVER SEEN IN RUSSIA AND IN THE COUNTRY EVERYTHING WAS NEW
AND THEREBY TO BE OF THE GREATEST BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY THE SERVANT HAD SET THE TEA AND LEFT THE ROOM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WRITING TABLE
SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THERE HAD BEEN REVEALED TO LEVIN SO MANY NEW AND SERIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE
SEEMS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SLEEP THEN WHAT CHANCE OF SLEEP TODAY SAID THE OLD MAN
THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL BESIDE ANNA ON A HOT LOOKING GRAY CAVALRY HORSE WAS VASSENKA VESLOVSKY IN HIS SCOTCH CAP WITH FLOATING RIBBONS
SAINTE NITOUCHE MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THIS GENTLEMAN WHILE ALL THE WHILE SHE WAS THINKING OF NOTHING BUT GETTING MARRIED
THAT ANYONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER AS HER HUSBAND KNEW HER COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING UNNATURAL EITHER IN THE SOUND OR THE SENSE OF HER WORDS BUT TO HIM KNOWING HER KNOWING THAT WHENEVER HE WENT TO BED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN USUAL
THE FIRST ROW AS LEVIN NOTICED TIT HAD MOWED SPECIALLY QUICKLY PROBABLY WISHING TO PUT HIS MASTER TO THE TEST AND THE ROW HAPPENED TO BE A LONG ONE THE NEXT ROWS WERE EASIER BUT STILL LEVIN HAD TO STRAIN EVERY NERVE NOT TO DROP BEHIND THE PEASANTS
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN VAIN EVERY TIME LEVIN TRIED TO PENETRATE BEYOND THE OUTER CHAMBERS OF SVIAZHSKY'S MIND WHICH WERE HOSPITABLY OPEN TO ALL HE NOTICED THAT SVIAZHSKY WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED FAINT SIGNS OF ALARM WERE VISIBLE IN HIS EYES
WELL I SHALL GO BY MYSELF SAID VESLOVSKY GETTING UP EAGERLY AND PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND STOCKINGS GOOD BYE GENTLEMEN IF IT'S FUN I'LL FETCH YOU YOU'VE TREATED ME TO SOME GOOD SPORT AND I WON'T FORGET YOU
THE COUNT GOES INTO EVERYTHING HIMSELF AH WHAT A HUSBAND DOLLY WAS GLAD WHEN ANNA CAME IN AND BY HER ENTRANCE PUT A STOP TO ANNUSHKA'S GOSSIP
HER AVERSION FOR HIM EXTINGUISHED HER PITY FOR HIM
AND HE FELT STILL MORE FRIGHTENED WHEN KISSING HIM HE FELT WITH HIS LIPS THE DRYNESS OF HIS BROTHER'S SKIN AND SAW CLOSE TO HIM HIS BIG EYES FULL OF A STRANGE LIGHT
TURNING OUT HIS FEET THAT CARRIED HIS FULL FRAME SO EASILY HE PULLED UP THE BLIND AND RANG THE BELL LOUDLY IT WAS AT ONCE ANSWERED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLD FRIEND
IN THE QUEER FRENCH WHICH WAS THEIR ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION HEARING ANNA'S VOICE A SMART TALL ENGLISH NURSE WITH A DISAGREEABLE FACE AND A DISSOLUTE EXPRESSION WALKED IN AT THE DOOR
LEVIN LISTENED AND RACKED HIS BRAINS BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY NIKOLAY PROBABLY FELT THE SAME
WITH A BROAD RED BEARD GRAY ON HIS CHEEKS OPENED THE GATE
AT THE SAME TIME AS THE TRAVELER THERE WAS ANNOUNCED A PROVINCIAL MARSHAL OF NOBILITY ON A VISIT TO PETERSBURG WITH WHOM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION
ANNA HAD PUT ON A VERY SIMPLE BATISTE GOWN DOLLY SCRUTINIZED THAT SIMPLE GOWN ATTENTIVELY SHE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT AND THE PRICE AT WHICH SUCH SIMPLICITY WAS OBTAINED
THE MASTER SURE DOES HIS BEST FOR HIMSELF BUT SEE THE GRASS MISSED OUT FOR SUCH WORK US FELLOWS WOULD CATCH IT THE GRASS BECAME SOFTER AND LEVIN LISTENING WITHOUT ANSWERING FOLLOWED TIT
AS THOUGH IT WERE A HOLIDAY FOR HIMSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE AND ABOVE ALL UNPLEASANT WAS THAT PARTICULAR SMILE WITH WHICH SHE RESPONDED TO HIS SMILE NOISILY TALKING THEY ALL WENT INTO THE HOUSE
THE STEWARD DID NOT TAKE UP MUCH TIME HE SIMPLY GAVE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH THE MONEY HE NEEDED
AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID LEVIN WOULD UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE WOULD GIVE HIM A KINDLY GOOD HUMORED REPULSE JUST NOW SINCE HIS DISENCHANTMENT WITH FARMING
GIVE IT TO THIS PEASANT HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT YES BUT HOW AM I TO GIVE IT UP AM I TO GO TO HIM AND MAKE A DEED OF CONVEYANCE
AND HE WAS EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR HIM LEVIN PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP WHILE OBLONSKY PUTTING ON HIS SLIPPERS AND LIGHTING A CIGAR WALKED OUT OF THE BARN AND SOON THEIR VOICES WERE LOST
AND HE KNEW TOO THAT ALTHOUGH HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED AND ALTHOUGH BY EVERY TOKEN THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT WIFE HE COULD NO MORE HAVE MARRIED HER EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN LOVE WITH KITTY SHTCHERBATSKAYA THAN HE COULD HAVE FLOWN UP TO THE SKY
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S EYES WERE FAIRLY DAZZLED BY THE ELEGANT CARRIAGE OF A PATTERN SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE SPLENDID HORSES AND THE ELEGANT AND GORGEOUS PEOPLE SURROUNDING HER BUT WHAT STRUCK HER MOST OF ALL
AND BANKING COMPANIES THAT TOO IS PROFIT WITHOUT WORK YES THAT MAY ALL BE VERY TRUE AND CLEVER LIE DOWN KRAK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH CALLED TO HIS DOG
WHEREABOUTS WILL SHE BE WHERE HOW WHY DID SHE FIX ON THIS PLACE TO MEET ME AND WHY DOES SHE WRITE IN BETSY'S LETTER HE THOUGHT WONDERING NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AT IT BUT THERE WAS NOW NO TIME FOR WONDER
URGING THEM TO ELECT THE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES NOT FROM REGARD FOR PERSONS BUT FOR THE SERVICE AND WELFARE OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND HOPING THAT THE HONORABLE NOBILITY OF THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE WOULD AS AT ALL FORMER ELECTIONS
AH OUR HOST SO YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP YET HE SAID TO THE PEASANT WHO CAME INTO THE BARN OPENING THE CREAKING DOOR HOW IS IT YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP
PLUCKING UP HIS COURAGE BUT HAVING ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND HE WENT ON IN HIS SHRILL VOICE WITHOUT TIMIDITY OR HESITATION ACCENTUATING HERE AND THERE A WORD I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BEGAN
AND GOING TO THE DOOR HE CALLED THEM THEY THREW DOWN THE BOX THAT REPRESENTED A TRAIN AND CAME IN TO THEIR FATHER THE LITTLE GIRL HER FATHER'S FAVORITE RAN UP BOLDLY EMBRACED HIM AND HUNG LAUGHINGLY ON HIS NECK
WHY DO YOU KEEP FIDGETING WHY DON'T YOU GO TO SLEEP HIS BROTHER'S VOICE CALLED TO HIM OH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SLEEPY I HAVE HAD A GOOD SLEEP I'M NOT IN A SWEAT NOW JUST SEE FEEL MY SHIRT IT'S NOT WET IS IT LEVIN FELT
MIGHT SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER PROVINCES FOR ALL RUSSIA
OH I DON'T CARE SHE SAID HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND HE FANCIED THAT HER EYES LOOKED WITH STRANGE FURY AT HIM FROM UNDER THE VEIL I TELL YOU THAT'S NOT THE POINT I CAN'T DOUBT THAT BUT SEE WHAT HE WRITES TO ME READ IT
TONIGHT AT ONE O'CLOCK SHE WHISPERED AND WITH A HEAVY SIGH SHE WALKED WITH HER LIGHT SWIFT STEP TO MEET HER SON SERYOZHA HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE RAIN IN THE BIG GARDEN AND HE
YOUR TOO ANIMATED CONVERSATION THIS EVENING WITH COUNT VRONSKY HE ENUNCIATED THE NAME FIRMLY AND WITH DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ATTRACTED ATTENTION HE TALKED AND LOOKED AT HER LAUGHING EYES WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM NOW WITH THEIR IMPENETRABLE LOOK
THE SCENT OF BRILLIANTINE ON HIS WHISKERS STRUCK HIM AS PARTICULARLY PLEASANT IN THE FRESH AIR EVERYTHING HE SAW FROM THE CARRIAGE WINDOW EVERYTHING IN THAT COLD PURE AIR IN THE PALE LIGHT OF THE SUNSET
TWO CLERKS WERE WRITING AT TABLES WITH SCRATCHING PENS THE APPURTENANCES OF THE WRITING TABLES ABOUT WHICH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS HIMSELF VERY FASTIDIOUS WERE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD HE COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING THIS
AFTER VASSENKA HAD SEVERAL TIMES OVER EXPRESSED HIS APPRECIATION OF THIS DELIGHTFUL SLEEPING PLACE AMONG THE FRAGRANT HAY THIS DELIGHTFUL BROKEN CART HE SUPPOSED IT TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE THE SHAFTS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT
BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
TO INQUIRE INTO THE QUESTION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE THE QUESTION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP INCIDENTALLY IN THE COMMISSION OF THE SECOND OF JUNE AND HAD BEEN PRESSED FORWARD ACTIVELY BY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH
AND THE FRENCH WORK ON EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS THAT HE HAD BEGUN OVER THE EASY CHAIR THERE HUNG IN A GOLD FRAME AN OVAL PORTRAIT OF ANNA A FINE PAINTING BY A CELEBRATED ARTIST ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GLANCED AT IT
SHE WAS CALMER NOW AND HER FACE LIGHTED UP WITH A TENDER SMILE LEAVE YOUR HUSBAND AND MAKE OUR LIFE ONE IT IS ONE AS IT IS SHE ANSWERED SCARCELY AUDIBLY YES BUT ALTOGETHER ALTOGETHER
BUT HE FELT THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR THE VERY FACT OF THE LOW NECKED BODICE HAVING BEEN MADE IT SEEMED TO LEVIN THAT HE HAD DECEIVED SOMEONE THAT HE OUGHT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING BUT THAT TO EXPLAIN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE WEATHER HAD BECOME WORSE THAN EVER TOWARDS EVENING THE HAIL LASHED THE DRENCHED MARE SO CRUELLY THAT SHE WENT ALONG SIDEWAYS SHAKING HER HEAD AND EARS BUT LEVIN WAS ALL RIGHT UNDER HIS HOOD AND HE LOOKED CHEERFULLY ABOUT HIM AT THE MUDDY STREAMS RUNNING UNDER THE WHEELS
WAS THE WORD SON WHICH SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PRONOUNCE WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER SON AND HIS FUTURE ATTITUDE TO HIS MOTHER WHO HAD ABANDONED HIS FATHER SHE FELT SUCH TERROR
SITTING IN A SIDE SADDLE NAY A MAN SEE HOW SMARTLY HE'S GOING IT
AND NOTICING HIS GLOOMY EYES FIXED UPON HIM HE SAID IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING HOW IS IT THAT YOU LIVING CONSTANTLY IN THE COUNTRY ARE NOT A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
THAT SUMMER LEVIN SAW THIS AT EVERY STEP HE SENT THE MEN TO MOW SOME CLOVER FOR HAY PICKING OUT THE WORST PATCHES WHERE THE CLOVER WAS OVERGROWN WITH GRASS AND WEEDS AND OF NO USE FOR SEED AGAIN
SO YOU KEEP TO THE LEFT AND YOU'LL COME RIGHT ON IT SAID THE PEASANT UNMISTAKABLY LOTH TO LET THE TRAVELERS GO AND EAGER TO CONVERSE THE COACHMAN STARTED THE HORSES BUT THEY WERE ONLY JUST TURNING OFF
WHICH FELL UNDER ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S DEPARTMENT AND WAS A GLARING EXAMPLE OF FRUITLESS EXPENDITURE AND PAPER REFORMS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS AWARE OF THE TRUTH OF THIS THE IRRIGATION OF THESE LANDS IN THE ZARAISKY PROVINCE
I HAVE COME SIMPLY TO CONSULT YOU AS A PRELIMINARY STEP I WANT A DIVORCE BUT THE FORM IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE IS OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO ME IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT IF THAT FORM DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MY REQUIREMENTS I MAY GIVE UP A LEGAL DIVORCE
BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL SEATED LEVIN TURNED AND WENT OUT KITTY SAW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HER HUSBAND SHE TRIED TO SEIZE A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO HIM ALONE BUT HE MADE HASTE TO GET AWAY FROM HER
AND THE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED AND LEVIN BUSY SEEING AFTER HIS OWN AFFAIRS DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS
SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE FOLLOWING CASES PHYSICAL DEFECT IN THE MARRIED PARTIES DESERTION WITHOUT COMMUNICATION FOR FIVE YEARS HE SAID CROOKING A SHORT FINGER COVERED WITH HAIR ADULTERY
IN THE NURSERY THE LUXURY WHICH HAD IMPRESSED DOLLY IN THE WHOLE HOUSE STRUCK HER STILL MORE THERE WERE LITTLE GO CARTS ORDERED FROM ENGLAND AND APPLIANCES FOR LEARNING TO WALK
I'VE ONLY JUST COME
LEVIN WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE BALUSTRADE LOOKED AND LISTENED AT FIRST HE WONDERED
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND IN THIS STRUGGLE HE SAW THAT WITH IMMENSE EXPENDITURE OF FORCE ON HIS SIDE AND WITH NO EFFORT OR EVEN INTENTION ON THE OTHER SIDE
SHE SAID TELL ME FRANKLY YOU WERE VEXED AT GETTING MY LETTER AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME AS SOON AS SHE HAD SAID IT SHE FELT THAT HOWEVER WARM HIS FEELINGS WERE TO HER HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER FOR THAT YES HE SAID
AND CONSCIOUS OF THEIR LOVE THAT EVENING AND THEIR HAPPINESS IN THEIR LOVE SEEMED TO IMPLY A DISAGREEABLE SLUR ON THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FEEL THE SAME AND COULD NOT AND THEY FELT A PRICK OF CONSCIENCE
MOVING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE A PORTFOLIO OF PAPERS WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION HE TOOK A PENCIL FROM A RACK AND PLUNGED INTO THE PERUSAL OF A COMPLEX REPORT RELATING TO THE PRESENT COMPLICATION
ONCE MORE KISSING HER HAND HOLDING IT IN ONE OF HIS AND PATTING IT WITH THE OTHER LEVIN WHO A MINUTE BEFORE HAD BEEN IN THE HAPPIEST FRAME OF MIND NOW LOOKED DARKLY AT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING DISPLEASED HIM
WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
CLASPED THE POT THE BEAUTY OF HER WHOLE FIGURE HER HEAD HER NECK HER HANDS STRUCK VRONSKY EVERY TIME AS SOMETHING NEW AND UNEXPECTED HE STOOD STILL GAZING AT HER IN ECSTASY
IT'S A FIGHT HE SAID SCOWLING AND SETTING HIS POWERFUL JAWS
BUT WHY SHOULD I GO BUT DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREPARING TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FINDING HIS CAP AND GETTING UP HOW SO DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T SEE THE LINE YOU'VE TAKEN UP WITH YOUR WIFE
THE SECRETARY KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED AND LEVIN WAS MET BY TWO RED FACED GENTLEMEN WHO DARTED OUT
HIS EYES AND HIS VARNISHED BOOTS SHINING IN A WEEK'S TIME YOUR ANSWER AS TO WHETHER YOU WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONDUCT THE CASE AND ON WHAT TERMS YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO COMMUNICATE TO ME VERY GOOD
THE CANDIDATE WHO WAS BEING VOTED ON WAS NEVYEDOVSKY WHO HAD SO STOUTLY DENIED ALL IDEA OF STANDING LEVIN WENT UP TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM IT WAS LOCKED
THE DRESS WAS SET RIGHT BUT THERE WAS NEARLY A QUARREL WITH THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS ON THE MORNING HOWEVER ALL WAS HAPPILY ARRANGED AND TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK
READING OF ONE BOOK AFTER ANOTHER FILLED UP HER TIME BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THE COACHMAN CAME BACK WITHOUT HIM SHE FELT THAT NOW SHE WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF STIFLING THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE JUST AT THAT TIME HER LITTLE GIRL WAS TAKEN ILL
LET'S GO LET'S HAVE A WALK WE SHAN'T GO TO SLEEP YOU KNOW OBLONSKY COME ALONG IF ONE COULD ONLY DO BOTH LIE HERE AND GO ANSWERED OBLONSKY STRETCHING IT'S CAPITAL LYING HERE
AND THERE WERE SOME SORT OF LITTLE DECANTERS ON THE TABLE AND THEY WERE WOMEN TOO HE REMEMBERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES TWINKLED GAILY AND HE PONDERED WITH A SMILE YES IT WAS NICE VERY NICE
AGAFEA MIHALOVNA'S ALLUSION TO THE VERY SUBJECT HE HAD ONLY JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT HURT AND STUNG HIM LEVIN SCOWLED AND WITHOUT ANSWERING HER HE SAT DOWN AGAIN TO HIS WORK REPEATING TO HIMSELF ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT WORK
I'LL TRY NOT TO LET IT GO HE SAID TAKING HIS STAND BEHIND TIT AND WAITING FOR THE TIME TO BEGIN
COST DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MUCH LOSS OF TEMPER THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS IN ALTERING IT HAD MADE THE SEAMS IN THE WRONG PLACE HAD TAKEN UP THE SLEEVES TOO MUCH AND ALTOGETHER SPOILT THE DRESS
I WASN'T DULL DOES THAT OFFEND YOU ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHIVERED AND BENT HIS HANDS TO MAKE THE JOINTS CRACK
WERE VERY WELL AWARE THAT THERE HAD HAPPENED AN EVENT WHICH THOUGH NEGATIVE WAS OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE THEY BOTH HAD THE SAME FEELING
THERE WAS A GLEAM LIKE THE MALIGNANT GLEAM HE SAW IN HIS WIFE'S EYES YOU DESIRE MY ASSISTANCE IN SECURING A DIVORCE YES PRECISELY SO BUT I OUGHT TO WARN YOU THAT I MAY BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION
HE KEPT TURNING ROUND TRYING TO LOOK AT HIS LITTLE JACKET FROM BEHIND BUT ALL THE SAME HE WAS WONDERFULLY SWEET TANYA BEHAVED LIKE A GROWNUP PERSON AND LOOKED AFTER THE LITTLE ONES
PUT IT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHISPERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS WITH HIS BROTHER LEVIN FOLLOWED THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT TO THE TABLE BUT LEVIN HAD FORGOTTEN BY NOW THE CALCULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM
THE YOUNGER WAS FOR BURYING IT UNTIL NIGHT HAD COME AGAIN THEY SQUABBLED AND BICKERED AND ARGUED TILL THE NOISE THEY MADE WAKENED BABO AND HE SAT UP THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF WAS THE ADVICE THAT THE DOCTOR HAD GIVEN HIM THE EVENING BEFORE THINK WELL HE BAWLED OUT
WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
WHEN THE QUEEN SAW THE HUGE BASIN FULL OF SILVER TREASURE HER CHEEKS AND HER FOREHEAD FLUSHED AS RED AS FIRE THEY WENT INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND WHEN THE QUEEN SAW THE BASIN OF GOLD HER FACE TURNED AS WHITE AS ASHES
I WILL DO THAT BUT YOU MUST PAY ME TWO THOUSAND GOLDEN ANGELS TWO THOUSAND GOLDEN ANGELS SAID THE RICH MAN THAT IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE IT IF ONLY YOU WILL CURE MY DAUGHTER
HAD PAID HIM THE GOLDEN ANGEL HE HAD PROMISED FOR THE USE OF THE FORGE THE DOCTOR PULLED A SOUR FACE BUT ALL THE SAME HE HAD TO PAY THE ANGEL THEN THE SMITH LET HIM GO AND OFF HE MARCHED IN A HUFF
TO DAY WAS LAMENTATION ALL THE CITY WAS SHROUDED IN GLOOM AND EVERYWHERE WAS WEEPING AND CRYING SEVEN BLACK SLAVES STOOD ON GUARD NEAR ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL AS HE LAY UPON HIS COUCH
AROUND THE WALL AND FACING THE BASIN FROM ALL SIDES STOOD SIX GOLDEN STATUES
BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
THERE STOOD GUARDS IN ARMOR OF BRASS AND SILVER AND GOLD BUT THEY WERE WITHOUT LIFE THEY WERE ALL OF STONE AS WHITE AS ALABASTER THENCE THEY PASSED THROUGH ROOM AFTER ROOM AND APARTMENT AFTER APARTMENT
BE SILENT SAID THE YOUNG MAN SIX TIMES VILE THING YOU WOULD HAVE BETRAYED ME SIX TIMES YOU WOULD HAVE DEPRIVED ME OF JOYS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE AND EACH WAS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH WENT BEFORE
CLATTERED THE BOTTOM OF HIS CANICAN AGAINST THE TABLE
AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE SHINING HE COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LISTENED YES SAID HE I THINK I HEAR THE WATER RUSHING BUT I AM NOT SURE I WILL JUST GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN
THEY WILL BE OF USE BY AND BY AND AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP A GREAT STONE AS BIG AS HIS TWO FISTS AND DROPPED IT INTO THE POUCH THAT DANGLED AT HIS SIDE NOT I SAID BABO I WILL CARRY NO STONE WITH ME
NOTHING IS EASIER SAID ZADOK THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN I COMMAND YOU TO TAKE ME TO WHERE SHE IS SO THAT I MAY SEE HER WITH MINE OWN EYES I HEAR AND OBEY SAID THE DEMON
BUT BABO HAD KEPT HIS EYES OPEN SIMON AGRICOLA HAD LAID DOWN THE VIAL UPON THE TABLE AND WHILE THEY WERE SAYING THIS AND THAT BACK AND FORTH THINKING OF NOTHING ELSE BABO QUIETLY SLIPPED IT INTO HIS OWN POCKET WITHOUT ANY ONE BUT HIMSELF BEING THE WISER
I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
HE SIGHED HE MELTED THE TEARS BURST FROM HIS EYES AND RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
SHE WAS COLD AND DEAD OF STONE AS WHITE AS MARBLE THE YOUNG MAN APPROACHED AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE AND WHEN HE LOOKED HIS BREATH BECAME FAINT AND HIS HEART GREW SOFT WITHIN HIM LIKE WAX IN A FLAME OF FIRE
SO FOR SEVEN MONTHS HE LIVED A LIFE OF JOY AND DELIGHT THEN ONE MORNING HE AWAKENED AND FOUND EVERYTHING CHANGED TO GRIEF AND MOURNING WHERE THE DAY BEFORE HAD BEEN LAUGHTER TO DAY WAS CRYING
OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
TELL ME SAID ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL WHY ARE YOU ALL SO SORROWFUL INSTANTLY THEY WHO STOOD WAITING BEGAN CRYING AND TEARING THEIR CLOTHES AND BEATING THEIR HANDS AS FOR THE CHAMBERLAIN HE WAS A REVEREND OLD MAN
WAS A STONE NO LONGER BUT A FINE LOAF OF WHITE BREAD AS BIG AS YOUR TWO FISTS YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN BABO GOGGLE AND STARE GIVE ME A PIECE OF YOUR BREAD MASTER SAID HE NOT I SAID AGRICOLA
OUT FROM THE TOWN AND ACROSS THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE WOODS UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A DREARY LONESOME DESERT WHERE NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT GRAY ROCKS AND WEEDS AND THISTLES
HE JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND AWAY HE SCAMPERED WITH THE COOK AT HIS HEELS WELL THE UPSHOT OF THE BUSINESS WAS THAT SIMON AGRICOLA HAD TO GO BACK AND BRING LIFE TO THE WOMAN AGAIN OR THE COOK WOULD THUMP HIM AND BABO BOTH WITH THE ROLLING PIN AND WHAT WAS MORE
AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
HEED WELL WHAT I TELL YOU SPEAK NOT A SINGLE WORD FOR IF YOU DO MISFORTUNE WILL BE SURE TO HAPPEN AIN'T I TO SAY ANYTHING SAID THE FISHERMAN NO NOT EVEN BOO TO A GOOSE NO WELL
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MAKE YOUR MOTHER OVER YONDER YOUNG AGAIN I SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER SAID THE SMITH VERY WELL SAID BABO GIVE ME THE GOLDEN ANGEL THAT THE MASTER GAVE YOU AND I'LL DO THE JOB FOR YOU
AND BEGAN BEATING HIMSELF VIOLENTLY UPON THE HEAD WITH GREAT OUTCRYING ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL NOT KNOWING WHAT TO THINK OR WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN RAN BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AGAIN
THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS CARRYING HIM LIT UPON THE GROUND AND THERE THE FISHERMAN FOUND HIMSELF STANDING FOR THAT WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM HAD GONE THE OLD MAN WHIPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF OFF HIS EYES AND THERE THE FISHERMAN FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA
SUCH A HUBBUB HAD NOT BEEN HEARD IN THAT TOWN FOR MANY A DAY BACK CAME SIMON AGRICOLA RUNNING AND THERE HE SAW AND TOOK IT ALL IN IN ONE LOOK STOP FRIEND SAID HE TO THE SMITH LET THE SIMPLETON GO THIS IS NOT PAST MENDING YET
THOU MAYST GO NOW ZADOK SAID THE YOUNG MAN TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS ZADOK LAUGHED AND VANISHED THE YOUNG MAN STOOD FOR A WHILE LOOKING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL FIGURE OF ALABASTER
TOOK A BAG FROM THE CHEST UNTIED IT AND EMPTIED A CATARACT OF GOLD INTO THE FUR CAP THE FISHERMAN HAD NEVER SEEN SO MUCH WEALTH IN ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE AND HE STOOD LIKE A MAN TURNED TO STONE IS THIS ALL MINE SAID THE FISHERMAN
HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
THAT IS PRETTY HARD UPON A MAN WHO LIKES TO SAY HIS SAY SAID THE FISHERMAN AND MOREOVER SAID THE OLD MAN I MUST BLINDFOLD YOU AS WELL THEREUPON HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A HANDKERCHIEF AND MADE READY TO TIE IT ABOUT THE FISHERMAN'S EYES
IT OPENED SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY AND THEY ENTERED WITHIN WAS A NARROW ROOM AS RED AS BLOOD A FLAMING LAMP HUNG FROM THE CEILING ABOVE THE YOUNG MAN STOOD AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE
THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
AND HIS HAIR AS WHITE AS SNOW
DIE A FOOL SAID AGRICOLA BUT COME IN BABO COME IN HERE IS ROOM ENOUGH FOR TWO SO THAT NIGHT BABO HAD A GOOD SUPPER AND A SOUND SLEEP AND THAT IS A CURE FOR MOST OF A BODY'S TROUBLES IN THIS WORLD
AT THE FARTHER END WAS A GOLDEN THRONE AND UPON IT SAT A LADY MORE LOVELY AND BEAUTIFUL THAN A DREAM HER EYES AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS HER CHEEKS LIKE ROSE LEAVES AND HER HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD
LOOK FRIEND SAID BABO TO THE COOK HERE I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME MEDICINE GIVE ME THE TWO HUNDRED PENNIES THAT THE MASTER WOULD NOT TAKE AND I'LL CURE HER FOR YOU AS SOUND AS A BOTTLE VERY WELL SAID THE COOK AND HE COUNTED OUT THE TWO HUNDRED PENNIES AND BABO SLIPPED THEM INTO HIS POCKET
THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
HE SEIZED THE YOUNG MAN BY THE GIRDLE AND IN AN INSTANT FLEW AWAY WITH HIM TO A HANGING GARDEN THAT LAY BEFORE THE QUEEN'S PALACE THOU ART THE FIRST MAN SAID ZADOK WHO HAS SEEN
THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN I COMMAND YOU TO TAKE ME THITHER INSTANTLY
HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR WAS A BASIN SUCH AS ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL HAD SEEN IN THE OTHER ROOM BEYOND ONLY THIS WAS FILLED WITH GOLD
DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
UP STEPPED THE WISE MAN TO THE GALLOWS AND GAVE IT A SHARP RAP WITH HIS STAFF THEN LO AND BEHOLD THE GALLOWS WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A FINE INN WITH LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS
I WILL NOT DENY MY FRIEND THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND THAT IT IS MY TURN SAID THE FISHERMAN NOR WILL I DENY THAT I HAVE ALREADY A STORY IN MY MIND IT IS SAID HE ABOUT A CERTAIN PRINCE AND OF HOW HE WENT THROUGH MANY AND ONE ADVENTURES AND AT LAST DISCOVERED THAT WHICH IS
I WOULD AS LIEF AS NOT I LIKED THE STORY WELL ENOUGH PIPED UP THE LITTLE TAILOR WHO HAD KILLED SEVEN FLIES AT A BLOW TWAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY OF ITS SORT BUT WHY DOES NOBODY TELL A TALE OF GOOD BIG GIANTS AND OF WILD BOARS AND OF UNICORNS
CALLED THE WISE ALL THIS HAPPINESS THIS ECSTASY THAT IS NOW MINE
BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
PRESENTLY THERE BEGAN A RUMBLING THAT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER AND NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL IT ROARED AND BELLOWED LIKE THUNDER THE EARTH ROCKED AND SWAYED AND THE POOR FISHERMAN SHOOK AND TREMBLED WITH FEAR TILL HIS TEETH CLATTERED IN HIS HEAD
AND PHST POP OUT CAME ILL LUCK ALONG WITH IT PLAGUE TAKE THE FIDDLER SAY I LISTEN SAYS ILL LUCK IT HAS BEEN MANY A LONG DAY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THAT HAZEL NUT AND YOU ARE THE MAN THAT HAS LET ME OUT
THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK SAINT NICHOLAS DID
WHO ARE YOU IT SAID ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL FELL UPON HIS KNEES I AM HE WHO WAS SENT TO BRING YOU TO LIFE HE SAID MY FATHER TURNED YOU TO COLD STONE AND I
AND THE CHEEKS AND LIPS GROW RED WITH LIFE MEANTIME A MURMUR HAD BEGUN TO RISE ALL THROUGH THE PALACE IT GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER IT BECAME A SHOUT THE FIGURE OF THE QUEEN THAT HAD BEEN STONE OPENED ITS EYES
AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
THE YOUNG MAN SMOTE HIS HAND UPON HIS HEAD WHAT A FOOL I AM SAID HE NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT TO CALL UPON ZADOK BEFORE THIS THEN HE CALLED ALOUD
WHAT HE CRIED ART THOU NOT CONTENTED WITH ALL THOU HAST AND WITH ALL THAT WE DO FOR THEE WITHOUT ASKING THE FORBIDDEN QUESTION THEREUPON HE TORE HIS CAP FROM HIS HEAD AND FLUNG IT UPON THE GROUND
SAID HE SPITTING HIS WORDS AT HER IF YOU WILL DRIVE ME OUT INTO THE NIGHT I SUPPOSE I WILL HAVE TO GO AND THEN HE SPOKE THE WORDS THAT SO MANY MEN SAY MANY A MAN HAS COME TO TROUBLE BY FOLLOWING HIS WIFE'S ADVICE
BY AND BY HE MANAGED TO SCREW HIS HEAD AROUND AND LOOK UP AND THERE IT WAS ILL LUCK THAT HAD HIM I THOUGHT SO SAID THE FIDDLER AND THEN HE GAVE OVER KICKING WELL ON AND ON THEY FLEW OVER HILL AND VALLEY OVER MOOR AND MOUNTAIN
FOR THERE STOOD A GIGANTIC BLACK DEMON WITH A NAPKIN WRAPPED AROUND HIS LOINS AND A SCIMITAR IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE BLADE OF WHICH GLEAMED LIKE LIGHTNING IN THE FLAME OF THE LAMP BEFORE HIM LAY A BASKET FILLED WITH SAWDUST
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT SAID SIMON AGRICOLA THEN I WILL SHOW YOU SAID BABO HE SPREAD A BED OF COLD DEAD ASHES UPON HIS PALM NOW SAID HE I WILL TAKE THE EMBER UPON THAT AGRICOLA ROLLED UP HIS EYES LIKE A DUCK IN A THUNDER STORM
DOWN THEY DROPPED THE POT OF MONEY AND AWAY THEY SCAMPERED AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BABO HEARD THEM RUNNING AND POKED HIS HEAD THROUGH THE HEDGE AND THERE LAY THE POT OF GOLD LOOK NOW SAID HE THIS HAS COME FROM THE ADVICE THAT WAS GIVEN ME
AND SO SHE HAD COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN FOR A BIT OF REST AND THERE SHE SAT UNDER THE SHADE OF AN APPLE TREE FANNING HERSELF AND CRYING WHEN SWASH DOWN FELL THE FIDDLER INTO THE APPLE TREE AND DOWN FELL A DOZEN APPLES
AND SAY NOT A WORD DO YOU AGREE TO THAT YES SAID THE SERVANT I DO VERY WELL SAID HIS NEW COMRADE THEN LET US BE JOGGING
BEAR THY PUNISHMENT THOU FOOL SAID THE TALISMAN
OR LEAVE ME FOREVER THEY HAD BOTH FORGOTTEN THAT THE DEMON ZADOK WAS THERE THEN THE YOUNG MAN BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE TALISMAN OF SOLOMON TELL ME O TALISMAN SAID HE HOW SHALL I OPEN YONDER DOOR OH WRETCHED ONE
THE FISHERMAN GRUMBLED AND GRUMBLED AND SWORE THAT HE WOULD NOT GO THE WIFE SAID NOTHING BUT ONE THING SHE DID NOT ARGUE SHE DID NOT LOSE HER TEMPER SHE ONLY SAID TO EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID MY ADVICE TO YOU IS THAT YOU GO
YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THAT DOOR YONDER AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOULD YOU DO SO ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU OH NO THE FIDDLER WOULD NEVER THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING AS OPENING THE DOOR
AND FLEW THROUGH THE AIR SO SWIFTLY THAT THE STARS APPEARED TO SLIDE AWAY BEHIND THEM IN A MOMENT HE SET THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN UPON THE GROUND AND ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL FOUND HIMSELF AT THE END OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A VAST AND SPLENDID GARDEN
BUT WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE STOOD WAS A GREAT ARCHED DOOR OF ADAMANT THE DOOR WAS TIGHTLY SHUT AND THERE WAS NEITHER LOCK NOR KEY TO IT UPON THE DOOR WERE WRITTEN THESE WORDS IN LETTERS OF FLAME
ILL LUCK AND THE FIDDLER ONCE UPON A TIME SAINT NICHOLAS CAME DOWN INTO THE WORLD TO TAKE A PEEP AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE HOW THINGS LOOKED IN THE SPRING TIME ON HE STEPPED ALONG THE ROAD TO THE TOWN WHERE HE USED TO LIVE
FOR I CANNOT OPEN IT FOR MYSELF AS THERE IS NEITHER LOCK NOR KEY TO IT THAT ALSO I AM FORBIDDEN TO DO SAID ZADOK I WISH THAT I KNEW WHAT WAS THERE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DEMON LAUGHED
VERY WELL SAID BABO AND THE BARGAIN WAS STRUCK SO THE NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY OFF THEY STARTED UPON THEIR JOURNEY CHEEK BY JOWL THE WISE MAN AND THE SIMPLETON TO MAKE THEIR FORTUNES IN THE WIDE WORLD
THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A FISHERMAN WHO HAD FISHED ALL DAY LONG AND HAD CAUGHT NOT SO MUCH AS A SPRAT SO AT NIGHT THERE HE SAT BY THE FIRE RUBBING HIS KNEES AND WARMING HIS SHINS AND WAITING FOR SUPPER THAT HIS WIFE WAS COOKING FOR HIM
HAD ME BEATEN WITH FIFTY LASHES I BRING THE TREASURE SAID ZADOK FROM THE TREASURE HOUSE OF THE ANCIENT KINGS OF EGYPT
AND NOT SO MUCH AS A CRUST OF BREAD WAS BROUGHT TO STAY HIS STOMACH BY AND BY THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND THEN THE TWO WHO SAT UPON THE THRONE AROSE THE BEAUTIFUL LADY TOOK THE MAGICIAN BY THE HAND AND TURNING TO THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE
AND THE GOLD WAS LIKE THAT HE HAD FOUND IN THE GARDEN WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THIS VAST AND AMAZING WEALTH HE STOOD SPEECHLESS AND BREATHLESS WITH WONDER THE DEMON ZADOK LAUGHED THIS SAID HE IS GREAT BUT IT IS LITTLE
THEN DOWN HE TOOK HIS FUR CAP AND UP HE TOOK HIS NETS AND OFF HE AND THE OLD MAN MARCHED THROUGH THE MOONLIGHT THEIR SHADOWS BOBBING ALONG LIKE BLACK SPIDERS BEHIND THEM WELL ON THEY WENT
THE TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH A FEAST THAT SMELLED SO GOOD THAT IT BROUGHT TEARS TO THE FIDDLER'S EYES AND WATER TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL THE PLATES WERE OF PURE GOLD THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAT ALONE BUT ANOTHER PLACE WAS SPREAD
UNKNOWN TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO ME IT IS FOLLY IT IS MADNESS BUT WHEN I LIE AWAKE BY HIM IN THE DARKNESS I ASK MYSELF WHETHER ANY UNCONSCIOUS DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH ESCAPES ME IN THE CLOSE INTIMACY THAT NOW UNITES US
I CAN TELL YOU MISTER ARMADALE IT DWELLS ON MINE YOU KNOW MY OPINION OF MISS GWILT AND YOU KNOW WHAT MISS GWILT HERSELF HAS DONE THIS VERY EVENING TO JUSTIFY THAT OPINION EVEN IN YOUR EYES
THE BOOKS WHICH MISSUS ARMADALE HAD LEFT BEHIND HER THE FURNITURE THE OLD MATTING ON THE FLOOR THE OLD PAPER ON THE WALLS WERE ALL UNDISTURBED
THE MAJOR STOPPED HER THE MOMENT YOUR NAME PASSED HER LIPS HE DECLARED HE WOULD NEVER HEAR YOU MENTIONED AGAIN BY ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY SHE HAS BEEN LEFT IN THE DARK FROM THAT TIME TO THIS NOT KNOWING HOW SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISREPRESENTED BY MISS GWILT
AS I HOPE TO BE SAVED ALL THE OLD HARRIDANS OF THE WORLD OF FASHION WHOM
PERFECTLY CURLED THAT DROPPED OVER HER LEFT SHOULDER HER GLOVES FITTING HER LIKE A SECOND SKIN
HIS FACE SHOWED SIGNS OF WEAR AND TEAR VERY SAD TO SEE IN SO YOUNG A MAN BUT HE SPOKE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FUTURE WITH A COURAGE AND HOPEFULNESS WHICH MEN OF TWICE HIS YEARS IF HE HAS SUFFERED AS I SUSPECT HIM TO HAVE SUFFERED MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
AND YOU MAY BE A WIDOWER AND I MAY BE A WIDOW AND THE CRUEL LAW MAY CONSIDER US EMANCIPATED WHEN IT'S TOO LATE TO BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE BY THAT TIME NO DOUBT I SHALL BE OLD AND UGLY
WHY WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN I WAS COMING BACK SAYS THE SAILOR SHE LOOKED HIM STEADILY IN THE FACE AND ANSWERED I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU THERE DO YOU THINK SUCH A WOMAN AS THAT
WE HAD A TOUGH FIGHT BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH A POINT OCCURRED TO ME JUST AS I GOT UP TO GO AND I WENT BACK TO MY CHAIR AND SETTLED THE QUESTION IN NO TIME OF COURSE I STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN COVENT GARDEN WILLIAM THE WAITER
SOMETIMES LEADS TO GREAT RESULTS I DOUBT HOWEVER IF YOU WILL FIND IT LEADING TO MUCH ON THIS OCCASION ALL I KNOW OF THE MYSTERY OF THE SANITARIUM I KNOW FROM MISTER ARMADALE AND HE IS ENTIRELY IN THE DARK ON MORE THAN ONE POINT OF IMPORTANCE
I DISCOURAGE HIS BRINGING ANY STRANGERS TO SEE ME FOR THOUGH YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I WAS LAST AT NAPLES I CANNOT BE SURE THAT SOME OF THE MANY PEOPLE I ONCE KNEW IN THIS PLACE MAY NOT BE LIVING STILL
NO SUCH IDEA HAD EVER ENTERED YOUR HEAD DID SHE SEEM RELIEVED ASKED ALLAN
IF YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOURSELF YOU WOULDN'T THINK SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY TOO OLD WOULD YOU I CAN'T SAY I SHOULD THINK IT TOO OLD IF IF YOU WERE REALLY FOND OF HER ONCE MORE THERE WAS NO ANSWER
IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE HER BEING ONLY A GOVERNESS WOULDN'T STAND IN THE WAY WITH YOU NO SAID MIDWINTER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY IT WOULD STAND IN THE WAY WITH ME HE GAVE THE ANSWER RELUCTANTLY AND PUSHED HIS CHAIR BACK OUT OF THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP
I SHALL GO BACK TO MY DIARY SUPPOSING I WAS NOT THE ALTERED WOMAN I AM I ONLY SAY SUPPOSING HOW WOULD THE GRAND RISK THAT I ONCE THOUGHT OF RUNNING LOOK NOW I HAVE MARRIED MIDWINTER IN THE NAME THAT IS REALLY HIS OWN
THIS IS ONE OF THE UNALTERABLE RESULTS OF THE MARRIAGE WELL HAVING TAKEN THE FIRST STEP THEN WHETHER I WOULD OR NO HOW SUPPOSING I MEANT TO TAKE THE SECOND STEP WHICH I DON'T HOW WOULD PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES STAND TOWARD ME
OR WHAT FALSEHOODS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE OF HER AT MY AGE AND IN MY PROFESSION I DON'T PROFESS TO HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY SOFTNESS OF HEART
DON'T LOOK AT ME LOOK AT BLACKSTONE AND BEGIN
READ EVERY WORD OF IT AND THEN COME HERE AND EXPLAIN IT TO ME WHAT YOU DON'T THINK YOUR HEAD IS TO BE TRUSTED TO DO SUCH A SIMPLE THING AS THAT I'M CERTAIN IT ISN'T SAID ALLAN
WHY SHOULD MISTER ARMADALE THINK YOU MIXED UP IN IT
WHICH GIVES ME NO EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING THEM I THOUGHT I HAD SUFFERED THE SHARPEST PAIN THAT I COULD FEEL WHEN MY FIRST HUSBAND LAID HIS WHIP ACROSS MY FACE I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORST THAT DESPAIR COULD DO ON THE DAY WHEN I KNEW THAT THE OTHER VILLAIN THE MEANER VILLAIN STILL
FAR MORE SENSITIVELY THAN SHE FELT THE THREAT SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS EVERYBODY HAD KNOWN IN THE HOUSE THAT SOME UNACKNOWLEDGED PROCEEDINGS OF YOURS IN LONDON HAD LED TO MISS GWILT'S VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL FROM HER SITUATION
CHARGED WITH FRAUDULENTLY REPRESENTING HERSELF TO BE THE MISSING WIDOW OF AN OFFICER IN THE MERCHANT SERVICE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DROWNED THE NAME OF THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND LIVING AND THE NAME OF THE OFFICER
HE TRIMMED THE LAMP ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM AND LOOKED OUT AT THE NIGHT THE STABLE CLOCK WAS CHIMING THE HALF HOUR PAST ELEVEN AS HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND THE FIRST RAIN DROPS WERE BEGINNING TO FALL
IS AN EXAMPLE WORTH YOUR NOTICE
HERE'S A BIT THAT'S MORE IN OUR WAY INCAPACITIES IF ANY PERSONS UNDER LEGAL INCAPACITIES COME TOGETHER IT IS A MERETRICIOUS AND NOT A MATRIMONIAL UNION
GROWTH OF THE NEW INTERESTS AND THE NEW HOPES THAT NOW ANIMATED HIM THE ENTIRE CHANGE WROUGHT IN HIS CONVICTIONS BY THE MEMORABLE EVENT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM FACE TO FACE WITH MISS GWILT
UNTIL HE HAD FIRST UNSPARINGLY EXPOSED THAT SUPERSTITION IN ITS WORST AND WEAKEST ASPECTS TO VIEW IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE HAD UNRESERVEDLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPULSE UNDER WHICH HE HAD LEFT ALLAN AT THE MERE
CARRIED THINGS WITH A HIGH HAND AND INSISTED ON TAKING HIS OWN COURSE IN HIS OWN SANITARIUM THERE IS NOT THE LEAST DOUBT THAT THE MISERABLE WOMAN HOWEVER SHE MIGHT HAVE COME BY HER DEATH WAS FOUND DEAD THAT A CORONER'S INQUEST INQUIRED INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES
HE HAD TAKEN ALLAN INTO THE ROOM AND HAD SHOWN HIM THE BOOKS ON THE SHELVES AND ALL THAT THE
HE WANTED AT FIRST IF THE LAWYERS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO LET HER OFF HE SAID TO HER AMONG OTHER THINGS YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON THE DROWNED MAN COMING BACK ALIVE AND HEARTY DID YOU MA'AM
HIS WATERY EYES SETTLED STEADILY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE VIEW OF THE STREET BEFORE HIM THE NEXT INSTANT HE STARTED HIS BREATH QUICKENED HE LEANED TREMBLING AND FLUSHING
TILL IT HAS COME TO BE LIKE MY CASE AT LAST IT MIGHT STARTLE ANY WOMAN TO SEE THIS AND EVEN THIS IS NOT THE WORST
IN MY SON'S NAME AND MY OWN FOR A HANDSOME COMPLIMENT TO THE FIRM
THE COACHMAN STARTS BY WAY OF THE COMMON AS A MATTER OF COURSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THAT IS TO SAY ON THE SIDE FURTHEST FROM THE GREAT HOUSE THE SUBURBS IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE
SHE HAD HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE AND HER CHILDREN ON THE SEAT OPPOSITE AT THE MOMENT WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING IN HIGH SPIRITS A SPARKLING LIGHT HEARTED HAPPY WOMAN AH MY LADY WHEN YOU WERE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER
AS FOR THE MATTER OF THE SERMON I MAY DESCRIBE IT AS A NARRATIVE OF MISSUS OLDERSHAW'S EXPERIENCE AMONG DILAPIDATED WOMEN PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED IN THE PIOUS AND PENITENTIAL STYLE YOU WILL ASK WHAT SORT OF AUDIENCE IT WAS PRINCIPALLY WOMEN AUGUSTUS AND
AND THE WISE MODERATION OF AGE ON HIS TONGUE MANY THANKS SIR HE SAID FOR THE ATTENTION YOU HAVE BESTOWED ON ME I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR DECISION AND I WISH YOU GOOD EVENING THIS TIME HIS INDICATIVE SNUFF BOX WAS NOT IN HIS HAND WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR
A VERY COMMON ONE BOTH AS TO CHRISTIAN AND SURNAME HAPPENED TO BE IDENTICALLY THE SAME THERE WAS MONEY TO BE GOT BY IT SORELY WANTED BY THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED
I SET THINGS RIGHT IN DUE COURSE OF TIME
I WON'T SAY A WORD AT THORPE AMBROSE I WON'T INDEED HE PAUSED AND CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY HE BURST OUT BRIGHTENING UP ON THE INSTANT WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE WEEK BEFORE US
I COULD BEAR IT IF I LOVED HIM LESS DEARLY THAN I DO I COULD CONQUER THE MISERY OF OUR ESTRANGEMENT IF HE ONLY SHOWED THE CHANGE IN HIM AS BRUTALLY AS OTHER MEN WOULD SHOW IT BUT THIS NEVER HAS HAPPENED NEVER WILL HAPPEN
BUT SUCH COLLECTIONS MAY BE BEYOND YOUR REACH AND I WILL ONLY REFER YOU TO A CASE IN YESTERDAY'S NEWSPAPER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE EXAMPLE OF RESOLUTION IN A WOMAN
I DECLINE EVEN TO THINK OF OUR MARRIAGE TILL MY MIND IS MADE EASY FIRST ON THE SUBJECT OF THE LAW BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAW
FAINTLY WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THE NECESSARY WORDS MY HEART BEATS SO YOU'LL KILL ME YOU POOR OLD DEAR SHE WHISPERED BACK WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER MANNER WITH AN EASY SATIRICAL TENDERNESS
I HAVE MADE NO OBJECTION I DON'T SAY YOU HAVE BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO LIKE THE NOTION OF IT FOR ALL THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE MIDWINTER WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE THIS TIME
IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW IDEA WOULD YOU MIND TRYING THE BLACKSMITH AT GRETNA GREEN NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION ANSWERED NEELIE INDIGNANTLY WOULD INDUCE ME TO BE MARRIED BY A BLACKSMITH DON'T BE OFFENDED PLEADED ALLAN
I MEANT IT FOR THE BEST LOTS OF PEOPLE IN OUR SITUATION HAVE TRIED THE BLACKSMITH AND FOUND HIM QUITE AS GOOD AS A CLERGYMAN AND A MOST AMIABLE MAN I BELIEVE INTO THE BARGAIN NEVER MIND
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I'LL GO TO LONDON
THE CONSENT OF THE FATHER HE REPEATED WITH ALL NEEDFUL SERIOUSNESS OF LOOK AND MANNER I COULDN'T EXACTLY SWEAR TO THAT COULD I
WHO INSISTED ON GOING WITH HIM FOLLOWED HER TO THE GRAVE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN INSCRIBED ON THE TOMBSTONE
WHICH HAS THROWN A CLOUD OVER THE OPENING OF HIS SANITARIUM AND OF THEIR UNDIMINISHED CONFIDENCE IN HIS INTEGRITY AND ABILITY AS A MEDICAL MAN WE LIVE AUGUSTUS IN AN AGE EMINENTLY FAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF ALL ROGUERY WHICH IS CAREFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES
WAS NO EFFORT TO HIM AND MIND
IT OUTDARES ALL DARING BUT IF I CAN ONLY NERVE MYSELF TO FACE ONE TERRIBLE NECESSITY IT IS TO BE DONE I MAY PERSONATE THE RICHLY PROVIDED WIDOW OF ALLAN ARMADALE OF THORPE AMBROSE
BESIDES THIS ROUNDABOUT WAY THAT ENDS IN A PUBLICATION AND A VOID INFERNAL GIBBERISH I COULD WRITE BETTER ENGLISH MYSELF WE ARE NOT AT THE END OF IT YET SAID NEELIE THE VOID IS NOTHING TO WHAT IS TO COME
SAID THE OTHER IN QUIET MEASURED TONES POOH A MERE FLIRTATION
DESERVES OUR SYMPATHY I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER CRIED ALLAN IMPULSIVELY
IS IN A MAN'S EYES THE MOST IRRESISTIBLE OF ALL MISTER BASHWOOD SHE EXCLAIMED IN LOUD CLEAR TONES INDICATIVE OF THE UTMOST ASTONISHMENT WHAT A SURPRISE TO FIND YOU HERE
WHO CARES FOR LOOKING MEAN IN HIS EYES AND YET
I WENT THROUGH MY DRESSES AND MY LINEN WHAT COULD BE MORE INNOCENT CHILDREN GO THROUGH THEIR DRESSES AND THEIR LINEN IT WAS SUCH A LONG SUMMER DAY AND I WAS SO TIRED OF MYSELF I WENT TO MY BOXES NEXT
IN THE WEAKNESS OF THE MOMENT FOR IT WAS NOTHING ELSE I WAS ON THE POINT OF MATCHING HER PETTY SPITEFULNESS BY SPITEFULNESS QUITE AS PETTY ON MY SIDE I HAD ACTUALLY GOT AS FAR AS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET
AND LED HER AWAY GENTLY AMONG THE TREES A NICE POSITION TO FIND ME IN IF ANY OF THE SCANDAL MONGERS OF THE TOWN HAD HAPPENED TO BE WALKING IN THAT DIRECTION MY DEAR MISS MILROY SAYS I
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF A MAN AT HIS AGE FALLING IN LOVE AND WHO WOULD EVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE MISCHIEF THAT WOMAN'S BEAUTY HAS DONE COULD HAVE REACHED AS FAR IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION AS OUR SUPERANNUATED OLD CLERK GOOD BY FOR THE PRESENT MY DEAR BOY
IF YOU ONLY KNEW HIM HE'S ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY MEN WHO APPEAR ONCE OR TWICE IN A CENTURY THE SORT OF MAN WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE IF YOU TRY ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY TO HIM PUTTING IT SHORT IS
AND HER HEAD SANK ON ALLAN'S BOSOM AS SHE TRIED TO SAY GOOD BY
WHEN THERE WERE ROADS THAT LED TO IT AND VILLAGES IN ITS NEIGHBORHOOD AND BOATS EMPLOYED ON IT AND PLEASURE PARTIES VISITING IT SO AGAIN HE HAD WAITED TO VINDICATE THE FIRMER RESOLUTION WITH WHICH HE LOOKED TO THE FUTURE
THE CONSENT REQUIRED BY THIS ACT IS THAT OF THE FATHER AT THOSE LAST FORMIDABLE WORDS ALLAN CAME TO A FULL STOP
NO VEXING CARES NO BODING DOUBTS TROUBLED HIM NOW THE RENT DAY WHICH HE HAD ONCE DREADED HAD COME AND GONE HARMLESSLY A FRIENDLIER UNDERSTANDING HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN ALLAN AND HIS TENANTS
NOT A HARD WORD NOT A HARD LOOK ESCAPES HIM IT IS ONLY AT NIGHT WHEN I HEAR HIM SIGHING IN HIS SLEEP AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE HIM DREAMING IN THE MORNING HOURS THAT I KNOW HOW HOPELESSLY I AM LOSING THE LOVE HE ONCE FELT FOR ME HE HIDES
HAD NOT TURNED UP ALIVE AND WELL IN THE NICK OF TIME TO CONFRONT HER THE SCENE TOOK PLACE AT THE LAWYER'S OFFICE AND CAME OUT IN THE EVIDENCE AT THE POLICE COURT THE WOMAN WAS HANDSOME AND THE SAILOR WAS A GOOD NATURED MAN
I'LL GO OVER THE BACKS OF TEN THOUSAND CRIED ALLAN WARMLY
I WON'T BREATHE YOUR NAME OR YOUR FATHER'S I'LL DESCRIBE YOU AS A YOUNG LADY TO WHOM I AM DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED AND IF MY FRIEND THE CLERK ASKS WHERE YOU LIVE I'LL SAY THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND OR THE WEST OF IRELAND
UNDER MISTER ARMADALE'S NAME IS MORE THAN MISTER ARMADALE HIMSELF KNOWS THE POINT WAS NOT TOUCHED AT THE INQUEST FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE INQUEST ONLY CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER DEATH MISTER ARMADALE AT HIS FRIEND'S REQUEST
I KNOW ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE LEFT ENGLAND THROUGH THE LETTERS WHICH HE WRITES TO MIDWINTER AND WHICH MIDWINTER SHOWS TO ME HE HAS BEEN WRECKED TO BEGIN WITH
I AM THINKING SERIOUSLY OF IT AT THIS MOMENT SAID ALLAN I CAN'T BE HAPPY I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER UPON MY SOUL I WORSHIP THE VERY GROUND SHE TREADS ON HOW LONG HIS VOICE FALTERED AND HE STOPPED
PRETTY FREELY AND I THOUGHT IT HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO GIVE HIM A CAUTION IT'S ALWAYS THE WAY WITH THOSE QUIET ADDLE HEADED MEN WHEN THEY DO ONCE WAKE UP THERE'S NO REASONING WITH THEIR OBSTINACY AND NO QUIETING THEIR VIOLENCE
AT THE BOTTOM OF MORE OF THIS MISCHIEF THAN WE SHALL EVER FIND OUT AND TO HAVE PROFITED BY THE SELF IMPOSED SILENCE OF MISTER MIDWINTER AND MISTER ARMADALE AS ROGUES PERPETUALLY PROFIT BY THE MISFORTUNES AND NECESSITIES OF HONEST MEN
INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER HOUSES AND DIED AWAY ON THE BARREN OPEN GROUND INTO AN ATROPHY OF SKELETON COTTAGES BUILDERS HEREABOUTS APPEARED TO HAVE UNIVERSALLY ABANDONED THEIR WORK IN THE FIRST STAGE OF ITS CREATION
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR WHAT IT IS MISTER ARMADALE IF YOU PLEASE SAID ALLAN WITH ALL MY HEART SIR THIS IS THE POINT I ATTACH CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IF NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE
WOMEN ARE SO PROVERBIALLY READY TO LISTEN TO REASON AND THEY ARE SO UNIVERSALLY DISPOSED TO ALTER THEIR OPINIONS OF EACH OTHER ON APPLICATION ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE WOMAN THINKS THAT ANOTHER WOMAN HAS DESTROYED HER PROSPECT OF MAKING A GOOD MARRIAGE
A YOUNG LADY WHO IS A NEAR NEIGHBOR OF YOURS SIR SHALL I MENTION THE NAME IN CONFIDENCE MISS MILROY ALLAN STARTED AND CHANGED COLOR MISS MILROY HE REPEATED CAN SHE BE CONCERNED IN THIS MISERABLE BUSINESS
I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF IT HE SAID AFTER WAITING A LITTLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER IT'S TOO LATE TO MAKE OBJECTIONS PROCEEDED ALLAN I REALLY MEAN IT WHEN I TELL YOU I'M IN LOVE WITH HER A FORTNIGHT SINCE YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH MISS MILROY
HE BURST ECSTATICALLY INTO THOSE EXTRAVAGANT WORDS WITH A CONCENTRATED INTENSITY OF DELIGHT IN UTTERING THEM THAT ACTUALLY SHOOK HIS FEEBLE FIGURE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
ASKED ALLAN ONLY TELL ME HOW BY GIVING ME YOUR AUTHORITY SIR TO PROTECT HER FROM MISS GWILT HAVING FIRED THAT SHOT POINTBLANK AT HIS CLIENT THE WISE LAWYER WAITED A LITTLE TO LET IT TAKE ITS EFFECT BEFORE HE SAID ANY MORE
THE MOMENT HIS CLOTHES ARE CLEANED AGAIN HE FALLS BACK INTO HIS FAVORITE DELUSION AND STRUTS ABOUT BEFORE THE CHURCH GATES IN THE CHARACTER OF A BRIDEGROOM WAITING FOR MISS GWILT
THE WIDELY DISCORDANT ELEMENTS OF THE GROTESQUE AND THE TERRIBLE WERE FORCED TOGETHER BY THAT SUBTLE LAW OF CONTRAST WHICH IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF MORTAL LIFE
HIS PAST EXISTENCE HAD DISCIPLINED HIM TO BEAR DISASTER AND INSULT AS FEW HAPPIER MEN COULD HAVE BORNE THEM
HALF PAST TWO ONLY HALF PAST TWO OH THE DREADFUL WEARINESS OF THESE LONG SUMMER DAYS
SHE GOT NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER MISSUS MILROY DECLARED SHE WAS TOO ILL TO ENTER ON THE SUBJECT
I LOOKED OVER THE LARGE BOX FIRST WHICH I USUALLY LEAVE OPEN AND THEN I TRIED THE SMALL BOX WHICH I ALWAYS KEEP LOCKED FROM ONE THING TO THE OTHER I CAME AT LAST TO THE BUNDLE OF LETTERS AT THE BOTTOM
SHALL YOU BE VERY LONG AWAY I'LL BE OFF TO DAY SAID ALLAN BY THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK TRAIN AND I'LL BE BACK TO MORROW IF I AND MY FRIEND THE CLERK CAN SETTLE IT ALL IN TIME
REPLIED PLANCHET SOMEWHAT HUMILIATED BUT A COUNTRY BOX AH AH I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE MODEST NO MONSIEUR LE BARON I SPEAK THE PLAIN TRUTH I HAVE ROOMS FOR A COUPLE OF FRIENDS THAT'S ALL
IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
WHICH IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES IS FOR ME A SUFFICIENTLY PLEASING PICTURE OF WAR ON A SMALL SCALE
BY THAT RIGHT YOU DESERVE TO BE WARNED ABOUT HER AS SOME DAY OR ANOTHER I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO DISMISS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FROM MY SERVICE
SO THAT MONSIEUR LE BARON CONTINUED THE GROCER
I ASSURE YOU IT IS VERY CURIOUS HARDLY A DAY PASSES THAT SOME ONE IS NOT BURIED THERE FOR FONTAINEBLEAU IS BY NO MEANS AN INCONSIDERABLE PLACE SOMETIMES WE SEE YOUNG GIRLS CLOTHED IN WHITE CARRYING BANNERS
NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL AS MY FOREST AT BERRY PLANCHET OPENED HIS EYES VERY WIDE
WILL SIRE WITH REGARD TO SWEET DISHES I ONLY RECOGNIZE PASTRY AND EVEN THAT SHOULD BE RATHER SOLID ALL THESE FROTHY SUBSTANCES SWELL THE STOMACH AND OCCUPY A SPACE WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE TOO PRECIOUS TO BE SO BADLY TENANTED
PORTHOS FANCIES HIMSELF AT LA ROCHELLE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AS THEY RETURNED FREIGHTED WITH BOTTLES
AND ABOUT TWO OTHERS AS WELL SAID THE LADY WITH A VERY DECIDED FLEMISH ACCENT MADAME IS DUTCH INQUIRED D'ARTAGNAN PORTHOS CURLED HIS MUSTACHE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WAS NOT LOST UPON D'ARTAGNAN WHO NOTICED EVERYTHING I AM FROM ANTWERP SAID THE LADY
AND YET IT WAS HE THE KING HIMSELF WHO WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF THIS IGNOMINY A BITTER SMILE THE ONLY SYMPTOM OF ANGER WHICH DURING THIS LONG CONFLICT HAD PASSED ACROSS THE ANGELIC FACE APPEARED UPON HER LIPS
AND SO SHE SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT FORWARD IN EAGER EXPECTATION TOWARDS THE DOOR
HE TOOK BY ASSAULT PORTHOS'S ROOM WHICH WAS NEXT TO HIS OWN THE WORTHY PORTHOS WAS SLEEPING WITH A NOISE LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IN THE DIM OBSCURITY OF THE ROOM HIS GIGANTIC FRAME WAS PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED
AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
AND NEVER ABANDONS THOSE WHO NEITHER FORGET NOR ABANDON HIM IT IS TO HIM ALONE THAT WE MUST SACRIFICE OURSELVES AND THEREUPON COULD ANY ONE HAVE GAZED INTO THE RECESSES OF THAT CHAMBER THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THE POOR DESPAIRING GIRL ADOPT A FINAL RESOLUTION
WHAT DID SHE NOW CARE FOR MADAME AGAIN SHE SANK DOWN HER HEAD SUPPORTED BY HER PRIE DIEU CHAIR IT WAS MADAME AGITATED ANGRY AND THREATENING BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO HER
I DO UNTIL I HAVE A PROOF OF IT FORGIVE ME MADAME BUT SHE HAS GIVEN ME HER WORD
THAT IS A DISH I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO TASTE MONSIEUR DU VALLON IS IT POSSIBLE A WHOLE LAMB ABSOLUTELY AN ENTIRE LAMB SIRE
AT YOUR MAJESTY'S PRESENT HAPPY AGE SAID PORTHOS IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE MISTAKE HE HAD MADE I WAS IN THE MUSKETEERS AND NOTHING COULD EVER SATISFY ME THEN YOUR MAJESTY HAS AN EXCELLENT APPETITE AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF MENTIONING
HE MURMURED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL HE HAD LEARNT EVERYTHING
YOU SHOULD NOT CALL HER MADAME SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHY NOT ASKED PLANCHET BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE HER SEEM OLDER EVERY TIME YOU CALL HER SO WELL
AH PLANCHET MY FRIEND RETURNED D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE GETTING AMBITIOUS
OF COURSE DO YOU SUPPOSE I SHALL ALWAYS BE AMENABLE TO THE TEARS AND PROTESTATIONS OF THE KING NO NO MY HOUSE SHALL NO LONGER BE MADE A CONVENIENCE FOR SUCH PRACTICES BUT YOU TREMBLE YOU CANNOT STAND
AND TRUCHEN WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A MOST BEWITCHING SMILE THE SPARKLING WINE OF ANJOU VERY SOON PRODUCED A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE THREE COMPANIONS
HE IS ALWAYS IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS
OH HOW SHE WOULD DEVOUR HIS LETTER HOW EAGER SHE WOULD BE TO ANSWER IT AND WHEN THE MESSENGER WHO HAD BROUGHT IT HAD LEFT HER HOW SHE WOULD KISS IT READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN PRESS TO HER HEART THE LUCKY PAPER WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER EASE OF MIND
A MEAL INTO A REGULAR FEAST FRESH BUTTER SALT BEEF ANCHOVIES TUNNY A SHOPFUL OF PLANCHET'S COMMODITIES FOWLS VEGETABLES SALAD FISH FROM THE POND AND THE RIVER GAME FROM THE FOREST ALL THE PRODUCE IN FACT OF THE PROVINCE
EVEN IF IT WERE A THIRD PERSON HOW OPENLY SHE WOULD SPEAK TO HIM THE ROYAL PRESENCE WOULD NOT BE THERE TO FREEZE HER WORDS UPON HER TONGUE AND THEN NO SUSPICIOUS FEELING WOULD REMAIN A MOMENT LONGER IN THE KING'S HEART EVERYTHING WITH LA VALLIERE
WHICH WAS BITING HER FINGERS AND HANGING BY THE LACE OF HER COLLAR MADAME SEEMED PLUNGED IN DEEP THOUGHT SO DEEP INDEED THAT IT REQUIRED BOTH MONTALAIS AND RAOUL'S VOICE TO DISTURB HER FROM HER REVERIE YOUR HIGHNESS SENT FOR ME
AND WHICH HAVE BROUGHT HER IN TEN THOUSAND BRAVO PLANCHET SHE IS FREE AND WELL OFF SHE HAS A COW A MAID SERVANT AND OLD CELESTIN AT HER ORDERS SHE MENDS MY LINEN KNITS MY WINTER STOCKINGS SHE ONLY SEES ME EVERY FORTNIGHT
PORTHOS BOWED WITH A REVERENCE WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF
SMILING ALL THE WHILE WITH THE SAME AFFABLE EXPRESSION AS SOON AS PORTHOS HAD PLACED HIM ON THE GROUND THE LAD'S LEGS SO SHOOK UNDER HIM THAT HE FELL BACK UPON SOME SACKS OF CORKS BUT NOTICING THE GIANT'S GENTLENESS OF MANNER HE VENTURED AGAIN AND SAID
AND EXCEEDINGLY UNHAPPY IN FACT D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WE SAY FOR WE MUST CALL HIM BY HIS NAME TO REMIND OUR READERS OF HIS EXISTENCE D'ARTAGNAN WE REPEAT
AND DRESSED IN AN OLD STABLE SUIT OF CLOTHES THE PEASANT
WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO SO ARDENTLY WISHED FOR YET HAD DREADED SO MUCH HE REPLIED I LEFT MADAME A DEAR FRIEND IN GOOD HEALTH AND ON MY RETURN I FIND HIM VERY ILL
AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
IT IS THE FAULT OF OTHERS WHO WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO LOVE YOU AND THEN IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SHE REFLECTED UPON IT AND ALSO THE MORE SHE REFLECTED LOUIS APPEARED TO HER TO BE LESS GUILTY IN FACT HE WAS IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING
AND YOUR INSTINCTIVE KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY OF DISPOSITION INDUCE YOU TO BE CAREFUL AND CONSIDERATE AS TO YOUR MANNER OF CONVEYING IT WILL YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THROW THIS KIND FORBEARANCE ASIDE I AM ABLE TO BEAR EVERYTHING AND I AM LISTENING
AND THEN TOO WE SEE SOME OF THE OFFICERS OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD I SHOULD NOT LIKE THAT SAID PORTHOS THERE IS NOT MUCH AMUSEMENT IN IT AT ALL EVENTS SAID D'ARTAGNAN
LA VALLIERE'S FIXED AND WILD GAZE SHOWED HOW COMPLETE HER FORGETFULNESS OR IGNORANCE WAS THE QUEEN RECOMMENDED YOU CONTINUED MADAME TO CONDUCT YOURSELF IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NO ONE COULD BE JUSTIFIED IN SPREADING ANY REPORTS ABOUT YOU
BETWEEN THE TWO A SMALL DOOR WITH A PORCH SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF PILLARS FORMED THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE THE DOOR WAS GAINED BY A STEP RAISED A LITTLE FROM THE GROUND
IT IS FROM HEAVEN SHE THOUGHT THAT I EXPECT EVERYTHING IT IS FROM HEAVEN I OUGHT TO EXPECT EVERYTHING AND SHE LOOKED AT HER CRUCIFIX WITH A DEVOTION FULL OF TENDER LOVE THERE SHE SAID HANGS BEFORE ME A MASTER WHO NEVER FORGETS
WHAT IS THERE FOR ME TO BE SATISFIED OR DISSATISFIED ABOUT MADAME
IT WAS NOW ABOUT HALF PAST TEN HE WOULD EITHER COME TO HER OR WRITE TO HER
IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
FOR WHAT IN DEED IS SUCH A WOUND AFTER ALL RAOUL STARTED ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE IS RETURNING TO IT WHAT DID YOU SAY SHE INQUIRED I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING MADAME
PIERREFONDS I HAVE ONLY ONE COW PLANCHET HASTENED TO SAY MODESTLY AND I HAVE THIRTY SAID PORTHOS OR RATHER I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY I HAVE WHEN THE TWO CAVALIERS HAD ENTERED PLANCHET FASTENED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM
AND YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO ME THEN IN A MUCH MORE FAMILIAR MANNER THAN YOU DO NOW CERTAINLY CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE SAID SO FORMERLY REPLIED THE GOOD NATURED PORTHOS WITH AN EMBARRASSMENT FULL OF DELICACY BUT FORMERLY
TOOK BOTH HIS FRIENDS BY THE HAND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU OVER THE HOUSE HE SAID
FOR INSTANCE THAT HE WOULD BITE IS VERY LIKELY BUT I SHOULD NOT HESITATE ANY MORE TO HESITATE TO DOUBT BETTER FAR TO DIE THE NEXT MOMENT RAOUL WAS IN MADAME'S PRESENCE
THIS IS VERY FINE I ADMIT TO KNEEL AND PRAY AND MAKE A PRETENSE OF BEING RELIGIOUS BUT HOWEVER SUBMISSIVE YOU MAY BE IN YOUR ADDRESS TO HEAVEN IT IS DESIRABLE THAT YOU SHOULD PAY SOME LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO REIGN AND RULE HERE BELOW
FLOATING BEFORE HER VISION SHE HEARD TOO MINGLED TOGETHER IN HER DEAFENED EARS WORDS OF MENACE AND WORDS OF FOND AFFECTION
RECOMMENDED A NEW DESCENT INTO THE CELLAR AND AS PLANCHET NO LONGER WALKED WITH THE STEADINESS OF A WELL TRAINED FOOT SOLDIER
A POOR FRANCISCAN MENDICANT FRIAR REPLIED THE LATTER WHO HAD NOT EVEN A DOG TO LOVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS LAST RESTING PLACE IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
WHICH HE DESPAIRED OF BEING ABLE FULLY TO REALIZE THE KING THEREFORE WAS SEATED ALONE AT A SMALL SEPARATE TABLE WHICH LIKE THE DESK OF A PRESIDENT OVERLOOKED THE ADJOINING TABLES
HER THOUGHTS HAD ALMOST CEASED TO HOLD COMMUNION WITH THINGS OF THE WORLD AND WHEN SHE SAW THE PALE VIOLET TINTS OF EARLY DAWN
HE COULD ACT COULD MOVE ABOUT COULD COME TO HER WHILE SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT WAIT AND THE POOR GIRL WAITED AND WAITED WITH BREATHLESS ANXIETY FOR SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT THE KING WOULD NOT COME
THE BEST WAY IN THAT CASE SAID PORTHOS IS TO EAT NO SUPPER AT ALL AND YET I AM VERY HUNGRY I ADMIT AND EVERYTHING LOOKS AND SMELLS MOST INVITINGLY AS IF APPEALING TO ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
THE FOREMAN CLASPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER THE TWO OTHERS GOT UNDER THE COUNTERS FEARING PORTHOS MIGHT HAVE A TASTE FOR HUMAN FLESH WE SHALL ONLY TAKE A SORT OF SNACK HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
HERE IS INDEED A MODEL OF GASTRONOMY IT WAS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT OUR FATHERS WHO SO WELL KNEW WHAT GOOD LIVING WAS
LA VALLIERE RAISED HER HEAD PAINFULLY IN TOKEN OF RESPECT NOT LONG SINCE CONTINUED MADAME A CERTAIN RECOMMENDATION WAS ADDRESSED TO YOU I BELIEVE
LIKE A KIND GOOD HOUSEKEEPER IT WAS STILL PERFECTLY DARK THEN
AND HOLDING UP HER HEAD PERTLY IN THE AIR PRECEDED HIM TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS WHERE HE WAS AT ONCE INTRODUCED WELL HE THOUGHT THIS DAY WILL PASS AWAY WITHOUT MY LEARNING ANYTHING GUICHE SHOWED TOO MUCH CONSIDERATION FOR MY FEELINGS
AND HE UNHESITATINGLY EMBRACED THE LADY IN QUESTION NOT HOWEVER
WHICH IS AS AGREEABLE TO THE EYE AS IT IS EXQUISITE TO THE PALATE AND PORTHOS FINISHED BY SMACKING HIS LIPS THE KING OPENED HIS EYES WITH DELIGHT AND WHILE CUTTING SOME OF THE
FOR THERE IS ALWAYS THAT BUSTLING AND NOISY INN WHICH IS A VERY DISAGREEABLE NEIGHBOR I HAD FOUR WINDOWS HERE BUT I BRICKED UP TWO LET US GO ON SAID D'ARTAGNAN
REPEATED RAOUL MADAME SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF SHE WERE JUST AWAKENING AND THEN SAID
WHEN YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE BOTH WERE THERE A CERTAIN ARAB
AND A VERY PRETTY NAME TOO SAID PORTHOS
WHAT IS IT INQUIRED PORTHOS LOOKING ALL ROUND HIM AS IF IN SEARCH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ANNOYED PLANCHET AND DESIROUS OF FREEING HIM FROM IT WHY FORMERLY SAID THE GROCER YOU USED TO CALL ME PLANCHET QUITE SHORT
VERY GOOD SAID PORTHOS AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE BEGAN TO EAT WITH A CERTAIN WELL BRED ENTHUSIASM
OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF THE CHARMS OF ENGLAND AT ALL EVENTS INTERRUPTED RAOUL I TELL YOU I WARN YOU THAT WHEREVER PEOPLE MAY BE I KNOW NOT HOW MADAME IS SURE TO HAVE EYES AND EARS OPEN
OH THEY SHALL HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE GENTLY GENTLY MY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE ARE GETTING ON A LITTLE TOO FAST A FEW OATS AND A GOOD BED NOTHING MORE SOME BRAN AND WATER FOR MY HORSE SAID PORTHOS
I AM NOT VERY DESIROUS YOU CAN EASILY BELIEVE OF BEING DISMISSED OR THROWN IN TO THE BASTILE LET US TALK I TELL YOU OR RATHER DO NOT LET US TALK AT ALL
IF THE KING DID NOT COME AT LEAST HE WOULD WRITE IT WAS A SECOND CHANCE A CHANCE LESS DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY THAN THE OTHER BUT WHICH WOULD SHOW AN AFFECTION JUST AS STRONG ONLY MORE TIMID IN ITS NATURE
HE WILL VERY SOON HAVE NONE AT ALL TO DO IF THIS SORT OF THING CONTINUES GRUMBLED THE FOREMAN WHO HAD PLANCHET'S WORD THAT HE SHOULD BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE MIDST OF HIS DESPAIR
AND THE KING'S DESPAIR ON HIS RETURN SHE TOLD HIM OF HIS INDULGENCE TO HERSELF AND THE TERRIBLE WORD WITH WHICH THE OUTRAGED PRINCESS THE HUMILIATED COQUETTE HAD QUASHED THE ROYAL ANGER RAOUL STOOD WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN
WHEREABOUTS MONSIEUR AT YOUR CHATEAU OH MONSIEUR LE BARON I HAVE NEITHER CHATEAU NOR PARK NOR MEADOWS NOR WOODS WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THEN INQUIRED PORTHOS AND WHY DO YOU CALL IT A COUNTRY SEAT I DID NOT CALL IT A COUNTRY SEAT MONSIEUR LE BARON
HENRIETTA MORE CHARMING THAN EVER WAS HALF LYING HALF RECLINING IN HER ARMCHAIR HER SMALL FEET UPON AN EMBROIDERED VELVET CUSHION SHE WAS PLAYING WITH A KITTEN WITH LONG SILKY FUR
YES I SENT FOR YOU SO YOU HAVE RETURNED FROM ENGLAND YES MADAME AND AM AT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS THANK YOU LEAVE US MONTALAIS AND THE LATTER IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM
SHE HAD INSPIRED THE QUEEN WITH THAT MORTAL JEALOUSY WHICH IS THE STINGING SCORPION AT THE HEEL OF EVERY WOMAN'S HAPPINESS MADAME IN A WORD IN HER ATTEMPTS TO CURE A WOUNDED PRIDE FOUND THAT HER HEART HAD BECOME DEEPLY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED
IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
YES HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MODE OF REASONING
OF COURSE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WELL WELL THEN THE WORD DISTRESSES ME BEYOND MEASURE TELL ME WHY YOU ARE DISTRESSED PLANCHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN ASLEEP
RAOUL WHOSE HEAD DROPPED LIKE A BLOSSOM CUT DOWN BY THE REAPER MADE AN ALMOST SUPERHUMAN EFFORT TO SMILE AS HE REPLIED WITH THE GREATEST GENTLENESS
HAS BEEN ABLE TO REACH ME HENRIETTA WAS AFFECTED BY HIS EXTREME PALLOR HIS GENTLENESS AND HIS GREAT COURAGE THE PRINCIPAL FEELING IN HER HEART AT THAT MOMENT WAS AN EAGER DESIRE TO HEAR THE NATURE OF THE REMEMBRANCE
FEELING PERSUADED THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF AFFINITY BETWEEN MADAME'S SENTIMENTS AND HIS OWN IN FACT EVERY ONE AT COURT OF ANY PERCEPTION AT ALL
WHILE THE TWO WINE BIBBERS
AND SO NOT ONLY DID THE KING NOT LOVE HER BUT HE DESPISED HER WHOM EVERY ONE ILL TREATED HE DESPISED HER TO THE EXTENT EVEN OF ABANDONING HER TO THE SHAME OF AN EXPULSION WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING AN IGNOMINIOUS SENTENCE PASSED ON HER
MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I AM ONE OF THOSE GOOD HUMORED SORT OF MEN WHOM HEAVEN CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING A CERTAIN SPAN OF DAYS
WITH IMPERTURBABLE SELF POSSESSION I HAVE HEARD HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF YOURS HE IS INDEED MADAME WELL IT IS QUITE TRUE HE HAS BEEN WOUNDED BUT HE IS BETTER NOW OH
SIRE I BELIEVE THAT FROM MY OWN PROVINCE AS EVERYWHERE ELSE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING IS SENT TO PARIS FOR YOUR MAJESTY'S USE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO NOT EAT LAMB IN THE SAME WAY YOUR MAJESTY DOES AH AH
PRESENTLY SAID PORTHOS PHLEGMATICALLY I SHALL COME TO THAT BY AND BY IN FACT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE IT CAME TO THE BOAR'S TURN FOR THE KING SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN URGING ON HIS GUEST
THE KING HAD NOW ARRIVED AT THE ENTREMENTS BUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO CONTINUED TO PLAY HIS PART IN THE BEST MANNER
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL SHE SAID THE KING LOVES HER HE REPLIED BUT YOU SEEM TO THINK SHE DOES NOT LOVE HIM ALAS MADAME I WAS THINKING OF THE TIME WHEN SHE LOVED ME
THEN THE SERVANT WHO CARVES REMOVES THE FAT WITH A SPOON WHICH I HAVE HAD EXPRESSLY MADE FOR THAT PURPOSE WHERE DO YOU RESIDE INQUIRED THE KING AT PIERREFONDS SIRE AT PIERREFONDS
THAT I AM A POOR UNREMEMBERED OUTCAST WHO HAS THIS MOMENT ARRIVED FROM ENGLAND THERE HAVE ROLLED SO MANY STORMY WAVES BETWEEN MYSELF AND THOSE I LEFT BEHIND ME HERE THAT THE RUMOR OF NONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR HIGHNESS REFERS TO
AND HE LED HIS TWO GUESTS TO A WINDOW AH SAID D'ARTAGNAN THIS IS THE RUE DE LYON YES I HAVE TWO WINDOWS ON THIS SIDE A PALTRY INSIGNIFICANT VIEW
AND WRAPPED HERSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A MANTLE AS SHE WENT ALONG SHE REACHED THE WICKET AT THE VERY MOMENT THE GUARD OF THE MUSKETEERS OPENED THE GATE TO ADMIT THE FIRST RELIEF GUARD BELONGING TO ONE OF THE SWISS REGIMENTS
WERE WE BORN TO BE AFRAID I NEVER KNEW YOU AFRAID IF YOU'LL ONLY TRUST ME HOW LITTLE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
BUT IF IT WAS AN AFFECTATION SHE WAS AT A LOSS TO SEE WHAT HER HUSBAND AFFECTED SHE COULD ONLY DIMLY PERCEIVE THAT HE HAD MORE TRADITIONS THAN SHE SUPPOSED IT HAD BECOME HER HABIT TO BE SO CAREFUL AS TO WHAT SHE SAID TO HIM THAT
SHE GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER HE WITH A HAND ON EACH KNEE LEANED FORWARD LOOKING DEEPLY INTO HER FACE THE TWILIGHT SEEMED TO DARKEN ROUND THEM I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU HE REPEATED I'VE SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO TROUBLE YOU
THAT WOULD GET ME BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER
IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT SHE PARTOOK OF THIS REFRESHMENT IN SPITE OF HER HUSBAND'S AVERSION TO IT THAT IS PARTOOK OF IT AS SHE FLATTERED HERSELF DISCREETLY SHE HAD NOT AS YET UNDERTAKEN TO ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO HIS WISHES
WITH THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DELAY
HE THINKS I'VE NOT HAD ENOUGH SAID PANSY BUT I HAVE THE LADIES ARE VERY KIND TO ME AND THE LITTLE GIRLS COME TO SEE ME THERE ARE SOME VERY LITTLE ONES SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN THEN MY ROOM
IF TOUCHETT HAD NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THE SAME I HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT YOU AT YOUR COUSIN'S FUNERAL TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU CAN'T DECEIVE ME ANY MORE FOR GOD'S SAKE BE HONEST WITH A MAN WHO'S SO HONEST WITH YOU YOU'RE THE MOST UNHAPPY OF WOMEN
WHAT IS IT THAT HOLDS US WHAT IS IT THAT HAS THE SMALLEST RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SUCH A QUESTION AS THIS SUCH A QUESTION IS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND TO SAY THAT IS TO SETTLE IT
SHE CONSIDERED WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH THAT A MORALITY DIFFERING FROM HER OWN MUST BE INFERIOR TO IT
YES HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND PANSY ANSWERED THAT'S WHAT I LIKE HIM FOR WHY THEN IS THE DIFFICULTY SO GREAT I'VE ALWAYS FELT SURE OF HIS KNOWING THAT I DON'T WANT WHAT DID YOU SAY I SHOULD DO TO ENCOURAGE HIM
HAD ONLY BEEN THE DESIRE TO LEAVE HER AT LIBERTY PANSY BENT FORWARD RAISED HER FACE NEARER AND NEARER AND WITH A LITTLE MURMUR WHICH EVIDENTLY EXPRESSED A DEEP LONGING ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD GREATLY WISHED HER TO SPEAK AND THAT SHE BEGGED HER TO ADVISE HER NOW
HER CHARACTER HAD REVEALED ITSELF
THE WEATHER HAD CHANGED TO FAIR THE DAY ONE OF THE LAST OF THE TREACHEROUS MAY TIME WAS WARM AND WINDLESS AND THE AIR HAD THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE HAWTHORN AND THE BLACKBIRD IF IT WAS SAD TO THINK OF POOR TOUCHETT
I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU'VE NOT GONE I'M NOT HERE FOR LONG YOU KNOW ISABEL SAID WITH A CERTAIN EAGERNESS I SUPPOSE NOT BUT I HOPE IT'S FOR SOME WEEKS YOU CAME TO ENGLAND SOONER THAN A THAN YOU THOUGHT
WHEN ONE REALLY THINKS OF IT THE COOL INSOLENCE OF THAT PERFORMANCE WAS SOMETHING RARE HE COMES AND LOOKS AT ONE'S DAUGHTER AS IF SHE WERE A SUITE OF APARTMENTS
WITH THE DISPERSAL OF THE LITTLE GROUP HE DISAPPEARED AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAME TO SPEAK TO HER THOUGH SEVERAL SPOKE TO MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS HENRIETTA STACKPOLE HENRIETTA HAD BEEN CRYING RALPH HAD SAID TO ISABEL
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ECONOMICAL HABITS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP SAND WHICH SHE WAS NOW MORE CAREFUL THAN EVER TO OBSERVE SO THAT THE ROOM WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A COUPLE OF LOGS THE ROOMS IN PALAZZO ROCCANERA WERE AS SPACIOUS AS THEY WERE NUMEROUS
THE IDEA OF VIOLATING THEM FILLED HER WITH SHAME AS WELL AS WITH DREAD FOR ON GIVING HERSELF AWAY SHE HAD LOST SIGHT OF THIS CONTINGENCY IN THE PERFECT BELIEF THAT HER HUSBAND'S INTENTIONS WERE AS GENEROUS AS HER OWN
IF THAT WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH AND I HAVE MYSELF SO LITTLE MONEY WHY SHOULD I LOOK FOR A FORTUNE YOUR HAVING SO LITTLE IS A REASON FOR LOOKING FOR MORE WITH WHICH ISABEL WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE DIMNESS OF THE ROOM SHE FELT AS IF HER FACE WERE HIDEOUSLY INSINCERE
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME IN PARIS OH THEY WERE VERY FRANK ABOUT IT BUT THEY HADN'T SEEN HER MY DEAR FRIEND YOU DESERVE TO SUCCEED SAID ISABEL VERY KINDLY YOU SAY THAT SO SADLY THAT IT'S THE SAME AS IF YOU SAID I SHOULDN'T
IT MADE LILY SO FIDGETY AND SHE ASKED SUCH IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS ISABEL WATCHED THE TRAIN MOVE AWAY SHE KISSED HER HAND TO THE ELDER OF HER SMALL NEPHEWS
THE GIRL EXCLAIMED AS IF SHE WERE PRAYING TO THE MADONNA I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO ATTEMPT IT SAID THE MADONNA WITH UNUSUAL FRIGIDITY
BUT IT EVIDENTLY MADE HIM FEEL MORE SO TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN RATHER A LOUD VOICE BALANCING HIMSELF A LITTLE COMPLACENTLY ON HIS TOES AND LOOKING ALL ROUND THE COLISEUM AS IF IT WERE FILLED WITH AN AUDIENCE SUDDENLY ISABEL SAW HIM CHANGE COLOUR
A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
AND A STRANGE EXQUISITE INTIMATION THAT SHE COULD PROVE IT BETTER BY REMAINING SINGLE THAN EVEN BY MARRYING HIM YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE A BETTER MARRIAGE SAID ISABEL MISTER ROSIER'S FORTUNE IS NOT AT ALL LARGE
BUT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ME I DIDN'T MEAN TO LAUGH SAID ISABEL I LAUGH VERY SELDOM NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO AWAY I FEEL VERY SAFE ROSIER DECLARED WITHOUT MOVING THIS MIGHT BE
AND IT WAS WITH AN EFFORT IN A MOMENT THAT SHE ANSWERED HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP ME SHE ASKED IN A LOW TONE AS IF SHE WERE TAKING WHAT HE HAD SAID SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ENQUIRY IN CONFIDENCE BY INDUCING YOU TO TRUST ME
AND THE GOOD SISTER GAVE A KNOWING LAUGH SHE LED ISABEL OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH SEVERAL CORRIDORS AND UP A LONG STAIRCASE ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE SOLID AND BARE LIGHT AND CLEAN
THE EARLY DUSK OF A NOVEMBER AFTERNOON HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN THE STREET LAMPS IN THE THICK BROWN AIR LOOKED WEAK AND RED
SHE OPENED THE DOOR WITH A HAND AS GENTLE AS IF SHE WERE LIFTING A VEIL FROM THE FACE OF THE DEAD AND SAW MISSUS TOUCHETT SITTING MOTIONLESS AND UPRIGHT BESIDE THE COUCH OF HER SON WITH ONE OF HIS HANDS IN HER OWN
BUT WONDER WITH PANSY HAD NEVER BEEN A REASON FOR NON COMPLIANCE I NEVER WILL AGAIN SHE SAID WITH EXQUISITE GENTLENESS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE THEY HAD TO SEPARATE AS IT APPEARED TO BE PART OF THE MILD
OF HELPLESSNESS THEN ISABEL TURNED SLOW EYES LOOKING DOWN AT HER MADAME MERLE WAS VERY PALE HER OWN EYES COVERED ISABEL'S FACE
THAT THE SIGNORA CONTESSA BEGGED THEM NOT TO WAIT SHE WOULD COME HOME IN A CAB ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS LADY'S QUICK SYMPATHIES HAD ENLISTED THEMSELVES WITH MISTER ROSIER ISABEL GOING RATHER LATE TO DRESS FOR DINNER FOUND PANSY SITTING IN HER ROOM
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SANE I SEE THE WHOLE THING DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO DEFEND HIM BUT I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD AGAINST HIM I'LL SPEAK ONLY OF YOU GOODWOOD ADDED QUICKLY
TURN THEIR PAINTED HEADS AND SHAKE THEM AT EACH OTHER BUT AS IN THIS LATTER CASE SHE WOULD FOR VERY SOLEMNITY'S SAKE NEVER HAVE MENTIONED THE AWFUL PHENOMENON SO SHE PUT AWAY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRETS OF LARGER LIVES THAN HER OWN
SAID RALPH WITH AN AIR OF PRIVATE AMUSEMENT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YES BUT IS HE REALLY IN LOVE VERY MUCH I THINK I CAN MAKE THAT OUT AH SAID ISABEL WITH A CERTAIN DRYNESS
PANSY HAD A SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION OF HER OWN AND ISABEL FELT THAT SHE HERSELF JUST NOW HAD NO LIGHT TO SPARE FROM HER SMALL STOCK NEVERTHELESS IT STILL CLUNG TO HER THAT SHE MUST BE LOYAL TO OSMOND THAT SHE WAS ON HER HONOUR IN DEALING WITH HIS DAUGHTER
I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME BUT I'VE A FLY AT THE DOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS NOT APPARENT WHETHER THE THANKS APPLIED TO HER HAVING REMINDED HIM OF HIS TRAIN OR TO THE MORE SENTIMENTAL REMARK GOOD BYE MISSUS OSMOND GOOD BYE
AT POSILIPPO MADAME MERLE HAD CEASED TO MINISTER TO ISABEL'S HAPPINESS WHO FOUND HERSELF WONDERING WHETHER THE MOST DISCREET OF WOMEN MIGHT NOT ALSO BY CHANCE BE THE MOST DANGEROUS
SO THAT HE MIGHT APPEAR TO SUFFER FOR GOOD MANNERS SAKE HER IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS OBJECTIONS PUT HIM TOO MUCH IN THE WRONG IT BEING IN EFFECT ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF EXPRESSING CONTEMPT
SHE SEEMED READY TO RETIRE HOW DOES THIS DEAR CHILD LOOK SHE ASKED OF ISABEL LINGERING A MOMENT SHE LOOKS PALE ISABEL ANSWERED THAT'S THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SHE'S VERY HAPPY
THAN THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC TO SAY NOTHING AND DRINKING DEEP IN SECRET OF ROMANCE SHE WAS AS LITTLE DISPOSED TO ASK POOR LILY'S ADVICE AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THAT RARE VOLUME FOREVER
AND SHE SAW THAT THE LARGE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND CHEERFUL AND THAT THE WELL USED GARDEN HAD SUN FOR WINTER AND SHADE FOR SPRING BUT SHE DISLIKED THE PLACE WHICH AFFRONTED AND ALMOST FRIGHTENED HER
HER COMING ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN A DECISION ON THAT OCCASION SHE HAD SIMPLY STARTED OSMOND GAVE NO SOUND AND NOW EVIDENTLY WOULD GIVE NONE HE WOULD LEAVE IT ALL TO HER FROM PANSY SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THAT WAS VERY SIMPLE
ISABEL THOUGHT OF HER HUSBAND AS LITTLE AS MIGHT BE BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS AT A DISTANCE BEYOND ITS SPELL SHE THOUGHT WITH A KIND OF SPIRITUAL SHUDDER OF ROME THERE WAS A PENETRATING CHILL IN THE IMAGE AND SHE DREW BACK
FOR ISABEL AND PANSY TOOK THEIR PLACES AGAIN IN THE CARRIAGE PANSY WHO FACED HER STEPMOTHER AT FIRST KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER LAP THEN SHE RAISED THEM AND RESTED THEM ON ISABEL'S THERE SHONE OUT OF EACH OF THEM A LITTLE MELANCHOLY RAY
HE WAS A THANKLESS SUBJECT OF REFERENCE IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HAVE TO THINK OF A PERSON WHO WAS SORE AND SOMBRE ABOUT YOU AND WHOM YOU COULD YET DO NOTHING TO RELIEVE
BUT VERY DEFINITE DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH PANSY LIVED THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GO DOWN ISABEL DESCENDED AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM THE GIRL WAS STANDING ABOVE YOU'LL COME BACK
WAS THAT OF A MAN NOT SO MUCH OFFERING AN EXPLANATION AS PUTTING A THING INTO WORDS ALMOST INTO PICTURES TO SEE HIMSELF HOW IT WOULD LOOK HE CONSIDERED A WHILE THE PICTURE HE HAD EVOKED AND SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED WITH IT AND THEN HE WENT ON
HE WAS HER APPOINTED AND INSCRIBED MASTER SHE GAZED AT MOMENTS WITH A SORT OF INCREDULOUS BLANKNESS AT THIS FACT IT WEIGHED UPON HER IMAGINATION HOWEVER CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HER MIND WERE ALL THE TRADITIONARY DECENCIES AND SANCTITIES OF MARRIAGE
THE TALL WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THOUGH ITS GREEN SHUTTERS WERE PARTLY DRAWN THE BRIGHT AIR OF THE GARDEN HAD COME IN THROUGH A BROAD INTERSTICE AND FILLED THE ROOM WITH WARMTH
YOU'RE VERY PHILOSOPHIC SAID HER COUSIN AND THEN IN A MOMENT MAY I ENQUIRE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ISABEL STARED I THOUGHT YOU KNEW LORD WARBURTON TELLS ME HE WANTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MARRY PANSY
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD RATHER DRYLY NOT DISCOURAGINGLY AND HE WENT ON IT WILL MAKE HIM SAY THAT YOUR WANT OF ZEAL IS OWING TO JEALOUSY HE STOPPED A MOMENT HER FACE MADE HIM AFRAID TO JEALOUSY TO JEALOUSY OF HIS DAUGHTER
HER ACUTE WHITE FACE WAS TERRIBLE DEAR AUNT LYDIA ISABEL MURMURED GO AND THANK GOD YOU'VE NO CHILD SAID MISSUS TOUCHETT DISENGAGING HERSELF
ELLE ECLAIRE LA MAISON SAID THE GOOD SISTER PANSY WORE AS MADAME MERLE HAD SAID A LITTLE BLACK DRESS IT WAS PERHAPS THIS THAT MADE HER LOOK PALE THEY'RE VERY GOOD TO ME THEY THINK OF EVERYTHING
BUT SHE HAD NEVER GUESSED SO HAPPILY AS THAT ISABEL'S SATISFACTIONS JUST NOW WERE FEW BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN MORE NUMEROUS
HE MUST LOOK OUT FOR A PIANO NOBILE AND HE GOES AWAY AFTER HAVING GOT A MONTH'S LODGING IN THE POOR LITTLE APARTMENT FOR NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE HOWEVER IS YOUR MOST WONDERFUL INVENTION SHE STRIKES ME AS A KIND OF MONSTER
HERE AND THERE WANDERED A PEASANT OR A TOURIST LOOKING UP AT THE FAR SKY LINE WHERE IN THE CLEAR STILLNESS A MULTITUDE OF SWALLOWS KEPT CIRCLING AND PLUNGING ISABEL PRESENTLY BECAME AWARE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER VISITORS
IT'S NOTHING TO COME TO EUROPE SHE SAID TO ISABEL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME ONE NEEDS SO MANY REASONS FOR THAT IT IS SOMETHING TO STAY AT HOME THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
ARE YOU VERY SURE HE'S TO BE MARRIED
HE HAD NOT BEEN VIOLENT AND YET THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE IN THE IMPRESSION THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE AT ANY RATE IN SOMETHING SOMEWHERE PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY IN HER OWN FIT OF WEEPING
NO IT'S MY OWN PROPOSAL I THINK I HAD BETTER WAIT THEN DID PAPA SEND ME NO MESSAGE I DON'T THINK HE KNEW I WAS COMING
SHE FOUND IT INDEED INTENSELY INTERESTING IT SEEMED TO SHOW HER HOW FAR HER HUSBAND'S DESIRE TO BE EFFECTIVE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING
CRUEL TO THE OTHER PERSON PERHAPS THE ONE SHE CARES FOR BUT WARBURTON ISN'T OBLIGED TO MIND THAT NO CRUEL TO HER SAID ISABEL SHE WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY IF SHE WERE TO ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO DESERT POOR MISTER ROSIER
SEVERAL OF RALPH'S TESTAMENTARY ARRANGEMENTS HE HAD TOLD HER EVERYTHING HAD CONSULTED HER ABOUT EVERYTHING HE LEFT HER NO MONEY OF COURSE SHE HAD NO NEED OF MONEY HE LEFT HER THE FURNITURE OF GARDENCOURT
IT FELL WITH A LEADEN WEIGHT ON ISABEL'S EARS IT SEEMED TO REPRESENT THE SURRENDER OF A PERSONALITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH WHEN MADAME CATHERINE HAD LEFT THEM TOGETHER PANSY KNEELED DOWN
THAT'S WHAT I SAY TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MATTER BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO COME OUT I WISH INDEED YOU MIGHT DON'T LEAVE ME HERE PANSY WENT ON GENTLY
THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON HER HABITUAL RESOURCES FOR HER TOO THE OCCASION WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TREAT IT BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOMENT THIS GAVE HER A PECULIAR GRAVITY
FROM THE MOMENT HOWEVER THAT BOTH THE LADIES WERE SO UNACCOMMODATING THERE WAS NOTHING FOR OSMOND BUT TO WISH THE LADY FROM NEW YORK WOULD TAKE HERSELF OFF IT WAS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE SATISFACTION HE GOT FROM HIS WIFE'S FRIENDS
HENRIETTA GAVE A LAUGH DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE RATHER TOO CONSIDERATE IT'S NOT OF HIM THAT I'M CONSIDERATE IT'S OF MYSELF ISABEL ANSWERED IT WAS NOT SURPRISING
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND REFINED TO MARK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS SYMPATHIES AND HER OWN AND SHOW THAT IF HE REGARDED HIS DAUGHTER AS A PRECIOUS WORK OF ART IT WAS NATURAL HE SHOULD BE MORE AND MORE CAREFUL ABOUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES
SHE LOOKS SO CHARMING I WENT AFTERWARDS TO SEE MOTHER CATHERINE WHO HAS A VERY GOOD ROOM TOO I ASSURE YOU I DON'T FIND THE POOR SISTERS AT ALL MONASTIC MOTHER CATHERINE HAS A MOST COQUETTISH LITTLE TOILET TABLE
THE THEORY I HAVE JUST MENTIONED WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT IT BROUGHT HER LITTLE REST AND IF YOU HAD SEEN HER PACING ABOUT YOU WOULD HAVE SAID SHE HAD A BAD CONSCIENCE SHE WAS NOT PACIFIED WHEN AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FINDING HERSELF IN VIEW OF THE HOUSE
SHE EXCLAIMED WITH ALL HER CUSTOMARY EAGERNESS TO ACCOMMODATE WE THINK OF YOU ALWAYS YOU'RE A PRECIOUS CHARGE MADAME CATHERINE REMARKED IN THE TONE OF A WOMAN WITH WHOM BENEVOLENCE WAS A HABIT AND WHOSE CONCEPTION OF DUTY
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELVES THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY HE CONTINUED THAT MAY EASILY HAPPEN AMONG THE MOST UNITED COUPLES SHE TOOK UP HER PARASOL HE SAW SHE WAS NERVOUS AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT SAY
AND THE FIRST USE SHE MADE OF IT WAS TO PRETEND SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM WHEN I TALK OF YOUR HELPING ME I TALK GREAT NONSENSE SHE SAID WITH A QUICK SMILE THE IDEA OF MY TROUBLING YOU WITH MY DOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS THE MATTER'S VERY SIMPLE
EACH AGGRESSIVE FACT OF HIS FACE HIS FIGURE HIS PRESENCE JUSTIFIED OF ITS INTENSE IDENTITY AND MADE ONE WITH THIS ACT OF POSSESSION SO HAD SHE HEARD OF THOSE WRECKED AND UNDER WATER
THAT HE HOPED SHE WOULD REMAIN AT GARDENCOURT AND SHE MADE NO IMMEDIATE MOTION TO LEAVE THE PLACE SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS BUT COMMON CHARITY TO STAY A LITTLE WITH HER AUNT IT WAS FORTUNATE SHE HAD SO GOOD A FORMULA
HE TELLS ME HE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE STILL HERE I KNOW HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS AND AS I WAS TOLD YOU WERE NOT IN THE HOUSE I BROUGHT HIM OUT TO SEE FOR HIMSELF
ISABEL SAID NOTHING FOR A MINUTE HER HEART BEAT FAST WILL YOU COME AWAY WITH ME NOW SHE ASKED PANSY LOOKED AT HER PLEADINGLY DID PAPA TELL YOU TO BRING ME
HE HADN'T SEEMED ABLE TO GRASP THE GREAT SCHOOL SYSTEM IT HAD BEEN REALLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM ON THE WHOLE HE HAD BEHAVED AS IF THERE WERE TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AS IF HE COULD ONLY TAKE IN A SMALL PART
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN ADDED AND YOU'LL SEE DEAR OLD GARDENCOURT AGAIN
RAPS ON THE WALLS AND ALMOST THINKS HE'LL TAKE THE PLACE WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO DRAW UP A LEASE THEN ON THE WHOLE HE DECIDES THAT THE ROOMS ARE TOO SMALL HE DOESN'T THINK HE COULD LIVE ON A THIRD FLOOR
HE HAS MADE ME BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE I NEVER DID BEFORE OF COURSE YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND THAT WITH THOSE CONVICTIONS I'M DREADFUL COMPANY FOR PANSY OSMOND TOOK A SIP OF A GLASS OF WINE HE LOOKED PERFECTLY GOOD HUMOURED
IN A CORNER OF IT HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A HIGH STANDARD OF COURTESY AND IT WAS THEREFORE NOT REMARKABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO COME DOWN FROM LONDON TO CALL ON MISSUS TOUCHETT
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
HIS FRAME AND MUSCLES DEVELOPED WITH LABOUR AND HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SWING ALL SAVE THE VERY HEAVIEST HAMMERS IN THE SHOP HE HAD NEVER ABATED IN HIS PRACTICE AT ARMS AND EVERY DAY WHEN WORK WAS OVER
GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER
WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED
REACHED THE TOP OF THE HEAP WELL DONE THE YOUNG PRINCE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HIS HANDS SEE HOW HE LAYS ABOUT HIM WITH THAT CLUB OF HIS THERE HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN THE LEADER OF THE DEFENDERS AS IF HIS CLUB HAD BEEN A BATTLE AXE WELL DONE YOUNG SIR WELL DONE
AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME
HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK
NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
SHE FEEBLY MADE HER WAY INTO THE VILLAGE
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON
THE CRAFTSMAN CLOSED THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION INTO THE INNER ROOM MY LADY ALICE HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW TONE YOU HERE AND IN SUCH A GUISE SURELY IT IS I THE LADY SIGHED ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I AM WELL NIGH INCLINED TO ASK MYSELF
TRULY HE IS WELL AND STURDY THE MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT HIM PROUDLY INDEED I HAVE BEEN ALMOST WISHING TODAY THAT HE WERE LIGHTER BY A FEW POUNDS
AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
SINCE SEARCHERS COULD BE SEEN APPROACHING A LONG WAY OFF AND ESCAPE COULD BE MADE BY PATHS ACROSS THE SWAMP
THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN
ADVANCED WITH ARDOUR TO THE ASSAULT AND OFFICERS AND MEN VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE VALOUR WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN VAIN DID THE GARRISON SHOWER ARROWS AND CROSS BOW BOLTS AMONG THEM AND POUR DOWN BURNING OIL AND QUICKLIME UPON THEM
THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED
AND IT WAS ON THEIR PETITIONS TO THE KING THAT THE SHERIFFS OF MIDDLESEX
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL MASTER WALTER BUT I AM WELL NIGH FAMISHED IT IS THIRTY SIX HOURS SINCE I SWALLOWED A BIT OF FOOD
SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
I THANK YOU INDEED SHE SAID FOR YOUR KINDNESS HAD YOU NOT TAKEN ME IN I THINK I WOULD HAVE DIED AT YOUR DOOR FOR INDEED I COULD GO NO FURTHER AND THOUGH I HOLD NOT TO LIFE YET WOULD I FAIN LIVE UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY BOY
YOU ARE DOING WELL YOUNG SIR THE ENGLISH LEADER WENT ON AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ON EACH OCCASION ON WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED I SHALL BE PROUD
OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
CITIZEN'S SON THOUGH HE BE MY LORD DE VAUX WILL YOU BID YOUR SQUIRE RIDE AT FULL SPEED TO THE TOWER AND TELL MASTER ROGER THE LEECH TO COME HERE WITH ALL HASTE
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG
I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER
AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
HAVE MADE THEIR WAY HERE IN A FEW MINUTES A COLD CAPON SEVERAL MANCHETS OF BREAD AND A STOOP OF WINE WERE PLACED BEFORE WALTER WHILE RALPH'S WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO BELOW
THE SCANDAL AND DESOLATION WHICH THEIR RIVALRY CAUSED IN CHRISTENDOM THE WASTE OF NOBLE LIVES THE DEVASTATION OF ONCE HAPPY PROVINCES AND THE EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD GOING FROM CAMP TO CAMP THEY EXHORTED
BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM
IN A SHORT TIME THE FADING BRIGHTNESS OF THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT FAR OVERHEAD TOLD THEM THAT TWILIGHT HAD COMMENCED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY ATTACHED THE FIRST STRAND TO THE ROPE SOME THREE FEET ABOVE THE WATER NOW WALTER SAID
YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE MASTER ROGER THE PRINCE SAID
AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE AND SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS A KNIGHT
AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
UNTIL THE OCCUPIERS OF THE ATTICS COULD WELL NIGH SHAKE HANDS ACROSS THEY SOON LEFT THE MORE CROWDED STREETS AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AFTER TEN MINUTES WALKING THE SMITH STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BOWYER SHOP NEAR ALDGATE
THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN IN THE MORNING I WILL GO FOR I HAVE A FRIEND WITHIN THE CITY WHO WILL METHINKS RECEIVE ME THE TONE OF VOICE AND THE ADDRESSING OF HIMSELF AS GOOD FELLOW AT ONCE CONVINCED THE MAN THAT THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM
IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID
OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
WON FOR HIMSELF THE PROUD POSITION OF CAPTAIN OF THE BOYS OF THE WARD OF ALDGATE GEOFFREY WARD HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO GIVE THE LAD LESSONS IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN NOT ENGAGED OTHERWISE WALTER WOULD ALMOST EVERY AFTERNOON
ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
AND HIS WEIGHT HAS SORELY TRIED ME HIS NAME IS WALTER AND I TRUST SHE ADDED LOOKING AT THE POWERFUL FIGURE OF HER HOST THAT HE WILL GROW UP AS STRAIGHT AND AS STALWART AS YOURSELF
WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
GEOFFREY WAS FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC AND SAID WELL WALTER ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT THAT GAFFER GILES HEARD ME SAY SO I THINK YOU HAVE HAD A PIECE OF RARE GOOD FORTUNE
AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
THE LIGHTS CAME OUT BRIGHTLY FROM MANY OF THE CASEMENTS WITH SOUNDS OF BOISTEROUS SONGS AND LAUGHTER THE WOMAN PASSED THESE WITHOUT A PAUSE PRESENTLY SHE STOPPED BEFORE A COTTAGE FROM WHICH A FEEBLE LIGHT ALONE SHOWED THAT IT WAS TENANTED SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
THE CHILD AND MOTHER MADE SHE WAS A FAIR GENTLE LOOKING GIRL SOME TWO AND TWENTY YEARS OLD AND IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE NOW FROM HER DELICATE FEATURES AND SOFT SHAPELY HANDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TOIL AND NOW THE SMITH SAID
AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
WHICH WILL LEAVE THREE OVER BUT WE HAD BETTER PLACE THEM A LITTLE OVER A YARD
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE
OF ITALY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES WHILE FROM ABOVE THE GRAIN NEEDED FOR THE WANTS OF THE GREAT CITY WAS FLOATED DOWN IN BARGES FROM THE WEST
THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY
THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
WITH THE ESPECIAL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR WORTHY SELF WALTER COULD HEAR NO MORE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS SHOES AND FOLLOWED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND THEIR VOICES STILL ACTED AS A GUIDE TO HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP BUT HE FEARED TO KEEP TOO CLOSE
AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
WHICH SHE NEEDS SORELY I WILL FETCH AN ARMFUL OF FRESH RUSHES FROM THE SHED AND STREW THEM HERE I WILL SLEEP IN THE SMITHY QUICK GIRL HE SAID SHARPLY
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
BEFORE THE FORCE OF THE FRENCH FORTY THOUSAND STRONG THE EARL OF NORFOLK HAD FALLEN BACK AND REJOINED THE KING BUT EVEN AFTER THIS JUNCTION THE FRENCH FORCES EXCEEDED THOSE OF EDWARD FOURFOLD THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS VANNES
YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
WHILE THE ENGLISH ARMY LAY ON A HILL THE FRENCH CAMP WAS PITCHED ON LOW GROUND AN UNUSUALLY WET SEASON HAD SET IN WITH BITTERLY COLD WIND THE RAIN WAS INCESSANT A PESTILENCE HAD DESTROYED A VAST NUMBER OF THEIR HORSES
TO A FELLOW CREATURE ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT FELLOW CREATURE IS A WOMAN WITH A CHILD POOR LITTLE CHAP HE LOOKS RIGHT WELL AND STURDY AND SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN NO ILL FROM HIS JOURNEY
THE WOMAN DRANK THE STEAMING BEVERAGE WHICH HER HOST BROUGHT WITH HIM
HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER OFF FROM A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED WITHOUT THE WALLS EACH PARTY HAD A FLAG ATTACHED TO A STICK AND THE BOYS WERE ARMED WITH CLUBS SUCH AS THOSE CARRIED BY THE APPRENTICE BOYS MANY OF THEM CARRIED MIMIC SHIELDS MADE OF WOOD
YOU MAY BE SURE THE KNIGHT REPLIED
TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW
CHAPTER TEN A PLACE OF REFUGE THE FRENCH EXCITED TO THE UTMOST BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR COMMANDERS AND BY THEIR DESIRE TO WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
THEY WERE CONTENT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE ONE DAY
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
THE GREAT RAYS STRUCK ACROSS IMPINGED UPON THE THOUSAND FOOT WHEEL THAT CROWNED THE CONES SET IT WHIRLING OVER IT I SAW FORM A LIMPID CLOUD OF THE BRILLIANT VAPORS WHENCE CAME THESE SPARKLING NEBULOSITIES
ALL PASSIONLESS YET RAPTUROUS OUT OF THE THING THAT HELD ME OUT FROM ITS FIRES PULSED VITALITY A FLOOD OF INHUMAN ENERGY IN WHICH I WAS BATHED AND IT WAS AS THOUGH THIS ENERGY WERE
LAY FLAMING AT MY FEET UPON THE NARROW LEDGE THERE WAS A ROARING WITHIN MY HEAD LOUDER FAR LOUDER THAN THAT WHICH BEAT AGAINST MY EARS SOMETHING WAS DRAWING ME FORTH
METAL HE ECHOED THESE THINGS METAL METAL ALIVE AND THINKING SUDDENLY HE WAS SILENT HIS FACE A PAGE ON WHICH VISIBLY
ASKING WHY WE ARE DEAF TO THEIR CRYING BLIND TO THEIR WONDER SOMETIMES THE VEILS DROP FROM A MAN'S EYES AND HE SEES AND SPEAKS OF HIS VISION
WAS NOT THE FATHER OF ISKANDER THE GOD ZEUS AMMON WHO CAME TO ISKANDER'S MOTHER IN THE FORM OF A GREAT SNAKE
THE GLINT OF AMUSEMENT IN VENTNOR'S EYES AT THIS FADED ABRUPTLY HIS FACE GREW SOMBER WAIT HE SAID I CARRIED AWAY SOME SOME EXHIBITS FROM THE CREVICE OF THE NOISES GOODWIN WHAT KIND OF EXHIBITS I ASKED EAGERLY
HE WENT ON BUT AFTER A TIME SHE GREW OLD AND UGLY AND WITHERED SO HE SLEW HER LIKE A LITTLE MOUND OF DUST SHE DANCED AND BLEW AWAY AFTER HE HAD SLAIN HER
THAT'S BETTER SAID DICK GO AHEAD AND HIT ME IF YOU WANT THE MADDER YOU GET THE BETTER YOU'LL FEEL FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD THEN HER ANGER FLED THANKS DICK SHE SAID QUIETLY
DOWN FROM THE IMMENSE WHEEL CAME POURING CATARACTS OF GREEN FIRES THEY CASCADED OVER THE CONES DELUGED THEM ENGULFED THEM BENEATH THAT RADIANT INUNDATION THE CONES GREW PERCEPTIBLY THEIR VOLUME INCREASED
BUT IT IS WRITTEN THAT DESPERATE DISEASES REQUIRE DESPERATE REMEDIES AND UNTIL INSPIRATION OR MESSAGE HOW TO REJOIN THOSE WHOM I HAD LOVED SO DEARLY CAME TO ME NOTHING LESS I FELT COULD DULL MY HEARTACHE AND FRANKLY
WHILE THROUGH THEM THRUSTING THEM ASIDE BENDING THEM PASSED VAST VAGUE SHAPES LIKE MOUNTAINS FORMING AND DISSOLVING LIKE DARKENING MONSTERS OF SOME WORLD OF LIGHT PUSHING THROUGH THICK FORESTS OF SLENDER HIGH REACHING TREES OF COLD FLAME
BETWEEN US AND THE VAST GATEWAY GLEAMING TRIANGLES BEGAN TO BREAK THROUGH THE VAPORS LIKE THE CUTTING FINS OF SHARKS GLINTS OF ROUND BODIES LIKE GIGANTIC PORPOISES THE VAPORS SEETHED WITH THEM
FREE BUT A MONSTER THE PECULIAR ABILITY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO SLIP SO READILY INTO THE REFUGE OF THE COMMONPLACE AFTER OR EVEN DURING SOME WELL NIGH INTOLERABLE CRISIS
PUT EM WHERE THEY'D BE SAFE HE CONTINUED I'VE AN IDEA THEY'RE FAR MORE CURIOUS THAN OUR ARMORED MEN AND OF FAR MORE IMPORTANCE AT ANY RATE WE MUST TAKE THEM WITH US GO WITH RUTH YOU AND DRAKE AND LOOK AT THEM
AS THOUGH I WERE A LITTLE WIND DANCING AMONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS A MIST WHIRLING DOWN A QUIET GLEN A SHIMMERING LANCE OF THE AURORA PULSING IN THE HIGH SOLITUDES AND THERE WAS MUSIC STRANGE AND WONDROUS MUSIC AND TERRIBLE
AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL
AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
AND WHOSE CALLING I WANT GOD HELP ME OH SO DESPERATELY TO HEED IT WHISPERED TO ME FIRST SHE SAID FROM NORHALA WHEN SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND ME IT WHISPERED AND THEN SEEMED TO FLOAT FROM HER AND COVER ME LIKE LIKE A VEIL
AND THE GREAT STARS HOW MANY HAD THEY AND THE CUBES DID THEY OPEN AS DID GLOBE AND PYRAMID CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT A SECRETION OF THE BRAIN
I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
THE FACES OF THE TWO GAPED UP LUDICROUS IN THEIR AMAZEMENT FOLLOW CRIED NORHALA VENTNOR LEAPED WILDLY FOR THE TOP DRAKE BESIDE HIM IN THE FLASH OF A HUMMING BIRD'S WING THEY WERE GRIPPING ME
THAT A MOMENT SHE CONSIDERED THEN TURNED TO THE SIX WAITING CUBES AGAIN AS AT A COMMAND FOUR OF THE THINGS MOVED SWIRLED IN TOWARD EACH OTHER WITH A WEIRD PRECISION WITH A MONSTROUS MARTIAL MIMICRY
THEY LAY ON THEIR SIDES WITH TIPS POINTING STARLIKE TO SIX SPHERES CLUSTERED LIKE A CONVENTIONALIZED FIVE PETALED PRIMROSE IN THE EXACT CENTER FIVE OF THESE SPHERES THE PETALS
I'M FOR PUSHING UP A NOTCH OR TWO AND GETTING INTO THE GORGE BEFORE DARK HE WAS VOICING MY OWN THOUGHT I'M WILLING TO FACE ANYTHING HUMAN
MADE ALLOWANCE FOR ITS POSSIBLE ACCELERATION BEGAN TO COUNT WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED DRAKE TAKE MY GLASSES I MUTTERED TRYING TO KEEP UP WHILE SPEAKING MY TALLY MATCHES IN MY POCKET SMOKE THE LENSES I WANT TO LOOK AT SUN
FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE CONE WAS NOW AT A DECIDED ANGLE WHILE THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CIRCLE HAD DROPPED A FULL TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD RESTED AND STILL IT FELL THERE CAME A GASP OF RELIEF FROM VENTNOR
HIS FACE DRAWN WITH ANXIETY HIS EYES FEVERISH CAN YOU SEE THEM WALTER HIS VOICE SHOOK GOD WHY DID I EVER LET HER GO LIKE THAT WHY DID I LET HER GO ALONE THEY'LL BE CLOSE AHEAD MARTIN
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT IT MAY BE THAT UNDER THAT FINGER OF FORCE THAT SPEAR OF LIGHT THAT WOUND IN THE SIDE OF OUR SUN HAD OPENED FURTHER THAT THE SUN HAD WINCED I DO NOT TO THIS DAY KNOW BUT WHETHER IT HAD OR NOT
THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
AND UPON AND ABOUT IT SHIFTING AND CHANGING ADDING TO OR TAKING AWAY BEAT OVER LEGIONS OF FORCES SEEN AND UNSEEN KNOWN AND UNKNOWN AND MAN AN ATOM IN THE FERMENT
ALL FLICKERING SCARLETS AND LEAPING YELLOWS NO LONGER WRATHFUL OR SULLEN THE PLACE DRIPPED RADIANCE WAS FILLING LIKE A CHRISOM WITH RADIANCE US TOO THE SPARKLING MISTS BATHED
PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
HE LAUGHED I'M FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY FREE
FOR GOD'S SAKE DICK HOLD FAST TO YOURSELF REMEMBER RUTH HE SHOOK HIS HEAD VIOLENTLY AS THOUGH TO BE RID OF SOME CLINGING CLOYING THING I'LL NOT FORGET AGAIN HE SAID
AND AT THE PAIN IN HIS CRY SHE WINCED WAIT SHE SAID AND HELD UP A LITTLE TREMULOUS HAND YOU ASKED AND NOW YOU MUST LISTEN SHE WAS SILENT AND WHEN ONCE MORE SHE SPOKE HER VOICE WAS LOW CURIOUSLY RHYTHMIC HER EYES RAPT
EQUALLY OF COURSE ALEXANDER VENTNOR HAD BEEN RIGHT YURUK I DEMANDED DIRECTLY IS SHE WHOM YOU CALL GODDESS NORHALA OF THE PEOPLE OF CHERKIS
IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN NOR SHALL I RECITE THE REASONS FOR MY RESTLESSNESS FOR THESE ARE KNOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE READ THAT HISTORY OF MINE
ON THEY SWEPT UNTIL THEY REACHED THE BASE OF THE CONES THEY PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF THE CRYSTAL TABLING THEY TURNED THERE WAS A FLASHING AS OF A METEOR BURSTING THE GLOBE HAD OPENED INTO THAT SPLENDOR OF JEWEL FIRES
AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
AT ANY RATE THE GODDESS WAS BORN SHEDDER OF THE LIGHTNINGS EVEN FROM HER BIRTH
IT'S STILL WITHIN ME WHISPERING WHISPERING URGING ME AWAY FROM YOU FROM MARTIN FROM EVERY HUMAN THING BIDDING ME GIVE MYSELF UP SURRENDER MY HUMANITY ITS SEAL SHE SOBBED
THERE WAS A FAMILIAR SOUND TO THAT CHERKIS OF COURSE IT WAS THE NAME OF XERXES THE PERSIAN CONQUEROR CORRUPTED BY TIME INTO THIS CHERKIS AND ISKANDER
IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN ENABLING US TO DETERMINE OUR COURSE I'M GOING TO REPEAT YOUR BROTHER'S QUESTION WHAT DID NORHALA DO TO YOU AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE FLOATING BEFORE THE DISK
BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
AFTER THEM TEN SPHERES BUT LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE SHAPE WHICH LED
ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
HEAD BENT HER ARMS AROUND THE KNEES OF THE WOMAN THEY SLIPPED INTO THE MISTS VANISHED AND AFTER THEM LIKE A LOG IN A RACING CURRENT WE TOO DIPPED BENEATH THE FAINTLY LUMINOUS VAPORS
AND NO HUMAN IMAGINATION COULD HAVE CONCEIVED IT NOR HUMAN HANDS HAVE MADE ITS THOUGHT OF BEAUTY REAL WHAT WERE THEIR SENSES THROUGH WHICH THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FED
I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THEM HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET CLASPED MY WRIST IN ONE OF HIS LONG HANDS LED ME THROUGH THE CURTAINED OVAL INTO THE CYLINDRICAL HALL
BUT THE SPEED INCREASED THE WIND PRESSURE BECAME ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE I TWISTED DROPPED UPON MY RIGHT ARM THRUST MY HEAD AGAINST MY SHOULDER STARED BACKWARD
THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
WHY IT'S DAWN HE WHISPERED GOODWIN YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LET ME SLEEP SO LONG I FEEL LIKE A DAMNED PIG NEVER MIND I SAID BUT WATCH THE EUNUCH CLOSELY
THE EGO BUT A SPARK OF REALIZATION RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY ALONG THE PATH OF TIME WITHIN THE MECHANISM WE CALL THE BRAIN MAKING CONTACT ALONG THAT PATH AS THE ELECTRIC SPARK AT THE END OF A WIRE
BENT DOWN AND STARED IN UTTER DISBELIEF OF WHAT MY OWN EYES BEHELD FOR STONE AND EARTH HAD BEEN CRUSHED COMPRESSED INTO A SMOOTH MICROSCOPICALLY GRAINED
WE HAD PLUNGED BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE RADIANT SEA LYING IN THE POSITION IN WHICH I WAS I WAS SENSIBLE OF A DIMINUTION OF THE CYCLONIC FORCE THE BLAST STREAMED UP AND OVER THE FRONT OF THE CUBE
TO ALL OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET WHERE ITS BASE RESTED AGAINST THE BLUE WALL AND FALLING AT A FULL THIRTY DEGREE PITCH THE MISTY EDGED CIRCLE HAD BECOME AN OVAL A FLATTENED ELLIPSE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND THREE TIMES THAT IN LENGTH
DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
WONDERED WHY I DID NOT LET IT HAVE IT THE SHOCK STILL HELD ME RIGID
BUT WHAT WAS HIS SON DOING IN THIS WILDERNESS WONDERING WHERE I CAME FROM HE ANSWERED MY UNSPOKEN QUESTION SHORT STORY WAR ENDED FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DIFFERENT FROM TIBET
AND IN ITS EXACT CENTER SHINING FORTH AS THOUGH IT OPENED INTO A PLACE OF PALE AZURE INCANDESCENCE WAS ANOTHER RECTANGULAR CYCLOPEAN PORTAL ON EACH SIDE OF IT
THE WONDER OF IT GREW AND GREW I THRILLED WITH IT I REMEMBER NOTHING OF THAT RIDE SAW NOTHING EXCEPT THAT ONCE THROUGH THE PEACE ENFOLDING ME PIERCED WARNING THAT MARTIN WAS IN PERIL AND I BROKE THROUGH TO SEE HIM CLUTCHING NORHALA AND TO SEE FLOATING UP IN HER EYES DEATH FOR HIM
TO MY SURPRISE I FOUND THAT I WAS HUNGRY AND WITH DEEP RELIEF I WATCHED RUTH PARTAKE OF FOOD AND DRINK EVEN THOUGH LIGHTLY ABOUT HER SEEMED TO HOVER SOMETHING OF THE ETHEREAL ELUSIVE AND DISQUIETING WAS IT THE STRANGELY PELLUCID LIGHT THAT GAVE THE EFFECT I WONDERED
EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
INTO THE RING'S MOUTH THE AURORA FLEW CASCADING IN A COLUMNED STREAM TO EARTH THEN SWIFTLY
VALLEY OF THE BLUE POPPIES IN THIS GREAT CRUCIBLE OF LIFE WE CALL THE WORLD IN THE VASTER ONE WE CALL THE UNIVERSE THE MYSTERIES LIE CLOSE PACKED
THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
AN UNTHINKABLY HUGE DYNAMO POURING ITS FLOODS OF ELECTRO MAGNETISM UPON ALL THE CIRCLING PLANETS THAT SOLAR CRATER WHICH WE NOW KNOW WAS WHEN AT ITS MAXIMUM ALL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES ACROSS
FAR TO THE WEST ANOTHER GRAY AND OCHREOUS GIANT REARED ITS BULK CLOSING THE VALE NORTH AND SOUTH THE HORIZON WAS A CHAOTIC SKY LAND OF PINNACLES SPIRED AND MINARETED STEEPLED AND TURRETED AND DOMED
I FELT MYSELF LEAP OUTWARD OUTWARD AND OUTWARD INTO
BITS OF METAL DICK'S GAZE SOUGHT MINE HELD IT AND THEY LOOKED FOR EACH OTHER THEY WORKED WITH EACH OTHER THINKINGLY CONSCIOUSLY THEY WERE DELIBERATE PURPOSEFUL LITTLE THINGS
GET UP RUTH HE ORDERED HE CAME BACK ONCE AND HE'LL COME BACK AGAIN NOW LET HIM BE AND HELP US GET A MEAL TOGETHER I'M HUNGRY
HE HUDDLED DOWN ONCE MORE CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF PEERING OVER NO ONE OF THE METAL PEOPLE HAD MOVED THE SILENCE THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN NOW THE FLANKING PYRAMIDS SHOT FORTH INTO TWIN STARS
MY FEET I COULD NOT LIFT I COULD ADVANCE ONLY BY GLIDING THEM AS THOUGH SKATING ALSO THE FORCE WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HELD ME SEEMED TO PASS ME ON FROM UNSEEN CLUTCH TO CLUTCH
EYES SHIELDED BEHIND ARMS FOLDED OVER HIS BROWS STRAINING FOR A GLIMPSE OF RUTH DRAKE CROUCHED BESIDE HIM BRACING HIM SUPPORTING HIM AGAINST THE TEMPEST OUR LINE OF FLIGHT BECAME LESS ABRUPT
HUNG PENDENT CLUSTERS OF OTHER DISKS SWARMED LIKE THE GLOBULAR HIVING OF THE CONSTELLATION HERCULES CAPTURED STARS AND EACH OF THESE PRISONED THE IMAGE OF OUR SUN A HUNDRED FEET BELOW US WAS THE CRATER FLOOR UP FROM IT
WRITHING CLOUDILY CONFUSEDLY RAPID THE FACETED DISKS WAVERED TURNED UPWARD THE WHEEL BEGAN TO WHIRL FASTER FASTER UP FROM THAT FLAMING CIRCLE OUT INTO THE SKY
WITH A LOOK OF STUPEFIED AMAZEMENT WHICH AT ANOTHER TIME I WOULD HAVE FOUND LAUGHABLE HE OBEYED HOLD THEM TO MY EYES I ORDERED THREE MINUTES HAD GONE BY THERE IT WAS
BUT NOT TERRIBLE TO ME WHO WAS PART OF IT VAST CHORDS AND SINGING THEMES THAT RANG LIKE CLUSTERS OF LITTLE SWINGING STARS AND HARMONIES THAT WERE LIKE THE VERY VOICE OF INFINITE LAW RESOLVING WITHIN ITSELF ALL DISCORDS AND ALL
TO ME DRIFTED ONLY THE WAILINGS OF OUR FLIGHT AND THE WHIMPERING TERROR OF THE PONY I TURNED MY HEAD CAUTIOUSLY UPON THE VERY EDGE OF THE FLYING BLOCKS SQUATTED DRAKE AND VENTNOR
AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
TIRED TEACHER HAD DISMISSED THEM FOR EIGHT WHOLE WEEKS AND GONE AWAY TO REST THE LITTLE SCHOOL HOUSE WAS SHUT UP LESSONS WERE OVER SPIRITS RISING FAST AND VACATION HAD BEGUN THE QUIET TOWN SEEMED SUDDENLY INUNDATED WITH CHILDREN
TEARING DOWN THE STREET LIKE A RUNAWAY COLT WAVING A LONG STRIP OF PAPER AS HE RAN NOW THEN WHAT'S THE MATTER DEMANDED BEN AS THE OTHER CAME UP GRINNING AND PUFFING BUT FULL OF GREAT NEWS
AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
THEN AS KINDLY AS SHE COULD MISS CELIA READ THE BRIEF LETTER WHICH TOLD THE HARD NEWS BLUNTLY FOR MISTER SMITHERS WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH MONTHS BEFORE AND NEVER TOLD THE BOY LEST HE SHOULD BE UNFITTED FOR THE WORK THEY GAVE HIM
AND SHE'S GOIN TO HAVE THE SEATS IN THE PORCH LIFT UP
AND TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE OLD FRIEND WHO LOVED HIM BEST THROWING HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HIS DOG BEN CLUNG ABOUT THE CURLY NECK SOBBING BITTERLY OH SANCH HE'S NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN
ADVISED SAM THINKING BAB GREAT FUN
SO KIND SO VERY KIND WAS SHE TO THEM ALL THAT WHEN AFTER AN HOUR OF MERRY PLAY SHE TOOK HER BROTHER IN TO BED THE THREE WHO REMAINED FELL TO PRAISING HER ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AND DRAWING BEN DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE WIDE STEP MISS CELIA TOOK OUT THE LETTERS WITH A SHADOW CREEPING OVER HER FACE AS SOFTLY AS THE TWILIGHT WAS STEALING OVER THE WORLD WHILE THE DEW FELL AND EVERY THING GREW STILL AND DIM
BEN WAS A PROMISING PUPIL AND MADE RAPID PROGRESS FOR EYE FOOT AND HAND HAD BEEN SO WELL TRAINED THAT THEY DID HIM GOOD SERVICE NOW AND BROWN WAS CONSIDERED A FIRST RATE CATCHER
AND BEN BROODED OVER THE FINE ETCHING OF THE DEAD AND DYING HORSES ON A BATTLE FIELD ONE PAST ALL FURTHER PAIN THE OTHER HELPLESS BUT LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM HIS DEAD MASTER TO NEIGH A FAREWELL TO THE COMRADES
I WANT YOU TO TAKE SANCH HOME AND TELL YOUR MOTHER I'M GOING TO WALK AND MAY BE WON'T BE BACK TILL SUNDOWN MISS CELIA SAID I MIGHT DO WHAT I PLEASED ALL DAY YOU REMEMBER NOW
NO ONE SAW HOW PITIFULLY HER EYES RESTED ON BEN'S HAPPY FACE WHEN THE LETTERS WERE PUT AWAY AND NO ONE MINDED THE NEW GENTLENESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE
SHE SAID STOOPING TO WIPE AWAY THE GREAT DROPS THAT KEPT ROLLING DOWN THE BROWN CHEEK HALF HIDDEN IN HER DRESS BUT BEN PUT HIS ARM OVER HIS FACE AND SOBBED OUT WITH A FRESH BURST OF GRIEF
AS THEY PUT THINGS TO RIGHTS BEFORE TAKING LEAVE SHE'S LIKE THE GOOD FAIRIES IN THE BOOKS AND HAS ALL SORTS OF NICE PRETTY THINGS IN HER HOUSE SAID BETTY ENJOYING A LAST HUG OF THE FASCINATING DOLL
THE BOYS TOOK TO BASE BALL LIKE DUCKS TO WATER AND THE COMMON WAS THE SCENE OF TREMENDOUS BATTLES WAGED WITH MUCH TUMULT BUT LITTLE BLOODSHED TO THE UNINITIATED IT APPEARED AS IF THESE YOUNG MEN HAD LOST THEIR WITS
SO THEY LAY ABOUT ON THE GRASS IN THE SHADE OF THE BIG ELM LANGUIDLY DISCUSSING THEIR VARIOUS WRONGS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS IT'S THE MEANEST FOURTH I EVER SAW CAN'T HAVE NO CRACKERS BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S HORSE GOT SCARED LAST YEAR
DIDN'T WE HAVE A LIVELY TIME GOING FOR THE DOCTORS AND GETTING HIM HOME ASKED ANOTHER BOY LOOKING AS IF HE FELT DEFRAUDED OF THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE ANNIVERSARY BECAUSE NO ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED AIN'T GOING TO BE FIREWORKS EITHER UNLESS SOMEBODY'S
AND AS SHE READ HER FACE GREW SO SOBER THEN SO SAD THAT IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN LOOKING HE WOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT BAD NEWS HAD CHASED AWAY THE SUNSHINE SO SUDDENLY NO ONE DID LOOK
AND THANKED HER BY LAYING HIS CHEEK AGAINST THE PRETTY SLIPPER THAT RESTED ON THE STEP BESIDE HIM AS IF HE HAD NO WORDS IN WHICH TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO THE GENTLE MISTRESS WHOM HE MEANT HENCEFORTH TO SERVE WITH GRATEFUL FIDELITY
SOMEHOW THOSE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO GO BEFORE BEN ALL ALONG THE PLEASANT ROAD AND HALF SPOILT HIS FUN FOR THOUGH HE LAUGHED AND TALKED CUT CANES AND SEEMED AS MERRY AS A GRIG
THEN SO SAD THAT IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN LOOKING HE WOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT BAD NEWS HAD CHASED AWAY THE SUNSHINE SO SUDDENLY NO ONE DID LOOK
AS HE LOOKED BEFORE HE LEAPED HE BEHELD A SIGHT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO STARE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FOR AN INSTANT THEN TURN AND BECKON SAYING IN AN EAGER WHISPER
SHE IS SO NICELY ASLEEP IT IS A PITY TO WAKE HER GOOD BY TILL TO MORROW LITTLE NEIGHBORS CONTINUED MISS CELIA AND DISMISSED THE GIRLS WITH A KISS IS BEN COMING TOO
FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW
AND WE DON'T WANT TO WALK FAST BEN SPOKE VERY DECIDEDLY AND TAKING BILLY'S ARM AWAY THEY WENT LEAVING POOR BAB AND SANCH TO WATCH THEM OUT OF SIGHT ONE SOBBING THE OTHER WHINING DISMALLY
BARN BURNS UP DON'T I JUST WISH THERE WOULD GLOOMILY RESPONDED ANOTHER YOUTH WHO HAD SO RASHLY INDULGED IN PYROTECHNICS ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT A NEIGHBOR'S COW HAD BEEN ROASTED WHOLE
AND SHE DOESN'T MIND HOW MANY QUESTIONS WE ASK I LIKE FOLKS THAT WILL TELL ME THINGS ADDED BAB WHOSE INQUISITIVE MIND WAS ALWAYS HUNGRY
FALLING INTO A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF SUCH DELIGHT YOU COULDN'T WALK FOUR MILES BEGAN BEN YES I COULD AS EASY AS NOT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY MONEY YOU HAVE I SAW YOU SHOWING YOUR DOLLAR
THAT THE BOYS COULD NOT LOOK AWFUL IF THEY TRIED HOW DARED YOU COME AFTER US MISS DEMANDED SAM AS SHE LOOKED CALMLY ABOUT HER AND TOOK A SEAT BEFORE SHE WAS ASKED SANCH WOULD COME AFTER BEN
BEFORE BEN COULD QUIET HIM BAB CAME CLIMBING UP THE BANK WITH SUCH A FUNNY MIXTURE OF FEAR FATIGUE DETERMINATION AND RELIEF IN HER DIRTY LITTLE FACE
BUT BEN THOUGHT THERE NEVER WAS SO SWEET A LADY AS THE ONE WHO LEANED OVER HIM TO SHOW HIM HOW THE DISSECTED MAP WENT TOGETHER AND NEVER SMILED AT HIS MISTAKES
I COULDN'T MAKE HIM GO HOME SO I HAD TO HOLD ON TILL HE WAS SAFE HERE ELSE HE'D BE LOST AND THEN BEN WOULD FEEL BAD THE CLEVERNESS OF THAT EXCUSE TICKLED THE BOYS IMMENSELY
SHE ISN'T MY MISSIS NOW MISS CELIA WOULDN'T CARE AND I'M GOING ANY WAY DO DO TAKE ME BEN I'LL BE JUST AS GOOD AS EVER WAS
AS IF THEIR LIVES DEPENDED ON IT EVERY ONE TALKING IN HIS GRUFFEST TONE BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SQUABBLING OVER EVERY POINT OF THE GAME AND SEEMING TO ENJOY HIMSELF IMMENSELY IN SPITE OF THE HEAT DUST UPROAR
SEEMING TO SOOTHE HIS PAIN AS THEY FELL WHILE THE SENSE OF LONELINESS PASSED AWAY AND IT GREW POSSIBLE TO WAIT TILL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO FATHER IN THAT FAR OFF COUNTRY LOVELIER THAN GOLDEN CALIFORNIA
SO YOU SHALL TAKE HER THESE BAB AND BETTY MAY CARRY BABY HOME FOR THE NIGHT SHE IS SO NICELY ASLEEP IT IS A PITY TO WAKE HER GOOD BY TILL TO MORROW LITTLE NEIGHBORS CONTINUED MISS CELIA AND DISMISSED THE GIRLS WITH A KISS IS BEN COMING TOO
FOR MISTER SMITHERS WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH MONTHS BEFORE AND NEVER TOLD THE BOY LEST HE SHOULD BE UNFITTED FOR THE WORK THEY GAVE HIM OF BEN BROWN THE ELDER'S DEATH THERE WAS LITTLE TO TELL
FOR THERE WAS A QUIVER IN HER VOICE THE MEANING OF WHICH HE FELT BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD MISS CELIA PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HIM AND ANSWERED VERY TENDERLY BEN DEAR IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK
SEEING NO SIGN OF THE THREE FAMILIAR FIGURES SHE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING AS STEADILY AS A LITTLE INDIAN ON THE WAR TRAIL OH SANCH WHAT SHALL I DO IF THEY DON'T COME ALONG WE MUST HAVE GONE BY THEM SOMEWHERE FOR I DON'T SEE ANY ONE THAT WAY
NO ONE COULD GRANT THAT WISH BUT MISS CELIA DID COMFORT HIM FOR PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF MUSIC FLOATED OUT FROM THE PARLOR MUSIC SO SOFT SO SWEET THAT INVOLUNTARILY THE BOY STOPPED HIS CRYING TO LISTEN
WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
AND BEN SWAYED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE WAS ALREADY DOING IT IN IMAGINATION YOU MAY TAKE A TURN ROUND MY FIELD ON LITA ANY DAY SHE WOULD LIKE IT AND THORNY'S SADDLE WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK SAID MISS CELIA
SAID BETTY ENJOYING A LAST HUG OF THE FASCINATING DOLL WHOSE LIDS WOULD SHUT SO THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SING BYE SWEET BABY BYE WITH NO STARING EYES TO SPOIL THE ILLUSION WHAT HEAPS SHE KNOWS
WHO FELT BITTERLY TOWARD ALL MANKIND AT THAT INSTANT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO HOPE OF HIS GOING SAY THAT AGAIN AND I'LL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF AND BEN FACED ROUND WITH A GESTURE WHICH CAUSED THE OTHER TO SKIP OUT OF REACH PRECIPITATELY
SQUIRE SENT YOU A LETTER AND I'M HAVING SUCH A JOLLY TIME I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEN RUMMAGED OUT THE NOTE WITH REMORSEFUL HASTE PROTESTING THAT HE WAS IN NO HURRY FOR MISTER GULLIVER
AND BEN GRATEFULLY SURVEYED THE ARAB CHIEF NOW HIS OWN THOUGH THE BEST OF ALL THE COLLECTION WON'T WE HAVE SPLENDID TIMES SHE SAYS WE MAY COME OVER EVERY NIGHT AND PLAY WITH HER AND THORNY
ASKED BAB AS BETTY TROTTED OFF IN A SILENT RAPTURE WITH THE BIG DARLING BOBBING OVER HER SHOULDER NOT YET I'VE SEVERAL THINGS TO SETTLE WITH MY NEW MAN TELL MOTHER HE WILL COME BY AND BY OFF RUSHED BAB WITH THE PLATEFUL OF GOODIES
WHISPERED KIND HEARTED BILLY WITH A CONSOLING PAT ON THE CROWN OF THE SHABBY STRAW HAT WHEN THE CIRCUS COMES HERE YOU SHALL GO CERTAIN SURE AND BETTY TOO SAID BEN FEELING MEAN WHILE HE PROPOSED WHAT HE KNEW WAS A HOLLOW MOCKERY
EVERY HILLSIDE BLOOMED WITH GAY GOWNS LOOKING AS IF THE FLOWERS HAD GONE OUT FOR A WALK AND THE WOODS WERE FULL OF FEATHERLESS BIRDS CHIRPING AWAY AS BLITHELY AS THE THRUSHES ROBINS AND WRENS
HOLD ON A MINUTE WHILE I GET ONE MORE DRINK BUNS ARE DRY FODDER SAID SAM ROLLING OVER TO THE EDGE OF THE BANK AND PREPARING TO DESCEND WITH AS LITTLE TROUBLE AS POSSIBLE HE NEARLY WENT DOWN HEAD FIRST HOWEVER FOR
SHE BEGAN SLOWLY AND THE BOY WAITED WITH A HAPPY FACE FOR NO ONE HAD CALLED HIM SO SINCE MELIA DIED THE SQUIRE HAS HEARD ABOUT YOUR FATHER
MUTTERED BEN HASTILY TURNING BACK TO THE CHEERFUL PICTURE OF THE THREE HAPPY HORSES IN THE FIELD STANDING KNEE DEEP AMONG THE GRASS AS THEY PREPARE TO DRINK AT THE WIDE STREAM
WHICH HID THE KING OF BEASTS FROM HIS LONGING SIGHT THAT WAS A COW MOOING DON'T YOU BE A DONKEY BILL WHEN YOU HEAR A REAL ROAR YOU'LL SHAKE IN YOUR BOOTS SAID BEN HOLDING UP HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO DRY
WITH A LOW WHINE AS IF HE SAID COUNT ME IN AND LET ME HELP TO PAY MY MASTER'S DEBT IF I CAN MISS CELIA SHOOK THE OFFERED PAW CORDIALLY
CRICKY WOULDN'T I LIKE TO SEE THAT SAID LITTLE CYRUS FAY DEVOUTLY HOPING THAT THE CAGE IN WHICH THIS PLEASING SPECTACLE TOOK PLACE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE YOU NEVER WOULD IT'S ONLY A PICTURE
YES HE SAID HE MIGHT GO AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA AND IF HE DID HE'D SEND FOR ME I'D LIKE TO GO THERE IT'S A REAL SPLENDID PLACE THEY SAY HE HAS GONE FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT TO A LOVELIER COUNTRY THAN CALIFORNIA I HOPE
AND I'LL GO HOME ALONE I AIN'T AFRAID SANCH WILL TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU WON'T ANSWERED BAB STOUTLY WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR MOTHER WILL SAY TO YOU ASKED BEN FEELING MUCH REPROACHED BY HER LAST WORDS
HASN'T GOT ANY MONEY MORE LIKELY OBSERVED A SHABBY YOUTH WHOSE POCKETS NEVER HAD ANY THING IN THEM BUT A PAIR OF DIRTY HANDS BEN CALMLY PRODUCED A DOLLAR BILL AND WAVED IT DEFIANTLY BEFORE THIS DOUBTER
HOW LONG SHE PLAYED MISS CELIA NEVER MINDED BUT WHEN SHE STOLE OUT TO SEE IF BEN HAD GONE SHE FOUND THAT OTHER FRIENDS EVEN KINDER THAN HERSELF
MISS CELIA STOOPED TO PAT THE WHITE HEAD AND TO STROKE THE BLACK ONE LYING SO NEAR IT THAT THE DOG'S BREAST WAS THE BOY'S PILLOW PRESENTLY THE SOBBING CEASED AND BEN WHISPERED WITHOUT LOOKING UP TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I'LL BE GOOD
AND CLIMBING THE GREEN BANK ABOVE THEY LAY ON THE GRASS UNDER A WILD CHERRY TREE MUNCHING LUXURIOUSLY WHILE THEY FEASTED THEIR EYES AT THE SAME TIME ON THE SPLENDORS AWAITING THEM FOR THE GREAT TENT WITH ALL ITS FLAGS FLYING
QUESTIONING THE NEW FRIEND MEANTIME WITH EYES SO FULL OF DUMB LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND SORROW THAT THEY SEEMED ALMOST HUMAN WIPING AWAY HER OWN TEARS
THEY NEVER DO COME TO SUCH LITTLE TOWNS YOU SAID SO AND I THINK YOU ARE VERY CROSS AND I WON'T TAKE CARE OF SANCH SO NOW CRIED BAB GETTING INTO A PASSION YET READY TO CRY SHE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED
HOW LONG SHE PLAYED MISS CELIA NEVER MINDED BUT WHEN SHE STOLE OUT TO SEE IF BEN HAD GONE SHE FOUND THAT OTHER FRIENDS EVEN KINDER THAN HERSELF HAD TAKEN THE BOY INTO THEIR GENTLE KEEPING
AND GRAVELY PUT HIS PAW UPON HER KNEE WITH A LOW WHINE AS IF HE SAID COUNT ME IN AND LET ME HELP TO PAY MY MASTER'S DEBT IF I CAN MISS CELIA SHOOK THE OFFERED PAW CORDIALLY AND THE GOOD CREATURE CROUCHED AT HER FEET LIKE A SMALL LION
SAID THE AMIABLE BILLY WITH A SLAP ON THE SHOULDER AND A CORDIAL GRIN WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BEN TO RESIST WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR DEMANDED SAM READY TO BE OFF THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE IT EASY
THOUGH YOU MIGHT DO FOR A FAT BOY IF SMITHERS WANTED ONE SAID BEN SURVEYING THE STOUT YOUTH WITH CALM CONTEMPT LET'S GO IN SWIMMING NOT LOAF ROUND HERE IF WE CAN'T PLAY
TO SHOW HIM HOW THE DISSECTED MAP WENT TOGETHER AND NEVER SMILED AT HIS MISTAKES SO KIND SO VERY KIND WAS SHE TO THEM ALL THAT WHEN AFTER AN HOUR OF MERRY PLAY SHE TOOK HER BROTHER IN TO BED
HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED LEAVE TO GO AND BEEN KINDER TO BAB
IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK COULD YOU BEAR IT I GUESS I COULD BUT YOU DON'T MEAN IT OH MA'AM HE ISN'T DEAD CRIED BEN WITH A CRY THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE
HE KNEW HE WAS AN ORPHAN NOW AND TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE OLD FRIEND WHO LOVED HIM BEST THROWING HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HIS DOG BEN CLUNG ABOUT THE CURLY NECK SOBBING BITTERLY
WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT YOU SHALL STAY HERE AND NO ONE SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY AGAINST YOUR WILL I CALLED YOU MY BOY IN PLAY NOW
ANSWERED SAM PRODUCING HALF A DOLLAR AS IF SUCH MAGNIFICENT SUMS WERE NO STRANGERS TO HIS POCKET COME ON BROWN YOU'LL BE A FIRST RATE FELLOW TO SHOW US ROUND AS YOU KNOW ALL THE DODGES SAID BILLY
THAT NOW IS SOMETHING LIKE AND BEN WHO HAD PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THE WORD CIRCUS LAID HIS FINGER ON A SMALLER CUT OF A MAN HANGING BY THE BACK OF HIS NECK WITH A CHILD IN EACH HAND TWO MEN SUSPENDED FROM HIS FEET
THE THREE WHO REMAINED FELL TO PRAISING HER ENTHUSIASTICALLY AS THEY PUT THINGS TO RIGHTS BEFORE TAKING LEAVE SHE'S LIKE THE GOOD FAIRIES IN THE BOOKS
UNPROPITIOUS THORNY HAD GONE OUT OF TOWN WITH HIS SISTER TO PASS THE DAY TWO OF THE BEST PLAYERS DID NOT APPEAR AND THE OTHERS WERE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED BY THE FESTIVITIES WHICH BEGAN AT SUNRISE FOR THEM
I GUESS SHE'LL SAY YOU LED ME INTO MISCHIEF AND THE SHARP CHILD NODDED AS IF SHE DEFIED HIM TO DENY THE TRUTH OF THAT
AND LANDED DIRECTLY ON BEN'S BACK AS HE LAY PEEPING OVER A PEAL OF LAUGHTER GREETED HIM AND HAVING GOT THE BETTER OF HIS MASTER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE HE MADE THE MOST OF THE ADVANTAGE BY PLAYFULLY WORRYING HIM AS HE KEPT HIM DOWN
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THE HEAD BEN HAD LIFTED UP WITH A DESPERATE SORT OF LOOK WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT
BAB WITH A FACE AS RED AS A LOBSTER AND STREAKED WITH TEARS SHOES WHITE WITH DUST PLAYFROCK TORN AT THE GATHERS SOMETHING BUNDLED UP IN HER APRON AND ONE SHOE DOWN AT THE HEEL AS IF IT HURT HER
AND PLANNING TO DO THE HONORS HANDSOMELY TO THE BOYS IT WAS VERY WARM AND JUST OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN THEY PAUSED BY A WAYSIDE WATERING TROUGH TO WASH THEIR DUSTY FACES
BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
NO I BROUGHT THE BOOK BUT IN THE HURRY OF MY TEA PARTY FORGOT TO UNPACK IT I'LL HUNT IT UP TO NIGHT REMIND ME THORNY THERE NOW I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING TOO
AND GETTING A SMART RAP ACROSS THE NOSE AS HE FAILED TO PERFORM THE FEAT MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT IT OLD CHAP IT'S HARD WORK I CAN TELL YOU AND THAT WOULDN'T SUIT SUCH A LAZY BONES THEN YOU ARE TOO BIG TO BEGIN
HIS SENSE OF PROSAIC EXCELLENCE AFFECTED HIS VERSE RATHER THAN HIS PROSE WHICH IS NOT ONLY FERVID RICHLY FIGURED POETIC AS WE SAY BUT VITIATED ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BY MANY A SCANNING LINE
BELOW THE SURFACE ITS TROUBLES ITS DISORDERS
IN PASCAL FOR INSTANCE IN THE PERSUASIVE WRITERS GENERALLY HOW DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE POINT WHERE FROM TIME TO TIME ARGUMENT WHICH IF IT IS TO BE WORTH ANYTHING AT ALL MUST CONSIST OF FACTS OR GROUPS OF FACTS
A THING IN FACT NATURALLY DISTRESSING TO THE SCHOLAR WHO WILL THEREFORE EVER BE SHY OF OFFERING UNCOMPLIMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO THE READER'S WIT
NEED I SAY THAT I DID NOT COME HERE TO GIVE YOU OFFENCE DOUBTLESS
TRUTH TRUTH TO BARE FACT THERE IS THE ESSENCE OF SUCH ARTISTIC QUALITY AS THEY MAY HAVE TRUTH THERE CAN BE NO MERIT NO CRAFT AT ALL WITHOUT THAT AND FURTHER
ROUGH AND DISJOINTED INDEED BUT FORCED TO YIELD IN PLACES ITS PROFOUNDER MEANING IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE IN CONTRAST WITH THE FLAWLESS EXECUTION OF ROMEO AND JULIET
COME WITH THE QUIET OF THE CLOISTER AS A RELIEF TO THIS LUST AND PRIDE OF LIFE LIKE SOME GREY MONASTIC PICTURE
FOR MYSELF MONSEIGNEUR I HAVE CONSULTED MY CONSCIENCE WITH AN ENTIRE SINCERITY AND ALTHOUGH MY YOUTH HAS BEEN AMISS I AM CERTAIN THAT MY ATHEISM PROCEEDS FROM NO SENTIMENT OF PERSONAL INTEREST ON THE CONTRARY
ENGLISH FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PAST HAS BEEN ASSIMILATING THE PHRASEOLOGY OF PICTORIAL ART FOR HALF A CENTURY THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THE GREAT GERMAN METAPHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF EIGHTY YEARS AGO IN PART ALSO
BUT IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE QUITE CERTAINLY SHAKESPEARE HAS DIRECTED THE ATTENTION OF SYMPATHETIC READERS ALONG CERTAIN CHANNELS OF MEDITATION BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SCOPE OF HIS WORK MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE
A CURIOSITY ABOUT EVERYTHING WHATEVER AS IT REALLY IS INVOLVING A CERTAIN HUMILITY OF ATTITUDE COGNATE TO WHAT MUST AFTER ALL BE THE LESS AMBITIOUS FORM OF LITERATURE
SHAKESPEARE HAS SPENT HIS ART IN JUST ENOUGH MODIFICATION OF THE SCHEME OF THE OLDER PLAY TO MAKE IT EXPONENT OF THIS PURPOSE
FOR INANIMATE OBJECTS BEING BUT A BARBAROUS AND REALLY INEXPRESSIVE SURVIVAL YET WE HAVE KNOWN MANY THINGS LIKE THIS RACY SAXON MONOSYLLABLES CLOSE TO US AS TOUCH AND SIGHT
IS CONSCIOUS OF THE WORDS HE WOULD SELECT IN SYSTEMATIC READING OF A DICTIONARY AND STILL MORE OF THE WORDS HE WOULD REJECT WERE THE DICTIONARY OTHER THAN JOHNSON'S AND DOING THIS WITH HIS PECULIAR SENSE OF THE WORLD EVER IN VIEW
TO BECOME TUTOR TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE FIRST I MEET IS A THING I ABHOR
SURPLUSAGE HE WILL DREAD THAT AS THE RUNNER ON HIS MUSCLES FOR IN TRUTH ALL ART DOES BUT CONSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SURPLUSAGE FROM THE LAST FINISH OF THE GEM ENGRAVER BLOWING AWAY THE LAST PARTICLE OF INVISIBLE DUST
THE CLEAN DAINTY WORD SPARING LITERARY OPERATION WORD SPARING YET WITH NO LOSS OF REAL GRACE OR EASE WHICH SOMETIMES IN A FEW PAGES WITH THE PERFECT LOGIC OF A PROBLEM OF EUCLID COMPLICATES AND THEN UNRAVELS SOME MORAL EMBARRASSMENT
A TRUE HUMAN PROPRIETY TO ITS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED TURNS OF FEELING AND CHARACTER
AS IT SEEMS SO THAT WE WATCH TO THE END FOR THE TRACES WHERE THE NOBLER HAND HAS GLANCED ALONG LEAVING ITS VESTIGES AS IF ACCIDENTALLY OR WASTEFULLY IN THE RISING OF THE STYLE
HE WILL INTERMIX READILY WITH THOSE LONG SAVOURSOME LATIN WORDS
CURRENTLY RECOGNISING THE INCIDENT THE COLOUR THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS OR PARTICLES IN WORDS LIKE ABSORB CONSIDER EXTRACT TO TAKE THE FIRST THAT OCCUR
THE INTEREST OF MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE IS PARTLY THAT OF AN OLD STORY TOLD OVER AGAIN WE MEASURE WITH CURIOSITY THAT VARIETY OF RESOURCES WHICH HAS ENABLED SHAKESPEARE
HE KNOWS THE NARCOTIC FORCE OF THESE UPON THE NEGLIGENT INTELLIGENCE TO WHICH ANY DIVERSION LITERALLY IS WELCOME ANY VAGRANT INTRUDER BECAUSE ONE CAN GO WANDERING AWAY WITH IT FROM THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT JEALOUS
THE LITERATURE OF POWER AND THE LITERATURE OF KNOWLEDGE
IN SEARCH OF AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE ADEQUATE EXPRESSION OF THAT HE BEGETS A VOCABULARY FAITHFUL TO THE COLOURING OF HIS OWN SPIRIT AND IN THE STRICTEST SENSE ORIGINAL THAT LIVING AUTHORITY WHICH LANGUAGE NEEDS LIES IN TRUTH
ON OUR SIDE THE SPECTATORS SIDE OF THIS PAINTED SCREEN WITH ITS PUPPETS WHO ARE REALLY GLAD OR SORRY ALL THE TIME WHAT PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE WHAT SORT OF EQUITY
WITH MILTON AND TAYLOR IT WILL BE USELESS TO PROTEST THAT IT CAN BE NOTHING AT ALL EXCEPT SOMETHING VERY TAMELY AND NARROWLY CONFINED TO MAINLY PRACTICAL ENDS
HERE THEN WITH A VIEW TO THE CENTRAL NEED OF A SELECT FEW
HAS HAD THOUGHTS DURING HIS TEDIOUS STAY AT LA SAVINIERE OF WRITING A HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH
BELIEVE ME A MAN MAY LOVE SPORT HIS CLUB HIS WORLDLY HABITS AND YET HAVE HIS HOURS OF THOUGHT OF SELF RECOLLECTION DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IN THOSE HOURS ONE DOES NOT FEEL THE FRIGHTFUL DISCOMFORT OF AN EXISTENCE WITH NO MORAL BASIS
AS USELESS AS THE PROTEST THAT POETRY MIGHT NOT TOUCH PROSAIC SUBJECTS AS WITH WORDSWORTH OR AN ABSTRUSE MATTER AS WITH BROWNING OR TREAT CONTEMPORARY LIFE NOBLY AS WITH TENNYSON
AS BEING PREFERABLE PLEASANTER MORE BEAUTIFUL TO THE WRITER HIMSELF IN LITERATURE AS IN EVERY OTHER PRODUCT OF HUMAN SKILL IN THE MOULDING OF A BELL OR A PLATTER FOR INSTANCE WHEREVER THIS SENSE ASSERTS ITSELF
I AM NOT USUALLY SO VERY TALKATIVE IT IS BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS IN QUESTION AND I SHOULD WISH HIS MEMORY TO BE AS DEAR AND AS VENERABLE TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD AS IT IS TO ME
IN THE JUST SPACING OUT OF WORD TO THOUGHT IN THE LOGICALLY FILLED SPACE CONNECTED ALWAYS WITH THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF DIFFICULTY OVERCOME DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PERSONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES MAKE OF COURSE VERY VARIOUS DEMANDS UPON LITERATURE
THE MOATED GRANGE WITH ITS DEJECTED MISTRESS ITS LONG LISTLESS DISCONTENTED DAYS WHERE WE HEAR ONLY THE VOICE OF A BOY BROKEN OFF SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE LOVELIEST SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE OR OF SHAKESPEARE'S SCHOOL
THIS UNCLE AN ARTIFICIAL OLD PARISIAN IN MANNER BUT HONEST IN PURPOSE A GOOD TALKER AND FULL OF REAL AFFECTION FOR HIS HEIR BERNARD
IN HIS SELF CRITICISM
TO REALLY STRENUOUS MINDS THERE IS A PLEASURABLE STIMULUS IN THE CHALLENGE FOR A CONTINUOUS EFFORT ON THEIR PART TO BE REWARDED BY SECURER AND MORE INTIMATE GRASP OF THE AUTHOR'S SENSE SELF RESTRAINT A SKILFUL ECONOMY OF MEANS
THAT ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTION OF WORK WHICH FORESEES THE END IN THE BEGINNING AND NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF IT
WILL STILL TAKE THE PLACE OF FACT IN VARIOUS DEGREES YOUR HISTORIAN FOR INSTANCE WITH ABSOLUTELY TRUTHFUL INTENTION AMID THE MULTITUDE OF FACTS PRESENTED TO HIM MUST NEEDS SELECT AND IN SELECTING
SO ONLY EACH WORD OR SYLLABLE BE NOT OF FALSE COLOUR TO CHANGE MY ILLUSTRATION A LITTLE WELL THAT IS BECAUSE ANY WRITER WORTH TRANSLATING AT ALL HAS WINNOWED AND SEARCHED THROUGH HIS VOCABULARY
AND THE SUBSEQUENT RECONCILIATION OF ISABELLA SO THAT SHE PLEADS SUCCESSFULLY FOR HIS LIFE IT WAS FROM WHETSTONE A CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH WRITER THAT SHAKESPEARE DERIVED THE OUTLINE OF
IS THE PLEASANTEST OF MANY GLIMPSES WE GET HERE OF PLEASANT PLACES THE FIELD WITHOUT THE TOWN ANGELO'S GARDEN HOUSE THE CONSECRATED FOUNTAIN
IN SUBORDINATION TO ONE ESSENTIAL BEAUTY IN ALL GOOD LITERARY STYLE IN ALL LITERATURE AS A FINE ART
WITH UNDIMINISHED VIGOUR UNFOLD AND JUSTIFY THE FIRST A CONDITION OF LITERARY ART WHICH IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO ANOTHER QUALITY OF THE ARTIST HIMSELF TO BE SPOKEN OF LATER
WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC INSTINCT OF HIS AGE LOVED TO EMPHASISE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN POETRY AND PROSE THE PROTEST AGAINST THEIR CONFUSION WITH EACH OTHER COMING WITH SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED EFFECT FROM ONE WHOSE POETRY WAS SO PROSAIC IN TRUTH
AS IF ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND AND THEY LEAVE IN US AS THEY PASS RUINS ONLY AND DARKNESS SUCH HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF MANY OTHERS AND IT HAS BEEN AS INVOLUNTARY AS IT IS IRREPARABLE AND I
BEING A PLEDGE THAT IT IS WORTH THE READER'S WHILE TO BE ATTENTIVE TOO THAT THE WRITER IS DEALING SCRUPULOUSLY WITH HIS INSTRUMENT AND THEREFORE INDIRECTLY WITH THE READER HIMSELF ALSO THAT HE HAS THE SCIENCE OF THE INSTRUMENT HE PLAYS ON
IN A LIBERAL NATURALISATION OF THE IDEAS OF SCIENCE TOO FOR AFTER ALL THE CHIEF STIMULUS OF GOOD STYLE IS TO POSSESS A FULL RICH COMPLEX MATTER TO GRAPPLE WITH THE LITERARY ARTIST THEREFORE
AND OF A TRUE DIGNITY IN DANGER GIVING EACH OTHER A SYMPATHETIC IF TRANSITORY REGRET ONE SORRY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE FOOLISHLY LOST AT A GAME OF TICK TACK
YOU SEE TOO THAT ALL OUR FURNITURE FROM PRESSES AND SIDEBOARDS DOWN TO OUR LITTLE TABLES AND OUR ARM CHAIRS IS IN THE SEVEREST STYLE OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH MY FATHER DID NOT APPRECIATE THE DAINTY RESEARCH OF OUR MODERN LUXURY
SHAPED BY IT REMAINS AS A WELL FIXED TYPE IN THE MEMORY HE MAY RETURN A SECOND OR THIRD TIME TO SIBYLLE OR LE JOURNAL D'UNE FEMME OR LES AMOURS DE PHILIPPE AND WATCH SURPRISED AFRESH
BUT THERE WERE ALSO GREAT REPENTANCES THERE WAS A CERTAIN HIGHER REGION TO WHICH EVERYTHING CONDUCTED EVEN WHAT AS EVIL SHE BLUSHED DEEPLY THEN RISING A LITTLE SUDDENLY A LONG SPEECH SHE SAID FORGIVE ME
IN THE HABITUAL AND SUMMARY RECOGNITION OF WHICH SCHOLARSHIP CONSISTS A WRITER FULL OF A MATTER HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS ANXIOUS TO EXPRESS MAY THINK OF THOSE LAWS THE LIMITATIONS OF VOCABULARY STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE AS A RESTRICTION
A MINUTE AND CONSTANT OBSERVER OF THEIR PHYSIOGNOMY HE WILL BE ON THE ALERT NOT ONLY FOR OBVIOUSLY MIXED METAPHORS OF COURSE BUT FOR THE METAPHOR THAT IS MIXED IN ALL OUR SPEECH THOUGH A RAPID USE MAY INVOLVE NO COGNITION OF IT
WE PASS OVER THE MANY LITTLE DRAMATIC INTRIGUES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS WITH THE MORE OR LESS ADROIT INTERFERENCES OF THE UNCLE WHICH RAISE AND LOWER ALTERNATELY BERNARD'S HOPES
TURNED THE THING INTO A TALE INCLUDED IN HIS HEPTAMERON OF CIVIL DISCOURSES WHERE IT STILL FIGURES AS A GENUINE PIECE WITH TOUCHES OF UNDESIGNED POETRY A QUAINT FIELD FLOWER HERE AND THERE OF DICTION OR SENTIMENT
THIS STORY AS IT APPEARS IN WHETSTONE'S ENDLESS COMEDY IS ALMOST AS ROUGH AS THE ROUGHEST EPISODE OF ACTUAL CRIMINAL LIFE BUT THE PLAY SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN ACTED AND SOME TIME AFTER ITS PUBLICATION WHETSTONE HIMSELF
A MAN OF HONOUR YES I BELIEVE IT THEN AFTER AN INTERVAL COME MONSIEUR HE SAID GENTLY YOUR CASE IS NOT AS DESPERATE AS YOU SUPPOSE MY ALIETTE IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS THROUGH WHOM HEAVEN SOMETIMES WORKS MIRACLES
STIMULATED TO READ MORE CAREFULLY BY SHAKESPEARE'S OWN PROFOUNDER TOUCHES THE READER WILL NOTE THE VIVID REALITY THE SUBTLE INTERCHANGE OF LIGHT AND SHADE
WHICH IF THEY APPLY TO THE LITERATURE OF FACT
TO BE WORTH ETCHING OFF DAY BY DAY BY AN OBSERVER WELL INFORMED ON THE SUBJECT RECOGNISING IN HIMSELF THOUGH AS HIS ONE REAL FAULT THAT HE CAN TAKE NOTHING SERIOUSLY IN HEAVEN OR EARTH BERNARD DE VAUDRICOURT
AND NOT RAISING THE WHOLE OF HIS WORK TO AN EQUAL DEGREE OF INTENSITY HENCE PERHAPS SOME OF THAT DEPTH AND WEIGHTINESS WHICH MAKE THIS PLAY SO IMPRESSIVE AS WITH THE TRUE SEAL OF EXPERIENCE LIKE A FRAGMENT OF LIFE ITSELF
WHERE AFTER ALL WE MUST NEEDS MAKE THE MOST OF THINGS CRITICAL EFFORTS TO LIMIT ART A PRIORI BY ANTICIPATIONS REGARDING THE NATURAL INCAPACITY OF THE MATERIAL WITH WHICH THIS OR THAT ARTIST WORKS AS THE SCULPTOR WITH SOLID FORM
OF UNDERSTANDING AND BEING TOUCHED BY THE PRESENCE OF GREAT MATTERS IN SPITE OF THAT HAPPY LIGHTNESS OF HEART SO JEALOUSLY FENCED ABOUT
THE RANGE OF THE POETIC FORCE IN LITERATURE WAS EFFECTIVELY ENLARGED BY WORDSWORTH THE TRUE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROSE AND POETRY HE REGARDED AS THE ALMOST TECHNICAL OR ACCIDENTAL ONE OF THE ABSENCE OR PRESENCE OF METRICAL BEAUTY
BUT I HAVE READ ENOUGH OF IT TO KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS IN THAT PAST AGE HAD
ALL BEAUTY IS IN THE LONG RUN ONLY FINENESS OF TRUTH OR WHAT WE CALL EXPRESSION THE FINER ACCOMMODATION OF SPEECH TO THAT VISION WITHIN THE TRANSCRIPT OF HIS SENSE OF FACT RATHER THAN THE FACT
WHILE THEY APPLY INDIFFERENTLY TO VERSE AND PROSE SO FAR AS EITHER IS REALLY IMAGINATIVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF TRUE ART IN BOTH ALIKE
WITH HIS CURIOUS MORALISING ON LIFE AND DEATH AND ISABELLA IN HER FIRST MOOD OF RENUNCIATION
WAS NEEDED BY WORDSWORTH TO BREAK THROUGH THE CONSECRATED POETIC ASSOCIATIONS OF A CENTURY AND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS HIS THAT WAS TO BECOME IN A MEASURE THE LANGUAGE OF THE NEXT GENERATION BUT HE DID IT WITH THE TACT OF A SCHOLAR ALSO
BUT HIS PECULIAR SENSE OF FACT WHETHER PAST OR PRESENT DISMISSING THEN UNDER SANCTION OF WORDSWORTH THAT HARSHER OPPOSITION OF POETRY TO PROSE AS SAVOURING IN FACT OF THE ARBITRARY PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LAST CENTURY
BUT ALL DISINTERESTED LOVERS OF BOOKS WILL ALWAYS LOOK TO IT AS TO ALL OTHER FINE ART FOR A REFUGE A SORT OF CLOISTRAL REFUGE FROM A CERTAIN VULGARITY IN THE ACTUAL WORLD A PERFECT POEM LIKE LYCIDAS
MONSEIGNEUR I SAID I COME TO YOU YOU UNDERSTAND ME AS TO MY LAST RESOURCE WHAT I AM NOW DOING IS ALMOST AN ACT OF DESPAIR
ASSERT SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HUMOUR SOMETHING THAT COMES NOT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT BUT OF A VISION WITHIN SO GIBBON MOULDS HIS UNWIELDY MATERIAL TO A PRECONCEIVED VIEW
BECOMES A PLEADING A THEOREM NO LONGER BUT ESSENTIALLY AN APPEAL TO THE READER TO CATCH THE WRITER'S SPIRIT TO THINK WITH HIM IF ONE CAN OR WILL AN EXPRESSION NO LONGER OF FACT BUT OF HIS SENSE OF IT
THAT MIGHT SEEM A SHADE TOO SERIOUS FOR LIPS SO YOUTHFUL MY FATHER SHE PROCEEDED DIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WOUND HE HAD RECEIVED AT PATAY THAT MAY SHOW YOU THAT HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY BUT HE WAS NO LOVER OF HIS OWN AGE
NOT LESS PRECIOUS FOR THIS RELIEF IN THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE PIECE THAN FOR ITS OWN PECULIAR GRACES IS THE EPISODE OF MARIANA A CREATURE WHOLLY OF SHAKESPEARE'S INVENTION TOLD BY WAY OF INTERLUDE IN SUBDUED PROSE
IT DEALS NOT LIKE HAMLET WITH THE PROBLEMS WHICH BESET ONE OF EXCEPTIONAL TEMPERAMENT BUT WITH MERE HUMAN NATURE IT BRINGS BEFORE US A GROUP OF PERSONS
A CONDITION OF MIND LITTLE SUSCEPTIBLE OF THE RESTRAINT PROPER TO VERSE FORM SO THAT THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC VERSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAS BEEN LAWLESS VERSE AND SECONDLY AN ALL PERVADING NATURALISM
A SCHOLAR WRITING FOR THE SCHOLARLY HE WILL OF COURSE LEAVE SOMETHING TO THE WILLING INTELLIGENCE OF HIS READER
WE MIGHT SAY THAT THE ART OF THE SCHOLAR IS SUMMED UP IN THE OBSERVANCE OF THOSE REJECTIONS DEMANDED BY THE NATURE OF HIS MEDIUM THE MATERIAL HE MUST USE ALIVE TO THE VALUE OF AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH EVERY TERM FINDS ITS UTMOST DEGREE OF EXPRESSION
EMBRACING OTHERS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR MUSIC AND SONG THE LITTLE MIRROR OF EXISTENCE WHICH REFLECTS TO EACH FOR A MOMENT THE STAGE ON WHICH HE PLAYS IS BROKEN AT LAST BY A CAPRICIOUS ACCIDENT
TO MISUSE AND STILL AS LANGUAGE WAS MADE FOR MAN HE WILL BE NO AUTHORITY FOR CORRECTNESSES WHICH LIMITING FREEDOM OF UTTERANCE WERE YET BUT ACCIDENTS IN THEIR ORIGIN
THE LOOK OF YOUR HOUSE ITS STYLE ITS TONE AND KEEPING CARRIED ME TWO CENTURIES BACK SO COMPLETELY THAT I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
BETWEEN THE LAWS AND CHARACTERISTIC EXCELLENCES OF VERSE AND PROSE COMPOSITION ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO HAVE DWELT MOST EMPHATICALLY ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROSE AND VERSE PROSE AND POETRY
AND PROSE THUS ASSERTING ITSELF AS THE SPECIAL AND PRIVILEGED ARTISTIC FACULTY OF THE PRESENT DAY WILL BE HOWEVER CRITICS MAY TRY TO NARROW ITS SCOPE
BEHIND IT OF PERHAPS QUITE ALIEN ASSOCIATIONS JUST THERE IT MAY BE
THAN BY THE IMAGINARY PERSONS TO WHOM HE INTRODUCES US
STILL OPPOSING THE CONSTANT DEGRADATION OF LANGUAGE BY THOSE WHO USE IT CARELESSLY HE WILL NOT TREAT COLOURED GLASS AS IF IT WERE CLEAR AND WHILE HALF THE WORLD IS USING FIGURE UNCONSCIOUSLY
IT COMES CAPRICIOUSLY GIVING MANY AND LONG REPRIEVES TO BARNARDINE WHO HAS BEEN WAITING FOR IT NINE YEARS IN PRISON TAKING ANOTHER THENCE BY FEVER ANOTHER BY MISTAKE OF JUDGMENT
AS TO IDENTIFY IN PROSE WHAT WE CALL THE POETRY THE IMAGINATIVE POWER NOT TREATING IT AS OUT OF PLACE AND A KIND OF VAGRANT INTRUDER BUT BY WAY OF AN ESTIMATE OF ITS RIGHTS THAT IS
PRESCRIBING THE REJECTION OF MANY A NEOLOGY MANY A LICENSE MANY A GIPSY PHRASE WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF AS ACTUALLY EXPRESSIVE HIS APPEAL AGAIN IS TO THE SCHOLAR WHO HAS GREAT EXPERIENCE IN LITERATURE
AND NOT OF SPECIFIC ORNAMENT ONLY BUT OF ALL THAT LATENT COLOUR AND IMAGERY WHICH LANGUAGE AS SUCH CARRIES IN IT A LOVER OF WORDS FOR THEIR OWN SAKE TO WHOM NOTHING ABOUT THEM IS UNIMPORTANT
AND POSSIBLY SCHUMANN IN THE OPENING OF HIS C MAJOR FANTAISIE ARE AS INTIMATE AS PERSONAL AS THE F MINOR BALLADE WHICH IS AS SUBTLY DISTINCTIVE AS THE HANDS AND SMILE OF LISA GIOCONDA
YET THE WORK IS PLAYED TOO FAST AND HAS BEEN NICKNAMED THE DRUM POLONAISE LOSING IN MAJESTY AND FORCE BECAUSE OF THE VANITY OF VIRTUOSI THE OCTAVES IN E MAJOR ARE SPUN OUT AS IF SPEED WERE THE SOLE IDEA OF THIS EPISODE
MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT IT IS A SINISTER PAGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE INJUNCTION TO OPEN WITH PIANISSIMO ONE WISHES THAT THE SHRILL HIGH G FLAT
THE LURID HOUR THAT PRECEDES A HURRICANE
THERE ARE TRACES OF THE MASTER THROUGHOUT PARTICULARLY IN THE E FLAT MINOR TRIO BUT THERE ARE SOME VILE PROGRESSIONS AND AN AIR OF VULGARITY SURELY NOT CHOPIN'S THIS DANCE FORM SINCE THE DEATH OF THE GREAT COMPOSER HAS BEEN CHIEFLY DEVELOPED ON THE VIRTUOSO SIDE
IN THE COURT OF HENRY OF ANJOU IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AFTER HIS ELECTION TO THE POLISH THRONE THE POLONAISE WAS BORN AND THROVE IN THE HARDY WARLIKE ATMOSPHERE IT BECAME A DANCE POLITICAL AND HAD WORDS SET TO IT
POLITICALLY THE POLES AND CELTS RUB SHOULDERS NIECKS POINTS OUT THAT IF CHOPIN WAS A FLATTERING IDEALIST AS A NATIONAL POET AS A PERSONAL POET HE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING REALIST SO IN THE POLONAISES WE FIND TWO DISTINCT GROUPS
EHLERT ABOVE EVIDENTLY SEES A BALLROOM PICTURE OF BRILLIANCY WITH THE REGULATION TENDER AVOWAL
IN ONE THE OBJECTIVE MARTIAL SIDE PREDOMINATES IN THE OTHER IS CHOPIN THE MOODY MOURNFUL AND MOROSE BUT IN ALL THE POLISH ELEMENT PERVADES BARRING THE MAZURKAS THESE DANCES ARE THE MOST POLISH OF HIS WORKS
KLINDWORTH ATTACKS THE TRILL ON THE SECOND PAGE WITH THE UPPER TONE A FLAT KULLAK AND MERTKE IN THE STEINGRABER EDITION PLAY THE PASSAGE IN THIS MANNER
MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT AND WHAT COULD BE MORE EVOCATIVE OF DRAMATIC SUSPENSE THAN THE SIXTEEN BARS BEFORE THE MAD TERRIFYING CODA HOW THE SOLEMN SPLENDORS OF THE HALF NOTES WEAVE AN ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTIC TRAGEDY
THAN THE CHOPIN OF OP SEVENTY ONE REALLY A GRACEFUL AND EFFECTIVE LITTLE COMPOSITION OF THE FLORID ORDER BUT LIKE HIS EARLY MUSIC WITHOUT POETIC DEPTH THE WARSAW ECHO MUSICALE
THIS POLONAISE AT NO TIME EXHIBITS THE SOLIDITY OF ITS TWO PREDECESSORS ITS PLASTICITY DEFIES THE IMPRINT OF THE CONVENTIONAL POLONAISE THOUGH WE EVER FEEL ITS RHYTHMS IT MAY BE FULL OF MONOLOGUES INTERSPERSED CADENZAS
IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF CHOPIN'S BALLADE IN F MINOR IT HAS THREE REQUIREMENTS THE COMPREHENSION OF THE PROGRAMME AS A WHOLE FOR CHOPIN WRITES ACCORDING TO A PROGRAMME TO THE SITUATIONS IN LIFE BEST KNOWN TO AND UNDERSTOOD BY HIMSELF
IN G SHARP MINOR WAS COMPOSED LATER THAN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE DATE GIVEN IN THE BREITKOPF AND HARTEL EDITION IT IS AN ARTISTIC CONCEPTION AND IN LIGHT WINGED FIGURATION FAR MORE MATURE
IT IS REALLY IN THE KEYS OF F MAJOR A MINOR CHOPIN'S PSYCHOLOGY WAS SELDOM AT FAULT A MAJOR ENDING WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THIS EXTRAORDINARY TONE POEM WRITTEN CHOPIN ADMITS
BACH IN THE CHROMATIC FANTASIA BE NOT DECEIVED BY ITS CLASSICAL CONTOURS IT IS MUSIC HOT FROM THE SOUL BEETHOVEN IN THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE C SHARP MINOR SONATA
YET WE CANNOT ACCEPT UNCONDITIONALLY HIS STATEMENT THAT IN STRUCTURE CHOPIN IS A CHILD PLAYING WITH A FEW SIMPLE TYPES
THE FIELD FLOWER A RUSTIC MAIDEN THE WIND A KNIGHT I CAN FIND NO LACK OF AFFINITY BETWEEN THE ANDANTINO AND PRESTO THE SURPRISE IS A DRAMATIC ONE WITHAL RUDELY VIGOROUS
CHOPIN WROTE FIFTEEN POLONAISES THE AUTHENTICITY OF ONE IN G FLAT MAJOR BEING DOUBTED BY NIECKS
HIS PIANO IS SO SOFTLY BREATHED FORTH THAT HE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY STRONG FORTE TO PRODUCE THE WISHED FOR CONTRAST THIS G MINOR BALLADE WAS PUBLISHED IN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX AND IS DEDICATED TO BARON STOCKHAUSEN
THAT REVERBERATE WITH FORMIDABLE CLANGOR BY ALL MEANS READ LISZT'S GORGEOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE POLONAISE ORIGINATING DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS AT FIRST A MEASURED PROCESSION OF NOBLES AND THEIR WOMANKIND TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC
CHOPIN IN THE DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WAS SURPRISED TERRIFIED IS A BETTER WORD BY THE OPENING OF HIS DOOR AND THE ENTRANCE OF A LONG TRAIN OF POLISH NOBLES AND LADIES RICHLY ROBED WHO MOVED SLOWLY BY HIM
IN E FLAT MINOR IT IS VARIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE SIBERIAN THE REVOLT POLONAISE IT BREATHES DEFIANCE AND RANCOR FROM THE START WHAT SUPPRESSED AND THREATENING RUMBLINGS ARE THERE VOLCANIC MUTTERINGS THESE
AND SILVER SPUR THERE IS IMAGINATIVE SPLENDOR IN THIS THRILLING WORK WITH ITS THUNDER OF HORSES HOOFS AND FIERCE CHALLENGINGS WHAT FIRE WHAT SWORD THRUSTS AND SMOKE AND CLASH OF MORTAL CONFLICT
OF THE FOURTH AND GLORIOUS BALLADE IN F MINOR DEDICATED TO BARONNE C DE ROTHSCHILD I COULD WRITE A VOLUME IT IS CHOPIN IN HIS MOST REFLECTIVE YET LYRIC MOOD LYRISM IS THE KEYNOTE OF THE WORK
ON THE THIRD PAGE THIRD BAR HE USES F NATURAL IN THE TREBLE SO DOES KLINDWORTH ALTHOUGH F SHARP MAY BE FOUND IN SOME EDITIONS ON THE LAST PAGE SECOND BAR FIRST LINE KULLAK WRITES THE PASSAGE BEGINNING WITH E FLAT IN EIGHTH NOTES
GIVE TO THE A FLAT MAJOR POLONAISE THE HONOR OF SUGGESTING A WELL KNOWN STORY IT IS REALLY THE A MAJOR THAT PROVOKED IT SO THE POLISH PORTRAIT PAINTER KWIATOWSKI INFORMED NIECKS THE STORY RUNS THAT AFTER COMPOSING IT
FOLLOW KLECZYNSKI'S ADVICE AND DO NOT SACRIFICE THE POLONAISE TO THE OCTAVES KARL TAUSIG SO JOSEFFY AND DE LENZ ASSERT PLAYED THIS POLONAISE IN AN UNAPPROACHABLE MANNER POWERFUL BATTLE TABLEAU AS IT IS
IS IN THREE FOUR TIME WITH THE ACCENT ON THE SECOND BEAT OF THE BAR IN SIMPLE BINARY FORM TERNARY IF A TRIO IS ADDED THIS DANCE HAS FEMININE ENDINGS TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CADENCES THE RHYTHMICAL CAST OF THE BASS IS SELDOM CHANGED
THE INVERTED DOMINANT PEDAL IN THE C SHARP MINOR EPISODE REVEALS WITH THE MASSIVE CODA A GREAT MASTER KULLAK SUGGESTS SOME VARIANTS HE USES THE TRANSIENT SHAKE IN THE THIRD BAR INSTEAD OF THE APPOGGIATURA WHICH KLINDWORTH PREFERS
AND GIVES A D NATURAL IN THE AUGENER EDITION THAT HE IS WRONG INTERNAL TESTIMONY ABUNDANTLY PROVES EVEN WILLEBY WHO PERSONALLY PREFERS THE D NATURAL THINKS CHOPIN INTENDED THE E FLAT AND QUOTES A SIMILAR EFFECT TWENTY EIGHT BARS LATER
RATHER A SIGH BEFORE THE RIGOROUSLY LOGICAL IMITATIONS WHICH PRESAGE THE RE ENTRANCE OF THE THEME HOW WONDERFULLY THE INTRODUCTION COMES IN FOR ITS SHARE OF THOUGHTFUL TREATMENT WHAT A HARMONIST
THE PREVAILING MOODS ARE COQUETRY AND SWEET CONTENTMENT CONTRAPUNTAL SKILL IS SHOWN IN THE WORKING OUT SECTION CHOPIN ALWAYS WEARS HIS LEARNING LIGHTLY IT DOES NOT OPPRESS US
A FAC SIMILE REPRODUCTION OF A HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED POLONAISE IN A FLAT WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS UNIQUE NUMBER THIS TINY DANCE SHOWS IT IS SAID THE CHARACTERISTIC PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE COMPOSER IN REALITY
THE POLONAISES ARE THE KEYSTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORM THEY BELONG TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF CHOPIN INSPIRATIONS WITH THEIR ENERGETIC RHYTHM THEY ELECTRIFY TO THE POINT OF EXCITED DEMONSTRATION EVEN THE SLEEPIEST INDIFFERENTISM
DESPITE ITS ESSENTIALLY MASCULINE MOULD IT IS GIVEN A FEMININE TITLE FORMERLY
AT THE EIGHTH BAR AFTER THIS RETURN KULLAK ADHERES TO THE E INSTEAD OF F AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BAR TREBLE CLEF KLINDWORTH INDICATES BOTH NOR DOES KULLAK FOLLOW MIKULI IN USING A D IN THE CODA HE PREFERS A D SHARP INSTEAD OF A NATURAL
AND FINALLY A SILENCE THAT MARKS THE CESSATION OF AN AGITATING NIGHTMARE NO SABRE DANCE THIS BUT A CONFESSION FROM THE DARK DEPTHS OF A SELF TORTURED SOUL
PARTLY THROUGH AN UNDEFINABLE PECULIAR INBORN DISPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE RACE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLONAISE EVERYTHING CO OPERATED WHICH SPECIFICALLY DISTINGUISHED THE NATION FROM OTHERS IN THE POLES OF DEPARTED TIMES MANLY RESOLUTION WAS UNITED
BEETHOVEN SCHUBERT WEBER AND EVEN BACH IN HIS B MINOR SUITE FOR STRINGS AND FLUTE ALSO INDULGED IN THIS FORM WAGNER AS A STUDENT WROTE A POLONAISE FOR FOUR HANDS IN D AND IN SCHUMANN'S PAPILLONS
DE BEAUVAU THERE ARE FEW EDITORIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE EIGHTEENTH BAR FROM THE BEGINNING
THIS POLACCA IS THIN A TENTATIVE GROPING AFTER A FORM THAT LATER WAS MASTERED SO MAGNIFICENTLY BY THE COMPOSER
THERE IS NO DOUBT HE IDEALIZED HIS COUNTRY AND HER WRONGS
A FIELD FLOWER CAUGHT BY A GUST OF WIND A CARESSING OF THE FLOWER BY THE WIND THE RESISTANCE OF THE FLOWER THE STORMY STRUGGLE OF THE WIND THE ENTREATY OF THE FLOWER WHICH AT LAST LIES THERE BROKEN AND PARAPHRASED
THE EASE WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE WORK IS FLOATED PROVES THAT CHOPIN IN MENTAL HEALTH WAS NOT DAUNTED BY LARGER FORMS THERE IS MOONLIGHT IN THIS MUSIC AND SOME SUNLIGHT TOO
THERE IS LOFTINESS OF SPIRIT AND DARING IN IT WHAT CAN ONE SAY NEW OF THE TREMENDOUS F SHARP MINOR POLONAISE WILLEBY CALLS IT NOISY
SINCE DECEASED AND IN IT WITHOUT ANY QUESTION STANDS THE MUCH DISCUSSED E FLAT THIS TESTIMONY IS FINAL THE D NATURAL ROBS THE BAR OF ALL MEANING IT IS INSIPID COLORLESS KULLAK GIVES SIXTY TO THE HALF NOTE AT THE MODERATO
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN LIGHTS THE RUSSIAN VIRTUOSO WAS RIGHT HIS STRENGTH WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE TASK AND SO IMITATING CHOPIN HE TOPSY TURVIED THE SHADING IT RECALLED MOSCHELES DESCRIPTION OF CHOPIN'S PLAYING
THAT NONE BUT PSYCHICAL MEANINGS SHOULD BE READ INTO THEM THE DISPUTED PASSAGE IS ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF THE KULLAK EDITION AFTER THE TRILLS A MEASURE IS MISSING IN KULLAK WHO LIKE KLINDWORTH
IT IS REALLY A MARCH A PROCESSIONAL DANCE GRAVE MODERATE FLOWING AND BY NO MEANS STEREOTYPED LISZT TELLS OF THE CAPRICIOUS LIFE INFUSED INTO ITS COURTLY MEASURES BY THE POLISH ARISTOCRACY
THE LINGERING MENTIONED BY DE LENZ IS TEMPO RUBATO SO FATALLY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST CHOPIN PLAYERS DE LENZ IN A NOTE QUOTES MEYERBEER AS SAYING MEYERBEER WHO QUARRELLED WITH CHOPIN ABOUT THE RHYTHM OF A MAZURKA CAN ONE REDUCE WOMEN TO NOTATION
GIVING SOME THEMATIC WORK OF THE SLIGHTEST TEXTURE TO THE STRINGS AND IN THE PRETTY CODA TO THE WOOD WIND A DELICATELY MANAGED ALLUSION IS MADE BY THE HORNS TO THE SECOND THEME OF THE NOCTURNE IN G
WE HAVE SEEN THIS LEGEND DISPROVED BY ONE WHO KNOWS THIS POLONAISE IS NOT AS FEVERISH AND AS EXALTED AS THE PREVIOUS ONE IT IS AS KLECZYNSKI WRITES THE TYPE OF A WAR SONG
WHAT REMAINS WILL BELONG TO THE KITCHEN TO NATURAL HISTORY IT IS NOT OTHERWISE WITH CHOPIN THE BLOOM CONSISTED IN TAUSIG'S TREATMENT OF THE BALLADE HE CAME TO THE FIRST PASSAGE THE MOTIVE AMONG BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT CHOPIN CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT XAVER SCHARWENKA MADE A NEW INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS DISCREET AND EXTREMELY WELL SOUNDING WITH EXCELLENT TACT
THIS SOUL SUSPENSION RECALLS MAETERLINCK HERE IS THE EPISODE MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT A STORY OF DE LENZ THAT LENDS ITSELF TO QUOTATION IS ABOUT THIS PIECE TAUSIG IMPRESSED ME DEEPLY
THE FIGURATION SETS OFF THE IDEA IN DAZZLING RELIEF THERE ARE EPISODES TRANSITIONAL PASSAGE WORK DISTINGUISHED BY NOVELTY AND THE FINEST ART AT NO PLACE IS THERE DISPLAY FOR DISPLAY'S SAKE THE CADENZA IN A IS A PAUSE FOR BREATH
IT SWUNG ITSELF INTO THE HIGHER REGISTER WHERE IT CAME TO A STOP BEFORE A MAJOR JUST AS THE INTRODUCTION STOPPED BEFORE C MAJOR THEN AFTER THE THEME HAS ONCE MORE PRESENTED ITSELF IN A MODIFIED FORM VARIANT
IT IS PRECEDED BY AN INTRODUCTION AND IS DEDICATED TO JOSEPH MERK THE CELLIST CHOPIN HIMSELF PRONOUNCED IT A BRILLIANT SALON PIECE IT IS NOW NOT EVEN THAT FOR IT SOUNDS ANTIQUATED AND THREADBARE
IS PRE EMINENTLY TO BE RECOGNIZED THUS SCHUMANN FORSOOTH IT IS ARISTOCRATIC GAY GRACEFUL PIQUANT AND ALSO SOMETHING MORE EVEN IN ITS PLAYFUL MOMENTS THERE IS DELICATE IRONY
WHOM VANCE THOMPSON CHRISTENED A PRESTIDIGIOUS NOCTAMBULIST HAS LITERALLY STORMED OVER IT IT IS BARBARIC IT IS PERHAPS PATHOLOGIC AND OF IT LISZT HAS SAID MOST ELOQUENT THINGS IT IS FOR HIM A DREAM POEM
IN PHRASEOLOGY HE IS A MASTER WHOSE FELICITOUS PERFECTION OF STYLE IS ONE OF THE ABIDING TREASURES OF THE ART CHOPIN THEN ACCORDING TO HADOW
IS NOT EASILY DEFENSIBLE ON THE SCORE OF FORM YET IT UNMISTAKABLY FITS IN THE PICTURE THE MAZURKA IS FULL OF INTERROGATION AND EMOTIONAL NUANCIREN THE RETURN OF THE TEMPEST IS NOT LONG DELAYED
THE FIRST THREE LINES ARE HUGELY HEROIC BUT THE INDIGNATION SOON MELTS AWAY LEAVING AN APATHETIC HUMOR AFTER THE THEME RETURNS AND IS REPEATED WE GET A GENUINE LOVE MOTIF TENDER ENOUGH IN ALL FAITH WHEREWITH TO WOO A PRINCESS
IN THE WIDELY REMOTE KEY OF E FLAT IT IS BRILLIANT EVERY NOTE TELLING THE FIGURATION RICH AND NOVEL THE MOVEMENT SPIRITED AND FLOWING PERHAPS IT IS TOO LONG AND LACKS RELIEF THE THEME ON EACH RE ENTRANCE IS
IT BURSTS WANES AND WITH THE CODA COMES SAD YEARNING THEN THE SAVAGE DRAMA PASSES TREMBLINGLY INTO THE NIGHT AFTER FLUID AND WAVERING AFFIRMATIONS A ROAR IN F SHARP
THE PIECE HAS NOT YET BEGUN IN HIS FIRMER NOBLY EXPRESSIVE EXPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL THEME FREE FROM SENTIMENTALITY TO WHICH ONE MIGHT EASILY YIELD THE GRAND STYLE FOUND DUE SCOPE
FILLS OUT AN OCTAVE NOT SO IN KLINDWORTH NOR IN THE ORIGINAL AT THE TWENTIETH BAR KLINDWORTH DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL AS FOLLOWS THE CHOPIN TEXT IS THE UPPER ONE MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPTS
WITH GLOWING DEVOTION TO THE OBJECT OF THEIR LOVE THEIR KNIGHTLY HEROISM WAS SANCTIONED BY HIGH SOARING DIGNITY AND EVEN THE LAWS OF GALLANTRY AND THE NATIONAL COSTUME EXERTED AN INFLUENCE OVER THE TURNS OF THIS DANCE
CHOPIN INTRODUCED IT AT A CONSERVATOIRE CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF HABENECK APRIL TWENTY SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE THIS ACCORDING TO NIECKS WAS THE ONLY TIME HE PLAYED THE POLONAISE WITH ORCHESTRAL ACCOMPANIMENT
WHOSE APPEARANCE IN THE PIECE IS WELL EXPLAINED BY THE PROGRAMME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT THE CODA IN MODULATED HARP TONES CAME TO A STOP BEFORE A FERMATA WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THOSE BEFORE MENTIONED
CAN ANYTHING BE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THIS OPENING MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT IT IS INDEED POLAND'S DOWNFALL THE TRIO IN A FLAT WITH ITS KALEIDOSCOPIC MODULATIONS PRODUCES AN IMPRESSION OF VAGUE UNREST AND SUPPRESSED SORROW
THERE IS NO GREATER TEST FOR THE POET PIANIST THAN THE F SHARP MINOR POLONAISE IT IS PROFOUNDLY IRONICAL WHAT ELSE MEANS THE INTRODUCTION OF THAT LOVELY MAZURKA A FLOWER BETWEEN TWO ABYSSES
YET HE DID NOT ALWAYS INDICATE THE SALIENT OUTLINES OF HIS ART ONLY THE SLAV MAY HOPE TO UNDERSTAND CHOPIN THOROUGHLY
THERE IS THE TALL LILY IN THE FOUNTAIN THAT NODS TO THE SUN IT DRIPS IN CADENCED MONOTONE AND ITS SONG IS REPEATED ON THE LIPS OF THE SLENDER HIPPED GIRL WITH THE EYES OF MIDNIGHT AND SO MIGHT I WEAVE FOR YOU A STORY OF WHAT I SEE IN THE BALLADE
HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN FULL CHORDS AS THE THEME SUFFERS FROM A WANT OF MASSIVENESS THEN FOLLOWS A SUBSIDIARY BUT THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT RETURNS RELENTLESSLY THE EPISODE IN B MAJOR GIVES PAUSE FOR BREATHING
A WHIRLWIND I HAVE CALLED IT ELSEWHERE IT IS A STORM OF THE EMOTIONS MUSCULAR IN ITS VIRILITY I REMEMBER DE PACHMANN A CLOSE INTERPRETER OF CERTAIN SIDES OF CHOPIN PLAYING THIS CODA PIANO PIANISSIMO AND PRESTISSIMO
IT HAS A HINT OF MEYERBEER BUT AGAIN WITH SMOTHERED EXPLOSIONS THE POLONAISE PROPER APPEARS AND ALL ENDS IN GLOOM AND THE IMPOTENT CLANKING OF CHAINS IT IS AN AWE PROVOKING WORK
IN THEM HE ATTAINS THE ACME OF HIS POWER AS AN ARTIST REMARKS NIECKS I AM EVER REMINDED OF ANDREW LANG'S LINES
IS THE WRITER OF THE FOREGOING THE SECOND BALLADE ALTHOUGH DEDICATED TO ROBERT SCHUMANN DID NOT EXCITE HIS WARMEST PRAISE A LESS ARTISTIC WORK THAN THE FIRST HE WROTE BUT EQUALLY FANTASTIC AND INTELLECTUAL
HERE IS THE DUALITY OF CHOPIN THE SUFFERING MAN AND CHOPIN THE PROPHET OF POLAND UNDIMMED IS HIS POETIC VISION POLAND WILL BE FREE UNDAUNTED HIS SOUL THOUGH OPPRESSED BY A SUFFERING BODY
THERE IS A CHARMING SPECIMEN RUBINSTEIN COMPOSED A MOST BRILLIANT AND DRAMATIC EXAMPLE IN E FLAT IN LE BAL THE LISZT POLONAISES ALL SAID AND DONE ARE THE MOST REMARKABLE IN DESIGN AND EXECUTION SINCE CHOPIN
THIS STRANGE DANCE IS USHERED IN BY TWO OF THE MOST ENIGMATIC PAGES OF CHOPIN
NONE BUT THE HEROES OF THE KEYBOARD MAY GRASP ITS DENSE CHORDAL MASSES ITS FIERY PROJECTILES OF TONE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING DISTURBING EVEN GHOSTLY IN THE STRANGE INTERMEZZO THAT SEPARATES THE TRIO FROM THE POLONAISE BOTH MIST AND STARLIGHT ARE IN IT
TROUBLED BY THE GHOSTS OF THE PAST HE HAD RAISED THE COMPOSER HOLLOW EYED FLED THE APARTMENT
TO MY MIND THIS REPETITION ADDS EMPHASIS ALTHOUGH IT IS A FORMAL BLUR AND WHAT AN IRRESISTIBLE MOMENT IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL TERRITORY BEFORE THE DARKER MOOD OF THE C SHARP MINOR PART IS REACHED
A SPIRITUAL SPORTING WITH GRAVER AND MORE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS THOSE BROKEN OCTAVES WHICH USHER IN EACH TIME THE SECOND THEME WITH ITS FASCINATING INFECTIOUS RHYTHMICAL LILT WHAT AN IRONICALLY JOYOUS FILLIP THEY GIVE THE IMAGINATION
DO NOT FEAR ME FOR IT MAY BE THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND AT HAND THOUGH YOU DO NOT THINK IT HE MUST BE SENT FROM THE SKY THEN SAID ONE OF THEM WITH A GRAVE LOOK AND HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT TO ME AT THE SAME TIME
AND TRY IF THEY COULD NOT SEIZE SOME OF THEM AND BRING THEM HOME AS SLAVES SO AS TO MAKE THEM DO THE HARD PART OF THEIR WORK FOR THEM THE CHIEF GAVE THEM ALL THE ARMS AND STORES THAT THEY COULD WANT AND A LARGE BOAT TO GO IN
ONE OF THESE BEASTS CAME NEAR OUR BOAT SO I LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM WITH MY GUN AND AS SOON AS THE BRUTE WAS IN RANGE I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD TWICE HE SANK DOWN IN THE SEA AND TWICE HE CAME UP
BUT AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT WE WERE AT HAND TO TAKE A GREAT PRIZE FOR THEM FOR TWO WILD BEASTS OF THE SAME KIND AS THE FIRST I SPOKE OF CAME IN FULL CHASE FROM THE HILLS DOWN TO THE SEA
IT WOULD BE A HARD TASK FOR ME TO SET FORTH IN WORDS THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN MY SHIP WHEN THE POOR FRENCH FOLK FOR SUCH THEY WERE CAME ON BOARD AS TO GRIEF AND FEAR THESE ARE SOON TOLD SIGHS TEARS AND GROANS MAKE UP THE SUM OF THEM
THEY THEN FELL TO BLOWS AND HARD WORDS BUT CARL HAD THEM BOUND IN CORDS AND TOOK THEIR ARMS FROM THEM THE MEN OF SPAIN THEN SAID THEY WOULD DO THEM NO HARM AND IF THEY WOULD LIVE AT PEACE THEY WOULD HELP THEM
THEN DO THEY MOUNT TO THE SKY AND FROM THENCE GO DOWN TO THE DEEP MY SOUL FAINTS I REEL TO AND FRO AND AM AT MY WIT'S END
GOD WHO SHAPES OUR WAYS AND LED ME BY THE HAND THEN CAN SAVE ME FROM THIS STATE NOW
SHE HAD SIX GUNS TWELVE MEN AND A BOY WE TOOK WITH US SAWS CHAINS TOYS BEADS BITS OF GLASS
CARL TOLD ME THAT HE FELT SURE I SHOULD SAY THERE WAS MUCH NEED OF THEM WHEN I HEARD HOW THEY HAD SPENT THEIR TIME SINCE THEY HAD COME TO THE ISLE
FOR WITH HIS QUICK EYE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF OLD JAF IT BROUGHT THE TEARS TO OUR EYES TO SEE HIS JOY WHEN HE MET THE OLD MAN HE GAVE HIM A KISS TOOK HIM UP IN HIS ARMS SET HIM DOWN IN THE SHADE THEN STOOD A SHORT WAY OFF TO LOOK AT HIM
BUT IF THEY WERE IN THE VALE AND I ON HIGH GROUND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME THE FIRST GOAT I SHOT HAD A KID BY HER SIDE AND WHEN THE OLD ONE FELL
THEN THE LORD BRINGS ME OUT OF ALL MY FEARS
THUS MY FRIENDS WERE SET FREE FROM ALL THEIR FEARS AND SAW NO MORE OF THEIR WILD FOES FOR SOME TIME ONE DAY A WHIM TOOK THE THREE BAD MEN THAT THEY WOULD GO TO THE MAIN LAND FROM WHENCE THE WILD MEN CAME
THE HEART OF EACH NOW GREW FAINT OUR CHEEKS WERE PALE AND OUR EYES WERE DIM FOR THERE WAS BUT ONE HOPE AND THAT WAS TO FIND SOME BAY AND SO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LAND
AT LENGTH I MET WITH A MAN WHOSE CASE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS MY OWN AND WE BOTH TOOK SOME LAND TO FARM MY STOCK LIKE HIS WAS LOW BUT WE MADE OUR FARMS SERVE TO KEEP US IN FOOD
FOR FEAR OF BEASTS OF PREY AS WELL AS SNAKES BUT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THESE FEARS AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND I PUT THE CHESTS AND BOARDS ROUND ME AS WELL AS I COULD
HIS WHINE HIS GROWL AND HIS TRICKS HE WOULD ALL BUT TALK TO ME
AND I SOON GAVE UP ALL DULL THOUGHTS
NO NO SAID HE NO MORE NO NO MORE AS WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME MEN AT THE TOP OF THE HILL I GAVE WORD TO FIRE THREE GUNS TO SHOW THAT WE WERE FRIENDS
WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD THE LAD CRY OUT A SHIP WITH A SAIL A SHIP WITH A SAIL
THE LAND IN FRONT OF US RAN OUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES LIKE A BILL AND WE HAD TO KEEP SOME WAY FROM THE COAST TO MAKE THIS POINT SO THAT WE LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORE
FRIDAY TOLD THEM THAT PAUL WAS THERE WITH THE KING OF THE ISLE WHO HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM A CROWD OF MEN AT THIS ONE OF THE CREW SAID IF PAUL WILL SPARE OUR LIVES WE WILL YIELD THEN SAID FRIDAY YOU SHALL KNOW THE KING'S WILL
NOW LIFT UP MY HANDS NOW FOLD THEM ON MY BREAST AND THANK GOD FOR ALL THAT HE HAD DONE FOR ME WHEN THE REST OF THE MEN WERE LOST
AND TO WORK ONCE MORE TILL THE SUN HAD SET AND THEN TO BED
AS SOON AS I FOUND THIS OUT I SENT THE LONG BOAT ON SHORE WITH TWELVE MEN AND THE MATE AND OFF THEY WENT TO SEEK THE TWO WHO HAD LEFT THE SHIP BUT THEIR SEARCH WAS IN VAIN NOR COULD THEY FIND ONE OF THE REST
WHICH SAT ON ONE OF THE CHESTS WHEN I CAME UP I HELD MY GUN AT HER BUT AS SHE DID NOT KNOW
WHEN I WAS DEAD AND GONE AS TO GET RID OF MY OWN THOUGHTS AND DRAW ME FROM THE FEARS WHICH ALL DAY LONG DWELT ON MY MIND
HE CAME UP TO ME AND WITH MUCH WARMTH SHOOK MY HANDS AND THEN TOOK ME TO MY OLD HOUSE WHICH HE NOW GAVE UP TO ME I COULD NO MORE HAVE FOUND THE PLACE THAN IF I HAD NOT BEEN THERE AT ALL THE ROWS OF TREES STOOD SO THICK AND CLOSE
SO THEY GAVE THEIR GOOD HOSTS AN AXE AN OLD KEY AND A KNIFE AND BROUGHT OFF THE SLAVES IN THEIR BOAT TO THE ISLE
WELL SAID I
AND WHEN THEY HAD COME ON SHORE THEY LAY ON THE GROUND IN THE SHADE OF A TREE I WAS SOON AT THEIR SIDE FOR THEIR LOOKS SO SAD AND WORN BROUGHT TO MY MIND THE FIRST FEW HOURS I HAD SPENT IN THIS WILD SPOT
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE SAID I THERE IN THE WOOD CLOSE BY I FEAR THEY MAY HAVE SEEN AND HEARD US IF THEY HAVE THEY WILL BE SURE TO KILL US ALL HAVE THEY FIRE ARMS THEY HAVE FOUR GUNS ONE OF WHICH IS IN THE BOAT
OF COURSE THAT I WAS DEAD THEY HAD NOT LEFT ME THEIR WEALTH AND LANDS
THE SKIN OF WHICH MADE ME A CAP
THERE WERE A YOUTH AND A YOUNG GIRL IN THE SHIP WHO THE MATE SAID HE THOUGHT MUST BE DEAD BUT HE HAD NOT HAD THE HEART TO GO NEAR THEM FOR THE FOOD WAS ALL GONE
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO POINT TO THE SHIP AND WITH MUCH WARMTH TOOK ME TO HIS ARMS AND SAID MY DEAR FRIEND THERE IS YOUR SHIP FOR SHE IS ALL YOURS AND SO ARE WE AND ALL THAT IS IN HER
THAT AT FIRST THE WAVES HID IT BY THE HELP OF THIS ROPE I GOT ON BOARD I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A BULGE IN THE SHIP AND THAT SHE HAD SPRUNG A LEAK
HERE I HAD WELL NIGH LOST MY FREIGHT FOR THE SHORE LAY ON A SLOPE SO THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO LAND ON SAVE WHERE ONE END OF THE RAFT WOULD LIE SO HIGH AND ONE END SO LOW
NOW THAT I HAD TWO FREIGHTS OF GOODS AT HAND I MADE A TENT WITH THE SHIP'S SAILS TO STOW THEM IN AND CUT THE POLES FOR IT FROM THE WOOD
YET THE WISH TO GO BACK TO MY WILD HAUNTS CLUNG ROUND ME LIKE A CLOUD AND I COULD IN NO WAY DRIVE IT FROM ME SO TRUE IS IT THAT WHAT IS BRED IN THE BONE WILL NOT COME OUT OF THE FLESH
A CALM SEA A TIDE WHICH SET IN TO THE SHORE AND A SLIGHT BREEZE TO BLOW ME THERE I HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO FIND SOME OARS IN A PART OF THE SHIP IN WHICH I HAD MADE NO SEARCH TILL NOW
AND THIS BROUGHT ON A FIGHT THE END OF WHICH WAS THAT THE THREE MEN HAD TO STAND OFF BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY CAME BACK AND TROD DOWN THE CORN AND SHOT THE GOATS AND YOUNG KIDS WHICH THE POOR MEN HAD GOT TO BRING UP TAME FOR THEIR STORE
I HAD BUT A KNIFE AND A PIPE IT NOW GREW DARK
AND A GUST OF WIND WOULD MAKE ALL MY STORE SLIDE OFF
AND WHEN IT HAD GONE OFF I SAT QUITE STILL ON THE GROUND FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
NOW THOU SHALT DIE THEN I WOKE AND FOUND IT WAS A DREAM WEAK AND FAINT I WAS IN DREAD ALL DAY LEST MY FIT SHOULD COME ON
YOU MAY GUESS HOW FOND I WAS OF THEM FOR THEY WERE ALL THE FRIENDS LEFT TO ME I BROUGHT THE DOG AND TWO CATS FROM THE SHIP THE DOG WOULD FETCH THINGS FOR ME AT ALL TIMES AND BY HIS BARK
THERE WAS TOO SOME RUM OF WHICH I TOOK A GOOD DRAUGHT AND THIS GAVE ME HEART WHAT I STOOD MOST IN NEED OF WAS A BOAT TO TAKE THE GOODS TO SHORE
I COULD BUT CRY OUT IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALM THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS THESE MEN SEE THE WORKS OF THE LORD IN THE DEEP FOR AT HIS WORD THE STORMS RISE
ROUND ME AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE KIND FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HERE IN HIS SHIP NOW MEANT TO LEAVE THESE SHORES ON MY FIRST START TO SEA WHEN A BOY
AND THEN MY HEAD SHOT OUT AT THE TOP OF THE WAVES THIS GAVE ME HEART AND BREATH TOO AND SOON MY FEET FELT THE GROUND I STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A SHORT TIME TO LET THE SEA RUN BACK FROM ME
BUT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE THE ONE WHICH OUR TWO FRIENDS HAD GONE OUT IN FOR IT WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ISLE FOR THAT I SAW TOO THROUGH MY GLASS A SHIP OUT AT SEA THERE WERE TWELVE MEN IN THE BOAT THREE OF WHOM WERE BOUND IN CHAINS
WHILE FROM MY HOUSE NO SHIPS COULD COME ON MY SIDE OF THE ISLE AND NOT BE SEEN BY ME YET THE COOL SOFT BANKS WERE SO SWEET AND NEW TO ME THAT MUCH OF MY TIME WAS SPENT THERE
FOR I HAD MADE A LARGE SUM
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY WE FOUND BY THE AID OF THE GLASS THAT TWO OF THE SHIP'S BOATS WERE OUT AT SEA QUITE FULL OF MEN THEY HAD SEEN US AND HAD DONE THEIR BEST TO MAKE US SEE THEM AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE CAME UP WITH THEM
NOW I SHALL NOT STARVE FOR I FOUND FOUR LARGE GUNS BUT HOW WAS MY RAFT TO BE GOT TO LAND I HAD NO SAIL NO OARS
LIKE A BIRD IN A STORM THEN ALL THE GLEE I FELT AT FIRST LEFT ME
AND KILL AS FEW AS I COULD I TOLD TWO OF MY MEN TO CREEP ON THEIR HANDS AND FEET CLOSE TO THE GROUND SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SEEN AND WHEN THEY GOT UP TO THE MEN NOT TO FIRE TILL I GAVE THE WORD THEY HAD NOT STOOD THUS LONG WHEN THREE OF THE CREW CAME UP TO US
THEY WERE FULL OF SPITE AND CAME ONE DAY TO TEASE AND VEX THEM THEY TOLD THEM THAT THE ISLE WAS THEIR OWN AND THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO BUILD ON IT IF THEY DID NOT PAY RENT THE TWO GOOD MEN THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THEY WERE IN JEST
FOR THEY HAD ALL FLED TO THE WOODS WHEN THEY SAW THE BOAT WE HAD NOW LOST FIVE OF THE CREW BUT THE THREE FIRST WERE SO MUCH WORSE THAN THE LAST TWO THAT IN A FEW DAYS THEY SENT THEM OUT OF DOORS AND WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THEM
HAD COME ON SHORE SO THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO SEND FRIDAY TO FETCH FROM IT THE OARS THE SAIL AND THE GUN AND NOW THE SHIP MIGHT BE SAID TO BE IN OUR HANDS WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE MEN TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP THEY WERE IN A GREAT RAGE
BUT RAIN FELL ALL THAT NIGHT AND A GREAT PART OF THE NEXT DAY NOW THOUGH QUITE WORN OUT I HAD TO MOVE MY GOODS WHICH WERE IN THE CAVE TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND THEN JUST SWAM TO THE LAND WHERE HE FELL DOWN DEAD THE MEN WERE IN AS MUCH FEAR AT THE SOUND OF MY GUN AS THEY HAD BEEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE BEASTS BUT WHEN I MADE SIGNS FOR THEM TO COME TO THE SHORE
THIS DONE I PUT SHELVES ON EACH SIDE TO HOLD MY GOODS WHICH MADE MY CAVE LOOK LIKE A SHOP FULL OF STORES TO MAKE THESE SHELVES I CUT DOWN A TREE AND WITH THE HELP OF A SAW AN AXE A PLANE
SO NOW I HAD EIGHT MORE ON BOARD MY SHIP THAN I HAD WHEN I FIRST SET OUT IN THREE MONTHS FROM THE TIME WHEN I LEFT HOME I CAME IN SIGHT OF MY ISLE AND I BROUGHT THE SHIP SAFE UP
AND IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH BLADES OF RICE CORN AND RYE SPRANG UP AS TIME WENT BY AND THE GRAIN WAS RIPE I KEPT IT AND TOOK CARE TO SOW IT EACH YEAR
AND HAD SEEN NO WILD MEN I MADE A GUESS
THEY SOON LEARNED TO DIG AND PLANT AND HEDGE IN THEIR LAND IN THE MODE WHICH I HAD SET FOR THEM AND IN SHORT TO LEAD GOOD LIVES SO THAT I SHALL NOW CALL THEM THE TWO GOOD MEN BUT WHEN THE THREE BAD MEN SAW THIS
LORD LOOK ON ME WOULD I CRY FOR HOURS AT LAST THE FIT LEFT ME AND I SLEPT
WHICH WAS ON BOARD AND CUT A MAST IN THREE LENGTHS AND THESE GAVE GREAT STRENGTH TO THE RAFT I FOUND SOME BREAD AND RICE A DUTCH CHEESE AND SOME DRY GOAT'S FLESH THERE HAD BEEN SOME WHEAT
AT THE SOUND OF THE GUNS I CAME UP BUT IT WAS SO DARK THAT THE MEN COULD NOT TELL IF THERE WERE THREE OF US OR THREE SCORE IT FELL OUT JUST AS I COULD WISH FOR I HEARD THE MEN ASK TO WHOM MUST WE YIELD AND WHERE ARE THEY
BUT HOW WAS I TO GET ON DECK I HAD SWAM TWICE ROUND THE SHIP WHEN A PIECE OF ROPE CAUGHT MY EYE
I HAD TO GO TO BED AT DUSK TILL I MADE A LAMP OF GOAT'S FAT WHICH I PUT IN A CLAY DISH AND THIS
BUT I HAD MADE IT FAR TOO LARGE FOR IN COURSE OF TIME THE EARTH FELL IN FROM THE ROOF
AND THIS TOOK UP THE REST OF THE DAY WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT
SO MUCH FOR THE SAD VIEW OF MY CASE BUT LIKE MOST THINGS IT HAD A BRIGHT SIDE AS WELL AS A DARK ONE FOR HERE WAS I SAFE ON LAND
AS I HAD FOUND A USE FOR THE BAG WHICH HAD HELD THE FOWL'S FOOD ON BOARD SHIP I SHOOK OUT FROM IT THE HUSKS OF CORN THIS WAS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE GREAT RAINS FELL
TOO ILL TO GET OUT WITH MY GUN I SAT ON THE SHORE TO THINK
AND I WAS SAFE I NOW CAST MY EYES ROUND ME
THE SKY TOO WAS CLEAR AND THE SEA CALM
AND SUCH LIKE GOODS MY AUNT HAD PUT A FEW POUNDS IN MY FRIEND'S HANDS AS A GIFT TO HIM
THE MEN SPOKE TO US IN FRENCH
THAT THE HOUSE COULD NOT BE GOT AT SAVE BY SUCH BLIND WAYS AS NONE BUT THOSE WHO MADE THEM COULD FIND OUT WHY HAVE YOU BUILT ALL THESE FORTS SAID I
AT DAWN OF DAY I PUT MY HEAD OUT AND CAST MY EYES ON THE SEA WHEN LO NO SHIP WAS THERE
MY EYES FELL ON FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE FOR MY GOOD AT THIS TIME SO WELL DID THEY CHEER MY FAINT HOPES AND TOUCH THE TRUE SOURCE OF MY FEARS
WHERE ALL TO ME WAS WRAPT IN GLOOM I WENT UP TO THESE MEN AND SAID WHO ARE YOU SIRS THEY GAVE A START AT MY VOICE AND AT MY STRANGE DRESS AND MADE A MOVE AS IF THEY WOULD FLY FROM ME I SAID
AND THEN I SET OFF WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO THE SHORE
THAT I MIGHT LAY UP A STORE THE VALE ON THE BANKS OF WHICH THEY GREW WAS FRESH AND GREEN
AND HEARD THE SOUNDS OF MEN NOT OF ONE OR TWO BUT OF A GREAT CROWD WE NEED NOT DOUBT THAT THE CHIEF AND THE MAN WITH HIM NOW RAN BACK AT ONCE TO TELL ALL THE REST WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS
I THOUGHT THE TOP OF SOME HIGH TREE WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO KEEP ME OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THAT THERE I MIGHT SIT AND THINK OF DEATH FOR AS YET I HAD NO HOPES OF LIFE
AND SOME MORE TOOLS I MADE BOARDS A CHAIR AND A DESK TO WRITE ON CAME NEXT I ROSE IN GOOD TIME AND SET TO WORK TILL NOON THEN I ATE MY MEAL
AND WITH THIS SUM HE WAS SO KIND AS TO BUY ME A SLAVE IN THE MEAN TIME I HAD BOUGHT A SLAVE SO NOW I HAD TWO
BUT JUST THEN THE CURVE OF A HUGE WAVE ROSE UP AS HIGH AS A HILL AND THIS I HAD NO STRENGTH TO KEEP FROM SO IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE SEA
AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEY CAME BACK WITH SOME DRY MEAT AND A SORT OF CORN WHICH IS GROWN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
IT MUST BE HE WHO GUIDES THEM AND IF SO
THE RAIN FELL FOR SOME DAYS AND A COLD CHILL CAME ON ME IN SHORT I WAS ILL I HAD PAINS IN MY HEAD AND COULD GET NO SLEEP AT NIGHT
BUT IN THIS TIME OF NEED I HAD THE LUCK TO FIND MY GOOD FRIEND WHO ONCE TOOK ME UP AT SEA HE WAS NOW GROWN TOO OLD FOR WORK AND HAD PUT HIS SON IN THE SHIP IN HIS PLACE HE DID NOT KNOW ME AT FIRST
I GAVE THEM ALL SOME FOOD WHICH THEY ATE LIKE WOLVES IN THE SNOW BUT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO CHECK THEM AS I HAD FEARS THAT SO MUCH ALL AT ONCE WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM
AND TOLD THEM TO COME AND SIT DOWN AND SEE WHAT FINE HOMES THEY HAD BUILT AND SAY WHAT RENT THEY WOULD ASK
TILL AT LAST HE BECAME QUITE TIRED OF SUCH A WRETCHED LIFE AND DETERMINED TO GO AND TRY HIS LUCK IN ANOTHER COUNTRY HE INFORMED HIS WIFE OF HIS INTENTION
AND TAKING A SWORD IN HIS HAND RUSHED TO THE PRINCE WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING HIM BUT HE ROSE UP AND SPOKE DO NOT SLAY ME HE SAID WHAT PROFIT WOULD YOU GET FROM MY DEATH IF YOU KILLED ME YOU WOULD BE SORRY AFTERWARDS
WHERE HE FOUND HIM LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE DEAD ALAS ALAS HE CRIED AND LIFTING UP THE PRINCE HE POURED SOME WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE ALAS
MY HUSBAND A THOUSAND THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR BRINGING ME TO YOU SAID THE PRINCE THEN THE PRINCE AND GULIZAR BETROTHED THEMSELVES TO ONE ANOTHER AND PARTED THE ONE FOR THE HUT
THESE TWO MEN BELONGED TO A FAMILY OF ROBBERS THERE WERE ELEVEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER ONE AN ELDER SISTER STAYED AT HOME AND COOKED THE FOOD AND THE OTHER TEN ALL BROTHERS
IN THE MORNING THERE WAS GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION IN THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE
WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS CRUEL THING I SHOT AN ARROW AT A BIRD THAT WAS SITTING ON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN YONDER HOUSE AND MISSED ANSWERED THE PRINCE
WENT TO THE BANIYA AND THE BAKER AND THE BUTCHER TO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR DINNER FOR SOME REASON HE WAS DELAYED PERHAPS THE TSUT WAS NOT QUITE READY OR THE BANIYA
AND THE VIZIER'S SON ATTENDED BY A TROOP OF SOLDIERS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF CAMELS AND HORSES BEARING VERY MUCH TREASURE LEFT FOR THEIR OWN LAND
HAVE TAKEN UP THEIR ABODE IN MY HUT AND DEMAND SO MUCH OF MY ATTENTION IT IS NOTHING BUT COOKING AND CLEANING AND CLEANING AND COOKING ALL DAY LONG I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE MEN SHE ADDED
THAT HAD BEEN BURIED A FEW DAYS AGO AND BEGAN TO EAT IT ON SEEING THIS
AND AT ONCE ORDERED THE PRINCESS'S BACK TO BE EXAMINED IT IS SO SAID THE MAID SERVANT THE BURN IS THERE THEN LET THE GIRL BE SLAIN IMMEDIATELY THE KING SHOUTED NO NO YOUR MAJESTY THEY REPLIED
AND BEAT HER BACK WITH A SHOVEL WHICH LAY ON THE FIRE AT THE TIME WHILE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME HER NECKLACE GOT LOOSE AND DROPPED YOU WONDER AT THESE WORDS BUT THEY ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO PROVE
ASSEMBLED AND MARCHED BY THE HOUSE OF THE MERCHANT BY CHANCE FOR THEY BOTH HAD BEEN EXCUSED FROM OBEYING THIS ORDER THE KING'S SON
OR SICKNESS ATTACK HIM AND THEN SHE WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF HIM SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT SEEING HIM THE PRINCE SHOWED HER THAT THERE WAS NO REAL CAUSE FOR FEAR AND SAID THAT HE FELT HE OUGHT TO RETURN TO HIS FRIEND AT NIGHT
THROWING HIS ARMS ROUND THE PRINCE'S NECK BECAUSE I CANNOT LET YOU GO ALONE WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER WE WILL BE EXILED TOGETHER AND WE WILL DIE TOGETHER TURN ME NOT BACK IF YOU LOVE ME CONSIDER
A POTTER'S SON MARRYING A PRINCESS AND WE CRY AT THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE MARRIAGE WHAT CAN WE DO TRULY A MATTER FOR LAUGHING AND WEEPING BUT WEEP NO MORE SAID THE PRINCE
AS SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW ON HEARING THIS THE MERCHANT WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HIS MAJESTY WAS MUCH ENRAGED AT SUCH AUDACIOUS WICKEDNESS
LIKE THAT MAN WHO KILLED HIS DOG WHAT MAN WHAT DOG HE ASKED I WILL TELL YOU SAID THE PRINCE IF YOU WILL GIVE ME THAT SWORD SO HE GAVE HIM THE SWORD AND THE PRINCE BEGAN HIS STORY
TOOK UP SOME OF THE WATER IN HIS HAND FORTUNATELY HE LOOKED INTO HIS HAND BEFORE DRINKING AND THERE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT HE SAW REFLECTED WHOLE AND CLEAR THE IMAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL
OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT WILDLY THANK GOD EXCLAIMED
BY A SECRET DOOR BUT WHERE ARE THE HORSES AND THE GOODS
THE MERCHANT HIMSELF NEARLY WENT MAD MEANWHILE THE DOG KEPT ON RUNNING TO THE DOOR AND PULLING AT HIS MASTER'S SHIRT AND PAIJAMAS AS THOUGH WISHING HIM TO GO OUTSIDE AT LAST A FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT
LISTEN THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO SEE HER I ENTREAT YOU TO TAKE SOME SNOW WITH YOU AND JUST BEFORE SEEING THE PRINCESS PUT A LITTLE OF IT INTO BOTH YOUR EYES IT WILL PROVOKE TEARS
WERE ALSO IN THE COMPANY AND PASSED BY IN THE CROWD THEY CAME TO SEE THE TAMASHA AS SOON AS THESE TWO APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE MERCHANT'S WINDOW THEY WERE RECOGNISED
TAKING THE HORSES AND BAGS OF MUHRS WENT TO A GRAVEYARD ABOUT A MILE OR SO DISTANT IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE VIZIER'S SON
AND THE SERVANTS CAME RUNNING UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER IT HAPPENED THAT THE WOMAN HAD FAINTED AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY A VERY SLIGHT WOUND IN HER BREAST WHERE THE ARROW HAD GRAZED
WENT OUT TWO AND TWO AND WALKED ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT RAN THROUGH THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ROBBING THOSE TRAVELLERS WHO COULD NOT RESIST THEM AND INVITING OTHERS WHO WERE TOO POWERFUL FOR TWO OF THEM
QUICKLY MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND SHE AGREED TO LET THEM STAY THERE FOR A FEW DAYS AS SOON AS HER WORK WAS OVER THE OLD WOMAN CAME AND SAT DOWN WITH HER LODGERS
BECAUSE HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME AND COUNTRY AND RISKED HIS LIFE FOR HIM AND MOREOVER IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS FRIEND'S HELP HE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET WITH HER
BURN ON HER BACK GO AND IF IT IS AS I SAY SEND THE PRINCESS TO ME AND I WILL PUNISH HER
OF COURSE THERE IS AND A QUEEN AND A PRINCESS WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES
AND BE KEPT NEAR THE GRAVE WHENCE SHE TOOK OUT THE CORPSE SAID THE FAKIR THIS WAS DONE AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE AND THE PRINCESS
ONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY APPEARS VERY STUPID HE ASKED ME THE NAME OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE NAME OF THE KING NOW WHERE CAN THESE MEN HAVE COME FROM THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THESE THINGS HOWEVER
AND THE BEST PROVISIONS SET BEFORE HIM AH THOUGHT HE AS HE LAY DOWN TO REST
FIFTY THOUSAND RUPEES THE PRINCE REPLIED ALL RIGHT SAID THE MAN WAIT HERE WHILE I GO AND FETCH THE MONEY THE PRINCE WAITED AND WAITED
HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A JOGI
WHEN THEY REACHED THE LAST CUSTOM HOUSE THE VIZIER'S SON OVERTOOK THEM HE HAD COME WITH ALL HASTE BRINGING WITH HIM FOUR BAGS OF MUHRS ON FOUR HORSES I AM COME HE SAID
ABOUT US IN THE HEARING OF THE PRINCESS
AND HIS MAGNIFICENT RETINUE HE WAS AT ONCE RECONCILED AND ORDERED HIM TO ENTER THE CITY AND TAKE UP HIS ABODE THERE HENCEFORTH ALL WAS SUNSHINE ON THE PATH OF THE PRINCE
THERE WAS HARDLY TEN RUPEES WORTH LEFT IN THE PLACE THE FAITHFUL DOG HOWEVER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WENT AND FOLLOWED THE THIEVES AND SAW WHERE THEY DEPOSITED THE THINGS AND THEN RETURNED
WHOM HE SUPPOSED WAS THE ROBBERS HOUSEKEEPER SHE HAD AGREED TO RELEASE THEM ON THE PROMISE OF HER MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCE
REMEMBERED HIM ACCORDINGLY HE SENT BACK HIS SALAM AND EXPRESSIONS OF THANKFULNESS WHEN IT WAS DINNER TIME HE TOOK THE SAUCEPAN OF PILAW
THE KING WAS MORE ANGRY THAN BEFORE AND BANISHED HIS SON FROM THE COUNTRY SO THE PRINCE BADE ADIEU TO HIS MOTHER AND RELATIONS AND FRIENDS
NEVER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUDDENLY ESTRANGE YOU FROM ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO
CARE YOU NOT WHETHER THEY CURSE ME AND I DIE GO BACK IMMEDIATELY AND AWAIT MY RETURN
THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WERE OFF AGAIN
EVER BEEN BEFORE HENCEFORTH THE PRINCE VISITED
WITH THEIR VALUABLE BURDENS ON REACHING A PLACE ON THE BORDERS OF THE KING'S DOMINIONS THE PRINCE GAVE THE SOLDIERS SOME GOLD AND ORDERED THEM TO RETURN THE SOLDIERS TOOK THE MONEY AND LEFT
LEST YOU DO THAT WHICH AFTERWARDS YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR LIFE NOT TO HAVE DONE BY THE TIME THE PRINCE HAD CONCLUDED THIS STORY IT WAS NEARLY MORNING AND HE WENT AWAY AFTER REWARDING THE MAN THE PRINCE THEN VISITED THE COUNTRY BELONGING TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A WEALTHY MERCHANT WHO HAD A PET DOG HE WAS SUDDENLY REDUCED TO POVERTY AND HAD TO PART WITH HIS DOG HE GOT A LOAN OF FIVE THOUSAND RUPEES FROM A BROTHER MERCHANT
THE SOURCE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LAKE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS COVERED WITH THE MAGNIFICENT LOTUS FLOWER AND OTHER WATER PLANTS THE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON THE BANK AND BEING THIRSTY
OH SHE CRIED I THOUGHT THAT BOTH OF YOU WOULD BE KILLED BY THIS TIME THE ROYAL ELEPHANTS HAVE GOT LOOSE AND ARE RUNNING ABOUT WILDLY WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU
WHENCE HE HAD COME WHY HE HAD COME AND WHAT WAS HIS CASTE TO WHICH HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BRAHMAN AND WAS WANDERING HITHER AND THITHER BEGGING A LIVELIHOOD FOR HIMSELF AND WIFE AND PARENTS
HE LOOKED AROUND AS BEFORE AND THIS TIME DISCOVERED A FAIRY SITTING BY THE BANK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LAKE ON SEEING HER HE FELL SO MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER THAT HE DROPPED DOWN IN A SWOON
SHE FELT A SMARTING PAIN IN HER BACK AND NOTICED THAT HER PEARL NECKLACE WAS GONE SHE WENT AT ONCE AND INFORMED THE KING OF THE LOSS OF HER NECKLACE BUT SAID NOTHING TO HIM ABOUT THE PAIN IN HER BACK
AND PROMISED THAT THEY EACH WOULD GIVE HIM A DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE HE AGREED TO DO SO AND SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THEIR PARDON THEN THE PRINCE
ALL THE NIGHT AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE SAW TWO SHAHMARS COME OUT FROM THE NOSTRILS OF THE PRINCESS THEY STOLE OVER TOWARDS HIM INTENDING TO KILL HIM LIKE THE OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM
NIGHT HAD NOT LONG CAST ITS DARK MANTLE OVER THE SCENE WHEN THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE THREW OFF THEIR DISGUISE AND TAKING THEIR HORSES AND LUGGAGE APPEARED BEFORE THE CAGE THEY RELEASED THE PRINCESS
I SUPPOSE THE ARROW STRUCK THE MERCHANT'S WIFE HAD I KNOWN THAT SHE OR ANYBODY HAD BEEN NEAR
WE WILL SPEAK OF THIS LATER ON SAID THE KING ON HEARING THIS ANSWER DISMISS THE PEOPLE THEIR PRESENCE IS NO LONGER NEEDED IN THE EVENING
AS SOON AS THE WOMAN RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE TOLD THEM THAT TWO YOUNG MEN HAD PASSED BY THE PLACE WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD MOST DELIBERATELY AIMED AT HER
AND THE WOMAN LEFT ON THIS SCRAP OF PAPER WERE WRITTEN THREE PIECES OF ADVICE FIRST IF A PERSON IS TRAVELLING AND REACHES ANY STRANGE PLACE AT NIGHT LET HIM BE CAREFUL WHERE HE PUTS UP
HE MOST HUMBLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY AT HIS PALACE AND TO ACCEPT WHAT LITTLE HOSPITALITY COULD BE PROVIDED WHILE THE PRINCE WAS STAYING AT THE PALACE HE SAW HIS SISTER WHO GREETED HIM WITH SMILES AND KISSES ON LEAVING
HIS MAJESTY WAS VERY GLAD THEREFORE WHEN HE SAW THE BRAHMAN AND HEARD THAT HE WAS GOOD AND HONEST HE AT ONCE DEPUTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF THIS TEMPLE AND ORDERED FIFTY KHARWARS OF RICE
PRETENDED TO BE ABSORBED IN WORSHIP NEWS OF THE MAN AND OF HIS WONDERFUL PIETY REACHED THE EARS OF THE KING HE FELT INTERESTED IN HIM AS HIS WIFE WAS VERY ILL AND HE HAD SOUGHT FOR HAKIMS
LEAVING THE DOG AS A PLEDGE AND WITH THE MONEY BEGAN BUSINESS AGAIN
TO MANAGE TO COME AND REST AT THEIR HOUSE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY ATTACKED THEM AND STOLE THEIR GOODS THESE THIEVES LIVED IN A KIND OF TOWER WHICH HAD SEVERAL STRONG ROOMS IN IT AND UNDER IT
THE PRINCE SHOULD BE BANISHED FROM THE COUNTRY THIS WAS FINALLY AGREED TO ACCORDINGLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A LITTLE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ESCORTED THE PRINCE OUT OF THE CITY
FAIRY HE LOOKED ROUND HOPING TO SEE THE REALITY BUT SEEING NO PERSON HE DRANK THE WATER AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE SOME MORE AGAIN HE SAW THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER WHICH WAS IN HIS PALM
THEY ARE VERY GREAT AND VERY RICH
MY BROTHER WHAT IS THIS OH DO NOT DIE AND LEAVE ME THUS SPEAK SPEAK I CANNOT BEAR THIS IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE REVIVED BY THE WATER
AND ORDERED HER TO MANAGE SOMEHOW OR OTHER FOR THE OLD PEOPLE DURING THE FEW MONTHS THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT HE BEGGED HER TO BE INDUSTRIOUS LEST HIS PARENTS SHOULD BE ANGRY AND CURSE HIM ONE MORNING HE STARTED WITH SOME FOOD IN A BUNDLE
WERE DEPENDENT ON THEIR SON FOR THEIR SUBSISTENCE EVERY DAY THE YOUNG FELLOW USED TO GO OUT AND GET WHAT HE COULD BY BEGGING THIS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME
YOU DETEST THE SIGHT OF ME I HAVE LOOKED UPON A FAIRY THE PRINCE SAID BUT A MOMENT I SAW HER FACE FOR WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH LOTUS PETALS
CHAFFING HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MISSED THE BIRD PRESENTLY THE MERCHANT WENT TO ASK HIS WIFE ABOUT SOMETHING AND FOUND HER LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE
RUBBED SOME OINTMENT OVER THE SCARS ON HER BACK AND THEN SAT HER UPON ONE OF THEIR HORSES BEHIND THE PRINCE AWAY THEY RODE FAST AND FAR AND BY THE MORNING
KASABAH AND PUTS WHO IS COMING
WHY YOU ARE CRYING TELL HER THAT YOU WEEP FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR FRIEND WHO DIED SUDDENLY THIS MORNING LOOK TAKE TOO THIS WINE AND THIS SHOVEL AND WHEN YOU HAVE FEIGNED INTENSE GRIEF AT THE DEATH OF YOUR FRIEND
AND DEPRESSED THE PRINCE NOTICED THIS CHANGE IN HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE REASON IS IT BECAUSE I AM AWAY SO MUCH AT THE PALACE
THE MERCHANT ADVISED HIM TO VISIT THE KIND AND GENEROUS KING OF THAT COUNTRY AND OFFERED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE COURT NOW AT THAT TIME IT HAPPENED THAT THE KING WAS SEEKING FOR A BRAHMAN
THE PRINCESS WEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS HER GREATEST HELPER AND FRIEND A LETTER WAS SENT TO THE CHIEF VIZIER TELLING HIM OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PRINCE
STEP INTO IT AND DESIRE TO BE AT HOME THE OLD WOMAN DID SO AND WAS AT ONCE CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR QUICKLY AND SAFELY TO HER HUT WHERE SHE FOUND HER TWO LODGERS SAFE AND SOUND
RETURNED AND FOUND THE FIRE LIGHTED THE HORSES SECURELY FASTENED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS CONVERSATION SHE ORDERED ONE OF HER MAIDS TO MAKE A PILAW
THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING TRICKS WITH YOU YOU WILL SOON HAVE YOUR HEART'S DESIRE
THEY DID NOT HOWEVER GO VERY FAR BUT HID THEMSELVES BEHIND ROCKS AND STONES AND WAITED TILL THEY WERE QUITE SURE THAT THE PRINCE DID NOT INTEND TO COME BACK ON AND ON THE EXILES WALKED
BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER BROTHER GO AWAY REPLIED THE PRINCE
AND SWORE THAT MOST TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE VISITED ON THE OFFENDER IF HE COULD BE DISCOVERED HE ORDERED THE MERCHANT TO GO BACK AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER HIS WIFE COULD RECOGNISE THE YOUNG MEN
AND THEN HANDING IT TO HER AND GIVE IT TO THE KING YOU WILL SEE THAT HE WILL GIVE YOU A LAC OF RUPEES FOR IT
OF THESE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS AS HE WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF IN THE FAVOUR OF THE PRINCE
NOBODY THE OLD WOMAN REPLIED
CONSEQUENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND ORDERED THE JOGI TO BE EXECUTED THIS STERN ORDER HOWEVER WAS NOT CARRIED OUT AS THE PRINCE BRIBED THE MEN AND ESCAPED FROM THE COUNTRY BUT HE KNEW THAT THE SECOND BIT OF ADVICE WAS TRUE
STAYING IN HER HOUSE BUT THE SIGHT OF A MUHR WHICH THE PRINCE DROPPED IN THE BOTTOM OF A CUP IN WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN HIM WATER AND A PRESENT OF ANOTHER MUHR
THE GIRL PRETENDED TO BE VERY ANGRY WHY HAVE YOU NOT BEEN FOR TWO DAYS SHE ASKED BECAUSE MY DEAR THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED TWO YOUNG TRAVELLERS
PROVIDED SHE COULD MAKE HER PASS FOR A BOY AND HER SON'S CHILD BUT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPOSE UPON AN OLD EXPERIENCED MOTHER SHE HOWEVER PRESENTED MARY IN THE CHARACTER OF HER GRANDSON THE OLD WOMAN PROPOSED TO TAKE THE BOY TO LIVE WITH HER
AND TO GO EVERY MAN ON BOARD THE NEW PRIZE WHEN HIS MEN WERE ON BOARD HER
THAT SHE TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF ENJOYING HIS COMPANY AND CONVERSATION AND AFTER SHE HAD GAINED HIS FRIENDSHIP DISCOVERED HER SEX
TOOK FROM HER HER ARMAMENT CONSISTING OF ONE LONG BRASS EIGHTEEN POUNDER ONE LONG BRASS SIX POUNDER
SHE SET HER STUDDING SAILS AND CROWDED EVERY INCH OF CANVASS IN CHASE
HE SOON CAME UP WITH THE ENEMY AND SHOWED HIS BLACK COLORS WITH NO SMALL SURPRISE AT HIS INSOLENCE IN COMING SO NEAR THEM THEY COMMANDED HIM TO STRIKE HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS DISPOSED TO GIVE THEM EMPLOYMENT UNTIL HIS COMPANION CAME UP WHO WAS ABLE TO CONTEND WITH THEM
THIS VESSEL WAS CAPTURED BY THE PIRATE ENGLAND UPON THE GUINEA COAST WHOSE COMPANIONS PLUNDERED THE CREW AND MURDERED THE CAPTAIN AS IS RELATED IN ENGLAND'S LIFE UPON THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN SKINNER
AFTER COMING TO ANCHOR A SUMMONS WAS SENT FOR HIM TO SURRENDER WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY A BRISK CANNONADE FROM HIS BREASTWORK THE VESSELS WERE WARPED CLOSE IN SHORE AND THE BOATS MANNED AND SENT ON SHORE WHILST THE VESSELS OPENED UPON THE PIRATES
THIS GENTLEMAN AND HIS WHOLE SHIP'S COMPANY HAD BEEN CUT OFF AT THE INSTIGATION OF ORT VANTYLE A DUTCHMAN OF NEW YORK OUT OF HER THEY TOOK WATER CASKS AND OTHER NECESSARIES WHICH HAVING DONE THEY DESIGNED FOR THE RIVER METHELAGE

AT NINE O'CLOCK A M THE CHASE FIRED UPON THE CAROLINA WHICH WAS RETURNED EACH VESSEL CONTINUED FIRING DURING THE CHASE WHEN THEIR LONG GUNS COULD REACH
BUT FROM THE WANT OF THEIR USUAL SUPPLIES THEIR MONEY BECAME EXHAUSTED AND BEING INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN ROGERS IN THE ISLAND OF PROVIDENCE WAS FITTING OUT SOME VESSELS FOR PRIVATEERING MARY WITH SOME OTHERS REPAIRED TO THAT ISLAND

A GRAPE SHOT BROKE THE BONE OF HIS RIGHT LEG AND HE RECEIVED A CUT IN THE ABDOMEN BUT HIS CREW FOUGHT LIKE TIGERS AND THE DECK WAS ANKLE DEEP WITH BLOOD AND GORE THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOARDERS RECEIVED SUCH A TREMENDOUS BLOW ON THE HEAD FROM THE BUTT END OF A MUSKET
WHICH HAS FROM NINE TO TEN FEET OF WATER WITHIN THIS PASS ABOUT TWO LEAGUES FROM THE OPEN SEA LIES THE ONLY SECURE HARBOR ON THE COAST AND ACCORDINGLY THIS WAS THE HARBOR FREQUENTED BY THE PIRATES SO WELL KNOWN BY THE NAME OF BARRATARIANS
AND SHE FELL PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH HIM THE VIOLENCE OF HER FEELINGS RENDERED HER NEGLIGENT OF HER DUTY AND EFFECTED SUCH A CHANGE IN HER BEHAVIOUR AS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF ALL BOTH HER COMRADE AND THE REST OF THE REGIMENT DEEMED HER MAD
BUT THE MOTHER WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PART WITH HER BOY THE GRANDMOTHER THEREFORE ALLOWED A CROWN PER WEEK FOR HIS SUPPORT THE INGENUITY OF THE MOTHER BEING SUCCESSFUL SHE REARED THE DAUGHTER AS A BOY BUT AS SHE GREW UP

THAT THEY REMAINED IN THE ISLAND AND ONE OF THEM MARRIED AND SETTLED THERE DAVIS NOW SAILED FOR BONAVISTA AND PERCEIVING NOTHING IN THAT HARBOR STEERED FOR THE ISLE OF MAY
HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE PIRATES WHO FREQUENTED THAT PLACE HAD JUST ACCEPTED OF HIS MAJESTY'S PARDON AND HAD SURRENDERED

AND TWO OR THREE MEN WOUNDED IN TAKING THIS SHIP THEY DAMAGED THEIR OWN SO MUCH BY SPRINGING THEIR FOREMAST CARRYING AWAY THEIR BOWSPRIT AND BEATING IN PART OF THEIR UPPER WORKS THAT THEY DID NOT THINK HER LONGER FIT FOR THEIR USE

AGAIN THE REEKING STEEL WAS UPHELD AND LAFITTE PLACED HIS LEFT HAND NEAR THE CAPTAIN'S HEART TO MAKE HIS AIM MORE SURE
YOU WILL PLEASE TO SEND AN OFFICER WITH SUCH DEMANDS WHOM YOU MAY BE ASSURED WILL BE TREATED WITH THE GREATEST POLITENESS AND RECEIVE EVERY SATISFACTION REQUIRED BUT IF YOU ARE ORDERED OR SHOULD ATTEMPT TO ENTER THIS PORT IN A HOSTILE MANNER
AND IT WAS RESOLVED TO REPAIR TO COXON'S HOLE AT THE EAST END OF THE ISLAND OF CUBA WHERE THEY COULD REMAIN IN PERFECT SECURITY AS THE ENTRANCE WAS SO NARROW THAT ONE SHIP COULD KEEP OUT A HUNDRED
ON WHICH MAY DEPEND THE SAFETY OF THIS COUNTRY I OFFER TO YOU TO RESTORE TO THIS STATE SEVERAL CITIZENS WHO PERHAPS IN YOUR EYES HAVE LOST THAT SACRED TITLE I OFFER YOU THEM HOWEVER SUCH AS YOU COULD WISH TO FIND THEM
THAN CALLING A FEW OF HIS BEST MEN BY HIS SIDE HE SPRUNG FORWARD TO THE POINT OF DANGER AND CLEARING THE BREASTWORK OF THE ENTRENCHMENTS LEAPED CUTLASS IN HAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY FOLLOWED BY A SCORE OF HIS MEN WHO IN MANY A HARD FOUGHT BATTLE UPON HIS OWN DECK
THEY FOUND NOTHING ON BOARD BUT BALE GOODS MOST OF WHICH THEY THREW OVERBOARD IN SEARCH OF GOLD
ABOUT THIS TIME ONE MITCHELL WHO HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO LAFITTE'S GANG COLLECTED UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DESPERADOES AND FORTIFIED HIMSELF ON AN ISLAND NEAR BARRATARIA WITH SEVERAL PIECES OF CANNON
AFTER HE HAD SERVED SOME YEARS ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR HE WENT TO BARBADOES WHERE HE MARRIED GOT INTO THE MERCHANT SERVICE AND DESIGNED TO SETTLE IN THE ISLAND
I DECLARE TO YOU THAT I WILL INSTANTLY LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO AVOID THE IMPUTATION OF HAVING COOPERATED TOWARDS AN INVASION ON THIS POINT WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO TAKE PLACE AND TO REST SECURE IN THE ACQUITTAL OF MY CONSCIENCE
THAT WHEN THE VESSEL WAS TAKEN THESE TWO HEROINES ALONG WITH ANOTHER OF THE PIRATES WERE THE LAST THREE UPON DECK AND THAT MARY HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO ROUSE THE COURAGE OF THE CREW WHO HAD FLED BELOW DISCHARGED A PISTOL AMONGST THEM
AFTER A VERY SUCCESSFUL CRUISE
COMPREHENDED BETWEEN BASTIEN BAY ON THE EAST AND THE MOUTHS OF THE RIVER OR BAYOU LA FOURCHE ON THE WEST NOT FAR FROM THE SEA ARE LAKES CALLED THE GREAT AND LITTLE LAKES OF BARRATARIA COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER BY SEVERAL LARGE BAYOUS WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF BRANCHES
AND SWORE THAT HE AND ALL HIS COMRADES WOULD PERISH WITHIN THEIR TRENCHES BEFORE THEY WOULD SURRENDER TO ANY MAN FOUR OF THIS GANG HAVING GONE TO NEW ORLEANS ON A FROLIC INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO THE CITY WATCH AND THE HOUSE SURROUNDED
THE BOAT'S CREWS LANDED UNDER A GALLING FIRE OF GRAPE SHOT AND FORMED IN THE MOST UNDAUNTED MANNER AND ALTHOUGH A SEVERE LOSS WAS SUSTAINED THEY ENTERED THE BREASTWORK AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET AFTER A DESPERATE FIGHT
THE SINGULARITY OF TWO TROOPERS MARRYING CAUSED A GENERAL CONVERSATION AND MANY OF THE OFFICERS HONORED THE CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE AND RESOLVED TO MAKE PRESENTS TO THE BRIDE TO PROVIDE HER WITH NECESSARIES AFTER MARRIAGE THEY WERE DESIROUS TO QUIT THE SERVICE
WHERE HE FELL ILL AND DIED WITH GRIEF THE PIRATES HAVING HERE VICTUALLED THEY SAILED FOR THE BAY OF SAINT AUGUSTINE WHERE THEY TOOK IN BETWEEN SEVENTY AND EIGHTY MEN WHO HAD BELONGED TO THE SHIP ALEXANDER COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN JAMES A PIRATE THEY ALSO TOOK UP HER GUNS
WHEN TWO PRIVATEERS BEING AT ANCHOR OFF CAT ISLAND A BRITISH SLOOP OF WAR ANCHORED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PASS AND SENT HER BOATS TO ENDEAVOR TO TAKE THE PRIVATEERS BUT THEY WERE REPULSED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS
THE UPPER DECK WAS CLEARED AND THE BOARDERS RUSHED BELOW ON THE MAIN DECK TO COMPLETE THEIR CONQUEST HERE THE SLAUGHTER WAS DREADFUL TILL THE PIRATES CALLED OUT FOR QUARTER AND THE CARNAGE CEASED
THE ELECTION WAS SOON OVER AND A LARGE MAJORITY OF LEGAL VOTES WERE IN FAVOR OF DAVIS AND NO SCRUTINY DEMANDED DAVIS WAS DECLARED DULY ELECTED HE THEN DREW UP A CODE OF LAWS TO WHICH HE HIMSELF SWORE
FORMERLY A LIEUTENANT OF A MAN OF WAR BUT IN THE MERCHANT SERVICE WHEN HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE PIRATES CAPTAIN BOWEN AND SOME OTHER PRISONERS GOT INTO THE LONG BOAT AND WITH BROKEN OARS AND BARREL STAVES WHICH THEY FOUND IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT PADDLED TO AUGUSTIN BAY
AND NOTHING WAS SPARED TO ENTERTAIN AND RENDER HIM AND HIS MEN HAPPY HAVING AMUSED THEMSELVES DURING A WEEK THEY RETURNED TO THE SHIP AND ALLOWED THE OTHER HALF OF THE CREW TO VISIT THE CAPITAL AND ENJOY THEMSELVES IN LIKE MANNER
TO SERVE ON BOARD HIS PRIVATEERS WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT SCARCELY HAD THE SHIPS SAILED WHEN SOME OF THEIR CREWS MUTINIED AND RAN OFF WITH THE SHIPS TO PURSUE THEIR FORMER MODE OF LIFE AMONG THESE WAS MARY READ SHE INDEED FREQUENTLY DECLARED
FOR THE TIDE OF FLOOD FETCHED HER OFF THE CAPTAIN OF THE SPEAKER FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE SHIP WHICH FRIGHTENED THE PIRATES
THERE IS ALSO THE ISLAND OF BARRATARIA AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH IS A PLACE CALLED THE TEMPLE WHICH DENOMINATION IT OWES TO SEVERAL MOUNDS OF SHELLS THROWN UP THERE BY THE INDIANS THE NAME OF BARRATARIA IS ALSO GIVEN TO A LARGE BASIN
INCREASED WITH HER YEARS AND LEAVING THAT SERVILE EMPLOYMENT SHE ENGAGED ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR THE VOLATILE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUTH DID NOT PERMIT HER TO REMAIN LONG IN THIS STATION AND SHE NEXT WENT INTO FLANDERS AND JOINED A REGIMENT OF FOOT AS A CADET
HIS SHIP APPEARED AGAIN ON THE COAST WITH TWO OTHERS AND CONTINUED STANDING OFF AND ON BEFORE THE PASS FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT HE PRETENDED NOT TO PERCEIVE THE RETURN OF THE SLOOP OF WAR WHO TIRED OF WAITING TO NO PURPOSE PUT OUT TO SEA AND DISAPPEARED
THEIR ZEAL THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR SKILL WERE REMARKED BY THE WHOLE ARMY WHO COULD NO LONGER CONSIDER SUCH BRAVE MEN AS CRIMINALS IN A FEW DAYS PEACE WAS DECLARED BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES
THAT OF GOING ON BOARD THE PIRATE VESSEL WHICH WAS COMMANDED BY ONE WILLIAM READ WHO RECEIVED THEM VERY CIVILLY
DURING THREE DAYS THESE THREE VESSELS SAILED IN COMPANY BUT FINDING THAT HIS LATE PRIZE WAS A HEAVY SAILER HE EMPTIED HER OF EVERYTHING THAT HE STOOD IN NEED OF AND THEN RESTORED HER TO THE CAPTAIN WITH ALL HIS MEN
THE ATTENTION OF OUR READERS IS NOW TO BE DIRECTED TO THE HISTORY OF TWO FEMALE PIRATES A HISTORY WHICH IS CHIEFLY REMARKABLE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE SOFTER SEX ASSUMING A CHARACTER PECULIARLY DISTINGUISHED FOR EVERY VICE THAT CAN DISGRACE HUMANITY
MOUNTING TWENTY GUNS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND SAILED FOR GAUDALOUPE AMONGST THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS HE MADE SEVERAL VALUABLE PRIZES BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE ON A CRUISE THE ISLAND HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY THE BRITISH
THE PIRATICAL ESTABLISHMENT OF BARRATARIA HAVING BEEN BROKEN UP AND LAFITTE NOT BEING CONTENT WITH LEADING AN HONEST PEACEFUL LIFE PROCURED SOME FAST SAILING VESSELS AND WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS PROCEEDED TO GALVEZTON BAY IN TEXAS
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE GUARD AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE THEY WERE ALL CUT OFF AND AT THE SAME TIME
EXCEPT THE OFFICERS BEING ON BOARD ON A VOTE THEY GAVE CAPTAIN PENRUDDOCK FROM WHOM THEY TOOK A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF MONEY THE PORTUGUESE SHIP AND CARGO WITH WHAT BALE HE PLEASED TO TAKE OUT OF HIS OWN BID HIM GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MAKE WHAT HE COULD OF HER
FOR THEY WERE IN THE BOAT THAT MOST OF THE MEN GOT INTO HER THE QUARTER MASTER RAN DOWN SWORD IN HAND AND THOUGH HE WAS ATTACKED BY MANY HE BEHAVED HIMSELF SO WELL THAT HE GOT INTO A LITTLE CANOE PUT OFF AND REACHED THE LONG BOAT IN THE INTERIM THE LITTLE FORT THE ARABIANS HAD PLAYED UPON THE SHIP
TO THE BENEFIT OF A FULL PARDON AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION AS WELL AS IN CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CASE I JAMES MADISON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DO ISSUE THIS PROCLAMATION
IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN AND CHIEF MATE WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL OTHERS WOUNDED THOSE WHO WERE ASHORE WITH CAPTAIN WHITE RESOLVING TO ENTER IN THIS SHIP DETERMINED HIM TO GO ALSO RATHER THAN BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE NATIVES HOPING BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RETURNING HOME
IN WHICH HE MADE TWO SUCCESSFUL VOYAGES TO GUINEA AND BACK TO BARBADOES IN HIS THIRD HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE TAKEN BY A FRENCH PIRATE AS WERE SEVERAL OTHER ENGLISH SHIPS THE MASTERS AND INFERIOR OFFICERS OF WHICH THEY DETAINED BEING IN WANT OF GOOD ARTISTS
WHO HAD BEEN BRED A LIGHTERMAN ON THE RIVER THAMES CAME IN THIS SHIP WAS TAKEN AT AUGUSTIN BY SOME PIRATES FROM SHORE AND THE CREW OF THEIR LONG BOAT WHICH JOINED THEM AT THE INSTIGATION OF ONE RANTEN BOATSWAIN'S MATE WHO SENT FOR WATER THEY CAME ON BOARD IN THE NIGHT AND SURPRISED HER THOUGH NOT WITHOUT RESISTANCE
BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN REPRESENTED THAT THE OFFENDERS HAVE MANIFESTED A SINCERE PENITENCE THAT THEY HAVE ABANDONED THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORST CAUSE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE BEST AND PARTICULARLY THAT THEY HAVE EXHIBITED IN THE DEFENCE OF NEW ORLEANS
GENERAL JACKSON IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE SECRETARY OF WAR DID NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE CONDUCT OF THE CORSAIRS OF BARRATARIA WHO WERE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN EMPLOYED IN THE ARTILLERY SERVICE
SHALL PRODUCE A CERTIFICATE IN WRITING FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA STATING THAT SUCH PERSON HAS AIDED IN THE DEFENCE OF NEW ORLEANS AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY DURING THE INVASION THEREOF AS AFORESAID
THEY GAINED THE REDOUBT THROUGH THE EMBRASURES LEAPING OVER THE PARAPET AND OVERWHELMING BY THEIR SUPERIOR FORCE THE SMALL PARTY STATIONED THERE LAFITTE WHO WAS COMMANDING IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS OFFICERS AT ONE OF THE GUNS NO SOONER SAW THE BOLD MOVEMENT OF THE ENEMY
AT GRAND JERRE THE PRIVATEERS PUBLICLY MADE SALE BY AUCTION OF THE CARGOES OF THEIR PRIZES FROM ALL PARTS OF LOWER LOUISIANA PEOPLE RESORTED TO BARRATARIA WITHOUT BEING AT ALL SOLICITOUS TO CONCEAL THE OBJECT OF THEIR JOURNEY
PRINCIPALLY SPECIE SHE WAS THE FIRST VESSEL THAT SAILED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF TEXAS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WELL KNOWING THAT WHERE LAFITTE WAS PIRACY AND SMUGGLING WOULD BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY
WITH THIS VIEW HE REPRESENTED TO THE LATTER THAT BESIDES THE INFAMY THAT WOULD ATTACH TO THEM IF THEY TREATED AS PRISONERS PEOPLE WHO HAD COME WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE THEY WOULD LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOVERING THE PROJECTS OF THE BRITISH AGAINST LOUISIANA
AT THE SAME TIME HE GAVE THEM A WRITTEN PAPER WITH THEIR PROPER INSTRUCTIONS
YOU MAY COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY SENDING A BOAT TO THE EASTERN POINT OF THE PASS WHERE I WILL BE FOUND YOU HAVE INSPIRED ME WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN THE ADMIRAL YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER COULD HAVE DONE HIMSELF WITH YOU ALONE I WISH TO DEAL
TO CONFORM TO THE LAW TO RETIRE AND WITHDRAW WHILE THE CHORUS AGAIN WITH THE FORMAL SAW FIXT AND ASSIGN'D TO THE FESTIVE DAY MOVE TO THE MEASURE AND MARCH AWAY SEMI CHORUS
SO THE CHARMS OF CONVERSATION FASCINATED US WHILE WAKEFULNESS STILL PREVAILED AMONG US UNTIL THE MOON HAD AT LENGTH DISAPPEARED IN THE WEST BUT WHEN THE GLOOM OF NIGHT HAD THUS DRAWN ITS CURTAIN AND NOTHING BUT SLUMBER REMAINED ABROAD
AND THE AUDIBLE PRAYERS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN MINGLED WITH THE SOUND
MOCKING FLOUTING QUAFFING ONE AND ALL ALL HAVE HAD A BELLY FULL OF BREAKFAST BRAVE AND PLENTIFUL THEREFORE EVERMORE WITH YOUR VOICES AND YOUR BODIES SERVE THE GODDESS
THOUGH I NE'ER HAD EXPECTED MY FRAUD UNDETECTED OR DOUBTFUL MY MEANING TO MAKE
AND THE CAVALIER RAN BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID THAT IT MUST BE A FABLE MADE UP BY THOSE WHO WRITE BOOKS YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY MUST NOT BELIEVE WHAT IS WRITTEN IT IS FICTION AND SOMETHING THAT THEY CALL THE BLACK ART
FOR MANY A HEART WI THIS WE BRAKE AND HARRIED MANY A SPRITE
WE HEARD FROM THE DOOR THE LOW CALL OF A BENIGHTED TRAVELER AND THEN FOLLOWED THE KNOCK OF ONE SEEKING ADMISSION AND WE ANSWERED
AFFIRMS WITHOUT HESITATION THAT I AM SURELY A FRENCHMAN THE OFFICER BEGINS TO BE IMPATIENT HAVE DONE WITH THESE TRIALS THEY PROVE NOTHING
AND TOOK HER STAND AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR THE MASS BEGAN AND AT THE TINKLING OF THE BELL ALL FELL UPON THEIR FACES AND NOT A SOUND WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD HAD NOT A FLIGHT OF PIGEONS PASSED DIRECTLY OVER THE ALTAR
SINCE THE ROOFED HALL PREVENTED BRIGHTNESS A GLEAMING FIRE LIGHT HE SAW FLASHING RESPLENDENT THE GOOD ONE SAW THEN THE SEA BOTTOM'S MONSTER THE MIGHTY MERE WOMAN
FROM THE FROGS FRERE'S TRANSLATION CHORUS SHOUTING AND SINGING IACCHUS IACCHUS HO IACCHUS IACCHUS HO XANTHIAS
AND CLAD HER IN YOUTH'S CLOTHING WHEREUPON SHE CAME FORWARD SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND COQUETTISHLY MOVING AND INDEED SHE RAVISHED WITS
WHEN THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT HEARD THIS THEY KISSED GROUND BEFORE HIM AND BLESSED HIM
UNPARALL'D SIGHT WHICH SHOWED MY EYES A SUMMER MOON UPON A WINTER NIGHT THEN THEY RETURNED TO SHAHRAZAD AND DISPLAYED HER
THOSE ARE FROGS SAID THE LITTLE KITCHEN MAID BUT NOW I THINK WE SHALL SOON HEAR IT
IN A SPLENDIDLY ADORNED SHIP HE HAD COME TO THEM MYSTERIOUSLY ALONE IN A SHIP WHEN AN INFANT AT THE HOUR THAT WAS FATED
CAUGHT OUT AGAIN BY THE SMELLING SALTS
IN A SPORTIVE MANNER DARTED THEIR AMOROUS GLANCES AT THE COURTIERS THE MORE TO ENCOURAGE THEM OTHERS SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN OTHER DIVERSIONS SUCH AS SHOOTING WITH BOWS AND ARROWS TOSSING THE PIKE CASTING OF HEAVY STONES AND ROCKS
NO ONE WAS THERE TO WIND HIM UP AND HE COULD NOT SING WITHOUT THAT BUT DEATH KEPT ON STARING AT THE EMPEROR WITH HIS GREAT HOLLOW EYES AND IT WAS QUIET FEARFULLY QUIET THEN THERE SOUNDED
UNLESS HIS CLOTHES AND ARMS WERE MADE IN THE SAME FASHION AS THOSE OF ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS AT LENGTH THE FAME OF HIS MUNIFICENCE AND VALOR SPREADING OVER THE WHOLE WORLD HE BECAME A TERROR TO THE KINGS OF OTHER COUNTRIES
NEVER WHILST I LIVE SHALL I CEASE TO BLAME MYSELF FOR THE PAST AS FOR THIS SHAHRAZAD HER LIKE IS NOT FOUND IN THE LANDS SO PRAISE BE TO HIM
WAS HERE EXHIBITED AT ITS BEST HE NEVER AGAIN SHOWED THE SAME FORCE OF CONCEPTION WHICH GOT HIS IMPERFECT LITERARY ART FORGIVEN
WELL I WAS ALWAYS HEARTY DISPOSED TO MIRTH AND EASE I'M READY TO JOIN THE PARTY
THE INTEREST NEVER FLAGS WHAT SEEMS THE ARBITRARY BREAKING OFF OF A STORY BEFORE ITS CLOSE IS REALLY THE ART OF THE POET FOR HE KNOWS WERE EACH EPISODE TO BE TOLD BY ITSELF WE SHOULD HAVE ONLY A STRING OF NOVELLE
WAS BRUITED ABROAD AND THE PEOPLE NAMED THEM THE MARVELS AND WONDERS OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT
AND THE ADJOINING FIELDS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH
BY HIM WHO HOSPITABLE RITES ORDAINED AND FIRST OF ALL AND BEST THOSE RITES MAINTAINED I SWEAR THAT FRIENDLY CONVERSE AND A HOME IS ALL WE HAVE FOR THOSE WHO NIGHTLY ROAM AND I REPLIED
WITH DOUBLE MEANING DIGHT WE CALL THIS GARMENT
DUBRICIUS'S SPEECH AGAINST THE TREACHEROUS SAXONS OF WHOM ARTHUR SLAYS MANY IN BATTLE WHEN HE HAD DONE SPEAKING SAINT DUBRICIUS ARCHBISHOP OF LEGIONS GOING TO THE TOP OF A HILL CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE
SO SOON AS THE TOY BIRD WAS WOUND UP HE COULD SING ONE OF THE PIECES THAT THE REAL ONE SANG AND THEN HIS TAIL MOVED UP AND DOWN AND SHONE WITH SILVER AND GOLD ROUND HIS NECK HUNG A LITTLE RIBBON AND ON THAT WAS WRITTEN
SO TRANSPORTING WAS THE HARMONY OF THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND VOICES WHEREOF THERE WAS A VAST VARIETY IN BOTH CHURCHES THAT THE KNIGHTS WHO ATTENDED WERE IN DOUBT WHICH TO PREFER AND THEREFORE CROWDED FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER BY TURNS
IN WHICH ARE SEEN AS IN A MIRROR THE GAY LIFE THE INTELLECTUAL BRILLIANCY AND THE SENSUOUS LOVE FOR BEAUTY WHICH MARK THE AGE AT SEVENTEEN HE BEGAN THE STUDY OF THE LAW WHICH HE SOON ABANDONED FOR THE CHARMS OF LETTERS MOST OF HIS LIFE WAS PASSED IN THE SERVICE
A FEARFUL TEMPEST DROVE THEM TO THE HARBOR OF BOUGIE AN AFRICAN PORT A HUNDRED MILES EAST OF ALGIERS THENCE THEY MADE THE PERILOUS JOURNEY BY LAND TO THEIR PLACE OF STARTING
WHEREUPON SHE ANSWERED O KING OF THE AGE WE SEEK OF HIM ONE CONDITION TO WIT THAT HE TAKE UP HIS ABODE WITH US FOR THAT I CANNOT BROOK TO BE PARTED FROM MY SISTER AN HOUR
ERST HAD IT OFTEN ONSETS ENCOUNTERED OFT CLOVEN THE HELMET THE FATED ONE'S ARMOR TWAS THE FIRST TIME THAT EVER THE EXCELLENT JEWEL HAD FAILED OF ITS FAME FIRM MOODED AFTER
IT GUARDED HIS LIFE THE ENTRANCE DEFENDED GAINST SWORD POINT AND EDGES ECGTHEOW'S SON THERE HAD FATALLY JOURNEYED CHAMPION OF GEATMEN IN THE ARMS OF THE OCEAN HAD THE ARMOR NOT GIVEN
CONCLUSION OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT
THOSE ARE COWS MOOING SAID THE LITTLE KITCHEN GIRL WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THE PLACE YET NOW THE FROGS BEGAN TO CROAK IN THE MARSH GLORIOUS SAID THE CHINESE COURT PREACHER NOW I HEAR IT
AFTER THIRTY YEARS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX DER FORSTMEISTER THE HEAD FORESTER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND BRIGITTA EIGHTEEN EIGHTY
AND WHEN HE FRONTS HER FAVOR AND HER SMILE A MORN THE SUN OF DAY IN CLOUDS MUST DRESS THEN THEY DISPLAYED SHAHRAZAD IN THE THIRD DRESS
WITH THE ZEAL AND DEVOTION OF A SELF SACRIFICING PATRIOT ONCE WHEN HE PERCHED UPON THE END OF A PLANK FOR THE PURPOSE OF WEIGHING IT DOWN THE MOTION OF THE SAW SHOOK HIS EVERY LIMB
AND INCREASE THEE IN DIGNITY AND MAJESTY PRESENTLY ADDING
THREE AND THIRTY TIMES OVER DID IT SING THE SAME PIECE AND YET WAS NOT TIRED THE PEOPLE WOULD GLADLY HAVE HEARD IT AGAIN BUT THE EMPEROR SAID THAT THE LIVING NIGHTINGALE OUGHT TO SING A LITTLE SOMETHING BUT WHERE WAS IT
NOR A MAN OF AFFAIRS AND HIS LIFE AS AMBASSADOR OF CARDINAL IPPOLITO
ON THE DARK SOLEMNITY THERE THEY FLASH UPON THE SIGHT ALL THE PLAIN IS BLAZING BRIGHT FLUSHED AND OVERFLOWN WITH LIGHT AGE HAS CAST HIS YEARS AWAY
EVERY MOMENT HE NODDED HIS HEAD FOR IT PLEASED HIM TO HEAR THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT THE CITY THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT THE NIGHTINGALE IS THE BEST OF ALL IT STOOD WRITTEN THERE
FOR HAVING BEEN FLOUTED AND SCOFFED AND SCORNED ALL SUCH ARE ADMONISHED AND HEARTILY WARNED WE WARN THEM ONCE WE WARN THEM TWICE WE WARN AND ADMONISH WE WARN THEM THRICE
YES HE DECLARED THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THE REAL NIGHTINGALE NOT ONLY IN ITS FEATHERS AND ITS MANY BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS BUT INSIDE AS WELL FOR YOU SEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND ABOVE ALL YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
AND THE NIGHT FOLLOWING ENTERED WINCHESTER AS SOON AS QUEEN GUANHUMARA
LITTLE BAREFOOT JOSEPH IM SCHNEE JOSEPH IN THE SNOW EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND EDELWEISS EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE HIS WRITINGS OF THIS DATE
FROM HOCHDORF IT IS A LONG WAY TO STUTTGART AND FROM THERE IT IS A LONG WAY TO HEAVEN YET HOW LONG WELL YOU CAN'T GET THERE UNTIL YOU DIE
AS THE VESPER BELL RANG VALENTINE RELEASED THE HAND OF HIS SON WHO QUICKLY FOLDED HIS HANDS VALENTINE ALSO BROUGHT HIS HANDS TOGETHER OVER HIS HEAVY TOOLS AND SAID AN AVE
THEN THE TWO SOVRANS APPOINTED THEIR SIRE IN LAW THE WAZIR TO BE VICEROY IN SAMARCAND AND ASSIGNED HIM
AND RARE TRAITS AND ANECDOTES AND MORAL INSTANCES AND REMINISCENCES AND BADE THE FOLK COPY THEM AND DISPREAD THEM OVER ALL LANDS AND CLIMES WHEREFORE THEIR REPORT
TALES SKETCHES JOURNALISTIC POLITICAL AND DRAMATIC AND OTHER PAPERS REVEAL AUERBACH'S VARYING MOODS OR ENTHUSIASMS CHRONICLE HIS RESIDENCE IN DIFFERENT GERMAN OR AUSTRIAN CITIES
AND ON THIS WISE THEY CONTINUED TILL THERE TOOK THEM
AND IN THE SIXTH WHICH WAS GREEN WHEN SHE SURPASSED WITH HER LOVELINESS THE FAIR OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD
WHAT DO I CARE I'LL FIX HIM NEXT TIME
WERE EMPLOYED EITHER IN AN ASSAULT OR UPON THE DEFENSIVE THE HORSE WOULD COME IN AT FULL SPEED OBLIQUELY BREAK THROUGH THE ENEMY'S RANKS AND SO FORCE THEM TO FLEE NEVERTHELESS THIS PERJURED USURPER GOT HIS FORCES TOGETHER AGAIN
BACCHUS INDEED AND SO THEY ARE BUT WE'LL KEEP QUIET TILL WE MAKE THEM OUT A LITTLE MORE DISTINCTLY CHORUS SONG
O GLORIOUS VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF THE GODDESS WHAT A SCENT OF ROASTED GRISKIN REACHED MY SENSES
INTRODUCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A CANTO OR SCATTERED THROUGH THE BODY OF THE POEM THESE REFLECTIONS ARE FULL OF PRACTICAL SENSE AND WISDOM AND REMIND US OF THE FAMILIAR CONVERSATION WITH THE READER WHICH FORMS SO GREAT A CHARM IN THACKERAY'S NOVELS
AND SAGACITY WHEREBY WE MAY ATTAIN DISCRIMINATION THAT THOU WILT AID US BY THY GUIDANCE UNTO RIGHT CONCEPTIONS AND ENABLE US WITH THY HELP TO EXPRESS THEM WITH CLEARNESS AND THOU WILT GUARD US FROM ERROR IN NARRATION
WAS NOT AT ALL TO HIS LIKING
AND IN THANKSGIVING TO HIM AND THE PEOPLES AND THE PROVINCES WERE AT PEACE AND THE PREACHERS PRAYED FOR THEM FROM THE PULPITS AND THEIR REPORT WAS BRUITED ABROAD
CHRISTIAN THE TAILOR AND HIS WIFE CAME DOWN THE COVERED STAIRS OF THE CHURCH HILL IN SUPERIOR BLISS ORDINARILY THEY ATTRACTED LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE VILLAGE BUT ON THIS OCCASION ALL CROWDED AROUND THEM
AND A GREAT NUMBER OF MONKEYS
WHO WAS SO GRAND THAT IF ANY ONE LOWER IN RANK THAN HE DARED TO SPEAK TO HIM OR TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTION
I FEARED TO ANSWER FOR THE PASSPORTS STEEPED IN VINEGAR TO PREVENT INFECTION WERE IN THE OFFICER'S HANDS AND I HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN WHETHER I WAS FROM SCHWEKAT OR FROM LEOBEN
CLOSE BY THE WINDOW THE MOST LOVELY SONG IT WAS THE LITTLE LIVE NIGHTINGALE THAT SAT OUTSIDE ON A SPRAY IT HAD HEARD OF THE EMPEROR'S NEED AND HAD COME TO SING TO HIM OF TRUST AND HOPE
BEST TAKE IN SAIL THESE SMELLING SALTS METHINKS WILL BLOW A GALE
BUT IN THIS TOY BIRD EVERYTHING IS SETTLED IT IS JUST SO AND NOT ANY OTHER WAY ONE CAN EXPLAIN IT ONE CAN OPEN IT AND CAN SHOW HOW MUCH THOUGHT WENT TO MAKING IT
TO THE POOR FISHERMAN TO THE PEASANT'S ROOF TO EVERY ONE WHO DWELLS FAR AWAY FROM YOU AND FROM YOUR COURT I LOVE YOUR HEART MORE THAN YOUR CROWN AND YET THE CROWN HAS AN AIR OF SANCTITY ABOUT IT I WILL COME AND SING TO YOU
WITHOUT BEING STRUCK WITH BLINDNESS THE CHAPLAIN OF HORB NOW ENTERED THE PULPIT AND SOLEMNLY ADDRESSED THE PERMITIANT THEN THE LATTER TOOK HIS PLACE
NEXT MORNING A CLEAR BRIGHT DAY ROSE UPON THE VILLAGE
CAPTAINS AND NOTABLES AND THEY MARRIED THE TWO BROTHERS TO THE TWO SISTERS THE CONTRACTS WERE WRITTEN OUT AND THE TWO KINGS BESTOWED ROBES OF HONOR OF SILK AND SATIN ON THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT
THAT LOVE FOR FORM THAT PERFECTION OF STYLE WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LATIN RACES AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TEUTONIC IT IS THIS THAT MAKES THE ORLANDO FURIOSO THE GREAT EPIC OF THE RENAISSANCE
WHOSE BOUNTY LIKE A SPRING OF WATER SWEET MAY HEAL HIS WOES A FRIEND WHO STRAIGHT WILL SAY COME IN TIS TIME THY STAFF ASIDE TO LAY BUT THERE CAME OUT TO ME A BOY IN A SHORT TUNIC WHO SAID
MIGHT HAVE THE CONVENIENCE OF SAILING UP TO IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BEAUTY OF THE MEADOWS AND GROVES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROYAL PALACES WITH LOFTY GILDED ROOFS THAT ADORNED IT MADE IT EVEN RIVAL THE GRANDEUR OF ROME
AND SHE WAS EVEN AS SAITH THE POET OF HER IN THESE COUPLETS THE SUN OF BEAUTY SHE TO ALL APPEARS AND LOVELY COY SHE MOCKS ALL LOVELINESS
EVEN AS SAITH OF HER ONE IN THESE COUPLETS SHE COMES LIKE FULLEST MOON ON HAPPY NIGHT TAPER OF WAIST WITH SHAPE OF MAGIC MIGHT
AND FOR THE MORE SOLEMN OBSERVATION OF THAT FESTIVAL AND RECONCILING THE MINDS OF THE PRINCES THAT WERE NOW SUBJECT TO HIM RESOLVED DURING THAT SEASON TO HOLD A MAGNIFICENT COURT TO PLACE THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD
WERE TO BE SEEN THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS AND TO THE PRETTIEST OF THEM SILVER BELLS WERE TIED WHICH TINKLED SO THAT NOBODY SHOULD PASS BY WITHOUT NOTICING THE FLOWERS YES EVERYTHING IN THE EMPEROR'S GARDEN WAS NICELY SET OUT
OF HER CYNE SHE SHOOTS SHAFTS THAT AT FURTHEST RANGE ON MARK ALIGHT THEN THEY RETURNED TO DUNYAZAD AND DISPLAYED HER IN THE FIFTH DRESS
THE GOLD TO THE DUST WHERE YET IT REMAINETH AS USELESS TO MORTALS AS IN FOREGOING ERAS ROUND THE DEAD MOUND RODE THEN THE DOUGHTY IN BATTLE
STIFF AND PALE HE LAY ON THE GORGEOUS BED WITH THE LONG VELVET CURTAINS AND THE HEAVY GOLD TASSELS HIGH UP A WINDOW STOOD OPEN AND THE MOON SHONE IN UPON THE EMPEROR AND THE TOY BIRD
I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL IS THERE SUCH A BIRD IN MY EMPIRE AND IN MY GARDEN TO BOOT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE HAS TO READ ABOUT SUCH THINGS HEREUPON HE CALLED HIS CAVALIER
BITE WITH VIPER BITE HER SIDES ARE SILKEN SOFT WHAT WHILE THE HEART MERE ROCK BEHIND THAT SURFACE SCAPES OUR SIGHT FROM THE FRINGED CURTAINS
WHILE OTHERS PASSED OUT WITH EMPTY BOWLS UNDER THEIR ARMS THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT SPEAKING THEY HAD BROUGHT WEDDING PRESENTS FOR THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO WAS TO BE MARRIED TO HIS BRIDE THE CHURCH
BUT ONE THING YOU MUST PROMISE ME EVERYTHING SAID THE EMPEROR AND HE STOOD THERE IN HIS ROYAL ROBES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON HIMSELF AND PRESSED THE SWORD WHICH WAS HEAVY WITH GOLD TO HIS HEART ONE THING I BEG OF YOU
FIVE YEARS HAD GONE BY AND A REAL GRIEF CAME UPON THE WHOLE NATION THE CHINESE WERE REALLY FOND OF THEIR EMPEROR AND NOW HE WAS SICK AND COULD NOT IT WAS SAID LIVE MUCH LONGER
TOO LATE I CLOSED THE BLIND ALAS LIST THERE'S ANOTHER TRUMP THERE TWO OF EM TWO A QUINTETTE AT LEAST MOSQUITO CHORUS A AH MY CHEEK
MY FRIEND ALWAYS CARRIED A SMALL THERMOMETER IN HER TRUNK WHICH SHE CONSULTED A DOZEN TIMES AN HOUR IN ORDER TO REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM ALAS FOR ME IF THE QUICKSILVER ROSE ABOVE SIXTY
THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER ASSURES HIM THAT THE STARS ALWAYS APPEAR SO TO HER AND HE TURNS TO LOOK IN HER FACE HE SAYS WHY MOTHER HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK PLEASE TO GIVE ME SOME LITTLE SPECTACLES ALL MY OWN
AND OH AGAIN MY EYELID I GAVE MYSELF A STUNNING CUFF ON THE EAR AND ALL IN VAIN FLAP WE OUR HANDKERCHIEF
GLIDES THE YOUTHFUL PAIR TO THE ALTAR GREEN WITH BROW SERENE AND KNEEL TOGETHER THERE SOFT BREATHES THE VOW RESPONSIVE NOW IN CALM BUT
EARNEST TONE THE WEDDING RING STRANGE MYSTIC THING FAST BINDS THE TWAIN IN ONE THE SOLEMN WORD NO LONGER HEARD WITH CHASTENED STEPS AND SLOW
AN HONEST TAR FROM ONE OF THE MEN OF WAR EMPLOYED IN UNLOADING COAL AT WILLARD'S WHARF TOOK THE CAPTAIN'S GIG
EVENING I AM BOOKED FOR A HORSEBACK RIDE WITH LITTLE HANDSOME TO MORROW MORNING HOW DID SHE MAKE ME OFFER I DID NOT MEAN TO ALL COUNTRY GIRLS RIDE I BELIEVE
HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
WHILE I AM TALKING NONSENSE WITH LITTLE HANDSOME
SEE THAT LITTLE BOY WHO HAVING PUT ON HIS FATHER'S SPECTACLES IS ENJOYING FOR THE FIRST TIME A CLEAR AND DISTINCT VIEW OF THE EVENING SKY OH IS THAT PRETTY LITTLE YELLOW DOT A STAR EXCLAIMS THE DELIGHTED CHILD
I ONLY KNOW I HAVE NOT BEEN SO THOROUGHLY CONTENT SINCE THE ACQUISITION OF MY FIRST JACKKNIFE NOR SO PROUD SINCE THE DAY WHEN I FIRST SPORTED A SHINING BEAVER I HAVE CONQUERED ETTY'S DISTRUST SHE HAS ACTUALLY PROMISED ME HER FRIENDSHIP
AND BOARDS LAID ALONG THE TOPS OF THE PEWS AND WERE APPARENTLY JUST COMPLETING THE DECORATION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS ALREADY DRESSED WITH GREEN WITH LITTLE TREES IN THE CORNERS AND WITH GREEN LETTERS UPON THE WALLS
AND INDISPUTABLY PRAISEWORTHY SHE WAS SO GOOD NATURED HOWEVER AND SO HAPPY IN HER DELUSION THAT I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO REMONSTRATE VERY VEHEMENTLY EXCEPT WHEN SHE WOULD MAKE ME LISTEN TO HER INTERMINABLE LECTURES UPON THE IMPORTANCE
AND THE CHILDEN CHIMES IN WITH THEIR PLAINTIVE BOO HOO HOW HOLY THE CALM IN THE STILLNESS OF NEUNE WHEN THE POT
IF AUNT TABITHA WANTS ANY LITTLE ATTENTION A NEEDLE THREADED OR A DROPPED STITCH TAKEN UP MISS ETTY QUIETLY COMES TO HER AID IT IS SO ENTIRELY A MATTER OF COURSE
I LIKE ESPECIALLY TO RATTLE ON WHEN ANY NONSENSE WILL DO CHAT IS TRULY AGREEABLE WHEN ONE'S BRAINS ARE NOT SEVERELY TAXED TO KEEP IT GOING
I WAS EXCEEDINGLY WELL AMUSED MAKING ALL THE SAUCY SPEECHES I COULD THINK OF IN THE PURE SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF AND TAKING NO NOTICE OF HER TOSSING HER PRETTY HEAD AND TURNING HER BACK UPON ME FINDING THAT HER
AND SEE WHO THIS VERY MERRY PERSONAGE MAY BE I WILL INQUIRE INTO THIS GAY OUTBREAK IN A LAND OF STUPIDITY HARK AGAIN HOW REFRESHING I MUST AND WILL KNOW WHAT CAUSED SUCH A GUSH OF MIRTH IRISH HUMOR PERHAPS
AND LIME ROCK GRAY THREW BACK THE RAY ACROSS THE RAPID FLOOD THOUGH COLD EACH FORM THEIR LOVE STILL WARM FROM HEARTH AND LATTICE GLOWS
IN COLLEGE I WAS THE ILLUSTRIOUS LAZY IN MY PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AND AVOCATIONS I HAVE BEEN SO HARD DRIVEN IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR FOUR IDLE YEARS
AS I WAS DEBATING WHETHER TO WRITE TO ETHELIND OVER THE TOP RETURNING THAT WAY AFTER MY RAMBLE I FOUND THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION PINNED TO THE TREE BY A JACKKNIFE HOW HOLY THE CALM
I MOURNED OVER THE BROAD OLD FASHIONED DIAL ON WHICH YOUNG EYES COULD DISCERN THE TIME A MILE OFF THE OLD SEXTON LIVED TO SEE THIS CHANGE
ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF WHICH NATHAN IS A MEMBER AS THE SADDLER MOUNTED THE STEPS OF HIS SHOP HE FELT THE BLOOD SO RUSH ALONG HIS LIMBS AND TINGLE IN HIS FINGERS
IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
AWAITS THE BLUSHING BRIDE ONE LOOK ABOVE THEN SMILES OF LOVE EXPRESS HER JOY AND PRIDE ONCE MORE GOOD CHEER REMOVES THE TEAR
ONE MUST NOT PRESUME TO SET HER RIGHT IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR SINGERS ARE PROVERBIALLY IRRITABLE
AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
AND UNDERNEATH WAS ADDED AS IF IN SCORN OF MY FRUITLESS ENDEAVOR I WROTE THAT ARE RIGHT OFF AS FAST AS YOU COULD SHELL CORN S P
THEY COME THEY LEAP THEY SCAMPER IN ERE GRATING ON ITS HINGES SLAMS THE DOOR INEXORABLE PAUSES THE SLUGGARD AT WOOD AND HALL'S JUST CROSSING
SO I WENT TO CHURCH HAVING WALKED IN THE GRAVEYARD TILL THE BELL RANG OWL THAT YOU ARE I DON'T ENVY YOU THE LIVELY MEDITATIONS YOU MUST HAVE HAD WHY DON'T YOU GO IT'S OF NO USE WAITING FOR ME WHAT
LAST STROKE IT DIES AWAY LIKE MURMURING WAVE BOOTLESS HE CAME AND BOOTLESS WENDS HE BACK GNAWING HIS GLOVELESS THUMB AND PACING SLOW BRIGHT EYES MIGHT GAZE ON HIM
T IS BUT THE EARLIEST THE WARNING PEAL HE SLEEPS AGAIN HAPPY IF BUSTLING CHUM FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE ENTRY OR PERCHANCE IN THE HOME BOWER MATERNAL KNOCK
IF SUCH THERE BE FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE IMPORTANT I WISH MY HAIR WAS CUT I HEAR MY AUNT COMING TO INFORM ME OF FLORA'S ARRIVAL I SHALL BE HUGELY SURPRISED HUMPH WILL IT BE WORTH WHILE TO TROUBLE MYSELF ABOUT THE
VERY EARNESTLY I USED TO GAZE AT THE SLENDER POINT BY WHICH IT HUNG SUSPENDED AND WISHED IF IT MUST COME DOWN THAT I MIGHT MAKE THE GILT ORNAMENT AT THE APEX RESEMBLING A VASE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN MY PRIZE
I BEG YOU TO BELIEVE IS NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT CLAIM TO A GLANCE OF APPROBATION NOW AND THEN FROM A LADY'S EYE YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE I CARE AT ALL ABOUT THE MATTER BUT AS I HAVE NOT EVEN A BOOK
INSTEAD OF HEATING IT THERE WAS NO SUCH FUSS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES THESE AIRY NOTIONS HAD NOT COME INTO FASHION WHERE THE LOOSE WINDOW SASHES RATTLED AT EVERY PASSING BREEZE AND THE WIND CHASED THE SMOKE DOWN THE WIDE MOUTHED CHIMNEY
O'ER ROCK AND WOOD THICK STORM CLOUDS BROOD AND DOUBTS OUR STEPS DELAY NO BEACON LIGHT YET CHEERS THE NIGHT HOW GLOOMY GROWS THE HOUR AH
SHE NEVER FORGOT IT AND ALWAYS PACKED IT VERY CAREFULLY TOO I ASKED HER TWO OR THREE TIMES TO LET ME PUT IT IN MY TRUNK WHERE I HAD SLYLY ARRANGED A NICE LITTLE PLACE FULL OF HARD SURFACES AND SHARP CORNERS BUT SHE ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF ROOM
LISTEN METHOUGHT I HEARD DELICIOUS MUSIC FAINT AND AFAR PRAY IS THE BOAT CLUB OUT DO THE PIERIAN MINSTRELS MEET TO NIGHT OR CHIME THE BELLS OF BOSTON OR THE PORT
WEARY I TOSS AND THINK T IS ALMOST DAWN SO STILL THE STREETS BUT NOW THE LATEST TRAIN WHISTLING MELODIOUSLY COMES IN THE TRAMP OF FEET
VERY NOISY AND FULLY BENT UPON STIRRING ME UP AND MAKING ME TAKE EXERCISE AFTER SNAPPING THE DOOR OPEN AND SLAMMING IT BEHIND HER WITH A CLAP THAT GREATLY DISTURBED MY NERVES SHE EXCLAIMED IN A STENTORIAN VOICE
AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
THE LATEST BUS DOWN BRATTLE STREET GOES RUMBLING LABORERS HIE HOME BY TWOS AND THREES HOMELIEST PHIZZES VOICES HIGH PITCHED AND TONGUES WITH TELLTALE BURR R R R THE SHORT STEMMED PIPE
IN MERRY MERRY MOOD
I DO NOT OBJECT TO SEE THEM AT A DISTANCE QUIETLY GRAZING IN A MEADOW BY THE BRINK OF A WINDING STREAM AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING PROVIDED THE DISTANCE IS VERY GREAT AND A STRONG FENCE INTERVENES FOR
SAID LITTLE UGLY COLDLY ENOUGH WHY NOT NO ANSWER TO BE SURE HE MIGHT HEAR HE WOULD FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE MUSICAL WHAT OF THAT
AND SHALL I SAY THAT YOU SENT THIS A VIEW OF MY STRANGE PHIZ WILL NOT REFRESH THE OLD PEOPLE LIKE THE SIGHT OF FLORA'S FRESH YOUNG FACE BUT I SHALL GO IN AND MAKE THE AGREEABLE AS WELL AS I CAN
BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
I HAVE NO RIGHT HOWEVER TO TAKE IT UPON ME TO INSTRUCT HER AND IT PUTS HER IN A PET
I DEVOUTLY HOPED SHE WOULD LEAVE IT BEHIND IN SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS STOPPING PLACES AND WITH AN EYE TO THAT POSSIBILITY I MUST CONFESS I HUNG IT IN THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY CORNERS I COULD FIND BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ON HER MIND CONTINUALLY
WHICH CONTRAST SO STRONGLY WITH THE HARDSHIPS OF EARLY TIMES THE ACKNOWLEDGED SLEEPINESS OF MODERN CONGREGATIONS FOR MY PART I SEE NO NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN DISCOMFORT AND DEVOTION
AND TROT ME AND WASH MY FACE IN MY HELPLESS INFANCY
NO INDEED WE RAN SHIVERING THROUGH THE LONG WINDY ENTRIES ALL WRAPPED IN SHAWLS AND HUGGING OURSELVES TO RETAIN THE FRIENDLY WARMTH OF THE FIRE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FAR FROM DEVISING WAYS OF LETTING IN THE AIR WE TRIED HARD TO KEEP IT OUT
PLEASE DON'T IF I WILL MEND IT WHEN I THINK OF IT WILL YOU SING A DUET YES THOUGH IT WILL COST ME MORE THAN YOU KNOW POH AND FLORA SANG THE SONG
AND SUDDEN DRAUGHTS FROM AN OPENING DOOR SET OUR TEETH CHATTERING I OFTEN WISHED MYSELF ON A SPIT TO REVOLVE SLOWLY BEFORE THE FIRE UNTIL THOROUGHLY ROASTED NOT FROM ANY WANT OF AIR I ASSURE YOU
I BANISH ALL BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT FROM MY TABLE I STUDIOUSLY AVOID ALL NOTORIOUS FRESH AIR LOVERS OR TRY IN EVERY WAY TO BRING OVER THE POOR MISGUIDED MORTALS TO MY VIEWS BUT IT IS OF NO USE FRESH AIR IS THE FASHION
WHO FIRST INVENTED BED O WONDROUS SOFT THIS PILLOW TO MY WEARY HEAD RIGHT SOON MY DIZZY THOUGHTS SHALL O'ER THE BRINK OF SLEEP FALL INTO CHAOS AND BE LOST I DREAM
I ADMIRE COWS IN THEIR PROPER PLACES THEY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY USEFUL ANIMALS SOME MAY THINK THEM HANDSOME AND GRACEFUL THIS IS AS YET AN UNSETTLED QUESTION
HOVERING HIGH WITH THAT CONTINUOUS HUM I FAIN WOULD REST COME DO THY WORST AT ONCE BITE SCOUNDREL BITE THOU INSECT VULTURE SEIZE THY HELPLESS PREY NO CEREMONY
IT IS SUCH A TRIFLE TO DO IT IS NOT WORTH REFUSING
THE DEWY TWILIGHT OF A SUMMER EVE TIRED MORTALS LOUNGE AT CASEMENT OR AT DOOR WHILE DEEPENING SHADOWS GATHER ROUND NO LAMP SAVE IN YON SHOP
AND AT LAST MADE AN EMBARRASSED HALF BOW HALF COURTESY TO THE COMPANY IN GENERAL A CONFUSED MURMUR OF GREETINGS AND INTRODUCTIONS FOLLOWED AND THROWING ASIDE MY AIR OF STIFF CEREMONIOUS POLITENESS
I WERE LESS FATIGUED LESS SLEEPY SLEEP I INVOKE THEE COMFORTABLE BIRD THAT BROODEST O'ER THE TROUBLED WAVES OF LIFE AND HUSHEST THEM TO PEACE ALL HAIL THE MAN
SHE MADE NO ANSWER BUT LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE WITH ONE OF THOSE WONDROUS SMILES IT WENT AS STRAIGHT TO MY HEART AS A PISTOL BULLET COULD DO MY HIGH INDIGNATION PROVING NO DEFENCE AGAINST IT
NOW COMES MINE ENEMY NOT SILENTLY BUT WITH INSULTING AND DEFIANT WARNING COME BANQUET IF THOU WILT I OFFER THEE MY CHEEK MY ARM TEASE ME NOT
THE SERVICES CURTAILED TO HALF THEIR PROPER LENGTH YET FINDING THE PATIENCE OF THE LISTENERS ALL TOO SHORT THE DEGENERATE DESCENDANTS CARRIED THE DAY HOWEVER
SLOWLY I RISE ON DOWNY PINIONS DREAMING I FLY I SOAR THROUGH THE CLOUDS MY WAY I'M WINGING ANGELS TO THEIR HARPS ARE SINGING STRAINS OF UNEARTHLY SWEETNESS LULL ME
THAT LIGHT HAS SHONE ALIKE O'ER GREEN OR SNOW SINCE FIRST A PAIR THEIR NEST BUILT THERE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO NOW AS WE WALK WITH PLEASANT TALK
BY STUFFING THE CRACKS WITH COTTON AND CLOSELY CURTAINING THE WINDOWS AND BED EVEN THEN THE ICE IN THE WASH BASIN AND THE ELECTRICITY WHICH MADE OUR HAIR LITERALLY STAND ON END IN THE PROCESS OF COMBING AND THE GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION OF FINGERS INTO THUMBS
TANGLE HER FOOT IN THE STIRRUP OR RIDING SKIRT FAINT FALL BREAK HER NECK O HORRORS WILL NOT THE DEAR OLD AUNT TABITHA FORBID HER GOING WHAT A WELL PROPORTIONED AND LADYLIKE FIGURE IT WAS
TO CHEER THE DISMAL WAY THAT LIGHT SHALL TELL OF MARRIAGE BELL OF MOON AND MERRY SLEIGH THE ANCIENT HOME TO WHICH WE COME THESE SCENES REVEALED ONE NIGHT
SOME WITH BLACK SILK CAPS TO PROTECT THEIR BALD HEADS FROM THE FREEZING DRAUGHTS OF AIR FROM THE PORCHLESS DOORS THE OLD WOMEN'S SEATS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
FAINTER NOW AND FARTHER THE TINY WAR WHOOP NOW I HEAR IT NOT A COWARDLY ASSASSIN HE HE WAITS FULL WELL AWARE THAT I AM ON THE ALERT WITH MURDEROUS INTENT
I CAN'T DO HIM ANY GOOD IT IS DUSTY AND MY GOWN IS LONG IT WOULD PLEASE HIM TO SEE YOU I WENT TO SIT WITH HIM YESTERDAY BUT TIMOTHY DIGFORT CAME IN WITH THE SAME INTENT
I COULD NOT MAKE NORAH TELL ME WHAT MISS ETTY PUT UNDER HER ARM AS SHE LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER AT ME AND DARTED OUT OF SIGHT O MY NOISY BOOTS I MIGHT AS WELL WEAR A BELL ROUND MY NECK STAGE WHEELS ARE RATTLING UP THE ROAD
I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND SURPRISED IT WAS A GOOD OPENING FOR EGOTISM AND I IMPROVED IT
THE TERRORS OF THAT DARK MYSTERIOUS CELL HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON MY CONDUCT HOWEVER AS I WAS NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH LYNX EYED FUNCTIONARY
JUST AS A STAY AT HOME WIFE LECTURES A GAY HUSBAND WHO NEVER RETURNS TO HIS BETTER HALF WHEN HE FINDS ANY THING TO AMUSE HIM ABROAD GOOD BY OLD FELLOW I HAVE FOUND BETTER COMPANY THAN YOUR REMEMBERINGS OR HOPINGS TO WIT
IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
AND THEIR FLANKS ARE FROSTED O'ER A FITFUL LIGHT SCARCE YET IN SIGHT GLEAMS THROUGH THE OPENING WOOD AH NOW THEY COME TO THEIR HILL SIDE HOME
HOW VERY LOVELY ETTY LOOKED SITTING ON A CRICKET AT THE OLD WOMAN'S FEET AND WITH A HALF SMILE ON HER FACE SUBMITTING HER POLISHED LITTLE HEAD TO BE STROKED BY HER TREMBLING HANDS THIS I SAW OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE HARK
ALTHOUGH A GOOD DEAL STOOPING WITH LONG STRAIGHT AND VERY WHITE HAIR FALLING OVER HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM THE BLACK VELVET CAP AS IT APPEARED THAT HE WORE
PEERING ABOVE EACH GRACEFUL SHEPHERD'S PLAID THE CHIN ENFOLDING SEE HOW THE PURPLE HUE OF YOUTH AND HEALTH GLOWS IN EACH CHEEK HOW THE SHARP WIND BRINGS PEARLS FROM EVERY EYE
AND OUR LESSON WAS THAT WE MUST NEVER TAKE WITHOUT ASKING
WILL YOU LET HER GO WITH ME MARCELLA MARCELLA FINALLY AGREED AND WHEN THE STRANGER FRIEND LEFT HE PLACED RAGGEDY ANN IN HIS GRIP
SAID RAGGEDY ANN AND MISTRESS CAN FIND THEM THERE IN THE MORNING HOW LOVELY SAID ALL THE DOLLS IN CHORUS DO MAMMA CAT
I CAN EASILY DO THAT CRIED THE TIN SOLDIER AS HE RAISED HIS GUN OH RAGGEDY ANN CRIED THE FRENCH DOLLY PLEASE DO NOT LET HIM SHOOT NO SAID RAGGEDY ANN
ALL THE DOLLS RAN TO WHERE UNCLE CLEM WAS DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES THIS MUST BE THE PLACE SAID RAGGEDY ANN
AND IF THAT DID NOT HURT HOW COULD THE SCRATCH OF A KITTEN FINALLY BOOTS FELT ASHAMED OF HERSELF AND WENT OVER AND LAY DOWN BY THE HOLE IN THE WALL IN HOPES THE MOUSE WOULD RETURN BUT THE MOUSE NEVER RETURNED
RAGGEDY ANN DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR IT SQUEAK BUT SHE DID NOT WISH JEANETTE TO HAVE HER WAX FACE CHEWED AGAIN EITHER SO RAGGEDY ANN SAID TO THE TINY LITTLE MOUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO COME HERE WHEN BOOTS IS WITH US
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS HAPPENING THE TIDE FAIRIES WERE UNCOVERING FREDDY WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY UNCOVERED THE TIDE FAIRIES SWAM WITH FREDDY WAY OUT TO THE UNDERTOW FAIRIES
BUT YOU KNOW CATS CAN SCRATCH VERY HARD IF THEY WANT TO WE WILL TELL RAGGEDY WHEN SHE COMES IN SAID THE FRENCH DOLL AND THEN FIDO WENT OUT TO PLAY WITH A NEIGHBOR DOG
AS SHE WATCHED THE LITTLE MOUSE CRAWLING TOWARDS THE HOLE SCARCELY ABLE TO MOVE RAGGEDY ANN COULD NOT KEEP THE TEARS FROM HER SHOE BUTTON EYES FINALLY AS BOOTS STARTED TO SPRING AFTER THE LITTLE MOUSE AGAIN
SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE BUT WITH A MORE EXPANSIVE SMILE THAN EVER BEFORE RAGGEDY ANN KNEW JUST HOW IT ALL HAPPENED AND HER REMAINING SHOE BUTTON EYE TWINKLED
MAMMA AND DADDY SAID THE KITTENS COULD STAY IN THE NURSERY AND BELONG TO MARCELLA
OH THAT IS EVER SO MUCH BETTER CRIED RAGGEDY ANN NOW I CAN THINK QUITE CLEARLY NOW RAGGEDY CAN THINK QUITE CLEARLY CRIED ALL THE DOLLS
I INTEND KEEPING THIS A SECRET BUT ALL THE FOLKS AT THIS HOUSE ARE VERY KINDLY PEOPLE AND WOULD DEARLY LOVE YOUR KITTENS CRIED ALL THE DOLLS LET'S TAKE THEM RIGHT UP TO THE NURSERY
JUST THEN THE WIND TWISTED THE LITTLE DUTCH DOLL AND LOOSENED HIS CLOTHES PIN SO THAT HE FELL TO THE GRASS BELOW WITH A SAWDUSTY BUMP
BUT MY WHAT A CHATTER THERE WAS IN THE NURSERY THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER RAGGEDY ANN RETURNED ALL THE DOLLS WERE SO ANXIOUS TO HUG RAGGEDY ANN THEY COULD SCARCELY WAIT UNTIL MARCELLA HAD LEFT THEM ALONE WHEN THEY HAD SQUEEZED RAGGEDY ANN ALMOST OUT OF SHAPE
SAID THE DOLLIES EACH NIGHT WE MISS HER HAPPY PAINTED SMILE AND HER CHEERY WAYS THEY SAID AND SO THE WEEK DRAGGED BY
BUT NO SHE FLOATED NICELY FOR SHE WAS STUFFED WITH CLEAN WHITE COTTON AND THE WATER DIDN'T SOAK THROUGH VERY QUICKLY AFTER A WHILE THE STRANGE PUPPY AND FIDO GREW TIRED OF RUNNING ALONG THE BANK AND THE STRANGE PUPPY SCAMPERED HOME OVER THE MEADOW
CRIED THE FRENCH DOLLY BUT ALL OF MY SISTER DOLLS HAVE SMILES JUST LIKE MINE REPLIED RAGGEDY ANN AND SHOE BUTTON EYES THE DOLLS ALL ASKED YES
THEN THEY WERE PLACED IN THEIR BEDS AND MISTRESS KISSED EACH ONE GOOD NIGHT AND TIPTOED FROM THE ROOM ALL THE DOLLS LAY AS STILL AS MICE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN RAGGEDY ANN RAISED UP ON HER COTTON STUFFED ELBOWS AND SAID
AND SURE ENOUGH ALL THE DOLLIES SMELLED SOMETHING WHICH THEY KNEW MUST BE VERY GOOD TO EAT BUT NONE OF THE DOLLIES WAS TALL ENOUGH TO OPEN THE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH THEY PUSHED AND PULLED WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
BUT IT TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL FOR DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO FREDDY NO WHAT DID HAPPEN TO HIM MARCELLA ASKED WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN FREDDY WAS COVERED WITH THE SAND HE ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY
FINALLY RAGGEDY ANN DREW AWAY FROM THE OTHERS AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR WHEN THE OTHER DOLLIES DISCOVERED RAGGEDY ANN SITTING THERE RUNNING HER RAG HANDS THROUGH HER YARN HAIR THEY KNEW SHE WAS THINKING SH
THEN SHE TOOK RAGGEDY ANN INTO THE HOUSE AND SHOWED MARCELLA AND MAMMA HOW CLEAN AND SWEET SHE WAS
SO SHE PROMISED TO SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN BOOTS WAS THE ONLY ONE AWAKE OUT POPPED A TINY MOUSE FROM THE HOLE
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT MAMMA SHE CRIED I REMEMBER NOW THAT I THREW DEAR OLD RAGGEDY ANN FROM ME AS I RAN OUT THE DOOR AND SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER OH DEAR OH DEAR AND SHE HUGGED RAGGEDY ANN TIGHT
SHE CARRIED ME BY A DOOR NEAR THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND I SMELLED SOMETHING WHICH SMELLED AS IF IT WOULD TASTE DELICIOUS THEN YOU LEAD THE WAY RAGGEDY ANN CRIED THE FRENCH DOLLY
THE UNDERTOW FAIRIES TOOK FREDDY AND SWAM WITH HIM WAY OUT TO THE ROLLER FAIRIES
SOME OF THE DOLLS HAD BEEN PUT IN THE LITTLE RED CHAIRS AROUND THE LITTLE DOLL TABLE THERE WAS NOTHING TO EAT UPON THE TABLE EXCEPT A TURKEY
AND WHEN THE FRONT GATE CLICKED AND THE DOLLIES KNEW THEY WERE ALONE IN THE HOUSE THEY ALL SCRAMBLED TO THEIR FEET
BUT WHEN SHE LET GO OF THE FROWN HER FACE STRETCHED RIGHT BACK INTO HER USUAL CHEERY SMILE AND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY TOO FOR SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO JEANETTE SOMETHING OR SOMEONE
WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED THE TIN SOLDIER WINKED AT THE DUTCH BOY DOLL AND HANDED THE IMITATION TURKEY TO THE PENNY DOLLS
RAGGEDY ANN WAITED FOR MARCELLA TO RETURN AND AS SHE WATCHED THE LITTLE ANTS EATING COOKIE CRUMBS MARCELLA HAD THROWN TO THEM SHE HEARD ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PATTER OF PUPPY FEET BEHIND HER IT WAS FIDO
RAGGEDY ANN AND THE WASHING WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU MAMMA LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAW MARCELLA RUN UP TO DINAH AND TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HER HAND AND THEN PUT HER HEAD IN HER ARM AND COMMENCE CRYING
I MEAN SAID RAGGEDY ANN THAT THE STRANGER FRIEND HAD BORROWED ME FROM MARCELLA SO THAT HE COULD HAVE PATTERNS MADE FROM ME AND BEFORE I LEFT THE BIG CLEAN WHITE ROOM
RAGGEDY ANN JUMPED FROM HER BED AND RAN OVER TO FIDO'S BASKET HE WASN'T THERE
RAGGEDY ANN TRIED TO LOOK VERY STERN BUT SHE COULD NOT HIDE THE BROAD SMILE PAINTED ON HER FACE OH YOU WANT TO PLAY DO YOU THE PUPPY DOG BARKED AS HE JUMPED AT RAGGEDY ANN AND THEN JUMPED BACK AGAIN
NOW IT HAPPENED RAGGEDY LIT IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER AND THERE SHE LAY ALL DOUBLED UP IN A KNOT A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS DINAH CAME THROUGH THE HALL WITH AN ARMFUL OF CLOTHES AND PILED THEM IN THE HAMPER ON TOP OF RAGGEDY ANN
SO SHE TOOK ALL EXCEPT RAGGEDY ANN INTO THE HOUSE AND PUT THEM TO BED FOR THE AFTERNOON NAP THEN MARCELLA TOLD RAGGEDY ANN TO STAY THERE AND WATCH THE THINGS AS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
THERE THE DOLLS HUNG ALL DAY SWINGING AND TWISTING ABOUT AS THE BREEZE SWAYED THE CLOTHES LINE I DO BELIEVE SHE SCRUBBED MY FACE SO HARD SHE WORE OFF MY SMILE
HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE PIANO MARCELLA PICKED UP RAGGEDY ANN AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE NURSERY WHEN SHE LEFT TELLING THE DOLLS TO BE REAL GOOD CHILDREN WHILE MAMMA IS AWAY
VIRGINIA AND DORIS REMEMBERED FREDDY AND RAN DOWN TO GET HIM
WHEN RAGGEDY ANN TOOK HER ARMS FROM AROUND BOOTS THE KITTEN WAS VERY ANGRY SHE LAID HER EARS BACK AND SCRATCHED RAGGEDY ANN WITH HER CLAWS BUT RAGGEDY ANN ONLY SMILED IT DID NOT HURT HER A BIT FOR RAGGEDY WAS SEWED TOGETHER WITH A NEEDLE AND THREAD
I AM SO HAPPY I DO NOT FEEL A BIT SLEEPY DO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THE WATER SOAKED ME SO THOROUGHLY MY CANDY HEART MUST HAVE MELTED AND FILLED MY WHOLE BODY
THAT WILL BE EASY SAID THE DUTCH DOLL WHO SAYS MAMMA WHEN HE IS TIPPED BACKWARD AND FORWARD FOR WE WILL HAVE THE BRAVE TIN SOLDIER SHOOT THE KEY OUT OF THE LOCK
PRINCE CHARMING FOR THE WHITE KITTY CINDERELLA FOR THE MALTESE AND PRINCESS GOLDEN FOR THE KITTY WITH THE YELLOW STRIPES SO THAT IS HOW THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS CAME TO LIVE IN THE NURSERY
CRIED ALL THE DOLLS I CAN'T SEEM TO THINK CLEARLY TO DAY SAID RAGGEDY ANN IT FEELS AS IF MY HEAD WERE RIPPED AT THIS THE FRENCH DOLL RAN TO RAGGEDY ANN AND TOOK OFF HER BONNET
THE DOLLS ALL SAT UPON THE FLOOR AROUND RAGGEDY ANN THE TIN SOLDIER WITH HIS ARM OVER HER SHOULDER WELL FIRST WHEN I LEFT SAID RAGGEDY ANN I WAS PLACED IN THE STRANGER FRIEND'S GRIP
NONE THE WORSE FOR HIS WONDERFUL ADVENTURE FREDDY MUST HAVE ENJOYED IT AND YOUR LITTLE GIRLS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO GET FREDDY BACK AGAIN SAID MARCELLA RAGGEDY ANN WENT UP IN THE AIR ON THE TAIL OF A KITE ONE DAY
WHAT IS THE TROUBLE DEAR MAMMA ASKED AS SHE CAME OUT THE DOOR AND KNELT BESIDE THE LITTLE FIGURE SHAKING WITH SOBS MARCELLA HELD OUT RAGGEDY ANN BUT SUCH A COMICAL LOOKING RAGGEDY ANN
RAGGEDY ANN WANTED TO GIVE THE KITTENS HER BED BUT FIDO WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PROVE HIS AFFECTION
BUT BOOTS ONLY GROWLED THE DOLLS DREW TO ONE SIDE WHERE RAGGEDY ANN AND UNCLE CLEM WHISPERED TOGETHER AND WHILE THEY WHISPERED BOOTS WOULD LET THE LITTLE MAMMA MOUSE RUN A PIECE THEN SHE WOULD CATCH IT AGAIN
SH THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER AND QUIETLY WENT OVER NEAR RAGGEDY ANN AND SAT DOWN IN FRONT OF HER THERE MUST BE A WAY TO GET INSIDE SAID RAGGEDY ANN RAGGEDY SAYS THERE MUST BE A WAY TO GET INSIDE
WHICH MADE IT A BEAUTIFUL LAVENDER COLOR AND LITTLE BABY TEENY WEENY COOKIES WITH POWDERED SUGAR ON THEM AFTER THIS LOVELY DINNER THE DOLLIES WERE TAKEN IN THE HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD THEIR HAIR BRUSHED AND NICE CLEAN NIGHTIES PUT ON
THE STRANGER WAS A LARGE MAN WITH KINDLY EYES AND A CHEERY SMILE AS PLEASANT AS RAGGEDY ANN'S HE TOOK MARCELLA UPON HIS KNEE AND RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HER CURLS AS HE TALKED TO DADDY AND MAMMA
THEN I WAS PUT BACK IN THE GRIP WHEN NEXT I WAS TAKEN FROM THE GRIP I WAS IN A LARGE CLEAN LIGHT ROOM AND THERE WERE MANY MANY GIRLS ALL DRESSED IN WHITE APRONS
RAGGEDY ANN SAID SO THE INDIAN RAN AND BROUGHT A BOTTLE OF GLUE WHERE'S THE HAND RAGGEDY ASKED
AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW MAMMA CAT CAME BOUNCING RIGHT AT ME WITH HER EYES LOOKING GREEN
SHAME ON YOU RAGGEDY ANN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE PANTRY AND ALL THE OTHERS TOO AND WITH THIS THE DOLLS MISTRESS DROPPED RAGGEDY ANN ON THE FLOOR AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE HAD ON AN APRON AND HER SLEEVES WERE ROLLED UP
BUT OF COURSE SHE DIDN'T HOWEVER THE GAME DIDN'T LAST MUCH LONGER AS RAGGEDY ANN HIT THE GROUND THE NEW PUPPY DOG CAUGHT HER DRESS AND RAN WITH HER ACROSS THE BRIDGE FIDO BARKING CLOSE BEHIND HIM
THERE WHERE HUNDREDS OF RAG DOLLS SO LIKE ME YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL US APART
AND IS VERY WISE SO AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PERSUASION MAMMA CAT FINALLY CONSENTED RAGGEDY ANN TOOK TWO OF THE KITTENS AND CARRIED THEM TO THE HOUSE WHILE MAMMA CAT CARRIED THE OTHER
RAGGEDY ANN ASKED NO THE LITTLE MOUSE ANSWERED I WAS VISITING THE MICE INSIDE THE WALLS AND WANDERED OUT HERE TO PICK UP CAKE CRUMBS I HAVE THREE LITTLE BABY MICE AT HOME DOWN IN THE BARN
AND BOX IT ABOUT BETWEEN HER PAWS THIS SHE DID UNTIL THE POOR LITTLE MAMMA MOUSE GREW SO TIRED IT COULD SCARCELY RUN AWAY FROM BOOTS
ASKED RAGGEDY ANN WITH A LAUGH BY FEELING YOUR CANDY HEART IF THE DOLL HAS A CANDY HEART THEN IT IS YOU RAGGEDY ANN
DINAH COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND AND AS SHE DEARLY LOVED MARCELLA SHE WAS TROUBLED RAGGEDY ANN WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DOWNHEARTED AND WHILE SHE FELT SHE MUST LOOK VERY FUNNY
EXCEPT THAT I AM MORE WORN FOR EACH NEW RAG DOLL HAS A CANDY HEART AND ON IT IS WRITTEN I LOVE YOU JUST AS IS WRITTEN ON MY OWN CANDY HEART
AND SCRAMBLED BACK TO THEIR ROOM AS FAST AS THEY COULD RUN LEAVING A TRAIL OF BREAD CRUMBS AND JAM ALONG THE WAY
THIS IS RAGGEDY ANN ANSWERED FIDO SHE AND I ARE HAVING A LOVELY TIME PLAYING YOU SEE FIDO REALLY THOUGHT RAGGEDY ENJOYED BEING TOSSED AROUND AND WHIRLED HIGH UP IN THE AIR
WHEN THE WATER BEGAN TO GET WARM RAGGEDY ANN WIGGLED AROUND AND CLIMBED UP AMONGST THE CLOTHES TO THE TOP OF THE BOILER TO PEEK OUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH STEAM AND SHE COULD SEE NOTHING FOR THAT MATTER
SO RAGGEDY ANN VERY PROUD INDEED TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE AND LOVE OF ALL THE OTHER DOLLIES SAID THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO BE THEIR LEADER FOLLOW ME SHE CRIED
AND IT ALL TURNED OUT JUST AS RAGGEDY ANN HAD SAID FOR HER HEAD WAS STUFFED WITH CLEAN WHITE COTTON AND SHE COULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY WISE THOUGHTS AND MAMMA CAT FOUND OUT THAT FIDO WAS A VERY GOOD FRIEND TOO
RAGGEDY ANN LEARNS A LESSON ONE DAY THE DOLLS WERE LEFT ALL TO THEMSELVES THEIR LITTLE MISTRESS HAD PLACED THEM ALL AROUND THE ROOM AND TOLD THEM TO BE NICE CHILDREN WHILE SHE WAS AWAY
EVEN THOUGH HER BED WAS RIGHT ON TOP OF RAGGEDY ANN SHE COULD NOT SLEEP BUT RAGGEDY ANN WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE BOOTS SLEEP WITH HER EVEN IF SHE WAS HEAVY AND WHEN BOOTS BEGAN CRYING FOR HER MAMMA RAGGEDY ANN COMFORTED HER
SO LET US ALL REMEMBER AND TRY NEVER AGAIN TO DO ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT CAUSE THOSE WHO LOVE US ANY UNHAPPINESS LET US ALL REMEMBER
RAGGEDY ANN ASKED HERSELF WHEN SHE SAW MARCELLA'S SORROWFUL FACE FOR RAGGEDY ANN WAS NEVER SELFISH DADDY WILL TAKE JEANETTE DOWN TOWN WITH HIM AND HAVE HER FIXED UP AS GOOD AS NEW SAID MAMMA
AND THERE THEY SAT AND NEVER EVEN SO MUCH AS WIGGLED A FINGER UNTIL THEIR MISTRESS HAD LEFT THE ROOM THEN THE SOLDIER DOLLY TURNED HIS HEAD AND SOLEMNLY WINKED AT RAGGEDY ANN
RAGGEDY ANN'S NEW SISTERS MARCELLA WAS HAVING A TEA PARTY UP IN THE NURSERY WHEN DADDY CALLED TO HER
AND WATCHED MY SISTERS GROW FROM PIECES OF CLOTH INTO RAG DOLLS JUST LIKE MYSELF YOUR SISTERS THE DOLLS ALL EXCLAIMED IN ASTONISHMENT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE STOPPING AND PRETENDING HE WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE PRETENDED THIS FIDO WOULD GIVE RAGGEDY ANN A GREAT SHAKING MAKING HER YARN HEAD HIT THE GROUND RATTY TAT TAT
HE WALKED OVER TO THE TABLE AND SNIFFED IN HOPES MARCELLA HAD GIVEN THE DOLLS REAL FOOD AND THAT SOME WOULD STILL BE LEFT WHERE'S RAGGEDY ANN FIDO ASKED
THEY WERE ALL LEFT SITTING IN THEIR PLACES AROUND THE ROOM I WONDER IF FIDO HAS BEEN SHAKING THEM UP THEN SHE SAW RAGGEDY ANN'S FACE AND PICKED HER UP WHY RAGGEDY ANN YOU ARE ALL STICKY
THEN DINAH CARRIED THE HAMPER OUT IN BACK OF THE HOUSE WHERE SHE DID THE WASHING DINAH DUMPED ALL THE CLOTHES INTO THE BOILER AND POURED WATER ON THEM THE BOILER WAS THEN PLACED UPON THE STOVE
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT IN THE BARN AND LIVE WHERE YOU WILL NOT DESTROY ANYTHING OF VALUE I DID NOT KNOW SQUEAKED THE LITTLE MOUSE
AND SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER NOW BY THIS TIME BOOTS WAS ONE OF THE FAMILY AND DID NOT CRY AT NIGHT BESIDES
AND WRAPPED A RAG AROUND IT TO HOLD IT UNTIL THE GLUE DRIED SHE SAID WHEN I TELL YOU OF THIS WONDERFUL ADVENTURE I KNOW YOU WILL ALL FEEL VERY HAPPY IT HAS MADE ME ALMOST BURST MY STITCHES WITH JOY
BUT PRESENTLY FREDDY FELT THE SAND ABOVE HIM MOVE AS IF SOMEONE WAS DIGGING HIM OUT
WHO CARRIED HIM TO THE WIND FAIRIES AND THE WIND FAIRIES MARCELLA ASKED BREATHLESSLY
THEN SHE WOULD JUMP AT HER AND OVER AND OVER THEY WOULD ROLL THEIR HEADS HITTING THE FLOOR BUMPITY BUMP BOOTS SLEPT IN THE NURSERY THAT NIGHT AND WAS LONELY FOR HER MAMMA FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME
EXACTLY LIKE MINE I KNOW HOW WE COULD TELL YOU FROM THE OTHER RAG DOLLS EVEN IF YOU ALL LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE SAID THE INDIAN DOLL WHO HAD BEEN THINKING FOR A LONG TIME
WHEN DADDY FISHED RAGGEDY ANN FROM THE WATER MARCELLA HUGGED HER SO TIGHTLY TO HER BREAST THE WATER RAN FROM RAGGEDY ANN AND DRIPPED ALL OVER MARCELLA'S APRON BUT MARCELLA WAS SO GLAD TO FIND RAGGEDY ANN AGAIN SHE DIDN'T MIND IT A BIT
THE PUPPY DOG RAN UP TO RAGGEDY ANN AND TWISTED HIS HEAD ABOUT AS HE LOOKED AT HER THEN HE PUT HIS FRONT FEET OUT AND BARKED IN RAGGEDY ANN'S FACE

WITH THEE WERE THE DREAMS OF MY EARLIEST LOVE EVERY THOUGHT OF MY REASON WAS THINE IN MY LAST HUMBLE PRAYER TO THE SPIRIT ABOVE THY NAME SHALL BE MINGLED WITH MINE
WHEN WE HOPE TO FIND AND THINK TO BURST OUT INTO SUDDEN BLAZE COMES THE BLIND FURY WITH THE ABHORRED SHEARS AND SLITS THE THIN SPUN LIFE BUT NOT THE PRAISE
EARLY OR LATE THEY STOOP TO FATE AND MUST GIVE UP THEIR MURMURING BREATH WHEN THEY PALE CAPTIVES CREEP TO DEATH THE GARLANDS WITHER ON YOUR BROW
AT EVERY FAMOUS VICTORY THEY SAY IT WAS A SHOCKING SIGHT AFTER THE FIELD WAS WON FOR MANY THOUSAND BODIES HERE LAY ROTTING IN THE SUN

AND MUST GRIEVE WHEN EVEN THE SHADE OF THAT WHICH ONCE WAS GREAT HAS PASS'D AWAY
SO FAR AS THE LIMITATIONS OF ITS RANGE ALLOW ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE NATURAL GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF OUR POETRY A RIGIDLY CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE HOWEVER RATHER FITS A COLLECTION AIMING AT INSTRUCTION THAN AT PLEASURE
HAVE BEEN REJECTED AS ALIEN FROM WHAT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD BY SONG AND RARELY CONFORMING TO LYRICAL CONDITIONS IN TREATMENT BUT IT IS NOT ANTICIPATED NOR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL READERS SHALL THINK THE LINE ACCURATELY DRAWN
AND WEARY WINTER COMIN FAST AND COZIE HERE BENEATH THE BLAST THOU THOUGHT TO DWELL TILL CRASH THE CRUEL COULTER PAST OUT THRO THY CELL
THE HIGHER HE'S A GETTING THE SOONER WILL HIS RACE BE RUN AND NEARER HE'S TO SETTING THAT AGE IS BEST WHICH IS THE FIRST WHEN YOUTH AND BLOOD ARE WARMER
TO EVERY SENSE BUT FELT THROUGH ALL THIS FLESHLY DRESS BRIGHT SHOOTS OF EVERLASTINGNESS O HOW I LONG TO TRAVEL BACK AND TREAD AGAIN THAT ANCIENT TRACK
OF THE NIGHT FOR THE MORROW THE DEVOTION TO SOMETHING AFAR FROM THE SPHERE OF OUR SORROW
BRAVE URIEN SLEEPS UPON HIS CRAGGY BED MOUNTAINS YE MOURN IN VAIN MODRED WHOSE MAGIC SONG MADE HUGE PLINLIMMON BOW HIS CLOUD TOPT HEAD ON DREARY ARVON'S SHORE THEY LIE SMEAR'D WITH GORE AND GHASTLY PALE

NOT IN SHEET OR IN SHROUD WE WOUND HIM BUT HE LAY LIKE A WARRIOR TAKING HIS REST WITH HIS MARTIAL CLOAK AROUND HIM FEW AND SHORT WERE THE PRAYERS WE SAID AND WE SPOKE NOT A WORD OF SORROW
AND ON THE EDGE LIKE TO THAT SANGUINE FLOWER INSCRIBED WITH WOE AH WHO HATH REFT QUOTH HE MY DEAREST PLEDGE LAST CAME AND LAST DID GO
HER VERY FROWNS ARE FAIRER FAR THAN SMILES OF OTHER MAIDENS ARE H COLERIDGE
WITH THAT I SAW TWO SWANS OF GOODLY HUE COME SOFTLY SWIMMING DOWN ALONG THE LEE TWO FAIRER BIRDS I YET DID NEVER SEE THE SNOW WHICH DOTH THE TOP OF PINDUS STROW DID NEVER WHITER SHOW
THOU WHO ART VICTORY AND LAW WHEN EMPTY TERRORS OVERAWE FROM VAIN TEMPTATIONS DOST SET FREE
PROTHALAMION CALM WAS THE DAY AND THROUGH THE TREMBLING AIR SWEET BREATHING ZEPHYRUS DID SOFTLY PLAY A GENTLE SPIRIT THAT LIGHTLY DID DELAY HOT TITAN'S BEAMS WHICH THEN DID GLISTER FAIR
AND FREEDOM'S FAME FINDS WINGS ON EVERY WIND CHILLON THY PRISON IS A HOLY PLACE AND THY SAD FLOOR AN ALTAR FOR TWAS TROD UNTIL HIS VERY STEPS HAVE LEFT A TRACE
HERE SHALL HE SEE NO ENEMY BUT WINTER AND ROUGH WEATHER

BESIDE SOME WATER'S RUSHY BRINK WITH ME THE MUSE SHALL SIT AND THINK AT EASE RECLINED IN RUSTIC STATE
UNITY OR TRUTH THAT A FEW GOOD LINES DO NOT MAKE A GOOD POEM THAT POPULAR ESTIMATE IS SERVICEABLE AS A GUIDEPOST MORE THAN AS A COMPASS ABOVE ALL THAT EXCELLENCE SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR

AND HER ARMS ALONG THE DEEP PROUDLY SHONE BY EACH GUN THE LIGHTED BRAND IN A BOLD DETERMINED HAND AND THE PRINCE OF ALL THE LAND LED THEM ON
NOR GAZE UPON THE SPOT THERE FLOWERS AND WEEDS AT WILL MAY GROW SO I BEHOLD THEM NOT IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO PROVE THAT WHAT I LOVED AND LONG MUST LOVE LIKE COMMON EARTH CAN ROT
MORE BY YOUR NUMBER THAN YOUR LIGHT YOU COMMON PEOPLE OF THE SKIES WHAT ARE YOU WHEN THE MOON SHALL RISE
SO FORTH THOSE JOYOUS BIRDS DID PASS ALONG ADOWN THE LEE THAT TO THEM MURMUR'D LOW AS HE WOULD SPEAK BUT THAT HE LACK'D A TONGUE YET DID BY SIGNS HIS GLAD AFFECTION SHOW MAKING HIS STREAM RUN SLOW
I SUPPLICATE FOR THY CONTROUL BUT IN THE QUIETNESS OF THOUGHT
YOUTH IS FULL OF PLEASANCE AGE IS FULL OF CARE YOUTH LIKE SUMMER MORN AGE LIKE WINTER WEATHER YOUTH LIKE SUMMER BRAVE AGE LIKE WINTER BARE YOUTH IS FULL OF SPORT AGE'S BREATH IS SHORT
O LET MY WEAKNESS HAVE AN END GIVE UNTO ME MADE LOWLY WISE THE SPIRIT OF SELF SACRIFICE THE CONFIDENCE OF REASON GIVE AND IN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH THY BONDMAN
THAT FROM BENEATH THE SEAT OF JOVE DOTH SPRING BEGIN AND SOMEWHAT LOUDLY SWEEP THE STRING HENCE WITH DENIAL VAIN AND COY EXCUSE SO MAY SOME GENTLE MUSE WITH LUCKY WORDS
AND THEIR BEST SERVICE LEND AGAINST THEIR WEDDING DAY WHICH WAS NOT LONG SWEET THAMES RUN SOFTLY TILL I END MY SONG
THAT WEE BIT HEAP O LEAVES AN STIBBLE HAS COST THEE MONY A WEARY NIBBLE
HE MUST NOT FLOAT UPON HIS WATERY BIER UNWEPT AND WELTER TO THE PARCHING WIND WITHOUT THE MEED OF SOME MELODIOUS TEAR BEGIN THEN SISTERS OF THE SACRED WELL
THE POPLAR FIELD THE POPLARS ARE FELL'D FAREWELL TO THE SHADE AND THE WHISPERING SOUND OF THE COOL COLONNADE THE WINDS PLAY NO LONGER AND SING IN THE LEAVES

I KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE A FUSS ALMA BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE CHARLIE SO WE JUST TOOK MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS IT WAS SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC TOO I'D ALWAYS SAID I'D NEVER BE MARRIED IN ANY OF YOUR DULL COMMONPLACE WAYS
WELL THEY WERE GOOD LETTERS ANYHOW SAID GILBERT FINALLY INTERESTING LETTERS HE ADDED AS IF BY WAY OF A MEDITATIVE AFTERTHOUGHT IT WAS SO ANTI CLIMACTIC THAT ALMA BROKE INTO AN HYSTERICAL GIGGLE CUT SHORT BY A SOB

CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME GILBERT SHE SAID HUMBLY I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH TO FORGIVE HE ANSWERED I HAVE SOME EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE TOO AND SINCE WE'RE AT IT WE MIGHT AS WELL GET THEM ALL OVER AND HAVE DONE WITH THEM
HE HAD ALWAYS WISHED THAT ANNA'S EYES HAD NOT BEEN QUITE SO BLACK ANNA IS NOT HERE SAID ALMA SHE IS MARRIED MARRIED GILBERT SAT DOWN SUDDENLY ON A CHAIR AND LOOKED AT ALMA IN BEWILDERMENT

ALEXANDER MAC NAIR HAD GONE TO THE WEST TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY AND GOT WORK ON A NEW RAILROAD HE WROTE TO GILBERT TO COME TOO PROMISING HIM PLENTY OF WORK AND GOOD PAY GILBERT WENT BUT BEFORE GOING HE HAD ASKED ANNA TO MARRY HIM
HE MUST CERTAINLY SOON HEAR OF ANNA'S MARRIAGE HE WOULD SEE IT IN THE HOME PAPER OTHER CORRESPONDENTS IN EXETER WOULD WRITE HIM OF IT ALMA GREW SICK AT HEART
APART FROM LINE OR FEATURE WHICH DID NOT PLEASE ALAN
SHE MUST BE ADA FRAME'S DAUGHTER THEN EXCLAIMED MISSUS KNOWLES IN EXCITEMENT THEN SEEING PAULINE'S PUZZLED FACE SHE EXPLAINED YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD I ALWAYS SPENT MY SUMMERS ON THE FARM OF MY UNCLE JOHN FRAME MY COUSIN ADA FRAME WAS THE DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OVER TO SEE US VERY LATELY MISTER DOUGLAS
AS HE HAD THAT DAY RESCUED HER FROM BODILY DANGER
THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
NOW THAT HE NOTICED AS SHE STOOD RIGIDLY THERE WITH THAT QUEER RED SPOT ON HER FACE A STRANGE FIRE IN HER EYES AND THAT WEIRD REFLECTION FROM THE MAPLE ENVELOPING HER LIKE AN IMMATERIAL FLAME
TO LEAD HER INTO DEARER LIGHT ALAN DOUGLAS WAS A SINCERE MAN WITH HIMSELF AS WELL AS WITH OTHERS
IF I'M ONE YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THE OTHER I'M THE OTHER SHAKE SAID PAULINE HOLDING OUT HER HAND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A FRIENDSHIP THAT MADE POOR MISSUS WALLACE GROAN OUTWARDLY AS WELL AS INWARDLY
WHICH TODAY WAS WOUND ABOUT HER HEAD WHEN SHE DROPPED BACK BESIDE HIM IN THE WIDER SPACES HE COULD ONLY HAVE STOLEN GLANCES AT HER PROFILE DELICATELY STRONGLY CUT VIRGINAL IN ITS SOFT CURVES CHILDLIKE IN ITS PURITY
SAT QUICKLY UP AS HE ASKED HIS QUESTION DEAR ME YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF CAPTAIN ANTHONY CAPTAIN ANTHONY OLIVER SAID MISSUS DANBY HE LIVES DOWN THERE AT FOUR WINDS AS THEY CALL IT HE AND HIS DAUGHTER AND AN OLD COUSIN
I'VE ALWAYS CARED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL COMING HERE TO SCHOOL AND BREAKING MY HEART OVER MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH I HATED THEM JUST TO BE IN YOUR CLASS WHY WHY
THOUGH SHE IS DOUBTLESS UNCONVENTIONAL HAVING SAID ALL THIS I DO NOT SEE WHAT MORE THERE IS TO BE SAID AND I AM GOING TO WRITE THIS SERMON ALAN WROTE IT
OH AUNTY DEAR CAN'T YOU SEE THAT ADA IS JUST THE SAME GIRL IN COTTON PRINT THAT SHE WOULD BE IN SILK ATTIRE SHE IS REALLY FAR MORE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING THAN ANY GIRL IN THE KNOWLES SET PAULINE SAID AUNT OLIVIA LOOKING AS SHOCKED AS IF PAULINE HAD COMMITTED BLASPHEMY
LYNDE LAY MOVELESSLY HER FACE WAS WHITE AND BOTH FEAR AND APPEAL WERE VISIBLE IN HER LARGE DILATED EYES YET SHE WAS QUITE CALM AND A FAINT SMILE CROSSED HER PALE LIPS AS SHE SAW THE MAN AND THE DOG GOOD FAITHFUL PAT SO YOU DID BRING HELP SHE SAID
ANNA WAS IN EARNEST ALMA KNEW THAT EVEN WHILE SHE HOPED AND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS BUT THE EARNESTNESS OF A FREAK THAT WOULD PASS IN TIME ANNA HAD HAD ONE LIKE IT A YEAR AGO WHEN SHE HAD CAST GILBERT OFF FOR THREE MONTHS
QUITE UNDISTURBED BY THE JEALOUSIES AND HEART BURNINGS SHE PROVOKED ON EVERY SIDE ONE MOONLIGHT NIGHT SHE WENT FOR A SLEIGH DRIVE WITH CHARLIE MOORE OF EAST EXETER AND RETURNED TO TELL ALMA THAT THEY WERE MARRIED
I WANTED TO GET ACQUAINTED ALL OVER AGAIN BEFORE SHE GREW BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I WANTED TO FIND THE REAL ANNA THE LETTERS SHOWED ME I
BUT ALAN DISCOVERED HIM TO BE SURPRISINGLY WELL READ IN POLITICS AND SCIENCE
ALAN HATED DOCTRINES THE SOUL'S STAYLACES HE CALLED THEM BUT ELDER TREWIN WAS A MAN TO BE RECKONED WITH AND ALAN PREACHED AN OCCASIONAL SERMON TO PLEASE HIM IT'S NO USE HE SAID WEARILY
THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
WAS REPEATED IN HER SON AND THE RESEMBLANCE WAS STRIKING AS HE STOOD IN THE SEARCHING EVENING SUNSHINE THE BLACK HAIR GREW AROUND HIS FOREHEAD IN THE SAME WAY HIS EYES WERE STEEL BLUE LIKE HERS WITH A SIMILAR EXPRESSION
YOU SAVED MY LIFE SHE SAID YOU AND PAT FOR DOGGIE MUST HAVE HIS SHARE OF CREDIT A MUCH LARGER SHARE THAN MINE SAID ALAN SMILING IF PAT HAD NOT COME FOR ME I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN OF YOUR DANGER WHAT A MAGNIFICENT FELLOW HE IS
PAULINE LAUGHED AGAIN BUT SHE SIGHED AS SHE WENT TO HER ROOM AUNT OLIVIA HAS THE KINDEST HEART IN THE WORLD SHE THOUGHT WHAT A PITY SHE ISN'T ABLE TO SEE THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ADA CAN'T BE PERFECT IF I CAN'T INVITE HER TO MY HOME
HAD NOT THAT MARRIAGE BEEN HER DEAREST WISH FOR YEARS WHY THEN SHOULD SHE FEEL THIS STRANGE GLADNESS AT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ITS FULFILMENT ALTOGETHER ALMA FEARED THAT HER CONDITION OF MIND AND MORALS MUST BE SADLY ASKEW
HER DEPARTING LAUGH RIPPLING MOCKINGLY THROUGH THE DUSK ALMA PICKED UP GILBERT MURRAY'S LETTER AND WENT TO HER ROOM SHE WANTED TO CRY SINCE SHE COULD NOT SHAKE ANNA EVEN IF SHE COULD HAVE SHOOK HER IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE HER MORE PERVERSE
MUCH MORE THAN PROFESSIONAL INTEREST ISABEL HERSELF SHOWED IT WITH SUFFICIENT DISTINCTNESS MOREOVER HE FELT A CERTAIN PERSONAL DISLIKE OF HER AND OF HER HARD INSISTENT BEAUTY
SO STRONG THAT HE KNEW HE MUST GO BACK TO IT SOMETIME MEANWHILE THE GREAT LAKE MIMICKING THE SEA IN ITS VAST EXPANSE AND THE STORMS THAT OFTEN SWEPT OVER IT WAS HIS COMFORT AND SOLACE
THE YOUNG WOMEN HE KNEW IN REXTON WHOSE SIMPLE PLEASANT FRIENDSHIP HE VALUED
BUT TO HEAR AUNT OLIVIA TALK NOW YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT SHE AND NOT PAULINE HAD DISCOVERED ADA
THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE EMBREE GARDEN WHERE PAULINE WAS PREPARING TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADA STANDING AMONG THE ASTERS WITH A GREAT SHEAF OF THEM IN HER ARMS
JUST WHAT I SAY DEAR RESPONDED ANNA WITH DECEPTIVE MEEKNESS POOR GILBERT IS GONE AND I DON'T INTEND TO BOTHER MY HEAD ABOUT HIM ANY LONGER HE WAS AMUSING WHILE HE LASTED BUT OF WHAT USE IS A BEAU TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY ALMA
MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
BUT THEY HAVE A LARGE FAMILY AND ARE NOT VERY WELL OFF SO I THINK I'LL TRY FOR A SITUATION IN ONE OF THE REMINGTON STORES THIS FALL IT'S SUCH A PITY YOU COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO THE ACADEMY AND STUDIED FOR A TEACHER'S LICENCE SAID PAULINE
FATHER AND EMILY ARE AWAY I THINK I AM QUITE SAFE HERE IF I DON'T MOVE AT ALL
SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICHEST MAN IN REXTON AND INCLINED TO GIVE HERSELF AIRS ON THAT ACCOUNT BUT ALAN'S GENTLE INDIFFERENCE ALWAYS BROUGHT HOME TO HER AN UNWELCOME FEELING OF INFERIORITY YOU'VE BEEN TIRING YOURSELF OUT AGAIN TRAMPING THAT LAKE SHORE I SUPPOSE
WHEN I CAME HERE I SAW SOME JUNEBELLS GROWING RIGHT OUT ON THE LEDGE AND I CREPT OUT TO GATHER THEM
TALL FAIR AND GREY EYED WITH THE SUNSET LIGHT COMING DOWN OVER THE DARK FIRS THROUGH THE WINDOW BEHIND HER AND MAKING A PRIMROSE NIMBUS AROUND HER SHAPELY HEAD
IF HIS OBJECT WERE TO PROLONG THE CONVERSATION ABOUT LYNDE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE OLD WOMAN HAD TURNED ABRUPTLY TO HER WORK AGAIN AND THOUGH ALAN LINGERED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LONGER SHE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF HIM
SHE KNEW IT WAS HER AUNT'S DEAREST DESIRE TO GET IN WITH THE MORGAN KNOWLES SET A DESIRE THAT SEEMED AS FAR FROM BEING REALIZED AS EVER MISSUS WALLACE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THE MORGAN KNOWLES SHUT HER FROM THEIR CHARMED CIRCLE
A POWER WHICH HER HITHERTO UNFETTERED SPIRIT HAD NEVER BEFORE FELT THE COLD INDIFFERENCE HE HAD SEEN IN HER FACE AT THEIR FIRST MEETING WAS GONE AND SOMETHING TOLD HIM IT WAS GONE FOREVER
THEN HE TURNED AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER QUIZZICALLY ALMA'S HANDS LAY LIMPLY IN HER LAP AND HER EYES WERE CAST DOWN WITH TEARS GLISTENING ON THE LONG FAIR LASHES SHE FELT HIS GAZE ON HER
OF CAPTAIN ANTHONY HE NEVER GOT EVEN A GLIMPSE
PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT MOURNFULLY THIS PERVERSION OF PROPER FEELING WAS HER PUNISHMENT FOR THE DECEPTION SHE HAD PRACTISED SHE HAD DELIBERATELY DONE EVIL THAT GOOD MIGHT COME
AND ALAN WAS HALF REPENTING THE IMPULSE WHICH HAD LED HIM TO CHOOSE IT WHEN HE SUDDENLY CAME OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PINES AND FOUND HIMSELF GAZING ON A SIGHT WHICH AMAZED HIM BEFORE HIM WAS A SMALL PENINSULA RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE
HALF A MILE DOWN THE CLIFFS WERE ROCKY AND PRECIPITOUS WHILE THE BEACH BENEATH THEM WAS HEAPED WITH HUGE BOULDERS ALAN FOLLOWED THE DOG ALONG ONE OF THE NARROW PATHS WITH WHICH THE BARRENS ABOUNDED UNTIL NEARLY A MILE FROM FOUR WINDS THEN THE ANIMAL HALTED
IT WAS THE SMARTEST EVENT OF THE TERM AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OF COURSE SYLVIA GRANT SYLVIA LOOKED STUNNING
BUT HE FINALLY CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD NOT
WHEN SHE CAME WITHIN HIS REACH HE GRASPED HER ARMS AND LIFTED HER UP INTO SAFETY BESIDE HIM THANK GOD HE SAID WITH WHITER LIPS THAN HER OWN FOR A FEW MOMENTS LYNDE SAT SILENT ON THE SOD
AND IF I CAN ONLY GET THAT COVE WITH ALL ITS BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS IT WILL BE THE GEM OF MY COLLECTION
BORDERED BY ITS WHITE ORCHARDS ISABEL PUT HER OWN CONSTRUCTION ON HIS ABSENT REPLIES TO HER REMARKS AND PRESENTLY SHE ASKED HIM DID YOU THINK LYNDE OLIVER HANDSOME THE QUESTION GAVE ALAN AN ANNOYANCE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO ITS SIGNIFICANCE
FOR AT HER FIRST MOVEMENT THE SOIL BENEATH HER SLIPPED AWAY ALAN'S HEART SICKENED WHAT IF SHE WENT WITH IT COULD SHE CLING TO THE ROPE WHILE HE DREW HER UP THEN HE SAW SHE WAS STILL SAFE ON THE SLOPING SHELF CAREFULLY AND PAINFULLY SHE DREW HERSELF TO HER KNEES
I SHALL TAKE AS MY TEXT INSTEAD THE FLOWERS APPEAR ON THE EARTH THE TIME OF THE SINGING OF BIRDS HAS COME
SYLVIA STILL LOOKED SMILING AND HAPPY NOT A BIT MAD AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT JUST KIND OF SHY AND RADIANT AS FOR THE OLD FELLOW HE LOOKED AS EM WHITE WOULD SAY AS SPHINX LIKE AS EVER
THE TRUTH WAS THAT ALMA WAS STUNNED BY A THOUGHT THAT HAD COME TO HER EVEN WHILE ANNA WAS SPEAKING GILBERT WILL FIND OUT ABOUT THE LETTERS NOW AND DESPISE ME NOTHING ELSE NOT EVEN THE FACT THAT ANNA HAD MARRIED SHIFTLESS CHARLIE MOORE
PAULINE HID A RATHER UNDUTIFUL SMILE BEHIND HER NAPKIN AUNT OLIVIA'S SNOBBISH OPINIONS ALWAYS AMUSED HER YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT AN INTERESTING OLD MAN HE IS SHE SAID HE CAN TALK MORE ENTERTAININGLY THAN ANY OTHER MAN I KNOW
DO I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS WILD UNWOMANLY HEATHENISH AS MISSUS DANBY SAYS NO I DO NOT MOST EMPHATICALLY
AND IT WAS THE FACE OF A BLITHE MAN WHO HAD NOT HEARD ANY EVIL TIDINGS IT WAS LEFT TO HER TO TELL HIM SURELY SHE THOUGHT APATHETICALLY THAT WAS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB SHE PAUSED
I SHOULDN'T SUPPOSE IT COULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHO SHE IS SAID MISSUS WALLACE IMPATIENTLY I DO WISH PAULINE THAT YOU WERE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR CHOICE OF ASSOCIATES YOU HOBNOB WITH EVERYONE
YOU MIGHT ANSWER IT YOURSELF ALMA SHE SAID TEASINGLY THERE IT IS SHE TOOK THE LETTER FROM THE POCKET OF HER RUFFLED APRON AND THREW IT ON A CHAIR YOU MAY READ IT IF YOU WANT TO IT ISN'T REALLY A LOVE LETTER
EMPHASIZED THE GRACE AND STRENGTH OF HER SUPPLE FORM HER FACE WAS OVAL AND PALE WITH STRAIGHT BLACK BROWS AND A FINELY CUT CRIMSON MOUTH A FACE WHOSE BEAUTY BORE THE INDEFINABLE STAMP OF RACE AND BREEDING MINGLED WITH A WILD SWEETNESS
I THINK MANY DOGS ARE MUCH MORE LOVABLE AND WORTHY OF LOVE THAN MANY PEOPLE SAID ALAN LAUGHING HOW CHILDLIKE SHE WAS IN SOME WAYS THAT TRACE OF DEFIANCE IT WAS SO LIKE A CHILD WHO EXPECTED TO BE SCOLDED FOR SOME WRONG ATTITUDE OF MIND
YET HE INEVITABLY WENT
ANNA YOU CANNOT BE IN EARNEST EXCLAIMED ALMA BUT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT ANNA WAS IN EARNEST ANNA HAD A WRETCHED HABIT OF BEING IN EARNEST WHEN SHE SAID FLIPPANT THINGS
HE KEEPS A YACHT AND GOES SAILING IN IT SOMETIMES HE CRUISES ABOUT FOR WEEKS THAT'S ABOUT ALL HE EVER DOES AND NOW YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE OLIVERS AS I DO MISTER DOUGLAS ALAN HAD LISTENED TO THIS GOSSIPY NARRATIVE WITH AN INTEREST THAT DID NOT ESCAPE ISABEL KING'S OBSERVANT EYES
BUT AFTER WE GREW UP WE SAW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR I WENT WITH MY PARENTS TO EUROPE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ADA MARRIED A NEIGHBOUR'S SON ALEC CAMERON AND WENT OUT WEST
SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
OUTSIDE OF WHICH A YOUNG VINE WAS GLOWING IN SOFT TENDER GREEN TINTS ITS SMALL DAINTY LEAVES CASTING QUIVERING SHADOWS ON THE OPPOSITE WALL WHERE THE PORTRAIT OF ALAN'S MOTHER HUNG SHE HAD A FINE STRONG SWEET FACE THE SAME FACE CAST IN A MASCULINE MOULD
HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS ANY HOUSE NEAR THE LAKE SHORE HAD NEVER HEARD MENTION MADE OF ANY YET HERE WAS ONE AND ONE WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY OCCUPIED FOR A SLENDER SPIRAL OF SMOKE WAS CURLING UPWARD FROM IT ON THE CHILLY SPRING AIR
THEY WALKED ROWED BERRIED AND PICNICKED TOGETHER ADA DID NOT GO TO MISSUS BOYD'S A GREAT DEAL FOR SOME INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT MISSUS WALLACE DID NOT LOOK FAVOURABLY ON HER
I BELIEVE SHE IS SAID PAULINE QUICKLY ADA WAS BORN OUT WEST AND LIVED THERE UNTIL SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HER PARENTS DIED AND SHE WAS SENT EAST TO HER FATHER'S HALF SISTER
WON'T YOU PLEASE STOP A FEW MOMENTS AND LOOK ME OVER
BUT WAS A LAW UNTO HERSELF ALMA SAT DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE LANE WHERE THE SLIM WILD CHERRY TREES WERE BRONZING UNDER THE AUTUMN FROSTS HER LIPS WERE VERY FIRMLY SET SOMETHING MUST BE DONE BUT WHAT
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
AND THE SUMMER FRIENDSHIP PROVED A LIFE LONG ONE AND WAS FOR THE WALLACES THE OPEN SESAME TO THE ENCHANTED GROUND OF THE KNOWLES
ALMA BALANCED PROS AND CONS ADMITTING THE RISK BUT SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN A TENFOLD LARGER RISK IN THE HOPE OF HOLDING SECURE ANNA'S PLACE IN GILBERT'S AFFECTIONS UNTIL ANNA HERSELF SHOULD COME TO HER SENSES
THERE SEEMED NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT TO GO WAIT A MOMENT
ALMA WAS PATIENT OUTWARDLY IT WAS NEVER OF ANY AVAIL TO SHOW IMPATIENCE WITH ANNA ANNA YOU ARE TALKING FOOLISHLY OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER HIS LETTER YOU ARE AS GOOD AS ENGAGED TO HIM
GILBERT DETERMINED TO GET RID OF IT AND HIS THOUGHTS TURNED TO THE WEST HIS FATHER WAS AN ACTIVE HALE OLD MAN QUITE CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE FARM IN GILBERT'S ABSENCE
AND THOUGHT OUT WHAT SHE MUST SAY HER MEMORY WORKED AUTOMATICALLY AND HER TONGUE OBEYED IT PROMPTLY TO HERSELF SHE SEEMED LIKE A MACHINE TALKING MECHANICALLY WHILE HER SOUL STOOD ON ONE SIDE AND LISTENED
I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND KISSED HER CHEEK IN HIS FRANK DELIGHT AT SEEING HER AGAIN ALMA COLDLY ASKED HIM IN HER FACE WAS STILL AS PALE AS WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
BUT HAD BEEN CARRIED THERE BY MERCHANTS OR VOYAGERS FROM THE FAR EAST WHERE WAS ITS HOME BUT IT SPREAD SO RAPIDLY AMONG THE NATIVES THAT BEFORE LONG IT SEEMED AS IF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN THE CRADLE OF THIS TERRIBLE SCOURGE THIS WAS DUE WE ARE TOLD
THE FIRST ONE WHERE WOMEN WERE TO CARE FOR THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD FALLEN IN WAR THEY CROSSED THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND ARRIVED AT BOULOGNE IN FRANCE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
THAT SEEMED TO RUN IN HIS FAMILY FOR HIS FATHER HAD SERVED IN THE NAVY IN THE TIME OF HENRY THE EIGHTH AND HIS COUSIN SIR JOHN HAWKINS WAS SAILING TO THE COAST OF GUINEA TO BRING BACK SLAVES THE TALENT THAT DRAKE HAD FOR THE SEA
DRAKE WAS THE OLDEST OF A FAMILY OF TWELVE SONS AND WAS BORN IN DEVONSHIRE IN FIFTEEN THIRTY NINE HE WAS AN ACTIVE AND ADVENTUROUS BOY FOND OF ALL ATHLETIC GAMES AND EARLY SHOWING A TASTE FOR THE SEA
INSTEAD OF THIS THEY DUG THEIR OWN GRAVES FOR BRUCE SLEW ALL THREE WITH HIS OWN HAND ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE TOOK REFUGE WITH A SINGLE COMPANION IN A DESERTED HOUSE WHERE THREE MORE ENEMIES ENDEAVORED TO KILL HIM AS HE SLEPT
AND THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN INFLICTED FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO THE BARON WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR BARON I AM TOO ILL TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON
AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
AND THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF LORD RAGLAN RODE THROUGH SLEET AND MUD FOR HOURS TO VISIT HER PERSONALLY SHE DID NOT DIE HOWEVER BUT RECOVERED TO TAKE UP AGAIN HER DUTIES AS CHIEF NURSE AND ORGANIZER
AND AS THE GREAT WINGS OF SATAN ROSE HE SPRANG BENEATH THEM WITH DANTE FOLLOWING HIM GRASPING THE HAIRY SIDE OF THE MONSTER THEY COMMENCED TO DESCEND STILL LOWER AND SOON TO DANTE'S AMAZEMENT THEIR DOWNWARD PATH BECAME AN UPWARD ONE
AND BEFORE LONG ACCOMPANIED HAWKINS ON HIS TRIPS TO GUINEA AFTER NEGRO SLAVES TRIPS IN WHICH DRAKE WAS ALWAYS IN THE FORE WHEN ANY ADVENTURE OF A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS NATURE WAS UNDERTAKEN
AND THEN THE BEAM OF THE LIGHTHOUSE SHOWED THEM THE WILD ROCKS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY NOTHING COULD SAVE THEM FROM DESTRUCTION WITH A CRASH THE STEAMER DROVE ON THE HARCARS ROCKS
THE BRAVEST OF ALL WAS PERFORMED BY A GIRL WHOSE NAME WAS GRACE DARLING A NAME THAT NOW IS KNOWN NOT ONLY IN THE PLACES WHERE SHE LIVED BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD GRACE HORSLEY DARLING
HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN A HERO AT ALL WHILE THE GREAT SCOTTISH CHIEF WALLACE WAS WAGING BITTER WAR AGAINST KING EDWARD BRUCE WAS CONTENT TO REST UNDER EDWARD'S PROTECTION
WHEN THE ENGLISH HAD CONSENTED TO THESE TERMS AND AFTER THE SPANISH ADMIRAL HAD ENTERTAINED THE ENGLISH OFFICERS IN HIS OWN CABIN THE SPANIARDS TREACHEROUSLY ATTACKED THE ENGLISH KILLING A NUMBER THAT HAD GONE ASHORE BEFORE THEY COULD REGAIN THEIR BOATS
THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEMMED IN WITH THE RESTRICTIONS OF ROYALTY WHEN ALBERT WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD HIS BROTHER BALDWIN DIED AND IT WAS THEN SEEN THAT HE MIGHT INDEED BECOME KING FOR LEOPOLD HAD NO DIRECT MALE HEIRS
PEACE TERMS WERE DRAWN UP AND THE GERMANS COMPELLED TO REPAY THE BELGIANS TO THE LAST PENNY FOR THE HAVOC AND VANDALISM THEY HAD WROUGHT AND IT IS A KIND OF POETIC JUSTICE THAT ALBERT WAS REIGNING WHILE THE KAISER FLED FROM HIS OWN COUNTRY
THE REST CLUNG TO WHAT SUPPORTS THEY COULD FIND AND HELD ON EXPECTING INSTANT DEATH A WAVE LARGER THAN THE REST PICKED UP THE FORFARSHIRE BODILY AND DROVE IT DOWN AGAIN UPON THE ROCKS
IF IT WOULD BE HIS PLEASURE FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND ENGAGE IN THE MISSIONARY WORK THAT HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR THE ELDER BROTHER
FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT BY THEIR PRAYERS AND FIRES A HOST OF DEVILS WOULD ALIGHT UPON THE ENGLISH VESSELS AND DESTROY THEM DRAKE HIMSELF WAS TOO EAGER TO CONTINUE HIS VOYAGE TO THINK OF LANDING AND POINTED HIS PROWS SOUTHWARD
AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
AS WILL BE SEEN THE ABILITY TO RISE TO HEIGHTS OF GREATNESS WHEN NECESSITY CALLED ON HER TO DO SO WHEN GRACE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY THREE A TERRIBLE STORM BURST SUDDENLY UPON THE COAST
AND HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST GENIUSES THAT HAD EVER LIVED MANY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT DANTE HAD ACTUALLY BEHELD THE SCENES THAT HE DESCRIBED WHEN THEY MET HIM ON THE STREETS THEY WOULD DRAW ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS
HE BECAME BOTH GLOOMY AND UNHAPPY HIS EXILE MOREOVER WAS A BITTER BLOW TO DANTE FOR HE HAD LOVED FLORENCE DEARLY AND COULD NOT IMAGINE MAKING HIS HOME ELSEWHERE WITH BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART
WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING SAID ABOUT IT AFTERWARD IN THE COURTS OR EMBASSIES QUEEN ELIZABETH HATED THE SPANIARDS AND WAS GLAD TO DO THEM ALL THE MISCHIEF SHE COULD BUT SHE DID NOT DARE TO GO TO WAR WITH THEM AT THAT TIME
SHE THEN RETURNED TO HER HOME AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL WHEN TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND RESOLVED TO GIVE HER LIFE TO SOME USEFUL AND BENEVOLENT OCCUPATION SHE DECIDED TO BECOME A TRAINED NURSE AND WENT TO LONDON TO STUDY THAT CALLING
ROBIN STEPPED BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND GROOM AND DECLARED THAT THE CEREMONY COULD NOT CONTINUE
WILD AND SAVAGE THAT NO MORTAL EYES HAD EVER SEEN ITS EQUAL AND EVEN TO THINK OF IT AFTERWARD CAUSED HIM A BITTERNESS NOT FAR FROM THAT OF DEATH ITSELF AS HE STOOD THERE HE WAS AWARE OF A PRESENCE CLOSE BY
AND HER BRAVERY AT TIMES THIS INDOMITABLE WOMAN WAS ON HER FEET FOR TWENTY HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR SUPERVISING DIRECTING
THAT A GASP OF AMAZEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEN THAT SAW HER FOR MANY WEARY HOURS SHE TOILED AT THE GUN UNTIL THE BRITISH WERE DRIVEN BACK
AND HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE POEM AS THOUGH THE ADVENTURES IN IT WERE REAL AND HAD HAPPENED DIRECTLY TO HIMSELF HELL ACCORDING TO DANTE'S BELIEF
AND WHEN SHE GREW OLDER TO SIT UP WITH AND CHEER THE SICK AMONG THE COTTAGERS THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE EVEN AMONG THOSE WHO WERE FAR OLDER THAN HERSELF WHO COULD MINISTER TO THE SICK WITH HER KINDNESS AND SKILL
FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
AT LAST HOWEVER THE PEOPLE OF MECCA BECAME BOLD ENOUGH TO GO TO MOHAMMED'S UNCLE AND TELL HIM THAT MOHAMMED MUST CEASE PREACHING AGAINST THEIR IDOLS MOHAMMED HOWEVER INDIGNANTLY REFUSED AND WENT ON PREACHING AND HIS UNCLE CONTINUED TO PROTECT HIM
DANTE HIMSELF HOWEVER DISLIKED THIS CIVIL STRIFE AND DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO BRING THE OPPOSING FACTIONS TOGETHER BUT HIS ENEMIES GOT THE UPPER HAND
THE ALLIED ARMIES SWEPT ONWARD AND THE GERMANS RETREATED PELL MELL TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM UTTER RUIN BACK FROM THE RUINED VILLAGES AND THE OPPRESSED AND TORTURED COUNTRYSIDE THE GERMAN HORDES RETREATED AND KING ALBERT AND QUEEN ELIZABETH TRIUMPHANTLY TOOK POSSESSION ONCE MORE
IT WAS ON DRAKE'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE WEST INDIES THAT HE CONCEIVED A HATRED FOR THE SPANIARDS THAT WAS TO LAST ALL HIS LIFE AS THE RESULT OF THE BLACK TREACHERY THEY PLAYED ON HAWKINS
BRUCE HAD A COMPANION AT HIS SIDE BUT BOTH WERE WORN OUT BY THE HARDSHIPS THEY HAD UNDERGONE AND WERE FAST ASLEEP AS THE RUFFIANS WITH DRAWN SWORDS AND DAGGERS STOLE UPON THEM THE GOOD ANGEL OF SCOTLAND MADE ONE OF THEM TREAD TOO HEAVILY
DOUBLY STUNNED FROM THE FORCE WITH WHICH HE HAD HIT THE EARTH THE OUTLAWS WERE AMAZED WHEN THEY SAW WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEIR LEADER STILL MORE SO WHEN A BAND OF THE KING'S HORSEMEN RODE UP AND SURROUNDED THEM AND CALLED THE MONK WHO HAD SO LATELY BEEN FEASTING WITH THEM YOUR MAJESTY THEN RICHARD TOOK OFF HIS MONK'S DRESS
HERE COMES MOLLY WITH HER PITCHER AND GRADUALLY THIS WAS CHANGED TO HERE COMES MOLLY PITCHER AND THIS WAS THE NAME THAT HISTORY HAS ADOPTED IN REGARD TO THE BRAVE WOMAN FOR WHOM IT WAS SO USED
THE SON OF ALIGHIERO A FLORENTINE WHO WAS POPULAR AND WELL KNOWN AS A MAN OF AFFAIRS WHEN DANTE WAS BORN ITALY WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS TO DAY FOR INSTEAD OF BEING FORMED OF A SINGLE NATION
AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WERE ALIVE OR DEAD ONE DAY A MESSENGER CALLED FOR HER AT THE IRVING HOUSEHOLD HE HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN HAYS FOR MOLLY AND IT NOT ONLY TOLD HER THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND WELL BUT WAS IN CAMP NOT FAR OFF FROM HER FORMER HOME
UNABLE TO SPEAK ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROAR OF THE SEA AND WIND AND BLINDED BY THE SPRAY THAT WHIRLED OVER THEM THEIR BOAT WAS TOSSED LIKE A SHUTTLECOCK IN THE GREAT WAVES AND THEY KNEW THAT UNLESS THE SHIPWRECKED PERSONS COULD AID THEM
THE ENGLISH STRONGHOLDS IN SCOTLAND WERE OVERTHROWN AND SCOTLAND BECAME A KINGDOM IN FACT AS WELL AS IN NAME MOREOVER BRUCE'S WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN ENGLAND WERE SET AT LIBERTY
WAS A VERSE THAT TOLD DANTE THAT HERE WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE LOWER WORLD THE GATEWAY TO HELL AND THE VERSE CONCLUDED WITH THE GRIM WORDS ALL HOPE
DESERTED BY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES LIVING IN WRETCHEDNESS AND DESOLATION
RETURNING TO HER DUTIES JUST IN TIME TO HEAR GENERAL KNOX GIVE ORDERS THAT THE CANNON BE REMOVED BECAUSE HE HAD NO OTHER GUNNER COOL ENOUGH AND SKILFUL ENOUGH TO WORK IT IN ITS PRESENT EXPOSED POSITION AT THIS MOLLY SPRANG FORWARD CRYING OUT
JOHN HAYS WAS ONE OF THE CANNONEERS OF GREENE'S ARTILLERY AND HE WORKED ALL DAY LOADING AND FIRING HIS PIECE IT WAS A TERRIBLY HOT DAY AND MANY MEN IN BOTH THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICAN ARMIES FELL EXHAUSTED
FOR HIS STATE WAS NOW SO DANGEROUS AND THE HARDSHIPS HE ENDURED SO GREAT THAT NO WOMAN COULD WITHSTAND THEM AND THE LORDS WHO REMAINED IN HIS COMPANY HAD LIKEWISE TO SAY FAREWELL TO THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
SIR FRANCIS DRAKE PROBABLY THE GREATEST HERO IN ALL GREAT BRITAIN'S NAVAL HISTORY IS SIR FRANCIS DRAKE WHO CARRIED ENGLAND'S FLAG TO THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH AND MADE IT GLORIOUS WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS ON THE ENGLISH THRONE
BUT AFTER CONSULTING TOGETHER OVER THEIR BITTER FORTUNES THEY DECIDED TO MAKE A BOLD STROKE FOR SUCCESS AND DIE IF IT DID NOT SUCCEED AN ENGLISH GARRISON LAY AT TURNBERRY CASTLE NOT FAR OFF AND HAD BEEN DIVIDED IN TWO PARTS
HE HAD WON HER HAND WITH DIFFICULTY FOR MOLLY WAS A BELLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE SHE WAS NOT ONLY HANDSOME BUT AS STRONG AS A MAN ABLE TO CARRY A HEAVY MEAL SACK ON HER SHOULDER AND ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKERS THAT THE TOWN KNEW
THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MIGHT BECOME KING HAD EFFECTED A CHANGE IN THE YOUNG MAN'S CHARACTER WHO BECAME MORE RESERVED AND SERIOUS ARDENTLY DEVOTED TO HIS STUDIES AND EAGER TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE
AND MOHAMMED ALSO BELIEVED THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO TEACH HIS RELIGION BY THE SWORD IN THIS HOWEVER MOHAMMED'S FOLLOWERS BECAME MORE ZEALOUS THAN HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF BEING
KING ALBERT'S EFFORTS IN BEHALF OF THE BELGIAN ARMY WERE TOO LATE ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FOURTEEN ALBERT WENT TO SWITZERLAND ON A VACATION
WHEN HER DEATH BECAME KNOWN THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED IN ENGLAND THIS MURDER DID MORE TO STIMULATE RECRUITING THAN ANYTHING ELSE UP TO THAT TIME ALL DAY LONG LINES OF MEN WAITED TO SIGN THE PAPERS OF ENLISTMENT
AND WITH NEW HANDS AT THE OARS THE BOAT WAS ROWED BACK TO THE LIGHTHOUSE A TRIP THAT REQUIRED GREAT STRENGTH AND MUCH TIME FOR THE CURRENT WAS AGAINST THEM AND WHEN THE LIGHT WAS REACHED
RETURNED TO ENGLAND WHERE THE TWO GIRLS SPENT THEIR CHILDHOOD IN A RAMBLING OLD HOUSE IN DERBYSHIRE WITH MANY TRADITIONS AND STORIES ATTACHED TO IT HERE FLORENCE CONCEIVED A LOVE FOR NURSING AND USED TO TEND SICK ANIMALS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY THINGS IN MOHAMMED'S RELIGION THAT ANY ONE WOULD DO WELL TO FOLLOW FOR HE PREACHED THAT GOD WAS MERCIFUL AND HIS PEOPLE ON EARTH MUST BE MERCIFUL ALSO THAT CLEANLINESS WAS NEXT TO GODLINESS
SHE WASHED AND SCRUBBED AND SCOURED AND BAKED FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND SEEMED TO REVEL IN THE HARD WORK THAT GAVE THE NEEDED EXERCISE TO HER STRONG MUSCLES THROUGHOUT HER LIFE MOLLY HAYS HAD ADMIRED SOLDIERS
AND ONE AND ALL THEY HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE NEUTRALITY OF THIS LITTLE STATE WITH FORCE OF ARMS IF NECESSARY THIS AS WE HAVE SAID HAD GIVEN THE BELGIANS A FEELING OF SECURITY THEY BELIEVED THAT EVEN IF WAR BROKE OUT
BUT MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES AS THEY WERE AND THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM TO BUILD BETTER HOUSES AND BRING TO THEM THE COMFORTS THAT THEY NEEDED AND AT ONCE HE BUSIED HIMSELF GETTING BUILDING MATERIALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITH WHICH TRIM COTTAGES WERE BUILT
WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER NAMED WILLIAM DARLING WHO TENDED A LIGHT ON ONE OF THE FARNE ISLANDS AS HIS FATHER HAD DONE BEFORE HIM GRACE WHO WAS THE SEVENTH OF NINE CHILDREN
SHE BELIEVED THAT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH AND LOOKED UPON HIM AS SOME ONE WHO THROUGH GOD'S MEANS HAD BECOME MORE THAN A MAN
HE WENT TO GERMANY TO SEE THE CLINIC OF A BAVARIAN DUKE NAMED CHARLES THEODORE WHOSE SKILL AS AN OCCULIST HAD MADE HIM FAMOUS THROUGHOUT EUROPE ALBERT VISITED THIS DUKE AND WAS PRESENTED TO HIS DAUGHTERS WITH ONE OF WHOM THE DUCHESS ELIZABETH
BUT DRAKE FEARED THAT THE QUEEN WOULD NOT APPROVE OF THE IDEA AND FOR A TIME CHERISHED IT ONLY IN HIS OWN MIND WAITING A MORE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO LAY IT BEFORE THE QUEEN IN THE MEANTIME
THAT I AM HE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK AND HAVE RETURNED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO RESUME MY CROWN AND THRONE WHEN THE OLD WOMAN RECOVERED FROM HER AMAZEMENT SHE DID HIM REVERENCE AS THE RIGHTFUL KING OF SCOTLAND
THE ENGLISH HAD NOT RECKONED ON SUCH STUBBORN RESISTANCE FROM A FORCE FAR INFERIOR TO THEIR OWN BOTH IN SIZE AND EQUIPMENT AND AS THE DAY WAS WANING THEY WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER PLANNING TO HOLD A COUNCIL OF WAR AND GAIN THE BATTLE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
IT SEEMED THAT SHE COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS BRUCE GRADUALLY WASTED AWAY AND DIED IN THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE HIS NOBLE FOLLOWER DOUGLAS WHO HAD WON THE NAME FROM THE ENGLISH OF THE BLACK DOUGLAS
BUT DARLING BRAVE SAILOR AS HE WAS KNEW THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO CHANCE OF HIS EVER REACHING THE DOOMED SHIP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD THEN GRACE BEGAN TO PLEAD WITH HER FATHER
SO ALBERT STRUGGLED TO INCREASE THE ARMY AND SECURED THE PASSAGE OF A FAVORABLE BILL IN OCTOBER NINETEEN THIRTEEN BUT THE IRON FORCES OF GERMANY WERE FORGED AND READY
AND AFTER FATHER DAMIEN HAD BEEN TEN YEARS ON MOLOKAI HE FOUND HIMSELF A VICTIM OF THE SCOURGE AGAINST WHICH HE HAD SO BRAVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY CONTENDED A VISIT TO THE RESIDENT DOCTOR CONFIRMED THE WORST OF HIS FEARS
HIS NAME IS AS BRIGHT IN SCOTLAND AS THOUGH HE HAD LIVED YESTERDAY SONGS AND STORIES ARE TOLD ABOUT HIM THERE AND EVERY SCHOOL BOY HEARS OF HIM AS SOON AS HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO THE TALES OF HIS COUNTRY
BESIDE HIS OWN IN SPITE OF HIS LOVE DANTE DID NOT BECOME AN IDLE DREAMER BUT DEVELOPED INTO AN ACTIVE AND STUDIOUS YOUNG MAN READY TO TAKE UP THE SWORD TO DEFEND HIS CITY WHENEVER IT MIGHT CALL ON HIM TO DO SO
BUT THE STRANGER STRUCK WITH SUCH FORCE THAT NOBODY COULD STAND UP TO HIM AND ALTHOUGH ROBIN PUT UP A LONG AND FURIOUS FIGHT
ON ANOTHER OCCASION ROBIN AND HIS BAND MARRIED TWO LOVERS WHO HAD BEEN FORCED TO PART BECAUSE THE MAIDEN'S FATHER HAD DETERMINED THAT SHE WAS TO BECOME THE BRIDE OF A WICKED BUT WEALTHY OLD NOBLEMAN THE OUTLAWS SURROUNDED THE CHAPEL IN WHICH THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHEN THE CEREMONY WAS BEGUN
WHAT HE NOW PLANNED WAS ENTIRELY NEW AND SO DARING THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN THOUGHT OF SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD HE PLANNED IN THIS POEM TO DESCRIBE A JOURNEY INTO THE NETHERMOST REGIONS OF HELL THEN INTO PURGATORY
FOOD THAT WOULD SAVE THEIR LIVES THE DEATH RATE WE ARE TOLD BEFORE THIS WOMAN NURSE AND HER LITTLE COMPANY ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL WAS SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL THE CASES THAT WERE TREATED THERE AND AFTER SHE HAD EFFECTED THE CHANGES THAT SHE SAW WERE NECESSARY
AND THAT ALL HIS FOLLOWERS MUST WASH THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY PRAYED IN MANY WAYS HOWEVER THE MOHAMMEDAN FAITH WAS NOT SO PURE AS THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FOR THE HEAVEN THAT MOHAMMED BELIEVED IN WAS A PLACE OF FEASTING AND MERRIMENT BUT LITTLE ELSE
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
THE KING MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE PUBLICLY CONFIRMED ALBERT'S CLAIM TO THE THRONE AND PUBLIC ATTENTION WAS NOW FOCUSSED ON THE PRINCE WHO WAS TO BE KING ALBERT HAD NO INTENTION OF MEDDLING WITH POLITICAL AFFAIRS UNTIL HE ACTUALLY SHOULD BECOME THE RULER OF BELGIUM
IT WAS HARD TO GET THE NEWSPAPERS IN THOSE TIMES AND NEWS OF THE ARMIES AND THEIR DOINGS WAS OFTEN WEEKS BEHIND THE ACTUAL EVENTS MOLLY HOPED AND WAITED BUT FOR WEEKS AT A TIME SHE WENT WITHOUT WORD FROM HER HUSBAND
WHERE HE SAW PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF MECCA AND LEARNED OF MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF RELIGION WHEN MOHAMMED WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THERE BEFELL A CHANGE IN HIS FORTUNES IN THIS YEAR HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A RICH WIDOW WHOSE NAME WAS KADIJAH
AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
A FAR GREATER ADVENTURE LAY BEFORE HER FOR SHE FELL IN WITH THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS JUST AS THEY COMMENCED THE SEVERE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH THIS BATTLE HAD CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE AS A COMPARATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF TROOPS WERE ENGAGED IN IT
THAT COMYN MUST BE SLAIN HE SENT HIS TWO BROTHERS AS MESSENGERS TO COMYN ASKING THIS LORD TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO A CHURCH IN DUMFRIES WHERE BRUCE WAS WAITING FOR HIM AT THE ALTAR
SHE PUTS HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES NO
ENQUIRE GENIALLY WHAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD DIED OF AND SHOW ME TO THE DOOR THIS IDEA OF MINE WAS FOSTERED BY THE EXCELLENT TESTIMONIAL WHICH I HAD WRITTEN MYSELF AT THE COMPANY'S BIDDING
BUT WHETHER YOU PARDON ME OR NOT I ASK YOU TO LISTEN TO ME I KNOW OF NO WOMAN FOR WHOSE TALENTS I HAVE A GREATER ADMIRATION
AN INSURANCE ACT
MY REPLIES HAD BEEN A MODEL OF WHAT AN ASSURANCE COMPANY EXPECTS THEN WHY THE NEED OF A DOCTOR
IF YOU'LL WAIT A MOMENT WHILE I SHARPEN THE KNIFE LET'S SEE YOU LIKE IT CUT ON THE CROSS I THINK BOTHER THEY'VE FORGOTTEN THE STROP WELL IT MAY NOT BE A BUTCHER
TO PROTECT HER FROM THE CRUEL WORLD
GOT SOMEBODY WHO HAD BLACK HAIR
DOES IT MATTER WHERE I HIT THE RED NOT MUCH AS LONG AS YOU HIT IT ON THE RED PART SHE HIT IT HARD ON THE SIDE AND BOTH BALLS CAME INTO BAULK TOO GOOD I SAID
OH I THOUGHT YOU DINED AT IT
DO YOU MEAN MY RIGHT HAND SIDE OR THE BALL'S THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE BALL OF COURSE THAT IS TO SAY THE SIDE OPPOSITE YOUR RIGHT HAND BUT
I PROTESTED IT'S SOMETHING TO HAVE BEEN MEASURED FOR THE WIG HAVE YOU BEEN MEASURED FOR YOUR WIG
AND WITH YOUR HANDS GRASPING THE ELASTIC CORDS HELD STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR THE TENSION ON YOUR WAIST IS THEN EXTREME BUT ON YOUR HANDS ONLY MODERATE THEN TAKING A DEEP BREATH
IT WAS A TIN PLATE BEARING THE WORD LADIES
THE SOCK HOWEVER HAS NO REAL BEARING UPON THE PLOT
ONCE UPON A TIME I LOST MY RETURN TICKET AND I HAD TO PAY TWO POUNDS FOR ANOTHER AND A MONTH AFTERWARDS I MET A MAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT TICKETS AND HE SAID YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE MONEY BACK IF YOU HAD APPLIED AT ONCE SO I SAID
MY CHEST
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HE SAID IS TO TAKE A TICKET TO THE NEXT STATION AND TALK TO THEM THERE THIS IS ONLY A BRANCH LINE AND I HAVE NO POWER TO GIVE YOU A PASS SO THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO DO
BUT I ENQUIRED ABOUT HIM AFTERWARDS AND I FIND THAT HE IS A MISTER ENTER MARY THE PARLOURMAID
OR I MIGHT HAVE LICKED HIS EAR BEYOND THAT NOTHING SEEMED TO OFFER I MOISTENED MY LIPS AND SPOKE AM I DYING I ASKED IN A BROKEN VOICE
A SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN GUESSING THAT SHE IS IN LOVE ON THE OTHER HAND HER ELDER SISTER MISS PRENDERGAST
WELL THE MONEY WOULD LAST LONGER THAT WAY BUT UNLESS I COULD OVERCOME QUICKLY THE DISTRUST WHICH I SEEMED TO INSPIRE IN STATION MASTERS THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH LEFT FOR LUNCH I GAVE THE PORTER ALL I COULD AFFORD A HA'PENNY MENTIONED APOLOGETICALLY THAT I WAS COMING BACK AND STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN
AND WHEN I HAD BEEN DOING IT FOR A WEEK I DISCOVERED WHAT ITS PARTICULAR OBJECT WAS WHAT
I'VE JUST BEEN ORDERING THAT IS TO SAY
MY BALL AVOIDED THE RED AND CAME SWIFTLY BACK INTO THE LEFT HAND BOTTOM POCKET THAT'S THREE TO YOU I SAID WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM CELIA SEEMED SURPRISED
FOR AT THE NEXT KNOCK HE PASSED ON TO AN ADJACENT SPOT
SELECT A CUE SHE WENT OVER TO THE RACK AND INSPECTED THEM THIS SEEMS A NICE BROWN ONE NOW THEN YOU BEGIN CELIA YOU'VE GOT THE HALF BUTT
WHY WAS IT EVEN MORE UNSUITABLE THAN THE OTHER TWO I FOUND WHEN I HAD DONE IT SIX TIMES
AT THAT MOMENT A PORTER CAME UP DID YOU GIVE UP YOUR TICKET SIR HE ASKED HERBERT I HADN'T TIME TO GET ONE SAID HERBERT QUITE AT HIS EASE I'LL PAY NOW AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIS POCKETS THE TRAIN MOVED OUT OF THE STATION
AT LAST I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU IN HAND WILL YOU TRUST YOURSELF ENTIRELY TO ME TO THE DEATH YOUR MAJESTY I'M SICKENING FOR SOMETHING AS IT IS HOW TALL ARE YOU
AND GAVE IT PLENTY THEN I LET FLY WHY DID THAT WANT A LOT OF CHALK SAID CELIA WITH INTEREST I WENT TO THE FIREPLACE AND PICKED MY BALL OUT OF THE FENDER
WHAT OFFICIALLY YOU DO THEN I CANNOT SAY SOME PEOPLE CAN STAND EASILY UPON THE RIGHT FOOT WHEN THE LEFT IS FASTENED TO THE WALL
BY AND BY HE WENT AND LISTENED BEHIND MY BACK IT IS VERY BAD FORM TO LISTEN BEHIND A PERSON'S BACK I DID NOT TELL HIM SO HOWEVER I WANTED HIM TO LIKE ME YES
I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY BECOMING FIGURE BUT YOU DON'T WEAR FANCY DRESS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING WELL THAT IS RATHER THE POINT TO SETTLE
SIMPLY COULDN'T LOOK A POACHED IN THE YOLK A DAY ON THE SOFA IN A DARKENED ROOM AND BED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WAS MY PROGRAMME AND THEN MY EYE
I DID THIS ONCE BY ACCIDENT AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT AGAIN OR PERHAPS I CORRECTED MYSELF AS SOON AS THE BALL HAD LEFT ME I HAD BETTER GIVE A SAFETY MISS I DID
THIS STATION MASTER WAS EVEN MORE UNEMOTIONAL THAN THE LAST HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO COULD VOUCH FOR ME I MENTIONED HERBERT DIFFIDENTLY HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HERBERT I SHOWED HIM MY GOLD WATCH MY SILVER CIGARETTE CASE
I'VE GOT AN AWFUL COLD
YOU PULL YOUR ARMS SLOWLY OUT UNTIL THEY LIE ALONG THE FLOOR THE TENSION BECOMES TERRIFIC THE STRAIN ON EVERY PART OF YOU IS IMMENSE
SOMEHOW I FELT INSTINCTIVELY
I SAY WHERE DO I GET A WIG YOU'VE DONE NOTHING SAID ELIZABETH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I SAY DON'T SAY THAT
I KNOW MY LITTLE SISTER YOU SEE BOOTLE TACTLESSLY
I REFLECTED THERE IS A LIMIT OF BEAUTY BEYOND WHICH IT IS DANGEROUS TO GO AFTER THAT
I ALWAYS THINK THAT THESE GREAT SCIENTISTS I SHOULD SAY PHILOS
WHILE I LAY THERE TAKING A DEEP BREATH BEFORE RELAXING I SAID TO MYSELF THE STRAIN WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR ME I WAS WRONG IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE HOOK THE HOOK
IT WAS NO GOOD HE WAS EVIDENTLY DETERMINED TO SEE MY CHEST
BEING SIMPLY AS TACTFUL AS YOU CAN BE AND GRACEFUL IT ISN'T AS THOUGH YOU WERE ACTUALLY A RELATION I PROTESTED ADELA CONTINUED FULL OF HER IDEA
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT GETTING UP WHEN HE CAME INTO MY ROOM HE LOOKED AT ME IN HORROR MY DEAR FELLOW HE SAID AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PACKED YOU'LL BE LATE HERE GET UP AND I'LL PACK FOR YOU WHILE YOU DRESS DO I SAID BRIEFLY FIRST OF ALL WHAT CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRAVEL IN
I CROSSED MY KNEES
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE CHART THAT WENT WITH IT NOT WELL EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT EACH EXERCISE WAS ARRANGED FOR A PARTICULAR OBJECT ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU WANTED
THAT IS TO SAY THEY WERE SITTING ROUND THE FIRE AND SAYING TO EACH OTHER THIS IS A ROTTEN PLAY WE HAD BEEN OFFERED THE POSITION OF AUDITORS TO SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY BUT WE WERE GOING TO SEE PARSIFAL ON THE NEXT DAY
BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO KNOCK THE RED IN FOR GAME OH THERE WHAT'S THAT THAT'S A MISCUE I GET ONE OH OH WELL
BUS I'VE GOT A COLD I MUSTN'T KEEP IT WAITING GOOD BYE AND I FLED I AM GOING I SAID
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS TOO LATE NO UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T HE GOT THE TWO POUNDS THE MOST EXPENSIVE CIGARETTE I'VE EVER SMOKED WELL THAT JUST SHOWS YOU SAID HERBERT HERE'S YOUR TICKET PUT IT IN YOUR WAISTCOAT POCKET NOW
AND DON'T DO ALL THE EXERCISES TO BEGIN WITH START WITH THREE OR FOUR OF THE EASY ONES OF COURSE I SAID I UNDID THE WRAPPINGS EAGERLY TOOK OFF THE LID OF THE BOX
SAID ELIZABETH IT DEPENDS WHAT THEY'VE GOT THAT WAS A WEEK AGO THIS MORNING I WAS REALLY ILL AT LAST
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO UNSETTLE ME AND I WAS GOING TO MORROW TO ORDER THE CLOTHES
FOR THE MOST PART ONE DOUBLE KNOCK AT ANY POINT APPEARED TO SATISFY HIM BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER AND HE WOULD KNOCK AGAIN AT ONE SPOT HE KNOCKED FOUR TIMES BEFORE HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF HEARD
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A WAISTCOAT ON SILLY WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ON I DON'T KNOW YET THIS IS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRES THOUGHT GIVE ME TIME GIVE ME AIR
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND THE TRAP STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR HELP I CRIED AND I LEAPT OUT OF BED HALF AN HOUR LATER I WAS SAYING GOOD BYE TO HERBERT I'VE HAD AN AWFULLY JOLLY TIME I SAID AND I'LL COME AGAIN YOU'VE GOT THE TICKET ALL RIGHT RATHER
EVERYTHING FLEW AT ME AT ONCE AND I REMEMBERED NO MORE AS I LIMPED INTO BED I TROD HEAVILY UPON SOMETHING SHARP I SHRIEKED AND BENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT HAD BITTEN ME
QUEEN ELIZABETH REGARDED ME AS STERNLY AS SHE MIGHT HAVE REGARDED WELL I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT HISTORY
COMING TO REST NEAR THE TOP RIGHT HAND POCKET AND CLOSE TO THE CUSHION WITH A FORCING SHOT I COULD GET IN THIS WILL WANT A LOT OF CHALK I SAID PLEASANTLY TO CELIA
NOW THAT WOULD BE AN ORIGINAL COSTUME I SHOULD HAVE DON'T BE RIDICULOUS
WHAT WAS YOUR MAN'S NAME
WELL WE NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT I'VE LEFT IT AT HOME HE DIDN'T SEEM INTENSELY EXCITED WHAT DID YOU THINK OF DOING HE ASKED I HAD RATHER HOPED THAT YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY ANOTHER TICKET AND GET THE MONEY BACK AFTERWARDS
ARE YOU SUFFERING FROM ANY CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE NO HAVE YOU EVER HAD GOUT NO ARE YOU DEFORMED NO ARE YOU OF STRICTLY SOBER AND TEMPERATE HABITS
BUT WELL THE FACT IS
SHE SAID AT LAST

WOULD YOU PROMISE ME TO USE IT EVERY DAY IF I SENT YOU MINE WHY DON'T YOU WANT YOURS ANY MORE ARE YOU PERFECT NOW
AND I DROVE AWAY AMIDST CHEERS CHEERS OF SORROW IT WAS HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE TO THE STATION
THEY INSISTED THE DOCTOR BEGAN QUIETLY ENOUGH HE ASKED AS I HAD ANTICIPATED AFTER THE HEALTH OF MY RELATIONS
AN EXTRA PIECE OF ELASTIC WHICH HAD GOT HITCHED SOMEWHERE CAME SUDDENLY INTO PLAY AND I DID THE REST OF THE JOURNEY WITHOUT A STOP FINISHING UP SHARPLY AGAINST THE TOWEL HORSE THE CHART HAD SAID
BECAUSE I WENT DOWN BY MISTAKE BUT YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU GOT GOING YOU WANTED I CAN'T ARGUE BENDING DOWN LIKE THIS SHE RAISED HERSELF SLOWLY
JUST BREATHE NATURALLY I AM

JANE BRIGHTENING UP SUCH AN INTERESTING MAN MY DEAR HE TALKED MOST AGREEABLY ABOUT ART DURING DINNER AND WE RENEWED THE CONVERSATION IN THE DRAWING ROOM WE FOUND THAT WE AGREED UPON ALL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF ART CONSIDERED AS SUCH
AND HE GOT UP FROM THE DESK WHERE HE HAD BEEN MAKING NOTES OF MY DISASTROUS CASE AND CAME OVER TO ME THERE IS JUST ONE THING MORE SIT DOWN I SAT DOWN NOW CROSS YOUR KNEES
IF THE BALL IS FACING THIS WAY TAKE IT I SAID WEARILY THAT THE BALL HAS ITS BACK TO YOU HOW RUDE OF IT SAID CELIA

BECAUSE ONCE WHEN SIR EDWARD GREY WAS PLAYING THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR BUT IT'S RATHER A LONG STORY I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER TIME OH WELL ANYHOW DID THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR GET ANYTHING FOR IT NO
IT HELPS THE CIRCULATION MY OWN IDEA BUT IT LOOKS SO BAD YOU OUGHT DON'T IMPROVE ME I BEGGED NO WONDER YOU HAVE HUSH I HAVEN'T

I SAID SUSPICIOUSLY BUT THEY ARE SUCH GOOD THINGS WENT ON ADELA EARNESTLY
SHE CHALKED HER CUE AND WENT OVER TO HER BALL WHAT SHALL I DO JUST TOUCH THE RED ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE I SAID AND YOU'LL GO INTO THE POCKET THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
BUNNY CRIED HENRIETTE WITH A SILVERY RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER DO BE CAREFUL AN EPIGRAM FROM YOU MY DEAR BOY YOU'LL BE DOWN WITH BRAIN FEVER IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT HUMPH SAID I WITH A SHRUG OF MY SHOULDERS
MISSUS VAN RAFFLES WENT TO NEW YORK WEDNESDAY EVENING SAID I AND HAS NOT YET RETURNED I AM EXPECTING HER EVERY MINUTE MADAME SHE MUST BE HERE FOR THE MUSICALE WON'T YOU WAIT
THEN WHAT SHALL WE DO BUNNY DEMANDED MISSUS VAN RAFFLES I MUST HAVE THAT TIARA WELL
THE SHADD MUSICALE FOR THAT EVENING WOULD BE HELD AT BOLIVAR LODGE INSTEAD OF IN THE ONYX HOUSE BALLROOM FRIDAY AFTERNOON JOCKOBINSKI'S PRIVATE AND PARTICULAR PIANO ARRIVED AT THE LODGE AND WAS SET UP PROMPTLY IN THE MUSIC ROOM
A MARVELLOUS COLLECTION THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART WHOLLY UNCUT EVERYTHING MOVED ALONG SERENELY UNTIL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE IN THE CELLAR
THERE NEVER WERE SUCH PANCAKES SUCH PUREES SUCH MADE DISHES AS THAT WOMAN GETS UP SHE TURNS HASH INTO A CONFECTION AND LIVER AND BACON INTO A DELICACY
AND OH HOW I REVELLED IN IT THE BEAUTIES OF BOLIVAR LODGE HAD NEVER SO REVEALED THEMSELVES TO ME AS THEN THE HOUSE AS DARK AS THE TOMB WITHOUT
A BIG FELLOW SHE GRINNED WITH A QUEER SMILE OH ABOUT YOUR HEIGHT SAID I WELL
I'M GOING TO MISSUS INNITT'S TO DINNER TO MORROW NIGHT SO LOOK OUT FOR NORAH BY MONDAY I TURNED SULKILY AWAY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ON THAT SUBJECT SAID I THIS BUSINESS OF GOING INTO ANOTHER PERSON'S HOUSE AS A GUEST
WHICH BY CHANCE SHE LEFT UNSEALED SO THAT ON MY WAY BACK BELOW STAIRS I WAS ABLE TO READ IT WHAT IT SAID WAS THAT SHE WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO OBLIGE MISSUS SHADD AND WAS VERY SORRY INDEED TO HEAR THAT HER SON HAD BEEN INJURED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
AND I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT AT LAST HENRIETTE HAD REACHED THE END OF HER INGENUITY THOUGH FOR MY OWN PART I COULD NOT BLAME HER IF SHE FAILED TO FIND SOME PLAUSIBLE WAY OUT OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT CAME AND CONSUMED BY CURIOSITY TO LEARN JUST HOW THE MATTER STOOD
WELL I THINK THIS IS THE CLEVEREST TRICK YOU'VE TURNED YET HENRIETTE SAID I
I HAD QUITE SET MY HEART ON HAVING JOCKOBINSKI HERE NOT THAT I CARE PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE MUSIC END OF IT BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THAT GIVES A WOMAN SO ASSURED A SOCIAL POSITION AS BEING THE HOSTESS OF AN ANIMAL OF HIS PARTICULAR KIND
AT ANY RATE ONE MORNING IN MID AUGUST WHEN THE NEWPORT SEASON WAS IN FULL FEATHER
AS YOU MUST BY THIS TIME HAVE REALIZED YOURSELF THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD THAT I COULD POSSIBLY BRING MYSELF TO THINK FONDLY OF AND THAT WOMAN WAS NONE OTHER THAN HENRIETTE HERSELF I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOWEVER
HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH REAL PLEASURE WELL MISTER HIGGINBOTHAM I GUESS I GUESS I'LL DO IT I CAN'T BE OUTDONE IN GENEROSITY BY YOU SIR AND ER
FROM VARIOUS TRADESMEN OF THE TOWN I RECEIVED PRESENTS OF NO LITTLE VALUE IN THE FORM SOMETIMES OF DIAMOND SCARF PINS GOLD LINK SLEEVE BUTTONS CASES OF FINE WINES FOR MY OWN USE AND IN ONE OR TWO INSTANCES CHECKS OF SUBSTANTIAL VALUE
MAYBE IN YOUR OLD AGE YOU'LL BE BACK IN DEAR OLD LONDON CONTRIBUTING TO PUNCH IF YOU ARE CAREFUL OF YOUR WITS BUT HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THE OLIVER SLOSHINGTONS EVER GOT IN HERE HE HOLDS THE DIVORCE RECORD I BELIEVE SAID I HE'S BEEN MARRIED TO FOUR SOCIAL LEADERS ALREADY HASN'T HE
TRUE I DID NOT GO DOWN TO SEE IF ANY ONE WERE THERE
A ROPE WALK WON'T BE IN IT WITH HER
THE GASTERS OF COURSE BELONG AT THE TOP BY PATENT RIGHT HAVING INVENTED AMERICAN SOCIETY OR AT LEAST THE MACHINE THAT AT PRESENT CONTROLS IT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO ALL THE ROYALTIES IT BRINGS IN THE ROCKERBILTS GOT THERE ALL OF A SUDDEN BY THE SHEER LAVISHNESS OF THEIR ENTERTAINMENT
BUT I THINK IT IS PRETTY GOOD I MANAGED TO RAISE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT BY THE USE OF IT LAST NIGHT INDEED SAID HENRIETTE WITH A SLIGHT FROWN HOW BUNNY YOU KNOW YOU ARE LIKELY TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FOR ALL OF US IF YOU WORK ON THE SIDE WHAT PRAY DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL MISSUS VAN RAFFLES SHE SAID WITH A SHEEPISH SMILE COOK'S PERFECTLY SOBER IF ANYTHING OF THE KIND EVER HAPPENS AGAIN SHE SHALL GO
OF COURSE NOT SHE RESPONDED QUICKLY BUT WHAT IS TO PREVENT OUR BECOMING A MUNICIPALITY MY ANSWER WAS AN AMAZED SILENCE FOR FRANKLY I COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME GUESS HOW WE WERE TO DO ANY SUCH THING IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD SHE CONTINUED
I CAN'T BLAME YOU INDEED AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DONE I OUGHT TO BE AND REALLY AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU ONLY WHOM DID YOU HAVE AT DINNER WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEAR ASKED HENRIETTE
THREE ROLLS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS WAISTCOAT AND SUNDRY OTHER LOTS OF CURRENCY BOTH PAPER AND SPECIE THAT I FOUND STOWED AWAY IN HIS OVERCOAT AND DINNER COAT POCKETS THERE WERE ALSO TEN TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECES IN A LITTLE SILVER CHAIN BAG HE CARRIED ON HIS WRIST
THERE WERE FLOWERS EVERYWHERE AND HANGING FROM TREE TO TREE FROM ONE END OF THEIR TWENTY ACRES TO THE OTHER WERE LONG AND GRACEFUL GARLANDS OF MULTICOLORED ELECTRIC LIGHTS THAT WHEN NIGHT CAME DOWN UPON THE FETE MADE THE SCENE APPEAR LIKE A VERITABLE GLIMPSE OF FAIRYLAND
THE MOMENT CAME AND INSTANTLY AS I LEANED OVER MISSUS ROCKERBILT'S SIDE WITH THE FISH PLATTER IN MY HAND OUT WENT THE LIGHT
BUT THERE THERE BUNNY I'LL MANAGE THIS LITTLE THING MYSELF IT'S A TRIFLE TOO SUBTLE FOR A MAN'S INTELLECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MAN IS YOU
YOUR VERY WORDS MY DEAR PAULINE SAID HENRIETTE WITH AN ADMIRABLY TIMED BREAK IN HER VOICE AND I DID AND I TOLD YOU I WOULD I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON MY TRAVELLING GOWN MOTORED TO PROVIDENCE
THAT IT WAS DOING VERY WELL THE BENEFICIARIES DID VERY WELL HERE SAID HENRIETTE I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF THEM OBSERVED MISSUS GASTER WELL NO SAID HENRIETTE THE MANAGERS THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO SEND THEM HERE BEFORE THE SEASON WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
WHEN MISSUS SHADD HERSELF DROVE UP TO THE FRONT DOOR HER COLOR WAS UNUSUALLY HIGH AND HAD SHE BEEN ANY BUT A LADY OF THE GRANDE MONDE I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE WAS FLUSTERED SHE DEMANDED RATHER THAN ASKED TO SEE MY MISTRESS
SAID I FOR DIGBY HAD EXPLAINED THE SCHEME IN DETAIL TO ME YOU SEE THEIR IDEAS OF FUN ARE RATHER PRIMITIVE AND IF THEY WERE SUDDENLY INTRODUCED INTO POLITE SOCIETY WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS TRAINING
AND RAFFLED AT FIVE DOLLARS A GUESS
AND ALL THE WEALTHY FAMILIES OF NEWPORT VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING FIRST TO WELCOME HIM TO OUR SHORES NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A FREAK MIND YOU BUT FOR ART'S SWEET SAKE MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS OFFERED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM AS A WEEK END GUEST
EACH OF THE TWELVE LADY PATRONESSES HAS PROMISED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALE OF A HUNDRED TICKETS OF ADMISSION AT TEN DOLLARS APIECE THAT MAKES TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADMISSIONS IT WILL COST EACH PERSON TEN DOLLARS MORE TO GET OUT WHICH IF ONLY HALF OF THE TICKETS ARE USED WILL BE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OR
I ATTEMPTED TO SOUND HENRIETTE ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD LIKE FRIDAY EVENING OFF MISSUS VAN RAFFLES SAID I IF YOU ARE GOING TO MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE YOU WILL HAVE NO USE FOR ME SHUT UP BUNNY SHE RETURNED ABRUPTLY I SHALL NEED YOU FRIDAY NIGHT MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE JOCKOBINSKI AT BOLIVAR LODGE YET SHE MURMURED I WANT TO HAVE HIM FIRST OF COURSE OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SECOND IN DOING A THING OF THAT KIND IS WORSE THAN NEVER DOING IT AT ALL
AS I SAY THERE WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OF THIS LOOSE CHANGE AND I RECKON UP THE VALUE OF HIS STUDS GARTER RUBIES AND FINGER RINGS AT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE OR A TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PULL IN ALL EH
AND IT NEARLY CHOKED ME TO DEATH I TRIED HARD TO KEEP MISSUS INNITT FROM SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT SHE IS WATCHFUL IF NOT BRAINY AND ALL MY EFFORTS WENT FOR NAUGHT SHE WAS MUCH MORTIFIED OF COURSE AND APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY ALL WENT WELL UNTIL THE FISH
I HAD MAPPED OUT ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND CORNER LOTS ON THE THING AND THANKS TO MY KNACK AT DRAUGHTSMANSHIP
PALM BEACH EH YES SAID HENRIETTE PALM BEACH I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE AND THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
NEITHER YOU NOR MY DEAR OLD FRIEND RAFFLES EVER GAVE ME CREDIT FOR ANY BRAINS I HAVE A FEW HOWEVER WHICH I USE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS I DRAWLED WELL DON'T WASTE THEM HERE BUNNY LAUGHED HENRIETTE SAVE EM FOR SOME PLACE WHERE THEY'LL BE APPRECIATED
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BUNNY CRIED HENRIETTE WHEN I HANDED HER THE CHECK YEP SAID I WELL THAT IS A GOOD DAY'S SPORT SHE SAID GAZING AT THE SLIP TWICE AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED YES SAID I
AND LATER WHEN THE CATERERS ARRIVED WITH THE SUPPER FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED ODD GUESTS BIDDEN TO THE FEAST ALL WAS IN READINESS FOR THEM EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND ALTHOUGH HENRIETTE HAD NOT YET ARRIVED I FELT EASY AND SECURE OF MIND UNTIL NEARING FIVE THIRTY O'CLOCK
I AM GOING TO A LITTLE FANCY DRESS DANCE MISTER SIKES SHE EXPLAINED AS QUEEN CATHARINE OF RUSSIA AND THIS TIARA IS A COPY OF THE VERY FAMOUS LOST NEGLIGEE CROWN OF THAT UNHAPPY QUEEN
IT DID NOT TAKE ME MANY DAYS TO DISCOVER THAT HENRIETTE WAS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO HER LATE HUSBAND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL PROFIT ESCAPED HER EYE AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE AS TIME WENT ON AND I NOTED THE ACCUMULATION OF SPOONS FORKS NUTCRACKERS
OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSUS GASTER'S JEWELS
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT QUICK TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE DIRECTLY UNDER YOUR NOSE HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I FIRST LEARNED OF ALL THIS GRAFT AT NEWPORT WHY BY READING THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS OF THEIR JEWELS IN THE SUNDAY AND DAILY NEWSPAPERS
AND IN ORDER TO QUIET ALL SUSPICION OF MY REAL STATUS IN THE VAN RAFFLES HOUSEHOLD I WAS COMPELLED TO ACT THE PART IN A FASHION WHICH REVOLTED ME OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS PLEASANT AND
WHICH I IMMEDIATELY DELIVERED IS BUNDERBY WAITING ASKED HENRIETTE AS SHE READ THE NOTE
NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY WORN OUT
I HAVEN'T STUDIED PENMANSHIP FOR NOTHING YOU KNOW MISSUS GASTER WILL NEVER KNOW SO JUST PUT ON YOUR BOLDEST FRONT REMEMBER YOUR NAME AND DON'T FORGET TO BE MODEST ABOUT YOUR OWN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR ART GALLERY
ONLY HOWEVER TO BE FORESTALLED HERSELF OH MY DEAR PAULINE HENRIETTE CRIED
HE WAS A CLEVER RASCAL YOU SAY BUNNY SHE ASKED ONE MORNING
I REALIZED THAT AFTER ALL NOTHING COULD BE PLEASANTER THAN TO SIT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SMOKE AND QUAFF BUMPERS OF CHAMPAGNE UNTIL THE CRACK OF DOOM
WHERE I HAD LEFT OFF AT THE MOMENT OF THE INTERRUPTION THAT EVENING I COOKED MYSELF A WELSH RABBIT
I THINK THERE IS A BETTER METHOD AH I WANT YOU TO RUN DOWN TO NEW YORK FOR A FEW DAYS SHORTLY BUNNY I HAVE A LETTER I WISH YOU TO MAIL NOTHING MORE WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY
YOU KNOW MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS YES SAID I SHE IS THE LADY WHO ASKED ME FOR THE OLIVES AT YOUR LAST DINNER PRECISELY OBSERVED HENRIETTE YOU POSSIBLY OBSERVED ALSO THAT WHEREVER SHE GOES SHE WEARS ABOUT SIXTY NINE YARDS OF PEARL ROPE UPON HER PERSON
WHEN SHE BROKE AN ALMOST SPHINXLIKE SILENCE WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY REMARK BUNNY I AM SORRY BUT I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY OUT OF IT YOU MUST GET MARRIED TO SAY THAT I WAS SHOCKED BY THE OBSERVATION IS PUTTING IT MILDLY
WHEN WORD CAME OVER THE TELEPHONE TO DIGBY MISTER DE PELT'S VALET THAT MISTER DE PELT WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS AND IN NO CONDITION TO GO HOME ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE MESSAGE AND OBSERVING THAT DIGBY WAS ENGAGED IN A GAME OF BILLIARDS AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
AND ATTENDED TO THE WHOLE THING AND NOW I COME BACK TO FIND IT ALL A ER A MISTAKE WHY PAULINE IT'S POSITIVELY AWFUL WHAT CAN WE DO HENRIETTE WAS A PERFECT PICTURE OF DESPAIR I DON'T SUPPOSE WE CAN DO ANYTHING NOW SAID MISSUS SHADD RUEFULLY
SPLENDID SAID HENRIETTE WITH ENTHUSIASM
THERE WAS ALSO WHAT WAS CALLED A STEWARD'S REBATE ON THE MONTHLY BILLS WHICH IN CIRCLES WHERE LAVISH ENTERTAINMENT IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AMOUNTED TO A TIDY LITTLE INCOME IN ITSELF
I COULD WITHER WHEN THEY GREW TOO FAMILIAR BUT THE FOOTMEN WERE INTOLERABLE GUYERS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THEIR QUICK IRISH WIT HAD PUT ME TO MY TRUMPS TO MAINTAIN MY DIGNITY AND I HAD NOTICED OF LATE THAT THEIR ALLEGED FUN AT MY EXPENSE HAD MADE EVEN THE PARLORMAID GIGGLE IN A MOST IRRITATING FASHION
IN THIS OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY I THEN SECURED THE PHOTOGRAPHS DESIRED BY MY MISTRESS
YOURS AND CALL IT AN EVEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HE INTERRUPTED YOU OVERWHELM ME SAID I OF COURSE IF YOU WISH TO AND THE RAFFLESHURST COMMON COUNCIL WILL APPROPRIATE FIVE PER CENT OF THAT AMOUNT ANNUALLY FOR ITS MAINTENANCE HE INQUIRED
SAID HENRIETTE THE NEXT MORNING AS SHE HELD UP THE TIARA TO MY ADMIRING GAZE A FLASHING CORUSCATING BIT OF THE JEWELER'S ART THAT I VERILY BELIEVE WOULD HAVE TEMPTED THE SOUL OF HONOR ITSELF INTO RASCALLY WAYS
THE PEOPLE WE MET WHILE THERE MANY OF WHOM HAD CONTRIBUTED MOST LARGELY TO THE FUND WELCOMED US WITH OPEN ARMS LITTLE SUSPECTING HOW INTIMATELY CONNECTED THEY WERE WITH OUR SOURCES OF SUPPLY MISSUS GASTER IT IS TRUE
WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOD SHE DESCRIBES A COMPLETE CIRCLE WITH HER HEAD WHEN A COLD FORMAL HANDSHAKE IS NECESSARY SHE PERPETRATES AN EMBRACE AND THAT IS WHERE WE COME IN AT MY NEXT TUESDAY TEA SHE WILL BE PRESENT SHE WILL WEAR HER PEARLS SHE'LL BE STRUNG WITH THEM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
BUT I KNEW HER THE MINUTE SHE TOOK MY CLOAK SAID HENRIETTE SHE'S DYED HER HAIR
WITH A PEAL OF SILVERY LAUGHTER THAT FAIRLY MADE THE WELKIN RING
NOT A GEM THAT HAS APPEARED AT THE OPERA THE THEATRE THE CHARITY BALL THE HORSE SHOW
I MUST HAVE A CARNEGIE LIBRARY THAT IS ALL THERE IS ABOUT IT AND YOU MUST HELP THE IRON MASTER HAS ALREADY SPENT THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT SORT OF THING AND I DON'T SEE WHY IF OTHER PEOPLE CAN GET EM WE CAN'T
AGAIN I LAUGHED HE WON'T SAID I WITH A CONVICTION BORN OF EXPERIENCE
FULL OF SYMPATHY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN WITH THE PROJECTS OF MISSUS VAN RAFFLES AND NEVER IN THE LEAST OBJECTING ON MORAL GROUNDS TO ANY OF HER SCHEMES OF ACQUISITION I COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT THIS TIME SHE PROPOSED TO GO TOO FAR
SAID HENRIETTE THERE ARE SPLENDID OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACQUIRING THE GEMS THESE NEWPORT LADIES WEAR BY ONE WHO MAY BE STATIONED IN THE DRESSING ROOM THERE IS MISSUS ROCKERBILT'S TIARA FOR INSTANCE
THEIR MEMORY FOR FACES AND THE MONEY THEY SPEND IS SHORTER THAN THE PURSE OF A BANKRUPT HAVE NO FEAR AND AS USUAL HENRIETTE WAS RIGHT FOR THE NEXT FEBRUARY WHEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE WINTER FRESH AIR FUND SPENT A MONTH AT PALM BEACH
THAT SHE WAS VERY VERY ANGRY FORGIVE HER THIS TIME FOR MY SAKE MISSUS INNITT I PLEADED
DURING WHICH TIME THEY ACQUIRE THAT DEGREE OF SAVOIR FAIRE AND VENEER OF ETIQUETTE WHICH ALONE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO EXHIBIT THEM AT HER TEA PRECISELY SAID I SHE LETS THEM SLEEP IN THE BIG BOX STALLS OF HER STABLE WHERE THE EXTRA COACH HORSES WERE KEPT BEFORE THE MOTOR CAR CRAZE CAME IN
WELL I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING HENRIETTE I RETURNED WITH MORE POSITIVENESS THAN I COMMONLY SHOW I WILL NOT MARRY A LADY'S MAID AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS ABOUT IT YOU FORGET THAT I AM A GENTLEMAN IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT BUNNY SHE PLEADED
WHICH PLAN WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED OUT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE HANDIWORK OF THE DUCHESS OF SNARLEYOW WAS KNOCKED DOWN FOR EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO A CINCINNATI BREWER WHO HAD BEEN TRYING FOR EIGHT YEARS TO GET HIS NAME
ON WHAT GROUNDS SEVERAL SAID HENRIETTE UNFASTENING HER GLOVE
BY GAD AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE CHATTING AS AFFABLY WITH THE DUKE OF SNARLEYOW AND TOMMY DARE AS THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WIND NERVED ME TO ACTION
BY GETTING IN HER FINE WORK AHEAD OF HIS EXPLAINED HENRIETTE HE POINTED HER OUT TO ME IN PICCADILLY ONCE AND I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN HER FACE I HOPE SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU I OBSERVED
IT'S TOO LATE THE CARDS HAVE GONE TO EVERYBODY YOU HAVE ALL THE SUPPER NOT A SANDWICH HAS COME TO MY HOUSE AND I PRESUME ALL OF MISTER JOCKOBINSKI'S INSTRUMENTS AS WELL HAVE COME HERE HENRIETTE TURNED TO ME ALL MADAME SAID I BRIEFLY WELL
MAGNIFICENT I ASSERTED BUT WHICH IS THIS THE FORTY EIGHT DOLLAR ONE OR THE ORIGINAL THE ORIGINAL SAID HENRIETTE CARESSING THE BAUBLE YOU SEE WHEN WE GOT TO MY ROOM LAST NIGHT
BETTER CALL IT THE INCIDENT I PUT IN
AS TO MY CONDITION WHEN FOUND FULLY SUBSTANTIATED MY STORY AND WAS ACCEPTED AS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT I HAD NO CRIMINAL CONNECTION WITH THE ROBBERY THIS WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO ME BUT IT WAS GREATER WHEN HENRIETTE STROKED MY HAND AND CALLED ME POOR OLD BUNNY FOR I MUST SAY
WHEN I WAS DESPATCHED TO NEW YORK WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ORGANIZE MYSELF INTO A WINTER FRESH AIR SOCIETY TO HAVE LETTER HEADS PRINTED WITH THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT LADIES IN SOCIETY AS PATRONESSES HENRIETTE HAD SECURED PERMISSION FROM MISSUS GASTER MISSUS SLOYD JINKS MISSUS ROCKERBILT
EVEN THEN I BEGAN TUSH BUNNY SAID SHE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY EVEN THEN SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THESE PEOPLE WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT
HAD SLID ASLANT ATHWART HER CHEEK DEAR ME CRIED HENRIETTE RISING HURRIEDLY AND FULL OF WARM SYMPATHY HOW VERY AWKWARD OH DON'T SPEAK OF IT LAUGHED MISSUS ROCKERBILT AMIABLY
GREAT HEAVENS WHAT A HAUL I CRIED BUT HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND YOURSELF OH ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUNNY I REALLY FELT I COULD AFFORD IT WE'LL NET NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND I WAS SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A CHILL
I FOLLOWED OUT HENRIETTE'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AN HOUR LATER RETURNED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT FIAMETTA WAS INDEED SAFELY ON HER WAY GOOD SAID MISSUS RAFFLES AND NOW BUNNY FOR THE GASTER JEWELS MOUNTING THE STAIRS RAPIDLY TAKING CARE OF COURSE
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE WOULDN'T DO FOR ME
BUT A BLAZE OF LIGHT WITHIN FROM CELLAR TO ROOF
GAD I EJACULATED WALL STREET WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INFANT IN YOUR HANDS WELL THE FATEFUL DAY CAME HENRIETTE TO DO HER JUSTICE HAD HERSELF SPARED NO PAINS OR EXPENSE TO MAKE THE THING A SUCCESS I DOUBT IF THE GARDENS OF THE CONSTANT SCRAPPES EVER LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL
RAFFLES RANG HURRIEDLY FOR ME YES MADAM I SAID RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY TO HER CALL BUNNY SHE SAID HER HAND TREMBLING A LITTLE THE HOUR FOR ACTION HAS ARRIVED
GO DOWN TO LONG ISLAND BUY THE FARM PUT UP A FEW SIGNS CALLING ON PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES ADVERTISE THE PLACE IN BIG CAPITAL LETTERS IN THE SUNDAY PAPERS AS LIKELY TO BE THE PORT OF THE FUTURE CONSIDER YOURSELF DULY ELECTED MAYOR
I MUST TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN FOR NEW YORK SHE SAID EXCITEDLY YOU WILL HAVE THE MUSIC ROOM PREPARED AT ONCE BUNNY MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE WILL BE GIVEN HERE I AM GOING MYSELF TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS AT THE NEW YORK END
IF YOU GIVE THEM THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF MY PERSONAL APPEARANCE I'LL COME BACK AND KILL YOU SEE THE MAN'S VERY WORDS AND THEN SHE LAUGHED WHAT I CRIED IT WAS YOU WAS IT SHE RETURNED AIRILY
BUT IT IRRITATES ME MORE THAN I CAN SAY TO HAVE HER GET IT JUST THE SAME HEAVEN KNOWS I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT IF I HAD TO ABSCOND WITH A NATIONAL BANK TO GET THE MONEY IT ISN'T TOO LATE IS IT I QUERIED NOT TOO LATE ECHOED HENRIETTE
THAT THIS WAS AT ALL THE NOTION SHE HAD IN MIND AND WHAT LITTLE POISE I HAD WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED BY THE SUGGESTION I DREW MYSELF UP WITH DIGNITY HOWEVER IN A MOMENT AND ANSWERED HER VERY WELL DEAR I SAID WHENEVER YOU ARE READY I AM
AS THE MAID OF MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES TO HER EAGLE EYE IT WAS ANOTHER PROMISING FIELD FOR PROFIT FOR HENRIETTE HAD SPARED NEITHER PAINS NOR MONEY TO IMPRESS FIAMETTA WITH THE IDEA THAT NEXT TO MISSUS GASTER SHE WAS ABOUT AS LAVISH AND FINANCIALLY CAPABLE A HOUSEHOLDER
THE DEDBROKE HICKSES WITH NOTHING A YEAR THE OLIVER SLOSHINGTONS WITH AN INCOME OF JUDGMENTS THE STUDY OF THEIR ARRIVAL IS MIGHTY INTERESTING IT DOESN'T INTEREST ME MUCH QUOTH I
BUT IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF THE GARDEN I GOT HER SUFFICIENTLY WELL THOUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY POSED TO ACCOMPLISH MY PURPOSE ONCE I NEARLY YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION TO REACH MY HAND THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY
FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
ZEB SAW THAT THE ANIMAL HAD PROCEEDED NO FURTHER FOR THERE WAS ANOTHER SET OF TRACKS SHOWING WHERE IT HAD RETURNED TO THE PRAIRIE THOUGH NOT BY THE SAME PATH THE RIDER HAD GONE BEYOND THE FOOT MARKS OF A MAN COULD BE SEEN BEYOND IN THE MUD OF A HALF DRY ARROYO
LEAVING HIM FOR A TIME YOU WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT ONE IS THE GROOM OF THE STOLE BY NAME PHELIM O'NEAL
I HAVE YOU SPEAK QUITE TRULY ABOUT THAT MISTER STUMP AND AS TO THE POWER I HAVE THAT TOO IN A CERTAIN SENSE BUT AS YOU ARE AWARE IN OUR GREAT REPUBLIC THE MILITARY POWER MUST ALWAYS BE SUBSERVIENT TO THE CIVIL
YE'D MAKE A MAN A'MOST CONTENTED TO LIVE UNDER MARSHUL LAW NO DOUBT THUR AIR TIMES WHEN IT AIR THE BEST THO WE INDEPENDENT CITIZENS DON'T MUCH LIKE IT ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY AIR
AT ANOTHER WITH TEETH TO THE GROUND INDUSTRIOUSLY CROPPING THE SWEET GRAMMA GRASS THAT MAKES THE PASTURAGE OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN MY OPINION THE FINEST IN THE WORLD REJECTING MANY TALES TOLD OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN MOST OF THEM TOO GROTESQUE TO BE RECORDED
ONE TRUTHFUL EPISODE MUST NEEDS BE GIVEN SINCE IT FORMS AN ESSENTIAL CHAPTER OF THIS STRANGE HISTORY IN THE MIDST OF THE OPEN PRAIRIE THERE IS A MOTTE A COPPICE OR CLUMP OF TREES OF PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR ACRES IN SUPERFICIAL EXTENT
WHILE DWELLING WITHIN THE SETTLEMENTS THESE MEN ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE PESTS OF THE SOCIETY THAT SURROUNDS THEM
I KNOW'D IT WAN'T DID BY THE CLAWS O ANY VARMINT AN IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE BLOW EYTHER O A STONE OR A STICK
THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS SICK CHAMBER HE SET ABOUT MATURING HIS PLANS WHICH COMPREHENDED THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MUSTANGER HE DID NOT PURPOSE DOING THE DEED HIMSELF
AT THE SAME TIME WHISKING HIS SABRE OUT OF ITS SCABBARD AND INTERPOSING ITS LONG BLADE BETWEEN THE DISPUTANTS HOLD YOUR FIRE I COMMAND YOU BOTH DROP YOUR MUZZLES OR BY THE ALMIGHTY I'LL TAKE THE ARM OFF THE FIRST OF YOU THAT TOUCHES TRIGGER
EITHER ABOUT THE MURDER OR ITS MOTIVE AND THE PRISONER IS SPARED FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THAT FIENDISH DEED THAT LEFT THE DEAD BODY OF HENRY POINDEXTER WITHOUT A HEAD
INTERSPERSED WITH PROFANE WORDS NOT PERFECTLY PRONOUNCED BUT SLURRED FROM A THICK TONGUE OVER WHICH BUT A SHORT WHILE BEFORE MUST HAVE PASSED A STUPENDOUS QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL
CALCULATED TO INSPIRE ALL THREE WITH THE MOST TERRIBLE APPREHENSIONS A NEGRO MAN ONE OF THE FIELD SLAVES OF THE PLANTATION STOOD HOLDING A HORSE THAT WAS SADDLED AND BRIDLED THE ANIMAL WET WITH THE DEWS OF THE NIGHT
COME MISTER CALHOUN SAID THE MAJOR IN A SOOTHING TONE SIX SHOTS OUGHT TO SATISFY ANY REASONABLE MAN WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO THE STEEL BEFORE YOU FINISH FIRING ONE OR THE OTHER OF YOU DAMN THE KNIFE INTERRUPTED CALHOUN UNBUTTONING HIS COAT
HE WOULD THINK IT STRANGER TO SEE A SINGLE HORSE IN THE SAME SITUATION THE FORMER WOULD SIMPLY BE FOLLOWED BY THE REFLECTION A DROVE OF MUSTANGS THE LATTER CONDUCTS TO A DIFFERENT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN WHICH THERE IS AN AMBIGUITY THE SOLITARY STEED MIGHT BE ONE OF TWO THINGS
THE MARE AT THE HEAD THE MAN BEARING BEHIND IT WAS HE OF CONNEMARA WHO COMPLETED THE ILL MATCHED TEAM THE OLD HUNTER HAD KEPT HIS PROMISE THAT PHELIM SHOULD TAKE HIS FULL SHARE O THE CARRYIN
HE WAS INSTINCTIVELY STRAYING TOWARDS THE HACIENDA TO WHOM DID HE BELONG THE QUESTION WAS NOT ASKED ALL PRESENT KNEW HIM TO BE THE HORSE OF HENRY POINDEXTER
ENOUGH TO HAVE CLEARED OUT THE CARCASS OF A HULL BUFFALO COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF BUT CONTINUED THE SCOUT IN A MUTTERED UNDERTONE IF YOU WISH ME TO FOLLOW UP THE SIGN AS IT OUGHT TO BE DONE YOU'LL ORDER THE OTHERS TO STAY BACK
ONLY THE CONJECTURE THAT HE WOULD SHORTLY MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AS SEVERAL MINUTES PASSED WITHOUT HIS COMING IN THE PLANTER QUIETLY OBSERVED THAT IT WAS RATHER STRANGE OF HENRY TO BE BEHIND TIME AND WONDER WHERE HE COULD BE
SUCH WAS THE TABLEAU THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE SPECTATORS AS THE SULPHUROUS SMOKE DRIFTED OUT BY THE CURRENT BETWEEN THE TWO DOORS GAVE THEM A CHANCE OF DISTINGUISHING OBJECTS WITHIN THE SALOON
HOW A COMPANY OF MUSTANGERS HAS FOR THE NONCE CONVERTED ITSELF INTO A BAND OF CUADRILLA OF SALTEADORES OR DISGUISED AS INDIANS LEVIED BLACK MAIL UPON THE TRAIN OF THE PRAIRIE TRAVELLER
THAT WAS A WIDE WORD AND SIGNIFIED ANYWHERE WITHIN A SEMICIRCLE OF SOME HUNDREDS OF MILES BESIDES THE INDIANS WERE NOW UPON THE WAR TRAIL AND IN AN ISOLATED SETTLEMENT SUCH AS THAT OF THE LEONA AS LIKELY TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE FROM THE EAST
NO ANOTHER SIGNAL HAD BEEN AGREED UPON AND IT WAS GIVEN A STENTORIAN VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING OUT THE SIMPLE MONOSYLLABLE
YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S PASSED BUT NOT WHAT'S TO COME
TIME ENOUGH TO TALK WHEN YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TO JUSTIFY IT CRY BOO TO A GOOSE BUT DON'T FANCY YOUR BIG WORDS ARE GOING TO FRIGHTEN ME MISTER CALHOUN QUICK GENTLEMEN I'M IMPATIENT TO PUT AN END TO HIS BOASTING AND BLASPHEMY
AND THE FAIR FORM LYING UNDERNEATH THE HEARTS OF THE TEXANS WERE TOUCHED AS PERHAPS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A STRANGE THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
FALLING IN BROAD DIVERGENT BANDS UPON THE ROUGH GRAVEL OUTSIDE NEITHER WAS IN FRONT OF THE CONTIGUOUS ENTRANCE BUT A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE JUST CLEAR OF THE LIGHT NEITHER WAS IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE BUT CROUCHING
SECOND BY THE SERVANT OF MAURICE THE MUSTANGER THIRDLY BY CASSIUS CALHOUN ON HIS MIDNIGHT EXPLORATION OF THE CHAPPARAL FOURTHLY BY THE SHAM INDIANS ON THAT SAME NIGHT AND FIFTHLY BY ZEB STUMP ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING
ONE OF THIS KIDNEY WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD BECOME RECALLED TO THE MEMORY OF CASSIUS CALHOUN THE LATTER REMEMBERED HAVING MET THE MAN IN THE BAR ROOM OF THE HOTEL
I'VE INSULTED AND GROSSLY TOO A NOBLE FELLOW INSULTED A NOBLE FELLOW HA HA HA YOU'RE MAD BY HEAVENS YOU'RE MAD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAD I FOLLOWED YOUR COUNSEL COUSIN CASH
THE TRAMPLING OF FEET UPON THE BOARDED FLOOR AT INTERVALS THE CLEAR RINGING CRACK OF THE REVOLVERS BUT NEITHER OF THE VOICES OF THE MEN WHOSE INSENSATE PASSIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS COMMOTION
DARR MASSR HENRY AM TOO THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE IN ALL THIS PURSUED THE PLANTER AS PLUTO SHUFFLED OUT OF THE SALA HENRY FROM HOME AND AT NIGHT TOO WHERE CAN HE HAVE GONE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY ONE HE WOULD BE VISITING AT SUCH UNSEASONABLE HOURS
AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT SHOWS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THEGITHER THE ANIMALS IT MIGHT BE RESTLESS AND MOVIN ABOUT AS FOR THE TIME THEY'VE TAKEN LONG ENOUGH TO SMOKE A CIGAR APIECE CLOSE TO THE TEETH TOO HERE ARE THE STUMPS NOT ENOUGH LEFT TO FILL A FELLOW'S PIPE
ON LOOKING INSIDE THE HAT HE READ TWO NAMES FIRST THAT OF A NEW ORLEANS HATTER WHOSE CARD WAS PASTED IN THE CROWN AND THEN IN WRITING ANOTHER WELL KNOWN TO HIM HENRY POINDEXTER
WHILE THE ARMAS DE AGUA STRAPPED OVER HIS LIMBS COVER THEM FROM THIGH TO SPUR CONCEALING ALL BUT THEIR OUTLINES HIS BODY IS BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AS IF TO EASE THE HORSE IN GETTING HIS SNOUT TO THE SWARD WHICH THE LONG BRIDLE REIN SURRENDERED TO ITS FULL LENGTH ENABLES HIM TO DO
HE FOLLOWED THE FORMER HE WAS NOT SURPRISED AT THEIR BRINGING HIM OUT INTO THE AVENUE CLOSE TO THE POOL OF BLOOD BY THE COYOTES LONG SINCE LICKED DRY HE MIGHT HAVE TRACED THEM RIGHT UP TO IT BUT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF HORSE TRACKS THAT HAD TRODDEN THE GROUND LIKE A SHEEP PEN
ARE YOU SURE ASKED THE PLANTER SERIOUSLY STIRRED BY THE INTELLIGENCE SATIN SHOO MASS WOODLEY
THE GIFT OF HER WHO ALONE COULD HAVE SECURED IT SUCH A PLACE TURNED ASIDE THE SHOT CAUSING IT TO RICOCHET NOT HARMLESSLY HOWEVER
IT CAN'T BE A GREAT WAYS OFF LET US PROCEED THITHER THEN SAID THE MAJOR I SHALL COMMAND THE PEOPLE TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE HAVING ISSUED THE COMMAND IN A VOICE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY HIS FOLLOWING THE MAJOR RODE AWAY FROM THE BLOODSTAINED SPOT PRECEDED BY THE TRACKER
AT THE SAME INSTANT WAS HEARD A DIFFERENT VOICE FROM THE ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY SPOKEN IT WAS CALHOUN'S NO LONGER IN ROISTERING BRAVADO
ZEB SAW THAT SEVERAL SHOD HORSES HAD PASSED ALONG IT SOME DAYS BEFORE AND IT WAS THIS THAT CAUSED HIM TO COME BACK AND EXAMINE IT HE COULD TELL TO A DAY TO AN HOUR WHEN THE HORSES HAD PASSED AND FROM THE SIGN ITSELF
HIS BREAST BENT DOWN TO THE POMMEL AND HIS EYES ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN READING THE GROUND OVER WHICH HE WAS GUIDING HIS HORSE THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN ASCERTAINING HIS OCCUPATION ZEB STUMP GUESSED IT AT A GLANCE HE WAS TRACKING THE HEADLESS RIDER
WHO ONLY ANSWERS WITH A LOOK SO CALM AS ALMOST TO BETRAY INDIFFERENCE YES I INTENDED TO KILL HIM I HAD MY REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY WERE IT'S NO USE NOW
AT A POINT WHERE THE TRACKS OF TWO HORSES CONVERGED WITH THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING FROM THIS POINT THE THREE COINCIDED AT TIMES PARTING AND RUNNING PARALLEL FOR A SCORE OF YARDS OR SO BUT AGAIN COMING TOGETHER AND OVERLAPPING ONE ANOTHER THE HORSES WERE ALL SHOD
THE BREAKFAST BELL OF CASA DEL CORVO HAD SOUNDED ITS SECOND AND LAST SUMMONS PRECEDED BY A STILL EARLIER SIGNAL FROM A HORN INTENDED TO CALL IN THE STRAGGLERS FROM REMOTE PARTS OF THE PLANTATION
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE AN UNCOURTEOUS HOST THE CHICKEN HEARTED FOOL FOOL MYSELF TO HAVE TRUSTED TO SUCH A HOPE
HE HAD TURNED TO GO OUT OF THE GLADE WHEN A THOUGHT ONCE MORE STAYED HIM
THE YOUNG GENTLEMANS RODE OFF A A QUICK PACE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF OVERTAKING HIM THIS WAS ALL MISTER OBERDOFFER KNEW OF THE MATTER AND ALL HE COULD BE EXPECTED TO TELL THE INTELLIGENCE THOUGH CONTAINING SEVERAL POINTS BUT ILL UNDERSTOOD
ONCE OUTSIDE THE MAJOR TOOK NO FURTHER PART IN THE AFFAIR AS THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE POST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF PLACE FOR HIM TO HAVE GIVEN ENCOURAGEMENT TO A FIGHT EVEN BY HIS INTERFERING TO SEE THAT IT SHOULD BE A FAIR ONE
IMPUTATION OF HAVING MURDERED MY OWN COUSIN I DID TAKE HIS LIFE AS I'VE TOLD YOU YOU ARE ALL ASKING WHY AND CONJECTURING ABOUT THE MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE
YOU WONDER AT THAT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED I KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE THE SURPRISE CULMINATES IN A SHOUT SUPPRESSED AS THE SPEAKER PROCEEDS YES BY MISTAKE
TRULY SELFISH IN HIS OWN HEART HE HAD NO FAITH IN FRIENDSHIPS AND WHILE CONFINED TO HIS COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME FEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS DEATH BED
WHO LAST SAW HENRY POINDEXTER HIS FATHER AND COUSIN WERE FIRST APPEALED TO THE FORMER HAD LAST SEEN HIS SON AT THE SUPPER TABLE AND SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE GONE THENCE TO HIS BED
MORE'N WAR WROTE INSIDE I RECK'N BEEN USED FOR THE WAD O A GUN
AN I KNOWS WHO THET ONE AIR LEESTWISE I HEV A TOLABLE CLUR GUESS O HIM WHO
COULD BE HEARD THE SONOROUS TONES OF A BELL THAT BELL WHOSE SOUNDS HAD BEEN HITHERTO HEARD ONLY AS SYMBOLS OF JOY CALLING MEN TOGETHER TO PARTAKE OF THAT WHICH PERPETUATES LIFE WAS NOW LISTENED TO AS A SUMMONS OF DEATH
GORRAMITY I FEAR DE TROUBLE WUSS DAN DAT
AND MAYBE IT'LL FETCH US TO SOME SENSIBLE CONCLOOSION AM I TO TELL THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHAT I THINK O'T PERHAPS BETTER NOT HE KNOWS ENOUGH ALREADY IT WILL AT LEAST FALL LIGHTER UPON HIM IF HE FIND THINGS OUT BY PIECEMEAL SAY NOTHING OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN
THE INDIANS WERE OUT AND NEAR AT HAND REAPING THEIR HARVEST OF SCALPS THAT OF YOUNG POINDEXTER WAS THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THEIR SANGUINARY GLEANING
NOT AS IF FROM FEAR BUT LIKE A RUNNER ABOUT TO MAKE A START AND STRAINING UPON THE SPRING BOTH WERE LOOKING INWARDS INTO THE SALOON WHERE NO SOUND COULD BE HEARD SAVE THE TICKING OF A CLOCK
PROCLAIMED HIM THE BEARER OF EVENTFUL TIDINGS WELL CRIED HIS MASTER WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO SPEAK IS HE THERE NO MASS WOODLEY REPLIED THE BLACK IN A VOICE THAT BETRAYED A LARGE MEASURE OF EMOTION
I SHA'N'T OBJECT TO ANYTHING THAT'S FAIR ASSENTED THE IRISHMAN DEVIL A BIT I SHALL FIGHT WITH THE WEAPON I HOLD IN MY HAND DOGGEDLY DECLARED CALHOUN AGREED THE VERY WEAPON FOR ME WAS THE REJOINDER OF HIS ADVERSARY
BUT BEFORE GOING SO FAR HE WAS STAYED BY THE DISCOVERY OF SOME FRESH SIGN TOO INTERESTING TO BE CARELESSLY EXAMINED IN A PLACE WHERE THE UNDERWOOD GREW THICK HE CAME UPON A SPOT WHERE A MAN HAD REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
THE SABLE COACHEE ACTING AS TABLE WAITER WAS IN THE SALA HOVERING AROUND THE CHAIRS GO TO HENRY'S SLEEPING ROOM
I'VE NO IDEA OF BEING BORED BY A BULLET NOT INTENDED FOR ME WAIT TILL THE REST OF US CAN WITHDRAW TO A SAFE DISTANCE AND YOU MAY CRACK AWAY TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT NOW SIR WILL THAT BE AGREEABLE TO YOU
AS IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN SLAKED OVER THEM THIS WAS SEEN BOTH ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE HORSE AND THE FLAP OF THE SADDLE OF COURSE IT WAS THE BODY OF THE RIDER AS IT SLIPPED LIFELESS TO THE EARTH THERE WERE SOME WHO SPOKE WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY AS TO THE TIME
THESE MEN WERE MANOEUVRING AS IF ACTUATED BY A COMMON IMPULSE THEY STOOD CONTIGUOUS TO THE ENTRANCE DOORS AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE BAR ROOM THROUGH BOTH OF WHICH GLARED THE LIGHT OF THE CAMPHINE LAMPS
CLOSE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE SPINE
THE WHOLE SETTLEMENT WOULD HAVE SAID I HAD DONE RIGHT MY COUSIN A YOUNG LADY BETRAYED BY A COMMON SCAMP A HORSE TRADER WHO WOULD HAVE SAID A WORD AGAINST IT SUCH A CHANCE WHY HAVE I MISSED IT DEATH AND THE DEVIL
AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
A MORE NAMELESS ADVENTURER WAS TOO MUCH TO BE ENDURED WITH EQUANIMITY EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINED BY THE INFLICTION
A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
LOUISE POINDEXTER LADY GERALD SHE MUST NOW BE CALLED DURING HER SOJOURN IN THE EMERALD ISLE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE HER TO JEALOUSY ONLY ONCE AGAIN DID THIS FELL PASSION
THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
WAL THERE'S NO TIME TO STAN SPEKLATIN HYUR
AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
YOU MAY SPEAK YOUR MIND FREELY THEN MY MIND AIR THET THE MAN WHO HEZ DUD THIS MURDER AIN'T MAURICE THE MOWSTANGER THAT'S MY OWN BELIEF YOU KNOW IT ALREADY HAVE YOU NOTHING MORE TO COMMUNICATE
AH MISTER STUMP GLAD TO SEE YOU SO SOON HAVE YOU MADE ANY DISCOVERY IN THIS QUEER AFFAIR FROM YOUR QUICK RETURN I CAN ALMOST SAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING I HOPE IN FAVOUR OF THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNG FELLOW
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT IS THE SECURING FOR HIS WIFE THE WOMAN HE HAD LONG FIERCELY LOVED HIS COUSIN LOUISE HE HAD COME TO KNOW THAT HE STOOD BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER CONSENT
THE TITLE WOULD HAVE COUNTED FOR LITTLE NOR DID ITS OWNER CARE TO CARRY IT BUT BY A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDANT ON AN IRISH BARONETCY
YOU ARE BY JESUS CHRIST AND GENERAL JACKSON YOU'RE NOT VERY POLITE COUSIN CASH THOUGH AFTER THE LANGUAGE I'VE BEEN LATELY USING MYSELF I MIGHT EXCUSE YOU PERHAPS YOU WILL ONE DAY IMITATE ME
BEYOND HE HAD CONTINUED HIS CAREER RAPID AND RECKLESS AS EVER BEYOND THE PARTY ALONG WITH SPANGLER HAD PROCEEDED WITHOUT STAYING TO INQUIRE WHY THE HORSE HAD SHIED FROM HIS TRACK ZEB STUMP WAS MORE INQUISITIVE AND PAUSED UPON THIS SPOT
WITH AN ELASTIC STEP HIS COUNTENANCE RADIANT OF TRIUMPH THE OLD HUNTER STRODE AWAY FROM THE TREE NO LONGER UPON THE CATTLE PATH BUT THAT TAKEN BY THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN SO VIOLENTLY DISMOUNTED TO ONE UNACCUSTOMED TO THE CHAPPARAL HE MIGHT HAVE APPEARED GOING WITHOUT A GUIDE
AN THAT SHINDY BEOUT WHICH SHE TOLT ME HERSELF
THOUGH THERE IS NO PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN THERE IS SOMETHING NEW TO BE NOTED HITHERTO HE HAS BEEN SEEN GOING ALONE NOW HE IS IN COMPANY IT CANNOT BE CALLED AGREEABLE CONSISTING AS IT DOES OF WOLVES
NOT ONE OF WHICH MIGHT COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TRUTH SUCH A HORSE AND JUST SUCH A RIDER WERE SEEN UPON THE PRAIRIES OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD EIGHTEEN FIFTY SOMETHING
NEITHER MADE AN ATTEMPT TO SKULK OUTSIDE
ONLY THEM AS AIR LIKE TO TAKE IT INTO THUR OWN HANDS
FOR I SOMETIMES RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS UNSIGNED NOTES FROM MY FRIENDS THE REFUGEES WHEN THEY DESIRED TO SEE ME THE EXILES ARE CONTINUALLY UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE OKHRANNOE OTDELENIE OR SECRET POLICE
WE SAT DOWN TO A ROUGH UNCIVILISED MEAL THE EVENING WE SPENT IN SMOKING AND DRINKING VODKA PRASCOVIE AND I BEING ABLE TO CARRY ON A PRIVATE CONVERSATION BY SPEAKING ENGLISH I ASKED WHY SHE WAS SO UNUSUALLY THOUGHTFUL
I'M SO ANXIOUS TO KNOW THE VERDICT I TOLD HER AND AN EXCLAMATION OF RELIEF INVOLUNTARILY ESCAPED HER THIS DID NOT STRIKE ME AS PECULIAR AT THE TIME
AND THE WHOLE PLACE VIBRATED
WHY ARE YOU HERE I INQUIRED BREATHLESSLY
A SCAR I SHRIEKED IN DISMAY
THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE FREEDOM THE NARODNOE PRAVO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT POSSESS BUT HE ASSURED ME THAT THE TIME FOR AUTOCRACY WAS PAST THAT THE TZAR'S EMPIRE HAD OUTGROWN THE PERIOD OF BENEVOLENT DESPOTISM
BUT I SAW VERY LITTLE OF DICK HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMISSION FROM ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS TO MAKE A SERIES OF SKETCHES OF SCENERY IN SCOTLAND
AND THAT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WERE QUITE CAPABLE OF GOVERNING THEMSELVES
THE FRENCH WINDOWS OF WHICH OPENED OUT UPON A SPACIOUS TENNIS LAWN AROUND THE WALLS WERE HUNG SEVERAL CHOICE PAINTINGS AND I NOTICED THAT UPON THE TABLE LAY A NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS SIMILAR TO THOSE
AS USUAL A NUMBER OF THE CORPS DIPLOMATIQUE WERE PRESENT AND AMONG THEM
BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SHE WAS IN NEED OF REST I AM SORRY I AM BREAKING DOWN SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY AND LAUGHING AT THE SAME TIME BUT I'M ONLY A WOMAN IT WAS INDEED VERY KIND OF YOU TO HAVE BEEN BOTHERED WITH ME
MYSELF AND MY SERVANT CIVILITY AND ATTENTION ON THE PART OF POLICE OFFICIALS AT LENGTH WE PASSED THROUGH THE URALS AND ALIGHTED
HE CONTRACTED TYPHOID WHILE WE WERE PLAYING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT TERMINATED FATALLY ETHEL I SAID GRAVELY TAKING HER HAND IN MINE YOU HAVE FASCINATED DICK CARRUTHERS MY FRIEND
AT THE PRISON AT IRKUTSK FATHER AND DAUGHTER MET WHILE THERE PRINCE PAVLOVITCH KOSTOMAROFF THE GOVERNOR OF THE YENISEISK PROVINCE
WHENEVER HE PAID FLYING VISITS TO LONDON HOWEVER HE ALWAYS LOOKED ME UP BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NEVER MENTIONED ETHEL NEVERTHELESS I ASCERTAINED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY MET
AND AN OUTLAW UNTIL TO DAY WHAT YOU ASK HAS BECOME OF HER FAR AWAY IN A SECLUDED VALLEY IN THE HARZ UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MYSTIC BROCKEN
AND TURNING FOUND MARIETTE OUR MAID OF ALL WORK MY WIFE WHERE IS MY WIFE I GASPED
BUT AS IT HAD BEEN SNOWING HEAVILY DURING THE NIGHT NO FOOTPRINTS WERE VISIBLE
AND YOU WILL TREAT HIM AS YOU TREATED ME NO NO I LOVE HIM SHE SAID IN A FIERCE HALF WHISPER ADDING
WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
DEAD HE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG AS SOON AS HIS DAUGHTER HAD LEFT WITH YOU BUT WAS ARRESTED AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN THE FORTRESS WHILE THERE HE WROTE A CONFESSION OF THE MURDER AND AFTERWARDS COMMITTED SUICIDE AND WILL THEY ARREST PRASCOVIE
ETHEL WILL NOT SIT FOR ANY OTHER SUBJECT IT HARDLY DOES HER JUSTICE DOES IT IT IS A STRANGE FANCY OF MINE SHE EXPLAINED WHEN I HAD GREETED HER I'M SURE THE DRESS IS VERY BECOMING ISN'T IT
OF THE HARROWING DETAILS THE PROSPECT OF THIS MISSION DELIGHTED ME FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CERTAIN TO BE FRAUGHT WITH A GOOD DEAL OF EXCITING ADVENTURE BUT IT WOULD ALSO ENABLE ME TO COMPLETE THE NOVEL ALREADY HALF WRITTEN
I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
AND MY HOST RETURNED INTO THE ROOM AS HE ENTERED HE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN POLISH PATOIS TO HIS DAUGHTER IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ANNOUNCEMENT OF A STARTLING CHARACTER FOR UTTERING AN EJACULATION OF ALARM SHE REELED AND ALMOST FELL IN A MOMENT HOWEVER
YOU SEE WE ARE STRANGERS AH I FORGOT I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF SHE SAID LAUGHING I'M PRASCOVIE SOUVAROFF I KNOW YOUR NAME
WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
SOON WE WERE OUT UPON THE GREAT POST ROAD AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO OTHER OBJECT VISIBLE ON THE BROAD SNOW COVERED PLAIN BUT THE LONG STRAIGHT LINE OF BLACK TELEGRAPH POLES AND STRIPED VERST POSTS
CONTROLLER OF THE PRISON WAS IGNORANT OF THE SECRET UNION BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE ALSO BECAME ENAMOURED OF HIS FAIR CAPTIVE AT LENGTH IN RETURN FOR HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM HE ALLOWED HER AND HER FATHER COMPARATIVE FREEDOM
AND ON THE DAY OF THE INQUEST I AGAIN CALLED AT SPRINGFIELD LODGE
AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
THOUGH NOW SO NEAR THE WOMAN I LOVED I SAW VERY LITTLE OF HER INDEED
SEATED HERSELF AT THE PIANO AND SANG AN OLD RUSSIAN LOVE SONG IN A SWEET CONTRALTO FULL OF HARMONY AND TENDERNESS IN THE MEANTIME HER FATHER HAD LEFT US AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE TURNED UPON THE MUSIC STOOL AND WITH FEW FOREWORDS
THE MORE LIGHT HEARTED SHE BECAME ARRIVING AT LAST AT TOMSK WE REMAINED THERE THREE WEEKS DURING WHICH TIME I VISITED THE KAMERAS OF THE FORWARDING PRISON
I DISTINGUISHED THE VOICE OF THE SERVANT ANSWERING HER MASTER AND AFTER SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION A MAN EXCLAIMED DOBROI NOTSCHE SOUVAROFF GOOD NIGHT TO THIS THE MAN ADDRESSED REPLIED IN A CHEERY TONE THE FRONT DOOR SLAMMED
HER DISAPPEARANCE WAS ALL THE MORE PUZZLING I EXAMINED HER BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING IN IT EXCEPT ARTICLES OF MALE WEARING APPAREL
UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
AND SAT AT MY WRITING TABLE FAR INTO THE NIGHT FINISHING SOME WORK UPON WHICH I HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY I SPENT IN PACKING MY TRAPS AND OTHERWISE PREPARING FOR A LONG ABSENCE IN THE EVENING
METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
AND THE SHOCKING BRUTALITY AND INHUMAN TREATMENT TO WHICH THE OFT TIMES INNOCENT CONVICTS WERE SUBJECTED WERE CONTINUALLY REACHING LONDON FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND PUBLIC FEELING AGAINST RUSSIAN AUTOCRACY
WHOM I HAD FIRST MET IN COLOGNE
WAS KNOWN TO BE FALSE BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HIGH OFFICIAL HOWEVER
PERFECTLY SATISFYING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HERSELF OUT OF THE WORLD EVEN WELCOME OLD FELLOW DICK CRIED
AND SHEEPSKIN BOOTS WE HAD BOUGHT TOOK OUR SEATS THE BAGGAGE AND PROVISIONS HAVING BEEN PACKED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CONVEYANCE
SHE ADDED LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE EARNESTLY OH WHAT'S THAT I ASKED I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME TO SIBERIA TO SIBERIA YOU I REPEATED IN ASTONISHMENT YES I HEAR YOU ARE GOING
STRAPPED MY FUR RUG AROUND MY NECK AND STRETCHING MYSELF UPON THE HARD PALLET SOON DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING WHEN I HAD DRESSED I KNOCKED SEVERAL TIMES AT PRASCOVIE'S DOOR BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY SUBSEQUENTLY I PUSHED IT OPEN AND ENTERED
FROM MORN TILL EVE ON SHOW SUNDAY CAMPDEN HILL IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY THE CARRIAGES OF THE CURIOUS AND STUDIOS ARE BESIEGED BY FASHIONABLE CROWDS WHOSE CHATTER AND LAUGHTER MINGLES PLEASANTLY WITH THE CLINKING OF TEA CUPS
THE SITTING ROOM WAS A BARE UNCARPETED PLACE WITH A LARGE BRICK STOVE IN THE CENTRE A PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN UPON THE WALL A WOODEN TABLE AND THREE OR FOUR ROUGH CHAIRS WHILE THE LITTLE DENS
THEN SOUVAROFF RELATED THE STORY OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HIS TRANSPORTATION TO SIBERIA HIS WORK IN THE KARA SILVER MINES AND HIS SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE AND JOURNEY TO ENGLAND WHERE HE HAD BEEN JOINED BY HIS DAUGHTER SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE THOUGHT SAID HE
WE HAD HELD THOSE WALLS
THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
I KNEW THE TRUTH HE WAS DEAD HIS AGE WAS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE HE HAD GREY EYES FAIR HAIR AND BEARD
WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
AND WHICH I HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO PUT ASIDE OWING TO LACK OF INFORMATION REGARDING LIFE IN THE ASIATIC PENAL SETTLEMENTS THAT EVENING AFTER CALLING UPON GRIGOROVITCH AND INFORMING HIM OF MY PROJECTED JOURNEY I RETURNED HOME
WHO HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED HOW TO ACT EXTRACTED EVERYTHING FROM THE DEAD MAN'S POCKETS THAT WOULD LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION HENCE HIS BURIAL IN A NAMELESS GRAVE DO YOU ASSERT THAT HE WAS MURDERED
BREATHLESSLY I MOUNTED THE LONG FLIGHTS OF STAIRS THAT LED TO MY HOME AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH MY KEY ENTERING OUR LITTLE SALON I LOOKED AROUND IN THE COLD GREY LIGHT OF DAWN
YOU MUST BE TERRIBLY TIRED I SAID RECOLLECTING THAT IT WAS TWO DAYS SINCE WE DROVE OUT OF TOMSK AND THAT OWING TO THE LACK OF ACCOMMODATION AT THE POST HOUSES WE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REST NO I'M NOT VERY TIRED SHE REPLIED
HAD BECOME A SUBJECT OF MUCH COMMENT IN ENGLAND
HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
TOWARDS THE SHADY WOOD A FILM GATHERS IN MY EYES AND I AM CARRIED BACK INTO THE TERRIBLE PAST TO THOSE BLACK FATEFUL DAYS WHEN FRANCE LAY HELPLESS UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF THE INVADER
THAT MARKED OUR ROUTE DAY AFTER DAY WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY OFTEN PASSING THROUGH MILES OF GLOOMY PINE FORESTS AND THEN OUT AGAIN UPON THE GREAT BARREN STEPPES FREQUENTLY WE MET CONVOYS OF CONVICTS
IF YOU PUBLISH THE PARAGRAPH I WILL SEE SHE DOES NOT GET HOLD OF A COPY OF THE PAPER VERY WELL I SAID I'LL DO AS YOU WISH IT WAS A PUZZLING PARAGRAPH BUT I HAD ALREADY CEASED TO BE ASTONISHED AT ANY ACTION ON THE PART OF THESE MEN
TO BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES I AM DEAD
THAT JUST THEN I WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY DEPARTURE TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE HOWEVER MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND I TOLD HER TO ADMIT THE STRANGER YOU I CRIED
AND WAS MUCH PUZZLED AT ITS SIGNIFICANCE DO THEY KNOW HIS NAME SHE ASKED EAGERLY NO THERE WAS NOTHING TO SERVE AS A CLUE TO HIS IDENTITY POOR FELLOW SHE SIGHED SYMPATHETICALLY I WONDER WHO HE WAS
THE THING'S IMPOSSIBLE I CRIED WARMLY I WILL NOT ALLOW IT YOU MAY BE FRIENDS BUT HE SHALL NEVER MARRY YOU HOW CRUEL YOU ARE SHE SAID WITH A TOUCH OF SADNESS BUT AFTER ALL YOUR APPREHENSIONS ARE GROUNDLESS
HE QUICKLY DISCOVERED THE RUSE AND ASCERTAINED THAT THE PRINCE HAD CONNIVED AT THEIR ESCAPE OUR SECRET POLICE TRACKED THE FUGITIVES TO THEIR HIDING PLACE IN LONDON STILL UNAWARE THAT SHE WAS THE PRINCE'S WIFE KOBITA OBTAINED LEAVE OF ABSENCE
HOLD HE GASPED IN FRENCH IN A LOW HOARSE TONE
ANY NEWS AFFECTING US TRAVELS RAPIDLY I I HAVE AN INTENSE DESIRE TO SEE WHAT THE COUNTRY BEYOND THE URALS IS LIKE WHO TOLD YOU I WAS GOING I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY SHE REPLIED ALL I ASK
I WAS SITTING AT HOME READING AND SMOKING IN A VERY LAZY MOOD ONE WINTER'S EVENING WHEN THE SERVANT GIRL ENTERED AND HANDED ME A SOILED CRUMPLED LETTER WHICH SHE SAID HAD BEEN LEFT BY A STRANGE LOOKING FOREIGN WOMAN THIS DID NOT SURPRISE ME
AND FROM HIS DRESS I JUDGED THAT HE BELONGED TO THE UPPER CLASS THE HEAVY OVERCOAT HE WORE WAS UNBUTTONED AND A SILK MUFFLER WAS WRAPPED LIGHTLY AROUND HIS THROAT A GLANCE SUFFICED TO ASCERTAIN THAT HE WAS
MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE ADMINISTERED IT WAS SOMEWHAT NOVEL HE PREPARED TO RECEIVE HIS ENEMY BY ALLOWING THE NAIL OF THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND TO GROW LONG AFTERWARDS THINNING IT TO A POINT AS FINE AS A NEEDLE
IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
THAT SERVED AS SLEEPING APARTMENTS CONTAINED NOTHING BEYOND A CHAIR AND A STRAW MATTRESS IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER OUR ARRIVAL THAT THE GREAT SAMOVAR WAS PLACED UPON THE TABLE AND TOGETHER WITH THE TWO SINISTER LOOKING FELLOWS WHO KEPT THE PLACE
THE PRINCE NOT BEING GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE IN WHICH HIS WIFE WAS IMPRISONED
STILL LOVING HER GOOD AFTERNOON I HOPE I DON'T DISTURB YOU LOOKING UP FROM MY WORK I SAW ETHEL NOT AT ALL PRAY SIT DOWN I SAID COLDLY
OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
AND PRESENTLY THE HEAVY DOOR WAS OPENED BY A RUSSIAN MAID SERVANT WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN BROKEN ENGLISH I TOLD HER MY NAME AND SHOWED HER THE NOTE I HAD RECEIVED
THAT SIBERIA WAS NO PLACE FOR A DELICATELY REARED WOMAN AND POINTED OUT THE UNINVITING PROSPECT OF A WINTER JOURNEY OF FIVE THOUSAND MILES IN A SLEIGH BESIDES I ADDED
SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
WILL NOT BETRAY ME WHEN LAST I HEARD OF YOU TWO YEARS AGO I SAID YOU WERE A LIEUTENANT OF DRAGOONS TO NIGHT YOU ARE HERE INSIDE PARIS DISGUISED
BEARING THE WORDS ROSE HENAULT EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO MY ENEMY PAUL OLBRICH A YEAR AFTER THE WAR HAD ENDED
HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
DURING THE YEARS THAT HAVE GONE I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOU FOR IN YOUR WRITINGS I READ PLAINLY HOW SOURED AND EMBITTERED YOU HAD BECOME AND WHERE IS ORANMORE DEAD
FOR ON TURNING SHARPLY MY EYES SUDDENLY DETECTED SOME INDISTINCT OBJECT
WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
