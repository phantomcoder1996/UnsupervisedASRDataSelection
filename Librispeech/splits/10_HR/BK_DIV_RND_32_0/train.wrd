ALL THE IMPOSSIBILITIES AND THE STONE WALL NOT TO BE RECONCILED TO ONE OF THOSE IMPOSSIBILITIES AND STONE WALLS IF IT DISGUSTS YOU TO BE RECONCILED TO IT BY THE WAY OF THE MOST INEVITABLE LOGICAL COMBINATIONS
LOOK AT IT WHICH WAY ONE WILL IT STILL TURNS OUT THAT I WAS ALWAYS THE MOST TO BLAME IN EVERYTHING AND WHAT IS MOST HUMILIATING OF ALL TO BLAME FOR NO FAULT OF MY OWN BUT SO TO SAY THROUGH THE LAWS OF NATURE
AND IF WE REALLY ASPIRE TO FORMULAS AND TABLES OF RULES AND WELL EVEN TO THE CHEMICAL RETORT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT WE MUST ACCEPT THE RETORT TOO OR ELSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT OUR CONSENT
EVERY SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN FACT IS A DISEASE I STICK TO THAT LET US LEAVE THAT TOO FOR A MINUTE TELL ME THIS WHY DOES IT HAPPEN THAT AT THE VERY YES AT THE VERY MOMENTS
OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
ONLY TO GAIN HIS POINT HE WILL LAUNCH A CURSE UPON THE WORLD AND AS ONLY MAN CAN CURSE IT IS HIS PRIVILEGE THE PRIMARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIM AND OTHER ANIMALS MAY BE BY HIS CURSE ALONE HE WILL ATTAIN HIS OBJECT
I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BECOME ANYTHING NEITHER SPITEFUL NOR KIND NEITHER A RASCAL NOR AN HONEST MAN NEITHER A HERO NOR AN INSECT NOW I AM LIVING OUT MY LIFE IN MY CORNER
IT MAY BE AN ACUTELY CONSCIOUS MOUSE YET IT IS A MOUSE
I WAS CONSCIOUS EVERY MOMENT IN MYSELF OF MANY VERY MANY ELEMENTS ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE TO THAT I FELT THEM POSITIVELY SWARMING IN ME THESE OPPOSITE ELEMENTS I KNEW THAT THEY HAD BEEN SWARMING IN ME ALL MY LIFE AND CRAVING SOME OUTLET FROM ME
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
WHAT DOES REASON KNOW REASON ONLY KNOWS WHAT IT HAS SUCCEEDED IN LEARNING SOME THINGS PERHAPS IT WILL NEVER LEARN THIS IS A POOR COMFORT BUT WHY NOT SAY SO FRANKLY AND HUMAN NATURE ACTS AS A WHOLE WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS IN IT
AND DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT AILS ME I DON'T CONSULT A DOCTOR FOR IT AND NEVER HAVE THOUGH I HAVE A RESPECT FOR MEDICINE AND DOCTORS BESIDES I AM EXTREMELY SUPERSTITIOUS SUFFICIENTLY SO TO RESPECT MEDICINE ANYWAY
THE MOUSE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE JUSTICE OF IT TO COME AT LAST TO THE DEED ITSELF TO THE VERY ACT OF REVENGE APART FROM THE ONE FUNDAMENTAL NASTINESS THE LUCKLESS MOUSE SUCCEEDS IN CREATING AROUND IT
IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
A LIGHT TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS SIMPLY IN ORDER TO SHOW THEM THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO LIVE MORALLY AND RATIONALLY IN THIS WORLD AND YET WE ALL KNOW THAT THOSE VERY PEOPLE SOONER OR LATER HAVE BEEN FALSE TO THEMSELVES PLAYING SOME QUEER TRICK
PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
THAT IS THE DIRECT PERSONS AND MEN OF ACTION ARE GENUINELY NONPLUSSED FOR THEM A WALL IS NOT AN EVASION AS FOR US PEOPLE WHO THINK AND CONSEQUENTLY DO NOTHING
OFTEN A MOST UNSEEMLY ONE NOW I ASK YOU WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF MAN SINCE HE IS A BEING ENDOWED WITH STRANGE QUALITIES SHOWER UPON HIM EVERY EARTHLY BLESSING
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
OUR CHOICE IS USUALLY MISTAKEN FROM A FALSE VIEW OF OUR ADVANTAGE WE SOMETIMES CHOOSE ABSOLUTE NONSENSE BECAUSE IN OUR FOOLISHNESS WE SEE IN THAT NONSENSE THE EASIEST MEANS FOR ATTAINING A SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE
I WANT NOW TO TELL YOU GENTLEMEN WHETHER YOU CARE TO HEAR IT OR NOT WHY I COULD NOT EVEN BECOME AN INSECT I TELL YOU SOLEMNLY THAT I HAVE MANY TIMES TRIED TO BECOME AN INSECT BUT I WAS NOT EQUAL EVEN TO THAT I SWEAR GENTLEMEN
BUT SET YOUR MINDS AT REST GENTLEMEN I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A SLAP IN THE FACE THOUGH IT IS ABSOLUTELY A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME WHAT YOU MAY THINK ABOUT IT POSSIBLY I EVEN REGRET MYSELF THAT I HAVE GIVEN SO FEW SLAPS IN THE FACE DURING MY LIFE
SOME YOU SEE MAINTAIN THAT THIS REALLY IS THE MOST PRECIOUS THING FOR MANKIND CHOICE CAN OF COURSE IF IT CHOOSES BE IN AGREEMENT WITH REASON AND ESPECIALLY IF THIS BE NOT ABUSED BUT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
BUT AM NO LONGER I WAS A SPITEFUL OFFICIAL I WAS RUDE AND TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING SO I DID NOT TAKE BRIBES YOU SEE SO I WAS BOUND TO FIND A RECOMPENSE IN THAT AT LEAST A POOR JEST BUT I WILL NOT SCRATCH IT OUT
I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
YES BUT HERE I COME TO A STOP GENTLEMEN YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR BEING OVER PHILOSOPHICAL IT'S THE RESULT OF FORTY YEARS UNDERGROUND ALLOW ME TO INDULGE MY FANCY
OF OUR UNHAPPY NINETEENTH CENTURY ESPECIALLY ONE WHO HAS THE FATAL ILL LUCK TO INHABIT PETERSBURG THE MOST THEORETICAL AND INTENTIONAL TOWN ON THE WHOLE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THERE ARE INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL TOWNS
USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS MY NORMAL CONDITION BUT AT FIRST IN THE BEGINNING WHAT AGONIES I ENDURED IN THAT STRUGGLE I DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL MY LIFE I HID THIS FACT ABOUT MYSELF AS A SECRET
BUT WHEN ALL THAT IS EXPLAINED AND WORKED OUT ON PAPER WHICH IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR IT IS CONTEMPTIBLE AND SENSELESS TO SUPPOSE THAT SOME LAWS OF NATURE MAN WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THEN CERTAINLY SO CALLED DESIRES WILL NO LONGER EXIST
IF FOR INSTANCE SOME DAY THEY CALCULATE AND PROVE TO ME THAT I MADE A LONG NOSE AT SOMEONE BECAUSE I COULD NOT HELP MAKING A LONG NOSE AT HIM AND THAT I HAD TO DO IT IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY WHAT FREEDOM IS LEFT ME
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
THIS PERSON INTRODUCES HIMSELF AND HIS VIEWS AND AS IT WERE TRIES TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSES OWING TO WHICH HE HAS MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND WAS BOUND TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE IN OUR MIDST IN THE SECOND FRAGMENT
I HAVE ALL MY LIFE AS IT WERE TURNED MY EYES AWAY AND NEVER COULD LOOK PEOPLE STRAIGHT IN THE FACE TO BLAME FINALLY BECAUSE EVEN IF I HAD HAD MAGNANIMITY I SHOULD ONLY HAVE HAD MORE SUFFERING FROM THE SENSE OF ITS USELESSNESS
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
IT WILL INVENT UNHEARD OF THINGS AGAINST ITSELF PRETENDING THAT THOSE THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN AND WILL FORGIVE NOTHING MAYBE IT WILL BEGIN TO REVENGE ITSELF TOO BUT AS IT WERE PIECEMEAL IN TRIVIAL WAYS FROM BEHIND THE STOVE
AND THE WORST OF IT IS HE HIMSELF HIS VERY OWN SELF LOOKS ON HIMSELF AS A MOUSE NO ONE ASKS HIM TO DO SO AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT NOW LET US LOOK AT THIS MOUSE IN ACTION LET US SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE
AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
DROWN HIM IN A SEA OF HAPPINESS SO THAT NOTHING BUT BUBBLES OF BLISS CAN BE SEEN ON THE SURFACE GIVE HIM ECONOMIC PROSPERITY SUCH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT SLEEP EAT CAKES AND BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE CONTINUATION OF HIS SPECIES
HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
WOULD STOP IT ALL AND REASON WOULD REASSERT ITSELF THEN MAN WOULD PURPOSELY GO MAD IN ORDER TO BE RID OF REASON AND GAIN HIS POINT I BELIEVE IN IT I ANSWER FOR IT
I AM AS SUSPICIOUS AND PRONE TO TAKE OFFENCE AS A HUMPBACK OR A DWARF BUT UPON MY WORD I SOMETIMES HAVE HAD MOMENTS WHEN IF I HAD HAPPENED TO BE SLAPPED IN THE FACE I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY GLAD OF IT I SAY
BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
BECAUSE PERHAPS IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR YOU TO CHANGE INTO AND THE WORST OF IT WAS AND THE ROOT OF IT ALL THAT IT WAS ALL IN ACCORD WITH THE NORMAL FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF OVER ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS
THIS RETORT MADE MAN IS SOMETIMES SO NONPLUSSED IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ANTITHESIS THAT WITH ALL HIS EXAGGERATED CONSCIOUSNESS HE GENUINELY THINKS OF HIMSELF AS A MOUSE AND NOT A MAN
AND SO ON AND SO ON MERCIFUL HEAVENS BUT WHAT DO I CARE FOR THE LAWS OF NATURE AND ARITHMETIC WHEN FOR SOME REASON I DISLIKE THOSE LAWS AND THE FACT THAT TWICE TWO MAKES FOUR OF COURSE I CANNOT BREAK THROUGH THE WALL BY BATTERING MY HEAD AGAINST IT
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
HOW THEY DEVELOP WHAT THEY ARE AIMING AT IN ONE CASE AND IN ANOTHER AND SO ON THAT IS A REAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULA THEN MOST LIKELY MAN WILL AT ONCE CEASE TO FEEL DESIRE INDEED HE WILL BE CERTAIN TO FOR WHO WOULD WANT TO CHOOSE BY RULE
HA HA HA BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHOICE IN REALITY SAY WHAT YOU LIKE YOU WILL INTERPOSE WITH A CHUCKLE SCIENCE HAS SUCCEEDED IN SO FAR ANALYSING MAN THAT WE KNOW ALREADY THAT CHOICE AND WHAT IS CALLED FREEDOM OF WILL IS NOTHING ELSE THAN
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
THAT I AM EXPRESSING REMORSE FOR SOMETHING NOW THAT I AM ASKING YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR SOMETHING I AM SURE YOU ARE FANCYING THAT HOWEVER I ASSURE YOU I DO NOT CARE IF YOU ARE IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT I COULD NOT BECOME SPITEFUL
CAN ONE HELP BEING TEMPTED TO REJOICE THAT IT HAS NOT YET COME OFF AND THAT DESIRE STILL DEPENDS ON SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW YOU WILL SCREAM AT ME THAT IS IF YOU CONDESCEND TO DO SO THAT NO ONE IS TOUCHING MY FREE WILL
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
IT IS PROFITABLE AND SOMETIMES EVEN PRAISEWORTHY BUT VERY OFTEN AND EVEN MOST OFTEN CHOICE IS UTTERLY AND STUBBORNLY OPPOSED TO REASON AND AND DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT TOO IS PROFITABLE
LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
AND ALL SUCH PREJUDICES AND FANCIES THEN YOU HAVE JUST TO ACCEPT IT THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT FOR TWICE TWO IS A LAW OF MATHEMATICS JUST TRY REFUTING IT UPON MY WORD THEY WILL SHOUT AT YOU IT IS NO USE PROTESTING
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
CANNOT CONSCIOUSLY DESIRE ANYTHING DISADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CAN BE PROVED MATHEMATICALLY I THOROUGHLY AGREE IT CAN BY MATHEMATICS BUT I REPEAT FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME THERE IS ONE CASE ONE ONLY
FOR THE WHOLE WORK OF MAN REALLY SEEMS TO CONSIST IN NOTHING BUT PROVING TO HIMSELF EVERY MINUTE THAT HE IS A MAN AND NOT A PIANO KEY IT MAY BE AT THE COST OF HIS SKIN IT MAY BE BY CANNIBALISM AND THIS BEING SO
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
IN THAT HELL OF UNSATISFIED DESIRES TURNED INWARD IN THAT FEVER OF OSCILLATIONS OF RESOLUTIONS DETERMINED FOR EVER AND REPENTED OF AGAIN A MINUTE LATER THAT THE SAVOUR OF THAT STRANGE ENJOYMENT OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN LIES
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
OF COURSE THIS VERY STUPID THING THIS CAPRICE OF OURS MAY BE IN REALITY GENTLEMEN MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN CASES AND IN PARTICULAR IT MAY BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN ANY ADVANTAGE
IRRITATED BY ALL THIS BABBLE AND I FEEL THAT YOU ARE IRRITATED YOU THINK FIT TO ASK ME WHO I AM THEN MY ANSWER IS I AM A COLLEGIATE ASSESSOR I WAS IN THE SERVICE THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT AND SOLELY FOR THAT REASON
THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
AND AS ALL CHOICE AND REASONING CAN BE REALLY CALCULATED BECAUSE THERE WILL SOME DAY BE DISCOVERED THE LAWS OF OUR SO CALLED FREE WILL SO JOKING APART THERE MAY ONE DAY BE SOMETHING LIKE A TABLE CONSTRUCTED OF THEM SO THAT WE REALLY SHALL CHOOSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
THE MOST UNECONOMICAL ABSURDITY SIMPLY TO INTRODUCE INTO ALL THIS POSITIVE GOOD SENSE HIS FATAL FANTASTIC ELEMENT IT IS JUST HIS FANTASTIC DREAMS HIS VULGAR FOLLY THAT HE WILL DESIRE TO RETAIN
I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
I AM FORTY YEARS OLD NOW AND YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS IS A WHOLE LIFETIME YOU KNOW IT IS EXTREME OLD AGE TO LIVE LONGER THAN FORTY YEARS IS BAD MANNERS IS VULGAR IMMORAL WHO DOES LIVE BEYOND FORTY ANSWER THAT
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
BUT STILL IF I DON'T CONSULT A DOCTOR IT IS FROM SPITE MY LIVER IS BAD WELL LET IT GET WORSE I HAVE BEEN GOING ON LIKE THAT FOR A LONG TIME TWENTY YEARS NOW I AM FORTY I USED TO BE IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE
THE PROFESSOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY IN MY DIRECTION AND SEEMED TO LOOK THROUGH AND THROUGH ME WITHOUT SEEING ME THEN WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO HE SAID THERE ISN'T ANYBODY HERE YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE OTHER PROFESSOR AND HE ISN'T HERE HE ADDED WILDLY TURNING ROUND AND ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM
IT IS NOT QUITE CONVENIENT THE FOURTH ARRIVED AND PUNCTUAL PAUL CAME WITH HIS LEGAL FRIEND AT NOON I THOUGHT IT BEST SAID HE TO CALL ONE CANNOT SETTLE THINGS TOO SOON POOR PETER SHUDDERED IN DESPAIR
THE PARTY IN THE DRAWING ROOM I HAD WALKED STRAIGHT IN YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT RINGING THE BELL OR GIVING ANY NOTICE OF MY APPROACH CONSISTED OF FOUR LAUGHING ROSY CHILDREN OF AGES FROM ABOUT FOURTEEN DOWN TO TEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ALL COMING TOWARDS THE DOOR
BLOW AFTER BLOW
LESS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD SHOW IT BY SUCH WILD DANCES SUCH CRAZY SONGS
HERE HE DARTED ABOUT PEN IN HAND FROM ONE PART OF THE SCROLL TO ANOTHER SPREADING SHEETS OF BLOTTING PAPER OVER HIS CORRECTIONS
ALL OF US EXCEPT SYLVIE AND BRUNO WHO TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON FOLLOWED HER TO THE WINDOW THE OLD BEGGAR LOOKED UP AT US WITH HUNGRY EYES
THE PROFESSOR BEGAN IN A TREMBLING TONE
SHORT PARTINGS ARE BEST SAID THE WARDEN ALL IS READY FOR MY JOURNEY MY CHILDREN ARE WAITING BELOW TO SEE ME OFF HE GRAVELY KISSED MY LADY SHOOK HANDS WITH HIS BROTHER AND THE CHANCELLOR
BUT I HOPE THERE ARE NO SNAKES ABOUT I MUSED ALOUD TAKING MY SEAT ON A FALLEN TREE I CERTAINLY DO NOT LIKE SNAKES AND I DON'T SUPPOSE BRUNO LIKES THEM EITHER
A DISCORDANT VOICE YELLED IN OUR EARS WERE
I'LL ASK THE GARDENER TO LET US OUT AGAIN
WHEN AT LAST THE DRESS WAS UNFOLDED
BRUNO WAS AT THE WINDOW TRYING TO THROW OUT HIS SLICE OF PLUM CAKE BUT SYLVIE HELD HIM BACK
HE'S NOT HUNGRY BUT WE WANT TO SEE HIM SO WILL YOU PLEASE
THIS DEBT WILL SIMPLY SWALLOW ALL AND MAKE MY LIFE A LIFE OF WOE NAY NAY NAY PETER ANSWERED PAUL YOU MUST NOT RAIL ON FORTUNE SO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK YOU ARE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD
PLEASE I'M SYLVIE AND WHO'S THAT OTHER THING SAID THE GARDENER WHAT THING SAID SYLVIE LOOKING ROUND OH THAT'S BRUNO HE'S MY BROTHER
THE ACCIDENT I WAS IMAGINING OCCURRED A LIGHT CART WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MILLINERY DEPOT OF ELVESTON LADEN WITH CARD BOARD PACKING CASES WHICH THE DRIVER WAS CARRYING INTO THE SHOP ONE BY ONE
AND THEN MADE HER DECISION IT'S VERY NICE TO BE LOVED SHE SAID BUT IT'S NICER TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE
AND WINKED AT HER AND PUT HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK IS THAT THE SORT OF THING NOW HE DEMANDED MY LADY'S EYES FLASHED WITH ALL A CONSPIRATOR'S ENTHUSIASM
THE VICE WARDEN INTERRUPTED YOUR POSITION AS COURT PROFESSOR MAKES IT AWKWARD I ADMIT
SYLVIE CONSIDERED A LITTLE NOT TO DAY SHE REPLIED WE HAVEN'T GOT THE THINGS READY WE'LL COME ON TUESDAY NEXT IF YOU LIKE
A BEAR BUT NOT WITHOUT A HEAD I HOPE
AND A COURT JESTER THE VICE WARDEN AND HIS WIFE SHOOK WITH WELL ACTED MERRIMENT NOT IN THIS ROOM DARLING SAID THE FOND MOTHER
WHAT'S ALL THIS NOISE ABOUT THE VICE WARDEN ANGRILY ENQUIRED AS HE STRODE INTO THE ROOM AND WHO PUT THE HAT STAND HERE AND HE HUNG HIS HAT UP ON BRUNO
AND GLAD ENOUGH TO SETTLE DOWN AGAIN INTO THE EASY CHAIR WHILE ARTHUR HOSPITABLY WENT TO HIS CUPBOARD TO GET ME OUT SOME CAKE AND WINE WITHOUT WHICH HE DECLARED HE COULD NOT AS A DOCTOR PERMIT MY GOING TO BED
AT HOME LAWN TENNIS THREE P M AT HOME KETTLEDRUM FIVE P M AT HOME MUSIC ELVESTON DOESN'T GIVE DINNERS EIGHT P M CARRIAGES AT TEN THERE YOU ARE IT SOUNDED VERY PLEASANT I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT
THAT IS THEIR DESTINY I SEE IT BUT I CANNOT ALTER IT THE SELFISHNESS OF A MEAN AND CRAFTY MAN THE SELFISHNESS OF AN AMBITIOUS AND SILLY WOMAN THE SELFISHNESS OF A SPITEFUL AND LOVELESS CHILD
AND IF ANY ONE KNOWS US THEY'LL HAVE SHARP EYES THAT'S ALL
I INSIST UPON KNOWING MY LADY CAST DOWN HER EYES AND SPOKE IN THE LITTLEST OF LITTLE VOICES
BRUNO CRIED PASSIONATELY STRUGGLING OUT OF SYLVIE'S ARMS YES
HE REMARKED EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT BUT MY LADY WOULD NOT BE CHECKED HE IS A CLEVER BOY SHE CONTINUED WITH ENTHUSIASM BUT HE NEEDS A MAN LIKE YOUR LORDSHIP TO DRAW HIM OUT THE CHANCELLOR BIT HIS LIP
THEY COULDN'T WELTER IN GORE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES WELTERING IN GORE IS A VERY EXPRESSIVE PHRASE CERTAINLY CAN IT BE DONE IN ANY FLUID I WONDER
HIS FLOWING LOCKS HE WILDLY TORE AND VERY SOON HIS YELLOW HAIR WAS LYING ALL ABOUT THE FLOOR THE LEGAL FRIEND WAS STANDING BY WITH SUDDEN PITY HALF UNMANNED THE TEAR DROP TREMBLED IN HIS EYE THE SIGNED AGREEMENT IN HIS HAND
THEIR MOTHER SAID COME THAT'S DONE AT LAST YOU MAY FOLD UP YOUR WORK GIRLS BUT THE CHILDREN TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE REMARK ON THE CONTRARY THEY SET TO WORK AT ONCE SEWING IF THAT IS THE PROPER WORD TO DESCRIBE AN OPERATION SUCH AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED
WITH A LARGE EXTINGUISHER OVER IT THE PROFESSOR MILDLY EXPLAINED THAT HIS HIGHNESS HAD BEEN GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO SAY HE WOULDN'T DO HIS LESSONS
COMMON CHILDREN SYLVIE THOUGHTFULLY REPLIED THAT'S THE EASIEST SIZE TO MANAGE COULD YOU COME TO DAY I SAID THINKING THEN WE COULD HAVE YOU AT THE PICNIC
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT A POST IN INDIA THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED ME
THEN IT WOULD TAKE EVER SO MUCH LONGER OF COURSE IN FACT I DOUBT IF THE MAN HIMSELF WOULD EVER FEEL IT AT ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN MIGHT I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE THE GRANDCHILD OF A PINCHED GRANDFATHER WOULD YOU MISTER SIR BRUNO WHISPERED IT MIGHT COME JUST WHEN YOU WANTED TO BE HAPPY
BUT I CAN TRUST YOU WITH A SECRET OLD FRIEND YES IT'S TRUE OF ME WHAT I SUPPOSE YOU SAID IN JEST IN THE MEREST JEST BELIEVE ME I SAID EARNESTLY WHY MAN I'M THREE TIMES HER AGE
ALL THIS TIME THE SUB WARDEN WAS BUSY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S HELP SHIFTING THE PAPERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND POINTING OUT TO THE WARDEN THE PLACE WHEW HE WAS TO SIGN HE THEN SIGNED IT HIMSELF AND MY LADY AND THE CHANCELLOR ADDED THEIR NAMES AS WITNESSES
IN FACT HE CLIMBED UP INTO SYLVIE'S LAP AS HE SPOKE AND RESTED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER SHOULDER
THUNDERED THE VICE WARDEN AND TAKE THIS AND A RESOUNDING BOX ON THE EAR MADE THE UNFORTUNATE PROFESSOR REEL ACROSS THE ROOM
SNEERED HIS EXCELLENCY WE'VE ONLY GOT TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK HE'S DEAD
LIKE THAT AND THEY COME OUT OH EVER SO LONG ONCE BRUNO BEGAN AGAIN SYLVIE AND ME WRITED
BUT THERE'S A HEART WITHIN THIS BREAST AND I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE NOT SO WAS PETER'S MILD REPLY HIS CHEEKS ALL WET WITH GRATEFUL TEARS NO MAN RECALLS SO WELL AS I YOUR SERVICES IN BYGONE YEARS
WELL DONE MY BOY CRIED THE VICE WARDEN THAT'S THE WAY TO SETTLE SUCH FOLK
I MOVED AWAY A FEW STEPS AND WAITED TO FOLLOW HER INTO THE CARRIAGE WHERE I RESUMED THE CONVERSATION
IT'S FOR YOU TO KEEP YOU KNOW HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE NOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE YOU'LL REMEMBER HOW TO USE IT YES I'LL REMEMBER SAID SYLVIE AND NOW DARLINGS IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO BACK OR THEY'LL BE MISSING YOU AND THEN THAT POOR GARDENER WILL GET INTO TROUBLE
THE PROFESSOR CAUTIOUSLY PRODUCED A COUPLE OF SHILLINGS THAT'LL DO IT THE GARDENER SHOUTED AS HE HURLED THE WATERING CAN ACROSS THE FLOWER BED AND PRODUCED A HANDFUL OF KEYS ONE LARGE ONE AND A NUMBER OF SMALL ONES
AND NOW REALLY BRUNO YOU MUST COME AND DO YOUR LESSONS
AND SYLVIE AND BRUNO CAME IN WITH THEIR ARMS TWINED LOVINGLY ROUND EACH OTHER BRUNO SOBBING CONVULSIVELY WITH HIS FACE HIDDEN ON HIS SISTER'S SHOULDER AND SYLVIE MORE GRAVE AND QUIET
THOUGH HOW I MANAGED TO KEEP UP WITH A CANTERING LION I AM WHOLLY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN BUT I WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHEN WE CAME UPON AN OLD BEGGAR MAN CUTTING STICKS AT WHOSE FEET
THE LION MADE A PROFOUND OBEISANCE SYLVIE AND BRUNO AT THE SAME MOMENT DISMOUNTING AND LEAPING IN TO THE ARMS OF THEIR FATHER
AND HE THREW HIS ARMS ROUND HER NECK FOR THIS NOVEL BUT APPARENTLY NOT VERY PAINFUL OPERATION IT'S VERY LIKE KISSING SYLVIE REMARKED
DO GET HIM TO COME AND DON'T FORGET THE DAY TUESDAY WEEK WE CAN DRIVE YOU OVER IT WOULD BE A PITY TO GO BY RAIL THERE IS SO MUCH PRETTY SCENERY ON THE ROAD
IN MAKING THINGS INTO HEAPS WHICH NO DOUBT YOU OFTEN DO
BUT YOU LIKE A DOG WHEN IT WAGS ITS TAIL SYLVIE INTERRUPTED
AS HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LOCKET NOW SYLVIE LOOK AT THIS AND HE SHOWED HER LYING ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND A LOCKET OF A DEEP CRIMSON COLOUR THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BLUE ONE AND LIKE IT ATTACHED TO A SLENDER GOLDEN CHAIN LOVELIER AND LOVELIER EXCLAIMED SYLVIE
AND SHOWED THE TWO PARCHMENTS LYING SIDE BY SIDE THIS IS THE ONE HE READ BUT DIDN'T SIGN AND THIS IS THE ONE HE SIGNED BUT DIDN'T READ
AND SO THE WORK WENT ON STEADILY UNDOING ITSELF AND THE NEATLY STITCHED LITTLE DRESSES OR WHATEVER THEY WERE STEADILY FALLING TO PIECES NOW AND THEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN WOULD PAUSE AS THE RECOVERED THREAD BECAME INCONVENIENTLY LONG WIND IT ON A BOBBIN
IT WOULD NEVER LEAVE IT FOR THAT WOULD BE TO GET AHEAD OF IT IN THE RACE AND IT COULD NEVER OVERTAKE THE FAILING FLOOR
AND MAKING ROOM AMONG THEM FOR THE ONE THE WARDEN HAD JUST HANDED TO HIM THESE ARE MERELY THE ROUGH COPIES HE EXPLAINED AND AS SOON AS I HAVE PUT IN THE FINAL CORRECTIONS MAKING A GREAT COMMOTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT PARCHMENTS A SEMI COLON OR TWO THAT I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED
AND TOOK THE SEAWARD ROAD THAT LED TO MY LODGINGS THE GOOD I FANCIED I COULD DO IS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM THE EVIL OF THIS TROUBLESOME WORLD IS THE ONLY ABIDING REALITY
RARELY MET WITH EXCEPT BETWEEN VERY OLD FRIENDS AND AS I KNEW THAT THEY HAD NOT KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAN THE SUMMER WHICH WAS NOW ROUNDING INTO AUTUMN I FELT CERTAIN THAT LOVE
HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT THAT PRACTISED ON A FIFE HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE AT LENGTH I REALISE HE SAID THE BITTERNESS OF LIFE AND WHAT A WILD BEING IT WAS WHO SANG THESE WILD WORDS
WASTING NO TIME OVER PRELIMINARIES THE SUB WARDENSHIP IS ABOLISHED AND MY BROTHER IS APPOINTED TO ACT AS VICE WARDEN WHENEVER I AM ABSENT
BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELONG TO ELFLAND YET BUT TO ME THEY ARE REAL BRUNO LOOKED PUZZLED I'LL TRY ANUVVER KIND OF FRUITS HE SAID AND JUMPED DOWN OFF THE KING'S KNEE THERE'S SOME LOVELY STRIPED ONES JUST LIKE A RAINBOW AND OFF HE RAN
WHAT SIZE WILL YOU BE I ENQUIRED
ONE OF THE CASES HAD FALLEN INTO THE STREET BUT IT SCARCELY SEEMED WORTH WHILE TO STEP FORWARD AND PICK IT UP AS THE MAN WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN A MOMENT YET IN THAT MOMENT A YOUNG MAN RIDING A BICYCLE CAME SHARP ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET
I SUPPOSE NOW THAT WORD ITEM HAS SOME DEEP LEGAL MEANING UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED THE CHANCELLOR AS ARTICULATELY AS HE COULD WITH A PEN BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE WAS NERVOUSLY ROLLING AND UNROLLING SEVERAL OTHER SCROLLS
BRUNO SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND BEGAN CRYING HE IS SO CRUEL HE SOBBED
AND IS FIVE O'CLOCK TEA TO BE GOING ON ALL THE WHILE SAID LADY MURIEL THAT AND OTHER THINGS SAID ARTHUR THE INHABITANTS WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES GROW UP AND DIE
WAS VERY SOOTHING FOR WHATEVER REMAINS OF PERSONAL VANITY THE FAILURES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS OF MANY LONG YEARS AND MUCH BUFFETING WITH A ROUGH WORLD HAD LEFT IN ME YET I NOTED AND WAS GLAD TO NOTE
THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU ARE ACTING BY RULE HE EXPLAINED IN OPENING THE DOOR FOR ME AND NOW IT'S OPEN WE ARE GOING OUT BY RULE THE RULE OF THREE THE GARDENER LOOKED PUZZLED AND LET US GO OUT
IT'LL DO NO HARM AND WHEN
MY LADY WRUNG HER HANDS
BRING DOCTOR FORESTER WITH YOU I'M SURE A DAY IN THE COUNTRY WOULD DO HIM GOOD I'M AFRAID HE STUDIES TOO MUCH
I STOOD WATCHING THE UNLOADING OF THE CART STILL HOLDING THE MAGIC WATCH OPEN IN MY HAND AS I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE AGAIN REACHED THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH I HAD PUT BACK THE HAND
THEN HEARING MY FOOTSTEPS TO LOOK UP AND SEE ME AND THEN TO WONDER WHAT BUSINESS I HAD THERE WOULD BE REVERSED BY THE ACTION OF MY WATCH THEY WOULD FIRST WONDER WHO I WAS THEN SEE ME THEN LOOK DOWN AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT ME AND AS TO BEING EXPELLED WITH VIOLENCE
TAKE A STICK TO HIM SHOUTED THE VICE WARDEN AS THE OLD BEGGAR SHOOK THE WATER FROM HIS RAGGED CLOAK AND AGAIN GAZED MEEKLY UPWARDS
AND IN TRYING TO AVOID RUNNING OVER THE BOX UPSET HIS MACHINE AND WAS THROWN HEADLONG AGAINST THE WHEEL OF THE SPRING CART THE DRIVER RAN OUT TO HIS ASSISTANCE AND HE AND I TOGETHER RAISED THE UNFORTUNATE CYCLIST AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE SHOP
MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO ME THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THOSE WORDS TILL NOW THE NEXT FEW DAYS PASSED WEARILY ENOUGH I FELT NO INCLINATION TO CALL BY MYSELF AT THE HALL STILL LESS TO PROPOSE THAT ARTHUR SHOULD GO WITH ME
TAKE CARE SYLVIE ANXIOUSLY EXCLAIMED AS HE BEGAN RATHER CLUMSILY TO POINT IT YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGER OFF IF YOU HOLD THE KNIFE SO IF OO CUTS IT OFF WILL OO GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE BRUNO THOUGHTFULLY ADDED
BUT AS HE LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND US WE HEARD HIM SINGING THOUGHTFULLY TO HIMSELF HE THOUGHT HE SAW A GARDEN DOOR THAT OPENED WITH A KEY HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A DOUBLE RULE OF THREE
THIS STYLE OF BUSINESS SEEMS TO ME EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT NO NOBLENESS OF SOUL HAVE I LIKE SOME THAT IN THIS AGE ARE FOUND
TILL WHAT IS DARK BE LIGHT TILL WHAT IS WRONG
HE SIGHED TO FIND THE STATE OF THINGS GROW LESS AND LESS CONVENIENT WEEKS GREW TO MONTHS AND MONTHS TO YEARS PETER WAS WORN TO SKIN AND BONE
HOWEVER THE PARTY WITH THE ADDITION OF A GENTLEMAN AS GOOD NATURED AND AS ROSY AS THE CHILDREN SEATED THEMSELVES AT IT VERY CONTENTEDLY YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE EATING CHERRY TART AND EVERY NOW AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY CONVEYING A CHERRY STONE FROM THEIR LIPS TO THEIR PLATES
AND SYLVIE SETS ME SOME LESSONS THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY YOU DON'T LIKE LESSONS I SAID YOU SHOULD COPY SYLVIE SHE'S ALWAYS AS BUSY AS THE DAY IS LONG
I FEEL INCLINED TO SAY WITH ALEXANDER SELKIRK
I PICTURED THEM TO MYSELF WALKING TOGETHER LINGERINGLY AND LOVINGLY UNDER ARCHING TREES IN A SWEET GARDEN OF THEIR OWN AND WELCOMED BACK BY THEIR FAITHFUL GARDENER ON THEIR RETURN FROM SOME BRIEF EXCURSION
RESOLVED TO GUARD THE TREASURE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND A FRONT DOOR STANDING INVITINGLY HALF OPEN HERE IS MY CHANCE I THOUGHT FOR TESTING THE REVERSE ACTION OF THE MAGIC WATCH I PRESSED THE REVERSAL PEG AND WALKED IN
AND HE BEGAN TROTTING ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM LIFTING UP THE CHAIRS AND SHAKING THEM BRUNO TOOK A VERY SMALL BOOK OUT OF THE BOOKCASE OPENED IT AND SHOOK IT IN IMITATION OF THE PROFESSOR HE ISN'T HERE HE SAID
PAUL BUSTLED IN TO HAVE A CHAT AND GRASPED HIS HAND WITH FRIENDLY ZEAL I KNEW SAID HE YOUR FRUGAL WAYS SO THAT I MIGHT NOT WOUND YOUR PRIDE BY BRINGING STRANGERS IN TO GAZE I'VE LEFT MY LEGAL FRIEND OUTSIDE
THE PROFESSOR LEFT HIS DISTINGUISHED PUPIL STANDING AT THE DOOR AND MEEKLY RETURNED THERE IS A RUMOUR AFLOAT THAT THE PEOPLE WISH TO ELECT AN
AND I KNOW SOME OF THE LADY SOCIETY ALREADY I ADDED ONE OF THEM CAME IN THE SAME CARRIAGE WITH ME WHAT WAS SHE LIKE THEN PERHAPS I CAN IDENTIFY HER THE NAME WAS LADY MURIEL ORME
HERE THE PROFESSOR INTERFERED AS THE OTHER PROFESSOR WAS EVIDENTLY TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO GO ON WITH HIS DIAGRAM WHEN I SAID IT WOULD HURT HIM I WAS MERELY REFERRING TO THE ACTION OF THE NERVES THE OTHER PROFESSOR BRIGHTENED UP IN A MOMENT
AND WE THEREFORE ENTREAT YOU GRACIOUSLY TO ACCEPT THE KINGSHIP
IN A HANDSOME LIVERY CAME FORWARDS AND RESPECTFULLY TOUCHED HIS HAT THE CARRIAGE IS HERE MY LADY HE SAID TAKING FROM HER THE WRAPS AND SMALL ARTICLES SHE WAS CARRYING
BUT THE PRINCESS FELT IT AND THEN SHE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
AND DETERMINED TO LAY SIEGE TO THE FLOWER QUEEN'S PALACE BUT THE QUEEN CAUSED A FOREST OF FLOWERS AS HIGH AS THE SKY TO GROW UP ROUND HER DWELLING THROUGH WHICH NO ONE COULD FORCE A WAY
THEY CAME BELLOWING TO MEET HIM ONE OF THEM WAS TREMENDOUSLY BIG THE OTHER RATHER LESS RING GREW TERRIBLY AFRAID HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM ASKED SNATI NOT WELL AT ALL
THEN THE PRINCESS COULD RESTRAIN HERSELF NO LONGER BUT RAN FORWARD AND THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER HUSBAND AND IMMEDIATELY HE KNEW HER AGAIN AND SAID DO YOU REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU THAT DAY THAT YOU WOULD BETRAY ME NOW YOU SEE THAT I SPOKE THE TRUTH
AND HOW HE HAD HEARD FROM HIS OWN LIPS THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE THEN THEY WERE ALL DELIGHTED AND IN HIGH SPIRITS TOOK OUT THEIR WHIP AND CRACKED SO MUCH MONEY THAT IT CAME JUMPING UP FROM THE GROUND WHEN THE SEVEN YEARS HAD QUITE GONE THE FIEND CAME WITH HIS BOOK AND
AND ANOTHER SAID A HEALTH TO MY MOTHER AND SO THE HEALTHS WENT ROUND THEN ONE OF THEM SAID A HEALTH TO MY DEAREST LADY LONG MAY SHE LIVE AND WELL BUT A CURSE ON THE CRUEL MOTHER THAT BURNT MY GOLDEN SHELL
NOW HE CERTAINLY BELIEVED THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FOR HIMSELF BUT HE WANTED FIRST TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE IN ORDER TO SEE HOW HE STOOD WITH REGARD TO HIS OFFICE EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE TOWN KNEW WHAT A WONDERFUL POWER THE CLOTH HAD
SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
THE QUEENLY ROBES OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES WHICH ARE LIKE THE FLOWERY MEADOWS AND BRING THEM BOTH TO ME
THEN HE GAZED BENEATH HIM AND WHAT A SIGHT MET HIS EYES A YAWNING ABYSS WITH CERTAIN AND TERRIBLE DEATH AT THE BOTTOM REEKING WITH HALF DECAYED BODIES OF HORSES AND RIDERS
BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
NOW I HAVE HIDDEN THEM IN THE APPLE TREE HIDE YOURSELF THERE TOO AND AT MIDNIGHT YOU WILL SEE MY ENEMY THE YOUTH CLIMBED UP THE TREE AND PICKED SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN APPLES WHICH HE ATE FOR HIS SUPPER
ALAS HE'S NOT HERE HERE HERE BUT THE MOST WONDERFUL THING WAS THAT WHEN ONE HELD ONE'S FINGER IN THE STEAM OF THE POT THEN AT ONCE ONE COULD SMELL WHAT DINNER WAS READY IN ANY FIRE PLACE IN THE TOWN
THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
YES BUT HELP ME FIRST SAID BIG KLAUS OR ELSE YOU SHALL HAVE A BEATING AND SO HE CREPT INTO THE LARGE SACK WHICH WAS LYING ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE OXEN
DRAGGED A LOT OF PINE WOOD AND ROPES TO THE SPOT THEY FASTENED SOME OF THE BURNING PINE WOOD TO THE END OF THE ROPE AND LET IT SLOWLY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS AT FIRST IT WAS QUITE DARK
SHE SAID THE PORRIDGE IS SALT I GOT THE MILK BY WITCHCRAFT YESTERDAY OUT OF FOUR KINGDOMS
OF HAVING THEIR HORSES SHOD WITH SHARP NAILS NO ONE MANAGED TO GET MORE THAN HALF WAY UP AND THEN THEY ALL FELL BACK RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STEEP SLIPPERY HILL
THAT IF THEY HAD KNOWN ONLY HALF OF WHAT THEY DID KNOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ENOUGH THEY BOTH WANTED TO MARRY THE KING'S DAUGHTER FOR SHE HAD PROCLAIMED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE FOR HER HUSBAND THE MAN WHO KNEW BEST HOW TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS
MERELY BECAUSE THE ONE WAS IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ALL THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE STANDING ROUND THE KING'S THRONE AND WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN THICK MASSES ALMOST OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO SEE THE PRINCESS RECEIVE THE SUITORS
ONLY THE BIRDS WHO FLY A MAN NEVER IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER TROUBLE SAID THE HUNTER THAT ONE I CAN EASILY REMOVE FROM YOUR HEART SO HE WRAPPED HER ROUND IN HIS CLOAK AND WISHED THEMSELVES TO THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SALAD IS THEN THOUGHT THE HUNTER THE CABBAGE MUST HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK AND HE SAID I WILL GO TO THE KITCHEN AND FETCH IT MYSELF WHEN HE CAME THERE HE SAW THE TWO DONKEYS RUNNING ABOUT IN THE COURTYARD BUT THE SALAD WAS LYING ON THE GROUND
AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
SO HE TOOK LEAVE OF HIS PARENTS SLUNG HIS HUNTING KNAPSACK AND HIS GUN ROUND HIM AND JOURNEYED INTO THE WORLD IT HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY HE WENT THROUGH A THICK WOOD AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE END OF IT THERE LAY IN THE PLAIN BEFORE HIM A LARGE CASTLE
THEN SHE STOOD STILL AND WEPT THE SWINEHERD WAS SCOLDING AND THE RAIN WAS STREAMING DOWN ALAS WHAT AN UNHAPPY CREATURE I AM SOBBED THE PRINCESS IF ONLY I HAD TAKEN THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCE
BUT AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED IT THE OLD HAG GREW SO THIRSTY THAT SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND ASKED HER DAUGHTER TO GO OUT AND BRING HER SOME WATER FROM THE RIVER THAT RAN NEAR BY
THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
AND THEY POINTED TO AND DESCRIBED THE SPLENDID MATERIAL WHICH WAS NOT THERE STUPID I AM NOT THOUGHT THE MAN SO IT MUST BE MY GOOD OFFICE FOR WHICH I AM NOT FITTED IT IS STRANGE CERTAINLY BUT NO ONE MUST BE ALLOWED TO NOTICE IT
THE OLD MINISTER PAID GREAT ATTENTION SO THAT HE COULD TELL THE SAME TO THE EMPEROR WHEN HE CAME BACK TO HIM WHICH HE DID THE IMPOSTORS NOW WANTED MORE MONEY MORE SILK AND MORE GOLD TO USE IN THEIR WEAVING
SOON AFTER BIG KLAUS CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH AND TAKING UP THE SACK ON HIS SHOULDERS IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF IT HAD BECOME LIGHTER FOR THE OLD CATTLE DRIVER WAS NOT HALF AS HEAVY AS LITTLE KLAUS HOW EASY HE IS TO CARRY NOW
NOW WE MUST GO IN AT ONCE SAID SNATI
AND THE OLD KING FELL ON HER NECK AND KISSED HER BUT SHE WAS VERY MUCH TROUBLED AND SAID DEAR FATHER LISTEN TO WHAT HAS BEFALLEN ME I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME HOME AGAIN OUT OF THE GREAT WILD WOOD IF I HAD NOT COME TO AN IRON STOVE
JUST THINK HOW MANY THINGS I CAN GET FROM THIS WIZARD
POINTING AT THE SIGNATURES SAID I WILL TAKE YOU UNDERGROUND WITH ME YOU SHALL HAVE A MEAL THERE IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL GET FOR YOUR ROAST MEAT YOU SHALL BE FREE
THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
AND HIS HORSE HAD DIED OF EXHAUSTION WHILE HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM WANT AND MISERY BUT STILL HE HAD COME ON NO TRACE OF HER HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AT LAST ONE DAY HE CAME TO A HUT IN FRONT OF WHICH SAT A VERY OLD MAN
SHE WAS COMBING HER SILVER HAIR
BUT AT LAST HE FELT THAT THE BARREL WAS KNOCKING AGAINST ROCKS AT WHICH HE WAS A LITTLE CHEERED THINKING IT WAS PROBABLY LAND AND NOT MERELY A
WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
WHEN THE GIANT CAME ACROSS HIM HE STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCE FOR A LITTLE
UNTIL ALL THE HORSES BEGAN TO FOUNDER BENEATH THEM AT LAST THE PRINCE'S HORSE GAVE WAY TOO AND THEN THERE CAME OVER THEM A DARKNESS SO BLACK THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER SEE THE HIND
WHOSE BRANCHES ALMOST PUT THEIR EYES OUT BUT THE LITTLE SISTER TIED THE TWIGS TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF RIBBON AND THEY GOT PAST SAFELY AND AFTER RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD CAME OUT ON TO THE OPEN FIELDS
YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
AND SO EVERY MORNING THERE LIES A GOLD PIECE UNDER HIS PILLOW SHE TOLD HER HOW THEY COULD GET HOLD OF IT AND HOW SHE WAS TO COAX IT FROM HIM AND AT LAST THREATENED HER ANGRILY SAYING
WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
HE WANDERED ABOUT ALL DAY FULL OF DESPAIR AND MISERY AND WHEN HE LAY DOWN AT NIGHT HE COULD GET NO REST BUT LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT SUNK IN SORROWFUL THOUGHTS ONE MORNING
AND THE BROTHERS TURNED ROUND TO SEE WHAT IN THE WORLD HE COULD HAVE FOUND BLOCKHEAD SAID THEY THAT IS AN OLD WOODEN SHOE WITHOUT THE TOP ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THAT TOO TO THE PRINCESS OF COURSE I SHALL RETURNED BLOCKHEAD HANS
HE SAYS
THEN SHE ATE AND AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE SHE AT ONCE LOST HER HUMAN FORM AND RAN AS A DONKEY INTO THE YARD WHEN THE HUNTER HAD WASHED HIS FACE SO THAT THE CHANGED ONES MIGHT KNOW HIM HE WENT INTO THE YARD SAYING
DIE THEN SAID THE SON
ONE DAY THE CRAB SAID TO THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE GO TO THE KING AND TELL HIM I WISH TO MARRY HIS YOUNGER DAUGHTER THE OLD WOMAN WENT ACCORDINGLY AND LAID THE MATTER BEFORE THE KING WHO LAUGHED A LITTLE AT THE NOTION OF HIS DAUGHTER MARRYING A CRAB
NOW WE ARE COMING TO A KING'S SEAT AND YOU MUST ASK THE KING TO KEEP US ALL WINTER AND TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
WHY THAT IS WHAT I PLAY SHE SAID HE MUST BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED SWINEHERD LISTEN GO DOWN AND ASK HIM WHAT THE INSTRUMENT COSTS AND ONE OF THE LADIES IN WAITING HAD TO GO DOWN BUT SHE PUT ON WOODEN CLOGS
ALAS MY LOVE SHE REPLIED OVER THERE LIES THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE COSTLY PRECIOUS STONES GROW I HAVE A GREAT LONGING TO GO THERE SO THAT WHEN I THINK OF IT I AM VERY SAD FOR WHO CAN FETCH THEM
I'LL SEE TO YOUR HORSES SAID BIG KLAUS
BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I MUST GO ON WITH THE PROCESSION NOW
AND THE HEAD SANK BACK INTO THE WATER WITHOUT HAVING SAID A WORD THE POND LAY STILL AND MOTIONLESS GLITTERING IN THE MOONSHINE AND THE HUNTER'S WIFE WAS NOT A BIT BETTER OFF THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE
OH DEAR OH DEAR GROANED LITTLE KLAUS IN THE SACK TWISTING AND TURNING HIMSELF BUT HE COULD NOT UNDO THE STRING THERE CAME BY AN OLD OLD SHEPHERD WITH SNOW WHITE HAIR AND A LONG STAFF IN HIS HAND
BUT SHE KNEW THAT THE PRINCE WHOM SHE HAD FREED FROM THE IRON STOVE IN THE GREAT WOOD WAS IN THE CASTLE SO SHE WAS TAKEN ON AS A KITCHEN MAID FOR VERY SMALL WAGES NOW THE PRINCE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY ANOTHER PRINCESS FOR HE THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD LONG AGO
ANSWER HIM THUS YOUR MASTER THE KING HAS SENT ME HITHER TO TELL YOU TO SEND HIM HIS GOLDEN ARMOUR AND HIS STEED AND THE SILVER APPLE AND BRING THEM TO ME
EVIL WILL COME OF IT PLACE YOURSELF AT THE WINDOW WITH YOUR SISTERS I WILL RIDE BY AND THROW YOU THE SILVER APPLE TAKE IT IN YOUR HAND BUT IF THEY ASK YOU WHO I AM SAY THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW SO SAYING HE KISSED HER REPEATED HIS WARNING ONCE MORE AND WENT AWAY
HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
BEING SOMETHING OF A SWIMMER HE AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO KICK THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE BARREL
A LARGE PORRIDGE POT WAS HANGING NOW YOU MUST EMPTY ALL THE SALT INTO THE PORRIDGE POT SAID SNATI RING DID SO AND SOON THE TROLLS WAKENED UP
HE HAD TO GO A LONG WAY BEFORE HE CAME TO THE RIVER AND LITTLE KLAUS WAS NOT VERY LIGHT THE ROAD PASSED BY THE CHURCH THE ORGAN WAS SOUNDING AND THE PEOPLE WERE SINGING MOST BEAUTIFULLY BIG KLAUS PUT DOWN THE SACK WITH LITTLE KLAUS IN IT
ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
LEFT THE GRANITE AND STONES AND WISHED HERSELF HOME AGAIN BUT WHEN THE HUNTER HAD FINISHED HIS SLEEP AND AWOKE HE FOUND THAT HIS LOVE HAD BETRAYED HIM AND LEFT HIM ALONE ON THE WILD MOUNTAIN OH SAID HE
THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED THAN THE PRINCESS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE COULD FIND THE WAY TO THAT PALACE YES HE ANSWERED CERTAINLY AND NOW SHE DESIRED HIM TO GUIDE HER THITHER AT ONCE THE OLD MAN DID SO AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE PALACE HE HID HER BEHIND THE GREAT PICTURE
HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
THEN A RUSHING SOUND WAS HEARD AND A WAVE SWEPT THE FLUTE OFF THE BANK AND SOON THE HEAD OF THE HUNTER APPEARED AND ROSE UP HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE WAS HALF OUT OF THE WATER
THEN HE DRANK A SECOND AND THE SWORD BEGAN TO MOVE BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD DRUNK A THIRD DROP WAS HE ABLE TO SWING THE SWORD OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE HID HIMSELF IN THE CASTLE
WHEN THE BRIDE SAW IT SHE WANTED TO HAVE IT BUT THE MAID WOULD ONLY GIVE IT HER ON CONDITION THAT SHE SHOULD SLEEP FOR THE THIRD TIME BY THE PRINCE'S DOOR BUT THE PRINCE TOOK CARE NOT TO DRINK THE SLEEPING DRAUGHT WHEN SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO SAY
JUST LISTEN TO THE INNOCENT CHILD SAID THE FATHER AND EACH ONE WHISPERED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR WHAT THE CHILD HAD SAID BUT HE HAS NOTHING ON
MUST THROW THE COMB BEHIND THEM AND RUN FOR THEIR LIVES FOR WHERE THE COMB FELL A DENSE FOREST WOULD START UP WHICH WOULD DELAY THE WITCH SO LONG
IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR MY GRANDMOTHER THAT SHE WAS DEAD ALREADY
THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
BUT AS SOON AS MORE PEOPLE PASSED BY AND NODDED HIM GOOD MORNING
KNOCKED ALL HIS FOUR HORSES ON THE HEAD SKINNED THEM
AND SHE COULD HAVE IT TO HELP HER IN THE HOUSE THE OLD WOMAN WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND BEGAN TO FONDLE THE PRINCE WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT HE STAYED THERE WITH THEM AND WAS VERY WILLING AND OBEDIENT TO THEM IN EVERYTHING
NO I DO NOT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN
OTHERWISE HE WOULD GET INTO GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE PRINCE ASSENTED TO THIS AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY AFTER HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE KING AND WAS SETTING OUT ON THE SEARCH
THAT MUST BE BECAUSE I HEARD PART OF THE SERVICE
AND HERDED THEM AS BEFORE THE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS BECAME GREAT FRIENDS BUT THEY DID NOT RECOGNISE EACH OTHER IN THE LEAST BUT ONE EVENING WHEN THE MOON WAS FULL THEY SAT TOGETHER WATCHING THEIR FLOCKS
THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
AND WORKED AT THE EMPTY LOOMS TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO KNOW HOW FAR THEY HAVE GOT ON WITH THE CLOTH THOUGHT THE EMPEROR BUT HE REMEMBERED WHEN HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WHOEVER WAS STUPID OR NOT FIT FOR HIS OFFICE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
HE PUT ON THE CLOAK AND WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE IT SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE COULD SEE TO GO WITH IT ON REACHING THE RIVER HE WENT TO TAKE A DRINK LIKE HIS SISTER BUT AT THAT MOMENT RING AND SNATI
THEN SHE GOT DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WENT TOWARDS THE LIGHT SHE CAME TO A LITTLE OLD HOUSE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF GRASS GROWING ROUND AND STOOD IN FRONT OF A LITTLE HEAP OF WOOD SHE THOUGHT ALAS WHAT AM I COMING TO
YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF THE CATTLE WON'T YOU ASKED THE OLD MAN
HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
GO AND COLLECT ALL THE DEW THAT LIES ON THE LEAVES AND LET US SWIM IN IT THEN LAY US IN THE SUN
INDEED INTERRUPTED THE COBBLER ANGRILY DID HE TELL YOU THIS WAIT A MINUTE YOU RASCAL WHY I TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT IT MYSELF ONLY AN HOUR AGO
BUT OUT OF ONE THEY SHALL MAKE A BED FOR ME AND OUT OF THE OTHER ONE FOR YOU AND WITH THIS THE EMPRESS WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
AND SHE TOOK IT OUT AND KEPT IT IN HER BOSOM WHICH WAS THE WARMEST PLACE SHE COULD THINK OF A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE OLD WOMAN HAD PAID HER VISIT THE KING CAME HOME HAVING CONQUERED HIS ENEMIES AT THIS PROOF THAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SPOKEN TRUTH
AND HASTILY ASSEMBLING WHATEVER SOLDIERS HAPPENED TO BE AT HAND
BY THIS TIME THE OGRESS HAD SLAIN ALL HER DAUGHTERS BUT ONE WHO AWOKE SUDDENLY AND SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED MOTHER WHAT ARE YOU DOING CRIED SHE DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE KILLED MY SISTERS
AND ONE DAY AS HE WAS PLAYING IN THE STREET WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN THE OGRESS CAME BY GO TO YOUR FATHER SHE SAID AND REPEAT THIS SPEECH TO HIM I WANT MY FORFEIT WHEN AM I TO HAVE IT ALL RIGHT REPLIED THE CHILD
SAID SHE FOR YOU MUST HAVE SOME SUPPER I CANNOT LET YOU GO HUNGRY TO BED THEN BENDING OVER THE BASKET SHE WHISPERED SOME MAGIC WORDS AND INSTANTLY A TABLE COVERED WITH FRUITS AND CAKES STOOD ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM
IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FIND YOURSELF IN ANY DIFFICULTY AND CANNOT TELL WHAT TO DO
THE POOR LITTLE BABIES HAD FOUND NO REST EVEN IN THEIR GRAVES IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THERE SPRANG UP TWO BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ASPENS AND THE STEPMOTHER WHO HATED THE SIGHT OF THE TREES WHICH REMINDED HER OF HER CRIME
BROUGHT OUT A TINY BASKET MADE OF BIRCH BARK SHE HELD IT OUT TO THE QUEEN SAYING IN THE BASKET YOU WILL FIND A BIRD'S EGG THIS YOU MUST BE CAREFUL TO KEEP IN A WARM PLACE FOR THREE MONTHS WHEN IT WILL TURN INTO A DOLL
EARLY ONE MORNING THE EMPEROR'S FISHERMEN WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER TO GET SOME FISH FOR THEIR MASTER'S BREAKFAST AND CAST THEIR NETS INTO THE STREAM
WE SHALL BE THERE BEFORE DARK WHO KNOWS REPLIED HANS MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO DELAY OUR JOURNEY AND I NEED NOT REMIND YOU OF OUR CONTRACT THAT THE MOMENT THE SUN SETS I CEASE TO BE YOUR SERVANT
BUT IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR WHEN AT LAST HE STOOD UPON THE GROUND HE PROVED TO BE ABOUT THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS VIRGILIUS HIMSELF AND COAL BLACK BESIDES WHY
THE POOR LITTLE DWARF ROAMED ABOUT ALL THE REST OF THE DAY WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
AND A GOOD LOOKING BOY TOO AND PLEASANT SO THAT CUSTOMERS WERE TAKEN BY HIM WELL WELL SO GOES THE WORLD BUT WHERE IS YOUR SON ASKED JEM WITH A TREMBLING VOICE HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS REPLIED THE MAN
AND TOLD HIS WIFE ALL HE HAD SEEN AND THE MESSAGE SENT BY MOHAMMED
AND HE REMINDED HER OF THE DAY WHEN HE WENT AWAY WITH THE OLD WOMAN AND OF MANY THINGS IN HIS CHILDHOOD AND TOLD HER HOW THE FAIRY HAD BEWITCHED HIM AND HE HAD SERVED HER SEVEN YEARS HANNAH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
THEN THE BOY TURNED TO HIS FATHER AND SAID GO IN PEACE DEAR FATHER AND GIVE MY MOTHER GREETING AND TELL HER NOT TO BE ANXIOUS ANY MORE FOR SHE CAN KEEP ALL HER CHILDREN AND HALFMAN MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE HOME
DEAR FATHER SAID HALFMAN ARE YOU NOT GLAD TO SEE ME YOU WEEP FOR MY BROTHER BUT I AM YOUR SON TOO AND HE STOLE MY BRIDE FROM ME AND TRIED TO DROWN ME IN THE BROOK IF HE IS DEAD I AT LEAST AM ALIVE
WHEN ONE DAY DURING THE KING'S ABSENCE THE STEPMOTHER FOUND DOTTERINE SITTING UNDER A LIME TREE SHE FELL AS USUAL INTO A PASSION AND BEAT THE CHILD SO BADLY THAT DOTTERINE WENT STAGGERING TO HER OWN ROOM HER NURSE WAS NOT THERE
WHEN MARK SAW VASSILI HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WITH HIS WIFE HOW DARED YOU MARRY MY DAUGHTER WITHOUT MY CONSENT HE ASKED I ONLY CARRIED OUT YOUR ORDERS SAID SHE HERE IS YOUR LETTER MARK READ IT
HE IS TWIN BROTHER TO MY OWN HORSE AND CAN FLY AS HIGH AS THE CLOUDS THEMSELVES BUT NO ONE CAN EVER GET THIS HORSE WITHOUT FIRST SERVING THE OLD WOMAN FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS AND BESIDES THE HORSES SHE HAS A FOAL AND ITS MOTHER
AND EVERYTHING PASSED AS BEFORE AND SO IT HAPPENED FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AT LENGTH THE OTHER BROTHERS GREW ANGRY AT SEEING THAT HE NEVER CAME BACK WITHOUT BRINGING TWO GOLDEN APPLES WITH HIM AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT AN OLD WITCH WHO PROMISED TO SPY AFTER HIM
LAY THE DOLL IN A BASKET LINED WITH SOFT WOOL AND LEAVE IT ALONE FOR IT WILL NOT NEED ANY FOOD AND BY AND BY YOU WILL FIND IT HAS GROWN TO BE THE SIZE OF A BABY THEN YOU WILL HAVE A BABY OF YOUR OWN
BUT THE MOMENT THAT THEY LIFTED THEIR CAPS AND SHOWED THEIR GOLDEN HAIR AND THE GOLDEN STARS THE EYES OF THE EMPEROR AND OF ALL HIS GUESTS WERE BENT ON THEM AND THEY COULD HARDLY BEAR THE POWER OF SO MANY GLANCES
WITH A TINY GLIMMER OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END OF IT THEN HIS HEART FELT GLAD AND HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND DUG AND DUG TILL THE LITTLE HOLE BECAME A BIG ONE AND HE COULD WRIGGLE HIMSELF THROUGH AND WHEN HE HAD GOT OUTSIDE
AS LONG AS YOU DELIVER ME FROM MY BROTHER AND GET ME MY WIFE MOUNT ON MY BACK THEN AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE SHALL BE THERE THE OGRESS WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD AND IN A FEW MINUTES THEY ARRIVED AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN WHERE HALFMAN AND HIS BROTHERS LIVED
AND CARRIED HER OVER THE AIRY BRIDGE BACK TO ROME NOW VIRGILIUS DID NOT THINK THAT EITHER HIS PALACE OR EVEN ROME ITSELF WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO CONTAIN SUCH A PEARL AS THE PRINCESS SO HE BUILT HER A CITY
AND THE SENATORS CAME HURRYING TO SEE WHO WAS REBELLING AGAINST THE MAJESTY OF THE EMPIRE THEN THEY MADE READY THEIR ARMIES AND MARCHED AGAINST THE FOE
HER FACE COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR A VEIL COVERED HER HEAD BUT AS SHE CAME UP TO THE PLACE WHERE THE QUEEN WAS STANDING WITH THE BABIES SHE DREW THE VEIL ASIDE AND EVERYONE WAS DAZZLED WITH HER BEAUTY
I AM THE KING OF THE SNAKES WAS THE REPLY AND THIS IS MY PALACE
SHE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE FELT AS IF THE WALLS WOULD STIFLE HER SO SHE WANDERED OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND THREW HERSELF DOWN ON A GRASSY BANK UNDER THE SHADE OF A LIME TREE
FETCH ME SOME WATER I AM DYING OF THIRST THE PRINCE WHO WAS VERY TENDER HEARTED BROUGHT SOME WATER AT ONCE AND PUSHED IT THROUGH A HOLE IN THE BARREL AND AS HE DID SO ONE OF THE IRON HOOPS BURST
WHEN THE DAYS ARE SHORT THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE LONGER TO GET SOMETHING FINISHED NOT AT ALL ANSWERED HANS
WHOM HE HAD TWICE TRIED TO KILL HE SAID TO THE ABBOT
WHICH HAS BEEN HIDDEN THERE IN TIME OF WAR BESIDES CHURCH PLATE YOU WILL FIND BAGS OF MONEY WHICH HAVE BEEN LYING IN THIS PLACE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND NO ONE KNOWS TO WHOM IT ALL BELONGS A THIRD OF THIS MONEY YOU MUST GIVE TO THE POOR
AND WHATSOEVER HE WAS TAUGHT HE DID NOT LEARN IT HIS MOTHER NEVER WISHED HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE SO SHE SAID WELL STAY AT HOME MY SON AND HE STAYED AT HOME EATING AND SLEEPING
THAT HE KEPT KNOCKING HIS NOSE AGAINST THE WALL OR CUPBOARDS THE SQUIRRELS AND GUINEA PIGS RAN WHIMPERING AFTER HIM AS THOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO TOO AND HE BEGGED THEM TO COME WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR
OH BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE TELL ME IF YOU CAN WHERE THE DRAGON EMPEROR LIVES THE MAN TOLD HIM WHERE HE WOULD FIND THE PALACE AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO GET THERE AND THE PRINCE THANKED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTIONS
BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE AND WAITED ABOUT MIDNIGHT SHE SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM HALFMAN WHY DID YOU COME HERE SAID SHE I HAVE A QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU WELL ASK IT
THE BOYS WITH THE GOLDEN STARS ONCE UPON A TIME WHAT HAPPENED DID HAPPEN AND IF IT HAD NOT HAPPENED YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD THIS STORY WELL ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AN EMPEROR WHO HAD HALF A WORLD ALL TO HIMSELF TO RULE OVER
BUT WHO ARE YOU ASKED VIRGILIUS WHO NEVER DID ANYTHING IN A HURRY
WITHOUT WETTING THE SOLES OF HIS FEET THE PRINCESS SPENT SOME DAYS IN THE PALACE OF VIRGILIUS LOOKING AT WONDERS OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED THOUGH SHE DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE PRESENTS
YOU CAN HAVE WHICH YOU LIKE GIVE ME INSTEAD THAT HALF STARVED CREATURE IN THE CORNER ASKED THE PRINCE I PREFER HIM TO ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS YOU CAN'T REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY REPLIED THE WOMAN YES I DO SAID THE PRINCE
TWO BOYS TWINS EACH WITH A GOLDEN STAR ON HIS FOREHEAD AS BRIGHT AS THOSE IN THE SKY AND THOUGH THEY SPOKE LOW THE YOUNG MEN HEARD AND TURNED THEIR HORSES HEADS
I TURN ROUND BECAUSE I HAVE NO EYES IN THE BACK OF MY NECK SAID HANS CEASE TALKING NONSENSE REPLIED THE MINISTER AND GIVE ALL YOUR MIND TO GETTING US TO THE TOWN BEFORE NIGHTFALL HANS DID NOT ANSWER BUT RODE ON STEADILY
HE WILL IN THE END GET THE CHOICE OF ANY HORSE AS A PRESENT FROM THE OLD WOMAN BUT IF HE FAILS TO KEEP THE FOAL AND ITS MOTHER SAFE ON ANY ONE OF THE THREE NIGHTS HIS HEAD WILL PAY THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE WATCHED TILL THE DRAGON LEFT THE HOUSE
HE THOUGHT THE OLD WOMAN TOOK OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES AND WRAPPED HIM UP IN A SQUIRREL SKIN AND THAT HE WENT ABOUT WITH THE OTHER SQUIRRELS AND GUINEA PIGS WHO WERE ALL VERY PLEASANT AND WELL MANNERED AND WAITED ON THE OLD WOMAN
AND THEY BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB SAYING THIS IS HALFMAN'S WORK WHY DID WE LISTEN TO HIM BUT HALFMAN WAS FAR AWAY WHEN HE ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE HE RAN ON STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM FOR SOME TIME
LAST NIGHT WE DREAMED THAT BENEATH THE FOOT OF A HILL THERE LIES BURIED A POT OF GOLD HAVE WE YOUR LEAVE TO DIG FOR IT AND LEAVE HAVING BEEN GIVEN THE MESSENGERS TOOK WORKMEN
AND THE COLT RAN BEHIND HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS SEAT FOR A LONG TIME IN SPITE OF ALL HER EFFORTS TO THROW HIM BUT AT LENGTH HE GREW SO WEARY THAT HE FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN HE WOKE HE FOUND HIMSELF SITTING ON A LOG
THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED FROM THE TOWN HANS SAID HE WHAT A FOOL YOU WERE NOT TO COME WITH ME YESTERDAY I WAS WELL FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED
I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD AND MINE SHALL YOU BE MOST LOVELY OF EMPRESSES CRIED THE EMPEROR AND SWUNG LAPTITZA AND HER STRAWBERRIES ON THE HORSE BEFORE HIM AND I WILL HAVE YOU AND I YOU EXCLAIMED TWO OF HIS FRIENDS
THIS MADE JEM VERY ANGRY YOU ARE A VERY RUDE OLD WOMAN HE CRIED OUT FIRST YOU MESS ALL OUR NICE HERBS ABOUT WITH YOUR HORRID BROWN FINGERS AND SNIFF AT THEM WITH YOUR LONG NOSE TILL NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE TO BUY THEM
AT THE END OF THREE DAYS SHE COULD DO EVERYTHING AS WELL AS IF SHE HAD CLEANED POTS AND SWEPT ROOMS ALL HER LIFE ONE MORNING DOTTERINE WAS BUSY SCOURING A WOODEN TUB WHEN A NOBLE LADY HAPPENED TO PASS THROUGH THE VILLAGE
FAIRIES AND THEIR LIKE BELONG TO EVERY COUNTRY AND EVERY AGE AND NO DOUBT WE SHOULD SEE PLENTY OF THEM NOW IF WE ONLY KNEW HOW
SO THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME TO LAY THE EGG IN IT IT MIGHT NOT RISK ANY HARM THREE MONTHS PASSED AND AS THE OLD WOMAN HAD BIDDEN HER THE QUEEN TOOK THE EGG FROM HER BOSOM AND LAID IT SNUGLY AMIDST THE WARM WOOLLEN FOLDS
THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO LOOK AT IT AND THE FIRST THING SHE SAW WAS THE BROKEN EGGSHELL AND A LITTLE DOLL LYING AMONG THE PIECES THEN SHE FELT HAPPY AT LAST AND LEAVING THE DOLL IN PEACE TO GROW WAITED AS SHE HAD BEEN TOLD
AND HANS WAS LEFT ALONE HE GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME TILL HE FOUND THE STAIRCASE IN THE TOWER AND THEN BEGAN TO FEEL HIS WAY UP THE STEPS ON THE FIRST LANDING
OR ENTER THE PALACE AND TRUST TO CHANCE THAT NOTHING EVIL WOULD HAPPEN BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DECIDE A LITTLE SWALLOW FLEW UP WITH THE BASKET IN ITS BEAK AND THE GIRL WAS HAPPY AGAIN THE FEAST WAS ALREADY AT ITS HEIGHT
AND SAYING THE CHILD HAD NOT COME BACK ALL DAY I ALWAYS THOUGHT AND SAID THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND WOULD HAPPEN JEM WAS A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND EVERYONE MADE MUCH OF HIM AND MY WIFE WAS SO PROUD OF HIM
BUT I THINK I SHALL GET THE BETTER OF YOU NOW AND HE WAITED A MONTH AND WAS VERY KIND AND PLEASANT TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE SAID TO VASSILI ONE DAY
THE EMPEROR DID AS VIRGILIUS ADVISED BUT THIEVES AND MURDERERS LAUGHED AT THE HORSE AND WENT ABOUT THEIR MISDEEDS AS USUAL BUT AT THE LAST STROKE OF THE BELL
WHERE THE OLD MAN ASKED DID YOU THINK OF ME
SUPPORTED BY TWELVE CUSHIONS WHEN THE PRINCES ENTERED ONE OF THE CUSHIONS FELL DOWN AND THERE REMAINED ONLY ELEVEN TAKE OFF YOUR CAPS SAID ONE OF THE COURTIERS A COVERED HEAD IS AMONG MEN A SIGN OF HONOUR WE WISH TO SEEM WHAT WE ARE
ANSWERED THE VOICE DO YOU MARK UPON THE GROUND WHERE YOU ARE STANDING A SLIDE OR BOLT I DO REPLIED VIRGILIUS THEN SAID THE VOICE
SHE TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER ARMS AND HOLDING IT UP BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT HENCEFORWARD IT WOULD BE KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DOTTERINE A NAME WHICH NO ONE UNDERSTOOD BUT THE QUEEN
WHICH THEY CARRIED TO THE STOVE HERE THE OLD WOMAN WAS BUSTLING ABOUT AND JEM COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS COOKING SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL FOR HIM AT LAST THE BROTH BEGAN TO BUBBLE AND BOIL AND SHE DREW OFF THE SAUCEPAN
THEN HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SAID IT IS ALL READY LET US PUT HIM ON WHAT IS THE HURRY MY GOOD OGRE ASKED HALFMAN YOU HAVE ME IN YOUR POWER AND I CANNOT ESCAPE I AM SO THIN NOW
THEY ALL GREW INTO MEN AND ONE DAY THEY TOLD THEIR FATHER IT WAS HIGH TIME HE FOUND WIVES FOR THEM I HAVE A BROTHER HE ANSWERED WHO LIVES AWAY IN THE EAST AND HE HAS TWELVE DAUGHTERS GO AND MARRY THEM
AND WILL PRESENT YOUR MONASTERY WITH TWENTY THOUSAND CROWNS THE ABBOT HESITATED A GOOD DEAL BUT HE CONSULTED ALL THE OTHER MONKS AND AT LAST THEY DECIDED THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF VASSILI'S GOOD FORTUNE
AT LAST HE REACHED THE TOP AND AS HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO LOOK ROUND HIM HE SAW ANOTHER HEADLESS MAN COWERING IN THE VERY BELL ITSELF WAITING TILL HANS SHOULD SEIZE THE BELL PULL
VASSILI WALKED IN AND WENT FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER ASTONISHED AT ALL THE SPLENDOUR HE SAW WHEN HE REACHED THE LAST ROOM OF ALL HE FOUND A BEAUTIFUL GIRL SITTING ON A BED AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM SHE SAID
WHOM HE HAD KNOWN IN OLD DAYS GOOD MORNING URBAN SAID HE MAY I LOOK AT MYSELF IN YOUR GLASS FOR A MOMENT WITH PLEASURE SAID THE BARBER LAUGHING AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN HIS SHOP FELL TO LAUGHING ALSO
JUST SEE THAT FRIGHTFUL DWARF WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT HE WANTS ME TO THINK HE IS MY SON JEM
WHO WAS KING OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY DECLARE WAR AGAINST THE EMPEROR AND BESIEGE SOME OF THE FRONTIER TOWNS WITH A LARGE ARMY THIS TIME HER SCHEME WAS SUCCESSFUL THE YOUNG EMPEROR SPRANG UP IN WRATH THE MOMENT HE HEARD THE NEWS AND VOWED THAT NOTHING
THE JUDGE THANKED HIM JOYFULLY AS HE TOOK THE APPLES AND WENT TO SEEK HIS WIFE EAT THESE APPLES AT ONCE HE CRIED AND YOU WILL HAVE TWELVE SONS SO SHE SAT DOWN AND ATE ELEVEN OF THEM BUT JUST AS SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWELFTH
I HAVE SAID ALREADY GET AWAY REPLIED HANNAH QUITE ANGRILY YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF ME BY YOUR GAMES YOU MONSTROSITY OH DEAR OH DEAR SHE MUST BE WANDERING IN HER MIND MURMURED THE LAD TO HIMSELF
FROM WHAT HE HEARD HE FANCIED THEY WERE GOING TO SEE A DWARF FOR HE HEARD THEM CALL OUT JUST LOOK AT THE UGLY DWARF WHAT A LONG NOSE HE HAS AND SEE HOW HIS HEAD IS STUCK IN BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS
WEEPING SILENTLY AT THE HARSH WORDS THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE GATES WHEN A SERVANT RAN UP TO THEM THE EMPEROR COMMANDS YOU TO RETURN PANTED HE THE EMPRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU THE PRINCES THOUGHT A MOMENT
THIS SHE SAID TURNING TO THE KING IS THE GIRL WHOM YOU HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED TO BE YOUR SISTER AND WHO VANISHED DURING THE SIEGE SHE IS NOT YOUR SISTER AT ALL BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY
EXACTLY IN THE PLACE DESCRIBED BY THE DWARF THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS WORK THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON WHEN THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ASLEEP HE STOLE OUT ARMED WITH A PICKAXE AND WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY
BUT AT LAST SHE STOPPED IN FRONT OF A SMALL TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE SHE DREW A RUSTY OLD HOOK FROM HER POCKET AND STUCK IT INTO A LITTLE HOLE IN THE DOOR WHICH SUDDENLY FLEW OPEN HOW SURPRISED JEM WAS WHEN THEY WENT IN
AND THERE YOU WILL FIND A LARGE STONE BUILT INTO THE WALL BUT NOT CEMENTED LIKE THE REST THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE MOON IS FULL AND AT MIDNIGHT YOU MUST GO TO THE SPOT AND GET THE STONE OUT OF THE WALL WITH A PICKAXE UNDER THE STONE LIES A GREAT TREASURE
THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID KIT
NO INDEED SIR REPLIED KIT TAKING COURAGE TO LOOK UP I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING FATHER ALIVE SAID THE NOTARY DEAD SIR MOTHER YES SIR MARRIED AGAIN EH
I GOT IN BEHIND REPLIED THE MARCHIONESS OH PLEASE DRIVE ON SIR DON'T STOP AND GO TOWARDS THE CITY WILL YOU AND OH DO PLEASE MAKE HASTE BECAUSE IT'S OF CONSEQUENCE THERE'S SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU THERE
SO DID THE MARCHIONESS FLUTTER ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL SHE BELIEVED HERSELF IN SAFETY AND THEN BEAR SWIFTLY DOWN UPON THE PORT FOR WHICH SHE WAS BOUND SHE HAD NO BONNET NOTHING ON HER HEAD BUT A GREAT CAP
WOKE THE BABY WHO FINDING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY JOVIAL AND AGREEABLE IN PROGRESS WAS NO SOONER IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS THAN IT BEGAN TO KICK AND LAUGH MOST VIGOROUSLY THIS NEW ILLUSTRATION OF HIS ARGUMENT SO TICKLED KIT
IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN
REJOINED THE OLD LADY A VERY GOOD LAD AND I AM SURE HE IS A GOOD SON KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH
AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH
IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING
OVERCAME EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION SO ENTRUSTING WHISKER TO THE CHARGE OF A MAN WHO WAS LINGERING HARD BY IN EXPECTATION OF THE JOB HE SUFFERED HIS COMPANION TO TAKE HIS HAND AND TO LEAD HIM UP THE DARK AND NARROW STAIRS
AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM
OH KIT DON'T TALK LIKE THAT I WOULD INDEED MOTHER AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE ME FEEL VERY WRETCHED AND UNCOMFORTABLE YOU'LL KEEP THAT BOW ON YOUR BONNET WHICH YOU'D MORE THAN HALF A MIND TO PULL OFF LAST WEEK
IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE WHY BLESS ME CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE LAD IS HERE MY DEAR DO YOU SEE
THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT AND PICKING HIS STEPS AS IF HE WERE SPYING ABOUT FOR THE CLEANEST PLACES AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY
HE FOUND THE BOX IN SAFETY RECEIVING FROM THE WIFE OF THIS IMMACULATE MAN A DIRECTION TO MISTER GARLAND'S HE TOOK THE BOX UPON HIS SHOULDER AND REPAIRED THITHER DIRECTLY TO BE SURE
NOW SIR WILL YOU HA THE GOODNESS TO GO ON THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND APPEARED TO BE QUITE ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING IT
FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER
CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
SAID THE SERVANT GIRL KIT GOT OFF THE BOX AND SAID YES HE WAS I'M AFRAID YOU'VE RUNG A GOOD MANY TIMES PERHAPS SHE REJOINED BUT WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN CATCHING THE PONY
AND HEARTY OF HIM AND I HONOUR HIM FROM THIS TIME BUT GET SOME SUPPER AND A MUG OF BEER FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST BE TIRED DO HAVE A MUG OF BEER IT WILL DO ME AS MUCH GOOD TO SEE YOU TAKE IT AS IF I MIGHT DRINK IT MYSELF
TO EAT COLD MEAT AND DRINK SMALL ALE AND USE HIS KNIFE AND FORK THE MORE AWKWARDLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN UNKNOWN BARBARA LOOKING ON AND OBSERVING HIM IT DID NOT APPEAR HOWEVER
THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
NOR INDULGED IN ANY ECCENTRIC PERFORMANCES UNTIL THEY ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF MISTER SWIVELLER'S LODGING WHERE MARVELLOUS TO RELATE HE CONSENTED TO STOP WHEN MISTER ABEL CHECKED HIM
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES AND AS THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM TICKLING HIS EAR AT THAT MOMENT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL
MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND LADY CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN
UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED IT SEEMED THAT MISTER CHUCKSTER HAD BEEN STANDING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING CARELESSLY AT THE PONY AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS
AND THEREFORE SOME HOPE THAT SHE WAS NOT TOO LATE SO THE MARCHIONESS DRIED HER EYES WITH THE BACKS OF HER HANDS AND STEALING SOFTLY UP THE STEPS PEEPED IN THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS STANDING BEHIND THE LID OF HIS DESK
WHAT'S HIS NAME QUILP AND THAT HE AND MISS NELL HAVE GONE TO LIVE ABROAD WHERE IT CAN'T BE TAKEN FROM THEM AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY
SAID HIS GUIDE IN AN EARNEST WHISPER OH YOU'D SAY IT WAS IF YOU HAD ONLY SEEN HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO MISTER ABEL MADE NO ANSWER AND TO SAY THE TRUTH KEPT A LONG WAY FROM THE BED AND VERY NEAR THE DOOR
JUST THE SIZE FOR THE PONY WITH A LITTLE ROOM OVER IT JUST THE SIZE FOR KIT WHITE CURTAINS WERE FLUTTERING AND BIRDS IN CAGES THAT LOOKED AS BRIGHT AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF GOLD WERE SINGING AT THE WINDOWS PLANTS WERE ARRANGED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PATH
PRAY DON'T TAKE TO GOING THERE REGULARLY FOR IF I WAS TO SEE YOUR GOOD HUMOURED FACE THAT HAS ALWAYS MADE HOME CHEERFUL TURNED INTO A GRIEVOUS ONE AND THE BABY TRAINED TO LOOK GRIEVOUS TOO AND TO CALL ITSELF A YOUNG SINNER BLESS ITS HEART AND A CHILD OF THE DEVIL
AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR
AND NETHER GARMENTS OF IRON GREY BESIDES THESE GLORIES HE SHONE IN THE LUSTRE OF A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS AND AN EXTREMELY STIFF AND SHINY HAT WHICH ON BEING STRUCK ANYWHERE WITH THE KNUCKLES SOUNDED LIKE A DRUM AND IN THIS ATTIRE
AT LAST IT WAS CONVEYED TO THE CARRIER'S AT WHOSE HOUSE AT FINCHLEY KIT WAS TO FIND IT NEXT DAY AND THE BOX BEING GONE THERE REMAINED BUT TWO QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION FIRSTLY WHETHER THE CARRIER WOULD LOSE
AND TELLING HIM HE WAS WANTED INSIDE BADE HIM GO IN AND HE WOULD MIND THE CHAISE THE WHILE IN GIVING HIM THIS DIRECTION MISTER CHUCKSTER REMARKED THAT HE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT BE BLESSED IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHETHER HE KIT
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE COTTAGE WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LITTLE SPIRES AT THE GABLE ENDS AND PIECES OF STAINED GLASS IN SOME OF THE WINDOWS ALMOST AS LARGE AS POCKET BOOKS ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS A LITTLE STABLE
KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT
EVEN IN RUNNING AWAY HOWEVER WHISKER WAS PERVERSE
AFTER THAT SELF WILLED PONY HAD AS HE AFTERWARDS LEARNED DODGED THE FAMILY ROUND A SMALL PADDOCK IN THE REAR FOR ONE HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE OLD GENTLEMAN RECEIVED HIM VERY KINDLY AND SO DID THE OLD LADY
SAID THE MARCHIONESS POINTING TO ONE WHERE THERE WAS A FAINT LIGHT COME MISTER ABEL WHO WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST RETIRING CREATURES IN EXISTENCE AND NATURALLY TIMID WITHAL HESITATED
AND A VERY CHEERFUL MEAL THEIR SCANTY SUPPER WAS WITH MORE KISSES AND HUGS AND TEARS THAN MANY YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO START UPON THEIR TRAVELS AND LEAVE WELL STOCKED HOMES BEHIND THEM WOULD DEEM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF PROBABILITY
UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR
FOR HE HAD HEARD OF PEOPLE BEING DECOYED INTO STRANGE PLACES TO BE ROBBED AND MURDERED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES VERY LIKE THE PRESENT AND FOR ANYTHING HE KNEW TO THE CONTRARY BY GUIDES VERY LIKE THE MARCHIONESS HIS REGARD FOR KIT HOWEVER
WHO SAT AS MUTE AS THEY SHELLING PEAS INTO A DISH AND JUST WHEN KIT WAS LOOKING AT HER EYELASHES AND WONDERING QUITE IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART WHAT COLOUR HER EYES MIGHT BE
AFTER RECOVERING TWICE OR THRICE
OR TO TAKE A CRUISE ROUND THE WORLD IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE EVER WAS A BOX WHICH WAS OPENED AND SHUT SO MANY TIMES WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AS THAT WHICH CONTAINED HIS WARDROBE AND NECESSARIES AND CERTAINLY
I DON'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT TO TRUST IT TO ITSELF SOMEBODY OUGHT TO HAVE GONE WITH IT I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T HELP IT NOW SAID HIS MOTHER BUT IT WAS FOOLISH AND WRONG PEOPLE OUGHTN'T TO BE TEMPTED
OLD MISTER GARLAND HAD BEEN AT WORK IN IT THAT VERY MORNING KIT LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND ADMIRED AND LOOKED AGAIN AND THIS A GREAT MANY TIMES BEFORE HE COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TURN HIS HEAD ANOTHER WAY AND RING THE BELL
JUST AS THE FANCY SEIZED HIM
IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE
THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT AND MISTER ABEL WHOM THEY HAD COME TO FETCH INTO HIS
IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP AND CAN TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE PLACE THEY'VE GONE TO WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID KIT
BY THESE MEANS MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS PUSHED AND HUSTLED TO THE OFFICE AGAIN IN A MOST INGLORIOUS MANNER AND ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXHAUSTION AND DISCOMFITURE THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT
AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH
THIS PONY HAD A LITTLE PHAETON BEHIND HIM AND A MAN IN IT BUT NEITHER MAN NOR PHAETON SEEMED TO EMBARRASS HIM IN THE LEAST AS HE REARED UP ON HIS HIND LEGS OR STOPPED OR WENT ON OR STOOD STILL AGAIN OR BACKED
AND TOOK A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SIR SAID DICK
THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY
OF RICHARD SWIVELLER WHY HOW IS THIS SAID MISTER ABEL KINDLY AS HE HURRIED TOWARDS HIM YOU HAVE BEEN ILL VERY REPLIED DICK NEARLY DEAD
SAID MISSUS NUBBLES I KNOW WHO HAS BEEN PUTTING THAT IN YOUR HEAD REJOINED HER SON DISCONSOLATELY THAT'S LITTLE BETHEL AGAIN NOW I SAY MOTHER
COMMON IN STORY BOOKS TO YOUTHS OF LOW DEGREE ON THEIR FIRST VISIT TO STRANGE HOUSES THE DOOR WAS GENTLY OPENED AND A LITTLE SERVANT GIRL VERY TIDY MODEST AND DEMURE BUT VERY PRETTY TOO APPEARED I SUPPOSE YOU'RE CHRISTOPHER SIR
I'VE BEEN SUCH A TIME GONE HE'LL THINK I'M LOST MISTER ABEL INVOLUNTARILY URGED THE PONY FORWARD THE PONY IMPELLED BY SOME SECRET SYMPATHY OR SOME NEW CAPRICE BURST INTO A GREAT PACE AND NEITHER SLACKENED IT
THAT THE BRIM SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY WHEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF PROMISE AND ADVICE AND KIT HAD SAID ALL HE HAD TO SAY IN THE WAY OF ASSURANCE AND THANKFULNESS HE WAS HANDED OVER AGAIN TO THE OLD LADY
AT THIS REPLY MISTER WITHERDEN BURIED HIS NOSE IN THE FLOWERS AGAIN AND WHISPERED BEHIND THE NOSEGAY TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT HE BELIEVED THE LAD WAS AS HONEST A LAD AS NEED BE NOW SAID MISTER GARLAND WHEN THEY HAD MADE SOME FURTHER INQUIRIES OF HIM
AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PERHAPS I MAY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT YOU SO TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL PUT IT DOWN IN MY POCKET BOOK
THAT BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE STREET IN WHICH THE NOTARY LIVED SHE WAS FAIRLY WORN OUT AND EXHAUSTED AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TEARS BUT TO HAVE GOT THERE AT LAST WAS A GREAT COMFORT ESPECIALLY AS THERE WERE LIGHTS STILL BURNING IN THE OFFICE WINDOW
HE SENT ME TO SAY WOULD YOU COME DIRECTLY AND THAT HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT KIT AND COULD SAVE HIM YET AND PROVE HIS INNOCENCE WHAT DO YOU TELL ME CHILD THE TRUTH UPON MY WORD AND HONOUR I DO BUT PLEASE TO DRIVE ON QUICK PLEASE
AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS THAN HE HUNG UP THE CAGE WITH GREAT PRECIPITATION AND HASTILY EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF HIS ERRAND WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
SHE EASILY PROCURED A DIRECTION AS CARRIER PIGEONS ON BEING FIRST LET LOOSE IN A STRANGE PLACE BEAT THE AIR AT RANDOM FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SPOT FOR WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNED
SHE BEGAN TO SHAPE HER COURSE FOR THE NOTARY'S OFFICE TO WHICH SHREWDLY INQUIRING OF APPLE WOMEN AND OYSTER SELLERS AT STREET CORNERS RATHER THAN IN LIGHTED SHOPS OR OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE AT THE HAZARD OF ATTRACTING NOTICE
BUT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO AFTER THIS LONG DELAY EVERY MINUTE IS AN AGE IF EVER YOU WENT HOME FAST IN YOUR LIFE GO HOME FAST TO NIGHT DON'T STOP TO SAY ONE WORD TO ME BUT GO SHE WILL BE FOUND HERE
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY RETURNED THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY I SAY
AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE CONSEQUENTLY THE PONY BEING DETERRED BY NO CONSIDERATIONS OF DUTY OR OBEDIENCE AND NOT HAVING BEFORE HIM THE SLIGHTEST FEAR OF THE HUMAN EYE HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF
LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS
BUT AT LAST AS HE WAS SITTING UPON THE BOX THINKING ABOUT GIANTS CASTLES AND PRINCESSES TIED UP TO PEGS BY THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS AND DRAGONS BURSTING OUT FROM BEHIND GATES AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE LIKE NATURE
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES
AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE
CRIED KIT WITH A RUEFUL FACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT MOTHER I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SHE SAID IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP
HE'LL NEVER STAND STILL IF YOU CALL HIM NAMES SAID MISTER ABEL GETTING IN AND TAKING THE REINS HE'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW IF YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE HIM THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS BEEN OUT THIS LONG WHILE FOR HE HAS LOST HIS OLD DRIVER
AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT
BLEAK DARK AND PIERCING COLD IT WAS A NIGHT FOR THE WELL HOUSED AND FED TO DRAW ROUND THE BRIGHT FIRE AND THANK GOD THEY WERE AT HOME AND FOR THE HOMELESS STARVING WRETCH TO LAY HIM DOWN AND DIE
SAYS SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT SIR GOOD STRONG WHOLESOME MEDICINE AS WAS GIVEN WITH GREAT SUCCESS TO TWO IRISH LABOURERS AND A COAL HEAVER
ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
AND IF TO THE LEFT SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO MISTER BUMBLE'S ARMS SO
I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
THE MATRON OF THE WORKHOUSE TO WHICH OUR READERS HAVE BEEN ALREADY INTRODUCED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF OLIVER TWIST SAT HERSELF DOWN BEFORE A CHEERFUL FIRE IN HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND GLANCED WITH NO SMALL DEGREE OF COMPLACENCY AT A SMALL ROUND TABLE ON WHICH STOOD A TRAY OF CORRESPONDING SIZE
WHEN THE LADY BROUGHT HER EYES DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN
BUT NOW THAT FORTUNE HAD CAST IN HIS WAY A NAMELESS ORPHAN AT WHOM EVEN THE MEANEST COULD POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN HE RETORTED ON HIM WITH INTEREST THIS AFFORDS CHARMING FOOD FOR CONTEMPLATION IT SHOWS US WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING HUMAN NATURE MAY BE MADE TO BE
CHARLOTTE SEE TO THEM BUNDLES THIS MANDATE WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED WITH GREAT MAJESTY WAS OBEYED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DEMUR
AND RENDERED MISTER BUMBLE'S SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF THE PAROCHIAL CANE RATHER UNNECESSARY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE BACK KITCHEN IN COMPANY WITH A PUMP AND A SLICE OF BREAD
D'YE HEAR WORK'US SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE
THE JEW PERCEIVING THAT MISTER CHITLING WAS CONSIDERABLY ROUSED HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM THAT NOBODY WAS LAUGHING AND TO PROVE THE GRAVITY OF THE COMPANY APPEALED TO MASTER BATES THE PRINCIPAL OFFENDER
THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR
QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ITS INMATES STIRRING AT THAT EARLY HOUR OLIVER STOPPED AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN A CHILD WAS WEEDING ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS AS HE STOPPED HE RAISED HIS PALE FACE
HE WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT NO BETTER COURSE OCCURRED TO HIM JUST THEN AND AS BOTH ROSE AND MISSUS MAYLIE SIDED VERY STRONGLY WITH MISTER BROWNLOW THAT GENTLEMAN'S PROPOSITION WAS CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULD LIKE HE SAID
BRING HIM DOWN HUSH QUIET CHARLEY GENTLY TOM SCARCE SCARCE THIS BRIEF DIRECTION TO CHARLEY BATES AND HIS RECENT ANTAGONIST WAS SOFTLY AND IMMEDIATELY OBEYED THERE WAS NO SOUND OF THEIR WHEREABOUT WHEN THE DODGER DESCENDED THE STAIRS BEARING THE LIGHT IN HIS HAND
NODDING HER HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CORPSE AND SPEAKING WITH AN IDIOTIC LEER MORE GHASTLY THAN EVEN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH IN SUCH A PLACE LORD
THEY ALWAYS DIE WHEN I'M AT MEALS
NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
FOR THE BRIEFEST SPACE OF TIME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE CONCEIVED IT WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD BEEN OBSERVED HE CLOSED THE LID OF THE BOX WITH A LOUD CRASH AND LAYING HIS HAND ON A BREAD KNIFE WHICH WAS ON THE TABLE STARTED FURIOUSLY UP
THE FOLKS CALL ME A MISER MY DEAR ONLY A MISER THAT'S ALL OLIVER THOUGHT THE OLD GENTLEMAN MUST BE A DECIDED MISER TO LIVE IN SUCH A DIRTY PLACE WITH SO MANY WATCHES
WAS LATE NEXT MORNING WHEN OLIVER AWOKE FROM A SOUND LONG SLEEP THERE WAS NO OTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM BUT THE OLD JEW WHO WAS BOILING SOME COFFEE IN A SAUCEPAN FOR BREAKFAST AND WHISTLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AS HE STIRRED IT ROUND AND ROUND WITH AN IRON SPOON
THE LANDLORD OF THE HOUSE HAD NOT WITHDRAWN HIS EYE
YOU HAVE A CAT MA'AM I SEE SAID MISTER BUMBLE GLANCING AT ONE WHO IN THE CENTRE OF HER FAMILY WAS BASKING BEFORE THE FIRE AND KITTENS TOO I DECLARE I AM SO FOND OF THEM MISTER BUMBLE YOU CAN'T THINK REPLIED THE MATRON
LINED INQUIRED THE JEW WITH EAGERNESS PRETTY WELL REPLIED THE DODGER PRODUCING TWO POCKET BOOKS ONE GREEN AND THE OTHER RED NOT SO HEAVY AS THEY MIGHT BE SAID THE JEW AFTER LOOKING AT THE INSIDES CAREFULLY
FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE
AS SHE SAT DOWN HER EYES ONCE AGAIN ENCOUNTERED THOSE OF THE GALLANT BEADLE SHE COLOURED AND APPLIED HERSELF TO THE TASK OF MAKING HIS TEA AGAIN MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED LOUDER THIS TIME THAN HE HAD COUGHED YET
IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
AND IF WE COULD ONLY GET IN WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SORT I SAY IT WOULD BE CHEAP AT THAT TWENTY POUND NOTE YOU'VE GOT ESPECIALLY AS WE DON'T VERY WELL KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF IT OURSELVES AFTER EXPRESSING THIS OPINION
SAID NOAH GETTING HIS LEGS BY GRADUAL DEGREES ABROAD AGAIN
GIVING OLIVER A SHAKE AND A BOX ON THE EAR HE CALLED MY MOTHER NAMES
AND AS HE CROSSED THE ROAD WHILE SPEAKING AS IF FULLY PREPARED TO PUT HIS THREAT INTO EXECUTION THE WOMAN ROSE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER REMARK AND TRUDGED ONWARD BY HIS SIDE
WERE TAKING THEIR SUPPER IN THE LITTLE BACK PARLOUR WHEN MISTER SOWERBERRY AFTER SEVERAL DEFERENTIAL GLANCES AT HIS WIFE SAID MY DEAR HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKING UP WITH A PECULIARLY UNPROPITIOUS ASPECT
MISTER DAWKINS RECEIVED THESE HANDSOME COMPLIMENTS WITH MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND OFFERED TO CUT ANY GENTLEMAN IN COMPANY FOR THE FIRST PICTURE CARD AT A SHILLING AT A TIME NOBODY ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE AND HIS PIPE BEING BY THIS TIME SMOKED OUT
REPLIED NOAH HE SAID HE WANTED TO AH
WHICH HAD SERVED HIM IN LIEU OF COUNTERS WHISTLING MEANTIME WITH PECULIAR SHRILLNESS
HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING
REPLIED THE BEADLE AND THE COCKED HAT AND CANE HAVING BEEN BY THIS TIME ADJUSTED TO THEIR OWNER'S SATISFACTION MISTER BUMBLE AND NOAH CLAYPOLE BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH ALL SPEED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S SHOP
EXCELLENT THEN PLACING HIS FEET AGAINST THE LOW MANTELPIECE SO AS TO BRING HIS BOOTS TO ABOUT THE LEVEL OF HIS EYE HE QUIETLY RESUMED FIRST AND FOREMOST FAGUEY SAID THE HOUSEBREAKER HOW'S BILL WHAT
NOR IS THIS THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON INCIDENTAL TO SUCH A STATE IT IS AN UNDOUBTED FACT THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SENSES OF TOUCH AND SIGHT BE FOR THE TIME DEAD YET OUR SLEEPING THOUGHTS AND THE VISIONARY SCENES THAT PASS BEFORE US
AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE
RESUMED MISTER SOWERBERRY WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING HE WOULD MAKE A DELIGHTFUL MUTE MY LOVE MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE WONDERMENT
CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR
SWEET MISTER BUMBLE INQUIRED THE MATRON TAKING UP THE SUGAR BASIN VERY SWEET INDEED MA'AM REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE HE FIXED HIS EYES ON MISSUS CORNEY AS HE SAID THIS
I WASN'T ABLE TO SLEEP ANY LONGER SIR REPLIED OLIVER MEEKLY
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
HAVING UNLOOSENED THE CRAVAT OF THE MAN WHO STILL REMAINED EXTENDED ON THE GROUND SHE TOTTERED TOWARDS THE UNDERTAKER SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THEY HAVE GONE OUT FOR THE DAY HAVE THEY DONE WORK SIR INQUIRED OLIVER YES SAID THE JEW
IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
IT AT ONCE REDUCED MISTER SOWERBERRY TO BEGGING AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT MISSUS SOWERBERRY WAS MOST CURIOUS TO HEAR AFTER A SHORT DURATION THE PERMISSION WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED
THERE THERE AT THE WINDOW CLOSE BEFORE HIM SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH
AND DON'T YER SPEAK
MISTER MORRIS BOLTER THIS IS MISSUS BOLTER MISSUS BOLTER'S HUMBLE SERVANT SAID FAGIN BOWING WITH GROTESQUE POLITENESS I HOPE I SHALL KNOW HER BETTER VERY SHORTLY DO YOU HEAR THE GENTLEMAN CHARLOTTE
THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TAINTED WITH THE SMELL OF COFFINS THE RECESS BENEATH THE COUNTER IN WHICH HIS FLOCK MATTRESS WAS THRUST LOOKED LIKE A GRAVE NOR WERE THESE THE ONLY DISMAL FEELINGS WHICH DEPRESSED OLIVER
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS
AND WHEN HE WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS PRISON HE SCOWLED BOLDLY ON NOAH AND LOOKED QUITE UNDISMAYED
AH TO BE SURE MY DEAR REPLIED THE JEW
AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
ACQUIRED GREAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM HIS CLOSE OBSERVANCE OF THE GAME AND HIS ATTENTIVE PERUSAL OF MISTER CHITLING'S HAND UPON WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME AS OCCASION SERVED HE BESTOWED A VARIETY OF EARNEST GLANCES
CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY ASKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A CROWD AT THE EXECUTION THAT MORNING THIS MADE HIM WONDER MORE AND MORE
WITH A SUBTLE AND EAGER LOOK UPON HIS FACE THAT MIGHT HAVE APPERTAINED TO SOME OLD GOBLIN SO I MEAN TO BE A GENTLEMAN SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE KICKING OUT HIS LEGS AND CONTINUING A CONVERSATION THE COMMENCEMENT OF WHICH
ALONG THIS SAME FOOTPATH OLIVER WELL REMEMBERED HE HAD TROTTED BESIDE MISTER BUMBLE WHEN HE FIRST CARRIED HIM TO THE WORKHOUSE FROM THE FARM HIS WAY LAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE HIS HEART BEAT QUICKLY WHEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THIS
OR GOT HALF SMOTHERED BY ACCIDENT IN ANY ONE OF WHICH CASES THE MISERABLE LITTLE BEING WAS USUALLY SUMMONED INTO ANOTHER WORLD AND THERE GATHERED TO THE FATHERS IT HAD NEVER KNOWN IN THIS OCCASIONALLY
ORDERED HIM UPSTAIRS TO HIS DISMAL BED IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SILENCE AND STILLNESS OF THE GLOOMY WORKSHOP OF THE UNDERTAKER THAT OLIVER GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS WHICH THE DAY'S TREATMENT
BETWIXT YOU AND ME MA'AM RETURNED MISTER BUMBLE
IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS PURSUIT THAT HE WAS GREATLY STARTLED AND DISTRESSED BY A MOST UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE THE LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WHEN BUSY AT HIS BOOKS
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY NOT WHEN IT'S IN A NOTE YOU CAN'T GET RID OF RETORTED FAGIN NUMBER AND DATE TAKEN I SUPPOSE PAYMENT STOPPED AT THE BANK AH IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH TO HIM IT'LL HAVE TO GO ABROAD
OLD SALLY IS A GOING FAST WELL WHAT'S THAT TO ME ANGRILY DEMANDED THE MATRON I CAN'T KEEP HER ALIVE CAN I NO NO MISTRESS REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN NOBODY CAN SHE'S FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF HELP
THE TERRIFIED CHILDREN CRIED BITTERLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO REMAINED AS QUIET AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY DEAF TO ALL THAT PASSED MENACED THEM INTO SILENCE
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
DEAR ME SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BOTTLE GREEN COAT HASTILY RISING WITH GREAT POLITENESS I BEG YOUR PARDON YOUNG LADY I IMAGINED IT WAS SOME IMPORTUNATE PERSON WHO I BEG YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
THAT IT WAS YOU A COMING REPLIED MISSUS MANN WITH GREAT HUMILITY MISTER BUMBLE HAD A GREAT IDEA OF HIS ORATORICAL POWERS AND HIS IMPORTANCE HE HAD DISPLAYED THE ONE AND VINDICATED THE OTHER HE RELAXED
LORD WELL IT IS STRANGE THAT I WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HER AND WAS A WOMAN THEN SHOULD BE ALIVE AND MERRY NOW AND SHE LYING THERE SO COLD AND STIFF
HAVE YOU SHOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR LATELY GILES INQUIRED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED NOTHING PARTICULAR SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES COLOURING UP TO THE EYES NOR CATCHING ANY THIEVES NOR IDENTIFYING ANY HOUSE BREAKERS
IN A VERY FRIENDLY MANNER GOOD STUFF THAT OBSERVED MISTER CLAYPOLE SMACKING HIS LIPS DEAR SAID FAGIN A MAN NEED BE ALWAYS EMPTYING A TILL OR A POCKET OR A WOMAN'S RETICULE
THE JEW TOOK OUT ANOTHER SO SMALL THAT IT LAY IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME VERY MINUTE INSCRIPTION ON IT FOR THE JEW LAID IT FLAT UPON THE TABLE AND SHADING IT WITH HIS HAND PORED OVER IT LONG AND EARNESTLY
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER
AND A LARGE UPRIGHT BEAM THE OBSERVER HAD TO THRUST HIMSELF BUT COULD BY APPLYING HIS EAR TO THE PARTITION
HE IMPARTED ADDITIONAL EFFECT THEREUNTO BY BEWAILING HIS DREADFUL WOUNDS TEN TIMES LOUDER THAN BEFORE AND WHEN HE OBSERVED A GENTLEMAN IN A WHITE WAISTCOAT CROSSING THE YARD HE WAS MORE TRAGIC IN HIS LAMENTATIONS THAN EVER
AS IF REPROACHING HER TARDINESS AND URGING HER TO GREATER EXERTION THUS THEY HAD TOILED ALONG THE DUSTY ROAD TAKING LITTLE HEED OF ANY OBJECT WITHIN SIGHT
AND WITHOUT ALLOWING TIME FOR ANY OBSERVATION ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART PROCEEDED I DON'T MEAN A REGULAR MUTE TO ATTEND GROWN UP PEOPLE MY DEAR BUT ONLY FOR CHILDREN'S PRACTICE IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO HAVE A MUTE IN PROPORTION MY DEAR
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HOW PALE YOU ARE
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGH SHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS
WHAT GOOD SHOULD WE BRING ABOUT HANGING A FEW OF THEM AT LEAST IN ALL PROBABILITY SUGGESTED THE DOCTOR AND TRANSPORTING THE REST VERY GOOD REPLIED MISTER BROWNLOW SMILING
I HAVE COME OUT MYSELF TO TAKE HIM THERE SO LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE I'LL FETCH HIM DIRECTLY SAID MISSUS MANN LEAVING THE ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE OLIVER
SAID THE WOMAN DESPONDINGLY NEVER MIND WHETHER THEY'RE TWO MILE OFF OR TWENTY SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE FOR HE IT WAS BUT GET UP AND COME ON OR I'LL KICK YER AND SO I GIVE YER NOTICE
HE HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TAUNTS WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT HE HAD BORNE THE LASH WITHOUT A CRY FOR HE FELT THAT PRIDE SWELLING IN HIS HEART WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT DOWN A SHRIEK TO THE LAST
YOU'LL BE A FINE YOUNG CRACKSMAN AFORE THE OLD FILE NOW WITH THESE WORDS HE PULLED UP THE SMOCK FROCK AND WINDING IT ROUND HIS MIDDLE DREW A CHAIR TO THE FIRE AND PLACED HIS FEET UPON THE HOB
AND MY IMPRESSION MUST BE RECEIVED WITH DUE ALLOWANCE MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR COPPERFIELD MISTER JACK MALDON SHOOK HANDS WITH ME BUT NOT VERY WARMLY I BELIEVED AND WITH AN AIR OF LANGUID PATRONAGE AT WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK GREAT UMBRAGE
I PUT IT AS SHE ASKED AND OH DAVY THE TIME HAD COME WHEN MY FIRST PARTING WORDS TO YOU WERE TRUE WHEN SHE WAS GLAD TO LAY HER POOR HEAD ON HER STUPID CROSS OLD PEGGOTTY'S ARM AND SHE DIED LIKE A CHILD THAT HAD GONE TO SLEEP
MY AUNT ALWAYS EXCUSED ANY WEAKNESS OF HER OWN IN MY BEHALF BY TRANSFERRING IT IN THIS WAY TO MY POOR MOTHER BLESS ME TROTWOOD HOW YOU DO REMIND ME OF HER PLEASANTLY I HOPE AUNT SAID I HE'S AS LIKE HER DICK SAID MY AUNT EMPHATICALLY
BUT HIS LANGUOR ALTOGETHER WAS QUITE A WONDERFUL SIGHT EXCEPT WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS COUSIN ANNIE HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED THIS MORNING MISTER JACK SAID THE DOCTOR I HARDLY EVER TAKE BREAKFAST SIR HE REPLIED
PEGGOTTY MY DEAR SHE SAID THEN PUT ME NEARER TO YOU FOR SHE WAS VERY WEAK LAY YOUR GOOD ARM UNDERNEATH MY NECK SHE SAID AND TURN ME TO YOU FOR YOUR FACE IS GOING FAR OFF AND I WANT IT TO BE NEAR
AND SAT BY MY BED'S HEAD WHILE I WENT TO SLEEP A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE BURIAL I THINK IT WAS A DAY OR TWO BEFORE BUT I AM CONSCIOUS OF CONFUSION IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT HEAVY TIME WITH NOTHING TO MARK ITS PROGRESS SHE TOOK ME INTO THE ROOM
AND I AM ON MY WAY NOW TO MY MOTHER'S YOU'RE A DEVILISH AMIABLE LOOKING FELLOW COPPERFIELD
OF ITS ANCHOR BEING IN THE PUREST DEPTHS OF HIS FINE NATURE THAT THE RESPECT AND HONOUR IN WHICH I HELD HIM WERE EXALTED EVERY DAY HIS WAS NOT A LAZY TRUSTFULNESS THAT HOPED AND DID NO MORE HE HAD BEEN A MAN OF STURDY ACTION ALL HIS LIFE
A SYLLABLE THAT COMES OUT OF MY LIPS IT WOULD BE A BURNING SHAME UPON YOU EVEN NOW IF SHE AND I EXCHANGED A WORD I DON'T COMPLAIN
UNLESS WE PUT SOME INNOCENT DECEPTION UPON HIM AND CAUSED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS USEFUL OR UNLESS WE COULD PUT HIM IN THE WAY OF BEING REALLY USEFUL WHICH WOULD BE BETTER I MADE UP MY MIND TO TRY IF TRADDLES COULD HELP US
IT COMES FROM COUNTRY PLACES WHERE THERE WAS ONCE NO HARM IN IT AND IT CREEPS THROUGH THE DISMAL STREETS DEFILED AND MISERABLE AND IT GOES AWAY LIKE MY LIFE TO A GREAT SEA THAT IS ALWAYS TROUBLED AND I FEEL THAT I MUST GO WITH IT
YOUNG GENTLEMEN IS GENERALLY TIRED OF BEEF AND MUTTON HAVE A WEAL CUTLET
WITH AN IMPLORING EFFORT TO CLASP THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS ROSA DARTLE SAT LOOKING DOWN UPON HER AS INFLEXIBLE AS A FIGURE OF BRASS HER LIPS WERE TIGHTLY COMPRESSED AS IF SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST KEEP A STRONG CONSTRAINT UPON HERSELF
AND THESE ENABLED US TO COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN I THEN SIGNED TO MISTER PEGGOTTY TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS AND EMERGED FROM THEIR SHADE TO SPEAK TO HER I DID NOT APPROACH HER SOLITARY FIGURE WITHOUT TREMBLING
MY ANSWER WAS TO PASS OUT AT THE GATE IMMEDIATELY SHE MADE A HASTY GESTURE WITH HER HAND AS IF TO ENTREAT MY PATIENCE AND MY SILENCE AND TURNED TOWARDS LONDON WHENCE AS HER DRESS BETOKENED
AND SHE SAID TO ME IN HER PRETTY COAXING WAY AS IF I WERE A DOLL I USED TO THINK NOW DON'T GET UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK YOU NAUGHTY BOY IT'S SO NONSENSICAL
AS HE WOULD BE IF HE PROWLED ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY I GIVE HIM MORE MONEY THAN I CAN AFFORD AT INTERVALS WHEN HE REAPPEARS TO GO AWAY I WAS A FOOL WHEN I MARRIED HIM AND I AM SO FAR AN INCURABLE FOOL ON THAT SUBJECT
AND YOUR SHIRTS SAID MISS MURDSTONE HAVE YOU BROUGHT EM HOME YES MA'AM I HAVE BROUGHT HOME ALL MY CLOTHES THIS WAS ALL THE CONSOLATION THAT HER FIRMNESS ADMINISTERED TO ME
AND TO WATCH IT WITH UNEASINESS AND NOW I MUST CONFESS
AND SHE LOVED ME SO MUCH AND WAS SO CAPTIVATING PARTICULARLY WHEN SHE MADE JIP STAND ON HIS HIND LEGS FOR TOAST AND WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO HOLD THAT NOSE OF HIS AGAINST THE HOT TEAPOT FOR PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T THAT I FELT LIKE A SORT OF MONSTER WHO HAD GOT INTO A FAIRY'S BOWER
DISMISS THAT TERRIBLE IDEA WE CAN ALL DO SOME GOOD IF WE WILL SHE TREMBLED AND HER LIP SHOOK AND HER FACE WAS PALER AS SHE ANSWERED
AND MISTER OMER AND ANOTHER COME TO MAKE US READY AS PEGGOTTY WAS WONT TO TELL ME LONG AGO THE FOLLOWERS OF MY FATHER TO THE SAME GRAVE WERE MADE READY IN THE SAME ROOM THERE ARE MISTER MURDSTONE OUR NEIGHBOUR MISTER GRAYPER
I SHOULD BE THERE AGAIN SOON NO DOUBT I MIGHT SLEEP AGAIN PERHAPS OFTEN IN MY OLD ROOM
THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL DOOR CUT IN THE SIDE AND IT WAS ROOFED IN AND THERE WERE LITTLE WINDOWS IN IT BUT THE WONDERFUL CHARM OF IT WAS THAT IT WAS A REAL BOAT WHICH HAD NO DOUBT BEEN UPON THE WATER HUNDREDS OF TIMES
THEY HAD POSTPONED THEIR BREAKFAST ON MY ACCOUNT AND WE SAT DOWN TO TABLE TOGETHER WE HAD NOT BEEN SEATED LONG WHEN I SAW AN APPROACHING ARRIVAL IN MISSUS STRONG'S FACE BEFORE I HEARD ANY SOUND OF IT A GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK CAME TO THE GATE
BEING OBLIGED TO EXERT MYSELF NOW I GOT UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK WHETHER DORA HAD ANY IDEA THAT I WAS A PRIVATE WATCHMAN I AM UNABLE TO SAY BUT IT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON HER AND SHE NEITHER PLAYED NOR SANG ANY MORE
AND OUR BARK IS ON THE SEA THAT'S RIGHT SAID MY AUNT I AUGUR ALL SORT OF GOOD FROM YOUR SENSIBLE DECISION MADAM YOU DO US A GREAT DEAL OF HONOUR HE REJOINED HE THEN REFERRED TO A MEMORANDUM
WHICH WAS LIKE A TRIBUTARY CHANNEL TO THE STREET THE HOUSE SWARMED WITH INMATES AS WE WENT UP DOORS OF ROOMS WERE OPENED AND PEOPLE'S HEADS PUT OUT AND WE PASSED OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAIRS WHO WERE COMING DOWN
DROVE SLOWLY OFF WE FOLLOWING YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW TROT SAID MY AUNT HE IS GONE DID HE DIE IN THE HOSPITAL YES SHE SAT IMMOVABLE BESIDE ME
WHEN MISS MILLS CAME INTO THE ROOM WHO HAS DONE THIS EXCLAIMED MISS MILLS SUCCOURING HER FRIEND I REPLIED I MISS MILLS I HAVE DONE IT BEHOLD THE DESTROYER OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND HID MY FACE FROM THE LIGHT IN THE SOFA CUSHION
SHE SAT DOWN BY MY SIDE UPON MY LITTLE BED AND HOLDING MY HAND AND SOMETIMES PUTTING IT TO HER LIPS AND SOMETIMES SMOOTHING IT WITH HERS AS SHE MIGHT HAVE COMFORTED MY LITTLE BROTHER TOLD ME IN HER WAY ALL THAT SHE HAD TO TELL CONCERNING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
OBSERVED TRADDLES I THINK IT RIGHT TO SUGGEST IT NO MORE I AM HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO ANSWERED AGNES STEADILY FOR IT GIVES ME HOPE ALMOST ASSURANCE THAT WE THINK ALIKE DEAR MISTER TRADDLES AND DEAR TROTWOOD
THE REMEMBRANCE OF OLD TIMES MY DEAREST ANNIE AND SO FORTH IT'S NOT THERE THE AMIABLE OLD PROCTOR WHO'S HE DEAR ME ANNIE HOW ILLEGIBLY YOUR COUSIN MALDON WRITES AND HOW STUPID I AM DOCTOR OF COURSE AH AMIABLE INDEED
AND DID NOT GET INTO YARMOUTH BEFORE NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I LOOKED OUT FOR MISTER BARKIS BUT HE WAS NOT THERE AND INSTEAD OF HIM A FAT SHORT WINDED MERRY LOOKING LITTLE OLD MAN IN BLACK
WHICH WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BEYOND ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MISTER OMER TOOK ME BACK INTO THE PARLOUR BREATHING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY ON THE WAY HE THEN CALLED DOWN A LITTLE BREAK NECK RANGE OF STEPS BEHIND A DOOR BRING UP THAT TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER
I CONSTRUED THIS REMARK INTO AN INDICATION OF A WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MY PLACE SO I BLUSHINGLY OFFERED TO RESIGN IT WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND SIR SAID WILLIAM I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE CORRECT
AND HOW COULD SHE DO THAT WELL UNLESS SHE WENT SO THE DOCTOR PERSISTED IN MAKING THE ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AND MISTER JACK MALDON WAS TO COME BACK TO DINNER THIS CONCLUDED HE WENT TO HIS PATENT PLACE I SUPPOSE
ALACRITY DON'T HURRY DAVID SAID MISTER SHARP THERE'S TIME ENOUGH MY BOY DON'T HURRY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE FEELING TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE IF I HAD GIVEN IT A THOUGHT BUT I GAVE IT NONE UNTIL AFTERWARDS I HURRIED AWAY TO THE PARLOUR
AND WAS PRINCIPALLY USED BY COUNTRY PEOPLE TRAVELLING SHORT INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES UPON THE ROAD WE HAD NO STORY TELLING THAT EVENING AND TRADDLES INSISTED ON LENDING ME HIS PILLOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ME FOR I HAD ONE OF MY OWN
AND THAT IF HE COULD DO US OR ANY OF US ANY INJURY OR ANNOYANCE NO DOUBT HE WOULD MY AUNT REMAINED QUIET UNTIL AGAIN SOME STRAY TEARS FOUND THEIR WAY TO HER CHEEKS
OH TAKE HER TO JULIA MILLS AND GO AWAY PLEASE SO THAT IN SHORT I WAS QUITE DISTRACTED AND RAVED ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM I THOUGHT I HAD KILLED HER THIS TIME I SPRINKLED WATER ON HER FACE
NOW LET ME SEE SAID TRADDLES LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS ON THE TABLE HAVING COUNTED OUR FUNDS AND REDUCED TO ORDER A GREAT MASS OF UNINTENTIONAL CONFUSION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND OF WILFUL CONFUSION AND FALSIFICATION IN THE SECOND
DID SHE SAY WHEN YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE HER AGAIN I DEMANDED
I MUST HAVE SHOWN AS MUCH NOW IN MY FACE FOR HER EYES WERE IN A MOMENT CAST DOWN AND I SAW TEARS IN THEM TELL ME WHAT IT IS SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE I THINK SHALL I BE QUITE PLAIN AGNES LIKING HIM SO MUCH YES SHE SAID
KEEPING AS QUIETLY AS WE COULD IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSES BUT KEEPING VERY NEAR HER THERE WAS AND IS WHEN I WRITE AT THE END OF THAT LOW LYING STREET A DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN BUILDING PROBABLY AN OBSOLETE OLD FERRY HOUSE
A DISTRUST OF MYSELF WHICH HAS OFTEN BESET ME IN LIFE ON SMALL OCCASIONS WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AWAY WAS ASSUREDLY NOT STOPPED IN ITS GROWTH BY THIS LITTLE INCIDENT OUTSIDE THE CANTERBURY COACH IT WAS IN VAIN TO TAKE REFUGE IN GRUFFNESS OF SPEECH
WITH RESPECT TO THE PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE ENABLING US TO LAUNCH OUR FRAIL CANOE ON THE OCEAN OF ENTERPRISE I HAVE RECONSIDERED THAT IMPORTANT BUSINESS POINT AND WOULD BEG TO PROPOSE MY NOTES OF HAND
I WENT TO CANTERBURY FIRST THAT I MIGHT TAKE LEAVE OF AGNES AND MISTER WICKFIELD MY OLD ROOM IN WHOSE HOUSE I HAD NOT YET RELINQUISHED AND ALSO OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AGNES WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND TOLD ME THAT THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN LIKE ITSELF SINCE I HAD LEFT IT
I AM SURPRISED YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THE LETTER WAS RELUCTANTLY PRODUCED AND AS I HANDED IT TO THE OLD LADY I SAW HOW THE UNWILLING HAND FROM WHICH I TOOK IT TREMBLED NOW LET US SEE SAID MISSUS MARKLEHAM PUTTING HER GLASS TO HER EYE WHERE THE PASSAGE IS
WE TAKE IT TO BE CLEAR THAT MISTER WICKFIELD MIGHT NOW WIND UP HIS BUSINESS AND HIS AGENCY TRUST AND EXHIBIT NO DEFICIENCY OR DEFALCATION WHATEVER OH THANK HEAVEN CRIED AGNES FERVENTLY BUT SAID TRADDLES
A MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT I REALLY DON'T THINK HE GRASPED THIS SUM EVEN SO MUCH FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS AVARICE WHICH WAS INORDINATE AS IN THE HATRED HE FELT FOR COPPERFIELD
GOES INTO A CORNER KEEPING ME WITH HIM AND OPENS HIS MOUTH NO MORE I REMARK THIS BECAUSE I REMARK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS NOT BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT MYSELF OR HAVE DONE SINCE I CAME HOME AND NOW THE BELL BEGINS TO SOUND
NO MORE THAN YOU COULD CHARM ME BY YOUR SMILES YOU PURCHASED SLAVE OH HAVE SOME MERCY ON ME CRIED EMILY SHOW ME SOME COMPASSION OR I SHALL DIE MAD IT WOULD BE NO GREAT PENANCE SAID ROSA DARTLE FOR YOUR CRIMES DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THIS AS THE FIRST FALL I HAD IN LIFE WHEN I BOOKED MY PLACE AT THE COACH OFFICE I HAD HAD BOX SEAT WRITTEN AGAINST THE ENTRY AND HAD GIVEN THE BOOK KEEPER HALF A CROWN I WAS GOT UP IN A SPECIAL GREAT COAT AND SHAWL EXPRESSLY TO DO HONOUR TO THAT DISTINGUISHED EMINENCE
HE'S AS LIKE HER AS SHE WAS THAT AFTERNOON BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO FRET BLESS MY HEART HE'S AS LIKE HER AS HE CAN LOOK AT ME OUT OF HIS TWO EYES IS HE INDEED SAID MISTER DICK AND HE'S LIKE DAVID TOO SAID MY AUNT DECISIVELY HE IS VERY LIKE DAVID SAID MISTER DICK
AND NEVER WALKED SLOWLY ON ANY ACCOUNT AND FELT ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THE MORE I TIRED MYSELF THE MORE I WAS DOING TO DESERVE DORA I HAD NOT REVEALED MYSELF IN MY ALTERED CHARACTER TO DORA YET BECAUSE SHE WAS COMING TO SEE MISS MILLS IN A FEW DAYS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF MISTER JACK MALDON HAVING LATELY PROFFERED HIS OCCASIONAL SERVICES AS AN AMANUENSIS AND NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THAT OCCUPATION BUT WE SHOULD SOON PUT RIGHT WHAT WAS AMISS AND GO ON SWIMMINGLY
A REGULAR SOUND OF HAMMERING THAT KEPT A KIND OF TUNE RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT RAT TAT TAT WITHOUT ANY VARIATION WELL SAID MY CONDUCTOR TO ONE OF THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN HOW DO YOU GET ON MINNIE
AND RAISE THE VERY STONES AGAINST YOU A FRIGHTENED MURMUR WAS THE ONLY REPLY THAT REACHED MY EARS A SILENCE SUCCEEDED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO MUCH AS I DESIRED TO PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW I FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO PRESENT MYSELF
I SPEAK SHE SAID NOT DEIGNING TO TAKE ANY HEED OF THIS APPEAL AND DRAWING AWAY HER DRESS FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF EMILY'S TOUCH I SPEAK OF HIS HOME WHERE I LIVE HERE SHE SAID STRETCHING OUT HER HAND WITH HER CONTEMPTUOUS LAUGH
AND THE FEAR THAT IT MIGHT DISPLEASE HIM I COULD HAVE HELD HIM ROUND THE NECK AND CRIED I NEVER NEVER NEVER WAS SO GLAD MY DEAR STEERFORTH I AM SO OVERJOYED TO SEE YOU AND I AM REJOICED TO SEE YOU TOO HE SAID SHAKING MY HANDS HEARTILY WHY COPPERFIELD OLD BOY DON'T BE OVERPOWERED
YOU TOLD ME SO COPPERFIELD EXCELLENT SAID I AND INDEED HE WAS HE WROTE WITH EXTRAORDINARY NEATNESS DON'T YOU THINK SAID TRADDLES YOU COULD COPY WRITINGS SIR IF I GOT THEM FOR YOU MISTER DICK LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT ME
THAT I HAD HALF A MIND TO NOD TO MY OLD ENEMY THE BUTCHER AND THROW HIM FIVE SHILLINGS TO DRINK BUT HE LOOKED SUCH A VERY OBDURATE BUTCHER AS HE STOOD SCRAPING THE GREAT BLOCK IN THE SHOP AND MOREOVER HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO LITTLE IMPROVED BY THE LOSS OF A FRONT TOOTH WHICH I HAD KNOCKED OUT
WE TURNED DOWN LANES BESTREWN WITH BITS OF CHIPS AND LITTLE HILLOCKS OF SAND AND WENT PAST GAS WORKS ROPE WALKS BOAT BUILDERS YARDS SHIPWRIGHTS YARDS SHIP BREAKERS YARDS CAULKERS YARDS RIGGERS LOFTS SMITHS FORGES
TRADDLES HAVING MENTIONED NEWSPAPERS TO ME AS ONE OF HIS HOPES I HAD PUT THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND TOLD TRADDLES IN MY LETTER THAT I WISHED TO KNOW HOW I COULD QUALIFY MYSELF FOR THIS PURSUIT
THAT THE IMAGINATION OF MAN COULD CONCEIVE TO HEAR THE WIND GETTING UP OUT AT SEA TO KNOW THAT THE FOG WAS CREEPING OVER THE DESOLATE FLAT OUTSIDE AND TO LOOK AT THE FIRE AND THINK THAT THERE WAS NO HOUSE NEAR BUT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE A BOAT
TO SEE HER FOLD HER LITTLE HANDS AND HOLD THEM UP BEGGING AND PRAYING ME NOT TO BE DREADFUL ANY MORE INDEED I AM NOT GOING TO BE MY DARLING I ASSURED HER BUT DORA MY LOVE IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES THINK NOT DESPONDINGLY
HE LOOKED AT ME JUST AS HE USED TO LOOK SOMETIMES BUT I SAW NO RECOGNITION IN HIS FACE YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME I AM AFRAID SAID I MY GOD HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED IT'S LITTLE COPPERFIELD I GRASPED HIM BY BOTH HANDS AND COULD NOT LET THEM GO BUT FOR VERY SHAME
AND LOOKED GIDDILY DOWN INTO A WRETCHED YARD WHICH WAS THE COMMON DUST HEAP OF THE MANSION WE PROCEEDED TO THE TOP STOREY OF THE HOUSE TWO OR THREE TIMES BY THE WAY I THOUGHT I OBSERVED IN THE INDISTINCT LIGHT THE SKIRTS OF A FEMALE FIGURE GOING UP BEFORE US
I WAS A FOOL TO BE THE SOUL OF HONOUR SHE GAVE MY HAND A SQUEEZE AND SHOOK HER HEAD HE IS NOTHING TO ME NOW TROT LESS THAN NOTHING BUT SOONER THAN HAVE HIM PUNISHED FOR HIS OFFENCES
AND HELPING HER TO RISE SHE SEEMED TO WANT TO RISE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING AWAY BUT SHE WAS WEAK AND LEANED AGAINST A BOAT DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS WHO IS WITH ME SHE SAID FAINTLY YES
BUT THAT ONE DARK GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH THE GATEWAY HAD INSTINCTIVELY PREPARED ME FOR HER GOING NO FARTHER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS A DREARY ONE AT THAT TIME AS OPPRESSIVE SAD AND SOLITARY BY NIGHT AS ANY ABOUT LONDON
AND ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THERE WAS A TEA TRAY WITH A PAINTING ON IT OF A LADY WITH A PARASOL TAKING A WALK WITH A MILITARY LOOKING CHILD WHO WAS TRUNDLING A HOOP THE TRAY WAS KEPT FROM TUMBLING DOWN BY A BIBLE AND THE TRAY IF IT HAD TUMBLED DOWN
I AM OF THIS OPINION BECAUSE WHILE I WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER I OBSERVED HIM BEHIND A LOW WOODEN PARTITION WHICH WAS HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT VERY BUSY POURING OUT OF A NUMBER OF THOSE VESSELS INTO ONE LIKE A CHEMIST AND DRUGGIST MAKING UP A PRESCRIPTION
HER NERVES WERE A LITTLE SHAKEN SHE SAID OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN WAY TO IT GOD FORGIVE US ALL SO WE RODE BACK TO HER LITTLE COTTAGE AT HIGHGATE WHERE WE FOUND THE FOLLOWING SHORT NOTE WHICH HAD ARRIVED BY THAT MORNING'S POST
SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO THIS TASK FERVENTLY AND FAITHFULLY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER WAVER IN IT NEVER BE DIVERTED FROM IT NEVER RELINQUISH IT WHILE THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HOPE
THEN BEGAN TO CRY THAT WAS DREADFUL I FELL UPON MY KNEES BEFORE THE SOFA CARESSING HER
THAT THE MERE MECHANICAL ACQUISITION NECESSARY EXCEPT IN RARE CASES FOR THOROUGH EXCELLENCE IN IT THAT IS TO SAY A PERFECT AND ENTIRE COMMAND OF THE MYSTERY OF SHORT HAND WRITING AND READING WAS ABOUT EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY TO THE MASTERY OF SIX LANGUAGES
IF THIS WILL NOT DO EITHER DIE THERE ARE DOORWAYS AND DUST HEAPS FOR SUCH DEATHS AND SUCH DESPAIR FIND ONE AND TAKE YOUR FLIGHT TO HEAVEN I HEARD A DISTANT FOOT UPON THE STAIRS I KNEW IT I WAS CERTAIN
AND HE MUST MAKE HASTE AND GET HIMSELF READY THEN HE WENT OUT AGAIN AND THEN SHE PUT HER THIMBLE AND SCISSORS IN HER POCKET AND STUCK A NEEDLE THREADED WITH BLACK THREAD NEATLY IN THE BOSOM OF HER GOWN AND PUT ON HER OUTER CLOTHING SMARTLY
IF I COULD ORDER IT TO BE DONE I WOULD HAVE THIS GIRL WHIPPED TO DEATH AND SO SHE WOULD I HAVE NO DOUBT I WOULD NOT HAVE TRUSTED HER WITH THE RACK ITSELF WHILE THAT FURIOUS LOOK LASTED SHE SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY
AND THERE WAS SUCH A FERVENT APPEAL TO ME TO DEAL TENDERLY BY HIM EVEN IN MY INMOST THOUGHTS AND TO LET NO HARSH CONSTRUCTION FIND ANY PLACE AGAINST HIM SHE WAS AT ONCE SO PROUD OF HIM AND DEVOTED TO HIM YET SO COMPASSIONATE AND SORRY AND SO RELIANT UPON ME TO BE SO TOO
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW HOW THE WORLD CHANGES EVERY DAY SAID MISSUS CREAKLE AND HOW THE PEOPLE IN IT PASS AWAY BUT WE ALL HAVE TO LEARN IT DAVID SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE YOUNG SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE OLD SOME OF US AT ALL TIMES OF OUR LIVES
IN THE MEANWHILE YOU MUST TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW AND NOT AS A SCHOOLBOY I WILL AUNT IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME PURSUED MY AUNT THAT A LITTLE CHANGE AND A GLIMPSE OF LIFE OUT OF DOORS MAY BE USEFUL IN HELPING YOU TO KNOW YOUR OWN MIND AND FORM A COOLER JUDGEMENT
AND WAS GOING TO BE THE WIFE OF AS GOOD A MAN AS YOU OR ANY LADY IN THE WORLD CAN EVER MARRY IF YOU LIVE IN HIS HOME AND KNOW HIM YOU KNOW PERHAPS WHAT HIS POWER WITH A WEAK VAIN GIRL MIGHT BE I DON'T DEFEND MYSELF BUT I KNOW WELL AND HE KNOWS WELL
SHE DID NOT RAISE HER VOICE ABOVE HER BREATH OR ADDRESS US BUT SAID THIS TO THE NIGHT SKY THEN STOOD PROFOUNDLY QUIET
AND THEN MY SOLITARY HOME THAT MY HEART WAS TOO FULL FOR SPEECH TRADDLES PRETENDED FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO BE BUSILY LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS NEXT MISS TROTWOOD SAID TRADDLES THAT PROPERTY OF YOURS
IS TO ABJURE THAT OCCUPATION FOR EVERMORE MADAM REPLIED MISTER MICAWBER IT IS MY INTENTION TO REGISTER SUCH A VOW ON THE VIRGIN PAGE OF THE FUTURE MISSUS MICAWBER WILL ATTEST IT I TRUST
I'LL OWN THAT HE'S WITH A HARSH SET HE PINES FOR KINDNESS AS WELL AS LOVE AND A KIND WORD FROM YOU WOULD BE HIS BEST MEDICINE DON'T MIND MISSUS DEAN'S CRUEL CAUTIONS BUT BE GENEROUS AND CONTRIVE TO SEE HIM
HOW THE BOY WOULD DO
MASTER HEATHCLIFF I RESUMED HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALL CATHERINE'S KINDNESS TO YOU LAST WINTER WHEN YOU AFFIRMED YOU LOVED HER
AND WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BED HE BEGGED TO SLEEP WITH HARETON AND HIS PETITION WAS GRANTED FOR ONCE CATHERINE STOLE OUT BEFORE BREAK OF DAY SHE DARED NOT TRY THE DOORS LEST THE DOGS SHOULD RAISE AN ALARM SHE VISITED THE EMPTY CHAMBERS AND EXAMINED THEIR WINDOWS
WHICH IT WAS NO EASY TASK TO SUPPRESS I ROSE AND FROM A GENTLEMANLY IDEA OF RELIEVING HIS EMBARRASSMENT TOOK UP MY STATION IN THE DOORWAY SURVEYING THE EXTERNAL PROSPECT AS I STOOD HE FOLLOWED MY EXAMPLE AND LEFT THE ROOM BUT PRESENTLY REAPPEARED
WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE THIS SEPARATION AND YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME YOU HAVE NO REASON TO DISLIKE ME YOU ALLOW YOURSELF DEAR UNCLE SEND ME A KIND NOTE TO MORROW
AS WELL AS THE ESTATE TO HIS SON OR RATHER HIMSELF YET WHY HE DID NOT WAIT TILL HIS DECEASE WAS A PUZZLE TO MY MASTER BECAUSE IGNORANT HOW NEARLY HE AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD QUIT THE WORLD TOGETHER HOWEVER HE FELT THAT HIS WILL HAD BETTER BE ALTERED
NAUGHT NAUGHT HE SAID AND BROKE AWAY TO ENJOY HIS GRIEF AND ANGER IN SOLITUDE HEATHCLIFF GAZED AFTER HIM AND SIGHED IT WILL BE ODD IF I THWART MYSELF HE MUTTERED UNCONSCIOUS THAT I WAS BEHIND HIM
THAN WHEN WE SEPARATED IN WINTER IF YOU BE I'M CERTAIN ONE THING IS NOT STRONGER YOUR REGARD FOR ME SPEAK ARE YOU THE TEARS GUSHED FROM LINTON'S EYES AS HE ANSWERED YES YES I AM
FOR TWO PEOPLE MISS CATHY AND JOSEPH THE SERVANT YOU SAW HIM I DARESAY UP YONDER HE WAS AND IS YET MOST LIKELY THE WEARISOMEST SELF RIGHTEOUS PHARISEE
THEN SHE BEGAN DESCRIBING WITH HYSTERICAL EMOTION THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON HER TO SEE BLACK AND STARTED AND TREMBLED
AND SEEMED SO EARNEST IN PURSUING HIS OBJECT I COULD NOT PICTURE A FATHER TREATING A DYING CHILD AS TYRANNICALLY AND WICKEDLY AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNED HEATHCLIFF HAD TREATED HIM TO COMPEL THIS APPARENT EAGERNESS
THEN MASTER LINTON HAS FORGOT THE FIRST INJUNCTION OF HIS UNCLE I OBSERVED HE BID US KEEP ON THE GRANGE LAND AND HERE WE ARE OFF AT ONCE WELL WE'LL TURN OUR HORSES HEADS ROUND WHEN WE REACH HIM
THERE WAS A RESTLESS ANXIOUS EXPRESSION IN HIS COUNTENANCE I HAD NEVER REMARKED THERE BEFORE AND HE LOOKED SPARER IN PERSON HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON PERCEIVING HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED TO THE KITCHEN SO THAT I REMAINED ALONE
STRIVING TO DETAIN HER BUT AT THAT ANNOUNCEMENT SHE HASTILY DISENGAGED HERSELF AND WHISTLED TO MINNY WHO OBEYED HER LIKE A DOG I'LL BE HERE NEXT THURSDAY SHE CRIED SPRINGING TO THE SADDLE GOOD BYE
AND THE COLD BLUE SKY WAS HALF HIDDEN BY CLOUDS DARK GREY STREAMERS RAPIDLY MOUNTING FROM THE WEST AND BODING ABUNDANT RAIN
I WAS NOT AWARE THERE WERE EAVESDROPPERS MUTTERED THE DETECTED VILLAIN WORTHY MISSUS DEAN I LIKE YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE YOUR DOUBLE DEALING HE ADDED ALOUD
I HAD A LONG TALK WITH ZILLAH ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO A LITTLE BEFORE YOU CAME
AND HE FIXED ON HER FEATURES HIS RAISED EYES THAT SEEMED DILATING WITH ECSTASY HE DIED BLISSFULLY MISTER LOCKWOOD HE DIED SO KISSING HER CHEEK HE MURMURED AM GOING TO HER AND YOU DARLING CHILD SHALL COME TO US AND NEVER STIRRED OR SPOKE AGAIN
SO THEY KEPT CLEAR OF HIM HE WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE SEEN AFTER THEIR GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS
I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW YOU MANAGE TO DOZE OUT OF DOORS IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT I HEARD MY FATHER HE GASPED GLANCING UP TO THE FROWNING NAB ABOVE US YOU ARE SURE NOBODY SPOKE
LOUD AND BITTER BUT JOSEPH ASKED WHAT WE COULD BE THINKING OF TO ROAR IN THAT WAY OVER A SAINT IN HEAVEN HE TOLD ME TO PUT ON MY CLOAK AND RUN TO GIMMERTON FOR THE DOCTOR AND THE PARSON
SHE TOLD ME THAT HER ANGUISH HAD AT LAST SPURRED LINTON TO INCUR THE RISK OF LIBERATING HER SHE HEARD THE MEN I SENT DISPUTING AT THE DOOR AND SHE GATHERED THE SENSE OF HEATHCLIFF'S ANSWER IT DROVE HER DESPERATE
AND CATHERINE A FAST FROM DINNER OR SUPPER BUT IT WAS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF AMUSEMENTS TO RUN AWAY TO THE MOORS IN THE MORNING AND REMAIN THERE ALL DAY
HE HAD SUMMUT TO DO I SHALL BID FATHER GOOD NIGHT FIRST SAID CATHERINE PUTTING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK BEFORE WE COULD HINDER HER THE POOR THING DISCOVERED HER LOSS DIRECTLY SHE SCREAMED OUT
I SAID HEATHCLIFF FORCED ME TO GO IN WHICH WAS NOT QUITE TRUE I UTTERED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AGAINST LINTON NOR DID I DESCRIBE ALL HIS FATHER'S BRUTAL CONDUCT MY INTENTIONS BEING TO ADD NO BITTERNESS IF I COULD HELP IT TO HIS ALREADY OVER FLOWING CUP
OH INDEED YOU'RE TIRED OF BEING BANISHED FROM THE WORLD ARE YOU HE SAID BUT IF YOU BE COMING TO PLEAD OFF PAYING FOR A PLACE YOU WON'T OCCUPY YOUR JOURNEY IS USELESS I NEVER RELENT IN EXACTING MY DUE FROM ANY ONE I'M COMING TO PLEAD OFF NOTHING ABOUT IT I EXCLAIMED
AND I WENT ON INTENDING TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE TO OPEN IT BUT THE KNOCK WAS REPEATED NOT LOUD AND STILL IMPORTUNATELY I PUT THE JUG ON THE BANISTER AND HASTENED TO ADMIT HIM MYSELF THE HARVEST MOON SHONE CLEAR OUTSIDE
HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN THE SUBJECTS SHE STARTED AND HIS EQUAL INCAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HER ENTERTAINMENT WERE SO OBVIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER DISAPPOINTMENT AN INDEFINITE ALTERATION HAD COME OVER HIS WHOLE PERSON AND MANNER
AND ISABELLA EMPTIED A PLATEFUL OF CAKES INTO HER LAP AND EDGAR STOOD GAPING AT A DISTANCE AFTERWARDS THEY DRIED AND COMBED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR
AND OFTEN FROM THE SIDE OF MY EYE I COULD DETECT HER RAISING A HAND AND BRUSHING SOMETHING OFF HER CHEEK I GAZED ROUND FOR A MEANS OF DIVERTING HER THOUGHTS ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD ROSE A HIGH ROUGH BANK
EXCLAIMED MISTER LINTON TURNING FROM ME TO CATHERINE I'VE UNDERSTOOD FROM SHIELDERS THAT WAS THE CURATE SIR THAT HE LETS HER GROW UP IN ABSOLUTE HEATHENISM BUT WHO IS THIS WHERE DID SHE PICK UP THIS COMPANION OHO
SHE HELD HER FROCK AND HE FILLED IT WITH THE FIRST THAT CAME TO HAND
AND LEAVE TO JOIN YOU ANYWHERE YOU PLEASE EXCEPT AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE I BELIEVE AN INTERVIEW WOULD CONVINCE YOU THAT MY FATHER'S CHARACTER IS NOT MINE HE AFFIRMS I AM MORE YOUR NEPHEW THAN HIS SON
YOU SMILE BUT WHY DO YOU LOOK SO LIVELY AND INTERESTED WHEN I TALK ABOUT HER
HER COUSIN WAS VERY ILL WE KNOW THAT ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF BUT HIS LIFE IS NOT WORTH A FARTHING AND I WON'T SPEND A FARTHING ON HIM BUT I CANNOT TELL HOW TO DO SHE SAID AND IF NOBODY WILL HELP ME HE'LL DIE
HOW COULD YOU LIE SO GLARINGLY AS TO AFFIRM I HATED THE POOR CHILD AND INVENT BUGBEAR STORIES TO TERRIFY HER FROM MY DOOR STONES CATHERINE LINTON THE VERY NAME WARMS ME MY BONNY LASS
AND SAYING WHY CANST THOU NOT ALWAYS BE A GOOD LASS CATHY
YOU ESPECIALLY THE ELDER AND LESS SENSITIVE AS IT TURNS OUT I'VE GOT YOUR LETTERS
HE DREAMS OF YOU DAY AND NIGHT AND CANNOT BE PERSUADED THAT YOU DON'T HATE HIM SINCE YOU NEITHER WRITE NOR CALL I CLOSED THE DOOR AND ROLLED A STONE TO ASSIST THE LOOSENED LOCK IN HOLDING IT AND SPREADING MY UMBRELLA
WAS OUT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE AND HE HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS FOR HIS RE ENTRANCE AND THEN MISTER GREEN TOLD HIM HE HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE VILLAGE THAT MUST BE DONE BUT HE WOULD BE AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE BEFORE MORNING THE FOUR MEN CAME BACK UNACCOMPANIED ALSO
CONTINUED HE SHUNNING HER PUZZLED GAZE AND GIVE HIM MY THANKS FOR PERMITTING YOU TO COME MY BEST THANKS CATHERINE AND AND IF YOU DID MEET MY FATHER AND HE ASKED YOU ABOUT ME
BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ACCOMPANY CATHERINE HE SAID IN SUMMER PERHAPS THEY MIGHT MEET MEANTIME HE WISHED HIM TO CONTINUE WRITING AT INTERVALS AND ENGAGED TO GIVE HIM WHAT ADVICE AND COMFORT HE WAS ABLE BY LETTER
TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS
HE REPLIED AND THERE'S A LAD HERE HE ADDED MAKING A CLUTCH AT ME WHO LOOKS AN OUT AND OUTER
BECAUSE I WAS CERTAIN OF SHOWERS SHE REFUSED AND I UNWILLINGLY DONNED A CLOAK
DESTITUTE OF CASH AND FRIENDS CANNOT DISTURB HIS POSSESSION NOBODY SAID ZILLAH EVER APPROACHED HER DOOR EXCEPT THAT ONCE BUT I AND NOBODY ASKED ANYTHING ABOUT HER
CATHY BEGAN TO SEEK SOLACE IN LOOKING FOR BILBERRIES AND SHARING THE PRODUCE OF HER RESEARCHES WITH ME SHE DID NOT OFFER THEM TO HIM FOR SHE SAW FURTHER NOTICE WOULD ONLY WEARY AND ANNOY
INSTEAD OF LEAVING CATHERINE'S FORTUNE AT HER OWN DISPOSAL HE DETERMINED TO PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES FOR HER USE DURING LIFE AND FOR HER CHILDREN IF SHE HAD ANY AFTER HER BY THAT MEANS IT COULD NOT FALL TO MISTER HEATHCLIFF SHOULD LINTON DIE
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE SAT A LITTLE DOG SHAKING ITS PAW AND YELPING WHICH FROM THEIR MUTUAL ACCUSATIONS WE UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD NEARLY PULLED IN TWO BETWEEN THEM THE IDIOTS THAT WAS THEIR PLEASURE TO QUARREL WHO SHOULD HOLD A HEAP OF WARM HAIR
BUT HIS UNCLE'S KIND REMEMBRANCE DELIGHTED HIM AND HE HOPED TO MEET HIM SOMETIMES IN HIS RAMBLES AND PERSONALLY TO PETITION THAT HIS COUSIN AND HE MIGHT NOT REMAIN LONG SO UTTERLY DIVIDED THAT PART OF HIS LETTER WAS SIMPLE
SHE WEPT TO MISS ONE EVENING BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU FELT THEN THAT SHE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES TOO GOOD TO YOU AND NOW YOU BELIEVE THE LIES YOUR FATHER TELLS THOUGH YOU KNOW HE DETESTS YOU BOTH AND YOU JOIN HIM AGAINST HER THAT'S FINE GRATITUDE IS IT NOT
AND FARMING HIS BIT OF LAND HIMSELF
AND THE CONGRATULATION ON THEIR LONG POSTPONED MEETING TO AN ANXIOUS INQUIRY WHETHER HE WERE WORSE THAN USUAL NO BETTER BETTER HE PANTED TREMBLING
SUCH AS I NEVER SAW A CHILD TAKE UP BEFORE AND SHE PUT ALL OF US PAST OUR PATIENCE FIFTY TIMES AND OFTENER IN A DAY FROM THE HOUR SHE CAME DOWN STAIRS TILL THE HOUR SHE WENT TO BED WE HAD NOT A MINUTE'S SECURITY
IF NOT I'LL GO CATHERINE AMUSED HERSELF WITH DANCING TO AND FRO BEFORE THE DOOR
SHE CRIED IN A TONE OF DISGUST
MAKING AN EFFORT AT CHEERFULNESS YOU RECOLLECT THE TWO DAYS WE AGREED TO SPEND IN THE PLACE AND WAY EACH THOUGHT PLEASANTEST THIS IS NEARLY YOURS ONLY THERE ARE CLOUDS BUT THEN THEY ARE SO SOFT AND MELLOW
AND SHE MADE NO SCRUPLE OF PROPOSING PRESENTLY TO DEPART THAT PROPOSAL UNEXPECTEDLY ROUSED LINTON FROM HIS LETHARGY AND THREW HIM INTO A STRANGE STATE OF AGITATION
I HAD GONE DOWN STAIRS AT THREE O'CLOCK TO FETCH A JUG OF WATER AND WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL WITH IT IN MY HAND WHEN A SHARP KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR MADE ME JUMP OH IT IS GREEN I SAID RECOLLECTING MYSELF
EARNSHAW BLUSHED CRIMSON WHEN HIS COUSIN MADE THIS REVELATION OF HIS PRIVATE LITERARY ACCUMULATIONS AND STAMMERED AN INDIGNANT DENIAL OF HER ACCUSATIONS
AND LAPSED INTO AN ASPECT OF ABSTRACTED SADNESS NEITHER CARING NOR KNOWING WHETHER WE REMARKED HER MISSUS HEATHCLIFF I SAID AFTER SITTING SOME TIME MUTE YOU ARE NOT AWARE THAT I AM AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
AND NOW GUESS WHAT YOUR GOOD CHILDREN WERE DOING ISABELLA I BELIEVE SHE IS ELEVEN A YEAR YOUNGER THAN CATHY LAY SCREAMING AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM SHRIEKING AS IF WITCHES WERE RUNNING RED HOT NEEDLES INTO HER EDGAR STOOD ON THE HEARTH WEEPING SILENTLY
OR FIND US BY OURSELVES SEEKING ENTERTAINMENT IN YELLING AND SOBBING AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND DIVIDED BY THE WHOLE ROOM
SHE'S A BEAUTY IT IS TRUE BUT NOT AN ANGEL
THE FRONT DOOR STOOD OPEN BUT THE JEALOUS GATE WAS FASTENED AS AT MY LAST VISIT
AND THE ROSE BUSHES AND BLACK BERRY STRAGGLERS COULD YIELD NO ASSISTANCE IN RE ASCENDING I LIKE A FOOL DIDN'T RECOLLECT THAT TILL I HEARD HER LAUGHING AND EXCLAIMING YOU'LL HAVE TO FETCH THE KEY OR ELSE I MUST RUN ROUND TO THE PORTER'S LODGE
OR A FUNGUS SPREADING ITS BRIGHT ORANGE AMONG THE HEAPS OF BROWN FOLIAGE AND EVER AND ANON HER HAND WAS LIFTED TO HER AVERTED FACE
BLUSTERED ROUND THE HOUSE AND ROARED IN THE CHIMNEY IT SOUNDED WILD AND STORMY YET IT WAS NOT COLD AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER I A LITTLE REMOVED FROM THE HEARTH
I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO DEPART WITHOUT SEEING MISTER HEATHCLIFF AND BRING A RESCUE FOR MY YOUNG LADY FROM THE GRANGE
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO SUMMER DREW TO AN END AND EARLY AUTUMN
I DREW MY CHARGE UNDERNEATH FOR THE RAIN BEGAN TO DRIVE THROUGH THE MOANING BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND WARNED US TO AVOID DELAY OUR HURRY PREVENTED ANY COMMENT ON THE ENCOUNTER WITH HEATHCLIFF AS WE STRETCHED TOWARDS HOME BUT I DIVINED INSTINCTIVELY
AND THEN MY SOCIETY WAS OBVIOUSLY LESS DESIRABLE THAN HIS ON AN AFTERNOON IN OCTOBER OR THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER A FRESH WATERY AFTERNOON WHEN THE TURF AND PATHS WERE RUSTLING WITH MOIST WITHERED LEAVES
FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING FRAME WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT
AND ZILLAH WILLINGLY ACQUIESCED BEING A NARROW MINDED SELFISH WOMAN CATHERINE EVINCED A CHILD'S ANNOYANCE AT THIS NEGLECT REPAID IT WITH CONTEMPT AND THUS ENLISTED MY INFORMANT AMONG HER ENEMIES AS SECURELY AS IF SHE HAD DONE HER SOME GREAT WRONG
WHISPERED BACK MY COMPANION ANXIOUSLY
BUT I BESPOKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF IT MYSELF HOW CHANGED I FOUND HIM EVEN IN THOSE FEW DAYS HE LAY AN IMAGE OF SADNESS AND RESIGNATION AWAITING HIS DEATH VERY YOUNG HE LOOKED
ON ARRIVING THERE HOWEVER A LITTLE HERD BOY DESPATCHED AS A MESSENGER TOLD US THAT
AND RIDING OVER TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO INFORM MY LANDLORD THAT I SHALL SPEND THE NEXT SIX MONTHS IN LONDON AND IF HE LIKES HE MAY LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER TENANT TO TAKE THE PLACE AFTER OCTOBER
AND BIDDING ME MARCH DIRECTLY SECURED THE DOOR AGAIN
EVERY OBJECT SHE SAW THE MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD APPEARED TO DELIGHT HER AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TOOK PLACE ABOUT HER EXCEPT THE PREPARING FOR THE BURIAL AND THE PRESENCE OF THE MOURNERS I THOUGHT SHE WAS HALF SILLY FROM HER BEHAVIOUR WHILE THAT WENT ON
SHE THINKS CATHERINE HAUGHTY AND DOES NOT LIKE HER I CAN GUESS BY HER TALK
I DID CALL HIM ONCE AND HE THREATENED TO STRANGLE HER IF SHE WAS NOT QUIET BUT SHE BEGAN AGAIN THE INSTANT HE LEFT THE ROOM MOANING AND GRIEVING ALL NIGHT LONG THOUGH I SCREAMED FOR VEXATION THAT I COULDN'T SLEEP
I'LL TELL HIM THAT YOU SAY SO LINTON I COULDN'T AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OBSERVED MY YOUNG LADY WONDERING AT HIS PERTINACIOUS ASSERTION OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN UNTRUTH AND BE HERE AGAIN NEXT THURSDAY
I SHOULD CONJECTURE HIM TO BE FAR WORSE LINTON HERE STARTED FROM HIS SLUMBER IN BEWILDERED TERROR AND ASKED IF ANY ONE HAD CALLED HIS NAME NO SAID CATHERINE UNLESS IN DREAMS
AND HEARD OUR TALK FROM OUTSIDE NOW ENTERED JOSEPH WAS FAIN I BELIEVE OF THE LAD'S REMOVAL
THOUGH HIS ACTUAL AGE WAS THIRTY NINE ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM TEN YEARS YOUNGER AT LEAST HE THOUGHT OF CATHERINE FOR HE MURMURED HER NAME I TOUCHED HIS HAND AND SPOKE CATHERINE IS COMING DEAR MASTER I WHISPERED SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL AND WILL BE HERE I HOPE TO NIGHT
SUMMER WAS ALREADY PAST ITS PRIME WHEN EDGAR RELUCTANTLY YIELDED HIS ASSENT TO THEIR ENTREATIES
THE YOUNG MAN EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT TOO BAD THAT HE SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT FOR HIS IGNORANCE AND THEN LAUGHED AT FOR TRYING TO REMOVE IT I HAD A SIMILAR NOTION AND REMEMBERING MISSUS DEAN'S ANECDOTE OF HIS FIRST ATTEMPT AT ENLIGHTENING THE DARKNESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN REARED I OBSERVED
THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID
IS MISTER HEATHCLIFF OUT I INQUIRED PERCEIVING THAT THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAD NO POWER TO SYMPATHIZE WITH HIS COUSIN'S MENTAL TORTURES HE'S IN THE COURT HE REPLIED TALKING TO DOCTOR KENNETH WHO SAYS UNCLE IS DYING TRULY AT LAST
HINDLEY'S MANIFESTATION OF SCORN WHILE HIS FATHER WAS NEAR ROUSED THE OLD MAN TO A FURY HE SEIZED HIS STICK TO STRIKE HIM
AND YOU CAN GET THE KEY IF YOU CHOOSE I SAID YES WHEN I AM UP STAIRS HE ANSWERED BUT I CAN'T WALK UP STAIRS NOW IN WHAT APARTMENT IS IT I ASKED OH HE CRIED I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT IS IT IS OUR SECRET
THAT WAS YESTERDAY I SAID THEY WERE MINE TOO AND TRIED TO GET THEM FROM HER THE SPITEFUL THING WOULDN'T LET ME SHE PUSHED ME OFF AND HURT ME I SHRIEKED OUT THAT FRIGHTENS HER
AFTER PRETENDING SUCH AFFECTION AND HAVING REASON TO WORSHIP HER ALMOST
AND CONTINUED HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE SAME DISREGARD TO COMMON FORMS OF POLITENESS AS BEFORE NEVER RETURNING MY BOW AND GOOD MORNING BY THE SLIGHTEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT SHE DOES NOT SEEM SO AMIABLE I THOUGHT AS MISSUS DEAN WOULD PERSUADE ME TO BELIEVE
AT LAST OUR
HAVING CALLED AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO GET HIS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO BEHAVE HE HAD SOLD HIMSELF TO MISTER HEATHCLIFF THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DELAY IN OBEYING MY MASTER'S SUMMONS
AND AS THE DOOR WAS LOCKED SHE PROPOSED SCRAMBLING DOWN TO RECOVER IT I BID HER BE CAUTIOUS LEST SHE GOT A FALL AND SHE NIMBLY DISAPPEARED BUT THE RETURN WAS NO SUCH EASY MATTER THE STONES WERE SMOOTH AND NEATLY CEMENTED
AND DOOMED TO SOLITUDE OR THE SOCIETY OF THOSE WHO NEVER DID AND NEVER WILL LIKE ME HOW CAN I BE CHEERFUL AND WELL EDGAR THOUGH HE FELT FOR THE BOY COULD NOT CONSENT TO GRANT HIS REQUEST
I FEEL LIKE DEATH AND SHE LOOKED LIKE IT TOO I GAVE HER A LITTLE WINE
AND WHEELED HER TO THE FIRE AND I LEFT HER AS MERRY AS SHE COULD BE DIVIDING HER FOOD BETWEEN THE LITTLE DOG AND SKULKER WHOSE NOSE SHE PINCHED AS HE ATE AND KINDLING A SPARK OF SPIRIT IN THE VACANT BLUE EYES OF THE LINTONS A DIM REFLECTION FROM HER OWN ENCHANTING FACE
NOT FIGURATIVELY BUT ACTUALLY THOUGH HARETON HAS MADE HIM A STANDING JEST FOR SIX WEEKS AND I HAVE USED MORE SERIOUS MEASURES AND ATTEMPTED TO FRIGHTEN HIM OUT OF HIS IDIOTCY HE GETS WORSE DAILY AND HE'LL BE UNDER THE SOD BEFORE SUMMER UNLESS YOU RESTORE HIM
EARNEST RECONNOITRING CONVINCED THEM ALL THAT NO INDIANS WERE IN THE POULTRY YARD ROBERT WENT IN FIVE MINUTES HE CAME BACK PALE BUT WITH MANY FEATHERS LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS JOLLY SERIOUS
TURNING WITH A BITTER SMILE TO THE OTHER RED INDIANS BUILD WE THE FIRE SHOUTED HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT ONCE A DOZEN READY VOLUNTEERS STARTED TO LOOK FOR FUEL
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
AND COME AND HAVE HIS NICE BREMMILK FORTUNATELY THE SUN SET AS THEY REACHED THE DOORSTEP THE BICYCLE DISAPPEARED AND MARTHA WAS SEEN TO CARRY INTO THE HOUSE THE REAL LIVE DARLING SLEEPY TWO YEAR OLD LAMB THE GROWN UP LAMB NAMELESS HENCE FORTH
CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
AND JANE TOOK A VERY LITTLE COURAGE AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT SUNSET COULDN'T BE FAR OFF NOW THE MOAT IS DREADFULLY THIN SAID ANTHEA BUT THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE CASTLE EVEN IF THEY DO SWIM OVER
HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND PUTTING ONE EYE TO THE LEAD HOLE OF COURSE THE HOLES GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GATE HOUSE THAT'S FOR WHEN THE ENEMY HAS GOT PAST THE DOOR AND THE PORTCULLIS AND ALMOST ALL IS LOST HERE HAND ME THE POT
THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAD DONE IT AGAIN FOR THE PSAMMEAD WHICH WAS VERY CROSS AND SLEEPY SAID OH DON'T BOTHER ME YOU'VE HAD YOUR WISH I DIDN'T KNOW IT SAID CYRIL
HE PEEPED INTO THE UPPER ROOM THE MAN WAS THERE AND IT WAS JAKIN ALL DRIPPING WITH MOAT WATER AND HE WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH THE MACHINERY WHICH ROBERT FELT SURE WORKED THE DRAWBRIDGE ROBERT BANGED THE DOOR SUDDENLY
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
EATEN WITH WATER FROM THE DEEP WELL IN THE COURTYARD DRUNK OUT OF HORNS
BLANK MISERY FELL LIKE A PALL ON THE FOUR OTHERS THE LAMB
AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
THIS UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL PLEASED THEM VERY MUCH HASTILY TELLING HER NOT TO BE A GOOSE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY A GAME THE FOUR BLANKETED FEATHERED REALLY AND TRULY REDSKINS WENT BOLDLY OUT TO MEET THE FOE I SAY BOLDLY
I DO WANT THE JUG GOT SAID ANTHEA SOFTLY YOU WILL GO WON'T YOU WELL JUST FOR THIS ONCE I DON'T MIND BUT MIND YOU DON'T GET INTO NONE OF YOUR OUTRAGEOUS MISCHIEF WHILE I'M GONE THAT'S ALL
I'D GIVE SOMETHING FOR A JOLLY GOOD BOILING KETTLE OF LEAD
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS UP TO SOME MISCHIEF SAID MARTHA DUMPING DOWN A SALT CELLAR WITH A BANG DON'T BE CROSS MARTHA DEAR SAID ANTHEA I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A NEW ONE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN YOU MIGHT LET BOBS AND ME COME WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GIRLS THIS WAS REALLY RATHER NOBLE OF CYRIL
YOU SEE HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE INDIANS THEY WOULD BE ENTIRELY HIS OWN FAULT SO HE DID NOT WISH TO BELIEVE IN THEM AND TRYING NOT TO BELIEVE THINGS WHEN IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST SURE THEY ARE TRUE IS AS BAD FOR THE TEMPER AS ANYTHING I KNOW
YE SEEK A POW WOW HE SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH I AM GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE MIGHTY TRIBE OF ROCK DWELLERS AND I SAID ANTHEA WITH A SUDDEN INSPIRATION AM THE BLACK PANTHER
TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
SO YOU'VE FORGOTTEN SAID THE PSAMMEAD BEGINNING TO BURROW NEVER MIND YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH AND I WISH YOU JOY OF IT A NICE THING YOU'VE LET YOURSELVES IN FOR WE ALWAYS DO SOMEHOW SAID JANE SADLY
AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
WITHERED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH A GLANCE AND THEN SAID TO THE LADY WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE QUITE FRIENDLY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL RIDE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE CROSS ROADS IT IS GETTING LATE AND THERE ARE TRAMPS ABOUT
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
THE GROWN UP LAMB OR HILARY AS I SUPPOSE ONE MUST NOW CALL HIM FIXED HIS PUMP AND BLEW UP THE TYRE THE PUNCTURED STATE OF IT WAS SOON EVIDENT I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COTTAGE SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE ONE COULD GET A PAIL OF WATER SAID THE LAMB
SHE HAD A WHITE TOWEL TIED TO A WALKING STICK THIS WAS A FLAG OF TRUCE AND SHE WAVED IT IN THE HOPE THAT THE INDIANS WOULD KNOW WHAT IT WAS APPARENTLY THEY DID FOR ONE WHO WAS BROWNER THAN THE OTHERS STEPPED FORWARD
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
SO THAT THEY WERE THE CENTRE OF A CROWD OF DARK CRUEL FACES IT'S NO GO WHISPERED ROBERT I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE WE MUST MAKE A BOLT FOR THE PSAMMEAD IT MIGHT HELP US IF IT DOESN'T WELL
WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
THIS WAS PAID FOR OUT OF THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS WHICH HAD BEEN EARNED BY ROBERT WHEN HE WAS A GIANT FOR THE LAMB IT APPEARED HAD UNFORTUNATELY NO MONEY ABOUT HIM THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE OTHERS BUT IT IS A THING THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN TO THE MOST GROWN UP OF US HOWEVER
JUST AS HE WAS PUTTING AWAY THE RESERVE BISCUITS IN A SORT OF LITTLE STONE CUPBOARD WITHOUT A DOOR A SUDDEN SOUND MADE HIM DROP THREE IT WAS THE LOUD FIERCE CRY OF A TRUMPET YOU SEE
THAT'S THAT BEAST JAKIN SAID ROBERT THERE'S STILL THE PORTCULLIS I'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT'S WORKED FROM LOWER DOWN AND NOW THE DRAWBRIDGE RANG AND ECHOED HOLLOWLY TO THE HOOFS OF HORSES
SAID JANE OH BOTHER NUTS SAID ROBERT BUT DINNER'S DIFFERENT
IT WAS HEARTLESS WORK NEXT SHE BROKE OPEN THE MISSIONARY BOX WITH THE POKER JANE TOLD HER THAT IT WAS WRONG OF COURSE BUT ANTHEA SHUT HER LIPS VERY TIGHT AND THEN SAID DON'T BE SILLY IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
FEW INTREPID SURVIVORS THAT'S US
NEVER MIND WHAT NAMES HE WAS CHRISTENED BY AND MARTHA RUSHED AT HIM AND CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING COME TO HIS OWN MARTHA THEN A PRECIOUS POPPET THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE NAMES SHALL NOW BE BURIED IN OBLIVION STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY
AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH IN THE MISSIONARY BOX
IT ISN'T ROBERT WAS BEGINNING STERNLY BUT ANTHEA INTERRUPTED OH YES YOU DO SHE SAID COAXINGLY IT'S A VERY NICE GAME REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY GET IN AND IF THEY DO
YES GIGGLED MARTHA YOU'D BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF ME WHILE YOU'VE GOT ME I SHALL GIVE YOUR MA NOTICE DIRECTLY MINUTE SHE COMES BACK OH MARTHA WE HAVEN'T BEEN SO VERY HORRID TO YOU HAVE WE ASKED ANTHEA AGHAST
SHE FETCHED A LITTLE BOX FROM HER CORNER DRAWER AND WENT TO FIND MARTHA WHO WAS LAYING THE CLOTH AND NOT IN THE BEST OF TEMPERS
THEY CAME OFF IN THE HANDS OF THE VICTORS WITHOUT STRUGGLE WITHOUT RESISTANCE THEY YIELDED THEIR SCALPS TO THE CONQUERING ROCK DWELLERS OH HOW LITTLE A THING IS A SCALP SO LIGHTLY WON
THE INDIANS HAD FORMED A RING ROUND THE CHILDREN AND NOW SAT ON THE GROUND GAZING AT THEIR CAPTIVES THERE WAS A THREATENING SILENCE THEN SLOWLY BY TWOS AND THREES THE INDIANS WHO HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR FIREWOOD CAME BACK AND THEY CAME BACK EMPTY HANDED
INTO THE MOAT WATER IN ANOTHER MOMENT ROBERT WAS OUTSIDE THE LITTLE ROOM
PERHAPS HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TEA THERE PERHAPS SUNSET WOULD COME UPON HIM AMID THE DAZZLING LUXURY OF CLUB LAND AND A HELPLESS CROSS SLEEPY BABY WOULD FIND ITSELF ALONE AMID UNSYMPATHETIC WAITERS AND WOULD WAIL MISERABLY FOR PANTY FROM THE DEPTHS OF A CLUB ARM CHAIR
DREW A DEEP BREATH AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID ROBERT I TOLD YOU SO AND I SAY WE DIDN'T SURRENDER DID WE
AND THE COOK SAID JANE YOU FORGET THEY CAN'T NOTICE ANYTHING SAID ROBERT THEY WOULDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY EVEN IF THEY WERE SCALPED OR ROASTED AT A SLOW FIRE BUT WOULD THEY COME RIGHT AT SUNSET OF COURSE
EACH CLOSED ITS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO SCREAM THEY WAITED FOR THE SHARP AGONY OF THE KNIFE IT DID NOT COME NEXT MOMENT THEY WERE RELEASED AND FELL IN A TREMBLING HEAP THEIR HEADS DID NOT HURT AT ALL
AND NOW SAID BLACK PANTHER OUR TRIBES IF WE JUST WHISTLE THEM UP WILL FAR OUTNUMBER YOUR PUNY FORCES SO RESISTANCE IS USELESS RETURN THEREFORE TO YOUR OWN LAND O BROTHER
THE FOUR CHILDREN EACH HELD BETWEEN TWO STRONG LITTLE INDIANS CAST DESPAIRING GLANCES ROUND THEM OH IF THEY COULD ONLY SEE THE PSAMMEAD DO YOU MEAN TO SCALP US FIRST AND THEN ROAST US ASKED ANTHEA DESPERATELY
AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
NO ONE EVER CAN AS A MATTER OF FACT IN THAT PART OF KENT THE CHILDREN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF BUT IT ENDED IN A MOAN OF TERROR FOR BRIGHT KNIVES WERE BEING BRANDISHED ALL ABOUT THEM NEXT MOMENT EACH CHILD WAS SEIZED BY AN INDIAN
WITH FOUR WILD WAR WHOOPS OR AS NEAR THEM AS ENGLISH CHILDREN COULD BE EXPECTED TO GO WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS PRACTICE THEY RUSHED THROUGH THE GATE AND STRUCK FOUR WARLIKE ATTITUDES IN FACE OF THE LINE OF RED INDIANS
BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
THE STORY WAS RUNNING IN HIS HEAD AT BREAKFAST AND AS HE TOOK HIS THIRD CUP OF TEA HE SAID DREAMILY I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND NOT BIG ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE ONES JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR US TO FIGHT
THE AWFUL THING TO DAY WAS HIS GROWING UP SO SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO TIME TO IMPROVE HIM AT ALL HE DOESN'T WANT ANY IMPROVING SAID ANTHEA AS THE VOICE OF THE LAMB CAME COOING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR JUST AS SHE HAD HEARD IT IN HER HEART THAT AFTERNOON
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GET IT TO DAY IN CASE MOTHER COMES HOME TO MORROW YOU KNOW SHE SAID SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BUT YOU'RE ALL GOING INTO TOWN YOURSELVES SAID MARTHA
HAD BEEN GOT OFF ANTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH HE'S SAFE SHE SAID AND TO JANE'S HORROR
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
BUT THE HEARTS OF ALL THE CHILDREN WERE BEATING FURIOUSLY AND THEIR BREATH CAME IN SHORTER AND SHORTER GASPS FOR THE LITTLE REAL RED INDIANS WERE CLOSING UP ROUND THEM COMING NEARER AND NEARER WITH ANGRY MURMURS
IT WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER THERE WAS A CREAKING ABOVE AND SOMETHING RATTLED AND SHOOK THE PAVEMENT THEY STOOD ON SEEMED TO TREMBLE THEN A CRASH TOLD THEM THAT THE DRAWBRIDGE HAD BEEN LOWERED TO ITS PLACE
I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE GROWN UP SOME DAY ANTHEA WAS SAYING DREAMILY LOOKING UP AT THE BLUE OF THE SKY THAT SHOWED BETWEEN THE LONG STRAIGHT CHESTNUT LEAVES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAMB
PUSSY FEROX WE CALL IT IN THIS LAND LEADER OF THE VAST PHITEEZI TRIBE AND THOU VALOROUS REDSKIN GOLDEN EAGLE INQUIRED SUDDENLY OF ROBERT WHO TAKEN UNAWARES COULD ONLY REPLY THAT HE WAS BOBS LEADER OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE
THE PSAMMEAD MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND IT HAD GIVEN THE INDIAN CHIEF HIS WISH MARTHA BROUGHT HOME A JUG WITH A PATTERN OF STORKS AND LONG GRASSES ON IT ALSO SHE BROUGHT BACK ALL ANTHEA'S MONEY
THE FOUR CHILDREN STARTED TO RUN THEIR FIRST RUSH KNOCKED DOWN SOME HALF DOZEN INDIANS OVER WHOSE BLANKETED BODIES THE CHILDREN LEAPED AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE SAND PIT THIS WAS NO TIME FOR THE SAFE EASY WAY BY WHICH CARTS GO DOWN
IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER
AND SMOKE PIPES OF PEACE IN YOUR WAMPUMS WITH YOUR SQUAWS AND YOUR MEDICINE MEN AND DRESS YOURSELVES IN THE GAYEST WIGWAMS AND EAT HAPPILY OF THE JUICY FRESH CAUGHT MOCCASINS YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG MURMURED CYRIL ANGRILY
WE'RE ALL RATHER PALE AND I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT CYRIL IS THE COLOUR OF PUTTY I'M NOT SAID CYRIL THE REAL INDIANS OUTSIDE SEEM TO BE BROWNISH SAID ROBERT HASTILY I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE REALLY RED
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HURT SOMEBODY ROBERT CAUGHT UP THE STONE IN A FURY I SHOULD
I SELDOM PLAY
RIGHT OVER THE EDGE OF THE SAND PIT THEY WENT AMONG THE YELLOW AND PALE PURPLE FLOWERS AND DRIED GRASSES PAST THE LITTLE SAND MARTINS LITTLE FRONT DOORS SKIPPING CLINGING BOUNDING STUMBLING SPRAWLING AND FINALLY ROLLING
JANE PLEADED I DON'T BELIEVE THE SUN'S GOING TO SET TO NIGHT AT ALL
IT WAS A GLOOMY PARTY THAT WENT HOME THROUGH THE SOFT EVENING DURING ANTHEA'S REMARKS ROBERT HAD AGAIN MADE PLAY WITH THE PIN AND THE BICYCLE TYRE AND THE LAMB WHOM THEY HAD TO CALL SAINT MAUR OR DEVEREUX OR HILARY
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
JANE DOUBTFULLY SUPPOSED SO NOW THE LAMB WHOM I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER TO CALL SAINT MAUR WAS EXAMINING THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND TALKING TO HER WITH A VERY GROWN UP MANNER INDEED NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED TO SEE AND HEAR HIM
A RELIC OF FOOLISH AND FAR OFF CHILDHOOD THIS WAS AWFUL HE WAS THEIR ELDER BROTHER NOW WAS HE WELL OF COURSE HE WAS IF HE WAS GROWN UP SINCE THEY WEREN'T THUS
THERE'S ONE OF THE TURKEYS IN THERE IT'S NOT VERY WELL I COULD CUT ITS FEATHERS WITHOUT IT MINDING MUCH IT'S VERY BAD DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT GET ME THE CUTTING OUT SCISSORS
JANE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL HOW A PERSON COULD BE SO BRAVE AND LIKE A GENERAL AND THEN SUDDENLY GIVE WAY AND GO FLAT LIKE AN AIR BALLOON WHEN YOU PRICK IT
AND THIS THOUGHT FILLED HIS MIND WHEN HE HAPPENED TO WAKE EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER THE MORNING AFTER ROBERT HAD WISHED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY AND HAD BEEN IT THE DAY THAT LAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DAYS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ENTIRELY BY GETTING THE GOVERNESS CART HOME FROM BENENHURST
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
AND TRY TO GET UP BETTER CHILDREN IN THE MORNING NOW THEN DON'T LET ME HAVE TO TELL YOU TWICE IF I FIND ANY OF YOU NOT IN BED IN TEN MINUTES
IT GREW THINNER AND LARGER LINES CAME IN THE FOREHEAD THE EYES GREW MORE DEEP SET AND DARKER IN COLOUR THE MOUTH GREW LONGER AND THINNER MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL A LITTLE DARK MOUSTACHE APPEARED ON THE LIP OF ONE WHO WAS STILL EXCEPT AS TO THE FACE
THEN THEY CAREFULLY PAINTED EACH OTHER'S FACES AND HANDS WITH IT TILL THEY WERE QUITE AS RED AS ANY RED INDIAN NEED BE IF NOT REDDER THEY KNEW AT ONCE THAT THEY MUST LOOK VERY TERRIBLE WHEN THEY MET ELIZA IN THE PASSAGE AND SHE SCREAMED ALOUD
LOOK HERE JANE SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB
BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
WITH A SINGLE GROWN UP THE DOOR WAS OPENED SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES SAID THE VOICE OF MARTHA
AND WHEN HE WAS GIVEN A BASKET OF STUFF TO DELIVER A NOMADIC INSTINCT AROSE IRRESISTIBLY IT BECAME HIS PACK AND HE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE HOW HEAVY IT WAS NOR WHERE HE TOOK IT SO LONG AS HE DID NOT TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION
SMASH UP I MEAN REAL SAFE STEADY CONTROLLED FLYING AGAINST THE WIND GOOD AND RIGHT YOU AIN'T SEEN THAT
AND FORTY HOURS I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT WATERFALL YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME HAVE YOU HAD YOUR RATIONS YESSIR VERY WELL COME
YOU CAN'T SAY I BIN TO BRIGHTON FATHER SAID TOM
THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A PLACE CALLED CLAPHAM OR BUN HILL DO THEY I HAF HEARD NODING SAID THE LINGUIST THAT WAS ALL BERT COULD GET FOR A TIME BUT THE EXCITEMENT OF ALL THE MEN ABOUT HIM WAS CONTAGIOUS
LONG BROAD COMFORTABLE LOOKING CARS THAT WERE BRIGHTLY LIT AFTER DUSK AS THEY FLEW BY AT NIGHT TRANSIENT FLARES OF LIGHT AND A RUMBLING SOUND OF PASSAGE THEY KEPT UP A PERPETUAL SUMMER LIGHTNING
IN A FEW YEARS THEY REALISED BETTER IN A LITTLE WHILE NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING OF CROSSING AN ABYSS ON A WIRE AND THE MONO RAIL WAS SUPERSEDING THE TRAM LINES RAILWAYS AND INDEED EVERY FORM OF TRACK FOR MECHANICAL LOCOMOTION
HE'S A GO AHEAD CHAP IS BERT SAID TOM HE KNOWS A THING OR TWO LET'S HOPE HE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH SAID JESSICA WHO HAD A FINE SENSE OF LIMITATIONS IT'S GO AHEAD TIMES SAID TOM NOO PETATERS AND ENGLISH AT THAT
FIVE
PECULIARLY CURVED WING CASES IF ONE MAY BORROW A FIGURE FROM THE FLYING BEETLES REMAINED EXPANDED STIFFLY
BY A HAPPY MINGLING OF REASONING AND INTUITION PECULIAR TO HER SEX SHE FOUND GOLD AT HER FIRST DESCENT AND EMERGED AFTER THREE HOURS SUBMERSION WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDREDWEIGHT OF ORE CONTAINING GOLD
WITH A BLACK SMEARED FACE BY DAY AND A MUSIC HALL SIDE IN THE EVENING WHO DREAMT OF A PATENT LEVER CHAIN AND IT SEEMED TO BERT THAT HE WAS THE PERFECT MODEL OF A GENTLEMAN OF SPIRIT
MOREOVER EVERY TRADESMAN IN THE PLACE AND INDEED NEARLY EVERY HOUSE HAD ITS OWN TELEPHONE THE MONO RAIL CABLE STANDARD BECAME A STRIKING FACT IN URBAN LANDSCAPE FOR THE MOST PART STOUT IRON ERECTIONS RATHER LIKE TAPERING TRESTLES
IF THEY COULD SEE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE RAIL INAUDIBLE BUT CONVINCING THE GREAT INVENTOR EXPOUNDED HIS DISCOVERY AND SENT HIS OBEDIENT LITTLE MODEL OF THE TRAINS OF THE FUTURE UP GRADIENTS ROUND CURVES AND ACROSS A SAGGING WIRE
JUST LET HER KNOW I'M THINKING OF HER VERY LIKELY SAID BERT YOU'LL SEE ER ALL RIGHT NO SAID KURT WITH DECISION I KNOW
BUT BEFORE HE HAD MADE HIS SECOND CIRCUIT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE TOWERS FAME WAS LIFTING HER TRUMPET SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH AS THE STARTLED TRAMPS WHO SLEEP
AS THOUGH I'D JUST FOUND IT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE FOUND IT OUT
AND THEN HAD COME THE RAILWAY
IN THE NATURE OF A BEE OR WASP PARTS OF THE APPARATUS WERE SPINNING VERY RAPIDLY AND GAVE ONE A HAZY EFFECT OF TRANSPARENT WINGS BUT PARTS INCLUDING TWO
INADEQUATELY REPORTED AND HIS NAME SPELT VARIOUSLY BETTERIDGE AND BETRIDGE UNTIL HIS FLIGHT INDEED HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO EXIST IN THE PUBLIC MIND
THERE APPEARED GREAT CLANGOROUS PETROL TROLLEYS DELIVERING COAL AND PARCELS IN THE PLACE OF VANISHING HORSE VANS MOTOR OMNIBUSES OUSTED THE HORSE OMNIBUSES EVEN THE KENTISH STRAWBERRIES GOING LONDONWARD IN THE NIGHT TOOK TO MACHINERY
EXPERIMENTS FELL AWAY AFTER TWO EXPECTANT YEARS OF THIS SORT OF SUCCESS THE PUBLIC AND THEN THE NEWSPAPERS TIRED OF THE EXPENSIVE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTIONS THE OPTIMISTIC REPORTS
AND DREW SECRET SOCIETY HE REPEATED WITH HIS PIPE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND THE MATCH FLARING IN RESPONSE TO HIS WORDS
AND ALL THE SPORTING ONES APPROVED OF IT AS BEING VERY GOOD INDEED EVERYBODY TALKED OF FLYING EVERYBODY REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BOUND TO COME
FOR BUN HILL BECAME NOT ONLY A SORT OF MINOR CENTRE OF POWER DISTRIBUTION THE HOME COUNTIES POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY SET UP TRANSFORMERS AND A GENERATING STATION CLOSE BESIDE THE OLD GAS WORKS BUT ALSO A JUNCTION ON THE SUBURBAN MONO RAIL SYSTEM
WE SHALL BE BACK IN IT ALL IN TWO DAYS TIME HE SAID AND IT'S A DEVIL OF A WAR TO GO BACK TO THAT'S THE NEWS THE WORLD'S GONE MAD OUR FLEET BEAT THE AMERICANS THE NIGHT WE GOT DISABLED THAT'S CLEAR
BIG MODEL OF A MEGATHERIUM IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE GROUNDS AND HIS GIANT INSECT CAME DRONING OUT INTO A NEGLIGENT AND INCREDULOUS WORLD
IT'S JUST AS THOUGH I HAD WOKE UP TO IT ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERY NIGHT SINCE WE WERE AT NEW YORK I'VE DREAMT OF IT AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO IT'S THE WAY OF LIFE PEOPLE ARE TORN AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THEY CARE FOR HOMES ARE SMASHED CREATURES FULL OF LIFE
IT ISN'T VERY LIKE BUT IT'S LIKE ENOUGH LIKE WHAT ANOTHER WATERFALL I KNEW HE ASKED A QUESTION ABRUPTLY GOT A GIRL SMALLWAYS FUNNY THING SAID BERT THOSE FLOWERS I SUPPOSE I WAS JES THINKING OF ER
WELL SAID BERT I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE OF THEM ANYHOW JEST TO HELP BELIEVING I'LL BELIEVE WHEN I SEE THAT I'LL PROMISE YOU
HE WAS SITTING ON THE FENCE AT THE END OF HIS GARDEN AND SURVEYING THE GREAT BUN HILL GAS WORKS WITH AN EYE THAT NEITHER PRAISED NOR BLAMED ABOVE THE CLUSTERING GASOMETERS THREE UNFAMILIAR SHAPES APPEARED THIN WALLOWING BLADDERS THAT FLAPPED AND ROLLED ABOUT AND GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AND ROUNDER AND ROUNDER
IT WENT OVERHEAD PERHAPS A THOUSAND FEET UP BERT HEARD THE ENGINE SAILED AWAY SOUTHWARD VANISHED OVER THE HILLS REAPPEARED A LITTLE BLUE OUTLINE FAR OFF IN THE EAST GOING NOW VERY FAST BEFORE A GENTLE SOUTH WEST GALE
AND SPENDING IT ON CHIPS COMIC CUTS ALLY SLOPER'S HALF HOLIDAY CIGARETTES AND ALL THE CONCOMITANTS OF A LIFE OF PLEASURE AND ENLIGHTENMENT ALL OF THIS WITHOUT HINDRANCE TO HIS LITERARY STUDIES WHICH CARRIED HIM UP TO THE SEVENTH STANDARD
OR FOR THE MATTER OF THAT AN UNACCREDITED NATIVE CAN'T GET WITHIN FOUR MILES OF LYDD NOWADAYS NOT TO MENTION OUR LITTLE CIRCUS AT ALDERSHOT AND THE EXPERIMENTAL CAMP IN GALWAY NO
IT WAS UNUSUALLY GRAVE THAT MORNING I WAS JUST THINKING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WATERFALL CLOSER HE SAID IT REMINDS ME WHAT DO YOU WANT
OF A MACHINE THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE SATISFACTORILY THAT THE OUTSTANDING DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF FLYING WERE FINALLY SOLVED FEW OF THE PAPERS PRINTED HIS LETTER STILL FEWER WERE THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN HIS CLAIM
AND NOBODY DIDN'T GO NOT UNLESS THEY WAS GENTRY
AND HOW THAT MAGNATE RULED THE COUNTRY SIDE WHEN IT WAS COUNTRY SIDE OF SHOOTING AND HUNTING AND OF CACHES ALONG THE HIGH ROAD OF HOW WHERE THE GAS WORKS IS WAS A CRICKET FIELD AND OF THE COMING OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE
THE JAPANESE AT PORT ARTHUR THE FRENCH AT CASABLANCA IS GOING ON EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN THEY ARE FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES NO PLACE IS SAFE NO PLACE IS AT PEACE
NO ONE WAS EXCITED EVEN WHEN A FRACAS ON THE STEPS OF A LEADING HOTEL IN PICCADILLY IN WHICH HE TRIED TO HORSE WHIP A PROMINENT GERMAN MUSICIAN UPON SOME PERSONAL ACCOUNT DELAYED HIS PROMISED ASCENT THE QUARREL WAS
THEY TALK AND THEY DO SAID THE SOLDIER THE THING'S COMING IT KEEPS ON COMING SAID BERT I SHALL BELIEVE WHEN I SEE IT THAT WON'T BE LONG SAID THE SOLDIER
AND AN IMPLACABLE MANNER HE HAD BEEN AN UNDISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF MOST OF THE EXISTING AERONAUTICAL ASSOCIATIONS THEN ONE DAY HE WROTE TO ALL THE LONDON PAPERS TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN ASCENT FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE
THE FRAMEWORK HAD AN AIR OF DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT GAS CYLINDER AFTER IT LIKE A BRISK LITTLE TERRIER TOWING A SHY GAS DISTENDED ELEPHANT INTO SOCIETY THE COMBINED MONSTER CERTAINLY TRAVELLED AND STEERED
AND THEN ONE BRIGHT DAY BERT MOTORING TOWARD CROYDON WAS ARRESTED BY THE INSURGENCE OF A HUGE BOLSTER SHAPED MONSTER FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE GROUNDS AND OBLIGED TO DISMOUNT AND WATCH IT
THERE FOLLOWED ACTUAL FLIGHT THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT AN AFFAIR THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM BUN HILL IT WAS SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED IN PRIVATE GROUNDS OR OTHER ENCLOSED PLACES
AND BERT TOUCHED THE FRINGE OF A NUMBER OF TRADES IN SUCCESSION DRAPER'S PORTER CHEMIST'S BOY DOCTOR'S PAGE JUNIOR ASSISTANT GAS FITTER
THEN HE RETIRED HE SAT BY THE FIRESIDE A SHRIVELLED VERY VERY OLD COACHMAN FULL CHARGED WITH REMINISCENCES AND READY FOR ANY CARELESS STRANGER HE COULD TELL YOU OF THE VANISHED ESTATE OF SIR PETER BONE LONG SINCE CUT UP FOR BUILDING
HE LEFT BERT ON HIS WALL GRAVE AND PENSIVE WITH HIS CAP ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND A CIGARETTE SMOULDERING IN THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH IF WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE SAID BERT ME AND GRUBB
GOT ON TO IT WITH THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF GRUBB AND
THAT HASN'T GOT AT LEAST ONE OR TWO FLYING MACHINES HIDDEN UP ITS SLEEVE AT THE PRESENT TIME NOT ONE REAL WORKABLE FLYING MACHINES AND THE SPYING
AND THE OTHERS GO ON AGAIN AS THOUGH SUCH THINGS WEREN'T POSSIBLE AS I WENT ON
BUT HIS GARDENING MADE HIM ATTENTIVE TO THE HEAVENS AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND THE CRYSTAL PALACE FROM WHICH ASCENTS WERE CONTINUALLY BEING MADE AND PRESENTLY THE DESCENT OF BALLAST UPON HIS POTATOES CONSPIRED TO BEAR IN UPON
IT WAS LIKE A BOLSTER WITH A BROKEN NOSE AND BELOW IT AND COMPARATIVELY SMALL WAS A STIFF FRAMEWORK BEARING A MAN AND AN ENGINE WITH A SCREW THAT WHIZZED ROUND IN FRONT AND A SORT OF CANVAS RUDDER BEHIND
THE COMING OF FLYING OCCURRED PEOPLE TALK GLIBLY ENOUGH OF EPOCH MAKING EVENTS THIS WAS AN EPOCH MAKING EVENT IT WAS THE UNANTICIPATED AND ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT
THERE WERE SCARCELY THIRTY PEOPLE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS CLAMOUR WHEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK ONE SUMMER MORNING THE DOORS OF THE BIG SHED IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER HIS APPARATUS OPENED IT WAS NEAR THE
ALL DE VORLT IS AT VOR BERT STARED SOUTHWARD INTO THE DAWN IT DID NOT SEEM SO ALL DE VORLT IS AT VOR THEY HAF BURN BERLIN THEY HAF BURN LONDON
OF MISTER ALFRED BUTTERIDGE FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE TO GLASGOW AND BACK IN A SMALL BUSINESSLIKE LOOKING MACHINE HEAVIER THAN AIR AN ENTIRELY MANAGEABLE AND CONTROLLABLE MACHINE THAT COULD FLY AS WELL AS A PIGEON
HIS UNWILLING MIND THE FACT THAT THE GODDESS OF CHANGE WAS TURNING HER DISTURBING ATTENTION TO THE SKY THE FIRST GREAT BOOM IN AERONAUTICS WAS BEGINNING GRUBB AND BERT HEARD OF IT IN A MUSIC HALL
THE PERPETUAL SEQUENCE OF TRIUMPH AND DISASTER AND SILENCE FLYING SLUMPED EVEN BALLOONING FELL AWAY TO SOME EXTENT
HE WOULD GO ROUND TO TOM AT TIMES AND LOOK AND TALK SO BRILLIANTLY THAT TOM AND JESSIE WHO BOTH HAD A NATURAL TENDENCY TO BE RESPECTFUL TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING LOOKED UP TO HIM IMMENSELY
WONDER THEY ALL GET BACK ORF TO BRIGHTON INDEED
THROWING GRAVEL AT PEOPLE IT AIN'T WHAT I BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER LADYLIKE WHETHER OR NO MISTER STRINGER NODDED HIS HEAD APPROVINGLY AND FOR A TIME THEY CONTINUED TO REGARD THE SWELLING BULKS WITH EXPRESSIONS THAT HAD CHANGED FROM INDIFFERENCE TO DISAPPROVAL
GAW HE SAID AND STOOPED TO PICK ONE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
AT FIRST THE MOST OBVIOUS ASPECT WAS THE MULTIPLICATION OF BALLOONS THE SKY OF BUN HILL BEGAN TO BE INFESTED BY BALLOONS ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS PARTICULARLY YOU COULD SCARCELY LOOK SKYWARD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITHOUT DISCOVERING A BALLOON SOMEWHERE
AND A WONDERFUL CAP A STINK MAKING GENTLEMAN A SWIFT HIGH CLASS BADGER WHO FLED PERPETUALLY ALONG HIGH ROADS FROM THE DUST AND STINK HE PERPETUALLY MADE AND HIS LADY AS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE HER AT BUN HILL
WHAT A MUDDLE AND CONFUSION LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BATTLES AND MASSACRES AND DISASTERS THE HATES AND HARSH ACTS THE MURDERS AND SWEATINGS THE LYNCHINGS AND CHEATINGS
PLATE GLASS SHOPS A SCHOOL BOARD RATES OMNIBUSES TRAMCARS GOING RIGHT AWAY INTO LONDON ITSELF BICYCLES MOTOR CARS AND THEN MORE MOTOR CARS A CARNEGIE LIBRARY
OF LADY BONE'S CHINTZES AND CRINOLINES NOBODY HEEDED HIM THE WORLD HAD THROWN UP A NEW TYPE OF GENTLEMAN ALTOGETHER A GENTLEMAN OF MOST UNGENTLEMANLY ENERGY A GENTLEMAN IN DUSTY OILSKINS AND MOTOR GOGGLES
IN THE UNPARALLELED QUANTITY OF SEVENTEEN OUNCES TO THE TON BUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HER SUBMARINE MINING INTENSELY INTERESTING AS IT IS MUST BE TOLD AT SOME OTHER TIME
ON THE SEATS OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE WERE ROUSED BY HIS BUZZ AND AWOKE TO DISCOVER HIM CIRCLING THE NELSON COLUMN AND BY THE TIME HE HAD GOT TO BIRMINGHAM WHICH PLACE HE CROSSED ABOUT HALF PAST TEN
AND THEN SPRINGING FROM NOWHERE SUSTAINED ONE KNEW NOT HOW CAME A PERSISTENT DISTURBING RUMOUR
AND CLATTERED INSTEAD OF CREAKING AND BECAME AFFECTED IN FLAVOUR BY PROGRESS AND PETROL AND THEN YOUNG BERT SMALLWAYS GOT A MOTOR BICYCLE TWO
UNFORTUNATELY HEAVEN HAD NOT PLANNED A PEACEFUL WORLD FOR HIM HE LIVED IN A WORLD OF OBSTINATE AND INCESSANT CHANGE AND IN PARTS WHERE ITS OPERATIONS WERE UNSPARINGLY CONSPICUOUS VICISSITUDE WAS IN THE VERY SOIL HE TILLED
RESUMED WORK BEFORE HALF PAST TWO THE PUBLIC MIND WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED
AND NOW EVERY LITTLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY HAS ITS WEEKLY OUTINGS UPPINGS RATHER IT'S BEEN THE SALVATION OF THEM GAS COMPANIES LARST SATIDAY I GOT THREE BARRER LOADS OF GRAVEL OFF MY PETATERS SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS
HE COULD RIDE BICYCLES FOR MILES THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO PIECES INSTANTLY UNDER YOU OR ME
SEE HIS TIE LAST NIGHT IT WASN'T SUITED TO HIM TOM IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S TIE HE WASN'T UP TO IT NOT THE REST OF HIM IT WASN'T BECOMING THEN PRESENTLY
WAS A WEATHER BITTEN GODDESS AS FREE FROM REFINEMENT AS A GIPSY
THE THING FLEW QUITE STEADILY AT A PACE OF ABOUT THREE MILES AN HOUR IN A WIDE CIRCLE MAKING A DEEP HUM
OR BY CINEMATOGRAPH RECORDS
THE ADVANCING WAVE SOON PRODUCED A SYMPATHETIC RIPPLE IN THE BUN HILL ESTABLISHMENT GRUBB ROUTED OUT HIS FLYING MACHINE MODEL AGAIN
TO ADD HIMSELF AS ONE MORE VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DANGER TO THE AMENITIES OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME THE NEWS DAMN THE NEWS SAID KURT YOU'LL GET NEWS ENOUGH BEFORE THE DAY'S OUT IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD THEY'RE SENDING THE GRAF ZEPPELIN FOR US SHE'LL BE HERE BY THE MORNING AND WE OUGHT TO BE AT NIAGARA OR ETERNAL SMASH WITHIN EIGHT
IT RAN ALONG ITS SINGLE RAIL ON ITS SINGLE WHEELS SIMPLE AND SUFFICIENT IT STOPPED REVERSED STOOD STILL BALANCING PERFECTLY
THOUGH IT REMAINED A FAIRLY POPULAR SPORT AND CONTINUED TO LIFT GRAVEL FROM THE WHARF OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND DROP IT UPON DESERVING PEOPLE'S LAWNS AND GARDENS THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN REASSURING YEARS FOR TOM AT LEAST SO FAR AS FLYING WAS CONCERNED
WHAT THEY DROPPED AS BALLASE
AND PRESENTLY HE SAW KURT STANDING ALONE HANDS BEHIND HIM AND LOOKING AT ONE OF THE DISTANT WATERFALLS VERY STEADFASTLY HE WENT UP AND SALUTED SOLDIER FASHION BEG PARDON LIEUTENANT HE SAID KURT TURNED HIS FACE
TO APPRECIATE MISTER BUTTERIDGE AT HIS PROPER VALUE HE CIRCLED THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND DROPPED TO WITHIN SHOUTING DISTANCE OF THE CROWDS IN WEST END PARK AND ON THE SLOPE OF GILMOREHILL
BUT AT LAST HIS SAVINGS ACCUMULATED AND HIS CHANCE CAME THE HIRE PURCHASE SYSTEM BRIDGED A FINANCIAL GAP AND ONE BRIGHT AND MEMORABLE SUNDAY MORNING HE WHEELED HIS NEW POSSESSION THROUGH THE SHOP INTO THE ROAD
AND THUNDERSTORM IN THE STREET BELOW PRESENTLY THE ENGLISH CHANNEL WAS BRIDGED A SERIES OF GREAT IRON EIFFEL TOWER PILLARS CARRYING MONO RAIL CABLES AT A HEIGHT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER
WHICH FOR SOME REASON UPSET TOM DREADFULLY AND MADE HIM GLOOMY FOR DAYS AFTER THE FIRST ONE PASSED THE SHOP ALL THIS GYROSCOPIC AND MONO RAIL DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY ABSORBED A VAST AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ATTENTION
HE HIRED OUT QUITE THE DIRTIEST AND UNSAFEST BICYCLES IN THE WHOLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND CONDUCTED THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH ASTONISHING VERVE BERT AND HE SETTLED DOWN VERY WELL TOGETHER BERT LIVED IN BECAME ALMOST A TRICK RIDER
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
OH DON'T STALL PLEASE CLARA AMORY INTERRUPTED BUT DO TALK ABOUT ME A LITTLE WON'T YOU SURELY I'D ADORE TO SHE DIDN'T SMILE THAT'S SWEET OF YOU
I'M READING THE FOUR GOSPELS NOW AND THE VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE WHAT CHIEFLY STARTED YOU WELLS I GUESS AND TOLSTOI AND A MAN NAMED EDWARD CARPENTER I'VE BEEN READING FOR OVER A YEAR NOW
HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO NOR HAVE I MUCH CURIOSITY TO MORROW I'M GOING TO LEAVE NEW YORK FOR GOOD IT'S A BAD TOWN UNLESS YOU'RE ON TOP OF IT QUESTION DO YOU WANT A LOT OF MONEY A
AMORY FINALLY PREVAILED AND ALEC AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS FACE VALUE IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS IF HE WAS ALLOWED REST PERIODS WHEN THEY WERE ALONE SO AMORY RAN IT OUT AT A GREAT RATE BRINGING THE MOST ECCENTRIC CHARACTERS TO DINNER
AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
SOMEHOW DID HAVE CHARMS YOU WEPT A BIT AND I GREW SAD FOR YOU RIGHT HERE WHERE MISTER X DEFENDS DIVORCE AND WHAT'S HER NAME FALLS FAINTING IN HIS ARMS STILL CALM
BROWSING IN HER LIBRARY AMORY FOUND A TATTERED GRAY BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A YELLOW SHEET
TAKE A STICK ANSWERED ALEC WITH PONDEROUS REVERENCE ONE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF A BROOM HANDLE
THEY'RE WARMING THEMSELVES AT HER VIRTUE BUT SARAH SEES THE SIMPER AND NEVER MAKES THAT REMARK AGAIN ONLY SHE FEELS A LITTLE COLDER AFTER THAT QUESTION ALL YOUR CALORIES GONE
THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU'RE WRONG I'M SURE I'M NOT AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPRISONMENT EXCEPT FOR THE INSANE ON THIS POINT AMORY COULD NOT AGREE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT LIFE AND HISTORY WERE RIFE WITH THE STRONG CRIMINAL KEEN BUT OFTEN SELF DELUDING
AIN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL ENTER A FLOOR WALKER SILENCE TILL HE MOVES FORWARD SMIRKING SOCIETY PERSON AIN'T SHE YEAH BUT POOR NOW I GUESS SO THEY SAY
SAYNE WHAT THE DEVIL NECK HURTS DARNED UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT NO DESIRE TO SLEEP WITH JILL WHAT COULD ALEC SEE IN HER
IF YOU ASK ME CRIED PHYLLIS QUICKLY OF COURSE I DO SAID BURNE FEEBLY
GRAY CONVENT WALL ON A GRAY DAY AND A GIRL WITH HER CLOAK BLOWN BY THE WIND SITTING ATOP OF IT AND THINKING ABOUT THE MANY COLORED WORLD AS A RULE SUCH SENTIMENT BORED HIM
NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
MAYBE SHE ANSWERED BUT I THINK NOT I'M NEVER REALLY WILD AND NEVER HAVE BEEN THAT LITTLE OUTBURST WAS PURE SPRING AND YOU ARE TOO SAID HE
SHE WAS VOCIFEROUSLY GREETED AND ESCORTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ACROSS THE CAMPUS FOLLOWED BY HALF A HUNDRED VILLAGE URCHINS TO THE STIFLED LAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF ALUMNI AND VISITORS HALF OF WHOM HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS A PRACTICAL JOKE
FIRST AND PARTLY BY ACCIDENT THEY STRUCK ON CERTAIN BOOKS A DEFINITE TYPE OF BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT AMORY CHRISTENED QUEST BOOKS IN THE QUEST BOOK
YOU LACK JUDGMENT THE JUDGMENT TO DECIDE AT ONCE WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR IMAGINATION WILL PLAY YOU FALSE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE WELL I'LL BE DARNED EXCLAIMED AMORY IN SURPRISE THAT'S THE LAST THING I EXPECTED
THROUGH EARLY MARCH HE TOOK TO GOING TO PHILADELPHIA FOR WEEK ENDS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE THERE AND SHE SEEMED NOT ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM ALONE
IT'S THE ONE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL I'VE NEVER MET A MAN WHO LED A ROTTEN LIFE AND DIDN'T HAVE A WEAK WILL HOW ABOUT GREAT CRIMINALS THEY'RE USUALLY INSANE IF NOT THEY'RE WEAK THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STRONG SANE CRIMINAL
FORGETTING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS FROM HIM AT ANY RATE CLARA TOLD AMORY MUCH ABOUT HERSELF THAT EVENING SHE HAD HAD A HARRIED LIFE FROM SIXTEEN ON AND HER EDUCATION HAD STOPPED SHARPLY WITH HER LEISURE
I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
A PETTY CONSUMMATION OF HIMSELF AND LIKE A SOMBRE BACKGROUND LAY THAT INCIDENT OF THE SPRING BEFORE THAT FILLED HALF HIS NIGHTS WITH A DREARY TERROR AND MADE HIM UNABLE TO PRAY
THE BLITHESOME PHYLLIS BORE HER TWENTY FIVE SUMMERS GAYLY FROM THE TRAIN BUT ON THE PLATFORM A GHASTLY SIGHT MET HER EYES
AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
THE YOUNGER PROFESSORS THE ILLITERATE ATHLETES LIKE LANGUEDUC THINK HE'S GETTING ECCENTRIC BUT THEY JUST SAY GOOD OLD BURNE HAS GOT SOME QUEER IDEAS IN HIS HEAD AND PASS ON THE PHARISEE CLASS GEE THEY RIDICULE HIM UNMERCIFULLY
THE HERO SET OFF IN LIFE ARMED WITH THE BEST WEAPONS AND AVOWEDLY INTENDING TO USE THEM AS SUCH WEAPONS ARE USUALLY USED TO PUSH THEIR POSSESSORS AHEAD AS SELFISHLY AND BLINDLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THE HEROES OF THE QUEST BOOKS DISCOVERED
SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE BEHIND BUT THEY STAYED CLOSE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHOM SHE WAS WITH TALKING IN LOUD VOICES OF THEIR FRIENDS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM UNTIL SHE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER ACQUAINTANCES WHISPERING
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
CLARA DIDN'T GLOAT SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT IMMEDIATELY BUT SHE HAD STARTED HIM THINKING AND HE BELIEVED SHE WAS PARTLY RIGHT HE FELT LIKE A FACTORY OWNER WHO AFTER ACCUSING A CLERK OF DISHONESTY
OWN TASTE THE BEST ISABELLE CLARA ROSALIND ELEANOR WERE ALL AMERICAN ELEANOR WOULD PITCH PROBABLY SOUTHPAW ROSALIND WAS OUTFIELD WONDERFUL HITTER CLARA FIRST BASE MAYBE
HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH WHILE BEING A DIPLOMATIC AUTOCRAT AROUND HIS CLUB ON PROSPECT AVENUE AND BASKING IN THE HIGH LIGHTS OF CLASS OFFICE IT WAS DISTINCTLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF ARISTOCRACY THAT BURNE FOUND HIS WAY AMORY THROUGH KERRY
HOW HE LOVED TO DO ANY SORT OF THING WITH CLARA SHOPPING WITH HER WAS A RARE EPICUREAN DREAM IN EVERY STORE WHERE SHE HAD EVER TRADED SHE WAS WHISPERED ABOUT AS THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS PAGE
NO SOMEBODY FLUNKED OUT OR ANOTHER SHIP SUNK WORSE THAN THAT
BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
SMILING A REPERTOIRE WHILE THE POOR PLAY REACHED ME AS A FAINT RIPPLE REACHES SHORE YAWNING AND WONDERING AN EVENING THROUGH I WATCH ALONE AND CHATTERINGS OF COURSE SPOIL THE ONE SCENE WHICH
HE SAW HER THAT WINTER IN PHILADELPHIA ENTERTAINING A HOUSEFUL OF MEN FOR AN EVENING WHEN HE KNEW SHE HAD NOT A SERVANT IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL GUARDING THE BABIES OVERHEAD HE SAW ONE OF THE GREATEST LIBERTINES IN THAT CITY
BURNE I DISAGREE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HOW ABOUT THE SUPERMAN WELL HE'S EVIL I THINK YET HE'S STRONG AND SANE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'LL BET THOUGH THAT HE'S STUPID OR INSANE I'VE MET HIM OVER AND OVER AND HE'S NEITHER
AND AROUND SMALL TABLES AT THE NASSAU INN
QUITE SUBMERGED IN HIS BROTHER'S PERSONALITY
OVER HER GRAY AND VELVET DRESS UNDER HER MOLTEN BEATEN HAIR COLOR OF ROSE IN MOCK DISTRESS FLUSHES AND FADES AND MAKES HER FAIR FILLS THE AIR FROM HER TO HIM
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE JUST A RATHER ORIGINAL POLITICIAN HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER THAT'S WHAT FRED SLOANE TOLD ME TO DAY I SUPPOSE I HAVE IT COMING ONE AFTERNOON THEY DIPPED INTO A SUBJECT THAT HAD INTERESTED AMORY FOR A LONG TIME
JUST PASSIVELY AFRAID QUESTION
BURNE SEEMED TO BE CLIMBING HEIGHTS WHERE OTHERS WOULD BE FOREVER UNABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD I TELL YOU AMORY DECLARED TO TOM HE'S THE FIRST CONTEMPORARY I'VE EVER MET
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO VIOLENTLY DISAPPROVE OF BURNE'S RADICALISM ARE DISTINCTLY THE PHARISEE CLASS I MEAN THEY'RE THE BEST EDUCATED MEN IN COLLEGE
DON'T ASK ME QUESTION DON'T YOU CARE
CAME UNDER THE LASH OF MANY TONGUES UNTIL A FRAILER MAN THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SNOWED UNDER DON'T YOU MIND LOSING PRESTIGE ASKED AMORY ONE NIGHT THEY HAD TAKEN TO EXCHANGING CALLS SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK OF COURSE I DON'T WHAT'S PRESTIGE AT BEST
THAT IT BROUGHT A PICTURE OF CLARA TO HIS MIND OF CLARA ON SUCH A COOL GRAY DAY WITH HER KEEN BLUE EYES STARING OUT TRYING TO SEE HER TRAGEDIES COME MARCHING OVER THE GARDENS OUTSIDE HE ENVIED THAT POEM
BUT CLARA TALKING CLARA TELLING A SLENDER TALE OF A HATPIN AND AN INEBRIATED MAN AND HERSELF
GEE GIRLS AIN'T SHE SOME KID AND CLARA BEAMED ON ALL ALIKE AMORY BELIEVED THAT TRADESPEOPLE GAVE HER DISCOUNTS SOMETIMES TO HER KNOWLEDGE AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT IT HE KNEW SHE DRESSED VERY WELL
THAT'S WHY A GOOD MAN GOING WRONG ATTRACTS PEOPLE THEY STAND AROUND AND LITERALLY WARM THEMSELVES AT THE CALORIES OF VIRTUE HE GIVES OFF SARAH MAKES AN UNSOPHISTICATED REMARK AND THE FACES SIMPER IN DELIGHT HOW INNOCENT THE POOR CHILD IS
AND THE POINT OF ABOLISHING THE CLUBS WAS BROUGHT UP BY SOME ONE EVERYBODY THERE LEAPED AT IT IT HAD BEEN IN EACH ONE'S MIND MORE OR LESS AND IT JUST NEEDED A SPARK TO BRING IT OUT FINE I SWEAR I THINK IT'LL BE MOST ENTERTAINING
THEY HAD HASHED AND REHASHED FOR MANY A FRUGAL CONVERSATIONAL MEAL THAT NIGHT THEY DISCUSSED THE CLUBS UNTIL TWELVE AND IN THE MAIN THEY AGREED WITH BURNE
NEVER ENTERS THE PHILADELPHIAN SOCIETY HE HAS NO FAITH IN THAT ROT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS AND A KIND WORD IN TIME WILL RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE WORLD MOREOVER HE TAKES A DRINK WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT HE CERTAINLY IS GETTING IN WRONG

TWO AND THREE LOOK ALIKE NO NOT MUCH SEAT DAMP ARE CLOTHES ABSORBING WETNESS FROM SEAT OR SEAT ABSORBING DRYNESS FROM CLOTHES SITTING ON WET SUBSTANCE GAVE APPENDICITIS SO FROGGY PARKER'S MOTHER SAID WELL HE'D HAD IT
THEY WALKED ALONG AND HE REALIZED SLOWLY HOW MUCH SHE HAD TOLD HIM NEVER IN LOVE SHE SEEMED SUDDENLY A DAUGHTER OF LIGHT ALONE
AND GIGANTIC PADDED SHOULDERS ON THEIR HEADS WERE RAKISH COLLEGE HATS PINNED UP IN FRONT AND SPORTING BRIGHT ORANGE AND BLACK BANDS WHILE FROM THEIR CELLULOID COLLARS BLOSSOMED FLAMING ORANGE TIES THEY WORE BLACK ARM BANDS WITH ORANGE P'S AND CARRIED CANES FLYING PRINCETON PENNANTS
WHICH ONLY GOES TO PROVE THE RARE ENERGY OF SOPHOMORE HUMOR UNDER EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP THEN AGAIN THAT VERY FALL BURNE HAD CAUSED A SENSATION A CERTAIN PHYLLIS STYLES AN INTERCOLLEGIATE PROM TROTTER HAD FAILED TO GET HER YEARLY INVITATION TO THE HARVARD PRINCETON GAME
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM THEY COULD MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE NOTHING WHATEVER THEY GAVE HER A SORT OF INNOCENT ATTENTION AND THE BEST SMILES MANY OF THEM HAD SMILED FOR LONG THERE WERE FEW TEARS IN CLARA BUT PEOPLE SMILED MISTY EYED AT HER
NO I AM MERELY AFRAID OF BEING POOR QUESTION VERY AFRAID
REALLY THEY ARE THE ONLY THINGS I CAN DO QUESTION BE DEFINITE
BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
THE NEXT MORNING HE MET BURNE HURRYING ALONG MC COSH WALK AFTER A RECITATION WHITHER BOUND TSAR OVER TO THE PRINCE OFFICE TO SEE FERRENBY
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
BUT SOMEHOW ARE NEVER ACCUSED OF THE DEARTH AND THE LARGE MOUTH AND BROAD CHIN AND RATHER BIG NOSE UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE THE SUPERIOR FACE I'M NOT SO SURE AMORY WAS ALL FOR CLASSICAL FEATURES OH YES I'LL SHOW YOU AND BURNE PULLED OUT OF HIS DESK
BECOMING REALLY INSINCERE CALLING MYSELF NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW THINKING I REGRETTED MY LOST YOUTH WHEN I ONLY ENVY THE DELIGHTS OF LOSING IT

ON A FEW LINES ON WHAT I CONSIDER THE ESSENTIAL LINES POETRY WELL FRANKLY NOT WHAT YOU CALL POETRY OR FOR YOUR REASONS YOU TWO WRITE OF COURSE AND LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHITMAN IS THE MAN THAT ATTRACTS ME WHITMAN
HIS ENTITY DROPPED OUT OF HER PLANE AND HE LONGED ONLY TO TOUCH HER DRESS WITH ALMOST THE REALIZATION THAT JOSEPH MUST HAVE HAD OF MARY'S ETERNAL SIGNIFICANCE BUT QUITE MECHANICALLY HE HEARD HIMSELF SAYING
AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
AMORY SIGHED AND DECIDED TO GO AS A FAVOR CLARA SHE WAS IMMEMORIAL
AND YET NOT BE IRRITATING TO DISTRACTION SHE DID IT CONSTANTLY WITH SUCH A SERIOUS ENTHUSIASM THAT HE GREW FOND OF WATCHING HER GOLDEN HAIR BENT OVER A BOOK BROW WRINKLED EVER SO LITTLE AT HUNTING HER SENTENCE
THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
BUT I MEAN THE MASS OF HIS WORK HE'S TREMENDOUS LIKE TOLSTOI THEY BOTH LOOK THINGS IN THE FACE AND SOMEHOW DIFFERENT AS THEY ARE STAND FOR SOMEWHAT THE SAME THINGS YOU HAVE ME STUMPED BURNE AMORY ADMITTED I'VE READ ANNA KARENINA
BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
BURNE HOLIDAY WAS SO EVIDENTLY DEVELOPING
THERE WAS AN IDLE DAY OF OURS WHEN HAPPY ENDINGS DIDN'T BORE OUR UNFERMENTED SOULS I COULD ADORE YOUR EAGER FACE BESIDE ME WIDE EYED GAY
HOW ABOUT RELIGION AMORY ASKED HIM DON'T KNOW I'M IN A MUDDLE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I'VE JUST DISCOVERED THAT I'VE A MIND AND I'M STARTING TO READ READ WHAT EVERYTHING I HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE OF COURSE BUT MOSTLY THINGS TO MAKE ME THINK
VERY OCCASIONALLY AMORY STAYED FOR LITTLE HALF HOURS AFTER THE REST OF THE COURT HAD GONE AND THEY WOULD HAVE BREAD AND JAM AND TEA LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OR MAPLE SUGAR LUNCHES AS SHE CALLED THEM AT NIGHT
DOVETAILED SO COMPLETELY WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY QUESTIONED RATHER THAN ARGUED AND ENVIED THE SANITY THAT ENABLED THIS MAN TO STAND OUT SO AGAINST ALL TRADITIONS THEN AMORY BRANCHED OFF AND FOUND THAT BURNE WAS DEEP IN OTHER THINGS AS WELL
ABOUT A HUNDRED JUNIORS AND SENIORS RESIGNED FROM THEIR CLUBS IN A FINAL FURY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE CLUBS IN HELPLESSNESS TURNED UPON BURNE THEIR FINEST WEAPON RIDICULE EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HIM LIKED HIM BUT WHAT HE STOOD FOR AND HE BEGAN TO STAND FOR MORE ALL THE TIME

A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT

THAT I HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS TO MY NAME QUESTION
BUT THIS FAD OF POPULAR PREACHERS RISING ON THEIR TOES IN SIMULATED VIRILITY
A MAN WHO WAS HABITUALLY DRUNK AND NOTORIOUS AT HOME AND ABROAD SITTING OPPOSITE HER FOR AN EVENING DISCUSSING GIRLS BOARDING SCHOOLS WITH A SORT OF INNOCENT EXCITEMENT
FOR IN HIS DREAM SHE HAD BEEN A SILLY FLAXEN CLARA
THE BATTERY IS READY FOR USE AND UPON ITS CIRCUIT BEING CLOSED THROUGH A TRANSLATING DEVICE SUCH AS A LAMP OR MOTOR A REVERSION DISCHARGE TAKES PLACE THE POSITIVE PLATE GIVING UP ITS OXYGEN AND THE NEGATIVE PLATE BEING OXIDIZED
TO FOLLOW HIS NATURAL BENT IN BEING SURROUNDED DAY AND NIGHT BY HIS RESPONSIBLE CHOSEN ASSOCIATES WITH WHOM HE WORKED UNINTERRUPTED BY OUTSIDERS FROM EARLY MORNING AWAY INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING THOSE WHO WERE LABORING WITH HIM INSPIRED BY HIS UNFLAGGING ENTHUSIASM

AND I WENT AND HAD QUITE A CHAT WITH HIM I SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF PERSONS BEING INOCULATED AND ALSO THE WHOLE MODUS OPERANDI WHICH WAS VERY INTERESTING
ON BLACK FRIDAY THEY PURCHASED ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY AND STILL THE PRICE WENT UP THE FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE IN PANIC BUT THE POOL PERSEVERED IN ITS EFFORT TO CORNER GOLD
NOT ONLY DUPLEX OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AS ABOVE EXPLAINED BUT COULD ALSO BE SENT DIPLEX THAT IS TO SAY IN ONE DIRECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT MESSAGES OVER THE ONE LINE
SO I WENT THERE AND SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS TELLING HIM STORIES
ALL THIS SOUNDS LIKE LACK OF APPRECIATION BUT IT IS ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT WHILE IN PARIS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE HE WORE THE DECORATION OF THE LEGION OF HONOR WHENEVER OCCASION REQUIRED
THE RELAY COILS ARE CONNECTED BY WIRE TO THE SPRING PIECE S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER IS CONNECTED TO EARTH IF THE KEY IS DEPRESSED THE ARMATURE IS ATTRACTED AND ITS BENT END IS MOVED UPWARD
I HAD USED AMMONIA AND BROMINE I DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME BUT I HAD MADE BROMIDE OF NITROGEN I PUT THE LARGE BULK OF IT IN THREE FILTERS AND AFTER IT HAD BEEN WASHED AND ALL THE WATER HAD COME THROUGH THE FILTER
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED THE PAID CHECKS FROM THE BANK AND I AM FEARFUL THAT MY ASSISTANT WHO HAS FORGED MY NAME TO SOME OF THE CHECKS HAS ABSCONDED WITH ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MISTER EDISON AND TOLD HIM OF THE FORGERY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TAKEN AND IN WHAT AN EMBARRASSING POSITION WE WERE FOR THE NEXT PAY ROLL
NAMELY THAT KNOWN AS THE LEAD SULPHURIC ACID CELL CONSISTING OF LEAD PLATES IMMERSED IN AN ELECTROLYTE OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID IN THE YEAR LAST NAMED EDISON FIRST BROUGHT OUT HIS NEW FORM OF NICKEL IRON CELL WITH ALKALINE ELECTROLYTE
THIS EARLY SHOP AFFORDS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH EDISON HAS MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON THE PERSONNEL OF THE ELECTRICAL ARTS AT A SINGLE BENCH THERE WORKED THREE MEN SINCE RICH OR PROMINENT
THIS EXHIBITED MERELY THE PREVAILING PRICE OF GOLD BUT AS ITS QUOTATIONS CHANGED FROM INSTANT TO INSTANT IT WAS IN A MOST LITERAL SENSE THE CYNOSURE OF NEIGHBORING EYES ONE INDICATOR LOOKED UPON THE GOLD ROOM
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND STRIKING INVESTIGATIONS MADE BY EDISON IN THIS CONNECTION IS WORTHY OF NOTE AND MAY BE RELATED IN HIS OWN WORDS I FELT CERTAIN THAT THERE MUST BE LARGE BODIES OF MAGNETITE IN THE EAST
BUT IT DID NO GOOD IN THIS CASE WHEN THE FIRST LAMP WORKS WERE STARTED AT MENLO PARK ONE OF MY EXPERIMENTS SEEMED TO SHOW THAT HOT MERCURY GAVE A BETTER VACUUM IN THE LAMP THAN COLD MERCURY I THEREUPON STARTED TO HEAT IT
MISTER EDISON STATING MOST POSITIVELY THAT NO COMPANY WITH WHICH HE HAD PERSONALLY BEEN ACTIVELY CONNECTED HAD EVER FAILED TO PAY ITS DEBTS AND HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HAVE THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY ANY EXCEPTION
SITTING BULL AND FIFTEEN SIOUX INDIANS CAME TO WASHINGTON TO SEE THE GREAT FATHER AND THEN TO NEW YORK AND WENT TO THE GOERCK STREET WORKS WE COULD MAKE SOME VERY GOOD PYROTECHNICS THERE SO WE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE INDIANS A SCARE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
WAS THE OTHER BRANCH ALL WERE CONNECTED WITH WIRES GOULD SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE FISK BEING THE EXECUTIVE DOWN TOWN FISK WORE A VELVET CORDUROY COAT AND A VERY PECULIAR VEST HE WAS VERY CHIPPER AND SEEMED TO BE LIGHT HEARTED AND HAPPY
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF MANY INACCURATE STORIES BUT IS DRAMATIC ENOUGH AS TOLD IN MISTER EDISON'S OWN VERSION ON THE THIRD DAY OF MY ARRIVAL AND WHILE SITTING IN THE OFFICE
AND AFTERWARD USED AS A MODEL BY MANY OTHERS THE SECOND ITEM WAS THE INGENIOUS AND VARIED FORMS OF CONVEYOR BELT DEVISED AND USED BY EDISON AT THE CONCENTRATING WORKS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED INTO A SEPARATE AND EXTENSIVE BUSINESS BY AN ENGINEER TO WHOM HE GAVE PERMISSION TO USE HIS PLANS AND PATTERNS
THE GIGANTIC EXPANSION OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY WAS FORESHADOWED IN THE CHANGE FROM WOOD TO COAL IN THE SMELTING FURNACES THE SEWING MACHINE HAD BROUGHT WITH IT LIKE THE FRICTION MATCH ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND INFLUENCES IN MODIFYING DOMESTIC LIFE
I CONTINUED AT HIS REQUEST TO PUT THE BALLS BACK IN THE SAME POSITION FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES
AND MANY WERE THE OCCASIONS WHEN I WAS NEARLY FROZEN IN THE ELIZABETH WALK THIS DOCTOR BRADLEY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PRECISION WITH THE GALVANOMETER
THE TEMPERATURE WOULD REACH SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED DEGREES FAHR TO CARRY OUT THIS LAW TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE IN REGARD TO PLATINA ET CETERA THEN WITH A GIVEN LENGTH OF WIRE TO QUADRUPLE THE HEAT WE MUST LESSEN THE RADIATING SURFACE TO ONE QUARTER AND TO DO THIS IN A SPIRAL
AND WAS DIVIDED AND MARKED IN EIGHTHS IT GEARED INTO A UNIT DRUM
CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO ELEMENTS OF DIFFERENT NATURE IMMERSED IN A MORE OR LESS LIQUID ELECTROLYTE OF CHEMICAL CHARACTER ON CLOSING THE CIRCUIT OF A PRIMARY BATTERY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IS GENERATED
WHEN I STARTED AT MENLO I HAD AN ELECTRIC FURNACE FOR WELDING RARE METALS THAT I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT VERY CLEARLY I WAS IN THE DARK ROOM WHERE I HAD A LOT OF CHLORIDE OF SULPHUR A VERY CORROSIVE LIQUID
INTO SUCH TIMES THOMAS ALVA EDISON WAS BORN AND HIS RELATIONS TO THEM AND TO THE EVENTS OF THE PAST SIXTY YEARS ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS NARRATIVE ASIDE FROM THE PERSONAL INTEREST THAT ATTACHES TO THE PICTURESQUE CAREER SO TYPICALLY AMERICAN
HE CONSUMED HIS SHARE OF THE LUNCH WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE PLEASURE
IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER THAT BETWEEN THE OUTLINE AND THE FILLING IN OF THE DETAILS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HARD WORK STUDY PATIENT PLODDING AND ENDLESS EXPERIMENTS BEFORE EDISON FINALLY PERFECTED HIS QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM
SHED ITS BRIGHT BEAMS UPON A DAZZLED WORLD THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY ELECTROLYTIC ACTION WAS RECOGNIZED AND MADE THE BASIS OF COMMUNICATING AT A DISTANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET
COVERED SEVERAL THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IN THE VAST MACHINERY HALL AND WAS CENTRED AROUND A HUGE EDISON LAMP BUILT OF MYRIADS OF SMALLER LAMPS OF THE ORDINARY SIZE
HIS OFFICE WAS FILLED WITH STACKS OF BOOKS ALL RELATING TO METAPHYSICS AND KINDRED MATTERS HE ASKED ME A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS AND HIS SYSTEM AND I SHOWED HIM HOW HE COULD SIMPLIFY THINGS GENERALLY
AND WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO RECEIVE AND CONSUME THE ORES WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONTRACTED FOR SO WHAT SALES WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE WERE AT EXTREMELY LOW PRICES
AT LAST EDISON WAS OVERPERSUADED AND ALL DIRTY AND PERSPIRING AS HE WAS RECEIVED THE MEDAL RATHER THAN CAUSE THE VISITOR TO COME AGAIN ON ONE OCCASION RECEIVING A MEDAL IN NEW YORK EDISON FORGOT IT ON THE FERRY BOAT AND LEFT IT BEHIND HIM
THE ARROWS INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF FLOW ALL MAGNETS HAVE TWO POLES NORTH AND SOUTH A PERMANENT MAGNET MADE OF STEEL WHICH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM SOFT IRON RETAINS ITS MAGNETISM FOR LONG PERIODS
TWO NO JAR BREAKAGE THREE POSSIBILITY OF QUICK DISCONNECTION OR REPLACEMENT OF ANY CELL WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED LABOR FOUR IMPOSSIBILITY OF BUCKLING
THE LATTER IN EACH CASE HAS IN ITS CIRCUIT A RESISTANCE R TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE MAIN LINE SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO INEQUALITIES IN THE CIRCUITS THE ARTIFICIAL LINE AS WELL AS THAT TO WHICH THE TWO COILS ARE JOINED
EVERYTHING WAS CRUDE AND PRIMITIVE THE POLES WERE TWO HUNDRED FEET APART AND COULD BARELY HOLD UP A WASH LINE
BY AN OPERATOR AT THE HOME STATION AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE TRANSMITTER ABOVE REFERRED TO BY A COMBINATION OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY AND THE POLAR RELAY TWO OPERATORS BY MANIPULATING TWO TELEGRAPH KEYS
CURRENT FLOWS VIA POST P THROUGH S AND TO BOTH RELAY COILS AT A THENCE OVER THE MAIN LINE TO MAIN LINE COIL AT B
ARE SO THOROUGHLY EXEMPLIFIED AND RENDERED PRACTICABLE BY THE APPARATUS AND METHODS DISCLOSED IN THE PATENTS ABOVE CITED THAT THESE BASIC INVENTIONS IN THEMSELVES PRACTICALLY CONSTITUTE THE ART ITS DEVELOPMENT PROCEEDING MAINLY ALONG THE LINE OF MANUFACTURING DETAILS
TO WHOM THE NOISE WAS THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE MECHANISM MISTER CALLAHAN REMOVED THE TWO DIALS AND SUBSTITUTING TYPE WHEELS TURNED THE MOVEMENTS FACE TO FACE SO THAT EACH TYPE WHEEL COULD IMPRINT ITS CHARACTERS UPON A PAPER TAPE IN TWO LINES
THIS WAS ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF HIS CONVERSATION FOR TWO DAYS
BUT THE PARIS NEWSPAPERS CAME AROUND AND WANTED PAY FOR NOTICES OF IT WHICH WE PROMPTLY REFUSED
WE SHALL OFFER A FEW BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THESE DECISIONS
OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TOOK THEIR MIDNIGHT LUNCH THERE WHEN I WENT WITH BORST AND
IT WILL HAVE BEEN GATHERED THAT EDISON HAS OWED HIS SPECIAL IMMUNITY FROM OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES NOT ONLY TO LUCK BUT TO UNUSUAL POWERS OF ENDURANCE AND A STRONG PHYSIQUE INHERITED NO DOUBT FROM HIS FATHER
BY SOME OF THE REAMED EXPERTS WHO ARE NOW WITNESSES TO BELITTLE HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND SHOW THAT IT DID NOT RISE TO THE DIGNITY OF AN INVENTION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INVENTION OF THE SLENDER THREAD OF CARBON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BURNERS PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED
IT SEEMS THERE IS A LITTLE HOLE ON THE STAGE WITH A HOOD OVER IT IN WHICH THE PROMPTER SITS WHEN OPERA IS GIVEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS NOT OCCUPIED AND I WAS GIVEN THE POSITION IN THE PROMPTER'S SEAT AND SAW THE WHOLE BALLET AT CLOSE RANGE
IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO OFFER HERE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE VARIED AND NUMEROUS OPERATIONS OF THE QUADRUPLEX THIS ARTICLE WOULD ASSUME THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREATISE
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE A POSITIVE PLATE HAS BEEN GIVEN THE THEORETICALLY BEST DESIGN TO PREVENT EXPANSION AND OVERCOME TROUBLE FROM THAT CAUSE ACTUAL TESTS LONG CONTINUED UNDER VERY SEVERE CONDITIONS
AND MOSTLY FILLED WITH BOARDS WITH A VENEER OF BRASS CHIPS
EPSTEIN WENT UP TO SEVERAL BOXES PILED FULL OF CHIPS AND SO HEAVY THAT HE COULD NOT LIFT EVEN ONE END OF A BOX NOW MISTER BERGMANN SAID EPSTEIN HOW MUCH FOR THE LOT
THE NEXT MAN ADJACENT WAS JOHN KRUESI AFTERWARD ENGINEER OF THE GREAT GENERAL ELECTRIC WORKS AT SCHENECTADY A THIRD WAS SCHUCKERT
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD SECURE A POSITION DURING THE DAY HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING THIS OPERATOR BUT FOUND THAT HE ALSO WAS OUT OF A JOB
MISTER EDISON LED THE WAY TO SMITH AND MC NELL'S OPPOSITE WASHINGTON MARKET AND WELL KNOWN TO OLD NEW YORKERS WE WENT INSIDE AND AS SOON AS THE WAITER APPEARED MISTER EDISON ORDERED APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A CUP OF COFFEE FOR HIMSELF
EACH ROLL HAD ALSO TWO ROWS OF FOUR INCH KNOBS INTENDED TO STRIKE A SERIES OF HAMMER LIKE BLOWS THE ROLLS WERE SET FACE TO FACE FOURTEEN INCHES APART IN A HEAVY FRAME AND THE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TONS OF WHICH SEVENTY TONS WERE IN MOVING PARTS
HE WAS CONVINCED FROM THE FIRST THAT THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM LAY IN A LAMP WHICH SHOULD HAVE AS ITS ILLUMINATING BODY A STRIP OF MATERIAL WHICH WOULD OFFER SUCH A RESISTANCE TO THE FLOW OF ELECTRIC CURRENT
AND MUCH TROUBLE TO THE BROKER HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAID NOW YOUNG MAN I WANT TO CLOSE UP THE MATTER OF YOUR INVENTIONS HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD RECEIVE
CALLAHAN MADE THE FURTHER INNOVATION OF INSULATING HIS CIRCUIT WIRES
PENNSYLVANIA BRIEF AS IT HAS BEEN SHOWS THAT A STRONGER AND TOUGHER METAL IS MADE EDISON HIMSELF TELLS AN INTERESTING LITTLE STORY IN THIS CONNECTION WHEN HE ENJOYED THE ACTIVE HELP OF THAT NOBLE CHARACTER JOHN FRITZ THE DISTINGUISHED INVENTOR AND PIONEER OF THE MODERN STEEL INDUSTRY IN AMERICA HE SAYS
THEN BACK ACROSS THE LINE OF MARCH AGAIN TWENTY FIVE MILES THEN SOUTH ANOTHER THOUSAND FEET ACROSS AGAIN AND SO ON THUS WE ADVANCED ALL THE WAY TO NORTH CAROLINA VARYING OUR CROSS COUNTRY MARCH FROM TWO TO TWENTY FIVE MILES ACCORDING TO GEOLOGICAL FORMATION
CONTROLLED AT CENTRAL BY TWO CIRCUIT CLOSING KEYS AND WAS A PROTOTYPE OF ALL THE LATER AND MODERN STEP BY STEP PRINTING TELEGRAPHS UPON WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL NEWS DEPENDS THE FRACTION DRUM
AND WAS ACTUALLY LIGHTING THEM UP TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
OR A NORTH POLE IF FLOWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ILLUSTRATED AT THE RIGHT OF THE FIGURE
AND CONSOLIDATED IN THE EDISON GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WITH A CAPITAL OF NO LESS THAN TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN EIGHT PER CENT DIVIDEND BASIS
BEARING ALWAYS IN MIND THAT BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WINDING OF THE POLAR AND NEUTRAL RELAYS NEITHER OF THE RELAYS AT ONE STATION WILL RESPOND TO THE HOME BATTERY AND CAN ONLY RESPOND TO THE DISTANT BATTERY
UNAWARE THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A PRACTICAL JOKE EDISON PROCEEDED GRAVELY TO STOW AWAY THE MONEY IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKETS AND ALL HIS OTHER POCKETS HE THEN WENT TO NEWARK AND SAT UP ALL NIGHT WITH THE MONEY FOR FEAR IT MIGHT BE STOLEN ONCE MORE HE SOUGHT HELP NEXT MORNING
I MADE A PERSONAL EXHIBIT COVERING ABOUT AN ACRE AS I HAD NO INTENTION OF OFFERING TO SELL ANYTHING I WAS SHOWING AND WAS PUSHING NO COMPANIES THE WHOLE EXHIBITION WAS MADE FOR HONOR AND WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF PROFIT
THE HOBBY HE HAD AT THE TIME I WAS THERE SAYS EDISON WAS THE AGING OF RAW WHISKEY BY PASSING STRONG ELECTRIC CURRENTS THROUGH IT HE HAD ARRANGED TWENTY JARS WITH PLATINUM ELECTRODES HELD IN PLACE BY HARD RUBBER
THE CEREMONY OF IDENTIFICATION PERFORMED WITH THE PAYING TELLER WHO WAS QUITE MERRY OVER THE INCIDENT EDISON WAS GIVEN THE AMOUNT IN BUNDLES OF SMALL BILLS UNTIL THERE CERTAINLY SEEMED
HE STARTED IN WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM AND AMBITION AND IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS WE SUCCEEDED IN PAYING OFF ALL THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE CONCENTRATING WORKS WHICH AMOUNTED TO SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND HE WAS NO SMALL MAN INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED HERE THAT DURING THE SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE VARIOUS MANUFACTURING EDISON LIGHTING INTERESTS IN AMERICA WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER
IF THE MAKE AND BREAK OF THE MAGNETIZING CURRENT BE RAPID THE VIBRATIONS BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE HUMAN EAR THE DIAPHRAGM WILL PRODUCE AN AUDIBLE SOUND
WHEN JAMES BROWN OF BROWN BROTHERS AND COMPANY BROKE THE CORNER BY SELLING FIVE MILLION GOLD ALL PAYMENTS WERE REPUDIATED BY SMITH GOULD AND MARTIN BUT THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE CHECKS AT BELDEN AND COMPANY'S FOR SOME TIME
REPRESENTED MUCH MORE THAN THAT SUM AND MADE A SPLENDID OUTLET FOR THE PRODUCT OF THE FACTORIES A FEW YEARS LATER CAME THE CONSOLIDATION WITH THE THOMSON HOUSTON INTERESTS IN THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY WHICH UNDER THE BRILLIANT AND VIGOROUS MANAGEMENT OF PRESIDENT C A COFFIN
NEWS IS VITAL TO WALL STREET AND THERE IS NO LIVING MAN
NO DIMINUTION OF DAILY WORK OR INCREASE OF DAILY COMFORT COULD BE SECURED WITH IT BUT THE LITTLE BATTERY WITH ITS METAL PLATES IN A WEAK SOLUTION PROVED A PERENNIAL RESERVOIR OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY SAFE AND CONTROLLABLE
IN LIKE MANNER IF THE TRANSMITTER AT B BE CLOSED CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH SIMILAR PARTS AND THUS CAUSE THE RELAY AT A TO RESPOND IF BOTH TRANSMITTERS BE CLOSED SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH BATTERIES WILL BE PLACED TO THE LINE
HEATED FROM BELOW BY GREAT OPEN FURNACE FIRES ALL DOWN THE INSIDE WALLS OF THIS TOWER WERE PLACED CAST IRON PLATES NINE FEET LONG AND SEVEN INCHES WIDE ARRANGED ALTERNATELY IN FISH LADDER FASHION
ISSUED MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
AND THROUGH THE GENERALLY TWO COILS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET THUS MAGNETIZING THE IRON CORE ITS ATTRACTIVE POWER DRAWS THE ARMATURE TOWARD THE POLES WHEN THE OPERATOR RELEASES THE PRESSURE ON HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
WHOSE BUILDINGS PASSED INTO THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
WITHOUT THE PHENOMENON OF DISINTEGRATION THIS FACT HE UTILIZED BY THE MEANS WHICH HE HAS DESCRIBED A LAMP HAVING A FILAMENTARY CARBON BURNER IN A NEARLY PERFECT VACUUM
WHICH WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE EMPLOYMENT OF SKILLED OPERATORS THE CONCEPTION OF THE STOCK TICKER DATES FROM THIS INCIDENT MISTER CALLAHAN'S FIRST IDEA WAS TO DISTRIBUTE GOLD QUOTATIONS AND TO THIS END HE DEVISED AN INDICATOR
PROBABLY PERFORMING MORE EXPERIMENTS IN THAT TIME THAN THE AGGREGATE OF THOSE OF ALL OTHER INVESTIGATORS EVEN IN THOSE EARLY DAYS HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LEAD SULPHURIC ACID COMBINATION WAS INTRINSICALLY WRONG AND DID NOT EMBRACE THE ELEMENTS
IN AN INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THIS PROPENSITY FOR EMULATION EXPRESSES ITSELF IN PECUNIARY EMULATION AND THIS SO FAR AS REGARDS THE WESTERN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES OF THE PRESENT IS VIRTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT EXPRESSES ITSELF IN SOME FORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
THE METHOD OF ADVERTISEMENT UNDERGOES A REFINEMENT WHEN A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE WEALTHY CLASS HAS DEVELOPED WHO HAVE THE LEISURE FOR ACQUIRING SKILL IN INTERPRETING THE SUBTLER SIGNS OF EXPENDITURE LOUD DRESS BECOMES OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE OF TASTE
BUT THE SCHEME OF LIFE OF THE CLASS IS IN LARGE PART A HERITAGE FROM THE PAST AND EMBODIES MUCH OF THE HABITS AND IDEALS OF THE EARLIER BARBARIAN PERIOD THIS ARCHAIC BARBARIAN SCHEME OF LIFE IMPOSES ITSELF ALSO ON THE LOWER ORDERS
THAT WHILE THE REGULATING NORM OF CONSUMPTION IS IN LARGE PART THE REQUIREMENT OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IT MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MOTIVE ON WHICH THE CONSUMER ACTS IN ANY GIVEN CASE IS THIS PRINCIPLE IN ITS BALD UNSOPHISTICATED FORM
THE CHANGING STYLES ARE THE EXPRESSION OF A RESTLESS SEARCH FOR SOMETHING WHICH SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO OUR AESTHETIC SENSE
IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SCRUPULOUSLY SCREENED AND MASKED UNDER AN OSTENSIBLE AUSTERITY IN THE MOST REPUTABLE LATTER DAY HOUSES OF WORSHIP WHERE NO EXPENSE IS SPARED THE PRINCIPLE OF AUSTERITY IS CARRIED TO THE LENGTH OF MAKING THE FITTINGS OF THE PLACE A MEANS OF MORTIFYING THE FLESH
THAT EACH SUCCESSIVE INNOVATION IN THE FASHIONS IS AN EFFORT TO REACH SOME FORM OF DISPLAY WHICH SHALL BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR SENSE OF FORM AND COLOR OR OF EFFECTIVENESS THAN THAT WHICH IT DISPLACES
THE ARTICLES OR FORMS OF CONSUMPTION TO WHICH THE CONSUMER CLINGS WITH THE GREATEST TENACITY ARE COMMONLY THE SO CALLED NECESSARIES OF LIFE OR THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM THE SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM IS OF COURSE NOT A RIGIDLY DETERMINED ALLOWANCE OF GOODS
AS HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE DISCUSSION OF WOMAN'S STATUS UNDER THE HEADS OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION IT HAS IN THE COURSE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BECOME THE OFFICE OF THE WOMAN TO CONSUME VICARIOUSLY FOR THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD
PRIESTLY DEMEANOR AT ITS BEST IS ALOOF LEISURELY PERFUNCTORY AND UNCONTAMINATED WITH SUGGESTIONS OF SENSUOUS PLEASURE THIS HOLDS TRUE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF COURSE FOR THE DIFFERENT CULTS AND DENOMINATIONS
A CLOSER EXAMINATION HOWEVER WILL SHOW THAT THIS APPARENT EXCEPTION IS REALLY A VERIFICATION OF THE RULE THAT THE VOGUE OF ANY GIVEN ELEMENT OR FEATURE IN DRESS RESTS ON ITS UTILITY AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STANDING
MUCH THE SAME MEANING ATTACHES TO THAT PECULIAR FACILITY OF HABITUATION TO A SPECIFIC HUMAN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CALLED ROMANTIC LOVE MEN DIFFER IN RESPECT OF TRANSMITTED APTITUDES
AND THE DUEL IS A LEISURE CLASS INSTITUTION THE DUEL IS IN SUBSTANCE A MORE OR LESS DELIBERATE RESORT TO A FIGHT AS A FINAL SETTLEMENT OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES IT PREVAILS AS A NORMAL PHENOMENON ONLY WHERE THERE IS AN HEREDITARY LEISURE CLASS
A SPECIFIC FORMAL OBSERVANCE CAN UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAINTAIN ITSELF IN FORCE IF WITH THE LAPSE OF TIME OR ON ITS TRANSMISSION TO A LOWER PECUNIARY CLASS IT IS FOUND TO RUN COUNTER TO THE ULTIMATE GROUND OF DECENCY AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES NAMELY
WITH FEW AND INCONSEQUENTIAL EXCEPTIONS WE ALL FIND A COSTLY HAND WROUGHT ARTICLE OF APPAREL MUCH PREFERABLE IN POINT OF BEAUTY AND OF SERVICEABILITY TO A LESS EXPENSIVE IMITATION OF IT
IMPLIES PRIVATION AT THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE IT IS A COMMONPLACE THAT WHEREVER IT OCCURS A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF PRIVATION AMONG THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE IS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO ANY INNOVATION
IS ALWAYS SO TRANSPARENT A MAKE BELIEVE AND THEIR SUBSTANTIAL FUTILITY PRESENTLY FORCES ITSELF SO BALDLY UPON OUR ATTENTION AS TO BECOME UNBEARABLE AND THEN WE TAKE REFUGE IN A NEW STYLE
TO THE EXTENT OF ARRAYING THEMSELVES IN APPAREL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO VEX THE MORTAL FRAME BUT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WITHOUT HESITATION THAT SUCH APPAREL FOR MEN IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE NORMAL
SUCH TRAITS AS GO TO MAKE UP THEIR IDEAL OF A WORTHY MAN AND IN SEEKING COMMUNION WITH THE DIVINITY THE WAYS AND MEANS OF APPROACH ARE ASSIMILATED AS NEARLY AS MAY BE TO THE DIVINE IDEAL THAT IS IN MEN'S MINDS AT THE TIME
BUT IT IS FELT BY ALL MEN THAT A RIGHT AND ENLIGHTENED SENSE OF THE TRUE THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE GOOD DEMANDS THAT IN ALL EXPENDITURE ON THE SANCTUARY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SERVE THE COMFORT OF THE WORSHIPPER SHOULD BE CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IF ANY ELEMENT OF COMFORT IS ADMITTED IN THE FITTINGS OF THE SANCTUARY
THIS ARRESTED SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT MAY EXPRESS ITSELF NOT ONLY IN A DIRECT PARTICIPATION BY ADULTS IN YOUTHFUL EXPLOITS OF FEROCITY BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY IN AIDING AND ABETTING DISTURBANCES OF THIS KIND ON THE PART OF YOUNGER PERSONS
ON THE OTHER HAND THE ASSERTION FREELY GOES UNCONTRADICTED THAT STYLES IN VOGUE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO ARE MORE BECOMING THAN THE MOST ELABORATE AND PAINSTAKING CONSTRUCTIONS OF TODAY
TO ATTAIN THE BEAUTIFUL IN DRESS SHOULD BE A GRADUAL APPROACH TO ARTISTIC PERFECTION WE MIGHT NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE FASHIONS SHOULD SHOW A WELL MARKED TREND
OR IN RESPECT OF THE RELATIVE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY UNFOLD THEIR LIFE ACTIVITY IN PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AND THE HABITS WHICH COINCIDE WITH OR PROCEED UPON A RELATIVELY STRONG SPECIFIC APTITUDE OR A RELATIVELY GREAT SPECIFIC FACILITY OF EXPRESSION BECOME OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO THE MAN'S WELL BEING
WILL BE THE VARYING STYLES THAT SUCCESSIVELY COME INTO VOGUE THERE REMAINS AT LEAST ONE POINT IN THIS THEORY OF DRESS YET TO BE DISCUSSED MOST OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID APPLIES TO MEN'S ATTIRE AS WELL AS TO THAT OF WOMEN
IT IS EASILY CALLED INTO VIGOROUS ACTIVITY IN ANY NEW FORM AND IT ASSERTS ITSELF WITH GREAT INSISTENCE UNDER ANY FORM UNDER WHICH IT HAS ONCE FOUND HABITUAL EXPRESSION WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL HAS ONCE FORMED THE HABIT OF SEEKING EXPRESSION IN A GIVEN LINE OF HONORIFIC EXPENDITURE
THIS IS THE SIGNIFICANCE FOR INSTANCE OF THE FOSTERING CARE LATTERLY BESTOWED BY MANY CLERGYMEN
IT MAY BROADLY BE SET DOWN THAT THE WOMANLINESS OF WOMAN'S APPAREL RESOLVES ITSELF IN POINT OF SUBSTANTIAL FACT INTO THE MORE EFFECTIVE HINDRANCE TO USEFUL EXERTION OFFERED BY THE GARMENTS PECULIAR TO WOMEN
ELEGANT DRESS SERVES ITS PURPOSE OF ELEGANCE NOT ONLY IN THAT IT IS EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS THE INSIGNIA OF LEISURE IT NOT ONLY SHOWS THAT THE WEARER IS ABLE TO CONSUME A RELATIVELY LARGE VALUE
THE HOMELY REASON FOR ALL THIS CONSPICUOUS LEISURE AND ATTIRE ON THE PART OF WOMEN LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SERVANTS TO WHOM IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS
THE ENERGIES OF THE INDUSTRIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE BENT TO THE COMPASSING OF A HIGHER RESULT IN CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE RATHER THAN SLACKENED TO A MORE COMFORTABLE PACE THE STRAIN IS NOT LIGHTENED AS INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY INCREASES AND MAKES A LIGHTER STRAIN POSSIBLE
IN GIRLS THE TRANSITION TO THE PREDACEOUS STAGE IS SELDOM ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF COMPLETENESS AS IN BOYS AND IN A RELATIVELY LARGE PROPORTION OF CASES IT IS SCARCELY UNDERGONE AT ALL IN SUCH CASES THE TRANSITION FROM INFANCY TO ADOLESCENCE
INDIRECTLY THEIR ECONOMIC OFFICE MAY OF COURSE BE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMIC LIFE PROCESS
IN THE LATTER CASE THE SANCTUARY AND THE SACRED APPARATUS ARE SO CONTRIVED AS NOT TO ENHANCE THE COMFORT OR FULLNESS OF LIFE OF THE VICARIOUS CONSUMER OR AT ANY RATE NOT TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE END OF THEIR CONSUMPTION IS THE CONSUMER'S COMFORT
THE MORE PERSISTENTLY WILL THE GIVEN HABIT ASSERT ITSELF THE HABIT WILL BE STRONGER IF THE PARTICULAR TRAITS OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH ITS ACTION INVOLVES OR THE PARTICULAR APTITUDES THAT FIND EXERCISE IN IT ARE TRAITS OR APTITUDES THAT ARE ALREADY LARGELY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED IN THE LIFE PROCESS
THE ONLY POSSIBLE RESULT OF WHICH WOULD BE DISCONTENT AND DISASTROUS REACTION ALL THIS HOWEVER IS BESIDE THE PRESENT ARGUMENT
THE REASON FOR THE DISCREPANCY IS COMMONLY TO BE SOUGHT IN A RATE OF INCREASE IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S WEALTH TOO RAPID FOR THE HABIT OF EXPENDITURE TO KEEP ABREAST OF IT OR IT MAY BE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION DEFERS THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF THE INCREMENT TO A LATER DATE
FOR DECREASING THE VISIBLE EFFICIENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOMETHING SIMILAR SHOULD HOLD TRUE WITH RESPECT TO DIVERS ITEMS OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND INDEED SOMETHING OF THE KIND DOES SEEM TO HOLD TO A SLIGHT DEGREE OF SUNDRY FEATURES OF DRESS
THE SANCTUARY AND ITS FITTINGS HAVE SOMETHING OF THIS AUSTERITY IN ALL THE CULTS IN WHICH THE SAINT OR DIVINITY TO WHOM THE SANCTUARY PERTAINS IS NOT CONCEIVED TO BE PRESENT AND MAKE PERSONAL USE OF THE PROPERTY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF LUXURIOUS TASTES IMPUTED TO HIM
FROM THE ACCEPTED CODE OF MORALS IN MODERN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FEATURE OF THE COMMUNITY'S LIFE IS THE INSTITUTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ONE OF THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CODE OF MORALS IS THE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY
WHEN SEEN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF HALF A DOZEN YEARS OR MORE THE BEST OF OUR FASHIONS STRIKE US AS GROTESQUE IF NOT UNSIGHTLY OUR TRANSIENT ATTACHMENT TO WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE THE LATEST RESTS ON OTHER THAN AESTHETIC GROUNDS
HOW GREATLY THE TRANSMITTED IDIOSYNCRASIES OF APTITUDE MAY COUNT IN THE WAY OF A RAPID AND DEFINITIVE FORMATION OF HABIT IN INDIVIDUALS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE EXTREME FACILITY WITH WHICH AN ALL DOMINATING HABIT OF ALCOHOLISM IS SOMETIMES FORMED
WITH WHICH ANY EVIDENCE OF INDIGENCE OR SQUALOR ABOUT THE SACRED PLACE AFFECTS ALL BEHOLDERS
THIS CLASS DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERAMENT MAY BE DUE IN PART TO A DIFFERENCE IN THE INHERITANCE OF ACQUIRED TRAITS IN THE SEVERAL CLASSES BUT IT SEEMS ALSO IN SOME MEASURE TO CORRESPOND WITH A DIFFERENCE IN ETHNIC DERIVATION
ASSIMILATES THEM TO THE CLASS OF SERVANTS AND SHOWS MANY OF THE FEATURES THAT GO TO MAKE UP THE WOMANLINESS OF WOMAN'S DRESS THIS IS THE PRIESTLY CLASS PRIESTLY VESTMENTS SHOW IN ACCENTUATED FORM
THE GOOD NAME OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO WHICH SHE BELONGS SHOULD BE THE SPECIAL CARE OF THE WOMAN
OR OF THE THEISTIC FAITH IN ANY COUNTRY OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION OR SUPPOSE THE SUPPRESSION OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP IN CHINA OR OF THE CASTE SYSTEM IN INDIA OR OF SLAVERY IN AFRICA
A SIMILAR USAGE PREVAILS AMONG THE BOYS OF THE COMMUNITY THE BOY USUALLY KNOWS TO NICETY FROM DAY TO DAY HOW HE AND HIS ASSOCIATES GRADE IN RESPECT OF RELATIVE FIGHTING CAPACITY AND IN THE COMMUNITY OF BOYS THERE IS ORDINARILY
EVEN WHERE THE ELEMENT OF DESTRUCTIVE PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY IS NOT AN OBTRUSIVE FEATURE SPORTS SHADE OFF FROM THE BASIS OF HOSTILE COMBAT THROUGH SKILL TO CUNNING AND CHICANERY WITHOUT ITS BEING POSSIBLE TO DRAW A LINE AT ANY POINT
OF LEISURE EXEMPTION FROM PERSONAL CONTACT WITH INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES OF ANY KIND MUCH OF THE CHARM THAT INVESTS THE PATENT LEATHER SHOE THE STAINLESS LINEN THE LUSTROUS CYLINDRICAL HAT AND THE WALKING STICK
ORDINARILY HIS MOTIVE IS A WISH TO CONFORM TO ESTABLISHED USAGE TO AVOID UNFAVORABLE NOTICE AND COMMENT TO LIVE UP TO THE ACCEPTED CANONS OF DECENCY IN THE KIND AMOUNT AND GRADE OF GOODS CONSUMED
PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT THIS CONSIDERATION WARRANTS US IN SAYING IS THAT THE NORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE EXERCISES A CONTROLLING SURVEILLANCE IN ALL MATTERS OF DRESS
THERE THE IMMEDIATE INFERENCE IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION DOES NOT PERFORM THIS WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND UNDERGO THIS DISABILITY FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN IN PECUNIARY REPUTE
THE FACT THAT THE USAGES ACTIONS AND VIEWS OF THE WELL TO DO LEISURE CLASS ACQUIRE THE CHARACTER OF A PRESCRIPTIVE CANON OF CONDUCT FOR THE REST OF SOCIETY GIVES ADDED WEIGHT AND REACH TO THE CONSERVATIVE INFLUENCE OF THAT CLASS
NOR DOES IT SAY THAT THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE FIRED WITH MARTIAL ARDOR FOR A TIME UNDER THE STIMULUS OF SOME SPECIAL PROVOCATION SUCH AS IS SEEN IN OPERATION TODAY IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
WILL SHOW THAT IT IS CONTRIVED AT EVERY POINT TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WEARER DOES NOT HABITUALLY PUT FORTH ANY USEFUL EFFORT IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT NO APPAREL CAN BE CONSIDERED ELEGANT OR EVEN DECENT
ALSO AS REGARDS THE SENSE OF DEVOUT OR RITUAL MERIT AND ADEQUACY IN THIS CONNECTION LITTLE NEED BE SAID IN THIS PLACE THAT TOPIC WILL ALSO COME UP INCIDENTALLY IN A LATER CHAPTER STILL
IS RATHER AVERSE TO ANY OTHER THAN A DEFENSIVE FIGHT INDEED IT RESPONDS A LITTLE TARDILY EVEN TO A PROVOCATION WHICH MAKES FOR AN ATTITUDE OF DEFENSE IN THE MORE CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES OR RATHER IN THE COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE REACHED AN ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
THAT IN THE COUNTRIES OF CIVILIZED EUROPE THE HEREDITARY LEISURE CLASS IS ENDOWED WITH THIS MARTIAL SPIRIT IN A HIGHER DEGREE THAN THE MIDDLE CLASSES INDEED THE LEISURE CLASS CLAIMS THE DISTINCTION AS A MATTER OF PRIDE AND NO DOUBT WITH SOME GROUNDS
A MORE OR LESS PROTRACTED AND LABORIOUS EFFORT TO FIND AND TO KEEP ONE'S BEARINGS UNDER THE ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PROCESS REQUIRES A CERTAIN EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY AND SO PRESUMES FOR ITS SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT
WHICH ALONE THEY OSTENSIBLY ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE UNDER THE SELECTIVE SURVEILLANCE OF THE LAW OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THERE GROWS UP A CODE OF ACCREDITED CANONS OF CONSUMPTION THE EFFECT OF WHICH IS TO HOLD THE CONSUMER UP TO A STANDARD OF EXPENSIVENESS AND WASTEFULNESS
FROM ANYTHING HABITUALLY PRACTICED BY THE MEN THIS FEATURE IS THE CLASS OF CONTRIVANCES OF WHICH THE CORSET IS THE TYPICAL EXAMPLE THE CORSET IS IN ECONOMIC THEORY SUBSTANTIALLY A MUTILATION
THESE CLASSES HAVE LITTLE ELSE THAN A BUSINESS INTEREST IN THINGS ECONOMIC AND ON THEM AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CHIEFLY INCUMBENT TO DELIBERATE UPON THE COMMUNITY'S AFFAIRS THE RELATION OF THE LEISURE THAT IS PROPERTIED NON INDUSTRIAL
NEARLY INDISPENSABLE TO A SOCIALLY BLAMELESS STANDING FOR ALL WOMEN INCLUDING THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST REPUTABLE THIS RULE HELD SO LONG AS THERE STILL WAS NO LARGE CLASS OF PEOPLE WEALTHY ENOUGH TO BE ABOVE THE IMPUTATION
CONSISTENTLY ACTS TO RETARD THAT ADJUSTMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS CALLED SOCIAL ADVANCE OR DEVELOPMENT THE CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE OF THE CLASS MAY BE SUMMED UP IN THE MAXIM
THE PREDATORY CULTURE PROPER IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MUCH ELSE THE LEISURE CLASS AND THE DELINQUENT CLASS CHARACTER SHOWS A PERSISTENCE INTO ADULT LIFE OF TRAITS THAT ARE NORMAL TO CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH
TO LEAVE BUT A SCANTY SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM AVAILABLE FOR OTHER THAN CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AND TWO
ESPECIALLY IF SUCH FEATURES INVOLVE A MARKED DISCOMFORT OR APPEARANCE OF DISCOMFORT TO THE WEARER DURING THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS THERE IS A TENDENCY PERCEPTIBLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEN'S DRESS ESPECIALLY
WHEREAS THE LAW OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO HUMAN INSTITUTIONS GIVES THE AXIOM
IT IS PLEASING TO OUR SENSE OF WHAT IS FITTING IN THESE MATTERS IN EITHER CASE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE OBVIOUS PERFUNCTORINESS OF THE SERVICE THAT IT IS A PRO FORMA EXECUTION ONLY
AND SIMILAR PSEUDO MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO THE GROWTH OF COLLEGE SPIRIT COLLEGE ATHLETICS AND THE LIKE IN THE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING THESE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PREDATORY TEMPERAMENT ARE ALL TO BE CLASSED UNDER THE HEAD OF EXPLOIT
AND THAT IT WILL READILY UNFOLD IN A NEW DIRECTION WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE TO SELF EXPRESSION DECREASES BUT WHEN THE HABIT OF EXPRESSION ALONG SUCH A GIVEN LINE OF LOW RESISTANCE HAS ONCE BEEN FORMED
BUT THE INCREMENT OF OUTPUT IS TURNED TO USE TO MEET THIS WANT WHICH IS INDEFINITELY EXPANSIBLE AFTER THE MANNER COMMONLY IMPUTED IN ECONOMIC THEORY TO HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL WANTS
THE SACRED BUILDINGS AND THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE CULT ARE CONSTRUCTED AND DECORATED WITH SOME VIEW TO A REPUTABLE DEGREE OF WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND IT NEEDS BUT LITTLE EITHER OF OBSERVATION OR INTROSPECTION AND EITHER WILL SERVE THE TURN
AND THE CORSET HAS THEREFORE IN LARGE MEASURE FALLEN INTO DISUSE WITHIN THIS CLASS THE EXCEPTIONS UNDER THIS RULE OF EXEMPTION FROM THE CORSET ARE MORE APPARENT THAN REAL
A WELL BRED EXPENDITURE OF HIS BOOTY ESPECIALLY APPEALS WITH GREAT EFFECT TO PERSONS OF A CULTIVATED SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES AND GOES FAR TO MITIGATE THE SENSE OF MORAL TURPITUDE WITH WHICH HIS DERELICTION IS VIEWED BY THEM IT MAY BE NOTED ALSO
IS SO IMPERATIVELY NECESSARY AS WE KNOW IT TO BE FOR A CREATIVE PRINCIPLE CAPABLE OF SERVING AS MOTIVE TO INVENTION AND INNOVATION IN FASHIONS WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE PRIMITIVE NON ECONOMIC MOTIVE
CHAPTER SIX PECUNIARY CANONS OF TASTE THE CAUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE
AND THE PREDATORY TEMPER OF WHICH IT IS THE INDEX PREVAIL IN THE LARGEST MEASURE AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES ESPECIALLY AMONG THE HEREDITARY LEISURE CLASS MOREOVER THE OSTENSIBLE SERIOUS OCCUPATION OF THE UPPER CLASS IS THAT OF GOVERNMENT WHICH
OF A PECUNIARY STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY BACK DIRECTLY AND BALDLY TO THE UNDERLYING NORM OF PECUNIARY EMULATION
THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS A REFINEMENT OF METHODS A RESORT TO SUBTLER CONTRIVANCES AND A SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE SCHEME OF SYMBOLISM IN DRESS
BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS WRONG TO SOME EXTENT THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A MORE OR LESS INADEQUATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE METHODS OF LIVING TO A SITUATION WHICH PREVAILED AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST DEVELOPMENT
IN THE COMMON RUN OF CASES THE CONSCIOUS MOTIVE OF THE WEARER OR PURCHASER OF CONSPICUOUSLY WASTEFUL APPAREL IS THE NEED OF CONFORMING TO ESTABLISHED USAGE
AND TWO ENGLISH SOLDIERS WENT ALONG THE ROAD TALKING LIKE IN MISTER KIPLING'S BOOKS SO AFTER THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE ANY DOUBT AS TO WHERE THEY WERE THEY ROLLED UP THE CARPET AND ROBERT CARRIED IT AND THEY WALKED BODILY INTO THE TOWN
ALL THESE INDIAN THINGS ARE FOR PRETTY NICE MISS PEASMARSH'S STALL SHE THOUGHT OF ADDING THERE IS NOTHING FOR MISSUS BIDDLE BUT SHE SAW THAT THIS MIGHT LEAD TO SUSPICION SO SHE WROTE HASTILY FROM AN UNKNOWN DONNA
AND INDEED THE CROWD ROUND THE DOORS LOOKED AS THICK AS FLIES IN THE JAM MAKING SEASON I WISH WE'D NEVER SEEN THE PHOENIX CRIED JANE EVEN AT THAT AWFUL MOMENT
THE CARPET SEEMED TO AWAKEN TO NEW ENERGY AS SOON AS IT HAD GOT RID OF THEIR WEIGHT AND IT ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR THE OTHERS LAY DOWN FLAT AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE RISING CARPET ARE YOU HURT CRIED CYRIL AND ROBERT SHOUTED NO
HE WRIGGLES EVEN IN HIS SLEEP CROCKY SAID THE LAMB AND SHOWED ALL HIS LITTLE TEETH SO ANTHEA WENT ON I LOVE MY LITTLE CROCODILE I LOVE HIS TRUTHFUL TOOTHFUL SMILE
WE WILL WE WILL SAID ANTHEA FERVENTLY WHEN'S THE BAZAAR ON SATURDAY SAID MOTHER AT THE SCHOOLS OH DON'T TALK ANY MORE THERE'S A TREASURE MY HEAD'S GOING ROUND AND I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SPELL WHOOPING COUGH
CYRIL'S STORIES HAD TAKEN SOME TIME SO HAD THE MEAL OF STRANGE SWEET FOODS THAT THEY HAD HAD WHILE THE LITTLE PRETTY THINGS WERE BEING BOUGHT AND THE GAS IN THE SCHOOLROOM WAS ALREADY LIGHTED
I MEAN THE GREY ONE WITH THE RED TAIL ALL EYES WERE ON THE STAGE WHERE THE LOBSTER WAS DELIGHTING THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT GEM OF A SONG IF YOU CAN'T WALK STRAIGHT WALK SIDEWAYS WHEN THE PHOENIX MURMURED WARMLY
WE COULDN'T FIND YOU OF COURSE AND WE COULDN'T GET IN BUT THE FIREMEN TOLD US EVERY ONE WAS SAFELY OUT
YES SAID JANE BEFORE ROBERT COULD SAY YOU SHUT UP YOU MUST HAVE READ ABOUT IT THE PHOENIX IS WITH THEM THEN THE LADY GOT UP AND PICKING HER WAY CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE PILES OF CLOTHES SHE GOT TO THE DOOR AND THROUGH IT SHE SHUT IT BEHIND HER AND THE TWO CHILDREN COULD HEAR HER CALLING SEPTIMUS
HUNG ON BEHIND THE CAB TILL IT REACHED MISSUS BIDDLE'S HOUSE WHEN SHE AND THE CARPET HAD GONE IN AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT ANTHEA SAID DON'T LET'S BURGLE I MEAN DO DARING AND DASHING RESCUE ACTS TILL WE'VE GIVEN HER A CHANCE
I OPENED THE BOX MYSELF THIS MORNING I FOUND I HAD NOT ENOUGH SMALL CHANGE FOR THE MOTHERS INDEPENDENT UNITY MEASLES AND CROUP INSURANCE PAYMENTS I SUPPOSE THIS IS NOT A DREAM IS IT DREAM NO INDEED SEARCH THE HOUSE I INSIST UPON IT
AND SHE WAS STARING AT THE LAMB AS IF SHE THOUGHT HE HAD GONE MAD AND INDEED THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID THINK MY LAMB MY PRECIOUS COME TO MOTHER SHE CRIED AND JUMPED UP AND RAN TO THE BABY
AND ANTHEA WHOSE INSIDE MIND WAS MADE SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO BE MUCH MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN THE OTHERS HAD DECIDED THAT SHE MUST TELL HER MOTHER THE TRUTH HOWEVER LITTLE LIKELY IT WAS THAT HER MOTHER WOULD BELIEVE IT
I AM OLD I AM WEARY I FEEL AS IF I OUGHT TO LAY MY EGG AND LAY ME DOWN TO MY FIERY SLEEP BUT UNLESS I'M CAREFUL I SHALL BE HATCHED AGAIN INSTANTLY
IT WAS TRUE AND YOU'RE SAFE MOTHER BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN AND FATHER SAID BED WAS A GOOD PLACE AFTER THE PLEASURES OF THE STAGE SO EVERY ONE WENT THERE
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES ADIEU AND WAVING A CHEERY FAREWELL WITH HIS NEAT UMBRELLA THE GOOD AND HIGH HATTED UNCLE PASSED AWAY LEAVING CYRIL AND ANTHEA TO EXCHANGE ELOQUENT GLANCES OVER THE SHINING GOLDEN SOVEREIGN THAT LAY IN CYRIL'S HAND WELL SAID ANTHEA
THE DOOR FELL BACK WITH A HOLLOW CLANG ON THE LEADS BEHIND AND WITH ITS NOISE WAS MINGLED A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM FROM UNDERNEATH DISCOVERED HISSED ROBERT OH MY CATS ALIVE THEY WERE INDEED DISCOVERED
TELL HIM HE HAS MY LEAVE TO SELL MY GIFT AND CLOTHE THE NAKED WITH ITS PRICE SAID THE QUEEN WHEN THIS WAS TRANSLATED BUT CYRIL SAID VERY FIRMLY NO THANK YOU THE THINGS HAVE GOT TO BE SOLD TO DAY AT OUR BAZAAR AND NO ONE WOULD BUY A TURQUOISE NECKLACE AT AN ENGLISH BAZAAR
BOUGHT SUCH A BAD BARGAIN AS THAT CARPET A SOFT OH
IT SAID IT WANTED A WEEK'S REST AND ASKED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED AND IT HID ITS GOLDEN GLEAMING SELF AND NOBODY COULD FIND IT
OF COURSE YOU SHALL HAVE THE CARPET MY DEARS IF YOU'VE TAKEN SUCH A FANCY TO IT NO NO I WON'T HAVE MORE THAN THE TEN SHILLINGS I PAID IT DOES SEEM HARD TO ASK YOU FOR IT AFTER YOU BOUGHT IT AT THE BAZAAR SAID ANTHEA BUT IT REALLY IS OUR NURSERY CARPET
AND SAYING YOU WERE NICE AND PRETTY IT'S NOT THE WORK OF A SANE PERSON
SAID ANTHEA AS THE EDGE OF THE CARPET GRAZED A CHIMNEY POT THAT'S RIGHT BE CAREFUL SAID THE PHOENIX IN WARNING TONES IF YOU WISH WHEN YOU'RE ON A WISHING CARPET YOU DO WISH AND THERE'S AN END OF IT
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN SHOCK HEADED PETER LAST YEAR YOUR WORDS ARE STRANGE SAID THE PHOENIX BUT I WILL COME WITH YOU
AND SHE HELPED THEM TO ROLL UP THE CARPET AND THE BOYS CARRIED IT AWAY BETWEEN THEM YOU ARE A DEAR SAID ANTHEA AND SHE AND MISSUS BIDDLE KISSED EACH OTHER HEARTILY WELL SAID CYRIL AS THEY WENT ALONG THE STREET
IT IS SO WONDERFUL AND WIDE I LIKE TO SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE WELL YOU SEE CYRIL WAS SAYING IT'S JUST THE OLD BOTHER MOTHER CAN'T BELIEVE THE REAL TRUE TRUTH ABOUT THE CARPET AND
BUT OH HE HAS A DREADFUL HABIT OF PADDLING OUT AMONG THE ROCKS AND SOAKING BOTH HIS BUNNY SOCKS I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE ABOUT THE SONS OF THE PHOENIX REALLY SAID ROBERT
ANTHEA SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO DRAW THE EDGES OF THE BROKEN DARN TOGETHER AND CYRIL HASTILY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A LARGE PIECE OF THE MARBLE PATTERNED AMERICAN OIL CLOTH WHICH CAREFUL HOUSE WIVES USE TO COVER DRESSERS AND KITCHEN TABLES IT WAS THE STRONGEST THING HE COULD THINK OF
THEN WE COULDN'T SPEND IT AND PEOPLE WOULD BOTHER ABOUT WHERE WE GOT IT AND WE SHOULDN'T KNOW HOW ON EARTH TO GET OUT OF IT AT ALL CYRIL MOVED THE TABLE OFF THE CARPET AS HE SPOKE AND ITS LEG CAUGHT IN ONE OF ANTHEA'S DARNS AND RIPPED AWAY MOST OF IT AS WELL AS A LARGE SLIT IN THE CARPET
ONCE MORE HER FACE GREW VIOLET A DEEP DARK VIOLET YOU WICKED DARING LITTLE THINGS SHE CRIED HOW DARE YOU COME HERE AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT TOO BE OFF OR I'LL SEND FOR THE POLICE
AND WE TOOK COOK BECAUSE SHE WAS SO TIRESOME AND THEN SHE WOULD STAY AND BE QUEEN OF THE SAVAGES THEY THOUGHT HER CAP WAS A CROWN AND DARLING ONE SAID MOTHER YOU KNOW I LOVE TO HEAR THE THINGS YOU MAKE UP BUT I AM MOST AWFULLY BUSY
MOTHER AND FATHER OH HOW AWFUL THEY'LL THINK WE'RE BURNED TO CINDERS OH LET'S GO THIS MINUTE AND TELL THEM WE AREN'T WE SHOULD ONLY MISS THEM SAID THE SENSIBLE CYRIL WELL YOU GO THEN SAID ANTHEA OR I WILL
THAT THE LADIES LEAPED WITH SURPRISE AND NEARLY LET THEM GO IT'S OUR OWN CLERGYMAN CRIED JANE DON'T YOU REMEMBER US ASKED ROBERT YOU MARRIED OUR BURGLAR FOR US DON'T YOU REMEMBER I KNEW IT WAS A GANG SAID AMELIA
AND THE MOMENT THEIR FEET WERE ON THE CARPET ANTHEA WISHED TO BE AT HOME AND INSTANTLY THEY WERE THE KINDNESS OF THEIR EXCELLENT UNCLE HAD MADE IT UNNECESSARY FOR THEM TO GO TO SUCH EXTREMES AS CYRIL'S ETONS OR ANTHEA'S SUNDAY JACKET FOR THE PATCHING OF THE CARPET
STAND ON THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CARPET WHICH ARE TRULY ANTIQUE AND AUTHENTIC AND A SUDDEN JET OF FLAME STOPPED ITS WORDS ALAS THE PHOENIX HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY WARMED TO ITS SUBJECT AND IN THE UNINTENTIONAL HEAT OF THE MOMENT
BUT I COULD SEE THE POOR DEAR FELLOW'S BRAIN GIVING WAY BEFORE MY VERY EYES HE COULDN'T HAVE STOOD THE STRAIN OF THREE DREAMS IT WAS ODD WASN'T IT ALL THREE OF US DREAMING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME MOMENT WE MUST NEVER TELL DEAR SEPPY BUT I SHALL SEND AN ACCOUNT OF IT TO THE PSYCHICAL SOCIETY
OH SAID MISS PEASMARSH RADIANTLY DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE CARPET I'VE SOLD EVEN THAT MISSUS BIDDLE GAVE ME TEN SHILLINGS FOR IT
IT FLAPPED ITS GOLDEN WINGS AND CRIED IN A VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE THEATRE WELL DONE MY SERVANTS YE HAVE MY FAVOUR AND MY COUNTENANCE LITTLE TOM ON THE STAGE STOPPED SHORT IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING
IN YOUR MIND PERHAPS SAID JANE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IN YOUR BODY YOU'D GET TOO BALLOONY THE PHOENIX YAWNED LOOK HERE SAID ANTHEA I REALLY HAVE AN IDEA
THE ROOM WAS A STUDY CALM AND GENTLEMANLY WITH ROWS OF BOOKS A WRITING TABLE AND A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED SLIPPERS WARMING THEMSELVES IN THE FENDER THE CHILDREN HID BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS AS THEY PASSED THE TABLE THEY SAW ON IT
CRIED MISSUS BIDDLE AND HER VOICE SHOOK WITH ANGRINESS YOU DO LOOK HORRID SAID JANE SUDDENLY MISSUS BIDDLE ACTUALLY STAMPED THAT BOOTED FOOT OF HERS
NO SAID THE GIRLS TOGETHER THERE MUST BE SOME WAY WAIT A SEC ANTHEA ADDED I'VE GOT AN IDEA COMING DON'T SPEAK THERE WAS A SILENCE AS SHE PAUSED WITH THE DARNING NEEDLE IN THE AIR SUDDENLY SHE SPOKE
I WISH MISSUS BIDDLE WAS IN AN ANGELIC GOOD TEMPER CRIED ANTHEA SUDDENLY IT'S WORTH TRYING SHE SAID TO HERSELF MISSUS BIDDLE'S FACE GREW FROM PURPLE TO VIOLET AND FROM VIOLET TO MAUVE AND FROM MAUVE TO PINK
AND I'M CERTAIN IT'LL SEE US THROUGH SOMEHOW I BELIEVE IN THE PHOENIX THE PHOENIX THANKS YOU O ROBERT SAID A GOLDEN VOICE AT HIS FEET AND THERE WAS THE PHOENIX ITSELF ON THE WISHING CARPET QUICK IT SAID
WHAT I MUST TELL YOU IS THAT THOUGH CYRIL AND JANE AND ROBERT AND ANTHEA ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS ANY CHILDREN POSSIBLY COULD THE PLEASURE OF THE PHOENIX WAS FAR FAR GREATER THAN THEIRS
MY HAND IS SWOLLEN AS BIG AS A PUDDING I EXPECT THE NAILS IN HER HORRIBLE BOOTS WERE POISONED JUST THEN SOME ONE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE A RIGHT TO INTERFERE SAID EVERYTHING IS OVER NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME SO THEY WENT
MOTHER LAID DOWN HER PEN AND HER NICE FACE HAD A RESIGNED EXPRESSION AS YOU KNOW A RESIGNED EXPRESSION ALWAYS MAKES YOU WANT NOT TO TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING IT'S LIKE THIS SAID ANTHEA IN A HURRY
WE MIGHT GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE PALACE
WELL SAID CYRIL WELL SAID THE PHOENIX GOOD OLD CARPET SAID CYRIL JOYOUSLY IT WAS CLEVER OF IT SO ADEQUATE AND YET SO SIMPLE SAID THE PHOENIX WITH CALM APPROVAL
THEN THEY SET TO WORK TO LINE THE CARPET THROUGHOUT WITH THE OIL CLOTH THE NURSERY FELT VERY ODD AND EMPTY WITHOUT THE OTHERS AND CYRIL DID NOT FEEL SO SURE AS HE HAD DONE ABOUT THEIR BEING ABLE TO TRAM IT HOME SO HE TRIED TO HELP ANTHEA WHICH WAS VERY GOOD OF HIM BUT NOT MUCH USE TO HER
EXACTED IN THE AGITATION OF PARTING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE OUT AFTER SIX AT NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAY WHEN THEY WERE TO GO TO THE BAZAAR AND WERE PLEDGED TO PUT ON THEIR BEST CLOTHES TO WASH THEMSELVES TO THE UTTERMOST AND TO CLEAN THEIR NAILS
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE PHOENIX IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST THE FAULT OF THE THEATRE PEOPLE AND NO ONE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND AFTERWARDS HOW IT DID HAPPEN NO ONE THAT IS
AND ANTHEA MOTHER LOOKED AT THEM QUICKLY AND SAID WELL OF COURSE I SEE YOU'VE MENDED IT VERY NICELY AND THAT WAS SWEET OF YOU DEARS THE BOYS HELPED TOO SAID THE DEARS HONOURABLY BUT STILL
THEY WERE VERY NICE TABLEAUX THESE AND I WISH I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THEM BUT ONE CANNOT TELL EVERYTHING IN A STORY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE TABLEAU OF THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER
YOU CANNOT TELL ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME
AND THEN THEY BOTH CLIMBED UP VERY CAREFULLY AND PUT THEIR TWO TRIM TIDY HEADS OUT OF THE TRAP DOOR TO LOOK FOR THE MAD CHILDREN NOW WHISPERED ROBERT GETTING THE BEDSTEAD LEG OUT OF HIS SIDE
PEOPLE WHISPERED THEN PEOPLE SHRIEKED FIRE FIRE THE CURTAIN WENT DOWN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FIRE CRIED EVERY ONE AND MADE FOR THE DOORS
OH HOW AWFUL SAID ANTHEA
IT WAS VERY HOT THE THEATRE WAS A PIT OF FIRE
AND AS THEY WENT AWAY THEY HEARD THE CURATE SAY
SUPPOSE IT TOOK US SOMEWHERE FOREIGN AND THE PURSE WAS COVERED WITH STRANGE EASTERN DEVICES EMBROIDERED IN RICH SILKS AND FULL OF MONEY THAT WASN'T MONEY AT ALL HERE ONLY FOREIGN CURIOSITIES
I SAID IT WAS THE BIRD THAT SPOKE SAID MOTHER AND SO IT WAS OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THEN IT WASN'T A PIGEON IT WAS AN ORANGE COLOURED COCKATOO I DON'T CARE WHO IT WAS THAT SPOKE
I DON'T THINK SO SAID CYRIL IT'S CALLED THE WATER BABIES AND IF IT'S LIKE THE BOOK THERE ISN'T ANY GLADIATING IN IT THERE ARE CHIMNEY SWEEPS AND PROFESSORS AND A LOBSTER AND AN OTTER AND A SALMON AND CHILDREN LIVING IN THE WATER
THEN THE PLAY WENT ON AND AN ATTENDANT PRESENTLY CAME TO THE BOX AND SPOKE WRATHFULLY IT WASN'T US INDEED IT WASN'T SAID ANTHEA EARNESTLY IT WAS THE BIRD THE MAN SAID
AND AT THAT BOTH ROBERT AND JANE SUDDENLY AND AT ONCE MADE A BOUND TO TRY AND GET ON TO THE SAFER PART OF THE CARPET AND THE DARN GAVE WAY AND THEIR BOOTS WENT UP AND THE HEAVY HEADS AND BODIES OF THEM WENT DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE
MY RANEE SHE THINK YOU VERY NICE CHILDS SHE ASKS DO YOU LOSE YOURSELVES AND DO YOU DESIRE TO SELL CARPET SHE SEE YOU FROM HER PALKEE
AND MOTHER LOOKING LOVELY IN HER GREY EVENING DRESS THAT CHANGES INTO PINK AND GREEN WHEN SHE MOVES ROBERT PRETENDED THAT HE WAS TOO COLD TO TAKE OFF HIS GREAT COAT
A MAGNIFICENT IDEA SAID THE PHOENIX COMPLACENTLY AN ENORMOUS ALTAR FIRE SUPPLIED FREE OF CHARGE DOESN'T THE INCENSE SMELL DELICIOUS
THEY CAN TRAM IT HOME BUT ANTHEA WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED IT'S ALL MY FAULT SHE SAID I KNEW THE PROPER WAY TO DARN AND I DIDN'T DO IT IT'S ALL MY FAULT LET'S GO HOME AND PATCH THE CARPET WITH YOUR ETONS SOMETHING REALLY STRONG AND SEND IT TO FETCH THEM
LITTLE GIRL DON'T BE RUDE SAID MISSUS BIDDLE FLUSHING VIOLET SHE DOESN'T MEAN TO BE BUT THERE ARE SOME NICE THINGS THERE ALL THE SAME SAID CYRIL WHO SUDDENLY FELT HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS TO INFORM THE LISTENING CROWD
BUT WE LIKE THEM TO KNOW IT UNLESS WE ARE THE VERY BEST AND NOBLEST KIND OF PEOPLE AND ROBERT WAS JUST ORDINARY
BUT JANE RAN TO THE CURATE AND EMBRACED HIM SO SUDDENLY THAT HE HAD NOT TIME TO DEFEND HIMSELF YOU'RE A DEAR SHE SAID IT IS LIKE A DREAM JUST AT FIRST BUT YOU GET USED TO IT NOW DO LET US GO THERE'S A GOOD KIND HONOURABLE CLERGYMAN
THE TWO CHILDREN SUDDENLY FELT THAT EXTRAORDINARY SHRINKING FEELING THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE WHEN YOU ARE JUST GOING TO VANISH AND THE NEXT MOMENT THEY HAD VANISHED AND THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH HIS AUNTS I KNEW IT WAS A DREAM HE CRIED WILDLY I'VE HAD SOMETHING LIKE IT BEFORE
PERHAPS IT IS REAL SAID ANTHEA ONLY IT WAS COVERED UP WITH CROSSNESS AND TIREDNESS AND THINGS AND THE CARPET TOOK THEM AWAY I HOPE IT'LL KEEP THEM AWAY SAID JANE SHE ISN'T UGLY AT ALL WHEN SHE LAUGHS
HOW FAR FAIRER THAN MY TEMPLE OR HAVE I GUESSED ARIGHT HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HITHER TO LIFT UP MY HEART WITH EMOTIONS OF JOYOUS SURPRISE TELL ME MY ROBERT IS IT NOT THAT THIS THIS IS MY TRUE TEMPLE
WHEN ONE OF THE PILLOWS BURST AND THE YOUTHFUL PRINCES WERE SO COVERED WITH FEATHERS THAT THE PICTURE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN CALLED MICHAELMAS EVE OR PLUCKING THE GEESE
BUT MOTHER SAID ANTHEA WHEN MOTHER PUT DOWN THE PEN TO LICK AN ENVELOPE THE CARPET TAKES US WHEREVER WE LIKE AND I WISH IT WOULD TAKE YOU WHERE YOU COULD GET A FEW NICE EASTERN THINGS FOR MY BAZAAR SAID MOTHER
A DEEP BREATH WAS DRAWN BY HUNDREDS OF LUNGS EVERY EYE IN THE HOUSE TURNED TO THE BOX WHERE THE LUCKLESS CHILDREN CRINGED AND MOST PEOPLE HISSED OR SAID SHISH OR TURN THEM OUT
RUN AND GET OUT YOUR FROCKS THE FROCKS DID WANT IRONING WANTED IT RATHER BADLY AS IT HAPPENED FOR BEING OF TOMATO COLOURED LIBERTY SILK
AUNT SELINA LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN AT AUNT AMELIA THEN SHE SAID BOLDLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE HAVEN'T BEEN DREAMING ANYTHING YOU MUST HAVE DROPPED OFF IN YOUR CHAIR
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOOKING DOWN INTO AN ATTIC WHICH WAS ALSO A LUMBER ROOM IT HAD BOXES AND BROKEN CHAIRS OLD FENDERS AND PICTURE FRAMES AND RAG BAGS HANGING FROM NAILS
IT FLUTTERED OFF AND THEN SOME ONE SAID IN THE OTHER EAR THEY'RE SAFE AT HOME AND WHEN I TURNED AGAIN TO SEE WHO IT WAS SPEAKING HANGED IF THERE WASN'T THAT CONFOUNDED PIGEON ON MY OTHER SHOULDER DAZED BY THE FIRE I SUPPOSE
ONLY THE FABRIC OF THE OLD CARPET WAS LEFT AND THAT WAS FULL OF HOLES COME SAID THE PHOENIX I'M COOL NOW THE FOUR CHILDREN GOT ON TO WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CARPET
YOU KNOW HOW IT CARRIED YOU OVER TO THE ISLAND AND YOU HAD TO MARRY THE BURGLAR TO THE COOK OH MY HEAD SAID THE CURATE NEVER MIND YOUR HEAD JUST NOW SAID ROBERT TRY TO BE HONEST AND HONOURABLE AND DO YOUR DUTY IN THAT STATE OF LIFE
AND INTERPRETED WHAT THE CHILDREN SAID AND WHAT THE QUEEN SAID AND WHEN THE QUEEN ASKED TO BUY THE CARPET THE CHILDREN SAID NO WHY ASKED THE RANEE AND JANE BRIEFLY SAID WHY AND THE INTERPRETER INTERPRETED THE QUEEN SPOKE AND THEN THE INTERPRETER SAID
THERE WAS ALSO CLIMBING VESUVIUS IN THIS GAME THE BABY WALKS UP YOU AND WHEN HE IS STANDING ON YOUR SHOULDERS YOU SHOUT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN WHICH IS THE RUMBLING OF THE BURNING MOUNTAIN AND THEN TUMBLE HIM GENTLY ON TO THE FLOOR
TWENTY TWO AND NINEPENCE IT OUGHT TO HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS IT'S SIMPLY DREADFUL NOW WELL NEVER MIND DARLINGS YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST I THINK WE'LL HAVE COCONUT MATTING NEXT TIME

SAY IT WAS MONEY OR PLATE OR JEWELLERY IT WOULD BE AS MUCH OURS AS ANYBODY ELSE'S MISTER VENUS RUBS AN EYEBROW INTERROGATIVELY IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT IT WOULD
HE ONLY LEARNED THAT THE MORE HE HIMSELF KNEW IN HIS LITTLE LIMITED HUMAN WAY THE BETTER HE COULD DISTANTLY IMAGINE WHAT OMNISCIENCE MIGHT KNOW
WHY WHAT TIME OF NIGHT DO YOU MEAN TO CALL IT INQUIRED FLEDGEBY TURNING AWAY BENEATH THE CLOTHES AND PRESENTING A COMFORTABLE RAMPART OF SHOULDER TO THE CHILLED FIGURE OF THE OLD MAN
ANNOUNCES BREAKFAST DINING ROOM NO LESS MAGNIFICENT THAN DRAWING ROOM TABLES SUPERB ALL THE CAMELS OUT AND ALL LADEN SPLENDID CAKE COVERED WITH CUPIDS SILVER AND TRUE LOVERS KNOTS
HE CAN SWIM CAN THIS MAN AND INSTANTLY HE STRIKES OUT
MORTIMER YOU WRETCH SAYS LADY TIPPINS TURNING THE EYEGLASS ABOUT AND ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR CHARGE THE BRIDEGROOM
THEY BURN SHERRY VERY WELL HERE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AS A PIECE OF LOCAL INTELLIGENCE PERHAPS YOU GENTLEMEN MIGHT LIKE A BOTTLE THE ANSWER BEING BY ALL MEANS
IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID MORTIMER BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A SOLICITOR IN THE FAMILY AND WE HAVE GOT A PRECIOUS ONE THERE ARE FOUR OF US WITH OUR NAMES PAINTED ON A DOOR POST IN RIGHT OF ONE BLACK HOLE CALLED A SET OF CHAMBERS SAID EUGENE
BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH UPON MYSELF WHEN I HAVE RESPECTED FAMILY FRIENDS TO REMEMBER SECONDLY
AND TURNS UPON HIM DON'T PUT IT UPON ME SIR I ASK YOU DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MISTER LAMMLE FALLS SILENT AGAIN AND THEY WALK AS BEFORE MISSUS LAMMLE OPENS HER NOSTRILS AND BITES HER UNDER LIP
MAKING A DESK OF IT HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS BACK TO THE OLD MAN WARMING HIS KNEES PERUSING THE LIST AT HIS LEISURE AND OFTEN RETURNING TO SOME LINES OF IT AS THOUGH THEY WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
WHEW WHISTLED FLEDGEBY AS HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND QUEER STREET IS FULL OF LODGERS JUST AT PRESENT THESE ARE TO BE DISPOSED OF IN PARCELS ARE THEY IN PARCELS AS SET FORTH RETURNED THE OLD MAN LOOKING OVER HIS MASTER'S SHOULDER
WHETHER IN THAT SHABBY ROOK'S NEST HE IS ALWAYS PLOTTING WISDOM OR PLOTTING MURDER WHETHER HE WILL GROW UP AFTER SO MUCH SOLITARY BROODING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS FELLOW CREATURES OR TO POISON THEM IS THE ONLY SPECK OF INTEREST THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY PROFESSIONAL VIEW
AND YOU'RE NATURALLY OF A POLITE DISPOSITION YOU ARE THIS LAST CLAUSE AS A SOFTENING COMPLIMENT TO MISTER VENUS IT IS TRUE SIR REPLIES VENUS WINKING HIS WEAK EYES AND RUNNING HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS DUSTY SHOCK OF HAIR THAT I WAS SO BEFORE A CERTAIN OBSERVATION SOURED ME
NO SAID MISTER WEGG WHO WAS GROWING RESTIVE UNDER THIS EXAMINATION I NEVER DID HEAR OF THE NAME OF BOFFIN DO YOU LIKE IT WHY NO
OLD REMEMBRANCES OF WHAT SIR MISTER VENUS BEGINS DREARILY REPLYING
A MARRIAGE CONTRACT THERE IS EXCITEMENT IN THE VENEERING MANSION THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IS GOING TO BE MARRIED POWDER AND ALL TO THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND SHE IS TO BE MARRIED FROM THE VENEERING HOUSE AND THE VENEERINGS ARE TO GIVE THE BREAKFAST
BOOK THE THIRD A LONG LANE CHAPTER ONE LODGERS IN QUEER STREET IT WAS A FOGGY DAY IN LONDON AND THE FOG WAS HEAVY AND DARK
EUGENE SAID LIGHTWOOD AND WAS ABOUT TO ADD WE MAY WAIT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHEN TURNING HIS HEAD HE FOUND THAT NO EUGENE WAS THERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND CALLED EUGENE HOLLOA BUT NO EUGENE REPLIED
HOW ARE THE TWO POOR LITTLE MINDERS ASKED MISSUS BOFFIN STRIKING RIGHT OUT MUM AND COMING ROUND BEAUTIFUL
HELD HIS PEACE INDEED THE REVEREND FRANK MILVEY WAS A FORBEARING MAN WHO NOTICED MANY SAD WARPS AND BLIGHTS IN THE VINEYARD WHEREIN HE WORKED AND DID NOT PROFESS THAT THEY MADE HIM SAVAGELY WISE
THEY PRETTY WELL PAPERS THE ROOM YOU SEE BUT I KNOW EM ALL I'M SCHOLAR ENOUGH HE WAVED THE LIGHT OVER THE WHOLE AS IF TO TYPIFY THE LIGHT OF HIS SCHOLARLY INTELLIGENCE AND THEN PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND STOOD BEHIND IT LOOKING INTENTLY AT HIS VISITORS
AND SEEING HIM POSTED IN THE BILL OF THE NIGHT I ATTENDED THE PERFORMANCE HIS FIRST SCENE WAS EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL BUT AS IT OCCUPIED A SECOND IN ITS REPRESENTATION AND FIVE LINES IN THE BILL IT SCARCELY AFFORDED GROUND FOR A COOL AND DELIBERATE JUDGMENT OF HIS POWERS
STARING IF I DIDN'T WHY SHOULD I TAKE THE TROUBLE TO COME HERE FINALLY I WAS SWORN AND GAVE MY AGREEABLE EVIDENCE IN DETAIL AND WHITE RIDING HOOD WAS FINED TEN SHILLINGS UNDER THE CLAUSE
FOR USING BAD LANGUAGE IN THE STREETS HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A CHARGE I HAD WOULD HE TAKE MY WORD THAT HE SHOULD GET INTO NO TROUBLE YES
AND FORCES HIM TO NEGLECT WORK FOR HIM AND KEEPS HIM UNDER RIGID COERCION I ONCE KNEW A FANCY TERRIER WHO KEPT A GENTLEMAN
AS IF HE HAD BEEN TO THE NEAREST WINE VAULTS AND GOT DRUNK DONKEYS AGAIN I KNOW SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS WHERE THE DONKEY GOES IN AT THE STREET DOOR AND APPEARS TO LIVE UP STAIRS FOR I HAVE EXAMINED THE BACK YARD FROM OVER THE PALINGS AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE HIM OUT
IS IT WORSE TO GO TO SEE SAINT GHASTLY GRIM BY THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHTNING I REPAIRED TO THE SAINT IN A HACKNEY CAB AND FOUND THE SKULLS MOST EFFECTIVE HAVING THE AIR OF A PUBLIC EXECUTION AND
NOTORIOUSLY HAVING NO OTHER CALLING THAN THAT OF RUFFIAN AND OF DISQUIETING AND DESPOILING ME AS I GO PEACEFULLY ABOUT MY LAWFUL BUSINESS INTERFERING WITH NO ONE THEN THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH I HAVE THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE
TO TRY MY HAND AS PROSECUTOR THE OCCASION AROSE SOON ENOUGH AND I RAN THE FOLLOWING GAUNTLET THE UTTERER OF THE BASE COIN IN QUESTION WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN WHO WITH A SUITABLE ATTENDANCE
LYING BETWEEN GRACECHURCH STREET AND THE TOWER CAPABLE OF YIELDING SAY AN APRONFUL OF HAY BY WHAT MEANS THE OLD OLD MAN AND WOMAN HAD GOT INTO IT WITH AN ALMOST TOOTHLESS HAY MAKING RAKE
IS IT POSSIBLE WHAT A WONDERFUL POLICE HERE IS A STRAIGHT BROAD PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE OF IMMENSE RESORT HALF A MILE LONG GAS LIGHTED BY NIGHT WITH A GREAT
ON THE TRAIL OF THE MURDERER AND THERE TO FLY AT THE MURDERER WHEN HE FOUND HIM RESTING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE WITH HIS VICTIM BOUND READY FOR SLAUGHTER IT WAS A HOT NIGHT AND HE CAME INTO THE FOREST FROM AN ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED DIRECTION IN THE SWEETEST TEMPER
OR IN SLEEVED WAISTCOATS AND FUR CAPS WHICH THEY CANNOT BE PERSUADED BY THE RESPECTABLE ORDERS OF SOCIETY TO UNDERTAKE IN A DIRTY COURT IN SPITALFIELDS ONCE I FOUND A GOLDFINCH DRAWING HIS OWN WATER
RIDING HOOD AND I SEEMED TO REMIND THE SYMPATHISING CHIMNEY SWEEP BY WHOM SHE WAS ATTENDED OF THE WOLF THE MAGISTRATE WAS DOUBTFUL MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER WHETHER THIS CHARGE COULD BE ENTERTAINED IT WAS NOT KNOWN
THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HIM ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIFFICULTY CAUSED BY THIS FAILING HAVING BEEN LEFT ALONE WITH THE CART OF PERIWINKLES AND FORGOTTEN HE WENT OFF IDLING
AND A KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS THAT HAS LEFT HIS LOUT OF A MAN VERY VERY FAR BEHIND AS THE DOGS OF SHY NEIGHBOURHOODS USUALLY BETRAY A SLINKING CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IN POOR CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE MOST PART MANIFESTED IN AN ASPECT OF ANXIETY AN AWKWARDNESS IN THEIR PLAY
AND HE TAKES THE BOYS OUT ON SPORTING PRETENCES INTO ALL SORTS OF SUBURBAN FIELDS HE HAS LIKEWISE MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT HE POSSESSES SOME MYSTERIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF FISHING AND THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES INCOMPLETELY EQUIPPED FOR THE HAMPSTEAD PONDS WITH A PICKLE JAR AND WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE
HE PROWLED AMONG HIS USUAL LOW HAUNTS FOR SOME TIME GRATIFYING HIS DEPRAVED TASTES UNTIL NOT TAKING THE CART INTO HIS CALCULATIONS HE ENDEAVOURED TO TURN UP A NARROW ALLEY AND BECAME GREATLY INVOLVED
MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER REPLIED THAT HE WISHED IT WERE BETTER KNOWN AND THAT IF HE COULD AFFORD THE LEISURE HE WOULD USE HIS ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE IT SO THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HOWEVER HE CONTENDED HERE WAS THE CLAUSE
UPON THE WEEDY EARTH SOMETIMES THERE IS A RUSTY PUMP SOMEWHERE NEAR AND AS I LOOK IN AT THE RAILS AND MEDITATE I HEAR IT WORKING UNDER AN UNKNOWN HAND WITH A CREAKING PROTEST
SKYLARKING AMONG THEMSELVES MY PURSE OR SHIRT PIN IS IN PREDESTINED PERIL FROM HIS PLAYFULNESS ALWAYS A RUFFIAN ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A THIEF ALWAYS A RUFFIAN NOW WHEN I
FOR THEN THE RETIRED SPOTS THAT I LOVE TO HAUNT ARE AT THEIR IDLEST AND DULLEST A GENTLE FALL OF RAIN IS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AND A WARM MIST SETS OFF MY FAVOURITE RETREATS TO DECIDED ADVANTAGE
DOZING HEAVILY AND DREAMING CONSTANTLY IT WAS ONLY WHEN I MADE A STUMBLE LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN OR STRUCK OUT INTO THE ROAD TO AVOID A HORSEMAN CLOSE UPON ME ON THE PATH WHO HAD NO EXISTENCE THAT I CAME TO MYSELF AND LOOKED ABOUT THE DAY BROKE MISTILY
THE RESULTS THAT HAVE ATTENDED IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE COME TO PASS WHO WILL SAY THAT UNDER A GOOD SYSTEM OUR STREETS COULD HAVE GOT INTO THEIR PRESENT STATE THE OBJECTION TO THE WHOLE POLICE SYSTEM AS CONCERNING THE RUFFIAN
AMONG THESE CITY CHURCHYARDS HOLD A HIGH PLACE SUCH STRANGE CHURCHYARDS HIDE IN THE CITY OF LONDON CHURCHYARDS SOMETIMES SO ENTIRELY DETACHED FROM CHURCHES ALWAYS SO PRESSED UPON
A BLACKGUARD I NEVER SAW EXCEEDED IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT A FLARING CANDLE IN A PAPER SHADE STUCK IN AMONG HIS PERIWINKLES SHOWED HIM WITH HIS RAGGED HARNESS BROKEN AND HIS CART EXTENSIVELY SHATTERED TWITCHING HIS MOUTH AND SHAKING HIS HANGING HEAD A PICTURE OF DISGRACE AND OBDURACY
AND DRAWING AS MUCH OF IT AS IF HE WERE IN A CONSUMING FEVER THAT GOLDFINCH LIVED AT A BIRD SHOP AND OFFERED IN WRITING TO BARTER HIMSELF AGAINST OLD CLOTHES EMPTY BOTTLES OR EVEN KITCHEN STUFF SURELY A LOW THING AND A DEPRAVED TASTE IN ANY FINCH
THIS SLEEPY NOTION WAS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN SUCH SUBSTANTIAL OBJECTS AS VILLAGES AND HAYSTACKS THAT AFTER THE SUN WAS UP AND BRIGHT
THE CLAUSE WAS HANDED IN AND MORE CONFERENCE RESULTED AFTER WHICH I WAS ASKED THE EXTRAORDINARY QUESTION MISTER UNCOMMERCIAL DO YOU REALLY WISH THIS GIRL TO BE SENT TO PRISON TO WHICH I GRIMLY ANSWERED
WHY IS A NOTORIOUS THIEF AND RUFFIAN EVER LEFT AT LARGE HE NEVER TURNS HIS LIBERTY TO ANY ACCOUNT BUT VIOLENCE AND PLUNDER HE NEVER DID A DAY'S WORK
ON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE TO ANOTHER YOUNG RUFFIAN WHO IN FULL DAYLIGHT EARLY ON A SUMMER EVENING HAD NEARLY THROWN A MODEST YOUNG WOMAN INTO A SWOON OF INDIGNATION AND CONFUSION BY HIS SHAMEFUL MANNER
WHO AM NOT PAID TO KNOW THESE THINGS KNOW THEM DAILY ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES AND EXPERIENCE WHEN I KNOW THAT THE RUFFIAN NEVER JOSTLES A LADY IN THE STREETS OR KNOCKS A HAT OFF BUT IN ORDER THAT THE THIEF MAY PROFIT
BY THE SILENT ELOQUENCE OF A VILLAGE CHURCH THE HUMBLE HOMES OF ENGLAND WITH THEIR DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND HONEYSUCKLE PORCHES URGE BOTH HEROES TO GO IN AND WIN AND THE LARK AND OTHER SINGING BIRDS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE UPPER AIR ECSTATICALLY CAROLLING THEIR THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR A FIGHT
AND ULTIMATELY THIS BEFELL THEY HAD LEFT THE CHURCH DOOR OPEN IN THEIR DUSTING AND ARRANGING WALKING IN TO LOOK AT THE CHURCH I BECAME AWARE BY THE DIM LIGHT OF HIM IN THE PULPIT OF HER IN THE READING DESK
THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT IN A SHY NEIGHBOURHOOD
DEAL REASONABLY WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER HIM THE POLICE DEAL WITH SO INEFFICIENTLY AND ABSURDLY THAT HE FLOURISHES AND MULTIPLIES AND WITH ALL HIS EVIL DEEDS UPON HIS HEAD AS NOTORIOUSLY AS HIS HAT IS
TREMENDOUS PROOF OF THE VIGOUR OF THAT IMMORTAL ARTICLE FOR THEY WERE IN THE GRACEFUL UNIFORM UNDER WHICH ENGLISH CHARITY DELIGHTS TO HIDE HERSELF AND THEY WERE OVERGROWN AND THEIR LEGS HIS LEGS AT LEAST
YOU MAY HEAR THEM IF YOU ARE LOOKING IN THROUGH THE IRON RAILS WHICH YOU NEVER ARE WHEN I AM TOASTING THEIR OWN WORSHIPFUL PROSPERITY SOMETIMES A WHOLESALE HOUSE OF BUSINESS
IS THE FANCY OF A HUMBLE ARTIST AS EXEMPLIFIED IN TWO PORTRAITS REPRESENTING MISTER THOMAS SAYERS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND MISTER JOHN HEENAN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THESE ILLUSTRIOUS MEN ARE HIGHLY COLOURED IN FIGHTING TRIM AND FIGHTING ATTITUDE
AS TO HIS CLOTHES OF BETTING MAN AND FIGHTING MAN IS WHISKERED HAS A STARING PIN IN HIS BREAST ALONG WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HAS INSOLENT AND CRUEL EYES LARGE SHOULDERS STRONG LEGS
I HAVE ESTABLISHED IT AS A CERTAIN FACT THAT THEY ALWAYS BEGIN TO CROW WHEN THE PUBLIC HOUSE SHUTTERS BEGIN TO BE TAKEN DOWN
MY LAST SPECIAL FEAT WAS TURNING OUT OF BED AT TWO AFTER A HARD DAY
I HAVE KNOWN A DONKEY BY SIGHT WE WERE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS WHO LIVED OVER ON THE SURREY SIDE OF LONDON BRIDGE AMONG THE FASTNESSES OF JACOB'S ISLAND AND DOCKHEAD IT WAS THE HABIT OF THAT ANIMAL WHEN HIS SERVICES WERE NOT IN IMMEDIATE REQUISITION
FOR HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE NOT ROUGHENED BY WORK AND THAT THEY TELL A TALE HENCE WHENEVER HE TAKES ONE OUT TO DRAW A SLEEVE ACROSS HIS NOSE WHICH IS OFTEN FOR HE HAS WEAK EYES
WHO TAKES HIS WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT OF WIVES IN SINGLE FILE
BY HOUSES SO SMALL SO RANK SO SILENT SO FORGOTTEN EXCEPT BY THE FEW PEOPLE WHO EVER LOOK DOWN INTO THEM FROM THEIR SMOKY WINDOWS AS I STAND
SEEMING AS THE LIGHTNING FLASHED TO WINK AND GRIN WITH THE PAIN OF THE SPIKES HAVING NO OTHER PERSON TO WHOM TO IMPART MY SATISFACTION I COMMUNICATED IT TO THE DRIVER SO FAR FROM BEING RESPONSIVE
THE SHOW WAS PITCHED TOBY RETIRED BEHIND THE DRAPERY THE AUDIENCE FORMED THE DRUM AND PIPES STRUCK UP MY COUNTRY DOG REMAINED IMMOVABLE INTENTLY STARING AT THESE STRANGE APPEARANCES UNTIL TOBY OPENED THE DRAMA BY APPEARING ON HIS LEDGE
OLD CRAZY STACKS OF CHIMNEYS SEEM TO LOOK DOWN AS THEY OVERHANG DUBIOUSLY CALCULATING HOW FAR THEY WILL HAVE TO FALL IN AN ANGLE OF THE WALLS WHAT WAS ONCE THE TOOL HOUSE OF THE GRAVE DIGGER ROTS AWAY
AMIABLE HORSE PLAY AND A GRACIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR LIFE AND LIMB ALL THIS IS CHRONICLED AS IF HE WERE AN INSTITUTION IS THERE ANY CITY IN EUROPE OUT OF ENGLAND IN WHICH THESE TERMS ARE HELD
WHEN AN OBESE FORM STOOD IN THE PORTAL PUFFILY DEMANDING JOSEPH OR IN DEFAULT OF JOSEPH CELIA TAKING THIS MONSTER BY THE SLEEVE AND LURING HIM FORTH ON PRETENCE OF SHOWING HIM WHOM HE SOUGHT
THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I LOOKED ON UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM THE OLD WOMAN WAS MUCH TOO BRIGHT FOR A PEW OPENER THE OLD MAN MUCH TOO MEEK FOR A BEADLE
BY THEMSELVES PERHAPS THEY WERE SPECTRES AND I WANTED A MEDIUM IN ANOTHER CITY CHURCHYARD OF SIMILAR CRAMPED DIMENSIONS I SAW THAT SELFSAME SUMMER TWO COMFORTABLE CHARITY CHILDREN THEY WERE MAKING LOVE
IT WAS PLAIN AND I ENGAGED TO WAIT UPON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE TO MORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I PUT MY POLICE ACT IN MY POCKET AGAIN AND WAITED ON THE SUBURBAN MAGISTRATE I WAS NOT QUITE SO COURTEOUSLY RECEIVED BY HIM
SOME TIME SINCE AWAKENED A LITTLE PLEASANTRY BY WRITING OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE OF THE RUFFIAN OF THE STREETS I HAVE SEEN THE RUFFIAN ACT IN EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH MISTER CARLYLE'S DESCRIPTION INNUMERABLE TIMES
AND IT IS HIS ONLY TRADE BY SUPERIOR FORCE AND BY VIOLENCE TO DEFY IT MOREOVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY ADMONISHED FROM HIGH PLACES LIKE SO MANY SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN OUT FOR A HOLIDAY OF BUNS AND MILK AND WATER
RESIDE IN THE DENSEST PART OF BETHNAL GREEN THEIR ABSTRACTION FROM THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY LIVE OR RATHER THEIR CONVICTION THAT THOSE OBJECTS HAVE ALL COME INTO EXISTENCE IN EXPRESS SUBSERVIENCE TO FOWLS HAS SO ENCHANTED ME THAT I HAVE MADE THEM THE SUBJECT OF MANY JOURNEYS AT DIVERS HOURS
OF ATTACKING HER WITH THIS CRY AS SHE HARMLESSLY PASSED ALONG BEFORE ME
SO HE TOOK THE GIRL AND I WENT HOME FOR MY POLICE ACT WITH THIS POTENT INSTRUMENT IN MY POCKET I LITERALLY AS WELL AS FIGURATIVELY RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE POLICE STATION
OF BLACKGUARDS YOUTHS AND BOYS WAS FLAUNTING ALONG THE STREETS RETURNING FROM AN IRISH FUNERAL IN A PROGRESS INTERSPERSED WITH SINGING AND DANCING SHE HAD TURNED ROUND TO ME AND EXPRESSED HERSELF IN THE MOST AUDIBLE MANNER
AND NOT THE DROVER WHO KEPT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY PROVED BY HIS WAY OF TAKING UNDIVIDED CHARGE OF THE SIX SHEEP WHEN THE DROVER CAME OUT BESMEARED WITH RED OCHRE AND BEER AND GAVE HIM WRONG DIRECTIONS WHICH HE CALMLY DISREGARDED
OF A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE LOMBARDY POPLAR OR PLANE TREE THAT WAS ONCE A DRYSALTER'S DAUGHTER AND SEVERAL COMMON COUNCILMEN HAS WITHERED LIKE THOSE WORTHIES AND ITS DEPARTED LEAVES ARE DUST BENEATH IT
TOUCHING WHAT MEN IN GENERAL CALL IT I HAVE NO INFORMATION IT LIES AT THE HEART OF THE CITY AND THE BLACKWALL RAILWAY SHRIEKS AT IT DAILY IT IS A SMALL SMALL CHURCHYARD WITH A FEROCIOUS
WALKS UP AND DOWN ENCOURAGING HER AND DEFYING THE UNIVERSE BUT THE FAMILY I HAVE BEEN BEST ACQUAINTED WITH
TO THE CONSTABLE ITS MALE MEMBERS INSTANTLY TOOK TO THEIR HEELS LEAVING THE GIRL ALONE I ASKED THE CONSTABLE DID HE KNOW MY NAME YES HE DID TAKE THAT GIRL INTO CUSTODY ON MY CHARGE
BRICKMAKERS WOOD SAWYERS COSTERMONGERS THESE CLASSES ARE OFTEN DISORDERLY AND TROUBLESOME BUT IT IS MOSTLY AMONG THEMSELVES AND AT ANY RATE THEY HAVE THEIR INDUSTRIOUS AVOCATIONS
AND LAYING GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT THAT HE WAS THIRTY LEAGUES AWAY THE FAITHFUL DOG WAS BARKING FURIOUSLY IN THE PROMPTER'S BOX AND CLEARLY CHOKING HIMSELF AGAINST HIS COLLAR BUT IT WAS IN HIS GREATEST SCENE OF ALL THAT HIS HONESTY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM HE HAD TO ENTER A DENSE AND TRACKLESS FOREST
OR ESSAYED TO TOMAHAWK A BRITISH OFFICER
ON AN OLD TOMBSTONE IN THE FOREGROUND BETWEEN ME AND THEM WERE TWO CHERUBIM BUT FOR THOSE CELESTIAL EMBELLISHMENTS BEING REPRESENTED AS HAVING NO POSSIBLE USE FOR KNEE BREECHES STOCKINGS OR MITTENS
OF THE DISTRICT THERE I FOUND ON DUTY A VERY INTELLIGENT INSPECTOR THEY ARE ALL INTELLIGENT MEN WHO LIKEWISE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A CHARGE I SHOWED HIM MY CLAUSE
AS TAKING A DIFFERENT VIEW OF WORMS FROM THAT ENTERTAINED BY HUMANITY BUT THEY ARE FLAT AND HOARSE OF VOICE LIKE THE CLERK THE ORGAN
UNLESS HE IS WITH THEM AND BARKING TREMENDOUSLY
HE SURVEYED ME HE WAS NATURALLY A BOTTLED NOSED RED FACED MAN WITH A BLANCHED COUNTENANCE AND AS HE DROVE ME BACK HE EVER AND AGAIN GLANCED IN OVER HIS SHOULDER THROUGH THE LITTLE FRONT WINDOW OF HIS CARRIAGE
REPULSIVE WRETCHES INSIDE AND OUT IN ALL THE PARTY THERE OBTAINS A CERTAIN TWITCHING CHARACTER OF MOUTH AND FURTIVENESS OF EYE THAT HINT HOW THE COWARD IS LURKING UNDER THE BULLY THE HINT IS QUITE CORRECT
THE MERCHANT WAS A BOW LEGGED CHARACTER WITH A FLAT AND CUSHIONY NOSE LIKE THE LAST NEW STRAWBERRY HE WORE A FUR CAP AND SHORTS AND WAS OF THE VELVETEEN RACE VELVETEENY HE SENT WORD THAT HE WOULD LOOK ROUND
ON A SLOPING STONE THERE AND COMPARE NOTES THEIR DOGS MAY ALWAYS BE OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME OPENLY DISPARAGING THE MEN THEY KEEP TO ONE ANOTHER AND SETTLING WHERE THEY SHALL RESPECTIVELY TAKE THEIR MEN WHEN THEY BEGIN TO MOVE AGAIN AT A SMALL BUTCHER'S IN A SHY NEIGHBOURHOOD
OR SENT TO PRISON FOR SO MANY DAYS WHY LORD BLESS YOU SIR SAID THE POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOWED ME OUT WITH A GREAT ENJOYMENT OF THE JEST OF HER HAVING BEEN GOT UP SO EFFECTIVELY AND CAUSED SO MUCH HESITATION
FOR THEY ARE A SLINKING SNEAKING SET FAR MORE PRONE TO LIE DOWN ON THEIR BACKS AND KICK OUT WHEN IN DIFFICULTY THAN TO MAKE A STAND FOR IT THIS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE STREET MUD ON THE BACKS OF NUMBERS FIVE
THAT WHERESOEVER THERE IS COLLECTED TOGETHER ANY FAIR GENERAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE A RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER AND A DETERMINATION TO DISCOUNTENANCE LAWLESSNESS AND DISORDER MAY BE RELIED UPON AS TO ONE ANOTHER
MY WALKING IS OF TWO KINDS ONE STRAIGHT ON END TO A DEFINITE GOAL AT A ROUND PACE ONE OBJECTLESS LOITERING AND PURELY VAGABOND IN THE LATTER STATE NO GIPSY ON EARTH IS A GREATER VAGABOND THAN MYSELF
I SHOULD HAVE COMPARED THEM WITH THE HAY MAKERS AND SOUGHT A LIKENESS I COUGHED
AS MISTRUSTING THAT I WAS A FARE ORIGINALLY FROM A GRAVE IN THE CHURCHYARD OF SAINT GHASTLY GRIM WHO MIGHT HAVE FLITTED HOME AGAIN WITHOUT PAYING SOMETIMES THE QUEER HALL OF SOME QUEER COMPANY
WHEN HE COMES OUT HE IS SURELY AS NOTORIOUS A THIEF AS HE WAS WHEN HE WENT IN THEN SEND HIM BACK AGAIN JUST HEAVEN CRIES THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION
AND ON THE DENSELY CROWDED STATE OF ALL THE AVENUES TO CAT'S MEAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A MORAL AND POLITICO ECONOMICAL HAGGARDNESS IN THEM TRACEABLE TO THESE REFLECTIONS BUT THEY EVINCE A PHYSICAL DETERIORATION
HAS AN IDEA OF ENTRUSTING AN EGG TO THAT PARTICULAR DENOMINATION OR MERELY UNDERSTANDS THAT SHE HAS NO BUSINESS IN THE BUILDING AND IS CONSEQUENTLY FRANTIC TO ENTER IT I CANNOT DETERMINE BUT SHE IS CONSTANTLY ENDEAVOURING TO UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPAL DOOR WHILE HER PARTNER WHO IS INFIRM UPON HIS LEGS
THEY WHO COMPOSED THE OUTER CIRCLE OF FACES WERE ON TIPTOE TO GAZE AND EVEN THE CULPRIT FOR AN INSTANT FORGOT HIS SHAME IN A DEEPER EMOTION AND EXPOSED HIS ABJECT FEATURES IN ORDER TO CAST AN ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED GLANCE AT THE DARK ASSEMBLAGE OF CHIEFS
THIS FACT WAS DOUBLY APPARENT BY THE RAPID MANNER IN WHICH THE BATTLE IN THE FOREST ROLLED UPWARD TOWARD THE VILLAGE AND BY AN INSTANT FALLING OFF IN THE NUMBER OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WHO RUSHED TO ASSIST IN MAINTAINING THE FRONT AND AS IT NOW PROVED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL POINT OF DEFENSE
HE WILL EVEN CONVEY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICATIONS BY THE SIMPLEST INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE PHILOLOGISTS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE BUT TWO OR THREE LANGUAGES PROPERLY SPEAKING
AND ENTERED UNDER THE HIGH BUT DARK ARCHES OF THE FOREST HERE THEIR PROGRESS WAS LESS INTERRUPTED AND THE INSTANT THE GUIDE PERCEIVED THAT THE FEMALES COULD COMMAND THEIR STEEDS HE MOVED ON AT A PACE BETWEEN A TROT AND A WALK
GRAVELY AWAITING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THOSE WHO HAD UNEXPECTEDLY COME AMONG THEM DAVID IN SOME MEASURE FAMILIARIZED TO THE SCENE LED THE WAY WITH A STEADINESS THAT NO SLIGHT OBSTACLE WAS LIKELY TO DISCONCERT INTO THIS VERY BUILDING
WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER HIS PERSON THE RIFLE OF HAWKEYE WAS RAISED BUT A ROCK WHICH FELL ON THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE FUGITIVES BELOW EXPOSED THE INDIGNANT AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE OF THE HONEST GAMUT
SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
NO HONEST MAN WILL DENY IT SAID THE SCOUT A LITTLE NETTLED AT THE IMPLIED DISTRUST OF HIS EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY OF THE TIDES AND I GRANT THAT IT IS TRUE ON THE SMALL SCALE AND WHERE THE LAND IS LEVEL
WHERE THE LIE CAN BE GIVEN TO THE FACE OF A COWARDLY BOASTER
LISTEN HAWKEYE AND YOUR EAR SHALL DRINK NO LIE TIS WHAT MY FATHERS HAVE SAID AND WHAT THE MOHICANS HAVE DONE HE HESITATED A SINGLE INSTANT
DELAWARES WAPANACHKI AND MOHICANS ALL MEAN THE SAME PEOPLE OR TRIBES OF THE SAME STOCK
PROHIBITED A MORE OPEN EXPRESSION OF HIS ADMIRATION OF A WITTICISM THAT WAS PERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO HIS HEARERS HE CONTINUED IT IS NOT PRUDENT FOR ANY ONE OF MY PROFESSION TO BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THOSE HE HAS TO INSTRUCT
GOOD COMPANY WOULD SEEM CONSISTENT TO THE WISHES OF BOTH PARTIES YOU APPEAR TO POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OF A CASTING VOTE RETURNED HEYWARD WE ARE THREE WHILE YOU HAVE CONSULTED NO ONE BUT YOURSELF EVEN SO THE FIRST POINT TO BE OBTAINED
THE ONSET AND THE ISSUE WERE LIKE THE PASSAGE AND DESTRUCTION OF A WHIRLWIND THE TOMAHAWK OF UNCAS THE BLOWS OF HAWKEYE AND EVEN THE STILL NERVOUS ARM OF MUNRO WERE ALL BUSY FOR THAT PASSING MOMENT
WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TOWARD THE SOLITARY HURON BUT WITHOUT DEIGNING TO BESTOW ANY OTHER NOTICE ON SO UNWORTHY AN OBJECT THE WORDS OF THE ANSWER AND THE AIR OF THE SPEAKER PRODUCED A STRONG SENSATION AMONG HIS AUDITORS
AND EVERY FEW MINUTES THE BAND CAME TO A HALT AND LISTENED FOR HOSTILE SOUNDS WITH AN ACUTENESS OF ORGANS THAT WOULD BE SCARCELY CONCEIVABLE TO A MAN IN A LESS NATURAL STATE THEIR MARCH WAS HOWEVER UNMOLESTED
A SINGLE BOUND WOULD CARRY HIM TO THE BROW OF THE PRECIPICE AND ASSURE HIS SAFETY
I SHOULD THINK A RIFLE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR GRANDFATHERS WAS NOT SO DANGEROUS AS A HICKORY BOW AND A GOOD FLINT HEAD MIGHT BE IF DRAWN WITH INDIAN JUDGMENT AND SENT BY AN INDIAN EYE
IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
HAWKEYE WHO COMPREHENDED THEIR MEANING GLANCES TURNED AND PERCEIVED THAT HIS PARTY HAD BEEN FOLLOWED THUS FAR BY THE SINGING MASTER DO YOU KNOW FRIEND ASKED THE SCOUT GRAVELY AND PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE OF THE PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS DESERVING IN HIS MANNER
DELAWARE HE SAID THOUGH ONE OF A NATION OF WOMEN YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF A MAN I WOULD GIVE YOU FOOD BUT HE WHO EATS WITH A HURON SHOULD BECOME HIS FRIEND
ANIMATING HIS FOLLOWERS BY HIS VOICE AND HIS OWN EXAMPLE HAWKEYE THEN GAVE THE WORD TO BEAR DOWN UPON THEIR FOES
LEAVING THE PLACE BENEATH CLEAR OF ITS FUMES
THOUGH IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE GOVERNED BY VERY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS WHILE ONE STOOD ERECT AND FIRM PREPARED TO MEET HIS FATE LIKE A HERO THE OTHER BOWED HIS HEAD AS IF PALSIED BY TERROR OR STRICKEN WITH SHAME
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THEY ARE NOW SO DISTINCT IN THEIR WORDS AS TO POSSESS MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF STRANGE LANGUAGES HENCE MUCH OF THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT HAS ARISEN IN LEARNING THEIR HISTORIES
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE COUNCIL LODGE RESOLVED TO SEEK AND QUESTION DAVID IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS DOUBTS ON REACHING THE BUILDING WHICH HAD PROVED ALIKE THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT AND THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
UNTIL THEY GAINED A POINT WHERE THE FORMER WAS CONTENT TO MAKE A HALT THE WARRIORS WHO HAD BREATHED THEMSELVES FREELY IN THE PRECEDING STRUGGLE WERE NOW POSTED ON A BIT OF LEVEL GROUND SPRINKLED WITH TREES IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO CONCEAL THEM
THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE SATISFACTION AWARE OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE DIGNITY OF HIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER HOWEVER HE REPRESSED HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH SUITABLE MYSTERY SPIRITS DIFFER
IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
HAWKEYE AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS WITHDREW A FEW PACES TO A SHELTER AND AWAITED THE ISSUE WITH CALMNESS THAT NOTHING BUT GREAT PRACTISE COULD IMPART IN SUCH A SCENE IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE REPORTS OF THE RIFLES BEGAN TO LOSE THE ECHOES OF THE WOODS AND TO SOUND LIKE WEAPONS DISCHARGED IN THE OPEN AIR
HIS FORM SHRINKING INTO A CROUCHING AND ABJECT ATTITUDE AS IF ANXIOUS TO FILL AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL HAD TAKEN HIS PROPER STATION AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE PLACE THE GRAY HAIRED CHIEF ALREADY INTRODUCED TO THE READER
WELL INFORMED OF THE APPROACH OF EVERY DANGER WHILE IT IS YET AT A DISTANCE THE INDIAN GENERALLY RESTS SECURE UNDER HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SIGNS OF THE FOREST AND THE LONG AND DIFFICULT PATHS THAT SEPARATE HIM FROM THOSE HE HAS MOST REASON TO DREAD BUT THE ENEMY WHO
NOW MADE A CLOSE AND DEADLY DISCHARGE OF THEIR PIECES AND JUSTIFIED THE APPREHENSIONS OF THE SCOUT BY FELLING THREE OF HIS FOREMOST WARRIORS BUT THE SHOCK WAS INSUFFICIENT TO REPEL THE IMPETUS OF THE CHARGE
BY FLOURISHING HIS TOMAHAWK BEFORE THEIR VICTIM AND ADDING HIS EMPTY BOASTS TO THE TAUNTS OF THE WOMEN THEN INDEED THE CAPTIVE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD THE LIGHT AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE STRIPLING WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT WAS SUPERIOR TO CONTEMPT
WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK FULLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY SINCE IT OCCURRED TO US THAT THE FRENCH NAME OF THIS LAKE WAS TOO COMPLICATED THE AMERICAN TOO COMMONPLACE AND THE INDIAN TOO UNPRONOUNCEABLE
THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY INSTANT CAUSE FOR SUCH AN APPREHENSION JUST THEN A WARRIOR FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE EXASPERATED CROWD MOTIONING THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ASIDE WITH A STERN GESTURE HE TOOK UNCAS BY THE ARM
THE EFFECT OF HIS INDIFFERENCE BEGAN TO EXTEND ITSELF TO THE OTHER SPECTATORS AND A YOUNGSTER WHO WAS JUST QUITTING THE CONDITION OF A BOY TO ENTER THE STATE OF MANHOOD ATTEMPTED TO ASSIST THE TERMAGANT
IMMEDIATELY UNDER AN OPENING THAT ADMITTED THE TWINKLING LIGHT OF ONE OR TWO STARS STOOD UNCAS CALM ELEVATED AND COLLECTED HIS HIGH AND HAUGHTY CARRIAGE WAS NOT LOST ON HIS CAPTORS WHO OFTEN BENT THEIR LOOKS ON HIS PERSON WITH EYES WHICH
FOR EITHER TO BE USED FAMILIARLY IN A WORK OF FICTION LOOKING OVER AN ANCIENT MAP IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT A TRIBE OF INDIANS CALLED LES HORICANS BY THE FRENCH
THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
AND RESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE STILL THAT BREATHING SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE DROWSY SULTRINESS OF AN AMERICAN LANDSCAPE IN JULY PERVADED THE SECLUDED SPOT INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE LOW VOICES OF THE MEN
WHICH MIGHT WITH SOME LITTLE INCONVENIENCE RECEIVE ONE PERSON AT A TIME BECAME VISIBLE HERE THEN LIES OUR WAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN IN A LOW VOICE MANIFEST NO DISTRUST OR YOU MAY INVITE THE DANGER YOU APPEAR TO APPREHEND
THE BROOK WAS IRREGULAR IN ITS WIDTH SOMETIMES SHOOTING THROUGH NARROW FISSURES IN THE ROCKS AND AT OTHERS SPREADING OVER ACRES OF BOTTOM LAND FORMING LITTLE AREAS THAT MIGHT BE TERMED PONDS
DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
THE FIGHT IS COMING UP THE ASCENT SAID DUNCAN POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF A NEW EXPLOSION OF FIREARMS WE ARE TOO MUCH IN THE CENTER OF THEIR LINE TO BE EFFECTIVE
IT WOULD SEEM LONG PRACTICE HAD RENDERED THIS MANUAL ACCOMPANIMENT NECESSARY
HE SAID IN THE FORMER LANGUAGE LOOKING ABOUT HIM FROM COUNTENANCE TO COUNTENANCE IN HOPES OF FINDING A NOD OF ASSENT THOUGH MORE THAN ONE HAD TURNED AS IF TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS THEY REMAINED UNANSWERED I SHOULD BE GRIEVED TO THINK
TEN MINUTES WHICH APPEARED SO MANY AGES TO DUNCAN MIGHT HAVE PASSED IN THIS MANNER AND THE WARRIORS WERE FAIRLY ENVELOPED IN A CLOUD OF WHITE SMOKE BEFORE ANY OF THEM SPOKE
AS MORE INTELLIGIBLE TO THE SUBJECT OF HER GIBES SHE COMMENCED ALOUD LOOK YOU DELAWARE SHE SAID SNAPPING HER FINGERS IN HIS FACE YOUR NATION IS A RACE OF WOMEN
FOR THE APPELLATION OF OUR FINEST SHEET OF WATER
ACROSS THE TRACT OF WILDERNESS WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE DELAWARES AND THE VILLAGE OF THEIR ENEMIES IT SEEMED AS IF THE FOOT OF MAN HAD NEVER TRODDEN SO BREATHING AND DEEP WAS THE SILENCE IN WHICH IT LAY BUT HAWKEYE WHOSE DUTY LED HIM FOREMOST IN THE ADVENTURE
BELIEVE ME HIS NATURAL TONES ARE BETTER FITTED FOR A MELLOW TENOR THAN THE BASS YOU HEARD IS HE THEN MUCH PRACTICED IN THE ART OF PSALMODY DEMANDED HER SIMPLE COMPANION ALICE FELT DISPOSED TO LAUGH
ENDEAVORING AT THE SAME TIME
CASTING A GLANCE AT THE DISTANT CORA
AND THE THICK SHRUBBERY WHICH SKIRTED THE STREAM NO PRECAUTION KNOWN TO AN INDIAN ATTACK WAS NEGLECTED A WARRIOR RATHER CRAWLED THAN WALKED ON EACH FLANK SO AS TO CATCH OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES INTO THE FOREST
WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE PASSING THOUGHT MAJOR HEYWARD WAS MISTAKEN ONLY IN SUFFERING HIS YOUTHFUL AND GENEROUS PRIDE TO SUPPRESS HIS ACTIVE WATCHFULNESS THE CAVALCADE HAD NOT LONG PASSED
THE PURSUERS AND PURSUED ENTERED THE WYANDOT VILLAGE WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER EXCITED BY THE PRESENCE OF THEIR DWELLINGS AND TIRED OF THE CHASE THE HURONS NOW MADE A STAND AND FOUGHT AROUND THEIR COUNCIL LODGE WITH THE FURY OF DESPAIR
BUT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON WHAT SCALE YOU LOOK AT THINGS NOW ON THE SMALL SCALE THE ARTH IS LEVEL BUT ON THE LARGE SCALE IT IS ROUND
THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
THE RED HURONS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND ASK IF ANY ARE SICK ANOTHER SILENCE SUCCEEDED THIS ANNUNCIATION OF THE CHARACTER DUNCAN HAD ASSUMED EVERY EYE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY BENT ON HIS PERSON
THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLACE IN WILD CONFUSION A DOZEN BLAZING PILES NOW SHED THEIR LURID BRIGHTNESS ON THE PLACE WHICH RESEMBLED SOME UNHALLOWED AND SUPERNATURAL ARENA
GLEAMED ON THE PERSONS OF THOSE WHOSE BREATH WAS HIS FAME AND THE LATTER EMOTION FOR AN INSTANT PREDOMINATED HE AROSE TO HIS FEET AND BARING HIS BOSOM LOOKED STEADILY ON THE KEEN GLITTERING KNIFE THAT WAS ALREADY UPHELD BY HIS INEXORABLE JUDGE
TO ALL THIS THE CAPTIVE MADE NO REPLY BUT WAS CONTENT TO PRESERVE AN ATTITUDE IN WHICH DIGNITY WAS SINGULARLY BLENDED WITH DISDAIN EXASPERATED AS MUCH BY HIS COMPOSURE AS BY HIS GOOD FORTUNE THEIR WORDS BECAME UNINTELLIGIBLE
DOES NOT THIS STREAM AT OUR FEET RUN TOWARD THE SUMMER UNTIL ITS WATERS GROW SALT AND THE CURRENT FLOWS UPWARD
THE SQUAWS SEIZED CLUBS AXES OR WHATEVER WEAPON OF OFFENSE FIRST OFFERED ITSELF TO THEIR HANDS AND RUSHED EAGERLY TO ACT THEIR PART IN THE CRUEL GAME THAT WAS AT HAND EVEN THE CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED
AND BENDING A CAUTIOUS GLANCE TOWARD HIS COMPANION HE CONTINUED IN A MANNER THAT WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN INTERROGATION AND ASSERTION
EVERYWHERE ALONG ITS BANDS WERE THE MOLDERING RELICS OF DEAD TREES IN ALL THE STAGES OF DECAY FROM THOSE THAT GROANED ON THEIR TOTTERING TRUNKS TO SUCH AS HAD RECENTLY BEEN ROBBED OF THOSE RUGGED COATS THAT SO MYSTERIOUSLY CONTAIN THEIR PRINCIPLE OF LIFE
DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
WHICH MAY POSSIBLY BE THOUGHT CORROBORATIVE OF THE MOSAIC ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION THE WHITES HAVE ASSISTED GREATLY IN RENDERING THE TRADITIONS OF THE ABORIGINES MORE OBSCURE BY THEIR OWN MANNER OF CORRUPTING NAMES
BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES THREE TIMES HAVE THEY CALLED ON YOU TO COME AND AS OFTEN DID YOU FORGET TO ANSWER YOUR NAME WILL NEVER BE MENTIONED AGAIN IN YOUR TRIBE IT IS ALREADY FORGOTTEN
AND THOUGH NOT A MAN OF WAR WITH MY LOINS GIRDED AND MY SWORD SHARPENED YET WOULD I GLADLY STRIKE A BLOW IN HER BEHALF THE SCOUT HESITATED AS IF WEIGHING THE CHANCES OF SUCH A STRANGE ENLISTMENT IN HIS MIND BEFORE HE ANSWERED
GOOD EXCLAIMED TWO OR THREE OF HIS AUDITORS AT THE SAME TIME
SUDDENLY THE MULTITUDE ROLLED BACKWARD AND APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE HE HIMSELF STOOD THE HEAVY BODY IN THE REAR PRESSED UPON THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT AND BORE THEM TO THE EARTH THE STRANGER REAPPEARED IN THE CONFUSION
BUT THEY PROVED TO BE THOSE OF A STRANGER AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE INEXPLICABLE OF ONE WHO BORE ALL THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF A HURON WARRIOR INSTEAD OF MINGLING WITH HIS TRIBE HOWEVER HE SAT APART A SOLITARY BEING IN A MULTITUDE
HE LOOKS TO SEE THAT NO ENEMIES ARE ON HIS TRAIL THE CANOE OF A DEAD WARRIOR WILL NOT FLOAT ON THE HORICAN RETURNED THE SAVAGE GLOOMILY HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THE DELAWARES
DREW HIS KNIFE AND TURNED TO HIS CAPTIVE WITH A LOOK IN WHICH CONFLICTING PASSIONS FIERCELY CONTENDED WOMAN HE SAID
I NEVER ABIDE IN ANY PLACE SLEEPING OR WAKING WITHOUT AN EXAMPLE OF THIS GIFTED WORK TIS THE SIX AND TWENTIETH EDITION PROMULGATED AT BOSTON
THAT THE DISAPPOINTED WOMEN DID NOT LAVISHLY EXPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL STRANGER THEY FLOUTED AT HIS EFFORTS AND TOLD HIM WITH BITTER SCOFFS THAT HIS FEET WERE BETTER THAN HIS HANDS AND THAT HE MERITED WINGS
FEW BIRDS HOVERED OVER THE LEAFY BOSOM OF THE VALLEY FRIGHTENED FROM THEIR SECLUDED NESTS AND HERE AND THERE A LIGHT VAPORY CLOUD WHICH SEEMED ALREADY BLENDING WITH THE ATMOSPHERE AROSE ABOVE THE TREES AND INDICATED SOME SPOT WHERE THE STRUGGLE HAD BEEN FIERCE AND STATIONARY
WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
AS THE CHIEF SLOWLY UTTERED THESE WORDS PAUSING IMPRESSIVELY BETWEEN EACH SENTENCE THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS FACE IN DEFERENCE TO THE OTHER'S RANK AND YEARS SHAME HORROR AND PRIDE STRUGGLED IN ITS LINEAMENTS HIS EYE WHICH WAS CONTRACTED WITH INWARD ANGUISH
PRESSED CLOSE UPON HIS HEELS AND WITH AN UPLIFTED ARM MENACED A FATAL BLOW DUNCAN THRUST FORTH A FOOT AND THE SHOCK PRECIPITATED THE EAGER SAVAGE HEADLONG MANY FEET IN ADVANCE OF HIS INTENDED VICTIM
THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
DURING THE TIME UNCAS WAS MAKING THIS DISPOSITION OF HIS FORCES THE WOODS WERE AS STILL AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE WHO HAD MET IN COUNCIL APPARENTLY AS MUCH UNTENANTED AS WHEN THEY CAME FRESH FROM THE HANDS OF THEIR ALMIGHTY CREATOR
AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
FOR THOUGH THE TIMES MAY CALL FOR SOME SLIGHT CHANGES YET DOES THIS VERSION WHICH WE USE IN THE COLONIES OF NEW ENGLAND SO MUCH EXCEED ALL OTHER VERSIONS THAT BY ITS RICHNESS ITS EXACTNESS AND ITS SPIRITUAL SIMPLICITY IT APPROACHETH AS NEAR
THE SNOW WAS COLOURED ONLY WHERE IT HAD THAWED VERY RAPIDLY OR HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY CRUSHED A LITTLE RUBBED ON PAPER GAVE IT A FAINT ROSE TINGE MINGLED WITH A LITTLE BRICK RED I AFTERWARDS SCRAPED SOME OFF THE PAPER AND FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF GROUPS OF LITTLE SPHERES IN COLOURLESS CASES
TO THE REST OF THE ISLAND FROM THE GREAT NUMBER OF COWS WHICH HAVE BEEN KILLED THERE IS A LARGE PROPORTION OF BULLS THESE WANDER ABOUT SINGLE OR TWO AND THREE TOGETHER AND ARE VERY SAVAGE I NEVER SAW SUCH MAGNIFICENT BEASTS
IN LIKE MANNER FALLS WITHIN AN UPPER RETURN STREAM AT FIRST IT APPEARS RATHER SURPRISING THAT THE TRADE WIND ALONG THE NORTHERN PARTS OF CHILE AND ON THE COAST OF PERU SHOULD BLOW IN SO VERY SOUTHERLY A DIRECTION AS IT DOES
ON THE BANKS OF WHICH MASSES OF HIGHLY CELLULAR SCORIAE WERE FOUND BY THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED IN THE SURVEY AS IT WAS EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN WE ARRIVED WE TOOK FRESH HORSES
THE NOISE BEING VERY PECULIAR RESEMBLING THAT OF BUBBLES OF AIR PASSING RAPIDLY FROM A SMALL ORIFICE UNDER WATER SO AS TO PRODUCE AN ACUTE SOUND ACCORDING TO AZARA THIS BIRD LIKE THE CUCKOO DEPOSITS ITS EGGS IN OTHER BIRDS NESTS
HENCE IN THESE CASES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT VOLCANOS BURST FORTH INTO ACTION AND BECOME EXTINGUISHED ON THE SAME SPOTS ACCORDINGLY AS ELEVATORY OR SUBSIDING MOVEMENTS PREVAIL THERE
IS A SINGULARLY SHY BIRD IT FREQUENTS THE MOST RETIRED THICKETS AND FEEDS ON FRUIT AND CATERPILLARS IN STRUCTURE ALSO THESE TWO GENERA ARE WIDELY REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER
WHEN ANGRY OR FRIGHTENED THEY UTTER THE TUCUTUCO OF THOSE I KEPT ALIVE SEVERAL EVEN THE FIRST DAY BECAME QUITE TAME NOT ATTEMPTING TO BITE OR TO RUN AWAY OTHERS WERE A LITTLE WILDER
THE DISTANCE IS CALLED FIFTEEN LEAGUES BUT IT IS ONLY GUESS WORK AND IS GENERALLY OVERSTATED THE ROAD WAS UNINTERESTING OVER A DRY GRASSY PLAIN
GUARDIA DEL MONTE EFFECTS OF CATTLE ON THE VEGETATION CARDOON BUENOS AYRES CORRAL WHERE CATTLE ARE SLAUGHTERED
AS TO HAVE BURIED EVERY MOUNTAIN SUMMIT OVER WIDE OCEAN SPACES NOW IN THIS MAP WE SEE THAT THE REEFS TINTED PALE AND DARK BLUE WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE SAME ORDER OF MOVEMENT AS A GENERAL RULE MANIFESTLY STAND NEAR EACH OTHER AGAIN WE SEE
THE LOWER COUNTRY CONSISTS OF CLAY SLATE AND SANDSTONE
HAVE BEEN DISLOCATED BAKED CRYSTALLIZED AND ALMOST BLENDED TOGETHER THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MOUNTAIN MASSES OF A PECULIAR WHITE SODA GRANITIC ROCK THE OTHER MAIN LINE NAMELY THAT OF THE PORTILLO IS OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FORMATION
NUMBERLESS FACTS COULD BE ADDUCED TO PROVE THAT UPRAISED ORGANIC REMAINS ARE COMMON WHEREVER THERE ARE ACTIVE VOLCANOS BUT UNTIL IT COULD BE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS OF SUBSIDENCE VOLCANOS WERE EITHER ABSENT OR INACTIVE THE INFERENCE HOWEVER PROBABLE IN ITSELF
THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE ORNAMENTED BY STREAKS OF BLACK POWDER MADE OF CHARCOAL THE PARTY ALTOGETHER CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DEVILS WHICH COME ON THE STAGE IN PLAYS LIKE DER FREISCHUTZ THEIR VERY ATTITUDES WERE ABJECT
THIS HORSE HOWEVER WAS A YOUNG ONE AND WOULD NOT STAND STILL BUT GAVE IN TO THE COW AS SHE STRUGGLED IT WAS ADMIRABLE TO SEE WITH WHAT DEXTERITY SAINT JAGO
CASUCHAS VALPARAISO
HE WAS MERRY AND OFTEN LAUGHED AND WAS REMARKABLY SYMPATHETIC WITH ANY ONE IN PAIN WHEN THE WATER WAS ROUGH I WAS OFTEN A LITTLE SEA SICK AND HE USED TO COME TO ME AND SAY IN A PLAINTIVE VOICE POOR POOR FELLOW BUT THE NOTION AFTER HIS AQUATIC LIFE
AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
WE MAY IMAGINE THAT THE WIND WHICH COMING FROM THE EASTWARD IS THUS BANKED UP BY THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS WOULD BECOME STAGNANT AND IRREGULAR IN ITS MOVEMENTS
WITHIN A VERY FEW YEARS AFTER THESE ISLANDS SHALL HAVE BECOME REGULARLY SETTLED IN ALL PROBABILITY THIS FOR WILL BE CLASSED WITH THE DODO AS AN ANIMAL WHICH HAS PERISHED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
AT NIGHT WE SLEPT AT A COTTAGE OUR MANNER OF TRAVELLING WAS DELIGHTFULLY INDEPENDENT
SIR F HEAD MARVELS HOW MINES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS
NEITHER PLANT NOR BIRD EXCEPTING A FEW CONDORS WHEELING AROUND THE HIGHER PINNACLES DISTRACTED MY ATTENTION FROM THE INANIMATE MASS I FELT GLAD THAT I WAS ALONE IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A THUNDERSTORM OR HEARING IN FULL ORCHESTRA A CHORUS OF THE MESSIAH
THESE FACTS AND SOME ANALOGOUS ONES LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ISLAND MUST LATELY HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE REEF GROWN UPWARDS HERE AGAIN EARTHQUAKES ARE FREQUENT AND VERY SEVERE IN THE SOCIETY ARCHIPELAGO ON THE OTHER HAND
CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAILED HIM IN A LOUD CLEAR VOICE TO ANCHOR WHERE HE THEN WAS
WE SLEPT WITH A PARTY OF MEN WHO WERE EMPLOYED IN LOADING MULES WITH THIS SUBSTANCE WHICH IS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF WINE WE SET OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING TWENTY FIRST AND CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THE RIVER WHICH HAD BECOME VERY SMALL
WHERE GALE SUCCEEDS GALE WITH RAIN HAIL AND SLEET SEEMS BLACKER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN LOOKING DUE SOUTHWARD FROM PORT FAMINE THE DISTANT CHANNELS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED FROM THEIR GLOOMINESS TO LEAD BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD
I SUPPOSE MY HORSE FELL AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SIX HORSES WERE FLOUNDERING IN THE MUD TOGETHER ALL THE LITTLE STREAMS ARE BORDERED BY SOFT PEAT
AND NEARLY THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH AN UNINHABITED COUNTRY WE STARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING ASCENDING A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BASIN OF GREEN TURF
THIS CHANNEL WILL BE MORE OR LESS DEEP ACCORDING TO THE RATE OF SUBSIDENCE TO THE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT ACCUMULATED IN IT AND TO THE GROWTH OF THE DELICATELY BRANCHED CORALS WHICH CAN LIVE THERE
EXTREMELY RUGGED AND BROKEN AND SO ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF TREES AND EVEN BUSHES THAT WE ACTUALLY COULD NOT MAKE A SKEWER TO STRETCH OUT OUR MEAT OVER THE FIRE OF THISTLE STALKS
THEY PUT THE RAG WITH ITS SPARK OF FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND COVERED IT UP THE NEST BEING THEN HELD UP TO THE WIND BY DEGREES IT SMOKED MORE AND MORE
AND A SOLDIER FOR A GUIDE AND STARTED FOR THE SIERRA DE LA VENTANA THIS MOUNTAIN IS VISIBLE FROM THE ANCHORAGE AT BAHIA BLANCA AND CAPTAIN FITZ ROY
A FINE MALE OSTRICH BEING TURNED BY THE HEADMOST RIDERS TRIED TO ESCAPE ON ONE SIDE THE GAUCHOS PURSUED AT A RECKLESS PACE TWISTING THEIR HORSES ABOUT WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE COMMAND
WE MAY IMAGINE THAT STREAMS OF WHITE LAVA HAD FLOWED FROM MANY PARTS OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE LOWER COUNTRY AND THAT WHEN SOLIDIFIED THEY HAD BEEN RENT BY SOME ENORMOUS CONVULSION INTO MYRIADS OF FRAGMENTS THE EXPRESSION
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE HORSES TO LEAP THEM WITHOUT FALLING TO COMPLETE OUR DISCOMFORTS WE WERE OBLIGED TO CROSS THE HEAD OF A CREEK OF THE SEA IN WHICH THE WATER WAS AS HIGH AS OUR HORSES BACKS AND THE LITTLE WAVES
FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
IN A VALLEY SOUTH OF BERKELEY SOUND WHICH SOME OF OUR PARTY CALLED THE GREAT VALLEY OF FRAGMENTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO CROSS AN UNINTERRUPTED BAND HALF A MILE WIDE BY JUMPING FROM ONE POINTED STONE TO ANOTHER
WHEREAS WE HAVE IN THE EARTHQUAKES RECORDED BY THE NATIVES ON SOME ATOLLS AND IN THE GREAT FISSURES OBSERVED ON OTHER ATOLLS PLAIN EVIDENCE OF CHANGES AND DISTURBANCES IN PROGRESS IN THE SUBTERRANEAN REGIONS
DURING THE GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE CORDILLERA BY THE TORRENTS DELIVERING AT SUCCESSIVE LEVELS THEIR DETRITUS ON THE BEACHHEADS OF LONG NARROW ARMS OF THE SEA FIRST HIGH UP THE VALLEYS THEN LOWER AND LOWER DOWN AS THE LAND SLOWLY ROSE
THE JESUIT FALCONER WHOSE INFORMATION IS GENERALLY SO VERY CORRECT FIGURES IT AS A CONSIDERABLE RIVER RISING AT THE FOOT OF THE CORDILLERA WITH RESPECT TO ITS SOURCE
THE ATMOSPHERE RESPLENDENTLY CLEAR THE SKY AN INTENSE BLUE THE PROFOUND VALLEYS THE WILD BROKEN FORMS THE HEAPS OF RUINS PILED UP DURING THE LAPSE OF AGES THE BRIGHT COLOURED ROCKS CONTRASTED WITH THE QUIET MOUNTAINS OF SNOW
AS IF HE HAD BEEN FLOGGED WITH A WHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY TWO MEN ARRIVED WHO BROUGHT A PARCEL FROM THE NEXT POSTA TO BE FORWARDED TO THE GENERAL SO THAT BESIDES THESE TWO OUR PARTY CONSISTED THIS EVENING OF MY GUIDE AND SELF
THE ROAR WHICH THE MAYPU MADE AS IT RUSHED OVER THE GREAT ROUNDED FRAGMENTS WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SEA AMIDST THE DIN OF RUSHING WATERS
ONE DAY I OBSERVED A CORMORANT PLAYING WITH A FISH WHICH IT HAD CAUGHT EIGHT TIMES SUCCESSIVELY THE BIRD LET ITS PREY GO THEN DIVED AFTER IT AND ALTHOUGH IN DEEP WATER
SO THAT THE UNION OF SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMON BODY IS MORE STRIKING IN A CORALLINE THAN IN A TREE OUR CONCEPTION OF A COMPOUND ANIMAL WHERE IN SOME RESPECTS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH IS NOT COMPLETED
WE RODE OVER ONE THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WAS FAR BELOW THE LIMIT OF PERPETUAL SNOW AS THE EVENING DREW TO A CLOSE WE REACHED A SINGULAR BASIN LIKE PLAIN
OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
AND EACH MAN WHIRLING THE BALLS ROUND HIS HEAD AT LENGTH THE FOREMOST THREW THEM REVOLVING THROUGH THE AIR IN AN INSTANT THE OSTRICH ROLLED OVER AND OVER ITS LEGS FAIRLY LASHED TOGETHER BY THE THONG
THOUGH WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AS THE FATHER OF ONE MAN WAS AFRAID TO LET HIM GO AND ANOTHER WHO SEEMED WILLING WAS DESCRIBED TO ME AS SO FEARFUL THAT I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE HIM
EVIDENCE DERIVED FROM AN INCLINED STREAM OF LAVA AT THE EASTERN BASE OF THE PORTILLO
THE MAN WHO CAUGHT THEM ASSERTED THAT VERY MANY ARE INVARIABLY FOUND BLIND A SPECIMEN WHICH I PRESERVED IN SPIRITS WAS IN THIS STATE MISTER REID CONSIDERS IT TO BE THE EFFECT OF INFLAMMATION IN THE NICTITATING MEMBRANE
BUT JEMMY UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND WAS MOREOVER THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHEN YORK MINSTER AFTERWARDS CAME ON SHORE THEY NOTICED HIM IN THE SAME WAY AND TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO SHAVE YET HE HAD NOT TWENTY DWARF HAIRS ON HIS FACE WHILST WE ALL WORE OUR UNTRIMMED BEARDS
AND FINALLY THE LAST AND HIGHEST PINNACLE DISAPPEARING
THE MULES WOULD HALT EVERY FIFTY YARDS AND AFTER RESTING FOR A FEW SECONDS THE POOR WILLING ANIMALS STARTED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AGAIN THE SHORT BREATHING FROM THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE IS CALLED BY THE CHILENOS PUNA
WHETHER OF SOLID ROCK OR SALT WATER FIVE A
IN OTHER WORDS THE MOUNTAINS RISE MORE ABRUPTLY FROM THE PLAINS THAN FROM THE ALPINE COUNTRY OF CHILE A LEVEL AND BRILLIANTLY WHITE SEA OF CLOUDS WAS STRETCHED OUT BENEATH OUR FEET SHUTTING OUT THE VIEW OF THE EQUALLY LEVEL PAMPAS
THEY ARE NOCTURNAL IN THEIR HABITS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL FOOD IS THE ROOTS OF PLANTS WHICH ARE THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXTENSIVE AND SUPERFICIAL BURROWS THIS ANIMAL IS UNIVERSALLY KNOWN BY A VERY PECULIAR NOISE WHICH IT MAKES WHEN BENEATH THE GROUND
DURING THE FORMER VOYAGE OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY CAPTAIN FITZ ROY SEIZED ON A PARTY OF NATIVES AS HOSTAGES FOR THE LOSS OF A BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN TO THE GREAT JEOPARDY OF A PARTY EMPLOYED ON THE SURVEY
AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
THE SAUROPHAGUS SULPHURATUS IS TYPICAL OF THE GREAT AMERICAN TRIBE OF TYRANT FLYCATCHERS IN ITS STRUCTURE IT CLOSELY APPROACHES THE TRUE SHRIKES BUT IN ITS HABITS MAY BE COMPARED TO MANY BIRDS
AND AN ARRIERO WITH HIS TEN MULES AND A MADRINA THE MADRINA OR GODMOTHER IS A MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAGE SHE IS AN OLD STEADY MARE WITH A LITTLE BELL ROUND HER NECK AND WHEREVER SHE GOES THE MULES LIKE GOOD CHILDREN
DRY AND CLEAR ATMOSPHERE ELECTRICITY PAMPAS ZOOLOGY OF THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ANDES LOCUSTS GREAT BUGS MENDOZA
AT LENGTH WE REACHED THAT WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED LIKE A CARPET OF FINE GREEN TURF BUT WHICH TO OUR VEXATION TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPACT MASS OF LITTLE BEECH TREES ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
TO THE EASTWARD OF THIS CURVED LINE LIES THE BASIN OF THE COMPARATIVELY DAMP AND GREEN PLAINS OF BUENOS AYRES
WHEN IT UNDERWENT SUCH REMARKABLE FLEXURES WITHOUT BEING SHATTERED INTO FRAGMENTS AS THE QUARTZ INSENSIBLY PASSES INTO THE SANDSTONE IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE FORMER OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE SANDSTONE HAVING BEEN HEATED TO SUCH A DEGREE
AND THEIR BLACK HAIR BLOWING ACROSS THEIR SWARTHY FACES HEIGHTENS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THE WILDNESS OF THEIR APPEARANCE THEY TURNED OUT TO BE A PARTY OF BERNANTIO'S FRIENDLY TRIBE GOING TO A SALINA FOR SALT
PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED IN LONDON DURING THE NIGHT IT RAINED AND THE NEXT DAY SEVENTEENTH WAS VERY STORMY WITH MUCH HAIL AND SNOW
WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE SPOT ON PURPOSE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS TREATMENT BEING TOO MUCH TERRIFIED TO LEAVE THE HERD THEY ARE EASILY DRIVEN IF THEIR STRENGTH LAST OUT TO THE SETTLEMENT
ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
ONE LAZO WAS THROWN OVER HIS HORNS AS HE RUSHED AT THE HORSE AND ANOTHER ROUND HIS HIND LEGS IN A MINUTE THE MONSTER WAS STRETCHED POWERLESS ON THE GROUND AFTER THE LAZO HAS ONCE BEEN DRAWN TIGHTLY ROUND THE HORNS OF A FURIOUS ANIMAL
THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
THE SHELLS IN THE PEUQUENES OR OLDEST RIDGE PROVE AS BEFORE REMARKED THAT IT HAS BEEN UPRAISED FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEET SINCE A SECONDARY PERIOD
WHICH NOT ONLY ABUTS AGAINST ITS STEEP SIDES BUT LIKEWISE SEPARATES THE PARALLEL RANGES THE UNIFORMITY OF THE COLOURING GIVES AN EXTREME QUIETNESS TO THE VIEW
NOT TO REEFS IN GENERAL AS IMPLIED BY THEM BUT ONLY TO THOSE OF THE FRINGING CLASS MY SURPRISE HOWEVER CEASED WHEN I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT BY A STRANGE CHANCE ALL THE SEVERAL ISLANDS VISITED BY THESE EMINENT NATURALISTS
AND THUS LOSE PART OF THAT EASTERLY MOVEMENT WHICH IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GAINED FROM THE EARTH'S ROTATION AT MENDOZA ON THE EASTERN FOOT OF THE ANDES
IN NORTH AMERICA THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIES OF MOLOTHRUS
BUT FROM THAT POINT IN ITS COURSE TO THE SEA IT IS QUITE IMPASSABLE AND HENCE MAKES A MOST USEFUL BARRIER AGAINST THE INDIANS INSIGNIFICANT AS THIS STREAM IS
WAS EVERY NOW AND THEN A PUFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHICH MADE THE SHIP SURGE AT HER ANCHORS
WHEN THE INDIANS COME WE SHALL HAVE A FEAST IN THE MORNING WE ALL SALLIED FORTH TO HUNT AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD NOT MUCH SUCCESS THERE WERE SOME ANIMATED CHASES SOON AFTER STARTING
IN CONSEQUENCE IT IS NECESSARY TO GO TO THE GREAT EXPENSE OF IMPORTING FRESH HORSES FROM THE PLATA AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE PROBABLY WILL HAVE ITS BREED OF FALKLAND PONIES
AS FAR AS I AM AWARE THERE IS NO OTHER INSTANCE IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD OF SO SMALL A MASS OF BROKEN LAND DISTANT FROM A CONTINENT POSSESSING
IN THE MORNING WE RODE TO SOME NEIGHBOURING HILLS TO VIEW THE COUNTRY AND TO EXAMINE THE GEOLOGY AFTER DINNER THE SOLDIERS DIVIDED THEMSELVES INTO TWO PARTIES FOR A TRIAL OF SKILL WITH THE BOLAS
THEY KILL AND DEVOUR THEIR OLD WOMEN BEFORE THEY KILL THEIR DOGS THE BOY BEING ASKED BY MISTER LOW WHY THEY DID THIS ANSWERED DOGGIES CATCH OTTERS OLD WOMEN NO THIS BOY DESCRIBED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE KILLED BY BEING HELD OVER SMOKE AND THUS CHOKED
THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
WITH THESE APPENDAGES OF ONLY ONE FOURTH THE SIZE OF THE OUTSIDE ONES THEIR MOVEMENTS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE SPECIES BUT IN SOME I NEVER SAW THE LEAST MOTION WHILE OTHERS
AT OTHER TIMES THE SAUROPHAGUS HAUNTS THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WATER AND THERE LIKE A KINGFISHER REMAINING STATIONARY IT CATCHES ANY SMALL FISH WHICH MAY COME NEAR THE MARGIN THESE BIRDS ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY KEPT EITHER IN CAGES OR IN COURTYARDS
BUT HERE'S A POINTER THAT MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH EUREKA AND YOU'LL BE SOLID AT THE PALACE I'M SOLID NOW SOLID GLASS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND REJOINED THE SHAGGY MAN SLEEPILY
HEADING NOW DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHERE MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS AND CAVERNS AND FORESTS OF GREAT TREES ABOUNDED THIS PART OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE IT BELONGED TO OZMA AND OWED HER ALLEGIANCE WAS SO WILD AND SECLUDED
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT VIC SHE ADDED AS SHE SMOOTHED OUT HER APRON AND PUT IT ON AGAIN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER YOU'VE MISSED YOUR GUESS YOU'RE NOT A CONCERT YOU'RE A NUISANCE
EVEN THE FIELDS WERE NO LONGER CULTIVATED AND THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO RESEMBLE A WILDERNESS THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND BECAME UNEVEN AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON SCRUBBY UNDER BRUSH GREW ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY
DEAR ME EXCLAIMED OJO STARING HARD WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU NOTHING MUCH REPLIED THE PHONOGRAPH IN A SAD AND DEPRESSED VOICE
AND NEAR THIS SPRING STOOD A DESERTED CABIN SAID THE SHAGGY MAN HALTING HERE WE MAY AS WELL PASS THE NIGHT HERE WHERE THERE IS SHELTER FOR OUR HEADS AND GOOD WATER TO DRINK ROAD BEYOND HERE IS PRETTY BAD WORST WE SHALL HAVE TO TRAVEL SO LET'S WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE WE TACKLE IT
PAST THE LAST OF THE GREAT PLANTS AND NOT TILL HE WAS SAFELY BEYOND THEIR REACH DID HE CEASE HIS WHISTLING
ON HIS HEAD WAS A GREEN VELVET HAT WITH A JEWELED BAND WHICH WAS ALL SHAGGY AROUND THE BRIM RICH BUT SHAGGY LACES WERE AT HIS THROAT A COAT WITH SHAGGY EDGES WAS DECORATED WITH DIAMOND BUTTONS
SAID HE FOR THE FLAMES WOULD ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO WOULD THEN COME AND CAPTURE THE WOOZY AGAIN I GUESS THEY'LL BE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN THEY FIND HE'S ESCAPED SO THEY WILL DECLARED THE WOOZY
I AM NOW IN SPLENDID CONDITION AND AM REALLY OBLIGED TO THE TOTTENHOTS FOR THEIR KIND TREATMENT I FEEL MUCH THE SAME WAY SAID SCRAPS MY COTTON STUFFING HAD SAGGED A GOOD DEAL WITH THE DAY'S WALKING AND THEY'VE LOOSENED IT UP UNTIL I FEEL AS PLUMP AS A SAUSAGE
AND HE MADE ME OUT OF GLASS BECAUSE THE MEAT CATS DRINK TOO MUCH MILK HE ALSO MADE SCRAPS COME TO LIFE SO SHE COULD DO THE HOUSEWORK FOR HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE THEN WHY DID YOU BOTH LEAVE HIM ASKED DOROTHY
PUMPKINS ARE NOT PERMANENT MORE'S THE PITY AND IN TIME THEY SPOIL THAT IS WHY I GROW SUCH A GREAT FIELD OF PUMPKINS THAT I MAY SELECT A NEW HEAD WHENEVER NECESSARY WHO CARVES THE FACES ON THEM INQUIRED THE BOY
SAID THE WOOZY SO THE SHAGGY MAN TRIED IT BUT PULL AS HARD AS HE COULD HE FAILED TO GET THE HAIRS OUT OF THE WOOZY'S TAIL SO HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WIPED HIS SHAGGY FACE WITH A SHAGGY SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER INQUIRINGLY BUT NO ONE COULD ANSWER SUCH A PUZZLING QUESTION FINALLY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PHONOGRAPH PLAY OJO SIGHED
NOTHING COULD AWE THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND ALTHOUGH THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT UNEASY IN THESE SPLENDID SURROUNDINGS THE GLASS CAT WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE COURT AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE OCCASION PRETTY BIG WORDS BUT QUITE EXPRESSIVE
I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD MUSIC WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LIFE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN
SAID THE WOOZY GIVE ME ONE PLEASE SO THE SHAGGY MAN GAVE THE WOOZY A TABLET FROM HIS BOTTLE AND THE BEAST ATE IT IN A TWINKLING
SINCE I KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE
SOME OF THE PUMPKINS NOW RIPENING ON THE VINES WERE ALMOST AS LARGE AS JACK'S HOUSE AND HE TOLD DOROTHY HE INTENDED TO ADD ANOTHER PUMPKIN TO HIS MANSION
I'VE BEEN A ROVER ALL MY LIFE AND ALTHOUGH OZMA HAS GIVEN ME A SUITE OF BEAUTIFUL ROOMS IN HER PALACE
THE CAT FOLLOWING HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH SAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL PLAYING WITH PEBBLES SHE HAD PICKED UP OH THERE YOU ARE SHE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING OUT IT HAS BEEN DAYLIGHT A LONG TIME
IT'S IN PATCH TIME WHICH IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO RAG TIME AND I'VE COMPOSED IT IN HONOR OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED
IF YOU'LL LET US GET INTO YOUR HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT
IT REALLY MUST BE SOME ONE WHISTLING HE DECIDED FOR HE COULD FOLLOW THE STRAINS OF A PRETTY MUNCHKIN MELODY
THEN IT CAN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH
THERE'S A RAG TIME TUNE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAID THE MACHINE WHAT'S RAG TIME THE OPPOSITE OF CLASSICAL ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS AND TURNED OVER THE RECORD
THE SHAGGY MAN MADE NO REPLY TO THIS SPEECH
HE SAID I THINK IT HAS I THINK THE BOY HID IT IN HIS BASKET AND THEN GAVE THE BASKET TO YOU I ALSO THINK YOU DROPPED THE CLOVER INTO THIS VASE WHICH STOOD IN PRINCESS DOROTHY'S ROOM HOPING TO GET RID OF IT SO IT WOULD NOT PROVE THE BOY GUILTY
THAT HAS ALMOST PUT AN END TO WICKED SORCERY IN OUR LAND SO YOU SEE THE LAW WAS NOT A FOOLISH ONE BUT WISE AND JUST AND IN ANY EVENT IT IS WRONG TO DISOBEY A LAW
THE SHAGGY MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND GRIEVED BUT HE KNEW THAT OZMA NEVER MADE MISTAKES AND SO OJO MUST REALLY HAVE BROKEN THE LAW OF OZ
ADVISE YOU TO PURR SOFT AND LOOK HUMBLE IF YOU CAN AND NOW I'M GOING TO BED BUNGLE CONSIDERED THE SHAGGY MAN'S ADVICE SO CAREFULLY THAT HER PINK BRAINS WERE BUSY LONG AFTER THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY
THEN HE RELATED HOW THE BOY HAD STARTED OUT IN SEARCH OF THE THINGS NEEDED TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WOULD RESTORE THE UNFORTUNATES TO LIFE AND HOW HE HAD FOUND THE WOOZY AND TAKEN HIM ALONG BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PULL THE THREE HAIRS OUT OF ITS TAIL
AND INVITED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE WHICH THEY HAD PLANNED TO DO THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN JACK AND EXAMINED HIM ADMIRINGLY YOU ARE QUITE HANDSOME SHE SAID BUT NOT AS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AS THE SCARECROW
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER POPPED OUT OF THE CIRCULAR POT LIKE DWELLING WHILE FROM ALL THE OTHER BLACK OBJECTS CAME POPPING MORE CREATURES VERY LIKE JUMPING JACKS WHEN THEIR BOXES ARE UNHOOKED
THE OPENING WAS PERFECTLY SQUARE AND ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT A GOAT I GUESS THE WOOZY IS ASLEEP SAID SCRAPS SHALL I THROW IN A STONE TO WAKEN HIM NO PLEASE DON'T ANSWERED OJO
AFTER YOU LEFT OLD DOCTOR PIPT AND I HAD A DREADFUL QUARREL AND HE THREATENED TO SMASH ME TO PIECES IF I DIDN'T KEEP QUIET OF COURSE I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE A TALKING MACHINE IS SUPPOSED TO TALK AND MAKE A NOISE AND SOMETIMES MUSIC
AND PICKED OUT THE EASIEST PLACES TO GO ALL ITS LENGTH AND BREADTH WAS PAVED WITH SMOOTH BRICKS OF A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOR SO IT WAS SMOOTH
THEN SAID SCRAPS SUPPOSE WE GO IN AND FIND HIM VERY LIKELY IF WE ASK HIM POLITELY TO LET US PULL THREE HAIRS OUT OF THE TIP OF HIS TAIL HE WON'T HURT US IT WOULD HURT HIM I'M SURE
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID SCRAPS PLEASE DON'T QUARREL BEGGED OJO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JOURNEY AND QUARRELING MAKES ME DISCOURAGED TO BE BRAVE ONE MUST BE CHEERFUL SO I HOPE YOU WILL BE AS GOOD TEMPERED AS POSSIBLE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS A ROUND TABLE ON WHICH BREAKFAST WAS ALREADY PLACED SMOKING HOT ONLY ONE CHAIR WAS DRAWN UP TO THE TABLE WHERE A PLACE WAS SET FOR ONE PERSON NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN THE ROOM EXCEPT THE BOY AND BUNGLE
AND NEVER JEERED AT THE UNFORTUNATE BUT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY HAD SEEN A PRISONER THAT THEY CAST MANY CURIOUS LOOKS TOWARD THE BOY AND MANY OF THEM HURRIED AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE TO BE PRESENT DURING THE TRIAL WHEN OJO WAS ESCORTED INTO THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY SINCE WE MET YOU SIR HE SAID I KNOW BUT A LITTLE MISERY AT TIMES MAKES ONE APPRECIATE HAPPINESS MORE TELL ME PHONY
HE FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED THERE IN THE MAGNIFICENT EMERALD THRONE WHICH SPARKLED WITH COUNTLESS JEWELS SAT OZMA OF OZ IN HER ROBE OF STATE WHICH WAS EMBROIDERED WITH EMERALDS AND PEARLS
AND THERE WAS A GOOD FLOOR ON WHICH WAS ARRANGED SOME FURNITURE THAT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE IT IS CERTAIN THAT JACK PUMPKINHEAD MIGHT HAVE HAD A MUCH FINER HOUSE TO LIVE IN HAD HE WANTED IT FOR OZMA LOVED THE STUPID FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HER EARLIEST COMPANION
THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE FENCE REACHING IT AT A POINT EXACTLY OPPOSITE THAT WHERE THEY HAD ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE HOW DID YOU GET IN ASKED THE WOOZY WE CLIMBED OVER ANSWERED OJO I CAN'T DO THAT
OJO WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS SONG THAT HE APPLAUDED THE SINGER BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND SCRAPS FOLLOWED SUIT BY CLAPPING HER PADDED FINGERS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THEY MADE NO NOISE THE CAT POUNDED ON THE FLOOR WITH HER GLASS PAWS GENTLY SO AS NOT TO BREAK THEM
SOME OF THE CREATURES HAD ATTEMPTED TO TOSS HIM ALSO BUT FINDING HIS BODY TOO HEAVY THEY THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND A ROW OF THE IMPS SAT ON HIM AND HELD HIM FROM ASSISTING DOROTHY IN HER BATTLE
TO ACCOMPANY YOU TO THE GREAT CITY OF OZ AND INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIENDS THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SAID THE BOY GRATEFULLY I HOPE YOUR FRIENDS ARE NOT DIGNIFIED OBSERVED SCRAPS SOME ARE AND SOME ARE NOT HE ANSWERED
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN OJO IS FORGIVEN THE NEXT MORNING THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS WENT TO THE PRISON AND TOOK OJO AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE HE WAS SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GIRL RULER FOR JUDGMENT
THE ONLY RECORD I HAVE WITH ME EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH
TOWARD EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THEY REACHED A SANDY PLAIN WHERE WALKING WAS DIFFICULT BUT SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THEM THEY SAW A GROUP OF PALM TREES WITH MANY CURIOUS BLACK DOTS UNDER THEM SO THEY TRUDGED BRAVELY ON
THE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL I HAVE SAID THE BOY THAT IS I HAVE THE WOOZY AND THE HAIRS ARE IN HIS TAIL THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER I I YOU MAY TAKE IT AND KEEP IT SAID OZMA
LET US TAKE THE JAUNT IN AN EASY MANNER I'M AN OLD TRAVELER AND HAVE FOUND THAT I NEVER GAIN ANYTHING BY BEING IN A HURRY TAKE IT EASY IS MY MOTTO IF YOU CAN'T TAKE IT EASY TAKE IT AS EASY AS YOU CAN
IF YOU CAN KEEP THE WOOZY UNTIL YOU GET THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED YOU CAN TAKE THE BEAST AND HIS THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND LET HIM FIND A WAY TO EXTRACT EM
THEN SHE CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO DOROTHY I WOULDN'T CARE TO HELP OJO'S UNCLE BUT I WILL HELP OJO HE DID NOT BREAK THE LAW NO ONE CAN PROVE HE DID AND THAT GREEN WHISKERED SOLDIER HAD NO RIGHT TO ARREST HIM
IT SLIPPED OUT OF OJO'S HANDS AND HE AND SCRAPS BOTH ROLLED UPON THE GROUND IN A HEAP AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY BUMPED AGAINST THE ROCKY CAVE GIVE IT UP ADVISED THE GLASS CAT
HE WAS SO DISHEARTENED THAT HE SAT DOWN UPON A STUMP AND BEGAN TO CRY THE WOOZY LOOKED AT THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU ASKED THE BEAST THEN WHEN AT LAST YOU GET TO THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE
HIS VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE I'M IN NO HURRY BUT HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE WOOZY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AND CAME TROTTING OUT OF HIS CAVE AS THIS IS THE ONLY WOOZY THAT HAS EVER LIVED
BUT NEITHER STRUGGLES NOR PROTESTS HAD ANY EFFECT WHATEVER THE LEAF HELD HIM FIRMLY AND HE WAS A PRISONER THEN OJO QUIETED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO THINK
ONE THAT THE FEEBLE MINDED CAN REMEMBER THE WORDS OF AND THOSE IGNORANT OF MUSIC CAN WHISTLE OR SING THAT MAKES A POPULAR SONG POPULAR AND THE TIME IS COMING
A GIRL MADE OF PATCHWORK YOU KNOW SHE'S ALIVE AND HER NAME IS SCRAPS AND THERE'S A GLASS CAT GLASS ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN ALL GLASS AND ALIVE YES SAID OJO SHE HAS PINK BRAINS
EITHER IN THE LAND OF OZ OR OUT OF IT I MUST DESCRIBE IT TO YOU THE CREATURE WAS ALL SQUARES AND FLAT SURFACES AND EDGES ITS HEAD WAS AN EXACT SQUARE LIKE ONE OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS A CHILD PLAYS WITH THEREFORE
IN ONE PLACE A CASE FILLED WITH BOOKS
OJO GOT UP AND PUT ON HIS SHOES FINDING A TOILET STAND AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED HE WASHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND BRUSHED HIS HAIR THEN HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND SAID I WONDER IF THIS IS MY BREAKFAST EAT IT COMMANDED A VOICE AT HIS SIDE
THE ADVENTURERS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE AND DOROTHY ASKED ANXIOUSLY IS ANYBODY HURT NOT ME ANSWERED THE SCARECROW THEY HAVE GIVEN MY STRAW A GOOD SHAKING UP AND TAKEN ALL THE LUMPS OUT OF IT
ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS REGARDING THE QUEER SQUARE CREATURE WITH MUCH CURIOSITY BECAUSE I EAT UP ALL THE HONEY BEES WHICH THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO LIVE AROUND HERE KEEP TO MAKE THEM HONEY ARE YOU FOND OF EATING HONEY BEES
FOR BEDS THEY MUST USE THE SWEET DRIED GRASSES WHICH JACK HAD STREWN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT THAT SATISFIED DOROTHY AND OJO VERY WELL TOTO OF COURSE SLEPT BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS
AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR
EACH BEING FOUR SIDED THE ANIMAL WAS COVERED WITH A THICK SMOOTH SKIN AND HAD NO HAIR AT ALL EXCEPT AT THE EXTREME END OF ITS TAIL WHERE THERE GREW EXACTLY THREE STIFF STUBBY HAIRS
TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN BY THE TIME THEY CAME TO THE TREES BENEATH WHICH WERE THE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECTS THEY HAD MARKED FROM A DISTANCE DOZENS OF THEM WERE SCATTERED AROUND AND DOROTHY BENT NEAR TO ONE
I'D TAKE ANY ORDINARY WELL AND ENCLOSE IT SO AS TO MAKE IT DARK I FEAR THAT WOULDN'T DO REPLIED THE SCARECROW
A WHAT INQUIRED SCRAPS IT IS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND MOST PUZZLING EVER MANUFACTURED YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT
OF COURSE NOT SAID OJO YOU WERE CRAZY TO ACT SO BADLY AND GET THROWN OUTDOORS REMARKED BUNGLE AS THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
TOLLYDIGGLE SAT NEAR HIM WHILE HE ATE SEWING ON SOME FANCY WORK SHE HELD IN HER LAP
AGAIN THE SOLDIER PUT UPON THE BOY THE JEWELED HANDCUFFS AND WHITE PRISONER'S ROBE WITH THE PEAKED TOP AND HOLES FOR THE EYES OJO WAS SO ASHAMED BOTH OF HIS DISGRACE AND THE FAULT HE HAD COMMITTED THAT HE WAS GLAD TO BE COVERED UP IN THIS WAY
AND THEN THEY SEEMED TO BE JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEAF THAT WAS HUGGING HIM SUDDENLY THE WHOLE LEAF TOPPLED AND FELL CARRYING THE BOY WITH IT AND WHILE HE SPRAWLED AT FULL LENGTH THE FOLDS SLOWLY RELAXED AND SET HIM FREE HE SCRAMBLED QUICKLY TO HIS FEET
PLEASE DON'T GROWL THEN BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY GROWLING FOR I AM NOT ANGRY ONLY WHEN ANGRY DO I UTTER MY FEARFUL EAR SPLITTING SOUL SHUDDERING GROWL
SAID HE FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MUSIC MAKER CAN LAST LONG IN THE LAND OF OZ WHEN YOU ARE RESTED FRIENDS LET US GO ON OUR WAY DURING THE AFTERNOON THE TRAVELERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LONELY AND UNINHABITED PART OF THE COUNTRY
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHO'S COMING FOR I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE KEEP QUIET WHILE I PLAY YOU THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR IT WASN'T A VERY BAD TUNE NOR A VERY GOOD ONE BUT ALL LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE SHUT HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE
EXPLAINED THE GLASS CAT THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED
I PREFER TO REMAIN HERE SAID THE CAT I'VE NEARLY BEEN NICKED HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY AND IF THEY'RE GOING INTO DANGERS IT'S BEST FOR ME TO KEEP AWAY FROM THEM LET JELLIA JAMB KEEP HER TILL OJO RETURNS SUGGESTED DOROTHY
THAT WILL NOT BE BREAKING THE LAW FOR IT IS ALREADY PICKED AND THE CRIME OF PICKING IT IS FORGIVEN THANK YOU CRIED OJO GRATEFULLY THEN HE CONTINUED THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL THE WIZARD SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS SAID GUARDIAN I HAVE HERE A PRISONER GOOD GRACIOUS A PRISONER CRIED THE LITTLE MAN JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR WHICH ONE NOT THE SHAGGY MAN NO THIS BOY
THE BOY ADMITTED BUT THIS DANGER MUST BE FACED IF WE INTEND TO SAVE POOR UNC NUNKIE HOW SHALL WE GET OVER THE FENCE CLIMB ANSWERED SCRAPS AND AT ONCE SHE BEGAN CLIMBING UP THE ROWS OF BARS OJO FOLLOWED
DO NOT BLAME ME MISS GORGEOUS IF I REGARD YOU WITH SUSPICION MANY A SATIN RIBBON HAS A COTTON BACK SCRAPS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS BUT SHE HAD AN UNEASY MISGIVING THAT SHE HAD A COTTON BACK HERSELF
OH EXCLAIMED OJO GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER AND THEN HE ADDED WHO HAS SAVED ME SIR CAN'T YOU SEE
THERE'S NO FUN IN THAT SORT OF EATING ONE SHOULD ONLY EAT TO SUSTAIN LIFE REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN AND THAT TABLET IS EQUAL TO A PECK OF OTHER FOOD I DON'T CARE FOR IT
IT IS CALLED MY LULU THEN THE PHONOGRAPH BEGAN TO PLAY A STRAIN OF ODD JERKY SOUNDS WAS FOLLOWED BY THESE WORDS SUNG BY A MAN THROUGH HIS NOSE WITH GREAT VIGOR OF EXPRESSION
AND TO UNC NUNKIE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED I CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OJO WHO LOVES HIS UNCLE WILL BE UNHAPPY UNLESS HE CAN SAVE HIM ALSO I FEEL IT IS WRONG TO LEAVE THOSE TWO VICTIMS STANDING AS MARBLE STATUES WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE ALIVE
WITH THIS SHE RAN UP THE PATH SKIPPING AND DANCING AND THEN TURNED TO AWAIT THEM IT IS QUITE A DISTANCE FROM HERE TO THE EMERALD CITY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN SO WE SHALL NOT GET THERE TO DAY NOR TO MORROW THEREFORE
SAID THE GLASS CAT IN A NERVOUS VOICE I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE YOU KNOW AND CAN'T STAND MANY HARD
BUT IF THE TOTTENHOTS SLEPT THERE ALL DAY THE CHILDREN THOUGHT THEY COULD SLEEP THERE AT NIGHT SO OJO LOWERED HIMSELF DOWN AND FOUND IT WAS NOT VERY DEEP THERE'S A SOFT CUSHION ALL OVER
BUT THE PHONOGRAPH CONTINUED PLAYING THE DREARY TUNE SO OJO SEIZED THE CRANK JERKED IT FREE AND THREW IT INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER THE MOMENT THE CRANK STRUCK THE GROUND IT BOUNDED BACK TO THE MACHINE AGAIN AND BEGAN WINDING IT UP
JACK TURNED AT THIS TO EXAMINE THE SCARECROW CRITICALLY AND HIS OLD FRIEND SLYLY WINKED ONE PAINTED EYE AT HIM THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES REMARKED THE PUMPKINHEAD WITH A SIGH
SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL EARNESTLY DO ALL THOSE QUEER PEOPLE YOU MENTION REALLY LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ EVERY ONE OF EM I EVEN FORGOT ONE THING DOROTHY'S PINK KITTEN
RUGGEDO DID YOU SAY RUGGEDO CRIED THE MAN BECOMING MUCH EXCITED THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID REPLIED SHAGGY AND I BELIEVE SHE IS RIGHT
QUITE DISCONCERTED BY THIS UNEXPECTED EFFECT OF THE MAGNET SHAGGY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE QUEEN'S ENCIRCLING ARMS AND QUICKLY HID THE TALISMAN IN HIS POCKET THE ADVENTURERS FROM OOGABOO WERE NOW HIS FIRM FRIENDS
AND STAGGERED DOWN THE PATH BY THE WAY HE HAD COME THEY LET HIM DEPART IN SILENCE FOR WITH ALL HE HAD TAKEN THE MASSES OF JEWELS UPON THE GROUND
AND UNLESS RUGGEDO'S EYES BEHELD THE TALISMAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIM AS FOR BETSY BOBBIN AND HER MULE HE BELIEVED KALIKO HAD PLACED THEM IN THE SLIMY CAVE WHILE ANN AND HER OFFICERS HE THOUGHT SAFELY IMPRISONED IN THE PIT
WHO HAD SHAKEN OFF THE GRASP OF THE OFFICERS WITHOUT EFFORT AND WAS NOW TRYING TO PULL THE BATTERED CROWN FROM OFF HIS EYES SHAGGY WHO WAS ALWAYS POLITE HELPED HIM TO DO THIS AND WHEN THE MAN WAS FREE AND COULD SEE AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HIS VISITORS WITH EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
YOU SEE SAID ANN HOW HELPLESS I AM HAD NOT PRIVATE FILES PROVED HIMSELF A TRAITOR AND A DESERTER I WOULD GLADLY HAVE CONQUERED THIS RUGGEDO BUT AN ARMY WITHOUT A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS LIKE A BEE WITHOUT A STINGER
THERE IS NO COAST HERE WAS THE REPLY
HE CAME OUT OF HIS THRONE TO STAND BEFORE THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE WAVED HIS HANDS PALMS DOWNWARD IN SEVEN SEMICIRCLES OVER HIS VICTIM'S HEAD SAYING IN A LOW BUT CLEAR TONE OF VOICE THE MAGIC WUGWA
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TOO SAID FILES DO I GET A SALARY INQUIRED TIK TOK YOU GET YOUR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER ANSWERED THE QUEEN YES REMARKED FILES ONE HALF OF THE PLUNDER GOES TO QUEEN ANN
I WONDER WHAT IS THE BEST AND SUREST WAY TO WAKEN A DRAGON
BECAUSE ALL TUBES ARE MADE THAT WAY BUT THIS TUBE IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVERYONE IS FORBIDDEN TO FALL INTO IT WE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE EXPLAINED BETSY AND POLYCHROME ADDED I AM QUITE SURE THAT RUGGEDO THE NOME KING PUSHED US DOWN THAT TUBE HA
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE LET QUOX DO THE CONQUERING SAID POLYCHROME DANCING LIGHTLY UPON A POINT OF ROCK AND FLUTTERING HER BEAUTIFUL DRAPERIES BUT PERHAPS THE DRAGON WAS WISE TO LET HER GO FIRST FOR WHEN SHE FAILS TO CONQUER RUGGEDO
THEN YOU ARE ENEMIES OF RUGGEDO
BUT I BEG YOU NOW TO COME FORTH AND FACE US WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS NONE HERE WILL LAUGH OR JEER HOWEVER UNHANDSOME YOU MAY BE NO INDEED THEY ALL ADDED PLEADINGLY BUT THE UGLY ONE REFUSED THE INVITATION
SHE TURNED AWAY IN A SHAMEFACED MANNER FOR ANN AND HER OFFICERS WERE INDEED A SIGHT TO BEHOLD HER MAJESTY'S CLOTHING ONCE SO RICH AND GORGEOUS WAS NOW WORN AND TORN INTO SHREDS BY HER LONG CRAWL THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHICH BY THE WAY
HAD RECOVERED FROM HANK'S KICK AND HAD PICKED THEMSELVES UP THEIR FIRST ACT WAS TO TURN TIK TOK ON HIS BACK AND PUT A HEAVY DIAMOND ON TOP OF HIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT GET UP AGAIN THEN THEY CAREFULLY PUT HIS GUN IN A CORNER OF THE CAVERN
PERHAPS YOU'LL KNOW HIM BY THAT THE ONLY PERSON WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CAVERN SAID ANN HAS RUN AWAY FROM US WHENEVER WE APPROACHED HIM HE HIDES OVER YONDER AMONG THE TREES THAT ARE NOT GOLD AND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIS FACE
AND POLYCHROME DANCED WITH GLEE BUT ANN WAS FURIOUS AT THIS IGNOBLE DEFEAT OF HER GALLANT FORCES BY ONE SMALL MULE PRIVATE FILES I COMMAND YOU TO DO YOUR DUTY SHE CRIED AGAIN
INQUIRED MAJOR STOCKINGS IN AN ANXIOUS VOICE OF COURSE ANSWERED SHAGGY HE OWNS ALL THE METAL THAT LIES UNDERGROUND GOLD SILVER COPPER BRASS AND TIN
AND HE REFUSES TO COME OUT OF THAT HOUSE AND FACE US I'LL TELL YOU REPLIED BETSY LET HIM PUT ON A MASK THE VERY IDEA I WAS SEEKING EXCLAIMED SHAGGY JOYFULLY AND THEN HE CALLED OUT BROTHER
AND HE CAST AN EVIL LOOK AT THE OTHER PRISONERS AND SAID NEVER MIND THE GIRL AND THE DONKEY HERE ARE FOUR AT LEAST WHO CANNOT ESCAPE MY VENGEANCE LET ME SEE I BELIEVE I'LL CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT TIK TOK
AND THAT TIK TOK WOULD SOON BE MELTED IN A CRUCIBLE
REPLIED POLYCHROME I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF THIS PASSAGE WHICH WAS ONCE BUILT BY A MAGICIAN WHO WAS A GREAT TRAVELER HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE BOTHER OF GOING AROUND THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT HE TUMBLED THROUGH THE TUBE SO FAST
AND RUGGEDO EVEN CAME DOWN FROM HIS THRONE TO ASSIST HIS GENERAL BUT NEVER COULD THEY LAY HANDS UPON THE LOVELY SKY FAIRY WHO FLITTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHT AND CONSTANTLY DEFIED THEM WITH HER MERRY LAUGHTER AS SHE EVADED THEIR EFFORTS
NO ONE SAID PANG THE COVER WAS THERE BUT THE PRISONERS WERE NOT UNDER IT IN THAT CASE SNARLED THE KING
AND HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE ALL AROUND WAS DARKNESS AND THEY WERE NOT FALLING DIRECTLY DOWNWARD BUT SEEMED TO BE SLIDING ALONG A STEEP INCLINE HANK'S HOOFS WERE RESTING UPON SOME SMOOTH SUBSTANCE OVER WHICH HE SLID WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF THE WIND
ALTHOUGH THE EXACT MAGICAL FORMULA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IT IS UNLAWFUL IN ALL CIVILIZED COUNTRIES FOR ANYONE TO TRANSFORM A PERSON INTO A DOVE BY MUTTERING THE WORDS RUGGEDO USED THERE WERE NO LAWS TO PREVENT THE NOME KING FROM PERFORMING THIS TRANSFORMATION
PERHAPS A MORE UNHAPPY AND HOMESICK LOT OF CONQUERORS NEVER EXISTED THAN THIS BAND FROM OOGABOO AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF WANDERING IN THEIR MARVELOUS PRISON THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT RUGGEDO HAD COME AMONG THEM
YOU CAN SOON BRING THE NOME KING TO REASON SO IT WAS DECIDED TO WAIT NO LONGER SHAGGY WALKED THROUGH THE ENTRANCE FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME THE OTHERS THEY HAD NO THOUGHT OF DANGER TO THEMSELVES
SAID TIK TOK PICKING UP THE GUN AND EXAMINING IT WONDERINGLY FOR HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A WEAPON THEN ANN STRAPPED THE KNAPSACK TO TIK TOK'S COPPER BACK AND SAID NOW WE ARE READY TO MARCH TO RUGGEDO'S KINGDOM AND CONQUER IT
FOR JUST AS SOON AS I AM SATISFIED THAT QUEEN ANN AND HER ARMY HAVE FAILED TO CONQUER RUGGEDO I SHALL ENTER THE CAVERNS AND SHOW THE KING MY LOVE MAGNET THAT HE CANNOT RESIST THEREFORE THE CONQUEST WILL BE MADE WITH EASE
SHE PICKED UP A PIECE OF ROCK AND POUNDED AGAINST HIS EYELIDS WITH IT SAYING WAKE UP QUOX WAKE UP BUT HE WOULD NOT WAKEN DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE SIGHED THE LOVELY RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
YOU MUST CONQUER EVERYONE UNDER ITS SURFACE AS WELL AS THOSE UPON ITS SURFACE AND NO ONE IN ALL THE WORLD NEEDS CONQUERING SO MUCH AS RUGGEDO WHO IS HE ASKED ANN THE METAL MONARCH KING OF THE NOMES IS HE RICH
THEY ALL STOOD LOOKING FROM ONE ROAD TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY THE PATHS RADIATED FROM THE LITTLE CLEARING LIKE THE RAYS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND EACH PATH SEEMED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS FILES AND THE ROSE PRINCESS WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
SAID COLONEL PLUM EAGERLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF BRAVERY AND ONE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO POSSESS THEM ALL
SHE WALKED AROUND QUOX TWO OR THREE TIMES TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME TENDER PLACE ON HIS BODY WHERE A THUMP OR A PUNCH MIGHT BE FELT BUT HE LAY EXTENDED ALONG THE ROCKS WITH HIS CHIN FLAT UPON THE GROUND AND HIS LEGS DRAWN UNDERNEATH HIS BODY
RUBBING HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY TOGETHER ONE ENEMY IS OUT OF MY WAY AND NOW FOR THE OTHERS PERHAPS MY READERS SHOULD BE WARNED NOT TO ATTEMPT THE ABOVE TRANSFORMATION FOR
AND THE BEAUTIFUL ROSE PRINCESS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE AND I WON'T DO IT HE ASSERTED YOU MUST CRIED ANN IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY ORDERS I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY ORDERS FROM MY OFFICERS OBJECTED THE PRIVATE
I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN TO REPAY ME FOR ALL MY BOTHER REPLIED THE NOME KING THEN HE SAID TO KALIKO SUMMON THE EXECUTIONERS KALIKO AT ONCE WITHDREW AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A SCORE OF NOMES
SHOULDER YOUR GUN AND STAND READY TO MARCH ADVISED FILES SO TIK TOK HELD THE GUN STRAIGHT AND STOOD STILL WHAT NEXT HE ASKED THE QUEEN TURNED TO SHAGGY WHICH ROAD LEADS TO THE METAL MONARCH'S CAVERN
THERE IS BUT ONE SLIMY CAVE AND THERE IS NO ONE IN IT RETURNED PANG POSITIVELY RUGGEDO WAS BEGINNING TO BE ALARMED AS WELL AS ANGRY HOWEVER THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MADE HIM THE MORE VINDICTIVE
THAT IS A KINDLY DEED REPLIED UGLY IN A SAD VOICE BUT I DREAD TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD IN THIS DIREFUL CONDITION UNLESS I REMAIN FOREVER MASKED MY DREADFUL FACE WOULD CURDLE ALL THE MILK AND STOP ALL THE CLOCKS
I KNOW AND I'LL GO AS SOON AS I HAVE FILLED MY POCKETS SAID RUGGEDO MEEKLY THEN FILL THEM AND BE GONE RETURNED THE NEW KING RUGGEDO OBEYED STOOPING DOWN HE BEGAN GATHERING UP JEWELS BY THE HANDFUL
AS QUEEN ANN REACHED THE PLACE AND BEHELD HER KNEELING ARMY PERMIT US TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES REPLIED SHAGGY STEPPING FORWARD THIS IS TIK TOK THE CLOCKWORK MAN WHO WORKS BETTER THAN SOME MEAT PEOPLE
AND HERE IS PRINCESS OZGA OF ROSELAND JUST NOW UNFORTUNATELY EXILED FROM HER KINGDOM OF ROSES I NEXT PRESENT POLYCHROME A SKY FAIRY WHO LOST HER BOW BY AN ACCIDENT AND CAN'T FIND HER WAY HOME
AND RANGED BEFORE THE KING WERE THE ROSE PRINCESS FILES AND THE SHAGGY MAN TIK TOK STILL LAY UPON THE FLOOR WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE BIG DIAMOND RUGGEDO WAS NOW IN A MORE CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
CRIED THE COLONELS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
BUT HANK ONLY UTTERED A PLAINTIVE HEE HAW FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBEY AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES HAD PASSED AND NO HARM HAD BEFALLEN THEM BETSY GAINED COURAGE SHE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL
NOT EVEN TO RESCUE MY FRIENDS WOULD I LIVE IN YOUR KINGDOM
THE EYELIDS HAD BIG SILVER SCALES ON THEM LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIS BODY POLYCHROME MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT QUOX WAS DEAD HAD SHE NOT KNOWN THAT DRAGONS DO NOT DIE EASILY
CLEVERLY MADE OF TWIGS AND GOLDEN BRANCHES WOVEN TOGETHER AS THEY APPROACHED THE PLACE THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A FORM THAT DARTED INTO THE HUT AND SLAMMED THE DOOR TIGHT SHUT AFTER HIM SHAGGY MAN RAN TO THE DOOR AND CRIED ALOUD BROTHER
SO AFTER A TIME THEY ABANDONED THE CHASE AND RUGGEDO RETURNED TO HIS THRONE AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WITH A FINELY WOVEN HANDKERCHIEF OF CLOTH OF GOLD WELL SAID POLYCHROME WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO NOW
HAD MADE RAGS OF EVERY INCH OF THEIR ONCE BRILLIANT UNIFORMS A MORE TATTERED AND WOEFUL ARMY NEVER CAME OUT OF A BATTLE THAN THESE HARMLESS VICTIMS OF THE ROCKY PASSAGE BUT IT HAD SEEMED THEIR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE CRUEL NOME KING
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH IT INVISIBLE HANDS RAISED TIK TOK FROM THE MARBLE BASIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BESIDE IT WATER DRIPPING FROM EVERY JOINT OF HIS COPPER BODY
PERHAPS RUGGEDO HIMSELF MIGHT BREAK HIS OWN ENCHANTMENT SUGGESTED ANN BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE ALLOWED THE OLD KING TO ESCAPE NEVER MIND MY DEAR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY CONSOLINGLY I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN
WHICH SWUNG BACK AND FORTH DURING THE SWIFT JOURNEY AND POMMELED EVERYONE WITHIN THEIR REACH NOW FOLLOWED QUEEN ANN WHO HAD STRUCK THE TUBE IN A SITTING POSITION AND WENT FLYING ALONG WITH A DASH AND ABANDON THAT THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED THE POOR LADY
AND TURN ALL THE HATRED IN HIS HEART INTO LOVE RUGGEDO WAS PROUD OF HIS HATRED AND ABHORRED LOVE OF ANY SORT REALLY SAID HE
ROARED THE KING I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU KALIKO AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW I'LL TURN YOU INTO A POTATO AND MAKE SARATOGA CHIPS OF YOU THE NEXT TO CONSIDER HE ADDED MORE MILDLY IS THE SHAGGY MAN
KALIKO WENT AWAY LOOKING SAD AND DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THE KING WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ENOUGH TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT
THEY HAD BEGUN TO RECOVER THEIR WITS THIS IS AWFUL HANK CRIED BETSY IN A LOUD VOICE AND QUEEN ANN HEARD HER AND CALLED OUT
SHE MAY BECOME MORE MODEST IN HER AMBITIONS WHERE IS THE DRAGON NOW INQUIRED OZGA UP THERE ON THE ROCKS REPLIED FILES
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AROUND HER SHE SAW THE QUEEN AND THE PECULIAR PERSON STRUGGLING TOGETHER UPON THE GROUND WHERE THE MAN WAS TRYING TO CHOKE ANN AND SHE HAD BOTH HANDS IN HIS BUSHY HAIR AND WAS PULLING WITH ALL HER MIGHT SOME OF THE OFFICERS WHEN THEY GOT UPON THEIR FEET
SO I BELIEVE I'LL GO IN RIGHT AWAY AND PUT AN END TO ALL THIS WORRY
SAID THE UGLY ONE IN A VOICE OF DESPAIR WHY NOT BROTHER ASKED SHAGGY ANXIOUSLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ME CAME THE ANSWER THROUGH THE CLOSED DOOR NO TELL ME BROTHER WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
THE MULE NOW DASHED FORWARD AND BEGAN BACKING UPON THE OFFICERS AND KICKING FIERCE AND DANGEROUS HEELS AT THEM THE ATTACK WAS SO SUDDEN THAT THE OFFICERS SCATTERED LIKE DUST IN A WHIRLWIND
BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOME KING TO BE HIS MASTER AND WAS READY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS THEREFORE HE REPEATED SHAGGY'S SPEECH TO THE KING WHO AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS IN GRAVE DANGER
AS TIK TOK HAS TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS SLOW MECHANICAL WAY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY ARE LIKELY TO FAIL ASKED THE ROSE PRINCESS I DO INDEED REPLIED SHAGGY
I WILL MERELY CLAIM THAT I WAS GOOD LOOKING AND I WAKENED THE NEXT MORNING THE HOMELIEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD I AM SO REPULSIVE THAT WHEN I LOOK IN A MIRROR I FRIGHTEN MYSELF POOR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY SOFTLY
THEN SINCE THEY ARE NOW HELPLESS WHY NOT RELEASE THEM AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE BECAUSE I HATE EM AND MEAN TO MAKE EM SUFFER FOR THEIR INVASION BUT I'LL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU SWEET POLLY REMAIN HERE AND LIVE WITH ME
AND POSSESSES NO MAGIC POWERS WHATEVER
YOU WILL CARRY THE GUN THAT MISTER FILES USED A SOL DIER MUST BE A BLE TO RUN AS WELL AS TO FIGHT PROTESTED TIK TOK
AND PICKED UP THEIR DISCARDED SWORDS PRIVATE FILES SEIZE AND BIND THESE PRISONERS SCREAMED THE QUEEN NO SAID FILES THROWING DOWN HIS GUN AND REMOVING THE KNAPSACK WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HIS BACK I RESIGN MY POSITION AS THE ARMY OF OOGABOO
HER HIS HANDS MET IN AIR AND NOW THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER WAS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AS SMILING AND COMPOSED AS BEFORE
AND ARE OBSTRUCTING OUR JOURNEY IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO CONQUER YOU UNWORTHY THOUGH YOU MAY BE OF SUCH HIGH HONOR THAT'S ALL RIGHT REPLIED SHAGGY CONQUER US AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE WE DON'T MIND BUT WE WON'T BE ANYBODY'S SLAVES
AS ONE OF THE OFFICERS STEPPED ON A SHARP STONE OR KNOCKED HIS FUNNYBONE AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR'S SWORD HANDLE THEN OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES MARCHED PRIVATE FILES BEARING THE BANNER OF OOGABOO WHICH FLUTTERED FROM A LONG POLE
HAVE THE GOLD CRUCIBLE HEATED TO A WHITE SEETHING HEAT AND THEN WE'LL DUMP THE COPPER MAN INTO IT AND MELT HIM UP BUT YOUR MAJESTY PROTESTED KALIKO WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM AFTER SENDING A HUNDRED NOMES TO SEARCH FOR THE OOGABOO PEOPLE
ALSO THEY HOPED THEY HAD SEEN THE LAST OF THE DEGRADED KING I'M AWFUL GLAD HE'S GONE SAID BETSY SIGHING DEEPLY IF HE DOESN'T GET RECKLESS AND SPEND HIS WEALTH FOOLISHLY HE'S GOT ENOUGH TO START A BANK WHEN HE GETS TO OKLAHOMA BUT MY BROTHER
AND ARRANGED HIS WHISKERS ON MY WORD SAID HE YOU ARE A VERY CAPTIVATING CREATURE MOREOVER I PERCEIVE YOU ARE A FAIRY I AM POLYCHROME THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID PROUDLY
NOT FOR A SIN GLE SEC OND I CAN NOT FIGHT
SHE NOW TURNED TO THE OFFICERS AND SAID I MUST ASK YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR I KNOW IT IS UNDIGNIFIED IN OFFICERS TO FIGHT BUT UNLESS YOU IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE PRIVATE FILES AND FORCE HIM TO OBEY MY ORDERS THERE WILL BE NO PLUNDER FOR ANY OF US
THIS KALIKO DID AND MEANWHILE THE WATCHERS OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WERE GROWING MORE AND MORE UNEASY ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS I DON'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT THE OOGABOO PEOPLE SAID POLYCHROME WHO HAD GROWN SOBER WITH WAITING
NEVER MIND THE FIRE AND PINCERS MY GOOD BROTHERS IT WILL BE BEST TO TAKE THESE STRANGERS TO THE PRIVATE CITIZEN VERY WELL TUBEKINS RESPONDED A VOICE DEEP AND POWERFUL THAT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE AIR FOR THE SPEAKER WAS INVISIBLE ALL OUR FRIENDS GAVE A JUMP AT THIS
OF COURSE SAID FILES THE FIELD FLOWERS MUST BE SECOND COUSINS TO A ROSE PRINCESS AND I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THEM THEY WILL TELL YOU SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE FLOWERS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF WHITE DAISIES GOLDEN BUTTERCUPS BLUEBELLS AND DAFFODILS GROWING BY THE ROADSIDE
BUT SOON THEY GAINED COURAGE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE PECULIAR PERSON AS HE WAS A TYPE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LAND WHOM THEY AFTERWARD MET I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE HIS FACE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT LACKED EXPRESSION
AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM BEING CURIOUS TO WITNESS THE FINAL RESCUE OF HIS LONG SOUGHT LONG LOST BROTHER
AND EVEN HER SHOES WERE SO CUT AND SLASHED THAT THEY WERE READY TO FALL FROM HER FEET THE OFFICERS HAD FARED SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN THEIR LEADER FOR HOLES WERE WORN IN THE KNEES OF THEIR TROUSERS WHILE SHARP POINTS OF ROCK IN THE ROOF AND SIDES OF THE TUNNEL
ALL MADE OF PRECIOUS METALS AND SET WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES NOW PANG SAID RUGGEDO ADDRESSING THE LEADER OF THE EXECUTIONERS FETCH THE ARMY OF OOGABOO AND THEIR QUEEN FROM THE PIT AND TORTURE THEM HERE IN MY PRESENCE
BY AND BY A NOISE SOUNDED FROM WITHIN THE HUT ARE YOU READY ASKED SHAGGY YES BROTHER CAME THE REPLY AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN TO ALLOW THE UGLY ONE TO STEP FORTH BETSY MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED ALOUD
HE SAID AND THEN HIS COPPER JAWS CLICKED TOGETHER AND HE COULD SAY NO MORE HE NEXT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK BUT AFTER SEVERAL AWKWARD TRIALS FOUND HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS JOINTS PEALS OF JEERING LAUGHTER FROM PERSONS UNSEEN GREETED TIK TOK'S FAILURE
I CANNOT SAID HE INDEED I CANNOT FACE STRANGERS UGLY AS I AM SHAGGY MAN TURNED TO THE GROUP SURROUNDING HIM WHAT SHALL I DO HE ASKED IN SORROWFUL TONES I CANNOT LEAVE MY DEAR BROTHER HERE
WHERE I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ASKED BETSY HER VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE THROUGH NERVOUSNESS WHY
TIK TOK TACKLES A TOUGH TASK WHILE SHAGGY AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD HUDDLED IN A GROUP AT ONE SIDE THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WAS APPROACHING ALONG THE PATHWAY THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET BEING NOW AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A DISMAL GROAN
RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
INASMUCH AS MY FATHER HAS GOT IT NOW AND IS SAVING IT UP FOR ME WHICH IS A HIGHLY VIRTUOUS PURPOSE AND GOING BACK TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN GOOD DID COME OF IT TO HIM TOO FOR HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THINKING OF IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG
HOW ODD THINGS COME ABOUT NOW THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE MET HER IN THE COUNTRY WELL HEARING THIS MENTION OF THEIR OLD FRIEND'S NAME THE FOUR MISS KENWIGSES GATHERED ROUND NICHOLAS OPEN EYED AND MOUTHED
GO ON SAID RALPH NODDING HIS HEAD DELIBERATELY AND SPEAKING IN A TONE WHOSE STUDIED COLDNESS PRESENTED A STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE RAPTUROUS SQUEAK TO WHICH HIS FRIEND HAD GRADUALLY MOUNTED GO ON YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO ASK ME THAT
HE SUDDENLY TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEANING OVER THE TABLE AND LOOKING ME FULL IN THE FACE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WEEL MISTHER WE'VE BEEN VARA PLEASANT TOOGATHER
OH SAD SAD VERY SAD SAID NED THE BROTHERS INTERCHANGED A GLANCE AND LOOKING AT KATE FOR A LITTLE TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING SHOOK HANDS AND NODDED AS IF THEY WERE CONGRATULATING EACH OTHER ON SOMETHING VERY DELIGHTFUL
ONLY THIS DAY CRIED A GREAT MANY VOICES THERE'S A GOOD MAN DO THE PRESENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO HIM SAID MISTER KENWIGS REVERTING TO HIS CALAMITY THE PIPES THE SNUFF BOXES
HE INSTITUTED A STRICT INQUIRY WHETHER ANY STRANGER HAD BEEN SEEN AND SEARCHED HIMSELF BEHIND THE TREE AND THROUGH THE ORCHARD AND UPON THE LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING AND IN EVERY PLACE NEAR WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO LIE CONCEALED BUT ALL IN VAIN
WHO HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE PASSAGE AND ABOUT THE STREET DOOR TO DISCUSS THE EVENT IN ALL ITS BEARINGS INDEED THE EXCITEMENT EXTENDED ITSELF OVER THE WHOLE STREET AND GROUPS OF LADIES MIGHT BE SEEN STANDING AT THE DOORS
AND PERHAPS LIKE THE STRIPLING WHO HAD BROUGHT DISHONOUR AND LOSS OF FORTUNE ON HIS HEAD BUT ONE TENDER THOUGHT OR ONE OF NATURAL REGRET IN HIS WHIRLWIND OF PASSION AND REMORSE
NICHOLAS AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY FROM THEIR LEAVING HOME FOUND HIMSELF WITHIN A VERY FEW MILES OF THE SPOT WHERE THE HAPPIEST YEARS OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED AND WHICH WHILE IT FILLED HIS MIND WITH PLEASANT AND PEACEFUL THOUGHTS
MISTER KENWIGS SAT HIMSELF DOWN IN A CHAIR AND DEFIED THE NURSE WHO MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM AND RETURNED WITH A STREAM OF MATRONS DECLARING THAT MISTER KENWIGS HAD SPOKEN BLASPHEMY AGAINST HIS FAMILY AND MUST BE RAVING MAD
AS IF TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT LIFE WAS STILL THERE AND THAT HE HAD NOT FALLEN INTO THAT DEEP SLUMBER FROM WHICH ON EARTH THERE IS NO WAKING WHILE HE WAS THUS EMPLOYED THE CLOSED EYES OPENED AND ON THE PALE FACE THERE CAME A PLACID SMILE
A PAIR OF INDIA RUBBER GOLOSHES THAT COST SIX AND SIX AH IT WON'T BEAR THINKING OF INDEED CRIED THE MATRONS GENERALLY BUT IT'LL ALL COME HOME TO HIM NEVER FEAR MISTER KENWIGS LOOKED DARKLY UPON THE LADIES
AND THERE'S THEIR KEEP TO BE SUBSTRACTED BESIDES THERE'S NOTHING LOST NEITHER BY ONE'S BEING HERE BECAUSE THE BOYS MONEY COMES IN JUST THE SAME AS IF I WAS AT HOME AND MISSUS SQUEERS SHE KEEPS THEM IN ORDER
IMPERCEPTIBLY DIMINISH OUR APPREHENSIONS AND BEGET COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCE IF NOT A VAGUE AND RECKLESS CONFIDENCE IN SOME RELIEF THE MEANS OR NATURE OF WHICH WE CARE NOT TO FORESEE
VERY GOOD COBBEY WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T MAKE YOU SNIFF A LITTLE WITHOUT BEEF
BUT THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE I AM HIS DETAINING CREDITOR FOR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS YOU TALK AS IF YOU WERE THE ONLY DETAINING CREDITOR SAID RALPH PULLING OUT HIS POCKET BOOK I AM ANOTHER FOR
IF THE ENERGY OF MAN CAN COMPASS THE DISCOVERY OF YOUR FRAUD AND TREACHERY BEFORE YOUR DEATH IF WEALTH REVENGE AND JUST HATRED CAN HUNT AND TRACK YOU THROUGH YOUR WINDINGS YOU WILL YET BE CALLED TO A DEAR ACCOUNT FOR THIS
BUT GREAT IMPROVEMENTS AND FACILITIES TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF A GOOD ONE HAVE BEEN FURNISHED OF LATE YEARS I CANNOT CALL TO MIND NOW HOW I CAME TO HEAR ABOUT YORKSHIRE SCHOOLS
THAT'S THE WORST OF EVER BEING IN WITH A OWDACIOUS CHAP LIKE THAT OLD NICKLEBY
INFLUENCED AS YOU ARE UPON THE STEP YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE ALTHOUGH YOU CANNOT BE FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE VILLAINY OF THIS MAN TO WHOM YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE YOUR HAND SOME OF HIS
THEY REMAINED QUITE STILL AND NOW NOT ONLY APPEARED UNOBSERVED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS NOT BOLTED FOR THE BOLT HAD NO HASP BUT WARILY AND WITH NOISELESS FOOTSTEPS ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM
ONCE KATE WAS LOST AND AFTER AN HOUR OF FRUITLESS SEARCH THEY FOUND HER FAST ASLEEP UNDER THAT TREE WHICH SHADES MY FATHER'S GRAVE HE WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND SAID WHEN HE TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS STILL SLEEPING
I'LL CRY ROBBERS THIEVES MURDER ALARM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD STRUGGLE WITH YOU LET LOOSE SOME BLOOD AND SWEAR YOU CAME TO ROB ME IF YOU DON'T QUIT MY HOUSE REPLIED GRIDE DRAWING IN HIS HEAD WITH A FRIGHTFUL GRIN I WILL WRETCH CRIED NICHOLAS
AND NOW YOU'RE UP MY SLIDER BAWLED SQUEERS AS SHE ROSE TO FETCH THEM BOLT THE DOOR PEG TROTTED TO THE DOOR AND AFTER FUMBLING AT THE BOLT CREPT TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
TO STATE THE REASONS FOR AND AGAINST
BY SOME FRAUD IT WAS ABSTRACTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DECEASE AND THE OTHER THE ONLY WILL FOUND WAS PROVED AND ADMINISTERED FRIENDLY NEGOTIATIONS WHICH HAVE ONLY JUST NOW TERMINATED HAVE BEEN PROCEEDING SINCE THIS INSTRUMENT CAME INTO OUR HANDS
OR FAILED TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE PURPOSE IF YOU MARRIED THIS GIRL WITHOUT ME SAID RALPH
AND THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN AT THE DOOR WHO WANTED TO SEE MISTER KENWIGS MOST PARTICULAR SHADOWY VISIONS OF HIS DISTINGUISHED RELATION FLITTED THROUGH THE BRAIN OF MISTER KENWIGS AS THIS MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED
YOU KNOW I HAVE STOOD BY WHEN YOU FAWNED AND FLATTERED OTHER PEOPLE AND I REMEMBER PRETTY WELL WHAT THAT ALWAYS LED TO HA HA HA REJOINED ARTHUR RUBBING HIS HANDS SO YOU DO SO YOU DO NO DOUBT NOT A MAN KNOWS IT BETTER
OLD ARTHUR GRIDE MOVED HIS LIPS BUT THEY ONLY FORMED AN UGLY SMILE AND WERE MOTIONLESS AGAIN YOU THINK SAID NICHOLAS THAT THE PRICE WOULD NOT BE PAID MISS BRAY HAS WEALTHY FRIENDS WHO WOULD COIN THEIR VERY HEARTS TO SAVE HER IN SUCH A STRAIT AS THIS
THIS TAUNT BROUGHT SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO THE FACE OF NICHOLAS THAT ARTHUR GRIDE PLAINLY APPREHENDED IT
THAT IS TO SAY THE COACH NOT THE TURBAN WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH THE TWO LADIES AND THEIR LUGGAGE INSIDE AND NEWMAN DESPITE ALL MISSUS NICKLEBY'S ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD BE HIS DEATH ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER THEY WENT INTO THE CITY
THESE WORDS THOUGH UTTERED IN A VERY LOUD KEY WERE ADDRESSED TO NOTHING BUT EMPTY AIR THE RECITAL OF HIS WRONGS HOWEVER SEEMED TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING NEWMAN NOGGS DESPERATE FOR HE FLATTENED HIS OLD HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND DRAWING ON THE EVERLASTING GLOVES
THAT HER SUITOR IS AN OLD MAN WHY HOW OFTEN DO MEN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE WHO HAVEN'T YOUR EXCUSE BUT HAVE ALL THE MEANS AND SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE WITHIN THEIR REACH HOW OFTEN DO THEY MARRY THEIR DAUGHTERS TO OLD MEN OR WORSE STILL TO YOUNG MEN WITHOUT HEADS OR HEARTS
AND SHE HAD PLANTED WITH HER OWN HANDS THERE WERE THE HEDGEROWS WHERE THE BROTHER AND SISTER HAD SO OFTEN GATHERED WILD FLOWERS TOGETHER AND THE GREEN FIELDS AND SHADY PATHS WHERE THEY HAD SO OFTEN STRAYED THERE WAS NOT A LANE OR BROOK OR COPSE OR COTTAGE NEAR
AND THAT WHETHER A LOAN WERE CONTRACTED ON THE MONDAY OR ON THE FRIDAY THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST SHOULD BE IN BOTH CASES THE SAME INDEED HE ARGUED AND WITH GREAT SHOW OF REASON THAT IT OUGHT TO BE RATHER MORE FOR ONE DAY THAN FOR FIVE
AND STILL IT WAS SHIVERING FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE MADE HIS WAY UPSTAIRS INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN LAST DISTURBED HE HAD MADE A KIND OF COMPACT WITH HIMSELF
YOU SAY WELL RETURNED NICHOLAS AT LENGTH AND COMFORT ME VERY MUCH DEAR FELLOW LET ME HEAR YOU SAY YOU ARE HAPPY IF YOU CAN I MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING FIRST I SHOULD NOT HAVE A SECRET FROM YOU
SEVERAL SLIGHT GESTURES ON THE PART OF THE INVALID SHOWED THAT THESE ARGUMENTS WERE NO MORE LOST UPON HIM THAN THE SMALLEST IOTA OF HIS DEMEANOUR WAS UPON RALPH WHAT IS IT NOW I SAY PURSUED THE WILY USURER OR WHAT HAS IT A CHANCE OF BEING
THAT HE WOULD NOT THINK OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNTIL HE GOT HOME HE WAS AT HOME NOW AND SUFFERED HIMSELF TO CONSIDER IT HIS OWN CHILD HIS OWN CHILD
AND KISSED EACH OTHER ON THE CHEEK NOW HE MURMURED I AM HAPPY HE FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER AND WAKING SMILED AS BEFORE THEN SPOKE OF BEAUTIFUL GARDENS WHICH HE SAID STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM
I SHOULDN'T WONDER THAT WOULD MAKE IT QUITE COMPLETE THAT WOULD QUITE WHEN HE HAD BECOME RESTORED TO HIS USUAL CONDITION BY THESE AND OTHER COMMENTS ON HIS APPROACHING TRIUMPH
HE CAN'T EVEN KEEP FROM BUSINESS WHILE WE'RE CHATTING OVER BYGONES OH DEAR DEAR WHAT A MAN IT IS WHICH OF THE BYGONES DO YOU WANT TO REVIVE SAID RALPH ONE OF THEM I KNOW OR YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM
BUT HE CAME DOWN AT NIGHT THROUGH THE SNOW TO THE INN WHERE I WAS STAYING IT WAS AFTER DINNER AND HE NEEDED LITTLE PERSUASION TO SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN A WARM CORNER
REJOINED RALPH DRILY I DIDN'T LIKE TO TROUBLE YOU WITH THAT BECAUSE I SUPPOSED YOUR INTEREST WOULD CEASE WITH YOUR OWN CONCERN IN THE AFFAIR SAID ARTHUR GRIDE
I'VE DONE IT ACCIDENTALLY DELIVERING THIS REPLY IN HIS ACCUSTOMED TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH OF COURSE IT WAS INAUDIBLE TO PEG MISTER SQUEERS DREW A STOOL TO THE FIRE AND PLACING HIMSELF OVER AGAINST HER
MEN LIKE YOU AND ASK WHAT MONEY WILL BUY YOU OFF REMEMBER THE DANGER TO WHICH YOU ARE EXPOSED YOU SEE I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW MUCH MORE WITH VERY LITTLE HELP BATE SOME EXPECTED GAIN FOR THE RISK YOU SAVE AND SAY WHAT IS YOUR PRICE
AND WANDERINGS AMONG SCENES WHERE OUR CHILDHOOD HAS BEEN PASSED USUALLY AWAKEN IN THE MOST INSENSIBLE MINDS TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF NICHOLAS AND RENDER HIM MORE THAN USUALLY MINDFUL OF HIS DROOPING FRIEND BY NIGHT AND DAY
AND LOOKING OFTEN OVER HIS SHOULDER WHILE HE HURRIED AWAY AS THOUGH HE WERE FOLLOWED IN IMAGINATION OR REALITY BY SOMEONE ANXIOUS TO QUESTION OR DETAIN HIM RALPH NICKLEBY LEFT THE CITY BEHIND HIM
A FOLLERING UP THIS HERE BLESSED OLD DOWAGER PETTY LARCENERER MISTER SQUEERS DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS EPITHET WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND EFFORT
AS NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER CHANCED TO HEAR THEIR NAMES BEFORE THE OLD BUTLER RECEIVED THEM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT AND MANY SMILES AND USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY THE BROTHERS WITH SO MUCH CORDIALITY AND KINDNESS
SAID HER FATHER GENTLY DISENGAGING HIMSELF IT WAS NOTHING
TRACED UPON IT BY THE WET AND DAMP WHICH HAD PENETRATED THROUGH THE ROOF BROKE INTO THE FOLLOWING SOLILOQUY
VANISHED INTO THE HOUSE AND WAS SEEN NO LONGER NOW CONSIDERED AS AN ABSTRACT CIRCUMSTANCE THERE WAS NO MORE OBVIOUS CAUSE OR REASON WHY MISTER KENWIGS SHOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MUFFLING THIS PARTICULAR KNOCKER
BUT THE BARE MEANS OF A MOST WRETCHED AND INADEQUATE SUBSISTENCE THERE WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THAT ONE TOWN DIVIDED INTO CLASSES NUMBERED AND ESTIMATED AS REGULARLY AS THE NOBLE FAMILIES AND FOLKS OF GREAT DEGREE
I'VE COME ACCORDING TO PROMISE ROARED SQUEERS SO THEY USED TO SAY IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY I COME FROM OBSERVED PEG COMPLACENTLY
IS ALL PHILOSOPHY TOGETHER THAT'S WHAT IT IS THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS PHILOSOPHY AND THE EARTHLY BODIES IS PHILOSOPHY IF THERE'S A SCREW LOOSE IN A HEAVENLY BODY THAT'S PHILOSOPHY
PEG HOBBLED OUT AFTER SHARPLY DEMANDING WHY HE HADN'T SAID THERE WAS A RING BEFORE INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT ALL MANNER OF THINGS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND KEEPING HER HALF PINT OF BEER WAITING ON THE STEPS
CHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT IN WHICH ONE SCENE OF THIS HISTORY IS CLOSED DIVIDING THE DISTANCE INTO TWO DAYS JOURNEY IN ORDER THAT HIS CHARGE MIGHT SUSTAIN THE LESS EXHAUSTION AND FATIGUE FROM TRAVELLING SO FAR
AND BEING GREATLY FATIGUED BOTH IN MIND AND BODY GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES FIVE MINUTES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SCREAM AND STARTING UP IN THAT KIND OF TERROR WHICH AFFECTS A PERSON SUDDENLY ROUSED
PEG DID AS SHE WAS BIDDEN AND WAITED FOR THE NEXT
ON WHICH HIS THOUGHTS WERE BENT HE FELT INDEED THAT THERE WAS LITTLE GROUND FOR HOPE AND LITTLE REASON WHY IT SHOULD NOT FORM AN ATOM IN THE HUGE AGGREGATE OF DISTRESS AND SORROW AND ADD ONE SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT UNIT TO SWELL THE GREAT AMOUNT
WHEREUPON THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ALREADY MENTIONED RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY INTO THE BEDROOM TO BEHOLD HIM IN THE ACT THE FACT IS RESUMED NICHOLAS
LORD MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY DON'T TALK IN THAT WAY OR YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ME TO DEATH IT IS ONLY MY FOOLISH FANCY MAMA SAID KATE FORCING A SMILE WELL THEN MY LOVE I WISH YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR FOOLISH FANCY TO YOURSELF
IF YOU DIED INDEED THE PEOPLE YOU HATE WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY BUT CAN YOU BEAR THE THOUGHT OF THAT NO RETURNED BRAY URGED BY A VINDICTIVE IMPULSE HE COULD NOT REPRESS I SHOULD IMAGINE NOT INDEED SAID RALPH QUIETLY
AND THEY IMPLORED HIM WITH MUCH FEELING TO GO QUIETLY TO BED THE ATTENTION SAID MISTER KENWIGS LOOKING AROUND WITH A PLAINTIVE AIR THE ATTENTION THAT I'VE SHOWN TO THAT MAN
AND BURN IT IN LITTLE
IT WILL SELDOM ADMIT A VERY STRONGLY MARKED CHARACTER EITHER GOOD OR BAD IN A FICTITIOUS NARRATIVE TO BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PROBABILITY BUT THOSE WHO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS TALE WILL BE GLAD TO LEARN THAT THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE LIVE
THAT GETS THEMSELVES INTO DIFFICULTIES BY BEING TOO NIMBLE WITH THEIR FINGERS I'M MISTER SQUEERS'S CATALOGUE OF HIS OWN MERITS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WAS PARTLY THE RESULT OF A CONCERTED PLAN BETWEEN HIMSELF AND RALPH NICKLEBY
AND SEEMS AS IF SOME BLIGHT HAD FALLEN ON IT IF I WERE SUPERSTITIOUS I SHOULD BE ALMOST INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT SOME DREADFUL CRIME HAD BEEN PERPETRATED WITHIN THESE OLD WALLS AND THAT THE PLACE HAD NEVER PROSPERED SINCE HOW FROWNING AND HOW DARK IT LOOKS
WHERE I UNDERSTOOD THE SCHOOLS TO BE MOST PLENTIFULLY SPRINKLED AND HAD NO OCCASION TO DELIVER A LETTER UNTIL I CAME TO A CERTAIN TOWN WHICH SHALL BE NAMELESS THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED WAS NOT AT HOME
AND WERE BLIND TO THE SPIRIT WHICH REIGNED WITHIN EVINCED A FANTASTIC KIND OF WARMTH CERTAINLY BUT NOT EXACTLY THAT KIND OF WARMTH OF FEELING WHICH THE CONTEMPLATION OF VIRTUE USUALLY INSPIRES MADELINE
AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS ALWAYS WATCHFUL ATTENTIVE AND SOLICITOUS AND NEVER VARYING IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS SELF IMPOSED DUTY TO ONE SO FRIENDLESS AND HELPLESS AS HE WHOSE SANDS OF LIFE WERE NOW FAST RUNNING OUT
IT'S A VERY SMALL PROPERTY IT IS INDEED SAY THE TEN SHILLINGS AND WE'LL CLOSE THE BARGAIN IT'S MORE THAN I OUGHT TO GIVE BUT YOU'RE SO KIND SHALL WE SAY THE TEN DO NOW DO
AND THE PUBLISHED SKETCH DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE IN ANY OTHER RESPECT STILL HE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS KNOW AT ONCE FOR WHOM IT IS MEANT BECAUSE THE CHARACTER IS SO LIKE HIM
WHETHER OR NO HE HAD CLEARLY NO KEY TO THE MYSTERY AND COULD NOT HURT HIM WHO KEPT IT CLOSE WITHIN HIS OWN BREAST THE ALLUSION TO FRIENDS AND THE OFFER OF MONEY GRIDE HELD
PRECISELY WHAT MADE ME CONSIDER THE THING SO FAIR AND EASY THERE IS NO OBLIGATION ON EITHER SIDE YOU HAVE MONEY AND MISS MADELINE HAS BEAUTY AND WORTH SHE HAS YOUTH YOU HAVE MONEY SHE HAS NOT MONEY YOU HAVE NOT YOUTH
HAD EACH A BELL OF ITS OWN AS TO THE ATTICS NO ONE EVER CALLED ON THEM IF ANYBODY WANTED THE PARLOURS THEY WERE CLOSE AT HAND
SAW TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT THAT HIS CHARGE HAD STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND WITH EYES ALMOST STARTING FROM THEIR SOCKETS COLD DEW STANDING ON HIS FOREHEAD AND IN A FIT OF TREMBLING WHICH QUITE CONVULSED HIS FRAME
CAME GRADUALLY BUT SLOWLY TO HIMSELF AND THAT WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO WHAT HAD JUST OCCURRED AS THOUGH HE HAD NO DISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF IT AS YET HE REQUESTED TO BE LEFT ALONE
WHILE THE AUTHOR CANNOT BUT FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE COMPLIMENT THUS CONVEYED TO HIM HE VENTURES TO SUGGEST THAT THESE CONTENTIONS MAY ARISE FROM THE FACT THAT MISTER SQUEERS IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CLASS AND NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL
AND SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE A VERY RED FACE INDEED PERHAPS SHE DRANK SUGGESTED MISS LA CREEVY I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RETURNED MISSUS NICKLEBY BUT I KNOW SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE
IT WAS ON SUCH OCCASIONS AS THESE THAT NICHOLAS YIELDING ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE INTEREST OF OLD ASSOCIATIONS WOULD POINT OUT SOME TREE THAT HE HAD CLIMBED A HUNDRED TIMES TO PEEP AT THE YOUNG BIRDS IN THEIR NEST
IF SHE PROFITS BY ANYBODY'S DEATH THIS WAS SAID IN A LOWER TONE LET IT BE BY HER HUSBAND'S DON'T LET HER HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO YOURS AS THE EVENT FROM WHICH TO DATE A HAPPIER LIFE WHERE IS THE OBJECTION LET ME HEAR IT STATED WHAT IS IT
WHO COULD SCARCELY GO ASTRAY BE THEY VICIOUS AS THEY WOULD TURNED HAUGHTILY FROM THE CRUSHED AND STRICKEN WRETCH WHO COULD SCARCE DO OTHERWISE AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER WONDER HAD HE OR SHE DONE WELL THAN EVEN THEY HAD THEY DONE ILL
AS ILLUSTRATING THE SECRET CONNECTION AND SYMPATHY WHICH ALWAYS EXIST BETWEEN GREAT MINDS THOUGH MASTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS NOT AT THAT TIME AWARE OF IT THE CLASS OF GENTLEMEN BEFORE ALLUDED TO PROCEED ON JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN ALL THEIR TRANSACTIONS
AND WHO SEEMED TO CONSIDER IT ONE OF THE BEST JOKES EVER LAUNCHED UPON SOCIETY
THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
THAT WAS LYING AT MY FEET ON LOOKING UP I BEHELD HIM STANDING ABOUT TWO YARDS OFF WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYES WISTFULLY GAZING ON THE DOG TRANSFIXED TO THE SPOT
MAMMA SENDS ALL HER PICTURES TO LONDON SAID ARTHUR AND SOMEBODY SELLS THEM FOR HER THERE AND SENDS US THE MONEY IN LOOKING ROUND UPON THE OTHER PIECES I REMARKED A PRETTY SKETCH OF LINDEN HOPE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
SAID I OBSERVING HER RISE AND BEGIN TO TAKE LEAVE OF MY MOTHER YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY WORDS AS YOU PLEASE ONLY I CAN'T STAY TO HEAR THEM NO THAT IS THE WAY YOU HEAR JUST AS MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT AS YOU PLEASE AND THE REST MAY BE SPOKEN TO THE WIND
AND WELL CONDUCTED TOWARDS LADY LOWBOROUGH THE FIRST DAY HE HELD HIMSELF ALOOF FROM HER AS FAR AS HE COULD WITHOUT ANY FLAGRANT BREACH OF HOSPITALITY SINCE THAT HE HAS BEEN FRIENDLY AND CIVIL
THEY WON'T REFUSE ME IF YOU DON'T I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT MY AUNT DISLIKES YOU BUT YOU DON'T HELEN SAY YOU LOVE ME AND I'LL GO I WISH YOU WOULD GO I REPLIED
WHAT IS THE MATTER I COULD NOT ANSWER AT THE MOMENT YOU MUST AND SHALL TELL ME WAS ADDED MORE VEHEMENTLY AND THE SPEAKER THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
THE AIR WAS SIMPLE SWEET AND SAD IT IS STILL RUNNING IN MY HEAD AND SO ARE THE WORDS FAREWELL TO THEE BUT NOT FAREWELL TO ALL MY FONDEST THOUGHTS OF THEE
I DON'T WONDER AT YOUR BEING ANGRY FOR I'M SURE I'D GIVE MY HUSBAND A LESSON HE WOULD NOT SOON FORGET FOR A LIGHTER OFFENCE THAN THAT BUT THEN
AND REQUIRE NO EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS TO TEACH THEM THE EVIL OF TRANSGRESSION I WOULD NOT SEND A POOR GIRL INTO THE WORLD UNARMED AGAINST HER FOES AND IGNORANT OF THE SNARES THAT BESET HER PATH
APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN THE PERUSAL OF A VOLUME OF THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE
TO PRESUME TO LOOK AT A PICTURE THAT THE ARTIST HAS TURNED TO THE WALL BUT MAY I ASK
HE REPEATED MORE VEHEMENTLY
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
WHAT SO BITTER HE EXCLAIMED LAUGHINGLY
AND WHAT WILL BE THE END OF IT I CANNOT CALMLY REFLECT UPON IT I CANNOT SLEEP I MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO MY DIARY AGAIN I WILL COMMIT IT TO PAPER TO NIGHT
BUT YOU HAVE A SERVANT SAID ROSE COULD YOU NOT LEAVE HIM WITH HER SHE HAS HER OWN OCCUPATIONS TO ATTEND TO
BUT I SNATCHED IT AWAY IN INDIGNATION ALMOST IN DISGUST FOR HE WAS OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED WITH WINE THEN I MUST GO DOWN ON MY KNEES SAID HE
AND HE STOOD LEANING ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR CONVERSING IN SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONES WITH HIS FACE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH HERS I LOOKED AT LORD LOWBOROUGH
BY THAT MEANS I HOPE TO SAVE HIM FROM ONE DEGRADING VICE AT LEAST I WISH I COULD RENDER THE INCENTIVES TO EVERY OTHER EQUALLY INNOXIOUS IN HIS CASE BUT BY SUCH MEANS SAID I YOU WILL NEVER RENDER HIM VIRTUOUS
YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD WILL YOU BESTOW YOURSELF UPON ME YOU WILL HE CRIED NEARLY SQUEEZING ME TO DEATH IN HIS ARMS NO NO I EXCLAIMED STRUGGLING TO FREE MYSELF FROM HIM
REPLIED SHE AS SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ROSE YOU MUST BRING YOUR SISTER TO SEE ME SOME FINE DAY AND I'LL LISTEN AS PATIENTLY AS YOU COULD WISH TO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO SAY
IT IS THIS RESUMED HE THAT ANNABELLA WILMOT IN COMPARISON WITH YOU IS LIKE A FLAUNTING PEONY COMPARED WITH A SWEET WILD ROSEBUD GEMMED WITH DEW AND I LOVE YOU
MISSUS HARGRAVE'S ANXIETY TO MAKE GOOD MATCHES FOR HER DAUGHTERS IS PARTLY THE CAUSE AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF THESE ERRORS BY MAKING A FIGURE IN THE WORLD
AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
OR MADE HIM SENSIBLE OF THE WRONG IF IT HAD ONLY ARISEN FROM THOUGHTLESSNESS BUT I FELT IT TOO DEEPLY TO DO ANYTHING BUT RISE FROM THE MUSIC STOOL AND THROW MYSELF BACK ON THE SOFA SUPPRESSING WITH DIFFICULTY
THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
SAID I AND LISTEN TO ME AND DON'T THINK I'M IN A JEALOUS FURY I AM PERFECTLY CALM FEEL MY HAND AND I GRAVELY EXTENDED IT TOWARDS HIM
AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
AND REMEMBER THAT I AM A POOR FALLIBLE MORTAL COME NOW HELEN WON'T YOU FORGIVE ME HE SAID GENTLY TAKING MY HAND AND LOOKING UP WITH AN INNOCENT SMILE
FOR I NEVER LEAVE HIM ALONE AND I THINK MISSUS MARKHAM I MUST BEG YOU TO MAKE MY EXCUSES TO THE MILLWARDS AND MISSUS WILSON WHEN YOU SEE THEM AS I FEAR I CANNOT DO MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF CALLING UPON THEM
THE BLOOD RUSHED FIRST TO MY HEART AND THEN TO MY HEAD FOR THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS ALMOST AT THE MOMENT OF MY APPROACH HE CAST A HURRIED GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER
TO DISTRACTION NOW TELL ME IF THAT INTELLIGENCE GIVES YOU ANY PLEASURE SILENCE AGAIN THAT MEANS YES THEN LET ME ADD THAT I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU
AND MAKES THEM BURDENS ON HER HANDS POOR MILICENT I FEAR HAS ALREADY FALLEN A SACRIFICE TO THE MANOEUVRINGS OF THIS MISTAKEN MOTHER WHO CONGRATULATES HERSELF ON HAVING SO SATISFACTORILY DISCHARGED
BUT WHICH SAID HE
IS IT THAT YOU THINK SHE HAS NO VIRTUE ASSUREDLY NOT WELL BUT YOU AFFIRM THAT VIRTUE IS ONLY ELICITED BY TEMPTATION AND YOU THINK THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION OR TOO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH VICE
BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
HAD I BEEN ENDOWED WITH A PROPER DEGREE OF SELF POSSESSION I SHOULD HAVE TURNED TO THE LADY MYSELF AND CHEERFULLY JOINED MY ENTREATIES TO HIS WHEREBY I SHOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED HIS EXPECTATIONS IF THE AFFRONT HAD BEEN PURPOSELY GIVEN
INTIMATE THAT THE OWNER THEREOF WAS PROUDER OF HIS BEAUTY THAN HIS INTELLECT AS PERHAPS HE HAD REASON TO BE AND YET HE LOOKED NO FOOL I HAD NOT HAD THE PORTRAIT IN MY HANDS TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE FAIR ARTIST RETURNED
WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
THE MAGIC OF WHOSE TONE CAN WAKE AN ECHO IN MY BREAST CREATING FEELINGS THAT ALONE
AND A DULL BECLOUDED SKY ABOVE YOU SEE THERE IS A SAD DEARTH OF SUBJECTS OBSERVED THE FAIR ARTIST I TOOK THE OLD HALL ONCE ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND I SUPPOSE I MUST TAKE IT AGAIN ON A SNOWY WINTER'S DAY
TO TEACH HER HOW TO SIN IS AT ONCE TO MAKE HER A SINNER AND THE GREATER HER KNOWLEDGE THE WIDER HER LIBERTY THE DEEPER WILL BE HER DEPRAVITY WHEREAS IN THE NOBLER SEX THERE IS A NATURAL TENDENCY TO GOODNESS
AND CONSTRUING YOUR SILENCE INTO YES I'LL TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT I WAS THE SUBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND THE CAUSE OF YOUR AFFLICTION INDEED SIR IF YOU DENY IT I WON'T TELL YOU MY SECRET THREATENED HE
SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
LET ME COMMEND MY CAUSE TO YOUR MOST INDULGENT NO INDULGENCE FOR YOU MISTER HUNTINGDON MUST COME BETWEEN ME AND THE CONSIDERATION OF MY NIECE'S HAPPINESS AH TRUE I KNOW SHE IS AN ANGEL
MISS WILMOT NEVER LIKES TO WASTE HER MUSICAL EFFORTS ON LADIES EARS ALONE MILICENT HAD ASKED FOR A LITTLE SCOTCH SONG AND I WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHEN THEY ENTERED
AND WON BY LADY LOWBOROUGH NO HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS THAT I THINK HER MERE DUST AND ASHES IN COMPARISON WITH YOU AND SHALL CONTINUE TO THINK SO
I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
BUT IMMEDIATELY I WAS SENSIBLE OF HAVING COMMITTED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE IN SO DOING FOR SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE FRANKNESS SHE REPLIED BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS
THAT ANNABELLA HAD BEEN SINGING AND PLAYING WITH ARTHUR AS USUAL AT HER SIDE SHE HAD ENDED HER SONG
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
THE WARMLY TINTED CHEEKS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF REDDISH WHISKERS WHILE THE BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR CLUSTERING IN ABUNDANT WAVY CURLS TRESPASSED TOO MUCH UPON THE FOREHEAD AND SEEMED TO
HE NEVER WILL DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND FOR I KEEP HIM IN TOO GOOD ORDER FOR THAT ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T ARROGATE TOO MUCH OF THE CREDIT TO YOURSELF LORD LOWBOROUGH WAS QUITE AS REMARKABLE
IT IS OBVIOUSLY THEREFORE MY INTEREST TO DISAPPOINT THEM BOTH AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BY PRESERVING A CHEERFUL UNDISTURBED SERENITY THROUGHOUT AND ACCORDINGLY I ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HUSBAND
CONFOUNDED AND DISMAYED SHE SAW ME TOO AND CONFRONTED ME WITH A LOOK OF HARD DEFIANCE I LAID THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO AND RETIRED I FELT ILL
THAN TO ANYTHING ELSE NO REPLIED I AND NEVER WILL BE SO AGAIN I TRUST YOU GAVE HIM A CURTAIN LECTURE DID YOU NO
YOU HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED YOUR PAINTING SAID I APPROACHING TO OBSERVE IT MORE CLOSELY AND SURVEYING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT THAN I CARED TO EXPRESS
AND I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE HIM OF HIS MISTAKE SO FROM THAT TIME I HAVE CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM ANY NOTICE OF THE SUBJECT WHATEVER
YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ACQUAINTANCES AT LEAST IN THE WORLD FROM WHOM I DESIRE MY PRESENT ABODE TO BE CONCEALED AND AS THEY MIGHT SEE THE PICTURE AND MIGHT POSSIBLY RECOGNISE THE STYLE IN SPITE OF THE FALSE INITIALS I HAVE PUT IN THE CORNER
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LESS REMORSE IN TELLING YOU AT THE END OF THE DISCOURSE THAT I PRESERVE MY OWN OPINION PRECISELY THE SAME AS AT THE BEGINNING AS WOULD BE THE CASE I AM PERSUADED WITH REGARD TO EITHER LOGICIAN
FOR HIS ABSTEMIOUSNESS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE YOU MARRIED HIM AS HE IS NOW I HAVE HEARD OH ABOUT THE WINE YOU MEAN YES
THAT HAVE REQUIRED ON MANY OCCASIONS MORE WATCHFULNESS AND FIRMNESS TO RESIST THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER AGAINST THEM AND THIS I BELIEVE IS WHAT MOST OTHERS WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REFLECTION
WHISPERED ROSE THE CHILD LOOKED AT HER IN GRAVE SURPRISE SHE STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM ON INDIFFERENT MATTERS WHILE I AMUSED MYSELF WITH LOOKING AT THE PICTURES THERE WAS ONE IN AN OBSCURE CORNER THAT I HAD NOT BEFORE OBSERVED
WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND IF NOT I'LL GO GO THEN I CRIED BUT FEARING HE WOULD OBEY TOO WELL AND NEVER COME AGAIN I HASTILY ADDED
I WAS NATURALLY TOUCHY OR IT WOULD NOT HAVE VEXED ME SO MUCH
BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
AND I THOUGHT IT MUST BE INFINITELY MORE SO TO HER BUT IT SEEMS I WAS MISTAKEN SHE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND SMILING WITH THE COOLEST ASSURANCE SHE BEGAN
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
AND I WAS SCARCELY MYSELF AT THE TIME YOU OFTEN TAKE TOO MUCH AND THAT IS ANOTHER PRACTICE I DETEST HE LOOKED UP ASTONISHED AT MY WARMTH YES I CONTINUED
MY AUNT OPENED WIDE THE DOOR AND STOOD BEFORE US CANDLE IN HAND IN SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED AMAZEMENT GAZING ALTERNATELY AT MISTER HUNTINGDON AND ME FOR WE HAD BOTH STARTED UP
REPLIED SHE ATTEMPTING TO COVER THE TARTNESS OF HER REBUKE WITH A SMILE
THAT'S OUR GRAND RESOURCE YOU KNOW BUT DOESN'T IT MAKE YOUR EYES SMART AND DO YOU ALWAYS FIND IT TO ANSWER I NEVER CRY FOR EFFECT NOR CAN I CONCEIVE HOW ANY ONE CAN
MUCH THE SAME FEELINGS OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SADNESS AS I DID BUT THE LOOK SHE GAVE HIM PLAINLY SAID DO YOU CHOOSE FOR ME NOW I HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND WILL GLADLY EXERT MYSELF TO GRATIFY YOU
COME HERE YOU ARE TROUBLESOME TO MISTER MARKHAM HE WISHES TO READ BY NO MEANS MISSUS GRAHAM PRAY LET HIM STAY I AM AS MUCH AMUSED AS HE IS PLEADED I BUT STILL WITH HAND AND EYE SHE SILENTLY CALLED HIM TO HER SIDE
AND PERHAPS TO TORMENT HIS FRIEND
WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
BORE SUFFICIENT RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME TO PROCLAIM IT A PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR GRAHAM IN HIS EARLY INFANCY IN TAKING THIS UP TO BRING IT TO THE LIGHT I DISCOVERED ANOTHER BEHIND IT WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
AND MY DEAR MISSUS GRAHAM LET ME WARN YOU IN GOOD TIME AGAINST THE ERROR THE FATAL ERROR I MAY CALL IT OF TAKING THAT BOY'S EDUCATION UPON YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE CLEVER IN SOME THINGS AND WELL INFORMED YOU MAY FANCY YOURSELF EQUAL TO THE TASK
WHAT FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN MORE VALOROUSLY DERIDED THAN THE DOCTRINE OF INFANT RESPECTABILITY RIGHT
SO PROSPERS STILL THE DIPLOMATIC ART AND SATAN BOWS WITH HAND UPON HIS HEART

YES A GENUINE WIFE AND THE VICTIM WAS A GENUINE BROTHER IN LAW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A DOMESTIC DRAMA THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LAUGHED A LITTLE BUT THE GREAT MAN'S THOUGHTS SEEMED TO HAVE WANDERED FAR AWAY
THE PATRONESS OF THE EX CONVICT RECEIVED THIS ASSURANCE INDIGNANTLY WHY WERE YOUR PEOPLE STUPID ENOUGH TO CONNECT HIM WITH NOT STUPID INTERRUPTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CONTRADICTING DEFERENTIALLY
IT'S HIS NERVES THAT I AM AFRAID OF THE REACTIONARY GANG WITH THAT ABUSIVE BRUTE CHEESEMAN AT THEIR HEAD INSULT HIM EVERY NIGHT IF HE WILL INSIST ON BEGINNING A REVOLUTION MURMURED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE TIME HAS COME
ALREADY MISSUS VERLOC WAS REGRETTING HER WORDS THEY HAD SOUNDED MORE UNKIND THAN SHE MEANT THEM TO BE THEY HAD ALSO THE UNWISDOM OF UNNECESSARY THINGS IN FACT SHE HAD NOT MEANT THEM AT ALL
THE POLICEMAN ON THE BEAT PROJECTED HIS SOMBRE AND MOVING FORM AGAINST THE LUMINOUS GLORY OF ORANGES AND LEMONS AND ENTERED BRETT STREET WITHOUT HASTE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AS THOUGH HE WERE A MEMBER OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
DRAW THE MONEY OUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALL OF IT YES ALL OF IT MISSUS VERLOC SPREAD OUT WITH CARE THE SCANTY TABLE CLOTH GOT TWO KNIVES AND TWO FORKS OUT OF THE TABLE DRAWER AND SUDDENLY STOPPED IN HER METHODICAL PROCEEDINGS
SAID INDIFFERENTLY THERE'S A PRACTICAL SIDE TOO WE HAVE REALLY ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER THE GENUINE ARTICLE YOU CAN'T SAY WE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE
IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
YOU'VE A BAD COLD IT WAS INDEED OBVIOUS THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS NOT IN HIS USUAL STATE PHYSICALLY AND EVEN MENTALLY A SOMBRE IRRESOLUTION HELD HIM SILENT FOR A WHILE
WITH AN UNEXPECTED DEPTH OF FEELING EIGHTEEN STONE I SHOULD SAY AND NOT FIVE FOOT SIX POOR FELLOW IT'S TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE GAZING ABSENTLY AT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
THE CRAWLING APPROACH OF A HANSOM HE GAVE NO SIGN BUT WHEN THE LOW STEP GLIDING ALONG THE CURBSTONE CAME TO HIS FEET HE DODGED IN SKILFULLY IN FRONT OF THE BIG TURNING WHEEL AND SPOKE UP THROUGH THE LITTLE TRAP DOOR
AND RECALLING THE PROFESSOR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITHOUT CHECKING HIS SWINGING PACE MUTTERED THROUGH HIS TEETH LUNATIC CATCHING THIEVES WAS ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER KNEW THE LADY YOU DO NOT LOOK FRIGHTENED HE PRONOUNCED AFTER SURVEYING HER CONSCIENTIOUSLY WITH HIS TIRED AND EQUABLE GAZE HE WAS THINKING MEANTIME TO HIMSELF THAT IN THIS HOUSE
MADE IT APPEAR UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MEANT TO STRANGLE OR TO EMBRACE HIS WIFE BUT MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY FROM THAT MANIFESTATION BY THE CLATTER OF THE SHOP BELL SHOP ADOLF YOU GO HE STOPPED
OF EVIL FREEDOM IT WAS RATHER PLEASANT WHEN AFTER PAYING FOR HIS SHORT MEAL HE STOOD UP AND WAITED FOR HIS CHANGE HE SAW HIMSELF IN THE SHEET OF GLASS AND WAS STRUCK
WHATEVER DID YOU WANT TO DO THAT FOR SHE EXCLAIMED IN SCANDALISED ASTONISHMENT THE SHOCK MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE TO MAKE HER DEPART FROM THAT DISTANT AND UNINQUIRING ACCEPTANCE OF FACTS
AT HER MOTIONLESS HUSBAND HUGGING THE FIRE SHE WENT DOWN TWO STEPS INTO THE KITCHEN IT WAS ONLY WHEN COMING BACK CARVING KNIFE AND FORK IN HAND
HE'S BEEN FRIGHTENING ME DECLARED SUDDENLY THE LADY WHO SAT BY THE SIDE OF MISTER VLADIMIR
GLISTENED WITH AN EFFECT OF PHOSPHORESCENCE AND WHEN HE EMERGED INTO THE STRAND OUT OF A NARROW STREET BY THE SIDE OF CHARING CROSS STATION THE GENIUS OF THE LOCALITY ASSIMILATED HIM HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT ONE MORE OF THE QUEER FOREIGN FISH
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PAUSED IN HIS SPECULATIONS TO REFLECT FOR A MOMENT THOUGH HOW IN THAT LAST CASE HE COULD HOPE TO HAVE HIS OWN SHARE IN THE BUSINESS CONCEALED IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL HE CONTINUED IN HIS IGNORANCE OF POOR STEVIE'S DEVOTION TO MISTER VERLOC
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW YOURSELVES YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING BY IT MEANTIME IT'S YOU WHO GET SOMETHING FROM IT SO FAR AND YOU GET IT EASILY TOO I WON'T SPEAK OF YOUR SALARY
FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT DAY MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED HE STARED STUPIDLY AT HIS WIFE SHE CONTINUED IN HER STEADY MANNER THE BOY WHENEVER HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING MOPED IN THE HOUSE
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
STEPPED OUT WITH THE PURPOSEFUL BRISKNESS OF A MAN DISREGARDING INDEED THE INCLEMENCIES OF THE WEATHER BUT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING AN AUTHORISED MISSION ON THIS EARTH AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF HIS KIND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE IMMENSE TOWN
A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY OF THOUGHT IS COMMON TO SERENE SOULS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE SOCIAL SCALE THE GREAT LADY WAS SIMPLE IN HER OWN WAY HIS VIEWS AND BELIEFS HAD NOTHING IN THEM TO SHOCK OR STARTLE HER
HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS FACE RED HIS FINGERS HAD RUFFLED HIS HAIR INTO A DISSIPATED UNTIDINESS ALTOGETHER HE HAD A DISREPUTABLE ASPECT EXPRESSIVE OF THE DISCOMFORT THE IRRITATION
INSPIRED BY THE SIMILARITY OF WEARING APPAREL MISSUS VERLOC GAVE REIN TO HER FANCY MIGHT BE FATHER AND SON SHE SAID TO HERSELF SHE THOUGHT ALSO THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS AS MUCH OF A FATHER AS POOR STEVIE EVER HAD IN HIS LIFE
THEN BY SUDDEN INSPIRATION RAISED THE COLLAR OF HIS JACKET THIS ARRANGEMENT APPEARED TO HIM COMMENDABLE
HE HAD MADE THAT STATEMENT WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE HIGH OFFICIAL DESIRED GREATLY TO HEAR THAT VERY THING
THE LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE OF HUMANITARIAN HOPES WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND DISTINGUISHED CONNECTIONS OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S WIFE WHOM SHE CALLED ANNIE
BUT NOT SO KINDLY AS IF HE WERE CONDESCENDING TO GIVE GOOD ADVICE TO A CRACKSMAN OF REPUTE GIVE IT UP YOU'LL FIND WE ARE TOO MANY FOR YOU THE FIXED SMILE ON THE PROFESSOR'S LIPS WAVERED
HALF CONCEALING WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCUMULATION OF RAW MATERIAL FOR A CANNIBAL FEAST IT REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE FIRMNESS OF MIND NOT TO RECOIL BEFORE THAT SIGHT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT AN EFFICIENT OFFICER OF HIS DEPARTMENT
FEEL AN IRRESISTIBLE NEED OF CONFESSING OF MAKING A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO SOMEBODY TO ANYBODY AND THEY DO IT OFTEN TO THE POLICE IN THAT VERLOC WHOM HEAT WISHED SO MUCH TO SCREEN I'VE FOUND A MAN IN THAT PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
LET ESCAPE ON THE PAVEMENT A NARROW CLEAR STREAK OF GAS LIGHT WITHIN BEHIND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE VAN AND HORSES MERGED INTO ONE MASS SEEMED SOMETHING ALIVE
IT'S IN CONNECTION WITH THAT GREENWICH AFFAIR OH I SAY HE'S VERY BITTER AGAINST YOU PEOPLE BUT I WILL GO AND SEE IF YOU INSIST DO THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
WHAT PLEASED ME MOST IN THIS AFFAIR THE ASSISTANT WENT ON TALKING SLOWLY
NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE FACT REMAINS THE ADDRESS ON HIS CLOTHING DISCOVERED BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT TOO IT IS AN INCREDIBLE LITTLE FACT SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE EXPLANATION WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT IS BOUND TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
AND IN THEIR OWN WAY THE MOST ARDENT OF REVOLUTIONARIES ARE PERHAPS DOING NO MORE BUT SEEKING FOR PEACE IN COMMON WITH THE REST OF MANKIND THE PEACE OF SOOTHED VANITY OF SATISFIED APPETITES
AND HE IS THE ONLY MAN GREAT ENOUGH FOR THE WORK PROTESTED THE REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES FLARING UP UNDER THE CALM SPECULATIVE GAZE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SOMEWHERE IN A CORRIDOR A DISTANT BELL TINKLED URGENTLY
THOUGH INDEED THE LAD HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIM TEMPORARILY IN THE COUNTRY UP TO EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT MICHAELIS KNOWS NOTHING OF IT TO THIS MOMENT YOU ARE POSITIVE AS TO THAT ASKED THE GREAT MAN QUITE CERTAIN SIR ETHELRED
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN SHAMBLES AND RAG SHOPS YOU USED A SHOVEL HE REMARKED OBSERVING A SPRINKLING OF SMALL GRAVEL TINY BROWN BITS OF BARK
WE CAN'T PUT UP WITH THE INNOCENCE OF NASTY LITTLE CHILDREN SAID THE GREAT AND EXPANDED PERSONAGE EXPANDING A LITTLE MORE AS IT WERE
ENORMOUS HE STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG IN BIG ROOMY BOOTS AND UTTERED NO WORD OF GREETING
SHOOK HIM ALL OVER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS LED TO ADD AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT NOT YET WHEN I WANT YOU I WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU
HAD DONE NO WEAVING DURING HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE
TILL HE EVOLVED A HORRIBLE NOTION THAT AGES OF ATROCIOUS PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE COULD BE CONTAINED BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE WINKS OF AN EYE AND MEANTIME THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WENT ON PEERING AT THE TABLE WITH A CALM FACE
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ENTERING SAW AT FIRST ONLY A BIG PALE HAND SUPPORTING A BIG HEAD AND CONCEALING THE UPPER PART OF A BIG PALE FACE AN OPEN DESPATCH BOX STOOD ON THE WRITING TABLE NEAR A FEW OBLONG SHEETS OF PAPER
TO DESTROY PUBLIC FAITH IN LEGALITY WAS THE IMPERFECT FORMULA OF HIS PEDANTIC FANATICISM BUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS CONVICTION THAT THE FRAMEWORK OF AN ESTABLISHED SOCIAL ORDER CANNOT BE EFFECTUALLY SHATTERED
MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER HAD AT LAST SECURED HER ADMISSION TO CERTAIN ALMSHOUSES FOUNDED BY A WEALTHY INNKEEPER FOR THE DESTITUTE WIDOWS OF THE TRADE THIS END
HE SAW NONE A COUPLE OF CARRIAGES WAITED BY THE CURBSTONE THEIR LAMPS BLAZING STEADILY THE HORSES STANDING PERFECTLY STILL AS IF CARVED IN STONE
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE DISPOSAL OF A FEW TABLES AND CHAIRS BRASS BEDSTEADS AND SO ON MAY BE BIG WITH REMOTE AND DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES SHE REQUIRED A FEW PIECES HERSELF
YOU DID BUT THE FELLOW WILL DISAPPEAR PARDON ME I DON'T THINK SO WHERE COULD HE GO TO MOREOVER YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HE HAS GOT TO THINK OF THE DANGER FROM HIS COMRADES TOO HE'S THERE AT HIS POST
SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I NEVER HOPED TO SEE YOU HERE TO NIGHT ANNIE TOLD ME YES I HAD NO IDEA MYSELF THAT MY WORK WOULD BE OVER SO SOON
THEN LEFT HER SEAT TO GO AND PEEP THROUGH THE GLAZED DOOR SUDDENLY SHE OPENED IT AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE PARLOUR MISTER VERLOC HAD DONE NO MORE THAN PUT ON HIS OVERCOAT
BUT SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN WINNIE WAS PROVIDED FOR BY HER SENSIBLE UNION WITH THAT EXCELLENT HUSBAND MISTER VERLOC STEVIE WAS DESTITUTE AND A LITTLE PECULIAR
MUTTERED THE PROUD HEAD OF SIR ETHELRED FROM ITS LOFTY ELEVATION I AM AFRAID SO WITH AN INDIGNATION AND DISGUST OF WHICH YOU OR I CAN HAVE NO IDEA HE'S AN EXCELLENT SERVANT WE MUST NOT PUT AN UNDUE STRAIN ON HIS LOYALTY
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER BEGAN WITH A CALM AND UNTROUBLED ASSURANCE WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING THE HANDS ON THE FACE OF THE CLOCK BEHIND THE GREAT MAN'S BACK A HEAVY GLISTENING AFFAIR OF MASSIVE SCROLLS IN THE SAME DARK MARBLE AS THE MANTELPIECE
AND WITH SOMETHING OF A CHILD'S CHARM THE APPEALING CHARM OF TRUSTFULNESS CONFIDENT OF THE FUTURE WHOSE SECRET WAYS HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF A WELL KNOWN PENITENTIARY HE HAD NO REASON TO LOOK WITH SUSPICION UPON ANYBODY
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING WITH THAT BOY ADOLF MISSUS VERLOC SAID WITH HER BEST AIR OF INFLEXIBLE CALMNESS HE WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU HE SHE PAUSED ATTENTIVE HER EAR TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN
WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE PANGS OF INCONCEIVABLE AGONY NO PHYSIOLOGIST AND STILL LESS OF A METAPHYSICIAN CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ROSE BY THE FORCE OF SYMPATHY WHICH IS A FORM OF FEAR ABOVE THE VULGAR CONCEPTION OF TIME
AND BRINGING IN HER BROTHER STEVIE AS SOON AS SHE COULD INTO THE CURRENT OF DOMESTIC EVENTS SHE MENTIONED THAT THE BOY HAD MOPED A GOOD DEAL IT'S ALL ALONG OF MOTHER LEAVING US LIKE THIS MISTER VERLOC NEITHER SAID DAMN
HIS FACE AVERTED FROM THE ROOM EXPRESSED A STARTLED INTENSE INTEREST WHILE HE EXAMINED CLOSELY THE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF BROAD CLOTH BY A SUDDEN JERK HE DETACHED IT
THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A BURGLAR ARE OF THE SAME KIND AS THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A POLICE OFFICER BOTH RECOGNISE THE SAME CONVENTIONS AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S METHODS AND OF THE ROUTINE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADES
INTERRUPTED THE DOMESTIC OCCUPATION SHE WAS ENGAGED UPON IT WAS THE DUSTING OF THE FURNITURE IN THE PARLOUR BEHIND THE SHOP SHE TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HER MOTHER
STARED WITH A HAUGHTY DROOP ON EACH SIDE OF A HOOKED AGGRESSIVE NOSE NOBLY SALIENT IN THE VAST PALE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE FACE A SHINY SILK HAT AND A PAIR OF WORN GLOVES LYING READY ON THE END OF A LONG TABLE LOOKED EXPANDED TOO
OR ELSE THE HEROES WOULD HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR OWN CLOTHES LIKEWISE NO DEPARTMENT APPEARS PERFECTLY WISE TO THE INTIMACY OF ITS WORKERS A DEPARTMENT DOES NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS SOME OF ITS SERVANTS BEING A DISPASSIONATE ORGANISM
IT HAD THAT QUALITY OF SERIOUSNESS BELONGING TO EVERY FORM OF OPEN SPORT
MORE OR LESS DEPLORABLE DOES HAPPEN BUT THE HIGH OFFICIAL CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS
BY A DIVERSITY OF DREADFUL SILENCES BUT SHE DID NOT ALLOW HER INWARD APPREHENSIONS TO ROB HER OF THE ADVANTAGE OF VENERABLE PLACIDITY CONFERRED UPON HER OUTWARD PERSON BY HER TRIPLE CHIN
THE NAMES WERE PRINCIPALLY THE NAMES OF LICENSED VICTUALLERS POOR DADDY'S FRIENDS MY DEAR SHE ENLARGED WITH SPECIAL APPRECIATION ON THE KINDNESS AND CONDESCENSION OF A LARGE BREWER A BARONET AND AN M P
ON THE POINT OF TAKING OUT THE JAM SHE REFLECTED PRACTICALLY HE WILL BE FEELING HUNGRY HAVING BEEN AWAY ALL DAY AND SHE RETURNED TO THE CUPBOARD ONCE MORE TO GET THE COLD BEEF SHE SET IT UNDER THE PURRING GAS JET AND WITH A PASSING GLANCE
FROM HIS EMPANELLED COUNTRYMEN AND THAT SORT OF COMPUNCTION APPEARED SHOCKINGLY IMPERFECT TO THE CRAMMED COURT THE JUDGE ON PASSING SENTENCE COMMENTED FEELINGLY UPON THE DEPRAVITY AND CALLOUSNESS OF THE YOUNG PRISONER
IT'S A NOXIOUS RASCALLY LOOKING ALTOGETHER DETESTABLE BEAST WITH A SORT OF SMOOTH FACE AND MOUSTACHES DESCRIBED TO A T COMMENDED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ONLY MINE IS CLEAN SHAVEN ALTOGETHER YOU'VE SEEN HIM
HE'S ALL THERE EVERY BIT OF HIM IT WAS A JOB HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST MAN ON THE SPOT AFTER THE EXPLOSION HE MENTIONED THE FACT AGAIN HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE FOG
WALKED IN BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE DID NOT LOOK OVERTLY AT THE CUSTOMER TILL SHE HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF COMFORTABLY ON THE CHAIR BUT BY THAT TIME SHE HAD NOTED THAT HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND WORE HIS MOUSTACHES TWISTED UP
BUT HE REFRAINED FROM POINTING OUT TO HIS WIFE THAT THE IDEA OF MAKING STEVIE THE COMPANION OF HIS WALKS WAS HER OWN AND NOBODY ELSE'S AT THAT MOMENT TO AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER MISTER VERLOC WOULD HAVE APPEARED MORE THAN HUMAN IN HIS MAGNANIMITY
IT WAS NOT OF GOING OUT IN THE EVENING THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS THINKING HIS THOUGHTS EMBRACED A VASTER SCHEME FROM MOODY AND INCOMPLETE PHRASES IT BECAME APPARENT THAT MISTER VERLOC HAD BEEN CONSIDERING THE EXPEDIENCY OF EMIGRATING
SO THIS INSTRUCTIVE CRIME WAS PLANNED ABROAD MISTER VLADIMIR SAID QUICKLY YOU ADMIT IT WAS PLANNED ABROAD THEORETICALLY THEORETICALLY ONLY ON FOREIGN TERRITORY ABROAD ONLY BY A FICTION SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIS IGNORANCE OF ALL OTHER INDUSTRIAL MATTERS IMMENSE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU EVER MET BEFORE SAID THE GREAT LADY MISTER VLADIMIR AND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTRODUCED ACKNOWLEDGED EACH OTHER'S EXISTENCE WITH PUNCTILIOUS AND GUARDED COURTESY
DURING HIS WALKS MISTER VERLOC OF COURSE MET AND CONVERSED WITH VARIOUS PERSONS IT COULD HARDLY BE OTHERWISE HIS WALKS WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF HIS OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES WHICH HIS WIFE HAD NEVER LOOKED DEEPLY INTO
AND THE CONVERSATION DROPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MISTER VLADIMIR TOOK LEAVE DIRECTLY HIS BACK WAS TURNED ON THE COUCH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROSE TOO
IT WAS NOT A LONG DRIVE IT ENDED BY SIGNAL ABRUPTLY NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN TWO LAMP POSTS BEFORE A LARGE DRAPERY ESTABLISHMENT A LONG RANGE OF SHOPS ALREADY LAPPED UP IN SHEETS OF CORRUGATED IRON FOR THE NIGHT
IN ORDER TO REACH SOONER THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TAKE HIS OMNIBUS HE TURNED BRUSQUELY OUT OF THE POPULOUS STREET INTO A NARROW AND DUSKY ALLEY PAVED WITH FLAGSTONES
HER SOUL WAS TRIUMPHANT AND HER HEART TREMULOUS INWARDLY SHE QUAKED BECAUSE SHE DREADED AND ADMIRED THE CALM SELF CONTAINED CHARACTER OF HER DAUGHTER WINNIE WHOSE DISPLEASURE WAS MADE REDOUBTABLE
THE HINT OF AN INVINCIBLE MULTITUDE BEHIND THAT MAN'S BACK ROUSED A SOMBRE INDIGNATION IN THE BREAST OF THE PROFESSOR HE SMILED NO LONGER HIS ENIGMATIC AND MOCKING SMILE
SHADES OF GREEN SILK FITTED LOW OVER ALL THE LIGHTS IMPARTED TO THE ROOM SOMETHING OF A FOREST'S DEEP GLOOM THE HAUGHTY EYES WERE PHYSICALLY THE GREAT MAN'S WEAK POINT THIS POINT WAS WRAPPED UP IN SECRECY
GREW UPON HER HEARING BIZARRE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE IT ARRESTED MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION THEN AS ITS CHARACTER BECAME PLAIN TO THE EAR SHE STOPPED SHORT AMAZED AND CONCERNED
WHEN CRIED ANOTHER WHAT DOTH AIL THEE BOCCA
IF THOU SHOULDST QUESTIONED BE WHO ELSE WAS THERE
INTO THE LIGHT OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING KINDLED IN HER HOLY EYES MARVEL THOU NOT SHE SAID TO ME BECAUSE I SMILE AT THIS THY PUERILE CONCEIT
AND NEATH WHOSE COPE WAS PUT TO DEATH THE MAN WHO WITHOUT SIN WAS BORN AND LIVED
WHATEVER OF THE HOLY REALM I HAD THE POWER TO TREASURE IN MY MIND SHALL NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG O GOOD APOLLO FOR THIS LAST EMPRISE MAKE OF ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY POWER
WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
THE STUMPS UPLIFTING THROUGH THE MURKY AIR SO THAT THE BLOOD MADE HORRIBLE HIS FACE CRIED OUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER MOSCA ALSO WHO SAID ALAS A THING DONE HAS AN END WHICH WAS AN ILL SEED FOR THE TUSCAN PEOPLE
HAVE I GREAT GRATITUDE FROM THEE
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
WHEN FROM A MALE A FEMALE HE BECAME HIS MEMBERS BEING ALL OF THEM TRANSFORMED AND AFTERWARDS WAS FORCED TO STRIKE ONCE MORE THE TWO ENTANGLED SERPENTS WITH HIS ROD ERE HE COULD HAVE AGAIN HIS MANLY PLUMES
E'ER MADE A LAKE SO WIDELY SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND AND THE GREAT LIGHT KINDLED IN ME A LONGING FOR THEIR CAUSE NEVER BEFORE WITH SUCH ACUTENESS FELT WHENCE SHE
I SAW TURNED ROUND AND GAZING AT THE SUN NEVER DID EAGLE FASTEN SO UPON IT AND EVEN AS A SECOND RAY IS WONT TO ISSUE FROM THE FIRST AND REASCEND LIKE TO A PILGRIM WHO WOULD FAIN RETURN
DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
DRAW NIGH THAT I MAY TAKE THEE THEN OF HIMSELF AND ME ONE BUNDLE MADE AS SEEMS THE CARISENDA TO BEHOLD BENEATH THE LEANING SIDE WHEN GOES A CLOUD ABOVE IT SO THAT OPPOSITE IT HANGS
IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
IF I HAD NOT BEHELD THE MANACLES THEN WE PROCEEDED FARTHER IN ADVANCE
THEN SIGHING WITH A VOICE OF LAMENTATION SAID TO ME THEN WHAT WANTEST THOU OF ME IF WHO I AM THOU CAREST SO MUCH TO KNOW THAT THOU ON THAT ACCOUNT HAST CROSSED THE BANK KNOW THAT I VESTED WAS WITH THE GREAT MANTLE
AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
FOR AFTER HIM SHALL COME OF FOULER DEED FROM TOW'RDS THE WEST A PASTOR WITHOUT LAW SUCH AS BEFITS TO COVER HIM AND ME NEW JASON WILL HE BE OF WHOM WE READ IN MACCABEES AND AS HIS KING WAS PLIANT SO HE WHO GOVERNS FRANCE SHALL BE TO THIS ONE
WITH THE OTHER BURTHEN DROWNED HERSELF AND AT THE TIME WHEN FORTUNE DOWNWARD HURLED THE TROJAN'S ARROGANCE THAT ALL THINGS DARED SO THAT THE KING WAS WITH HIS KINGDOM CRUSHED HECUBA SAD DISCONSOLATE AND CAPTIVE
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
AND UNITES THE EARTH NOR ONLY THE CREATED THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE THIS BOW SHOOTS FORTH BUT THOSE THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECT AND LOVE THE PROVIDENCE THAT REGULATES ALL THIS
OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
SO MAY THY NAILS SUFFICE THEE TO ALL ETERNITY UNTO THIS WORK LATIANS ARE WE WHOM THOU SO WASTED SEEST BOTH OF US HERE ONE WEEPING MADE REPLY BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTIONEST ABOUT US AND SAID THE GUIDE
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
HERE IT IS MORN WHEN IT IS EVENING THERE
FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
THE GUIDE AND I INTO THAT HIDDEN ROAD NOW ENTERED TO RETURN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD AND WITHOUT CARE OF HAVING ANY REST WE MOUNTED UP HE FIRST AND I THE SECOND
LET THE RENOWN OF US THY MIND INCLINE TO TELL US WHO THOU ART WHO THUS SECURELY THY LIVING FEET DOST MOVE ALONG THROUGH HELL HE IN WHOSE FOOTPRINTS THOU DOST SEE ME TREADING NAKED AND SKINLESS THOUGH HE NOW MAY GO WAS OF A GREATER RANK THAN THOU DOST THINK
INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
THEN TOW'RDS ME HE OUTSTRETCHED HIS WARY STEP I LIFTED UP MINE EYES AND THOUGHT TO SEE LUCIFER IN THE SAME WAY I HAD LEFT HIM AND I BEHELD HIM UPWARD HOLD HIS LEGS
HE PUT US DOWN NOR THUS BOWED DOWNWARD MADE HE THERE DELAY BUT AS A MAST DOES IN A SHIP UPROSE INFERNO
LIFT FROM MINE EYES THE RIGID VEILS THAT I MAY VENT THE SORROW WHICH IMPREGNS MY HEART A LITTLE E'ER THE WEEPING RECONGEAL WHENCE I TO HIM IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME HELP THEE
THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
TAKE HEED THAT THOU EMBRACE ME BUT HE WHO OTHER TIMES HAD RESCUED ME IN OTHER PERIL SOON AS I HAD MOUNTED WITHIN HIS ARMS ENCIRCLED AND SUSTAINED ME
AND AS ABOUT SUCH STRONGHOLDS FROM THEIR GATES UNTO THE OUTER BANK ARE LITTLE BRIDGES SO FROM THE PRECIPICE'S BASE DID CRAGS PROJECT WHICH INTERSECTED DIKES AND MOATS UNTO THE WELL THAT TRUNCATES AND COLLECTS THEM
NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
AND THEREFORE ARE CLEFT THUS A DEVIL IS BEHIND HERE WHO DOTH CLEAVE US THUS CRUELLY
HE WHO SHALL BRING THE SATCHEL WITH THREE GOATS THEN TWISTED HE HIS MOUTH AND FORTH HE THRUST HIS TONGUE LIKE TO AN OX THAT LICKS ITS NOSE AND FEARING LEST MY LONGER STAY MIGHT VEX HIM WHO HAD WARNED ME NOT TO TARRY LONG BACKWARD I TURNED ME FROM THOSE WEARY SOULS
NOW GO THY WAY NO MORE I URGE THEE BECAUSE I COME PERCHANCE A LITTLE LATE TO STAY AND SPEAK WITH ME LET IT NOT IRK THEE THOU SEEST IT IRKS NOT ME AND I AM BURNING
I LEAVE THE GALL AND GO FOR THE SWEET FRUITS PROMISED TO ME BY THE VERACIOUS LEADER BUT TO THE CENTRE FIRST I NEEDS MUST PLUNGE SO MAY THE SOUL FOR A LONG WHILE CONDUCT THOSE LIMBS OF THINE DID HE MAKE ANSWER THEN
AS IF BEMOCKED AND KNOW NOT HOW TO ANSWER THEN SAID VIRGILIUS SAY TO HIM STRAIGHTWAY I AM NOT HE I AM NOT HE THOU THINKEST AND I REPLIED AS WAS IMPOSED ON ME
THE PROMISE LONG WITH THE FULFILMENT SHORT WILL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT FRANCIS CAME AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS DEAD FOR ME BUT ONE OF THE BLACK CHERUBIM SAID TO HIM TAKE HIM NOT DO ME NO WRONG
I TURNED ME ROUND TOWARDS HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT STILL IT EDDIES THROUGH MY MEMORY AND AS HE IS WHO DREAMS OF HIS OWN HARM WHO DREAMING WISHES IT MAY BE A DREAM SO THAT HE CRAVES WHAT IS AS IF IT WERE NOT SUCH I BECAME
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
BE THIS A SEAL ALL MEN TO UNDECEIVE OUT OF THE MOUTH OF EACH ONE THERE PROTRUDED THE FEET OF A TRANSGRESSOR AND THE LEGS UP TO THE CALF THE REST WITHIN REMAINED IN ALL OF THEM THE SOLES WERE BOTH ON FIRE WHEREFORE THE JOINTS SO VIOLENTLY QUIVERED
THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
WHAT BECAME I WHO BY MY NATURE AM EXCEEDING MUTABLE IN EVERY GUISE AS IN A FISH POND WHICH IS PURE AND TRANQUIL THE FISHES DRAW TO THAT WHICH FROM WITHOUT COMES IN SUCH FASHION THAT THEIR FOOD THEY DEEM IT
BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
I JOINED MYSELF AGAIN UNTO MINE ESCORT THEREAFTERWARD WITH FOOTSTEPS FEW WE CAME TO WHERE A CRAG PROJECTED FROM THE BANK THIS VERY EASILY DID WE ASCEND AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT ALONG ITS RIDGE FROM THOSE ETERNAL CIRCLES WE DEPARTED
THE VALLEY WHENCE BISENZIO DESCENDS BELONGED TO THEM AND TO THEIR FATHER ALBERT THEY FROM ONE BODY CAME AND ALL CAINA THOU SHALT SEARCH THROUGH AND SHALT NOT FIND A SHADE MORE WORTHY TO BE FIXED IN GELATINE
ALL OF ONE SIZE AND EVERY ONE WAS ROUND TO ME LESS AMPLE SEEMED THEY NOT NOR GREATER THAN THOSE THAT IN MY BEAUTIFUL SAINT JOHN ARE FASHIONED FOR THE PLACE OF THE BAPTISERS AND ONE OF WHICH NOT MANY YEARS AGO I BROKE FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS DROWNING IN IT
I WOULD PRESS OUT THE JUICE OF MY CONCEPTION MORE FULLY BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THEM NOT NOT WITHOUT FEAR I BRING MYSELF TO SPEAK
THE BOTTOM IS SO DEEP NO PLACE SUFFICES TO GIVE US SIGHT OF IT
WHAT ART THOU WONT TO WEEP AT THEY WERE AWAKE NOW AND THE HOUR DREW NIGH AT WHICH OUR FOOD USED TO BE BROUGHT TO US AND THROUGH HIS DREAM WAS EACH ONE APPREHENSIVE
THAT ARUNS IS WHO BACKS THE OTHER'S BELLY WHO IN THE HILLS OF LUNI
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
AMONG THE MARBLES WHITE A CAVERN HAD FOR HIS ABODE WHENCE TO BEHOLD THE STARS AND SEA THE VIEW WAS NOT CUT OFF FROM HIM AND SHE THERE WHO IS COVERING UP HER BREASTS WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST NOT WITH LOOSENED TRESSES
BUT COME NOW FOR ALREADY HOLDS THE CONFINES OF BOTH THE HEMISPHERES AND UNDER SEVILLE TOUCHES THE OCEAN WAVE CAIN AND THE THORNS AND YESTERNIGHT THE MOON WAS ROUND ALREADY THOU SHOULDST REMEMBER WELL IT DID NOT HARM THEE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHIN THE FOREST DEEP
TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
AND THOU'RT ALESSIO INTERMINEI OF LUCCA THEREFORE I EYE THEE MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS AND HE THEREON BELABOURING HIS PUMPKIN THE FLATTERIES HAVE SUBMERGED ME HERE BELOW WHEREWITH MY TONGUE WAS NEVER SURFEITED
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
SPREAD OUT THE NETS THAT I MAY TAKE THE LIONESS AND HER WHELPS UPON THE PASSAGE AND THEN EXTENDED HIS UNPITYING CLAWS SEIZING THE FIRST WHO HAD THE NAME LEARCHUS AND WHIRLED HIM ROUND AND DASHED HIM ON A ROCK AND SHE
NOT THE SOLE BOLOGNESE AM I WHO WEEPS HERE NAY RATHER IS THIS PLACE SO FULL OF THEM THAT NOT SO MANY TONGUES TO DAY ARE TAUGHT TWIXT RENO AND SAVENA TO SAY SIPA AND IF THEREOF THOU WISHEST PLEDGE OR PROOF BRING TO THY MIND OUR AVARICIOUS HEART

NOT OTHERWISE IN SUMMER DO THE DOGS NOW WITH THE FOOT NOW WITH THE MUZZLE WHEN BY FLEAS OR FLIES OR GADFLIES THEY ARE BITTEN WHEN I HAD TURNED MINE EYES UPON THE FACES OF SOME ON WHOM THE DOLOROUS FIRE IS FALLING NOT ONE OF THEM I KNEW
WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
BOTH OF MY HANDS IN AGONY I BIT AND THINKING THAT I DID IT FROM DESIRE OF EATING ON A SUDDEN THEY UPROSE AND SAID THEY FATHER
HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
MASTER SAY WHAT TOWN IS THIS AND HE TO ME BECAUSE THOU PEEREST FORTH ATHWART THE DARKNESS AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE
THESE FANS OF LEAVES FROM INDIAN TREES THESE CRIMSON SHELLS FROM INDIAN SEAS THESE TINY PORTRAITS SET IN RINGS ONCE DOUBTLESS DEEMED SUCH PRECIOUS THINGS KEEPSAKES BESTOWED BY LOVE ON FAITH
MEMENTOS OF PAST PAINS AND PLEASURES THESE VOLUMES CLASPED WITH COSTLY STONE WITH PRINT ALL FADED GILDING GONE THESE FANS OF LEAVES FROM INDIAN TREES
SOME FIRS COEVAL WITH THE TOWER THEIR STRAIGHT BLACK BOUGHS STRETCHED O'ER HER HEAD UNSEEN BENEATH THIS SABLE BOWER RUSTLED HER DRESS AND RAPID TREAD
AND SHE TOO LOVED THE TWILIGHT WOOD AND OFTEN IN HER MOTHER'S MOOD AWAY TO YONDER HILL WOULD HIE LIKE HER TO WATCH THE SETTING SUN OR SEE THE STARS BORN ONE BY ONE OUT OF THE DARKENING SKY
BUT OF ALL LOVELY THINGS SHE LOVED A CLOUDLESS MOON ON SUMMER NIGHT FULL OFT HAVE I IMPATIENCE PROVED TO SEE HOW LONG HER STILL DELIGHT WOULD FIND A THEME IN REVERIE OUT ON THE LAWN
LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THEN AGAIN HER VOICE THE STAGNANT MIDNIGHT STIRRED MUST IT BE SO IS THIS MY FATE CAN I NOR STRUGGLE NOR CONTEND
LOVE MAY RESTORE HIM YET TO ME FALSE THOUGHT FALSE HOPE IN SCORN BE BANISHED I AM NOT LOVED NOR LOVED HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE SUN SHE SEEMED TO BLESS WITH HAPPY GLANCE THE GLORIOUS SKY SHE LOVED SUCH SCENES AND AS SHE GAZED HER FACE EVINCED HER SPIRIT'S MOOD BEAUTY OR GRANDEUR EVER RAISED IN HER A DEEP FELT GRATITUDE
IT POURED NOT OUT LIKE OPEN SLUICE NO SPARKLING STILL AND REDLY FLASHING DRAINED DROP BY DROP THE GENEROUS JUICE I SAW IT SINK AND STROVE TO TASTE IT
WHERE DOUBTS EXPIRE AND DRINK IN WAVES OF LIVING GOLD CONTENTMENT FULL FOR LONG DESIRE WILL HE FIND BLISS WHICH HERE HE DREAMED REST WHICH WAS WEARINESS ON EARTH KNOWLEDGE
HER FERVID SOUL TRANSFUSED INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HEARD AND TRANSIENT STRENGTH AND ARDOUR STIRRED IN MINDS TO STRENGTH UNUSED YET IN GAY CROWD OR FESTAL GLARE GRAVE AND RETIRING WAS HER AIR
AND ON THE PAVEMENT SPREAD BEFORE THE LONG FRONT OF THE MANSION GREY HER STEPS IMPRINT THE NIGHT FROST HOAR WHICH PALE ON GRASS AND GRANITE LAY
LEST DOUBTFUL SHADE OR MOONBEAM TREMBLING MIGHT TAKE HER ASPECT ONCE SO DEAR HERS WAS THIS CHAMBER IN HER TIME IT SEEMED TO ME A PLEASANT ROOM
TO SOLITUDE AND TO THE NIGHT SOME WORDS SHE NOW IN MURMURS SAID AND TRICKLING THROUGH HER FINGERS WHITE SOME TEARS OF MISERY SHE SHED GOD HELP ME IN MY GRIEVOUS NEED
SOME FIRS COEVAL WITH THE TOWER THEIR STRAIGHT BLACK BOUGHS STRETCHED O'ER HER HEAD
ENDURE MY WEARY FRAME AND WHEN THY ANGUISH STRIKES TOO DEEP AND WHEN ALL TROUBLED BURNS LIFE'S FLAME THINK OF THE QUIET FINAL SLEEP THINK OF THE GLORIOUS WAKING HOUR
WHEN EVERY SENSE AND FEELING PROVED EXPECTANCY OF BRIGHTEST DAY WHEN THE HAND TREMBLED TO RECEIVE A THRILLING CLASP WHICH SEEMED SO NEAR
BUT OF ALL LOVELY THINGS SHE LOVED A CLOUDLESS MOON ON SUMMER NIGHT FULL OFT HAVE I IMPATIENCE PROVED TO SEE HOW LONG HER STILL DELIGHT WOULD FIND A THEME IN REVERIE OUT ON THE LAWN
WILL HE FIND LOVE WITHOUT LUST'S LEAVEN LOVE FEARLESS TEARLESS PERFECT PURE TO ALL WITH EQUAL BOUNTY GIVEN IN ALL UNFEIGNED UNFAILING SURE
BE CALM IN FRENZY SMILE AT PAIN PALE WITH THE SECRET WAR OF FEELING SUSTAINED WITH COURAGE MUTE YET HIGH THE WOUNDS AT WHICH SHE BLED REVEALING ONLY BY ALTERED CHEEK AND EYE
I CLIMB THE STAIR RELUCTANTLY SOME SHAPE THAT SHOULD BE WELL IN HEAVEN OR ILL ELSEWHERE WILL PASS BY ME I FEAR TO SEE THE VERY FACES FAMILIAR THIRTY YEARS AGO EVEN IN THE OLD ACCUSTOMED PLACES
AND CLOUDED PROUD AND STERN NOR WHEREFORE FRIENDSHIP'S FORMS FORGETTING HE CARELESS LEFT AND COOL WITHDREW NOR SPOKE OF GRIEF NOR FOND REGRETTING
COULD ALMOST CURSE THE GUILTY DEAD FOR WOES THE GUILTLESS PROVED AND HEAVEN DID CURSE THEY FOUND HIM LAID WHEN CRIME FOR WRATH WAS RIFE COLD WITH THE SUICIDAL BLADE
DISSEMBLE TRUTH WITH CEASELESS ART WITH OUTWARD CALM MASK INWARD STRIFE SHE WAITED AS FOR SOME REPLY THE STILL AND CLOUDY NIGHT GAVE NONE
MY EAGER LIPS APPROACHED THE BRIM THE MOVEMENT ONLY SEEMED TO WASTE IT IT SANK TO DREGS ALL HARSH AND DIM THESE I HAVE DRUNK AND THEY FOR EVER HAVE POISONED LIFE AND LOVE FOR ME
AND I THE WEIGHT OF WOE REMOVING AM FREE AND FETTERLESS AS HE NEW SCENES NEW LANGUAGE SKIES LESS CLOUDED MAY ONCE MORE WAKE THE WISH TO LIVE
FALSE THOUGHT FALSE HOPE IN SCORN BE BANISHED I AM NOT LOVED NOR LOVED HAVE BEEN RECALL NOT THEN THE DREAMS SCARCE VANISHED TRAITORS MISLEAD ME NOT AGAIN
STIFLES A HEART THAT SCARCE CAN BEAT AND THOUGH SO LATE AND LONE THE HOUR
AND OUTSIDE ALL IS IVY CLINGING TO CHIMNEY LATTICE GABLE GREY SCARCELY ONE LITTLE RED ROSE SPRINGING THROUGH THE GREEN MOSS CAN FORCE ITS WAY
NOT LONG SHE STAYED WHERE MISTY MOON AND SHIMMERING STARS COULD ON HER LOOK BUT THROUGH THE GARDEN ARCHWAY SOON HER STRANGE AND GLOOMY PATH SHE TOOK
ON FREE HILL SIDE IN SUNNY FIELD IN QUIET SPOTS BY WOODS CONCEALED
THOUGH DIMMED SO LONG WITH SECRET PAIN SHE WILL RETURN BUT COLD AND ALTERED LIKE ALL WHOSE HOPES TOO SOON DEPART LIKE ALL ON WHOM HAVE BEAT UNSHELTERED
MY CRYING THOUGH LIGHTNING STRUCK I MUST LIVE ON I KNOW AT HEART THERE IS NO DYING OF LOVE AND RUINED HOPE ALONE STILL STRONG AND YOUNG
MY TEARS COLLECT AND FALL UNFELT MY SORROW TOUCHES NONE WITH PAIN MY HUMBLE HOPES TO NOTHING MELT FOR ME THE UNIVERSE IS DUMB STONE DEAF AND BLANK AND WHOLLY BLIND
IF STILL THE PATHS OF LORE SHE FOLLOW TWILL BE WITH TIRED AND GOADED WILL SHE'LL ONLY TOIL THE ACHING HOLLOW THE JOYLESS BLANK OF LIFE TO FILL
FOR THEN NO CLOUD OF GRIEF OR CRIME HAD CURSED IT WITH A SETTLED GLOOM I HAD NOT SEEN DEATH'S IMAGE LAID IN SHROUD AND SHEET ON YONDER BED BEFORE SHE MARRIED SHE WAS BLEST BLEST IN HER YOUTH
NIGHT CLOSING O'ER THE EARTH INFECTS OUR THOUGHTS WITH GLOOM
SO SPEAKS EXPERIENCE SAGE AND HOARY I SEE IT PLAINLY KNOW IT WELL LIKE ONE WHO HAVING READ A STORY EACH INCIDENT THEREIN CAN TELL TOUCH NOT THAT RING
I'VE HEARD OF HEAVEN I WOULD BELIEVE FOR IF THIS EARTH INDEED BE ALL WHO LONGEST LIVES MAY DEEPEST GRIEVE MOST BLEST WHOM SORROWS SOONEST CALL OH
THEY NAMED HIM MAD AND LAID HIS BONES WHERE HOLIER ASHES LIE YET DOUBT NOT THAT HIS SPIRIT GROANS IN HELL'S ETERNITY BUT LO
I'VE HEARD OF HEAVEN I WOULD BELIEVE FOR IF THIS EARTH INDEED BE ALL WHO LONGEST LIVES MAY DEEPEST GRIEVE
OR WHERE THE TREES LET IN THE LUSTRE FITFULLY AS THEIR BOUGHS PARTED MOMENTLY TO THE SOFT LANGUID SUMMER BREEZE ALAS THAT SHE SHOULD E'ER HAVE
THE DAW AND STARLING NESTLE WHERE THE TALL TURRET RISES HIGH AND WINDS ALONE COME NEAR TO RUSTLE THE THICK LEAVES WHERE THEIR CRADLES LIE I SOMETIMES THINK WHEN LATE AT EVEN
HER STEPS NOW FAST NOW LINGERING SLOW IN VARYING MOTION SEEK RELIEF
MORN COMES AND ERE MERIDIAN GLORY O'ER THESE MY NATAL WOODS SHALL SMILE BOTH LONELY WOOD AND MANSION HOARY I'LL LEAVE BEHIND
SUSTAINED WITH COURAGE MUTE YET HIGH THE WOUNDS AT WHICH SHE BLED REVEALING ONLY BY ALTERED CHEEK AND EYE SHE BORE IN SILENCE
FOR THOUGH THE WASTED BODY TREMBLED THE UNCONQUERED MIND TO QUAIL DISDAINED SHE CROSSED THE SEA NOW LONE SHE WANDERS BY SEINE'S OR RHINE'S OR ARNO'S FLOW
TO SOLITUDE AND TO THE NIGHT SOME WORDS SHE NOW IN MURMURS SAID AND TRICKLING THROUGH HER FINGERS WHITE SOME TEARS OF MISERY SHE SHED GOD HELP ME IN MY GRIEVOUS NEED
THEN GLANCING BACK ON TIME'S BRIEF WOES WILL HE BEHOLD THEM FADING FLY SWEPT FROM ETERNITY'S REPOSE LIKE SULLYING CLOUD FROM PURE BLUE SKY IF SO
LONG LONG HER WANDERING STEPS DELAYED TO QUIT THE SOMBRE FOREST SHADE THROUGH WHICH HER EERIE PATHWAY LAY YOU ASK IF SHE HAD BEAUTY'S GRACE I KNOW NOT
AND AM I DOOMED FOR YEARS TO WAIT WATCHING DEATH'S LINGERING AXE DESCEND AND WHEN IT FALLS AND WHEN I DIE WHAT FOLLOWS VACANT NOTHINGNESS THE BLANK OF LOST IDENTITY
OH BITTER BLIGHTING KEEN SENSATION WHICH WILL NOT WEAKEN CANNOT DIE HASTEN THY WORK OF DESOLATION AND LET MY TORTURED SPIRIT FLY VAIN AS THE PASSING GALE
AND WARM WITH VIGOUR THOUGH SCATHED I LONG SHALL GREENLY GROW AND MANY A STORM OF WILDEST RIGOUR
THE BOOK SHELVES WERE HER DARLING TREASURE SHE RARELY SEEMED THE TIME TO MEASURE WHILE SHE COULD READ ALONE AND SHE TOO LOVED THE TWILIGHT WOOD AND OFTEN IN HER MOTHER'S MOOD AWAY TO YONDER HILL WOULD HIE
WHEN THE HAND TREMBLED TO RECEIVE A THRILLING CLASP WHICH SEEMED SO NEAR AND THE HEART VENTURED TO BELIEVE ANOTHER HEART ESTEEMED IT DEAR WHEN WORDS HALF LOVE ALL TENDERNESS
A DRAUGHT FROM SODOM'S LAKE COULD NEVER MORE FIERY SALT AND BITTER BE OH LOVE WAS ALL A THIN ILLUSION JOY BUT THE DESERT'S FLYING STREAM
UNSCARED THE DAW AND STARLING NESTLE WHERE THE TALL TURRET RISES HIGH AND WINDS ALONE COME NEAR TO RUSTLE THE THICK LEAVES WHERE THEIR CRADLES LIE
I KNOW NOT IF HER FRIENDLESSNESS DID SOMETIMES ON HER SPIRIT PRESS BUT PLAINT SHE NEVER MADE THE BOOK SHELVES WERE HER DARLING TREASURE SHE RARELY SEEMED THE TIME TO MEASURE WHILE SHE COULD READ ALONE
STAMPED DEEP ON VISION HEART AND BRAIN AND WE MIGHT MEET TIME MAY HAVE CHANGED HIM CHANCE MAY REVEAL THE MYSTERY THE SECRET INFLUENCE WHICH ESTRANGED HIM
TRAITORS MISLEAD ME NOT AGAIN TO WORDS LIKE YOURS I BID DEFIANCE TIS SUCH MY MENTAL WRECK HAVE MADE OF GOD ALONE AND SELF RELIANCE I ASK FOR SOLACE HOPE FOR AID
MY SORROW TOUCHES NONE WITH PAIN MY HUMBLE HOPES TO NOTHING MELT FOR ME THE UNIVERSE IS DUMB STONE DEAF AND BLANK AND WHOLLY BLIND LIFE I MUST BOUND
SHE WAITED AS FOR SOME REPLY THE STILL AND CLOUDY NIGHT GAVE NONE ERE LONG WITH DEEP DRAWN TREMBLING SIGH HER HEAVY PLAINT AGAIN BEGUN UNLOVED I LOVE UNWEPT I WEEP
NOR WONDER'S GAZE NOR EVEN EXAGGERATED PRAISE NOR EVEN NOTICE IF TOO KEEN THE CURIOUS GAZER SEARCHED HER MIEN NATURE'S OWN GREEN EXPANSE REVEALED THE WORLD THE PLEASURES SHE COULD PRIZE
THE ROOMS DISCOVER BEREFT FOR YEARS OF FIRE AND LAMP THE SUN SOMETIMES IN SUMMER ENTERS THE CASEMENTS WITH REVIVING RAY BUT THE LONG RAINS OF MANY WINTERS
SO SPEAKS EXPERIENCE SAGE AND HOARY I SEE IT PLAINLY KNOW IT WELL LIKE ONE WHO HAVING READ A STORY EACH INCIDENT THEREIN CAN TELL
I SEE A NEARER BEACON GLEAMING OVER DEJECTION'S SEA OF GLOOM THE VERY WILDNESS OF MY SORROW TELLS ME I YET HAVE INNATE FORCE MY TRACK OF LIFE HAS BEEN TOO NARROW
ARRANGING LONG LOCKED DRAWERS AND SHELVES OF CABINETS SHUT UP FOR YEARS WHAT A STRANGE TASK WE'VE SET OURSELVES HOW STILL THE LONELY ROOM APPEARS HOW STRANGE THIS MASS OF ANCIENT TREASURES
WHENCE THEN THIS VAIN AND BARREN DREAMING OF DEATH AND DUBIOUS LIFE TO COME I SEE A NEARER BEACON GLEAMING OVER DEJECTION'S SEA OF GLOOM
ALL CALM AND GLORIOUS RISE AND SEE CREATION'S SIRE EXISTENCE GOD THEN GLANCING BACK ON TIME'S BRIEF WOES WILL HE BEHOLD THEM FADING FLY
DECEIVED BY FALSE AND GUILEFUL TONGUE SHE GAVE HER HAND THEN SUFFERED WRONG OPPRESSED ILL USED SHE FADED YOUNG AND DIED OF GRIEF BY SLOW DECAY OPEN THAT CASKET
AND NEITHER WORD NOR TOKEN SENDING OF KINDNESS SINCE THE PARTING DAY HIS COURSE FOR DISTANT REGIONS BENDING WENT SELF CONTAINED AND CALM AWAY
THERE WAKE AND DWELL CONTENT WITH PALSY PAIN AND GLOOM AGAIN SHE PAUSED A MOAN OF PAIN A STIFLED SOB ALONE WAS HEARD
YET NATURE'S FEELINGS DEEPLY LAY IN THAT ENDOWED AND YOUTHFUL FRAME SHRINED IN HER HEART AND HID FROM DAY THEY BURNED UNSEEN WITH SILENT FLAME IN YOUTH'S FIRST SEARCH FOR MENTAL LIGHT
DAYS LONG A CONSTANT WEIGHT THE YOKE OF ABSOLUTE DESPAIR A SUFFERING WHOLLY DESOLATE WHO CAN FOR EVER CRUSH THE HEART RESTRAIN ITS THROBBING CURB ITS LIFE
EYES OF UNCLOUDED SMILING LIGHT HER SOFT AND CURLED AND FLOATING HAIR GEMS AND ATTIRE AS RAINBOW BRIGHT RECLINED IN YONDER DEEP RECESS
INFECTS OUR THOUGHTS WITH GLOOM
AND WORN TILL THE RECEIVER'S DEATH NOW STORED WITH CAMEOS CHINA SHELLS IN THIS OLD CLOSET'S DUSTY CELLS I SCARCELY THINK FOR TEN LONG YEARS A HAND HAS TOUCHED THESE RELICS OLD
THE SIRE OF THAT FORSAKEN CHILD AND NOUGHT HIS RELICS CAN INSPIRE SAVE MEMORIES SIN DEFILED I WHO SAT BY HIS WIFE'S DEATH BED I WHO HIS DAUGHTER LOVED
IN QUIET SPOTS BY WOODS CONCEALED GREW WILD AND FRESH HER CHOSEN JOYS YET NATURE'S FEELINGS DEEPLY LAY IN THAT ENDOWED AND YOUTHFUL FRAME SHRINED IN HER HEART AND HID FROM DAY
TOUCH NOT THAT RING TWAS HIS THE SIRE OF THAT FORSAKEN CHILD AND NOUGHT HIS RELICS CAN INSPIRE SAVE MEMORIES SIN DEFILED I WHO SAT BY HIS WIFE'S DEATH BED I
AND OH FULL OFT QUITE SPENT AND WEARY HER HAND WILL PAUSE HER HEAD DECLINE THAT LABOUR SEEMS SO HARD AND DREARY ON WHICH NO RAY OF HOPE MAY SHINE
WHEN LORN AND LOVELESS LIFE WILL LANGUISH BUT COURAGE CAN REVIVE THE FLAME HE WHEN HE LEFT ME WENT A ROVING TO SUNNY CLIMES BEYOND THE SEA AND I
THEY NAMED HIM MAD AND LAID HIS BONES WHERE HOLIER ASHES LIE YET DOUBT NOT THAT HIS SPIRIT GROANS IN HELL'S ETERNITY BUT LO
GOD HELP ME IN MY INWARD PAIN WHICH CANNOT ASK FOR PITY'S MEED WHICH HAS NO LICENCE TO COMPLAIN WHICH MUST BE BORNE YET WHO CAN BEAR HOURS LONG DAYS LONG A CONSTANT WEIGHT THE YOKE OF ABSOLUTE DESPAIR
OR I SHOULD HAVE RESTORED IT
SINCE OLD TOM JARNDYCE IN DESPAIR BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT AT A COFFEE HOUSE IN CHANCERY LANE BUT JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE STILL DRAGS ITS DREARY LENGTH BEFORE THE COURT PERENNIALLY HOPELESS
IN THE BLACK DRESS THAT SHE STILL WEARS TEACHING MY RICHARD I FEEL
LIKE CHARMERS REDUCED TO FLIRTING WITH GRIM DEATH AFTER LOSING ALL THEIR OTHER BEAUX DID ONCE OCCASIONALLY SAY WHEN THE WORLD ASSEMBLED TOGETHER THAT THEY WONDERED THE ASHES OF THE DEDLOCKS ENTOMBED IN THE MAUSOLEUM
I WAS SITTING OUT IN THE PORCH OF ALL PLACES THAT DEARLY MEMORABLE PORCH WHEN ALLAN CAME HOME SO HE SAID MY PRECIOUS LITTLE WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND I SAID
AND ITS SMOKE MOVES IN A TARDY LITTLE CLOUD TOWARDS THE GREEN RISE COPPICE TOPPED THAT MAKES A BACKGROUND FOR THE FALLING RAIN THE VIEW FROM MY LADY DEDLOCK'S OWN WINDOWS
THE SORROW THAT HAS BEEN IN HER FACE FOR IT IS NOT THERE NOW SEEMS TO HAVE PURIFIED EVEN ITS INNOCENT EXPRESSION AND TO HAVE GIVEN IT A DIVINER QUALITY SOMETIMES WHEN I RAISE MY EYES AND SEE HER
BUT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED AND HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PARSIMONY OF THE PUBLIC WHICH GUILTY PUBLIC IT APPEARED HAD BEEN UNTIL LATELY BENT IN THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER
IN THE POLISHING AT HARNESS HOUSE DOORS OF STIRRUP IRONS BITS CURB CHAINS HARNESS BOSSES ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF A STABLE YARD THAT WILL TAKE A POLISH LEADING A LIFE OF FRICTION A SHAGGY LITTLE DAMAGED MAN WITHAL
THE CHANCELLOR IS ABOUT TO BOW TO THE BAR WHEN THE PRISONER IS PRESENTED NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY COME OF THE PRISONER'S CONGLOMERATION BUT HIS BEING SENT BACK TO PRISON WHICH IS SOON DONE
FOG IN THE EYES AND THROATS OF ANCIENT GREENWICH PENSIONERS WHEEZING BY THE FIRESIDES OF THEIR WARDS FOG IN THE STEM AND BOWL OF THE AFTERNOON PIPE OF THE WRATHFUL SKIPPER
WHEN ALL THE STOPPED SPITS IN THE KITCHEN SHALL BEGIN TO TURN PRODIGIOUSLY IT IS NOT A LARGE WORLD RELATIVELY EVEN TO THIS WORLD OF OURS WHICH HAS ITS LIMITS TOO
RINGING IN THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE VERY LITTLE COUNSEL DROPS AND THE FOG KNOWS HIM NO MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR HIM NOBODY CAN SEE HIM I WILL SPEAK WITH BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
GAS LOOMING THROUGH THE FOG IN DIVERS PLACES IN THE STREETS MUCH AS THE SUN MAY FROM THE SPONGEY FIELDS BE SEEN TO LOOM BY HUSBANDMAN AND PLOUGHBOY
WHICH HAS ITS RUINED SUITOR WITH HIS SLIPSHOD HEELS AND THREADBARE DRESS BORROWING AND BEGGING THROUGH THE ROUND OF EVERY MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE WHICH GIVES TO MONIED MIGHT THE MEANS ABUNDANTLY OF WEARYING OUT THE RIGHT
IT WAS IN SOME OFF HAND MANNER NEVER MEANT TO GO RIGHT THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE MUD AND AT THE HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
AND ARE COME TO THE BRINK OF THE VOID BEYOND IT IS A VERY LITTLE SPECK THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN IT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND TRUE PEOPLE IN IT IT HAS ITS APPOINTED PLACE BUT THE EVIL OF IT IS
TO ADDRESS THE CHANCELLOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY'S BUSINESS AND WHO CAN BY NO MEANS BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS LEGALLY IGNORANT OF HIS EXISTENCE AFTER MAKING IT DESOLATE
A FEW LAWYERS CLERKS AND OTHERS WHO KNOW THIS SUITOR BY SIGHT LINGER ON THE CHANCE OF HIS FURNISHING SOME FUN AND ENLIVENING THE DISMAL WEATHER A LITTLE JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE DRONES ON
THE APPEARANCES BEYOND ALL RATIONAL DOUBT OBSERVED IN THAT CASE ARE THE APPEARANCES OBSERVED IN MISTER KROOK'S CASE THE NEXT MOST FAMOUS
A PLACE WHERE FEW PEOPLE CARE TO GO ABOUT ALONE WHERE A MAID SCREAMS IF AN ASH DROPS FROM THE FIRE TAKES TO CRYING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS BECOMES THE VICTIM OF A LOW DISORDER OF THE SPIRITS AND GIVES WARNING AND DEPARTS
BY A LARGE ADVOCATE WITH GREAT WHISKERS A LITTLE VOICE AND AN INTERMINABLE BRIEF AND OUTWARDLY DIRECTING HIS CONTEMPLATION TO THE LANTERN IN THE ROOF WHERE HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT FOG
HER DEAREST COUSIN JOHN BUT HE SAID NO IT MUST BE GUARDIAN NOW HE WAS HER GUARDIAN HENCEFORTH AND THE BOY'S AND HE HAD AN OLD ASSOCIATION WITH THE NAME
FAIR WARDS OF COURT HAVE FADED INTO MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS A LONG PROCESSION OF CHANCELLORS HAS COME IN AND GONE OUT THE LEGION OF BILLS IN THE SUIT HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO MERE BILLS OF MORTALITY
AND SO EASY WITH HIM THAT I ALMOST WONDER AT MYSELF I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD NAMES NOR HAS HE LOST HIS NOR DO I EVER WHEN HE IS WITH US SIT IN ANY OTHER PLACE THAN IN MY OLD CHAIR AT HIS SIDE
FULLY INFLATED IN THE BACK SETTLEMENTS OF THE FOG AND SAYS WILL YOUR LORDSHIP ALLOW ME I APPEAR FOR HIM HE IS A COUSIN SEVERAL TIMES REMOVED I AM NOT AT THE MOMENT PREPARED TO INFORM THE COURT
HAS BEEN MADE BETTER BY IT IN TRICKERY EVASION PROCRASTINATION SPOLIATION BOTHERATION UNDER FALSE PRETENCES OF ALL SORTS THERE ARE INFLUENCES THAT CAN NEVER COME TO GOOD
AS LITTLE DOES HE THINK HOW NEAR TOGETHER HE AND HIS ANTAGONIST HAVE SUFFERED IN THE FORTUNES OF TWO SISTERS AND HIS ANTAGONIST WHO KNOWS IT NOW IS NOT THE MAN TO TELL HIM SO THE QUARREL GOES ON
RIDING WITH A STALWART MAN BESIDE HIM CONSTANT TO HIS BRIDLE REIN WHEN THEY COME TO A CERTAIN SPOT BEFORE THE MAUSOLEUM DOOR SIR LEICESTER'S ACCUSTOMED HORSE STOPS OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND SIR LEICESTER PULLING OFF HIS HAT
AITS AND MEADOWS FOG DOWN THE RIVER WHERE IT ROLLS DEFILED AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING AND THE WATERSIDE POLLUTIONS OF A GREAT AND DIRTY CITY FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS
HE IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY EVER TO DO IN THE MEANTIME HIS PROSPECTS IN LIFE ARE ENDED ANOTHER RUINED SUITOR WHO PERIODICALLY APPEARS FROM SHROPSHIRE AND BREAKS OUT INTO EFFORTS
IS ALL MYSTERY SOME OF HER OLD FRIENDS PRINCIPALLY TO BE FOUND AMONG THE PEACHY CHEEKED CHARMERS WITH THE SKELETON THROATS DID ONCE OCCASIONALLY SAY AS THEY TOYED IN A GHASTLY MANNER WITH LARGE FANS
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IN LEGAL COURT SUITS THESE ARE ALL YAWNING FOR NO CRUMB OF AMUSEMENT EVER FALLS FROM JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE CAUSE IN HAND
AND ALWAYS EXPECTING SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE JUDGMENT TO BE GIVEN IN HER FAVOUR
IS STILL BELIEVED IN IN THE OLD WAY HE IS CONSTANT IN HIS PATRONAGE OF PEEPY AND IS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEQUEATHED HIM
SHOWING HOW BUFFY IS IMMACULATE AND BOODLE VILLAINOUS AND HOW THE COUNTRY IS LOST BY BEING ALL BOODLE AND NO BUFFY OR SAVED BY BEING ALL BUFFY AND NO BOODLE
FRENCH ENGLISH AND SCOTCH IN MORE MODERN DAYS CONTENTING MYSELF WITH OBSERVING THAT I SHALL NOT ABANDON THE FACTS UNTIL THERE SHALL HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF THE TESTIMONY ON WHICH HUMAN OCCURRENCES
HE IS MY HUSBAND'S BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND HE IS OUR CHILDREN'S DARLING HE IS THE OBJECT OF OUR DEEPEST LOVE AND VENERATION YET WHILE I FEEL TOWARDS HIM AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING I AM SO FAMILIAR WITH HIM
AND AT HER HOUSE IN TOWN UPON THIS MUDDY MURKY AFTERNOON PRESENTS HIMSELF AN OLD FASHIONED OLD GENTLEMAN ATTORNEY AT LAW AND EKE SOLICITOR OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
EVERYBODY KNOWS OR HAS SOME REASON TO KNOW BY THIS TIME THE MATTER HAVING BEEN RATHER FREQUENTLY MENTIONED MY LADY DEDLOCK HAVING CONQUERED HER WORLD FELL NOT INTO THE MELTING BUT RATHER
THEY GAVE MY DARLING INTO MY ARMS AND THROUGH MANY WEEKS I NEVER LEFT HER THE LITTLE CHILD WHO WAS TO HAVE DONE SO MUCH WAS BORN BEFORE THE TURF WAS PLANTED ON ITS FATHER'S GRAVE IT WAS A BOY
TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH IN ONE OF THE LODGES OF THE PARK THAT LODGE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WATERS WERE OUT DOWN IN LINCOLNSHIRE MY LADY USED TO SEE THE KEEPER'S CHILD THE STALWART MAN
AND BY THE DRAWL LANGUIDLY ECHOING TO THE ROOF FROM THE PADDED DAIS WHERE THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LOOKS INTO THE LANTERN THAT HAS NO LIGHT IN IT AND WHERE THE ATTENDANT WIGS ARE ALL STUCK IN A FOG BANK
THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE CRIES MY LORD MACES BAGS AND PURSES INDIGNANTLY PROCLAIM SILENCE AND FROWN AT THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE IN REFERENCE PROCEEDS THE CHANCELLOR
I TRY TO WRITE ALL THIS LIGHTLY BECAUSE MY HEART IS FULL IN DRAWING TO AN END BUT WHEN I WRITE OF HIM MY TEARS WILL HAVE THEIR WAY I NEVER LOOK AT HIM BUT I HEAR
IN HIM INDEED HE MARRIED HER FOR LOVE A WHISPER STILL GOES ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN FAMILY
UPON WHOSE IMPALING FILES REAMS OF DUSTY WARRANTS
OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
AND IT KNOWS ALL FASHIONABLE THINGS TO KNOW THINGS OTHERWISE WERE TO BE UNFASHIONABLE MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN DOWN AT WHAT SHE CALLS IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION
NEVER ROSE AGAINST THE PROFANATION OF HER COMPANY BUT THE DEAD AND GONE DEDLOCKS TAKE IT VERY CALMLY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO OBJECT UP FROM AMONG THE FERN IN THE HOLLOW
AND HOLDS HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS IN THE HIGHEST ESTIMATION HIS GALLANTRY TO MY LADY WHICH HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE HE COURTED HER
I WILL SEE THEM AND SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF MAKING THE ORDER FOR THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR UNCLE MISTER TANGLE ON HIS LEGS AGAIN BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON DEAD WITH THEIR
WITH ONE OR OTHER OF WHOM I THINK IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN SUCH MOUTHS I MIGHT HAVE COUPLED IT WITH AN APT QUOTATION FROM ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS MY NATURE IS SUBDUED
ARE THE STAPLE OF HER READING SIR LEICESTER IS NOT PARTICULAR WHAT IT IS AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO FOLLOW IT VERY CLOSELY FURTHER THAN THAT HE ALWAYS COMES BROAD AWAKE THE MOMENT VOLUMNIA VENTURES TO LEAVE OFF
FOR HALF A MILE IN BREADTH IS A STAGNANT RIVER WITH MELANCHOLY TREES FOR ISLANDS IN IT AND A SURFACE PUNCTURED ALL OVER ALL DAY LONG WITH FALLING RAIN
MISTER BOYTHORN SHOWED A MANIFEST DESIRE TO ABANDON HIS RIGHT OF WAY AND DO WHATEVER SIR LEICESTER WOULD WHICH SIR LEICESTER CONCEIVING TO BE A CONDESCENSION TO HIS ILLNESS OR MISFORTUNE TOOK IN SUCH HIGH DUDGEON AND WAS SO MAGNIFICENTLY AGGRIEVED BY
MY LADY DEDLOCK'S PLACE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DREARY THE WEATHER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT HAS BEEN SO WET THAT THE TREES SEEM WET THROUGH
THIS SCARECROW OF A SUIT HAS IN COURSE OF TIME BECOME SO COMPLICATED THAT NO MAN ALIVE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS THE PARTIES TO IT UNDERSTAND IT LEAST BUT IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT NO TWO CHANCERY LAWYERS
THE LIGHT OF THE DRAWING ROOM SEEMS GRADUALLY CONTRACTING AND DWINDLING UNTIL IT SHALL BE NO MORE A LITTLE MORE IN TRUTH AND IT WILL BE ALL EXTINGUISHED FOR SIR LEICESTER AND THE DAMP DOOR IN THE MAUSOLEUM WHICH SHUTS SO TIGHT
SUCH FERNAL OLD JAIL'S NOUGH T'SEW FLER UP FREVER THE ONLY GREAT OCCASIONS FOR VOLUMNIA IN THIS CHANGED ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE ARE THOSE OCCASIONS RARE AND WIDELY SEPARATED
HE HAS A TWIST OF THE GOUT NOW AND THEN AND WALKS A LITTLE STIFFLY HE IS OF A WORTHY PRESENCE WITH HIS LIGHT GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS HIS FINE SHIRT FRILL
ABOUT MY OLD LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE
LIES IN THE MAUSOLEUM IN THE PARK WHERE THE TREES ARCH DARKLY OVERHEAD AND THE OWL IS HEARD AT NIGHT MAKING THE WOODS RING BUT WHENCE SHE WAS BROUGHT HOME TO BE LAID AMONG THE ECHOES OF THAT SOLITARY PLACE OR HOW SHE DIED
TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY ALL AUTHORITIES PUBLISHED SOME INGENIOUS LETTERS TO ME AT THE TIME WHEN THAT EVENT WAS CHRONICLED ARGUING THAT SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE
THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OUGHT TO BE SITTING HERE AS HERE HE IS WITH A FOGGY GLORY ROUND HIS HEAD SOFTLY FENCED IN WITH CRIMSON CLOTH AND CURTAINS ADDRESSED
TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND BOY THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE MISTER TANGLE CRUSHED WHOM I DIRECTED TO BE IN ATTENDANCE TO DAY AND WHO ARE NOW IN MY PRIVATE ROOM
MAKE EIGHTEEN BOWS AND DROP INTO THEIR EIGHTEEN PLACES OF OBSCURITY WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE HEARING ON WEDNESDAY FORTNIGHT SAYS THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IS ONLY A QUESTION OF COSTS
AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAS PASSED ALONG THE OLD ROOMS SHUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN THEY WILL NEXT COME FORTH AGAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH LIKE THE FIEND
JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS PASSED INTO A JOKE
SAID ALLAN I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE LOVED ME ANY BETTER EVEN IF I HAD RETAINED THEM SUCH AS THEY WERE SAID ALLAN LAUGHING
ROUND EYED STILL AND NOT AT ALL GRAMMATICAL IS MARRIED TO A MILLER IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD YET SO IT IS AND EVEN NOW LOOKING UP FROM MY DESK AS I WRITE EARLY IN THE MORNING AT MY SUMMER WINDOW I SEE THE VERY MILL BEGINNING TO GO ROUND
NO FLAG FLYING NOW BY DAY NO ROWS OF LIGHTS SPARKLING BY NIGHT WITH NO FAMILY TO COME AND GO NO VISITORS TO BE THE SOULS OF PALE COLD SHAPES OF ROOMS NO STIR OF LIFE ABOUT IT
AND WERE CONSTANTLY BEING JUGGLED THROUGH THE WHOLE SET ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE PASSAGES AND THROUGH THE ROOMS WHICH ARE VERY BRILLIANT IN THE SEASON AND VERY DISMAL OUT OF IT
THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
AND IS DRIVEN TO VARIOUS ARTIFICES TO CONCEAL HER YAWNS OF WHICH THE CHIEF AND MOST EFFICACIOUS IS THE INSERTION OF THE PEARL NECKLACE BETWEEN HER ROSY LIPS LONG WINDED TREATISES ON THE BUFFY AND BOODLE QUESTION
I HAVE BEEN THE MISTRESS OF BLEAK HOUSE
THEN IS A FIFE HEARD TROLLING WITHIN THE LODGE ON THE INSPIRING TOPIC OF THE BRITISH GRENADIERS AND AS THE EVENING CLOSES IN A GRUFF INFLEXIBLE VOICE IS HEARD TO SAY WHILE TWO MEN PACE TOGETHER UP AND DOWN BUT
THAT MISTER BOYTHORN FOUND HIMSELF UNDER THE NECESSITY OF COMMITTING A FLAGRANT TRESPASS TO RESTORE HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIMSELF SIMILARLY MISTER BOYTHORN CONTINUES TO POST TREMENDOUS PLACARDS ON THE DISPUTED THOROUGHFARE
PEEPY IS IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE AND DOING EXTREMELY WELL OLD MISTER TURVEYDROP VERY APOPLECTIC STILL EXHIBITS HIS DEPORTMENT ABOUT TOWN STILL ENJOYS HIMSELF IN THE OLD MANNER
AND IT WOULD NOT BE WONDERFUL TO MEET A MEGALOSAURUS FORTY FEET LONG OR SO
BUT IMPROVED INTO CLASSICALITY BY THE ACQUIRED EXPRESSION OF HER FASHIONABLE STATE HER FIGURE IS ELEGANT AND HAS THE EFFECT OF BEING TALL NOT THAT SHE IS SO BUT THAT
DOWN IN HIS CLOSE CABIN FOG CRUELLY PINCHING THE TOES AND FINGERS OF HIS SHIVERING LITTLE PRENTICE BOY ON DECK
UPON CRUST OF MUD STICKING AT THOSE POINTS TENACIOUSLY TO THE PAVEMENT AND ACCUMULATING AT COMPOUND INTEREST FOG EVERYWHERE FOG UP THE RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS AMONG GREEN
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY NEVER CAN THERE COME FOG TOO THICK NEVER CAN THERE COME MUD AND MIRE TOO DEEP
AT ALL EVENTS FEELING'S PALE REFLECTION JUST SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY BE WITNESSED WHEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT A DROWNING MAN MAKES A LAST RE APPEARANCE ON THE SURFACE OF A RIVER AND THERE RISES FROM THE CROWD LINING
UNTIL I THOUGHT HE MUST THINK ME MAD
WHY SHOULD I MAKE OFF WITH IT TWOULD BE OF NO USE TO ME FOR I CAN NEITHER READ NOR WRITE YOU LIE YOU HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY FOR THE SEXTON TO SCRIBBLE UPON
LASTLY THE MONEY CONCEALED
HAD THE WINDOWS OPENED BUT I DID HAVE THEM OPENED REPLIED PETRUSHKA NEVERTHELESS THIS WAS A LIE AS CHICHIKOV WELL KNEW THOUGH HE WAS TOO TIRED TO CONTEST THE POINT AFTER ORDERING AND CONSUMING A LIGHT SUPPER OF SUCKING PIG
AT LENGTH IN A STATE BORDERING UPON BEWILDERMENT HE RETURNED TO THE INN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT WHENCE THAT EVERY AFTERNOON HE HAD SET FORTH IN SUCH EXUBERANCE OF SPIRITS FEELING THE NEED OF SOMETHING TO DO HE ORDERED TEA
I AM ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
INDEED SUCH WAS THE INTEREST TAKEN BY CERTAIN CITIZENS IN THE MATTER THAT THEY ADVISED THE PURCHASER TO PROVIDE HIMSELF AND HIS CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL AT THE APPOINTED DESTINATION
ONE CAN NEVER TRUST THESE FELLOWS PRESENTLY WHEN PROSHKA AND THE BOOTS HAD DEPARTED HE FELL TO GAZING AT HIS GUEST WITH AN EQUALLY DISTRUSTFUL AIR SINCE CERTAIN FEATURES IN CHICHIKOV'S BENEVOLENCE NOW STRUCK HIM
OH DEAR NO HAD THAT BEEN ALL
IN ORDER THAT AT LEAST IT MIGHT BE LEARNT
LOSING A PILE OF MONEY AT PLAY MY WORD YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED A FELLOW WITH ME NAMED PEREPENDEV SAID WOULD THAT CHICHIKOV HAD BEEN HERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE VERY THING FOR HIM
WHEN ALL THE TIME THERE WAS THE TAVERN AND THE HIGHROAD AND OTHER PLACES TO RESORT TO SUDDENLY A WOMAN APPEARED FROM AN OUTBUILDING APPARENTLY THE HOUSEKEEPER OF THE MANSION BUT SO ROUGHLY AND DIRTILY DRESSED AS ALMOST TO SEEM INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A MAN
TELL YOUR MAN TO FILL ME A PIPE WHERE IS YOUR OWN PIPE I NEVER SMOKE REJOINED CHICHIKOV DRILY RUBBISH AS IF I DID NOT KNOW WHAT A CHIMNEY POT YOU ARE WHAT IS YOUR MAN'S NAME HI VAKHRAMEI COME HERE
THEN SHOUTED THE SAMOVAR WILL NOT BE NEEDED RETURN THE SUGAR TO MAVRA AND TELL HER TO PUT IT BACK AGAIN BUT NO BRING THE SUGAR HERE AND I WILL PUT IT BACK GOOD BYE DEAR SIR FINALLY HE ADDED TO CHICHIKOV
ALSO IN ADDITION TO THE GREAT DIVERGENCY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED THEREAT THERE WAS VISIBLE IN ALL THE SPEAKERS AN INVINCIBLE TENDENCY TO INDECISION WHICH LED THEM AT ONE MOMENT TO MAKE ASSERTIONS
HIS EMOTION WAS SUCH THAT HE COULD NOT FORMULATE A SINGLE INTELLIGIBLE SYLLABLE HE COULD MERELY MURMUR THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT THOUGH CERTAINLY NOTHING OF THE KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE RISEN TO THE LIPS OF THE HERO OF A FASHIONABLE NOVEL
MANY OF THEIR ROOFS WERE RIDDLED WITH HOLES OTHERS HAD BUT A TILE OF THE ROOF REMAINING AND YET OTHERS WERE REDUCED TO THE RIB LIKE FRAMEWORK OF THE SAME IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THE INHABITANTS THEMSELVES HAD REMOVED THE LATHS AND TRAVERSES ON THE VERY NATURAL PLEA
THE NEWLY ARRIVED DIRECTOR HAVING MADE HIS INSPECTION THE SAID OFFICIALS ARE BEGINNING TO GET OVER THEIR FIRST SENSE OF AWE ON PERCEIVING THAT HE HAS FOUND MUCH TO COMMEND AND THAT HE CAN EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO JEST AND UTTER A FEW WORDS OF SMILING APPROVAL
WELL HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF LET THEM DO WHAT THEY LIKE WITH ME AT THE COMMISSION BUT I INTEND TO GO AND RAISE THE WHOLE PLACE AND TO TELL EVERY BLESSED FUNCTIONARY THERE THAT I HAVE A MIND TO DO AS I CHOOSE
HE HAD NEVER EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER CHICHIKOV POSSESSED A FAMILY NEXT HE SHUFFLED TO THE WINDOW AND TAPPING ONE OF ITS PANES SHOUTED THE NAME OF
AND HOW HE DROPPED INTO A TAVERN FOR A GLASS OF VODKA AND HOW HE ORDERED A CUTLET AND SOME CAPER SAUCE AND SOME OTHER THINGS FOR LUNCHEON AND HOW HE CALLED FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE AND HOW HE WENT TO THE THEATRE IN THE EVENING IN SHORT HE DID HIMSELF THOROUGHLY WELL
AND THE VISITOR'S BREATHING BECAME MORE HURRIED AND FURTHER WORDS SEEMED TO BE HOVERING BETWEEN HER LIPS LIKE HAWKS PREPARING TO STOOP UPON THEIR PREY ONLY A PERSON OF THE UNHUMANITY OF A TRUE FRIEND WOULD HAVE HAD THE HEART TO INTERRUPT HER
A MAN OF GOOD SOCIETY WHERESOEVER ONE MAY BE A MAN OF THAT KIND NEVER EATS ANYTHING
HOWEVER THE LAWS OF RUSSIAN HOSPITALITY DO NOT PERMIT EVEN OF A MISER INFRINGING THEIR RULES WHEREFORE PLUSHKIN ADDED TO THE FOREGOING
WITH TOOTHLESS GUMS PLUSHKIN MURMURED SOMETHING IN REPLY BUT NOTHING IS KNOWN AS TO ITS PRECISE TERMS BEYOND THAT IT INCLUDED A STATEMENT THAT THE DEVIL WAS AT LIBERTY TO FLY AWAY WITH CHICHIKOV'S SENTIMENTS
BUT SO PUT ABOUT WAS THAT OFFICIAL BY CHICHIKOV'S ENTRY THAT HE COULD NOT UTTER TWO CONSECUTIVE WORDS HE COULD ONLY MURMUR SOME RUBBISH WHICH LEFT BOTH HIS VISITOR AND HIMSELF OUT OF COUNTENANCE
IS SHE A YOUNG WOMAN OR GOOD LOOKING OH DEAR NO QUITE AN OLD WOMAN SPLENDID INDEED
MY DEAREST MADAM SAID MY MAID MASHKA PRAY LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SEE HOW WHITE YOU ARE BUT I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT I REPLIED AS I MUST BE OFF TO TELL MY FRIEND ANNA GRIGORIEVNA
YES WE ALL KNOW WHY BRIBES ARE ACCEPTED AND WHY MEN BECOME CROOKED IN SOUL IT IS ALL DONE TO PROVIDE WIVES YES MAY THE PIT SWALLOW THEM UP WITH FAL LALS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE
EVERY MOMENT SHE KEPT LOOKING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND PERCEIVING WITH ALMOST SPEECHLESS VEXATION THAT AS YET SHE WAS BUT HALF WAY ON HER JOURNEY
BUT I USED TO POSSESS A SPLENDID BOTTLE OF LIQUOR PROBABLY THE SERVANTS HAVE DRUNK IT ALL FOR THEY ARE SUCH THIEVES
THE PRESIDENT WILL SOON BE HERE
AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NEVER A BITE OF ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE SO HE HAS TO GO AWAY EMPTY BUT ABOUT THE LIST OF THOSE GOOD FOR NOTHING SOULS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS SUCH A LIST
BUT ON HIS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING FURTHER HIS TONGUE COMPLETELY FAILED HIM THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ADDED A WORD OR TWO AND THEN CARRIED OFF HER DAUGHTER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE OTHER GUESTS CHICHIKOV STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT
AGAIN AND AGAIN DID HE STRIVE TO DIVINE THE CAUSE BUT COULD NOT DO SO SO HE WENT WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT THE TOWN WITHOUT SUCCEEDING IN MAKING UP HIS MIND WHETHER HE OR THE OFFICIALS HAD GONE CRAZY
QUITE SO A DEED OF PURCHASE ECHOED PLUSHKIN ONCE MORE RELAPSING INTO THOUGHT AND THE CHEWING MOTION OF THE LIPS
AND IS EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN THE DREADED BLACK DEATH ALSO TO ADD TO THE TCHINOVNIKS TROUBLES
ONE MAY HEARTILY COMMEND THE TASTE OF OUR LADIES FOR HAVING FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM NEVERTHELESS IT IS NOT AS YOU SUPPOSE THINK NOW
HE FELT MUCH AS DOES A MAN WHO SHOD WITH WELL POLISHED BOOTS HAS JUST STEPPED INTO A DIRTY STINKING PUDDLE HE TRIED TO PUT AWAY FROM HIM THE OCCURRENCE AND TO EXPAND AND TO ENJOY HIMSELF ONCE MORE NAY HE EVEN TOOK A HAND AT WHIST
AND THE ADVENT OF A NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL HE FELT UTTERLY DISMAYED THINGS HAVING COME TO THEIR PRESENT PASS HE REFLECTED I HAD BETTER NOT LINGER HERE I HAD BETTER BE OFF AT ONCE GETTING RID OF NOZDREV AS SOON AS HE COULD
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HER HORSES WERE NOT SHOD SHE HAD SET OFF FOR THE TOWN IN ORDER TO LEARN AT FIRST HAND HOW THE DEAD SOULS WERE FARING AND WHETHER WHICH MIGHT GOD FORFEND SHE HAD NOT SOLD THEM AT SOMETHING LIKE A THIRD OF THEIR TRUE VALUE
WHEREAS I SCARCELY GET ENOUGH TO EAT I WILL TAKE ANY PRICE FOR THEM THAT YOU MAY CARE TO OFFER TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND SHOULD THEY FIND
BUT THAT WAS A TRIFLE SINCE THE QUATRAIN AT LEAST CONFORMED TO THE MODE THEN PREVALENT
HOWEVER CHICHIKOV SLIPPED PAST THE MAZURKA DANCERS AND ALMOST TREADING ON THEIR HEELS MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE MADAME AND HER DAUGHTER WERE SEATED YET HE APPROACHED THEM WITH GREAT DIFFIDENCE AND NONE OF HIS LATE MINCING AND PRANCING
UNTIL A SUDDEN SHOUT AROSE FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE POSTMASTER WHO FOR SOME TIME PAST HAD BEEN SITTING PLUNGED IN THOUGHT I CAN TELL YOU HE CRIED WHO CHICHIKOV IS WHO THEN REPLIED THE CROWD IN GREAT EXCITEMENT
WHEREUPON THERE ENSUED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION
TO RIGHT AND LEFT DID HE INCLINE HIS HEAD IN THE SIDELONG YET UNCONSTRAINED MANNER THAT WAS HIS WONT AND NEVER FAILED TO CHARM THE BEHOLDER AS FOR THE LADIES THEY CLUSTERED AROUND HIM IN A SHINING BEVY THAT WAS REDOLENT OF EVERY SPECIES OF PERFUME
THERE WAS SENT HOME WOUNDED A CERTAIN CAPTAIN KOPEIKIN A HEADSTRONG LIVELY BLADE WHO WHETHER ON DUTY OR UNDER ARREST MADE THINGS LIVELY FOR EVERYBODY NOW
AND TAKING UP A PEN SAT TURNING THE SHEET OF PAPER OVER AND OVER AS THOUGH IN DOUBT WHETHER TO TEAR FROM IT YET ANOTHER MORSEL AT LENGTH HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO AND THEREFORE DIPPING THE PEN
I CONFESS THAT THE WORDS PASS MY UNDERSTANDING CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HEARD SPEAK OF THOSE SOULS TRUE MY HUSBAND AVERS THAT NOZDREV WAS LYING YET IN HIS LIES THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A GRAIN OF TRUTH WELL
HE ASKED AS SUBSEQUENTLY HE FOLDED THE LETTER WHAT YOU HAVE SOME RUNAWAYS AS WELL EXCLAIMED CHICHIKOV AGAIN GREATLY INTERESTED CERTAINLY I HAVE MY SON IN LAW HAS LAID THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AGAINST THEM
AND IF SO HE WILL GET ON BADLY WITH THE DVORIANE SEEING THAT FELLOWS OF THAT SORT NEED TO BE HUMOURED A BIT YES MY WORD SHOULD THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS STUDY AND GIVE NO BALLS THERE WILL BE THE VERY DEVIL TO PAY
AND THE RECEPTION OF THE TWO SERIOUS DOCUMENTS ABOVE MENTIONED HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES UPON THE FEATURES OF EVERY ONE PRESENT MORE THAN ONE FROCKCOAT HAD COME TO LOOK TOO LARGE FOR ITS WEARER AND MORE THAN ONE FRAME HAD FALLEN AWAY
BAD WOMAN WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU ROBBED YOUR MASTER AND THEN STOKE UP THE FIRE STILL HOTTER NEVERTHELESS I SHALL CONTINUE TO SAY YOU ARE ROASTING ME FOR NOTHING
BY THE TIME THEY REACHED THE TOWN DARKNESS HAD FALLEN AND CHANGED THE CHARACTER OF THE SCENE THE BRITCHKA BOUNDED OVER THE COBBLESTONES
THAT THE HUTS WERE NO PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAIN AND THEREFORE SINCE THE LATTER ENTERED IN BUCKETFULS
NO NOT UNTIL I HAVE LEARNT WHAT ALL THIS PURCHASING OF DEAD PEASANTS MEANS LOOK HERE YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YES I SAY THAT I WHO AM ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS HERE HE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR AGAIN
AND HE GOT UP EARLY ONE MORNING AND SHAVED HIMSELF WITH HIS LEFT HAND
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE MIGHT BE A MILLIONAIRE AND INCLUDE IN HIS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE AN INDEFINABLE ELEMENT OF GRANDNESS AND MARTIAL ARDOUR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH NO LADY WILL PARDON WHOSOEVER BE THE PERSON CONCERNED
ARE SUFFERING FOR YOUR OWN GOODNESS OF HEART BY GOD THAT IS TRUE THAT IS TRUE PLUSHKIN HUNG HIS HEAD AND WAGGED IT FEEBLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE YES
WITH THAT PLUSHKIN DONNED HIS SPECTACLES AND ONCE MORE STARTED TO RUMMAGE IN THE CUPBOARD AND TO SMOTHER HIS GUEST WITH DUST AS HE UNTIED SUCCESSIVE PACKAGES OF PAPERS SO MUCH SO THAT HIS VICTIM BURST OUT SNEEZING
YOU SEE SAINT PETERSBURG LIFE HAD CHANGED HIM NOT A LITTLE SINCE FIRST HE HAD GOT A TASTE OF IT AND NOW THAT THE DEVIL ONLY KNEW HOW HE WAS GOING TO LIVE
NAY THE NARRATIVE AS DETAILED BY NOZDREV EVEN REACHED THE POINT OF HIS MENTIONING CERTAIN OF THE POSTILLIONS BY NAME NEXT THE TCHINOVNIKS SOUNDED HIM ON THE QUESTION OF CHICHIKOV'S POSSIBLE IDENTITY WITH NAPOLEON BUT BEFORE LONG THEY HAD REASON TO REGRET THE STEP
BUT PRESENTLY A VIOLENT JOLT AROUSED HIM TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS DRIVING OVER WOODEN PAVEMENTS OF A KIND COMPARED WITH WHICH THE COBBLESTONES OF THE TOWN HAD BEEN AS NOTHING LIKE THE KEYS OF A PIANO THE PLANKS KEPT RISING AND FALLING
AS ALSO THAT HIS VAGUE REFERENCES TO HIMSELF HAD YES INCLUDED STATEMENTS THAT HIS CAREER IN THE SERVICE
ACCORDINGLY HE RAISED A TURMOIL WHICH SENT THE STAFF FLYING ONE BY ONE HE GAVE THE MOB OF SECRETARIES AND CLERKS A REAL GOOD HAMMERING YOU AND YOU AND YOU HE SAID DO NOT EVEN KNOW YOUR DUTIES YOU ARE LAW BREAKERS YES HE TROD EVERY MAN OF THEM UNDER FOOT
HE PASSED INTO AN EQUALLY DARK PARLOUR THAT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY SUCH RAYS AS CONTRIVED TO FILTER THROUGH A CRACK UNDER THE DOOR WHEN CHICHIKOV OPENED THE DOOR IN QUESTION THE SPECTACLE OF THE UNTIDINESS WITHIN STRUCK HIM ALMOST WITH AMAZEMENT
OF COURSE I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU TO BE ANYTHING OF THE KIND BUT YOU SEE THESE FELLOWS ARE IN A BLUE FUNK ABOUT THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL FOR THEY THINK HE WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR THEM OVER YOUR AFFAIR A PROPOS HE IS BELIEVED TO BE A MAN WHO PUTS ON AIRS AND TURNS UP HIS NOSE AT EVERYTHING
I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT CHICHIKOV COULD EASILY HAVE ALLEGED A BETTER REASON
NEXT TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT HE CONSIDERED CHICHIKOV TO BE A SPY HE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND ADDED THAT AS LONG AGO AS HIS AND CHICHIKOV'S JOINT SCHOOLDAYS THE SAID CHICHIKOV HAD BEEN KNOWN AS THE INFORMER
NOR WERE HIS COLLEAGUES A WIT INFERIOR TO HIM IN ENLIGHTENMENT FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THEM MADE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF READING KARAMZIN ANOTHER OF CONNING THE MOSCOW GAZETTE AND A THIRD OF NEVER LOOKING AT A BOOK AT ALL
NAMES SUCH AS OLD WOMEN PETTICOATS
TRULY IT WRINGS ONE'S HEART TO SEE TO WHAT LENGTHS IMMORALITY HAS COME SOME OF THE MEN HAVE QUITE LOST THEIR HEADS ABOUT HER BUT FOR MY PART I THINK HER NOT WORTH NOTICING OF COURSE AND HER MANNERS ARE UNBEARABLE
EVER POSSESSED HAS EITHER LEFT ME OR IS DEAD BUT STOP A MOMENT
BUT IN EACH CASE HE EITHER FAILED TO BE ACCORDED ADMITTANCE OR WAS RECEIVED SO STRANGELY AND WITH SUCH A MEASURE OF CONSTRAINT AND CONVERSATIONAL AWKWARDNESS AND ABSENCE OF MIND AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT HE BEGAN TO FEAR FOR THE SANITY OF HIS HOSTS
PLUSHKIN'S VERY EYES FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE CHEWED SILENTLY
ONE REASON WHY THE MEN'S PARTY WAS SO CERTAIN THAT THE DEAD SOULS CONNOTED SOMETHING CONTRARY TO GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE WAS THAT THERE HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED
AND REPEATEDLY BEEN THRASHED BY HIS COMPANIONS ON THAT ACCOUNT AGAIN TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT CHICHIKOV WAS A FORGER OF CURRENCY NOTES THE DEPONENT AS BEFORE RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
ENCLOSING A CATERPILLAR LASTLY IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM LAY A PILE OF ARTICLES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ADJUDGED UNWORTHY OF A PLACE ON THE TABLE YET WHAT THE PILE CONSISTED OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SAY
AND SET OUT WOODEN LEG AND ALL TO SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION BUT FIRST HE ASKED WHERE THE PRESIDENT LIVED AND WAS TOLD THAT HIS HOUSE WAS IN NABEREZHNAIA STREET AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IT WAS NO PEASANT'S HUT
VERY WELL HE SAID SINCE YOU DECLINE TO REST SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU AND QUIETLY TO AWAIT THE DECISION OF YOUR CASE IN SAINT PETERSBURG I MUST FIND YOU A LODGING HERE CONSTABLE
HAD DECIDED TO ABDUCT THE GIRL IN OTHER CIRCLES THE MATTER WAS STATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT IS TO SAY
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE STILL FURTHER INCREASED HIS CONFUSION THAT NOZDREV WAS A NOTORIOUS LIAR EVERY ONE OF COURSE KNEW AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN VENT TO AN IDIOTIC OUTBURST OF THIS SORT HAD SURPRISED NO ONE BUT A DEAD SOUL WELL
THERE LIVED THE LADY'S BOSOM FRIEND AS SOON AS THE BOSOM FRIEND IN QUESTION LEARNT OF THE NEWCOMER'S ARRIVAL SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE HALL AND THE TWO LADIES KISSED AND EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CUSTOMARILY EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN HIGH CLASS NOVELS WHICH HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY EXPERTS MORE QUALIFIED THAN I AM TO DESCRIBE SALONS AND ABLE TO BOAST OF SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOOD SOCIETY IN EFFECT
VARIOUS OTHER THEORIES WERE THEN PROPOUNDED AMONG THEM A THEORY THAT CHICHIKOV WAS NAPOLEON ESCAPED FROM SAINT HELENA AND TRAVELLING ABOUT THE WORLD IN DISGUISE AND IF IT SHOULD BE SUPPOSED THAT NO SUCH NOTION COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BROACHED LET THE READER
IN DISGUISE OR A SPY YESTERDAY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR EVEN DIED OF IT AND IS TO BE BURIED TO MORROW THIS WAS TRUE IN SO FAR AS THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE OFFICIAL IN QUESTION HAD HAD A FATAL STROKE PROBABLY INDUCED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MEETING
AND ONE MAN EVEN BREAKING OFF A CONVERSATION AT THE MOST INTERESTING POINT NAMELY THE POINT THAT THE INFERIOR LAND COURT MUST BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING YES IN SPITE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INFERIOR LAND COURT
AS AGAINST THE FACT THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED HE HAD BEEN MADE TO DISCLOSE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING A STRANGE AN AMBIGUOUS PART OF COURSE WHEN HE REVIEWED THE CONTRETEMPS IN THE LIGHT OF PURE REASON
LIKEWISE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE THE SORT OF MEN TO WHOM IN THEIR MORE INTIMATE MOVEMENTS THEIR WIVES WOULD VERY NATURALLY ADDRESS SUCH NICKNAMES AS TOBY JUG MARMOT FATTY POT BELLY SMUTTY KIKI AND BUZZ BUZZ THEY WERE MEN ALSO OF GOOD HEART
INDEED NOT A FACE WAS THERE TO BE SEEN ON WHICH ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR AT ALL EVENTS THE REFLECTION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ECSTATIC DELIGHT WAS NOT PAINTED THE SAME EXPRESSION MAY BE DISCERNED ON THE FACES OF SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS WHEN
BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE THERE WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM NOT A MENDICANT BUT A LANDOWNER AND A LANDOWNER POSSESSED OF FULLY A THOUSAND SERFS THE SUPERIOR OF ALL HIS NEIGHBOURS IN WEALTH OF FLOUR AND GRAIN
MARS LIKE MILITARY EXPRESSION A THING WHICH AS WE KNOW NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE THE FEMININE EYE CERTAIN OF THE LADIES EVEN TOOK TO BICKERING OVER HIM AND ON PERCEIVING THAT HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
WILL AMOUNT TO TWENTY FOUR ROUBLES NINETY SIX KOPECKS
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE FUNCTION IN LIFE OF ITS MEMBERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT OF MANAGING AND ADMINISTERING A HOUSEHOLD WITH THE LADIES THEREFORE MATTERS SOON ASSUMED VIVID AND DEFINITE SHAPE THEY BECAME CLEARLY
BUT ON AT LEAST ONE POINT ALL SEEMED TO AGREE NAMELY THAT CHICHIKOV'S APPEARANCE AND CONVERSATION WERE TOO RESPECTABLE FOR HIM TO BE A FORGER OR A DISGUISED BRIGAND THAT IS TO SAY ALL SEEMED TO AGREE ON THE POINT
UPON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOULS IN ALL AND CHICHIKOV'S SURPRISE AND ELATION WERE SUCH THAT THIS SAID HE REMAINED SITTING OPEN MOUTHED YES GOOD SIR REPLIED PLUSHKIN I AM TOO OLD TO TELL YOU LIES
HE TOOK A SEAT AND QUIETLY AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE NOTARY NOIRTIER SAW HIM SEAT HIMSELF WITH AN APPEARANCE OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AT THE SAME TIME GIVING A SIDE LOOK AT VALENTINE
DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
THERE RESIDES A VERY RICH GENTLEMAN AT WHOSE HOUSE YOU ROBBED AND MURDERED DID YOU NOT I BELIEVE I DID THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO TIS YOU WHO HAVE NAMED HIM
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID ALBERT ENTERING NO CARRIAGE TO BE HAD JUST SO RETURNED FRANZ YOU HAVE GUESSED IT WELL YOUR ETERNAL CITY IS A NICE SORT OF PLACE
ON PERCEIVING THE COUNT HE ROSE QUICKLY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO I BELIEVE SAID HE YES SIR AND I THINK I HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN ACCOMPANYING HIS WORDS WITH A BOW
AND AS THEY APPROACHED THEIR FACES BECAME VISIBLE PEPPINO WAS A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY BRONZED BY THE SUN HE CARRIED HIS HEAD ERECT AND SEEMED ON THE WATCH TO SEE ON WHICH SIDE HIS LIBERATOR WOULD APPEAR
HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW RENEE FOR HE FANCIED SHE WAS AGAIN ABOUT TO PLEAD FOR DANTES
NO NOT PRECISELY HOWEVER I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE A RENDEZVOUS DIAVOLO SAID THE DUKE THIS IS A BAD DAY OR RATHER A BAD NIGHT TO BE OUT LATE IS IT NOT COUNTESS THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO THE COUNTESS G
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE SAID MY MISTRESS SAID SHE SHOULD EXPECT YOU SIR AS SOON AS YOU HAD FINISHED DRESSING I AM GOING TO HER AND VILLEFORT WITH HIS PAPERS UNDER HIS ARM AND HAT IN HAND
GOOD GENDARMES I AM AT YOUR SERVICE AH SIR DO LEAVE A FEW CROWNS FOR ME AT THE GATE THAT I MAY HAVE SOME THINGS I AM IN NEED OF IT SHALL BE DONE
ALBERT KISSED HIS MOTHER'S HAND AND DREW NEAR THE COUNT ANOTHER SALVER PASSED LOADED LIKE THE PRECEDING ONES SHE SAW ALBERT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE THE COUNT BUT HE OBSTINATELY REFUSED ALBERT REJOINED HIS MOTHER SHE WAS VERY PALE WELL SAID SHE
I NEVER JOKE WITH BANKERS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN A FREEZING MANNER WHICH REPELLED IMPERTINENCE
HOPING TO TAKE HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE NO MONSIEUR RETURNED THE COUNT
WELL IT IS ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS AND A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE HE IS A VERY RICH ENGLISHMAN ECCENTRIC ALMOST TO INSANITY AND HIS REAL NAME IS LORD WILMORE AH INDEED THEN THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID ANDREA
BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
WHILE THE BANKER WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM THE DOOR OPENED AND A MAN DRESSED AS AN ABBE AND DOUBTLESS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE THAN HE WAS CAME IN AND INSTEAD OF WAITING MERELY BOWED PASSED ON TO THE FARTHER APARTMENTS
AND LISTENED TO THE DASH OF THE WAVES ON THE BEACH THAT LEFT AGAINST THE ROCKS A LACE OF FOAM AS WHITE AS SILVER HE WAS FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT REFLECTION OR THOUGHT FOR THE DIVINE CHARM WHICH IS IN THE THINGS OF NATURE
TO PUT THEIR HORSES IN A GALLOP IN ORDER TO SEE THE RICH FOREIGNER WHO COULD AFFORD TO GIVE TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS APIECE FOR HIS HORSES THE HOUSE ALI HAD CHOSEN AND WHICH WAS TO SERVE AS A TOWN RESIDENCE TO MONTE CRISTO
BUT I SHALL CONTENT MYSELF WITH ACCEPTING A PLACE IN YOUR CARRIAGE AND AT YOUR WINDOW AT THE ROSPOLI PALACE AND I LEAVE YOU AT LIBERTY TO DISPOSE OF MY PLACE AT THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO BUT I WARN YOU YOU WILL LOSE A VERY CURIOUS SIGHT RETURNED THE COUNT
WHO TAKING THEM FROM HIM RESTED HIS POLISHED BOOT LIGHTLY ON THE STEP AT THAT MOMENT A HAND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER THE YOUNG MAN TURNED ROUND
THAT FELLOW HAS A DECIDEDLY BAD COUNTENANCE SAID THE COUNT IN A TONE OF DISGUST AS HE SHUT UP HIS GLASS INTO ITS IVORY CASE HOW COMES IT THAT ALL DO NOT RETREAT IN AVERSION AT SIGHT OF THAT FLAT RECEDING
THEIR RETURN WAS QUITE AN EVENT BUT AS THEY ENTERED TOGETHER ALL UNEASINESS ON ALBERT'S ACCOUNT CEASED INSTANTLY
WITH THE PURPOSE OF OVERWHELMING HIM AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH LUXURY HE FOUND THE COUNT STANDING BEFORE SOME COPIES OF ALBANO AND FATTORE THAT HAD BEEN PASSED OFF TO THE BANKER AS ORIGINALS BUT WHICH MERE COPIES AS THEY WERE
IF YOUR SISTER LISTENED TO SUCH A PROPOSITION MADEMOISELLE
WHY SO IN LIFE OUR GREATEST PREOCCUPATION IS DEATH IS IT NOT THEN CURIOUS TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT WAYS BY WHICH THE SOUL AND BODY CAN PART AND HOW ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TEMPERAMENTS
HAVE YOU THE MONEY HE DEMANDS YES ALL BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES THE COUNT WENT TO HIS SECRETARY OPENED IT AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER FILLED WITH GOLD SAID TO FRANZ
ONLY DANGLARS CLOSETED IN HIS STUDY AND MAKING HIS STATEMENT TO THE OFFICER OF GENDARMES MADAME DANGLARS TERRIFIED IN THE BOUDOIR WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED AND EUGENIE
ALTHOUGH IN REALITY A LIBERAL
ARE YOU COMING MORREL DIRECTLY
BUT THAT CANNOT APPLY TO THE TIME PREVIOUS TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE VALENTINE
DANGLARS RESEMBLED A TIMID ANIMAL EXCITED IN THE CHASE FIRST IT FLIES THEN DESPAIRS AND AT LAST BY THE VERY FORCE OF DESPERATION SOMETIMES SUCCEEDS IN ELUDING ITS PURSUERS
I WOULD OFFER MYSELF AS YOUR SURETY AND FRIENDLY ADVISER SAID MONTE CRISTO DID I NOT POSSESS A MORAL DISTRUST OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND A SORT OF INCLINATION TO LEAD OTHERS TO DOUBT THEM TOO THEREFORE IN DEPARTING FROM THIS RULE I SHOULD AS THE ACTORS SAY
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
SHE IS A SLAVE WHOM I BOUGHT AT CONSTANTINOPLE MADAME THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE I HAVE ADOPTED HER AS MY DAUGHTER HAVING NO ONE ELSE TO LOVE IN THE WORLD YOU LIVE ALONE THEN I DO YOU HAVE NO SISTER NO SON
SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
NO REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS I AM TOO ILL
AND YOU HAVE CHOSEN THIS HONEST CITIZEN FOR YOUR STEWARD SAID DEBRAY OF HOW MUCH DOES HE ROB YOU EVERY YEAR ON MY WORD REPLIED THE COUNT NOT MORE THAN ANOTHER I AM SURE HE ANSWERS MY PURPOSE KNOWS NO IMPOSSIBILITY
HEARD THE SUCCESSIVE NOISES WHICH ACCOMPANY THE LIFE OF A HOUSE THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF DOORS
DANTES DID NOT COMPREHEND THE JEST BUT HIS HAIR STOOD ERECT ON HIS HEAD WELL HERE WE ARE AT LAST SAID ONE OF THEM A LITTLE FARTHER A LITTLE FARTHER SAID THE OTHER YOU KNOW VERY WELL
EMMANUEL HERBAUT MONTE CRISTO SMILED IMPERCEPTIBLY I LIVE THERE DURING MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN AND I SHALL BE TOGETHER WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW EMMANUEL AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE COUNT WHENEVER HE THINKS FIT TO HONOR US
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE OCCASION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS SIMILAR THE COMPANY WAS STRIKINGLY DISSIMILAR INSTEAD OF A RUDE MIXTURE OF SAILORS SOLDIERS AND THOSE BELONGING TO THE HUMBLEST GRADE OF LIFE
AND HAS TAKEN HER ARM SEE THEY ARE FOLLOWING US BOTH IN WHITE DRESSES ONE WITH A BOUQUET OF CAMELLIAS THE OTHER WITH ONE OF MYOSOTIS BUT TELL ME
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
SHE SAW THAT HE TOOK NOTHING AND EVEN NOTICED HIS GESTURE OF REFUSAL ALBERT SHE ASKED DID YOU NOTICE THAT WHAT MOTHER THAT THE COUNT HAS NEVER BEEN WILLING TO PARTAKE OF FOOD
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ONE CANNOT EXCEPT THROUGH COWARDICE I OFFER YOU THAT REFUGE REFUSE TO ADMIT CERTAIN PERSONS AT LEAST WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND THEN WITH ME SIR
AND SHE HAD RECOVERED DURING THE SCENE OF TUMULT ANDREA HAD TURNED HIS SMILING FACE TOWARDS THE ASSEMBLY THEN LEANING WITH ONE HAND ON THE OAKEN RAIL OF THE DOCK IN THE MOST GRACEFUL ATTITUDE POSSIBLE HE SAID GENTLEMEN I ASSURE YOU I HAD NO IDEA OF INSULTING THE COURT
REPLIED HE COLDLY AND YET HERE ARE TWO CULPRITS YES BUT ONLY ONE OF THESE TWO IS ABOUT TO DIE THE OTHER HAS MANY YEARS TO LIVE IF THE PARDON IS TO COME THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
WHAT YOU ASK IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT IF YOU ARE VERY WELL BEHAVED YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT AND SOME DAY YOU WILL MEET THE GOVERNOR AND IF HE CHOOSES TO REPLY THAT IS HIS AFFAIR
WHO WAS THE INVISIBLE CHIEF WHAT COULD BE HIS INTENTIONS TOWARDS HIM AND WHY WHEN EVERY ONE ELSE WAS ALLOWED TO BE RANSOMED MIGHT HE NOT ALSO BE
THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
DANTES YOUR HEALTH AND HE SWALLOWED ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE DANGLARS SAW IN THE MUDDLED LOOK OF THE TAILOR THE PROGRESS OF HIS INTOXICATION AND TURNING TOWARDS FERNAND SAID WELL YOU UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO NEED TO KILL HIM CERTAINLY NOT
BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE HISTORY WHICH THE INSPECTOR HAD RELATED INTERESTED HIM GREATLY FOR AFTER HAVING PERUSED THE FIRST DOCUMENTS HE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES UNTIL HE REACHED THE DEPOSITION RESPECTING EDMOND DANTES THERE HE FOUND EVERYTHING ARRANGED IN DUE ORDER
AS FOR ME YOU MUST KNOW I CANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE OUT OF LUCCA THEREFORE I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS I CAN BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FRANCE MY DEAR FATHER I HOPE YOU WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVE MY DESCENT
SPRINGING LIGHTLY UP THE THREE STEPS OF THE PORTICO AND THE NOTARY HE IS IN THE SMALL SALON EXCELLENCY RETURNED BERTUCCIO AND THE CARDS I ORDERED TO BE ENGRAVED AS SOON AS YOU KNEW THE NUMBER OF THE HOUSE
ALBERT TURNED SIR SAID HE TO DANGLARS
SHE MADE NO REMARK IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE PORTER RETURNED WITH A POST BOY AND HORSES WHICH WERE HARNESSED AND PUT IN THE POST CHAISE IN A MINUTE
THE YOUNG MAN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE MAJOR WHO HAD RISEN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING HIM AH MY DEAR FATHER SAID ANDREA IN A LOUD VOICE IN ORDER THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HEAR HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM IS IT REALLY YOU
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
AT THE SAME TIME AS THOUGH TO DISPROVE THE OGREISH PROPENSITIES THE MAN TOOK SOME BLACK BREAD CHEESE AND ONIONS FROM HIS WALLET WHICH HE BEGAN DEVOURING VORACIOUSLY MAY I BE HANGED SAID DANGLARS GLANCING AT THE BANDIT'S DINNER THROUGH THE CREVICES OF THE DOOR
HAVE MANKIND TREATED ME AS A BROTHER HAVE THEY LOVED ME HAVE THEY SPARED ME HAS ANY ONE SHOWN THE MERCY TOWARDS ME THAT YOU NOW ASK AT MY HANDS NO MADAME THEY STRUCK ME ALWAYS STRUCK ME
IN WHICH MORREL BY THE DEPUTY PROCUREUR'S ADVICE EXAGGERATED WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS FOR NAPOLEON WAS THEN ON THE THRONE THE SERVICES DANTES HAD RENDERED TO THE IMPERIAL CAUSE
WE WI THE OLD MAN STOPPED HER AT THE LAST SYLLABLE VALENTINE THEN TOOK THE DICTIONARY AND THE NOTARY WATCHED HER WHILE SHE TURNED OVER THE PAGES SHE PASSED HER FINGER SLOWLY DOWN THE COLUMNS AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE WORD WILL
SO CAN I SAID THE ENGLISHMAN AND HE LAUGHED TOO BUT HE LAUGHED AS THE ENGLISH DO AT THE END OF HIS TEETH AND SO CONTINUED THE ENGLISHMAN WHO FIRST GAINED HIS COMPOSURE HE WAS DROWNED UNQUESTIONABLY
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
YES HAD I DIED YEARS AGO BUT NOW TO DIE WOULD BE INDEED TO GIVE WAY TO THE SARCASM OF DESTINY NO I WANT TO LIVE I SHALL STRUGGLE TO THE VERY LAST
TO SNATCH A LITTLE MORE REST THE CLOCK STRIKING EIGHT AWOKE HER
YOUR NAME AND SURNAME ANDREA AROSE EXCUSE ME MISTER PRESIDENT HE SAID IN A CLEAR VOICE BUT I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO ADOPT A COURSE OF QUESTIONS THROUGH WHICH I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU I HAVE AN IDEA
IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
YOU LIVE ALONE THEN I DO YOU HAVE NO SISTER NO SON NO FATHER I HAVE NO ONE HOW CAN YOU EXIST THUS WITHOUT ANY ONE TO ATTACH YOU TO LIFE IT IS NOT MY FAULT MADAME
BUT I DID NOTHING OF THE SORT I SUFFERED HIM AND HIS BAND TO DEPART
CHAPTER EIGHTY SEVEN THE CHALLENGE THEN CONTINUED BEAUCHAMP I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SILENCE AND THE DARKNESS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN
HE PERCEIVED THAT TWO WERE APPROACHING HIM THE DELAY HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY A VISIT FROM MADAME DANGLARS AND EUGENIE WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED BEYOND THE TIME AT WHICH VALENTINE WAS EXPECTED
SIR SAID BEAUCHAMP WHO HAD NOT YET SPOKEN YOU APPEAR TO ACCUSE THE COUNT WHO IS ABSENT FROM PARIS AT THIS MOMENT AND CANNOT JUSTIFY HIMSELF I ACCUSE NO ONE SIR SAID DANGLARS I RELATE AND I WILL REPEAT BEFORE THE COUNT WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU
AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN
HE KNEW THAT I SHOULD ARRIVE TO DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MADAME SAID VILLEFORT WITH A FIRMNESS OF EXPRESSION NOT ALTOGETHER FREE FROM HARSHNESS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
THAT THEY WISHED TO LEAVE NO ENTREATY NO PROPOSITION OF INCREASED WAGES COULD INDUCE THEM TO REMAIN TO EVERY ARGUMENT THEY REPLIED WE MUST GO FOR DEATH IS IN THIS HOUSE
GOODNIGHT AND BEFORE DANTES COULD OPEN HIS MOUTH BEFORE HE HAD NOTICED WHERE THE JAILER PLACED HIS BREAD OR THE WATER BEFORE HE HAD GLANCED TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE STRAW WAS THE JAILER DISAPPEARED TAKING WITH HIM THE LAMP AND CLOSING THE DOOR
IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
A DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHOSE NAMES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE GOLDEN BOOK AT FLORENCE OUR FAMILY ALTHOUGH STILL RICH FOR MY FATHER'S INCOME AMOUNTS TO HALF A MILLION HAS EXPERIENCED MANY MISFORTUNES AND I MYSELF WAS AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS
WHO HASTENED TOWARDS HIM HOLDING OUT
I SHOULD HAVE FLED FROM MY COUNTRY DEAR ALBERT SAID BEAUCHAMP BUT THIS SUDDEN AND FACTITIOUS JOY SOON FORSOOK THE YOUNG MAN AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY A STILL GREATER GRIEF WELL SAID BEAUCHAMP WHAT STILL OPPRESSES YOU MY FRIEND
YOU NOW KNOW QUITE ENOUGH TO ENABLE YOU TO CONVERSE WITH M NOIRTIER TRY NOIRTIER GAVE VALENTINE SUCH A LOOK OF TENDERNESS AND GRATITUDE THAT IT WAS COMPREHENDED EVEN BY THE NOTARY HIMSELF
FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES ARE NOT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SOME TROUBLE AND ESPECIALLY IN FRANCE WHERE IT SEEMS IT IS FORBIDDEN TO BEAT THE POSTILIONS MY DEAR COUNT REPLIED ALBERT
I AM IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY SENSES SIR HE SAID MY BODY ALONE SUFFERS AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE I ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF GUILTY OF ALL THE YOUNG MAN HAS BROUGHT AGAINST ME AND FROM THIS HOUR HOLD MYSELF UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE PROCUREUR WHO WILL SUCCEED ME
WHO WOULD RELEASE HIM THAT THEN HE WOULD HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND REMAINING
AS SOON AS I LEARNED I COULD IN ANY WAY ASSIST YOU I MOST EAGERLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF OFFERING MY SERVICES THE TWO YOUNG MEN BOWED FRANZ HAD AS YET FOUND NOTHING TO SAY HE HAD COME TO NO DETERMINATION
COME WHO IS MY FATHER I CAME TO TELL YOU AH CRIED BENEDETTO HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH JOY JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED
AND YET DANTES NEED NOT DIE DEATH ALONE CAN SEPARATE THEM REMARKED FERNAND YOU TALK LIKE A NOODLE MY FRIEND SAID CADEROUSSE AND HERE IS DANGLARS WHO IS A WIDE AWAKE CLEVER DEEP FELLOW WHO WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT YOU ARE WRONG
WHEN ONE THINKS SAID CADEROUSSE LETTING HIS HAND DROP ON THE PAPER
THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
DROPPING THE STOOL AND SITTING ON IT AS IF HE WERE IN REALITY MAD THE JAILER WENT OUT AND RETURNED IN AN INSTANT WITH A CORPORAL AND FOUR SOLDIERS BY THE GOVERNOR'S ORDERS SAID HE CONDUCT THE PRISONER TO THE TIER BENEATH TO THE DUNGEON THEN SAID THE CORPORAL
ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
OH I AM DONE WITH CONSIDERING I AM TIRED OF HEARING ONLY OF MARKET REPORTS OF THE END OF THE MONTH OF THE RISE AND FALL OF SPANISH FUNDS OF HAITIAN BONDS INSTEAD OF THAT LOUISE DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN WELL WELL DON'T BE ANGRY MY BOY YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT IS TO BE UNFORTUNATE AND MISFORTUNES MAKE US JEALOUS
A SUDDEN RESOLUTION SIR BUT NOT A SUDDEN IDEA IF SHE AGREES ALL IS WELL AND GOOD THE SEQUENCE IS OBVIOUS AND IT IS TO BE KEPT A SECRET AMONGST OURSELVES I WANT NO SECRET SIR EXCEPT FOR MIMI'S GOOD FOR MYSELF I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOUT IT FROM THE HOUSE TOPS
WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE CONFERENCE AT ONCE ASSUMED A PRACTICAL TREND SIR NATHANIEL RECOGNISED THIS AND LIKE AN OLD DIPLOMATIST TURNED IT TO PRESENT USE TELL ME NOW ADAM WHAT IS THE OUTCOME IN YOUR OWN MIND OF OUR CONVERSATION
IT WAS ONE THING WHEN FANCIED EVILS THREATENED BUT NOW HE IS PROBABLY MARKED FOR DEATH AND IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD KNOW ALL I AM WITH YOU SIR THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE WE AGREED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE TROUBLE NOW WE DARE NOT
TO AN AGE WHEN DRAGONS TORE EACH OTHER IN THEIR SLIME WE MUST FEAR NOTHING NO CONCLUSION HOWEVER IMPROBABLE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT MAY BE LIFE AND DEATH IS HANGING ON OUR JUDGMENT NOT ONLY FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR OTHERS WHOM WE LOVE
NOW ADAM IT STRIKES ME THAT AS WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OTHERS AGAINST FEMININE NATURE OUR STRONG GAME WILL BE TO PLAY OUR MASCULINE AGAINST HER FEMININE PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER SLEEP ON IT SHE IS A THING OF THE NIGHT
A DEVELOPING THING MAY EXPAND IN ANY GIVEN WAY OR FORM NOW IT IS A SCIENTIFIC LAW THAT INCREASE IMPLIES GAIN AND LOSS OF VARIOUS KINDS WHAT A THING GAINS IN ONE DIRECTION IT MAY LOSE IN ANOTHER
BUT LATER I PUZZLED MY BRAIN FOR A REASON AND WHAT WAS THE REASON SIR SIMPLY AND SOLELY BECAUSE THE SNAKE OR WORM WAS WHITE WE ARE NEAR THE COUNTY OF STAFFORD WHERE THE GREAT INDUSTRY OF CHINA BURNING WAS ORIGINATED AND GREW
THE POSTILLION PLIED WHIP AND SPUR AND THE VEHICLE ROCKING WITH ITS SPEED SWEPT THROUGH THE GATE AND TORE UP THE ROAD BEHIND THEM WAS A HUBBUB
MAY BE SOMEONE WHO WISHES TO MAKE A SETTLEMENT IN THE OLD COUNTRY AND WOULD CARE TO FIX THE SPOT IN ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC REGIONS IN ENGLAND FULL OF ROMANCE AND LEGEND AND WITH A NEVER ENDING VISTA OF HISTORICAL INTEREST AN ESTATE WHICH THOUGH SMALL
I HAVE IT IN MY BONES SIR THAT YOU HAVE STRUCK OR RATHER REASONED OUT A GREAT TRUTH SIR NATHANIEL WENT ON CHEERFULLY
HE PASSED ON A LITTLE LATER WHEN HIS STEPS TOOK HIM NATURALLY ENOUGH
THE FOOTMEN BEGAN TO EDGE UNEASILY TOWARDS THE INNER DOOR DENSER AND DENSER GREW THE SMOKE AND MORE ACRID ITS SMELL MIMI TOWARDS WHOM THE DRAUGHT FROM THE OPEN DOOR WAFTED THE SMOKE ROSE UP CHOKING AND RAN TO THE INNER DOOR WHICH SHE THREW OPEN TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT
AS TIME GOES ON AND THE NEEDS OF LIFE BECOME MORE COMPLEX POWER FOLLOWS NEED WE HAVE BEEN LONG ACCUSTOMED TO CONSIDER GROWTH AS APPLIED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO SIZE IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS BUT NATURE
AND HOW LILLA LOOKED AND WHAT MIMI SAID AND DID ALSO OOLANGA CASWALL'S WEST AFRICAN SERVANT I'LL DO WHAT I CAN SIR ALL THE TIME MISTER CASWALL WAS STARING HE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED AND MOTIONLESS
ACCORDINGLY ADAM GAVE HIM DETAILS OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE PREVIOUS EVENING
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO SAY THAT NEITHER ADAM NOR MIMI HAD ANY FEAR IN RETURNING TO DOOM TOWER MIMI FELT IT MORE KEENLY THAN HER HUSBAND WHOSE NERVES WERE HARDER AND WHO WAS MORE INURED TO DANGER STILL SHE BORE UP BRAVELY
WITH REGARD TO THE EXTERMINATION HE FOUND THAT THE SNAKES WERE EVEN MORE EASILY ATTACKED THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY NO LESS THAN SIX WERE KILLED IN THE FIRST HALF HOUR AS NO MORE APPEARED
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN ADAM WENT TO HIS HOST IN THE SMOKING ROOM SIR NATHANIEL ASKED HIM HOW HE PURPOSED TO PROCEED WITH REGARD TO KEEPING HIS VOW
THEN SEEING THAT NOTHING HAPPENED AND THAT THE LIGHT AND ALL OUTSIDE THE TOWER REMAINED THE SAME HE SOFTLY PULLED THE CURTAIN OVER THE WINDOW
THEREFORE THE ONLY REASON WHICH COULD ACTUATE HER WOULD BE TO CONVINCE SOMEONE ELSE THAT SHE WAS BLAMELESS THIS SOMEONE COULD NOT BE YOU FOR YOU HAD THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR OWN EYES THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE PRESENT THEREFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ABSENT PERSON
AND DRAG HIM DOWN WITH HER INTO THE HOLE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN SIR
WOULD REGARD HER IF SHE WERE TO TELL HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO A TEA PARTY WITH AN ANTEDILUVIAN MONSTER
JOY APPEARED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY AS A FACTOR OF LIFE AND THIS CREATIVE IMPULSE HAD NOTHING TO TAKE ITS PLACE
APART FROM THAT THERE ARE THE UNPLEASANT DETAILS WE DISCUSSED THE OTHER DAY COULD YOU WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME THE REASON NOW IT WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEFORE US IN THE WAY OF DIFFICULTY CERTAINLY SIR
MOREOVER I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING WHICH INDEED IS ONLY A SURMISE BUT WHICH IF I AM RIGHT WILL ADD GREAT VALUE TO THE PLACE ADAM LISTENED HAS IT EVER STRUCK YOU WHY THE OLD NAME THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM WAS GIVEN
WAS PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING ESPECIALLY AT THE POINTS LIABLE TO ATTACK FROM WHICH IT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO USE
SHE HAS COMMITTED CRIMES TO OUR KNOWLEDGE SHE RETAINS SOMETHING OF THE VAST STRENGTH OF HER PRIMAL BEING
GOD BLESS MY SOUL THIS IS A NEW KIND OF DUTY TO TAKE ON AT MY TIME OF LIFE ADAM I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN I HAVE ALREADY COUNTED ON YOU SIR WHEN I VENTURED TO MAKE SUCH A SUGGESTION
THERE ARE STRANGE THINGS IN FRONT OF US
MORE THAN EVER THE WEAKER LILLA SEEMED THE STRONGER HE BECAME JUST AS IF HE WERE FEEDING ON HER STRENGTH ALL AT ONCE SHE TURNED ROUND THREW UP HER HANDS AND FELL DOWN IN A FAINT I COULD NOT SEE WHAT ELSE HAPPENED JUST THEN
WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL SHAPE AND WHAT ARE THE ADDED DANGERS
WHO SOON DEVOURED THE FEW MILES OF THEIR JOURNEY BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE GATE SIR NATHANIEL TURNED TO MIMI I HAVE ARRANGED WITH ADAM CERTAIN SIGNALS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY IF CERTAIN EVENTUALITIES OCCUR THESE NEED BE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU DIRECTLY
ALWAYS BE WITH ME I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO SEE YOU ON MY RETURN OR EARLIER IF MY GOOD FORTUNE SENDS YOU ON ANY ERRAND TO LONDON
ALL AT ONCE MY OWN FACULTIES WERE FULLY RESTORED I COULD SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING AND BE FULLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON EVEN THE FIGURES OF THE BALEFUL GROUP WERE THERE THOUGH DIMLY SEEN AS THROUGH A VEIL A SHADOWY VEIL
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IT WAS SOLELY DUE TO THE SELF RESTRAINT WHICH YOU IMPRESSED ON ME THAT I DID NOT WIPE HIM OUT AS HE STOOD WITHOUT WARNING WITHOUT FAIR PLAY WITHOUT A SINGLE ONE OF THE GRACES OF LIFE AND DEATH
HE KNEW OOLANGA AND HAD MADE A STUDY OF HIM HE IS A MAN WHO GETS ON WELL WITH NIGGERS AND THEY OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO HIM IT SEEMS THAT THIS OOLANGA IS QUITE A GREAT PERSON IN THE NIGGER WORLD OF THE AFRICAN WEST COAST
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE SILENT FOR A TIME TO LILLA ON THE HAPPY EVENTS OF THAT STRANGE MISSION SHE HAD OF COURSE AGREED TO KEEP ALL SECRET UNTIL ADAM SHOULD GIVE HER LEAVE TO SPEAK
EVEN HUMAN BEINGS WERE AFFECTED BY IT AS IF BOTH IT AND THEY WERE REALITIES AS FOR THE PEOPLE AT MERCY FARM IT WAS LIKE A TASTE OF ACTUAL DEATH
AS TIME WENT ON HER FACE BECAME PINCHED AND HER EYES DULL WITH WATCHING AND CRYING MIMI SUFFERED TOO ON ACCOUNT OF HER COUSIN'S SUFFERING BUT AS SHE COULD DO NOTHING SHE RESOLUTELY MADE UP HER MIND TO SELF RESTRAINT AND PATIENCE
MY HANDS SHAKE SO THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDER CONTROL AND I AM TREMBLING ALL OVER WITH MEMORY OF THE HORRORS WE SAW ENACTED BEFORE OUR EYES I AM GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE THAT I SHOULD BE HOWEVER REMOTELY A CAUSE OF THIS HORROR COMING ON YOU
AND WE CAN LEAVE DETAILS TO BE THRASHED OUT BY OUR AGENTS FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU FOR TROUBLING YOU IN THE MATTER AND BELIEVE ME YOURS VERY SINCERELY ARABELLA MARCH ADAM READ THIS OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN HIS MIND BEING MADE UP
FOR A BEGINNING THEN LET ME SAY THAT LADY ARABELLA'S LETTER MAKES CLEAR SOME THINGS WHICH SHE INTENDED AND ALSO SOME THINGS WHICH SHE DID NOT INTEND BUT BEFORE I BEGIN TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ADAM
SHE STEPPED FORWARD TOWARDS CASWALL AND WITH A BOLD SWEEP OF HER ARM SEEMED TO DRIVE SOME STRANGE FORCE TOWARDS HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN WAS THE GESTURE REPEATED THE MAN FALLING BACK FROM HER AT EACH MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE DOOR HE RETREATED
BE QUITE FREE TO ACT AS YOU SEE YOUR DUTY AND AS YOUR INCLINATION CALLS WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND HE HAS HITHERTO GUIDED US AND WILL DO SO TO HIS OWN END FROM HIS WIFE'S ROOM ADAM SALTON WENT STRAIGHT TO THE STUDY IN THE TOWER
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY WITHOUT YOUR UNCLE KNOWING ABOUT IT OR EVEN WHAT THE SUBJECT IS
I DO NOT THINK I EVER SAW A GIRL WHO UNITED IN SUCH PERFECTION THE QUALITIES OF STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND SWEETNESS OF DISPOSITION WITH ALL MY HEART I CONGRATULATE YOU THEN I MAY TAKE IT THAT MY QUESTION AS TO YOUR HEART WHOLENESS IS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
THAT LIFE CAN GIVE I HAVE KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO LOVE AND TO LOSE BUT YOU MUST NOT LET ME BRING ANY UNHAPPINESS INTO YOUR LIFE I MUST LIVE ON AS I HAVE LIVED ALONE AND IN ADDITION
WHERE HE KNEW SIR NATHANIEL WOULD BE AT THAT HOUR THE OLD MAN WAS ALONE SO WHEN HE HAD ENTERED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COME IN WHICH ANSWERED HIS QUERY HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM DO YOU THINK SIR
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR A STARTLING PROPOSITION THE MORE MIMI THOUGHT OVER THE LATE EVENTS THE MORE PUZZLED SHE WAS WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN WHAT COULD IT MEAN EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS AN ERROR OF FACT SOMEWHERE
HE WAS ORIGINALLY A WITCH FINDER ABOUT AS LOW AN OCCUPATION AS EXISTS AMONGST ABORIGINAL SAVAGES THEN HE GOT UP IN THE WORLD AND BECAME AN OBI MAN WHICH GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEALTH VIA BLACKMAIL
IT SEEMED LIKE A NEW MISANTHROPIC BELIEF WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HUMAN BEINGS CARRYING WITH IT THE NEGATION OF ALL HOPE AFTER A FEW DAYS MEN BEGAN TO GROW DESPERATE THEIR VERY WORDS AS WELL AS THEIR SENSES SEEMED TO BE IN CHAINS
FROM CASTRA REGIS BUT THERE FOLLOWED IN TURN
HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO HIM THEN OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ARRANGING THAT THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER IN THE EARLY MORNING AS HE HAD MUCH TO SAY THAT WOULD REQUIRE SERIOUS ATTENTION
KNEW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT THEY MADE A VAST KITE WHICH THEY CAUSED TO BE FLOWN OVER THE CENTRE SPOT OF THE INCURSION THE KITE WAS SHAPED LIKE A GREAT HAWK AND THE MOMENT IT ROSE INTO THE AIR THE BIRDS BEGAN TO COWER AND SEEK PROTECTION
WHEN ADAM GOT BACK TO LESSER HILL HE WENT TO THE COACH HOUSE WHERE THE BOX WITH THE MONGOOSE WAS KEPT AND TOOK IT WITH HIM INTENDING TO FINISH AT THE MOUND OF STONE WHAT HE HAD BEGUN THE PREVIOUS MORNING
ALL SHALL BE AS YOU WISH ADAM AND NOW AS TO WHAT WE ARE TO DO WE CANNOT MURDER LADY ARABELLA OFF HAND THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT THINGS IN ORDER FOR THE KILLING AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE CANNOT BE TAXED WITH A CRIME
I SHALL SEE HIM FOR EVER IN MY DREAMS HIS BLACK MALIGNANT FACE WILL SHUT OUT ALL MEMORY OF SUNSHINE AND HAPPINESS I SHALL ETERNALLY SEE HIS EVIL EYES AS HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THAT WELL HOLE IN A VAIN EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN MISDOING
YOU AND I THEREFORE WHO BOTH LOVE HIM THOUGH IN DIFFERENT WAYS SHOULD MAKE IT OUR BUSINESS TO PROTECT HIM FROM ALL DISTURBING INFLUENCES I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT ANY LABOUR TO THIS END WOULD BE WELL SPENT
THE RECOLLECTION OF MANY HAPPY DAYS OF MY YOUNG MARRIED LIFE AND THE MORE THAN HAPPY MEMORIES OF THE MAN I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME SO MUCH I SHOULD BE WILLING TO SELL THE PLACE FOR ANY FAIR PRICE SO LONG OF COURSE
WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A SNAKE WHICH IN EARLY DAYS WAS CALLED A WORM BUT WHY WHITE I REALLY DON'T KNOW SIR I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT I SIMPLY TOOK IT FOR GRANTED SO DID I AT FIRST LONG AGO
IT WILL DOUBTLESS BE SOME ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE BUT NONE THE LESS DANGEROUS ON THAT ACCOUNT HERE WE ARE AT THE GATE NOW BE CAREFUL IN ALL MATTERS HOWEVER SMALL TO KEEP YOUR HEAD IS HALF THE BATTLE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MEN IN LIVERY IN THE HALL WHEN THEY ARRIVED
TAKE FOR INSTANCE MONSTERS THAT TRADITION HAS ACCEPTED AND LOCALISED SUCH AS THE WORM OF LAMBTON
THE WHITE WORM WILL NOT TRY FORCE THOUGH SHE HAS SO MUCH OF IT TO SPARE WHATEVER SHE MAY ATTEMPT TO DAY OF HARM TO ANY OF US WILL BE IN THE WAY OF SECRET PLOT SOME OTHER TIME SHE MAY TRY FORCE BUT IF I AM ABLE TO JUDGE SUCH A THING
REMEMBER I COUNT ON YOU AS I HOPE YOU COUNT ON ME I DO WITH ALL CONFIDENCE THEN SAID SIR NATHANIEL LET US THINK JUSTLY AND BOLDLY AND FEAR NOTHING HOWEVER TERRIFYING IT MAY SEEM
BUT BEYOND SUCH MATTERS SHE DID NOT TRY TO GO THE ONLY COMMENT SHE MADE WAS OF STRONGLY EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT HER LADYSHIP'S CHEEK IN IGNORING HER OWN CRIMINAL ACTS AND HER IMPUDENCE IN TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT OTHERS HAD OVERLOOKED THEM ALSO
SIR NATHANIEL THEN PERSUADED OLD MISTER SALTON TO ALLOW HIS NEPHEW TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HIM AT DOOM TOWER AND IT WAS HERE THAT MIMI BECAME ADAM'S WIFE BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN THEIR PLANS BEFORE GOING FURTHER HOWEVER ADAM TOOK HIS BRIDE OFF TO THE ISLE OF MAN
WE MAY BE SURE THAT IN THE FIGHT THAT IS BEFORE US THERE WILL BE NO SEMBLANCE OF FAIR PLAY ALSO THAT OUR UNSCRUPULOUS OPPONENT WILL NOT BETRAY HERSELF THAT IS SO BUT BEING FEMININE SHE WILL PROBABLY OVER REACH HERSELF
IS GOING TO BE UTILISED WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS SIR NATHANIEL'S VOICE WAS FULL OF SERIOUSNESS AND IT BROUGHT TO MIMI IN A CONVINCING WAY THE AWFUL GRAVITY OF THE OCCASION IN DUE COURSE THEY SET OUT IN A CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A FINE PAIR OF HORSES
ALL SUCH DIFFICULTIES SHOULD BE MUST BE AVOIDED FOR MISTER SALTON'S SAKE FOR ADAM'S OWN SAKE AND MOST OF ALL FOR MIMI WATFORD'S SAKE BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN SIR NATHANIEL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE MUST TRY TO POSTPONE DECISIVE ACTION UNTIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH THEY DEPENDED
YOU ALSO OBSERVED THAT MIMI WAS DISTURBED IN HER MIND AT THE WAY MISTER CASWALL LOOKED AT HER COUSIN CERTAINLY THOUGH DISTURBED IS A POOR WAY OF EXPRESSING HER OBJECTION CAN YOU REMEMBER WELL ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE CASWALL'S EYES
THE SOUNDLESS AIR SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE UNIVERSAL DARKNESS WHEN MEN GNAWED THEIR TONGUES WITH PAIN FROM THIS INFLICTION OF SILENCE THERE WAS NO RELIEF EVERYTHING WAS AFFECTED GLOOM WAS THE PREDOMINANT NOTE
THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL CRUXES TO BE THOUGHT OUT NOT ONLY REGARDING THE TAKING OF LIFE EVEN OF A MONSTROSITY IN HUMAN FORM BUT ALSO OF PROPERTY LADY ARABELLA BE SHE WOMAN OR SNAKE OR DEVIL
FOR MIMI HAD THROWN HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER AND HID HER FROM ME THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A BLACK SHADOW BETWEEN US AND THERE WAS THE NIGGER LOOKING MORE LIKE A MALIGNANT DEVIL THAN EVER I AM NOT USUALLY A PATIENT MAN
AFTER ALL THE MEDIAEVAL BELIEF IN THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE WHICH COULD TRANSMUTE METALS HAS ITS COUNTERPART IN THE ACCEPTED THEORY OF METABOLISM WHICH CHANGES LIVING TISSUE IN AN AGE OF INVESTIGATION LIKE OUR OWN WHEN WE ARE RETURNING TO SCIENCE AS THE BASE OF WONDERS
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THEM ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO WHITE WORM AT ALL ON EITHER SIDE OF HER WAS A BELIEF IMPOSSIBLE OF RECEPTION NOT TO BELIEVE IN WHAT SEEMED APPARENT WAS TO DESTROY THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF BELIEF
BUT THE FRICTION OF SUCH A BODY WORKING UP AGAINST IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUS ONE MOMENT WHAT USE WOULD THE SAND BE FOR DESTRUCTION NONE DIRECTLY BUT IT WOULD HOLD THE STRUGGLING BODY IN PLACE TILL THE REST OF MY SCHEME CAME INTO PRACTICE AND WHAT IS THE REST
TORTURED HIS BRAIN FOR A LONG TIME UNAVAILINGLY TO THINK OF SOME MEANS OF GETTING RID OF WHAT HE AS WELL AS HIS NEIGHBOURS HAD COME TO REGARD AS A PLAGUE OF BIRDS AT LAST HE RECALLED A CIRCUMSTANCE
A FILLIP WAS GIVEN TO THE CONVERSATION WHEN ADAM TOLD OF HIS SEEING LADY ARABELLA ON HER WAY TO CASTRA REGIS THEY EACH HAD SOMETHING TO SAY OF HER AND OF WHAT HER WISHES OR INTENTIONS WERE TOWARDS EDGAR CASWALL
HIS WEIGHT TOLD AND HE DRAGGED HER UP FROM THE HOLE AND THEY FELL TOGETHER ON THE FLOOR OUTSIDE THE ZONE OF SLIPPERINESS IN A MOMENT HE HAD RAISED HER UP AND TOGETHER THEY RUSHED OUT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR INTO THE SUNLIGHT SIR NATHANIEL CLOSE BEHIND THEM
THIS ONE IS A WOMAN WITH ALL A WOMAN'S WIT COMBINED WITH THE HEARTLESSNESS OF A COCOTTE
MIMI SPOKE BITTERLY OF HER IN EVERY ASPECT SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN AND NEVER WOULD NEVER COULD THE OCCASION WHEN TO HARM LILLA THE WOMAN HAD CONSORTED EVEN WITH THE NIGGER
SO AS TO BE READY TO ENTER ON THE MATTER WITH SIR NATHANIEL HE WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS TO TELLING HIS UNCLE FOR AFFAIRS HAD SO VASTLY PROGRESSED BEYOND HIS ORIGINAL VIEW THAT HE FELT A LITTLE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S ATTITUDE WHEN HE SHOULD HEAR OF THE STRANGE EVENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE ASKS MIMI AND ME TO TEA THIS AFTERNOON AT DIANA'S GROVE AND HOPES THAT YOU ALSO WILL FAVOUR HER SIR NATHANIEL SMILED PLEASE ASK MISSUS SALTON TO ACCEPT FOR US ALL SHE MEANS SOME DEADLY MISCHIEF SURELY SURELY IT WOULD BE WISER NOT
ACCORDINGLY ADAM PROCEEDED WHEN I TOLD YOU THE CONCLUSIONS AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED I PUT IN THE FOREGROUND THAT MIMI WATFORD SHOULD FOR THE SAKE OF HER OWN SAFETY
AND ONLY THE SUPPORTING WALLS AND PILLARS HAD BEEN LEFT INTACT THE WHOLE OF THE ROCKS WERE SHATTERED SIR NATHANIEL NODDED APPROVAL
THE MORE I THINK OF IT THE MORE APPARENT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAD PREMEDITATED THE WHOLE THING OF COURSE EXCEPT HIS OWN HORRIBLE DEATH PERHAPS YOU HAVE NOTICED A FUR COLLAR I OCCASIONALLY WEAR IT IS ONE OF MY MOST VALUED TREASURES
IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES PUBLICITY IS A PART OF SAFETY DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF WHILST WE ARE AT DIANA'S GROVE OCCASIONAL MESSAGES COME FOR YOU FOR ALL OR ANY OF US I SEE SAID MISSUS SALTON YOU ARE TAKING NO CHANCES NONE MY DEAR
WOULD THE YOUNG LADY BE AGREEABLE TO THAT PROCEEDING I DO NOT KNOW SIR THEN HOW ARE WE TO PROCEED I SUPPOSE THAT WE OR ONE OF US MUST ASK HER IS THIS A SUDDEN IDEA ADAM A SUDDEN RESOLUTION
BUT THERE WAS MANY A TIME MY FINGERS ITCHED TO BE AT HIM AND I COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM KNOCKING SOME OF THE SULKINESS OUT OF HIM THIS DAY SOMEHOW I WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF TEMPERS MYSELF I HAD A GOOD LOT ON MY MIND
AND GOT A RECEIPT FOR IT THAT'S JUST LIKE YER SAYS FATHER
A GOOD LOOK AND IF I'D BEEN A FELLOW THAT PAINTED PICTURES AND THAT KIND OF THING I COULD DRAW A MIDDLIN GOOD LIKENESS OF HIM NOW BY GEORGE HOW FOND I AM OF A GOOD HORSE A REAL WELL BRED CLINKER
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE LIVED WITH US SINCE WE CAME HERE AND THAT NO FELLOW COULD HAVE BEHAVED MORE TRULY LIKE A MAN AND A GENTLEMAN
WAS ONE OF THOSE SHILLING FLASKS OF BRANDY THEY SELL FOR CHAPS TO GO ON THE ROAD WITH BRANDY AIN'T A GOOD THING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS AND I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONE MAN OR A DOZEN EITHER THAT MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE SAWED AWAY AT THEIR THROATS WITH A BLUNT KNIFE AS PUT THE FIRST GLASS TO THEIR LIPS
I DIDN'T SEE EM BUT I CUT THEIR TRACKS FIVE SHOD HORSES THEY MIGHT BE HERE TO MORROW
HE WAS OUT ON HIS OWN HOOK AND IT'S MY BELIEF HE'LL BE TOOK THIS TIME IF HE ISN'T VERY CAREFUL
HE WASN'T ABOVE FIFTEEN HANDS AND AN INCH HIGH BUT LOOKED A DEAL BIGGER THAN HE WAS FOR THE WAY HE HELD HIS HEAD UP AND CARRIED HIMSELF HE WAS DEEP AND THICK THROUGH BEHIND THE SHOULDERS AND GIRTHED EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU'D THINK
YOUR INTIMATE FRIEND AND PARTNER FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS YOU PERFECTLY AMAZE ME SAYS CLIFFORD BUT CAN'T YOU BE MISTAKEN IS YOUR INFORMATION TO BE DEPENDED UPON MINE CAME FROM A JEALOUS WOMAN SAYS SIR FERDINAND THEY MAY GENERALLY BE DEPENDED UPON FOR A STRAIGHT TIP
AND IF A MAN'S AT ALL INCLINED TO BE CRANKY IT'LL COME OUT THEN
I BELIEVE STARLIGHT'S HURT SOMEHOW HE'S SO INFERNAL RASH I CAN SEE THE HALF CASTE HOLDING HIM ON IF THE POLICE ARE ON HIS TRACKS THEY'LL SPRING THE PLANT HERE AND THE WHOLE THING'LL BE BLOWN WE SAW THEM COME TO THE TOP OF THE WALL AS IT WERE
WORKED AN ADJOINING CLAIM TO THE ARIZONA SLUICING COMPANY WITH THE RESPECTED SHAREHOLDERS OF WHICH THEY WERE ON TERMS OF INTIMACY THE WELL KNOWN STARLIGHT AS MISTER FRANK HAUGHTON
I NEVER FORGET THE WAY TO A FRIEND'S PLACE GEORGE SHE SAID
I'VE FOUND IT OUT SINCE WORSE LUCK AND I REALLY BELIEVE IF GEORGE HAD HAD THE SAVEY TO CRACK HIMSELF UP A LITTLE AND SAY HE'D MET A NICE GIRL OR TWO IN THE BACK COUNTRY AND HID HIS HAND
GOOD AS ANYTHING ENGLAND COULD TURN OUT I SAY AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HORSE FLESH PART OF IT THE FUN AND HARD RIDING AND TRACKING AND ALL THE REST OF IT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING LIKE THE CROSS WORK THAT THERE IS IN AUSTRALIA IT LIES PARTLY BETWEEN THAT AND THE DRY WEATHER
I SOMETIMES WONDER AILEEN SAYS AT LAST RAISING UP HER HEAD IF I HAD BEEN A MAN WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THINGS YOU AND JIM HAVE OR WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE LIVED HONESTLY AND WORKED STEADILY LIKE GEORGE OVER THERE
I WOULDN'T CHANCE HER SHE'S KNOWN TO A LOT OF JOCKEY BOYS AND HANGERS ON
WHERE HE'D COME FROM OF COURSE WE WERE NOT TO KNOW THEN HE HAD A SMALL PRIVATE SORT OF BRAND THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO ANY OF THE BIG STUDS BUT HE WAS NEVER BRED BY A POOR MAN
WE WERE REGULARLY BOXED UP WITH THE DIGGERS NOBODY KNEW WHO WE WERE OR WHERE WE CAME FROM AND ONLY FOR THIS JEZEBEL NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF WE'D COME HERE THEY'D HAVE ALL DROPPED THAT WE WERE OLD FRIENDS
THE REST HE WAS TO KEEP FOR HIS SHARE FOR TROUBLE AND RISK THERE WAS SOME RISK NO DOUBT IN DEALING WITH US BUT ALL THE GOLD THAT WAS BOUGHT IN THEM DAYS WASN'T SQUARE NOT BY A LOT BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF SWEARING TO IT
ONLY I COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE HAD THAT SET LOOK HE ONLY GOT NOW AND THEN AND HIS EYES BEGAN TO SHOW OUT A FIERCE LIGHT AT LAST WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT THE RETURN FIRE WAS SLACKING OFF WHILE OURS WAS AS BRISK AS EVER
THE HORSE HELD UP HIS HEAD AND SNORTED AS HE CAME ABREAST OF US AND WE SHOWED OUT HE WAS ONE OF THE GRANDEST ANIMALS I'D EVER SEEN AND I AFTERWARDS FOUND HE WAS BETTER THAN HE LOOKED
BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED THE LEGALISED ROBBERY OF THE BETTING RING HAS NOT LEVIED CONTRIBUTIONS RATHER THE OTHER WAY INDEED
AND THERE WE'LL BE SAFE ANYHOW THEY CAN'T TOUCH JEANIE YOU KNOW AND YOU'RE NOT SHORT OF WHAT CASH SHE'LL WANT TO KEEP HER TILL THIS BLOWS OVER A BIT AND WHAT AM I TO DO ALL THE TIME HE SAYS SO PITIFUL LIKE
AND THEY'LL RUN US DOWN TOO THEY CAN'T BE OFF IT WHATEVER MADE EM THINK OF SUCH A BIG TOUCH AS THAT THAT STARLIGHT'S THE DEVIL I THINK SAID JIM SLOWLY FATHER DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT AT FIRST
WHILE REJOICING AS MUST ALL GOOD CITIZENS AT THE DISCOVERY OF EVIL DOERS AND THE CAPTURE OF ONE MEMBER OF A BAND OF NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS WE MUST STATE IN FAIRNESS AND CANDOUR THAT THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN WHILE ON THE FIELD AS MINERS FREE FROM REPROACH IN EVERY WAY
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THEY'D MAKE YOU A BEAK IF YOU'D STAYED THERE LONG ENOUGH I'M AFRAID DICK'S DROPPING THE POLICEMAN WON'T ADD TO OUR POPULARITY THOUGH HE'S ALL RIGHT I SAID HURRAH LOOK HERE I'M GLAD I DIDN'T FINISH THE POOR BEGGAR LISTEN TO THIS FROM THE TURON BANNER
AILEEN WOULD HAVE MADE IT UP WITH HIM THAT VERY CHRISTMAS AND BEEN A HAPPY WOMAN ALL HER LIFE
MY HEAD'S A FIRE AND THESE CURSED RIBS ARE GRINDING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER EVERY STEP OF THIS INFERNAL LADDER IS IT FAR NOW HOW HE GROANED THEN
EVERY ONE WAS GOING TO CUT AWAY AND LEAVE HIM HE'D BE ALL BY HIMSELF WITH NO ONE BUT THE DOG FOR COMPANY AND BE AS MISERABLE AS A BANDICOOT BUT NO ONE CARED A BLANK BRASS FARDEN ABOUT THAT COME WITH US GOVERNOR SAYS STARLIGHT
ALWAYS DID AND ALWAYS WILL AS FOR THE HORSE A BARGAIN A BARGAIN AND A DASHED BAD BARGAIN TOO WHY DIDN'T YE TURN PARSON INSTEAD OF TAKING TO THE BUSH SAYS FATHER WITH A GRIN
GEORGE SHOOK HANDS WITH AILEEN AND TURNED BACK WE'LL COME AND SEE YOU NEXT HE SAID CHRISTMAS EVE SAID AILEEN CHRISTMAS EVE LET IT BE SAYS GEORGE
TURON STAR WHAT A GODSEND TO IT BUSH RANGERS STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS AGAIN
BUT WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED CHIEFLY BY THE APPELLATION OF STARLIGHT PLEASING WAY OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO A GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE SAYS STARLIGHT SMILING FIRST AND LOOKING RATHER GRIM AFTERWARDS NEVER MIND BOYS THEY'LL INCREASE THAT REWARD YET BY JOVE IT WILL HAVE TO BE A THOUSAND A PIECE IF THEY DON'T LOOK A LITTLE SHARPER
BUT THEY WAS MILES AWAY THEN BEFORE THE WILD BOY HAD COME TO THE END OF HIS STORY THE WOUNDED MAN HAD PROVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A DEAD FAINT AS THE WOMEN CALL IT NOT THE REAL THING
EVERY TREE AND BUSH BY THE ROADSIDE EVERY SOUND IN THE AIR EVERY STAR IN THE SKY
WE LAUGHED AND DAD GROWLED OUT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE PLUCK ANY ON YE TO TACKLE A BIG TOUCH AGAIN I EXPECT THEY'LL SEND A SUMMONS FOR US NEXT AND GET OLD BILL BARKIS THE BAILIFF AT BARGO TO SERVE IT COME COME GOVERNOR SAYS STARLIGHT NONE OF THAT
I FELT WHAT A FOOL I'D BEEN TO LET THINGS SLIDE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY RIGHT HAND TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THEM AS THEY WERE THREE SHORT YEARS BEFORE AT LAST WE GOT TO THE GAP IT WAS THE SHORTEST HALT FROM THEIR HOME
OF COURSE HE CAN BE FINED EVEN IMPRISONED FOR THIS WHEN HE IS CAUGHT IN THE ACT HEREIN LIES THE DIFFICULTY I FELT LIKE ANOTHER MAN AFTER A WASH A NIP AND A REAL GOOD MEAL WITH THE TWO GIRLS SITTING CLOSE BY AND CHATTERING AWAY AS USUAL
POOR LITTLE JEANIE WE'D NO RIGHT TO DRAG OTHER PEOPLE INTO OUR TROUBLES I BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE THE SOONER WE'RE SHOT OR LOCKED UP THE BETTER YOU WON'T THINK SO WHEN IT COMES OLD MAN I SAID
SO OVER AND ABOVE EARLY THOUGH STARLIGHT WAS UP AS FRESH AS PAINT AT SUNRISE YOU'D THOUGHT HE HADN'T RIDDEN A YARD THE DAY BEFORE EVEN AT THE VERY LAST THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO DO AND TO GET
UNKNOWN TO FATHER TOO HE GAVE US GOOD ADVICE WARNED US THAT WHAT WE WERE IN WAS THE ROAD TO IMPRISONMENT OR DEATH IN DUE COURSE AND NOT TO FLATTER OURSELVES THAT ANY OTHER ENDING WAS POSSIBLE
AND PAID US IN CASH OUT OF HIS SHARE OF THE NOTES
BUT YOU'VE BEEN AWAY YOURSELF
BEFORE WE WENT AWAY FATHER AND STARLIGHT HAD SOME TERRIBLE LONG TALKS AND ONE EVENING JIM CAME TO ME AND SAYS HE WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE UP TO NOW HOW SHOULD I KNOW STICKING UP A BANK OR BONING A FLOCK OF MAIDEN EWES TO TAKE UP A RUN WITH
ONLY EVERY NOW AND THEN HE'D LET OUT JUST AS HE DID NOW AS IF NOTHING COULD EVER SET HIM STRAIGHT AGAIN OR KEEP HIM FROM FIGHTING AGAINST THEM AS HE CALLED THE SWELLS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND EVERYBODY ALMOST THAT WAS STRAIGHTGOING AND HONEST
THE FIRST TWO DON'T LOOK LIKE COMING OFF I SAID YOU'RE THE LIKELIEST MAN TO MARRY AND SETTLE IF JEANIE STICKS TO YOU SHE'D BETTER GO DOWN TO THE PIER AND DROWN HERSELF COMFORTABLY SAID JIM
AND MANY ANOTHER CURRENCY CHAP CAN SAY THE SAME
IT LOOKED AS IF OUR LUCK WAS DEAD OUT AND WE BEGAN TO THINK OUR CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER TO QUEENSLAND AND CLEAR OUT OF THE COLONY THAT WAY LOOKED WORSE EVERY DAY DAD KEPT FORAGING ABOUT TO GET INFORMATION
FATHER SHOWED US A SORT OF CAVE BY THE SIDE OF THE TRACK WHERE ONE MAN WITH A COUPLE OF GUNS AND A PISTOL OR TWO COULD HAVE SHOT DOWN A SMALL REGIMENT AS THEY CAME DOWN ONE AT A TIME
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN BADLY WOUNDED THE OTHER TROOPER REPORTS THAT HE WAS SHOT DOWN AND THE PARTY ATTACKED BY PERSONS CONCEALED IN THE THICK TIMBER NEAR WILD HORSE CREEK AT THE EDGE OF BARGO BRUSH IN THE CONFUSION THAT ENSUED THE PRISONER ESCAPED IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT WALSH WAS FATALLY INJURED
THEN MISTER KNIGHTLEY BEGAN AGAIN HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE STOOD HE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF MORAN AND WALL THEY WERE A DEAL TOO QUIET FOR HIM AND HE COULD READ MEN'S FACES LIKE A BOOK
HAS BEEN FOR MONTHS A PARTNER IN THIS CLAIM
AFTER WE'D GOT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND ON THE FLAT LAND OF THE VALLEY IT RESTED OUR FEET A BIT THAT WAS PRETTY NIGH CUT TO PIECES WITH THE ROCKS OUR HORSES WERE THAT DONE WE DURSN'T RIDE EM FOR HOURS BEFORE
WHAT ABOUT JIM WHY THE P'LEECE GRABBED HIM OF COURSE YOU FELLERS DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING ON FOR EVER AND EVER KEEPIN THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF TERRORISM AS THE PAPERS SAY NO DICK IT'S WRONG AND WICKED AND SINFUL YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOCK UNDER AND GIVE US YOUNG UNS A CHANCE
I DON'T THINK I EVER KNEW JIM DO SO MUCH LYING BEFORE BUT AFTER HE'D BEGUN HE HAD TO STICK TO IT HE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS HE NEARLY BROKE DOWN ABOUT THE THREE DAUGHTERS
AND WE HADN'T MADE UP OUR MIND WHAT OUR LINE WAS TO BE ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE MORE ROW MADE ABOUT US THAN EVER
THE BANNER COMES NEXT SAYS STARLIGHT TEARING IT OPEN WE SHALL HAVE SOMETHING SHORT AND SWEET AFTER THE STAR HOW'S THIS STARLIGHT AGAIN THIS MERCURIAL BRIGAND IT WOULD APPEAR HAS PAID TURON ANOTHER VISIT
DISHONOURING TO THOSE THAT DIE AND TO THOSE THAT LIVE
THEY'LL BE HERE ABOUT DINNER TIME SO WE MUST GET READY FOR THEM WE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO GET OURSELVES OR ANYTHING ELSE READY IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THEM THROUGH A STRONG SPYGLASS WHICH FATHER BROUGHT OUT
ONE MAN WAS A BIT IN FRONT RIDING A FINE HORSE TOO
NOW SMALL PARTIES OF THESE MEN BOLD HARDY EXPERIENCED CHAPS WOULD TAKE A PICK AND SHOVEL A BUCKET AND A TIN DISH WITH A FEW WEEKS RATIONS AND SCOUR THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE
AND AFTER HE HAD TASTED A PANNIKIN FULL OF BRANDY AND WATER WHICH FATHER BROUGHT HIM HE SAT UP AND LOOKED LIKE A LIVING MAN ONCE MORE BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT MY SHOULDER HE SAID
THE FAMOUS OUTLAW HAD SHORTLY BEFORE QUITTED THE PLACE HAVING RECEIVED WARNING AND BEEN PROVIDED WITH A FAST HORSE BY HIS SINGULAR RETAINER WARRIGAL A HALF CASTE NATIVE OF THE COLONY WHO IS SAID TO BE DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM AND WHO HAS BEEN SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE TURON
BUT SOFT AS THEY SAY IN THE PLAY WHERE AM I I THOUGHT I WAS A VIRTUOUS MINER AGAIN HERE WE ARE AT THIS DEVIL DISCOVERED DEMON HAUNTED OLD HOLLOW AGAIN
WHICH HAD TURNED OUT SO BAD FOR US BOYS AND FOR MOTHER AND AILEEN BAD ENOUGH HE WAS IN A KIND OF WAY OLD DAD BUT HE WASN'T ALL BAD AND
THAT COMES NATURAL TO YOU NOW DICK DOESN'T IT I STARED FOR A BIT AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING IT WAS A RUM GO WASN'T IT THE SAME TALK FOR COWS AND CHRISTIANS THAT'S HOW THINGS GET STUCK INTO THE TALK IN A NEW COUNTRY
SO WHEN ALL CAME TO ALL WE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO LEARN HIM A LESSON TO STICK TO HIS OWN WORK BESIDES A THOUSAND OUNCES OF GOLD WAS NO FOOLISH TOUCH AND WE COULD KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
AND WENT STRAIGHT UP TO THE HUT WHERE THE MAN LIVED THAT LOOKED AFTER IT MOST OF THE DIGGERS THAT CARED ABOUT THEIR HORSES PAID FOR THEIR GRASS IN FARMERS AND SQUATTERS PADDOCKS THOUGH THE PRICE WAS PRETTY HIGH OLD BATES WHO HAD A BIT OF A GOOD GRASSED FLAT
THEN HE SAW IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND GAVE IT BEST NEVER MIND DICK MARSTON SAYS HE AS HE WALKED OFF AND HE FIXED HIS EYES ON ME THAT SAVAGE AND DEADLY LOOKING WITH THE BLOOD RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE THAT I COULDN'T HELP SHIVERING A BIT
FOR JAMES MARSTON WHO WAS MARRIED BUT A SHORT WHILE SINCE TO A MELBOURNE YOUNG LADY OF HIGH PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AND THE MOST WINNING AMIABILITY GREAT SYMPATHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY ALL CLASSES SO MUCH FOR THE STAR
HE CAME STEPPING DOWN THAT BEASTLY ROCKY GOAT TRACK HE A CLEAN THOROUGHBRED THAT OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE TROD UPON ANYTHING ROUGHER THAN A ROLLED TRAINING TRACK OR THE SOUND BUSH TURF
AS WE CAME CLOSE OUT WALKS OLD CRIB AND SMELLS AT US HE KNEW US IN A MINUTE AND JUMPED UP AND BEGAN TO TRY AND LICK JIM'S HAND THE OLD STORY
THEY'LL TAKE THEIR LUCK AS IT COMES LIKE OTHERS GROWLED FATHER WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ISN'T TOO BAD FOR THEM WE WANT ANOTHER HAND OR TWO TO WORK THINGS RIGHT
BUILT A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO BY A RICH SETTLER WHO WAS ONCE THE OWNER OF ALL THAT SIDE OF THE COUNTRY THE STAIRCASE WAS ALL STONE ORNAMENTED EVERY WAY IT COULD BE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE COULD WALK ABREAST EASY ENOUGH
A SLIGHT ACTIVE LOOKING CHAP ABOUT SIXTEEN THAT LOOKED AS IF HE COULD JUMP INTO A GUM TREE AND BACK AGAIN AND I BELIEVE HE COULD SERGEANT GORING HE VERY NEAR GRAB US AT DILLIGAH
YOU TUMBLE IN AND WE'LL TRY SAYS JIM FIRST MAN TO KEEP YOU FOR GOOD EH GRACEY IT'S FINE HOT WEATHER AND AILEEN SHALL SEE FAIR PLAY YOU'RE JUST AS SAUCY AS EVER JIM SAYS SHE BLUSHING AND SMILING
THEN BY DEGREES THEY USED TO CRAWL OUT BY MOONLIGHT AND COLLAR A HORSE OR TWO OR A FEW CATTLE THEY MANAGED TO LIVE THERE YEARS AND YEARS ONE DIED ONE WAS KILLED BY THE BLACKS THE LAST MAN SHOWED IT TO THE CHAPS THAT PASSED IT ON TO STARLIGHT
HOW DO YOU THINK HE LIKES IT WHAT BUSINESS THAT OF YOURS HE SAID YOU MIND YOUR WORK AND I'LL MIND MINE THIS IS THE WORST DAY'S WORK YOU'VE DONE THIS YEAR AND SO I TELL YOU
BUT WE WERE TO STALL THEM OFF BY SAYING WE'D BEEN HELPING HIM WITH A BIT OF BUSH WORK OR ANYTHING WE COULD THINK OFF IT'LL DO NO GOOD AND YOUR MOTHER'S QUITE MISERABLE ENOUGH AS IT IS BOYS HE SAID SHE'LL KNOW TIME ENOUGH AND MAYBE BREAK HER HEART OVER IT TOO POOR NORAH
STRONGER THAN EVER I WAS SURPRISED AT MYSELF AND LOOKED QUEER I DARESAY THEN AILEEN LAUGHED AND JIM COMES TO THE RESCUE AND SAYS DICK DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU GRACEY YOU'VE GROWN SUCH A SWELL TOO
FATHER GOT THE SPYGLASS ON TO EM AT LAST PRETTY CLEAR AND NEARLY THREW IT DOWN WITH AN OATH
COULDN'T THINK OF GOING BEFORE THE CAPTAIN SAYS MORAN WITH A GRIN I'LL FOLLOW WHERE YOU LEAD ALL RIGHT SAYS STARLIGHT HERE GOES AND HE STARTED TO WALK UPSTAIRS
SOME RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT MEN I BELIEVE SO THAT HALF CASTE CHAP TOLD ME AND A GIN SHOWED EM THE TRACK DOWN AND WHERE TO GET WATER AND EVERYTHING THEY LIVED ON KANGAROOS AT FIRST
AFTER BREAKFAST AILEEN AND I WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND HAD A LONG TALK OVER THE PLAN WE HAD CHALKED OUT FOR GETTING AWAY TO QUEENSLAND I GOT OUT A MAP STARLIGHT HAD MADE
WHICH I WAS SORRY FOR AS THE HALF CASTE AND I DIDN'T HIT IT WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN WE WERE BY OURSELVES HE GENERALLY MANAGED TO DO OR SAY SOMETHING HE KNEW I DIDN'T LIKE I KEPT MY HANDS OFF HIM ON ACCOUNT OF STARLIGHT
TALKING ABOUT THE PLACES I'D BEEN TO AND SHE WANTING TO KNOW EVERYTHING JIM DREW OFF A BIT WHEN THE ROAD GOT NARROW
AND I RUSHED AT HIM I BELIEVE HE'D HAVE KILLED ME THAT MINUTE IF HE'D HAD THE CHANCE AND HE MADE A DEUCED GOOD OFFER AT IT
THERE WE WERE STANDING AND LEANING ABOUT THE DARK HALL STARING AND WONDERING AND THESE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN TO MEET US LIKE GHOSTS WITHOUT SPEAKING OR ANYTHING ELSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY WAS A TALL HANDSOME MAN
AS WE RODE ALONG I SETTLED UPON THE WAY I'D TRY AND SET POOR JIM FREE BAD OFF AS I WAS MYSELF I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE HIM CHAINED UP
THAT'S OUR SORT ALL TO PIECES WELL WE'D BETTER COME IN GRACEY LL THINK WE'RE AFRAID TO FACE HER WHEN WE WENT AWAY LAST GRACE STOREFIELD WAS A LITTLE OVER SEVENTEEN
THE SOONER HE WAS SEEN TO THE BETTER CHANCE HE'D HAVE JIM BRIGHTENED UP CONSIDERABLY AFTER THIS HE TOLD ME HOW HE'D GONE BACK TO SAY GOOD BYE TO JEANIE HOW THE POOR GIRL WENT INTO FITS AND HE COULDN'T LEAVE HER BY THE TIME SHE GOT BETTER THE COTTAGE WAS SURROUNDED BY POLICE
AND HOW ABOUT KATE
WE NONE OF US FELT IN THE HUMOUR TO SAY MUCH AFTER THAT FATHER HAD GOT INTO ONE OF HIS TANTRUMS AND WHEN HE DID HE WAS FIT TO BE TIED ONLY I'D NOT HAVE TOOK THE CONTRACT FOR SOMETHING
ALSO THE SCABBARD OF BALIN'S SWORD MERLIN LEFT IT ON THIS SIDE THE ISLAND THAT GALAHAD SHOULD FIND IT ALSO MERLIN
FOR WELL I KNOW HIM SAID SIR TRISTRAM FOR ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS LIVING IN THIS REALM THEN THAT OLD KNIGHT TOOK A LITTLE HACKNEY
AND EITHER BARE OTHER DOWN HORSE AND ALL TO THE EARTH THEN THEY AVOIDED THEIR HORSES AND LASHED TOGETHER EAGERLY WITH SWORDS
IT SEEMETH BY YOU SAID KING ARTHUR THAT YE KNOW HIS NAME AND FROM WHENCE HE IS COME AND OF WHAT BLOOD HE IS I SUPPOSE I DO SO SAID LAUNCELOT OR ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD BUT HE GAVE ME SUCH CHARGE AT THAT TIME THAT I SHOULD NEVER DISCOVER HIM UNTIL HE REQUIRED ME
OF A CLEAN MAID AND A KING'S DAUGHTER AND THEREFORE THE CUSTOM OF THIS CASTLE IS THERE SHALL NO DAMOSEL PASS THIS WAY BUT SHE SHALL BLEED OF HER BLOOD IN A SILVER DISH FULL WELL SAID BALIN SHE SHALL BLEED AS MUCH AS SHE MAY BLEED
WHEN SIR SAGRAMORE SAW HIS FELLOW HAVE SUCH A FALL HE MARVELLED WHAT KNIGHT HE MIGHT BE AND HE DRESSED HIS SPEAR WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SIR TRISTRAM AGAINST HIM AND THEY CAME TOGETHER AS THE THUNDER
AND HURTLED TOGETHER THAT SOMETIME THEY FELL GROVELLING TO THE EARTH AND AT SOME TIME THEY WERE SO AMAZED THAT EITHER TOOK OTHER'S SWORD INSTEAD OF HIS OWN THUS THEY ENDURED TILL EVENSONG TIME THAT THERE WAS NONE THAT BEHELD THEM MIGHT KNOW WHETHER WAS LIKE TO WIN THE BATTLE AND THEIR ARMOUR WAS SO FORHEWN
THEREFORE SAID SIR TRISTRAM YE SHALL LEAVE ALL YOUR MALICE AND SO WILL I
AND HER GOODNESS THAT KING MARK SAID THAT HE WOULD WED HER WHEREUPON HE PRAYED SIR TRISTRAM TO TAKE HIS WAY INTO IRELAND FOR HIM ON MESSAGE
WHY BE YE SO HEAVY TELL ME AND I WILL AMEND IT AN I MAY TO MY POWER SIR KNIGHT SAID HE AGAIN THOU DOST ME GREAT GRIEF FOR I WAS IN MERRY THOUGHTS AND NOW THOU PUTTEST ME TO MORE PAIN
AND SIR LUCAN SMOTE DOWN SIR DANAME OVER HIS HORSE'S CROUP AND THEN HE FLED INTO THAT PLACE AND SIR LUCAN RODE AFTER HIM AND ASKED AFTER HIM MANY TIMES THEN SIR DINADAN SAID TO SIR TRISTRAM
THEREFORE TAKE MY HORSE THAT IS BETTER THAN YOURS AND RIDE TO THE DAMOSEL AND FOLLOW THE QUEST THAT I WAS IN AS SHE WILL LEAD YOU AND REVENGE MY DEATH WHEN YE MAY THAT SHALL I DO SAID BALIN AND THAT I MAKE VOW UNTO KNIGHTHOOD
I LITTLE WEENED TO HAVE MET WITH YOU AT THIS SUDDEN ADVENTURE I AM RIGHT GLAD OF YOUR DELIVERANCE OUT OF YOUR DOLOROUS PRISONMENT FOR A MAN TOLD ME IN THE CASTLE OF FOUR STONES
BUT AS LONG AS KING MARK LIVED HE LOVED NEVER SIR TRISTRAM AFTER THAT
AND IF THEY WILL NOT I SHALL DO BATTLE WITH THEM AND IN THE DEFENCE OF YOUR RIGHT GRAMERCY SAID THE LADY AND THEREAS I MAY NOT ACQUIT YOU GOD SHALL
I AM RIGHT HEAVY THAT MY LORD ARTHUR IS DISPLEASED WITH ME FOR HE IS THE MOST WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT THAT REIGNETH NOW ON EARTH AND HIS LOVE WILL I GET OR ELSE WILL I PUT MY LIFE IN ADVENTURE
AND SO WITHIN TWELVE DAYS THEY CAME TO CAMELOT AND THE KING WAS PASSING GLAD OF THEIR COMING AND SO WAS ALL THE COURT THEN THE KING MADE THEM TO SWEAR UPON A BOOK
AND EACH ONE OF THEM HELD A TAPER OF WAX THAT BURNT DAY AND NIGHT AND KING ARTHUR WAS MADE IN SIGN OF A FIGURE STANDING ABOVE THEM WITH A SWORD DRAWN IN HIS HAND AND ALL THE TWELVE FIGURES HAD COUNTENANCE LIKE UNTO MEN THAT WERE OVERCOME ALL THIS MADE MERLIN BY HIS SUBTLE CRAFT
THAT DID SO MARVELLOUS DEEDS OF ARMS THAT HE WONDERED SORE WHAT KNIGHT HE MIGHT BE AND WELL HE WIST IT WAS NOT SIR LAUNCELOT AND IT WAS TOLD HIM THAT SIR TRISTRAM WAS IN PETIT BRITAIN WITH ISOUD LA BLANCHE MAINS
AND BADE HIM ARM HIM AND MAKE HIM READY SO ANON KING ARTHUR AND SIR UWAINE DRESSED THEM BEFORE SIR TRISTRAM AND REQUIRED HIM TO TELL THEM WHERE HE HAD THAT SHIELD SIR HE SAID I HAD IT OF QUEEN MORGAN LE FAY SISTER UNTO KING ARTHUR
AND SHE PRAYED ME AS THAT I LOVED HER HEARTILY THAT I WOULD MAKE HER A PROMISE BY THE FAITH OF MY KNIGHTHOOD FOR TO LABOUR DAILY IN ARMS UNTO I MET WITH ONE OF THEM AND ALL THAT I MIGHT OVERCOME I SHOULD PUT THEM UNTO A VILLAINOUS DEATH AND THIS IS THE CAUSE THAT I HAVE PUT ALL THESE KNIGHTS TO DEATH
AFTER THIS MERLIN TOLD UNTO KING ARTHUR OF THE PROPHECY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A GREAT BATTLE BESIDE SALISBURY
THEN BALAN YEDE ON ALL FOUR FEET AND HANDS AND PUT OFF THE HELM OFF HIS BROTHER AND MIGHT NOT KNOW HIM BY THE VISAGE IT WAS SO FUL HEWN AND BLED
THEREFORE THINK NOT THE CONTRARY YE SHALL REPENT IT FOR SUCH ANOTHER DESPITE HAD I NEVER IN MY COURT THEREFORE WITHDRAW YOU OUT OF MY COURT IN ALL HASTE YE MAY THEN BALIN TOOK UP THE HEAD OF THE LADY AND BARE IT WITH HIM TO HIS HOSTELRY
THEN SAID SIR TRISTRAM I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOUR MAUGRE AGAINST ME BUT I WILL NOT MEDDLE WITH YOU
THEN ANON THE KING COMMANDED TO LEAVE THE ASSAULT AND ANON THE DUKE'S OLDEST SON BROUGHT OUT THE KEYS AND KNEELING DELIVERED THEM TO THE KING AND BESOUGHT HIM OF GRACE AND THE KING SEIZED THE TOWN BY ASSENT OF HIS LORDS AND TOOK THE DUKE AND SENT HIM TO DOVER THERE FOR TO ABIDE PRISONER TERM OF HIS LIFE
UP HIS SHIELD AND SMOTE HIM THROUGH THE SHIELD AND TAMED HIS HELM THEN BALIN
AND THEREFORE I REQUIRE YOU OF KNIGHTHOOD TO AVENGE ME
AND BROUGHT WITH THEM KING RIENCE OF NORTH WALES AND THERE DELIVERED HIM TO THE PORTERS AND CHARGED THEM WITH HIM AND SO THEY TWO RETURNED AGAIN IN THE DAWNING OF THE DAY KING ARTHUR CAME THEN TO KING RIENCE AND SAID SIR KING YE ARE WELCOME BY WHAT ADVENTURE COME YE HITHER
THIS IS A FAIR SHIELD AND A MIGHTY BUT WHAT SIGNIFIETH THIS KING AND THIS QUEEN AND THE KNIGHT STANDING UPON BOTH THEIR HEADS I SHALL TELL YOU SAID MORGAN LE FAY
BUT I WILL NOT LOSE THE LIFE OF HER WHILES MY LIFE LASTETH AND SO BALIN MADE HER TO BLEED BY HER GOOD WILL BUT HER BLOOD HELPED NOT THE LADY AND SO HE AND SHE RESTED THERE ALL NIGHT AND HAD THERE RIGHT GOOD CHEER AND ON THE MORN THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAYS
SO GOD ME HELP I WILL NEVER GO WITH HIM FOR HE THAT I LOVED MOST I WEENED HE HAD LOVED ME AND THEREFORE SIR TRISTRAM SHE SAID RIDE AS THOU CAME FOR THOUGH THOU HADDEST OVERCOME THIS KNIGHT AS YE WAS LIKELY
ME REPENTETH SAID BALIN THAT EVER I CAME WITHIN THIS COUNTRY
THAT IS NOT SO SAID SIR TRISTRAM FOR I HAVE MET WITH THEM BOTH AND I FELT SIR GAHERIS FOR THE BETTER KNIGHT AND SIR LAMORAK I CALL HIM AS GOOD AS ANY OF THEM EXCEPT SIR LAUNCELOT WHY NAME YE NOT SIR TRISTRAM SAID HIS HOST
MAKE YOU READY SAID THE KNIGHT LANCEOR AND DRESS YOU UNTO ME FOR THAT ONE SHALL ABIDE IN THE FIELD THEN THEY TOOK THEIR SPEARS AND CAME TOGETHER AS MUCH AS THEIR HORSES MIGHT DRIVE AND THE IRISH KNIGHT SMOTE BALIN ON THE SHIELD THAT ALL WENT SHIVERS OFF HIS SPEAR
SO SIR TRISTRAM MANY DAYS AFTER FOUGHT WITH SIR MARHAUS IN AN ISLAND AND THERE THEY DID A GREAT BATTLE BUT AT THE LAST SIR TRISTRAM SLEW HIM SO SIR TRISTRAM WAS WOUNDED
AND HOW BALIN AND BALAN FOUGHT TOGETHER THE MARVELLEST BATTLE THAT EVER WAS HEARD OF AND HOW THEY WERE BURIED BOTH IN ONE TOMB ALAS SAID KING ARTHUR
TWO BODIES THOU HAST SLAIN AND ONE HEART AND TWO HEARTS IN ONE BODY AND TWO SOULS THOU HAST LOST AND THEREWITH SHE TOOK THE SWORD FROM HER LOVE THAT LAY DEAD AND FELL TO THE GROUND IN A SWOON
SO WHEN THE KING WAS COME THITHER WITH ALL HIS BARONAGE AND LODGED AS THEY SEEMED BEST THERE WAS COME A DAMOSEL THE WHICH WAS SENT ON MESSAGE FROM THE GREAT LADY LILE OF AVELION AND WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE KING ARTHUR
THAT WE CALL ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD THAT IS TRUTH SAID SIR TRISTRAM SIR LAUNCELOT IS CALLED PEERLESS OF COURTESY AND OF KNIGHTHOOD AND FOR HIS SAKE SAID SIR TRISTRAM I WILL NOT WITH MY GOOD WILL FIGHT NO MORE WITH YOU
AND FOR HER SAKE I SHALL OWE ALL WOMEN THE BETTER LOVE ALAS SAID THE DWARF THOU HAST DONE GREAT DAMAGE UNTO THYSELF FOR THIS KNIGHT THAT IS HERE DEAD WAS ONE OF THE MOST VALIANTEST MEN THAT LIVED AND TRUST WELL BALIN
AND MUCH HARM HE WILL DO AN HE LIVE THEREWITH
A MIGHT THAT THEY LAY BOTH GROVELLING ON THE GROUND THEN SIR BLEOBERIS DE GANIS STERT ABACK
THE DAMOSEL BEHELD THE POOR KNIGHT AND SAW HE WAS A LIKELY MAN BUT FOR HIS POOR ARRAYMENT SHE THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE OF NO WORSHIP WITHOUT VILLAINY OR TREACHERY AND THEN SHE SAID UNTO THE KNIGHT SIR IT NEEDETH NOT TO PUT ME TO MORE PAIN OR LABOUR
AND IN ESPECIAL MOST FOR YOUR SAKE SIR TRISTRAM AND IF SHE WOULD GO WITH YOU I WOULD YE HAD HER I THANK YOU SAID SIR TRISTRAM BUT FOR HER LOVE I SHALL BEWARE
AND THEN LARGELY KING MELIODAS AND HIS QUEEN DEPARTED OF THEIR LANDS AND GOODS TO SIR TRISTRAM THEN BY THE LICENSE OF KING MELIODAS HIS FATHER HE RETURNED AGAIN UNTO THE COURT OF KING MARK AND THERE HE LIVED IN GREAT JOY LONG TIME
THAT DO I NOT FOR IT IS THE CUSTOM OF MY COUNTRY
WHEN SIR TRISTRAM SAW THE PEOPLE DRAW UNTO HIM HE REMEMBERED HE WAS NAKED AND SPERD FAST THE CHAPEL DOOR AND BRAKE THE BARS OF A WINDOW
SO A DAMOSEL CAME IN TO THEM AND FOUND THEM MOURNING THEN SHE WENT UNTO SIR DARRAS AND TOLD HIM HOW THAT MIGHTY KNIGHT THAT BARE THE BLACK SHIELD WAS LIKELY TO DIE THAT SHALL NOT BE SAID SIR DARRAS FOR GOD DEFEND WHEN KNIGHTS COME TO ME FOR SUCCOUR
OR ELSE THE DAMOSEL'S HEAD THAT BROUGHT IT I TAKE NO FORCE THOUGH I HAVE BOTH THEIR HEADS FOR HE SLEW MY BROTHER A GOOD KNIGHT AND A TRUE AND THAT GENTLEWOMAN WAS CAUSER OF MY FATHER'S DEATH TRULY SAID KING ARTHUR
AND SWARE A GREAT OATH THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURNT AND THE OTHER LADIES THEN THE BARONS GATHERED THEM TOGETHER AND SAID PLAINLY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THOSE LADIES BURNT
OR ELSE I WILL DO THE UTTERMOST TO YOU ALL THEN THE DUKE SAW HE MIGHT NOT ESCAPE THE DEATH HE CRIED TO HIS SONS AND CHARGED THEM TO YIELD THEM TO SIR MARHAUS AND THEY KNEELED ALL DOWN
AND SHE CAME TO SIR TRISTRAM AND TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE WHOLE BY NO MEANS FOR THY LADY LA BEALE ISOUD MAY NOT HELP THEE THEREFORE SHE BIDDETH YOU HASTE INTO BRITTANY TO KING HOWEL AND THERE YE SHALL FIND HIS DAUGHTER
FOR I DARE SAY THERE WAS NEVER GENTLEWOMAN REVILED MAN IN SO FOUL A MANNER AS I HAVE REBUKED HIM AND AT ALL TIMES HE GAVE ME GOODLY AND MEEK ANSWERS AGAIN AND AS THEY SAT THUS TALKING
AND SO HE WAS FOR HE SAW HIM SIT UNDER A TREE OF HOLLY AND MANY CLUBS OF IRON AND GISARMS ABOUT HIM SO THIS KNIGHT DRESSED HIM TO THE GIANT PUTTING HIS SHIELD AFORE HIM AND THE GIANT TOOK AN IRON CLUB IN HIS HAND
I CAN TELL YOU WHEREFORE YE RIDE THIS WAY FOR TO MEET KING RIENCE BUT IT WILL NOT AVAIL YOU WITHOUT YE HAVE MY COUNSEL AH SAID BALIN YE ARE MERLIN WE WILL BE RULED BY YOUR COUNSEL COME ON SAID MERLIN YE SHALL HAVE GREAT WORSHIP

THOU HAST DONE THYSELF GREAT HURT BECAUSE THAT THOU SAVEST NOT THIS LADY THAT SLEW HERSELF THAT MIGHT HAVE SAVED HER AN THOU WOULDEST BY THE FAITH OF MY BODY SAID BALIN I MIGHT NOT SAVE HER FOR SHE SLEW HERSELF SUDDENLY ME REPENTETH SAID MERLIN
WHEN THAT I HAVE DONE THIS BATTLE IF GOD GIVE ME GRACE THAT I SPEED THAT YE SHALL GIVE ME A REWARD
AND WITH THAT HE SAW AN EARL CALLED SIR ETHELWOLD AND THE DUKE OF DUTCHMEN CAME LEAPING OUT OF A WOOD WITH MANY THOUSANDS AND PRIAMUS KNIGHTS AND CAME STRAIGHT UNTO THE BATTLE THEN SIR GAWAINE COMFORTED HIS KNIGHTS AND BADE THEM NOT TO BE ABASHED FOR ALL SHALL BE OURS
WHAT TIDINGS THERE WERE IN THE REALM OF LOGRIS SIR SAID SIR GAHERIS THE KING REIGNETH AS A NOBLE KNIGHT AND NOW BUT LATE THERE WAS A GREAT JOUSTS AND TOURNAMENT AS EVER I SAW ANY IN THE REALM OF LOGRIS
BUT PELLEAS LOVED NEVER AFTER SIR GAWAINE BUT AS HE SPARED HIM FOR THE LOVE OF KING ARTHUR BUT OFTTIMES AT JOUSTS AND TOURNAMENTS SIR PELLEAS QUIT SIR GAWAINE FOR SO IT REHEARSETH IN THE BOOK OF FRENCH
AH SAID MERLIN I SHALL TELL YOU IT IS BALIN THAT ACHIEVED THE SWORD AND HIS BROTHER BALAN A GOOD KNIGHT THERE LIVETH NOT A BETTER OF PROWESS AND OF WORTHINESS AND IT SHALL BE THE GREATEST DOLE OF HIM THAT EVER I KNEW OF KNIGHT FOR HE SHALL NOT LONG ENDURE
AND THEN WAS HE BOUND HAND AND FOOT AND SO WAS HE KEPT UNTIL DAY AND THEN BY THE ASSENT OF KING MARK AND OF SIR ANDRED AND OF SOME OF THE BARONS SIR TRISTRAM WAS LED UNTO A CHAPEL THAT STOOD UPON THE SEA ROCKS
AND NAMELY BALIN PASSETH OF PROWESS OF ANY KNIGHT THAT EVER I FOUND FOR MUCH BEHOLDEN AM I UNTO HIM WOULD GOD HE WOULD ABIDE WITH ME SIR SAID MERLIN LOOK YE KEEP WELL THE SCABBARD OF EXCALIBUR FOR YE SHALL LOSE NO BLOOD WHILE YE HAVE THE SCABBARD UPON YOU
AND THERE WERE BROUGHT HIM ROBES TO HIS PLEASURE
AND SO THE CIRCLET OF GOLD WAS REWARDED HIM THEN HE DEPARTED FROM THEM WITH GREAT WORSHIP AND SO WITHIN SEVEN NIGHTS
THOUGH YE HAVE AS MANY WOUNDS UPON YOU AS YE MAY HAVE SO AFTER FOR GREAT TRUST ARTHUR BETOOK THE SCABBARD TO MORGAN LE FAY HIS SISTER AND SHE LOVED ANOTHER KNIGHT BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND KING URIENS OR KING ARTHUR AND SHE WOULD HAVE HAD ARTHUR HER BROTHER SLAIN
SUNDER AND WHEN BALIN WAS WEAPONLESS HE RAN INTO A CHAMBER FOR TO SEEK SOME WEAPON AND SO FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND NO WEAPON HE COULD FIND AND ALWAYS KING PELLAM AFTER HIM AND AT THE LAST HE ENTERED INTO A CHAMBER THAT WAS MARVELLOUSLY WELL DIGHT AND RICHLY
BUT OF ALL THESE TWELVE KINGS KING ARTHUR LET MAKE THE TOMB OF KING LOT PASSING RICHLY AND MADE HIS TOMB BY HIS OWN AND THEN ARTHUR LET MAKE TWELVE IMAGES OF LATTEN AND COPPER AND OVER GILT IT WITH GOLD IN THE SIGN OF TWELVE KINGS
AND THAT SAME DAY BEGAN THE GREAT FEAST AND SO THEY ALIGHTED AND STABLED THEIR HORSES AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE BUT BALIN'S HOST MIGHT NOT BE LET IN BECAUSE HE HAD NO LADY THEN BALIN WAS WELL RECEIVED AND BROUGHT UNTO A CHAMBER AND UNARMED HIM
TILL YE MAY FIND HIM SLEEPING FOR I AM SURE IN HIS HEAVINESS HE WILL ALIGHT DOWN IN SOME PLACE AND LIE HIM DOWN TO SLEEP AND THEREFORE HAVE YE YOUR WAIT UPON HIM AND IN THE PRIVIEST MANNER YE CAN TAKE HIS DWARF AND GO YE YOUR WAY WITH HIM AS FAST AS EVER YE MAY OR SIR BEAUMAINS AWAKE
ALAS SAID KING ARTHUR THAT IS GREAT PITY FOR I AM MUCH BEHOLDEN UNTO HIM AND I HAVE ILL DESERVED IT UNTO HIM FOR HIS KINDNESS NAY SAID MERLIN HE SHALL DO MUCH MORE FOR YOU
AND THERE HE PIGHT HIS PAVILIONS AND SOUGHT THROUGH ALL THE COUNTRY TO FIND A TOMB AND IN A CHURCH THEY FOUND ONE WAS FAIR AND RICH AND THEN THE KING LET PUT THEM BOTH IN THE EARTH AND PUT THE TOMB UPON THEM AND WROTE THE NAMES OF THEM BOTH ON THE TOMB
I WILL DO MORE FOR YOUR LORDSHIP THAN THAT SAID BALIN AND SO HE RODE MORE THAN A PACE AND FOUND THE KNIGHT WITH A DAMOSEL IN A FOREST AND SAID SIR KNIGHT YE MUST COME WITH ME UNTO KING ARTHUR FOR TO TELL HIM OF YOUR SORROW
THE KIN OF THIS KNIGHT WILL CHASE YOU THROUGH THE WORLD TILL THEY HAVE SLAIN YOU AS FOR THAT SAID BALIN I FEAR NOT GREATLY BUT I AM RIGHT HEAVY THAT I HAVE DISPLEASED MY LORD KING ARTHUR FOR THE DEATH OF THIS KNIGHT SO AS THEY TALKED TOGETHER THERE CAME A KING OF CORNWALL RIDING
ALAS SAID SIR ECTOR
FOR THE KING WAS NIGH THEM THAT WAS STOLEN AWAY FROM HIS HOST WITH A THREE SCORE HORSES OF HIS BEST KNIGHTS AND TWENTY OF THEM RODE TO FORE TO WARN THE LADY DE VANCE THAT THE KING WAS COMING FOR THAT NIGHT KING RIENCE SHOULD HAVE LAIN WITH HER WHICH IS THE KING SAID BALIN
AND LET SEE NOW IF YE CAN SKIFT IT WITH YOUR HANDS
NOR TO ME SEMBLABLE I WAS SENT INTO THIS WAR WITH SEVEN SCORE KNIGHTS
AND WHEN HE SAW SIR LUCAN SO HURT HE CALLED SIR TRISTRAM TO JOUST WITH HIM FAIR KNIGHT SAID SIR TRISTRAM TELL ME YOUR NAME I REQUIRE YOU
ALAS SAID BALIN IT IS NOT THE FIRST DESPITE HE HATH DONE ME AND THERE THE HERMIT AND BALIN BURIED THE KNIGHT UNDER A RICH STONE AND A TOMB ROYAL AND ON THE MORN THEY FOUND LETTERS OF GOLD WRITTEN
BUT SIR DARRAS WOULD NOT SUFFER THAT BUT KEPT THEM IN PRISON AND MEAT AND DRINK THEY HAD SO SIR TRISTRAM ENDURED THERE GREAT PAIN FOR SICKNESS HAD UNDERTAKEN HIM AND THAT IS THE GREATEST PAIN A PRISONER MAY HAVE
I WILL WELL SAID SIR LAMORAK THAT YE HAVE SEEN ME AND MET WITH ME FAIR SIR SAID SIR TRISTRAM TELL ME YOUR NAME UPON A COVENANT I WILL TELL YOU SAID SIR LAMORAK THAT IS THAT YE WILL TELL ME WHETHER YE BE LORD OF THIS ISLAND OR NO
WITH THAT MERLIN WAS VANISHED AND CAME TO KING ARTHUR AFOREHAND AND TOLD HIM HOW HIS MOST ENEMY WAS TAKEN AND DISCOMFITED BY WHOM SAID KING ARTHUR BY TWO KNIGHTS SAID MERLIN THAT WOULD PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP AND TO MORROW YE SHALL KNOW WHAT KNIGHTS THEY ARE
SAID SIR DINAS I SHALL NEVER TRUST THEM THAT ONCE BETRAYED ME AND THEREFORE AS YE HAVE BEGUN SO END FOR I WILL NEVER MEDDLE WITH YOU AND SO SIR DINAS DEPARTED AND TOOK HIS BRACHETS WITH HIM
SHE WENT TO THE LADY LILE OF AVELION AND BESOUGHT HER OF HELP
THEN BALIN WENT THROUGH ALL THE CHAMBERS AGAIN AND TOLD THE KNIGHT HOW HE FOUND HER
SO WHEN KING ANGUISH UNDERSTOOD HIS ACCUSING HE WAS PASSING HEAVY FOR HE KNEW SIR BLAMORE DE GANIS THAT HE WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT AND OF NOBLE KNIGHTS COME THEN THE KING OF IRELAND WAS SIMPLY PURVEYED OF HIS ANSWER
WHICH WERE SORE BESTEAD WITH THEIR ENEMIES SIR GRIEVE YOU NOT SAID SIR GAWAINE FOR THEIR GREE SHALL BE THEIRS I SHALL NOT ONCE MOVE MY HORSE TO THEM WARD BUT IF I SEE MORE THAN THERE BE FOR THEY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MATCH THEM
SAID THESE TWO KNIGHTS SO THEY RODE MORE THAN A PACE TILL THAT THEY CAME TO A FAIR CASTLE WELL WALLED AND DITCHED I WILL INTO THE CASTLE SAID BALIN AND LOOK IF SHE BE THERE SO HE WENT IN AND SEARCHED FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND FOUND HER BED BUT SHE WAS NOT THERE
