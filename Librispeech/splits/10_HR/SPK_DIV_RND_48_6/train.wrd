BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF EVERY CITY
WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE THE HIGH PRIEST ELIACHIM CALLED ALSO JOACHIM THE TRANSACTIONS HEREIN RELATED MOST PROBABLY HAPPENED IN HIS DAYS AND IN THE REIGN OF MANASSES AFTER HIS REPENTANCE AND RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY
THE GOVERNMENT RESOLVED TO PUNISH HIM WITHOUT ONE ORDERS CAME FROM WHITEHALL THAT HE SHOULD BE EJECTED AND THOSE ORDERS THE DEAN AND CANONS MADE HASTE TO OBEY
RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
LEST HE SHOULD DO THE SAME TO JERUSALEM AND TO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
WE CANNOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL DEFEND THEM
AND THEY PRAYED ALL THE NIGHT LONG WITHIN THE CHURCH DESIRING HELP OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
AND TO ALL BY WHOM THERE MIGHT BE A PASSAGE OF WAY THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ASCENTS OF THE MOUNTAINS BY WHICH THERE MIGHT BE ANY WAY TO JERUSALEM
AND SETTING HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE ASKED HIM
SO THAT THE WATERS WERE MADE TO STAND FIRM AS A WALL ON EITHER SIDE
ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
WENT THROUGH THE PLAINS BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
HAVE DESPISED US AND HAVE NOT COME OUT TO MEET US
THAT THE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CITIES BOTH PRINCES AND NOBLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
IF THERE BE ANY INIQUITY OF THEIRS IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR GOD LET US GO UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL SURELY DELIVER THEM TO THEE
AND THEN THE SWORD OF MY SOLDIERS SHALL PASS THROUGH THY SIDES AND THOU SHALT BE STABBED AND FALL AMONG THE WOUNDED OF ISRAEL
IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THAT ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN BY WHOSE VIRTUE AND FORTITUDE AND ARMED WITH PRAYER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE PRESERVED FROM THE DESTRUCTION THREATENED THEM BY HOLOFERNES AND HIS GREAT ARMY
AND THEY REFRESHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH THE WATERS
WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
AND EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD NOW RISE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO WELCOME HIM HE REMEMBERED THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE SOLDIERS HAD ALWAYS BORNE HIM AND FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT THEY WOULD COME OVER TO HIM BY REGIMENTS
BEHOLD FROM THIS HOUR THOU SHALT BE ASSOCIATED TO THEIR PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY SHALL RECEIVE THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FROM MY SWORD
SWORE BY HIS THRONE AND KINGDOM THAT HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
HERE THE EARL PUBLISHED A MANIFESTO DRAWN UP IN HOLLAND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMITTEE BY JAMES STEWART A SCOTCH ADVOCATE WHOSE PEN WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER EMPLOYED IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE WHERE THE BRITISH EXILES HAD CONGREGATED AND WHERE THEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN FITTED OUT WAS THE RICH AND POPULOUS AMSTERDAM AND THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM WERE THE HEADS OF THE FACTION HOSTILE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
AND SO LEFT HIM BOUND WITH ROPES
AND HE SET ALL THE CORN ON FIRE
AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
LET NOT THY COUNTENANCE SINK AND LET THE PALENESS THAT IS IN THY FACE DEPART FROM THEE
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEING ASKED BY HOLOFERNES
THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
AS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES SO THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES
MESOPOTAMIA AND SYRIA SOBAL AND LIBYA
AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
SOME WERE FOR PROCEEDING WITHOUT DELAY TO ARGYLESHIRE AT LAST THE EARL SEIZED SOME GENTLEMEN WHO LIVED NEAR THE COAST OF THE ISLAND AND PROPOSED TO THE BISHOP AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS THE BISHOP RETURNED NO ANSWER AND THE FLEET
THAT THE NATION OF ISRAEL IS DEFENDED BY THEIR GOD
THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL PREPARED THEMSELVES TO RESIST
WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
WAS DESPATCHED TO THE ADMIRALTY OF AMSTERDAM BUT THIS ORDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MISINFORMATION DID NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF THE SHIPS THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN THE TEXEL
DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
HAD COMMANDED HIM TO BE DELIVERED FOR THIS CAUSE TO THE ISRAELITES THAT WHEN HE SHOULD OVERCOME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THEN HE MIGHT COMMAND ACHIOR ALSO HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH BY DIVERSE TORMENTS FOR HAVING SAID
THE CHURCH THAT IS THE SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE WHERE THEY MET FOR PRAYER JUDITH CHAPTER SEVEN HOLOFERNES BESIEGETH BETHULIA
BUT THIS WAS NOT EASY LOCKE HAD AT OXFORD ABSTAINED FROM EXPRESSING ANY OPINION ON THE POLITICS OF THE DAY SPIES HAD BEEN SET ABOUT HIM DOCTORS OF DIVINITY AND MASTERS OF ARTS
THAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT NOT BE MADE A PREY AND THEIR WIVES CARRIED OFF AND THEIR CITIES DESTROYED AND THEIR HOLY THINGS PROFANED
HE DESTROYETH THEIR CITIES AND THEIR GODS
JUDITH CHAPTER FIVE
AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
AND HE FORCED ALL THE STATELY CITIES THAT WERE THERE FROM THE TORRENT OF MAMBRE
NABUCHODONOSOR THE KING CALLED HOLOFERNES
IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
LET US GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEN THE BRAVEST OF THEM SHALL BE TAKEN
TAKEN AN IMPRESS FROM THE SOCIETY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AMBITIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED REVIVED IN HIS BOSOM HE REMEMBERED THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GREETED BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY
LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
WILDMAN WHO LOVED TO TALK TREASON IN PARABLES SENT TO SAY THAT THE EARL OF RICHMOND JUST TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HAD LANDED IN ENGLAND WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN AND HAD A FEW DAYS LATER BEEN CROWNED ON THE FIELD OF BOSWORTH
OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
BUT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT ARGYLE WOULD SHORTLY APPEAR IN ARMS AMONG HIS CLANSMEN A PROCLAMATION WAS ACCORDINGLY ISSUED DIRECTING THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO BE IN READINESS
LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
AND OF THE HETHITES AND OF THE HEVITES AND OF THE AMORRHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY ONES IN HESEBON
ARGYLE HAS THE GREATEST MEANS OF ANNOYING ME AND OF ALL PLACES HOLLAND IS THAT WHENCE A BLOW MAY BE BEST AIMED AGAINST ME THE DUTCH ENVOYS ASSURED HIS MAJESTY THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID SHOULD INSTANTLY BE COMMUNICATED TO THE GOVERNMENT
WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
WHERE THE EXPEDITION SHOULD LAND TO APPOINT OFFICERS TO SUPERINTEND THE LEVYING OF TROOPS TO DOLE OUT PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL WAS TO DIRECT THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FIELD
WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
AND HE WENT UP TO ALL THEIR CASTLES
THAT TRUSTED IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND IN HIS POWER AND IN HIS ARMY AND IN HIS SHIELDS AND IN HIS CHARIOTS AND IN HIS HORSEMEN NOT BY FIGHTING WITH THE SWORD
WHO HAD LONG RESIDED IN ENGLAND AS AMBASSADOR FROM THE UNITED PROVINCES AND EVERARD VAN DYKVELT WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES HAD BEEN SENT BY THE STATE GENERAL ON A SPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE AND CONGRATULATION
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
WHAT HE SHRIEKED JUMPING OUT OF BED INTO THE BATH WHO THE THUNDER PUT THIS THING HERE WE TOLD HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOL NOT TO SEE THE BATH WE FINISHED DRESSING
HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
NOONDAY SPLENDOR NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS NOTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE NOTEWORTHY FRIENDSHIP NOTICEABLY BEGRIMED
SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS
REALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD YES I'LL GO SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU WHO SAW AT ONCE FROM THE DOCTOR'S FACE THAT HE WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO THE ANIMALS HERE
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM
AND THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE CORPSE'S BROTHER AT LAST AN EMPTY CAB TURNED UP IT IS A STREET WHERE AS A RULE AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT WANTED EMPTY CABS PASS AT THE RATE OF THREE A MINUTE AND HANG ABOUT AND GET IN YOUR WAY
OUTSTRETCHING SYMPATHIES OUTWARD POMP OUTWORN CREED OVERBEARING STYLE OVERESTIMATED IMPORTANCE
OVERFLOWING SYMPATHY OVERHANGING DARKNESS OVERMASTERING POTENCY OVERPOWERING ARGUMENT
USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER
NOTORIOUSLY PROFLIGATE NOVEL
A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
OR GROOMING ME THOROUGHLY HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THAT THAN IF I HAD BEEN A COW HE LEFT MY BIT RUSTY MY SADDLE DAMP AND MY CRUPPER STIFF ALFRED SMIRK
THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS STARTED OUT TO GO BACK TO THE SEASHORE
WHO WAS PACKING THE TRUNK SAID COME IN AND CHEE CHEE VERY PROUDLY TOOK THE ANIMAL INSIDE AND SHOWED HIM TO THE DOCTOR WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT ASKED JOHN DOLITTLE GAZING AT THE STRANGE CREATURE
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE I AM SURE BUT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN ASLEEP IN BED WHEN I AM UP MADDENS ME IT SEEMS TO ME SO SHOCKING TO SEE THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A MAN'S LIFE THE PRICELESS MOMENTS THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HIM AGAIN
WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
NERVELESS HAND NERVOUS SOLICITUDE NETTLED OPPONENT NEUTRAL EYE NEW PERPLEXITIES
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
AND THE MONKEYS TELL ME THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT IF I DO NOT LIKE IT IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN YOU WILL SEND ME BACK WHY CERTAINLY OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR
SHORT NOTICE SOON PAST THE FINE WEATHER NEVER CAME THAT SUMMER I EXPECT THAT MACHINE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING THEN THERE ARE THOSE NEW STYLE OF BAROMETERS
THE MAN TOOK UP MY FEET ONE BY ONE AND EXAMINED THEM THEN STANDING UP AND DUSTING HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER HE SAID YOUR HORSE HAS GOT THE THRUSH AND BADLY TOO
WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
AND A COUPLE OF POUNDS OF GRAPES IN ANOTHER BAG AND A JAPANESE PAPER UMBRELLA AND A FRYING PAN WHICH BEING TOO LONG TO PACK WE HAD WRAPPED ROUND WITH BROWN PAPER IT DID LOOK A LOT
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
THIS OFTEN DISORDERED MY HEALTH AND MADE ME SOMETIMES HEAVY AND DULL BUT MORE OFTEN RESTLESS AND FEVERISH HE NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A MEAL OF GREEN FOOD OR A BRAN MASH WHICH WOULD HAVE COOLED ME
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GET UP AT SIX SO I DID I ANSWERED
WHEN THE DOCTOR STOPPED SPEAKING AND SAT DOWN ALL THE MONKEYS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS A LONG TIME AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET IT BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS AMONG OUR PEOPLE THAT HE SAT AND ATE WITH US HERE UNDER THE TREES
BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
NOMINAL ALLEGIANCE NONCHALANT MANNER NON COMMITTAL WAY NONDESCRIPT GARB NONSENSE RHYMES
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
WE CALMED THEM WITH AN UMBRELLA AND SAT DOWN TO CHOPS AND COLD BEEF HARRIS SAID THE GREAT THING IS TO MAKE A GOOD BREAKFAST AND HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF CHOPS SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE WHILE THEY WERE HOT
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD
THE PUSHMI PULLYU HEARD THEM COMING AND HE TRIED HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THE RING OF MONKEYS BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
EXCUSE ME SURELY YOU ARE RELATED TO THE DEER FAMILY ARE YOU NOT YES
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ON THIS LINE WE SAID WHAT YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SLIP OFF QUIETLY AND GO TO KINGSTON WELL I DON'T KNOW GENTS REPLIED THE NOBLE FELLOW
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
HARRIS AND I APPEARED TO BE STRUCK BY IT AT THE SAME INSTANT WE DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM AND IN THIS NOBLE RESOLVE OUR OWN DISPUTE WAS FORGOTTEN WE FLEW ACROSS AND SLUNG THE CLOTHES OFF HIM
SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE
IT WAS PROMPTLY CONCLUDED BY OUR STREET THAT BIGGS'S BOY FOR THAT PERIOD WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND HAD HE NOT BEEN ABLE
TAKE THE FUNNY LOOKING THING ALONG DO WELL PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MURMURED THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE A NICE NEW KIND OF PET BUT DOES THE ER
AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER
TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
THE TENTH CHAPTER THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALL PUSHMI PULLYUS ARE NOW EXTINCT THAT MEANS THERE AREN'T ANY MORE
FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MISTER WESTON LAST NIGHT AND AS FOR JAMES YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO RANDALLS BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA
HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN
IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY
YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER IT WAS VERY LUCKY FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN TO FILL THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN HIGHBURY THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN
THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU PAPA
WE MUST GO AND PAY WEDDING VISIT VERY SOON MY DEAR HOW AM I TO GET SO FAR RANDALLS IS SUCH A DISTANCE I COULD NOT WALK HALF SO FAR NO PAPA NOBODY THOUGHT OF YOUR WALKING WE MUST GO IN THE CARRIAGE TO BE SURE
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD OPEN HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS
HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER AFTER SOME DAYS ABSENCE
AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
THE CARRIAGE BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR SUCH A LITTLE WAY AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE ARE PAYING OUR VISIT THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MISTER WESTON'S STABLE PAPA YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED
HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISSUS WESTON ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WEDDING AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU FOR WE ALL BEHAVED CHARMINGLY EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS NOT A TEAR AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN
WHERE IS YOUR MERIT WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS AND THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER
LET EMMA HELP YOU TO A LITTLE BIT OF TART A VERY LITTLE BIT OURS ARE ALL APPLE TARTS YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF UNWHOLESOME PRESERVES HERE I DO NOT ADVISE THE CUSTARD MISSUS GODDARD WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF PAPA BUT I MUST INDEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER SUCH SUCCESS YOU KNOW
AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST
YOU KNOW I CANNOT MISTER WESTON IS SUCH A GOOD HUMOURED PLEASANT EXCELLENT MAN THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES A GOOD WIFE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR EVER AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT SHE IS A CIVIL PRETTY SPOKEN GIRL I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER WHENEVER I SEE HER SHE ALWAYS CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US
THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED
AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
IF YOU WILL COME I SHALL BE UNCOMMONLY GRATEFUL AND YOU AND I CAN HAVE A LITTLE CHAT BY OURSELVES IT WAS ONLY NEIGHBOURLY TO ACCEPT WHEN MISSUS STRICKLAND INTRODUCED ME TO HER HUSBAND HE GAVE ME A RATHER INDIFFERENT HAND TO SHAKE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND WAS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER AND YOU FELT SURE THAT SHE WAS AN ADMIRABLE MOTHER THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF HER SON AND DAUGHTER THE SON HIS NAME WAS ROBERT
WHICH TENDED TO HIGH HEELS AND PARIS FROCKS WORE A NEW HAT
THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO
IN POINT OF FACT HE WAS BROAD AND HEAVY WITH LARGE HANDS AND FEET AND HE WORE HIS EVENING CLOTHES CLUMSILY HE GAVE YOU SOMEWHAT THE IDEA OF A COACHMAN DRESSED UP FOR THE OCCASION HE WAS A MAN OF FORTY
THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
I FELT THEY EXPECTED ME TO SAY CLEVER THINGS AND I NEVER COULD THINK OF ANY TILL AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER I TRIED TO CONCEAL MY EMBARRASSMENT BY HANDING ROUND CUPS OF TEA AND RATHER ILL CUT BREAD AND BUTTER
WITH JUST SUCH SCORN AND THEY FORESEE THAT THESE BRAVE TORCH BEARERS WILL PRESENTLY YIELD THEIR PLACE ALSO THERE IS NO LAST WORD
I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
THERE AS IS NOTORIOUS HE SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND THERE I CAME ACROSS PERSONS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH HIM I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO THROW LIGHT ON JUST THAT PART OF HIS TRAGIC CAREER
I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING
SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
I LIVED NEAR VICTORIA STATION AND I RECALL LONG EXCURSIONS BY BUS TO THE HOSPITABLE HOUSES OF THE LITERARY IN MY TIMIDITY I WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE STREET WHILE I SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO RING THE BELL AND THEN
WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION
MISSUS JAY AWARE THAT IMPROPRIETY IS THE SOUL OF WIT MADE OBSERVATIONS IN TONES HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER THAT
WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED WAITING FOR DINNER TO BE ANNOUNCED I REFLECTED WHILE I CHATTED WITH THE WOMAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE IN THAT CIVILISED MAN PRACTISES A STRANGE INGENUITY
SHE HESITATED A LITTLE HER EYES GREW TENDER HE DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE A GENIUS HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT HE'S AWFULLY GOOD AND KIND
SO THAT THEY MAY EXERCISE THEIR DEXTERITY IT GUSHES FORTH LIKE AN OIL WELL AND THE SYMPATHETIC POUR OUT THEIR SYMPATHY WITH AN ABANDON THAT IS SOMETIMES EMBARRASSING TO THEIR VICTIMS
IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
AND DULL WHEN WE LEFT I WALKED AWAY WITH MISS WATERFORD AND THE FINE DAY AND HER NEW HAT PERSUADED US TO SAUNTER THROUGH THE PARK
PERHAPS HER NAIVETE WAS HER GREATEST CHARM YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AT ALL LITERARY SHE SAID HE'S A PERFECT PHILISTINE
IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME
HE WROTE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS THEN CAME THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AND THE POETS SANG NEW SONGS
IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD BEEN INVITED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE PARTY WAS PORTENTOUS THE WOMEN WERE TOO NICE TO BE WELL DRESSED AND TOO SURE OF THEIR POSITION TO BE AMUSING
WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
THE FATE WHICH AWAITS THEM WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT ANY BOOK WILL MAKE ITS WAY AMONG THAT MULTITUDE AND THE SUCCESSFUL BOOKS ARE BUT THE SUCCESSES OF A SEASON HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PAINS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN AT
STRICKLAND GAVE THE POLITE LITTLE LAUGH WITH WHICH PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE A FACETIOUSNESS IN WHICH THEY SEE NOTHING FUNNY BUT DID NOT SPEAK NEW ARRIVALS CLAIMED MY HOST'S ATTENTION AND I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO
I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY RETORT TO THIS SO I ASKED IF MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD CHILDREN YES SHE HAS A BOY AND A GIRL THEY'RE BOTH AT SCHOOL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED AND WE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS
HE WAS A FAMOUS POET IN HIS DAY AND THE WORLD RECOGNISED HIS GENIUS WITH A UNANIMITY WHICH THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF MODERN LIFE HAS RENDERED INFREQUENT HE HAD LEARNT HIS CRAFT AT THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDER POPE AND
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEVER SETTLED DOWN SO COMFORTABLY AS WHEN IT TURNED TO THE DETAILS OF THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ART WE PRACTISED
THESE A MAN CAN DO WITHOUT HE HAD NO ECCENTRICITY EVEN
BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL CONVERSATION EACH ONE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT DURING THE SOUP FISH AND ENTREE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE LEFT DURING THE ROAST SWEET AND SAVOURY
MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I HAVE READ DESULTORILY THE WRITINGS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT MAY BE THAT AMONG THEM A MORE FERVID KEATS A MORE ETHEREAL SHELLEY
I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND FELT A CERTAIN EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT HIM HE WAS SCARCELY A CREDIT TO A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF A POSITION IN THE WORLD OF ART AND LETTERS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NO SOCIAL GIFTS BUT
BUT THE ODES OF KEATS AND OF WORDSWORTH A POEM OR TWO BY COLERIDGE A FEW MORE BY SHELLEY DISCOVERED VAST REALMS OF THE SPIRIT THAT NONE HAD EXPLORED BEFORE MISTER CRABBE WAS AS DEAD AS MUTTON BUT
THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE
ROSE WATERFORD CAST DOWN HER EYES DEMURELY TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER REPLY SHE GIVES LUNCHEON PARTIES
I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIRTY SEVEN RATHER TALL AND PLUMP WITHOUT BEING FAT
IF THE NOVELS THAT DESCRIBE ITS PRESENT SINGULARITIES ARE ACCURATE
DURING THE SUMMER I MET MISSUS STRICKLAND NOT INFREQUENTLY I WENT NOW AND THEN TO PLEASANT LITTLE LUNCHEONS AT HER FLAT AND TO RATHER MORE FORMIDABLE TEA PARTIES WE TOOK A FANCY TO ONE ANOTHER
TO MY MIND THEY KNOW TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT STOMACH THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THEY SLAP ME ON THE BACK OR THE EMOTION WITH WHICH THEY HURL THEMSELVES ON MY BOSOM
AND ENTERTAINED WITH PROPER LAVISHNESS SHE HELD THEIR WEAKNESS FOR LIONS IN GOOD HUMOURED CONTEMPT BUT PLAYED TO THEM HER PART OF THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN OF LETTERS WITH DECORUM
CAN HARDLY BE SUPERFLUOUS WHAT WOULD WE NOT GIVE FOR THE REMINISCENCES OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH EL GRECO AS I WAS WITH STRICKLAND
FAILURE OR SUCCESS NOW THE WAR HAS COME
THE DAUGHTER WAS FOURTEEN HER HAIR THICK AND DARK LIKE HER MOTHER'S FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS IN FINE PROFUSION AND SHE HAD THE SAME KINDLY EXPRESSION AND SEDATE UNTROUBLED EYES
AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WAS IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH ME EXAMINED STRICKLAND AT MY EASE HE WAS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD IMAGINED HIM SLENDER AND OF INSIGNIFICANT APPEARANCE
STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT
IT WAS AT HER HOUSE ONE DAY THAT I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND'S WIFE MISS WATERFORD WAS GIVING A TEA PARTY AND HER SMALL ROOM WAS MORE THAN USUALLY FULL EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE TALKING AND I SITTING IN SILENCE FELT AWKWARD BUT
ROSE WATERFORD HAD A BLISTERING TONGUE NO ONE COULD SAY SUCH BITTER THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND NO ONE COULD DO MORE CHARMING ONES THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I LIKED IN MISSUS STRICKLAND
AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE
MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS
ROSE WATERFORD WAS A CYNIC SHE LOOKED UPON LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING NOVELS AND THE PUBLIC AS HER RAW MATERIAL NOW AND THEN SHE INVITED MEMBERS OF IT TO HER HOUSE IF THEY SHOWED AN APPRECIATION OF HER TALENT
THEN WE WOULD SPEAK OF THIS PUBLISHER AND OF THAT COMPARING THE GENEROSITY OF ONE WITH THE MEANNESS OF ANOTHER WE WOULD ARGUE WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO GO TO ONE WHO GAVE HANDSOME ROYALTIES
HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER
THE DINING ROOM WAS INCONVENIENTLY CROWDED THERE WAS A K C AND HIS WIFE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COLONEL MAC ANDREW AND THE WIFE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
I WAS LED UP TO MISSUS STRICKLAND AND FOR TEN MINUTES WE TALKED TOGETHER I NOTICED NOTHING ABOUT HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE SHE HAD A FLAT IN WESTMINSTER OVERLOOKING THE UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL AND
YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME TILL THIS MOMENT OH AS TO THAT ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW
OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION OF ITS HAVING FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION
EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL TO SEE AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE OR THE CLOISTERS OF THE OTHER HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH
TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD LED CATHERINE'S FEELINGS THROUGH THE VARIETIES OF SUSPENSE SECURITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE NOW SAFELY LODGED IN PERFECT BLISS AND WITH SPIRITS ELATED TO RAPTURE WITH HENRY AT HER HEART
WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
HER VOICE FALTERED AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME HIS UNLOOKED FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE CATHERINE'S HEART SINK
ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS
THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY
WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER
WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW
HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT
SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED
A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE SOME OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH
WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE
SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT IGNORANCE
I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE
IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING THE VERY DOORWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY
IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY
GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET
TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY
AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS
SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS
THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE WISHES TO STAND BY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY YOU KNOW ONE MAY NOT MEAN THE NEXT
TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY
IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING
SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
THE GENERAL WILL SEND A SERVANT WITH ME I DARE SAY HALF THE WAY AND THEN I SHALL SOON BE AT SALISBURY AND THEN I AM ONLY NINE MILES FROM HOME AH CATHERINE WERE IT SETTLED SO IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS INTOLERABLE
TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED
ALL THAT I KNOW ALL THAT I ANSWER FOR IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE HE CERTAINLY IS GREATLY VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM MORE SO HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY
I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS
SO SOON AS MONDAY AND YOU ALL GO WELL I AM CERTAIN OF I SHALL BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE HOWEVER I NEED NOT GO TILL JUST BEFORE YOU DO YOU KNOW
HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL
PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MISTER THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST SIR AS YOU CAME IN WELL PROCEED BY ALL MEANS I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT
AND BELIEVING SO FAR HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A NOTION
WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY
BUT WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME SO SOON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICULARS
YES SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE DOOR WAS TOWARDS THE ROAD BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF MY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE YOU BROUGHT ME INTO THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD I REMEMBER YES MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO
BUT AS HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN POETICAL IDEAS HE HAD GONE INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS TALKING WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI ON THE PROJECTED RAILWAY FROM LEGHORN TO FLORENCE MONTE CRISTO SEEMED IN DESPAIR
THE REPAST WAS MAGNIFICENT MONTE CRISTO HAD ENDEAVORED COMPLETELY TO OVERTURN THE PARISIAN IDEAS
DEAR MAXIMILIAN WHY NOT ATTRIBUTE YOUR ESCAPE TO MY CONSTANT PRAYERS FOR YOUR SAFETY WHEN YOU ARE AWAY I NO LONGER PRAY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU YES SINCE YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SAID MORREL SMILING
MADAME DANGLARS FELL INTO A LONG SEAT PLACED NEAR THE CHIMNEY OH SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT SMILING ARE YOU COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN UPON THE VERY SEAT PERHAPS UPON WHICH THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED MADAME DANGLARS ROSE SUDDENLY
HAS PURPOSELY ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET M AND MADAME DE VILLEFORT AND SOMETIMES I CONFESS I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO TRY TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET OF OUR LOVE MY GOOD FRIEND SAID VALENTINE
IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT
YES BEFORE WITNESSES OH THIS IS VERY INTERESTING SAID DEBRAY IF THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A CRIME WE WILL INVESTIGATE IT THERE HAS BEEN A CRIME SAID MONTE CRISTO COME THIS WAY GENTLEMEN
AND ON MY HONOR WITHOUT AT ALL WISHING TO DEPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN CAN REALLY LOVE HER THE FACT IS MAXIMILIAN
ON THE COUNT'S INVITATION OFFERED HIS ARM
NO NO SHE ANSWERED I WOULD RATHER REMAIN HERE ARE YOU REALLY FRIGHTENED MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO OH NO SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS BUT YOU SUPPOSE SCENES IN A MANNER WHICH GIVES THEM THE APPEARANCE OF REALITY
UTTERED A GROAN AND FAINTED
FOR THE BEAUTY OF EITHER IS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY WE SEEK IT IS YOUR LOVE WHICH MAKES YOU LOOK UPON EVERYTHING IN THAT LIGHT NO VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I WAS OBSERVING YOU BOTH WHEN YOU WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN
HOWEVER I HAVE MANAGED TO LIVE THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT THIS PROTECTION YOU WILL SAY BUT I WILL ENDEAVOR A LITTLE TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING HE INVITED ME TO DINE WITH HIM ON SATURDAY WHICH WAS A VERY NATURAL THING FOR HIM TO DO WELL WHAT HAVE I LEARNED SINCE
BUT COULD YOU NOT COMPROMISE MATTERS AND GIVE UP A PORTION OF YOUR FORTUNE TO HER SON HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A PROPOSITION ESPECIALLY TO A WOMAN WHO ALWAYS PROFESSES TO BE SO ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED VALENTINE
WERE ALREADY SCATTERED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HOUSE FOR THEY THOUGHT THE VISIT WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO THE ONE ROOM AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WOULD OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE REST OF THE BUILDING OF WHICH MONTE CRISTO HAD CREATED A PALACE EACH ONE WENT OUT BY THE OPEN DOORS
MUST FIND FAR TOO LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN A COMMON EVERY DAY SORT OF ATTACHMENT SUCH AS OURS BUT THEY ARE CALLING ME DO YOU HEAR AH VALENTINE SAID MAXIMILIAN GIVE ME BUT ONE FINGER THROUGH THIS OPENING IN THE GRATING ONE FINGER
IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED A LUXURY TO HAVE THEM ALIVE IT BEING AN AMUSING SIGHT TO SEE THEM DIE FOR WHEN DYING THEY CHANGE COLOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND LIKE THE RAINBOW WHEN IT DISAPPEARS PASS THROUGH ALL THE PRISMATIC SHADES AFTER WHICH THEY WERE SENT TO THE KITCHEN
I RECOLLECT COMING FOR MY MOTHER TO LOOK AT IT WHEN M DE SAINT MERAN ADVERTISED IT FOR SALE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
NAY FURTHER HAVE YOU NEVER ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE TIME PLACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND FAILING IN THIS ATTEMPT HAVE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOUR SPIRITS MUST HAVE HELD CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME STATE OF BEING ANTERIOR TO THE PRESENT
AND THEN YOU KNOW HE SAID AN IDEA A SUPPOSITION IS SUFFICIENT WELL SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU MAY BELIEVE ME IF YOU LIKE BUT IT IS MY OPINION THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN THIS HOUSE TAKE CARE SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE KING'S ATTORNEY IS HERE
AND OPENS HIS HAND IN WHICH HE IS SURE TO FIND SOME DELIGHTFUL PRESENT M DE MONTE CRISTO APPEARS TO EXERT A MYSTERIOUS AND ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE INFLUENCE OVER ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY IF SUCH BE THE CASE MY DEAR VALENTINE
YOU SEE IT IS NOT MY FAULT AND MAXIMILIAN WAS PATIENT AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN MENTALLY CONTRASTING THE TWO GIRLS ONE FAIR WITH SOFT LANGUISHING EYES A FIGURE GRACEFULLY BENDING LIKE A WEEPING WILLOW
MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF A FRIEND AND REVEAL TO HIM THE LOVE I BEAR YOU VALENTINE STARTED A FRIEND MAXIMILIAN AND WHO IS THIS FRIEND I TREMBLE TO GIVE MY PERMISSION
AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS
BUT CERTAINLY EVERYTHING APPEARS TO ME BLACK IN THIS HOUSE SAID DEBRAY EVER SINCE VALENTINE'S DOWRY HAD BEEN MENTIONED MORREL HAD BEEN SILENT AND SAD CAN YOU IMAGINE SAID MONTE CRISTO
AND THEN WE WILL TAKE COFFEE IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER THE PLAY MONTE CRISTO LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS GUESTS
MONTE CRISTO DID THE SAME AND THE REST FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE
THE OTHER FIVE LEAGUES FROM NAPLES IS IT NOT AMUSING TO SEE THEM BOTH ON THE SAME TABLE WHAT ARE THE TWO FISH ASKED DANGLARS
HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED
BUT I FEEL AS IF MY GRANDFATHER'S LOOK AT THAT MOMENT WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ALL
AH MADAME CRIED DEBRAY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HOW PALE YOU LOOK IT IS VERY EVIDENT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT M DE MONTE CRISTO IS RELATING HORRIBLE STORIES TO US DOUBTLESS INTENDING TO FRIGHTEN US TO DEATH
THE LITTLEST FINGER OF ALL THAT I MAY HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING IT MAXIMILIAN WE SAID WE WOULD BE TO EACH OTHER AS TWO VOICES TWO SHADOWS AS YOU WILL VALENTINE SHALL YOU BE HAPPY IF I DO WHAT YOU WISH OH YES
WELL MY MAN DIGGING FOUND A BOX OR RATHER THE IRON WORK OF A BOX IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WAS THE SKELETON OF A NEWLY BORN INFANT MONTE CRISTO FELT THE ARM OF MADAME DANGLARS STIFFEN WHILE THAT OF VILLEFORT TREMBLED
AND THOSE TWO CRAYON PORTRAITS THAT HAVE FADED FROM THE DAMPNESS DO THEY NOT SEEM TO SAY WITH THEIR PALE LIPS AND STARING EYES WE HAVE SEEN VILLEFORT BECAME LIVID
AH HOW GOOD YOU ARE TO SAY SO VALENTINE YOU POSSESS A QUALITY WHICH CAN NEVER BELONG TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS IT IS THAT INDEFINABLE CHARM WHICH IS TO A WOMAN WHAT PERFUME IS TO THE FLOWER AND FLAVOR TO THE FRUIT
WHAT IS IT THAT WE REALLY DESIRE THAT WHICH WE CANNOT OBTAIN NOW TO SEE THINGS WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND TO PROCURE IMPOSSIBILITIES THESE ARE THE STUDY OF MY LIFE I GRATIFY MY WISHES BY TWO MEANS
SOMETHING IN FACT MORE THAN IS APPARENT ON A CASUAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT I BELIEVE THAT THIS SINGULAR MAN WHO APPEARS TO FATHOM THE MOTIVES OF EVERY ONE
SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART
I TOLD YOU I WAS NOT ON TERMS OF STRICT INTIMACY WITH EUGENIE YES BUT GIRLS TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT BEING PARTICULARLY INTIMATE OWN NOW THAT YOU DID QUESTION HER ON THE SUBJECT AH I SEE YOU ARE SMILING
AND THAT THEIR EXTERIORS CARRIED THE IMPRESS OF THEIR CHARACTERS THIS HOUSE WAS GLOOMY BECAUSE IT WAS REMORSEFUL IT WAS REMORSEFUL BECAUSE IT CONCEALED A CRIME
AS I RODE BY THE COUNT'S HOUSE I PERCEIVED A LIGHT IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND FANCIED I SAW THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAIN NOW VALENTINE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HE KNEW OF MY WISH TO POSSESS THIS HORSE
IN HIS MOST SIMPLE ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HIS MOST SECRET THOUGHTS I FIND A RELATION TO MY OWN
AND MAXIMILIAN UNDERSTOOD THAT MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS VISIT HAD AT LAST COME TO AN END IN A FEW MINUTES VALENTINE RE ENTERED THE GARDEN ALONE FOR FEAR THAT ANY ONE SHOULD BE OBSERVING HER RETURN SHE WALKED SLOWLY
WE HAVE AT PISA UGOLINO'S TOWER AT FERRARA TASSO'S PRISON AT RIMINI THE ROOM OF FRANCESCA AND PAOLO YES BUT YOU HAVE NOT THIS LITTLE STAIRCASE SAID MONTE CRISTO OPENING A DOOR CONCEALED BY THE DRAPERY
HE APPEARS RATHER TO AVOID ME AH HE IS NOT GENEROUS NEITHER DOES HE POSSESS THAT SUPERNATURAL PENETRATION WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM FOR IF HE DID HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IF HE HAD BEEN GENEROUS SEEING ME SAD AND SOLITARY
THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULAR ABOUT IT EXCEPTING THAT ALTHOUGH DAYLIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED IT WAS NOT LIGHTED AND EVERYTHING IN IT WAS OLD FASHIONED WHILE THE REST OF THE ROOMS HAD BEEN REDECORATED THESE TWO CAUSES WERE ENOUGH TO GIVE IT A GLOOMY ASPECT
HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN
WOULD HAVE ALARMED THEM MUCH MORE THAN A VISIT TO THE ROOM THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THEY BEGAN BY WALKING THROUGH THE APARTMENTS MANY OF WHICH WERE FITTED UP IN THE EASTERN STYLE WITH CUSHIONS AND DIVANS INSTEAD OF BEDS AND PIPES INSTEAD OF FURNITURE
I HAVE DONE WRONG FOR I HAVE GIVEN UTTERANCE TO THOUGHTS CONCERNING THAT MAN WHICH I DID NOT EVEN KNOW EXISTED IN MY HEART I DO NOT DENY THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK OR THAT I HAVE NOT MYSELF EXPERIENCED IT
OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
WELL WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY VALENTINE SO LONG AS I AM SATISFIED AND FEEL THAT EVEN THIS LONG AND PAINFUL SUSPENSE IS AMPLY REPAID BY FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR SOCIETY OR TWO WORDS FROM YOUR LIPS
MERELY BECAUSE ONE MIGHT HAVE DIED CARELESSLY ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO YOU ARE CERTAINLY AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN SAID DANGLARS AND PHILOSOPHERS MAY WELL SAY IT IS A FINE THING TO BE RICH AND TO HAVE IDEAS ADDED MADAME DANGLARS
FOR A DECLARATION TO BE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES HE THEN TOOK VILLEFORT'S ARM
AND THAT MYSTERIOUS STAIRCASE THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH NOT TO DISTURB THEIR SLEEP THE DOCTOR AND NURSE PASS OR EVEN THE FATHER CARRYING THE SLEEPING CHILD
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MEREST CHANCE IN THIS MEETING PRAY REFLECT A LITTLE MY FATHER WHO NEVER GOES OUT HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ON THE POINT OF REFUSING THIS INVITATION MADAME DE VILLEFORT ON THE CONTRARY
WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
TO GO INSTANTLY TO GENEVA COME WITH ME HENRY TO ORDER THE HORSES DURING OUR WALK CLERVAL ENDEAVOURED TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATION HE COULD ONLY EXPRESS HIS HEARTFELT SYMPATHY POOR WILLIAM SAID HE DEAR LOVELY CHILD
HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER THE SERVANT INSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITION JUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED
SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF
THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACH RAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITS PROGRESS IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAIN COMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED
BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE
NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL
A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HER COUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED SURPRISE
WHO COULD ATTEMPT TO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THE WINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAIN STREAM WITH A STRAW
AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM
MY DEAR VICTOR YOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OF YOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEW LINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU
ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE
YOUR DISASTER IS IRREPARABLE
THE POOR VICTIM WHO ON THE MORROW WAS TO PASS THE AWFUL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FELT NOT AS I DID SUCH DEEP AND BITTER AGONY I GNASHED MY TEETH AND GROUND THEM TOGETHER
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
A HILL THAT BOUNDS PLAINPALAIS ON THE SOUTH HE SOON REACHED THE SUMMIT AND DISAPPEARED I REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE THUNDER CEASED
YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE
SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD
SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
I WANDERED ON WITH A HASTY STEP THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MY HANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL
GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME
ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOT CONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE
BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT
FAREWELL SWEET LADY DEAREST ELIZABETH MY BELOVED AND ONLY FRIEND MAY HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY BLESS AND PRESERVE YOU MAY THIS BE THE LAST MISFORTUNE THAT YOU WILL EVER SUFFER LIVE AND BE HAPPY
TO SHED COUNTLESS TEARS HAPPY BEYOND HIS HOPES IF THUS INEXORABLE FATE BE SATISFIED AND IF THE DESTRUCTION PAUSE BEFORE THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE HAVE SUCCEEDED TO YOUR SAD TORMENTS
FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL DO NOT FEAR I WILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE I WILL MELT THE STONY HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
VICTOR HE IS MURDERED I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE YOU BUT WILL SIMPLY RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSACTION LAST THURSDAY MAY SEVENTH I MY NIECE AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS WENT TO WALK IN PLAINPALAIS
WHEN ELIZABETH CONJECTURED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE HE WAS NOT THERE WE RETURNED AGAIN WITH TORCHES FOR I COULD NOT REST WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY SWEET BOY HAD LOST HIMSELF AND WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE DAMPS AND DEWS OF NIGHT
JUSTINE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW WHO IT WAS SHE APPROACHED ME AND SAID DEAR SIR
AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME
OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THE JEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOON I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FOR HOPE
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME
CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT
THUS SPOKE MY PROPHETIC SOUL AS TORN BY REMORSE HORROR AND DESPAIR I BEHELD THOSE I LOVED SPEND VAIN SORROW UPON THE GRAVES OF WILLIAM AND JUSTINE
ONE ONLY CONSOLATION HAVE WE HIS FRIENDS MOURN AND WEEP BUT HE IS AT REST THE PANG IS OVER HIS SUFFERINGS ARE AT AN END FOR EVER A SOD COVERS HIS GENTLE FORM AND HE KNOWS NO PAIN HE CAN NO LONGER BE A SUBJECT FOR PITY
ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING
AND YET SHE HAS COMMITTED A MURDER SOON AFTER WE HEARD THAT THE POOR VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE MY COUSIN MY FATHER WISHED HER NOT TO GO BUT SAID THAT HE LEFT IT TO HER OWN JUDGMENT AND FEELINGS TO DECIDE
SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER
THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK
HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS
AND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSED AVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMAN BUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM SHE PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD
IN AN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVE AND I THE CAUSE A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD I HAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE BUT I WAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN
I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD
WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRST EXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS
THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD
JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY
SO WHAT MATTERS AFTER ALL WE RESERVE THE RIGHT HOWEVER TO DO HOMAGE TO THE QUEEN WHO RULES OVER THESE WISE OLD HILLS I OFFER YOU THE HUMBLE SERVICES OF MYSELF AND MY COMPANIONS WE ARE YOURS TO COMMAND
PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ALONE YOU HAVE A RAGGED FOLLOWING YOUR HIGHNESS BUT IT SHALL BE A LOYAL ONE WILL YOU RE ENTER THE COACH IT IS NOT FAR TO THE PLACE I SPEAK OF AND I MYSELF WILL DRIVE YOU THERE COME
NOT I FAITH NO IF I READ ANY IT SHALL BE MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S HER NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH THEY ARE WORTH READING SOME FUN AND NATURE IN THEM UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE
CALLING OUT TO HIS COMPANIONS IN A LANGUAGE STRANGE TO BEVERLY HE CRACKED THE WHIP AND ONCE MORE THEY WERE LUMBERING OVER THE WRETCHED ROAD BEVERLY SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WITH A DEEP SIGH OF RESIGNATION WELL I'M IN FOR IT SHE THOUGHT
WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS
YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T HURT HER COMPOSE YOURSELF SHE IS SAFE SAID THE LEADER BY THIS TIME IT WAS QUITE DARK AT A WORD FROM HIM TWO OR THREE MEN LIGHTED LANTERNS THE PICTURE WAS MORE WEIRD THAN EVER IN THE FITFUL GLOW
CRIED SHE NOW ABLE TO THINK MORE CLEARLY AND YOU ARE MILES FROM AN INN OR HOUSE OF ANY KIND HE WENT ON
AND THIS ADDRESS
YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE
WHY SHE'S A NEGRESS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A COLORED PERSON IS YOU MEAN SHE IS A SLAVE A BLACK SLAVE WE DON'T OWN SLAVES ANY MO' MORE HE LOOKED MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
IS YO DAID YIT MISS BEV'LY IS DE END CAME MOANED AUNT FANNY BEVERLY COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE I AM QUITE ALIVE AUNTIE THESE MEN WILL NOT HURT US THEY ARE VERY NICE GENTLEMEN
YOU DO US A GRAVE INJUSTICE IT'S VERY STRANGE MUTTERED BEVERLY SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK
HE WAS DELIBERATELY TAKING HER FARTHER INTO THE MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES HIS PURPOSE KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF A HUNDRED TERRORS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HER
THE ONLY REWARD I CAN ASK IS FORGIVENESS FOR TRESPASSING UPON THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS YOU SHALL RECEIVE PARDON FOR ALL TRANSGRESSIONS BUT YOU MUST GET ME TO SOME PLACE OF SAFETY SAID BEVERLY EAGERLY AND QUICKLY TOO YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE ADDED
COMPELLING HER TO TRAVEL FOR MANY MILES BY STAGE AND THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CONFUSING HER IN SOME STRANGE WAY WITH THE PRINCESS YETIVE THE NEWS HAD EVIDENTLY SPED THROUGH AXPHAIN AND THE HILLS WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF FIRE
UNCONSCIOUSLY THIS SLIM SPRIG OF SOUTHERN VALOR THREW BACK HER SHOULDERS AND LIFTED HER CHIN IF THEY WERE BRIGANDS THEY SHOULD NOT FIND HER A CRINGING COWARD AFTER ALL SHE WAS A CALHOUN
HE WORE THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN TRAPPED AND SEEKING MEANS OF ESCAPE SUDDENLY HE DARTED BEHIND THE COACH ALMOST BRUSHING AGAINST BEVERLY'S HAT AS HE PASSED THE WINDOW SHE OPENED HER LIPS TO CALL TO HIM BUT EVEN AS SHE DID SO HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS
NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY
BUT I CHANCED TO MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD LAST TERM AH THORPE SAID HE DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS THIS IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE
OH MOANED BEVERLY SUDDENLY LEANING AGAINST THE FORE WHEEL HER EYES ALMOST STARTING FROM HER HEAD THE LEADER LAUGHED QUIETLY YES GOOD NATUREDLY OH YOU WON'T
SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS THAT
IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
AND THE MOANING OF THE OLD NEGRESS BEVERLY REALIZED WITH A SINKING HEART THAT THEY WERE ALONE AND HELPLESS IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH NIGHT UPON THEM SHE NEVER KNEW WHERE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE CAME FROM
WITH ITS GALLANT SMILE AND OMINOUS PATCH SHE HESITATED FEAR ENTERING HER SOUL ONCE MORE
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
EXPECTING THE MURDEROUS BLADE OF THE DRIVER TO MEET HER AS SHE DID SO PAULOFF HAD SWUNG FROM THE BOX OF THE COACH AND WAS PEERING FIRST INTO THE WOODLAND BELOW
IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER
IT REMAINED ONLY FOR HER TO IMPRESS UPON AUNT FANNY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WISE OLD HILLS THEY MUST BE SHE SAID WITH EVASIVE ENTHUSIASM YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I AM THE PRINCESS SHE WENT ON
AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE
AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK
YOUR ESCORT HAS FLED AS THOUGH PURSUED BY SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SHADOWS YOUR DRIVER HAS DESERTED YOUR HORSES ARE HALF DEAD YOU ARE INDEED AS YOU HAVE SAID POWERLESS AND YOU ARE BESIDES ALL THESE
THE TEARS WERE WELLING TO HER EYES
WE HAVE ONLY THE BEST OF MOTIVES IN MIND TRUE THE HILLS ARE FULL OF LAWLESS FELLOWS AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO FIGHT THEM ALMOST DAILY BUT YOU HAVE FALLEN IN WITH HONEST MEN VERY NICE GENTLEMEN I TRUST LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO WE PUT A BAND OF ROBBERS TO FLIGHT
SHE UTTERED THE LAST OBSERVATION IN A LOUD VOICE AND IT HAD ITS EFFECT FOR THE LEADER CAME TO HER SIDE WITH LONG STRIDES CONVINCE YOUR SERVANT THAT WE MEAN NO HARM YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID EAGERLY A NEW DEFERENCE IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER
MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF
COVERING HIS PATCH CAREFULLY WITH HIS SLOUCHING HAT MY SERVANT SHE'S COLORED COLORED HE ASKED IN AMAZEMENT
AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF JOHN THORPE WHO IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSES SOON JOINED THEM AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS WHICH WERE HER DUE
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
SUCH AS REPELLING BRIGANDS WHO SUDDENLY APPEAR UPON THE SCENE YES MAY I ASK WHY YOU DID NOT USE IT THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LOCKED UP IN ONE OF MY BAGS I DON'T KNOW JUST WHICH ONE AND AUNT FANNY HAS THE KEY
HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES
IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DENY THE STORY THESE MEN WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER IN A FLASH
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT
FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE HAND OF ISABELLA ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM
HE CRIED WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND TOWARD HIS COMPANIONS BEVERLY LOOKED DUBIOUS
WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE
AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
AND SAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT A THOUGHT FOR THE VICTIMS INSIDE STOP TURN AROUND SHE CRIED IN A FRENZY
CONFESSED BEVERLY THE CHIEF OF THE HONEST MEN LAUGHED AGAIN A CLEAR RINGING LAUGH THAT BESPOKE SUPREME CONFIDENCE IN HIS RIGHT TO ENJOY HIMSELF AND WHO IS AUNT FANNY HE ASKED
IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE
THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
FORTY AYE FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE WELL I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN TOMORROW MIND I AM ENGAGED HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT WILL BE CRIED ISABELLA TURNING ROUND MY DEAREST CATHERINE I QUITE ENVY YOU
BEVERLY CALHOUN SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WEAK AND TERROR STRICKEN IT WAS PLAIN TO HER THAT THE HORSES WERE NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR THE MAN HAD BEEN LASHING THEM FURIOUSLY THERE WAS BUT ONE CONCLUSION
ASKED THE LEADER PUTTING AWAY HIS BRIEF SHOW OF INDIGNATION
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO LOOKED AS THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COMPLETE OUTFIT OF WEARING APPAREL POOR WAYFARERS MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS REPLIED THE TALL VAGABOND BOWING LOW TO HER SURPRISE HE SPOKE IN VERY GOOD ENGLISH HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR
THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
BUT APART FROM THIS HER QUICK BRAIN WAS EVOLVING ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE ENDINGS NONE SHORT OF ABSOLUTE DISASTER EVEN AS SHE PRAYED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHECK THE MAD RUSH
AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE
SAID ALICE THE KING TURNED PALE AND SHUT HIS NOTE BOOK HASTILY CONSIDER YOUR VERDICT HE SAID TO THE JURY IN A LOW TREMBLING VOICE THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE TO COME YET PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE WHITE RABBIT JUMPING UP IN A GREAT HURRY
WHY CLIMB SAID HE WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO STOP UNLESS YOU DROP AND THE HIGHER YOU ARE THE WORSE YOU FLOP AND EVERY CRICKET THAT CHIRPS AT EVE AND SCOFFS AT THE FOLLY OF FOOLS WHO GRIEVE
HE KNOWS THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT YOU CAN NEVER MISTAKE THEM HE WILL SAY FOR THEY ALWAYS ACT IN A GLUGLIKE WAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE GLASS POINTS FAIR WITH CIRCUMSPECTION AND PROPER CARE
THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS DOWN ON THEIR SLATES WHEN THE WHITE RABBIT INTERRUPTED
HE TRUSTS TO YOU TO SET THEM FREE EXACTLY AS WE WERE MY NOTION WAS THAT YOU HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT AN OBSTACLE THAT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND IT
WHERE I'VE HEARD IT REPORTED LARGE PROFITS ARE MADE BESIDES HE CAN SELL US CHEAP BUTTONS AND BRAID SO POOR YOUNG SYM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL WHERE THE FIRST THING TAUGHT IS THE GOLDEN RULE DO UNTO OTHERS THE TEACHER SAID
THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD YOU MAY LOOK UP THE REST IN A BOOK SAID HE AT PRESENT IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO ME BUT DO IT WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE AND NOW SAID THE TEACHER THE DAY'S TASK BRINGS CONSIDERATION OF PRACTICAL THINGS
THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGHTS OF TRUTH OF GILDED BAUBLES AND THINGS WORTH WHILE AND HE SAID THERE IS MUCH THAT A GLUG SHOULD KNOW BUT HIS MIND IS CLOUDED HIS YEARS ARE FEW
AND THIS WAS HER DREAM FIRST SHE DREAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HERSELF AND ONCE AGAIN THE TINY HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON HER KNEE AND THE BRIGHT EAGER EYES WERE LOOKING UP INTO HERS SHE COULD HEAR THE VERY TONES OF HER VOICE
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
IF ANY ONE OF THEM CAN EXPLAIN IT SAID ALICE
SHOUTS OF ANGER AND WORDS OF SHAME AS GLUG BLAMED GLUG FOR HIS WOEFUL STATE THIS BLAME SAID SYM IS IT MORTAL'S RIGHT TO BLAME HIS FELLOW FOR AUGHT HE BE
AS SOON AS THE JURY HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING UPSET AND THEIR SLATES AND PENCILS HAD BEEN FOUND AND HANDED BACK TO THEM THEY SET TO WORK VERY DILIGENTLY TO WRITE OUT A HISTORY OF THE ACCIDENT ALL EXCEPT THE LIZARD
OR OUR INDUSTRIES SOON WILL BE GONE TO THE DOGS AND THE KING SAID BOSH YOU'RE UN GLUGGISH AND RUDE AND THE QUEEN SAID WHAT AN ABSURD ATTITUDE THEN THE GLUGS CRIED DOWN WITH POLITICAL QUACKS HOW DID OUR GRANDPAS LOOK AT A TAX SO THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO YOU GAVE US THREE OR MORE THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU THOUGH THEY WERE MINE BEFORE IF I OR SHE SHOULD CHANCE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
AH HE'S GETTING SENSE SAY THE ELDERLY FOLK BUT SYM
WHEN THE AUNT RECOVERED SHE SCREAMED A TRAMP A LOW LIVED PILFERING IDLE SCAMP WHO STEALS PEOPLE'S WASHING AND SLEEPS IN THE DAMP SHARP TO THE HOUR SYM WAS READY AND DRESSED YOUNG BIRDS SIGHED THE FATHER MUST GO FROM THE NEST
IN HIS VEINS RAN BLOOD OF THAT STUPID RACE OF DOCILE FOLK WHO INHABIT THE PLACE CALLED GOSH SAD GOSH WHERE THE TALL TREES SIGH
FOR ANY OLD GLUG IS LIKE THE REST AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THERE'S WEATHER ABOUT IN A GENERAL WAY AS A CURE FOR GOUT THO SOME FOLKS DOUBT IF THE CLIMBING HABIT IS GOOD FOR GOUT SO JOI WAS HANGED AND HIS RACE WAS RUN
SO THE GLUGS CONTINUED WITH GREED AND GLEE TO BUY CHEAP CLOTHING AND PILLS AND TEA TILL EVERY GLUG IN THE LAND OF GOSH OWNED THREE CLEAN SHIRTS AND A FOURTH IN THE WASH BUT THEY ALL GREW IDLE AND FOND OF EASE AND EASY TO SWINDLE AND HARD TO PLEASE
IF A MAN MAKES A PROFIT OF FIFTEEN POUNDS ON ONE WEEK'S TAKINGS FROM TWO MILK ROUNDS HOW MANY AND SYM WENT DREAMING AWAY TO THE SUNLIT LANDS WHERE THE FIELD MICE PLAY
WITH BUTTONS AND HOOKS AND MEDICAL BOOKS AND ROTARY ENGINES AND RUM LARGE CASES WITH LABELS OCCASIONAL TABLES HAIR TONIC AND FIDDLES AND PHONES AND THE GLUGS WHILE COPNCEALING THEIR JOY IN THE DEALING PAID PROMPTLY IN NOTHING BUT STONES
SO ALICE GOT UP AND RAN OFF THINKING WHILE SHE RAN AS WELL SHE MIGHT WHAT A WONDERFUL DREAM IT HAD BEEN BUT HER SISTER SAT STILL JUST AS SHE LEFT HER LEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND
TO SPURN THE LAW OF THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE AND END THE RULE OF THE GREAT KING SPLOSH WHO SHALL WARN THE GLUGS OF THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND AT LAST BRING PEACE SWEET PEACE TO GOSH
AND HIS PARENTS CLAIMS WERE A DEAL DENIED BY HIS MAIDEN AUNT ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
THAT SHE TIPPED OVER THE JURY BOX WITH THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT UPSETTING ALL THE JURYMEN ON TO THE HEADS OF THE CROWD BELOW AND THERE THEY LAY SPRAWLING ABOUT
THERE THEY ARE SAID THE KING TRIUMPHANTLY POINTING TO THE TARTS ON THE TABLE NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER THAN THAT THEN AGAIN
AND DARED TO MUSE ON THE ACTS OF SPLOSH
OH THE KING WAS RICH AND THE QUEEN WAS FAIR AND THEY MADE A VERY RESPECTABLE PAIR AND WHENEVER A GLUG IN THAT PEACEFUL LAND DID ANYTHING NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE HE LOOKED IN A BOOK AND CHARGED THAT GLUG WITH A CRIME CALLED CROOK
AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHER ABOUT HER OTHER LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT AND EAGER WITH MANY A STRANGE TALE PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE DREAM OF WONDERLAND OF LONG AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS
WELL I SHAN'T GO AT ANY RATE SAID ALICE BESIDES THAT'S NOT A REGULAR RULE YOU INVENTED IT JUST NOW IT'S THE OLDEST RULE IN THE BOOK SAID THE KING
PARENTAL BLITHER SHE SAID QUITE FLAT HE'S AN AVERAGE GLUG AND HE'S RED AND FAT AND EXCEEDINGLY FAT AND RED AT THAT BUT THE FATHER JOI WHEN HE GAZED ON SYM DREAMED GREAT AND WONDERFUL THINGS FOR HIM
AND THE OGS WENT HOME WITH THEIR LOADS OF STONES WHICH THEY LANDED WITH GLEE IN THE LAND OF PODGE DO YOU NOTICE THE DODGE NOT YET DID THE GLUGS NOR THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED LET THE JURY CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT THE KING SAID FOR ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY NO NO SAID THE QUEEN SENTENCE FIRST VERDICT AFTERWARDS
AND THAT'S THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT THE JURY ALL LOOKED PUZZLED HE MUST HAVE IMITATED SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND SAID THE KING THE JURY ALL BRIGHTENED UP AGAIN PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE KNAVE I DIDN'T WRITE IT AND THEY CAN'T PROVE I DID
THE KING HASTILY SAID AND WENT ON TO HIMSELF IN AN UNDERTONE IMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT IMPORTANT AS IF HE WERE TRYING WHICH WORD SOUNDED BEST SOME OF THE JURY WROTE IT DOWN IMPORTANT AND SOME UNIMPORTANT
AND LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THE QUESTING BOY SAID HE WHENEVER THE FIELDS ARE GREEN LIE STILL WHERE THE WILD ROSE FASHIONS A SCREEN
AND THERE CAME TO THE WONDERING MIND OF HIM LONG THOUGHTS OF THE RIDDLE THAT VEXES YOUTH AND FATHER HE SAID IN THE MART'S LOUD DIN IS THERE AUGHT OF PLEASURE DO SOME FIND JOY BUT HIS FATHER TILTED THE BEARDLESS CHIN
OH I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF GREAT DISMAY AND BEGAN PICKING THEM UP AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD FOR THE ACCIDENT OF THE GOLDFISH KEPT RUNNING IN HER HEAD AND SHE HAD A VAGUE SORT OF IDEA THAT THEY MUST BE COLLECTED AT ONCE AND PUT BACK INTO THE JURY BOX OR THEY WOULD DIE
THEN SPLOSH THE KING ROSE UP AND SAID IT'S NOT POLITE BUT HE'S SAFER DEAD AND THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE LAND OF GOSH FOR A GLUG NAMED JOI AND A KING CALLED SPLOSH AND EVERY GLUG FLUNG HIGH HIS HAT AND CRIED
KNOW OF THEIR FOLLY WHO FEAR TO DIE NEW INTEREST CAME TO THE MIND OF SYM AS MIDST HIS FELLOWS HE LIVED AND TOILED BUT THE WAYS OF THE GLUG FOLK PUZZLED HIM FOR SOME WON HONOUR WHILE SOME WERE FOILED
AND SEE THAT QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD TO KEEP BACK THE WANDERING HAIR THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HER EYES AND STILL AS SHE LISTENED OR SEEMED TO LISTEN THE WHOLE PLACE AROUND HER BECAME ALIVE WITH THE STRANGE CREATURES OF HER LITTLE SISTER'S DREAM
AND STOOPED TO A ROSE BUSH FLOWERING THERE SAID HE WHENEVER A BURSTING BLOOM LOOKS UP TO THE SUN MAY A SOUL FIND ROOM FOR A MEASURE OF AWE AT THE WONDROUS BIRTH OF ONE MORE TREASURE TO THIS GLAD EARTH SAID HE
FOR THAT GROCER OF OURS IN THE LIGHT BROWN HAT ASKS TWO AND ELEVEN FOR PICKLES LIKE THAT
FOUR SYM THE SON OF JOI NOW JOI THE REBEL HE HAD A SON IN FAR FAR GOSH WHERE THE TALL TREES WAVE SAID JOI
HE UNFOLDED THE PAPER AS HE SPOKE AND ADDED IT ISN'T A LETTER AFTER ALL IT'S A SET OF VERSES ARE THEY IN THE PRISONER'S HANDWRITING ASKED ANOTHER OF THE JURYMEN NO THEY'RE NOT SAID THE WHITE RABBIT
AND THE KING SAID HUM AND THE QUEEN SAID O O THAT CURTAIN WHAT A BEE OOTIFUL BLUE BUT A GLUG STOOD UP WITH SOME VERY LARGE EARS AND SAID
HER SISTER KISSED HER AND SAID IT WAS A CURIOUS DREAM DEAR CERTAINLY
SO SYM WENT OFF AND A YEAR RAN BY AND THE FATHER SAID WITH A SMILE MASKED SIGH IT IS MEET THAT THE YOUNG SHOULD LEAVE THE NEST SAID THE AUNT DON'T SPILL THAT SOUP ON YOUR VEST
LIE FLAT ON YOUR BACK ON THE GOOD GREEN EARTH AND ROAR TILL THE GREAT VAULT ECHOES YOUR MIRTH AS HE WALKED IN THE CITY TO SYM THERE CAME SOUNDS ENVENOMED WITH FEAR AND HATE
THESE WERE THE VERSES THE WHITE RABBIT READ THEY TOLD ME YOU HAD BEEN TO HER AND MENTIONED ME TO HIM SHE GAVE ME A GOOD CHARACTER BUT SAID I COULD NOT SWIM HE SENT THEM WORD I HAD NOT GONE WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
GODS OF THE GLOAMING WHO RIDE ON THE BREEZE STOOPING TO HEAFTEN THE BIRDS AND THE TREES BUT EACH DULL GLUG SITS DOWN BY HIS DOOR AND MUTTERS TIS WINDY AND NOTHING MORE LIKE THE LONG DEAD GLUGS IN THE DAYS OF YORE
THE STONES OF GOSH NOW HERE IS A TALE OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND A WONDERFUL TALE I WEEN OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND THEIR GREAT KING SPLOSH AND TUSH HIS VIRTUOUS QUEEN
BUT UNDER A HEDGE BY A FLOWERING PEACH A YOUTH WITH A LITTLE BLUE WREN HELD SPEECH WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND HIS FEET IN THE GRASS
DO WE BLAME THE NIGHT WHEN DARKNESS GATHERS AND NONE CAN SEE SAID HE WHENEVER THERE SPRINGS FROM EARTH A PLANT ALL CROOKED AND MARRED AT BIRTH SHALL WE UNLEARNED IN THE GARDENER'S SCHEME BLAME PLANT OR EARTH FOR THE FAULTS THAT SEEM
SAID HE WHENEVER THE WEST WIND STIRS AND BIRDS IN FEATHERS AND BEASTS IN FURS STEAL OUT TO DANCE IN THE GLADE LIE STILL
WHY SUNLIGHT AND WORMS SAID THE LITTLE BLUE WREN SIX THE END OF JOI THEY CLIMBED THE TREES
IN THE FOLLOWING SUMMER THE OGS CAME BACK WITH A CARGO OF EIGHT DAY CLOCKS AND HAND PAINTED SCREENS AND SEWING MACHINES AND MANGLES AND SCISSORS AND SOCKS AND THEY SAID FOR THESE EXCELLENT THINGS WE BRING WE ARE READY TO TAKE MORE STONES
ORDERING OFF HER UNFORTUNATE GUESTS TO EXECUTION ONCE MORE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE DUCHESS'S KNEE WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CRASHED AROUND IT ONCE MORE THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON THE SQUEAKING OF THE LIZARD'S SLATE PENCIL
NOR YET DID THE GLUGS IN THEIR DREAMIEST DREAMS
IF THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT SAID THE KING THAT SAVES A WORLD OF TROUBLE YOU KNOW AS WE NEEDN'T TRY TO FIND ANY AND YET I DON'T KNOW HE WENT ON SPREADING OUT THE VERSES ON HIS KNEE
HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH

HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
AT ALL EVENTS YOUNG MAN RELY UPON ONE WHO HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS AT COURT DO NOT LULL YOURSELF IN SECURITY OR YOU WILL BE LOST BUT ON THE CONTRARY AND IT IS I WHO SAY IT SEE ENEMIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS IF ANYONE SEEKS A QUARREL WITH YOU
AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
WHICH MAY BETRAY HIM WHO WEARS IT SELL THIS RING A RING WHICH COMES FROM MY SOVEREIGN NEVER SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN AT LEAST TURN THE GEM INSIDE YOU SILLY FELLOW FOR EVERYBODY MUST BE AWARE THAT A CADET FROM GASCONY
LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
THE TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN AND THE HUMILIATION OF HIS EMINENCE YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AS LONG AS I SHALL HAVE THE LUCK TO ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THEIR MAJESTIES EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME
OH THE WOMEN THE WOMEN CRIED THE OLD SOLDIER I KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROMANTIC IMAGINATION EVERYTHING THAT SAVORS OF MYSTERY CHARMS THEM SO YOU HAVE SEEN THE ARM THAT WAS ALL YOU WOULD MEET THE QUEEN AND SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE
HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
NO BUT THANKS TO THIS DIAMOND REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
ARE THERE NOT SOME LATIN VERSES UPON THAT SUBJECT STOP YES DOUBTLESS REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE REMARKED IT
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU MY DEAR HOST SO MUCH THE WORSE WHEN I AM HAPPY I WISH ALL THE WORLD TO BE SO BUT IT APPEARS THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THE YOUNG MAN DEPARTED LAUGHING AT THE JOKE WHICH HE THOUGHT HE ALONE COULD COMPREHEND AMUSE YOURSELF WELL REPLIED BONACIEUX
WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
AH THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING BUT PROMISE ME IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE KILLED TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL GO TOMORROW I PROMISE IT DO YOU NEED MONEY
IT IS WOMAN WHO HAS RUINED US STILL RUINS US AND WILL RUIN US AS LONG AS THE WORLD STANDS TAKE MY ADVICE AND SET OUT THIS EVENING
WE ARE GOING AGAIN IT APPEARS TO HAVE OUR HIDES PIERCED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MUSKETOON AND YOUR PISTOLS
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
THE DEVIL WHAT MUST I DO ABOVE ALL THINGS BE ALWAYS ON YOUR GUARD THE CARDINAL HAS A TENACIOUS MEMORY AND A LONG ARM YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL REPAY YOU BY SOME ILL TURN BUT OF WHAT SORT
EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
FAR FROM HERE OH LORD NO ABOUT FORTY LEAGUES ONLY
WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
SHALL I GIVE YOU COUNSEL GOOD COUNSEL THE COUNSEL OF A FRIEND
WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
WELL THEN OFF TO THE NEAREST GOLDSMITH'S AND SELL THAT DIAMOND FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE YOU CAN GET FROM HIM HOWEVER MUCH OF A JEW HE MAY BE HE WILL GIVE YOU AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED PISTOLES PISTOLES HAVE NO NAME YOUNG MAN AND THAT RING HAS A TERRIBLE ONE
AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
AS HE PASSED THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE TOOK A GLANCE IN TO THE STABLES THREE OF THE FOUR HORSES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
BRUSH OFF YOUR BOOTS YESTERDAY FROM THE PAVEMENT OF PARIS
I PREFER TRAVELING ALONE TO HAVING A COMPANION WHO ENTERTAINS THE LEAST FEAR
NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
BY THE BY YOU CAN BE SURE OF YOUR LACKEY MISTRUST EVERYBODY YOUR FRIEND YOUR BROTHER YOUR MISTRESS YOUR MISTRESS ABOVE ALL D'ARTAGNAN BLUSHED MY MISTRESS ABOVE ALL REPEATED HE MECHANICALLY
HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
BEWARE OF THE ENEMY WHO MAKES YOU PRESENTS
REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
AND HOW THE DEVIL DID YOU ESCAPE
WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN
THIS EVENING WILL COME THANK GOD AND PERHAPS YOU LOOK FOR IT WITH AS MUCH IMPATIENCE AS I DO PERHAPS THIS EVENING MADAME BONACIEUX WILL VISIT THE CONJUGAL DOMICILE
YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
DETAINED BY AN ACCUSATION OF COINING
THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
SHUN IT WERE IT WITH A CHILD OF TEN YEARS OLD IF YOU ARE ATTACKED BY DAY OR BY NIGHT FIGHT BUT RETREAT WITHOUT SHAME IF YOU CROSS A BRIDGE FEEL EVERY PLANK OF IT WITH YOUR FOOT
HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
BUT YOUR COMPANIONS I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE IN NEED OF ANY WE LEFT PARIS EACH WITH SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN HIS POCKET SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
HAS HE NOT ALL THE TRICKS OF A DEMON AT HIS COMMAND THE LEAST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IS THAT YOU WILL BE ARRESTED WHAT WILL THEY DARE TO ARREST A MAN IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE PARDIEU
WELL THEN I COUNT ON YOU AT THE APPOINTED HOUR I SHALL BE READY
YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME
AWAY BEHIND THE CURRANT ROW WHERE NO ONE ELSE BUT COOK MAY GO FAR IN THE PLOTS
TALKING BEE AND LADYBIRD
AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM
I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME
FOR ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO PUT IT ON HER VOICE TREMBLED TOO MUCH I RETORTED THE QUESTION WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT YOURSELF I SAID
I SAID I WILL GO HOME COME ALONG THEN AND LET ME SHUT THE DOOR AFTER YOU SOMEWHAT NETTLED WITH JAMIE DUFF'S INDIFFERENCE TO MY WELL MEANT EXERTIONS ON HIS BEHALF
AS SOON AS HE WAS AWAKE ENOUGH TO KNOW ME HE STOPPED CRYING BUT NOT STARING AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT IN THEM COME ALONG JAMIE I SAID I'M COME TO TAKE YOU HOME
SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH
NOT A WORD WILL HE DISCLOSE NOT A WORD OF ALL HE KNOWS
TO BLUE SPARKLING WITH GOLD I COULD SEE MUCH BETTER AND FANCIED I COULD HEAR BETTER TOO
HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS
AND IN LIFTING IT TO PULL HIM UP FOUND A CORD TIED TO HIS WRIST I WAS INDIGNANT
AND CERTAINLY AS OFTEN AS I DID SO IT ABATED FEAR IS A WORSE THING THAN DANGER I HAD TO PASS VERY NIGH THE POOL TO WHICH TURKEY AND I HAD GONE THE NIGHT OF OUR ADVENTURE WITH BOGBONNY'S BULL
GREAT IS THE SUN AND WIDE HE GOES THROUGH EMPTY HEAVEN WITH REPOSE AND IN THE BLUE AND GLOWING DAYS
I HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEHAVED VERY WELL TO MISS COLEMAN HE HAD PUT OFF THEIR MARRIAGE MORE THAN ONCE IN A COWARDLY FASHION
AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
THOUGH CLOSER STILL THE BLINDS WE PULL TO KEEP THE SHADY PARLOUR COOL YET HE WILL FIND A CHINK OR TWO TO SLIP HIS GOLDEN FINGERS THROUGH
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARING CROSS BUT I DON'T MIND WHERE I GO WELL I AM VERY TIRED IF YOU WILL TAKE ME TO CHARING CROSS I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU I HAVE WALKED FROM GRAVESEND
HE BARES TO ALL THE GARDEN GROUND AND SHEDS A WARM AND GLITTERING LOOK AMONG THE IVY'S INMOST NOOK ABOVE THE HILLS ALONG THE BLUE
I SHALL LET YOUR FATHER KNOW OF YOUR GOINGS ON SHE SAID RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE YOU NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE I SHALL TELL HIM MYSELF AT BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
I DARED NOT HAVE GONE ON MY OWN TWO LEGS IT WAS NOT THAT I COULD SO EASILY RUN AWAY WITH FOUR INSTEAD BUT THAT SOMEHOW I WAS LIFTED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF FEAR BY BEING UPON HER BACK
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
IN THE DARKNESS HOUSES SHINE PARENTS MOVE THE CANDLES TILL ON ALL THE NIGHT DIVINE TURNS THE BEDROOM HANDLES TILL AT LAST THE DAY BEGINS
THE MAID COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER DIAMOND HAVING SEEN HIM WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER BROUGHT THE LADIES HOME SO SHE BELIEVED HIM
FAIRY PLACES FAIRY THINGS FAIRY WOODS WHERE THE WILD BEE WINGS TINY TREES FOR TINY DAMES THESE MUST ALL BE FAIRY NAMES
SHE GAVE A CRY OF ALARM BUT PRESENTLY OPENED THE DOOR LOOKING PALE AND FRIGHTENED WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF DOORS THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT SHE ASKED BUT WITHOUT QUITE HER USUAL ARROGANCE
GARDEN DARKENED DAISY SHUT CHILD IN BED THEY SLUMBER GLOW WORM IN THE HALLWAY RUT MICE AMONG THE LUMBER
O'ER THE LAWN UP TO MY KNEE UNDER GRASS ALONE HE LIES LOOKING UP WITH LEADEN EYES SCARLET COAT AND POINTED GUN TO THE STARS AND TO THE SUN
YES THANK YOU MA'AM QUITE COMFORTABLE SAID JAMIE WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE BUT PLEASE MA'AM RANALD DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM HE'S A HOUSEBREAKER THOUGH
ROUND THE BRIGHT AIR WITH FOOTING TRUE
BUT DIAMOND WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING ONLY OF HIMSELF HE SAW THAT HIS NEW FRIEND LOOKED WEARY IF NOT ILL AND VERY POOR WON'T YOU JUMP IN SIR HE SAID I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE
JUST AS I SHOULD LIKE TO DO HE HAS SEEN THE STARRY HOURS AND THE SPRINGING OF THE FLOWERS AND THE FAIRY THINGS THAT PASS IN THE FORESTS OF THE GRASS
ONE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE MEWS ENGAGED HIM TO CARRY HIM TO THE CITY EVERY MORNING AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND DIAMOND WAS PUNCTUAL AS CLOCKWORK THOUGH TO EFFECT THAT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF CARE FOR HIS FATHER'S WATCH WAS NOT MUCH TO BE DEPENDED ON
DESIRING NOTHING BUT BED WHEN I CAME NEAR THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK I SAW A FIGURE ENTERING THE GATE FROM THE FRONT IT WAS IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON WHICH WAS NOW UP A GOOD WAY
THANK YOU MY MAN BUT I HAVE NO MONEY SO I CAN'T OH I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I SHALL BE MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU WILL GET IN YOU HAVE SAVED ME ALL I HAD I OWE YOU A LIFT SIR
BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT
BUT FOR ALL THAT'S GONE AND COME I SHALL FIND MY SOLDIER DUMB HE HAS LIVED A LITTLE THING IN THE GRASSY WOODS OF SPRING DONE IF HE COULD TELL ME TRUE
OLD AND SERIOUS
SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT PERCHED ON THE BOX WITH JUST HIS TOES TOUCHING THE GROUND
THAT'S VERY UNGRATEFUL OF YOU JAMIE I SAID FULL OF MY OWN IMPORTANCE WHEN I'VE COME SO FAR AND ALL AT NIGHT TOO TO SET YOU FREE I'M FREE ENOUGH SAID JAMIE
THE MOMENT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE CHANGED HIS COURSE FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWARD AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR MISTER COLEMAN'S POOR LITTLE HOUSE IN HOXTON
AND HOW HE HAD DONE AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT THEY ASKED HIM SUCH A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH HE COULD ANSWER AND SOME OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND HIS FATHER SEEMED EVER SO MUCH BETTER FROM FINDING THAT HIS BOY WAS ALREADY NOT ONLY USEFUL TO HIS FAMILY BUT USEFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE
TELL MISS COLEMAN IT'S MISS COLEMAN HE WANTS TO SEE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE MAID HE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE IS THOUGH AND I KNOW HIM AND SO DOES MISS COLEMAN
I GAVE THE CORD A GREAT TUG OF ANGER PULLED OUT MY KNIFE AND CUT IT THEN HAULING JAMIE UP GOT HIM HALF AWAKE AT LAST HE STARED WITH FRIGHT FIRST AND THEN BEGAN TO CRY
SHE SAID IN A GRUFF VOICE AS SHE ADVANCED ALONG THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT I STOOD UP AS BRAVELY AS I COULD IT'S ONLY ME MISS ADAM I SAID AND WHO ARE YOU
AND HUNT FOR HER FOOD AND MAKE CLOTHES FOR HER HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN
AND HAD NO SUSPICION THEREFORE OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY THIS TIME THE WIND HAD INCREASED ALMOST TO A HURRICANE AND AS THEY HAD OFTEN TO HEAD IT IT WAS NO JOKE FOR EITHER OF THE DIAMONDS THE DISTANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT
YOUNG DIAMOND JUMPED OFF HIS BOX
NO THANK YOU I SAID I SHALL BE GLAD TO GO TO BED I SHOULD THINK SO SHE ANSWERED JAMIE IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU AND I'LL TAKE CARE HE'S IN TIME FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING
BEFORE THEY REACHED THE STREET WHERE MISTER COLEMAN LIVED IT BLEW SO TREMENDOUSLY THAT WHEN MISS COLEMAN WHO WAS GOING OUT A LITTLE WAY OPENED THE DOOR IT DASHED AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH A BANG THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO VENTURE AND WENT IN AGAIN
IF YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING ME TO CHISWICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE IT'S A LONG WAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE FARE FROM THE DOCKS AND SOMETHING OVER VERY WELL SIR SAID DIAMOND I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY
THE GREY SMOKE TOWERS SING A SONG OF SEASONS SOMETHING BRIGHT IN ALL FLOWERS IN THE SUMMER
BETWEEN THE TWO HOWEVER HE DID MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT AFTER THAT FORTNIGHT HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AGAIN
WE HAVE BEAT THE MORNING DRUM PLAYMATE
IN WHICH CASE IT IS THE ONE FRIGHTFUL THING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO HE HAD COME BACK A MORE HUMBLE MAN AND LONGING TO ASK MISS COLEMAN TO FORGIVE HIM BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT RUIN HAD FALLEN UPON THEM
THIS GARDEN GROUND THAT NOW YOU SMOKE YOUR PIPE AROUND HAS SEEN IMMORTAL ACTIONS DONE
ALMOST AS SOON AS MISTER EVANS WENT IN THE WIND BEGAN TO CEASE AND WAS NOW STILL DIAMOND FOUND THAT BY MAKING THE BREECHING JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR THE OLD HORSE HE COULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE PRESENT
AT LENGTH I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE KEEPER'S FARM AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MOON PEEPED FROM BEHIND A HILL THROWING AS LONG SHADOWS AS THE SETTING SUN BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
OLD DIAMOND HAD SO MUCH ADO TO STOP THE CAB AGAINST IT
I CAME TO TAKE JAMIE HOME BUT HE WON'T GO YOU'RE A SILLY BOY TO THINK MY BROTHER JOHN WOULD DO HIM ANY HARM SHE RETURNED YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AREN'T YOU JAMIE DUFF
FOR DOORS WERE SELDOM LOCKED IN THE SUMMER NIGHTS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SHE MADE ME NO REPLY BUT TURNED AND LEFT ME NOT EVEN SHUTTING THE DOOR
THAT STORY WAS NOW FAR OFF IN THE PAST
THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
SHE WROTE ME A LETTER AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THEIR HOUSE AT DAYTON WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS EVENING ABOUT THIS TIME WASH WILLIAMS VOICE ROSE TO A HALF SCREAM
HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
AGAIN THE MAN'S VOICE BECAME SOFT AND LOW SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM NAKED HE WENT ON HER MOTHER DID THAT WHILE I SAT THERE SHE WAS TAKING THE GIRL'S CLOTHES OFF PERHAPS COAXING HER TO DO IT
GEORGE WILLARD AND THE STRANGE SHAPELESS MAN WHO LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOTEL HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TALKING THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT THE HIDEOUS LEERING FACE
HALF FRIGHTENED AND YET FASCINATED BY THE LIGHT BURNING IN THE EYES OF THE HIDEOUS OLD MAN GEORGE WILLARD LISTENED AFIRE WITH CURIOSITY DARKNESS CAME ON AND HE LEANED FORWARD
HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
HE TOOK CARE OF HIS HANDS HIS FINGERS WERE FAT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND SHAPELY IN THE HAND THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BY THE INSTRUMENT IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN HIS YOUTH
PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT
UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
AND WITH WHOM I SAW YOU WALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ALL OF THEM THEY ARE ALL DEAD I TELL YOU THERE IS SOMETHING ROTTEN ABOUT THEM I WAS MARRIED SURE MY WIFE WAS DEAD BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN SHE HAD GONE I CRIED LIKE A SILLY BOY PRETTY SOON I HAD A CHANCE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND I SENT THAT MONEY TO HER WASH WILLIAMS AND GEORGE WILLARD
THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
TOUCHED ME WITH HER HAND I WOULD PERHAPS FAINT AWAY I ACHED TO FORGIVE AND FORGET WASH WILLIAMS STOPPED AND STOOD STARING AT GEORGE WILLARD
IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
A HUGE GROTESQUE KIND OF MONKEY A CREATURE WITH UGLY SAGGING HAIRLESS SKIN BELOW HIS EYES AND A BRIGHT PURPLE UNDERBODY THIS MONKEY IS A TRUE MONSTER
RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
WHEN IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE PURPLE BLOATED FACE AND THE BURNING EYES A CURIOUS FANCY CAME TO HIM WASH WILLIAMS TALKED IN LOW EVEN TONES
FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID
THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
AND THEN THE NEIGHBORS CAME IN AND TOOK IT AWAY
ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
SHE WAS A FOUL THING COME OUT A WOMAN MORE FOUL SHE WAS A THING SENT TO MAKE LIFE UNBEARABLE TO ME I WAS A FOOL DO YOU SEE AS YOU ARE NOW AND SO I MARRIED THIS WOMAN
SHE IS A LIVING DEAD THING WALKING IN THE SIGHT OF MEN AND MAKING THE EARTH FOUL BY HER PRESENCE STARING INTO THE BOY'S EYES THE MAN BECAME PURPLE WITH RAGE DON'T HAVE FOOL NOTIONS IN YOUR HEAD
BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU NO MYSTERY IN REGARD TO THE BEAST IN HIS CAGE IT IS LIKE WASH WILLIAMS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS HE SITS IN THE CORNER THERE THE BEAST IS EXACTLY LIKE OLD WASH
I REMEMBER ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR NUMBER WHO USED TO WRITE LITTLE SONNETS ON BEHALF OF THE MAHDI AND THE SUDANESE THESE SONNETS SETTING FORTH THE NEED THAT THE SUDAN SHOULD BE BOTH INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL
FIRST I HEARD VOICES AT THE DOOR THAT LED INTO A LITTLE HALLWAY
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
WASH WILLIAMS BEGAN TELLING THE STORY OF HIS MARRIED LIFE WITH THE TALL BLONDE GIRL WITH THE BLUE EYES WHOM HE HAD MET WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG OPERATOR AT DAYTON OHIO HERE AND THERE HIS STORY WAS TOUCHED WITH MOMENTS OF BEAUTY
BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
VERY PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
CECILY WAS VERY PALE AND FELIX AND PETER WERE TAKING OFF THEIR COATS THERE WAS A PURE YELLOW SUNSET THAT EVENING
AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE ALAS YES NO JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
IT ISN'T FAIR OH FELIX DON'T TALK LIKE THAT SAID CECILY SHOCKED GOD MUST BE FAIR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE REASON PETER PRAYS THREE TIMES A DAY REGULAR
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON EARTH I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS
ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
AND THEN MY COURAGE SANK MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT
I MAY BE MISTAKEN BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY GIRL WANTED THAT FIGHT STOPPED
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED
CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
ROGER IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO WASH HIS BUGGY BE OFF
DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT I HEARD THE RAIN STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL
AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON AFAR IT OFFERED A PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
HE'S GOT TO STOP PRAYING AGAINST ME ANYHOW SAID FELIX RESOLUTELY
HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
AND FELT SORE WHENEVER I THOUGHT OF MY FAILURE BUT I HAD NO BURNING DESIRE TO EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT GRIMACING AND I DID NOT SYMPATHIZE OVER AND ABOVE WITH MY BROTHER WHEN HOWEVER HE TOOK TO PRAYING ABOUT IT
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
I WAS LOADED WITH GENERAL OPPROBRIUM UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
THE WARDROBE THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
FELIX MARCHED OVER TO UNCLE ROGER'S AND WE TRAILED AFTER SCENTING A SCENE WE FOUND PETER SHELLING BEANS IN THE GRANARY AND WHISTLING CHEERILY AS WITH A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENCE TOWARDS ALL MEN LOOK HERE PETER
ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
I SHOULD INSIST ALSO ON YOUR KEEPING SOME OF THOSE DRAWLING HALF INSINCERE COMPLAINTS HUSHED IN YOUR OWN BREAST
WHICH I FEEL REBEL INSOLENTLY AGAINST MY WILL AND STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS WHAT I HAD RESOLVED TO CONCEAL BUT I HAVE A VEIL IT IS DOWN
IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT MISTER ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION
BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERING
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT NOT BETRAY ME
STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE ORCHARD
NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO COLLOQUISE FURTHER I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD
SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
WE'LL TALK OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE CHESTNUT TREE
WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY WHAT DOES IT MEAN
JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE AS WE ARE
BUT OF THE CRUMBS HE SCATTERED TO STRAY AND STRANGER BIRDS LIKE ME WAS TO FEAST GENIALLY HIS LAST WORDS WERE BALM THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IMPORTED SOMETHING TO HIM
HOW IS IT TO BE HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL BECAUSE HE SAID
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
AND THAT ELIZA ACTUALLY TOOK THE VEIL AND IS AT THIS DAY SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT WHERE SHE PASSED THE PERIOD OF HER NOVITIATE AND WHICH SHE ENDOWED WITH HER FORTUNE
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND I HAVE KNOWN YOU MISTER ROCHESTER AND IT STRIKES ME WITH TERROR
I AVOIDED SOBBING THE THOUGHT OF MISSUS O'GALL AND BITTERNUTT LODGE STRUCK
EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
WHEN I DID SPEAK IT WAS ONLY TO EXPRESS AN IMPETUOUS WISH THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN OR NEVER COME TO THORNFIELD BECAUSE YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE IT
TO A SIMILAR STRING SITUATED IN THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF YOUR LITTLE FRAME
HE IS FLOWN THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MISTER ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID TURN BACK
MISSUS FAIRFAX SURMISED
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
WITH REGARD TO YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME AS NOW IT IS AS IF I HAD A STRING SOMEWHERE UNDER MY LEFT RIBS TIGHTLY AND INEXTRICABLY KNOTTED
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I AM POOR OBSCURE PLAIN AND LITTLE I AM SOULLESS AND HEARTLESS YOU THINK WRONG I HAVE AS MUCH SOUL AS YOU
YOU'RE NOT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO LOOK AFTER MORE MOTHS ARE YOU THAT WAS ONLY A LADY CLOCK CHILD FLYING AWAY HOME
WHAT BRIDE I HAVE NO BRIDE BUT YOU WILL HAVE YES I WILL I WILL HE SET HIS TEETH
I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF SUCH A VERY EXCELLENT THING AS MY BEAUTIFUL BLANCHE WELL AS I WAS SAYING LISTEN TO ME JANE
DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE VEIL I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION
BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND YOU'LL LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
ANOTHER EFFORT SET ME AT LIBERTY AND I STOOD
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
WHICH IS SUCH THAT I HAVE MADE IT MY LAW OF ACTION ADELE MUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU MISS EYRE MUST GET A NEW SITUATION YES SIR
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT SADLY FAILS ME IN FRAMING AN EXCUSE AND ALWAYS THE LAPSE OCCURS AT SOME CRISIS
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT I SHALL TAKE UP MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE
DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN
WELL SIR I SHALL BE READY WHEN THE ORDER TO MARCH COMES IT IS COME NOW I MUST GIVE IT TO NIGHT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED SIR
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T MUCH CARE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR SEPARATE WAY
YET A MONTH ELAPSED BEFORE I QUITTED GATESHEAD I WISHED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FUNERAL BUT GEORGIANA ENTREATED ME TO STAY TILL SHE COULD GET OFF TO LONDON WHITHER
I HAD MADE NO NOISE HE HAD NOT EYES BEHIND COULD HIS SHADOW FEEL I STARTED AT FIRST AND THEN I APPROACHED HIM
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
A PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART
INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
HE MUST DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OR HE WILL BECOME DISLIKED AUTHOR
THE KING CAME AROUND TO BERWICK FROM DUNBAR BY STEAMER
UNTIL HE JOTS DOWN AN INVENTORY OF THE WOMAN'S DRESS THAT IS MANIFESTLY ABSURD IT REMINDS A PERSON OF THOSE DENTISTS WHO SECURE YOUR INSTANT AND BREATHLESS INTEREST IN A TOOTH
BUT LONGING TO LAY HER POOR ACHING HEAD YET ONCE AGAIN UPON THE BREAST OF HIM WHOM SHE LOVED MORE DEARLY THAN LIFE ITSELF PARTED HOWEVER IT IS NOT WELL
BUT THE SCOTCH CALLED TO THEIR AID ROBERT BRUCE THE GRANDSON OF BALIOL'S COMPETITOR AND HE WAS SOLEMNLY CROWNED AT THE ABBEY OF SCONE DURING A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE PEOPLE EDWARD FELL SICK
SO FAR AS THE STEAMER IS CONCERNED BUT THE STATEMENT CAN DO NO HARM
THIS WAS IN TWELVE NINETY FIVE AND ON THIS DECLARATION
N B I WAS INFORMED LATER BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION WHICH PERMITS ONE TO SAY
MAKING PENS WITHIN PENS FINALLY ALL THE PARENTHESES
HE WOULD ALSO HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BREAK ANY COLLECTOR TO BUY IT HARRIS AND I HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ON OUR GERMAN DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AT THAT TIME AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS
AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA PAVLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD
BENEATH THE POLITENESS AND AFFECTED SYMPATHY OF WHICH INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IRONY COULD BE DISCERNED CAN ONE BE WELL WHILE SUFFERING MORALLY CAN ONE BE CALM IN TIMES LIKE THESE IF ONE HAS ANY FEELING
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON'T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES
THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF IT CAN'T BE HELPED HE SAID NO MORE BUT EXPRESSED HIS RESIGNATION TO CRUEL FATE BY A GESTURE ANNA PAVLOVNA MEDITATED
THEY GET IN A HURRY AND HAVE TO GO TO PRESS WITHOUT GETTING TO THE VERB AT ALL OF COURSE THEN THE READER IS LEFT IN A VERY EXHAUSTED AND IGNORANT STATE WE HAVE THE PARENTHESIS DISEASE
IT IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AFTER THINGS WHICH ARE OF NO SORT OF CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY WHERE IS THE BIRD NOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE BOOK IS
WHENEVER TIMES WERE HARD THE JEWS WERE IMPRISONED AND ON ONE JOB LOT ALONE TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS WERE REALIZED IN RANSOM AND STILL THE JEWS ARE NOT YET CONSIDERED AS AMONG THE REDEEMED IN TWELVE NINETY
SLAFE WITH AN F AS A VILLAGE ELDER OF MINE WRITES IN HIS REPORTS SHE IS RICH AND OF GOOD FAMILY AND THAT'S ALL I WANT AND WITH THE FAMILIARITY AND EASY GRACE PECULIAR TO HIM
TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOM THAT DOES NOT EXIST
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND THE MONUMENT IS FINISHED I SUPPOSE
THAT IT IS NO MOONLIGHT FROLIC EDWARD FLED TO WALES
AND OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSE
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
FOR IF A CERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHIC ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
BRUCE SURPRISED THE CAVALRY WITH DEEP PITS AND BEFORE THE ENGLISH COULD RECOVER FROM THIS
WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
AND COMPLACENTLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA FIRST OF ALL DEAR FRIEND TELL ME HOW YOU ARE SET YOUR FRIEND'S MIND AT REST
BY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MAN'S FREE WILL
IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILT WERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCE
FURTHER DISAGREEMENTS RECORDED ILLUSTRATING THE AMIABILITY OF THE JEW AND THE PERVERSITY OF THE SCOT IN TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT THE JEWS TO THE NUMBER OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE HANGED FOR HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION CLIPPED COINS
IN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER ON BOTH SIDES THE STRUGGLE PROVOKES PASSION AND STIFLES TRUTH ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS FEAR AND REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES
AND DENTISTRY ARE IN BAD TASTE THE GERMANS
AFTER HAVING BEEN MOST INHUMANLY TREATED IN BERKELEY CASTLE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN REMOVED THUS ENDS THE SAD HISTORY OF A MONARCH WHO MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A MINOR POSITION ON A HEN FARM BUT WHO MADE A BEASTLY FLUKE IN THE KING BUSINESS
LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
MAINLY OF COMPOUND WORDS CONSTRUCTED BY THE WRITER ON THE SPOT AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY DICTIONARY SIX OR SEVEN WORDS COMPACTED INTO ONE WITHOUT JOINT OR SEAM THAT IS
BUT I WARN YOU IF YOU DON'T TELL ME THAT THIS MEANS WAR IF YOU STILL TRY TO DEFEND THE INFAMIES AND HORRORS PERPETRATED BY THAT ANTICHRIST I REALLY BELIEVE HE IS ANTICHRIST I WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH YOU
HAS TO PERFORM THE NOBLEST ROLE ON EARTH
AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY'S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY
AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN UNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY
THE GRAMMATICAL HOROSCOPE OF THIS MATTER I ANSWER UP CONFIDENTLY AND STATE IN GERMAN THAT THE BIRD IS STAYING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
NOT NECESSARY BUT PRETTY GERMAN BOOKS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO READ WHEN YOU HOLD THEM BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS OR STAND ON YOUR HEAD SO AS TO REVERSE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT I THINK
I BEGIN TO CIPHER OUT THE GERMAN FOR THAT ANSWER I BEGIN AT THE WRONG END NECESSARILY FOR THAT IS THE GERMAN IDEA I SAY TO MYSELF
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOUR PRODIGAL SON ANATOLE SHE ASKED THEY SAY OLD MAIDS HAVE A MANIA FOR MATCHMAKING AND THOUGH I DON'T FEEL THAT WEAKNESS IN MYSELF AS YET
THIS RAIN IS NOT RESTING BUT IS DOING SOMETHING ACTIVELY IT IS FALLING TO INTERFERE WITH THE BIRD LIKELY AND THIS INDICATES MOVEMENT
AND FINDS THAT THERE ARE MORE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THAN INSTANCES OF IT SO OVERBOARD HE GOES AGAIN TO HUNT FOR ANOTHER ARARAT AND FIND ANOTHER QUICKSAND SUCH HAS BEEN
BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN SENT INSTEAD OF OUR DEAR WINTZINGERODE YOU WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE KING OF PRUSSIA'S CONSENT BY ASSAULT YOU ARE SO ELOQUENT WILL YOU GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA IN A MOMENT
THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
IN SATIN AND SILK COVERED NOW VERY UNCONSTRAINED AFTER THE NEWEST FASHIONED DRESSED
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
YOUNG BOLKONSKI'S WIFE THIS VERY EVENING AND PERHAPS THE THING CAN BE ARRANGED
BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH
TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME IS NOT GIVEN
AND ONE DAY I SURPRISED THE KEEPER OF IT WITH MY GERMAN I SPOKE ENTIRELY IN THAT LANGUAGE HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED
SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA YOU ARE STAYING THE WHOLE EVENING I HOPE
ON THE OTHER IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN GOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
I WILL NOT HESITATE HOWEVER TO AVOW MY BELIEF THAT IT HAS BEEN MY SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE VERY EARLY IN LIFE FALLEN IN WITH CERTAIN TRACKS WHICH HAVE CONDUCTED ME TO CONSIDERATIONS AND MAXIMS OF WHICH I HAVE FORMED A METHOD THAT GIVES ME THE MEANS AS I THINK
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
AS ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOUL OF MAN AND THAT OF THE BRUTES AND IN THE LAST WHAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GREATER ADVANCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE THAN HAS YET BEEN MADE WITH THE REASONS THAT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO WRITE
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
AFTER A MOMENT TOO TOO SAID
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
SO THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THE STUDY CONSISTED IN THIS THAT OBSERVING MANY THINGS WHICH HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND RIDICULOUS TO OUR APPREHENSION
SUCH IGNORANCE SNIFFED TOO TOO A DROP OF WATER FALLING OFF THE CEILING WOULD HAVE MADE TEN TIMES AS MUCH NOISE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
I LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN TOO DECIDED A BELIEF IN REGARD TO NOTHING OF THE TRUTH OF WHICH I HAD BEEN PERSUADED MERELY BY EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND THUS
AS WELL AS FURTHER ALL THE ARTS AN LESSEN THE LABOUR OF MAN THAT NUMEROUS HIGHLY USEFUL PRECEPTS AND EXHORTATIONS TO VIRTUE ARE CONTAINED IN TREATISES ON MORALS THAT THEOLOGY POINTS OUT THE PATH TO HEAVEN
AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
AND SAID THEY WOULD THROW MY UNCLE INTO THE SEA IF HE DIDN'T DO AS THEY SAID THEY SENT ME DOWNSTAIRS AND I HEARD THE NOISE OF A FIGHT GOING ON ABOVE AND WHEN THEY LET ME COME UP AGAIN NEXT DAY
I ESTEEMED ELOQUENCE HIGHLY AND WAS IN RAPTURES WITH POESY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BOTH WERE GIFTS OF NATURE RATHER THAN FRUITS OF STUDY THOSE IN WHOM THE FACULTY OF REASON IS PREDOMINANT AND WHO MOST SKILLFULLY DISPOSE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THEM CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE
AND WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR PASSING PORPOISES AND SOON A WHOLE SCHOOL CAME DANCING AND JUMPING THROUGH THE WATER ON THEIR WAY TO BRAZIL WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTOR LEANING ON THE RAIL OF HIS SHIP THEY CAME OVER TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
SAID THE OWL SH THERE IT IS AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR THAT NO I DO NOT SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT KIND OF A SOUND IS IT
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
LISTEN AGAIN AND TELL ME WHAT HE'S DOING NOW I'M NOT SURE YET SAID TOO TOO IF IT'S A MAN AT ALL MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN
THE IMPOSTURES OF A MAGICIAN OR BY THE ARTIFICES AND BOASTING OF ANY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT FOR THESE REASONS AS SOON AS MY AGE PERMITTED ME TO PASS FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF MY INSTRUCTORS
IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
IN A CONDITION WHICH COMPELLED ME TO MAKE MERCHANDISE OF SCIENCE FOR THE BETTERING OF MY FORTUNE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO SCORN GLORY AS A CYNIC
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
BUT THEY GIVE US NO ADEQUATE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND FREQUENTLY THAT WHICH THEY DESIGNATE WITH SO FINE A NAME IS BUT APATHY OR PRIDE OR DESPAIR OR PARRICIDE I REVERED OUR THEOLOGY AND ASPIRED AS MUCH AS ANY ONE TO REACH HEAVEN
I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
BUT I BELIEVED THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO LANGUAGES AND LIKEWISE TO THE READING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO THEIR HISTORIES AND FABLES
ON THE OTHER HAND I COMPARED THE DISQUISITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORALISTS TO VERY TOWERING AND MAGNIFICENT PALACES WITH NO BETTER FOUNDATION THAN SAND AND MUD THEY LAUD THE VIRTUES VERY HIGHLY AND EXHIBIT THEM AS ESTIMABLE FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH
WHAT I'M DOING NOW
AND WHO CAN GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEM WITH THE GREATEST EMBELLISHMENT AND HARMONY ARE STILL THE BEST POETS THOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF POETRY I WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MATHEMATICS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CERTITUDE AND EVIDENCE OF THEIR REASONINGS
AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
PARDON ME BUT I CAN SAID TOO TOO I TELL YOU THERE IS SOME ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET ALMOST
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
THAT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD ADVANCED NO FARTHER IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING THAN THE DISCOVERY AT EVERY TURN OF MY OWN IGNORANCE AND YET I WAS STUDYING IN ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOOLS IN EUROPE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE LEARNED MEN
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
DOES NOT ARISE FROM SOME BEING ENDOWED WITH A LARGER SHARE OF REASON THAN OTHERS BUT SOLELY FROM THIS THAT WE CONDUCT OUR THOUGHTS ALONG DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO NOT FIX OUR ATTENTION ON THE SAME OBJECTS
FOR MYSELF I HAVE NEVER FANCIED MY MIND TO BE IN ANY RESPECT MORE PERFECT THAN THOSE OF THE GENERALITY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I WERE EQUAL TO SOME OTHERS IN PROMPTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR IN CLEARNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF IMAGINATION
ASKED THE PORPOISES YES SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S THE MAN HAS HE BEEN DROWNED
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
THEY MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE AND WHEN THEIR BRAT CRIES I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL BUT HAVE TO ROCK THE CRADLE DEAR GRANDPAPA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE
INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
MY LIFE IS A MISFORTUNE WORSE THAN ANY DOG'S I SEND GREETINGS TO ALIONA TO ONE EYED TEGOR AND THE COACHMAN AND DON'T LET ANY ONE HAVE MY MOUTH ORGAN I REMAIN YOUR GRANDSON
HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
FOOD THERE IS NONE IN THE MORNING IT'S BREAD AT DINNER GRUEL AND IN THE EVENING BREAD AGAIN AS FOR TEA OR SOUR CABBAGE SOUP THE MASTER AND THE MISTRESS THEMSELVES GUZZLE THAT
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
RATHER THAN THE ROUTING BY OUR GREEN WARRIORS OF A HORDE OF SIMILAR THOUGH UNFRIENDLY CREATURES I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SEEMING HALLUCINATION NOR COULD I FREE MYSELF FROM IT BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY SOUL I FELT A STRANGE YEARNING TOWARD THESE UNKNOWN FOEMEN
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
BUT IT HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT AS IT WAS TO START ME SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBLE HORROR WHICH LURKED IN THE SHADOWS AT MY BACK FEAR IS A RELATIVE TERM AND SO I CAN ONLY MEASURE MY FEELINGS AT THAT TIME BY WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS POSITIONS OF DANGER AND BY THOSE THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH SINCE
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
AND SEEMED BUT BARELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR DEPLETED CREWS THEIR FIRE HAD CEASED ENTIRELY AND ALL THEIR ENERGIES SEEMED FOCUSED UPON ESCAPE OUR WARRIORS THEN RUSHED UP TO THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS WHICH WE OCCUPIED
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
MY BREATH WAS COMING IN QUICK SHORT GASPS COLD SWEAT STOOD OUT FROM EVERY PORE OF MY BODY AND THE ANCIENT EXPERIMENT OF PINCHING REVEALED THE FACT THAT I WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WRAITH
BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS
EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
I REALIZED I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER SIGNAL AND IGNORANT AS I WAS OF MARTIAN CUSTOMS I INTUITIVELY FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE AN APPEAL FOR SUCCOR AND PROTECTION WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE IGNORANCE HAD PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING
AND A MIGHTY HOPE SURGED THROUGH ME THAT THE FLEET WOULD RETURN AND DEMAND A RECKONING FROM THE GREEN WARRIORS WHO HAD SO RUTHLESSLY AND WANTONLY ATTACKED IT CLOSE AT MY HEEL IN HIS NOW ACCUSTOMED PLACE FOLLOWED WOOLA THE HOUND
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL WAS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO HOPE TO REACH HER DECKS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BODIES OF HER CREW STREWN ABOUT ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES THEY MIGHT BE
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE UNNECESSARY HARSHNESS AND BRUTALITY WITH WHICH HER GUARDS TREATED HER SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ALMOST MATERNAL KINDLINESS WHICH SOLA MANIFESTED TOWARD ME AND THE RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE FEW GREEN MARTIANS WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO NOTICE ME AT ALL
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
I ATTEMPTED TO SPRING TO MY FEET BUT WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT MY MUSCLES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY WILL I WAS NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKE BUT AS UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE IT WAS THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS UPON HOG BACK AND ARROYO AND THE GROTESQUE DETAILS OF THE STIFF YET BEAUTIFUL CACTI FORM A PICTURE AT ONCE ENCHANTING AND INSPIRING AS THOUGH ONE WERE CATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME A GLIMPSE OF SOME DEAD AND FORGOTTEN WORLD
THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS FIRED A TERRIFIC VOLLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS FACING THE LITTLE VALLEY ACROSS WHICH THE GREAT SHIPS WERE SO PEACEFULLY ADVANCING INSTANTLY THE SCENE CHANGED AS BY MAGIC
BUT WHY I SHOULD RETAIN MY MENTAL FACULTIES AND YET BE UNABLE TO MOVE I COULD NOT FATHOM I LAY FACING THE OPENING OF THE CAVE AND WHERE I COULD SEE THE SHORT STRETCH OF TRAIL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE CAVE AND THE TURN OF THE CLIFF AROUND WHICH THE TRAIL LED
HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE CAPTIVE'S GUARDS AND IT WAS TOWARD HER THE QUESTION TURNED WHEN ASKED ONE OF THE WOMEN WILL WE ENJOY THE DEATH THROES OF THE RED ONE OR DOES LORQUAS PTOMEL JED INTEND HOLDING HER FOR RANSOM
INDEED SAVE FOR HER HIGHLY WROUGHT ORNAMENTS SHE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED NOR COULD ANY APPAREL HAVE ENHANCED THE BEAUTY OF HER PERFECT AND SYMMETRICAL FIGURE AS HER GAZE RESTED ON ME HER EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT AND SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGN WITH HER FREE HAND
I COULD SEE FIGURES CROWDING THE FORWARD DECKS AND UPPER WORKS OF THE AIR CRAFT WHETHER THEY HAD DISCOVERED US OR SIMPLY WERE LOOKING AT THE DESERTED CITY I COULD NOT SAY BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY RECEIVED A RUDE RECEPTION FOR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
AS THE EMPTYING OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CARBOYS UPON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SAILORS AND OVER THE DECKS AND WORKS OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION CONCLUDED THEY HASTILY CLAMBERED OVER HER SIDES SLIDING DOWN THE GUY ROPES TO THE GROUND
AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
AND A BEARING AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND MENACING LATER SOLA WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL OF THE OTHER WOMEN REMODELED THE TRAPPINGS TO FIT MY LESSER PROPORTIONS AND AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WORK I WENT ABOUT GARBED IN ALL THE PANOPLY OF WAR
THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE AND TO MY DISTORTED IMAGINATION TO BE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME UNABLE LONGER TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ESCAPE THIS HORRIBLE PLACE I LEAPED QUICKLY THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE STARLIGHT OF A CLEAR ARIZONA NIGHT
TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
THEY ALL LAPSED INTO SILENCE AND WERE SOON ASLEEP ONE THING THE EPISODE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO ASSURE ME OF SOLA'S FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE POOR GIRL AND ALSO TO CONVINCE ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HER HANDS RATHER THAN THOSE OF SOME OF THE OTHER FEMALES
AND SAVAGE EYES LOOKED INTO MINE THAT HE COULD SEE ME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CAVE I WAS SURE FOR THE EARLY MORNING SUN WAS FALLING FULL UPON ME THROUGH THE OPENING THE FELLOW INSTEAD OF APPROACHING MERELY STOOD AND STARED
AND HER EYES MET MINE HER FACE WAS OVAL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME HER EVERY FEATURE WAS FINELY CHISELED AND EXQUISITE HER EYES LARGE AND LUSTROUS AND HER HEAD SURMOUNTED BY A MASS OF COAL BLACK WAVING HAIR
CONVINCED ME THAT THE NOISES I HAD HEARD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM PURELY NATURAL AND HARMLESS CAUSES
THAT ONE OF THE BRAVES WAS HURLED HEADLONG FROM THE CLIFF TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEIR WILD CRIES ECHOED IN THE CANYON FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN ALL WAS STILL ONCE MORE THE SOUND WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED THEM WAS NOT REPEATED
THE ENTIRE CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS MASTODONS AND MOUNTED WARRIORS WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SOLA AND I HAD ENTERED A BUILDING UPON THE FRONT OF THE CITY IN FACT THE SAME ONE IN WHICH I HAD HAD MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE APES AND WISHING TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE SUDDEN RETREAT
WITH THE EYES STARING TOWARD THE OPEN LEDGE AND THE HANDS RESTING LIMPLY UPON THE GROUND I LOOKED FIRST AT MY LIFELESS CLAY THERE UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE AND THEN DOWN AT MYSELF IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT FOR THERE I LAY CLOTHED
I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
SO DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE ASPECT OF ANY OTHER SPOT UPON OUR EARTH AS I STOOD THUS MEDITATING I TURNED MY GAZE FROM THE LANDSCAPE TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE MYRIAD STARS FORMED A GORGEOUS AND FITTING CANOPY FOR THE WONDERS OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
SUDDENLY A LOW BUT DISTINCT MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CAVE BEHIND ME AND AS IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE INDIANS THEY TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR PANIC STRICKEN SO FRANTIC WERE THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE UNSEEN THING BEHIND ME
I HAD NO DESIRE TO FACE THE UNSEEN THING WHICH MENACED ME MY REVOLVERS WERE STRAPPED TO MY LIFELESS BODY WHICH FOR SOME UNFATHOMABLE REASON I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO TOUCH MY CARBINE WAS IN ITS BOOT STRAPPED TO MY SADDLE
THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
WHAT DID YOU PROMISE YOURSELF THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES INDIGNANT AT BEING KEPT FROM HIS HAPPINESS BY THIS WICKED OLD WOMAN WENT UP TO HER AND THREATENING HER WITH HIS SWORD SAID GET AWAY OUT OF MY COUNTRY AT ONCE
THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD ALSO SEEN BELLISSIMA AND SHE TRIED TO READ IN THE KING'S EYES THE EFFECT THAT THIS UNEXPECTED SIGHT HAD HAD UPON HIM NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN SAID HE
AND I SHALL BE VERY ANGRY IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY ONE OF HER LOVERS CLEVER OR HANDSOME ENOUGH FOR HER
AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
OR NOT SO WITH GREAT CARE SHE MADE SOME OF THE PROPER CAKE TO PACIFY THE LIONS
SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT
AND NEVER TRIED TO CORRECT ANY OF HER FAULTS THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THIS LITTLE PERSON WHO WAS AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE AND WAS ONE DAY TO WEAR A CROWN
SAVE ME THIS MINUTE OR I SHALL DIE OF TERROR INDEED AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE
AS SOON AS HE LOST SIGHT OF ME BUT WHO CAN MY RIVAL BE WHOSE FATAL BEAUTY IS GREATER THAN MINE WHILE SHE WAS SAYING THIS THE KING WHO REALLY LOVED HER AS MUCH AS EVER
EVERYTHING BECAME DARK AND HE FELT HIMSELF CARRIED ALONG THROUGH THE AIR BY A STRONG HAND THIS NEW MISFORTUNE WAS THE WORK OF THE WICKED FAIRY OF THE DESERT WHO HAD COME WITH THE YELLOW DWARF TO HELP HIM CARRY OFF THE PRINCESS
I AM TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MATTER FOR HER TO PROMISE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY CONSENT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS CRIED THE DWARF SUDDENLY
AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE ME ALWAYS WITH HER HANDSOME AGREEABLE AND GAY AS YOU SEE ME NOW FOR IF HER SHADOW STAYS BY HER MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO I SHALL BE SURPRISED
SO SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HER PRISONER'S BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE
AND THEN UP THE TREE AND THERE SHE SAW A LITTLE TINY MAN WHO WAS EATING ORANGES OH QUEEN SAID HE I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW MUCH AFRAID YOU ARE OF THE LIONS
DID NOT SPARE PRETTY SPEECHES AND AFTER A TIME HE WAS ALLOWED TO WALK BY HIMSELF UPON THE SEA SHORE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD BY HER ENCHANTMENTS RAISED SUCH A TERRIBLE STORM THAT THE BOLDEST PILOT WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT IN IT
SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO SOME FRIGHTFUL CAVERN AND CHAINED HIM TO A ROCK THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET BELLISSIMA AND BECOME HER SLAVE SO AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE PLACE
THOUGHT THEMSELVES VERY LUCKY IF THE PRINCESS SAID THAT'S PRETTY ALL THIS ADMIRATION VASTLY PLEASED THE QUEEN NOT A DAY PASSED BUT SHE RECEIVED SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND SONNETS
THE QUEEN WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND SHE GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT TO GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS AND TO CHOOSE THE JEWELS THAT THE PRINCESS WAS TO WEAR THESE WERE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS
THE TERRIBLE LIONS AND HER PROMISE TO THE YELLOW DWARF THAT HE SHOULD MARRY BELLISSIMA MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM BUT THERE WAS THE NEW CAP WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL RIBBON AND LACE TO REMIND HER THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE WHICH MADE HER SO UNHAPPY
AND WERE BRIGHT RED AT THIS DREADFUL SIGHT THE POOR QUEEN WHO WAS TREMBLING LIKE A DOVE WHEN IT SEES A HAWK CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD
AND BEGGED HER TO FORGIVE HIM AT LAST THE HAPPY DAY CAME EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BELLISSIMA'S WEDDING THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED
SHE GAVE HIM BACK HIS SIGHT BUT WITHOUT RELEASING HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND BY HER MAGIC POWER SHE APPEARED BEFORE HIM AS A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL FAIRY AND PRETENDED TO HAVE COME THERE QUITE BY CHANCE WHAT DO I SEE SHE CRIED
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE THEM MY COMPASSION THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS QUITE OVERCOME BY THE PRINCESS'S GOOD NATURED WAY OF TAKING HIS INTERFERENCE AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET HE KISSED HER HAND A THOUSAND TIMES
NOT A TRACE OF IT COULD SHE FIND THE MORE SHE HUNTED FOR IT THE MORE FRIGHTENED SHE GOT AND AT LAST SHE BEGAN TO CRY THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE SAW BEFORE HER THE YELLOW DWARF WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU MY PRETTY ONE SAID HE
AND SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON A CRUTCH THIS STRANGE OLD WOMAN WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD HOBBLED THREE TIMES ROUND THE GALLERY FOLLOWED BY THE BASILISKS THEN STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A DWARF THAT YOU ARE SO UGLY THAT ONE CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK AT YOU AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU MYSELF LONG BEFORE THIS IF YOU HAD BEEN WORTHY OF SUCH A GLORIOUS DEATH
YOU HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF DYING UNMARRIED A LOVELY PRINCESS LIKE YOU MUST SURELY PREFER TO DIE RATHER THAN BE THE WIFE OF A POOR LITTLE DWARF LIKE MYSELF OH DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME CRIED THE PRINCESS CLASPING HER HANDS
SEEING THAT I HAVE LOST THE BASKET OF CAKE
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
AND THAT NEITHER OF THESE WAS THE REAL REASON OF THE QUEEN'S UNEASINESS SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD GO AND CONSULT THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD HOW WISE SHE WAS
BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS AND HOW ANGRY IT MADE ALL THE OTHER KINGS TO LOSE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF MARRYING THE PRINCESS BUT AFTER ALL
NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
AND MANY LITTLE BROOKS MURMURED SOFTLY UNDER THE SHADY TREES WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS COOL AND FRESH A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE OF TRANSPARENT EMERALDS
THE QUEEN CAUSED HER PORTRAIT TO BE TAKEN BY THE CLEVEREST PAINTERS AND SENT IT TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORING KINGS WITH WHOM SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY
AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
TRUSTY COUNSELLOR LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE TO THE CHARMING FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO PLEASE HER AND HE AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO CURL HIS HAIR
HOW IS THIS WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR PITY ON THESE PRINCES WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY A SINGLE SMILE FROM YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY ANSWERED BELLISSIMA
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
AND TAKE AWAY FROM HIM A PROUD PRINCESS
NOW THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AS SHE WAS GUARDED BY SOME TERRIBLE LIONS BUT HAPPILY THE QUEEN HAD HEARD A LONG TIME BEFORE THAT WHOEVER WANTED TO PASS THESE LIONS SAFELY MUST THROW TO THEM A CAKE MADE OF MILLET FLOUR
BELLISSIMA IS PRETTY ENOUGH BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO MARRY HER YOU CAN KEEP HER OH NOBLE SIR SAID THE QUEEN IN GREAT DISTRESS DO NOT REFUSE HER
AND BRANDISHING HER CRUTCH THREATENINGLY SHE CRIED
BUT BY HER VOICE I RECOGNIZED HER AS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT THOUGH WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE CARRIED ME OFF FOR I CANNOT TELL YOU AH CRIED THE PRETENDED FAIRY IF YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS YOU WON'T GET AWAY UNTIL YOU HAVE MARRIED HER
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE GAYEST AND MOST REFINED COURTS
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
STIRRED BY WILD WINDS FROM DEPTH TO HEIGHT THOU HOLD'ST MY LOVED ONE FAR FROM ME AND I AM CAPTIVE TO THY MIGHT MY HEART IS STILL MORE WILD THAN THINE
IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
UTTERED SUCH PIERCING CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KING HEARING THEM ENTIRELY LOST HIS COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND GIVING UP THE COMBAT HE FLEW TOWARD THE PRINCESS
I SHALL BE EATEN UP AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN A SINGLE STEP SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP
AS THROUGH THIS ENCHANTED LAND
WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
OUT OF CHARITY I WILL TAKE HER BUT BE SURE AND DON'T FORGET THAT SHE IS MINE AS HE SPOKE A LITTLE DOOR OPENED IN THE TRUNK OF THE ORANGE TREE
AN A LEARNING EM TO DRINK AND SWEAR
MA I'VE ENLISTED HE HAD SAID TO HER DIFFIDENTLY THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE THE LORD'S WILL BE DONE HENRY SHE HAD FINALLY REPLIED AND HAD THEN CONTINUED TO MILK THE BRINDLE COW
OF HEAVY CROWNS AND HIGH CASTLES THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY WHICH HE HAD REGARDED AS THE TIME OF WARS BUT IT HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN LONG GONE OVER THE HORIZON
A NEGRO TEAMSTER WHO HAD BEEN DANCING UPON A CRACKER BOX
HE HAD MADE FIRM REBELLION AGAINST THIS YELLOW LIGHT THROWN UPON THE COLOR OF HIS AMBITIONS THE NEWSPAPERS THE GOSSIP OF THE VILLAGE HIS OWN PICTURINGS HAD AROUSED HIM TO AN UNCHECKABLE DEGREE THEY WERE IN TRUTH FIGHTING FINELY DOWN THERE
MADE ENDLESS THREATS TO SET ABLAZE THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT
IF SO BE A TIME COMES WHEN YEH HAVE TO BE KILT OF DO A MEAN THING WHY HENRY
HE HAD THE REFINEMENT OF LOOK AND AIR OF COMMAND WHICH ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL FAMILIES OF NEW ENGLAND BUT AS DARWIN SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THERE IS NO SUCH KING AS A SEA CAPTAIN
HE WAS A SLIGHTLY RAGGED MAN WHO SPAT SKILLFULLY BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND POSSESSED A GREAT FUND OF BLAND AND INFANTILE ASSURANCE THE YOUTH LIKED HIM PERSONALLY YANK THE OTHER HAD INFORMED HIM
THAT TOLD HIM THAT HER STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT CAME FROM A DEEP CONVICTION MOREOVER ON HER SIDE WAS HIS BELIEF THAT HER ETHICAL MOTIVE IN THE ARGUMENT WAS IMPREGNABLE AT LAST HOWEVER
AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY STAYED THERE AND HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
AND TALK A TERRIBLE WHILE ABOUT THEIR HAVIN SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF KEEPIN EM HE WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST CAPTAINS
AND THE SHEEP BELL TINKLED AWAY IN HASTE AS IF SOMEONE HAD SHAKEN A STICK IN ITS WEARER'S FACE THEN I LOOKED AND SAW CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE PASSING THE NEAREST WINDOW THE NEXT MOMENT HE TAPPED POLITELY AT THE DOOR COME IN SIR
BUT I LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE EXPLAINED THE WINDS HAVING BECOME CONTRARY AND TALKED ON IN A DREARY SORT OF WAY ABOUT HIS VOYAGE THE BAD WEATHER AND THE DISADVANTAGES HE WAS UNDER IN THE LIGHTNESS OF HIS SHIP WHICH BOUNCED ABOUT LIKE A CHIP IN A BUCKET
THE FIRST TIME BUT I THINK THEY'LL FIGHT BETTER THAN SOME IF WORSE THAN OTHERS
THAT ALL OF THE UNTRIED MEN POSSESSED GREAT AND CORRECT CONFIDENCE HE NOW
SAID THE LOUD ONE THE YOUTH REMAINED SILENT FOR A TIME AT LAST
NUMBERS MAKING FUTILE BIDS FOR THE POPULAR
DON'T FORGIT ABOUT THE SOCKS AND THE SHIRTS CHILD AND I'VE PUT A CUP OF BLACKBERRY JAM WITH YER BUNDLE BECAUSE I KNOW YEH LIKE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS GOOD BY HENRY WATCH OUT AND BE A GOOD BOY
HE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH SOME NEW THOUGHTS THAT HAD LATELY COME TO HIM HE LAY DOWN ON A WIDE BUNK THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE END OF THE ROOM IN THE OTHER END CRACKER BOXES WERE MADE TO SERVE AS FURNITURE
HE ADDED WITH A MIGHTY EMPHASIS ON THE LAST FOUR WORDS
PURLED AT THE ARMY'S FEET AND AT NIGHT WHEN THE STREAM HAD BECOME OF A SORROWFUL BLACKNESS ONE COULD SEE ACROSS IT THE RED EYELIKE GLEAM OF HOSTILE CAMP FIRES SET IN THE LOW BROWS OF DISTANT HILLS ONCE
HE HAD IMAGINED PEOPLES SECURE IN THE SHADOW OF HIS EAGLE EYED PROWESS BUT AWAKE HE HAD REGARDED BATTLES AS CRIMSON BLOTCHES ON THE PAGES OF THE PAST HE HAD PUT THEM AS THINGS OF THE BYGONE WITH HIS THOUGHT IMAGES
SO THEY WERE AT LAST GOING TO FIGHT ON THE MORROW PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE A BATTLE AND HE WOULD BE IN IT FOR A TIME HE WAS OBLIGED TO LABOR TO MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE
HEADIN FOR HUDSON'S STRAITS I HAD A BAD TURN O SOME SORT O FEVER AND HAD TO STAY BELOW THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT AND WE MADE GOOD RUNS ALL WELL ON BOARD BUT ME
WHO SOMETIMES SHOT REFLECTIVELY AT THE BLUE PICKETS WHEN REPROACHED FOR THIS AFTERWARD THEY USUALLY EXPRESSED SORROW AND SWORE BY THEIR GODS THAT THE GUNS HAD EXPLODED WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION THE YOUTH ON GUARD DUTY ONE NIGHT CONVERSED ACROSS THE STREAM WITH ONE OF THEM
THE GREATER PART OF MY LIFE FORTY THREE YEARS IN ALL YOU MAY NOT THINK IT BUT I AM ABOVE EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
I WA'N'T CAUGHT ASTERN O THE LIGHTER
A GREAT BARK HE COMMANDED FOR MANY YEARS TUTTLE'S BEEHIVE THERE WAS OLD CAP'N JAMESON HE HAD NOTIONS OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE AND MADE A VERY HANDSOME LITTLE MODEL OF THE SAME
NEVERTHELESS THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD GONE TO A TOWN THAT WAS NEAR HIS MOTHER'S FARM AND HAD ENLISTED IN A COMPANY THAT WAS FORMING THERE WHEN HE HAD RETURNED HOME HIS MOTHER WAS MILKING THE BRINDLE COW FOUR OTHERS STOOD WAITING
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
EXCEPT FROM A CHEAP UNPRINCIPLED NEWSPAPER IN THE OLD DAYS A GOOD PART O THE BEST MEN HERE KNEW A HUNDRED PORTS AND SOMETHING OF THE WAY FOLKS LIVED IN THEM THEY SAW THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES
NEVER CHALLENGING HIS BELIEF IN ULTIMATE SUCCESS
MY EXPERIENCE UPON A CERTAIN OCCASION I MIGHT SAY
BUT YOU CAN'T BET ON NOTHING OF COURSE
HE WAS SWELLED WITH A TALE HE HAD HEARD FROM A RELIABLE FRIEND
SUCH WOULD BE NO MORE HE HAD SAID MEN WERE BETTER OR MORE TIMID SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION HAD EFFACED THE THROAT GRAPPLING INSTINCT OR ELSE FIRM FINANCE HELD IN CHECK THE PASSIONS
I RETURNED TO MY FIXED SEAT BEHIND THE TEACHER'S DESK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOWER PLACE OF A SCHOLAR YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE PLACE OF HONOR CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I SAID A HAPPY RURAL SEAT OF VARIOUS VIEWS
AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
HE QUOTED AS HE GAZED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE AND UP THE LONG WOODED SHORE THEN HE GLANCED AT ME AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS PLEASED AS A CHILD MY QUOTATION WAS FROM PARADISE LOST THE GREATEST OF POEMS
WHO WOULD HAVE NO SUCH STANDARDS
OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING SHOULD EVERLASTINGLY DISGRACE HIM GOOD LORD HE REPEATED IN DISMAY
ON CONCLUDING THE SENTENCE HE LAUGHED AS IF HE HAD MEANT TO AIM A JOKE THE LOUD SOLDIER ALSO GIGGLED THE TALL PRIVATE WAVED HIS HAND
A LITTLE PANIC FEAR GREW IN HIS MIND AS HIS IMAGINATION WENT FORWARD TO A FIGHT HE SAW HIDEOUS POSSIBILITIES HE CONTEMPLATED THE LURKING MENACES OF THE FUTURE
BEATING UPON IT MADE IT GLOW A LIGHT YELLOW SHADE A SMALL WINDOW SHOT AN OBLIQUE SQUARE OF WHITER LIGHT UPON THE CLUTTERED FLOOR THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE AT TIMES NEGLECTED THE CLAY CHIMNEY AND WREATHED INTO THE ROOM AND THIS FLIMSY CHIMNEY OF CLAY AND STICKS
BUT WE COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE WATER ON A BEACH BELOW IT SOUNDED LIKE THE STRANGE WARNING WAVE THAT GIVES NOTICE OF THE TURN OF THE TIDE
SAID THE OTHER WITH COLD JUDGMENT
WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD BE USED WITH TOUCHING EFFECT BUT HER WORDS DESTROYED HIS PLANS SHE HAD DOGGEDLY PEELED POTATOES AND ADDRESSED HIM AS FOLLOWS YOU WATCH OUT HENRY
FROM HIS HOME HIS YOUTHFUL EYES HAD LOOKED UPON THE WAR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WITH DISTRUST IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF A PLAY AFFAIR HE HAD LONG DESPAIRED OF WITNESSING A GREEKLIKE STRUGGLE
I DON'T WANT YEH TO EVER DO ANYTHING HENRY
TO HIS ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE HE DREW A LOUD AND ELABORATE PLAN OF A VERY BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE BLUE CLOTHED MEN SCATTERED INTO SMALL ARGUING GROUPS BETWEEN THE ROWS OF SQUAT BROWN HUTS
I VIEW IT IN ADDITION THAT A COMMUNITY NARROWS DOWN AND GROWS DREADFUL IGNORANT WHEN IT IS SHUT UP TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND GETS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE UNKINDLY WANDERING HE CEASED TO SPEAK
AND THE CREW DONE THEIR WORK BY DINT OF HARD DRIVING I BEGAN TO FIND THIS UNEXPECTED NARRATIVE A LITTLE DULL CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF SLOW CORRECTNESS THAT LACKED THE LONGSHORE HIGH FLAVOR TO WHICH I HAD GROWN USED
WHO HAD HEARD IT FROM HIS TRUSTWORTHY BROTHER ONE OF THE ORDERLIES AT DIVISION HEADQUARTERS
HE HAD BURNED SEVERAL TIMES TO ENLIST TALES OF GREAT MOVEMENTS SHOOK THE LAND THEY MIGHT NOT BE DISTINCTLY HOMERIC BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE MUCH GLORY IN THEM HE HAD READ OF MARCHES SIEGES CONFLICTS
AND HE HAD LONGED TO SEE IT ALL HIS BUSY MIND HAD DRAWN FOR HIM LARGE PICTURES EXTRAVAGANT IN COLOR LURID WITH BREATHLESS DEEDS BUT HIS MOTHER HAD DISCOURAGED HIM
AND WHEN I MADE PORT AT LAST IT WAS TOO LATE TO DELAY IN THOSE NORTHERN WATERS WITH SUCH A VESSEL AND SUCH A CREW AS I HAD
WE MADE WHAT SPEED WE COULD TO GET CLEAR OF HUDSON'S BAY AND OFF THE COAST I OWNED AN EIGHTH OF THE VESSEL AND HE OWNED A SIXTEENTH OF HER SHE WAS A FULL RIGGED SHIP CALLED THE MINERVA BUT SHE WAS GETTING OLD AND LEAKY
SOME TALKED OF GRAY BEWHISKERED HORDES WHO WERE ADVANCING WITH RELENTLESS CURSES AND CHEWING TOBACCO WITH UNSPEAKABLE VALOR TREMENDOUS BODIES OF FIERCE SOLDIERY WHO WERE SWEEPING ALONG LIKE THE HUNS OTHERS
HE HAD OF COURSE BEEN IMPATIENT UNDER THE ORDEAL OF THIS SPEECH IT HAD NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT HE EXPECTED AND HE HAD BORNE IT WITH AN AIR OF IRRITATION
IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
HE COPIED LIFE BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LOW TALK I NOW REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS TODD HAD TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE HAD OVERSET HIS MIND WITH TOO MUCH READING
BUT THEY WERE SOME ACQUAINTED WITH FOREIGN LANDS AN THEIR LAWS AN COULD SEE OUTSIDE THE BATTLE FOR TOWN CLERK HERE IN DUNNET THEY GOT SOME SENSE O PROPORTION YES THEY LIVED MORE DIGNIFIED AND THEIR HOUSES WERE BETTER WITHIN AN WITHOUT
AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED FROM LONELINESS AND MISAPPREHENSION HE LOOKED WITH HIS CAREFUL PRECISION OF DRESS AS IF HE WERE THE OBJECT OF CHERISHING CARE ON THE PART OF ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS
IT'S A LIE THAT'S ALL IT IS A THUNDERIN LIE SAID ANOTHER PRIVATE LOUDLY HIS SMOOTH FACE WAS FLUSHED
SO'S I KIN DERN EM AN ALLUS BE CAREFUL AN CHOOSE YER COMP'NY THERE'S LOTS OF BAD MEN IN THE ARMY HENRY THE ARMY MAKES EM WILD AND THEY LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN THE JOB OF LEADING OFF A YOUNG FELLER LIKE YOU
I SAID RISING TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED BOWING WITH MUCH COURTESY I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE DESK AND OFFERED HIM A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT ONCE BEING SADLY SPENT BY HIS CLIMB
WELL MY LAST CRIME WAS A CHRISTMAS CRIME A CHEERY COSY ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS CRIME A CRIME OF CHARLES DICKENS
I HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF EM COMING DOWN THEY'RE THE THREE GREAT AFRICAN DIAMONDS CALLED THE FLYING STARS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN STOLEN SO OFTEN ALL THE BIG CRIMINALS ARE ON THE TRACK
A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
HE PUT A PAPER DONKEY'S HEAD UNEXPECTEDLY ON FATHER BROWN WHO BORE IT PATIENTLY AND EVEN FOUND SOME PRIVATE MANNER OF MOVING HIS EARS HE EVEN ESSAYED TO PUT THE PAPER DONKEY'S TAIL
BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
AS ALWAYS HAPPENS THE INVENTION GREW WILDER AND WILDER THROUGH THE VERY TAMENESS OF THE BOURGEOIS CONVENTIONS FROM WHICH IT HAD TO CREATE THE COLUMBINE LOOKED CHARMING IN AN OUTSTANDING SKIRT
WENT ROUND TO THE FRONT AND SAT AMONG THE AUDIENCE WITH ALL THE SOLEMN EXPECTATION OF A CHILD AT HIS FIRST MATINEE THE SPECTATORS WERE FEW RELATIONS ONE OR TWO LOCAL FRIENDS
DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
NOW GATHERING GLOOM AGAINST A GORGEOUS VIOLET SUNSET THE SCENE THUS FRAMED WAS SO COLOURED AND QUAINT LIKE A BACK SCENE IN A PLAY THAT THEY FORGOT A MOMENT THE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE STANDING IN THE DOOR
ALMOST DANCING I'LL BE COLUMBINE AND YOU SHALL BE PANTALOON THE MILLIONAIRE HELD HIMSELF STIFF WITH A SORT OF HEATHEN SOLEMNITY I THINK MY DEAR HE SAID
ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
A SAINT SAID FATHER BROWN I THINK SAID SIR LEOPOLD WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE THAT RUBY MEANS A SOCIALIST
IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
THE FLYING STARS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIME I EVER COMMITTED FLAMBEAU WOULD SAY IN HIS HIGHLY MORAL OLD AGE
EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDISTINGUISHED ABOUT THE PRIEST EVEN DOWN TO HIS NAME WHICH WAS BROWN YET THE COLONEL HAD ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING COMPANIONABLE ABOUT HIM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED HIM TO SUCH FAMILY GATHERINGS
OF COURSE OF COURSE REPLIED THE COLONEL CARELESSLY MY DEAR CHAP ANY FRIEND OF YOURS NO DOUBT HE WILL PROVE AN ACQUISITION
HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS SHE REMONSTRATED WELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN IF YOU'RE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WALL I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S WRONG TO CLIMB OVER IT
YOU SEE AN ENGLISH INTERIOR OPEN A MOONLIT GARDEN IT ALL GOES BY MAGIC AND SNATCHING A CHANCE PIECE OF BILLIARD CHALK FROM HIS POCKET HE RAN IT ACROSS THE HALL FLOOR
HE WAS DUSTY LOOKING AND IN A FRAYED COAT EVIDENTLY A COMMON MESSENGER ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN MISTER BLOUNT HE ASKED AND HELD FORWARD A LETTER DOUBTFULLY
OH SPLENDID CRIED RUBY OH I WISH YOU'D DO IT TO THIS COMPANY THE BOISTEROUS CANADIAN MISTER BLOUNT WAS LIFTING HIS LOUD VOICE IN APPLAUSE
A HARLEQUINADE'S THE QUICKEST THING WE CAN DO FOR TWO REASONS FIRST ONE CAN GAG TO ANY DEGREE AND SECOND ALL THE OBJECTS ARE HOUSEHOLD THINGS
THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL
WHICH WAS RATHER A LONG PROCESS A LARGE NEAT CHAUFFEUR IN GREEN GOT OUT FROM THE FRONT AND A SMALL NEAT MANSERVANT IN GREY GOT OUT FROM THE BACK AND BETWEEN THEM THEY DEPOSITED SIR LEOPOLD ON THE DOORSTEP
I LIKE THE JOLLY OLD PANTOMIME WHERE A MAN SITS ON HIS TOP HAT NOT ON MINE PLEASE SAID SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER WITH DIGNITY WELL WELL OBSERVED CROOK AIRILY
THAT FAMOUS FRENCH ACROBAT AND COMIC ACTOR I KNEW HIM YEARS AGO OUT WEST HE WAS A FRENCH CANADIAN BY BIRTH AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE BUSINESS FOR ME THOUGH I HARDLY GUESS WHAT
TABLES AND TOWEL HORSES AND WASHING BASKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S TRUE ADMITTED CROOK NODDING EAGERLY AND WALKING ABOUT BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HAVE MY POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM
AND I FIND THE THING'S EXTINCT NOTHING BUT A LOT OF SNIVELLING FAIRY PLAYS I WANT A HOT POKER AND A POLICEMAN MADE INTO SAUSAGES AND THEY GIVE ME PRINCESSES MORALISING BY MOONLIGHT BLUE BIRDS
IT WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND IT IS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THE STRANGER MUST STUDY IT FROM THIS STANDPOINT THE DRAMA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WHEN THE FRONT DOORS OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STABLE
BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY

OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
WAS ALSO BY A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE MY LAST IT WAS COMMITTED AT CHRISTMAS AS AN ARTIST
HE'S A JOURNALIST AND KNOWS ALL THE OLDEST JOKES I CAN BE HARLEQUIN THAT ONLY WANTS LONG LEGS AND JUMPING ABOUT MY FRIEND FLORIAN PHONES HE'S BRINGING THE POLICE COSTUME HE'S CHANGING ON THE WAY
OH THAT'S MY GODFATHER SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER HE ALWAYS COMES ON BOXING DAY THEN AFTER AN INNOCENT PAUSE WHICH UNCONSCIOUSLY BETRAYED SOME LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
POOR THING SAID THE OLD POET AS HE WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE BOY QUITE NAKED AND THE WATER RAN DOWN FROM HIS LONG GOLDEN HAIR HE TREMBLED WITH COLD
DANCE IN THY RED SHOES TILL THOU ART PALE AND COLD TILL THY SKIN SHRIVELS UP AND THOU ART A SKELETON DANCE SHALT THOU FROM DOOR TO DOOR
WHERE SOMEONE'S ALWAYS WAITING WAITING IN THE GLOOM TO DRAW ME WITH AN EVIL EYE AND HOLD ME FAST YET THITHER DOOM WILL DRIVE ME AND HE WILL WIN AT LAST
THE CLOCK STILL TICKING IN ITS PLACE AND ALL ELSE SILENT AS THE TOMB TILL SUDDENLY I THINK A FACE GROWS FROM THE DARKNESS JUST BESIDE I TURN AND LO IT FADES AWAY
AND WAS FORCED TO DANCE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE GLOOMY WOOD THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE
I WILL TRY IT DIRECTLY AND HE BENT HIS BOW TOOK AIM AND SHOT AN ARROW AT THE OLD POET RIGHT INTO HIS HEART YOU SEE NOW THAT MY BOW WAS NOT SPOILED SAID HE LAUGHING
THE RED SHOES THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS VERY PRETTY AND DELICATE BUT IN SUMMER SHE WAS FORCED TO RUN ABOUT WITH BARE FEET
IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER
IN PRAISE OF SOLID PEOPLE THANK
L'APPRENTI SORCIER SUDDENLY THERE CAME TO ME THE MUSIC OF A MIGHTY SEA THAT ON A BARE AND IRON SHORE THUNDERED WITH A DEEPER ROAR THAN ALL THE TIDES THAT LEAP AND RUN
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
OR GO TO CHURCH TO BE CONFIRMED THERE HE IS AGAIN CLOSE BEHIND THEM YES HE IS FOREVER FOLLOWING PEOPLE AT THE PLAY HE SITS IN THE GREAT CHANDELIER AND BURNS IN BRIGHT FLAMES
AND THEN SAID TO THE CLERGYMAN HERE GIVE ME THE LITTLE GIRL I WILL ADOPT HER AND KAREN BELIEVED ALL THIS HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RED SHOES BUT THE OLD LADY THOUGHT THEY WERE HORRIBLE AND THEY WERE BURNT
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES
I LEARN YOUR WORTHINESS INDEED THE WORLD IS BETTER FOR SUCH LIFE AS STOUT SUBURBAN PEOPLE LEAD TOO OFTEN HAVE I SAT ALONE WHEN THE WET NIGHT FALLS HEAVILY AND FRETTING WINDS AROUND ME MOAN
AND JOY THAT IT BROKE
THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK
OH LET ME IN LET ME IN I AM COLD AND I'M SO WET EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY A CHILD THAT STOOD CRYING AT THE DOOR AND KNOCKING FOR ADMITTANCE WHILE THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND THE WIND MADE ALL THE WINDOWS RATTLE
SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE RED SHOES AND THEY SEEMED TO SWIM IN IT AND SHE FORGOT TO SING HER PSALM AND SHE FORGOT TO PRAY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OUT OF CHURCH
AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
AND HE CARVED OUT LITTLE WOODEN FEET FOR HER AND CRUTCHES TAUGHT HER THE PSALM CRIMINALS ALWAYS SING AND SHE KISSED THE HAND WHICH HAD WIELDED THE AXE AND WENT OVER THE HEATH
AND DOWN THE MOSS GROWN PATHS AND TERRACE NO MAN TREADS WHERE THE OLD OLD WEEDS RISE DEEP ON THE WASTE GARDEN BEDS
AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND TURNED ROUND THE WHOLE WEEK SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND WEPT MANY BITTER TEARS BUT WHEN SUNDAY RETURNED SHE SAID WELL NOW I HAVE SUFFERED AND STRUGGLED ENOUGH
AND HOMELESS LONGING VEXES ME FOR LORE THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW AND VISIONS NONE CAN HOPE TO SEE TILL BROODING WORKS UPON ME SO A CHILDISH FEAR STEALS OVER ME I LOOK AROUND THE EMPTY ROOM
THE SHOEMAKER SAID ALSO THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CHILD OF A COUNT BUT HAD NOT FITTED THAT MUST BE PATENT LEATHER SAID THE OLD LADY THEY SHINE SO YES THEY SHINE SAID KAREN
SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE
AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER
BUT STRIKE OFF MY FEET IN THE RED SHOES AND THEN SHE CONFESSED HER ENTIRE SIN AND THE EXECUTIONER STRUCK OFF HER FEET WITH THE RED SHOES BUT THE SHOES DANCED AWAY WITH THE LITTLE FEET ACROSS THE FIELD INTO THE DEEP WOOD
A LITTLE PAIR OF SHOES OUT OF OLD RED STRIPS OF CLOTH THEY WERE VERY CLUMSY BUT IT WAS A KIND THOUGHT THEY WERE MEANT FOR THE LITTLE GIRL THE LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED KAREN
HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID COME OUT COME OUT I CANNOT COME IN FOR I AM FORCED TO DANCE AND THE EXECUTIONER SAID
A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD SHE DANCED
IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH
AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE
WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE SHE DANCED
THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED ELSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED KAREN TO HAVE GONE IN RED SHOES TO BE CONFIRMED YET SUCH WAS THE CASE
AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY BUT SHE HAD NOT GOT FARTHER THAN THE CHURCHYARD GATE BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK
AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME AND THE SUN SHONE SO CLEARLY
HE HAD WINGS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO THE EARTH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SEVERE AND GRAVE AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWORD BROAD AND GLITTERING DANCE SHALT THOU SAID HE
AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART AND SHE WENT TO THE PARSONAGE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HER INTO SERVICE SHE WOULD BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS SHE SAID AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD
SAID THE SOLDIER SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES
WHO WATER FLOWERS AND ROLL THE LAWN AND SIT AN SEW AND TALK AND SMOKE AND SNORE ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER DAWN WHO PASS UNTROUBLED NIGHTS AND DAYS FULL FED AND SLEEPILY CONTENT
BUT THE OLD POET SAT WARM AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS CHIMNEY CORNER WHERE THE FIRE BLAZED AND THE ROASTING APPLE HISSED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS WILL BE WETTED TO THE SKIN SAID THE GOOD OLD POET
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
WHEN THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LECTURES HE RUNS BESIDE THEM IN A BLACK COAT AND WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO KNOW HIM
WITH US BELOW THE REAL SUN BECAUSE THE PLACE WAS FAR AWAY ABOVE BEYOND OUR HOMELY DAY NEIGHBOURING CLOSE THE FROZEN CLIME WHERE OUT OF ALL THE WOODS OF TIME AMID THE FRIGHTFUL SERAPHIM
AND WHERE PROUD VAIN CHILDREN DWELL THOU SHALT KNOCK THAT THEY MAY HEAR THEE AND TREMBLE DANCE SHALT THOU MERCY CRIED KAREN BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR THE ANGEL'S REPLY
I WILL TELL ALL CHILDREN ABOUT HIM THAT THEY MAY TAKE CARE AND NOT PLAY WITH HIM FOR HE WILL ONLY CAUSE THEM SORROW AND MANY A HEARTACHE
AND WITH STOCKINGLESS FEET SHE FOLLOWED THE POOR STRAW COFFIN IN THEM SUDDENLY A LARGE OLD CARRIAGE DROVE UP AND A LARGE OLD LADY SAT IN IT SHE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIRL FELT COMPASSION FOR HER
SHE SAW THE OLD PICTURES OF THE PREACHERS AND THE PREACHERS WIVES THE CONGREGATION SAT IN CUSHIONED SEATS AND SANG OUT OF THEIR PRAYER BOOKS FOR THE CHURCH ITSELF HAD COME TO THE POOR GIRL IN HER NARROW CHAMBER
AND THE TINTS OF HIS MANY COLORED ARROWS RAN ONE INTO THE OTHER THE OLD POET SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW ON HIS LAP HE SQUEEZED THE WATER OUT OF HIS DRIPPING HAIR
WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES
HE SHOT AN ARROW ONCE AT YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER BUT THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS ALL PAST NOW HOWEVER A THING OF THAT SORT SHE NEVER FORGETS
LEAP IN LEAP IN AND TAKE THY FILL OF ALL THE COSMIC GOOD AND ILL BE AS THE LIVING ONES THAT KNOW ENORMOUS JOY ENORMOUS WOE PAIN BEYOND THOUGHT AND FIERY BLISS
AND SET IT ON THE HIGH TREE THE FORESTER CLIMBED UP BROUGHT THE CHILD DOWN AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF YOU WILL TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU AND BRING HIM UP WITH YOUR LINA HE TOOK IT HOME THEREFORE AND THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER AND THE ONE
THE WINE UNDER THE PILLOW THE SALAD ON THE BED THE CAKES UNDER IT AND THE PARSON IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER HUSBAND AND SAID THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE BACK AGAIN
THE OTHERS WERE ALL OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO A DISTANCE AND WHEN THE PEASANT LOOKED AT THE PRIEST HE RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE MILLER'S WIFE HE SAID TO HIM I SET YOU FREE FROM THE CLOSET SET ME FREE FROM THE BARREL AT THIS SAME MOMENT UP CAME
WHICH HE HAD FOUND ON A TREE WAS CALLED FUNDEVOGEL BECAUSE A BIRD HAD CARRIED IT AWAY FUNDEVOGEL AND LINA LOVED EACH OTHER SO DEARLY THAT WHEN THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY WERE SAD NOW THE FORESTER HAD AN OLD COOK WHO ONE EVENING TOOK TWO PAILS AND BEGAN TO FETCH WATER
NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU FUNDEVOGEL SAID NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA THEN DO YOU BECOME A CHURCH AND I'LL BE THE CHANDELIER IN IT SO WHEN THE THREE SERVANTS CAME NOTHING WAS THERE BUT A CHURCH WITH A CHANDELIER IN IT
THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
AND DID NOT GO ONCE ONLY BUT MANY TIMES OUT TO THE SPRING LINA SAW THIS AND SAID LISTEN OLD SANNA WHY ARE YOU FETCHING SO MUCH WATER IF YOU WILL NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE I WILL TELL YOU WHY SO LINA SAID NO
WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP THE VERY SHEPHERD WHOM THE PEASANT KNEW HAD LONG BEEN WISHING TO BE MAYOR
LAST NIGHT OLD SANNA CARRIED SO MANY BUCKETS OF WATER INTO THE HOUSE THAT I ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS DOING THAT AND SHE SAID THAT IF I WOULD PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND SHE SAID THAT EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN FATHER WAS OUT HUNTING SHE WOULD SET THE KETTLE FULL OF WATER
THIRDLY HE SAYS THAT THERE IS SOME SALAD ON THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND WENT THERE AND FOUND THE SALAD
NO I WILL NOT DO IT IF THE WHOLE WORLD INSISTS ON IT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD HEARING THAT CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WILL NOT DO THE PEASANT SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE ME MAYOR
THROW YOU INTO IT AND BOIL YOU BUT WE WILL GET UP QUICKLY DRESS OURSELVES AND GO AWAY TOGETHER THE TWO CHILDREN THEREFORE GOT UP DRESSED THEMSELVES QUICKLY AND WENT AWAY WHEN THE WATER IN THE KETTLE WAS BOILING
AND LED THE COW HERD BEFORE THE MAYOR WHO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS CONDEMNED HIM TO GIVE THE PEASANT A COW FOR THE CALF WHICH HAD RUN AWAY AND NOW THE LITTLE PEASANT AND HIS WIFE HAD THE COW FOR WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG WISHED AND THEY WERE HEARTILY GLAD
THE DEVIL MUST GO OUT AND OPENED THE HOUSE DOOR THEN THE WOMAN WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP THE KEYS AND THE PEASANT UNLOCKED THE CLOSET THE PARSON RAN OUT AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE MILLER SAID IT WAS TRUE I SAW THE BLACK RASCAL WITH MY OWN EYES
FOURTHLY HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME CAKES UNDER THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND LOOKED THERE AND FOUND THE CAKES AND NOW THE TWO SAT DOWN TO THE TABLE TOGETHER BUT THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AND WENT TO BED AND TOOK ALL THE KEYS WITH HER
THE LITTLE PEASANT CALLED THE COW HERD IN AND SAID LOOK I HAVE A LITTLE CALF THERE BUT IT IS STILL SMALL AND HAS TO BE CARRIED THE COW HERD SAID ALL RIGHT AND TOOK IT IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE PASTURE AND SET IT AMONG THE GRASS
I NEVER HEARD THE NAME IN MY LIFE I'LL WAGER ANYTHING IT IS NOT IN THE CALENDAR THE CAT'S MOUTH SOON BEGAN TO WATER FOR SOME MORE LICKING ALL GOOD THINGS GO IN THREES SAID SHE I AM ASKED TO STAND GODMOTHER AGAIN THE CHILD IS QUITE BLACK
THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
AND RAN HOME KILLED ALL THEIR COWS AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR SKINS IN ORDER TO SELL THEM IN THE TOWN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE MAYOR HOWEVER SAID BUT MY SERVANT MUST GO FIRST
YOU HAVE DEVOURED ALL WHEN YOU WERE STANDING GODMOTHER FIRST TOP OFF THEN HALF DONE THEN WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE CRIED THE CAT
WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE

AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD ENJOY STICKING THAT DAINTY TONGUE OF YOURS OUT OF THE WINDOW THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WAY BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE POT OF FAT CERTAINLY WAS STILL IN ITS PLACE BUT IT WAS EMPTY ALAS SAID THE MOUSE NOW I SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW IT COMES TO LIGHT

AT LENGTH AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THE CAT SAID I KNOW NO PLACE WHERE IT WILL BE BETTER STORED UP THAN IN THE CHURCH FOR NO ONE DARES TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THERE WE WILL SET IT BENEATH THE ALTAR AND NOT TOUCH IT UNTIL WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF IT
THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME

YOU WILL BE MAYOR THE SHEPHERD WAS WILLING AND GOT IN AND THE PEASANT SHUT THE TOP DOWN ON HIM

THAT IS THE MOST SUSPICIOUS NAME OF ALL I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN PRINT ALL GONE WHAT CAN THAT MEAN AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD CURLED HERSELF UP AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP FROM THIS TIME FORTH NO ONE INVITED THE CAT TO BE GODMOTHER
YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
AND WELL FILLED AND FAT SHE DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL NIGHT THE MOUSE AT ONCE ASKED WHAT NAME HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE THIRD CHILD IT WILL NOT PLEASE YOU MORE THAN THE OTHERS SAID THE CAT HE IS CALLED ALL GONE ALL GONE CRIED THE MOUSE
AND THERE SAT A RAVEN WITH BROKEN WINGS AND OUT OF PITY HE TOOK HIM AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE SKIN BUT AS THE WEATHER GREW SO BAD AND THERE WAS A STORM OF RAIN AND WIND HE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND TURNED BACK TO THE MILL AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
THE MILLER WOULD HAVE LIKED MUCH TO KNOW THE FIFTH BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID FIRST WE WILL QUICKLY EAT THE FOUR THINGS FOR THE FIFTH IS SOMETHING BAD SO THEY ATE AND AFTER THAT THEY BARGAINED HOW MUCH THE MILLER WAS TO GIVE FOR THE FIFTH PROPHECY
SHE WOULD NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE AND THEN THE COOK SAID EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN THE FORESTER IS OUT HUNTING I WILL HEAT THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS BOILING IN THE KETTLE I WILL THROW IN FUNDEVOGEL AND WILL BOIL HIM IN IT EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FORESTER GOT UP AND WENT OUT HUNTING
WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
IN THE MEANTIME CAME THE PARSON THE MILLER'S WIFE RECEIVED HIM WELL AND SAID MY HUSBAND IS OUT SO WE WILL HAVE A FEAST THE PEASANT LISTENED AND WHEN HE HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT FEASTING HE WAS VEXED THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE

AND YOU LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF YES YES ANSWERED THE MOUSE BY ALL MEANS GO AND IF YOU GET ANYTHING VERY GOOD TO EAT THINK OF ME I SHOULD LIKE A DROP OF SWEET RED CHRISTENING WINE MYSELF ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS UNTRUE

FUNDEVOGEL THERE WAS ONCE A FORESTER WHO WENT INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT AND AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD A SOUND OF SCREAMING AS IF A LITTLE CHILD WERE THERE HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND AND AT LAST CAME TO A HIGH TREE AND AT THE TOP OF THIS A LITTLE CHILD WAS SITTING
OH BUT I MUST HAVE MY BEAST BACK AGAIN THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE MEADOW TOGETHER BUT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE CALF AND IT WAS GONE THE COW HERD SAID IT MUST HAVE RUN AWAY THE PEASANT HOWEVER SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT
CAN HE FORETELL ANYTHING TO ME SAID THE MILLER WHY NOT ANSWERED THE PEASANT BUT HE ONLY SAYS FOUR THINGS AND THE FIFTH HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THE MILLER WAS CURIOUS AND SAID
THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND SAID TO THE PEASANT LAY YOURSELF ON THE STRAW THERE AND GAVE HIM A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE THE PEASANT ATE IT AND LAY DOWN WITH HIS SKIN BESIDE HIM AND THE WOMAN THOUGHT HE IS TIRED AND HAS GONE TO SLEEP
THE INNOCENT LITTLE PEASANT WAS UNANIMOUSLY SENTENCED TO DEATH AND WAS TO BE ROLLED INTO THE WATER IN A BARREL PIERCED FULL OF HOLES HE WAS LED FORTH AND A PRIEST WAS BROUGHT WHO WAS TO SAY A MASS FOR HIS SOUL
THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER

OVER THE HOUSE ITSELF HE EXERCISED THE SAME IMAGINARY POWER AS OVER ITS INHABITANTS AND THEIR AFFAIRS HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT THE LENGTH OF A PIECE OF FAT

THAT'S ENOUGH WITHOUT ANY WHY OR BECAUSE EITHER REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE WITH DIGNITY WELL YOU NEEDN'T BE SO CROSS SAID HIS COMPANION A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE
REPLIED FAGIN SHOULD I HAVE TO HAND OVER SAID NOAH SLAPPING HIS BREECHES POCKET IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT REPLIED FAGIN IN A MOST DECIDED MANNER
UNSTRAPPING IT FROM THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS
AND SETTING HIMSELF DOWN AT THE NEAREST TABLE ORDERED SOMETHING TO DRINK OF THE GRINNING BARNEY A PLEASANT NIGHT SIR
RETORTED MISTER WEGG AGAIN APPROACHING DESPERATION I CAN'T SAY I DO WHY DON'T YOU LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T RETORTED MISTER WEGG APPROACHING FRENZY BUT I DON'T AT ALL
HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEN ONLY AS SOME SERVANT'S DEPUTY BUT ALSO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOUSE'S RETAINERS AND OWED VASSALAGE TO IT AND WAS BOUND TO LEAL AND LOYAL INTEREST IN IT FOR THIS REASON
SAID FAGIN MY FRIEND WANTS SOMEBODY WHO WOULD DO THAT WELL VERY MUCH WHY I DID MENTION THAT AND I SHOULDN'T MIND TURNING MY HAND TO IT SOMETIMES REJOINED MISTER CLAYPOLE SLOWLY
LIKE OVERGROWN BOYS THE WOMAN WAS YOUNG BUT OF A ROBUST AND HARDY MAKE AS SHE NEED HAVE BEEN TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY BUNDLE WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HER BACK HER COMPANION WAS NOT ENCUMBERED WITH MUCH LUGGAGE AS THERE MERELY DANGLED
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH FAGIN FOLLOWED UP THIS REMARK BY STRIKING THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER A GESTURE WHICH NOAH ATTEMPTED TO IMITATE
SAID NOAH BARNEY COMPLIED BY USHERING THEM INTO A SMALL BACK ROOM AND SETTING THE REQUIRED VIANDS BEFORE THEM HAVING DONE WHICH HE INFORMED THE TRAVELLERS THAT THEY COULD BE LODGED THAT NIGHT
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD ANSWER MY PURPOSE AIN'T THERE ANY OTHER LINE OPEN STOP SAID FAGIN LAYING HIS HAND ON NOAH'S KNEE THE KINCHIN LAY WHAT'S THAT
BLACK WATER PIPE WHICH TRAILED ITSELF OVER THE AREA DOOR INTO A DAMP STONE PASSAGE AND HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A LEECH ON THE HOUSE THAT HAD TAKEN WONDERFULLY BUT THIS WAS NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS ARRANGING IT ACCORDING TO A PLAN OF HIS OWN
POCKETS WOMEN'S RIDICULES HOUSES MAIL COACHES BANKS SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE RISING WITH THE PORTER BUT YOU CAN'T DO ALL THAT DEAR SAID CHARLOTTE
AND THE RATTLE SPRUNG SOOTH TO SAY HE WAS SO WOODEN A MAN THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN HIS WOODEN LEG NATURALLY AND RATHER SUGGESTED TO THE FANCIFUL OBSERVER THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF HIS DEVELOPMENT RECEIVED NO UNTIMELY CHECK
THE UNFOLDED CLOTHES HORSE DISPLAYED A CHOICE COLLECTION OF HALFPENNY BALLADS AND BECAME A SCREEN AND THE STOOL PLANTED WITHIN IT BECAME HIS POST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALL WEATHERS SAW THE MAN AT THE POST
BUT HAD IN THE BEGINNING DIFFIDENTLY TAKEN THE CORNER UPON WHICH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE GAVE A HOWLING CORNER IN THE WINTER TIME A DUSTY CORNER IN THE SUMMER TIME AN UNDESIRABLE CORNER AT THE BEST OF TIMES
STRANGERS REPEATED THE OLD MAN
SAID NOAH DISENGAGING HIMSELF WITH GREAT GRAVITY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF SOME BAND AND HAVE THE WHOPPING OF EM AND FOLLERING EM ABOUT UNBEKNOWN TO THEMSELVES THAT WOULD SUIT ME IF THERE WAS GOOD PROFIT
FAGIN APPEARED TO RECEIVE THIS COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT INTEREST MOUNTING A STOOL HE CAUTIOUSLY APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE PANE OF GLASS FROM WHICH SECRET POST HE COULD SEE MISTER CLAYPOLE
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE HOUSE T
SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
YOU UNDERSTAND OH YES I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED FAGIN TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
INTO NO EXPLANATION OF HIS MOTIVES AND THEY WALKED ON VERY LOVINGLY TOGETHER IN PURSUANCE OF THIS CAUTIOUS PLAN MISTER CLAYPOLE WENT ON WITHOUT HALTING UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE ANGEL
MINGLED THEIR SPICE WITH THE AROMA OF THE OTHERS THE AIR BESIDES WAS FRESH AND STIRRING AND THIS UNDER THE SHEER SUNBEAMS WAS A WONDERFUL REFRESHMENT TO OUR SENSES
HE HAD STILL A FOOT IN EITHER CAMP AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT HE WOULD PREFER WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITH THE PIRATES TO A BARE ESCAPE FROM HANGING WHICH WAS THE BEST HE HAD TO HOPE ON OUR SIDE NAY AND EVEN IF THINGS
MERRY WALKING FIRST WITH SILVER'S COMPASS TO KEEP THEM ON THE RIGHT LINE WITH SKELETON ISLAND HE HAD SAID THE TRUTH DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDED BEN GUNN DICK ALONE STILL HELD HIS BIBLE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM AS HE WENT WITH FEARFUL GLANCES
BUCK HEARD THE CHAFFERING SAW THE MONEY PASS BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENT AND KNEW THAT THE SCOTCH HALF BREED AND THE MAIL TRAIN DRIVERS WERE PASSING OUT OF HIS LIFE ON THE HEELS OF PERRAULT AND FRANCOIS AND THE OTHERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
WHEN DRIVEN WITH HIS MATES TO THE NEW OWNERS CAMP BUCK SAW A SLIPSHOD AND SLOVENLY AFFAIR TENT HALF STRETCHED DISHES UNWASHED EVERYTHING IN DISORDER ALSO HE SAW A WOMAN MERCEDES THE MEN CALLED HER
BEFORE US WAS A GREAT EXCAVATION NOT VERY RECENT FOR THE SIDES HAD FALLEN IN AND GRASS HAD SPROUTED ON THE BOTTOM IN THIS WERE THE SHAFT OF A PICK BROKEN IN TWO AND THE BOARDS OF SEVERAL PACKING CASES STREWN AROUND
THE TOP OF THE PLATEAU WAS DOTTED THICKLY WITH PINE TREES OF VARYING HEIGHT EVERY HERE AND THERE ONE OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES ROSE FORTY OR FIFTY FEET CLEAR ABOVE ITS NEIGHBOURS AND WHICH OF THESE WAS THE PARTICULAR TALL TREE OF CAPTAIN FLINT
ADJOINING ON THE NORTH THE SLOPING SOUTHERN SHOULDER OF THE SPY GLASS AND
DEARS SHE CRIED SYMPATHETICALLY WHY DON'T YOU PULL HARD THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE WHIPPED BUCK DID NOT LIKE HER BUT HE WAS FEELING TOO MISERABLE TO RESIST HER TAKING IT AS PART OF THE DAY'S MISERABLE WORK
THREW WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE FIRE WHICH BLAZED AND ROARED AGAIN OVER THIS UNUSUAL FUEL I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW MEN SO CARELESS OF THE MORROW HAND TO MOUTH IS THE ONLY WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE THEIR WAY OF DOING
OR HARDER STILL TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTOR'S LAST WARNING TO SILVER LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN YOU FIND IT AND YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE TASTE I FOUND IN MY BREAKFAST AND WITH HOW UNEASY A HEART I SET FORTH BEHIND MY CAPTORS
BUT IF EVER SPERRIT WALKED IT WOULD BE FLINT'S DEAR HEART BUT HE DIED BAD DID FLINT AYE THAT HE DID OBSERVED ANOTHER NOW HE RAGED AND NOW HE HOLLERED FOR THE RUM
KIND HEARTED CITIZENS CAUGHT THE DOGS AND GATHERED UP THE SCATTERED BELONGINGS ALSO THEY GAVE ADVICE HALF THE LOAD AND TWICE THE DOGS
AND YOU'VE GOT TO WHIP THEM TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THEM THAT'S THEIR WAY YOU ASK ANY ONE ASK ONE OF THOSE MEN MERCEDES LOOKED AT THEM IMPLORINGLY UNTOLD REPUGNANCE AT SIGHT OF PAIN WRITTEN IN HER PRETTY FACE
MUST STICK CLOSE BACK TO BACK LIKE
GIVING THE LIE TO THE LIMPLY DROOPING LIP IT CONCEALED HAL WAS A YOUNGSTER OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WITH A BIG COLT'S REVOLVER AND A HUNTING KNIFE STRAPPED ABOUT HIM ON A BELT THAT FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH CARTRIDGES THIS BELT WAS THE MOST SALIENT THING ABOUT HIM
COULD ONLY BE DECIDED ON THE SPOT
SAID HE IT'S LUCKY YOU HAVE BARBECUE TO THINK FOR YOU WITH THIS HERE HEAD I GOT WHAT I WANTED I DID SURE ENOUGH THEY HAVE THE SHIP WHERE THEY HAVE IT I DON'T KNOW YET BUT ONCE WE HIT THE TREASURE
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARNESS OF THE GOLD ALL ELSE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIS PROMISE AND THE DOCTOR'S WARNING WERE BOTH THINGS OF THE PAST AND I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOPED TO SEIZE UPON THE TREASURE FIND AND BOARD THE HISPANIOLA UNDER COVER OF NIGHT
SHE CRIED IN GENERAL AND SHE CRIED IN PARTICULAR OVER EACH DISCARDED THING SHE CLASPED HANDS ABOUT KNEES ROCKING BACK AND FORTH BROKEN HEARTEDLY
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
BUT THIS TIME FOLLOWING THE ADVICE HAL BROKE OUT THE RUNNERS WHICH HAD BEEN FROZEN TO THE SNOW THE OVERLOADED AND UNWIELDY SLED FORGED AHEAD BUCK AND HIS MATES STRUGGLING FRANTICALLY UNDER THE RAIN OF BLOWS A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD THE PATH TURNED
THREE MEN FROM A NEIGHBORING TENT CAME OUT AND LOOKED ON GRINNING AND WINKING AT ONE ANOTHER YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT SMART LOAD AS IT IS SAID ONE OF THEM AND IT'S NOT ME SHOULD TELL YOU YOUR BUSINESS BUT I WOULDN'T TOTE THAT TENT ALONG IF I WAS YOU
ERE WE WERE HALF WAY OVER LONG JOHN ALONE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND BIDDING THEM WAIT TILL THEY WERE THERE WE PULLED EASILY BY SILVER'S DIRECTIONS NOT TO WEARY THE HANDS PREMATURELY AND AFTER QUITE A LONG PASSAGE
MUST THEN HAVE RUNG WITH CRIES I THOUGHT AND EVEN WITH THE THOUGHT I COULD BELIEVE I HEARD IT RINGING STILL WE WERE NOW AT THE MARGIN OF THE THICKET HUZZA MATES ALL TOGETHER SHOUTED MERRY
THINK IT'LL RIDE ONE OF THE MEN ASKED WHY SHOULDN'T IT CHARLES DEMANDED RATHER SHORTLY OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL RIGHT THE MAN HASTENED MEEKLY TO SAY
THE PARTY SPREAD ITSELF ABROAD IN A FAN SHAPE SHOUTING AND LEAPING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE CENTRE AND A GOOD WAY BEHIND THE REST SILVER AND I FOLLOWED I TETHERED BY MY ROPE HE PLOUGHING WITH DEEP PANTS AMONG THE SLIDING GRAVEL FROM TIME TO TIME
CHARLES TURNED HIS BACK AND DREW THE LASHINGS DOWN AS WELL AS HE COULD WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST WELL AN OF COURSE THE DOGS CAN HIKE ALONG ALL DAY WITH THAT CONTRAPTION BEHIND THEM AFFIRMED A SECOND OF THE MEN CERTAINLY
WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE TO THEIR TASTE A SAILOR IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD SHOT AND BESIDES ALL THAT WHEN THEY WERE SO SHORT OF EATABLES IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD BE VERY FLUSH OF POWDER WELL THUS EQUIPPED WE ALL SET OUT EVEN THE FELLOW WITH THE BROKEN HEAD
BIT OF IT EVERY MUSCLE EVERY FIBRE EVERY CELL WAS TIRED DEAD TIRED AND THERE WAS REASON FOR IT IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES
BEN GUNN'S NOT HERE IN THE BODY ANY MORE'N FLINT BUT THE OLDER HANDS GREETED THIS REMARK WITH SCORN WHY NOBODY MINDS BEN GUNN CRIED MERRY DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDS HIM
AND THE FOREMOST BROKE INTO A RUN AND SUDDENLY NOT TEN YARDS FURTHER WE BEHELD THEM STOP A LOW CRY AROSE SILVER DOUBLED HIS PACE DIGGING AWAY WITH THE FOOT OF HIS CRUTCH LIKE ONE POSSESSED AND NEXT MOMENT HE AND I HAD COME ALSO TO A DEAD HALT
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
HE CURSED LIKE A MADMAN WHEN THE FLIES SETTLED ON HIS HOT AND SHINY COUNTENANCE HE PLUCKED FURIOUSLY AT THE LINE THAT HELD ME TO HIM AND FROM TIME TO TIME TURNED HIS EYES UPON ME WITH A DEADLY LOOK CERTAINLY HE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE HIS THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY I READ THEM LIKE PRINT
THAT THE CONGESTED MAIL WAS TAKING ON ALPINE PROPORTIONS ALSO THERE WERE OFFICIAL ORDERS FRESH BATCHES OF HUDSON BAY DOGS WERE TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE WORTHLESS FOR THE TRAIL THE WORTHLESS ONES WERE TO BE GOT RID OF
EATING AWAY WITH CAPTAIN FLINT UPON HIS SHOULDER HAD NOT A WORD OF BLAME FOR THEIR RECKLESSNESS AND THIS THE MORE SURPRISED ME FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SHOWN HIMSELF SO CUNNING AS HE DID THEN
SHE WAS CHARLES'S WIFE AND HAL'S SISTER A NICE FAMILY PARTY BUCK WATCHED THEM APPREHENSIVELY AS THEY PROCEEDED TO TAKE DOWN THE TENT AND LOAD THE SLED THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT ABOUT THEIR MANNER BUT NO BUSINESSLIKE METHOD
AND WRENCHED IT FROM HIM THE POOR DEARS NOW YOU MUST PROMISE YOU WON'T BE HARSH WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP OR I WON'T GO A STEP PRECIOUS LOT YOU KNOW ABOUT DOGS HER BROTHER SNEERED AND I WISH YOU'D LEAVE ME ALONE THEY'RE LAZY I TELL YOU
YOU CAN HELP THEM A MIGHTY LOT BY BREAKING OUT THAT SLED THE RUNNERS ARE FROZE FAST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AGAINST THE GEE POLE RIGHT AND LEFT AND BREAK IT OUT A THIRD TIME THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE
BUT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE THE HILL BEGAN TO STEEPEN AND BECOME STONY UNDER FOOT AND THE WOOD TO CHANGE ITS CHARACTER AND TO GROW IN A MORE OPEN ORDER IT WAS INDEED A MOST PLEASANT PORTION OF THE ISLAND THAT WE WERE NOW APPROACHING
IT WAS NOT THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH BRIEF AND EXCESSIVE EFFORT FROM WHICH RECOVERY IS A MATTER OF HOURS BUT IT WAS THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH THE SLOW AND PROLONGED STRENGTH DRAINAGE OF MONTHS OF TOIL
SHOUT AFTER SHOUT CAME FROM HIM AND THE OTHERS BEGAN TO RUN IN HIS DIRECTION HE CAN'T A FOUND THE TREASURE SAID OLD MORGAN HURRYING PAST US FROM THE RIGHT
WHEN ONCE MORE MERCEDES INTERFERED SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE BUCK WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
HE WAS A SEAMAN SAID GEORGE MERRY WHO BOLDER THAN THE REST HAD GONE UP CLOSE AND WAS EXAMINING THE RAGS OF CLOTHING LEASTWAYS THIS IS GOOD SEA CLOTH AYE AYE SAID SILVER LIKE ENOUGH
AND SINCE DOGS COUNT FOR LITTLE AGAINST DOLLARS THEY WERE TO BE SOLD THREE DAYS PASSED BY WHICH TIME BUCK AND HIS MATES FOUND HOW REALLY TIRED AND WEAK THEY WERE THEN ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY
JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
THE CAPSIZED SLED GROUND OVER HIM AND THE DOGS DASHED ON UP THE STREET
AND IT WAS NOW GROWN SO HOT THAT THEY COULD ONLY APPROACH IT FROM THE WINDWARD AND EVEN THERE NOT WITHOUT PRECAUTION IN THE SAME WASTEFUL SPIRIT THEY HAD COOKED I SUPPOSE THREE TIMES MORE THAN WE COULD EAT AND ONE OF THEM WITH AN EMPTY LAUGH
BY THE POWERS BEN GUNN ROARED SILVER AYE
BUT HE HAD NOT YET SURRENDERED NOBODY IN THIS HERE ISLAND EVER HEARD OF DARBY HE MUTTERED NOT ONE BUT US THAT'S HERE AND THEN MAKING A GREAT EFFORT SHIPMATES HE CRIED
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TO FIND A BISHOP HERE I RECKON BUT WHAT SORT OF A WAY IS THAT FOR BONES TO LIE TAIN'T IN NATUR INDEED ON A SECOND GLANCE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FANCY THAT THE BODY WAS IN A NATURAL POSITION
NOT FOR A DOZEN CHARLESES SHE APPEALED TO EVERYBODY AND TO EVERYTHING FINALLY WIPING HER EYES AND PROCEEDING TO CAST OUT EVEN ARTICLES OF APPAREL THAT WERE IMPERATIVE NECESSARIES AND IN HER ZEAL WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED WITH HER OWN
OF SOME AMBIGUITY THEY RAN THE READER MAY REMEMBER THUS TALL TREE SPY GLASS SHOULDER BEARING A POINT TO THE N OF N N E SKELETON ISLAND
IT'S CHILD'S PLAY TO FIND THE STUFF NOW I'VE HALF A MIND TO DINE FIRST I DON'T FEEL SHARP GROWLED MORGAN THINKIN O FLINT I THINK IT WERE AS DONE ME
E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
FOR MY PART I WAS HORRIBLY CAST DOWN SHOULD THE SCHEME HE HAD NOW SKETCHED PROVE FEASIBLE SILVER ALREADY DOUBLY A TRAITOR WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADOPT IT
AND SLOPED STEEPLY INTO THE MAIN STREET IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN EXPERIENCED MAN TO KEEP THE TOP HEAVY SLED UPRIGHT AND HAL WAS NOT SUCH A MAN AS THEY SWUNG ON THE TURN THE SLED WENT OVER SPILLING HALF ITS LOAD THROUGH THE LOOSE LASHINGS
IF I AM WELL OILED I SHALL SOON BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN YOU WILL FIND AN OIL CAN ON A SHELF IN MY COTTAGE DOROTHY AT ONCE RAN BACK TO THE COTTAGE AND FOUND THE OIL CAN AND THEN SHE RETURNED AND ASKED ANXIOUSLY
AND ARE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE FAVOR WHO ARE THE MUNCHKINS INQUIRED DOROTHY THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS LAND OF THE EAST WHERE THE WICKED WITCH RULED ARE YOU A MUNCHKIN ASKED DOROTHY NO BUT I AM THEIR FRIEND
AND HAVING READ THE WORDS ON IT ASKED IS YOUR NAME DOROTHY MY DEAR YES ANSWERED THE CHILD LOOKING UP AND DRYING HER TEARS THEN YOU MUST GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS PERHAPS OZ WILL HELP YOU WHERE IS THIS CITY ASKED DOROTHY
ONE OF THE BIG TREES HAD BEEN PARTLY CHOPPED THROUGH AND STANDING BESIDE IT WITH AN UPLIFTED AXE IN HIS HANDS WAS A MAN MADE ENTIRELY OF TIN HIS HEAD AND ARMS AND LEGS WERE JOINTED UPON HIS BODY
IF YOU WILL PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE POLE I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU DOROTHY REACHED UP BOTH ARMS AND LIFTED THE FIGURE OFF THE POLE FOR BEING STUFFED WITH STRAW IT WAS QUITE LIGHT
DOROTHY CARRIED THE SHOES INTO THE HOUSE AND PLACED THEM ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CAME OUT AGAIN TO THE MUNCHKINS AND SAID
THEN SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER FEET AND NOTICED HOW OLD AND WORN HER SHOES WERE
FIVE LITTLE FIDDLERS PLAYED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND SINGING WHILE A BIG TABLE NEAR BY WAS LOADED WITH DELICIOUS FRUITS AND NUTS PIES AND CAKES
AND HE OFTEN GROWLED IN AN UNFRIENDLY WAY AT THE SCARECROW DON'T MIND TOTO SAID DOROTHY TO HER NEW FRIEND HE NEVER BITES OH I'M NOT AFRAID REPLIED THE SCARECROW HE CAN'T HURT THE STRAW DO LET ME CARRY THAT BASKET FOR YOU
THE WITCH GAVE DOROTHY A FRIENDLY LITTLE NOD WHIRLED AROUND ON HER LEFT HEEL THREE TIMES AND STRAIGHTWAY DISAPPEARED MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF LITTLE TOTO WHO BARKED AFTER HER LOUDLY ENOUGH WHEN SHE HAD GONE
MADE A LOW BOW AND SAID IN A SWEET VOICE YOU ARE WELCOME MOST NOBLE SORCERESS TO THE LAND OF THE MUNCHKINS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR HAVING KILLED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND FOR SETTING OUR PEOPLE FREE FROM BONDAGE
SHE ATE A HEARTY BREAKFAST AND WATCHED A WEE MUNCHKIN BABY WHO PLAYED WITH TOTO AND PULLED HIS TAIL AND CROWED AND LAUGHED IN A WAY THAT GREATLY AMUSED DOROTHY TOTO WAS A FINE CURIOSITY TO ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A DOG BEFORE
AND HE THANKED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR HIS RELEASE FOR HE SEEMED A VERY POLITE CREATURE AND VERY GRATEFUL I MIGHT HAVE STOOD THERE ALWAYS IF YOU HAD NOT COME ALONG HE SAID SO YOU HAVE CERTAINLY SAVED MY LIFE
WITH TOTO TROTTING ALONG SOBERLY BEHIND HER SHE STARTED ON HER JOURNEY THERE WERE SEVERAL ROADS NEARBY BUT IT DID NOT TAKE HER LONG TO FIND THE ONE PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICKS WITHIN A SHORT TIME SHE WAS WALKING BRISKLY TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
DID YOU SPEAK ASKED THE GIRL IN WONDER CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW HOW DO YOU DO I'M PRETTY WELL THANK YOU REPLIED DOROTHY POLITELY HOW DO YOU DO I'M NOT FEELING WELL
AND WORE WELL POLISHED BOOTS WITH A DEEP ROLL OF BLUE AT THE TOPS THE MEN DOROTHY THOUGHT WERE ABOUT AS OLD AS UNCLE HENRY FOR TWO OF THEM HAD BEARDS BUT THE LITTLE WOMAN WAS DOUBTLESS MUCH OLDER HER FACE WAS COVERED WITH WRINKLES
DOROTHY HAD ONLY ONE OTHER DRESS BUT THAT HAPPENED TO BE CLEAN AND WAS HANGING ON A PEG BESIDE HER BED IT WAS GINGHAM WITH CHECKS OF WHITE AND BLUE AND ALTHOUGH THE BLUE WAS SOMEWHAT FADED WITH MANY WASHINGS IT WAS STILL A PRETTY FROCK
HER SILVER SHOES TINKLING MERRILY ON THE HARD YELLOW ROAD BED THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND THE BIRDS SANG SWEETLY AND DOROTHY DID NOT FEEL NEARLY SO BAD AS YOU MIGHT THINK A LITTLE GIRL
BUT PRESENTLY THE FIGURE NODDED ITS HEAD TO HER IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN SHE CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE FENCE AND WALKED UP TO IT WHILE TOTO RAN AROUND THE POLE AND BARKED GOOD DAY SAID THE SCARECROW IN A RATHER HUSKY VOICE
AND DOROTHY OILED THEM AND THE SCARECROW BENT THEM CAREFULLY UNTIL THEY WERE QUITE FREE FROM RUST AND AS GOOD AS NEW THE TIN WOODMAN GAVE A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND LOWERED HIS AXE WHICH HE LEANED AGAINST THE TREE THIS IS A GREAT COMFORT HE SAID
AND GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF FRIGHT THERE INDEED JUST UNDER THE CORNER OF THE GREAT BEAM THE HOUSE RESTED ON TWO FEET WERE STICKING OUT SHOD IN SILVER SHOES WITH POINTED TOES
FOR I AM SURE THEY WILL WORRY ABOUT ME CAN YOU HELP ME FIND MY WAY THE MUNCHKINS AND THE WITCH FIRST LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEN AT DOROTHY AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AT THE EAST NOT FAR FROM HERE SAID ONE
SO THAT I MIGHT NOT BECOME LONELY THERE WAS ONE OF THE MUNCHKIN GIRLS WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I SOON GREW TO LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART SHE ON HER PART PROMISED TO MARRY ME AS SOON AS I COULD EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD A BETTER HOUSE FOR HER SO I SET TO WORK HARDER THAN EVER
THE GIRL WASHED HERSELF CAREFULLY DRESSED HERSELF IN THE CLEAN GINGHAM AND TIED HER PINK SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD SHE TOOK A LITTLE BASKET AND FILLED IT WITH BREAD FROM THE CUPBOARD LAYING A WHITE CLOTH OVER THE TOP
I WAS BORN THE SON OF A WOODMAN WHO CHOPPED DOWN TREES IN THE FOREST AND SOLD THE WOOD FOR A LIVING WHEN I GREW UP I TOO BECAME A WOODCHOPPER AND AFTER MY FATHER DIED I TOOK CARE OF MY OLD MOTHER AS LONG AS SHE LIVED THEN I MADE UP MY MIND THAT INSTEAD OF LIVING ALONE I WOULD MARRY
YES INDEED ANSWERED THE LITTLE WOMAN BUT I AM A GOOD WITCH AND THE PEOPLE LOVE ME I AM NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE WICKED WITCH WAS WHO RULED HERE OR I SHOULD HAVE SET THE PEOPLE FREE MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT ALL WITCHES WERE WICKED
SHE WAS THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AS I SAID ANSWERED THE LITTLE WOMAN SHE HAS HELD ALL THE MUNCHKINS IN BONDAGE FOR MANY YEARS MAKING THEM SLAVE FOR HER NIGHT AND DAY NOW THEY ARE ALL SET FREE
THEREUPON THE WICKED WITCH ENCHANTED MY AXE AND WHEN I WAS CHOPPING AWAY AT MY BEST ONE DAY FOR I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET THE NEW HOUSE AND MY WIFE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE AXE SLIPPED ALL AT ONCE AND CUT OFF MY LEFT LEG
AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT THE SILVER SHOES SHE WAS SO OLD EXPLAINED THE WITCH OF THE NORTH THAT SHE DRIED UP QUICKLY IN THE SUN THAT IS THE END OF HER BUT THE SILVER SHOES ARE YOURS AND YOU SHALL HAVE THEM TO WEAR
MY BODY SHONE SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN THAT I FELT VERY PROUD OF IT
THERE WAS A GREAT CORNFIELD BEYOND THE FENCE AND NOT FAR AWAY SHE SAW A SCARECROW PLACED HIGH ON A POLE TO KEEP THE BIRDS FROM THE RIPE CORN DOROTHY LEANED HER CHIN UPON HER HAND AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE SCARECROW
IT MUST BE INCONVENIENT TO BE MADE OF FLESH SAID THE SCARECROW THOUGHTFULLY FOR YOU MUST SLEEP AND EAT AND DRINK HOWEVER YOU HAVE BRAINS AND IT IS WORTH A LOT OF BOTHER TO BE ABLE TO THINK PROPERLY
DO YOU THINK HE ASKED IF I GO TO THE EMERALD CITY WITH YOU THAT OZ WOULD GIVE ME SOME BRAINS I CANNOT TELL SHE RETURNED BUT YOU MAY COME WITH ME IF YOU LIKE
BUT ALAS I HAD NOW NO HEART SO THAT I LOST ALL MY LOVE FOR THE MUNCHKIN GIRL AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER I MARRIED HER OR NOT I SUPPOSE SHE IS STILL LIVING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WAITING FOR ME TO COME AFTER HER
BLUE IS THE COLOR OF THE MUNCHKINS AND WHITE IS THE WITCH COLOR SO WE KNOW YOU ARE A FRIENDLY WITCH DOROTHY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS
AND SHE KNEW VERY WELL SHE WAS ONLY AN ORDINARY LITTLE GIRL
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE SCARECROW YOU SEE HE CONTINUED CONFIDENTIALLY I DON'T MIND MY LEGS AND ARMS AND BODY BEING STUFFED BECAUSE I CANNOT GET HURT IF ANYONE TREADS ON MY TOES OR STICKS A PIN INTO ME IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR I CAN'T FEEL IT
HER TEARS SEEMED TO GRIEVE THE KIND HEARTED MUNCHKINS FOR THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS AND BEGAN TO WEEP ALSO AS FOR THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SHE TOOK OFF HER CAP AND BALANCED THE POINT ON THE END OF HER NOSE WHILE SHE COUNTED ONE TWO
DID YOU GROAN ASKED DOROTHY YES ANSWERED THE TIN MAN I DID I'VE BEEN GROANING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH REPLIED THE SCARECROW CHEERFULLY MY HEAD IS STUFFED WITH STRAW YOU KNOW
WHY I GUESS SO DOROTHY ANSWERED IT WOULD BE AS EASY AS TO GIVE THE SCARECROW BRAINS TRUE THE TIN WOODMAN RETURNED SO IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO JOIN YOUR PARTY
SO SHE BRAVELY RESOLVED NOT TO TURN BACK SHE BADE HER FRIENDS GOOD BYE AND AGAIN STARTED ALONG THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK WHEN SHE HAD GONE SEVERAL MILES SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD STOP TO REST
AND AT ITS EDGE IS THE SAME GREAT DESERT THAT SURROUNDS THIS LAND OF OZ I'M AFRAID MY DEAR YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH US DOROTHY BEGAN TO SOB AT THIS FOR SHE FELT LONELY AMONG ALL THESE STRANGE PEOPLE
THERE WERE LOVELY PATCHES OF GREENSWARD ALL ABOUT WITH STATELY TREES BEARING RICH AND LUSCIOUS FRUITS BANKS OF GORGEOUS FLOWERS WERE ON EVERY HAND AND BIRDS WITH RARE AND BRILLIANT PLUMAGE SANG AND FLUTTERED IN THE TREES AND BUSHES
THIS AT FIRST SEEMED A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I KNEW A ONE LEGGED MAN COULD NOT DO VERY WELL AS A WOOD CHOPPER SO I WENT TO A TINSMITH AND HAD HIM MAKE ME A NEW LEG OUT OF TIN THE LEG WORKED VERY WELL ONCE I WAS USED TO IT
THE MUNCHKINS WHO HAD BEEN STANDING SILENTLY BY GAVE A LOUD SHOUT AND POINTED TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE WICKED WITCH HAD BEEN LYING WHAT IS IT ASKED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AND LOOKED AND BEGAN TO LAUGH THE FEET OF THE DEAD WITCH HAD DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY
THE HOUSES OF THE MUNCHKINS WERE ODD LOOKING DWELLINGS FOR EACH WAS ROUND WITH A BIG DOME FOR A ROOF ALL WERE PAINTED BLUE FOR IN THIS COUNTRY OF THE EAST BLUE WAS THE FAVORITE COLOR
AUNT EM HAS TOLD ME THAT THE WITCHES WERE ALL DEAD YEARS AND YEARS AGO WHO IS AUNT EM INQUIRED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
ANSWERED THE WITCH SINKING HER VOICE TO A WHISPER HE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE REST OF US TOGETHER HE LIVES IN THE CITY OF EMERALDS DOROTHY WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT JUST THEN
BUT THE GIRL LIVED WITH AN OLD WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT HER TO MARRY ANYONE FOR SHE WAS SO LAZY SHE WISHED THE GIRL TO REMAIN WITH HER AND DO THE COOKING AND THE HOUSEWORK SO THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND PROMISED HER TWO SHEEP AND A COW IF SHE WOULD PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
THE RESCUE OF THE TIN WOODMAN WHEN DOROTHY AWOKE THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH THE TREES AND TOTO HAD LONG BEEN OUT CHASING BIRDS AROUND HIM AND SQUIRRELS
GET AN OIL CAN AND OIL MY JOINTS HE ANSWERED
OH DEAR OH DEAR CRIED DOROTHY CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN DISMAY THE HOUSE MUST HAVE FALLEN ON HER WHATEVER SHALL WE DO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE SAID THE LITTLE WOMAN CALMLY BUT WHO WAS SHE ASKED DOROTHY
SHE REACHED DOWN AND PICKED UP THE SHOES AND AFTER SHAKING THE DUST OUT OF THEM HANDED THEM TO DOROTHY THE WITCH OF THE EAST WAS PROUD OF THOSE SILVER SHOES SAID ONE OF THE MUNCHKINS AND THERE IS SOME CHARM CONNECTED WITH THEM BUT WHAT IT IS WE NEVER KNEW
BUT HE STOOD PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AS IF HE COULD NOT STIR AT ALL DOROTHY LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND SO DID THE SCARECROW WHILE TOTO BARKED SHARPLY AND MADE A SNAP AT THE TIN LEGS WHICH HURT HIS TEETH
THE YEAR I STOOD THERE I HAD TIME TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST LOSS I HAD KNOWN
I KNOW THIS IS TRUE FOR I AM ONE OF THEM MYSELF AND CANNOT BE MISTAKEN THOSE WHO DWELT IN THE EAST AND THE WEST WERE INDEED WICKED WITCHES BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE KILLED ONE OF THEM THERE IS BUT ONE WICKED WITCH IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ THE ONE WHO LIVES IN THE WEST
DOROTHY SAT UP AND NOTICED THAT THE HOUSE WAS NOT MOVING NOR WAS IT DARK FOR THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE CAME IN AT THE WINDOW FLOODING THE LITTLE ROOM SHE SPRANG FROM HER BED AND WITH TOTO AT HER HEELS RAN AND OPENED THE DOOR
DOROTHY LISTENED TO THIS SPEECH WITH WONDER WHAT COULD THE LITTLE WOMAN POSSIBLY MEAN BY CALLING HER A SORCERESS AND SAYING SHE HAD KILLED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST DOROTHY WAS AN INNOCENT HARMLESS LITTLE GIRL
KNOWING THAT YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING THE SAME POWER AS WE HAVE WOULD DO THE SAME AS WE DO THUS AS FAR AS THE GODS ARE CONCERNED WE HAVE NO FEAR AND NO REASON TO FEAR THAT WE SHALL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE
AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
HIS SOLDIERS TIRED OF THEIR INACTIVITY BEGAN ALSO SERIOUSLY TO REFLECT ON THE WEAKNESS AND INCOMPETENCE OF THEIR COMMANDER AND THE SKILL AND VALOUR THAT WOULD BE OPPOSED TO HIM AND ON THEIR OWN ORIGINAL UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCOMPANY HIM
HAVE THE MOST BRILLIANT NAME IN WAR THEREFORE WHILE THEIR CARELESS CONFIDENCE CONTINUES AND THEY ARE STILL THINKING AS IN MY JUDGMENT THEY ARE NOW DOING MORE OF RETREAT THAN OF MAINTAINING THEIR POSITION
AND WORD WAS BROUGHT TO CLEON WHO HAD AT THE MOMENT GONE ON TO LOOK ABOUT HIM THAT THE WHOLE OF THE ENEMY'S FORCE COULD BE SEEN IN THE TOWN AND THAT THE FEET OF HORSES AND MEN IN GREAT NUMBERS WERE VISIBLE UNDER THE GATES
CONCLUDING THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN POLLUTED BY SOME OLD OFFENCE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONSECRATION AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE OMISSION IN THE PREVIOUS PURIFICATION OF THE ISLAND WHICH AS I HAVE RELATED
HE NEVER DREAMED OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO FIGHT HIM BUT SAID THAT HE WAS RATHER GOING UP TO VIEW THE PLACE AND IF HE WAITED FOR HIS REINFORCEMENTS IT WAS NOT IN ORDER TO MAKE VICTORY SECURE IN CASE HE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ENGAGE
THAN WHEN IT COMES AS THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE THIS IF YOU ARE WELL ADVISED YOU WILL GUARD AGAINST AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT DISHONOURABLE TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST CITY IN HELLAS
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FORTUNE OF WAR IS SOMETIMES MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THE DISPROPORTION OF NUMBERS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE TO SUBMIT IS TO GIVE OURSELVES OVER TO DESPAIR
WHILE ACTION STILL PRESERVES FOR US A HOPE THAT WE MAY STAND ERECT ATHENIANS HOPE DANGER'S COMFORTER MAY BE INDULGED IN BY THOSE WHO HAVE ABUNDANT RESOURCES
LEAD THEM ON TO A POINT AT WHICH THEY BECOME SO ENSLAVED BY THE PHRASE AS IN FACT TO FALL WILFULLY INTO HOPELESS DISASTER AND INCUR DISGRACE MORE DISGRACEFUL AS THE COMPANION OF ERROR
HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
SHE SAW HER COUNTRY PLUNDERED FROM PYLOS AND CYTHERA THE HELOTS WERE DESERTING AND SHE WAS IN CONSTANT APPREHENSION THAT THOSE WHO REMAINED IN PELOPONNESE WOULD RELY UPON THOSE OUTSIDE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
AND AT FIRST REMAINED NEUTRAL AND TOOK NO PART IN THE STRUGGLE BUT AFTERWARDS UPON THE ATHENIANS USING VIOLENCE AND PLUNDERING THEIR TERRITORY ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF OPEN HOSTILITY
HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DULY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE DELIANS HAD ATRAMYTTIUM IN ASIA GIVEN THEM BY PHARNACES AND SETTLED THERE AS THEY REMOVED FROM DELOS MEANWHILE
THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE OF THE ALLIES WHO WHEN THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE SICILIANS TOOK PLACE HAD NOT MADE PEACE WITH HER
AND BROKE UP HIS CAMP AND ADVANCED THE TEMPER OF THE GENERAL WAS WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT PYLOS HIS SUCCESS ON THAT OCCASION HAVING GIVEN HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPACITY
HE RAN AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD WHERE THE TROPHY NOW STANDS AS YOU GO BY THE STEEPEST PART OF THE HILL AND FELL UPON AND ROUTED THE CENTRE OF THE ATHENIANS PANIC STRICKEN BY THEIR OWN DISORDER AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS AUDACITY
WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ISLANDERS AND WEAKER THAN OTHERS RENDERING IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN BAFFLING THE MASTERS OF THE SEA MELIANS BUT DO YOU CONSIDER
NOR INDEED WOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO NOW IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN PRESSED BY A WAR WITH THE HIPPONIANS AND MEDMAEANS WHO LIVED ON THEIR BORDER AND WERE COLONISTS OF THEIRS PHAEAX MEANWHILE
AFTER REMAINING QUIET FOR SOME TIME
WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST MELIANS AS WE THINK AT ANY RATE IT IS EXPEDIENT
AND WHO CAREFULLY CONSULTING HIS OWN MEANS MAKES HIS ATTACK NOT SO MUCH BY OPEN AND REGULAR APPROACHES AS BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE MOMENT
THE NEXT SUMMER THE TRUCE FOR A YEAR ENDED AFTER LASTING UNTIL THE PYTHIAN GAMES DURING THE ARMISTICE THE ATHENIANS EXPELLED THE DELIANS FROM DELOS
WITH HONOUR AS THE PRIZE AND SHAME AS THE PENALTY BUT A QUESTION OF SELF PRESERVATION AND OF NOT RESISTING THOSE WHO ARE FAR STRONGER THAN YOU ARE MELIANS
MELIANS IT IS NATURAL AND EXCUSABLE FOR MEN IN OUR POSITION TO TURN MORE WAYS THAN ONE BOTH IN THOUGHT AND UTTERANCE HOWEVER THE QUESTION IN THIS CONFERENCE IS AS YOU SAY
BUT THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS HAD ALREADY TAKEN TORONE
AS YOUR FALL WOULD BE A SIGNAL FOR THE HEAVIEST VENGEANCE AND AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD TO MEDITATE UPON ATHENIANS THE END OF OUR EMPIRE IF END IT SHOULD DOES NOT FRIGHTEN US
AS IF A SALLY WERE INTENDED UPON HEARING THIS HE WENT UP TO LOOK AND HAVING DONE SO BEING UNWILLING TO VENTURE UPON THE DECISIVE STEP OF A BATTLE BEFORE HIS REINFORCEMENTS CAME UP
KILLING SOME OF THE PELOPONNESIANS AND TORONAEANS IN THE MELEE AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THE REST AND PASITELIDAS THEIR COMMANDER AMONGST THEM
AND DREW A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION ROUND THE MELIANS DIVIDING THE WORK AMONG THE DIFFERENT STATES SUBSEQUENTLY THE ATHENIANS RETURNED WITH MOST OF THEIR ARMY
PROCEEDED ON HIS VOYAGE AND AT LENGTH ARRIVED AT ATHENS CLEON
THE MELIANS ATTACKED BY NIGHT AND TOOK THE PART OF THE ATHENIAN LINES OVER AGAINST THE MARKET AND KILLED SOME OF THE MEN AND BROUGHT IN CORN AND ALL ELSE THAT THEY COULD FIND USEFUL TO THEM AND SO RETURNED AND KEPT QUIET
WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE COME HERE IN THE INTEREST OF OUR EMPIRE AND THAT WE SHALL SAY WHAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO SAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF YOUR COUNTRY AS WE WOULD FAIN EXERCISE THAT EMPIRE
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF SUBMITTING BEFORE SUFFERING THE WORST AND WE SHOULD GAIN BY NOT DESTROYING YOU MELIANS SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT CONSENT TO OUR BEING NEUTRAL
HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
QUICK SOMEONE AND OPEN THE GATES I SPOKE OF AND LET US BE OUT AND AT THEM WITH NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT ACCORDINGLY ISSUING OUT BY THE PALISADE GATE AND BY THE FIRST IN THE LONG WALL THEN EXISTING
BUT IT IS FOR THIS VERY REASON THAT WE NOW TRUST TO THEIR RESPECT FOR EXPEDIENCY TO PREVENT THEM FROM BETRAYING THE MELIANS THEIR COLONISTS AND THEREBY LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN HELLAS
ARE THINGS THAT DO NOT NEED FURTHER COMMENT BUT THE PLAN OF ATTACK THAT I PROPOSE TO PURSUE THIS IT IS AS WELL TO EXPLAIN IN ORDER THAT THE FACT OF OUR ADVENTURING WITH A PART INSTEAD OF WITH THE WHOLE OF OUR FORCES
THINKING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SUCH A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM ALONE IF THEIR REINFORCEMENTS WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO COME UP AND SO CALLING ALL HIS SOLDIERS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND EXPLAIN HIS INTENTION SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
ENCAMPING IN THEIR TERRITORY WITH THE ABOVE ARMAMENT BEFORE DOING ANY HARM TO THEIR LAND SENT ENVOYS TO NEGOTIATE THESE THE MELIANS DID NOT BRING BEFORE THE PEOPLE
MELIANS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERS TO SEND THE CRETAN SEA IS A WIDE ONE AND IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO COMMAND IT TO INTERCEPT OTHERS THAN FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO ELUDE THEM TO DO SO SAFELY
AS IS LIKELY DEALING TERROR AMONG THEM TAKE WITH YOU THE AMPHIPOLITANS AND THE REST OF THE ALLIES AND SUDDENLY OPEN THE GATES AND DASH AT THEM AND HASTEN TO ENGAGE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THAT
MELIANS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FACE EVEN DANGER FOR OUR SAKE AND WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN FOR OTHERS AS OUR NEARNESS TO PELOPONNESE MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACT
WHILE THEIR SPIRIT IS SLACK AND NOT HIGH STRUNG WITH EXPECTATION I WITH THE MEN UNDER MY COMMAND WILL IF POSSIBLE TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND FALL WITH A RUN UPON THEIR CENTRE
THUS THE ATHENIAN ARMY WAS ALL NOW IN FLIGHT AND SUCH AS ESCAPED BEING KILLED IN THE BATTLE OR BY THE CHALCIDIAN HORSE AND THE TARGETEERS DISPERSED AMONG THE HILLS AND WITH DIFFICULTY
IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW THE MARKETPLACE AND THE AMPHIPOLITANS HAVING ENCLOSED HIS TOMB EVER AFTERWARDS SACRIFICE TO HIM AS A HERO AND HAVE GIVEN TO HIM THE HONOUR OF GAMES AND ANNUAL OFFERINGS
AND THAT ITS GARRISON WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM BATTLE HE ADVANCED WITH HIS ARMY AGAINST THE TOWN SENDING TEN SHIPS TO SAIL ROUND INTO THE HARBOUR
THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
WITH TWELVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AND THREE HUNDRED HORSE FROM ATHENS
ONLY WHEN THEY ARE RUINED BUT SO LONG AS THE DISCOVERY WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GUARD AGAINST IT IT IS NEVER FOUND WANTING LET NOT THIS BE THE CASE WITH YOU WHO ARE WEAK AND HANG ON A SINGLE TURN OF THE SCALE
REMAINED TO ARRANGE MATTERS AT AMPHIPOLIS
IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THE LATTER HAD FALLEN AND ONLY SEVEN OF THE ENEMY OWING TO THERE HAVING BEEN NO REGULAR ENGAGEMENT BUT THE AFFAIR OF ACCIDENT AND PANIC THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED AFTER TAKING UP THEIR DEAD THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF HOME
THIS FORT THE ADMIRAL IN THOSE DAYS OF WAITING HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION SECRETLY TO GARRISON AND REARM FOR THE PURPOSE HE HAD STRIPPED THE FORT OF COJERO FARTHER OUT ON THE GULF OF ITS ENTIRE ARMAMENT
SHOULDERS HUNCHED HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK AND MILDLY REGARDED THE BUCCANEER IN SILENCE CAHUSAC EXPLAINED HIMSELF LAST NIGHT I SEND ONE OF MY MEN TO THE SPANISH ADMIRAL WITH A LETTER
ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF NUESTRA SENORA DEL CARMEN WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD IMPIOUSLY APPROPRIATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF A CORPS DE GARDE I HAVE SAID ALREADY THAT HE WAS A PAPIST ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIM
THAT WAS THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM THEM THAT SAME EVENING BY THE SULLEN MOUTH OF CAHUSAC HIMSELF HE WELCOMED IT AND INVITED THE BRETON TO SIT DOWN AND JOIN THE COUNCIL WHICH WAS EVEN THEN DELIBERATING UPON THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED
WHAT DO WE FIND A CITY ABANDONED LIKE THE FORT A CITY OUT OF WHICH
THE CATS THEY WAIT FOR US THE CATS ARE THOSE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS OF WAR THAT HAVE COME MEANTIME AND THEY WAIT FOR US OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE NECK OF THIS LAGOON
AND SO IN THE END DESPITE ALL THAT CAHUSAC COULD SAY THE SURRENDER WAS NOT TO DON MIGUEL BUT TO PETER BLOOD THEY HAD COME INTO THE VENTURE WITH HIM THEY ASSERTED AND THEY WOULD GO OUT OF IT WITH HIM OR NOT AT ALL
AND I INTEND TO SETTLE IT TAKE YOU THAT MESSAGE BACK SO BACK TO MARACAYBO BACK TO HIS OWN HANDSOME HOUSE IN WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD ESTABLISHED HIS QUARTERS
BEHIND ENHEARTENED HIM YOU HAVE REFUSE YOU HAVE REFUSE ALREADY AND WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
THE NEAREST GAPING SCUTTLE INTO THE HOLD AND THEREUPON DIVED OVERBOARD IN HIS TURN TO BE PICKED UP PRESENTLY BY THE LONGBOAT FROM THE ARABELLA BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THE SLOOP WAS A THING OF FIRE FROM WHICH EXPLOSIONS WERE HURLING BLAZING COMBUSTIBLES
HAVING ITS NECK TOWARDS THE SEA AT MARACAYBO BEYOND THIS NECK IT WIDENS AGAIN AND THEN THE TWO LONG NARROW STRIPS OF LAND KNOWN AS THE ISLANDS OF VIGILIAS AND PALOMAS BLOCK THE CHANNEL STANDING LENGTHWISE ACROSS IT
WISH TO AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE SPANIARD'S TERMS WE SHALL NOT HINDER YOU
HIS VICTORY WAS RENDERED BARREN BY THREE LUCKY SHOTS FROM AN UNSUSPECTED BATTERY BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND BARREN MUST THEIR VICTORY REMAIN UNTIL THEY COULD REDUCE THE FORT THAT STILL REMAINED TO DEFEND THE PASSAGE
AND SO SWIFT AND PARALYZING HAD BEEN BLOOD'S STROKE BOARDED NOW AND FACED BY THE COLD STEEL OF THE BUCCANEERS
YOU CALL ME A COWARD I'LL TAKE THAT LIBERTY THE BRETON GLARED AT HIM BREATHING HARD BUT HE HAD NO MIND TO ASK SATISFACTION FOR THE INSULT HE KNEW TOO WELL THE KIND OF SATISFACTION
SURE NOW THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD INDEED BUT THERE IS CAHUSAC INSISTED DON MIGUEL THE SPANISH ADMIRAL HAVE OFFER US SAFE PASSAGE TO SEA IF WE WILL DEPART AT ONCE DO NO DAMAGE TO THE TOWN
HAD NOT PITT HER MASTER HIMSELF SEIZED THE WHIPSTAFF AND PUT THE HELM HARD OVER TO SWING HER SHARPLY OFF TO STARBOARD SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED STILL WORSE FROM THE SECOND VOLLEY THAT FOLLOWED FAST UPON THE FIRST
AS HE HELD THEM OUT IN PROTEST DEATH OF MY LIFE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOW HE CRIED HIS VOICE HUSKY AND WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR WHAT IT MIGHT BE HE RAVED ON I KNEW YOU NOT FRIGHTEN THE ADMIRAL SO EASY
HAD NOT HALF THE PERIL WITH WHICH IT WAS FRAUGHT FOR HIMSELF HE TURNED FROM CAHUSAC TO ADDRESS THE MOB OF BUCCANEERS WHO HAD SURGED NEARER TO HEAR HIM FOR HE HAD NOT TROUBLED TO RAISE HIS VOICE
HE HAD IT IN THE PESSIMISM OF WHICH CAHUSAC DID NOT ECONOMIZE EXPRESSIONS TRANSPORTED AT FIRST TO HEIGHTS OF DIZZY SATISFACTION BY THE SWIFT AND EASY VICTORY OF THEIR INFERIOR FORCE THAT MORNING
BUT SUCH WAS THE DAMAGE SHE HERSELF SUSTAINED THAT PRESENTLY COMING UNDER THE GUNS OF THE FORT SHE BEGAN TO SINK AND FINALLY SETTLED DOWN IN THE SHALLOWS WITH PART OF HER HULL ABOVE WATER THENCE SOME IN BOATS AND SOME BY SWIMMING
HIS CHOICE OF A MESSENGER WAS SHREWD THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WAS OF ALL MEN THE MOST ANXIOUS FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS CITY THE ONE MAN WHO ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WOULD PLEAD MOST FERVENTLY FOR ITS PRESERVATION AT ALL COSTS
TROUBLE ME NO MORE HE SNAPPED AT CAHUSAC WHO CAME GROWLING TO HIM AGAIN SEND WORD TO DON MIGUEL
AND LONG TONGUES OF FLAME WERE LICKING OUT TO CONSUME THE GALLEON BEATING BACK THOSE DARING SPANIARDS WHO TOO LATE
LET CAPTAIN BLOOD DO HIS WORST AT MARACAYBO THERE SHOULD BE A BITTER RECKONING FOR HIM WHEN EVENTUALLY HE DECIDED AS SOONER OR LATER DECIDE HE MUST TO COME FORTH THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WAS FLUNG INTO PANIC HE LOST HIS TEMPER
WE SAIL AT ONCE BON VOYAGE SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD
WHICH WAS COMING TO JOIN HIM FROM LA GUAYRA THEIR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS WERE ON THE LARGER OF THE TWO SLOOPS CAPTURED AT GIBRALTAR TO WHICH VESSEL WAS ASSIGNED THE LEADING PART IN CAPTAIN BLOOD'S SCHEME THEY BEGAN BY TEARING DOWN ALL BULKHEADS
NEXT THEY INCREASED BY A HALF DOZEN THE SCUTTLES IN HER DECK WHILST INTO HER HULL THEY PACKED ALL THE TAR AND PITCH AND BRIMSTONE THAT THEY COULD FIND IN THE TOWN TO WHICH THEY ADDED SIX BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER PLACED ON END LIKE GUNS
AND SOME EIGHT CANOES ABOARD OF WHICH HAD BEEN SHIPPED THE PRISONERS THE SLAVES AND MOST OF THE CAPTURED MERCHANDISE THE PRISONERS WERE ALL PINIONED AND GUARDED BY FOUR BUCCANEERS WITH MUSKETOONS
AND WHAT IS MORE THEY'VE SUCCEEDED
WOLVERSTONE LAUGHED CAHUSAC EXPLODED IN FURY
THE DISPUTE WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY HAGTHORPE WOLVERSTONE AND PITT ON THE ONE SIDE AND CAHUSAC OUT OF WHOSE UNEASINESS IT ALL AROSE ON THE OTHER BEHIND THEM IN THE SUN SCORCHED DUSTY SQUARE
TRUE WE MAKE HIM PAY BIG RANSOM FOR GIBRALTAR
THE BUCCANEERS LABOURED AND SWEATED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACTION THAT WAS TO PROCURE THEM THEIR DELIVERANCE TIME PRESSED THEY MUST STRIKE BEFORE DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA
THERE TO REFIT THE SHIPS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THE PASSAGE AND SO BACK TO MARACAYBO CAME THOSE DEFEATED VICTORS OF THAT SHORT TERRIBLE FIGHT AND IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN WANTING FURTHER TO EXASPERATE THEIR LEADER
YOUR FOOL LETTER IT HAVE SEAL THE DOOM OF US ALL HAVE YE DONE QUOTH BLOOD QUIETLY AS THE FRENCHMAN PAUSED FOR BREATH NO I HAVE NOT THEN SPARE ME THE REST IT'LL BE OF THE SAME QUALITY DEVIL A DOUBT
THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED IN THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY CAHUSAC WHICH PITT HAS CAREFULLY RECORDED IN THE COURSE OF AN ALTERCATION THAT BROKE OUT
OF REDUCING YOUR FORT AT THE COST OF SOME LIVES I WARN YOU THAT YOU MAY EXPECT NO QUARTER FROM US AND THAT I SHALL BEGIN BY LEAVING A HEAP OF ASHES WHERE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO NOW STANDS THE LETTER WRITTEN
BEDAD THEY KNEW THEIR WORLD THE OLD ROMANS HE BREATHED INTO HIS COMPANIONS AND EVEN INTO CAHUSAC SOME OF HIS OWN SPIRIT OF CONFIDENCE AND IN CONFIDENCE ALL WENT BUSILY TO WORK FOR THREE DAYS FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET
PITT TELLS US A DREADFUL KIND OF ENGLISH WHICH THE SHIPMASTER HOWEVER MAKES LITTLE ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE HIS DRESS WAS AS DISCORDANT AS HIS SPEECH IT WAS OF A KIND TO ADVERTISE HIS TRADE
WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD APPROPRIATED TO HIS OWN USES A CLOISTERED STONE QUADRANGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH A FOUNTAIN PLAYED COOLLY UNDER A TRELLIS OF VINE ORANGE TREES GREW ON TWO SIDES OF IT
THEN AT LAST ON THE FIRST OF THE EBB THEY DRIFTED SILENTLY DOWN TOWARDS THE BAR WITH ALL CANVAS FURLED SAVE ONLY THEIR SPILTSAILS WHICH SO AS TO GIVE THEM STEERING WAY WERE SPREAD TO THE FAINT BREEZE
I'LL HAVE THE FAGGOTS TO THE PLACE IN THE MORNING AND MAYBE WHEN HE SEES THE BLAZE TO MORROW NIGHT HE'LL BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT PETER BLOOD IS A MAN OF HIS WORD YE MAY GO DON FRANCISCO THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WENT OUT WITH DRAGGING FEET
IN THE ALREADY CORDIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GOVERNOR OF TORTUGA AT THE FINE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS GREEN JALOUSIED WINDOWS
IN A SPACIOUS AND LUXURIANT GARDEN TO THE EAST OF CAYONA THE CAPTAIN BECAME A VERY WELCOME GUEST
RESTING LIGHTLY ON THE PUMMEL CORRECTED THE IMPRESSION THAT AND THOSE STEELY EYES OF HIS ANNOUNCED THE ADVENTURER YOU FIND ME RIDICULOUS EH CAHUSAC SAID HE AS HE CAME TO A HALT
WAS ALMOST AS SORELY DAMAGED BY THE FIRE SHE HAD SUSTAINED FROM THE BUCCANEERS BEFORE SURRENDERING CLEARLY THEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT IN THE END THAT NOTHING REMAINED
EVEN CAHUSAC'S FRENCH FOLLOWERS WERE CARRIED OFF THEIR FEET BY THAT WAVE OF JOCULAR ENTHUSIASM UNTIL IN HIS TRUCULENT OBSTINACY CAHUSAC REMAINED THE ONLY DISSENTIENT HE WITHDREW IN MORTIFICATION
I AM LOOKING AT IT SAID CAHUSAC PISH
CAME AN ANGRY RUMBLE OF APPROVAL THE SINGLE EYE OF THE GIGANTIC WOLVERSTONE ROLLED TERRIBLY AND HE CLENCHED HIS GREAT FISTS AS IF TO STRIKE THE FRENCHMAN WHO WAS EXPOSING THEM TO MUTINY BUT CAHUSAC WAS NOT DAUNTED
AND THE APPOINTMENT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE MEN IT WAS SOME MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE OF MADEMOISELLE D'OGERON IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT THIS LITTLE FLEET AFTER SOME MINOR ADVENTURES WHICH I PASS OVER IN SILENCE
WE RETURN HERE WITH SOME TWO THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT BUT WHAT IS IT IN REALITY WILL YOU TELL ME OR SHALL I TELL YOU IT IS A PIECE OF CHEESE A PIECE OF CHEESE IN A MOUSETRAP AND WE ARE THE LITTLE MICE GODDAM AND THE CATS OH
SENDING THEM BACK IN THE CANOES WHICH WE SHALL TAKE WITH US FOR THAT PURPOSE IF YOUR EXCELLENCY SHOULD BE SO ILL ADVISED AS TO REFUSE THESE TERMS AND THEREBY IMPOSE UPON ME THE NECESSITY
LEANING LIGHTLY UPON HIS LONG EBONY CANE HIS FACE SHADED BY A BROAD PLUMED HAT THERE WAS IN HIS APPEARANCE NOTHING OF THE BUCCANEER HE HAD MUCH MORE THE AIR OF A LOUNGER
LEAVING THE OTHERS TO DELIBERATE IN PEACE NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SOUGHT CAPTAIN BLOOD AGAIN HE FOUND HIM ALONE IN THE PATIO PACING TO AND FRO HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS BREAST CAHUSAC
HAD ENCOURAGED THE OTHER TWO UNDAMAGED VESSELS TO RESISTANCE THE SPANIARDS MIGHT WELL HAVE RETRIEVED THE FORTUNES OF THE DAY BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THE SALVADOR WAS HANDICAPPED IN TRUE SPANISH FASHION BY BEING THE TREASURE SHIP OF THE FLEET
JUST AS THE SLIGHT VESSEL WENT CRASHING AND BUMPING AND SCRAPING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE FLAGSHIP WHILST RIGGING BECAME TANGLED WITH RIGGING
OFFERED MUCH RESISTANCE THE SIGHT OF THEIR ADMIRAL IN FLAMES AND THE SALVADOR DRIFTING CRIPPLED FROM THE ACTION HAD SO UTTERLY DISHEARTENED THEM THAT THEY ACCOUNTED THEMSELVES VANQUISHED AND LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS IF BY A RESOLUTE STAND THE SALVADOR
WHO THOUGH STILL YOUNG HAD ALREADY WON FAME AS A PRIVATEER COMMANDER BEFORE THE LOSS OF HIS OWN SHIP HAD DRIVEN HIM TO TAKE SERVICE UNDER BLOOD THE CAPTAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS THAT DISPUTING GROUP
THE FRENCHMAN WAS NOW PLUNGED BACK AND MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER INTO THE ABYSS OF HOPELESSNESS AND HIS MOOD INFECTED AT LEAST THE MAIN BODY OF HIS OWN FOLLOWERS IT IS THE END HE TOLD CAPTAIN BLOOD THIS TIME WE ARE CHECKMATED
AND CONCEIVING THEMSELVES ON THE POINT OF BEING BOARDED THE SPANIARDS STOOD TO ARMS TO WARD OFF THE ONSLAUGHT ITS SLOWNESS IN COMING INTRIGUED THEM
BUT OF ALL THIS I HAVE NO MEMORY I DRIFTED A DEMENTED MAN I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOUSE OF KINDLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUND ME ON THE THIRD DAY WANDERING WEEPING AND RAVING THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAINT JOHN'S WOOD
CLUNG TO A MIDDLE COURSE AND ONLY MUDDLED MATTERS THE MORE
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CUTTER FATHER OH SHE DON'T WANT NO LOOKING AT WHO BROUGHT THOSE COWS DOWN HERE JEMMY DADD HE'S A FOOL WE SHALL BE HAVING SOME OF EM GOING OVER THE CLIFF
THERE WERE STILL MANY BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS WHICH COULD STILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE OF THEIR CO OPERATION IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTRACT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE INTO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NEW MINISTRY
BUT ALSO THEIR BITTER ENMITY TOWARD REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN GENERAL THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS WERE PRESSING THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE DEMAND THAT ARMY DISCIPLINE BE RESTORED AND THE ADVANCE CONTINUED THE GREATEST PANIC PREVAILED IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES
THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
ONLY WE'RE FEARED HER LADYSHIP MIGHT THINK IT RUDE
IN APPEARANCE BETWEEN BUTCHER'S MEAT AND PICKLED CABBAGE THE SURREY PINE WOODS WERE TOO DRY HOWEVER FOR THE FESTOONS OF THE RED CLIMBER BEYOND WIMBLEDON WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LINE IN CERTAIN NURSERY GROUNDS
ALL THAT TIME I FELT A VAGUE A GROWING CRAVING TO LOOK ONCE MORE ON WHATEVER REMAINED OF THE LITTLE LIFE THAT SEEMED SO HAPPY AND BRIGHT IN MY PAST IT WAS A MERE HOPELESS DESIRE TO FEAST UPON MY MISERY THEY DISSUADED ME
THOSE RESULTS WHICH LATER CAME TO BE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY UNDER THE NAME OF KORNILOVISM WE BELIEVED THAT THE GREATEST DANGER THREATENED THE REVOLUTION IN EITHER CASE WHETHER THE DRIVE PROVED SUCCESSFUL WHICH WE DID NOT EXPECT OR MET WITH FAILURE
I REMEMBER HOW MOCKINGLY BRIGHT THE DAY SEEMED AS I WENT BACK ON MY MELANCHOLY PILGRIMAGE TO THE LITTLE HOUSE AT WOKING HOW BUSY THE STREETS AND VIVID THE MOVING LIFE ABOUT ME SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ABROAD EVERYWHERE BUSIED IN A THOUSAND ACTIVITIES
IT SLAMMED AGAIN THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN NO ONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO
WHY SIR YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN BREAKING HIS LAWS AFTER THE WAY HE HAS ROBBED YOU AND TURNED YOU FROM A REAL GENTLEMAN INTO A POOR HARD PRESSED COUNTRY SQUIRE WHO HUSH HUSH MASTER SHACKLE SAID THE TALL GENTLEMAN HUSKILY
TO DRIVE THE BOURGEOISIE OUT OF POWER AND PROMOTE THE AIMS OF THE REVOLUTION OR TO ADOPT THE POLICY OF BRIDLING THE PEOPLE BY RESORTING TO REPRESSIVE MEASURES
WERE SUCH AT THE TIME THAT THE SOVIET'S POWER AS A POLITICAL PARTY WOULD FALL NATURALLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONISTS AND THE MENSHEVIKI WE DELIBERATELY FACED THE SITUATION THANKS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REELECTIONS AT ANY TIME
I STUMBLED INTO THE HALL AND THE HOUSE FELT EMPTY THE STAIR CARPET WAS RUFFLED AND DISCOLOURED WHERE I HAD CROUCHED SOAKED TO THE SKIN FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THE NIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE
THE LAST REMARK CAME SO QUICKLY THAT THE HEARER STARTED AND MADE NO REPLY YOU SEE SIR RISDON WE MIGHT RUN THE CARGO AND STOW IT ALL UP AT MY PLACE FOR WE'VE PLENTY O ROOM
NOT A BIT SAID THE FISHER FARMER WITH A CHUCKLE YOU'RE WELCOME SQUIRE I THANK YOU MASTER SHACKLE I THANK YOU WARMLY YOU SEE HER LADYSHIP IS VERY FOND
AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
DOCTRINAIRISM OF FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR COMPROMISING WITH THE UKRAINIANS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE TOTAL IMPRESSION WAS PITIFUL IN THE EXTREME THE HOPELESS DOCTRINAIRE OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT
AND AN OPEN OFFER OF PEACE KERENSKY FLUNG THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS INTO BATTLE THIS WAS NO MERE COINCIDENCE TO BE SURE THE PROJECTORS HAD EVERYTHING PREPARED IN ADVANCE AND THE TIME OF ATTACK WAS DETERMINED NOT BY MILITARY
AND HIS ADHERENTS DID NOT ABANDON THE COALITION IDEA THEY EXPLAINED IN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THAT THE LEADING CADETS WERE INDEED DEMORALIZED BY DOCTRINAIRISM AND EVEN BY COUNTER REVOLUTIONISM BUT THAT IN THE PROVINCES
THE FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION SITUATIONS WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISORGANIZED LOCAL CLASHES WERE GROWING MORE FREQUENT THE SOCIALISTIC MINISTERS WERE EXHORTING THE MASSES TO BE PATIENT ALL DECISIONS AND MEASURES
AND LET ME HAVE YOUR BILL BY AND BY I SHOULD BE GRATIFIED ON'Y TOO GLAD SIR RISDON I WILL THINK ANY ONE'S BEEN TELLING TALES TALES BOUT US SIR RISDON
IN A BROAD SKIRTED SHABBY BROWN VELVET COAT WHO WAS DAINTILY PICKING HIS WAY CANE IN HAND OVER THE SOFT TURF OF THE FIELD
I I CANNOT MASTER SHACKLE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW
BUT BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NINETEENTH OF JUNE THERE WAS A SO CALLED PATRIOTIC DEMONSTRATION IN THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD THE NEVSKY PROSPECT
BUT SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO WHAT WAS AROUND TO MAKE HIM STOOP FROM TIME TO TIME TO PICK UP A GLISTENING WHITE TOPPED MUSHROOM
MADE MORE WEIGHTY BY THE GREATCOAT OF CAKED MUD THE VEHICLE WORE
AND HAD TO BE CHECKED NOT THE KING'S LAWS BUT THE LAWS OF THAT DUTCHMAN WHO HAS COME AND STUCK HIMSELF ON THE THRONE
AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAID WERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFE MY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS SHE GAVE A FAINT CRY I CAME SHE SAID
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
IT'S A PITY TOO THE LATTER CONTINUED SPECIALLY AS WE OFTEN HAVE SO MUCH FISH WE PUTS IT ON THE LAND
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
I YES MASTER SHACKLE SEE THE CUTTER I THINK I SAW A SMALL VESSEL LYING SOME DISTANCE OFF WITH WHITE SAILS THAT'S THE WHITE HAWK LUFF BROUGH
THE RATS TELL EM TO TAKE NO NOTICE SIR RISDON GOOD DAY SIR RISDON THAT'S SETTLED THEN
TO THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS AND MENSHEVIKI IN CONTROL OF THE SOVIET PARTIES
WHO HAD TAKEN TO FISHING OR LIKE A FISHERMAN WHO HAD TAKEN TO FARMING AND HIS NAUTICAL APPEARANCE SEEMED STRANGE TO A MAN WHO WAS LEADING A VERY MEDITATIVE GREY HORSE ATTACHED TO A HEAVY CART
ARE CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO PLAY ON THE DEMORALIZATION IN THE ARMY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS END ARE INSPIRING THE DISCOURAGED ELEMENTS WITH THE FALLACIOUS IDEA THAT THE VERY FACT OF A DRIVE CAN REHABILITATE THE ARMY
SHOUTING TO GAUNT STARING FIGURES OF DESPAIR AND FOR THE FOOD ACROSS THE CHANNEL ACROSS THE IRISH SEA ACROSS THE ATLANTIC CORN BREAD AND MEAT WERE TEARING TO OUR RELIEF ALL THE SHIPPING IN THE WORLD SEEMED GOING LONDONWARD IN THOSE DAYS
SUCH DEMANDS FREQUENTLY CAME FROM THE SO CALLED SOCIALISTIC PAPERS ALSO KERENSKY MORE AND MORE OPENLY WENT OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE CADETS AND THE CADET GENERALS WHO HAD MANIFESTED NOT ONLY THEIR HATRED OF REVOLUTION
AND A LENGTH OR TWO OF FRENCH SILK MASTER SHACKLE MASTER SHACKLE CRIED THE TALL THIN BARONET PITEOUSLY HOW CAN YOU TEMPT A POOR SUFFERING GENTLEMAN LIKE THIS
THE QUESTION OF THE MILITARY DRIVE WHICH IS BEING PLANNED FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HAVING PUT THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY WHICH DOES NOT KNOW IN THE NAME OF WHAT INTERNATIONAL ENDS IT IS CALLED UPON TO SHED ITS BLOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE IMPENDING ATTACK
FOR A SPACE I STOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS IT WAS A PAPER ON THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF A PROPHECY
BUT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THE DEMONSTRATION WAS LOST AS SOON AS IT WAS REPORTED FROM THE FRONT THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HAD ADVANCED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE WORKINGMEN AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON DEMANDED THE PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES
IT WAS ABOUT THAT MAN SAID THE OTHER DON'T SHY AT IT LIKE A HORSE AT A BLUE BOGEY IN A WINDY LANE BUT I TOLD YOU MAN LAST TIME THAT I WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THAT WRETCHED SMUGGLING DON'T CALL THINGS BY UGLY NAMES
THAT THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE AND TERESHCHENKO HAD MADE TO THE KIEV RADA DID NOT BY ANY MEANS SIGNIFY A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THIS THEREFORE DID NOT GIVE THE CADETS ANY GOOD REASON FOR LEAVING THE MINISTRY
I SAW LITTLE OF THE MISCHIEF WROUGHT BY THE MARTIANS UNTIL I REACHED WELLINGTON STREET AND THERE I SAW THE RED WEED CLAMBERING OVER THE BUTTRESSES OF WATERLOO BRIDGE AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE TOO I SAW ONE OF THE COMMON CONTRASTS OF THAT GROTESQUE TIME
APPARENTLY THEY HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY STORY FROM ME DURING THE DAYS OF MY LAPSE VERY GENTLY WHEN MY MIND WAS ASSURED AGAIN DID THEY BREAK TO ME WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED OF THE FATE OF LEATHERHEAD
IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
WHILE MASTER SHACKLE WENT ON CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF COULDN'T SAY ME NAY POOR FELLOW HALF STARVED THEY ARE SOMETIMES
AH MASTER SHACKLE I'M LOSING HEART NAY DON'T DO THAT SIR RISDON AND AS TO A FEW MUSHROOMS WHY YOU'RE WELCOME ENOUGH AND I'D OFTEN BE SENDING A CHICKEN OR A FEW EGGS OR A KIT O BUTTER
WHILE AMONG THE WORKINGMEN MUCH DISCONTENT HAD ACCUMULATED WHICH CRAVED FOR OUTWARD EXPRESSION AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE CADET MINISTERS
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN RAISING THE FLAP OF ONE OF HIS SALT BOX POCKETS I DON'T WANT TO SEE GROWLED THE OTHER AS HE STOOD PATTING THE NECK OF HIS OLD GREY HORSE BEEN TO THE CLIFF EDGE
IN VIEW OF ITS GREAT HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE WE APPEND AN EXTRACT FROM THE DOCUMENT ISSUED BY OUR PARTY IN THE ALL RUSSIAN COUNCIL OF SOVIETS ON THE THIRD OF JUNE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DRIVE
THERE'S A THREE MASTED LUGGER COMING OVER FROM USHANT AND SHE MAY BE IN TO NIGHT THERE'S SOME NICE THICK FOGS ABOUT NOW AND IT'S A QUIET SEA YOUR CELLARS ARE QUITE EMPTY I S'POSE
A MAN STANDING AT AN OPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSED I LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADED IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENING SLOWLY AS I APPROACHED
REGARDLESS OF ITS ULTIMATE MILITARY RESULTS WOULD DEAL A MORTAL BLOW TO THE REVOLUTION RESTORE THE ARMY'S FORMER DISCIPLINE AND ASSURE THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE OF A COMMANDING POSITION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT WE HOWEVER
WHEN MISTER PONTELLIER BECAME RUDE EDNA GREW INSOLENT SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP BACKWARD
YOUR BIBLE TELLS YOU SO I'M SURE I COULDN'T DO MORE THAN THAT OH YES YOU COULD LAUGHED EDNA
SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PALE AND VERY QUIET
AND NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF DISLODGING THEM AT THE SIDE WAS A HIGH FENCE ENCLOSING THE GARDEN A GATE OR DOOR OPENING UPON THE STREET WAS LOCKED EDNA RANG THE BELL AT THIS SIDE GARDEN GATE AND STOOD UPON THE BANQUETTE WAITING TO BE ADMITTED
NICE GIRLS IT'S TIME THEY WERE GETTING MARRIED MISSUS BELTHROP I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS EDNA YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO SNUB MISSUS BELTHROP WHY BELTHROP COULD BUY AND SELL US TEN TIMES OVER HIS BUSINESS IS WORTH A GOOD ROUND SUM TO ME YOU'D BETTER WRITE HER A NOTE
RICH AND TASTEFUL DRAPERIES HUNG AT DOORS AND WINDOWS THERE WERE PAINTINGS SELECTED WITH JUDGMENT AND DISCRIMINATION UPON THE WALLS THE CUT GLASS THE SILVER THE HEAVY DAMASK
HE HAD TAKEN HER PARASOL FROM HER HANDS WHILE HE SPOKE TO HER
HE WOULDN'T WANT HIS MOTHER TO KNOW AND HE BEGAN TO TALK IN A WHISPER HE WAS SCINTILLANT WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF COURSE HE COULDN'T THINK OF TELLING MISSUS PONTELLIER ALL ABOUT IT SHE BEING A WOMAN AND NOT COMPREHENDING SUCH THINGS
FLUNG IT UPON THE CARPET WHEN SHE SAW IT LYING THERE SHE STAMPED HER HEEL UPON IT STRIVING TO CRUSH IT BUT HER SMALL BOOT HEEL DID NOT MAKE AN INDENTURE NOT A MARK UPON THE LITTLE GLITTERING CIRCLET
WHICH SHE DISCOVERED BETWEEN ITS PAGES
HE REMEMBERED THE CONTENTS WHICH IN TRUTH HE RATTLED OFF VERY GLIBLY WHEN PUT TO THE TEST ONE LETTER WAS WRITTEN FROM VERA CRUZ AND THE OTHER FROM THE CITY OF MEXICO
SHE WORSHIPS HIM AND THE GROUND HE WALKS ON
GOING AND COMING AS IT SUITED HER FANCY AND SO FAR AS SHE WAS ABLE LENDING HERSELF TO ANY PASSING CAPRICE
SHE TOLD HER TO NOTICE PARTICULARLY IF A FINE LINEN HANDKERCHIEF OF MONSIEUR RATIGNOLLE'S WHICH WAS MISSING LAST WEEK HAD BEEN RETURNED
WHEN IT DID NOT SEEM WORTH WHILE TO BE GLAD OR SORRY TO BE ALIVE OR DEAD WHEN LIFE APPEARED TO HER LIKE A GROTESQUE PANDEMONIUM
SHE COULD SEE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND DEFECTS WHICH WERE GLARING IN HER EYES
HE ENTREATED HER TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE DISCLOSURES OF THE AFTERNOON WERE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL SHE LAUGHED AND BANTERED HIM A LITTLE REMEMBERING TOO LATE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED
I'M GOING TO GET MY DINNER AT THE CLUB GOOD NIGHT HE WENT INTO THE HALL TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK FROM THE STAND AND LEFT THE HOUSE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH SUCH SCENES THEY HAD OFTEN MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY
WHERE HAD THEY MET ON CARONDELET STREET IN THE MORNING THEY HAD GONE IN AND HAD A DRINK AND A CIGAR TOGETHER
FINALLY SHE GATHERED TOGETHER A FEW OF THE SKETCHES
BUT I WOULDN'T GIVE MYSELF I CAN'T MAKE IT MORE CLEAR IT'S ONLY SOMETHING WHICH I AM BEGINNING TO COMPREHEND WHICH IS REVEALING ITSELF TO ME
THE BOYS WERE BEING PUT TO BED THE PATTER OF THEIR BARE ESCAPING FEET COULD BE HEARD OCCASIONALLY AS WELL AS THE PURSUING VOICE OF THE QUADROON LIFTED IN MILD PROTEST AND ENTREATY
THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE WAS HAPPY TO BE ALIVE AND BREATHING WHEN HER WHOLE BEING SEEMED TO BE ONE WITH THE SUNLIGHT THE COLOR THE ODORS THE LUXURIANT WARMTH OF SOME PERFECT SOUTHERN DAY
THEN HOLDING THEM AT ARM'S LENGTH NARROWING HER EYES AND DROPPING HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE SURELY THIS BAVARIAN PEASANT IS WORTHY OF FRAMING AND THIS BASKET OF APPLES
THEY NEED LOOKING AFTER LIKE ANY OTHER CLASS OF PERSONS THAT YOU EMPLOY
BUT THE VOICES WERE NOT SOOTHING THAT CAME TO HER FROM THE DARKNESS AND THE SKY ABOVE AND THE STARS THEY JEERED AND SOUNDED MOURNFUL NOTES WITHOUT PROMISE DEVOID EVEN OF HOPE SHE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO
HIS WIFE WAS KEENLY INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING HE SAID LAYING DOWN HER FORK THE BETTER TO LISTEN
VALUELESS THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NOT ALONE DECIDED BUT DETERMINED BUT SHE SOUGHT THE WORDS OF PRAISE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WOULD HELP HER TO PUT HEART INTO HER VENTURE YOUR TALENT IS IMMENSE DEAR NONSENSE PROTESTED EDNA WELL PLEASED
EDNA TAPPED HER FOOT IMPATIENTLY AND WONDERED WHY THE CHILDREN PERSISTED IN PLAYING IN THE SUN WHEN THEY MIGHT BE UNDER THE TREES
IN TRUTH HE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW HER AT ALL OR ANYTHING CONCERNING HER THE MOST DISAGREEABLE AND UNPOPULAR
AND KEEP THE BAREST PITTANCE FOR HIMSELF FAVORITE SON INDEED I MISS THE POOR FELLOW MYSELF MY DEAR
THIS SOUP IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT'S STRANGE THAT WOMAN HASN'T LEARNED YET TO MAKE A DECENT SOUP ANY FREE LUNCH STAND IN TOWN SERVES A BETTER ONE WAS MISSUS BELTHROP HERE
HAD MISSUS PONTELLIER EVER KNOWN SUCH A WARM NOVEMBER
ALL THE MYSTERY AND WITCHERY OF THE NIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE GATHERED THERE AMID THE PERFUMES AND THE DUSKY AND TORTUOUS OUTLINES OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE SHE WAS SEEKING HERSELF AND FINDING HERSELF IN JUST SUCH SWEET HALF DARKNESS WHICH MET HER MOODS
SHE LIKED THEN TO WANDER ALONE INTO STRANGE AND UNFAMILIAR PLACES SHE DISCOVERED MANY A SUNNY SLEEPY CORNER FASHIONED TO DREAM IN AND SHE FOUND IT GOOD TO DREAM AND TO BE ALONE AND UNMOLESTED THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY
FOR SOME REASON SHE FELT DEPRESSED ALMOST UNHAPPY SHE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO INTO THE WATER BUT SHE DONNED HER BATHING SUIT AND LEFT MADEMOISELLE ALONE SEATED UNDER THE SHADE OF THE CHILDREN'S TENT THE WATER WAS GROWING COOLER AS THE SEASON ADVANCED
AND THAT WAS HE ALSO IN KILTS AT THE AGE OF FIVE WEARING LONG CURLS AND HOLDING A WHIP IN HIS HAND IT MADE EDNA LAUGH AND SHE LAUGHED TOO AT THE PORTRAIT IN HIS FIRST LONG TROUSERS WHILE ANOTHER INTERESTED HER
TO LISTEN WHILE SHE PLAYED UPON THE PIANO QUITE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON SHE STARTED UPON HER QUEST FOR THE PIANIST
WHOSE ROUND FLUTED COLUMNS SUPPORTED THE SLOPING ROOF THE HOUSE WAS PAINTED A DAZZLING WHITE THE OUTSIDE SHUTTERS OR JALOUSIES WERE GREEN
EDNA DID NOT WISH TO ENTER IT WAS VERY PLEASANT THERE ON THE SIDE PORCH
SHE SOMEHOW FELT LIKE A CONFEDERATE IN CRIME AND TRIED TO LOOK SEVERE AND DISAPPROVING
IT WAS A LARGE BEAUTIFUL ROOM RICH AND PICTURESQUE IN THE SOFT DIM LIGHT WHICH THE MAID HAD TURNED LOW
MADAME LAFORCE
DID NOT GREATLY MISS HER YOUNG FRIEND OH GOOD MORNING MADEMOISELLE IS IT YOU
SHE SEATED HERSELF FOR SHE WAS TIRED FROM HER LONG TRAMP AND SHE BEGAN TO ROCK GENTLY AND SMOOTH OUT THE FOLDS OF HER SILK PARASOL
IN FACT THEY KNEW NOTHING OF ANY OF THEIR NEIGHBORS THEIR LODGERS WERE ALL PEOPLE OF THE HIGHEST DISTINCTION THEY ASSURED EDNA SHE DID NOT LINGER TO DISCUSS CLASS DISTINCTIONS WITH MADAME POUPONNE
THE BOY RETIRED AND RETURNED AFTER A MOMENT BRINGING THE TINY SILVER TRAY WHICH WAS COVERED WITH LADIES VISITING CARDS HE HANDED IT TO MISSUS PONTELLIER GIVE IT TO MISTER PONTELLIER SHE SAID
SHE WAS WORKING WITH GREAT ENERGY AND INTEREST WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING HOWEVER WHICH SATISFIED HER EVEN IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE FOR A TIME SHE HAD THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD ENROLLED IN THE SERVICE OF ART THE BOYS POSED FOR HER
AS EDNA SEATED HERSELF AT TABLE WITH THEM SHE THOUGHT
THE WOMAN SEEMED TO ECHO THE THOUGHT WHICH WAS EVER IN EDNA'S MIND OR BETTER THE FEELING WHICH CONSTANTLY POSSESSED HER
THE RATIGNOLLES UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY
BUT FOR THE TIMELY APPEARANCE OF MADAME LEBRUN THAT LADY WAS STILL CLAD IN WHITE ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM OF THE SUMMER HER EYES BEAMED AN EFFUSIVE WELCOME WOULD NOT MISSUS PONTELLIER GO INSIDE
THE BOYS WERE DRAGGING ALONG THE BANQUETTE A SMALL EXPRESS WAGON WHICH THEY HAD FILLED WITH BLOCKS AND STICKS THE QUADROON WAS FOLLOWING THEM
THERE WERE A FEW FRECKLES ON HER FACE AND A SMALL DARK MOLE NEAR THE UNDER LIP AND ONE ON THE TEMPLE HALF HIDDEN IN HER HAIR
MISTER PONTELLIER SCANNED THE NAMES OF HIS WIFE'S CALLERS READING SOME OF THEM ALOUD WITH COMMENTS AS HE READ
EXPLAINED MADAME LEBRUN SHE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM WRITTEN BEFORE HE LEFT NEW ORLEANS EDNA WISHED TO SEE THE LETTER AND MADAME LEBRUN TOLD HER TO LOOK FOR IT EITHER ON THE TABLE OR THE DRESSER
AND SHE ALSO KNEW WHERE THE LEBRUNS LIVED ON CHARTRES STREET THEIR HOME FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKED LIKE A PRISON WITH IRON BARS BEFORE THE DOOR AND LOWER WINDOWS
EDNA COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK THAT IT WAS VERY FOOLISH VERY CHILDISH TO HAVE STAMPED UPON HER WEDDING RING AND SMASHED THE CRYSTAL VASE UPON THE TILES SHE WAS VISITED BY NO MORE OUTBURSTS MOVING HER TO SUCH FUTILE EXPEDIENTS
AND DISCOVERED IN SOME CORNER AN OLD FAMILY ALBUM
PERHAPS I SHAN'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT THEN IN GOD'S NAME PAINT BUT DON'T LET THE FAMILY GO TO THE DEVIL THERE'S MADAME RATIGNOLLE BECAUSE SHE KEEPS UP HER MUSIC SHE DOESN'T LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO TO CHAOS
THAT WERE SCATTERED UPON THE CARPET AND HERE'S YOUR RING MA'AM UNDER THE CHAIR EDNA HELD OUT HER HAND AND TAKING THE RING SLIPPED IT UPON HER FINGER
OR EVER EXPECTED TO FEEL SHE HAD ALL HER LIFE LONG BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HARBOR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS WHICH NEVER VOICED THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEVER TAKEN THE FORM OF STRUGGLES
A MAID IN WHITE FLUTED CAP OFFERED THE CALLERS LIQUEUR COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE AS THEY MIGHT DESIRE
MISTER PONTELLIER WAS VERY FOND OF WALKING ABOUT HIS HOUSE EXAMINING ITS VARIOUS APPOINTMENTS AND DETAILS TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS AMISS HE GREATLY VALUED HIS POSSESSIONS CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS AND DERIVED GENUINE PLEASURE FROM CONTEMPLATING A PAINTING
TAKEN WHEN HE LEFT FOR COLLEGE LOOKING THIN LONG FACED WITH EYES FULL OF FIRE AMBITION AND GREAT INTENTIONS BUT THERE WAS NO RECENT PICTURE
HER FAVORITE SON OH DEAR
GAVE HER NO REGRET NO LONGING IT WAS NOT A CONDITION OF LIFE WHICH FITTED HER AND SHE COULD SEE IN IT
HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS UNBOUNDED AND IT WAS MATCHED BY HIS GOODNESS OF HEART HIS BROAD CHARITY AND COMMON SENSE HE AND HIS WIFE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WAS ONLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH ITS UN
SHE BEGAN TO DO AS SHE LIKED AND TO FEEL AS SHE LIKED SHE COMPLETELY ABANDONED HER TUESDAYS AT HOME AND DID NOT RETURN THE VISITS OF THOSE WHO HAD CALLED UPON HER
SHE WAS MOVED BY A KIND OF COMMISERATION FOR MADAME RATIGNOLLE A PITY FOR THAT COLORLESS EXISTENCE WHICH NEVER UPLIFTED ITS POSSESSOR BEYOND THE REGION OF BLIND CONTENTMENT IN WHICH NO MOMENT OF ANGUISH EVER VISITED HER SOUL
ONE MIGHT ALMOST BE TEMPTED TO REACH OUT A HAND AND TAKE ONE EDNA COULD NOT CONTROL A FEELING WHICH BORDERED UPON COMPLACENCY AT HER FRIEND'S PRAISE EVEN REALIZING AS SHE DID ITS TRUE WORTH
A FRUIT VENDER WAS CRYING HIS WARES IN THE STREET
LIKELY TO DO SO SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO ASK MADAME RATIGNOLLE WHO WAS ON THE MOST DISTANT TERMS WITH THE MUSICIAN
SHE WENT UP IN THE MORNINGS TO MADAME LEBRUN'S ROOM
BUT THE HOUSEMAID TOO SERVED HER TERM AS MODEL WHEN EDNA PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN'S BACK AND SHOULDERS WERE MOLDED ON CLASSIC LINES AND THAT HER HAIR LOOSENED FROM ITS CONFINING CAP BECAME AN INSPIRATION WHILE EDNA WORKED SHE SOMETIMES SANG LOW THE LITTLE AIR
MISSUS ELEANOR BOLTONS HE PUSHED THE CARDS ASIDE MERCY EXCLAIMED EDNA WHO HAD BEEN FUMING
WHO APPRECIATED THE GIFT FAR BEYOND ITS VALUE AND PROUDLY EXHIBITED THE PICTURES TO HER HUSBAND
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HE HAD GONE
SIMPLE CHOICE AND IN EVERY WAY SATISFYING
HE COMES TO SEE ME OFTEN IN THE CITY
HIS MOTHER WOULD FIND IT IN HIS ROOM AMONG OTHER BOOKS THERE ON THE TABLE EDNA EXPERIENCED A PANG OF JEALOUSY BECAUSE HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS MOTHER RATHER THAN TO HER EVERY ONE SEEMED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE MISSED HIM
THEY'D SOON MAKE A NICE MESS OF ME AND MY BUSINESS
THAT VICTOR HANGING WOULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HIM
SHE FELT NO INTEREST IN ANYTHING ABOUT HER THE STREET THE CHILDREN THE FRUIT VENDER
AND CLEARHEADEDNESS HIS FAMILY LIVED IN COMMODIOUS APARTMENTS OVER THE STORE HAVING AN ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE WITHIN THE PORTE COCHERE THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH EDNA THOUGHT VERY FRENCH VERY FOREIGN ABOUT THEIR WHOLE MANNER OF LIVING IN THE LARGE AND PLEASANT SALON
AND ON THEIR LEFT THE REST OF ACARNANIA
SOME EVEN TURNED TO THE SEA WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND SEEING THE ATHENIAN SHIPS COASTING ALONGSHORE JUST WHILE THE ACTION WAS GOING ON SWAM OFF TO THEM THINKING IT BETTER IN THE PANIC THEY WERE IN TO PERISH IF PERISH THEY MUST BY THE HANDS OF THE ATHENIANS
FIRST THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE MYONIANS WHO HELD THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE PASSES
FOR OF ONE PARTY THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NOTHING LEFT MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF TO SICILY THEIR PRIMARY DESTINATION AND CARRIED ON THE WAR WITH THEIR ALLIES THERE
AND AN EARTHQUAKE THREW DOWN PART OF THE WALL THE TOWN HALL AND A FEW OTHER BUILDINGS THE CAUSE IN MY OPINION OF THIS PHENOMENON MUST BE SOUGHT IN THE EARTHQUAKE AT THE POINT WHERE ITS SHOCK HAS BEEN THE MOST VIOLENT THE SEA IS DRIVEN BACK AND SUDDENLY RECOILING WITH REDOUBLED FORCE
HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETED EURYLOCHUS LODGED THE HOSTAGES IN KYTINIUM IN DORIS AND ADVANCED UPON NAUPACTUS THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE LOCRIANS
ALL THE WOMEN TAKEN IN THE STRONGHOLD WERE SOLD AS SLAVES IN THIS WAY THE CORCYRAEANS OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE DESTROYED BY THE COMMONS AND SO AFTER TERRIBLE EXCESSES THE PARTY STRIFE CAME TO AN END
AND WITH STRIPS MADE FROM THEIR CLOTHING ADOPTING IN SHORT EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SELF DESTRUCTION
AFTER CELEBRATING THE DELIAN DANCE OF THE WOMEN HE ENDS HIS SONG OF PRAISE WITH THESE VERSES IN WHICH HE ALSO ALLUDES TO HIMSELF WELL MAY APOLLO KEEP YOU ALL AND SO SWEETHEARTS GOOD BYE YET
INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
IN HIERA THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PARTS BELIEVE THAT HEPHAESTUS HAS HIS FORGE FROM THE QUANTITY OF FLAME WHICH THEY SEE IT SEND OUT BY NIGHT AND OF SMOKE BY DAY THESE ISLANDS LIE OFF THE COAST OF THE SICELS AND MESSINESE AND WERE ALLIES OF THE SYRACUSANS
AND AUTOCLES SON OF TOLMAEUS CYTHERA IS AN ISLAND LYING OFF LACONIA OPPOSITE MALEA THE INHABITANTS ARE LACEDAEMONIANS OF THE CLASS OF THE PERIOECI AND AN OFFICER CALLED THE JUDGE OF CYTHERA WENT OVER TO THE PLACE ANNUALLY FROM SPARTA
WHO HEARD THERE OF THE DEATH OF KING ARTAXERXES SON OF XERXES WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THAT TIME AND SO RETURNED HOME THE SAME WINTER THE CHIANS PULLED DOWN THEIR NEW WALL AT THE COMMAND OF THE ATHENIANS
WHEN THE ACARNANIANS FROM THE AMBUSCADE SET UPON THEM FROM BEHIND AND BROKE THEM AT THE FIRST ATTACK WITHOUT THEIR STAYING TO RESIST
ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE ATHENIANS ON THE COAST OF SICILY SAILED TO LOCRIS
NOT INDEED THE WHOLE ISLAND BUT AS MUCH OF IT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE TEMPLE ALL OF IT WAS HOWEVER NOW PURIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY
AT LAST HOWEVER SOMEONE OPENED THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH UPON WHICH THEY CALLED UPON THE ATHENIANS TO KILL THEM THEMSELVES IF SUCH WAS THEIR PLEASURE AND REFUSED ANY LONGER TO GO OUT OF THE BUILDING AND SAID THEY WOULD DO ALL THEY COULD TO PREVENT ANY ONE COMING IN
CAUSES THE INUNDATION WITHOUT AN EARTHQUAKE I DO NOT SEE HOW SUCH AN ACCIDENT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE SAME SUMMER DIFFERENT OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON BY THE DIFFERENT BELLIGERENTS IN SICILY BY THE SICELIOTS THEMSELVES AGAINST EACH OTHER AND BY THE ATHENIANS AND THEIR ALLIES
FINDING THAT THIS FORCE HAD ENTERED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STORM THE TOWN WITHDREW NOT TO PELOPONNESE BUT TO THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED AEOLIS AND NOW CALYDON AND PLEURON AND TO THE PLACES IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROSCHIUM IN AETOLIA
WHO HAD CROSSED OVER AS I HAVE MENTIONED AFTER THE REVOLUTION AND BECOME MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY TO THE GREAT HURT OF THE INHABITANTS THEIR STRONGHOLD HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY AN ATTACK THE GARRISON TOOK REFUGE IN A BODY UPON SOME HIGH GROUND AND THERE CAPITULATED AGREEING TO GIVE UP THEIR MERCENARY AUXILIARIES
KNOWING NOTHING OF THE DISASTER AND FANCYING THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF THEIR OWN PARTY SOME ONE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS SO ASTONISHED AT AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN KILLED FANCYING IN HIS TURN THAT THIS WAS THE HERALD FROM THE TROOPS AT IDOMENE HE REPLIED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
AND THE ACARNANIANS THEMSELVES SENDING SETTLERS FROM ALL PARTS OF ACARNANIA OCCUPIED THE PLACE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
WISHING TO REDUCE THE MELIANS WHO ALTHOUGH ISLANDERS REFUSED TO BE SUBJECTS OF ATHENS OR EVEN TO JOIN HER CONFEDERACY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND NOT PROCURING THEIR SUBMISSION
MEANWHILE PYTHODORUS HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF LACHES SHIPS AND TOWARDS THE END OF WINTER SAILED AGAINST THE LOCRIAN FORT WHICH LACHES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN AND RETURNED AFTER BEING DEFEATED IN BATTLE BY THE LOCRIANS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THIS SPRING
WHILE MEN CARRYING WHIPS WENT BY THEIR SIDE AND HASTENED ON THE ROAD THOSE THAT WALKED TOO SLOWLY AS MANY AS SIXTY MEN WERE TAKEN OUT AND KILLED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING WHO FANCIED THEY WERE MERELY BEING MOVED FROM ONE PRISON TO ANOTHER
THE SAME SUMMER THE AETOLIANS WHO BEFORE THE ATHENIAN EXPEDITION HAD SENT AN EMBASSY TO CORINTH AND LACEDAEMON COMPOSED OF TOLOPHUS AN OPHIONIAN
AND BY THE ZACYNTHIANS AND CEPHALLENIANS AND FIFTEEN SHIPS FROM CORCYRA WHILE THE LEUCADIANS WITNESSED THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND WITHOUT AND WITHIN THE ISTHMUS UPON WHICH THE TOWN OF LEUCAS AND THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO STAND WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE OVERWHELMING NUMBERS OF THE ENEMY
LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE THE GENERALS CARRIED THEM ACROSS UNDER TRUCE TO THE ISLAND OF PTYCHIA
WHEN THE HERALD HEARD THIS AND KNEW THAT THE REINFORCEMENT FROM THE CITY HAD BEEN DESTROYED HE BROKE INTO WAILING AND STUNNED AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PRESENT EVILS WENT AWAY AT ONCE WITHOUT HAVING PERFORMED HIS ERRAND OR AGAIN ASKING FOR THE DEAD BODIES
WHILE THEY ALSO SENT FOR DEMOSTHENES THE COMMANDER OF THE AETOLIAN EXPEDITION TO BE THEIR LEADER AND FOR THE TWENTY ATHENIAN SHIPS THAT WERE CRUISING OFF PELOPONNESE UNDER THE COMMAND OF ARISTOTLE SON OF TIMOCRATES AND HIEROPHON SON OF ANTIMNESTUS
AFTER FIRST HOWEVER OBTAINING PLEDGES FROM THE ATHENIANS AND SECURITY AS FAR AS THIS WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR CONTINUING TO TREAT THEM AS BEFORE THUS THE WINTER ENDED AND WITH IT ENDED THE SEVENTH YEAR OF THIS WAR OF WHICH THUCYDIDES IS THE HISTORIAN
THE BOMIENSIANS AND CALLIENSIANS WHO EXTEND TOWARDS THE MALIAN GULF BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE MESSENIANS HOWEVER ADHERED TO THEIR ORIGINAL ADVICE ASSURING DEMOSTHENES THAT THE AETOLIANS WERE AN EASY CONQUEST THEY URGED HIM TO PUSH ON AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
THE NUMBER THUS SLAIN WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THE REST ESCAPED INTO THE BORDERING TERRITORY OF AGRAEA AND FOUND REFUGE WITH SALYNTHIUS THE FRIENDLY KING OF THE AGRAEANS MEANWHILE THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY ARRIVED AT IDOMENE
AS TRAITORS AND SELF SEEKERS WHILE THE ENEMY WAS TAKING UP HIS DEAD AND HASTILY BURYING THEM AS HE COULD AND THOSE WHO OBTAINED PERMISSION WERE SECRETLY PLANNING THEIR RETREAT WORD WAS BROUGHT TO DEMOSTHENES AND THE ACARNANIANS THAT THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY
AND ENTERED A FRIENDLY COUNTRY THAT OF THE AGRAEANS
THE NEXT SUMMER THE PELOPONNESIANS AND THEIR ALLIES SET OUT TO INVADE ATTICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGIS SON OF ARCHIDAMUS AND WENT AS FAR AS THE ISTHMUS BUT NUMEROUS EARTHQUAKES OCCURRING TURNED BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE INVASION TAKING PLACE
THE AMBRACIOTS AND SUCH OF THE REST AS HAD ACCOMPANIED THEM IN LARGER PARTIES SEEING THEM GOING ON PUSHED ON IN THEIR TURN AND BEGAN RUNNING IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM UP THE ACARNANIANS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT ALL ALIKE WERE DEPARTING WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BEGAN TO PURSUE THE PELOPONNESIANS
INDEED THIS WAS BY FAR THE GREATEST DISASTER THAT BEFELL ANY ONE HELLENIC CITY IN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THIS WAR
WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT PROVE A VERY POWERFUL NEIGHBOUR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND MADE WAR UPON THE NEW SETTLERS UNTIL THEY AT LAST WORE THEM OUT IN SPITE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS PEOPLE FLOCKING FROM ALL QUARTERS TO A PLACE FOUNDED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
THE BATTLE DID NOT END UNTIL THE EVENING THE NEXT DAY MENEDAIUS WHO ON THE DEATH OF EURYLOCHUS AND MACARIUS HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE SOLE COMMAND BEING AT A LOSS AFTER SO SIGNAL A DEFEAT HOW TO STAY AND SUSTAIN A SIEGE
THE ACARNANIANS AND A FEW OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS MOST OF WHOM WERE KEPT BACK BY FORCE BY THE AMBRACIOTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT ARGOS AND WERE PREPARING TO GIVE BATTLE TO THE ENEMY HAVING CHOSEN DEMOSTHENES TO COMMAND THE WHOLE OF THE ALLIED ARMY IN CONCERT WITH THEIR OWN GENERALS
E UNITING HERE AT DAYBREAK THEY SAT DOWN AT THE PLACE CALLED METROPOLIS AND ENCAMPED
THE ALLIES IN SICILY HAD SAILED TO ATHENS AND INDUCED THE ATHENIANS TO SEND OUT MORE VESSELS TO THEIR ASSISTANCE POINTING OUT THAT THE SYRACUSANS WHO ALREADY COMMANDED THEIR LAND WERE MAKING EFFORTS TO GET TOGETHER A NAVY TO AVOID BEING ANY LONGER EXCLUDED FROM THE SEA BY A FEW VESSELS
THE ACARNANIANS URGED DEMOSTHENES THE ATHENIAN GENERAL TO BUILD A WALL SO AS TO CUT OFF THE TOWN FROM THE CONTINENT A MEASURE WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED WOULD SECURE ITS CAPTURE AND RID THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL OF A MOST TROUBLESOME ENEMY
CELEBRATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE QUINQUENNIAL FESTIVAL OF THE DELIAN GAMES ONCE UPON A TIME INDEED THERE WAS A GREAT ASSEMBLAGE OF THE IONIANS AND THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDERS AT DELOS
SON OF CAPATON UPON THE RIVER CAICINUS TOOK SOME ARMS AND DEPARTED
NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
A GARRISON OF HEAVY INFANTRY WAS ALSO REGULARLY SENT THERE AND GREAT ATTENTION PAID TO THE ISLAND AS IT WAS THE LANDING PLACE FOR THE MERCHANTMEN FROM EGYPT AND LIBYA AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURED LACONIA FROM THE ATTACKS OF PRIVATEERS FROM THE SEA
AND GAVE HOSTAGES AND ALL OTHER SECURITIES REQUIRED THE SAME SUMMER THE ATHENIANS SENT THIRTY SHIPS ROUND PELOPONNESE UNDER DEMOSTHENES
MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE FROM THE AETOLIANS AND RETIRED TO NAUPACTUS AND FROM THENCE WENT IN THEIR SHIPS TO ATHENS DEMOSTHENES STAYING BEHIND IN NAUPACTUS AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEING AFRAID TO FACE THE ATHENIANS AFTER THE DISASTER
THE STREAM OF FIRE ISSUED FROM ETNA AS ON FORMER OCCASIONS AND DESTROYED SOME LAND OF THE CATANIANS WHO LIVE UPON MOUNT ETNA WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOUNTAIN IN SICILY FIFTY YEARS IT IS SAID HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LAST ERUPTION THERE HAVING BEEN THREE IN ALL SINCE THE HELLENES HAVE INHABITED SICILY
IN THE RETREAT THE ALLIES RETREATING AFTER THE ATHENIANS WERE ATTACKED BY THE SYRACUSANS FROM THE FORT AND A LARGE PART OF THEIR ARMY ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AFTER THIS LACHES AND THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS MADE SOME DESCENTS IN LOCRIS AND DEFEATING THE LOCRIANS WHO CAME AGAINST THEM WITH PROXENUS
AND PLENTY OF OTHER SUPPLIES AND MIGHT FROM THIS BASE EASILY RAVAGE LESBOS WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE AEOLIAN TOWNS ON THE CONTINENT
AND WITH THE REST ENCAMPED IN AMPHILOCHIA AT THE PLACE CALLED CRENAE OR THE WELLS TO WATCH FOR EURYLOCHUS AND HIS PELOPONNESIANS AND TO PREVENT THEIR PASSING THROUGH AND EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE AMBRACIOTS
THE DEAD THEY GAVE BACK TO HIM AND SETTING UP A TROPHY TOOK UP THEIR OWN ALSO TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THE RETREAT DEMANDED THEY REFUSED PUBLICLY TO THE ARMY BUT PERMISSION TO DEPART WITHOUT DELAY WAS SECRETLY GRANTED TO THE MANTINEANS AND TO MENEDAIUS
WITH THEIR HELLENIC ALLIES AND SUCH OF THE SICEL SUBJECTS OR ALLIES OF SYRACUSE AS HAD REVOLTED FROM HER AND JOINED THEIR ARMY MARCHED AGAINST THE SICEL TOWN INESSA THE ACROPOLIS OF WHICH WAS HELD BY THE SYRACUSANS AND AFTER ATTACKING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT RETIRED
ALL OF WHOM JOINED IN THE EXPEDITION THE OLPAEANS CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH GIVING HOSTAGES WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING THE INVASION
A CNIDIAN COLONY WHO LIVE IN ONE OF THEM OF NO GREAT SIZE CALLED LIPARA AND FROM THIS AS THEIR HEADQUARTERS CULTIVATE THE REST
WHICH THE ACARNANIANS SET APART FOR DEMOSTHENES AND WHICH HE BROUGHT TO ATHENS IN PERSON HIS RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AFTER THE AETOLIAN DISASTER BEING RENDERED LESS HAZARDOUS BY THIS EXPLOIT THE ATHENIANS IN THE TWENTY SHIPS ALSO WENT OFF TO NAUPACTUS
WERE AGAIN ENGAGED AT CLOSE QUARTERS AT THIS MOMENT A CORINTHIAN COMPANY HAVING COME TO THE RELIEF OF THE LEFT WING ROUTED AND PURSUED THE ATHENIAN RIGHT TO THE SEA
MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE ARMY ON EITHER SIDE FOUGHT ON TENACIOUSLY ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT WING OF THE CORINTHIANS WHERE LYCOPHRON SUSTAINED THE ATTACK OF THE ATHENIAN LEFT WHICH IT WAS FEARED MIGHT ATTEMPT THE VILLAGE OF SOLYGIA AFTER HOLDING ON FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT EITHER GIVING WAY
WHO HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE END OF THE LINE RECEIVED AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY REPULSED THE CORINTHIANS WHO THEREUPON RETREATED TO A WALL UPON THE RISING GROUND BEHIND AND THROWING DOWN THE STONES UPON THEM
SON OF EUTHYCLES WHO REACHED THEIR DESTINATION AFTER A DIFFICULT JOURNEY ACROSS THE CONTINENT SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF THE AFFAIR OF AMBRACIA THE SAME WINTER THE ATHENIANS IN SICILY MADE A DESCENT FROM THEIR SHIPS UPON THE TERRITORY OF HIMERA
AND BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE BEING BETRAYED EVEN THREW A DART OR TWO AT SOME OF THEIR GENERALS WHO TRIED TO STOP THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT LEAVE HAD BEEN GIVEN EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THEY LET PASS THE MANTINEANS AND PELOPONNESIANS AND SLEW ONLY THE AMBRACIOTS THERE BEING MUCH DISPUTE AND DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING WHETHER A MAN WAS AN AMBRACIOT OR A PELOPONNESIAN
AND DESCENDED INTO THE ARGIVE TERRITORY AFTER NIGHTFALL AND PASSING BETWEEN THE CITY OF ARGOS AND THE ACARNANIAN POSTS AT CRENAE
AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE PELOPONNESIANS BY DEMOSTHENES AND HIS ACARNANIAN COLLEAGUES WHO DESIRED TO STRIP THE AMBRACIOTS AND THE MERCENARY HOST OF FOREIGNERS OF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND ABOVE ALL TO DISCREDIT THE LACEDAEMONIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS WITH THE HELLENES IN THOSE PARTS
RATTLED OVER THE SIDE AND THE WHOLE SHIP QUIVERED WITH HER LONG GRAY FLANKS SMOKING IN WREATHS OF STEAM NO CRIED JUKES I DIDN'T WHAT'S THE GOOD I MIGHT JUST AS WELL FLING MY RESIGNATION AT THIS BULKHEAD I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN MAKE A MAN LIKE THAT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
GIVE ME THE DULLEST ASS FOR A SKIPPER BEFORE A ROGUE
SUNBURNT AND SMILING FAINTLY WITH DOWNCAST EYES WHEN HE RAISED THEM THEY WERE PERCEIVED TO BE DIRECT IN THEIR GLANCE AND OF BLUE COLOUR HIS HAIR WAS FAIR AND EXTREMELY FINE CLASPING FROM TEMPLE TO TEMPLE THE BALD DOME OF HIS SKULL IN A CLAMP
SOMETIMES YOU WOULD THINK HE HADN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO SEE ANYTHING WRONG AND YET IT ISN'T THAT
WITH NOTHING EXCEPT A TWO POUND HAMMER AND A WHIP SAW IN THE WAY OF TOOLS YET THE UNINTERESTING LIVES OF MEN SO ENTIRELY GIVEN TO THE ACTUALITY OF THE BARE EXISTENCE HAVE THEIR MYSTERIOUS SIDE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
YES SIR WITH THE THIRD ENGINEER YES SIR HE WALKS OFF TO STARBOARD AND SITS UNDER THE DODGER ON A LITTLE CAMPSTOOL OF HIS AND FOR HALF AN HOUR PERHAPS HE MAKES NO SOUND EXCEPT THAT I HEARD HIM SNEEZE ONCE THEN AFTER A WHILE
SOLOMON SAYS SHE HAD THE TRICK OF FIRING OFF SOLOMON'S UTTERANCES ALSO UPON STRANGERS ASTONISHING THEM EASILY BY THE UNFAMILIAR TEXT AND THE UNEXPECTEDLY JOCULAR VEIN OF THESE QUOTATIONS ON THE DAY THE NEW CURATE CALLED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE COTTAGE
UNDER THE SAME ROOF THERE DWELT ALSO A DAUGHTER CALLED LYDIA AND A SON TOM THESE TWO WERE BUT SLIGHTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FATHER MAINLY THEY KNEW HIM AS A RARE BUT PRIVILEGED VISITOR
SHARED WITH MISTER ROUT'S TOOTHLESS AND VENERABLE MOTHER A LITTLE COTTAGE NEAR TEDDINGTON SHE WOULD RUN OVER HER CORRESPONDENCE AT BREAKFAST WITH LIVELY EYES AND SCREAM OUT INTERESTING PASSAGES IN A JOYOUS VOICE AT THE DEAF OLD LADY PREFACING EACH EXTRACT BY THE WARNING SHOUT
HE SMILED FROM ON HIGH AT JUKES AND WENT ON SMOKING AND GLANCING ABOUT QUIETLY IN THE MANNER OF A KIND UNCLE LENDING AN EAR TO THE TALE OF AN EXCITED SCHOOLBOY THEN GREATLY AMUSED BUT IMPASSIVE HE ASKED
WHICH TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE EXERCISED IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS SON A LITTLE PITYINGLY AS IF UPON A HALF WITTED PERSON
OH AYE THE BLESSED GAMP THANK EE JUKES THANK EE WOULD MUTTER CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HEARTILY WITHOUT LOOKING UP HAVING JUST ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO CARRY HIM THROUGH EACH SUCCESSIVE DAY AND NO MORE HE WAS TRANQUILLY SURE OF HIMSELF
EJACULATED WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM HIS BRUSQUE COME ALONG JOHN MAKE LOOK SEE SET THE CHINAMAN IN MOTION AT HIS HEELS WANCHEE LOOK SEE ALL SAME LOOK SEE CAN DO SAID JUKES
WITH OUTLANDISH NAMES OF LUMBER PORTS OF RICE PORTS OF COTTON PORTS
HERE LET ME TELL YOU THE OLD MAN'S LATEST MISTER SOLOMON ROUT FREQUENTLY ALLUDED TO AS LONG SOL OLD SOL OR FATHER ROUT FROM FINDING HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY THE TALLEST MAN ON BOARD EVERY SHIP HE JOINED
BUT IT IS DULL TOO TO BE WITH A MAN LIKE THIS IN THE LONG RUN OLD SOL SAYS HE HASN'T MUCH CONVERSATION CONVERSATION O LORD HE NEVER TALKS THE OTHER DAY I HAD BEEN YARNING UNDER THE BRIDGE WITH ONE OF THE ENGINEERS AND HE MUST HAVE HEARD US
OLD MISTER SIGG LIKED A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND ONE THAT YOU COULD BE SURE WOULD NOT TRY TO IMPROVE UPON HIS INSTRUCTIONS
WITH FAINT CONTEMPT I ADMIT HE HAS NOTHING OF YOUR FANCY SKIPPER ABOUT HIM IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE ELDER MAN CURTLY IS THE FOREMAN OF THE JOINERS ON THE NAN SHAN OUTSIDE COME IN BATES
HE SIMPLY KNOCKS ME OVER AT THAT MOMENT CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR BACK FROM THE SHORE CROSSED THE DECK UMBRELLA IN HAND ESCORTED BY A MOURNFUL SELF POSSESSED CHINAMAN WALKING BEHIND IN PAPER SOLED SILK SHOES AND WHO ALSO CARRIED AN UMBRELLA
THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS STATE ROOM BELOW AND PRACTICALLY LIVED ALL HIS DAYS ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS SHIP OFTEN HAVING HIS MEALS SENT UP AND SLEEPING AT NIGHT IN THE CHART ROOM AND HE INDITED THERE HIS HOME LETTERS EACH OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION CONTAINED THE PHRASE
WHO OF AN EVENING SMOKED HIS PIPE IN THE DINING ROOM AND SLEPT IN THE HOUSE THE LANKY GIRL UPON THE WHOLE WAS RATHER ASHAMED OF HIM THE BOY WAS FRANKLY AND UTTERLY INDIFFERENT IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD DELIGHTFUL UNAFFECTED WAY MANLY BOYS HAVE
THEY ARE SEAS FULL OF EVERY DAY ELOQUENT FACTS SUCH AS ISLANDS SAND BANKS REEFS SWIFT AND CHANGEABLE CURRENTS TANGLED FACTS THAT NEVERTHELESS SPEAK TO A SEAMAN IN CLEAR AND DEFINITE LANGUAGE
AND FROM HIS INEXPERIENCE OF JOLLY WOMEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT SHE MUST BE DEPLORABLY INSANE THEY WERE EXCELLENT FRIENDS AFTERWARDS
AS OF FLUFFY SILK THE HAIR OF HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY CARROTY AND FLAMING RESEMBLED A GROWTH OF COPPER WIRE CLIPPED SHORT TO THE LINE OF THE LIP WHILE NO MATTER HOW CLOSE HE SHAVED
HE STRUGGLED WITH HIS FEELINGS FOR A WHILE AND THEN REMARKED QUEER FLAG FOR A MAN TO SAIL UNDER SIR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE FLAG INQUIRED CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR SEEMS ALL RIGHT TO ME AND HE WALKED ACROSS TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK
I SEE PEOPLE ASHORE AT IT ALL DAY LONG AND THEN IN THE EVENING THEY SIT DOWN AND KEEP AT IT OVER THE DRINKS MUST BE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE WAS SO PATIENT ABOUT IT
NO I LOOKED UP THE BOOK LENGTH TWICE THE BREADTH AND THE ELEPHANT EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE
WHICH HE HUNG ON THE END OF A STEAM WINDLESS EMBODYING ALL THE LATEST IMPROVEMENTS MY UNCLE WROTE OF YOU FAVOURABLY BY YESTERDAY'S MAIL TO OUR GOOD FRIENDS MESSRS SIGG YOU KNOW
HE EXTOLLED THE SKY THE SEAS THE SHIPS AND THE EASY LIFE OF THE FAR EAST THE NAN SHAN HE AFFIRMED WAS SECOND TO NONE AS A SEA BOAT WE HAVE NO BRASS BOUND UNIFORMS BUT THEN WE ARE LIKE BROTHERS HERE HE WROTE
STUTTERED THE YOUNG MAN VERY RED IN THE FACE I MUST SAY I DON'T HE'S MY HUSBAND SHE ANNOUNCED IN A GREAT SHOUT THROWING HERSELF BACK IN THE CHAIR PERCEIVING THE JOKE SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY WITH A HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES
SHE WAS CALLED LUCY IT DID NOT SUGGEST ITSELF TO HIM TO MENTION WHETHER HE THOUGHT THE NAME PRETTY AND THEN THEY DIED
HE RAN HIS FINGER OVER THEM AND WHEN HE CAME TO SIAM HE CONTEMPLATED WITH GREAT ATTENTION THE RED FIELD AND THE WHITE ELEPHANT NOTHING COULD BE MORE SIMPLE BUT TO MAKE SURE HE BROUGHT THE BOOK OUT ON THE BRIDGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING THE COLOURED DRAWING WITH THE REAL THING AT THE FLAGSTAFF ASTERN
CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR OF THE STEAMER NAN SHAN HAD A PHYSIOGNOMY THAT IN THE ORDER OF MATERIAL APPEARANCES WAS THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF HIS MIND IT PRESENTED NO MARKED CHARACTERISTICS OF FIRMNESS OR STUPIDITY
A CROSS SWELL HAD SET IN FROM THE DIRECTION OF FORMOSA CHANNEL ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WITHOUT DISTURBING THESE PASSENGERS MUCH BECAUSE THE NAN SHAN WITH HER FLAT BOTTOM ROLLING CHOCKS ON BILGES AND GREAT BREADTH OF BEAM
WHO HAVING NO TALENT FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGES MANGLED THE VERY PIDGIN ENGLISH CRUELLY HE POINTED AT THE OPEN HATCH CATCHEE NUMBER ONE PIECIE PLACE TO SLEEP IN EH HE WAS GRUFF AS BECAME HIS RACIAL SUPERIORITY BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY
HE'S TOO DENSE TO TROUBLE ABOUT AND THAT'S THE TRUTH
WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN MADE TO SEE ALL IT MAY CONTAIN OF PERFIDY OF VIOLENCE AND OF TERROR THERE ARE ON SEA AND LAND SUCH MEN THUS FORTUNATE
BUT IT ISN'T HE'S SO JOLLY INNOCENT THAT IF YOU WERE TO PUT YOUR THUMB TO YOUR NOSE AND WAVE YOUR FINGERS AT HIM
HE WENT ON WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT ELEPHANT THERE I TAKE IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF THE UNION JACK IN THE FLAG
D'YE HEAR JUKES THIS CHINAMAN HERE WAS COMING WITH THE SHIP AS FAR AS FU CHAU A SORT OF INTERPRETER HE WOULD BE
HE DISAPPEARED DUCKING LOW UNDER A SLING OF TEN DIRTY GUNNY BAGS FULL OF SOME COSTLY MERCHANDISE AND EXHALING A REPULSIVE SMELL CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR MEANTIME HAD GONE ON THE BRIDGE AND INTO THE CHART ROOM
WE HAD BETTER BE GOING TOGETHER OVER THE SHIP CAPTAIN SAID THE SENIOR PARTNER AND THE THREE MEN STARTED TO VIEW THE PERFECTIONS OF THE NAN SHAN FROM STEM TO STERN AND FROM HER KEELSON TO THE TRUCKS OF HER TWO STUMPY POLE MASTS CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HAD BEGUN BY TAKING OFF HIS COAT
AND THE HEAT WAS CLOSE THE COOLIES LOUNGED TALKED SMOKED OR STARED OVER THE RAIL SOME DRAWING WATER OVER THE SIDE SLUICED EACH OTHER A FEW SLEPT ON HATCHES WHILE SEVERAL SMALL PARTIES OF SIX SAT ON THEIR HEELS
WELL IT LOOKS QUEER TO ME BURST OUT JUKES GREATLY EXASPERATED AND FLUNG OFF THE BRIDGE CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WAS AMAZED AT THESE MANNERS AFTER A WHILE HE STEPPED QUIETLY INTO THE CHART ROOM AND OPENED HIS INTERNATIONAL SIGNAL CODE BOOK
IT HAD NO PRONOUNCED CHARACTERISTICS WHATEVER IT WAS SIMPLY ORDINARY IRRESPONSIVE AND UNRUFFLED THE ONLY THING HIS ASPECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID TO SUGGEST AT TIMES WAS BASHFULNESS BECAUSE HE WOULD SIT IN BUSINESS OFFICES ASHORE
HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF A STOOPING LEISURELY CONDESCENSION
AND A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE NAN SHAN STEAMED OUT TO THE EAST WITHOUT MAC WHIRR HAVING OFFERED ANY FURTHER REMARK AS TO HER FITTINGS
ON CHRISTMAS DAY AT FOUR P M WE FELL IN WITH SOME ICEBERGS THE OLD PEOPLE ULTIMATELY BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH A GOOD MANY NAMES OF SHIPS AND WITH THE NAMES OF THE SKIPPERS WHO COMMANDED THEM WITH THE NAMES OF SCOTS AND ENGLISH SHIPOWNERS WITH THE NAMES OF SEAS OCEANS STRAITS PROMONTORIES
BECAUSE THE CHIEF ENGINEER HAD ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO KEEP HIS DESK LOCKED HIS WIFE RELISHED HIS STYLE GREATLY THEY WERE A CHILDLESS COUPLE AND MISSUS ROUT A BIG HIGH BOSOMED JOLLY WOMAN OF FORTY
SURROUNDING IRON TRAYS WITH PLATES OF RICE AND TINY TEACUPS AND EVERY SINGLE CELESTIAL OF THEM WAS CARRYING WITH HIM ALL HE HAD IN THE WORLD A WOODEN CHEST WITH A RINGING LOCK AND BRASS ON THE CORNERS CONTAINING THE SAVINGS OF HIS LABOURS
BUT HE HAD NEVER BEEN GIVEN A GLIMPSE OF IMMEASURABLE STRENGTH AND OF IMMODERATE WRATH THE WRATH THAT PASSES EXHAUSTED BUT NEVER APPEASED THE WRATH AND FURY OF THE PASSIONATE SEA HE KNEW IT EXISTED
HIS FATHER NEVER REALLY FORGAVE HIM FOR THIS UNDUTIFUL STUPIDITY WE COULD HAVE GOT ON WITHOUT HIM HE USED TO SAY LATER ON BUT THERE'S THE BUSINESS AND HE AN ONLY SON TOO HIS MOTHER WEPT VERY MUCH AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE
AND CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WROTE HOME FROM THE COAST OF CHINA TWELVE TIMES EVERY YEAR DESIRING QUAINTLY TO BE REMEMBERED TO THE CHILDREN AND SUBSCRIBING HIMSELF YOUR LOVING HUSBAND
TO EXPRESS HIS FAVOURABLE OPINION SO LOUD OR IN TERMS SO FANCIFUL SHE WAS A GOOD SHIP UNDOUBTEDLY AND NOT OLD EITHER SHE HAD BEEN BUILT IN DUMBARTON LESS THAN THREE YEARS BEFORE TO THE ORDER OF A FIRM OF MERCHANTS IN SIAM
THAT'S HIS REGULAR PERFORMANCE BY AND BY HE SAYS
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN FIND TO TALK ABOUT SAYS HE
AND IN THE COURSE OF YEARS HE DESPATCHED OTHER LETTERS TO HIS PARENTS INFORMING THEM OF HIS SUCCESSIVE PROMOTIONS AND OF HIS MOVEMENTS UPON THE VAST EARTH IN THESE MISSIVES COULD BE FOUND SENTENCES LIKE THIS THE HEAT HERE IS VERY GREAT OR
AS CALMLY AS IF THE WORDS SO LONG USED BY SO MANY MEN WERE APART FROM THEIR SHAPE WORN OUT THINGS AND OF A FADED MEANING THE CHINA SEAS NORTH AND SOUTH ARE NARROW SEAS
UNDER A COLLECTED DEMEANOUR TINGED BY A GENTLE AND REFINED MELANCHOLY GLANCED OUT OF HIS ALMOND EYES FROM JUKES TO THE HATCH AND BACK AGAIN VELLY GOOD HE MURMURED IN A DISCONSOLATE UNDERTONE AND HASTENED SMOOTHLY ALONG THE DECKS DODGING OBSTACLES IN HIS COURSE
THERE WERE MATTERS OF DUTY OF COURSE
AND THERE WAS A QUEER WHITE MISTY PATCH IN THE SKY LIKE A HALO OF THE SUN THE FORE DECK PACKED WITH CHINAMEN WAS FULL OF SOMBRE CLOTHING YELLOW FACES AND PIGTAILS
AND HE NEVER LEFT HIS SHIP FOR THE SHORE WITHOUT CLUTCHING IN HIS POWERFUL HAIRY FIST AN ELEGANT UMBRELLA OF THE VERY BEST QUALITY BUT GENERALLY UNROLLED YOUNG JUKES THE CHIEF MATE ATTENDING HIS COMMANDER TO THE GANGWAY
JUKES FLUNG THE NEW LEAD LINE OVER ON THE FORE DECK WITH A LOUD
SHE FOUND OCCASION TO REMARK AS SOLOMON SAYS THE ENGINEERS THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS BEHOLD THE WONDERS OF SAILOR NATURE WHEN A CHANGE IN THE VISITOR'S COUNTENANCE MADE HER STOP AND STARE SOLOMON OH MISSUS ROUT
YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
OTHERS ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES ALSO HE REMARKED AS THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE PEBBLY BEACH A FAINT CRESCENT MOON SHONE OVER THE WATER RUTH WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE BOAT AGROUND ON THE SHORE IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKLE SHELL HE SAID
WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
JUST AS THAT TEACHER HAD OBSERVED HER AS MOST OF THE GIRLS PRESENT HAD HEARD ANNE RECITE
HER HEAD WAS LEANING AGAINST THE FLAG STAFF
RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR SOCIETY WILL LAST LONG AT ANY RATE THOSE GIRLS ARE SURE TO QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AND THAT WILL END THE WHOLE THING OR THEY MAY GO TOO FAR AND HAVE MISS THOMPSON TO RECKON WITH AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY COOL THEIR ARDOR O GIRLS EXCLAIMED GRACE
I AM SURE ROSALIND WILL BE SAFE WITH YOU
SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
FATHER SAYS HE HAS AT LAST SCARED UP TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER AND PLAY A RUBBER OF WHIST MISTER LEVICE FELT HIMSELF A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE AND MISTER TYRRELL HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF OPPONENTS AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP THE SEARCH
YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
ANNE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING RATHER DAZED THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS TO HAVE NOT ONLY A PART BUT THE BEST PART AT THAT THE GIRLS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT HER CONGRATULATING HER ON HER SUCCESS
BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
SLEEP WITH THIS NEW CROWN UPON HER HUMBLE AS THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR MAID MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THE KING RAISED HER SHE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD BEEN THUS CHOSEN BY ONE WHOM SHE HAD DEEMED SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HER
HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SENSE OF POWER THAT ONE HAS OVER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS THAT MAKES ACTING SO FASCINATING IT IS THE OTHER SIDE THAT I HATE SHE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER I SUPPOSE THEATRICAL PEOPLE DO UNDERGO MANY HARDSHIPS SAID GRACE
I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
THEN HE AGAIN HELD CONVERSATION WITH MISS TEBBS WHO NODDED AND LOOKED SMILINGLY TOWARD NORA WHO STOOD SCOWLING FAINTLY RATHER ILL PLEASED AT ATTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
READ THIS HE SAID BRIEFLY HOLDING OUT THE BOOK TO NORA NORA BEGAN AND READ GLIBLY ON UNCONSCIOUSLY EMPHASIZING AS SHE DID SO DOWN ONE PAGE SHE READ AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEXT BEFORE MISTER SOUTHARD SEEMED SATISFIED
SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
BY THE WAY GIRLS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OF ANY USE TO INVITE ELEANOR ELEANOR EXCLAIMED NORA AFTER WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR INVITATION INTO THE FIRE FOR IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL DO SO WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT
WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
AND STOOD INSIDE OF IT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE HOME TILL MONDAY HE SAID TAKING MISSUS LEVICE'S HAND AND RAISING HIS HAT AND I AM OFF ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN GOOD BY AS SHE TURNED IN AT THE GATE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO RUTH
EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
THERE IS NOTHING ABROAD HERE BUT THE STARS SHE ANSWERED FLITTING BEFORE THEM AND THEY ARE STANCH SILENT FRIENDS ON SUCH A NIGHT REMARKED KEMP SOFTLY
AND HOW TO AVOID THEM THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF HER BECOMING GREAT TOO OF COURSE REAL STARS DO APPEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ARE TOO TALENTED TO BE KEPT DOWN HOWEVER THE REALLY GREAT ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
WHAT I HAD INTENDED AND HOW I HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED HE LISTENED SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND SAYING SOMEONE OUGHT TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH THE OLD WOMAN TURNED IN TO PUT ON THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES
I HOPE IT WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU MY BOY AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ROUSING EVERY BAD AND ANGRY PASSION IN HER I FEAR IT WILL BE OF NO USE TO TRY TO MAKE HER BE SORRY AND REPENT IT IS TO HER
SHE'S ONLY TOLD YOU HER SIDE OF IT YOU HAVE CONFESSED TO THE TRUTH OF WHAT SHE ALLEGES SAID MY FATHER I DID THINK HE WENT ON MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER THOUGH A GOOD DEAL IN BOTH
I VENTURED TO LOOK UP AT THE KELPIE ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD GROWN WHITE AND GREW WHITER WHEN TURKEY LEFT THE ROOM SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TOO BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE MUST STAY AND HEAR ME TO THE END
HOW SHOULD I TELL RETURNED ANDREW THE OLD WOMAN HAS A VERY QUEER COCK I KNOW THAT ALWAYS ROOSTS ON THE TOP OF HER BED AND CROWS LIKE NO COCK I EVER HEARD CROW OR IT MIGHT BE WANDERING WILLIE
I CANNOT SAY THAT I EVER HEARD HIM GIVE UTTERANCE TO ANYTHING OF THE SORT BUT WHENCE ELSE SHOULD I HAVE HAD SUCH A FIRM CONVICTION DATING FROM A PERIOD FARTHER BACK THAN MY MEMORY CAN REACH THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BECOME OF THE OTHER HORSES
HER PLACE IN THE HOUSE WAS TO OUR ENDLESS HAPPINESS TAKEN BY KIRSTY AND FAITHFULLY SHE CARRIED OUT MY FATHER'S INSTRUCTIONS THAT ALONG WITH THE SACRED HANDFUL OF MEAL A PENNY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EVERY ONE OF THE PARISH POOR
BEFORE I HAD ENDED TURKEY MADE HIS APPEARANCE USHERED IN BY ALLISTER BOTH WERE OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING MY FATHER STOPPED ME AND ORDERED TURKEY AWAY UNTIL I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
AND I HEARD THE LONELY SIGH OF A LITTLE BREEZE WANDER THROUGH ITS BRANCHES THE NEXT INSTANT A FRIGHTFUL SOUND FROM WITHIN THE COTTAGE BROKE THE NIGHT AIR INTO WHAT SEEMED A UNIVERSAL SHRIEK MISSY GAVE A PLUNGE
NOT TO ME YOU HAVE DONE THE WRONG I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF FOR MYSELF QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT IT IS A VERY DREADFUL THING TO THROW DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF REPENTANCE AND TURNING FROM EVIL WORKS
NOW THERE IS NOTHING PARTICULARLY FRIGHTFUL ABOUT A PAIR OF BELLOWS HOWEVER LARGE IT MAY BE AND YET THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT HUGE STRUCTURE OF LEATHER AND WOOD WITH THE GREAT IRON NOSE PROJECTING FROM THE CONTRACTING CHEEKS OF IT
SHE FLEW HOME IT DID NOT TAKE HER A MINUTE TO REACH THE STABLE DOOR THERE SHE HAD TO STOP FOR I HAD SHUT IT WHEN I BROUGHT HER OUT IT WAS MORTIFYING TO FIND MYSELF THERE INSTEAD OF UNDER JOHN ADAM'S HAYLOFT
THEN I MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING MISSUS MITCHELL TO REPENTANCE I COULD HAVE REASONED WITH HER ON THE MATTER AND SHOWN HER THAT SHE WAS NOT MERELY A THIEF BUT A THIEF OF THE WORST KIND A JUDAS WHO ROBBED THE POOR
HOW SHE MANAGED TO GET HER CHEST AWAY I CANNOT TELL I THINK SHE MUST HAVE HID IT IN SOME OUTHOUSE AND FETCHED IT THE NEXT NIGHT MANY LITTLE THINGS WERE MISSED FROM THE HOUSE AFTERWARDS BUT NOTHING OF GREAT VALUE
AFTER ALL MY GRAND IDEAS OF RESCUE AND RESTORATION WAS TOO MORTIFYING I SHOULD FEEL SO SMALL WHEN I WOKE IN THE MORNING
I DON'T SAY IT WAS RIGHT FATHER AND I'M VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED YOU YOU HAVE OFFENDED ME AND VERY DEEPLY YOU HAVE BEEN UNKIND AND INDEED CRUEL TO A GOOD WOMAN WHO HAS DONE HER BEST FOR YOU FOR MANY YEARS
AT THE HEAD OF THE OLD WOMAN'S BED SO CAPABLE YET SO USELESS DID RETURN UPON ME WITH TERROR IN THE DUSK OF THAT LONELY NIGHT IT WAS MINGLED WITH A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE OLD WOMAN WAS A BIT OF A WITCH
AS IT APPEARED TO ME NOW SHE WAS STILL ALIVE HOWEVER VERY OLD AND BEDRIDDEN I RECOLLECTED THAT FROM THE TOP OF HER WOODEN BED HUNG A ROPE FOR HER TO PULL HERSELF UP BY WHEN SHE WANTED TO TURN FOR SHE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC
MY COURAGE HAD BEEN REVIVING FAST IN THE WARM PRESENCE OF A HUMAN BEING I WAS STILL SEATED ON MISSY TO GO HOME HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR JAMIE AND THEREFORE NOTHING FOR ELSIE
AND A VERY DOUBTFUL MEMORY THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN ON ONE OCCASION BY SOME NIGHT FARER WHEN A FRIGHTFUL STORM WAS RAGING BLOWING AWAY AT THAT VERY BELLOWS AS HARD AS HER SKINNY ARMS AND LEAN BODY COULD WORK THE LEVER
YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME TO BED RANALD HE SAID WON'T YOU BE FRIGHTENED ANDREW I ASKED FRIGHTENED WHAT SHOULD I BE FRIGHTENED AT IT'S ALL WASTE TO BE FRIGHTENED BEFORE YOU KNOW WHETHER THE THING IS WORTH IT
AND RODE ON MORE GENTLY IN BETTER HARMONY WITH THE NIGHT NOT A SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE EXCEPT THE ROUGH CRY OF THE LAND RAIL FROM THE FIELDS AND THE CLATTER OF MISSY'S FEET I DID NOT LIKE THE NOISE SHE MADE AND GOT UPON THE GRASS
YOU MAY BE RIGHT TURKEY I DARE SAY YOU ARE RIGHT I HOPE YOU ARE FOR THOUGH BAD ENOUGH THAT WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO BAD AS DOING IT FOR HERSELF I AM VERY SORRY FATHER I SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON
THAT THE HORSES MIGHT NOT BE STARTLED IF I CAME UPON ONE OF THEM UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE STABLE WAS NARROW AND THEY SOMETIMES LAY A GOOD BIT OUT OF THEIR STALLS I TOOK CARE HOWEVER TO SPEAK IN A LOW TONE
BUT NOTHING CAN JUSTIFY SUCH CONDUCT I BEGAN WITH TREMBLING VOICE I HAD GONE OVER IN MY MIND THE NIGHT BEFORE ALL I WOULD SAY KNOWING IT BETTER TO TELL THE TALE FROM THE BEGINNING CIRCUMSTANTIALLY
THE RESCUER OF JAMIE DUFF BUT I DID NOT THINK OF THAT FOR A WHILE SHAKEN WITH TERROR AND AFRAID TO DISMOUNT AND BE NEXT THE GROUND I CALLED UPON ANDREW AS WELL AS MY FEAR WOULD PERMIT BUT MY VOICE WAS NEARLY UNMANAGEABLE
IF YOU GO I SHALL KNOW IT IS YOU AND HAVE YOU TAKEN UP AND TRIED FOR STEALING MEANTIME I SHALL GO THE ROUND OF THE PARISH I DO NOT THINK ALL THE POOR PEOPLE WILL HAVE COMBINED TO LIE AGAINST YOU THEY ALL HATE ME SAID THE KELPIE
I SUPPOSE SHE WAS AWARE THAT I GREW STRONGER AND MORE DETERMINED I SOON MANAGED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE STABLE FOR I KNEW WHERE THE KEY LAY IT WAS VERY DARK BUT I FELT MY WAY THROUGH TALKING ALL THE TIME
TILL ANDREW CAME OUT AGAIN AND AS I SAT STILL ON THE MARE'S BACK MY COURAGE GRADUALLY ROSE NOTHING INCREASES TERROR SO MUCH AS RUNNING AWAY WHEN HE REAPPEARED I ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE ANDREW
I COULD ONLY REMEMBER THAT I HAD HEARD A FRIGHTFUL NOISE BUT AS TO WHAT IT WAS LIKE I COULD SCARCELY BEAR THE SMALLEST TESTIMONY I BEGGED ANDREW TO PUT THE SADDLE ON FOR ME AS I SHOULD THEN HAVE MORE COMMAND OF MISSY
SHE STOOD UP AND WITH HER FISTS IN HER SIDES ADDRESSED MY FATHER I'M VERY SORRY SIR TO HAVE TO MAKE COMPLAINTS IT'S A THING I DON'T LIKE AND I'M NOT GIVEN TO I'M SURE I TRY TO DO MY DUTY BY MASTER RANALD
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ABJECT CONDITION NOW MISSUS MITCHELL HE SAID SHE HAD NOTHING TO REPLY BEYOND ASSERTING THAT TURKEY AND I HAD ALWAYS HATED AND PERSECUTED HER AND HAD NOW TOLD A PACK OF LIES WHICH WE HAD AGREED UPON
MISSY WAS SURE TO GO TO HEAVEN I HAD A KIND OF NOTION THAT BEING THE BEARER OF MY FATHER UPON ALL HIS MISSIONS OF DOCTRINE AND MERCY SHE BELONGED TO THE CLERGY AND SHARING IN THEIR PRIVILEGES MUST HAVE A CHANCE BEFORE OTHER ANIMALS OF HER KIND
AND NEITHER SHE NOR WANDERING WILLIE EVER APPEARED AGAIN WE WERE ALL SATISFIED THAT POOR OLD BETTY KNEW NOTHING OF HER CONDUCT IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO DECEIVE HER FOR SHE WAS ALONE IN HER COTTAGE ONLY WAITED UPON BY A NEIGHBOUR
AND MADE HIM TELL THE STORY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT ALTHOUGH HE QUESTIONED US CLOSELY HE FOUND NO DISCREPANCY BETWEEN OUR ACCOUNTS HE TURNED AT LAST TO MISSUS MITCHELL WHO BUT FOR HER RAGE
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE KNIGHT ERRANTRY I MUST MENTION THAT MY FATHER NEVER OBJECTED NOW TO MY RIDING HIS LITTLE MARE MISSY AS WE CALLED HER INDEED I HAD GREAT LIBERTY WITH REGARD TO HER
AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS HOUSE I FELT A LITTLE CONFUSED FOR I NOW SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY FATHER COULD NOT APPROVE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS I WHISPERED TO ALLISTER RUN AND FETCH TURKEY TELL HIM TO COME DIRECTLY
WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE UP FOR IT I SOBBED I DON'T SEE AT THIS MOMENT WHAT YOU CAN DO I WILL TURN IT OVER IN MY MIND YOU MAY GO NOW THEREUPON TURKEY AND I WALKED AWAY
AT THE STABLE DOOR AND RODE AWAY SHE HAD SCARCELY BEEN OUT ALL DAY AND WAS RATHER IN THE MOOD FOR A RIDE THE VOICE OF ANDREW WHOM THE NOISE OF HER FEET HAD AROUSED CAME AFTER ME CALLING TO KNOW WHO IT WAS
AND I THOUGHT WE MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY SOMEHOW BUT RANALD BEGAN HIS TRICKS WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW AND THEN I SAW THAT MINE COULD BE OF NO USE FOR SHE WOULD SUSPECT THEM AFTER HIS MINE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT
BOTH REFLECTIONS MADE IT HORRIBLE BESIDES IF MISSY SHOULD GET INTO THE BOG BUT SHE KNEW BETTER THAN THAT WILD AS HER MOOD WAS SHE AVOIDED IT AND GALLOPED PAST BUT BORE ME TO A FAR MORE FRIGHTFUL GOAL
I CONFESS MADE ME FRIGHTENED I PULLED HARD AT THE REINS BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IN A MINUTE I HAD LOST MY RECKONING AND COULD NOT TELL WHERE I WAS IN THE FIELD WHICH WAS A PRETTY LARGE ONE BUT SOON FINDING THAT WE WERE GALLOPING DOWN A HILL
THAT THE MAN WHO SLEPT WITH ONLY A WOODEN PARTITION BETWEEN HIM AND THE STABLE MIGHT NOT HEAR I SOON HAD THE BRIDLE UPON MISSY BUT WOULD NOT LOSE TIME IN PUTTING ON THE SADDLE I LED HER OUT GOT ON HER BACK WITH THE HELP OF A STONE
BUT YOU MUST BEG MISSUS MITCHELL'S PARDON FIRST AND AFTER THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY I FEAR BUT FATHER YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MY STORY YET WELL GO ON IT IS FAIR I SUPPOSE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES
THAT WANDERING WILLIE IS SOME RELATION OF HERS HE IS THE ONLY POOR PERSON ALMOST THE ONLY PERSON EXCEPT DAVIE I EVER SAW HER BEHAVE KINDLY TO HE WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND ALSO I FANCY THAT OTHER TIME
THUS ARMED AND MOUNTED WITH MY FEET IN THE STIRRUPS AND THEREFORE A GOOD PULL ON MISSY'S MOUTH
EVERYTHING MY FATHER HEARD CONFIRMED THE TALE WE HAD TOLD HIM BUT THE KELPIE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE RESOLVED UPON WITH REGARD TO HER BEFORE HE RETURNED SHE HAD DISAPPEARED
SAID MY FATHER VERY STERNLY ARE THESE THINGS TRUE YES FATHER I ANSWERED
I CALLED OUT IN REPLY FOR I FEARED HE MIGHT ROUSE THE PLACE AND HE WENT BACK COMPOSED IF NOT CONTENTED IT WAS NO USE AT ALL EVENTS TO FOLLOW ME I HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE EXTREME STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT BEGAN TO SINK INTO MY SOUL
FOR SHE AND I WERE ON THE BEST OF TERMS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TAKE A FIT OF OBSTINACY AND REFUSE TO GO IN ANY OTHER THAN THE DIRECTION SHE PLEASED OF LATE HOWEVER SHE HAD ASSERTED HERSELF LESS FREQUENTLY IN THIS MANNER
HE GOES TO SEE HER SOMETIMES AND THE DEMENTED CREATURE MIGHT STRIKE UP HIS PIPES AT ANY UNEARTHLY HOUR I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER SUGGESTION BUT THE SOUND I HAD HEARD HAD ALREADY GROWN SO INDISTINCT IN MY MEMORY
CLOSE BY THE MOUND WITH THE TREES UPON IT THE SCENE OF MY ADVENTURE WITH WANDERING WILLIE AND OF THE FANCIED MURDER I HAD SCARCELY THOUGHT OF EITHER UNTIL THE SHADOWS HAD BEGUN TO FALL LONG AND NOW IN THE NIGHT WHEN ALL WAS SHADOW
SEVERAL TIMES SHE BROKE OUT ACCUSING ME OF TELLING A PACK OF WICKED LIES BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFENDING HERSELF AND SHE MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME WHEN I HAD DONE HE CALLED TURKEY
FRIDAY IS A VERY UNLUCKY DAY HOUSEKEEPERS WILL PREFER PAYING A QUARTER'S RENT EXTRA TO GOING INTO A HOUSE ON THAT DAY IT IS OF COURSE MOST UNLUCKY TO BE MARRIED ON IT
OF COURSE SOLOMON WORE GLASSES UPON HIS EYES ALL WISE PEOPLE WEAR THEM AND HIS FACE WAS EVER GRAVE AND SOLEMN WHILE HE WALKED SLOWLY AND STIFFLY SO THAT PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW HE WAS THE CELEBRATED WISE MAN
AND GIVEN IT CAREFUL THOUGHT AND YET I CANNOT TELL WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK SIR REPLIED THE WISE CHILD IT IS BECAUSE THE COW IS THIRSTY
UNLESS YOU BRING OUT WHAT IS IN YOU GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO GROW AND SEIZE UPON EVERYTHING THAT WILL ENLARGE THE SCOPE OF YOUR HORIZON KEEP YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN
AS TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE ET CETERA
THERE WILL BE BAD LUCK IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YEAR
ANSWERED HIS FATHER WELL CONTINUED SOLOMON THE DOG HAS TWO OTHER LEGS BESIDES AND TWO AND FOUR ARE SIX THEREFORE THE DOG HAS SIX LEGS
IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH THE VILLAGE DOCTOR SOLOMON CAME TO HIM ONE DAY AND ASKED TELL ME SIR WHY HAS A MAN TWO EYES
HIS FATHER THOUGHT HE HAD A WOND'ROUS WISE LOOK WHEN HE WAS BORN AND SO HE NAMED HIM SOLOMON THINKING THAT IF INDEED HE TURNED OUT TO BE WISE THE NAME WOULD FIT HIM NICELY WHEREAS SHOULD HE BE MISTAKEN AND THE BOY GROW UP STUPID
WIELD QUITE AN INFLUENCE IN THEIR LOCALITIES AND EVEN OUTSIDE
PERFECT STREAM AND EVERY DAY HE GAVE NEW EVIDENCE TO HIS FRIENDS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HOLD ALL THE WISE THOUGHTS THAT CAME TO HIM FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER
IF YOU ARE A WOMAN THROW ASIDE THE PEN SIT DOWN AND DARN YOUR BROTHER'S YOUR FATHER'S OR YOUR HUSBAND'S SOCKS OR PUT ON A CALICO APRON TAKE SOAP AND WATER
IF YOU ARE WRITING FOR A WEEKLY PAPER REMEMBER IT DIFFERS FROM A DAILY ONE WEEKLIES WANT WHAT WILL NOT ALONE INTEREST THE MAN ON THE STREET BUT THE WOMAN AT THE FIRESIDE
WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK WELL REALLY REPLIED THE ABASHED SCHOOLMASTER I HAVE NEVER GIVEN THE SUBJECT SERIOUS THOUGHT BUT
ONE A DOG IS CHASING KITTENS ONE A CAT IS WEARING MITTENS ONE A RAT IS EATING CHEESE ONE A WOLF IS FULL OF FLEAS
YOU WILL LOSE BY IT ON THE COMING WEEK
IF A FIRE OCCURRED IN LONDON LAST NIGHT HE CAN READ ABOUT IT AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE IN NEW YORK THIS MORNING AND PROBABLY GET A BETTER ACCOUNT THAN THE LONDONERS THEMSELVES IF A DUEL TAKES PLACE IN PARIS HE CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT
IT WILL BE A VERY SHORT OR A VERY LONG JOB
DO YOU KNOW YES SIR ANSWERED THE BOY THEN SAID THE DOCTOR AFTER TAKING A DOSE OF QUININE TO BRACE UP HIS NERVES FOR HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER
BE SURE THAT NEWSPAPER WRITING OR LITERARY WORK IS NOT YOUR FORTE AND TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE IF NOTHING BETTER PRESENTS ITSELF
EMPEROR OR KING IN THE SAME WAY WOMANHOOD IS THE GRANDEST CROWN THE FEMININE HEAD CAN WEAR WHEN THE WORLD FROWNS ON YOU AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO WRONG POSSESS YOUR SOUL IN PATIENCE AND HOPE FOR THE DAWN OF A BRIGHTER DAY
AND WHEN HE JUMPED INTO IT HIS SPECTACLES FELL OFF AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FOUND THAT HE COULD SEE AGAIN
ON ITS SECULAR SIDE IT DEALS WITH HUMAN EVENTS IN SUCH AN IMPARTIAL WAY THAT EVERY ONE NO MATTER TO WHAT CLASS THEY MAY BELONG OR TO WHAT CREED THEY MAY SUBSCRIBE CAN TAKE A LIVING PERSONAL INTEREST
HOW AM I TO GET OUT OF HERE HE ASKED AT LAST YOU MUST JUMP OUT REPLIED THE DOCTOR SINCE YOU HAVE JUMPED IN SO SOLOMON MADE A GREAT JUMP
REMEMBER HONEST LABOR
AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE THEORETICAL THE ORDINARY MONTHLY MAGAZINE TREATS OF THE LEADING QUESTIONS AND ISSUES WHICH ARE ENGAGING THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD FOR THE MOMENT GREAT INVENTIONS GREAT DISCOVERIES
WHILE THE BOY NOT KNOWING SUCH WORDS WOULD PROBABLY SIMPLY TELL WHAT HE SAW HOW GREAT THE DAMAGE WAS WHO WERE KILLED OR INJURED ET CETERA AND USE LANGUAGE WHICH ALL WOULD UNDERSTAND OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME BRILLIANT SCHOLARS
JUST AS YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE FACE TO FACE WITH HIM WHAT CAN YOU WRITE ABOUT WHY ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WILL CONSTITUTE CURRENT NEWS SOME LEADING EVENT OF THE DAY
IF YOU ARE OF THE MASCULINE GENDER
PERSEVERANCE COUNTS MORE IN THE
AND EVEN WHEN A CHILD HE WAS SO REMARKABLE FOR HIS WISDOM THAT PEOPLE SHOOK THEIR HEADS GRAVELY AND SAID WHEN HE GROWS UP THERE WILL BE NO NEED OF BOOKS FOR HE WILL KNOW EVERYTHING
MY EYES ARE SCRATCHED OUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY ARE ASKED THE VILLAGE DOCTOR I CAN SEE THEY ARE SCRATCHED OUT REPLIED SOLOMON
MANY OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WRITERS OF OUR TIME
AND AFTER THAT NO ONE EVER QUESTIONED THE WOND'ROUS WISDOM OF OUR WISE MAN AND WHEN HE FINALLY DIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE THEY BUILT A GREAT MONUMENT OVER HIS GRAVE
GO OVER EVERYTHING YOU WRITE CUT AND SLASH AND PRUNE UNTIL YOU GET IT INTO AS PERFECT FORM AS POSSIBLE ELIMINATE EVERY SUPERFLUOUS WORD AND BE CAREFUL TO STRIKE OUT ALL AMBIGUOUS EXPRESSIONS AND REFERENCES
AS IT WILL BRING ILL LUCK
IT IS COMMON TO BLOW ON THE DEAL WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT FOR GOOD LUCK
BOTH BY WAY OF CIRCULATION AND ADVERTISEMENTS IT IS SURPRISING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO MAKE A LIVING IN THE NEWSPAPER FIELD
AND ON ONE SIDE OF IT WERE THE WORDS SOLOMON THE MAN WHO WAS WOND'ROUS WISE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU MUST BECOME RESILIENT IF YOU ARE PRESSED DOWN SPRING UP AGAIN
IN OTHER WORDS THEY UNDERSTOOD HUMAN NATURE AND WERE NATURAL THEMSELVES SHAKESPEARE UNDERSTOOD MANKIND BECAUSE HE WAS HIMSELF A MAN HENCE HE HAS PORTRAYED THE FEELINGS THE EMOTIONS THE PASSIONS WITH A MASTER'S TOUCH
AND THE BRAMBLES PUSHED THE GLASSES SO CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES THAT HE COULD NOT OPEN THEM AND SO AS EVERY OTHER PART OF HIM WAS SCRATCHED AND BLEEDING AND HE COULD NOT OPEN HIS EYES HE MADE SURE THEY WERE SCRATCHED OUT
AND THE RECORD HE OR SHE HAS MADE THERE FOR INSTANCE IT WAS OPPORTUNE TO WRITE OF SULU AND THE LITTLE PACIFIC ARCHIPELAGO
ANY GREAT OCCURRENCE IS TAKING PLACE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
LIKE MYSELF HOWEVER SMALL LIKE MYSELF OR NOT AT ALL PUT YOURSELF IN PLACE OF THE READER AND WRITE WHAT WILL INTEREST YOURSELF
IF YOU DO NOT EAT PANCAKES ON THAT DAY YOU WILL HAVE NO LUCK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THE HENS WON'T LAY ET CETERA
OUR TOWN IS A QUIET LITTLE TOWN AND LIES NESTLING IN A LITTLE VALLEY SURROUNDED BY PRETTY GREEN HILLS I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD EVER HAVE HEARD OUR TOWN MENTIONED
IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO BLOW UP AN AMERICAN BATTLESHIP SAY IN THE HARBOR OF APPIA IN SAMOA IT AFFORDS A CHANCE TO WRITE ABOUT SAMOA
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING YOU'RE ASHAMED OF BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT
AND IN THE MORNING HE WAS NO NEARER THE ANSWER THAN BEFORE SO HE WAS OBLIGED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE WISE CHILD AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM I HAVE LOOKED AT THE SUBJECT FROM EVERY SIDE SAID HE
HAVING JUST ENOUGH EDUCATION TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES INTELLIGENTLY IN WRITING IT IS A MISTAKE TO IMAGINE AS SO MANY DO THAT AN EXTENDED EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR NEWSPAPER WORK NOT AT ALL
SAID SOLOMON LOOKING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE BIG MAN'S FACE WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE THAT REASSURED HIS FRIENDS HOW MANY SISTERS HAS A BOY WHO HAS ONE FATHER ONE MOTHER AND SEVEN BROTHERS
LEARN TOO HOW TO READ NATURE'S BOOK THERE'S A LESSON IN EVERYTHING IN THE STONES THE GRASS THE TREES THE BABBLING BROOKS AND THE SINGING BIRDS INTERPRET THE LESSON FOR YOURSELF THEN TEACH IT TO OTHERS
BREAK A BOTTLE OF WINE OVER HER FOR LUCK THE BOTTLE IS TO BE BROKEN BY A LADY
HE JUMPED INTO A BRAMBLE BUSH AND SCRATCHED OUT BOTH HIS EYES AND WHEN HE SAW HIS EYES WERE OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAIN HE JUMPED INTO ANOTHER BUSH AND SCRATCHED THEM IN AGAIN
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE DO SOMETHING USEFUL THAT OLD SOPHISTRY ABOUT THE WORLD OWING YOU A LIVING HAS BEEN EXPLODED LONG AGO THE WORLD DOES NOT OWE YOU A LIVING BUT YOU OWE IT SERVITUDE AND IF YOU DO NOT PAY THE DEBT
FOR I HAVE NEVER YET HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED TO THIS SUBJECT SO HE THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SAID I MUST REALLY GIVE IT UP I CANNOT TELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME WHY A MAN HAS TWO EYES
THAT IS ACROSS YOUR PATH IT MEANS A RIDE IF YOU PICK IT UP
WHEN YOU GET YOUR MANUSCRIPTS BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN DON'T DESPAIR NOR THINK THE EDITOR CRUEL AND UNKIND HE TOO HAS TROUBLES OF HIS OWN
BUT ALSO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE THE LABORER ON THE STREET CAN BE AS WELL POSTED ON THE NEWS OF THE DAY AS THE BANKER IN HIS OFFICE THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER HE CAN FEEL THE PULSE OF THE COUNTRY
TO WHICH TO SUBMIT YOUR COPY KNOW THE TONE AND GENERAL IMPORT OF THE PAPER ITS SOCIAL LEANINGS AND POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS
HE HAD MUCH THE ADVANTAGE IN SIZE THEY FORMED A CIRCLE AROUND THE TWO WISE MEN AND THEN BEGAN THE TRIAL TO SEE WHICH WAS THE WISEST TELL ME
IF A GREAT MAN LIVES NEAR YOU ONE WHOSE NAME IS ON THE TIP OF EVERY TONGUE
THEY WANT OUT OF THE WAY FACTS CURIOUS SCRAPS OF LORE PERSONAL NOTES OF FAMOUS OR ECCENTRIC PEOPLE
HAD NOT THE MAN LIVED THERE WHO WAS SO WISE THAT EVERYONE MARVELLED AT HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE HE WAS NOT ALWAYS A WISE MAN HE WAS A WISE BOY BEFORE HE GREW TO MANHOOD
HE WAS A VERY BIG MAN AND SOLOMON WAS A VERY LITTLE MAN AND SO THE PEOPLE ALL SHOOK THEIR HEADS SADLY AND FEARED SOLOMON HAD MET HIS MATCH FOR IF THE CUMBERLAND MAN WAS AS FULL OF WISDOM AS SOLOMON
ACT ACT LIKE A SOLDIER AND PROUDLY RUSH ON THE MOST VALIANT IN BRAVERY'S VAN WITH KEEN FLASHING SWORD CUT YOUR WAY TO THE FRONT AND SHOW TO THE WORLD YOU'RE A MAN
AND AS THE BIG MAN DID NOT DARE TO FOLLOW SOLOMON INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE TURNED AWAY AND RAN HOME TO CUMBERLAND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR TOWN WERE HORRIFIED WHEN THEY CAME UP AND FOUND THEIR WISE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRAMBLE BUSH
BE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL SUIT THE PASSING HOUR
BUT SOLOMON ALWAYS CAME OUT AHEAD AND MAINTAINED HIS REPUTATION FOR WISDOM FINALLY A VERY WISE MAN CAME FROM CUMBERLAND TO MEET SOLOMON AND SEE WHICH OF THEM WAS THE WISEST
PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
WHOSE RUMINATING REPOSE UPON THE HIGHWAY WE HAD RUTHLESSLY DISTURBED BUT IN THE DARKNESS OUR PROGRESS MORE THE GUIDANCE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT THAN ANY APPARENT VOLITION OF OUR OWN GAVE AN INDEFINABLE CHARM OF SECURITY TO OUR JOURNEY
HOW YOUR HUSBAND AND WESTLAKE AND GOULD DISLIKE ONE ANOTHER
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
IT IS SO DARK THAT WHEN I ALIGHT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF THE FOOTMAN WHO HOLDS THE CARRIAGE DOOR BUT WHAT OF THAT PESTE I AM HEAVY WITH SLEEP THE SAME OBSCURITY ALSO HIDES THE OLD FAMILIAR INDECENCIES OF THE STATUES ON THE TERRACE
BUT I WOULDN'T TELL HER MY HEART'S SECRETS IF I WERE YOU MY DEAR I INSIST THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PROFESSIONAL MAN'S WIFE IN THIS TOWN WHO DOESN'T PLOT AND THAT IS YOU YOU BLESSED CREDULOUS OUTSIDER I WON'T BE CAJOLED
I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
HAVE BORNE UP AGAINST THESE DEPRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION ON ME I STOOD WITH MY SHAWL AND CARPETBAG IN HAND GAZING DOUBTINGLY ON THE VEHICLE
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ME I LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE BOX SEAT BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE APPEAL I FLUNG MY CARPETBAG INTO THE CHASM DIVED RECKLESSLY AFTER IT AND BEFORE I WAS FAIRLY SEATED
THE INMATES OF THE EUREKA HOUSE FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE THERE WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION SO COMMON TO MANY HONEST PEOPLE THAT A SERIOUS STYLE OF DEPORTMENT AND CONDUCT TOWARD A STRANGER INDICATES HIGH GENTILITY AND ELEVATED STATION
TINKLED RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFIDENT AND UNCERTAIN TOUCH ON THE WHITE WALL THE SHADOW OF AN OLD AND SHARP PROFILE WAS BENDING OVER SEVERAL SYMMETRICAL AND SHADOWY CURLS I SEZ TO MARIAR MARIAR SEZ I
HE DROPPED INTO THE SHRIEKING DESK CHAIR HE LOOKED SQUARELY AT HER SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAN AND LONELY THEY WERE EMBARRASSED THEY ELABORATELY GLANCED AWAY AND WERE RELIEVED AS HE WENT ON
YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN REFUSING TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS SUMMING UP I'M A TEDIOUS OLD FOOL ANALYZING THE OBVIOUS WHILE YOU'RE THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION TELL ME YOUR SIDE WHAT IS GOPHER PRAIRIE TO YOU A BORE
THAT'S ALL OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A LIVING DEAD MAN EXCEPT THE DIVERTING LAST CHAPTER THE LIES ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN A TOWER OF STRENGTH AND LEGAL WISDOM WHICH SOME DAY A PREACHER WILL SPIN OVER MY LEAN DRY BODY
WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
I PICKED IT UP WITH AN INTEREST THAT HOWEVER SOON ABATED THERE WAS NO SCENT OF THE ROSES TO CLING TO IT STILL NOT EVEN OF HAIR OIL NO BEND OR TWIST IN ITS RIGID ANGLES BETRAYED ANY TRAIT OF ITS WEARER'S CHARACTER
AND FEELING THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ASSUMING IN IMITATION OF A HUMBLE INSECT OF MY CHILDISH RECOLLECTION THAT SPHERICAL SHAPE WHICH COULD BEST RESIST THOSE IMPRESSIONS WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE MOON RIDING HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
A NUMBER OF INFINITESIMAL ANNOYANCES WINDING UP WITH THE RESOLUTE PERSISTENCY OF THE CLERK AT THE STAGE OFFICE TO ENTER MY NAME MISSPELT ON THE WAYBILL HAD NOT PREDISPOSED ME TO CHEERFULNESS
AND FOR FOUR YEARS I LIVED OH I WON'T RHAPSODIZE ABOUT NEW YORK IT WAS DIRTY AND NOISY AND BREATHLESS AND GHASTLY EXPENSIVE BUT COMPARED WITH THE MOLDY ACADEMY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN SMOTHERED I WENT TO SYMPHONIES TWICE A WEEK
YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SHALL PLEASE TRY THIS CHAIR SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE RUSTY OFFICE GAUNT STOVE SHELVES OF TAN LAW BOOKS DESK CHAIR FILLED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO LONG SAT UPON
USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED THE SMELL OF PATCHOULI OR OF FACTORY SMOKE ARE JUST AS SUSPICIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS I WONDER IF THE SMALL TOWN ISN'T WITH SOME LOVELY EXCEPTIONS A SOCIAL APPENDIX SOME DAY THESE DULL MARKET TOWNS MAY BE AS OBSOLETE AS MONASTERIES
SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS GUY POLLOCK I'M AWFULLY SORRY MISSUS KENNICOTT BUT I DON'T KNOW WON'T YOU COME IN AND WAIT FOR THEM
RESCUED BY THE ANGEL I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF WHO IS THE ASSUMED DAUGHTER OF THE BRIGAND BUT THE REAL DAUGHTER OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AGAIN IN THE VAIN HOPE OF DISTINGUISHING THE DRIVER
THEN I FOUND THAT THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ABSOLUTE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE NEW STREETS AND YOUNGER MEN REAL COMPETITION IT WAS TOO EASY TO GO ON MAKING OUT CONVEYANCES AND ARGUING DITCHING CASES SO
INEQUALITIES OF THE ROAD ONLY QUICKENED ITS UTTERANCE OR DRAWLED IT TO AN EXASPERATING LENGTH IT WAS OF NO USE TO CONSIDER THE STATEMENT SERIOUSLY IT WAS OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO IT INDIGNANTLY
BUT ALSO IN SKATING I'LL SKATE WITH THEM OR SLIDE OR THROW SNOWBALLS JUST AS GLADLY AS TALK WITH YOU OH NO YES BUT THEY WANT TO STAY HOME AND EMBROIDER PERHAPS I'M NOT DEFENDING THE TOWN
PARBLEU DRAW MY RAPIER AND DIE VALOROUSLY I AM FOUND A WEEK OR TWO AFTER OUTSIDE A DESERTED CABARET NEAR THE BARRIER WITH A HOLE THROUGH MY RUFFLED LINEN AND MY POCKETS STRIPPED NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I AM RESCUED
CHAMP IS THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM JOINING YOU IN SYMBOLIC DANCING OR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DIESEL ENGINE NO HE'S A DEAR SOUL BLESS HIM BUT HE BELONGS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
IT WAS RETICENT AND UNSWERVING IN ITS UPRIGHT FIDELITY AND AT LAST SLIPPED LISTLESSLY THROUGH MY FINGERS I HAD DOZED REPEATEDLY WAKED ON THE THRESHOLD OF OBLIVION BY CONTACT WITH SOME OF THE ANGLES OF THE COACH
OBEYING THIS PRINCIPLE ALL HILARITY CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE TO SUPPER AND GENERAL REMARK MERGED INTO THE SAFER AND UNCOMPROMISING CHRONICLE OF SEVERAL BAD CASES OF DIPHTHERIA THEN EPIDEMIC AT WINGDAM
LUNATICS HAD NOT YET REACHED SUCH DEPTH OF IMBECILITY AS TO RIDE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL IN CALIFORNIA STAGES AND MY LAURA AMIABLE AND LONG SUFFERING AS SHE ALWAYS IS COULD NOT I FEAR
AND IN THE GLOOMY ABYSS THE SWAYING STRAPS BECKONED ME LIKE GHOSTLY HANDS TO COME IN NOW AND HAVE MY SUFFERINGS OUT AT ONCE I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THE OCCURRENCE OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH STRUCK ME AS APPALLING AND MYSTERIOUS
AND THE NIGHT AND ITS SHADOWS MOVED SOLEMNLY UPON US TO SAY IT WAS DARK EXPRESSED BUT FAINTLY THE PITCHY OBSCURITY THAT ENCOMPASSED THE VEHICLE THE ROADSIDE TREES WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AS DEEPER MASSES OF SHADOW
HERE A STRANGER IS TAKEN IN IF HE IS CORRECT IF HE LIKES HUNTING AND MOTORING AND GOD AND OUR SENATOR THERE WE DIDN'T TAKE IN EVEN OUR OWN TILL WE HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY GOT USED TO THEM
HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
HAD BEGUN TO SEPARATE THE FORMLESS MASSES OF THE SHADOWY LANDSCAPE TREES ISOLATED IN CLUMPS AND ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED PLACES BEFORE MY WINDOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE DISTANT HILLS CAME BACK AS IN DAYLIGHT
LET ME ASSURE THE READER THAT I HAVE NO ULTERIOR DESIGN IN MAKING THIS ASSERTION
I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
CAN I HELP HOW COULD YOU I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BY LISTENING I HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT BUT NORMALLY CAN'T I BE THE CONFIDANT OF THE OLD FRENCH PLAYS THE TIRING MAID WITH THE MIRROR AND THE LOYAL EARS
FAUSTUS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED HIS AGONIZING PRAYER WHEN A SUDDEN SPASM OF ACTIVITY ATTACKED MY DRIVER A SUCCESSION OF WHIP SNAPPINGS LIKE A PACK OF CHINESE CRACKERS BROKE FROM THE BOX BEFORE ME THE STAGE LEAPED FORWARD
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
WHERE ONE OF THE OTHERS HAS CONTINUED TO CALL ON PATIENTS LONGER THAN NECESSARY HE HAS LAUGHED ABOUT IT BUT HE STILL GRINNED NO REALLY AND WHEN YOU SAY THE WIVES OF THE DOCTORS SHARE THESE JEALOUSIES
WHEN I STRETCHED OUT MY LIMBS IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES FOR MAKING SEVERAL PEOPLE DISTINCTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MY INDIVIDUAL FRAME AT LAST RESTING MY ARMS ON THE STRAPS
MAY I JOIN YOU IN THE HONOR OF HAVING SOMETHING THE MATTER YES THANKS NO I THINK IT'S THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SKATING MORE THAN BIOLOGY BUT I'M NOT ONLY MORE INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY THAN THE JOLLY SEVENTEEN
HE GRINNED OH MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WILL HAS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF A CASE WHERE DOCTOR
IT WAS OF NO USE TO RECALL THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE PRAISE TO THE FACE HAD REDOUNDED TO THE EVERLASTING HONOR OF PRAISER AND BEPRAISED OF NO USE TO DWELL SENTIMENTALLY ON MODEST GENIUS AND COURAGE LIFTED UP AND STRENGTHENED BY OPEN COMMENDATION
WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF SOME OTHER ANNOYANCE THAT HAD BEEN FORCING ITSELF UPON ME FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HOW QUIET THE DRIVER WAS WAS THERE ANY DRIVER HAD I ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT LYING GAGGED AND BOUND ON THE ROADSIDE
EVEN IN THE DARKNESS THE RED DUST OF WINGDAM WAS VISIBLE ON ITS ROOF AND SIDES AND THE RED SLIME OF SLUMGULLION CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO ITS WHEELS I OPENED THE DOOR THE STAGE CREAKED EASILY
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED
DESERVES TO BE DETECTED I AM RELIEVED TO SAY THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED TO ME THE ROAD FROM WINGDAM TO SLUMGULLION KNEW NO OTHER BANDITTI THAN THE REGULARLY LICENSED HOTELKEEPERS
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE IN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT IT WEAKLY AS WE TOO OFTEN TREAT OTHER ILLUSIONS OF DARKNESS AND NECESSITY FOR THE TIME BEING
WHEN I GET HOLD OF ONE IN CHICAGO YET I SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO HOLD YOUR HAND I'M BROKEN IT'S THE HISTORICAL ANGLO SAXON WAY OF MAKING LIFE MISERABLE
THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE AT LEAST WITH THE RULING CLASS THERE IS A RULING CLASS DESPITE ALL OUR PROFESSIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PENALTY WE TRIBAL RULERS PAY IS THAT OUR SUBJECTS WATCH US EVERY MINUTE
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A PATENT LAWYER FROM CHICAGO AND I REALIZED THAT I'D ALWAYS FELT SO SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE LIKE JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH BUT I SAW THAT I WAS AS PROVINCIAL AND BEHIND THE TIMES AS JULIUS WORSE
MAYBE HE WILL NOW YOU'RE HOME YOU ALWAYS CHEER HIM UP ANNE LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE AND TOOK MARILLA'S FACE IN HER HANDS YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AS WELL YOURSELF AS I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MARILLA YOU LOOK TIRED I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEM PESKY GRITS ARE DOING I'M A CONSERVATIVE ANNE AND I TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THEM GRITS MISTER HARRISON HAD BROUGHT THE MAIL AND MERRY LETTERS FROM STELLA AND PRISCILLA AND PHIL SOON DISSIPATED ANNE'S BLUES AUNT JAMESINA TOO HAD WRITTEN
DIANA WAS AT GREEN GABLES TO MEET HER IN HER OWN WHITE ROOM WHERE MARILLA HAD SET A FLOWERING HOUSE ROSE ON THE WINDOW SILL ANNE LOOKED ABOUT HER AND DREW A LONG BREATH OF HAPPINESS OH DIANA IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK AGAIN
SO FREE FROM SHADOW AND SO LAVISH OF BLOSSOM ANNE SPENT SOME OF ITS RICH HOURS IN THE ORCHARD SHE WENT TO THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE AND WILLOWMERE AND VIOLET VALE SHE CALLED AT THE MANSE AND HAD A SATISFYING TALK WITH MISSUS ALLAN AND FINALLY IN THE EVENING
IN TEN MORE MINUTES SHE WOULD KNOW WHO HAD WON THE MEDAL AND WHO THE AVERY BEYOND THOSE TEN MINUTES THERE DID NOT SEEM JUST THEN TO BE ANYTHING WORTH BEING CALLED TIME OF COURSE YOU'LL WIN ONE OF THEM ANYHOW SAID JANE
FORTUNATELY SHE FELL ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE ROOF EXTENDED DOWN OVER THE PORCH SO NEARLY TO THE GROUND THAT A FALL THEREFROM WAS A MUCH LESS SERIOUS THING NEVERTHELESS WHEN DIANA AND THE OTHER GIRLS HAD RUSHED FRANTICALLY AROUND THE HOUSE
AT GREEN GABLES MARILLA WENT PROMPTLY TO MISSUS LYNDE'S DOMAIN WHEN GILBERT CAME AND INSISTED ON TAKING THE TWINS WITH HER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND ANNE WAS IN A HELPLESS FURY OVER IT DAVY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY
JANE WAS SMILING AND HAPPY EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER AND SHE WAS COMFORTABLY SURE SHE HAD MADE A PASS AT LEAST FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS TROUBLED JANE NOT AT ALL SHE HAD NO SOARING AMBITIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOT AFFECTED WITH THE UNREST ATTENDANT THEREON
I'VE GOT A PAIN SO OFTEN NOW BEHIND MY EYES DOCTOR SPENCER'S BEEN FUSSING WITH GLASSES BUT THEY DON'T DO ME ANY GOOD THERE IS A DISTINGUISHED OCULIST COMING TO THE ISLAND THE LAST OF JUNE AND THE DOCTOR SAYS I MUST SEE HIM I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO I CAN'T READ OR SEW WITH ANY COMFORT NOW
AND SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN AT ALL SHE SAYS IT UNFITS THEM FOR WOMAN'S TRUE SPHERE I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT SPEAKING OF RACHEL REMINDS ME DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE ABBEY BANK LATELY ANNE I HEARD IT WAS SHAKY ANSWERED ANNE WHY
THAT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT WASN'T WORTH A DARE RELUCTANT ADMIRATION GREETED HER EXPLOIT FOR MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE IT HAVING SUFFERED MANY THINGS THEMSELVES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO WALK FENCES JOSIE DESCENDED FROM HER PERCH FLUSHED WITH VICTORY AND DARTED A DEFIANT GLANCE AT ANNE
TERRIFIED SHRIEK IF ANNE HAD TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF ON THE SIDE UP WHICH SHE HAD ASCENDED
AS IF ALL THE STRAY GLEAMS OF LIGHT WERE CONCENTRATING IN ONE SPOT THE DISTANT HILLS RIMMED WITH PRIEST LIKE FIRS STOOD OUT IN DARK DISTINCTNESS AGAINST IT ANNE LOOKED ACROSS THE STILL WHITE FIELDS COLD AND LIFELESS IN THE HARSH LIGHT OF THAT GRIM SUNSET
I THINK IT'S QUITE NATURAL THAT A NINE YEAR OLD BOY WOULD SOONER READ AN ADVENTURE STORY THAN THE BIBLE BUT WHEN YOU ARE OLDER
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THAT STELLA MAYNARD BETTER THAN ME SAID DIANA REPROACHFULLY JOSIE PYE TOLD ME YOU DID
WHEN ANNE HAD FINISHED HER ESSAY IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN GLAD RETORTED MARILLA YOU DO LIKE TO RUB THINGS IN MATTHEW CUTHBERT MISS BARRY WHO WAS SITTING BEHIND THEM LEANED FORWARD AND POKED MARILLA IN THE BACK WITH HER PARASOL AREN'T YOU PROUD OF THAT ANNE GIRL
IT'S ONLY THAT I'M GETTING OLD ANNE AND KEEP FORGETTING IT WELL WELL I'VE ALWAYS WORKED PRETTY HARD AND I'D RATHER DROP IN HARNESS IF I HAD BEEN THE BOY YOU SENT FOR SAID ANNE WISTFULLY I'D BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SO MUCH NOW AND SPARE YOU IN A HUNDRED WAYS
I SHALL BE SO GLAD WHEN I CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR I'VE HEARD SUCH EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER THE GIRLS ALL THINK SHE IS PERFECTLY SWEET DIANA SAYS SHE HAS THE LOVELIEST FAIR CURLY HAIR AND SUCH FASCINATING EYES SHE DRESSES BEAUTIFULLY AND HER SLEEVE PUFFS ARE BIGGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S IN AVONLEA
FOR THE OLD WAY THROUGH THE HAUNTED WOOD WAS IMPASSABLE WITH DRIFTS AND THE LONG WAY OVER THE FROZEN LAKE OF SHINING WATERS WAS ALMOST AS BAD RUBY GILLIS WAS SLEEPING IN THE WHITE HEAPED GRAVEYARD JANE ANDREWS WAS TEACHING A SCHOOL ON WESTERN PRAIRIES GILBERT TO BE SURE WAS STILL FAITHFUL
IT WILL HELP ME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY I EXPECT WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY IMAGINATION DO WHEN THEY BREAK THEIR BONES DO YOU SUPPOSE MARILLA ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED BUT SHE WAS NOT SOLELY DEPENDENT ON IT
AND YELLING AT THE TOPS OF THEIR VOICES HURRAH FOR BLYTHE MEDALIST FOR A MOMENT ANNE FELT ONE SICKENING PANG OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT SO SHE HAD FAILED AND GILBERT HAD WON
ALL THE FIFTH CLASS GIRLS SAID OH PARTLY IN EXCITEMENT PARTLY IN DISMAY DON'T YOU DO IT ANNE ENTREATED DIANA YOU'LL FALL OFF AND BE KILLED NEVER MIND JOSIE PYE IT ISN'T FAIR TO DARE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING SO DANGEROUS I MUST DO IT
AT THAT MOMENT MARILLA HAD A REVELATION IN THE SUDDEN STAB OF FEAR THAT PIERCED HER VERY HEART SHE REALIZED WHAT ANNE HAD COME TO MEAN TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE LIKED ANNE NAY THAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF ANNE BUT NOW SHE KNEW AS SHE HURRIED WILDLY DOWN THE SLOPE
WHAT IS THE MATTER ANNE ASKED MARILLA MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY IS DEAD SAID ANNE IN A LOW TONE SO SHE HAS GONE AT LAST SAID MARILLA WELL SHE HAS BEEN SICK FOR OVER A YEAR
AND THERE SEEMED LITTLE PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH IN THE SUMMER VACATION I SUPPOSE I'LL JUST HAVE TO DROP OUT NEXT YEAR SHE THOUGHT DREARILY AND TEACH A DISTRICT SCHOOL AGAIN UNTIL I EARN ENOUGH TO FINISH MY COURSE
OH IT'S JUST GLORIOUS TO THINK OF IT JOSIE PYE SAYS SHE HATES IT BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE JOSIE HAS SO LITTLE IMAGINATION DIANA AND RUBY GILLIS AND JANE ANDREWS ARE PREPARING A DIALOGUE CALLED A MORNING VISIT FOR NEXT FRIDAY
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE TIME HE BROKE HIS ANKLE WHEN HE WAS A BOY IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF SUPERINTENDENT BELL EVER BEING A BOY EVEN MY IMAGINATION HAS ITS LIMITS FOR I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WHEN I TRY TO IMAGINE HIM AS A BOY I SEE HIM WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES
AND THEN THE GIRLS WERE AROUND THEM AND ANNE WAS THE CENTER OF A LAUGHING CONGRATULATING GROUP HER SHOULDERS WERE THUMPED
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE THOSE POINTED FIRS COMING OUT AGAINST THE PINK SKY AND THAT WHITE ORCHARD AND THE OLD SNOW QUEEN ISN'T THE BREATH OF THE MINT DELICIOUS AND THAT TEA ROSE
AND WADED UP TO GREEN GABLES EVERY POSSIBLE EVENING BUT GILBERT'S VISITS WERE NOT WHAT THEY ONCE WERE ANNE ALMOST DREADED THEM IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO LOOK UP IN THE MIDST OF A SUDDEN SILENCE AND FIND GILBERT'S HAZEL EYES FIXED UPON HER
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GLORY AND THE DREAM ON THE MORNING WHEN THE FINAL RESULTS OF ALL THE EXAMINATIONS WERE TO BE POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD AT QUEEN'S ANNE AND JANE WALKED DOWN THE STREET TOGETHER
I AM SHE SAID ANNE WENT HOME TO AVONLEA WITH MATTHEW AND MARILLA THAT EVENING SHE HAD NOT BEEN HOME SINCE APRIL AND SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT WAIT ANOTHER DAY THE APPLE BLOSSOMS WERE OUT AND THE WORLD WAS FRESH AND YOUNG
ANNE TOSSED HER RED BRAIDS I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A VERY WONDERFUL THING TO WALK A LITTLE LOW BOARD FENCE SHE SAID I KNEW A GIRL IN MARYSVILLE WHO COULD WALK THE RIDGEPOLE OF A ROOF I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID JOSIE FLATLY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD WALK A RIDGEPOLE
THERE THERE I'M NOT CROSS SAID MARILLA YOU'RE AN UNLUCKY CHILD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT AS YOU SAY YOU'LL HAVE THE SUFFERING OF IT HERE NOW TRY AND EAT SOME SUPPER ISN'T IT FORTUNATE I'VE GOT SUCH AN IMAGINATION SAID ANNE
ON THE DAY WHEN SHE COULD FIRST LIMP ACROSS THE FLOOR IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT TO BE LAID UP BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO IT MARILLA YOU FIND OUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE WHY EVEN SUPERINTENDENT BELL CAME TO SEE ME AND HE'S REALLY A VERY FINE MAN NOT A KINDRED SPIRIT OF COURSE
THAN ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE WHO HAS NEVER TRIED IT BUT JOSIE PYE IF DEFICIENT IN SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR POPULARITY HAD AT LEAST A NATURAL AND INBORN GIFT DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES JOSIE WALKED THE BARRY FENCE WITH AN AIRY UNCONCERN WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY
A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THEIR GAMES AND RIPE FOR ANY ENTICING FORM OF MISCHIEF WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF THIS PRESENTLY TOOK THE FORM OF DARING DARING WAS THE FASHIONABLE AMUSEMENT AMONG THE AVONLEA SMALL FRY JUST THEN IT HAD BEGUN AMONG THE BOYS BUT SOON SPREAD TO THE GIRLS
SHE WON'T BE NEW ANY MORE BY THE TIME I'M ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GIL EVERYBODY WILL GET AHEAD OF ME IN CLASS OH I AM AN AFFLICTED MORTAL
SO HE MEANS TO EARN HIS OWN WAY THROUGH I EXPECT HE'LL GET THE SCHOOL HERE IF MISS AMES DECIDES TO LEAVE ANNE FELT A QUEER LITTLE SENSATION OF DISMAYED SURPRISE SHE HAD NOT KNOWN THIS
SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE STUMBLED STAGGERED AND FELL SLIDING DOWN OVER THE SUN BAKED ROOF AND CRASHING OFF IT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF VIRGINIA CREEPER BENEATH ALL BEFORE THE DISMAYED CIRCLE BELOW COULD GIVE A SIMULTANEOUS
BUT THERE'S NOTHING EXCEPT MILLIONAIRES ON THIS STREET SO I'LL STAY HERE AND KEEP PATTY'S PLACE WARM FOR YOU
AND HE'D ALWAYS BANKED WITH HIM MATTHEW SAID ANY BANK WITH HIM AT THE HEAD OF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY I THINK HE HAS ONLY BEEN ITS NOMINAL HEAD FOR MANY YEARS SAID ANNE HE IS A VERY OLD MAN HIS NEPHEWS ARE REALLY AT THE HEAD OF THE INSTITUTION WELL WHEN RACHEL TOLD US THAT
YOU MUST TAKE A REST NOW THAT I'M HOME I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE DAY OFF TO VISIT ALL THE DEAR OLD SPOTS AND HUNT UP MY OLD DREAMS AND THEN IT WILL BE YOUR TURN TO BE LAZY WHILE I DO THE WORK MARILLA SMILED AFFECTIONATELY AT HER GIRL IT'S NOT THE WORK IT'S MY HEAD
BUT I THINK I AM RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS WHERE SOBBED CARRIE SLOANE OH WHERE ANNE BEFORE ANNE COULD ANSWER MISSUS BARRY APPEARED ON THE SCENE AT SIGHT OF HER ANNE TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO HER FEET BUT SANK BACK AGAIN WITH A SHARP LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
AND HE WON'T SPARE HIMSELF A MITE I'VE BEEN REAL WORRIED ABOUT HIM BUT HE'S SOME BETTER THIS WHILE BACK AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD HIRED MAN
ANNE LAUGHED AND PELTED DIANA WITH THE FADED JUNE LILIES OF HER BOUQUET STELLA MAYNARD IS THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD EXCEPT ONE AND YOU ARE THAT ONE DIANA SHE SAID I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER AND I'VE SO MANY THINGS TO TELL YOU
THE THREE CATS THE MERRY CHATTER OF THE GIRLS THE PLEASANTNESS OF FRIDAY EVENINGS WHEN COLLEGE FRIENDS DROPPED IN TO TALK OF GRAVE AND GAY ANNE WAS LONELY DIANA DURING THE WHOLE OF THE HOLIDAYS WAS IMPRISONED AT HOME WITH A BAD ATTACK OF BRONCHITIS SHE COULD NOT COME TO GREEN GABLES
OR A VOLCANIC EXPLOSION WHICH BLEW HIM HIGH AND DRY OUT OF HIS TROUBLES LANDED HIM IN A FORTUNE
A WEEK AFTER THE TEA AT THE MANSE DIANA BARRY GAVE A PARTY SMALL AND SELECT ANNE ASSURED MARILLA JUST THE GIRLS IN OUR CLASS THEY HAD A VERY GOOD TIME AND NOTHING UNTOWARD HAPPENED UNTIL AFTER TEA WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE BARRY GARDEN
AND LET THEM DARE AWAY SUCH ABSURDITY SAID MARILLA ANNE SIGHED BUT YOU HAVE SUCH STRENGTH OF MIND MARILLA I HAVEN'T I JUST FELT THAT I COULDN'T BEAR JOSIE PYE'S SCORN
SHE WAS PUSHED AND PULLED AND HUGGED AND AMONG IT ALL SHE MANAGED TO WHISPER TO JANE OH WON'T MATTHEW AND MARILLA BE PLEASED I MUST WRITE THE NEWS HOME RIGHT AWAY COMMENCEMENT WAS THE NEXT IMPORTANT HAPPENING THE EXERCISES WERE HELD IN THE BIG ASSEMBLY HALL OF THE ACADEMY
AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED SO MUCH THAT YOU NEEDN'T BE VERY CROSS WITH ME MARILLA IT'S NOT A BIT NICE TO FAINT AFTER ALL AND THE DOCTOR HURT ME DREADFULLY WHEN HE WAS SETTING MY ANKLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO AROUND FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL MISS THE NEW LADY TEACHER
SUITED HER SPRINGING STEP TO HIS YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD TODAY MATTHEW SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY WHY WON'T YOU TAKE THINGS EASIER WELL NOW I CAN'T SEEM TO SAID MATTHEW
AWFUL OLD GOSSIP COMPLETED DAVY CALMLY THAT'S WHAT EVERY ONE CALLS HER BUT IS IT A SURE THING ANNE I WANT TO KNOW YOU'RE A VERY SILLY LITTLE BOY DAVY SAID ANNE STALKING HAUGHTILY OUT OF THE ROOM THE KITCHEN WAS DESERTED
SHE'S THE WOMAN YOU AND DIANA LIT ON WHEN YOU JUMPED INTO THE SPARE ROOM BED AIN'T SHE DIANA TOLD ME THAT STORY IS THAT WHY SHE LEFT YOU SO MUCH
WOULD YOU SMILED ANNE DAVY PEERED CURIOUSLY AT HER YOU DON'T SEEM A BIT SHOCKED ANNE MISSUS LYNDE WAS AWFUL SHOCKED WHEN I SAID IT TO HER NO I'M NOT SHOCKED DAVY
JOSIE'S TRIUMPH BEING RATHER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN GOOD TASTE PERMITTED ANNE SHIRLEY DARED HER TO WALK ALONG THE TOP OF THE BOARD FENCE WHICH BOUNDED THE GARDEN TO THE EAST NOW TO WALK BOARD FENCES REQUIRES MORE SKILL AND STEADINESS OF HEAD AND HEEL
SHE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR ON HER WAY TO THE KITCHEN MISTER VERLOC WOULD WANT HIS TEA PRESENTLY CONFIDENT OF THE POWER OF HER CHARMS WINNIE DID NOT EXPECT FROM HER HUSBAND IN THE DAILY INTERCOURSE OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE
ALREADY MISSUS VERLOC WAS REGRETTING HER WORDS THEY HAD SOUNDED MORE UNKIND THAN SHE MEANT THEM TO BE THEY HAD ALSO THE UNWISDOM OF UNNECESSARY THINGS IN FACT SHE HAD NOT MEANT THEM AT ALL
BECAUSE IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTER VERLOC WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM INSIDE UNDOING THE STRINGS OF HER APRON WITH A JERK SHE THREW IT ON A CHAIR AND WALKED BACK TO THE PARLOUR SLOWLY AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT MISTER VERLOC ENTERED FROM THE SHOP
COVERED WITH BROWN OIL CLOTH WINNIE HIS WIFE TALKED EVENLY AT HIM THE WIFELY TALK AS ARTFULLY ADAPTED NO DOUBT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS RETURN AS THE TALK OF PENELOPE TO THE RETURN OF THE WANDERING ODYSSEUS MISSUS VERLOC HOWEVER
MISSUS VERLOC ROSE AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO STOP THAT NONSENSE AND SHE DID IT FIRMLY BUT GENTLY SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT DIRECTLY MISSUS NEALE RECEIVED HER MONEY
HE TOOK DOWN A SMALL
IT WAS IN ALL ESSENTIALS OF DOMESTIC PROPRIETY AND DOMESTIC COMFORT A RESPECTABLE HOME HER DEVOTED AFFECTION MISSED OUT OF IT HER BROTHER STEVIE NOW ENJOYING A DAMP VILLEGIATURE IN THE KENTISH LANES UNDER THE CARE OF MISTER MICHAELIS
AND BRINGING IN HER BROTHER STEVIE AS SOON AS SHE COULD INTO THE CURRENT OF DOMESTIC EVENTS SHE MENTIONED THAT THE BOY HAD MOPED A GOOD DEAL IT'S ALL ALONG OF MOTHER LEAVING US LIKE THIS MISTER VERLOC NEITHER SAID DAMN
THIS WAS A CHANGE BUT IT WAS NO IMPROVEMENT MISSUS VERLOC INCLUDING ALL THESE VAGARIES UNDER THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF EXCITEMENT BEGAN TO FEAR THAT STEVIE WAS HEARING MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM OF HER HUSBAND'S CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS FRIENDS
ONLY THEN SHE PEEPED IN AT THE AMOUNT DRAWING THE NOTES OUT FOR THE PURPOSE AFTER THIS INSPECTION SHE LOOKED ROUND THOUGHTFULLY WITH AN AIR OF MISTRUST IN THE SILENCE AND SOLITUDE OF THE HOUSE THIS ABODE OF HER MARRIED LIFE APPEARED TO HER
PROPPED UP ON HIS TWO ARMS AS THOUGH HE WERE FEELING GIDDY OR SICK SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ADOLF SHE CALLED OUT HALF ALOUD AND WHEN HE HAD RAISED HIMSELF DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN SHE ASKED RAPIDLY I'VE HEARD OF HIM
ONLY HE SUPPOSED HIS WIFE COULD NOT GET ON WITHOUT HIM COULD NOT GET ON WITHOUT HIM REPEATED MISSUS VERLOC SLOWLY I COULDN'T GET ON WITHOUT HIM IF IT WERE FOR HIS GOOD
AND HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS TO COME UPON HIS PALLID FACE WITH ITS BIG EYES GLEAMING IN THE DUSK WAS DISCOMPOSING TO THINK OF HIM UP THERE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE MISTER VERLOC GOT USED TO THE STARTLING NOVELTY OF THE IDEA
BUSY FISHING FOR HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE GOT IT FROM UNDER THE SOFA HE HELD IT AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE USE OF A HAT WELL HE'S WAITING FOR YOU SAID MISSUS VERLOC AT LAST I SAY ADOLF
MISTER VERLOC UNCOVERED HIS HEAD BEFORE HIS EXTENDED ARM COULD PUT DOWN THE HAT STEVIE POUNCED UPON IT AND BORE IT OFF REVERENTLY INTO THE KITCHEN AND AGAIN MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED
YOU COULDN'T YOU WOULD MISS ME TOO MUCH MISTER VERLOC STARTED FORWARD EXACTLY HE SAID IN A LOUDER TONE THROWING HIS ARMS OUT AND MAKING A STEP TOWARDS HER SOMETHING WILD AND DOUBTFUL IN HIS EXPRESSION
AND THAT ANYHOW HE DID NOT CARE THE PROPOSAL AS TO SLIPPERS WAS DISREGARDED AS BENEATH HIS NOTICE BUT THE QUESTION OF GOING OUT IN THE EVENING RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT
TACITURN STILL HE WAS NOT SO LISTLESS MISSUS VERLOC THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RATHER JUMPY AT TIMES IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN IMPROVEMENT AS TO STEVIE HE MOPED NO LONGER AT THE FOOT OF THE CLOCK BUT MUTTERED TO HIMSELF IN CORNERS INSTEAD
WHOM SHE HAD RECEIVED CURTLY ENTRENCHED BEHIND THE COUNTER WITH A STONY FACE AND A FARAWAY GAZE SHE SAID NOTHING HER MENTAL REFERENCE TO THE ROBUST ANARCHIST BEING MARKED BY A SHORT PAUSE WITH THE FAINTEST POSSIBLE BLUSH
SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF STILL MORE ON OBSERVING IN THE COURSE OF DAYS THAT MISTER VERLOC SEEMED TO BE TAKING KINDLY TO STEVIE'S COMPANIONSHIP NOW WHEN READY TO GO OUT FOR HIS WALK MISTER VERLOC CALLED ALOUD TO THE BOY
GET RID OF THE MAN WHOEVER HE IS AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND COME BACK HOME TO ME YOU WANT LOOKING AFTER FOR A DAY OR TWO MISTER VERLOC CALMED DOWN AND WITH RESOLUTION IMPRINTED ON HIS PALE FACE HAD ALREADY OPENED THE DOOR WHEN HIS WIFE CALLED HIM BACK IN A WHISPER
THEN HE MURMURED A FEW OMINOUS GENERALITIES ON THE THEME OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO
MADE IT APPEAR UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MEANT TO STRANGLE OR TO EMBRACE HIS WIFE BUT MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY FROM THAT MANIFESTATION BY THE CLATTER OF THE SHOP BELL SHOP ADOLF YOU GO HE STOPPED
MISSUS VERLOC OBSERVED WITH KNOWLEDGE THERE'S MISSUS NEALE AT IT AGAIN WITH HER HARROWING TALES ABOUT HER LITTLE CHILDREN
SHE MISSED HIM POIGNANTLY WITH ALL THE FORCE OF HER PROTECTING PASSION THIS WAS THE BOY'S HOME TOO THE ROOF THE CUPBOARD THE STOKED GRATE ON THIS THOUGHT
AND MISSUS VERLOC IN HER VARIED EXPERIENCE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME FOREIGNERS COULD SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH THAN THE NATIVES SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR FIXEDLY YOU DON'T THINK PERHAPS OF STAYING IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD
MISTER VERLOC AGAINST HIS USUAL PRACTICE HAD THROWN OFF HIS OVERCOAT IT WAS LYING ON THE SOFA HIS HAT WHICH HE MUST ALSO HAVE THROWN OFF RESTED OVERTURNED UNDER THE EDGE OF THE SOFA
HE TURNED AWAY HIS HEAVY EYES SAYING HUSKILY WELL LET HIM COME ALONG THEN AND RELAPSED INTO THE CLUTCHES OF BLACK CARE THAT PERHAPS PREFERS TO SIT BEHIND A HORSEMAN BUT KNOWS ALSO HOW TO TREAD CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF PEOPLE NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL OFF TO KEEP HORSES
NOR YET STEVIE BE HANGED AND MISSUS VERLOC NOT LET INTO THE SECRET OF HIS THOUGHTS FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE GENEROSITY OF THIS RESTRAINT IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T WORK AS WELL AS EVER SHE CONTINUED HE'S BEEN MAKING HIMSELF VERY USEFUL
YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH DON'T YOU OH YES I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH THERE WAS NOTHING FOREIGN IN HIS ACCENT EXCEPT THAT HE SEEMED IN HIS SLOW ENUNCIATION TO BE TAKING PAINS WITH IT
IT WAS EARLY MORNING STEVIE DUSTING VARIOUS OBJECTS DISPLAYED IN THE FRONT WINDOWS TURNED TO GAPE AT HIM WITH REVERENCE AND AWE HERE SAID MISTER VERLOC GIVING A SLIGHT KICK TO THE GLADSTONE BAG ON THE FLOOR
HE ATE AS IF IN A PUBLIC PLACE HIS HAT PUSHED OFF HIS FOREHEAD THE SKIRTS OF HIS HEAVY OVERCOAT HANGING IN A TRIANGLE ON EACH SIDE OF THE CHAIR
YOU JUST GO ON AND HAVE YOUR WALK OUT DON'T WORRY
WHISPERED UNEASILY MISTER VERLOC DARTING A WILD GLANCE AT THE DOOR MISSUS VERLOC'S FINE INCURIOUS EYES LIGHTED UP WITH A FLASH OF ABHORRENCE ONE OF KARL YUNDT'S FRIENDS BEASTLY OLD MAN NO NO PROTESTED MISTER VERLOC
IT WAS A SORT OF PHRASE THAT IS SUGGESTED BY THE DEMON OF PERVERSE INSPIRATION BUT SHE KNEW A WAY TO MAKE IT AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
THIS OPTIMISM PROCURED FOR MISTER VERLOC HIS FOURTH SURPRISE OF THE DAY IS HE HE GRUNTED DOUBTFULLY BUT PERHAPS HIS BROTHER IN LAW WAS NOT SUCH AN IDIOT AS HE LOOKED HIS WIFE WOULD KNOW BEST
THROUGH THE DOOR LEFT AJAR SHE COULD SEE THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT GONE YET I FIND I'LL HAVE TO GO OUT THIS EVENING SAID MISTER VERLOC HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO PICK UP HIS OUTER GARMENT
ON THE POINT OF TAKING OUT THE JAM SHE REFLECTED PRACTICALLY HE WILL BE FEELING HUNGRY HAVING BEEN AWAY ALL DAY AND SHE RETURNED TO THE CUPBOARD ONCE MORE TO GET THE COLD BEEF SHE SET IT UNDER THE PURRING GAS JET AND WITH A PASSING GLANCE
AND SHE WAS SINCERE AND ON EACH SIDE OF HER THIN RED NOSE HER BLEARED MISTY EYES SWAM IN TEARS BECAUSE SHE FELT REALLY THE WANT OF SOME SORT OF STIMULANT IN THE MORNING IN THE PARLOUR
PEEPED IN TO SEE THAT THE CONTENTS WERE ALL RIGHT AND PUT IT DOWN GENTLY ON THE COUNTER NOT TILL THAT WAS DONE DID HE BREAK THE SILENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT MOST LIKELY STEVIE WOULD PROFIT GREATLY BY BEING SENT OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE
TALKED OF THE EMBASSY TO YOU MISTER VERLOC SEEMED SCARED AND BEWILDERED BEYOND MEASURE HIS WIFE EXPLAINED YOU'VE BEEN TALKING A LITTLE IN YOUR SLEEP OF LATE ADOLF WHAT WHAT DID I SAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW
FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT DAY MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED HE STARED STUPIDLY AT HIS WIFE SHE CONTINUED IN HER STEADY MANNER THE BOY WHENEVER HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING MOPED IN THE HOUSE
ANSWERED MISTER VERLOC IN A LOW CHOKED NASAL TONE HIS ATTITUDE SUGGESTED AGGRIEVED SULKS OR A SEVERE HEADACHE THE UNSUFFICIENCY AND UNCANDIDNESS OF HIS ANSWER BECAME PAINFULLY APPARENT IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE ROOM
THE STRANGER GAVE HER AGAIN A SILENT SMILE HE HAD A KINDLY MOUTH AND PROBING EYES AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD A LITTLE SADLY IT SEEMED MY HUSBAND WILL SEE YOU THROUGH ALL RIGHT MEANTIME FOR A
WALKED IN BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE DID NOT LOOK OVERTLY AT THE CUSTOMER TILL SHE HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF COMFORTABLY ON THE CHAIR BUT BY THAT TIME SHE HAD NOTED THAT HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND WORE HIS MOUSTACHES TWISTED UP
ONLY THE GAS JET ABOVE THE TABLE WENT ON PURRING EQUABLY IN THE BROODING SILENCE OF THE PARLOUR DURING THE CONTACT OF THAT UNEXPECTED AND LINGERING KISS MISTER VERLOC GRIPPING WITH BOTH HANDS THE EDGES OF HIS CHAIR
I WOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED YOU BOWED UNDER THE OVERMANTEL MISTER VERLOC HOLDING HIS HEAD IN BOTH HANDS SEEMED TO HAVE GONE TO SLEEP
THE EMBASSY PEOPLE I WOULD CUT THEIR HEARTS OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT LET THEM LOOK OUT I'VE GOT A TONGUE IN MY HEAD HE FUMED PACING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN THE TABLE AND THE SOFA HIS OPEN OVERCOAT CATCHING AGAINST THE ANGLES
PRESERVED A HIERATIC IMMOBILITY WHEN THE PRESSURE WAS REMOVED HE LET GO THE CHAIR ROSE AND WENT TO STAND BEFORE THE FIREPLACE HE TURNED NO LONGER HIS BACK TO THE ROOM WITH HIS FEATURES SWOLLEN AND AN AIR OF BEING DRUGGED
HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS FACE RED HIS FINGERS HAD RUFFLED HIS HAIR INTO A DISSIPATED UNTIDINESS ALTOGETHER HE HAD A DISREPUTABLE ASPECT EXPRESSIVE OF THE DISCOMFORT THE IRRITATION
AND SHE FOLLOWED IT WITH THE EVERLASTING PLAINT OF THE POOR PATHETICALLY MENDACIOUS MISERABLY AUTHENTICATED BY THE HORRIBLE BREATH OF CHEAP RUM AND SOAP SUDS SHE SCRUBBED HARD SNUFFLING ALL THE TIME AND TALKING VOLUBLY
WHAT ABOUT THAT MONEY YOU DREW OUT SHE ASKED YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOUR POCKET HADN'T YOU BETTER MISTER VERLOC GAZED STUPIDLY INTO THE PALM OF HIS WIFE'S EXTENDED HAND FOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE SLAPPED HIS BROW MONEY
FRANCE OR CALIFORNIA THE UTTER UNEXPECTEDNESS IMPROBABILITY AND INCONCEIVABLENESS OF SUCH AN EVENT ROBBED THIS VAGUE DECLARATION OF ALL ITS EFFECT
I'LL HAVE YOU LAID UP ON MY HANDS SHE SAID WITH GENUINE UNEASINESS I DON'T THINK SO REMARKED MISTER VERLOC SNUFFLING HUSKILY
AS LONELY AND UNSAFE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SITUATED IN THE MIDST OF A FOREST NO RECEPTACLE SHE COULD THINK OF AMONGST THE SOLID HEAVY FURNITURE SEEMED OTHER BUT FLIMSY AND PARTICULARLY TEMPTING TO HER CONCEPTION OF A HOUSE BREAKER
SOME OF THEM MUST BE BIG ENOUGH BY NOW TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES IT ONLY MAKES STEVIE ANGRY THESE WORDS WERE CONFIRMED BY A THUD AS OF A FIST STRIKING THE KITCHEN TABLE
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT SEEM TO REFUSE IT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPETENCY BUT THE GREAT PERSONAGE REMARKED ALL THIS SEEMS VERY FANTASTIC DOESN'T IT ONE WOULD THINK A FEROCIOUS JOKE
WITH OLD STOTT WARTENHEIM HIMSELF AND HAD COME TO REGARD HIS SERVICES AS INDISPENSABLE IT WAS AN EXTREMELY RUDE AWAKENING
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU EVER MET BEFORE SAID THE GREAT LADY MISTER VLADIMIR AND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTRODUCED ACKNOWLEDGED EACH OTHER'S EXISTENCE WITH PUNCTILIOUS AND GUARDED COURTESY
HE HAD HIS OWN CRUSADING INSTINCTS THIS AFFAIR WHICH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DISGUSTED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT SEEMED TO HIM A PROVIDENTIALLY GIVEN STARTING POINT FOR A CRUSADE HE HAD IT MUCH AT HEART TO BEGIN
CLEVER ENOUGH QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR THAT A SILENCE FELL THE MAN AT THE FOOT OF THE COUCH HAD STOPPED SPEAKING TO THE LADY AND LOOKED ON WITH A FAINT SMILE
SO THIS INSTRUCTIVE CRIME WAS PLANNED ABROAD MISTER VLADIMIR SAID QUICKLY YOU ADMIT IT WAS PLANNED ABROAD THEORETICALLY THEORETICALLY ONLY ON FOREIGN TERRITORY ABROAD ONLY BY A FICTION SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
IT LOOKED AS IF THE GREAT ASSAULT THREATENED FOR THAT NIGHT WERE GOING TO FIZZLE OUT AN INFERIOR HENCHMAN OF THAT BRUTE CHEESEMAN WAS UP BORING MERCILESSLY A VERY THIN HOUSE WITH SOME SHAMELESSLY COOKED STATISTICS
HONORARY MUTTERED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THROUGH HIS TEETH HEAVENS TOODLES LOOKED SO THUNDERSTRUCK THAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SMILED FAINTLY THAT'S BETWEEN OURSELVES STRICTLY HE SAID
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CANNOT COMPLAIN OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF OUR POLICE LOOK AT THIS OUTRAGE
IT'S A NOXIOUS RASCALLY LOOKING ALTOGETHER DETESTABLE BEAST WITH A SORT OF SMOOTH FACE AND MOUSTACHES DESCRIBED TO A T COMMENDED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ONLY MINE IS CLEAN SHAVEN ALTOGETHER YOU'VE SEEN HIM
MISTER VLADIMIR AFFECTING NOT TO LISTEN LEANED TOWARDS THE COUCH TALKING AMIABLY IN SUBDUED TONES BUT HE HEARD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SAY I'VE NO DOUBT THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HAS A VERY PRECISE NOTION OF THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AFFAIR
HE TOODLES HOPED HE WOULD BORE THEM INTO A COUNT OUT EVERY MINUTE
WHEN AT LAST HE GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE HE SAW WITH DISGUST THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN STILL STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT CAN HE BE WAITING FOR ME THOUGHT MISTER VLADIMIR LOOKING UP AND DOWN FOR SOME SIGNS OF A HANSOM
BUT THAT SENTIMENT WHICH RESEMBLED THE IRRATIONAL HORROR SOME PEOPLE HAVE OF CATS DID NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS IMMENSE CONTEMPT FOR THE ENGLISH POLICE HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE ADDRESSED TO THE GREAT LADY AND TURNED SLIGHTLY IN HIS CHAIR
THE THING'S BECOMING INDECENT AND DANGEROUS TOO FOR US HERE MISTER VLADIMIR STOPPED AGAIN FOR A MOMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO A COURSE OF ACTION ON WHICH I WISHED TO KNOW YOUR PRECISE INTENTIONS FIRST THE GREAT PERSONAGE ROSE HEAVILY AN IMPOSING SHADOWY FORM IN THE GREENISH GLOOM OF THE ROOM
IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE IDENTITY OF A MAN LITERALLY BLOWN TO SHREDS HAVE FOUND THE ORGANISER OF THE ATTEMPT AND HAVE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE INCITER BEHIND HIM
PERHAPS TO THE QUESTIONS OF HIS COUNTRY'S DOMESTIC POLICY THE BATTLE GROUND OF HIS CRUSADING VALOUR AGAINST THE PAYNIM CHEESEMAN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITHDREW QUIETLY UNNOTICED AS IF ALREADY FORGOTTEN
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO STAY AND TAKE ANNIE HOME SAID THE LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS I FIND THAT I'VE YET A LITTLE WORK TO DO TO NIGHT IN CONNECTION
IT IS RATHER A CURIOUS AFFAIR TOO LONG PERHAPS TO STATE FULLY JUST NOW WHAT THEN HAVE YOU LEARNED ASKED THE GREAT MAN FIRST I'VE LEARNED THAT THE EX CONVICT MICHAELIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
YES A GENUINE WIFE AND THE VICTIM WAS A GENUINE BROTHER IN LAW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A DOMESTIC DRAMA THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LAUGHED A LITTLE BUT THE GREAT MAN'S THOUGHTS SEEMED TO HAVE WANDERED FAR AWAY
WHICH UPON THE WHOLE HE BELIEVED TO BE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE ON HE STOOD ASIDE GO IN WITHOUT KNOCKING HE SAID
THE MAN FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING FLUNG HIMSELF ON MY BREAST IT WAS ENOUGH ON MY PART TO WHISPER TO HIM WHO I WAS AND TO ADD I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTERRUPTED THE APPRENTICE STATESMAN YES YES BUT A SPRAT IS ALSO THROWN AWAY SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO CATCH A WHALE A WHALE PHEW EXCLAIMED TOODLES WITH BATED BREATH YOU'RE AFTER A WHALE THEN
PAR EXCELLENCE IN THE MINDS OF MANY MILLIONS OF MEN HE WAS MET AT LAST BY THE VOLATILE AND REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES THAT NEAT AND NICE YOUNG MAN CONCEALED HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE EARLY APPEARANCE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
IT'S A WITTY FISH I HAVE SEEN HIM SAID TOODLES INCREDULOUSLY I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHERE I COULD HAVE SEEN HIM AT THE EXPLORERS I SHOULD SAY DROPPED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CALMLY
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INVITED TO TAKE A CHAIR SAT DOWN IN THE DIM LIGHT THE SALIENT POINTS OF HIS PERSONALITY THE LONG FACE THE BLACK HAIR HIS LANKNESS MADE HIM LOOK MORE FOREIGN THAN EVER
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I AM AFTER IS MORE LIKE A DOG FISH YOU DON'T KNOW PERHAPS WHAT A DOG FISH IS LIKE YES I DO WE'RE BURIED IN SPECIAL BOOKS UP TO OUR NECKS WHOLE SHELVES FULL OF THEM WITH PLATES
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE'VE GOT HOLD OF A MAN CALLED VERLOC HE ANNOUNCED CASUALLY
HE FINISHED DISPLAYING A DIMPLE ON EACH CLEAN SHAVEN CHEEK THEN HE ADDED MORE GRAVELY I MAY EVEN SAY BECAUSE YOU DO WHEN MISTER VLADIMIR CEASED SPEAKING THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOWERED HIS GLANCE
AS THOUGH HE WERE QUOTING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ALL THAT'S WANTED NOW IS TO DO AWAY WITH THE AGENT PROVOCATEUR TO MAKE EVERYTHING SAFE MISTER VLADIMIR HELD UP HIS HAND TO A PASSING HANSOM
YOU DID BUT THE FELLOW WILL DISAPPEAR PARDON ME I DON'T THINK SO WHERE COULD HE GO TO MOREOVER YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HE HAS GOT TO THINK OF THE DANGER FROM HIS COMRADES TOO HE'S THERE AT HIS POST
I'LL SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO NIGHT AND WILL SEND FOR YOU TO MORROW MORNING IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'D WISH TO TELL ME NOW THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HAD STOOD UP ALSO SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE I THINK NOT SIR ETHELRED UNLESS I WERE TO ENTER INTO DETAILS WHICH
AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIS IGNORANCE OF ALL OTHER INDUSTRIAL MATTERS IMMENSE
MISTER VLADIMIR ASKED HIMSELF WHAT THAT CONFOUNDED AND INTRUSIVE POLICEMAN WAS DRIVING AT DESCENDED FROM GENERATIONS VICTIMISED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF AN ARBITRARY POWER HE WAS RACIALLY
BUT OUR MAN TOOK IT SERIOUSLY IT APPEARS HE FELT HIMSELF THREATENED
WHOSE FACE APPEARED TO HIM MORE OMINOUSLY WOODEN THAN EVER BEFORE AND QUITE WONDERFULLY LONG WHAT A QUEER FOREIGN LOOKING CHAP HE IS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SMILING FROM A DISTANCE WITH FRIENDLY BUOYANCY
AND TOOK AWAY THE LAD ON THE PRETENCE OF GOING OUT FOR A WALK IN THE LANES AS IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HE DID THIS MICHAELIS COULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL FOR THE REST SIR ETHELRED
AFTER THIS PROFOUND OBSERVATION THE EXPERIENCED TOODLES SEEMED TO REFLECT AT ANY RATE HE SAID NOTHING FOR QUITE TWO SECONDS THEN I'M GLAD
WHOSE ENUNCIATION WAS CARESSING AND SLOW APROPOS OF THIS EXPLOSION IN GREENWICH PARK IT APPEARS WE ALL OUGHT TO QUAKE IN OUR SHOES AT WHAT'S COMING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPRESSED ALL OVER THE WORLD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS SUCH A GRAVE AFFAIR
HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN LEAVING IT BUT EVEN IF THERE WERE NO OBSTACLES TO HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION HE WOULD DO NOTHING AT PRESENT HE HASN'T ENOUGH MORAL ENERGY TO TAKE A RESOLUTION OF ANY SORT PERMIT ME ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT IF I HAD DETAINED HIM
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GAVE HIM AN UNSMILING GLANCE TILL THEY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MAN'S ROOM TOODLES PRESERVED A SCANDALISED AND SOLEMN SILENCE
SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I NEVER HOPED TO SEE YOU HERE TO NIGHT ANNIE TOLD ME YES I HAD NO IDEA MYSELF THAT MY WORK WOULD BE OVER SO SOON
HE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HURRIEDLY AND FOUND MISTER VLADIMIR STILL IN THE HALL WRAPPING UP HIS THROAT CAREFULLY IN A LARGE SILK HANDKERCHIEF BEHIND HIM A FOOTMAN WAITED HOLDING HIS OVERCOAT ANOTHER STOOD READY TO OPEN THE DOOR
HE SAW NONE A COUPLE OF CARRIAGES WAITED BY THE CURBSTONE THEIR LAMPS BLAZING STEADILY THE HORSES STANDING PERFECTLY STILL AS IF CARVED IN STONE
BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS ALMOST AWED BY THE MIRACULOUS CLEVERNESS OF THE ENGLISH POLICE THE CHANGE OF HIS OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WAS SO VIOLENT THAT IT MADE HIM FOR A MOMENT FEEL SLIGHTLY SICK HE THREW AWAY HIS CIGAR AND MOVED ON
YOU SEE THAT WE ARE NOT SO BAD I WANTED PARTICULARLY TO TELL YOU OF OUR SUCCESS I'M SURE I'M VERY GRATEFUL MUTTERED MISTER VLADIMIR THROUGH HIS TEETH
THE GREAT MAN MANIFESTED NO SURPRISE NO EAGERNESS NO SENTIMENT WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE RESTED HIS MENACED EYES WAS PROFOUNDLY MEDITATIVE HE DID NOT ALTER IT THE LEAST BIT
AMENDED THE LADY FORCE OF HABIT PERHAPS SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER MOVED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE INSPIRATION HE HAS BEEN THREATENING SOCIETY WITH ALL SORTS OF HORRORS CONTINUED THE LADY
THE PROSECUTION OF THIS VERLOC WILL DEMONSTRATE TO THE PUBLIC BOTH THE DANGER AND THE INDECENCY NOBODY WILL BELIEVE WHAT A MAN OF THAT SORT SAYS SAID MISTER VLADIMIR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A QUIVER STIRRING THE WHITE THONGS OF THEIR BIG WHIPS MISTER VLADIMIR WALKED ON AND THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN FELL INTO STEP AT HIS ELBOW HE SAID NOTHING
WITH AN EXTREMELY READY SYMPATHY WHICH IN NICE YOUNGSTERS GOES OFTEN WITH A JOYOUS TEMPERAMENT HE FELT SORRY FOR THE GREAT PRESENCE HE CALLED THE CHIEF AND ALSO FOR THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
OF THE BIG HEAD LEANING ON THE BIG HAND ACCOMPANIED AN INTERMITTENT STIFLED BUT POWERFUL SOUND THE GREAT MAN HAD LAUGHED WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ANSWERED VERY READILY
AND A SCATTERED HANDFUL OF QUILL PENS THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE ON THE LARGE FLAT SURFACE EXCEPT A LITTLE BRONZE STATUETTE DRAPED IN A TOGA MYSTERIOUSLY WATCHFUL IN ITS SHADOWY IMMOBILITY
SOME STALWART CONSTABLES WHO DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE DUTY OF WATCHING THE AUGUST SPOT SALUTED HIM PENETRATING THROUGH A PORTAL BY NO MEANS LOFTY INTO THE PRECINCTS OF THE HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE
AND THE CONVERSATION DROPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MISTER VLADIMIR TOOK LEAVE DIRECTLY HIS BACK WAS TURNED ON THE COUCH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROSE TOO
THOUGH INDEED THE LAD HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIM TEMPORARILY IN THE COUNTRY UP TO EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT MICHAELIS KNOWS NOTHING OF IT TO THIS MOMENT YOU ARE POSITIVE AS TO THAT ASKED THE GREAT MAN QUITE CERTAIN SIR ETHELRED
WHOM HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME TIME ABOUT MIDNIGHT HIS TURNING UP SO EARLY HE CONCLUDED TO BE THE SIGN THAT THINGS WHATEVER THEY WERE HAD GONE WRONG
IT MUST HAVE SEEMED MIRACULOUS TO HIM THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ALREADY BUT HE TOOK IT ALL IN THE STRIDE THE WONDERFULNESS OF IT NEVER CHECKED HIM FOR A MOMENT
HE'S BEEN FRIGHTENING ME DECLARED SUDDENLY THE LADY WHO SAT BY THE SIDE OF MISTER VLADIMIR
BUT THE POISON WAS SCARCELY WORKING YET AROUND IT WAS A PATCH OF SILENT COMMON
CAUSED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT A SHOUTING AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DAILY ROUTINE OF WORKING EATING DRINKING SLEEPING WENT ON AS IT HAD DONE FOR COUNTLESS YEARS
A CURIOUS CROWD LINGERED RESTLESSLY PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BUT THE CROWD REMAINING
I HAD SLEPT BUT LITTLE THOUGH MY WIFE HAD SUCCEEDED IN SLEEPING AND I ROSE EARLY
ALL OVER THE DISTRICT PEOPLE WERE DINING AND SUPPING WORKING MEN WERE GARDENING AFTER THE LABOURS OF THE DAY
THEN I FETCHED OUT THE SERVANT TELLING HER I WOULD GO UPSTAIRS MYSELF FOR THE BOX SHE WAS CLAMOURING FOR WE CAN'T POSSIBLY STAY HERE I SAID AND AS I SPOKE THE FIRING REOPENED FOR A MOMENT UPON THE COMMON
AND HERE AND THERE A MESSENGER
A SUDDEN WHIRL OF BLACK SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE ROAD HID HIM FOR A MOMENT I RAN TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S DOOR AND RAPPED TO SATISFY MYSELF OF WHAT I ALREADY KNEW THAT HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO LONDON WITH HIM
AS THOUGH NO PLANET MARS EXISTED IN THE SKY EVEN AT WOKING STATION AND HORSELL AND CHOBHAM THAT WAS THE CASE IN WOKING JUNCTION UNTIL A LATE HOUR TRAINS WERE STOPPING AND GOING ON
TWO MAXIMS AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEN OF THE CARDIGAN REGIMENT STARTED FROM ALDERSHOT A FEW SECONDS AFTER MIDNIGHT
THREE GALLOPED THROUGH THE OPEN GATES OF THE ORIENTAL COLLEGE TWO OTHERS DISMOUNTED AND BEGAN RUNNING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THAT CAME A VIOLENT RATTLING CRASH QUITE CLOSE TO US THAT SHOOK THE GROUND AND STARTING OUT UPON THE LAWN I SAW THE TOPS OF THE TREES ABOUT THE ORIENTAL COLLEGE BURST INTO SMOKY RED FLAME
THE FEVER OF WAR THAT WOULD PRESENTLY CLOG VEIN AND ARTERY DEADEN NERVE AND DESTROY BRAIN HAD STILL TO DEVELOP ALL NIGHT LONG THE MARTIANS WERE HAMMERING AND STIRRING SLEEPLESS INDEFATIGABLE
SHOT WITH THREADS OF RED FIRE WERE DRIVING UP INTO THE STILL AIR AND THROWING DARK SHADOWS UPON THE GREEN TREETOPS EASTWARD THE SMOKE ALREADY EXTENDED FAR AWAY TO THE EAST AND WEST TO THE BYFLEET PINE WOODS EASTWARD
OF ALL THE STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED UPON THAT FRIDAY WAS THE DOVETAILING OF THE COMMONPLACE HABITS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER WITH THE FIRST BEGINNINGS OF THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WAS TO TOPPLE THAT SOCIAL ORDER HEADLONG
I TOOK CARE TO HAVE THE CART THERE AND THEN DROVE IT OFF DOWN THE ROAD AND LEAVING IT IN CHARGE OF MY WIFE AND SERVANT RUSHED INTO MY HOUSE AND PACKED A FEW VALUABLES SUCH PLATE AS WE HAD AND SO FORTH
THE WOODS HE SAID WERE STILL BURNING AND POINTED OUT A HAZE OF SMOKE TO ME THEY WILL BE HOT UNDER FOOT FOR DAYS ON ACCOUNT OF THE THICK SOIL OF PINE NEEDLES AND TURF HE SAID AND THEN GREW SERIOUS OVER
AND THEN STROLLED IN TO BREAKFAST IT WAS A MOST UNEXCEPTIONAL MORNING
I WENT IN AGAIN ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE TO GET MY SERVANT'S BOX LUGGED IT OUT
SWEPT THE COMMON AND THE HEAT RAY WAS READY TO FOLLOW SAVE FOR SUCH THAT BIG AREA OF COMMON WAS SILENT AND DESOLATE AND THE CHARRED BODIES LAY ABOUT ON IT ALL NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND ALL THE NEXT DAY A
POOR OGILVY AFTER BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF WORKING I DECIDED TO WALK DOWN TOWARDS THE COMMON
ONE OR TWO ADVENTUROUS SOULS IT WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND WENT INTO THE DARKNESS AND CRAWLED QUITE NEAR THE MARTIANS BUT THEY NEVER RETURNED FOR NOW AND AGAIN A LIGHT RAY
AND IN ORDER TO REFRESH MYSELF I TOOK A COLD BATH IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR I WENT UP TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AN EVENING PAPER FOR THE MORNING PAPERS HAD CONTAINED ONLY A VERY INACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE KILLING OF STENT
BLOW YER TRENCHES YOU ALWAYS WANT TRENCHES
OR TO DESTROY THE MARTIANS DURING THE DAY IT'S A PITY THEY MAKE THEMSELVES SO UNAPPROACHABLE HE SAID IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THEY LIVE ON ANOTHER PLANET
AND THE TOWER OF THE LITTLE CHURCH BESIDE IT SLIDE DOWN INTO RUIN THE PINNACLE OF THE MOSQUE HAD VANISHED AND THE ROOF LINE OF THE COLLEGE ITSELF
HE CAME UP TO THE FENCE AND EXTENDED A HANDFUL OF STRAWBERRIES FOR HIS GARDENING WAS AS GENEROUS AS IT WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AT THE SAME TIME HE TOLD ME OF THE BURNING OF THE PINE WOODS ABOUT THE BYFLEET GOLF LINKS
IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ONE HUMAN BEING OUTSIDE IT UNLESS IT WERE SOME RELATION OF STENT
THEY SAY SAID HE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE BLESSED THINGS FALLEN THERE NUMBER TWO BUT ONE'S ENOUGH SURELY THIS LOT'LL COST THE INSURANCE PEOPLE A PRETTY PENNY BEFORE EVERYTHING'S SETTLED
BEEN BORN A RABBIT SNIPPY AIN'T THEY GOT ANY NECKS THEN SAID A THIRD ABRUPTLY A LITTLE CONTEMPLATIVE DARK MAN SMOKING A PIPE I REPEATED MY DESCRIPTION OCTOPUSES SAID HE THAT'S WHAT I CALLS EM
THE BEECH TREES BELOW THE HOUSE WERE BURNING WHILE I DID THIS AND THE PALINGS UP THE ROAD GLOWED RED WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE DISMOUNTED HUSSARS CAME RUNNING UP HE WAS GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WARNING PEOPLE TO LEAVE
DIRTY RED JACKETS UNBUTTONED
I MUST HAVE A POUND SAID THE LANDLORD AND I'VE NO ONE TO DRIVE IT
HAD IMMEDIATELY TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE HORSE WHEN I LOOKED BACK AGAIN THE SECOND HILL HAD HIDDEN THE BLACK SMOKE I SLASHED THE HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GAVE HIM A LOOSE REIN UNTIL WOKING AND SEND LAY BETWEEN US AND THAT QUIVERING TUMULT
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THERE BEGAN THE THUD OF A GUN AT MEASURED INTERVALS FROM CHERTSEY OR ADDLESTONE I LEARNED THAT THE SMOULDERING PINE WOOD INTO WHICH THE SECOND CYLINDER HAD FALLEN WAS BEING SHELLED
SO THEY DISCUSSED IT AFTER A WHILE I LEFT THEM AND WENT ON TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AS MANY MORNING PAPERS AS I COULD BUT I WILL NOT WEARY THE READER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THAT LONG MORNING AND OF THE LONGER AFTERNOON
THE RINGING IMPACT OF TRUCKS THE SHARP WHISTLE OF THE ENGINES FROM THE JUNCTION MINGLED WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF MEN FROM MARS EXCITED MEN CAME INTO THE STATION ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK WITH INCREDIBLE TIDINGS
MANY PEOPLE HAD HEARD OF THE CYLINDER OF COURSE AND TALKED ABOUT IT IN THEIR LEISURE BUT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT MAKE THE SENSATION THAT AN ULTIMATUM TO GERMANY WOULD HAVE DONE IN LONDON THAT NIGHT POOR HENDERSON'S TELEGRAM
SOMETHING OF MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS OF BATTLE AND HEROISM CAME BACK
HOW ARE WE TO GET TO LEATHERHEAD SHE SAID
AND TO WOKING ON THE WEST THE ROAD WAS DOTTED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING TOWARDS US AND VERY FAINT NOW BUT VERY DISTINCT THROUGH THE HOT QUIET AIR ONE HEARD THE WHIRR OF A MACHINE GUN
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES WERE CERTAINLY ALIVE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE BUSINESS
ABOUT ELEVEN A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS CAME THROUGH HORSELL
SAID MY WIFE IN TERROR I THOUGHT PERPLEXED THEN I REMEMBERED HER COUSINS AT LEATHERHEAD LEATHERHEAD I SHOUTED ABOVE THE SUDDEN NOISE SHE LOOKED AWAY FROM ME DOWNHILL THE PEOPLE WERE COMING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ASTONISHED
HENDERSON OGILVY AND THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS LITTLE I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE HOWEVER
IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE WERE CLEAR OF THE SMOKE AND NOISE AND SPANKING DOWN THE OPPOSITE SLOPE OF MAYBURY HILL TOWARDS OLD WOKING
NOW THAT THE COLLEGE WAS CLEARED OUT OF THE WAY AT THAT
I SHOUTED AFTER HIM WHAT NEWS HE TURNED STARED BAWLED SOMETHING ABOUT CRAWLING OUT IN A THING LIKE A DISH COVER
AND AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS STREAMER OF SMOKE
HAD BEEN ON THE COMMON EARLIER IN THE DAY
A RED GLOW AND A THIN VEIL OF SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE STARS AND THOUGHT THAT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A HEATH FIRE WAS HAPPENING IT WAS ONLY ROUND THE EDGE OF THE COMMON THAT ANY DISTURBANCE WAS PERCEPTIBLE
FRESH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SIGNAL BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS WAS THE STEREOTYPED FORMULA OF THE PAPERS A SAPPER TOLD ME IT WAS DONE BY A MAN IN A DITCH WITH A FLAG ON A LONG POLE THE MARTIANS TOOK AS MUCH NOTICE OF SUCH ADVANCES
BEYOND WAS A FRINGE OF EXCITEMENT AND FARTHER THAN THAT FRINGE THE INFLAMMATION HAD NOT CREPT AS YET IN THE REST OF THE WORLD THE STREAM OF LIFE
OTHERS WERE SHUNTING ON THE SIDINGS PASSENGERS WERE ALIGHTING AND WAITING AND EVERYTHING WAS PROCEEDING IN THE MOST ORDINARY WAY A BOY FROM THE TOWN TRENCHING ON SMITH'S MONOPOLY WAS SELLING PAPERS WITH THE AFTERNOON'S NEWS
HE TOLD ME THAT DURING THE NIGHT THE MARTIANS HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY TROOPS AND THAT GUNS WERE EXPECTED THEN A FAMILIAR REASSURING NOTE I HEARD A TRAIN RUNNING TOWARDS WOKING
ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING AS I SAT AT TEA WITH MY WIFE IN THE SUMMERHOUSE TALKING VIGOROUSLY ABOUT THE BATTLE THAT WAS LOWERING UPON US I HEARD A MUFFLED DETONATION FROM THE COMMON AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER A GUST OF FIRING
TALK ABOUT FISHERS OF MEN FIGHTERS OF FISH IT IS THIS TIME IT AIN'T NO MURDER KILLING BEASTS LIKE THAT SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
THEIR IDEA WAS THAT A DISPUTE HAD ARISEN AT THE HORSE GUARDS THE ORDINARY SAPPER IS A GREAT DEAL BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE COMMON SOLDIER AND THEY DISCUSSED THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF THE POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH SOME ACUTENESS
IF ON FRIDAY NIGHT YOU HAD TAKEN A PAIR OF COMPASSES
AND HIS EVENING PAPER AFTER WIRING FOR AUTHENTICATION FROM HIM AND RECEIVING NO REPLY
BUT TOWARDS THE COMMON THERE WAS NOTHING STIRRING BUT A LARK THE MILKMAN CAME AS USUAL I HEARD THE RATTLE OF HIS CHARIOT
AT WORK UPON THE MACHINES THEY WERE MAKING READY AND EVER AND AGAIN A PUFF OF GREENISH WHITE SMOKE
THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD
AND CAUSED NO MORE DISTURBANCE THAN DRUNKARDS MIGHT HAVE DONE PEOPLE RATTLING LONDONWARDS PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS AND SAW ONLY A RARE FLICKERING VANISHING SPARK DANCE UP FROM THE DIRECTION OF HORSELL
I SAW ONE OF THE CARDIGAN MEN STANDING SENTINEL THERE I TALKED WITH THESE SOLDIERS FOR A TIME I TOLD THEM OF MY SIGHT OF THE MARTIANS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING NONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THE MARTIANS
THAT HIS SON WAS AMONG THE DEAD ON THE COMMON THE SOLDIERS HAD MADE THE PEOPLE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HORSELL LOCK UP AND LEAVE THEIR HOUSES I GOT BACK TO LUNCH ABOUT TWO VERY TIRED FOR AS I HAVE SAID THE DAY WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND DULL
NOISE OF HAMMERING FROM THE PIT WAS HEARD BY MANY PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE THE STATE OF THINGS ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE CENTRE STICKING INTO THE SKIN OF OUR OLD PLANET EARTH LIKE A POISONED DART WAS THIS CYLINDER
THE FIGHTING BEGINS SATURDAY LIVES IN MY MEMORY AS A DAY OF SUSPENSE IT WAS A DAY OF LASSITUDE TOO HOT AND CLOSE WITH I AM TOLD A RAPIDLY FLUCTUATING BAROMETER
I RAN FOR I PERCEIVED THAT IN A MOMENT EVERYONE UPON THIS SIDE OF THE HILL WOULD BE MOVING I FOUND HIM IN HIS BAR QUITE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIS HOUSE A MAN STOOD
AS WE SHOULD OF THE LOWING OF A COW I MUST CONFESS THE SIGHT OF ALL THIS ARMAMENT ALL THIS PREPARATION GREATLY EXCITED ME MY IMAGINATION BECAME BELLIGERENT AND DEFEATED THE INVADERS IN A DOZEN STRIKING WAYS
STUDENTS SAT OVER THEIR BOOKS MAYBE THERE WAS A MURMUR IN THE VILLAGE STREETS
LORD SAID THE LANDLORD WHAT'S THE HURRY I'M SELLING MY BIT OF A PIG
AND WHATEVER CLAIMS THEY BOAST HIS RIVALS KNOW IT HIS TERMS ARE MODERATE SO MUCH CASH DOWN WHEN THE GOODS ARE DELIVERED SO MUCH IN BLACKMAIL AFTERWARDS HE CONSULTS YOUR CONVENIENCE
AND THIS THAT ABSTEMIOUS MAN UNFOLDED TO TONKER OVER A CUP OF TEA HAD TONKER NOT BEEN NEARLY INSANE WITH PRIDE OVER THEIR RECENT TRANSACTION AND HAD HE NOT BEEN BLINDED BY A VENERATION FOR NUTH HE WOULD HAVE
TO OPEN DOORS AND LASTLY TO CLIMB LET IT SUFFICE THAT THE BUSINESS PROSPERED GREATLY WHILE GLOWING REPORTS OF TOMMY TONKER'S PROGRESS WERE SENT FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED
BEGAN TO MIX WITH HIS BLOOD HIS HOOVES THUNDERED HE CAME TO THE CITIES OF MEN AND ALL MEN TREMBLED FOR THEY REMEMBERED THE ANCIENT MYTHICAL WARS AND NOW THEY DREADED NEW BATTLES AND FEARED FOR THE RACE OF MAN
HIS SKILL MAY BE COUNTED UPON I HAVE SEEN A SHADOW ON A WINDY NIGHT MOVE MORE NOISILY THAN NUTH FOR NUTH IS A BURGLAR BY TRADE MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO STAY IN COUNTRY HOUSES
THEY GO TO GLITTER IN LIGHT THAT HAS NOT YET COME TO THE WORLD AND AS THE DAWN WORKS UP FROM THE RAGGED HILLS AND THE STARS FEEL IT THEY GO SLANTING EARTHWARDS TILL SUNLIGHT TOUCHES THE TOPS OF THE TALLEST TREES AND THE HIPPOGRIFFS ALIGHT
SHE WAS MORE MYSTICAL THAN WOMAN HER BEAUTY WAS AS A DREAM WAS AS A SONG THE ONE DREAM OF A LIFETIME DREAMED ON ENCHANTED DEWS
AND ONLY SEEING DIMLY THROUGH HIS LASHES SEIZED SOMBELENE BY THE HAIR
NO TRACK LED UP TO THE SINISTER GLOOM OF THE TREES EITHER OF MEN OR CATTLE NOT EVEN A POACHER HAD BEEN THERE SNARING ELVES FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS YOU DID NOT TRESPASS TWICE IN THE DELLS OF THE GNOLES
NEVER KNEW THAT IT WAS HE THAT SHOULD COME TO THE ULTIMATE CITY NEVER KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SEE THE UNDER PITS
THE RIDER TURNED SLOWLY EARTHWARD HE KNEW NOW WHY ALL THE WINDOWS FACED THIS WAY THE DENIZENS OF THE TWILIGHT GAZED AT THE WORLD AND NOT AT A GREATER THAN THEM THEN FROM THE LAST STEP OF THE EARTHWARD STAIRWAY
BUT I CRY OVER SPILT MILK HE EXPOSTULATED RESPECTFULLY HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER NOT GO HE SAID IT WAS NOT FAIR HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO ARGUE
AT EVENING UPON THE WORLD WHILE OTHERS HINT THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THESE MIGHT UNDO OUR CIVILIZATION THERE WATCHED HIM CEASELESSLY FROM THE UNDER PITS THOSE EYES WHOSE DUTY IT IS FROM FURTHER WITHIN AND DEEPER
WOULD FAIL TO APPRECIATE THE GRADUAL DEGREES BY WHICH TOMMY TONKER CAME FIRST TO CROSS BARE BOARDS COVERED WITH LITTLE OBSTACLES IN THE DARK WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND AND THEN TO GO SILENTLY UP CREAKY STAIRS AND THEN
THE LIONS CAME NOT TO WOO HER BECAUSE THEY FEARED HER STRENGTH AND THE GODS DARED NOT LOVE HER BECAUSE THEY KNEW SHE MUST DIE THIS WAS WHAT EVENING HAD WHISPERED TO THE BAT
AND IN THE END ONE WINDY OCTOBER MORNING WITH A MENACE IN THE AIR FOUND HIM AND NUTH DRAWING NEAR TO THE DREADFUL WOOD NUTH BY WEIGHING LITTLE EMERALDS AGAINST PIECES OF COMMON ROCK HAD ASCERTAINED THE PROBABLE WEIGHT OF THOSE HOUSE ORNAMENTS
BECAUSE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF FABULOUS THINGS SHE DWELT SAID EVENING SECRETLY TO THE BAT IN A LITTLE TEMPLE BY A LONE LAKESHORE A GROVE OF CYPRESSES SCREENED HER FROM THE CITY FROM ZRETAZOOLA OF THE CLIMBING WAYS
HERE IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS ON ONE SPRING MORNING CAME AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED ASKING FOR MISTER NUTH AND WITH HER CAME HER LARGE AND AWKWARD SON MISSUS EGGINS THE CARETAKER
AND TO MAKE HIM HIS APPRENTICE AND THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE BONNET WAS LINED WITH RED WENT BACK TO HER LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY AND EVERY EVENING SAID TO HER OLD MAN TONKER WE MUST FASTEN THE SHUTTERS OF A NIGHT TIME FOR TOMMY'S A BURGLAR NOW
THESE MOULDERING CHAIRS THESE FULL LENGTH ANCESTORS AND CARVED MAHOGANY ARE THE PRODUCE OF THE INCOMPARABLE NUTH IT MAY BE URGED AGAINST MY USE OF THE WORD INCOMPARABLE THAT IN THE BURGLARY BUSINESS THE NAME OF SLITH
WALL ABOVE WALL AND MOUNTAIN ABOVE MOUNTAIN STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD AND IN PERPETUAL TWILIGHT ALONE WITH THE MOON AND THE SUN HOLDS UP THE INCONCEIVABLE CITY OF NEVER TO TREAD ITS STREETS HE WAS DESTINED
FOR THE TRICK OF THE HOLES IN THE TREES WAS NEW TO HIM THEN HE STOLE NIMBLY AWAY THROUGH THE DREADFUL WOOD AND DID THEY CATCH NUTH YOU ASK ME GENTLE READER
GOING BACK TO SOME AIRY DANCING PLACE OF HIS PEOPLE AND HE THAT SURMOUNTED GLITTERING TOLDENARBA AND CAME ALONE OF MEN TO THE CITY OF NEVER HAS HIS NAME AND HIS FAME AMONG NATIONS
PROPHECY KNEW IT HE HAD THE MAGIC HALTER AND A WORN OLD ROPE IT WAS AN OLD WAYFARING WOMAN HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM IT HAD THE POWER TO HOLD ANY ANIMAL WHOSE RACE HAD NEVER KNOWN CAPTIVITY SUCH AS THE UNICORN
THE HIPPOGRIFF SHIED FRANTICALLY AND NEITHER THE MAGIC HALTER NOR ANYTHING THAT HE DID COULD MAKE THE MONSTER FACE IT AT LAST FROM THE CITY OF NEVER'S LONELY OUTSKIRTS WHERE NO INHABITANTS WALKED
HIS GOAL WAS ZRETAZOOLA THE CITY OF SOMBELENE WHAT LEGEND OF SOMBELENE'S INHUMAN BEAUTY OR OF THE WONDER OF HER MYSTERY HAD EVER FLOATED OVER THE MUNDANE PLAIN
AND DAWN CAME ON LIKE MUSIC LIKE A NEW SONG DUCKS SHOT BY TO THE LAKE FROM STILL DARK FIELDS OF CORN FAR VOICES UTTERED A COLOUR GREW UPON WATER AND STILL THE HIPPOGRIFFS GLORIED IN THE LIGHT
THE ORB WAS GREY BUT IT GLITTERED LIGHTS BLINKED SURPRISINGLY IN EARLY WINDOWS FORTH OVER WET DIM FIELDS WENT COWS FROM THEIR HOUSES EVEN IN THIS HOUR TOUCHED THE FIELDS AGAIN THE FEET OF THE HIPPOGRIFF
HE GALLOPED ON INTO THEIR GOLDEN MIST AND WHEN IT HID FROM HIS EYES THE SIGHT OF THINGS THE DREAMS IN HIS HEART AWOKE AND ROMANTICALLY HE PONDERED ALL THOSE RUMOURS THAT USED TO COME TO HIM FROM SOMBELENE
STANDS PARAMOUNT AND ALONE AND OF THIS I AM NOT IGNORANT BUT SLITH IS A CLASSIC AND LIVED LONG AGO AND KNEW NOTHING AT ALL OF MODERN COMPETITION BESIDES WHICH
HE REVELLED THROUGH KINGDOMS TOOK RIVERS IN HIS STRIDE HOW SHALL I TELL YOU YE THAT DWELL IN CITIES
FIRST OF ALL NUTH WANTED TO SEE A BUSINESS REFERENCE AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN ONE FROM A JEWELLER WITH WHOM HE HAPPENED TO BE HAND IN GLOVE THE UPSHOT OF IT WAS THAT HE AGREED TO TAKE YOUNG TONKER FOR THIS WAS THE SURNAME OF THE LIKELY LAD
BEFORE DAWN HE ROSE TRIUMPHANT AND HUGELY DRANK OF SOME RIVER IN THE DARK AND SPLASHING OUT OF IT
INSTRUCTED BY MISTER NUTH WHO WAITED OUTSIDE CAME AWAY WITH ONE POCKETFUL OF RINGS AND SHIRT STUDS IT WAS QUITE A LIGHT POCKETFUL BUT THE JEWELLERS IN PARIS COULD NOT MATCH IT WITHOUT SENDING SPECIALLY TO AFRICA
THE AGED MADE SUBTLE PROPHECIES IS HE NOT SWIFT SAID THE YOUNG HOW GLAD HE IS SAID CHILDREN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT BROUGHT HIM SLEEP AND DAY AFTER DAY LIT HIS GALLOP
AND THE WIND OF THE AUTUMN THAT WAS GILDING THE WORLD RUSHING UP THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN BEAT COLD ON HIS NAKED FLANKS HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SNORTED I AM A MAN HORSE NOW HE SHOUTED ALOUD
WITH COBBLED AGATES WERE ITS STREETS A GLORY THROUGH SMALL SQUARE PANES OF ROSE QUARTZ THE CITIZENS LOOKED FROM THEIR HOUSES TO THEM AS THEY LOOKED ABROAD THE WORLD FAR OFF SEEMED HAPPY
FOR ONLY HER BEAUTY AND HER LINEAGE WERE DIVINE HER FATHER HAD BEEN HALF CENTAUR AND HALF GOD HER MOTHER WAS THE CHILD OF A DESERT LION AND THAT SPHINX THAT WATCHES THE PYRAMIDS
HOW ONE CAME AS WAS FORETOLD TO THE CITY OF NEVER THE CHILD THAT PLAYED ABOUT THE TERRACES AND GARDENS IN SIGHT OF THE SURREY HILLS
HOW NUTH WOULD HAVE PRACTISED HIS ART UPON THE GNOLES DESPITE THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF RIVAL FIRMS IT IS PROBABLE THAT EVERY TRADESMAN KNOWS THAT NOBODY IN BUSINESS AT THE PRESENT TIME
WHEN THERE APPEARED FAR UP IN THE DEEPS OF THE NIGHT TWO LITTLE SAFFRON SPECKS THEN FOUR AND FIVE IT WAS THE HIPPOGRIFFS DANCING AND TWIRLING AROUND IN THE SUN ANOTHER FLOCK JOINED THEM THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM NOW
COMING OUT FROM THE CAVERN THAT WAS HIS HOME WENT FOR THE FIRST TIME OVER THE LITTLE STREAM AND GOING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE CRAGS SAW GLITTERING BENEATH HIM THE MUNDANE PLAIN
THEY DESCENDED IN WIDE CURVES SLOWLY TREES DOWN ON EARTH REVEALED AGAINST THE SKY JET BLACK EACH DELICATE TWIG A STAR DISAPPEARED FROM A CLUSTER NOW ANOTHER
IT HAD BEEN PROPHECIED THAT HE SHOULD COME THERE THEY KNEW IT WHEN THE PEBBLES WERE BEING MADE AND BEFORE THE ISLES OF CORAL WERE GIVEN UNTO THE SEA AND THUS THE PROPHECY CAME UNTO FULFILMENT AND PASSED INTO HISTORY
ON THE CONTRARY SUCH POLITICS AS I HAVE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PROPERTY AND HE NEEDS NO WORDS FROM ME FOR HIS POSITION IS ALMOST UNIQUE IN TRADE
OTHER TEMPLES THEY HAVE WHO KNOWS TO WHAT DIVINITIES AND HE THAT WAS DESTINED ALONE OF MEN TO COME TO THE CITY OF NEVER WAS WELL CONTENT TO BEHOLD IT AS HE TROTTED DOWN ITS AGATE STREET
TO SING IN SOME CITY'S SPIRES BEFORE DAYLIGHT COMES HE WAS THE SWORN COMPANION OF THE WIND FOR JOY HE WAS AS A SONG THE LIGHTNINGS OF HIS LEGENDARY SIRES THE EARLIER GODS
THE WIND THAT SLEPT AT THE TIME LEAPED UP LIKE A DOG AT THEIR ONRUSH IT UTTERED A CRY AND RAN PAST THEM DOWN ON THE WORLD IT WAS MORNING NIGHT WAS ROAMING AWAY WITH HIS CLOAK TRAILED BEHIND HIM
AND THE UNEARTHLY SILENCE GAVE WAY AS IT WERE WITH A GRACE TO THE RAPID SCREAMS OF TONKER AS THEY PICKED HIM UP FROM BEHIND SCREAMS THAT CAME FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE INCOHERENT
NUTH WARNED YOUNG TONKER AGAINST GREED AND EXPLAINED THAT THE EMERALDS WERE WORTH LESS THAN CHEESE UNTIL THEY WERE SAFE AWAY FROM THE DREADFUL WOOD EVERYTHING HAD BEEN PLANNED AND THEY WALKED NOW IN SILENCE
THEY SAW THE SKELETON OF SOME EARLY GEORGIAN POACHER NAILED TO A DOOR IN AN OAK TREE SOMETIMES THEY SAW A FAIRY SCUTTLE AWAY FROM THEM ONCE TONKER STEPPED HEAVILY ON A HARD DRY STICK AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH LAY STILL FOR TWENTY MINUTES
AS A WOUNDED BEAST GOES HOME BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HEIGHTS THAT VENTUROUS RIDER SAW HUGE AND FAIR TO THE LEFT OF HIM THE DESTINED CITY OF NEVER AND HE BEHELD THE TOWERS OF LEL AND LEK
TONKER HAD ASKED FOR A PISTOL BUT NUTH REPLIED THAT THE SOUND OF A SHOT WOULD BRING EVERYTHING DOWN ON US AND NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT IT INTO THE WOOD THEY WENT ALL DAY DEEPER AND DEEPER
HISTORY DOES NOT KNOW THEM BUT WHAT OF THAT NOT ALL OF US HAVE SAT AT HISTORIANS FEET BUT ALL HAVE LEARNED FABLE AND MYTH AT THEIR MOTHERS KNEES
THAT MARVEL OF THE NATIONS NOT WHEN IT IS NIGHT IN THE WORLD AND WE CAN SEE NO FURTHER THAN THE STARS NOT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING WHERE WE DWELL DAZZLING OUR EYES BUT WHEN THE SUN HAS SET ON SOME STORMY DAYS
THE YOUTH REMAINED ON THE GROUND LIKE A PARCEL HE STARED WITH A VACANT LOOK INTO THE FIRE AFTER A TIME HE AROUSED FOR SOME PART AND THE THINGS ABOUT HIM BEGAN TO TAKE FORM HE SAW THAT THE GROUND IN THE DEEP SHADOWS WAS CLUTTERED WITH MEN
GOT CAREFULLY DOWN LIKE A CRONE STOOPING HE STRETCHED OUT WITH A MURMUR OF RELIEF AND COMFORT THE GROUND FELT LIKE THE SOFTEST COUCH
AND HE BEGAN TO REPENT OF HAVING SPENT HIS GOLD PIECES ON ADVICE THAT SEEMED WORTHLESS HOWEVER ON HIS WAY HE TURNED INTO A BAZAR TO BUY SOME FOOD
OF A SUDDEN HE CONFRONTED A BLACK AND MONSTROUS FIGURE A RIFLE BARREL CAUGHT SOME GLINTING BEAMS HALT HALT HE WAS DISMAYED FOR A MOMENT BUT HE PRESENTLY THOUGHT THAT HE
RECOGNIZED THE NERVOUS VOICE AS HE STOOD TOTTERING BEFORE THE RIFLE BARREL HE CALLED OUT
I'VE GOT YOUR THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER SNARLED
WITHIN THE GLEAM OF ROSE AND ORANGE LIGHT FROM THE BURNING STICKS WERE OTHER SOLDIERS SNORING AND HEAVING OR LYING DEATHLIKE IN SLUMBER A FEW PAIRS OF LEGS WERE STUCK FORTH RIGID AND STRAIGHT
THE FIRE CACKLED MUSICALLY FROM IT SWELLED LIGHT SMOKE OVERHEAD THE FOLIAGE MOVED SOFTLY THE LEAVES WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARD THE BLAZE WERE COLORED SHIFTING HUES OF SILVER
AND IT IS THIS YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA RESTRAIN YOUR ANGER IF ANYTHING YOU SEE OR HEAR MAKES YOU ANGRY STILL DO NOT AT ONCE TAKE ACTION
AND THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE MAXIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT ACT CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL OPINION SO HE YIELDED AND DRAGGED AWAY THE BODY AND THREW IT INTO A RAVINE
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER CAME SWINGING TWO CANTEENS BY THEIR LIGHT STRINGS WELL NOW HENRY OL BOY SAID THE LATTER WE'LL HAVE YEH FIXED UP IN JEST ABOUT A MINNIT HE HAD THE BUSTLING WAYS OF AN AMATEUR NURSE
HOL ON A MINNIT CONTINUED THE YOUTH
THE RIFLE WAS LOWERED TO A POSITION OF CAUTION AND THE LOUD SOLDIER CAME SLOWLY FORWARD HE PEERED INTO THE YOUTH'S FACE THAT YOU HENRY YES IT'S IT'S ME
HE SUBMITTED PASSIVELY TO THE LATTER'S DIRECTING STRENGTH HIS HEAD WAS IN THE OLD MANNER HANGING FORWARD UPON HIS BREAST HIS KNEES WOBBLED
NOW HENRY HE SAID LET'S HAVE LOOK AT YER OL HEAD
HE SPREAD THE RUBBER ONE UPON THE GROUND AND PLACED THE WOOLEN ONE ABOUT THE YOUTH'S SHOULDERS THERE NOW HE SAID LIE DOWN AN GIT SOME SLEEP THE YOUTH WITH HIS MANNER OF DOGLIKE OBEDIENCE
YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA WHENEVER YOU GO TO VISIT A FRIEND OR ONE OF YOUR SUBJECTS AND THEY OFFER YOU A BEDSTEAD OR STOOL OR MAT TO SIT ON DO NOT SIT DOWN AT ONCE BUT MOVE THE STOOL OR MAT
THEREUPON HE APPLAUDED THE WISDOM OF HIS TEACHER FOR IF HE HAD BATHED AT THE COMMON BATHING PLACE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE PURSE AND HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE TURNED INTO A VILLAGE AND ASKED THE HEADMAN
HIS HEAD FELL FORWARD ON HIS CROOKED ARM AND HIS WEIGHTED LIDS WENT SOFTLY DOWN OVER HIS EYES HEARING A SPLATTER OF MUSKETRY FROM THE DISTANCE HE WONDERED INDIFFERENTLY IF THOSE MEN SOMETIMES SLEPT
HOL ON A MINNIT WHERE YOU GOIN T SLEEP HIS FRIEND WAVED HIS HAND IMPATIENTLY
I KNOW I'M A BLACKSMITH AT TAKIN KEER A SICK FOLKS AN YEH NEVER SQUEAKED
AND THE RARE WOUND AH HERE WE ARE HE SAID HE AWKWARDLY MADE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS JEST AS I THOUGHT HE ADDED PRESENTLY YEH'VE BEEN GRAZED BY A BALL
THESE FACES EXPRESSED IN THEIR LINES THE DEEP STUPOR OF THE TIRED SOLDIERS THEY MADE THEM APPEAR LIKE MEN DRUNK WITH WINE THIS BIT OF FOREST MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO AN ETHEREAL WANDERER
HE HAD A CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD SOON FEEL IN HIS SORE HEART THE BARBED MISSILES OF RIDICULE HE HAD NO STRENGTH TO INVENT A TALE HE WOULD BE A SOFT TARGET HE MADE VAGUE PLANS TO GO OFF INTO THE DEEPER DARKNESS AND HIDE
OFTEN EDGED WITH RED FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE FOREST COULD BE SEEN A HANDFUL OF STARS LYING LIKE GLITTERING PEBBLES ON THE BLACK LEVEL OF THE NIGHT
AND HE TOOK WITH HIM A PURSE OF MONEY AND THREE PIECES OF GOLD AFTER TRAVELLING A LONG TIME HE ONE DAY SAW A MAN PLOUGHING IN A FIELD AND HE WENT AND GOT SOME TOBACCO FROM HIM
WHY HELLO HENRY YOU HERE WHY I THOUGHT YOU WAS DEAD FOUR HOURS AGO GREAT JERUSALEM THEY KEEP TURNIN UP EVERY TEN MINUTES OR SO WE THOUGHT WE'D LOST FORTY TWO MEN BY STRAIGHT COUNT
HE SAID SEVERELY AFTER THE REPROOF THE YOUTH SAID NO MORE AN EXQUISITE DROWSINESS HAD SPREAD THROUGH HIM THE WARM COMFORT OF THE BLANKET ENVELOPED HIM AND MADE A GENTLE LANGOUR
AN HE'S IN A FIX AN WE MUST SEE T HIM RIGHT AWAY HE RESTED HIS RIFLE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS LEFT ARM AND HIS RIGHT AROUND THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER GEE IT MUST HURT LIKE THUNDER HE SAID THE YOUTH LEANED HEAVILY UPON HIS FRIEND
MY THIRD MAXIM IS THIS YOU ARE THE SON OF A RAJA WHEN MEN COME TO YOU FOR ADVICE OR TO HAVE A DISPUTE DECIDED LISTEN TO WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PRESENT SAY
I GOT SEPARATED BEGAN THE YOUTH WITH CONSIDERABLE GLIBNESS
BUT THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED BY THE VOICES OF EXHAUSTION AND PAIN FROM HIS BODY HIS AILMENTS CLAMORING FORCED HIM TO SEEK THE PLACE OF FOOD AND REST AT WHATEVER COST HE SWUNG UNSTEADILY TOWARD THE FIRE
AS A SCENE OF THE RESULT OF SOME FRIGHTFUL DEBAUCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE THE YOUTH OBSERVED AN OFFICER ASLEEP SEATED BOLT UPRIGHT WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A TREE THERE WAS SOMETHING PERILOUS IN HIS POSITION
THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE BOUNDARY OF HIS OWN TERRITORY AND DECIDED TO PRESS ON HOME ALTHOUGH IT WAS DARK AT MIDNIGHT HE REACHED THE PALACE AND WITHOUT AROUSING ANYONE WENT TO THE DOOR OF HIS WIFE'S ROOM
THE YOUTH MADE NO REPLY BUT BEGAN TO FUMBLE WITH THE BUTTONS OF HIS JACKET WELL COME NOW CONTINUED HIS FRIEND
NOW PAY ME AND THE PRINCE GAVE HIM HIS LAST GOLD COIN AND SAID THAT HE HAD NO MORE WELL SAID THE PLOUGHMAN YOUR LESSON IS FINISHED BUT STILL I WILL GIVE YOU ONE MORE PIECE OF ADVICE FREE
WHO YEH TALKIN TO WILSON HE DEMANDED HIS VOICE WAS ANGER TONED WHO YEH TALKIN TO
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO DO SO WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE MAXIM OF HIS INSTRUCTOR AND PULLED THE RUG TO ONE SIDE AND WHEN HE DID SO HE SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER THE MOUTH OF A WELL AND THAT IF HE HAD SAT ON IT
BADGERED BY DREAMS PERHAPS HE SWAYED WITH LITTLE BOUNCES AND STARTS LIKE AN OLD TODDY STRICKEN GRANDFATHER IN A CHIMNEY CORNER DUST AND STAINS WERE UPON HIS FACE
MOVING OFF AND SURVEYING HIS DEED
THE SHOES DISPLAYED THE MUD OR DUST OF MARCHES AND BITS OF ROUNDED TROUSERS PROTRUDING FROM THE BLANKETS SHOWED RENTS AND TEARS FROM HURRIED PITCHINGS THROUGH THE DENSE BRAMBLES
THEN HAVING EATEN HIS LUNCH HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS PURSE BEHIND
YEH'LL FELL THAT A NUMBER TEN HAT WOULDN'T FIT YEH AN YOUR HEAD'LL BE ALL HET UP AN FEEL AS DRY AS BURNT PORK
THESE TWO HAD SLUMBERED IN AN EMBRACE BUT THE WEAPON HAD BEEN ALLOWED IN TIME TO FALL UNHEEDED TO THE GROUND THE BRASS MOUNTED HILT LAY IN CONTACT WITH SOME PARTS OF THE FIRE
MAYBE IT'S A PRETTY BAD UN WHEN I GIT RELIEVED IN A COUPLE A MINNITS
THE PRINCE WHO ACQUIRED WISDOM THERE WAS ONCE A RAJA WHO HAD AN ONLY SON AND THE RAJA WAS ALWAYS URGING HIS SON TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE IN ORDER THAT WHEN HE CAME TO HIS KINGDOM
OR PERHAPS HE WOULD LIFT HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSTURE BLINK AT THE FIRE FOR AN UNINTELLIGENT MOMENT THROW A SWIFT GLANCE AT HIS PROSTRATE COMPANION
TO LET HIM SLEEP IN HIS VERANDAH AND THERE WAS ALREADY ONE OTHER TRAVELLER SLEEPING THERE AND IN THE MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TRAVELLER HAD DIED IN HIS SLEEP THEN THE HEADMAN CONSULTED THE VILLAGERS AND THEY DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE
HE FUSSED AROUND THE FIRE AND STIRRED THE STICKS TO BRILLIANT EXERTIONS HE MADE HIS PATIENT DRINK LARGELY FROM THE CANTEEN THAT CONTAINED THE COFFEE IT WAS TO THE YOUTH A DELICIOUS DRAUGHT
SPRAWLING IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSTURE GLANCING NARROWLY INTO THE MORE DISTANT DARKNESS HE CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF VISAGES THAT LOOMED PALLID AND GHOSTLY LIT WITH A PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW
THEN HE WENT ON HIS WAY AND ON THE ROAD HE TURNED ASIDE TO A TANK TO BATHE AND REMEMBERING THE MAXIM OF HIS TEACHER HE DID NOT BATHE AT THE COMMON PLACE BUT WENT TO A PLACE APART
PUT IM T SLEEP IN MY BLANKET SIMPSON AN' HOL ON A MINNIT HERE'S MY CANTEEN IT'S FULL A COFFEE
AND HE RESOLVED TO GO AWAY TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO ACQUIRE WISDOM
OCCASIONALLY IN THIS LOW ARCHED HALL A SOLDIER WOULD AROUSE AND TURN HIS BODY TO A NEW POSITION THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS SLEEP HAVING TAUGHT HIM OF UNEVEN AND OBJECTIONABLE PLACES UPON THE GROUND UNDER HIM
BY GINGER I'M GLAD T SEE YEH I GIVE YEH UP FER A GONER I THOUGHT YEH WAS DEAD SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS HUSKY EMOTION IN HIS VOICE THE YOUTH FOUND THAT NOW HE COULD BARELY STAND UPON HIS FEET
SHE DREW BACK IN FEAR SHE TOLD HIM WHO SHE WAS AND EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD PUT THE SHOES AND SWORD AT THE DOOR TO PREVENT ANYONE ELSE FROM ENTERING BUT IN HIS WRATH THE PRINCE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND CALLED TO HER TO COME OUT AND BE KILLED
BUT TO THROW AWAY THE BODY AND THAT AS THE PRINCE WAS ALSO A TRAVELLER HE SHOULD DO IT AT FIRST HE REFUSED TO TOUCH THE CORPSE AS HE WAS THE SON OF A RAJA BUT THE VILLAGERS INSISTED
OUTSIDE THE DOOR HE SAW A PAIR OF SHOES AND A SWORD AT THE SIGHT HE BECAME WILD WITH RAGE AND DRAWING THE SWORD HE CALLED OUT WHO IS IN MY ROOM
BEFORE LEAVING IT HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS PROPER TO REMOVE THE CLOTHES AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO DO SO HE FOUND ROUND THE WAIST OF THE BODY A ROLL OF COIN SO HE TOOK THIS AND WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF HIS TEACHER
MAY GIT A LOT A OTHER SICKNESSES TOO BY MORNIN
HIS LOWER JAW HUNG DOWN AS IF LACKING STRENGTH TO ASSUME ITS NORMAL POSITION HE WAS THE PICTURE OF AN EXHAUSTED SOLDIER AFTER A FEAST OF WAR HE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO SLEEP WITH HIS SWORD IN HIS ARMS
THERE WAS A SUDDEN SINKING OF HIS FORCES HE THOUGHT HE MUST HASTEN TO PRODUCE HIS TALE TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE MISSILES ALREADY ON THE LIPS OF HIS REDOUBTABLE COMRADES SO STAGGERING BEFORE THE LOUD SOLDIER HE BEGAN
HE TILTED HIS HEAD AFAR BACK AND HELD THE CANTEEN LONG TO HIS LIPS THE COOL MIXTURE WENT CARESSINGLY DOWN HIS BLISTERED THROAT HAVING FINISHED HE SIGHED WITH COMFORTABLE DELIGHT
UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
HE ROSE WITH A FINE SURPRISE GONE HE SAID WITH A HALF LAUGH GONE SIR ON HER BICYCLE ON HER BICYCLE WHY SHE WENT SIR WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THIS TIME BECHAMEL WAS REALLY STARTLED
SAVE PERHAPS FOR A CURSE OR SO AT HIS PIPE AND THEN BREAK OUT WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF TIPS AVOID RUNNING OVER DOGS HOOPDRIVER WHATEVER YOU DO
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
BUT AS YET HE SEEMED MERELY STUNNED BROWN CLOTHES HE SAID AND FAIRISH A LITTLE LIKE YOURSELF SIR IN THE DARK THE OSTLER SIR JIM DUKE
THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
IT WASN'T THAT ONE AT ALL MISS SAID THE OSTLER I'D SWEAR WELL THAT'S MISTER BEAUMONT SAID THE BARMAID ANYHOW THEIR CONVERSATION HUNG COMATOSE IN THE AIR SWITCHED UP BY BECHAMEL

AN OTHER GENTLEMEN WHO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN BROWN SIR WENT INTO THE YARD SIR GOT OUT THE TWO BICYCLES SIR AND WENT OFF SIR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO BECHAMEL STOOD WITH HIS EYES ROUND AND HIS KNUCKLE ON HIS HIPS
ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR BROTHER MISS BEAUMONT YES WE COULD STOP THERE TOGETHER SHE TOOK A MINUTE TO ANSWER I AM GOING TO LIGHT THESE LAMPS SAID HOOPDRIVER HE BENT DOWN TO HIS OWN AND STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS SHOE

THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
ARE YOU TIRED HE ASKED I WILL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE THE TWO BLACK FIGURES IN THE BROKEN LIGHT WERE SILENT FOR A SPACE DO YOU KNOW SHE SAID I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU I AM SURE YOU ARE HONEST TO ME
WHAT WE HAD BEST BE DOING YOU ARE TIRED YOU KNOW AND WE CAN'T WANDER ALL NIGHT AFTER THE DAY WE'VE HAD THAT WAS CHICHESTER WE WERE NEAR SHE ASKED IF HE MEDITATED WITH A TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE
AFTER A PAUSE BECHAMEL WENT BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY HEARD A CHAIR CREAK UNDER HIM INTERLUDE OF CONVERSATIONAL EYEBROWS I'M GOING UP SAID STEPHEN TO BREAK THE MELANCHOLY NEWS TO HIM BECHAMEL LOOKED UP FROM A WEEK OLD NEWSPAPER
LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
HE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHAME OF HIS HOMELY PATRONYMIC IT'S AN UGLY NAME HE SAID BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN TRUSTING ME I WOULD I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU THIS
UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
THE LEFT AS ONE WHO KNEW SO IT WAS THAT IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR THEY CAME ABRUPTLY DOWN A LITTLE LANE FULL TILT UPON THE SEA
A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF
ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
TREACLE PUDDING HAD NOW DEFINITELY CEASED TO CHARM HASTILY WRAPPING THEIR PORTIONS IN A SPECTATOR OF THE WEEK BEFORE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST THEY HID THEM BEHIND THE CRINKLED PAPER STOVE ORNAMENT AND FLED UPSTAIRS TO RECONNOITRE
THE INDIANS HAD FORMED A RING ROUND THE CHILDREN AND NOW SAT ON THE GROUND GAZING AT THEIR CAPTIVES THERE WAS A THREATENING SILENCE THEN SLOWLY BY TWOS AND THREES THE INDIANS WHO HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR FIREWOOD CAME BACK AND THEY CAME BACK EMPTY HANDED
RIGHT OVER THE EDGE OF THE SAND PIT THEY WENT AMONG THE YELLOW AND PALE PURPLE FLOWERS AND DRIED GRASSES PAST THE LITTLE SAND MARTINS LITTLE FRONT DOORS SKIPPING CLINGING BOUNDING STUMBLING SPRAWLING AND FINALLY ROLLING
THESE WERE ALL ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AND THAT HEIGHT WAS CYRIL'S I HOPE TO GOODNESS THEY CAN TALK ENGLISH SAID CYRIL THROUGH HIS ATTITUDE ANTHEA KNEW THEY COULD THOUGH SHE NEVER KNEW HOW SHE CAME TO KNOW IT
IT'S SORT OF SUPERIOR TO HAVE A RED SKIN IF YOU ARE ONE THE RED OCHRE COOK USED FOR THE KITCHEN BRICKS SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE REDDEST THING IN THE HOUSE THE CHILDREN MIXED SOME IN A SAUCER WITH MILK AS THEY HAD SEEN COOK DO FOR THE KITCHEN FLOOR
SHE HAD A WHITE TOWEL TIED TO A WALKING STICK THIS WAS A FLAG OF TRUCE AND SHE WAVED IT IN THE HOPE THAT THE INDIANS WOULD KNOW WHAT IT WAS APPARENTLY THEY DID FOR ONE WHO WAS BROWNER THAN THE OTHERS STEPPED FORWARD
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GET IT TO DAY IN CASE MOTHER COMES HOME TO MORROW YOU KNOW SHE SAID SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BUT YOU'RE ALL GOING INTO TOWN YOURSELVES SAID MARTHA
WHILE JANE HUGGED HER MISERABLY AND SAID AT FIVE SECOND INTERVALS DON'T CRY PANTHER DEAR THEN SHE JUMPED UP RUBBED HER EYES HARD WITH THE CORNER OF HER PINAFORE
AH FOR THE BOUNDLESS FORESTS OF MY NATIVE LAND WHERE THE GREAT TREES FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES GROW BUT TO FURNISH FIREWOOD WHEREWITHAL TO BURN OUR FOES AH WOULD WE WERE BUT IN OUR NATIVE FOREST ONCE MORE
WITH THE MOST FAR SEEING PROMPTITUDE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER TORMENTS THAN THE SCALPING KNIFE AND THE FLAMES YET IS THE SLOW FIRE THE CORRECT THING O STRANGE UNNATURAL COUNTRY WHEREIN A MAN MAY FIND NO WOOD TO BURN HIS ENEMY
BUT HE WAS NOT PLEASED TO GET ONLY HALF A CROWN INSTEAD OF EIGHT SHILLINGS THEN THE GIRLS RAN HOME AGAIN ANTHEA WAS AGITATED BUT NOT FLURRIED WHEN SHE CAME TO THINK IT OVER AFTERWARDS SHE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT SHE HAD ACTED
NO ONE COULD MOVE SUDDENLY THE FEATHERED HEAD WAS CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWN AND THE SPELL WAS BROKEN I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT ANTHEA'S FIRST WORDS WERE VERY LIKE A GIRL THERE NOW SHE SAID I TOLD YOU SO
MY COUSIN SHE GIVE ME THE JUG FOR LUCK SHE SAID IT WAS AN ODD ONE WHAT THE BASIN OF HAD GOT SMASHED OH MARTHA
IF WE DRESSED UP AS LIKE INDIANS AS WE CAN AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS OR EVEN WENT OUT THEY MIGHT THINK WE WERE THE POWERFUL LEADERS OF A LARGE NEIGHBOURING TRIBE AND AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO US YOU KNOW FOR FEAR OF AWFUL VENGEANCE BUT ELIZA
YOU CAN'T BE REALLY SCALPED OR BURNED TO DEATH WITHOUT NOTICING IT AND YOU'D BE SURE TO NOTICE IT NEXT DAY EVEN IF IT ESCAPED YOUR ATTENTION AT THE TIME SAID CYRIL I THINK ANTHEA'S RIGHT BUT WE SHALL WANT A MOST AWFUL LOT OF FEATHERS I'LL GO DOWN TO THE HEN HOUSE SAID ROBERT
THERE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD THAT MADE THE IDEA OF RED INDIANS SEEM FLAT AND UNBELIEVABLE THE BOYS ACTUALLY LAUGHED AND CALLED ANTHEA A LITTLE SILLY WHY SAID CYRIL
SUDDENLY LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE GOLDEN GRAVEL SHONE ALL ROUND THE FOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF THE DUSKY FIGURES FOR EVERY SINGLE INDIAN HAD VANISHED ON THE INSTANT AT THEIR LEADER'S WORD
HAD BEEN GOT OFF ANTHEA DREW A DEEP BREATH HE'S SAFE SHE SAID AND TO JANE'S HORROR
LOOK IT'S MOST AWFULLY PRETTY ALL INLAID WITH REAL SILVER AND IVORY AND EBONY LIKE KING SOLOMON'S TEMPLE I SEE SAID MARTHA NO I DON'T WANT YOUR BOX MISS WHAT YOU WANT IS TO GET THE PRECIOUS LAMB OFF YOUR HANDS FOR THE AFTERNOON
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT SAID ANTHEA THE SAMMYADD SAID WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING THAT MEANS THEY'LL COME HERE AND SUPPOSE THEY SCALPED THE LAMB PERHAPS THE SCALPING WOULD COME RIGHT AGAIN AT SUNSET SAID JANE
AND THE COOK SAID JANE YOU FORGET THEY CAN'T NOTICE ANYTHING SAID ROBERT THEY WOULDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY EVEN IF THEY WERE SCALPED OR ROASTED AT A SLOW FIRE BUT WOULD THEY COME RIGHT AT SUNSET OF COURSE
THESE ALSO PUSSY FEROX OF THE PHITEEZI AND BOBS OF THE CAPE MOUNTED POLICE THESE ALSO HAVE LIED TO US IF NOT WITH THEIR TONGUE YET BY THEIR SILENCE
THE MAZAWATTEE TRIBE MY BROTHERS I DON'T MEAN YES I DO THE TRIBE I MEAN THE MAZAWATTEES ARE IN AMBUSH BELOW THE BROW OF YONDER HILL AND WHAT MIGHTY WARRIORS BE THESE ASKED GOLDEN EAGLE TURNING TO THE OTHERS
THEN THEY STUCK TURKEYS FEATHERS IN THE RIBBONS THE CALICO LOOKED VERY LIKE LONG BLACK HAIR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STRIPS BEGAN TO CURL UP A BIT BUT OUR FACES SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE NOT AT ALL THE RIGHT COLOUR
NO ONE EVER CAN AS A MATTER OF FACT IN THAT PART OF KENT THE CHILDREN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF BUT IT ENDED IN A MOAN OF TERROR FOR BRIGHT KNIVES WERE BEING BRANDISHED ALL ABOUT THEM NEXT MOMENT EACH CHILD WAS SEIZED BY AN INDIAN
YES GIGGLED MARTHA YOU'D BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF ME WHILE YOU'VE GOT ME I SHALL GIVE YOUR MA NOTICE DIRECTLY MINUTE SHE COMES BACK OH MARTHA WE HAVEN'T BEEN SO VERY HORRID TO YOU HAVE WE ASKED ANTHEA AGHAST
TURNING WITH A BITTER SMILE TO THE OTHER RED INDIANS BUILD WE THE FIRE SHOUTED HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT ONCE A DOZEN READY VOLUNTEERS STARTED TO LOOK FOR FUEL
AND AFTER THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO BE CALLED A LITTLE SILLY ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE HAD THE WEIGHT OF A BURGLARED MISSIONARY BOX AND ABOUT SEVEN AND FOURPENCE MOSTLY IN COPPERS LYING LIKE LEAD UPON HER CONSCIENCE
I BELIEVE IT'S THE FINE DAY THEN WHY DID THE SAMMYADD SAY WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING ASKED ANTHEA SHE WAS FEELING VERY CROSS SHE KNEW SHE HAD ACTED WITH NOBILITY AND DISCRETION
THE FOUR CHILDREN EACH HELD BETWEEN TWO STRONG LITTLE INDIANS CAST DESPAIRING GLANCES ROUND THEM OH IF THEY COULD ONLY SEE THE PSAMMEAD DO YOU MEAN TO SCALP US FIRST AND THEN ROAST US ASKED ANTHEA DESPERATELY
BUT AS FOR RED INDIANS WHY YOU KNOW JOLLY WELL THE WISHES ALWAYS COME THAT VERY MINUTE IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE RED INDIANS THEY'D BE HERE NOW I EXPECT THEY ARE SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE LURKING AMID THE UNDERGROWTH FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW
YE HAVE LIED UNDER THE COVER OF THE TRUCE FLAG OF THE PALE FACE YE HAVE NO FOLLOWERS YOUR TRIBES ARE FAR AWAY FOLLOWING THE HUNTING TRAIL WHAT SHALL BE THEIR DOOM HE CONCLUDED
BUT GOLDEN EAGLE ONLY LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HER THY CUSTOMS ARE OTHER THAN OURS O BLACK PANTHER HE SAID BRING UP THY TRIBE THAT WE MAY HOLD POW WOW IN STATE BEFORE THEM AS BECOMES GREAT CHIEFS
THE FOUR CHILDREN STARTED TO RUN THEIR FIRST RUSH KNOCKED DOWN SOME HALF DOZEN INDIANS OVER WHOSE BLANKETED BODIES THE CHILDREN LEAPED AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE SAND PIT THIS WAS NO TIME FOR THE SAFE EASY WAY BY WHICH CARTS GO DOWN
I CUT OFF THE FEATHERS AND WHEN I TURNED TO COME OUT THERE WAS AN INDIAN SQUINTING AT ME FROM UNDER THE OLD HEN COOP I JUST BRANDISHED THE FEATHERS AND YELLED AND GOT AWAY BEFORE HE COULD GET THE COOP OFF THE TOP OF HIMSELF PANTHER
EARNEST RECONNOITRING CONVINCED THEM ALL THAT NO INDIANS WERE IN THE POULTRY YARD ROBERT WENT IN FIVE MINUTES HE CAME BACK PALE BUT WITH MANY FEATHERS LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS JOLLY SERIOUS
THE STORY WAS RUNNING IN HIS HEAD AT BREAKFAST AND AS HE TOOK HIS THIRD CUP OF TEA HE SAID DREAMILY I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND NOT BIG ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE ONES JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR US TO FIGHT
AND NO ONE COULD AND EVERYONE KEPT EXPECTING SOMETHING AWFUL TO HAPPEN EVERY MINUTE IT WAS MOST AGITATING THEY KNEW FROM WHAT THE PSAMMEAD HAD SAID THAT THEY MUST HAVE WISHED FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN USUALLY UNDESIRABLE
AND TO DAY I SAID THE WORD AN MADE HIM A HAPPY MAN
JANE'LL FINISH LAYING THE CLOTH AND I'LL WASH THE LAMB AND GET HIM READY AS SHE WASHED THE UNWILLING LAMB AND HURRIED HIM INTO HIS BEST CLOTHES ANTHEA PEEPED OUT OF THE WINDOW FROM TIME TO TIME SO FAR ALL WAS WELL SHE COULD SEE NO RED INDIANS
SHE CARRIED IT INTO THE DRESSING ROOM AND CAREFULLY EMPTIED THE WATER OUT OF IT INTO THE BATH THEN SHE TOOK THE JUG BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR YOU KNOW HOW A JUG ALWAYS BREAKS IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT BY ACCIDENT
JANE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL HOW A PERSON COULD BE SO BRAVE AND LIKE A GENERAL AND THEN SUDDENLY GIVE WAY AND GO FLAT LIKE AN AIR BALLOON WHEN YOU PRICK IT
THEY ONLY FELT STRANGELY COOL WILD WAR WHOOPS RANG IN THEIR EARS WHEN THEY VENTURED TO OPEN THEIR EYES THEY SAW FOUR OF THEIR FOES DANCING ROUND THEM WITH WILD LEAPS AND SCREAMS AND EACH OF THE FOUR
AND SAT DOWN FLAT ON THE CARPET OH PUSSY HOW AWFUL IT WAS INDIANS HE WISHED FOR CYRIL AT BREAKFAST DON'T YOU REMEMBER HE SAID I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND AND NOW THERE ARE
YELLOW EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME UP WITH THEM JUST AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY HAD SEEN THE PSAMMEAD THAT MORNING BREATHLESS AND BEATEN THE WRETCHED CHILDREN NOW AWAITED THEIR FATE
NO FURTHER TRACE OF INDIANS HOWEVER COULD BE DISCERNED FROM THE WINDOWS WELL SAID ROBERT WHAT ARE WE TO DO THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF SAID ANTHEA WHO WAS NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED TO BE THE HEROINE OF THE DAY IS
DON'T YOU GO FOR TO THINK I DON'T SEE THROUGH YOU THIS WAS SO TRUE THAT ANTHEA LONGED TO DENY IT AT ONCE MARTHA HAD NO BUSINESS TO KNOW SO MUCH BUT SHE HELD HER TONGUE MARTHA SET DOWN THE BREAD WITH A BANG THAT MADE IT JUMP OFF ITS TRENCHER
SHARP KNIVES AND AXES GLEAMED ROUND THEM BUT WORSE THAN THESE WAS THE CRUEL LIGHT IN THE EYES OF GOLDEN EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS YE HAVE LIED TO US O BLACK PANTHER OF THE MAZAWATTEES AND THOU TOO SQUIRREL OF THE MONING CONGOS
THE PSAMMEAD MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND IT HAD GIVEN THE INDIAN CHIEF HIS WISH MARTHA BROUGHT HOME A JUG WITH A PATTERN OF STORKS AND LONG GRASSES ON IT ALSO SHE BROUGHT BACK ALL ANTHEA'S MONEY
IT WAS HEARTLESS WORK NEXT SHE BROKE OPEN THE MISSIONARY BOX WITH THE POKER JANE TOLD HER THAT IT WAS WRONG OF COURSE BUT ANTHEA SHUT HER LIPS VERY TIGHT AND THEN SAID DON'T BE SILLY IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
I DO WANT THE JUG GOT SAID ANTHEA SOFTLY YOU WILL GO WON'T YOU WELL JUST FOR THIS ONCE I DON'T MIND BUT MIND YOU DON'T GET INTO NONE OF YOUR OUTRAGEOUS MISCHIEF WHILE I'M GONE THAT'S ALL
YE SEEK A POW WOW HE SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH I AM GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE MIGHTY TRIBE OF ROCK DWELLERS AND I SAID ANTHEA WITH A SUDDEN INSPIRATION AM THE BLACK PANTHER
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS UP TO SOME MISCHIEF SAID MARTHA DUMPING DOWN A SALT CELLAR WITH A BANG DON'T BE CROSS MARTHA DEAR SAID ANTHEA I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A NEW ONE
THEY HAD ARRANGED TO PAY THE FARMER TWO SHILLINGS EACH FOR THE RIDE NOW ANTHEA HASTILY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY COULD NOT GO BUT WOULD HE TAKE MARTHA AND THE BABY INSTEAD HE AGREED
GET THE COLOURED BLANKETS OFF OUR BEDS AND LOOK SLIPPY CAN'T YOU IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LIKE AN INDIAN YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELVES WITH BLANKETS AND FEATHERS AND COLOURED SCARVES
IT WASN'T SAID JANE BRIEFLY WHY IF IT WAS INDIANS CYRIL WENT ON SALT PLEASE AND MUSTARD I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS MUSH GO DOWN IF IT WAS INDIANS THEY'D HAVE BEEN INFESTING THE PLACE LONG BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW THEY WOULD
NANA WAGGED HER TAIL RAN TO THE MEDICINE AND BEGAN LAPPING IT THEN SHE GAVE MISTER DARLING SUCH A LOOK NOT AN ANGRY LOOK SHE SHOWED HIM THE GREAT RED TEAR THAT MAKES US SO SORRY FOR NOBLE DOGS AND CREPT INTO HER KENNEL
FOR THE MOMENT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS IGNORANCE ABOUT KISSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT IT BACK HE SAID A LITTLE BITTERLY
NOW SAID HE SHALL I GIVE YOU A KISS AND SHE REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT PRIMNESS IF YOU PLEASE SHE MADE HERSELF RATHER CHEAP BY INCLINING HER FACE TOWARD HIM
YES SAID CUNNING PETER BUT WE ARE RATHER LONELY YOU SEE WE HAVE NO FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP ARE NONE OF THE OTHERS GIRLS OH NO GIRLS YOU KNOW ARE MUCH TOO CLEVER TO FALL OUT OF THEIR PRAMS THIS FLATTERED WENDY IMMENSELY I THINK SHE SAID
IT WILL SOON BE OVER FATHER JOHN SAID CHEERILY AND THEN IN RUSHED WENDY WITH THE MEDICINE IN A GLASS I HAVE BEEN AS QUICK AS I COULD
SHE RETURNED TO THE NURSERY AND FOUND NANA WITH SOMETHING IN HER MOUTH WHICH PROVED TO BE THE BOY'S SHADOW
THANK YOU KIND PARENTS FOR GIVING ME BOTTLES TO MAKE ME WELL HE REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS TRUE AND WENDY WHO WAS NOW IN HER NIGHT GOWN BELIEVED IT ALSO AND SHE SAID TO ENCOURAGE MICHAEL THAT MEDICINE YOU SOMETIMES TAKE FATHER
STILL SHE WOULD NOT LOOK UP THOUGH SHE WAS LISTENING EAGERLY WENDY HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE THAT NO WOMAN HAS EVER YET BEEN ABLE TO RESIST WENDY ONE GIRL IS MORE USE THAN TWENTY BOYS
HE SAID AND OF COURSE THE LADY IN THE EVENING DRESS COULD NOT STAND THAT I DO SHE SAID I SO WANT A THIRD CHILD BOY OR GIRL ASKED MICHAEL NOT TOO HOPEFULLY BOY THEN HE HAD LEAPT INTO HER ARMS
HE SAID EXAMINING IT CAREFULLY BUT IT DOES LOOK A SCOUNDREL WE WERE STILL DISCUSSING IT YOU REMEMBER SAYS MISTER DARLING WHEN NANA CAME IN WITH MICHAEL'S MEDICINE
IN A HORRID SILENCE MISSUS DARLING SMELT THE BOWL O GEORGE SHE SAID IT'S YOUR MEDICINE
HE ROARED WHILE SHE COMFORTED HER BOYS AND WENDY HUGGED NANA MUCH GOOD HE SAID BITTERLY MY WEARING MYSELF TO THE BONE TRYING TO BE FUNNY IN THIS HOUSE AND STILL WENDY HUGGED NANA
MANY A TIME IT WAS MISTER DARLING WHO PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF TO NANA'S EYES THAT FIEND MISTER DARLING WOULD CRY AND NANA'S BARK WAS THE ECHO OF IT BUT MISSUS DARLING NEVER UPBRAIDED PETER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER OF HER MOUTH
I SHALL POUR MY MEDICINE INTO NANA'S BOWL AND SHE WILL DRINK IT THINKING IT IS MILK IT WAS THE COLOUR OF MILK BUT THE CHILDREN DID NOT HAVE THEIR FATHER'S SENSE OF HUMOUR AND THEY LOOKED AT HIM REPROACHFULLY AS HE POURED THE MEDICINE INTO NANA'S BOWL WHAT FUN
HE LURED HER OUT OF IT WITH HONEYED WORDS AND SEIZING HER ROUGHLY DRAGGED HER FROM THE NURSERY
MISTER DARLING DEMANDED STOP THAT ROW MICHAEL I MEANT TO TAKE MINE BUT I I MISSED IT IT WAS DREADFUL THE WAY ALL THE THREE WERE LOOKING AT HIM JUST AS IF THEY DID NOT ADMIRE HIM LOOK HERE ALL OF YOU HE SAID ENTREATINGLY
WENDY I RAN AWAY THE DAY I WAS BORN WENDY WAS QUITE SURPRISED BUT INTERESTED AND SHE INDICATED IN THE CHARMING DRAWING ROOM MANNER
DEAR ONE I FEEL SURE SHE KNOWS THEY HAVE SOULS I WONDER MISTER DARLING SAID THOUGHTFULLY
BOY SHE SAID COURTEOUSLY
BUT THEY ARE SO FOND OF FUN THAT THEY WERE ON HIS SIDE TO NIGHT AND ANXIOUS TO GET THE GROWN UPS OUT OF THE WAY SO
WENDY LOVED TO LEND HER BRACELET TO HER MOTHER
BUT SHE WAS EXULTING IN HIS IGNORANCE
AND PETER DROPPED IN HE HAD CARRIED TINKER BELL PART OF THE WAY AND HIS HAND WAS STILL MESSY WITH THE FAIRY DUST TINKER BELL HE CALLED SOFTLY AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP TINK WHERE ARE YOU SHE WAS IN A JUG FOR THE MOMENT AND LIKING IT EXTREMELY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A JUG BEFORE
IT LOOKED SO LIKE THE WASHING AND LOWERED THE WHOLE TONE OF THE HOUSE SHE THOUGHT OF SHOWING IT TO MISTER DARLING BUT HE WAS TOTTING UP WINTER GREAT COATS FOR JOHN AND MICHAEL
BUT HE HAD NO PITY FOR HER WENDY HE SAID THE SLY ONE YOU COULD TUCK US IN AT NIGHT O O NONE OF US HAS EVER BEEN TUCKED IN AT NIGHT O O AND HER ARMS WENT OUT TO HIM AND YOU COULD DARN OUR CLOTHES AND MAKE POCKETS FOR US
HIS PROUD HEART WAS NEARLY BURSTING AND IT ISN'T FAIR
FORTUNATELY AS WE HAVE MENTIONED ONE OF HIS HANDS WAS MESSY WITH IT AND HE BLEW SOME ON EACH OF THEM WITH THE MOST SUPERB RESULTS NOW JUST WIGGLE YOUR SHOULDERS THIS WAY HE SAID AND LET GO THEY WERE ALL ON THEIR BEDS AND GALLANT MICHAEL LET GO FIRST
IT WAS LIKE AN EXAMINATION PAPER THAT ASKS GRAMMAR WHEN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ASKED IS KINGS OF ENGLAND I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED UNEASILY BUT I AM QUITE YOUNG
WITH NANA PUTTING ON THE WATER FOR MICHAEL'S BATH AND CARRYING HIM TO IT ON HER BACK I WON'T GO TO BED HE HAD SHOUTED
AND SNAPPED IT OFF YOU MAY BE SURE MISSUS DARLING EXAMINED THE SHADOW CAREFULLY
WE NOW RETURN TO THE NURSERY IT'S ALL RIGHT JOHN ANNOUNCED EMERGING FROM HIS HIDING PLACE I SAY PETER CAN YOU REALLY FLY INSTEAD OF TROUBLING TO ANSWER HIM PETER FLEW AROUND THE ROOM TAKING THE MANTELPIECE ON THE WAY
SHE WENT FROM BED TO BED SINGING ENCHANTMENTS OVER THEM AND LITTLE MICHAEL FLUNG HIS ARMS ROUND HER MOTHER HE CRIED I'M GLAD OF YOU THEY WERE THE LAST WORDS SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM HIM FOR A LONG TIME
CHAPTER TWO THE SHADOW MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED AND AS IF IN ANSWER TO A BELL THE DOOR OPENED AND NANA ENTERED RETURNED FROM HER EVENING OUT SHE GROWLED AND SPRANG AT THE BOY WHO LEAPT LIGHTLY THROUGH THE WINDOW
WHICH STORY WAS IT ABOUT THE PRINCE WHO COULDN'T FIND THE LADY WHO WORE THE GLASS SLIPPER PETER SAID WENDY EXCITEDLY THAT WAS CINDERELLA AND HE FOUND HER AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER
JOHN THERE JUST DESPISES US FOR REPLY PETER ROSE AND KICKED JOHN OUT OF BED BLANKETS AND ALL ONE KICK
HALLO HE SAID I AM UP MICHAEL WAS UP BY THIS TIME ALSO LOOKING AS SHARP AS A KNIFE WITH SIX BLADES AND A SAW BUT PETER SUDDENLY SIGNED SILENCE THEIR FACES ASSUMED THE AWFUL CRAFTINESS OF CHILDREN LISTENING FOR SOUNDS FROM THE GROWN UP WORLD ALL WAS AS STILL AS SALT THEN EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT
TINK SAID THAT THE SHADOW WAS IN THE BIG BOX SHE MEANT THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER JUMPED AT THE DRAWERS SCATTERING THEIR CONTENTS TO THE FLOOR WITH BOTH HANDS AS KINGS TOSS HA'PENCE TO THE CROWD
O PETER NO WONDER YOU WERE CRYING SHE SAID AND GOT OUT OF BED AND RAN TO HIM
WENDY CRIED ALWAYS GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE I'LL BRING IT AND SHE WAS OFF BEFORE HE COULD STOP HER IMMEDIATELY HIS SPIRITS SANK IN THE STRANGEST WAY JOHN HE SAID SHUDDERING IT'S MOST BEASTLY STUFF IT'S THAT NASTY STICKY SWEET KIND
GEORGE GEORGE MISSUS DARLING WHISPERED REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT BOY ALAS HE WOULD NOT LISTEN HE WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW WHO WAS MASTER IN THAT HOUSE AND WHEN COMMANDS WOULD NOT DRAW NANA FROM THE KENNEL
FOR A MOMENT AFTER MISTER AND MISSUS DARLING LEFT THE HOUSE THE NIGHT LIGHTS BY THE BEDS OF THE THREE CHILDREN CONTINUED TO BURN CLEARLY
HOW EXACTLY LIKE A BOY FORTUNATELY SHE KNEW AT ONCE WHAT TO DO IT MUST BE SEWN ON SHE SAID JUST A LITTLE PATRONISINGLY WHAT'S SEWN HE ASKED
MISTER DARLING WAS FRIGHTFULLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
THEN JOHN WAS BORN WITH THE EXTRA POMP THAT HE CONCEIVED DUE TO THE BIRTH OF A MALE AND MICHAEL CAME FROM HIS BATH TO ASK TO BE BORN ALSO BUT JOHN SAID BRUTALLY THAT THEY DID NOT WANT ANY MORE MICHAEL HAD NEARLY CRIED NOBODY WANTS ME
AND I'LL GET UP AGAIN AND SHE SAT WITH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE BED
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY YOU ARE WAITING SO AM I WAITING FATHER'S A COWARDLY CUSTARD SO ARE YOU A COWARDLY CUSTARD I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NEITHER AM I FRIGHTENED WELL THEN TAKE IT
HE THOUGHT HE HAD ATTACHED THE SHADOW HIMSELF HOW CLEVER I AM HE CROWED RAPTUROUSLY OH THE CLEVERNESS OF ME IT IS HUMILIATING TO HAVE TO CONFESS THAT THIS CONCEIT OF PETER WAS ONE OF HIS MOST FASCINATING QUALITIES
THERE WAS A COMMOTION IN THE FIRMAMENT
WENDY HE SAID HOW WE SHOULD ALL RESPECT YOU
WENDY'S HEART WENT FLUTTER WITH A SUDDEN THRILL PETER SHE CRIED CLUTCHING HIM
WHILE THE CHILDREN STOOD AROUND TO SEE THEIR FATE DECIDED SOME MEN WOULD HAVE RESENTED HER BEING ABLE TO DO IT SO EASILY BUT MISTER DARLING HAD FAR TOO FINE A NATURE FOR THAT HE THANKED HER CARELESSLY AT ONCE FORGOT HIS RAGE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS DANCING ROUND THE ROOM
FOR IT WAS AFTERWARDS TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN PEOPLE IN OUR SET ARE INTRODUCED IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THEM TO ASK EACH OTHER'S AGE AND SO WENDY WHO ALWAYS LIKED TO DO THE CORRECT THING ASKED PETER HOW OLD HE WAS
I REMEMBER THEY WERE RATHER SWEET DON'T YOU THINK GEORGE AND THEY WERE OURS OURS AND NOW THEY ARE GONE THE ROMP HAD ENDED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NANA AND MOST UNLUCKILY MISTER DARLING COLLIDED AGAINST HER COVERING HIS TROUSERS WITH HAIRS
AGAIN MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED THIS TIME IN DISTRESS FOR HIM FOR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS KILLED AND SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE STREET TO LOOK FOR HIS LITTLE BODY BUT IT WAS NOT THERE AND SHE LOOKED UP AND IN THE BLACK NIGHT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR
NOT ONE OF THEM COULD FLY AN INCH THOUGH EVEN MICHAEL WAS IN WORDS OF TWO SYLLABLES AND PETER DID NOT KNOW A FROM Z
WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHE CRIED WITH MISGIVING TO TELL THE OTHER BOYS DON'T GO PETER SHE ENTREATED I KNOW SUCH LOTS OF STORIES
HE HAD CLIMBED IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE WARDROBE AND HIDDEN IT THERE
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME EXCUSE FOR HIM HE TOO HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR THE PARTY AND ALL HAD GONE WELL WITH HIM
WHY TINK AGAIN TINK REPLIED YOU SILLY ASS PETER COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY BUT WENDY UNDERSTOOD
NO STOP EVERYTHING WAS WRONG NANA WHO HAD BEEN BARKING DISTRESSFULLY ALL THE EVENING WAS QUIET NOW IT WAS HER SILENCE THEY HAD HEARD
HOW SWEET CRIED WENDY YES I'M SWEET OH I AM SWEET SAID PETER FORGETTING HIS MANNERS AGAIN IT LOOKED DELIGHTFULLY EASY AND THEY TRIED IT FIRST FROM THE FLOOR AND THEN FROM THE BEDS BUT THEY ALWAYS WENT DOWN INSTEAD OF UP I SAY HOW DO YOU DO IT ASKED JOHN RUBBING HIS KNEE HE WAS QUITE A PRACTICAL BOY
THE SOUND CAME FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER MADE A MERRY FACE
NANA KNEW THAT KIND OF BREATHING AND SHE TRIED TO DRAG HERSELF OUT OF LIZA'S CLUTCHES BUT LIZA WAS DENSE NO MORE OF IT NANA SHE SAID STERNLY PULLING HER OUT OF THE ROOM
HOWEVER JOHN CONTINUED TO SLEEP SO PLACIDLY ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO REMAIN THERE AND I KNOW YOU MEANT TO BE KIND SHE SAID RELENTING
BUT THIS MAN THOUGH HE KNEW ABOUT STOCKS AND SHARES HAD NO REAL MASTERY OF HIS TIE SOMETIMES THE THING YIELDED TO HIM WITHOUT A CONTEST
IF YOU LIKE HE SAID INDIFFERENTLY AND SHE RAN TO JOHN AND MICHAEL AND SHOOK THEM WAKE UP SHE CRIED PETER PAN HAS COME AND HE IS TO TEACH US TO FLY JOHN RUBBED HIS EYES
AS SOON AS NANA HAD GONE INTO THE BATHROOM
MICHAEL CRIED NAUGHTILY MISSUS DARLING LEFT THE ROOM TO GET A CHOCOLATE FOR HIM AND MISTER DARLING THOUGHT THIS SHOWED WANT OF FIRMNESS MOTHER DON'T PAMPER HIM HE CALLED AFTER HER MICHAEL WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I TOOK MEDICINE WITHOUT A MURMUR I SAID
BUT NOT SO LITTLE IF THAT WAS TO BE MICHAEL'S LAST NIGHT IN THE NURSERY THEY GO ON WITH THEIR RECOLLECTIONS IT WAS THEN THAT I RUSHED IN LIKE A TORNADO WASN'T IT MISTER DARLING WOULD SAY SCORNING HIMSELF AND INDEED HE HAD BEEN LIKE A TORNADO
I NEVER GO TO THE OFFICE AGAIN AND IF I DON'T GO TO THE OFFICE AGAIN YOU AND I STARVE AND OUR CHILDREN WILL BE FLUNG INTO THE STREETS EVEN THEN MISSUS DARLING WAS PLACID LET ME TRY DEAR SHE SAID AND INDEED THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD COME TO ASK HER TO DO
WITH MICHAEL ON HIS BACK HOW WILDLY WE ROMPED SAYS MISSUS DARLING NOW RECALLING IT OUR LAST ROMP MISTER DARLING GROANED
OF COURSE I DID NOTHING YOU DID A LITTLE PETER SAID CARELESSLY AND CONTINUED TO DANCE
WAS WHAT NANA'S WET EYES SAID MY LIKING FOR PARTIES GEORGE MY FATAL GIFT OF HUMOUR DEAREST MY TOUCHINESS ABOUT TRIFLES DEAR MASTER AND MISTRESS
AT FIRST HE POOH POOHED THE STORY BUT HE BECAME THOUGHTFUL WHEN SHE SHOWED HIM THE SHADOW
BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THIS NOR THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE SMALLER ONES WINKED AT HER YET A NAMELESS FEAR CLUTCHED AT HER HEART AND MADE HER CRY
AND FATHER AND MOTHER DARLING PICKED THEIR WAY OVER IT DEFTLY NOT TO SOIL THEIR SHOES THEY WERE ALREADY THE ONLY PERSONS IN THE STREET AND ALL THE STARS WERE WATCHING THEM STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY MAY NOT TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN ANYTHING THEY MUST JUST LOOK ON FOR EVER
PETER PAN SHE WAS ALREADY SURE THAT HE MUST BE PETER BUT IT DID SEEM A COMPARATIVELY SHORT NAME IS THAT ALL YES HE SAID RATHER SHARPLY HE FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS A SHORTISH NAME I'M SO SORRY SAID WENDY MOIRA ANGELA IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER GULPED
COME ON FATHER SAID JOHN HOLD YOUR TONGUE JOHN HIS FATHER RAPPED OUT WENDY WAS QUITE PUZZLED I THOUGHT YOU TOOK IT QUITE EASILY FATHER
I WON'T I WON'T NANA IT ISN'T SIX O'CLOCK YET OH DEAR OH DEAR I SHAN'T LOVE YOU ANY MORE NANA I TELL YOU I WON'T BE BATHED I WON'T I WON'T THEN MISSUS DARLING HAD COME IN WEARING HER WHITE EVENING GOWN SHE HAD DRESSED EARLY BECAUSE WENDY SO LOVED TO SEE HER IN HER EVENING GOWN
