ALL THE PIRATES THAT SURRENDERED WERE TAKEN TO JAMAICA AND TRIED BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY COURT
AND SWORE THAT HE AND ALL HIS COMRADES WOULD PERISH WITHIN THEIR TRENCHES BEFORE THEY WOULD SURRENDER TO ANY MAN FOUR OF THIS GANG HAVING GONE TO NEW ORLEANS ON A FROLIC INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO THE CITY WATCH AND THE HOUSE SURROUNDED
AND THE OCEAN WOULD BE AS CROWDED WITH ROGUES AS THE LAND SO THAT NO MERCHANTS WOULD VENTURE OUT AND THE TRADE IN A LITTLE TIME WOULD NOT BE WORTH FOLLOWING
AND TOLD THE CAPTAIN OF THE SPEAKER WHOSE NAME I WON'T MENTION THAT HE WAS HIS PRISONER HE ASKED UPON WHAT ACCOUNT
YOU MAY COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY SENDING A BOAT TO THE EASTERN POINT OF THE PASS WHERE I WILL BE FOUND YOU HAVE INSPIRED ME WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAN THE ADMIRAL YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER COULD HAVE DONE HIMSELF WITH YOU ALONE I WISH TO DEAL
NOR EVEN AT THIS MOMENT CAN I GIVE YOU ALL THE SATISFACTION THAT YOU DESIRE HOWEVER IF YOU COULD GRANT ME A FORTNIGHT I WOULD BE ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISPOSAL AT THE END OF THAT TIME THIS DELAY IS INDISPENSABLE TO ENABLE ME TO PUT MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER
THEY DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TO THAT PLACE WHEN ARRIVED THERE THEY INFORMED THE MERCHANTS OF THE UNFORTUNATE DEATH OF SKINNER AND OF THE PROPOSAL WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM
THERE IS ALSO THE ISLAND OF BARRATARIA AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH IS A PLACE CALLED THE TEMPLE WHICH DENOMINATION IT OWES TO SEVERAL MOUNDS OF SHELLS THROWN UP THERE BY THE INDIANS THE NAME OF BARRATARIA IS ALSO GIVEN TO A LARGE BASIN
THEIR ZEAL THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR SKILL WERE REMARKED BY THE WHOLE ARMY WHO COULD NO LONGER CONSIDER SUCH BRAVE MEN AS CRIMINALS IN A FEW DAYS PEACE WAS DECLARED BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES
UPON THEIR RETURN THEY CLEANED THEIR SHIP AND PUT TO SEA
AND WAS MADE A PORT OF ENTRY THE NINTH OCTOBER LAST AND WHEREAS THE SUPREME CONGRESS OF SAID REPUBLIC HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO APPOINT ME AS GOVERNOR OF THIS PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH IF YOU HAVE ANY DEMANDS ON SAID GOVERNMENT OR PERSONS BELONGING TO OR RESIDING IN THE SAME
INCREASED WITH HER YEARS AND LEAVING THAT SERVILE EMPLOYMENT SHE ENGAGED ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR THE VOLATILE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUTH DID NOT PERMIT HER TO REMAIN LONG IN THIS STATION AND SHE NEXT WENT INTO FLANDERS AND JOINED A REGIMENT OF FOOT AS A CADET
THE PERSONS WHO HAD PROPOSED TO SEND THE BRITISH OFFICERS PRISONERS TO NEW ORLEANS WENT AND SEIZED THEM IN HIS ABSENCE AND CONFINED BOTH THEM AND THE CREW OF THE PINNACE IN A SECURE PLACE LEAVING A GUARD AT THE DOOR
MISTER BLANQUE IMMEDIATELY LAID ITS CONTENTS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WHO CONVENED THE COMMITTEE OF DEFENCE LATELY FORMED OF WHICH HE WAS PRESIDENT AND MISTER RANCHER THE BEARER OF LAFITTE'S PACKET WAS SENT BACK WITH A VERBAL ANSWER TO DESIRE LAFITTE TO TAKE NO STEPS UNTIL IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED
HAD NOT HIS MEN PREVENTED HIM CAPTAIN DAVIS THEN FORMED THE RESOLUTION OF PARTING WITH THE OTHER PRIZE SHIP ALSO AND
HE REMAINED HERE FIVE WEEKS AND HE AND HALF OF HIS CREW VISITED THE PRINCIPAL TOWN OF THE ISLAND DAVIS FROM HIS APPEARING IN THE DRESS OF A GENTLEMAN WAS GREATLY CARESSED BY THE PORTUGUESE
WITH A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA
HE CONTINUED ON BOARD THIS SHIP IN WHICH HE WAS MADE QUARTER MASTER TILL THEY MET WITH AND ALL WENT ON BOARD OF BOWEN AS IS SET DOWN IN HIS LIFE IN WHICH SHIP HE CONTINUED AFTER BOWEN LEFT THEM
BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN REPRESENTED THAT THE OFFENDERS HAVE MANIFESTED A SINCERE PENITENCE THAT THEY HAVE ABANDONED THE PROSECUTION OF THE WORST CAUSE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE BEST AND PARTICULARLY THAT THEY HAVE EXHIBITED IN THE DEFENCE OF NEW ORLEANS
THEY STAYED HERE ALL THE MONSOON TIME WHICH IS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH THEY RESOLVED FOR MADAGASCAR AS THEY CAME IN WITH THE LAND THEY SPIED A SAIL COMING ROUND FROM THE EAST SIDE OF THE ISLAND THEY GAVE CHASE ON BOTH SIDES SO THAT THEY SOON MET
I HAVE THEREFORE DEEMED IT PROPER TO INQUIRE INTO THE CAUSE OF YOUR LIVING BEFORE THIS PORT WITHOUT COMMUNICATING YOUR INTENTION I SHALL BY THIS MESSAGE INFORM YOU THAT THE PORT OF GALVEZTON BELONGS TO AND IS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS
THAT SHE TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF ENJOYING HIS COMPANY AND CONVERSATION AND AFTER SHE HAD GAINED HIS FRIENDSHIP DISCOVERED HER SEX
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND GAVE CHASE THE STRANGE SAIL STANDING FOR GRAND TERRE WITH ALL SAIL AT HALF PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK THE CHASE HAULED HER WIND OFF SHORE TO ESCAPE
WHAT WAS EXPEDIENT TO BE DONE THE MESSAGE ALSO CONTAINED AN ASSURANCE THAT IN THE MEANTIME NO STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST HIM FOR HIS PAST OFFENCES AGAINST THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE TIME AGREED ON WITH CAPTAIN LOCKYER
THAN CALLING A FEW OF HIS BEST MEN BY HIS SIDE HE SPRUNG FORWARD TO THE POINT OF DANGER AND CLEARING THE BREASTWORK OF THE ENTRENCHMENTS LEAPED CUTLASS IN HAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY FOLLOWED BY A SCORE OF HIS MEN WHO IN MANY A HARD FOUGHT BATTLE UPON HIS OWN DECK
IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN THEY PROVED IN AN UNEQUIVOCAL MANNER THAT THEY HAD BEEN MISJUDGED BY THE ENEMY WHO A SHORT TIME PREVIOUS TO THE INVASION OF LOUISIANA HAD HOPED TO ENLIST THEM IN HIS CAUSE MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED IN THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY
THE GUNS WERE CAST LOOSE AND THE SHOT HANDED UP AND A FIRE OPENED UPON THE SHIP WHICH KILLED A NUMBER OF MEN AND CARRIED AWAY HER FORETOPMAST BUT SHE RESERVED HER FIRE UNTIL WITHIN CABLE'S DISTANCE OF THE PIRATE WHEN SHE FIRED A GENERAL DISCHARGE FROM HER BROADSIDE AND A VOLLEY OF SMALL ARMS
AND ASSIST IN TAKING THE SHIP AFTER SOME DAYS THE CAPTAIN OF THE SPEAKER CAME ON SHORE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT CIVILITY BY THE HEADS OF THE PIRATES HAVING AGREED BEFORE TO MAKE SATISFACTION IN A DAY OR TWO AFTER HE WAS INVITED BY THEM TO EAT A BARBACUED SHOAT
BUT THE DIFFICULTY AND DANGER FAR FROM DISCOURAGING THIS INTREPID SAILOR ACTED AS AN ADDITIONAL SPUR TO HIS BRILLIANT VALOR AFTER ELECTRIFYING HIS CREW WITH A FEW WORDS OF HOPE AND ARDOR
AND TO RECEIVE FROM THEM INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SO CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY HE ACCORDINGLY WROTE ON THE FOURTH SEPTEMBER TO MISTER BLANQUE ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE SENDING HIM ALL THE PAPERS DELIVERED TO HIM BY THE BRITISH OFFICERS
ABOUT THIS TIME ONE MITCHELL WHO HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO LAFITTE'S GANG COLLECTED UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DESPERADOES AND FORTIFIED HIMSELF ON AN ISLAND NEAR BARRATARIA WITH SEVERAL PIECES OF CANNON
HE HERE TOOK TWO GRABS LADEN WITH PROVISIONS AND HAVING SOME SMALL MONEY AND DRUGS ABOARD THESE HE PLUNDERED OF WHAT WAS FOR HIS TURN KEPT THEM A FORTNIGHT BY HIM AND LET THEM GO
FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HIS FORMER PRUDENCE AND COURAGE THEY CHEERFULLY SUBMITTED TO HIS DIRECTION IN THE FULL ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS ARRIVED AT GAMBIA HE ORDERED ALL HIS MEN BELOW EXCEPT JUST SO MANY AS WERE NECESSARY TO WORK THE VESSEL
I DECLARE TO YOU THAT I WILL INSTANTLY LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO AVOID THE IMPUTATION OF HAVING COOPERATED TOWARDS AN INVASION ON THIS POINT WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO TAKE PLACE AND TO REST SECURE IN THE ACQUITTAL OF MY CONSCIENCE
ONE OF THESE GUNS A TWENTY FOUR POUNDER PLACED UPON THE BREASTWORK IN THE THIRD EMBRASURE FROM THE RIVER DREW FROM THE FATAL SKILL AND ACTIVITY WITH WHICH IT WAS MANAGED EVEN IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE THE ADMIRATION OF BOTH AMERICANS AND BRITISH
MOUNTING TWENTY GUNS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND SAILED FOR GAUDALOUPE AMONGST THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS HE MADE SEVERAL VALUABLE PRIZES BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE ON A CRUISE THE ISLAND HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY THE BRITISH
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE PUNISHMENT LESS THAN DEATH THE FEAR OF WHICH KEPT SOME DASTARDLY ROGUES HONEST THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE NOW CHEATING THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND OPPRESSING THEIR POOR NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE NO MONEY TO OBTAIN JUSTICE WOULD THEN ROB AT SEA
HERE THEY TOOK IN A QUANTITY OF FRESH PROVISIONS WHICH ARE IN THIS ISLAND VERY PLENTIFUL AND VERY CHEAP AND FOUND A TWELVE OARED BOAT WHICH FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE RUBY EAST INDIAMAN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST THERE
THAN THAT OF HER OWN BUT SHE COULD NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT HE COULD REFUSE TO FIGHT AND SO BE ESTEEMED A COWARD ACCORDINGLY SHE QUARRELLED WITH THE MAN WHO CHALLENGED HER LOVER AND CALLED HIM TO THE FIELD TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT WITH HER LOVER
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAUSED THE ESTABLISHMENT TO BE BROKEN UP AND DESTROYED AND HAVING OBTAINED THE MEANS OF DESIGNATING THE OFFENDERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION IT ONLY REMAINED TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE BY INFLICTING AN EXEMPLARY PUNISHMENT
PERCEIVED THE PIRATES FORMING THEIR VESSELS TEN IN NUMBER INCLUDING PRIZES INTO A LINE OF BATTLE NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE HARBOR AND MAKING EVERY PREPARATION TO OFFER ME BATTLE AT TEN O'CLOCK WIND LIGHT AND VARIABLE
DOWN CAME THE DAGGER INTO THE CAPTAIN'S LEFT THIGH
THAT THEY REMAINED IN THE ISLAND AND ONE OF THEM MARRIED AND SETTLED THERE DAVIS NOW SAILED FOR BONAVISTA AND PERCEIVING NOTHING IN THAT HARBOR STEERED FOR THE ISLE OF MAY
AND HIS CREW REQUESTING THEM TO GO TO BRAZIL AND DISPOSE OF THE CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE AND MAKE AN EQUAL DIVISION OF THE MONEY DAVIS THEN COMMANDED THE CREW TO SIGNIFY WHETHER THEY WERE INCLINED TO FOLLOW THAT MODE OF LIFE WHEN
DO YOU CALL HIM AN HONEST MAN HOW AM I TO ANSWER YOU JUST THE TRUTH IF YOU WILL HAVE AN ANSWER I DO NOT CONSIDER HIM AN HONEST MAN ALL THIS STORY ABOUT YOUR BROTHER IS TRUE OR IS NOT TRUE
THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY MISTER JONES AS TO HARRY ANNESLEY HAD ONLY BEEN A REFLEX OF THAT FELT BY AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH BUT THE REFLEX AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN THE LOOKING GLASS IS TRUE WAS CORRECT
I'M HOST HERE AND OF COURSE WILL GIVE WAY TO ANYTHING YOU MAY PROPOSE WHAT'S IT TO BE SCARBOROUGH POUNDS AND FIVES I SHAN'T PLAY HIGHER THAN THAT
IT BECAME TO HIM UTTERLY CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE
BUT WAITING FOR MY DEATH FROM DAY TO DAY HE IS A COLD BLOODED SELFISH BRUTE
NOW YOU ARE NOT HALF AS CLEVER A FELLOW AS HE IS
NEW ASPIRATIONS AND A STRANGE COMPANION THE CHANGE MUST BE SO COMPLETE AS ALMOST TO FRIGHTEN HER BY ITS AWFULNESS AND YET IT HAS TO BE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AND GENERALLY DONE
THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING SETTLED ABOUT POOR PATRICK'S CLOTHES SAID MISSUS CARROLL IN A HALF WHISPER SHE DID NOT CARE HOW MUCH HER OWN CHILDREN HEARD
OR CARED TO INQUIRE HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED AS MAJOR MOODY FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE AND TWENTY YEARS IS SURELY TIME ENOUGH TO SETTLE A MAN'S CLAIM TO A MAJORITY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ARMY LIST HOW ARE YOU MAJOR MOODY ASKED MOUNTJOY
HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHO COULD BEAR SUCH TYRANNY WELL I CAN FORGIVE MY FATHER HE SAID BUT AUGUSTUS I WILL NEVER FORGIVE
AT WHICH HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED NOW SHE CAME FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THAT PERIOD HAD ARRIVED
NOW SCARBOROUGH YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT ONCE FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE TALKED DOWN IF YOU WANT TO TALK A FELLOW DOWN YOU CAN GO TO WALKER BROWN OR GREEN THEN WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THE OCCUPATION YOU CAN COME BACK TO ME
IT WAS A WRITTEN PROMISE TO PAY TO CAPTAIN VIGNOLLES THE EXACT SUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN POUNDS ON OR BEFORE THAT DAY WEEK YOU'LL BE PUNCTUAL WON'T YOU OF COURSE I'LL BE PUNCTUAL SAID MOUNTJOY SCOWLING WELL YES NO DOUBT
THE CARROLL FAMILY AUNT CARROLL IS COMING TO DINNER TO DAY SAID DOLLY THE NEXT DAY WITH A SERIOUS FACE I KNOW SHE IS HAVE A NICE DINNER FOR HER I DON'T THINK SHE EVER HAS A NICE DINNER AT HOME
ALLOWED HIS BOOTS AND HIS GLOVES AND HIS CHURCH GOING HAT AND HIS CHURCH GOING UMBRELLA TO BE BROUGHT TO HIM IT WAS IN FACT HIS AVERSION TO THESE ARTICLES THAT DOLLY HAD TO ENCOUNTER IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THE CHURCH SERVICES OF THAT DAY DID MISTER GREY MUCH GOOD
CHAPTER TWELVE HARRY ANNESLEY'S SUCCESS HARRY ANNESLEY A DAY OR TWO AFTER HE HAD LEFT TRETTON
YES I I DON'T DENY THAT I'M THE LUCKIEST FELLOW GOING BUT I NEVER CAN REMEMBER CARDS OF COURSE I KNOW MY TRADE EVERY FELLOW KNOWS HIS TRADE AND I'M UP PRETTY NEARLY IN ALL THAT THE BOOKS TELL YOU THAT'S A GREAT DEAL
BUT THIS CHANGE HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO FLORENCE IN A MANNER MORE THAN ORDINARILY BURDENSOME EARLY IN LIFE WHEN NATURALLY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEGUN TO THINK SERIOUSLY OF MARRIAGE SHE HAD BEEN TOLD RATHER THAN ASKED TO GIVE HERSELF
AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM A KEENER PERCEPTION OF HIS IMPERIOUSNESS SHE COULD CONSENT TO BECOME THE WIFE OF THE MAN WHO HAD SQUANDERED HIS PROPERTY AND WASTED HIS ESTATE BUT NOT OF ONE WHO BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE DEMANDED OF HER THAT SUBMISSION WHICH
YOU NEEDN'T TELL HIM BUT SO IT MUST BE IF I HAD MY WAY SAID DOLLY AFTER TEN MINUTES SILENCE I WOULD PUNISH HIM
I DO NOT KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT HARRY AT THIS MOMENT LOOKED UP AND CAUGHT THE EYE OF MISSUS MOUNTJOY AS SHE WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY OPPOSITE
GO THERE PREPARED WITH YOUR OPINION BUT IF EITHER FATHER OR SON WILL NOT ACCEPT IT THEN DEPART AND SHAKE THE DUST FROM YOUR FEET YOU PROPOSE IT ALL AS THOUGH IT WERE THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD
FALSELY CONSCIOUS AND DID FEEL THAT IF HARRY'S CHARACTER WERE REALLY KNOWN NO GIRL WOULD IN TRUTH PREFER HIM HE COULD NOT QUITE SEE HARRY WITH FLORENCE'S EYES NOR COULD HE SEE HIMSELF WITH ANY OTHER EYES BUT HIS OWN
THEN I THINK THE WORLD WILL BE A LITTLE HARD UPON THE IMMACULATE HARRY ANNESLEY HIS OWN UNCLE HAS QUARRELLED WITH HIM ALREADY WHAT UNCLE THE GENTLEMAN DOWN IN HERTFORDSHIRE ON THE STRENGTH OF WHOSE ACRES MASTER HARRY IS FLAUNTING IT ABOUT IN IDLENESS
THAT I AM EVEN WITH HIM BEFORE ALL IS OVER I SHALL TRY IT ON WITH HIM SIR
SO HE BOLDLY WROTE DOWN HIS NAME FOR BOTH I ALMOST THINK THAT FLORENCE MUST HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HARRY ANNESLEY WAS TO BE THERE THAT NIGHT OR WHY SHOULD THE TWO PLACES HAVE BEEN KEPT VACANT AND NOW WHAT IS THIS HE BEGAN ABOUT YOUR GOING TO BRUSSELS
OH FLORENCE WILL YOU ANSWER ME A QUESTION ONE QUESTION I ASKED IT YOU BEFORE AND YOU DID NOT VOUCHSAFE ME ANY ANSWER YOU ASKED ME NO QUESTION SAID FLORENCE WHO REMEMBERED TO THE LAST SYLLABLE EVERY WORD THAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HER ON THAT OCCASION
GENEROUS TRUSTING AND PURE THESE MAY BE REGARDED AS FEMININE VIRTUES AND MAY BE SAID TO BE SOMETIMES TARNISHED BY FAULTS WHICH ARE EQUALLY FEMININE UNSELFISHNESS MAY BECOME WANT OF CHARACTER GENEROSITY ESSENTIALLY UNJUST
BUT SHE FELT IT AND WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT TIDINGS OF HIS DEBTS AT LAST REACHED HER SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS GLAD OF AN EXCUSE THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT THE EXCUSE WOULD NOT HAVE PREVAILED WITH HER HAD SHE LIKED HIM THEN CAME HIS DEBTS
AND I WILL MAKE HER SEW ON THE BUTTONS FOR HERSELF TELL MINNA I WILL LEND HER THAT BOOK I SPOKE OF ABOUT THOSE BOOTS I WILL GO WITH GEORGINA TO THE BOOT MAKER BUT AS TO AMELIA AND SOPHY SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SAY A GOOD NATURED WORD
I WON'T BE HALF A MOMENT SAID THE REPENTANT FATHER HASTENING UP STAIRS TO GO THROUGH HIS ORDINARY DRESSING ARRANGEMENT I WOULDN'T HURRY FOR HER SAID DOLLY BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL HURRY YOU ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU PAPA THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER
NOTHING WILL EVER KEEP HIM BACK WHEN CONVIVIALITY DEMANDS HIS PRESENCE THIS CAME FROM HIS AFFLICTED WIFE WHO IN SPITE OF ALL HIS MISFORTUNES WOULD EVER SPEAK WITH SOME RESPECT OF HER HUSBAND'S EMPLOYMENTS
HAS HE NOW AND I DON'T MEAN TO SPARE HIM I SHOULD THINK NOT THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AT THE END OF WHICH JONES FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN TO ASK A QUESTION HOW HAS HE LIED
WHAT HAD FOLLOWED HAS BEEN TOLD ALREADY PERHAPS TOO OFTEN BUT AT THIS MOMENT AS HE STOOD IN THE GLOOM OF THE NIGHT BELOW THE PORCH IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
HE'S A PESTILENTIAL CUR THAT HAS GOT HIMSELF INTRODUCED INTO THE FAMILY AND THE SOONER WE GET QUIT OF HIM THE BETTER I SHOULD THINK THE YOUNG LADY WOULD HARDLY FANCY HIM WHEN SHE KNOWS THAT HE HAS LIED LIKE THE VERY DEVIL WITH THE OBJECT OF GETTING HER FORMER LOVER OUT OF THE WAY
IN WHICH ONE GLASS WAS LEFT AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN WITH THE DOCUMENT IN HIS HAND JUST THE SAME FELLOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF OVERBEARING RECKLESS PIG HEADED AND A BULLY HE'D LOSE THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF HE HAD IT BUT THEN HE DON'T PAY
IN COMPANY WITH THE GREEN TROUSERS SHE HAD HER OWN MEANS OF OBTAINING INFORMATION AS TO THE CARROLL FAMILY IT WAS VERY NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO IF THE FAMILY WAS TO BE KEPT ON ITS LEGS AT ALL
OF THE HUE MOST COMMON TO MEN AND WOMEN AND HAD IN THEM NOTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR BUT HER HAIR WAS SOFT AND SMOOTH AND EVER WELL DRESSED AND NEVER REDOLENT OF PECULIAR ODORS IT WAS SIMPLY FLORENCE MOUNTJOY'S HAIR
MONACO ISN'T BAD THOUGH THERE IS OF COURSE THE PULL WHICH THE TABLES HAVE AGAINST YOU BUT IT'S A GRAND THING TO THINK THAT SKILL CAN BE OF NO AVAIL
THOUGH THERE IS SO MUCH THAT YOU MUST HAVE TO SAY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK YOU MUST TELL ME OH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL ME
THAT HE HAD A WIFE AT HOME WHOM HE KEPT IN MODERATE COMFORT ON HIS WINNINGS IT SEEMED TO BE THE SOLE DESIRE OF HIS HEART TO PLAY WITH RECKLESS FOOLISH YOUNG MEN WHO UP TO A CERTAIN POINT DID NOT CARE WHAT THEY LOST
ASKED FOR BARLEY WATER AS THERE WAS NONE HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIPPING APOLLINARIS A CLOSE RECORD OF THE EVENTS OF THAT EVENING WOULD MAKE BUT A TEDIOUS TALE FOR READERS MOUNTJOY OF COURSE LOST HIS FIFTY POUNDS ALAS
THOUGHT FLORENCE THERE WAS HER MOTHER STILL LOOKING AT THEM BUT FOR HER HARRY DID NOT NOW CARE ONE STRAW NOR DID HE HATE THOSE BRIGHT ITALIAN LAKES WITH NEARLY SO STRONG A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE FLORENCE YOU ARE NOW ALL MY OWN
ALL THIS HAD BEEN SAID APART WHILE A FAIR HAIRED LACKADAISICAL YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS STANDING TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS WAITING TO DANCE WITH FLORENCE
THAT'LL BE HARD ON SCARBOROUGH I'LL GO ON FOR MONEY SAID THE IMMOVABLE MAJOR I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T HAVE IT OUT WITH ME AT DOUBLE DUMMY SAID VIGNOLLES TO HIS VICTIM BUT DOUBLE DUMMY IS A TERRIBLE GRIND AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT
WELL GIRLS WHAT IS YOUR NEWS WE WERE OUT TO DAY ON THE BROMPTON ROAD SAID THE ELDEST AND THERE CAME UP PRINCE CHITAKOV'S DRAG WITH FOUR ROANS PRINCE CHITAKOV I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A PRINCE
HE SAID ONE WORD WHAT COULD HE WANT WITH A WORD MORE THOUGHT FLORENCE HER SILENCE NOW WAS AS GOOD AS ANY SPEECH
WHO PLAYED HIS CARDS WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND NEVER SPOKE A WORD EITHER THEN OR AT ANY OTHER PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HE WAS THE MOST TACITURN OF MEN AND WAS KNOWN NOT AT ALL TO ANY OF HIS COMPANIONS IT WAS RUMORED OF HIM
SO DEEP IN HER HEART HAD SUNK THAT SIN OF WHICH THEY HAD BEEN GUILTY WITH REFERENCE TO PRINCE CHITAKOV ON THAT NIGHT SHE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION WITH HER FATHER RESPECTING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SCARBOROUGH FAMILY THE DISCUSSION WAS HELD IN THE DINING ROOM AND MAY THEREFORE
I TRUST YOU WHAT IS IT YOU DESIRE OF ME THE SAINTLY CONFIDENCE OF THE OLD MAN AND THE NOBILITY OF MIND IMPRINTED ON HIS COUNTENANCE MIGHT HAVE DISARMED EVEN AN ASSASSIN HE WHO THUS MYSTERIOUSLY AGITATED THIS HOME OF PENURY AND RESIGNATION
YOU SAID YOU SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CATHERINE READILY AGREED
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENTS BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
SO IMPATIENTLY AWAITED CAME AT LENGTH AT MIDNIGHT THE HEAVY STEPS RESOUNDED UP THE WOODEN STAIRWAY THE ROOM WAS PREPARED FOR THE SERVICE THE ALTAR WAS DRESSED THIS TIME THE SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND HASTENED TO LIGHT THE ENTRANCE
KNOWING AS SHE DID THAT BOTH THE MISTER KNIGHTLEYS WERE AS UNPERSUADABLE ON THAT ARTICLE AS HERSELF AND TWO BASINS ONLY WERE ORDERED AFTER A LITTLE MORE DISCOURSE IN PRAISE OF GRUEL WITH SOME WONDERING AT ITS NOT BEING TAKEN EVERY EVENING BY EVERYBODY
BUT MONSIEUR WE HAVE NO PRIEST HERE CRIED SISTER MARTHA HASTILY AND THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE BETTER PRECAUTIONS SAID THE UNKNOWN GENTLY STRETCHING HIS ARM TO THE TABLE AND PICKING UP A BREVIARY I DO NOT THINK YOU UNDERSTAND LATIN
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THE SERVANT HAVING NOW SCAMPERED UP THE GENTLEMEN JUMPED OUT
HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO O LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER QUESTION
DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS I HAVE LEARNED YOUR POVERTY AND YOUR GREAT DEVOTION TO THE VENERABLE ABBE OF HUSH EXCLAIMED SISTER AGATHA INGENUOUSLY PUTTING A FINGER ON HER LIP YOU SEE MY SISTERS
HE WAS SCARCELY HIDDEN WHEN THREE KNOCKS UPON THE DOOR MADE THE SISTERS TREMBLE AND CONSULT EACH OTHER WITH THEIR EYES FOR THEY DARED NOT SPEAK FORTY YEARS SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD HAD MADE THEM LIKE PLANTS OF A HOT HOUSE WHICH WILT WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE OUTER AIR
PERHAPS HE FEARED AN IMPENDING CRIME IN WHICH HE WOULD BE CALLED TO TAKE AN UNWILLING PART WHEN THE SERVICE WAS OVER THE PRIEST MADE A SIGN TO THE NUNS
HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TO DAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED
AND THE MARQUIS DE BEAUSEANT ADVISING THEM AS TO THE MEASURES THEY MUST TAKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS DREADFUL COUNTRY AND SAVE YOU FROM THE MISERY OR THE DEATH YOU WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO HERE SHALL YOU NOT FOLLOW US
I AM SORRY TO FIND MY LOVE THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT THINK YOU LOOKING WELL BUT I HOPE IT IS ONLY FROM BEING A LITTLE FATIGUED I COULD HAVE WISHED HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD SEEN MISTER WINGFIELD BEFORE YOU LEFT HOME
UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
SHE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND SAW A HUMAN FORM LOOMING THROUGH THE FOG THE INDISTINCT GLIMPSE WAS ENOUGH SHE STAGGERED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF TERROR
UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT
FOR IN DEFAULT OF OTHER MEANS OF PROCLAIMING THE OBJECT OF THIS FUNERAL RITE THE PRIEST HAD PUT GOD HIMSELF INTO MOURNING THE MYSTERIOUS VISITANT WAS SEIZED BY SOME ALL POWERFUL RECOLLECTION AND DROPS OF SWEAT GATHERED ON HIS BROW
AND DISAPPEARED WITH PHANTASMAGORIC RAPIDITY THE MAN STANDING MOTIONLESS GAZED AT THE HOUSE WHICH WAS AS IT WERE A TYPE OF THE WRETCHED BUILDINGS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE TOTTERING HOVEL BUILT OF POROUS STONE IN ROUGH BLOCKS
I HAVE NOT COME AS AN ENEMY CITOYENNES THEN HE PAUSED BUT RESUMED MY SISTERS IF HARM SHOULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BE SURE THAT I SHALL NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT I HAVE COME TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU THEY STILL KEPT SILENCE
AND MISTER WINGFIELD SAYS IT IS ENTIRELY A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THE PLACE UNHEALTHY AND I AM SURE HE MAY BE DEPENDED ON FOR HE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE AIR AND HIS OWN BROTHER AND FAMILY HAVE BEEN THERE REPEATEDLY YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CROMER MY DEAR IF YOU WENT ANYWHERE
SHE CAME RAPIDLY FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND WENT TOWARDS THE BACK SHOP TO CALL HER HUSBAND WHO APPEARED AT ONCE WHERE HAVE YOU PUT SHE ASKED HIM MYSTERIOUSLY CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO THE OLD LADY BY A GLANCE AND NOT CONCLUDING HER SENTENCE
BENEATH THESE RAFTERS AND DISJOINTED LATHS FOUR CHRISTIAN SOULS WERE INTERCEDING WITH GOD FOR A KING OF FRANCE AND MAKING HIS BURIAL WITHOUT A COFFIN IT WAS THE PUREST OF ALL DEVOTIONS
HE HEARD THE MASS AND PRAYED BUT IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
EXCLAIMED THE OTHER NUN HASTILY OPENING A HIDING PLACE BURROWED AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF THIS TIME IT WAS EASY TO HEAR THE STEPS OF A MAN SOUNDING THROUGH THE DEEP SILENCE ON THE ROUGH STAIRS WHICH WERE CAKED WITH PATCHES OF HARDENED MUD
THE SHOPKEEPER AND HIS WIFE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A GLANCE AT THE OLD LADY THAT CONVEYED A MUTUAL THOUGHT THE LOUIS WAS DOUBTLESS HER LAST THE HANDS OF THE POOR WOMAN TREMBLED AS SHE OFFERED IT AND HER EYES RESTED UPON IT SADLY YET NOT WITH AVARICE
EMMA'S ATTEMPTS TO STOP HER FATHER HAD BEEN VAIN AND WHEN HE HAD REACHED SUCH A POINT AS THIS SHE COULD NOT WONDER AT HER BROTHER IN LAW'S BREAKING OUT MISTER PERRY SAID HE IN A VOICE OF VERY STRONG DISPLEASURE WOULD DO AS WELL TO KEEP HIS OPINION TILL IT IS ASKED FOR
WHO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM THE MASSACRE AT THE CONVENT OF THE CARMELITES HOSANNA SAID SISTER AGATHA SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING THE STRANGER AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH ANXIOUS CURIOSITY THAT IS NOT HIS NAME I THINK HE ANSWERED
ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM SEEMED FEARFUL OF BEING TOO HANDSOME UNLESS HE WORE THE DRESS OF A GROOM AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN
AND THE FEELING THAT HELD THESE FOUR SERVANTS OF GOD AND THE KING WAS UNANIMOUS THE SACRED WORDS ECHOED LIKE CELESTIAL MUSIC AMID THE SILENCE THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE UNKNOWN BROKE DOWN AND WEPT IT WAS AT THE PATER NOSTER
RETURN HERE AT MIDNIGHT AND I SHALL BE READY TO CELEBRATE THE ONLY FUNERAL SERVICE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER IN EXPIATION OF THE CRIME OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THE UNKNOWN SHIVERED A JOY BOTH SWEET AND SOLEMN SEEMED TO RISE IN HIS SOUL ABOVE SOME SECRET GRIEF
THE ECCLESIASTIC LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE STRANGER UNEQUIVOCAL ANXIETY WAS MARKED ON EVERY FEATURE AND HIS EYES OFFERED AN EARNEST AND EVEN ARDENT PRAYER YES SAID THE PRIEST AT LENGTH
THAT THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
THE FIRST VISIT OF THE OLD PRIEST WAS TO A PERFUMERY AT THE SIGN OF THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS
TO WHICH THE PRIEST ADDED A LATIN CLAUSE WHICH THE STRANGER DOUBTLESS COMPREHENDED AND APPLIED
MISTER WOODHOUSE AGREED TO IT ALL BUT ADDED OUR LITTLE FRIEND HARRIET SMITH HOWEVER IS JUST SUCH ANOTHER PRETTY KIND OF YOUNG PERSON YOU WILL LIKE HARRIET EMMA COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER COMPANION THAN HARRIET
I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INQUIRY AFTER THEM
ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS THIS EVIL HAD BEEN FELT AND LAMENTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES A DAY BY ISABELLA SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN BATH AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE
WHY DOES HE MAKE IT ANY BUSINESS OF HIS TO WONDER AT WHAT I DO AT MY TAKING MY FAMILY TO ONE PART OF THE COAST OR ANOTHER I MAY BE ALLOWED I HOPE THE USE OF MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MISTER PERRY I WANT HIS DIRECTIONS NO MORE THAN HIS DRUGS HE PAUSED
THEY RESOLVED THAT THE STRANGER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR GRATITUDE
IN SPITE OF THE FAMINE WHICH THEN AFFLICTED PARIS THEY FOUND DAILY AT THE DOOR OF THEIR HOVEL RATIONS OF WHITE BREAD LAID THERE BY INVISIBLE HANDS
TO THESE INGENUOUS SOULS THE MYSTERY THAT WRAPPED THEIR UNKNOWN VISITOR BECAME INEXPLICABLE AND THE PRIEST FROM THAT DAY FORTH FORBADE HIMSELF TO SEARCH FOR ITS SOLUTION
WELL I WILL JUST SAY TWO WORDS TO THE MAN AND GET RID OF HIM HE SAID OPENING THE DOOR AND HURRYING OUT THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN PASSIVE AS A CHILD AND HALF PARALYZED WITH FEAR SAT DOWN AGAIN
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEIR THOUGHT HAD EVOKED FROM THE DEAD THE SACRED MARTYR WHOSE BODY WAS DEVOURED BY QUICKLIME BUT WHOSE SHADE ROSE UP BEFORE THEM IN ROYAL MAJESTY THEY WERE CELEBRATING A FUNERAL MASS WITHOUT THE REMAINS OF THE DECEASED
SNOW HAD FALLEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO THAT FOOTFALLS COULD BE SCARCELY HEARD THE STREETS WERE DESERTED
TWO HOURS LATER THE STRANGER RETURNED KNOCKED CAUTIOUSLY AT THE DOOR OF THE GARRET
HAS SHE BEEN HERE LONG HE ASKED EAGERLY NO ONLY A FEW DAYS OH WHEN I FIRST SAW HER I WAS STRUCK BY HER RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS ROGERS CONTINUED THE GIRL
THEY READ HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS
WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
LEFT THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND INDIGNANTLY RETURNED TO ELMHURST THIS MAN HOPKINS SAID MISTER WATSON ANGRILY IS NOT A GENTLEMAN HE'S AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER HE RUINED ANY GOOD EFFECT MY SPEECH MIGHT HAVE CREATED SAID KENNETH GLOOMILY
THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MISTER HOPKINS MISTER HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS
AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT
THEY NEEDED MORE SCHOOL HOUSES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH HE HOPED TO PROVIDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE DURING THIS ORATION BETH HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AT THE HOUSE AND HER SHARP EYES DETECTED THE MAID ELIZA
PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THESE THINGS SO LONG THAT THE MANUFACTURERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN COVERING EVERY BARN ROCK AND FENCE WITH THEIR SIGNS I SEE NO WAY TO STOP THEM NOR I AT PRESENT BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY
HOW HE HAD REDEEMED THE GLEN FROM ITS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION AND RESTORED IT TO ITS FORMER BEAUTY HE ASKED THEM TO OBSERVE WEBB'S PRETTY HOMESTEAD NO LONGER MARRED BY THE UNSIGHTLY SIGN UPON THE BARN AND THEN
INDEED SOME WERE PROUD OF THEM AND BELIEVED IT A MARK OF DISTINCTION TO HAVE THEIR FENCES AND SHEDS ANNOUNCE AN EYE REMEDY OR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PICKLES MISTER WATSON AT FIRST AN AMUSED OBSERVER OF THE CAMPAIGN SOON BECAME INDIGNANT AT THE WAY THAT KENNETH WAS RIDICULED AND REVILED
VENTURED TO RISK DEFEAT THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS WELL KNEW THIS FEELING AND SMILED IN HIS POMPOUS AND MOST SARDONIC MANNER WHEN HE LEARNED WHO WAS HIS OPPONENT
THAT FEELING WILL PROBABLY ELECT MISTER HOPKINS DECLARED KENNETH WITH CONVICTION UNLESS UNLESS WHAT SIR UNLESS WE COME TO THE RESCUE OF THE REPUBLICANS AND TAKE A HAND IN LOCAL POLITICS OURSELVES MY LAD
HE APPEALED TO THEM TO HELP HIM IN DRIVING ALL THE ADVERTISING SIGNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN HE ENDED THEY APPLAUDED HIS SPEECH MILDLY BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SO FORCIBLY AND WELL THEN
THEN YOU MUST SHOW IT BY BEING A MAN AND NOT BY GIVING WAY TO YOUR TROUBLE IN THIS FOOLISH MANNER I'LL TRY SIR NOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR THERE'S A GOOD DEAL TO HOPE FOR DESPAIR WON'T HELP YOU YOU MUST GO TO WORK
IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG
CHAPTER FOUR KENNETH TAKES A BOLD STEP THIS MAN HOPKINS GETS ON MY NERVES SAID MISTER WATSON A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE EVENTFUL MEETING IN THE SCHOOL HOUSE
WHICH PAINTED SIGNS WHEREVER IT COULD SECURE SPACE THESE SIGNS WERE NOT WORKS OF ART BUT THEY WERE DISTINCTLY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS AND ONLY A FOOL IN THE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WOULD PROTEST AGAINST THE INEVITABLE WHAT BROUGHT THE LEGISLATOR TO THE MEETING
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM W P L AND THE WORDS
THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DISTRICT LENT HIS PRESENCE TO THE ASSEMBLAGE NOT THAT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS CARED A FIG ABOUT THIS FOOLISH TALK OF EXTERMINATING ADVERTISING SIGNS HE WAS HIMSELF A LARGE STOCKHOLDER IN A BREAKFAST FOOD FACTORY
DO MUCH TO DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTER AND RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF YOUR EXISTENCE KENNETH FROWNED
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
AND MEET MISTER HOPKINS IN THE LANE THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM THE NEXT DAY MISTER HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT
WHEN AT LAST HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HE FOUND THE SUN SINKING IN THE WEST AND FEARED HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF INDISCRETION HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS MISTER FORBES'S SECRETARY NOW AND THAT MISTER FORBES MIGHT WANT HIM
SHE WAS SUCH A GENTLE SHRINKING GIRL AS SHY AND RETIRING AS A CHILD AND SHE NEVER DID A THING THAT WOULD CAUSE ANYONE THE LEAST WORRY OR UNHAPPINESS BUT SHE WAS OUT OF HER HEAD SIR AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT THAT WAS THE REASON SHE WENT AWAY
AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
WHEN MISTER FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
YES OF COURSE BUT IT WASN'T SO BAD MISSUS ROGERS IT WASN'T A DESPERATE CONDITION BY ANY MEANS WITH POOR TOM IN PRISON FOR YEARS AND JUST FOR TRYING TO HELP HER TOM ISN'T IN PRISON YOU KNOW ANY MORE SAID BETH QUIETLY
KENNETH FLUSHED RED HE WAS BY NATURE SHY AND RETIRING TO A DEGREE ONLY HIS PENT UP ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND NOW THAT IT WAS OVER HE WAS CHAGRINED TO THINK THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE
I THOUGHT IT BEST TO WEAR OUT THE REMAINDER OF MY EXISTENCE IN THE SECLUSION OF A FARM HOUSE I PUT ALL THE PAST BEHIND ME AND TOLD WILL ROGERS I WOULD MARRY HIM AND BE A FAITHFUL WIFE BUT THAT MY HEART WAS DEAD HE ACCEPTED ME ON THAT CONDITION
WHY BECAUSE HOPKINS IS A DEMOCRAT AND WE MAY THEN FIGHT HIM OPENLY
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER COMPETING SIGNS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE KENNETH PROMPTLY MAILED A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT DEMANDED AND EARLY NEXT MORNING STARTED FOR THE GLEN WITH WHAT HE CALLED HIS ELIMINATORS THESE ELIMINATORS CONSISTED OF TWO MEN WITH CANS OF TURPENTINE
THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MISTER HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS
BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DETECTIVE THAT CAME TO SEE MISSUS ROGERS SAID TOM MUSINGLY SHE TOLD ME A STRANGE MAN HAD BEEN THERE FROM MISTER FORBES TO INQUIRE ALL ABOUT LUCY
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PICTURE SAID KENNETH AND YOU MUSTN'T THINK OF HER AS DEAD MISSUS ROGERS SAID BETH PLEADINGLY I'M SURE SHE IS ALIVE AND THAT WE SHALL FIND HER WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO WORK AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SHALL BE DONE TO TRACE YOUR DAUGHTER
HE WANTED THE YOUNG MAN TO ROUSE HIMSELF AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN LIFE AND IF HIS ANTAGONISM TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WOULD EFFECT THIS
THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
THEN SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT LEAVING A WORD OR MESSAGE FOR US WHICH WAS UNLIKE HER AND WE'VE NEVER HEARD A WORD OF HER SINCE THE THE RIVER HAS A STRANGE FASCINATION FOR PEOPLE IN THAT CONDITION AT TIMES IN MY LIFE
I HAVE HAD TO BEAR SO MUCH IN MY LIFE THAT I COULD EVEN BEAR MY CHILD'S DEATH BUT TO HAVE HER DISAPPEAR AND NOT KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER WHETHER SHE IS LIVING MISERABLY OR LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER
STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
I HAVEN'T SLEPT A WINK SINCE I HEARD THE AWFUL NEWS OF HER SICKNESS AND ESCAPE WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE CAN BE SIR HIS QUESTION WAS FULL OF AGONIZED ENTREATY AND HIS MANNER PITIFULLY APPEALING I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED KENNETH
THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS TO REPORT OUR MOVEMENTS TO MISTER HOPKINS AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM IN THAT SO THE MATTER WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME AND AS IF TO VERIFY BETH'S SUSPICIONS ELIZA WAS SEEN TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS AFTER DUSK
AND THAT HER CHILDHOOD WITH ITS SQUALORS AND MISERIES WAS BLOTTED OUT ATONED FOR BY THIS LAST KIND SUDDEN STROKE OF FATE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELAYED SO DEPLORABLY
AN SETTIN HIS FATHER AGAINST ANY OF EM AS DIDN'T GIVE IN TO HIM
BRINGING OUT THE OBSTINATE MOUTH AND THE WHITE HAND HOLDING A JEWELLED GLOVE
BUT HE CAUGHT ME LOOKIN AT A SNARE THIS MORNIN' IT WOR MISTY AND I DIDN'T SEE NO ONE COMIN IT WOR CLOSE TO THE FOOTPATH AND IT WORN'T MY SNARE JIM MY CHAP SAYS HE MOCKIN I'M SORRY FOR IT BUT I'M GOING TO SEARCH YER
PLEASE REMEMBER IT ANTHONY LOOKED AT HER AN INSTANT IN SILENCE A QUESTION CROSSED HIS MIND CONCERNING HER
WOULD GO THE MUSIC STOOL AND THE CHILD LEAPT TO THE WINDOW REMAINING FIXED THERE
FOR THEY WERE ALWAYS WELL THUMBED BEFORE THEY CAME BACK TO HER BUT TO NIGHT HIS SULLEN WEARINESS WOULD MAKE NO EFFORT AND THE HUNTED RESTLESS GLANCES HE THREW FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS HE SAT CROUCHING OVER THE FIRE THE LARGE MOUTH TIGHT SHUT
FANCIED SLUR SHE WAS NO LONGER EVEN THE HALF
ALL WELL SAID MARCELLA IN A HALF WHISPER AS SHE PASSED LOUIS CRAVEN ON HER WAY TO GET SOME CAKE HE NODDED AND SMILED AND SHE WENT BACK TO THE TEA TABLE WITH AN EYE ALL GAIETY PLEASED WITH HERSELF AND EVERYBODY ELSE
FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING EMPLOYMENT BUT THEIR OWN MEN ON THE ESTATE WOULD COME FIRST AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM OUT OF WORK WELL BUT THERE IS THE GAME PERSISTED MARCELLA
THEIR HOSTESS AND EDITH CRAVEN HAD ESCAPED THROUGH THE DOOR IN THE BACK KITCHEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE HURDS TENEMENT SO THAT THE TWO MEN MIGHT BE LEFT ALONE A WHILE THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THEM HAD GONE SMOOTHLY
MEANWHILE IN THE LANE OUTSIDE MARCELLA AS SHE WALKED HOME PASSED A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED MAN IN A VELVETEEN SUIT AND GAITERS HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TWO DOGS BEHIND HIM
WHO IN CONTRAST TO EVERY OTHER GIRL IN THE SCHOOL HAD NOT A SINGLE PARTY FROCK
AND HAD OFFERED TWO HUNDRED A YEAR SO FAR AS THAT WENT CRAVEN WAS ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED AND I UNDERSTAND FROM YOU HE SAID THAT THE PAPER GOES IN FOR THE STRIKE THAT YOU WILL FIGHT IT THROUGH
SHE HAD BEEN AN AVERAGE CHILD OF THE QUICK AND CLEVER TYPE
THE WHOLE FAMILY GATHERED ROUND WATCHING FOR THE MOMENT OF EATING THE FIRE PLAYED ON THE THIN LEGS AND PINCHED FACES OF THE CHILDREN ON THE BABY'S CRADLE IN THE FURTHER CORNER ON THE MOTHER RED EYED STILL BUT ABLE TO SMILE AND TALK AGAIN
BUT THE SCENES AND PASSAGES
CAN'T YOU AS JIM DON'T WANT TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WESTALL THANK YOU KINDLY ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED BREAKING OFF HER NARRATIVE WITH THE SAME UNCERTAINTY OF MANNER THE SAME TIMID SCRUTINY OF HER VISITOR THAT MARCELLA HAD NOTICED BEFORE
NOW AT TWENTY ONE
THE DEPENDENT OF THAT CHARLATAN I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M TO PUT UP WITH IT YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT I THINK OF HIM AND OF YOUR BECOMING DEPENDENT ON HIM MARCELLA GAVE AN ANGRY START LOUIS PROTESTED NONSENSE
COVETOUS EAGERNESS IT WAS BUT THREE MONTHS OR SO SINCE MARCELLA'S FATHER MISTER RICHARD BOYCE HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF MELLOR PARK
SO SHE SUBMITTED AND PRESENTLY LEARNT UNDER DIRE STRESS OF BOREDOM TO AMUSE HERSELF A GOOD DEAL BY DEVELOPING A NATURAL CAPACITY FOR DREAMING AWAKE
A HUNTER AND SPORTSMAN MUST HAVE RESISTED SUCCESSFULLY A SCORE OF TIMES BEFORE
NOW COUNTED TIME ENTIRELY BY SUNDAYS TO SEE THE
ABOUT WHAT MISTER HARRY WHARTON SPENDS ON HIS CLOTHES I SHOULD THINK THE LABOUR MEN TELL ME HE IS SUPERB IN THAT LINE AND FOR THE SAME SUM THAT HE SPENDS ON HIS CLOTHES HE IS ABLE TO BUY YOU LOUIS BODY AND SOUL
THE DELIGHTFUL ROUNDNESS OF QUIET MASS AND SHADE AND THERE
WHARTON WHOSE TENDENCY IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS WAS ALWAYS TO GO RATHER FURTHER THAN HE HAD MEANT TO GO FOR THE SAKE GENERALLY OF MAKING AN IMPRESSION ON THE MAN WITH WHOM HE WAS DEALING HAD SPOKEN OF A TWO YEARS ENGAGEMENT
HE BE MISS
THE SIZE OF THE TREES THE WIDE UPLANDS OF THE FALLING VALLEY TO THE LEFT OF THE AVENUE
NATURALLY ANTHONY AND I DREW OUR CONCLUSIONS MARCELLA LAUGHED YOU MUST BRING HER TO SEE ME SHE SAID TO LOUIS I WILL SAID LOUIS WITH SOME PERPLEXITY IF I CAN GET HOLD OF HER
SHE SAW SOMETHING WHITE LYING ON THE OLD CUT AND DISUSED BILLIARD TABLE WHICH STILL OCCUPIED THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR TILL RICHARD BOYCE IN THE COURSE OF HIS ECONOMIES AND IMPROVEMENTS COULD REPLACE IT BY A NEW ONE SHE RAN FORWARD AND TOOK UP A SHEAF OF CARDS
TO CHOOSE NEXT MORNING BETWEEN ANOTHER DUMB DAY OF SENNA TEA AND GRUEL
OF TWO OR THREE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS THEIR TRADESMEN PAPAS WERE SOMETIMES READY TO DEAL ON FAVOURABLE TERMS WITH MISS FREDERICK
MISS ANNA FOUND HER SHOES OUTSIDE HER DOOR BLACKED AS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BLACKED BEFORE WITH A NOTE INSIDE ONE OF THEM AFFECTING WASN'T IT THENCEFORWARD AS LONG AS THEY REMAINED IN THOSE LODGINGS ANNA MENDED AND LOUIS BLACKED
THE LAME ELDER BROTHER WHO MUST HAVE PASSED HIM ON THE STAIRS APPEARED WELL ANY NEWS HE SAID AS MARCELLA FOUND HIM A CHAIR ALL RIGHT SAID LOUIS WHOSE MANNER HAD ENTIRELY CHANGED SINCE WHARTON HAD LEFT THE ROOM
I MIGHT GO AND INQUIRE OF WESTALL I KNOW HIM A LITTLE THE WIFE MADE A STARTLED MOVEMENT AND HURD RAISED HIS MISSHAPEN FORM WITH A JERK THANK YER MISS BUT I'LL NOT TROUBLE YER I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH WESTALL
MISSUS HURD SAID WONDERING
HE FIXED HIS PENETRATING GREENISH EYES ON HIS COMPANION LOUIS CRAVEN WAS NOW A TALL MAN WITH NARROW SHOULDERS A FINE OVAL HEAD AND FACE DELICATE FEATURES AND A NERVOUS LOOK OF SHORT SIGHT
AND IF I WERE YOU MARCELLA I WOULD HARDLY DISCUSS THE FAMILY AFFAIRS ANY MORE WITH MISTER RAEBURN OR ANYBODY ELSE AND AGAIN HER KEEN GLANCE DISCONCERTED THE TALL HANDSOME GIRL WHOSE POWER OVER THE WORLD ABOUT HER HAD NEVER EXTENDED TO HER MOTHER
AND SHE KEPT TWISTING HER APRON IN HER GNARLED HANDS YES I SHALL
THREE DAYS PASSED ON THE FOURTH MARCELLA RETURNED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FROM A ROUND OF PARISH VISITS WITH MARY HARDEN AS SHE OPENED THE OAK DOORS WHICH SHUT OFF THE CENTRAL HALL OF MELLOR FROM THE OUTER VESTIBULE
ENDING AT LAST IN A FAR DISTANT GAP WHERE A GATE AND A GATE OF SOME IMPORTANCE CLEARLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WHAT SHE SAID BREATHLESSLY NOTHINK HE LAUGHED OUT NARY AN END O STRING NOR A KINK O WIRE NOTHINK
CRAVEN LOOKED UP ABSENTLY AND I THINK HE SAID YOU GAVE ME MISTER THORPE'S ADDRESS MISTER THORPE WAS THE SECRETARY AGAIN WHARTON GULPED DOWN HIS ANNOYANCE
AND PROPPING HER FACE UPON HER HANDS DEVOURED THE SCENE
THE FROWN DISAPPEARED AGAIN IN THE FORMER LOOK OF GLOWING CONTENT THAT CONTENT OF YOUTH WHICH IS NEVER MERELY PASSIVE NAY RATHER CONTAINS AN INVARIABLE ELEMENT OF
AND AS SHE LOOKED
HAVE TAKEN NO INTEREST IN SUCH THINGS AT ALL BUT WHATEVER HAD BEEN SPOKEN BY HIM HAD GRACE
SOMETHING GENERALLY INTERPOSED
SO I UNDERSTAND YOU WISH ME TO GO DOWN AT ONCE SAID LOUIS CRAVEN THIS IS FRIDAY SAY MONDAY WHARTON NODDED HE AND CRAVEN WERE SITTING IN MARCELLA'S LITTLE SITTING ROOM
FIGURING GENERALLY AS THE
PROMISED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE DEGREE OF INTEREST AND NOVELTY YET
HE STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD STRAINING HIS EYES TO SEE THROUGH THE FIRE LIT GLOOM IT'S MISS BOYCE JIM SAID HIS WIFE DID YOU HEAR OF ANYTHINK THEY'RE TURNIN OFF HANDS INSTEAD OF TAKIN OV EM ON HE SAID BRIEFLY
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN AND TWO O'CLOCK JUDGING FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE CONSIDER THIS A VERY FAVOURABLE TIME FOR INSPIRATION AT ANY RATE IN THE CASE OF MISSUS DOBELL
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT CONVEY THAT SECRET TO THE READER IT IS HEAVY ABSTRACT AND PROSAIC AND SHOWS HOW INTOLERABLY DULL A MAN CAN BE WHO HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THE MOST EARNEST BELIEFS
PART OF IT LIKE ROUGH MATERIAL FOR POETRY AND PART OF IT LIKE MISSHAPEN PROSE IT IS AN INTERESTING SPECIMEN OF POETIC WRITING BUT IT IS NOT A PERFECT WORK OF ART
AND THE SOUL EMERGES FROM IT STRONGER AND MORE SELF CONTAINED TO HIM CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN A MODE OF PURIFICATION THE OPENING SONNETS
FOUR CHESS A CHRISTMAS MASQUE BY LOUIS TYLOR FISHER UNWIN FIVE POEMS OF NATURE AND LIFE BY DAVID R WILLIAMSON BLACKWOOD
SONGS OF ADIEU BY LORD HENRY SOMERSET CHATTO AND WINDUS NINE
IT CERTAINLY MUST BE ADMITTED THAT TO PATCH OR TO EXULT IN THE BASEST BLANK IS A FORM OF CONDUCT QUITE UNBEFITTING AN ARTIST THE VERY OBSCURITY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF SUCH A CRIME
IS POWERFUL NAKED I CAME INTO THE WORLD OF PLEASURE AND NAKED COME I TO THIS HOUSE OF PAIN HERE AT THE GATE
NOR DID HER SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE EVER WARP OR DULL THE TENDERNESS AND HUMANITY OF HER NATURE FOR BIRDS AND ANIMALS SHE HAD ALWAYS A GREAT LOVE WE HEAR OF HER AS A LITTLE GIRL WATCHING WITH EAGER EYES THE SWALLOWS AS THEY BUILT THEIR NESTS IN SUMMER
I STUDY POETRY SIMPLY AS A FINE ART BY WHICH I MAY EXERCISE MY INTELLECT AND ELEVATE MY TASTE WROTE THE LATE MISTER GEORGE MORINE MANY YEARS AGO TO A FRIEND
WHICH FOLLOWED THE CORONATION OF CHARLES THE FIFTH AT BOLOGNA AN ERA TO WHICH MISTER SYMONDS GIVES THE NAME OF THE CATHOLIC REACTION AND THEY CONTAIN A MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE ACCOUNT OF THE POSITION OF SPAIN IN THE ITALIAN PENINSULA
AS ANY OTHER FORM OF THEOLOGICAL THOUGHT HERE IS THE OPENING OF A POEM CALLED A STREET SERMON WHICH IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF WHAT MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY CAN DO IN THE SPHERE OF VERSE MAKING WHAT
BUT WE SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT PEOPLE OF ANY AGE COULD ADMIRE SUCH A PARAPHRASE AS THE FOLLOWING FOXES HAVE HOLES IN WHICH TO SLINK FOR REST THE BIRDS OF AIR FIND SHELTER IN THE NEST BUT HE THE SON OF MAN AND LORD OF ALL
THOUGH HE REALLY SHOULD NOT PUBLISH SUCH ATTEMPTS AT METRICAL VERSIONS OF THE PSALMS AS THE FOLLOWING A SEPTUAGENARIAN WE FREQUENTLY MAY SEE AN OCTOGENARIAN IF ONE SHOULD LIVE TO BE HE IS A BURDEN TO HIMSELF WITH WEARINESS AND WOE
THEIR SURPRISE AND PLEASURE WERE GREAT WHEN I EXPLAINED THE MATTER TO THEM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH THEY ALL FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN REALISING THAT THIS HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED ONE ASKED IF EGYPT EXISTED NOW AND IF PEOPLE LIVED IN IT
A MAZURKA OF CHOPIN IS CHARMING IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE FIFTH LINE AND SO ARE THE VERSES ON ASSISI AND THOSE ON SAN SERVOLO AT VENICE THESE LAST HAVE ALL THE BRILLIANCY OF A CLEVER PASTEL
AFAR IN THE DESERT AFAR IN THE DESERT I LOVE TO RIDE WITH THE SILENT BUSH BOY ALONE BY MY SIDE AWAY AWAY FROM THE DWELLING OF MEN BY THE WILD DEER'S HAUNT BY THE BUFFALO'S GLEN
AND TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE CURRANT JELLY AT A VERY CRITICAL MOMENT SHE OWED THE AFFECTION OF SOME OF HER HUSBAND'S RELATIVES WHO UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN RATHER PREJUDICED AGAINST HER ON THE GROUND THAT SHE WAS MERELY AN UNPRACTICAL BLUE STOCKING
BUT THE STORY SEEMS TO ME TO BE FAR TOO CHARMING TO REQUIRE ANY MORAL OF THE KIND BOUND UP IN THE SAME VOLUME IS A LIFE OF MISS MARY CARPENTER ALSO WRITTEN BY PHYLLIS BROWNE MISS CARPENTER DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO HAVE THE CHARM AND FASCINATION OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE
AND WHEN THUS THE FIGHT FALTERED AND MEN ONCE BOLD WITH FACES WHITE TURNED THIS AND THAT WAY IN EXCUSE TO FLEE I ONLY STOOD AND BY THE FOEMAN'S MIGHT
THE HABIT OF MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR THE OPINIONS FEELINGS OR PREJUDICES OF OTHERS AN ERECT CARRIAGE THAT IS A SOUND BODY A GOOD MEMORY FOR FACES AND FACTS CONNECTED WITH THEM THUS AVOIDING GIVING OFFENCE
HOW FEW OF ALL THEIR NUMBERS ARE LEFT THEM BY THE FOE NOT MUCH CAN BE SAID OF A POET WHO EXCLAIMS OH FOR THE POWER OF BYRON OR OF MOORE TO GLOW WITH ONE AND WITH THE LATTER SOAR
THEY NATURALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND MARRY AND FOR MANY YEARS DAVID WESTREN LEADS A PERFECTLY HAPPY LIFE SUDDENLY CALAMITY COMES UPON HIM
A HIDEOUS IDOL WHOSE FACE WAS BLACKENED WITH SOOT FROM BURNING HUMAN FLESH SUCH A SENTENCE ALSO AS
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT IS FORMAL LIMITED AND PRECISE WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD SHE INSISTED ON BEING CALLED DOCTOR CARPENTER IN THE NURSERY AT THE AGE OF TWELVE SHE IS DESCRIBED BY A FRIEND AS A SEDATE LITTLE GIRL WHO ALWAYS SPOKE LIKE A BOOK
WAS NOT ALWAYS SO BARBAROUS I HAD TAKEN TO MY CLASS ON THE PRECEDING WEEK SOME SPECIMENS OF FERNS NEATLY GUMMED ON WHITE PAPER THIS TIME I TOOK A PIECE OF COAL SHALE WITH IMPRESSIONS OF FERNS TO SHOW THEM
THE MOST AMBITIOUS POEM IN THE BOOK IS SOMEWHAT TOO ABSTRACT AND METAPHYSICAL AND SUCH LINES AS LIFT THEE O'ER THY HERE AND NOW LOOK BEYOND THINE I AND THOU
AND WE LEAVE HIM PREACHING PLATITUDES TO A VILLAGE CONGREGATION HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THIS COMMONPLACE CONCLUSION THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN MISTER HAYES'S POEM THAT IS STRONG AND FINE AND HE UNDOUBTEDLY POSSESSES A FAIR EAR FOR MUSIC
IS AWKWARD AND UNCOUTH AND YET THE POEM IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION OCCURS HAS SOME PRETTY LINES MISTER IAN HAMILTON SHOULD PRUNE PRUNING WHETHER IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE STUDY
AND THEIR INCORRIGIBLE LAZINESS THE SHREWD SHOPKEEPER WHO IMPORTS ARMS IN FLOUR BARRELS FOR THE USE OF THE MOONLIGHTERS AND AS SOON AS HE HAS GOT RID OF THEM GIVES INFORMATION OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS TO THE POLICE
NOR TOO ORDINARY A TYPE TO BE COMMON EXCELLENT ALSO IN ITS DIRECT SIMPLICITY OF RENDERING IS THE PICTURE OF MISS JULIET D'ARCY AND THE SCENE IN WHICH AT THE MOMENT OF HER DEATH THE OLD WOMAN'S MEMORY RETURNS TO HER IS QUITE ADMIRABLE
FROM THE SONNETS WE TAKE THIS AT RANDOM NOT SPRING TOO LAVISH OF HER BUD AND LEAF BUT AUTUMN WITH SAD EYES AND BROWS AUSTERE WHEN FIELDS ARE BARE
HAS BEEN WON BY MISS STORY THE DAUGHTER OF A NORTH OF IRELAND CLERGYMAN IT IS PLEASANT TO BE ABLE TO CHRONICLE AN ITEM OF IRISH NEWS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIOLENCE OF PARTY POLITICS OR PARTY FEELING AND THAT SHOWS HOW WORTHY WOMEN ARE OF THAT HIGHER CULTURE
SEEMS TO BE THAT AN ABSORBING PASSION IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING AND BLUNTS THE HUMAN SYMPATHIES IN THE COURSE OF THE CHASE A LITTLE CHILD IS DROWNED A BRAHMIN MAIDEN MURDERED AND AN AGED PEASANT SEVERELY WOUNDED
THIS IS THE GRAVE NAY HELL YET LORD OF MIGHT STILL IN THY LIGHT MY SPIRIT SHALL SEE LIGHT
THE WIND THAT THROUGH THE SILENT WOODLAND BLOWS O'ER RIPPLING CORN AND DREAMING PASTURES GOES STRAIGHT TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE HEART OF SPRING FAINTS IN THE HEART OF SUMMER'S EARLIEST ROSE
BIRMINGHAM CORNISH BROTHERS
JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THAT STRANGE PLAY ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHICH MISTER SWINBURNE SO MUCH ADMIRES INDEED IT MAY BE SAID TO POSSESS ALL THE FATAL ORIGINALITY OF INEXPERIENCE HOWEVER
SO WIDELY DIFFERENT AS TURNER AND RICHARD COBDEN HANDEL AND SIR TITUS SALT ROBERT STEPHENSON AND FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE AND YET POSSESSING A CERTAIN DEFINITE AIM AS A MATHEMATICIAN AND A SCIENTIST THE TRANSLATOR AND POPULARISER OF LA MECANIQUE CELESTE
AND THE BLACK KING'S BISHOP COMPLETES IT THE PAWNS SING IN CHORUS AND THE CASTLES CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER THE SILLINESS OF THE FORM MAKES IT AN ABSOLUTELY UNREADABLE BOOK MISTER WILLIAMSON'S POEMS OF NATURE AND LIFE
AND SOON HE DIES AND OFF HE FLIES AND LEAVETH ALL BELOW THE LITERARY CULTURE THAT PRODUCED THESE LINES IS WE FEAR NOT OF A VERY HIGH ORDER
UNATTACHED LADIES SUCH AS WIDOWS AND UNMARRIED WOMEN HAVE QUITE AMPLE WORK TO DO IN THE WORLD FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS TO ABSORB ALL THEIR POWERS WIVES AND MOTHERS HAVE A VERY NOBLE WORK GIVEN THEM BY GOD AND WANT NO MORE
REMINDS US THAT RHETORIC HAS NOT YET LOST ITS CHARMS FOR MISTER SYMONDS STILL ON THE WHOLE THE STYLE SHOWS FAR MORE RESERVE BALANCE AND SOBRIETY THAN CAN BE FOUND IN THE EARLIER VOLUMES WHERE VIOLENT ANTITHESIS FORMS THE PREDOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC
SINCE THERE ARE NO PORTIONS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE TO WHICH IT DOES NOT DREAM OF ASPIRING HOW SO SAID I HE WHO TO ESCAPE WANT SEEKS RICHES GIVES HIMSELF NO CONCERN ABOUT POWER
WHO CAN ACCOUNT HIM WHO POSSESSES GOOD TO BE WITHOUT REWARD AND WHAT A PRIZE THE FAIREST AND GRANDEST OF ALL FOR REMEMBER THE COROLLARY WHICH I CHIEFLY INSISTED ON A LITTLE WHILE BACK
AND THIS BEING SO THE WISE MAN CANNOT DOUBT THAT PUNISHMENT IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BAD FOR SINCE GOOD AND BAD AND LIKEWISE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT ARE CONTRARIES IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THAT
TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
SEE HIS PILES OF GOLD RISE HIGH THOUGH HE GATHER STORE OF TREASURE THAT CAN NEVER SATISFY THOUGH WITH PEARLS HIS GORGET BLAZES RAREST THAT THE OCEAN YIELDS THOUGH A HUNDRED HEAD OF OXEN TRAVAIL IN HIS AMPLE FIELDS
THOU ART LURED ON THROUGH ALL MANNER OF HARDSHIPS AND THERE IS AN END TO THY PEACE OF MIND ART FAIN TO LEAD A LIFE OF PLEASURE YET WHO DOES NOT SCORN AND CONTEMN ONE
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED
FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
THOU DIDST MAINTAIN ALSO THAT GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE BY THE GOVERNANCE OF GOODNESS THAT ALL THINGS OBEY HIM WILLINGLY AND THAT EVIL HAS NO EXISTENCE IN NATURE AND ALL THIS
VERILY WONDROUS GREAT ARE THY PROMISES YET I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THOU CANST MAKE THEM GOOD ONLY KEEP ME NOT IN SUSPENSE AFTER RAISING SUCH HOPES LEARN THEN FIRST SAID SHE HOW THAT POWER EVER WAITS UPON THE GOOD
NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
WHILE THE EXTERNAL PARTS HAVE THE STRONG TEXTURE OF WOOD AND OUTSIDE OF ALL IS THE BARK TO RESIST THE WEATHER'S INCLEMENCY LIKE A CHAMPION STOUT IN ENDURANCE AGAIN
SAID SHE IT IS THE SUPREME GOOD WHICH RULES IN STRENGTH AND GRACIOUSLY DISPOSES ALL THINGS THEN SAID I HOW DELIGHTED AM I AT THY REASONINGS AND THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THOU HAST BROUGHT THEM
WAS WE AGREED HAPPINESS WHEREFORE THUS ALSO IT APPEARS THAT IT IS HAPPINESS ALONE WHICH IS SOUGHT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR THAT THE ESSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF HAPPINESS
OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
BECAUSE ORDINARY SPEECH IS APT TO ASSERT AND THAT FREQUENTLY THAT SOME MEN'S FORTUNE IS BAD
YET WITH THY LEAVE WE WILL COUNT IT AMONG THOSE
HEARTILY DO I AGREE AND INDEED I ANTICIPATED WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOUGH IT MAY BE IN FEEBLE SURMISE ONLY I WELL BELIEVE IT SAID SHE FOR AS I THINK
WITH WHAT SPLENDOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHINES WHEREBY IT IS MANIFEST THAT GOODNESS NEVER LACKS ITS REWARD NOR CRIME ITS PUNISHMENT FOR VERILY IN ALL MANNER OF TRANSACTIONS
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
AND REASON THUS SINCE ABSOLUTE GOOD IS HAPPINESS TIS CLEAR THAT ALL THE GOOD MUST BE HAPPY FOR THE VERY REASON THAT THEY ARE GOOD BUT IT WAS AGREED THAT THOSE WHO ARE HAPPY ARE GODS
TO HEAR THE PLAINTIVE STRAIN THE WOODS MOVED IN HIS TRAIN AND THE STREAM CEASED TO FLOW HELD BY SO SOFT A
GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
SO WICKEDNESS ITSELF IS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE UNRIGHTEOUS NOW NO ONE WHO IS VISITED WITH PUNISHMENT DOUBTS THAT HE IS VISITED WITH EVIL ACCORDINGLY
HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING
OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER
AT THY GOOD PLEASURE SAID I THAT WHICH ADVANTAGETH THOU CALLEST GOOD DOST THOU NOT CERTAINLY AND THAT WHICH EITHER TRIES OR AMENDS ADVANTAGETH GRANTED IS GOOD THEN OF COURSE
THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CALLED IMPERFECT IS SPOKEN OF AS IMPERFECT BY REASON OF THE PRIVATION OF SOME PERFECTION
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
WHILE THE EARTH PRESSES DOWNWARD WITH ITS WEIGHT IF IT IS NOT THAT THESE MOTIONS AND SITUATIONS ARE SUITABLE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES MOREOVER EACH SEVERAL THING IS PRESERVED BY THAT WHICH IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE
OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
ANY MORE THAN IT BECOMES A BRAVE SOLDIER TO BE OFFENDED
BUT SWIFTLY FLOW BACK AND MINGLE WITH THOSE PARTS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SEVERED WHILE FIRE AGAIN REFUSES TO BE CUT AT ALL
DON'T TAKE THE TROUBLE DOCTOR SAID MISTER TRAVILLA WE WILL MOUNT AND FOLLOW YOU AT ONCE TO IDENTIFY HIM IF HE IS TO BE FOUND SHALL WE NOT WIFE
I DON'T THINK HE HAD AND IF I'M NOT GREATLY MISTAKEN I DRESSED HIS WOUND IN MY OFFICE THIS MORNING AND LEFT HIM THERE IN CHARGE OF MY BOY NAP BIDDING HIM KEEP THE FELLOW THERE IF POSSIBLE TILL I CAME BACK I'D BETTER RETURN AT ONCE
YOUR TOURNIQUET HAS SAVED YOU FROM BLEEDING TO DEATH TIS WELL YOU KNEW ENOUGH TO APPLY IT THE FLESH IS MUCH TORN WHERE THE BALL PASSED OUT BUT THAT WILL HEAL IN TIME THE DOCTOR'S TASK WAS DONE
MISTER DINSMORE AND THE LADIES SMILED FAINTLY
HE SOON RECOVERED FROM HIS FAINTNESS BUT WAS FOUND TO BE TOTALLY UNFIT FOR DUTY AND SENT TO THE HOSPITAL AT WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS PLACED IN A BED ADJOINING THAT OF HIS BROTHER RICHARD AND ALLOWED TO SHARE WITH HIM IN THE ATTENTIONS OF DOCTOR KING
YES SIR AS AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN DREAM AS I DO THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS AND SOME OF THE OLD SERVANTS WHO PETTED AND HUMORED ME WHILE FATHER AND DAUGHTER CONVERSED THUS TOGETHER IN THE PARLOR A DUSKY FIGURE SAT AT A WINDOW IN THE ADJOINING BEDROOM
ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A SHUDDER AND IN LOW TREMULOUS TONES LEANING ON EDWARD'S ARM AND GAZING INTO HIS FACE WITH EYES SWIMMING WITH TEARS OF LOVE AND GRATITUDE MY WIFE'S ALSO I FEAR
HIS WOUND MUST BE DRESSED AND THAT SPEEDILY YET HOW COULD IT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT IMPERILING LIFE AND LIBERTY PERHAPS HE HAD NOW TWO NEW MURDERS ON HIS HANDS HE DID NOT KNOW
HE COULD HEAR SPRIGGS URGING THEM ON AND ANATHEMATIZING HIM AS A SCOUNDREL ROBBER BURGLAR MURDERER WHO OUGHT TO BE SWUNG UP TO THE NEAREST TREE
SHE COULD ONLY CLING WITH CHOKING SOBS TO HER HUSBAND'S ARM WHAT'S ALL THIS FUSS UNCLE JOE QUERIED THE CAPTAIN LET GO THE OLD DARKIE WHAT'S SHE TO YOU MY WIFE SAH DAT I AIN'T SEED FOR TWENTY YEARS SAH
GOD SHE IS STILL OURS EXCLAIMED THE FATHER ALMOST UNDER HIS BREATH THEN A LITTLE LOUDER ELSIE DEAR WIFE I SHALL GO AT ONCE FOR DOCTOR CHANNING AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN WHO HAS BEEN HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ME
AND A LOW PLAINTIVE MAMMA CAME FROM THE LITTLE LIPS MAMMA IS HERE DARLING ELSIE SAID AMID HER FAST DROPPING TEARS COVERING THE LITTLE WAN FACE WITH KISSES AS SHE HELD IT TO HER BOSOM THANK
YES WE WILL VISIT IT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME THOUGH I HAVE STOOD THERE ALONE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HER BABY DAUGHTER USED TO BE TAKEN THERE FREQUENTLY TO SCATTER FLOWERS OVER IT AND PLAY BESIDE IT
MADE OFF WITH ALL SPEED ACROSS THE LAWN BUT HE WAS BLEEDING AT SO FEARFUL A RATE THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO PAUSE LONG ENOUGH TO IMPROVISE A TOURNIQUET BY KNOTTING HIS HANDKERCHIEF ABOVE THE WOUND
LEST HE SHOULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE DO YOU KNOW THE MAN AND CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM I DO I CAN REPLIED MISTER TRAVILLA BUT MY LITTLE WIFE HOW YOU ARE TREMBLING SIT DOWN HERE DEAREST AND LEAN ON ME
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HER SISTER HAD BEEN AT THAT AGE FULL OF FUN AND FROLICSOME AS A KITTEN VERY FOND OF HER FATHER LIKING TO CLIMB UPON HIS KNEE TO BE PETTED AND CARESSED BUT CLINGING STILL MORE TO HER SWEET GENTLE MAMMA
WENT FAR TO RECONCILE HIM TO THIS LIFE OF INACTIVITY AND INGLORIOUS EASE AS HE TERMED IT IN HIS MOMENTS OF RESTLESS LONGING TO BE AGAIN IN THE FIELD BY THE LAST OF MARCH
AND I HAD THOUGHT OF EDWARD FOR HIS FATHER AND YOURS HORACE EDWARD WILL THAT DO I AM SATISFIED IF YOU ARE BUT EDWARD WOULD DO FOR THE NEXT BUT HE MAY NEVER COME TO CLAIM IT SHE SAID LAUGHING IS PAPA IN THE HOUSE
NEBER SPECTS DIS CHILE LIB TO BEE FREEDOM COME THEN SOBERING DOWN BUT MASSA WE'S BEEN A PRAYIN FOR IT WE'S BEEN CRYING TO THE GOOD LORD LIKE THE CHILLEN OB ISRAEL WHEN DEY'S IN DE HOUSE OB BONDAGE
BUT POWDER AND ROUGE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER CONCEAL THE RAVAGES OF DISCONTENT AND PASSION
AN FIRE HE REVOLVAH AT MASSA AN MISS ELSIE MISS DEM DOUGH AN GOT SHOT HISSELF POSSIBLE CRIED THE DOCTOR IN GREAT EXCITEMENT SPRINGING FROM THE SADDLE AND HURRYING UP THE STEPS OF THE VERANDA
BUT YOU BELONG TO ME STILL SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH GLISTENING EYES THANK YOU DEAREST PAPA
OUR LITTLE VIOLET ELSIE SAID SMILING UP AT THE HAPPY FACE OF HER HUSBAND AS HE BENT OVER HER AND THE BABE SHE HAS COME TO US JUST AS HER NAMESAKES IN AMERICA ARE LIFTING THEIR PRETTY HEADS AMONG THE GRASS THANK YOU DARLING HE ANSWERED SOFTLY TOUCHING HIS LIPS TO HER CHEEK

MY SON
REVENGE AT FIRST THOUGH SWEET BITTER ERELONG BACK ON ITSELF RECOILS MILTON'S PARADISE LOST AT THE INSTANT OF DISCHARGING HIS REVOLVER
THE EYES WERE ROLLED UPWARD THE TINY FISTS TIGHTLY CLENCHED AND THE LITTLE LIMBS HAD GROWN STIFF AND RIGID ON THE MOTHER'S LAP MISTER TRAVILLA HASTILY SET DOWN THE BABE LAID TURNED TO LOOK AT HIS LITTLE GIRL HIS FACE FULL OF ALARM AND DISTRESS
AND YOU CAN HAVE HIM ALWAYS WITH YOU AS LONG AS THE LORD SPARES YOUR LIVES NOW BRESS DE LORD CRIED THE OLD WOMAN DEVOUTLY RAISING HER STREAMING EYES AND CLASPED HANDS TO HEAVEN
THEY WERE BUSY FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO OVER THE PAPERS THERE CRIED ELSIE AT LENGTH WE HAVE EXAMINED THE LAST ONE AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND IT ALL PRETTY THOROUGHLY I THINK YOU DO AND NOW ANOTHER THING
AND YET THE THOUGHT HAS COME TO ME SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT THE OVERSEER HAS HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ABUSE MY POOR PEOPLE IF HE HAPPENS TO BE OF A CRUEL DISPOSITION AND IF HE IS ILL TREATING THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO CATCH HIM AT IT SHE ADDED HER EYES KINDLING AND THE COLOR DEEPENING ON HER CHEEK
BUT I HAVE KEPT MY GREATEST PIECE TILL NOW OUR FAMILY IS GROWING WE HAVE ANOTHER GRANDSON WHO ARRIVED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO HAROLD ALLISON TRAVILLA BY NAME ELSIE IS DOING FINELY THE SLEEPY LITTLE NEWCOMER IS GREATLY ADMIRED AND LOVED BY OLD AND YOUNG
AS I WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIM HE DID NOT FAIL
THE HANDS NEXT BROUGHT HIM AN ELEGANT DRESSING TABLE AND COMBED HIS HAIR SO VERY GENTLY THAT HE SCARCELY FELT THEIR TOUCH THEY HELD BEFORE HIM A BEAUTIFUL BASIN FILLED WITH PERFUMES
HE CAME AT LAST TO THE SQUARE BEFORE ALADDIN'S PALACE THE CROWD AND THE NOISE WERE SO GREAT THAT THE PRINCESS WHO WAS IN THE HALL OF FOUR AND TWENTY WINDOWS HEARD IT AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THE FAIRIES PLACED ME IN A TOWER OF THEIR PALACE ELEGANTLY FURNISHED BUT TO WHICH THERE WAS NO DOOR SO THAT WHOEVER APPROACHED WAS OBLIGED TO COME BY THE WINDOWS WHICH WERE A GREAT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND
AND AT THE SAME TIME I SAW SEVERAL OTHERS FALL DOWN FROM THE ROCKS IN DIFFERENT PLACES I HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS FABULOUS WHAT I HAD HEARD SAILORS AND OTHERS
THE DECREE CAUSED SO MUCH DISCONTENT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE AFFECTION ALADDIN HAD SECURED BY HIS LARGESSES AND CHARITIES THAT THE SULTAN FEARFUL OF AN INSURRECTION WAS OBLIGED TO GRANT HIM HIS LIFE
AND OH HOW GLAD HIS SISTER WAS TO SEE HIM SAFELY RESTING ON HIS SOFT PLEASANT BED A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE HUNTSMEN WERE AGAIN IN THE FOREST AND WHEN THE FAWN HEARD THE HOLLOA HE COULD NOT REST IN PEACE
SO SHE UNTIED HER LITTLE GOLDEN GARTER AND FASTENED IT ROUND THE NECK OF THE FAWN THEN SHE GATHERED SOME SOFT GREEN RUSHES AND BRAIDED THEM INTO A SOFT STRING WHICH SHE FASTENED TO THE FAWN'S GOLDEN COLLAR
FOR THE KING HATED ALL WITTICISMS AND PUNNING ESPECIALLY AND BESIDES HE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE QUEEN MEANT LIGHT HAIRED OR LIGHT HEIRED FOR WHY MIGHT SHE NOT ASPIRATE HER VOWELS WHEN SHE WAS EXASPERATED HERSELF
AND YOUR POOR BEAST SHALL DIE OF SORROW NO SAID BEAUTY CRYING I LOVE YOU TOO WELL TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR DEATH I PROMISE TO RETURN IN A WEEK
THE PRINCESS WHO KNEW NOT THE VALUE OF THIS LAMP AND THE INTEREST THAT ALADDIN HAD TO KEEP IT SAFE ENTERED INTO THE PLEASANTRY AND COMMANDED A SLAVE TO TAKE IT AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE THE SLAVE OBEYED WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND NO SOONER GOT TO THE PALACE GATES
TO WHICH THERE WERE TWENTY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND A DOOR TO EACH OF WHICH MY FATHER KEPT THE KEY SO THAT NONE CAME NEAR ME WITHOUT HIS CONSENT WHEN THE FAIRIES HEARD OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE
AT THIS INSTANT HE FELT HIS HAND SCRATCHED BY THE CLAW OF A CAT UPON WHICH HE AGAIN TOOK COURAGE AND OPENING THE GRAIN OF MILLET SEED TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL PRESENT
AND SAW SUCH A FRIGHTFUL BEAST COMING TOWARDS HIM THAT HE WAS READY TO DROP WITH FEAR UNGRATEFUL MAN SAID THE BEAST IN A TERRIBLE VOICE I HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE BY LETTING YOU INTO MY PALACE
WHILE BEAUTY WAS DRESSING HERSELF A SERVANT BROUGHT WORD TO HER THAT HER SISTERS WERE COME WITH THEIR HUSBANDS TO PAY HER A VISIT THEY BOTH LIVED UNHAPPILY WITH THE GENTLEMEN THEY HAD MARRIED THE HUSBAND OF THE ELDEST WAS VERY HANDSOME BUT WAS SO VERY PROUD OF THIS
OR OTHER USEFUL EMPLOYMENTS AS IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT THESE YOUNG LADIES WOULD HAVE LARGE FORTUNES
THERE WAS POSITIVELY NO DANGER OF LETTING HER FALL THEY MIGHT THROW HER DOWN OR KNOCK HER DOWN OR PUSH HER DOWN BUT THEY COULDN'T LET HER DOWN IT IS TRUE THEY MIGHT LET HER FLY INTO THE FIRE OR THE COAL HOLE OR THROUGH THE WINDOW
WHEN THE HUNTING WAS OVER THE WHOLE RETINUE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND THE WHITE CAT IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED HER DRAGOON'S CAP FOR THE VEIL AND SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH THE PRINCE WHO BEING VERY HUNGRY ATE HEARTILY AND AFTERWARDS PARTOOK WITH HER
THEY WILL NOT HUNT ME UNLESS THEY SEE ME RUNNING AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THAT BUT HIS SISTER WEPT AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO IF THEY KILL YOU DEAR FAWN I SHALL BE HERE ALONE IN THE FOREST FORSAKEN BY THE WHOLE WORLD
ALADDIN HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THIS MANNER SEVERAL YEARS WHEN THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WHO HAD FOR SOME YEARS DISMISSED HIM FROM HIS RECOLLECTION DETERMINED TO INFORM HIMSELF WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER HE PERISHED AS HE SUPPOSED
SHE WITH JOY FOUND HERSELF IN THE PALACE OF THE BEAST SHE DRESSED HERSELF VERY FINELY THAT SHE MIGHT PLEASE HIM THE BETTER AND THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN A DAY PASS AWAY SO SLOW AT LAST THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE
TO SEE AN OLD MAN WITH A BASKET ON HIS ARM FULL OF FINE NEW LAMPS ASKING TO CHANGE THEM FOR OLD ONES THE CHILDREN AND MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY STIR MAKE ALL THE NOISE THEY CAN IN DERISION OF HIM
BUT ALWAYS FOUND THEMSELVES VERY SOON TIRED
THE PRINCESS DAZZLED TO SEE SO MUCH RICHES COLLECTED IN ONE PLACE SAID TO ALADDIN I THOUGHT PRINCE THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AS THE SULTAN MY FATHER'S PALACE BUT THE SIGHT OF THIS HALL ALONE
SAID THE KING SO HE WENT THE NEXT MORNING TO THE HOUSE OF THE PRINCESS AND MAKING A VERY HUMBLE APOLOGY BEGGED HER TO UNDO THE SPELL BUT THE PRINCESS DECLARED WITH A GRAVE FACE THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT HER EYES HOWEVER
EVERY THING WENT ON AS BEFORE TILL THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR AT LENGTH ONLY ONE DAY REMAINED OF THE YEAR WHEN THE WHITE CAT THUS ADDRESSED HIM TO MORROW MY PRINCE
OH THAT'S NOT IT SOBBED HER MAJESTY IT'S MY CHILD MY CHILD WELL WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR CHILD SHE'S NEITHER UP THE CHIMNEY NOR DOWN THE DRAW WELL JUST HEAR HER LAUGHING YET THE KING COULD NOT HELP A SIGH
THE GENIE APPEARED AND SAID
INDEED MY GOOD FAIRY SAID THE MERCHANT ALOUD I AM VASTLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND CARE OF ME HE THEN MADE A HEARTY BREAKFAST TOOK HIS HAT AND WAS GOING TO THE STABLE TO PAY HIS HORSE A VISIT
BUT THE BLOOD AND THE FAT OF THE ELEPHANT RUNNING INTO HIS EYES AND MAKING HIM BLIND HE FALLS TO THE GROUND AND THEN STRANGE TO RELATE THE ROC COMES AND CARRIES THEM BOTH AWAY IN HER CLAWS FOR FOOD FOR HER YOUNG ONES
THAT SHE LOVED THEM FOR ALL THEY HAD USED HER SO ILL AND FORGAVE THEM WITH ALL HER HEART WHEN THE THREE MONTHS WERE PAST THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY GOT READY TO SET OUT FOR THE PALACE OF THE BEAST UPON THIS
THE SULTAN CONSENTED WITH PLEASURE ROSE UP IMMEDIATELY AND PRECEDED BY THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF HIS PALACE AND FOLLOWED BY ALL THE GREAT LORDS OF HIS COURT ACCOMPANIED ALADDIN THE NEARER THE SULTAN APPROACHED ALADDIN'S PALACE THE MORE HE WAS STRUCK WITH ITS BEAUTY
I DESIRE YOU ONLY TO TELL ME IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE OLD LAMP NOW IS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CARRIES IT CAREFULLY WRAPT UP IN HIS BOSOM SAID THE PRINCESS AND THIS I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE HE PULLED IT OUT BEFORE ME AND SHOWED IT TO ME IN TRIUMPH
SAW HER FLOATING AT FULL LENGTH IN THE AIR ABOVE THEM WHENCE SHE REGARDED THEM WITH THE MOST COMICAL APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION ONE DAY AN AWKWARD ACCIDENT HAPPENED THE PRINCESS HAD COME OUT UPON THE LAWN WITH ONE OF HER ATTENDANTS
BUT THE SECOND SON ANSWERED RUDELY WHAT I MIGHT GIVE TO YOU I SHALL WANT MYSELF SO BE OFF THEN HE LEFT THE LITTLE OLD MAN STANDING IN THE ROAD AND WALKED ON HIS PUNISHMENT SOON CAME
DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN AS THE DOOR OPENED THE KING STEPPED IN AND IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT SAW A MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE STANDING BEFORE HIM
BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT THEY COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OTHER ONCE A YEAR HOWEVER WIDELY SEPARATE MIGHT BE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE FROM EACH OTHER THE YOUNGER BROTHER NOT HAVING RECEIVED AS USUAL HIS ANNUAL COMMUNICATION
AND AFTER THE HUNTSMEN WERE GONE LIMP SLOWLY HOME ONE OF THEM HOWEVER DETERMINED TO FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE AND DISCOVER WHERE HE WENT WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM GO UP TO A DOOR AND KNOCK AND TO HEAR HIM SAY
WHICH THE CHIEF OFFICER PERCEIVING TOLD HER IT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO BRING HER TO HER IF SHE DESIRED AND COMMANDED IT AND THE PRINCESS EXPRESSING HER WISHES HE IMMEDIATELY SENT FOUR SLAVES FOR THE PRETENDED HOLY WOMAN
YOU ARE MY OWN BELOVED WIFE AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER THE WICKED WITCH HAD THROWN HER INTO A TRANCE HOPING SHE WOULD DIE AND THAT THE KING WOULD THEN MARRY HER DAUGHTER BUT ON THE KING SPEAKING TO HER THE SPELL WAS BROKEN
AND THE SOUR BEER INTO WINE AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK ENOUGH THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAID BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN KIND HEARTED AND SHARED YOUR DINNER WITH ME I WILL MAKE YOU IN FUTURE LUCKY IN ALL YOU UNDERTAKE
WHEN THE PRETENDED FATIMA HAD MADE HER OBEISANCE THE PRINCESS SAID MY GOOD MOTHER I HAVE ONE THING TO REQUEST WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE ME IT IS TO STAY WITH ME THAT YOU MAY EDIFY ME WITH YOUR WAY OF LIVING AND THAT I MAY LEARN FROM YOUR GOOD EXAMPLE
AND BY HIS SILENCE HE GOT RID OF THE CHILDREN AND THE MOB AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF THE TWO PALACES
FOR HIS LEGS ARE LONG AND MADE FOR RUNNING BUT STRIPED CHIPMUNK WAS NOT FAR BEHIND JOHNNY CHUCK TOOK HIS TIME FOR HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS BESIDES HE WAS SO FAT THAT TO RUN MADE HIM PUFF AND BLOW
OH THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED PETER DRAWING A LONG BREATH THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SPLENDID THING FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE TO DO THEN HE STARTED FOR HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
IT WAS SUCH A GOOD JOKE THAT OLD MISTER POSSUM TRIED IT ON MISTER WOLF AND MISTER FISHER AND MISTER FOX IN FACT HE HUNTED UP EVERY ONE HE COULD THINK OF AND SENT THEM TO CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND WITHOUT REALLY TELLING THEM SO
TOO SMART THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE YES SIR THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS THE SMARTEST OF ALL THE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND THAT WAS A BAD THING
WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF LIVING AND HIS GARDEN OH DEAR ME SUCH A GARDEN YOU NEVER DID SEE IT WAS ALL WEEDS AND BRAMBLES THEY FILLED UP THE YARD
THEN OF COURSE GRANDFATHER FROG KNOWS IT SAID PETER OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF HIM BEFORE EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE SMILING POOL SHOUTED PETER OF COURSE HE DID
BECAUSE HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO MOVE I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM SAID MISTER PANTHER WE CERTAINLY WILL MISS HIM
WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG ALMOST EVERYTHING TO DAY IS THE RESULT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THOSE LONG AGO DAYS THE GREAT GREAT EVER SO GREAT GRANDFATHER OF SPOTTY THE TURTLE LIVED THEN AND UNLIKE SPOTTY WHOM YOU KNOW
AND HE WENT OFF THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST LAUGHING FIT TO KILL HIMSELF PRETTY SOON HE MET MISTER PANTHER HE WAS VERY POLITE TO MISTER PANTHER HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM A CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND HINTED THAT OLD KING BEAR WAS THEN ENJOYING A FEAST
HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE LET HIM FINISH THEN CALLED ALL THE OTHERS ABOUT HER AND TOLD THEM WHO HAD MADE ALL THE TROUBLE
SO HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE AND DUG A HOLE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE COMFORTABLE HE MADE A BIG HOLE WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS TIRED SO HE CURLED UP AT THE BOTTOM FOR A NAP
THEN SOME OF THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME ON THE LAND AS THERE GOT TO BE MORE AND MORE LAND MORE AND MORE OF THE ANIMALS LEFT THE WATER
WHENEVER HE WAS CAUGHT SO THE NEXT TIME HE GOT IN TROUBLE INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY HE TRIED PLAYING DEAD IT WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT HE TAUGHT HIS CHILDREN HOW TO DO IT AND THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN AND SO ON DOWN TO UNC BILLY WHOM YOU KNOW
AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED
BUT MISTER GREENSNAKE NEVER WINKED BACK INSTEAD HE WOULD RAISE HIS HEAD RUN HIS TONGUE OUT AT PETER AND HISS IN WHAT HE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY FIERCE AND ANGRY MANNER THEN PETER WOULD LAUGH
I HAVE A MIND NOT TO JUST TO GET EVEN WITH YOU SAID GRANDFATHER FROG SETTLING HIMSELF COMFORTABLY BUT I BELIEVE I WILL TO SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO CAN TAKE A JOKE WITHOUT LOSING THEIR TEMPER
PETER RABBIT HAD SEEN HIM WHEN HE WENT BY ON HIS WAY TO THE LAUGHING BROOK AND THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR SOME ONE TO PASS THE TIME OF DAY WITH SPOTTY WAS STILL THERE WHEN PETER RETURNED A LONG TIME AFTER AND HE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF HE HAD MOVED
LEAVE HIM HERE AS A WARNING TO OTHERS GROWLED OLD KING BEAR EACH IN TURN CAME UP AND SNIFFED OF MISTER POSSUM AND THEN THEY ALL WENT ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT
I REALLY BELIEVE HE CAN'T FOLD HIS HANDS SAID HAPPY JACK TO HIMSELF BUT SPEAKING ALOUD HE CAN'T AND NONE OF HIS FAMILY CAN SAID A GRUFF VOICE HAPPY JACK TURNED TO FIND OLD MISTER TOAD SITTING IN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND BECAUSE HE IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE JUST THEN UP CAME PETER RABBIT ALL OUT OF BREATH HAS GRANDFATHER FROG BEEN TELLING A STORY HE PANTED
CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE REALLY LIVES HERE THEN PEERING THROUGH THE TANGLE OF BRAMBLES SHE SPIED OLD MISTER RABBIT SITTING ON HIS BROKEN DOWN DOORSTEP WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND FAST ASLEEP AT FIRST SHE WAS VERY INDIGNANT
EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND WHENEVER HE MADE A CALL HE WAS SURE OF A WELCOME BUT ONE THING MISTER MOLE NEVER DID HE NEVER MEDDLED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS NO SIR
CHUG A RUM RETORTED GRANDFATHER FROG IF HE HAD
HIS HOUSE WAS WITH HIM AND NOW HE HAD SIMPLY RETIRED INSIDE HE DIDN'T NEED ANY OTHER HOUSE THAN JUST THAT HARD SPOTTED SHELL INSIDE OF WHICH HE WAS NOW SO COSILY TUCKED AWAY THAT'S A GREAT IDEA HO HO HO
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN AWAY WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED BY HIS ENEMIES THEY ALWAYS TRIED TO RUN AWAY SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE EXCEPTING UNC BILLY POSSUM THERE MUST BE A REASON SAID PETER GRAVELY
SEEMED LIKE HE WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF HE COULDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE IT WAS ALL BECAUSE HE WAS SO DREADFULLY CURIOUS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS JUST AS PETER RABBIT IS NOW IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS JUST BORN TO BE CURIOUS AND SO OF COURSE TO GET INTO TROUBLE
FUNNY PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE ISN'T IT JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY IT DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE HE ADMITTED IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE BUT THEN JERRY MUSKRAT IS A FUNNY FELLOW
IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPRINGTIME AND SUMMERTIME AND AUTUMNTIME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND JUST THINK OF ALL THAT MINER MISSES THE SUNSHINE THE FLOWERS THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TO PLAY WITH I WONDER
I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED FINALLY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE OF COURSE THERE MUST BE A REASON HE NEVER COMES OUT TO PLAY WITH THE REST OF US JUST SPENDS ALL HIS TIME BY HIMSELF DOWN IN THE DARK DIGGING AND DIGGING I WONDER
WHAT DO YOU WONDER HE REPEATED STRIPED CHIPMUNK MADE A FACE AT JOHNNY I WONDER SOMETHING THAT I BET YOU DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED THAT'S EASY REPLIED JOHNNY THERE ARE MORE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAN I DO KNOW
CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE OF COURSE REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH PUT OUT AT SUCH A FOOLISH QUESTION
IT WAS GREAT FUN THEY RACED AND DODGED AND TWISTED AND TURNED SOMETIMES PETER WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE WOULD FORGET AND USE ALL FOUR LEGS THEN JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD SHOUT NO FAIR
OBEYING THE ORDERS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM WHEN SHE HAD VISITED THEM LAST MY MY MY SUCH A HURRYING AND SCURRYING AND WORRYING AS THERE WAS YOU SEE EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED YES SIR EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST
AND EVEN HAD ASKED UNC BILLY ABOUT IT UNC BILLY HAD JUST GRINNED AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS MAMMY OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND UNC BILLY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITHOUT ME TELLING YOU THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR SPOTTY'S CARRYING HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM BECAUSE THERE IS A REASON FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT REASON IS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO
THAT GAVE MISTER RABBIT AN IDEA HE WOULD ASK ALL HIS NEIGHBORS TO HELP HIM AND PERHAPS THEN HE COULD GET HIS HOUSE AND GARDEN IN ORDER BY THE TIME OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED SO MISTER RABBIT CALLED ON MISTER SKUNK
WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS A JOKE HAD BECOME NO LONGER A LAUGHING MATTER FOR HIM HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN SO HE SCRAMBLED UP A TREE HE QUITE FORGOT THAT MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX COULD CLIMB JUST AS FAST AS HE
AS HE PULLED THOUGHTFULLY AT ONE OF HIS LONG EARS OF COURSE THERE IS A REASON ASSERTED JOHNNY CHUCK CHEWING THE END OF A BLADE OF GRASS THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING ADDED STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMBING OUT THE HAIR OF HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL
FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE MISTER MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
BUT NOW AS HE LOOKED AT THIS ONE IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN MINER THE MOLE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN ALL HIS LIFE WHAT A QUEER WAY OF LIVING THOUGHT STRIPED CHIPMUNK
MISTER MOLE SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN HIS TUNNELS AND SELDOM PUT HIS NOSE OUTSIDE HE WAS SAFE AND HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO EAT BY DIGGING FOR IT LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS OLD NEIGHBORS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIM
THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO WAS TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO HE LEARNED TO SWIM WITH ONLY HIS HEAD OUT OF WATER AND SOMETIMES WITH ONLY THE END OF HIS NOSE OUT OF WATER
AS AFFORDING HOPES FOR SOME YEARS TO BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE BIRTH OF AN HEIR TO THE THRONE THE ELECTIONS OF NINETEEN O ONE FOUND THE LIBERAL MINISTRY OUT OF FAVOUR THROUGH THE LAWS ENFORCING MILITARY SERVICE AND OBLIGATORY ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL
AFTER A SIEGE LASTING FROM JULY NINTH TO AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH HAD TO RETIRE FROM GRONINGEN THE FRENCH ARMIES WERE ALL THIS TIME BEING CONSTANTLY WEAKENED
HAD TURENNE AND LUXEMBURG MADE A UNITED EFFORT TO FORCE THIS LINE AT THE OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED INSTEAD OF DOING SO THEY EXPENDED THEIR ENERGIES IN THE CAPTURE OF A NUMBER OF FORTIFIED PLACES IN GELDERLAND OVERYSSEL
AND WITH COLOGNE MAY ELEVENTH ON THE BASIS OF THE EVACUATION OF ALL CONQUERED TERRITORY FRANCE WAS ISOLATED AND OPPOSED NOW BY A STRONG COALITION THE REPUBLIC HAVING SECURED THE HELP OF AUSTRIA SPAIN BRANDENBURG
A STUBBORN ACTION TOOK PLACE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SCHELDT ON JUNE SEVENTH IN WHICH THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM THE FRENCH SQUADRON AND FINALLY RETIRED TO THE ESTUARY OF THE THAMES
THAT WHAT THE ENGLISH REALLY WANTED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A BINDING ALLIANCE OR RATHER COALITION AS WOULD PRACTICALLY MERGE THE LESSER STATE IN THE GREATER BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A LOSS OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST WON WAS TO THE NETHERLANDERS UNTHINKABLE
NEVER DID DE RUYTER EXHIBIT HIGHER QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP THAN IN THE NAVAL CAMPAIGN OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE HIS FLEET WAS GREATLY INFERIOR IN NUMBERS TO THE COMBINED ANGLO FRENCH FLEET UNDER PRINCE RUPERT AND D'ESTREES
IT CAME SUDDENLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING THE DUTCH ADMIRAL WHILE CRUISING PAST DOVER MET ON MAY TWENTY NINTH FIFTEEN ENGLISH SHIPS UNDER BLAKE
AND TO HIM THE EYES OF A LARGE PARTY IN ENGLAND WERE TURNING
ALARM AT THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE FRENCH POWER BROUGHT AT LAST BOTH SPANISH AND AUSTRIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE HARD PRESSED NETHERLANDS AND THE COURAGE AND SKILL OF DE RUYTER HELD SUCCESSFULLY AT BAY THE UNITED FLEETS OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE AND EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED THE LANDING OF AN ARMY ON THE DUTCH COAST
STORMY WEATHER COMPELLED HIM TO SEND THE CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT INTO SHELTER BUT HE HIMSELF WITH SIXTY SHIPS SET OUT TO SEEK THE ENGLISH FLEET WHICH LAY IN THE DOWNS AFTER SOME MANOEUVRING THE TWO FLEETS MET ON DECEMBER TENTH OFF DUNGENESS
THIS WAS AGREED TO AND ON JUNE SEVENTH THE DOCUMENT WAS DULY FORWARDED TO LONDON BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
IN THE EARLY SUMMER OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN WILLIAM RESOLVED TO CONCENTRATE ALL HIS AVAILABLE FORCES FOR THE DEFENCE OF HOLLAND COVERED BY ITS WATER LINE THE MILITARY SITUATION WAS APPARENTLY HOPELESS
THE PRINCE BADE FAREWELL TO THE STATES GENERAL ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH AND FOUR DAYS LATER HE SET SAIL FROM HELVOETSLUIS BUT WAS DRIVEN BACK BY A HEAVY STORM WHICH SEVERELY DAMAGED THE FLEET
HE HAD AT HIS SIDE AS HIS FIELD MARSHAL GEORGE FREDERICK COUNT OF WALDECK AN OFFICER OF EXPERIENCE AND SKILL WHO HAD ENTERED THE REPUBLIC'S SERVICE
WILLIAM ACCORDINGLY ARRIVED IN LONDON ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH AND THE ASSENT OF THE KING AND THE DUKE OF YORK BEING OBTAINED THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH ALMOST INDECENT HASTE IT WAS A PURELY POLITICAL UNION AND WHEN EARLY IN DECEMBER THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE SET SAIL FOR HOLLAND
HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNITING THE THREE CHURCH GROUPS THE DEMOCRATIC ANTI REVOLUTIONARIES THE ARISTOCRATIC HISTORICAL CHRISTIANS BOTH ORTHODOX CALVINISTS AND THE CATHOLICS OF ALL SECTIONS INTO A CHRISTIAN COALITION
BUT FOR SOME FIVE WEEKS THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACT WAS UNKNOWN TO THE STATES GENERAL AND DURING THAT PERIOD
PROVED WORTHY SUCCESSORS OF VAN BEVERNINGH AND VAN BEUNINGEN
ON AUGUST TENTH JUST BEFORE TIME FOR RESUMING HOSTILITIES HAD BEEN REACHED THEY TACTFULLY CONCEDED THIS POINT AND PROMISED IMMEDIATE EVACUATION IF THE TREATY WERE AT ONCE CONCLUDED VAN BEVERNINGH AND HIS COLLEAGUES ACCORDINGLY ACTING ON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
AT LAST CROMWELL FORMULATED HIS PROPOSALS IN TWENTY SEVEN ARTICLES THE DEMANDS WERE THOSE OF THE VICTOR AND WERE SEVERE ALL THE OLD DISPUTES WERE TO BE SETTLED IN FAVOUR OF ENGLAND AN ANNUAL SUM WAS TO BE PAID FOR THE RIGHT OF FISHING
TO THESE WERE NOW ADDED THE EMPEROR AND THE POPE WHO BEING ACTUALLY AT WAR WITH FRANCE WERE READY TO LOOK FAVOURABLY UPON AN EXPEDITION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE COMMON ENEMY
THE DUTCH PEOPLE GENERALLY HAD SUFFERED TERRIBLY IN THE LATE INVASIONS AND WERE HEARTILY SICK OF WAR THE INTEREST OF THE HOLLANDERS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE AMSTERDAMMERS WAS ABSORBED IN THE PEACEFUL PURSUITS OF COMMERCE
THE STATES THOUGH MUCH PERPLEXED TO FIND A SUCCESSOR TO MARTIN TROMP WERE SO FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED THAT GREAT ENERGY WAS SHOWN IN REORGANISING THE FLEET
HE STEADFASTLY BIDED HIS TIME AND OPPORTUNITY IT NOW CAME QUICKLY FOR THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WAS MARKED BY TWO EVENTS
THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT THERE WAS IN ENGLAND A VERY STRONG AND WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION TO THE SUCCESSION OF JAMES DUKE OF YORK WHO MADE NO SECRET OF HIS DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH SO STRONG WAS THE FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO RESIGN HIS POST OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL
BUT TO BE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF A BELT OF FORTRESSES TO COVER THEIR NETHERLAND POSSESSIONS AGAINST FURTHER FRENCH ATTACK
THE PRINCE WAS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO THE ENGLISH OFFER OF MEDIATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS INSINCERE AND PREMATURE
DESPITE THE STRONG OPPOSITION HE ENCOUNTERED AT AMSTERDAM AND SOME OTHER TOWNS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE REIGNED SUPREME
ARTICLE TWELVE STIPULATED THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD NOT AT ANY TIME HOLD ANY OF THE OFFICES OR DIGNITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY HIS ANCESTORS OR BE APPOINTED TO ANY MILITARY COMMAND
THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FIRST SET TO WORK TO HAVE THE TREATY FROM WHICH THE EXCLUSION ARTICLE HAD BEEN CUT OUT RATIFIED RAPIDLY BY THE STATES GENERAL
DESTROYED A BRITISH SQUADRON OFF LEGHORN MARCH TWENTY THIRD IN BOTH COUNTRIES THERE WAS A PEACE PARTY
THEY FURTHER DEMANDED THAT DUTCH COMMANDERS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENGLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY BY STRIKING FLAG AND SAIL AND BY FIRING A SALUTE WHENEVER ANY OF THEIR SQUADRONS MET ENGLISH SHIPS IN THE NARROW SEAS IT WAS THESE LAST TWO QUESTIONS
WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PRESENT SUCH PROPOSALS TO THE STATES GENERAL NOT ONLY WOULD THEY INDIGNANTLY REJECT THEM BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF GETTING ANY SINGLE PROVINCE EVEN HOLLAND TO ALLOW A FOREIGN POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS
THEY HELD THAT IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO ATTEND TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND TO LEAVE LOUIS TO PURSUE HIS AGGRESSIVE POLICY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES SO LONG AS HE LEFT THEM ALONE THE IDEAL WHICH WILLIAM THE THIRD HAD SET BEFORE HIM WAS THE EXACT REVERSE OF THIS AND
OR COMMANDER OF MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES
THE ILL SUCCESS OF TROMP THOUGH HE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR IT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AND DISCONTENT IN HOLLAND HIS ENEMIES OF THE STATES PARTY IN THAT PROVINCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO SUSPEND THE GALLANT OLD SEAMAN FROM HIS COMMAND HE WAS AN ORANGIST
THE ATTENTION OF THE EMPEROR WAS FULLY OCCUPIED IN DEFENDING HUNGARY AND VIENNA ITSELF AGAINST THE TURKS
THE THREAT WAS MET WITH FIRMNESS AN ANTI STRIKE LAW WAS QUICKLY PASSED THE MILITARY WAS CALLED OUT AND THE STRIKE COLLAPSED
THE ESTATES ADJOURNED FOR A RECESS ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE PRESENTED THE TREATY TO THE STATES GENERAL
NOT MERELY BY PRIVATEERS BUT BY AN ENGLISH SQUADRON UNDER AYSCUE IN THE WEST INDIES HAD CAUSED INTENSE INDIGNATION AND ALARM IN HOLLAND AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE STATES GENERAL AND THE ADMIRALTIES
WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER A DISSOLUTION OF THIS CHAMBER LED TO THE MAJORITY BEING REVERSED AND THE MEASURE WAS PASSED ANOTHER MEASURE REVISED THE MACKAY LAW AND CONFERRED A LARGER SUBSIDY ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS
THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WAS MEMORABLE FOR THE MEETING OF THE FIRST PEACE CONGRESS
IN A CONFLICT WHICH PLACED THEM IN A MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS POSITION ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY HAD TO TAKE A CRITICAL DECISION WAS THE CLOSING OF THE SCHELDT AS SOON AS GREAT BRITAIN DECLARED WAR ON GERMANY AUGUST FOURTH
HE ALWAYS INSISTED THAT HE WAS ACCREDITED TO THE STATES GENERAL
BUT THE ENGLISH COUNCIL HAD NOT FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION THE DEATH OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
HE CONFESSED ON ONE OCCASION TO BISHOP BURNET THAT HIS CHURLISHNESS WAS PARTLY DUE TO JEALOUSY HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT MARY MIGHT SUCCEED TO THE ENGLISH THRONE AND HE WOULD IN THAT COUNTRY BE INFERIOR IN RANK TO HIS WIFE
THE NOMINATION OR THE CHOICE OUT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NOMINEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TOWN CORPORATIONS OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE AND OF THE DELEGATES TO THE STATES GENERAL WAS GRANTED TO HIM THE DUTCH REPUBLIC WAS FULL OF ANOMALIES
ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
THE BOY SKINNED THE CALF AND THE COW THAT HE HAD KILLED AND THEN HE PACKED ALL THE MEAT ON THE HORSE AND PUT THE SPOTTED ROBE ON TOP OF THE LOAD AND STARTED BACK TO THE CAMP ON FOOT LEADING THE DUN HORSE BUT EVEN WITH THIS HEAVY LOAD THE HORSE PRANCED ALL THE TIME AND WAS SCARED AT EVERYTHING HE SAW
WHEN THEY CAME TO A MISERABLE OLD WORNOUT DUN HORSE WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY SOME INDIANS HE WAS THIN AND EXHAUSTED WAS BLIND OF ONE EYE HAD A BAD SORE BACK AND ONE OF HIS FORELEGS WAS VERY MUCH SWOLLEN
FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
ON THE WAY TO CAMP ONE OF THE RICH YOUNG CHIEFS OF THE TRIBE RODE UP BY THE BOY AND OFFERED HIM TWELVE GOOD HORSES FOR THE SPOTTED ROBE
I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
THE TWO POOR INDIANS FOLLOWED THEM AND CAMPED WITH THE OTHERS ONE DAY WHILE THEY WERE HERE THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BEEN SENT OUT TO LOOK FOR BUFFALO CAME HURRYING INTO CAMP AND TOLD THE CHIEFS THAT A LARGE HERD OF BUFFALO WERE NEAR AND THAT AMONG THEM WAS A SPOTTED CALF
SHE NOTICED IT AND RAN AT HIS HEELS FULL SPEED AFTER HIM HE LOOKED ROUND
THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
WENT ON AND ON ALONGSIDE OF IT TILL HE CAME TO THE FOUNTAIN HEAD HAVING LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO SEE WHERE THE DAMSEL WAS
THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
YOU HAVE SEEN HOW IT HAS BEEN THIS DAY AND FROM THIS YOU MAY KNOW HOW IT WILL BE AFTER THIS BUT TI RA' WA HAS BEEN GOOD AND HAS LET ME COME BACK TO YOU AFTER THIS DO WHAT I TELL YOU NOT ANY MORE NOT ANY LESS
WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
AND PIERCED HIM THROUGH AND THE HORSE FELL DOWN DEAD BUT THE BOY JUMPED OFF AND FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH THE SIOUX AND RAN AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE PAWNEES NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSE WAS KILLED THE SIOUX SAID TO EACH OTHER THIS HORSE WAS LIKE A MAN HE WAS BRAVE HE WAS NOT LIKE A HORSE
AND AS HE LOOKED THROUGH THE DRIVING RAIN TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE PIECES LAY HE THOUGHT THAT THEY SEEMED TO COME TOGETHER AND TAKE SHAPE AND THAT THE PILE LOOKED LIKE A HORSE LYING DOWN BUT HE COULD NOT SEE WELL FOR THE THICK RAIN AFTER THIS CAME A THIRD STORM LIKE THE OTHERS
AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
SUDDENLY AWAY OFF TO THE RIGHT WAS SEEN THE OLD DUN HORSE HE DID NOT SEEM TO RUN HE SEEMED TO SAIL ALONG LIKE A BIRD HE PASSED ALL THE FASTEST HORSES AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS AMONG THE BUFFALO FIRST HE PICKED OUT THE SPOTTED CALF
MUCH MORE HANDSOME THAN ANY HORSE IN THE TRIBE THAT NIGHT THE DUN HORSE TOLD THE BOY TO TAKE HIM AGAIN TO THE PLACE BEHIND THE BIG HILL AND TO COME FOR HIM THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN THE BOY WENT FOR HIM AGAIN
AND HAVE KILLED FOUR SIOUX AND I AM ALL RIGHT I AM NOT HURT ANYWHERE WHY MAY I NOT GO AGAIN SO HE JUMPED ON THE DUN HORSE AND CHARGED AGAIN BUT WHEN HE GOT AMONG THE SIOUX ONE SIOUX WARRIOR DREW AN ARROW AND SHOT THE ARROW STRUCK THE DUN HORSE BEHIND THE FORELEGS
AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
AND THE OLD WOMAN SAID WHY DO YOU COME TO TELL ME THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO MAKE FUN OF MY BOY BECAUSE HE IS POOR
I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
THERE IS THE HORSE THAT IS GOING TO CATCH THE SPOTTED CALF AND THEY LAUGHED AT HIM SO THAT THE POOR BOY WAS ASHAMED AND RODE OFF TO ONE SIDE OF THE CROWD WHERE HE COULD NOT HEAR THEIR JOKES AND LAUGHTER
AND WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE SPOTTED CALF HE ORDERED HIS OLD CRIER TO GO ABOUT THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND CALL OUT THAT THE MAN WHO KILLED THE SPOTTED CALF SHOULD HAVE HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIS WIFE FOR A SPOTTED ROBE
LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
MY PARTING RIGHT QUICKLY THAT I MAY COME TO MINE OWN COUNTRY TOO LONG HAVE I SUFFERED GREAT SORROWS FAR AWAY FROM MY OWN FRIENDS THEN HE SAT DOWN AMONGST THE ASHES BY THE FIRE AND FOR A LITTLE SPACE NO ONE SPOKE
THE DWELLERS IN THAT LAND FED ON THE HONEY SWEET FRUIT OF THE LOTUS FLOWER THOSE WHO ATE THE LOTUS CEASED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A PAST OR A FUTURE
LOKI OFFERED TO GIVE ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO SAVE HIMSELF BUT THE DWARF WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANY OF THEM CATCH ME THEN CRIED THE MISCHIEVOUS ONE BUT WHEN BROK STRETCHED HIS HAND UPON HIM LOKI HAD GONE
HE WISHED TO EMBRACE HIM ONCE MORE BEFORE DYING BUT FEARFUL LEST HE SHOULD IN SO DOING INFECT HIS FRIEND WITH THE DEADLY POISON THAT WAS CONSUMING HIM HE CRIED IN HIS AGONY ALAS I AM NOT EVEN PERMITTED TO EMBRACE THEE
IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO DID NOT SPEAK WELL OF HER IT HAPPENED ONE DAY WHEN THE SUMMER WAS NEARLY GONE THAT LOKI FOUND SIB ALONE AND SLEEPING ON A BANK NEAR THE RIVER SO HE DREW HIS KNIFE AND CREEPING SOFTLY NEARER AND NEARER CUT OFF HER BEAUTIFUL FLOWING HAIR QUITE CLOSE TO HER HEAD
AND MADE THEM FLOW RIGHT THROUGH THE STABLES THEMSELVES AND LO THE NUISANCE THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR THIRTY YEARS WAS NO MORE SUCH WAS THE FIFTH LABOR OF HERCULES ON AN ISLAND IN A LAKE NEAR STYMPHALUS IN ARCADIA
ALL THE YEAR ROUND THERE WAS FRUIT IN THAT GARDEN THERE WERE GRAPES IN BLOSSOM AND GRAPES PURPLE AND READY TO EAT
IN PUNISHMENT FOR THE EVIL THAT HE HAD DONE HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO BANISH HIM AND TO IMPOSE SUCH TASKS UPON HIM AS MUST CERTAINLY BRING ABOUT HIS DESTRUCTION HENCE AROSE THE FAMOUS TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES
BUT SIR LUCAN HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE BATTLE AND AS HE LIFTED THE KING HE FELL BACK AND DIED
HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
YOU MUST GIVE BACK TO ME WHEN HE SAID THIS TO THE MAID SHE CONSENTED AND DEPARTED QUICKLY BUT HARISARMAN REFLECTED IN HIS ASTONISHMENT
HE FURTHER ENJOINED HIS FRIEND TO LET NO MAN KNOW OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM LIFE TO THE INTENT THAT THE FEAR OF HIS APPROACH MIGHT PREVENT FRESH MONSTERS AND NEW ROBBERS FROM RAVAGING THE EARTH THUS DIED HERCULES
HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
SAYING THAT WHATEVER HE STRUCK WITH IT WOULD BE DESTROYED THAT NO BLOW COULD BE HARD ENOUGH TO HURT IT THAT IF HE THREW IT IT WOULD RETURN TO HIM SO THAT HE COULD NEVER LOSE IT AND THAT AS HE WISHED SO WOULD ITS SIZE BE
BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
BECAUSE THE GIANT AMERAUNT WAS KEEPING HIS DAUGHTER AND FIFTEEN SONS IN A STRONG CASTLE I AM EARL JONAS OF DURRAS HE SAID AND I SEEK GUY OF WARWICK TO HELP ME GUY SAID IF THE EARL WOULD GIVE HIM MEAT AND DRINK
AND BEGGED ODYSSEUS TO TRY HE CAST A STONE HEAVIER THAN ALL OTHERS FAR BEYOND WHERE THE PHAEACIANS HAD THROWN THAT NIGHT
IN ADDITION AN IMMENSE ROCK HUNG OVER HIS HEAD THREATENED EVERY MOMENT TO CRUSH HIM IT IS SAID THAT TANTALUS WHEN IN THE FLESH HAD BETRAYED THE SECRETS OF THE GODS AND ALSO COMMITTED OTHER GREAT CRIMES
FOR SOME TIME GUY AND PHYLLIS LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER THEN ONE SAD DAY EARL ROHAND DIED AND GUY BECAME EARL OF WARWICK AS THE NEW EARL WAS ONE DAY THINKING OF HIS PAST LIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD CAUSED MUCH BLOODSHED
IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
ALL DAY IT LASTED BEFORE GUY WITH HIS SWORD CUT THE GIANT'S HEAD OFF TAKING THE KEYS OF THE CASTLE WHICH LAY ON THE GROUND HE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED EARL OF JONAS'S CHILDREN AND OTHER NOBLE KNIGHTS AND BRAVE LADIES
WHICH MEANS TONGUE WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER BROTHER HAD STOLEN THAT TREASURE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE PALACE SHE BEING ALARMED AT HARISARMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
OR DELIVER OVER HIS KINGDOM SO THE KING HAD SENT MESSENGERS NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST BUT IN ALL THE LAND NO KNIGHT COULD BE FOUND WHO WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO FACE THE AWFUL GIANT AND NOW WITHIN THE GREAT CHURCH OF WINCHESTER
FOR THE ENEMY LAY BEFORE THE KING'S CITY OF WINCHESTER WITH THEM WAS A TERRIBLE GIANT CALLED COLBRAND AND ANLAF HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO KING ATHELSTANE AS THE KING WHO NOW REIGNED OVER ALL ENGLAND WAS CALLED DEMANDING THAT HE SHOULD EITHER FIND A CHAMPION TO FIGHT WITH COLBRAND
AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
AND DREAMING THE HAPPY HOURS AWAY BACK TO THE SHIPS ODYSSEUS DRAGGED THE UNWILLING MEN WEEPING THAT THEY MUST LEAVE SO MUCH JOY BEHIND
HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
WITH A GREAT LOVE HE LOVED HIS FAIR WIFE AND LITTLE SON AND OLD FATHER AND HIS LITTLE KINGDOM BY THE SEA WAS VERY DEAR TO HIM I CAN SEE NOUGHT BESIDE SWEETER THAN A MAN'S OWN COUNTRY HE SAID
AND WENT TO TELL HER FATHER HER MOTHER WAS SITTING SPINNING YARN OF SEA PURPLE STAIN AND HER FATHER WAS JUST GOING TO A COUNCIL MEETING FATHER DEAR SAID THE PRINCESS COULDST THOU LEND ME A HIGH WAGON WITH STRONG WHEELS
AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
ON LEAVING THE CITY THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A GRAVEYARD WHERE A FEW PEOPLE WERE PRAYING BESIDE A TOMB AND DISTRIBUTING CHAPATIS AND KULCHAS TO PASSERS BY IN THE NAME OF THEIR BELOVED DEAD THEY BECKONED TO THE TWO TRAVELERS AND GAVE THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD
AND FREY SHOULD BE JUDGES IN THIS CASE FIRST LOKI OFFERED TO ODIN THE SPEAR GUNGNER WHICH WAS SO WONDERFULLY MADE THAT IT NEVER FAILED TO HIT THE THING AT WHICH IT WAS THROWN AND IT ALWAYS SPED BACK TO THE HAND WHICH HAD THROWN IT LATER WHEN ODIN CARRIED THIS SPEAR IN BATTLE
ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
NO ONE COULD SEE HOW THEY CAME THIS THE GREATEST OF THE GODS EVER WORE UPON HIS ARM UNTIL THE DEATH OF HIS BEAUTIFUL SON BALDUR WHEN AS TOKEN OF HIS GREAT LOVE
BUT IF HE SHOOK IT OVER HIS FRIENDS THEY WERE SO FILLED WITH COURAGE THAT THEY COULD NOT BE CONQUERED THEN THOR RECEIVED THE HAIR
TO CAPTURE THE OXEN OF GERYON WAS THE TENTH LABOR OF HERCULES IN THE PERSON OF GERYON WE MEET ANOTHER OF THOSE STRANGE BEINGS IN WHICH THE MAKERS OF MYTHS AND FAIRY TALES SEEM TO REVEL GERYON WAS A THREE BODIED MONSTER
WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
THEN WITH STRENGTH AND GENTLENESS HE WROUGHT WITH HIS TOOLS HAVING CAST NOTHING INTO THE HEAT BUT THE PIG SKIN WITH MIGHTY BLOWS AND DELICATE TOUCHES HE BROUGHT THICKNESS AND SUBSTANCE INTO IT UNTIL A BOARD LOOKED AT HIM FROM THE FLAMES
SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER PREVENT HIM FROM HAVING AN HONORABLE CAREER SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN THAT HE SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER ALL DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES THAT MIGHT BESET HIM ALL THAT WAS CONCEDED TO HER WAS THAT HERCULES SHOULD BE PUT UNDER THE DOMINION OF EURYSTHEUS KING OF THEBES
WHILE WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER HE ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD CARRY ME OR I SHOULD CARRY HIM AS HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A PLEASANTER MODE OF PROCEEDING MOST ASSUREDLY SAID THE GIRL HE MEANT THAT ONE OF YOU SHOULD TELL A STORY TO BEGUILE THE TIME
HOW GUY FOUGHT WITH THE GIANT COLBRAND FOR SOME TIME AFTER GUY WENT AWAY PHYLLIS WAS VERY SORROWFUL SHE WEPT AND MOURNED
AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
SPINNING BY THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF A LAMP THEY WERE THE FATES DEITIES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO THREAD THE DAYS OF ALL MORTALS WHO APPEARED ON EARTH WERE IT BUT FOR AN INSTANT CLOTHO THE SPINNER OF THE THREAD OF LIFE WAS THE ELDEST OF THE THREE SHE HELD IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
BOLD ENOUGH TO DO BATTLE FOR HIS KING AND COUNTRY OH THAT GUY OF WARWICK WERE HERE THEN THROUGH THE BRIGHT CROWD OF STEEL CLAD NOBLES THERE CAME A TALL OLD MAN DRESSED IN A WORN DARK PILGRIM'S ROBE
ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH OF JULY WHILE ALL WAS HILARITY AND REJOICING THE ABOVE NAMED VERY INTERESTING FUGITIVES ARRIVED FROM THE TROUBLED DISTRICT THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND WHERE SO MANY CONVENTIONS HAD BEEN HELD THE PREVIOUS YEAR TO PREVENT ESCAPES
AND ARE NOW BOTH IN THE CITY I AM A BLACKSMITH AND HAVE WORKED SIX MONTHS IN ONE SHOP IN NEW YORK WITH WHITE JOURNEYMEN NOT ONE OF WHOM BELIEVES I SUPPOSE THAT I AM A COLORED MAN IT WAS NOT SURPRISING FOR SO FAIR WAS HIS COMPLEXION
I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF ADDRESSING YOU WITH THESE FEW LINES HOPING THAT YOU WILL ATTEND TO WHAT I SHALL REQUEST OF YOU I HAVE WRITTEN TO VIRGINIA AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ANSWER YET I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN GET ANY ONE OF YOUR CITY TO GO TO RICHMOND FOR ME
AND CHARLES HENRY SALTER CHASKEY IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK MEDIUM SIZE SOUND BODY AND INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE NEVERTHELESS HE RESEMBLED A FARM HAND IN EVERY PARTICULAR
AND WHEN I WAS SICK I HAD TO PAY JUST AS MUCH AS IF I WERE WELL SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH BUT MY MASTER WAS CROSS AND SAID THAT HE INTENDED TO SELL ME TO DO BETTER BY ME ANOTHER YEAR TIMES GREW WORSE AND WORSE CONSTANTLY
THEY HAD LIVED WITH MASSEY FIVE YEARS UP TO THE LAST MARCH PRIOR TO THEIR ESCAPE HAVING BEEN BOUGHT OUT OF THE BALTIMORE SLAVE PEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE TO BE FREE AT THE EXPIRATION OF FIVE YEARS SERVICE UNDER HIM THE FIVE YEARS HAD MORE THAN EXPIRED BUT NO HOPE OR SIGN OF FREEDOM APPEARED
AGAINST HIM HOWEVER WILLIAM BROUGHT NO ACCUSATION OF ANY VERY SEVERE TREATMENT ON THE CONTRARY
AND WHEN MAD WOULD HIT ONE OF HIS SLAVES WITH ANYTHING HE COULD GET IN HIS HANDS JOHN AND HIS COMPANION MADE THE LONG JOURNEY ON FOOT THE FORMER HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FARM LABOR AND THE COMMON DRUDGERY OF SLAVE LIFE BEING A MAN OF THIRTY THREE YEARS OF AGE WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY ABILITIES
IF HE HAD JUSTICE DONE HIM HE WOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THIS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HIMSELF AND ALL HIS OTHER RIGHTS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TOIL FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT PAY SO HE LOOKED SERIOUSLY INTO THE MATTER OF MASTER AND SLAVE
ONE DOLLAR IS THE USUAL ALLOWANCE FOR SLAVES IN MY SITUATION ON CHRISTMAS WEEK HE ALLOWED ME NO BOARD MONEY BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF SEVENTY FIVE CENTS MY MISTRESS ADDED TWENTY FIVE CENTS WHICH WAS THE EXTENT OF THEIR LIBERALITY
AND WOUNDED HIM SO SERIOUSLY THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE AT ANOTHER TIME ONE OF THE OVERSEERS BEAT AND KICKED A SLAVE TO DEATH THIS BARBARITY CAUSED THE MISTRESS TO BE VERY MUCH STIRRED UP
OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS CHEERFULLY OFFERED FOR THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE I MUST PAY SOME REASONABLE SUM FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE CITY AND SUSTENANCE WHILE HERE IT CANNOT BE MUCH
WITH THE INDIAN'S AVERSION TO SLAVERY TURNER WHO WAS A FELLOW PASSENGER WITH HENRY ARRIVED ALSO FROM RICHMOND HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY ONE A BRIGHT SMART PREPOSSESSING YOUNG MAN
SO AFTER HAVING ATTENDED TO ALL HIS DISAGREEABLE DUTIES HE MADE HIS GRAB AND GOT A HAND FULL HE DID NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW IT WOULD HOLD OUT THAT EVENING INSTEAD OF PARTICIPATING WITH THE GAY DANCERS
AS IT IS NOW NEAR ONE O'CLOCK AND I MUST ATTEND TO BUSINESS BUT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN HALF WHAT I INTENDED TO AS TIME IS SHORT HOPING TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON I REMAIN YOURS SINCERELY JOHN HALL
I RECOLLECT THAT ONE MORNING ON REACHING MY OFFICE THAT OF THE TREASURER OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION MY ASSISTANT TOLD ME THAT IN THE INNER ROOM WERE EIGHTEEN FUGITIVES MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAD ARRIVED THAT MORNING FROM THE SOUTH IN ONE COMPANY
HE LEFT HIS WIFE JULIA WHO WAS FREE SYDNEY HOPKINS AND HENRY WHEELER THESE YOUNG MEN MADE THEIR WAY OUT OF SLAVERY TOGETHER WHILE SYDNEY LIVES HE WILL FOREVER REGARD JACOB HOAG
ONE DAY SHE BEGAN SCOLDING AND SAID THE KITCHEN WASN'T KEPT CLEAN I TOLD HER THE KITCHEN WAS KEPT AS CLEAN AS ANY KITCHEN IN THE PLACE SHE SPOKE VERY ANGRY AND SAID SHE DIDN'T GO BY OTHER FOLKS
BUT DID NOT LEAVE THE SAME KIND PROTECTOR GEORGE WAS A FULL BLACK ORDINARY SIZE
IN NOVEMBER PREVIOUS TO WILLIAM'S ESCAPE HER LONG LOOKED FOR DISSOLUTION TOOK PLACE EVERY BONDMAN WHO WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REALIZE THE NATURE AND IMPORT OF THE CHANGE FELT A GREAT ANXIETY TO LEARN WHAT THE WILL OF THEIR OLD MISTRESS SAID
HE UNDERTOOK TO BEAT ME WITH THE LIMB OF A CHERRY TREE HE BEGAN AT ME AND TRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SNATCH MY CLOTHES OFF BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED
HE LEFT AS HE DID HIS WIFE IN SLAVERY HE DECLARED THAT HE STUCK TO THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD GEORGE E SADLER THE KEEPER OF AN OYSTER HOUSE HELD THE DEED FOR JOE
WHICH ADDS TO THE DIFFICULTY OF REMOVAL SHE IS SOME TEN OR TWELVE MILES FROM THE CITY SO THAT REALLY THE CHIEF HAZARD WILL BE IN BRINGING HER SAFELY TO TOWN AND IN SECRETING HER
I KEEP MY HANDS CLEAR OF ANY SUCH WICKED OR ILLEGAL ACT YOURS VERY TRULY J B WILL YOU RECOLLECT HEREAFTER THAT IN ANY OF MY FUTURE LETTERS IN WHICH I MAY USE
THAT THE SOONER SUCH ARTICLES WERE TURNED INTO CASH THE BETTER THIS IN SUBSTANCE WAS THE WAY JACK ACCOUNTED FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH HAD COME OVER HIS MASTER
OR AT LEAST LEND IT I WISH HERE TO CAUTION YOU AGAINST THE SUPPOSITION THAT I WOULD DO ANY ACT OR SAY A WORD TOWARDS HELPING SERVANTS TO ESCAPE ALTHOUGH I HATE SLAVERY SO MUCH
THEY WERE ABOUT SECOND CLASS IN SOCIETY HE AND HIS SISTER OWN WELL ON TO ONE HUNDRED HEAD THOUGH WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS HE HAS BEEN THINNING OFF THE NUMBER BY SALE I WAS ALLOWED ONE DOLLAR A WEEK FOR MY BOARD
BLOODHOUNDS AND CRUEL OVERSEERS LOOMED UP BEFORE HIM AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER THE DANGER HE IMMEDIATELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD MAKE A STRUGGLE COST WHAT IT MIGHT
MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR
AND WHEN THEY DID SO REQUESTED PARTICULARLY THAT THE BUNDLES OR BOXES SHOULD NOT BE MARKED FROM A TAPPAN AND CO AS WAS CUSTOMARY SOUTHERN MERCHANTS ESPECIALLY AVOIDED THEM
THEN AGAIN SOME DIDN'T LIKE HIM HE WAS A MEAN MAN ALL FOR HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN THAT DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SERVANTS EXCEPT TO GET WORK OUT OF THEM WHEN HE CAME WHERE THE SERVANTS WERE WORKING
MARY ARRIVED WITH HER TWO CHILDREN IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY THREE YEARS OF AGE QUITE TALL WITH A COUNTENANCE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE WELL FITTED TO AWAKEN SYMPATHY AT FIRST SIGHT
AND DOUBTLESS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF BEHAVING HIMSELF HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK HAVING BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES AND HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CRUEL MASTER EACH TIME
I MUST GO BACK BY GOOD RIGHTS TO THE BEGINNING AND TELL ALL SCOTT BOUGHT ME FIRST FROM A YOUNG MAN HE MET ONE DAY IN THE ROAD WITH A BUNDLE IN HIS ARMS SCOTT
AND AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN GOD AS HER ONLY TRUST SHE CONNECTED HERSELF WITH THE A M E BETHEL CHURCH OF PHILADELPHIA WHERE SHE HAS WALKED BLAMELESS
AND LOOKED LIKE A MAN CONDEMNED TO BE HUNG THEN SHE WHIPPED ME WITH THE COWHIDE UNTIL I SUNK TO THE FLOOR HE THEN BEGGED HER TO QUIT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE SHE HAS BEGGED AND BEGGED AND YOU HAVE WHIPPED HER ENOUGH
COMING BY FREE COLORED CHILDREN WITHOUT BUYING THEM AND SELLING THEM AFTERWARDS
THE HOPE OF FREEDOM HOWEVER BUOYED UP THE HEART OF THE YOUNG SLAVE GIRL DURING THE LONG MONTHS OF ANXIOUS WAITING AND DAILY EXPECTATION FOR THE HOUR OF DELIVERANCE TO COME
IT WILL BE REPEATED SOON AND YOU SHALL KNOW THE RESULT WHORRA FOR JUDGE KANE I FEEL SO INDIGNANT AT THE MAN THAT IT IS NOT EASY TO WRITE THE FOREGOING SENTENCE AND YET
BOTH WERE COMFORTED BY STRONG FAITH IN GOD AND BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD ENABLE THEM TO HOLD OUT ON THE ROAD UNTIL THEY SHOULD REACH FRIENDS HENRY SMALLWOOD SAW THAT HE WAS WORKING EVERY DAY FOR NOTHING AND THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD DO BETTER HE DESCRIBED HIS MASTER WASHINGTON BONAFONT
THE ORDER OF THE DAY WAS LITERALLY AS FAR AS COLORED MEN WERE CONCERNED NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT CHASKEY BROWN WM HENRY WASHINGTON JAMES ALFRED FRISLEY
PROVIDING THE SHIPPING MASTER COULD HAVE IT IN READINESS TO SUIT THEIR CONVENIENCE BUT AS THESE CAPTAINS HAD A NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENTS AT RICHMOND
ROBERT WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN AND FROM LONG AND DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE SLAVE PRISON HE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS AS A PENNSYLVANIA FARMER WITH HIS BARN YARD STOCK
IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AS IT WAS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE TO ASSIST ALL NEEDY FUGITIVES WHO MIGHT IN ANY WAY MANAGE TO REACH PHILADELPHIA BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS
IT MUST BE SO FOR YOU AND ME GIVE ME YOUR HAND JULIA FOR I HAVE NEVER DECEIVED YOU AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR THAT I SHALL DO SO NOW GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND SAY THAT YOU WILL BE MY WIFE NO HARRY NOT YOUR WIFE I DO NOT AS YOU SAY
THAT LADY CLAVERING WAS NOT TO COME TO LONDON AT ALL AND THAT SIR HUGH WAS MEDITATING WHETHER THE HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE MIGHT NOT BE LET THE ARRANGEMENT WOULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE OF CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN A THOUSAND A YEAR TO HIM
AND IN THAT CASE SHE SHALL BE MARRIED AT CLAVERING HERE WAS A PROSPECT FOR JULIA BRABAZON TO BE LED TO THE SAME ALTAR AT WHICH SHE HAD MARRIED LORD ONGAR BY ARCHIE CLAVERING TWELVE MONTH'S AFTER HER FIRST HUSBAND'S DEATH
AS FOR MARRIAGE I WOULD SOONER MARRY THE FIRST PLOUGHBOY I COULD FIND IN THE FIELDS
HE IS SO PRETTY AS HE LIES IN HIS LITTLE BED I THOUGHT YOU WOULD COME WITH ME TO SEE HIM HE WAS MORE GENTLE WITH HER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND SHE LED HIM AWAY TO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN THEIR OWN AND IN WHICH THE CHILD HAD DIED
BAD ALAS WAS THE BEST BUT IT WAS OF NO AVAIL NOW TO THINK OF THAT JULIA HE SAID BETWEEN US AT LEAST THERE SHALL BE NOTHING TO BE FORGIVEN
IF I WOULD NOT BECOME HIS WIFE SUGGESTED SOPHIE EXACTLY IT WAS VERY FLATTERING ON HIS PART I CERTAINLY DO NOT INTEND TO BECOME HIS WIFE AH YOU LIKE BETTER THAT YOUNG CLAVERING WHO HAS THE OTHER SWEETHEART
DEAR HUGH I LOVE YOU SO TRULY THIS IS NONSENSE SAID HE SHEER NONSENSE HIS VOICE WAS LOW AND VERY HOARSE WHY DO YOU TALK OF KINDNESS NOW
HE WAS ALWAYS POOR AND SICKLY THE CLAVERINGS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN SO STRONG LOOK AT MYSELF AND ARCHIE AND MY SISTERS WELL IT CANNOT BE HELPED THINKING OF IT WILL NOT BRING HIM BACK AGAIN YOU HAD BETTER TELL SOME ONE TO GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
NO I THINK NOT I SHALL WISH TO MAKE HER TAKE SOMETHING AND I CAN DO IT BETTER IF I ASK FOR TEA FOR MYSELF I WILL GO AT ONCE POOR DEAR LITTLE BOY IT WAS A BLOW I ALWAYS FEARED
EARLY ONE MORNING MISSUS CLAVERING AT THE RECTORY RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM LADY CLAVERING BEGGING THAT SHE WOULD GO UP TO THE HOUSE AND ON ARRIVING THERE SHE FOUND THAT THE POOR CHILD WAS VERY ILL
SOPHIE HERSELF MIGHT ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF TO BE WRONG BEGGING PARDON AND WEEPING ON HER FRIEND'S NECK PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE SOME FURTHER CALCULATION IN BED THEN SOPHIE SOFTLY DRAWING THE NOTES TOWARD HER
THAT COMES OF BRINGING ME HERE HE SAID GET UP HERMIONE I WILL NOT HAVE YOU SO FOOLISH GET UP I SAY I WILL HAVE THE ROOM CLOSED TILL THE MEN COME OH NO GET UP I SAY AND COME AWAY
AND THE POSITION ALSO OF THE DIVINE JULIA SOPHIE HINTED HER FEAR OF ANOTHER CLAVERING LOVER WHAT DID ARCHIE THINK OF HIS COUSIN HARRY WHY HE'S ENGAGED TO ANOTHER GIRL SAID ARCHIE
FANNY WAS NOW A LITTLE CONFUSED SO THAT SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY CALCULATE WHAT ALL THIS MEANT MISTER SAUL WALKED ON BY HER SIDE AND FOR SOME MOMENTS NOTHING WAS SAID
BUT HE KNEW WELL WHAT WAS THE TRUTH REQUIRED OF HIM LIES CAN BE ACTED AS WELL AS TOLD HARRY TELL ME ALL AT ONCE WHO IS FLORENCE BURTON WHO AND WHAT SHE KNEW IT ALL THEN
I CALL UPON YOU TO ANSWER ME THAT QUESTION TRULY AND IF YOU TELL ME THAT IT COULD BE SO I WILL NOT DESPAIR AND I WILL NOT GO AWAY AS HE SAID THIS THEY CAME TO A TURN IN THE ROAD
AND HAD RETURNED TO ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS LESS PERFECT THAN SHE BUT WHO IN OLD DAYS AS SHE WELL KNEW HAD BEEN HIS FIRST LOVE YES HE WOULD SAY ALL THIS AND JULIA
SAID THE RECTOR TO HIS DAUGHTER AS SOON AS HIS WIFE HAD LEFT THEM INDEED I KNEW THAT IT WAS COMING AND SHE WAS ALWAYS FEARING IT SAID FANNY BUT I DO NOT THINK HE DID HE NEVER SEEMS TO THINK THAT EVIL WILL COME TO HIM
WHEN SHE LEFT COUNT PATEROFF AT THE LITTLE FORT ON THE CLIFF AND ENTERED BY HERSELF THE GARDENS BELONGING TO THE HOTEL HAD LONG SINCE MADE UP HER MIND
CAN'T SAY I'M SURE SAID SIR HUGH BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T LIKE IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T TROUBLE MYSELF ABOUT THAT JUDGE NOT THAT YOU BE NOT JUDGED
AND WAS WAXING ANGRY AND BECOMING BITTER TOWARD HIM BECAUSE HE CAME NOT SIR HUGH CLAVERING WAS NOW IN LONDON AND WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER ARCHIE SIR HUGH WAS A MAN WHO STRAINED AN INCOME THAT WAS HANDSOME AND SUFFICIENT FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING ANY NUMBER OF LIES I DID NOT WRITE THE BOOK
ALL OTHERS WHOM HE REGARDED WOULD REVILE HIM AND NOW HE MUST LIVE FOR THIS WOMAN ALONE SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE HAD INJURED HIM YES INDEED SHE HAD INJURED HIM
AND AS HE ENTERED PICCADILLY HE WAS RACKED WITH DOUBTS BUT INSTEAD OF SETTLING THEM IN HIS MIND HE UNCONSCIOUSLY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO DWELL UPON THE WORDS WITH WHICH HE WOULD SEEK TO EXCUSE HIS TREACHERY TO FLORENCE HE THOUGHT HOW HE WOULD TELL HER
AND WHO WOULD CERTAINLY FIND NO PLACE FOR SOPHIE GORDELOUP WITHIN HIS HOUSE MIGHT IT NOT BE WELL THAT THE QUARREL SHOULD BE CONSUMMATED NOW SUCH COMPENSATION BEING OBTAINED AS MIGHT POSSIBLY BE EXTRACTED SOPHIE CERTAINLY KNEW A GOOD DEAL
UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF IT SO YOU WILL FIND NO COMFORT AND I EXPECT NONE SO THERE IS AN END OF THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE THINK OF THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY YOU KNOW AND IT IS OF NO MORE USE FOR ME TO BOTHER YOU
THUS WRITING IN HIS MIND THAT LETTER TO FLORENCE WHICH HE KNEW IF HE WERE AN HONEST MAN HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIMSELF TO WRITE HE REACHED LADY ONGAR'S DOOR WITHOUT HAVING ARRANGED FOR HIMSELF ANY SPECIAL LINE OF CONDUCT
AND THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER BEDROOM BUT IN A SMALL SITTING ROOM WHICH SHE GENERALLY USED WHEN SIR HUGH WAS NOT AT THE PARK
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND ALMOST TREMBLING AND SHE REPEATED THE WORDS AS THOUGH THEY WERE A TASK WHICH SHE HAD SET HERSELF THAT'S ALL VERY WELL IN ITS WAY SAID HE BUT WHAT'S THE SPECIAL USE OF IT NOW
EITHER OF LADY ONGAR OR OF HER LATE HUSBAND AT THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN DOWN TO ONGAR PARK ON THAT MISSION WHICH HAD BEEN AS WE KNOW FUTILE BUT HE SAID NO WORD OF THAT TO HARRY HE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS DINNER THOROUGHLY AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE
I GRIEVE FOR YOU I GRIEVE FOR YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART YES SAID HUGH IT HAS BEEN A HEAVY BLOW SIT DOWN UNCLE THERE IS A CLEAN GLASS THERE OR ARCHIE WILL FETCH YOU ONE
BUT IT IS MY ONE GREAT HOPE AS REGARDS THIS WORLD THAT I SHOULD HAVE YOU AT SOME FUTURE DAY AS MY OWN IT MAY BE THAT I AM TOO PRONE TO HOPE BUT SURELY IF THAT WERE ALTOGETHER BEYOND HOPE
AND WITH HONEST CLEAR TRUTH TO JULIA HALF HIS MISERY ROSE FROM THIS FEELING OF SELF ABASEMENT AND FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS WEAK PITEOUSLY WEAK
THAT YOU CAN GO TO HER AT ONCE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY THAT GIRL THAT HARRY HAS IN TOW MAY PERHAPS KEEP HIM AWAY FOR SOME TIME I TELL YOU WHAT HUGH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL WITH ME THE FIRST TIME
SHE COULD HEAR THE MOVEMENT OF THE OLD WOMAN AS SHE GENTLY TREMBLINGLY AS LADY CLAVERING KNEW MADE HER WAY DOWN THE HALL TO MEET HER MASTER SIR HUGH OF COURSE HAD LEARNED HIS CHILD'S FATE ALREADY FROM THE SERVANT WHO HAD MET HIM
FANNY TOLD HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD FROM STRATTON TWO DAYS SINCE AND THAT FLORENCE WAS WELL I LIKED HER VERY MUCH SAID MISTER SAUL SO DID WE ALL SHE IS COMING HERE AGAIN IN THE AUTUMN SO IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG BEFORE YOU SEE HER AGAIN
YOU CAN GO TO MOUNT STREET AND SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED THERE IS THE CARD AND NOW WE WILL SMOKE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT WITH GOOD BREEDING DETAIN THE COUNT ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR LED THE WAY INTO THE SMOKING ROOM
NOR COULD SHE BRING HERSELF TO THINK THAT SHE COULD BE QUITE CONTENTED WITH A LOVER SUCH AS MISTER SAUL WHEN HE HAD FIRST PROPOSED TO HER SHE HAD ALMOST RIDICULED HIS PROPOSITION IN HER HEART
NOT TO HER FACE WITH SPOKEN WORDS FOR THAT HE COULD NOT DO BUT WITH WRITTEN SKILL THAT HE WAS UNWORTHY OF HER GOODNESS THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER HAD FALLEN OFF THROUGH HIS OWN UNWORTHINESS
I DO NOT LIVE IN MOUNT STREET I HAVE MY ADDRESS SOMETIMES AT HER HOUSE MADAME GORDELOUP YES MADAME GORDELOUP SHE IS LADY ONGAR'S FRIEND SHE WILL TALK TO YOU WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME COUNT PATEROFF OH NO IT IS NOT NECESSARY
YOU GO AT EIGHT VERY WELL AND WHO WILL PAY FOR THE BEELS WHEN YOU ARE GONE LADY ONGAR I
HE JUST HEARD THE SOB WHICH HAD COST HER SO GREAT AND VAIN AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN IN AN INSTANT HE WAS KNEELING AT HER FEET AND GRASPING AT THE HAND WITH WHICH SHE WAS HIDING HER FACE JULIA HE SAID LOOK AT ME
CONTROLLED BY A SWITCH FROM MISTER DARCY'S TABLE WERE SO ARRANGED THAT HE MIGHT SHOCK HIS COUSIN OR ANY ONE WHO PUT HIS HANDS ON THE SHOWCASE AND THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ARGUE THAT HE PLANNED THIS TO MAKE HER INSENSIBLE FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES
THIS WAS THE EASIER FOR HER SINCE SHE OWNED THE BUILDING IN WHICH HER DISPLAY WAS KEPT AND LIVED IN A QUIET AND TASTEFULLY FURNISHED APARTMENT OVER THE STORE ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND SHE HAD SENT FOR HIS SECOND COUSIN
I CAME HERE PREPARED TO PAY ANY REASONABLE AMOUNT AND THE MERCHANT DREW OUT HIS WALLET THE COLONEL HELD UP A PROTESTING HAND PLEASE DON'T NOT YET HE SAID I CAN NOT ACCEPT A RETAINING FEE UNTIL I HAVE HEARD MORE OF YOUR CASE
MAYBE I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ALREADY OBSERVED CARROLL OH YES MAYBE AND THEN AGAIN MAYBE NOT COME ON
AND THE DETECTIVE FLICKED THE ASHES FROM A CIGAR THE REPORTER HAD GIVEN HIM DALEY WAS DOWN IN THE JEWELRY STORE INTERVIEWING THE CLERKS WHILE DARCY WAS ON THE GRILL UP ABOVE THE WATCH MURMURED DARCY IT IT'S IN HER HAND
NOT AT ALL LIKE THAT SAID DARCY AND THERE WAS THE TRACE OF A SMILE ON HIS FACE HE IS A GENTLEMAN OH SAID CARROLL AND THONG IN UNISON THERE CAME ANOTHER KNOCK ON THE SIDE DOOR DOWNSTAIRS
AND DARCY SEEMED A BIT CONFUSED A POINT NOT LOST SIGHT OF BY CARROLL
VERY WELL HIS CHIEF ANXIETY IS REGARDING YOU I REALIZE THIS IS A TEST OF FRIENDSHIP MISS MASON A TEST OF BOTH THE LOYALTY OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FATHER AND
THERE WAS A WORLD OF MEANING IN THAT EXCLAMATION AARON GRAFTON TURNED A DEEP RED AND BIT HIS LIPS
A PLACE INTO WHICH NEITHER OF THE DETECTIVES HAD AS YET GLANCED DOCTOR WARREN UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION AND DREW OUT A METAL STATUE ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH IT WAS THAT OF A HUNTER STANDING AS THOUGH HE HAD JUST DELIVERED A SHOT AND WAS PEERING TO SEE THE EFFECT
THE SAME ELECTRIC WIRES ON THE SHOWCASE THAT SHOCKED MISS BRILL THE OTHER DAY THE ELECTRICIANS HAD BEEN TOLD TO REMOVE THEM BUT HAD NOT YET DONE SO BUT I THOUGHT THOSE WIRES WERE DEAD CUT AFTER THE OTHER ACCIDENT MISTER KETTRIDGE
AN ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S WORK BENCH YES COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF I'VE SENT FOR THE ELECTRICIAN TO COME AND RIP OUT EVERYTHING I'LL HAVE THE PLACE ALL WIRED OVER IT WAS A MAKESHIFT JOB TO BEGIN WITH
AND PERHAPS LARCH ISN'T SO BAD A CHAP AS YOU'D HAVE ME BELIEVE TRUST A DISGRUNTLED LOVER FOR SAYING THE WORST ABOUT THE OTHER CHAP YES I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
WHEN I FOUND I NEEDED HELP IT WASN'T MUCH JUST THE LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS THAT A WOMAN CAN DO BETTER THAN A MAN WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THINGS LOOK FANCY I MIGHT HAVE TELEPHONED FOR MISS BRILL
THE BUTT OF HIS GUN PROJECTED BEHIND HIM AND AS DOCTOR WARREN MOVED THE STATUE INTO THE LIGHT OF THE JEWELRY STORE CHANDELIERS THEY ALL SAW CLINGING TO THE STOCK OF THE GUN SOME STRAGGLING WHITE HAIRS THAT'S WHAT DID IT EXCLAIMED THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN
A SUFFICIENT HISTORY OF HIMSELF AND HIS RELATIVE AND HAD HASTILY GONE OVER SUCH OF THE STOCK AS WAS KEPT OUTSIDE THE SAFE THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN FORCED OPEN IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO ASCERTAIN THAT IS ANYTHING GONE I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN
AND IT WAS WHILE WE WERE OUT TOGETHER THAT THE CROSS SHE WAS WEARING BECAME UNFASTENED AND FELL I MOST CLUMSILY STEPPED ON IT GREATLY MARRING THE SETTING SHE WAS DISTRESSED OF COURSE BUT I SAID I WOULD TAKE IT TO A JEWELER'S AND HAVE IT REPAIRED WITHOUT ANY ONE BEING THE WISER
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU GOT TO TAKE HER AWAY FALTERED DARCY
HE HAS DONE BUSINESS WITH ME FOR SOME YEARS IS HE ALL RIGHT SAFE NOT ONE OF THEM GARS YOU KNOW THE FELLOWS THAT USE A SILK CORD TO STRANGLE YOU WITH ASKED THONG WHO HAD SOME IMAGINATION REGARDING GARROTERS
NOTHING VERY COMPLICATED OR TROUBLESOME IN THAT I SUPPOSE THE CROSS WAS STOLEN FROM YOU WHILE IT WAS TEMPORARILY IN YOUR POSSESSION AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO LET YOUR FRIEND KNOW FOR FEAR SHE MAY SUSPECT YOU SUCH THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR THE LATEST DEBUTANTE A WATCH FOR SON ATTAINING HIS MAJORITY OR PERHAPS NEW GOLD GLASSES FOR GRANDPAPA OR GRANDMAMA THE STORE WAS NOT A LARGE ONE AND FOUR CLERKS ONE A YOUNG WOMAN
ASKED THE PHYSICIAN SHARPLY USE THE STATUE THAT WAY WHY NOT
AND HE'S WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE JEWELRY SHOP AND ISN'T NOW WHAT IS IT THIS VERY EVIDENTLY WAS SOMETHING FOR COLONEL ASHLEY TO DISCOVER AND WITH ALL HIS SKILL HE SET HIMSELF TO THIS TASK
AND THE COLONEL ASSUMED THE MILITARY APPEARANCE THAT SO WELL BEFITTED HIM STOP WORRYING I'LL TRY COLONEL DON'T TRY DO IT ONE QUESTION WELL ONE ONLY WHAT IS IT DO YOU THINK MISTER GRAFTON
IT WOULD BE A RATHER GREWSOME OBJECT TO HAVE AROUND AFTER IT HAD KILLED THE OLD LADY MURMURED THE REPORTER BUT ARE YOU SURE IT DID DOC PRETTY SURE YES I NEVER MAKE A STATEMENT THOUGH UNTIL AFTER THE AUTOPSY NO TELLING WHAT THAT MAY DEVELOP
AS HIS CALLER LOOKED A BIT SURPRISED OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WELL THIS WAS MISSUS LARCH'S CROSS IT IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM I BELIEVE THOUGH MANY SUPPOSE HER HUSBAND GAVE IT TO HER FOR A WEDDING PRESENT
AND CAREFULLY TRYING TO BALANCE HIMSELF HE REACHED FORWARD AS THOUGH TO TAKE THE STAINED DAGGER FROM THE HAND OF THE DETECTIVE YOU GOT PEARL'S NAME GRAVED ON IT DARCY OLE MAN ASKED KING THICKLY LICKING HIS HOT AND FEVERISH LIPS
THE DIAMOND CROSS COLONEL ASHLEY THERE WAS A FORMAL QUESTIONING NOTE IN THE MERCHANT'S VOICE THAT IS MY NAME YES SIR ER MISTER
SO DARCY'S JEWELRY STORE WAS KNOWN AND THOUGH A BIT OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY WAS FAVORABLY KNOWN NOT ONLY TO THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE RICH FAMILIES OF THE PLACE BUT TO THE YOUNGER SET AS WELL THE PRETTY GIRLS AND THEIR WELL GROOMED COMPANIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY BALL SET
THREE OR FOUR MURMURED THONG YES THREE ANYHOW MAYBE FOUR SOMETHING AWAKENED ME SUDDENLY BUT WHAT I CAN'T SAY I REMEMBER AT THE TIME IT FELT AS THOUGH SOMETHING HAD PASSED OVER MY FACE
IT WAS A SKILFUL BIT OF SHADOWING THE DETECTIVE DID ON THE JOURNEY TO THE METROPOLIS SO SKILFUL THAT THOUGH THE MERCHANT PLAINLY SHOWED BY HIS NERVOUSNESS THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED HE DID NOT SEEMINGLY SUSPECT THE QUIET MAN SEATED NOT FAR FROM HIM
THE ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S TABLE WAS THE ANSWER I COULDN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAID MISTER KETTRIDGE SAID CARROLL AND I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE TRIED NOT TO IF I COULD THIS IS IMPORTANT I RATHER GUESS IT MAKES IT LOOK A BIT BAD FOR YOUR FRIEND COLONEL ASHLEY
THE WORDS WERE AS CRISP AS THE STEEL OF THE STAINED BLADE DARCY STARED AT THE KEEN KNIFE AND THEN AT THE DEAD WOMAN WHO OWNS IT AND THE QUESTION SNAPPED LIKE A WHIP I DON'T IT WAS LEFT HERE BY
AND HE NODDED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SILENT FIGURE DOWNSTAIRS THE WATCH THAT IS STILL TICKING YES
AND OF COURSE YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE I NEVER COULD PLAN TO INJURE SALLIE PAGE THAT WAY OR THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN THE OTHER DAY
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET I BELIEVE
AGREED THE DETECTIVE WELL I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO WORK ON THE MURDER CASE BUT AS I AM ALREADY ENGAGED ON THAT TO TRY TO CLEAR DARCY I CAN AS WELL INCLUDE THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY ALSO
THE DAY MISSUS DARCY WAS KILLED I DON'T REMEMBER SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED THERE WERE SO MANY IN THE PLACE AS I THINK BACK THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM
PERHAPS I HAVE ACTED FOOLISHLY BUT OF LATE I HAVE SEEN HER QUITE OFTEN I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HER MARRIED LIFE WAS NOT HAPPY I TOOK PAINS TO ENQUIRE AND LEARNED THAT IT WAS NOT
HE WAS SMILING AND CHEERFUL WAS DOCTOR WARREN MURDERS AND AUTOPSIES WERE ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WITH HIM HE HAD BEEN COUNTY PHYSICIAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HUM YES QUITE AN OLD LADY HE MUSED AS HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT WHICH CARROLL HELD FOR HIM
AND THE STOPPING OF THE CLOCKS COULD YOUR APPARATUS HAVE DONE THAT NEVER IT IS TRUE A STRONG ELECTRICAL CURRENT MIGHT
FOLLOW THAT TAXI THE COLONEL ORDERED THE DRIVER OF HIS MACHINE AS IT ROLLED OUT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION JUST A FEW LENGTHS BEHIND THE ONE IN WHICH GRAFTON RODE
IT MAY BE THAT I CAN NOT SERVE YOU GIVE ME SOME INKLING OF WHAT YOU WANT I HOPE YOU ARE NOT IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IT IS SERIOUS FOR ME THEN I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU PLEASE BE AS FRANK AS YOU THINK BEST
BUT NOW OH I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT IN THE HOUSE I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT IT NOR COULD SHE SHE WE WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED CARROLL QUICKLY SAY DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS KILLING THAT YOU'RE KEEPING BACK FROM US HE TOOK A STEP NEARER DARCY
HOW ABOUT HAVING HIS WATCH REPAIRED I'D REMEMBER I THINK IF I HAD FIXED HIS WATCH I'M SURE I DIDN'T HE HAS A FINE ONE FOR I'VE SEEN HIM STOP IN FRONT OF OUR WINDOW AND COMPARE HIS TIME WITH OUR CHRONOMETER I SEE NOW ANOTHER MATTER
NOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL WORLD AND THE GOOD BIRDS SANG HAPPILY AND REJOICED IN THE WORK WHICH THEY HAD HELPED AND IN THE SPARKLING WATER WHICH WAS SWEET TO THEIR TASTE ALL WERE HAPPY
WHEN ALL WAS READY SOLOMON WAS WONT TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS THRONE AND WOULD COMMAND THE WINDS TO DO THEIR DUTY
OH HOW HAPPY I AM BUT THE POOR BLINDWORM BLIND INDEED FROM THAT DAY FORTH BEGAN TO CRY AND LAMENT BEGGING THE NIGHTINGALE TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS EYE NAY SAID THE NIGHTINGALE
WHEN THERE WERE NO ROBINS IN THOSE DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE OJIBWAYS WHICH IS FAR IN THE NORTH OF THE COLD COUNTRY THERE LIVED AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO HAD ONE SON
NO STORMS EVER TROUBLED THE OCEAN AND MARINERS COULD SET OUT UPON THEIR VOYAGES WITHOUT FEAR FOR WHILE HIS LITTLE GRANDCHILDREN ROCKED IN THEIR BASKET THE GOOD KING A EOLUS
CHUCKLING OVER THE GREEDY FELLOW'S FAILURE
AND FAR FROM HIS DEAR WIFE
THEN THE BLINDWORM GREW VERY ANGRY I WILL GET THE EYE BACK HE CRIED I WILL STEAL IT FROM YOU AS YOU STOLE IT FROM ME SOME TIME WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP
SO IT WAS SAY THE MUSSULMANS THAT A BIRD TOLD SOLOMON OF THE GREAT QUEEN WHOSE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE
STRAIGHT TO THE WADY SHADY SWAMP WHERE MISS HERON WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG WAITING FOR HER SUPPER TO GET ITSELF CAUGHT AHEM CROAKED MISTER STORK WAVING HIS WING POLITELY GOOD EVENING MISS HERON
UNLESS FOR A VERY LITTLE WHILE YOU WISH TO FEEL SORRY LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS NEW THERE LIVED A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS NAMED
AS HER WINGS TOUCHED THE WET SHOULDERS
AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT SHE ROSE AND HASTENED TO THE SEASHORE TREMBLING WITH A HORRIBLE DREAD STANDING ON THE VERY SPOT WHENCE SHE HAD LAST SEEN THE FATED SHIP
HE HAS SHOWN PITY SEEING THAT I WAS OBEDIENT TO MY FATHER AND DID MY BEST TO PLEASE HIM NOW I AM TO BE NO LONGER AN INDIAN BOY I MUST TAKE THE SHAPE WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS GIVEN ME
THE LORD LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE FLOCKS OF NEWLY MADE BIRDS WHO WERE PREENING THEIR WINGS AND WONDERING AT THEIR OWN BRIGHT FEATHERS AND SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL MAKE THESE PRETTY CREATURES USEFUL
BUT TO BE JEERED AT BY THIS CREATURE IT IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR HA I HAVE AN IDEA I WILL PUNISH HIM AND HELP MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME I WILL STEAL HIS ONE EYE
SOME OF HER CLEVER QUESTIONS TO PROVE HIS WISDOM SO SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT HIS INVITATION AND COME TO JERUSALEM SHE CAME WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WITH CAMELS THAT BORE SPICES AND TREASURES OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
AND EURUS THE EAST WIND SOMETIMES INDEED A EOLUS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT FOR THE WINDS WOULD ESCAPE FROM HIS CONTROL AND RUSH OUT UPON THE SEA
KNOWING WELL THE CRUELTY OF THE WINDS
AND HIS EYES STUCK OUT OF HIS HEAD BUT HE SAID CARELESSLY IT IS A CROWN OF BRASS MY FRIEND I WILL GIVE YOU A QUARTER OF A SHEKEL FOR IT AND IF YOU FIND ANY MORE BRING THEM TO ME BUT
RETURN HERE TO ME AND I WILL HELP YOU YET AGAIN SO THE KING OF THE HOOPOES LEFT KING SOLOMON WITH A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SOON ALL THE HOOPOES WERE WEARING GOLDEN CROWNS THEREUPON
EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF OLD A EOLUS KING OF THE WINDS AND LIVED WITH HIM ON HIS HAPPY ISLAND WHERE IT WAS HIS CHIEF BUSINESS
A TALENT WAS WORTH THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS
PRAY HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF YES EXCLAIMED THE MISCHIEVOUS BAT HAVE YOU NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR OUR KIND HOST
SAYING WHAT A GREAT CHIEF HE WOULD BE IN THE DAYS TO COME BUT ON THE NINTH MORNING WHEN THE FATHER PEEPED INTO THE LODGE TO SEE HOW BRAVELY HIS SON WAS FARING THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE DOOR
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO THAT IN AFTER TIME MEN SHALL LOVE THEM DEARLY COME MY BIRDS HE CRIED COME HITHER TO ME AND WITH THE BEAKS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU HOLLOW ME OUT HERE AND HERE AND HERE
LET US KNOCK HERE SAID THE SHREWD BAT I KNOW THE OLD FELLOW IS NOT ASLEEP THIS IS HIS PROWLING HOUR AND BUT THAT IT IS A STORMY NIGHT HE WOULD BE ABROAD HUNTING WHAT HO MASTER OWL HE SQUEAKED
THE JOY OF LIFE WAS GONE SLOWLY THE SUN SANK TOWARDS THE HORIZON A RED EYE FIXED UPON THE PHOENIX STEADILY SUDDENLY ACROSS THE GRAY WASTE OF SAND DOTTED A BEAM OF LIGHT INTENSELY BRIGHT
WAS ALWAYS ESPECIALLY CAREFUL TO CHAIN UP IN PRISON THOSE WICKED BROTHERS THE WINDS
HE HOPPED AFTER HER AND PERCHING ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE PEERED DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TREE AND THERE HE SAW A GREAT HEAP OF SILVER AND GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES WHICH MOTHER MAGPIE WAS TRYING TO COVER WITH HER WINGS OH WHAT A TREASURE WHAT A TREASURE
HE BORE HIS HEAD HIGH WITH ITS BURDEN AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH PIOUS JOY IT WAS GOOD TO BE A PHOENIX GOOD GOOD AT LAST HE REACHED THE PLACE WHICH UNKNOWINGLY HE SOUGHT THE SUN ALONE HAD BEEN HIS GUIDE
SLEEPY TIME HE IS TOO LAZY TO WADDLE IN SEARCH OF A DINNER FAR FROM THE RIVER WHERE HE LIVES BUT ANY ANIMAL OR EVEN A MAN SWIMMER
AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY NEVER DREAMING THAT SHE WAS LONESOME FOR NO ONE HAD TOLD HER WHAT LONESOME WAS SHE LOVED TO GO WADING IN THE COOL WATERS SHE LOVED TO CATCH THE LITTLE FISH WHO SWAM BY UNSUSPECTINGLY WHILE SHE STOOD STILL UPON ONE LEG
IN THOSE DAYS THE NIGHTINGALE ALSO HAD BUT ONE EYE AS FOR THE BLINDWORM IT MATTERED VERY LITTLE FOR HE WAS A HOMELY CREATURE CONTENT TO CRAWL ABOUT IN THE DARK UNDERGROUND
YES HER MIND WAS MADE UP SHE WOULD INVITE HIM SHE GLANCED DOWN AT HER REFLECTION AND SETTLED SOME OF THE FEATHERS WHICH HER FIT OF TEMPER HAD RUFFLED OUT OF ORDER THEN OFF SHE STARTED IN PURSUIT OF MISTER STORK MISTER STORK HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR
HE PUT A PIECE OF BROKEN MIRROR INTO HIS TRAP AND A HOOPOE SPYING IT WENT IN TO ADMIRE HERSELF AND WAS CAUGHT THE FOWLER LOOKED AT THE SHINING CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE HERE
WHILE THE TRIBE PLANNED A FINE FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF THE YOUNG HERO EARLY ON THE MORROW
WITH A TERRIBLE ROAR THE DRAGON SNAPPED AT HIM AS WHITEBIRD POPPED THROUGH THE HOLE
FOR FIRST YOU MUST OFFER YOURSELF TO BE HIS SERVANT AND THEN HE WILL BE GENEROUS THEN HE WILL LET YOU CARRY AWAY AS MUCH TREASURE AS YOUR BEAK WILL HOLD THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT
NOR WERE THERE ANY HOLLOWS OR VALLEYS TO HOLD THE SEAS AND RIVERS FOUNTAINS AND POOLS WHICH THE WORLD OF MEN WOULD NEED IT MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN A STUPID AND UGLY EARTH IN THOSE DAYS WITH NO CHANCE FOR SWIMMING OR SAILING
UNTIL SHE WAS SO FAT THAT SHE COULD NOT RUN AWAY AT THE CROCODILE'S APPROACH SHE COULD ONLY STAND AND SQUAWK FEEBLY FLUTTERING HER RIDICULOUS WINGS BUT THE CROCODILE ONLY SAID
LIKE THESE YOU SEE HERE EACH CHAMBER IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE TEMPTING THAN THE LAST
TAKE THIS LETTER TO QUEEN BALKIS THEN COME AWAY THE HOOPOE DID AS HE WAS BID DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH LIKE AN ARROW AND THE NEXT DAY HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA WHERE SHE SAT
PICK PICK THE HEN BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND PECK UPON THE ROUGH BARK OF THE LOG
WHITEBIRD HOPPED IN EAGERLY AND AWAY BACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE CAVE HE FOUND A LITTLE ROUND HOLE AS THE MAGPIE HAD SAID A HOLE NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN AN APPLE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR FAT MOTHER MAGPIE WHITEBIRD HOPPED THROUGH THE HOLE
AND LIME ROCK GRAY THREW BACK THE RAY ACROSS THE RAPID FLOOD THOUGH COLD EACH FORM THEIR LOVE STILL WARM FROM HEARTH AND LATTICE GLOWS
SAID LITTLE UGLY COLDLY ENOUGH WHY NOT NO ANSWER TO BE SURE HE MIGHT HEAR HE WOULD FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE MUSICAL WHAT OF THAT
I BANISH ALL BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT FROM MY TABLE I STUDIOUSLY AVOID ALL NOTORIOUS FRESH AIR LOVERS OR TRY IN EVERY WAY TO BRING OVER THE POOR MISGUIDED MORTALS TO MY VIEWS BUT IT IS OF NO USE FRESH AIR IS THE FASHION
THOSE WINDOWS IN A DOUBLE ROW WITH THE GALLERY BETWEEN HOW REGULARLY I COUNTED THE SMALL PANES ALWAYS FORGETTING THE NUMBER TO MAKE THE SAME WEARY TASK NECESSARY EVERY SUNDAY THE SINGING SEATS
I BELIEVE I HAD MADE SOME LITTLE IMPRESSION SATURDAY NIGHT BUT HER OLD DISTRUST HAD COME BACK BY SUNDAY MORNING NOW SHE WAS AGAIN SHAKEN AT LAST
AND FOLLOWED IN SILENCE NATHAN SPRANG UPON THE SHED AT THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND SCRAMBLED UP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW MISTER DUDLEY FOLLOWED AND WITH NATHAN'S HELP GAINED THE SAME PRECARIOUS FOOTHOLD LOOK IN SIR
FAINTER NOW AND FARTHER THE TINY WAR WHOOP NOW I HEAR IT NOT A COWARDLY ASSASSIN HE HE WAITS FULL WELL AWARE THAT I AM ON THE ALERT WITH MURDEROUS INTENT
AND VIEWING THE HONEST SAILORS AS THEY PROMENADED UP AND DOWN THE STRING LADDERS AT THE COMMAND OF THEIR CAPTAINS MY FEARS WERE AROUSED BY A DISTANT COMMOTION I HASTILY TURNED AND LOOKED OVER THE RAILING INTO THE STREET
MY FRIEND ALWAYS CARRIED A SMALL THERMOMETER IN HER TRUNK WHICH SHE CONSULTED A DOZEN TIMES AN HOUR IN ORDER TO REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM ALAS FOR ME IF THE QUICKSILVER ROSE ABOVE SIXTY
WILL YOU LET ME CARRY BOTH THESE BASKETS THERE
I WERE LESS FATIGUED LESS SLEEPY SLEEP I INVOKE THEE COMFORTABLE BIRD THAT BROODEST O'ER THE TROUBLED WAVES OF LIFE AND HUSHEST THEM TO PEACE ALL HAIL THE MAN
AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
AND HE MIGHT BE SEEN ANY PLEASANT AFTERNOON IN SUMMER RIGGED OUT IN A HIDEOUS YELLOW CALICO ROBE OR BLOUSE WITH A DUSTY OLD BLACK STRAW HAT STUCK ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD HOEING AND DIGGING IN THAT BELOVED PATCH OF GROUND
NOW THIS INDEPENDENT YOUNG LADY SHALL BE AT LIBERTY TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF WITH NO OFFICIOUS INTERFERENCE OF MINE
SAID MISS ETTY SHYLY IT IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT I WAS URGING FLORA PLEASE TO LET ME HAVE THE BASKET
EVENING I AM BOOKED FOR A HORSEBACK RIDE WITH LITTLE HANDSOME TO MORROW MORNING HOW DID SHE MAKE ME OFFER I DID NOT MEAN TO ALL COUNTRY GIRLS RIDE I BELIEVE
LITTLE UGLY AGAIN NO I DID NOT REFER TO FLORA SAID SHE AS YOU SAY SHE CAN AVENGE HER OWN QUARREL AND WE BOTH WERE QUITE AS READY TO LAUGH AT YOU AS YOU COULD BE TO LAUGH AT US I ASSURE YOU
AND HALLOO SHALL BREAK THE TREACHEROUS SLUMBER FOR BEHOLD THE YOUTH COLLEGIATE SNIFF THE MORNING ZEPHYRS BREEZES OF BRISK DECEMBER FROSTY AND KEEN WITH NOSE INCARNADINE
ONE IN WHICH HUMILITY MINGLES WITH A MORE CORDIAL SELF RESPECT THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN CONSCIOUS OF I CAN AND I WILL DESERVE ETTY'S GOOD OPINION SHE IS AN UNCOMPROMISING JUDGE
JUST AS I LOVE HER HOMELY SINCERITY OF AFFECTION WHO ARRANGES THE GLASSES IN THE PARLOR ETTY I WOULD NOT FEAR TO AFFIRM FROM THE ASTERS AND GOLDEN ROD CHEEK BY JOLE WITH PETUNIAS AND CARNATIONS
JUST AS A STAY AT HOME WIFE LECTURES A GAY HUSBAND WHO NEVER RETURNS TO HIS BETTER HALF WHEN HE FINDS ANY THING TO AMUSE HIM ABROAD GOOD BY OLD FELLOW I HAVE FOUND BETTER COMPANY THAN YOUR REMEMBERINGS OR HOPINGS TO WIT
I RIDE IN THE OMNIBUS AND AM ALMOST CHOKED WITH MY BONNET STRINGS SUCH A FURIOUS DRAUGHT MEETS ME IN THE FACE AND WHEN WITH INFINITE PAINS I HAVE SECURED THE ONLY TOLERABLY WARM CORNER MY NEXT NEIGHBOR BECOMES VERY FAINT AND MUST HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN
T IS BUT THE EARLIEST THE WARNING PEAL HE SLEEPS AGAIN HAPPY IF BUSTLING CHUM FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE ENTRY OR PERCHANCE IN THE HOME BOWER MATERNAL KNOCK
THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR STANDING WITHOUT THE DOOR FOR A MOMENT AS IF TO ENJOY THE TRIUMPH OF THE WARMTH WITHIN HIM OVER THE COLD MORNING AIR THE LITTLE STONE CHURCH
WITHOUT ACCOMPANIMENT THE DESIRED SHARP RUNG UPON MY EARS AND SET MY NERVES AT REST BRAVO ENCORE I CRIED BENEATH THE WINDOW AND WAS PELTED
WHO FIRST INVENTED BED O WONDROUS SOFT THIS PILLOW TO MY WEARY HEAD RIGHT SOON MY DIZZY THOUGHTS SHALL O'ER THE BRINK OF SLEEP FALL INTO CHAOS AND BE LOST I DREAM
TANGLE HER FOOT IN THE STIRRUP OR RIDING SKIRT FAINT FALL BREAK HER NECK O HORRORS WILL NOT THE DEAR OLD AUNT TABITHA FORBID HER GOING WHAT A WELL PROPORTIONED AND LADYLIKE FIGURE IT WAS
HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
THE BELOVED MINISTER AND MANY MANY WHO SAT WITH TRUSTFUL AND DEVOTED HEARTS UNDER HIS TEACHINGS ARE GONE TO THEIR REWARD A BOARD FROM THE OLD PULPIT
ANGRY SHOUTS OF DROVERS HORRID MENACE AND DIRE CURSE SHRILL SCREAM OF IMITATIVE BOY
PEERING ABOVE EACH GRACEFUL SHEPHERD'S PLAID THE CHIN ENFOLDING SEE HOW THE PURPLE HUE OF YOUTH AND HEALTH GLOWS IN EACH CHEEK HOW THE SHARP WIND BRINGS PEARLS FROM EVERY EYE
I ADMIRE COWS IN THEIR PROPER PLACES THEY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY USEFUL ANIMALS SOME MAY THINK THEM HANDSOME AND GRACEFUL THIS IS AS YET AN UNSETTLED QUESTION
THAT I AM WASTED ALMOST TO A SHADOW AND FEARS ARE ENTERTAINED THAT I SHALL WHOLLY VANISH INTO THIN AIR MY PHYSICIAN TALKS GRAVELY ABOUT MY HAVING EXHAUSTED MY NERVOUS ENERGY AND SENDS ME TO RATBOROUGH
WITH ITS CAPACIOUS SQUARE PEWS IN WHICH HALF THE AUDIENCE TURNED THEIR BACKS UPON THE MINISTER THE SEATS MADE TO RISE AND FALL FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF STANDING
THIS HOUSE I'LL NEVER SERENADE AGAIN A DOG SHOULD KNOW MUSICIANS FROM SUSPICIOUS CHAPS AND GENTLEMEN FROM ROWDIES EVEN AT NIGHT BEAT HIM AGAIN NO NO PERHAPS T IS HERS
PROCLAIMS A COMING RAIN A WELCOME EVIL SURE WHEN STREETS ARE ONE LONG ASH HEAP AND THE FLOWERS FAINTING OR CRISP IN SUN BAKED BORDERS STAND MOUNT AUBURN'S GATE IS CLOSED
WHERE IS THE USE OF BEING ABLE TO SING TO SING ONLY WHEN THERE'S NOBODY TO LISTEN I SING ONLY TO FRIENDS I CANNOT SING I HAVE NEVER SUNG TO PERSONS IN WHOM I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE AFRAID
THE LATEST BUS DOWN BRATTLE STREET GOES RUMBLING LABORERS HIE HOME BY TWOS AND THREES HOMELIEST PHIZZES VOICES HIGH PITCHED AND TONGUES WITH TELLTALE BURR R R R THE SHORT STEMMED PIPE
NATHAN THOUGHT THAT IT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE SOFTENING TWILIGHT OF THE MORNING WHILE NATHAN STOOD MUSING WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE CHURCH
I COME FORWARD AS SHE COMES NEAR ON THAT RAT LIKE PONY OF HERS WHO HOLDS HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LOST IN THE ROAD I STAND IN DOUBT WHETHER TO LAUGH AT HER PREDICAMENT
NEITHER OF US OPENED THE PORTFOLIO SHE SEIZED HOWEVER BUT WATCHED ETTY'S EYES THEY WERE CAST DOWN WITH A DIFFIDENT BLUSH WHICH GAVE ME PAIN
THAT THE POWDER HORNS ON TOP OF THEIR HEADS EXPLODE AND SPREAD RUIN AND DESOLATION AROUND PEOPLE HERE BESTOW A VAST DEAL TOO MUCH CONSIDERATION ON THESE UNPLEASANT ANIMALS
WHEN SHE VANISHED FROM THE KITCHEN AS I ENTERED THE VOCIFEROUS MIRTH WHICH ATTRACTED ME WAS AT MY EXPENSE BEFORE FLORA COULD RECOGNIZE MY PORTRAIT LITTLE UGLY POUNCED UPON IT
WITH THE PREMEDITATED PURPOSE OF TANTALIZING HIM I SUPPOSE SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW HER POWER OVER HIM AND IT WAS NEVER GREATER THAN AT THIS MOMENT HER BEAUTY HAD ITS SWEETEST QUALITY
MODESTY I MIGHT SAY NEITHER THRIVES NOR IS USEFUL AT COURT WHEN BRANDON PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR HIS ENTRANCE WAS BARRED BUT HE QUICKLY PUSHED ASIDE THE HALBERDS AND ENTERED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
THE NOTE BEING THE CAUSE OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE IMPATIENTLY THREW TO THE FLOOR AGAIN AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW BENCH WHERE SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN TO POUT IN THE COURSE OF FIVE MINUTES SHE TURNED HER HEAD FOR ONE FLEETING INSTANT AND LOOKED AT THE NOTE AND THEN AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION
YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME TO IT AND TELL THE TRUTH THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE OUR SOCIETY AND SHE GAVE HIM A VICIOUS LITTLE GLANCE WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A SMILE IN GOD'S NAME LADY MARY THAT IS NOT IT ANSWERED BRANDON WHO WAS ON THE RACK
BUT JANE DID NOT AT FIRST TAKE THE HINT AND KEPT CLOSE AT HER HEELS MARY'S IMPULSIVE NATURE WAS NOT MUCH GIVEN TO HINTING SHE USUALLY NODDED AND MOST EMPHATICALLY AT THAT SO AFTER A FEW FAILURES TO RID HERSELF OF HER WAITING LADY
HE TURNED TO LEAVE AND THE LADIES INCLUDING JANE WHO WAS THERE AND SAW IT ALL AND TOLD ME OF IT AWAITED THE BOLT THEY KNEW WOULD COME FOR THEY SAW THE LIGHTNING GATHERING IN MARY'S EYES
THE MATTER WAS SETTLED BY MUTE BUT SATISFACTORY ARBITRATION AND BRANDON CONTINUED YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF READY TO GO ON DECK IT WILL BE HARD BUT IT MUST BE DONE HE HELPED HER WITH THE HEAVY JACK BOOTS AND HANDED HER THE RAIN STAINED SLOUCH HAT
YOU ARE THE ONLY GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT I DID ABOUT MY GIRTH BEING LOOSE AS TO THE NEW DANCE I DO NOT CARE TO LEARN IT BECAUSE I WOULD NOT DANCE IT WITH ANY MAN BUT YOU AND NOT EVEN WITH YOU YET
WERE TURNED OVER TO MARY WHO CARED VERY LITTLE WHO WAS OFFENDED OR WHO WAS NOT AND INVITATIONS TO THEM WERE HIGHLY VALUED ONE AFTERNOON A DAY OR TWO AFTER BRANDON'S PRESENTATION A MESSAGE ARRIVED FROM MARY NOTIFYING ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE FETE
THAT BRANDON STOOD UPON A FIRMER FOUNDATION WITH THIS CHANGING SHIFTING QUICKSAND OF A GIRL THAN WITH EITHER OF THEIR MAJESTIES IN FACT I THOUGHT HE RESTED UPON HER HEART ITSELF BUT TO GUESS CORRECTLY WHAT A GIRL OF THAT SORT WILL DO OR THINK
WOULD GO DOWN IN THE ATTEMPT HIS TROUBLE HOWEVER DID NOT MAKE A MOPE OF HIM AND HE RETAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS BRIGHTNESS AND SPARKLE UNDIMMED BY WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACHE IN HIS HEART THOUGH HE TRIED
MARY DID NOT COME HOME WITH US FROM WESTMINSTER THE MORNING AFTER THE JOUSTINGS AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT FOLLOWED SOME FOUR OR FIVE DAYS LATER
AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR HER SAKE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON TAKE HER ASHORE AT ONCE BRANDON SAW ONLY TOO PLAINLY THE TRUTH THAT HE HAD REALLY SEEN ALL THE TIME
MATTERS BEGAN TO LOOK DARK TO ME LOVE HAD DAWNED IN MARY'S BREAST THAT WAS SURE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH ALL ITS FIERCE SWEETNESS NOT THAT IT HAD REACHED ITS NOON OR ANYTHING LIKE IT
SO I COME TO YOU YOU WHO ARE THE GREAT CURE FOR ALL MY TROUBLES OH THAT I COULD LAY THEM HERE ALL MY LIFE LONG AND SHE PUT HER HEAD UPON HIS BREAST FORGETTING WHAT SHE HAD INTENDED TO SAY WHAT IS THE TROUBLE MARY
HE HAD SEEN IT ALL ONLY TOO CLEARLY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND HE HAD DELIBERATELY AND WITH OPEN EYES BROUGHT DISGRACE RUIN AND DEATH UNLESS HE COULD ESCAPE UPON HIMSELF AND UTTER HUMILIATION
SHE HAD NEVER SHOWN SO GREAT FAVOR TO ANY MAN AS TO BRANDON BUT JUST HOW MUCH OF HER CONDESCENSION WAS A MERE WHIM GROWING OUT OF THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT AND SUBJECT TO REACTION I COULD NOT TELL I BELIEVED HOWEVER
MY MISTRESS SHE ANSWERED NODDING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TWO RIDING AHEAD OF US I NEVER SAW HER SO MUCH INTERESTED IN ANY ONE AS SHE IS IN YOUR FRIEND MASTER BRANDON
BUT FIND A CONTINUAL TENDENCY ON THE PART OF MY OWN STORY TO INTRUDE FOR EVERY MAN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE TO HIMSELF I SHALL HOWEVER TRY TO KEEP IT OUT IN THE COURSE OF MY TALK WITH BRANDON
JANE ROSE PICKED UP THE NOTE AND OFFERED IT TO HER MISTRESS WHO SNATCHED IT WITH ONE HAND WHILE SHE GAVE HER A SHARP SLAP WITH THE OTHER JANE RAN OUT AND MARY FULL OF ANGER AND SHAME SLAMMED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
YOUR FACE IS A KILL MIRTH ANYWAY IT NEVER TOOK LONG TO ROUSE HER LADYSHIP THE QUEEN TURNED TO HENRY WHO WAS LAUGHING AND ANGRILY DEMANDED WILL YOUR MAJESTY PERMIT ME TO BE THUS INSULTED IN YOUR VERY PRESENCE
STOOD THERE LAUGHING TO HERSELF AT THIS BUCKINGHAM GREW FURIOUS AND RAN AROUND AHEAD OF BRANDON VALIANTLY DRAWING HIS SWORD NOW BY HEAVEN FELLOW MAKE BUT ANOTHER STEP AND I WILL RUN YOU THROUGH HE SAID I SAW IT ALL
BUT TO WHICH HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES AND THROWING MARY'S CLOAK OVER HER SHOULDERS PREPARED TO GO ASHORE AS THEY WENT OVER THE SIDE AND PULLED OFF A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP FROM THE SHIP FAR MORE DERISIVE THAN CHEERING
AFTER TWELVE HOURS OF FASTING AND EIGHT HOURS OF RIDING HER APPETITE SOON OVERCAME HER REPUGNANCE AND SHE ATE WITH A ZEST THAT WAS NEW TO HER THE HUMBLEST FARE THAT HAD EVER PASSED HER LIPS ONE OFTEN MISSES THE ZEST OF LIFE'S JOYS BY HAVING TOO MUCH OF THEM
THAT DAY OVER IN THE FOREST ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY BAD AND YOU HAVE ACTED ABOMINABLY EVER SINCE NOW IS NOT THAT KIND IN ME AND SHE SOFTLY LAUGHED AS SHE PEEPED UP AT THE POOR FELLOW FROM BENEATH THOSE SWEEPING LASHES
AND WAS SOON LOST TO SIGHT BEHIND THE SHRUBBERY AT THE TURNING OF THE WALK IN A SHORT TIME WE CAME TO A SUMMER HOUSE NEAR THE MARBLE BOAT LANDING
THAT ARE TIDY ENOUGH BUT THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD SELECTED FOR THAT REASON AND THE UNCLEANNESS WAS NOT THE LEAST OF MARY'S TRIALS THAT HARD NIGHT SHE HAD NOT TASTED FOOD SINCE NOON AND FELT THE KEEN HUNGER NATURAL TO YOUTH AND HEALTH SUCH AS HERS
BUT COULD HARDLY REALIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT CAME SO QUICKLY AND WAS OVER SO SOON LIKE A FLASH BRANDON'S SWORD WAS OUT OF ITS SHEATH AND BUCKINGHAM'S BLADE WAS FLYING TOWARD THE CEILING BRANDON'S SWORD WAS SHEATHED AGAIN SO QUICKLY THAT ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT HAD BEEN OUT AT ALL
YOU SEE SHE COULD ENJOY THIS NEW PLAYTHING AS WELL AS HER BROTHER BUT THE KING OF COURSE MUST BE SATISFIED FIRST THEY BOTH HAD ENOUGH EVENTUALLY HENRY IN ONE WAY MARY IN ANOTHER
BRANDON TOOK THE HINT AND MANAGED TO LET IT BE KNOWN TO HIS PLAY LOVING KING THAT HE KNEW THE LATEST FRENCH GAMES
AND TOLERANCE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT WE BELIEVED THAT THESE THINGS WOULD YET COME IN SPITE OF KINGCRAFT AND PRIESTCRAFT BUT WISELY KEPT OUR PET THEORIES TO OURSELVES
SHE KNEW HE WAS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL COMPANION SHE HAD EVER MET AND THAT THERE WAS AN EXHILARATION ABOUT HIS PRESENCE WHICH ALMOST INTOXICATED HER AND MADE LIFE AN ECSTASY YET SHE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS LOVE
ONE MUST WANT A THING BEFORE IT CAN BE APPRECIATED A HARD RIDE OF FIVE HOURS BROUGHT OUR TRAVELERS TO BATH WHICH PLACE THEY RODE AROUND JUST AS THE SUN BEGAN TO GILD THE TILE ROOFS AND STEEPLES
SOON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK MARY HAD NOT SEEN BRANDON FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS AND WAS GROWING ANXIOUS WHEN ONE DAY SHE AND JANE MET HIM IN A FOREST WALK NEAR THE RIVER BRANDON WAS SAUNTERING ALONG READING WHEN THEY OVERTOOK HIM
BRANDON STARTED OFF AND SOON FOUND A BEVY OF GIRLS SITTING ON SOME BENCHES UNDER A SPREADING OAK WEAVING SPRING FLOWERS HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE PRINCESS SO COULD NOT POSITIVELY KNOW HER
I CAN TEACH YOU NOW IF YOU WISH SAID I SHE SAW SHE WAS CORNERED AND REPLIED WITH A TOSS OF HER SAUCY LITTLE HEAD BUT WHAT IF I DO NOT WISH NOW THIS WAS MORE THAN I COULD ENDURE WITH PATIENCE SO I ANSWERED MY YOUNG LADY
IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO DETERMINE SUCH MATTERS I AM SURE HOWEVER SHE IS NOT HERE FOR I DOUBT NOT SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GENTLE ANSWER TO A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN I SHALL CONTINUE MY SEARCH WITH THIS
HE SAID IT IS LOOSE I SAY INSISTED THE PRINCESS WITH A LITTLE IRRITATION THE SADDLE FEELS LIKE IT TRY THE OTHER
COMING UP TO THE GROUP BRANDON TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WITH A GRACEFUL LITTLE BOW THAT LET THE CURLS FALL AROUND HIS FACE ASKED HAVE I THE HONOR TO FIND THE PRINCESS MARY AMONG THESE LADIES MARY
IT NEEDED BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE HIM TO MAKE HER KNOW HER MALADY AND MEET IT FACE TO FACE UPON THE EVENING WHEN MARY LEARNED ALL THIS SHE WENT INTO HER CHAMBER VERY EARLY AND CLOSED THE DOOR
AND WHEN SHE LOVED OR MARRIED IT SHOULD BE FOR HENRY'S BENEFIT REGARDLESS OF ALL ELSE BRANDON AND THE LADY MARY SAW A GREAT DEAL OF EACH OTHER DURING THIS LITTLE STAY AT WINDSOR AS SHE ALWAYS HAD SOME PLAN TO BRING ABOUT A MEETING
AND FOOLISH AS MY FEELING MAY HAVE BEEN I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER DOING IT I RESOLVED THAT IF SHE PERMITTED ANOTHER MAN TO TEACH HER THAT DANCE IT SHOULD BE ALL OVER BETWEEN US
THAT IS WITH YOU EDWIN EDWIN OH SO SOFT AND SWEET THE LITTLE JADE TO THINK THAT SHE COULD HOODWINK ME SO EASILY AND TALK ME INTO A GOOD HUMOR WITH HER SOFT PURRING EDWIN I SAW THROUGH IT ALL QUICKLY ENOUGH
WITH THEIR CHESTS FOLLOWING IN THE HANDS OF FOUR PORTERS A BOAT SOON TOOK THEM ABOARD THE ROYAL HIND AND NOW IT LOOKED AS IF THEIR DARING SCHEME SO FULL OF IMPROBABILITY AS TO SEEM IMPOSSIBLE HAD REALLY COME TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE FROM THE BEGINNING I THINK IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO MARY TO DOUBT THE RESULT
AND MUCH MORE HAS EVERYTHING A NATURAL INCLINATION TOWARDS WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTELY UNIVERSAL GOOD
ARE INDIVIDUAL FORMS WHICH THE INTELLECT CANNOT APPREHEND AS SUCH HENCE IT MUST BE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE IS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
IT IS NOT SAID TO BE ASSUMED OTHERWISE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL BODIES MOVED BY THE ANGELS ARE ASSUMED BY THEM THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES
THIS CAN EASILY BE EXPLAINED IF WE CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES OF SPECIES AND FORMS FOR WE OBSERVE THAT THE SPECIES AND FORMS OF THINGS DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER AS THE PERFECT AND IMPERFECT
SINCE OUR INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IT SEEMS THAT WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS ACTIVE BUT ONLY THAT IT IS PASSIVE
EXCEPT ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIONS OF THE SENSES THAT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENSING THEM THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR A SPECIAL GENUS OF APPETITIVE POWERS SINCE THE NATURAL APPETITE OF THE POWERS WOULD SUFFICE
AND SCRIPTURE IMPLIES THE SAME WHEN IT SAYS THAT MAN WAS MADE TO GOD'S LIKENESS FOR THE PREPOSITION TO SIGNIFIES A CERTAIN APPROACH AS OF SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE
SENSATION IS ENTIRELY A VITAL FUNCTION CONSEQUENTLY IT CAN IN NO WAY BE SAID THAT THE ANGELS PERCEIVE THROUGH THE ORGANS OF THEIR ASSUMED BODIES YET SUCH BODIES ARE NOT FASHIONED IN VAIN
ALTHOUGH SENSE AND APPETITE ARE PRINCIPLES OF MOVEMENT IN PERFECT ANIMALS YET SENSE AND APPETITE AS SUCH ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE MOVEMENT UNLESS ANOTHER POWER BE ADDED TO THEM
ACCORDING AS ONE DAY IS HOTTER THAN ANOTHER ONE SEASON THAN ANOTHER AND ONE YEAR THAN ANOTHER ARE DUE TO CERTAIN PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS WHICH MOVEMENTS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR BEGINNING ON THE FOURTH DAY
WHEREFORE SINCE NATURE IS FIRST IN EVERYTHING WHAT BELONGS TO NATURE MUST BE A PRINCIPLE IN EVERYTHING THIS IS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN MAN WITH RESPECT TO BOTH HIS INTELLECT AND HIS WILL FOR THE INTELLECT KNOWS PRINCIPLES NATURALLY
BUT WHERE ONE IS THE WHOLE CAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE AND GOODNESS OF THE OTHER THAT ONE IS NATURALLY MORE LOVED THAN SELF BECAUSE AS WE SAID ABOVE EACH PART NATURALLY LOVES THE WHOLE MORE THAN ITSELF AND EACH INDIVIDUAL NATURALLY LOVES THE GOOD OF THE SPECIES
THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS APPREHENDED THROUGH THAT SENSE IS WANTING ALSO FOR INSTANCE A MAN WHO IS BORN BLIND CAN HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF COLORS
THE NATURAL APPETITE IS THAT INCLINATION WHICH EACH THING HAS OF ITS OWN NATURE FOR SOMETHING WHEREFORE BY ITS NATURAL APPETITE EACH POWER DESIRES SOMETHING SUITABLE TO ITSELF BUT THE ANIMAL APPETITE
ALL THAT IS MADE MANIFEST IS LIGHT
WHICH RECEIVE LIFE FROM THE POWER OF THE SUN AND STARS MUCH MORE THEREFORE HAVE THE HEAVENLY BODIES A LIVING SOUL
THE APPETITIVE AND INTELLECTUAL POWERS ARE DIFFERENT GENERA OF POWERS IN THE SOUL BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENT FORMALITIES OF THEIR OBJECTS BUT THE APPETITIVE POWER AGREES PARTLY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL POWER
A PARTICULAR POWER REPLY
FURTHER A SIMPLE FORM CANNOT BE A SUBJECT BUT THE SOUL IS A SIMPLE FORM SINCE IT IS NOT COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM AS WE HAVE SAID ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY FIVE
WHEREBY THE SUPERIOR MAKES USE OF HIS SUBJECTS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT AND GOOD AND THIS KIND OF SUBJECTION EXISTED EVEN BEFORE SIN FOR GOOD ORDER WOULD HAVE BEEN WANTING IN THE HUMAN FAMILY IF SOME WERE NOT GOVERNED BY OTHERS WISER THAN THEMSELVES
THAT THE ACCIDENTAL FORM IS A PRINCIPLE OF ACTION IS DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM
BUT UNITING AND BINDING IMPLY VARIOUS THINGS BROUGHT TOGETHER THEREFORE THE ANGEL CANNOT LOVE HIMSELF
WHICH POTENTIALITY HOWEVER DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE SOUL THEREFORE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL IS NOT ITS POWER FOR NOTHING IS IN POTENTIALITY BY REASON OF AN ACT AS ACT
AND THE INTELLECT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH
OF ALL THE OTHER POWERS ON THE CONTRARY
NAMELY AS ONE IS SIMPLER THAN ANOTHER AND OF KEENER INTELLECT THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT DIFFER SPECIFICALLY
OTHERWISE THE OBJECTS OF SCIENCES WOULD NOT BE THINGS BUT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES NOW IT HAPPENS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT FORMS ARE LIKENED TO THE SAME THING
IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF MATTER FOR THE OPERATION BELONGING TO ANYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF ITS SUBSTANCE NOW TO UNDERSTAND IS AN ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL
SAYS THAT CORPOREAL THINGS ARE GOVERNED BY GOD THROUGH THE ANGELS BUT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS FORMED FROM CORPOREAL MATTER THEREFORE IT WAS MADE THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE ANGELS AND NOT IMMEDIATELY BY GOD
THEREFORE THE POWERS ARE OF NECESSITY DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR ACTS AND OBJECTS NEVERTHELESS WE MUST OBSERVE THAT THINGS WHICH ARE ACCIDENTAL DO NOT CHANGE THE SPECIES
SINCE THE OBJECT OF THE INTELLECT IS THE VERY IDEA OF APPETIBLE GOOD AND THE APPETIBLE GOOD THE IDEA OF WHICH IS IN THE INTELLECT IS THE OBJECT OF THE WILL NOW THE MORE SIMPLE AND THE MORE ABSTRACT A THING IS THE NOBLER AND HIGHER IT IS IN ITSELF
WHETHER THERE IS ONE POWER OF THE SOUL OR SEVERAL THREE HOW THE POWERS OF THE SOUL ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER FOUR OF THE ORDERS OF THE POWERS ONE TO ANOTHER
MUCH MORE IS THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL CREATED BY GOD UNDER INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES AND SO THE SOUL UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL THINGS THROUGH INNATE SPECIES
THAT THESE BODIES HAVE LIFE IS NOT A DIFFERENCE OF THINGS BUT OF WORDS
WHICH IS ONE WITH IT IN SPECIES WITH A NATURAL AFFECTION IN SO FAR AS IT LOVES ITS OWN SPECIES THIS IS MANIFEST EVEN IN THINGS DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE FOR FIRE HAS A NATURAL INCLINATION TO COMMUNICATE ITS FORM TO ANOTHER THING
WHICH HAVING ATTAINED IT RESTS THIS DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE MOVEMENT OF HEAVENLY BODIES HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY ARE MOVED BY SOME INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES AUGUSTINE APPEARS TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION WHEN HE EXPRESSES HIS BELIEF
IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THEM
IS LOVED BY EVERYTHING WITH NATURAL LOVE
THEREFORE ONE ANGEL DOES NOT LOVE ANOTHER AS HIMSELF BUT LOVES HIMSELF MORE
OF MORE PERFECT CREATURES
CONSEQUENTLY SINCE GOD IS THE UNIVERSAL GOOD AND UNDER THIS GOOD BOTH MAN AND ANGEL AND ALL CREATURES ARE COMPRISED
OF THIS WE HAVE A SIGN IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THE MEMBERS ARE DEPRIVED OF THEIR NATURAL DISPOSITION
SECONDLY BECAUSE IF IT WERE NECESSARY FOR THE THING KNOWN TO EXIST MATERIALLY IN THE KNOWER THERE WOULD BE NO REASON WHY THINGS WHICH HAVE A MATERIAL EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE SOUL SHOULD BE DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE WHY FOR INSTANCE IF BY FIRE THE SOUL KNOWS FIRE
YET IT IS THE STONE WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD NOT THE LIKENESS OF THE STONE
REMAINS SEPARATE FROM THE BODY AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM ON THE CONTRARY ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER
THE SOUL COMMUNICATES THAT EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT SUBSISTS TO THE CORPOREAL MATTER OUT OF WHICH AND THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE RESULTS UNITY OF EXISTENCE SO THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE COMPOSITE IS ALSO THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL
BUT MORE THAN THESE GREEN SOWN FIELDS IN THE SAME WAY EVERY OTHER POWER DESIRES ITS APPROPRIATE OBJECT THEREFORE THE APPETITIVE POWER SHOULD NOT BE MADE A SPECIAL GENUS OF THE POWERS OF THE SOUL
SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN WHEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE THIS WAS MOST NECESSARY AS REGARDS THE HUMAN RACE IN WHICH THE MALE AND FEMALE LIVE TOGETHER FOR LIFE
FOR PLATO SUPPOSED THAT THE FORMS OF NATURAL THINGS SUBSISTED APART FROM MATTER AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THEY ARE INTELLIGIBLE SINCE A THING IS ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE FROM THE VERY FACT THAT IT IS IMMATERIAL
CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
IT HAS BEEN THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD HOWEVER SECONDARY CAUSES MAY HAVE OPERATED BUT THE ELASTICITY OF HER SPIRITS SOON RECOVERED THEIR TONE IT WAS IN THE LATTER HALF OF THAT YEAR
EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
DO YOU KNOW THAT OUR BROWNING IS GONE YOU MUST PREPARE FOR A WILLIAM WHEN YOU COME A GOOD LOOKING LAD CIVIL AND QUIET AND SEEMING LIKELY TO DO
WILL BE ASTONISHED AT MY WRITING SO MUCH
BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
AND HOW OFTEN YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF HANGING YOURSELF RESTRAINED ONLY AS SOME ILL NATURED ASPERSION UPON POOR OLD WINTON HAS IT BY THE WANT OF A TREE WITHIN SOME MILES OF THE CITY CHARLES KNIGHT AND HIS COMPANIONS PASSED THROUGH CHAWTON
LAID AT ADMIRAL CROFT'S LODGINGS BUT HER PERFORMANCE DID NOT SATISFY HER SHE THOUGHT IT TAME AND FLAT AND WAS DESIROUS OF PRODUCING SOMETHING BETTER THIS WEIGHED UPON HER MIND THE MORE SO PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE WEAK STATE OF HER HEALTH
WHICH WAS FREQUENTLY OCCUPIED BY HER MOTHER WHO WAS MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS OLD JANE WOULD NEVER USE IT EVEN IN HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE BUT SHE CONTRIVED A SORT OF COUCH FOR HERSELF WITH TWO OR THREE CHAIRS
IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
I WISH IT MAY PROVE SO NOW AND THAT WHEN MISTER W DIGWEED REACHES STEVENTON TO MORROW
WE MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LIVED LONGER BUT SHE WAS ENABLED WITHOUT DISMAY OR COMPLAINT TO PREPARE FOR DEATH SHE WAS A HUMBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN HER LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HOME DUTIES
STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
SEVENTEENTH IS THE LAST DATE TO BE FOUND IN THE MANUSCRIPT ON WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED AND AS THE WATCH OF THE DROWNED MAN INDICATES THE TIME OF HIS DEATH SO DOES THIS FINAL DATE SEEM TO FIX THE PERIOD WHEN HER MIND COULD NO LONGER PURSUE ITS ACCUSTOMED COURSE AND HERE
BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
A LARGE SLAB OF BLACK MARBLE IN THE PAVEMENT MARKS THE PLACE HER OWN FAMILY ONLY ATTENDED THE FUNERAL HER SISTER RETURNED TO HER DESOLATED HOME THERE TO DEVOTE HERSELF FOR TEN YEARS TO THE CARE OF HER AGED MOTHER AND TO LIVE MUCH
THOUGH I AM OTHERWISE VERY WELL AND THIS IS NOT A SEASON FOR DONKEY CARRIAGES AND AS WE DO NOT LIKE TO SPARE UNCLE CHARLES HE HAS DECLINED IT TOO TUESDAY AH AH MISTER E
AND RECALLED OLD RECOLLECTIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM IN A PARTICULAR MANNER AS IF SHE DID NOT EXPECT EVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN
AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
THE SENSE OF POWER REVIVED AND IMAGINATION RESUMED ITS COURSE SHE CANCELLED THE CONDEMNED CHAPTER AND WROTE TWO OTHERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN ITS STEAD
THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
WHEN SHE IS REALLY RECOVERED SHE OUGHT TO TRY CHANGE OF AIR AND COME OVER TO US TELL YOUR FATHER THAT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS SHARE OF YOUR LETTER AND MOST SINCERELY JOIN IN THE HOPE OF HER BEING EVENTUALLY MUCH THE BETTER
THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
YOU WILL HEAR FROM UNCLE HENRY HOW WELL ANNA IS SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY RECOVERED BEN WAS HERE ON SATURDAY TO ASK UNCLE CHARLES AND ME TO DINE WITH THEM AS TO MORROW BUT I WAS FORCED TO DECLINE IT THE WALK IS BEYOND MY STRENGTH
I WILL NOT BOAST OF MY HANDWRITING NEITHER THAT NOR MY FACE HAVE YET RECOVERED THEIR PROPER BEAUTY BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS I GAIN STRENGTH VERY FAST I AM NOW OUT OF BED FROM NINE IN THE MORNING TO TEN AT NIGHT
AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
HER REPLY WAS NOTHING BUT DEATH THESE WERE HER LAST WORDS IN QUIETNESS AND PEACE
POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
SOME OF THESE THOUGHTS WERE IN THE MINDS OF THE BROTHER AND SISTER NOW FIVE YEARS DOES SEEM A LONG WHILE FRANCIS WAS SAYING
DON'T LOOK SO CUT UP ABOUT IT FRANK OLD MAN
A FAREWELL DINNER MAURICE OAKLEY WAS NOT A MAN OF SUDDEN OR VIOLENT ENTHUSIASMS CONSERVATISM WAS THE QUALITY THAT HAD BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF HIS FORTUNES
MISTER SKAGGS HAD NO QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD COME BY THE DAMAGING EVIDENCE AGAINST MAURICE OAKLEY IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM THAT HE HAD IT
AT THE VERY THOUGHT HIS HAND TREMBLED AND THE MAN IN THE CHAIR ASKED HIM IF HE HAD N'T BEEN DRINKING WHEN HE MET MINTY IN THE EVENING HOWEVER THE FIRST GLANCE AT HER REASSURED HIM HER FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES AS SHE CAME FORWARD AND HELD OUT HER HAND
AND SHE WAS FORCED TO THROW OPEN THE DOORS SO LONG CLOSED AND CALL IN HELP THE NEIGHBOURS AND HER OLD FRIENDS WENT TO HER ASSISTANCE AND WHAT THE REPORTER'S STORY HAD NOT DONE
THIS HE GULPED DOWN AND FOLLOWED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR A WHILE HE STOOD STILL BROODING SILENTLY HIS RED EYES BLINKING AT THE LIGHT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND LEFT THE CLUB
HIS VOICE WAS STEADIER NOW BUT GRIM WHAT DO YOU WANT
HE HAD LIVED LIKE AN OX WORKING WITHOUT INSPIRATION OR REWARD AND HE CAME FORTH LIKE AN OX FROM HIS STALL
BECOME OF EM HOW S KIT AN JOE
AND HALF HIDDEN BY A FULL MUSTACHE THAT MADE MUCH FORGIVABLE TO BEAUTY LOVING EYES IT WAS GENERALLY CONCEDED
SKAGGS DID NOT TELL HIM THAT NOW THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD DONE ITS WORK IT DEMANDED THE RIGHT TO CROW TO ITS HEART'S SATISFACTION HE SAID ONLY
HE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT HE KNEW HOW HIS MOTHER IF NOT KIT WOULD RECEIVE HER AND YET HE DARED NOT ANGER THIS WOMAN WHO HAD HIS FATE IN THE HOLLOW OF HER HAND SHE SAW HIS HESITATION AND SPOKE UP
NO NO KITTY BROKE IN
HE WAS SINKING INTO THE DULL DEAD ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE HER OWN LETTERS TO HIM FELL OFF IT WAS HARD GETTING THE CHILDREN TO WRITE
MISTER THOMAS WAS THE ONLY COOL ONE IN THE PARTY HE WAS QUIETLY TAKING STOCK OF HIS YOUNG COMPANION OF HER INNOCENCE AND CHARM SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL LITTLE AND DAINTY BUT WELL DEVELOPED FOR HER AGE HER HAIR WAS VERY BLACK AND WAVY
DOWN HOME HE HAD SHAVED THE WILD YOUNG BUCKS OF THE TOWN AND WHILE DOING IT DRUNK IN EAGERLY THEIR UNGUARDED NARRATIONS OF THEIR GAY EXPLOITS
TO TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT IT HAD DONE AND HOW IT HAD DONE IT THEY GAVE HIM HIS WIFE'S ADDRESS IT WOULD BE BETTER THEY THOUGHT FOR HER TO TELL HIM HERSELF
WHO HAD BEEN HIS WIFE BERRY TOOK THE ADDRESS AND INQUIRED HIS WAY TIMIDLY HESITATINGLY BUT WITH A SWELLING HEART TO THE DOOR OF THE FLAT
YOU LL SEE WHAT LL HAPPEN HE CRIED YOU LL SEE FANNIE LOOKED AT HER SON AND SHE SEEMED TO SEE HIM MORE CLEARLY THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE HIS FOPPERY HIS MEANNESS HIS COWARDICE WELL SHE ANSWERED WITH A SIGH
BUT HE HAD RECKONED WITHOUT HIS HOST MISSUS HAMILTON MIGHT MAKE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS TO STRANGERS ON THE SCORE OF EXPEDIENCY BUT SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO YIELD ONE IOTA OF HER DIGNITY TO ONE WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN SO LONG AS AN INFERIOR
JOE LOOKED AT THEM HUNGRILY BUT THE MAN IN FRONT WITH HIS SISTER DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE BROTHER OR THE REST OF THE PARTY IN HIS MISCELLANEOUS INTRODUCTIONS ONE BRIEF BIT OF CONVERSATION WHICH THE MOTHER OVERHEARD ESPECIALLY TROUBLED HER
HE HAD DONE THIS HIS HOUSE HIS REPUTATION HIS SATISFACTION WERE ALL EVIDENCES THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED A CHILDLESS MAN
AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE STRANGE CORDIALITY OF THE YOUNG WHITE MAN WHO MET HIM AT THE WARDEN'S OFFICE FIVE YEARS OF PRISON LIFE HAD MADE A DIFFERENT MAN OF HIM
KITTY DID NOT LIKE THE ARRANGEMENT AND INNOCENTLY SUGGESTED THAT HER BROTHER TAKE HER SEAT WHILE SHE WENT BACK TO HER MOTHER
THE MEN LINGERED OVER THEIR CIGARS THE WINE WAS OLD AND THE STORIES NEW WHAT MORE COULD THEY ASK THERE WAS A STRONG GLOW IN FRANCIS OAKLEY'S FACE
PUT BEHIND HIM THE BERRY HAMILTON THAT LAUGHED AND JOKED AND SANG AND BELIEVED FOR EVEN HIS FAITH
CLEAR INTERESTING AND STRONG ONE COULD SEE IT ALL AS IF EVERY PHASE OF IT WERE BEING ENACTED BEFORE ONE'S EYES SKAGGS SURPASSED HIMSELF
BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THEM HE HAD HIS STORY IT WAS VIVID INTERESTING DRAMATIC IT MEANT THE FAVOUR OF HIS EDITOR
TO SAVE ITS TOTTERING REPUTATION IT WOULD NOT SURRENDER BUT IT CAPITULATED AND BERRY HAMILTON WAS PARDONED
WHERE SHE REMAINED IN SPITE OF ALL THOMAS'S PALPABLE EFFORTS TO GET HER AWAY FINALLY HE PROPOSED THAT THEY ALL GO TO SUPPER AT ONE OF THE COLOURED CAFES
THEY HAD GOOD SEATS IN THE FIRST BALCONY AND HERE THEIR GUIDE HAD SHOWN HIS MANAGERIAL ABILITY AGAIN FOR HE HAD FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE OR SAID SO TO GET ALL THE SEATS TOGETHER SO THAT HE AND THE GIRL WERE IN THE ROW IN FRONT AND TO ONE SIDE OF WHERE THE REST SAT
WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE HIM IF SHE WERE NEAR AND YET HE WAS GOING AWAY FROM HER GIVING UP THE PEARL THAT HE HAD ONLY TO PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE
FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
HE PAUSED IN THE HALL AND DESPATCHED A SERVANT TO BRING HIS BROTHER TO HIM MAURICE FOUND HIM STANDING WEAKLY AGAINST THE RAILING OF THE STAIRS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR IMPRESSED HIS BROTHER STRANGELY
AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
IF THERE COULD BE SUCH A STRANGER WOULD HAVE SAID DOWN HOME THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER WHICH SHE RECOGNISED THOMAS WAS NOT THE PROVINCIAL WHO PUTS EVERY ONE ON A PAR WITH HIMSELF NOR WAS HE THE METROPOLITAN WHO COMPLACENTLY PATRONISES THE WHOLE WORLD
THAT INSTANTLY PRICKED THE ATTENTION AWAKE HE READ ON WITH INCREASING INTEREST THIS IS GOOD STUFF HE SAID AT THE LAST PAGE
WITH A RARE GENIUS FOR ADAPTING HIMSELF TO NEW CONDITIONS HE ACCEPTED THE CHANGED ORDER OF THINGS WITH A PASSIVE RESIGNATION BUT WITH A STERN DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF ANY GOOD
I WONDER WHO THAT LITTLE LIGHT GIRL IS THAT THOMAS IS WITH TO NIGHT HE S A HOT ONE FOR YOU MISSUS HAMILTON HAD BEEN IN A THEATRE BUT ONCE BEFORE IN HER LIFE AND JOE AND KIT BUT A FEW TIMES OFTENER
SAID SADNESS REALLY IT S A WASTE OF TIME FOR JOE TO SOBER UP HULLO THERE AS THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT UP AGAINST HIM TAKE A SEAT HE PUT HIM IN A CHAIR AT THE TABLE
FIND JUST THE ATMOSPHERE THAT SUITED HIS DELICATE ARTISTIC NATURE AFTER A VISIT OF TWO MONTHS HE WAS ABOUT RETURNING TO PARIS FOR A STAY OF FIVE YEARS
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MAN OR A MONSTER
BACK TO THE WALL STILL HIS HANDS TWITCHED
HE KNEW THAT SHE WAS MUCH OLDER THAN HE BUT HE ONLY TOOK THIS FACT AS AN ADDITIONAL SIGN OF HIS PROWESS IN HAVING WON HER
TO SUPPER HE THOUGHT WAS SHE MOCKING HIM WAS SHE RESTRAINING HER SCORN OF HIM ONLY TO MAKE HIS HUMILIATION THE GREATER AFTER A WHILE
I WAS VERY MUCH THRILLED I WELL RECOLLECT THE TIME I WELL REMEMBER AN OCCASION I WILL ACCEPT THE GENERAL PROPOSITION
I HAVE TRIED TO CONVEY TO YOU I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO SPEAK I HAVE VERY MUCH LESS FEELING OF I HAVE WATCHED WITH SOME ATTENTION
F FACILE SHOWY CHEAP AND SUPERFICIAL FAITHFUL TRUTHFUL LOYAL AND TRUSTWORTHY FAME DISTINCTION DIGNITY AND HONOR
I WILL NOW CONSIDER WITH YOU I WILL NOW LEAVE THIS QUESTION I WILL NOW TAKE AN INSTANCE I WILL ONLY SPEAK TO ONE POINT
R RADIANTLY AND TRANSPARENTLY HAPPY RAILED AT THE WORLD RARE CANDOR AND FLEXIBILITY OF MIND
FICTION FANCY FALSEHOOD AND FABRICATION FINE FRAGILE DELICATE AND DAINTY FIRMNESS STEADFASTNESS STABILITY AND TENACITY
YOU KNOW THE LEGEND WHICH HAS GROWN UP YOU KNOW VERY WELL YOU MAY ALSO BE ASSURED YOU MAY BE ACQUAINTED WITH YOU MAY BE SURE
I REGRET THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME I REGRET THE TIME LIMITS ME I REGRET THIS THE LESS I REJOICE IN AN OCCASION LIKE THIS I REJOICE THAT EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED
WHICH SUDDENLY OVERWHELMS YOUR MIND LIKE AN UNEXPECTED AND EXQUISITE THOUGHT AN ENVIOUS WIND CREPT BY LIKE AN UNWELCOME THOUGHT AN IDEAL AS SUBLIME AND COMPREHENSIVE AS THE HORIZON
THE AMBITION AND RIVALSHIP OF MEN THE ANGRY BLOOD BURNED IN HIS FACE THE ANGUISH OF A SPIRITUAL CONFLICT TORE HIS HEART
HER SOLICITUDE THRILLED HIM HER STARE DISSOLVED HER STEP SEEMED TO PITY THE GRASS IT PREST HER STRENGTH WAS SCATTERED IN FITS OF AGITATION HER STUMBLING IGNORANCE WHICH SOUGHT THE ROAD OF WISDOM
PRAY DON'T APOLOGIZE PRAY FORGIVE ME FOR INTRUDING ON YOU SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY PRAY GO ON PRECISELY THAT IS JUST WHAT I MEANT
SENSUOUS ENJOYMENT OF THE OUTWARD SHOW OF LIFE SERENITY BEAMED FROM HIS LOOK SERENITY OF PARALYSIS AND DEATH SERIOUSNESS LURKED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES
THE EXAGGERATIONS OF MORBID HALLUCINATIONS THE EXCITEMENT
STRUCK DUMB WITH STRANGE SURPRISE STUNG BY HIS THOUGHTS AND IMPATIENT OF REST STUNG BY THE SPLENDOR OF THE PROSPECT SUBDUED PASSAGES OF UNOBTRUSIVE MAJESTY
YOU HAVE BEEN MINDFUL YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO CONFER UPON ME YOU HAVE BUT TO OBSERVE YOU HAVE DONE ME GREAT HONOR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
THE RESTLESSNESS OF OFFENDED VANITY THE RETREATING SPLENDOR OF AUTUMN THE RISING STORM OF WORDS THE RIVER RAN DARKLY MYSTERIOUSLY BY THE RIVER SANG WITH ITS LIPS TO THE PEBBLES
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MORE THAN ONE WE HAVE COME TOGETHER TO NIGHT WE HAVE GREAT REASON TO BE THANKFUL WE HAVE HEARD LATELY
MERCILESS REMORSELESS RELENTLESS AND RUTHLESS MILD GENTLE HUMBLE AND SUBMISSIVE MISMANAGEMENT INDECISION OBSTINACY AND HARDIHOOD
AN INTENSE TRAVAIL OF MIND AN OBSCURE THRILL OF ALARM AN ODD LITTLE AIR OF PENITENT SELF DEPRECIATION
LIKE A DISTANT STAR GLIMMERING STEADILY IN THE DARKNESS LIKE A DREAM SHE VANISHED LIKE A FESTOONED GIRDLE ENCIRCLING THE WAIST OF A BRIDE LIKE A FLOWER HER RED LIPS PARTED
THE MELODIES OF BIRDS AND BEES THE MEMORY OF THE NIGHT GREW FANTASTIC AND REMOTE THE METICULOUS OBSERVATION OF FACTS THE MIND FREEZES AT THE THOUGHT THE MIND WAS FILLED WITH A FORMLESS DREAD
OF THE MOMENT YIELDED TO THE PERSUASIVE WARMTH OF DAY THE MARVELOUS BEAUTY OF HER WOMANHOOD THE MAXIMUM OF ATTAINABLE AND COMMUNICABLE TRUTH THE MELANCHOLY
IT ALSO PLEASES ME VERY MUCH IT AMOUNTS TO THIS IT APPEARS FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT APPEARS TO ME ON THE CONTRARY
IN EXTENUATION OF THE PAST IN HIGH GOOD HUMOR
OPPRESSED BY SOME VAGUE DREAD ORGANS OF PARTY RAGE AND POPULAR FRENZY OUR OPINIONS WERE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
IT IS AN ODD JEALOUSY IT IS AN INTOLERABLE IDEA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST ACKNOWLEDGING THIS
WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED TO KNOW IS WHAT WE HAVE MOST TO COMPLAIN OF WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WHATEVER A MAN THINKS
STRETCHED OUT IN DREARY MONOTONY STRICT AND UNALLOYED VERACITY STRUCK INCESSANTLY AND REMORSELESSLY
HE SURRENDERED HIMSELF TO GLOOMY THOUGHT HE THREADED A LABYRINTH OF OBSCURE STREETS HE THREW A TON'S WEIGHT OF RESOLVE UPON HIS MUSCLES HE THREW OUT PHRASES OF ILL HUMOR HE THREW ROUND A MEASURING EYE
DIFFUSE DISCURSIVE RAMBLING AND WORDY
INSTANTLY ALIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST BREACH OF DECORUM INSUFFERABLE VIOLENCE TO THE FEELINGS INTENSE AND STUBBORN DOGMATISM
THOUGHTS CAME THRONGING IN PANIC HASTE THRILLED BY FRESH AND INDESCRIBABLE ODORS THRILLED WITH A SENSE OF STRANGE ADVENTURE THROUGH A CYCLE OF MANY AGES
AN AUTHORITATIVE AND CONCLUSIVE INQUIRY
INTENSE SENSITIVENESS
THE DEEP FLUSH EBBED OUT OF HIS FACE THE DEEP TRANQUILLITY OF THE SHADED SOLITUDE THE DEEPENING TWILIGHT FILLED WITH SHADOWY VISIONS THE DEEPEST WANTS
STRIKING SIMILES A A BLIND RAGE LIKE A FIRE SWEPT OVER HIM A BOOK THAT RENDS AND TEARS LIKE A BROKEN SAW A BREATH OF MELANCHOLY MADE ITSELF FELT
THE ACCELERATED BEAT OF HIS THOUGHTS THE AFFLUENT SPLENDOR OF THE SUMMER DAY THE AFTERNOON WAS FILLED WITH SOUND AND SUNSHINE THE AFTERNOON WAS WANING
HE RAISED A SILENCING HAND HE RULED AUTOCRATICALLY
IT EXHIBITS A STATE OF MIND IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE IT FOLLOWS INEVITABLY IT GIVES US AN EXALTED CONCEPTION
ENFORCED BY COERCIVE MEASURES ENORMITIES OF CRIME AND ANOMALIES OF LAW ENTANGLED IN THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSY
APPREHENSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT THE FUTURE ARDENT WORDS OF ADMIRATION ARMED ALL OVER WITH SUBTLE ANTAGONISMS ARTLESS AND UNQUESTIONING DEVOTION
MAY I VENTURE TO SUGGEST MAY IT NOT ALSO BE ADVANCED MAY THE DAY COME QUICKLY MEANTIME IT IS ENCOURAGING TO THINK MEANWHILE LET US FREELY RECOGNIZE
LIKE A GREAT TUNE TO WHICH THE PLANETS ROLL LIKE A HIGH AND RADIANT OCEAN LIKE A HIGH BORN MAIDEN LIKE A JEWEL EVERY COTTAGE CASEMENT SHOWED
AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD TO ANY MAN HE SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN EVER DISJOINED FROM HIS PARTY HITHERTO SINCE HE HAD BEEN SEATED BY THE JUDGE'S ORDER THE FORMER COMPANIONS OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY LIFE THE OLD MEN WHOM HE HAD USED TO KNOW
READ TO HIM TALK TO HIM GIVE HIM HIS FOOD AND DO ALL THAT IN ME LIES TO MAKE HIS LIFE BEARABLE LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY THAT VERY DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTERTAINED AT THE GREAT FAMILY CASTLE
THE PERSON WHOM HE NOW SAW MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN IN THE STREET OR MISTER FINN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN OR ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN LORD FAWN WAS VERY DIGNIFIED VERY RESERVED AND VERY UNHAPPY TO HIS THINKING HE WAS THE GREAT MARTYR OF THIS TRIAL
IT WAS OF COURSE KNOWN TO EVERYBODY THAT MADAME GOESLER HAD UNDERTAKEN A JOURNEY TO BOHEMIA AND AS MANY SUPPOSED A ROVING TOUR THROUGH ALL THE WILDER PARTS OF UNKNOWN EUROPE POLAND HUNGARY AND THE PRINCIPALITIES FOR INSTANCE
IN THESE FINE EARLY AUTUMN DAYS SPENT AT MATCHING THE GREAT TRUMPETON WOOD QUESTION WAS AT LAST SETTLED DURING THE SUMMER CONSIDERABLE ACERBITY HAD BEEN ADDED TO THE MATTER BY CERTAIN ARTICLES WHICH HAD APPEARED IN CERTAIN SPORTING PAPERS
I DO NOT WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS A WIDOW OH YES MISTER KENNEDY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE I LEFT ENGLAND
AND PHINEAS HAD FELT THAT IN ANY EMERGENCY HE COULD TELL HIS FRIEND ALL HIS HOPES AND FEARS BUT NOW HE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF HIS POSITION NOR DID LORD CANTRIP ALLUDE TO IT THEY WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW IN ORDER THAT LORD CANTRIP MIGHT READ THE CORRESPONDENCE
HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TELEGRAM DIRECT TO THE OLD BAILEY AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE NOW HELD IT IN HIS HAND
EXACTLY I AM SURE THAT THERE WILL HAVE BEEN NOTHING IN THEM PREJUDICIAL TO YOU WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IF YOU THINK IT NECESSARY WITH A VIEW TO YOUR OWN CHARACTER TO SHOW THEM TO ME OR TO ANOTHER FRIEND YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN THAT HE SHOULD DO THE SAME
AS IT WAS HE DID SUCCEED IN ALLUDING TO HIS OWN CONDITION IN A MANNER THAT BROUGHT UPON HIM NO REPROACH HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTY OF THE DEBATE WHICH WAS ONE SIMPLY OF LENGTH
THE QUARREL BETWEEN PHINEAS FINN AND MISTER BONTEEN HAD NOW BECOME THE TALK OF THE TOWN AND HAD TAKEN MANY VARIOUS PHASES THE POLITICAL PHASE THOUGH IT WAS PERHAPS THE BEST UNDERSTOOD WAS NOT THE MOST ENGROSSING
THAT HE SHOULD BE BEHELD BY COMMON EYES THEY NEVER EVEN EXPRESSED AN IDEA THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE COME ALLUDING EVEN TO THEIR PAST CONVICTIONS
I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY INDEED TO PUT THE DUKE TO ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENSE SAID LORD CHILTERN SOLEMNLY STILL FEARING THAT THE DUCHESS WAS ONLY PLAYING WITH HIM IT MADE HIM ANGRY THAT HE COULD NOT IMBUE OTHER PEOPLE WITH HIS IDEA OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMUSEMENT OF A WHOLE COUNTY
IT WAS NOW MADE AGAIN BY PHINEAS FINN WITH THE OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF DEFENDING HIMSELF AND HE FOR THE MOMENT BECAME THE TARGET FOR CONSERVATIVE WRATH
ONE IS INCLINED TO DO MORE FOR A DUKE OF OMNIUM THAN FOR A MISTER JONES THE DUKES HAVE MORE TO OFFER THAN THE JONESES I DON'T MEAN IN THE WAY OF WEALTH ONLY BUT OF WHAT ONE ENJOYS MOST IN SOCIETY GENERALLY
NOT BUT WHAT HE'S DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE'S BEEN AND DONE NOW MISTER SLIDE IN FORMER DAYS HAD BEEN THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FOR THE BOROUGH FROM ANY PART OF THE DISGRACE TO WHICH IT HAD SUBJECTED ITSELF BY ITS UNWORTHY CHOICE AND SOME TANKERVILLIANS OF SENSITIVE MINDS WERE OF OPINION THAT NO TANKERVILLIAN EVER AGAIN
HE WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS THAT ALL HIS MORNING HAD BEEN WASTED HE HAD ALLOWED HIS MIND TO RUN REVEL INSTEAD OF TYING IT DOWN TO THE FORMATION OF SENTENCES AND CONSTRUCTION OF ARGUMENTS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH THE SPEAKER AT FOUR O'CLOCK
ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER WE NOW PROPOSE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF WITH THE MEANS OF DOING SO AND HAD DONE SO AFTER A FASHION WHICH IS CONCLUSIVE AS TO HIS HAVING REQUIRED THE KEY FOR SOME GUILTY PURPOSE
LADY CHILTERN AND MADAME GOESLER WERE PRESENT AND ALSO PHINEAS FINN WELL HOW ABOUT THEM SAID THE LORD
SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT ADDRESS WAS FOUNDED ON THE PROPOSITION OF A FUTURE REFORM AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF WHICH HE HAD NOT FOR MANY YEARS ENTERTAINED A DOUBT
EXCEPT THAT HE HAD ONE INTERVIEW WITH MISTER LOW EVEN MISTER LOW FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE HIM COMPREHEND THE EXACT CONDITION OF THE AFFAIR AND COULD NOT INDUCE HIM TO BE COMFORTED WHEN HE DID UNDERSTAND IT WHAT HAD HE TO DO
BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
AND MISTER BOFFIN WAS THE HERO OF TEN MINUTES MISTER DAUBENY DETRACTED SOMETHING FROM THIS TRIUMPH BY THE OVERSTRAINED AND PERHAPS IRONIC PATHOS WITH WHICH HE DEPLORED THE LOSS OF HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND'S SERVICES
IT IS BETTER SO FOR OTHERWISE I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AND THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONE IN YOUR DISCOMFITURE AT THE BANK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD YOU SEE I CAN BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU MISTER FINN
LADY CANTRIP THOUGH HER HUSBAND WAS MISTER GRESHAM'S MOST INTIMATE FRIEND WAS ALTOGETHER OF THIS PARTY AS WAS ALSO THE DUCHESS OF SAINT BUNGAY WHO UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT BUT WHO HAD ONCE FANCIED HERSELF TO BE RUDELY TREATED BY MISSUS BONTEEN
I AM INFORMED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS THAT YOU WISH TO ADDRESS THE COURT BEFORE I BEGIN MY CHARGE
THAT NO CONSIDERATION SHOULD AT PRESENT TAKE HIM TO TANKERVILLE WE AIN'T GOING TO CHARGE YOU NOT ONE PENNY SAID MISTER GADMIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM I FEEL ALL THAT I OWE TO THE BOROUGH SAID PHINEAS AND TO THE WARM FRIENDS THERE WHO HAVE ESPOUSED MY CAUSE
WOULD THE COUNTESSES CARDS BE SHOWERED UPON HIM AGAIN ONE CARD OR RATHER NOTE HAD REACHED HIM WHILE HE WAS YET AT TANKERVILLE REMINDING HIM OF OLD DAYS IT WAS FROM MISSUS LOW THE WIFE OF THE BARRISTER
THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
HE TOLD HIS FRIEND THAT A CORRESPONDENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MISTER BONTEEN IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL USED AND AS TO WHICH HE WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO ASK HIS LORDSHIP'S ADVICE
BUT HE COULD HARDLY DO SO AND REMAIN A POPULAR MAGNATE IN ENGLAND IF HE CHOSE TO PUT HIMSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THE DESIRES AND VERY INSTINCTS OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HIS PROPERTY WAS SITUATED HE MUST LIVE AS A MAN FORBID THAT WAS THE GENERAL ARGUMENT
NEVERTHELESS THE JURY WERE ENTITLED TO HAVE BEFORE THEM THE FACTS NOW TENDERED IN EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE CALLED UPON TO GIVE A VERDICT AND THAT THEREFORE THEY SHOULD SUBMIT THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY TO THE VERY SERIOUS ADDITIONAL INCONVENIENCE WHICH THEY WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO ENDURE
IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
MISTER RUDDLES WAS AT ONCE DESPATCHED TO LONDON WITH TWO OTHER POLITICAL SPIRITS SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REAL DEPUTATION AND WAITED UPON PHINEAS TWO DAYS AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON
LET ME SEE WE ARE TO TURN HERE TO THE LEFT THAT GOES TO COPPERHOUSE CROSS NO DOUBT IS IT NOT ODD THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THIS HISTORY JUST BECAUSE THIS BRUTE WOULD NOT JUMP OVER THE FENCE I DARE SAY I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVEN IF HE HAD JUMPED OVER
AND HE ENJOYED IT LET A MAN DOUBT EVER SO MUCH HIS OWN CAPACITY FOR SOME PUBLIC EXHIBITION WHICH HE HAS UNDERTAKEN YET HE WILL ALWAYS PREFER TO FAIL IF FAIL HE MUST BEFORE A LARGE AUDIENCE
AND THE GENTLEMEN ASSEMBLED MEMBERS AND STRANGERS TOGETHER PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING BEFORE HE SAT DOWN PHINEAS MADE ONE ALLUSION TO THAT FORMER SCUTTLING OF THE SHIP
BETWEEN TWO LEADING POLITICIANS WILL FILL THE HOUSE AND ANY ALLUSION TO OUR EASTERN EMPIRE WILL CERTAINLY EMPTY IT AN APTITUDE FOR SUCH ENCOUNTERS IS ALMOST A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A POPULAR LEADER IN PARLIAMENT
PHINEAS COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM FEELING THAT MISSUS LOW INTENDED TO TRIUMPH OVER HIM BUT NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION THEY WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPLAINING THAT
IT SEEMED THAT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING AND MISTER WICKERBY THE ATTORNEY TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO THE PRISONER OVER THE BAR OF THE DOCK
PHINEAS FINN WAS BECOMING A HERO AGAINST THE TWELVE JURYMEN THE FINGER OF SCORN WOULD NEVER BE POINTED BUT HIS SUFFERINGS MUST ENDURE FOR HIS LIFE MIGHT PROBABLY EMBITTER HIS LIFE TO THE VERY END
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
SO BOBO WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND SAILED OUT UPON THE DARK SEA FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND CLEAR BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN FAR OFF HER COURSE INTO THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
AND THE PRINCE WILL DIE
FIRST ZIDOC LOCKED THE ONLY DOOR WITH A GREAT KEY AND THEN HE SAID TO SERPONEL BROTHER SOMEONE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS AN ENEMY HIDDEN UNDER THE SOFA
EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FAMOUS PAIR BEGAN THE JOURNEY TO THE ENCHANTER'S DEN THE DOG'S PLAN WAS TO PRETEND TO BE BUT AN EVERYDAY STRAY DOG AND TO THIS END HE ROLLED SEVERAL TIMES IN A MUD PUDDLE THE CAT TOO WAS TO APPEAR AS A STRAY CAT
IT WAS SHE WHO CAUSED THIS ENCHANTED CHAMBER TO APPEAR IN THE HEART OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF MY CASTLE AND IN THIS CHAMBER
SO THE KING GAVE THE CHARCOAL BURNER AND HIS WIFE FIFTY PIECES OF BRIGHT GOLD WHICH PLEASED THEM VERY MUCH AND THE CHARCOAL BURNER HIMSELF LIFTED THE BIRD BOY UP IN HIS ARMS AND PLACED HIM ON THE KING'S SADDLE
WAS FURIOUS AT BEING OPPOSED AND TOLD THE OLD ENCHANTER VERY ANGRILY THAT HE WAS NOT TO HAVE HIS CLASSES ANY MORE AND MUST LEAVE THE COLLEGE AT ONCE SO THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN PACKED UP HIS MAGIC BOOKS
IT WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND WORE TORTOISE SHELL GLASSES BUT BOBO HAD TO ANSWER NO AND THE OLD MAN WANDERED ON AGAIN ANOTHER DAY THE SIMPLETON ENCOUNTERED A TALL DARK FIERCE KIND OF FELLOW
SAID THE DWARF KING WITH HAVING TRIED TO ROB THE TREASURE CASTLE YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED ONE OF THE HORSE HEADED SERVITORS IN A FIRM STABLE TONE THEN SEND FOR THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE AT ONCE
AND THESE FILLED TO THE BRIM THEY CARRIED TO THE CASTLE DOOR SOON NOT THE TINIEST GEM WAS LEFT ON THE TABLE SUDDENLY
LISTEN THEN TO MY STORY AND HELP ME IF YOU CAN YOU SEE ME BEFORE YOU HIDEOUSLY CHANGED UNTIL YOU ENTERED HERE AN INSTANT PAST NO EYES BUT THOSE OF MY AUNT HAD BEHELD MY HORRIBLE COUNTENANCE
VERY WHISPERED BACK THE DOG IN HIS DEEPER TONE HAVING OPENED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THREE GREAT DOORS WITH THREE DIFFERENT IRON KEYS THE OLD WOMAN GUIDING HERSELF BY TOUCHING THE WALL WITH HER HAND
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE CAUSED THE LOCKED DOOR TO FLY OPEN NOW THOUGHT HE I WILL CAUSE THE CAT TO FOLLOW THE WRONG WHITE DOG AND THE DOG TO FOLLOW THE WRONG CAT
ON THE BOY'S BIRTHDAY A GREAT GRAY BIRD CAME FLYING OVER THE FOREST FROM THE DISTANT OCEAN CIRCLED THRICE THE CHARCOAL BURNERS HUT AND DISAPPEARED AGAIN CRYING MOURNFULLY ONE MIDSUMMER DAY
TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HIS WIFE WAS A SORCERESS AND GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN A LONELY TOWER AND THE CHILD DESTROYED
MARIANNA FOLLOWED HER TO THE HAMLET AND FOUND IN A WRETCHED HUT LYING ON A WRETCHED BED A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PEASANT GIRL DYING OF A FEVER SO MARIANNA TOUCHED THE GIRL WITH THE WATER OF HEALING AND IN AN INSTANT SHE BECAME WELL AND STRONG DEAR LADY SAID THE PEASANT GIRL
AND FLEW OFF INTO THE AIR FROM THE BARRED WINDOWS THE KING THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CHANCELLOR SAW LEAGUE UPON LEAGUE OF THE FOREST RUSHING BY BENEATH THEM SUDDENLY
WHEN THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF THE PATH THE PEASANT GIRL CRIED FAREWELL DEAR MARIANNA MAY IT SOME DAY BE MINE TO REPAY THEE INTO THE WORLD AGAIN WENT MARIANNA AND WITH HER WENT THE YELLOW BIRD PRESENTLY SHE CAME TO THE FAIREST LAND WHICH SHE HAD EVER SEEN
NOW WHILE THE HUNTER WAS FILLING HIS POCKETS THE FLASH OF A JEWEL LYING ON THE FLOOR HAPPENED TO CATCH HIS EYE AND LOOKING DOWN HE SAW THAT A KIND OF TRAIL OF JEWELS LAY ALONG THE FLOOR LEADING OUT OF THE ROOM
IT ROUSED THE PRINCE FROM HIS SWOON AND WITH HIS LAST MEASURE OF STRENGTH POOR DESIRE DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE WINDOW THE PROCESSION WAS THEN PASSING DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE WINDOW AND DESIRE'S EYES
AND DISCOVERED A DWARF CAUGHT IN A PIT WHICH HAD BEEN DUG TO TRAP WILD ANIMALS AFTER THE HUNTER HAD RESCUED THE DWARF FROM HIS PRISON THE LITTLE MAN SAID TO HIM GO TEN LEAGUES TO THE NORTH
GRASS GREW IN THE COURTYARD AND BETWEEN THE BRICKS OF THE TERRACE AND THE OAKEN DOOR WAS AS SOFT AND ROTTEN AS A LOG THAT HAS LONG BEEN BURIED IN MIRE ENTERING THE CASTLE THE HUNTER SOON DISCOVERED THE ROUND ROOM
HELP YOURSELF TO THE TREASURE AND RETURN HOME AT ONCE AND DO NOT NOW MARK ME WELL GO UP INTO THE TURRET OF THE CASTLE FOR IF YOU DO EVIL WILL COME OF IT
SUDDENLY A NARROW DOOR APPEARED IN THE WINDING WALL WHICH OPENED INWARD AS THEY DREW NEAR REVEALING A BEAUTIFUL ROUND CHAMBER RICHLY FURNISHED AND HUNG WITH THE FINEST TAPESTRIES BESIDE THE FIREPLACE IN WHICH A WOOD FIRE WAS CHEERILY BURNING
AND MOST POWERFUL OF THEM ALL AS FOR THE TREASURE OF THE TREASURE CASTLE IT IS STILL THERE PACKED IN THE LINEN SACKS LYING JUST INSIDE THE GREAT DOOR PERHAPS SOME DAY YOU MAY FIND IT
STOOD BY THE GATE TO SEE THE HORSEMAN RIDE AWAY PLUCKING UP COURAGE BOBO CAME FORWARD FELL ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE OLD MAN AND TOLD HIS STORY TRULY YOU SHOULD THANK THE STORM FAIRIES SAID THE OLD MAN
AND FINDING THE DAY AGREEABLE KEPT ON UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE WOODS ARRIVING AT THE CREST OF A LITTLE HILL IN THE WOODLAND
AT LAST HE HIT UPON A PLAN HE WOULD DECLARE THAT THE BIRD BOY WAS NOT A HUMAN LAD AT ALL BUT A WITCH CHILD HE WOULD THEN ACCUSE THE GOOD KING OF HAVING PROTECTED A WITCH CHILD
THE WONDERFUL TREASURES WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE IN THE WOOD MADE HIM A VERY RICH MAN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE NEWS OF HIS PROSPERITY CAME TO THE EARS OF THE KING THIS KING WAS THE WICKEDEST OF ROGUES
ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES SAT AN OLD WOMAN ALL ALONE AND WEEPING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY GOOD WOMAN SAID THE KING
THAT IT WAS NOT A CLOUD AT ALL BUT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREAT GRAY BIRDS FLAPPING THEIR LONG WINGS THE SHADOW OF THE BIRDS FELL OVER THE PLATFORM ON WHICH THE CRUEL MALEFICO SAT WAITING FOR THE KING AND THE BIRD BOY TO BE BROUGHT FORTH AND THEN CEASED MOVING
NOTHING SEEMED CHANGED THE WATER WITHIN SEEMED AS PURE AND DIAMOND LIKE AS EVER SHE TOUCHED THE PRINCE WITH THE LIQUID ALAS IN A MOMENT SO TERRIBLE WAS THE MAGICIAN'S POISON THAT THE PRINCE TURNED WHITE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW
HE TOLD OF THE TREASURE CASTLE IN THE WOOD ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE KING THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CHANCELLOR TAKING WITH THEM SOME STRONG LINEN BAGS AND SOME PACK MULES RODE FORTH IN QUEST OF THE TREASURE
LANGUAGES CATASTROPHES HISTORY SOCIAL DEPORTMENT AND AGRICULTURE
BOBO ASKED THE SAILORS IF THEY HAD SEEN A LOST HALF HOUR NO SAID THE SAILORS BUT WE ARE GOING TO THE ISLES OF IRON SUPPOSE YOU GO WITH US THE LOST HALF HOUR MAY BE THERE
AND EVEN IF IT WERE TO COME WHAT COULD IT DO TO SAVE US FROM THESE CRUEL PEOPLE WHEN THE CLOCK STOOD AT FIVE MINUTES TO TWELVE THERE WAS A CONFUSED NOISE BELOW
THE SUN STREAMING ON THE BLACK BROWN HAIR AND SILVER WHITE WINGS OF THE LITTLE BOY AND ON THE GOLDEN CURLS OF ROSABELLA TWELVE YEARS PASSED THE BIRD BOY GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD ROSABELLA INTO THE LOVELIEST OF PRINCESSES
THE CAT AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD ON ANYTHING THAT HAD CAT IN IT HE ONCE CATALOGUED ALL THE PRINCIPAL CATASTROPHES WHILE THE DOG ALTHOUGH A GOOD STUDENT HAD A FANCY FOR WRITING DOGGEREL
EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
IN SPITE OF HIS ROUGHNESS HOWEVER THE JAILER WAS NEITHER A BRUTAL NOR A WICKED MAN AND HE DID NOT RELISH THE CRUEL TASK WHICH THE KING HAD GIVEN HIM SO INSTEAD OF KILLING THE BIRD BOY
ALAS WHAT ARE WE TO DO I CAN NOT TAKE YOU WITH ME DEAR CHILD FOR IT IS FORBIDDEN ON PAIN OF DEATH TO BRING MORTALS TO THE ASSEMBLY NOR CAN I LEAVE YOU HERE IN THIS LONELY WOOD TO THIS MARIANNA REPLIED DO NOT FEAR DEAR FATHER GIVE ME BUT YON CRYSTAL FLASK OF THE WATER OF HEALING
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE CONDEMNS YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE TO BE MASTER BEATER OF THE PALACE CARPETS GREAT APPLAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SAGE JUDGMENT
AND LAST OF ALL A LITTLE GROUP IN WHICH WERE GARABIN THE MAGICIAN
NOW HE WOULD BE SENT TO FIND A WHITE CRAW'S FEATHER OR A SPRAY OF YELLOW BLUEBELLS NOW HE WAS ORDERED TO LOOK FOR A SQUARE WHEEL OR A GLASS OF DRY WATER EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM THAT IS
HER VERY FROWNS ARE FAIRER FAR THAN SMILES OF OTHER MAIDENS ARE H COLERIDGE
THE SAME MILTON THOU SHOULDST BE LIVING AT THIS HOUR ENGLAND HATH NEED OF THEE SHE IS A FEN OF STAGNANT WATERS
WHEN WE HOPE TO FIND AND THINK TO BURST OUT INTO SUDDEN BLAZE COMES THE BLIND FURY WITH THE ABHORRED SHEARS AND SLITS THE THIN SPUN LIFE BUT NOT THE PRAISE
AND ALL THE FOWL WHICH IN HIS FLOOD DID DWELL GAN FLOCK ABOUT THESE TWAIN THAT DID EXCEL THE REST SO FAR AS CYNTHIA DOTH SHEND THE LESSER STARS SO THEY ENRANGED WELL DID ON THOSE TWO ATTEND
ONE WORD IS TOO OFTEN PROFANED FOR ME TO PROFANE IT ONE FEELING TOO FALSELY DISDAIN'D FOR THEE TO DISDAIN IT ONE HOPE IS TOO LIKE DESPAIR FOR PRUDENCE TO SMOTHER
ABOVE BELOW THE ROSE OF SNOW TWINED WITH HER BLUSHING FOE WE SPREAD THE BRISTLED BOAR IN INFANT GORE WALLOWS BENEATH THE THORNY SHADE
THOUGH YOU BIND IN EVERY SHORE AND YOUR TRIUMPHS REACH AS FAR AS NIGHT AND DAY YET YOU PROUD MONARCHS MUST OBEY AND MINGLE WITH FORGOTTEN ASHES
A WET SHEET AND A FLOWING SEA A WIND THAT FOLLOWS FAST AND FILLS THE WHITE AND RUSTLING SAIL AND BENDS THE GALLANT MAST AND BENDS THE GALLANT MAST MY BOYS
AS THEY DRIFTED ON THEIR PATH THERE WAS SILENCE DEEP AS DEATH AND THE BOLDEST HELD HIS BREATH FOR A TIME BUT THE MIGHT OF ENGLAND FLUSH'D TO ANTICIPATE THE SCENE
WALK'D FORTH TO EASE MY PAIN ALONG THE SHORE OF SILVER STREAMING THAMES WHOSE RUTTY BANK THE WHICH HIS RIVER HEMS WAS PAINTED ALL WITH VARIABLE FLOWERS AND ALL THE MEADS ADORN'D WITH DAINTY GEMS FIT TO DECK MAIDENS BOWERS
AND THEIR BEST SERVICE LEND AGAINST THEIR WEDDING DAY WHICH WAS NOT LONG SWEET THAMES RUN SOFTLY TILL I END MY SONG
AND WE HEARD THE DISTANT AND RANDOM GUN THAT THE FOE WAS SULLENLY FIRING SLOWLY AND SADLY WE LAID HIM DOWN FROM THE FIELD OF HIS FAME FRESH AND GORY
THAT THROUGH THY PROWESS AND VICTORIOUS ARMS THY COUNTRY MAY BE FREED FROM FOREIGN HARMS AND GREAT ELIZA'S GLORIOUS NAME MAY RING THROUGH ALL THE WORLD FILL'D WITH THY WIDE ALARMS WHICH SOME BRAVE MUSE MAY SING TO AGES FOLLOWING

WHEN SOMETIME LOFTY TOWERS I SEE DOWN RAZED AND BRASS ETERNAL SLAVE TO MORTAL RAGE WHEN I HAVE SEEN THE HUNGRY OCEAN GAIN ADVANTAGE ON THE KINGDOM OF THE SHORE
FOR NEITHER WERE YE PLAYING ON THE STEEP WHERE YOUR OLD BARDS THE FAMOUS DRUIDS LIE NOR ON THE SHAGGY TOP OF MONA HIGH NOR YET WHERE DEVA SPREADS HER WIZARD STREAM AY ME
IF AUGHT OF OATEN STOP OR PASTORAL SONG MAY HOPE CHASTE EVE TO SOOTHE THY MODEST EAR LIKE THY OWN SOLEMN SPRINGS THY SPRINGS AND DYING GALES
FOR THERE I LOST MY FATHER DEAR MY FATHER DEAR AND BRETHREN THREE THEIR WINDING SHEET THE BLUIDY CLAY THEIR GRAVES ARE GROWING GREEN TO SEE AND BY THEM LIES THE DEAREST LAD THAT EVER BLEST A WOMAN'S EE

I FEEL THE WEIGHT OF CHANCE DESIRES MY HOPES NO MORE MUST CHANGE THEIR NAME I LONG FOR A REPOSE WHICH EVER IS THE SAME STERN LAWGIVER YET THOU DOST WEAR
LIKE LEVIATHANS AFLOAT LAY THEIR BULWARKS ON THE BRINE WHILE THE SIGN OF BATTLE FLEW ON THE LOFTY BRITISH LINE IT WAS TEN OF APRIL MORN BY THE CHIME
FOR THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE BOOK IN A SERIOUS AND SCHOLARLY SPIRIT THE FOLLOWING REMARKS ON THE PLAN AND THE EXECUTION ARE ADDED THE EDITOR IS ACQUAINTED WITH NO STRICT AND EXHAUSTIVE DEFINITION OF LYRICAL POETRY
WHILE GENJI PRIVATELY TOOK VIOLET WITH HIM IN A CLOSE CARRIAGE TO SEE THE FESTIVAL AND SAW THE HORSE RACES WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE MIND OF THE LADY OF ROKJIO WAS STILL WAVERING AND UNSETTLED
THE LADY WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A CHILD NOW TO PERFORM DUE THANKSGIVING FOR THIS HAPPY DELIVERANCE
LOCAL GOVERNORS WHO HAD BECOME RICH AND HAVING RETURNED FROM DIFFERENT PROVINCES SOUNDED THE PRINCESS TO SEE IF SHE WERE INCLINED TO PART WITH HER RESIDENCE BUT THIS SHE ALWAYS REFUSED TO DO SAYING THAT HOWEVER UNFORTUNATE SHE MIGHT BE
BUT IT IS SIMPLY FOOLISH TO ABANDON ONE'S SELF AND TO BURY ONE'S LIFE UNDER SUCH A MASS OF DILAPIDATION
IT MIGHT NOT GRATIFY YOU THE LATE LORD AZECHI DAINAGON DIED LONG AGO AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM WELL HIS WIDOW IS MY SISTER AND SINCE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH HER HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY
FEAR NOT THE DARKNESS I AM HERE SAID GENJI SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT TIMIDLY PRAY DO NOT THINK ME PRESUMPTUOUS SAID GENJI BUT MAY I BEG YOU TO TRANSMIT THIS POETICAL EFFUSION TO YOUR MISTRESS FOR ME
I DO NOT SEE THE REAL INTENT OF THE EFFUSION THOUGHT THE NUN PERHAPS HE THINKS THAT SHE IS ALREADY A WOMAN BUT SHE CONTINUED WONDERINGLY HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE YOUNG GRASS
BUT HE WAS A MAN OF ECCENTRIC CHARACTER AND WAS NOT VERY FLOURISHING IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH BEING THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH THE PRINCESS HITACHI THE GROUNDS OF HER MANSION BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE AND WILD
WHEN SHE ARRIVED THE PRIEST WAS INTENSELY DELIGHTED AND THE YOUNG MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN GRADUALLY IMPROVING IN HEALTH FELT GREAT CONSOLATION THE CHILD WAS VERY HEALTHY AND THE NURSE AT ONCE BEGAN TO DISCHARGE HER DUTIES MOST FAITHFULLY
HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE PRINCESS MOMO ZONO PEACH GARDENS HE HAD KNOWN HER LONG HE ADMIRED HER TOO SHE HAD BEEN A SPECTATOR WITH HER FATHER
WHO WAS BY NO MEANS DISTINGUISHED FOR HER BEAUTY AND WHO STILL BORE A MARK ON HER NOSE WHICH MIGHT REMIND ONE OF A WELL RIPENED FRUIT CARRIED BY MOUNTAINEERS HOW WAS THIS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREORDAINED TO BE SO
BUT THE PRINCESS STILL CLUNG TO THE HOPE THAT THE TIME WOULD COME WHEN GENJI WOULD REMEMBER HER AND RENEW HIS KINDNESS WINTER CAME ONE DAY QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE AUNT ARRIVED AT THE MANSION BRINGING AS A PRESENT A DRESS FOR THE PRINCESS
SHE THEN LEFT THE ROOM POSSIBLY TO LOOK FOR THE LOST BIRD THE PEOPLE WHO ADDRESSED HER CALLED HER SHIONAGON AND SHE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN THE LITTLE GIRL'S NURSE TO YOU SAID THE NUN TO THE GIRL
HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY AND RESPECT HIS RESIDENCE MOREOVER IS WELL APPOINTED AND OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE AND HE PERFORMS WITH PUNCTUALITY AND DEVOUTNESS HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES NAY ALMOST WITH MORE EARNESTNESS
BUT GENJI TOOK NO INTEREST IN THIS WHAT WILL HE EVENTUALLY DO ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE SAME AUTUMN GENJI WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF SUMIYOSHI TO FULFIL HIS VOWS
THUS AS THEY DEPICTED THEM TO HIM THEY CHEERED AND GLADDENED HIS MIND ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO SAY AMONG SUCH SIGHTS AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE IS THE SEA COAST OF AKASHI IN THE PROVINCE OF HARIMA WHICH IS I THINK ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
IF HIS DAUGHTER WERE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LADY AOI BUT THIS THE ROYAL MOTHER DID NOT APPROVE IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER FOR HER TO BE INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE SAID
AND SHE THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LAST THINKING IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT SHE GAVE ORALLY THE FOLLOWING REPLY TO THE ATTENDANT TO BE GIVEN TO GENJI YOU SAY YOUR SLEEVE IS WET WITH DEW
MY OWN HEART TELLS ME EVEN I RELUCTANT AM TO LEAVE IT NOW AND ON ANOTHER OF THESE PAPERS ACCOMPANYING THE WORDS THE WHITE FROST LIES UPON THE TILES THE FOLLOWING
WERE AMONG THE TOPICS OF THEIR CONSOLING CONVERSATION IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THAT A SOFT SHOWER OF RAIN WAS FALLING THE EVENING WAS RENDERED CHEERLESS
WOULD THAT I COULD SEE HER MORNING AND EVENING IN THE PALACE WHERE I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE FAIR LOVED ONE WHOM SHE RESEMBLES HE NOW RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY AND RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS SOON AFTER A DISCIPLE OF THE PRIEST CAME
SINCE FIRST THAT TENDER GRASS I VIEWED MY HEART NO SOFT REPOSE E'ER FEELS BUT GATHERING MIST MY SLEEVE BEDEWS AND PITY TO MY BOSOM STEALS SURELY YOU SHOULD KNOW SIR
WHICH WAS ALSO A GIRL AND ABOUT THIS GIRL THE GRANDMOTHER IS ALWAYS FEELING VERY ANXIOUS THEN SAID GENJI LET IT NOT APPEAR STRANGE TO YOU IF I SAY THIS BUT I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO BECOME THE GUARDIAN OF THIS GIRL
AND HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE SECRET OF MY EXORCISMS I WONDER WHY YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR ME SO SAYING HE PLEASINGLY EMBRACED HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF GREAT HOLINESS HE WROTE OUT A TALISMANIC PRESCRIPTION
SEVERAL PLACES WHICH ARE WELL SITUATED FOR QUIET RETIREMENT AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED INCONSISTENT IN HIM HAD HE PREFERRED A PART OF THE SEA COAST SO NEAR THE GAY WORLD NEVERTHELESS A RETREAT IN THE TOO REMOTE INTERIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SOLITARY
THEY CAME IN ALL HASTE WIPING OFF THE PERSPIRATION FROM THEIR FACES AS THEY JOURNEYED AND FROM THE EMPEROR AND ROYAL PRINCES DOWN TO THE ORDINARY NOBLES
AND THEY AT LAST MADE THEIR WAY AND TOOK UP THEIR POSITION PUSHING THE OTHER TWO BACK WHERE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN EVEN BREAKING THEIR POLES THE LADY SO MALTREATED WAS OF COURSE EXTREMELY INDIGNANT
ONLY I HEARD NOTHING FROM YOU SO I WAITED TILL NOW AND HERE I FIND MYSELF ONCE MORE THE PRINCESS AS USUAL SAID VERY LITTLE ONLY THANKING HIM FOR HIS VISIT HE THEN ADDRESSED HER IN MANY KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WORDS
ONE REASON WHY GENJI WAS SO MUCH ATTRACTED BY HER WAS THAT SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED A CERTAIN LADY IN THE PALACE TO WHOM HE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED THE NUN STROKED THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF THE CHILD AND MURMURED TO HERSELF
BUT THE PRINCE'S WIFE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND SEVERE SO SHE HAD MUCH TO SUFFER AND PUT UP WITH I SAW PERSONALLY THE TRUTH THAT CARE KILLS MORE THAN LABOR
THE FIFTH OF MAY WAS THE FIFTIETH DAY OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SO GENJI SENT A MESSENGER TO AKASHI A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD BE EXPECTED
BUT NOW HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SUCH THINGS MIGHT REALLY HAPPEN AND HE FELT DISTURBED YOU SPEAK THUS SAID GENJI AS IF HE WAS ADDRESSING THE SPIRIT BUT YOU DO NOT TELL ME WHO YOU ARE DO THEREFORE
HOW LONG IT SEEMS SINCE I SAW YOU HE EXCLAIMED VIOLET TURNED HER GLANCE A LITTLE ASIDE SHE WAS APPARENTLY SHY WHICH ONLY INCREASED HER BEAUTY HE APPROACHED
WHEN THEIR COUNTRY WAS IN A DISTURBED STATE CAME FORTH FROM THEIR RETREAT WITH THEIR SNOW CROWNED HEADS AND TOOK PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS NOR WAS IT AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A STATESMAN WHO HAD RETIRED FROM POLITICAL SCENES TO ASSUME AGAIN A PLACE UNDER ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
THE DEER TOO WHICH WERE TO BE SEEN HERE ADDED TO THE BEAUTY OF THE PICTURE GAZING AROUND AT THESE GENJI ONCE MORE PROCEEDED TO THE TEMPLE
THROUGH THE MOUTH OF A THIRD PERSON ALTHOUGH I THANK THE LADY FOR EVEN THAT MUCH I SHOULD FEEL MORE OBLIGED TO HER IF SHE WOULD GRANT ME AN INTERVIEW AND ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO HER MY SINCERE WISHES
AFTER HIS DEPARTURE SADAIJIN WENT INTO THE APARTMENT OCCUPIED TILL LATELY BY HIM THE ROOM WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE AND EVERYTHING WAS UNCHANGED BUT HIS ONLY DAUGHTER
LONG SINCE DEAD STILL HAUNTED THE MANSION AND MIGHT HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE LADY'S DELICATE HEALTH AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER
LADY AOI SELDOM SHOWED HERSELF ON SUCH OCCASIONS BESIDES SHE WAS NOW IN A DELICATE STATE OF HEALTH NEAR HER CONFINEMENT AND HAD THEREFORE NO INCLINATION TO GO OUT
THAT CLOUDY SHRINE WE VIEW ON HIGH WHERE MY LOST LOVE MAY DWELL UNSEEN LOOKS GLOOMY NOW TO THIS SAD EYE THAT LOOKS WITH TEARS ON WHAT HAS BEEN
AND DULY REPORTED IT TO GENJI WHO NOW FELT A PANG OF REMORSE FOR HIS LONG NEGLIGENCE OF ONE SO BADLY CIRCUMSTANCED HE DESCENDED FROM HIS CARRIAGE BUT THE PATHWAY WAS ALL BUT OVERGROWN WITH TALL MUGWORT WHICH WAS WET WITH A PASSING SHOWER
THE DEWS ARE SHED AS SADAIJIN WAS TURNING OVER THESE PAPERS A WITHERED FLOWER WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE MARKED SOME PARTICULAR OCCASION DROPPED FROM AMONGST THEM
SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
IN SHORT DOCTOR HART'S THEORY IS THAT HYPNOTISM COMES FROM CONTROLLING THE BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE BRAIN CUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY FROM PARTS OR INCREASING IT IN OTHER PARTS THIS THEORY IS BORNE OUT BY THE WELL KNOWN FACT THAT SOME PERSONS CAN BLUSH OR TURN PALE AT WILL
INVISIBLE TO THE HYPNOTIC SUBJECT ON A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER AND YET CAUSE HIM TO LOOK FIXEDLY AT A DOT ON THE PAPER ON OR NEAR THE RED CROSS HE WILLS ON TRANSFERRING HIS EYE TO THE BLANK SHEET SEE A BLUISH GREEN AFTER IMAGE OF THE CROSS
SUCH AS OPIUM OR WE MAY INDUCE HALLUCINATIONS BY INTRODUCING INTO THE BLOOD OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES SUCH AS INDIAN HEMP OR STRAMONIUM WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF THE MECHANISM PRODUCING THE ARTERIAL CONTRACTION
BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
OR IF IT BE SUBJECTED TO LOCAL PRESSURE THE PART OF THE BRAIN SO ACTED UPON CEASES TO BE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING ITS FUNCTIONS THE REGULARITY OF THE ACTION OF THE BRAIN AND THE SANITY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE THOUGHT
MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
NOW I AM GOING TO CUT YOUR LEG OFF BUT IT WILL NOT HURT YOU IN THE LEAST AND THE PATIENT SUFFERS NOTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES OF HARVARD COLLEGE
HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
AND POSSIBLY PREY UPON THE POCKETS OF A CREDULOUS AND WONDER LOVING PUBLIC SUCH NAMES AS MESMERIC CONDITION MAGNETIC SLEEP CLAIRVOYANCE ELECTRO BIOLOGY ANIMAL MAGNETISM FAITH TRANCE AND MANY OTHER ALIASES
AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
VESUVIUS OR FUSIYAMA OR STILL HOTTER PLACES MAY BE PRODUCED OR DREAMS OF ADVENTURE ON FROZEN SURFACES OR IN ARCTIC REGIONS MAY BE CREATED BY APPLYING ICE TO THE FEET OF THE SLEEPER
WE MAY INTRODUCE A VOLATILE SUBSTANCE SUCH AS CHLOROFORM AND ITS FIRST EFFECT WILL BE TO ABOLISH CONSCIOUSNESS AND INDUCE PROFOUND SLUMBER AND A BLESSED INSENSIBILITY TO PAIN THE LIKE EFFECTS WILL FOLLOW MORE SLOWLY UPON THE ABSORPTION OF A DRUG
THAT PERSONAL INFLUENCE WHICH WE ALL EXERT AT VARIOUS TIMES AND WHICH HE IGNORES NOT BECAUSE HE WOULD DENY IT BUT BECAUSE HE FEARS LENDING COUNTENANCE TO THE MAGNETIC FLUID AND OTHER SIMILAR THEORIES SAYS HE
THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF HYPNOTISM DOCTOR HART'S THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS BOOK THE READER WILL FIND A SUMMARY OF THE THEORIES OF HYPNOTISM
IN A LIKE MANNER IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE COMA AND PROLONGED INSENSIBILITY BY PRESSURE OF THE THUMBS ON THE CAROTID OR HALLUCINATION DREAMS AND VISIONS BY DRUGS OR BY EXTERNAL STIMULATION OF THE NERVES
WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
TRY TO THINK OF NOTHING AND HAPPILY WE GENERALLY SUCCEED MORE OR LESS WELL SOME PEOPLE POSSESS AN EVEN MORE MARKED CONTROL OVER THIS MECHANISM OF SLEEP I CAN GENERALLY SUCCEED IN PUTTING MYSELF TO SLEEP AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY EITHER IN THE LIBRARY CHAIR OR IN THE BROUGHAM
OR TO ANY INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISES UPON INANIMATE OBJECTS DISTANCE DOES NOT AFFECT IT NOR PROXIMITY NOR THE INTERVENTION OF ANY CONDUCTORS OR NON CONDUCTORS WHETHER SILK OR GLASS OR STONE OR EVEN A BRICK WALL
AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
OR PERHAPS ONLY A SHUDDERING AND SKIN CONTRACTION KNOWN AS GOOSE SKIN THE IRRITATION OF THE NERVE END IN THE SKIN HAS CARRIED A MESSAGE TO THE INVOLUNTARY OR VOLUNTARY GANGLIA OF THE BRAIN WHICH HAS RESPONDED BY REFLECTING BACK AGAIN NERVE IMPULSES
BUT WHICH IT WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO DEVELOP FULLY AT PRESENT MOST PEOPLE KNOW SOMETHING OF WHAT IS MEANT BY REFLEX ACTION THE NERVES WHICH PASS FROM THE VARIOUS ORGANS TO THE BRAIN
REPORTS THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS MAKE A STROKE ON A PAPER OR BLACKBOARD AND TELL THE SUBJECT IT IS NOT THERE AND HE WILL SEE NOTHING BUT THE CLEAN PAPER OR BOARD NEXT HE NOT LOOKING
THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
BEING VERY CAREFUL TO PLACE IT ON ITS FORMER SPOT BOTH ALICE AND GLENCORA COULD SEE THAT A MAN AT HIS ELBOW WAS DISSUADING HIM HAD EVEN ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE ARM WHICH HELD THE RAKE
WHEN ALL WAS COUNTED IT WAS NOT SO VERY MUCH THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD MAKE HIM A NEW MAN AND WHAT WAS SUCH A SUM AS THAT TO HIS WEALTHY WIDOW INDEED FOR A WOMAN WANTING A HUSBAND OF THAT SORT
AND HE TRIED TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT HE SHOULD HIDE HIS WRATH TILL AFTER PROVISION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THIS OTHER ELECTION THEY WERE HIS ENEMIES ALICE AND MISTER GREY AND WHY SHOULD HE KEEP ANY TERMS WITH HIS ENEMIES
BUT THIS MAN LET HIS GOLD GO ALL TOGETHER AND LEFT IT WHERE HIS HALF STRETCHED RAKE DEPOSITED IT BY CHANCE ALICE COULD NOT BUT LOOK AT HIS FACE HIS EYES SHE COULD SEE WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS HAIR
IN THE WAY OF COURTING THEY WERE VERY PERSISTENT NO DOUBT BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND HER
AND OF THOSE WHO WERE TRIUMPHANT TO KNOW HOW THE THING WAS DONE AND TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THAT LESSON IN LIFE LET US STAND HERE A MOMENT SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND ARRESTING HIM AT ONE CORNER OF THE TABLE WHICH HAD THE GREATEST CROWD
WHO LOOKED BACK UPON HER PAST LIFE WITH CONTENTMENT AND FORWARD TO HER FUTURE LIFE WITH CONFIDENCE SHE WOULD NOT BE GREEDY SHE SAID TO HERSELF SHE DID NOT WANT MORE MONEY AND THEREFORE SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF MISTER CHEESACRE
IF HE MARRIED ALICE HE WOULD DO SO WITH NO IDEA OF CHEATING HER OUT OF HER MONEY SHE SHOULD LEARN NAY SHE HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM HIS OWN LIPS HOW PERILOUS WAS HIS ENTERPRISE BUT HE KNEW HER TO BE A WOMAN WHO WOULD BOLDLY RISK ALL IN MONEY
YES VANQUISHED IF YOU LIKE TO CALL IT SO SAID ALICE IT IS NOT WHAT I CALL IT BUT WHAT YOU FEEL IT SAID THE OTHER DO YOU THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT YOU REGARD YOURSELF NOW
AND AS HE HAD GROWN OLDER THE MOMENTS OF HIS QUIXOTISM HAD BECOME MORE RARE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SUCH QUIXOTISM LEFT WITH HIM NOW HAD NOT THE VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE FILLED HIM DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
AND AS FOR MONEY WHAT'S THE GOOD OF HAVING MORE THAN ENOUGH IF HE CAN BRING LOVE YOU CAN BRING MONEY CAN'T YOU MA'AM HE'S NOTHING TO ME GIRL REPEATED MISSUS GREENOW BUT HE WILL BE SAID JEANNETTE PLAINLY ASKING A QUESTION WELL I'M SURE
TO THIS SHE MADE HIM NO ANSWER THERE'S A PRIDE ABOUT ME HE CONTINUED THAT I DON'T CHOOSE TO GO WHERE I'M NOT WANTED I CAN'T TELL YOU MISTER CHEESACRE THAT YOU ARE WANTED IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEN I'LL GO
IS IT HE IN TRUTH ALICE ASKED IN VERY TRUTH SAID GLENCORA WHAT CAN I DO CAN I DO ANYTHING LOOK AT HIM ALICE
THEY BOTH WALKED TO THE END OF THE ROW OF BUILDINGS AND THEN BURGO LEAVING THE BROAD WAY TURNED INTO A LITTLE PATH WHICH LED UP THROUGH THE TREES TO THE HILLS THAT HILLSIDE AMONG THE TREES IS A POPULAR RESORT AT BADEN DURING THE DAY
MISTER PALLISER HAD BEEN AFRAID TO BE IMPERIOUS AND THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ARRIVAL AT ONE OF THE STATIONS IN BASLE HE HAD POSTED ACROSS THE TOWN IN THE HEAT AND THE DUST
OR WHETHER THERE WAS ABOUT HIS HEART ANY TOUCH OF MANLY REGRET
UPON THE WHOLE I THINK THAT SHE WAS LUCKY IN HER CHOICE OR PERHAPS I MIGHT MORE TRULY SAY THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN WITH PRUDENCE HE WAS NO FORGER OR THIEF IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD
IT WAS WELL FOR HER THAT HE WHO WAS TO BE CAPTAIN WAS ONE WHOM SHE RESPECTED AS THOROUGHLY AS SHE LOVED HIM SHE WOULD WRITE TO HER FATHER AT ONCE TO HER FATHER AND LADY MACLEOD AND WOULD CONFESS EVERYTHING
MISTER GREY SHOULD ORDER IT THEN SHE LAUGHED AT HERSELF AGAIN WITH THAT INWARD LAUGHTER AND RISING FROM HER SEAT PROCEEDED TO WALK DOWN THE HILL TO THE HOTEL VANQUISHED AT LAST SAID LADY GLENCORA AS ALICE ENTERED THE ROOM
ALL MIGHT SEE THAT HE LEFT ITS POSITION TO CHANCE ONE PIECE HAD GOT BEYOND ITS BOUNDARY AND THE CROUPIER PUSHED IT BACK WITH SOME HALF EXPRESSED INQUIRY AS TO HIS CORRECTNESS ALL RIGHT
AND THERE'LL BE ALL MY THINGS TO SEE TO BEFORE THAT SO JEANNETTE GOT UP AND DEPARTED AND AFTER SOME FEW FURTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT CAPTAIN BELLFIELD MISSUS GREENOW HERSELF WENT TO HER BEDROOM MISTER CHEESACRE
MISTER PALLISER AS HE TOOK HIS PLACE OPPOSITE HIS WIFE WAS VERY TRIUMPHANT AND MISTER GREY WAS TRIUMPHANT AS HE PLACED HIMSELF GENTLY IN HIS SEAT OPPOSITE TO ALICE
AND JEANNETTE PROBABLY IN TOKEN OF CONTRITION PUT HER APRON TO HERS TO BE SURE MA'AM NO LADY COULD HAVE BEHAVED BETTER THROUGH IT THAN YOU HAVE DONE AND GOODNESS KNOWS YOU HAVE BEEN TRIED HARD INDEED I HAVE JEANNETTE
YOU CANNOT ACCUSE MY LOVE SINCE THE TIME IN WHICH I MIGHT SIT WITH MY ARM ROUND YOUR WAIST I HAVE SAT WITH IT ROUND NO OTHER WAIST SINCE YOUR LIPS WERE MINE NO OTHER LIPS HAVE BEEN DEAR TO ME SINCE YOU WERE MY COUNSELLOR I HAVE HAD NO OTHER COUNSELLOR
AND A SECOND CLASS COMPARTMENT CLOSE TO THEM FOR THE PALLISER SERVANTS MISTER PALLISER AS HE SLOWLY HANDED HIS WIFE IN WAS A TRIUMPHANT MAN AS WAS ALSO MISTER GREY AS HE HANDED IN HIS LADY LOVE
THOUGH THEY WERE THE GRAND DUCHESS'S DIAMOND EARDROPS HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO GET THEM FOR HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE QUAFFED MOLTEN PEARLS LIKE CLEOPATRA HE WOULD HAVE PROCURED THE BEVERAGE
WHAT IN WESTMORELAND SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH SOMETHING OF DISMAY IN HIS TONE WHAT ON EARTH WOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF ALL HIS LIFE IN THAT GLOOMY PLACE YES IN WESTMORELAND WHY NOT IN WESTMORELAND AS WELL AS ANYWHERE ELSE
HAD TAUGHT HIMSELF SOME THEORIES OF A PECULIAR NATURE BUT NEVERTHELESS AS HE THOUGHT OF ALICE VAVASOR ON THIS OCCASION HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT IF A SIAMESE TWIN WERE NECESSARY FOR HIM SHE OF ALL OTHERS WAS THE WOMAN TO WHOM HE WOULD WISH TO BE SO BOUND
AS SHE DID SO HER FRIEND ENJOYED IT WITH HER AND AT LAST THEY HAD SOMETHING OF THE COMFORT AND EXCITEMENT WHICH SUCH AN OCCASION SHOULD GIVE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ALICE YOU SHALL COME AND BE MARRIED AT MATCHING IN AUGUST OR PERHAPS SEPTEMBER
THEN WHEN THE HOUR WAS NEARLY OVER HE READ IT AGAIN I'LL BET TWO TO ONE THAT SHE GIVES WAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE PUT THE SHEET OF PAPER BACK INTO THE ENVELOPE WOMEN ARE SUCH OUT AND OUT FOOLS THEN HE TOOK HIS CANDLE AND CARRYING HIS LETTER WITH HIM WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM
IF THINGS WERE REALLY FIXED HE NEVER BEGRUDGED ANY MAN HIS CHANCE THINGS ARE REALLY FIXED SAID MISSUS GREENOW
FOR WHOM HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO DO SOMETHING IF THE DOING OF ANYTHING WERE ONLY IN HIS POWER AND HE HAD IN HIS POCKET A LETTER WHICH HE HAD THAT MORNING RECEIVED FROM THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY MARKED PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
SAID CHEESACRE MISSUS GREENOW TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID LOOK AT IT IN THAT LIGHT
AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND AT ONCE THAT IF THE QUARREL WERE FORCED UPON HIM IT SHOULD FIND HIM READY TO TAKE HIS OWN PART MY DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING IT COMES FROM CONSIDERATION FOR YOU HE SAID
PROVIDENCE HAS HITHERTO BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME IN NOT HAVING MADE THAT LOSS IRREMEDIABLE BY YOUR MARRIAGE WITH MISTER GREY I WISH YOU NOW TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WELL AND TO TELL ME WHETHER YOU CAN PARDON ME AND STILL LOVE ME
AND THAT ON WHICH THEIR EYES FELL LAST AS LADY GLENCORA STOOD SHE COULD HARDLY SEE INDEED AT FIRST SHE COULD NOT SEE
HE DID NOT TRY TO HIDE HIS ANXIETY AND WHEN AFTER THE TELLING OF SOME SIX OR SEVEN CARDS HE HEARD A CERTAIN NUMBER NAMED AND A CERTAIN COLOUR CALLED HE MADE SOME EXCLAMATION WHICH EVEN GLENCORA COULD NOT HEAR
WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AND MARRIED HIM SINCE YESTERDAY HE ONLY HAD TWENTY FOUR HOURS START OF ME I KNOW
THE SAME GIG WHICH HAD BROUGHT BELLFIELD TO VAVASOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND SEATED IN THE GIG LOOMING LARGE WITH HIS EYES WIDE AWAKE TO EVERYTHING ROUND HIM WAS MISTER CHEESACRE
YOURS B F VAVASOR THEREFORE HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO SPENT HIS CHRISTMAS MORNING IN CALLING ON MISTER MAGRUIN
BE AN END TO HER PRIDE TO THAT PRIDE WHICH HAD HITHERTO TAUGHT HER TO THINK THAT SHE COULD MORE WISELY FOLLOW HER OWN GUIDANCE THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER WHO MIGHT CLAIM TO GUIDE HER SHE KNEW NOW THAT SHE MUST FOLLOW HIS GUIDANCE
HE WILL LIKE IT BETTER I DARE SAY IF YOU WILL SIT UPON HIS KNEE SOME PENITENTS DO YOU KNOW AND HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE HE'LL NEVER EXPLAIN THE SUGAR DUTIES TO YOU AND THERE'LL BE NO MISTER BOTT AT NETHERCOATS
WILL YOU BE MY WIFE I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED
THAT SHE HAD IN SOBER TRUTH TOLD THIS ARDENT GENTLEMAN THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM AND EVEN AS TO KATE KATE WHOM HER AUNT HAD ABSURDLY CHOSEN TO REGARD AS THE OBJECT OF MISTER CHEESACRE'S PURSUIT
BUT THE MOST STRIKING PROTEST AGAINST THE COERCIVE MEASURES FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT OF MAJOR ANDERSON HIMSELF THE LETTER IN WHICH HIS VIEWS WERE EXPRESSED HAS BEEN CAREFULLY SUPPRESSED IN THE PARTISAN NARRATIVES OF THAT PERIOD AND WELLNIGH LOST SIGHT OF
WHICH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAD REFUSED TO EVACUATE PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCLAMATION THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS DESIGNATED IN THE PROCLAMATION AS A COMBINATION TOO POWERFUL TO BE SUPPRESSED BY THE ORDINARY COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
PAYABLE IN SPECIE WERE PLEDGED A REVIEW OF THIS STATEMENT OF THE LEGISLATION OF CONGRESS WILL CLEARLY PRESENT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE GOVERNMENT THE FIRST ACTION OF THE PROVISIONAL CONGRESS WAS CONFINED TO THE ADOPTION OF A TARIFF LAW
LOANS AUTHORIZED NOTES AND BONDS FUNDING NOTES TREASURY NOTES GUARANTEED BY THE STATES MEASURE TO REDUCE THE CURRENCY
WAS SHOWN BY THEIR ADOPTION OF A CONSTITUTION SO LITTLE DIFFERING FROM THE INSTRUMENT OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IT WAS AGAINST THE VIOLATIONS OF THAT INSTRUMENT
MY ASSAILANTS HAVE SOUGHT TO COVER THEIR EXPOSURE BY A CHANGE OF TIME AND PLACE LOCATING THEIR STORY AT FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE
TO MAINTAIN ITS LIFE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THE PASSIONS THAT RULE THE SAVAGE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE AUTHORITIES AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL IN THE CONFLAGRATIONS OF VAST STRUCTURES THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC PROPERTY
THE DELIBERATIONS IN COMMON WILL OFFER NO VIOLENCE TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF EACH MEMBER THOUGH THEY MAY IN CERTAIN RESPECTS
WAS IMPOSED ON ALL COTTON EXPORTED IN THE RAW STATE AT THE SECOND SESSION IN MAY A COMPLETE TARIFF LAW WAS ENACTED WITH A LOWER SCALE OF DUTIES THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED ON AUGUST NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
AND IN THIS STATE OF THE CASE I CALL UPON THE SENATE TO AFFIRM THE GREAT PRINCIPLES ON WHICH OUR INSTITUTIONS REST IN NO SPIRIT OF CRIMINATION HAVE I STATED THE REASONS WHY I PRESENT IT
TO MAKE A LOAN OF FIFTY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BONDS AND NOTES AND TO HOLD AN ELECTION FOR OFFICERS OF THE PERMANENT GOVERNMENT UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS ALSO PASSED TO PROVIDE REVENUE FROM IMPORTS ANOTHER RELATIVE TO PRISONERS OF WAR
AND YOU HAVE NO PAST ASSOCIATIONS TO DISTURB THE JUDGMENT TO BE PASSED UPON THE VIEWS PRESENTED I HAVE MADE AND AM MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO THE PRACTICABILITY OF GETTING A CORPS OF NEGROES FOR LABORERS
NOW IT HAPPENS THAT THESE VERY TERMS COMPACT CONFEDERACY ACCEDE AND THE LIKE WERE THE TERMS IN FAMILIAR USE BY THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEIR ASSOCIATES WITH REFERENCE TO THAT INSTRUMENT AND ITS RATIFICATION
SIR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES HAS HITHERTO FORBORNE FROM ANY HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION AGAINST FORT SUMTER IN THE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A VIEW TO THE AMICABLE ADJUSTMENT OF ALL QUESTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS
TO BE DECIDED BY THE PROPER AND COMPETENT TRIBUNAL THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES APPENDIX TO CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED IN QUESTION BY THE MODERN SCHOOL OF CONSOLIDATION THESE GENTLEMEN ADMIT THAT THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION WAS A COMPACT
THESE BONDS COULD BE EXCHANGED FOR SPECIE MILITARY AND NAVAL STORES OR FOR THE PROCEEDS OF RAW PRODUCE AND MANUFACTURED ARTICLES ON DECEMBER NINETEENTH TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TREASURY NOTES
ALL DUTIES IMPOSTS AND EXCISES SHOULD BE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATES OF THE CONFEDERACY
WAS THE VERY LANGUAGE THEY FAMILIARLY USED
A FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF THE COMPACT OF UNION AFTER ITS CONDITIONS HAD BEEN DELIBERATELY AND PERSISTENTLY BROKEN AND THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES INDICATED FURTHER
WERE AUTHORIZED AND MADE EXCHANGEABLE FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE TREASURY NOTES ALL THESE NOTES AND BONDS WERE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THOSE OF THE ACTS OF AUGUST NINETEENTH AND DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
WERE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS OF ANY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN BEFORE THE FACT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR ADVANCING IN THIS SAME GENERAL LINE OF THOUGHT THE CONGRESS IN ENACTING TERRITORIAL BILLS LEFT OUT A PROVISION
AND SAY HERE IS WHAT WE DEMAND HERE OUR WRONGS ARE ENUMERATED UPON THESE TERMS WE HAVE AGREED AND NOW AFTER WE HAVE GIVEN YOU A REASONABLE TIME TO CONSIDER THESE ADDITIONAL GUARANTEES IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THESE WRONGS
NEW HAMPSHIRE IN HER CONSTITUTION AS REVISED IN SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO HAD IDENTICALLY THE SAME DECLARATION EXCEPT AS REGARDS THE NAME OF THE STATE AND THE WORD STATE INSTEAD OF COMMONWEALTH MISTER MADISON
AND TO INDICATE AND EXERCISE THEIR WILL UPON IT BY THE ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE ENSUING LEGISLATURE WHOSE VIEWS UPON THE SUBJECT WOULD BE KNOWN AND WITH SUCH INSTRUCTIONS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AS THEY MIGHT THINK PROPER TO GIVE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN
OR NEW ORLEANS IF AT WAR AT POINTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY WITHIN TEN MILES OF A RAILROAD OR A STREAM NAVIGABLE TO THE OCEAN THE DELIVERY WAS TO BE MADE FREE OF ALL CHARGES EXCEPT THE EXPORT DUTY OF ONE EIGHTH OF ONE CENT PER POUND
A MONTHLY ISSUE OF TREASURY NOTES WITHOUT INTEREST TO THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALSO AUTHORIZED THESE WERE MADE FUNDABLE DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THEIR ISSUE IN SIX PER CENT
WHICH IT WAS PRESENTED TO EXCUSE THE FACT BEING THAT A STATE AND NOT AN UNLAWFUL COMBINATION AS ASSERTED WAS THE OBJECT OF ASSAULT
THE ISSUES OF TREASURY NOTES WERE INCREASED UNTIL IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE CURRENCY IN CIRCULATION AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
CAN NOW ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE OPERATION OF AN OPINION WHICH COVERS THE EXACT POLITICAL QUESTION WHICH IT WAS KNOWN BEFOREHAND THE COURT WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO DECIDE
AND ONE OF THE COMPROMISES WHICH WAS MADE WAS AN APPELLATE POWER TO LODGE POWER IN THE SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE ALL QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BUT DID THIS OMISSION OF THE OBLIGATION TO SEND HERE THE LAWS OF THE TERRITORIES
THE BOLD STAND THEN AND THEREAFTER TAKEN EXTORTED A PROMISE FROM THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES THAT NO MORE TROOPS SHOULD BE SENT THROUGH THE CITY OF BALTIMORE WHICH PROMISE HOWEVER
MY CORRESPONDENCE OF ANTERIOR DATE MIGHT HAVE SHOWN THAT I WAS FULLY AWARE OF IT AND MY SUGGESTIONS IN THE INTERVIEW CERTAINLY DID NOT LOOK AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO IMPRESS ME WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF ACTION
TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES FREELY TENDERED THE USE OF THEIR LINES FOR TROOPS AND SUPPLIES REQUISITIONS FOR TROOPS WERE MET WITH SUCH ALACRITY THAT THE NUMBER OFFERING THEIR SERVICES IN EVERY INSTANCE GREATLY EXCEEDED THE DEMAND
IT COULD NOT ABANDON ITS TRUST AND WHEN IT OMITTED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LAWS SHOULD BE SENT BACK IT CREATED A CASUS WHICH REQUIRED IT TO ACT WITHOUT THE OFFICIAL RECORDS BEING LAID BEFORE IT
AS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION AND EVER SINCE SHE HELD THE AFRICAN IN BONDAGE THIS IS PART OF THE HISTORY AND MARKS THE NECESSITY OF THE TIMES
WOULD PRODUCE MOST DISASTROUS RESULTS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY IT IS OF COURSE NOW TOO LATE FOR ME TO GIVE ANY ADVICE IN REFERENCE TO THE PROPOSED SCHEME OF CAPTAIN FOX I FEAR THAT ITS RESULT
THE POWERS OVER PERSON AND PROPERTY OF WHICH WE SPEAK ARE NOT ONLY NOT GRANTED TO CONGRESS BUT ARE IN EXPRESS TERMS DENIED AND THEY ARE FORBIDDEN TO EXERCISE THEM AND THIS PROHIBITION IS NOT CONFINED TO THE STATES
WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AND THE ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE SOVEREIGN STATES UNDER THE PRETEXT OF PRESERVING THE UNION WAS ALIKE OFFENSIVE TO LAW TO GOOD MORALS
I WILL NOW PROCEED TO NOTICE THE ALLEGATION THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR INACTION BY THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC IN THE LATTER PART OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
WE ARE IN ARMS TO RENEW SUCH SACRIFICES AS OUR FOREFATHERS MADE TO THE HOLY CAUSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY
THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT NEAR ITS CLOSE IS VERY CORRECTLY REPRESENTED IN THE REPORT OF THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS OF THE TREASURY FOR THE TWO QUARTERS
WHICH HAD BEEN PLEADING FOR PEACE AND STILL STOOD ON THE DEFENSIVE
REPRESENTATIVES AND DIRECT TAXES SHALL BE APPORTIONED AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NUMBERS WHICH SHALL BE DETERMINED BY ADDING TO THE WHOLE NUMBER OF FREE PERSONS INCLUDING THOSE BOUND TO SERVICE FOR A TERM OF YEARS AND EXCLUDING INDIANS NOT TAXED
L P WALKER SECRETARY OF WAR
BUT THAT CONTINUAL REPETITION OF BATTLES SO EXTREMELY LIKE ONE ANOTHER THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR
WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
DIE AWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF AN EUNUCH QUAVERING THE ROLE OF CAESAR OR OF CATO AND STRUTTING AWKWARDLY UPON THE STAGE FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS
THE GIRL BLUSHED
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
ALAS I KNOW NOT WHETHER I HAVE MADE THEIR FORTUNES THIS I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NOT MADE MINE DOGS MONKEYS AND PARROTS ARE A THOUSAND TIMES LESS WRETCHED THAN I THE DUTCH FETICHES WHO HAVE CONVERTED ME
IMPOSSIBLE TO TREAT ONE'S RELATIONS IN A MORE BARBAROUS MANNER
THE TWO SHEEP WERE PUT ON BOARD CANDIDE FOLLOWED IN A LITTLE BOAT TO JOIN THE VESSEL IN THE ROADS THE SKIPPER SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY SET SAIL AND PUT OUT TO SEA THE WIND FAVOURING HIM
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL WELL SAID CANDIDE I FIND THAT I SHALL BE THE ONLY HAPPY MAN WHEN I AM BLESSED WITH THE SIGHT OF MY DEAR CUNEGONDE IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO HOPE SAID MARTIN
HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS
TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
TO COAST ALONG PORTUGAL AND SPAIN TO CROSS THE WHOLE MEDITERRANEAN
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
AND IN HIS DISTRESS HE KNOCKED OVER LOUDLY AT THE DOOR
AND DROPPING A FEW TEARS NO SOONER HAD SHE SET FOOT IN CANDIDE'S APARTMENT THAN SHE CRIED OUT
HE HAD INDEED ENDURED MISFORTUNES A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE
THEY SAW TWO SHIPS IN CLOSE FIGHT ABOUT THREE MILES OFF THE WIND BROUGHT BOTH SO NEAR TO THE FRENCH VESSEL THAT OUR TRAVELLERS HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE FIGHT AT THEIR EASE
HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM FOR A WRITER WHO HAS SPOILED TASSO'S HELL AND THE DEVIL
HIS INSIPID LAVINIA I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING CANDIDE'S MELANCHOLY INCREASED
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
THE JUDGE SET ME FREE ON CONDITION THAT HE SUCCEEDED THE SURGEON
OUR TRAVELLERS SPENT THE FIRST DAY VERY AGREEABLY THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH POSSESSING MORE TREASURE THAN ALL ASIA EUROPE AND AFRICA COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER
WHILE SPEAKING HE SAW HE KNEW NOT WHAT OF A SHINING RED SWIMMING CLOSE TO THE VESSEL THEY PUT OUT THE LONG BOAT TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE IT WAS ONE OF HIS SHEEP
THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AND UTTERED TERRIBLE OUTCRIES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA WELL SAID MARTIN THIS IS HOW MEN TREAT ONE ANOTHER
AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
I CONCLUDED THAT I KNEW AS MUCH AS HE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF A GUIDE TO LEARN IGNORANCE HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
THEY HAD BOTH SEEN AND SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
BOTH CASES HAVE HAPPENED TO ME THIS IS THE PRICE AT WHICH YOU EAT SUGAR IN EUROPE
MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
UPON CONDITION THAT THIS MAN WAS THE MOST DISSATISFIED WITH HIS STATE AND THE MOST UNFORTUNATE IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE SUCH A CROWD OF CANDIDATES PRESENTED THEMSELVES THAT A FLEET OF SHIPS COULD HARDLY HAVE HELD THEM
YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
THE RESOLUTION WAS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE OF WHICH HE WAS CHAIRMAN AND A REPORT WAS MADE IN FAVOR OF THE MEASURE THIS LED TO THE CONVENTION OF ANNAPOLIS AND THE SUBSEQUENT ADOPTION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
DAVID DUDLEY FIELD AND EMINENT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS HEWITT BEING CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AT THE TIME DID ALL IN THEIR POWER TO INDUCE MISTER TILDEN TO ISSUE A LETTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE PRESIDENT ELECT
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR HE MADE AN EXTENSIVE TOUR IN THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN STATES AND IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE AFTER AN EXCURSION THROUGH NEW ENGLAND HE SAILED FOR EUROPE
BUT IT WAS AS EASY FOR THIS NATURAL MECHANIC TO CONCEIVE THE IDEA OF DRAINING THIS TRACT OF LAND AS IT WAS TO CONCEIVE METHODS TO RAISE BUILDINGS A VERY LARGE FORCE OF MEN WERE PUT TO WORK DRAINING GAS PIPES WERE LAID
WE HAVE MET WITH GREAT MISFORTUNES AND ARE LIKELY TO LOSE OUR CHURCH THERE ARE MORE THAN SIXTY MEMBERS OF MY CHURCH THAT VOTED FOR YOU FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE READY TO VOTE FOR YOU AGAIN
AS A STUDENT BUT WHILE AT THE ANVIL AT WORK AS A BLACKSMITH WITH BOOK LAYING ON A DESK NEAR HE FRAMED THE BASIS OF THAT CLASSICAL LEARNING WHICH MADE HIM AS MASTER OF FORTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE BAR IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN IN HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR WHILE YET A YOUNG LAWYER HE WAS MADE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF HARRISON COUNTY
THURLOW WEED NEVER HAD THE ADVANTAGES OF A COLLEGE BUT STRETCHED PRONE BEFORE THE SAP HOUSE FIRE HE LAID THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH HE BUILT THAT SPLENDID REPUTATION AS AN ABLE EDITOR ELIHU BURITT NEVER SAW THE INSIDE OF A COLLEGE SCHOOL ROOM
FROM THE BEGINNING HE WAS A CALCULATOR MARTIN VAN BUREN TO WHOM HE WAS GREATLY ATTACHED OFTEN SPOKE OF HIM AS THE SAGACIOUS SAMMY THROWN INTO CONTACT WITH SUCH MEN AT HIS PARENT'S HOME
EXCITED ANEW THE DISPLEASURE OF THE CABINET AND IN AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX HE WAS RECALLED UNDER AN INFORMAL CENSURE ON HIS RETURN TO AMERICA HE PUBLISHED A
HIS EYE LOST EVERY PARTICLE OF LUSTRE AND SEEMED TO SINK BACK AND DOWN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE STATED THE POINT HE HAD IN VIEW MISTER TILDEN ASKED HIM TO RESTATE IT ONCE OR TWICE MADE CURIOUS AND INCONSEQUENTIAL REMARKS
AND YET THIS IS A CITY OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT MUDDLED WITH DRINK THEY ARE PROMPTLY PAID THEIR PERSONAL RIGHTS ARE NOT INTERFERED WITH SAVE IN RESPECT TO THE SELLING OF LIQUOR THEY ARE CONTENTED AND HAPPY
BEING BORN IN THE WESTERN PART OF NEW YORK MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE HIS FATHER WAS A MECHANIC OF SOME NOTE BUT DIED BEFORE GEORGE WAS OF AGE LEAVING HIM TO HELP SUPPORT HIS MOTHER AND YOUNGER BROTHERS
AND DISORDER FOLLOWING THAT UNEXPECTED ASSAULT UPON THE LIFE OF THE REPUBLIC TO HAVE EQUIPPED FED CLOTHED AND ORGANIZED A MILLION AND A HALF OF SOLDIERY
JOHN JAY HAD BEEN SENT TO NEGOTIATE A TREATY WITH ENGLAND AND THE COURSE PURSUED BY MONROE WAS CONSIDERED INJUDICIOUS AS TENDING TO THROW SERIOUS OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE TREATY HIS ALLEGED FAILURE TO PRESENT IT IN ITS TRUE CHARACTER TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
GROPING ON IN MIDNIGHT DARKNESS BUT TO RETURN TO STANTON WHETHER HE POSSESSED A SLUMBERING GENIUS DOES NOT APPEAR BUT CERTAIN IT IS THAT BY DOWN RIGHT HARD WORK HE GAINED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW
WHOM HE ALSO KNEW DID YOU EVER SEE THE OLD MAN SO NEARLY GONE AS HE WAS TO DAY DOES HE OFTEN GET SO HAD HE BEEN TAKING A DROP TOO MUCH HE WAS AT NO TIME IN HIS CAREER EMBARRASSED IN HIS INTELLECTUAL OPERATIONS BY HIS EMOTIONAL NATURE
THE MISUNDERSTANDING CEASED AND MONROE WITHDREW FROM THE CANVASS IN EIGHTEEN TEN HE WAS AGAIN ELECTED TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA AND IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN ONCE MORE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE IN THE SAME YEAR HE WAS APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE BY PRESIDENT MADISON
THAT THEY WERE VERY HIGHLY APPRECIATED HE NOW WENT TO COLORADO AND ENGAGED IN VARIOUS MINING SCHEMES BUT HERE HE WAS OUT OF HIS SPHERE
APPEARED LIKE A MAN JUST GOING TO SLEEP AND FINALLY SAID I WILL SEE YOU ON THE SUBJECT ON A FUTURE OCCASION THE COMMITTEE WITHDREW IN ONE MOMENT HE RESUMED THE CONVERSATION WITH THE BRILLIANCY AND VIVACITY OF A BOY SUBSEQUENTLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE SAID TO THE LEADING REPUBLICAN
HIS FIRST APPEARANCE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WAS IN DEFENCE OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AGAINST THE WHEELING AND BELMONT BRIDGE COMPANY AND THEREAFTER HIS PRACTICE RAPIDLY INCREASED
AND HIS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE OVERTHROW OF THAT GIGANTIC RING IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SUBJECT YET THE MANNER OF THE BREAK WAS SO TRAGIC THAT IT SHOULD BE DETAILED WILLIAM M TWEED HAD GONE ON BUYING MEN AND LEGISLATURES AND ENRICHING HIMSELF
AND DIED IN WASHINGTON D C DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HE BECAME A CLERK IN A BOOK STORE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN AND WITH MONEY THUS ACCUMULATED WAS ENABLED TO ATTEND KENYON COLLEGE
HE WORKED FOR A TIME IN A FURNITURE ESTABLISHMENT BUT THIS KIND OF EMPLOYMENT DID NOT SATISFY HIS ACTIVE NATURE AND HE WENT TO CHICAGO WHERE HIS ENTERPRISE COULD HAVE SEA ROOM
BRANCHES WERE STARTED AT DETROIT SAINT LOUIS PHILADELPHIA AND VARIOUS PLACES IN EUROPE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS OF NECESSITY
NO PROPERTY IS SOLD BUT IF A PARTY DESIRES TO LIVE THERE HE APPLIES TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND A LEASE IS GIVEN WHICH CAN BE CANCELLED BY EITHER PARTY AT TEN DAYS NOTICE NOTHING BUT LIQUOR IS FORBIDDEN
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE HE MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF PETER KORTRIGHT A LADY OF REFINEMENT AND CULTURE HE
SOME PERSONS SUPPOSED THAT MISTER TILDEN WAS A POOR SPEAKER BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE PEOPLE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH MUCH FORCE BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FOR CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT
BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR CHANCES IN YOUTH ARE EQUAL TO THEIRS TAKE COURAGE WORK
WE REGARD HIM AS THE MYSTERIOUS STATESMAN OF AMERICAN HISTORY HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER WAS TO A GREAT EXTENT SHROUDED FROM THE PUBLIC IN A VEIL OF MYSTERY WHICH HAD BOTH ITS VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ELEMENTS
AND THAT ON THE FOURTH DAY OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WOULD COME TO WASHINGTON TO BE INAUGURATED HAD THAT BEEN DONE
THE LIGHTNING OF HIS POWER THE NATION OWES AS MUCH TO HIM AS TO ANY ONE WHO IN COUNCIL OR IN FIELD CONTRIBUTED TO ITS SALVATION AND HIS REAL GREATNESS WAS NEVER MORE CONSPICUOUS
WHERE HE WAS ORIGINALLY BURIED BUT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY HE WAS REMOVED TO RICHMOND WITH GREAT POMP AND RE INTERRED IN HOLLEYWOOD CEMETERY
YET AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN HE PRESUMED TO ASPIRE TO BECOME A LAWYER HE HAD TWO MORE YEARS TO SERVE IN HIS APPRENTICESHIP BUT WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
TO WHOSE CONVERSATION THE PRECOCIOUS CHILD ENJOYED TO LISTEN MISTER TILDEN DECLARED OF HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NO YOUTH AS A BOY HE WAS DIFFIDENT AND WAS STUDYING AND INVESTIGATING WHEN OTHERS WERE PLAYING AND ENJOYING THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY
AT FOURTEEN HE WAS BOUND OUT TO LEARN THE FULLER'S TRADE THINK OF IT BOYS WHAT SPLENDID OPPORTUNITIES MOST OF YOU HAVE YES ALL OF YOU HAVE COMPARED TO THAT OF FILLMORE
WHY HE WOULD NOT DO SO IS STILL IN EXISTENCE OF THIS WE KNOW NOTHING BUT THAT HE HAD REASONS AND ASSIGNED THEM IS CERTAIN WHY HE CONSENTED TO THE METHOD OF ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF HIS CAREER TAKING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES INTO ACCOUNT
HIS CABINET WAS COMPOSED OF SOME OF THE ABLEST MEN IN THE COUNTRY IN EITHER PARTY SOON AFTER HIS INAUGURATION PRESIDENT MONROE MADE A TOUR THROUGH THE EASTERN AND MIDDLE STATES
BUT A SITE IN THAT CITY WOULD BE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE IF INDEED ONE COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND SUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSE ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MILES FROM CHICAGO WAS A SWAMP IT WAS CONSIDERED WORTHLESS
ON MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MONROE RETIRED FROM OFFICE AND RETURNED TO HIS RESIDENCE AT OAK HILL IN VIRGINIA HE WAS CHOSEN A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
ON THAT OCCASION MISTER TWEED WHO WAS EITHER INTOXICATED WITH LIQUOR OR INTOXICATED WITH PRIDE AND VANITY GROSSLY INSULTED MISTER TILDEN
TO SAY THAT HIS HOPES WERE FULLY REALIZED WOULD BE INADEQUATE SO POPULAR DID THEY BECOME THAT HIS SHOPS AT CHICAGO COULD NOT BEGIN TO FILL THE DEMANDS MADE UPON IT FOR HIS PARLOR DINING AND SLEEPING CARS
AND FEEL A PLEASURE IN THE WORK INDEED AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS ASSURES US THAT HIS EYE WOULD GLEAM WITH DELIGHT WHEN A TASK WAS SET BEFORE HIM FROM WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PAY LARGE SUMS TO BE RELIEVED HENCE HIS ABILITIES WERE OF A KIND THAT MADE HIM A MOST DANGEROUS OPPONENT
AND FOR AN EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF SPEECH HE HAD FEW SUPERIORS HIS LANGUAGE WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND WAS INTENT UPON SAYING IT HE WAS AT NO TIME A TRICKY ORATOR NOR DID HE AIM AT ROUSING THE FEELINGS
BUT TOLD ME TO COME THE NEXT MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK HE WENT AND ON HIS RETURN REPORTED WHEN THE QUESTION WHAT DID MISTER TILDEN SAY WAS ASKED HE SAID TO ME YOUR NAME IS YOU ARE FROM IN PENNSYLVANIA
IF NONE OF THE WATCHERS BROKE THE IMPASSE HIS GREATER WEIGHT AND STRENGTH COUNTED NOW THE DISAN WOULD HAVE TO DROP THE KNIFE BEFORE HIS ARM WAS DISLOCATED AT THE SHOULDER HE DIDN'T DO IT WITH SUDDEN HORROR
I DON'T UNDERSTAND BRION SAID A SIMPLE MATTER OF DEFINITION BEFORE YOU CAME WE HAD NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THE MAGTER HERE ON DIS THEY REALLY WERE ALIEN TO US NOTHING THEY DID MADE SENSE
NO FLICKER OF RESPONSE STIRRED IN THE MEN BEFORE HIM THE NYJORDERS KNOW YOU HAVE THE COBALT BOMBS AND THEY HAVE DETECTED YOUR JUMP SPACE PROJECTOR THEY CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE CHANCES
ALL I HEAR IS STATIC IT'S THE OLD PROBLEM OF GENESIS LIKE NEWTON AND THE FALLING APPLE LEVY AND THE HYSTERESIS IN THE WARP FIELD EVERYTHING HAS A BEGINNING IF WE CAN FIND OUT
BETWEEN THE TIME HE LIFTED ONE FOOT AND WALKED A STEP HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE HAD TO FACE THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT NOT TO AN EMPATHETIC FROM THE GROUP OF SILENT MEN POURED A FROST WHITE WAVE OF UNEMOTION
THE WARMTH OF THEIR INTENSE RELIEF AND HAPPINESS IT WAS A SENSATION HE WOULD NEVER FORGET
BUT HE FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR I COULDN'T IGNORE HIS REPORT OF RADIOACTIVE TRACES YOUR GIRL FRIEND ARRIVED WITH THE HACKED UP CORPSE AT THE SAME TIME I DID AND WE ALL TOOK A LONG LOOK AT THE GREEN LEECH IN ITS SKULL
OR YOU ARE SUDDENLY UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD OF LESS THAN FOUR SYLLABLES YOU KNOW WHENEVER THIS HAPPENS WITH YOU I GET THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO COVER UP SOMETHING FOR OCCAM'S SAKE BE SPECIFIC
THE TWENTIES ARE SUCH A BIG THING AT HOME THAT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANYTHING ELSE EXISTS WHILE YOU ARE STILL TAKING PART IN THEM SPARE ME THE TWENTIES SHE PLEADED
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION
I KNOW WHAT THOSE DARTS CAN DO HE PULLED A MICROPHONE FROM ONE OF HIS POCKETS AND SPOKE INTO IT MORE SOLDIERS CROWDED INTO THE CAVE AND PROFESSOR COMMANDER KRAFFT CAME IN BEHIND THEM
I'VE BEEN HANDING OUT TRANQUILIZERS LIKE ASPIRIN ALL DAY THEY'RE FALLING APART THE WORLD'S FALLING APART HOW IS LEA DOING CONSIDERING HER SHAPE SHE'S FINE GO IN AND SEE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
EVERYTHING LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE RUBBED SOME OF THE TENSION FROM HIS EYES LEA'S FACE WAS IRONED SMOOTH BY THE LIGHT BEAUTIFUL AND YOUNG A DIRECT CONTRAST TO EVERYTHING ELSE ON THIS POISONOUS WORLD
A GIRL HAS TO KEEP HER SPIKE HEELS FILED SHARP SHE HAS TO WHAT A FIGURE OF SPEECH BRION MEANING YOU FIGHT BACK ALL THE TIME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WASHED UNDER BY THE FLOOD SOUNDS RATHER
JUST PLAYING THE GAME IN GOOD OLD ANVHARIAN STYLE WAITING FOR A SIGN FROM ME WE'D STILL BE PLAYING BY DIFFERENT RULES IF YOU HADN'T HAD MORE SENSE THAN I
WHY DID YOU LIE TO HER ABOUT THE FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET ISN'T THAT REASON ENOUGH IHJEL RUMBLED ANGRILY SCRAPING THE LAST DREGS FROM THE BOWL BETTER EAT SOMETHING BUILD UP THE STRENGTH
IT WAS A TRUNCATED CONE SINCE THERE WAS NO CEILING A HOT BLUE DISK OF SKY CAST LIGHT ON THE FLOOR BELOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO THE ADAPTATION POSSIBILITIES OF HOMO SAPIENS INDIVIDUALS DIED USUALLY IN ENORMOUS PAIN BUT THE RACE LIVED CHANGED A GOOD DEAL BUT STILL HUMAN
MOST OF THE WATER IS UNDERGROUND AND NORMALLY INACCESSIBLE THE SURFACE WATER IS ALL IN THE FORM OF BRINY CHEMICALLY SATURATED SWAMPS UNDRINKABLE WITHOUT EXTENSIVE PROCESSING
THERE WAS STILL NO ONE IN SIGHT THE ROOM INSIDE WAS SOMETHING OUT OF A MADMAN'S FUNHOUSE IT WAS HIGHER THAN IT WAS WIDE IRREGULAR IN SHAPE
DEATH AND THE RENDING OF FLESH WITH THE SAME LACK OF INTEREST AND COMPASSION
SO AT MIDNIGHT WE DROPPED A FEW LARGE CHEMICAL EXPLOSIVE BOMBS AT THE ENTRANCE ENOUGH TO KILL THE GUARDS WITHOUT BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN
SHE MUST SURELY HAVE TO STAY HOME A LOT ONLY IF SHE WANTS TO OTHERWISE SHE CAN GO WHEREVER SHE WISHES AND BE WELCOMED AS ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL I SUPPOSE IT IS OUT OF FASHION IN THE REST OF THE GALAXY
THAT OR COMPLETE PROMISCUITY ON ANVHAR THE EMPHASIS IS ON PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT SEEMS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM IF WE DIDN'T HAVE AN ADULT WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS OUR KIND OF LIFE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
THE SAME DAMN WAY THEY GET MADE ANY PLACE ELSE BUT IT'S NOT JUST A REFLEXIVE PROCESS LIKE A COUPLE OF RABBITS THAT HAPPEN TO MEET UNDER THE SAME BUSH
IT WAS A GOOD GRIP AND HE COULD HOLD THE ARM IMMOBILIZED THEY HAD REACHED STASIS STANDING KNEE TO KNEE THEIR FACES ONLY A FEW INCHES APART
I NEVER DID BRION SAID TO THE RETREATING BACK LEA'S ROOM WAS DARK ILLUMINATED ONLY BY THE LIGHT OF DIS'S MOON SLANTING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW
REMOVING THE MENACE TO NYJORD FOR ALL TIME MEDVIRK ULV HAD SAID A LIFE FORM THAT COOPERATES AND AIDS OTHER LIFE FORMS IT MAY KILL IN SELF DEFENSE BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY NOT A KILLER OR DESTROYER
JERKED THROUGH THE DISAN'S BODY AND THE ARM HUNG LIMP AND DEAD NO EXPRESSION CROSSED THE MAN'S FACE THE KNIFE WAS STILL LOCKED IN THE FINGERS OF THE PARALYZED HAND
BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE HIS ARMS WERE AROUND HER HOLDING HER TO HIM
THESE ARE THE PROGRESS REPORTS YOU ASKED FOR FROM ALL UNITS DETAILS TO DATE CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTIONS ET CETERA
THEIR BODY TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES THEY HAVE SPECIALIZED TISSUE IN THE GLUTEAL AREA FOR STORING WATER THESE ARE MINOR CHANGES COMPARED TO THE MAJOR ONES THEY HAVE DONE IN FITTING THEMSELVES FOR THIS PLANET
ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS WAS RUNNING AND SCREAMING THE MAGTER KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND BEAT HIM INTO SILENCE SEEING THIS THE OTHER TWO MEN RETURNED TO WORK WITH SHAKING HANDS EVEN IF ALL LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET WAS DEAD
I DID A LOT OF SKIING AND USED TO WORK FOR THE TWENTIES SOMETIMES I WOULD GO VISITING THEN AGAIN PEOPLE WOULD DROP IN ON ME HOUSES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN ON ANVHAR WE DON'T EVEN HAVE LOCKS ON OUR DOORS
BRION DIDN'T LIKE THE TINY SOUND HIS VOICE MADE IN THE IMMENSE ROOM ONE OF THE MEN GAVE A SLIGHT MOTION TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF NONE OF THE OTHERS MOVED THEY STILL WAITED
HE IS LIKE A MAN GLANCING ACROSS THE OPEN PAGES OF A TABLEFUL OF BOOKS HE CAN SEE THAT THE TYPE WORDS PARAGRAPHS THOUGHTS ARE THERE EVEN WITHOUT FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
HE LOOKED STRANGELY OUT OF KEEPING IN THE DUSTY COMBAT UNIFORM THE GUN WAS EVEN MORE INCONGRUOUS IN HIS BLUE VEINED HAND AFTER GIVING THE PISTOL TO THE NEAREST SOLDIER WITH AN AIR OF RELIEF
AT THE UNIVERSITIES I SUPPOSE THOUGH I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR SURE AND YOU MUST REALIZE THAT WHEN I SAY NO BIG CITIES I ALSO MEAN NO LITTLE CITIES WE AREN'T ORGANIZED THAT WAY AT ALL
HE WAS OBSESSED BY THE STRANGE FEELING THAT NONE OF THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU AS THE MAN WHO SAVED US FROM OURSELVES KRAFFT SAID ONCE AGAIN THE PROFESSOR INSTEAD OF THE COMMANDER
NOT MECHANICAL THEY WEREN'T EVEN USING THE WHEEL WHEN THEY WERE REDISCOVERED THEY BECAME SORT OF CULTURAL SPECIALISTS DIGGING DEEP INTO THE PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF INTERRELATIONSHIP
THEY HAVE VITALITY WITHOUT NEEDING DESTRUCTION BUT IF THEY ARE FORCED TO BLOW UP DIS FOR THEIR OWN SURVIVAL AGAINST EVERY ONE OF THEIR BASIC TENETS THEIR PHILOSOPHY WON'T ENDURE
INDIVIDUALS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN AND WITH THIS PROXIMITY MUST BE SOME CERTAINTY OF RELATIONS YOU'RE LOSING ME LEA PROTESTED EITHER I'M STILL FOGGY FROM THE DOPE
SOMETHING SHE HAD BEEN WANTING TO DO FOR A LONG TIME I HAD TO HE SAID TRYING TO IGNORE THE LIGHT TOUCH OF HER FINGERS BECAUSE I THOUGHT SO MUCH OF YOU I COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO INSULT YOU
RIGHT AND WRONG WERE FORGOTTEN THEY HAD BEEN KILLED THE INVISIBLE DEATH OF RADIATION MUST ALREADY BE PENETRATING INTO THE CAVES BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE CHANCE FOR VENGEANCE SWIFTLY THEY BROUGHT THEIR WORK TO COMPLETION
IT WAS THE MAN'S POSE THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE TENSED TO LEAP HIS LIPS DRAWN BACK TO SHOW ALL OF THIS TEETH HE LOOKS AS IF HE WANTED TO KILL THE PHOTOGRAPHER SHE SAID HE ALMOST DID JUST AFTER THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN
SOMEONE WAS EITHER BEING VERY FUNNY OR VERY EFFICIENT EITHER WAY IT WAS COLD
THE SILENCE GREW LONGER BRION HAD NO INTENTION OF MAKING THIS A MONOLOGUE HE NEEDED FACTS TO OPERATE TO FORM AN OPINION LOOKING AT THE SILENT FORMS WAS TELLING HIM NOTHING TIME STRETCHED TAUT
HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
FOR EITHER SPAWN OR NOSTOC GREG'S COMMENT IN THIS INSTANCE IS CURIOUS IF TRUE BUT HE RECORDS WITHOUT MODIFICATION THE FALL OF A METEORITE AT GOTHA GERMANY SEPTEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
AT NIGHT OCTOBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR NEAR COBLENZ A GERMAN WHO WAS KNOWN TO GREG AND ANOTHER PERSON SAW A LUMINOUS BODY FALL CLOSE TO THEM THEY RETURNED NEXT MORNING AND FOUND A GELATINOUS MASS
TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
THAT THE FALL DID TAKE PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARE STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY CONSERVATORS IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA
IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
I SUPPOSE IN ALASKA AND IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS ALL THE MEDICINE MEN WERE SIMILARLY UPON TRIAL SOMETHING HAD TO BE THOUGHT OF UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA OF THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
HIS FEELING WAS OF CONVICTION THAT PROPRIETY HAD BEEN RE ESTABLISHED OR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED AS HE EXPRESSES IT KNOWING MISTER BRANDEIS WELL HE HAD CALLED UPON THAT UPHOLDER OF RESPECTABILITY
A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
THAT SEEMED TO PASS NEAR THE GROUND
THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
LAVOISIER'S ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY PROVED
IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF CONSIDERED THE CURE AS COMPLETE OUR FIRST CASE DEALT WITH HYPNOSIS OUR SECOND CASE REMOVED THE INTRUDING IDEA BY A PERCEPTION IN A WAKING STATE
THAT THE CURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REACHED SO QUICKLY POSSIBLY NOT AT ALL IF THE SECOND SUGGESTION THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IMAGE HAD BEEN GIVEN AT THE FIRST STEP THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SECURED
WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE INJURIES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POWERFUL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH THE BEST MEANING MINISTER BUT WE CAN EXTEND THIS FEAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED MEDICINE AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
AND ESPECIALLY THE MEALS THEMSELVES FORCED THE VISUAL IMAGE INTO THE CENTRE AND CAPTURED THE ATTENTION TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT A CONFUSING DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL SURROUNDINGS RESULTED
SHE ASSURED ME THAT SHE FELT IT EVERY TIME MORE DRAMATICALLY THE POWER OF THE OBSESSION WEAKENED FROM THE FIRST DAY AFTER THE FOURTH TIME IT HAD DISAPPEARED
WITH VIVIDNESS ANY LONGER FROM THE THIRD DAY IT HAD DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY I TOLD HIM TO GO ON WITH THE PROCESS STILL EVERY MORNING FOR SOME WEEKS
THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
THE PATIENT IS A HIGHLY EDUCATED PHYSICIAN OF MIDDLE AGE HE REPORTS THAT HE HAD BEEN NEURASTHENIC ALL HIS LIFE WITH SLIGHT EVER CHANGING SYMPTOMS
IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
HE CAME TO ME WITH THE DIRECT REQUEST AS A LAST RESORT TO TRY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT I FOUND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS PHYSICIAN HAD CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS
AGAIN I SUGGESTED ONLY THE OPPOSITE ATTITUDE THE POSITIVE TURNING TO THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE COMPLETE NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE FOR THE POSSIBLE MEMORY IMAGE THIS TIME THE EFFECT WAS STILL STRONGER
THAT SUCH CASES ARE EVERYWHERE ABOUT THEM AS A MATTER OF COURSE I ALSO LEAVE OUT EVERYTHING WHICH REFERS TO INSANITY
HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TROUBLED BY THE PERSEVERATION OF TACTUAL IMAGES WHICH HAD A STRONG FEELING TONE AND WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SEEN OR HEARD REPORTS
IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
THIS THOUGHT KEEPS HER AWAY FROM COMPANY AND THE EFFECT OF ITS EMBARRASSING OCCURRENCE DEPRESSES HER BUT SHE IS SURE THAT THE THOUGHT ITSELF DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY EMOTION IT IS A MERE THINKING OF IT
THAT HE WAS NOW FULLY HYPNOTIZED TO WHAT DEGREE HE REALLY WAS HYPNOTIZED CANNOT BE SAID AS NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO TEST IT BY ANY EXPERIMENTS
WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE TROUBLESOME THE PATIENT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST FEAR OF MENTAL DISEASE AND NO ANXIETY BUT HE FELT A VERY SERIOUS DISTURBANCE BY THE INSTINCTIVE EFFORT TO GET RID OF THE INTRUSION
BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY YOU STAND CONVICTED OF APPLYING A PROCESS WHICH DEPRIVES YOUR SUBJECTS OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT AND POWER OF INDIVIDUAL SELF CONTROL IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE POWER OF SELF CONTROL
AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
THE HYPNOTIST IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MYSTIC POWER TO BRING ANY PERSON IN A DISTANT REGION UNDER HIS MENTAL CONTROL AND THUS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY SINISTER PLANS BY THE HELP OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIM ALL HYPNOTIZING THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE INTERDICTED BY THE STATE
NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
THE IDEA OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SEEING HIS FRIEND PARTAKING OF THE DINNER AND IMAGINING HER DRINKING THE POISON GAVE HIM A STRONG SHOCK THERE WAS HARDLY ANY GRIEF MIXED IN
BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
FOR A DEEP PHYSIOLOGICAL BRAIN EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD IRRADIATED TOWARDS THE IDEAS OF HER PERSONALITY IT HAD STIRRED UP THERE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH KEPT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTER
IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
BUT SIMPLY A STRONG TACTUAL SENSATION AS IF THE SKIN OF THE WRIST WAS SCRATCHED AND PINCHED FINALLY AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE ASSOCIATION CHARACTER
AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
MIGHT BE REENFORCED BY DIRECT PERCEPTION THE ABNORMAL TACTUAL SENSATION FORCED ON CONSCIOUSNESS THE IDEA
THERE WAS ANOTHER TEACHER AFTERWARD AT KNOB CREEK A MAN NAMED CALEB HAZEL LITTLE IS KNOWN OF EITHER OF THESE TEACHERS EXCEPT THAT HE TAUGHT LITTLE ABE LINCOLN IF THEIR PUPIL HAD NOT BECOME FAMOUS
FOR THEY MADE HIM SHERIFF O THE COUNTY HE WAS SECH A GOOD SHOT TOO AN THEY LECTED HIM TO THE LEGISLATUR AFTER KENTUCKY COME IN AS A STATE HE STOOD HIGH IN THE COUNTY FOLKS DIDN'T MIND HIS SHOOTIN AN INJUN OR TWO MORE OR LESS
WHEN MISTER BROOKS ASKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH FOR THAT OCCASION MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN BUT NOT LICKED INTO SHAPE YET IT'S SHORT SHORT SHORT
SO THAT IN GETTING BAKER THE NOMINATION I SHALL BE FIXED LIKE A FELLOW WHO IS MADE A GROOMSMAN TO A FELLOW THAT HAS CUT HIM OUT AND IS MARRYING HIS OWN DEAR GAL MISTER LINCOLN ABOUT THIS TIME WAS OFFERED THE NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS
CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
MEANWHILE HE WAS INTERESTING HIMSELF IN BEHALF OF YOUNG WILLIAM H HERNDON WHO AFTER SPEED'S REMOVAL TO KENTUCKY
THE STRONGHOLD OF THE GREAT WEST
THE BEST THING OF ALL WAS THE READING OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS DURING THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS AFTER THE WOOD WAS BROUGHT IN AND FATHER TOM HAD SET HIS TRAPS AND DONE HIS OTHER WORK FOR THE NIGHT NANCY'S VOICE WAS LOW
SOME ONE COULD EASILY HAVE SHOT YOU WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING THERE AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE THREATENING YOUR LIFE THE PRESIDENT SMILED AT HIS WIFE THROUGH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE PAIN AND SADNESS AND SHRUGGED HIS GREAT SHOULDERS
AN MORD FETCHES HIM DOWN LIKE HE DID THE FELLOW THAT WAS GOIN TO SKELP FATHER THAT MADE THE OTHERS MAD AN THEY TOOK AFTER ME BUT MORD HE DROPS THE HEAD ONE JIST WHEN HE'S GOIN TO HIT ME BUT ALL I KNOWED AT THE TIME WAS THAT THEM RED DEVILS WAS A CHASIN ME
WHICH WERE GREAT EVENTS BECAUSE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IN THOSE PRIMITIVE DAYS ABE USED AFTERWARD TO GET HIS PLAYMATES TOGETHER AND PREACH TO THEM IN A WAY THAT SOMETIMES FRIGHTENED THEM AND MADE THEM CRY
FOR I SAW THOMAS LINCOLN MARRY NANCY HANKS ON THE TWELFTH DAY OF JUNE EIGHTEEN O SIX I WAS HUNTING ROOTS FOR MY MEDICINE AND JUST WENT TO THE WEDDING TO GET A GOOD SUPPER AND GOT IT TOM LINCOLN WAS A CARPENTER
AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
MY CHILDHOOD'S HOME I SEE AGAIN AND SADDEN WITH THE VIEW AND STILL AS MEMORY CROWDS THE BRAIN THERE'S PLEASURE IN IT TOO AH MEMORY THOU MIDWAY WORLD TWIXT EARTH AND PARADISE
BUT MISTER EVERETT WAS TO BE THE CHIEF SPEAKER OF THE OCCASION THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE DATE OF THE DEDICATION THE PRESIDENT WENT WITH HIS FRIEND NOAH BROOKS
THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
YOUNG MAN SEEMED TO BE MADE OF THE RIGHT KIND OF METAL WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND AGREEABLE AND MISTER LINCOLN LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN HE COULD HAVE BILLY WITH HIM IN A BUSINESS OF HIS OWN MISSUS LINCOLN WITH THAT MARVELOUS INSTINCT WHICH WOMEN OFTEN POSSESS
LIVED NEAR THE LINCOLNS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE AND GAVE MISSUS ELEANOR ATKINSON THIS DESCRIPTION OF THEIR EARLY LIFE TOGETHER LOOKS DIDN'T COUNT THEM DAYS NOHOW IT WAS STREN'TH AN WORK AN DAREDEVIL
THE MEN AND THEIR SCHOOLS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN HISTORY AN OLD MAN NAMED AUSTIN GOLLAHER USED TO LIKE TO TELL OF THE DAYS WHEN HE AND LITTLE ABE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER HE SAID
TILL ONE DAY WHEN HE AND MY BROTHERS MORDECAI
BUT HE WAS NEVER A PAUPER HIS HARDSHIPS WERE THOSE OF MANY OTHER PIONEERS THE WEALTHIEST OF WHOM SUFFERED GREATER PRIVATIONS THAN THE POOREST LABORING MAN HAS TO ENDURE TO DAY AFTER HIS NOMINATION TO THE PRESIDENCY
THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
FOR HE MOVED WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND HIS BABY GIRL TO A FARM ON NOLEN CREEK FOURTEEN MILES AWAY THE CHIEF ATTRACTION OF THE SO CALLED FARM WAS A FINE SPRING OF WATER BUBBLING UP IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL GROVE
YES MY FATHER REPLIED THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT AND I'M GLAD IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT THE MEMBERS OF THE BAR HERE GRUMBLE BECAUSE YOU CHARGE TOO LITTLE FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND I'M WILLING TO DO MY SHARE TOWARD EDUCATING YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WELL
GAVE THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE MARRIAGE FEAST OF THE LINCOLN BRIDE AND GROOM I AM ONE OF THE TWO LIVING MEN WHO CAN PROVE THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN OR LINKHORN AS THE FAMILY WAS MISCALLED WAS BORN IN LAWFUL WEDLOCK
TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
WAS IN BUSINESS FACING THE SQUARE NOT FAR FROM THE COURT HOUSE HE HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH A MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE DOING A GOOD STRAIGHT BUSINESS FOR YEARS BUT THE FELLOW DISAPPEARED ONE NIGHT OWING FATHER ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TIME WENT ON AND FATHER GOT NO TRACE OF THE VANISHED DEBTOR
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
LET ME READ YOU A CHAPTER THAT IS VERY FUNNY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET SMILED AS FOR MYSELF I WAS ANGRY AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BUFFOONERY
GRANDFATHER LINCOLN HAD BUILT A SOLID LOG CABIN AND CLEARED A FIELD OR TWO AROUND IT NEAR THE FALLS OF THE OHIO ABOUT WHERE LOUISVILLE NOW STANDS BUT IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE TRAGIC DAY DAWNED UPON THE LINCOLNS
THEN I HEARD THE CRACK OF A RIFLE AND I SAW A PUFF OF SMOKE FLOATIN OUT O THE BUSHES INJUNS GASPS MORD AND STARTS ON THE RUN FOR THE HOUSE TO GET HIS GUN JOSIAH HE STARTS RIGHT OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE BEARGRASS FORT
CHAPTER TWO ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S FATHER AND MOTHER WHILE THOMAS LINCOLN WAS LIVING WITH A FARMER AND DOING ODD JOBS OF CARPENTERING HE MET NANCY HANKS A TALL SLENDER WOMAN WITH DARK SKIN DARK BROWN HAIR
THAT DECLARATION YOUNG ABE LINCOLN FIRST READ IN THE GENTRYVILLE CONSTABLE'S COPY OF THE STATUTES OF INDIANA AT NOON ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
ONE OF HIS SPEECHES WAS DELIVERED FROM THE DOOR OF A HARNESS SHOP NEAR GENTRYVILLE AND ONE HE MADE IN THE OLD CARTER SCHOOLHOUSE AFTER THIS ADDRESS HE DROVE HOME WITH MISTER JOSIAH CRAWFORD OLD BLUE NOSE
WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCET THEY ALL LOOKED ON REDSKINS LIKE THEY WAS CATAMOUNTS AN OTHER PESKY VARMINTS YOUR GRANDMOTHER LINCOLN AN JOSIAH AN ME MOVED OVER INTO WASHINGTON COUNTY
CHAPTER FIFTEEN LINCOLN AND HERNDON YOUNG HERNDON'S STRANGE FASCINATION FOR LINCOLN LINCOLN REMAINED IN THE OFFICE WITH JUDGE LOGAN ABOUT FOUR YEARS DISSOLVING PARTNERSHIP IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
BUT THE NEXT YEAR WE HAD NO SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE WERE SO FEW SCHOLARS TO ATTEND THERE BEING ONLY ABOUT TWENTY IN THE SCHOOL THE YEAR BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY ABE AND I HAD NOT MUCH TO DO BUT AS WE DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL AND OUR MOTHERS WERE STRICT WITH US
DRESSED IN THEIR STATE COSTUMES AFTER AN INTERCHANGE OF CIVILITIES AND PRESENTS THE ENGLISH RECEIVED SOME RICE SUGAR CANES FOWLS FIGO
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THOSE GASCONS WHO FORMED THE BASIS OF THE ARMIES OF HENRY OF NAVARRE AND IN SUCH SOCIETY HE PERFECTED THE HABITS OF BOASTING AND FALSEHOOD WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CHARACTER
REACHING TO THE GROUND HE WORE AS AN ORNAMENT UPON THE HEAD A KIND OF TURBAN MADE OF THE SAME STUFF ALL WORKED IN FINE GOLD AND ENRICHED WITH JEWELS AND TUFTS ON HIS NECK THERE HUNG A FINE GOLD CHAIN MANY TIMES DOUBLED
THIS WAS THE LAST TOWN IN THE PROVINCE OF MANGI THAT RESISTED THE DOMINION OF KUBLAI KHAN HE BESIEGED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND HE OWED HIS TAKING IT AT LAST TO THE HELP OF THE THREE POLOS
EDMUND DRAKE HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THOSE CLERGY WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE HIS POVERTY WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY THE RESPECT WHICH WAS FELT FOR HIS CHARACTER
FRANCIS DRAKE STARTED FROM PLYMOUTH ON THE FIFTEENTH NOVEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE HAD SOME INTERCOURSE WITH THE MOORS OF MOGADOR OF WHICH HE HAD NO REASON TO BOAST
WHEN MARCO POLO HAD BEEN AT CAMBALUC SOME TIME HE WAS SENT ON A MISSION THAT KEPT HIM ABSENT FROM THE CAPITAL FOR FOUR MONTHS TEN MILES SOUTHWARDS FROM CAMBALUC HE CROSSED THE FINE RIVER PE HO NOR
AFTER AN ABSENCE OF THREE YEARS ALL BUT A FEW DAYS THE RECEPTION WHICH AWAITED HIM IN ENGLAND WAS AT FIRST EXTREMELY COLD HIS HAVING FALLEN BY SURPRISE BOTH UPON SPANISH TOWNS AND SHIPS
AND AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE WELL INSTRUCTED IN THE ART OF MAKING WAR FOR THEY KEPT GOOD ORDER IN MARCHING AND ADVANCING AND FOR SO FEW MEN AS THEY WERE THEY MADE THEMSELVES APPEAR A LARGE NUMBER
IT IS A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND THAT HE FALLS INTO DISGRACE WITH HIS ROYAL MISTRESS
THERE IS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY ALL THE PROVINCE OF CATHAY AND SO FERTILE IS THE SOIL THAT ACCORDING TO A FRENCH TRAVELLER
THE PEOPLE WERE FOREWARNED OF HIS APPROACH SO THAT HE FOUND THERE A STRONG FORCE WHICH OBLIGED HIM TO RE EMBARK AT ARICA HE PLUNDERED THREE SMALL VESSELS
BUT WHAT MOST REJOICED THE HEART OF DRAKE WAS TO LEARN THAT A GALLEON NAMED THE CAGAFUEGO VERY RICHLY LADEN WAS SAILING TOWARDS PARACA HE IMMEDIATELY WENT IN PURSUIT
THE DUTCHMEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR PILOT TOSS AT RANDOM UPON THE OCEAN
IF DRAKE WERE ACCUSED UPON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND IN SPITE OF THE MODERATION WHICH HE ALWAYS EVINCED TOWARDS HIS MEN OF HAVING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF A RIVAL WHOM HE DREADED
AND WHO HAD TAUGHT HIS COUNTRYMEN THE WAY TO THE INDIES IT BEHOVES US WHILE EXTOLLING HIS QUALITIES AS A SAILOR
ON LEAVING TOLOMAN HE FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A RIVER FOR TWELVE DAYS AND FOUND NUMEROUS TOWNS ON ITS BANKS
AND JOHN DE BREMEN THE CAPTAIN PETER ESIAS BEING THE ONLY MAN WHO ESCAPED IT WAS A SORROWFUL COMMENCEMENT FOR A CAMPAIGN A SAD PRESAGE WHICH WAS DESTINED NOT TO REMAIN UNFULFILLED DE NOORT WHO WAS FURIOUS OVER THIS FOUL PLAY
WHO CONSTRUCTED SOME POWERFUL BALISTAS AND CRUSHED THE BESIEGED UNDER A PERFECT HAIL STORM OF STONES SOME OF WHICH WEIGHED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS FROM SAIANFU
AND THE DESCRIPTION HERE GIVEN BY DRAKE OF THE SAVAGES WHOM HE MET DOES NOT AT ALL RESEMBLE THAT GIVEN BY PIGAFETTA OF THE PATAGONIANS OF PORT SAINT JULIAN IF THERE EXIST AS SEEMS NOW TO BE PROVED A RACE OF MEN OF GREAT STATURE
THE CAPITAL OF THE PROVINCE OF SE CHUEN WHENCE HE HAD STARTED ON HIS EXCURSION INTO THIBET AND RETRACING THE ROUTE BY WHICH HE HAD SET OUT HE RETURNED TO KUBLAI KHAN
OF WHAT WAS DESTINED TO TAKE PLACE IN MEXICO THEN THEY BESIEGED LA MINA WHERE SOME MORE NEGROES WERE TAKEN WHICH THEY SOLD AT THE ANTILLES HAWKINS DOUBTLESS BY THE ADVICE OF DRAKE CAPTURED THE TOWN OF RIO DE LA HACHA
IN THIS CITY DWELL THE RICHEST MERCHANTS IN THE WORLD WITH THEIR WIVES WHO ARE BEAUTIFUL AND ANGELIC CREATURES IT IS THE RESIDENCE OF A VICEROY
BUFFALOES AND OXEN THE RICH SEASONING THEIR RAW MEAT WITH GARLIC SAUCE AND GOOD SPICES THIS COUNTRY IS INFESTED WITH GREAT ADDERS AND SERPENTS HIDEOUS TO LOOK UPON
WHEN WE ARRIVED THE SAVAGES MANIFESTED GREAT ADMIRATION AT THE SIGHT OF US AND THINKING THAT WE WERE GODS THEY RECEIVED US WITH GREAT HUMANITY AND REVERENCE AS LONG AS WE REMAINED THEY CONTINUED TO COME AND VISIT US
WHERE A LARGE TRADE IN SANDAL WOOD IS CARRIED ON AT TEN DAYS JOURNEY FROM HENCE HE CAME TO THE MODERN TOWN OF TAI YEN FOU WHICH WAS ONCE THE SEAT OF AN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT
SOME OF THE PATAGONIANS WHO WERE SEEN ON THE THIRTEENTH MAY A LITTLE BELOW SEAL BAY SAYS THE ORIGINAL NARRATIVE WORE ON THE HEAD A KIND OF HORN AND NEARLY ALL HAD MANY BEAUTIFUL BIRDS FEATHERS BY WAY OF HATS
THE TRAVELLER IS LEAVING THE COUNTRY KNOWN AS INDIA BEYOND THE GANGES AND RETURNING TOWARDS CHINA IN FACT MARCO POLO AFTER LEAVING TOLOMAN
AND BY THAT MEANS MAY INCREASE THE INFLUENCE AND PROSPERITY OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY ALL THE MORE THOUGHTFUL MINDS IN ENGLAND WHO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF PUBLIC OPINION HAKLUYT THOMAS HARIOT CARLYLE PECKHAM AND THE BROTHERS GILBERT
DAGGERS AND BUCKLERS AND ALL THESE ARMS ARE MADE WITH MUCH ART DRAKE HAD BEEN SOME LITTLE TIME AT JAVA WHEN HE LEARNT THAT NOT FAR DISTANT THERE WAS A POWERFUL FLEET AT ANCHOR WHICH HE SUSPECTED MUST BELONG TO SPAIN
HE AFTERWARDS RAVAGED PLUNDERED OR BURNT THE TOWNS OF PARACA CINCHA PISCA AND PAITA AND DEVASTATED THE ISLAND OF PUNA
THEY ARE SAYS THIS GREAT TRAVELLER ROCKS OF MICACEOUS SLATE AND OF SPARKLING TALC WHICH ARE RESPLENDENT IN THE MIDST OF A SHEET OF WATER WHICH ACTS AS A REFLECTOR BENEATH THE BURNING TROPICAL SUN
AND LATER ON THE DUTCH WERE DESTINED TO INFLICT MUCH INJURY UPON THE SPANIARDS AND THE LARGE PROFITS ACCRUING TO HIM FROM IT ENCOURAGED HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND GAVE BIRTH IN THEIR MINDS TO THE LOVE FOR LONG AND HAZARDOUS VOYAGES
AND ALSO DISCHARGED THEIR CANNON OVER THEM AFTER THIS BLOODY AND FRUITLESS VICTORY DE NOORT WENT TO RECRUIT AT BORNEO CAPTURED A RICH CARGO OF SPICES AT JAVA AND HAVING DOUBLED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE LANDED AT ROTTERDAM ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST
THE FIRST CITY IN THE PROVINCE OF TCHANG SU
AT THIS MOMENT THEREFORE ARISES THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EMIGRATION AS MAY RELIEVE THE COUNTRY OF ITS POPULATION MAY PERMIT ALL THE MISERABLE PEOPLE DYING OF HUNGER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN WANTS IN A NEW COUNTRY
THEIR HABITAT APPEARS FIXED UPON THE SHORES OF THE STRAIT AT THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF PATAGONIA
NEVER SPARING THEIR ENEMIES OF WHOM AFTER THEY HAVE KILLED THEM THEY DRINK THE BLOOD AND EAT THE FLESH AFTER PASSING BY QUENLIFU NOW KIEN NING FOO
AND WHO HAD JUST ADDED PORTUGAL TO HIS POSSESSIONS HAD FORBIDDEN HIS SUBJECTS TO HAVE ANY COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE REBELS OF THE LOW COUNTRIES IT WAS THUS A NECESSITY FOR HOLLAND IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE RUINED
FIVE DAYS JOURNEY WEST OF CARAJAN MARCO POLO TOOK A NEW ROUTE TO THE SOUTH AND ENTERED THE PROVINCE OF ZARDANDAN
KUBLAI KHAN DRAWS IMMENSE REVENUES FROM THIS TOWN AND PROVINCE AND IT IS BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WE MUST RECKON THE INCOME DERIVED FROM THE SUGAR SALT SPICES AND SILK
ONE YEAR AFTER THE RETURN OF THE COMPANIONS OF BARENTZ
PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS WATERS BEING DARKENED BY THE AQUATIC PLANTS GROWING IN THEM AT TWO DAYS JOURNEY FROM HENCE HE CAME TO THE TOWN OF CACIANFU WHOSE POSITION IS NOT NOW CLEARLY DEFINED
WHILE DRAKE HIMSELF HIT BY TWO ARROWS ON THE HEAD
WHICH WAS NOT MORE THAN THREE MILES FROM THE MAINLAND BUT BEFORE PUTTING TO SEA HE WAS OBLIGED TO BURN THE EENDRACHT
IT WAS TWO FEET LONG AND SHARP ON BOTH EDGES WHILE THE IRON WAS HOT HE BEAT INTO IT SOME RUNES WHEN THE MEN IN THE SMITHY SAW THE RUNES THEY OPENED THEIR EYES WIDE AND LOOKED AT THE BOY FOR FEW NORSEMEN COULD READ WHAT DOES IT SAY
OF THE FORMS OF BOATS VIKING TALES A CRUSADE AS A TALE OF TRAVEL AND DISCOVERY MONASTERIES AS CENTERS OF WORK PRINTING
THEY MADE A HOUSE OUT OF STONES FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THAT PLACE THEY LIVED THERE THAT WINTER THE SEA FOR A LONG WAY OUT FROM SHORE FROZE SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHITE LAND THE MEN WENT OUT UPON IT TO HUNT WHITE BEAR AND SEAL
BUT BETTER THEY MAY APPLY NORSE IDEAS OF FORM AND DECORATION AND NORSE PROCESSES
AT FIRST HE ONLY WATCHED THE MEN OR WORKED THE BELLOWS BUT SOON HE COULD HANDLE THE TONGS AND HOLD THE RED HOT IRON AND AFTER A LONG TIME HE LEARNED TO USE THE HAMMER AND TO SHAPE METAL ONE DAY HE MADE HIMSELF A SPEAR HEAD
KING HARALD OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT RICH GIFTS CAPES AND SWORD BELTS AND BEAUTIFUL CLOTH AND BRACELETS AND GOLD CLOAK PINS THESE HE SENT ABOUT THE HALL AND GAVE SOMETHING TO EVERY MAN THE GUESTS WONDERED AT THE RICHNESS OF HIS GIFTS
WHAT ARE YOUR NAME AND COUNTRY I AM LEIF ERICSSON AND I HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM GREENLAND TO SEE YOU AND OLD NORWAY FROM GREENLAND SAID THE KING IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT I SEE A GREENLANDER
THE STUDY WILL HAVE A GENERAL VALUE THAT WILL CONTINUE PAST THE READING OF THESE STORIES INTO ALL WORK IN GEOGRAPHY TRUSTWORTHY PICTURES OF NORSE HOUSES AND COSTUMES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN
ITS NAME IS VALHALLA IT HAS FIVE HUNDRED DOORS THE RAFTERS ARE SPEARS THE ROOF IS THATCHED WITH SHIELDS ARMOR LIES ON THE BENCHES
GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
ONE DAY AS ERIC SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT HE SAID I THINK THAT I SEE ONE OF GUNNBIORN'S SHIPS OF ICE SHALL WE SAIL UP TO HER AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A CRAFT SHE IS YES SHOUTED HIS MEN
METAL WORKING AND WOOD CARVING WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTS OF THE NORSE IF CHILDREN STUDY
TABLES BEFORE A MEAL THRALLS
MATERIALS FOR THIS STUDY ARE NOT DIFFICULT OF ACCESS FOREIGN COLORED PHOTOGRAPHS OF NORWEGIAN LANDSCAPE ARE BECOMING COMMON IN OUR ART STORES THERE ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE
AND ALL NIGHT THEY FEAST AND THEIR WOUNDS HEAL BUT NONE MAY GO TO VALHALLA EXCEPT WARRIORS THAT HAVE DIED BRAVELY IN BATTLE MEN WHO DIE FROM SICKNESS GO WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND COWARDS
THESE TWO POINTS THE ISLAND CONNECTION THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE LONG VOYAGE FROM NORWAY TO AMERICA AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STORM TO DISCOVERY I HAVE STATED IN THE BOOK ONLY DRAMATICALLY
THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT WHO PLANNED THIS COURSE SAYS IT IS IN A SENSE A DRAMATIZATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING IS A BARE TOPICAL OUTLINE OF THE WORK EVOLUTION
HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID
THRALLS BROUGHT A HORN OF MEAD TO EACH MAN THAT WAS CALLED THE STIRRUP HORN
AEGIR THE BIG HANDED THEY CALLED HIM IN MANY A BATTLE HIS SWORD HAD SUNG AND HE HAD SENT MANY WARRIORS TO VALHALLA MANY SWORDS HAD BIT INTO HIS FLESH AND LEFT MARKS THERE BUT NEVER A ONE HAD STRUCK HIM TO DEATH
ACROSS THE EAST END OF THE HALL WAS A BENCH WHEN THE MEN WERE ALL IN THE QUEEN HARALD'S MOTHER AND THE WOMEN WHO LIVED WITH HER
BELTED AT THE WAIST WITH A STRAP HE HAD ON COARSE SHOES AND LEATHER LEGGINGS AROUND HIS NECK WAS AN IRON COLLAR WELDED TOGETHER SO THAT IT COULD NOT COME OFF ON IT WERE STRANGE MARKS CALLED RUNES THAT SAID
THEN THE PEOPLE
SOMETIMES DURING THE FIGHT A MAN WOULD THINK THAT HE SAW THE VALKYRIAS
BUT IF I TAKE MY SPORT LIKE A WOLF I MUST BE HUNTED LIKE ONE
SO THAT DRAGONS SEEMED TO BE CRAWLING ACROSS OR EAGLES SEEMED TO BE SWOOPING DOWN THE GUESTS WALKED IN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH THEIR BIG VOICES SO THAT THE RAFTERS RANG
IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
THEN THEY WENT AND CUT THREE LONG PIECES OF TURF
A NORSE FATHER SENT HIS CHILDREN AWAY FROM HOME TO GROW UP THEY WENT WHEN THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD AND STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE GROWN THE FATHER THOUGHT
PERHAPS THIS RIVER WILL CARRY US TO A WHIRLPOOL AND SUCK US UNDER THE MEN SAID BUT AT LAST ERIC FELT THE CURRENT LESS STRONG UNDER HIS HAND TO THE OARS AGAIN HE CALLED
THE KING GAVE HIM TWO THRALLS AS A PARTING GIFT LET THIS GIFT SHOW MY LOVE LEIF ERICSSON HE SAID FOR YOUR SAKE I SHALL NOT FORGET GREENLAND LEIF SAILED BACK AGAIN AND HAD GOOD LUCK UNTIL HE WAS PAST ICELAND
ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
LINED WITH SEAL FUR HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
MOST OF THE LAND IN OLD NORWAY WAS COVERED WITH FORESTS WHEN A MAN GOT NEW LAND HE HAD TO CLEAR OFF THE TREES IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS A MAN DID NOT HAVE A SURNAME THAT BELONGED TO EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY
AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD
SOMETIMES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE MEN OF THE SAME NAME IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT CAUSED TROUBLE PEOPLE THOUGHT OF TWO WAYS OF MAKING IT EASY TO TELL WHICH MAN WAS BEING SPOKEN OF EACH WAS GIVEN A NICKNAME SUPPOSE
WITH LIGHTNING AROUND THEM WITH BLOODY SHIRTS OF MAIL AND WITH SHINING SPEARS THEY RIDE THROUGH THE AIR AND THE OCEAN WHEN THEIR HORSES SHAKE THEIR MANES
ALL AROUND THE VALLEY WERE HIGH HILLS WITH DARK PINES ON THEM FAR OFF WERE THE MOUNTAINS IN THE VALLEY WERE HALFDAN'S HOUSES AROUND THEIR SQUARE YARD HOW LITTLE OUR HOUSES LOOK DOWN THERE HARALD SAID
ON THE VERY NORTHERN SHORES OF CANADA BUT ONCE THEY LIVED FARTHER SOUTH IN PLEASANTER LANDS
A BAND OF GOLD HELD DOWN HIS LONG YELLOW HAIR IT WAS A WILD COUNTRY THAT THESE TWO WERE WALKING OVER THEY WERE CLIMBING STEEP ROUGH HILLS SOME OF THEM SEEMED MADE ALL OF ROCK WITH A LITTLE EARTH LYING IN SPOTS
ERIC LED HIS WIFE THORHILD AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF
THORKEL WAS STANDING BY MY SIDE AT THAT HE LAUGHED AND SAID THEY DO NOT ANSWER HE LEFT BUT A HANDFUL TO GUARD HIS SHIPS
WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO FACE THE WAR FLASH WHEN HE IS A MAN HO I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE WAR FLASH NOW CRIED HARALD HE THREW BACK HIS CAPE AND DREW A LITTLE DAGGER FROM HIS BELT
TO TURN SKALDS AND COMPOSE SONGS IN THE NORSE MANNER THIS REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL VOCABULARY AND A ROUGH FEELING FOR SIMPLE RHYTHM BUT AN INTENSITY OF EMOTION AND A GREAT VIVIDNESS OF IMAGE
AND TO MAKE UP SONGS HE WENT MUCH TO THE SMITHY
WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
MOST MEN HAD THEM ERIC THE RED LEIF THE LUCKY HARALD HAIRFAIR ROLF GO AFOOT THE OTHER WAY OF KNOWING
NOR IN ME SHOUTED THORKEL
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT SLAP IN THE FACE I DUNNO'S SHE WILL HE REPLIED COOLLY I DIDN'T SAY FOR SURE WHETHER I'D BE DOWN TONIGHT OR NOT IT'S SO LONG SINCE I HAD A CHAT WITH YOU I THOUGHT I'D DROP IN FOR A SPELL BUT OF COURSE IF I'M NOT WANTED I CAN GO WHERE I WILL BE
SHE RUSHED PAST ME UNHEEDING AND FLED DOWN THE HALL LIKE A HUNTED CREATURE AND I HEARD THE HEAVY DOOR CLANG HOLLOWLY BEHIND HER AS FOR ME I STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE DEAD MAN FOR I COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR SPEAK AND WAS LIKE TO HAVE DIED OF HORROR
IF NOT BEFORE I HAVE BACKED MASCOT YOU LU LU SHE ANSWERED QUICKLY IT ALMOST SEEMED DEFIANTLY
I NEVER CARED FOR EXCITEMENT YOU KNOW I CAME DOWN HERE TO ATTEND A SALE OF SOME RARE EDITIONS AND A WELL MEANING FRIEND DRAGGED ME OUT TO SEE THE RACES I FIND IT RATHER INTERESTING I MUST CONFESS
AND DARED LOOK NO MORE ONE MAN WITH WHITE FACE AND SET LIPS WATCHED THE TRACK UNSWERVINGLY AGAIN MASCOT CRAWLED UP
WAS HALF BURIED IN THE SILKEN VIOLET RIM OF THE SEA THE WEST WAS A VAST LAKE OF SAFFRON AND ROSE AND ETHEREAL GREEN THROUGH WHICH FLOATED THE CURVED SHALLOP OF A THIN NEW MOON
MARIAN ROSE AND WENT OVER TO THE COT LAYING HER SLENDER HAND ON THE HOT FOREHEAD OF THE LITTLE SUFFERER THE CHILD OPENED ITS BROWN EYES QUESTIONINGLY HOW ARE YOU TODAY BESSIE MAD'LEN I WANT MAD'LEN
FALLING ATHWART A FROSTED PANE AND OUT FROM IT SWELLED HER GLEAMING BREAST AND ARMS SO BARE THAT IT SEEMED TO ME A SHAME TO LOOK UPON THEM YET IT COULD NOT BE DENIED THEY WERE OF WONDROUS BEAUTY WHITE AS POLISHED MARBLE
HIS EYES LINGERED ON HER IN THE DIM LIGHT TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL OF HER SWEET WOMANLY REFINEMENT AND LOVELINESS AND WITH DIFFICULTY HE CHOKED BACK A GROAN
AFTER THAT MY AUNTS ALSO CAME IN VERY BEAUTIFULLY AND MODESTLY DRESSED BUT THEY SEEMED TO ME AS NOTHING AFTER ALICIA FOR I WAS CAUGHT IN THE SNARE OF HER BEAUTY AND THE LONGING TO SEE HER AGAIN SO GREW UPON ME THAT AFTER A TIME I DID AN UNDUTIFUL AND DISOBEDIENT THING
NOR WAS THE NIGHT BLACKER THAN HIS FACE AND HE TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I RAN AFTER HIM THINKING SELFISHLY OF THE SWEETMEATS HE HAD PROMISED TO BRING ME BUT I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THEM WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR OF THE RED ROOM
AND ALL ABOUT HER SNOWY THROAT AND ROUNDED ARMS AND IN THE MASSES OF HER SPLENDID HAIR WERE SPARKLING GLEAMING STONES WITH HEARTS OF PURE LIGHT
ESTERBROOK SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE AND LEFT THE ANIMAL STANDING BY ITSELF WHILE HE WALKED SWIFTLY OUT TO HER HIS HEART THROBBED SUFFOCATINGLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF NO DIRECT PURPOSE SAVE MERELY TO SEE HER SHE TURNED WHEN HE REACHED HER WITH A SLIGHT START OF SURPRISE
WITH A MUTTERED OATH NOR WAS HE STAYED MY UNCLE TURNED TO ALICIA AND VERY CALMLY AND TERRIBLY HE SAID FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE NO LONGER WIFE OF MINE
I DO NOT THINK WE ARE AS WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER AFTER ALL AS WE HAVE FANCIED
MY ALARM WAS FOR YOU YOU ARE TOO PRECIOUS TO ME MARIAN FOR ME TO PERMIT YOU TO RISK HEALTH AND LIFE IF IT WERE DANGEROUS WHAT A LADY BOUNTIFUL YOU ARE TO THOSE PEOPLE AT THE COVE WHEN WE ARE MARRIED YOU MUST TAKE ME IN HAND AND TEACH ME YOUR CREED OF CHARITY
ESTERBROOK MADE NO ANSWER HE BOWED HIS PALE MISERABLE FACE BEFORE HER SELF CONDEMNED THE BREAST OF THE BAY SPARKLED WITH ITS COUNTLESS GEMS LIKE THE BREAST OF A FAIR WOMAN
ANNE STOCKARD AT HER BEST HAD NEVER BEEN PRETTY WHEN YOUNG SHE HAD BEEN CALLED GAWKY SHE WAS VERY TALL AND HER FIGURE WAS LANK AND ANGULAR SHE HAD A LONG PALE FACE AND DUSKY HAIR HER EYES HAD BEEN GOOD A GLIMMERING HAZEL LARGE AND LONG LASHED
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU MAY LAUGH IF YOU LIKE
SHE WAS AN OLD MAID AND HARRIET WARREN WAS YOUNG AND PRETTY ANNE'S LONG THIN LIPS SUDDENLY QUIVERED I DECLARE I'M A WORSE FOOL THAN JEROME SHE SAID ANGRILY WHEN SATURDAY NIGHT CAME JEROME DID NOT
HE SAW NOTHING OF HER WHEN HE REACHED THE COVE HE COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE FOR CALLING AT THE BARRETT COTTAGE SO HE RODE SLOWLY PAST THE HAMLET AND ALONG THE SHORE THE SUN RED AS A SMOULDERING EMBER
AND THAT HE DID LOVE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD WITH A PASSION THAT THREATENED TO SWEEP BEFORE IT EVERY VESTIGE OF HIS HONOUR AND LOYALTY HE HAD SEEN HER BUT THREE TIMES AND HIS THROBBING HEART LAY IN THE HOLLOW OF HER COLD WHITE HAND HE SHUT HIS EYES AND GROANED
STOOPING TO BRUSH HER CHEEK AGAINST A DEW COLD MILK WHITE ACACIA BLOOM AND WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO ME AGAIN IF THAT COULD HAPPEN I WONDER WHAT THERE WOULD BE LEFT TO LIVE FOR
ANNE LOOK HERE DIDN'T I COME AFTER YOU FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
THAT IS ALL I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO BE BROTHER AND SISTER FOREVER NOTHING MORE ESTERBROOK SPRANG TO HIS FEET MARIAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
NOR DID HE EVER SEEM OTHER THAN A COURTEOUS AND RESPECTFUL HUSBAND NOR DID MISSUS MONTRESSOR AND MY AUNTS THOUGH THEY WONDERED MUCH AMONG THEMSELVES LEARN AUGHT FOR THEY DARED QUESTION NEITHER THEIR BROTHER NOR ALICIA WHO CARRIED HERSELF AS LOFTILY AS EVER
A GREAT JOY WAS SURGING UP IN HIS HEART YET IT WAS MINGLED WITH GREAT REGRET HE KNEW NONE BETTER WHAT WAS PASSING OUT OF HIS LIFE WHAT HE WAS LOSING WHEN HE LOST THAT PURE WOMANLY NATURE IF YOU REALLY MEAN THIS MARIAN HE SAID SLOWLY
SUCH AS RAN NOT IN THE BLUE VEINS OF THE MONTRESSORS SOME HAD MUCH TO SAY OF HER PRIDE AND INSOLENCE AND WONDERED IF MISSUS MONTRESSOR WOULD TAMELY YIELD HER MISTRESS SHIP TO THE STRANGER
FOR NEVER HAD I SEEN SUCH LOVELINESS AND HARDLY DREAMED IT
WELL SPIRITS THEN TO RETURN AFTER DEATH OR TO APPEAR TO ANYONE APART FROM THE FLESH
ALTHOUGH MY GOOD AUNTS SUPPOSED THAT SUCH A CHIT AS I WOULD TAKE NO HEED TO THEIR WHISPERINGS WHEN I WAS NOT WITH THEM HELPING TO WHIP EGGS AND STONE RAISINS AND BEING WATCHED TO SEE THAT I ATE NOT MORE THAN ONE OUT OF FIVE I WAS SURELY TO BE FOUND IN THE WING HALL PORING OVER MY BOOK AND GRIEVING
ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT WATCHED THE TWO WOMEN INTENTLY THE ONE STANDING BY THE COT ARRAYED IN SIMPLE YET COSTLY APPAREL WITH HER BEAUTIFUL HIGH BRED FACE AND THE OTHER KNEELING ON THE BARE SANDED FLOOR IN HER PRINT DRESS WITH HER SPLENDID HEAD BENT LOW OVER THE CHILD
AND THOUGH I BORE ME BRAVELY MY AUNTS DISCOVERED IT SOON WHEN DESPITE MY PITEOUS PLEADINGS I WAS PUT TO BED WHERE I CRIED BITTERLY AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED FOR I THOUGHT I SHOULD NOT SEE THE FINE FOLK AND MORE THAN ALL ALICIA
AS EMBRACED HIM HER VOICE WAS WONDROUS SWEET AND CARESSING AS SHE MURMURED IN HIS EAR HE LAUGHED AND HIS BROW CLEARED THOUGH HE SAID STILL STERNLY DO NOT TRY ME TOO FAR ALICIA THEN THEY WENT OUT
BUT I HAVE CONQUERED MYSELF I WILL BE TRUE TO THE WOMAN TO WHOM I AM PLEDGED YOU AND I MUST NOT MEET AGAIN I WILL CRUSH THIS MADNESS TO DEATH I THINK I HAVE BEEN DELIRIOUS EVER SINCE THAT DAY I SAW YOU FIRST MAGDALEN
YES DARLING MAD'LEN IS HERE RIGHT BESIDE YOU SHE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU SHE KNELT BY THE LITTLE COT AND PASSED HER ARM UNDER THE CHILD'S NECK DRAWING THE CURLY HEAD CLOSE TO HER THROAT WITH A TENDER SOOTHING MOTION
JEROME'S HAT WENT ONE WAY AND HIS CANE ANOTHER
SIDNEY SAID MIRIAM SIMPLY NONSENSE
HAVE YOU CEASED TO CARE FOR ME THE RIGIDLY LOCKED HANDS WERE CLASPED A LITTLE TIGHTER NO I SHALL ALWAYS CARE FOR YOU AS MY FRIEND IF YOU WILL LET ME BUT I KNOW WE COULD NOT MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY
BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE PLACE MY UNCLE HUGH AND HIS BRIDE WERE GONE FOR A TIME AND I HAD EVEN TO SWALLOW MY DISAPPOINTMENT AND BIDE THEIR RETURN WITH ALL MY SMALL PATIENCE BUT MY AUNTS AND THEIR STEPMOTHER TALKED MUCH OF ALICIA AND THEY SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF HER
THE FRIENDS REALLY WORTH HAVING WERE STILL HERS HER MOTHER'S FACE HAD LOST ITS LOOK OF CARE AND HER BUSINESS WAS PROSPERING SHE WAS HOPEFUL AND WIDE AWAKE KEPT HER WITS ABOUT HER AND LOOKED OUT FOR HINTS AND LEARNED TO LAUGH OVER HER FAILURES
DOWN ON THE SANDY STRIP OF BEACH BELOW THE HOUSES GROUPS OF MEN WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THE MACKEREL SEASON HAD NOT YET SET IN THE SPRING HERRING NETTING WAS PAST IT WAS HOLIDAY TIME AMONG THE SEA FOLKS THEY WERE ENJOYING IT TO THE FULL
AND INTO THESE ALL THE WORKING GIRLS FROM WILLINGTON HAD CROWDED
NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE REACHED THE ROAD BRANCHING OFF TO THE COVE HE TURNED HIS HORSE DOWN IT WITH A FLUSH ON HIS DARK CHEEK HE REALIZED THAT THE MOTIVE OF THE ACTION WAS DISLOYAL TO MARIAN AND HE FELT ASHAMED OF HIS WEAKNESS BUT THE DESIRE TO SEE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD ONCE MORE AND TO LOOK INTO THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES WAS STRONGER THAN ALL ELSE AND OVERPOWERED EVERY THROB OF DUTY AND RESISTANCE
BUT HE KEPT HIS HEAD AND WENT ON COURTING ANNE JUST THE SAME THAT IS HE WENT OVER TO ESEK STOCKARD'S HOUSE EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SPENT THE EVENING HE WALKED HOME WITH ANNE FROM PRAYER MEETING AND SINGING SCHOOL AND PARTIES WHEN SHE WOULD LET HIM
COULD HE NOT HAVE HIS BRIDE IN AUGUST FOR A FLEETING SECOND MARIAN CLOSED HER EYES AND THE SLENDER HANDS LYING AMONG THE LACES IN HER LAP CLASPED EACH OTHER CONVULSIVELY THEN SHE SAID QUIETLY
THE WONDROUS WATER OF BEAUTY THAT MADE OLD WRINKLED FACES LOOK YOUNG SMOOTH AND BLOOMING AGAIN WAS THE SPECIAL MERCHANDISE OF THE COUNTESS AND WAS OF COURSE
AN ANSWER TO MY NOTE SAID THE JEWELER MADAME REMEMBERED A NOTE WHICH THE QUEEN HAD RECEIVED FROM BOEHMER A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE ALONG WITH SOME ORNAMENTS SENT BY HIS HANDS TO HER AS A PRESENT FROM THE KING
HE ALWAYS SOLD A GOOD ARTICLE AND NO PERSON WHO PURCHASED FROM HIM HAD CAUSE TO COMPLAIN I CONFESS I FELT SOMEWHAT CHAGRINED THAT THE MONSIEUR HAD THUS SUDDENLY TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE
THE UNFORTUNATE QUEEN NEVER ENTIRELY ESCAPED SOME SHADOW OF DISREPUTE FROM THE NECKLACE BUSINESS FOR TO THE VERY LAST BOTH ON THE TRIAL AND AFTERWARDS JEANNE DE LAMOTTE IMPUDENTLY STUCK TO IT
AFTER TAKING A REST HE WOULD COMMENCE A NEW SPEECH WHEN I WAS MODESTLY DRESSED LIKE ANY OF MY HEARERS
HE WOULD TAKE A BLANK CARD AND WITH ONE OF HIS PENCILS WOULD PRETEND TO BE DRAWING THE PORTRAIT OF SOME MAN STANDING NEAR HIM THEN SHOWING HIS PICTURE TO THE CROWD IT PROVED TO BE THE HEAD OF A DONKEY
OF HIS OWN AND THE EGYPTIAN RACE HE SPOKE OF HIS PERSONAL INTIMACY WITH ALL THE TWELVE APOSTLES AND EVEN THE AUGUST PRESENCE OF THE SAVIOR AND ONE OF HIS PRETENSIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST SINGULARLY AMUSING HAD IT NOT BORDERED UPON PROFANITY
THE BROTHERS GOT MAD AND FLATLY REFUSED THEN THEY COOLED DOWN AND ARGUED SAYING IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AND WAS OF NO USE WELL SAID THE ANCIENT MARINER IF IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
HE DOUBLES THE TWO FOLDS MADE BY THE INQUIRER AND FOR A SHOW OF CONSISTENCY AGAIN RUBS HIS FINGERS OVER THE PAPER THEN MORE FOLDS AND MORE RUBBING ALL THE FOLDING ADDITIONAL TO THE INQUIRER'S BEING DONE TO KEEP THE LATTER FROM OBSERVING WHEN HE COMES TO READ THE ANSWER
RENDERED HIM AN IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION ESPECIALLY TO THE LADIES
AND HAD BEEN FOOLED TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT BY THE CUNNING JOSEPH THESE LETTERS INTRODUCED OUR HUMBUG INTO THE FIRST FAMILIES OF ROME WHO LIKE SOME OTHER FIRST FAMILIES
HIS FACTORY WAS AT HIS RESIDENCE IN HUDSON STREET HE PUT UP A LARGE GILT SIGN OVER THE SUN OFFICE FIVE OR SIX FEET WIDE BY THE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING WHICH ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AS AT THAT TIME IT WAS PROBABLY THE LARGEST SIGN IN NEW YORK
THIS IS A PRINTED CIRCULAR APPEALING TO A CLASS OF FOOLS IF POSSIBLE EVEN SHALLOWER SILLIER AND MORE CREDULOUS THAN ANY I HAVE NAMED YET IT IS HEADED THE GYPSIES SEVEN SECRET CHARMS THESE CHARMS CONSIST OF A KIND OF HELLBROTH OR DECOCTION
ARE YOU HAPPY BEING A QUESTION COMMONLY ASKED THE SPIRITS ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN VARIED IT BY ASKING ARE YOU HUNGRY THE REPLY WAS AN EMPHATIC AFFIRMATIVE THEY TRICKED THE TRICKSTER IN OTHER WAYS ONE OF WHICH WAS TO WRITE THE NAMES OF MORTALS INSTEAD OF SPIRITS
RATHER TOO LARGE A SUM TO KEEP LOCKED UP IN A CASKET THE READER WILL CONFESS
THE QUEEN BURNED THE NOTE SHE DOES NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT BY WRITING THAT NOTE THIS STATEMENT VERY QUICKLY ELICITED FROM THE NOW STARTLED GERMAN A STORY WHICH ASTOUNDED THE LADY HE SAID THE QUEEN OWED HIM
ARRIVING AT HIS DESTINED STOPPING PLACE HIS CARRIAGE HALTED HIS SERVANT HANDED HIM A CASE FROM WHICH HE TOOK SEVERAL LARGE PORTRAITS OF HIMSELF WHICH HE HUNG PROMINENTLY UPON THE SIDES OF HIS CARRIAGE
THESE WORDS ARE EXACTLY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT IS SOLD BY THE WITCHES OF TO DAY BUT THE GREATEST WITCH HUMBUG OF ALL THE WITCHCRAFT OF HISTORY IS THAT OF CHRISTENDOM FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEGINNING ABOUT THE TIME OF THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME I ALSO KNOW VERY WELL INDEED BUT HAVE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR NOT MENTIONING WENT ONE DAY TO SEE THIS TEST MEDIUM ALONG WITH A FRIEND AND ASKED TO SEE A HAND
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BECOME THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH THE NOTIONS OF SWEDENBORG MESMER AND THE FAMOUS RICHARD BROTHERS AND WAS QUITE RIPE FOR ANYTHING FANTASTIC SUCH A CONVERT WAS A PERFECT GODSEND TO JOANNA
AND THAT AS FOR THE NECKLACE HE HAD BETTER PICK IT TO PIECES AND SELL IT THE POOR GERMAN
TO THOSE DISPOSED TO HAVE A SOUVENIR OF THE GREAT HUMBUG HE WOULD SELL SIX PENCILS A MEDAL AND A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF FOR A FRANC TWENTY CENTS
AND STILL MORE PARTICULARLY CONDUCTING A GREAT MANY EXPERIMENTS ON THE CARDINAL'S REMARKABLY FINE STOCK OF TOKAY WINE WHATEVER POOR DE ROHAN HAD TO DO HE CONSULTED CAGLIOSTRO ABOUT IT AND WHEN THE LATTER WENT TO SWITZERLAND
THE LAWS OF LIFE ARE WRITTEN UPON THE FACE OF NATURE THE TEMPEST WHIRLWIND AND THUNDER STORM BRING HEALTH FROM THE SOLITUDES OF GOD THE TIDES ARE THE DAILY AGITATORS AND PURIFIERS OF THE MIGHTY WORLD OF WATERS
THE AUDIENCE BECAME DISGUSTED AND ENRAGED AT THE IMPUDENCE OF THE IMPOSTURE BROKE OVER THE FOOT LIGHTS KNOCKED FERGUSON BACKWARD INTO THE CABINET AND WHEN THE DISCOMFITED AGENT HAD SCRAMBLED OUT AND RUN AWAY SMASHED THE THING FAIRLY INTO KINDLING WOOD
FOR HER AND BY HIM TO HER NOW THE QUEEN AS MADAME CAMPAN KNEW VERY WELL HAD ALWAYS STRONGLY DISLIKED THIS CARDINAL HE HAD EVEN BEEN KEPT FROM ATTENDING AT COURT IN CONSEQUENCE
AT OFFENBURG WHEN THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN TORTURED UNTIL BEYOND THE POWER OF SPEAKING ALOUD THEY SILENTLY ASSENTED TO ABOMINABLE CONFESSIONS READ TO THEM OUT OF A BOOK
SUPPOSING THE NAMES WRITTEN WERE MARY JOSEPH AND SAMUEL BEING RESPECTIVELY THE INVESTIGATOR'S MOTHER FATHER AND BROTHER THE LAST NAMED CLASS WOULD BE SECONDLY WRITTEN
BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA THE JEWISH WITCH WAS A MERE DIVINER OR AT MOST A RAISER OF THE DEAD AND THE GENTILE WITCH WAS A POISONER A MAKER OF PHILTRES OR LOVE POTIONS AND A VULGAR SORT OF MAGICIAN
BUT IT IS ONE GRAND SECRET
AS SOON AS HE SAW WHAT KNOT MISTER CUMMINS WAS GOING TO USE CUMMINS HOWEVER THOUGH IRA SQUIRMED MOST INDUSTRIOUSLY GOT HIM TIED FAST AND THEN IRA CALLED TO FERGUSON TO CUT THE KNOT FERGUSON DID SO
AS THE COBBLER DID THE ELEPHANT HE WON IN A RAFFLE AND TRIED SO PERSEVERINGLY TO INDUCE THE QUEEN TO BUY IT THAT HE BECAME A REAL TORMENT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT HIM A LITTLE CRACKED ON THE SUBJECT
ONE OF THE ARTISTS PRECEDED THE OTHER BY A FEW HOURS ENGAGED ROOMS AND ATTENDED TO SUNDRY PRELIMINARIES MISTER HOWARD DONNED A WHITE CHOKER PUT HIS HAIR BEHIND HIS EARS
AND THE HAPPY OWNERS GLOATED WITH DELIGHT OVER A MONUMENT OF SKILL AS MATCHLESS IN ITS WAY AS THE PYRAMIDS THEMSELVES BUT ALAS
ARE AT THE SERVICE OF HIS LIEGE LADY HIS PURSE IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED WITH INFINITE SHYNESS AND CIRCUMSPECTION THE COUNTESS GRADUALLY HALF UNWILLINGLY LETS HIM FIND OUT THAT IT IS THE DIAMOND NECKLACE
FROM PETERSBURG HE WENT TO BERLIN WHERE HE AT ONCE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF FREDERICK THE GREAT WHO QUESTIONED VOLTAIRE ABOUT HIM THE LATTER REPLYING AS IT IS SAID THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW ALL THINGS
AND WITH IMMENSE PRECAUTIONS THIS OSTRICH OF A CARDINAL WAS ONE NIGHT INTRODUCED INTO THE GARDENS OF THE TRIANON AND SHOWN A LITTLE NOOK AMONG THE THICKETS WHERE A STATELY FEMALE IN THE SIMILITUDE OF THE QUEEN RECEIVED HIM WITH SOFT SPOKEN WORDS
WITH ONLY FIFTY POUNDS LEFT OUT OF THREE THOUSAND WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE INCIDENT OF CAGLIOSTRO'S ENGLISH EXPERIENCE WAS THE AFFAIR OF THE ARSENICAL PIGS A NOTICE OF WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN THE PUBLIC ADVERTISER
AND OTHER HUMBUGS THE CARDINAL SENT AN INTIMATION THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE QUACK THE QUACK WHOSE IMPUDENCE WAS FAR GREATER THAN THE CARDINAL'S PRIDE SENT BACK THIS SUBLIME REPLY IF HE IS SICK LET HIM COME TO ME
GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR TRIAL THIS WAS A PUBLIC TRIAL BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT OF PARIS WITH MUCH FORM
HE RAISED HIS HAND AND HIS SERVANT UNDERSTANDING THE SIGN STOPPED THE ORGAN
THE MEDIUM LIKE MANY OTHERS INCORRECTLY PRONOUNCED THE TERM DECEASED
HIS CAREER AND TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE CONTINENT WERE MULTIFORM IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS MIXED UP WITH THE DYNASTIC CONSPIRACIES AND CHANGES AT SAINT PETERSBURG
AND TOLD ANECDOTES THAT THE RESEARCHES OF SCHOLARS AFTERWARDS FULLY VERIFIED HIS PREDICTIONS WERE INDEED
TO RESTORE IT TO ITS PRISTINE GLORY IN FACT THIS PRETENSION WHICH INFLUENCED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF BELIEVERS WAS ONE OF THE MOST DARING IMPOSTURES THAT EVER SAW THE LIGHT AND IT IS ASTOUNDING TO THINK THAT SO LATE AS SEVENTEEN EIGHTY
BUT I GET NO ASSISTANCE FROM ROGER AT THIS POINT HE PRETENDS THAT HE HAS A MIND FAR ABOVE THE GOSSIP OF THE LOWER ORDERS I SAY SAID CORONEL AS THEY WENT UP THE GRAND STAIRCASE I AM NOT A PRINCE YOU KNOW DON'T SAY I HAVE DECEIVED YOU
BUT HE SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF EVEN SUPPOSING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT I AM A RABBIT I STILL HAVE SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE I'LL COME AND
HE MUST BE LONGING TO TELL YOU THAT OH HE'LL HAVE A HUNDRED THINGS TO TELL YOU FIRST BUT THEN WHEN HE SAYS AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE THEN YOU CAN SAY
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN THE EXACT MOMENT IN THE THROES OF COMPOSITION BELVANE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE APPLE PIE BED SO ABSORBING IS OUR PROFESSION
WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE KNOWN YET SHE SAID SHYLY BUT YOU HAVE GUESSED OUR SECRET YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHE LOOKED MODESTLY AT THE GROUND AND FEELING FOR HER RELUCTANT LOVER'S HAND WENT ON
BUT I THINK I HAVE NOTHING IN MY GARDEN AT THIS MOMENT
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
I RODE SAID CORONEL IT'S A SECRET HE ADDED
THERE ARE CERTAIN STATE REASONS HE SAID WITH DIGNITY WHY THAT STORY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GET ABOUT PARDON YOUR MAJESTY I HAVE NO WISH TO BUT AS YOU KNOW SO MUCH YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW ALL
TELL HIM ABOUT HOW YOU FOUGHT THE KING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR AND HOW YOU PRETENDED TO BE A SWINEHERD AND HOW COULD ANY FATHER HAVE RESISTED IN A LITTLE WHILE HYACINTH AND CORONEL WERE SEATED EAGERLY AT HIS FEET
TO WHICH THE RING ENTITLED HER SHE DREW THE RING OUT FROM ITS HIDING PLACE ROUND HER NECK I WISH SHE SAID HOLDING IT UP I WISH THAT THE COUNTESS BELVANE SHE STOPPED
HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND ADDRESSED HIS TROOPS MEN OF EURALIA CHEERS WE HAVE RETURNED FROM A LONG AND ARDUOUS CONFLICT CHEERS TO THE EMBRACES LOUD CHEERS
INTO THE MYSTERIES OF HIS TOILET WE HAD PERHAPS BETTER NOT INQUIRE AS THE CHRONICLER OF THESE SIMPLE HAPPENINGS MANY YEARS AGO
AND ROGER SCURVILEGS WHO TAKE THESE NARROW MATTER OF FACT VIEWS ONE MERELY WASTES TIME IN ARGUING WITH THEM MY PLANS SHE REPEATED
WE WILL BE HER MOST HUMBLE OBEDIENT SERVANTS SHE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING SHE WANTS INCLUDING PRINCE UDO SMILED HYACINTH THAT'S A SPLENDID IDEA WE'LL MAKE HER HAVE UDO
MY DEAR THIS IS INDEED NEWS TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT UPON WHAT QUEST DID YOU SEND HIM HYACINTH HAD FELT THIS COMING
WIGGS HE SAID SOLEMNLY IF EVER YOU CAN DO
THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
THE PRINCESS AND CORONEL WERE UPON THEM AH COUNTESS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND YOU TOGETHER SAID HYACINTH ARCHLY LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND THE DUKE CORONEL
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS ONCE MORE HE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS MIDNIGHT VISIT AND OF THE KING'S LETTER TO HIM BUT YOUR MAJESTY CRIED CORONEL
HE ASKED I DON'T MIND WHAT YOU ARE BUT YOU'LL NEVER DARE SHOW YOURSELF IN THE COUNTRY LIKE THIS BE CAREFUL WOMAN DON'T DRIVE ME TOO FAR
NEATLY TIED UP WITH BLUE RIBBON FATHER HE PICKED OUT THE LEFT ONE FONS ET ORIGO IF HE HAD KNOWN ANY LATIN OF THE WAR AND HELD IT UP FOR HYACINTH'S INSPECTION THERE YOU CAN SEE THE PLACE WHERE HENRY SMALLNOSE'S ARROW BENT IT
SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THIS WAS HER ONLY WORK BUT SHE BUILT UP SOME REPUTATION ON IT AND BELVANE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER GENIUS TO BE EXACT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MEN
NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE HE WAITED NERVOUSLY WONDERING IF HYACINTH WOULD REALISE THAT ALL WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE MORE PARTICULARLY BELVANE HYACINTH DREW A STOOL UP TO HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND SAT DOWN VERY CLOSE TO HIM
AN APPLE PIE BED FOR THE COUNTESS IT WAS THE MOST PERFECT APPLE PIE BED EVER MADE COX HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED UPON IT
TO THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY ANNOY HER I WISH THAT THE COUNTESS
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
THEN I SHALL SAY NOTHING MUCH ONLY CORONEL AND SUCH A CLEVER OH I HAVE MY IDEAS SAID CORONEL WELL I'LL BE OUT OF THE WAY SOMEWHERE I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOREST
HE PATTED HER AGAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE SHE AND NOT HIMSELF WHO WAS IN DANGER OF BREAKING DOWN MY LITTLE HYACINTH MY OWN LITTLE GIRL OH FATHER I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK THERE THERE MY CHILD
FATHER WILL MAKE YOU A PROPER PRINCE DIRECTLY HE COMES BACK WILL HE THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING YOU SEE HE DOESN'T KNOW YET ABOUT OUR LITTLE PRESENT TO THE COUNTESS BUT IT IS QUITE TIME WE GOT BACK TO BELVANE WE HAVE LEFT HER ALONE TOO LONG
SHE TOOK UNFLINCHING WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN HER LIFE THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY IN THE PALACE SHE SAID IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME
EQUALLY CERTAIN WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION THE BAD WISH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM
VERY WELL I SHALL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCESS AND SHE WILL UNMASK YOU BEFORE THE PEOPLE BELVANE SMILED HAPPILY ONE DOES NOT OFTEN GET SUCH A CHANCE
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
PROTESTED UDO INDIGNANTLY
ALL APPARENTLY BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT THEM FOR A MOMENT IN SIGHT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED PRINCE AND THEN WHISKED THEM OFF HAND TO MOUTH AND SHOULDERS SHAKING BY ONE OF THESE
HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
AND WHO MIGHT CORONEL BE SAID THE KING RATHER STERNLY HE'S HE'S WELL HE'S HERE HE IS FATHER SHE RAN UP TO HIM IMPULSIVELY AS HE CAME IN AT THE DOOR
BUTTERFLY BUT WIGGS HAD LET GO HER HAND AND WAS RUNNING BACK TO THE PALACE SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE TO THINK THIS OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU MISUNDERSTAND ANY OF THEM BUT WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THEM THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING IN HER DEFENCE ABOUT HER AT ANY RATE
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
HE TOLD HER OF HIS SECRET JOURNEY TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S TENT HE TOLD HER OF THE KING OF BARODIA'S LETTER
COME WITH US THEN SAID THE MAIDENS AND THEY LED HIM DOWN A PASSAGE INTO A HALL OUT OF WHICH OPENED MANY CHAMBERS EACH ONE OF GREATER SPLENDOUR THAN THE LAST FROM A SHELF HEAPED UP WITH GOLD AND JEWELS
AND PUT THE PACKETS CAREFULLY AWAY IN HIS TURBAN THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN DORANI LEFT FOR HER FATHER'S HOUSE IN HER PALANQUIN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PACKET OF THE MAGIC POWDER AND SPRINKLED IT OVER HIMSELF AND THEN HURRIED AFTER HER
I WAS THERE ANSWERED THE PRINCE BUT WHY DO YOU FOLLOW ME ASKED THE GIRL BECAUSE REPLIED THE PRINCE I LOVE YOU AND TO BE WITH YOU IS HAPPINESS
AND SEIZING THE SERPENT WITH SOME PINCERS THAT HE HELD IN ONE HAND HE CUT OFF ITS HEAD WITH A SHARP DAGGER THE KING COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING HIS NEW SON IN LAW CRAVED AN AUDIENCE OF HIS MAJESTY WHAT YOU
AND BEFORE NIGHTFALL THEY HAD WHISPERED THAT IF AT THE END OF TWO DAYS RAIN HAD NOT COME THEY MUST FLY AWAY AND SEEK A NEW HOME FOR IF THEY STAYED IN THEIR OLD ONE WHICH THEY LOVED SO MUCH
HIS SON'S AFFAIR AND THE GIRL WOULD SURELY SOON GET TIRED OF GOING TO AND FRO SO HE MADE NO DIFFICULTY AND EVERYTHING WAS SPEEDILY ARRANGED AND THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT REJOICINGS AT FIRST
BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BRACELET ASKED THE JEW IT BELONGS TO ME NO IT IS MINE REPLIED THE BOY IT IS NOT GIVE IT TO ME AT ONCE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU CRIED THE JEW
HOWEVER HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF YOU MUST NOT FEEL AFRAID NOR MOVE YOUR FEET NOR OPEN YOUR MOUTH NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE OR HEAR IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDFUL FOR YOU TO BE PERFECTLY STILL
AH THE POOR CHILD FEELS LOST AND UNHAPPY SHE THOUGHT PITIFULLY FOR HER HEART WAS KIND WELL I HAVE JUST DONE AND THEN MY SON AND I WILL GO TO FETCH HER WHEN SHE SEES HOW HANDSOME HE IS SHE WILL BE ALL SMILES AGAIN
AND WHAT SHALL I DO THERE SHE ASKED
THE OFTENER SHE REPEATED THE WORDS AND AT LAST A DAY ARRIVED WHEN SHE COULD BEAR THE SILENCE AND SOLITUDE NO LONGER AND SET OFF TO WALK TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE TO BEG SOMEONE TO SELL HER OR LEND HER A CHILD THE SNOW WAS VERY DEEP
AND WITH A YELL OF PAIN AND ANGER SHE VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS AMEER ALI THEN SAT DOWN TO COLLECT HIMSELF A LITTLE AND FELT UPON THE GROUND BY HIS SIDE AN ANKLET THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN OFF THE OLD WITCH'S FOOT
AND REALLY WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY SHE VENTURED TO WALK ABOUT BY HERSELF AND WOVE HERSELF A BED OF SOME BLADES OF GRASS AND PLACED IT UNDER A CLOVER LEAF FOR SHELTER THE RED CUPS THAT GREW IN THE MOSS HELD AS MUCH DEW AS SHE WANTED AND THE COCKCHAFER HAD TAUGHT HER HOW TO GET HONEY
THAT THE PRINCESS FELL STILL MORE IN LOVE WITH HIM THAN BEFORE AND WHEN HE SAW HER AND RECOGNISED HER AS THE LADY WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DREAMT OF HE IMMEDIATELY ASKED HER TO BE HIS BRIDE THE PRINCESS LOOKED DOWN AND SMILED AS SHE ANSWERED HIM
MAKE NO NOISE SO THAT NO ONE MAY GUESS YOU ARE NOT DEAD SHE SAID TO NIGHT I WILL BRING YOU SOME MORE FOOD AND I WILL TELL THE MOLE THAT HE MUST STUFF UP THE HOLE AGAIN AS IT MAKES THE PASSAGE TOO COLD FOR ME TO WALK IN AND NOW FAREWELL
THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AGAIN AS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE BUT DORANI SANG
AND THAT UNLESS HE COULD BE CURED WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WOULD SURELY DIE THE PRINCESS THOUGHT OF THE SNAKES AND THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND LIFTING HER HEAD FROM THE POTS AND PANS SHE WAS SCOURING SHE SAID I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A SOUP THAT HAS SUCH A WONDERFUL POWER
BUT HE HATED THE SUN AND THE TREES AND THE FLOWERS AND ALL THAT MAIA LOVED BEST TO BE SURE BEING BLIND HE HAD NEVER SEEN THEM AND LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE HE THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING HE DID NOT KNOW WAS NOT WORTH KNOWING BUT MAIA'S TALES AMUSED HIM
I FEEL FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED REPEATED THE BOY WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE FRIGHTENED WELL JUST FRIGHTENED ANSWERED THE MOTHER
WHEN SHE HAD QUITE FINISHED SHE PUT OUT HER HAND AND SMILED AND THE OLD MOUSE SAID TO HER CAN YOU TELL STORIES IF SO YOU MAY STAY WITH ME TILL THE SUN GETS HOT AGAIN AND YOU SHALL HELP ME WITH MY HOUSE BUT IT IS DULL HERE IN THE WINTER UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEBODY CLEVER ENOUGH TO AMUSE YOU
AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
A VISION SWIFTER THAN LIGHTNING FLASHED ACROSS HIS BRAIN HE SAW HIMSELF SEATED ON A THRONE SPENDING HIS LIFE TRYING AND NEVER SUCCEEDING TO MAKE POOR PEOPLE RICH MISERABLE PEOPLE HAPPY
RETIRED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS TO SUP BY THEMSELVES FOR SUCH WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
I HOPE SO INDEED ANSWERED THE BOY AND HE SET OUT AT ONCE HE SOON BEHELD THE WATERS OF THE POOL GLEAMING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND AS HE DREW NEAR HE SAW A TALL SWING STANDING JUST OVER IT
SHE ADDED DROPPING HER VOICE OH GOOD MISTER MOLE DO TAKE ME TO SEE IT
EVEN IF WE FIND IT THIS EVENING THE HUNDRED DAYS WILL BE OVER IN AN HOUR AND LONG BEFORE WE COULD REACH THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL THE DOCTOR WILL BE ON HIS WAY HOME STILL I WILL GO OUT AGAIN AND CAST THE NET ONCE MORE MYSELF
THE STRANGE KING HAPPENED TO BE IN A GOOD HUMOUR AND THEY WERE READILY ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE LAYING DOWN HIS OFFERINGS ON THE STEPS OF THE THRONE HE PRAYED THE KING TO GRANT HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE THE MONARCH LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE BUT ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE
AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
SO THE KING CALLED THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM BUT WHILST THE DISPUTE WAS GOING ON THE KING AND QUEEN HAD GOT SO EXCITED AND TALKED SO LOUD THAT THE GUARDS HAD HEARD NEARLY ALL THEY SAID AND ONE MAN OBSERVED TO THE OTHER
WHO HAD WATCHED ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS WITH GREAT WONDER SEIZED IT BY ONE LEG AS IT FLEW AWAY AND FOUND HIMSELF BEING BORNE THROUGH THE AIR AT A RAPID RATE IN A SHORT WHILE THEY ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE FAIRY
AND MAIA SMILED AND STOOD BESIDE HIM AS ALL THE FAIRIES THAT DWELT IN THE FLOWERS RAN TO FETCH PRESENTS FOR HER AND THE BEST OF THEM ALL WAS A PAIR OF LOVELY GAUZY BLUE WINGS TO HELP FLY ABOUT LIKE ONE OF THEMSELVES
AND AT LAST HE DROPPED ON THE GROUND FROM SHEER FATIGUE AND MUST HAVE ROLLED DOWN THE HOLE INTO THE PASSAGE IT WAS VERY LUCKY FOR THE SWALLOW THAT BOTH THE MOLE AND THE FIELD MOUSE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD AND DID NOT TROUBLE ABOUT HIM
THEN HE TOLD HER HIS STORY AND SHE WENT WITHIN THE COTTAGE AND CAME BACK WITH TWO WANDS AND A POT OF BOILING WATER THE TWO WANDS SHE PLANTED IN THE GROUND ABOUT SIX FEET APART AND THEN TURNING TO HIM SHE SAID
IT IS TOO LATE MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD STUDIED IN THE SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALL THE SAME PUT THE FISH IN THAT VESSEL FULL OF WATER AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO SHOW MY FATHER THAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD BUT WHEN HE DREW NEAR THE FISH IT LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH SUCH PITEOUS EYES
FOR THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY MONTHS THAT THE PRINCESS HAD ASKED HIM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HER AND HE COULD NOT DO IT
SO THEY SAILED AND THEY SAILED AND THEY SAILED AND AT LENGTH
YOU CAN THINK WHAT A JOYFUL MEETING THAT WAS SOON AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR ALL THE KNIGHTS AND PRINCES IN THE KINGDOM WERE SUMMONED TO THE WEDDING AND THE PRINCESS WORE A DRESS THAT SHONE LIKE THE SUN SO THAT NO ONE HAD EVER BEHELD A MORE GORGEOUS SIGHT
NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE FARMER I WOULD ONLY REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JACKALS GATHERED TO DAY TO TRY AND CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KINGDOM EVERY CITY HAS SENT THEM AND THEY WAIT HUNGRY AND EAGER BUT DO NOT O KING MISTAKE OR PRETEND AGAIN
WELL THEN ANSWERED THE DUCK WHILST WE ARE CARRYING YOU THROUGH THE AIR
AND SO IT WILL NOT FLY STRAIGHT BUT DORANI DECLARED THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD TO HIM AND SHE COULDN'T THINK WHY THE STOOL FLEW AS IF WEIGHED DOWN AT ONE SIDE THE FAIRY STILL LOOKED DOUBTFUL
AT THAT SHE ROSE AND THREW HERSELF WEEPING INTO HIS ARMS WHISPERING GENTLY NEVER AGAIN MY LORD NEVER AGAIN WOULD I LEAVE THEE
BUT THE PRINCESS WISHED SO MUCH FOR IT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE TO REFUSE I AM LONELY FATHER SHE SAID AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS YOU GIVE ME CANNOT MAKE UP TO ME FOR THE LOSS OF MY MOTHER IF THIS LADY COMES TO LIVE HERE
TILL ITS FELLOW WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE JEW AND THE BOY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES SAID WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO FIND THE OTHER ONE BUT AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO USE IN DISPUTING THE DECISION
THAT NIGHT THE ARAB STOLE DOWN TO THE SHORE TO WATCH BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE RUBBED HIMSELF ALL OVER WITH SOME OIL WHICH MADE HIS SKIN SMART SO BADLY THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO SLEEP AS THE SOLDIERS HAD DONE THEN HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE ROCK AND WAITED
BUT I HAVE RECEIVED A SUMMONS AND I DARE NOT DISOBEY IT THE KING WAS SILENT TRYING TO CHOKE DOWN THE GRIEF HE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WELL
DRAWING ON HER GLOVES AND BUTTONING HER PRETTY JACKET CLOSE UP TO HER BEAUTIFUL SLENDER DUSKY THROAT DENIS TOOK HIS HAT AND ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE FOOTMAN THIS TIME BUT AFTER ASSISTING HER TO GET IN CLOSED THE DOOR HIMSELF
YES MY LOVE MISS ELIZABETH PROCEEDED AND FOR THAT REASON I WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO FIND THAT PRISCILLA WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HER PRISCILLA AND I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TOGETHER IN OUR QUIET WAY SHE HAS BEEN THE BEST OF DEAR GOOD GIRLS TO ME
AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE A SUBJECT UPON WHICH I WISH TO ASK YOUR UNBIASED OPINION MY DEAR THEODORA BEFORE I SAY GOOD BYE WHEN A MAN FINDS HIMSELF IN A DANGER WITH WHICH HE CANNOT COMBAT AND REMAIN HUMAN
OGLETHORPE JUNIOR WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT OGLETHORPE SENIOR HAD BEEN AND NOTWITHSTANDING HER PRACTICAL VIEWS LADY THROCKMORTON LIKED HIM NONE THE WORSE FOR IT SHE PETTED AND PATRONIZED HIM QUESTIONED AND ADVISED HIM AND IF HE DID NOT PLEASE HER
MISS PRISCILLA GOWER IS THE YOUNG LADY TO WHOM I AM TO BE MARRIED NEXT JULY DID YOU KNOW THAT YES ANSWERED THEO LOOKING ACTUALLY PLEASED AND BLUSHING BEAUTIFULLY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER BUT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR TELLING ME MISTER OGLETHORPE
HE SAW SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS IN A DAY'S ROUND AND HE WAS SO OFTEN TOO BUSY TO NOTICE HALF OF THEM THOUGH HE WAS AN ADMIRER OF PRETTY GIRLS THAT IT WAS NOTHING NEW TO SEE ONE AND FORGET HER UNTIL CHANCE THREW THEM TOGETHER AGAIN OF COURSE
HE WAS QUITE GLAD TO FIND THE GIRL SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED SO MODEST IN A SWEET WAY IT WAS EASY AS WELL AS PROPER ENOUGH TO TALK TO HER UNCEREMONIOUSLY WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF BEING DIFFUSE AND COMPLIMENTARY SO HE MADE HIMSELF AGREEABLE
I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FINE SPEECH TO THEODORA HE SAID TO LADY THROCKMORTON WHEN SHE CAME IN AND SHE DOES NOT COMPREHEND IT IN THE LEAST
THIS WAS A CURIOUS CONSOLATION THE TWO SPENT HOURS TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN THE TINY PARLOR STUMBLING OVER BERLIN WOOL DIFFICULTIES AND NOW AND THEN WANDERING TO AND FRO CONVERSATIONALLY FROM PRISCILLA TO THE OCTAGON STITCH AND FROM THE OCTAGON STITCH TO DENIS
AND APART FROM HIS RESPECT FOR HIS BETROTHED HE WAS VERY IMPATIENT OF INTERFERENCE WITH HIS AFFAIRS AND MY LADY WAS NOT CHARY OF INTERFERING WHEN THE FANCY SEIZED HER IT ROUSED HIS PRIDE TO THINK HOW LIBERALLY HE MUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND CONSEQUENTLY
THREE YEARS MORE WILL MAKE HER SOMETHING WONDERFUL AS FAR AS BEAUTY IS CONCERNED HE HAD SAID AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HAD FELT SOME SLIGHT PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION OF SEEING HER YET THEO HAD SOME FAINT MISGIVINGS DURING THE DAY
SHE THOUGHT OVER IT FOR A LONG TIME HER HANDSOME EYES BROODING OVER THE RED COALS BUT AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR SHE SPOKE OUT ALOUD TO THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM HE LOVED ME SHE SAID HE LOVED ME ME POOR PRISCILLA
RICHES ARE VERY DECEITFUL YOU KNOW BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOLID COMFORT IN A GENTEEL SUFFICIENCY TO ALL OF WHICH THEO ACQUIESCED MODESTLY INWARDLY WONDERING IF SHE WAS VERY WRONG IN WISHING THAT OGLETHORPE HAD NOT LEFT THEM QUITE SO EARLY
AND LISTENED QUIETLY TO HER WANDERING COMMENTS ANSWERING THEM AS BEST SHE COULD SHE HAD WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL SIR DUGALD'S BARBAROUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK SUPPER WAS OVER AND THEN SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM STIRRED THE FIRE AND DROPPED DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG TO THINK IT OVER
IT COOLED HIS ARDOR OF SELF EXAMINATION SOMEWHAT HIS DISCONTENT WAS MODIFIED BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN DOOR AND TOOK HIS LATCH KEY OUT OF HIS POCKET THE FACE THAT HAD LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM BENEATH THE LIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIR CASE
IF I HAD EVER LOVED ANY ONE AS PAMELA LOVED MISTER BRUNWALDE I SHOULD BE LIKE PAMELA SHE SAID I SHOULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE FROM THAT TIME SHE FANCIED THAT PRISCILLA GOWER LIKED HER BETTER THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AT ANY RATE SHE TOOK MORE NOTICE OF HER THOUGH SHE WAS NEVER EFFUSIVE OF COURSE
SHE GLANCED UP INTO HIS FACE BRIGHTLY SHE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT HIS LADY FRIEND
AND ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE FOR SOME PLACE WHOSE NAME HE DID NOT MENTION BUSINESS HAD CALLED HIM AWAY AND LADY THROCKMORTON OF COURSE KNEW WHAT SUCH BUSINESS WAS AND HOW IMPERATIVE ITS DEMANDS WERE HE MIGHT HAVE WAITED THEO SAID TO HERSELF
THEO'S IN GOINGS AND OUT GOINGS ARE SCARCELY OUR BUSINESS SO LONG AS SHE ENJOYS HERSELF SHE SAID PRESENT MY REGARDS TO THE MISS GOWERS MY DEAR AND SAY I REGRET THAT MY HEALTH DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU A POLITE FICTION BY THE WAY AS MY LADY WAS LOOKING HER BEST
SHE SAID SIMPLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DENIS'S INTRODUCTION THE QUIETNESS OF THIS GREETING SPEECH WAS A FAIR SAMPLE OF ALL HER MANNER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE EFFUSIVENESS FROM PRISCILLA GOWER
BLACK FRINGED AND LUSTROUS AS THEY WERE STILL WERE SILENT EYES THEY DID NOT SPEAK EVEN TO DENIS OGLETHORPE
AND AT SEVENTEEN ONE DOES NOT COMPREHEND THAT FATE CAN BE WHOLLY BITTER OR THAT SOME TURN IN FORTUNE IS NOT IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER HOPELESS THE PRESENT MAY SEEM IN THIS MOOD THE ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE LITTLE JOURNAL AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH CRIED A LITTLE HOPED A LITTLE
SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NEVER REACH HIM AT ALL AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS SHE EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST PASSIONATELY KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE LADY THROCKMORTON RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM REGRETTING HIS INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST
SAID MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE I WOULD NOT DISTURB HER ON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I KNOW SHE WILL BE DOWN DIRECTLY SHE NEVER READS LATE IN THE EVENING THIS IS A VERY HANDSOME DOG MISS NORTH VERY HANDSOME INDEED WAS THEO'S REPLY COME HERE SABRE
DO STAY MISS THEODORA AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THE OCTAGON STITCH AS I PROMISED THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU ADMIRED IT IN THAT ANTIMACASSAR I WAS MAKING FOR PRISCILLA MISS ELIZABETH'S CHIEF DELIGHT AND OCCUPATION WAS THE MAKING OF MIRACULOUSLY GORGEOUS MYSTERIES FOR PRISCILLA
BUT FREE FROM ANY TOUCH OF LIGHT GALLANTRY AS HIS MANNER TOWARD THE GIRL WAS DENIS OGLETHORPE DID NOT FORGET HER THIS NIGHT ON THE CONTRARY HE REMEMBERED HER VERY DISTINCTLY AND HAD IN HIS MIND A VERY EXACT MENTAL REPRESENTATION OF HER PURPLE ROBE
LADY THROCKMORTON IS UP STAIRS READING SHE EXPLAINED I WILL GO AND TELL HER YOU ARE HERE THERE WERE NO BELLS IN THE HOUSE AT DOWNPORT AND NO SERVANTS TO ANSWER IF ANY ONE HAD RANG ONE AND VERY NATURALLY THEO FORGOT SHE WAS NOT AT DOWNPORT EXCUSE ME NO
I HOPE OH I DO HOPE MISS PRISCILLA GOWER WILL LIKE ME HE HAD BEEN LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WHILE SHE SPOKE BUT THIS BROUGHT HIS EYES TO HERS AGAIN AND TO HER FACE BRIGHT APPEALING UPTURNED
ALL PRISCILLA'S SMILES WERE LIKE MOONLIGHT THEO'S HAD A DELICIOUS GLOW OF THE SUN YES SHE SAID IN HER PRACTICAL MANNER IT WILL PLEASE ME VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU MISS THEODORA COME AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN SPARE THE TIME
LADY THROCKMORTON WAS IN HER PRIVATE ROOM WHEN HE CAME AND AS HE MADE HIS ENTRANCE WITH AS LITTLE CEREMONY AS USUAL HE RAN IN UPON THEODORA NOW TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD UNTIL THIS MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT YOUNG PERSON'S VERY EXISTENCE
YOU ARE SEVENTEEN SAID PRISCILLA I KNEW AT SEVENTEEN THEO RECOVERED THE NEEDLE AND RESET IT IN HER WORK TO GIVE HERSELF TIME AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND FACED HER QUESTIONER BRAVELY IN A SORT OF DESPERATENESS IF I KNEW THAT I LOVED ANY ONE
MY LATE LAMENTED PARENTS MY DEAR SAID MISS ELIZABETH RUBBING HER SPECTACLES AND ADMIRINGLY REGARDING AN OWL LIKE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN AN AGGRESSIVE BROWN WIG AND AN EQUALLY OWL LIKE LADY IN A SELF ANNOUNCING FALSE FRONT EMBARRASSINGLY SUGGESTIVE OF MISS ELIZABETH'S OWN
AND RECEIPTED HIS MODEST BILLS ON THEIR WEEKLY PAYMENT PRISCILLA AT SEVENTEEN SILENT PRACTICAL GRAVE AND HANDSOME HAD PERHAPS SOFTENED UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS OFTEN PALE FACE HE WORKED SO HARD AND SO FAR INTO THE NIGHT
SHE WAS NOT WORLD WISE ENOUGH FOR THAT YET BUT SHE WAS QUITE EXHILARATING TO DAY SO GLAD TO BE OUT EVEN IN THE LONDON FOG OF NOVEMBER SO GLAD TO BE TAKEN LION HUNTING SO DELIGHTED WITH THE SHOPS AND THEIR GAY WINDOWS SO READY TO LET HER YOUNG TONGUE
OH SHE SAID AND THOUGH THE LITTLE EXCLAMATION WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN AN INDRAWN BREATH DENIS HEARD IT AND CAME OUT OF HIS CORNER TO TAKE A SEAT AT HER SIDE AND LEAN OVER THE BOX EDGE ALSO WHAT IS IT THEODORA HE ASKED IN A LOW CLEAR VOICE
THE TWO HAD ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SOME YEARS AGO WHEN DENIS HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS IN HIS PALMIEST DAYS IN FACT MY LADY HAD PICKED HIM UP WHEN HE STOOD IN SORE NEED OF FRIENDS AND OGLETHORPE NEVER FORGOT A FAVOR
INDEED I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO WHEN I MUST LOSE HER AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO WHEN SHE MARRIES MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE YES MA'AM ANSWERED THEO AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELT A CURIOUS STARTLED GLOW FLASH OVER HER
IT SEEMED SUCH A GREAT UNDERTAKING TO THEODORA THIS VOYAGE OF A FEW HOURS BUT LADY THROCKMORTON REGARDED IT AS THE LIGHTEST OF MATTERS TO HER IT WAS ONLY THE GIVING OF A FEW ORDERS BEING UNCOMFORTABLY SEA SICK FOR A WHILE AND THEN LANDING IN CALAIS
AND FINDING HIMSELF FACING THEODORA NORTH IN ROSE COLORED SATIN WAS A LITTLE LIKE ELECTRICITY OH IT'S THEODORA IS IT HE SAID SLOWLY WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF THANK YOU THEODORA WHAT FOR ASKED THEO BLUSHING
THAT THEODORA NORTH WAS NEARLY A WOMAN BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM NOW WITH ALL THE GREATER FORCE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN SO OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT BEFORE HE SAT BY HER SIDE UNTIL THE CURTAIN FELL BUT HIS SILENT MOOD SEEMED TO HAVE COME UPON HIM AGAIN
WHOSE PERFORMANCES UPON THE FLUTE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF WINNING HER AFFECTIONS BUT HAD UNHAPPILY RESULTED IN HIS CONTRACTING A FATAL COLD WHILE SERENADING ON A DAMP EVENING HE USED TO PLAY IN A COTTAGE NEAR A WOOD MY DEAR MOST BEAUTIFULLY SAID MISS ELIZABETH WILD WITH PATHOS
HE DID NOT EVEN OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR HIMSELF BUT WAITED FOR THE FOOTMAN TO DO IT PRISCILLA WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU HE SAID QUIETLY I WILL GO INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN WITH YOU THE DWARFED SITTING ROOM LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IT HAD LOOKED ON THEO'S FIRST INTRODUCTION TO IT
THIS IS A NOTIFICATION FROM THE PRINCE TO THE ABBOT OF YORK SAYING THAT HIS EMISSARIES HAVE SOUNDED YOU AND THAT YOU ARE READY WITH YOUR MEN TO STRIKE FOR HIM I HAVE SAID SO MUCH COMMENTED WILL NAMING THREE CONDITIONS THEY ARE WRITTEN HEREIN FIRST
THE CROWD SWAYED AND ROARED AND A SMALL DISTURBANCE BROKE OUT ON THE RIGHT OF THE SHERIFF AT ONCE THE SOLDIERS HURRIED TO QUELL IT AS THE PRISONER NEARED THE GALLOWS THE CROWD SO BORE UPON THE CART IN WHICH
FOR HE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEAVE THE DAME UNPROTECTED
AND SHALL BE FORCED TO QUIT MY CONSCIENCE WITH THE PRINCE WHEN I RETURN TO NOTTINGHAM WHEREFORE SEEING THAT YOUR APPOINTMENT TO LOCKSLEY STILL LACKS HIS CONFIRMATION
THE LANDS OF BROADWEALD IN LANCASHIRE TO HOLD IN HER OWN RIGHT FOR EVER THUS YOU SHALL HAVE WEALTH TO SHARE WITH YOUR ROBIN AND I COUNSEL YOU BOTH TO MAKE GOOD USE OF YOUR DAYS
EAGERLY SEND FORD OR ONE OF THE SCULLIONS FROM OUR KITCHEN THAT THEY MAY KNOW OUR CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND BID THE YOUNG ARCHER TO US HERE
MASTER FORD SMILED VERY SUPERIOR TO THESE BRAVE WORDS DEATH MASTER ROBIN IS A THING A LONG WAY OFF FROM US BOTH I DO CONCEIVE SAID HE THEREFORE IS THERE SMALL VALIANCE IN YOUR PRATING SO LIGHTLY OF IT
IN ORDER THAT THE QUESTION OF HIS APPOINTMENT TO A POST IN THE KING'S FORESTERS MIGHT BE WEIGHED AND CONSIDERED AS FOR THE RANGERSHIP OF LOCKSLEY THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO ONE MASTER JOHN FORD
CARFAX AND THE SHERIFF WERE CLOSE AT HAND WITH THEIR MEN FURIOUS AND DETERMINED EVEN AS THE LAST OF ROBIN'S MEN GAINED AND FELL OVER THE BRIDGE
AND LITTLE JOHN SHE ALLOWED THEM TO THRUST HER IGNOMINIOUSLY FORTH AT THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH SHE TURNED ONCE AS THOUGH TO RENEW HER PREPOSTEROUS CHARGES BUT CONTENTED HERSELF MERELY
SAID WARRENTON SCRATCHING HIS HEAD NOW TELL US WHOM YOU SAW AND HOW YOU CONTRIVED TO SPLIT THE NORMAN'S ARROW HE HAD ALREADY HEARD THE STORY BUT WAS VERY FAIN TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN IT IS A TRICK THAT I TAUGHT HIM DAME HE ADDED OFF HANDEDLY TO MISTRESS FITZOOTH
WAS NONE OTHER INDEED THAN THE VERY ROUGHBEARD FROM WHOM YOUNG ROBIN SO CLEVERLY DID SNATCH MY ARROW OF GOLD NAY NAY I THINK THE EVIDENCE POINTS VERY STRONGLY AGAINST FITZOOTH YET SINCE HE IS YOUR NEPHEW
GEOFFREY AND AIMEE NO LONGER OF ARAGON WERE JOINED TOGETHER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THE BISHOP PRONOUNCED A BLESSING AND FORGETTING HIMSELF UTTERLY IN THE EMOTION OF THE MOMENT
HE TOLD ME THAT THE SCARLET KNIGHT HAD GONE TO FRANCE WARRENTON LOOKED WISE THAT IS NOT WORTHY OF BELIEF EXCELLENCE SAID HE CUNNINGLY PRINCE JOHN IS NEAR AND ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THAT GEOFFREY OF MONTFICHET GEOFFREY OF MONTFICHET
RETURNED SUDDENLY TO NOTTINGHAM FROM LONDON BEARING NEWS TO THE SHERIFF THAT HE WAS TO PREPARE THE TOWN AT ONCE FOR A VISIT FROM THE YOUNG PRINCE JOHN
AND HELD OUT HIS STRONG HAND TO HELP THE BRIDES FROM OFF THEIR MILK WHITE MARES THE WHOLE PLACE BECAME ALIVE WITH EXCITEMENT AND RAPTURE LITTLE MAIDS WITH BASKETS OF VIOLETS AND PRIMROSES
THE STOCKS SHE ADDED VINDICTIVELY WILL YOU REPLY TO THOSE SCROLLS THEN CHILD SAID THE SHERIFF GLAD TO BE RELIEVED OF A TASK WHICH HE DID NOT RELISH
AGAIN AND AGAIN ROBIN'S HORN SOUNDED
FORWARD FRIENDS QUICK MARCH THEY RATTLED OFF AT A SMART PACE ROBIN MOUNTED BEHIND THE GOOD NATURED MUCH AND STUTELEY UPON THE CAPTAIN'S HORSE THE MILLER TOLD ROBIN CONFIDENTIALLY A FULL SCORE OF TIMES THAT HE MUCH
POCKETS IT IN ADVANCE IS HE A FAIR BOWMAN THIS HUBERT I KNOW BUT ONE ARCHER BETTER THAN HE LORDING YOURSELF AND I HAVE SEEN THE FINEST ARCHERY IN THE WORLD YOU TALK HEEDLESSLY WARRENTON SAID ROBIN REBUKING HIM
FOLLOW FOLLOW SHE CRIED WITH FLASHING EYES THERE IS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST ROBIN SAW THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH NOW IN ANY CASE TO THE WEST GATE HE CALLED LOCKSLEY A LOCKSLEY IT WAS THE OLD BATTLE CRY AND ONLY A FEW OF THEM REMEMBERED IT
YOU KNOW HOW FAIR A SPOT IT IS AND HOW SWEET THE SKY OF FRANCE HELP HER TO ADMINISTER HER RICHES GEOFFREY WISELY AND WELL
THE OUTLAW HANDED HIM THE SCROLL AND ALL WAITED IN SILENCE WHILST ROBIN DECIPHERED IT CARFAX SNAPPED HIS TEETH TOGETHER IN VEXATION AT THIS UNEXPECTED TURN HE CANNOT READ THE PARCHMENT IS IT LIKELY HE CRIED
FULL RANK AS BARON OF THE REALM WITH POWER TO SPEAK AND VOTE IN THE UPPER COURT OF APPEAL THE HIGHEST RANK IN THE LAND NEXT TO THE KING HIMSELF SIR RICHARD OF THE LEE AND HIS SON
TAKE BACK YOUR MEN AND YOURSELF BE CONTENT WITH THE CAPTAINCY OF THE FORESTERS OF SHERWOOD THIS PART OF THE FOREST WILL BE ADMINISTERED UNDER THE KING'S PLEASURE BY ME WHAT IF I COULD SHOW YOU THE KING'S DISMISSAL OF YOUR FATHER SNARLED THE OTHER
SO BRAVELY AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM ROBIN SPOKE TO THE OLD MAN SIR HE SAID I HAVE IT IN ME TO SPEAK PLAIN WORDS WITH YOU AND I MAY HAVE NO FEAR BOY I AM ONE WHO LOVES AN OPEN MIND MONTFICHET SPOKE WITH MEANING WELL SIR
RACED THROUGH AND OVER THE BROKEN BRIDGE AND ALLAN FOLLOWED NEXT THE OUTLAWS WERE SOON FREE OF THE TOWN AND ONCE MORE IN THEIR OWN ELEMENT BUT LITTLE JOHN MUST NEEDS GO BACK TO COVER THE RETREAT WITH STUTELEY
I KNOW NOTHING BEYOND THAT WE DID BIND MY COUSIN'S ARMOR ABOUT WITH RED RIBBON REPLIED ROBIN UNEASILY HE REMEMBERED THE CLERK'S WARNING AND A PRESENTIMENT OF COMING EVIL PRICKED HIM
SPLIT DOWN ON EITHER SIDE OF IT FLUSH TO THE VERY FACE OF THE MARK ROBIN HIMSELF COULD SCARCELY CREDIT HIS OWN SUCCESS
BUT THE BEGGAR WAS VERY WILLING TO KEEP NEAR TO THE SHERIFF AND ASKED VERY HUMBLY THAT HE MIGHT BE GIVEN A PLACE IN MONCEUX'S HOUSEHOLD INSTEAD OF TAKING THIS HORSE WHICH WAS OF SMALL USE TO ONE OF HIS TRADE I WILL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER SAID MONCEUX ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE CAPTAINCY OF MY ARCHERS
THERE IS NO NEED FOR DEFENCE SPOKE THE KING THE CHARGE IS TOO WILD AND FOOLISH AN ONE SEIZE THIS WOMAN SOME OF YOU AND TAKE HER WITHOUT
AND NOW HE COULD NOTCH WARRENTON'S SHAFT AT ONE HUNDRED PACES A FEAT DIFFICULT IN THE EXTREME THE OLD RETAINER TOOK HUGE DELIGHT IN TRAINING THE LAD I DO HEAR OF A BRAVE BUSINESS IN ARCHERY TO BE DONE IN SHERWOOD FOREST HE SAID
FOR THE RANGERSHIP HAS COME TO ME THROUGH NO SEEKING OF MINE OWN THE QUARREL IF THERE BE ONE IS BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MASTER MONCEUX AND IN REASON YOU SHOULD LET ME INTO POSSESSION HERE AND TAKE YOUR ANGER TO NOTTINGHAM I SPEAK TO THE SHERIFF IN THAT I SPEAK TO YOU JOHN FORD RETORTED THE LAD
HER DRESS FASTENED ALL AWRY FOLKS LOOKED ONCE AT HER AND THEN EXCHANGED GLANCES BETWEEN THEMSELVES STAY THIS MOCKERY OF MARRIAGE MY LORD SHE CRIED
TURNING TO LEAVE THEM GO YOUR WAYS LOCKSLEY AND WIN THE PURSE IS THERE NO TOLL ENQUIRED ROBIN SMILING AGAIN AM I TRULY FREE OF SHERWOOD WILL
TO THE TWO BRIDEGROOMS THE NEWLY MADE EARLS OF NOTTINGHAM AND HUNTINGDON WITH ROBIN AND GEOFFREY WERE FIRSTLY OLD GEORGE OF GAMEWELL
HE TURNED TO HIS MEN NOW COMRADES CRIED HE HAVE YOU SEARCHED OUR PRISONERS AND PREPARED THEM TIS WELL ARE THEY BOUND TOGETHER THEN BY THE ARMS TWOS AND THREES AS IS APPOINTED IN OUR RULES AND IS THE RIGHT LEG AND LEFT LEG OF EACH VILLAIN SHACKLED TOGETHER
THEY ALL SAT TO A GREAT FEAST LITTLE JOHN WAS ALREADY SO MUCH RECOVERED OF HIS WOUND AS TO SING THEM A SONG
NOR I I SHALL NEVER FORGET CRIED HE IMPULSIVELY YOUR EYES ARE ALWAYS IN MY MEMORY
THERE ARE NO TARGETS SUCH AS YOUR SHAFTS MIGHT REACH
AND THE TRUMPETERS AND HERALDS MADE MUSIC FOR THEM THEY RETURNED THROUGH THE STREETS OF NOTTINGHAM GAY NOW WITH FLAGS AND MERRY WITH A JOYFUL POPULACE LOUD CHEERINGS RENT THE AIR
FOR SURE I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PRIZE EVEN AS I TOLD YOU HAD NOT HUBERT ALREADY MADE OFF WITH IT IS THIS SO ASKED ROBIN DOUBTFULLY LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE LINCOLN MEN THOSE IN FRONT HAD NOW STOPPED ALSO
HAD HE FORGIVEN ROBIN AND HIS MEN THE HOUR WAS REACHED AND AT ONCE A SMALL COMPANY WAS SEEN ISSUING FORTH FROM NOTTINGHAM CASTLE AGAINST HIS WILL MASTER MONCEUX HAD GIVEN USE OF THE CASTLE
HE STOOD UPRIGHT THAT PROGRESS FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS OUT OF ALL QUESTION ANOTHER DISTURBANCE BROKE OUT IN THE REAR OF THE PROCESSION NEXT INSTANT THE PRISONER WAS SEEN TO HAVE FREE HANDS HE STOOPED AND SLICED THE CORDS ABOUT HIS FEET
INTERPOSED STUTELEY AFRAID THAT CARFAX WAS GOING TO TURN THE TABLES ON THEM IN SOME TREACHEROUS WAY HE IS A VERY PROPER ROGUE
AND LIKE NAT HE BEGAN TO BE DISDAINFUL OF THE REST AND TO SWAGGER IT SOMEWHAT EACH TIME HIS TURN TO SHOOT CAME ROUND THE PRIZE WILL SURELY BE THINE ARTHUR A BLAND CRIED MONCEUX LOUDLY CLAPPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER AFTER THIS FELLOW HAD MADE A FAIR SHOT
EIGHTY FOUR STEPS LONG OR ABOUT
AND OH WHAT AN APPETITE WE WOULD HAVE AND HOW BRIGHT THE FIRE WOULD BE
TO A HISTORIC GRAVE TWO MILES OUT FROM THE TOWN AND ON THE RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAY IN THIS GRAVE LIES A PIONEER MOTHER WHO DIED AUGUST FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO NEARLY SIX WEEKS AFTER I HAD PASSED OVER THE GROUND
AND AT NIGHTFALL DROVE INTO A STABLE PUT THE OXEN IN THE STALLS AND AS USUAL THE DOG JIM IN THE WAGON THE NEXT MORNING JIM WAS GONE THE STABLEMAN SAID HE HAD LEFT THE WAGON A FEW MOMENTS AFTER I HAD AND HAD BEEN STOLEN
FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
FOR WHICH THEY WOULD PAY ME NO NOT FOR PAY I SAID BUT I WILL GO SO THERE WAS QUITE A REALISTIC SHOW IN THE RING THAT AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND THE HOSPITAL RECEIVED MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS BENEFIT
BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
AND WE FELT THANKFUL FOR THEM AND SORRY FOR SOME NEIGHBORS CHILDREN WHO HAD TO GO BAREFOOTED EVEN IN QUITE COLD WEATHER CARRIE ONCE HAD A PAIR OF NICE WHITE SHOES
SUCH IS THE RECORD IN MY JOURNAL OF THIS NOBLE ANIMAL'S DEATH I THINK HE DIED FROM EATING SOME POISONOUS PLANT WHEN WE STARTED
OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
CALLED HIS MAN OFF AND ORDERED MY DRIVER RELEASED IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS AN ORDINANCE AGAINST ALLOWING CATTLE TO BE DRIVEN ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK OF COURSE THIS WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO LOOSE CATTLE
FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
THE MAYOR WAS ABSENT AND THE ACTING MAYOR COULD NOT SIGN AN ORDINANCE UNTIL AFTER TEN DAYS HAD ELAPSED THE CITY ATTORNEY CAME IN AND SAID THE ALDERMEN HAD EXCEEDED THEIR AUTHORITY AS THEY COULD NOT LEGALLY GRANT A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
CHAPTER TWENTY SIX REVIVING OLD MEMORIES OF THE TRAIL THE SIGHT OF SWEETWATER RIVER TWENTY MILES OUT FROM SOUTH PASS REVIVED MANY PLEASANT MEMORIES AND SOME THAT WERE SAD
RICH FIELDS OF GRAIN AND HAY AND BEETS COVER THE VALLEY GREAT SUGAR FACTORIES RAILROADS BUSINESS BLOCKS AND FINE HOMES TELL OF THE PROSPERITY THAT HAS LEAPED OUT OF THE PARCHED PLAINS WE TRAILED ACROSS
THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
INSTEAD OF THE PARCHED PLAIN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WITH ITS FIERCE CLOUDS OF DUST ROLLING UP THE VALLEY AND ENGULFING WHOLE TRAINS WE SAW A LANDSCAPE OF SMILING FRUITFUL FIELDS INVITING GROVES OF TREES AND CONTENTED HOMES FROM GRAND ISLAND I WENT TO FREMONT NEBRASKA
UNDER THE HAMMER AT SHERIFF'S SALE AT THAT TIME I HAD ADVANCED TO MY NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS UPON THEIR HOP CROPS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS LOST THESE PEOPLE SIMPLY COULD NOT PAY
I LEFT THE RIVER WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS IN MY POCKET ALL BUT TWO DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS OF THIS WAS GONE BEFORE I ARRIVED IN PORTLAND BUT WE COULD NOT DELAY LONGER EVEN TO MAKE MONEY
FINALLY THE RAILROAD SURVEYORS CAME ALONG THEY MIGHT HAVE RUN THE TRACK OVER THE LONELY GRAVE BUT FOR THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF THE MAN WHO WIELDED THE COMPASS HE CHANGED THE LINE
THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
OTHER THAN A SCANT SUPPLY OF BERRIES AND VEGETABLE GROWTH AND
ALREADY I HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT A CORN DOCTOR OR ANY KIND OF DOCTOR THAT I DID NOT HAVE PATENT MEDICINE TO SELL AND THAT I WAS NOT SOLICITING CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE EXPEDITION
ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
AND SOME EVEN LOST THEIR LIVES AFTER TERRIBLE HARDSHIPS THE SURVIVORS REACHED THE ROAD AGAIN TO BECOME OBJECTS OF CHARITY I KNEW ONE SURVIVOR WHO WAS OUT SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT FOOD
WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE NUMBER OF BIG FLIES THAT RAN THE CATTLE NEARLY WILD I STOOD ON THE WAGON TONGUE FOR MILES TO REACH THEM WITH THE WHIPSTOCK THE CATTLE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE DID NOT STOP AT NOON BUT DROVE ON
BUT NO WILD ANIMALS EVER HARMED US AND WE DID NOT DIE FOR WANT OF FOOD CLOTHING OR SHELTER ALTHOUGH WE DID HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WERE TRYING
WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
AND IF POSSIBLE DRIVE BACK HOME THE SAME DAY IF NOT ABLE TO DO THIS WE CAMPED ON THE ROAD AGAIN BUT IF THE NIGHT WAS NOT TOO DARK WE WOULD REACH HOME THAT NIGHT
FOR THE MOST PART I RECEIVED A WARM WELCOME ALL ALONG THE ROUTE DAYTON TREATED ME GENEROUSLY MAYOR BADGER OF COLUMBUS WROTE GIVING ME THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY AND MAYOR TOM JOHNSON WROTE TO HIS CHIEF OF POLICE TO
IN FACT THE OX IS NOT SO DUMB AS A CASUAL OBSERVER MIGHT THINK DAVE AND DANDY KNEW ME AS FAR AS THEY COULD SEE SOMETIMES WHEN I WENT TO THEM IN THE MORNING DAVE WOULD LIFT HIS HEAD BOW HIS NECK STRETCH OUT HIS BODY AND PERHAPS EXTEND A FOOT AS IF TO SAY
WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
THE COMFORT AND PLENTY WE HAD HOPED AND STRUGGLED FOR WAS ATTAINED NEXT CAME A DEVELOPMENT IN THE FAMILY FORTUNES THAT WE HAD NOT DREAMED OF NEVER HAD WE THOUGHT TO SEE THE MEEKER FAMILY CONDUCTING A BUSINESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LONDON OFFICE
MY BOOTS WERE SOMEWHAT THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND MY OLD FASHIONED CLOTHES UNDERSTOOD WELL ENOUGH BY PIONEERS ALONG THE TRAIL WERE DILAPIDATED I WAS NOT THE MOST PRESENTABLE SPECIMEN FOR EVERY SORT OF COMPANY
NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
WE FOUND THAT SOME EMIGRANTS HAD CALKED TWO WAGON BEDS AND LASHED THEM TOGETHER AND WERE USING THIS CRAFT FOR CROSSING BUT THEY WOULD NOT HELP OTHERS ACROSS FOR LESS THAN THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS A WAGON
HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
MARDEN PICKED UP THE RIFLE TO SHOW FIGHT AND CALLED ON THE DOG JIM TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MEN AS HE RAISED THE GUN TO USE IT AS A CLUB ONE OF THE BOATMEN THREW UP HIS HANDS BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE DON'T SHOOT DON'T SHOOT
MISSUS JONES REMEMBERS THE KAPPA KAPPA AND SAYS LITTLE OR NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE HEARTILY DISSENTS FROM HER FRIEND AND STILL HOPES THAT THERE MAY BE A GOOD TIME COMING
PRETENDS TO DISBELIEVE THAT IT IS THE SAME HOUSE ONE OF THE EVENTS IN MARY'S LIFE WHICH ASTONISHES HER MOST IS THE PERFECT FRIENDSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN HER AND HER ELDEST SISTER IN LAW
ONLY I THOUGHT I KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT WHAT DID I THINK THAT I WAS A HEARTLESS SCOUNDREL NO NEVER IF I HAD I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAVE CARED ABOUT IT
THE BARONESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT VISITORS AT A COUNTRY HOUSE IN ENGLAND COULD NOT BE MADE TO ENDURE SUCH AN INFLICTION BUT SHE SUCCEEDED IN LEVYING A CONTRIBUTION FROM MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES AND THERE WERE RUMOURS AFLOAT THAT SHE GOT A SOVEREIGN OUT OF MISTER HOUGHTON
ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS AT LARGE SHE COULD TEACH LESSONS INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING THAT HAD COME FROM THAT IMPUDENT BUT IMBECILE AMERICAN
SHE'S NOT HALF SO MUCH MY COUSIN AS YOU ARE MY FRIEND IF I MAY SAY SO
AND SO GEORGE WANTED TO MARRY YOU WAS HE VERY MUCH IN LOVE I WAS BOUND TO SUPPOSE SO MY LORD AND YOU DIDN'T CARE FOR HIM I DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT I CERTAINLY DID NOT CARE TO SET UP HOUSEKEEPING WITHOUT A HOUSE OR WITHOUT THE MONEY TO GET ONE
IT MAY BE PLAY TO YOU BUT IT'S DEATH TO ME HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT SHE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST SHE WAS NOT WEEPING BUT THERE WAS A DRAWN HEAVY LOOK ABOUT HER FACE WHICH IN TRUTH TOUCHED HIS HEART
HIS PECULIAR PROPENSITIES AND HIS WEALTH SHE CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE HERSELF IT WAS HOWEVER SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS WHO WAS A BACHELOR AND VERY RICH HAD TAKEN HER BY THE HAND
GOD BLESS MY SOUL THAT'S GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING YOU ARE HEARTLESS ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS IT HAS COME TO THAT WITH YOU
THE LADIES SUSANNA AND AMELIA ALSO COME UP TO TOWN EVERY YEAR VERY GREATLY TO THEIR SATISFACTION AND ARE MOST DEVOTED TO THE YOUNG MARCHIONESS
AT ANY RATE SHE WAS RESOLVED TO SEEK REDRESS AT LAW AND AT LAST HAD BEEN ADVISED TO PROCEED CONJOINTLY AGAINST AUNT JU LADY SELINA PROTEST AND THE BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN
IN WHICH MESSENGERS FROM THE QUEEN'S JUDGES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND HER AND SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BEAR THE JOURNEY WITHOUT INJURY BUT THEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF A BABY PERHAPS OF A POPENJOY SO BORN
AND HE WILL MAKE IT STRAIGHT FOR US YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT AT ALL THOSE WOMEN AT MANOR CROSS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER LORD GEORGE CAME AND WAS VERY ANGRY
YOU AND I GUSS HAVE MADE A MISTAKE FROM THE BEGINNING BEING POOR PEOPLE WE HAVE LIVED AS THOUGH WE WERE RICH I HAVE NEVER DONE SO OH YES YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF DINING OUT IN FITZROY SQUARE AND DRINKING TEA IN TAVISTOCK PLACE
BUT IT'S SO SAD ABOUT THE LITTLE BOY
HE'S THE DEPUTY BISHOP OF THE DIOCESE BUT WHY HAVE THE BISHOP HIMSELF UNLESS HE HAPPEN TO BE A FRIEND DOES YOUR DAUGHTER LIKE HER MARRIAGE I HOPE SO SHE DOES NOT COMPLAIN HE'S AN AWFUL ASS AND ALWAYS WAS
IF YOU WILL NOT SAY SO MUCH AS THAT TO ME YOU MUST BE FALSE INDEED WHEN YOU HAVE THE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WILL YOU MARRY ME OH CERTAINLY AND YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT SUCH A MATTER WHEN I AM POURING OUT MY VERY SOUL TO YOU
AT LAST SHE MADE THE OPPORTUNITY CALLING UPON HIM TO WALK WITH HER ONE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN ALL OTHER FOLK WERE IN CHURCH OR PERHAPS IN BED NO I WON'T GO TO CHURCH SHE HAD SAID TO AUNT JU
THAN YOU ARE IF IT WERE ALL WELL BETWEEN US AND HE HAD THE PROPERTY SHOULD I SCRUPLE TO GO AND STAY AT MANOR CROSS YOU WOULD STILL HAVE YOUR OWN HOUSE TO GO BACK TO SO WILL HE
SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SAID JACK WHY THE DEVIL SHE SHOULD HAVE MARRIED GEORGE I CAN'T THINK SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR HIM THE LEAST DON'T YOU THINK SHE DOES I'M SURE SHE DON'T
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT ANY EVIL THING SPOKEN OF HER HAD BEEN SHEER SLANDER AND YET HE HAD MANAGED TO TELL HER EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF WITHOUT SUBJECTING HIMSELF TO HER UNDYING ANGER WHEN SHE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM
AND HAD NOW DONE HIS WORK LOOKED AT IN ANY LIGHT THE THING WAS VERY TERRIBLE LORD GEORGE MIGHT PROBABLY EVEN YET BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER TO SOME OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CONTINENT
WHEN THE MONTH WAS OVER HE DID GO UP TO TOWN AND SAW MISTER KNOX MISTER KNOX ADVISED HIM TO GO BACK TO MANOR CROSS DECLARING THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS WITHOUT FURTHER ORDERS
SHE MIGHT LOSE IT BUT SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND BURIED HER FACE UPON HIS BOSOM AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING HIM SHE WAS VERY SOLEMN IN HER MANNER TO HIM I WILL SAY GOOD BYE NOW JACK
BUT AS HE WENT TO THE STATION HE REFLECTED THAT OLIVIA GREEN WAS A VERY NICE GIRL IF THOSE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WERE TRUE THEY WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM HIS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS BOTHERING HIM TO GET MARRIED
IF MY WIFE WOULD DIE AND HE WOULD DIE WE MIGHT GET UP ANOTHER MATCH AND CUT OUT LORD GEORGE AFTER ALL THIS SPECULATION WAS TOO DEEP EVEN FOR MISTER DE BARON WHO LAUGHED AND SHUFFLED HIMSELF ABOUT AND GOT OUT OF THE ROOM WOULDN'T YOU HAVE LIKED TO BE A MARCHIONESS HE SAID SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS TO MISSUS HOUGHTON
I REALLY THINK HE IS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE BEHAVES QUITE PRETTILY
I GOT HIM TO TELL ME THAT HE'D SEEN YOU AT BROTHERTON AND THEN HE TALKED A DEAL OF NONSENSE ABOUT THE GOOD YOU'D DO WHEN YOU WERE MARCHIONESS
THE YOUNGEST OF HIS THREE CHILDREN IS OLDER THAN LADY MARY BUT WHEN HE DOES THIS AT HOME HIS EARS ARE ALWAYS BOXED FOR HIM OF MISTER GROSCHUT IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT HE IS STILL AT PUGSTY
VERY INTERESTING BUT I DON'T THINK I'M WELL ENOUGH MYSELF HERE IS CAPTAIN DE BARON A YOUNG MAN AS STRONG AS A HORSE AND VERY FOND OF WOMEN HE'LL SIT IT OUT I BEG YOUR PARDON WHAT IS IT
JACK WAS OF COURSE QUITE WILLING TO SIT UNDER THE CEDAR TREE INSTEAD OF PLAYING CROQUET HE WAS PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER SHE WISHED IF HE COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT SUBJECTS SHE WOULD PREFER HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THEM AND NOTHING ELSE
I THINK HE HAS GIVEN ALL THAT UP NOT HE HE'LL HAVE TO UNLESS HE MEANS TO SPEND MORE MONEY THAN I THINK HE HAS GOT GEORGE IS QUITE SATISFIED ABOUT POPENJOY NOW SAID LADY ALICE I FANCY GEORGE DIDN'T LIKE THE EXPENSE
BUT JUST FOR THIS ONCE HE WAS OBLIGED TO DEVIATE INTO A LIE NEVER HE SAID OF COURSE IT IS NOT FOR ME TO ENQUIRE FURTHER
HE WOULD BE THE YOUNG MAN ENGAGED TO MARRY AUGUSTA MILDMAY AND THEN HE COULD HARDLY NOW REFUSE TO ANSWER THE LETTERS WHICH SHE WOULD BE SURE TO WRITE TO HIM AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK THERE HAD BEEN A PREVIOUS PERIOD OF LETTER WRITING
YOU CAN MAKE A JOKE OF IT WHEN IT IS ALL MY LIFE TO ME JACK IF YOU WILL SAY THAT IT SHALL HAPPEN SOME DAY SOME DAY I WILL BE HAPPY IF YOU WON'T I CAN ONLY DIE
THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT SHE COULD FORGIVE THEM FOR THE OLD QUARREL
YOUR FATHER HAS A RIGHT TO BE IN THE HOUSE IN LONDON
HE LAUGHED AND BADE HER BE OF GOOD CHEER AND TOLD HER THAT THERE WERE GOOD DAYS COMING THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR TOGETHER AND MARY WAS BECOMING UNHAPPY IF HER FATHER WERE ALLOWED TO GO WITHOUT SOME RECOGNITION FROM THE FAMILY
BUT AS WAS WELL KNOWN THE BISHOP NEVER WENT ANYWHERE EXCEPT TO CLERICAL HOUSES MISTER GROSCHUT WHO WAS A YOUNGER MAN KNEW THAT IT BEHOVED HIM TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN AND THAT HE COULD NOT BE EFFICACIOUS AMONG SINNERS UNLESS HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SEEN IN THEIR PATHS
THAT THE GOUT HAS NOT HAD A CHANCE OF GETTING INTO HIS STOMACH LORD GIBLET PROFESSES HIMSELF TO BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE HE HAS ALREADY FOUR CHILDREN HE LIVES IN A SMALL HOUSE IN GREEN STREET
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT LADY SARAH WITH CONSIDERABLE CIRCUMLOCUTION ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO THE MESSENGER THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE THE MAN COULD SIMPLY SAY THAT HE WAS ONLY A MESSENGER
SURELY A MAN MAY BUILD WHAT CASTLES IN THE AIR HE PLEASES IF HE WILL ONLY HOLD HIS TONGUE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM BUT SHE WAS SURE ALSO THAT HIS WAS THE PROPER WAY OF MAKING LOVE
THEN THEY HAD QUARRELLED WITH HER TOO NOW THEY HAD RECEIVED HER BACK INTO THEIR FAVOUR BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NONE OF THEIR FAVOURS UNLESS THEY WOULD TAKE HER FATHER WITH HER SHE WAS SITTING AT THE TIME IN THAT
SHE WAS RAPID AND ELOQUENT BUT NOT ALWAYS INTELLIGIBLE
WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS FAULTS HE WAS NOT A CRUEL MAN HE HAD DEFENDED HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE WHEN SHE HAD SEEMED TO ATTACK HIM BUT NOW HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE HER REQUEST IT AMOUNTED TO SO LITTLE
SO I WAS QUITE ANXIOUS
THE STAID OVERLANDERS WHO HAD RISKED THEIR LIVES TO REACH THIS WILD LAND OF DESIRE WHO HAD COME FROM SUCH CHURCH GOING HAMLETS AS WHITBY SUCH SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CENTRES AS TORONTO AND MONTREAL
HOW THE SNEAK THIEF TRAILED THE TENDERFOOT SOMEWHERE ELSE ALL OF IT ROMANCE MUCH OF IT FICTION MUCH OF IT FACT BUT NO FICTION HALF SO MARVELLOUS AS THE FACT BULL TEAMS OF TWENTY YOKES
DREAMING OF THE FORTUNES AWAITING THEM IN CARIBOO SOME NIGHTS WHEN THE CAPTAIN PERMITTED A LONGER HALT THAN USUAL AND WHEN CAMP FIRES BLAZED BEFORE THE TENTS MEN PLAYED THE VIOLIN AND SANG AND DANCED EACH MAN WAS HIS OWN COOK
WHEN WORD CAME OF THIS MURDER THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF YALE FORMED A RIFLE COMPANY OF FORTY WHICH IN AUGUST STARTED UP TO THE FORKS AT LYTTON AT SPUZZUM THERE WAS A FIGHT INDIANS BARRED THE WAY
JANUARY SETTLED DISORDER AMONG THE WHITES IN THE WILD REMOTE REGIONS OF THE UP COUNTRY THERE WAS MUCH CLAIM JUMPING A MAN LOST HIS CLAIM IF HE STOPPED MINING FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS
A COLONIAL LEGISLATURE WAS ELECTED AND MET AT VICTORIA IN AUGUST FOR THE FIRST TIME
WITHOUT WAITING FOR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY DOUGLAS ISSUED A ROYAL PROCLAMATION AGAINST THE SALE OF LIQUOR AND LEFT A MINING RECORDER TO REGISTER CLAIMS
FROM WASHINGTON WE HAD ROUGHED IT IN EAST AND WEST KOOTENAY AND WERE WORKING SOUTH TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY DEAD BROKE WE HAD FOUND FLOAT IN PLENTY AND HAD FOLLOWED IT UP RIDGES AND OVER DIVIDES ACROSS THREE RANGES OF MOUNTAINS
AND THERE THE FORCES WERE TRANSFERRED TO TOM WRIGHT'S STERN WHEELER THE ENTERPRISE BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT HOPE THE WHOLE AFFAIR LOOKED LIKE SEMI COMIC VAUDEVILLE
AND THE TRAPPER DID NOT LIKE TO HAVE HIS GAME PRESERVE OVERRUN BY FELLOWS WHO SCARED OFF ALL ANIMALS FROM TRAPS SET FIRE GOING TO CLEAR AWAY UNDERBRUSH AND OWNED RESPONSIBILITY TO NO AUTHORITY NO DOUBT THESE MEN WERE ARGONAUTS
THE SILENT SHAGGY RAGGED FIRST SCOUTS OF THE GOLD STAMPEDE WANDER HOUSELESS FOR YEARS FROM HILL TO HILL FROM GULLY TO GULLY UP RIVERS UP STREAM BEDS UP DRY WATERCOURSES
CARIBOO INDIAN UNREST WAS PROBABLY FIRST AMONG THE CAUSES WHICH LED THE MINERS TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES INTO LEAGUES FOR PROTECTION
RIVER BANK IS FOLLOWED WHERE POSSIBLE BUT WHERE WINDFALL OR PRECIPICE DRIVES BACK FROM THE BED OF THE RIVER OVER THE MOUNTAIN SPURS THE PATHFINDER TAKES HIS BEARINGS FROM COUNTLESS SIGNS MOSS IS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TREE TRUNKS
A JUDGE IN OUR COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND A DETACHMENT OF ROYAL ENGINEERS UNDER COMMAND OF COLONEL MOODY AT FORT LANGLEY ON NOVEMBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT THE COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA WAS PROCLAIMED UNDER THE LAWS OF ENGLAND
BUT SALT WAS A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND BUTTER A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE A POUND AND FLOUR RARER THAN NUGGETS
ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM END TO END TWO FEET ACROSS AND TWO DEEP THE SIDES CONVERGED TO BOTTOM AT THE HEAD WAS A PERFORATED SHEET IRON BOTTOM LIKE A HOUSEWIFE'S COLANDER INTO THIS BOX THE GRAVEL WAS SHOVELLED BY ONE MINER

HE HAD JUDGED IT TO BE TEN MILES AWAY BUT OUT FROM THE UPPER VALLEY IT CAME COILING LIKE A LONG WHITE SNAKE AND BEFORE HE COULD TURN IT HAD CAUGHT HIM IN A SLIDE DEATH WAS ALMOST CERTAIN
HE THINKS HIS PILE IS MADE AN HE'S GOIN HAME THIS FALL
OR WHETHER HE HUNG AS A SIGN OF WARNING FROM A POLE SET HORIZONTALLY AT A PROPER HEIGHT BETWEEN TWO TREES IN A MINING CAMP THERE IS NO MERCY FOR THE CROOK
ALL LIQUOR WHEREVER FOUND WAS ORDERED SPILLED
THE WARRANT WAS SENT AFTER HIM TO THE LOCAL PEACE OFFICER FOR EXECUTION BUT THIS OFFICER HAD ALREADY ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF THE NEGRO AT YALE SO THERE IT STOOD EACH FIGHTER MAKING COMPLAINT AGAINST THE OTHER
AMID THE DANCE HALLS AND SALOONS THE MINER WITH MONEY BECOMES A SOT OUT IN THE WILDS HE BECOMES A CHILD OF NATURE SIMPLE AND CLEAN AND ELEMENTAL AS THE TREES AROUND HIM OR THE STARS ABOVE HIM
UP STREAM THEN HEADED THE PROSPECTORS ON THE FRASER IN THAT AUTUMN OF FIFTY EIGHT THE MINER'S TRAIN OF PACK HORSES IS A STUDY IN NATURE THERE IS ALWAYS THE WISE OLD BELL MARE LEADING THE WAY
AND THUS GAVE THE GREAT GOLD AREA ITS NAME THE POPULATION OF YALE THAT WINTER CONSISTED OF SOME EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE HOUSED IN TENTS AND LOG SHACKS ROOFED WITH CANVAS BETWEEN YALE AND HOPE REMAINED TWO THOUSAND MINERS DURING THE WINTER
OF THE SEDGY WATER LILY GROWING WHERE WILD DUCK FLACKERED UNAFRAID GAME WAS SUPERABUNDANT PRAIRIE CHICKENS NESTLED ALONG THE SINGLE FILE TRAIL DEER BOUNDED FROM THE POPLAR THICKETS
AND DO JUST WHAT WE PLEASE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE INDIANS WE ARE AT PRESENT THE HIGHEST UP OF ANY WHITE MEN ON THE RIVER
WHEN THE INDIANS SAW THE COMPANY OF ARMED MEN UNDER SNYDER THEY FLED TO THE HILLS FLAGS OF TRUCE WERE DISPLAYED ON BOTH SIDES AND A PEACE WAS PATCHED UP TILL GOVERNOR DOUGLAS COULD COME UP FROM THE COAST
THERE IS ALWAYS THE LAZY PACKER THAT HAS TO BE NIPPED BY THE HORSE BEHIND HIM THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SHANKY COLTS WHO BOLT TO STAMPEDE WHERE THE TRAIL WIDENS BUT EVEN SHANKY LEGGED COLTS LEARN TO KEEP IN LINE IN THE WILDS AT EVERY STEEP ASCENT THE PACK TRAIN HALTS
THE CAMELS THEMSELVES COULD STAND NEITHER THE CLIMATE NOR THE HARD ROCK ROAD THEY WERE TURNED ADRIFT ON THE THOMPSON RIVER WHERE THE LAST OF THEM DIED IN NINETEEN O FIVE THERE WAS SOMETHING HIGHLY ROMANTIC IN THE STAGE COACH TRAVEL OF THIS HALCYON ERA
INSIDE WAS A DRAMA OF HUMAN NATURE TO OUTDO ANY CURTAIN RAISER HE HAD EVER WITNESSED A BARONET WHO HAD LOST IN THE GAME AND WAS GOING HOME PENNILESS PERHAPS EARNING HIS WAY BY HELPING WITH THE HORSES AN OUTWORN ACTRESS WHO HAD BEEN TRYING HER LUCK AT THE DANCE HALLS
WITH CARE CREEP UP FROM LANGLEY TO HOPE AND YALE AND THE FARES CHARGED AFFORDED A GOOD REVENUE TO THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY EVEN WHEN PROSPECTORS STRUCK ABOVE YALE
THE ARMY STAYED ONLY TO SEE THE MINERS WASH THE GOLD AND THEN PUT BACK TO VICTORIA THE MINERS HAD LEARNED THAT AN ENGLISH JUDGE AND A FIELD FORCE COULD BE PUT ON THE GROUND IN A WEEK SEPTEMBER HAD SETTLED DISORDER AMONG THE INDIANS
HE HAD LESS REGARD FOR RED TAPE THAN MOST CHIEF JUSTICES LIKE DOUGLAS HE FIRST MAINTAINED LAW AND ORDER AND THEN LOOKED UP TO SEE IF HE HAD ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
AND WHEN SHE EMERGED HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE WOULD HAVE THINNED PERCEPTIBLY THEN THE ROUGH MINER WHO HAD NOT ADDRESSED A WORD TO HER ON THE WAY DOWN FOR FEAR OF A CONFIDENCE MAN ABOARD WOULD PRESENT SUSY WITH A HANDSOME REWARD IN THE FORM OF A GAUDY DRESS OR A YEAR'S PROVISIONS
AND THE PRICE OF LAND DROPPED IN THE BOOM TOWNS OF THE FRASER AS SWIFTLY AS IT HAD BEEN BALLOONED UP PROSPECTING DURING THE WINTER IN A COUNTRY OF HEAVY SNOWFALL DID NOT SEEM A SANE PROJECT AND YET THE ETERNAL QUESTION URGED THE MINERS ON
THE DRIVER WAS ALWAYS A CRACK WHIP A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF AN OLD TIMER THOUGH OFTEN HIS YEARS NUMBERED FEWER THAN TWENTY MOST OF THE DRIVERS HOWEVER KNEW THE TRAIL FROM HAVING PACKED IN ON SHANKS'S MARE AND CAMPED UNDER THE STARS
THE MEN BUILT RUDE RAFTS AND POLED THEMSELVES OVER WITH THEIR PACK HORSES SWIMMING BEHIND THOSE WHO HAD OXEN KILLED THE OXEN AND SOLD THE BEEF OTHERS BREASTED THE MILL RACE OF THE FRASER IN CANOES AND DUGOUTS
THERE IS MORE DANGER GOING DOWN THAN COMING UP THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS COUNTRY BEING IMMENSELY RICH IN GOLD ALMOST EVERY BAR ON THE RIVER FROM YALE UP WILL PAY FROM THREE DOLLARS TO SEVEN DOLLARS A DAY TO THE MAN
ALL THE MOUNTAIN TORRENTS BECAME VOCAL WITH THE GLEE OF DISIMPRISONED LIFE RUNNING A RACE OF GLADNESS TO THE SEA THE SUN SETS EARLY IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH A GRADUAL HUSHING OF THE VOICE OF GLAD WATERS AND A RED GLOW AS OF WINE ON THE ENCIRCLING PEAKS
HALF A DOLLAR WAS THE SMALLEST COIN USED AND CLOTHING WAS SO SCARCE THAT WHEN A CHINAMAN'S PIG CHEWED UP WALTER MOBERLY'S BOOTS WHILE THE SURVEYOR LAY ASLEEP IN HIS SHACK MISTER MOBERLY HAD TO FOOT IT TWENTY FIVE MILES BEFORE HE COULD FIND ANOTHER PAIR OF BOOTS
A BOX LIKE APPEARANCE IT IS CONSIDERED BECOMING TO MEN
BECAUSE THEY ARE FULL OF QUICK CHANGES OF PROGRAM HE ENJOYS AS DOES EVERY TYPE CERTAIN KINDS OF MOVIES BUT HE CONSTITUTES NO SUCH PERCENTAGE OF THE MOVIE GOING AUDIENCE AS SOME OTHER TYPES READING
INCLINED TO BE UNORTHODOX OTHER TYPES TEND TO FOLLOW VARIOUS RELIGIONS ACCORDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S UPBRINGING BUT THE CEREBRAL COMPOSES A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE UNORTHODOX THE POLITICAL REFORMER
BUT THE MUSCULAR OFTEN DOES IT FOR PEOPLE HE SCARCELY KNOWS IF THEY STRIKE HIS FANCY OR APPEAL TO HIM
THEY OFTEN REFRAIN FROM ATTEMPTING A RECONCILIATION BUT THE THORACIC'S FORGIVENESS IS NOT ONLY SPONTANEOUS BUT GENUINE THE ALIMENTIVE BEARS NO GRUDGES BECAUSE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE
WE CAN NOT SMILE SOB SPEAK NOR SING WITHOUT USING THEM WE WOULD HAVE NO PIANISTS
AND THOUGH IT MAKES A DENT THAT DENT PUFFS BACK QUICKLY
HE IS THE LAST TYPE OF ALL TO SUBMIT TO WEARING LAST YEAR'S SUIT SINGING LAST YEAR'S SONGS
RECENTLY WE WERE EXHIBITING A SMALL PENCIL SHARPENER TO A MUSCULAR FRIEND IT WAS SO SHARP THAT IT PERFORMED ITS WORK WITHOUT PRESSURE BUT SHE TOOK HOLD OF IT AS IF IT WERE A PIECE OF ARTILLERY AND PUSHED THE PENCIL INTO IT WITH ALL THE FORCE SHE HAD WHEN WE REMONSTRATED SMILINGLY
THE ADVENTURERS ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE ALWAYS INTEREST THIS TYPE HE LIVES FOR THRILLS AND NOVEL REACTIONS AND USUALLY SPARES NO PAINS OR MONEY TO GET THEM
MADAME CURIE CO DISCOVERER OF RADIUM SAID TO BE THE GREATEST LIVING WOMAN OF THIS TYPE IS WORLD FAMOUS AND HAS DONE HUMANITY A NOBLE SERVICE BUT HER EXPERIMENTS WERE ALWAYS CARRIED ON AGAINST GREAT DISADVANTAGES
MAKES MOST SINGERS EVERY HAND ARTIST WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE SPATULATE FINGERED HANDS IN SHORT MUSCULAR HANDS THE HAND OF THE FAMOUS CRAFTSMAN PIANIST SCULPTOR AND PAINTER INSTEAD OF BEING MORE FRAIL AND DELICATE
HE IS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE WEARING EFFECT HE HAS ON OTHER PEOPLE A SENSE OF HUMOR SEEING THE FUNNY SIDE OF EVERYTHING IS A CAPACITY WHICH COMES MORE NATURALLY TO THIS TYPE THAN TO OTHERS THIS IS DUE TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FACT THAT
WITH ALL HIS OWN GIVING TO OTHERS HE SELDOM TAKES MUCH FROM OTHERS THE NATURALLY INDEPENDENT STANDING ON HIS OWN LEGS
THE SOCIAL NONCONFORMIST
BECAUSE ALL FORMS OF PERSONAL COMBAT ARE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM THE PURE CEREBRAL DOES NOT GO OUT AND FIGHT FOR REFORM AS OFTEN AS THE MUSCULAR NOR DIE FOR CAUSES AS OFTEN AS THE OSSEOUS TYPES BUT ALMOST EVERY CEREBRAL BELIEVES IN EXTREME REFORMS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
SOCIAL ASSETS
AND HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE AVERAGE GROUP OF MORE OR LESS DRAB PERSONALITIES LIVES IN THE HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS GLAD ONE MOMENT AND SAD THE NEXT
TO EACH THE KIND OF TRAINING WHICH WILL WEED OUT HIS WORST AND BRING OUT HIS BEST SHORT AND STOCKY
OTHER REASONS FOR THIS PREFERENCE ARE HIS BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONAL POWERS HIS CHARM AND HIS ENJOYMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE
IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN HANGING THE SCREEN DOOR CHOPPING THE WOOD OR DUSTING THE FURNITURE BUT IT WILL FURNISH HIM WITH SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY BECAUSE HE ENJOYS ACTION FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND BECAUSE WORK IS ONLY APPLIED ACTION THIS TYPE MAKES THE BEST WORKER
AND OF WASTING LESS ENERGY IN UNNECESSARY WORDS AND MOTIONS SHOULD AVOID ALL SITUATIONS CONDITIONS AND PEOPLE WHO SLIP THE BELT OFF THE WILL WHO TEND TO CUT LIFE UP INTO BITS BY DISSIPATION OR PLEASURE SEEKING
IN THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE HIS MUSCLES ARE FIRM AND LARGE SUCH MUSCLES CAN NOT BE DISGUISED BUT SEEM TO STAND OUT ALL OVER HIM HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD BE HELPLESS MASSES OF FAT AND BONE
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS TYPE EVEN THOUGH HE MAY HAVE
AND ARE MUCH BROADER IN PROPORTION TO HIS HEIGHT THE ALIMENTIVE HAS SLOPING SHOULDERS AND THE THORACIC INCLINES TO HIGH SHOULDERS
INIMICAL ENVIRONMENTS AND TO CONSTANTLY REMIND US OF THE PENALTIES WE PAY WHENEVER WE DIGRESS CHILD TRAINING AS THIS GREAT SCIENCE OF HUMAN ANALYSIS BECOMES KNOWN THE WORLD WILL UNDERSTAND FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES
THESE HAVE MADE HIM THE BORN ORATOR THE RADICAL
IT MAKES ME FEEL THAT I HAVE CHANGED MY LOCATION AND TAKES THE PLACE OF A TRIP EXPLAINED ONE GIRL NOT LONG AGO WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE EXACT COLOR OF HANGINGS WALL PAPER INTERIOR DECORATIONS AND ACCESSORIES
AND THESE LATTER GET CREDIT FOR A VIRTUOUSNESS THAT HAS COST THEM NOTHING PRAISE AND PUNISHMENT ON THE OTHER HAND EACH ONE OF THE FIVE HUMAN TYPES HAS CERTAIN POINTS OF STRENGTH AND FROM THESE GETS ITS NATURAL MORAL QUALITIES
HE YIELDS ONLY TO THOSE WHICH MAKE SUCH A STRONG APPEAL TO HIS TYPE THAT HE LACKS THE POWER OF RESISTANCE
THE OTHERS SOON DEVELOP GIRTH OR THE SITTING STILL HABIT TO THE POINT WHERE A CUSHIONED SEAT IN THE FIRST ROW OF THE PARQUET LOOKS MUCH BETTER DURABILITY IN CLOTHES SOMETHING THAT WILL WEAR WELL
A COMBINATION OF THE FIFTH TYPE WITH THE MUSCULAR MAKES MOST HAND ARTISTS
CO ORDINATED HAND MACHINE TO ANY SUCH DEGREE AS THE MUSCULAR
HE FREQUENTLY GOES TO SERIOUS LECTURES SOMETHING THE PURE ALIMENTIVE ALWAYS AVOIDS
OR MUSICAL COMPOSITION WHICH COULD MORE PROPERLY BE CALLED ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES
THE HANGINGS PICTURES AND FURNITURE MEAN MUCH TO HIM MOST PEOPLE LIKE MUSIC AT MEALS BUT TO THE THORACIC IT IS ALMOST INDISPENSABLE HE IS SO ALIVE IN EVERY NERVE
TONE DOWN THIS POWERFUL VOICE HIS LONG SUFFERING FRIENDS WILL TESTIFY TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC HIS STENTORIAN TONES THIS LOUD VOICE IS A SERIOUS SOCIAL HANDICAP TO HIM HIS ONLY CHANCE OF COMPENSATION FOR IT LIES
IS WHAT THIS TYPE ASKS FOR WHEN HE DROPS IN TO BUY A SUIT MUSCULARS ARE NOT PARSIMONIOUS NOR STINGY THEIR BUYING THE MOST DURABLE IN EVERYTHING IS NOT SO MUCH TO SAVE MONEY AS FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING SOMETHING THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE AFRAID TO HANDLE LIKES HEAVY MATERIALS
THOUGH ONE OF ANY HEIGHT MAY BE LARGELY MUSCULAR THE EXTREME TYPE OF WHICH WE ARE TREATING IN THIS CHAPTER
SHOULD AIM AT
BECAUSE WE ARE PRONE TO ADVISE OTHERS TO DO WHAT WE ENJOY DOING OURSELVES IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SO STRENUOUS A MAN AS T R SHOULD ADVOCATE WHOLESALE UNIVERSAL AND ALMOST COMPULSORY STRENUOSITY
OR THICKLY PADDED WITH FAT IN WHICH CASE
AND THE ACTIVITIES OF HIS LIFE WILL TEND IN THE DIRECTIONS REFERRED TO IN THIS CHAPTER THE MANUAL WORKER MUSCULARS ARE THE HAND WORKERS OF THE WORLD
IMPRACTICALITY DREAMINESS PHYSICAL FRAILTY AND HIS TENDENCY TO PLAN WITHOUT DOING ARE THE TRAITS WHICH STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS SUCCESS HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE SOCIALLY DON'T EXPECT HIM TO BE A SOCIAL LION DON'T EXPECT HIM TO MINGLE WITH MANY
THE THICKNESS OF HIS NECK MAY SOMETIMES GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MUSCULAR HEAD IS SMALL
HE CAN TALK ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT WHEN HE WILL
NOTHING IS TRULY HUMOROUS SAVE WHAT IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF PLUMB
BUT THEY ARE SO FORGIVING THEMSELVES
AND TAKES THE PAINS WITH THEM WHICH HE BESTOWS UPON HIS CLOTHES WHEN HE IS RICH WEALTH TO THE THORACIC MEANS UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY FOR ACHIEVING THE UNUSUAL IN EVERYTHING
ARE THE OUTSTANDING EMOTIONAL ASSETS OF THIS TYPE EMOTIONAL LIABILITIES IMPATIENCE MERCURIAL EMOTIONS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF TOO MUCH OF HIS ELECTRICITY IN EVERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE ARE THE TENDENCIES MOST TO BE GUARDED AGAINST
GETTING THINGS DONE THAT HE IS LIKELY TO FORGET
AND TREATING EZRA AND NEHEMIAH AS DIFFERENT BOOKS AND NOW GOD WHO HAS SPOKEN IN TIMES PAST BY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND VOICES SPOKE AT LAST TO THE NATIONS BY HIS SON
HE STILL LIVED ON SPEAKING AND WRITING OF HIS MASTER AND TO THE APOSTLE JOHN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ENTRUSTED THE RECORD OF MANY OF HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND COMFORTING WORDS AND OF THE DEEPEST AND MOST SPIRITUAL TEACHING IN THE WHOLE BIBLE
QUIVERING WITH INDIGNATION MATTATHIAS THEN TURNED TO THE STARTLED PEOPLE WHOSOEVER LOVES GOD LET HIM FOLLOW ME AND HE TURNED AND FLED SWIFTLY THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY
AND HOW NATION AFTER NATION HAD BEEN FORCED TO SUBMIT TO HIM UNTIL ALL THE THEN KNOWN WORLD OWNED HIM FOR ITS EMPEROR HE BUILT THIS CITY AND CALLED IT AFTER HIS OWN NAME ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE DAYS OF ANTIOCHUS
THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
SEEKING THE MESSIAH AND SAYING WHERE IS HE THAT IS BORN KING OF THE JEWS
HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH HORRIBLE AS IT SEEMS ALL THESE WICKED COMMANDS WERE CARRIED OUT A SOW WAS SLAUGHTERED ON THE ALTAR AND AN IMAGE OF JUPITER SET UP IN GOD'S HOLY TEMPLE MORE CRUEL THAN ALL
THIS IS THE WONDERFUL MESSAGE WHICH GOD GAVE TO THE WORLD THROUGH MATTHEW'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SCRIPTURES YEARS PASSED AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN CHRIST IN HIS EARTHLY LIFE HAD NEARLY ALL DIED
JOHN WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN BUT HE LIVED TO BE OLDER THAN ALL THE OTHER APOSTLES BY THE TIME THAT SAINT JOHN WROTE HIS GOSPEL JERUSALEM HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND HER INHABITANTS SLAIN OR SCATTERED
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS SOON THE DREADFUL ORDERS OF THE HEATHEN KING WERE CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM
BY WHOM ALSO HE MADE THE WORLDS HEBREWS
AND HERE ALSO ARE STORED THE PRECIOUS FRAGMENTS OF THE CHRONICLES OF THAT OTHER GREAT GREEK WRITER SAINT LUKE HOMER'S BOOK BELONGS TO THE FORGOTTEN PAST FOR THE HEATHEN RELIGION OF GREECE IS TO DAY AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN
THEREFORE THAT OTHERS MIGHT UNDERSTAND ALSO GOD'S SPIRIT CALLED JOHN WHEN HE WAS AN OLD MAN TO WRITE OUT THOSE PRECIOUS WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST'S WHICH WERE ALWAYS ECHOING IN HIS HEART AND WHICH THE OTHER WRITERS HAD NOT KNOWN OR HAD FORGOTTEN
THAT IN THE FIRST RECORDED WORDS SPOKEN BY GOD TO MOSES LAY A PROOF OF THE RESURRECTION AND OF LIFE AFTER DEATH LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST TIME IN WHICH CHRIST PUBLICLY READ AND EXPLAINED THE SCRIPTURES
LET US THINK FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE WITH THE SCRIPTURES IN THE DAYS WHEN THE LORD JESUS LEARNT TO READ THEIR WORDS AT HIS MOTHER'S KNEE WORDS WHICH FROM FIRST TO LAST TOLD OF HIMSELF
AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO WEEP FOR ONE WHO LIVES IN GOD HOW BEAUTIFUL TO KNOW THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY MEET THE WOMAN IN HEAVEN OF WHOM THESE WORDS ARE WRITTEN
IF WHEN YE BE BUFFETED FOR YOUR FAULTS YE SHALL TAKE IT PATIENTLY BUT IF WHEN YE DO WELL AND SUFFER FOR IT YE TAKE IT PATIENTLY THIS IS ACCEPTABLE WITH GOD BECAUSE CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR US LEAVING US AN EXAMPLE
THIS SET HIS DOUBTS AT REST FOR EVER
AND KEPT ALIVE IN THEIR HEARTS THE HOPE OF A COMING MESSIAH GOD MADE FOR THEM A WONDERFUL WAY OF ESCAPE EVERY BIBLE READER KNOWS AND LOVES THAT BEAUTIFUL SCENE BY THE WELL OF SYCHAR
HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO THINK WHAT A TERRIBLE GAP THERE WOULD BE IN THE HISTORY OF GOD'S DEALINGS WITH THE WORLD HAD THE ACTS NEVER BEEN WRITTEN THE APOSTLE PAUL'S LIFE WOULD BE ALMOST A BLANK STEPHEN'S VICTORIOUS DEATH WOULD BE ALL UNKNOWN TO US
THE PRIESTS THEMSELVES SHALL BE FORCED TO EAT OF IT AS FOR THE BOOKS OF THEIR LAW DESTROY THEM UTTERLY LET NOT A WORD REMAIN IN THE WHOLE LAND PUBLISH THIS ORDER AGAINST THE BOOK
AND TIME ITSELF BE KNOWN NO MORE BUT NEVER BEFORE AND NEVER AGAIN COULD THERE BE SO HEART SEARCHING OR SACRED A READING AS THIS WHEN THE SON OF GOD READ FROM HIS FATHER'S BOOK
AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
AND BESIDES BEING HIGHLY EDUCATED AND GIFTED HE TOOK INFINITE PAINS WITH HIS WORK HE COLLECTED ALL THE INFORMATION HE COULD BOTH FROM BOOKS AND EYE WITNESSES EITHER FROM THE SAVIOUR'S MOTHER HERSELF OR FROM SOME OF HER RELATIONS
FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
AS TO HOW THE CANON OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS FORMED THAT IS HOW AND WHEN DID THE JEWS FIRST BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE INSPIRED BY GOD ABOUT THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS
HE ATE NO MEAT DRANK NO WINE AND WORE NOTHING BUT WHITE LINEN GARMENTS THIS VOW IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT JAMES HAD NOT BELIEVED THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD UNTIL AFTER HIS RESURRECTION WHEN THE LORD APPEARED TO HIM
SO SAID THESE JEWISH PARENTS THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PROOF OF THE BIBLE'S LIVING POWER THE JEWS HAD CHANGED THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF THE CLEVEREST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN WERE WITHIN THEIR REACH FOR ALEXANDRIA HAD AT THIS TIME THE LARGEST LIBRARY IN THE WORLD
AND THEREFORE MORE CORRECT THAN THE JEWISH SCRIPTURES
THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
THIS ARMY OF GOD'S PEOPLE DROVE THE HEATHEN FROM THE CITIES OF JUDAH HOW THEY OVERTURNED THE HEATHEN ALTARS AND CAST DOWN THE IMAGES OF THE FALSE GODS
VALERIA SLEEPS IN PEACE SO THE CHRISTIAN WOMAN WAS LAID TO REST I LIFT UP MY HANDS AGAINST GOD WHO SNATCHED ME AWAY WE CAN STILL READ THESE DESPAIRING REBELLIOUS WORDS ON A HEATHEN TOMB
CHRIST HAD GIVEN HIM HIS NAME PETER
CONFESSING THEIR SINS AND PLEADING FOR PARDON SO THE VERY FIERCENESS OF THE TRIAL PROVED A BLESSING AND THE DAYS OF TORTURE WERE FOLLOWED BY A REVIVAL OF FAITH IN GOD AND DEVOTION TO HIS SERVICE
THE WAR AGAINST SIN AND THE DEVIL AND THE NAME OF THIS SECOND BOOK IS THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES IN ALL THIS WONDERFUL BIBLE OF OURS THERE IS NO BOOK MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE BOOK OF THE ACTS
HE CRIED WITH A SCORNFUL LAUGH YES BUT I WILL SOON ALTER THAT BEFORE THIS THERE HAD BEEN TROUBLE BETWEEN ANTIOCHUS AND THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
YET NO SOONER DID A DARING REBEL OR MURDERER GATHER A BAND OF ROBBERS AROUND HIM AND BEGIN TO KILL AND PLUNDER THAN MULTITUDES OF JEWS CRIED THE CHRIST OR MESSIAH HAS COME
THE WRITER OF THE GOSPEL WHICH COMES THE FIRST IN OUR NEW TESTAMENT WAS A LEVITE THAT IS HE BELONGED TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI AND THIS TRIBE WAS SPECIALLY CHOSEN IN THE TIME OF MOSES TO LEARN THE LAW AND SERVE GOD IN HIS TEMPLE
THE SAVIOUR HAD ONCE TOLD PETER THAT HE MUST FORGIVE HIS BROTHER ALTHOUGH HE WAS WRONGED BY HIM ON SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN OCCASIONS
NOW THE REVELATION THOUGH PLACED AT THE END OF OUR BIBLE WAS NOT THE LAST BOOK TO BE WRITTEN IT WAS PROBABLY COMPOSED WHILST NERO THE WICKED EMPEROR WAS TORTURING AND BURNING THE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST
SOUTH EAST AND WEST
ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIBLE WOULD ONLY LIE AS A DEAD WEIGHT UPON HIS SOUL THE LETTER KILLETH BUT THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE
BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
HOW WERE THE SACRED SCRIPTURES FIRST DIVIDED FROM THE OTHER JEWISH WRITINGS WE DO NOT KNOW SOME HAVE THOUGHT THAT EZRA THE SCRIBE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A COUNCIL OF ELDERS FIXED THE CANON OF HEBREW SCRIPTURE
NINETEEN HE CLOSES THE BOOK AND SITS DOWN FROM THE DIM AGES OF THE PAST THOSE WORDS HAD BEEN READ IN THE LONG LONG AGES TO COME THEY WILL YET BE READ UNTIL THE WORLD SHALL CEASE TO EXIST
THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
SO WHEN THE COLONEL DIED IN THE YEAR I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO MOURNING FOR HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE CHOSE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MY ALLOWANCE WAS DUE
IT SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS THE SPLASH FROM A STONE SPREADS OVER A MILL POND NOW THAT'S A NICE CHEERFUL SORT OF THING TO SAY TO A FELLAH HE EJACULATED FIXING HIS EYE GLASS IN HIS EYE WITH A FEW
SHE HAD FLAYED ALIVE THE GREATER PART OF LONDON SOCIETY WITH KEEN WIT AND SPRIGHTLINESS I LAUGHED AGAINST MY WILL AT HER ILL TEMPERED SALLIES THEY WERE TOO FUNNY NOT TO AMUSE IN SPITE OF THEIR VITRIOL AS FOR THE COUNT
AND INSPECTED ME ALL OVER AGAIN WELL I DECLARE SHE MURMURED WHAT ARE GIRLS COMING TO I WONDER GIRTON YOU SAY GIRTON THAT PLACE AT CAMBRIDGE YOU SPEAK GREEK OF COURSE BUT HOW ABOUT GERMAN
THOUGH AS I SHOW THEM THERE ARE SHEKELS IN IT TOO DIVIDENDS DIVIDENDS DI VIDENDS BUT YOU ARE A LADY OF UNDERSTANDING AND COMPREHENSION YOU HAVE BEEN TO GIRTON HAVEN'T YOU PERHAPS YOU READ GREEK THEN
WENT ON TO UNFOLD HIS SYSTEM OF INTERPRETATION WHICH WAS OF A STRICTLY COMMERCIAL OR COMPANY PROMOTING CHARACTER IT RAN LIKE A PROSPECTUS
THE SAID HAROLD ASHURST TILLINGTON CONSENTS TO MARRY I THINK THAT SOUNDS BETTER HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH FATHERLY REGARD THAT IT PRICKED MY HEART EVER TO HAVE POKED FUN AT HIS INTERPRETATION OF PROPHECY ON STOCK EXCHANGE PRINCIPLES I THINK I FLUSHED CRIMSON NO
TO MAKE UP FOR IT HE TALKED MUCH AND WITH ANIMATION TO LADY GEORGINA THEY FERRETED OUT FRIENDS IN COMMON AND WERE AS MUCH SURPRISED AT IT AS PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AT THAT INEVITABLE EXPERIENCE AH YES MADAME I RECOLLECT HIM WELL IN VIENNA
BUT PERHAPS IN THIS SUGGESTION I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TONED RESPECTFULLY CYRUS W HITCHCOCK THE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED FOR ELSIE TO BE FIRM I HAVE NO PREJUDICE AGAINST TRADE BROWNIE SHE OBSERVED EMPHATICALLY
AND HIGGINSON IS AN IDIOT
LIKE A NATIVE I ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL PROMPTITUDE I WAS AT SCHOOL IN CANTON BERNE
I CUT OUT HALF HER CLOTHES FOR HER HER OWN IDEAS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY LIMITED TO DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS AND CUTTING OUT A BLOUSE BY DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IS WEARY UPHILL WORK FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER
YOU'RE WHAT I CALL A FIRST RATE COMPANION FOR A VOYAGE DOWN THE RED SEA HE PUT IN GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE AWNINGS SUCH A LOVELY FREEZING MIXTURE A FELLAH DOESN'T NEED ICES WHEN YOU'RE ON TAP
ORDINARY PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SO FLAVOURLESS
AS SOON AS I'VE CLEANED MYSELF AND EMBRACE THE FIRST STRAY ENTERPRISE THAT OFFERS OUR BAGDAD TEEMS WITH ENCHANTED CARPETS LET ONE BUT FLOAT MY WAY AND HI PRESTO I SEIZE IT
I MADE UP MY MIND AT ONCE MISTER ASHURST I SAID LOOKING UP FROM MY KEYBOARD I CAN GIVE YOU THIS GIRL'S NAME AND THEN YOU CAN INSERT THE PROVISO IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN
STILL WE MAY SELL A FEW BUT I DESCRY ANOTHER OPENING YOU WRITE SHORTHAND DON'T YOU A LITTLE DEAR
THAT I WAS MAKING GAME OF HIM HOWEVER HE FISHED UP A NAME ONCE MORE AND CLUTCHED AT IT SAVONAROLA TOO HE ADVENTURED I ADORE SAVONAROLA
DEAR MISS YOUR SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE IS REALLY REMARKABLE
I SAY CONTINENTAL BECAUSE I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE OUT WHETHER HE WAS FRENCH GERMAN OR AUSTRIAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS IN EVERY WAY TO MEET LADY GEORGINA'S WISHES DID MADAME DESIRE TO HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN OH CERTAINLY WITH PLEASURE THE DAY WAS SO SULTRY
COME ELSIE I SAID FIRMLY THIS IS TOO RIDICULOUS LET US GIVE THEM A CLEAR BERTH
FOR I WILL DO MYSELF THE JUSTICE TO ADMIT THAT THE FIRST WAS MY OWN INITIATIVE AND ENTERPRISE
AND ON WITHOUT INJURY TO THE TEMPER A REAL BENEFACTOR MISS CAYLEY A REAL BENEFACTOR TO THE LINK WEARING CLASSES FOR HE HAS SENSIBLY DIMINISHED THE AVERAGE ANNUAL OUTPUT OF PROFANE SWEARING
I THINK YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BEFORE ONE THAT CANNOT BE PUT OFF QUITE SO VERY WELL THEN YES WE ARE BOTH AT YOUR SERVICE THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR A SEAT I PUSHED HIM OUR ONE EASY CHAIR
WHEN HE LEFT FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT FREDERIC HIGGINSON COURIER I WAS TEMPTED TO INTERPOSE BUT I REFRAINED IN TIME AND I WAS GLAD OF IT AFTERWARDS AT LAST
IF SO HIS OBVIOUS CUE WOULD BE TO PROMOTE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HAROLD AND MYSELF IN ORDER TO MAKE US MARRY SO THAT THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMEN MIGHT THEN DISINHERIT HIS FAVOURITE NEPHEW AND MAKE A NEW WILL
I WAS NOT ASKING ON MISTER TILLINGTON'S ACCOUNT I ANSWERED I ASKED BECAUSE I HAVE A PERSONAL FEELING OF FRIENDSHIP FOR YOUR UNCLE MISTER ASHURST HIS HAND STRAYED UP TO THE STRAGGLING YELLOW HAIRS ON HIS UPPER LIP ONCE MORE
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR HAROLD TILLINGTON YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANYONE AND BETTAH FOR IT WAS YOU WHO DREW UP HIS WILL FOR HIM AT FLORENCE I FLUSHED CRIMSON I BELIEVE
YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT DOCTOR FORTESCUE LANGLEY TOO I SUPPOSE I WENT ON
YOU NEVER WILL LEARN WHAT I MEAN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE NO NO I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE WHAT ADVENTURE MAY COME I HAVE NOT AT THIS MOMENT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
NOT THE OBVIOUS BEAUTY OF MERE YOUTH AND HEALTH' HE GLANCED ACROSS AT ME DISDAINFULLY THE PROFOUNDER BEAUTY OF DEEP CHARACTER IN A FACE THAT CALM AND SERENE BEAUTY
MISTER ASHURST WAS LADY GEORGINA VENEERED WITH A THIN LAYER OF INGRATIATING URBANITY LADY GEORGINA WAS CLEVER AND THEREFORE ACRIMONIOUS MISTER ASHURST WAS ASTUTE AND THEREFORE OBSEQUIOUS
COMMEND ME TO THE NOBLE DOWAGER
HAS ON MY INFANT EAR FROM THE FIRST BEGINNING IMPRESSED ITSELF THE OLD LADY LAUGHED ALOUD DON'T JABBER IT TO ME CHILD SHE CRIED I HATE THE LINGO
THEN SHE SCANNED ME UP AND DOWN AS IF I WERE A GIRL IN A MANTLE SHOP AND SHE CONTEMPLATED BUYING EITHER ME OR THE MANTLE AT LAST CATCHING MY EYE SHE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
THOSE LITTLE LIPS COULD NEVER FRAME THEMSELVES TO SCHLECHT OR WUNDERSCHOEN THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT FOR IT PARDON ME I ANSWERED IN GERMAN WHAT I SAY THAT I MEAN THE NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MUSIC OF THE FATHERLAND'S SPEECH
HE SAID TENTATIVELY WITH AN INQUIRING AIR YET BEAMING AT HIS SUCCESS DON'T YOU THINK SO SPLENDID ARTIST RAPHAEL AND A VERY SAFE GUESS I ANSWERED LEADING HIM ON
HE FETCHED AND CARRIED FOR US WITH A COURTLY GRACE WHICH RECALLED THAT DISTINGUISHED DIPLOMAT THE COMTE DE LAROCHE SUR LOIRET AT THE STATION AT MALINES WITH LADY GEORGINA IT IS TRUE
YES I KNOW I ADMIT ALL THAT SO I DECLINED HIS OFFER I DID NOT WISH TO RUIN HIS PROSPECTS THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN EYED ME WITH A SUDDEN TENDERNESS IN HIS GLANCE YOUNG MEN ARE LUCKY HE SAID SLOWLY AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
PERHAPS MY BEWILDERMENT SHOWED ITSELF UPON MY FACE FOR AT LAST HE LOOKED QUEERLY AT ME YOU DON'T QUITE LIKE THIS I'M AFRAID HE SAID BREAKING OFF SHORT I WAS THE SOUL OF BUSINESS NOT AT ALL I ANSWERED I AM AN AUTOMATON
I WALKED ACROSS TO MISSUS EVELEGH'S DESK AND BEGAN WRITING A LETTER IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MISTER HITCHCOCK WHO WAS A MAN OF BUSINESS MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP A WOMAN OF BUSINESS IN THIS DELICATE MATTER I PUT THE POINT TO HIM FAIRLY AND SQUARELY
HE LEANT FORWARD WITH HIS FAT HANDS ON HIS AMPLE KNEES IT WAS REALLY YOU HE INQUIRED OPEN MOUTHED I NODDED THERE IS NO USE IN DENYING THE TRUTH MISTER TILLINGTON DID ASK ME TO BE HIS WIFE AND I REFUSED HIM
THEY SEE NOTHING ABOVE PERCENTAGES THAT'S IT HE REPLIED LIGHTING UP THEY HAVE NO HIGHER FEELINGS THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WILL BE DIVIDENDS TOO MARK MY WORDS THERE WILL BE DIVIDENDS
IT WAS THAT VARIABLE STAR OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE MISTER HIGGINSON THE COURIER
MY LETTERS TO THE DAILY TELEPHONE GAVE SATISFACTION MY EMPLOYER WROTE YOU ARE A BORN JOURNALIST I CONFESS THIS SURPRISED ME FOR I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF A TRUTHFUL PERSON STILL AS HE EVIDENTLY MEANT IT FOR PRAISE
THERE'S ONE GOOD THING ABOUT FLORENCE ELSIE I SAID JUST TO KEEP UP HER COURAGE WHEN THE CUSTOMERS DO COME THEY'LL BE INTERESTING PEOPLE AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING WORK
THAT THE COLOURLESS YOUNG MAN HAD TORN HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE MUD HONEY OF PICCADILLY FOR THIS VOYAGE TO INDIA ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MEETING ME THAT WAS A POLITIC MOVE WHOEVER PLANNED IT HIMSELF OR HIGGINSON
NO IT WAS NOT THE HOUSE IT WAS AGAIN SHE WAITED NOT KNOWING HOW TO INTRODUCE HER HUSBAND'S NAME A MYSTERY A VISITOR AT THIS HOUR AND SEEMINGLY A LADY
HE CREPT BENEATH THEM AND LAY STILL
AND SHOULD HE WAIT OH YES WAIT CRIED CASSANDRA WHAT IF DAVID WERE NOT THERE AND OF COURSE HE MIGHT BE OUT THEN THEY WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THE DARK INTERIOR
HIT'S THAT A WAY WITH ALL THE FARWELLS THEY BEEN THAT QUARELLIN AN BAD MAKIN MEAN WHISKEY AN DRINKIN HIT RAW
ABOVE HIS HEAD LAID UPON CROSS BEAMS WERE BUNDLES OF WOOL UNCARDED AND CARDING BOARDS HUNG FROM NAILS IN THE LOGS IN ONE CORNER WAS A RUDELY CONSTRUCTED REEL AND FROM THE LOOM DANGLED THE IDLE SHUTTLE FILLED WITH FINE BLUE YARN OF WOOL
HE OPENED HIS MOTHER'S LETTER AND SLOWLY READ IT THEN PASSED IT TO HIS FRIEND AND RISING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD GAZING DOWN INTO THE SQUARE
THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL THEY HEARD HIS BARK OF JOY AND THEN THEY WOULD SEIZE HIM HE CREPT CLOSE TO THE ROCK WHERE THE WATER RUSHED NOT A FOOT AWAY AND CLINGING TO THE TOUGH LAUREL BEHIND HIM LEANED FAR OVER
LIKE THE MOANING OF THE LOST SOULS OF ALL THE AGES WHO HAD LIVED AND TOILED AND SMOTHERED IN THIS MONSTROUS AND TERRIBLE CITY AH SHE MUST GET OUT OF IT SHE MUST HURRY HURRY AND FIND DAVID HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIS LITTLE SON
ALL THAT THE OLD DOCTOR DID WAS WELL AND THOROUGHLY DONE HIS APPETITE SHARPENED BY THE CLIMB AND THE BRACING AIR DAVID INVESTIGATED THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THOSE MELON SHAPED BASKETS WHICH CASSANDRA HAD GIVEN HIM WHEN HE STARTED FOR HIS NEW HOME THAT MORNING
THEY WOULD ALL FLOCK TO HER AND PESTER HER WITH THEIR OUTCRY OF HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY I CAN HEAR THEM AND SEE THEM NOW I TELL YOU IF A MAN STEPS OUT OF THE BEATEN TRACK OVER THERE IF HE ATTEMPTS TO ORDER HIS OWN LIFE MARRY TO PLEASE HIMSELF
HE PULLED DAVID DOWN AND WHISPERED THE QUESTION IN HIS EAR NO NO SHE ONLY MEANS THAT YOU'RE A DEAR QUEER LITTLE CHAP
SHE BE'N A GOOD STEPMAW TO YE
HIS BRIDLE HANGING FROM HIS NECK THE BIT DANGLING WHILE HE ALSO MADE HIS REPAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS CORN AND SHE HAD FINISHED HER ELABORATE FAREWELLS AT THE BEDSIDE AND LITTLE HOYLE HAD WITH MUCH EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN BRIDLING HER STEED
AND WHEN AT LAST THEY STOPPED BEFORE A GREAT HOUSE BUILT IN ON EITHER SIDE BY OTHER HOUSES WITH WIDE STEPS OF STONE DESCENDING DIRECTLY UPON THE STREET SHE HAD REGAINED A MEASURE OF COMPOSURE SHE WAS ASSURED BY THE CABMAN
SHE'S THAT BAD HURTED PAW AN I WE GOT HER TO BED
WOULD GOD HE HAD LIVED TO FILL THIS PLACE HE SAID DESPERATELY THE LAWYER BOWED DEFERENTIALLY AND DOCTOR HOYLE TOOK DAVID'S ARM AND LED HIM AWAY AS IF HE WERE HIS SON NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN BY EITHER OF THEM
BUT THE NAME MY LORD THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE LINEAGE THAT LAST WAS ALREADY MINE AND FOR THE TITLE I HAVE NEVER COVETED IT
BRUSHED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND CAUGHT UP A BATTERED SILK HAT HE TURNED IT ABOUT AND LOOKED AT IT RUEFULLY WITH A QUIZZICAL SMILE PLAYING ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES REMEMBER THAT HAT HE ASKED WELL DO I REMEMBER IT
AND THEREFORE HAD NEVER DESIRED NOW GIVEN HIM BY SO CRUEL A BLOW HE WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM WHATEVER DUTY
HE KNOWED HE HADN'T OUGHT TO RILE ME LIKE HE DONE I BE'N TRYIN TO MAKE HIS HOSS GO HOME
THE LOOM SHED WAS ONE OF THE LOG CABINS CONNECTED WITH THE MAIN BUILDING BY A ROOFED PASSAGE
UNFELT BY HER SO COMPLETELY WAS SHE PROTECTED BY THE THICKLY GROWING LAUREL AND RHODODENDRON ON EITHER SIDE OF HER PATH THE SNOW OF THE DAY BEFORE WAS GONE LEAVING ONLY THE GLISTENING WETNESS OF IT ON STONES AND FALLEN LEAVES AND TWIGS UNDERFOOT
AND AGAIN WAITING WITH ALMOST A SMILE ON HER PARTED LIPS AS HE SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT AH YES IT WAS MORNING
HOYLE HAD BEEN PLACED IN A SMALL WARD WHERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER LITTLE BEDS BOTH OCCUPIED WITH ONE NURSE TO ATTEND ON THE THREE PATIENTS ONE OF THEM HAD BROKEN HIS LEG AND HAD TO LIE IN A CAST AND THE OTHER
THRYNG MEANT SOON TO GO TO WORK TO TAKE OUT THE BED COVERS AND AIR THEM AND TO FIND THE CANVAS AND NAIL IT OVER THE FRAMEWORK BESIDE THE CABIN WHICH WAS TO SERVE AS A SLEEPING APARTMENT ALL SHOULD BE DONE IN TIME
AND WALKED RAPIDLY AND RESTLESSLY ABOUT THE SMALL APARTMENT AND LAUGHED IN SYMPATHY IT'S NOT NOT I KNOW DAVID GREW INSTANTLY SOBER AGAIN OF COURSE THE LITTLE CHAP'S CASE IS SERIOUS
THEN BREAKING OFF A BIT OF THE ROOT SHE CHEWED IT WHILE SHE THRUST THE REST IN HER BAG AND USED THE TOP FOR A SWITCH WITH WHICH TO HASTEN THE PACE OF HER NAG THE SMALL STONES LOOSENED WHEN SHE TORE THE SHRUB FROM THE BANK RATTLED DOWN WHERE THE SOIL HAD BEEN WASHED AWAY
MERELY A MULE TRACK ARCHED WITH HORNBEAM AND DOGWOOD AND MULBERRY TREES AND TOWERED OVER BY GIANT CHESTNUTS AND OAKS AND GREAT WHITE PINES AND DEEP GREEN HEMLOCKS THROUGH MYRIAD LEAFLESS BRANCHES THE WIND SOUGHED PLEASANTLY OVERHEAD
I'VE KNOWN I'VE KNOWN CURIOUS BUT WHY HELLO
LIST'NIN TO ALL WE SAY FRALE COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE WORDS BUT HIS FACE BURNED RED WITH RAGE HAD HE BEEN IN HIDING DOWN BELOW HE WOULD HAVE WREAKED VENGEANCE ON THE MAN AS IT WAS
ALL I FETCHED UP LAST WEEK HE DONE ET HE TURNED TO WALK AWAY BUT STOOD WITH AVERTED HEAD AS SHE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN DON'T YOU DO NO SUCH FOOL THING
IT WAS NOT THAT THE MONEY HAD BEEN MADE IN COMMERCE HE WAS NEITHER A SNOB NOR A CAD ALTHOUGH HIS OWN CONNECTIONS ENTITLED HIM TO HONOR WHAT MORE COULD HE EXPECT THAN TO MARRY WEALTH AND BE HAPPY IF IF HAPPINESS COULD COME TO EITHER OF THEM IN THAT WAY
AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES NOW SO RUTHLESSLY THRUST UPON HIM OF HIS MOTHER'S GRIEF AND HIS OWN
HE COULD THINK ONLY OF HIS MOTHER HE SAW HER FACE AGED AND GRIEF STRICKEN HE KNEW HOW SHE LOVED THE BOY SHE HAD LOST ABOVE ALL AND NOW SHE MUST TURN TO HIMSELF
DAVID NEVER HEARD THE CLINKING OF GLASSES AND BOTTLES BORNE ON A TRAY WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S SICKENING SINKING OF THE HEART AND THE FOREBODING THAT SEEMED TO DRENCH HIM WITH DISMAY AS THE GLASSES WERE PLACED ON THE STAND AT MISTER STRETTON'S ELBOW
NOW THEY WERE DISMOUNTING AND QUESTIONING THE BOY NOW THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE HOUSE HE DID NOT MOVE WHY WERE THEY SO LONG WITHIN HOURS IT SEEMED TO FRALE BUT IN REALITY IT WAS ONLY A SHORT SEARCH THEY WERE MAKING THERE THEY WERE LONGER LOOKING ABOUT THE SHEDS AND YARD
AHEM AHEM YOUR LORDSHIP ON BEHALF OF YOUR MOTHER HAVING COME EXPRESSLY HE TURNED AGAIN TO DAVID AH NOW DON'T BE AT ALL ALARMED I BEG OF YOU I SEE I HAVE DISTURBED YOU SHE IS QUITE WELL OR WAS A WEEK OR MORE AGO
IT WAS A PLEASANT MORNING IN LONDON WITH AS CLEAR A SKY AS IS EVER PERMITTED TO THAT GREAT CITY CASSANDRA HAD PLACED HER LITTLE SON IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE BED WHICH NEARLY FILLED THE SMALL ROOM SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN IN A HOTEL
OF COURSE HER HUSBAND WAS HIS LORDSHIP OVER HERE I AM FROM AMERICA AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE GALLERY SHE MUST DO SO TO GIVE A PRETEXT FOR HAVING COME TO VISIT AN EMPTY HOUSE
LET ME HOPE WILL FOLLOW THE CONSERVATIVE POLICY OF YOUR HONORED UNCLE AND I SAY I MUST THINK IT OVER MAY I NOT HAVE A DAY A SINGLE DAY IN WHICH TO MOURN THE LOSS OF MY SPLENDID BROTHER
AN' HERE I MADE THIS'N FER YOU HE PAUSED AND SELECTED CAREFULLY AMONG THE PILE OF PAPERS UNDER HIS HAND
HE WALKED ON A FEW STEPS AT HER SIDE THEN STOPPED SUDDENLY I LOW I BETTER BIDE WHAR I BE YOU UNS HAIN'T BEEN YANDAH TO THE FALL HAVE YE I HAVE YOU DONE A HEAP MO'N YOU RECKONED ON
I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT MY LORD IT IS YOURS YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF YOU KNOW A THE THE POSITION IS YOURS AND YOU WILL A FILL IT WITH DIGNITY AND A
AND IN THE SMALL ROOM ALL THOSE HEAVY FURNISHINGS CLOSED AROUND HER DARK RED STUFFY AND GREASY WITH LONDON SMOKE SHE COULD NOT TOUCH THEM WITHOUT BLACKENING HER HANDS NOR LET HER BABY SIT ON THE FLOOR
HALF DRESSED AS SHE WAS AND MURMURED PRETTY COOING PHRASES KISSING AND CUDDLING HIM TO CONTENTED LAUGHTER BETTY TOWERS HAD PROCURED CLOTHING FOR HER A MODEST SUPPLY
HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON A JUTTING ROCK WELL SCREENED BY LAUREL SHRUBS ON ALL SIDES BUT THE ONE TOWARD THE FALL THERE HIS KNEES CLASPED ABOUT WITH HIS ARMS AND HIS CHIN RESTING UPON THEM HE SAT AND WATCHED
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WILMA'S HIDING PLACE AND THE DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE HAN SHIP WAS NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET SHE WAS ALREADY CROUCHED WITH HER FEET BRACED AGAINST A METAL BEAM TAKING THE LIFT OF THAT WONDERFUL INERTRON BELT INTO HER CALCULATION
SOMETIMES EVEN SERVING THEM AS SLAVES IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR SERVICE MACHINERY TO PERFECTION THERE IS SUCH A GANG CALLED THE NAGRAS UP NEAR BAH FLO AND ANOTHER IN MID JERSEY
NOW OUT OF FOCUS CONTROL DIMLY SHOWED THE LANDING PARTY WALKING BACK TOWARD THE SHIP
AMAZING AND IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMS THERE IS A GROUP OR PERHAPS AN ENTIRE GANG SOMEWHERE AMONG US THAT IS BETRAYING US TO THE HANS IT MAY BE THE BAD BLOODS
HART WARNED WE'LL RISK IT
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OCCASIONAL BARTER RATHER THAN AN OUT AND OUT ALLIANCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR FUTURE BARTERING PERHAPS YES HART SAID
SUFFICE IT TO SAY HOWEVER THAT I SURVIVED THIS PSYCHIC CRISIS
WERE THE REVERSE OF EACH OTHER IN EFFICIENCY THESE MODERN AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE KNEW LITTLE OF HAND TO HAND FIGHTING AND NOTHING NATURALLY OF TRENCH WARFARE OF BARRAGES THEY WERE QUITE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THEY POSSESSED WEAPONS OF TERRIFIC POWER
I THOUGHT OTHERWISE HER SKULL MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRACTURED OH MY HEAD SHE GROANED COMING TO AS I LIFTED HER GENTLY IN MY ARMS AND STRODE OUT IN THE OPEN WITH HER
FOR SHE EVIDENTLY HAD HIT HER HEAD AGAINST THE PARTITION WITHIN THE SHIP INTO WHICH SHE HAD CRASHED WE HAD MADE SOME NOISE WITHIN THE SHIP SHUFFLING FOOTSTEPS WERE APPROACHING DOWN A WELL LIT GANGWAY
OR FROM WHICH THERE WAS ANY NEED TO OBSERVE IT THE HANS HAD NEGLECTED TO LIGHT THE TOWER ROOF OR INDEED TO OCCUPY IT AT ALL THIS WAS THE REASON WE HAD SELECTED IT AS OUR LANDING PLACE AS SOON AS GIBBONS HAD OUR WORD HE EXTINGUISHED THE KNOB LIGHT
AND IT ISN'T INFORMATION THE HANS ARE GIVING IN RETURN BUT SOME FORM OF GOODS OR PRIVILEGE
IN THE END THE HUNDRED MEN WERE RINGED ABOUT THE VALLEY ON THE HILLSIDES AND TOPS EACH IN A POSITION FROM WHICH HE HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE WRECKAGE OF THE HAN SHIP BUT NOT A MAN HAD COME IN VIEW SO FAR AS I COULD SEE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS
TELEPROJECTOSCOPE VIEWS OF THE WRECK AND THE BOWL OF THE VALLEY SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF TRIBESMEN NEITHER SHIP REGISTERS NOR BASE REGISTERS SHOWED ANY INDICATION OF ELECTROACTIVITY EXCEPT FROM THE SQUADRON ITSELF
THE OTHERS MUST HAVE CRASHED DOWN WHILE I WAS DEAFENED BY THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION OF MY OWN ROCKETS SOMEBODY HIT THE OTHER REPELLOR RAY OF ONE OF THE TWO REMAINING SHIPS AND IT FELL OUT OF SIGHT BEYOND A HILLTOP THE OTHER FARTHER AWAY
OUR VICTORY OVER THE SEVEN HAN SHIPS HAD SET THE COUNTRY ABLAZE THE SECRET HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED TO THE OTHER GANGS AND THE COUNTRY WAS AGOG FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER THERE WAS FEVERISH ACTIVITY IN THE AMMUNITION PLANTS
BUT WILMA LOOKED AT ME MEANINGLY AND POINTED TO WHERE THE TWISTED PLATES OF THE SHIP PROJECTING FROM THE GROUND OFFERED A SHELTER TOO LATE BOSS SHE SAID THEY'D SEE US
THAT ONE WAS CONTAINED ENTIRELY IN A SMALL POCKET CASE THESE WITH WHICH WE WERE NOW EQUIPPED CONSISTED OF A PAIR OF EAR DISCS EACH A SEPARATE AND SELF CONTAINED RECEIVING SET THEY SLIPPED INTO LITTLE POCKETS OVER OUR EARS IN THE FABRIC HELMETS WE WORE
THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE HAS NO INDICATION OF THE KIND OF DISASTER WHICH OVERTOOK THE SQUADRON EXCEPT CERTAIN EVIDENCES OF EXPLOSIVE PHENOMENA
THIS MEANT THE THIRD PROJECTOSCOPE FROM THE BOW OF THE SHIP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LOWER DECK WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THE LANDING GROUP AS IT WALKED AROUND THE WRECK
BUT NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF TRIBESMEN THE CONTROL ROOM VIEWPLATE IS ALSO A CHAOTIC RECORD OF THE SHIP'S CREW TUMBLING AND FALLING TO THE REAR WALL THEN THE FORWARD REP RAY GENERATOR EXPLODED AND ALL SIGNALS WENT DEAD
I RAN BACK TO THE ENTRANCE COMPARTMENT WILMA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD SLUMPED DOWN I HEARD THE VOICES OF THE HANS APPROACHING IT WAS TIME TO ACT THE NEXT FEW SECONDS WOULD TELL WHETHER THE SHIPS IN THE AIR WOULD TRY OR BE ABLE TO MELT US INTO NOTHINGNESS
ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL OF BOSSES UNH HAD INTENDED WAITING A FEW YEARS UNTIL ENOUGH ROCKET SHIPS HAVE BEEN UNH BUILT BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE SACRIFICE UNH
WHERE GAUNT AND BLASH ASSURED US THE MILITARY OFFICES WERE LOCATED TWICE BARKER CAUTIONED US TO STOP AS WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS IN FRONT OF MIRROR LIKE WINDOWS IN THE PASSAGE WALL AND FLATTENING OURSELVES TO THE FLOOR WE CRAWLED PAST THEM
THE CHEST DISCS WERE LIKEWISE SELF CONTAINED SENDING SETS STRAPPED TO THE CHEST A FEW INCHES BELOW THE NECK AND ACTUATED BY THE VIBRATIONS FROM THE VOCAL CORDS THROUGH THE BODY TISSUES THE TOTAL RANGE OF THESE SETS WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES
CLOSELY BUNCHED AND TREADING AS LIGHTLY AS ONLY INERTRON BELTED PEOPLE COULD
ALONG THE LINES OF THE REGULAR ARMIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ITS BUSINESS WILL BE TWOFOLD TO CARRY THE WARFARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THE HANS AND TO SERVE AS A DECOY
THE DEDUCTION THAT THE TRIBESMEN HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW AND AS YET UNDETERMINED TECHNIQUE OF ATTACK ON AIRSHIPS AND HAS RECOMMENDED TO THE HEAVEN BORN THAT IMMEDIATE AND UNLIMITED AUTHORITY BE GIVEN THE NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
I RAN TO THE DOOR EXPECTING ANY INSTANT TO BE HURLED INTO INFINITY BY THE SWEEP OF A DISINTEGRATOR RAY SOME EIGHTH OF A MILE AWAY I SAW ONE OF THE SHIPS CRASH TO EARTH A DISINTEGRATOR RAY CAME INTO MY LINE OF VISION
FOR THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THEIR OLD BUT EXTREMELY ACCURATE SYSTEM OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL BUT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THEM FOR THE PAST WEEK BY INSTALLING AUTOMATIC RE BROADCAST UNITS ALONG THE SCAR PATHS THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICANS CALLED THOSE STRIPS OF COUNTRY
WAS AS QUICKLY DEPOSED EITHER BY THEM OR BY HIS SUPERIORS AS THE ANCIENT WARD LEADER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO LOST CONTROL OF HIS VOTES AS SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
A CAREFUL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORY SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN BEAMED BY THE FIRST HAN SHIP THE SYNTHETIC FABRICS PLANT HAD BEEN PARTIALLY WIPED OUT THOUGH THE LOWER LEVELS UNDERGROUND HAD NOT BEEN REACHED BY THE DIS RAY
WHICH MIGHT GIVE SHELTER TO THE AMERICANS BUT THEY'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSE PATHS SO HARD IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY EVEN HAD INFORMATION OF THIS STRATEGY AND IN ADDITION THEY'VE BEEN USING CODE FINALLY WE'VE PICKED UP THREE OF THEIR MESSAGES
WE NOTICED TOO THAT THE ROCK IN THE SIDE WALLS OF THE SHAFT WAS SOFT EVIDENTLY DUE TO THE RADIOACTIVITY AND PIECES CRUMBLED UNDER FOOT RATHER EASILY WE MADE OUR WAY CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE SHAFT WHEN SUDDENLY THE ROTTED TIMBERS ABOVE US GAVE WAY
IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS WITH SOME NERVOUSNESS THE EXISTENCE OF OUR MYSTERIOUS ULTROPHONE BUT THEY STILL HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND CONTROL OF ULTRONIC ACTIVITY I ASKED NO SAID THE BIG BOSS THOUGHTFULLY
FROM THE RECORD OF ITS LOCATION FINDER BEFORE IT WENT DEAD RECENTLY
SWINGING IN WIDE ARCS RECORDED LITTLE OF VALUE EXCEPT AT THE ENDS OF THEIR SWINGS ONE OF THESE FROM A MACHINE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE SET IN TELESCOPIC FOCUS SHOWS SEVERAL VIEWS OF GREAT VALUE IN PICTURING THE FALLS OF THE OTHER SHIPS
DID NOT APPLY AS WELL TO TWENTIETH CENTURY CONDITIONS AS TO THOSE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH IN LATER YEARS I FELT THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SOFTENING OF MORAL FIBER AMONG THE PEOPLE
SOMEWHERE IN NU YOK OR BAH FLO OR POSSIBLY IN LO TAN ITSELF THE RECORD OF THIS TRAITOROUS TRANSACTION WOULD BE MORE OR LESS OPENLY FILED IF WE COULD ONLY GET AT IT
INSTEAD OF BY THAT RIGID MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND COMPLETE ASSUMPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS A MERE STANDARDIZED COG IN THE MACHINE BUT OWING TO THE CENTURIES OF DESPERATE SUFFERING THE PEOPLE HAD ENDURED AT THE HANDS OF THE HANS
WITH SOME STRUGGLES WE GOT INTO OUR SPECIAL AIR HELMETS AND ADJUSTED THE PRESSURE AT OUR SIGNAL GIBBONS EXHAUSTED THE AIR IN THE COMPARTMENT PUMPING IT INTO THE BODY OF THE SHIP AND AS THE LITTLE SIGNAL LIGHT FLASHED WILMA THREW OPEN THE HATCH
BUT CONCENTRATION WAS FORBIDDEN THE BIG BOSS NAMED THE SPOT ON THE HILLSIDE AS THE RALLYING POINT WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON BEING SEEN SO LONG AS WE DON'T GROUP HE DECLARED AT LEAST UNTIL WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE RALLYING SPOT
SPEAK IN ROTATION FROM BALD KNOB AROUND TO THE EAST NORTH WEST IN TURN THE MEN CALLED THEIR NAMES THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM I ASSIGNED THEM BY NAME TO COVER THE VARIOUS HAN SHIPS NUMBERING THE LATTER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
THEY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SHOOTING IT TO PIECES AND MASSACRING ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS IT SEEMED BARBAROUS TO ME BUT THEN I DID NOT HAVE CENTURIES OF BITTER PERSECUTION IN MY BLOOD
DIVIDE UP IN TRAINING ON THOSE REPELLOR RAYS YOU ON THE HILLTOPS ALL TRAIN ON THE REPELLORS OF THE SHIPS TO THE SOUTH SHOOT AT THE WORD BUT NOT BEFORE WILMA
I HAD KISSED WILMA GOOD BYE AT OUR CAMP AND AFTER A FINAL CONFERENCE OVER OUR PLANS WE BOARDED OUR CRAFT AND GENTLY GLIDED AWAY OVER THE TREE TOPS ON A COURSE WHICH AFTER CROSSING THREE ROUTES OF THE HAN SHIPS WOULD TAKE US OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC OFF THE JERSEY COAST
BUT NOW WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF MANNER MADAME DU LAUNY TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG GIRL THERE IS NO REASON HOWEVER WHY YOU SHOULD SUFFER FOR JANE'S MISDEEDS
YOU DON'T CALL THIS A FUSS REJOINED NORA ONLY A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING NOW IN SPITE OF HER OUTSPOKENNESS NORA WAS REALLY A VERY FAIR MINDED YOUNG PERSON OR PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY BECAUSE OF IT
WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
AS IF UNDERSTANDING HER PURPOSE THE LITTLE CREATURE LIMPED IN FRONT OF HER FOR A FEW STEPS BUT THE LIMP WAS SO SLIGHT AS TO ASSURE JULIA THAT NO SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAD BEFALLEN THE LEG WHICH THE DOG STILL SEEMED INCLINED TO HOLD OFF THE GROUND
ITS WALLS PANELED WITH MIRRORS WOULD REFLECT THE TABLES OF FANCY WORK IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE IT SEEM
BUT GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS AND BELLE'S GREAT GRIEVANCE WAS THAT WHEN FAWN BROWN FOR EXAMPLE WAS THE FASHIONABLE SPRING SHADE
I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
NO ANSWERED NORA STERNLY YOU MUST NOT BE SO SELFISH THERE MAY BE OLD LADIES WHO WILL WANT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT ANY OLD LADY WILL WANT THAT TOBACCO POUCH ASKED TOM WITH A MOST INNOCENT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE SHE MIGHT
SHE HAS LEARNED MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE I MAKE MISTAKES IN THESE BEASTLY OLD CONJUGATIONS THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME JEALOUSY IN THE FEELING OF FRANCES AND BELLE TOWARD JULIA BUT JEALOUSY WAS NOT A STRONG MOTIVE WITH BRENDA IN HER CASE
SHE ASKED EVERY MAIL HE ANSWERED BRINGS ME LETTERS FROM STRANGERS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE SOME CONTAIN POEMS IN MY HONOR AS SPECIMENS OF WHAT THE POET CAN DO
SHAPED LIKE A TINY SCIMITAR REALLY SHE THOUGHT I HAVE HAD A MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE BETTER THAN I DESERVE FOR IT WAS ONLY THIS AFTERNOON THAT I WAS FEELING SO CROSS AND SO DISHEARTENED BECAUSE THE FOUR WOULD NOT INCLUDE ME IN THE CLUB
SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT WITH HER FOR A DAY OR TWO WHILE FINDING THE OWNER O IF ONLY IT HAD NO OWNER WHAT JOY SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GAZED INTO ITS DARK EYES TO KEEP IT FOR MYSELF
WHILE MADAME DU LAUNY WAS SPEAKING JULIA SAID TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY SORRY TO BRING ON HERSELF A SCOLDING FROM SO SHARP VOICED AN OLD LADY AND SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING SORRY FOR JANE EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER HAD PROBABLY BEEN CARELESS
OR THREE CENTREPIECES FOR THE BAZAAR BUT I AM ALWAYS SO BUSY AT THIS SEASON YOU BUSY BELLE CRIED NORA WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING YOU ARE JUST THE IDLEST PERSON I KNOW INDEED I AM NOT
OR MUST HAVE SOMETHING OF HER MOTHER'S ALTERED TO THE PRESENT FASHION FOR GIRLS HOWEVER SKILFUL THE ALTERATIONS SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE IN SOME WAY DISGRACED NOW TO TELL THE TRUTH BELLE HERSELF HAD SO MUCH NATURAL TASTE THAT ONLY A VERY SEVERE CRITIC
AS TO FRANCES THOSE WHO KNEW HER BEST REALIZED THAT HER FAMILY PRIDE HAD BEEN NURTURED AT HOME AND THAT HER UNFORTUNATE WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS WAS NOT WHOLLY HER OWN FAULT YET THAT NORA HAD BEEN ABLE TO INFLUENCE HER SOMEWHAT WAS PROVED BY A SLIGHT CHANGE IN FRANCES DEMEANOR TOWARDS OTHERS
THE FOOTMAN PLACED IN HER HAND A LITTLE BOX WITH MADAME DU LAUNY'S COMPLIMENTS HE SAID THIS WHEN SHE OPENED
TO PREVENT THAT RUFFLING OF BRENDA'S FEELINGS WHICH WAS SURE TO FOLLOW WHEN SHE FELT THAT SOME ONE WAS LAUGHING AT HER
AS A MATTER OF FACT THESE WERE SENT ME BY AN UNFLEDGED POET WHO WISHED ME TO TELL HIM WHETHER HE WOULD STAND A CHANCE
SOME JUNIORS THAT I KNOW NEW YORK FELLOWS ARE COMING TO MORROW AND THEY WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED BRENDA
PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT I DO THINK ANSWERED FRANCES WE CAN'T MAKE INTIMATE FRIENDS OF EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD AND WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN OUR OWN SET I HATE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO PUSH IN IF YOU MEAN RUTH
AT LEAST I SHOULD JUDGE NOT BY THE NUMBERS OF COPIES OF VERSES THAT ARE SENT TO ME TO EXAMINE POETRY DEALS WITH COMMON HUMAN EMOTION
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE IN THE CEDAR CHESTS IN HER GRANDMOTHER'S ATTIC THERE WAS A STONE GREY THIBET AMPLE ENOUGH TO CUT OVER INTO A SPRING GOWN FOR HER AS TO HATS NEITHER HER MOTHER NOR HER GRANDMOTHER APPROVED OF HER HAVING HER HATS TRIMMED AT A MILLINER'S
THAT IS A GOOD OLD BOSTON NAME AND IF I MISTAKE NOT I USED TO KNOW YOUR GRANDFATHER AND THEN WHEN EDITH HAD SATISFIED HIM ON THIS POINT HE TURNED TO JULIA AND IN A BANTERING WAY SPOKE OF THE SERVICE SHE HAD DONE HIM THAT WINDY DAY
AND IN ADDITION TO THE CUT FLOWERS THAT WERE TO ARRIVE ON WEDNESDAY A GREAT MANY BEAUTIFUL POTTED PLANTS AND VINES HAD BEEN SENT IN FROM VARIOUS CONSERVATORIES FOR GENERAL DECORATIONS THE ONLY REAL WORK FOR THE BOYS WHO HAD COME TO ASSIST
SAW A COMPENSATION FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS LAST WEEK OR TWO IN THE FACT THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD SHOWN MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN SHE HAD GIVEN HER CREDIT FOR MISSUS BARLOW WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE GOOD SPIRIT THAT HER NIECE JULIA HAD SHOWN
FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE A NEW FRIEND AND IN A VERY UNEXPECTED WAY THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH SHE RODE HOME THOUGH OLD FASHIONED IN SHAPE WAS DELIGHTFULLY COMFORTABLE AND WHEN SHE DESCENDED FROM IT AT HER UNCLE'S DOOR STILL ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED HER
IT WAS A WINDY DAY IN EARLY JANUARY
OH I SUPPOSE YOU ARE RIGHT BRENDA ACKNOWLEDGED WITH A SIGH BUT I SHOULD BE EVER SO MUCH BETTER PLEASED WITH A HOTEL IT WOULD SEEM SO MUCH MORE AS IF WE WERE GROWN UP I HOPE THAT THIS WON'T SEEM LIKE A
AND THEN IN WHAT SEEMED AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME A MAN ENTERED WITH A BUTLER'S TRAY WHICH HE PLACED ON A TABLE IN FRONT OF MADAME DU LAUNY WHILE THE LATTER INVITED JULIA TO COME NEARER AND TAKE A CUP OF TEA NOW AS JULIA SAT THERE DRINKING TEA
IT WAS A BRIGHT CLEAR DAY AND SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD SOME OTHER GIRL TO WALK WITH HER FOR WHEN BY HERSELF SHE NEVER VENTURED BEYOND THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK ALTHOUGH IF HER COUSIN OR ONE OF HER SCHOOL FRIENDS COULD GO WITH HER
AS THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE BAZAAR ADVANCED IT WAS VERY PLEASANT FOR JULIA TO FIND HERSELF COUNTED IN AMONG THE BAND OF WORKERS IT IS TRUE THAT SHE OFTEN HAD TO TAKE A SHARP WORD FROM BRENDA
HER FAMILY HAS HAD POSITION FOR A LONG TIME AND ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION BUT AMONG YOUR SCHOOLMATES AND HERS THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER GIRLS OF GOOD DESCENT WHO HAVE HAD ADVANTAGES HARDLY INFERIOR TO THOSE
SEVEN OR EIGHT IN NUMBER WHICH HE COULD SEE FROM THAT WINDOW SOMERVILLE MEDFORD BELMONT ARLINGTON CHARLESTOWN BROOKLINE AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS PERHAPS
THE PUBLISHER QUOTES MERELY VERY CHARMING AND PRINTS THIS IN LARGE TYPE BOTH GIRLS SMILED AT THE EXPRESSION OF DROLL SORROW THAT CAME OVER THE POET'S FACE AS HE SPOKE AND I AM SO VERY UNFORTUNATE MYSELF HE ADDED
BUT WHAT IT WAS HE DID NOT SAY FOR AS EDITH TURNED HER EYES TOWARD AN OIL PAINTING ON THE WALL NEAR BY HE SAID
PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THIS A PROCEEDING WHICH THIS TIME DID NOT ANNOY BRENDA MISSUS BARLOW ADMIRED THE LITTLE BOOKS
HAD ADDED A DEEP BLUE BOW TO THE TRIMMING AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALTOGETHER SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WONDERS AT NORA'S SPEECH THE TEARS CAME TO HER EYES
WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
THEY MAKE A PRETTY FAIR SHOWING FOR ONE MAN BUT MY PUBLISHERS ARE GETTING READY TO BRING OUT A COMPLETE EDITION OF MY WORKS AND THAT WELL THAT MAKES ME REALIZE MY AGE AFTER A MOMENT AS IF REFLECTING HE ASKED QUICKLY
ANOTHER GUST AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO COMPOSE A NEW POEM TO TAKE THE PLACE
IN A MOMENT THE MAID HAD RETURNED AND ASKED THEM TO FOLLOW HER AT THE HEAD OF THE BROAD STAIRS THEY SAW THE POET HIMSELF STANDING TO MEET THEM WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND WHEN JULIA MENTIONED EDITH'S NAME AH
THE SURPRISE TABLE HAD BEEN AN IDEA OF BELLE'S AND WAS A RATHER AGREEABLE CHANGE FROM THE USUAL GRAB BAG ALL KINDS OF LITTLE THINGS TOYS NOVELTIES LIKE THOSE USED AS GERMAN FAVORS SMALL BOOKS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
IT IS TRUE THAT NEITHER BELLE NOR FRANCES WAS THOROUGHLY INFORMED AS TO JULIA'S INTENTIONS BUT THEY NEVER NEEDED VERY DEFINITE FACTS ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR THEORIES CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THEY WERE AT A LOSS FOR A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
YET THIS WAS JUST WHAT NORA DID A DAY OR TWO LATER WHEN SHE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE CRITICISMS SHE HAD MADE IN THE MATTER OF BELLE'S CLOTHES SHE WAS SURPRISED HERSELF AT THE GRACIOUSNESS WITH WHICH BELLE RECEIVED HER APOLOGY
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ENQUIRED THE PRACTICAL NORA WE CAN'T MAKE MUCH OUT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SELL
WHETHER TO BE CALLED CAP OR TURBAN IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AT OTHER TIMES WHAT SHE HAD CONSIDERED A GENUINE ADDITION TO THE STYLE OF HER GARMENT OR HAT TO OTHER EYES SEEMED ONLY QUEER OR IN SCHOOLGIRL PARLANCE WEIRD
THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU AND HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY IT WAS JUST FOR A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED
WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
I HOPE YOU DIVE WHERE THERE IS A SOFT BOTTOM SOMETIMES I DO AND SOMETIMES I DON'T ANSWERED THE SNAPPING TURTLE I CAN'T BOTHER TO SWIM DOWN SLOWLY AND TRY IT AND THEN GO BACK TO DIVE WHEN I WANT TO DIVE
THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
THE GREAT TIME FOR SINGING IS BEFORE THE EGGS ARE LAID THERE IS SOME SINGING AFTERWARD BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT IT OF US AND NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME WISH TO SING
AND WAS READY TO TALK IN THE MOST GRACIOUS WAY TO HIS NEIGHBORS THAT WAS ALL VERY WELL ANYBODY CAN BE GOOD NATURED WHEN EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND HE CAN HAVE HIS OWN WAY
HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
THEN THEY STOOD AND FISHED FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHEN SHE FLEW AWAY SHE SAID THAT IS A VERY PLEASANT FISHING PLACE HE STOOD ON THE OTHER LEG FOR A WHILE AND THOUGHT HOW SWEET HER VOICE SOUNDED AS SHE SAID IT
BUT THE REALLY DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PLEASANT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG IT WAS A MUD TURTLE FATHER WHO FIRST SPOKE TO HIM I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE THE POND SAID HE
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE OF ME SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE TO HIMSELF I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO HELP ME
HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
IF YOU WILL ONLY LEARN TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE SAID I SHALL NOT BE SORRY THAT THE BOYS CARRIED YOU OFF YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE SAID THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AFTER THAT
SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS NOW A FULLY GROWN FROG AND HAD SPRING WORK TO DO AND SHE SAID TO HIM
AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND NOW WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIDE AWAKE HE FELT EXCEEDINGLY DULL AND STUPID WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS EIGHT LEGS STUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
AND THEN SHE ADDED WHAT A COMFORT IT WILL BE IF ANY OF THEM ARE CROSS OR RUDE TO THINK
AND THERE ISN'T A LITTLE FISH IN THE POND WHO WOULD BE SEEN WITH YOU IF HE COULD HELP IT THEY ALL HIDE IF THEY SEE YOU COMING I'LL BE HEARTILY GLAD WHEN YOU GET YOUR WINGS AND FLY AWAY
WHEN THERE WAS NEED OF IT HE COULD TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS AND INDEED THAT VERY EVENING HE DID SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE EELS THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS TEACHING SOME YOUNG CRAYFISHES HIS PUPILS
BUT THEN I GET RIGHT OVER IT I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN MY LITTLE TALK WITH HIM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR TELLING HIM I AM SORRY HE IS VERY SILLY TO THINK SO MUCH OF IT HE LIFTED HIS BIG HEAD QUITE HIGH
TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
WHEN HE IS GOOD NATURED HE THINKS EVERYBODY ELSE OUGHT TO BE AND WHEN HE IS BAD TEMPERED HE DOESN'T CARE HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL
THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
EVEN THE FROGS WHO ARE AFRAID OF CRANES CREPT QUIETLY NEAR TO LOOK ON IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ANOTHER YOUNG CRANE BEGAN TO SKIP AND HOP AND CIRCLE AROUND DROOPING HIS WINGS AND WHOOPING AS HE WENT
ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
I SOMETIMES WONDER DOCTOR THAT YOU GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH MORE OR LESS IN YOUR HANDS DON'T TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND STAVE OFF NERVOUS PROSTRATION AND OTHER ILLS ATTENDANT UPON A RUN DOWN PHYSICAL CONDITION INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR A FULLY DEVELOPED CASE
I DON'T SEE THAT WE DOCTORS CAN DO ANYTHING TO MITIGATE THE EVIL EFFECTS OF THE CONSEQUENCES AB INITIO
IN THE PURCHASE OF A CAKE OF SOAP TO SEND TO ONE'S GRANDMOTHER AT CHRISTMAS
BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO AND I OBJECT TO THE NERVE OF THE BROAD GENERAL STATEMENT THAT IT IS SO SOMETIMES FIFTH THOUGHTS ARE BEST IN SCIENCE I GUESS YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MAN WHO THINKS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVENTH THOUGHT
WILL GO TO THE PIANO AND GIVE THE CHILD A DOSE OF HIAWATHA IF A SMALL BOY GOES SWIMMING AND CATCHES A COLD IN HIS HEAD AND IS DOWN WITH A FEVER HIS NURSE AN EXPERT ON THE ACCORDION
THE GENIAL IDIOT
YOU MISS THE WATER WHEN THE PIPES FREEZE UP DON'T YOU YOU OR RATHER I I SOMETIMES MISS THE WATER LIKE TIME AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AFTER A PLEASANT EVENING WITH SOME JOVIAL FRIENDS WHEN THERE'S NO END OF IT IN THE WELL
THAT THE MAXIMS AND PROVERBS OF OUR FOREFATHERS ARE LARGELY HOCUS POCUS AND BUNCOMBE I'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT MYSELF FROM THE MOMENT I HAD MY FIRST COPY BOOK LESSON IN WHICH I HAD TO SCRAWL THE LINE
I FORGET JUST HOW IT GOES WHAT TOMMY ROT THAT IS WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT MISTER IDIOT SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER TAPPING HIS FINGERS TOGETHER REFLECTIVELY
AT A MONDAY MARKED DOWN SALE OF LAUNDRY SOAP AND YEATS'S POEMS WHAT THE GOAL IS TO THE MAN THE BARGAIN IS TO THE WOMAN SO ON THE QUESTION OF INCENTIVE TO ACTION MISTER BRIEF THE SEXES ARE ABOUT EVEN
CERTAINLY SAID THE IDIOT HERE IS A LIST OF THEM AND AS HE ROSE UP TO DEPART HE HANDED MISTER BRIEF A PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS YOU NEVER FIND THE WATER TILL THE STOCK FALLS OFF TWENTY POINTS
AND WE LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP FOLLOW THIS LEADER AND GO BLATTING THAT SENTIMENT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES
SUDDENLY SOMEBODY PRESENTED ME WITH A COUPLE OF TICKETS FOR A PERFORMANCE OF PARSIFAL AND I WENT IT BEGAN AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON FOR TWENTY MINUTES ALL WENT SERENELY AND THEN THE MUSIC BEGAN TO WORK
WROTE IN HIS MESSAGE TO POSTERITY OH WHEN YOU COME TO CROWN MY BROW BRING ME NO BAY NOR SORREL GIVE ME NO PARSLEY WREATH BUT JUST THE LEGAL LONG GREEN LAUREL I NEVER HEARD THAT POEM BEFORE LAUGHED THE POET
AND DICK DAVIS WAS THE REAL AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE WHY DON'T YOU PUBLISH THE THING OVER YOUR OWN NAME TOO MODEST SAID THE IDIOT
THE CRICKETS CRY ALL TELL US THAT IT IS JULY
WHY NOT ADAPT THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS TO MODERN CONDITIONS
IT WAS TRUE THE GREAT AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY AND WAS GRADUALLY DARKENING I PUT ON MY HAT AND WALKED OUT REFRESHED HAVING SLEPT FROM FIVE TWENTY UNTIL TWELVE OR SIX HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES STRAIGHT
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHERS AND THE WAY THEY REFUTE ONE ANOTHER IS TO ME A CONSTANT SOURCE OF DELIGHT SAID THE IDIOT THERE'S PROCRASTINATION IS THE THIEF OF TIME FOR INSTANCE
AND THE CANDIDATE WHO TURNS HIS BACK ON THE INFANT MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP THE RACE I KNOW BECAUSE A COUSIN OF MINE RAN FOR SUPERVISOR ONCE AND HE WAS LICKED OUT OF HIS BOOTS BECAUSE HE TRIED TO DO HIS KISSING BY PROXY
SIMILARLY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WHEN THE DAILY FLIM FLAM ASSERTS THAT HE BELIEVES THAT THE WORKING MAN IS ENTITLED TO FOUR CENTS A DAY FOR SIXTEEN HOURS WORK
AND THAT BEING THE CASE IT ISN'T WORTH DOING WHEN LAWYERS CAN WRITE AS GOOD POETRY AS REAL POETS IT DOESN'T PAY TO BE A REAL POET I'M GOING IN FOR SOMETHING ELSE I GUESS I'LL APPLY FOR A JOB AS A MOTORMAN AND MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF THERE
INSTEAD OF TAKING A MEDICINE CHEST ALONG WITH THEM WILL BE PROVIDED WITH A MUSIC BOX WITH CYLINDERS FOR MUMPS MEASLES SUMMER COMPLAINT WHOOPING COUGH CHICKEN POX CHILLS AND FEVER AND ALL THE OTHER ILLS THE FLESH IS HEIR TO
PLACE NO SALAD ON MY HEAD WHEN YOU BRING THE BAY GIVE ME NOT THE WATER CRESSES TO ADORN MY FLOWING TRESSES BUT AT E'EN CROWN MY POCKETS GOOD AND STRONG WITH THE GREEN THE GREEN THAT'S LONG
AND PROVOKES A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT MIRTH YOU DON'T YOURSELF BELIEVE THAT LAST YARN ABOUT THE PROHIBITION CANDIDATE DO YOU I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY YARN ABOUT HIM SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT HE IS THE OWNER OF A BREWERY UP IN ROCHESTER
OUGHT TO BE WARNED BEFOREHAND YOU WOULDN'T YOURSELF RENT A FURNISHED RESIDENCE TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BUILT BONFIRES IN THE PARLOR OF THEIR LAST KNOWN HOME WOULD YOU I THINK NOT SMILED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
THAT WE MAY NOT SO SUMMARILY DISMISS TAKE FOR INSTANCE YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE WELL RUNS DRY ONE OF THE WORST OF THE LOT MISTER WHITECHOKER SAID THE IDIOT I'VE MISSED THE WATER LOTS OF TIMES WHEN THE WELL WAS FULL AS EVER
THAT'S WHERE THE WIND WHISTLES IF NATURE WHISTLES ANYWHERE
AND TRYING TO CURE IT AFTER THE FACT THE OUNCE OF PREVENTION IDEA OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED IT SEEMS TO ME INTO THE MATERIA MEDICA WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO MOVE MOUNTAINS DEMANDED THE DOCTOR
NOW THE TROMBONE IS A TOOTING OUT ITS SCALEY SHUTE THE CHUTEING AND THE OBOE IS HOBOING WITH A ZEST NOW THE DRESSMAKERS ARE WORKING NOT A SINGLE MINUTE SHIRKING
I SAW THAT SAME ITEM AND SEVERAL OTHERS BESIDES AND I HAVE ONLY TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITIES OF MUSIC AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRUGS
WHY HIS SHIRT IS WET HIS FIRST THOUGHT IS NATURALLY
THAT'S A FAIR DIVISION BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY PROPOSITION WELL IT'S CERTAINLY ER CHEEKY ENOUGH SAID THE POET DO I UNDERSTAND IT YOU WANT ME TO FATHER YOUR POEMS TO TELL THE TRUTH
AND A HUNDRED NOVEL WAYS OF COOKING PRUNES NOW THE PUMPKIN GOES A PUMPKING THROUGH THE FIELDS AND THE MERRY VISAGED COWS ARE CHEWING CUD AND THE PROFITS THAT THE PLUMBER'S BUSINESS YIELDS
I THIRST FOR LAURELS SAID THE IDIOT
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THAT STORY HAS BEEN PUT FORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF TURNING THE MAIDEN AUNT NEGRO AND GRANDFATHER VOTES AGAINST HIM YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE EITHER NEVER DID WHAT IS CHARGED AGAINST HIM
WOODS WERE MADE FOR WHISTLING AND ANY MAN WHO EVER SAT OVER A BIG LOG FIRE IN CAMP OR IN LIBRARY WHO HAS NOT NOTICED THAT THE LOGS THEMSELVES WHISTLE CONSTANTLY WELL HE IS A PACHYDERM
A COLLEGE PRESIDENT MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT BOYS WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO STAVE OFF THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF PLAYING THE GAME TO ONE WHO ISN'T PREPARED FOR IT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANYBODY ELSE THAT FROM NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TO DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH
WHO SPENT HIS LIFE LOOKING FOR AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT EVERY FOUR YEARS THAT HE COULD SPOT HIM INSTANTLY BY MERELY COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AND TAKING HIS CHOICE FROM AMONG THE SEVERAL CANDIDATES
AND HAS REPEATEDLY AVOWED THAT BREAD AND WATER IS THE PROPER FOOD FOR MOTORMEN EVERYBODY WITH COMMON SENSE REALIZES AT ONCE THAT EVEN THE FLIM FLAM DOESN'T BELIEVE THE STORY IT HURTS NO ONE THEREFORE
THAN IN THE ORIGINAL MODEL THE LEG THAT'S NEVER PULLED DOESN'T GO SHORT IN A STRINGENT FINANCIAL MARKET AND A COURTSHIP WITHOUT A KISS EVEN IF IT LASTED ONLY FIVE MINUTES
THE FELLOW WHO DOES THAT MISTER BIB WANTS TO LEAD A DOUBLE LIFE AND THAT IS REPREHENSIBLE THE MAN WHO OFFERS HIMSELF TO THE PEOPLE HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO TIE A STRING TO ANY PART OF HIM
THAT THE SUMMER TIME HAS GONE WITH ALL ITS HEAT AND THE CRISP AND FROSTY WINTER DAYS ARE HERE YOU SEE MISTER POET THAT OUT OF THAT ONE IDEA ALONE THAT CATALOGUING OF THE THINGS OF THE FOUR SEASONS YOU CAN GET FOUR POEMS
SAID HE'D GIVE THE KISSES IN A BUNCH TO A COMMITTEE OF YOUNG LADIES WHO COULD DISTRIBUTE THEM FOR HIM RESULT WAS EVERYBODY WAS DOWN ON HIM EVEN THE YOUNG LADIES I GUESS HE WAS A COUSIN OF YOURS ALL RIGHT LAUGHED THE DOCTOR
AND RENDER HOMAGE TO THE ANCESTORS OF THE PHARAOH IN SUCH A GRIEVOUS TIME THE SUPREME COUNCIL COMMANDED ME TO WEAR THIS HOLY RELIC SO THAT THE ORDER OF THE STATE AND THE SERVICE OF THE GODS MIGHT NOT BE NEGLECTED
WAS NOT NOW THE VICE PHARAOH AT THAT MOMENT HE HEARD A LOW RUSTLE AMONG THE TREES AND DELICATE HANDS RESTED ON HIS SHOULDER WELL SARAH ASKED THE PRINCE WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD THOU ART SAD MY LORD
SO AS NOT TO MEET HERHOR OR ANNOY HIS OWN MOTHER WHOM HE CONSIDERED THE CAUSE OF HIS FAILURES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY TUTMOSIS VISITED HIM IN THIS RETREAT BRINGING TWO BOATS FILLED WITH MUSICIANS AND DANCERS AND A THIRD CONTAINING BASKETS OF FOOD AND FLOWERS
AND SEEN THE GREEN EYES OF WOLVES BUT I DID NOT FLEE FOR WHITHER WAS I THE UNFORTUNATE TO FLEE WHEN AT EVERY PATH TERROR WAS LURKING AND IN THIS CANAL FREEDOM HELD ME BACK BY THE FEET ONCE BEYOND THAT TURN THERE
TO THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE STATE MORE POWERFUL PERHAPS
THERE IS A HOSTILE CORPS I MUST TAKE TWO CORPS TO BEAT IT IF THE ENEMY IS IN A DEFENSIVE POSITION I SHOULD NOT MOVE WITHOUT THREE CORPS WHEN THE ENEMY IS UNDISCIPLINED AND FIGHTS IN UNORDERED CROWDS AGAINST A THOUSAND
AND SEIZES WITH HIS EAR THE RUSTLE OF THE CURTAIN LEST TREASON OVERTURN HIM IN HIS OWN TENT FOR THIS REASON MEN'S HEARTS IN ALL PLACES AND AT ALL TIMES ARE OVERFLOWING WITH SADNESS IN THE DESERT THE LION AND THE SCORPION ARE HIS DANGER
EGYPT CONTINUED TO DEVELOP WHILE A PEOPLE OF ONE COMPOSITION ENERGETIC KINGS
OR CANST THOU BRING ALL SUBJECTS OF HIS HOLINESS TO THINK AND FEEL AS I HIS MOST DEVOTED SUBJECT SARAH DROPPED HER HANDS ON HER KNEES AND WHISPERED SADLY TRUE I CANNOT DO THOSE THINGS I CAN DO NOTHING
WITH PITCHERS OF WINE BUT THE PRINCE COMMANDED THE MUSICIANS AND DANCERS TO DEPART AND TAKING TUTMOSIS TO THE GARDEN HE SAID OF COURSE MY MOTHER MAY SHE LIVE THROUGH ETERNITY SENT THEE TO SEPARATE ME FROM THE JEWESS
AND HENS WILL LAY EGGS IN YOUR HELMETS SUCH IS THE FATE WAITING FOR STUPID SOLDIERS WHO KNOW NOT HOW TO KEEP THEIR TONGUES QUIET AND NOW TO THE LEFT TO THE REAR TURN AND MARCH TO THE BOAT MAY THE PLAGUE STRIKE YOU
BUT IT IS NOT WISE TO BRING THEM TO DESPAIR THROUGH SEVERITY BESIDES THINK OF THIS WHO WILL REPLACE THEM IN COUNSEL THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN THAT IS AND THAT WILL BE ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN THEY KNOW THE MOST SECRET THOUGHTS OF MANKIND
HE RAN TO THE LITTER THEREFORE KNELT DOWN AND STRUCK THE SAND WITH HIS FOREHEAD WHAT DOST THOU WISH MAN ASKED THE DIGNITARY O LIGHT OF THE SUN LISTEN TO ME CRIED THE SLAVE MAY THERE BE NO GROANS IN THY CHAMBER
THE EGYPTIANS IN THE DAYS OF THEIR GREATNESS FORMED AS IT WERE ONE PERSON IN WHICH THE PRIESTLY ORDER PERFORMED THE ROLE OF MIND THE PHARAOH WAS THE WILL THE PEOPLE FORMED THE BODY AND OBEDIENCE GAVE COHESION
ASKED HER SON WITH A BITTER SMILE MEN HAVE WITNESSED THE DEATH OF PHARAOHS WHO HAD REIGNED A FEW MONTHS ONLY AND THE FALL OF DYNASTIES WHICH HAD GOVERNED NINE NATIONS YES FOR THOSE PHARAOHS FORGOT THE SWORD FOR THE DISTAFF
AND DOST THOU UNDERSTAND THEM PARDON MOST WORTHY LORD BUT COULD I MANAGE A PROVINCE IF I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRINCE WAS CONFUSED AND FELL TO THINKING
WAS A HIGH PRIEST AND POSSESSED EXTENSIVE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PHARAOH AND MY FATHER IS A PHARAOH ALSO I CANNOT ENDURE THE RULE OF HERHOR
AND WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH A PERFECT CONTROL OVER LABOR BY INTELLECT WHILE THIS CONTROL WAS EXERTED EVEN APPROXIMATELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATION'S HISTORICAL CALLING IT WAS EFFECTUAL AND ALSO UNCHALLENGED
MEANWHILE THY TREASURER STINTS US IN ALLOWANCE AND WOULD DEPRIVE US OF SERVING MAIDS WITHOUT WHOM WE CANNOT BATHE OR DRESS OUR HAIR RAMESES SUMMONED HIS TREASURER AND COMMANDED STERNLY
I EXAMINE THE NOMARCHS I LOOK AT THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE I LISTEN TO REPORTS OF SCRIBES BUT I UNDERSTAND NOTHING THIS POISONS MY LIFE AND ASTOUNDS ME WHEN I HAVE TO DO WITH THE ARMY
CRIED THE VICEROY DID NOT THE NOMARCHS ENTERTAIN US ALL THE WAY YES BUT WE PAID THEM FOR DOING SO THEN THEY ARE ROGUES AND ROBBERS IF THEY RECEIVE US AS GUESTS AND THEN PLUNDER US BE NOT ANGRY AND I WILL EXPLAIN
AND A MULTITUDE OF BLUE VEINS ON ITS HEAD THESE ARE CANALS WHICH CUT THROUGH THE DELTA IN MARCH THE BLUE LINE WOULD BE NARROWER AND THE BODY OF THE SERPENT BECAUSE OF RIPENING GRAIN
BY HIS OFFICE THE PHARAOH WAS LAWGIVER SUPREME KING HIGHEST JUDGE CHIEF PRIEST
AND EVEN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN THE SAVAGES OF CENTRAL EUROPE WORE UNTANNED SKINS FOR CLOTHING AND WERE CAVE DWELLERS EGYPT HAD A HIGH SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AGRICULTURE CRAFTS AND LITERATURE
SAID EUNANA WITH A PATRONIZING TONE TO THE GREEK SOLDIERS WHO BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE SLAVE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS SPEECH BUT THE TONE OF IT ARRESTED THEM THEY ARE FILLING IN ALL THE TIME SAID THE SLAVE WITH RISING FEAR WOE TO THEE
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THAT HE LOOKS ON ME AS IF I HAD COME TO MEASURE OUT PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THOU HAST THE FACE OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN ASSOCIATING WITH DIVINITY HE SPOKE TRUTH
THE WORTHY LADY LAUGHED THOU ART SPEAKING LIKE SOME BOY FROM A PRIMARY SCHOOL ANSWERED SHE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS AND HAST FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OF RAMESES THE GREAT THE YELLOW PEOPLE ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN WE AND THEY ARE RICHER
HE TOOK PART IN THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE BUT WAS CAPTURED AND LIBERATED AFTER SOME MONTHS DETENTION AS A STUDENT HE SHOWED NOTABLE POWER AND WAS EXCEPTIONALLY ATTRACTED BY MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE
MY LIFE HAS PASSED WITHOUT PAIN WITHOUT FEAR LIKE A CALM EVENING ON THE JORDAN BUT HOW MANY ARE THERE WHO MOISTEN THEIR BREAD WITH TEARS DAILY AND WHOSE HOUSES ARE FILLED WITH SIGHING A WAIL IS MAN'S EARLIEST SPEECH ON THIS EARTH
THY PROVINCE WORTHINESS IS AMONG THE RICHEST IN EGYPT IS IT NOT YES
AND CREATURES SUCH AS THESE THOUGHT THE PRINCE AS HE LOOKED AT THEIR TOIL DESIRE ME TO REALIZE THEIR IMAGININGS WHAT CHANGE IN THE STATE CAN THEY WISH IS IT THAT HE WHO DRAWS FROM THE LOWEST WELL SHOULD GO TO THE HIGHEST
CUT OUT OF IVORY AND EACH OF THOSE DANCERS HAS SOME DEFECT SOME ARE TOO THICK OTHERS HAVE THIN LEGS OR UGLY HANDS STILL OTHERS HAVE FALSE HAIR WHO OF THEM IS LIKE THEE IF THOU WERT AN EGYPTIAN
RAMESES GLANCED INTO HIS MILD AND HONEST FACE AND INQUIRED SUDDENLY WHO AND WHAT ART THOU WORTHINESS MY NAME IS SEM
RETORTED RAMESES HE BOWED AND WENT OUT IN PROPORTION AS THE SOUND OF RAMESES STEPS GREW LESS IN THE IMMENSE ANTECHAMBER THE FACE OF THE WORTHY LADY CHANGED THE PLACE OF MAJESTY WAS TAKEN BY PAIN AND FEAR
BUT HAST THOU NOT PERMITTED ME TO CHOOSE MY SERVANTS THAT IS TRUE AND SO ALSO THE OVERSEER OF THE WORKMEN IS A JEW FOR HE HAS A YELLOW COMPLEXION AND LOOKS WITH A LOWLINESS WHICH NO EGYPTIAN COULD IMITATE
WHILE EGYPT IS EGYPT NO RULER HAS GAINED WISDOM OF STATE IN ANOTHER WAY I WILL MEDITATE OVER THIS SAID THE PRINCE THOUGH I SEE FROM THY WORDS THAT THE MOST VENERABLE
LIKE TWO ROWS OF COLUMNS COVERED WITH GLITTERING ARMOR AFTER THE MESSENGER WENT PATROKLES IN A HELMET WITH PLUMES WEARING A PURPLE TUNIC OVER WHICH HE HAD GILDED ARMOR ORNAMENTED ON THE BREAST WITH THE PICTURE OF A WOMAN'S HEAD BRISTLING WITH SERPENTS INSTEAD OF HAIR
AND THE WHITE EUROPEAN THIS COLOR OF SKIN WHICH ENABLED THEM TO DISTINGUISH THEIR OWN PEOPLE FROM STRANGERS HELPED TO KEEP UP THE NATION'S UNITY MORE STRICTLY THAN RELIGION WHICH A MAN MAY ACCEPT OR LANGUAGE WHICH HE MAY APPROPRIATE
NO CHANGES COULD COME SAVE FROM THAT PLACE THERE BURNED THE ONLY VISIBLE LAMP OF POLITICAL WISDOM THE LIGHT OF WHICH ILLUMINATED EGYPT BUT TOUCHING THAT LIGHT IT WAS SAFER TO BE SILENT
HERHOR I BEG THEE TO EXPLAIN ONE THING WHICH FILLS MY HEART WITH ANXIETY SHALL I BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ASKED THE PROPHET THOU WILT ANSWER ME FOR THOU ART FILLED WITH WISDOM OF WHICH THOU ART THE SERVANT
THEY ARE THE MOST FAITHFUL SERVANTS THANKS TO THEIR PRAYERS THY FATHER REIGNS THIRTY THREE YEARS AND AVOIDS WAR WHICH MIGHT BE FATAL TO THE PRIESTS TO THE PHARAOH AND THE STATE INTERRUPTED THE LADY
BUT A HUNDRED TALENTS WHERE COULD I FIND WEALTH LIKE THAT NEITHER IN EGYPT NOR PHOENICIA CONTINUED HE SOBBING SET HAS SEIZED THEE O DAGON
AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE ARMY ASKED THE PRINCE RUBBING HIS FOREHEAD IMPATIENTLY PUT AWAY THE JEWESS AND BEG THE PRIESTS PERHAPS THEY WILL MAKE A LOAN TO THEE NEVER
YOU MAY SPEAK YOUR MIND FREELY THEN MY MIND AIR THET THE MAN WHO HEZ DUD THIS MURDER AIN'T MAURICE THE MOWSTANGER THAT'S MY OWN BELIEF YOU KNOW IT ALREADY HAVE YOU NOTHING MORE TO COMMUNICATE
HE MIGHT CAPTURE THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN AND ASCERTAIN FROM HIM THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF HIS WILD WANDERINGS WHILE THUS ABSORBED IN CONSIDERING WHAT COURSE HE HAD BEST TAKE HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PUFF OF SMOKE AND THE REPORT HEARD FAR OFF OVER THE PRAIRIE
AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
THERE IS NO SIGN OF IT ON THE FACES THAT SURROUND HIM STILL SOLEMNLY AUSTERE
ASSEMBLED IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE HOTEL MOST WERE IN MILITARY GARB SINCE IN ADDITION TO THE OFFICERS WHO HAD LATELY FIGURED INSIDE THE SALOON OTHERS ALONG WITH SUCH SOLDIERS AS WERE PERMITTED TO PASS THE SENTRIES
IF THE RIDER DOES NOT FEEL THE INDIGNITY THE STEED DOES AND RESISTS IT BY REARING UPWARD WITH A FIERCE NEIGHING THAT FRIGHTS THE VULTURES OFF
FORTUNATELY I DID NOT GO SO FAR I HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE BEING CALLED WORSE THAN FOOL THOUGH PERHAPS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAY OBTAIN FORGIVENESS FOR MY FAULT AT ALL EVENTS I INTEND TO TRY FOR IT
A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
AND THEN STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD WITH A SADDLED HORSE FOLLOWING CLOSE AFTER HIM THE MAN HAD A PANAMA HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND A CLOAK THROWN LOOSELY AROUND HIS SHOULDERS THIS DID NOT HINDER CALHOUN FROM RECOGNISING HIS COUSIN HENRY
IT WAS CAUSED BY AN OBSTRUCTION A PATCH OF IMPENETRABLE THICKET THEY MET AGAIN BUT NOT TILL THAT ON WHICH THE HUNTER WAS RETURNING STRAGGLED OFF INTO AN OPEN GLADE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE HAVING BECOME SATISFIED OF THIS ZEB LOOKED AROUND INTO THE GLADE
SOME OF THE MORE FEARLESS LOOKING IN BEHELD A STRANGE SCENE THEY SAW TWO MEN LYING PROSTRATE ON THE PLANK FLOOR BOTH WITH BLOODSTAINED HABILIMENTS BOTH EVIDENTLY DISABLED
IS THAT IN WHICH THE COOK IS BROILING HER SKIN IN THE KITCHEN AS THE LAGGARD OR LATE RISER MAY HAVE TO PUT UP WITH COLD BISCUIT AND NO WAFFLES OR BUCKWHEAT CAKES THERE ARE FEW SUCH ON A SOUTHERN PLANTATION
ROUGHLY TEARING HIS REIN FROM THE BRANCH AND PASSING IT OVER HIS HORSE'S HEAD
THE BREAKFAST OF THE SOUTH WESTERN AMERICAN IS USUALLY A WELL APPOINTED MEAL IT IS EATEN AT A FIXED HOUR AND TABLE D'HOTE FASHION ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MEETING AT THE TABLE THIS HABIT IS EXACTED BY A SORT OF NECESSITY
HIS LATE DEFEAT HAD RENDERED HIM FEARFUL OF CHANCING A SECOND ENCOUNTER WITH THE SAME ADVERSARY EVEN UNDER THE ADVANTAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SURPRISE
HOUND FRANTICALLY HISSED OUT THE CHIVALRIC SOUTHERNER LOW DOG OF AN IRISH DAM I'LL SEND YOU HOWLING TO YOUR KENNEL I'LL SHAME CAPTAIN CALHOUN INTERRUPTED THE MAJOR SECONDED BY OTHER VOICES
ARE YOU SURE ASKED THE PLANTER SERIOUSLY STIRRED BY THE INTELLIGENCE SATIN SHOO MASS WOODLEY
ONLY THEM AS AIR LIKE TO TAKE IT INTO THUR OWN HANDS
CALHOUN POSSESSED GOLD MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
AND THEM MADE BY ONLY TWO HORSES THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT
IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
WHO ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NEVER HAVE LOOKED UPON THE GREAT OCEAN ARE NEVERTHELESS AU FAIT TO ITS PHRASEOLOGY BY THE TIMBER ISLAND IN QUESTION ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM ITS EDGE A HORSE IS QUIETLY PASTURING HE IS THE SAME THAT CARRIES THE HEADLESS RIDER
THERE MUST BE BEFORE DAYBREAK IN THE MORNING AS CALHOUN CONCLUDED THIS STRING OF STRANGE REFLECTIONS HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF ANOTHER SHANTY THAT OF THE MEXICAN MUSTANGER
THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
CONCLUSIVELY DECLARED THE MAJOR MAKING FOR ONE OF THE DOORS THAT LED OUTWARD INTO THE SQUARE MEIN GOTT MAJOR SCREAMED THE GERMAN BONIFACE RUSHING OUT FROM BEHIND HIS BAR WHERE UP TO THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN STANDING TRANSFIXED WITH FEAR
AND TOOK IT OFF WITH THE DESIGN TO EXAMINE IT HIS OBJECT WAS SIMPLY TO OBTAIN SOME EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY OR SERIES OF MYSTERIES
SUCH WAS THE TABLEAU THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE SPECTATORS AS THE SULPHUROUS SMOKE DRIFTED OUT BY THE CURRENT BETWEEN THE TWO DOORS GAVE THEM A CHANCE OF DISTINGUISHING OBJECTS WITHIN THE SALOON
I AM NOT CERTAIN AS TO THE EXACT YEAR THE UNIT OF IT THOUGH I CAN WITH UNQUESTIONABLE CERTAINTY RECORD THE DECADE I CAN SPEAK MORE PRECISELY AS TO THE PLACE THOUGH IN THIS I MUST BE ALLOWED LATITUDE
AS IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN SLAKED OVER THEM THIS WAS SEEN BOTH ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE HORSE AND THE FLAP OF THE SADDLE OF COURSE IT WAS THE BODY OF THE RIDER AS IT SLIPPED LIFELESS TO THE EARTH THERE WERE SOME WHO SPOKE WITH EQUAL CERTAINTY AS TO THE TIME
IT WAS THE NAME OF LOUISE'S BROTHER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT THE EX OFFICER OF VOLUNTEERS WHEN STRETCHED UPON A SICK BED RECEIVED LESS SYMPATHY FROM HIS RELATIVES
HA HA HA SURELY YOU ARE JOKING NO I'M IN EARNEST IF YOU COME ALONG WITH ME YOU SHALL SEE THEN I SAY AGAIN YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY MAD BUT A DAMNED NATURAL BORN IDIOT
ITS FAME ALREADY REACHED ON ONE SIDE TO THE RIO GRANDE
ONLY FAR ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT A MAN HAS BEEN MURDERED WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU OF WHAT YOU SAY IS THERE A DEAD BODY NO NOT AS MUCH AS THE LITTLE FINGER NOT EVEN A HAIR OF THE HEAD SO FUR AS I CAN SEE WHAT THEN BLOOD A REGULAR POOL OF IT
THE MUSTANGER ANTICIPATING THIS ACTION HAD ARMED HIMSELF WITH A SIMILAR WEAPON AND STOOD READY TO RETURN THE FIRE OF HIS ANTAGONIST SHOT FOR SHOT THE MORE TIMID OF THE SPECTATORS HAD ALREADY COMMENCED MAKING THEIR ESCAPE OUT OF DOORS TUMBLING OVER ONE ANOTHER
NO ANOTHER SIGNAL HAD BEEN AGREED UPON AND IT WAS GIVEN A STENTORIAN VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING OUT THE SIMPLE MONOSYLLABLE
FOR THE TESTIMONY OF GERALD HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY A SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD BODY THE SURGEON OF THE CANTONMENT HAS PRONOUNCED THE TWO DISTINCT AND THAT HENRY POINDEXTER'S DEATH
STILL AS ZEB CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON IT HE FANCIED HE HAD SEEN THAT HAT BEFORE AND ON SOME OTHER HEAD IT WAS NOT FROM ANY SUSPICION OF ITS BEING HONESTLY IN POSSESSION OF HIM NOW WEARING IT THAT THE HUNTER STOOPED DOWN
I SHA'N'T OBJECT TO ANYTHING THAT'S FAIR ASSENTED THE IRISHMAN DEVIL A BIT I SHALL FIGHT WITH THE WEAPON I HOLD IN MY HAND DOGGEDLY DECLARED CALHOUN AGREED THE VERY WEAPON FOR ME WAS THE REJOINDER OF HIS ADVERSARY
NOT AS IF FROM FEAR BUT LIKE A RUNNER ABOUT TO MAKE A START AND STRAINING UPON THE SPRING BOTH WERE LOOKING INWARDS INTO THE SALOON WHERE NO SOUND COULD BE HEARD SAVE THE TICKING OF A CLOCK
AH MISTER STUMP GLAD TO SEE YOU SO SOON HAVE YOU MADE ANY DISCOVERY IN THIS QUEER AFFAIR FROM YOUR QUICK RETURN I CAN ALMOST SAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING I HOPE IN FAVOUR OF THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNG FELLOW
COME MISTER CALHOUN SAID THE MAJOR IN A SOOTHING TONE SIX SHOTS OUGHT TO SATISFY ANY REASONABLE MAN WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO THE STEEL BEFORE YOU FINISH FIRING ONE OR THE OTHER OF YOU DAMN THE KNIFE INTERRUPTED CALHOUN UNBUTTONING HIS COAT
I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF MAURICE THE MUSTANGER
DEAD PRONOUNCED THE TRACKER DEAD BEFORE THAT BLOOD HAD TURNED PURPLE AS IT IS NOW WHOSE DO YOU THINK IT IS SPANGLER THAT OF THE MAN WE'RE IN SEARCH OF THE SON OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN DOWN THERE THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WISH HIM TO COME FORWARD HE MAY AS WELL KNOW THE WORST
WHILE THE ARMAS DE AGUA STRAPPED OVER HIS LIMBS COVER THEM FROM THIGH TO SPUR CONCEALING ALL BUT THEIR OUTLINES HIS BODY IS BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AS IF TO EASE THE HORSE IN GETTING HIS SNOUT TO THE SWARD WHICH THE LONG BRIDLE REIN SURRENDERED TO ITS FULL LENGTH ENABLES HIM TO DO
WITH BENT HEAD HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND SOUGHT THE HOSPITALITY OF ROMANIANUS NO SOONER HAD HE GONE THAN MONICA'S HEART MELTED THE MOTHER LOVE SURGED UP AGAIN WITH BITTER TEARS SHE CRIED ON GOD TO HELP HER HER GRIEF SEEMED GREATER THAN SHE COULD BEAR
GREAT HOPE HAS DAWNED WROTE AUGUSTINE THE CATHOLIC FAITH TEACHES NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT AND VAINLY ACCUSED IT OF LIFE IS VAIN DEATH UNCERTAIN IF IT STEALS UPON US OF A SUDDEN IN WHAT STATE SHALL WE DEPART HENCE
HE HAD KNOWN HIM WELL IN ROME AUGUSTINE WAS INTERESTED HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY HE SAID VICTORINUS SAID THE OLD MAN WAS A PAGAN AND A WORSHIPPER OF THE HEATHEN GODS
WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN A RITE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT TO EVERYBODY'S SURPRISE THE YOUNG MAN RECOVERED HIS SENSES AND BEGAN TO MEND AUGUSTINE THEN LAUGHINGLY TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING AND WENT ON TO MAKE FUN OF THE WHOLE PROCEEDING NEVER DOUBTING
UNSELFISH GOD HAD WORK FOR MONICA TO DO IN HIS WORLD AS HE HAS FOR US ALL IF WE WILL ONLY DO IT AND HE HAD GIVEN HER WHAT WAS NEEDFUL FOR HER TASK THAT NIGHT ON THE WAY TO HER CHAMBER
TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
THAT WE ARE MADE UP OF SOUL AND BODY TO THIS EVERYBODY AGREED BUT NAVIGIUS WHO WAS INCLINED TO ARGUE AND WHO SAID HE DID NOT KNOW DO YOU MEAN ASKED AUGUSTINE THAT THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL THAT YOU DO KNOW
THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
MANY MEN OF NOTE JOINED HIS SCHOOL AND HIS NAME BEGAN TO BE FAMOUS HE GREATLY DESIRED HONOUR HE TELLS US BUT ONLY IF HONOURABLY WON ONE DAY A CERTAIN MAGICIAN PAID HIM A VISIT
IT WAS HER ONLY HOPE NOW AS WITH PRAYERS AND TEARS SHE BESOUGHT OF HIM TO WATCH OVER HER SON BUT MONICA DID NOT KNOW CARTHAGE
THEIR SOULS MIGHT BE FED ALSO
MONICA THOUGH FULL OF LIFE AND SPIRIT HAD COMMON SENSE AND JUDGMENT BEYOND HER YEARS SHE HAD ALSO A GREAT LOVE OF GOD AND OF ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIS HOLY SERVICE
THE PAGANISM OF THE FOURTH CENTURY WITH ITS MOTTO LET US EAT DRINK AND BE MERRY IMPOSED NO SELF DENIAL IT WAS THEREFORE BOUND TO BE POPULAR BUT UNRESTRAINED HUMAN NATURE IS A DANGEROUS THING
AN OLD WOMAN AND A YOUNG GIRL SAT TOGETHER LOOKING OUT INTO THE DARK SHADOWS OF THE EVENING FOR THE HOT AFRICAN SUN HAD SUNK NOT LONG SINCE BEHIND THE NUMIDIAN MOUNTAINS AND THE DAY HAD GONE OUT LIKE A LAMP
WHO REMAINED AMONGST THEM FOR NINE YEARS THUS DESCRIBES THEM WHEN WRITING TO A FRIEND THOU KNOWEST HONORATUS THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE DID WE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THESE MEN
AND PRAY FOR THEM ALL THE MORE EARNESTLY OFFERING HER SUFFERINGS FOR THESE POOR SOULS WHO WERE SO FAR FROM THE PEACE OF CHRIST HOW WAS THE LIGHT TO COME TO THEM IF NOT THROUGH HER HOW COULD THEY LEARN TO LOVE CHRIST UNLESS THEY LEARNED TO LOVE HIS SERVANTS
SHE TOOK AS KINDLY AN INTEREST IN THE SLAVES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN OF HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD AND WOULD EVEN INTERCEDE TO SPARE THEM A BEATING SHE LIKED THE POOR AND WOULD GATHER THESE DIRTY AND UNPLEASANT PEOPLE ABOUT HER
CAN WE CALL A MAN WHO WANTS MONEY NEEDY AND NOT CALL HIM SO WHEN HE WANTS WISDOM AT THIS REMARK THERE WAS A GENERAL OUTCRY OF ADMIRATION IT WAS THE VERY ARGUMENT SAID AUGUSTINE THAT HE HAD MEANT TO USE HIMSELF
THAT A STATUE HAD BEEN ERECTED TO HIM IN THE FORUM IN HIS OLD AGE AFTER EARNEST STUDY HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN BUT REMAINED A LONG TIME A CATECHUMEN THROUGH FEARS OF WHAT HIS FRIENDS WOULD SAY AT LAST TAKING COURAGE HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR BAPTISM
SHOUTING ABUSING AND EVEN STRIKING EVERYBODY WHO CAME IN HIS WAY SHE WOULD LOOK AT HIM WITH GENTLE EYES THAT SHOWED NEITHER FEAR NOR ANGER SHE NEVER ANSWERED SHARPLY EVEN THOUGH HIS RUDE WORDS WOUNDED HER CRUELLY
OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
AT LAST HE SHUT THE BOOK AND AROSE MY MIND IS MADE UP HE SAID I SHALL ENTER GOD'S SERVICE HERE AND NOW IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO TOO AT LEAST DO NOT TRY TO HINDER ME YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL SAID THE OTHER I AM WITH YOU IN THIS THEY NEVER LEFT THE HERMITAGE
SHE ACCEPTED HUMBLY THE CORRECTION THAT AWAITED HER FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD DISOBEYED ALTHOUGH UNINTENTIONALLY HER NURSE'S ORDERS MONICA HAD BEEN WILFULLY DISOBEDIENT ONCE
THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
WITH TRIGETIUS BOTH PUPILS OF AUGUSTINE'S NEBRIDIUS WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN CARTHAGE AND WAS LIKE HIMSELF A NATIVE OF ROMAN AFRICA
HE BELIEVED THAT ATHENS EXISTED ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN THERE AS OF OLD A LITTLE GROUP OF FRIENDS HAD GATHERED ROUND HIM AT MILAN
SHE WAS OF NOBLE RACE AND BORN OF A CHRISTIAN MOTHER THOUGH HER FATHER WAS A PAGAN SHE WAS MARRIED AND HAD A LITTLE INFANT OF A FEW MONTHS OLD WHEN SHE WAS CALLED BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF HILARION THE ROMAN GOVERNOR
NOT FAR DISTANT LAY THE FIELD OF ZARNA WHERE THE GLORY OF HANNIBAL HAD PERISHED FOR EVER BUT ROME HAD LONG SINCE AVENGED THE SUFFERINGS OF HER BITTER STRUGGLE WITH CARTHAGE IT WAS THE AMBITION OF ROMAN AFRICA
AND IT WAS THE DELIGHT OF MONICA'S GIRLHOOD TO HEAR HER TELL THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO HAD BORNE WITNESS TO THE FAITH IN THEIR OWN LAND OF AFRICA PERPETUA WAS NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
HER HEART SANK AS SHE THOUGHT OF GRACES WASTED OF CONSCIENCE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT OF LIGHT REJECTED NO THERE WAS NO HOPE ANYWHERE BUT WITH GOD IN HIM SHE WOULD TRUST AND IN HIM ALONE
FRIENDS OF HIS OWN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE COUNTRY CAME TO A COTTAGE INHABITED BY SOME HOLY RECLUSES A LIFE OF SAINT ANTHONY LAY ON THE TABLE ONE OF THEM TOOK IT UP AND BEGAN TO READ HIS FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF ASTONISHMENT
HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
IF MEN ARE CONTENT TO LIVE AS THE BEASTS THAT PERISH THEY FALL AS FAR BELOW THEIR LEVEL AS GOD MEANT THEM TO RISE ABOVE IT AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS FALLING TO PIECES THROUGH ITS OWN CORRUPTION IN AFRICA THE WORSHIP OF THE OLD PUNIC GODS
THE WHOLE TOWN BEGAN TO TALK OF HIS NEGLECT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE MONICA SUFFERED CRUELLY BUT IN SILENCE WHEN HE WAS AT HOME WHICH WAS BUT SELDOM SHE WAS SERENE AND GENTLE AS USUAL
THE WOMAN TURNED ON HER YOUNG MISTRESS ANGRILY IT IS NOT FOR A WINE BIBBER LIKE YOU TO FIND FAULT WITH ME SHE RETORTED MONICA STOOD HORRIFIED THE WOMAN'S INSOLENT WORD HAD TORN THE VEIL FROM HER EYES
WHEN THIS FRIEND WAS TAKEN SUDDENLY ILL HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS IN A BURNING FEVER THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HOPE OF RECOVERY
DO GOD'S WILL AND ARE PURE OF HEART POSSESS GOD THEY ALL LAUGHED AT THE TRAP IN WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT THEM BUT MONICA SAYING THAT SHE WAS SLOW TO GRASP THESE THINGS ASKED TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT REPEATED
SOME STRONG AND VIGOROUS SOME FEEBLE AND SICKLY
SO THE HAPPY INNOCENT DAYS FLEW PAST IN THE PURSUIT OF THAT WISDOM WHICH IS ETERNAL
AND SEVERAL OTHERS LASTLY THERE WAS MONICA WHO WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND WHOSE SUNNY PRESENCE DID MUCH TO ENLIVEN THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS AUTUMN AN ITALIAN MID SEPTEMBER THE COUNTRY WAS A GLORY OF GREEN AND GOLD AND CRIMSON
THEY WOULD COME OUR WAY AND WE MIGHT FALL IN WITH THEM ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND HAVE A RUN I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER LYNTON MOUNTED ME ON A VERY NICE CHESTNUT AND THE REST OF THE PARTY HAVING GONE OUT SHOOTING AND THE YOUNG LADIES BEING OTHERWISE ENGAGED
AND THE ASPEN CLASHED ITS MYRIAD TINY CYMBALS TOGETHER PRODUCING AN ORCHESTRA OF SOUND THAT FILLED THE SOUL OF THE DREAMING BOY WITH LOVE AND DELIGHT
TO MY VEXATION I FOUND THAT I HAD LOST IT THE TOBACCO POUCH WAS THERE AND THE MATCHES MY PIPE MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT OF MY POCKET WHEN I WAS PITCHED FROM THE TRAP THAT PIPE WAS A FAVOURITE OF MINE WHAT A HOWLING NUISANCE SAID I
AUNT JOANNA WAS GIVEN AN ELM AND NOT A MEAN DEAL BOARD COFFIN SUCH AS IS PROVIDED FOR PAUPERS AND A HANDSOME ESCUTCHEON OF WHITE METAL WAS PUT ON THE LID MOREOVER PLENTY OF GIN WAS DRUNK AND CAKE AND CHEESE EATEN AT THE HOUSE
THE COLD FAINT GLIMMER OF COMING DAWN WAS VISIBLE OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN TOPS BUT STARS STILL SHONE IN THE SKY
IT FARED NO BETTER IN AUTUMN WHEN THE BLACKBERRY SEASON SET IN JOE WENT WITH HIS CAN TO AN OLD QUARRY WHERE THE BRAMBLES SENT THEIR RUNNERS OVER THE MASSES OF RUBBLE THROWN OUT FROM THE PITS
A VILLAGE OF SOME IMPORTANCE WITH SHOPS THE SEAT OF THE PETTY SESSIONS AND WITH A SMALL BOOT AND SHOE FACTORY IN IT THE STREET WAS DESERTED
COMING UP THE NAVE FIDDLING WITH HIS HAT ON REGARDLESS OF THE SACREDNESS OF THE PLACE
I AM AFRAID WE MUST ASK YOU TO CHANGE YOUR ROOM SHALL YOU MIND VERY MUCH I THINK WE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE COMFORTABLE UPSTAIRS IN THE GALLERY WHICH IS THE ONLY ROOM AVAILABLE LADY LYNTON HAS HAD A GOOD FIRE LIT
SOMEHOW IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TILL I HEARD YOUR STORY THAT POSSIBLY THE SKELETON IN THE CHALK PIT MIGHT BE THAT OF THE POACHING TINKER I WILL NOW MOST ASSUREDLY HAVE IT BURIED IN THE CHURCHYARD THAT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE DONE SAID I
LOOKING ON WITH SOLEMN WONDERING EYES ON THE LAST THROES OF HER WHOM THEY HAD LEARNED
FRANTIC WITH SHAME WITH SORROW NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE DID OR WHITHER SHE WENT ANNA MADE FOR THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE RAN FORTH AND STOOD IN THE VILLAGE SQUARE
IT WOULD REALLY BE A SHAME TO SPOIL A PAIR AND WHERE ELSE COULD SHE GET SUCH FINE AND BEAUTIFUL OLD LINEN AS WAS THIS SO SHE PUT THE SHEETS AWAY AND FURNISHED FOR THE PURPOSE A CLEAN BUT COARSE AND RAGGED SHEET SUCH AS AUNT JOANNA HAD IN COMMON USE
FOR AUNT JOANNA WAS VERY STRICT IN HER WESLEYANISM AND BITTERLY HOSTILE TO ALL SUCH CARNAL AMUSEMENTS AS DANCING AND PLAY ACTING OF THE LATTER THERE WAS NONE IN THAT WILD WEST CORNISH DISTRICT
ON REACHING THE HILLTOP WHERE LYNTON HAD EXPECTED TO MEET THE HOUNDS NO TRACE OF THEM WAS TO BE DISCOVERED THEY MUST HAVE FOUND AT ONCE AND RUN IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT THREE O'CLOCK AFTER WE HAD EATEN OUR SANDWICHES
BUT I DID NOT ON MY WORD I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM OR AT LEAST GAVE NO HEED TO THEM HOWEVER WHAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH AND HAVE DESCRIBED TO ME HAS MADE ME UNEASY
THEN HE ADDED NOW PULL ON YOUR DRESSING GOWN AND COME DOWNSTAIRS TO MY SANCTUM I FOLLOWED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN TO LADY LYNTON WHO WAS STANDING WITH THE DOOR OF HER ROOM AJAR IN A STATE OF GREAT AGITATION HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
AND HIS HEART DANCED AT THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT LIKE MISS AMORY THE CHOIR THE CONGREGATION WERE SINGING THE ADVENT HYMN TO LUTHER'S TUNE GREAT GOD
HE CONFIDED HIS DIFFICULTY TO POSTMAN ROGER GALE AND ROGER GALE SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER THE MATTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE POSTMAN SAID TO JOE GANDER THEY WANT A LAD TO SWEEP THE LEAVES IN THE DRIVE AT THE GREAT HOUSE
BUT A PLACE HAD BEEN KEPT FOR ME NEXT LADY LYNTON BESIDES MY HOSTS THERE WERE THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS COLONEL LYNTON A BROTHER OF SIR FRANCIS THE CHAPLAIN AND SOME OTHERS WHOM I DO NOT REMEMBER DISTINCTLY
OF HEART'S EASE OR PANSY SHE HAD IN HER HAND A SMALL BASKET PRESENTLY SHE ROSE AND WALKED TOWARDS THE GATE BY WHICH STOOD THE TRAVELLER AS SHE PASSED HE SAID KINDLY TO HER GRUESS GOTT
AND NEVER HAPPY WITHOUT A PENCIL IN HIS HAND YOU MARK WHAT I SAY SOME DAY HENCE WHEN HE IS DEAD THERE WILL BE A STATUE ERECTED IN HIS HONOUR HERE IN THIS MARKET PLACE TO COMMEMORATE THE ONE FAMOUS MAN THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY SIEBENSTEIN
THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN UTTERED A LOUD AND DISGUSTED UGH THEN WITH HIS HEAVY HAND SLAPPED THE HEAD OF THE CHILD TOWARDS THE PARSON'S CHURCHWARDEN WHO WITH HIS STILL HEAVIER HAND BOXED IT BACK AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE'S CHURCHWARDEN GAVE HIM A BLOW
BUT HE DISAPPOINTED EXPECTATIONS AND LIVED HIS MOTHER DIED SOON AFTER AND HIS FATHER MARRIED AGAIN AND HIS FATHER AND STEPMOTHER LOVED HIM DOUBTLESS BUT LOVE IS MANIFESTED IN MANY WAYS AND THE LAMBOLES SHOWED THEIRS IN A ROUGH WAY
INSTANTLY IT WAS AS THOUGH ANOTHER PAGE WERE REVEALED I SAW POLLY IN HER WIDOWED FATHER'S COTTAGE SHE WAS NOW A GROWN GIRL SHE WAS ON HER KNEES SCRUBBING THE FLOOR A BELL TINKLED THEN SHE PUT DOWN THE SOAP AND BRUSH TURNED DOWN HER SLEEVES
OR I AM ASKED OUT TO DINNER AND AM ENTREATED AFTERWARDS TO SING
THAT COST ONLY THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE EACH DAY AS HE PASSED THE SHOP HE WAS DRAWN TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING IN AND LONGED DAILY MORE ARDENTLY THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY FOR THIS THREE AND SIXPENNY VIOLIN
AND A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FOOTWAY THE SQUIRE WAS SHOCKED AS WERE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER AND THE CHURCHWARDENS WERE IN CONSTERNATION
THERE'S FINE AND BEAUTIFUL LINEN UNDERNEATH
AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IS KNOWN TO NO ONE ELSE AND MUST NOT BE MENTIONED BY YOU ANYHOW IN MY LIFETIME
THEN THE SMOKE MUST TAKE CARE OF ITSELF ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS WONT TO FIND ITS WAY OUT OF THE DOOR AND LITTLE OR NONE WENT UP THE CHIMNEY THE ONLY FUEL BURNT IN THIS COTTAGE WAS PEAT
I SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT FOR THE VAGUE TRADITION WHICH ALWAYS ATTACHES TO SUCH EVENTS AND FOR THIS FACT THAT AFTER MY GRANDFATHER'S DEATH A LETTER CAME ADDRESSED TO HIM FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM SOMEONE
AND THE WHOLE WOOD WHISPERED AND SANG TO HIM AND CONSOLED HIM FOR HIS BEATING AND THE WIND PLAYED LULLABIES AMONG THE FIR SPINES AND WHISTLED IN THE GRASS
ONCE IN BED I SLEPT SO SOUNDLY THAT MY SERVANT'S ENTRANCE THE NEXT MORNING FAILED TO AROUSE ME AND IT WAS PAST NINE WHEN I AWOKE AFTER BREAKFAST AND THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEWSPAPERS LYNTON RETIRED TO HIS LETTERS
PASSING BETWEEN THE TOMBSTONES DRAWN ON BY THE SOLEMN BEAUTIFUL MUSIC PRESENTLY HE STOOD IN THE PORCH THEN HE WENT ON HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE MUSIC
THEY SAY THAT HE VALUES IT ABOVE GOLD AND THIS IS THE NEW CHURCH HE HAS ERECTED IN HIS NATIVE VILLAGE THAT IS GOOD OH HE IS A GOOD MAN IS JOHANN HE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD AND SERIOUS BOY
WHERE SIR FRANCIS KEPT BOOKS AND PAPERS I KNEW HE HAD SOME WRITING TO DO AND I THOUGHT NO MORE ON THE MATTER I WAS DOWN THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST IN GOOD TIME HOW LATE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT I SAID TO LYNTON IN THE MIDDLE OF BREAKFAST I HEARD YOU OVERHEAD AFTER ONE O'CLOCK
THE RAY OF WHITE LIGHT ARRESTED BY HER FILLED HER AS A LAMP
AND THIS WAS SEEN GROPING ABOUT THE GRASS TILL IT LAID HOLD OF THE TEAPOT THEN IT GROPED AGAIN AND GATHERED UP THE SPOONS THAT FLASHED IN THE MOONBEAMS NEXT UP CAME THE SECOND HAND
THERE THE SUPERINCUMBENT SOIL IS RESOLVED INTO A QUAGMIRE NO TREE CAN GROW IN IT FOR THE MOMENT THE TAPROOT TOUCHES THE BLACK RAM THE TREE DIES OF WHAT BLACK RAM CONSISTS IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY THE POPULAR OPINION IS THAT IT IS A BASTARD MANGANESE
AND POINTED ONLY WITH LIME IT WAS THATCHED WITH HEATHER AND POSSESSED BUT A SINGLE CHIMNEY THAT ROSE BUT LITTLE ABOVE THE APEX OF THE ROOF
AND PUT UP AT THE KRONE WHERE AS HE WAS TIRED AND HUNGRY HE ORDERED AN EARLY SUPPER WHEN THAT WAS DISCUSSED HE STROLLED FORTH INTO THE VILLAGE SQUARE AND LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE CHURCHYARD
THE WHITE BUNDLE WAS CAST INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND CARRIED OVER THE CHURCHYARD WALL INTO THE WHEELWRIGHT'S YARD AT ONCE A CURTAIN OF VAPOUR RUSHED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON AND AGAIN THE GRAVEYARD WAS BURIED IN DARKNESS
AS FOR HIS VOICE IT WAS THIN AND TONELESS LIKE THE NOTES ON HIS IMPROVISED FIDDLE ON WHICH HE PLAYED INCESSANTLY THE CHILD WILL ALWAYS BE A DISCREDIT TO US SAID LAMBOLE
AND I ASKED LADY LYNTON IF ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS MIGHT SHOW ME THE HOUSE ELIZABETH THE ELDEST WAS SUMMONED AND SEEMED IN NO WAY TO DISLIKE THE TASK THE HOUSE WAS AS ALREADY INTIMATED BY NO MEANS LARGE
IT WAS GOOD TO BE ALIVE HE THOUGHT FREE SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED WITH LEAVE TO TELL A GIRL
IT WOULD BECOME IMBUED WITH MARVELOUS POSSIBILITY A THING FOR WHICH ROYAL MILITARY BUREAUS IMPERIAL NAVIES WOULD PAY A GREAT PRICE A TWIST OF THE LEVER WOULD DO IT YET HOW ALIKE AND EWELL WAS MAD
NOAKES LOOKED AT HIM IN A MOMENT OF AMAZEMENT ALMOST OF STUPEFACTION THE NECESSITY OF INSTANT ACTION STARTLED HIM TO MOVEMENT AS QUICKLY AS HE THOUGHT HE PUSHED THE DOOR THREE QUARTERS SHUT REPLACED THE JARS FROM WHICH HE HAD TAKEN HIS MATERIALS
HE HELD A STEADY HAND ON THE LEVER SO THAT HE MIGHT PUSH IT BACK INSTANTLY IF HE SAW IN THE CRUCIBLE TOO SUDDEN A TRANSFORMATION AS HE WATCHED THE DULL SAFFRON POWDER TOOK ON A DEEPER HUE ABOUT THE EDGE THE BODY OF IT REMAINING UNCHANGED
SAY YOU CARGAN CALLED CAN YOU GET AN AUTO ANYWHERE HERE
IT WAS WALDRON THEY SHOOK HANDS AS IF NOTHING WERE IN THE AIR AND THEN COMPARED WATCHES TO SEE IF THE TRAIN WERE ON TIME THIS DONE WALDRON TOOK OFF HIS GLASSES SWUNG THEM ON THEIR BLACK CORD AND BEGAN TO POLISH THEM NERVOUSLY
AND MOTIONED NOAKES TO A CHAIR NEAR THEM AH I SEE IT YOU WILL BE A SECOND MAX ALL SCIENCE ALL ABSENCE AND A WOMAN WAITING AT HOME IMMOLATION YOU CALL IT SHE CONTINUED
AS THE TRAIN PULLED INTO HIS HOME TOWN HE HURRIED OUT UPON THE STATION PLATFORM AND SAW WITH PRIDE AND PLEASURE THAT HIS WIFE WAS JUST STEPPING OUT OF THE RUNKLES MOTOR LOOKING ABOUT TO SEE WHO MIGHT BE THERE TO NOTE THE COMPANY SHE WAS KEEPING
WITH SLOW FINGERS MOVING THE KETTLES GENTLY CARGAN AND CASEY WERE BUSY HE FUMED FOR AN INSTANT THEN GAVE HIS OWN HOME NUMBER IT'S JIM HE SAID AND HEARD HIS WIFE'S CAROL OF SURPRISE HE COULD SEE HER TIPTOEING AT THEIR TELEPHONE
AND THE THOUGHT OF THEIR LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND THE KIDS PLAYING BEHIND HER WARMED HIS BLOOD I GOT RUN AWAY WITH ON THE PLAINS BUT I'M ALL RIGHT HER FRIGHTENED EJACULATION THRILLED HIM WITH LOVING PRIDE
BUT HAVING RISKED EVERYTHING I WILL GO TO HER ABLE AND WHOLE OFFERING IT ALL WITHOUT AN APOLOGY HIS GAZE WAS DRAWN BACK TO THE CRUCIBLE IN THE THIN HAZE ABOVE IT A FACE SEEMED TO SHINE
AS OTHERS SEE US SHE TURNED HER BACK WHILE SHE ARRANGED HER HAIR BEFORE THE MAKESHIFT MIRROR RELIEVED FROM HER DIRECT GAZE HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO THE STAND AND LOOKED INTO THE CRUCIBLE THERE WAS NO CHANGE HE HAD EXPECTED NONE BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE
THEN HE SLAMMED HIMSELF WITHIN AND SHOUTED CASEY'S ADDRESS TO THE OPERATOR AS HE WAITED HIS WRATH MOUNTED WHAT IN HECK WAS THE MATTER WITH ME ANYWAY HE SMOKED FURIOUSLY IN THE STIFLING BOX GO AHEAD SAID THE OPERATOR
AND HIS HEART LEAPED TO SEE BESIDE IT A TINY HOUSE OF UNPAINTED BOARDS WIRES STRETCHED FROM ONE WINDOW ALONG THE DEPRESSION WHICH LED WESTWARD UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE ENDLESS HORIZON AND AS HE PAUSED TO SURVEY A SHARP BELL RANG
SHE KNEW JUST HOW FAST TO TURN FOR OTHERS SO SLOWLY FOR HERSELF WHEN THE WATCH GAVE HER THE SIGNAL SHE WOULD BEGIN TO LISTEN IS THAT YOU
TWO BOYS WERE TEASING EACH OTHER ABOUT A GIRL A GROUP OF MEN WERE TALKING AUCTIONS OPTIONS PRICES REAL ESTATE HE DRANK THEIR TALK IN GREEDILY WITH A PANG OF HOMESICKNESS AND A RUSH OF RETURNING COMMON SENSE DISMOUNTING STIFFLY
HE HAD PERFECTED THE WORK OF A WEEK'S EXQUISITE DANGER HE HAD WON I AM GLAD GLAD HE SAID FAINTLY AS HE STRAIGHTENED UP HE FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY WEAK
HER FACE WAS TROUBLED AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE MOTOR SHE CAUGHT HER HUSBAND'S ELBOW GENTLY AS IF TO ASK HIM SOMETHING BUT HE MERELY NODDED AND TURNED HER GLANCE TOWARD CARGAN'S WINDOW SHE BOWED AND SMILED VERY SWEETLY IN HIS DIRECTION
HER HANDS MOVING QUICKLY AMONG THE APPURTENANCES OF THE TEA TABLE THAT IS WHAT YOU PREFER MY YOUNG MISTER NOAKES I AM UNDER ORDERS YOU KNOW MISSUS MAX SAID NOAKES WITH A DEFERENTIAL INCLINATION OF THE HEAD TOWARD MAXINEFF
NOT NECESSARILY OH YES SHE DOES FREEDOM FAMILY ASSOCIATIONS AND IN RETURN
THE WELL TRAINED HORSE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GRAZE HE TOO WAS QUIVERING WITH FATIGUE BUT HIS FRIGHT WAS OVER THE SUN WAS BURNING NEAR THE ZENITH THE WORLD AGAIN WAS EMPTY AND THIS TIME THERE WAS NO ROAD CARGAN WAS LOST
HE COULD DUPLICATE IT IN AN HOUR IF ONLY HE COULD REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT BEFORE TO NIGHT HE SAID AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A FIRM STEP HE DINED WELL THOUGH WITH FEW WORDS FOR THE KINDLY LADY IN WHOSE HOME HE LIVED
WE CAN HOLD HIM A LITTLE LONGER GOTTA SELL WALDRON OUT MUST HAVE MADE A THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT FIRST AND LAST TOO BAD A MOMENTARY SENSE OF WALDRON'S CALAMITY SWEPT OVER HIM BUT QUICKLY EVAPORATED BUSINESS IS BUSINESS
GOOD MORNING MISTER MAXINEFF SAID NOAKES TURNING SLOWLY THE RACKET SOME HALF BAKED FULMINATE I PUT IN THE DITCH OUT THERE AN HOUR AGO SO LONG SINCE SAID THE OLDER MAN ADVANCING TOWARD THE WINDOW
IT WAS TO MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT HE HAD RALLIED WONDERFULLY AT THE END AND WAS CONFIDENT OF RECOVERY
WAIT UNTIL I'VE FINISHED AND GRANT ME THAT IT'S WORTH WHILE HE WHISPERED TO THE FACE AND HIS BREATH MADE LITTLE SWIRLS AND EDDIES IN THE HAZE ABOUT IT THE FILMY CURVES WAFTED TOWARD HIM BRINGING IT CLOSE TO HIS LIPS THE LIDS FLUTTERED
THERE ISN'T AN ALKALI IN THE SHOP I WON'T ENDANGER YOU HE REPLIED EASILY SHE MOVED INTO THE ROOM AND PAUSED A MOMENT NEAR THE STAND MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE CONFINING YOURSELF TOO CLOSELY I'VE BEEN WITH HER ALL MORNING
A FEW MINUTES AGO SHE HAD HELD IT IN HER TREMBLING FINGERS AND PLACED IT IN THE MACHINE NOW
CARGAN SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS SADDLE AND TRIED TO THINK OF BUSINESS BUT INSTEAD OF BUSINESS QUEER CHILDISH IDEAS BEGAN FLOATING IN AND OUT OF HIS MIND ACCOMPANIED BY WORDS REMEMBERED FROM SUNDAYS IN HIS BOYHOOD HE WAS ALONE WITH GOD
TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I CANNOT HEAR THAT AGAIN I SHALL BE ON THE PORCH WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH THE WINDOW NOAKES SEATED HIMSELF TO LISTEN TO A NEW EXPOSITION OF THE SUBJECT WHICH CHIEFLY AROUSED MAXINEFF'S INTEREST AND LOOSED HIS SPEECH
SHE MERELY INSTALLED HIS MEMORY IN THE PLACE OF HIS RICH PERSONALITY AND LOVED THAT HE ALMOST MORE THAN EVER WAS HER STANDARD WHAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED SHE DID WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DISLIKED SHE LEFT UNDONE
SELL OUT WALDRON AT NOON TO MORROW UNLESS FIVE THOUSAND COLLATERAL SOMETHING'LL DROP FOR YOU OLD BOY HE GROWLED ADDRESSED THE TELEGRAM TO HIS PARTNER AND GAVE IT TO THE PORTER
IN THE NORTH A WHITE CLOUD MASS PILED ITSELF UP AND UP UNTIL IT SEEMED AS IF IT MIGHT TOPPLE OVER UPON THE FLAT WORLD BENEATH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE LOOKED AT THE COUNTRY EXCEPT AS REAL ESTATE NEVER SEEN THE PLAINS
BLAZING WITH MARBLE AND ONYX IN THE AFTERNOON SUN MADE CARGAN'S DRY THROAT WRINKLE WITH THIRST HE PULLED HIS HORSE TOWARD THAT SIDE OF THE STREET THERE WAS A ROW OF CUSTOMERS ALONG THE SODA WATER COUNTER AND THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS CAME SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED AFRESH BY THE FORCEFUL EXTERIOR SIGNIFICANT OF THE INNER ATTITUDE WHICH HAD WON FOR HENRY MAXINEFF A NAME HONORED AMONG NATIONS WHAT OF YOUR WORK HE SAID NOAKES WAS GLAD THOSE SEEING EYES WERE NOT ON HIM
I FORGOT TO HAVE LUNCHEON TO DAY AND YOUR TEA HAS GIVEN ME A KEEN ANTICIPATION FOR DINNER MY ZEST WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO YOU AND PAST MY CONTROL BESIDES I SHALL TAKE A HALF MILE WALK TO NIGHT LUCKY BECKY THEN COME AGAIN SOON MAX DEAR SHE SAID
THE DARNED OLD SELF CONFIDENT ARISTOCRAT HE MURMURED WORKING HIMSELF UP INTO A FURY THINKS HE CAN BLUFF ME BUT HE'LL FIND OUT WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BELIEVE ME THEN HE DISPELLED HIS IRRITATION BY A COCKTAIL AND HURRIED INTO THE DINER
MONTANA PACIFIC'S OFF TWO POINTS MORE
AND STILL MORE THE HUSH OF THAT ENORMOUS PLAIN THE SOLEMNITY OF THE GREAT AND SHINING SKY FILLED HIM WITH HIGH AND NOBLE THOUGHTS SAY IS HAMDEN NEAR HERE HE ASKED OF A SLIM WOMAN IN A GINGHAM DRESS WHO APPEARED AT THE DOOR
AND CAGLIOSTRO WHEN THE PUZZLE'S SOLVED COME TO SEE ME I'LL SING AWAY THE WORRIES GOOD BYE GOOD BYE MISS BECKY EXCUSE MY UNTRACTABLENESS WON'T YOU WITH A PAT TO HER HAT AND A SMILE TO NOAKES SHE WAS GONE
TO ORTHODOXY SHE THREW OFF THE CREED OF HER PARENTS AS NATURALLY AND SIMPLY AS IF IT WERE A BORROWED GARMENT
THE STRAIN HAD BEEN GALLING AND THE MADNESS OF GRATIFICATION CONSUMED HIS STRENGTH HE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR STEPPING VERY GENTLY FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW SLIGHT A VIBRATION MIGHT SHATTER THE DELICATE AFFINITY IN HIS DISCOVERY
YOU ARE PRACTICAL MY FRIEND CONFESS NOW THERE IS A REASON FOR YOUR YOUR APPLICATION NOAKES'S ATTITUDE WAS UNCOMPROMISING HE PLACED HIS CUP ON THE TABLE BEFORE HE SPOKE THE REASON YOU ARE THINKING OF MISSUS MAX IS NOT FOR A POOR MAN
TO KNOW IF SUCH AN APPLICATION HAS EVER BEEN MADE TO THE GOVERNOR OF AN ENGLISH JAIL BEFORE WHAT DO YOU SAY HARDINGE THE MAJOR SHUFFLED IN HIS CHAIR I I THINK I MUST RETURN TO TOWN THE PRISONER SMILED THE MAJOR WINCED
WASHING A CARRIAGE WITH A BUCKET OF WATER
MARGARET MURMURED MISSUS CHALMERS LET'S GO HOME WHY AUNT IT WILL PASS OFF IN TIME IN TIME AT THAT MOMENT I HEARTILY WISHED THAT HUGHES HAD BEEN AT JERICHO BEFORE HE INDUCED ME TO DABBLE IN HIS PATENT MEDICINES
I DO LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER HE OBSERVED WHEN AS USUAL HE SENT MY FIRST BALL OUT OF SIGHT NEVER MIND ABOUT THE BALL I'VE GOT ONE IN MY POCKET YOU CAN HAVE HE HAD HE PRODUCED IT ALWAYS FROM THE SAME POCKET IT WAS ABOUT THE SECOND THOUSAND
BUT IT'S THE SHEEP THAT'S DONE IT THEY'VE ABOUT SHEARED ME
BUT THE ADMISSION DID NOT CRUSH THEM QUITE THE OTHER WAY IT OPENED THE FLOODGATES OF THEIR ELOQUENCE THAT'S NOTHING MISTER SAPSWORTH CRIED THERE'S HEDGES HERE WE'VE HAD TO PUT HIM IN
ORIGINALLY THERE HAD BEEN QUITE A CROWD ASSEMBLED IN COURSE OF TIME THIS HAD DWINDLED TO HALF A DOZEN STRAGGLERS A LITTLE LATER ON EVEN THESE HAD GONE
BUT MISTER BENYON INTERVENED NOW BOB SAPSWORTH YOU TAKE THE BOWLING ONE END AND LET YOUR CAPTAIN TAKE THE OTHER CAPTAIN YOU TAKE FIRST OVER I OBEYED WITHOUT A MURMUR
SAID THE GOVERNOR THUS URGED THE MAJOR DID READ IT GOOD LORD HE GASPED AND PASSED IT TO THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SILENTLY HAVING READ IT PASSED IT TO THE CHAPLAIN I WILL READ IT ALOUD
AND GENERAL CONVERSATION SEEMED OUT OF THE QUESTION SO I TRIED ANOTHER LINE
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT I'VE MADE MYSELF ONE KIND OF ASS AND YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF ANOTHER KIND
BUT HIS PARTNER TOOK CARE TO MAKE HIM RUN AN INCREDIBLY LARGE ODD NUMBER AS A WIND UP TO EVERY OVER MISTER BENYON DID NOT SEEM TO BE DISTRESSED BY THE EXERTION IN THE LEAST MISTER BARKER EMPHATICALLY DID
SUFFICIENT I TRUST TO BRING THE MATTER BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
AND ONE DAY A DEPUTATION OF THE INHABITANTS CALLED ON ME AT MY LODGINGS TO ASK IF I WOULD LEAD THE LOCAL CRICKET CLUB TO SAY VICTORY AS I HAVE SAID
BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD BOTH OF US SEE THAT SHE MADE A GOOD THING OF IT WHEN THE SALE GOT UP I NEED SCARCELY OBSERVE WHAT FORTUNES HAVE BEEN MADE IN PATENT MEDICINES AND LOST IN THEM MY BOY
FOR MY CHARACTER'S SAKE I AM BUT BEGINNING YOU PERCEIVE OH YOU'RE BUT BEGINNING YOU CALL THIS BUT BEGINNING DO YOU MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTION OF GOING ON
SQUARE IT OFF I SUSPECT SHE MEANT
AND WHICH I COULDN'T HELP AND THAT'S HOW IT IS I'M A LITTLE BEHIND I SEE I SAID AND IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH PINT POTS I HAVE NO DOUBT SO HE SAT DOWN ON A SEAT WHICH WAS WET OWING TO THERE BEING A DRIZZLE ON
THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN WAS THE LOCAL BARBER HIS NAME WAS SAPSWORTH HE EXPLAINED THAT MISTER WINGRAVE HAD SENT THEM THERE WINGRAVE WAS THE VICAR WE WERE UP
FAR LESS HITTING AT A CRICKET BALL WITH ONE AND YET IN THIS STATE OF UNPREPAREDNESS I HAD THE PRESUMPTION LAST SUMMER TO CAPTAIN A TEAM AND TO LEAD THEM ON WELL NOT TO VICTORY BUT TO DISGRACE
THEY WERE THE KEENEST MEN OF BUSINESS TOO AND TALK OF THE RIGOUR OF A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION THEY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO AN EXAMINING BOARD WHICH VERY SOON TOOK THE STIFFENING OUT OF ME
I WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE CONDITION IN WHICH ALICE MUST HAVE BEEN IN WONDERLAND PREPARED FOR ANYTHING TIME WENT ON MISTER SAPSWORTH AND I BOWLED OVER AFTER OVER MISTER BENYON WAS MAKING A RECORD IN TALL SCORING
SHE SNIFFED AT IT IT HAS A VERY DISAGREEABLE SMELL THAT WAS GOOD I PROTEST THAT I HAVE SMELT DADDY'S DELIGHT WHEN I WAS PASSING THE HOUSE AND TOOK IT TILL I KNEW BETTER FOR DRAINS
DRAWN FROM HIM AS IF IT WERE HIS EYE TOOTH IT DID MAKE ME FEEL REALLY WILD I NEVER SAID A WORD TO HIM
REMINDED ME OF MY DUTIES AS A CAPTAIN NOW THEN TURN OUT SEND YOUR MEN INTO THE FIELD WE CAN'T STOP HERE ALL DAY I'M FIRST MAN IN
THEY'RE SUCH A THIRSTY LOT POSSIBLY I SUGGESTED THAT IS IN A MEASURE OWING TO THE NATURE OF THEIR OCCUPATION THAT MAY BE BUT STILL THERE IS A LIMIT AND WHEN A MAN IS ALWAYS DRINKING I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO STOP
AND A FINE SCUFFLE I HAD TO GET THERE TOO AND IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME HE KEPT ME WAITING TWO HOURS AND THREE QUARTERS BY THE CLOCK WHAT'S OVER THE GATEKEEPER'S LODGE WHICH IS LONGER THAN ANY GENTLEMAN OUGHT TO KEEP A LADY WAITING
APPARENTLY NOT REJOICING IN HIS FREEDOM HE WROTE WILLIAM HARDINGE IN GREAT SPRAWLING CHARACTERS ADD INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE IN A SENSE OF BEING A GIANT AMONG PIGMIES YET THE MAJOR AT LEAST WAS IN EVERY WAY A BIGGER MAN THAN HE WAS THERE WAS SILENCE AS HE ENTERED
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SUSPECT ME OF HANKY PANKY YES SIR I WILL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE IF YOU WISH IT YOU SHALL BE TORN ASUNDER WHERE YOU STAND
AND ASK FOR MISSUS HENRY EVANS WHAT IS MY BROTHER'S WIFE SO TO SPEAK IT MIGHT SMOOTH THE WAY SO I SAID I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU JUST NOW YOU WAS SAYING AS HOW YOUR BROTHER WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE US ARE YOU NOW INSINUATING OTHERWISE
THERE IS A SUSPICION FLOATING THROUGH MY MIND THAT AT ONE OR TWO POINTS TWO OR MORE MEN WERE PLACED UNUSUALLY CLOSE TOGETHER FOR INSTANCE AT DEEP MID OFF VERY DEEP MID OFF
THE SOONEST MENDED AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I WILL GO AND GET MYSELF SOMETHING TO EAT BEING HUNGRY AND HAVING I AM THANKFUL TO SAY MONEY OF MY OWN WITH WHICH TO PAY FOR IT
TESTIMONIALS THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT I KNOW THERE IS NOT MUCH PERHAPS BUT STILL SOMETHING THAT BOTTLE SIR CONTAINS A REMEDY FOR ALL KNOWN DISEASES AND ALL UNKNOWN ONES FOR ALL THAT I CAN TELL IN FACT
IN A BEAUTIFULLY FAIR ROUND HAND AS CLEAR AS COPPERPLATE THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONIAL THE UNDERSIGNED PERSONS PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO COLONEL GREGORY
SHOULD HEAD THE LIST I I I'D RATHER SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNED FIRST THAT WOULD NEVER DO IT IS FOR YOU TO LEAD THE VAN YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE YOUR SEAT THE MAJOR LEFT HIS SEAT
THE GOVERNOR LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT YOUR SUGGESTION HAS AT LEAST THE FORCE OF NOVELTY I SHOULD LIKE TO SEARCH THE REGISTERS OF REMARKABLE CASES
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS GOOD AND EVIL I KNOW THAT FOR CAUSES WHICH ARE HIDDEN FROM ME THE ALMIGHTY MAY PERMIT EVIL TO TAKE VISIBLE SHAPE AND WALK ABROAD UPON THE EARTH
I DECIDED TO CRUSH THE DEPUTATION BEFORE THE THING WENT FARTHER TO SHOW YOU THE SORT OF MAN YOU PROPOSE SHOULD CAPTAIN YOU
HAVE SUCH A THING AS A CRICKET BALL IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
CAPTAIN I HAVE SOME IDEA OF CRICKET NOT MUCH PERHAPS BUT I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME I WAS NOT IN THE VARSITY TEAM NOR NEAR IT BUT I PLAYED IN THE FRESHMAN'S MATCH
HIS ATTIRE SUGGESTED SEEDINESS PERCEIVING THAT I DID NOT APPRECIATE HIS MANNER HE EXPLAINED NO OFFENCE INTENDED SIR BUT I JUST NOW SAW YOU PLAYING PANTALOON TO THAT YOUNGSTER'S CLOWN
MISTER BENYON URGED THE FIELDERS ON HURRY UP BILL HEDGES MISTER HEDGES DID NOT HURRY UP HE NEVER COULD HAVE HURRIED UP EVEN IF HIS MANNER OF FIELDING THE BALL HAD NOT WHOLLY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WIND BUT THE BALL WAS AT LAST THROWN IN
SO I SAID WELL WILLYUM HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN IT'S MY DAY OUT I THOUGHT YOU WAS GOING TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE HE SAID SO I AM SO I SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME TO
MISTER HAWTHORN AND MISTER HEDGES WERE NOT ONLY DOING THEIR BEST TO TRAMPLE ON EACH OTHER'S TOES BUT EACH WAS SEEKING FOR A PLACE OF SECURITY BEHIND THE OTHER'S BACK MISTER BARKER SHARED WITH MISTER BENYON THE HONOUR OF BEING FIRST MAN IN
THERE IS ONE SUGGESTION I MIGHT OFFER LET'S HAVE IT BY ALL MEANS WE HAVE REACHED A POINT AT WHICH WE SHALL BE GLAD TO RECEIVE ANY SUGGESTION FROM YOU YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL
RAISED IN HONOUR OF THE HOLY MARTYRS AND AS IF DISPLAYING THEIR CONQUERING STANDARDS IN ALL PLACES CELEBRATED FESTIVALS AND PERFORMED THEIR SACRED RITES WITH PURE HEARTS AND LIPS THIS PEACE CONTINUED IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES OF BRITAIN
WE ARE COMMANDED TO KEEP EASTER IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR WHICH IS ALSO CALLED THE MONTH OF NEW THINGS BECAUSE WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE THE MYSTERIES OF OUR LORD'S RESURRECTION AND OUR DELIVERANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF OUR MINDS RENEWED TO THE LOVE OF HEAVENLY THINGS
AND THEREFORE MOST EXCELLENT SON WE EXHORT YOU WITH SUCH FATHERLY LOVE AS IS MEET TO LABOUR TO PRESERVE THIS GIFT IN EVERY WAY BY EARNEST STRIVING AND CONSTANT PRAYER IN THAT THE DIVINE MERCY HAS VOUCHSAFED TO CALL YOU TO HIS GRACE
BUT BE READY FOR I WILL RETURN AND VISIT YOU AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS AND WHEN YOU COME INTO YOUR COUNTRY YOU SHALL RECOVER THE GREATER PART OF THE POSSESSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU AND SHALL END YOUR DAYS IN PEACE AND QUIET THE BISHOP ACCORDINGLY RECOVERED
BEING LED TO EXECUTION HE CAME TO A RIVER WHICH WITH A MOST RAPID COURSE RAN BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE TOWN AND THE ARENA
KEEP BEFORE YOUR EYES THAT LOVE OF HIS DOCTRINE WHICH HE ZEALOUSLY BESTOWED FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SOULS THAT HIS PRAYERS MAY EXALT YOUR KINGDOM AND PEOPLE
TO OUR MOST BELOVED AND MOST HOLY TOMIANUS COLUMBANUS CROMANUS DINNAUS AND BAITHANUS BISHOPS
UNTIL THE TIME OF THE ARIAN MADNESS WHICH HAVING CORRUPTED THE WHOLE WORLD INFECTED THIS ISLAND ALSO SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH THE POISON OF ITS ERROR AND WHEN ONCE A WAY WAS OPENED ACROSS THE SEA FOR THAT PLAGUE
SO THAT AT MIDNIGHT THE BEHOLDERS ARE OFTEN IN DOUBT WHETHER THE EVENING TWILIGHT STILL CONTINUES OR THAT OF THE MORNING HAS COME SINCE THE SUN AT NIGHT RETURNS TO THE EAST IN THE NORTHERN REGIONS WITHOUT PASSING FAR BENEATH THE EARTH
BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO CONCEAL A REBELLIOUS AND SACRILEGIOUS MAN RATHER THAN TO DELIVER HIM UP TO THE SOLDIERS
MIGHT FROM THAT TIME FORWARD BE MOST EASILY KNOWN BY ALL MEN
WITHOUT THE SCOURGE OF DIVINE SEVERITY IN CHASTISEMENT AND CORRECTION FOR HE WAS TROUBLED WITH FREQUENT FITS OF MADNESS AND POSSESSED BY AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT
I AM SENT TO CALL YOU BACK FROM DEATH FOR THE LORD HAS GRANTED YOU LIFE THROUGH THE PRAYERS AND TEARS OF YOUR DISCIPLES AND BRETHREN AND THE INTERCESSION OF HIS BLESSED MOTHER MARY OF PERPETUAL VIRGINITY WHEREFORE I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHALL NOW RECOVER FROM THIS SICKNESS
FOR THIS REASON THE DAYS ARE OF A GREAT LENGTH IN SUMMER AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE NIGHTS IN WINTER ARE EIGHTEEN HOURS LONG FOR THE SUN THEN WITHDRAWS INTO SOUTHERN PARTS IN LIKE MANNER THE NIGHTS ARE VERY SHORT IN SUMMER
BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THEIR REQUEST IRELAND IS THE LARGEST ISLAND NEXT TO BRITAIN AND LIES TO THE WEST OF IT BUT AS IT IS SHORTER THAN BRITAIN TO THE NORTH SO ON THE OTHER HAND IT RUNS OUT FAR BEYOND IT TO THE SOUTH
THAT HE MIGHT THERE ALSO BY HIS AUTHORITY AS PROVOST AND BY THE EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN PRACTICE INSTRUCT THE BRETHREN IN THE OBSERVANCE OF REGULAR DISCIPLINE FOR THE SAME REVEREND FATHER THEN GOVERNED THAT PLACE ALSO AS ABBOT
SO KEEN HIS DESIRE TO PERSUADE MEN OF WHAT HE TAUGHT SUCH A LIGHT SHONE IN HIS ANGELIC FACE THAT NO MAN PRESENT DARED TO CONCEAL FROM HIM THE SECRETS OF HIS HEART BUT ALL OPENLY REVEALED IN CONFESSION WHAT THEY HAD DONE
AND PUT THEM TO FLIGHT THENCE HE PROCEEDED TO THE RIVER THAMES WHERE A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THE ENEMY HAD POSTED THEMSELVES ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
CONCERNING WHICH LIKEWISE YOU DESIRED ME TO WRITE TO YOU BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE USE OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AND WE KNOW INDEED THAT THE APOSTLES WERE NOT ALL SHORN AFTER THE SAME MANNER
FOR YOU CANNOT BE IGNORANT HOW THAT EXECRABLE HERESY HAS BEEN CONDEMNED FOR IT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN ABOLISHED THESE TWO HUNDRED YEARS BUT IT IS ALSO DAILY CONDEMNED BY US AND BURIED UNDER OUR PERPETUAL BAN
BUT THE ENEMY STRUCK HOME WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HE WOUNDED THE KING THROUGH THE BODY OF THE SLAUGHTERED THEGN BEING THEN ATTACKED ON ALL SIDES WITH SWORDS IN THE CONFUSION HE ALSO SLEW IMPIOUSLY WITH HIS DAGGER ANOTHER OF THE THEGNS WHOSE NAME WAS FORTHHERE
THE FIFTH WAS EDWIN KING OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN NATION THAT IS OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE DISTRICT TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER HUMBER HIS POWER WAS GREATER
AND THE SAME TIME WITH HIM SO HE MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED WORTHY TO BE RECEIVED INTO THE LIKE ABODE OF ETERNAL BLISS THE MOST REVEREND FATHER DIED IN THE ISLE OF FARNE
AND THERE GIVING HIMSELF TO THE SERVICE OF THE MONKS HE STROVE DILIGENTLY TO LEARN AND TO PRACTISE THOSE THINGS
WHO AT THAT TIME SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR OUR LORD
WHEN HE LEARNED THAT THE NATION OF THE NORTHUMBRIANS WITH THEIR KING HAD BEEN BY THE PREACHING OF PAULINUS CONVERTED TO THE FAITH AND CONFESSION OF CHRIST
BUT BECAUSE PETER WAS SO SHORN IN MEMORY OF THE PASSION OF OUR LORD THEREFORE WE ALSO WHO DESIRE TO BE SAVED BY THE SAME PASSION DO WITH HIM BEAR THE SIGN OF THE SAME PASSION ON THE TOP OF OUR HEAD
HEREBERT A MAN OF HOLY LIFE WHO HAD LONG BEEN UNITED WITH THE MAN OF GOD
BOTH BY THE AUTHORITY OF A MASTER AND THE EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR NOR DID HE BESTOW HIS TEACHING AND HIS EXAMPLE IN THE MONASTIC LIFE ON HIS MONASTERY ALONE
SO THAT LIKE THE SAMARITANS OF OLD HE SEEMED AT THE SAME TIME TO SERVE CHRIST AND THE GODS WHOM HE SERVED BEFORE
AND OF DIVERS AGES AND CONDITIONS WHO WERE DOUBTLESS ASSEMBLED BY DIVINE INSPIRATION
BUT HE WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AND UNADVISEDLY EMBRACE THE MYSTERIES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH THOUGH HE NO LONGER WORSHIPPED IDOLS EVER SINCE HE MADE THE PROMISE THAT HE WOULD SERVE CHRIST
TO ITS NEAREST SHORE THERE IS AN EASY PASSAGE FROM THE CITY OF RUTUBI PORTUS
WHICH PLACE HE HAD FORMERLY GIVEN TO THOSE THAT FOLLOWED THE DOCTRINE OF THE SCOTS TO BUILD A MONASTERY THERE
TO HIS MOST NOBLE SON AND EXCELLENT LORD EDWIN KING OF THE ANGLES BISHOP HONORIUS SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD GREETING
AND AS A PLEDGE THAT HE WOULD PERFORM HIS PROMISE HE DELIVERED UP THAT SAME DAUGHTER TO BISHOP PAULINUS TO BE CONSECRATED TO CHRIST
REFUSED TO STRIKE THE HOLY CONFESSOR OF WHOM IT IS APPARENT THAT THOUGH HE WAS NOT PURIFIED BY THE WATERS OF BAPTISM YET HE WAS CLEANSED BY THE WASHING OF HIS OWN BLOOD AND RENDERED WORTHY TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
IN ADDITION TO THE BRITONS AND THE PICTS THERE IS A VERY LARGE GULF OF THE SEA WHICH FORMERLY DIVIDED THE NATION OF THE BRITONS FROM THE PICTS
YOU MUST THEREFORE ENDEAVOUR MY BROTHER TO PRESERVE WITH UNBLEMISHED SINCERITY OF MIND THAT WHICH YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE BEARING IN MIND WHAT IT IS THAT IS REPRESENTED BY THE HONOURABLE VESTMENT WHICH YOU HAVE OBTAINED TO BE BORNE ON YOUR SHOULDERS
HAST THOU HE SAID FORGOTTEN MY EXAMPLE WHO FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE LITTLE ONES WHOM CHRIST COMMENDED TO ME IN TOKEN OF HIS AFFECTION UNDERWENT AT THE HANDS OF INFIDELS AND ENEMIES OF CHRIST
AND BURNS WHEN PUT TO THE FIRE AND WHEN SET ON FIRE DRIVES AWAY SERPENTS BEING WARMED WITH RUBBING IT ATTRACTS WHATEVER IS APPLIED TO IT LIKE AMBER THE ISLAND WAS FORMERLY DISTINGUISHED
AND TO HAVE NO PART WITH THEM IN ANYTHING ANY MORE THAN WITH PAGANS
THE WHOLEHEARTEDNESS OF YOUR CHRISTIAN MAJESTY IN THE WORSHIP OF YOUR CREATOR IS SO INFLAMED WITH THE FIRE OF FAITH THAT IT SHINES OUT FAR AND WIDE AND BEING REPORTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BRINGS FORTH PLENTIFUL FRUITS OF YOUR LABOURS
BUT LABOURED FAR AND WIDE TO CONVERT THE PEOPLE DWELLING ROUND ABOUT FROM THE LIFE OF FOOLISH CUSTOM TO THE LOVE OF HEAVENLY JOYS FOR MANY PROFANED THE FAITH WHICH THEY HELD BY THEIR WICKED ACTIONS AND SOME ALSO
BUT THERE IS AT THE PRESENT DAY SO GREAT A NUMBER OF CALCULATORS THAT EVEN IN OUR CHURCHES THROUGHOUT BRITAIN THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVING LEARNED THE ANCIENT RULES OF THE EGYPTIANS
GIVING THANKS TO GOD THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND WORTHY TO RECEIVE SUCH A GIFT FROM THE LAND OF THE ENGLISH
IN THE TIME OF A PESTILENCE NEGLECTING THE MYSTERIES OF THE FAITH WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED HAD RECOURSE TO THE FALSE REMEDIES OF IDOLATRY AS IF THEY COULD HAVE PUT A STOP TO THE PLAGUE SENT FROM GOD BY INCANTATIONS AMULETS
THE GRACE OF THE ETERNAL KING PRESERVE YOU IN SAFETY LONG REIGNING FOR THE PEACE OF US ALL MY DEARLY BELOVED SON IN CHRIST
OF WHICH LICENCE THIS IS THE FORM BONIFACE TO HIS MOST BELOVED BROTHER JUSTUS
NOR DOES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NOW AS IT AGREES IN ONE FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY TOWARDS GOD
IF YOU SEEK TO ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF OUR RELIGION
OR OVER KING BECAUSE HE CLAIMED AUTHORITY OVER ALL THE OTHERS THERE WAS ALSO A KING OVER EACH OF THE FIVE PROVINCES LEINSTER MUNSTER CONNAUGHT ULSTER AND MEATH
WHO ISSUED ORDERS EACH DAY FOR THE PROVISIONS TO BE LAID IN FOR NEXT DAY THE NUMBER OF OXEN SHEEP AND HOGS TO BE SLAUGHTERED THE QUANTITY OF BREAD TO BE BAKED AND OF ALE MEAD AND WINE TO BE MEASURED OUT
AND HE REGULATED THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS
IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND THE HEPTARCHY THE ANGLO SAXONS WERE THE RULING RACE RUDE AND STUBBORN AND GREATLY ATTACHED TO THEIR GLOOMY NORTHERN PAGAN GODS
THE EXACT TIME OF HIGH TIDE FOR ANY DAY OF THE MONTH AT A PARTICULAR PLACE IN ANY YEAR NO MATTER HOW FAR BACK NOW THE QUESTION IS WAS THE TIDE REALLY AT ITS HEIGHT ON THE CLONTARF SHORE AT SUNRISE
WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME SO ILLUSTRIOUS HE WAS ITS FIRST ABBOT AND FOR THIRTY YEARS IT WAS GOVERNED BY HIM AND BY TWO OTHER IRISH ABBOTS FINAN AND COLMAN IN SUCCESSION
WAS INTENDED TO PRODUCE SLEEP AND THE TUNES BELONGING TO THIS STYLE WERE PLAINTIVE AND SOOTHING SUCH AIRS ARE NOW KNOWN AS LULLABIES OR NURSE TUNES OR CRADLE SONGS OF WHICH NUMEROUS EXAMPLES ARE PRESERVED IN COLLECTIONS OF IRISH MUSIC
AS SUITED HIS FANCY OR CONVENIENCE
FROM THE DRUID'S INCANTATION FROM HIS BLACK AND DEADLY SNARE FROM THE WITHERING IMPRECATION OF THE DEMON OF THE AIR IT WILL GUARD THEE GENTLE CONNLA OF THE FLOWING GOLDEN HAIR
ON ONE OCCASION SENT A MANY COLOURED TUNIC TO HIS FOSTER SON PRINCE CONGAL LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT OF MANY COLOURS A VERY COMMON ARTICLE OF DRESS WAS A LARGE CLOAK GENERALLY WITHOUT SLEEVES
VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
FROM WHOM THE ANGLO SAXONS LEARNED THEM SO THAT ENGLAND RECEIVED HER FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET AS SHE RECEIVED MOST OF HER CHRISTIANITY FROM IRELAND FORMERLY IT WAS THE FASHION TO CALL THOSE LETTERS ANGLO SAXON
A LAND FROM SORROW FREE IT LIES FAR OFF IN THE GOLDEN WEST ON THE VERGE OF THE AZURE SEA A SWIFT CANOE OF CRYSTAL BRIGHT THAT NEVER MET MORTAL VIEW
AND THE BOOK OF BALLYMOTE THESE CONTAIN MUCH THE SAME KIND OF MATTER AS THE BOOK OF LEINSTER WITH PIECES MOSTLY DIFFERENT HOWEVER BUT THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO OLD THE SPECKLED BOOK WHICH IS ALSO IN DUBLIN
THEY HELD THEIR GROUND SUCCESSFULLY AS THE LAY SCHOOLS DID DURING THE EVIL DAYS OF LATER AGES WHEN DETERMINED ATTEMPTS WERE MADE UNDER THE PENAL LAWS TO SUPPRESS THEM AND AT THE PRESENT DAY
AFTER A LABORIOUS CALCULATION DOCTOR HAUGHTON FOUND THAT THE TIDE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT THAT MORNING AT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK JUST AS THE SUN WAS COMING OVER THE HORIZON AND THAT THE EVENING TIDE WAS IN AT FIFTY FIVE MINUTES PAST FIVE
CONTAINS A COMPLETE SURVEY OF THE SOCIAL LIFE AND INSTITUTIONS OF ANCIENT IRELAND ALL THE IMPORTANT STATEMENTS IN IT ARE PROVED HOME BY REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES
THE LETTERS OF WHICH WERE FORMED BY COMBINATIONS OF SHORT LINES AND POINTS ON AND AT BOTH SIDES OF A MIDDLE OR STEM LINE
THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW IS PRESERVED IN THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY IN DUBLIN IT IS FIFTY YEARS OLDER THAN THE BOOK OF LEINSTER BUT NOT SO LARGE
AND FOSSE HALF OBLITERATED THE WHOLE STRUCTURE COVERING ABOUT ELEVEN ENGLISH ACRES LIE TWO MILES WEST OF ARMAGH ANOTHER ULSTER PALACE QUITE AS IMPORTANT AS EMAIN
WHICH BECAME SO CELEBRATED ALL OVER EUROPE BEFORE GOING FARTHER IT IS WELL TO REMARK THAT THESE SCHOOLS ALSO CONTINUED AND INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED AS TIME WENT ON
SOME HARMLESS SOME MALIGNANT WHO WILL BE FOUND ENUMERATED AND DESCRIBED IN EITHER OF MY TWO SOCIAL HISTORIES THE IDOLS WORSHIPPED BY THE PAGAN IRISH WERE NEARLY ALL OF THEM STONES MOSTLY PILLAR STONES
RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY ALL REMARKABLE EVENTS SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY YEAR BY YEAR THE EXTREME CARE THEY TOOK THAT THEIR STATEMENTS SHOULD BE TRUTHFUL IS SHOWN BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY COMPILED THEIR BOOKS
AND THESE POOR SCHOLARS AS THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO BE CALLED RECEIVED TEACHING BOOKS AND OFTEN FOOD ALL FREE BUT MOST OF EVEN THE POOREST DID THEIR BEST TO PAY SOMETHING
THERE WAS A MASTER OF HORSE WITH NUMEROUS GROOMS KEEPERS OF THE KING'S JEWELS AND CHESSBOARDS COURIERS OR RUNNERS TO CONVEY THE KING'S MESSAGES AND ORDERS AND TO BRING HIM TIDINGS
OF THE OLD IRISH COLLEGES THERE WERE NO COMFORTABLE STUDY ROOMS WELL FURNISHED WITH DESKS SEATS AND ROSTRUMS NO SPACIOUS LECTURE HALLS THE GREATER PART OF THE WORK INDEED WAS CARRIED ON IN THE OPEN AIR
AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
ALL THESE BOOKS ARE WRITTEN WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND IN MOST BEAUTIFUL PENMANSHIP THE FIVE OLD BOOKS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN LATELY PRINTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PRINT RESEMBLES EXACTLY THE WRITING OF THE OLD BOOKS THEMSELVES
OR NOTED DOWN SOME EVENT THAT HAD OCCURRED YEARS BEFORE TAKING HEARSAY EVIDENCE OR CALCULATING THE TIME BACKWARDS AS BEST HE COULD THE CHANCES WERE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ERROR IN THE DATE
FROM IRISH MASTERS THERE AS FOR THE NUMEROUS CONTINENTAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN WHICH IRISHMEN FIGURED EITHER AS PRINCIPALS OR PROFESSORS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH OUR LIMITED SPACE
THE PEOPLE OF SEVERAL DISTRICTS HAD LOCAL GODS ALSO SUCH AS DONN
TILL THE GROUND WAS COVERED HALF A YARD DEEP AND BRING ON STORMS AND TEMPESTS ON SEA OR LAND THEY COULD DRIVE A MAN MAD BY THEIR SORCERY A POWER WHICH WAS DREADED MOST OF ALL BY THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
THE BEST POSSIBLE AUTHORITY IN THE CASE AS HE HAD GOOD REASON TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS A FULL CONFIRMATION OF THIS HIS RECORD IS SIMPLE AND PLAIN THEN FLIGHT BROKE OUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DANISH HOST
MANY WERE TO BE FOUND IN EGYPT AND AS EARLY AS THE SEVENTH CENTURY THREE LEARNED IRISH MONKS FOUND THEIR WAY TO CARTHAGE WHERE THEY LABOURED FOR A LONG TIME AND WITH GREAT SUCCESS WHEREVER THEY WENT
THE WRITER MAKES THESE VERY SPECIFIC STATEMENTS THAT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON GOOD FRIDAY THE TWENTY THIRD APRIL
THE OLD IRISH KINGS LIVED IN GREAT STYLE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE HIGHER RANKS AND LIKE THE KINGS OF OUR OWN DAY KEPT IN THEIR PALACES NUMBERS OF PERSONS TO ATTEND ON THEM HOLDING VARIOUS OFFICES
BEQUEATHED BY OLD GREECE AND ROME HAD BEEN ALMOST WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE BY THE BARBAROUS NORTHERN HORDES WHO OVERRAN EUROPE AND CHRISTIANITY HAD NOT YET TIME
WERE THE BEST TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ACCORDINGLY STUDENTS CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE KNOWN WORLD TO PLACE THEMSELVES UNDER THE MASTERS OF THESE SCHOOLS FROM GERMANY FRANCE ITALY EGYPT
THE LARGER ONES ARE OF MOST ADMIRABLE WORKMANSHIP FORMED BY HAMMERING CURVED JOINTED ORNAMENTED AND RIVETED WITH EXTRAORDINARY SKILL AND PERFECTION OF FINISH
EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE RECORDS WE FIND EVIDENCES THAT THE ANCIENT IRISH BOTH HIGH AND LOW WERE PASSIONATELY FOND OF MUSIC IT WAS MIXED UP WITH THEIR DAILY HOME LIFE AND FORMED PART OF THEIR AMUSEMENTS MEETINGS AND CELEBRATIONS OF EVERY KIND
THERE WERE MANY OTHER GODS AND THERE WERE GODDESSES ALSO POETS PHYSICIANS AND SMITHS HAD THREE GODDESSES WHOM THEY SEVERALLY WORSHIPPED THREE SISTERS ALL NAMED BRIGIT
AND LAY THE TABLES AND WHEN THE MEAL IS OVER THEY REMOVE EVERYTHING WASH UP DISHES AND PLATES AND PUT THEM ALL BY IN THEIR PROPER PLACES IN FACT THEY PERFORM MOST OF THE WORK EXPECTED FROM ORDINARY SERVANTS
THERE'S YOUR MOTHER THEY WILL ALL AGREE TO WHAT WILL MAKE US HAPPY AND WILL YOU AGREE TO WHAT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY YES MY DARLING WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL
IT SUGGESTS THAT GRACIOUS PROVIDENCE BY LONG AND LOVELY PROCESSES FORESTALLING MAN'S NEEDS
THE MINX KNEW THAT SHE HAD DONE ENOUGH THAT DAY TO TURN EARLE MORAY'S HEAD AND IT WOULD BE WELL TO LET THE EFFECT DEEPEN IN ABSENCE SHE DANCED OFF HOMEWARD AND EARLE WHISPERED UNDER HIS BREATH AGAINST HER ANKLES AS SHE TROD THE LUCKY BUTTERCUPS DID NOD
THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE DREAMING IS EVEN BETTER THAN IDLING SAID DORIS AND HERE IS A REAL LAND OF DREAMS SEE HOW THE POPPIES BEND SLEEPY WITH SUNSHINE THE SUNSHINE IS A FLOOD OF REFINED GOLD
THOU ART MY LIFE MY SOUL MY HEART THE VERY EYES OF ME THOU HAST COMMAND OF EVERY PART TO LIVE AND DIE FOR THEE HIS RICH YOUNG VOICE ROLLED FORTH THESE WORDS WITH DEEP FEELING DORIS LAUGHED AT THE SONG AT FIRST
HE WAS FERVID HANDSOME ROMANTIC BRILLIANT IN LOVE'S FIRST GOLDEN GLOW HARD TO RESIST SHE SMILED AT HIM LET US FANCY WE WILL NOT BE PARTED SHE SAID SWEETLY
LORD VIVIANNE DREW ASIDE THE FALLEN BRANCH OF A SLENDER WILLOW THAT SHE MIGHT FIND ROOM TO SIT DOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR LOVERS HE REPEATED SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SMILE BUT WE ARE NOT LOVERS SHE SAID
FOR IF LOOKING WELL WON'T MOVE HER LOOKING ILL MUST FAIL
AND BE GREAT YES I DO I WOULD LIKE THAT
SHE REPLIED THEN HE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT COSTLY JEWELS SHE WORE AND HOW HER HANDS WERE COVERED WITH SHINING GEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME A THRILL OF UNEASINESS OF DOUBT OF FEAR SHOT THROUGH HIM
THEY DREW NEAR THE ELM WITH WHAT CONSUMMATE ART WERE THE VIOLET EYES DRAWN DOWN FROM CONTEMPLATION OF THEIR NATIVE SKIES TO COMPREHENSION OF EARTH'S LOWER THINGS
YOU ARE THE FIRST LADY WHOM I HAVE HEARD PLEAD GUILTY TO BAD TEMPER AS A RULE WOMEN PREFER MAKING THEMSELVES OUT TO BE ANGELIC I AM VERY FAR FROM THAT SAID DORIS FRANKLY NOR AM I NATURALLY BAD TEMPERED IT IS BECAUSE NOTHING IN MY LIFE PLEASES OR INTERESTS ME
NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO SAY SUCH A WORD NO ONE SHOULD EVER THROW AWAY ALL GOOD THAT HEAVEN HAS GIVEN HIM BECAUSE OF ONE GOOD WITHHELD DOES SHE LOVE ME
AND RUTH YOUNG AND FAIR AND TENDER I CANNOT QUITE FANCY HOW NAOMI LOOKED LIKE OTHER OLD WOMEN WITH A SAD HISTORY I SUPPOSE BUT THE WORDS ARE LOVELY WHITHER THOU GOEST I WILL GO THY PEOPLE SHALL BE MY PEOPLE
TO THE RIVER SIDE AND NOT FIND HER HE WILL THINK THAT I HAVE RUN AWAY WITH SOME ONE ELSE SHE THOUGHT AND THE IDEA AMUSED HER SO INTENSELY THAT SHE LAUGHED ALOUD YOU ARE WELL CONTENT SAID EARLE BITTERLY
MATTIE CAME BACK DORIS MOTHER THINKS YOU HAD BETTER UNPACK YOUR TRUNK YOUR DRESSES WILL BE RUMPLED LYING IN IT SO LONG YOU UNPACK IT LIKE A DEAR I SHALL RUIN MY THINGS TAKING THEM OUT
TEN MINUTES LATER THEY WERE WALKING RAPIDLY TOWARD THE LITTLE TOWN OF SEIPIA THERE THEY COULD GO BY TRAIN TO GENOA AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE HIGH ROAD DORIS LAUGHED AND TALKED GAYLY
HE WAS RECKLESS EXTRAVAGANT OVER MONEY BUT AS FOR GENEROSITY HONOR OR PRINCIPLE SHE KNEW HE HAD NONE IN TRUSTING TO THAT SHE WOULD INDEED TRUST TO A BROKEN REED BESIDES
YOU SPEAK SO GRAVELY YOU LOOK SO COLDLY THAT YOU MAKE ME QUITE UNHAPPY HIS FACE FLUSHED SLIGHTLY AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED I DO NOT WISH TO SEEM UNKIND DORIS BUT LET ME ASK YOU
YOU MUST ASK THE PEOPLE AT THE FARM SHE SPOKE WITH RELUCTANCE IT ALWAYS IRRITATED HER TO CALL THE HONEST BRACE FAMILY PARENTS SISTER I CAN'T BE MARRIED TILL THEY SAY SO AND
SHE HATED THE FARM THE COUNTRY SHE WANTED THE GLORY OF THE CITY DRESS THEATERS OPERAS PROMENADES CAN'T YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET WHAT I WANT CHILD SAID GREGORY
THAN A WHEAT FIELD WITH GOLDEN SHEAVES I AM A TRUE CHILD OF THE CITIES SAID DORIS DESPITE MY COUNTRY BIRTH AND RURAL NAME I WAS JUST THINKING HOW SUPERIOR ARE THE ATTRACTIONS OF PAVED STREETS FILLED WITH MEN AND WOMEN
I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY DORIS IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO INTERFERE DO AS YOU PLEASE THAT IS LIKE MY OLD LOVER EARLE NOW I BEGIN TO FEEL AT HOME WITH YOU I DID USE YOU VERY WICKEDLY
WHO COULD HELP BEING AMBITIOUS WITH YOU AS THE APOSTLE OF AMBITION YOU ENFORCE WITH YOUR BEAUTY EACH WORD THAT YOU UTTER YOU THINK ME BEAUTIFUL
THE FIRE AND PASSION OF HIS WORDS SCARED HER YOUR FACE HAUNTS ME I SEE IT WHEREVER I GAZE HE CONTINUED YOUR VOICE HAUNTS ME I HEAR IT IN EVERY SOUND I WOULD FAIN WIN YOU IF I CAN FOR MY OWN
SHE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A YOUNG COUNTRYMAN A RHYMSTER WHO BELIEVED HIMSELF A POET ONE WITH WHOM SHE COULD FLIRT TO PASS AWAY THE TIME AND TO KEEP IN PRACTICE NOT THIS GENTLEMAN IN AIR AND DRESS WITH THE CULTIVATED MUSICAL VOICE THE NOBLE FACE
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR SISTER IS MAKING BUTTER AND YOUR MOTHER COOKING DINNER WHILE YOU ARE PLAYING SHEPHERDESS UNDER A TREE DO I LOOK AS IF I COULD WORK LAUGHED DORIS SPRINGING TO HER FEET AND EXTENDING A WEE ROSE LEAF HAND I AM ONLY FOR ORNAMENT NOT USE
TO KNOW ITS REAL VALUE THIS IS MY BEST DRESS TOO SHE SAID AND DO YOU KNOW EARLE THAT AS I PUT IT ON I SAID TO MYSELF I DO NOT LOOK AMISS IN THIS I WISH EARLE COULD SEE ME DID YOU REALLY
IT WAS OFTEN SO WHEN SHE HAD SUNNED EARLE WITH HER SMILES SHE WITHDREW HER PRESENCE OR CHANGED SMILES TO FROWNS SO HE WAS NEVER CLOYED WITH TOO MUCH SWEETNESS WHEN DORIS WITHDREW IN VAIN HE SANG UNDER THE WINDOW OR SENT HER LOVE FULL NOTES
THE SWEETEST OF SOULS AND HER WAY MUST ALWAYS BE A GOOD WAY THE GIRL WAS INFINITELY MORE LOVELY THAN ONE COULD LOOK FOR IN THE CHILD OF MARK AND PATTY BRACE THE SISTER OF GENTLE MATTIE BUT BEING THE CHILD OF MARK AND PATTY
LADY ESTELLE HE REPEATED
THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE HER SURROUNDED BY ALL THE LUXURIES OF HER POSITION THE HONORED DAUGHTER OF NOBLE PARENTS IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE IN HER
ESPECIALLY FOR ONE OF MODERATE MEANS WHAT FOOLS MEN ARE IN LOVE MATTERS QUOTH PATTY TO HERSELF AT LEAST MOST MEN WITH A THOUGHT BACKWARD TO MARK'S SENSIBLE CHOOSING THIS DREAMER AND VERSE WRITER WOULD HAVE DONE WELL TO CHOOSE OUR MATTIE
BUT I WILL LEAVE MISTER MORAY FOR EVIL COMMUNICATIONS CORRUPT GOOD MANNERS AND I HAVE MADE HIM LAZY GOOD BYE POET BLESSINGS BRIGHTEN AS THEY TAKE THEIR FLIGHT SO I EXPECT TO LOOK MORE AND MORE CHARMING AS I DEPART HOMEWARD
AND LEANING BACK AGAINST HER OAK TREE SHE LAUGHED JOYOUSLY I HAVE FOUND A FELLOW SINNER AMBITION CAN BE NOBLE RATHER THAN EVIL AND TO ASPIRE IS NOT TO SIN
THEY WOULD NOT LET ME COME AWAY BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT PERSISTED EARLE IT IS RIGHT ENOUGH IF I GO BACK TO THEM I SHALL NOT GO WITH YOU I CAN WRITE TO THEM AS SOON AS I REACH ENGLAND AND TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT
IT WOULD BE JUST THIS DULLNESS REPEATED ALL MY LIFE SAID DORIS TEARFUL AND POUTING IT WOULD BE LOVE COMFORT SAFETY GOODNESS
HOWEVER MISS DORIS IS BETTER THAN MISS BRACE SHE REACHED FOR A POPPY GROWING IN THE GRASS AND THE BOOK FELL FROM HER KNEE EARLE PICKED IT UP AND SAW WHAT IT WAS THIS HE EXCLAIMED IN GENUINE CONSTERNATION
EARLE CAME HURRYING UP ONE DAY AFTER DINNER NOW FOR A LONG EVENING IN THE GARDEN HE CRIED I HAVE BROUGHT A NEW DRAMA THE POETRY IS EXQUISITE WE WILL SIT IN THE ARBOR UNDER THE HONEYSUCKLE
