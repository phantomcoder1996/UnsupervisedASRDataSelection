WE'LL HAVE A BIG VASEFUL OF WILD ROSES IN THE CENTER AND ONE SINGLE ROSE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY'S PLATE AND A SPECIAL BOUQUET OF ROSEBUDS ONLY BY MISSUS MORGAN'S AN ALLUSION TO THE ROSEBUD GARDEN YOU KNOW
MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
TWENTY DOLLARS SAID ANNE WHO WAS NEVER MEANT TO MATCH BUSINESS WITS WITH A COPP OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED HER PRICE AT THE START WELL I'LL SEE SAID MISS SARAH CAUTIOUSLY
AND SAW FLASHES OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE TWILIGHT FROM DIANA'S WINDOW IN GROUPS OF FIVE WHICH MEANT ACCORDING TO THEIR OLD CHILDISH CODE COME OVER AT ONCE FOR I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO REVEAL ANNE THREW HER WHITE SHAWL OVER HER HEAD
WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
SAID DIANA WHO HOWEVER WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE MISGIVINGS ON THE SUBJECT ANNE SAID MARILLA COMING OUT FROM THE PARLOR
I PUT A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN WE ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU LIKE IT
FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE GOSSIP THAT MISTER HARRISON IS GOING TO SEE ISABELLA ANDREWS NO I'M SURE THERE ISN'T HE JUST CALLED THERE ONE EVENING ON BUSINESS WITH MISTER HARMON ANDREWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAW HIM AND SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS COURTING BECAUSE HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON
MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
BUT COULDN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO REMAIN SO FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE COMING AFTER ALL SAID MARILLA CROSSLY ANNE AND DIANA SOUGHT COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AT HALF PAST ONE MARILLA AGAIN EMERGED FROM THE PARLOR
DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
OR TILL TOMORROW SUGGESTED DIANA IF THEY'RE NOT BACK BY SUNSET YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE RELUCTANTLY BUT YOU MUSTN'T GO UNTIL YOU REALLY HAVE TO
OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
DAVY WAS EMPHATIC ON THAT POINT NOR I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO UNCLE RICHARD NEITHER I'D FAR RATHER LIVE HERE EVEN IF MARILLA IS THAT LONG TAILED WORD WHEN IT COMES TO JAM CAUSE YOU'RE HERE ANNE
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
AND THE DUST ON THE ROAD WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER SIX WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER OH I DO WISH IT WOULD RAIN SOON SIGHED ANNE EVERYTHING IS SO PARCHED UP THE POOR FIELDS JUST SEEM PITIFUL TO ME
MARILLA DIANA AND ANNE FLED OUT THE LATTER PAUSING ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SET THE PRECIOUS PLATTER HASTILY DOWN ON THE SECOND STEP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PANTRY A TRULY HARROWING SPECTACLE MET THEIR EYES
AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
WE MUST PREPARE FOR IT SAID ANNE TRANQUILLY A THUNDERSTORM SEEMED A TRIFLE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THE HORSE AND BUGGY INTO THAT OPEN SHED FORTUNATELY MY PARASOL IS IN THE BUGGY HERE TAKE MY HAT WITH YOU
YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
THE TABLE WAS SET IN THE SITTING ROOM WITH MARILLA'S FINEST LINEN AND THE BEST CHINA GLASS AND SILVER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT EVERY ARTICLE PLACED ON IT WAS POLISHED OR SCOURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION OF GLOSS AND GLITTER
IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
FOR SHE HAD PAID TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE PLATTER HAD SERVED ITS PURPOSE AT THE AID BAZAAR AND HAD THEN BEEN RETURNED TO THE GREEN GABLES CLOSET FOR ANNE WOULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY BUT HERSELF TO TAKE IT BACK TO TOWN
SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
SAID MISS SARAH AMIABLY YOU NEEDN'T WORRY THERE'S NO HARM DONE THANK GOODNESS WE COPPS KEEP OUR PANTRIES PRESENTABLE AT ALL TIMES AND DON'T CARE WHO SEES INTO THEM AS FOR THAT OLD DUCKHOUSE I'M GLAD IT'S SMASHED
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND ONE LIKE IT SOMEWHERE AND BUY IT FOR HER I'M AFRAID NOT PLATTERS AS OLD AS THAT ARE VERY SCARCE MISSUS LYNDE COULDN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE FOR THE SUPPER I ONLY WISH I COULD FOR OF COURSE MISS BARRY WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE ONE PLATTER AS ANOTHER
BUT IT'S WORTH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S A VERY OLD PLATTER DIANA GAVE ANNE'S FOOT A GENTLE KICK UNDER THE TABLE MEANING DON'T AGREE SHE'LL LET IT GO FOR TWENTY IF YOU HOLD OUT BUT ANNE WAS NOT MINDED TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IN REGARD TO THAT PRECIOUS PLATTER
A CONSTRUCTION OF LATHES WITH A PEAKED ROOF WHICH HAD IN TIMES PAST SERVED AS A HABITATION FOR DUCKS THE COPP GIRLS HAD GIVEN UP KEEPING DUCKS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH UNTIDY BIRDS
I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
AND THE TREES SEEM TO BE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS PLEADING FOR RAIN AS FOR MY GARDEN IT HURTS ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO IT I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GARDEN WHEN THE FARMERS CROPS ARE SUFFERING SO
THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN
ADDING THOSE WHO ARE BEGGARS BY PROFESSION TO THE BULK OF FARMERS COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGGARS IN EFFECT I DESIRE THOSE POLITICIANS WHO DISLIKE MY OVERTURE
IN SUCH A MANNER AS INSTEAD OF BEING A CHARGE UPON THEIR PARENTS OR THE PARISH
WOULD FALL FLAT IN MOTION PICTURES THE MINOR SITUATIONS OF DRAMATIC INTENSITY MIGHT IN MANY CASES BE BUILT UP THE CRISIS WOULD INEVITABLY FAIL IAGO AND OTHELLO AND LEAR
TO BE ABOUT TWO SHILLINGS PER ANNUM RAGS INCLUDED
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A BEVY OF VILLAGE LOVERS IS CONVEYED IN A LIVELY SWEET HEARTING DANCE THEN THE BOY AND HIS COMRADES GO FORTH TO WAR THE LINES PASS BETWEEN HAND WAVING CROWDS OF FRIENDS
TELLING GOOD BY TO THEIR KINDRED ON THE PIERS THEN THE DRAMA OF ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK THE WONDER OF THE STEERAGE PEOPLE POURING DOWN THEIR PROPER GANGWAY IS CONTRASTED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL
WELL BE DIPPED INTO BY THE READER BEFORE HE GOES TO SUCH A PLAY AS THE ITALIAN OR THE BATTLE IS THE WORK WHICH BEARS THE TITLE OF THIS CHAPTER CROWDS
OF TWENTY MINUTES EACH THESE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY PLEASE AT ALL ONE CAN SEE THEM AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT
AND THAT IN HIS TIME THE BODY OF A PLUMP GIRL OF FIFTEEN WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR AN ATTEMPT TO POISON THE EMPEROR WAS SOLD TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S PRIME MINISTER OF STATE AND OTHER GREAT MANDARINS OF THE COURT
IMPERSONATES THE ITALIAN IN A FILM OF THAT TITLE BY THOMAS H INCE AND G GARDENER SULLIVAN THE FIRST PART TAKEN OSTENSIBLY IN VENICE DELINEATES THE FESTIVAL SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGES
MOB MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY WILL GO THROUGH FANATICAL AND PROVINCIAL WHIRLWINDS INTO GREAT NATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY A BOOK BY GERALD STANLEY LEE THAT HAS A SCORE OF FUTURE SCENARIOS IN IT A BOOK THAT MIGHT
IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES AS A STANDARD ONE REEL FILMS ARE UNFORTUNATE IN THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER TO SEE A FAVORITE THE STUDENT MUST WAIT
BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT IT IS A WONDER IN ITS GRIFFITH SECTIONS IN ITS HANDLING OF MASSES OF MEN IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE NOTABLE THE OLD ONE REEL BATTLE FILM DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POPISH INFANTS IS AT LEAST THREE TO ONE IN THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE ONE OTHER COLLATERAL ADVANTAGE BY LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS AMONG US
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT
IT REPRESENTS IN AN ACUTER WAY ANOTHER PHASE OF THE SAME CHILD STRUGGLE WITH THE HEAT THAT THE GAMINS INDICATE IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE WATER CART THEN A DEEPER MATTER
THAT THEY WILL FIRST ASK THE PARENTS OF THESE MORTALS WHETHER THEY WOULD NOT AT THIS DAY THINK IT A GREAT HAPPINESS TO HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR FOOD AT A YEAR OLD IN THE MANNER I PRESCRIBE
SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE
AND WHEN THE FAMILY DINES ALONE THE FORE OR HIND QUARTER WILL MAKE A REASONABLE DISH AND SEASONED WITH A LITTLE PEPPER OR SALT WILL BE VERY GOOD BOILED ON THE FOURTH DAY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER
WHERE ARE WE GOING THE CROWD SCARE THE STRIKE AN INVENTION FOR MAKING CROWDS THINK THE CROWD'S IMAGINATION ABOUT PEOPLE SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE CROWD
THIS CROWD IS INTERPRETED IN ESPECIAL FOR US
A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND
HYDROPHOBIA IN THE LATTER END OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN UNCONSCIOUSLY MISTER DIXON HAS DONE HIS BEST TO PROVE THAT LEGREE WAS NOT A FICTITIOUS CHARACTER
THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN
I HAVE RECKONED UPON A MEDIUM THAT A CHILD JUST BORN WILL WEIGH TWELVE POUNDS AND IN A SOLAR YEAR IF TOLERABLY NURSED ENCREASETH TO TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS
AND FOR THE TIME BREAKS HER HEART HE GOES FORTH A FUGITIVE NOT ONLY FROM BATTLE BUT FROM HER TERRIBLE GIRLISH ANGER BUT LATER HE RALLIES HE
LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF THESE AND THE LIKE EXPEDIENTS TILL HE HATH AT LEAST SOME GLYMPSE OF HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVER BE SOME HEARTY AND SINCERE ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE BUT
I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
BRINGS A TRAIN OF POWDER WAGONS THROUGH FIRES BUILT IN HIS PATH BY THE ENEMY'S SCOUTS HE LOSES EVERY ONE OF HIS MEN AND ALL BUT THE LAST WAGON WHICH HE DRIVES HIMSELF HIS RETURN WITH THAT AMMUNITION SAVES THE HARD FOUGHT DAY
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN
THEY BESIEGE THE FOUNTAIN END OF THE STREET SPRINKLING WAGON QUITE CLOSELY REJOICING TO HAVE THEIR CLOTHES SOAKED THEY GATHER ROUND THE FIRE PLUG THAT IS TURNED ON FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND AGAIN BECOME WET AS DROWNED RATS PASSING THROUGH THESE CROWDS
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
WHICH THE MOTHER MAY CERTAINLY GET OR THE VALUE IN SCRAPS BY HER LAWFUL OCCUPATION OF BEGGING AND IT IS EXACTLY AT ONE YEAR OLD THAT I PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM
FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE
IMPERSONATED BY HENRY B WALTHALL ENTERS NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS REPRESENTING THE WHOLE ANGLO SAXON NIAGARA HE HAS THE MASK OF THE KU KLUX KLAN ON HIS FACE
LISTEN TO THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE DIVISIONS OF HIS BOOK CROWDS AND MACHINES LETTING THE CROWDS BE GOOD LETTING THE CROWDS BE BEAUTIFUL CROWDS AND HEROES
ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY
TILL THE CRISIS HAS PASSED THE WRATH OF THE SOUTHERNER AGAINST THE BLACKS AND THEIR NORTHERN ORGANIZERS HAS BEEN PILED UP THROUGH MANY PREVIOUS SCENES
THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
I RECOMMEND THEIR WORKS TO HIM AS A BETTER BASIS FOR FUTURE SOUTHERN SCENARIOS THE BIRTH OF A NATION HAS BEEN VERY PROPERLY DENOUNCED FOR ITS SIMON LEGREE QUALITIES BY FRANCIS HACKETT JANE ADDAMS AND OTHERS
AND WHEN HE WILL GO TO THE PICTURE SHOW TO VERIFY IT THE SHODDIEST SILENT DRAMA MAY CONTAIN NOBLE VIEWS OF THE SEA THIS PART IS ALMOST SURE TO BE GOOD IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCE
AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BREEDERS I AGAIN SUBTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO MISCARRY OR WHOSE CHILDREN DIE BY ACCIDENT OR DISEASE WITHIN THE YEAR
AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE
THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR
I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD
BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN
AND IN GONDOLAS IT GIVES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN CROWD HAPPINESS
CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
I THINK THE ADVANTAGES BY THE PROPOSAL WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE OBVIOUS AND MANY AS WELL AS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR FIRST AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED
AND CLARA WILLIAMS AS THE ITALIAN AND HIS SWEETHEART THEY OWE THE FORCE OF THEIR ACTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY EXPRESS EACH MASS OF HUMANITY IN TURN THEIR CHILD IS BORN IT DOES NOT FLOURISH
THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES
WHO CAN WRITE NOVELS AND EPICS BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM WRITE PLAYS WELL THE FILM LENDS ITSELF ADMIRABLY TO THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS PROPER TO NARRATIVE AND EPIC BUT PHYSICALLY
I SHALL REITERATE THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE NECESSITY FOR RESTRAINT A ONE HOUR PROGRAMME IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE IF THE OBSERVER IS PLEASED HE WILL SIT IT THROUGH AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER HOUR
AND THE REST OF THE KINGDOM WHERE PROBABLY THEY WILL BE SOLD SOMEWHAT CHEAPER THE REMAINING EIGHTY THOUSAND
IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION WHICH COULD BETTER BE CALLED THE OVERTHROW OF NEGRO RULE THE KU KLUX KLAN DASHES DOWN THE ROAD AS POWERFULLY AS NIAGARA POURS OVER THE CLIFF FINALLY THE WHITE GIRL ELSIE STONEMAN
THESE FRIENDS GIVE THE SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN MASS THEN AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING AS THE SPECIAL AGENTS TO EXPRESS IT THE SOLDIERS ARE IN BATTLE BY THE FORTUNES OF WAR
LASTLY OF PUTTING A SPIRIT OF HONESTY INDUSTRY AND SKILL INTO OUR SHOP KEEPERS WHO
BUT IF YOU DON'T TEACH ELSIE WENT ON GAZING AT ME WITH THOSE WONDERING BIG BLUE EYES OF HERS WHATEVER WILL YOU DO BROWNIE HER HORIZON WAS BOUNDED BY THE SCHOLASTIC CIRCLE
OF COURSE I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF TAKING A LADY'S MAID'S PLACE FOR A PERMANENCY NOR EVEN IF IT COMES TO THAT AS A PASSING EXPEDIENT BUT IF I WANTED TO GO ROUND THE WORLD
YES MADEMOISELLE
THEY DON'T MAKE EM ANY LONGER IN ENGLAND I'M SURE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE TRADE IN RUSTIC INNOCENCE HAS BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE COUNTRY I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AS I SHOULD LIKE TO DO OF COURSE
NO MOSQUITOES NO PASSPORTS NO GOODNESS GRACIOUS CHILD DON'T LET THAT ODIOUS MAN BANG ABOUT MY HAT BOX HAVE YOU NO IMMORTAL SOUL PORTER THAT YOU CRUSH OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY AS IF IT WAS BLACKBEETLES NO I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE THIS LOIS
IF YOU DON'T WISH TO BE OVERHEARD YOU OUGHTN'T TO SHOUT BESIDES I DESIRED TO DO YOU A SERVICE THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY REGARDED ME ONCE MORE FROM HEAD TO FOOT I DID NOT QUAIL THEN
THE COUNT ANSWERED AND OGLED HER THENCEFORWARD TO DOVER THEY TALKED TOGETHER WITH CEASELESS ANIMATION THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WAS CAPITAL COMPANY SHE HAD A TANG IN HER TONGUE AND IN THE COURSE OF NINETY MINUTES
SO I ACCEPTED MY PLIGHT AS AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE AFFORDING FULL SCOPE FOR THE CONGENIAL EXERCISE OF COURAGE AND INGENUITY HOW BOUNDLESS ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF KENSINGTON GARDENS THE ROUND POND
AND HE HANDED IT ACROSS TO HER SHE READ IT AND PASSED IT ON
THIS IS MY JEWEL BOX IT CONTAINS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE FAWLEY FAMILY JEWELS I POSITIVELY DECLINE TO APPEAR AT SCHLANGENBAD WITHOUT A DIAMOND TO MY BACK THIS NEVER LEAVES MY HANDS
I CUT OUT HALF HER CLOTHES FOR HER HER OWN IDEAS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY LIMITED TO DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS AND CUTTING OUT A BLOUSE BY DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IS WEARY UPHILL WORK FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER
THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY

OMNIBUSES TRAVERSE IT FROM END TO END EVEN I AM TOLD TO ISLINGTON AND PUTNEY WITHIN FOLK SIT FACE TO FACE WHO NEVER SAW ONE ANOTHER BEFORE IN THEIR LIVES AND WHO MAY NEVER SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN OR ON THE CONTRARY

WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN I DEVISE A PLAN THEREFORE I SUBMIT MYSELF TO FATE OR IF YOU PREFER IT I LEAVE MY FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE I SHALL STROLL OUT THIS MORNING
CERTAINLY NOT MY CHILD I ANSWERED SHE WAS THREE YEARS OLDER THAN I SO I HAD THE RIGHT TO PATRONISE HER THAT WOULD SPOIL ALL YOUR DEAR LITTLE FACE WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SCARE AWAY A TIMID ADVENTURE
I KISSED HER FLUFFY FOREHEAD YOU GOOD GENEROUS LITTLE ELSIE I CRIED I WON'T STOP HERE ONE MOMENT AFTER I HAVE FINISHED THE PAINTING AND PAPERING I CAME HERE TO HELP YOU
DO I LOOK LIKE A WOMAN WHO CARES ABOUT A REFERENCE WHAT ARE CALLED CHARACTERS ARE USUALLY ESSAYS IN HOW NOT TO SAY IT YOU TAKE MY FANCY THAT'S THE POINT AND POOR TOM CAYLEY
AND MAKE THE MAN AT THE OFFICE GIVE YOU A NOTE OF IT TO CHECK THOSE HORRID BELGIAN PORTERS THEY'LL CHARGE YOU FOR DOUBLE THE WEIGHT UNLESS YOU REDUCE IT AT ONCE TO KILOGRAMMES I KNOW THEIR WAYS FOREIGNERS HAVE NO CONSCIENCES

LOIS CAYLEY YOU SAY ANY RELATION OF A MADCAP CAPTAIN CAYLEY WHOM I USED ONCE TO KNOW IN THE FORTY SECOND HIGHLANDERS HIS DAUGHTER I ANSWERED FLUSHING
IT IS KIND OF YOU TO GIVE ME THIS WARNING BUT I THINK I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I COME YOU SEE OF A MILITARY FAMILY I NODDED MY THANKS AND STROLLED BACK TO ELSIE'S
OF COURSE YOU WILL TEACH SAID ELSIE PETHERIDGE WHEN I EXPLAINED MY AFFAIRS TO HER THERE IS A GOOD DEMAND JUST NOW FOR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST TEACH ELSIE
SHE KNEW WHAT I MEANT IT WAS GENTLE AND PENSIVE BUT IT LACKED INITIATIVE SO WHEN WE HAD FINISHED THAT WALL I POPPED ON MY BEST HAT AND POPPED OUT BY MYSELF INTO KENSINGTON GARDENS
A COLD DRAUGHT RUNS SO OFTEN ALONG THE FLOOR IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES THIS IS KENT THAT WE TRAVERSE AH THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND AS A DIPLOMAT HE KNEW EVERY NOOK OF EUROPE AND HE ECHOED THE MOT HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY HEARD DROP FROM MADAME'S LIPS ON THE PLATFORM

CLOSED A LITTLE MORE PARFAITEMENT THERE WAS A CURRENT OF AIR IL FAUT L'ADMETTRE MADAME WOULD PREFER THE CORNER NO THEN PERHAPS SHE WOULD LIKE THIS VALISE FOR A FOOTSTOOL PERMETTEZ JUST THUS
THEN AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AN UNSOPHISTICATED LITTLE GRETCHEN OF THE TAUNUS AT SCHLANGENBAD I SUPPOSE THERE ARE UNSOPHISTICATED GIRLS IN GERMANY STILL MADE IN GERMANY
TO ALLOW OF ONE'S PLACING ANY VERY HIGH VALUE UPON IT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST ADMIT I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALARMED NATURE HAD ENDOWED ME WITH A PROFUSION OF CRISP BLACK HAIR AND PLENTY OF HIGH SPIRITS
THOSE LITTLE LIPS COULD NEVER FRAME THEMSELVES TO SCHLECHT OR WUNDERSCHOEN THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT FOR IT PARDON ME I ANSWERED IN GERMAN WHAT I SAY THAT I MEAN THE NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MUSIC OF THE FATHERLAND'S SPEECH
OH I REMEMBER YOUR NAME WELL THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY BROKE IN I THINK YOU KNEW MY HUSBAND SIR EVELYN FAWLEY AND MY FATHER LORD KYNASTON THE COUNT LOOKED PROFOUNDLY SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED
I AM TOLD I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ALARMED AT THE STRAITS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY ONE ALONE IN THE WORLD
AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
I DON'T OBJECT TO GOING TO SCHLANGENBAD I WOULD CONVOY YOU OVER AS COMPANION OR LADY HELP OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT I WOULD REMAIN WITH YOU THERE FOR A WEEK TILL YOU COULD ARRANGE WITH YOUR GRETCHEN PRESUMABLY UNSOPHISTICATED
TO MAKE UP FOR IT HE TALKED MUCH AND WITH ANIMATION TO LADY GEORGINA THEY FERRETED OUT FRIENDS IN COMMON AND WERE AS MUCH SURPRISED AT IT AS PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AT THAT INEVITABLE EXPERIENCE AH YES MADAME I RECOLLECT HIM WELL IN VIENNA
COMMEND ME TO THE NOBLE DOWAGER
NO MADAME I HAVE QUITTED THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
THEY JUST GO TO THE PRIEST AND CONFESS YOU KNOW AND WIPE IT ALL OUT AND START FRESH AGAIN ON A CAREER OF CRIME NEXT MORNING I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER GO ABROAD THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FIT TO LIVE IN IS ENGLAND
SHE GREW PURPLE IN THE FACE WITH INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT THAT A CASUAL OUTSIDER SHOULD VENTURE TO ADDRESS HER SO MUCH SO INDEED
AFTER THAT HE CARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER OFF TO BURMA AND WHEN HE AND THE CLIMATE BETWEEN THEM HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HER HE MADE UP FOR HIS APPROPRIATIONS AT THE CHEAPEST RATE BY ALLOWING ME JUST ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO GIRTON
YOU NEVER WILL LEARN WHAT I MEAN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE NO NO I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE WHAT ADVENTURE MAY COME I HAVE NOT AT THIS MOMENT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
AND I SAID TO HER IN MY ICIEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW ICY I CAN BE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS IT' THE SECOND OLD LADY NODDED AN UNGRUDGING ASSENT AS IF PERFECTLY PREPARED TO ADMIT HER FRIEND'S RARE GIFT OF ICINESS
BY MONDAY I HAD PAPERED AND FURNISHED THE ROOMS AND WAS READY TO START ON MY VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION I MET THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY AT CHARING CROSS BY APPOINTMENT AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER LUGGAGE AND TICKETS
I NATURALLY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IT WAS MY STEPFATHER'S DEATH THAT DROVE ME TO IT I HAD NEVER SEEN MY STEPFATHER INDEED
YOU HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER INSTEAD OF HER WAITING UPON YOU SHE GETS SEASICK ON THE CROSSING AND WHEN SHE REACHES FRANCE OR GERMANY SHE HATES THE MEALS AND SHE DETESTS THE HOTEL SERVANTS AND SHE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
YOU WILL DROP THAT BASKET I HOPE YOU HAVE GOT THROUGH TICKETS VIA MALINES NOT BY BRUSSELS I WON'T GO BY BRUSSELS YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THERE NOW MIND YOU NOTICE HOW MUCH THE LUGGAGE WEIGHS IN ENGLISH POUNDS
SHE WORE COFFEE COLOURED POINT LACE IN HER BONNET WITH A COMPLEXION TO MATCH BUT WHAT COULD I DO MY DEAR I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUT UP WITH SUCH INSOLENCE SO I LOOKED HER STRAIGHT BACK IN THE FACE OH SHE QUAILED I CAN TELL YOU
SHE HAS AN AWFUL TEMPER THAT'S NOTHING SO HAVE I APPALLING I ASSURE YOU AND IF IT COMES TO BLOWS I'M BIGGER AND YOUNGER AND STRONGER THAN SHE IS WELL I WISH YOU WELL OUT OF IT THANK YOU
AS I WALKED OFF WELL PLEASED LADY GEORGINA'S FRIEND RAN AFTER ME QUICKLY YOU MUST TAKE CARE SHE SAID IN A WARNING VOICE YOU'VE CAUGHT A TARTAR SO I SUSPECT I ANSWERED
I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE GEORGINA IT OUGHT TO BE MADE PENAL TO SEND INNOCENT GIRLS INTO THE WORLD SO BURDENED MY OPINION TO A T YOU ARE REALLY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMAN THERE'S MY NAME AND ADDRESS
THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN
AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
ALL LIGHT WHOLESOME FOOD SUITABLE FOR THE SICK BUT THE WINE SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO FURNISHES THE WINE YOUR HOST THAT IS TO SAY YES AND NO HOW YES AND NO
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THEREFORE SERVED WITH MIRACULOUS CELERITY THE REGIMENT OF THE GUARDS WAS RECRUITED AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE KINGDOM AND D'ARTAGNAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY AND TRAVELING WITH FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
REJOICING TO THE SMELL IN ADDITION TO THIS HE PERCEIVED THAT THE TOP OF A WARDROBE AND THE MARBLE OF A COMMODE WERE COVERED WITH EMPTY BOTTLES AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND PORTHOS UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF JOY
AND DESIRED THE HOST TO BRING HIM A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND AS GOOD A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE A DESIRE WHICH FURTHER CORROBORATED THE HIGH OPINION THE INNKEEPER HAD FORMED OF THE TRAVELER AT FIRST SIGHT
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
WHEN WAR CAME AND CARRIED ME AWAY I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR ME AND EVEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY MEMORY WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS MARRIED THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MOST MEN WHO HAVE PASSED TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
BEFORE STARTING OUT WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE NAP REMEMBER TO CALL US AT MIDNIGHT SHARP FOR WE MUST CONTINUE ON OUR JOURNEY YES SIR ANSWERED THE INNKEEPER WINKING IN A KNOWING WAY AT THE FOX AND THE CAT AS IF TO SAY I UNDERSTAND
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY AND MY FATHER IN HIS LEISURE TIME WAS SOMETHING OF A POACHER
SAID THE COUNTESS WITHOUT REPLYING TO THE QUESTION NO MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BUT YOU SEE I MAKE NO RESISTANCE WE ARE GOING TO THE GREENHOUSE THAT YOU SEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE GROVE
BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
DO NOT MY MOTHER AND YOU AGREE ASKED ALBERT ASTONISHED ON THE CONTRARY REPLIED THE COUNT DID YOU NOT HEAR HER DECLARE THAT WE WERE FRIENDS THEY RE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
DON'T BE AFRAID HE IS NOT SO MUCH OF A DEVIL AS HE APPEARS
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
HE ASSISTED HIM TO RISE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND DISAPPEARED SO IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN THIS STRANGER MEANT TO QUARREL IT APPEARS SO
ROUND ABOUT HIM NOT A LEAF STIRRED A FEW BATS SKIMMED HIS NOSE NOW AND AGAIN AND SCARED HIM HALF TO DEATH
WHERE DID MY GOOD FRIENDS SAY THEY WOULD WAIT FOR ME HE ADDED
THIS TIME HE HAD DECIDED TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD PASSED
INDEED YES THEY WENT TWO HOURS AGO WHY IN SUCH A HURRY UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM WHICH SAID THAT HIS FIRST BORN WAS SUFFERING FROM CHILBLAINS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH
THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE WHO PROMISE YOU WEALTH OVERNIGHT MY BOY AS A RULE THEY ARE EITHER FOOLS OR SWINDLERS LISTEN TO ME AND GO HOME
YOUR LORDSHIP MUST HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY WHY TO BE SURE HE PROMISED TO REJOIN US AND WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM HE HAS DONE US THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE WHAT HE HAD DONE YOU THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME IN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW PLANCHET DEMANDED D'ARTAGNAN OH I GIVE YOU A HUNDRED I GIVE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES TO GUESS MONSIEUR THE VISIT I RECEIVED IN YOUR ABSENCE WHEN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO WHILE YOU WERE AT MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE'S
NOW I TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL PARTICULARLY ON THIS ROAD AND I WISH TO SEE ALL INNKEEPERS MAKING A FORTUNE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID THE HOST THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING MONSIEUR BAH I HAVE PASSED PERHAPS TEN TIMES THROUGH CHANTILLY
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
A MAN IS NOT PRIVILEGED IN ALL WAYS SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU KNOW THE PROVERB UNLUCKY AT PLAY LUCKY IN LOVE
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
THIS PROBABILITY AFFORDED HIM HIS FIRST CONSOLATION IF BONACIEUX KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE WAS ONE MIGHT BY EXTREME MEANS FORCE THE MERCER TO OPEN HIS TEETH AND LET HIS SECRET ESCAPE
I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
MY FRIEND PLACED A BOTTLE AT THE DISTANCE OF THIRTY PACES AND AT EACH CAST HE CAUGHT THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE IN HIS RUNNING NOOSE I PRACTICED THIS EXERCISE AND AS NATURE HAS ENDOWED ME WITH SOME FACULTIES AT THIS DAY I CAN THROW THE LASSO WITH ANY MAN IN THE WORLD WELL
WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD FINISHED HE SAID HUM ALL THIS SAVORS OF HIS EMINENCE A LEAGUE OFF BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID D'ARTAGNAN NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT QUITTING PARIS AS I TOLD YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
WHY I WAS HERE ONLY TEN OR TWELVE DAYS AGO I WAS CONDUCTING SOME FRIENDS MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM BY THE BY HAD A DISPUTE WITH A STRANGER
ANSWERED THE LITTLE BEING IN A FAINT VOICE THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT CAME FROM A FAR AWAY WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE MARIONETTE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS OF GOOD ADVICE
WHAT CONSEQUENCE CAN THE REVERSES OF FORTUNE BE TO YOU HAVE YOU NOT HAPPY ROGUE THAT YOU ARE
THE GRAPES WERE NO OTHER THAN GOLD COINS WHICH TINKLED MERRILY AS THEY SWAYED IN THE WIND THEY SEEMED TO SAY
WELL HE COMES TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHY SO
NO ONE TOLD ME YOU WERE
AS HE WAS SO IN NEED OF STRENGTH HE HAD TO HAVE FOUR MORE HELPINGS OF BUTTER AND CHEESE THE FOX AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF COAXING TRIED HIS BEST TO EAT A LITTLE THE DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON A DIET AND HE HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SMALL HARE
I CANNOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR WHAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME SURELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON YES BUT IN OUR SITUATION WE MUST NOT SAY ALL WE KNOW PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT OUR EARS SHOULD ANSWER FOR OUR TONGUES
I HATE THEM NOT AT ALL WHY SHOULD I THE COUNTESS PLACED HERSELF BEFORE MONTE CRISTO STILL HOLDING IN HER HAND A PORTION OF THE PERFUMED GRAPES TAKE SOME SHE SAID
HE ADOPTED A MIXED BELIEF WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO BE SOMETIMES CATHOLIC SOMETIMES A HUGUENOT
AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
I HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY MADAME ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO BUT NOW YOU ARE HAPPY DOUBTLESS REPLIED THE COUNT SINCE NO ONE HEARS ME COMPLAIN AND YOUR PRESENT HAPPINESS HAS IT SOFTENED YOUR HEART
THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR HOLY RELIGION FOR MY PART MONSIEUR I AM CATHOLIC MY FATHER FAITHFUL TO HIS PRINCIPLES HAVING MADE MY ELDER BROTHER A HUGUENOT
THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IMMEDIATELY PREVAILED IN HIS MIND HE LOWERED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELER THEN WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM HE COMMENCED A CONVERSATION WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS ENDED BY THE TRAVELER'S ABANDONING HIS PURSE TO SAVE HIS LIFE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
WELL YOUNG MAN SAID HE WE APPEAR TO PASS RATHER GAY NIGHTS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PESTE YOU SEEM TO REVERSE ORDINARY CUSTOMS AND COME HOME AT THE HOUR WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT
MADAME I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES REPLIED MONTE CRISTO AS IF THE SUBJECT HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE THE COUNTESS DASHED THE GRAPES INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR INFLEXIBLE MAN SHE MURMURED
AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING BEING PEOPLE OF GREAT REFINEMENT THEY DID NOT WANT TO OFFEND YOU SO DEEPLY AS NOT TO ALLOW YOU THE HONOR OF PAYING THE BILL TOO BAD
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
THIS LACKEY WAS MY COMPATRIOT AND WE BECAME THE MORE INTIMATE FROM THERE BEING MANY RESEMBLANCES OF CHARACTER BETWEEN US WE LOVED SPORTING OF ALL KINDS BETTER THAN ANYTHING SO THAT HE RELATED TO ME HOW IN THE PLAINS OF THE PAMPAS THE NATIVES HUNT THE TIGER AND THE WILD BULL
NO FATHER I HAVE NO ONE HOW CAN YOU EXIST THUS WITHOUT ANY ONE TO ATTACH YOU TO LIFE IT IS NOT MY FAULT MADAME AT MALTA I LOVED A YOUNG GIRL WAS ON THE POINT OF MARRYING HER
IT HAS SO CHANCED THAT I MET WITH A SPANIARD IN MY PEREGRINATIONS WHO HAD SEEN MANY COUNTRIES AND AMONG THEM THE NEW WORLD WHAT CONNECTION CAN THE NEW WORLD HAVE WITH THE BOTTLES WHICH ARE ON THE COMMODE AND THE WARDROBE PATIENCE MONSIEUR EVERYTHING WILL COME IN ITS TURN
AND WHAT WAS THE END OF THIS WORTHY MAN ASKED D'ARTAGNAN OH OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE KIND MONSIEUR ONE DAY HE WAS SURPRISED IN A LONELY ROAD BETWEEN A HUGUENOT AND A CATHOLIC WITH BOTH OF WHOM HE HAD BEFORE HAD BUSINESS
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL ARABIAN CUSTOM WHICH MAKES ETERNAL FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TOGETHER EATEN BREAD AND SALT UNDER THE SAME ROOF I KNOW IT MADAME REPLIED THE COUNT BUT WE ARE IN FRANCE AND NOT IN ARABIA
THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
RAISED HIS HEAD AT THE MENTION OF THIS DATE WHERE WERE YOU BORN CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT
HIS EYE RESTED LONGER ON THE PRESIDENT AND STILL MORE SO ON THE KING'S ATTORNEY BY THE SIDE OF ANDREA WAS STATIONED THE LAWYER WHO WAS TO CONDUCT HIS DEFENCE AND WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE COURT FOR ANDREA DISDAINED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THOSE DETAILS TO WHICH HE APPEARED TO ATTACH NO IMPORTANCE
I AM IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY SENSES SIR HE SAID MY BODY ALONE SUFFERS AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE I ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF GUILTY OF ALL THE YOUNG MAN HAS BROUGHT AGAINST ME AND FROM THIS HOUR HOLD MYSELF UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE PROCUREUR WHO WILL SUCCEED ME
A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PRISONER INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO THE TERROR
GENTLEMEN I KNOW I AM IN THE HANDS OF AN AVENGING GOD WE NEED NO PROOFS EVERYTHING RELATING TO THIS YOUNG MAN IS TRUE A DULL GLOOMY SILENCE LIKE THAT WHICH PRECEDES SOME AWFUL PHENOMENON OF NATURE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY WHO SHUDDERED IN DISMAY
THAT IS WHY I HAVE UTTERED THE WORDS FOR WHICH YOU BLAME ME
HE SAW WHILE HIS EYES DILATED WITH SURPRISE
AND NOW PRISONER WILL YOU CONSENT TO TELL YOUR NAME SAID THE PRESIDENT THE BRUTAL AFFECTATION WITH WHICH YOU HAVE ENUMERATED AND CLASSIFIED YOUR CRIMES CALLS FOR A SEVERE REPRIMAND ON THE PART OF THE COURT BOTH IN THE NAME OF MORALITY
HIS TRANSFORMATION A REVIEW OF HIS LIFE FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD WERE SET FORTH WITH ALL THE TALENT THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN LIFE COULD FURNISH TO A MIND LIKE THAT OF THE PROCUREUR BENEDETTO WAS THUS FOREVER CONDEMNED IN PUBLIC OPINION BEFORE THE SENTENCE OF THE LAW COULD BE PRONOUNCED
FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR SINCE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE PRISON
THE SNEERS OF THE SCUM OF THE CROWD ALWAYS SURE TO RISE TO THE SURFACE IN CASE OF ANY DISTURBANCE ALL THIS LASTED FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE DOOR KEEPERS AND MAGISTRATES WERE ABLE TO RESTORE SILENCE IN THE MIDST OF THIS TUMULT THE VOICE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS HEARD TO EXCLAIM
TO PREVENT A VISITOR FROM SHAKING HANDS WITH OR PASSING ANYTHING TO THE PRISONERS IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET
OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT FOR THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS IT IS A LONG RECTANGLE DIVIDED BY TWO UPRIGHT GRATINGS PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER
THERE CROUCHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WALL WHICH ATTRACTS AND RETAINS THE MOST HEAT THEY MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BUT MORE FREQUENTLY ALONE WATCHING THE DOOR WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE
KING'S ATTORNEY YES AND IF YOU WISH TO KNOW HIS NAME I WILL TELL IT
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND
THE KEEPER TURNED HIS BACK AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE DID NOT EVEN LAUGH AT WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ANY ONE ELSE TO DO SO HE HAD HEARD SO MANY UTTER THE SAME THINGS INDEED HE HEARD NOTHING ELSE COME SAID ANDREA YOU ARE A MAN VOID OF COMPASSION
BUT HOW HAVE YOU BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THESE DETAILS ASKED THE PRESIDENT I WILL TELL YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A MAN WHO HAD SWORN VENGEANCE AGAINST MY FATHER AND HAD LONG WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY TO KILL HIM HAD INTRODUCED HIMSELF THAT NIGHT INTO THE GARDEN IN WHICH MY FATHER BURIED ME
THAN THAT WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE PRISONER THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE INDICTMENT REVISED AS WE KNOW BY THE CLEVER AND IMPLACABLE PEN OF VILLEFORT DURING THE READING OF THIS WHICH WAS LONG THE PUBLIC ATTENTION WAS CONTINUALLY DRAWN TOWARDS ANDREA WHO BORE THE INSPECTION WITH SPARTAN UNCONCERN
I DID NOT EVEN WISH TO KNOW HER NAME NOR DO I KNOW IT JUST THEN A PIERCING CRY ENDING IN A SOB BURST FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CROWD WHO ENCIRCLED THE LADY WHO HAD BEFORE FAINTED AND WHO NOW FELL INTO A VIOLENT FIT OF HYSTERICS SHE WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE HALL THE THICK VEIL WHICH CONCEALED HER FACE DROPPED OFF
THIS SUDDEN FORTUNE THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I HAVE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES AN UNEXPECTED FAMILY AND AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME AWARDED TO ME GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME
EVERY ONE TURNED TOWARDS THE PROCUREUR WHO UNABLE TO BEAR THE UNIVERSAL GAZE NOW RIVETED ON HIM ALONE ADVANCED STAGGERING INTO THE MIDST OF THE TRIBUNAL WITH HIS HAIR DISHEVELLED AND HIS FACE INDENTED WITH THE MARK OF HIS NAILS THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY UTTERED A LONG MURMUR OF ASTONISHMENT
THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING LA SAVATE LA SAVATE A CRUEL OPERATION WHICH CONSISTS IN CUFFING A COMRADE WHO MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO DISGRACE NOT WITH AN OLD SHOE BUT WITH AN IRON HEELED ONE
AS HE STEPPED INTO THE OBLONG AND GRATED VEHICLE WHICH THEY CALL THE SALAD BASKET NEVER MIND WE SHALL SEE TO MORROW THEN HE ADDED TURNING TOWARDS BERTUCCIO
YOUR AGE REPEATED THE PRESIDENT
NO IT IS USELESS HOW USELESS CRIED THE PRESIDENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ANDREA MADE NO RESISTANCE ALTHOUGH HE PROTESTED AGAINST IT SUDDENLY A VOICE WAS HEARD AT THE WICKET BENEDETTO EXCLAIMED AN INSPECTOR THE KEEPER RELAXED HIS HOLD I AM CALLED SAID ANDREA TO THE VISITORS ROOM SAID THE SAME VOICE
AND THE JURY MANIFESTED TOKENS OF DISGUST FOR CYNICISM SO UNEXPECTED IN A MAN OF FASHION
YOU SEE SOME ONE PAYS ME A VISIT AH MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL SEE WHETHER A CAVALCANTI IS TO BE TREATED LIKE A COMMON PERSON AND ANDREA GLIDING THROUGH THE COURT LIKE A BLACK SHADOW RUSHED OUT THROUGH THE WICKET LEAVING HIS COMRADES AND EVEN THE KEEPER LOST IN WONDER
I AM NO COMRADE OF THESE PEOPLE SAID THE YOUNG MAN PROUDLY YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INSULT ME THUS
AND HE POLISHED HIS VARNISHED BOOTS WITH THE CORNER OF A HANDKERCHIEF EMBROIDERED WITH INITIALS SURMOUNTED BY A CORONET SOME OF THE INMATES OF THE LIONS DEN WERE WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISONER'S TOILET WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
WELL BE IT SO YOU HAVE CONTINUED YOUR COURSE OF VILLANY YOU HAVE ROBBED YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED WELL I SHOULD SAY IF YOU HAD ME TAKEN TO A PRIVATE ROOM ONLY TO TELL ME THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS
YOUR NAME AND SURNAME ANDREA AROSE EXCUSE ME MISTER PRESIDENT HE SAID IN A CLEAR VOICE BUT I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO ADOPT A COURSE OF QUESTIONS THROUGH WHICH I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU I HAVE AN IDEA
THEY ASK MY NAME I CANNOT GIVE IT SINCE MY PARENTS ABANDONED ME BUT THOUGH I CANNOT GIVE MY OWN NAME NOT POSSESSING ONE I CAN TELL THEM MY FATHER'S
NOW BURST FORTH LIKE THUNDER FROM THE BREASTS OF ALL PRESENT THE COURT ITSELF DID NOT SEEK TO RESTRAIN THE FEELINGS OF THE AUDIENCE THE EXCLAMATIONS THE INSULTS ADDRESSED TO BENEDETTO WHO REMAINED PERFECTLY UNCONCERNED THE ENERGETIC GESTURES THE MOVEMENT OF THE GENDARMES
OH CRIED ANDREA LEAPING WITH JOY THEN HE MENTALLY ADDED STILL MY UNKNOWN PROTECTOR I AM NOT FORGOTTEN THEY WISH FOR SECRECY
THE ONE BY A MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE MANAGED THROUGH BRIBERY THE OTHER BY BUYING OFF MY JUDGES WITH GOLD I WILL SAY AND DO NOTHING UNTIL I AM CONVINCED THAT HE HAS QUITE ABANDONED ME AND THEN ANDREA HAD FORMED A PLAN WHICH WAS TOLERABLY CLEVER
LOOKED AT BENEDETTO AS IF HE HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE HEAD OF MEDUSA AND BECAME LIVID AS FOR BENEDETTO HE GRACEFULLY WIPED HIS LIPS WITH A FINE CAMBRIC POCKET HANDKERCHIEF YOUR PROFESSION FIRST I WAS A FORGER ANSWERED ANDREA AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE
I WILL RETURN TO MORROW SAID BERTUCCIO GOOD GENDARMES I AM AT YOUR SERVICE AH SIR DO LEAVE A FEW CROWNS FOR ME AT THE GATE THAT I MAY HAVE SOME THINGS I AM IN NEED OF IT SHALL BE DONE REPLIED BERTUCCIO
HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUG SAID ANOTHER DRESSES IN FINE STYLE AND THEN TO BE HERE SO YOUNG OH WHAT LARKS MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THIS HIDEOUS ADMIRATION APPROACHED THE WICKET AGAINST WHICH ONE OF THE KEEPERS WAS LEANING
ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS THE MEN WHOM JUSTICE HOLDS BENEATH THE STEEL SHE IS SHARPENING
IN HIS SOFTEST VOICE AND MOST POLITE MANNER THIS IS INDEED THE REASON WHY I BEGGED YOU TO ALTER THE ORDER OF THE QUESTIONS THE PUBLIC ASTONISHMENT HAD REACHED ITS HEIGHT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DECEIT OR BRAVADO IN THE MANNER OF THE ACCUSED
FROM THAT WHICH HAD BEEN EXPECTED DURING THE LAST FORTNIGHT BY THE PARISIAN WORLD WELL SAID BEAUCHAMP LET THEM NOW SAY THAT DRAMA IS UNNATURAL MA FOI SAID CHATEAU RENAUD
CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THE LIONS DEN ONE DIVISION OF LA FORCE IN WHICH THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DESPERATE PRISONERS ARE CONFINED IS CALLED THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD THE PRISONERS IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN
COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY
OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE PRISONERS ANY ONE CAN SEE HE'S A GENTLEMAN
THEN I BECAME A THIEF AND LATELY HAVE BECOME AN ASSASSIN A MURMUR OR RATHER STORM OF INDIGNATION BURST FROM ALL PARTS OF THE ASSEMBLY
OH YES THAT IS WELL AND BERTUCCIO FEELING IN HIS POCKET SIGNED TO A KEEPER WHOM HE SAW THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE WICKET READ HE SAID WHAT IS THAT ASKED ANDREA AN ORDER TO CONDUCT YOU TO A ROOM AND TO LEAVE YOU THERE TO TALK TO ME
THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR HE HAS TWO MEANS OF EXTRICATING ME FROM THIS DILEMMA
I'LL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT THIS MADE THE KEEPER TURN AROUND AND HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THE PRISONERS THEN APPROACHED AND FORMED A CIRCLE I TELL YOU THAT WITH THAT WRETCHED SUM CONTINUED ANDREA I COULD OBTAIN A COAT AND A ROOM IN WHICH TO RECEIVE THE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITOR I AM DAILY EXPECTING
THE KEEPER RETIRED NOW SAID THE STEWARD WHAT HAVE YOU TO TELL ME AND YOU SAID ANDREA YOU SPEAK FIRST
IT WAS TOO SOON FOR A VISIT FROM THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE AND TOO LATE FOR ONE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON OR THE DOCTOR IT MUST THEN BE THE VISITOR HE HOPED FOR
IT WAS NOT YOU WHO MANUFACTURED AN ITALIAN GENTLEMAN FOR MY FATHER
ANDREA PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE SUCCESSIVE CHARGES WHICH WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM
OR THE GALLEYS IN THE COURT WHICH WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE AND FROM WHICH A DAMP VAPOR WAS RISING A YOUNG MAN WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS WHO HAD EXCITED MUCH CURIOSITY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE DEN MIGHT BE SEEN WALKING
FATHER SAID BENEDETTO I AM ASKED FOR PROOFS DO YOU WISH ME TO GIVE THEM NO NO IT IS USELESS STAMMERED
THOUGH A STOVE A BED A CHAIR AND A TABLE FORMED THE WHOLE OF ITS SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE
BUT WHICH THEY CAN TAKE UP AGAIN INSTANTLY IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT THEIR MOVEMENTS MY FATHER I WILL KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS SAID THE OBSTINATE YOUTH I WILL PERISH IF I MUST BUT I WILL KNOW IT WHAT DOES SCANDAL SIGNIFY TO ME WHAT POSSESSIONS WHAT REPUTATION
AND AS HE SPOKE THESE WORDS WITH A HOARSE CHOKING VOICE HE STAGGERED TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH WAS MECHANICALLY OPENED BY A DOOR KEEPER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WERE DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE REVELATION AND CONFESSION WHICH HAD PRODUCED A CATASTROPHE SO DIFFERENT
I SAID ANYTHING I PLEASED IN ORDER THAT THE SOLEMN DECLARATION I HAVE JUST MADE SHOULD NOT BE WITHHELD WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN THE CASE I NOW REPEAT THAT I WAS BORN AT AUTEUIL ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN
THE PROOFS SAID BENEDETTO LAUGHING DO YOU WANT PROOFS YES
IT WAS NOT YOU IN FACT WHO BAILED ME FOR ONE OR TWO MILLIONS WHEN THE FATAL DISCOVERY OF MY LITTLE SECRET TOOK PLACE COME SPEAK MY WORTHY CORSICAN SPEAK WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO SAY
OF YOUR FATHER WHO CONSIGNED YOU TO HELL IF YOU DIED AND TO MISERY IF A MIRACLE PRESERVED YOU ALIVE
DO YOU WISH FOR ANY FURTHER DETAILS I WILL GIVE THEM
THE JUDGES TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE THE JURY TOOK THEIR SEATS
ONE DAY WHEN I CURSED PROVIDENCE FOR MAKING ME SO WICKED AND ORDAINING ME TO SUCH A FATE MY ADOPTED FATHER SAID TO ME
OTHERS PROPOSED THE ANGUILLE ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES AND TWO SOUS PIECES WHEN THEY HAVE THEM
AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS
HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP
I AM AFRAID SOME GREAT WAVE WILL LIFT ME OFF MY LEGS AND DASH ME AGAINST THE ROCKS AS I LEAVE THE WATER WHICH WOULD GIVE ME A SORRY LANDING IF ON THE OTHER HAND I SWIM FURTHER IN SEARCH OF SOME SHELVING BEACH OR HARBOUR
INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY
AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH LAND TAKE IT OFF THROW IT BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE SEA AND THEN GO AWAY AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS
MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT
DID AS HE WAS TOLD FORTHWITH HE BOUND ON HIS GLITTERING GOLDEN SANDALS WITH WHICH HE COULD FLY LIKE THE WIND OVER LAND AND SEA HE TOOK THE WAND WITH WHICH HE SEALS MEN'S EYES IN SLEEP
WHO COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO COME ALL THIS WAY OVER THE SEA WHERE THERE ARE NO CITIES FULL OF PEOPLE TO OFFER ME SACRIFICES OR CHOICE HECATOMBS
THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN
BOUNDED FORWARD ON HER WAY AS A FOUR IN HAND CHARIOT FLIES OVER THE COURSE WHEN THE HORSES FEEL THE WHIP HER PROW CURVETTED AS IT WERE THE NECK OF A STALLION AND A GREAT WAVE OF DARK BLUE WATER SEETHED IN HER WAKE
BUT ULYSSES WAS NOT WITHIN HE WAS ON THE SEA SHORE AS USUAL LOOKING OUT UPON THE BARREN OCEAN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES GROANING AND BREAKING HIS HEART FOR SORROW CALYPSO GAVE MERCURY A SEAT AND SAID
YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE
MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP
I AM AFRAID CALYPSO WAS RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE BY SEA BEFORE I GOT BACK HOME IT IS ALL COMING TRUE HOW BLACK IS JOVE MAKING HEAVEN WITH HIS CLOUDS AND WHAT A SEA THE WINDS ARE RAISING FROM EVERY QUARTER AT ONCE
LEAVE YOUR RAFT TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND AND SWIM TO THE PHAEACIAN COAST WHERE BETTER LUCK AWAITS YOU AND HERE TAKE MY VEIL AND PUT IT ROUND YOUR CHEST IT IS ENCHANTED AND YOU CAN COME TO NO HARM SO LONG AS YOU WEAR IT
THIS WILL STOP THEM FROM ESCORTING PEOPLE IN FUTURE AND I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BURY THEIR CITY UNDER A HUGE MOUNTAIN MY GOOD FRIEND ANSWERED JOVE I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY ARE WATCHING THE SHIP ON HER WAY
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
WHOSE WAVES HE SKIMMED LIKE A CORMORANT THAT FLIES FISHING EVERY HOLE AND CORNER OF THE OCEAN AND DRENCHING ITS THICK PLUMAGE IN THE SPRAY HE FLEW AND FLEW OVER MANY A WEARY WAVE BUT WHEN AT LAST
IF HE HAD HAD HIS SHARE OF THE SPOIL AND GOT HOME WITHOUT MISADVENTURE AND JOVE ANSWERED WHAT O LORD OF THE EARTHQUAKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF SUCH A HANDSOME PRESENT EVERY ONE APPROVED OF THIS AND THEN THEY WENT HOME TO BED EACH IN HIS OWN ABODE WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED
LOW LYING ROCKS AND MOUNTAIN TOPS ULYSSES HEART NOW BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE SAID DESPAIRINGLY TO HIMSELF ALAS JOVE HAS LET ME SEE LAND AFTER SWIMMING SO FAR THAT I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
HE GOT TO THE ISLAND WHICH WAS HIS JOURNEY'S END HE LEFT THE SEA AND WENT ON BY LAND TILL HE CAME TO THE CAVE WHERE THE NYMPH CALYPSO LIVED HE FOUND HER AT HOME THERE WAS A LARGE FIRE BURNING ON THE HEARTH
HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT
AND AT THE SAME TIME HE KEPT LOOKING TOWARDS THE SHORE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND SOME HAVEN OR A SPIT THAT SHOULD TAKE THE WAVES ASLANT BY AND BY AS HE SWAM ON HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A RIVER
WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP
THAT I MEAN YOU NO SORT OF HARM AND AM ONLY ADVISING YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IN YOUR PLACE I AM DEALING WITH YOU QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
THEREON HE GATHERED HIS CLOUDS TOGETHER GRASPED HIS TRIDENT STIRRED IT ROUND IN THE SEA AND ROUSED THE RAGE OF EVERY WIND THAT BLOWS TILL EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE HIDDEN IN CLOUD AND NIGHT SPRANG FORTH OUT OF THE HEAVENS
AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
WHICH THEN WENT TO PIECES AS THOUGH IT WERE A HEAP OF DRY CHAFF TOSSED ABOUT BY A WHIRLWIND ULYSSES GOT ASTRIDE OF ONE PLANK AND RODE UPON IT AS IF HE WERE ON HORSEBACK HE THEN TOOK OFF THE CLOTHES CALYPSO HAD GIVEN HIM
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
WHO WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND HE CANNOT GET BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HE CAN FIND NEITHER SHIPS NOR SAILORS TO TAKE HIM OVER THE SEA FURTHERMORE
HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
NEVERTHELESS I WILL READILY GIVE HIM SUCH ADVICE IN ALL GOOD FAITH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO BRING HIM SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THEN SEND HIM AWAY SAID MERCURY OR JOVE WILL BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND PUNISH YOU ON THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
THIS WILL ASTONISH EVERYBODY AND YOU CAN THEN BURY THEIR CITY UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WHEN EARTH ENCIRCLING NEPTUNE HEARD THIS HE WENT TO SCHERIA WHERE THE PHAEACIANS LIVE AND STAYED THERE TILL THE SHIP WHICH WAS MAKING RAPID WAY HAD GOT CLOSE IN
UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER
THE BOUNTEOUS EARTH ALAS HE CRIED TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME AND HOW IS IT ALL TO END IF I STAY HERE UPON THE RIVER BED THROUGH THE LONG WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
ON LATE SETTING BOOTES AND ON THE BEAR WHICH MEN ALSO CALL THE WAIN AND WHICH TURNS ROUND AND ROUND WHERE IT IS FACING ORION AND ALONE NEVER DIPPING INTO THE STREAM OF OCEANUS FOR CALYPSO HAD TOLD HIM TO KEEP THIS TO HIS LEFT
FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO
CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT
ALL HIS PRIZE MONEY AND HAD GOT HOME WITHOUT DISASTER THIS IS HOW WE HAVE SETTLED THAT HE SHALL RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AND HIS FRIENDS THUS HE SPOKE AND MERCURY GUIDE AND GUARDIAN SLAYER OF ARGUS
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
THAT WOULD HAVE IT SO AS FOR THE DAY TIME HE SPENT IT ON THE ROCKS AND ON THE SEA SHORE WEEPING CRYING ALOUD FOR HIS DESPAIR AND ALWAYS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA
AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF
HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT
AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE
THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES REJOICE WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN AND HE AT ONCE SAID TO THE PHAEACIANS ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO KING ALCINOUS SIR AND ALL OF YOU FAREWELL
I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
TO HIS GRAY MARE AND RODE AWAY THE VERY NEXT DAY TO MARY'S GREAT SURPRISE AND GRIEF SHE FOUND THE LEAVES OF THE DINGLE BELLS CURLING AND BEGINNING TO WITHER OH MAMMA SHE CALLED COME QUICK
YOUR FATHER MEANT YOU TO WATCH THE FLOWERS IN THE FIELD AND IF YOU WILL COME AND VISIT THEM EACH DAY YOU WILL FIND THE TIME WAITING VERY SHORT INDEED MARY DRIED HER EYES AND THANKED THE KINDLY OLD SQUIRE
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARY AND HER MOTHER HAD DRIED THEIR EYES WHICH HAD BEEN WET WITH GRIEF AT THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR LOVED ONES THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED EARNESTLY MAMMA MAY I MAKE A FLOWER GARDEN
YES MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN WITH PERFECT SERENITY IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED
THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE DANCERS BUT THE HIGH FEATHERS OF SOME OF THE LADIES STILL THEY MOVED ON SOMETHING BETTER WAS YET IN VIEW AND BY A CONTINUED EXERTION OF STRENGTH AND INGENUITY
IN WHICH DWELT A SAILOR AND HIS WIFE WITH THEIR TWO STRONG SONS AND A LITTLE GIRL THE SONS WERE ALSO SAILORS AND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THEIR FATHER IN A PRETTY SHIP CALLED THE SKYLARK
IT MAY BE STATED FOR THE READER'S MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION LEST THE FOLLOWING PAGES SHOULD OTHERWISE FAIL OF GIVING ANY IDEA OF WHAT HER CHARACTER IS MEANT TO BE THAT HER HEART WAS AFFECTIONATE HER DISPOSITION CHEERFUL AND OPEN
AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
WHEN YOU COME FROM THE ROOMS AT NIGHT AND I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BOOK ON PURPOSE SALLY OR RATHER SARAH
AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME THAT ANYBODY SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE EVENING TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED AND JOINED BY MISTER ALLEN WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER WELL MISS MORLAND SAID HE DIRECTLY I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD AN AGREEABLE BALL
I WISH YOU COULD DANCE MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER FOR SOME TIME HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES BUT THEY WERE REPEATED SO OFTEN
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW HIGH UPON A CLIFF THAT OVERLOOKED THE SEA WAS A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE
I SHALL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE AND WATCH THE GARDEN GROW
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN UP BIG AND STRONG SAID MARY ONE MORNING AS SHE WEEDED THE BED AND WHEN THEY HAVE BUDDED AND BLOSSOMED AND FADED AWAY AGAIN THEN PAPA AND MY BROTHERS WILL COME HOME AND I SHALL CALL THE COCKLE SHELLS PAPA
I WANT THEM IN FRONT PERSISTED MARY FOR THE SUN SHINES STRONGER THERE VERY WELL ANSWERED HER MOTHER MAKE YOUR GARDEN AT THE FRONT IF YOU WILL
SHE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THE EVENING PLEASANTER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IT BEFORE HER HUMBLE VANITY WAS CONTENTED SHE FELT MORE OBLIGED TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN FOR THIS SIMPLE PRAISE THAN A TRUE QUALITY HEROINE
AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
MISTRESS MARY SO CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY BEING A SHARP LITTLE GIRL AND KNOWING THE SQUIRE'S QUEER WAYS
AND HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE THE HOURS WERE VERY DULL AND TEDIOUS AND MARY COUNTED THE DAYS UNTIL THE SAILORS CAME HOME AGAIN ONE SPRING
AND THE WARM MORNING SUN USUALLY DROVE AWAY THE WINDS BUT HER MOTHER KNEW IT AND FEARED MARY'S GARDEN WOULD SUFFER ONE DAY MARY CAME INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HER MOTHER WAS AT WORK AND SAID GLEEFULLY
PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
NOR WAS SHE ONCE CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS AND HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME
AND PROVED SO TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL THAT CATHERINE GREW TIRED AT LAST AND WOULD THANK HER NO MORE THEY WERE NOT LONG ABLE HOWEVER TO ENJOY THE REPOSE OF THE EMINENCE THEY HAD SO LABORIOUSLY GAINED
SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT I AM AFRAID NO INDEED IT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT
AND AFTER THAT SHE VISITED THE FIELDS EACH DAY AND WATCHED THE FLOWERS GROW AND IT WAS NOT SO VERY LONG AS THE SQUIRE SAID BEFORE THE BLOSSOMS BEGAN TO WITHER AND FALL AWAY AND FINALLY ONE DAY MARY LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA
SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
BUT MISSUS MORLAND KNEW SO LITTLE OF LORDS AND BARONETS THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO NOTION OF THEIR GENERAL MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND WAS WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF DANGER TO HER DAUGHTER FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS
BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD IT SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON
WHO HAD HEARD WHAT THE SAILOR HAD SAID TO HIS LITTLE GIRL KNEW AT ONCE WHAT MARY MEANT SO SHE KISSED HER DAUGHTER AND REPLIED YES MARY YOU MAY HAVE THE FLOWER GARDEN IF YOU WISH WE WILL DIG A NICE LITTLE BED JUST AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
THEY LOOKED RATHER COMICAL ALL STANDING IN STIFF STRAIGHT ROWS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT MARY DID NOT MIND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WORKING SHE HEARD THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LOOKING UP
SHE WAS INCLINED TO BE A BIT CONTRARY AND PUT HER OWN OPINIONS AND IDEAS BEFORE THOSE OF HER ELDERS PERHAPS MARY MEANT NO WRONG IN THIS
AND NOW MY PAPA'S COMING HOME FOR SO HE SURELY SAID AH SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING AT HER CURIOUSLY I M AFRAID YOU ARE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF TIME SEE HERE MARY
CAUTIONS AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM HOUSE MUST AT SUCH A MOMENT RELIEVE THE FULNESS OF HER HEART WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO
AND WHEN ALL THESE MATTERS WERE ARRANGED THE IMPORTANT EVENING CAME WHICH WAS TO USHER HER INTO THE UPPER ROOMS HER HAIR WAS CUT AND DRESSED BY THE BEST HAND HER CLOTHES PUT ON WITH CARE
ARE ALL WITHERED AND FADED AWAY AND DID YOU NOT SAY THAT GOD WILLING WHEN THIS HAPPENED YOU WOULD COME BACK TO US TO BE SURE I DID ANSWERED HER FATHER WITH A HAPPY LAUGH AND I MUST HAVE SPOKEN TRULY SWEETHEART
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
I WISH WE HAD ANY IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY TO GO TO VERY TRUE MY DEAR AND IF WE KNEW ANYBODY WE WOULD JOIN THEM DIRECTLY THE SKINNERS WERE HERE LAST YEAR I WISH THEY WERE HERE NOW
AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED THEM TO THE HOTEL SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET
GARDENS ARE ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR FANCY FLOWERS TO GROW IN BUT THE POSIES THAT GOD GAVE TO ALL THE WORLD AND MADE TO GROW WILD IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF NATURE
AND BOTH MISSUS ALLEN AND HER MAID DECLARED SHE LOOKED QUITE AS SHE SHOULD DO WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT CATHERINE HOPED AT LEAST TO PASS UNCENSURED THROUGH THE CROWD AS FOR ADMIRATION
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE DRESS WAS HER PASSION SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE AND OUR HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE
MISSUS ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY THE DOOR AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW CATHERINE HOWEVER KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY
AND IN THE END SHE PLANTED THE DINGLE BELLS ALL IN ONE STRAIGHT ROW AND THE COCKLE SHELLS IN ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROW THE LENGTH OF THE BED AND SHE FINISHED BY PLANTING THE COWSLIPS IN ANOTHER LONG ROW AT THE BACK HER MOTHER SMILED BUT SAID NOTHING
AND DO YOU KNOW THE DINGLE BELLS THAT GROW NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WOOD HE ASKED AGAIN I KNOW THEM WELL PAPA
FOR WE BOTH SHALL BE GLAD TO WELCOME OUR DEAR ONES HOME AGAIN BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE CAME RIDING UP AS WAS HIS WONT TO WHERE MARY STOOD BY HER GARDEN AND HE AT ONCE ASKED
UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
INCOMMUNICATIVE AS HE WAS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF GAUGING HIS MIND
YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
THE LITTLE ONES WILL BE DELIGHTED THEN HE LIT A BIG PIPE AND BEGAN TO SMOKE AND SOON HE TOOK A ROLL OF SOFT FUR FROM A SHELF IN A CORNER AND COMMENCED TO CUT IT OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A RABBIT HE SMOKED AND WHISTLED ALL THE TIME HE WAS WORKING
AND THEN HE STUFFED THE FUR FULL OF SAWDUST AND SEWED IT UP NEATLY AFTER WHICH HE PUT IN SOME GLASS EYES THAT MADE THE TOY RABBIT LOOK WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE HE PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME
SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
AFTER I GOT HOME REPLIED THE RABBIT THE COLLAR DISAPPEARED FROM AROUND MY NECK AND I KNEW SANTA HAD CALLED IT BACK TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME YOU SEE HE MERELY LET ME TAKE IT ON MY JOURNEY TO PROTECT ME
ZEALOUS AS HE WAS HAD NOT YET FOUND THAT PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING HE HAD NO MORE FOUND IT I THOUGHT THAN HAD I WITH MY CONCEALED AND RACKING REGRETS FOR MY BROKEN IDOL AND LOST ELYSIUM
OH NO SAID I I PREFER TO RUN BY MYSELF FOR I CAN EASILY FIND THE WAY AND I WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY IF THAT IS THE CASE REPLIED SANTA I MUST GIVE YOU A MAGIC COLLAR TO WEAR SO THAT YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM
THEY WERE BOTH MORE ACCOMPLISHED AND BETTER READ THAN I WAS BUT WITH EAGERNESS I FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD TRODDEN BEFORE ME I DEVOURED THE BOOKS THEY LENT ME THEN IT WAS FULL SATISFACTION TO DISCUSS WITH THEM IN THE EVENING
OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT
MARY WOULD SIT AND WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
THAT EVER BORDERED A WILDERNESS OF HEATH OR GAVE SUSTENANCE TO A FLOCK OF GREY MOORLAND SHEEP WITH THEIR LITTLE MOSSY FACED LAMBS THEY CLUNG TO THIS SCENE I SAY WITH A PERFECT ENTHUSIASM OF ATTACHMENT
WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
CAME THE STRAP OVER TOM'S BACK OW OW CRIED THE BOY AND STARTED TO RUN DOWN THE STREET WHACK WHACK FELL THE STRAP OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR THE FARMER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS IN HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION I COULD TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED
IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
BUT NO TRACES OF THE PIG COULD HE FIND ANYWHERE AND THAT WAS NO GREAT WONDER FOR THE PIG WAS EATEN BY THAT TIME AND ITS BONES PICKED CLEAN FINALLY THE FARMER CAME TO THE END OF THE STREET WHERE THE PIPER LIVED IN HIS LITTLE HUT
NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
DIANA OFFERED TO TEACH ME GERMAN I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED ME NO LESS
AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
AS GOVERNESSES IN A LARGE FASHIONABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND CITY WHERE EACH HELD A SITUATION IN FAMILIES
FEARING AT FIRST THE NEW RABBIT WAS ALIVE OLD SANTA LAUGHED MERRILY AT THIS AND I SOON RECOVERED FROM MY FRIGHT AND WAS PLEASED TO THINK THE BABIES WERE TO HAVE SUCH PRETTY PLAYTHINGS
ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW GRANITE CRAG THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM
AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I PROPOSE TO MYSELF DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH
I MUST PUT A SQUEAK IN IT SAID SANTA SO HE TOOK A BOX OF SQUEAKS FROM A SHELF AND PUT ONE INTO THE RABBIT BEFORE HE SEWED IT UP WHEN IT WAS ALL FINISHED HE PRESSED THE TOY RABBIT WITH HIS THUMB AND IT SQUEAKED SO NATURALLY THAT I JUMPED OFF THE TABLE
ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND ONE MORNING BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE WINDOW RECESS
AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS SOMETHING NEW AMONGST THEM ONCE I VISITED SANTA AND SAW HIM MAKE THE TOYS
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
AND THEY WILL GO IN THREE DAYS NOW I SAID YES AND WHEN THEY GO I SHALL RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE AT MORTON HANNAH WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND THIS OLD HOUSE WILL BE SHUT UP
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE ON CHRISTMAS WE RABBITS SAYS BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY LITTLE DOROTHY HAD PASSED ALL THE FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
I LIVE IN THE GROUND FAR DOWN IN A COOL PLEASANT HOLE I HAVE DUG IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE IS THE NICEST LITTLE ROOM YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THERE I HAVE MADE A SOFT BED TO REST IN AT NIGHT
OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND YOU TO ACCEPT
BUT THAT IT WAS PERTURBED AND EXCITING MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE FREQUENT FLASH AND CHANGEFUL DILATION OF HIS EYE I THINK MOREOVER THAT NATURE WAS NOT TO HIM
TOM THE PIPER'S SON
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE PIPER HAD THE PIG KILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES AND BOILING IN THE POT ONLY THE TAIL WAS LEFT OUT FOR TOM WANTED TO MAKE A WHISTLE OF IT AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT BESIDES THE TAIL HIS FATHER LET HIM HAVE IT
THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED THE HEART WAS THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE SOFTENED THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS
ARTICLED CLERKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FLESHING THEIR LEGAL WIT UPON IT THE LAST LORD CHANCELLOR HANDLED IT NEATLY
LUDSHIP IS THE REPLY THAT SLIDES OUT OF MISTER TANGLE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BAR ARE STILL TO BE HEARD I BELIEVE SAYS THE CHANCELLOR WITH A SLIGHT SMILE
IN WHAT EXACT REMOVE HE IS A COUSIN BUT HE IS A COUSIN LEAVING THIS ADDRESS
AND IT WOULD NOT BE WONDERFUL TO MEET A MEGALOSAURUS FORTY FEET LONG OR SO
WITH ANY MORE BUT SHE HAD BEAUTY PRIDE AMBITION INSOLENT RESOLVE AND SENSE ENOUGH TO PORTION OUT A LEGION OF FINE LADIES WEALTH AND STATION ADDED TO THESE SOON FLOATED HER UPWARD
IT IS NOT SO UNLIKE THE COURT OF CHANCERY BUT THAT WE MAY PASS FROM THE ONE SCENE TO THE OTHER AS THE CROW FLIES BOTH THE WORLD OF FASHION AND THE COURT OF CHANCERY
THE SUBJECT WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS IGNORANTLY CONVICTED OF HAVING MURDERED HER BUT ON SOLEMN APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT HE WAS ACQUITTED BECAUSE IT WAS SHOWN UPON THE EVIDENCE
A SALLOW PRISONER HAS COME UP IN CUSTODY
WITH SERIOUS FACES AS PLAYERS MIGHT ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS SOLICITORS IN THE CAUSE SOME TWO OR THREE OF WHOM HAVE INHERITED IT FROM THEIR FATHERS
WHICH SO EXHAUSTS FINANCES PATIENCE COURAGE HOPE SO OVERTHROWS THE BRAIN AND BREAKS THE HEART THAT THERE IS NOT AN HONOURABLE MAN AMONG ITS PRACTITIONERS WHO WOULD NOT GIVE WHO DOES NOT OFTEN GIVE THE WARNING
WELL MAY THE COURT BE DIM WITH WASTING CANDLES HERE AND THERE WELL MAY THE FOG HANG HEAVY IN IT AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET OUT WELL MAY THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
BUT NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE NO ONE CARES SHE CARRIES SOME SMALL LITTER IN A RETICULE WHICH SHE CALLS HER DOCUMENTS PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF PAPER MATCHES AND DRY LAVENDER
TO WHAT IT WORKS IN LIKE THE DYER'S HAND PITY ME THEN AND WISH I WERE RENEWED BUT AS IT IS WHOLESOME THAT THE PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
ON YOUR GREAT COUNTY FAMILIES HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF STRICT CONSCIENCE DISDAINFUL OF ALL LITTLENESS AND MEANNESS AND READY ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE TO DIE ANY DEATH YOU MAY PLEASE TO MENTION
EIGHTEEN OF MISTER TANGLE'S LEARNED FRIENDS EACH ARMED WITH A LITTLE SUMMARY OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SHEETS
OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
THE APPEARANCES BEYOND ALL RATIONAL DOUBT OBSERVED IN THAT CASE ARE THE APPEARANCES OBSERVED IN MISTER KROOK'S CASE THE NEXT MOST FAMOUS
AND THERE IS A GENERAL SMELL AND TASTE AS OF THE ANCIENT DEDLOCKS IN THEIR GRAVES MY LADY DEDLOCK WHO IS CHILDLESS LOOKING OUT IN THE EARLY TWILIGHT FROM HER BOUDOIR
ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON SOME SCORE OF MEMBERS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY BAR OUGHT TO BE AS HERE THEY ARE MISTILY ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND STAGES OF AN ENDLESS CAUSE
WHEN ALL THE STOPPED SPITS IN THE KITCHEN SHALL BEGIN TO TURN PRODIGIOUSLY IT IS NOT A LARGE WORLD RELATIVELY EVEN TO THIS WORLD OF OURS WHICH HAS ITS LIMITS TOO
IN HIM INDEED HE MARRIED HER FOR LOVE A WHISPER STILL GOES ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN FAMILY
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IN LEGAL COURT SUITS THESE ARE ALL YAWNING FOR NO CRUMB OF AMUSEMENT EVER FALLS FROM JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE CAUSE IN HAND
AITS AND MEADOWS FOG DOWN THE RIVER WHERE IT ROLLS DEFILED AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING AND THE WATERSIDE POLLUTIONS OF A GREAT AND DIRTY CITY FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS
WHO SAID THAT SUCH A THING MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THE SKY RAINED POTATOES HE OBSERVED OR WHEN WE GET THROUGH JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE MISTER BLOWERS A PLEASANTRY THAT PARTICULARLY TICKLED THE MACES BAGS AND PURSES
FRENCH ENGLISH AND SCOTCH IN MORE MODERN DAYS CONTENTING MYSELF WITH OBSERVING THAT I SHALL NOT ABANDON THE FACTS UNTIL THERE SHALL HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF THE TESTIMONY ON WHICH HUMAN OCCURRENCES
I HAVE NO NEED TO OBSERVE THAT I DO NOT WILFULLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISLEAD MY READERS AND THAT BEFORE I WROTE THAT DESCRIPTION I TOOK PAINS TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT
OUGHT TO BE AS ARE THEY NOT RANGED IN A LINE IN A LONG MATTED WELL BUT YOU MIGHT LOOK IN VAIN FOR TRUTH AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
AND IT KNOWS ALL FASHIONABLE THINGS TO KNOW THINGS OTHERWISE WERE TO BE UNFASHIONABLE MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN DOWN AT WHAT SHE CALLS IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY NEVER CAN THERE COME FOG TOO THICK NEVER CAN THERE COME MUD AND MIRE TOO DEEP
TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND BOY THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE MISTER TANGLE CRUSHED WHOM I DIRECTED TO BE IN ATTENDANCE TO DAY AND WHO ARE NOW IN MY PRIVATE ROOM
HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE THE WATERS ARE OUT IN LINCOLNSHIRE AN ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IN THE PARK HAS BEEN SAPPED AND SOPPED AWAY THE ADJACENT LOW LYING GROUND
FOG CREEPING INTO THE CABOOSES OF COLLIER BRIGS FOG LYING OUT ON THE YARDS AND HOVERING IN THE RIGGING OF GREAT SHIPS FOG DROOPING ON THE GUNWALES OF BARGES AND SMALL BOATS
AND ALWAYS EXPECTING SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE JUDGMENT TO BE GIVEN IN HER FAVOUR
AND ARE COME TO THE BRINK OF THE VOID BEYOND IT IS A VERY LITTLE SPECK THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN IT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND TRUE PEOPLE IN IT IT HAS ITS APPOINTED PLACE BUT THE EVIL OF IT IS
THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
THE CHANCELLOR IS ABOUT TO BOW TO THE BAR WHEN THE PRISONER IS PRESENTED NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY COME OF THE PRISONER'S CONGLOMERATION BUT HIS BEING SENT BACK TO PRISON WHICH IS SOON DONE
DOWN IN HIS CLOSE CABIN FOG CRUELLY PINCHING THE TOES AND FINGERS OF HIS SHIVERING LITTLE PRENTICE BOY ON DECK
WHERE HER LADYSHIP INTENDS TO STAY SOME WEEKS AFTER WHICH HER MOVEMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE SAYS SO
MY LADY DEDLOCK'S PLACE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DREARY THE WEATHER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT HAS BEEN SO WET THAT THE TREES SEEM WET THROUGH
STILL ON JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE TO THE YOUNG GIRL BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON BOY SAYS MISTER TANGLE PREMATURELY
ITS HISTORY FROM THE OUTERMOST CIRCLE OF SUCH EVIL HAVE BEEN INSENSIBLY TEMPTED INTO A LOOSE WAY OF LETTING BAD THINGS ALONE TO TAKE THEIR OWN BAD COURSE AND A LOOSE BELIEF THAT IF THE WORLD GO WRONG
WHO ARE NEVER IN ANY CAUSE AND THE WELL OF SOLICITORS BEFORE MENTIONED THERE IS THE REGISTRAR BELOW THE JUDGE IN WIG AND GOWN AND THERE ARE TWO OR THREE MACES OR PETTY BAGS OR PRIVY PURSES
BY A LARGE ADVOCATE WITH GREAT WHISKERS A LITTLE VOICE AND AN INTERMINABLE BRIEF AND OUTWARDLY DIRECTING HIS CONTEMPLATION TO THE LANTERN IN THE ROOF WHERE HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT FOG
SMOKE LOWERING DOWN FROM CHIMNEY POTS MAKING A SOFT BLACK DRIZZLE WITH FLAKES OF SOOT IN IT AS BIG AS FULL GROWN SNOWFLAKES GONE INTO MOURNING ONE MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THE DEATH OF THE SUN
IT IS A DEADENED WORLD AND ITS GROWTH IS SOMETIMES UNHEALTHY FOR WANT OF AIR MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS RETURNED TO HER HOUSE IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS PREVIOUS TO HER DEPARTURE FOR PARIS
MY LORD BUT THE CHANCELLOR BEING AWARE OF HIM HAS DEXTEROUSLY VANISHED EVERYBODY ELSE QUICKLY VANISHES TOO
IS ALTERNATELY A LEAD COLOURED VIEW AND A VIEW IN INDIAN INK THE VASES ON THE STONE TERRACE IN THE FOREGROUND CATCH THE RAIN ALL DAY AND THE HEAVY DROPS FALL DRIP DRIP DRIP
INTO THE FREEZING MOOD AN EXHAUSTED COMPOSURE A WORN OUT PLACIDITY AN EQUANIMITY OF FATIGUE NOT TO BE RUFFLED BY INTEREST OR SATISFACTION ARE THE TROPHIES OF HER VICTORY
IS OMNISCIENT OF THE PAST AND PRESENT BUT NOT THE FUTURE CANNOT YET UNDERTAKE TO SAY SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK IS ONLY A BARONET
AND WERE CONSTANTLY BEING JUGGLED THROUGH THE WHOLE SET ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE PASSAGES AND THROUGH THE ROOMS WHICH ARE VERY BRILLIANT IN THE SEASON AND VERY DISMAL OUT OF IT
MAKE EIGHTEEN BOWS AND DROP INTO THEIR EIGHTEEN PLACES OF OBSCURITY WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE HEARING ON WEDNESDAY FORTNIGHT SAYS THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IS ONLY A QUESTION OF COSTS
ON BY NO MEANS ENLARGING THE NUMBER OF CHANCERY JUDGES APPOINTED I BELIEVE BY RICHARD THE SECOND BUT ANY OTHER KING WILL DO AS WELL THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO PROFOUND A JOKE TO BE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
SUFFER ANY WRONG THAT CAN BE DONE YOU RATHER THAN COME HERE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S COURT THIS MURKY AFTERNOON BESIDES THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE COUNSEL IN THE CAUSE TWO OR THREE COUNSEL
AND ITS SMOKE MOVES IN A TARDY LITTLE CLOUD TOWARDS THE GREEN RISE COPPICE TOPPED THAT MAKES A BACKGROUND FOR THE FALLING RAIN THE VIEW FROM MY LADY DEDLOCK'S OWN WINDOWS
DOGS UNDISTINGUISHABLE IN MIRE HORSES SCARCELY BETTER SPLASHED TO THEIR VERY BLINKERS FOOT PASSENGERS JOSTLING ONE ANOTHER'S UMBRELLAS IN A GENERAL INFECTION OF ILL TEMPER
HE IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY EVER TO DO IN THE MEANTIME HIS PROSPECTS IN LIFE ARE ENDED ANOTHER RUINED SUITOR WHO PERIODICALLY APPEARS FROM SHROPSHIRE AND BREAKS OUT INTO EFFORTS
IT IS BUT A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD OF FASHION
AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAS PASSED ALONG THE OLD ROOMS SHUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN THEY WILL NEXT COME FORTH AGAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH LIKE THE FIEND
UPON WHOSE IMPALING FILES REAMS OF DUSTY WARRANTS
DEMONS DEITIES MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES AND NAKED SAVAGES DISPORTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE MAPS AND HELPED TO DECORATE UNEXPLORED SPACES OF EARTH AND OCEAN
AND PLACES CONFIDENCE IN NOBODY BUT HIM ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD FAIL BESIDES BAZIN IS AMBITIOUS AND LEARNED BAZIN HAS READ HISTORY GENTLEMEN HE KNOWS THAT SIXTUS THE FIFTH BECAME POPE AFTER HAVING KEPT PIGS
LET US GIVE HIM ONLY HALF THE SUM PROMISED HIM WITH THE LETTER WITH AN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL HAVE THE OTHER HALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REPLY
IN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WHICH THE ILLUSTRIOUS MARINER HAD SOME SHARE IN TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM HE APPEARED AS A GODFATHER WHAT VOYAGES CARTIER ACTUALLY MADE BEFORE HE SUDDENLY APPEARS IN HISTORY AS A PILOT OF THE KING OF FRANCE
THE SON OF HIS SISTER JEHANNE STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST OF A GREAT MANY SACRED CEREMONIES OF THIS SORT IN WHICH HE TOOK PART THERE IS A RECORD OF MORE THAN FIFTY BAPTISMS AT SAINT MALO
YOU WILL FURTHER SAY TO HIM WATCH OVER HIS GRACE LORD BUCKINGHAM FOR THEY WISH TO ASSASSINATE HIM BUT THIS PLANCHET IS SO SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE NOT INFORMED MY FRIENDS THAT I WOULD ENTRUST THIS SECRET TO YOU AND FOR A CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION I WOULD NOT WRITE IT
WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER THE GREAT DISCOVERY OF COLUMBUS
HE CREDITED THIS WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO HIM THE EQUAL OF A DEMON WITH AGENTS AS SUPERNATURAL AS HERSELF AT THE LEAST NOISE HE IMAGINED HIMSELF ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED AND THAT PLANCHET WAS BEING BROUGHT BACK TO BE CONFRONTED WITH HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
THAT WILL REDUCE THE SUM TO FIVE THOUSAND LIVRES
WHOSE NAME IS ASSOCIATED FOR ALL TIME WITH THE PROUD TITLE OF DISCOVERER OF CANADA THE PICTURE IS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE STANDING ON THE DECK OF A SHIP HIS BENT ELBOW RESTING UPON THE GUNWALE
A BENEFIT REPROACHED IS AN OFFENSE COMMITTED THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE IF THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN UNDER YOUR CENSURE MY FAITH I RENOUNCE THE TASK AND YOU WILL DO RIGHT HANDLE THE MUSKET AND THE SWORD MY DEAR FELLOW
MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
AND THE PROTEGE OF THE HIGH ADMIRAL OF FRANCE WE DO NOT KNOW THIS POSITION IN ITSELF AND THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE IN FIFTEEN NINETEEN HE HAD ALREADY THE RANK OF MASTER PILOT
HAS PICTURED UPON IT A GROUP OF FIGURES THAT REPRESENT THE LANDING OF THE NAVIGATOR AND HIS FOLLOWERS AMONG THE INDIANS OF GASPE IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE TIME TO ATTEMPT BY SUCH DECORATIONS TO MAKE MAPS VIVID
HE THINKS IT HIS DUTY TO RESPOND TO THAT FRIENDSHIP BY SENDING YOU IMPORTANT INFORMATION TWICE YOU HAVE NEARLY BEEN THE VICTIM OF A NEAR RELATIVE WHOM YOU BELIEVE TO BE YOUR HEIR BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT THAT BEFORE SHE CONTRACTED A MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE
IF SHE IS AS GREAT A LADY AS HER WRITING IS LARGE YOU ARE A LUCKY FELLOW GOMRADE
ITS OWNER DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND IN DOING SO HE STUMBLED UPON A STARTLING DISCOVERY HE FOUND A DUMMY WINDOW THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILT OVER AND CONCEALED
AND OPENED THE SO ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED LETTER IT CONTAINED HALF A LINE IN A HAND PERFECTLY BRITISH AND WITH A CONCISENESS AS PERFECTLY SPARTAN THANK YOU BE EASY D'ARTAGNAN TRANSLATED THIS FOR THE OTHERS
D'ARTAGNAN HAS GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN AT ONCE THE DEVIL
IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO THERE HANGS A PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN OF THAT PLACE
NEFFER NEFFER
APPEAR ON THE REGISTERS OF SAINT MALO SAINT BRIAC AND OTHER PLACES IN SOME PROFUSION DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE FAMILY SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT ALTHOUGH NOT MANY YEARS AGO
IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WHO FELT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART A PARTIALITY FOR THE DUKE TOOK PLANCHET ASIDE
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT I AM TIRED OF FEARING WHEN I OPEN A FRESH BOTTLE THAT THE WINE MAY COME FROM THE CELLAR OF MILADY
AND SOUGHT SHELTER UPON THE SEA GIRT PROMONTORY WHICH HAS SINCE BORNE THE NAME OF AARON'S ROCK AARON FOUNDED A SETTLEMENT TO THE SAME PLACE CAME ABOUT TWENTY YEARS LATER
AND OF THEIR FIVE CHILDREN THE SECOND ONE JACQUES ROSE TO GREATNESS AS THE DISCOVERER OF CANADA THERE IS LITTLE TO CHRONICLE
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MONSIEUR ABBE HERE FOR EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS OR COMMON WANTS WILL THAT DO
MASTER PILOT OF THE PORT OF SAINCTE MALO
SAINT MALO BECAME FAMOUS AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORSAIRS OF THE NORTHERN COAST THESE HAD SUCCEEDED THE VIKINGS OF AN EARLIER DAY AND THEY SHOWED A HARDIHOOD AND A RECKLESS DARING EQUAL TO THAT OF THEIR PREDECESSORS LATER ON
A FAMILY AFFAIR WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL A FAMILY AFFAIR CONCERNED NOBODY PEOPLE MIGHT EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN A FAMILY AFFAIR BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
BUT THE THIRD TIME WHICH IS THE PRESENT YOU MAY SUCCUMB YOUR RELATIVE LEFT LA ROCHELLE FOR ENGLAND DURING THE NIGHT WATCH HER ARRIVAL FOR SHE HAS GREAT AND TERRIBLE PROJECTS IF YOU REQUIRE TO KNOW POSITIVELY WHAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF
THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
I HAVE DREAMED THAT THE UNLUCKY ENGLISHMAN WAS DEAD I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHETHER IT WAS BY STEEL OR BY POISON ONLY OF THIS I AM SURE I HAVE DREAMED HE WAS DEAD AND YOU KNOW MY DREAMS NEVER DECEIVE ME BE ASSURED THEN OF SEEING ME SOON RETURN
IF YOUR ARRANGEMENTS AT TOURS ARE YOUR ARRANGEMENTS ARAMIS THOSE OF LONDON ARE MINE I REQUEST THEN THAT PLANCHET MAY BE CHOSEN MORE PARTICULARLY AS HE HAS ALREADY BEEN TO LONDON WITH ME AND KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
WELL REPLIED THE LATTER BLUSHING WHAT MUST I SAY
YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
AND AS IF HE BREATHED HIS CUSTOMARY ATMOSPHERE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY IN PARTICULAR THESE SIGNS WERE SO STRONG IN D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT THEY COULD NOT REMAIN QUIET IN ONE PLACE AND WANDERED ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS ON THE ROAD BY WHICH PLANCHET WAS EXPECTED
BUT REMEMBER ALSO THAT IF BY YOUR FAULT ANY EVIL HAPPENS TO D'ARTAGNAN I WILL FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING UP YOUR BELLY
WE WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS FROM TERROR CREATED BY THE THREATS OR FROM TENDERNESS AT SEEING FOUR FRIENDS SO CLOSELY UNITED D'ARTAGNAN TOOK HIS HAND
NEFFER
A KIND OF MILLET AS BIG AS PEASON
AND THAT THIS ADVENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SAILING OF OTHER NORMAN SHIPS FOR THE SAME GOAL WE HAVE HOWEVER NO RECORD OF CARTIER AND HIS ACTUAL DOINGS UNTIL WE FIND HIS NAME IN AN ENTRY ON THE BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO
RAVAGED BY PERHAPS TWO CENTURIES OF WIND AND WEATHER THE OLD HOUSE AFFORDED BUT LITTLE SHELTER AGAINST THE BOISTEROUS GALES AND THE BITTER COLD OF THE RUDE CLIMATE OF THE GULF
HERE AGAIN ARE THE TUFTED HAT THE BEARDED FACE AND THE FEATURES OF THE PICTURE OF SAINT MALO ON THE BACK OF THE WOOD THE DEEPLY GRAVEN INITIALS J C SEEMED TO PROVE
MY LORD DO YOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE GOAT PASTURE OF THE LUXEMBOURG GOOD THE LUXEMBOURG ONE MIGHT BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALLUSION TO THE QUEEN MOTHER
AND IT IS A RATHER DIFFICULT MATTER THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF WOULD BE PUZZLED HOW TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER AND YET THE CHANCELLOR DRAWS UP AN OFFICIAL REPORT VERY READILY NEVER MIND BE SILENT I WILL WRITE
HERE FOR CENTURIES HAS DWELT A RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN AND NAVIGATORS WHOSE DARING IS UNSURPASSED BY ANY OTHER SEAFARING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HISTORY
IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PICTURE WHICH HANGS IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO IF IT DOES NOT SHOW US CARTIER AS HE WAS AND WE HAVE NO ABSOLUTE PROOF IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION
AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
WELL MY DEAR FRIEND ADD TO HIS NATURAL DEVOTEDNESS A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND THEN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING FOR HIM ONCE ANSWER FOR HIM TWICE
BUT SHE COULD NOT MARRY YOUR BROTHER BEING ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE AND HAVING BEEN
MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF I HAVE THE NOTE
PLANCHET IS BRAVE AND SHREWD THEY ARE TWO QUALITIES OUT OF THE FOUR GENTLEMEN SAID ARAMIS THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION IS NOT TO KNOW WHICH OF OUR FOUR LACKEYS IS THE MOST DISCREET THE MOST STRONG THE MOST CLEVER OR THE MOST BRAVE
ADORNED HIS HEAD WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT BUT AS WE HAVE SAID BAZIN HAD NOT BY HIS FORTUNATE RETURN REMOVED MORE THAN A PART OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS THE DAYS OF EXPECTATION ARE LONG
NOW SWORN TO THE SERVICE OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY
MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BAD SECRETARY WHERE YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED FOR SHAME THAT'S UNWORTHY A MAN OF SPIRIT IS NOT TO BE REMINDED OF SUCH SERVICES
AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
AND ROSE IN HIS TURN WITH A NERVOUS MOVEMENT HE COULD NOT REPRESS THE DAY HOWEVER PASSED AWAY AND THE EVENING CAME ON SLOWLY BUT FINALLY IT CAME THE BARS WERE FILLED WITH DRINKERS
IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
THIS JEAN CARTIER OR QUARTIER WHO WAS BORN IN SAINT MALO IN FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TOOK TO WIFE IN FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GUILLEMETTE BAUDOIN OF THE FOUR SONS THAT SHE BORE HIM
NOT AT ALL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS THE MATTER SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT VERY EASY IT WOULD BE NO DOUBT PARBLEU IF WE WRITE TO LORD DE WINTER ABOUT AFFAIRS OF VAST IMPORTANCE OF THE HORRORS OF THE CARDINAL
A PARTNER WORTHY OF HIS COMPANY THEY WERE PLAYING TOGETHER AS USUAL WHEN SEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED THE PATROL WAS HEARD PASSING TO DOUBLE THE POSTS AT HALF PAST SEVEN THE RETREAT WAS SOUNDED WE ARE LOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN THE EAR OF ATHOS
LIFE IS A CHAPLET OF LITTLE MISERIES WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER COUNTS WITH A SMILE BE PHILOSOPHERS AS I AM GENTLEMEN SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND LET US DRINK
SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES CRIED PORTHOS THAT POOR LITTLE DIAMOND WAS WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES
ARAMIS ACCORDINGLY TOOK THE QUILL REFLECTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WROTE EIGHT OR TEN LINES IN A CHARMING LITTLE FEMALE HAND AND THEN WITH A VOICE SOFT AND SLOW AS IF EACH WORD HAD BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY WEIGHED HE READ THE FOLLOWING MY LORD
VEGETABLE FIBRINE VEGETABLE ALBUMEN VEGETABLE CASEINE ANIMAL FLESH ANIMAL BLOOD AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION IN OUR FOOD ARE
IF WE NOW CALCULATE
FAT PECTINE STARCH BASSORINE GUM WINE CANE SUGAR BEER GRAPE SUGAR SPIRITS SUGAR OF MILK
WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE MOTHER AND EMPLOYED IN YIELDING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL THE YOUNG ANIMAL THEREFORE RECEIVES IN THE FORM OF CASEINE
MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS
NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL
EVEN MORE WIDELY EXTENDED THAN THE LION AND TIGER BECAUSE WHEN HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE KILLS WITHOUT EATING A NATION OF HUNTERS
BUT THIS THOU WILT SAY IS THE VERY POINT IN DISPUTE WHETHER ANY FOREKNOWING IS POSSIBLE OF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HERE THERE SEEMS TO THEE A CONTRADICTION AND IF THEY ARE FORESEEN THEIR NECESSITY FOLLOWS
GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL
THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
AND WOULD NECESSARILY YIELD TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN WERE NOT THE DEFICIENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF MASS OR GROWTH
WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED FROM FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN BY ITS GREAT SOLUBILITY AND BY NOT COAGULATING WHEN HEATED THE CHIEF CONSTITUENT OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD TO CONVERT CASEINE INTO BLOOD NO FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED AND IN THE CONVERSION OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD INTO CASEINE
MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS
BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
AND WHILE THE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANIMAL
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE PRODUCTS OF THE WASTE OR METAMORPHOSIS OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES
IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF GELATINE OR OF THOSE TISSUES WHICH CONTAIN IT THE GELATINOUS TISSUES THE GELATINE OF THE BONES THE MEMBRANES THE CELLS AND THE SKIN SUFFER IN THE ANIMAL BODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE
LET US ASSUME FOREKNOWLEDGE AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ITS INVOLVING ANY ACTUAL NECESSITY THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL I IMAGINE WILL REMAIN IN COMPLETE INTEGRITY BUT
CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL DIET IT IS THE CARBON OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF STARCH AND SUGAR
IN THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS BIRDS THE WANT OF ALL MOTION IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF DIMINISHED WASTE IN THE ORGANISED PARTS HENCE MILK IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THEM THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS IN THE CARNIVORA THUS PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER TWO DISTINCT FORMS
THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY
GRASPS EACH WHOLE THAT SENSE PRESENTS OR BREAKS INTO ELEMENTS SO DIVIDES AND RECOMBINES AND IN CHANGEFUL WISE NOW TO LOW DESCENDS AND NOW TO THE HEIGHT DOTH RISE
THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE
MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD
AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
FOREKNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE DEEMED ANY HINDRANCE TO THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL NOW SURELY THE SOLE GROUND ON WHICH THOU ARGUEST THE NECESSITY OF THE FUTURE IS THAT THINGS WHICH ARE FOREKNOWN CANNOT FAIL TO COME TO PASS BUT IF
IN THE ADULT STATE ARE PRODUCED IN QUANTITY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THE YOUNG ANIMAL RECEIVES THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD IN THE CASEINE OF THE MILK A METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANS GOES ON FOR BILE AND URINE ARE SECRETED
AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM BY SUBSTANCES DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN
AND SINCE THESE LAST ARE EXACTLY REPLACED BY THE FOOD TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE FOOD WERE THIS NOT THE CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN UNCHANGED
AND FOR THEIR GROWTH AND WHEN THE POWERS OF NUTRITION IN THE WHOLE BODY ARE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF THE HEALTH THEN
THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE VITAL PROCESS OF THE GRAMINIVORA BY THESE SUBSTANCES IS INDICATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING MANNER WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VERY SMALL RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CARBON
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE GRAMINIVORA WHOSE FOOD CONTAINS SO SMALL A PORTION RELATIVELY OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD THE PROCESS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN EXISTING TISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR RESTORATION OR REPRODUCTION
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
HYAENA IN THE CAGES OF A MENAGERIE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCELERATE THE WASTE OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES BY INCESSANT MOTION IN ORDER TO FURNISH THE MATTER NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION SO THE SAVAGE FOR THE VERY SAME OBJECT
LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD
THEIR EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON A SUPPLY OF SUBSTANCES HAVING A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF SUGAR OF MILK OR CLOSELY RESEMBLING IT EVERYTHING THAT THEY CONSUME AS FOOD CONTAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF STARCH GUM OR SUGAR MIXED WITH OTHER MATTERS
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT
WHILE ONLY THE BONE EARTH IS FOUND IN HIS EXCREMENTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF MAN WHEN FED ON FOOD RICH IN GELATINE AS FOR EXAMPLE STRONG SOUP THE GELATINE IS NOT TO BE FOUND EITHER IN THE URINE OR IN THE FAECES AND CONSEQUENTLY
THE MOST RECENT AND EXACT RESEARCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED AS A UNIVERSAL FACT TO WHICH NOTHING YET KNOWN IS OPPOSED THAT THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLE FOOD
LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD
WHICH THEIR ORGANISM CANNOT EMPLOY FOR NUTRITION STRICTLY SO CALLED THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH IN THEIR NOURISHMENT IN THE ADULT STATE
THAT THE TISSUES YIELDING GELATINE OR CHONDRINE AS FOR EXAMPLE THE GELATINE OF SKIN OR OF BONES ARE NOT ADAPTED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE VITAL PROCESS FOR THEIR COMPOSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN
WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE
SUGAR OF MILK HAS A COMPOSITION CLOSELY ALLIED TO THAT OF THE OTHER KINDS OF SUGAR OF STARCH AND OF GUM ALL OF THEM CONTAIN CARBON AND THE ELEMENTS OF WATER THE LATTER PRECISELY IN THE PROPORTION TO FORM WATER
AND PRODUCES IN THE ORGANISM THE HEAT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE OUR BLOOD FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODY ARE DEVELOPED MAN
OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH
NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT
THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR
THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
WHEREAS THE CASE IS THE VERY REVERSE ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS GRASPED NOT CONFORMABLY TO ITS OWN EFFICACY BUT RATHER CONFORMABLY TO THE FACULTY OF THE KNOWER
OUR LAMPES BURNING BOTHE NIGHT AND DAY TO BRING ABOUT OUR CRAFT IF THAT WE MAY OUR FURNACE EKE OF CALCINATION AND OF WATERS ALBIFICATION
THEN WERE WE SICKER ENOW
AND THIS WAS HIS DEMAND IN SOOTHFASTNESS
THESE PHILOSOPHERS SPEAK SO MISTILY IN THIS CRAFT THAT MEN CANNOT COME THEREBY FOR ANY WIT THAT MEN HAVE HOW A DAYS THEY MAY WELL CHATTER AS DO THESE JAYS
WHERE THAT HE IS LORD AND SIRE IS THERE NO MORE WOE RANCOUR NOR IRE WHEN THAT OUR POT IS BROKE AS I HAVE SAID
TRUSTE ME WELL IN HIS PROSPERITY
TO SEEK IN ARMES WORSHIP AND HONOUR FOR ALL HIS LUST
HE TOOK THE CHALK AND SHAP'D IT IN THE WISE OF AN INGOT
YE BE RIGHT HOT I SEE WELL HOW YE SWEAT HAVE HERE A CLOTH AND WIPE AWAY THE WET
AND THUS SAID IN HIS GAME STOOP NOW ADOWN BY GOD YE BE TO BLAME
SHOULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF NO MASTERY
THAT I HAVE BORROW'D TRUELY THAT WHILE I LIVE
AND DIVERS FIRES MADE OF WOOD AND COAL
AND FOR NONE OTHER CAUSE TRUELY
THIS IS MY CONCLUSION TO CLERKS LEAVE I ALL DISPUTATION BUT WOULD TO GOD THAT ALL THESE ROCKES BLAKE WERE SUNKEN INTO HELLE FOR HIS SAKE
LO THUS BY SMELLING AND THREADBARE ARRAY IF THAT MEN LIST THIS FOLK THEY KNOWE MAY AND IF A MAN WILL ASK THEM PRIVILY

AND MADE THE PRIEST TO BLOW AND IN HIS WORKING FOR TO STOOPE LOW AS HE DID ERST
AS FARFORTH
AS MINISTER OF MY WIT THE DOUBLENESS OF THIS CANON ROOT OF ALL CURSEDNESS HE FRIENDLY SEEM'D TO THEM THAT KNEW HIM NOT BUT HE WAS FIENDLY BOTH IN WORK AND THOUGHT IT WEARIETH ME TO TELL OF HIS FALSENESS

THINGES THAT RIGOUR NEVER SHOULD ATTAIN FOR EVERY WORD MEN MAY NOT CHIDE OR PLAIN
THUS WOULD SHE SAY WITH MANY A PITEOUS TEAR
RIGHT WELL I KNOW IN MY VISAGE FOR FUMES DIVERSE OF METALS WHICH YE HAVE ME HEARD REHEARSE CONSUMED HAVE AND WASTED MY REDNESS

THESE JUDGES AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO YOU AND VERY RECOGNISANT OF YOUR SERVICES ARE THEY NOT NOTHING CONNECTED WITH CHARLES WAS CONCEALED FROM ME I HAD THE STRONGEST ASSURANCES THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND I DID
GOT INTO IT AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE THE DRIVER WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE GATEWAY WHERE HE HAD PAUSED IN THE DARK NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF ON WHICH OF THE ROUGH STONES OF THE STREET HER FEET HAD TRODDEN HE LIFTED HER AGAIN
YES RETURNED MISTER LORRY DRYING HIS EYES YOU ARE RIGHT BUT HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE YES HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE ECHOED CARTON
AND PEACH KERNELS POUR BOILING WATER ON THEM WHICH WILL MAKE THEM PEEL EASILY EITHER ROLL THEM WITH A BOTTLE ON THE CAKE BOARD OR POUND IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOAF SUGAR THEY SHOULD NOT BE POUNDED TOO MUCH OR THEY WILL BE OILY
ALONG WITH TWO OF THE FOUR MEN WHO HAD TAKEN HIM LAST NIGHT AND BARSAD THE PEOPLE HAD ALL POURED OUT TO THE SHOW IN THE STREETS BARSAD PROPOSED TO THE REST LET HER EMBRACE HIM THEN IT IS BUT A MOMENT
AND HAD ONLY LEFT HER FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COME AND KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT HER FATHER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE QUITTED THE BANKING HOUSE TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK SHE HAD SOME FAINT HOPES THAT HIS MEDIATION MIGHT SAVE CHARLES BUT THEY WERE VERY SLIGHT
STRAIN IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND SKIM OFF ALL THE FAT THAT IS ON THE TOP SET IT AWAY TO COOL AND WHEN THE JELLY IS QUITE STIFF WIPE IT WITH A TOWEL TO TAKE OFF ANY GREASE THAT SHOULD REMAIN
HE BENT OVER THE CHILD AND LAID HER BLOOMING CHEEK AGAINST HIS FACE HE PUT HER GENTLY FROM HIM AND LOOKED AT HER UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER BEFORE I GO HE SAID AND PAUSED I MAY KISS HER
SYDNEY CARTON PAUSED IN THE STREET NOT QUITE DECIDED WHERE TO GO AT TELLSON'S BANKING HOUSE AT NINE HE SAID WITH A MUSING FACE SHALL I DO WELL IN THE MEAN TIME TO SHOW MYSELF I THINK SO
WHERE IS MY BENCH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR MY BENCH AND I CAN'T FIND IT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH MY WORK TIME PRESSES I MUST FINISH THOSE SHOES THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR HEARTS DIED WITHIN THEM COME
YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
FOR THE SAKE OF HER CHILD AND HER FATHER PRESS UPON HER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING PARIS WITH THEM AND YOU AT THAT HOUR TELL HER THAT IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S LAST ARRANGEMENT
AND THEN ADVANCED TO HIM HERSELF AND ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS HE HAD ORDERED HE REPEATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID ENGLISH ASKED MADAME DEFARGE INQUISITIVELY RAISING HER DARK EYEBROWS
THEY SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE AS THEY WOULD HAVE USED IF THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING BY A SICK BED IN THE NIGHT CARTON STOOPED TO PICK UP THE COAT WHICH LAY ALMOST ENTANGLING HIS FEET
DID I SAY WE COULD DEPEND UPON NO BETTER MAN TELL HER TO NIGHT WHAT YOU KNOW OF HER DANGER AS INVOLVING HER CHILD AND HER FATHER DWELL UPON THAT FOR SHE WOULD LAY HER OWN FAIR HEAD BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S CHEERFULLY
WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
IT WILL BE DARK SOON AFTER FOUR LET US STRETCH THE HOUR OR TWO IF I GO TO MISTER LORRY'S AT NINE SHALL I HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE EITHER FROM OUR FRIEND OR FROM YOURSELF YES MAY YOU PROSPER MISTER LORRY
HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS
AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
WHEN EGGS ARE USED IN CALF'S FOOT AND OTHER JELLIES CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE INGREDIENTS COOL
IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER FACE WITH HIS LIPS HE MURMURED SOME WORDS THE CHILD WHO WAS NEAREST TO HIM TOLD THEM AFTERWARDS AND TOLD HER GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SHE WAS A HANDSOME OLD LADY THAT SHE HEARD HIM SAY A LIFE YOU LOVE
AND STRAIN IT TO A PINT OF THIS JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL IT TILL IT IS A RICH SYRUP AND KEEP IT CORKED UP IN BOTTLES TO SEASON ICE CREAM ALMOND CREAM TAKE A POUND OF BLANCHED ALMONDS AND ROLL THEM FINE WITH A BOTTLE
TO EACH PINT OF JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL THEM TOGETHER TILL IT BECOMES A JELLY WHEN COLD PUT IT IN A JAR AND TIE IT CLOSE USE A SMALL QUANTITY OF THIS TO STAIN ICE CREAM OR JELLY
THE WRETCHED WIFE OF THE INNOCENT MAN THUS DOOMED TO DIE FELL UNDER THE SENTENCE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MORTALLY STRICKEN BUT SHE UTTERED NO SOUND AND SO STRONG WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HER REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS SHE OF ALL THE WORLD WHO MUST UPHOLD HIM IN HIS MISERY
ICE CREAM WITH FRUIT MIX THE JUICE OF THE FRUIT WITH AS MUCH SUGAR AS WILL BE WANTED BEFORE YOU ADD THE CREAM WHICH NEED NOT BE VERY RICH POKEBERRY JUICE TO STAIN ICES MASH AND STRAIN RIPE POKEBERRIES
A MOMENT LET ME SPEAK OF IT IN ITS PLACE FIRST HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS COAT AND TOOK ANOTHER PAPER FROM IT THAT IS THE CERTIFICATE WHICH ENABLES ME TO PASS OUT OF THIS CITY LOOK AT IT YOU SEE SYDNEY CARTON AN ENGLISHMAN
EARLY TO MORROW HAVE YOUR HORSES READY SO THAT THEY MAY BE IN STARTING TRIM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT SHALL BE DONE HIS MANNER WAS SO FERVENT AND INSPIRING THAT MISTER LORRY CAUGHT THE FLAME AND WAS AS QUICK AS YOUTH YOU ARE A NOBLE HEART
DEFARGE WENT BACK TO THE COUNTER AND SAID CERTAINLY A LITTLE LIKE MADAME STERNLY RETORTED I TELL YOU A GOOD DEAL LIKE JACQUES THREE PACIFICALLY REMARKED
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
WHILE SHE ONLY FAINTS OH CARTON CARTON DEAR CARTON CRIED LITTLE LUCIE SPRINGING UP AND THROWING HER ARMS PASSIONATELY ROUND HIM IN A BURST OF GRIEF NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME I THINK YOU WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP MAMMA
AND SLIGHTLY ALTERED THE DISORDERED ARRANGEMENT OF HIS LOOSE CRAVAT AND HIS COAT COLLAR AND HIS WILD HAIR THIS DONE HE WENT ON DIRECT TO DEFARGE'S AND WENT IN THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO CUSTOMER IN THE SHOP BUT JACQUES THREE
AS THAT BASTILLE PAPER DESCRIBES IS MY FAMILY DEFARGE THAT SISTER OF THE MORTALLY WOUNDED BOY UPON THE GROUND WAS MY SISTER THAT HUSBAND WAS MY SISTER'S HUSBAND THAT UNBORN CHILD WAS THEIR CHILD
WHEN THE CREAM IS PUT IN A MOULD CLOSE IT AND MOVE IT IN THE ICE AS YOU CANNOT USE A SPOON WITHOUT WASTE ICE CREAM WITH LEMON ROLL TWO FRESH LEMONS IN AS MUCH POWDERED LOAF SUGAR AS WILL SWEETEN A QUART OF CREAM
PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
DON'T SUFFER FOR ME A PARTING BLESSING FOR OUR CHILD I SEND IT TO HER BY YOU I KISS HER BY YOU I SAY FAREWELL TO HER BY YOU MY HUSBAND NO A MOMENT HE WAS TEARING HIMSELF APART FROM HER
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
LET ME GET TO WORK GIVE ME MY WORK RECEIVING NO ANSWER HE TORE HIS HAIR AND BEAT HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND LIKE A DISTRACTED CHILD DON'T TORTURE A POOR FORLORN WRETCH HE IMPLORED THEM WITH A DREADFUL CRY BUT GIVE ME MY WORK
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
THE MOMENT I COME TO YOU TAKE ME IN AND DRIVE AWAY I UNDERSTAND THAT I WAIT FOR YOU UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU HAVE MY CERTIFICATE IN YOUR HAND WITH THE REST YOU KNOW AND WILL RESERVE MY PLACE WAIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO HAVE MY PLACE OCCUPIED
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU SPEED THOUGH MIND I EXPECT NOTHING WHEN ARE YOU LIKELY TO HAVE SEEN THESE DREAD POWERS DOCTOR MANETTE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DARK I SHOULD HOPE WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO FROM THIS
THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
AND CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRCASE TO THEIR ROOMS THERE HE LAID HER DOWN ON A COUCH WHERE HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS WEPT OVER HER DON'T RECALL HER TO HERSELF HE SAID SOFTLY TO THE LATTER SHE IS BETTER SO DON'T REVIVE HER TO CONSCIOUSNESS
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
CONSOLATORY TO HER
IT WAS SILENTLY ACQUIESCED IN AND THEY PASSED HER OVER THE SEATS IN THE HALL TO A RAISED PLACE WHERE HE BY LEANING OVER THE DOCK COULD FOLD HER IN HIS ARMS FAREWELL DEAR DARLING OF MY SOUL
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
MY PARTING BLESSING ON MY LOVE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN WHERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST THEY WERE HER HUSBAND'S WORDS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS BOSOM I CAN BEAR IT DEAR CHARLES I AM SUPPORTED FROM ABOVE
SEASON IT WITH A FEW DROPS OF ESSENCE OF LEMON OR SYRUP OF LEMON PEEL AND POWDERED WHITE SUGAR AND IF YOU CHOOSE A SPOONFUL OF PRESERVE SYRUP AND JUST AS YOU SEND IT TO TABLE
FOR OTHER CRIMES AS TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS I HAVE THIS RACE A LONG TIME ON MY REGISTER DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION AND EXTERMINATION ASK MY HUSBAND IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE WITHOUT BEING ASKED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DAYS
HE RETURNED THE ANSWER IN GREAT TROUBLE AND VERY SLOWLY TRY THEM AGAIN THE HOURS BETWEEN THIS AND TO MORROW AFTERNOON ARE FEW AND SHORT BUT TRY I INTEND TO TRY I WILL NOT REST A MOMENT
AND THEN FOR ENGLAND WHY THEN SAID MISTER LORRY GRASPING HIS EAGER BUT SO FIRM AND STEADY HAND IT DOES NOT ALL DEPEND ON ONE OLD MAN BUT I SHALL HAVE A YOUNG AND ARDENT MAN AT MY SIDE BY THE HELP OF HEAVEN YOU SHALL
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
AND I DID IT A BLIND MAN AND I'M TO LOSE MY CHANCE FOR YOU I'M TO BE A POOR CRAWLING BEGGAR SPONGING FOR RUM WHEN I MIGHT BE ROLLING IN A COACH
I CAME BY A HOUSE WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND GOT A ROUGH DIRECTION FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CRAMOND AND SO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WORKED MY WAY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE CAPITAL BY COLINTON TILL I CAME OUT UPON THE GLASGOW ROAD AND THERE TO MY GREAT PLEASURE AND WONDER
THEY RESTED AWHILE AND THEN TOOK ANOTHER WHICH FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY CALLED DINNER AFTER DINNER THE BOYS SAT WARMING THEMSELVES AT THE INN ALL BUT PETER WHO OCCUPIED THE TIME IN ANOTHER FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR DOCTOR BOEKMAN
SAID I FOR I WAS GROWING VERY WROTH WELL
IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO GET IT PUT IN SAFETY TO BE SURE BOY QUITE RIGHT SAID HE I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I THOUGHT PERHAPS DOCTOR LIVESEY I BEGAN PERFECTLY RIGHT
STONE DEAD AS FOR MY MOTHER WHEN WE HAD CARRIED HER UP TO THE HAMLET A LITTLE COLD WATER AND SALTS AND THAT SOON BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN AND SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR HER TERROR
SAID A VOICE I HAVE COME HERE WITH A LETTER I SAID TO MISTER EBENEZER BALFOUR OF SHAWS IS HE HERE FROM WHOM IS IT ASKED THE MAN WITH THE BLUNDERBUSS THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
SAID BEN AFTER LAMBERT HAD BEEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ODDITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE SUBURBS IT IS ALL WINDMILLS YOU REMEMBER HIS TERRIFIC CONTEST WITH ONE I SUPPOSE NO SAID LAMBERT BLUNTLY
SO IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN TO THE HOLE THE LUGGER WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY THOUGH STILL CLOSE IN HE HAILED HER A VOICE REPLIED TELLING HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT OR HE WOULD GET SOME LEAD IN HIM
AT THIS PEW SAW HIS ERROR TURNED WITH A SCREAM AND RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE DITCH INTO WHICH HE ROLLED BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN IN A SECOND AND MADE ANOTHER DASH NOW UTTERLY BEWILDERED RIGHT UNDER THE NEAREST OF THE COMING HORSES
BEN AND LAMBERT HAD OFTEN VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SURPRISED AT THE RICHNESS OF THE LEYDEN COLLECTION THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS WEARING APPAREL WEAPONS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
AND WITH A CURIOUS CHANGE OF VOICE THAT THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED
AND POINTED TO A GREAT BULK OF BUILDING STANDING VERY BARE UPON A GREEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT VALLEY THE COUNTRY WAS PLEASANT ROUND ABOUT RUNNING IN LOW HILLS PLEASANTLY WATERED AND WOODED AND THE CROPS TO MY EYES WONDERFULLY GOOD
NO ROAD LED UP TO IT NO SMOKE AROSE FROM ANY OF THE CHIMNEYS NOR WAS THERE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A GARDEN MY HEART SANK THAT I CRIED THE WOMAN'S FACE LIT UP WITH A MALIGNANT ANGER
BUT THE BOYS SPENT A FEW PLEASANT MOMENTS IN THE STADHUIS OR TOWN HALL A LONG IRREGULAR STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT IN THE GOTHIC STYLE UNCOUTH IN ARCHITECTURE BUT PICTURESQUE FROM AGE ITS LITTLE STEEPLE TUNEFUL WITH BELLS
AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
AND SHE WHEN I HAD PUT MY USUAL QUESTION TURNED SHARP ABOUT
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
ONE TAILING OUT BEHIND THE REST WAS A LAD THAT HAD GONE FROM THE HAMLET TO DOCTOR LIVESEY'S THE REST WERE REVENUE OFFICERS WHOM HE HAD MET BY THE WAY AND WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO RETURN AT ONCE
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
SQUALLING WAS THE WORD FOR IT PEW'S ANGER ROSE SO HIGH AT THESE OBJECTIONS TILL AT LAST HIS PASSION COMPLETELY TAKING THE UPPER HAND HE STRUCK AT THEM RIGHT AND LEFT IN HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS STICK SOUNDED HEAVILY ON MORE THAN ONE
COMING TO THE TOP OF A HILL I SAW ALL THE COUNTRY FALL AWAY BEFORE ME DOWN TO THE SEA AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DESCENT ON A LONG RIDGE
BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
THE CITY IS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS WATER ROADS FORMED BY THE RIVER RHINE THERE GROWN SLUGGISH FATIGUED BY ITS LONG TRAVEL BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STONE BRIDGES REUNITE THE DISSEVERED STREETS
IN THOSE DAYS FOLK STILL BELIEVED IN WITCHES AND TREMBLED AT A CURSE AND THIS ONE FALLING SO PAT LIKE A WAYSIDE OMEN TO ARREST ME ERE I CARRIED OUT MY PURPOSE TOOK THE PITH OUT OF MY LEGS
BUT A TRAGEDY CAME IN SPITE OF HIM POOT WAS BENDING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH WALL IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM TO GROW DIZZY AND TUMBLE OFF BEN TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY IF THE FELLOW WITH HIS WEAK HEAD
SIMPLEX SIGILLUM VERI THEY ALSO OBTAINED ADMITTANCE TO A TEA GARDEN WHICH IN SUMMER WAS A FAVORITE RESORT OF THE CITIZENS AND PASSING NAKED OAKS AND FRUIT TREES
BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED
I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IN HIS ADVENTURES AND IF THERE WASN'T THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOK AT THEM HOW FRANTICALLY THEY WHIRL THEIR GREAT ARMS JUST THE THING TO EXCITE THE CRAZY KNIGHT TO MORTAL COMBAT
PETER AND JACOB REGARDED THE BUILDING WITH AN EVEN DEEPER MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR THEY WERE TO ENTER IT AS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS POOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD HAVE RUN A HOPELESS TILT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
ASCENDED TO A HIGH MOUND WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTER THIS WAS THE SITE OF A ROUND TOWER NOW IN RUINS SAID BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY HENGIST THE ANGLO SAXON KING
PEW HE CRIED THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE US SOMEONE'S TURNED THE CHEST OUT ALOW AND ALOFT IS IT THERE ROARED PEW THE MONEY'S THERE THE BLIND MAN CURSED THE MONEY
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER BUILDING AND HASTILY CLAPPED ON AS A FINISHING TOUCH
AT THAT ANOTHER FELLOW PROBABLY HIM WHO HAD REMAINED BELOW TO SEARCH THE CAPTAIN'S BODY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE INN
HE STOPPED HIS CART AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE OTHERS AY SAID HE WHAT FOR IT'S A GREAT HOUSE I ASKED DOUBTLESS SAYS HE
CRIES THE CARTER IN SO SHARP A NOTE THAT HIS VERY HORSE STARTED AND THEN WELL MANNIE HE ADDED IT'S NANE OF MY AFFAIRS BUT YE SEEM A DECENT SPOKEN LAD AND IF YE'LL TAKE A WORD FROM ME YE'LL KEEP CLEAR OF THE SHAWS
AND ANOTHER READY TO FAINT BEN MANAGED TO TURN HIS HEAD HE SAW A CROWD OF BOYS ON THE EDGE OF THE WALL OPPOSITE BUT JACOB WAS NOT THERE GOOD HEAVENS HE CRIED SPRINGING FORWARD WHERE IS MY COUSIN
I WAS IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RUN AWAY BUT ANGER GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I BEGAN INSTEAD TO RAIN KICKS AND BUFFETS ON THE DOOR
INTERESTED THEM FOR A WHILE AND BEN HAD TO BE ALMOST PULLED AWAY FROM THE DINGY OLD PORTRAIT OF VAN DER WERF THE TOWN HALL AS WELL AS THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IS ON THE BREEDSTRAAT THE LONGEST AND FINEST STREET IN LEYDEN
HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
THE PRIDE OF LIFE SEEMED TO MOUNT INTO MY BRAIN AT THE SIGHT OF THE RED COATS AND THE HEARING OF THAT MERRY MUSIC A LITTLE FARTHER ON
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
WHY JOSEPH CAN IT BE YOU YES MA'AM YES MISS ANSWERED HE AGAIN TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH ALL THE RESPECT HE COULD POSSIBLY PUT INTO THE ACTION IT'S A LUCKY DAY WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE UPON IT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SAID MISSUS COLEMAN
FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER
NOTHING ELSE OF MOMENT MARKED THE REMAINDER OF THE RIVER JOURNEY AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY THE CANOES PULLED TO SHORE AND A NIGHT CAMP WAS MADE BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES WE ARE TO USE IN TRAVELING TO MORROW ASKED THE PROFESSOR OF JACINTO IN THE NEXT VILLAGE
HE GOT HOLD OF THE BROOM AT HER END AND PULLED ALONG WITH HER BUT THE BOYS PROCEEDED TO ROUGHER MEASURES
AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
ONE DAY JACK GAVE HIM A CURRY COMB AND A BRUSH TO TRY HIS HAND UPON OLD DIAMOND'S COAT HE USED THEM SO DEFTLY SO GENTLY AND YET SO THOROUGHLY AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH THAT THE MAN COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIM YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND GROW HE SAID
AND THEN MISSUS COLEMAN TOOK OUT HER PURSE SAYING AND WHAT'S YOUR FARE JOSEPH NO THANK YOU MA'AM SAID JOSEPH IT WAS YOUR OWN OLD HORSE AS TOOK YOU AND ME YOU PAID LONG AGO HE JUMPED ON HIS BOX BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS
WHY IS THAT WHY PERSISTED DIAMOND
FROM WITHOUT THE TENT CAME THE INDIAN CRIES OF OSHTOO OSHTOO MINGLED WITH THEM WERE CALLS OF JACINTO PARTLY IN SPANISH PARTLY IN THE INDIAN TONGUE AND PARTLY IN ENGLISH IT IS A RAID BY VAMPIRE BATS WAS ALL TOM AND NED COULD DISTINGUISH
AND GIVE ANOTHER TO THE OLD WATERMAN HE LEFT DIAMOND ON THE BOX A SUDDEN NOISE GOT UP AND DIAMOND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES A LARGE WILD APPLE TREE BENT OVER IT
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
I'M AFRAID HE WAS RATHER A FALSE FRIEND WAS THE PROFESSOR'S ANSWER
BUT MAYHAP THEY MAY GET MORE LAW THAN THEY LIKE SOME DAY THEMSELVES
AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS BEING IN A FRAY I COULDN'T LET THEM BEHAVE SO TO A POOR GIRL COULD I FATHER HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT DIAMOND SAID HIS FATHER QUITE PLEASED FOR DIAMOND'S FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN
ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
CAN KILL A HORSE OR AN OX IN A SHORT TIME BY SUCKING ITS BLOOD SO WHEN THE VILLAGERS FIND THEY ARE VISITED BY A COLONY OF THESE VAMPIRES THEY GET OUT TAKING THEIR LIVE STOCK WITH THEM AND STAY IN CAVES OR IN DENSELY WOODED PLACES UNTIL THE BATS FLY ON
WHEN THEY FOUND THE WAY BLOCKED UP AND UPON INQUIRY WERE INFORMED THAT A STACK OF CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN IN THE NIGHT
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS
APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CURBSTONE WHO SHOULD IT BE WAITING FOR THE CAB BUT MISSUS AND MISS COLEMAN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE CABMAN HOWEVER
FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
AND THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY GOT ANY FARTHER WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIM NICELY HE HAD ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER SOMETIMES A SMART ONE READY AND THAT HELPED MUCH TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HIM
THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE
PROFESSOR BUMPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE MAN'S FAMILY DID NOT WANT AND THIS SEEMED TO GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY TO A BROTHER WHO WAS WITH THE PARTY ASIDE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN A DRENCHING STORM AND ONE OR TWO MINOR ACCIDENTS
HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND BECAME A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH ALL THE MEN ABOUT THE MEWS SOME MAY THINK IT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT UP IN BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THERE HE WAS
THOUGH TO BE SURE SAID DIAMOND'S FATHER WITH WHAT TRUTH I CANNOT SAY BUT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID SOME LADIES IS VERY HARD AND KEEPS YOU TO THE BARE SIXPENCE A MILE WHEN EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP A FAMILY AND A CAB UPON TO BE SURE IT'S THE LAW
NOBODY KNOWS THE SENSE IN THAT HEAD OF HIS THE TWO LADIES WENT NEAR TO PAT THE HORSE AND THEN THEY NOTICED DIAMOND ON THE BOX WHY YOU'VE GOT BOTH DIAMONDS WITH YOU SAID MISS COLEMAN HOW DO YOU DO DIAMOND DIAMOND LIFTED HIS CAP AND ANSWERED POLITELY
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
FINALLY THE SCIENTIST SAID OH YES WE MAY FIND AN IDOL I UNDERSTAND THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE SPANIARDS CAME WORSHIPED IDOLS BUT WE SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ANTIQUITIES WE FIND HUH GRUNTED JACINTO
WE MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT NED WE WERE TO START BEFORE OLD SOL GOT IN HIS HEAVY WORK BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ONE CALL US REMARKED NED NOR I WONDER IF WE'RE THE ONLY LAZY BIRDS
SAW A WEIRD SIGHT CIRCLING AND WHEELING ABOUT IN THE CAMP CLEARING WERE MANY OF THE BLACK SHADOWY FORMS THAT HAD CAUSED NED SUCH ALARM GREAT BATS THEY WERE AND A DANGEROUS SPECIES IF JACINTO WAS TO BE BELIEVED
SAID HIS MOTHER SHE HAD RINGS ON HER FINGERS ANYHOW RETURNED DIAMOND OF COURSE SHE HAD AS ANY LADY WOULD WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT WHEN WE WERE DOWN AT SANDWICH SAID DIAMOND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO PART WITH YOUR MOTHER'S RING NOW WE WERE POOR
FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST
THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
COME BACK AGAIN CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SKIN I HOPE NOT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BATS AND MOSQUITOES HE ADDED AS HE SLAPPED AT HIS FACE AND NECK INDEED THE PARTY OF WHITES WERE SET UPON BY THE NIGHT INSECTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
THEY DREW UP IN THE ROW UPON THE STAND BETWEEN COCKSPUR STREET AND PALL MALL THEY WAITED A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT TO BE CARRIED ANYWHERE BY AND BY LADIES WOULD BE GOING HOME FROM THE ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF A JOB
SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
I CERTAINLY AM IF THERE'S A FIGHT
AND ALSO TO HAVE A LITTLE CANVASBACK SHOOTING AT TREVENNA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN PAUSED AGAIN AND CONTINUED WITH INCREASING BENEVOLENCE BEFORE TAKING HIM DOWN TO MARYLAND WE ARE INVITING A FEW FRIENDS TO MEET HIM HERE ONLY A LITTLE DINNER
OLD FASHIONED EYES I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN MINE MY DEAR I LIKE ALL THE NOVELTIES SAID THE ANCESTRESS LIFTING THE STONE TO HER SMALL BRIGHT ORBS WHICH NO GLASSES HAD EVER DISFIGURED
VERY HANDSOME SHE ADDED RETURNING THE JEWEL VERY LIBERAL IN MY TIME A CAMEO SET IN PEARLS WAS THOUGHT SUFFICIENT BUT IT'S THE HAND THAT SETS OFF THE RING ISN'T IT MY DEAR MISTER ARCHER
THAN WHEN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN PAINTED SHE ALWAYS INDEED STRUCK NEWLAND ARCHER AS HAVING BEEN RATHER GRUESOMELY PRESERVED IN THE AIRLESS ATMOSPHERE OF A PERFECTLY IRREPROACHABLE EXISTENCE AS BODIES CAUGHT IN GLACIERS
WAS ALWAYS AN AMUSING EPISODE TO THE YOUNG MAN THE HOUSE IN ITSELF WAS ALREADY AN HISTORIC DOCUMENT THOUGH NOT OF COURSE AS VENERABLE AS CERTAIN OTHER OLD FAMILY HOUSES IN UNIVERSITY PLACE AND LOWER FIFTH AVENUE
AND SO SHE HAD DECIDED TO TRY WASHINGTON WHERE ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET MORE VARIETIES OF PEOPLE AND OF OPINION AND ON THE WHOLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY SETTLE DOWN IN WASHINGTON AND MAKE A HOME THERE FOR POOR MEDORA
COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
OF COURSE I KNOW YES AND I'M SO GLAD BUT ONE DOESN'T TELL SUCH THINGS FIRST IN A CROWD THE LADIES WERE ON THE THRESHOLD AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE COME AND SEE ME SOME DAY SHE SAID STILL LOOKING AT ARCHER
AT LENGTH SHE SAID I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CONFESSION MORE DISPASSIONATELY
YET SO CHAINED TO THEIR SEPARATE DESTINIES THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN HALF THE WORLD APART
EVER SEPARATED THEMSELVES ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING AS CONTROVERSIAL AS A TALKING OVER BUT AS NEITHER HAD EVER REACHED A DECISION WITHOUT PREFACING IT BY THIS MYSTERIOUS CONCLAVE MISSUS ARCHER AND HER SON
FACED THAT OF HER LOVELY ANCESTRESS IT WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS FINE AS A CABANEL AND THOUGH TWENTY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE ITS EXECUTION WAS STILL A PERFECT LIKENESS INDEED
THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING ELSE AND IN SPITE OF THE COSMOPOLITAN VIEWS ON WHICH HE PRIDED HIMSELF HE THANKED HEAVEN THAT HE WAS A NEW YORKER
THEY LUNCHED SLOWLY AND MEDITATIVELY WITH MUTE INTERVALS BETWEEN RUSHES OF TALK FOR THE SPELL ONCE BROKEN THEY HAD MUCH TO SAY AND YET MOMENTS WHEN SAYING BECAME THE MERE ACCOMPANIMENT
BEING LONG FORESEEN BY WATCHFUL RELATIVES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PASSED UPON IN FAMILY COUNCIL AND THE ENGAGEMENT RING A LARGE THICK SAPPHIRE SET IN INVISIBLE CLAWS MET WITH HER UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
WHICH RECALLED SCENES IN FRENCH FICTION AND ARCHITECTURAL INCENTIVES TO IMMORALITY SUCH AS THE SIMPLE AMERICAN HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THAT WAS HOW WOMEN WITH LOVERS LIVED IN THE WICKED OLD SOCIETIES
OR IN A TONE LESS ENCOURAGING TO THE VANITY OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED ARCHER REDDENED TO THE TEMPLES BUT DARED NOT MOVE OR SPEAK IT WAS AS IF HER WORDS HAD BEEN SOME RARE BUTTERFLY
I HEAR HE'S BEEN STAYING WITH YOU AT THE BLENKERS SHE SMILED OH THE CARVER DANGER IS OVER DOCTOR CARVER IS A VERY CLEVER MAN HE WANTS A RICH WIFE TO FINANCE HIS PLANS
TO CALL ON MISSUS WELLAND AFTER WHICH HE AND MISSUS WELLAND AND MAY DROVE OUT TO OLD MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S TO RECEIVE THAT VENERABLE ANCESTRESS'S BLESSING A VISIT TO MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT
AND MEDORA IS SIMPLY A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT AS A CONVERT A CONVERT TO WHAT TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AND CRAZY SOCIAL SCHEMES BUT DO YOU KNOW THEY INTEREST ME MORE THAN THE BLIND CONFORMITY TO TRADITION
MISSUS HENRY VAN DER LUYDEN LISTENED IN SILENCE TO HER COUSIN MISSUS ARCHER'S NARRATIVE IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO TELL YOURSELF IN ADVANCE THAT MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WAS ALWAYS SILENT AND THAT
AND SHE WAVED ONE OF HER TINY HANDS WITH SMALL POINTED NAILS AND ROLLS OF AGED FAT ENCIRCLING THE WRIST LIKE IVORY BRACELETS MINE WAS MODELLED IN ROME BY THE GREAT FERRIGIANI
AND BEAUFORT DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS TO BEAUFORT HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
BUT ARCHER KNEW THAT MISSUS WELLAND WAS THINKING IT'S A MISTAKE FOR ELLEN TO BE SEEN THE VERY DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL
NOW I'VE GOT YOU I WANT A GOOD GOSSIP I HEAR YOUR BALL WAS MAGNIFICENT AND I UNDERSTAND YOU INVITED MISSUS LEMUEL STRUTHERS WELL I'VE A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE WOMAN MYSELF SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER RELATIVES
WITH TWO TINY WHITE HANDS POISED LIKE GULLS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BILLOWS THE BURDEN OF MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S FLESH HAD LONG SINCE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO UP AND DOWN STAIRS
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRADITION THAT I SEE AMONG OUR OWN FRIENDS IT SEEMS STUPID TO HAVE DISCOVERED AMERICA ONLY TO MAKE IT INTO A COPY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE SMILED ACROSS THE TABLE
ON THE PLEA OF MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S HEALTH NEWLAND ARCHER CAME TO HIS MOTHER'S RESCUE EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK KNOWS WHAT YOU AND COUSIN LOUISA REPRESENT THAT'S WHY MISSUS MINGOTT FELT
TO MAKE THIS MEETING THEIR LAST HE MUST LEAVE THEIR FUTURE IN HER CARE ASKING ONLY THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP FAST HOLD OF IT DON'T DON'T BE UNHAPPY
I'M CERTAIN OF IT SIR LARRY HAS BEEN GOING IT RATHER HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY IF COUSIN LOUISA WON'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT
WITH THE PROPER EXPRESSIONS OF AMUSEMENT INCREDULITY AND GRATITUDE AND THE VISIT WAS BREAKING UP IN A VEIN OF MILD PLEASANTRY WHEN THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT THE COUNTESS OLENSKA WHO ENTERED IN BONNET AND MANTLE
AND THE BEAUTIFUL OLD CARVED FRAME OF GAINSBOROUGH'S LADY ANGELICA DU LAC MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S PORTRAIT BY HUNTINGTON IN BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT
UPHOLSTERED LIKE A SOFA AND A TOILET TABLE WITH FRIVOLOUS LACE FLOUNCES AND A GILT FRAMED MIRROR HER VISITORS WERE STARTLED AND FASCINATED BY THE FOREIGNNESS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF NEWLAND'S ENGAGEMENT YOU AND HENRY OUGHT TO KNOW AH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN DRAWING A DEEP BREATH THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH
FLUTTERED OVER MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S FACE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GUESSED AND APPROVED MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN TURNED TO MISSUS ARCHER IF LOUISA'S HEALTH ALLOWED HER TO DINE OUT
I HAD HER ORDERS TO TELL YOU THAT WE WERE ENGAGED BUT I COULDN'T IN THAT CROWD THE SMILE PASSED FROM COUNTESS OLENSKA'S EYES TO HER LIPS SHE LOOKED YOUNGER MORE LIKE THE BOLD BROWN ELLEN MINGOTT OF HIS BOYHOOD
AND MINE A PART OF YOURS SHE NODDED AND THAT'S TO BE ALL FOR EITHER OF US WELL IT IS ALL ISN'T IT
MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN STILL WORE BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT WHEN SHE WENT INTO SOCIETY OR RATHER SINCE SHE NEVER DINED OUT WHEN SHE THREW OPEN HER OWN DOORS TO RECEIVE IT HER FAIR HAIR
WERE MERELY PALE GREY INSTEAD OF PALE BLUE MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN GREETED MISSUS ARCHER WITH COUSINLY AFFABILITY PROFFERED TO NEWLAND LOW VOICED CONGRATULATIONS
SOME TIME THEN SOME TIME THAT YOU ALREADY FORESEE
YOU SHOULD HAVE MAY'S DONE NO DOUBT HE'LL HAVE IT DONE MY CHILD HER HAND IS LARGE IT'S THESE MODERN SPORTS THAT SPREAD THE JOINTS BUT THE SKIN IS WHITE AND WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE BROKE OFF FIXING HER EYES ON ARCHER'S FACE
BUT ALWAYS APPEARED TO INCLINE TO CLEMENCY TILL HER THIN LIPS WAVERING INTO THE SHADOW OF A SMILE MADE THE ALMOST INVARIABLE REPLY I SHALL FIRST HAVE TO TALK THIS OVER WITH MY HUSBAND
SHE TALKED TO HIM OF THE YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THEY HAD MET SHE HAD GROWN TIRED OF WHAT PEOPLE CALLED SOCIETY NEW YORK WAS KIND IT WAS ALMOST OPPRESSIVELY HOSPITABLE
HE TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN HAVE YOU READ THIS MORNING'S TIMES NEWLAND WHY YES SIR SAID ARCHER WHO USUALLY TOSSED OFF HALF A DOZEN PAPERS WITH HIS MORNING COFFEE
OR IF NOT SHE CONTINUED PURSUING HER OWN THOUGHT WITH A PAINFUL APPLICATION IF IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE TO HAVE GIVEN UP TO HAVE MISSED THINGS SO THAT OTHERS MAY BE SAVED FROM DISILLUSIONMENT AND MISERY
TO LONG DUOLOGUES OF SILENCE ARCHER KEPT THE TALK FROM HIS OWN AFFAIRS NOT WITH CONSCIOUS INTENTION BUT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO MISS A WORD OF HER HISTORY AND LEANING ON THE TABLE
WHO HAD WORN OUT THE PATIENCE OF ALL HER OTHER RELATIONS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED LOOKING AFTER AND PROTECTING FROM MATRIMONIAL PERILS BUT DOCTOR CARVER AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF DOCTOR CARVER
I PROMISE YOU NOT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD OUT
IT SEEMS SO TO ME SAID HIS WIFE AS IF SHE WERE PRODUCING A NEW THOUGHT I HAD NO IDEA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN CONTINUED THAT THINGS HAD COME TO SUCH A PASS
FOR A LONG TIME I'VE HOPED THIS CHANCE WOULD COME THAT I MIGHT TELL YOU HOW YOU'VE HELPED ME WHAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME ARCHER SAT STARING BENEATH FROWNING BROWS HE INTERRUPTED HER WITH A LAUGH
SHE DREW TOGETHER HER TROUBLED BROWS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF I'D NEVER BEFORE UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW MUCH THAT IS HARD AND SHABBY AND BASE
BUT STILL HE MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW NEARER HE HAD KNOWN THE LOVE THAT IS FED ON CARESSES AND FEEDS THEM
AND THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF MENTALLY ADDED AND SHE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT A MAN WHO'S JUST ENGAGED DOESN'T SPEND HIS TIME CALLING ON MARRIED WOMEN
THOSE WERE OF THE PUREST EIGHTEEN THIRTY WITH A GRIM HARMONY OF CABBAGE ROSE GARLANDED CARPETS ROSEWOOD CONSOLES ROUND ARCHED FIRE PLACES
THOUGH NON COMMITTAL BY NATURE AND TRAINING SHE WAS VERY KIND TO THE PEOPLE SHE REALLY LIKED EVEN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE FACTS WAS NOT ALWAYS A PROTECTION FROM THE CHILL THAT DESCENDED ON ONE
HE TURNED AROUND WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK HE CONCLUDED FOR HER HER EYES WERE CLINGING TO HIM DESPERATELY
WHO WANTED NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS
AND THEY MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED IF YOU WERE TO SEE THEM AT THE ALTAR
ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE YOU WILL TELL ME I KNOW THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I WILL LISTEN TO NO CAVIL UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS
WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST
IT WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO HER THAT CRAWFORD SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN DECLARING HIMSELF AND SHE WAS DISTURBED THAT EVEN A DAY SHOULD BE GONE BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO ADVANCE THAT POINT SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HIM THE WHOLE MORNING
HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
IT IS I WHO MAY RATHER EXPECT TO BE ILL FOR I AM NOW SUFFERING UNDER A VERY HEAVY DISAPPOINTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT YES FOR I AM UNABLE TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
MISSUS NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING AND COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT BUT WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR
AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
IN SUCH A CASE A PLAIN AND OPEN AVOWAL OF HIS DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS HONOUR I THINK AS WELL AS MORE CONSISTENT WITH HIS GENERAL CHARACTER BUT I WILL NOT RAISE OBJECTIONS AGAINST ANY ONE'S CONDUCT ON SO ILLIBERAL A FOUNDATION
HE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONDITION WITH HIS UNCLE FOR ATTENDING THEM WHENEVER HE MIGHT BE WANTED THE PLAY SHOULD NOT BE LOST BY HIS ABSENCE FROM BATH NORFOLK LONDON YORK WHEREVER I MAY BE SAID HE
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MISSUS GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM IT WAS THE FIRST DAY FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY DIVIDED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE
AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT I AM AS CERTAIN AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR MISTER RUSHWORTH IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF ENCOURAGEMENT
AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
THERE IS GREAT TRUTH HOWEVER IN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW URGED OF THE ALLOWANCES WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM AND IT IS MY WISH TO BE CANDID IN MY JUDGMENT OF EVERY BODY WILLOUGHBY MAY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE VERY SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR HIS CONDUCT
EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS AND ABOVE ALL HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A LOVER SO UNLIKE HIMSELF GREATLY DISTURBED HER
IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
HE DID NOT SPEAK HE DID NOT BEHAVE LIKE HIMSELF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS I WHAT CAN IT BE CAN THEY HAVE QUARRELLED WHY ELSE SHOULD HE HAVE SHEWN SUCH UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION HERE
AND I CAN PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN YOU INDEED YES
BUT FOR HIS CHILDREN'S SAKE AND HE MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HIS FAIR DAUGHTER JULIA THAT MISTER YATES DID YET MEAN TO STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER UNDER HIS ROOF THE EVENING PASSED WITH EXTERNAL SMOOTHNESS THOUGH ALMOST EVERY MIND WAS RUFFLED
AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST RELATION HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS HIS MANNER HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT
AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE HAD BEEN IDLE BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THEM HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER POWERED MARIANNE
WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER REMAINING AT HOME ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE PARK THEY FOUND WILLOUGHBY'S CURRICLE AND SERVANT IN WAITING AT THE COTTAGE AND MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED THAT HER CONJECTURE HAD BEEN JUST
MISTER RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE NOT A CREATURE
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED UNGRACIOUS GIRL BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN AND UNRESERVED
I HOPE NOT I BELIEVE NOT CRIED ELINOR I LOVE WILLOUGHBY SINCERELY LOVE HIM AND SUSPICION OF HIS INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY
YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT BUT WHY IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM CAN HE BE DECEITFUL
YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
EVERY ONE OF US EXCEPTING FANNY FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY THROUGHOUT WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE TO YOU
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
I WILL ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK AND NOT HIS SISTER HE COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING
WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED HIS NOTICE FROM HER AND THE FAREWELL VISIT AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS A VERY SHORT ONE HE WAS GONE
IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR ENGAGEMENT IF THEY ARE ENGAGED FROM MISSUS SMITH AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL LUCK AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND HIS FRIEND'S YOUNGEST SISTER
AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
IT IS ABOUT MY UNCLE'S USUAL TIME WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING I MAY PERHAPS GET AS FAR AS BANBURY TO DAY WHOSE STABLES DO YOU USE AT BATH WAS THE NEXT QUESTION
YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ABSOLUTE TYRANNY OVER THESE STATES TO PROVE THIS LET FACTS BE SUBMITTED TO A CANDID WORLD HE HAS REFUSED HIS ASSENT TO LAWS THE MOST WHOLESOME AND NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
HE WAS ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILLED AND DESOLATE THE BEST OF US WILL SOMETIMES FEEL IN SUCH A SITUATION THE BOY HAD NO FRIENDS TO CARE FOR OR TO CARE FOR HIM
HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO PREVENT THE POPULATION OF THESE STATES
REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE CAUSES WHICH IMPEL THEM TO THE SEPARATION WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
THAT A COLD TREMBLE CAME OVER HIM EVERY TIME HIS EYES WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISMAL OBJECT FROM WHICH HE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FRIGHTFUL FORM SLOWLY REAR ITS HEAD TO DRIVE HIM MAD WITH TERROR
NOR HAVE WE BEEN WANTING IN ATTENTION TO OUR BRITTISH BRETHREN WE HAVE WARNED THEM FROM TIME TO TIME OF ATTEMPTS BY THEIR LEGISLATURE TO EXTEND AN UNWARRANTABLE JURISDICTION OVER US
NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MISTER SOWERBERRY USED TO IT
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH
I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
IN GENERAL CONGRESS ASSEMBLED APPEALING TO THE SUPREME JUDGE OF THE WORLD FOR THE RECTITUDE OF OUR INTENTIONS DO IN THE NAME AND BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THESE COLONIES SOLEMNLY PUBLISH AND DECLARE
HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE OLD WOMAN'S GRASP AND DRAWING OLIVER AFTER HIM HURRIED AWAY THE NEXT DAY THE FAMILY HAVING BEEN MEANWHILE RELIEVED WITH A HALF QUARTERN LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE LEFT WITH THEM BY MISTER BUMBLE HIMSELF
AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVE DIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY
THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MISTER BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
IT WAS SPEEDILY DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE AT ONCE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE AND WITH THIS VIEW THAT HE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER ON THE VERY NEXT OCCASION OF HIS SERVICES BEING REQUIRED
KEEP BACK DAMN YOU KEEP BACK IF YOU'VE A LIFE TO LOSE NONSENSE MY GOOD MAN SAID THE UNDERTAKER WHO WAS PRETTY WELL USED TO MISERY IN ALL ITS SHAPES NONSENSE
FOR TRANSPORTING US BEYOND SEAS TO BE TRIED FOR PRETENDED OFFENCES FOR ABOLISHING THE FREE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH LAWS IN A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE ESTABLISHING THEREIN AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT
NOT AT ALL MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY HUMBLY I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR MY DEAR I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY OH DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY INTERPOSED MISSUS SOWERBERRY I AM NOBODY DON'T CONSULT ME PRAY
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
WE HAVE REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT HERE WE HAVE APPEALED TO THEIR NATIVE JUSTICE AND MAGNANIMITY AND WE HAVE CONJURED THEM BY THE TIES OF OUR COMMON KINDRED TO DISAVOW THESE USURPATIONS
AND THE TWO MOURNERS WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DAMP CLAY WITH A COLD RAIN DRIZZLING DOWN WHILE THE RAGGED BOYS WHOM THE SPECTACLE HAD ATTRACTED INTO THE CHURCHYARD PLAYED A NOISY GAME AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES
HE HAS CONSTRAINED OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TAKEN CAPTIVE ON THE HIGH SEAS TO BEAR ARMS AGAINST THEIR COUNTRY TO BECOME THE EXECUTIONERS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN OR TO FALL THEMSELVES BY THEIR HANDS
DESCENDING FROM THE TOP OF THE POST MEANWHILE WITH EDIFYING GRAVITY NO SIR REJOINED OLIVER I'M MISTER NOAH CLAYPOLE SAID THE CHARITY BOY AND YOU'RE UNDER ME TAKE DOWN THE SHUTTERS YER IDLE YOUNG RUFFIAN
BUT NOW THAT FORTUNE HAD CAST IN HIS WAY A NAMELESS ORPHAN AT WHOM EVEN THE MEANEST COULD POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN HE RETORTED ON HIM WITH INTEREST THIS AFFORDS CHARMING FOOD FOR CONTEMPLATION IT SHOWS US WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING HUMAN NATURE MAY BE MADE TO BE
TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS
WOULD REDEEM HIS PLEDGE MOST HONOURABLY HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR A SECOND OR TWO OLIVER GLANCED UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET AND OVER THE WAY
AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP DOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED
WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE SIZE OF HIS MOUTH WITH A CLASP KNIFE AND THEN CONSUMED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER AT LENGTH
SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR
AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
TRANSPORTING LARGE ARMIES OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES TO COMPLEAT THE WORKS OF DEATH DESOLATION AND TYRANNY ALREADY BEGUN WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF CRUELTY AND PERFIDY SCARCELY PARALLELED IN THE MOST BARBAROUS AGES
THAT GOVERNMENTS LONG ESTABLISHED SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED FOR LIGHT AND TRANSIENT CAUSES AND ACCORDINGLY ALL EXPERIENCE HATH SHOWN THAT MANKIND ARE MORE DISPOSED TO SUFFER WHILE EVILS ARE SUFFERABLE
HE HAS OBSTRUCTED THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY REFUSING HIS ASSENT TO LAWS FOR ESTABLISHING JUDICIARY POWERS HE HAS MADE JUDGES DEPENDENT ON HIS WILL ALONE FOR THE TENURE OF THEIR OFFICES
THE SHOP BOYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD LONG BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRANDING NOAH IN THE PUBLIC STREETS WITH THE IGNOMINIOUS EPITHETS OF LEATHERS CHARITY AND THE LIKE AND NOAH HAD BOURNE THEM WITHOUT REPLY
THE UNDERTAKER OFFERED NO REPLY TO THIS RAVING
A GREAT MANY OF THE TENEMENTS HAD SHOP FRONTS BUT THESE WERE FAST CLOSED AND MOULDERING AWAY
AND FLOUNCED OUT OF THE SHOP WHY HE WAS SO ANGRY OLIVER THAT HE FORGOT EVEN TO ASK AFTER YOU SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY LOOKING AFTER THE BEADLE AS HE STRODE DOWN THE STREET YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER WHO HAD CAREFULLY KEPT HIMSELF OUT OF SIGHT
BY DECLARING US OUT OF HIS PROTECTION AND WAGING WAR AGAINST US HE HAS PLUNDERED OUR SEAS RAVAGED OUR COASTS BURNT OUR TOWNS AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE HE IS AT THIS TIME
FOR OPPOSING WITH MANLY FIRMNESS HIS INVASIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE HE HAS REFUSED FOR A LONG TIME AFTER SUCH DISSOLUTIONS TO CAUSE OTHERS TO BE ELECTED
REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
THAT THESE UNITED COLONIES ARE AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES THAT THEY ARE ABSOLVED FROM ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN
AND OF CONSANGUINITY WE MUST THEREFORE ACQUIESCE IN THE NECESSITY WHICH DENOUNCES OUR SEPARATION AND HOLD THEM AS WE HOLD THE REST OF MANKIND ENEMIES IN WAR IN PEACE FRIENDS
IN AN ANGRY AND IMPETUOUS MANNER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TIMES WHEN HE BEGAN TO UNDO THE CHAIN THE LEGS DESISTED AND A VOICE BEGAN OPEN THE DOOR WILL YER
SEND ME A LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREAD
FOR CUTTING OFF OUR TRADE WITH ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR IMPOSING TAXES ON US WITHOUT OUR CONSENT FOR DEPRIVING US IN MANY CASES OF THE BENEFITS OF TRIAL BY JURY
AND IN A SMALL RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE LAY UPON THE GROUND SOMETHING COVERED WITH AN OLD BLANKET OLIVER SHUDDERED AS HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARD THE PLACE AND CREPT INVOLUNTARILY CLOSER TO HIS MASTER
HE HAS EXCITED DOMESTIC INSURRECTIONS AMONGST US AND HAS ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ON THE INHABITANTS OF OUR FRONTIERS THE MERCILESS INDIAN SAVAGES
IT WAS OPENED BY A YOUNG GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THE UNDERTAKER AT ONCE SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE ROOM CONTAINED TO KNOW IT WAS THE APARTMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE STEPPED IN OLIVER FOLLOWED HIM
D'YE HEAR WORK'US SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE
IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HER CLOAK WHICH THE UNDERTAKER HAD TAKEN OFF TO PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION SO THEY THREW A CAN OF COLD WATER OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CAME TO
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER
WITH THIS MISTER CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE HEADED SMALL EYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE
THE CLERGYMAN HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THE CLERK WHO WAS SITTING BY THE VESTRY ROOM FIRE SEEMED TO THINK IT BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE CAME SO THEY PUT THE BIER ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE
AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE
WHICH MANY PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN HE WILL BE AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND AN UNFINISHED COFFIN ON BLACK TRESSELS WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP LOOKED SO GLOOMY AND DEATH LIKE
AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
AND A LONG WAY BEYOND IT ON EACH SIDE ALICE ADDED EXACTLY SO
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
AT THE EDGE AND SO CAME THE LONG SCISSORS TO CUT OFF THE JAGGED PART OH SAID THE COLLAR YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPERA DANCER
AND WRITE IT DOWN I WILL IF I CAN REMEMBER IT SO LONG
I HAVEN'T INDEED ALICE SAID VERY GENTLY IT'S IN A BOOK AH WELL THEY MAY WRITE SUCH THINGS IN A BOOK HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN A CALMER TONE
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
TO BE SURE I WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID GAILY AS SHE TURNED IT ROUND FOR HIM I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A LITTLE QUEER AS I WAS SAYING THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT
THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
I SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE AN EGG SIR ALICE GENTLY EXPLAINED
WHEN HE DID SPEAK AGAIN IT WAS IN A DEEP GROWL
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU DESERVE TO BE A BARONESS SAID THE COLLAR ALL THAT I HAVE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN A BOOT JACK AND A HAIR COMB IF I ONLY HAD THE BARONY
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
BUT HE HAD THE FINEST FALSE COLLARS IN THE WORLD AND IT IS ABOUT ONE OF THESE COLLARS THAT WE ARE NOW TO HEAR A STORY IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT BEGAN TO THINK OF MARRIAGE
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
CERTAINLY SAID ALICE
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
SAID ALICE WHAT THAT MEANS NOW YOU TALK LIKE A REASONABLE CHILD SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING VERY MUCH PLEASED I MEANT BY IMPENETRABILITY
HUMPTY DUMPTY HOWEVER THE EGG ONLY GOT LARGER AND LARGER
WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY PRINTED ON IT EVEN THE MOST SECRET
THAT'S ALL SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY GOOD BYE THIS WAS RATHER SUDDEN ALICE THOUGHT BUT AFTER SUCH A VERY STRONG HINT THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE GOING
WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR NOW THERE WAS NO OTHER TO COURT AND SO HE DESPISED IT A LONG TIME PASSED AWAY THEN THE COLLAR CAME INTO THE RAG CHEST AT THE PAPER MILL
BUT THE GARTER WAS SO BASHFUL SO MODEST AND THOUGHT IT WAS A STRANGE QUESTION TO ANSWER YOU ARE CERTAINLY A GIRDLE SAID THE COLLAR THAT IS TO SAY AN INSIDE GIRDLE
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
MAYHAP YOU'LL NEVER SEE SUCH ANOTHER
I THINK IT WAS
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER I MEAN THE GIRDLE THAT WENT INTO THE WATER TUB I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER
AS HIS EYES WERE STEADILY FIXED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HE DIDN'T TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A STUFFED FIGURE AFTER ALL
THERE'S GLORY FOR YOU
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS
IS A THIN SHABBY LOOKING BIRD
IT MEANS JUST WHAT
BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
AN UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF AGE NOW IF YOU'D ASKED MY ADVICE I'D HAVE SAID LEAVE OFF AT SEVEN BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
THOUGH I HAVEN'T TIME TO LOOK IT OVER THOROUGHLY JUST NOW
IN I TOLD THEM ONCE I TOLD THEM TWICE THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE I TOOK A KETTLE LARGE AND NEW
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
HIM AND THEN HE WAS CONDEMNED I SHALL NOW BE OBLIGED TO ASK THE HAIR COMB IT IS SURPRISING HOW WELL YOU PRESERVE YOUR TEETH MISS SAID THE COLLAR
THAT I SHALL NOT TELL YOU SAID THE GARTER
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
FOR WE CAN NEVER KNOW IF WE MAY NOT IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALSO COME INTO THE RAG CHEST AND BE MADE INTO WHITE PAPER AND THEN HAVE OUR
ALICE ASKED DOUBTFULLY OF COURSE IT MUST HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID WITH A SHORT LAUGH MY NAME MEANS THE SHAPE I AM
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
SHE NEVER FINISHED THE SENTENCE FOR AT THIS MOMENT
THEY ARE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR NESTS UNDER SUN DIALS ALSO THEY LIVE ON CHEESE
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
SHE WAS SO FEROCIOUS MY OWN HAIR COMB WAS IN LOVE WITH ME SHE LOST ALL HER TEETH
THE LITTLE FISHES ARE IN BED I SAID TO HIM I SAID IT PLAIN THEN YOU MUST WAKE THEM UP AGAIN I SAID IT VERY LOUD AND CLEAR
ALICE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS SHE TOOK OUT HER MEMORANDUM BOOK AND WORKED THE SUM FOR HIM
ANXIETY FOR THE QUEER CREATURE THAT WALL IS SO VERY NARROW WHAT TREMENDOUSLY EASY RIDDLES YOU ASK HUMPTY DUMPTY GROWLED OUT
SHE CORRECTED HERSELF ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BEAUTIFUL CRAVAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
AND A BEAUTIFUL ONE AS YOU SAY IT'S A PRESENT FROM THE WHITE KING AND QUEEN THERE NOW IS IT REALLY SAID ALICE QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
I LIKE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS BEST SHE SAID AT LAST
SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
IT IS SAID THAT SHELLEY WROTE PUSSY CAT MEW AND DEAN SWIFT LITTLE BO PEEP AND THESE ASSERTIONS ARE AS DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE AS TO PROVE SOME OF THE OLDER VERSES HOWEVER
AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
SAID THE OLD WOMAN I AM GOING OVER THE HILL TOP MYSELF AND I WILL SEND THE SHEEP BACK TO YOU SO SHE GOT UPON HER FEET AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE GIRL HEARD HER SAYING AS SHE WALKED AWAY LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER SHEEP
AND AFTER PONDERING THE MATTER FOR A TIME SHE BECAME DISCOURAGED AND THINKING SHE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE THE TAILS WERE FOUND SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO BEWAIL HER MISFORTUNE BUT AMIDST HER TEARS SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER NEEDLE AND THREAD
LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
FASTENED ABOUT THE WAIST WITH A PRETTY PINK SASH AND THERE WERE WHITE RUFFLES AROUND HER NECK AND PINK RIBBONS IN HER HAIR ALL THE SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES UPON THE HILLS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SOON CAME TO KNOW LITTLE BO PEEP VERY WELL INDEED
ARE EVIDENTLY DRAWN FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHILE THEY ARE TAKEN ALTOGETHER A HAPPY UNION OF RHYME WIT
IS BASED UPON VERY MEAGER AND UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC WAS ISSUED BY JOHN NEWBURY OF LONDON ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND THE FIRST AUTHENTIC AMERICAN EDITION
ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
THAT SHE BEGAN TO COUGH AND THIS MADE THE GIRL REMEMBER THAT HER FLOCK HAD STRAYED AWAY I REALLY MUST GO AND FIND MY SHEEP SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND THEN I SHALL BE SURE TO NOTICE THEIR TAILS AND SEE IF THEY WAG THEM SIT STILL MY CHILD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
NOR ARE THEY EVER RECALLED WITHOUT BRINGING BACK WITH THEM MYRIADS OF SLUMBERING FEELINGS AND HALF FORGOTTEN IMAGES WE HEAR THE SWEET LOW VOICE OF THE MOTHER SINGING SOFT LULLABIES TO HER DARLING
OH YES THEY KNOW ME EVERY ONE AND DO NOT YOU KNOW THE SHEEP I CAN CALL EVERY ONE BY NAME SAID BO PEEP CONFIDENTLY FOR THOUGH I AM SO YOUNG A SHEPHERDESS I AM FOND OF MY SHEEP AND KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM
INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
GOOD MORNING MOTHER CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO DEARIE RETURNED THE WOMAN IN A CRACKED VOICE BUT I WILL SIT BY YOUR SIDE AND REST FOR A TIME THE GIRL MADE ROOM ON THE MOUND BESIDE HER
LAYING ASIDE HER CROOK AND HER BROAD STRAW HAT WITH ITS PINK RIBBONS DEVOTED HER TIME TO SEWING AND MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER AGED MOTHER ONE DAY WHILE THUS OCCUPIED
PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
THE BALLADS OF THE NURSERY FOLLOW US FROM CHILDHOOD TO OLD AGE AND THEY ARE READILY BROUGHT FROM MEMORY'S RECESSES AT ANY TIME TO AMUSE OUR CHILDREN OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE COLLECTION OF JINGLES WE KNOW AND LOVE AS THE MELODIES OF MOTHER GOOSE
AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
BUT WHERE IS YOUR CROOK ON THE GRASS BESIDE ME AND WHERE ARE YOUR SHEEP BO PEEP LOOKED UP AND COULD NOT SEE THEM THEY MUST HAVE STRAYED OVER THE TOP OF THE HILL SHE SAID AND I WILL GO AND SEEK THEM
DO NOT BE IN A HURRY CROAKED THE OLD WOMAN THEY WILL RETURN PRESENTLY WITHOUT YOUR TROUBLING TO FIND THEM DO YOU THINK SO ASKED BO PEEP OF COURSE DO NOT THE SHEEP KNOW YOU
AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
PERHAPS NO MAN ALIVE COULD TELL YET THERE WERE STILL THREE UPON THAT ISLAND SILVER AND OLD MORGAN AND BEN GUNN WHO HAD EACH TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THESE CRIMES AS EACH HAD HOPED IN VAIN TO SHARE IN THE REWARD
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
BUT WERE AT SEA WITH IT BESIDES IN SAFETY YES SAID ONE THAT'S FLINT SURE ENOUGH J F AND A SCORE BELOW WITH A CLOVE HITCH TO IT SO HE DONE EVER
AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
BUT THAT'S A TRIFLE YOU LOOK THERE THAT'S WHY AND HE CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR A PAPER THAT I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED NONE OTHER THAN THE CHART ON YELLOW PAPER
AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
WHO'S THAT SAYS ONE THAT WHY THAT'S JOHN SILVER I KNOWED HIM WELL SAYS ANOTHER AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CHAINS A JANGLE AS YOU GO ABOUT AND REACH FOR THE OTHER BUOY
THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
THIRD YOU WOULDN'T LET US GO AT THEM UPON THE MARCH
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
YOU'LL BE CAP'N NEXT I SHOULDN'T WONDER JUST OBLIGE ME WITH THAT TORCH AGAIN WILL YOU THIS PIPE DON'T DRAW
NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
AND THE TREASURE IN THE HOLD OF HER BY THUNDER WELL WHO CROSSED ME
AH IT'S A FINE DANCE I'M WITH YOU THERE AND LOOKS MIGHTY LIKE A HORNPIPE IN A ROPE'S END AT EXECUTION DOCK BY LONDON TOWN IT DOES BUT WHO DONE IT WHY IT WAS ANDERSON AND HANDS AND YOU GEORGE MERRY
YOU WANT TO PLAY BOOTY THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU AND THEN FOURTH THERE'S THIS HERE BOY IS THAT ALL ASKED SILVER QUIETLY ENOUGH TOO RETORTED GEORGE
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
HESITATING AS HE SET DOWN EACH FOOT BUT HOLDING HIS CLOSED RIGHT HAND IN FRONT OF HIM STEP UP LAD CRIED SILVER I WON'T EAT YOU
AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
OH REPLIED GEORGE YOU DON'T BE UNDER NO KIND OF APPREHENSION WE'RE ALL SQUARE WE ARE FIRST YOU'VE MADE A HASH OF THIS CRUISE YOU'LL BE A BOLD MAN TO SAY NO TO THAT SECOND
AND THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS THE HOUSE HERE THEY COME SAID I AND I RETURNED TO MY FORMER POSITION FOR IT SEEMED BENEATH MY DIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD FIND ME WATCHING THEM WELL LET EM COME LAD LET EM COME
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
BUT THIS TOPS THE STIFFEST YARN TO NOTHING SILVER PAUSED AND I COULD SEE BY THE FACES OF GEORGE AND HIS LATE COMRADES THAT THESE WORDS HAD NOT BEEN SAID IN VAIN THAT'S FOR NUMBER ONE
MIGHTY PRETTY SAID GEORGE BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET AWAY WITH IT AND US NO SHIP SILVER SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH A HAND AGAINST THE WALL
A BIBLE WITH A BIT CUT OUT RETURNED SILVER DERISIVELY NOT IT
BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
WE'LL ALL SWING AND SUN DRY FOR YOUR BUNGLING
I MADE A HASH O THIS CRUISE DID I WELL NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANTED AND YOU ALL KNOW IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT WE'D A BEEN ABOARD THE HISPANIOLA THIS NIGHT AS EVER WAS EVERY MAN OF US ALIVE AND FIT AND FULL OF GOOD PLUM DUFF
WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
AND NOW SHIPMATES THIS BLACK SPOT TAIN'T MUCH GOOD NOW IS IT DICK'S CROSSED HIS LUCK AND SPOILED HIS BIBLE AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL IT'LL DO TO KISS THE BOOK ON STILL WON'T IT GROWLED DICK WHO WAS EVIDENTLY
I'VE STILL A SHOT IN MY LOCKER THE DOOR OPENED AND THE FIVE MEN STANDING HUDDLED TOGETHER JUST INSIDE PUSHED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER FORWARD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMICAL TO SEE HIS SLOW ADVANCE
WELL WHAT IS IT ANYWAY AH DEPOSED' THAT'S IT IS IT VERY PRETTY WROTE TO BE SURE LIKE PRINT I SWEAR YOUR HAND O WRITE GEORGE
THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
IN A VOICE THAT MARKED HIS DISPLEASURE TO RESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR DAUGHTER RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS IS THE DUTY OF US ALL THE PECULIAR DUTY OF A YOUNG MAN
BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
AND NEVER HUNG BACK FOR AS POOR GINGER SAID IT WAS NO USE
I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
IT VERY MUCH WEAKENED MY SIGHT AND WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLARE OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO MY EYES SEVERAL TIMES I STUMBLED OVER THE THRESHOLD AND COULD SCARCELY SEE WHERE I WAS GOING
HE SAID BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FOREMAN CAME JUST AS WE WERE STARTING AND WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDREDWEIGHT MORE PUT ON TO SAVE HIM TROUBLE AND I MUST GET ON WITH IT AS WELL AS I CAN
AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
AT THIS SALE OF COURSE I FOUND MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH THE OLD BROKEN DOWN HORSES SOME LAME SOME BROKEN WINDED SOME OLD AND SOME THAT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERCIFUL TO SHOOT
WE MUST NOW BE LOOKING OUT FOR A QUIET GENTEEL PLACE FOR HIM
TO LEAD A GOOD FASHION THAN TO FOLLOW A BAD ONE A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN DO NOT USE CHECK REINS NOW OUR CARRIAGE HORSES HAVE NOT WORN THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
WOULD SET HIM RIGHT UP BEING AS HOW HIS WIND WAS NOT BROKEN I'VE HAD THE TENDING OF HIM THESE TEN DAYS PAST AND A GRATEFULLER PLEASANTER ANIMAL I NEVER MET WITH
BUT IS IT NOT A HEAVY LOAD SHE SAID
UPON THIS ADVICE SKINNER RATHER UNWILLINGLY I THINK GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL FED AND CARED FOR AND THE STABLE MAN HAPPILY FOR ME CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS
LET IT BE EVER SO STEEP OR THE DAY EVER SO HOT UNLESS INDEED WHEN THE DRIVER WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT MANAGE IT AND SOMETIMES I WAS SO FEVERED AND WORN
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
I ARCHED MY POOR THIN NECK RAISED MY TAIL A LITTLE AND THREW OUT MY LEGS AS WELL AS I COULD FOR THEY WERE VERY STIFF WHAT IS THE LOWEST YOU WILL TAKE FOR HIM
AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
THAT A YOUNGER HORSE WAS BOUGHT IN MY PLACE I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE WHAT I SUFFERED AT THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD HEARD HORSES SPEAK OF IT BUT HAD NEVER MYSELF HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE EVIL
I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
THAT I COULD HARDLY TOUCH MY FOOD HOW I USED TO LONG FOR THE NICE BRAN MASH WITH NITER IN IT THAT JERRY USED TO GIVE US ON SATURDAY NIGHTS IN HOT WEATHER
AND IN A MOMENT I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO MY VERY KNEES WHAT A COMFORT IT WAS THEN I TOSSED IT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE ACHING STIFFNESS OUT OF MY NECK
GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
THE WIND SEEMED TO HAVE LULLED OFF AFTER THAT FURIOUS BLAST WHICH TORE UP THE TREE IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER STILLER AND STILLER
HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
SO BACK WE WENT AND ROUND BY THE CROSSROADS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BRIDGE IT WAS VERY NEARLY DARK WE COULD JUST SEE THAT THE WATER WAS OVER THE MIDDLE OF IT
AND TWOULD BE WORTH A GENTLEMAN'S WHILE TO GIVE A FIVE POUND NOTE FOR HIM AND LET HIM HAVE A CHANCE I'LL BE BOUND HE'D BE WORTH TWENTY POUNDS NEXT SPRING THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED UP EAGERLY
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF POVERTY AND HARD TIMES HAD HARDENED THEM ALL OVER BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT I WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY USED THE LAST OF MY STRENGTH IN SERVING POOR AND SHABBY BUT KIND AND HUMAN
DO SO I AM NOW GOING THERE THEY WALKED FORWARD AND I WAS LED BEHIND THE BOY COULD HARDLY CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS PLEASURE I HAD A GOOD FEED AT THE INN
JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
AND HE WOULD EVEN WHIP ME UNDER THE BELLY AND FLIP THE LASH OUT AT MY HEAD INDIGNITIES LIKE THESE TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME TERRIBLY BUT STILL I DID MY BEST
A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE IF A MAN OF BUSINESS HAD TO EXAMINE EVERY CAB HORSE BEFORE HE HIRED IT THE MAN KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS OF COURSE THERE GET IN AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE MY GENTLE FRIEND HAD TO OBEY
AND SOME CORDIAL WAS POURED INTO MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING WAS COVERED OVER ME I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I LAY THERE BUT I FOUND MY LIFE COMING BACK AND A KIND VOICED MAN WAS PATTING ME
I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
LOOK AT HIS MANE AND TAIL I WISH YOU WOULD LOOK INTO HIS MOUTH AND THEN YOU COULD TELL THOUGH HE IS SO VERY THIN HIS EYES ARE NOT SUNK LIKE SOME OLD HORSES THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
I HAD STILL A GOOD MANE AND TAIL WHICH DID SOMETHING FOR MY APPEARANCE I PRICKED MY EARS AND LOOKED AT HIM THERE'S A HORSE WILLIE THAT HAS KNOWN BETTER DAYS
WITH VOICES THAT I COULD TRUST THERE WAS ONE TOTTERING OLD MAN WHO TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO ME AND I TO HIM BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME
BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND GOOD PACES THEY CAN'T BE BETTER OH GRANDPAPA HOW GLAD I AM YOU BOUGHT HIM SO AM I MY BOY BUT HE HAS TO THANK YOU MORE THAN ME
MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
THE FARMER SLOWLY FELT MY LEGS WHICH WERE MUCH SWELLED AND STRAINED THEN HE LOOKED AT MY MOUTH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN I SHOULD SAY JUST TROT HIM OUT WILL YOU
AND WAS THEN GENTLY RIDDEN HOME BY A SERVANT OF MY NEW MASTER'S AND TURNED INTO A LARGE MEADOW WITH A SHED IN ONE CORNER OF IT MISTER THOROUGHGOOD FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF MY BENEFACTOR
A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
SOON BEGAN TO TELL ON MY CONDITION AND MY SPIRITS I HAD A GOOD CONSTITUTION FROM MY MOTHER AND I WAS NEVER STRAINED WHEN I WAS YOUNG SO THAT I HAD A BETTER CHANCE THAN MANY HORSES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKED BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
SOME ONE CAME AND LOOSENED THE THROAT STRAP OF MY BRIDLE AND UNDID THE TRACES WHICH KEPT THE COLLAR SO TIGHT UPON ME SOME ONE SAID HE'S DEAD HE'LL NEVER GET UP AGAIN THEN
YOU HAD DONKEYS IN YOUR SCHOOL HOW YOU MUST HAVE STUDIED THE MARIONETTE ASHAMED AND HURT BY THOSE WORDS DID NOT ANSWER BUT TAKING HIS GLASS OF MILK RETURNED TO HIS FATHER FROM THAT DAY ON FOR MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS
AND ANSWERED IN THE SAME TONGUE I AM LAMP WICK THEN HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND DIED OH MY POOR LAMP WICK SAID PINOCCHIO IN A FAINT VOICE AS HE WIPED HIS EYES WITH SOME STRAW HE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE GROUND
I AM GOING TO THE MARKET PLACE TO BUY MYSELF A COAT A CAP AND A PAIR OF SHOES WHEN I COME BACK I'LL BE SO DRESSED UP YOU WILL THINK I AM A RICH MAN HE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP THE ROAD TO THE VILLAGE LAUGHING AND SINGING SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED
HEAD TURNED TO ONE SIDE ARMS HANGING LIMP AND LEGS TWISTED UNDER HIM AFTER A LONG LONG LOOK PINOCCHIO SAID TO HIMSELF WITH GREAT CONTENT HOW RIDICULOUS I WAS AS A MARIONETTE
LOOKED AT HIM WITH WIDE AWAKE BLUE EYES DARK BROWN HAIR AND HAPPY SMILING LIPS SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH SPLENDOR THE MARIONETTE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING HE RUBBED HIS EYES TWO OR THREE TIMES WONDERING IF HE WERE STILL ASLEEP
WHO AM A FINE SWIMMER WILL CARRY YOU SAFELY TO THE SHORE DREAMS MY BOY ANSWERED GEPPETTO SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SMILING SADLY
AS HE LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OPEN JAWS OF HIS NEW HOME THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO ESCAPE HE WHISPERED TURNING TO HIS FATHER THE SHARK IS FAST ASLEEP THE SEA IS CALM AND THE NIGHT IS AS BRIGHT AS DAY FOLLOW ME CLOSELY DEAR FATHER AND WE SHALL SOON BE SAVED
AND SHOWED HIM HOW TO DRAW THE WATER PINOCCHIO SET TO WORK AS WELL AS HE KNEW HOW BUT LONG BEFORE HE HAD PULLED UP THE ONE HUNDRED BUCKETS HE WAS TIRED OUT AND DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION HE HAD NEVER WORKED SO HARD IN HIS LIFE
THEN GO TO THAT WELL YOU SEE YONDER AND DRAW ONE HUNDRED BUCKETFULS OF WATER VERY WELL AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED I SHALL GIVE YOU A GLASS OF WARM SWEET MILK I AM SATISFIED
YOU ARE AS LIGHT AS SEA SHELLS ANSWERED THE TUNNY WHO WAS AS LARGE AS A TWO YEAR OLD HORSE AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE SHORE PINOCCHIO WAS THE FIRST TO JUMP TO THE GROUND TO HELP HIS OLD FATHER THEN HE TURNED TO THE FISH AND SAID TO HIM
IN REWARD FOR YOUR KIND HEART I FORGIVE YOU FOR ALL YOUR OLD MISCHIEF BOYS WHO LOVE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY ARE OLD AND SICK DESERVE PRAISE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE HELD UP AS MODELS OF OBEDIENCE AND GOOD BEHAVIOR
THEY HAVE THE POWER OF MAKING THEIR HOMES GAY AND NEW WITH HAPPINESS I WONDER WHERE THE OLD PINOCCHIO OF WOOD HAS HIDDEN HIMSELF THERE HE IS ANSWERED GEPPETTO AND HE POINTED TO A LARGE MARIONETTE LEANING AGAINST A CHAIR
EATING LIVE FISH THEY WRIGGLED SO THAT NOW AND AGAIN ONE OF THEM SLIPPED OUT OF THE OLD MAN'S MOUTH AND ESCAPED INTO THE DARKNESS UNDER THE TABLE AT THIS SIGHT THE POOR MARIONETTE WAS FILLED WITH SUCH GREAT AND SUDDEN HAPPINESS
SAID PINOCCHIO LET US SEE FOR OURSELVES
WHEN PINOCCHIO RETURNED HOME HIS FATHER ASKED HIM AND WHERE IS THE NEW SUIT I COULDN'T FIND ONE TO FIT ME I SHALL HAVE TO LOOK AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY THAT NIGHT PINOCCHIO INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED AT TEN O'CLOCK WAITED UNTIL MIDNIGHT
TUNNY YOU ARRIVED AT THE RIGHT MOMENT I IMPLORE YOU FOR THE LOVE YOU BEAR YOUR CHILDREN THE LITTLE TUNNIES TO HELP US OR WE ARE LOST WITH GREAT PLEASURE INDEED HANG ONTO MY TAIL BOTH OF YOU AND LET ME LEAD YOU
ASKED THE LITTLE OLD MAN MORE AND MORE WORRIED AS HE TRIED TO PIERCE THE FARAWAY SHADOWS HERE I AM SEARCHING ON ALL SIDES AND I SEE NOTHING BUT SEA AND SKY
AT ALL THESE QUESTIONS TUMBLING OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SNAIL ANSWERED CALM AS EVER MY DEAR PINOCCHIO THE FAIRY IS LYING ILL IN A HOSPITAL IN A HOSPITAL YES INDEED SHE HAS BEEN STRICKEN WITH TROUBLE AND ILLNESS
A LARGE SHIP ALSO SUFFERED THE SAME FATE THE SAILORS WERE ALL SAVED BUT THE SHIP WENT RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND THE SAME TERRIBLE SHARK THAT SWALLOWED ME SWALLOWED MOST OF IT WHAT SWALLOWED A SHIP ASKED PINOCCHIO IN ASTONISHMENT
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE BUILT A ROLLING CHAIR STRONG AND COMFORTABLE TO TAKE HIS OLD FATHER OUT FOR AN AIRING ON BRIGHT SUNNY DAYS IN THE EVENING THE MARIONETTE STUDIED BY LAMPLIGHT
HE FELT HE COULD NOT GO ON MUCH LONGER AND THE SHORE WAS STILL FAR AWAY HE SWAM A FEW MORE STROKES
TO MY OWN GOOD LUCK THAT SHIP WAS LOADED WITH MEAT PRESERVED FOODS CRACKERS BREAD BOTTLES OF WINE RAISINS CHEESE COFFEE SUGAR WAX CANDLES AND BOXES OF MATCHES
NOW I SHALL NEVER NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN
HE FOUND OUT I WAS INNOCENT WHEN I CAUGHT THE WEASELS AND HE LET ME GO
WE ARE OLD TIRED AND SICK SICK REPEATED THE CAT ADDIO FALSE FRIENDS ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE YOU CHEATED ME ONCE BUT YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ME AGAIN BELIEVE US TODAY WE ARE TRULY POOR AND STARVING
I WAS JUST GOING TO BUY SOME CLOTHES HERE TAKE THEM LITTLE SNAIL AND GIVE THEM TO MY GOOD FAIRY WHAT ABOUT THE NEW CLOTHES WHAT DOES THAT MATTER I SHOULD LIKE TO SELL THESE RAGS I HAVE ON TO HELP HER MORE GO AND HURRY
AT ONE GULP THE ONLY THING HE SPAT OUT WAS THE MAIN MAST
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR FATHER AND I SAID PERHAPS BUT HOW AND HE SAID GET ON MY BACK I'LL TAKE YOU THERE WE FLEW ALL NIGHT LONG AND NEXT MORNING THE FISHERMEN WERE LOOKING TOWARD THE SEA CRYING THERE IS A POOR LITTLE MAN DROWNING AND I KNEW IT WAS YOU
THERE HE FOUND A NEW SUIT A NEW HAT AND A PAIR OF SHOES AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEATHER PURSE ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR RETURNS
THIS COTTAGE WAS GIVEN TO ME YESTERDAY BY A LITTLE GOAT WITH BLUE HAIR AND WHERE DID THE GOAT GO ASKED PINOCCHIO I DON'T KNOW
ASKED GEPPETTO TO LOOK FOR A HOUSE OR A HUT WHERE THEY WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE US A BITE OF BREAD AND A BIT OF STRAW TO SLEEP ON THEY HAD NOT TAKEN A HUNDRED STEPS WHEN THEY SAW TWO ROUGH LOOKING INDIVIDUALS SITTING ON A STONE BEGGING FOR ALMS
AND INSTEAD OF MAKING EIGHT BASKETS HE MADE SIXTEEN AFTER THAT HE WENT TO BED AND FELL ASLEEP AS HE SLEPT HE DREAMED OF HIS FAIRY BEAUTIFUL SMILING AND HAPPY WHO KISSED HIM AND SAID TO HIM BRAVO PINOCCHIO
HE THREW THEM AROUND THE OLD MAN'S NECK
HE NOTICED A LARGE SNAIL CRAWLING OUT OF SOME BUSHES DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME SAID THE SNAIL YES AND NO DO YOU REMEMBER THE SNAIL THAT LIVED WITH THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR DO YOU NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR YOU ONE NIGHT AND GAVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
IT WAS THE FOX AND THE CAT BUT ONE COULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM THEY LOOKED SO MISERABLE THE CAT AFTER PRETENDING TO BE BLIND FOR SO MANY YEARS
THAT HE ALMOST DROPPED IN A FAINT HE WANTED TO LAUGH HE WANTED TO CRY HE WANTED TO SAY A THOUSAND AND ONE THINGS BUT ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND STILL STUTTERING AND STAMMERING BROKENLY AT LAST WITH A GREAT EFFORT
WHO TOOK ME TO THE INN OF THE RED LOBSTER THERE THEY ATE LIKE WOLVES AND I LEFT THE INN ALONE AND I MET THE ASSASSINS IN THE WOOD I RAN AND THEY RAN AFTER ME ALWAYS AFTER ME
AND SHE HASN'T A PENNY LEFT WITH WHICH TO BUY A BITE OF BREAD REALLY OH HOW SORRY I AM MY POOR DEAR LITTLE FAIRY IF I HAD A MILLION I SHOULD RUN TO HER WITH IT BUT I HAVE ONLY FIFTY PENNIES HERE THEY ARE
AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY AT THAT VERY MOMENT PINOCCHIO AWOKE AND OPENED WIDE HIS EYES WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE AND HIS JOY WHEN ON LOOKING HIMSELF OVER HE SAW THAT HE WAS NO LONGER A MARIONETTE
GEPPETTO AND PINOCCHIO AS YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE DID NOT REFUSE THE INVITATION INDEED INSTEAD OF HANGING ONTO THE TAIL THEY THOUGHT IT BETTER TO CLIMB ON THE TUNNY'S BACK ARE WE TOO HEAVY ASKED PINOCCHIO HEAVY NOT IN THE LEAST
TOWARD THE FAINT LIGHT WHICH GLOWED IN THE DISTANCE AS HE WALKED HIS FEET SPLASHED IN A POOL OF GREASY AND SLIPPERY WATER WHICH HAD SUCH A HEAVY SMELL OF FISH FRIED IN OIL THAT PINOCCHIO THOUGHT IT WAS LENT THE FARTHER ON HE WENT THE BRIGHTER AND CLEARER GREW THE TINY LIGHT
TO LOOK FOR YOU IN AMERICA AND I SAID TO HIM OH
SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK YESTERDAY SHE WENT AWAY BLEATING SADLY AND IT SEEMED TO ME SHE SAID POOR PINOCCHIO I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN THE SHARK MUST HAVE EATEN HIM BY THIS TIME
WHO IS IT SAID A LITTLE VOICE FROM WITHIN
AT THIS WARM GREETING THE POOR TUNNY WHO WAS NOT USED TO SUCH TENDERNESS WEPT LIKE A CHILD HE FELT SO EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED THAT HE TURNED QUICKLY PLUNGED INTO THE SEA AND DISAPPEARED IN THE MEANTIME DAY HAD DAWNED
IF HE IS NOT DEAD THEN HE IS SURELY ALIVE
ANSWERED THE OLD MAN RUBBING HIS EYES ARE YOU REALLY MY OWN DEAR PINOCCHIO YES YES YES IT IS I LOOK AT ME AND YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME HAVEN'T YOU OH MY DEAR FATHER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AND TO THINK THAT I
SAID PINOCCHIO BOWING POLITELY
AND BENDING LOW OVER HIM HE ASKED WHO ARE YOU
NEAR A CLUMP OF TREES A TINY COTTAGE BUILT OF STRAW
OR AWAKE AND DECIDED HE MUST BE AWAKE AND WHERE IS FATHER HE CRIED SUDDENLY HE RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND THERE STOOD GEPPETTO GROWN YEARS YOUNGER OVERNIGHT SPICK AND SPAN IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND GAY AS A LARK IN THE MORNING
MY DONKEY HAS DRAWN THE WATER FOR ME BUT NOW THAT POOR ANIMAL IS DYING WILL YOU TAKE ME TO SEE HIM SAID PINOCCHIO GLADLY AS SOON AS PINOCCHIO WENT INTO THE STABLE HE SPIED A LITTLE DONKEY LYING ON A BED OF STRAW IN THE CORNER OF THE STABLE
TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT IN WHICH TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE SHARK BEING VERY OLD AND SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA AND HEART TROUBLE WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN BECAUSE OF THIS PINOCCHIO WAS ABLE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SKY FILLED WITH STARS
WITH SOME OF THE MONEY HE HAD EARNED HE BOUGHT HIMSELF A SECONDHAND VOLUME THAT HAD A FEW PAGES MISSING AND WITH THAT HE LEARNED TO READ IN A VERY SHORT TIME AS FAR AS WRITING WAS CONCERNED HE USED A LONG STICK
THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST TRY TO ESCAPE ESCAPE HOW WE CAN RUN OUT OF THE SHARK'S MOUTH AND DIVE INTO THE SEA YOU SPEAK WELL BUT I CANNOT SWIM MY DEAR PINOCCHIO WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER YOU CAN CLIMB ON MY SHOULDERS AND I
HE WAS WORN OUT FROM HUNGER AND TOO MUCH WORK AFTER LOOKING AT HIM A LONG TIME HE SAID TO HIMSELF I KNOW THAT DONKEY
EXACTLY AND YOU I AM THE TUNNY YOUR COMPANION IN THE SHARK'S STOMACH AND HOW DID YOU ESCAPE I IMITATED YOUR EXAMPLE
OH HO WHERE IS THE OWNER OF THE HUT CRIED PINOCCHIO VERY MUCH SURPRISED HERE I AM UP HERE FATHER AND SON LOOKED UP TO THE CEILING AND THERE ON A BEAM SAT THE TALKING CRICKET OH MY DEAR CRICKET
BUT PINOCCHIO THINKING HIS FATHER WAS FRIGHTENED TRIED TO COMFORT HIM BY SAYING COURAGE FATHER IN A FEW MOMENTS WE SHALL BE SAFE ON LAND BUT WHERE IS THAT BLESSED SHORE
SAID THE FARMER WHAT SHOULD I DO I WHO HAVE PAID MY GOOD MONEY FOR HIM BUT YOU SEE HE WAS MY FRIEND YOUR FRIEND A CLASSMATE OF MINE WHAT SHOUTED FARMER JOHN BURSTING OUT LAUGHING
PINOCCHIO GOT UP EVERY MORNING JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING AND WENT TO THE FARM TO DRAW WATER AND EVERY DAY HE WAS GIVEN A GLASS OF WARM MILK FOR HIS POOR OLD FATHER WHO GREW STRONGER AND BETTER DAY BY DAY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX PINOCCHIO FINALLY CEASES TO BE A MARIONETTE AND BECOMES A BOY MY DEAR FATHER WE ARE SAVED CRIED THE MARIONETTE
UNTIL TODAY I HAVE WORKED FOR MY FATHER NOW I SHALL HAVE TO WORK FOR MY MOTHER ALSO GOOD BY AND I HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON THE SNAIL MUCH AGAINST HER USUAL HABIT BEGAN TO RUN LIKE A LIZARD UNDER A SUMMER SUN
I KNEW YOU ALSO
THEN IT WAS SHE IT WAS MY DEAR LITTLE FAIRY CRIED OUT PINOCCHIO SOBBING BITTERLY AFTER HE HAD CRIED A LONG TIME HE WIPED HIS EYES AND THEN HE MADE A BED OF STRAW FOR OLD GEPPETTO HE LAID HIM ON IT AND SAID TO THE TALKING CRICKET
HE TREMBLED VERY MUCH THOUGH FOR EVEN IN HIS TERROR OLIVER COULD SEE THAT THE KNIFE QUIVERED IN THE AIR WHAT'S THAT SAID THE JEW
YES YES I WILL TO SAY GOOD B'YE TO YOU REPLIED OLIVER I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN DICK I KNOW I SHALL
THE JEW TOOK OUT ANOTHER SO SMALL THAT IT LAY IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME VERY MINUTE INSCRIPTION ON IT FOR THE JEW LAID IT FLAT UPON THE TABLE AND SHADING IT WITH HIS HAND PORED OVER IT LONG AND EARNESTLY
ALL THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THESE PRETTY THINGS MY DEAR SAID THE JEW LAYING HIS HAND UPON IT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER AH SAID THE JEW TURNING RATHER PALE THEY
WHO ARE PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHERS WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAVE PAUPERS TO DO WITH SOUL OR SPIRIT IT'S QUITE ENOUGH THAT WE LET EM HAVE LIVE BODIES IF YOU HAD KEPT THE BOY ON GRUEL MA'AM
THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY PRETTY PERHAPS BUT THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF COLOUR IN THEIR FACES AND LOOKED QUITE STOUT AND HEARTY BEING REMARKABLY FREE AND AGREEABLE IN THEIR MANNERS OLIVER THOUGHT THEM VERY NICE GIRLS INDEED
HE WOULD STOP EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN WHEN THERE WAS THE LEAST NOISE BELOW AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF HE WOULD GO ON WHISTLING AND STIRRING AGAIN AS BEFORE ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD ROUSED HIMSELF FROM SLEEP HE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY AWAKE
YOU'VE OVER FED HIM MA'AM YOU'VE
AS THE JEW UTTERED THESE WORDS HIS BRIGHT DARK EYES WHICH HAD BEEN STARING VACANTLY BEFORE HIM FELL ON OLIVER'S FACE THE BOY'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS IN MUTE CURIOUSITY AND ALTHOUGH THE RECOGNITION WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
HERE THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS HAD NOT AT ALL IMPROVED SOWERBERRY HAD NOT YET RETURNED AND OLIVER CONTINUED TO KICK
RIGHTLY CONCEIVING IT HIGHLY EXPEDIENT TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE AND ROUSE THE INDIGNATION OF THE GENTLEMAN AFORESAID THE GENTLEMAN'S NOTICE WAS VERY SOON ATTRACTED FOR HE HAD NOT WALKED THREE PACES WHEN HE TURNED ANGRILY ROUND
BUT THINKING THAT PERHAPS HIS FONDNESS FOR THE DODGER AND THE OTHER BOYS COST HIM A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY HE ONLY CAST A DEFERENTIAL LOOK AT THE JEW AND ASKED IF HE MIGHT GET UP
JUST STEP UP TO SOWERBERRY'S WITH YOUR CANE AND SEE WHAT'S BEST TO BE DONE DON'T SPARE HIM BUMBLE NO
CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY ASKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A CROWD AT THE EXECUTION THAT MORNING THIS MADE HIM WONDER MORE AND MORE
SOMETIMES HE STOPPED AT THE FIRE PLACE AND SOMETIMES AT THE DOOR MAKING BELIEVE THAT HE WAS STARING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT INTO SHOP WINDOWS AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD LOOK CONSTANTLY ROUND HIM FOR FEAR OF THIEVES
AS GOD SEND FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR NATURE FEW SO YOUNG MAY EVER HAVE CAUSE TO POUR OUT BEFORE HIM FOR A LONG TIME OLIVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THIS ATTITUDE THE CANDLE WAS BURNING LOW IN THE SOCKET
ACCORDING TO ALL PRECEDENTS IN DISPUTES OF MATRIMONY ESTABLISHED A BRUTE AN UNNATURAL HUSBAND AN INSULTING CREATURE A BASE IMITATION OF A MAN AND VARIOUS OTHER AGREEABLE CHARACTERS TOO NUMEROUS FOR RECITAL
AND SURVEYED WITH EQUAL PLEASURE BESIDES RINGS BROOCHES BRACELETS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF JEWELLERY OF SUCH MAGNIFICENT MATERIALS AND COSTLY WORKMANSHIP THAT OLIVER HAD NO IDEA EVEN OF THEIR NAMES HAVING REPLACED THESE TRINKETS
AND AT NIGHT MISSUS SOWERBERRY AFTER MAKING VARIOUS REMARKS OUTSIDE THE DOOR BY NO MEANS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MOTHER
AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS
AND HAPPY I HOPE SO REPLIED THE CHILD
AND RENDERED MISTER BUMBLE'S SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF THE PAROCHIAL CANE RATHER UNNECESSARY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE BACK KITCHEN IN COMPANY WITH A PUMP AND A SLICE OF BREAD
SAT HIMSELF DOWN UPON A BENCH TO WAIT FOR MORNING WITH THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED THROUGH THE CREVICES IN THE SHUTTERS OLIVER AROSE AND AGAIN UNBARRED THE DOOR ONE TIMID LOOK AROUND
SAID THE PLAYFUL OLD GENTLEMAN PATTING OLIVER ON THE HEAD APPROVINGLY I NEVER SAW A SHARPER LAD HERE'S A SHILLING FOR YOU
HE IMPARTED ADDITIONAL EFFECT THEREUNTO BY BEWAILING HIS DREADFUL WOUNDS TEN TIMES LOUDER THAN BEFORE AND WHEN HE OBSERVED A GENTLEMAN IN A WHITE WAISTCOAT CROSSING THE YARD HE WAS MORE TRAGIC IN HIS LAMENTATIONS THAN EVER
THERE IS A DROWSY STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING WHEN YOU DREAM MORE IN FIVE MINUTES WITH YOUR EYES HALF OPEN
THIS FLOOD OF TEARS LEFT MISTER SOWERBERRY NO ALTERNATIVE IF HE HAD HESITATED FOR ONE INSTANT TO PUNISH OLIVER MOST SEVERELY IT MUST BE QUITE CLEAR TO EVERY EXPERIENCED READER THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
A NOTE CASE IN THE OTHER AND A WATCH IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET WITH A GUARD CHAIN ROUND HIS NECK AND STICKING A MOCK DIAMOND PIN IN HIS SHIRT BUTTONED HIS COAT TIGHT ROUND HIM AND PUTTING HIS SPECTACLE CASE AND HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POCKETS
FOR THE BRIEFEST SPACE OF TIME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE CONCEIVED IT WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD BEEN OBSERVED HE CLOSED THE LID OF THE BOX WITH A LOUD CRASH AND LAYING HIS HAND ON A BREAD KNIFE WHICH WAS ON THE TABLE STARTED FURIOUSLY UP
HE HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TAUNTS WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT HE HAD BORNE THE LASH WITHOUT A CRY FOR HE FELT THAT PRIDE SWELLING IN HIS HEART WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT DOWN A SHRIEK TO THE LAST
BUT VERY NEAT AND NICELY MADE INGENIOUS WORKMAN AIN'T HE OLIVER VERY INDEED SIR SAID OLIVER AT WHICH MISTER CHARLES BATES LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY
ALL THIS TIME THE TWO BOYS FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT GETTING OUT OF HIS SIGHT SO NIMBLY EVERY TIME HE TURNED ROUND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THEIR MOTIONS
IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID OLIVER
REPLIED THE BEADLE AND THE COCKED HAT AND CANE HAVING BEEN BY THIS TIME ADJUSTED TO THEIR OWNER'S SATISFACTION MISTER BUMBLE AND NOAH CLAYPOLE BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH ALL SPEED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S SHOP
FOR IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE REPLIES OF THE TWO BOYS THAT THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THERE AND OLIVER NATURALLY WONDERED HOW THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND TIME TO BE SO VERY INDUSTRIOUS
NOT BEFORE I KNOW THE DOCTOR MUST BE RIGHT OLIVER BECAUSE I DREAM SO MUCH OF HEAVEN AND ANGELS AND KIND FACES THAT I NEVER SEE WHEN I AM AWAKE KISS ME SAID THE CHILD
CLIMBING UP THE LOW GATE AND FLINGING HIS LITTLE ARMS ROUND OLIVER'S NECK GOOD B'YE DEAR GOD BLESS YOU THE BLESSING WAS FROM A YOUNG CHILD'S LIPS
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT MY DEAR I ONLY TRIED TO FRIGHTEN YOU
EXCITABLE NATURES MISSUS SOWERBERRY
FOR DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DODGER AND CHARLEY AND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES WENT AWAY TOGETHER HAVING BEEN KINDLY FURNISHED BY THE AMIABLE OLD JEW WITH MONEY TO SPEND THERE MY DEAR SAID FAGIN THAT'S A PLEASANT LIFE ISN'T IT
FROM BEING SO STILL HE SOFTLY RECLOSED THE DOOR HAVING AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE EXPIRING LIGHT OF THE CANDLE TO TIE UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF THE FEW ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL HE HAD
GIVING OLIVER A SHAKE AND A BOX ON THE EAR HE CALLED MY MOTHER NAMES
THE FOLKS CALL ME A MISER MY DEAR ONLY A MISER THAT'S ALL OLIVER THOUGHT THE OLD GENTLEMAN MUST BE A DECIDED MISER TO LIVE IN SUCH A DIRTY PLACE WITH SO MANY WATCHES
HE DID NOT ANSWER AND WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES ASLEEP AFTER SATISFYING HIMSELF UPON THIS HEAD THE JEW STEPPED GENTLY TO THE DOOR
THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ITS INMATES STIRRING AT THAT EARLY HOUR OLIVER STOPPED AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN A CHILD WAS WEEDING ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS AS HE STOPPED HE RAISED HIS PALE FACE
BUT ALARMED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE RUSHED INTO THE YARD WITHOUT HIS COCKED HAT
SAID THE JEW VERY MUCH INDEED IF YOU'LL TEACH ME SIR REPLIED OLIVER MASTER BATES SAW SOMETHING SO EXQUISITELY LUDICROUS IN THIS REPLY THAT HE BURST INTO ANOTHER LAUGH
AND TAKE THEIR ADVICE IN ALL MATTERS ESPECIALLY THE DODGER'S MY DEAR HE'LL BE A GREAT MAN HIMSELF AND WILL MAKE YOU ONE TOO IF YOU TAKE PATTERN BY HIM IS MY HANDKERCHIEF HANGING OUT OF MY POCKET MY DEAR
REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN STAY THERE'S A PITCHER OF WATER IN THE CORNER BY THE DOOR BRING IT HERE AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BASIN TO WASH IN MY DEAR OLIVER GOT UP WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND STOOPED FOR AN INSTANT TO RAISE THE PITCHER
SHE DESERVED WHAT HE SAID AND WORSE SHE DIDN'T SAID OLIVER SHE DID SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY IT'S A LIE SAID OLIVER MISSUS SOWERBERRY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
AT THIS POINT OF MISTER BUMBLE'S DISCOURSE OLIVER JUST HEARING ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SOME ALLUSION WAS BEING MADE TO HIS MOTHER RECOMMENCED KICKING WITH A VIOLENCE THAT RENDERED EVERY OTHER SOUND INAUDIBLE SOWERBERRY RETURNED AT THIS JUNCTURE
SAID FAGIN TO CHARLEY BATES WIPES REPLIED MASTER BATES AT THE SAME TIME PRODUCING FOUR POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
AND INQUIRED WHAT THAT YOUNG CUR WAS HOWLING FOR AND WHY MISTER BUMBLE DID NOT FAVOUR HIM WITH SOMETHING WHICH WOULD RENDER THE SERIES OF VOCULAR EXCLAMATIONS SO DESIGNATED AN INVOLUNTARY PROCESS
AT LAST THE DODGER TROD UPON HIS TOES OR RAN UPON HIS BOOT ACCIDENTLY WHILE CHARLEY BATES STUMBLED UP AGAINST HIM BEHIND AND IN THAT ONE MOMENT THEY TOOK FROM HIM WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY
SAID MISTER BUMBLE WITH A FACE OF ASHY PALENESS AND HIS MISSIS INTERPOSED MISTER CLAYPOLE AND HIS MASTER TOO I THINK YOU SAID NOAH ADDED MISTER BUMBLE NO
AND SPIRIT IN HIM MA'AM UNBECOMING A PERSON OF HIS CONDITION
NO NO NO FINE FELLOWS FINE FELLOWS WITH THESE AND OTHER MUTTERED REFLECTIONS OF THE LIKE NATURE THE JEW ONCE MORE DEPOSITED THE WATCH IN ITS PLACE OF SAFETY AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN MORE WERE SEVERALLY DRAWN FORTH FROM THE SAME BOX
AS THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE VISITORS STOPPED A LONG TIME SPIRITS WERE PRODUCED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES COMPLAINING OF A COLDNESS IN HER INSIDE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A VERY CONVIVIAL AND IMPROVING TURN
ORDERED HIM UPSTAIRS TO HIS DISMAL BED IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SILENCE AND STILLNESS OF THE GLOOMY WORKSHOP OF THE UNDERTAKER THAT OLIVER GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS WHICH THE DAY'S TREATMENT
THE STARS SEEMED TO THE BOY'S EYES FARTHER FROM THE EARTH THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE SOMBRE SHADOWS THROWN BY THE TREES UPON THE GROUND
WHEN THIS GAME HAD BEEN PLAYED A GREAT MANY TIMES A COUPLE OF YOUNG LADIES CALLED TO SEE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF WHOM WAS NAMED BET AND THE OTHER NANCY THEY WORE A GOOD DEAL OF HAIR NOT VERY NEATLY TURNED UP BEHIND AND WERE RATHER UNTIDY ABOUT THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS
AND YET THE SELF SAME SENSES WERE MENTALLY ENGAGED
HUSH DICK SAID OLIVER AS THE BOY RAN TO THE GATE AND THRUST HIS THIN ARM BETWEEN THE RAILS TO GREET HIM IS ANY ONE UP NOBODY BUT ME REPLIED THE CHILD YOU MUSN'T SAY YOU SAW ME DICK SAID OLIVER I AM RUNNING AWAY
AND EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY TENDING TO COMPROMISE TELLSON'S MISTER LORRY ADVISED WITH LUCIE SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIRING A LODGING FOR A SHORT TERM IN THAT QUARTER NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
ONE IS DISPOSED TO ALLEGE THAT CHANCE RATHER THAN ANY HUMAN WILL GUIDED BY REASON MUST HAVE LED TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND IF WE CONSIDER THAT NEVERTHELESS THERE HAVE BEEN AT ALL TIMES CERTAIN OFFICERS
UPON WHICH DIFFERENT HANDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS IN THOSE COMPLETED BY A SINGLE MASTER THUS IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE BUILDINGS WHICH A SINGLE ARCHITECT HAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED
PROBABLE REASONINGS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS COMPOSED AS THEY ARE OF THE OPINIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MASSED TOGETHER ARE FARTHER REMOVED FROM TRUTH THAN THE SIMPLE INFERENCES WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SENSE
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
WHO HAD BEEN UNEASILY BITING HIS THUMB NAIL AND LOOKING AT HER COLLECTED HIS FACE INTO A STERNER EXPRESSION WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR HUSBAND SAYS IN THAT LITTLE LETTER
JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT THE VENGEANCE FOLLOWED
PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
I STATE THE CASE CITIZEN DEFARGE
WITH DARK CURLING HAIR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP
MAY OFTEN EQUAL OR SURPASS IN BEAUTY THOSE OF THE LATTER YET WHEN ONE OBSERVES THEIR INDISCRIMINATE JUXTAPOSITION
THE PARTICULAR SCIENCES COMMONLY DENOMINATED MATHEMATICS BUT OBSERVING THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR OBJECTS THEY ALL AGREE IN CONSIDERING ONLY THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OR PROPORTIONS
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
EITHER INJURIOUS OR SUPERFLUOUS MINGLED WITH THE FORMER THAT IT IS ALMOST QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A SEVERANCE OF THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE AS IT IS TO EXTRACT A DIANA OR A MINERVA FROM A ROUGH BLOCK OF MARBLE
WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
IN THE SAME WAY I THOUGHT THAT THE SCIENCES CONTAINED IN BOOKS
BUT TO USE IT IN HIS BEHALF O SISTER WOMAN THINK OF ME AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
AND IN POINT OF FACT THE ACCURATE OBSERVANCE OF THESE FEW PRECEPTS GAVE ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SUCH EASE IN UNRAVELING ALL THE QUESTIONS EMBRACED IN THESE TWO SCIENCES
ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET
AND ONE IN WHICH PRECIPITANCY AND ANTICIPATION IN JUDGMENT WERE MOST TO BE DREADED I THOUGHT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO APPROACH IT TILL I HAD REACHED A MORE MATURE AGE BEING AT THAT TIME BUT TWENTY THREE
AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
LITTLE THINKING WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING NEAR HIM IN THE NIGHT AND MIGHT BUT FOR A CHANCE HAVE DONE TO HIM DEAREST TAKE COURAGE I AM WELL AND YOUR FATHER HAS INFLUENCE AROUND ME YOU CANNOT ANSWER THIS
THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS OF ARITHMETIC AND HAS MADE A PARTICULAR ADDITION ACCORDING TO RULE
AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
TURNING TO HER FRIEND THE VENGEANCE THE WIVES AND MOTHERS WE HAVE BEEN USED TO SEE SINCE WE WERE AS LITTLE AS THIS CHILD AND MUCH LESS HAVE NOT BEEN GREATLY CONSIDERED
THAT WE CANNOT DISCOVER IT PROVIDED ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ACCEPTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ALWAYS PRESERVE IN OUR THOUGHTS THE ORDER NECESSARY FOR THE DEDUCTION OF ONE TRUTH FROM ANOTHER AND
BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER WHICH A PERSON BROUGHT UP FROM INFANCY IN FRANCE OR GERMANY EXHIBITS FROM THAT WHICH
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS AND OBSERVED IN ENGLISH
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
IT WORE ITSELF OUT AND WORE HIM OUT WITH IT UNTIL THE BANK CLOSED HE WAS AGAIN ALONE IN HIS ROOM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT WHEN HE HEARD A FOOT UPON THE STAIR
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
OF THESE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT THERE IS SELDOM SO MUCH PERFECTION IN WORKS COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE PARTS
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
INFLUENCE HE SAYS SOMETHING TOUCHING INFLUENCE
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
A SHADOW INDEED NO SUBSTANCE IN IT LUCIE BUT THE SHADOW OF THE MANNER OF THESE DEFARGES WAS DARK UPON HIMSELF FOR ALL THAT
SHE STOPPED IN THE ACT OF PUTTING THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM AND WITH HER HANDS YET AT HER NECK LOOKED TERRIFIED AT MADAME DEFARGE
AND RIDICULOUS I WAS THUS LED TO INFER THAT THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS IS FAR MORE CUSTOM AND EXAMPLE THAN ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH SUCH BE THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
FOR ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THIS UNDERTAKING THESE WERE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT REMEDY NOR ONCE TO BE COMPARED WITH SUCH AS ATTEND THE SLIGHTEST REFORMATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS LARGE BODIES
AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
NOT PHYSIOGNOMY ALONE NOR BRAIN ALONE IS WORTHY FOR THE MUSE I SAY THE FORM COMPLETE IS WORTHIER FAR THE FEMALE EQUALLY WITH THE MALE I SING NOR CEASE AT THE THEME OF ONE'S SELF

WHAT NONSENSE SAID BACON THE ONLY PLAYS OF YOURS I WROTE WERE HAM SH SAID SHAKESPEARE SHAKING HIS HEAD MADLY HUSH NOBODY'S SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THIS IS PURELY A DISCUSSION OF OTHELLO
JUST TO SHOW THE FATES THAT HE DIDN'T CARE A TUPPENCE FOR THEIR VERDICT AS REGISTERED THROUGH THE OBOLUS IT WAS A PECULIAR CUSTOM OF SHAKESPEARE'S TO TOSS UP A COIN TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND THEN DO THE THING THE COIN DECIDED HE SHOULD NOT DO
A FRIGHTFUL SEASON WINTER CHANGES THE WATER OF HEAVEN AND THE HEART OF MAN INTO A STONE HER CREDITORS HARRASSED HER FANTINE EARNED TOO LITTLE HER DEBTS HAD INCREASED
CHAPTER TEN RESULT OF THE SUCCESS SHE HAD BEEN DISMISSED TOWARDS THE END OF THE WINTER THE SUMMER PASSED BUT WINTER CAME AGAIN SHORT DAYS LESS WORK WINTER NO WARMTH NO LIGHT
OTHERWISE HE WOULD TURN LITTLE COSETTE OUT OF DOORS CONVALESCENT AS SHE WAS FROM HER HEAVY ILLNESS INTO THE COLD AND THE STREETS AND THAT SHE MIGHT DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH HERSELF AND DIE IF SHE CHOSE
I'VE MURDERED EVERYTHING BUT ENGLISH THOUGH I COULD HAVE MADE A FINE TRAGEDY OUT OF YOU SAID SHAKESPEARE JUST THINK WHAT A DREADFUL CLIMAX FOR A TRAGEDY IT WOULD BE JOHNSON TO HAVE NERO AS THE CURTAIN FELL PLAYING A VIOLIN SOLO
SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HE'D HAVE MADE A SUPERB TRAGEDY NERO WOULD I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY KIND OF A CRIME HE LEFT UNCOMMITTED WAS THERE EMPEROR YES I NEVER WROTE AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY RETURNED THE EMPEROR DRYLY
AND THERE STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ON THE POOL TABLE WAS ROBERT BURNS TRYING TO WRITE A SONNET ON THE CLOTH WITH CHALK IN LESS TIME THAN VILLON COULD TURN OUT ANOTHER WITH TWO LINES START ON THE BILLIARD TABLE WITH THE SAME WRITING MATERIALS
THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I THINK YOUR PARALLELS ARE VERY PARALLEL A SHOEMAKER MY DEAR CONFUCIUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A POET CERTAINLY SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONUNDRUM OF THE QUESTION
IF WE PUT OUT THE POET TO PLEASE THE SAGE WE'LL SOON HAVE TO PUT OUT THE SAGE TO PLEASE THE FOOL AND SO ON WE'LL KEEP IT UP ONCE THE PRECEDENT IS ESTABLISHED
NO SAID THE SHADE OF EMERSON WHICH HAD STROLLED IN WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS TALKING THAT ISN'T CRITICISM THAT'S BOSTON WHO DISCOVERED BOSTON ANYHOW ASKED DOCTOR JOHNSON IT WASN'T COLUMBUS WAS IT
NOW I ASK YOU GENTLEMEN IF THESE THINGS ARE TO BE TOLERATED ARE THEY NOT RATHER TO BE REPREHENDED WHETHER I AM A CHINAMAN OR NOT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO THEN ASKED SIR WALTER RALEIGH A LITTLE NETTLED
FANTINE RETURNED HOME SHE WAS FURIOUS AND RELATED THE OCCURRENCE TO HER GOOD NEIGHBOR MARGUERITE CAN YOU UNDERSTAND SUCH A THING IS HE NOT AN ABOMINABLE MAN HOW CAN THEY ALLOW SUCH PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY
LORD THE CANDLE IS ALL BURNED OUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THEN SHE LOOKED AT FANTINE
THEY DEMAND FORTY FRANCS OF ME SO MUCH FOR YOU YOU PEASANTS
SHE RECEIVED THE LETTER AND CRUSHED IT IN HER HANDS ALL DAY LONG THAT EVENING SHE WENT INTO A BARBER'S SHOP AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND PULLED OUT HER COMB HER ADMIRABLE GOLDEN HAIR FELL TO HER KNEES
TURN THE LIBRARY SOFAS INTO BENCHES AND GO PEGGING AWAY AT BOOT MAKING SO WHY SHOULD YOU LET THE POETS TURN THE PLACE INTO A VERSE FACTORY THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN SAID BLACKSTONE
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL AND BEGAN HER WORK AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE LEFT HER SEWING
AND SHE HAD A BLACK HOLE IN HER MOUTH THE TWO TEETH HAD BEEN EXTRACTED
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY SAID NERO GRINNING BROADLY YOU ARE A BRIGHT SPIRIT SAID SHAKESPEARE WITH A SIGH I WISH I HAD THOUGHT TO WORK YOU UP INTO A TRAGEDY I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHY YOU DIDN'T
PRETTY GOOD RETURNED THE DOCTOR BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF KILLING OFF YOUR AUDIENCE THAT WAY IT'S BETTER BUSINESS TO LET EM LIVE I SAY SUPPOSE NERO GAVE A LONDON AUDIENCE THAT LITTLE MUSICALE HE PROVIDED AT QUEEN ELIZABETH'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT
SHE DEEPLY HATED FATHER MADELEINE BUT MADE NO COMPLAINT SHE SEWED SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY BUT A CONTRACTOR FOR THE WORK OF PRISONS WHO MADE THE PRISONERS WORK AT A DISCOUNT SUDDENLY MADE PRICES FALL
AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST SIGHT THAT GREETED OUR EYES I GIVE IT UP SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CATACORNERED SIGHT WHATEVER IT WAS IF THE EMPEROR'S EYES SLANTED LIKE YOURS
DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO MAKE A PAIR OF SHOES RETORTED DEMOSTHENES SWALLOWING A PEBBLE IN HIS HASTE THEY'VE GOT A RIGHT TO THE STATIONERY THOUGH PUT IN BLACKSTONE A CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT TO IT
THAT POETS MUST NOT BE INSPIRED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN A M AND FIVE P M OR IN THE EVENING AFTER EIGHT THAT ANY POET DISCOVERED USING MORE THAN FIVE ARM CHAIRS IN THE COMPOSITION OF A QUATRAIN WILL BE CHARGED TWO OBOLI AN HOUR FOR EACH CHAIR IN EXCESS OF THAT NUMBER
AND IT RELUCTANTLY TOOK THE SUBJECT IN HAND AT AN EARLY MEETING I FIND HERE SAID DEMOSTHENES TO THE CHAIRMAN AS THE COMMITTEE GATHERED A SUGGESTION FROM HOMER AND SAMSON THAT THIS HOUSE BOAT BE PROVIDED WITH A POETS CORNER
WE DO NOT BIND OURSELVES TO YIELD TO DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND SHOEMAKERS AND PLUMBERS IN CASE THEY SHOULD EACH WANT A CORNER TO THEMSELVES A VERY WISE IDEA SAID SIR WALTER WHEREUPON THE RESOLUTION WAS SUITABLY WORDED AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF HIS FIDDLINGS THAT SENT NATURE INTO CONVULSIONS AND CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII SO THERE PUT THAT ON YOUR MUSIC RACK AND FIDDLE IT MY LITTLE EMPEROR NERO'S FACE GREW PURPLE WITH ANGER
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE VINGT ET UN AND OTHER PLAYERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE WOOERS OF THE MUSE I'LL VOTE TO HAVE THE POETS CORNER AND IN IT I MOVE THAT CASSIUS'S SLATE IDEA BE CARRIED OUT IT WILL BE A GREAT SAVING
AND WHEN I VENTURED TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM HE LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID I'D SPOILED THE WHOLE SECOND VOLUME OF THE RUBAIYAT I TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO DO HIS RUBAIYATTING AT HOME AND HE MADE A SCENE TO AVOID WHICH I HASTENED WITH MY GUEST OVER TO THE BILLIARD ROOM
HULLO WILLIAM SAID THE DOCTOR POCKETING THREE BALLS ON THE BREAK HOW'S OUR LITTLE SWANLET OF AVON THIS AFTERNOON WORN OUT SHAKESPEARE REPLIED I'VE BEEN HARD AT WORK ON A PLAY THIS MORNING AND I'M TIRED
IT SHOWED IN SHAKESPEARE'S ESTIMATION HIS ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE OF THOSE DULL PERSONS WHO SUPPOSED THAT IN THEM WAS CENTRED THE DESTINY OF ALL MANKIND THE FATES HOWEVER ONLY SMILED AT THESE LITTLE ACTS OF REBELLION
LORD BACON ACCOMPANIED BY CHARON AND THE ICE FOR NERO AND THE ALE FOR DOCTOR JOHNSON APPEARED AS SHAKESPEARE SPOKE THE PHILOSOPHER BOWED STIFFLY AT DOCTOR JOHNSON AS THOUGH HE HARDLY APPROVED OF HIM EXTENDED HIS LEFT HAND TO SHAKESPEARE
SO THAT UNWITTINGLY THE GREAT DRAMATIST DID THEIR WILL AFTER ALL IT WAS A PART OF THEIR PLAN THAT UPON THIS OCCASION SHAKESPEARE SHOULD PLAY POOL WITH DOCTOR JOHNSON AND THE EMPEROR NERO
OH NO SAID EMERSON OLD GOVERNOR WINTHROP IS TO BLAME FOR THAT WHEN HE SETTLED AT CHARLESTOWN HE SAW THE OLD INDIAN TOWN OF SHAWMUT ACROSS THE CHARLES AND SHAWMUT WAS THE BOSTON MICROBE WAS IT ASKED JOHNSON YES
SAID EMERSON SPELT WITH A P I SUPPOSE SAID SHAKESPEARE P S H A W PSHAW M U T MUT PSHAWMUT SO CALLED BECAUSE THE INHABITANTS ARE ALWAYS MUTTERING PSHAW EH PRETTY GOOD SAID JOHNSON
IF WE COULD HAVE HAD POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DAY I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TO FALL ON MY SWORD TO GET OUT OF KEEPING AN ENGAGEMENT I HAD NO FANCY FOR CLASS CLUBS HAVE THEIR USES NO DOUBT SAID DEMOSTHENES
SHE FOUND THEM IN THE STREET SHE FOUND THEM AGAIN ON HER STAIRCASE SHE PASSED MANY A NIGHT WEEPING AND THINKING HER EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT AND SHE FELT A STEADY PAIN IN HER SHOULDER TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE LEFT SHOULDER BLADE SHE COUGHED A GREAT DEAL
ONE OF THOSE ATTICS WHOSE EXTREMITY FORMS AN ANGLE WITH THE FLOOR AND KNOCKS YOU ON THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT THE POOR OCCUPANT CAN REACH THE END OF HIS CHAMBER AS HE CAN THE END OF HIS DESTINY ONLY BY BENDING OVER MORE AND MORE SHE HAD NO LONGER A BED
AND IT WAS COMMON GOSSIP IN EREBUS THAT ONE OF THE TRIO HAD TOLD THE FURIES THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED SHAKESPEARE'S TENDENCY TO KICK OVER THE TRACES AND ALWAYS ACTED ACCORDINGLY THEY NEVER LET THE COIN FALL SO AS TO DECIDE A QUESTION THE WAY THEY WANTED IT
SHE AFFECTED TO LAUGH AND SING AN OLD WORKWOMAN WHO ONCE SAW HER LAUGHING AND SINGING IN THIS FASHION SAID THERE'S A GIRL WHO WILL COME TO A BAD END SHE TOOK A LOVER THE FIRST WHO OFFERED A MAN WHOM SHE DID NOT LOVE
FANTINE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO READ HER LETTER ONCE MORE ON THE STAIRCASE THAT EVENING SHE WENT OUT AND WAS SEEN TO TURN HER STEPS IN THE DIRECTION
YOU PRESENT TO MY MIND A CLOSER RESEMBLANCE TO SIMPLE SIMON THAN TO SOCRATES FOR MY PART I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID WRITE IT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKESPEARE DID I CAN TELL THAT BY THE SPELLING IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION
THE FIDDLING EX EMPEROR NERO SAID BACON LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM IS MISTAKEN WHEN HE ATTRIBUTES OTHELLO TO ME AHA MASTER NERO CRIED SHAKESPEARE TRIUMPHANTLY WHAT DID I TELL YOU
SHE BEGAN TO HATE EVERY ONE ABOUT HER SHE HAD LONG SHARED THE UNIVERSAL VENERATION FOR FATHER MADELEINE YET BY DINT OF REPEATING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DISCHARGED HER THAT HE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER UNHAPPINESS SHE CAME TO HATE HIM ALSO AND MOST OF ALL
THE LOWER SHE DESCENDED THE DARKER EVERYTHING GREW ABOUT HER THE MORE RADIANT SHONE THAT LITTLE ANGEL AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART SHE SAID WHEN I GET RICH I WILL HAVE MY COSETTE WITH ME AND SHE LAUGHED
THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE PERPENDICULAR WRINKLES SHE PATCHED HER BODICE WHICH WAS OLD AND WORN OUT WITH SCRAPS OF CALICO WHICH TORE AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SHE WAS INDEBTED MADE SCENES AND GAVE HER NO PEACE
THE IDEA THAT MAKES TWO NAPOLEONS WHERE DO THEY THINK I AM TO GET THEM THESE PEASANTS ARE STUPID TRULY NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT TO A DORMER WINDOW IN THE STAIRCASE AND READ THE LETTER ONCE MORE
FANTINE HAD GROWN TEN YEARS OLDER SINCE THE PRECEDING NIGHT JESUS SAID MARGUERITE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU FANTINE NOTHING REPLIED FANTINE QUITE THE CONTRARY
I FANCY WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO TAKE THE MATTER UP SAID BLACKSTONE WEARILY THOUGH I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PRECEDENT FOR SUCH ACTION
SHE PUT ON LITTLE ROUND CAPS WHICH CONCEALED HER SHORN HEAD AND IN WHICH SHE WAS STILL PRETTY DARK THOUGHTS HELD POSSESSION OF FANTINE'S HEART WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER DRESS HER HAIR
I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS IDIOTIC TALK ABOUT NOT HAVING WRITTEN MY OWN WORKS THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT NERO'S MUSIC THAT I'VE NEVER SAID BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WANTED TO HURT HIS FEELINGS BUT SINCE HE HAS CHOSEN TO CAST ASPERSIONS UPON MY HONESTY I HAVEN'T ANY HESITATION IN SAYING IT NOW
I AS A POET WOULD NOT OBJECT TO THAT I DO ALL MY WORK AT HOME ANYHOW THERE'S ANOTHER PHASE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED YET AND IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT SAID DEMOSTHENES
WHICH REDUCED THE DAILY EARNINGS OF WORKING WOMEN TO NINE SOUS SEVENTEEN HOURS OF TOIL AND NINE SOUS A DAY HER CREDITORS WERE MORE PITILESS THAN EVER THE SECOND HAND DEALER
SHAKESPEARE WAS MY STENOGRAPHER GENTLEMEN SAID LORD BACON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH HE DID WRITE HAMLET LITERALLY BUT IT WAS AT MY DICTATION I DENY IT SAID SHAKESPEARE
AND SAMSON WAS WISE IN BACKING IT UP THE POETS NEED TO BE CONCENTRATED SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WHERE OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO THEM HOMER OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE TO COMPOSE IN WHERE THE VINGT ET UN PLAYERS WILL NOT INTERRUPT HIS FRENZIES
OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WAY WE OUGHT TO GO WE'LL NEVER GET ASHORE AT THIS RATE SAID I IF IT'S THE ONLY COURSE THAT WE CAN LIE SIR WE MUST EVEN LIE IT
AND SIX MICE BUILT A LITTLE HEARSE TO CARRY HER TO HER GRAVE AND WHEN IT WAS READY THEY HARNESSED THEMSELVES BEFORE IT AND CHANTICLEER DROVE THEM ON THE WAY THEY MET THE FOX
CUT IT IN SMALL PIECES BRUISE IT TILL TENDER PUT IT IN A WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE AND CORK IT TIGHT
BELOW THE CLUSTERING TREES THE GIG WAS NO LONGER TO BE FEARED THE LITTLE POINT HAD ALREADY CONCEALED IT FROM OUR EYES THE EBB TIDE WHICH HAD SO CRUELLY DELAYED US
SO WORDS AND TEARS WERE OF NO AVAIL THE PARSON WAS SENT FOR AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE FIDDLER WHEN THIS WAS OVER THE KING SAID NOW GET READY TO GO YOU MUST NOT STAY HERE
THEY HAD ALL BEEN THINE AH UNLUCKY WRETCH THAT I AM SAID SHE WOULD THAT I HAD MARRIED KING GRISLY BEARD THEN THEY CAME TO A GREAT CITY
BUT IT MADE HER FINGERS VERY SORE I SEE THIS WORK WON'T DO SAID HE TRY AND SPIN PERHAPS YOU WILL DO THAT BETTER SO SHE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO SPIN
LET IT STAND COVERED BY THE FIRE A FEW MINUTES WHEN YOU CAN PUT IN SUGAR AND CREAM BLACK TEA BLACK TEA IS MUCH MORE SUITABLE THAN GREEN FOR SICK PERSONS AS IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE NERVES
PARTLET AND HAVING DUG A GRAVE FOR HER HE LAID HER IN IT AND MADE A LITTLE HILLOCK OVER HER THEN HE SAT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND WEPT AND MOURNED TILL AT LAST HE DIED TOO
SEVERAL TIMES WE SHIPPED A LITTLE WATER AND MY BREECHES AND THE TAILS OF MY COAT WERE ALL SOAKING WET BEFORE WE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS THE CAPTAIN MADE US TRIM THE BOAT
NOW PARTLET FOUND A VERY LARGE NUT BUT SHE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO CHANTICLEER AND KEPT IT ALL TO HERSELF
THE PIN STUCK HIMSELF INTO THE BED PILLOW THE MILLSTONE LAID HIMSELF OVER THE HOUSE DOOR AND THE EGG ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN THE TOWEL WHEN MISTER KORBES CAME HOME HE WENT TO THE FIREPLACE TO MAKE A FIRE
AND THE DUCK SEEMED MUCH TIRED AND WADDLED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
THEN SHE WAS IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND CRIED OUT TO CHANTICLEER
RETURNED THE CAPTAIN WE MUST KEEP UPSTREAM YOU SEE SIR HE WENT ON IF ONCE WE DROPPED TO LEEWARD OF THE LANDING PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE WE SHOULD GET ASHORE
PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH A QUART OF NEW MILK
MISTER TRELAWNEY WILL YOU PLEASE PICK ME OFF ONE OF THESE MEN SIR HANDS IF POSSIBLE SAID THE CAPTAIN
BUT DO NOT LET IT BURN PUT IT IN A PITCHER AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT TOAST WATER WILL ALLAY THIRST BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY THING ELSE IF IT IS WANTED TO DRINK THROUGH THE NIGHT IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE EARLY IN THE EVENING
AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THE OTHER PIRATES TROOPING OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES AND TUMBLING INTO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS
WITH ALL MY HEART GET UP BEHIND AND BE SURE YOU DO NOT FALL OFF TAKE CARE OF THIS HANDSOME COACH OF MINE NOR DIRTY MY PRETTY RED WHEELS SO FINE NOW MICE BE READY AND WHEELS RUN STEADY FOR WE ARE GOING A VISIT TO PAY
ANOTHER DAY
ALAS SIGHED SHE
I'LL TRY AND SET UP A TRADE IN POTS AND PANS
IT IS A COOLING DRINK IN FEVERS IF THE WEATHER IS COLD YOU CAN MAKE A LARGER QUANTITY SOME BOIL WHOLE RAISINS WITH BARLEY TAKE IT WITH OR WITHOUT SEASONING TO POACH EGGS
ON OUR FEET THE OTHER THREE TOOK COMPLETE HEADERS AND CAME UP AGAIN DRENCHED AND BUBBLING SO FAR THERE WAS NO GREAT HARM NO LIVES WERE LOST
THEN WARM IT AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT
HAVE A CLEAN SKILLET WITH A PINT OF BOILING WATER IN IT STIR IT IN AND WHEN DONE SEASON IT WITH SALT TO YOUR TASTE
AND PUT IN A SPOONFUL OF BUTTER TOAST A SLICE OF BREAD AND MOISTEN IT WITH WATER THEN POUR ON THE BOILING MILK THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR SICK PERSONS AND CAN BE EATEN WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION
ALL HANDS STAND BY TO TRIM HER WHEN HE AIMS THE SQUIRE RAISED HIS GUN THE ROWING CEASED
AND CHANTICLEER REPLIED ALL ON OUR WAY A VISIT TO PAY TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY THEN THE CAT SAID TAKE ME WITH YOU CHANTICLEER SAID
BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY MEANT NOTHING SHOULD DELAY THEIR SHOT THEY HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED AT THEIR FALLEN COMRADE THOUGH HE WAS NOT DEAD
I AM THE FIDDLER WHO HAS LIVED WITH YOU IN THE HUT I BROUGHT YOU THERE BECAUSE I REALLY LOVED YOU I AM ALSO THE SOLDIER THAT OVERSET YOUR STALL
GIVE WAY THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE MUSTN'T MIND IF WE SWAMP HER NOW IF WE CAN'T GET ASHORE ALL'S UP ONLY ONE OF THE GIGS IS BEING MANNED SIR
AND SEASON IT WITH WINE OR LEMON JUICE TAPIOCA JELLY WASH THE TAPIOCA WELL AND LET IT SOAK FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN COLD WATER PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH THE SAME WATER AND LET IT BOIL SLOWLY TILL IT IS CLEAR AND THICK
YOU HAVE LEARNT WISDOM AND IT IS TIME TO HOLD OUR MARRIAGE FEAST THEN THE CHAMBERLAINS CAME AND BROUGHT HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROBES AND HER FATHER AND HIS WHOLE COURT WERE THERE ALREADY
WHEN YOU SEE THE MATCH AND WE'LL HOLD WATER IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAD BEEN MAKING HEADWAY AT A GOOD PACE FOR A BOAT SO OVERLOADED AND WE HAD SHIPPED
AS STANDING IN THE TIN POT SPOILS THE FLAVOR PUT TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF GROUND COFFEE IN A SMALL MUG AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT LET IT SET BY THE FIRE TO SETTLE AND POUR IT OFF IN A CUP WITH SUGAR AND CREAM
TO ADD TO OUR CONCERN
HAD BEEN AT A PUBLIC HOUSE A FEW MILES OFF AND HAD SAT DRINKING TILL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN HOW LATE IT WAS HE BEGGED THEREFORE THAT THE TRAVELLERS WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO GIVE THEM A LIFT IN THEIR CARRIAGE
THE GUN SAID HE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID I FOR I MADE SURE HE WAS THINKING OF A BOMBARDMENT OF THE FORT THEY COULD NEVER GET THE GUN ASHORE
POUR IT IN A BOWL ON A SLICE OF TOAST CUT UP AND GRATE A LITTLE NUTMEG OVER PANADA PUT SOME CRACKERS CRUSTS OF DRY BREAD OR DRIED RUSK IN A SAUCE PAN WITH COLD WATER AND A FEW RAISINS
SEASON TO YOUR TASTE WITH WINE NUTMEG AND BUTTER OAT MEAL GRUEL
FOR WE HAD ALL QUIETLY MADE UP OUR MINDS TO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE OF OURSELVES SUDDENLY THE CAPTAIN SPOKE UP AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HIS VOICE WAS A LITTLE CHANGED
THEY BELONG TO KING GRISLY BEARD
MOISTEN TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF POWDERED ARROW ROOT WITH WATER AND RUB IT SMOOTH WITH A SPOON THEN POUR ON HALF A PINT OF BOILING WATER SEASON IT WITH LEMON JUICE OR WINE AND NUTMEG IN COOKING ARROW ROOT FOR CHILDREN
AND BROKE ALL HER GOODS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AH WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL MY HUSBAND SAY
ALL ON A SUDDEN AS SHE WAS GOING OUT IN CAME THE KING'S SON IN GOLDEN CLOTHES
BUT ON THE STEPS KING GRISLY BEARD OVERTOOK HER AND BROUGHT HER BACK AND SAID
WE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD DIRECT FOR THE LANDING PLACE BY THIS TIME WE HAD GOT SO FAR OUT OF THE RUN OF THE CURRENT THAT WE KEPT STEERAGE WAY EVEN AT OUR NECESSARILY GENTLE RATE OF ROWING
FOOD FOR THE SICK REMARKS ON PREPARING FOOD FOR THE SICK FEW YOUNG PERSONS UNDERSTAND COOKING FOR THE SICK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO PREPARE THEIR FOOD IN AN INVITING MANNER
AND STIR IN WHEN IT BOILS KEEP STIRRING IT FIVE MINUTES WHEN POUR IT IN A BOWL AND SEASON WITH SALT BARLEY WATER
CRYING NOW DUCK GET ON AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND AWAY THEY WENT AT A PRETTY GOOD PACE AFTER THEY HAD TRAVELLED ALONG A LITTLE WAY
BUT THE BRIDE SAID RUN FIRST AND BRING ME MY GARLAND THAT IS HANGING ON A WILLOW IN THE GARDEN
AND TO BRUSH ONE'S CLOTHES BUT NOT ENTIRELY FITTED FOR A MAN OF WAR WITH ALL THIS IN OUR MINDS WE WADED ASHORE AS FAST AS WE COULD LEAVING BEHIND US
IF YOU HAVE A SMALL CHICKEN IT WILL TAKE HALF OF IT TO MAKE A PINT OF CHICKEN WATER
CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT THERE ARE NO BURNT GRAINS CHOCOLATE TO MAKE A CUP OF CHOCOLATE GRATE A LARGE TEA SPOONFUL IN A MUG
CREAM TOAST CUT A SLICE OF STALE BREAD AND WET IT WITH CREAM TOAST IT SLOWLY AND BUTTER IT THIS IS VERY NICE FOR AN INVALID AND AN AGREEABLE CHANGE
WHILE THIS WAS PASSING A DUCK CAME QUACKING UP AND CRIED OUT YOU THIEVING VAGABONDS WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU IN MY GROUNDS I'LL GIVE IT YOU WELL FOR YOUR INSOLENCE
HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF
IF YOU PLEASE BEAR UP UNTIL YOU SEE YOU'RE GAINING I TRIED AND FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE TIDE KEPT SWEEPING US WESTWARD UNTIL I HAD LAID HER HEAD DUE EAST
TAMARINDS CURRANT OR GRAPE JELLY CRANBERRIES OR DRIED FRUIT OF ANY KIND MAKE A GOOD DRINK COFFEE SICK PERSONS SHOULD HAVE THEIR COFFEE MADE SEPARATE FROM THE FAMILY
THE BEAR THE GOAT AND ALL THE BEASTS OF THE WOOD CAME AND CLIMBED UPON THE HEARSE SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A RAPID STREAM HOW SHALL WE GET OVER SAID CHANTICLEER
AND THE NEEDLE CRIED OUT STOP STOP
YOU MUST TRAVEL ON WITH YOUR HUSBAND
CHANTICLEER RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE RIVER AND SAID RIVER GIVE ME SOME WATER FOR PARTLET LIES IN THE MOUNTAIN
I ADDED THE CREW OF THE OTHER MOST LIKELY GOING ROUND BY SHORE TO CUT US OFF THEY'LL HAVE A HOT RUN SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
AND WHEN NOBODY WAS STIRRING IN THE INN CHANTICLEER AWAKENED HIS WIFE AND FETCHING THE EGG THEY PECKED A HOLE IN IT ATE IT UP AND THREW THE SHELLS INTO THE FIREPLACE
WAS ALREADY MORE THAN SHE WAS MEANT TO CARRY ADD TO THAT THE POWDER PORK AND BREAD BAGS THE GUNWALE WAS LIPPING ASTERN
SOME HALF HOUR OF THIS WORK AND RIDERHOOD UNSHIPPED HIS SCULLS STOOD HOLDING ON TO A BARGE AND HAND OVER HAND LONG WISE ALONG THE BARGE'S SIDE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS BOAT UNDER HER HEAD INTO A SECRET LITTLE NOOK OF SCUMMY WATER
TO WHOM SHALL IT BE ADDRESSED MISTER BOFFIN ANYONE YOURSELF MISTER ROKESMITH QUICKLY WROTE AND THEN READ ALOUD MISTER BOFFIN PRESENTS HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH
HIS DIRECTIONS WERE OBEYED AND THEY PULLED ASHORE DIRECTLY TWO IN ONE BOAT TWO IN THE OTHER NOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AGAIN TO RIDERHOOD WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON THE SLUSHY STONES YOU HAVE HAD MORE PRACTICE IN THIS THAN I HAVE HAD
THE THREE WATCHERS LOOKED EACH AT THE BLANK FACES OF THE OTHER TWO
TWO NEW SERVANTS MISTER AND MISSUS BOFFIN SAT AFTER BREAKFAST IN THE BOWER A PREY TO PROSPERITY MISTER BOFFIN'S FACE DENOTED CARE AND COMPLICATION MANY DISORDERED PAPERS WERE BEFORE HIM
THE INFORMER WIPED HIS BROW RUEFULLY AS HE SAID IT SITTING IN HIS BOAT AND ALWAYS STARING DISCONSOLATE DID YOU MAKE HIS BOAT FAST SHE'S FAST ENOUGH TILL THE TIDE RUNS BACK I COULDN'T MAKE HER FASTER THAN SHE IS
SPEAK FATHER SPEAK TO US THE WINDS THE ONLY LISTENERS LEFT YOU NOW SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION KNEELING ON ONE KNEE BESIDE THE BODY WHEN THEY HAD STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON THE DROWNED MAN
THE OBJECT HE HAD EXPECTED TO TAKE IN TOW FLOATS BY AND HIS OWN BOAT TOWS HIM DEAD TO WHERE WE FOUND HIM ALL ENTANGLED IN HIS OWN LINE
COULD NOT EXACTLY SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM GO BUT HAD NOTICED THAT HE WAS RESTLESS SINGULAR AND ENTERTAINING COMBINATION SIR YOUR FRIEND
ADDED RIDERHOOD CREEPING AFT AND SHOWING A STRETCHED ROPE MADE FAST THERE AND TOWING OVERBOARD DIDN'T I TELL YOU HE WAS IN LUCK AGAIN HAUL IN SAID MISTER INSPECTOR EASY TO SAY HAUL IN ANSWERED RIDERHOOD
THUS BAPTIZED UNTO DEATH WITH THESE FLYING IMPURITIES NOW FLUNG UPON YOUR FACE WHY NOT SPEAK FATHER SOAKING INTO THIS FILTHY GROUND AS YOU LIE HERE IS YOUR OWN SHAPE DID YOU NEVER SEE SUCH A SHAPE SOAKED INTO YOUR BOAT
LET US HEAR WHAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD JOHN ROKESMITH READ HIS ABSTRACTS ALOUD THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THE NEW HOUSE DECORATOR'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH FURNITURE ESTIMATE SO MUCH ESTIMATE FOR FURNITURE OF OFFICES
AND HARD WORK HOLDING FORTH AT THAT IMMEASURABLE LENGTH TO EUGENE WHEN HE HAD BEEN RESCUED WITH A ROPE FROM THE RUNNING PAVEMENT FOR MAKING OFF IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY MANNER BUT HE OFFERED SUCH AMPLE APOLOGIES AND WAS SO VERY PENITENT
BUT THERE'S GENERALLY ONE PROVIDED MISTER ROKESMITH AGAIN EXPLAINED DEFINING THE DUTIES HE SOUGHT TO UNDERTAKE AS THOSE OF GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OR MANAGER OR OVERLOOKER OR MAN OF BUSINESS NOW FOR INSTANCE COME
FOR HE FELT WITH SOME NATURAL INDIGNATION THAT THAT FUNCTIONARY MIGHT OTHERWISE SUSPECT HIM OF HAVING CLOSED HIS EYES OR WANDERED IN HIS ATTENTION HERE JUST BEFORE US YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD WITH DIGNITY
COME ABOARD OF MINE AND SEE FOR YOUR OWN SELVES THERE WAS A LITTLE BACKWARDNESS IN COMPLYING FOR THE FREIGHT LOOKED TOO MUCH FOR THE BOAT BUT ON RIDERHOOD'S PROTESTING
AS HE HAD MANY A TIME LOOKED DOWN ON MANY ANOTHER MAN THE WAY OF IT WAS THIS OF COURSE YOU GENTLEMEN HARDLY FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS TOWING BY THE NECK AND ARMS THEY HAD HELPED TO RELEASE THE ROPE AND OF COURSE NOT
IT HAD THE CURVES AND INDENTATIONS IN IT STILL
ALL THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY CREPT WERE SO HUGE IN CONTRAST WITH THEIR WRETCHED BOAT AS TO THREATEN TO CRUSH IT NOT A SHIP'S HULL WITH ITS RUSTY IRON LINKS OF CABLE RUN OUT OF HAWSE HOLES LONG DISCOLOURED WITH THE IRON'S RUSTY TEARS
I SAID SECRETARY ASSENTED MISTER ROKESMITH IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AT THE TIME SAID MISTER BOFFIN AND IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AND MISSUS BOFFIN WHEN WE SPOKE OF IT AFTERWARDS BECAUSE NOT TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF OUR BELIEF
AND FOUND GUILTY AND HAD ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS AND BEEN MARCHED OUT TO BE SHOT BEFORE THE DOOR BANGED HARD WORK ROWING THE CAB THROUGH THE CITY TO THE TEMPLE FOR A CUP OF FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND POUNDS VALUE GIVEN BY MISTER BOFFIN
AND YOU WILL OBSERVE NOW THAT THIS KNOT WHICH WAS DRAWN CHOCK TIGHT ROUND HIS NECK BY THE STRAIN OF HIS OWN ARMS IS A SLIP KNOT HOLDING IT UP FOR DEMONSTRATION PLAIN ENOUGH
LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW
THAT HIS EYES WERE PROMINENT AND FIXED AND HIS BREATHING WAS STERTOROUS WHEN TO THE GREAT RELIEF OF MISSUS BOFFIN WHO OBSERVED THESE SYMPTOMS WITH ALARM THE YARD BELL RANG WHO'S THAT I WONDER SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
FIRST I'LL TELL YOU MORE THERE WAS SILVER IN EM HOW DO I MAKE THAT OUT SIMPLE AND SATISFACTORY BECAUSE HE'S GOT IT HERE THE LECTURER HELD UP THE TIGHTLY CLENCHED RIGHT HAND WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THE REMAINS ASKED LIGHTWOOD
IT'S NO GOOD THIS SORT OF GAME YOU KNOW YOU MUST COME UP I MEAN TO HAVE YOU THERE WAS SO MUCH VIRTUE IN THIS DISTINCTLY AND DECIDEDLY MEANING TO HAVE IT THAT IT YIELDED A LITTLE EVEN WHILE THE LINE WAS PLAYED I TOLD YOU SO QUOTH MISTER INSPECTOR PULLING OFF HIS OUTER COAT
BUT SEEMED TO BE THERE WITH A FELL INTENTION NOT A FIGURE HEAD BUT HAD THE MENACING LOOK OF BURSTING FORWARD TO RUN THEM DOWN NOT A SLUICE GATE
THAT HE HAD HAD HALF A DOZEN DEAD AND ALIVE IN HER AFORE NOW AND SHE WAS NOTHING DEEP IN THE WATER NOR DOWN IN THE STERN EVEN THEN TO SPEAK OF THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND TRIMMED THE CRAZY THING WHILE THEY WERE DOING SO RIDERHOOD STILL SAT STARING DISCONSOLATE
SO MUCH COACH MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HORSE DEALER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HARNESS MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH GOLDSMITH'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH TOTAL SO VERY MUCH THEN CAME CORRESPONDENCE
MISTER BOFFIN DREW A LONG BREATH LAID DOWN HIS PEN LOOKED AT HIS NOTES AS DOUBTING WHETHER HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AND APPEARED ON A SECOND PERUSAL OF THEIR COUNTENANCES TO BE CONFIRMED IN HIS IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD NOT
IF YOU WOULDN'T OBJECT TO STANDING BY HIM HALF A MINUTE SIR WAS THE REPLY I'LL FIND THE NEAREST OF OUR MEN TO COME AND TAKE CHARGE OF HIM I STILL CALL IT HIM YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR LOOKING BACK AS HE WENT WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SMILE UPON THE FORCE OF HABIT
SO A HALFPENNY WORTH OF INK WOULD BLOT MISTER BOFFIN TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR AND THE CALVES OF HIS LEGS WITHOUT INSCRIBING A LINE ON THE PAPER BEFORE HIM OR APPEARING TO DIMINISH IN THE INKSTAND MISTER BOFFIN WAS IN SUCH SEVERE LITERARY DIFFICULTIES
WORDS NEVER TO BE ANSWERED THOSE UPON THE EARTH SIDE OF THE GRAVE THE WIND SWEEPS JEERINGLY OVER FATHER WHIPS HIM WITH THE FRAYED ENDS OF HIS DRESS AND HIS JAGGED HAIR
HE POINTED BEHIND HIM AT THE BOAT AND GASPED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE DROPPED UPON THE STONES TO GET HIS BREATH GAFFER'S DONE ME IT'S GAFFER THEY RAN TO THE ROPE LEAVING HIM GASPING THERE SOON THE FORM OF THE BIRD OF PREY
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT NOW AND HE LOOKED ABOUT BUT NO EUGENE WAS IN ALL THE VIEW MISTER INSPECTOR SPEEDILY RETURNING DOWN THE WOODEN STAIRS WITH A POLICE CONSTABLE LIGHTWOOD ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HIS FRIEND LEAVE THEM MISTER INSPECTOR
AND HE LOOKED AT THEM ABOUT AS HOPEFULLY AS AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN MIGHT LOOK AT A CROWD OF TROOPS WHOM HE WAS REQUIRED AT FIVE MINUTES NOTICE TO MANOEUVRE AND REVIEW HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME ATTEMPTS TO MAKE NOTES OF THESE PAPERS BUT BEING TROUBLED AS MEN OF HIS STAMP OFTEN ARE
IF IT WAS ME THAT HAD THE LAW OF THIS HERE JOB IN HAND GROWLED RIDERHOOD WITH A THREATENING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD BLEST IF I WOULDN'T LAY HOLD OF HER AT ANY RATE AY BUT IT IS NOT YOU SAID EUGENE
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING TO MISTER RIDERHOOD ANNOUNCED HIS OFFICIAL INTENTION OF KEEPING HIS EYE UPON HIM STOOD HIM IN A CORNER OF THE FIREPLACE LIKE A WET UMBRELLA AND TOOK NO FURTHER OUTWARD AND VISIBLE NOTICE OF THAT HONEST MAN
WHICH I HOPE MISTER BOFFIN MIGHT EXCUSE SHOULD MAKE YOU SIGH I'LL STRIKE THE LIGHT GUITAR CORRECT TO THE LETTER SAID MISTER BOFFIN AND I CONSIDER THAT THE POETRY BRINGS US BOTH IN IN A BEAUTIFUL MANNER
WHY WHAT BLOODSHOT DRAGGLED DISHEVELLED SPECTACLE IS THIS CRIED MORTIMER
AND HAD HOT BRANDY AND WATER TOO YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AND THEN CUT OFF AT A GREAT RATE WHO SAID LIGHTWOOD YOUR FRIEND YOU KNOW I KNOW HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH DIGNITY AFTER HEARING IN A MIST THROUGH WHICH MISTER INSPECTOR LOOMED VAGUE AND LARGE
ME AND MISSUS BOFFIN WENT TO LOOK AT IT AND FINDING IT BEYOND A DOUBT EMINENTLY ARISTOCRATIC
HE SEES SOME OBJECT THAT'S IN HIS WAY OF BUSINESS FLOATING HE MAKES READY TO SECURE THAT OBJECT HE UNWINDS THE END OF HIS COIL THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE SOME TURNS ON IN HIS BOAT AND HE TAKES TURNS ENOUGH ON IT TO SECURE THAT IT SHAN'T RUN OUT
AND WHEN THAT SECOND HEAP WAS COMPLETE AND THE FIRST GONE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A PIECE OF STRING AND TIED IT TOGETHER WITH A REMARKABLY DEXTEROUS HAND AT A RUNNING CURVE AND A LOOP GOOD SAID MISTER BOFFIN VERY GOOD NOW
NOW HE'S MORE LIKE HIMSELF THOUGH HE'S BADLY BRUISED WHEN THIS MAN THAT WAS ROWS OUT UPON THE RIVER ON HIS USUAL LAY HE CARRIES WITH HIM THIS COIL OF ROPE HE ALWAYS CARRIES WITH HIM THIS COIL OF ROPE IT'S AS WELL KNOWN TO ME AS HE WAS HIMSELF
THAT AN UNBROKEN CONTINUANCE OF THOSE RELATIONS MUST INEVITABLY TERMINATE IN OUR FLYING TO OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE EARTH I ALSO FELT THAT I HAD COMMITTED EVERY CRIME IN THE NEWGATE CALENDAR SO FOR MINGLED CONSIDERATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND FELONY
IN THE SENSE OF STEWARD WHY AS TO STEWARD YOU SEE RETURNED MISTER BOFFIN WITH HIS HAND STILL TO HIS CHIN THE ODDS ARE THAT MISSUS BOFFIN AND ME MAY NEVER GO UPON THE WATER BEING BOTH BAD SAILORS WE SHOULD WANT A STEWARD IF WE DID
AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
WHEN HE CAME SCRAMBLING BACK AS PALE AS THE MORNING AND GASPED OUT BY THE LORD HE'S DONE ME
THAT HE HAD BECOME A MERE SOMNAMBULIST HE WAS TOO TIRED TO REST IN HIS SLEEP UNTIL HE WAS EVEN TIRED OUT OF BEING TOO TIRED AND DROPPED INTO OBLIVION LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE AWOKE
SOMETIMES IT LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS BOAT SOMETIMES HE HUNG IT LOOSE ROUND HIS NECK HE WAS A LIGHT DRESSER WAS THIS MAN YOU SEE LIFTING THE LOOSE NECKERCHIEF OVER HIS BREAST AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF WIPING THE DEAD LIPS WITH IT
I TELL YOU WHAT SAID MISTER BOFFIN SLOWLY CRUMPLING HIS OWN BLOTTED NOTE IN HIS HAND IF YOU'LL TURN TO AT THESE PRESENT PAPERS AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF EM I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT I CAN MAKE OF YOU NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
THAT HE DROPPED UNDER THE LEE OF A TIER OF SHIPPING AND THEY LAY THERE UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE SQUALL HAD COME UP LIKE A SPITEFUL MESSENGER BEFORE THE MORNING THERE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE A RAGGED TEAR OF LIGHT WHICH RIPPED THE DARK CLOUDS UNTIL THEY SHOWED A GREAT GREY HOLE OF DAY
NOT SO EASY DONE HIS LUCK'S GOT FOULED UNDER THE KEELS OF THE BARGES I TRIED TO HAUL IN LAST TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE HOW TAUT THE LINE IS
BUT CONSIDER SUCH A NIGHT FOR PLUMAGE SUCH A NIGHT REPEATED MORTIMER WHAT BECAME OF YOU IN THE MORNING MY DEAR FELLOW SAID EUGENE SITTING ON HIS BED I FELT THAT WE HAD BORED ONE ANOTHER SO LONG
RELINQUISHING HIS HAT AND GLOVES MISTER ROKESMITH SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT THE TABLE ARRANGED THE OPEN PAPERS INTO AN ORDERLY HEAP CAST HIS EYES OVER EACH IN SUCCESSION FOLDED IT DOCKETED IT ON THE OUTSIDE LAID IT IN A SECOND HEAP
MISTER ROKESMITH APPEARED SIT DOWN SIR SAID MISTER BOFFIN SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM MISSUS BOFFIN YOU'RE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH
THEN IN A RUSH IT CRUELLY TAUNTS HIM FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME WAS IT YOU THE VOICELESS AND THE DEAD WAS IT YOU THUS BUFFETED AS YOU LIE HERE IN A HEAP WAS IT YOU
BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
WERE SEEN PERILOUSLY STAGGERING UP LADDERS CARRYING STORM WINDOWS AND SCREWING THEM TO SECOND STORY JAMBS WHILE KENNICOTT PUT UP HIS WINDOWS CAROL DANCED INSIDE THE BEDROOMS AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO SWALLOW THE SCREWS
STORM SHEDS WERE ERECTED AT EVERY DOOR IN EVERY BLOCK THE HOUSEHOLDERS SAM CLARK THE WEALTHY MISTER DAWSON ALL SAVE ASTHMATIC EZRA STOWBODY WHO EXTRAVAGANTLY HIRED A BOY
DECLARED SAM AND KENNICOTT AND DAVE DYER JOINED IN A PROUD YOU BET CAROL WALKED OUT HASTILY KENNICOTT OBSERVING HER THROUGH SUPPER TIME SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS BUBBLING AND WOULD SOON BOIL OVER
SHE COULDN'T SATISFY HER INGENUITY IN PLANNING MEALS AT DAHL AND OLESON'S MEAT MARKET YOU DIDN'T GIVE ORDERS YOU WOFULLY INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING TODAY BESIDES STEAK AND PORK AND HAM THE CUTS OF BEEF WERE NOT CUTS THEY WERE HACKS
THERE'VE BEEN A GOOD MANY TIMES WHEN WE HADN'T A MAID AND I DID ALL THE HOUSEWORK AND CARED FOR HUGH AND WENT TO RED CROSS AND DID IT ALL VERY EFFICIENTLY I'M A GOOD COOK AND A GOOD SWEEPER
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
ONLY I CHOOSE TO MAKE MY OWN DEFINITION OF RUNNING AWAY I DON'T CALL DO YOU REALIZE HOW BIG A WORLD THERE IS BEYOND THIS GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE YOU'D KEEP ME ALL MY LIFE IT MAY BE THAT SOME DAY I'LL COME BACK BUT NOT TILL I CAN BRING SOMETHING MORE THAN I HAVE NOW
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN
SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING FOR I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS FOR A YEAR PERHAPS FOR A LIFETIME I SEE WELL OF COURSE I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO SELL OUT MY PRACTISE AND GO ANYWHERE YOU SAY
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THE FARMERS HE IS ORGANIZING WILL DEPRIVE YOU TOWNSMEN OF THE MONEY YOU MAKE OUT OF MORTGAGES AND WHEAT AND SHOPS OF COURSE SINCE WE'RE AT WAR WITH GERMANY ANYTHING THAT ANY ONE OF US DOESN'T LIKE IS PRO GERMAN
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
THAT'LL BE ABOUT ALL FROM YOU I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR SNEERING AT THIS TOWN AND SAYING HOW UGLY AND DULL IT IS I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR REFUSING TO APPRECIATE GOOD FELLOWS LIKE SAM I'VE EVEN STOOD FOR YOUR RIDICULING OUR WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW CAMPAIGN
MISSUS KENNICOTT CONFIDED TO YE SCRIBE THAT SHE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MULTIFARIOUS WAR ACTIVITIES NOW CENTERING IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE RETURNING HER COUNTLESS FRIENDS WHO APPRECIATE HER SPLENDID LABORS WITH THE LOCAL RED CROSS
THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE SO DISCONTENTED I KNOW THAT'S WHAT MOST MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD EXPLAIN ALL I AM AND ALL I WANT AND I SHOULDN'T ARGUE WITH THEM
CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
HER LIVELIEST ACTIVITY NOW WAS ORGANIZING OUTDOOR SPORTS IN THE MOTOR PARALYZED TOWN THE AUTOMOBILE AND BRIDGE WHIST HAD NOT ONLY MADE MORE EVIDENT THE SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT THEY HAD ALSO ENFEEBLED THE LOVE OF ACTIVITY
WHAT EDITORIAL DID HE GET THAT FROM SHE WONDERED AS SHE PROTESTED SEE HERE MY BELOVED WHY CAN'T YOU TORIES DECLARE WAR HONESTLY YOU DON'T OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZER BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S SEDITIOUS
LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
AND KENNICOTT HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF HUMBLE AND COURT BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD THE DIM INJUSTICE OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY HIS SON LEFT HIM IRRITABLE HE FELT INJURED AN EVENT WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY TOUCH THEM BROUGHT DOWN HIS WRATH
FOR A MONTH THEY DISCUSSED IT THEY HURT EACH OTHER VERY MUCH AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE CLOSE TO WEEPING AND INVARIABLY HE USED BANAL PHRASES ABOUT HER DUTIES AND SHE USED PHRASES QUITE AS BANAL ABOUT FREEDOM AND THROUGH IT ALL
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
ALONG THE RAILROAD THE SECTIONS OF SNOW FENCE WHICH HAD BEEN STACKED ALL SUMMER IN ROMANTIC WOODEN TENTS OCCUPIED BY ROVING SMALL BOYS WERE SET UP TO PREVENT DRIFTS FROM COVERING THE TRACK
IN THE EARLY AUTUMN NEWS CAME FROM WAKAMIN THAT THE SHERIFF HAD FORBIDDEN AN ORGANIZER FOR THE NATIONAL NONPARTISAN LEAGUE TO SPEAK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTY THE ORGANIZER HAD DEFIED THE SHERIFF
REALIZE HOW VALUABLE SHE WILL BE TO ANY WAR BOARD WITH WHICH SHE CHOOSES TO BECOME CONNECTED GOPHER PRAIRIE THUS ADDS ANOTHER SHINING STAR TO ITS SERVICE FLAG AND WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOCK ANY NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES
ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
THEY SAY THERE'S A CHANCE WE MAY GET ANOTHER FACTORY CREAM SEPARATOR WORKS HE ADDED YOU MIGHT TRY TO LOOK INTERESTED EVEN IF YOU AIN'T THE BABY WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE JOVIAN ROAR RAN WAILING TO HIDE HIS FACE IN CAROL'S LAP
AND EVEN IF I AM COWARDLY AND RUN AWAY ALL RIGHT CALL IT COWARDLY CALL ME ANYTHING YOU WANT TO I'VE BEEN RULED TOO LONG BY FEAR OF BEING CALLED THINGS I'M GOING AWAY TO BE QUIET AND THINK I'M I'M GOING I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OWN LIFE
WHY YOU SAY HE'S A ROUGHNECK AND YOU WON'T JUMP ON THE BAND WAGON ONCE WHEN KENNICOTT ANNOUNCED AT NOON DINNER
THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR
OH WE'RE HOPELESS WE DISSATISFIED WOMEN THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE US ABOUT THE PLACE TO FRET YOU SO IT'S FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I'M GOING OF COURSE A LITTLE THING LIKE HUGH MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
AND ALONE I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT MY WORK IS WORK WORK SURE THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH WORK TO DO IF YOU HAD FIVE KIDS AND NO HIRED GIRL
AND A WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND SILVER TEA SETS AND COOKIES COOKIES OH MOST DECIDEDLY COOKIES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BREAD AND PORRIDGE
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
AND GOPHER PRAIRIE TOOK AS MUCH PRIDE IN NEGLECTING COASTING AS SAINT PAUL OR NEW YORK IN GOING COASTING CAROL DID INSPIRE A SUCCESSFUL SKATING PARTY IN MID NOVEMBER
HE CALLED BOTH LYMAN CASS THE MILLER AND THE FINN HOMESTEADER FROM LOST LAKE BY THEIR FIRST NAMES HE WAS KNOWN AS THE RED SWEDE AND CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY INSANE BJORNSTAM COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIS HANDS SOLDER A PAN
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE
WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS COMPETITION OR BAD MUSIC IF WE WERE FIGHTING ENGLAND YOU'D CALL THE RADICALS PRO ENGLISH WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE CALLING THEM RED ANARCHISTS WHAT AN ETERNAL ART IT IS SUCH A GLITTERY DELIGHTFUL ART
WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER EXCELLENT FOR INSTEAD OF SLIPPING DOWNWARD SHE BEGAN TO CLIMB SHE SIGHED I COULDN'T DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR WILL'S KINDNESS HIS GIVING ME MONEY BUT A SECOND AFTER
THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
YES SHE GIVES ME COOKIES AND SHE TELLS ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD AUNTIE BOGART SAYS I'M GOING TO BE A PREACHER CAN I BE A PREACHER CAN I PREACH ABOUT THE DEAR LORD
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
AND ANNOUNCED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD ADDRESS A FARMERS POLITICAL MEETING THAT NIGHT THE NEWS RAN A MOB OF A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LED BY THE SHERIFF THE TAME VILLAGE STREET AND THE SMUG VILLAGE FACES RUDDLED BY THE LIGHT OF BOBBING LANTERNS
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
HER COLLAR WHITE WITH FROST FROM HER BREATH SHE BOUGHT A CAN OF TOMATOES AS THOUGH IT WERE ORIENT FRUIT AND RETURNED HOME PLANNING TO SURPRISE KENNICOTT WITH AN OMELET CREOLE FOR DINNER SO BRILLIANT WAS THE SNOW GLARE
THE WORLD WAS SO LUMINOUS THAT SHE SAT DOWN AT HER RICKETY LITTLE DESK IN THE LIVING ROOM TO MAKE A POEM SHE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE SKY IS BRIGHT THE SUN IS WARM THERE NE'ER WILL BE ANOTHER STORM
AND THE NOTARY HAD ARRIVED THOUGH HIS COMING WAS ANNOUNCED IN A VERY LOW TONE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN AROSE FROM HER PILLOW THE NOTARY SHE EXCLAIMED LET HIM COME IN
AS FROM A PERSON SUFFERING IN HIS DREAMS AND HE SUDDENLY THREW HIS HEAD BACK VIOLENTLY I CALLED THE VALET I STOPPED THE POSTILION
OF ONLY ONE OF MY SENSES I HEARD MY GLASS REMOVED THE SAME WHICH IS THERE NOW ON THE TABLE OH DEAR MOTHER IT WAS A DREAM SO LITTLE WAS IT A DREAM THAT I STRETCHED MY HAND TOWARDS THE BELL
VALENTINE DURST NOT OPPOSE HER GRANDMOTHER'S WISH THE CAUSE OF WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS VILLEFORT ENTERED
THAT THE ONLY REST HE NEEDED WAS TO SEE HIS CHILD BUT WISHED HER GOOD NIGHT FOR GRIEF AND FATIGUE HAD MADE HER APPEAR QUITE ILL THE NEXT MORNING SHE FOUND HER GRANDMOTHER IN BED THE FEVER HAD NOT ABATED
HAD ALWAYS EXPRESSED A DESIRE IN CASE HIS DEATH HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE FROM PARIS THAT HIS BODY MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO THE FAMILY VAULT I HAD HIM PUT INTO A LEADEN COFFIN
OH MY POOR MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT TO HAVE SUCH DUTIES TO PERFORM AT YOUR AGE AFTER SUCH A BLOW GOD HAS SUPPORTED ME THROUGH ALL AND THEN
NO MY CHILD NO SAID MADAME DE SAINT MERAN BUT I WAS IMPATIENTLY WAITING FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THAT I MIGHT SEND FOR YOUR FATHER MY FATHER INQUIRED VALENTINE UNEASILY YES I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM
YES MADAME IS HE NOT THE SON OF GENERAL D'EPINAY WHO WAS ON OUR SIDE AND WHO WAS ASSASSINATED SOME DAYS BEFORE THE USURPER RETURNED FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA THE SAME
I THINK THAT WHEN ONE IS IN TROUBLE ONE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF WEEPING WHERE IS VALENTINE SIR IT IS ON HER ACCOUNT I AM HERE I WISH TO SEE VALENTINE
THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
THE NOTARY WHO WAS AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY ENTERED GO VALENTINE
YOU MADAME YOU DEAR MAMMA
CHAPTER SEVENTY TWO MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
OH YES SIR HE TOLD ME
AND GRANDPAPA
WHAT A MISFORTUNE I SHALL DIE OF IT OH YES I SHALL CERTAINLY DIE OF IT AND THEN FALLING UPON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR SHE BURST INTO A PAROXYSM OF SOBS THE SERVANTS
AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
YES SUDDENLY FROM AN APOPLECTIC STROKE AN APOPLECTIC STROKE REPEATED THE DOCTOR YES AND MY POOR GRANDMOTHER FANCIES THAT HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE NEVER LEFT HAS CALLED HER AND THAT SHE MUST GO AND JOIN HIM
VILLEFORT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO REPLY THAT VALENTINE WAS AT A BALL SO HE ONLY SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT WITH HER STEP MOTHER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE FETCHED THIS INSTANT SIR THIS INSTANT I BESEECH YOU
WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT IT AH YES IT IS INDEED STRANGE AND THE WRETCHED FAMILY DEPARTED LEAVING A CLOUD OF SADNESS HANGING OVER THE REST OF THE EVENING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS VALENTINE FOUND BARROIS AWAITING HER
WE NEED NOT SAY WHICH PORTION OF THE GARDEN WAS HER FAVORITE WALK AFTER REMAINING FOR A SHORT TIME IN THE PARTERRE SURROUNDING THE HOUSE AND GATHERING A ROSE TO PLACE IN HER WAIST OR HAIR SHE TURNED INTO THE DARK AVENUE WHICH LED TO THE BENCH
WE EXPECT HIM EVERY MOMENT IT IS WELL AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES INFORM ME WE MUST BE EXPEDITIOUS AND THEN I ALSO WISH TO SEE A NOTARY THAT I MAY BE ASSURED
THE NOISE OF A CARRIAGE SOUNDED IN THE YARD THEN HE HEARD THE STEPS OF AN AGED PERSON ASCENDING THE STAIRS FOLLOWED BY TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SUCH AS SERVANTS ALWAYS GIVE VENT TO
AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING UPON THE POLITICAL FUTURE THAT HAD SO OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS AMBITIOUS DREAMS WAS IMAGINING A FUTURE LIMITED TO THE ENJOYMENTS OF HOME IN FEAR OF AWAKENING THE ENEMY THAT HAD SO LONG SLEPT
AND DIFFICULT AND HER PULSE BEAT WITH FEVERISH EXCITEMENT SHE WAS THINKING OF THE DESPAIR OF MAXIMILIAN WHEN HE SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT MADAME DE SAINT MERAN INSTEAD OF BEING AN ALLY WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING AS HIS ENEMY
A DOCTOR SAID SHE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS I AM NOT ILL I AM THIRSTY THAT IS ALL WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING DEAR GRANDMAMMA THE SAME AS USUAL MY DEAR MY GLASS IS THERE ON THE TABLE
ANTOINETTE IS VERY WELL HE SAID AND MADELEINE TOLERABLY SO BUT YOU SENT FOR ME MY DEAR CHILD IT IS NOT YOUR FATHER OR MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO IS ILL AS FOR YOU
OUR BUSINESS CONCERNS VALENTINE LET US LEAVE THE DEAD IN PEACE ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH SUCH EXCEEDING RAPIDITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED LIKE THE BEGINNING OF DELIRIUM
MAY HAVE HEARD IT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF BUT WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF UPON THE SUBJECT ASKED VILLEFORT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
AND THIS MORNING SHE FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I THOUGHT HER MAD AND MY FATHER WHO YOU KNOW IS A STRONG MINDED MAN HIMSELF APPEARED DEEPLY IMPRESSED WE WILL GO AND SEE SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT YOU TELL ME SEEMS VERY STRANGE
WHEN HE HAD RUN OVER ALL THESE NAMES IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN READ AND STUDIED THEM COMMENTING MEANWHILE UPON HIS LISTS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE MURMURED
HIS QUICK INTELLIGENT EYE INTERROGATED THE MESSENGER ALAS SIR EXCLAIMED BARROIS A GREAT MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED MADAME DE SAINT MERAN HAS ARRIVED AND HER HUSBAND IS DEAD
WITHOUT THAT WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BARROIS WHO WISHED TO GO TO BED HIMSELF OBSERVED THAT AFTER SUCH SAD EVENTS EVERY ONE STOOD IN NEED OF REST NOIRTIER WOULD NOT SAY
ALWAYS I TELL YOU I AM GOING TO DIE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WELL BEFORE DYING I WISH TO SEE MY SON IN LAW I WISH TO TELL HIM TO MAKE MY CHILD HAPPY I WISH TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE INTENDS TO OBEY ME
THE NOTARY HERE DESCENDED AND VALENTINE WAS INFORMED THAT HER GRANDMOTHER WAS ALONE GO UPSTAIRS SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR AND YOU OH I DARE NOT SHE FORBADE MY SENDING FOR YOU AND
AND BEHOLDING THE MAN WHO SO FORCIBLY REMINDED HER OF HER DEEPLY REGRETTED CHILD WHO STILL LIVED FOR HER IN VALENTINE SHE FELT TOUCHED AT THE NAME OF MOTHER AND BURSTING INTO TEARS SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE AN ARM CHAIR
BUT WHEN I DID SO THE SHADE DISAPPEARED MY MAID THEN ENTERED WITH A LIGHT BUT SHE SAW NO ONE PHANTOMS ARE VISIBLE TO THOSE ONLY WHO OUGHT TO SEE THEM IT WAS THE SOUL OF MY HUSBAND WELL
THOUGH SHE HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO PUT ON THE OUTWARD SEMBLANCE OF WOE SHE THEN TURNED TOWARDS THE AVENUE AS SHE ADVANCED SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING HER NAME SHE STOPPED ASTONISHED
VALENTINE KISSED THE OLD MAN WHO LOOKED AT HER WITH SUCH TENDERNESS THAT HER EYES AGAIN FILLED WITH TEARS WHOSE SOURCES HE THOUGHT MUST BE EXHAUSTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONTINUED TO DWELL UPON HER WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION
GIVE IT TO ME VALENTINE VALENTINE POURED THE ORANGEADE INTO A GLASS AND GAVE IT TO HER GRANDMOTHER WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DREAD FOR IT WAS THE SAME GLASS SHE FANCIED THAT HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE SPECTRE
THAT ALL OUR PROPERTY RETURNS TO VALENTINE AH GRANDMAMMA MURMURED VALENTINE PRESSING HER LIPS ON THE BURNING BROW DO YOU WISH TO KILL ME OH HOW FEVERISH YOU ARE WE MUST NOT SEND FOR A NOTARY BUT FOR A DOCTOR
NONE OF MY ENEMIES WOULD HAVE WAITED SO PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY FOR SO LONG A SPACE OF TIME THAT THEY MIGHT NOW COME AND CRUSH ME WITH THIS SECRET SOMETIMES AS HAMLET SAYS FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE
AND THAT THE VEINS OF HIS TEMPLES THROBBED MORE VIOLENTLY THAN USUAL HOWEVER AS IT BECAME DARK AND I COULD NO LONGER SEE I FELL ASLEEP I WAS SOON AROUSED BY A PIERCING SHRIEK
AND VALENTINE KNEW HOW THE HAUGHTY MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN DESPISED ALL WHO WERE NOT NOBLE HER SECRET HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPRESSED
BUT GRANDMAMMA LEAVE ME GO THE YOUNG GIRL KISSED HER GRANDMOTHER AND LEFT WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES AT THE DOOR SHE FOUND THE VALET DE CHAMBRE WHO TOLD HER THAT THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING IN THE DINING ROOM
DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION VALENTINE HAD REMAINED SILENT WELL SIR SAID MADAME DE SAINT MERAN AFTER A FEW MINUTES REFLECTION I MUST HASTEN THE MARRIAGE FOR I HAVE BUT A SHORT TIME TO LIVE
VALENTINE CAME UP TO NOIRTIER ON LEAVING MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WHO IN THE MIDST OF HER GRIEF HAD AT LAST YIELDED TO FATIGUE AND FALLEN INTO A FEVERISH SLEEP WITHIN REACH OF HER HAND THEY PLACED A SMALL TABLE
YOUR GRANDMAMMA HAS JUST ARRIVED VALENTINE
AFTER HAVING EATEN SOME OF THE LOZENGES HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE HE FELL INTO SUCH A DEEP SLEEP THAT IT APPEARED TO ME UNNATURAL STILL I HESITATED TO WAKE HIM ALTHOUGH I FANCIED THAT HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED
SHE FANCIED THIS MORNING IN HER SLEEP THAT HER SOUL WAS HOVERING ABOVE HER BODY WHICH SHE AT THE SAME TIME WATCHED IT MUST HAVE BEEN DELIRIUM SHE FANCIES TOO THAT SHE SAW A PHANTOM ENTER HER CHAMBER
IT SHALL BE AS YOU WISH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT MORE ESPECIALLY SINCE YOUR WISHES COINCIDE WITH MINE
BUT LIKE A PHOSPHORIC LIGHT THEY RISE BUT TO MISLEAD THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE CORSICAN TO SOME PRIEST WHO IN HIS TURN HAS REPEATED IT
SAID THE OLD LADY VILLEFORT PLACED THE ARM OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WITHIN HIS OWN AND CONDUCTED HER TO HIS APARTMENT REST YOURSELF MOTHER HE SAID THE MARCHIONESS RAISED HER HEAD AT THIS WORD
ALAS SAID VALENTINE RESTRAINING HER TEARS MY GRANDFATHER IS DEAD
MORE THAN ONCE SHE THOUGHT OF REVEALING ALL TO HER GRANDMOTHER AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED A MOMENT IF MAXIMILIAN MORREL HAD BEEN NAMED ALBERT DE MORCERF OR RAOUL DE CHATEAU RENAUD BUT MORREL
ALTHOUGH WE DOCTORS CANNOT DIVEST OUR PATIENTS OF NERVES I FANCY YOU HAVE NO FURTHER NEED OF ME THAN TO RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO ALLOW YOUR IMAGINATION TO TAKE TOO WIDE A FIELD VALENTINE COLORED
BY THE SAD CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DO SO FOR WERE IT ONCE DISCOVERED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER ALL WOULD BE LOST TWO HOURS PASSED THUS
I BESEECH YOU DO SOMETHING FOR HER WHERE IS SHE IN HER ROOM WITH THE NOTARY
AND WILL MEET HIM IF NOT WITH PLEASURE AT LEAST WITH INDIFFERENCE IS IT A SUITABLE MATCH IN EVERY RESPECT AND THE YOUNG MAN IS REGARDED WITH UNIVERSAL ESTEEM
USUALLY WELL FRINGED WITH SHRUBS AND TREES AND PRESENTING THE POLISHED SURFACES GIVEN THEM BY THE GLACIER THAT BROUGHT THEM INTO RELIEF ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN BROAD MORAINE BEDS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED AND ON THESE
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE TELLING NO ONE NOT EVEN HIS WIFE WHAT HE HAD DONE AFTER WAITING SEVERAL DAYS AS THE DOG SHIRO DID NOT RETURN HIS MASTER BEGAN TO GROW ANXIOUS
AND HIS MASTER GAVE HIM THE FOOD NEXT DOOR TO THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE THERE LIVED ANOTHER OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE BOTH WICKED AND CRUEL AND WHO HATED THEIR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THE DOG SHIRO WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
AND TO THE BIG TUOLUMNE CANYON WITH ITS GLORIOUS ABUNDANCE OF ROCK AND FALLING GLIDING TOSSING WATER FOR ALL THESE THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FORM A DELIGHTFUL CENTER
WHOSE INFLUENCE IS SO MYSTERIOUS ON EVERY ONE WHO SEES IT OF THE SMALL GLACIER LAKES SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE UPPER REGIONS THERE ARE NO FEWER THAN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE BASIN OF THE MAIN MIDDLE BRANCH BESIDES COUNTLESS SMALLER POOLS
SWAYING AND SWIRLING WITH EASY GRACEFUL GESTURES AND SINGING THE LAST OF ITS MOUNTAIN SONGS BEFORE IT REACHES THE DIZZY EDGE OF YOSEMITE
AND SCATTERED THEM OVER THE TREE BUT NOT ONLY DID THE TREE NOT BURST INTO FLOWER
MAKING A GRAND TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN LAKES WHOSE WATERS COME TO SING AT YOSEMITE SO GLORIOUS IS THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREAT VALLEY SO HARMONIOUS ITS RELATIONS TO ITS WIDESPREADING FOUNTAINS
WHILE ITS BROAD OPEN BASIN BETWEEN ITS FOUNTAIN MOUNTAINS AND CANYON IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS LAKES AND FORESTS AND MAGNIFICENT MORAINES RETURNING TO THE VALLEY AND GOING UP THE NORTH BRANCH OF TENAYA CANYON
CLAD IN GAUZY SUN SIFTED SPRAY HALF FALLING HALF FLOATING IT SEEMS INFINITELY GENTLE AND FINE BUT THE HYMNS IT SINGS
BUT SHIRO WENT ON BARKING AND DIGGING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE HIDDEN BENEATH THE TREE AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED IT AT LAST STRUCK THE OLD MAN HE RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE
A BUILDING OF ONE STONE SEWN FROM THE LIVING ROCK WITH SIDES ROOF GABLE SPIRE AND ORNAMENTAL PINNACLES FASHIONED AND FINISHED SYMMETRICALLY LIKE A WORK OF ART AND SET ON A WELL GRADED PLATEAU
AND NOW JUST AS HE SEEMED ON THE POINT OF FINDING WHAT HE SOUGHT ONLY A HORRID SMELLING REFUSE HEAP HAD REWARDED HIM FOR A MORNING'S DIGGING INSTEAD OF BLAMING HIS OWN GREED FOR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HE BLAMED THE POOR DOG
EVEN THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR COULD NOT REFUSE SUCH A SIMPLE REQUEST SO HE CONSENTED TO GIVE THE OLD MAN THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHIRO LAY BURIED SHIRO'S MASTER THEN CUT THE TREE DOWN AND CARRIED IT HOME OUT OF THE TRUNK HE MADE A MORTAR
NEVER FAIL TO CHARM ITS HEIGHT FROM ITS BASE TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF
FINE THRIFTY FORESTS ARE GROWING LAKES AND MEADOWS AND SMALL SPONGY BOGS MAY BE FOUND HIDING HERE AND THERE IN THE WOODS OR BACK IN THE FOUNTAIN RECESSES OF MOUNT HOFFMAN WHILE A THOUSAND GARDENS ARE PLANTED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE STREAMS
SO THAT SHIRO BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND DIG IN ORDER TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE HORRID OLD MAN'S GRASP
TO ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH IT BEYOND THE CASCADES NO GREAT DIFFICULTY WILL BE ENCOUNTERED A SUCCESSION OF CHARMING LILY GARDENS AND MEADOWS OCCURS IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS AMONG THE ROCK WAVES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANYON
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
SHIRO SAT BY ERECT WITH PRIDE AND LOOKING FONDLY AT HIS MASTER AS IF TO SAY YOU SEE THOUGH ONLY A DOG I CAN MAKE SOME RETURN FOR ALL THE KINDNESS YOU SHOW ME THE OLD MAN RAN IN TO CALL HIS WIFE
MAKING A VERTICAL DESCENT IN ALL OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET JUST BEYOND THE DOME CASCADES ON THE SHOULDER OF MOUNT WATKINS THERE IS AN OLD TRAIL ONCE USED BY INDIANS ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RANGE TO MONO BUT IN THE CANYON ABOVE THIS POINT
DAY AFTER DAY WENT BY AND THE GOOD OLD MAN WAITED IN VAIN THEN HE WENT TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS DOG WITHOUT ANY SHAME OR HESITATION
THEY HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS A WONDERFUL OLD MAN WHO COULD MAKE WITHERED TREES TO BLOSSOM AND THAT HIS LORD HAD SENT HIM TO ASK THE OLD MAN TO COME TO HIM AND ADDED THE KNIGHT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL COME AT ONCE
PASSING THE CATHEDRAL WE DESCEND INTO THE DELIGHTFUL SPACIOUS TUOLUMNE VALLEY FROM WHICH EXCURSIONS MAY BE MADE TO MOUNTS DANA LYELL RITTER CONNESS AND MONO LAKE
THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR CAME TO SEE THE WONDERFUL SIGHT ONE DAY SOON AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN HEARD SOME ONE KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR
ARE YOU THE OLD MAN WHO CAN MAKE WITHERED TREES FLOWER EVEN OUT OF SEASON THE OLD MAN MADE AN OBEISANCE AND REPLIED I AM THAT OLD MAN THEN THE DAIMIO SAID
THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED THAT HE HAD KILLED SHIRO BECAUSE OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AT THIS DREADFUL NEWS SHIRO'S MASTER WEPT MANY SAD AND BITTER TEARS GREAT INDEED WAS HIS WOFUL SURPRISE
AMONG THESE FLAT TOPPED PILLARS KISSING AND PLASHING NOTES AS WELL AS THUNDER LIKE DETONATIONS ARE PRODUCED LIKE THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE FALL THOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE THE RAINBOWS OF THE VEIL
LONG LONG AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO SUPPORTED THEMSELVES BY CULTIVATING A SMALL PLOT OF LAND THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY AND PEACEFUL ONE SAVE FOR ONE GREAT SORROW AND THIS WAS THEY HAD NO CHILD
ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE BRIDAL VEIL CREEK THE BASIN OF WHICH IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS MEADOWS AND ITS SUPERB FORESTS OF SILVER FIR ON THE NORTH SIDE
SEVERELY SIMPLE GLACIER SCULPTURED FACE OF GRANITE THE END OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPACT AND ENDURING OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES UNRIVALED IN HEIGHT AND BREADTH AND FLAWLESS STRENGTH
THE STREAM IS NEARLY FORTY FEET WIDE AND WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING RAPIDLY IN THE SPRING IT IS ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP WITH A CURRENT OF TWO AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR THIS IS ABOUT THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FORMS THE FALL IN MAY AND JUNE
SO INTENT WAS THE OLD MAN ON HIS WORK THAT HE NEVER SAW THE CROSS FACE OF HIS NEIGHBOR PEERING AT HIM THROUGH THE BAMBOO HEDGE AT LAST ALL THE GOLD COINS LAY SHINING ON THE GROUND
ON THE SOUTH THE VAST GRANITE WAVE OF CLOUDS REST A MILE IN HEIGHT AND BETWEEN THEM THE FINE TENAYA CASCADE WITH SILVERY PLUMES OUTSPREAD ON SMOOTH GLACIER POLISHED FOLDS OF GRANITE
BUT THAT HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING AND TORMENTING HIM WHENEVER THE DOG CROSSED HIS PATH BUT THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS TOO KIND HEARTED TO REFUSE HIS NEIGHBOR SO HE CONSENTED TO LEND THE DOG
SO HE SET TO WORK AND GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THE ASHES WHICH REMAINED IN THE FIRE PLACE FROM THE BURNING OF THE WONDERFUL MORTAR THEN HE SET OUT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME GREAT MAN TO EMPLOY HIM
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE SENTINEL ARE THE THREE BROTHERS AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS WITH THREE GABLES FRONTING THE VALLEY ONE ABOVE ANOTHER THE TOPMOST GABLE NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND FEET HIGH
LOOMS TISSIACK OR HALF DOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST SUBLIME OF ALL THE WONDERFUL YOSEMITE ROCKS RISING IN SERENE MAJESTY FROM FLOWERY GROVES AND MEADOWS
THINKING THAT HE HAD NOT USED ENOUGH ASHES THE OLD MAN TOOK HANDFULS AND AGAIN SPRINKLED THEM OVER THE WITHERED TREE BUT ALL TO NO EFFECT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES THE ASHES WERE BLOWN INTO THE DAIMIO'S EYES
THIS MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO ARREST THE FALSE HANA SAKA JIJII AT ONCE AND PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR AN IMPOSTOR FROM THIS IMPRISONMENT THE WICKED OLD MAN WAS NEVER FREED
NEXT TO THE CATHEDRAL ROCKS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TOWERS THE SENTINEL ROCK TO A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FEET A TELLING MONUMENT OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
THAT ONE OF THE FAVORITE CHERRY TREES IN THIS NOBLEMAN'S GARDEN HAD WITHERED
I BROKE IT TO PIECES AND NOW I AM MAKING A FIRE OF THE WOOD FOR WHEN I TRIED TO POUND CAKES IN IT ONLY SOME HORRID SMELLING STUFF CAME OUT THE GOOD OLD MAN SAID I AM VERY SORRY FOR THAT
NONE TOOK EFFECT THE KNIGHT WAS SORE PERPLEXED WHEN HE SAW WHAT GREAT DISPLEASURE THE LOSS OF HIS FAVORITE CHERRY TREE CAUSED THE DAIMIO AT THIS POINT FORTUNATELY
AND HASTENED TO HIS OWN FIELD FORCING THE UNWILLING SHIRO TO FOLLOW HIM AS SOON AS HE REACHED A YENOKI TREE HE SAID TO THE DOG THREATENINGLY
THE OLD MAN DID NOT IN THE LEAST WISH TO LEND IT TO HIS CRUEL NEIGHBOR BUT HE WAS TOO KIND TO REFUSE SO THE ENVIOUS MAN CARRIED HOME THE MORTAR BUT HE NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK SEVERAL DAYS PASSED
THE BRIDAL VEIL SHOOTS FREE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CLIFF BY THE VELOCITY THE STREAM HAS ACQUIRED IN DESCENDING A LONG SLOPE ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE FALL LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AVALANCHE TALUS ON THE WEST SIDE
BUT THE DAIMIO LOOKING AT HIM THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE OLD MAN HE HAD SEEN BEFORE SO HE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE MAN WHOM I NAMED HANA SAKA JIJII AND THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR ANSWERED WITH A LIE YES MY LORD
THERE MUST ALSO BE GOLD COINS UNDER MY TREE YOU MUST FIND THEM FOR ME WHERE ARE THEY WHERE WHERE AND CATCHING HOLD OF SHIRO'S NECK HE HELD THE DOG'S HEAD TO THE GROUND
IN THIS HIS WIFE PUT SOME RICE AND HE BEGAN TO POUND IT WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING A FESTIVAL TO THE MEMORY OF HIS DOG SHIRO A STRANGE THING HAPPENED HIS WIFE PUT THE RICE INTO THE MORTAR
IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR ATTRACTED BY SHIRO'S BARKING HAD BEEN AN UNSEEN AND ENVIOUS WITNESS OF THE FINDING OF THE TREASURE HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE TOO WOULD LIKE TO FIND A FORTUNE
INTO ANOTHER WORLD WHERE CLIMATE VEGETATION
WITH THE FINELY MODELED NORTH DOME THE ROYAL ARCHES AND WASHINGTON COLUMN ON OUR LEFT GLACIER POINT WITH ITS MASSIVE MAGNIFICENT SCULPTURE ON THE RIGHT AND IN THE MIDDLE DIRECTLY IN FRONT
AND TAKING UP HIS POSITION HERE THE OLD MAN SAT DOWN AND SCATTERED THE ASHES RIGHT AND LEFT ALL OVER THE BRANCHES AND TWIGS WONDERFUL INDEED WAS THE RESULT
IT WILL AMUSE ME TO LOOK ON SO THE RETAINERS WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE IMPOSTOR BEFORE THEIR LORD
BUT I APPEAL TO YOUR GENEROSITY OF HEART TO SUPPORT IT AND SAVE THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN FROM DEATH HAVE PITY ON HER BRAND WHITLOCK
BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
THE SHOREDITCH INFIRMARY IN HOXTON AND THE SAINT PANCRAS INFIRMARY AND SHE GAINED A REPUTATION BOTH FOR HARD WORK AND EFFICIENCY WHILE HER PATIENTS OFTEN SPOKE OF HER GENTLENESS AND HER KINDNESS NOT CONTENT WITH FORGETTING A PATIENT WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL
THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
TO MITIGATE THE SENTENCE AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING HE WAS TOLD THAT VON BISSING REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO SAVE MISS CAVELL'S LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR DENIED THIS APPEAL EDITH CAVELL WAS ALLOWED TO SEE A BRITISH CHAPLAIN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF DEATH
THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
HE NEVER INFORMED THEM THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED HE NEVER CAME TO SEE THEM AFTERWARD AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION AND FOR ASSISTANCE HE HAD DISAPPEARED MISS CAVELL WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
SILVERED AND PEARLED ON EVERY SCENTED STILL SPRAY THE SKY WAS DEEP CLEAR STRONG BLUE ABOVE AND AGAINST THE BLUE THE WALLFLOWERS SHONE BRAVELY FROM THE CRACKS AND CREVICES OF RUINED ARCH AND WALL AND BUTTRESS
ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMERICAN LEGATION SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED NONE AT SIX TWENTY IN THE EVENING THEY WERE TOLD BY A SUBORDINATE THAT THE SENTENCE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN
LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
WILL GO DOWN INTO HISTORY WITH THE LUSTRE OF GLORY AND SELF SACRIFICE SURROUNDING IT THAT NAME IS EDITH CAVELL EDITH CAVELL WAS BORN AT SWARDESTON IN NORWICH ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE EDITH CAVELL AS THE NAME OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE BECAME WORLD FAMOUS AT THE CLOSE OF THE CRIMEAN WAR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO THE NAME OF ANOTHER ENGLISH NURSE WHO SUFFERED MARTYRDOM IN THE WORLD WAR
OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
WHO WERE LATER TO SLAY HER BRUSSELS BECAME A PART OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE AND A TYRANNICAL GOVERNOR CAME THERE TO ESTABLISH HIS HEADQUARTERS ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS THREATENING THE BELGIANS WITH DEATH FOR MINOR OFFENSES AND FILLING BRUSSELS WITH SPIES AND INTRIGUE
WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
AND WERE TAUGHT THE VALUE OF LEADING USEFUL LIVES AND THE GLORY OF SELF SACRIFICE AS WAS CUSTOMARY AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL SHE RECEIVED HER EDUCATION ON THE CONTINENT ATTENDING SCHOOL IN THE CITY OF BRUSSELS IN BELGIUM
AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
HER FATHER WAS AN ENGLISH MINISTER OF THE OLD SCHOOL WHO WAS RECTOR OF A SINGLE PARISH IN NORWICH FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY EDITH AND HER SISTER WERE BROUGHT UP IN STRICT CONFORMANCE WITH CHURCH IDEAS
AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
A BLOW WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE WHEN SHE TRIED TO EXPOSTULATE SHE WAS TAKEN TO PRISON AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HER ARREST WAS SHROUDED WITH THE MOST CAREFUL SECRECY FOR THE GERMANS DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NEUTRAL GOVERNMENTS
THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL BUT THE GRATING OF HIS FEET AS HE SET THEM ON THE STONES AND THE MOVEMENT NOW AND THEN OF A BIRD IN THE IVY THEN CAME A RUSTLE A GRITTY CLATTER LOUD FALLING STONES HIS FOOT HAD SLIPPED AND HE HAD FALLEN
IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
AND SPOKE OF HER IN MOST ENDEARING LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH ON LEAVING HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO APPRISE HER OF HIS MOVEMENTS FEARING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE SO TO DO HIS FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN TO WHOM HE APPEARED WARMLY ATTACHED
HE LEFT AS HE DID HIS WIFE IN SLAVERY HE DECLARED THAT HE STUCK TO THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD GEORGE E SADLER THE KEEPER OF AN OYSTER HOUSE HELD THE DEED FOR JOE
THUS WHILE THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA ESPECIALLY NEITHER CHARGED NOR ACCEPTED ANYTHING FOR THEIR SERVICES IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT ANY OF THE SOUTHERN AGENTS COULD AFFORD TO DO LIKEWISE
AND THE TRADER TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF HE WOULD GET THEM FINALLY HE TOLD HIM HE WOULD GIVE EVERY CENT THEY WOULD BRING WHICH WOULD BE MUCH OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS THEY WERE SO VERY LIKELY
AND HIS LITTLE NURSE WAS FINALLY REWARDED BY HAVING HER PET GAMBOLLING AROUND HER AS USUAL A CAT SOME TIME AGO RECEIVED A CHARGE OF RAGGED SHOT IN HIS SHOULDER
WHILE THE BRUTAL TRADER WOULD STRAP THEM WITH A BROAD LEATHER STRAP THE STRAP BEING PREFERRED TO THE COW HIDE AS IT WOULD NOT BREAK THE SKIN AND DAMAGE THE SALE ONE HUNDRED LASHES WOULD ONLY BE A COMMON FLOGGING
INDEED HE DID NOT PROFESS TO BRING PERSONS FOR NOTHING EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES
AND A VERY GREAT PET BUT IN A SHORT TIME HE GOT REDUCED TO A MERE BAG OF BONES
WAS IN LIKE MANNER CAUGHT IN A TRAP AND HAD TO ENDURE AMPUTATION OF THE LEG ALTHOUGH IN MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN
AS HAVING BECOME SO DAILY SICK OF THE BRUTALITY AND SUFFERING HE COULD NOT HELP WITNESSING THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAND IT ANY LONGER LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE MET WITH CAPTAIN B
HIS ACCOUNT OF THINGS WAS TOO HARROWING FOR DETAIL HERE EXCEPT IN THE BRIEFEST MANNER AND THAT ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO A FEW PARTICULARS IN ORDER TO PREPARE SLAVES FOR THE MARKET
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS HE CONSIDERED WAS TO SAVE HIS MONEY AND MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO THE CAPTAIN TO HELP HIM SO WHEN HE HAD MANAGED TO LAY BY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILLINGLY OFFERED THIS SUM TO CAPTAIN B
WHEN A FOE MAY POUNCE UPON HER SHE HAS TO SLEEP EVEN WITH OPEN EARS IS IT ANY WONDER THEN THAT WHEN ROUSED FROM SLUMBER BY A CRUEL AND PAINFUL TREAD ON HER TAIL SHE SHOULD START UP
MARY FLED FROM PETERSBURG AND THE ROBINSONS FROM RICHMOND
HE FAINTED FROM LOSS OF BLOOD AND AFTERWARDS HAD HIGH FEVER JUST AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD HAVE DONE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREATER PORTION OF THE SHOT WAS EXTRACTED OR WORKED OUT IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING
THE ANIMAL WAS IN A TREE AND ON THE GENTLEMAN'S APPROACH IT SPRANG DOWN AND COMMENCED RUBBING ROUND HIS LEGS WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS ON BENDING DOWN TO CARESS IT
AS WELL AS WRITING TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JOE AND BOB HAD THE ASSURANCE TO WRITE BACK TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER IN THEIR LETTER THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY IN CANADA AND WERE HAVING GOOD TIMES
HE HOPPED OFF TO THE WOODS AGAIN HE DID NOT RETURN HOWEVER AND FOR TWO YEARS WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN BUT ONE DARK NIGHT HIS MASTER ON PASSING THROUGH A WOOD HAD HIS ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY THE CRIES OF A CAT
THE CAPTAIN AGREED TO THE TERMS AND FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO THE LETTER ABOUT THE FIRST OF MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE MARY WAS PRESENTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SHE WAS OF AGREEABLE MANNERS ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
AND INVARIABLY FROM THAT DATE WHENEVER IT SAW ME IN THE GARDEN IT WOULD COME BOUNDING TO ME AND I AM SURE BY ITS DUMB DELIGHT IT WELL REPAID ME SHOWING THAT IT FULLY APPRECIATED BOTH THE VOICE
ONLY ONE OBSTACLE STOOD IN HIS WAY MATERIAL AID IT OCCURRED TO ROBERT THAT HE HAD FREQUENT ACCESS TO THE MONEY DRAWER AND OFTEN IT CONTAINED THE PROCEEDS OF FRESH SALES OF FLESH AND BLOOD
WHEN LO AND BEHOLD IN TURNING TO THE INTERESTING COLUMN CONTAINING THE ELEGANT ILLUSTRATIONS OF RUNAWAY NEGROES IT WAS SEEN THAT THE UNFORTUNATE SLATER
HOW FAR THE CAPTAIN TALKED APPROVINGLY HE DID NOT EXACTLY TELL THE COMMITTEE BUT THEY GUESSED HE TALKED STRONG DEMOCRATIC DOCTRINE TO THEM UNDER THE FRIGHTFUL CIRCUMSTANCES
AND DOESN'T CARE A RAT'S TAIL HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN A CAT'S COAT BEGINS TO APPEAR ROUGH AND STARE IT IS THE FIRST INDICATION OF APPROACHING ILLNESS AND THIS SYMPTOM
THAT MAKES OUR DOMESTIC CAT SUCH AN EXCELLENT HUNTER AND VERMIN KILLER WE ALL KNOW HOW PATIENTLY SHE WILL SIT IN A CORNER AND WATCH FOR A MOUSE OR RAT SHE KNOWS VERY WELL IT WILL COME SOONER OR LATER
WERE NAMES WHICH STOOD FAIR IN THE EYES OF VIRGINIA CONSEQUENTLY BEING ABLE TO PACK THE FUGITIVES AWAY IN A VERY PRIVATE HOLE OF HIS BOAT AND BEING ONLY BOUND FOR A SOUTHERN PORT THE CAPTAIN WAS WILLING TO RISK HIS SHARE OF THE DANGER
IN THE EATING LINE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THE BEST ALSO HAD VERY CHOICE WINES AND BRANDIES WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THAT THEY TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE A SMACK AT AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A VERY CORDIAL INVITATION TO MAKE THEM A VISIT
ON THE NINTH DAY HE COULD JUST SING ONE BAR AND ON THE TENTH DAY ONLY ONE NOTE THIS CAT HAD A GREAT DISLIKE FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO MILK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE DISPATCH BROUGHT THE NEWS
BUT IN LONG LINGERING ILLNESSES PUSSY IS A MUCH BETTER PATIENT PUSSY MOREOVER IS BLESSED WITH EXTREME GOOD NATURE AND WILL PARDON ALMOST ANY INJURY FROM ONE SHE LOVES
OR SCOTCH CHEESE HE WAS ONCE SENT A DISTANCE OF THIRTY YARDS TRUSSED UP IN THIS FASHION TO A SHOPKEEPER'S PLACE TO BE WEIGHED TUCKER WENT THROUGH THE OPERATION SO PATIENTLY THAT THE GROCER NEVER SUSPECTED
AND EVERY TIME THE POULTICE WAS CHANGED THE CAT LICKED HER HAND IN EVIDENT GRATITUDE IN FACT TOM MADE THE BEST OF PATIENTS BEING MORE LIKE A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE
AND HE REASONED THAT IF SOME OF THAT WOULD HELP HIM AND HIS BROTHER TO FREEDOM THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN HELPING HIMSELF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE CAPTAIN WAS ALL READY AND PROVIDED HE COULD GET THREE PASSENGERS AT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH
SO PITIFUL AN OBJECT LOOKED HE THAT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS HAD THE SIN OF KEEPING HIM ALIVE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THEIR FRIENDS INDEED HE WAS NOW SO WEAK AS TO BE UNABLE TO MOVE
THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT OF HIS ILLNESS HE BEGAN TO RALLY AND SOON GOT WELL AND PLUMP AND SLEEK AND THE OTHER DAY DIED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE BUT IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HOW
AND WOULD BRING ANY KIND OF FREIGHT THAT WOULD PAY THE MOST WAS THE CONDUCTOR IN THIS INSTANCE
ONE PORTION HOWEVER PUSSY CARRIED TO HIS GRAVE WITH HIM DURING THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF HAVING HIS WOUNDS PROBED FOR SHOT
HE MADE A VERY GOOD GRAB HE DID NOT ADMIT THAT THE AMOUNT ADVERTISED WAS CORRECT AFTER A REASONABLE TIME FOR RECRUITING HAVING BEEN SO LONG IN THE HOLE OF THE VESSEL THEY TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE FOR CANADA FROM JOSEPH THE ELDER BROTHER
PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS NEXT TO A CAT'S LOVE FOR CHILDREN IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT OUGHT TO MAKE ONE LOVE HER AND RESPECT HER AS A PET IT IS THE EXTREME PATIENCE
MY BROTHER IS ALSO AT WORK WITH ME AND DOING WELL THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU IN THE WAY OF NEWS THERE IS A MASONIC LODGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND TWO CHURCHES AND SOCIETYS HERE AND SOME OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR BENEFIT
WHICH SHE EVINCES UNDER SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES THE MOST ACUTE WE TALK ABOUT DOGS BEING GAME AND TAKING THEIR DEATH EASY AND SO THEY MOSTLY DO UNDER EXCITEMENT
CAUSED ME TO BE HIRED OUT WITH A HARD FAMILY WHERE I WAS MUCH ABUSED FREQUENTLY FLOGGED AND STINTED FOR FOOD ET CETERA BUT THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM IN THE CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE NOW DELIGHTED HER MIND
OF VERY LITTLE PERSUASION MANAGED TO GET NEAR THIS CAT WAIF AND GIVE IT THE MOUSE THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH IT GOT THEM EVER AFTER SO LONG AS IT WAS IN LIFE
FURTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING WAS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO MANY SLAVES IN CITIES COULD RAISE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A PASSAGE
I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHETHER A CAT IS PROPERLY CARED FOR AND HAS SUFFICIENT FOOD BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER COAT IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO BE HUNGRY OR IS BADLY HOUSED SHE SOON LOSES ALL TASTE IN HERSELF
A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD BOB ESCAPES FROM HIS MASTER A TRADER
AND DOUBTLESS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF BEHAVING HIMSELF HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK HAVING BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES AND HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CRUEL MASTER EACH TIME
AND WILL ASK HIM FOR A PASS TO GO TO A BALL TO NIGHT SLAVE HOLDERS LOVE TO SEE THEIR SLAVES FIDDLING AND DANCING OF NIGHTS AND AS I SHALL BE LEAVING IN A HURRY I WILL TAKE A GRAB FROM THE DAY'S SALE AND WHEN SLATER HEARS OF ME AGAIN I WILL BE IN CANADA
HE WOULD SET SAIL WITHOUT MUCH OTHER FREIGHT OF COURSE HE WAS TOO SHREWD TO GET OUT PAPERS FOR PHILADELPHIA THAT WOULD BETRAY HIM AT ONCE WASHINGTON OR BALTIMORE
THE COMMITTEE RENDERED HER THE USUAL ASSISTANCE AND IN DUE TIME FORWARDED HER ON TO QUEEN VICTORIA'S FREE LAND IN CANADA ON HER ARRIVAL SHE WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS TORONTO MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE THEM GREASED AND RUBBED TO MAKE THEM LOOK BRIGHT AND SHINING AND HE WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES WERE NOT UNCOMMONLY STRIPPED NAKED LASHED FLAT TO A BENCH AND THEN HELD BY TWO MEN SOMETIMES FOUR
AND SEEMED IN NO WAY INCONVENIENCED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS HIND LEG BUT TRAVELLERS NEVER CAN SETTLE AND PUSS TOOK TO THE WOODS AGAIN
TO ANY ONE WHO MAY HAVE FED IT WHEN HUNGRY NOT LONG AGO WRITES A LADY TO ME A CAT ONE OF THE KIND KEPT AS A MACHINE USED TO FREQUENT OUR GARDEN STARVED ENOUGH POOR THING AS ITS KNOTTY FUR BETOKENED
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD HAD BUT FEW PRIVILEGES SUNDAYS AND WEEK DAYS ALIKE HE WAS KEPT PRETTY SEVERELY BENT DOWN TO DUTY HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY HE HAD A WIFE
THAT PUSSY'S PATIENCE IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED A POOR CAT MANY YEARS AGO TOOK A SEVERE ILLNESS JAUNDICE HE WAS A FINE LARGE TOM CAT OF THE NAME OF TACKET
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ROUGH TREATMENT AT BABY HANDS TUCKER WAS ABOUT THE BEST NATURED LUMP OF A CAT I EVER KNEW YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH HIM FLUNG HIM OVER THE CHURCH FOR INSTANCE
BUT YOU'LL REMEMBER YOU'RE UNINVITED OUR LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT HERE CONTAINS A SECRET OR SO IS A KIND OF BLUE BEARD'S CHAMBER IN FACT NOTHING VERY DREADFUL REALLY TO A SANE MAN BUT JUST NOW AS WE DON'T KNOW YOU DECIDEDLY SAID I
SAID HE STUPIDLY AND THEN WITH A LIGHT COMING INTO HIS EYES WHY IT'S MISTER MISTER PRENDICK SAID I PRENDICK BE DAMNED SAID HE SHUT UP THAT'S YOUR NAME MISTER SHUT UP
AT ANY RATE THEY WERE AN AMAZINGLY UGLY GANG AND OVER THE HEADS OF THEM UNDER THE FORWARD LUG PEERED THE BLACK FACE OF THE MAN WHOSE EYES WERE LUMINOUS IN THE DARK AS I STARED AT THEM THEY MET MY GAZE
THE PILE OF THINGS COMPLETED ALL THREE MEN LAID HOLD OF THE TRUCK AND BEGAN SHOVING THE TON WEIGHT OR SO UPON IT AFTER THE PUMA PRESENTLY MONTGOMERY LEFT THEM AND COMING BACK TO ME HELD OUT HIS HAND I'M GLAD SAID HE FOR MY OWN PART
YET SOME OF HIS EXPERIMENTS BY THE JOURNALIST'S ACCOUNT WERE WANTONLY CRUEL HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURCHASED HIS SOCIAL PEACE BY ABANDONING HIS INVESTIGATIONS BUT HE APPARENTLY PREFERRED THE LATTER AS MOST MEN WOULD WHO HAVE ONCE FALLEN UNDER THE OVERMASTERING SPELL OF RESEARCH
WE CAN'T SEND HIM OVER THERE AND WE CAN'T SPARE THE TIME TO BUILD HIM A NEW SHANTY AND WE CERTAINLY CAN'T TAKE HIM INTO OUR CONFIDENCE JUST YET I'M IN YOUR HANDS SAID I
NO SOONER WAS THAT DONE THAN HE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT AND TILTING THE THING ON ONE END TURNED ITS LIVING CONTENTS OUT ON THE GROUND
SAID THE CAPTAIN THEN BEGAN A CURIOUS THREE CORNERED ALTERCATION ALTERNATELY I APPEALED TO ONE AND ANOTHER OF THE THREE MEN FIRST TO THE GREY HAIRED MAN TO LET ME LAND AND THEN TO THE DRUNKEN CAPTAIN TO KEEP ME ABOARD
BUT SO ODD IS THE HUMAN MEMORY THAT I COULD NOT THEN RECALL THAT WELL KNOWN NAME IN ITS PROPER CONNECTION FROM THAT MY THOUGHTS WENT TO THE INDEFINABLE QUEERNESS OF THE DEFORMED MAN ON THE BEACH I NEVER SAW SUCH A GAIT SUCH ODD MOTIONS AS HE PULLED AT THE BOX
AND I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE ISLAND WE WERE APPROACHING IT WAS LOW AND COVERED WITH THICK VEGETATION CHIEFLY A KIND OF PALM THAT WAS NEW TO ME FROM ONE POINT A THIN WHITE THREAD OF VAPOUR ROSE SLANTINGLY TO AN IMMENSE HEIGHT
THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT'S WHAT I MEAN OVERBOARD MISTER SHUT UP AND SHARP WE'RE CLEANING THE SHIP OUT
AS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SECRECY AND BY SOME ODD LEAP IN MY THOUGHTS THE POINTED EARS AND LUMINOUS EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT CAME BACK AGAIN BEFORE ME WITH THE SHARPEST DEFINITION I STARED BEFORE ME OUT AT THE GREEN SEA FROTHING UNDER A FRESHENING BREEZE
THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT WAY ROARED THE CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY AND HIS COMPANION TURNED AS HE SPOKE
AND LET THESE AND OTHER STRANGE MEMORIES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS CHASE ONE ANOTHER THROUGH MY MIND
TO READ WHICH MADE ONE SHIVER AND CREEP THEN I REMEMBERED DISTINCTLY ALL ABOUT IT THAT LONG FORGOTTEN PAMPHLET CAME BACK WITH STARTLING VIVIDNESS TO MY MIND I HAD BEEN A MERE LAD THEN AND MOREAU WAS I SUPPOSE ABOUT FIFTY
I DID NOT TURN MY HEAD TO FOLLOW HER AT FIRST I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DINGEY STUNNED AND STARING BLANKLY AT THE VACANT OILY SEA THEN I REALISED THAT I WAS IN THAT LITTLE HELL OF MINE AGAIN NOW HALF SWAMPED
BUT THE LAUNCH WAS NOW FULLY LADEN AND WAS SHOVED OFF HASTILY A BROADENING GAP OF GREEN WATER APPEARED UNDER ME AND I PUSHED BACK WITH ALL MY STRENGTH TO AVOID FALLING HEADLONG
LOOK HERE I BEGAN TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN THIS SHIP AINT FOR BEASTS AND CANNIBALS AND WORSE THAN BEASTS ANY MORE OVERBOARD YOU GO MISTER SHUT UP
I EVEN BAWLED ENTREATIES TO THE SAILORS MONTGOMERY SAID NEVER A WORD ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU'RE GOING OVERBOARD I TELL YOU WAS THE CAPTAIN'S REFRAIN LAW BE DAMNED I'M KING HERE
FROM HIM MY EYES TRAVELLED TO HIS THREE MEN AND A STRANGE CREW THEY WERE I SAW ONLY THEIR FACES YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES I KNEW NOT WHAT THAT GAVE ME A QUEER SPASM OF DISGUST I LOOKED STEADILY AT THEM
MONTGOMERY STEERED US ROUND AND INTO A NARROW LITTLE DOCK EXCAVATED IN THE BEACH THEN THE MAN ON THE BEACH HASTENED TOWARDS US THIS DOCK AS I CALL IT WAS REALLY A MERE DITCH JUST LONG ENOUGH AT THIS PHASE OF THE TIDE TO TAKE THE LONGBOAT
BUT THE ISLANDERS SEEING THAT I WAS REALLY ADRIFT TOOK PITY ON ME I DRIFTED VERY SLOWLY TO THE EASTWARD APPROACHING THE ISLAND SLANTINGLY AND PRESENTLY I SAW WITH HYSTERICAL RELIEF THE LAUNCH COME ROUND AND RETURN TOWARDS ME
I WAS VERY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE ELABORATE SECRECY OF THESE TWO MEN REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE PLACE AND FOR SOME TIME I WAS THINKING OF THAT AND OF THE UNACCOUNTABLE FAMILIARITY OF THE NAME OF MOREAU
I RUBBED MY EYES AND LAY LISTENING TO THE NOISE DOUBTFUL FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF MY WHEREABOUTS THEN CAME A SUDDEN PATTERING OF BARE FEET THE SOUND OF HEAVY OBJECTS BEING THROWN ABOUT A VIOLENT CREAKING AND THE RATTLING OF CHAINS
AND WHEN THEY DID SPEAK ENDOWED WITH VERY UNCANNY VOICES WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM THEN I RECALLED THE EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S UNGAINLY ATTENDANT JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF HIM HE CAME IN HE WAS NOW DRESSED IN WHITE AND CARRIED A LITTLE TRAY WITH SOME COFFEE AND BOILED VEGETABLES THEREON
AS I CAME UP THE LADDER I SAW AGAINST THE FLUSHED SKY FOR THE SUN WAS JUST RISING THE BROAD BACK AND RED HAIR OF THE CAPTAIN AND OVER HIS SHOULDER THE PUMA SPINNING FROM A TACKLE RIGGED ON TO THE MIZZEN SPANKER BOOM THE POOR BRUTE SEEMED HORRIBLY SCARED
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE AS I FANCIED AS THEY LAID HANDS ON SOME BALES PILED NEAR THE STERN
THERE WERE THREE OTHER MEN BESIDES THREE STRANGE BRUTISH LOOKING FELLOWS AT WHOM THE STAGHOUNDS WERE SNARLING SAVAGELY MONTGOMERY WHO WAS STEERING BROUGHT THE BOAT BY ME AND RISING CAUGHT AND FASTENED MY PAINTER TO THE TILLER TO TOW ME
A MAN STOOD AWAITING US AT THE WATER'S EDGE I FANCIED WHILE WE WERE STILL FAR OFF THAT I SAW SOME OTHER AND VERY GROTESQUE LOOKING CREATURES SCUTTLE INTO THE BUSHES UPON THE SLOPE BUT I SAW NOTHING OF THESE AS WE DREW NEARER
IN THE EARLY MORNING IT WAS THE SECOND MORNING AFTER MY RECOVERY AND I BELIEVE THE FOURTH AFTER I WAS PICKED UP I AWOKE THROUGH AN AVENUE OF TUMULTUOUS DREAMS DREAMS OF GUNS AND HOWLING MOBS AND BECAME SENSIBLE OF A HOARSE SHOUTING ABOVE ME
THROUGH THE WINDOW I SAW ONE OF THOSE UNACCOUNTABLE MEN IN WHITE LUGGING A PACKING CASE ALONG THE BEACH PRESENTLY THE WINDOW FRAME HID HIM THEN I HEARD A KEY INSERTED AND TURNED IN THE LOCK BEHIND ME
IT WAS THE ANTISEPTIC ODOUR OF THE DISSECTING ROOM I HEARD THE PUMA GROWLING THROUGH THE WALL AND ONE OF THE DOGS YELPED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRUCK YET SURELY AND ESPECIALLY TO ANOTHER SCIENTIFIC MAN THERE WAS NOTHING SO HORRIBLE IN VIVISECTION
THE DOGS WERE STILL SNARLING AND STRAINED AT THEIR CHAINS AFTER THESE MEN AS THE WHITE HAIRED MAN LANDED WITH THEM THE THREE BIG FELLOWS SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER IN ODD GUTTURAL TONES AND THE MAN WHO HAD WAITED FOR US ON THE BEACH BEGAN CHATTERING TO THEM EXCITEDLY
I SHOULD BE A FOOL TO TAKE OFFENCE AT ANY WANT OF CONFIDENCE HE TWISTED HIS HEAVY MOUTH INTO A FAINT SMILE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE SATURNINE PEOPLE WHO SMILE WITH THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH DOWN AND BOWED HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF MY COMPLAISANCE
THAT ALTERS THE CASE A LITTLE MISTER PRENDICK HE SAID WITH A TRIFLE MORE RESPECT IN HIS MANNER AS IT HAPPENS WE ARE BIOLOGISTS HERE THIS IS A BIOLOGICAL STATION OF A SORT
AT LAST I MUST CONFESS MY VOICE SUDDENLY BROKE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIGOROUS THREAT I FELT A GUST OF HYSTERICAL PETULANCE AND WENT AFT AND STARED DISMALLY AT NOTHING
THE WHITE HAIRED MAN I FOUND WAS STILL REGARDING ME STEADFASTLY
MAY I ASK WHAT THAT SIGNIFIES I TOLD HIM I HAD SPENT SOME YEARS AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND HAD DONE SOME RESEARCHES IN BIOLOGY UNDER HUXLEY HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS SLIGHTLY AT THAT
AS WE CAME STILL NEARER THIS INDIVIDUAL BEGAN TO RUN TO AND FRO ON THE BEACH MAKING THE MOST GROTESQUE MOVEMENTS AT A WORD OF COMMAND FROM MONTGOMERY THE FOUR MEN IN THE LAUNCH SPRANG UP AND WITH SINGULARLY AWKWARD GESTURES STRUCK THE LUGS
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND FORTHWITH THEY WENT OFF WITH THAT HOPPING RUN OF THEIRS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK UP THE BEACH INCREASE AND MULTIPLY MY FRIENDS SAID MONTGOMERY REPLENISH THE ISLAND HITHERTO WE'VE HAD A CERTAIN LACK OF MEAT HERE
THAT CAPTAIN WAS A SILLY ASS HE'D HAVE MADE THINGS LIVELY FOR YOU IT WAS YOU SAID I THAT SAVED ME AGAIN THAT DEPENDS YOU'LL FIND THIS ISLAND AN INFERNALLY RUM PLACE I PROMISE YOU I'D WATCH MY GOINGS CAREFULLY
THAT HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM THE BEACH THEY WERE NOT BARKING BUT SNIFFING AND GROWLING IN A CURIOUS FASHION I COULD HEAR THE RAPID PATTER OF THEIR FEET AND MONTGOMERY'S VOICE SOOTHING THEM
IT WAS A HEAVY WOODEN GATE FRAMED IN IRON AND LOCKED WITH THE CARGO OF THE LAUNCH PILED OUTSIDE IT AND AT THE CORNER WE CAME TO A SMALL DOORWAY I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THE WHITE HAIRED MAN PRODUCED A BUNDLE OF KEYS FROM THE POCKET OF HIS GREASY BLUE JACKET
HE HAD A LARGE ALMOST LIPLESS MOUTH EXTRAORDINARY LANK ARMS LONG THIN FEET AND BOW LEGS AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAVY FACE THRUST FORWARD STARING AT US HE WAS DRESSED LIKE MONTGOMERY AND HIS WHITE HAIRED COMPANION IN JACKET AND TROUSERS OF BLUE SERGE
I FELT ALL THE WRETCHEDER FOR THE LACK OF A BREAKFAST HUNGER AND A LACK OF BLOOD CORPUSCLES TAKE ALL THE MANHOOD FROM A MAN I PERCEIVED PRETTY CLEARLY THAT I HAD NOT THE STAMINA EITHER TO RESIST WHAT THE CAPTAIN CHOSE TO DO TO EXPEL ME
BUT HIS EYES HAD THAT ODD DROOPING OF THE SKIN ABOVE THE LIDS WHICH OFTEN COMES WITH ADVANCING YEARS AND THE FALL OF HIS HEAVY MOUTH AT THE CORNERS GAVE HIM AN EXPRESSION OF PUGNACIOUS RESOLUTION HE TALKED TO MONTGOMERY IN A TONE TOO LOW FOR ME TO HEAR
AND AS I DID SO BY SOME ODD TRICK OF UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION THERE CAME SURGING INTO MY HEAD THE PHRASE THE MOREAU HOLLOWS WAS IT THE MOREAU AH IT SENT MY MEMORY BACK TEN YEARS THE MOREAU HORRORS
THE DOCTOR WAS SIMPLY HOWLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IT MAY BE THAT HE DESERVED TO BE BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE TEPID SUPPORT OF HIS FELLOW INVESTIGATORS AND HIS DESERTION BY THE GREAT BODY OF SCIENTIFIC WORKERS WAS A SHAMEFUL THING
AS IF I DID NOT EXIST PRESENTLY THAT WORK WAS FINISHED AND THEN CAME A STRUGGLE I WAS HAULED RESISTING WEAKLY ENOUGH TO THE GANGWAY EVEN THEN I NOTICED THE ODDNESS OF THE BROWN FACES OF THE MEN WHO WERE WITH MONTGOMERY IN THE LAUNCH
AND A SMALL UNGLAZED WINDOW DEFENDED BY AN IRON BAR LOOKED OUT TOWARDS THE SEA THIS THE WHITE HAIRED MAN TOLD ME WAS TO BE MY APARTMENT AND THE INNER DOOR WHICH FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTS HE SAID HE WOULD LOCK ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS MY LIMIT INWARD
THE PHRASE DRIFTED LOOSE IN MY MIND FOR A MOMENT
TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE PRESENTLY THE WHITE HAIRED MAN SEEMED TO RECOLLECT MY PRESENCE AND CAME UP TO ME YOU LOOK SAID HE AS THOUGH YOU HAD SCARCELY BREAKFASTED
THE WHITE HAIRED MAN WHO I KNEW WAS A GOOD SIX FEET IN HEIGHT SAT A HEAD BELOW ANY ONE OF THE THREE I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT REALLY NONE WERE TALLER THAN MYSELF BUT THEIR BODIES WERE ABNORMALLY LONG AND THE THIGH PART OF THE LEG SHORT AND CURIOUSLY TWISTED
I FOLLOWED THE LLAMA UP THE BEACH AND WAS OVERTAKEN BY MONTGOMERY WHO ASKED ME NOT TO ENTER THE STONE ENCLOSURE I NOTICED THEN THAT THE PUMA IN ITS CAGE AND THE PILE OF PACKAGES HAD BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO THIS QUADRANGLE
ALMOST LIKE HORSEHAIR AND SEEMED AS THEY SAT
THEN SUDDENLY HIS CAREER WAS CLOSED HE HAD TO LEAVE ENGLAND A JOURNALIST OBTAINED ACCESS TO HIS LABORATORY IN THE CAPACITY OF LABORATORY ASSISTANT
IF I WERE YOU HE HE HESITATED AND SEEMED TO ALTER HIS MIND ABOUT WHAT WAS ON HIS LIPS I WISH YOU'D HELP ME WITH THESE RABBITS HE SAID HIS PROCEDURE WITH THE RABBITS WAS SINGULAR I WADED IN WITH HIM AND HELPED HIM LUG ONE OF THE HUTCHES ASHORE
AND THE IMPRESSION DID NOT PASS THOUGH I FAILED TO SEE WHAT HAD OCCASIONED IT THEY SEEMED TO ME THEN TO BE BROWN MEN
BROAD SHOULDERED COMPANION SITTING CRAMPED UP WITH THE DOGS AND SEVERAL PACKING CASES IN THE STERN SHEETS THIS INDIVIDUAL STARED FIXEDLY AT ME WITHOUT MOVING OR SPEAKING THE BLACK FACED CRIPPLE WAS GLARING AT ME AS FIXEDLY IN THE BOWS NEAR THE PUMA
THE BEST COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE IS TO HAVE OPENNESS IN FAME AND OPINION SECRECY IN HABIT DISSIMULATION IN SEASONABLE USE AND A POWER TO FEIGN IF THERE BE NO REMEDY
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS UNFIT BUT CHIEFLY LET THE MUSIC OF THEM BE RECREATIVE AND WITH SOME STRANGE CHANGES SOME SWEET ODORS SUDDENLY COMING FORTH WITHOUT ANY DROPS FALLING ARE
THEREFORE LET A MAN EITHER AVOID THE OCCASION ALTOGETHER OR PUT HIMSELF OFTEN TO IT THAT HE MAY BE LITTLE MOVED WITH IT A MAN'S NATURE IS BEST PERCEIVED IN PRIVATENESS FOR THERE IS NO AFFECTATION
LET HIM SEASONABLY WATER THE ONE AND DESTROY THE OTHER
BECAUSE THEIR MEANS ARE LESS EXHAUST YET ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE MORE CRUEL AND HARDHEARTED GOOD TO MAKE SEVERE INQUISITORS BECAUSE THEIR TENDERNESS IS NOT SO OFT CALLED UPON
HAVE SOME MOTIONS UPON THE SCENE ITSELF BEFORE THEIR COMING DOWN FOR IT DRAWS THE EYE STRANGELY AND MAKES IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO DESIRE TO SEE THAT IT CANNOT PERFECTLY DISCERN
THEREFORE IT IS THE WEAKER SORT OF POLITICS THAT ARE THE GREAT DISSEMBLERS TACITUS SAITH LIVIA SORTED WELL WITH THE ARTS OF HER HUSBAND AND DISSIMULATION OF HER SON ATTRIBUTING ARTS OR POLICY TO AUGUSTUS
WHICH PRICK AND SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN DO NO OTHER THE MOST TOLERABLE SORT OF REVENGE
WHICH SEEMETH NOT TO BE WITHOUT MYSTERY NAY AND TO HAVE SOME APPROACH TO THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN THAT HERCULES WHEN HE WENT TO UNBIND PROMETHEUS BY WHOM HUMAN NATURE IS REPRESENTED
A WISE SON REJOICETH THE FATHER BUT AN UNGRACIOUS SON SHAMES THE MOTHER A MAN SHALL SEE WHERE THERE IS A HOUSE FULL OF CHILDREN ONE OR TWO OF THE ELDEST RESPECTED AND THE YOUNGEST MADE WANTONS BUT IN THE MIDST
REVENGE IS A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE WHICH THE MORE MAN'S NATURE RUNS TO THE MORE OUGHT LAW TO WEED IT OUT FOR AS FOR THE FIRST WRONG IT DOTH BUT OFFEND THE LAW
AND DISSIMULATION TO TIBERIUS
AND IT BE BUT FOR HER DAUGHTERS CONFIDENCE AND REPUTATION FOR THOSE TWO FELICITY BREEDETH THE FIRST WITHIN A MAN'S SELF THE LATTER IN OTHERS TOWARDS HIM ALL WISE MEN TO DECLINE THE ENVY OF THEIR OWN VIRTUES
IN PASSION FOR THAT PUTTETH A MAN OUT OF HIS PRECEPTS AND IN A NEW CASE OR EXPERIMENT FOR THERE CUSTOM LEAVETH HIM THEY ARE HAPPY MEN WHOSE NATURES SORT WITH THEIR VOCATIONS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SAY
FOR NATURE WILL LAY BURIED A GREAT TIME AND YET REVIVE UPON THE OCCASION OR TEMPTATION LIKE AS IT WAS WITH A ESOP'S DAMSEL TURNED FROM A CAT TO A WOMAN WHO SAT VERY DEMURELY AT THE BOARD'S END TILL A MOUSE RAN BEFORE HER
THE SPANISH NAME DESEMBOLTURA PARTLY EXPRESSETH THEM WHEN THERE BE NOT STONDS NOR RESTIVENESS IN A MAN'S NATURE BUT THAT THE WHEELS OF HIS MIND KEEP WAY WITH THE WHEELS OF HIS FORTUNE
FOR WHERE A MAN'S INTENTIONS ARE PUBLISHED IT IS AN ALARUM TO CALL UP ALL THAT ARE AGAINST THEM THE SECOND IS TO RESERVE TO A MAN'S SELF A FAIR RETREAT FOR IF A MAN ENGAGE HIMSELF BY A MANIFEST DECLARATION
IT FOLLOWETH MANY TIMES UPON SECRECY BY A NECESSITY SO THAT HE THAT WILL BE SECRET MUST BE A DISSEMBLER IN SOME DEGREE FOR MEN ARE TOO CUNNING TO SUFFER A MAN TO KEEP AN INDIFFERENT CARRIAGE BETWEEN BOTH
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE HORSES WELL MANAGED FOR THEY COULD TELL PASSING WELL WHEN TO STOP OR TURN AND AT SUCH TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE CASE INDEED REQUIRED DISSIMULATION IF THEN THEY USED IT IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FORMER OPINION SPREAD ABROAD
SAILED THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT OCEAN IN AN EARTHEN POT OR PITCHER LIVELY DESCRIBING CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION THAT SAILETH IN THE FRAIL BARK OF THE FLESH THROUGH THE WAVES OF THE WORLD BUT TO SPEAK IN A MEAN
AND ASSUREDLY THE SECRET MAN HEARETH MANY CONFESSIONS FOR WHO WILL OPEN HIMSELF TO A BLAB OR A BABBLER BUT IF A MAN BE THOUGHT SECRET IT INVITETH DISCOVERY AS THE MORE CLOSE AIR SUCKETH IN THE MORE OPEN
ARE AFTER AS THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND THEREFORE AS MACHIAVEL WELL NOTETH THOUGH IN AN EVIL FAVORED INSTANCE THERE IS NO TRUSTING TO THE FORCE OF NATURE NOR TO THE BRAVERY OF WORDS EXCEPT IT BE CORROBORATE BY CUSTOM
BUT AFTER A TIME LET HIM PRACTISE WITH DISADVANTAGES AS DANCERS DO WITH THICK SHOES FOR IT BREEDS GREAT PERFECTION IF THE PRACTICE BE HARDER THAN THE USE WHERE NATURE IS MIGHTY AND THEREFORE THE VICTORY HARD
HE MUST GO THROUGH OR TAKE A FALL THE THIRD IS THE BETTER TO DISCOVER THE MIND OF ANOTHER FOR TO HIM THAT OPENS HIMSELF MEN WILL HARDLY SHOW THEMSELVES ADVERSE BUT WILL FAIR LET HIM GO ON AND TURN THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH I HERE SET DOWN ARE SUCH AS DO NATURALLY TAKE THE SENSE AND NOT RESPECT PETTY WONDERMENTS IT IS TRUE THE ALTERATIONS OF SCENES SO IT BE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT NOISE ARE THINGS OF GREAT BEAUTY AND PLEASURE
THE FRENCH HATH IT BETTER ENTREPRENANT OR REMUANT BUT THE EXERCISED FORTUNE MAKETH THE ABLE MAN FORTUNE IS TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED
WHICH CARRIETH THE GREATER BENEDICTION AND THE CLEARER REVELATION OF GOD'S FAVOR YET EVEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IF YOU LISTEN TO DAVID'S HARP YOU SHALL HEAR AS MANY HEARSE LIKE AIRS AS CAROLS AND THE PENCIL OF THE HOLY GHOST
IN OTHER THINGS THE PREDOMINANCY OF CUSTOM IS EVERYWHERE VISIBLE INSOMUCH AS A MAN WOULD WONDER TO HEAR MEN PROFESS PROTEST ENGAGE GIVE GREAT WORDS AND THEN DO JUST AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE
NEVER PROSPERED IN ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK AFTERWARDS CERTAINLY THERE BE WHOSE FORTUNES ARE LIKE HOMER'S VERSES THAT HAVE A SLIDE AND EASINESS MORE THAN THE VERSES OF OTHER POETS
AND WHAT TO BE SHOWED AT HALF LIGHTS AND TO WHOM AND WHEN WHICH INDEED ARE ARTS OF STATE AND ARTS OF LIFE AS TACITUS WELL CALLETH THEM TO HIM A HABIT OF DISSIMULATION IS A HINDERANCE AND A POORNESS
HE SHALL AS WELL PRACTISE HIS ERRORS AS HIS ABILITIES AND INDUCE ONE HABIT OF BOTH AND THERE IS NO MEANS TO HELP THIS BUT BY SEASONABLE INTERMISSIONS BUT LET NOT A MAN TRUST HIS VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE TOO FAR
LET THE SUITS OF THE MASQUERS BE GRACEFUL AND SUCH AS BECOME THE PERSON WHEN THE VIZORS ARE OFF NOT AFTER EXAMPLES OF KNOWN ATTIRES TURKE SOLDIERS MARINERS AND THE LIKE
LET NOT A MAN FORCE A HABIT UPON HIMSELF WITH A PERPETUAL CONTINUANCE BUT WITH SOME INTERMISSION FOR BOTH THE PAUSE REINFORCETH THE NEW ONSET AND IF A MAN THAT IS NOT PERFECT BE EVER IN PRACTICE
NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
THE WAY OF FORTUNE IS LIKE THE MILKEN WAY IN THE SKY WHICH IS A MEETING OR KNOT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL STARS NOT SEEN ASUNDER BUT GIVING LIGHT TOGETHER
IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE AFFECTION OR APTNESS OF THE CHILDREN BE EXTRAORDINARY THEN IT IS GOOD NOT TO CROSS IT BUT GENERALLY THE PRECEPT IS GOOD OPTIMUM
THERE ARE SOME FOOLISH RICH COVETOUS MEN THAT TAKE A PRIDE IN HAVING NO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THOUGHT SO MUCH THE RICHER FOR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD SOME TALK SUCH AN ONE IS A GREAT RICH MAN
FOR THEY FEED AND RELIEVE THE EYE BEFORE IT BE FULL OF THE SAME OBJECT LET THE SCENES ABOUND WITH LIGHT SPECIALLY COLORED AND VARIED AND LET THE MASQUERS OR ANY OTHER
OF ADVERSITY IT WAS AN HIGH SPEECH OF SENECA AFTER THE MANNER OF THE STOICS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WHICH BELONG TO PROSPERITY ARE TO BE WISHED BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT BELONG TO ADVERSITY ARE TO BE ADMIRED
SHOULD HAVE GREATEST CARE OF FUTURE TIMES UNTO WHICH THEY KNOW THEY MUST TRANSMIT THEIR DEAREST PLEDGES SOME THERE ARE WHO THOUGH THEY LEAD A SINGLE LIFE
FOR COMMONWEALTHS AND GOOD GOVERNMENTS DO NOURISH VIRTUE GROWN BUT DO NOT MUCH MEND THE DEEDS BUT THE MISERY IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS ARE NOW APPLIED TO THE ENDS LEAST TO BE DESIRED
FOR THE FIRST WILL MAKE HIM DEJECTED BY OFTEN FAILINGS AND THE SECOND WILL MAKE HIM A SMALL PROCEEDER THOUGH BY OFTEN PREVAILINGS AND AT THE FIRST LET HIM PRACTISE WITH HELPS AS SWIMMERS DO WITH BLADDERS OR RUSHES
BUT YET SINCE PRINCES WILL HAVE SUCH THINGS IT IS BETTER THEY SHOULD BE GRACED WITH ELEGANCY THAN DAUBED WITH COST DANCING TO SONG IS A THING OF GREAT STATE AND PLEASURE I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE SONG BE IN QUIRE
BUT OF THEIR WORK AND SO BOTH CHILDREN AND CREATURES THE DIFFERENCE IN AFFECTION OF PARENTS TOWARDS THEIR SEVERAL CHILDREN IS MANY TIMES UNEQUAL AND SOMETIMES UNWORTHY ESPECIALLY IN THE MOTHERS AS SOLOMON SAITH
BUT YOU NEVER READ THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR FRIENDS BUT YET THE SPIRIT OF JOB WAS IN A BETTER TUNE
IN CREATING AND BREEDING AN EMULATION BETWEEN BROTHERS DURING CHILDHOOD WHICH MANY TIMES SORTETH TO DISCORD WHEN THEY ARE MEN AND DISTURBETH FAMILIES
AS PLUTARCH SAITH OF TIMOLEON'S FORTUNE IN RESPECT OF THAT OF
TILL THEY BE ENGAGED WITH HARD ICE MANY EXAMPLES MAY BE PUT OF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM BOTH UPON MIND AND BODY THEREFORE SINCE CUSTOM IS THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATE OF MAN'S LIFE
PORTAS ET FORTUNAM EJUS SO SYLLA CHOSE THE NAME OF FELIX AND NOT OF MAGNUS AND IT HATH BEEN NOTED THAT THOSE WHO ASCRIBE OPENLY TOO MUCH TO THEIR OWN WISDOM AND POLICY
AND ANOTHER EXCEPT TO IT YEA BUT HE HATH A GREAT CHARGE OF CHILDREN AS IF IT WERE AN ABATEMENT TO HIS RICHES BUT THE MOST ORDINARY CAUSE OF A SINGLE LIFE IS LIBERTY
ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN SELF PLEASING AND HUMOROUS MINDS WHICH ARE SO SENSIBLE OF EVERY RESTRAINT AS THEY WILL GO NEAR TO THINK THEIR GIRDLES AND GARTERS TO BE BONDS AND SHACKLES UNMARRIED MEN ARE BEST FRIENDS
WHO MANY TIMES NEVERTHELESS PROVE THE BEST THE ILLIBERALITY OF PARENTS IN ALLOWANCE TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN IS AN HARMFUL ERROR MAKES THEM BASE ACQUAINTS THEM WITH SHIFTS MAKES THEM SORT WITH MEAN COMPANY
AND AS IN CONFESSION THE REVEALING IS NOT FOR WORLDLY USE BUT FOR THE EASE OF A MAN'S HEART SO SECRET MEN COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS IN THAT KIND WHILE MEN RATHER DISCHARGE THEIR MINDS THAN IMPART THEIR MINDS
OF THEIR GOOD FAITH AND CLEARNESS OF DEALING MADE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE THERE BE THREE DEGREES OF THIS HIDING AND VEILING OF A MAN'S SELF THE FIRST CLOSENESS RESERVATION AND SECRECY
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM COPULATE AND CONJOINED AND COLLEGIATE IS FAR GREATER FOR THERE EXAMPLE TEACHETH COMPANY COMFORTETH EMULATION QUICKENETH GLORY RAISETH SO AS IN SUCH PLACES
A TRIFLE MORE OF THAT MAN HE WOULD SAY AND I SHALL EXPLODE WE HAD SOME HEAVY WEATHER
WE WERE ALL HARD AT WORK CHANGING THE POWDER AND THE BERTHS WHEN THE LAST MAN OR TWO AND LONG JOHN ALONG WITH THEM CAME OFF IN A SHORE BOAT
WELL GENTLEMEN CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS THIS MAP BUT I MAKE IT A POINT IT SHALL BE KEPT SECRET EVEN FROM ME AND MISTER ARROW
EVEN AT THAT EXCITING MOMENT IT CARRIED ME BACK TO THE OLD ADMIRAL BENBOW IN A SECOND AND I SEEMED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CAPTAIN PIPING IN THE CHORUS
AND TO MAKE A GARRISON OF THE STERN PART OF THE SHIP MANNED WITH MY FRIEND'S OWN PEOPLE AND PROVIDED WITH ALL THE ARMS AND POWDER ON BOARD IN OTHER WORDS YOU FEAR A MUTINY
PIECES OF EIGHT PIECES OF EIGHT TILL YOU WONDERED THAT IT WAS NOT OUT OF BREATH OR TILL JOHN THREW HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE CAGE NOW THAT BIRD HE WOULD SAY
EVEN HE PERHAPS HAD BEEN DOUBTFUL AS TO THE CREW BUT THAT IS ONLY GUESS FOR AS YOU SHALL HEAR WE HAD NOT LONG THE BENEFIT OF HIS OPINION
WHO WAS STANDING BY WITH HIS CRUTCH UNDER HIS ARM AND AT ONCE BROKE OUT IN THE AIR AND WORDS I KNEW SO WELL FIFTEEN MEN ON THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST
SECOND POINT ANY MORE ASKED MISTER TRELAWNEY ONE MORE SAID THE CAPTAIN THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH BLABBING ALREADY
CRIED THE SQUIRE IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER WHO IT WAS REPLIED THE DOCTOR AND I COULD SEE THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE CAPTAIN PAID MUCH REGARD TO MISTER TRELAWNEY'S PROTESTATIONS
THE CAPTAIN HAS SAID TOO MUCH OR HE HAS SAID TOO LITTLE AND I'M BOUND TO SAY THAT I REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION OF HIS WORDS YOU DON'T YOU SAY LIKE THIS CRUISE NOW WHY
BUT BEFORE WE CAME THE LENGTH OF TREASURE ISLAND TWO OR THREE THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHICH REQUIRE TO BE KNOWN MISTER ARROW FIRST OF ALL
AND TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK HE DISAPPEARED AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS GALLEY THAT'S A GOOD MAN CAPTAIN SAID THE DOCTOR VERY LIKELY SIR REPLIED CAPTAIN SMOLLETT
THAT VOYAGE IN DETAIL IT WAS FAIRLY PROSPEROUS THE SHIP PROVED TO BE A GOOD SHIP THE CREW WERE CAPABLE SEAMEN AND THE CAPTAIN THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD HIS BUSINESS
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT BEGAN THE DOCTOR WITH A SMILE DID EVER YOU HEAR THE FABLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MOUSE YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I DARE SAY
AND SURINAM AND PROVIDENCE AND PORTOBELLO SHE WAS AT THE FISHING UP OF THE WRECKED PLATE SHIPS IT'S THERE SHE LEARNED PIECES OF EIGHT AND LITTLE WONDER
WHEN I CAME IN HERE I MEANT TO GET DISCHARGED I HAD NO THOUGHT THAT MISTER TRELAWNEY WOULD HEAR A WORD NO MORE I WOULD CRIED THE SQUIRE
COME AWAY HAWKINS HE WOULD SAY COME AND HAVE A YARN WITH JOHN NOBODY MORE WELCOME THAN YOURSELF MY SON SIT YOU DOWN AND HEAR THE NEWS
EASY WITH THAT MEN EASY HE RAN ON TO THE FELLOWS WHO WERE SHIFTING THE POWDER AND THEN SUDDENLY OBSERVING ME EXAMINING THE SWIVEL WE CARRIED AMIDSHIPS A LONG BRASS NINE
STAND BY TO GO ABOUT THE PARROT WOULD SCREAM AH SHE'S A HANDSOME CRAFT SHE IS THE COOK WOULD SAY AND GIVE HER SUGAR FROM HIS POCKET
THAT THERE'S CROSSES ON THE MAP TO SHOW WHERE TREASURE IS AND THAT THE ISLAND LIES AND THEN HE NAMED THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE EXACTLY
HIM UNARMED ALL THE CREW RESPECTED AND EVEN OBEYED HIM HE HAD A WAY OF TALKING TO EACH AND DOING EVERYBODY SOME PARTICULAR SERVICE
BUT SOON THE ANCHOR WAS SHORT UP SOON IT WAS HANGING DRIPPING AT THE BOWS SOON THE SAILS BEGAN TO DRAW AND THE LAND AND SHIPPING TO FLIT BY ON EITHER SIDE
NEITHER DID I TO BE SURE HE WAS SO LOOSE A TALKER YET IN THIS CASE I BELIEVE HE WAS REALLY RIGHT AND THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD THE SITUATION OF THE ISLAND
DOUBLE GROG WAS GOING ON THE LEAST EXCUSE THERE WAS DUFF ON ODD DAYS AS FOR INSTANCE IF THE SQUIRE HEARD IT WAS ANY MAN'S BIRTHDAY AND ALWAYS A BARREL OF APPLES STANDING BROACHED IN THE WAIST
ARE YOU DETERMINED TO GO ON THIS CRUISE LIKE IRON ANSWERED THE SQUIRE VERY GOOD SAID THE CAPTAIN THEN AS YOU'VE HEARD ME VERY PATIENTLY
POWDER AND ARMS THE HISPANIOLA LAY SOME WAY OUT AND WE WENT UNDER THE FIGUREHEADS AND ROUND THE STERNS OF MANY OTHER SHIPS
SAYING THINGS THAT I COULD NOT PROVE HEAR ME A FEW WORDS MORE THEY ARE PUTTING THE POWDER AND THE ARMS IN THE FORE HOLD NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD PLACE UNDER THE CABIN WHY NOT PUT THEM THERE
IN I GOT BODILY INTO THE APPLE BARREL AND FOUND THERE WAS SCARCE AN APPLE LEFT BUT SITTING DOWN THERE IN THE DARK
BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT AT THIS RATE HE MUST SOON KILL HIMSELF OUTRIGHT SO NOBODY WAS MUCH SURPRISED NOR VERY SORRY WHEN ONE DARK NIGHT
WHAT WITH THE SOUND OF THE WATERS AND THE ROCKING MOVEMENT OF THE SHIP I HAD EITHER FALLEN ASLEEP OR WAS ON THE POINT OF DOING SO WHEN A HEAVY MAN SAT DOWN WITH RATHER A CLASH CLOSE BY
WITH A HEAD SEA HE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY AND WAS SEEN NO MORE OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN WELL GENTLEMEN
HE HAD GOOD SCHOOLING IN HIS YOUNG DAYS AND CAN SPEAK LIKE A BOOK WHEN SO MINDED AND BRAVE A LION'S NOTHING ALONGSIDE OF LONG JOHN I SEEN HIM GRAPPLE FOUR AND KNOCK THEIR HEADS TOGETHER
MY ORDERS SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY YOU MAY GO BELOW MY MAN HANDS WILL WANT SUPPER AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED THE COOK
IS MAYBE TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD HAWKINS THEY LIVE FOREVER MOSTLY AND IF ANYBODY'S SEEN MORE WICKEDNESS IT MUST BE THE DEVIL HIMSELF
AND BOATFULS OF THE SQUIRE'S FRIENDS MISTER BLANDLY AND THE LIKE COMING OFF TO WISH HIM A GOOD VOYAGE AND A SAFE RETURN WE NEVER HAD A NIGHT AT THE ADMIRAL BENBOW WHEN I HAD HALF THE WORK
I'LL HAVE NO FAVOURITES ON MY SHIP I ASSURE YOU I WAS QUITE OF THE SQUIRE'S WAY OF THINKING AND HATED THE CAPTAIN DEEPLY
ALL SHIPSHAPE AND SEAWORTHY WELL SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN BETTER SPEAK PLAIN I BELIEVE EVEN AT THE RISK OF OFFENCE I DON'T LIKE THIS CRUISE
NOT HAVING SEEN HER TRIED SAID THE CAPTAIN SHE SEEMS A CLEVER CRAFT MORE I CAN'T SAY POSSIBLY SIR YOU MAY NOT LIKE YOUR EMPLOYER EITHER SAYS THE SQUIRE
TO ME HE WAS UNWEARIEDLY KIND AND ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE ME IN THE GALLEY WHICH HE KEPT AS CLEAN AS A NEW PIN THE DISHES HANGING UP BURNISHED AND HIS PARROT IN A CAGE IN ONE CORNER
BUT I'LL TELL YOU MY WAY OF IT LIFE OR DEATH AND A CLOSE RUN THAT IS ALL CLEAR AND I DARE SAY TRUE ENOUGH REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY WE TAKE THE RISK
FAR TOO MUCH AGREED THE DOCTOR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'VE HEARD MYSELF CONTINUED CAPTAIN SMOLLETT THAT YOU HAVE A MAP OF AN ISLAND
THAT SAVES THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING HIM IN IRONS BUT THERE WE WERE WITHOUT A MATE AND IT WAS NECESSARY OF COURSE TO ADVANCE ONE OF THE MEN THE BOATSWAIN
BUT YOU SMELT POWDER
HERE YOU SHIP'S BOY HE CRIED OUT O THAT OFF WITH YOU TO THE COOK AND GET SOME WORK AND THEN AS I WAS HURRYING OFF I HEARD HIM SAY QUITE LOUDLY TO THE DOCTOR
AND JOHN WOULD TOUCH HIS FORELOCK WITH A SOLEMN WAY HE HAD THAT MADE ME THINK HE WAS THE BEST OF MEN
NOW BARBECUE TIP US A STAVE CRIED ONE VOICE THE OLD ONE CRIED ANOTHER AYE AYE MATES SAID LONG JOHN
AND JOHN SILVER SILVER IF YOU LIKE CRIED THE SQUIRE BUT AS FOR THAT INTOLERABLE HUMBUG I DECLARE I THINK HIS CONDUCT UNMANLY UNSAILORLY
TURNED OUT EVEN WORSE THAN THE CAPTAIN HAD FEARED HE HAD NO COMMAND AMONG THE MEN AND PEOPLE DID WHAT THEY PLEASED WITH HIM BUT THAT WAS BY NO MEANS THE WORST OF IT
HE HAD TAKEN A DOWNRIGHT FANCY TO HER SHE'LL LIE A POINT NEARER THE WIND THAN A MAN HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT OF HIS OWN MARRIED WIFE SIR BUT HE WOULD ADD ALL I SAY IS
BECAUSE WE WERE NOW SO NEAR AN END OF THE FIRST PART OF OUR ADVENTURE
JOB ANDERSON WAS THE LIKELIEST MAN ABOARD AND THOUGH HE KEPT HIS OLD TITLE HE SERVED IN A WAY AS MATE MISTER TRELAWNEY HAD FOLLOWED THE SEA AND HIS KNOWLEDGE MADE HIM VERY USEFUL
NEXT SAID THE CAPTAIN I LEARN WE ARE GOING AFTER TREASURE HEAR IT FROM MY OWN HANDS MIND YOU NOW TREASURE IS TICKLISH WORK
AND BEFORE I HAD HEARD A DOZEN WORDS I WOULD NOT HAVE SHOWN MYSELF FOR ALL THE WORLD BUT LAY THERE
AND THEN THE BIRD WOULD PECK AT THE BARS AND SWEAR STRAIGHT ON PASSING BELIEF FOR WICKEDNESS THERE JOHN WOULD ADD YOU CAN'T TOUCH PITCH AND NOT BE MUCKED LAD
NO OTHER THAN A GREAT SHIP'S KETTLE OF IRON WITH THE BOTTOM KNOCKED OUT AND SUNK TO HER BEARINGS AS THE CAPTAIN SAID AMONG THE SAND LITTLE HAD BEEN LEFT BESIDES THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HOUSE
AND THAT POOR OLD TOM REDRUTH STILL UNBURIED LAY ALONG THE WALL STIFF AND STARK UNDER THE UNION JACK IF WE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SIT IDLE
I HEARD SOMEONE SAY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER WITH A CRY OF SURPRISE SILVER HIMSELF
IF WE CAN COME TO TERMS AND NO BONES ABOUT IT ALL I ASK IS YOUR WORD CAP'N SMOLLETT TO LET ME SAFE AND SOUND OUT OF THIS HERE STOCKADE AND ONE MINUTE TO GET OUT O SHOT BEFORE A GUN IS FIRED MY MAN
I SLEPT LIKE A LOG OF WOOD THE REST HAD LONG BEEN UP AND HAD ALREADY BREAKFASTED AND INCREASED THE PILE OF FIREWOOD BY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AGAIN WHEN I WAS WAKENED BY A BUSTLE AND THE SOUND OF VOICES FLAG OF TRUCE
IT'S ALWAYS A SHIP AND THEY CAN GET TO BUCCANEERING AGAIN I SUPPOSE
AND YOU WON'T FORGET MY WORDS A PRECIOUS SIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SAY A PRECIOUS SIGHT MORE CONFIDENCE' AND THEN NIPS HIM AND HE PINCHED ME THE THIRD TIME WITH THE SAME AIR OF CLEVERNESS
AND KNOCKED OUT THE ASHES OF HIS PIPE IN THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND IS THAT ALL HE ASKED EVERY LAST WORD BY THUNDER
AND I HOPE RAISING HIS VOICE THAT ALL HANDS IN THIS HERE BLOCK HOUSE WILL OVERHAUL MY WORDS FOR WHAT IS SPOKE TO ONE IS SPOKE TO ALL CAPTAIN SMOLLETT ROSE FROM HIS SEAT
INDEED I HAD ALREADY DESERTED MY EASTERN LOOPHOLE AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD NOW SEATED HIMSELF ON THE THRESHOLD
IT WAS STILL QUITE EARLY
A MAN WHO HAS BEEN THREE YEARS BITING HIS NAILS ON A DESERT ISLAND JIM CAN'T EXPECT TO APPEAR AS SANE AS YOU OR ME IT DOESN'T LIE IN HUMAN NATURE WAS IT CHEESE YOU SAID HE HAD A FANCY FOR YES SIR CHEESE
ONLY WHERE THE STREAMLET RAN DOWN FROM THE KETTLE
DON'T KNOW HIM WHO'S HE CRIED THE CAPTAIN AND WE COULD HEAR HIM ADDING TO HIMSELF CAP'N IS IT MY HEART AND HERE'S PROMOTION LONG JOHN ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF ME SIR
THE DOCTOR STAKED HIS WIG THAT CAMPED WHERE THEY WERE IN THE MARSH AND UNPROVIDED WITH REMEDIES
SEVERELY WOUNDED IF HE WERE NOT DEAD EVERY TIME WE HAD A CRACK AT THEM WE WERE TO TAKE IT
SO HE ADDED
AND HERE THEY ARE ASHORE IN THE OLD STOCKADE AS WAS MADE YEARS AND YEARS AGO BY FLINT AH HE WAS THE MAN TO HAVE A HEADPIECE WAS FLINT BARRING RUM HIS MATCH WERE NEVER SEEN HE WERE AFRAID OF NONE NOT HE
SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU WISH TO TALK TO ME YOU CAN COME THAT'S ALL IF THERE'S ANY TREACHERY IT'LL BE ON YOUR SIDE AND THE LORD HELP YOU
FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE PORRIDGE BEGINNING TO BOIL OUR CHIMNEY WAS A SQUARE HOLE IN THE ROOF
NARRATIVE RESUMED BY JIM HAWKINS THE GARRISON IN THE STOCKADE
STOPPED ME BY THE ARM AND SAT DOWN NOW SAID HE THERE'S YOUR FRIENDS SURE ENOUGH FAR MORE LIKELY IT'S THE MUTINEERS I ANSWERED THAT HE CRIED
THE SUN HAD JUST SET THE SEA BREEZE WAS RUSTLING AND TUMBLING IN THE WOODS AND RUFFLING THE GREY SURFACE OF THE ANCHORAGE THE TIDE TOO WAS FAR OUT AND GREAT TRACTS OF SAND LAY UNCOVERED THE AIR AFTER THE HEAT OF THE DAY
NOW RESUMED SILVER HERE IT IS YOU GIVE US THE CHART TO GET THE TREASURE BY
HE CRIED THIS TIME IT WAS THE OTHER MAN WHO REPLIED CAP'N SILVER SIR TO COME ON BOARD AND MAKE TERMS HE SHOUTED
THAT'S FOR BEN GUNN BEFORE SUPPER WAS EATEN WE BURIED OLD TOM IN THE SAND AND STOOD ROUND HIM FOR A WHILE BARE HEADED IN THE BREEZE A GOOD DEAL OF FIREWOOD HAD BEEN GOT IN BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE CAPTAIN'S FANCY
I KNOW A GENTLEMAN AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT WE COULD SEE THE MAN WHO CARRIED THE FLAG OF TRUCE ATTEMPTING TO HOLD SILVER BACK NOR WAS THAT WONDERFUL SEEING HOW CAVALIER HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN'S ANSWER
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY MY MAN BETTER SAY IT SAID THE CAPTAIN RIGHT YOU WERE CAP'N SMOLLETT REPLIED SILVER DOOTY IS DOOTY TO BE SURE WELL NOW YOU LOOK HERE
SILVER'S EMBASSY SURE ENOUGH THERE WERE TWO MEN JUST OUTSIDE THE STOCKADE ONE OF THEM WAVING A WHITE CLOTH THE OTHER NO LESS A PERSON THAN SILVER HIMSELF STANDING PLACIDLY BY
I WOULD SET NO LIMITS TO WHAT GENTLEMEN MIGHT CONSIDER SHIPSHAPE OR MIGHT NOT AS THE CASE WERE
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEANT TO DO AND WE DON'T CARE FOR NOW YOU SEE YOU CAN'T DO IT AND THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AT HIM CALMLY AND PROCEEDED TO FILL A PIPE
THAT WAS A GOOD LAY OF YOURS LAST NIGHT I DON'T DENY IT WAS A GOOD LAY
THESE POOR LADS HAVE CHOSEN ME CAP'N AFTER YOUR DESERTION SIR LAYING A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS UPON THE WORD DESERTION WE'RE WILLING TO SUBMIT
AND HE FILLED A PIPE AND LIGHTED IT AND THE TWO MEN SAT SILENTLY SMOKING FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW LOOKING EACH OTHER IN THE FACE NOW STOPPING THEIR TOBACCO NOW LEANING FORWARD TO SPIT IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE PLAY TO SEE THEM
DOCTOR HERE'S MY SERVICE WHY
I ANSWERED WELL JIM SAYS HE
AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD OVER IT AND TOLD US WE MUST GET BACK TO THIS TOMORROW RATHER LIVELIER THEN WHEN WE HAD EATEN OUR PORK AND EACH HAD A GOOD STIFF GLASS OF BRANDY GROG THE THREE CHIEFS GOT TOGETHER IN A CORNER TO DISCUSS OUR PROSPECTS
SOME OF MY HANDS BEING ROUGH AND HAVING OLD SCORES ON ACCOUNT OF HAZING
WELL HERE IT IS SAID SILVER WE WANT THAT TREASURE AND WE'LL HAVE IT THAT'S OUR POINT YOU WOULD JUST AS SOON SAVE YOUR LIVES I RECKON AND THAT'S YOURS YOU HAVE A CHART HAVEN'T YOU
SO THERE'S MY MIND FOR YOU MY MAN ON THAT THIS LITTLE WHIFF OF TEMPER SEEMED TO COOL SILVER DOWN HE HAD BEEN GROWING NETTLED BEFORE BUT NOW HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER LIKE ENOUGH SAID HE
THE SLOPES OF THE KNOLL AND ALL THE INSIDE OF THE STOCKADE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF TIMBER TO BUILD THE HOUSE AND WE COULD SEE BY THE STUMPS WHAT A FINE AND LOFTY GROVE HAD BEEN DESTROYED
AND STOVING OF THEIR HEADS IN WHILE ASLEEP YOU DO THAT AND WE'LL OFFER YOU A CHOICE
WHISTLED THROUGH EVERY CHINK OF THE RUDE BUILDING AND SPRINKLED THE FLOOR WITH A CONTINUAL RAIN OF FINE SAND THERE WAS SAND IN OUR EYES SAND IN OUR TEETH SAND IN OUR SUPPERS SAND DANCING IN THE SPRING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE KETTLE
WHOM I HAD SEEN SO GLOOMY SHOUTING AT THE OARS LIKE CHILDREN BUT THERE WAS A SOUND IN THEIR VOICES WHICH SUGGESTED RUM AT LENGTH I THOUGHT I MIGHT RETURN TOWARDS THE STOCKADE
I MOVED FROM HIDING PLACE TO HIDING PLACE ALWAYS PURSUED OR SO IT SEEMED TO ME BY THESE TERRIFYING MISSILES BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOMBARDMENT
TIRED THOUGH WE ALL WERE TWO WERE SENT OUT FOR FIREWOOD TWO MORE WERE SET TO DIG A GRAVE FOR REDRUTH THE DOCTOR WAS NAMED COOK I WAS PUT SENTRY AT THE DOOR
SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT I WAS DEAD TIRED AS YOU MAY FANCY AND WHEN I GOT TO SLEEP
WHY IN A PLACE LIKE THIS WHERE NOBODY PUTS IN BUT GEN'LEMEN OF FORTUNE SILVER WOULD FLY THE JOLLY ROGER YOU DON'T MAKE NO DOUBT OF THAT NO THAT'S YOUR FRIENDS THERE'S BEEN BLOWS TOO AND I RECKON YOUR FRIENDS HAS HAD THE BEST OF IT
AND WITH GREAT VIGOUR AND SKILL SUCCEEDED IN SURMOUNTING THE FENCE AND DROPPING SAFELY TO THE OTHER SIDE I WILL CONFESS THAT I WAS FAR TOO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON TO BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE AS SENTRY
BUT I'LL TELL YOU I WAS SOBER I WAS ON'Y DOG TIRED AND IF I'D AWOKE A SECOND SOONER I'D A CAUGHT YOU AT THE ACT I WOULD HE WASN'T DEAD WHEN I GOT ROUND TO HIM NOT HE WELL
BEN GUNN'S LAST WORDS CAME BACK TO MY MIND I BEGAN TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD PAID THE BUCCANEERS A VISIT WHILE THEY ALL LAY DRUNK TOGETHER ROUND THEIR FIRE AND I RECKONED UP WITH GLEE THAT WE HAD ONLY FOURTEEN ENEMIES TO DEAL WITH
A CHILL THAT PIERCED INTO THE MARROW THE SKY WAS BRIGHT AND CLOUDLESS OVERHEAD AND THE TOPS OF THE TREES SHONE ROSILY IN THE SUN BUT WHERE SILVER STOOD WITH HIS LIEUTENANT
THERE AIN'T A PARTICLE OF SERVICE IN THAT AND YOU MAY LAY TO IT WHAT I MEAN IS WE WANT YOUR CHART NOW I NEVER MEANT YOU NO HARM MYSELF THAT WON'T DO WITH ME MY MAN INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN
JIM THE EAST GRAY WEST THE WATCH BELOW ALL HANDS TO LOAD MUSKETS LIVELY MEN AND CAREFUL AND THEN HE TURNED AGAIN TO THE MUTINEERS AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH YOUR FLAG OF TRUCE
YOU HAVE I KNOW THAT RETURNED LONG JOHN
SAYS CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AS COOL AS CAN BE ALL THAT SILVER SAID WAS A RIDDLE TO HIM BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT FROM HIS TONE AS FOR ME I BEGAN TO HAVE AN INKLING
NOT I RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
IT APPEARS THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END WHAT TO DO THE STORES BEING SO LOW THAT WE MUST HAVE BEEN STARVED INTO SURRENDER LONG BEFORE HELP CAME BUT OUR BEST HOPE IT WAS DECIDED WAS TO KILL OFF THE BUCCANEERS
MAYBE ALL WAS SHOOK MAYBE I WAS SHOOK MYSELF MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE FOR TERMS BUT YOU MARK ME CAP'N IT WON'T DO TWICE BY THUNDER
AND I'LL SEE YOU ALL TO DAVY JONES YOU CAN'T FIND THE TREASURE YOU CAN'T SAIL THE SHIP THERE'S NOT A MAN AMONG YOU FIT TO SAIL THE SHIP
AND HIM THAT COMES IS TO HAVE A WHITE THING IN HIS HAND AND HE'S TO COME ALONE OH AND YOU'LL SAY THIS BEN GUNN SAYS YOU HAS REASONS OF HIS OWN WELL SAID I I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND
HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND HIS EYES FIXED ON THE WATER AS IT BUBBLED OUT OF THE OLD IRON KETTLE IN THE SAND HE WAS WHISTLING COME LASSES AND LADS SILVER HAD TERRIBLE HARD WORK GETTING UP THE KNOLL
THEN HE HAILED THE BUCCANEER WHO GOES STAND OR WE FIRE FLAG OF TRUCE CRIED SILVER THE CAPTAIN WAS IN THE PORCH KEEPING HIMSELF CAREFULLY OUT OF THE WAY OF A TREACHEROUS SHOT
AND I SHOULD KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ONE
THE POOR JOLLY BOAT I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED AWAY NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER A GREAT FIRE WAS GLOWING AMONG THE TREES AND BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THE SHIP ONE OF THE GIGS KEPT COMING AND GOING THE MEN
AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WELL THEN STILL HOLDING ME I RECKON YOU CAN GO JIM AND JIM IF YOU WAS TO SEE SILVER YOU WOULDN'T GO FOR TO SELL BEN GUNN
THE CHILL AND THE VAPOUR TAKEN TOGETHER TOLD A POOR TALE OF THE ISLAND IT WAS PLAINLY A DAMP FEVERISH UNHEALTHY SPOT KEEP INDOORS MEN SAID THE CAPTAIN TEN TO ONE THIS IS A TRICK
NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE TWO WERE TALKING
WERE ONLY TO BE EXCEEDED BY THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN
AND NOW IT SEEMS SO IMPROPER I I I'M SO ASHAMED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF ME I SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH IMPROPER SHE MANAGED TO EXCLAIM UNLADY LIKE YOU CAN NEVER THINK WELL OF ME
HERE'S THE TURKEY HALLO WHOOP HOW ARE YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS IT WAS A TURKEY HE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS THAT BIRD
THEN WITH THE TEA TRAY STILL HELD STRAIGHT BEFORE HER THE LITTLE DRESSMAKER EXCLAIMED TEARFULLY OH I DIDN'T MEAN I DIDN'T MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THIS I ONLY MEANT TO BE KIND AND BRING YOU SOME TEA
WITH THE BRUSQUE RESOLVE AND INTREPIDITY THAT SOMETIMES SEIZES UPON VERY TIMID PEOPLE THE COURAGE OF THE COWARD GREATER THAN ALL OTHERS SHE HAD PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE OLD ENGLISHMAN'S HALF OPEN DOOR AND WHEN HE HAD NOT HEEDED HER KNOCK HAD PUSHED IT OPEN
FOLDING ONE OF HIS BED CURTAINS IN HIS ARMS THEY ARE NOT TORN DOWN RINGS AND ALL THEY ARE HERE I AM HERE THE SHADOWS OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAY BE DISPELLED THEY WILL BE I KNOW THEY WILL
CARRYING A CUP OF TEA ON A TINY JAPANESE TRAY SHE HELD IT TOWARD HIM I WAS MAKING SOME TEA SHE SAID AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CUP NEVER AFTER COULD THE LITTLE DRESSMAKER UNDERSTAND HOW SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF TO DO THIS THING
THE GERANIUMS BLOOMING IN THE STARCH BOXES IN THE WINDOW THE AGED GOLDFISH OCCASIONALLY TURNING HIS IRIDESCENT FLANK TO CATCH A SUDDEN GLOW OF THE SETTING SUN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN ALL TREPIDATION
SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HOLD THE TRAY OUT ANOTHER INSTANT ALREADY SHE WAS TREMBLING SO THAT HALF THE TEA WAS SPILLED OLD GRANNIS STILL KEPT SILENCE STILL BENDING FORWARD WITH WIDE EYES HIS HANDS GRIPPING THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR
AND SHAVING REQUIRES ATTENTION EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T DANCE WHILE YOU ARE AT IT
DRAWING UP A CHAIR AND SITTING DOWN NO I THE FACT IS I'VE SOLD MY APPARATUS A FIRM OF BOOKSELLERS HAS BOUGHT THE RIGHTS OF IT AND AREN'T YOU GOING TO BIND BOOKS ANY MORE EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE DRESSMAKER A SHADE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER MANNER
FOR THIRTY YEARS HIS EYES HAD NOT BEEN WET BUT TONIGHT HE FELT AS IF HE WERE YOUNG AGAIN HE HAD NEVER LOVED BEFORE AND THERE WAS STILL A PART OF HIM THAT WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER HE WAS PROFOUNDLY SAD OR DEEPLY HAPPY
AND BEEN QUITE SATISFIED HE DRESSED HIMSELF ALL IN HIS BEST AND AT LAST GOT OUT INTO THE STREETS THE PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME POURING FORTH AS HE HAD SEEN THEM WITH THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND WALKING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN

THE TEARS THAT SWAM IN HIS FADED BLUE EYES WERE NOT ALTOGETHER THOSE OF UNHAPPINESS NO THIS LONG DELAYED AFFECTION THAT HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS LATER YEARS FILLED HIM WITH A JOY FOR WHICH TEARS SEEMED TO BE THE NATURAL EXPRESSION
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS SAID SCROOGE

THOSE WERE THE BLITHEST IN HIS EARS HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN COMING ON TOWARDS HIM HE BEHELD THE PORTLY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD WALKED INTO HIS COUNTING HOUSE THE DAY BEFORE AND SAID SCROOGE AND MARLEY'S I BELIEVE
AND AT LAST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS STOOD UPON THE THRESHOLD OF HIS ROOM SHE HAD FOUND COURAGE ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN HER INTRUSION I WAS MAKING SOME TEA AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CUP OLD GRANNIS DROPPED HIS HANDS UPON EITHER ARM OF HIS CHAIR
THE BOY WAS OFF LIKE A SHOT HE MUST HAVE HAD A STEADY HAND AT A TRIGGER WHO COULD HAVE GOT A SHOT OFF HALF AS FAST I'LL SEND IT TO BOB CRATCHIT'S WHISPERED SCROOGE RUBBING HIS HANDS AND SPLITTING WITH A LAUGH HE SHAN'T KNOW WHO SENDS IT

SCROOGE REGARDED EVERY ONE WITH A DELIGHTED SMILE HE LOOKED SO IRRESISTIBLY PLEASANT IN A WORD THAT THREE OR FOUR GOOD HUMOURED FELLOWS SAID GOOD MORNING SIR A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND SCROOGE SAID OFTEN AFTERWARDS THAT OF ALL THE BLITHE SOUNDS HE HAD EVER HEARD
RETURNED THE BOY DO YOU KNOW THE POULTERER'S IN THE NEXT STREET BUT ONE AT THE CORNER SCROOGE INQUIRED I SHOULD HOPE I DID REPLIED THE LAD AN INTELLIGENT BOY SAID SCROOGE A REMARKABLE BOY
IT SENT A PANG ACROSS HIS HEART TO THINK HOW THIS OLD GENTLEMAN WOULD LOOK UPON HIM WHEN THEY MET BUT HE KNEW WHAT PATH LAY STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND HE TOOK IT MY DEAR SIR SAID SCROOGE QUICKENING HIS PACE AND TAKING THE OLD GENTLEMAN BY BOTH HIS HANDS
THE MINUTES PASSED SIDE BY SIDE AND SEPARATED BY ONLY A COUPLE OF INCHES OF BOARD THE TWO OLD PEOPLE SAT THERE TOGETHER WHILE THE AFTERNOON GREW DARKER BUT FOR OLD GRANNIS ALL WAS DIFFERENT THAT EVENING THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO
BUT LIVED UPON THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLE EVER AFTERWARDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF HIM THAT HE KNEW HOW TO KEEP CHRISTMAS WELL IF ANY MAN ALIVE POSSESSED THE KNOWLEDGE
SO CLOSE IN FACT THAT HE COULD HEAR MISS BAKER'S GRENADINE BRUSHING AGAINST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THIN PARTITION AT HIS VERY ELBOW WHILE SHE ROCKED GENTLY BACK AND FORTH A CUP OF TEA IN HER HANDS OLD GRANNIS'S OCCUPATION WAS GONE
HER FUNNY LITTLE FALSE CURLS TREMBLED WITH HER AGITATION WHAT SHE HAD DONE SEEMED TO HER INDECOROUS BEYOND EXPRESSION IT WAS AN ENORMITY FANCY SHE HAD GONE INTO HIS ROOM INTO HIS ROOM MISTER GRANNIS'S ROOM
BOTH OF HIS HANDS WERE OCCUPIED WITH THE TRAY HE COULD NOT MAKE A PLACE FOR IT ON THE TABLE HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT UNCERTAIN HIS EMBARRASSMENT RETURNING OH WON'T YOU WON'T YOU PLEASE HE TURNED HIS HEAD LOOKING APPEALINGLY AT THE LITTLE OLD DRESSMAKER
YOU HAVE NO IDEA ALL THESE YEARS LIVING SO CLOSE TO YOU I I HE PAUSED SUDDENLY IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE BEATING OF HIS HEART WAS CHOKING HIM I THOUGHT YOU WERE BINDING YOUR BOOKS TO NIGHT SAID MISS BAKER SUDDENLY
YOU WILL YOU MUST THINK ILL OF ME SHE STOOD IN THE HALL THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS AND SHE HAD NO FREE HAND TO DRY THEM LET ME I'LL TAKE THE TRAY FROM YOU CRIED OLD GRANNIS COMING FORWARD A TREMULOUS JOY CAME UPON HIM

IT WAS TO COME GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE INSTEAD OF AS NOW ABRUPTLY AND WITH NO PREPARATION THAT SHE SHOULD PERMIT HERSELF THE INDISCRETION OF ACTUALLY INTRUDING HERSELF INTO HIS ROOM HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS OCCURRED TO HER YET HERE SHE WAS IN HIS ROOM
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING I'M QUITE A BABY NEVER MIND I DON'T CARE I'D RATHER BE A BABY HALLO WHOOP HALLO HERE HE WAS CHECKED IN HIS TRANSPORTS BY THE CHURCHES RINGING OUT THE LUSTIEST PEALS HE HAD EVER HEARD

AND LEANING FORWARD A LITTLE LOOKED AT HER BLANKLY HE DID NOT SPEAK THE RETIRED DRESSMAKER'S COURAGE HAD CARRIED HER THUS FAR NOW IT DESERTED HER AS ABRUPTLY AS IT HAD COME HER CHEEKS BECAME SCARLET
NO FOG NO MIST CLEAR BRIGHT JOVIAL STIRRING COLD COLD PIPING FOR THE BLOOD TO DANCE TO GOLDEN SUNLIGHT HEAVENLY SKY SWEET FRESH AIR MERRY BELLS OH GLORIOUS GLORIOUS
AND YOU LOOKED TIRED I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED TIRED WHEN I LAST SAW YOU AND A CUP OF TEA YOU KNOW IT THAT THAT DOES YOU SO MUCH GOOD WHEN YOU'RE TIRED BUT YOU WEREN'T BINDING BOOKS NO NO RETURNED OLD GRANNIS
AS HE STOOD THERE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL THE KNOCKER CAUGHT HIS EYE I SHALL LOVE IT AS LONG AS I LIVE CRIED SCROOGE PATTING IT WITH HIS HAND I SCARCELY EVER LOOKED AT IT BEFORE WHAT AN HONEST EXPRESSION IT HAS IN ITS FACE IT'S A WONDERFUL KNOCKER
HE CRIED WITH A SUDDEN SHARP BREATH OH YOU ARE KIND I I YOU HAVE HAVE MADE ME VERY HAPPY NO NO EXCLAIMED MISS BAKER READY TO SOB IT WAS UNLADY LIKE
THE ABSENCE OF HIS ACCUSTOMED WORK SEEMED TO LEAVE SOMETHING OUT OF HIS LIFE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT HE COULD BE THE SAME TO MISS BAKER NOW THEIR LITTLE HABITS WERE DISARRANGED THEIR CUSTOMS BROKEN UP HE COULD NO LONGER FANCY HIMSELF SO NEAR TO HER
BOB TREMBLED AND GOT A LITTLE NEARER TO THE RULER HE HAD A MOMENTARY IDEA OF KNOCKING SCROOGE DOWN WITH IT HOLDING HIM AND CALLING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT FOR HELP AND A STRAIT WAISTCOAT A MERRY CHRISTMAS BOB SAID SCROOGE
ANTIGONE WAS AS BRIGHT AN EXAMPLE OF FILIAL AND SISTERLY FIDELITY AS WAS ALCESTIS OF CONNUBIAL DEVOTION SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF OEDIPUS AND JOCASTA WHO WITH ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS WERE THE VICTIMS OF AN UNRELENTING FATE
AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING A LARGE GRAY CAT SPRANG ON THE HALL FLOOR
BENEATH THE EARTH NOW IN DEEP DARKNESS HID WORN AS THOU WERT WITH AGE TO ME THOU STILL WAST DEAR AND SHALT BE EVER FRANCKLIN'S SOPHOCLES PENELOPE
AND GET NO FAME FROM THE CONTEST WITH ME
VANQUISHED IN THIS FORM I TRIED WHAT ALONE REMAINED TO ME AND ASSUMED THE FORM OF A BULL HE GRASPED MY NECK WITH HIS ARM
SHOULD DECIDE THEIR QUARREL BY SINGLE COMBAT THEY FOUGHT AND FELL BY EACH OTHER'S HANDS
PROFFERED HERSELF AS THE SUBSTITUTE ADMETUS FOND AS HE WAS OF LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE SUBMITTED TO RECEIVE IT AT SUCH A COST BUT THERE WAS NO REMEDY THE CONDITION IMPOSED BY THE FATES HAD BEEN MET AND THE DECREE WAS IRREVOCABLE ALCESTIS SICKENED AS ADMETUS REVIVED
HER HUSBAND'S FATHER SHE PLEDGED HERSELF TO MAKE HER CHOICE AMONG THE SUITORS WHEN THE ROBE WAS FINISHED DURING THE DAY SHE WORKED AT THE ROBE BUT IN THE NIGHT SHE UNDID THE WORK OF THE DAY
UNMOVED BY THE DISSUADING COUNSEL OF AN AFFECTIONATE BUT TIMID SISTER AND UNABLE TO PROCURE ASSISTANCE SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE HAZARD AND TO BURY THE BODY WITH HER OWN HANDS SHE WAS DETECTED IN THE ACT AND CREON GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURIED ALIVE
BECAME VERY FERTILE AND THIS IS MEANT BY THE HORN OF PLENTY THERE IS ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE CORNUCOPIA JUPITER AT HIS BIRTH WAS COMMITTED BY HIS MOTHER RHEA TO THE CARE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MELISSEUS A CRETAN KING THEY FED THE INFANT DEITY WITH THE MILK OF THE GOAT
WHO LIKES TO TELL OF HIS DEFEATS YET I WILL NOT HESITATE TO RELATE MINE COMFORTING MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF THE GREATNESS OF MY CONQUEROR
ALAS I ONLY WISHED I MIGHT HAVE DIED WITH MY POOR FATHER WHEREFORE SHOULD I ASK FOR LONGER LIFE O I WAS FOND OF MISERY WITH HIM E'EN WHAT WAS MOST UNLOVELY GREW BELOVED WHEN HE WAS WITH ME O MY DEAREST FATHER
HE DECLARED THAT VICTORY SHOULD FALL TO THEBES IF MENOECEUS
WHICH FURNISHED AMPLE MATERIALS FOR THE EPIC AND TRAGIC POETS OF GREECE
AS AN OFFSET TO THE WEAKNESS OF ERIPHYLE
WHEN THE RIVER SWELLED IT MADE ITSELF ANOTHER CHANNEL THUS ITS HEAD WAS HORNED HERCULES PREVENTED THE RETURN OF THESE PERIODICAL OVERFLOWS BY EMBANKMENTS AND CANALS AND THEREFORE HE WAS SAID TO HAVE VANQUISHED THE RIVER GOD AND CUT OFF HIS HORN FINALLY THE LANDS FORMERLY SUBJECT TO OVERFLOW BUT NOW REDEEMED
ON ARRIVING THEY ENTERED THE CITY AND SEEING A LARGE PALACE BEFORE THEM WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN THEY WENT IN AND FOUND A NUMBER OF MEN OF PRODIGIOUS STATURE SITTING ON BENCHES IN THE HALL GOING FURTHER THEY CAME BEFORE THE KING UTGARD LOKI WHOM THEY SALUTED WITH GREAT RESPECT
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO MAKE A SECOND DRAUGHT OF IT BUT WHEN HE SET THE HORN DOWN AND LOOKED IN HE COULD SCARCELY PERCEIVE THAT THE LIQUOR WAS DIMINISHED AFTER TAKING BREATH THOR WENT TO IT AGAIN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT WHEN HE TOOK THE HORN FROM HIS MOUTH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD DRUNK RATHER LESS THAN BEFORE
ANTIGONE
DURING HIS LONG ABSENCE AND WHEN IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE STILL LIVED AND HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT HE WOULD EVER RETURN PENELOPE WAS IMPORTUNED BY NUMEROUS SUITORS FROM WHOM THERE SEEMED NO REFUGE BUT IN CHOOSING ONE OF THEM FOR HER HUSBAND PENELOPE HOWEVER
AND AS THE GIANT SOON WAKED UP THOR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIMPLY ASKING HIS NAME MY NAME IS SKRYMIR SAID THE GIANT BUT I NEED NOT ASK THY NAME FOR I KNOW THAT THOU ART THE GOD THOR BUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY GLOVE
AND DEPENDENTS FANCIED THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE BUT IT WAS NOT SO BRAVE WARRIORS WHO WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE PERILLED THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR PRINCE SHRUNK FROM THE THOUGHT OF DYING FOR HIM ON THE BED OF SICKNESS
ALTHOUGH THE HORN COULD NOW BE CARRIED WITHOUT SPILLING HOW NOW THOR SAID UTGARD LOKI THOU MUST NOT SPARE THYSELF IF THOU MEANEST TO DRAIN THE HORN AT THE THIRD DRAUGHT THOU MUST PULL DEEPLY
IN SOME FEAT OR OTHER EXCEL ALL OTHER MEN THE FEAT THAT I KNOW SAID LOKI IS TO EAT QUICKER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND IN THIS I AM READY TO GIVE A PROOF AGAINST ANY ONE HERE WHO MAY CHOOSE TO COMPETE WITH ME
MY KNEES WERE ON THE EARTH AND MY MOUTH IN THE DUST FINDING THAT I WAS NO MATCH FOR HIM IN THE WARRIOR'S ART I RESORTED TO OTHERS AND GLIDED AWAY IN THE FORM OF A SERPENT I CURLED MY BODY IN A COIL AND HISSED AT HIM WITH MY FORKED TONGUE HE SMILED SCORNFULLY AT THIS AND SAID
WITH THAT HE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME AND I WAS ASHAMED AFTER WHAT I HAD SAID TO YIELD I THREW OFF MY GREEN VESTURE AND PRESENTED MYSELF FOR THE STRUGGLE HE TRIED TO THROW ME NOW ATTACKING MY HEAD NOW MY BODY MY BULK WAS MY PROTECTION AND HE ASSAILED ME IN VAIN
THE KING REGARDING THEM WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE SAID IF I DO NOT MISTAKE ME THAT STRIPLING YONDER MUST BE THE GOD THOR THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THOR HE SAID PERHAPS THOU MAYST BE MORE THAN THOU APPEAREST TO BE
I HAVE HEARD YOU WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT I AM NOT A MAN OF SMALL DIMENSIONS
THIS COLLAR OR NECKLACE WAS A PRESENT WHICH VULCAN HAD GIVEN TO HARMONIA ON HER MARRIAGE WITH CADMUS AND POLYNICES HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM ON HIS FLIGHT FROM THEBES ERIPHYLE COULD NOT RESIST SO TEMPTING A BRIBE AND BY HER DECISION THE WAR WAS RESOLVED ON AND AMPHIARAUS WENT TO HIS CERTAIN FATE
THE RIVER GOD ACHELOUS TOLD THE STORY OF ERISICHTHON TO THESEUS AND HIS COMPANIONS WHOM HE WAS ENTERTAINING AT HIS HOSPITABLE BOARD WHILE THEY WERE DELAYED ON THEIR JOURNEY BY THE OVERFLOW OF HIS WATERS HAVING FINISHED HIS STORY HE ADDED
AMPHRYSOS ADMETUS WAS A SUITOR WITH OTHERS FOR THE HAND OF ALCESTIS THE DAUGHTER OF PELIAS WHO PROMISED HER TO HIM
THE CUPBEARER HAVING PRESENTED IT TO THOR UTGARD LOKI SAID WHOEVER IS A GOOD DRINKER WILL EMPTY THAT HORN AT A SINGLE DRAUGHT THOUGH MOST MEN MAKE TWO OF IT BUT THE MOST PUNY DRINKER CAN DO IT IN THREE THOR LOOKED AT THE HORN WHICH SEEMED OF NO EXTRAORDINARY SIZE THOUGH SOMEWHAT LONG
WHO SHOULD COME FOR HER IN A CHARIOT DRAWN BY LIONS AND BOARS THIS TASK ADMETUS PERFORMED BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS DIVINE HERDSMAN AND WAS MADE HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF ALCESTIS BUT ADMETUS FELL ILL
BUT WE MUST NOT OMIT TO RECORD THE FIDELITY
THOR THEN PERCEIVED THAT WHAT THEY HAD TAKEN OVERNIGHT FOR A HALL WAS THE GIANT'S GLOVE AND THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS HAD SOUGHT REFUGE WAS THE THUMB SKRYMIR THEN PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD TRAVEL IN COMPANY AND THOR CONSENTING THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT THEIR BREAKFAST AND WHEN THEY HAD DONE
BUT TOWARDS MIDNIGHT WERE ALARMED BY AN EARTHQUAKE WHICH SHOOK THE WHOLE EDIFICE THOR RISING UP CALLED ON HIS COMPANIONS TO SEEK WITH HIM A PLACE OF SAFETY ON THE RIGHT THEY FOUND AN ADJOINING CHAMBER INTO WHICH THE OTHERS ENTERED BUT THOR REMAINED AT THE DOORWAY WITH HIS MALLET IN HIS HAND
I HAVE MADE USE OF SIMILAR ILLUSIONS IN THE CONTESTS YOU HAVE HAD WITH MY FOLLOWERS IN THE FIRST LOKI
RESOLVED THAT IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING A THIRD BLOW IT SHOULD SETTLE ALL MATTERS BETWEEN THEM
BUT WHY SHOULD I TELL OF OTHER PERSONS TRANSFORMATIONS WHEN I MYSELF AM AN INSTANCE OF THE POSSESSION OF THIS POWER SOMETIMES I BECOME A SERPENT AND SOMETIMES A BULL WITH HORNS ON MY HEAD
AND SOUGHT A UNION WITH HER THE MEANING IS THAT THE RIVER IN ITS WINDINGS FLOWED THROUGH PART OF DEJANIRA'S KINGDOM
ONE DAY THE GOD THOR WITH HIS SERVANT THIALFI AND ACCOMPANIED BY LOKI SET OUT ON A JOURNEY TO THE GIANT'S COUNTRY THIALFI WAS OF ALL MEN THE SWIFTEST OF FOOT HE BORE THOR'S WALLET CONTAINING THEIR PROVISIONS
UNABLE TO AVERT HER FATE WOULD NOT SURVIVE HER AND FELL BY HIS OWN HAND
AND WAS DRIVEN FORTH FROM HIS KINGDOM THEBES DREADED AND ABANDONED BY ALL MEN AS AN OBJECT OF DIVINE VENGEANCE ANTIGONE HIS DAUGHTER ALONE SHARED HIS WANDERINGS AND REMAINED WITH HIM TILL HE DIED AND THEN RETURNED TO THEBES HER BROTHERS
AND BEING NEAR TO DEATH APOLLO PREVAILED ON THE FATES TO SPARE HIM ON CONDITION THAT SOME ONE WOULD CONSENT TO DIE IN HIS STEAD ADMETUS IN HIS JOY AT THIS REPRIEVE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE RANSOM AND PERHAPS REMEMBERING THE DECLARATIONS OF ATTACHMENT WHICH HE HAD OFTEN HEARD FROM HIS COURTIERS
ULYSSES AND PENELOPE HAD NOT ENJOYED THEIR UNION MORE THAN A YEAR
THEY CANNOT IN THE COURSE OF NATURE LIVE MUCH LONGER AND WHO CAN FEEL LIKE THEM THE CALL TO RESCUE THE LIFE THEY GAVE FROM AN UNTIMELY END BUT THE PARENTS DISTRESSED THOUGH THEY WERE AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIM SHRUNK FROM THE CALL THEN ALCESTIS WITH A GENEROUS SELF DEVOTION
HE FOUND THE GIANT HAD TIED IT UP SO TIGHT HE COULD NOT UNTIE A SINGLE KNOT AT LAST THOR BECAME WROTH AND GRASPING HIS MALLET WITH BOTH HANDS HE STRUCK A FURIOUS BLOW ON THE GIANT'S HEAD
POLYNICES KNOWING THIS GAVE ERIPHYLE THE COLLAR OF HARMONIA
ADJUDGED THAT LOKI WAS VANQUISHED UTGARD LOKI THEN ASKED WHAT FEAT THE YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THOR COULD PERFORM
FOR A TIME WE STOPPED THEN RETURNED TO THE CONFLICT WE EACH KEPT OUR POSITION DETERMINED NOT TO YIELD FOOT TO FOOT I BENDING OVER HIM CLENCHING HIS HAND IN MINE WITH MY FOREHEAD ALMOST TOUCHING HIS THRICE HERCULES TRIED TO THROW ME OFF AND THE FOURTH TIME HE SUCCEEDED
HUGI WITH WHOM THIALFI CONTENDED IN RUNNING WAS THOUGHT
AND ON PARTING ASKED THOR HOW HE THOUGHT HIS JOURNEY HAD TURNED OUT AND WHETHER HE HAD MET WITH ANY MEN STRONGER THAN HIMSELF THOR TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT DENY BUT THAT HE HAD BROUGHT GREAT SHAME ON HIMSELF AND WHAT GRIEVES ME MOST HE ADDED
WE HAVE A VERY TRIFLING GAME HERE ANSWERED UTGARD LOKI IN WHICH WE EXERCISE NONE BUT CHILDREN IT CONSISTS IN MERELY LIFTING MY CAT FROM THE GROUND NOR SHOULD I HAVE DARED TO MENTION SUCH A FEAT TO THE GREAT THOR IF I HAD NOT ALREADY OBSERVED THAT THOU ART BY NO MEANS WHAT WE TOOK THEE FOR
AND BY MY TROTH HAD I KNOWN BEFOREHAND THAT THOU HADST SO MUCH STRENGTH IN THEE
THE UNCLE OF THE FALLEN PRINCES
NAY SAID UTGARD LOKI
IN THE FIRST COURSE HUGI SO MUCH OUT STRIPPED HIS COMPETITOR THAT HE TURNED BACK AND MET HIM NOT FAR FROM THE STARTING PLACE
PREPARED TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN A TERRIBLE GROANING WAS HEARD DURING THE NIGHT
THE GODDESS IN HER WRATH DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS SIGHT BUT AFTERWARDS RELENTING GAVE HIM IN COMPENSATION THE KNOWLEDGE OF FUTURE EVENTS
SO THEY TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY AND AT DUSK SKRYMIR CHOSE A PLACE FOR THEM TO PASS THE NIGHT IN UNDER A LARGE OAK TREE SKRYMIR THEN TOLD THEM HE WOULD LIE DOWN TO SLEEP BUT TAKE YE THE WALLET HE ADDED AND PREPARE YOUR SUPPER
WHAT'S THE MATTER ARE THERE ANY BIRDS PERCHED ON THIS TREE I FELT SOME MOSS FROM THE BRANCHES FALL ON MY HEAD HOW FARES IT WITH THEE THOR BUT THOR WENT AWAY HASTILY SAYING THAT HE HAD JUST THEN AWOKE AND THAT AS IT WAS ONLY MIDNIGHT THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR SLEEP HE HOWEVER
BUT THE CAT BENDING HIS BACK HAD NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THOR'S EFFORTS ONLY ONE OF HIS FEET LIFTED UP SEEING WHICH THOR MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT THIS TRIAL HAS TURNED OUT SAID UTGARD LOKI JUST AS I IMAGINED IT WOULD THE CAT IS LARGE
BUT COULD NOT AVERT HIS DESTINY PURSUED BY THE ENEMY HE FLED ALONG THE RIVER WHEN A THUNDERBOLT LAUNCHED BY JUPITER OPENED THE GROUND AND HE
WHICH IS USED AS A PROVERBIAL EXPRESSION FOR ANYTHING WHICH IS PERPETUALLY DOING BUT NEVER DONE
JUST AT THIS TIME HERCULES ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND FOUND ALL THE INMATES IN GREAT DISTRESS FOR THE IMPENDING LOSS OF THE DEVOTED WIFE AND BELOVED MISTRESS HERCULES TO WHOM NO LABOR WAS TOO ARDUOUS RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT HER RESCUE
EMPLOYED EVERY ART TO GAIN TIME STILL HOPING FOR ULYSSES RETURN
HOWEVER AS HE WAS VERY THIRSTY
AND WHETHER THEY HAD SUPPED AND WERE READY TO GO TO SLEEP
THE HEROIC YOUTH LEARNING THE RESPONSE THREW AWAY HIS LIFE IN THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
TO HER GLAD HUSBAND GAVE RESCUED FROM DEATH BY FORCE THOUGH PALE AND FAINT J R LOWELL HAS CHOSEN THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS FOR THE SUBJECT OF A SHORT POEM HE MAKES THAT EVENT THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF POETRY TO MEN MEN CALLED HIM
WHO WOULD NOT THINK IT BENEATH HIM TO WRESTLE WITH THEE LET SOMEBODY HOWEVER CALL HITHER THAT OLD CRONE
SKRYMIR SOON FELL ASLEEP AND BEGAN TO SNORE STRONGLY
BUT SLEEP CAME NOT THAT NIGHT TO THOR
THE MORE THOR TIGHTENED HIS HOLD ON THE CRONE THE FIRMER SHE STOOD AT LENGTH AFTER A VERY VIOLENT STRUGGLE THOR BEGAN TO LOSE HIS FOOTING AND WAS FINALLY BROUGHT DOWN UPON ONE KNEE UTGARD LOKI THEN TOLD THEM TO DESIST ADDING THAT THOR HAD NOW NO OCCASION TO ASK ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HALL TO WRESTLE WITH HIM
WHICH THOU WAST NOT AWARE OF BUT WHEN THOU COMEST TO THE SHORE THOU WILT PERCEIVE HOW MUCH THE SEA HAS SUNK BY THY DRAUGHTS THOU DIDST PERFORM A FEAT NO LESS WONDERFUL BY LIFTING UP THE CAT AND TO TELL THEE THE TRUTH
IT WAS THE LABOR OF MY INFANCY TO CONQUER SNAKES SO SAYING HE CLASPED MY NECK WITH HIS HANDS I WAS ALMOST CHOKED
AND LET THOR WRESTLE WITH HER IF HE WILL SHE HAS THROWN TO THE GROUND MANY A MAN NOT LESS STRONG THAN THIS THOR IS A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN THEN ENTERED THE HALL AND WAS TOLD BY UTGARD LOKI TO TAKE HOLD OF THOR THE TALE IS SHORTLY TOLD
YOU LOOK PALE YOU'D BETTER KEEP OUT OF THE SUN THIS AFTERNOON ADMONISHED MISSUS LYNDE DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LIES YOU TOLD MISSUS LYNDE ASKED DORA REPROACHFULLY AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE AFTER DINNER DAVY
I RUN AWAY FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WENT FISHING WITH THE COTTONS
RUBY SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT ANNE'S WAIST WITH A SHALLOW LITTLE LAUGH BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET AND BEHIND ALL THE LUSTER OF RUBY'S ANNE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE COME UP OFTEN WON'T YOU ANNE WHISPERED RUBY
OF COURSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AND THEY WILL LIKELY ASK YOU TO SEND THEM MORE YOU MAY BE AS FAMOUS AS MISSUS MORGAN SOME DAY ANNE AND THEN HOW PROUD I'LL BE OF KNOWING YOU SAID DIANA WHO POSSESSED AT LEAST THE STRIKING MERIT
WHEN DIANA INTRODUCED ANNE I'VE HEARD OF YOU HER TONE IMPLIED THAT SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING GOOD MISSUS ANDREWS WAS TELLING ME YOU WERE HOME SHE SAID YOU HAD IMPROVED A GOOD DEAL THERE WAS NO DOUBT AUNT ATOSSA THOUGHT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT
IN IMAGINATION ANNE SAW HERSELF READING A STORY OUT OF A MAGAZINE TO MARILLA ENTRAPPING HER INTO PRAISE OF IT FOR IN IMAGINATION ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE AND THEN TRIUMPHANTLY ANNOUNCING HERSELF THE AUTHOR ONE DAY
SAID MISTER HARRISON I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUTTING MARRYING OFF TOO LONG LIKE I DID
DAVY WAS STILL BOILING OVER THIS AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF THE LANE DAVY STOPPED AND TWISTED HIS COUNTENANCE INTO SUCH AN UNEARTHLY AND TERRIFIC CONTORTION THAT DORA ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW HIS GIFTS IN THAT RESPECT
INSTEAD HERE SHE WAS ROAMING THE WOODS WITH THOSE HALF WILD COTTONS TRYING TO KEEP HER BOOTS CLEAN AND HER PRETTY WHITE DRESS FREE FROM RENTS AND STAINS MIRABEL HAD OFFERED THE LOAN OF AN APRON BUT DORA HAD SCORNFULLY REFUSED
BUT I WOULDN'T PESTER EDITORS WITH IT I'D WRITE OF PEOPLE AND PLACES LIKE I KNEW
THE VERY IDEA OF YOUR BEING SCARED OF THOSE COWS SCOFFED DAVY WHY THEY'RE BOTH YOUNGER THAN YOU THEY'RE BIGGER SAID DORA THEY WON'T HURT YOU COME ALONG NOW THIS IS GREAT
YOU'LL GO TO THE OTHER PLACE IF YOU BREAK THE SABBATH DAY SAID UNHAPPY DORA FOLLOWING HIM SORELY AGAINST HER WILL BUT DAVY WAS NOT SCARED YET
BUT HER TONGUE IS SHARPER STILL LATE AS IT WAS AUNT ATOSSA WAS CUTTING POTATO SETS IN THE WRIGHT KITCHEN SHE WORE A FADED OLD WRAPPER AND HER GRAY HAIR WAS DECIDEDLY UNTIDY AUNT ATOSSA DID NOT LIKE BEING CAUGHT IN A KILTER
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS DAVY AND DORA WERE READY FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL THEY WERE GOING ALONE WHICH DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN FOR MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS ATTENDED SUNDAY SCHOOL
BUT HE KNEW ANYWAY DAVY THAT'S WHAT DORA SAID
IT'S JUST WHAT ANYBODY MIGHT DO HEROINES SHOULDN'T DO COOKING I THINK WHY THAT IS WHERE THE HUMOR COMES IN AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE WHOLE STORY SAID ANNE AND IT MAY BE STATED THAT IN THIS SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT
WITHOUT TRYING TO BRING THEM UP PROPERLY AND IT WAS ONLY THE PRECEDING AFTERNOON THAT SHE HAD INTERFERED TO INFLUENCE MARILLA
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE BAD LIKE THAT AGAIN
DID YOU SAY YOUR GOLDEN TEXT AND CATECHISM YES'M DID YOU PUT YOUR COLLECTION IN YES'M WAS MISSUS MALCOLM MAC PHERSON IN CHURCH I DON'T KNOW THIS AT LEAST WAS THE TRUTH THOUGHT WRETCHED DAVY WAS THE LADIES
IF WE COULD SAIL TO IT IN THE MOONSHINE BOAT PAUL WROTE OF IN HIS OLD COMPOSITION YOU REMEMBER HOW NICE IT WOULD BE SAID ANNE ROUSING FROM HER REVERIE
CHANGING THE NAME OF COURSE OR ELSE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD PROBABLY THINK SHE WAS THE HEROINE
AND HAILED DAVY'S APPEARANCE WITH WHOOPS OF DELIGHT PETE TOMMY ADOLPHUS AND MIRABEL COTTON WERE ALL ALONE THEIR MOTHER AND OLDER SISTERS WERE AWAY DORA WAS THANKFUL MIRABEL WAS THERE AT LEAST
ALTHOUGH SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT IF IT IS A SUCCESS YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED GILBERT BUT IF IT IS A FAILURE NOBODY SHALL EVER SEE IT MARILLA KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE VENTURE
THUS ACCOUTERED BOG AND MARSH AND UNDERGROWTH HAD NO TERRORS FOR HIM DORA WAS FRANKLY AND MANIFESTLY MISERABLE SHE FOLLOWED THE OTHERS IN THEIR PEREGRINATIONS FROM POOL TO POOL CLASPING HER BIBLE AND QUARTERLY TIGHTLY
I'M AFRAID THAT IS TOO ARISTOCRATIC A NAME FOR A CHORE BOY DIANA
AT LEAST THE COTTONS CERTAINLY HAD AND DAVY SEEMED TO HAVE IT NOT BEING ENTIRELY BEREFT OF PRUDENCE
AVONLEA HAD NOT CHANGED EITHER AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED AT FIRST BUT AS ANNE SAT IN THE GREEN GABLES PEW
IF IT IS TRUE THAT SHE IS DYING ANY OTHER SAD THING MIGHT BE TRUE TOO
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END IT HAPPILY OR UNHAPPILY I'M NOT SURE
YESTERDAY WAS REAL DINKY BUT I LIKE SOMETHING BRIGHTER FOR MYSELF DID YOU NOTICE THOSE TWO RIDICULOUS BOYS DOWNSTAIRS THEY'VE BOTH COME DETERMINED TO SIT EACH OTHER OUT I DON'T CARE A SINGLE BIT ABOUT EITHER OF THEM YOU KNOW HERB SPENCER IS THE ONE I LIKE
FITZOSBORNE SUGGESTED DIANA WHO HAD A STORE OF SUCH NAMES LAID AWAY IN HER MEMORY RELICS OF THE OLD STORY CLUB WHICH SHE AND ANNE AND JANE ANDREWS AND RUBY GILLIS HAD HAD IN THEIR SCHOOLDAYS ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY
RETORTED DAVY RECKLESSLY WELL IF YOU MUST SAY DREADFUL WORDS DON'T SAY THEM ON SUNDAY PLEADED DORA DAVY WAS AS YET FAR FROM REPENTANCE BUT IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE FELT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR
ANNE DROPPED HER LIDS TO HIDE HER DANCING EYES SHE RECALLED THE STORMY WINTER NIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WHEN JANE HAD PROPOSED FOR BILLY HE CERTAINLY HAD NOT BROKEN HIS HEART OVER HIS REJECTION ANNE WONDERED IF JANE HAD ALSO PROPOSED TO NETTIE FOR HIM
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THAT REPORT SAID DIANA BLUSHING WELL DON'T PUT IT OFF TOO LONG SAID AUNT ATOSSA SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL FADE SOON YOU'RE ALL COMPLEXION AND HAIR AND THE WRIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE FICKLE
HE DID BAD THINGS BUT HE DID THEM PERCEVAL HADN'T TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT MOONING MOONING THAT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN PITCHING MAURICE LENNOX WAS THE VILLAIN SAID ANNE INDIGNANTLY I DON'T SEE WHY EVERY ONE LIKES HIM BETTER THAN PERCEVAL
ANNE TOOK THIS SECOND REJECTION WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR SHE LOCKED THE STORY AWAY IN THE GARRET TRUNK WHERE THE OLD STORY CLUB TALES REPOSED
THEN POOR DAVY BETOOK HIMSELF TO A SECLUDED RETREAT BEHIND THE WOODPILE TO THINK OVER THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS GREEN GABLES WAS WRAPPED IN DARKNESS AND SILENCE WHEN ANNE REACHED HOME SHE LOST NO TIME GOING TO BED FOR SHE WAS VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY
NO IT'S IN YOUR SOUL ANSWERED ANNE THANKFUL FOR THE DARKNESS SINCE GRAVITY MUST BE PRESERVED IN SERIOUS MATTERS I S'POSE I CAN'T GET CLEAR OF IT THEN SAID DAVY WITH A SIGH
IN HER LITERARY PURSUITS NOW SHE WOULD BE JUBILANT OVER A BRILLIANT IDEA NOW DESPAIRING BECAUSE SOME CONTRARY CHARACTER WOULD NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY DIANA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THEM DO AS YOU WANT THEM TO SHE SAID
WAS HONESTLY ALARMED LEST HE SHOULD NEVER IN THE WORLD BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT AGAIN DARN HER EXPLODED DAVY OH DAVY DON'T SWEAR GASPED DORA IN DISMAY
THOMAS PUSSY SAID DAVY I THINK GENTLEMAN CAT WOULD BE MORE POLITE REFLECTED DORA YOU THINKING RETORTED DAVY WITH WITHERING SCORN DAVY WAS NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE
I DARESAY THERE'S BEEN MANY A ROMANCE IN AVONLEA AND MANY A TRAGEDY TOO SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY BUT YOUR FOLKS AIN'T LIKE REAL FOLKS ANYWHERE THEY TALK TOO MUCH AND USE TOO HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE
IN THE PEWS MORE THAN ONE FAMILIAR FACE WAS MISSING FOREVER OLD UNCLE ABE HIS PROPHESYING OVER AND DONE WITH MISSUS PETER SLOANE WHO HAD SIGHED IT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR THE LAST TIME TIMOTHY COTTON
BUT SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO TEACH AGAIN IN THE FALL AND SHE'S AFTER THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL SHE'LL BE IN HER GRAVE POOR GIRL WHEN WHITE SANDS SCHOOL OPENS THAT'S WHAT ANNE LISTENED IN SHOCKED SILENCE RUBY GILLIS HER OLD SCHOOL CHUM DYING
WELL ANYWAY IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT STORY ANNE AND WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS OF THAT I'M SURE HAVE YOU GOT A TITLE FOR IT
PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO VISITING CATCH THINGS TOO SOMETIMES THEY EVEN DIE SAID DIANA SOLEMNLY THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR IT RETORTED AUNT ATOSSA TRIUMPHANTLY
SHE'S FIGHTING SO HARD FOR HER LIFE AND YET SHE HASN'T ANY CHANCE AT ALL THEY SAY THE GIRLS WALKED SILENTLY DOWN THE RED TWILIT ROAD THE ROBINS WERE SINGING VESPERS IN THE HIGH TREETOPS FILLING THE GOLDEN AIR WITH THEIR JUBILANT VOICES
THEY SPENT A SPLENDID HALF HOUR CLIMBING ON THE ROOF AND DIVING OFF INTO THE STRAW WITH WHOOPS AND YELLS BUT EVEN UNLAWFUL PLEASURES MUST COME TO AN END WHEN THE RUMBLE OF WHEELS OVER THE POND BRIDGE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING HOME FROM CHURCH
OUT CAME THE SUNSET BUT IN SPITE OF THIS HEROIC MUTILATION THE EDITOR OF THE CANADIAN WOMAN SENT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT BACK SO PROMPTLY
DON'T YOU TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT AT JANE ANNE GAZED THAT DAY IN DISMAY AND SURPRISE IT WAS AT RUBY GILLIS WHO SAT BESIDE HER IN THE CHOIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUBY
THIS IS THE END OF MY LITERARY AMBITIONS SHE SAID BITTERLY SHE NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER TO MISTER HARRISON
SHE WAS EVEN HANDSOMER THAN EVER BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE TOO BRIGHT AND LUSTROUS AND THE COLOR OF HER CHEEKS WAS HECTICALLY BRILLIANT BESIDES SHE WAS VERY THIN THE HANDS THAT HELD HER HYMN BOOK WERE ALMOST TRANSPARENT IN THEIR DELICACY
CHAPTER TWELVE AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF ANNE THE TWO GIRLS WERE LOITERING ONE EVENING IN A FAIRY HOLLOW OF THE BROOK FERNS NODDED IN IT
AND MARCHED ALONG IN IT SHUFFLING HIS FEET VICIOUSLY UNTIL HE WAS ENVELOPED IN A HAZY CLOUD THAT'S THE BEGINNING HE ANNOUNCED TRIUMPHANTLY
WHEN I'M THROUGH REDMOND I'LL STICK TO TEACHING I CAN TEACH I CAN'T WRITE STORIES
THAT CONGESTION LAST WINTER PULLED ME DOWN A LITTLE BUT JUST SEE MY COLOR I DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE AN INVALID I'M SURE RUBY'S VOICE WAS ALMOST SHARP
I'VE LEFT OUT ALL THE DESCRIPTIONS BUT THE SUNSET SHE SAID AT LAST I SIMPLY COULDN'T LET IT GO IT WAS THE BEST OF THEM ALL IT HASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY SAID MISTER HARRISON
SHE'D HAVE REFORMED HIM YOU CAN REFORM A MAN
WOULD WIN ANY GIRL'S HEART COMPLETELY
I'D RATHER TELL YOU FIRST WHAT IS IT YOU DID
WHAT DID YOU DO OH I'M AFRAID TO TELL YOU YOU'LL NEVER LIKE ME AGAIN ANNE
I SHALL NEVER TRY TO WRITE A STORY AGAIN DECLARED ANNE WITH THE HOPELESS FINALITY OF NINETEEN WHEN A DOOR IS SHUT IN ITS FACE I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ALTOGETHER SAID MISTER HARRISON REFLECTIVELY
YOU USED TO WRITE PERFECTLY THRILLING STORIES YEARS AGO IN OUR OLD STORY CLUB
BUT HIS SOUL SEETHED WITHIN DAVY HAD SUFFERED OR THOUGHT HE HAD SUFFERED MANY THINGS AT THE HANDS AND TONGUE OF MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SINCE SHE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES FOR MISSUS LYNDE COULD NOT LIVE WITH ANYBODY WHETHER THEY WERE NINE OR NINETY
YES'M QUAKINGLY WAS PRAYER MEETING I I DON'T KNOW YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU SHOULD LISTEN MORE ATTENTIVELY TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WHAT WAS MISTER HARVEY'S TEXT DAVY TOOK A FRANTIC GULP OF WATER
AND HIS CATECHISM QUESTION PERFECTLY HAD HE NOT STUDIED THEM PERFORCE IN MISSUS LYNDE'S KITCHEN ALL LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON DAVY THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PLACID FRAME OF MIND AS A MATTER OF FACT
I CALL IT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE AND ALLITERATIVE NOW DIANA TELL ME CANDIDLY DO YOU SEE ANY FAULTS IN MY STORY WELL
THEY DARED NOT OF COURSE GO FISHING ON THE POND WHERE THEY WOULD BE SEEN BY PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH THEY HAD TO RESORT TO THE BROOK IN THE WOODS BEHIND THE COTTON HOUSE BUT IT WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THEY HAD A GLORIOUS TIME THAT MORNING
ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIS OWN INCLINATION AFTER BEHAVING AS BADLY AS POSSIBLE ALL DAY SHE SOMETIMES CAME FONDLING TO MAKE IT UP AT NIGHT
THEE THAT MADE HER CRY AT FIRST AND THEN BEING REPULSED CONTINUALLY HARDENED HER
HINDLEY'S MANIFESTATION OF SCORN WHILE HIS FATHER WAS NEAR ROUSED THE OLD MAN TO A FURY HE SEIZED HIS STICK TO STRIKE HIM
SHE OUGHT TO MARRY AN ARMENIAN OR A PORTUGUESE
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD STAND THE TEST THE TEST I
BUT ISABEL CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SERIOUSNESS YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT LILY I DON'T FEEL GRAND AT ALL I'M SURE THERE'S NO HARM SAID THE CONCILIATORY LILY
SHE HAD HEARD THE SOUND BEFORE AND SHE RECOGNISED IT
AND IT HAD LED TO HER BEGINNING AFRESH A GREAT MANY TIMES
SHE LIVED IN ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY FOR DANCING PLENTY OF NEW DRESSES THE LONDON SPECTATOR THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS THE MUSIC OF GOUNOD THE POETRY OF BROWNING THE PROSE OF GEORGE ELIOT THESE THINGS NOW AS MEMORY PLAYED OVER THEM
WAS TO KEEP HER SEPARATE FROM HIM YET SHE GOT CHIDED MORE THAN ANY OF US ON HIS ACCOUNT IN PLAY SHE LIKED EXCEEDINGLY TO ACT THE LITTLE MISTRESS USING HER HANDS FREELY AND COMMANDING HER COMPANIONS
SHE HAD OFTEN REMARKED IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE HELD HER RATHER WISTFULLY IN SIGHT
IT'S THOUGHT A VERY GOOD POSITION SAID THE YOUNGER SISTER IT'S THE FIRST POSITION IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY I DARE SAY YOU THINK ME VERY IRREVERENT ISABEL TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK
OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S APPEARANCE AND IN THE EVENING PREPARED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR AUNT'S COMMANDS OF WHAT ISABEL THEN SAID NO REPORT HAS REMAINED
SHE WAS REASSURED QUICKLY ENOUGH BY HER SENSE OF HIS GREAT GOOD MANNERS
DO YOU MEAN DO YOU MEAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXPENSE THE YOUNGER ONE ASKED I DARE SAY HE MIGHT LET ONE OR TWO OF HIS HOUSES SAID THE OTHER LET THEM FOR NOTHING ISABEL DEMANDED
YOU'RE SO GOOD AS TO HAVE A THEORY ABOUT ME
THAN SPOKE THEIR GOOD WISHES
BUT AT LAST AFTER A PAUSE OF SOME DURATION RETURNING FOR A MOMENT TO THEIR OSTENSIBLE THEME AH WELL HE SAID I'M VERY GLAD INDEED YOU LIKE THE OLD BARRACK I WISH YOU COULD SEE MORE OF IT THAT YOU COULD STAY HERE A WHILE
HER FATHER HAD A LARGE WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE OF WHICH HIS RESTLESSNESS AND EVEN HIS OCCASIONAL INCOHERENCY OF CONDUCT HAD BEEN ONLY A PROOF
SHE HAD A GREAT DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE BUT SHE REALLY PREFERRED ALMOST ANY SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO THE PRINTED PAGE
FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING FRAME WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT
WERE ENCASED IN SEALSKIN JACKETS THEIR FRIENDLINESS WAS GREAT SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO SHOW IT THEY SEEMED SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF THE YOUNG LADY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND RATHER LOOKED
SAID THE ELDER SISTER BUT I DARE SAY YOU'LL TAKE US AS YOU FIND US
AS THE TWO WERE MAKING READY FOR THEIR VISIT I DO HOPE IMMENSELY SHE'LL DO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR ISABEL SHE HAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER WHAT IS IT YOU WISH HER TO DO EDMUND LUDLOW ASKED
SINCE HIS DEATH SHE HAD SEEMED TO SEE HIM AS TURNING HIS BRAVER SIDE TO HIS CHILDREN AND AS NOT HAVING MANAGED TO IGNORE THE UGLY QUITE SO MUCH IN PRACTICE AS IN ASPIRATION BUT THIS ONLY MADE HER TENDERNESS FOR HIM GREATER
TIME ENOUGH TO INSTITUTE A SEARCH FOR A RICH ECCLESIASTICISM AND GIVE IT UP AS VAIN
YOU CAN'T DO SO IF YOUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BY IRRELEVANT GOSSIP HIS OWN CONVERSATION
I RAN TO THE CHILDREN'S ROOM THEIR DOOR WAS AJAR
I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE LIBERAL MILDRED ARGUED GENTLY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO EVEN FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
EXPRESSLY TO SEE HER HAVING LEARNED IN THE FORMER CITY WHERE HE WAS SPENDING A FEW DAYS AND WHERE HE HAD HOPED TO FIND HER THAT SHE WAS STILL AT THE STATE CAPITAL
FOR THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHOSE HEARTS AS THEY APPROACHED HER BEAT ONLY JUST FAST ENOUGH TO REMIND THEM THEY HAD HEADS AS WELL HAD KEPT HER UNACQUAINTED WITH THE SUPREME DISCIPLINES OF HER SEX AND AGE
TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS
HE WAS ALSO LEAN AND BROWN HE WAS NOT ROMANTICALLY HE WAS MUCH RATHER OBSCURELY HANDSOME BUT HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD AN AIR
THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WAS CASPAR GOODWOOD
NO I'M NOT EASILY CHARMED AND THEN HE STOPPED A MOMENT
AND SHE DEEMED THIS A GREAT CHARM FOR TWO OR THREE OF THE FRIENDS OF HER GIRLHOOD HAD BEEN REGRETTABLY OPEN TO THE CHARGE
THEN HOWEVER I WENT THROUGH WIND AND RAIN AND BROUGHT ONE THE DOCTOR BACK WITH ME THE OTHER SAID HE WOULD COME IN THE MORNING LEAVING JOSEPH TO EXPLAIN MATTERS
SAID ISABEL SERIOUSLY WELL YOU THINK US QUAINT' THAT'S THE SAME THING
HER VISITORS FLUSHED AND HER COUSIN TOLD HER AFTER THEY WERE GONE THAT IF SHE SAID SUCH THINGS TO THOSE POOR GIRLS THEY WOULD THINK SHE WAS IN SOME WILD FREE MANNER PRACTISING ON THEM
WHEN LORD WARBURTON SHOWED HER THE HOUSE AFTER LUNCHEON IT SEEMED TO HER A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IT SHOULD BE A NOBLE PICTURE WITHIN IT HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL MODERNISED SOME OF ITS BEST POINTS HAD LOST THEIR PURITY
BUT ISABEL WAS IN A SITUATION THAT GAVE A VALUE TO ANY CHANGE SHE HAD A DESIRE TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND HER AND AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF TO BEGIN AFRESH THIS DESIRE INDEED WAS NOT A BIRTH OF THE PRESENT OCCASION
WHO EXACTLY RESEMBLED THEM DEPRIVED OF THIS ADVANTAGE HOWEVER ISABEL'S VISITORS RETAINED THAT OF AN EXTREME SWEETNESS AND SHYNESS OF DEMEANOUR AND OF HAVING AS SHE THOUGHT
WHETHER SHE FELT GRAND OR NO SHE AT ANY RATE FELT DIFFERENT AS IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER LEFT TO HERSELF FOR THE EVENING SHE SAT A WHILE UNDER THE LAMP HER HANDS EMPTY HER USUAL AVOCATIONS UNHEEDED
THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID
BLUSTERED ROUND THE HOUSE AND ROARED IN THE CHIMNEY IT SOUNDED WILD AND STORMY YET IT WAS NOT COLD AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER I A LITTLE REMOVED FROM THE HEARTH
I DON'T MEAN OF COURSE THAT YOU AMUSE YOURSELF WITH TRIFLES YOU SELECT GREAT MATERIALS THE FOIBLES THE AFFLICTIONS OF HUMAN NATURE THE PECULIARITIES OF NATIONS
ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT BESPOKE RESOLUTION TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF WHICH IN HALF AN HOUR CASPAR GOODWOOD WHO HAD ARRIVED HOPEFUL AS WELL AS RESOLUTE TOOK HIS WAY BACK TO HIS LODGING WITH THE FEELING OF A MAN DEFEATED
BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
BUT THE DEPTHS OF THIS YOUNG LADY'S NATURE WERE A VERY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE BETWEEN WHICH AND THE SURFACE COMMUNICATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY A DOZEN CAPRICIOUS FORCES
HEATHCLIFF HE'S DEAD AND THEY BOTH SET UP A HEART BREAKING CRY
AS IT WERE QUITE CAPABLE OF FLOORING HIS MAN
BUT FOR MYSELF I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
MISS ARCHER THESE WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH AN INDEFINABLE SOUND WHICH STARTLED THE GIRL
DON'T YOU THINK SHE GETS ENOUGH AT HOME WELL SHE OUGHT TO GO ABROAD SAID MISSUS LUDLOW SHE'S JUST THE PERSON TO GO ABROAD AND YOU WANT THE OLD LADY TO TAKE HER IS THAT IT SHE HAS OFFERED TO TAKE HER SHE'S DYING TO HAVE ISABEL GO
BUT LORD WARBURTON EXERCISED SOME INGENUITY IN ENGAGING HIS LEAST FAMILIAR GUEST IN A STROLL APART FROM THE OTHERS I WISH YOU TO SEE THE PLACE PROPERLY SERIOUSLY HE SAID
YOU DON'T OF NECESSITY LOSE BY THAT IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY SO BUT EVEN IF I GAIN STERN JUSTICE IS NOT WHAT I MOST LOVE IS MISSUS TOUCHETT GOING TO TAKE YOU ABROAD I HOPE SO
TO HOPE WHAT THAT IN FUTURE I MAY SEE YOU OFTEN
THE RESULT WAS KALEIDOSCOPIC
CERTAINLY
IT APPEARED TO ISABEL THAT THE UNPLEASANT HAD BEEN EVEN TOO ABSENT FROM HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SHE HAD GATHERED FROM HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE THAT IT WAS OFTEN A SOURCE OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
HER TONGUE ALWAYS GOING SINGING LAUGHING AND PLAGUING EVERYBODY WHO WOULD NOT DO THE SAME
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE YOUR MIND MISS ARCHER HER COMPANION DECLARED IT'S ALREADY A MOST FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENT IT LOOKS DOWN ON US ALL IT DESPISES US DESPISES YOU YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME
LORD WARBURTON WAS BRIEFLY SILENT YOU JUDGE ONLY FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU DON'T CARE HE SAID PRESENTLY YOU ONLY CARE TO AMUSE YOURSELF
THINKING HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN OF HER TIME HAD PRONOUNCED THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE RULE I HAVE HINTED AT A FOOLISH PERIOD OF HISTORY
A CHANCE FOR WHAT A CHANCE TO DEVELOP OH MOSES EDMUND LUDLOW EXCLAIMED I HOPE SHE ISN'T GOING TO DEVELOP ANY MORE IF I WERE NOT SURE YOU ONLY SAID THAT FOR ARGUMENT
TOO INDIFFERENT TO SORDID CONSIDERATIONS
TO SEE AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE AND IT WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT BEFORE ISABEL WAS FOURTEEN HE HAD TRANSPORTED THEM THREE TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC GIVING THEM ON EACH OCCASION HOWEVER BUT A FEW MONTHS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED
IS THERE ANYTHING MYSTERIOUS IN A PURPOSE ENTERTAINED AND EXECUTED EVERY YEAR IN THE MOST PUBLIC MANNER BY FIFTY THOUSAND OF MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING ONE'S MIND BY FOREIGN TRAVEL
OF THE THINGS SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND HER THE YEARS AND HOURS OF HER LIFE CAME BACK TO HER AND FOR A LONG TIME IN A STILLNESS BROKEN ONLY BY THE TICKING OF THE BIG BRONZE CLOCK SHE PASSED THEM IN REVIEW
HAD NOT MADE AN IMPERTINENCE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER'S SINCERE ISABEL ENQUIRED WITH A SMILE OH HE MUST BE YOU KNOW MILDRED EXCLAIMED QUICKLY
FOR TWO PEOPLE MISS CATHY AND JOSEPH THE SERVANT YOU SAW HIM I DARESAY UP YONDER HE WAS AND IS YET MOST LIKELY THE WEARISOMEST SELF RIGHTEOUS PHARISEE
FRESH COMPLEXIONS AND SOMETHING OF THE SMILE OF CHILDHOOD YES THEIR EYES WHICH ISABEL ADMIRED WERE ROUND QUIET AND CONTENTED
AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
HAD THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THINKING ALL THE OTHERS AESTHETIC VULGARIANS
I THINK YOU'RE ENCHANTING JUST AS YOU ARE
ABOVE ALL WITH RIGHTNESS OF EFFECT NINETEEN PERSONS OUT OF TWENTY INCLUDING THE YOUNGER SISTER HERSELF
EYES LIKE THE BALANCED BASINS THE CIRCLES OF ORNAMENTAL WATER
A CANDID NATURAL COUNTENANCE A CAPACIOUS APPETITE AND A TENDENCY TO INDISCRIMINATE LAUGHTER
IS ENGLAND NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
AS THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD POSSESS THE LIKE FACULTY IN RESPECT TO THE WANTS OF THE UNION BUT AN INDEFINITE POWER OF TAXATION IN THE LATTER MIGHT AND PROBABLY WOULD IN TIME DEPRIVE THE FORMER OF THE MEANS OF PROVIDING FOR THEIR OWN NECESSITIES
A GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF EVERY POWER REQUISITE TO THE FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE OBJECTS COMMITTED TO ITS CARE AND TO THE COMPLETE EXECUTION OF THE TRUSTS FOR WHICH IT IS RESPONSIBLE FREE FROM EVERY OTHER CONTROL
THAT IT CAN BE ADMITTED TO HAVE ANY PRETENSIONS TO FAIRNESS THE MOMENT WE LAUNCH INTO CONJECTURES ABOUT THE USURPATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE GET INTO AN UNFATHOMABLE ABYSS AND FAIRLY PUT OURSELVES OUT OF THE REACH OF ALL REASONING
THE NATURAL CONCLUSION IS THAT SUCH CONTESTS WILL BE MOST APT TO END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE UNION AND THAT THERE IS GREATER PROBABILITY OF ENCROACHMENTS BY THE MEMBERS UPON THE FEDERAL HEAD THAN BY THE FEDERAL HEAD UPON THE MEMBERS
THE MORE INTELLIGENT ADVERSARIES OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ADMIT THE FORCE OF THIS REASONING BUT THEY QUALIFY THEIR ADMISSION BY A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT THEY CALL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TAXATION THE FORMER
CAN IT BE EXPECTED THAT THE DEFICIENCIES WOULD BE BETTER SUPPLIED IN THIS MODE THAN THE TOTAL WANTS OF THE UNION HAVE HERETOFORE BEEN SUPPLIED IN THE SAME MODE
BUT A REGARD TO THE PUBLIC GOOD AND TO THE SENSE OF THE PEOPLE AS THE DUTIES OF SUPERINTENDING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND OF SECURING THE PUBLIC PEACE AGAINST FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INVOLVE A PROVISION FOR CASUALTIES AND DANGERS
UNABLE BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO LAY HOLD OF FRESH RESOURCES AND URGED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL DANGER WOULD IT NOT BE DRIVEN TO THE EXPEDIENT OF DIVERTING THE FUNDS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FROM THEIR PROPER OBJECTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE STATE
OF THIS NATURE ARE THE MAXIMS IN GEOMETRY THAT THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN ITS PART THINGS EQUAL TO THE SAME ARE EQUAL TO ONE ANOTHER TWO STRAIGHT LINES CANNOT ENCLOSE A SPACE
BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL CONJECTURES OF THIS KIND MUST BE EXTREMELY VAGUE AND FALLIBLE AND THAT IT IS BY FAR THE SAFEST COURSE TO LAY THEM ALTOGETHER ASIDE AND TO CONFINE OUR ATTENTION WHOLLY TO THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE POWERS
COULD THEN REASONABLY REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN ITS ENGAGEMENTS BUT TO DEPEND UPON A GOVERNMENT THAT MUST ITSELF DEPEND UPON THIRTEEN OTHER GOVERNMENTS FOR THE MEANS OF FULFILLING ITS CONTRACTS WHEN ONCE ITS SITUATION IS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A GOVERNMENT HALF SUPPLIED AND ALWAYS NECESSITOUS CAN FULFILL THE PURPOSES OF ITS INSTITUTION CAN PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY ADVANCE THE PROSPERITY OR SUPPORT THE REPUTATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
I BELIEVE IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A POSITION WARRANTED BY THE HISTORY OF MANKIND THAT IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES
THEY WOULD RESERVE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THE LATTER WHICH THEY EXPLAIN INTO COMMERCIAL IMPOSTS OR RATHER DUTIES ON IMPORTED ARTICLES THEY DECLARE THEMSELVES WILLING TO CONCEDE TO THE FEDERAL HEAD
CONSIDERED AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY POLITIC AS THAT WHICH SUSTAINS ITS LIFE AND MOTION AND ENABLES IT TO PERFORM ITS MOST ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS A COMPLETE POWER THEREFORE TO PROCURE A REGULAR AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF IT
INCONSISTENT WITH EVERY IDEA OF VIGOR OR EFFICIENCY WHO CAN PRETEND THAT COMMERCIAL IMPOSTS ARE OR WOULD BE ALONE EQUAL TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION HAS GRADUALLY DWINDLED INTO A STATE OF DECAY APPROACHING NEARLY TO ANNIHILATION WHO CAN DOUBT THAT THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE IN BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE PROMOTED BY COMPETENT AUTHORITIES IN THE PROPER HANDS
THAT MANKIND WITHOUT DIFFICULTY ADOPT NOT ONLY THE MORE SIMPLE THEOREMS OF THE SCIENCE BUT EVEN THOSE ABSTRUSE PARADOXES WHICH HOWEVER THEY MAY APPEAR SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION
AS THEY ARE DELINEATED IN THE CONSTITUTION EVERY THING BEYOND THIS MUST BE LEFT TO THE PRUDENCE AND FIRMNESS OF THE PEOPLE WHO AS THEY WILL HOLD THE SCALES IN THEIR OWN HANDS
AS THEORY AND PRACTICE CONSPIRE TO PROVE THAT THE POWER OF PROCURING REVENUE IS UNAVAILING WHEN EXERCISED OVER THE STATES IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST OF NECESSITY BE INVESTED WITH AN UNQUALIFIED POWER OF TAXATION IN THE ORDINARY MODES
AND OF A PEACE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE UNION THUS CIRCUMSTANCED A WAR BREAKS OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE PROBABLE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SUCH AN EMERGENCY TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE THAT PROPER DEPENDENCE COULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE SUCCESS OF REQUISITIONS
AS FAR AS THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT MAY BE REGARDED AS AN INDISPENSABLE INGREDIENT IN EVERY CONSTITUTION FROM A DEFICIENCY IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE OF TWO EVILS MUST ENSUE
THEY WOULD BE MADE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT USURERS COMMONLY LEND TO BANKRUPT AND FRAUDULENT DEBTORS WITH A SPARING HAND AND AT ENORMOUS PREMIUMS IT MAY PERHAPS BE IMAGINED THAT FROM THE SCANTINESS OF THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
TO THE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES
HOW ELSE COULD IT HAPPEN IF WE ADMIT THE OBJECTORS TO BE SINCERE IN THEIR OPPOSITION THAT POSITIONS SO CLEAR AS THOSE WHICH MANIFEST THE NECESSITY OF A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION SHOULD HAVE TO ENCOUNTER ANY ADVERSARIES AMONG MEN OF DISCERNMENT
THE EXPENSE OF RAISING TROOPS OF BUILDING AND EQUIPPING FLEETS AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES IN ANY WISE CONNECTED WITH MILITARY ARRANGEMENTS AND OPERATIONS BUT THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY OBJECTS TO WHICH THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNION IN RESPECT TO REVENUE
A COUNTRY SO LITTLE OPULENT AS OURS MUST FEEL THIS NECESSITY IN A MUCH STRONGER DEGREE BUT WHO WOULD LEND TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PREFACED ITS OVERTURES FOR BORROWING
THOUGH THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ELSEWHERE FULLY STATED THEY WILL PERHAPS NOT BE IMPROPERLY RECAPITULATED IN THIS PLACE AS INTRODUCTORY TO AN EXAMINATION OF WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY WAY OF OBJECTION TO THEM THEY ARE IN SUBSTANCE AS FOLLOWS
TAKING INTO THE ACCOUNT THE EXISTING DEBT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC UPON ANY PLAN OF EXTINGUISHMENT WHICH A MAN MODERATELY IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE AND PUBLIC CREDIT COULD APPROVE
AS REVENUE IS THE ESSENTIAL ENGINE BY WHICH THE MEANS OF ANSWERING THE NATIONAL EXIGENCIES MUST BE PROCURED THE POWER OF PROCURING THAT ARTICLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPREHENDED IN THAT OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE EXIGENCIES
THE NECESSITY OF DIVERTING THE ESTABLISHED FUNDS IN THE CASE SUPPOSED WOULD EXIST THOUGH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD POSSESS AN UNRESTRAINED POWER OF TAXATION BUT TWO CONSIDERATIONS WILL SERVE TO QUIET ALL APPREHENSION ON THIS HEAD ONE IS
BUT THOUGH THIS BE STRICTLY AND TRULY THE CASE THOUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF SUCH A RIGHT WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF UNION THOUGH IT MAY SELDOM OR NEVER HAVE BEEN AVOWEDLY CLAIMED YET IN PRACTICE
AND ALL RIGHT ANGLES ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER OF THE SAME NATURE ARE THESE OTHER MAXIMS IN ETHICS AND POLITICS THAT THERE CANNOT BE AN EFFECT WITHOUT A CAUSE THAT THE MEANS OUGHT TO BE PROPORTIONED TO THE END
THAT WE ARE SURE THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IN THEIR FULL EXTENT WILL BE BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UNION THE OTHER IS THAT WHATEVER DEFICIENCES THERE MAY BE CAN WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE SUPPLIED BY LOANS
HOW CAN IT EVER POSSESS EITHER ENERGY OR STABILITY DIGNITY OR CREDIT CONFIDENCE AT HOME OR RESPECTABILITY ABROAD HOW CAN ITS ADMINISTRATION BE ANY THING ELSE THAN A SUCCESSION OF EXPEDIENTS TEMPORIZING
DID NOT EXPERIENCE EVINCE THE CONTRARY IT WOULD BE NATURAL TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PROPRIETY OF A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT SAFELY BE PERMITTED TO REST ON THE EVIDENCE OF THESE PROPOSITIONS
COMMANDS THE ASSENT OF THE MIND WHERE IT PRODUCES NOT THIS EFFECT IT MUST PROCEED EITHER FROM SOME DEFECT OR DISORDER IN THE ORGANS OF PERCEPTION OR FROM THE INFLUENCE OF SOME STRONG INTEREST OR PASSION OR PREJUDICE
IN WHAT DOES OUR SECURITY CONSIST AGAINST USURPATION FROM THAT QUARTER DOUBTLESS IN THE MANNER OF THEIR FORMATION AND IN A DUE DEPENDENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE TO ADMINISTER THEM UPON THE PEOPLE
THE HALCYON SCENES OF THE POETIC OR FABULOUS AGE BUT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A COMMON PORTION OF THE VICISSITUDES AND CALAMITIES WHICH HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF OTHER NATIONS THEY MUST APPEAR ENTITLED TO SERIOUS ATTENTION
THE POWER OF CREATING NEW FUNDS UPON NEW OBJECTS OF TAXATION BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY WOULD ENABLE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO BORROW AS FAR AS ITS NECESSITIES MIGHT REQUIRE FOREIGNERS AS WELL AS THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA
LET US ATTEND TO WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SITUATION IN THE VERY FIRST WAR IN WHICH WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ENGAGED WE WILL PRESUME FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE THAT THE REVENUE ARISING FROM THE IMPOST DUTIES ANSWERS THE PURPOSES OF A PROVISION FOR THE PUBLIC DEBT
IT IS TO BE HOPED WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO PRESERVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE GENERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS UPON THIS GROUND WHICH IS EVIDENTLY THE TRUE ONE
ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THE NATURAL CONCEPTIONS WHICH THE MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE LED TO ENTERTAIN UPON THE SUBJECT THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER OR IN OTHER WORDS THE INFINITE DIVISIBILITY OF A FINITE THING
IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH ALL PARTIES WILL ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE NECESSARY WE COULD NOT REASONABLY FLATTER OURSELVES THAT THIS RESOURCE ALONE UPON THE MOST IMPROVED SCALE WOULD EVEN SUFFICE FOR ITS PRESENT NECESSITIES
AND WOULD SUBJECT THEM ENTIRELY TO THE MERCY OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AS THE LAWS OF THE UNION ARE TO BECOME THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AS IT IS TO HAVE POWER TO PASS ALL LAWS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE AUTHORITIES WITH WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO VEST IT
IS A POINT AGREED AMONG GEOMETRICIANS THOUGH NOT LESS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO COMMON SENSE THAN ANY OF THOSE MYSTERIES IN RELIGION AGAINST WHICH THE BATTERIES OF INFIDELITY HAVE BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY LEVELED BUT IN THE SCIENCES OF MORALS AND POLITICS
ITS INEVITABLE TENDENCY WHENEVER IT IS BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY MUST BE TO ENFEEBLE THE UNION AND SOW THE SEEDS OF DISCORD AND CONTENTION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL HEAD AND ITS MEMBERS AND BETWEEN THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES
TO IMAGINE THAT AT SUCH A CRISIS CREDIT MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF INFATUATION IN THE MODERN SYSTEM OF WAR NATIONS THE MOST WEALTHY ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LARGE LOANS
THIS DISTINCTION HOWEVER WOULD VIOLATE THE MAXIM OF GOOD SENSE AND SOUND POLICY WHICH DICTATES THAT EVERY POWER OUGHT TO BE IN PROPORTION TO ITS OBJECT AND WOULD STILL LEAVE THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT IN A KIND OF TUTELAGE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
WOULD REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CREDULITY NOT OFTEN TO BE MET WITH IN THE PECUNIARY TRANSACTIONS OF MANKIND AND LITTLE RECONCILABLE WITH THE USUAL SHARP SIGHTEDNESS OF AVARICE REFLECTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE TRIFLING WEIGHT WITH MEN WHO HOPE TO SEE REALIZED IN AMERICA
BY AN ACT WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT NO RELIANCE COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEADINESS OF ITS MEASURES FOR PAYING THE LOANS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE WOULD BE AS LIMITED IN THEIR EXTENT AS BURDENSOME IN THEIR CONDITIONS
TO PILLAGE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY AND IN TURN SQUEEZES OUT OF THEM THE SUMS OF WHICH HE STANDS IN NEED TO SATISFY HIS OWN EXIGENCIES AND THOSE OF THE STATE IN AMERICA FROM A LIKE CAUSE
UNASSISTED BY ANY ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS OR ILLUSTRATIONS BUT WE FIND IN FACT THAT THE ANTAGONISTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN THEIR JUSTNESS OR TRUTH
AND OF TRIUMPH TO OUR ENEMIES WHAT REMEDY CAN THERE BE FOR THIS SITUATION BUT IN A CHANGE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH HAS PRODUCED IT IN A CHANGE OF THE FALLACIOUS AND DELUSIVE SYSTEM OF QUOTAS AND REQUISITIONS
HE DESPATCHED THE NOTE ON EASTER EVE AND THERE SEEMED A FINALITY IN THEIR DECISIONS BUT OTHER FORCES AND LAWS THAN THEIRS WERE IN OPERATION ON EASTER MONDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE WIDOW EDLIN
WOULDN'T THE WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY BAD NATURED IF SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO LIVE WITH HER HUSBAND MERELY HER VOICE UNDULATED AND HE GUESSED THINGS MERELY BECAUSE SHE HAD A PERSONAL FEELING AGAINST IT A PHYSICAL OBJECTION
AND AGAIN QUESTIONED HIS DEVOTIONAL MOTTO THAT ALL WAS FOR THE BEST HE RETIRED TO REST EARLY BUT HIS SLEEP WAS FITFUL FROM THE SENSE THAT SUE WAS SO NEAR AT HAND
THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAD TO LET YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL ALONE AND SO AT THE LAST MOMENT I CAME DEAR FAITHFUL SUE MURMURED JUDE
WHY SURELY A PERSON MAY SAY EVEN PROCLAIM UPON THE HOUSETOPS THAT IT HURTS AND GRIEVES HIM OR HER I HAVE SAID SO ANYHOW TO YOU PRESENTLY SHE WENT ON
LET ME HELP YOU EVEN IF I DO LOVE YOU AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T SAY IT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I CAN'T ADMIT SO MUCH AS THAT THERE GUESS WHAT YOU LIKE BUT DON'T PRESS ME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
I WISH YOU WERE HAPPY WHATEVER I MAY BE I CAN'T BE SO FEW COULD ENTER INTO MY FEELING THEY WOULD SAY TWAS MY FANCIFUL FASTIDIOUSNESS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND CONDEMN ME
AS WAS THE LITTLE CREATURE'S HABIT IT DID NOT SOON REPEAT ITS CRY AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO SO MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE BUT WOULD REMAIN BEARING ITS TORTURE TILL THE MORROW WHEN THE TRAPPER WOULD COME AND KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
WHEN DID YOU SEE HER WHEN I WAS AT CHRISTMINSTER
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES THE BONES OF KING EDWARD THE MARTYR CAREFULLY REMOVED HITHER FOR HOLY PRESERVATION BROUGHT SHASTON A RENOWN WHICH MADE IT THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE
ALL ALONE WITH ABERRANT PASSIONS AND UNACCOUNTABLE ANTIPATHIES NOW YOU MUSTN'T WAIT LONGER OR YOU WILL LOSE THE COACH COME AND SEE ME AGAIN YOU MUST COME TO THE HOUSE THEN YES SAID JUDE WHEN SHALL IT BE
I WAS OLD ENOUGH AND I THOUGHT I WAS VERY EXPERIENCED SO I RUSHED ON WHEN I HAD GOT INTO THAT TRAINING SCHOOL SCRAPE WITH ALL THE COCK SURENESS OF THE FOOL THAT I WAS
ALL NOW RUTHLESSLY SWEPT AWAY THROW THE VISITOR EVEN AGAINST HIS WILL INTO A PENSIVE MELANCHOLY WHICH THE STIMULATING ATMOSPHERE AND LIMITLESS LANDSCAPE AROUND HIM CAN SCARCELY DISPEL THE SPOT WAS THE BURIAL PLACE OF A KING AND A QUEEN
WHENCE HE REGARDED THE SPOT WHICH FATE HAD MADE THE HOME OF ALL HE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOLS WHICH WERE EXTENSIVE AND STONE BUILT GREW TWO ENORMOUS BEECHES WITH SMOOTH MOUSE COLOURED TRUNKS AS SUCH TREES WILL ONLY GROW ON CHALK UPLANDS
BUT I HAVE NOBODY AND I MUST TELL SOMEBODY JUDE BEFORE I MARRIED HIM I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OUT FULLY WHAT MARRIAGE MEANT EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS IDIOTIC OF ME THERE IS NO EXCUSE
AND DREW TOWARDS THE SCHOOL HOUSE THE HOUR WAS TOO EARLY THE PUPILS WERE STILL IN SCHOOL HUMMING SMALL LIKE A SWARM OF GNATS
I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE WITH HER NOW OF COURSE JUST AS YOU LIVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND
AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED AND HE MOVED HIS HAND TOWARDS HERS IT MET HIS OWN HALF WAY JUDE GRASPED IT JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE IT IS ODD SHE SAID IN A VOICE QUITE CHANGED THAT I SHOULD CARE ABOUT THAT AIR BECAUSE
THERE WAS EVER A SECOND SILENT CONVERSATION PASSING BETWEEN THEIR EMOTIONS
THE CENTURIES DID INDEED PONDEROUSLY OVERHANG A YOUNG WIFE WHO PASSED HER TIME HERE SHE HAD OPENED A ROSEWOOD WORK BOX AND WAS LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH HAVING CONTEMPLATED IT A LITTLE WHILE SHE PRESSED IT AGAINST HER BOSOM
THINK NO MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP OF SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN HE KNEW HER MOOD THE LOOK OF HER FACE WHEN SHE SUBSCRIBED HERSELF AT LENGTH THUS
OUT OF THE DEEP ALLUVIAL VALE OF BLACKMOOR THE VIEW FROM THE CASTLE GREEN OVER THREE COUNTIES OF VERDANT PASTURE SOUTH MID AND NETHER WESSEX BEING AS SUDDEN A SURPRISE TO THE UNEXPECTANT TRAVELLER'S EYES
BUT WHATEVER HER MOOD HE COULD NOT SAY SHE WAS WRONG IN HER VIEW HE REPLIED I ACQUIESCE YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS A LESSON IN RENUNCIATION WHICH I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO LEARN AT THIS SEASON JUDE
AND SHE LOOKED SO SLENDER TO DAY THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE MIGHT BE CRUSHED IN THE INTENSITY OF A TOO PASSIONATE EMBRACE SUCH AS IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO GIVE
AS THE MEDICINAL AIR IS TO HIS LUNGS
WITHIN THE MULLIONED AND TRANSOMED WINDOWS HE COULD SEE THE BLACK BROWN AND FLAXEN CROWNS OF THE SCHOLARS OVER THE SILLS AND TO PASS THE TIME AWAY HE WALKED DOWN TO THE LEVEL TERRACE WHERE THE ABBEY GARDENS ONCE HAD SPREAD HIS HEART THROBBING IN SPITE OF HIM
TWO MILES BEHIND IT A JET OF WHITE STEAM WAS TRAVELLING FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT OF THE PICTURE THERE WAS A LONG TIME TO WAIT EVEN NOW TILL HE WOULD KNOW IF SHE HAD ARRIVED
THE LAST TO MELCHESTER THAT NIGHT
AND HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD AT THAT MOMENT RECOGNIZED HIM HER FACE SOON BEGAN A PENSIVE SMILE WHICH LASTED TILL HAVING DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY HE MET HER I THOUGHT SHE BEGAN WITH NERVOUS QUICKNESS
NAMELY THAT THE CHIEF GRAVEYARD SLOPES UP AS STEEPLY AS A ROOF BEHIND THE CHURCH AND THAT IN FORMER TIMES THE TOWN PASSED THROUGH A CURIOUS PERIOD OF CORRUPTION CONVENTUAL AND DOMESTIC
I SAW IT BEFORE YOU HAD DONE IT BUT I THOUGHT I MUSTN'T INTERFERE I WAS WRONG I OUGHT TO HAVE BUT WHAT MAKES YOU ASSUME ALL THIS DEAR BECAUSE
BUT JUDE DO YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN THOSE QUESTIONS STILL ARE YOU GETTING UP APOLOGETICA YES I AM READING DIVINITY HARDER THAN EVER SHE REGARDED HIM CURIOUSLY WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT SAID JUDE
AS STRANGE WILD BIRDS ARE SEEN ASSEMBLED ON SOME LOFTY PROMONTORY MEDITATIVELY PAUSING FOR LONGER FLIGHTS OR TO RETURN BY THE COURSE THEY FOLLOWED THITHER SO HERE IN THIS CLIFF TOWN STOOD IN STULTIFIED SILENCE THE YELLOW AND GREEN CARAVANS
A FASTIDIOUSNESS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE CALLED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT RESPECT AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM I AM MERELY PUTTING A CASE OUGHT SHE TO TRY TO OVERCOME HER PRUDERIES JUDE THREW A TROUBLED LOOK AT HER
THE FAINT CLICK OF THE TRAP AS DRAGGED ABOUT BY THE WRITHING ANIMAL GUIDED HIM NOW AND REACHING THE SPOT HE STRUCK THE RABBIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WITH THE SIDE OF HIS PALM AND IT STRETCHED ITSELF OUT DEAD
THE SHORT CUT WAS MADE TO THE VILLAGE AS HE ASCENDED ON THE OTHER SIDE A LABOURING MAN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS APPROACH FROM A GATE ACROSS THE PATH MOVED UNEASILY AND PREPARED TO SPEAK I CAN SEE IN HIS FACE THAT SHE IS DEAD SAID JUDE
SUE I SOMETIMES THINK YOU ARE A FLIRT SAID HE ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE TILL SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW BY THE KETTLE FLAME THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED
DO YOU THINK JUDE THAT A MAN OUGHT TO MARRY A WOMAN HIS OWN AGE OR ONE YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF EIGHTEEN YEARS AS I AM THAN HE IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT THEY FEEL FOR EACH OTHER
SUE WAS SILENT IS IT WRONG JUDE SHE SAID WITH A TENTATIVE TREMOR FOR A HUSBAND OR WIFE TO TELL A THIRD PERSON THAT THEY ARE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE IF A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS A RELIGIOUS THING IT IS POSSIBLY WRONG
VAGUE IMAGININGS OF ITS CASTLE ITS THREE MINTS ITS MAGNIFICENT APSIDAL ABBEY THE CHIEF GLORY OF SOUTH WESSEX ITS TWELVE CHURCHES ITS SHRINES CHANTRIES HOSPITALS ITS GABLED FREESTONE MANSIONS
MISSUS EDLIN HAS PLENTY OF ROOM IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO STAY HERE VERY WELL SHE SAID DUBIOUSLY I DIDN'T TELL HIM I WOULD COME FOR CERTAIN
HE SAID LOOKING AWAY IT WOULD BE JUST ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH MY EXPERIENCES GO CONTRARY TO MY DOGMAS SPEAKING AS AN ORDER LOVING MAN WHICH I HOPE I AM THOUGH I FEAR I AM NOT I SHOULD SAY YES
SHE PLAYED ON AND SUDDENLY TURNED ROUND AND BY AN UNPREMEDITATED INSTINCT EACH CLASPED THE OTHER'S HAND AGAIN SHE UTTERED A FORCED LITTLE LAUGH AS SHE RELINQUISHED HIS QUICKLY HOW FUNNY SHE SAID
BUT I MUST TELL HIM WHO RICHARD OH
IF I WERE UNHAPPY IT WOULD BE MY FAULT MY WICKEDNESS NOT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO DISLIKE HIM HE IS CONSIDERATE TO ME IN EVERYTHING AND HE IS VERY INTERESTING FROM THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ACQUIRED BY READING EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN HIS WAY
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE WHEELS OF THE COACH DEPARTING AND TRULY ENOUGH WHEN HE REACHED THE DUKE'S ARMS IN THE MARKET PLACE THE COACH HAD GONE
WE WON'T GET ON TO THAT NOW SHE COAXED WILL YOU BE CARVING OUT AT THAT CHURCH AGAIN NEXT WEEK WHERE YOU LEARNT THE PRETTY HYMN YES PERHAPS THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SHALL I COME AND SEE YOU THERE
WOULD HAVE SHUNNED SUCH ENCOUNTERS IF THEY DOUBTED THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT HE COULD NOT
AS IT MEANS NOTHING IT MAY BE BOTHERING HIM NEEDLESSLY
BEARING NAMES NOT LOCAL AS IF SURPRISED BY A CHANGE IN THE LANDSCAPE SO VIOLENT AS TO HINDER THEIR FURTHER PROGRESS AND HERE THEY USUALLY REMAINED ALL THE WINTER TILL THEY TURNED TO SEEK AGAIN THEIR OLD TRACKS IN THE FOLLOWING SPRING
I WONDER WHAT WE BOTH DID THAT FOR I SUPPOSE BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH ALIKE AS I SAID BEFORE NOT IN OUR THOUGHTS PERHAPS A LITTLE IN OUR FEELINGS AND THEY RULE THOUGHTS
SUE AND JUDE HAD GONE SIDE BY SIDE TO THE GRAVE AND NOW SAT DOWN TO TEA IN THE FAMILIAR HOUSE
NO I AM NOT WHAT HAVE I DONE THEN I AM SURE I THOUGHT WE TWO
WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENORMOUS ABBEY THE WHOLE PLACE COLLAPSED IN A GENERAL RUIN THE MARTYR'S BONES MET WITH THE FATE OF THE SACRED PILE THAT HELD THEM AND NOT A STONE IS NOW LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY LIE
WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO GLAD TO GO BACK TO HER IF IF WHAT YOU USED TO SAY TO ME IS STILL TRUE I MEAN IF IT WERE TRUE THEN OF COURSE IT IS NOT NOW
HAVE TO THE REAL STAR PATTERNS I AM CALLED MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON LIVING A CALM WEDDED LIFE WITH MY COUNTERPART OF THAT NAME BUT I AM NOT REALLY MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON BUT A WOMAN TOSSED ABOUT
SHE SHAKES DOWN TO WITH COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE IN HALF A DOZEN YEARS BUT THAT IS MUCH LIKE SAYING THAT THE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB IS NO AFFLICTION SINCE A PERSON GETS COMFORTABLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE USE OF A WOODEN LEG OR ARM IN THE COURSE OF TIME
I WISH HE WOULD BEAT ME OR BE FAITHLESS TO ME OR DO SOME OPEN THING THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR FEELING AS I DO BUT HE DOES NOTHING EXCEPT THAT HE HAS GROWN A LITTLE COLD SINCE HE HAS FOUND OUT HOW I FEEL
I FEEL CRUSHED INTO THE EARTH BY THE WEIGHT OF SO MANY PREVIOUS LIVES THERE SPENT IN A NEW PLACE LIKE THESE SCHOOLS THERE IS ONLY YOUR OWN LIFE TO SUPPORT
ARE PASSED OVER IN THIS AND ONE OF THE QUEEREST AND QUAINTEST SPOTS IN ENGLAND STANDS VIRTUALLY UNVISITED TO DAY IT HAS A UNIQUE POSITION ON THE SUMMIT OF A STEEP AND IMPOSING SCARP RISING ON THE NORTH SOUTH AND WEST SIDES OF THE BOROUGH
ARE THERE MANY COUPLES DO YOU THINK WHERE ONE DISLIKES THE OTHER FOR NO DEFINITE FAULT YES I SUPPOSE IF EITHER CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON FOR INSTANCE BUT EVEN APART FROM THAT
WHAT TORTURES ME SO MUCH IS THE NECESSITY OF BEING RESPONSIVE TO THIS MAN WHENEVER HE WISHES GOOD AS HE IS MORALLY THE DREADFUL CONTRACT TO FEEL IN A PARTICULAR WAY IN A MATTER WHOSE ESSENCE IS ITS VOLUNTARINESS
COME READ YOU SHALL BE MY LIBRARIAN YOU'LL BE BETTER SITTING READING THAN HANGING ABOUT THE COURTYARD COME READ THIS
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PREPARING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY MIUESOV WITH WHOM HE WAS STAYING FOR THE TIME WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO ABROAD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH OR JENA THE YOUNG MAN WAS STILL UNDECIDED HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND ABSENT MINDED
HIS LIBERAL IRONY WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING ALMOST INTO ANGER WHO THE DEVIL IS THERE TO ASK IN THIS IMBECILE PLACE WE MUST FIND OUT FOR TIME IS PASSING HE OBSERVED SUDDENLY AS THOUGH SPEAKING TO HIMSELF

BUT FOR LADIES OF HIGHER RANK TWO ROOMS HAVE BEEN BUILT ADJOINING THE PORTICO BUT OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS YOU CAN SEE THE WINDOWS AND THE ELDER GOES OUT TO THEM BY AN INNER PASSAGE WHEN HE IS WELL ENOUGH THEY ARE ALWAYS OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS
AND SANG AND WAVED SOME OBJECT OVER THE DEAD CAT AS THOUGH IT WERE A CENSER ALL THIS HE DID ON THE SLY WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY
THEY SAY HE USED TO JUMP UP AND THRASH EVEN LADIES WITH A STICK OBSERVED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AS HE WENT UP THE STEPS THE ELDER VARSONOFY DID SOMETIMES SEEM RATHER STRANGE BUT A GREAT DEAL THAT'S TOLD IS FOOLISHNESS HE NEVER THRASHED ANY ONE ANSWERED THE MONK NOW GENTLEMEN
IT'S ALL UNTRUE MUMBLED THE BOY WITH A GRIN THEN GO TO THE DEVIL YOU HAVE THE SOUL OF A LACKEY STAY HERE'S SMARAGDOV'S UNIVERSAL HISTORY THAT'S ALL TRUE READ THAT
OUR VISITORS WERE AT ONCE SURROUNDED BY BEGGARS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT YOUNG KALGANOV WHO TOOK A TEN COPECK PIECE OUT OF HIS PURSE AND NERVOUS AND EMBARRASSED GOD KNOWS WHY HURRIEDLY GAVE IT TO AN OLD WOMAN SAYING DIVIDE IT EQUALLY
IT'S TRUE HE WOULD COME TO HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY BUT IF HE WERE ASKED WHAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT HE WOULD REMEMBER NOTHING YET PROBABLY HE HAS HIDDEN WITHIN HIMSELF THE IMPRESSION WHICH HAD DOMINATED HIM DURING THE PERIOD OF CONTEMPLATION
OH DEVIL TAKE THEM ALL AN OUTER SHOW ELABORATED THROUGH CENTURIES AND NOTHING BUT CHARLATANISM AND NONSENSE UNDERNEATH FLASHED THROUGH MIUESOV'S MIND HERE'S THE HERMITAGE WE'VE ARRIVED CRIED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH THE GATES ARE SHUT
WHERE DID THE LIGHT COME FROM ON THE FIRST DAY GRIGORY WAS THUNDERSTRUCK THE BOY LOOKED SARCASTICALLY AT HIS TEACHER THERE WAS SOMETHING POSITIVELY CONDESCENDING IN HIS EXPRESSION GRIGORY COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF
THOUGH I SHOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE SOME HOT COFFEE BRAVO MY DARLING HE'LL HAVE SOME COFFEE DOES IT WANT WARMING NO IT'S BOILING IT'S CAPITAL COFFEE SMERDYAKOV'S MAKING MY SMERDYAKOV'S AN ARTIST AT COFFEE AND AT FISH PATTIES
AND WAS VERY FOND OF CLEANING HIS SMART CALF BOOTS WITH A SPECIAL ENGLISH POLISH SO THAT THEY SHONE LIKE MIRRORS HE TURNED OUT A FIRST RATE COOK FYODOR PAVLOVITCH PAID HIM A SALARY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF WHICH SMERDYAKOV SPENT ON CLOTHES POMADE
ALL AT ONCE THERE CAME UP A BALD HEADED ELDERLY MAN WITH INGRATIATING LITTLE EYES WEARING A FULL SUMMER OVERCOAT LIFTING HIS HAT HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF WITH A HONEYED LISP AS MAXIMOV A LANDOWNER OF TULA
THOUGH HE NEVER SCOLDED HIM AND ALWAYS GAVE HIM A COPECK WHEN HE MET HIM SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS IN GOOD HUMOR HE WOULD SEND THE BOY SOMETHING SWEET FROM HIS TABLE BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF HIS ILLNESS HE SHOWED AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN HIM
STANDS A PEASANT IN A TORN KAFTAN AND BARK SHOES HE STANDS AS IT WERE LOST IN THOUGHT YET HE IS NOT THINKING HE IS CONTEMPLATING IF ANY ONE TOUCHED HIM HE WOULD START AND LOOK AT ONE AS THOUGH AWAKENING AND BEWILDERED
AND FURNISHED WITH OLD FASHIONED OSTENTATION THE FURNITURE WAS WHITE AND VERY OLD UPHOLSTERED IN OLD RED SILKY MATERIAL IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE WINDOWS THERE WERE MIRRORS IN ELABORATE WHITE AND GILT FRAMES OF OLD FASHIONED CARVING
YET NO OFFICIAL PERSONAGE MET THEM MIUESOV LOOKED ABSENT MINDEDLY AT THE TOMBSTONES ROUND THE CHURCH AND WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING THAT THE DEAD BURIED HERE MUST HAVE PAID A PRETTY PENNY FOR THE RIGHT OF LYING IN THIS HOLY PLACE BUT REFRAINED
AT ONE O'CLOCK NOT LATER AND YOU ALSO HE ADDED ADDRESSING MAXIMOV THAT I CERTAINLY WILL WITHOUT FAIL CRIED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HUGELY DELIGHTED AT THE INVITATION AND BELIEVE ME WE'VE ALL GIVEN OUR WORD TO BEHAVE PROPERLY HERE
AND NOT ONE WOMAN GOES IN AT THIS GATE THAT'S WHAT IS REMARKABLE AND THAT REALLY IS SO BUT I DID HEAR THAT THE ELDER RECEIVES LADIES HE REMARKED SUDDENLY TO THE MONK WOMEN OF THE PEOPLE ARE HERE TOO NOW LYING IN THE PORTICO THERE WAITING
THOUGH OF LATE HE HAS BEEN SO WEAK THAT HE HAS HARDLY SHOWN HIMSELF EVEN TO THE PEOPLE SO THEN THERE ARE LOOPHOLES AFTER ALL TO CREEP OUT OF THE HERMITAGE TO THE LADIES DON'T SUPPOSE HOLY FATHER THAT I MEAN ANY HARM
THE SERVANTS GRIGORY AND SMERDYAKOV WERE STANDING BY BOTH THE GENTLEMEN AND THE SERVANTS SEEMED IN SINGULARLY GOOD SPIRITS FYODOR PAVLOVITCH WAS ROARING WITH LAUGHTER BEFORE HE ENTERED THE ROOM ALYOSHA HEARD THE SHRILL LAUGH HE KNEW SO WELL
ALYOSHA LET ME GIVE YOU MY BLESSING A FATHER'S BLESSING ALYOSHA ROSE BUT FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD ALREADY CHANGED HIS MIND NO NO HE SAID I'LL JUST MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER YOU FOR NOW SIT STILL
BUT HAD FOR SOME REASON A LIKING FOR HIM ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AS MOROSELY AT HIM AS AT EVERY ONE AND WAS ALWAYS SILENT HE RARELY SPOKE IF IT HAD OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO WONDER AT THE TIME WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS INTERESTED IN AND WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND
THOUGH ONE OF THEM HAD RECENTLY MADE A DONATION OF A THOUSAND ROUBLES WHILE ANOTHER WAS A VERY WEALTHY AND HIGHLY CULTURED LANDOWNER UPON WHOM ALL IN THE MONASTERY WERE IN A SENSE DEPENDENT AS A DECISION OF THE LAWSUIT MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT PUT THEIR FISHING RIGHTS IN HIS HANDS
A WEEK LATER HE HAD HIS FIRST ATTACK OF THE DISEASE TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE EPILEPSY WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF IT HIS ATTITUDE TO THE BOY SEEMED CHANGED AT ONCE TILL THEN HE HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF HIM
ACH WHAT FINE GENTLEMEN'S AIRS GRIGORY MUTTERED LOOKING AT HIM WHEN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HEARD OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IN SMERDYAKOV HE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIM HIS COOK AND SENT HIM TO MOSCOW TO BE TRAINED
BUT ARRIVED JUST AS IT WAS OVER FIRST AN ELEGANT OPEN CARRIAGE DRAWN BY TWO VALUABLE HORSES DROVE UP WITH MIUESOV AND A DISTANT RELATIVE OF HIS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY CALLED PYOTR FOMITCH KALGANOV
THAT HE DROPPED IN THE MUDDY COURTYARD THREE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTES WHICH HE HAD ONLY JUST RECEIVED HE ONLY MISSED THEM NEXT DAY AND WAS JUST HASTENING TO SEARCH HIS POCKETS WHEN HE SAW THE NOTES LYING ON THE TABLE WHERE HAD THEY COME FROM
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM YET HE USED SOMETIMES TO STOP SUDDENLY IN THE HOUSE OR EVEN IN THE YARD OR STREET AND WOULD STAND STILL FOR TEN MINUTES LOST IN THOUGHT A PHYSIOGNOMIST STUDYING HIS FACE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO THOUGHT IN IT
AND COULD TELL FROM THE SOUND OF IT THAT HIS FATHER HAD ONLY REACHED THE GOOD HUMORED STAGE AND WAS FAR FROM BEING COMPLETELY DRUNK HERE HE IS HERE HE IS YELLED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HIGHLY DELIGHTED AT SEEING ALYOSHA JOIN US SIT DOWN
IF YOU WILL WAIT A MINUTE I WILL ANNOUNCE YOU FYODOR PAVLOVITCH FOR THE LAST TIME YOUR COMPACT DO YOU HEAR BEHAVE PROPERLY OR I WILL PAY YOU OUT MIUESOV HAD TIME TO MUTTER AGAIN I CAN'T THINK WHY YOU ARE SO AGITATED
HE CRIED SUDDENLY STEPPING WITHIN THE PRECINCTS WHAT A VALE OF ROSES THEY LIVE IN THOUGH THERE WERE NO ROSES NOW THERE WERE NUMBERS OF RARE AND BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN FLOWERS GROWING WHEREVER THERE WAS SPACE FOR THEM AND EVIDENTLY TENDED BY A SKILLFUL HAND
I'M AFRAID TO GO AMONG DECENT PEOPLE WITH HIM A FINE SMILE NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN SLYNESS CAME ON TO THE PALE BLOODLESS LIPS OF THE MONK BUT HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS EVIDENTLY SILENT FROM A SENSE OF HIS OWN DIGNITY MIUESOV FROWNED MORE THAN EVER
REMARKABLY UNSOCIABLE AND TACITURN NOT THAT HE WAS SHY OR BASHFUL ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS CONCEITED AND SEEMED TO DESPISE EVERYBODY BUT WE MUST PAUSE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT HIM NOW HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY GRIGORY AND MARFA
HE'S LIKE VON SOHN FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SAID SUDDENLY IS THAT ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IN WHAT WAY IS HE LIKE VON SOHN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN VON SOHN I'VE SEEN HIS PORTRAIT IT'S NOT THE FEATURES BUT SOMETHING INDEFINABLE
HE SPENT SOME YEARS THERE AND CAME BACK REMARKABLY CHANGED IN APPEARANCE HE LOOKED EXTRAORDINARILY OLD FOR HIS AGE HIS FACE HAD GROWN WRINKLED YELLOW AND STRANGELY EMASCULATE IN CHARACTER HE SEEMED ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
BUT LOOK HERE FYODOR PAVLOVITCH YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT WE HAD GIVEN OUR WORD TO BEHAVE PROPERLY REMEMBER IT I ADVISE YOU TO CONTROL YOURSELF BUT IF YOU BEGIN TO PLAY THE FOOL I DON'T INTEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU HERE YOU SEE WHAT A MAN HE IS HE TURNED TO THE MONK
NEVER MIND IF YOU WON'T HAVE IT WE WILL SAID FYODOR PAVLOVITCH BEAMING BUT STAY HAVE YOU DINED YES ANSWERED ALYOSHA WHO HAD IN TRUTH ONLY EATEN A PIECE OF BREAD AND DRUNK A GLASS OF KVAS IN THE FATHER SUPERIOR'S KITCHEN
FYODOR PAVLOVITCH NOTICED HIM LINGERING BY THE BOOKCASE AND READING THE TITLES THROUGH THE GLASS FYODOR PAVLOVITCH HAD A FAIR NUMBER OF BOOKS OVER A HUNDRED BUT NO ONE EVER SAW HIM READING
AND HE REPEATEDLY MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS TO THE SAINTS PAINTED ABOVE AND ON THE SIDES OF THE GATES WHEN YOU GO TO ROME YOU MUST DO AS THE ROMANS DO HERE IN THIS HERMITAGE THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE SAINTS BEING SAVED THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER AND EAT CABBAGES
BUT HE DID THE SAME WITH HIS BREAD HIS MEAT AND EVERYTHING HE ATE HE WOULD HOLD A PIECE ON HIS FORK TO THE LIGHT SCRUTINIZE IT MICROSCOPICALLY AND ONLY AFTER LONG DELIBERATION DECIDE TO PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH
SO THE BOOKCASE WAS CLOSED AGAIN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MARFA AND GRIGORY REPORTED TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH THAT SMERDYAKOV WAS GRADUALLY BEGINNING TO SHOW AN EXTRAORDINARY FASTIDIOUSNESS HE WOULD SIT BEFORE HIS SOUP TAKE UP HIS SPOON AND LOOK INTO THE SOUP
NOW WE'VE A TREAT FOR YOU IN YOUR OWN LINE TOO IT'LL MAKE YOU LAUGH BALAAM'S ASS HAS BEGUN TALKING TO US HERE AND HOW HE TALKS HOW HE TALKS BALAAM'S ASS IT APPEARED WAS THE VALET SMERDYAKOV HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FOUR AND TWENTY
OBSERVED MIUESOV SEVERELY THAT PERSONAGE HAS GRANTED US AN AUDIENCE SO TO SPEAK AND SO THOUGH WE THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THE WAY WE CANNOT ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY US I'VE BEEN THERE I'VE
DMITRI WAS LATE THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE TIME THE EVENING BEFORE THE VISITORS LEFT THEIR CARRIAGE AT THE HOTEL OUTSIDE THE PRECINCTS AND WENT TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY ON FOOT EXCEPT FYODOR PAVLOVITCH NONE OF THE PARTY HAD EVER SEEN THE MONASTERY
WHAT'S THAT FOR ASKED GRIGORY LOOKING AT HIM THREATENINGLY FROM UNDER HIS SPECTACLES OH NOTHING GOD CREATED LIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY AND THE SUN MOON AND STARS ON THE FOURTH DAY
ABANDON EVERYTHING AND GO OFF TO JERUSALEM ON A PILGRIMAGE FOR HIS SOUL'S SALVATION OR PERHAPS HE WILL SUDDENLY SET FIRE TO HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AND PERHAPS DO BOTH THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CONTEMPLATIVES AMONG THE PEASANTRY
AND WOULD WANDER ABOUT THE ROOM AT NIGHT OR SIT IN AN ARM CHAIR THINKING THIS HAD BECOME A HABIT WITH HIM HE OFTEN SLEPT QUITE ALONE IN THE HOUSE SENDING HIS SERVANTS TO THE LODGE BUT USUALLY SMERDYAKOV REMAINED SLEEPING ON A BENCH IN THE HALL
AND EXPECTATIONS OF MUCH MORE HE WAS A FRIEND OF ALYOSHA'S IN AN ANCIENT JOLTING BUT ROOMY HIRED CARRIAGE WITH A PAIR OF OLD PINKISH GRAY HORSES A LONG WAY BEHIND MIUESOV'S CARRIAGE
HE READ A LITTLE BUT DIDN'T LIKE IT HE DID NOT ONCE SMILE AND ENDED BY FROWNING WHY ISN'T IT FUNNY ASKED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SMERDYAKOV DID NOT SPEAK ANSWER STUPID
