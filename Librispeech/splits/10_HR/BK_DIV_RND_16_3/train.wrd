WHO WOULD HAVE NO SUCH STANDARDS
JUST AS THERE IS PLANTS CONTINUED MISSUS TODD WHO WAS NOTHING IF NOT BOTANICAL I KNOW OF JUST ONE SPRIG OF LAUREL THAT GROWS OVER BACK HERE IN A WILD SPOT
AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
WE MADE WHAT SPEED WE COULD TO GET CLEAR OF HUDSON'S BAY AND OFF THE COAST I OWNED AN EIGHTH OF THE VESSEL AND HE OWNED A SIXTEENTH OF HER SHE WAS A FULL RIGGED SHIP CALLED THE MINERVA BUT SHE WAS GETTING OLD AND LEAKY
AND THE CREW DONE THEIR WORK BY DINT OF HARD DRIVING I BEGAN TO FIND THIS UNEXPECTED NARRATIVE A LITTLE DULL CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF SLOW CORRECTNESS THAT LACKED THE LONGSHORE HIGH FLAVOR TO WHICH I HAD GROWN USED
SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MOMENT THAT WHEN I HEARD MISSUS TODD LAUGHING BEHIND US IN THE KITCHEN I LAUGHED TOO BUT WILLIAM DID NOT EVEN BLUSH I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE DEAF AND HE STEPPED ALONG
WAS ALL SETTING IN MEETING A DREADFUL HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND A SCATTER WITTED LITTLE BOUND GIRL CAME RUNNING TO THE MEETIN' HOUSE DOOR ALL OUT O BREATH FROM SOMEWHERES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MIS BOWDEN MIS BOWDEN
I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
IN BOTH HER APPEARANCE AND HER CHARMING GIFTS
THAT ANY OCCASION OF GENERAL INTEREST PROVES TO BE LESS THAN GREAT SUCH IS THE HIDDEN FIRE OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE NEW ENGLAND NATURE THAT ONCE GIVEN AN OUTLET IT SHINES FORTH
AND STRAYING OUT PRESENTLY I FOUND THE HOE BY THE WELL HOUSE AND AN OLD SPLINT BASKET AT THE WOODSHED DOOR AND ALSO FOUND MY WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT SQUARE PATCH OF ROUGH WEEDY POTATO TOPS AND TALL RAGWEED
SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
I EXPECT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSE A SOMEWHAT LARGER FISH BUT I'LL TRY AN MAKE IT DO I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA POTATOES BUT THERE'S A FIELD FULL OUT THERE AN THE HOE'S LEANIN AGAINST THE WELL HOUSE
WHICH THE BOYS AND GIRLS MADE WE BROUGHT FLOWERS FROM THE FENCE THICKETS OF THE GREAT FIELD AND OUT OF THE DISORDER OF FLOWERS AND PROVISIONS SUDDENLY APPEARED AS ORDERLY A SCHEME FOR THE FEAST AS THE MARSHAL HAD SHAPED FOR THE PROCESSION
THERE WAS A FLASHING OF WHITE GULLS OVER THE WATER WHERE THE FLEET OF BOATS RODE THE LOW WAVES TOGETHER IN THE COVE SWAYING THEIR SMALL MASTS AS IF THEY KEPT TIME TO OUR STEPS
I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
THERE NEVER WAS A MORE GENEROUS OUT OF DOOR FEAST ALONG THE COAST THEN THE BOWDEN FAMILY SET FORTH THAT DAY TO CALL IT A PICNIC WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL
GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
HE IS GREATER EVEN THAN A KING OR A SCHOOLMASTER CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE MOVED HIS CHAIR OUT OF THE WAKE OF THE SUNSHINE AND STILL SAT LOOKING AT ME I BEGAN TO BE VERY EAGER TO KNOW UPON WHAT ERRAND HE HAD COME
THE OLD BOWDEN HOUSE STOOD LOW STORIED AND BROAD ROOFED IN ITS GREEN FIELDS AS IF IT WERE A MOTHERLY BROWN HEN WAITING FOR THE FLOCK THAT CAME STRAYING TOWARD IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION THE FIRST BOWDEN SETTLER
TO THE POETS I WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH A SHIPMASTER THAT WAS ALL FOR BEES AN BEEKEEPIN AND IF YOU MET HIM IN PORT AND WENT ABOARD HE'D SIT
IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
WITH ALMOST VOLCANIC LIGHT AND HEAT IN QUIET NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH INWARD FORCE DOES NOT WASTE ITSELF UPON THOSE PETTY EXCITEMENTS OF EVERY DAY THAT BELONG TO CITIES
BUT THEY WERE NOT MANY SO I SAID TO MYSELF THEIR ANCESTORS MAY HAVE SAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF SOME OLD FRENCH HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN BATTLES AND SIEGES AND PROCESSIONS AND FEASTS
SHE STOOD UP IN THE HIGH WAGON TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN SHE TOOK FAST HOLD OF MY HAND HADN'T YOU BETTER URGE THE HORSE A LITTLE ALMIRY SHE ASKED HE'S HAD IT EASY AS WE CAME ALONG
THE MINISTER STOOD THERE IN THE PULPIT TRYIN TO KEEP SOBER AN ALL AT ONCE HE BURST RIGHT OUT LAUGHIN HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN THEY SAID AND HE SAID HE'D BETTER GIVE EM THE BENEDICTION AND THEY COULD HEAR THE SERMON NEXT SUNDAY
THAT WHEN YOU CALL UPON THE BOWDENS YOU MAY EXPECT MOST FAMILIES TO RISE UP BETWEEN THE LANDING AND THE FAR END OF THE BACK COVE THOSE THAT AREN'T KIN BY BLOOD ARE KIN BY MARRIAGE
LAND SAKES ALIVE
SHE ADDED WISTFULLY WE ALWAYS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHY IF IT IS A GOOD PLEASANT DAY TOMORROW
HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
AND TALK A TERRIBLE WHILE ABOUT THEIR HAVIN SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF KEEPIN EM HE WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST CAPTAINS
AN IT SEEMED AS IF DIE I SHOULD POOR NATHAN SAW SOMETHIN HAD CROSSED ME HE HAD VERY NICE FEELINGS
I ALWAYS DID THINK MARI HARRIS RESEMBLED A CHINEE MARI HARRIS WAS PRETTY AS A CHILD I REMEMBER SAID THE PLEASANT VOICE OF MISSUS BLACKETT WHO AFTER RECEIVING THE AFFECTIONATE GREETINGS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE COMPANY
THESE BICYCLES OFFEND ME DREADFULLY THEY DON'T AFFORD NO REAL OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCE SUCH AS A MAN GAINED ON A VOYAGE NO WHEN FOLKS LEFT HOME IN THE OLD DAYS THEY LEFT IT TO SOME PURPOSE
SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
IN ALL THESE THERE WERE STRAGGLING PROCESSIONS WALKING IN SINGLE FILE LIKE OLD ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THERE WAS A CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE AS IF HUGE BEES WERE SWARMING IN THE LILAC BUSHES
WERE FAMILIAR THINGS THE MINISTERS AND MISSUS BLACKETT WITH A FEW OF THEIR RANK AND AGE WERE PUT IN PLACES OF HONOR AND FOR ONCE THAT I LOOKED ANY OTHER WAY I LOOKED TWICE AT MISSUS BLACKETT'S FACE
I WAS SURE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT MUST BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY TO SLICE THE POTATOES INTO THE CHOWDER LAYER AFTER LAYER WITH THE FISH YOU LET ME TAKE HOLT O THAT BASKET MA'AM SAID THE PLEASANT ANXIOUS VOICE BEHIND ME I TURNED
STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
TWAS BORN IN HIM I DON'T KNOW'S HE EVER SAW A FINE PARADE OR MET WITH THOSE THAT STUDIED UP SUCH THINGS HE'S FIGURED IT ALL OUT AN GOT HIS PAPERS SO HE KNOWS HOW TO AIM A CANNON
WHILE EVERYBODY CROWDED ROUND TO GIVE THEIR WELCOME MOTHER'S ALWAYS THE QUEEN SAID MISSUS TODD YES THEY'LL ALL MAKE EVERYTHING OF MOTHER SHE'LL HAVE A LOVELY TIME TO DAY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD HER MISS IT
SHOWED ME THE STONE WALLED BURYING GROUND THAT STOOD LIKE A LITTLE FORT ON A KNOLL OVERLOOKING THE BAY BUT AS SHE SAID THERE WERE PLENTY OF SCATTERED BOWDENS WHO WERE NOT LAID THERE SOME LOST AT SEA AND SOME OUT WEST
HE'LL KNOW YOU NEED HIM FOR SOMETHING PARTICULAR AN THEN WE CAN CALL TO HIM AS HE COMES UP THE PATH I WON'T PUT HIM TO NO PAIN MISSUS BLACKETT'S OLD FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
WITH A SIMPLE KINDNESS THAT WAS THE SOUL OF CHIVALRY WAITED UPON US AND OUR BASKETS AND LED AWAY THE WHITE HORSE I ALREADY KNEW SOME OF MISSUS TODD'S FRIENDS AND KINDRED AND FELT LIKE AN ADOPTED BOWDEN IN THIS HAPPY MOMENT
YOUR BABY'S IN A FIT THEY USED TO TELL THAT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION WAS UP ON ITS FEET IN A MINUTE AND RIGHT OUT INTO THE AISLES ALL THE MIS BOWDENS WAS SETTING RIGHT OUT FOR HOME
AND HE CAN REST WHEN WE GET THERE THE OTHERS ARE SOME LITTLE WAYS AHEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A MINUTE WE WATCHED THE BOATS DROP THEIR SAILS ONE BY ONE IN THE COVE AS WE DROVE ALONG THE HIGH LAND
FOR JUST THAT CLASS O MEN
SOMEBODY OBSERVED ONCE THAT YOU COULD PICK OUT THE LIKENESS OF MOST EVERY SORT OF A FOREIGNER WHEN YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU IN OUR PARISH SAID SISTER CAPLIN HER FACE BRIGHTENING WITH SUDDEN ILLUMINATION I DIDN'T SEE THE BEARIN OF IT THEN QUITE SO PLAIN
AND THE SHADE WAS PLEASANT AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL WILLIAM STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO SHOW ME A GREAT WASPS' NEST CLOSE BY OR SOME FISHHAWKS' NESTS BELOW IN A BIT OF SWAMP
HE COULDN'T DO NOTHIN WITH EM ALL HE THINKS OF WHEN HE SEES A CROWD IS HOW TO MARCH EM TIS ALL VERY WELL WHEN HE DON'T TEMPT TOO MUCH HE NEVER DID ACT LIKE OTHER FOLKS
SMALL COMPANIES WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UP THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FROM THE WATER AND NEARLY ALL THE BOATS HAD COME TO SHORE
THE EXCITEMENT OF AN UNEXPECTEDLY GREAT OCCASION WAS A SUBTLE STIMULANT TO HER DISPOSITION AND I COULD SEE THAT SOMETIMES WHEN MISSUS TODD HAD SEEMED LIMITED AND HEAVILY DOMESTIC
OUT OF THE CHATTERING CROWD OF NOISY CHILDREN AND LARGE WAISTED WOMEN WHOSE BEST BLACK DRESSES FELL STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND IN GENEROUS FOLDS AND SUNBURNT MEN WHO LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS IF IT WERE TOWN MEETING DAY
AIN'T I JUST BEEN MAINTAININ THAT HE AIN'T LIKE EM URGED MISSUS TODD DECIDEDLY STRANGE FOLKS HAS GOT TO HAVE STRANGE WAYS FOR WHAT I SEE
I TOLD HIM I NEVER COULD LIKE HER MYSELF SAID HE YOU SHA'N'T BE BOTHERED DEAR HE SAYS AN TWAS ONE O THE THINGS THAT MADE ME SET A GOOD DEAL BY NATHAN
THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM MISSUS TODD'S USUAL LARGENESS OF MIND THAT I HAD A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS BUT THE CLOUD PASSED QUICKLY OVER HER SPIRIT AND WAS GONE WITH THE OFFENDER
ANSWERED MISSUS TODD HE'S A GOOD SIGHT BETTER COMPANY THOUGH DREAMY THAN SUCH SORDID CREATUR'S AS MARI HARRIS LIVE AND LET LIVE SAID DEAR OLD MISSUS BLACKETT GENTLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE
ONE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES THAT MAN HAS EVER MADE NOW WE WERE APPROACHING DANGEROUS GROUND BUT A SUDDEN SENSE OF HIS SUFFERINGS AT THE HANDS OF THE IGNORANT CAME TO MY HELP AND I ASKED TO HEAR MORE WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE I REALLY FELT
I COULD FEEL THAT MISSUS TODD'S EYES WERE UPON US AS WE APPROACHED THE HOUSE AND ALTHOUGH I FELL BEHIND IN THE NARROW PATH AND LET WILLIAM TAKE THE BASKET ALONE AND PRECEDE ME AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THE REST OF THE WAY
RIGHT FOR WILLIAM'S FISH HOUSE FIVE MILES OUT ON GREEN ISLAND OR UP THERE ON BURNT ISLAND WHERE THE SIGNAL IS HE HAD IT ALL OVER TO ME ONE DAY AN I TRIED HARD TO APPEAR INTERESTED HIS LIFE'S ALL IN IT
THEY FANCY THAT THEY COMPREHEND THE UNIVERSE I SMILED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO GO ON
BUT WE COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE WATER ON A BEACH BELOW IT SOUNDED LIKE THE STRANGE WARNING WAVE THAT GIVES NOTICE OF THE TURN OF THE TIDE
THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE UNKINDLY WANDERING HE CEASED TO SPEAK
HE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF HIS GIFTS SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A FRIEND FROM THE LANDING WHO HAD JOINED US THAT'S SANT BOWDEN HE ALWAYS TAKES THE LEAD SUCH DAYS
BUT WHEN AT LONG INTERVALS THE ALTARS TO PATRIOTISM TO FRIENDSHIP TO THE TIES OF KINDRED ARE REARED IN OUR FAMILIAR FIELDS THEN THE FIRES GLOW THE FLAMES COME UP
MISSUS TODD TURNED TO ME WITH A LOVELY LOOK OF TRIUMPH AND SELF FORGETFULNESS AN ELDERLY MAN WHO WORE THE LOOK OF A PROSPEROUS SEA CAPTAIN PUT UP BOTH ARMS
HE COPIED LIFE BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LOW TALK I NOW REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS TODD HAD TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE HAD OVERSET HIS MIND WITH TOO MUCH READING
I SAID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVICEABLE
THE SKY THE SEA HAVE WATCHED POOR HUMANITY AT ITS RITES SO LONG WE WERE NO MORE A NEW ENGLAND FAMILY CELEBRATING ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND SIMPLE PROGRESS
YES SAYS I BUT THINK O THANKSGIVIN TIMES AN FUNERALS SHE'S OUR RELATION AN WE'VE GOT TO OWN HER YOUNG FOLKS DON'T THINK O THOSE THINGS
WE'RE ALL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND GOING BACK YEAR BY YEAR OH NO CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I HOPE NOT SAID I TRYING TO SOOTHE HIS FEELINGS THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE
SO HE KEPT IT OVER MY MOTHER WAS THERE AND SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN TWAS ME NONE OF OUR FAMILY WAS EVER SUBJECT TO FITS INTERRUPTED MISSUS TODD SEVERELY NO
THERE THEY'RE CALLIN OUT IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLES SAID MISSUS CAPLIN WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT HERE'S COUSIN SARAH JANE BLACKETT WELL I AM PLEASED CERTAIN
WE RANKED BY FOURS AND EVEN THEN WE MADE A LONG PROCESSION THERE WAS A WIDE PATH MOWED FOR US ACROSS THE FIELD AND AS WE MOVED ALONG
AT LAST TO TURN OUT OF THE STONY HIGHROAD INTO A GREEN LANE SHADED WITH OLD APPLE TREES MISSUS TODD ENCOURAGED THE HORSE UNTIL HE FAIRLY PRANCED WITH GAYETY AS WE DROVE ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE ON THE SOFT TURF
AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED FROM LONELINESS AND MISAPPREHENSION HE LOOKED WITH HIS CAREFUL PRECISION OF DRESS AS IF HE WERE THE OBJECT OF CHERISHING CARE ON THE PART OF ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS
I'VE GOT NEW DOUGHNUTS DEAR SAID THE LITTLE OLD LADY
AND THERE WON'T BE A THING SHE'LL EVER REGRET EXCEPT TO MOURN BECAUSE WILLIAM WA'N'T HERE MISSUS BLACKETT HAVING BEEN PROPERLY ESCORTED TO THE HOUSE MISSUS TODD RECEIVED HER OWN FULL SHARE OF HONOR AND SOME OF THE MEN
THROUGH THIS PIECE OF ROUGH PASTURE RAN A HUGE SHAPE OF STONE LIKE THE GREAT BACKBONE OF AN ENORMOUS CREATURE AT THE END NEAR THE WOODS WE COULD CLIMB UP ON IT AND WALK ALONG TO THE HIGHEST POINT
TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
BUT I LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE EXPLAINED THE WINDS HAVING BECOME CONTRARY AND TALKED ON IN A DREARY SORT OF WAY ABOUT HIS VOYAGE THE BAD WEATHER AND THE DISADVANTAGES HE WAS UNDER IN THE LIGHTNESS OF HIS SHIP WHICH BOUNCED ABOUT LIKE A CHIP IN A BUCKET
EXCEPT FROM A CHEAP UNPRINCIPLED NEWSPAPER IN THE OLD DAYS A GOOD PART O THE BEST MEN HERE KNEW A HUNDRED PORTS AND SOMETHING OF THE WAY FOLKS LIVED IN THEM THEY SAW THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES
WORE A LOOK OF TROUBLE AND I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TEASING SPIRIT OF ALMIRA IT WAS TOO PLEASANT TO STAY INDOORS ALTOGETHER EVEN IN SUCH REWARDING COMPANIONSHIP BESIDES I MIGHT MEET WILLIAM
WHILE DINNER WAS GETTING READY SO NOT WITHOUT A DEEP SENSE OF PLEASURE AND A DELIGHTED LOOK OF SURPRISE FROM THE TWO HOSTESSES WE STARTED WILLIAM AND I AS IF BOTH OF US FELT MUCH YOUNGER THAN WE LOOKED
THAT HE WAS LARGE AND STOUT LIKE HIS SISTER ALMIRA TODD AND STRANGE TO SAY MY FANCY HAD LED ME TO PICTURE HIM NOT FAR FROM THIRTY AND A LITTLE LOUTISH IT WAS NECESSARY INSTEAD TO PAY WILLIAM THE RESPECT DUE TO AGE
AND WHEN I MADE PORT AT LAST IT WAS TOO LATE TO DELAY IN THOSE NORTHERN WATERS WITH SUCH A VESSEL AND SUCH A CREW AS I HAD
I DO TRY TO REMEMBER THAT SHE'S NATHAN'S COUSIN OH DEAR WELL SHE'S GONE BY AFTER ALL AN AIN'T SEEN ME I EXPECTED SHE'D COME PLEASANTIN ROUND JUST TO SHOW OFF AN SAY AFTERWARDS SHE WAS ACQUAINTED
JUST AS THE DAY REACHED ITS HIGHEST POINT OF HEAT WE COULD SEE THE GREEN SUNLIT FIELD WE HAD JUST CROSSED AS IF WE LOOKED OUT AT IT FROM A DARK ROOM
AS I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE TABLES THERE WAS A GOOD CHEER A GRAVE SOBERNESS THAT SHONE WITH PLEASURE A HUMBLE DIGNITY OF BEARING THERE WERE SOME WHO SHOULD HAVE SAT BELOW THE SALT FOR LACK OF THIS GOOD BREEDING
SHIPPING'S A TERRIBLE LOSS TO THIS PART O NEW ENGLAND FROM A SOCIAL POINT O VIEW MA'AM I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF I RETURNED
HE QUOTED AS HE GAZED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE AND UP THE LONG WOODED SHORE THEN HE GLANCED AT ME AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS PLEASED AS A CHILD MY QUOTATION WAS FROM PARADISE LOST THE GREATEST OF POEMS
AND THE SHEEP BELL TINKLED AWAY IN HASTE AS IF SOMEONE HAD SHAKEN A STICK IN ITS WEARER'S FACE THEN I LOOKED AND SAW CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE PASSING THE NEAREST WINDOW THE NEXT MOMENT HE TAPPED POLITELY AT THE DOOR COME IN SIR
HEADIN FOR HUDSON'S STRAITS I HAD A BAD TURN O SOME SORT O FEVER AND HAD TO STAY BELOW THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT AND WE MADE GOOD RUNS ALL WELL ON BOARD BUT ME
HE HAD THE REFINEMENT OF LOOK AND AIR OF COMMAND WHICH ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL FAMILIES OF NEW ENGLAND BUT AS DARWIN SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THERE IS NO SUCH KING AS A SEA CAPTAIN
AND LIFTED MISSUS BLACKETT DOWN FROM THE HIGH WAGON LIKE A CHILD AND KISSED HER WITH HEARTY AFFECTION I WAS MASTER AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE HE SAID LOOKING AT MISSUS TODD WITH A FACE LIKE A HAPPY SUNBURNT SCHOOLBOY
HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
AFTER A SEASON OF REFLECTION WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE FEAST TO BEGIN
TWILL BRING OUT A GOOD MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS TIS SUCH A LOVELY DAY I'M ALWAYS GLAD NOT TO HAVE THEM DISAPPOINTED
I'VE HAD TO FAVOR OLD MIS EVINS WITH DRYIN YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS ALL THEM EVINS FOLKS THERE JUST YOU LOOK UP TO THE CROSSROADS MOTHER SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SEE ALL THE TEAMS AHEAD OF US
AND HELD IT CAPTIVE ONE SEES EXACTLY THE SAME TYPES IN A COUNTRY GATHERING AS IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CITY COMPANY
THERE WAS A THICK GROWTH OF DARK PINES AND FIRS WITH AN OCCASIONAL MAPLE OR OAK THAT GAVE A GLEAM OF COLOR LIKE A BRIGHT WINDOW IN THE GREAT ROOF ON THREE SIDES WE COULD SEE THE WATER SHINING BEHIND THE TREE TRUNKS
I LONGED TO GO ON BUT IT DID NOT SEEM FRUGAL TO DIG ANY LONGER AFTER MY BASKET WAS FULL AND AT LAST I TOOK MY HOE BY THE MIDDLE AND LIFTED THE BASKET TO GO BACK UP THE HILL
MY EXPERIENCE UPON A CERTAIN OCCASION I MIGHT SAY
AND LENDS SOME BEAUTY TO THE PLAINEST FACE OH I EXPECT I SHALL MEET FRIENDS TODAY THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG WHILE SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH DEEP SATISFACTION
TURNED AWAY TO HIDE THE FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT INSTANTLY CONTROL WHO WAS THE MARSHAL I HASTENED TO ASK WAS HE AN OLD SOLDIER DON'T HE DO WELL ANSWERED MISSUS TODD WITH SATISFACTION
OVER TO THE PORT THEY ALWAYS INVITE HIM TO MARCH DECORATION DAY SAME AS THE REST AN HE DOES LOOK NOBLE HE COMES OF SOLDIER STOCK
EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE READY TO MARCH TOGETHER A PRETTY FLOCK AND AT THE LAST MOMENT MISSUS BLACKETT AND A FEW DISTINGUISHED COMPANIONS THE MINISTERS AND THOSE WHO WERE VERY OLD CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND TOOK THEIR PLACES
AND SOME WHO DIED IN THE WAR MOST OF THE HOME GRAVES WERE THOSE OF WOMEN WE COULD SEE NOW THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENT FOOTPATHS FROM ALONG SHORE AND ACROSS COUNTRY
THE UNUSED PROVISION OF EVERY SORT THE RESERVE FORCE OF SOCIETY GROWS MORE AND MORE AMAZING TO ONE'S THOUGHT MORE THAN ONE FACE AMONG THE BOWDENS SHOWED THAT ONLY OPPORTUNITY AND STIMULUS WERE LACKING
AND WENT TO BOSTON TO VOLUNTEER BUT HE AIN'T A SOUND MAN AN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HIM THEY SAY HE KNOWS ALL THEIR TACTICS AN CAN TELL ALL ABOUT THE BATTLE O WATERLOO WELL'S HE CAN BUNKER HILL
HE PICKED A FEW SPRIGS OF LATE BLOOMING LINNAEA AS WE CAME OUT UPON AN OPEN BIT OF PASTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND AND GAVE THEM TO ME WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT HE KNEW AS WELL AS I THAT ONE COULD NOT SAY HALF HE WISHED ABOUT LINNAEA
BUT HE WILL HAVE THOSE POOR GLOOMY SPELLS COME OVER HIM NOW AN THEN AN THEN HE HAS TO DRINK MISSUS CAPLIN GAVE A HEAVY SIGH THERE'S A GREAT MANY SUCH STRAYAWAY FOLKS
I WISH THEY WERE SITTIN WITH US THEY'RE NOT AMONG FOLKS THEY CAN PARLEY WITH AN THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED AS THE FEAST WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF MY COMPANION STEADILY ROSE
AND SOME WERE GREAT ON MEDICINE
BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
I COUNTED THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BAFFLED BY THE LIGHT BREEZE BUT BEFORE LONG ALL THE BOWDENS SMALL AND GREAT SEEMED TO HAVE ASSEMBLED AND WE STARTED TO GO UP TO THE GROVE ACROSS THE FIELD
AN I NEVER COULD HEAR OF NO OTHER ON THIS COAST I HAD A LARGE BUNCH BROUGHT ME ONCE FROM MASSACHUSETTS WAY SO I KNOW IT THIS PIECE GROWS IN AN OPEN SPOT WHERE YOU'D THINK TWOULD DO WELL BUT IT'S SORT O POOR LOOKIN
COMPANY'S SAKE IN DULL DAYS AND NIGHTS HE TURNS TO HIS BOOK MOST OF US OLD SHIPMASTERS CAME TO KNOW MOST EVERYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING
I FOUND MYSELF THINKING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE CARRYING GREEN BRANCHES AND SINGING AS WE WENT
THE BIRDS FLEW UP OUT OF THE THICK SECOND CROP OF CLOVER AND THE BEES HUMMED
SUCH A DAY AS THIS HAS TRANSFIGURING POWERS AND EASILY MAKES FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN COLD HEARTED AND GIVES TO THOSE WHO ARE DUMB THEIR CHANCE TO SPEAK
WILLIAM MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN THE ONION OUT OF HER BASKET AND LAID IT DOWN UPON THE KITCHEN TABLE THERE'S JOHNNY BOWDEN COME WITH US YOU KNOW SHE REMINDED HER MOTHER HE'LL BE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT HIS SIZE
I BEGAN TO RESPECT THE BOWDENS FOR THEIR INHERITANCE OF GOOD TASTE AND SKILL AND A CERTAIN PLEASING GIFT OF FORMALITY SOMETHING MADE THEM DO ALL THESE THINGS IN A FINER WAY THAN MOST COUNTRY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE THEM
IN MONGST THE CLIMBIN' BEANS SHE SMILED
WE CARRIED THE TOKENS AND INHERITANCE OF ALL SUCH HOUSEHOLDS FROM WHICH THIS HAD DESCENDED AND WERE ONLY THE LATEST OF OUR LINE WE POSSESSED THE INSTINCTS OF A FAR FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD
THOSE WHO HAVE LAUGHED AT ME LITTLE KNOW HOW MUCH REASON MY IDEAS ARE BASED UPON HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE VILLAGE BELOW
NO SANTIN NEVER WAS IN THE WAR SAID MISSUS TODD WITH LOFTY INDIFFERENCE IT WAS A CAUSE OF REAL DISTRESS TO HIM HE KEP ENLISTIN AND TRAVELED FAR AN WIDE ABOUT HERE AN EVEN TOOK THE BO'T
THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
THAT OUR FAMILY CAME OF VERY HIGH FOLKS IN FRANCE AND ONE OF EM WAS A GREAT GENERAL IN SOME O THE OLD WARS I SOMETIMES THINK THAT SANTIN'S ABILITY HAS COME WAY DOWN FROM THEN TAIN'T NOTHIN HE'S EVER ACQUIRED
AMIABILITY TWAS MOST TOO BAD TO CRAMP HIM DOWN TO HIS PEACEFUL TRADE BUT HE'S A MOST EXCELLENT SHOEMAKER AT HIS BEST AN HE ALWAYS SAYS IT'S A TRADE THAT GIVES HIM TIME TO THINK AN PLAN HIS MANEUVERS
I FELT SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND RESPONSIBLE BUT WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY WERE ON MOST SIMPLE AND FRIENDLY TERMS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT WITH WILLIAM IT WAS THE FIRST STEP THAT COST AND THAT HAVING ONCE JOINED IN SOCIAL INTERESTS
THERE WAS NO MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATION UNTIL WE WERE SEATED IN ORDER AT THE LONG TABLES I'M ONE THAT ALWAYS DREADS SEEING SOME O THE FOLKS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
STARTLED IN THE SILENCE OF THE WIDE FIELD AND SAW AN ELDERLY MAN BENT IN THE SHOULDERS AS FISHERMEN OFTEN ARE GRAY HEADED AND CLEAN SHAVEN AND WITH A TIMID AIR IT WAS WILLIAM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I HAD BEEN IMAGINING
NEVER'D LOOK SO DISCONSOLATE IF SHE WAS ANY SORT OF A PROPER PERSON TO DIRECT THINGS SHE MIGHT DIVERT HIM YES SHE MIGHT DIVERT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AN LET HIM THINK HE HAD HIS OWN WAY STEAD O ARGUING EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE BARE BONE
RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURE MEASUREMENTS SAME'S OTHER SAILORS MAKE LITTLE SHIPS AND DESIGN NEW TRICKS OF RIGGING
WHICH WAS BUT THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM HER BEAMING COUNTENANCE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS FULL OF WONDER AT THE WASTE OF HUMAN ABILITY IN THIS WORLD AS A BOTANIST WONDERS AT THE WASTEFULNESS OF NATURE THE THOUSAND SEEDS THAT DIE
I WA'N'T CAUGHT ASTERN O THE LIGHTER
THE GREATER PART OF MY LIFE FORTY THREE YEARS IN ALL YOU MAY NOT THINK IT BUT I AM ABOVE EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
WITH A LIGHT PAIR O HEELS BUT I HAD BEEN VEXED TO DEATH WITH THEIR RED TAPE RIGGING AT THE COMPANY'S OFFICE AND CHILLED WITH STAYIN ON DECK AN TRYIN TO HURRY UP THINGS AND WHEN WE WERE WELL OUT O SIGHT O LAND
THERE SUDDENLY CAME SILENCE AND ORDER I SAW THE STRAIGHT SOLDIERLY LITTLE FIGURE OF A MAN WHO BORE A FINE RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS BLACKETT AND WHO APPEARED TO MARSHAL US WITH PERFECT EASE HE WAS IMPERATIVE ENOUGH
AS IF FROM THE INEXHAUSTIBLE BURNING HEART OF THE EARTH THE PRIMAL FIRES BREAK THROUGH THE GRANITE DUST IN WHICH OUR SOULS ARE SET EACH HEART IS WARM AND EVERY FACE SHINES WITH THE ANCIENT LIGHT
I HAD BEEN NOTICING WITH GREAT INTEREST THE CURIOUSLY FRENCH TYPE OF FACE WHICH PREVAILED IN THIS RUSTIC COMPANY I HAD SAID TO MYSELF BEFORE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT WAS PLAINLY OF FRENCH DESCENT
NOW THERE WAS A PLEASANT LOOK OF SHADE AND SHELTER THERE FOR THE GREAT FAMILY MEETING WE HURRIED ON OUR WAY BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF WE WERE VERY LATE AND IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION
THERE WAS AN INSTANT CRY OF REJOICING AND TWO OR THREE PERSONS RAN TOWARD US FROM THE BUSY GROUP WHY DEAR MIS BLACKETT HERE'S MIS BLACKETT I HEARD THEM SAY AS IF IT WERE PLEASURE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO HAVE A SIGHT OF HER
AND THEY'D BEEN TREATED TO A SERMON ON FAITH AN WORKS FROM OLD FAYTHER HARLOW THAT NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO CEASE TWA'N'T NO TIME FOR TACTICS THEN THEY WA'N'T A'THINKIN OF THE CHURCH MILITARY SANT
I SAID RISING TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED BOWING WITH MUCH COURTESY I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE DESK AND OFFERED HIM A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT ONCE BEING SADLY SPENT BY HIS CLIMB
EXCLAIMED MISSUS TODD WITH UNAFFECTED DELIGHT AND THESE KINDRED SPIRITS MET AND PARTED WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TALK LATER ON AFTER THIS
CONFERENCE IN PLATOONS AND GOT EM ALL FLUSTERED UP TRYIN TO SENSE HIS IDEAS OF A HOLLER SQUARE SHE BURST FORTH
WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
AND FEEL THE COOL SALT BREEZE
BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
AND WOULD NOT ANSWER THE RUDDER OR PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE MOST CAREFUL SETTING OF SAILS SO THERE WE WERE BLOWIN ALONG ANYWAYS HE COMPLAINED
WE NEVER HAD FITS NONE OF US AND TWAS LUCKY WE DIDN'T WAY OUT THERE TO GREEN ISLAND NOW THESE FOLKS RIGHT IN FRONT
I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT IN SEARCH OF ME THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HIS APPEARANCE IT WAS A FACE THIN AND DELICATE WITH REFINEMENT BUT WORN INTO APPEALING LINES
SAID MISSUS TODD WITH AN ALARMING TRANSITION FROM GENERAL OPINIONS TO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITIES I HATE HER JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DID
BUT THEY WERE SOME ACQUAINTED WITH FOREIGN LANDS AN THEIR LAWS AN COULD SEE OUTSIDE THE BATTLE FOR TOWN CLERK HERE IN DUNNET THEY GOT SOME SENSE O PROPORTION YES THEY LIVED MORE DIGNIFIED AND THEIR HOUSES WERE BETTER WITHIN AN WITHOUT
AND THE OLD HOUSE AND ITS LILACS STANDING PLACIDLY IN THE SUN AND THE GREAT BARN WITH A STOCKADE OF CARRIAGES FROM WHICH TWO OR THREE CARE TAKING MEN WHO HAD LINGERED WERE COMING ACROSS THE FIELD TOGETHER
BUT I BELIEVED THAT MISSUS TODD WOULD FIND IT INACCESSIBLE UNLESS SHE HAD OCCASION TO SEEK ME IN GREAT HASTE I WROTE ON FEELING LIKE A BESIEGED MISER OF TIME WHILE THE FOOTSTEPS CAME NEARER
HAD MADE HIS HOME THERE AND IT WAS STILL THE BOWDEN FARM FIVE GENERATIONS OF SAILORS AND FARMERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BEEN ITS CHILDREN AND PRESENTLY MISSUS BLACKETT
AND LIKE'S NOT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN SAW IT WITH THEM
I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
AND BEAT ITSELF AGAINST THE WALLS FOR A MINUTE AND ESCAPED AGAIN TO THE OPEN AIR BUT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE FLURRY I HAD A VALUABLE CARGO
BUT WITH A GRAND MILITARY SORT OF COURTESY AND BORE HIMSELF WITH SOLEMN DIGNITY OF IMPORTANCE WE WERE SORTED OUT ACCORDING TO SOME CLEAR DESIGN OF HIS OWN AND STOOD AS SPEECHLESS AS A TROOP TO AWAIT HIS ORDERS
AND OH LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY YES LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY SEE WHAT A SIGHT O BOATS ALL HEADIN FOR THE BOWDEN PLACE COVE OH AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH ALL THE DELIGHT OF A GIRL
I ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO PLAIN FACTS ON THE INSTANT AND WE SAID GOOD MORNING LIKE OLD FRIENDS THE BASKET WAS REALLY HEAVY AND I PUT THE HOE THROUGH ITS HANDLE AND OFFERED HIM ONE END
HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT
ONE CORNER WAS ALREADY DUG AND I CHOSE A FAT LOOKING HILL WHERE THE TOPS WERE WELL WITHERED THERE IS ALL THE PLEASURE THAT ONE CAN HAVE IN GOLD DIGGING IN FINDING ONE'S HOPES SATISFIED IN THE RICHES OF A GOOD HILL OF POTATOES
I VIEW IT IN ADDITION THAT A COMMUNITY NARROWS DOWN AND GROWS DREADFUL IGNORANT WHEN IT IS SHUT UP TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND GETS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
YET STILL BE HEARD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OF ANCIENT GREEKS GOING TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OR TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF HARVESTS IN THE GROVE ABOVE IT WAS STRANGELY MOVING TO SEE THIS AND TO MAKE PART OF IT
THE SUPERFICIAL EXPLANATION IS THAT A GOVERNMENT RESTING UPON POPULAR SUFFRAGE CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL UNLESS THOSE WHO ELECT AND WHO OBEY THEIR GOVERNORS ARE EDUCATED SINCE A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY REPUDIATES THE PRINCIPLE OF EXTERNAL AUTHORITY
IT MUST FIND A SUBSTITUTE IN VOLUNTARY DISPOSITION AND INTEREST THESE CAN BE CREATED ONLY BY EDUCATION BUT THERE IS A DEEPER EXPLANATION A DEMOCRACY IS MORE THAN A FORM OF GOVERNMENT IT IS PRIMARILY A MODE OF ASSOCIATED LIVING
STUBBORNNESS SHOWS ITSELF EVEN MORE IN RELUCTANCE TO CRITICIZE ENDS WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES THAN IT DOES IN
THERE BEING NO RECOGNITION THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTES HIS OWN CLASS THERE COULD BE NO RECOGNITION OF THE INFINITE DIVERSITY OF ACTIVE TENDENCIES AND COMBINATIONS OF TENDENCIES OF WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL IS CAPABLE
WORKS SO TO SPEAK IN REASON NOT SIMPLY BY EVEN THE ACTIVITY OF THE CITIZEN IN HIS CIVIC RELATIONS IN OTHER WORDS RETAINS SOME OF THE TAINT OF PRACTICE
BARRING THE FACT OF SOCIALLY DIVIDED CLASSES LEAD TO NEGLECT OF THE KIND OF EDUCATION WHICH TRAINS MEN FOR THE USEFUL PURSUITS IT WOULD RATHER LEAD TO SCRUPULOUS CARE FOR THEM SO THAT MEN WERE TRAINED TO BE EFFICIENT IN THEM
THE DIFFERENCE IMAGINATIVELY FORESEEN MAKES A PRESENT DIFFERENCE WHICH FINDS EXPRESSION IN SOLICITUDE AND EFFORT WHILE SUCH WORDS AS AFFECTION CONCERN AND MOTIVE INDICATE AN ATTITUDE OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE
AND THEIR PRACTICAL VALUE APPROACH THE SAME LIMIT DOUBTLESS THE FACTOR WHICH CHIEFLY PREVENTS OUR FULL RECOGNITION AND EMPLOYMENT OF THIS IDENTIFICATION IS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SO MUCH WORK IS STILL CARRIED ON
IN THE LONG RUN ITS VALUE IS MEASURED BY WHETHER IT SUPPLIES A MERE PHYSICAL EXCITATION TO ACT IN THE WAY DESIRED BY THE ADULT OR WHETHER IT LEADS THE CHILD TO THINK THAT IS TO REFLECT UPON HIS ACTS AND IMPREGNATE THEM WITH AIMS
A IN PART BODILY ACTIVITY BECOMES AN INTRUDER HAVING NOTHING SO IT IS THOUGHT TO DO WITH MENTAL ACTIVITY IT BECOMES A DISTRACTION AN EVIL TO BE CONTENDED WITH FOR THE PUPIL HAS A BODY
MAY LIVE THE LIFE OF LEISURELY CONCERN WITH THINGS INTRINSICALLY WORTH WHILE
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE ADEQUATELY THE EVIL RESULTS WHICH HAVE FLOWED FROM THIS DUALISM OF MIND AND BODY MUCH LESS TO EXAGGERATE THEM SOME OF THE MORE STRIKING EFFECTS MAY HOWEVER BE ENUMERATED
IT IS REASONABLE AS WE SAY THAT THE THING SHOULD HAPPEN AS IT DOES THINKING IS THUS EQUIVALENT TO AN EXPLICIT RENDERING OF THE INTELLIGENT ELEMENT IN OUR EXPERIENCE IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ACT WITH AN END IN VIEW
TO BE TURNED BACK TO FEED ON ITSELF THEIR ART BECOMES A SHOWY DISPLAY AND ARTIFICIAL THEIR WEALTH LUXURIOUS THEIR KNOWLEDGE OVERSPECIALIZED THEIR MANNERS FASTIDIOUS RATHER THAN HUMANE
OF THE MEANS FOR A FREE OR RATIONAL LIFE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY THERE IS A GULF BETWEEN MERELY LIVING AND LIVING WORTHILY IN ORDER THAT ONE MAY LIVE WORTHILY HE MUST FIRST LIVE
AND BRINGS IT TO SCHOOL ALONG WITH HIS MIND AND THE BODY IS OF NECESSITY A WELLSPRING OF ENERGY IT HAS TO DO SOMETHING BUT ITS ACTIVITIES NOT BEING UTILIZED IN OCCUPATION WITH THINGS WHICH YIELD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS
AND OUTER PHYSICAL ACTION OF WHICH THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LIBERAL AND THE UTILITARIAN IS THE REFLEX AN EDUCATION WHICH SHOULD UNIFY THE DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
HE HAD NO PERCEPTION OF THE UNIQUENESS OF INDIVIDUALS FOR HIM THEY FALL BY NATURE INTO CLASSES AND INTO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CLASSES AT THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE TESTING AND SIFTING FUNCTION OF EDUCATION
MUST SEE TO IT THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE EDUCATED TO PERSONAL INITIATIVE AND ADAPTABILITY OTHERWISE THEY WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE CHANGES IN WHICH THEY ARE CAUGHT AND WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE OR CONNECTIONS THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE
IN SUPPOSING THAT THERE IS A NATURAL DIVORCE BETWEEN EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCING COMMODITIES AND RENDERING SERVICE AND SELF DIRECTIVE THOUGHT BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICAL ACHIEVEMENT
IMPORTANT AS THESE THEORETICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHANGES ARE THEIR IMPORTANCE CONSISTS IN THEIR BEING TURNED TO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRULY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY A SOCIETY IN WHICH ALL SHARE IN USEFUL SERVICE
BUT THE REVOLUTION IS STILL INCOMPLETE THE IDEA STILL PREVAILS THAT A TRULY CULTURAL OR LIBERAL EDUCATION CANNOT HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON DIRECTLY AT LEAST WITH INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRS
A SEPARATION INTO A PRIVILEGED AND A SUBJECT CLASS PREVENTS SOCIAL ENDOSMOSIS THE EVILS THEREBY AFFECTING THE SUPERIOR CLASS ARE LESS MATERIAL AND LESS PERCEPTIBLE BUT EQUALLY REAL THEIR CULTURE TENDS TO BE STERILE
HENCEFORTH THE STICKING OF THE FINGER INTO FLAME MEANS A BURN BEING BURNED IS A MERE PHYSICAL CHANGE LIKE THE BURNING OF A STICK OF WOOD IF IT IS NOT PERCEIVED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SOME OTHER ACTION
BUT INTO AN ENFORCED DUTY NOT TO GIVE THEM FREE PLAY IT MAY BE SERIOUSLY ASSERTED THAT A CHIEF CAUSE FOR THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREEK EDUCATION WAS THAT IT WAS NEVER MISLED BY FALSE NOTIONS
TO SUBDUE INCLINATION TO COMPEL OBEDIENCE TO MORTIFY THE FLESH TO MAKE A SUBORDINATE PERFORM AN UNCONGENIAL TASK THESE THINGS ARE OR ARE NOT DISCIPLINARY ACCORDING AS THEY DO OR DO NOT
CHAPTER NINETEEN LABOR AND LEISURE ONE THE ORIGIN OF THE OPPOSITION
IN SO FAR THAT IS TO SAY AS AIMS ENDS ENTER INTO IT WITH SELECTION OF MEANS TO FURTHER THE ATTAINMENT OF AIMS
THERE IS OF COURSE SUCH A THING AS A SPECULATIVE TRACING OUT OF RESULTS ENDS ARE THEN FORESEEN BUT THEY DO NOT LAY DEEP HOLD OF A PERSON THEY ARE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND FOR CURIOSITY TO PLAY WITH RATHER THAN SOMETHING TO ACHIEVE
AS CONDITIONS PERMIT THAT IS THE EDUCATION WHICH HAD LEISURE MORE DIRECTLY IN VIEW SHOULD INDIRECTLY REINFORCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE ENJOYMENT OF WORK WHILE THAT AIMING AT THE LATTER
PROPORTIONATE VALUE IS VERY DIFFERENT HENCE THE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE CHANGES THE CHANGE IS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT WE MAY CALL THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE REFLECTIVE THAT IS REFLECTIVE PAR EXCELLENCE
IF THE MOST PRIZED RESULT OF THE CHANGE IS SIMPLY AN INCREASE IN THE MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY OF THE HUMAN TOOLS OF PRODUCTION SO WE LOSE RATHER THAN GAIN IN COMING TO THINK OF INTELLIGENCE
CHAPTER TEN INTEREST AND DISCIPLINE ONE THE MEANING OF THE TERMS WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ATTITUDE OF A SPECTATOR
THEY ARE ALWAYS ATTITUDES TOWARD OBJECTS TOWARD WHAT IS FORESEEN WE MAY CALL THE PHASE OF OBJECTIVE FORESIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND THE PHASE OF PERSONAL CONCERN
AND THE OTHER SERVILE IN ITS SOCIAL STATUS THE LATTER CLASS LABORED NOT ONLY FOR ITS OWN SUBSISTENCE BUT ALSO FOR THE MEANS WHICH ENABLED THE SUPERIOR CLASS TO LIVE WITHOUT PERSONALLY ENGAGING
THE FACT THAT A PROCESS TAKES TIME TO MATURE IS SO OBVIOUS A FACT THAT WE RARELY MAKE IT EXPLICIT WE OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT IN GROWTH THERE IS GROUND TO BE COVERED BETWEEN AN INITIAL STAGE OF PROCESS AND THE COMPLETING PERIOD
WHEN AN ACTIVITY IS CONTINUED INTO THE UNDERGOING OF CONSEQUENCES WHEN THE CHANGE MADE BY ACTION IS REFLECTED BACK INTO A CHANGE MADE IN US THE MERE FLUX IS LOADED WITH SIGNIFICANCE
BUT ALL NEEDS ALL DESIRES IMPLY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE A MATERIAL FACTOR THEY INVOLVE LACK PRIVATION THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON SOMETHING BEYOND THEMSELVES FOR COMPLETION
WHICH MAKES AN EXPERIENCE IN ANY VITAL SENSE OF THAT TERM ON THE OTHER HAND MANY THINGS HAPPEN TO US IN THE WAY OF PLEASURE AND PAIN WHICH WE DO NOT CONNECT WITH ANY PRIOR ACTIVITY OF OUR OWN
AND IGNORES THE CONNECTIONS OF OUR PERSONAL ACTION WITH THE ENERGIES OF THE ENVIRONMENT IT SAYS VIRTUALLY THINGS ARE TO BE JUST AS I HAPPEN TO LIKE THEM AT THIS INSTANT AS ROUTINE SAYS IN EFFECT
BRINGS ITS ANTISOCIAL SPIRIT INTO RELIEF
OBSTINACY IS PERSISTENCE BUT IT IS NOT STRENGTH OF VOLITION OBSTINACY MAY BE MERE ANIMAL INERTIA AND INSENSITIVENESS
MEAN THAT SELF AND WORLD ARE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER IN A DEVELOPING SITUATION THE WORD INTEREST IN ITS ORDINARY USAGE
IRRESPECTIVE OF ITS ULTERIOR EFFECT UPON THEIR CAPACITY TO SHARE IN A WORTHY LIFE
THE FACTORS OF THE OLDER HISTORIC SITUATION STILL PERSIST SUFFICIENTLY TO MAINTAIN THE EDUCATIONAL DISTINCTION ALONG WITH COMPROMISES WHICH OFTEN REDUCE THE EFFICACY OF THE EDUCATIONAL MEASURES
IN SEEKING THIS MEASURE WE HAVE TO AVOID TWO EXTREMES WE CANNOT SET UP OUT OF OUR HEADS SOMETHING WE REGARD AS AN IDEAL SOCIETY WE MUST BASE OUR CONCEPTION UPON SOCIETIES WHICH ACTUALLY EXIST
EMOTIONAL AND VOLITIONAL BUT THERE IS NO SEPARATION IN THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION SUCH A SEPARATION COULD EXIST ONLY IF THE PERSONAL ATTITUDES RAN THEIR COURSE IN A WORLD BY THEMSELVES
WHICH MADE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SEEM SERVILE TO THE GREEKS BUT THE FACT THAT THE ACTIVITIES DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH GETTING A LIVELIHOOD WERE NOT IN THEIR DAYS THE EXPRESSION OF A TRAINED INTELLIGENCE
HE CANNOT TO BE SURE BY HIS PRESENT REACTIONS AFFECT TO MORROW'S WEATHER BUT HE MAY TAKE SOME STEPS WHICH WILL INFLUENCE FUTURE HAPPENINGS IF ONLY TO POSTPONE THE PROPOSED PICNIC
GROUPS BOUND CLOSELY TOGETHER BY TIES OF BLOOD AND SO ON IN ENDLESS VARIETY IN MANY MODERN STATES AND IN SOME ANCIENT THERE IS GREAT DIVERSITY OF POPULATIONS OF VARYING LANGUAGES
AND A CULTURAL EMBELLISHMENT IN SHORT ABILITY TO TRANSCEND THE GREEK PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND EDUCATION IS NOT SECURED BY A MERE SHIFTING ABOUT OF THE THEORETICAL SYMBOLS MEANING FREE RATIONAL AND WORTHY
AND SCIENCE WHEN LABORATORY EXERCISES ARE GIVEN FOR THEIR OWN SAKE SUFFER FROM THE SAME EVIL
AND TO MOVE TO DO IT PROMPTLY AND BY USE OF THE REQUISITE MEANS IS TO BE DISCIPLINED WHETHER WE ARE THINKING OF AN ARMY OR A MIND DISCIPLINE IS POSITIVE TO COW THE SPIRIT
THE CONNECTION OF THESE TWO PHASES OF EXPERIENCE MEASURES THE FRUITFULNESS OR VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE MERE ACTIVITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE EXPERIENCE IT IS DISPERSIVE CENTRIFUGAL
DISSIPATING EXPERIENCE AS TRYING INVOLVES CHANGE BUT CHANGE IS MEANINGLESS TRANSITION UNLESS IT IS CONSCIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH THE RETURN WAVE OF CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM IT
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND METHODS OF EDUCATION FROM ONE WHICH AIMS SIMPLY AT THE PERPETUATION OF ITS OWN CUSTOMS TO MAKE THE GENERAL IDEAS SET FORTH APPLICABLE TO OUR OWN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO COME TO CLOSER QUARTERS
THEY AFFORD CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT CHANGES IN THINGS ARE NOT ALIEN TO THE ACTIVITIES OF A SELF AND THAT THE CAREER AND WELFARE OF THE SELF ARE BOUND UP WITH THE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND THINGS INTEREST CONCERN
HOW FULL AND FREE IS THE INTERPLAY WITH OTHER FORMS OF ASSOCIATION IF WE APPLY THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO SAY A CRIMINAL BAND WE FIND THAT THE TIES WHICH CONSCIOUSLY HOLD THE MEMBERS TOGETHER ARE FEW IN NUMBER
BUT ARISTOTLE SIMPLY DESCRIBED WITHOUT CONFUSION AND WITHOUT THAT INSINCERITY ALWAYS ATTENDANT UPON MENTAL CONFUSION THE LIFE THAT WAS BEFORE HIM THAT THE ACTUAL SOCIAL SITUATION
DISPOSITION TO PERSIST AND ENDURE IN A PLANNED COURSE OF ACTION IN SPITE OF DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRARY SOLICITATIONS A MAN OF STRONG WILL IN THE POPULAR USAGE OF THE WORDS
AND OF AN AGENT OR PARTICIPANT THE FORMER IS INDIFFERENT TO WHAT IS GOING ON ONE RESULT IS JUST AS GOOD AS ANOTHER SINCE EACH IS JUST SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THE LATTER IS BOUND UP WITH WHAT IS GOING ON
TO SEPARATE PERCEPTIONS AND EVEN IDEAS FROM JUDGMENTS THE LATTER ARE THOUGHT TO COME AFTER THE FORMER IN ORDER TO COMPARE THEM IT IS ALLEGED THAT THE MIND PERCEIVES THINGS APART FROM RELATIONS
THINKING THEY ARE IDEAS TO DISPOSE OF QUESTIONS THE DISPOSAL BEING IN REALITY SIMPLY SUCH AN OBSCURING OF PERCEPTION AS PREVENTS US FROM SEEING ANY LONGER THE DIFFICULTY
IN SOME INDIVIDUALS APPETITES NATURALLY DOMINATE THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO THE LABORING AND TRADING CLASS WHICH EXPRESSES AND SUPPLIES HUMAN WANTS OTHERS REVEAL UPON EDUCATION
BUSINESS AGGREGATIONS THAT PREY UPON THE PUBLIC WHILE SERVING IT POLITICAL MACHINES HELD TOGETHER BY THE INTEREST OF PLUNDER ARE INCLUDED IF IT IS SAID THAT SUCH ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT SOCIETIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET THE IDEAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE NOTION OF SOCIETY
LEADS TO OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEM PROBABLY THE MOST DEEP SEATED ANTITHESIS WHICH HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY IS THAT BETWEEN EDUCATION IN PREPARATION FOR USEFUL LABOR
IN DISCOVERY OF THE DETAILED CONNECTIONS OF OUR ACTIVITIES AND WHAT HAPPENS IN CONSEQUENCE THE THOUGHT IMPLIED IN CUT AND TRY EXPERIENCE IS MADE EXPLICIT ITS QUANTITY INCREASES SO THAT ITS
THE MORE ADEQUATELY IT ENGAGES INTELLIGENCE SO CONSISTENTLY DOES ARISTOTLE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN MENIAL AND LIBERAL EDUCATION THAT HE PUTS WHAT ARE NOW CALLED THE FINE
TOO FREQUENTLY MIND IS SET OVER THE WORLD OF THINGS AND FACTS TO BE KNOWN IT IS REGARDED AS SOMETHING EXISTING IN ISOLATION WITH MENTAL STATES AND OPERATIONS THAT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY
BUT THE EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMATION IS NEEDED TO GIVE FULL AND EXPLICIT EFFECT TO THE CHANGES IMPLIED IN SOCIAL LIFE THE INCREASED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EMANCIPATION OF THE MASSES HAS SHOWN ITSELF IN EDUCATION
WE SHALL HAVE NO CRITERION FOR RATIONALLY DECIDING WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE WHICH SHOULD BE PROMOTED NOR HOW SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE ORDERED WE SHALL HAVE NO CONCEPTION OF THE PROPER LIMITS AND DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVITIES WHAT HE CALLED JUSTICE
TWO CONCLUSIONS IMPORTANT FOR EDUCATION FOLLOW ONE EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARILY AN ACTIVE PASSIVE AFFAIR IT IS NOT PRIMARILY COGNITIVE BUT TWO
AND EXTERNAL RESULTS IN DISCUSSING FOR EXAMPLE EDUCATION IN MUSIC HE RAISES THE QUESTION HOW FAR THE YOUNG SHOULD BE PRACTICED IN THE PLAYING OF INSTRUMENTS
THEIR ACTIVITY BECOMES FREE OR VOLUNTARY AND LOSES ITS EXTERNALLY ENFORCED AND SERVILE QUALITY EVEN THOUGH THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF BEHAVIOR REMAIN THE SAME IN WHAT IS TERMED POLITICS
ONLY BY COURTESY CAN SUCH AN EXPERIENCE BE CALLED EXPERIENCE TO LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE IS TO MAKE A BACKWARD AND FORWARD CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT WE DO TO THINGS AND WHAT WE ENJOY OR SUFFER FROM THINGS IN CONSEQUENCE
ANY MODE OF SKILL WHICH IS ACHIEVED WITH DEEPENING OF KNOWLEDGE AND PERFECTING OF JUDGMENT IS READILY PUT TO USE IN NEW SITUATIONS AND IS UNDER PERSONAL CONTROL IT WAS NOT THE BARE FACT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC UTILITY
INTELLIGENCE IS NARROWED TO THE FACTORS CONCERNED WITH TECHNICAL PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF GOODS NO DOUBT A VERY ACUTE AND INTENSE INTELLIGENCE IN THESE NARROW LINES CAN BE DEVELOPED BUT THE FAILURE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL FACTORS
THESE STATEMENTS ARE TOO FORMAL TO BE VERY INTELLIGIBLE AN ILLUSTRATION MAY CLEAR UP THEIR SIGNIFICANCE YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A CERTAIN OCCUPATION SAY WRITING WITH A TYPEWRITER IF YOU ARE AN EXPERT
THAT INTEREST AND DISCIPLINE ARE CONNECTED NOT OPPOSED
SO MUCH FOR THE MEANING OF THE TERM INTEREST NOW FOR THAT OF DISCIPLINE WHERE AN ACTIVITY TAKES TIME
THIS FACT AFFECTED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DOCTRINE OF THE RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE AND DESIRE THEORY AND PRACTICE IT WAS EMBODIED IN A POLITICAL THEORY OF A PERMANENT DIVISION OF HUMAN BEINGS
NOT LIBERATIVE OF IMAGINATION OR THINKING POWER IN THE INHERITED SITUATION THERE IS A CURIOUS INTERMINGLING IN EVEN THE SAME STUDY OF CONCESSION TO USEFULNESS
THE SEPARATION OF LIBERAL EDUCATION FROM PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION GOES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE GREEKS AND WAS FORMULATED EXPRESSLY ON THE BASIS OF A DIVISION OF CLASSES INTO THOSE WHO HAD TO LABOR FOR A LIVING
ONCE ISOLATED SO FAR AS INTENTION COULD KEEP UP A SEPARATION BUT CHANGE IN SOCIAL HABIT ITS CONTINUOUS READJUSTMENT THROUGH MEETING THE NEW SITUATIONS PRODUCED BY VARIED INTERCOURSE
IT HAS EFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM OF EDUCATION PUBLIC AND FREE IT HAS DESTROYED THE IDEA THAT LEARNING IS PROPERLY A MONOPOLY OF THE FEW WHO ARE PREDESTINED BY NATURE TO GOVERN SOCIAL AFFAIRS
WE GET NOTHING WHICH MAY BE CARRIED OVER TO FORESEE WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NEXT AND NO GAIN IN ABILITY TO ADJUST OURSELVES TO WHAT IS COMING NO ADDED CONTROL
SO THAT THEIR RESEMBLANCE OR CAUSAL CONNECTION SHALL BE BROUGHT OUT
AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A SOCIETY MIGHT CHANGE AND YET BE STABLE HIS DOCTRINE OF LIMITED POWERS AND CLASSES CAME IN NET EFFECT TO THE IDEA OF THE SUBORDINATION OF INDIVIDUALITY
INCLUDING HIS RELATIONS TO OTHERS WHO TAKE PART WHICH WILL ENLIST HIS INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN WHAT HE IS DOING EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION OFTEN DEMANDS DIVISION OF LABOR BUT IT IS REDUCED TO A MECHANICAL ROUTINE UNLESS WORKERS SEE THE TECHNICAL INTELLECTUAL
AND THAT IT PLAYS A DUE PART IN THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND IN RETURN RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM IT IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY INTERESTS CONSCIOUSLY COMMUNICATED AND SHARED AND THERE ARE VARIED AND FREE POINTS OF CONTACT WITH OTHER MODES OF ASSOCIATION
EVEN THE MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL PHASE OF TRAINED POWER APPREHENSION OF WHAT ONE IS DOING AS EXHIBITED IN CONSEQUENCES IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT INTEREST
WHAT ONE INTENDS TO WRITE THE CASE IS THE SAME THERE IS AN ACTIVITY IN PROCESS ONE IS TAKEN UP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THEME
A MECHANICAL HABIT WAS ESTABLISHED WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO READ SUBSEQUENTLY WITH INTELLIGENCE THE VOCAL ORGANS HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO GO THEIR OWN WAY AUTOMATICALLY IN ISOLATION AND MEANING CANNOT BE TIED ON AT WILL
AND TO FAIL TO NOTE HOW RESTRICTED IS OUR PERCEPTION OF THE RELATIONS WHICH CONFER SIGNIFICANCE WE GET SO THOROUGHLY USED TO A KIND OF PSEUDO IDEA A HALF PERCEPTION
OF THIS AND THAT HAPPENING HE IS IDENTIFIED FOR THE TIME AT LEAST WITH THE ISSUE HIS FATE HANGS UPON THE COURSE THINGS ARE TAKING BUT EVEN FOR AN ONLOOKER IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EVERY MOVE MADE
THE OUTCOME OF THE MIXTURE IS PERHAPS LESS SATISFACTORY THAN IF EITHER PRINCIPLE WERE ADHERED TO IN ITS PURITY
THAT IS MIDDLE CONDITIONS ACTS TO BE PERFORMED DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME APPLIANCES TO BE USED ONLY THROUGH THEM IN THE LITERAL TIME SENSE WILL THE INITIAL ACTIVITIES REACH A SATISFACTORY CONSUMMATION
AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE RIGHTLY TRAINED MINDS WILL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE END AND ORDERING PRINCIPLE OF THINGS WE SEEM TO BE CAUGHT IN A HOPELESS CIRCLE HOWEVER PLATO SUGGESTED A WAY OUT
SUCH PERSONS ARE NOT TRULY ENDS IN THEMSELVES FOR ONLY REASON CONSTITUTES A FINAL END LIKE PLANTS ANIMALS AND PHYSICAL TOOLS
AND A SURVIVAL OF TRAITS ONCE EXCLUSIVELY ATTRIBUTED TO PREPARATION FOR LEISURE THE UTILITY ELEMENT IS FOUND IN THE MOTIVES ASSIGNED FOR THE STUDY THE LIBERAL ELEMENT IN METHODS OF TEACHING
SO THAT A SUBJECT IS ILLIBERAL BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL AND CULTURAL BECAUSE IT IS USELESS IT WILL GENERALLY BE FOUND THAT INSTRUCTION WHICH IN AIMING AT UTILITARIAN RESULTS
YOUR ATTENTION IS NOT DISTRIBUTED INDIFFERENTLY AND MISCELLANEOUSLY TO ANY AND EVERY DETAIL IT IS CENTERED UPON WHATEVER HAS A BEARING UPON THE EFFECTIVE PURSUIT OF YOUR OCCUPATION YOUR LOOK IS AHEAD
EVERY PERCEPTION AND EVERY IDEA IS A SENSE OF THE BEARINGS USE AND CAUSE OF A THING WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW A CHAIR OR HAVE AN IDEA OF IT BY INVENTORYING AND ENUMERATING ITS VARIOUS ISOLATED QUALITIES
EDUCATIONALLY IT THEN FOLLOWS THAT TO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO INTEREST MEANS TO ATTACH SOME FEATURE OF SEDUCTIVENESS TO MATERIAL OTHERWISE INDIFFERENT TO SECURE ATTENTION AND EFFORT BY OFFERING A BRIBE
THESE INTERMEDIATE CONDITIONS ARE OF INTEREST PRECISELY BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING ACTIVITIES INTO THE FORESEEN AND DESIRED END DEPENDS UPON THEM TO BE MEANS FOR THE ACHIEVING OF PRESENT TENDENCIES
IF WE TURN TO GREEK SCHOOLING WE FIND THAT FROM THE EARLIEST YEARS
LEAVE OUT THE DIRECTION WHICH DEPENDS UPON FORESIGHT OF POSSIBLE FUTURE RESULTS AND THERE IS NO INTELLIGENCE IN PRESENT BEHAVIOR LET THERE BE IMAGINATIVE FORECAST BUT NO ATTENTION TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH ITS ATTAINMENT DEPENDS
ONE IS LIKE A MAN IN A PRISON CELL WATCHING THE RAIN OUT OF THE WINDOW IT IS ALL THE SAME TO HIM THE OTHER IS LIKE A MAN WHO HAS PLANNED AN OUTING FOR THE NEXT DAY WHICH CONTINUING RAIN WILL FRUSTRATE
AND WHILE IT MIGHT BE FOUND THAT SOME MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION CHIEFLY ACCOMPLISHED ONE RESULT AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER THE OTHER IT WOULD BE EVIDENT THAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO SECURE AS MUCH OVERLAPPING
IF IT WILL ONLY GIVE ATTENTION AND THAT THIS ATTENTION MAY BE GIVEN AT WILL IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SITUATION HENCE THE DELUGE OF HALF OBSERVATIONS OF VERBAL IDEAS AND UNASSIMILATED KNOWLEDGE
WE FAIL TO PREPARE THE MINDS OF WORKERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY MORE FUNDAMENTAL IS THE FACT THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WORKERS HAVE NO INSIGHT INTO THE SOCIAL AIMS OF THEIR PURSUITS AND NO DIRECT PERSONAL INTEREST IN THEM
THE MOTIVE POPULARLY ASSIGNED FOR MAKING THE STUDIES OF THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS CONSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY OF READING SPELLING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC IS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ABILITY TO READ WRITE
AND THAT IT IS THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATION TO DISCOVER THESE APTITUDES AND PROGRESSIVELY TO TRAIN THEM FOR SOCIAL USE MUCH WHICH HAS BEEN SAID SO FAR IS BORROWED FROM WHAT PLATO FIRST CONSCIOUSLY TAUGHT THE WORLD
AND IN JUST THE DEGREE IN WHICH MENTAL ACTIVITY IS SEPARATED FROM ACTIVE CONCERN WITH THE WORLD FROM DOING SOMETHING AND CONNECTING THE DOING WITH WHAT IS UNDERGONE WORDS SYMBOLS COME TO TAKE THE PLACE OF IDEAS
IN SCHOOLS THOSE UNDER INSTRUCTION ARE TOO CUSTOMARILY LOOKED UPON AS ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AS THEORETICAL SPECTATORS MINDS WHICH APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE BY DIRECT ENERGY OF INTELLECT
SUBSEQUENT CHAPTERS WILL BE DEVOTED TO MAKING EXPLICIT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAS IN EDUCATION IN THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS CHAPTER WE SHALL CONSIDER THE EDUCATIONAL THEORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN EVOLVED IN THREE EPOCHS
A MATTER OF HABIT OR ELSE IT IS BLIND IN NEITHER CASE IS IT INTELLIGENT TO BE VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT IS INTENDED AND CARELESS IN OBSERVATION OF CONDITIONS OF ITS REALIZATION
PERSISTENCE AND ENERGY IN USE OF MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE END THE REALLY EXECUTIVE MAN IS A MAN WHO PONDERS HIS ENDS WHO MAKES HIS IDEAS OF THE RESULTS OF HIS ACTIONS AS CLEAR AND FULL AS POSSIBLE
WITH THE NATURE OF PRESENT SOCIAL LIFE ONE THE IMPLICATIONS OF HUMAN ASSOCIATION SOCIETY IS ONE WORD BUT MANY THINGS MEN ASSOCIATE TOGETHER IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS AND FOR ALL KINDS OF PURPOSES
AND YET TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE EDUCATION WOULD SEE TO IT THAT WE AVOIDED THE EVIL RESULTS WHICH FLOW FROM THEIR BEING ALLOWED TO FLOURISH IN OBSCURE
ALL MERCENARY EMPLOYMENTS AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH DEGRADE THE CONDITION OF THE BODY ARE MECHANICAL
THEY ALSO UNFIT FOR THE LATTER MEANS ARE MENIAL THE SERVICEABLE IS SERVILE THE TRUE LIFE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE DEGREE IN WHICH THE PHYSICAL NECESSITIES
INSTEAD OF IN A POSITIVE ONE OF CONSTRUCTIVE PLANNING AND EXECUTION THEY ARE THUS EDUCATED NOT INTO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SIGNIFICANT AND GRACEFUL USE OF BODILY POWERS
REPRESENT AND DEPEND UPON APPLIED MATHEMATICS PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY THE AREA OF THE HUMAN WORLD INFLUENCED BY ECONOMIC PRODUCTION AND INFLUENCING CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN SO INDEFINITELY WIDENED THAT GEOGRAPHICAL
LET US APPLY THE FIRST ELEMENT IN THIS CRITERION TO A DESPOTICALLY GOVERNED STATE IT IS NOT TRUE THERE IS NO COMMON INTEREST IN SUCH AN ORGANIZATION BETWEEN GOVERNED AND GOVERNORS
HAS GREATLY CHANGED SINCE HIS DAY THERE IS NO NEED TO SAY BUT IN SPITE OF THESE CHANGES IN SPITE OF THE ABOLITION OF LEGAL SERFDOM AND THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY WITH THE EXTENSION OF SCIENCE AND OF GENERAL EDUCATION
FROM REASON MOREOVER PROCEEDS THE PROPER CONTROL OF THE LOWER ELEMENTS OF HUMAN NATURE THE APPETITES AND THE ACTIVE MOTOR IMPULSES IN THEMSELVES GREEDY INSUBORDINATE
WHILE THE DISTINCTION IS OFTEN THOUGHT TO BE INTRINSIC AND ABSOLUTE IT IS REALLY HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL IT ORIGINATED SO FAR AS CONSCIOUS FORMULATION IS CONCERNED IN GREECE
THEY INVOLVE CONNECTION WITH THE ANIMALS THAT DRAW IT THE THINGS THAT ARE CARRIED ON IT AND SO ON JUDGMENT IS EMPLOYED IN THE PERCEPTION OTHERWISE THE PERCEPTION IS MERE SENSORY EXCITATION
SHARING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS AFFAIRS AND WINNING PERSONAL HONOR AND DISTINCTION LIVES A LIFE ACCOMPANIED BY REASON BUT THE THINKER THE MAN WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF TO SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY
YET THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THE THEORY WAS PROPOUNDED WAS SO UNDEMOCRATIC THAT PLATO COULD NOT WORK OUT A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM WHOSE TERMS HE CLEARLY SAW
ALL OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE A PHASE OF CUT AND TRY IN THEM WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL THE METHOD OF TRIAL AND ERROR WE SIMPLY DO SOMETHING AND WHEN IT FAILS WE DO SOMETHING ELSE
A PURELY INTELLECTUAL LIFE HOWEVER ONE CARRIES ON BY HIMSELF IN HIMSELF SUCH ASSISTANCE AS HE MAY DERIVE FROM OTHERS IS ACCIDENTAL RATHER THAN INTRINSIC
AND ARE THEN TAUGHT WITH CHIEF EMPHASIS UPON FORMING TECHNICAL MODES OF SKILL IF WE HAD LESS COMPROMISE AND RESULTING CONFUSION IF WE ANALYZED MORE CAREFULLY THE RESPECTIVE MEANINGS OF CULTURE AND UTILITY
DOES NOT OPERATE IN THE WAY IT WAS EXPECTED TO BUT IF WE KNOW IN DETAIL UPON WHAT THE RESULT DEPENDS WE CAN LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS ARE THERE THE METHOD EXTENDS OUR PRACTICAL CONTROL FOR IF SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ARE MISSING
SPRING FROM THE FACT THAT CONFLICT OF PEOPLES AT LEAST ENFORCES INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THEM AND THUS ACCIDENTALLY ENABLES THEM TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THEREBY TO EXPAND THEIR HORIZONS TRAVEL ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TENDENCIES
BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE IDEAL CANNOT SIMPLY REPEAT THE TRAITS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY FOUND THE PROBLEM IS TO EXTRACT THE DESIRABLE TRAITS OF FORMS OF COMMUNITY LIFE WHICH ACTUALLY EXIST
THUS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT IN INTENT PLATO SUBORDINATED THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE SOCIAL WHOLE BUT IT IS TRUE THAT LACKING THE PERCEPTION OF THE UNIQUENESS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL HIS INCOMMENSURABILITY WITH OTHERS
BUT WHEN WE CONFINE THE EDUCATION OF THOSE WHO WORK WITH THEIR HANDS TO A FEW YEARS OF SCHOOLING DEVOTED FOR THE MOST PART TO ACQUIRING THE USE OF RUDIMENTARY SYMBOLS AT THE EXPENSE OF TRAINING IN SCIENCE LITERATURE AND HISTORY
WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH PRESENT POWERS THE FUNCTION OF THIS MATERIAL IN ENGAGING ACTIVITY AND CARRYING IT ON CONSISTENTLY AND CONTINUOUSLY IS ITS INTEREST IF THE MATERIAL OPERATES IN THIS WAY THERE IS NO CALL EITHER TO HUNT FOR DEVICES WHICH WILL MAKE IT INTERESTING
WHERE MANY MEANS AND OBSTACLES LIE BETWEEN ITS INITIATION AND COMPLETION DELIBERATION AND PERSISTENCE ARE REQUIRED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT A VERY LARGE PART OF THE EVERYDAY MEANING OF WILL IS PRECISELY THE DELIBERATE OR CONSCIOUS
THE ORDER AND UNITY OF THE WHOLE WOULD BE MAINTAINED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN ANY SCHEME OF PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHT A MORE ADEQUATE RECOGNITION ON ONE HAND OF THE EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ON THE OTHER
AND HENCE IN THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY ONLY IN A COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER IS THE FUNCTION OF REASON CAPABLE OF OPERATING AS A LAW OF LIFE IN THE MASS OF PEOPLE VEGETATIVE
IN HAVING AN INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCE BUT AS EXTERNAL INLETS AND OUTLETS OF MIND BEFORE THE CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL HE LEARNS WITH HIS HAND EYE AND EAR
ONE WHO RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEREST WILL NOT ASSUME THAT ALL MINDS WORK IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE THE SAME TEACHER AND TEXTBOOK ATTITUDES AND METHODS OF APPROACH AND RESPONSE VARY WITH THE SPECIFIC APPEAL THE SAME MATERIAL MAKES
GIVEN TO THOSE IN CONTROL OF INDUSTRY THOSE WHO SUPPLY ITS AIMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF ALL ROUND AND WELL BALANCED SOCIAL INTEREST THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT STIMULUS FOR ATTENTION TO THE HUMAN FACTORS AND RELATIONSHIPS IN INDUSTRY
THE FIRST SIGNIFIES NOT ONLY MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE VARIED POINTS OF SHARED COMMON INTEREST BUT GREATER RELIANCE UPON THE RECOGNITION OF MUTUAL INTERESTS AS A FACTOR IN SOCIAL CONTROL THE SECOND MEANS NOT ONLY FREER INTERACTION BETWEEN SOCIAL GROUPS
AND WHAT HAPPENS IN CONSEQUENCE NO EXPERIENCE HAVING A MEANING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOME ELEMENT OF THOUGHT BUT WE MAY CONTRAST TWO TYPES OF EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF REFLECTION FOUND IN THEM
A WAGON IS NOT PERCEIVED WHEN ALL ITS PARTS ARE SUMMED UP IT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC CONNECTION OF THE PARTS WHICH MAKES IT A WAGON AND THESE CONNECTIONS ARE NOT THOSE OF MERE PHYSICAL JUXTAPOSITION
THE RESULTS ACTUALLY ACHIEVED ARE NOT THE ENDS OF THEIR ACTIONS BUT ONLY OF THEIR EMPLOYERS THEY DO WHAT THEY DO NOT FREELY AND INTELLIGENTLY BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE WAGE EARNED
AND IT REQUIRES WORK TO SUPPLY THE RESOURCES OF LIFE EVEN IF WE INSIST THAT THE INTERESTS CONNECTED WITH GETTING A LIVING ARE ONLY MATERIAL AND HENCE INTRINSICALLY LOWER THAN THOSE CONNECTED WITH ENJOYMENT OF TIME RELEASED FROM LABOR
AND EDUCATION FOR A LIFE OF LEISURE THE BARE TERMS USEFUL LABOR AND LEISURE CONFIRM THE STATEMENT ALREADY MADE THAT THE SEGREGATION AND CONFLICT OF VALUES ARE NOT SELF INCLOSED
FROM WHICH MEANING RESULTS THE BOY FLYING A KITE HAS TO KEEP HIS EYE ON THE KITE AND HAS TO NOTE THE VARIOUS PRESSURES OF THE STRING ON HIS HAND HIS SENSES ARE AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
NOR CARRIED ON BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL APPRECIATION OF THEIR MEANING SO FAR AS FARMING AND THE TRADES WERE RULE OF THUMB OCCUPATIONS AND SO FAR AS THEY WERE ENGAGED IN
BUT CONDITIONS WHICH HE COULD NOT INTELLECTUALLY CONTROL LED HIM TO RESTRICT THESE IDEAS IN THEIR APPLICATION HE NEVER GOT ANY CONCEPTION OF THE INDEFINITE PLURALITY OF ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY CHARACTERIZE AN INDIVIDUAL AND A SOCIAL GROUP
THERE ARE NUMEROUS MINOR GROUPS NOT ONLY POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS BUT INDUSTRIAL SCIENTIFIC RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS THERE ARE POLITICAL PARTIES WITH DIFFERING AIMS SOCIAL SETS CLIQUES GANGS CORPORATIONS PARTNERSHIPS
ARE EMPHASIZED BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACTS WHICH THE TERM DENOTES INSTEAD OF CONFINING OUR ATTENTION TO ITS INTRINSIC CONNOTATION WE FIND NOT UNITY BUT A PLURALITY OF SOCIETIES GOOD AND BAD MEN BANDED TOGETHER IN A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY
THE BASE OR MECHANICAL AND THE LIBERAL OR INTELLECTUAL SOME PERSONS ARE TRAINED BY SUITABLE PRACTICAL EXERCISES FOR CAPACITY IN DOING THINGS
ONLY IF IT HELPS RENDER THE OLD IDEA OBSOLETE IN FACT IN THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF LIFE AND EDUCATION ARISTOTLE WAS PERMANENTLY RIGHT IN ASSUMING THE INFERIORITY AND SUBORDINATION OF MERE SKILL
AND STRIVEN FOR THEY TAKE FOR GRANTED THE PERSONAL ATTITUDE OF SOLICITUDE AND ATTENTIVE EAGERNESS SUCH WORDS AS INTEREST AFFECTION CONCERN MOTIVATION
THE POINT WHERE IT INFLUENCES HIM IN SOME LEGAL TRANSACTIONS A MAN HAS TO PROVE INTEREST IN ORDER TO HAVE A STANDING AT COURT HE HAS TO SHOW THAT SOME PROPOSED STEP CONCERNS HIS AFFAIRS
FOR ABILITY TO USE THE MECHANICAL TOOLS INVOLVED IN TURNING OUT PHYSICAL COMMODITIES AND RENDERING PERSONAL SERVICE THIS TRAINING IS A MERE MATTER OF HABITUATION AND TECHNICAL SKILL IT OPERATES THROUGH REPETITION
BECAUSE NOT FREELY PARTICIPATED IN NEVERTHELESS THERE IS ALREADY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN EDUCATION WHICH KEEPING IN MIND THE LARGER FEATURES OF WORK
OR BY PRESENTATION OF INDUCEMENTS TO AN ACTION THAT IS DIRECTLY MORE AGREEABLE A PERSON WHO IS TRAINED TO CONSIDER HIS ACTIONS TO UNDERTAKE THEM DELIBERATELY IS IN SO FAR FORTH DISCIPLINED
THE RESULT IS A SYSTEM IN WHICH BOTH CULTURAL AND UTILITARIAN SUBJECTS EXIST IN AN INORGANIC COMPOSITE WHERE THE FORMER ARE NOT BY DOMINANT PURPOSE SOCIALLY SERVICEABLE AND THE LATTER
AS TO LEAVE IT IF WE EXCEPT HEYWARD AND DAVID THE TRAIL OF BUT A SINGLE MAN THE PARTY WAS HOWEVER SCARCELY UNCOVERED BEFORE A VOLLEY FROM A DOZEN RIFLES WAS HEARD IN THEIR REAR AND A DELAWARE LEAPING HIGH IN TO THE AIR LIKE A WOUNDED DEER FELL AT HIS WHOLE LENGTH DEAD
SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR AND IS ENTITLED THE PSALMS HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS FAITHFULLY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH METRE FOR THE USE EDIFICATION AND COMFORT OF THE SAINTS
STAY DOG OF THE WYANDOTS EXCLAIMED UNCAS SHAKING HIS BRIGHT TOMAHAWK AT MAGUA A DELAWARE GIRL CALLS STAY I WILL GO NO FURTHER
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN THE SUCCESS OF THE STRUGGLE WAS AGAIN BECOMING DOUBTFUL THE CRACK OF A RIFLE WAS HEARD BEHIND THE HURONS AND A BULLET CAME WHIZZING FROM AMONG SOME BEAVER LODGES
THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
HE IS HAPPY WHO KNOWS THAT THE EVIL OF HIS RACE DIES WITH HIMSELF I HAVE DONE THE SPEAKER WHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE RECREANT YOUNG INDIAN LOOKED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM
THOUGH THE WORST ENEMY I HAVE ON EARTH AND HE IS AN IROQUOIS DAREN'T DENY THAT I AM GENUINE WHITE THE SCOUT REPLIED SURVEYING WITH SECRET SATISFACTION THE FADED COLOR OF HIS BONY AND SINEWY HAND
THE HURON WAS CONTENT WITH THE ASSURANCE AND RESUMING HIS PIPE HE AWAITED THE PROPER MOMENT TO MOVE THE IMPATIENT HEYWARD INWARDLY EXECRATING THE COLD CUSTOMS OF THE SAVAGES
TOGETHER E E N IN UNITY FOR BRETHREN SO TO DWELL IT'S LIKE THE CHOICE OINTMENT FROM THE HEAD TO THE BEARD DID GO DOWN AARON'S HEAD THAT DOWNWARD WENT HIS GARMENT'S SKIRTS UNTO
AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLACE IN WILD CONFUSION A DOZEN BLAZING PILES NOW SHED THEIR LURID BRIGHTNESS ON THE PLACE WHICH RESEMBLED SOME UNHALLOWED AND SUPERNATURAL ARENA
WHO CONTINUED HIS STEADY PACE IN UNDISTURBED GRAVITY THE YOUNG MAN SMILED TO HIMSELF FOR HE BELIEVED HE HAD MISTAKEN SOME SHINING BERRY OF THE WOODS FOR THE GLISTENING EYEBALLS OF A PROWLING SAVAGE AND HE RODE FORWARD CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
GRAVELY AWAITING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THOSE WHO HAD UNEXPECTEDLY COME AMONG THEM DAVID IN SOME MEASURE FAMILIARIZED TO THE SCENE LED THE WAY WITH A STEADINESS THAT NO SLIGHT OBSTACLE WAS LIKELY TO DISCONCERT INTO THIS VERY BUILDING
SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN CLOTHES HIS IDEAS IN A DRESS WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AFRICAN AND IS ORIENTAL IN ITSELF HIS LANGUAGE
WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
BUT UNCAS WHO HAD VAINLY SOUGHT HIM IN THE MELEE BOUNDED FORWARD IN PURSUIT HAWKEYE HEYWARD AND DAVID STILL PRESSING ON HIS FOOTSTEPS
BEFORE HIS VICTIM STILL KEEPING HIS GAZE RIVETED ON HIS ENEMY WITH A LOOK OF INEXTINGUISHABLE SCORN FELL DEAD AT HIS FEET MERCY MERCY HURON CRIED HEYWARD FROM ABOVE IN TONES NEARLY CHOKED BY HORROR
THE BROOK WAS IRREGULAR IN ITS WIDTH SOMETIMES SHOOTING THROUGH NARROW FISSURES IN THE ROCKS AND AT OTHERS SPREADING OVER ACRES OF BOTTOM LAND FORMING LITTLE AREAS THAT MIGHT BE TERMED PONDS
WHICH MAY POSSIBLY BE THOUGHT CORROBORATIVE OF THE MOSAIC ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION THE WHITES HAVE ASSISTED GREATLY IN RENDERING THE TRADITIONS OF THE ABORIGINES MORE OBSCURE BY THEIR OWN MANNER OF CORRUPTING NAMES
PIQUED AT HER REMARK BUT I KNOW THAT YOUR SAFETY AND THAT OF CORA IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN COULD BE ANY ORCHESTRA OF HANDEL'S MUSIC HE PAUSED AND TURNED HIS HEAD QUICKLY TOWARD A THICKET AND THEN BENT HIS EYES SUSPICIOUSLY ON THEIR GUIDE
HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
WHEN AN INDIAN CHIEF COMES AMONG HIS WHITE FATHERS RETURNED DUNCAN WITH GREAT STEADINESS
BUT HIS INGENUITY AVAILED HIM LITTLE AGAINST THE COLD ARTIFICES OF THE PEOPLE HE HAD ENCOUNTERED THE CHIEFS IN FRONT SCARCE CAST A GLANCE AT HIS PERSON KEEPING THEIR EYES ON THE GROUND WITH AN AIR THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR RESPECT
ACROSS THE TRACT OF WILDERNESS WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE DELAWARES AND THE VILLAGE OF THEIR ENEMIES IT SEEMED AS IF THE FOOT OF MAN HAD NEVER TRODDEN SO BREATHING AND DEEP WAS THE SILENCE IN WHICH IT LAY BUT HAWKEYE WHOSE DUTY LED HIM FOREMOST IN THE ADVENTURE
HE SEES THE DEAD YENGEESE BUT NO HURON WHAT CAN THIS MEAN A GREAT CHIEF LIKE HIM HAS MORE THOUGHTS THAN TONGUES
FOR THOUGH THE TIMES MAY CALL FOR SOME SLIGHT CHANGES YET DOES THIS VERSION WHICH WE USE IN THE COLONIES OF NEW ENGLAND SO MUCH EXCEED ALL OTHER VERSIONS THAT BY ITS RICHNESS ITS EXACTNESS AND ITS SPIRITUAL SIMPLICITY IT APPROACHETH AS NEAR
WITHIN THE POWERFUL LIGHT OF A GLARING TORCH WHILE THEIR JUNIORS AND INFERIORS WERE ARRANGED IN THE BACKGROUND PRESENTING A DARK OUTLINE OF SWARTHY AND MARKED VISAGES IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE LODGE
WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
THE CANADIAN SAVAGES SHOULD BE LURKING SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF THEIR ARMY FOR MANY MINUTES THE INTRICACY OF THE ROUTE ADMITTED OF NO FURTHER DIALOGUE AFTER WHICH THEY EMERGED FROM THE BROAD BORDER OF UNDERBRUSH WHICH GREW ALONG THE LINE OF THE HIGHWAY
LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
YOUR MEN HAVE REMINDED ME OF THE CHILDREN OF JACOB GOING OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST THE SHECHEMITES FOR WICKEDLY ASPIRING TO WEDLOCK WITH A WOMAN OF A RACE THAT WAS FAVORED OF THE LORD NOW I HAVE JOURNEYED FAR AND SOJOURNED MUCH IN GOOD AND EVIL WITH THE MAIDEN YE SEEK
BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
AND EVEN THE DARK THOUGHTFUL EYE OF CORA
THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
THEN TURNING WITH A PROMPT AND DECIDED AIR HE CALLED ALOUD TO HIS INDIANS IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE HIS WORDS WERE ANSWERED BY A SHOUT AND AT A GIVEN SIGNAL EACH WARRIOR MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AROUND HIS PARTICULAR TREE
EVERY DISAGREEABLE SENSATION WAS QUIETED IN INWARD CONGRATULATION FOR THE OPPORTUNE RELIEF AND INSIGNIFICANCE IT CONFERRED ON HIMSELF WHEN AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE LODGES THE NEWLY ARRIVED WARRIORS HALTED
COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
THE OTHER QUICKLY RECOVERED FROM THE ALARM WHICH INDUCED THE EXCLAMATION AND LAUGHING AT HER OWN WEAKNESS SHE INQUIRED OF THE YOUTH WHO RODE BY HER SIDE ARE SUCH SPECTERS FREQUENT IN THE WOODS HEYWARD OR IS THIS SIGHT
SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
DO THE CUNNING MEN OF THE CANADAS PAINT THEIR SKINS THE HURON COLDLY CONTINUED WE HAVE HEARD THEM BOAST THAT THEIR FACES WERE PALE
A BURST OF SAVAGE LAUGHTER SUCCEEDED THIS ATTACK DURING WHICH THE SOFT AND MUSICAL MERRIMENT OF THE YOUNGER FEMALES STRANGELY CHIMED WITH THE CRACKED VOICE OF THEIR OLDER AND MORE MALIGNANT COMPANION BUT THE STRANGER WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL THEIR EFFORTS
THE EYE COULD RANGE IN EVERY DIRECTION THROUGH THE LONG AND SHADOWED VISTAS OF THE TREES BUT NOWHERE WAS ANY OBJECT TO BE SEEN THAT DID NOT PROPERLY BELONG TO THE PEACEFUL AND SLUMBERING SCENERY HERE AND THERE A BIRD WAS HEARD FLUTTERING AMONG THE BRANCHES OF THE BEECHES
THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
NOT SO THEY WHO WEAR THE PETTICOATS OF SQUAWS ON THEIR OWN RIVER ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN PASSING THE TRIBE DID MY YOUNG MEN TAKE HIS SCALP
A SINGLE BOUND WOULD CARRY HIM TO THE BROW OF THE PRECIPICE AND ASSURE HIS SAFETY
AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
AND GENTLY PUSHED HER ASIDE REED THAT BENDS HE SAID ADDRESSING THE YOUNG CULPRIT BY NAME AND IN HIS PROPER LANGUAGE THOUGH THE GREAT SPIRIT HAS MADE YOU PLEASANT TO THE EYES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN BORN
THOUGH IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE GOVERNED BY VERY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS WHILE ONE STOOD ERECT AND FIRM PREPARED TO MEET HIS FATE LIKE A HERO THE OTHER BOWED HIS HEAD AS IF PALSIED BY TERROR OR STRICKEN WITH SHAME
YOU KNOW ME MOHICAN NOT A HURON OF THEM ALL SHALL CROSS THE SWELL INTO YOUR REAR WITHOUT THE NOTICE OF KILLDEER THE INDIAN CHIEF PAUSED ANOTHER MOMENT TO CONSIDER THE SIGNS OF THE CONTEST WHICH WAS NOW ROLLING RAPIDLY UP THE ASCENT
DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
AND I AM WILLING TO OWN THAT MY PEOPLE HAVE MANY WAYS OF WHICH AS AN HONEST MAN I CAN'T APPROVE IT IS ONE OF THEIR CUSTOMS TO WRITE IN BOOKS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND SEEN INSTEAD OF TELLING THEM IN THEIR VILLAGES
THEY WHO COMPOSED THE OUTER CIRCLE OF FACES WERE ON TIPTOE TO GAZE AND EVEN THE CULPRIT FOR AN INSTANT FORGOT HIS SHAME IN A DEEPER EMOTION AND EXPOSED HIS ABJECT FEATURES IN ORDER TO CAST AN ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED GLANCE AT THE DARK ASSEMBLAGE OF CHIEFS
THE RED HURONS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND ASK IF ANY ARE SICK ANOTHER SILENCE SUCCEEDED THIS ANNUNCIATION OF THE CHARACTER DUNCAN HAD ASSUMED EVERY EYE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY BENT ON HIS PERSON
HIS HEAD WAS IMMOVABLE NOR DID HE BETRAY THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ANY WERE PRESENT EXCEPT WHEN HIS HAUGHTY EYE ROLLED TOWARD THE DUSKY FORMS OF THE WARRIORS WHO STALKED IN THE BACKGROUND SILENT AND SULLEN OBSERVERS OF THE SCENE
SAID THE LADY SHUDDERING PARTLY IN ASSUMED YET MORE IN REAL TERROR YOU KNOW HIM DUNCAN
HEYWARD THREW HIMSELF AMONG THE COMBATANTS AND IMITATING THE NECESSARY CAUTION OF HIS COMPANIONS HE MADE QUICK DISCHARGES WITH HIS OWN RIFLE THE CONTEST NOW GREW WARM AND STATIONARY FEW WERE INJURED AS BOTH PARTIES KEPT THEIR BODIES AS MUCH PROTECTED AS POSSIBLE BY THE TREES
AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
ONCE MORE HE STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF AND LIFTED THE KEEN WEAPON AGAIN BUT JUST THEN A PIERCING CRY WAS HEARD ABOVE THEM AND UNCAS APPEARED LEAPING FRANTICALLY FROM A FEARFUL HEIGHT UPON THE LEDGE MAGUA RECOILED A STEP AND ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS PROFITING BY THE CHANCE
THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
THAT THIS IS A BAND OF RANGERS CHOSEN FOR THE MOST DESPERATE SERVICE AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF ONE WHO THOUGH ANOTHER MIGHT SAY IT WITH A BETTER FACE WILL NOT BE APT TO LEAVE THEM IDLE IT MAY NOT BE FIVE IT CANNOT BE THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE WE TREAD ON THE BODY OF A HURON LIVING OR DEAD
YOU HAVE THE STORY TOLD BY YOUR FATHERS RETURNED THE OTHER COLDLY WAVING HIS HAND WHAT SAY YOUR OLD MEN
HE LOOKS TO SEE THAT NO ENEMIES ARE ON HIS TRAIL THE CANOE OF A DEAD WARRIOR WILL NOT FLOAT ON THE HORICAN RETURNED THE SAVAGE GLOOMILY HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THE DELAWARES
THE UTMOST THAT THE SCOUT COULD EFFECT WAS TO KEEP THE MUZZLE OF HIS RIFLE A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF HIS FRIEND TO WHOM HOWEVER IT ANSWERED EVERY PURPOSE OF A CHARMED SHIELD ONCE MAGUA APPEARED DISPOSED TO MAKE ANOTHER AND A FINAL EFFORT TO REVENGE HIS LOSSES BUT ABANDONING HIS INTENTION AS SOON AS DEMONSTRATED
AND I WAS FAR GONE IN A LEARNED INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF SUCH AN UNFITNESS BETWEEN SOUND AND SENSE WHEN YOU BROKE THE CHARM OF MY MUSINGS BY THAT BASS OF YOURS DUNCAN I KNOW NOT WHAT YOU CALL MY BASS SAID HEYWARD
HE FOUND IT EVERYWHERE MET BY DARK QUICK AND ROLLING EYEBALLS GATHERING NO ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THIS STARTLING PRESAGE OF THE NATURE OF THE SCRUTINY HE WAS LIKELY TO UNDERGO FROM THE MORE MATURE JUDGMENTS OF THE MEN
NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
BUT THEY PROVED TO BE THOSE OF A STRANGER AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE INEXPLICABLE OF ONE WHO BORE ALL THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF A HURON WARRIOR INSTEAD OF MINGLING WITH HIS TRIBE HOWEVER HE SAT APART A SOLITARY BEING IN A MULTITUDE
TIS CORA EXCLAIMED HEYWARD IN A VOICE IN WHICH HORROR AND DELIGHT WERE WILDLY MINGLED CORA CORA ECHOED UNCAS BOUNDING FORWARD LIKE A DEER TIS THE MAIDEN SHOUTED THE SCOUT COURAGE LADY WE COME WE COME
MODEST AND COMMONLY CHASTE THESE ARE QUALITIES IT IS TRUE WHICH DO NOT DISTINGUISH ALL ALIKE BUT THEY ARE SO FAR THE PREDOMINATING TRAITS OF THESE REMARKABLE PEOPLE
AND SEATED HIMSELF IN SILENCE SO SOON AS THEIR VISITOR HAD PASSED THE OBSERVANT WARRIORS FELL BACK FROM THE ENTRANCE AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM THEY SEEMED PATIENTLY TO AWAIT THE MOMENT WHEN IT MIGHT COMPORT WITH THE DIGNITY OF THE STRANGER TO SPEAK
ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
AND APPARENTLY AS UNCONCERNED AS IF HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE RESULT
SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
BUT BOYS LITTLE ABLE TO WIELD THE INSTRUMENTS TORE THE TOMAHAWKS FROM THE BELTS OF THEIR FATHERS AND STOLE INTO THE RANKS APT IMITATORS OF THE SAVAGE TRAITS EXHIBITED BY THEIR PARENTS
COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
AND SHIFT THE SCENE A FEW MILES TO THE WESTWARD OF THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE LAST SEEN THEM ON THAT DAY TWO MEN WERE LINGERING ON THE BANKS OF A SMALL BUT RAPID STREAM WITHIN AN HOUR'S JOURNEY OF THE ENCAMPMENT OF WEBB
AND SEEMINGLY CONVERSED MUCH TOGETHER YET ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE INTERPRETER EACH WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID
THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
HE ALSO BORE A KNIFE IN A GIRDLE OF WAMPUM LIKE THAT WHICH CONFINED THE SCANTY GARMENTS OF THE INDIAN BUT NO TOMAHAWK HIS MOCCASINS WERE ORNAMENTED AFTER THE GAY FASHION OF THE NATIVES
I THANK YOU FRIEND RETURNED DAVID SUPPLYING HIMSELF LIKE HIS ROYAL NAMESAKE FROM AMONG THE PEBBLES OF THE BROOK THOUGH NOT GIVEN TO THE DESIRE TO KILL HAD YOU SENT ME AWAY MY SPIRIT WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLED
MY BROTHERS HAVE GIVEN ME PAINT AND I WEAR IT A LOW MURMUR OF APPLAUSE ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPLIMENT OF THE TRIBE WAS FAVORABLY RECEIVED THE ELDERLY CHIEF MADE A GESTURE OF COMMENDATION
ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
THE SILENCE WAS FINALLY BROKEN BY THE AGED WARRIOR SO OFTEN NAMED HE AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND MOVING PAST THE IMMOVABLE FORM OF UNCAS PLACED HIMSELF IN A DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE BEFORE THE OFFENDER AT THAT MOMENT
POPE'S ILIAD A SINGLE MOMENT SERVED TO CONVINCE THE YOUTH THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN A HAND WAS LAID WITH A POWERFUL PRESSURE ON HIS ARM AND THE LOW VOICE OF UNCAS MUTTERED IN HIS EAR THE HURONS ARE DOGS
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BUT PLAGUES SHALL SPREAD AND FUNERAL FIRES INCREASE TILL THE GREAT KING WITHOUT A RANSOM PAID TO HER OWN CHRYSA SEND THE BLACK EYED MAID POPE
IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
CRIED THE AMUSED ALICE AND I TAKE HIM UNDER MY OWN ESPECIAL PROTECTION NAY THROW ASIDE THAT FROWN HEYWARD AND IN PITY TO MY LONGING EARS SUFFER HIM TO JOURNEY IN OUR TRAIN BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A LOW AND HURRIED VOICE
IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL EDIFICE OF THE VILLAGE THOUGH ROUGHLY CONSTRUCTED OF THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF TREES BEING THE LODGE IN WHICH THE TRIBE HELD ITS COUNCILS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS DURING THEIR TEMPORARY RESIDENCE ON THE BORDERS OF THE ENGLISH PROVINCE
HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
THE IMAGERY OF THE INDIAN BOTH IN HIS POETRY
AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
HEYWARD AND THE SCOUT STILL PRESSED ON HIS REAR ACTUATED THOUGH POSSIBLY IN A LESS DEGREE BY A COMMON FEELING BUT THEIR WAY WAS BECOMING INTRICATE IN THOSE DARK AND GLOOMY PASSAGES AND THE GLIMPSES OF THE RETIRING WARRIORS LESS DISTINCT AND FREQUENT AND FOR A MOMENT THE TRACE WAS BELIEVED TO BE LOST
ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
LAY CARELESSLY ACROSS HIS BARE AND SINEWY KNEE
THE SURROUNDING ROCKS THEMSELVES WERE NOT STEADIER THAN THE PIECE BECAME FOR THE SINGLE INSTANT THAT IT POURED OUT ITS CONTENTS
AND BENDING A CAUTIOUS GLANCE TOWARD HIS COMPANION HE CONTINUED IN A MANNER THAT WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN INTERROGATION AND ASSERTION
CASTING A GLANCE AT THE DISTANT CORA
BUT HIS EXPERIENCE QUICKLY ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER OF SO USELESS AN EXPERIMENT THEN HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND WITH PAINFUL UNCERTAINTY FOR THE SOUNDS OF HOSTILITY IN THE QUARTER WHERE UNCAS WAS LEFT
HIS EQUESTRIAN GRACES WERE STILL MORE LIKELY TO ATTRACT ATTENTION NOTWITHSTANDING A CONSTANT APPLICATION OF HIS ONE ARMED HEEL TO THE FLANKS OF THE MARE THE MOST CONFIRMED GAIT THAT HE COULD ESTABLISH WAS A CANTERBURY GALLOP WITH THE HIND LEGS
HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
ANIMATING HIS FOLLOWERS BY HIS VOICE AND HIS OWN EXAMPLE HAWKEYE THEN GAVE THE WORD TO BEAR DOWN UPON THEIR FOES
IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHILE HIS OWN SURPRISE HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED AND HAD CONSEQUENTLY FAILED THE ENEMY IN THEIR TURN HAVING BEEN DECEIVED IN ITS OBJECT AND IN HIS NUMBERS HAD LEFT TOO SMALL A FORCE TO RESIST THE IMPETUOUS ONSET OF THE YOUNG MOHICAN
SUDDENLY THE MULTITUDE ROLLED BACKWARD AND APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE HE HIMSELF STOOD THE HEAVY BODY IN THE REAR PRESSED UPON THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT AND BORE THEM TO THE EARTH THE STRANGER REAPPEARED IN THE CONFUSION
UNDER THE PRETENSE OF EXPOUNDING THE MATHEMATICS
BUT EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE APPEARED STRUNG AND INDURATED BY UNREMITTED EXPOSURE AND TOIL HE WORE A HUNTING SHIRT OF FOREST GREEN FRINGED WITH FADED YELLOW AND A SUMMER CAP OF SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN SHORN OF THEIR FUR
AND SHADOWING ITS DARK CURRENT WITH A DEEPER HUE THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE BEGINNING TO GROW LESS FIERCE AND THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS LESSENED AS THE COOLER VAPORS OF THE SPRINGS AND FOUNTAINS ROSE ABOVE THEIR LEAFY BEDS
AND RESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE STILL THAT BREATHING SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE DROWSY SULTRINESS OF AN AMERICAN LANDSCAPE IN JULY PERVADED THE SECLUDED SPOT INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE LOW VOICES OF THE MEN
A FEW LONG LOW AND MOSS COVERED PILES WERE SCATTERED AMONG THEM LIKE THE MEMORIALS OF A FORMER AND LONG DEPARTED GENERATION ALL THESE MINUTE PARTICULARS WERE NOTED BY THE SCOUT WITH A GRAVITY AND INTEREST THAT THEY PROBABLY HAD NEVER BEFORE ATTRACTED
HIS FORM SHRINKING INTO A CROUCHING AND ABJECT ATTITUDE AS IF ANXIOUS TO FILL AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL HAD TAKEN HIS PROPER STATION AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE PLACE THE GRAY HAIRED CHIEF ALREADY INTRODUCED TO THE READER
HUMAN POWER COULD NOT HOWEVER MUCH LONGER ENDURE SO SEVERE A TRIAL OF THIS THE CAPTIVE SEEMED CONSCIOUS PROFITING BY THE MOMENTARY OPENING HE DARTED FROM AMONG THE WARRIORS AND MADE A DESPERATE
IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
THE HURONS STAGGERED DESERTING THE CENTER OF THEIR LINE AND UNCAS ISSUED FROM THE FOREST THROUGH THE OPENING THEY LEFT AT THE HEAD OF A HUNDRED WARRIORS
BREATHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT AND HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH THE CRITICAL SITUATION OF HIS FRIEND HEYWARD RECOILED BEFORE THE LOOK TREMBLING LEST ITS MEANING MIGHT IN SOME UNKNOWN MANNER HASTEN THE PRISONER'S FATE
IS ORIENTAL CHASTENED AND PERHAPS IMPROVED BY THE LIMITED RANGE OF HIS PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE HE DRAWS HIS METAPHORS FROM THE CLOUDS THE SEASONS THE BIRDS THE BEASTS
HE DETERMINED TO BRING MATTERS TO AN ISSUE BY UNMASKING HIS FORCE AND PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY BUT STEADILY UP THE STREAM THE SCOUT HAD STOOD WHILE MAKING HIS OBSERVATIONS SHELTERED BY A BRAKE AND HIS COMPANIONS STILL LAY IN THE BED OF THE RAVINE THROUGH WHICH THE SMALLER STREAM DEBOUCHED
BEFORE THE BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES THAT FORMED THE THICKET WERE CAUTIOUSLY MOVED ASUNDER AND A HUMAN VISAGE
SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
ITS POWER EXCEEDED THAT OF THE PARTING DAY AND ASSISTED TO RENDER OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HIDEOUS THE WHOLE SCENE FORMED A STRIKING PICTURE WHOSE FRAME WAS COMPOSED OF THE DARK AND TALL BORDER OF PINES
AS THOUGH IMPELLED BY A FATE TO WHOSE DECREES HE SUBMITTED SEEMINGLY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HEYWARD PROFITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GAZE IN HIS FACE SECRETLY APPREHENSIVE HE MIGHT FIND THE FEATURES OF ANOTHER ACQUAINTANCE
THE PLACE SEEN BY ITS DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT APPEARED LIKE THE SHADES OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS ACROSS WHICH UNHAPPY GHOSTS AND SAVAGE DEMONS WERE FLITTING IN MULTITUDES STILL UNCAS KEPT HIS EYE ON MAGUA AS IF LIFE TO HIM POSSESSED BUT A SINGLE OBJECT
AND INDICATING THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE JOINED AT THE ROOT HE ANSWERED
A CERTAIN EVIDENCE THAT THE DELAWARES TRIUMPHED NOR DID HE ACTUALLY QUIT THE PLACE UNTIL ADMONISHED OF THE PROXIMITY OF HIS FRIENDS AS WELL AS ENEMIES BY THE BULLETS OF THE FORMER WHICH BEGAN TO PATTER AMONG THE DRIED LEAVES ON THE GROUND LIKE THE BITS OF FALLING HAIL WHICH PRECEDE THE BURSTING OF THE TEMPEST
EXISTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SHEET OF WATER AS EVERY WORD UTTERED BY NATTY BUMPPO WAS NOT TO BE RECEIVED AS RIGID TRUTH WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF PUTTING THE HORICAN INTO HIS MOUTH
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE EXAMPLE OF THE JEWISH BOY WITH THIS ANCIENT INSTRUMENT OF WAR HAVE I PRACTISED MUCH IN MY YOUTH AND PERADVENTURE THE SKILL HAS NOT ENTIRELY DEPARTED FROM ME AY SAID HAWKEYE CONSIDERING THE DEER SKIN THONG AND APRON WITH A COLD AND DISCOURAGING EYE
NOT A WORD WAS UTTERED THAT DID NOT CONVEY THE MEANING OF THE SPEAKER IN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST ENERGETIC FORM AGAIN A LONG AND DEEPLY SOLEMN PAUSE TOOK PLACE IT WAS KNOWN BY ALL PRESENT TO BE THE BRAVE PRECURSOR OF A WEIGHTY AND IMPORTANT JUDGMENT
BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES THREE TIMES HAVE THEY CALLED ON YOU TO COME AND AS OFTEN DID YOU FORGET TO ANSWER YOUR NAME WILL NEVER BE MENTIONED AGAIN IN YOUR TRIBE IT IS ALREADY FORGOTTEN
WHO HAD TAKEN THE NECESSARY PRECAUTION TO FIRE THE PILES MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG AND CLEARED A PLACE FOR HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAPTIVE THE SQUALID AND WITHERED PERSON OF THIS HAG MIGHT WELL HAVE OBTAINED FOR HER THE CHARACTER OF POSSESSING MORE THAN HUMAN CUNNING
IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
FOR A MOMENT HE APPEARED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HAVING THE WORST OF THE ARGUMENT THEN RALLYING AGAIN
PRESSED CLOSE UPON HIS HEELS AND WITH AN UPLIFTED ARM MENACED A FATAL BLOW DUNCAN THRUST FORTH A FOOT AND THE SHOCK PRECIPITATED THE EAGER SAVAGE HEADLONG MANY FEET IN ADVANCE OF HIS INTENDED VICTIM
THE BRIGHTER THOUGH SUN BURNED AND LONG FACED COMPLEXION OF ONE WHO MIGHT CLAIM DESCENT FROM A EUROPEAN PARENTAGE
THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
YOUR FATHERS CAME FROM THE SETTING SUN CROSSED THE BIG RIVER FOUGHT THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY AND TOOK THE LAND
THE SIGHT OF A COWARD'S BLOOD CAN NEVER MAKE A WARRIOR TREMBLE THE GRAY HEAD AND THE SAGAMORE ARE SAFE
THE DELIVERY OF THESE SKILLFUL RHYMES WAS ACCOMPANIED ON THE PART OF THE STRANGER BY A REGULAR RISE AND FALL OF HIS RIGHT HAND WHICH TERMINATED AT THE DESCENT BY SUFFERING THE FINGERS TO DWELL A MOMENT ON THE LEAVES OF THE LITTLE VOLUME
BUT THE CHANCES WERE GRADUALLY GROWING UNFAVORABLE TO HAWKEYE AND HIS BAND THE QUICK SIGHTED SCOUT PERCEIVED HIS DANGER WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO REMEDY IT HE SAW IT WAS MORE DANGEROUS TO RETREAT THAN TO MAINTAIN HIS GROUND WHILE HE FOUND HIS ENEMY THROWING OUT MEN ON HIS FLANK
WHETHER THE COLOR OF THE SKIN BE RED OR BLACK OR WHITE RETURNED DUNCAN EVASIVELY THOUGH CHIEFLY IS HE SATISFIED WITH THE BRAVE HURONS IN WHAT MANNER WILL HE SPEAK
THE CHIEF WAS SEATED ON A ROCK WITH NOTHING VISIBLE BUT HIS CALM VISAGE CONSIDERING THE SPECTACLE WITH AN EYE AS DELIBERATE AS IF HE WERE POSTED THERE MERELY TO VIEW THE STRUGGLE THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE DELAWARE TO STRIKE SAID DUNCAN NOT SO NOT SO RETURNED THE SCOUT
BUT THE WHOLE BODY OF HIS CAPTORS THREW THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM AND DROVE HIM BACK INTO THE CENTER OF HIS RELENTLESS PERSECUTORS TURNING LIKE A HEADED DEER HE SHOT WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN ARROW THROUGH A PILLAR OF FORKED FLAME
AND WERE SUCCEEDED BY SHRILL PIERCING YELLS
DISCOURAGED BY AN ASSAULT FROM A QUARTER THAT LEFT THEM NO OPPORTUNITY FOR COVER THE WARRIORS UTTERED A COMMON YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND BREAKING OFF IN A BODY THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES ACROSS THE OPENING HEEDLESS OF EVERY CONSIDERATION BUT FLIGHT
THAT FAR EXCEEDED ANY BEFORE HEARD THE MORE ABJECT OF THE TWO VICTIMS CONTINUED MOTIONLESS BUT THE OTHER BOUNDED FROM THE PLACE AT THE CRY WITH THE ACTIVITY AND SWIFTNESS OF A DEER INSTEAD OF RUSHING THROUGH THE HOSTILE LINES AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED
THERE SPEAKS THE SAGAMORE SHOUTED HAWKEYE ANSWERING THE CRY WITH HIS OWN STENTORIAN VOICE WE HAVE THEM NOW IN FACE AND BACK THE EFFECT ON THE HURONS WAS INSTANTANEOUS
DASHED THE TORCH TO THE EARTH AND BURIED EVERYTHING IN DARKNESS THE WHOLE SHUDDERING GROUP OF SPECTATORS GLIDED FROM THE LODGE LIKE TROUBLED SPRITES AND DUNCAN THOUGHT THAT HE AND THE YET THROBBING BODY OF THE VICTIM OF AN INDIAN JUDGMENT
WHICH WE BOAST EVEN BEFORE WE ARE MADE TO ENCOUNTER THE REDOUBTABLE MONTCALM YON INDIAN IS A RUNNER OF THE ARMY AND AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS PEOPLE HE MAY BE ACCOUNTED A HERO RETURNED THE OFFICER
WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
GLEN'S HAS A LARGE VILLAGE AND WHILE WILLIAM HENRY AND EVEN A FORTRESS OF LATER DATE ARE ONLY TO BE TRACED AS RUINS THERE IS ANOTHER VILLAGE ON THE SHORES OF THE HORICAN BUT BEYOND THIS
COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
THEN WITH A STERN AND STEADY LOOK HE TURNED TO LE SUBTIL AND INDICATED BY THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE ALL THAT HE WOULD DO HAD NOT THE POWER DESERTED HIM
MAN'S VOICE IS GIVEN TO HIM LIKE HIS OTHER TALENTS TO BE USED AND NOT TO BE ABUSED
THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
THAT THE DISAPPOINTED WOMEN DID NOT LAVISHLY EXPEND ON THE SUCCESSFUL STRANGER THEY FLOUTED AT HIS EFFORTS AND TOLD HIM WITH BITTER SCOFFS THAT HIS FEET WERE BETTER THAN HIS HANDS AND THAT HE MERITED WINGS
IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN ABODE THE SYMPATHY OF ONE LIKE HIMSELF AGED FORLORN AND CHILDLESS THE INDIANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUES AND DEFECTS IN CHARACTER
WITH SUCH PERSEVERING HARDIHOOD THE INDUSTRY AND MOVEMENTS OF THE RIDER WERE NOT LESS REMARKABLE THAN THOSE OF THE RIDDEN AT EACH CHANGE IN THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE LATTER THE FORMER RAISED HIS TALL PERSON IN THE STIRRUPS PRODUCING IN THIS MANNER
THE CHASE WAS RENEWED WITH A DILIGENCE RENDERED TENFOLD ENCOURAGING BY THIS GLIMPSE OF THE CAPTIVE BUT THE WAY WAS RUGGED BROKEN AND IN SPOTS NEARLY IMPASSABLE UNCAS ABANDONED HIS RIFLE AND LEAPED FORWARD WITH HEADLONG PRECIPITATION
BUT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON WHAT SCALE YOU LOOK AT THINGS NOW ON THE SMALL SCALE THE ARTH IS LEVEL BUT ON THE LARGE SCALE IT IS ROUND
AND AS HE HAD ALREADY PREPARED A SIMPLE AND PROBABLE TALE TO SUPPORT HIS PRETENDED OCCUPATION HIS HOPES OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS GREW BRIGHTER AFTER A SILENCE OF A FEW MOMENTS AS IF ADJUSTING HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER TO MAKE A SUITABLE ANSWER TO THE DECLARATION THEIR GUESTS HAD JUST GIVEN
THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
HE KNEW THAT THE HURON ENCAMPMENT LAY A SHORT HALF MILE UP THE BROOK AND WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC ANXIETY OF ONE WHO DREADED A HIDDEN DANGER
AND THE THICK SHRUBBERY WHICH SKIRTED THE STREAM NO PRECAUTION KNOWN TO AN INDIAN ATTACK WAS NEGLECTED A WARRIOR RATHER CRAWLED THAN WALKED ON EACH FLANK SO AS TO CATCH OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES INTO THE FOREST
CONTINUED THE PURSUIT WITH THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IN VAIN HAWKEYE CALLED TO HIM TO RESPECT THE COVERS THE YOUNG MOHICAN BRAVED THE DANGEROUS FIRE OF HIS ENEMIES AND SOON COMPELLED THEM TO A FLIGHT AS SWIFT AS HIS OWN HEADLONG SPEED
ARMS GLEAMING KNIVES AND FORMIDABLE CLUBS APPEARED ABOVE THEM BUT THE BLOWS WERE EVIDENTLY GIVEN AT RANDOM THE AWFUL EFFECT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE PIERCING SHRIEKS OF THE WOMEN AND THE FIERCE YELLS OF THE WARRIORS
THERE WAS AN INSTANT WHEN THE YOUNG SOLDIER WOULD HAVE RETREATED IT WAS HOWEVER TOO LATE TO APPEAR TO HESITATE THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN HAD DRAWN A DOZEN WARRIORS TO THE DOOR OF THE NEAREST LODGE WHERE THEY STOOD CLUSTERED IN A DARK AND SAVAGE GROUP
IN THE CASES OF SUCH SUPPOSED VISITATIONS HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED TO FURTHER HIS OWN ENDS IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT JUST THEN TO HAVE UTTERED A PROPOSAL
DOES NOT THIS STREAM AT OUR FEET RUN TOWARD THE SUMMER UNTIL ITS WATERS GROW SALT AND THE CURRENT FLOWS UPWARD
HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
I THANK HIM AN EVIL SPIRIT LIVES IN THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY YOUNG MEN CAN THE CUNNING STRANGER FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY HEYWARD POSSESSED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE MUMMERY PRACTISED AMONG THE INDIANS
AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
AS THOUGH ALL HAD INHALED AN IMPURITY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMOKE WREATHED ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN LITTLE EDDIES
ENCUMBERED BY HIS RIFLE AND PERHAPS NOT SUSTAINED BY SO DEEP AN INTEREST IN THE CAPTIVE AS HIS COMPANIONS THE SCOUT SUFFERED THE LATTER TO PRECEDE HIM A LITTLE UNCAS IN HIS TURN TAKING THE LEAD OF HEYWARD IN THIS MANNER ROCKS PRECIPICES AND DIFFICULTIES WERE SURMOUNTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE
HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE END OF THE LOW PILE OF BRUSH WHICH SUSTAINED DUNCAN THE LATTER CAST AN IMPATIENT LOOK AT HIS NEIGHBOR AND FELT HIS FLESH CREEP WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORROR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH MAGUA
IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
FIRST PRONOUNCED THE WORD STANDISH AND PLACING THE UNKNOWN ENGINE ALREADY DESCRIBED TO HIS MOUTH FROM WHICH HE DREW A HIGH SHRILL SOUND THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY AN OCTAVE BELOW FROM HIS OWN VOICE
OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
APPEALING TO EVERYONE EXCEPT HOOPDRIVER HERE'S ME GOT TO TAKE IN HER LADYSHIP'S DINNER TO MORROW NIGHT HOW SHOULD I LOOK WITH A BLACK EYE AND GOING ROUND WITH THE CARRIAGE
AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS
JESSIE AND HOOPDRIVER HAD SCARCELY TIME TO STAND UP AND SEIZE THEIR MACHINES BEFORE THIS TUMULTUOUS THIS SWIFT AND WONDERFUL PASSING OF DANGLE WAS ACHIEVED
CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
TO BE A HUMAN BEING NOT A THING IN A HUTCH AND HE I KNOW SAID HOOPDRIVER AND NOW HERE I AM I WILL DO ANYTHING SAID HOOPDRIVER SHE THOUGHT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STEPMOTHER NO I COULD NOT DESCRIBE HER
YES IT WAS MISTER DANGLE THAT WAS OUR BICYCLES DID THAT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SPEAKING WITH A CERTAIN COMPLACENT CONCERN I HOPE HE WON'T GET HURT
HE HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING HIS FEET HE FELT THAT HIS HEART WAS SMASHED FLAT GORD DARM SAID SOMEBODY DANCING TOE IN HAND SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM
AND WAS MOUNTING STILL STARING AT THE CORNER THAT HAD SWALLOWED UP DANGLE HOOPDRIVER FOLLOWED SUIT AND SO JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING THEY BEGAN ANOTHER FLIGHT TOGETHER RIDING NOW
AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
AS MISTER HOOPDRIVER STAGGERED CHARLES GAVE A LOUD AND FEAR COMPELLING CRY HE SEEMED TO TOWER OVER HOOPDRIVER IN THE MOONLIGHT
A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
BULLER'S YARD SAID THE MAN WITH THE GAITERS TAKING THE CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE AFFAIR WITH THE EASY READINESS OF AN ACCOMPLISHED PRACTITIONER IF THE GENTLEMAN DON'T MIND
BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF
AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
WITH A SLIGHT CATCH IN HIS THROAT THAN WHICH THREAT OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE NOTHING HAD BEEN FURTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS ON ENTERING THE ROOM HE SAID THIS BECAUSE HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO SAY
NEVER LET THE MACHINE BUCKLE THERE WAS A MAN KILLED ONLY THE OTHER DAY THROUGH HIS WHEEL BUCKLING DON'T SCORCH DON'T RIDE ON THE FOOT PATH KEEP YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IF YOU SEE A TRAMLINE GO ROUND THE CORNER AT ONCE AND HURRY OFF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY
HULLO SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SOTTO VOCE THEY DISMOUNTED ABRUPTLY STUNTED OAKS AND THORNS ROSE OUT OF THE HAZE OF MOONLIGHT THAT WAS TANGLED IN THE HEDGE ON EITHER SIDE
IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S HEAD THE MOMENT BEFORE HE HEARD THAT REMARK BUT THE REMARK TOPPLED HIM HEADLONG WHAT THE PRECISE REMARK WAS NEED NOT CONCERN US IT WAS
THEY LISTENED TOGETHER HIS FEET STOPPED TURNED WENT OUT OF THE DININGROOM DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE BEDROOM STOPPED AGAIN POOR CHAP SAID THE BARMAID SHE'S A WICKED WOMAN SSSH SAID STEPHEN
BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL
FIGURE OF CHARLES AND HE SAW THAT THE MAN IN GAITERS
THE CURVATURE OF HIS CALF VERY NICE LADY INDEED I CAME HERE SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER WITH A LADY WE SAW YOU DID BLESS YOU SAID THE FAT MAN WITH THE CHINS
SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING VERY STERN AND HARSH
PROMISED TO HELP AND PROTECT ME I WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME NEVER MIND WHY A STEPMOTHER IDLE UNOCCUPIED HINDERED CRAMPED THAT IS ENOUGH PERHAPS THEN HE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND TALKED TO ME OF ART AND LITERATURE AND SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE
HE'S GONE DOWN THAT HILL AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PULL UP FOR A BIT I'M CERTAIN
QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING SAID HOOPDRIVER WITH SPLENDID READINESS MY SISTER HAD GONE TO BOGNOR BUT I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE I'VE TOOK A FANCY TO THIS PLACE AND THE MOONLIGHT'S SIMPLY DEE VINE WE'VE HAD SUPPER THENKS AND WE'RE TIRED SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER
RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
IT WASN'T THAT ONE AT ALL MISS SAID THE OSTLER I'D SWEAR WELL THAT'S MISTER BEAUMONT SAID THE BARMAID ANYHOW THEIR CONVERSATION HUNG COMATOSE IN THE AIR SWITCHED UP BY BECHAMEL
I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
THE ROADS ABOUT HERE ARE ALL RIGHT
WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
DANGLE HAD FLARED AND THUNDERED ACROSS THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE SUMMER EVENING DANGLE SWAYING AND GESTICULATING BEHIND A CORYBANTIC BLACK HORSE HAD HAILED JESSIE BY HER NAME
HE ROSE WITH A FINE SURPRISE GONE HE SAID WITH A HALF LAUGH GONE SIR ON HER BICYCLE ON HER BICYCLE WHY SHE WENT SIR WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THIS TIME BECHAMEL WAS REALLY STARTLED
THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
I'M NOT TALKING I'M GOING TO DO IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE MEETING THEY WERE NO LONGER ANTAGONISTS THEY WERE SPECTATORS HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT NOW
THE LEFT AS ONE WHO KNEW SO IT WAS THAT IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR THEY CAME ABRUPTLY DOWN A LITTLE LANE FULL TILT UPON THE SEA
WHO WOULD BE HOOPDRIVER ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS BUT THE CHRISTIAN NAME CHRISTIAN NAME MY CHRISTIAN NAME WELL CHRIS HE SNAPPED HIS LAMP AND STOOD UP IF YOU WILL HOLD MY MACHINE I WILL LIGHT YOURS HE SAID
TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
HE CROSSED THE HALL BY THE BAR
I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
NOWHERE WAS THE MOON SHINING QUITE SO BRIGHTLY AS IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S SKULL AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD HE MADE HIS DECISIONS WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND PROMPTITUDE AND QUITE HAPHAZARD THE RIGHT HE WOULD SAY OR AGAIN
SHE DID NOT HEAR IT HE CONCLUDED FROM HER SUBSEQUENT BEARING BUT DURING THE SUPPER THEY HAD IN THE LITTLE PRIVATE DINING ROOM THOUGH SHE TALKED CHEERFULLY
THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
AT THAT HOOPDRIVER THE CHILD OF FATE ROSE TOO WITH A HORRIBLE SENSE THAT HIS INTERNAL MONITOR WAS RIGHT THINGS HAD TAKEN A TURN HE HAD MADE A MESS OF IT
CHARLES KINDLY BUT FIRMLY BY THE ARM IT'S BLASTED ROT CHARLES WAS SAYING
I
AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
DAMNED UNPLEASANT PEOPLE DAMNED UNPLEASANT PEOPLE OH SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE GAITERS APPARENTLY MAKING A MENTAL INVENTORY OF HIS PEARL BUTTONS AS HE SPOKE HOW'S THAT
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY POWER I HAVE LOST AN ILLUSION AND FOUND A KNIGHT ERRANT SHE SPOKE OF BECHAMEL AS THE ILLUSION MISTER HOOPDRIVER FELT FLATTERED BUT HE HAD NO ADEQUATE ANSWER
TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
THAT'S FAIR AND REASONABLE SAID THE MAN IN THE VELVETEEN JACKET IF YOU CAN
HE WENT FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE ROAD WORSE EVEN THAN THE RIDING FORTH OF MISTER HOOPDRIVER IT WAS AND VANISHED ROUND THE CORNER
ALL RIGHT THEN SAID CHARLIE WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF FRONT AND SPRINGING TO HIS FEET IF I MUST I MUST NOW THEN
MISTER HOOPDRIVER
WHERE HEALTHY HOMELY PEOPLE GATHER TOGETHER
BUT IT CHANCED TO COINCIDE WITH THE REGULATION HOOK HIT AT THE HEAD HE PERCEIVED WITH A LEAP OF EXULTATION THAT THE THING HIS FIST HAD MET WAS THE JAWBONE OF CHARLES
MORE POSSIBLY THAN YOU WILL DESIRE THE REMARK I MUST ADD IMPLICATED MISTER HOOPDRIVER IT INDICATED AN ENTIRE DISBELIEF IN HIS SOCIAL STANDING
IT WAS THE SOLE GLEAM OF PLEASURE HE EXPERIENCED DURING THE FIGHT AND IT WAS QUITE MOMENTARY HE HAD HARDLY GOT HOME UPON CHARLES BEFORE HE WAS STRUCK IN THE CHEST AND WHIRLED BACKWARD
HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
YOU WERE SAYING SAID THE FAIR YOUNG MAN WITH THE WHITE TIE SPEAKING VERY POLITELY THAT YOU CAME HERE WITH A LADY A LADY MEDITATED THE GAITER GAZER
THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
THEN WITH INFINITE FERVOUR HE SAID BUT LET US PUT IN BLANK CARTRIDGE HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMCHAIR DAMN HER SAID BECHAMEL FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A COMMON MAN
WE HAVE TURNED AND TURNED AGAIN IT SEEMED TO HOOPDRIVER THAT HE HEARD HER SOB SHE STOOD DIMLY THERE HOLDING HER MACHINE AND HE HOLDING HIS COULD GO NO NEARER TO HER TO SEE IF SHE SOBBED FOR WEEPING OR FOR WANT OF BREATH
HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO DAY SAID THE MAN IN THE VELVETEEN COAT YOU GOT TO DO IT CHARLIE SAID THE MAN IN GAITERS IT'S NO GOOD IT'S LIKE THIS SAID CHARLIE
WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP
SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH TO BREAK THE INTENSITY HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SHUT IT AGAIN AND WITH A SUDDEN WINCING OF HIS FEATURES ABRUPTLY TURNED AND BENT DOWN TO OPEN THE LANTERN IN FRONT OF HER MACHINE SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
WHO HAD STEPPED ACROSS THE DOORWAY AND ABOUT THE HANDSOME FLAXEN MOUSTACHED BLUE EYED CAVALIER WHO HAD FOLLOWED HER IN AND THEY WOULD LOOK ONE TO ANOTHER
VERY PLEASANT ROADS ABOUT HERE SAID THE FAIR YOUNG MAN WITH THE WHITE TIE VERY SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER EYEING HIM DARKLY HAVE TO BEGIN SOMEHOW
ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
MARCHING IN A QUIET BUSINESS LIKE WAY TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN HORROR AT BULLER'S YARD FISTS IT WAS ASTONISHING IT WAS TERRIBLE IN FRONT OF HIM WAS THE PALLID
ONE MINUTE SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER IT WASN'T I BEGAN CALLING NAMES WHO DID SAID THE MAN WITH THE CHINS I'M NOT CALLING ANY OF YOU DIRTY CADS DON'T RUN AWAY WITH THAT IMPRESSION
HE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHAME OF HIS HOMELY PATRONYMIC IT'S AN UGLY NAME HE SAID BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN TRUSTING ME I WOULD I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU THIS
ARE YOU TIRED HE ASKED I WILL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE THE TWO BLACK FIGURES IN THE BROKEN LIGHT WERE SILENT FOR A SPACE DO YOU KNOW SHE SAID I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU I AM SURE YOU ARE HONEST TO ME
HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
IF SO HE WAS IN FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT HE HAD IT READY SHE WAS A MONOMANIAC LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HER HE WOULD SAY I KNOW HOW TO CALM HER MISSUS BEAUMONT SAID STEPHEN WELL HAS GONE
FOR HIS IDEAS WERE STILL A LITTLE HAZY ABOUT BECHAMEL AND MISSUS MILTON
HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
HE WAS EXPLAINING WITH A HAPPY FLUKE OF HIS IMAGINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS IGNORANCE THEN SUDDENLY HERALDED BY CLATTERING SOUNDS AND A GRIDE OF WHEELS
AS WITHOUT KNOCKING STEPHEN ENTERED BECHAMEL'S FACE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION BEG PARDON SIR SAID STEPHEN WITH A DIPLOMATIC COUGH WELL SAID BECHAMEL WONDERING SUDDENLY IF JESSIE HAD KEPT SOME OF HER THREATS
WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
THROUGH THE BACK PREMISES OF THE INN TO THE FIRST AND ONLY FIGHT WITH FISTS THAT WAS EVER TO GLORIFY HIS LIFE
IT'S FAIR AND SQUARE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WAS IT THIS GENT BEGAN MISTER HOOPDRIVER OF COURSE SAID THE YOUNG MAN IN THE WHITE TIE
SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
SIMPLY HAD TO IT SEEMS SO DREADFUL THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TO KNOCK PEOPLE ABOUT SAID JESSIE THESE LOUTS GET UNBEARABLE
YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
A YOUNG FELLOW SMOKING A CUTTY AND DISPLAYING CROSSED LEGS WITH GAITERS
THEN INCIDENT HAD FLICKERED INTO INCIDENT UNTIL HERE HE WAS OUT IN A MOONLIT LANE A SLIGHT DARK FIGURE IN A GROUP OF LARGER INDISTINCT FIGURES
AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
AFTER A PAUSE BECHAMEL WENT BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY HEARD A CHAIR CREAK UNDER HIM INTERLUDE OF CONVERSATIONAL EYEBROWS I'M GOING UP SAID STEPHEN TO BREAK THE MELANCHOLY NEWS TO HIM BECHAMEL LOOKED UP FROM A WEEK OLD NEWSPAPER
I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
WITH AN EXPECTANT REGARD SOME DIRTY CAD SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER PROCEEDING WITH HIS DISCOURSE AND SUDDENLY GROWING EXTREMELY FIERCE MADE A REMARK AS WE WENT BY THIS DOOR
ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
PROCEEDED HE OPENED THE DOOR ABRUPTLY AND STOOD SCOWLING ON THEM IN THE DOORWAY YOU'LL ONLY MAKE A MESS OF IT REMARKED THE INTERNAL SCEPTIC THERE WERE FIVE MEN IN THE ROOM ALTOGETHER
THAT SHOWED HE WASN'T FIT TO WIPE BOOTS ON AND WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE TO SUCH GENTLEMEN AS ARE GENTLEMEN MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKED ROUND FOR MORAL SUPPORT I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IT WAS
PROTESTED CHARLIE YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
OWN UP CHARLIE SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE GAITERS
SAID THE FAIR YOUNG MAN IN A TONE OF MILD SURPRISE I AM SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER WITH EMPHATIC RESOLUTION AND GLARED IN THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE
THAT HIS STRAY SHOT HAD HIT HE HAD THROWN IT AS A BOY THROWS A STONE AT A BIRD AND IT NOT ONLY DEMOLISHED A FOOLISH HAPPY CONCEIT BUT IT WOUNDED IT TOUCHED JESSIE GROSSLY
GHASTLY WHITE UNDER THE MOON SQUARING IN FRONT OF HIM HE CAUGHT A BLOW ON THE ARM AND GAVE GROUND CHARLES PRESSED HIM THEN HE HIT WITH HIS RIGHT
OCCASIONALLY JESSIE HAD TO SLACKEN HER PACE
HE'S OFFERED TO HIT YOU AND IF I WAS HIM
TO NO LIBERTIES GOOD EVENING
OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE
THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
A SMELL OF COWS AND A PUMP STOOD OUT CLEAR AND BLACK THROWING A CLEAR BLACK SHADOW ON THE WHITEWASHED WALL AND HERE IT WAS HIS FACE WAS TO BE BATTERED TO A PULP
HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
AND THE FLANKING MOVEMENT WAS COMPLETED ANOTHER BLOW BEHIND THE EAR HEAVEN AND EARTH SPUN FURIOUSLY ROUND MISTER HOOPDRIVER AND THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF A FIGURE IN A LIGHT SUIT
HIM COME OUT ANYHOW HE COULD PROSECUTE THEM FOR ASSAULT IF THEY DID HOW DID ONE SET ABOUT PROSECUTING FOR ASSAULT HE SAW CHARLES WITH HIS FACE
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
THAT IT WAS OFTEN THE FANCY OF SUCH GREAT FOLK TO SHUN THE BIG HOTELS THE ADULATION OF URBAN CROWDS AND SEEK INCOGNITO THE COSY QUAINTNESSES OF VILLAGE LIFE
THE FACT OF IT IS SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SITTING BESIDE THE ROAD TO SALISBURY AND WITH THE SOUND OF DISTANT CHURCH BELLS IN HIS
SHE WHO HAS SPIRITUALISED THE WORLD ALONE SAVE FOR TWO ATTENDANT STEADY SHINING STARS AND IN SILENCE UNDER HER BENIGN INFLUENCE UNDER THE BENEDICTION OF HER LIGHT RODE OUR TWO WANDERERS SIDE BY SIDE THROUGH THE TRANSFIGURED AND TRANSFIGURING NIGHT
THE MUTE EMOTION OF HIS FACE AFFECTED HER STRANGELY SHE HAD TO SPEAK
BUT AS YET HE SEEMED MERELY STUNNED BROWN CLOTHES HE SAID AND FAIRISH A LITTLE LIKE YOURSELF SIR IN THE DARK THE OSTLER SIR JIM DUKE
A FAT PERSON WITH A LONG PIPE AND A GREAT NUMBER OF CHINS IN AN ARMCHAIR BY THE FIREPLACE WHO WISHED MISTER HOOPDRIVER A GOOD EVENING VERY AFFABLY
OUTWARDLY SO FAR AS THE INTERMITTENT MOONLIGHT SHOWED
KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
STEPHEN WAS TOO SURPRISED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT BOURBON SIR GO ON SAID BECHAMEL DAMN YOU STEPHEN'S SYMPATHIES CHANGED AT ONCE YESSIR HE MURMURED FUMBLING FOR THE DOOR HANDLE AND LEFT THE ROOM MARVELLING
EXACTLY SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER DRIVING IT HOME WITH GREAT FIERCENESS WHY DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR UGLY MOUTH IT'S AS MUCH AS MY SITUATION'S WORTH
CAME FLOATING IN ALL THROUGH SUPPER HE HAD BEEN COMPOSING
THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
TELL YOU WHAT IT IS ONE OF THE VILLAGE ELDERS WOULD SAY JUST AS THEY DO IN NOVELS
FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
NOT OF A SPINDLE LEGGED CUSS LIKE HIM SHOUTED CHARLIE BECAUSE I AIN'T CHANGE OF FRONT
THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
AND WITH THE VIOLENCE OF DESPAIR IT WAS A HIT OF HIS OWN DEVISING AN IMPROMPTU
IT WAS ANNIHILATION COMING NO LESS MISTER HOOPDRIVER DUCKED PERHAPS AND CERTAINLY GAVE GROUND TO THE RIGHT HIT AND MISSED CHARLES SWEPT ROUND TO THE LEFT MISSING GENEROUSLY
EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
AN OTHER GENTLEMEN WHO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN BROWN SIR WENT INTO THE YARD SIR GOT OUT THE TWO BICYCLES SIR AND WENT OFF SIR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO BECHAMEL STOOD WITH HIS EYES ROUND AND HIS KNUCKLE ON HIS HIPS
AND STUCK OUT HIS ELBOWS TRUCULENTLY TO HIDE THE SINKING OF HIS HEART IT IS CURIOUS HOW SITUATIONS RUN AWAY WITH US ULLO CHARLIE
HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
SHARPLY AND WENT OFF INTO AN AMIABLE CHUCKLE WE KNOW IT BY ART SAID THE LITTLE MAN ELABORATING THE POINT MISTER HOOPDRIVER TEMPORARILY LOST HIS THREAD
UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
AND WITH WHAT WAS ONLY TOO PALPABLY A FOOTMAN GOOD HEAVENS
THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER IF NOW AND THEN WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM A LESSON WELL
BULLER'S YARD IT SEEMED WAS THE VERY PLACE WE'LL DO THE THING REGULAR AND DECENT IF YOU PLEASE AND BEFORE HE COMPLETELY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING HOOPDRIVER WAS BEING MARCHED OUT
GROUND WITH HIS BACK TO THE GATE HOW DID ONE SQUARE SO SUPPOSE ONE WERE TO TURN AND RUN EVEN NOW RUN STRAIGHT BACK TO THE INN AND LOCK HIMSELF INTO HIS BEDROOM
CARRY ONE OR TWO LEMONS WITH YOU DON'T TEAR YOURSELF TO DEATH THE FIRST DAY AND SIT UPRIGHT NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND ALWAYS SOUND THE BELL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY YOU MIND THOSE THINGS AND NOTHING VERY MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU HOOPDRIVER YOU TAKE MY WORD
THAT WAS A PRETTY CUT UNDER THE JAW YOU GAVE HIM THE TOOTHLESS LITTLE MAN WITH THE BEARD WAS REMARKING IN AN UNEXPECTEDLY FRIENDLY MANNER
MAKING A MEMORABLE SAYING LET EM GO WHO CARES AND I WISH HIM LUCK AND BRING ME SOME BOURBON AS FAST AS YOU CAN THERE'S A GOOD CHAP
HE STOOD LISTENING AND FEARING SOME NEW OFFENCE AS SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ROUND THE BEND
THE MAN IN VELVETEEN WHO WAS LOOKING FROM ONE SPEAKER TO ANOTHER WITH KEEN BRIGHT EYES NOW LAUGHED AS THOUGH A POINT HAD BEEN SCORED AND STIMULATED MISTER HOOPDRIVER TO SPEAK BY FIXING HIM
THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS HE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HIMSELF WALKING ACROSS FROM ONE ROOM TO THE OTHER A DIGNIFIED EVEN AN ARISTOCRATIC FIGURE PRIMED WITH CONSIDERED ELOQUENCE
IDIOTIC FOLLY AT THUS BEARDING THESE LIONS INDISPUTABLY THEY WERE LIONS BUT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH IT NOW
YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR BROTHER MISS BEAUMONT YES WE COULD STOP THERE TOGETHER SHE TOOK A MINUTE TO ANSWER I AM GOING TO LIGHT THESE LAMPS SAID HOOPDRIVER HE BENT DOWN TO HIS OWN AND STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS SHOE
GO ROUND THE TABLE AT HIM I SUPPOSE BUT BEFORE THE BRAWL COULD ACHIEVE ITSELF THE MAN IN GAITERS INTERVENED NOT HERE HE SAID
NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
AT A BLOW IT SHATTERED ALL THE GORGEOUS IMAGINATIVE FABRIC HIS MIND HAD BEEN REJOICING IN ALL THAT FOOLISH HAPPINESS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT AS
FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
SAID THE FAIR YOUNG MAN WITH THE WHITE TIE VERY SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SLOWLY AND TAKING A BROWN ARMCHAIR HE PLANTED IT WITH GREAT DELIBERATION WHERE HE FACED THE FIREPLACE AND SAT DOWN
WHAT WE HAD BEST BE DOING YOU ARE TIRED YOU KNOW AND WE CAN'T WANDER ALL NIGHT AFTER THE DAY WE'VE HAD THAT WAS CHICHESTER WE WERE NEAR SHE ASKED IF HE MEDITATED WITH A TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER AND PAUSED TO INFLATE HIS CHEEKS WITH A LADY VERY NICE LADY SAID THE MAN WITH THE GAITERS PUTTING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO ADMIRE A PEARL BUTTON
MISTER HOOPDRIVER COUGHED I CAME HERE SIR
POSSIBLY SAID FRED IMPERTURBABLY READ THE MARK THERE IN TINY LETTERS CASSETTE SIX A OPERA CANNOT ENGLISH PEOPLE BUY CANES IN PARIS
I HAVE AMONG THE PAPERS THAT WERE SENT ME BY THE YOUNG MAN AFTER THE AFFAIR WAS OVER A NOTE BOOK OF HIS IN WHICH A COMPLETE ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE PHENOMENON OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MATTER OF THE ASSASSIN AND THE THOUGHTS TO WHICH IT GAVE RISE IN THE MIND OF MY YOUNG FRIEND
BUT BY HER GESTURES SHE BEGGED US TO LEAVE HER ALONE EXPRESSING WEARINESS AND THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE REST MONSIEUR STANGERSON ASKED US TO GO BACK TO OUR ROOMS AND THANKED US FREDERIC LARSAN AND I BOWED TO HIM AND FOLLOWED BY DADDY JACQUES WE REGAINED THE GALLERY
IF I COULD BUT MAKE THIS WOMAN WHO DOES NOT EVEN LOOK AT US UNDERSTAND SHE IS ABSORBED BY HER FEARS AND BY HER FATHER'S DISTRESS OF MIND AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HER YES
SAID ROULETABILLE WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS TURN OF HIS LIPS I FANCIED HE WAS A MUCH ABLER MAN I HAD INDEED A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HIM BEFORE I GOT TO KNOW HIS METHOD OF WORKING IT'S DEPLORABLE HE OWES HIS REPUTATION SOLELY TO HIS ABILITY
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND ROULETABILLE MAKING NONE OF THE PREPARATIONS I HAD EXPECTED HIM TO MAKE I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT WHEN NIGHT HAD COME ON
HAD MADE ALL SPEED DOUBTLESS KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HE WAS INTERRUPTED IN WHAT HE WAS DOING IT WAS BECAUSE HIS SERVICES WERE URGENTLY NEEDED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SO AS ROULETABILLE SAID HE WAS THAT MORNING ALREADY AT WORK
FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
WE COULD ONLY HAVE ANSWERED THAT THE ASSASSIN HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE GALLERY IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE THOUGHT HE WAS NO LONGER ANYWHERE HE HAD ELUDED US WHEN WE ALL HAD OUR HANDS STRETCHED OUT READY TO SEIZE HIM WHEN WE WERE ALMOST TOUCHING HIM
FROM THE QUESTIONS PUT BY HIM FROM THE EXPLANATION WHICH HE GIVES ME IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT IN SPITE OF ALL OUR SENSES
ROULETABILLE RETURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND SAID NOW WE'LL GRILL OUR STEAK
NAMELY HOW THE MURDERER ESCAPED FROM THE YELLOW ROOM WITHOUT ANY ACCOMPLICE AND WITHOUT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON HAVING HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT SO LONG AS I AM NOT SURE OF THE REAL MURDERER I CANNOT STATE THE THEORY ON WHICH I AM WORKING
DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME TO FIND DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS NEAR THE SPOT WHERE WE NOTICED THE TRACES OF THE NEAT BOOTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ROUGH ONES THERE WAS A SQUARE HOLE FRESHLY MADE IN THE MOIST GROUND
MONSIEUR STANGERSON HAD FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DINED WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN THE DRAWING ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR AS THE DOOR REMAINED OPEN WE DISTINCTLY SAW MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON
ON THE EVENING OF THE CRIME ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK MONSIEUR CASSETTE HAD NOT SOLD ANOTHER SUCH CANE DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS FRED'S CANE IS NEW IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT IT'S THE SAME CANE FRED DID NOT BUY IT SINCE HE WAS IN LONDON
HAD WE KNOWN THESE FACTS AT THE TIME ARTHUR RANCE MET US AT THE DONJON INN
WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT MORNING WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACROBAT HE GOT INTO THE LODGE BY AN UPPER WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND RETURNED TEN MINUTES LATER HE SAID ONLY AH A WORD WHICH IN HIS MOUTH
DON'T LET US DISTURB HIM ROULETABILLE HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE CELEBRATED DETECTIVE I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM BUT I KNEW HIM WELL BY REPUTATION AT THAT TIME
BECAUSE FREDERIC LARSAN HAS NOT QUITTED THE BORDERS OF IT SINCE THIS MORNING THERE MUST BE SOME IMPORTANT MARKS THERE A FEW MINUTES LATER WE REACHED THE LAKE IT WAS A LITTLE SHEET OF MARSHY WATER SURROUNDED BY REEDS
YOU SEE THERE ARE STEPS THAT COME AND STEPS THAT GO BACK AND THE MAN HAD A BICYCLE CRIED THE REPORTER HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE MARKS OF THE BICYCLE WHICH FOLLOWED GOING AND COMING THE NEAT FOOTPRINTS I THOUGHT I MIGHT INTERVENE
THERE COULD BE BUT TWO REASONS WHY HE HAD ASSISTED ME IN MY INVESTIGATION FIRST BECAUSE I FORCED HIM TO DO IT AND SECOND BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE THE BETTER PROTECTED I AM IN THE CHAMBER HER ROOM I LOOK AT HER
WE SAW NO MORE OF DADDY MATHIEU THAT DAY AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE INN WHEN WE LEFT IT AFTER PLACING FIVE FRANCS ON THE TABLE IN PAYMENT FOR OUR FEAST
WHO DESIRES TO SPEAK WITH HIM I REALLY DON'T KNOW MONSIEUR ROULETABILLE REPLIED FRED SHAKING HANDS WITH MY FRIEND WHOM HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES MET IN THE COURSE OF HIS DIFFICULT INVESTIGATIONS I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
HE SLIPPED BY THE MAN ON THE DOORSTEP AND WAS IN THE COMMON ROOM COME ON HE SAID IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE HERE A GOOD FIRE WAS BLAZING IN THE CHIMNEY AND WE HELD OUR HANDS TO THE WARMTH IT SENT OUT
RETURNED IT TO LARSAN WITH A BANTERING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE SAYING
CONTINUES ROULETABILLE'S NOTE BOOK WE WERE NEAR HER DOOR IN THE GALLERY WHERE THIS INCREDIBLE PHENOMENON HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN ONE FEELS AS IF ONE'S BRAIN WERE ABOUT TO BURST A BULLET IN THE HEAD
PROVE THAT HE ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE ONE STRIDE TO FIND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE VESTIBULE WINDOW LEFT OPEN BY DADDY JACQUES THE MAN DREW HIMSELF UP BY HIS HANDS AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE AFTER ALL IT IS VERY POSSIBLE
IF WE HAD A BICYCLE HERE WE MIGHT DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REASONING MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW THE DONJON INN WAS OF NO IMPOSING APPEARANCE BUT I LIKE THESE BUILDINGS WITH THEIR RAFTERS BLACKENED WITH AGE AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR HEARTHS THESE INNS OF THE COACHING DAYS CRUMBLING ERECTIONS THAT WILL SOON EXIST IN THE MEMORY ONLY
WE ENTERED AND I AFFECTED SURPRISE NOT GONE TO BED YET NO HE REPLIED ROUGHLY I HAVE BEEN MAKING A ROUND OF THE PARK AND IN THE WOODS I AM ONLY JUST BACK AND SLEEPY GOOD NIGHT LISTEN I SAID
THEN HE FITTED THE NEW PAPER PATTERN WITH THE ONE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE THE TWO WERE EXACTLY ALIKE
HIS FACE HAD CHANGED EXPRESSING FIERCE HATRED HE WENT AND GLUED HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS WATCHING THE ROAD
YOU'LL COME AND TAKE YOUR PLACE HERE
I STILL CATCH MYSELF REPEATING FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART SAVE HER SAVE HER WITHOUT HIS SPEAKING
WHY I ASKED MYSELF IF HE WAS REALLY AFRAID THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD BE DISCOVERED WAS HE HELPING THE REPORTER TO FIND HIM MY YOUNG FRIEND SEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME IMPRESSION FOR HE SAID BLUNTLY MONSIEUR DARZAC
I WAS SURPRISED THINKING SHE WAS STILL UNDER LOCK AND KEY THIS WOMAN SAID IN A VERY LOW TONE IN THE GROVE OF THE PARQUET ROULETABILLE REPLIED THANKS THE WOMAN THEN LEFT HE AGAIN TURNED TO ME HIS LOOK HAGGARD
THE MATHEMATICAL IDEA I HAVE OF THE MURDERER GIVES RESULTS SO FRIGHTFUL
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID BUT SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING THERE ARE NO TWO CATS IN THE WORLD THAT CRY LIKE THAT WELL ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER I ALSO HEARD THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU OUTSIDE
IF YOU USE IT INDISCRIMINATELY YOU ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THAT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON FIRED HER REVOLVER BUT YOU ARE WRONG WHEN YOU SAY THAT SHE WOUNDED THE MURDERER IN THE HAND I AM SURE OF IT
BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO SAY ON THIS AFFAIR IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS JUSTIFIED AND WHAT IS YOUR HYPOTHESIS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
HE WAS REMARKABLY HANDSOME AS HE PASSED NEAR THE INN HE HESITATED AS IF ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER OR NO HE SHOULD ENTER IT GAVE A GLANCE TOWARDS US TOOK A FEW WHIFFS AT HIS PIPE AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK AT THE SAME NONCHALANT PACE
I WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASED WITH MY DUTIES BUT I COULD NOT REFUSE ROULETABILLE THE ASSISTANCE HE HAD BEGGED ME TO GIVE HIM I TOOK CARE NOT TO MAKE HIM SEE
THE WOMEN FOR TWELVE MILES ROUND ARE ALL SETTING THEIR CAPS FOR HIM FOR THE PRESENT HE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO MADAME MATHIEU WHOSE HUSBAND IS KEEPING A LYNX EYE UPON HER IN CONSEQUENCE
THAT PATH IS AS YOU SEE TOPPED WITH GRAVEL HE SAID THE MAN MUST HAVE PASSED ALONG IT GOING TO THE PAVILION SINCE NO TRACES OF HIS STEPS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE SOFT GROUND THE MAN DIDN'T HAVE WINGS HE WALKED
IT WAS THEN SIX O'CLOCK BY HIS WATCH RISING HE MADE A SIGN TO ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND WITHOUT IN THE LEAST TYING TO CONCEAL HIS MOVEMENTS OR THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS
HE SEIZED THEM EAGERLY HIS FINGERS CARESSING THE GLASS THEN LOOKING AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR ON HIS FACE HE MURMURED OH OH HE REPEATED THE EXCLAMATION AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF HIS THOUGHTS HAD SUDDENLY TURNED HIS BRAIN
HE ALSO APPEARED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED FROM HIS POCKET BOOK HE TOOK A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER AS I HAD SEEN HIM DO BEFORE AND WITH HIS SCISSORS CUT OUT THE SHAPE OF THE NEAT BOOTMARKS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND
I SAID AND TO ME SAID LARSAN THE GREAT FRED AND I WERE ALONE IN HIS CHAMBER NOW TO TALK OVER THIS THING WE TALKED FOR AN HOUR TURNING THE MATTER OVER AND VIEWING IT FROM EVERY SIDE
ABOUT TO ENTER THE CHATEAU BY THAT WINDOW AS I EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT THIS PIECE OF NOCTURNAL GYMNASTICS
THE MAN ALLOWED THE BLOOD TO FLOW INTO HIS HAND AND HANDKERCHIEF AND DRIED HIS HAND ON THE WALL THE FACT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT HE ADDED BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED OF HIS BEING WOUNDED IN THE HAND FOR HIM TO BE THE MURDERER
WITH RAPID STRIDES FINALLY HE SET OFF RUNNING STILL LOOKING INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND ROULETABILLE HAD BROUGHT ME TO A STANDSTILL BY A GESTURE HUSH FREDERIC LARSAN IS AT WORK
AS THERE WERE OTHER PATCHES OF TREES OF THE SAME SORT BETWEEN THE GREAT OAKS I ASKED WHY THE MURDERER HAD CHOSEN THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
THEN HE TURNED BACK STILL RUNNING STOPPING ONLY WHEN HE REACHED THE PARK GATE WHERE HE AGAIN CONSULTED HIS WATCH AND THEN PUT IT AWAY IN HIS POCKET SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WITH A GESTURE OF DISCOURAGEMENT
BUT I MUST MAKE HASTE ABOUT IT FOR HE HAS AN ENORMOUS START ON ME GIVEN HIM BY MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO IS THIS EVENING GOING TO INCREASE IT STILL MORE
THEN GIVE ME A GLASS OF WHITE WINE SAID THE GREEN MAN WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE I'VE NO MORE WHITE WINE NO MORE ANYTHING SAID DADDY MATHIEU SURLILY HOW IS MADAME MATHIEU QUITE WELL THANK YOU
THAT THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AT THE TIME YOU SAY I ADMIT I SAID BUT WHY DID HE SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS AN ACT WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT IT OPEN IT MAY BE THE WINDOW WAS NOT SHUT AT ONCE REPLIED THE YOUNG REPORTER
SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
IT IS NOT MY FAULT IF IN THE DOCUMENT WHICH I HAVE CITED ROULETABILLE THOUGHT FIT TO REFER TO HIS CHILDHOOD BUT NOW SINCE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INEXPLICABLE GALLERY I DID NOT REASON AT ALL I STOOD THERE
HE STAMMERED THEN SUDDENLY AND WITH A SORT OF FURY HE REPEATED LET US GO MONSIEUR HE TURNED UP BY THE ROAD HE HAD COME FROM THE CHATEAU ROULETABILLE STILL RETAINING HIS HOLD ON THE HORSE'S BRIDLE
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MURDER OF THE MURDER OF POOR MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GOOD GIRL MUCH LOVED EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF IT AND MANY THINGS BESIDES BUT THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS NOT EVEN MINE
THAT THE MURDERER HAD SOUGHT TO TURN SUSPICION ON TO THE OLD SERVANT UP TO THAT POINT
AT THE OUTSET OF THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM
HER FATHER TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER PASSIONATELY AS IF HE HAD RECOVERED HER AFTER BEING LONG LOST TO HIM
WHILE TO LARSAN IT SHOWED NOTHING BUT CONSUMMATE HYPOCRISY ACTED WITH FINISHED ART BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE AS WE REACHED THE PARK GATE LARSAN STOPPED US
EVERY TIME THE MURDERER COMES TO THE CHATEAU MONSIEUR DARZAC BY A STRANGE FATALITY ABSENTS HIMSELF AND REFUSES TO GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF HOW HE EMPLOYS HIS TIME EVERY TIME THE ASSASSIN COMES TO THE CHATEAU I CRIED
AND PICKED UP HIS CANE FROM THE GROUND A PROCEEDING TO WHICH I WAS PERHAPS WRONG NOT TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE WE WERE NOW OUT OF THE PARK ROULETABILLE HAD DROPPED INTO SILENCE
THAT ROULETABILLE LED ME TO THE GROTTO OF SAINTE GENEVIEVE AND ALL THE TIME TALKED OF EVERY SUBJECT BUT THE ONE IN WHICH WE WERE MOST INTERESTED
THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO KNOW NOTHING BUT I IF I KNEW WHO I SHOULD KNOW ALL WHO WHO NOT KNOWING WHO I MUST REMAIN SILENT OUT OF PITY FOR HER
BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE MAN WITH THE BEARD AT ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS OF THIS CASE I THEN LEARNED THAT THE YOUTH WAS ONE OF LARSAN'S ASSISTANTS AND HAD BEEN CHARGED BY HIM TO WATCH THE GOING AND COMING OF TRAVELLERS AT THE STATION OF EPINAY SUR ORGE
IT WAS A SPLENDID PLACE FROM WHICH TO OBSERVE AND REMAIN UNOBSERVED I WAS SOON TO PLAY THE PART OF A SPY A COMMON POLICEMAN
AND SUPPOSE THAT A MURDERER WOULD DROP FROM THE CLOUDS SO DON'T SAY A THING IS POSSIBLE WHEN IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WE KNOW NOW HOW THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AND WE ALSO KNOW THE MOMENT AT WHICH HE ENTERED
AND HE CALLED TO FREDERIC LARSAN MONSIEUR FRED THESE NEAT FOOTPRINTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME YES YOUNG MAN YES THEY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY MADE REPLIED FRED WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
AS WELL AS IF I HAD BEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF ARTHUR RANCE'S DOOR AND I COULD WATCH THAT DOOR TOO THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET WHICH WAS TO BE MY PLACE OF OBSERVATION
ON WHICH FLOATED SOME DEAD WATER LILY LEAVES THE GREAT FRED MAY HAVE SEEN US APPROACHING BUT WE PROBABLY INTERESTED HIM VERY LITTLE FOR HE TOOK HARDLY ANY NOTICE OF US AND CONTINUED TO BE STIRRING WITH HIS CANE SOMETHING WHICH WE COULD NOT SEE LOOK
AND SEEMED TO TAKE AS LITTLE NOTICE OF OUR HOST AS OUR HOST DID OF HIM THE LANDLORD LET US DO OUR OWN COOKING AND SET OUR TABLE NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS SUDDENLY I HEARD HIM MUTTER AH THERE HE IS
PROVE TO ME THAT THE MURDERER WAS NOT WOUNDED AT ALL
FOR EVERY WORD THE AMERICAN WOULD SAY THE MAN'S PURPLISH RED FACE
HE IS HERE THE CAB WAS ALREADY AT THE PARK GATE AND ROBERT DARZAC WAS BEGGING FREDERIC LARSAN TO OPEN IT FOR HIM EXPLAINING THAT HE WAS PRESSED FOR TIME TO CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN LEAVING EPINAY FOR PARIS THEN HE RECOGNISED ME
PASSING PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S APARTMENT AT THE FAR END OF THE GALLERY BEFORE COMING TO THE DONJON IS THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY ARTHUR RANCE WE KNEW THAT
I SUGGESTED HE IS AS TALL AS HE WANTS TO BE MURMURED FRED I UNDERSTAND I SAID BUT HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR HIS RED HAIR AND BEARD TOO MUCH BEARD TOO MUCH HAIR FALSE SAYS FRED
WE APPROACHED UNTIL WE HAD REACHED THE SIDE OF A DOOR THAT WAS SITUATED JUST UNDER THE WINDOW ROULETABILLE IN A LOW TONE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS THE WINDOW OF MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S CHAMBER
AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PLACE THREE NIGHTS AGO
HE ANSWERED THAT HE HOPED IT WOULD HE DESIRED NOTHING MORE I DID NOT INSIST KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE HOW USELESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HE TOLD ME THAT
ROULETABILLE OPENED IT A FIGURE ENTERED
IT'S DANGEROUS VERY DANGEROUS MONSIEUR FRED TO GO FROM A PRECONCEIVED IDEA TO FIND THE PROOFS TO FIT IT THAT METHOD MAY LEAD YOU FAR ASTRAY BEWARE OF JUDICIAL ERROR MONSIEUR FRED IT WILL TRIP YOU UP
AND I REPLIED YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION THAT WAS THE VERY TRUTH IN TRUTH IN TRUTH MONSIEUR DARZAC KNEW THE MURDERER SO WELL THAT WHILE WISHING TO KILL HIM HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID I SHOULD FIND HIM
THE OLD STONES THE STAGNANT WATER OF THE DITCH SURROUNDING THE DONJON THE BLEAK GROUND STREWN WITH THE DEAD LEAVES THE DARK SKELETON LIKE OUTLINES OF THE TREES ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE TO THE DESOLATE PLACE NOW FILLED WITH ITS AWFUL MYSTERY
IT IS OF MUCH TOO GRAVE A NATURE TO SPEAK OF IT SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO BE ONLY A HYPOTHESIS HAVE YOU AT LEAST SOME IDEA AS TO WHO THE MURDERER IS NO MONSIEUR I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MURDERER IS
WE SOON FOUND OUT IN WHAT IT CONSISTED WHAT HE WAS CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT IN THE PALM OF HIS RIGHT HAND WAS NOTHING BUT HIS WATCH THE MINUTE HAND OF WHICH HE APPEARED TO BE NOTING INTENTLY
MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THEY WERE FIXED ON MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS FEET SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEGANT FOOTMARKS THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
WHY THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU WOULD TURN THEIR EYES AWAY FROM A PICTURE OF HIM THE CONCIERGES OF THE CHATEAU ARE HONEST PEOPLE THEN YES THEY ARE AS TRUE AS MY NAME'S MATHIEU MONSIEUR I BELIEVE THEM TO BE HONEST YET THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
THE FRIENDLINESS WITH WHICH HE WAS RECEIVED AT THE GLANDIER MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD ONCE RENDERED MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GREAT SERVICE BY STOPPING
AND THE MEAT WHICH WAS ON A DISH PLACED ALL CAREFULLY BESIDE HIM IN THE CHIMNEY UNHOOKED A FRYING PAN AND A GRIDIRON AND BEGAN TO BEAT UP OUR OMELETTE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO GRILL OUR BEEFSTEAK HE THEN ORDERED TWO BOTTLES OF CIDER
BUT HE LACKS REASONING POWER THE MATHEMATICS OF HIS IDEAS ARE VERY POOR I LOOKED CLOSELY AT ROULETABILLE AND COULD NOT HELP SMILING ON HEARING THIS BOY OF EIGHTEEN TALKING OF A MAN WHO HAD PROVED TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS THE FINEST POLICE SLEUTH IN EUROPE YOU SMILE
SHE HAD A FANCY NOT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN HER CHAMBER BUT IN THE BOUDOIR WITH HER NURSES
SAID ROULETABILLE HERE AGAIN ARE THE FOOTMARKS OF THE ESCAPING MAN THEY SKIRT THE LAKE HERE AND FINALLY DISAPPEAR JUST BEFORE THIS PATH WHICH LEADS TO THE HIGH ROAD TO EPINAY THE MAN CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT TO PARIS
ROULETABILLE HAD MOUNTED ALONE AND HAD RETURNED WITH ANOTHER GOOD EVENING MONSIEUR SAINCLAIR IT WAS FREDERIC LARSAN THE DETECTIVE HAD ALREADY OCCUPIED THE POST OF OBSERVATION
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE HANDKERCHIEF FULL OF BLOOD AND THE RED MARK OF THE HAND ON THE WALL YOU HAVE SEEN THE STAIN ON THE WALL BUT I HAVE ONLY SEEN THE HANDKERCHIEF BAH CRIED ROULETABILLE THE MURDERER WAS WOUNDED IN THE HAND BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S REVOLVER AH
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ACCOMPLICES
NO REPLIED MONSIEUR DARZAC THERE IS NOT I TOOK MINE FOUR DAYS AGO TO PARIS THE LAST TIME I CAME TO THE CHATEAU BEFORE THE CRIME THAT'S A PITY REPLIED FRED VERY COLDLY
IF WE GO ON AT THIS RATE WE'LL BOTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION HAVE YOU ANY IDEA AS TO HOW THE MURDERER GOT AWAY FROM THE YELLOW ROOM YES SAID MY YOUNG FRIEND I HAVE AN IDEA
THE SOUNDS WHICH HAD ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION CEASED THEN WERE RENEWED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WE HEARD STIFLED SOBS WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO CATCH THESE WORDS WHICH REACHED US DISTINCTLY
BUT IF HE DID SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE BEND IN THE GRAVEL PATH A DOZEN YARDS FROM THE PAVILION AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE THREE OAKS THAT ARE GROWING AT THAT SPOT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
WHICH HE AT ONCE STIFLED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT OUR ORDERS AS OBEDIENTLY AS MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HAD DONE
AND NOW DESPAIRING FACE AT LENGTH REGAINING HIS SELF POSSESSION HE BOWED TO US AND REMARKING IN A CHANGED VOICE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE CHATEAU
HE SAID WITH AN AIR OF SUPREME IRONY YOU CAN ALWAYS INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF DISCOVERING ACCOMPLICES DID YOU HAVE THEM ARRESTED MONSIEUR FRED NOT I I HAVEN'T HAD THEM ARRESTED
I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF HIM HIS ONLY ANSWERS ARE GRUNTS AND SHRUGS OF THE SHOULDERS HE GENERALLY LIVES ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE DONJON A BIG ROOM THAT ONCE SERVED FOR AN ORATORY HE LIVES LIKE A BEAR NEVER GOES OUT WITHOUT HIS GUN AND IS ONLY PLEASANT WITH THE GIRLS
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE MUST COME ROULETABILLE VERY SLOWLY FILLED HIS PIPE AND LIT IT THAT MEANT AN INTERESTING STORY AT THAT MOMENT WE HEARD SOME ONE WALKING IN THE GALLERY AND PASSING BEFORE OUR DOOR ROULETABILLE LISTENED
AFTER A MOMENT HE SAID THERE IS SOMETHING A SOMETHING
ASKED THE REPORTER POURING HIS OMELETTE INTO THE FRYING PAN NOBODY LIKES HIM MONSIEUR HE'S AN UPSTART WHO MUST ONCE HAVE HAD A FORTUNE OF HIS OWN AND HE FORGIVES NOBODY BECAUSE IN ORDER TO LIVE HE HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO BECOME A SERVANT
I WANTED TO BE CERTAIN THE LADY HAD NOT BEEN KILLED AND I SHALL NOT GO AWAY UNTIL SHE IS PERFECTLY RECOVERED ARTHUR RANCE THEN TOOK THE LEAD IN TALK
WITH WHICH TO SINK THE BOOTS IN THE LAKE
HE SPOKE THE LAST SENTENCE WITH UNCONCEALED IRONY THEN HE ROSE BOWED TO US AND LEFT
THEN THEY ARE THE MURDERERS FREDERIC LARSAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHEN YOU CAN'T
IT WAS A MORNING IN WHICH THE APPROACH OF WINTER WAS UNMISTAKABLE THE ROOM WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE ONE FURNISHED WITH TWO HEAVY TABLES SOME STOOLS A COUNTER DECORATED WITH ROWS OF BOTTLES OF SYRUP AND ALCOHOL
I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN YOU WALKING WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS IT IS A PRESENT REPLIED THE DETECTIVE RECENT INSISTED ROULETABILLE NO IT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN LONDON
NEVERTHELESS HE INSISTED ON ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE STATION AT EPINAY IN CROSSING THE PARK HE SAID TO ME FREDERIC IS REALLY VERY CLEVER AND HAS NOT BELIED HIS REPUTATION
AND COMMANDS AN UNINTERRUPTED VIEW OF THE GALLERY FROM END TO END OF THE CHATEAU THAT OFF TURNING GALLERY SAID ROULETABILLE I RESERVE FOR MYSELF WHEN I TELL YOU
THE GREAT FRED SPOKE QUITE SERIOUSLY HOWEVER I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM UTTERING AN EXCLAMATION THE REPORTER LOOKED GRAVELY AT FRED WHO LOOKED GRAVELY AT HIM AND FRED IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDED
A KEEPER IS AS MUCH A SERVANT AS ANY OTHER ISN'T HE UPON MY WORD
THAT ESCAPED ME BUT MY MIND WAS TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FALSE INDICATIONS OF HIS TRACK WHICH THE MURDERER LEFT AND BY THE MEASURE OF THE BLACK FOOT MARKS CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS
THE FACE OF ROULETABILLE AT THE MOMENT WAS REALLY FUNNY TO LOOK AT IT SHOWED SUCH AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD BEYOND WHICH SOME PRODIGIOUS MYSTERY HAD OCCURRED IT APPEALED WITH SO MUCH ELOQUENCE NOT ONLY OF THE MOUTH AND EYES
THE DAY AFTER THE GLANDIER CRIME NEVER MOVE A STEP WITHOUT ONE
YES TERRIBLE TERRIBLE
FRED PASSED THE CANE TO ROULETABILLE IT WAS A LARGE YELLOW BAMBOO WITH A CRUTCH HANDLE AND ORNAMENTED WITH A GOLD RING
WE ENTERED A WINE SHOP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR OPENED AND FREDERIC LARSAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE BRANDISHING HIS FAMOUS CANE
AND THEN DADDY JACQUES LEAVE THE PAVILION GRAVEL HAS BEEN SPREAD NEARLY VERY NEARLY UP TO THE WINDOWS OF THE PAVILION THE FOOTPRINTS OF A MAN PARALLEL WITH THE WALL MARKS WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE PRESENTLY AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SEEN
IN HIS POCKET I CLOSELY SCRUTINISED HIM HE MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE HE HAD A FINE HEAD HIS HAIR TURNING GREY A COLOURLESS COMPLEXION AND A FIRM PROFILE
THAT'S A FINE FIRE FOR ROASTING A CHICKEN SAID ROULETABILLE WE HAVE NO CHICKEN NOT EVEN A WRETCHED RABBIT SAID THE LANDLORD I KNOW SAID MY FRIEND SLOWLY I KNOW
AND MONSIEUR DARZAC ON HIS KNEES BY HER PILLOW I GUESSED THAT EACH HAD DRAWN DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE SCENE HAD STRONGLY IMPRESSED ROULETABILLE IN FAVOUR OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
THE NERVOUS TWITCHINGS ALL SPOKE OF HIS ADDICTION TO DRINK HOW CAME IT THAT SO SORRY A SPECIMEN OF A MAN SHOULD BE SO INTIMATE WITH MONSIEUR STANGERSON
IT WAS EVIDENTLY INTENDED NOT TO GIVE US ANY ASSISTANCE IN OUR RESEARCHES I WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT FREDERIC LARSAN HAD ALWAYS RESENTED THIS CONDUCT IT IS TRUE THAT HE AND I HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THEORY OF THE CRIME
THE CAT AT HER FEET YOU'VE BEEN ILL MOTHER ANGENOUX IS THAT WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK ASKED THE GREEN MAN
HE CLASPED THE TRUNK WITH HIS VIGOROUS ARMS AND CLIMBED UP I SOON LOST SIGHT OF HIM AMID THE BRANCHES AND THEN FOLLOWED A DEEP SILENCE IN FRONT OF ME THE OPEN WINDOW REMAINED LIGHTED
PAYING NO HEED TO SOME OF ROULETABILLE'S QUESTIONS HE GAVE US WITHOUT OUR INVITING HIM HIS PERSONAL VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TRAGEDY VIEWS WHICH
AND SHE ENTERED FOLLOWED BY A CAT LARGER THAN ANY I HAD EVER BELIEVED COULD EXIST THE BEAST LOOKED AT US
NO NO THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN THERE THE MURDERER ON FOOT BRAVO BRAVO CRIED FRED AGAIN AND COMING SUDDENLY TOWARDS US AND PLANTING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HE SAID TO HIM
I EXPECT THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC WILL BE ARRESTED IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK
DID HE REMEMBER THAT PHRASE IN THE ELYSEE GARDEN MUST I COMMIT A CRIME THEN TO WIN YOU AGAINST WHOM THE CRIME IF NOT AGAINST THE OBSTACLE AGAINST THE MURDERER AH I WOULD KILL HIM WITH MY OWN HAND
LIKE ME HE HAD INSISTED ON BEING ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE UNHAPPY LADY
WHEN ROULETABILLE HAD SEEN ME INTO THE TRAIN HE SAID YOU'LL REMEMBER THE ADDRESS YES CASSETTE SIX A OPERA RELY ON ME YOU SHALL HAVE WORD TOMORROW MORNING
I HEARD LARSAN MURMUR STRANGE STRANGE HE MADE A SIGN TO ME TO GO WITH HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THE THRESHOLD HE TURNED TOWARDS DADDY JACQUES DID YOU SEE HIM DISTINCTLY HE ASKED WHO THE MAN
YOU ARE A BRIGHT LITTLE FELLOW THE AMERICAN EXTENDED HIS HAND AND ROULETABILLE RELAXING HIS FROWN SHOOK IT AND INTRODUCED MISTER ARTHUR RANCE TO ME
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHO TELL ME WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT RED MEAT NOW BUT IF IT WILL INTEREST YOU TO KNOW IT THAT MAN IS THE MURDERER WITH WHICH WORDS DADDY MATHIEU IMMEDIATELY LEFT US
THAT HE ADMIRED THE PRUDENT DOUBT WITH WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE APPROACHED THE MOST SIMPLE PROBLEMS RISKING NOTHING BY SAYING THAT IS SO OR THAT IS NOT SO
WHILE LARSAN WAS UNLOCKING THE GATE MONSIEUR DARZAC INQUIRED WHAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THE GLANDIER AT SUCH A TRAGIC MOMENT I NOTICED THAT HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY PALE AND THAT HIS FACE WAS LINED AS IF FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOME TERRIBLE SUFFERING IS MADEMOISELLE GETTING BETTER
THAT MONSIEUR DARZAC HAD DONE CLEVERLY IN ALLYING HIMSELF WITH MONSIEUR JOSEPH ROULETABILLE WHO COULD NOT FAIL SOONER OR LATER TO DISCOVER THE MURDERER
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO INCREASE OUR INTEREST IN THE MAN HIMSELF
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING LARSAN'S BAD TEMPER ON RE ENTERING THE CHATEAU I HEARD HIM MUTTER IT WOULD BE STRANGE
AND WROTE TO MY FRIEND A MAN UNMISTAKABLY ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC SAME HEIGHT SLIGHTLY STOOPING PUTTY COLOURED OVERCOAT BOWLER HAT PURCHASED A CANE SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED
FISH THAT HE SAID DO YOU THINK HE'LL PASS THE NIGHT AT THE GLANDIER I ASKED TO MY AMAZEMENT THE YOUNG REPORTER ANSWERED THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF ENTIRE INDIFFERENCE TO HIM
MY POOR ROBERT ROULETABILLE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
I GO TO THE DOOR AND RAP SMARTLY ON IT
AND FREDERIC LARSAN HIMSELF IS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY TO HIDE HIS EMOTION FOR MYSELF I AM ABLE NEITHER TO THINK OR FEEL I FELT AN INFINITE CONTEMPT FOR MYSELF
ARE YOU SURE OF THAT AS I AM OF PARADISE THEN HOW WAS IT MADAME ANGENOUX THAT ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER NOTHING BUT THE CRY OF THE BETE DU BON DIEU WAS HEARD
HIS FOOTSTEPS LEFT NO TRACES BEHIND THEM HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN IN THE CHAMBER FOR HOURS
IT PASSES ALL BELIEF THE THEORY I HAVE FORMED FROM THE INCIDENT IS SO ABSURD THAT I WOULD RATHER MATTERS REMAINED AS YET UNEXPLAINED
BEING ON A LEVEL WITH THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE CHATEAU FROM THE HEIGHT OF THOSE BRANCHES ONE MIGHT CERTAINLY SEE WHAT WAS PASSING IN MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S CHAMBER EVIDENTLY THAT WAS WHAT ROULETABILLE THOUGHT FOR ENJOINING ME TO REMAIN HIDDEN
I IMMEDIATELY ASKED YES HE SAID SHE WILL BE SAVED PERHAPS SHE MUST BE SAVED HE DID NOT ADD OR IT WILL BE MY DEATH BUT I FELT THAT THE PHRASE TREMBLED ON HIS PALE LIPS
OUR GOOD PATRONESS AND THE REST OF THE TIME I HAVE BEEN LYING ON MY BED THERE WAS NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME BUT THE BETE DU BON DIEU DID SHE NOT LEAVE YOU NEITHER BY DAY NOR BY NIGHT
BY SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE MEANS HAD BEEN ABLE TO ELUDE US THEN FOLLOWS A SILENCE WHAT A SILENCE WE ARE ALL THERE LOOKING AT HER HER FATHER LARSAN DADDY JACQUES AND I
SAID ROULETABILLE RAISING HIS HAT AND SHOWING THE PROFOUND RESPECT BASED ON ADMIRATION WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT FOR THE CELEBRATED DETECTIVE CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC IS AT THE CHATEAU AT THIS MOMENT HERE IS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS OF THE PARIS BAR
WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE I LOOKED AT LARSAN HIS FACE WAS IMPENETRABLE WELL I SAID WELL HE REPEATED
WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED PHRENOLOGISTS OF THE NEW WORLD OWING TO NEW EXPERIMENTS HE HAD MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES BEYOND THE SCIENCE OF GALL AND LAVATER
I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR AND THEN BECAUSE BECAUSE OF WHAT ASKED ROULETABILLE EAGERLY BECAUSE OF NOTHING SAID LARSAN SHAKING HIS HEAD
THE THREE OF US WENT BACK TOWARDS THE PAVILION AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BUILDING THE REPORTER MADE US STOP AND POINTING TO A SMALL CLUMP OF TREES TO THE RIGHT OF US SAID THAT'S WHERE THE MURDERER CAME FROM TO GET INTO THE PAVILION
CIRCUMSTANCES THINGS PEOPLE NOT AN HOUR PASSES WITHOUT BRINGING SOME NEW EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE IS OVERWHELMED BY IT AND BLIND FREDERIC LARSAN HOWEVER IS NOT A NOVICE I SAID I THOUGHT SO
THEIR INTELLIGENCE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED ABOUT THE SAME RESULT IF NATURE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FURNISH THEIR BRAIN PAN WITH A LITTLE GREY MATTER AS I APPEARED VEXED MY YOUNG FRIEND TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT FOR ME HE THOUGHT MORE OF ME THAN THAT
FRED IMPERTURBABLE INTERRUPTED HIM DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE EXAMINATION OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ROUND SCARLET STAINS THE IMPRESSION OF DROPS WHICH I FOUND IN THE TRACKS OF THE FOOTPRINTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE MADE ON THE FLOOR
THE ONLY SOUND TO BE HEARD WAS THE CRUNCHING OF THE DEAD LEAVES BENEATH OUR FEET THE SILENCE WAS SO INTENSE THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THE CHATEAU HAD BEEN ABANDONED
THE DOOR OF THE BOUDOIR WAS OPEN THE TERRIFIED FACES OF THE TWO NURSES CRANED TOWARDS US MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON INQUIRED THE MEANING OF ALL THE DISTURBANCE THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER OWN ROOM WAS QUITE EASILY EXPLAINED QUITE EASILY
PERMITS US TO AFFIRM THAT AT HALF PAST ONE THE MURDERER WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER UNDER THE BED UNLESS HE WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE CHAMBERMAID WHAT DO YOU SAY MONSIEUR DARZAC MONSIEUR DARZAC SHOOK HIS HEAD
IF I DID NOT REASON AS I DO IN REGARD TO THIS GRAVEL HE WENT ON I SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME A BALLOON MY DEAR FELLOW THE SCIENCE OF THE AEROSTATION OF DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS IS NOT YET DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONSIDER IT
MEANTIME THE MAN HAD PUSHED OPEN A LITTLE SIDE DOOR AND CALLED TO SOMEBODY TO BRING HIM HALF A DOZEN EGGS AND A PIECE OF BEEFSTEAK THE COMMISSION WAS QUICKLY EXECUTED BY A STRONGLY BUILT YOUNG WOMAN WITH BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HAIR AND LARGE HANDSOME EYES
BUT WITH ALL ITS FEATURES THAT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER FREDERIC LARSAN NO MORE THAN MYSELF COULD RETAIN HIS GRAVITY MEANWHILE STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE HE CALMLY PUT THE KEY
AND LAUGHING A LITTLE IN A SLIGHTLY BANTERING TONE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
KNOWN TO HIM ALONE HE KNOWS THE CHATEAU HE SAID TO ME HE KNOWS IT WELL
AT THAT MOMENT WE PASSED BY THE BACK OF THE CHATEAU NIGHT HAD COME A WINDOW ON THE FIRST FLOOR WAS PARTLY OPEN A FEEBLE LIGHT CAME FROM IT AS WELL AS SOME SOUNDS WHICH DREW OUR ATTENTION
AND WHETHER HE IS SO MUCH CLEVERER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
HE HELD OUT A PACKET TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO TOOK IT EAGERLY AND WENT OUT BY THE DOOR CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY HER CAT THEN YOU WON'T SERVE ME ASKED THE GREEN MAN DADDY MATHIEU'S FACE WAS PLACID AND NO LONGER RETAINED ITS EXPRESSION OF HATRED
AND THAT HE WAS SURE NOW OF THE ROAD TAKEN BY THE MURDERER HE WENT ALONG THE WALL TO THE HEDGE AND DRY DITCH OVER WHICH HE JUMPED SEE JUST IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PATH LEADING TO THE LAKE THAT WAS HIS NEAREST WAY TO GET OUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WENT TO THE LAKE
I WILL GO TO WORK ONCE MORE AND ACCOMPLISH WONDERS I MOVE TOWARDS HER
WITHOUT WHOSE SERVICE THE SCHOOL NEVER COULD HAVE BECOME WHAT IT IS THIS WAS MISTER WARREN LOGAN WHO NOW FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS HAS BEEN THE TREASURER OF THE INSTITUTE AND THE ACTING PRINCIPAL DURING MY ABSENCE
OF THE BLACK MAN AND THE SOUTHERN WHITE MAN I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM IT WAS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA WHERE HE WAS THEN LIVING I HAD HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM WHEN I FIRST WENT INTO HIS PRESENCE
THE SIGHT OF THE NEW BUILDING MADE IT A DAY OF THANKSGIVING FOR THEM NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MISTER BEDFORD CONSENTED TO BECOME ONE OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SCHOOL AND IN THAT CAPACITY AND AS A WORKER FOR IT
BUT NEVER SEEMED HAPPY UNLESS SHE WAS GIVING ALL OF HER STRENGTH TO THE CAUSE WHICH SHE LOVED OFTEN AT NIGHT AFTER SPENDING THE DAY IN GOING FROM DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO INTEREST PERSONS IN THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN THE GENERAL TOLD ME FURTHER THAT THESE MEETINGS WERE TO BE HELD NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF HAMPTON BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF TUSKEGEE AND THAT THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE WAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE EXPENSES
WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THE PLANS FOR A NEW LARGE BUILDING A SOUTHERN WHITE MAN WHO WAS OPERATING A SAWMILL NOT FAR FROM TUSKEGEE
THEY FELL INTO A CONVERSATION AND THE NORTHERN LADY BECAME SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE EFFORT BEING MADE AT TUSKEGEE THAT BEFORE THEY PARTED MISS DAVIDSON WAS HANDED A CHECK FOR FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE OUR MARRIAGE AND ALSO AFTER IT
BRICK MASONRY CARPENTRY BLACKSMITHING ET CETERA WOULD BE DONE BY THE STUDENTS THE MONEY WHICH YOU WOULD GIVE WOULD NOT ONLY SUPPLY THE BUILDING BUT THE ERECTION OF THE BUILDING WOULD GIVE A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THE BUILDING TRADES
IS KEPT CLEAN AND PURE AND WHOLESOME THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW THE LATE COLLIS P HUNTINGTON THE GREAT RAILROAD MAN HE GAVE ME TWO DOLLARS FOR OUR SCHOOL THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WHICH WAS A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED
AND THAT THE MAN WHO DOES THIS ENDS HIS CAREER OF DISHONESTY BY THE THEFT OF PROPERTY OR BY SOME EQUALLY SERIOUS CRIME IN MY OPINION THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE SOUTH WILL ENCOURAGE ALL OF ITS CITIZENS TO VOTE IT WILL SEE THAT IT PAYS BETTER FROM EVERY STANDPOINT TO HAVE HEALTHY VIGOROUS LIFE
THAT WE WERE MERELY SKIMMING OVER THE SURFACE IN THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING HOLD OF THE STUDENTS IN THEIR HOME LIFE WE HAD NOTHING BUT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR APPETITES WITH WHICH TO BEGIN A BOARDING DEPARTMENT
GRADUALLY THOUGH I NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT A SENTIMENT IN FAVOUR OF WORK WAS GAINING GROUND AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF HARD WORK THE FOUNDATIONS WERE READY AND A DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR THE LAYING OF THE CORNER STONE
THE BURNING OF A KILN REQUIRED ABOUT A WEEK TOWARD THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK WHEN IT SEEMED AS IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD MANY THOUSAND BRICKS IN A FEW HOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE KILN FELL
BUT IT MAY FEEL ITS NEED OF BRICKS AND HOUSES AND WAGONS IF THE MAN CAN SUPPLY THE NEED FOR THOSE THEN IT WILL LEAD EVENTUALLY TO A DEMAND FOR THE FIRST PRODUCT
WAS AN OLD BLIND HORSE GIVEN US BY ONE OF THE WHITE CITIZENS OF TUSKEGEE PERHAPS I MAY ADD HERE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME THE SCHOOL OWNS OVER TWO HUNDRED HORSES COLTS MULES COWS CALVES AND OXEN
WHEN MISTER HUNTINGTON GAVE ME THE FIRST TWO DOLLARS I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR NOT GIVING ME MORE BUT MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WAS GOING TO CONVINCE HIM BY TANGIBLE RESULTS THAT WE WERE WORTHY OF LARGER GIFTS
HE SHOULD MORE AND MORE BE INFLUENCED BY THOSE OF INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER WHO ARE HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS I KNOW COLOURED MEN WHO THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT HELP AND ADVICE OF SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE
EXCEPT THAT I LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO AS MANY PARTS OF THE STATE AS I COULD FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPEAKING TO THE PARENTS AND SHOWING THEM THE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION BESIDES
PERSONS WHO AT OTHER TIMES DID NOT USE STRONG DRINK THOUGHT IT QUITE THE PROPER THING TO INDULGE IN IT RATHER FREELY DURING THE CHRISTMAS WEEK THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD HILARITY
THAT IS OUR BUILDING I HELPED PUT IT UP IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SCHOOL I THINK MY MOST TRYING EXPERIENCE WAS IN THE MATTER OF BRICKMAKING
OFTEN AS IT HAPPENED WHEN DURING THE WEEK I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN NOT GETTING A CENT FROM THE VERY INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM I MOST EXPECTED HELP AND WHEN I WAS ALMOST BROKEN DOWN AND DISCOURAGED
BUT AFTER THE FIRST BURST OF ENTHUSIASM BEGAN TO DIE AWAY AND THE COLOURED PEOPLE BEGAN READING THE SPEECH IN COLD TYPE SOME OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HYPNOTIZED THEY SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN MY REMARKS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN WHITES
THERE IS NO DEFENCE OR SECURITY FOR ANY OF US EXCEPT IN THE HIGHEST INTELLIGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALL IF ANYWHERE THERE ARE EFFORTS TENDING TO CURTAIL THE FULLEST GROWTH OF THE NEGRO LET THESE EFFORTS BE TURNED INTO STIMULATING ENCOURAGING AND MAKING HIM THE MOST USEFUL AND INTELLIGENT CITIZEN
TREMBLING BECAUSE OF MY YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND SO CORDIALLY AND SPOKE SUCH ENCOURAGING WORDS AND GAVE ME SUCH HELPFUL ADVICE REGARDING THE PROPER COURSE TO PURSUE THAT I CAME TO KNOW HIM THEN
I KNEW THAT THE PRESUMPTION WAS AGAINST US I KNEW THAT IN THE CASE OF WHITE PEOPLE BEGINNING SUCH AN ENTERPRISE IT WOULD BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SUCCEED BUT IN OUR CASE I FELT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE SUCCEEDED
WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE ME FROM THE EXPERIENCE ADAM HAD IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THAT GOD HAD CURSED ALL LABOUR AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS A SIN FOR ANY MAN TO WORK FOR THAT REASON THIS MAN SOUGHT TO DO AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE
FOR DAYS FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK TO THE PRESENT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING AND LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS OUR TEACHERS WITH THE SAME IDEA THAT THE SCHOOL WILL ALWAYS BE SUPPORTED IN PROPORTION AS THE INSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION
AND THAT A NEGRO BE PLACED UPON THE BOARD OF JURORS OF AWARD WOULD ANY SUCH RECOGNITION OF THE RACE HAVE TAKEN PLACE I DO NOT THINK SO
IN PROPORTION AS ONE LOSES HIMSELF IN THE WAY IN THE SAME DEGREE DOES HE GET THE HIGHEST HAPPINESS OUT OF HIS WORK MY EXPERIENCE IN GETTING MONEY FOR TUSKEGEE HAS TAUGHT ME TO HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS CONDEMNING THE RICH
AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS ENOUGH WAS SECURED TO REPAY THE LOAN OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO GENERAL MARSHALL AND WITHIN TWO MONTHS MORE WE HAD SECURED THE ENTIRE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAD RECEIVED A DEED OF THE ONE HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND
TO PASS NOT ONLY UPON THE EXHIBITS OF THE COLOURED SCHOOLS BUT ALSO UPON THOSE OF THE WHITE SCHOOLS I ACCEPTED THE POSITION AND SPENT A MONTH IN ATLANTA IN PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES WHICH IT ENTAILED
NO PROVISION HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NEW BUILDING FOR A KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT BY DIGGING OUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF EARTH FROM UNDER THE BUILDING WE COULD MAKE A PARTIALLY LIGHTED BASEMENT ROOM
WE TRIED SEVERAL LOCATIONS BEFORE WE OPENED UP A PIT THAT FURNISHED BRICK CLAY I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT BRICKMAKING WAS VERY SIMPLE BUT I SOON FOUND OUT BY BITTER EXPERIENCE THAT IT REQUIRED SPECIAL SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE
IN PERFORMING MY DUTIES IN THE INSPECTION OF THE EXHIBITS OF WHITE SCHOOLS I WAS IN EVERY CASE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND AT THE CLOSE OF OUR LABOURS I PARTED FROM MY ASSOCIATES WITH REGRET
RECTOR OF TRINITY CHURCH BOSTON TO PREACH THE COMMENCEMENT SERMON AS WE THEN HAD NO ROOM LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL WHO WOULD BE PRESENT THE PLACE OF MEETING WAS UNDER A LARGE IMPROVISED ARBOUR
A SHORT TIME AGO WE RECEIVED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM MISTER ANDREW CARNEGIE TO BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING OUR FIRST LIBRARY AND READING ROOM WERE IN A CORNER OF A SHANTY
MISS DAVIDSON DECIDED TO GO NORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR WEEKS SHE VISITED INDIVIDUALS AND SPOKE IN CHURCHES AND BEFORE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
ONE MAN MAY GO INTO A COMMUNITY PREPARED TO SUPPLY THE PEOPLE THERE WITH AN ANALYSIS OF GREEK SENTENCES THE COMMUNITY MAY NOT AT THE TIME BE PREPARED FOR OR FEEL THE NEED OF GREEK ANALYSIS
TO BE MORE CORRECT I THINK I SHOULD SAY THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHEN ONE TAKES A BROAD SURVEY OF THE COUNTRY HE WILL FIND THAT THE MOST USEFUL AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN IT ARE THOSE WHO TAKE THE DEEPEST INTEREST
IN MY EFFORTS TO GET MONEY I HAVE OFTEN BEEN SURPRISED AT THE PATIENCE AND DEEP INTEREST OF THE MINISTERS WHO ARE BESIEGED ON EVERY HAND AND AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY FOR HELP IF NO OTHER CONSIDERATION HAD CONVINCED ME OF THE VALUE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
WERE BETTER THEN THAN THEY WERE ELSEWHERE I TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN STUDYING THE LIFE OF OUR PEOPLE THERE CLOSELY AT THAT TIME I FOUND THAT WHILE AMONG THEM THERE WAS A LARGE ELEMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL WORTHY CITIZENS
ENCLOSED I SEND YOU A NEW YORK DRAFT FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE USED IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR WORK I HAD PLACED THIS SUM IN MY WILL FOR YOUR SCHOOL
BUT GRADUALLY WITH PATIENCE AND HARD WORK WE BROUGHT ORDER OUT OF CHAOS JUST AS WILL BE TRUE OF ANY PROBLEM IF WE STICK TO IT WITH PATIENCE AND WISDOM AND EARNEST EFFORT
ABOUT THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF THE SCHOOL MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN SOME PRETTY TIGHT PLACES WHILE COLLECTING MONEY IN THE NORTH THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT I HAVE NEVER RELATED BUT ONCE BEFORE
CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GLADLY PUT ALL THE LUMBER NECESSARY TO ERECT THE BUILDING ON THE GROUNDS WITH NO OTHER GUARANTEE FOR PAYMENT THAN MY WORD THAT IT WOULD BE PAID FOR WHEN WE SECURED SOME MONEY
THE AMBITION TO SECURE AN EDUCATION WAS MOST PRAISEWORTHY AND ENCOURAGING THE IDEA HOWEVER WAS TOO PREVALENT THAT AS SOON AS ONE SECURED A LITTLE EDUCATION
WAS NOT MAKING HIM WORTHLESS BUT THAT IN EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS WE WERE ADDING SOMETHING TO THE WEALTH AND COMFORT OF THE COMMUNITY AS THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD CAME TO US TO BUY BRICKS WE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
BUT NOT ALL THE COLOURED PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OFFICE DURING RECONSTRUCTION WERE UNWORTHY OF THEIR POSITIONS BY ANY MEANS SOME OF THEM LIKE THE LATE SENATOR B K BRUCE GOVERNOR PINCHBACK AND MANY OTHERS
CAN PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH WE LABOURED DURING THE FIRST YEARS AT TUSKEGEE I RECALL THAT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I WOULD ROLL AND TOSS ON MY BED WITHOUT SLEEP
DOCTOR DONALD VENTURED THE REMARK THAT A LARGE CHAPEL AT TUSKEGEE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE THE NEXT DAY A LETTER CAME FROM TWO LADIES WHO WERE THEN TRAVELLING IN ITALY
WE WERE IN GREAT DISTRESS BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS AND THE NERVOUS STRAIN WAS TREMENDOUS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO THINK OF ANY SITUATION THAT IS MORE TRYING ON THE NERVES THAN THAT OF CONDUCTING A LARGE INSTITUTION
ALL THIS TENDED TO MAKE WASHINGTON AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COLOURED RACE
WITH WHICH TO RENEW THE BRICKMAKING EXPERIMENT I RETURNED TO TUSKEGEE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS RALLIED OUR RATHER DEMORALIZED AND DISCOURAGED FORCES AND BEGAN A FOURTH ATTEMPT TO MAKE BRICKS
AND WILL BE LIKE SLAVERY A SIN THAT AT SOME TIME WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR IN THE FALL OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AFTER HAVING TAUGHT SCHOOL IN MALDEN FOR TWO YEARS
AND HOW HE COULD TEACH THE CHILDREN CONCERNING THE SUBJECT HE EXPLAINED HIS POSITION IN THE MATTER BY SAYING THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO TEACH THAT THE EARTH WAS EITHER FLAT OR ROUND ACCORDING TO THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF HIS PATRONS
ROBERT C BEDFORD A WHITE MAN FROM WISCONSIN WHO WAS THEN PASTOR OF A LITTLE COLOURED
WE SHALL CONSTITUTE ONE THIRD AND MORE OF THE IGNORANCE AND CRIME OF THE SOUTH OR ONE THIRD ITS INTELLIGENCE AND PROGRESS WE SHALL CONTRIBUTE ONE THIRD TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY OF THE SOUTH OR WE SHALL PROVE A VERITABLE BODY OF DEATH STAGNATING DEPRESSING RETARDING EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE THE BODY POLITIC
WE BEGAN KEEPING HOUSE IN TUSKEGEE EARLY IN THE FALL THIS MADE A HOME FOR OUR TEACHERS WHO NOW HAD BEEN INCREASE TO FOUR IN NUMBER MY WIFE WAS ALSO A GRADUATE OF THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE
AND THEY NOT ONLY HELP TUSKEGEE BUT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP OTHER WORTHY CAUSES ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO BE THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH A GOOD MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
HE HAS SEEMED TO ME TO APPROACH AS NEARLY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE MASTER AS ALMOST ANY MAN I EVER MET A LITTLE LATER THERE CAME INTO THE SERVICE OF THE SCHOOL ANOTHER MAN QUITE YOUNG AT THE TIME AND FRESH FROM HAMPTON
AT THE REQUEST OF MYSELF AND OTHERS HE CONSENTED TO SPEND AN HOUR IN THE NEGRO BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTING THE NEGRO EXHIBIT AND OF GIVING THE COLOURED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AS SOON AS I MET MISTER CLEVELAND I BECAME IMPRESSED WITH HIS SIMPLICITY GREATNESS AND RUGGED HONESTY
IT CAN BE SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT THE SUPPLY OF MINISTERS WAS LARGE IN FACT SOME TIME AGO I KNEW A CERTAIN CHURCH THAT HAD A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN OF THAT NUMBER WERE MINISTERS
IN EVERY PART OF THE SOUTH DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD SCHOOLS BOTH DAY AND NIGHT WERE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS SOME BEING AS FAR ALONG IN AGE AS SIXTY AND SEVENTY YEARS
THAT WHILE THE INSTITUTION WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING SOME ONE TO PAY THE TUITION FOR THE STUDENTS THE MEN AND WOMEN THEMSELVES MUST PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN BOARD BOOKS CLOTHING AND ROOM WHOLLY BY WORK
YET I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY MAN IN THE COUNTRY WHO IS MORE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE HIGHEST WELFARE OF THE NEGRO THAN DOCTOR CURRY OR ONE WHO IS MORE FREE FROM RACE PREJUDICE
AND NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO GET MONEY FOR HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT I WOULD NEVER GET MORE THAN ENOUGH TO PAY MY TRAVELLING EXPENSES I THANKED HIM FOR HIS ADVICE
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE LAYING OF THIS CORNER STONE TOOK PLACE IN THE HEART OF THE SOUTH IN THE BLACK BELT IN THE CENTRE OF THAT PART OF OUR COUNTRY THAT WAS MOST DEVOTED TO SLAVERY
I RECEIVED SO MANY AND SUCH HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS THAT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING I DID NOT APPRECIATE TO ANY DEGREE HOWEVER THE IMPRESSION WHICH MY ADDRESS SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT INTO THE BUSINESS PART OF THE CITY
WHEN ALL THIS IS CONSIDERED THE SCENE THAT WAS WITNESSED ON THAT SPRING DAY AT TUSKEGEE WAS A REMARKABLE ONE I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED THROUGH THE MAILS VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN AWAY BY PERSONS WHO NEVER PERMIT THEIR NAMES TO BE KNOWN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD PERSONS CONDEMNED FOR NOT GIVING AWAY MONEY WHO
WHERE I SPENT NEARLY A HALF DAY IN LOOKING FOR A COLOURED FAMILY WITH WHOM I COULD BOARD NEVER DREAMING THAT ANY HOTEL WOULD ADMIT ME I WAS GREATLY SURPRISED
WERE STRONG UPRIGHT USEFUL MEN NEITHER WERE ALL THE CLASS DESIGNATED AS CARPETBAGGERS DISHONOURABLE MEN SOME OF THEM LIKE EX GOVERNOR BULLOCK OF GEORGIA WERE MEN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND USEFULNESS
THE MINISTRY WAS THE PROFESSION THAT SUFFERED MOST AND STILL SUFFERS THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF NOT ONLY IGNORANT BUT IN MANY CASES IMMORAL MEN WHO CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE
WE HAD A PLACE TO COOK AND EAT IN ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNCOMFORTABLE ANY ONE SEEING THE PLACE NOW WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONCE USED FOR A DINING ROOM THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM THOUGH
BEGGAR MY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT PERSISTENT ASKING OUTRIGHT FOR MONEY FROM THE RICH DOES NOT AS A RULE SECURE HELP
I KNEW THAT I WAS RIGHT AND THAT TIME AND THE SOBER SECOND THOUGHT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD VINDICATE ME IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE BISHOPS AND OTHER CHURCH LEADERS BEGAN TO MAKE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE MINISTRY AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS RIGHT
MISTER CAMPBELL SAID TO ME IN HIS FATHERLY WAY WASHINGTON ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT CREDIT IS CAPITAL AT ONE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE GREATEST DISTRESS FOR MONEY THAT WE EVER EXPERIENCED
THAN TO HAVE THAT POLITICAL STAGNATION WHICH ALWAYS RESULTS WHEN ONE HALF OF THE POPULATION HAS NO SHARE AND NO INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT THAT OURS WERE GOOD BRICKS THEY DISCOVERED THAT WE WERE SUPPLYING A REAL WANT IN THE COMMUNITY THE MAKING OF THESE BRICKS CAUSED MANY OF THE WHITE RESIDENTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BEGIN TO FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO
DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO SPEND A LARGE PROPORTION OF MY TIME AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION
I TOOK THE WATCH TO THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY WHICH WAS NOT FAR DISTANT AND PLACED IT IN A PAWN SHOP I SECURED CASH UPON IT TO THE AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS
I WOULD RECEIVE ONE OF THESE CALLS BUT FOR SOME REASON MY CALL NEVER CAME WHEN WE ADD THE NUMBER OF WHOLLY IGNORANT MEN WHO PREACHED OR EXHORTED TO THAT OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED SOMETHING OF AN EDUCATION
AT MY HOME IN WEST VIRGINIA THE PROCESS OF BEING CALLED TO THE MINISTRY WAS A VERY INTERESTING ONE USUALLY THE CALL CAME WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WAS SITTING IN CHURCH
FOR A DOZEN YEARS I MADE A STRONG EFFORT TO CONVINCE MISTER HUNTINGTON OF THE VALUE OF OUR WORK I NOTED THAT JUST IN PROPORTION AS THE USEFULNESS OF THE SCHOOL GREW HIS DONATIONS INCREASED
THIS TIME I AM GLAD TO SAY WE WERE SUCCESSFUL BEFORE I GOT HOLD OF ANY MONEY THE TIME LIMIT ON MY WATCH HAD EXPIRED AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT SINCE BUT I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THE LOSS OF IT
OR THE SALT HAD BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE BREAD OR THE TEA HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN EARLY ONE MORNING I WAS STANDING NEAR THE DINING ROOM DOOR LISTENING TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THE STUDENTS
AS AN ADDITIONAL RESULT HUNDREDS OF MEN ARE NOW SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WHO RECEIVED THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MECHANICS WHILE BEING TAUGHT HOW TO ERECT THESE BUILDINGS
BUT HE HAD RAISED TWO FINE HOGS AND THAT HE HAD BROUGHT ONE OF THEM AS A CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE EXPENSES OF THE BUILDING HE CLOSED HIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY SAYING ANY NIGGER THAT'S GOT ANY LOVE FOR HIS RACE OR ANY RESPECT FOR HIMSELF
THEN WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT AND IN POVERTY AMONG A LARGE CLASS THERE SEEMED TO BE A DEPENDENCE UPON THE GOVERNMENT FOR EVERY CONCEIVABLE THING THE MEMBERS OF THIS CLASS HAD LITTLE AMBITION TO CREATE A POSITION FOR THEMSELVES
MIGHT BECOME INTERESTED IN OUR EFFORTS AT TUSKEGEE IF OUR CONDITIONS AND NEEDS WERE PRESENTED TO HIM ON AN UNUSUALLY COLD AND STORMY DAY I WALKED THE TWO MILES TO SEE HIM AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY I SUCCEEDED IN SECURING AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
ALL THE INDUSTRIES AT TUSKEGEE HAVE BEEN STARTED IN NATURAL AND LOGICAL ORDER GROWING OUT OF THE NEEDS OF A COMMUNITY SETTLEMENT WE BEGAN WITH FARMING BECAUSE WE WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT
IN THAT CITY THE DONORS SEEM TO FEEL IN A LARGE DEGREE THAT AN HONOUR IS BEING CONFERRED UPON THEM IN THEIR BEING PERMITTED TO GIVE NOWHERE ELSE HAVE I MET WITH IN SO LARGE A MEASURE THIS FINE AND CHRISTLIKE SPIRIT
MISS DAVIDSON AND I BOTH WENT NORTH AND ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF RAISING FUNDS FOR THE COMPLETION OF OUR NEW BUILDING ON MY WAY NORTH I STOPPED IN NEW YORK TO TRY TO GET A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
WHILE PERFORMING THIS SERVICE TAUGHT THE LATEST AND BEST METHODS OF LABOUR SO THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD NOT ONLY GET THE BENEFIT OF THEIR EFFORTS BUT THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES WOULD BE TAUGHT TO SEE NOT ONLY UTILITY IN LABOUR BUT BEAUTY AND DIGNITY
AND A DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE INSTITUTION WAS VISITING THE SCHOOL HE WAS GIVEN A BEDROOM IMMEDIATELY OVER THE DINING ROOM EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS AWAKENED BY A RATHER ANIMATED DISCUSSION BETWEEN TWO BOYS IN THE DINING ROOM BELOW
THE EFFORT TO SECURE THIS INCREASE WAS LED BY THE HON M F FOSTER THE MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM TUSKEGEE SECOND WE RECEIVED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE JOHN F SLATER FUND
IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL I THINK TO START OFF ON A FOUNDATION WHICH ONE HAS MADE FOR ONE'S SELF WHEN OUR OLD STUDENTS RETURN TO TUSKEGEE NOW AS THEY OFTEN DO
AS I REMEMBER IT NOW THE THING THAT WAS UPPERMOST IN MY MIND WAS THE DESIRE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE RACES AND BRING ABOUT HEARTY COOPERATION BETWEEN THEM
I NOTICED THAT THE VERY FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN ASKING TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF THE LAND MADE THEM BEGIN TO FEEL AS IF IT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR SCHOOL TO A LARGE DEGREE
BUILDED YOUR RAILROADS AND CITIES AND BROUGHT FORTH TREASURES FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AND HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE THIS MAGNIFICENT REPRESENTATION OF THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUTH CASTING DOWN YOUR BUCKET AMONG MY PEOPLE HELPING AND ENCOURAGING THEM AS YOU ARE DOING ON THESE GROUNDS
AND UP TO THE PRESENT TIME WE HAVE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE HELP FROM THEM FIRST THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA INCREASED ITS ANNUAL APPROPRIATION FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF MISTER BEDFORD HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ME HE GLADLY CONSENTED TO COME TO TUSKEGEE AND HOLD THE THANKSGIVING SERVICE IT WAS THE FIRST SERVICE OF THE KIND THAT THE COLOURED PEOPLE THERE HAD EVER OBSERVED
SUCH BUSINESS METHODS AS WOULD BE APPROVED OF BY ANY NEW YORK BANKING HOUSE I HAVE SPOKEN OF SEVERAL LARGE GIFTS TO THE SCHOOL BUT BY FAR THE GREATER PROPORTION OF THE MONEY THAT HAS BUILT UP THE INSTITUTION
WHEN SHE REACHED THE WELL SHE FOUND THAT THE ROPE WAS BROKEN AND THAT SHE COULD GET NO WATER SHE TURNED FROM THE WELL AND SAID IN THE MOST DISCOURAGED TONE NOT KNOWING THAT I WAS WHERE I COULD HEAR HER
IMPRESSED ME AT THE TIME AS BEING A MAN OF ALL OTHERS TO BE ENVIED
THE MAKING OF THESE BRICKS TAUGHT ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO RACES IN THE SOUTH MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAD HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE SCHOOL AND PERHAPS NO SYMPATHY WITH IT CAME TO US TO BUY BRICKS
AND WENT TO HAMPTON IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVING THERE I FOUND THAT THE GENERAL HAD DECIDED TO TAKE A QUARTETTE OF SINGERS THROUGH THE NORTH AND HOLD MEETINGS FOR A MONTH IN IMPORTANT CITIES AT WHICH MEETINGS HE AND I WERE TO SPEAK
OR PARTLY BY WORK AND PARTLY IN CASH AT THE INSTITUTION AT WHICH I NOW WAS I FOUND THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THE STUDENTS BY SOME MEANS HAD THEIR PERSONAL EXPENSES PAID FOR THEM
EXCEPT THAT THE PEOPLE HAD CEASED WORK IN THE FIELDS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THEIR HOMES AT NIGHT DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK THEY USUALLY HAD WHAT THEY CALLED A FROLIC IN SOME CABIN ON THE PLANTATION THAT MEANT A KIND OF ROUGH DANCE
WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HER HUSBAND CAME IN AND ASKED ME IN THE MOST ABRUPT MANNER WHAT I WANTED WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE OBJECT OF MY CALL HE BECAME STILL MORE UNGENTLEMANLY IN HIS WORDS AND MANNER
BRICKMAKING HAS NOW BECOME SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY AT THE SCHOOL THAT LAST SEASON OUR STUDENTS MANUFACTURED TWELVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF FIRST CLASS BRICKS
GIFTS FROM OUR FRIENDS BUT WE HAVE NO SUITABLE PLACE FOR THEM AND WE HAVE NO SUITABLE READING ROOM OUR GRADUATES GO TO WORK IN EVERY SECTION OF THE SOUTH
BEFORE THE BUILDING WAS COMPLETED WE PASSED THROUGH SOME VERY TRYING SEASONS MORE THAN ONCE OUR HEARTS WERE MADE TO BLEED AS IT WERE BECAUSE BILLS WERE FALLING DUE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO MEET
AND WITH THE DEMAND WILL COME THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE IT AND TO PROFIT BY IT ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE SUCCEEDED IN BURNING OUR FIRST KILN OF BRICKS WE BEGAN FACING IN AN EMPHASIZED FORM THE OBJECTION
WHILE DOING THIS YOU CAN BE SURE IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES WILL BE SURROUNDED BY THE MOST PATIENT FAITHFUL LAW ABIDING AND UNRESENTFUL PEOPLE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN
THEY WANTED MORE COSTLY DRESSES MORE COSTLY HATS AND SHOES IN A WORD WHILE THEIR WANTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPLY THEIR WANTS HAD NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THE SAME DEGREE ON THE OTHER HAND
OF THE GREEK AND LATIN LANGUAGES WOULD MAKE ONE A VERY SUPERIOR HUMAN BEING SOMETHING BORDERING ALMOST ON THE SUPERNATURAL I REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST COLOURED MAN WHOM I SAW WHO KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT FOREIGN LANGUAGES
THAT MEALS MUST BE SERVED AT CERTAIN FIXED AND REGULAR HOURS AND THIS WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT WORRY EVERYTHING WAS SO OUT OF JOINT AND SO INCONVENIENT THAT I FEEL SAFE IN SAYING THAT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
AND THAT OUR WORK WOULD MEAN LITTLE UNLESS WE COULD GET HOLD OF THE STUDENTS IN THEIR HOME LIFE ONE INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ABOUT THIS TIME GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION AS WELL AS SURPRISE
I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IF SOME PLAN COULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN OPERATION WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE POSSESSION OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EDUCATION OR PROPERTY OR BOTH A TEST FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE FRANCHISE
THE EFFORT TO SECURE HELP FROM THE SLATER AND PEABODY FUNDS BROUGHT ME INTO CONTACT WITH TWO RARE MEN MEN WHO HAVE HAD MUCH TO DO IN SHAPING THE POLICY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO
SHE WOULD BE SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE COULD NOT UNDRESS HERSELF A LADY UPON WHOM SHE CALLED IN BOSTON AFTERWARD TOLD ME THAT AT ONE TIME WHEN MISS DAVIDSON CALLED HER TO SEE AND SEND UP HER CARD
HAVE ACCUMULATED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY BUT WHO AT THE SAME TIME WOULD NEVER THINK OF GOING TO THOSE SAME PERSONS FOR ADVICE CONCERNING THE CASTING OF THEIR BALLOTS THIS IT SEEMS TO ME IS UNWISE AND UNREASONABLE AND SHOULD CEASE
IN OTHER HOMES SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BOUGHT A NEW PISTOL IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN IN THE CABIN TO REMIND ONE OF THE COMING OF THE SAVIOUR
IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE RAIN CEASED AND DOCTOR DONALD FINISHED HIS SERMON AND AN EXCELLENT SERMON IT WAS TOO IN SPITE OF THE WEATHER AFTER HE HAD GONE TO HIS ROOM AND HAD GOTTEN THE WET THREADS OF HIS CLOTHES DRY
AND THE STUDENTS WOULD USE THE MONEY PAID TO THEM TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN SCHOOL
ARE THOSE WHO NEVER GROW EXCITED OR LOSE SELF CONTROL BUT ARE ALWAYS CALM SELF POSSESSED PATIENT AND POLITE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT WILLIAM MC KINLEY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A MAN OF THIS CLASS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
THIS IN A LARGE MEASURE HELPED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PLEASANT RELATIONS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO EXIST BETWEEN US AND THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THAT SECTION AND WHICH NOW EXTEND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
TWO YEARS LATER WHEN THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE HAD GROWN CONSIDERABLY AND WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A SEASON WHEN WE WERE SO MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY THAT THE FUTURE LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND GLOOMY THE SAME TWO BOSTON LADIES SENT US SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
ASKING FOR CHRIS'MUS GIFTS CHRIS'MUS GIFTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TWO O'CLOCK AND FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I PRESUME THAT WE MUST HAVE HAD A HALF HUNDRED SUCH CALLS
PARTICULARLY IN THE BURNING OF THE BRICKS AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF EFFORT WE MOULDED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BRICKS AND PUT THEM INTO A KILN TO BE BURNED THIS KILN TURNED OUT TO BE A FAILURE
I TALKED TO THE STUDENTS CONSTANTLY ON THE SUBJECT NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNPOPULARITY OF INDUSTRIAL WORK THE SCHOOL CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND YEAR
IN CONCLUSION MAY I REPEAT THAT NOTHING IN THIRTY YEARS HAS GIVEN US MORE HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT
THE LADY WAS DETAINED A LITTLE BEFORE SHE COULD SEE MISS DAVIDSON AND WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR SHE FOUND MISS DAVIDSON SO EXHAUSTED THAT SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WHILE PUTTING UP OUR FIRST BUILDING
I RECALL WITH PLEASURE YOUR VISIT TO ME TWO YEARS AGO I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE ANY OCCURRENCE WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN ME MORE GENUINE SATISFACTION THAN THE RECEIPT OF THIS DRAFT
THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL THE ONE THING THAT IS MOST WORTH LIVING FOR AND DYING FOR IF NEED BE IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME ONE ELSE MORE HAPPY AND MORE USEFUL
SO THAT WE COULD OCCUPY A PORTION OF IT WHICH WAS NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND YEAR OF THE SCHOOL WE OPENED A BOARDING DEPARTMENT STUDENTS HAD BEGUN COMING FROM QUITE A DISTANCE AND IN SUCH INCREASING NUMBERS THAT WE FELT MORE AND MORE
I APPLIED TO THE WHITE MEN OF TUSKEGEE FOR SMALL LOANS OFTEN BORROWING SMALL AMOUNTS FROM AS MANY AS A HALF DOZEN PERSONS TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS
SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE THE COMMUNITY FEEL THAT IN A DEGREE IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AND PERHAPS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DEPENDENT UPON HIM IN THIS WAY PLEASANT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RACES HAVE BEEN SIMULATED
NOT ONLY THIS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AFFORDED WILL AWAKEN AMONG US A NEW ERA OF INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS IGNORANT AND INEXPERIENCED IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT IN THE FIRST YEARS OF OUR NEW LIFE WE BEGAN AT THE TOP INSTEAD OF AT THE BOTTOM
AND IN THIS MAIL THERE WAS A CHECK SENT BY MISS DAVIDSON FOR EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS I COULD RELATE MANY INSTANCES OF ALMOST THE SAME CHARACTER THIS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS GIVEN BY TWO LADIES IN BOSTON
WAS IN A LARGE MEASURE ON A FALSE FOUNDATION WAS ARTIFICIAL AND FORCED IN MANY CASES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE IGNORANCE OF MY RACE WAS BEING USED AS A TOOL
WILL BRING A HOG TO THE NEXT MEETING QUITE A NUMBER OF MEN IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO VOLUNTEERED TO GIVE SEVERAL DAYS WORK EACH TOWARD THE ERECTION OF THE BUILDING AFTER WE HAD SECURED ALL THE HELP THAT WE COULD IN TUSKEGEE
SOMETHING OCCURRED WHICH SHOWED THE GREATNESS OF GENERAL ARMSTRONG SOMETHING WHICH PROVED HOW FAR HE WAS ABOVE THE ORDINARY INDIVIDUAL WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF GREAT ANXIETY AS TO WHERE AND HOW WE WERE TO GET FUNDS FOR THE NEW BUILDING
I HAD GIVEN ONE OF OUR CREDITORS A PROMISE THAT UPON A CERTAIN DAY HE SHOULD BE PAID FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY WE DID NOT HAVE A DOLLAR THE MAIL ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL AT TEN O'CLOCK
AND THE WHOLE THING OCCUPIED A SPACE ABOUT FIVE BY TWELVE FEET IT REQUIRED TEN YEARS OF WORK BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO SECURE MISTER CARNEGIE'S INTEREST AND HELP THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM TEN YEARS AGO HE SEEMED TO TAKE BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL
THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE LIVES AND WORKS ARE GOING TO THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY PART WITH SUCH A MAN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN DO SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD WANTS DONE WILL IN THE END MAKE HIS WAY REGARDLESS OF RACE
WAS TO GET THE BOARDING DEPARTMENT STARTED OFF IN RUNNING ORDER WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH IN THE WAY OF FURNITURE AND WITH NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY ANYTHING THE MERCHANTS IN THE TOWN WOULD LET US HAVE WHAT FOOD WE WANTED ON CREDIT
ONE LECTURE BUREAU OFFERED ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT AND EXPENSES IF I WOULD PLACE MY SERVICES AT ITS DISPOSAL FOR A GIVEN PERIOD
BUT IT IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE BE PREPARED FOR THE EXERCISES OF THESE PRIVILEGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A DOLLAR IN A FACTORY JUST NOW IS WORTH INFINITELY MORE THAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND A DOLLAR IN AN OPERA HOUSE
WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ANY LACK OF COMFORT OR FINE FINISH I FURTHER TOLD THOSE WHO DOUBTED THE WISDOM OF THIS PLAN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS CAME TO US IN POVERTY FROM THE CABINS OF THE COTTON SUGAR
I AM GLAD THAT OUR STUDENTS HAD TO DIG OUT THE PLACE FOR THEIR KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM I AM GLAD THAT OUR FIRST BOARDING PLACE WAS IN THE DISMAL ILL LIGHTED AND DAMP BASEMENT HAD WE STARTED IN A FINE ATTRACTIVE CONVENIENT ROOM
OF PERFECTING THEMSELVES IN THE INDUSTRIES AT THEIR DOORS AND IN SECURING PROPERTY THE TEMPTATIONS TO ENTER POLITICAL LIFE WERE SO ALLURING THAT I CAME VERY NEAR YIELDING TO THEM AT ONE TIME
I HAVE ADVISED OUR PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH TO MAKE FRIENDS IN EVERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MANLY WAY WITH THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR WHETHER HE BE A BLACK MAN OR A WHITE MAN I HAVE ALSO ADVISED THEM WHERE NO PRINCIPLE IS AT STAKE
ERECTED BY THE LABOUR OF THE STUDENTS BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO STICK TO IT
I HAD THE FEELING THAT MISTAKES WERE BEING MADE AND THAT THINGS COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CONDITION THAT THEY WERE IN THEN VERY LONG I FELT THAT THE RECONSTRUCTION POLICY SO FAR AS IT RELATED TO MY RACE
WITH HEAVY OBLIGATIONS TO MEET WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE MONEY IS TO COME FROM TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM MONTH TO MONTH IN OUR CASE I FELT A DOUBLE RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS MADE THE ANXIETY ALL THE MORE INTENSE
AS FOR DISHES THERE WERE TOO FEW TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO SPEND TIME IN DESCRIBING THEM
THE OTHER HELP TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED CAME IN THE SHAPE OF AN ALLOWANCE FROM THE PEABODY FUND THIS WAS AT FIRST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT IT HAS SINCE BEEN INCREASED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
HAD BEEN GOTTEN FROM THE WHITE AND COLOURED PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE THE MOST OF THIS MONEY WAS OBTAINED BY HOLDING FESTIVALS AND CONCERTS AND FROM SMALL INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS
OR SO COMPLETE IN THEIR FINISH AS BUILDINGS ERECTED BY THE EXPERIENCED HANDS OF OUTSIDE WORKMEN BUT THAT IN THE TEACHING OF CIVILIZATION SELF HELP AND SELF RELIANCE THE ERECTION OF BUILDINGS BY THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES
STATUARY CARVING PAINTINGS THE MANAGEMENT OF DRUG STORES AND BANKS HAS NOT BEEN TRODDEN WITHOUT CONTACT WITH THORNS AND THISTLES WHILE WE TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE EXHIBIT AS A RESULT OF OUR INDEPENDENT EFFORTS WE DO NOT FOR A MOMENT FORGET THAT OUR PART IN THIS EXHIBITION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS
IS TO DO MY FULL DUTY IN REGARD TO GIVING PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HELP IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE TUSKEGEE SCHOOL I WALKED THE STREETS OR TRAVELLED COUNTRY ROADS IN THE NORTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS WITHOUT RECEIVING A DOLLAR
I PLACED THE SITUATION FRANKLY BEFORE GENERAL ARMSTRONG WITHOUT HESITATION HE GAVE ME HIS PERSONAL CHECK FOR ALL THE MONEY WHICH HE HAD SAVED FOR HIS OWN USE
FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HURRY UP AND BRING UP SOME MORE BRICKS SEVERAL TIMES I HEARD THE COMMAND HURRY UP GOVERNOR HURRY UP GOVERNOR MY CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED TO SUCH AN EXTENT
CHAPTER FIVE THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD THE YEARS FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
MADE TREMENDOUS MISTAKES JUST AS MANY PEOPLE SIMILARLY SITUATED WOULD HAVE DONE MANY OF THE SOUTHERN WHITES HAVE A FEELING THAT IF THE NEGRO IS PERMITTED TO EXERCISE HIS POLITICAL RIGHTS NOW TO ANY DEGREE
VERY SOON THE PROBLEM OF PROVIDING MORE ROOMS FOR THE GIRLS AS WELL AS A LARGER BOARDING DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE STUDENTS GREW SERIOUS AS A RESULT WE FINALLY DECIDED TO UNDERTAKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STILL LARGER BUILDING
AS I LOOK BACK NOW OVER THAT PART OF OUR STRUGGLE I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT WE HAD IT I AM GLAD THAT WE ENDURED ALL THOSE DISCOMFORTS AND INCONVENIENCES
TO REPAIR HER SELF RESPECT SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING THAT LORD WARBURTON HAD LET HER KNOW THAT THERE WAS A DANGER BUT SHE DIDN'T SHE ONLY SAID IN HER EMBARRASSMENT RATHER WIDE OF THE MARK THAT HE SURELY HAD BEEN MOST KIND MOST FRIENDLY
AFTER THIS SHE THOUGHT EXCEPT OF HER JOURNEY ONLY OF ONE THING SHE MUST GO AND SEE PANSY FROM HER SHE COULDN'T TURN AWAY
BUT THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT HER VERY HARD THEN HE GENTLY PLACED RALPH'S HAND IN A PROPER POSITION CLOSE BESIDE HIM THE NURSE LOOKED AT HER VERY HARD TOO AND NO ONE SAID A WORD BUT ISABEL ONLY LOOKED AT WHAT SHE HAD COME TO SEE
HE WANTED TO DO NOTHING BUT SAIL ON THE BIG BOATS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TOGETHER FROM NEW YORK TO MILWAUKEE STOPPING AT THE MOST INTERESTING CITIES ON THE ROUTE
HOW CAN YOU PRETEND YOU'RE NOT HEART BROKEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN IT'S TOO LATE TO PLAY A PART DIDN'T YOU LEAVE ALL THAT BEHIND YOU IN ROME TOUCHETT KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND I KNEW IT TOO
AND THEN SHE ADDED WITH A TRIUMPH OF SELF CONTROL I THINK PAPA'S RIGHT I'VE BEEN SO MUCH IN THE WORLD THIS WINTER HER ANNOUNCEMENT HAD A STRANGE EFFECT ON ISABEL IT SEEMED TO CARRY A LARGER MEANING THAN THE GIRL HERSELF KNEW
HEAR HER SAY THAT SHE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR LORD WARBURTON'S DEFECTION RALPH WAS CERTAIN THAT THIS WAS HER SITUATION HE KNEW BY INSTINCT IN ADVANCE THE FORM THAT IN SUCH AN EVENT OSMOND'S DISPLEASURE WOULD TAKE
TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED THAT FEAT WITHOUT THE LEAST SUCCESS YOU THINK OF THOSE WHO THINK OF YOU SHE SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE I KNOW MISTER ROSIER THINKS OF ME HE OUGHT NOT TO SAID ISABEL LOFTILY
SAVE OF COURSE HIS INTRINSIC QUALITIES OH HE WAS INTRINSIC ENOUGH SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS EVEN LOOKING FOR ARTIFICIAL AIDS IF HE EXTENDED HIS BUSINESS THAT
SHE MADE HER WAY DOWN TO ROME WITHOUT TOUCHING AT FLORENCE
DURING WHICH THE FACT OF HER BEING WITH HIS OLD FRIEND MADAME MERLE IN WHOSE HOUSE SHE HAD GONE TO LODGE MADE IT VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER EVERY DAY WHEN THE LAST OF APRIL CAME
YES BUT YOU CAN COME AND SEE ME THOUGH YOU'VE NOT COME VERY OFTEN I'VE NOT COME BECAUSE YOUR FATHER FORBADE IT TO DAY I BRING NOTHING WITH ME I CAN'T AMUSE YOU I'M NOT TO BE AMUSED
BUT FELT LIKE SHE KNEW NOT WHAT
I WON'T GO IN SAID THE GOOD SISTER MADAME MERLE'S WAITING FOR YOU AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ISABEL STIFFENED SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING IF THERE WERE NO OTHER EGRESS FROM THE CONVENT
WITH THE MANNERS OF THE PRESENT TIME SHE IS LIABLE TO BECOME SO DUSTY AND CRUMPLED PANSY'S A LITTLE DUSTY A LITTLE DISHEVELLED SHE HAS KNOCKED ABOUT TOO MUCH THIS BUSTLING PUSHING RABBLE THAT CALLS ITSELF SOCIETY
NO IT'S MY OWN PROPOSAL I THINK I HAD BETTER WAIT THEN DID PAPA SEND ME NO MESSAGE I DON'T THINK HE KNEW I WAS COMING
DOES HE MEAN HER FOLLOWING HIM UP FROM ROME WAS THAT A SERVICE TO LITERATURE IT CONTAINS A GREAT MANY RARE AND VALUABLE BOOKS AND AS SHE CAN'T CARRY IT ABOUT THE WORLD IN HER TRUNK HE RECOMMENDS HER TO SELL IT AT AUCTION
BUT IN A TONE OF RIPE REFLECTION WHICH DEPRIVED THE REMARK OF ALL BRUTAL ABRUPTNESS IT'S AS IF YOU HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO PICK OUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT I HAVE LEAST IN COMMON WITH YOUR COUSIN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT A CONCEITED ASS
SHE HAD WANTED HELP AND HERE WAS HELP IT HAD COME IN A RUSHING TORRENT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE BELIEVED EVERYTHING HE SAID BUT SHE BELIEVED JUST THEN THAT TO LET HIM TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST THING TO HER DYING THIS BELIEF FOR A MOMENT
NO MATTER I CAME FROM LONDON A WHILE AGO BY THE TRAIN BUT I COULDN'T COME HERE DIRECTLY THERE WAS A MAN AT THE STATION WHO GOT AHEAD OF ME HE TOOK A FLY THAT WAS THERE AND I HEARD HIM GIVE THE ORDER TO DRIVE HERE
ISABEL SUDDENLY GOT UP YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT ME WHY NOT WHY NOT WHEN WE TALKED IN THAT WAY HE DEMANDED FOLLOWING HER FAST AND HE WAS DYING
AND SHE ANNOUNCED IN THE SERENEST SIMPLEST TONE THAT THOUGH SHE MIGHT NEVER MARRY MISTER ROSIER SHE WOULD NEVER CEASE TO THINK OF HIM SHE APPEARED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE IDEA OF ETERNAL SINGLENESS
AN APPLIED HANDLED HUNG UP TOOL AS SENSELESS AND CONVENIENT
SHE HAS SO MUCH TASTE OF COURSE IT'S ALL NONE OF MY BUSINESS BUT I FEEL HAPPIER SINCE I'VE SEEN HER SHE MAY EVEN HAVE A MAID IF SHE LIKES BUT OF COURSE SHE HAS NO OCCASION TO DRESS SHE WEARS A LITTLE BLACK FROCK
I'M VERY SURE OF THAT NOTHING CAN BE MORE HONOURABLE THAN FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE POOR CHILD ALONE SHE CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON AND IT'S CRUEL TO ATTEMPT TO BRIBE HER BY MAGNIFICENT OFFERS TO GIVE HIM UP
AND HENRIETTA WAS CHEERED ON HER WAY BY A PROMISE FROM MISTER BANTLING THAT HE WOULD SOON COME OVER
RALPH LOOKED AT HER AS IF HIS MILD HILARITY HAD BEEN TOUCHED WITH MYSTIFICATION YOU SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED ISABEL GOT UP SLOWLY SMOOTHING HER GLOVES AND EYEING THEM THOUGHTFULLY IT'S AFTER ALL NO BUSINESS OF MINE
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE ISABEL CAME BACK TO FLORENCE BUT ONLY AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AN INTERVAL SUFFICIENTLY REPLETE WITH INCIDENT IT IS NOT HOWEVER DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT WE ARE CLOSELY CONCERNED WITH HER
REMARKING THAT THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER HIS LETTERS SHE WOULD PERHAPS NOT WHOLLY CLOSE HER EARS TO HIS SPOKEN ELOQUENCE SHE REPLIED THAT HER STEPDAUGHTER WAS CLOSE AT HAND
SHE SAID IT AT RANDOM TO HEAR HERSELF SAY SOMETHING BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT SHE MEANT THE WORLD IN TRUTH HAD NEVER SEEMED SO LARGE IT SEEMED TO OPEN OUT ALL ROUND HER TO TAKE THE FORM OF A MIGHTY SEA WHERE SHE FLOATED IN FATHOMLESS WATERS
TO COMPLETE THE METAPHOR HAD GIVEN THE LIGHTER VESSEL A STRAIN WHICH STILL OCCASIONALLY BETRAYED ITSELF IN A FAINT CREAKING IT HAD BEEN HORRID TO SEE HIM
BUT SHE HAD NEVER GUESSED SO HAPPILY AS THAT ISABEL'S SATISFACTIONS JUST NOW WERE FEW BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN MORE NUMEROUS
HAD ONLY BEEN THE DESIRE TO LEAVE HER AT LIBERTY PANSY BENT FORWARD RAISED HER FACE NEARER AND NEARER AND WITH A LITTLE MURMUR WHICH EVIDENTLY EXPRESSED A DEEP LONGING ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD GREATLY WISHED HER TO SPEAK AND THAT SHE BEGGED HER TO ADVISE HER NOW
AND YET SHE WISHED TO MAKE HER PEACE WITH THE WORLD TO PUT HER SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER IT CAME BACK TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THERE WAS AN ACCOUNT STILL TO BE SETTLED WITH CASPAR AND SHE SAW HERSELF DISPOSED
BUT FOR PANSY EVIDENTLY IT FAILED TO LEAD IN THAT DIRECTION SHE FELT NO BITTERNESS TOWARD HER FATHER THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN HER HEART THERE WAS ONLY THE SWEETNESS OF FIDELITY TO EDWARD ROSIER
AT BOTTOM IT'S HIM YOU'VE TO THANK SHE STOPPED THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ISABEL'S EYES I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU IT WAS MY UNCLE'S MONEY YES IT WAS YOUR UNCLE'S MONEY
HE MUST LOOK OUT FOR A PIANO NOBILE AND HE GOES AWAY AFTER HAVING GOT A MONTH'S LODGING IN THE POOR LITTLE APARTMENT FOR NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE HOWEVER IS YOUR MOST WONDERFUL INVENTION SHE STRIKES ME AS A KIND OF MONSTER
SO THOUGHT ISABEL ARE THE GREAT PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS MADAME CATHERINE GENTLY PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF PANSY'S ROOM AND USHERED IN THE VISITOR THEN STOOD SMILING WITH FOLDED HANDS
AND IT WAS OF NO USE THAT WHEN CATCHING HERSELF IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE CALLED HERSELF A FEEBLE SPIRIT A COWARD IT WAS NOT THAT SHE LOVED RALPH LESS BUT THAT ALMOST ANYTHING SEEMED PREFERABLE TO REPUDIATING THE MOST SERIOUS ACT
HE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING HE GUESSED MY SENTIMENTS HE WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY AND HE LEFT YOU SO LONG AS YOU SHOULD BE IN ENGLAND TO MY CARE SAID GOODWOOD AS IF HE WERE MAKING A GREAT POINT
AND NO ESTEEM FOR THEM A COTTON FACTORY WAS NOT A COMPENSATION FOR ANYTHING LEAST OF ALL FOR HAVING FAILED TO MARRY ISABEL ARCHER AND YET BEYOND THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE HAD
AS IT IS YOU'VE NOTHING TO CONSIDER YOU MUST SAVE WHAT YOU CAN OF YOUR LIFE YOU MUSTN'T LOSE IT ALL SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'VE LOST A PART IT WOULD BE AN INSULT TO YOU TO ASSUME THAT YOU CARE FOR THE LOOK OF THE THING FOR WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER WITHOUT MEETING HER EYES AND THEN HE TURNED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT WHO HAD WANDERED BACK TO THEM WITH HER HIS PARTING WAS EQUALLY BRIEF AND IN A MOMENT THE TWO LADIES SAW HIM MOVE WITH LONG STEPS ACROSS THE LAWN
WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH THEN SHE SAID IT WAS HER ONLY REVENGE I BELIEVED IT WAS YOU I HAD TO THANK MADAME MERLE DROPPED HER EYES
EACH AGGRESSIVE FACT OF HIS FACE HIS FIGURE HIS PRESENCE JUSTIFIED OF ITS INTENSE IDENTITY AND MADE ONE WITH THIS ACT OF POSSESSION SO HAD SHE HEARD OF THOSE WRECKED AND UNDER WATER
AND AS ISABEL ANSWERED NOTHING SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY I DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE ISABEL HESITATED THEN STOPPED YOU MUST NEVER SAY THAT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE PANSY LOOKED AT HER IN WONDER
IT COULD ONLY TAKE THE MEANEST AND CRUELLEST HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WARN ISABEL OF IT TO LET HER SEE AT LEAST HOW HE JUDGED FOR HER AND HOW HE KNEW IT LITTLE MATTERED THAT ISABEL WOULD KNOW MUCH BETTER
FORTUNATELY HOWEVER HE HAS NOT SAID A WORD TO DISTURB HER HE COULD COME AND BID HER GOOD BYE TO MORROW WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY HOW WOULD YOUR HUSBAND LIKE THAT NOT AT ALL AND HE MAY BE RIGHT IN NOT LIKING IT
IT DOESN'T MATTER DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT THAT'S WHY I HAD NOT SPOKEN OF IT I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD ENTER INTO IT BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE IDEA
PANSY HAD A SUFFICIENT ILLUMINATION OF HER OWN AND ISABEL FELT THAT SHE HERSELF JUST NOW HAD NO LIGHT TO SPARE FROM HER SMALL STOCK NEVERTHELESS IT STILL CLUNG TO HER THAT SHE MUST BE LOYAL TO OSMOND THAT SHE WAS ON HER HONOUR IN DEALING WITH HIS DAUGHTER
MADAME MERLE RAISED HER EYES I SHALL GO TO AMERICA
SO THAT HE MIGHT APPEAR TO SUFFER FOR GOOD MANNERS SAKE HER IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS OBJECTIONS PUT HIM TOO MUCH IN THE WRONG IT BEING IN EFFECT ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF EXPRESSING CONTEMPT
BUT SHE HAD PUT IT ON AGAIN TO RALPH'S INFINITE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER NATURAL FACE AND HE WISHED IMMENSELY TO LOOK INTO IT
ISABEL HAD A DIFFICULT TASK THE ONLY THING WAS TO PERFORM IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE SHE FELT BITTER AND ANGRY BUT SHE WARNED HERSELF AGAINST BETRAYING THIS HEAT SHE WAS AFRAID EVEN OF LOOKING TOO GRAVE OR AT LEAST TOO STERN SHE WAS AFRAID OF CAUSING ALARM
GILBERT OSMOND SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN COMFORT IN MISS STACKPOLE HIS INSTINCT HAD NATURALLY SET HIM IN OPPOSITION TO A YOUNG LADY CAPABLE OF ADVISING HIS WIFE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE CONJUGAL ROOF WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN ROME
AND THAT WOULDN'T BE EASY THE PROSPECT MADE HER HEART BEAT AND HER CHEEKS BURN AS I SAY IN ADVANCE THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IN HER WISH TO AVOID AN OPEN RUPTURE SHE FOUND HERSELF WISHING RALPH WOULD START EVEN AT A RISK
THAT PARTICULAR REFLECTION THOUGH SHE INDULGED IN SO MANY HAD NOT HAD THE ASSURANCE TO PRESENT ITSELF BUT ON FINDING HERSELF IN TROUBLE HE HAD BECOME A MEMBER OF THAT CIRCLE OF THINGS
THE CONSCIOUS STREAM OF HER PERFECT MANNER GATHERED ITSELF AGAIN AND FLOWED ON AS SMOOTHLY AS MIGHT BE TO THE END BUT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD THE END IN VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO PROCEED
SHE HATED TO HEAR HERSELF SAY IT SHE TRIED TO SAY IT AS JUDICIALLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT DOES HE DO TO YOU HENRIETTA ASKED FROWNING AS IF SHE WERE ENQUIRING INTO THE OPERATIONS OF A QUACK DOCTOR
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ECONOMICAL HABITS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP SAND WHICH SHE WAS NOW MORE CAREFUL THAN EVER TO OBSERVE SO THAT THE ROOM WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A COUPLE OF LOGS THE ROOMS IN PALAZZO ROCCANERA WERE AS SPACIOUS AS THEY WERE NUMEROUS
SHE USED TO BE VERY KIND TO ME BUT SHE HAS CHANGED OTHERS TOO HAVE CHANGED
AND SHE WENT ON WITHOUT A MURMUR WITHOUT FALTERING OR GLANCING BACK ISABEL HOWEVER ALLOWING HERSELF THIS LAST LIBERTY
ISABEL RECOGNISED MADAME CATHERINE WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY MADE AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY LET HER SEE MISS OSMOND MADAME CATHERINE LOOKED DOUBLY DISCREET BUT SMILED VERY BLANDLY AND SAID
FOR ISABEL AND PANSY TOOK THEIR PLACES AGAIN IN THE CARRIAGE PANSY WHO FACED HER STEPMOTHER AT FIRST KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER LAP THEN SHE RAISED THEM AND RESTED THEM ON ISABEL'S THERE SHONE OUT OF EACH OF THEM A LITTLE MELANCHOLY RAY
THAT'S NOT WHAT PAPA WISHES THEN IT HARDLY MATTERS WHETHER I'M IN ROME OR IN ENGLAND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY MISSUS OSMOND SAID PANSY NOT VERY BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
HE MADE ME MADAME MERLE APPEARING TO SEE HERSELF SUCCESSFUL SHE WENT ON MORE TRIUMPHANTLY HE IMPARTED TO YOU THAT EXTRA LUSTRE WHICH WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE YOU A BRILLIANT MATCH
THE ONE I SHOULD HAVE LIKED BEST TO LIVE IN I DON'T VENTURE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE MADAME MERLE ADDED BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY LOVE TO THE PLACE ISABEL TURNED AWAY I HAD BETTER GO TO PANSY
AND A STRANGE EXQUISITE INTIMATION THAT SHE COULD PROVE IT BETTER BY REMAINING SINGLE THAN EVEN BY MARRYING HIM YOUR FATHER WOULD LIKE YOU TO MAKE A BETTER MARRIAGE SAID ISABEL MISTER ROSIER'S FORTUNE IS NOT AT ALL LARGE
DO KINDLY LET THEM SEE YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE ENGLAND IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE I HAVE SUCH A FRIENDLY RECOLLECTION OF THEM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD COME TO LOCKLEIGH FOR A DAY OR TWO YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THAT OLD PROMISE
YOU'RE VERY PHILOSOPHIC SAID HER COUSIN AND THEN IN A MOMENT MAY I ENQUIRE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ISABEL STARED I THOUGHT YOU KNEW LORD WARBURTON TELLS ME HE WANTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MARRY PANSY
BUT IT SCARCELY MATTERED FOR HE ONLY FAILED WHAT HAD SHE COME FOR THEN AND WHY DID SHE SEEM ALMOST TO OFFER HIM A CHANCE TO VIOLATE THEIR TACIT CONVENTION WHY DID SHE ASK HIM HIS ADVICE IF SHE GAVE HIM NO LIBERTY TO ANSWER HER
JUST BEFORE WAS THE ONLY THING HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER YOU'LL BE DECIDEDLY AT VARIANCE ALL THE SAME HE SAID IN A MOMENT AND AS SHE ANSWERED NOTHING LOOKING AS IF SHE SCARCE UNDERSTOOD
OF HANDWRITINGS OF PROFANED RELICS OF GRIM THINGS PRODUCED IN COURT IT MADE ISABEL FEEL FAINT IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO SPEAK ON THE SPOT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNABLE
WITH SEVERAL OF THE IMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ON SUCH A FIELD WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED
MADAME MERLE ADDED HAVE YOU REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S REALLY AT HIS LAST I'VE NO INFORMATION BUT A TELEGRAM UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY CONFIRMS A PROBABILITY
SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAINST HER EXPECTATION ALMOST PLACED IN THE POSITION OF JUSTIFYING HERSELF WHICH LED HER TO INTRODUCE THIS NOBLEMAN MORE CRUDELY THAN SHE HAD INTENDED HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
THE IDEA OF VIOLATING THEM FILLED HER WITH SHAME AS WELL AS WITH DREAD FOR ON GIVING HERSELF AWAY SHE HAD LOST SIGHT OF THIS CONTINGENCY IN THE PERFECT BELIEF THAT HER HUSBAND'S INTENTIONS WERE AS GENEROUS AS HER OWN
THAT SHE'LL MARRY ANOTHER NOBLEMAN WHAT OTHER NOBLEMAN ONE THAT HE'LL PICK OUT ROSIER SLOWLY GOT UP PUTTING HIS WATCH INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET YOU'RE LAUGHING AT SOME ONE
IT'S ONLY THAT I MAY ACT ACCORDINGLY PANSY STARED AND THEN VERY QUICKLY WILL YOU DO EVERYTHING I WANT SHE ASKED BEFORE I SAY YES I MUST KNOW WHAT SUCH THINGS ARE
ISABEL WAS TOUCHED WITH WONDER AT THE DEPTHS OF PERCEPTION OF WHICH THIS SUBMISSIVE LITTLE PERSON WAS CAPABLE SHE FELT AFRAID OF PANSY'S WISDOM BEGAN ALMOST TO RETREAT BEFORE IT YOU MUST TELL YOUR FATHER THAT SHE REMARKED RESERVEDLY
MY DEAR CHILD WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SHE ASKED I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M HAPPIER WHEN I THINK OF YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS THINK OF ME NOT WHEN YOU'RE SO FAR I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
FOLLOWING A TRAIN OF IMAGES BEFORE THEY SINK BUT WHEN DARKNESS RETURNED SHE WAS FREE SHE NEVER LOOKED ABOUT HER SHE ONLY DARTED FROM THE SPOT THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE THEY SHONE FAR ACROSS THE LAWN
WHEN WAS THIS DECIDED SHE ASKED I'VE HEARD NOTHING OF IT PAPA TOLD ME HALF AN HOUR AGO HE THOUGHT IT BETTER IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TALKED ABOUT IN ADVANCE MADAME CATHERINE'S TO COME FOR ME AT A QUARTER PAST SEVEN
AS SHE FOUND WHEN SHE OCCASIONALLY TOOK DOWN FROM THE SHELF ONE OF THE RARE AND VALUABLE VOLUMES OF WHICH MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD SPOKEN SHE WAS QUITE UNABLE TO READ HER ATTENTION HAD NEVER BEEN SO LITTLE AT HER COMMAND
THEY MET HIM TWICE IN THE STREET BUT HE HAD NO APPEARANCE OF SEEING THEM THEY WERE DRIVING AND HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF HE PROPOSED TO TAKE IN BUT ONE OBJECT AT A TIME
OR BECAUSE SUCH A VOICE IN THE DARKNESS SEEMED OF NECESSITY A BOON BUT SHE LISTENED TO HIM AS SHE HAD NEVER LISTENED BEFORE HIS WORDS DROPPED DEEP INTO HER SOUL THEY PRODUCED A SORT OF STILLNESS IN ALL HER BEING
ONCE THEY MISSED IT NOTHING ELSE WOULD DO THERE WAS NO CONCEIVABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT SUCCESS FOR THE MOMENT
BUT SHE FELT SURE THAT UNLESS RALPH SHOULD VERY SOON DEPART THIS PROHIBITION WOULD COME HOW COULD POOR RALPH DEPART THE WEATHER AS YET MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND HER HUSBAND'S WISH FOR THE EVENT SHE DIDN'T TO BE JUST
WHEN THE WINDY MONTH EXPRESSED ITSELF IN OCCASIONAL PUFFS OF SPRING THE THREE LADIES WENT INTO THE COLISEUM TOGETHER BUT ISABEL LEFT HER COMPANIONS TO WANDER OVER THE PLACE SHE HAD OFTEN ASCENDED TO THOSE DESOLATE LEDGES FROM WHICH THE ROMAN CROWD USED TO BELLOW APPLAUSE
THE TALL WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THOUGH ITS GREEN SHUTTERS WERE PARTLY DRAWN THE BRIGHT AIR OF THE GARDEN HAD COME IN THROUGH A BROAD INTERSTICE AND FILLED THE ROOM WITH WARMTH
HE BROUGHT HIS FATHER OVER TO IT AH MY DEAR THE SUM WAS LARGE ISABEL STOOD STARING
ONLY HE MUST OBTAIN SATISFACTION HIMSELF HAS HE COMMISSIONED YOU TO OBTAIN IT RALPH VENTURED TO ASK IT WAS NATURAL THAT AS AN OLD FRIEND OF LORD WARBURTON'S AN OLDER FRIEND THAT IS THAN GILBERT I SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIS INTENTIONS
WITH THE DISPERSAL OF THE LITTLE GROUP HE DISAPPEARED AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAME TO SPEAK TO HER THOUGH SEVERAL SPOKE TO MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS HENRIETTA STACKPOLE HENRIETTA HAD BEEN CRYING RALPH HAD SAID TO ISABEL
WITH AN ANIMATION PARTLY DUE PERHAPS TO THE FACT THAT SHE PERCEIVED HER SISTER IN LAW TO BE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN I'M GLAD YOU'VE KEPT YOUR ENAMELS
AS SHE DIRECTED IT TOWARD ISABEL HAD EVEN AT A DISTANCE AN EXPRESSION IT SEEMED TO SAY WITH CUTTING SHARPNESS HERE'S THE EMINENTLY AMENABLE NOBLEMAN YOU MIGHT HAVE MARRIED WHEN LORD WARBURTON LIFTED HIS OWN EYES HOWEVER
AND ISABEL STOOD BESIDE HER THE SEXTON HIMSELF HAD NOT A MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST IN THE SCENE THAN MISSUS TOUCHETT IT WAS A SOLEMN OCCASION BUT NEITHER A HARSH NOR A HEAVY ONE THERE WAS A CERTAIN GENIALITY IN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS
TO WHOM HIS FATHER HAD ALREADY BEEN SO BOUNTIFUL THEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SMALL LEGACIES SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY PECULIAR SAID MISSUS TOUCHETT HE HAS LEFT CONSIDERABLE SUMS TO PERSONS I NEVER HEARD OF
SHE WAS IN FULL POSSESSION OF HER RESOURCES I FOUND I WISHED TO WAIT FOR YOU SHE SAID URBANELY BUT IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT PANSY ISABEL WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE TO TALK ABOUT
BUT ISABEL FAR AFLOAT ON A SEA OF WONDER AND PAIN COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HERSELF WITH WHAT INTENTION IT WAS UTTERED BUT I'VE NOT BEEN SITTING LONG MADAME MERLE CONTINUED THAT IS I'VE NOT BEEN LONG WITH PANSY
AND THE FIRST USE SHE MADE OF IT WAS TO PRETEND SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM WHEN I TALK OF YOUR HELPING ME I TALK GREAT NONSENSE SHE SAID WITH A QUICK SMILE THE IDEA OF MY TROUBLING YOU WITH MY DOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS THE MATTER'S VERY SIMPLE
IT WAS FROM HENRIETTA STACKPOLE THAT SHE LEARNED HOW CASPAR GOODWOOD HAD COME TO ROME AN EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE THREE DAYS AFTER LORD WARBURTON'S DEPARTURE THIS LATTER FACT
CASPAR GOODWOOD WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER HIS EYES WERE FASTENED ON THE DOORSTEP OH SHE STARTED HE STAMMERED AND WITHOUT FINISHING HIS PHRASE OR LOOKING UP HE STIFFLY AVERTED HIMSELF
IT WILL BE GOOD FOR HER TO SEE YOU I'LL TAKE YOU TO HER MYSELF THEN SHE DIRECTED HER PLEASED GUARDED VISION TO MADAME MERLE WILL YOU LET ME REMAIN A LITTLE THIS LADY ASKED IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SHE JUST HUNG FIRE IT'S RATHER HARD TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING HAS OCCURRED TO ME WHICH MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU AND I GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY IDEA
THEN SHE PUT HER HAND ON THE LATCH SHE HAD NOT KNOWN WHERE TO TURN BUT SHE KNEW NOW THERE WAS A VERY STRAIGHT PATH
AFTER HE ARRIVED IN ROME FOR HE SPENT SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT COMING TO SEE HER HENRIETTA STACKPOLE IT MAY WELL BE IMAGINED WAS MORE PUNCTUAL AND ISABEL WAS LARGELY FAVOURED WITH THE SOCIETY OF HER FRIEND
BUT ISABEL OF COURSE WAS FREE TO REFLECT THAT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF ITS MEANING SHE WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE SHE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP HER LOVER THIS MIGHT SEEM AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD TAKING ANOTHER
IN A VOICE STRANGELY AT VARIANCE WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT I HAVE JUST QUOTED AND THEN HE ADDED EAGERLY LIKE A MAN WHO IN THE MIDST OF HIS MISERY IS SEIZED BY A HAPPY THOUGHT IS THAT LADY THE COUNTESS GEMINI I'VE A GREAT DESIRE TO BE PRESENTED TO HER
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO COME WITH HIM I WANTED TO SEE YOU ALONE SO I'VE BEEN WAITING AND WALKING ABOUT
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD RATHER DRYLY NOT DISCOURAGINGLY AND HE WENT ON IT WILL MAKE HIM SAY THAT YOUR WANT OF ZEAL IS OWING TO JEALOUSY HE STOPPED A MOMENT HER FACE MADE HIM AFRAID TO JEALOUSY TO JEALOUSY OF HIS DAUGHTER
NOT IN THE LEAST BECAUSE HE MIGHT HOPE IT WOULD OVERLAY THE PAST THIS GAVE HIS FIGURE A KIND OF BARENESS AND BLEAKNESS WHICH MADE THE ACCIDENT OF MEETING IT IN MEMORY OR IN APPREHENSION
IF TOUCHETT HAD NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THE SAME I HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT YOU AT YOUR COUSIN'S FUNERAL TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU CAN'T DECEIVE ME ANY MORE FOR GOD'S SAKE BE HONEST WITH A MAN WHO'S SO HONEST WITH YOU YOU'RE THE MOST UNHAPPY OF WOMEN
BUT SHE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO SAY IT HAD DONE HIM GOOD HE WASN'T THE SAME MAN WHEN HE LEFT AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN HE CAME IT HAD OPENED HIS EYES AND SHOWN HIM THAT ENGLAND WASN'T EVERYTHING
ISABEL SAID AH YES YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD DIE OF COURSE YOU MUST GO AND WILL PAPA GO NO I SHALL GO ALONE FOR A MOMENT THE GIRL SAID NOTHING
IT WAS NOT TOO SAD SINCE DEATH FOR HIM HAD HAD NO VIOLENCE HE HAD BEEN DYING SO LONG HE WAS SO READY EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SO EXPECTED AND PREPARED THERE WERE TEARS IN ISABEL'S EYES
THAT WOULD GET ME BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER
IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS I'M SURE IT WILL BE VERY GOOD I SHALL FIND ALL THOSE LADIES WHO USED TO BE SO KIND TO ME AND I SHALL SEE THE LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED
HER COMPANION SOFTLY DEMANDED THE QUESTION WAS A TERRIBLE ONE AND ISABEL TOOK REFUGE IN TIMOROUS VAGUENESS TO REMEMBER ALL THE PLEASURE IT'S IN YOUR POWER TO GIVE YOUR FATHER TO MARRY SOME ONE ELSE YOU MEAN IF HE SHOULD ASK ME
BESIDES HIS BEING THE MOST ILL FAVOURED ANIMAL I KNOW THEN IT'S INSUFFERABLY TIRESOME THAT ONE CAN'T TELL HIM SO ONE MUST SPARE HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HEALTH HIS HEALTH SEEMS TO ME THE BEST PART OF HIM
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SAY SUCH THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW I KNOW NOTHING BUT WHAT I'VE GUESSED BUT I'VE GUESSED THAT ISABEL WENT TO THE DOOR AND WHEN SHE HAD OPENED IT STOOD A MOMENT
HE HADN'T SEEMED ABLE TO GRASP THE GREAT SCHOOL SYSTEM IT HAD BEEN REALLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM ON THE WHOLE HE HAD BEHAVED AS IF THERE WERE TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AS IF HE COULD ONLY TAKE IN A SMALL PART
LOOKS AS IF SHE KEPT ALL THE BACK NUMBERS AND WOULD BRING THEM OUT SOME DAY AGAINST ME SHE COULD NOT TEACH HERSELF TO THINK FAVOURABLY OF PANSY WHOSE ABSENCE OF INITIATIVE OF CONVERSATION OF PERSONAL CLAIMS SEEMED TO HER
THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
DURING MUCH OF THE TIME ISABEL WAS CONSCIOUS OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S GAZE HE LOOKED AT HER SOMEWHAT HARDER THAN HE USUALLY LOOKED IN PUBLIC WHILE THE OTHERS HAD FIXED THEIR EYES UPON THE CHURCHYARD TURF BUT SHE NEVER LET HIM SEE THAT SHE SAW HIM
WITH THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DELAY
WHY SHOULD HE DISSIMULATE THAT'S NOT HIS NATURE
THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON HER HABITUAL RESOURCES FOR HER TOO THE OCCASION WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TREAT IT BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOMENT THIS GAVE HER A PECULIAR GRAVITY
THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE WITH HER THIS LADY HAD SOMETHING IN RESERVE ISABEL'S IMAGINATION APPLIED ITSELF ACTIVELY TO THIS ELUSIVE POINT BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT WAS CHECKED BY A NAMELESS DREAD
IT'S AS IF I HAD ANTICIPATED YOU I CONFESS I'VE BEEN RATHER INDISCREET I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR PERMISSION THERE WAS NONE OF THE OBLIQUE MOVEMENT OF IRONY IN THIS IT WAS SAID SIMPLY AND MILDLY
IF YOU HAD SEEN HER THERE YOU WOULD HAVE ADMIRED THE JUSTICE OF THE FORMER EPITHET YOU WOULD AT LEAST HAVE ALLOWED THAT AT THIS MOMENT
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELVES THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY HE CONTINUED THAT MAY EASILY HAPPEN AMONG THE MOST UNITED COUPLES SHE TOOK UP HER PARASOL HE SAW SHE WAS NERVOUS AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT SAY
IT MAKES SUCH A VERY QUEER RELATION TO YOU SAID RALPH SMILING BUT I'M RATHER NERVOUS LEST YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD THINK YOU HAVEN'T PUSHED HIM ENOUGH ISABEL FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO SMILE AS WELL AS HE
ONE HASN'T A NERVE IN ONE'S BODY THAT SHE DOESN'T SET QUIVERING YOU KNOW I NEVER HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE'S A WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF OF A NEW STEEL PEN THE MOST ODIOUS THING IN NATURE
AND OF THIS PORTION OF THE WILL LORD WARBURTON WAS APPOINTED EXECUTOR THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY WHICH WAS TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BANK WAS DISPOSED OF IN VARIOUS BEQUESTS SEVERAL OF THEM TO THOSE COUSINS IN VERMONT
AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS FAMILIAR LOOK THERE WAS A STRANGENESS IN HIS FIGURE TOO SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FEEL IT AFRESH
IF HE WISHED TO BE EFFECTIVE HE HAD SUCCEEDED THE INCIDENT STRUCK A CHILL INTO ISABEL'S HEART PANSY HAD KNOWN THE CONVENT IN HER CHILDHOOD AND HAD FOUND A HAPPY HOME THERE SHE WAS FOND OF THE GOOD SISTERS WHO WERE VERY FOND OF HER
THAT'S THE MEANING OF HIS KINDNESS IT'S AS IF HE SAID TO ME I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH BUT IF IT DOESN'T PLEASE YOU I'LL NEVER SAY IT AGAIN I THINK THAT'S VERY KIND VERY NOBLE PANSY WENT ON WITH DEEPENING POSITIVENESS
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRACTICAL JOKE
THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION OF THAT SOME ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO ASK YOU I DON'T THINK HE CAN HAVE BEEN READY SAID PANSY IT WOULD APPEAR SO IF HE HAD BEEN SURE HE'D SUCCEED
SHE COULD NEVER SAY TO HERSELF THAT HERE WAS A SUFFERER WHO HAD COMPENSATIONS AS SHE WAS ABLE TO SAY IN THE CASE OF HER ENGLISH SUITOR SHE HAD NO FAITH IN MISTER GOODWOOD'S COMPENSATIONS
BUT NO SUCH NECESSITY WAS DISTINCT TO HER IT SEEMED TO HER INDEED THAT SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY TO MADAME MERLE IN ONE'S RELATIONS WITH THIS LADY HOWEVER THERE WERE NEVER ANY ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES
ONE AFTERNOON IN THE LIBRARY ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE CEREMONY IN THE CHURCHYARD SHE WAS TRYING TO FIX IT FOR AN HOUR BUT HER EYES OFTEN WANDERED FROM THE BOOK IN HER HAND TO THE OPEN WINDOW WHICH LOOKED DOWN THE LONG AVENUE IT WAS IN THIS WAY
THEN I WAS QUITE IN THE DARK BUT TO DAY I KNOW ON GOOD AUTHORITY EVERYTHING'S CLEAR TO ME TO DAY IT WAS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU MADE ME COME AWAY WITH YOUR COUSIN HE WAS A GOOD MAN A FINE MAN ONE OF THE BEST HE TOLD ME HOW THE CASE STANDS FOR YOU
OH GOOD MORNING HE SAID I WAS IN HOPES I SHOULD FIND MISSUS OSMOND HENRIETTA KEPT HIM WAITING A MOMENT FOR HER REPLY BUT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF EXPRESSION ABOUT MISS STACKPOLE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS SILENT PRAY WHAT LED YOU TO SUPPOSE SHE WAS HERE
SHE PRETENDED NOT EVEN TO SMILE AND THOUGH ISABEL SAW THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN EVER PLAYING A PART IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ON THE WHOLE THE WONDERFUL WOMAN HAD NEVER BEEN SO NATURAL SHE LOOKED AT HER YOUNG FRIEND FROM HEAD TO FOOT
SHE FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH MOTIVES FORMERLY WHEN SHE CAME TO EUROPE IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO SEE IT BUT NOW HAVING ALREADY SEEN IT SHE HAD NO SUCH EXCUSE
HER PRESENT ACT WAS SIMPLY A SIGN OF FAMILIARITY OF HER KNOWING ALL ABOUT IT OF HER HAVING AS GOOD A RIGHT AS ANY ONE ELSE TO BE THERE THIS WAS ALL VERY WELL
AND WAS ADMITTED BY THE PORTRESS OF THE CONVENT A GENIAL AND OBSEQUIOUS PERSON ISABEL HAD BEEN AT THIS INSTITUTION BEFORE SHE HAD COME WITH PANSY TO SEE THE SISTERS SHE KNEW THEY WERE GOOD WOMEN
MY DEAR AMY HE ANSWERED SMILING AS IF HE WERE UTTERING A PIECE OF GALLANTRY
ON THE WHOLE AS I HAVE SAID SHE HAD FALLEN FROM HIGH COMMUNION WITH THE PROBABILITIES
BUT VERY DEFINITE DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH PANSY LIVED THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GO DOWN ISABEL DESCENDED AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM THE GIRL WAS STANDING ABOVE YOU'LL COME BACK
HENRIETTA TALKED ABOUT GILBERT OSMOND AS HIS WIFE ASSURED HIM RATHER LESS THAN HE SUSPECTED SHE HAD PLENTY OF OTHER SUBJECTS IN TWO OF WHICH THE READER MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED
ISABEL FOUND MUCH TO INTEREST HER IN THESE COUNTRIES THOUGH MADAME MERLE CONTINUED TO REMARK THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST CLASSIC SITES
SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH SAYING I'M AFRAID I HARDLY KNOW ABOUT WHITSUNTIDE BUT I HAVE YOUR PROMISE HAVEN'T I FOR SOME OTHER TIME THERE WAS AN INTERROGATION IN THIS BUT ISABEL LET IT PASS
AND EUSTON SQUARE WAS A LONG WAY FROM PICCADILLY BUT ISABEL PERFORMED THE JOURNEY WITH A POSITIVE ENJOYMENT OF ITS DANGERS AND LOST HER WAY ALMOST ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO GET MORE SENSATIONS SO THAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN AN OBLIGING POLICEMAN EASILY
SEVERAL OF THEM ARE NOBLE SHE WILL HAVE HER BOOKS AND HER DRAWING SHE WILL HAVE HER PIANO I'VE MADE THE MOST LIBERAL ARRANGEMENTS THERE IS TO BE NOTHING ASCETIC
OTHERWISE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GREATLY IN WANT OF ONE HER ERRAND WAS OVER SHE HAD DONE WHAT SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND TO DO SHE HAD A HUSBAND IN A FOREIGN CITY COUNTING THE HOURS OF HER ABSENCE IN SUCH A CASE
AND IN SPITE OF MADAME MERLE'S DECLARATION SHE ANSWERED AFTER A MOMENT MADAME CATHERINE SAYS IT'S ENOUGH YES IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME ENOUGH I WANTED TO ASK YOU ANOTHER WORD ABOUT POOR MISTER TOUCHETT
ISABEL ANSWERED NATURALLY IN YOUR GRIEF BUT IT'S ON THE WHOLE
SEEMED ONLY HER TRIBUTE TO THE TRUTH OF THINGS SHE DIDN'T PRESUME TO JUDGE OTHERS BUT SHE HAD JUDGED HERSELF SHE HAD SEEN THE REALITY SHE HAD NO VOCATION FOR STRUGGLING WITH COMBINATIONS
IT FELL WITH A LEADEN WEIGHT ON ISABEL'S EARS IT SEEMED TO REPRESENT THE SURRENDER OF A PERSONALITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH WHEN MADAME CATHERINE HAD LEFT THEM TOGETHER PANSY KNEELED DOWN
HER IMAGINATION WAS ALL BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY MADISON AVENUE AS TIME WENT ON ISABEL HAD THOUGHT OF HIM OFTENER AND WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS SHE HAD HAD MORE THAN ONCE THE IDEA OF WRITING TO HIM
HIS KISS WAS LIKE WHITE LIGHTNING A FLASH THAT SPREAD AND SPREAD AGAIN AND STAYED AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY AS IF WHILE SHE TOOK IT SHE FELT EACH THING IN HIS HARD MANHOOD THAT HAD LEAST PLEASED HER
WERE CONNECTED WITH THE BANK AND THERE WERE OTHERS WHOM SHE KNEW MISS STACKPOLE WAS AMONG THE FIRST WITH HONEST MISTER BANTLING BESIDE HER AND CASPAR GOODWOOD LIFTING HIS HEAD HIGHER THAN THE REST BOWING IT RATHER LESS
DEATH WAS DISAGREEABLE BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS HER SON'S DEATH NOT HER OWN SHE HAD NEVER FLATTERED HERSELF THAT HER OWN WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE TO ANY ONE BUT MISSUS TOUCHETT SHE WAS BETTER OFF THAN POOR RALPH
WHEN A MAN'S DYING IT'S DIFFERENT SHE CHECKED THE MOVEMENT SHE HAD MADE TO LEAVE HIM SHE WAS LISTENING MORE THAN EVER IT WAS TRUE THAT HE WAS NOT THE SAME AS THAT LAST TIME THAT HAD BEEN AIMLESS FRUITLESS PASSION
NEVER MIND PANSY ANSWERED IN THE TONE OF EAGER APOLOGY AND THEN THERE WAS A SILENCE THE COUNTESS WAS A LONG TIME COMING DID YOU SHOW YOUR AUNT EVERYTHING AND DID SHE ENJOY IT ISABEL ASKED AT LAST YES I SHOWED HER EVERYTHING
GRAVE SHE FOUND HERSELF AND POSITIVELY MORE WEIGHTED AS BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAPSE OF THE YEAR SHE HAD SPENT IN SEEING THE WORLD
SO MADAME MERLE WENT ON WITH MUCH OF THE BRILLIANCY OF A WOMAN WHO HAD LONG BEEN A MISTRESS OF THE ART OF CONVERSATION BUT THERE WERE PHASES AND GRADATIONS IN HER SPEECH NOT ONE OF WHICH WAS LOST UPON ISABEL'S EAR
AND MISSUS TOUCHETT WHO AS A GENERAL THING NEITHER INVITED NOR ENJOYED CARESSES SUBMITTED FOR A MOMENT TO THIS ONE RISING AS MIGHT BE TO TAKE IT BUT SHE WAS STIFF AND DRY EYED
THREE DAYS AFTER THIS A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOUND TIME AT THE HEIGHT OF THE LONDON SEASON TO TAKE A MORNING TRAIN DOWN TO A QUIET STATION IN BERKSHIRE
ISABEL FANCIED HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF ASKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND RATHER CONFUSEDLY AND THEN HAD CHECKED HIMSELF HE CONTINUED IMMITIGABLY GRAVE EITHER BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT BECOMING IN A PLACE OVER WHICH DEATH HAD JUST PASSED
HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY AN INCIDENT OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO ISABEL THE TEMPORARY ABSENCE ONCE AGAIN OF MADAME MERLE WHO HAD GONE TO NAPLES TO STAY WITH A FRIEND THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF A VILLA
WITHOUT PRELUDE HE LAUNCHED INTO THAT STATELY TUNE THAT CALLS TOGETHER AND TROUBLES THE HEARTS OF THE GIPSIES OF THE SEA FAREWELL AND ADIEU TO YOU SPANISH LADIES FAREWELL AND ADIEU TO YOU LADIES OF SPAIN
SWORD CUT AND OPTIC NERVE MAKE A NOTE OF THAT SO I AM GOING BLIND I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO BEFORE I GO BLIND AND I SUPPOSE THAT I MUST DO IT I CANNOT SEE MUCH NOW BUT I CAN SEE BEST WHEN I AM DRUNK
DICK WATCHED THE SPOT TILL HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE TIDE BETWEEN THE PIERS DIE DOWN LIKE THE WASH OF THE SEA AT LOW TIDE
COCKATOO CREST SULPHUR AGAINST BROWN WITH A NIGGER BLACK ROCK STICKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL AND A DECORATIVE FRIEZE OF CAMELS FESTOONING IN FRONT OF A PURE PALE TURQUOISE SKY HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN AND YET YOU KNOW
AND LOOKED FOR APPLAUSE TORPENHOW SAID NOTHING AND DICK BEGAN TO WHIMPER FEEBLY FOR JOY AT SEEING TORPENHOW AGAIN FOR GRIEF AT MISDEEDS IF INDEED THEY WERE MISDEEDS
NOT QUITE SO GENTLE AS WE COULD WISH BUT WE'LL DISCUSS THAT LATER
YOU'RE OUT OF STEP THEN YOU NOTICED IT TOO OF COURSE I DID YOU'RE ALWAYS OUT OF STEP SO I AM I'M SORRY YOU WENT ON WITH THE PAINTING
AND GRASPING A HANDFUL OF DICK GENERALLY OVER THE RIGHT RIBS SOFT AS PUTTY PURE TALLOW BORN OF OVER FEEDING TRAIN IT OFF DICKIE
A PROPHET HAS NO HONOUR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY SAID DICK RUEFULLY DUSTING HIS KNEES THIS FILTHY FLUFF WILL NEVER BRUSH OFF MY LEGS IT WAS ALL FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SAID THE NILGHAI NOTHING LIKE AIR AND EXERCISE
BUT MEN IN YOUR CONDITION ARE ALLOWED TO BE SELFISH
HIS LETTERS WERE BRIEF AND FULL OF MYSTERY DICK HAD NEVER ASKED ANYBODY TO HELP HIM IN HIS JOYS OR HIS SORROWS HE ARGUED IN THE LONELINESS OF HIS STUDIO
THAT IF HIS FATE WERE BLINDNESS ALL THE TORPENHOWS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM I CAN'T CALL HIM OFF HIS TRIP TO SIT DOWN AND SYMPATHISE WITH ME I MUST PULL THROUGH THIS BUSINESS ALONE HE SAID HE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
THE MARK OF MUDDY FEET ON THE DAIS SHOWED THAT A MILITARY MODEL HAD JUST GONE AWAY THE WATERY AUTUMN SUNLIGHT WAS FALLING AND SHADOWS SAT IN THE CORNERS OF THE STUDIO YES
OR SOMETHING AND THEREFORE HOPELESS WHAT IS MY TIME LIMIT AVOIDING ALL STRAIN AND WORRY PERHAPS ONE YEAR
THE LEAN YEARS HAVE PASSED AND I APPROVE OF THESE FAT ONES BE CAREFUL OLD MAN THAT WAY LIES BAD WORK
BECAUSE SHE HAD HONESTLY INTENDED THAT HER JOURNEY SHOULD END TRIUMPHANTLY AND NOW SHE WAS ONLY FILLED WITH PITY MOST STARTLINGLY DISTINCT FROM LOVE WELL SAID DICK
DRINKING LIKE A FISH BESSIE WHISPERED HE'S BEEN AT IT FOR NEARLY A MONTH SHE FOLLOWED THE MEN STEALTHILY TO HEAR JUDGMENT DONE THEY CAME INTO THE STUDIO REJOICING TO BE WELCOMED OVER EFFUSIVELY BY A DRAWN LINED SHRUNKEN
HEAR HIM BLASPHEMING HIS FIRST LOVE WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HER SAID TORPENHOW BEFORE DICK COULD REPLY THE NILGHAI LIFTED UP HIS VOICE WITH A SHOUT THAT SHOOK THE WINDOWS IN THE MEN OF THE SEA THAT BEGINS AS ALL KNOW
NOW THERE WAS ONE BLANK PAGE IN THE BOOK GIVEN OVER TO THE SKETCH THAT DICK HAD NOT DRAWN OF THE CROWNING EXPLOIT IN THE NILGHAI'S LIFE WHEN THAT MAN BEING YOUNG AND FORGETTING THAT HIS BODY AND BONES BELONGED TO THE PAPER THAT EMPLOYED HIM
AS A P AND O CARGO BOAT BUT CONTINUE AND BE SWIFT I'M GOING TO BED
BINKIE WE WILL GO TO A MEDICINE MAN WE CAN'T HAVE OUR EYES INTERFERED WITH FOR BY THESE WE GET OUR BREAD ALSO MUTTON CHOP BONES FOR LITTLE DOGS THE DOCTOR WAS AN AFFABLE LOCAL PRACTITIONER WITH WHITE HAIR
HE STUMBLED FORWARD AND PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER AND HER HEAD FELL ON HIS SHOULDER HUSH DEAR HUSH DON'T CRY YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT AND YOU'VE NOTHING TO REPROACH YOURSELF WITH YOU NEVER HAD
DID SHE REALISE HER SCORN OF HERSELF
HE HUNG IN THE DOORWAY OF TORPENHOW'S ROOM WHEN THE LATTER WAS PACKING AND ASKED INNUMERABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COMING CAMPAIGN TILL TORPENHOW BEGAN TO FEEL ANNOYED YOU'RE A SECRETIVE ANIMAL DICKIE AND YOU CONSUME YOUR OWN SMOKE DON'T YOU
SOMEBODY HAMMERED AT THE STUDIO DOOR COME OUT AND FROLIC DICKIE SAID THE NILGHAI I SHOULD LIKE TO BUT I CAN'T I'M NOT FEELING FROLICSOME
DID HE CUT YOU OUT YOU'LL SEE WHEN I HAVE DEALT WITH HIM BUT AFTER ALL WHAT'S THE GOOD LEAVE HIM ALONE AND HE'LL COME HOME IF HE HAS ANY STUFF IN HIM DRAGGING OR WAGGING HIS TAIL BEHIND HIM
HE BEGAN BY THINKING OF TORPENHOW'S ADVICE BUT AS OF CUSTOM LOST HIMSELF IN THE STUDY OF THE FACES FLOCKING PAST SOME HAD DEATH WRITTEN ON THEIR FEATURES AND DICK MARVELLED THAT THEY COULD LAUGH
ALL FOR YOUR GOOD SAID TORPENHOW NOT IN THE LEAST WITH REFERENCE TO PAST CLOWNING
THE LITTLE DOG YELPED BECAUSE DICK NEARLY SQUEEZED THE BARK OUT OF HIM THEN HE HEARD THE MAN SPEAKING IN THE TWILIGHT AND DOGLIKE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS TROUBLE STOOD OFF FROM HIM
AND HE COULD NOT LAUGH AT HER ACCOUNTS OF HER OWN MELANCOLIA WHICH WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE FINISHED BUT THE FURIOUS DAYS OF TOIL AND THE NIGHTS OF WILD DREAMS MADE AMENDS FOR ALL AND THE SIDEBOARD WAS HIS BEST FRIEND ON EARTH BESSIE WAS SINGULARLY DULL
AND THE MELANCOLIA BOTH ON THE CANVAS AND IN HIS OWN MIND APPEARED LOVELIER THAN EVER THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF IRRESPONSIBILITY UPON HIM SUCH AS THEY FEEL WHO WALKING AMONG THEIR FELLOW MEN
I'D LET YOU GO TO THE DEUCE ON YOUR OWN MAHL STICK BUT WHEN I CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE TO ME AND WHEN I FIND THAT TO VANITY
GO OUT FOR A WALK AND TRY TO CATCH SOME SELF RESPECT AND I SAY IF THE NILGHAI COMES UP THIS EVENING CAN I SHOW HIM YOUR DIGGINGS
SHE HAD DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND WAS SOBBING WITH HER FACE HIDDEN IN HER HANDS I CAN'T I CAN'T SHE CRIED DESPERATELY INDEED I CAN'T IT ISN'T MY FAULT
THE OBLIVION THAT IS PRECEDED BY TOLERATION AND CENOTAPHED WITH CONTEMPT FROM THAT FATE MISTER HELDAR HAS YET TO PROVE HIMSELF OUT OF DANGER WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW SAID DICK PROFANELY
LEST HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF THE EQUAL OF HIS GOD AND SO REFUSE TO DIE AT THE APPOINTED TIME HE FORGOT MAISIE TORPENHOW AND BINKIE AT HIS FEET BUT REMEMBERED TO STIR BESSIE WHO NEEDED VERY LITTLE STIRRING
THEN I'LL TELL THE BOYS AND THEY'LL DRAG YOU LIKE A BADGER PLEASE NOT OLD MAN ON MY WORD I'D SOONER BE LEFT ALONE JUST NOW VERY GOOD
DICK STOPPING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TO DRAG FORTH LONG NEGLECTED CANVASES AND OLD NOTE BOOKS FOR HE TURNED TO HIS WORK BY INSTINCT AS A THING THAT COULD NOT FAIL YOU WON'T DO AND YOU WON'T DO HE SAID AT EACH INSPECTION NO MORE SOLDIERS
IT'S AS SUDDEN AS BEING SHOT IT'S THE LIVING DEATH BINKIE WE'RE TO BE SHUT UP IN THE DARK IN ONE YEAR IF WE'RE CAREFUL
BINKIE I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU UP BY YOUR TAIL YOU'RE AN OMEN COME HERE BINKIE SWUNG HEAD DOWNWARD FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT SPEAKING RATHER LIKE HOLDING A GUINEA PIG BUT YOU'RE A BRAVE LITTLE DOG AND YOU DON'T YELP WHEN YOU'RE HUNG UP IT IS AN OMEN
WE'RE ALL EQUALLY GROSS NILGHAI NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE FIELD YOU'LL SIT DOWN WINK YOUR EYES GASP AND DIE IN A FIT
NOT THOUGH WE LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED BINKIE WAGGED HIS TAIL JOYOUSLY BINKIE WE MUST THINK LET'S SEE HOW IT FEELS TO BE BLIND DICK SHUT HIS EYES AND FLAMING COMMAS AND CATHERINE WHEELS FLOATED INSIDE THE LIDS
HE SAID ON THE LAST EVENING I I SUPPOSE SO
AND GO TO HER HOUSE ACROSS THE PARKS THERE SHE SAT DOWN IN THE DISMANTLED DRAWING ROOM AND THOUGHT OF DICK IN HIS BLINDNESS USELESS TILL THE END OF LIFE AND OF HERSELF IN HER OWN EYES
THAT WOULD BE A BETTER SONG IF HER HEAD WERE TURNED THE OTHER WAY TO THE USHANT LIGHT FOR INSTANCE SAID THE NILGHAI FLINGING HIS ARMS ABOUT LIKE A MAD WINDMILL SAID TORPENHOW GIVE US SOMETHING ELSE NILGHAI YOU'RE IN FINE FOG HORN FORM TONIGHT
THE ARQUEBUSES TO ME I HA SOUNDED THE DUTCH HIGH ADMIRAL'S HEART AS MY LEAD DOTH SOUND THE SEA
THAT THIS WAS NO PLACE FOR TAIL WAGGING AND SETTLED HIMSELF ON DICK'S LAP TILL IT WAS BEDTIME THEN HE WENT TO BED WITH DICK
OUR CAPTAIN GOT CREDIT FOR SAVING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VERY SEASICK LITTLE PIGS WHEN OUR OLD TRAMP OF A STEAMER FELL FOUL OF A TIMBER JUNK NOW TAKING THOSE PIGS AS A PARALLEL
THAT SOUNDS VERY FINE BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CASE THEY ARE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DO WORK FOR WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THEY ARE YOUR MASTERS DON'T BE DECEIVED DICKIE YOU AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO TRIFLE WITH THEM
LET'S GIVE HIM A LITTLE OF BOTH GET THE BELLOWS TORP AT THIS POINT THE CONFERENCE BROKE UP IN DISORDER BECAUSE DICK WOULD NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH TILL THE NILGHAI HELD HIS NOSE FAST AND THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE IN FORCING THE NOZZLE OF THE BELLOWS BETWEEN HIS TEETH
AFTER YOU WENT AWAY I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH MY EYES SO I WENT TO AN OCULIST AND HE TURNED A GASOGENE I MEAN A GAS ENGINE INTO MY EYE THAT WAS VERY LONG AGO HE SAID SCAR ON THE HEAD
BINKIE WENT TO HIS OWN CHAIR AND AS OFTEN AS HE LOOKED SAW DICK WALKING UP AND DOWN RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING THAT NIGHT DICK WROTE A LETTER TO MAISIE FULL OF THE TENDEREST REGARD FOR HER HEALTH BUT SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIS OWN
DICK QUOTED FROM TORPENHOW'S LETTERPRESS IN THE NUNGAPUNGA BOOK
THAT IS ART I POLISHED HIS BOOTS OBSERVE THE HIGH LIGHT ON THE TOE THAT IS ART I CLEANED HIS RIFLE RIFLES ARE ALWAYS CLEAN ON SERVICE BECAUSE THAT IS ART I PIPECLAYED HIS HELMET
THAT CAVALRY CAN ATTACK AND CRUMPLE AND BREAK UNSHAKEN INFANTRY WHENEVER HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK OVER A LIFE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER AN INCOME THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LARGER AND A SOUL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY CLEANER
GREAT NEWS HE WROTE THE NILGHAI KNOWS AND SO DOES THE KENEU WE'RE ALL BACK ON THURSDAY GET LUNCH AND CLEAN YOUR ACCOUTREMENTS DICK SHOWED BESSIE THE LETTER AND SHE ABUSED HIM FOR THAT HE HAD EVER SENT TORPENHOW AWAY AND RUINED HER LIFE
SO I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED I'M AWFULLY GRATEFUL TO YOU HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU THAT YOU MIGHT BE GOING TO BE HANGED BY THE LOOK OF YOU SAID TORPENHOW
MAISIE THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE YEARS HAD TURNED THE CHILD TO A WOMAN BUT THEY HAD NOT ALTERED THE DARK GRAY EYES THE THIN SCARLET LIPS OR THE FIRMLY MODELLED MOUTH AND CHIN
AND TRY TO ADVISE ME TO MAKE MY WORK BETTER DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT MYSELF BUT YOU CAN'T HELP ME YOU CAN'T HELP ME NOT EVEN YOU I MUST PLAY MY OWN HAND ALONE IN MY OWN WAY HEAR HEAR FROM THE NILGHAI
AND KNOW THE SEA ONCE MORE AND BY HER BEGET PICTURES TO TALK TO BINAT AMONG THE SANDS OF PORT SAID WHILE YELLOW TINA MIXED THE DRINKS TO HEAR THE CRACKLE OF MUSKETRY
AS IF THEIR SOULS MATTERED I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT ART AND SEEN LESS OF HER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAN IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE DO YOU REMEMBER CASSAVETTI WHO WORKED FOR SOME CONTINENTAL SYNDICATE OUT WITH THE DESERT COLUMN
THE NEXT GOOD JOY THAT MARY HAD IT WAS THE JOY OF THREE TO SEE HER GOOD SON JESUS CHRIST MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE GOOD LORD AND HAPPY WE MAY BE
NOW WHAT IS THERE IN THAT NONSENSE TO MAKE A MAN RESTLESS SAID DICK HAULING BINKIE FROM HIS FEET TO HIS CHEST IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN SAID TORPENHOW THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN DOWN TO LOOK AT THE SEA
DICKIE YOU'VE BEEN PROMENADING AMONG THE TOY SHOPS AND HEARING PEOPLE TALK
THEN THE ART MANAGER OF THAT ABANDONED PAPER SAID THAT HIS SUBSCRIBERS WOULDN'T LIKE IT IT WAS BRUTAL AND COARSE AND VIOLENT MAN BEING NATURALLY GENTLE WHEN HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE THEY WANTED SOMETHING MORE RESTFUL
AND IT WAS LONELY THESE LONG EVENINGS A MAN CAN'T WORK FOR EVER A MAN MIGHT HAVE GONE TO A PUB AND GOT DECENTLY DRUNK I WISH I HAD BUT I FORGATHERED WITH SOME MEN OF SORTS
HE DECIDED AFTER ALL THE HONEYMOON WILL BE THAT TOUR WITH RESERVATIONS ONLY
I COULDN'T PAINT EM SUDDEN DEATH COMES HOME TOO NEARLY AND THIS IS BATTLE AND MURDER FOR ME THE DAY WAS FAILING AND DICK THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT THE TWILIGHT OF THE BLIND HAD COME UPON HIM UNAWARE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
AND I WON'T WHINE WHEN MY PUNISHMENT COMES WHAT CAN I DO NOW BEFORE THE LIGHT GOES THERE WAS NO ANSWER DICK WAITED TILL HE COULD REGAIN SOME SORT OF CONTROL OVER HIMSELF HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING AND HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON THEIR STEADINESS
SHE WAS A BEAUTY WHEN I LAST SAW HER YOU CAN KEEP HER FOR ME AND IF EVER YOU'RE POOR YOU CAN SELL HER SHE'S WORTH A FEW HUNDREDS AT ANY STATE OF THE MARKET HE GROPED AMONG HIS CANVASES
MAISIE LOOKED AT THE BLUR AND A LUNATIC DESIRE TO LAUGH CAUGHT HER BY THE THROAT BUT FOR DICK'S SAKE WHATEVER THIS MAD BLANKNESS MIGHT MEAN SHE MUST MAKE NO SIGN
I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE FOR ALL THE GOLD IN ENGLAND THAT'S SETTLED NOW SWEAR DON'T KNOW SAID DICK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF ANGRY BUT I CAN'T
I MUST THINK THIS OUT QUIETLY HULLO SAID TORPENHOW ENTERING THE STUDIO AFTER DICK HAD ENJOYED TWO HOURS OF THOUGHT I'M BACK ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER
I WANTED TO COME I DID INDEED SHE PROTESTED VERY WELL AND NOW YOU'VE COME AND SEEN AND I'M IMMENSELY GRATEFUL
YES NO DO YOU MEAN AMOMMA YE ES NO THIS
THE UNSHAVEN FACE WAS VERY WHITE AND SET AND THE LIPS WERE TRYING TO FORCE THEMSELVES INTO A SMILE BUT IT WAS THE WORN OUT EYES THAT MAISIE FEARED HER DICK HAD GONE BLIND
HERE'S THE PERORATION FOR WORK DONE WITHOUT CONVICTION FOR POWER WASTED ON TRIVIALITIES FOR LABOUR EXPENDED WITH LEVITY FOR THE DELIBERATE PURPOSE OF WINNING THE EASY APPLAUSE OF A FASHION DRIVEN PUBLIC
I'D FLAY HIM MYSELF BUT I LIKE HIM TOO MUCH I'VE NO SCRUPLES HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TRY TO CUT ME OUT WITH A WOMAN AT CAIRO ONCE I FORGOT THAT BUT I REMEMBER NOW
DICK POINTED TO THE YELLOW FOG IF THEY WANT FURNITURE POLISH LET THEM HAVE FURNITURE POLISH SO LONG AS THEY PAY FOR IT THEY ARE ONLY MEN AND WOMEN YOU TALK AS IF THEY WERE GODS
EVERY PULSE OF DICK'S BODY THROBBED FURIOUSLY AND HIS PALATE DRIED IN HIS MOUTH THE FOG SHUT DOWN AGAIN AND MAISIE'S FACE WAS PEARL WHITE THROUGH IT NO WORD WAS SPOKEN
AND TAKE HEART FOR ANY LESSER BATTLE THE NEXT DAY MIGHT BRING I KNOW HE SAID VERY GRAVELY I WAS ALWAYS GLAD THAT YOU LEFT IT OUT I LEFT IT OUT BECAUSE NILGHAI TAUGHT ME WHAT THE GERMANY ARMY LEARNED THEN
THROUGH EVERY STEP OF THE IMPETUOUS FLIGHT TO LONDON FOR HE WAS INDEED DOWN AND DONE FOR MASTERFUL NO LONGER BUT RATHER A LITTLE ABJECT NEITHER AN ARTIST STRONGER THAN SHE NOR A MAN TO BE LOOKED UP TO
SO I TOLD HIM I DON'T THINK HE BELIEVES IT THEY NEVER DO WHEN THEY FIRST START OFF WHAT'S THAT WRECK ON THE GROUND THERE SPECIMEN OF HIS LATEST IMPERTINENCE
FOR DICK WAS RESERVED MORE SEARCHING TORMENT HE COULD NOT REALISE AT FIRST THAT MAISIE WHOM HE HAD ORDERED TO GO HAD LEFT HIM WITHOUT A WORD OF FAREWELL HE WAS SAVAGELY ANGRY AGAINST TORPENHOW
MARRIAGE EXPENSES TORPENHOW BROUGHT HIM THE MONEY COUNTED IT OUT IN FIVES AND TENS AND CAREFULLY PUT IT AWAY IN THE WRITING TABLE NOW I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIS RAVINGS ABOUT HIS GIRL UNTIL I GO
THEN DICK A LITTLE HOARSELY
THEY WERE ALL SINGING NOW DICK WITH THE ROAR OF THE WIND OF THE OPEN SEA ABOUT HIS EARS AS THE DEEP BASS VOICE LET ITSELF GO
IT WOULD BE KINDEST NOT TO SEE ME ANY MORE PLEASE
WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO DO IT AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY HE HAS CAUGHT THE NOTE THAT CATCHES A PUBLIC WHO THINK WITH THEIR BOOTS AND READ WITH THEIR ELBOWS THE COLD BLOODED INSOLENCE OF THE WORK ALMOST SAVES IT
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT THING OUT AS YOUR WORK WHY NOT I DID IT ALONE I DID IT IN THE INTERESTS OF SACRED HOME BRED ART AND DICKENSON'S WEEKLY
YOU'RE ONLY A LITTLE UPSET BY THE JOURNEY AND I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE HAD ANY BREAKFAST
AND DREAMED OF THE MELANCOLIA TO BE BORN NOT TILL MORNING DID HE REMEMBER THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO HIM IN THE FUTURE HE FELL TO WORK WHISTLING SOFTLY AND WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE CLEAN CLEAR JOY OF CREATION WHICH DOES NOT COME TO MAN TOO OFTEN
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AND MADE LOVE TO YOU THE GIRL SAT WITH HER CHIN ON HER HAND SCOWLING
PERHAPS SOME DAY YOU AND I WILL GO FOR A WALK ROUND THE WIDE EARTH WITH NO WORK TO DO NOBODY TO WORRY US AND NOBODY TO COMPETE WITH YOU WOULD BE UNFIT TO SPEAK TO IN A WEEK BESIDES
WE'LL GO TO THE PARK TO THINK IT OUT THEY HEADED FOR A CERTAIN TREE THAT DICK KNEW WELL AND THEY SAT DOWN TO THIN BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE TREMBLING UNDER HIM AND THERE WAS COLD FEAR AT THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH
SAID DICK JUST A LITTLE ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SUNG THE SEA ISN'T SENDING YOU FIVE NOTES A DAY SAID THE NILGHAI NO BUT I'M FATALLY COMPROMISED
I COULD HAVE SAID A GOOD DEAL
HE KNEW WHERE THE DOE MADE A COUCH FOR HER FAWN AND HE LOOKED TO HIS STRENGTH FOR HIS PREY BUT THE MOON SWEPT THE SMOKE WREATHS AWAY
A SOLDIER HAD BEEN NEARLY HACKED IN TWO BY A BROAD BLADED ARAB SPEAR FOR ONE INSTANT THE MAN FELT NO PAIN LOOKING DOWN HE SAW THAT HIS LIFE BLOOD WAS GOING FROM HIM THE STUPID BEWILDERMENT ON HIS FACE WAS SO INTENSELY COMIC
WITH HIS HELMET AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE LIVING FEAR OF DEATH IN HIS EYE AND THE BLOOD OOZING OUT OF A CUT OVER HIS ANKLE BONE HE WASN'T PRETTY BUT HE WAS ALL SOLDIER AND VERY MUCH MAN
WHERE IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET THAT SONG
MODEST MAN GO ON
SAID DICK SHARPLY AND THE NILGHAI OPENED HIS EYES THE OLD CHANTY WHEREOF HE AMONG A VERY FEW POSSESSED ALL THE WORDS WAS NOT A PRETTY ONE BUT DICK HAD HEARD IT MANY TIMES BEFORE WITHOUT WINCING
YOU HAD THREE HUNDRED A YEAR I HAVE THAT STILL I AM PAINTING THAT'S ALL ARE YOU ALONE THEN THERE'S A GIRL LIVING WITH ME DON'T WALK SO FAST DICK
TO ASK WHY THE DICKENS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WASTING YOUR TIME WITH HER DON'T GENERALISE SAID THE NILGHAI BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE NOTES A DAY YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A GOOD DEAL AND BEHAVED ACCORDINGLY SHOULDN'T BEGIN THESE THINGS MY SON
GO TO THE DEVIL OH SEND BINKIE IN HERE THE LITTLE DOG ENTERED ON ELASTIC FEET RIOTOUS FROM HAVING BEEN MADE MUCH OF ALL THE EVENING
I DID NOT KNOW I WAS DRUNK TILL I WAS TOLD BUT I MUST GO ON WITH MY WORK IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT THERE IT IS
DICK HAD INSTINCTIVELY SOUGHT RUNNING WATER FOR A COMFORT TO HIS MOOD OF MIND HE WAS LEANING OVER THE EMBANKMENT WALL WATCHING THE RUSH OF THE THAMES THROUGH THE ARCHES OF WESTMINSTER BRIDGE
DON'T YOU THINK PERHAPS YOU HAD ALMOST BETTER GO NOW HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR HIMSELF AS A MAN IF THE STRAIN CONTINUED MUCH LONGER I DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING ELSE I'LL GO DICK
ONLY THE FREE ARE BOND AND ONLY THE BOND ARE FREE TELL HIM HE'S AN IDIOT TORP AND TELL HIM I'M ANOTHER
DICK SUDDENLY BEGAN TO LAUGH TO HIMSELF WHEN ONE COMES TO THINK OF IT THE SITUATION IS INTENSELY COMIC MAISIE'S QUITE RIGHT POOR LITTLE THING I DIDN'T KNOW SHE COULD CRY LIKE THAT BEFORE
WELL SAID THE NILGHAI TO THE TWO PAIRS OF SHOULDERS HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BEFORE A STEAM TUG ON THE RIVER HOOTED AS SHE TOWED HER BARGES TO WHARF THEN THE BOOM OF THE TRAFFIC CAME INTO THE ROOM
AND RETIRED INTO THE DARKNESS THAT THE SPOTS IN HIS EYES AND THE PAINS ACROSS HIS HEAD WERE VERY TROUBLESOME
THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE SAID DICK PETULANTLY DON'T TAMPER WITH HOLY WRIT GO ON NILGHAI THE FIRST LAND WE MADE IT WAS CALLED THE DEADMAN AND THEY SANG TO THE END VERY VIGOUROUSLY
REPEATING THE PHRASE WITH AN AWFUL GRAVITY YOU'LL BE MORE DAMNED WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU SAID THE NILGHAI UPHEAVING HIS BULK FROM BEHIND TORPENHOW'S SHOULDER AND WAVING A SHEAF OF HALF DRY MANUSCRIPT DICK
AFTER THE MANNER OF SCHOOLBOYS
AND HE TURNED FROM HIS MEAL IN THE VILLAGER'S CLOSE AND HE BAYED TO THE MOON AS SHE ROSE IN SEONEE WELL AND HOW DOES SUCCESS TASTE
DICK PATTED HER ON THE SHOULDER TENDERLY BUT CLUMSILY FOR HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHERE HER SHOULDER MIGHT BE SHE DREW HERSELF OUT OF HIS ARMS AT LAST AND WAITED TREMBLING AND MOST UNHAPPY
BUT OF COURSE I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN SHE STEPPED INTO THE OMNIBUS AND WAS SWALLOWED UP BY THE FOG WELL I AM DAMNED EXCLAIMED DICK AND RETURNED TO THE CHAMBERS
DAYS WEEKS OR MONTHS ONE CAN NEVER TELL IT MAY GO ON FOR YEARS
AND HE SAID NOTHING TILL DICK BEGAN TO DESCRIBE THE GRAY FILM IN THE STUDIO WE ALL WANT A LITTLE PATCHING AND REPAIRING FROM TIME TO TIME HE CHIRPED LIKE A SHIP MY DEAR SIR EXACTLY LIKE A SHIP SOMETIMES THE HULL IS OUT OF ORDER
THE POOR AT LEAST SHOULD SUFFER THAT HE MIGHT LEARN AND THE RICH SHOULD PAY FOR THE OUTPUT OF HIS LEARNING THUS HIS CREDIT IN THE WORLD AND HIS CASH BALANCE AT THE BANK WOULD BE INCREASED SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM
WHEN WERE YOU UNDER KAMI MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY BEGINNINGS I STUDIED WITH HIM FOR TWO YEARS IN PARIS HE TAUGHT BY PERSONAL MAGNETISM
HERE'S A SAMPLE OF REAL ART IT'S GOING TO BE A FACSIMILE REPRODUCTION FOR A WEEKLY I CALLED IT HIS LAST SHOT IT'S WORKED UP FROM THE LITTLE WATER COLOUR I MADE OUTSIDE EL MAGHRIB
WHEN YOU'RE BETTER YOU SHALL GO AWAY AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT WHAT SORT OF A PASSAGE DID YOU HAVE COMING OVER MAISIE WAS CRYING MORE SUBDUEDLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE GLAD THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING TO LEAN AGAINST
PRAISE FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST TO ALL ETERNITY DICK READ AND RE READ THE VERSE TILL HIS TURN CAME AND THE DOCTOR WAS BENDING ABOVE HIM SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR THE BLAZE OF THE GAS MICROSCOPE IN HIS EYES MADE HIM WINCE
I SHALL GO IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RATHRAY'S STABLE WHERE I SHALL HIRE ONE HORSE AND TAKE HIM VERY CAREFULLY AS FAR AS RICHMOND HILL THEN I SHALL WALK HIM BACK AGAIN IN CASE HE SHOULD ACCIDENTALLY BURST INTO A LATHER
ON THE BOWS OF THE RICKETY BOAT FROM LIMA IN THE DAYS WHEN DICK WAS MIXING PAINTS MAKING LOVE DRAWING DEVILS AND ANGELS IN THE HALF DARK AND WONDERING WHETHER THE NEXT MINUTE WOULD PUT THE ITALIAN CAPTAIN'S KNIFE BETWEEN HIS SHOULDER BLADES
OF COURSE I SAID I SHOULD I WAS AT THE SLADE THEN AT MERTON'S IN SAINT JOHN'S WOOD THE BIG STUDIO THEN I PEPPER POTTED I MEAN I WENT TO THE NATIONAL AND NOW I'M WORKING UNDER KAMI
SHE USED TO SHRIEK WITH RAGE WHEN DICK STARED AT HER BETWEEN HALF CLOSED EYES NOW SHE SULKED OR WATCHED HIM WITH DISGUST SAYING VERY LITTLE TORPENHOW HAD BEEN ABSENT FOR SIX WEEKS AN INCOHERENT NOTE HERALDED HIS RETURN NEWS
THE NILGHAI WINCED HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS AS IT IS I SHALL TAKE THIS STUFF AND TEAR IT SMALL SO THE MANUSCRIPT FLUTTERED IN SLIPS DOWN THE DARK WELL OF THE STAIRCASE
YOU'RE SMOKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH
SHE'S FRAMED IN BLACK IS THIS A BLACK FRAME THAT I HAVE MY HAND ON THERE SHE IS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER HE TURNED A SCARRED FORMLESS MUDDLE OF PAINT TOWARDS MAISIE
THE LIFE OF THE NILGHAI IS FRAUD AND SLAUGHTER HIS WRITINGS ARE WATERED DICKENS AND WATER BUT THE VOICE OF THE NILGHAI RAISED ON HIGH
BINKIE SMILED FROM EAR TO EAR AS A WELL BRED TERRIER SHOULD BUT MADE NO SUGGESTION WERE THERE BUT WORLD ENOUGH AND TIME THIS COYNESS BINKIE WERE NOT CRIME BUT AT MY BACK I ALWAYS HEAR HE WIPED HIS FOREHEAD
OR WITH YOURSELF WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT MOREOVER COME BACK BINKIE THAT RED DAUB ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE UNLESS YOU TAKE PRECIOUS GOOD CARE YOU WILL FALL UNDER THE DAMNATION OF THE CHECK BOOK AND THAT'S WORSE THAN DEATH
NEVER MIND THAT IT'S MY OWN AFFAIR AND I'M ALL RIGHT DO YOU REALLY GO YES
THE ROW IN THE SOUTHERN SOUDAN I SURPRISED THEIR COUNCILS THE OTHER DAY AND IT MADE ME UNHAPPY HAVE YOU FIXED YOUR FLINT TO GO
IT'S A CLUMSY ENDING AND VILE JOURNALESE BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE AND YET HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SNATCHED AT THE MANUSCRIPT
WHAT GIVE A MAN PAINS ACROSS THE HEAD AND SPOTS BEFORE HIS EYES BINKIE SHALL US TAKE SOME LIVER PILLS DICK HAD JUST GONE THROUGH A LIVELY SCENE WITH BESSIE SHE HAD FOR THE FIFTIETH TIME REPROACHED HIM FOR SENDING TORPENHOW AWAY
MEAN YOU'LL SEE WHEN MISTER TORPENHOW COMES BACK IT WAS NOT LONG TO WAIT TORPENHOW MET BESSIE ON THE STAIRCASE WITHOUT A SIGN OF FEELING HE HAD NEWS THAT WAS MORE TO HIM THAN MANY BESSIES AND THE KENEU AND THE NILGHAI WERE TRAMPLING BEHIND HIM CALLING FOR DICK
IF THERE IS A WAY I MUSTN'T INTERFERE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CHANCES BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND I WANT TO BE ALONE I WANT TO BE ALONE WHAT A ROW THEY'RE MAKING
HE HAD FELT HIS WAY TO THE WINDOW TO PUT THE WIDTH OF THE ROOM BETWEEN THEM AND TO QUIET A LITTLE THE TUMULT IN HIS HEART ARE YOU BETTER NOW HE SAID YES BUT
THEY SAID THEY WERE ARTISTS AND I KNEW SOME OF THEM COULD DRAW BUT THEY WOULDN'T DRAW THEY GAVE ME TEA TEA AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND TALKED ABOUT ART AND THE STATE OF THEIR SOULS
HE RECOGNISED A REPRODUCTION OF ONE OF HIS OWN SKETCHES MANY PEOPLE WERE WAITING THEIR TURN BEFORE HIM HIS EYE WAS CAUGHT BY A FLAMING RED AND GOLD CHRISTMAS CAROL BOOK LITTLE CHILDREN CAME TO THAT EYE DOCTOR AND THEY NEEDED LARGE TYPE AMUSEMENT
VIRTUOUS CHILD THAT'S THE EFFECT OF EMOTION ON THE YOUNG ALL MY CONGRATULATIONS DICK

YOU ARE AN IDIOT BECAUSE NO MAN BORN OF WOMAN IS STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH HIS PUBLIC EVEN THOUGH THEY BE WHICH THEY AIN'T ALL YOU SAY THEY ARE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER
FOR THE CALL IS ON OUR HEART STRINGS SAID THE MEN OF THE SEA THE NILGHAI SANG THAT VERSE TWICE WITH SIMPLE CUNNING INTENDING THAT DICK SHOULD HEAR BUT DICK WAS WAITING FOR THE FAREWELL OF THE MEN TO THEIR WIVES
IT'S WINDY DIET FOR A COLT I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS DICK MUCH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL A YOUNG WOLF A LION AND EXPECT HIM TO TAKE THE COMPLIMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHIN BONE DICK'S SOUL IS IN THE BANK
THERE'S MORE IN A WEEK OF LIFE THAN IN A LIVELY WEEKLY NONE THE LESS I'LL SLATE HIM I'LL SLATE HIM PONDEROUSLY IN THE CATACLYSM GOOD LUCK TO YOU BUT I FANCY NOTHING SHORT OF A CROWBAR WOULD MAKE DICK WINCE
AND THAT WHETHER SHE LIKED IT OR NOT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE THE MOOD PASSED NEXT MORNING BUT THE SIDEBOARD AND ALL UPON IT REMAINED FOR HIS COMFORT AGAIN HE SET TO WORK AND HIS EYES TROUBLED HIM WITH SPOTS AND DASHES AND BLURS
TORPENHOW WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN AS OF CUSTOM TORPENHOW'S HAND ON DICK'S SHOULDER AND DICK BURIED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
OVER THERE HE POINTED EASTWARD THROUGH THE FOG AND YOU OH I'M IN THE NORTH THE BLACK NORTH ACROSS ALL THE PARK I AM VERY BUSY WHAT DO YOU DO
THEY WAKED THE CHAMBERS WITH SHOUTINGS AND SONG AND THE ELDER MEN WERE QUITE AS BAD AS THE YOUNGER FOR THE CHANCES OF WAR WERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND ALL KNEW WHAT THOSE MEANT

AND DON'T SNEEZE IN MY EYE BECAUSE I TALK LATIN GOOD NIGHT HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THAT'S DISTINCTLY ONE FOR YOU SAID THE NILGHAI I TOLD YOU IT WAS HOPELESS TO MEDDLE WITH HIM HE'S NOT PLEASED
AND ROSE IN THE MORNING WITH A PAINFULLY CLEAR HEAD TO RECEIVE TORPENHOW'S MORE FORMAL CONGRATULATIONS AND A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE LAST NIGHT'S REVELS YOU AREN'T LOOKING VERY HAPPY FOR A NEWLY ACCEPTED MAN SAID TORPENHOW
AS HE ENTERED THE DARK HALL THAT LED TO THE CONSULTING ROOM A MAN CANNONED AGAINST HIM DICK SAW THE FACE AS IT HURRIED OUT INTO THE STREET THAT'S THE WRITER TYPE HE HAS THE SAME MODELLING OF THE FOREHEAD AS TORP HE LOOKS VERY SICK
THE DOCTOR'S HAND TOUCHED THE SCAR OF THE SWORD CUT ON DICK'S HEAD AND DICK EXPLAINED BRIEFLY HOW HE HAD COME BY IT WHEN THE FLAME WAS REMOVED DICK SAW THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND THE FEAR CAME UPON HIM AGAIN THE DOCTOR WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A MIST OF WORDS
DICK TURNED UNEASILY ON THE SOFA FOR HE COULD HEAR THE BOWS OF THE BARRALONG
WHICH HE DID AFTER A WHILE TRAVELLING RAPIDLY UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR IN THE SHAPE OF AN AGITATED GREEN HAGGIS AND WHEN HE CAME OUT LOOKING FOR SATISFACTION
CASSAVETTI IS BEGINNING TO SING SONGS OF THE SUNNY SOUTH ALREADY FOR ONE MINUTE DICK CONSIDERED THE PROPOSITION SERIOUSLY NO THANKS
DICK FOUND A GLASS OF LIQUEUR BRANDY IN HIS HAND AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER HE SAID COUGHING ABOVE THE SPIRIT
FOR THERE WERE LINES ON THE FOREHEAD THAT CONTRASTED STRONGLY WITH THE BRIGHT ABUNDANT HAIR ABOVE
SHE HEARD HIM PACE HIS ROOM FOR HOURS OR PLAY MELANCHOLY AIRS UPON THE FLUTE SHE WAS JEALOUS OF THAT UNKNOWN WOMAN WHO HAD SUCH POWER TO DISTURB HIS PEACE AND FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO SMASH THE MUSICAL CONFIDANTE
AND WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A SORT OF SEWING MACHINE WHEN LIFE WAS BRIGHTENED FOR HER BY THE FINDING OF A FRIEND AMONG THE GIRLS WAS ONE QUIET SKILFUL CREATURE
AND PRESERVED AN EXQUISITE NEATNESS EVERYWHERE WHICH DELIGHTED THE SOUL OF THE ROOM'S ORDER LOVING OCCUPANT SHE ALSO ALAS FOR ROMANCE COOKED THE DISHES DAVID LOVED
CAN YOU BE SPARED SO SOON OH YES THEY DON'T WANT ME NOW AT ALL OR I WOULD NOT LEAVE THEM KITTY CAN TAKE MY PLACE SHE NEEDS PROTECTION MORE THAN I AND THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR TWO
THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
WITH THE PATERNAL EXPRESSION CHRISTIE HAD NOT SEEN FOR A LONG TIME AND MISSED VERY MUCH FATHER FOUND ME AND TOOK ME HOME AND WANTED ME TO MARRY A DREADFUL MAN AND I WOULDN'T SO I RAN AWAY TO YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW I CAME HERE BEFORE
FOR HER OWN HEART WAS VERY SOLITARY SHE MISSED HELEN AND LONGED TO FILL THE EMPTY PLACE
I SEE THIS CLEARLY AND WON'T DODGE ANY LONGER BUT PUT A STOP TO IT AT ONCE OF COURSE I CAN IF I CHOOSE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT FOR I UNDERSTAND MYSELF PERFECTLY
SHE CHECKED HERSELF THERE CONSCIOUS THAT A TONE OF BITTERNESS HAD CREPT INTO HER VOICE THEN QUITE STEADILY SHE ADDED
AND NO ONE SAW OR GUESSED IT UNLESS MISSUS STERLING'S MOTHERLY HEART DIVINED THE TRUTH DAVID SEEMED TO ENJOY THE GIRL'S LIVELY CHAT HER OPENLY EXPRESSED AFFECTION
FOR SHE INFLUENCED OTHERS BY THE SILENT POWER OF CHARACTER SPEAKING LITTLE AND UNUSUALLY GIFTED WITH THE MEDITATIVE HABITS OF AGE SHE SEEMED TO LIVE IN A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD THAN THIS
AND WHEN ALONE WITH HER PUT ON AIRS THAT HALF AMUSED HALF IRRITATED THE OTHER DAVID IS MY FRIEND AND I DON'T CARE FOR ANY ONE ELSE HER MANNER SAID AS PLAINLY AS WORDS
AND NOW THAT YOU DON'T NEED ME I'VE A FANCY TO SEE MORE OF THE WORLD IF YOU WANT ME BACK AGAIN IN THE SPRING I'LL COME I SHALL WANT THEE MY DEAR BUT WILL NOT SAY A WORD TO KEEP THEE NOW FOR THEE DOES NEED A CHANGE
HE THINKS I AM UNGRATEFUL AND IS OFFENDED SHE SAID TO HERSELF WELL I CAN BEAR COLDNESS BETTER THAN KINDNESS NOW AND IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GO KITTY WAS PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT OF REIGNING ALONE
AS PATIENTLY AND AS GENTLY AS A LOVER MIGHT DETERMINED TO WIN HER CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHERS HAD FAILED TO DO IT SOMETIMES SHE LEFT A FLOWER IN RACHEL'S BASKET ALWAYS SMILED AND NODDED AS SHE ENTERED
THAT THE RESTLESS AMBITIONS OF ALL SORTS WERE QUITE GONE FOR NOW CHRISTIE'S MISSION SEEMED TO BE SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER AND MAKING SHIRTS IN THE MOST EXQUISITE MANNER WHILE THINKING ABOUT WELL SAY BOTANY
SUDDENLY FACED THE FACT SAYING TO HERSELF WITH GREAT CANDOR AND DECISION I KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE DAVID MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR ME
AND THE FRESH YOUNG FACE THAT ALWAYS BRIGHTENED WHEN HE CAME PRESENTLY HOWEVER CHRISTIE SAW A CHANGE IN HIM AND SUSPECTED THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT KITTY WAS A CHILD NO LONGER
AND MAKING VARIOUS LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MISSUS STERLING'S COMFORT AS KITTY WAS A HEEDLESS CREATURE WILLING ENOUGH BUT VERY FORGETFUL IN THE EVENING SOME NEIGHBORS CAME IN SO THAT DANGEROUS TIME WAS SAFELY PASSED
WHILE SHE STOLE COVERT GLANCES AT THE TABLEAU BY THE FIRE DAVID PUT HIS FINGER UNDER KITTY'S ROUND CHIN AND LIFTING HER FACE LOOKED INTO IT TRYING TO DISCOVER IF SHE REALLY CARED FOR THIS SUITOR
AND LEARNED HARD BOTANICAL NAMES THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY UPON SUBJECTS THAT INTERESTED HER COMRADE THEN AS AUTUMN ENDED OUT OF DOOR WORK SHE TRIED TO MAKE HOME MORE COMFORTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE THAN EVER
CRIED KITTY STILL CLINGING AND IMPLORING OF COURSE I WILL AND GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK AGAIN ANSWERED DAVID ADDING PITIFULLY AS HE PUT HER IN HIS EASY CHAIR
AND A CONSCIOUS SMILE ON THE RED LIPS OH THERE'S ANOTHER LOVER IS THERE LOTS OF EM DAVID LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT CHRISTIE AS IF INVITING HER TO BE AMUSED WITH THE FREAKS AND PRATTLE OF A CHILD
INTO WHOSE RESPONSIVE BREAST HE POURED HIS WOE AT THIS POINT CHRISTIE PAUSED AND AFTER EVADING ANY EXPLANATION OF THESE PHENOMENA IN THE MOST SKILFUL MANNER FOR A TIME
BUT NEVER TREATED HER AS SHE DID CHRISTIE AND THOUGH NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM THE ELDER WOMEN KNEW THAT THEY QUITE AGREED IN THEIR OPINION OF KITTY SHE EVIDENTLY WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THE OLD LADY
THEE IS TOO HARD UPON THYSELF DAVY FORGET THE PAST AND BE HAPPY AS OTHER MEN ARE THEE HAS ATONED FOR THY FAULT LONG AGO SO LET ME SEE THEE AT PEACE BEFORE I DIE MY SON
AND LIKED TO SEE HIM ENJOY THEM WITH THE APPETITE WHICH ONCE HAD SHOCKED HER SO SHE WATCHED OVER HIS BUTTONS WITH A VIGILANCE THAT WOULD HAVE SOFTENED THE HEART OF THE CRUSTIEST BACHELOR SHE EVEN GAVE HERSELF THE COMPLEXION OF A LEMON BY WEARING BLUE
AND KITTY TOOK A LONG BREATH AS IF HER TROUBLES WERE OVER NOW WHO'S THAT SHE ASKED SUDDENLY AS HER EYE FELL ON CHRISTIE WHO SAT WATCHING HER WITH INTEREST THAT IS OUR GOOD FRIEND MISS DEVON SHE CAME TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
BUT I KNOW I SHAN'T LIKE HER WAS KITTY'S DECISION AS SHE TURNED AWAY AND DEVOTED HERSELF TO DAVID HOPING HE WOULD PERCEIVE HOW MUCH SHE HAD IMPROVED AND ADMIRE HER ACCORDINGLY
AND THEN SAID WITH AN EFFORT GREATER THAN ANY SHE HAD EVER MADE IN HER MOST ARDUOUS PART ON THE STAGE YES I DID SAY TO MISTER POWER THAT I THOUGHT I'D BETTER BE MOVING ON I'M A RESTLESS CREATURE AS YOU KNOW
AND YOU WON'T MAKE ME WILL YOU KITTY ROSE AS SHE SPOKE AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A BESEECHING LITTLE GESTURE AND A CONFIDING AIR QUITE CAPTIVATING TO BEHOLD
AS SHE SHUT THE DOOR CHRISTIE HEARD KITTY SAY SOFTLY NOW WE'LL BE COMFORTABLE AS WE USED TO BE WON'T WE WHAT DAVID ANSWERED CHRISTIE DID NOT STAY TO HEAR BUT WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND HAD HER FIRST PANG OF JEALOUSY OUT ALONE
FOR ALL HER SUNDAYS WERE BAD WEATHER AND MISTER POWER SEEMED TO HIT ON UNUSUALLY UNINTERESTING TEXTS SHE TALKED WHILE SHE SEWED INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN DANGEROUS THOUGHTS
BUT TO STAND QUIETLY BY AND SEE DAVID MARRY THAT EMPTY HEARTED GIRL WHO DARES TO SHOW THAT SHE DESIRES TO WIN HIM OUT OF SIGHT OF ALL THIS I CAN CONQUER MY LOVE AT LEAST HIDE IT
BUT REMEMBER I DIDN'T ASK IT FIRST SAID RACHEL HALF DROPPING THE HAND SHE HAD HELD IN BOTH HER OWN YOU PROUD CREATURE I'LL REMEMBER
OR KNOW WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS TO FIND SUCH AN ONE AS YOU ARE THEN I MAY LOVE YOU AND NOT BE AFRAID OF OFFENDING CRIED CHRISTIE MUCH TOUCHED YES
AND SEE IF WE CAN'T SETTLE MATTERS BOTH WISELY AND PLEASANTLY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AS SAGELY AS A GRANDFATHER
AS IF TO DISCOVER THE REAL MOTIVE FOR HER WISH BUT CHRISTIE HAD NERVED HERSELF TO BEAR THAT LOOK AND SHOWED NO SIGN OF HER REAL TROUBLE
AMONG HER COMPANIONS WAS ONE AND ONE ONLY WHO ATTRACTED HER THE OTHERS WERE WELL MEANING GIRLS BUT
TOOK HER CLOAK AND HOOD OFF AND STOOD STROKING HER CURLY HAIR POOR LITTLE GIRL IT IS HARD TO HAVE TO RUN AWAY SO MUCH ISN'T IT NOT IF I COME HERE IT'S SO PLEASANT I'D LIKE TO STAY ALL MY LIFE
AND THE EYES WERE OLD WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH COMES TO THOSE WHO COUNT THEIR LIVES BY EMOTIONS NOT BY YEARS STRANGELY HAUNTING EYES TO CHRISTIE FOR THEY SEEMED TO APPEAL TO HER
SO YOU SHALL TAKE HER PLACE AND VISIT MY POOR REPORT THEIR NEEDS AND SUPPLY THEM AS FAST AS WE CAN DOES THAT SUIT YOU ENTIRELY SIR WHERE SHALL I LIVE ASKED CHRISTIE
THE LITTLE NEEDLE BOOK WITH THE FADED LETTY ON IT HAUNTED HER
AND BROWN RINGS OF HAIR LYING ON THE SMOOTH LOW FOREHEAD A YOUNG FACE BUT NOT CHILDLIKE FOR IT WAS CONSCIOUS OF ITS OWN PRETTINESS AND BETRAYED THE FACT BY LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES THAT REMINDED ONE OF A COQUETTISH KITTEN
WHO SEEMED SO PROVIDENTIALLY PROVIDED FOR HER KITTY SMILED AND BLUSHED AND DIMPLED UNDER THAT GRAVE LOOK SO PRETTILY THAT IT SOON CHANGED AND DAVID LET HER GO SAYING INDULGENTLY YOU SHALL NOT BE TROUBLED
THAT POINT I WILL NOT REACH DAVID'S HEART IS IN THAT LETTY'S GRAVE AND HE ONLY CARES FOR ME AS A FRIEND I PROMISED TO BE ONE TO HIM AND I'LL KEEP MY WORD LIKE AN HONEST WOMAN
FOR A WHILE IT DIVERTED CHRISTIE AS SHE HAD A FEMININE LOVE FOR PRETTY THINGS AND ENJOYED SEEING DELICATE SILKS COSTLY LACE AND ALL THE INDESCRIBABLE FANTASIES OF FASHION
BUT NO ALTERATION APPEARED EXCEPT MORE CHEERFULNESS AND LESS SILENCE FOR NOW THERE WAS NO NEED TO HIDE HIS REAL SELF AND ALL THE SOCIAL VIRTUES IN HIM CAME OUT DELIGHTFULLY
SHE SAID GAZING UP AT HIM WITH HER OWN EYES BRIGHT WITH WONDER AND HER CHEEKS GLOWING WITH THE DELICATE CARMINE OF THE FROSTY AIR I AM THINKING THAT YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A ROSE THAN EVER ANSWERED DAVID
WITH AN EXPRESSION OF RELIEF THAT SAID MUCH HERE FOR THE PRESENT I WANT A SECRETARY TO PUT MY PAPERS IN ORDER WRITE SOME OF MY LETTERS AND DO A THOUSAND THINGS TO HELP A BUSY MAN MY OLD HOUSEKEEPER LIKES YOU
SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF THOSE LAST WORDS AND THE PRESSURE OF THE STRONG KIND HAND
DECIDED WITH THE FIRMNESS OF DESPAIR TO GO AWAY LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY THE SECRET THAT POSSESSED HER A DEAD HOPE NOW BUT STILL TOO DEAR TO BE CONCEALED
FOR SOME WEEKS CHRISTIE RESTED AND REFRESHED HERSELF BY MAKING HER ROOM GAY
AND I SHALL DISGRACE MYSELF IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY SOON SOMETHING DID HAPPEN ALMOST INSTANTLY FOR AS SHE SHUT THE COVER SHARPLY ON THE POOR POLYPODS A KNOCK WAS HEARD
BUT HE FOUND IT SO EASY AND PLEASANT TO BE A FRIEND THAT HE REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT TRYING IT BEFORE AND EXPLAINED HIS NEGLECT BY THE FACT THAT CHRISTIE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY WOMAN
AND BY SHARING WITH OTHERS THE MONEY WHICH HARRY HAD SMUGGLED INTO HER POSSESSION AFTER SHE HAD STEADILY REFUSED TO TAKE ONE PENNY MORE THAN THE SUM AGREED UPON WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO THEM
AND STRENGTHENED HER BY THE MUTE ELOQUENCE OF SYMPATHY THIS MADE THE HARDEST TASK OF ALL EASIER TO PERFORM
ARMED WITH THIS RESOLUTION CHRISTIE WENT THE NEXT DAY TO MISTER POWER AND SIMPLY SAID I AM NOT NEEDED AT THE STERLINGS ANY MORE CAN YOU GIVE ME OTHER WORK TO DO MISTER POWER'S KEEN EYE SEARCHED HER FACE FOR A MOMENT
BUT AS CHRISTIE BADE HER GOOD NIGHT SHE HELD HER HAND SAYING WITH A KISS NO ONE WILL TAKE THY PLACE WITH ME MY DAUGHTER
AND MISTER POWER CAN GIVE THEE WORK BETTER SUITED TO THY TASTE THAN ANY HERE WE SHALL SEE THEE SOMETIMES AND SPRING WILL MAKE THEE LONG FOR THE FLOWERS I HOPE WAS MISSUS STERLING'S ANSWER
KITTY WAS PUZZLED AND PIQUED BY THESE CHANGES AND BEING A BORN FLIRT TRIED ALL HER POWERS ON DAVID VEILED UNDER GUILELESS GIRLISHNESS
AND THEIR DULL LIFE FOSTERED
YOU WILL BELIEVE THIS AND LOVE ME STILL THOUGH I GO AWAY AND LEAVE YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE PRAYED CHRISTIE WITH A FACE FULL OF TREACHEROUS EMOTION MISSUS STERLING LAID HER HAND ON CHRISTIE'S HEAD AS SHE KNELT DOWN IMPULSIVELY BEFORE HER
I LOVE TO STAY HERE
YOU'D BETTER THINK AGAIN BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND HE IS RESPECTABLE WELL OFF AND FOND OF YOU IT SEEMS WHY NOT TRY IT KITTY YOU NEED SOME ONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SADLY
SINCE SHARES IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PAY SPLENDID DIVIDENDS THAT NEVER FAIL ANOTHER PORTION OF HER FORTUNE AS SHE CALLED HARRY'S GIFT WAS BESTOWED IN WEDDING PRESENTS UPON LUCY WHO AT LENGTH
IT HAS TAKEN THEE TO ITSELF NOW AND NOTHING CAN EVER COME BETWEEN US UNLESS THEE WILLS IT REMEMBER THAT AND GO IN PEACE WITH AN OLD FRIEND'S THANKS
OR ANY KINDRED SUBJECT THIRDLY THAT HOME WAS WOMAN'S SPHERE AFTER ALL AND THE PERFECT ROASTING OF BEEF BREWING OF TEA AND CONCOCTING OF DELECTABLE PUDDINGS AN END WORTH LIVING FOR
UNLESS THE SET EXPRESSION OF HER LIPS AND THE UNNATURAL STEADINESS OF HER EYES BETRAYED IT TO THAT EXPERIENCED READER OF HUMAN HEARTS WHATEVER HE SUSPECTED OR SAW MISTER POWER KEPT TO HIMSELF
AS SHE EYED THE NEW COMER WHO LEANED BACK IN THE GREAT CHAIR TALKING TO DAVID WHO STOOD ON THE RUG EVIDENTLY FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO LOOK AT THE VIVACIOUS FACE BEFORE HIM THAN AT THE FIRE
WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
BOB O' LINKS MAKING RAPTUROUS MUSIC BY THE RIVER AND THE SMELL OF NEW MOWN HAY
AND SET HER HEART ON REPAYING EVERY FRACTION OF IT ANOTHER HUNDRED SHE GAVE TO HEPSEY WHO FOUND HER OUT AND CAME TO REPORT HER TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS
WHILE SHE BEAT UP THE BUCKWHEATS FOR BREAKFAST WITH AN ENERGY THAT MADE THEM MIRACLES OF LIGHTNESS ON THE MORROW WHEN SHE TOLD MISSUS STERLING OF THE NEW ARRIVAL THE PLACID LITTLE LADY GAVE A CLUCK OF REGRET AND SAID WITH UNUSUAL EMPHASIS
SO A FAREWELL FESTIVAL WAS HELD AND CHRISTIE WENT TO IT FEELING MORE SOLITARY THAN EVER AS SHE BADE HER OLD FRIENDS A LONG GOOD BYE THE REST OF THE MONEY BURNED IN HER POCKET
AS GEORGE MAC DONALD SOMEWHERE SAYS HER SOUL SEEMED TO SIT APART IN A SUNNY LITTLE ROOM SAFE FROM DUST AND NOISE SERENELY REGARDING PASSERS BY THROUGH THE CLEAR MUSLIN CURTAINS OF HER WINDOW
AND A SMILE THAT SHOWED HOW WINSOME HER FACE HAD BEEN BEFORE MANY TEARS WASHED ITS BLOOM AWAY
CHRISTIE KEPT HER WORD ASKED NO QUESTIONS VOLUNTEERED NO CONFIDENCES BUT HEARTILY ENJOYED THE NEW FRIENDSHIP
DAVID LOOKED AMAZED AND EVEN SELF ABSORBED KITTY SAW THE CHANGE AND WAS TOUCHED BY IT ON THE MORROW MISTER POWER'S NOTE CAME AND CHRISTIE FLED UPSTAIRS WHILE IT WAS READ AND DISCUSSED
AS SHE CALLED THE NEW REVELATION WAS STOPPED EXTERNALLY IT CONTINUED WITH REDOUBLED VIGOR INTERNALLY EACH NIGHT SHE SAID THIS MUST BE CONQUERED YET EACH MORNING
POLYPODIUM AUREUM A NATIVE OF FLORIDA IS ALL VERY INTERESTING IN ITS PLACE BUT IT DOESN'T HELP ME TO GAIN SELF CONTROL A BIT
BUT RACHEL ONLY COLORED KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER WORK AND WAS MORE RESERVED THAN EVER THIS INTERESTED CHRISTIE
AND OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE WORK OF HER TASTEFUL FINGERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH FRIENDLY OVERTURES
DAVID SAID WHEN HER STORY HAD BEEN TOLD IF FATHER PLAGUES ME MUCH I MAY TAKE THE MAN BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE OTHER ONE IF HE WASN'T POOR ANSWERED KITTY WITH A SIDE LONG GLANCE OF THE BLUE EYES
BECAUSE SHE HAD ALREADY REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT WAS ALL OVER WITH HER JUST AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT AN EVENT OCCURRED WHICH COMPLETED CHRISTIE'S DEFEAT AND MADE HER FEEL THAT HER ONLY SAFETY LAY IN FLIGHT
TURNING HER ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BY A COMPLIMENT AND BEGINNING TO ADMIRE THE FLOWERS STILL WITH THAT FLUSHED AND KINDLED LOOK ON HIS OWN FACE CHRISTIE CREPT UPSTAIRS AND SITTING IN THE DARK
AND DID NOT DISGUISE HER SATISFACTION SO CHRISTIE'S LAST DAY WAS ANY THING BUT PLEASANT MISTER POWER WOULD SEND FOR HER ON THE MORROW AND SHE BUSIED HERSELF IN PACKING HER OWN POSSESSIONS SETTING EVERY THING IN ORDER
LAZY LITTLE KITTY NEVER APPEARED TILL THE BELL RANG
FOR I CAN HELP IN NO OTHER WAY AND IF I NEED MONEY I CAN ALWAYS EARN IT THANK GOD SAID CHRISTIE AS HEPSEY HESITATED TO TAKE SO MUCH FROM A FELLOW WORKER
DAVID'S ROOM WAS HER ESPECIAL CARE FOR NOW TO HER THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE PLACE AND ITS POOR FURNISHING HE HAD FOUGHT MANY A SILENT BATTLE THERE WON MANY A SECRET VICTORY
SHE ALSO EXAGGERATED THEM AND COULD NOT DO ENOUGH TO SHOW THE DAILY INCREASING ESTEEM AND RESPECT SHE FELT FOR HIM AND TO ATONE FOR THE INJUSTICE SHE ONCE DID HIM SHE GRUBBED IN THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE
CHRISTIE WAS SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO SHAKE THE GIRL AND CALL HER AN ARTFUL LITTLE HUSSY BUT CRUSHED THIS UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSE AND HEMMED A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF WITH RECKLESS RAPIDITY
THEE IS A GOOD GARDENER DAVY THE OLD LADY WOULD REPLY AND WHEN HE WAS BUSY WOULD WATCH HIM WITH A TENDER SORT OF ANXIETY AS IF TO DISCOVER A LIKE CHANGE IN HIM
MISTER POWER TOLD ME TO COME TO HIM WHEN I GOT TIRED OF THIS I'LL SAY I AM TIRED AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE NO MATTER WHAT I CAN BEAR ANY THING
AND WAGES WERE THE THREE TOPICS WHICH ABSORBED THEM CHRISTIE SOON TIRED OF THE INNUMERABLE CHANGES RUNG UPON THESE THEMES
FOR YOU ARE ONLY A CHILD AFTER ALL LET THE LOVERS GO AND STAY AND PLAY WITH ME FOR I'VE BEEN RATHER LONELY LATELY THAT'S A REPROACH FOR ME THOUGHT CHRISTIE LONGING TO CRY OUT
AND DISTRACTING LEGS AND HAVING GAINED HER POINT MARRIED HIM WITH DRAMATIC CELERITY AND WENT WEST TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF HER LORD THE OLD THEATRE WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND THE COMPANY SCATTERED
AND TO HIM SHE DEVOTED HERSELF SO ENTIRELY AND APPARENTLY SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT CHRISTIE MADE UP HER MIND HE HAD AT LAST BEGUN TO FORGET HIS LETTY AND THINK OF FILLING THE VOID HER LOSS HAD LEFT
SHE HONESTLY THOUGHT SHE HAD GOT RELIGION BUT IT WAS PIETY'S TWIN SISTER WHO PRODUCED THIS WONDERFUL REVIVAL IN HER SOUL AND THOUGH SHE BEGAN IN ALL GOOD FAITH
NOT AN EASY TASK
BECAUSE DAVID LIKED THE PRETTY CONTRAST WITH HIS MOTHER'S DRABS AFTER RECORDING THAT LAST FACT IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH CHRISTIE
AND DETERMINED TO DEPART WITH ALL THE HONORS OF WAR IF SHE DIED IN THE ATTEMPT SO WHEN MISSUS STERLING CALLED HER DOWN SHE WENT HUMMING INTO THE PARLOR SMILED AS SHE READ THE NOTE SILENTLY GIVEN HER
YOU MUST TAKE IT HEPSEY FOR I COULD NOT REST HAPPY IF I PUT IT AWAY TO LIE IDLE WHILE YOU CAN SAVE MEN AND WOMEN FROM TORMENT WITH IT I'D GIVE IT IF IT WAS MY LAST PENNY
AS CHRISTIE GAVE BACK THE NOTE AT THE END OF HER DIFFICULT SPEECH DON'T THINK ME UNGRATEFUL I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE
AND INSPIRING NOTHING DISTURBED THE CHARM OF THE NEW LEAGUE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS FOR CHRISTIE WAS THOROUGHLY SIMPLE AND SINCERE AND DID HER WOMANLY WORK WITH NO THOUGHT OF REWARD OR LOVE OR ADMIRATION
SINCE NONE OF ALL THE MANY HE HAD KNOWN AND HELPED HAD EVER BEEN ANY THING TO HIM BUT OBJECTS OF PITY AND PROTECTION MISSUS STERLING SAW THESE CHANGES WITH HER WISE MOTHERLY EYES BUT SAID NOTHING
JUST THE PRETTY LIVELY SORT OF GIRL SENSIBLE MEN OFTEN MARRY AND THEN DISCOVER HOW SILLY THEY ARE THOUGHT CHRISTIE TAKING UP HER WORK AND ASSUMING AN INDIFFERENT AIR SHE'S A LADY AND NICE LOOKING
THE FIRST WAS THAT THE SUNDAY PILGRIMAGES TO CHURCH WERE SEASONS OF GREAT REFRESHMENT TO SOUL AND BODY WHEN DAVID WENT ALSO AND UTTER FAILURES IF HE DID NOT NEXT
THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN NODDED TO EACH OTHER TOOK A SWIFT SURVEY AND MADE UP THEIR MINDS BEFORE DAVID HAD POKED THE FIRE CHRISTIE SAW A PRETTY FACE WITH ROSY CHEEKS BLUE EYES
FOR NOW HE FELT AS IF HE HAD NOT ONLY A FELLOW WORKER BUT A COMRADE AND FRIEND WHO UNDERSTOOD SYMPATHIZED WITH AND ENCOURAGED HIM BY AN INTEREST AND GOOD WILL INEXPRESSIBLY COMFORTABLE
THOUGHT HIGH AND HAPPY THOUGHTS AMONG THE POTS AND KETTLES AND WHEN SHE SAT SEWING SMILED UNCONSCIOUSLY AS IF SOME DEEP SATISFACTION MADE SUNSHINE FROM WITHIN
AND LET NO DUST OBSCURE THEIR WELL BELOVED FACES SHE SET THE BOOKS IN ORDER DAILY TAKING MANY A SIP OF REFRESHMENT FROM THEM BY THE WAY AND RESPECTFULLY REGARDED THOSE IN UNKNOWN TONGUES
SEND THE GIRL AWAY AND LET ME BE ALL IN ALL TO YOU BUT SHE ONLY TURNED UP THE LAMP AND PRETENDED TO BE LOOKING FOR A SPOOL WHILE HER HEART ACHED AND HER EYES WERE TOO DIM FOR SEEING I'M TOO OLD TO PLAY BUT I'LL STAY AND TEASE YOU AS I USED TO
SO DAY AFTER DAY SHE WENT TO HER SEAT IN THE WORKROOM WHERE A DOZEN OTHER YOUNG WOMEN SAT SEWING BUSILY ON GAY GARMENTS WITH AS MUCH LIVELY GOSSIP TO BEGUILE THE TIME AS MISS COTTON THE FOREWOMAN WOULD ALLOW
AND MISSUS STERLING WAS SURPRISED AND ENTERTAINED BY THIS NEW LOQUACITY IN THE EVENING SHE READ AND STUDIED WITH A DILIGENCE THAT AMAZED AND RATHER DISGUSTED DAVID SINCE SHE KEPT ALL HER LIVELY CHAT FOR HIS MOTHER
IF MILES DON'T COME AND CARRY ME OFF AS HE SAID HE WOULD ANSWERED KITTY WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH SHOWED SHE WAS NOT SO CHILDLIKE AS DAVID FANCIED BUT THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS SITTING ON A STOOL AT HIS FEET PETTING THE CAT
SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE THROUGH THE HALF OPEN PARLOR DOOR OF DAVID PACING TO AND FRO WITH A CURIOUSLY EXCITED EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE AND HEARD MISSUS STERLING SAY WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
NOT THE FIRST MAIDEN WHO CAME BUT FOR FRIENDSHIP AND TOOK AWAY LOVE AFTER THE BIRTHNIGHT CONFESSIONS DAVID FOUND IT EASIER TO GO ON WITH THE HUMDRUM LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN FROM A SENSE OF DUTY
HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
AND SO WANTING IN THE NATURAL DIGNITY AND REFINEMENT WHICH ARE A WOMAN'S BEST PROTECTION CHRISTIE ADMIRED HIM FOR THIS BUT SAW IN IT THE BEGINNING OF A TENDERER FEELING THAN PITY AND FELT EACH DAY THAT SHE WAS ONE TOO MANY NOW
SHE TOOK INFINITE SATISFACTION IN SENDING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO UNCLE ENOS
FOR SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THOUGH EVIDENTLY YOUNGER THAN SHE LOOKED RACHEL'S FACE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD KNOWN SOME GREAT SORROW SOME DEEP EXPERIENCE
AND WILL LET YOU TAKE A DUSTER NOW AND THEN IF YOU DON'T FIND ENOUGH OTHER WORK TO DO WHEN CAN YOU COME CHRISTIE ANSWERED WITH A LONG BREATH OF SATISFACTION TO MORROW IF YOU LIKE I DO
WHICH IT HAD LACKED BEFORE NOW SOME ONE CARED FOR HER AND BETTER STILL SHE COULD MAKE SOME ONE HAPPY AND IN THE ACT OF LAVISHING THE AFFECTION OF HER GENEROUS NATURE ON A CREATURE SADDER
YET SHE WAS NEITHER COLD NOR CARELESS STERN NOR SELFISH BUT READY TO SHARE ALL THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF THOSE ABOUT HER AND WHEN ADVICE WAS ASKED SHE GAVE IT GLADLY
A THOUSAND LITTLE COQUETRIES WERE PLAYED OFF FOR HIS BENEFIT AND FREQUENT APPEALS FOR ADVICE IN HER HEART AFFAIRS KEPT TENDER SUBJECTS UPPERMOST IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS
FEELING THAT MISSUS STERLING WOULD HELP HER IF NEED BE BUT DAVID TOOK IT VERY QUIETLY
AND MORE SOLITARY THAN HERSELF
I VE RUN AWAY AGAIN WHY KITTY WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW ASKED DAVID PUTTING BACK HER HOOD AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER
AND ANSWERED IN HIS CORDIAL WAY WELL I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU WOULD TIRE OF THAT QUIET LIFE AND HAVE PLENTY OF WORK READY FOR YOU ONE OF MY GOOD DORCASES IS TIRED OUT AND MUST REST
THE THOUGHT OF THAT INVESTMENT LAY WARM AT CHRISTIE'S HEART AND NEVER WOKE A REGRET FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT EVERY DOLLAR OF IT WOULD BE BLESSED
CHRISTIE HAD WON HER HEART LONG AGO AND NOW WAS AS DEVOTED AS A DAUGHTER TO HER LIGHTENING HER CARES SO SKILFULLY THAT MANY OF THEM SLIPPED NATURALLY ON TO THE YOUNG SHOULDERS AND LEFT THE OLD LADY MUCH TIME FOR REST
NO SHE IS USED TO PARTING WITH THOSE WHOM SHE HAS HELPED AND IS ALWAYS GLAD TO SET THEM ON THEIR WAY TOWARD BETTER THINGS I WILL WRITE TO MORROW AND YOU CAN COME WHENEVER YOU WILL SURE OF A WELCOME MY CHILD
HE HAD NO TIME TO ALTER THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE FOR ITS USUAL GRAVE SERENITY KITTY SAW THE CHANGE AT ONCE AND SPOKE OF IT WITH HER ACCUSTOMED WANT OF TACT HOW
AS IF SHE CLUNG TO IT SURE OF SUCCOR AND SUPPORT THEN SHE WENT HOME SO PALE AND QUIET SO HELPFUL PATIENT AND AFFECTIONATE THAT MISSUS STERLING WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY
WE WON'T HAVE ANY SENTIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS NO WAILING OR TENDER ADIEUX IF I'M WEAK ENOUGH TO BREAK MY HEART NO ONE NEED KNOW IT LEAST OF ALL THAT LITTLE FOOL
SHORT AND SLENDER SHE LOOKED MORE YOUTHFUL THAN SHE WAS WHILE A GAY DRESS WITH GILT EAR RINGS LOCKET AT THE THROAT AND A CHERRY RIBBON IN HER HAIR
MOST ASSUREDLY SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TO FIND THESE THINGS LED BY THE INSTINCTS OF A HEALTHFUL NATURE HAD NOT ONE SLENDER TIE HELD HER TILL IT GREW INTO A BOND SO STRONG SHE COULD NOT BREAK IT
A FEW WORDS WHICH SHE ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD CONFIRMED THIS IDEA AND SHOWED HER WHAT SHE MUST DO AS SHE CAME QUIETLY IN ONE EVENING FROM A STROLL IN THE LANE AND STOOD TAKING OFF CLOAK AND HOOD
ONE EVENING SHE SAT STUDYING FERNS AND HEROICALLY SAYING OVER AND OVER ANDIANTUM ASPIDIUM AND ASPLENIUM
I'M SORRY FOR IT WHY ASKED CHRISTIE FEELING AS IF SHE COULD EMBRACE THE SPEAKER FOR THE WORDS SHE IS A GIDDY LITTLE THING AND MUCH CARE TO WHOEVER BEFRIENDS HER MISSUS STERLING WOULD SAY NO MORE
IT MAY NOT BE EASY BUT ALL THE SACRIFICES SHALL NOT BE HIS AND I WON'T BE A FOOL WITH PRAISEWORTHY RESOLUTION CHRISTIE SET ABOUT THE REFORMATION WITHOUT DELAY
LOVE HER FRIENDS MORE THAN EVER AND DO ANY THING GREAT GOOD OR GLORIOUS SHE HAD KNOWN SUCH MOODS BEFORE BUT THEY HAD NEVER LASTED LONG AND WERE NOT SO INTENSE AS THIS
THOUGHT CHRISTIE GRIMLY AS SHE BURNT UP SEVERAL LONG CHERISHED RELICS OF HER LOVE SHE WAS UP EARLY AND WENT ABOUT HER USUAL WORK WITH THE SAD PLEASURE WITH WHICH ONE PERFORMS A TASK FOR THE LAST TIME
OR THE LIGHTER TASKS FITTED FOR FEEBLE HANDS CHRISTIE OFTEN CALLED HER MOTHER AND FELT HERSELF REWARDED FOR THE HARDEST HUMBLEST JOB SHE EVER DID WHEN THE SWEET OLD VOICE SAID GRATEFULLY
IN HER PRESENT UPLIFTED STATE CHRISTIE COULD NO MORE HELP REGARDING DAVID AS A MARTYR AND ADMIRING HIM FOR IT THAN SHE COULD HELP MIXING SENTIMENT WITH HER SYMPATHY BY THE LIGHT OF THE LATE CONFESSIONS
HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT TO HER NOW HIS APPARENT CONTENTMENT WAS RESIGNATION HIS CHEERFULNESS A MANLY CONTEMPT FOR COMPLAINT HIS RESERVE THE MODEST RETICENCE
SO FREELY OFFERED IT CHRISTIE WAS SURE OF THIS
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL THAT HER EARLY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HARD AND SORDID SIDE OF LIFE HAD BRUSHED THE BLOOM FROM HER NATURE AND FILLED HER MIND WITH THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS UNFITTED TO HER YEARS MISSUS STERLING WAS VERY KIND TO HER
AND REJOICE AS NATURALLY AND BEAUTIFULLY AS FLOWERS IN THE SPRING A SOFT BRIGHTNESS SHONE IN HER EYES A FULLER TONE SOUNDED IN HER VOICE AND HER FACE GREW YOUNG AND BLOOMING
THOUGH INVITED TO SHARE THE SUNNY WINDOW WHERE THE OTHER SAT HER EYES BELIED HER WORDS AND THOSE FUGITIVE GLANCES BETRAYED THE LONGING OF A LONELY HEART
BUT CHRISTIE SEWED AWAY WITHOUT A SIGN OF INTEREST THAT WON'T DO KITTY YOU ARE TOO YOUNG FOR MUCH OF SUCH NONSENSE
THOUGH HE LAMENTED IT AND HOPED IT WOULD NOT BE A VERY LONG ABSENCE THIS WOUNDED CHRISTIE TERRIBLY FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN A BARRIER SEEMED TO RISE BETWEEN THEM AND THE OLD FRIENDLINESS GREW CHILLED
WHOSE BLACK DRESS PECULIAR FACE AND SILENT WAYS ATTRACTED CHRISTIE HER EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE LET ALONE AMUSED THE NEW COMER AT FIRST AND SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO KNOW HER BUT PRESENTLY SHE BECAME AWARE
IF MASCULINE COMMENDATION REWARDED THE LABOR FOURTHLY AND WORST OF ALL SHE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HALF CONFIDENCES AND QUITE PINED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT DAVID'S TROUBLE
I THANK THEE DAUGHTER THINGS WERE IN THIS PROSPEROUS NOT TO SAY PARADISIACAL STATE WHEN ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY BEGAN TO MAKE DISCOVERIES OF AN ALARMING NATURE
AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO HIDE THE TRUTH ENTIRELY SHE ONLY SAID THANK YOU SIR I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO COME BUT HER EYES WERE FULL AND SHE HELD HIS HAND AN INSTANT
HERE KITTY CAME RUNNING IN FROM THE GREEN HOUSE WITH HER HANDS FULL OF FLOWERS AND PASSING CHRISTIE WHO WAS FUMBLING AMONG THE CLOAKS IN THE PASSAGE SHE WENT TO SHOW DAVID SOME NEW BLOSSOM
IF I GET THROUGH THIS PARTING WITHOUT DISGRACING MYSELF I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME AFTERWARD SHE SAID AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT DO SO SHE ASSUMED A CHEERFUL AIR
AND GOOD WISHES IN RETURN FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE WHICH NO MONEY CAN REPAY CHRISTIE LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST THAT WRINKLED ONE AND FOR A MOMENT WAS HELD CLOSE TO THAT PEACEFUL OLD HEART
AND TRIED TO CHEER HIS SOLITUDE WITH THE BEST THOUGHTS THE MINDS OF THE BRAVEST WISEST MEN COULD GIVE HIM SHE DID NOT SMILE AT THE DILAPIDATED IDOLS NOW BUT TOUCHED THEM TENDERLY
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER POSSESSION THAT SHE DID NOT OFFER RACHEL
BUT A YOUNG GIRL WITH HER HEAD FULL OF LOVE AND LOVERS THE BLUE EYES GREW SHY THE PRETTY FACE GREW ELOQUENT WITH BLUSHES NOW AND THEN AS HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE LIVELY TONGUE FALTERED SOMETIMES IN SPEAKING TO HIM
AND WITH A SOFT SOLEMNITY THAT MADE THE WORDS BOTH AN ASSURANCE AND A BLESSING SHE SAID I BELIEVE AND LOVE AND HONOR THEE MY CHILD MY HEART WARMED TO THEE FROM THE FIRST
SHE LIKED TO RETURN AT NIGHT TO HER OWN LITTLE HOME SOLITARY AND SIMPLE AS IT WAS AND FELT A GREAT REPUGNANCE TO ACCEPT ANY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULD BE MIXED UP WITH FAMILY AFFAIRS AGAIN
DESPISING HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY WITH THE DISTURBER OF HER PEACE AS IF PROMPTED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT KITTY UNCONSCIOUSLY TRIED AND TORMENTED HER FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
DAVID SAW THIS AND FELT IT MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN ANY GIFT OF BEAUTY OR FASCINATION OF MANNER WOULD HAVE BEEN HE HAD NO DESIRE TO BE A LOVER HAVING FORBIDDEN HIMSELF THAT HOPE
FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR DAVID'S LEARNING SHE COVERED THE IRRUPTIVE SOFA NEATLY SAW THAT THE LITTLE VASE WAS ALWAYS CLEAR AND FRESHLY FILLED CARED FOR THE NURSERY IN THE GABLE WINDOW
WITH THE HAPPINESS THAT TRANSFIGURES ALL IT TOUCHES CHRISTIE S GROWING HANDSOME DAVID WOULD SAY TO HIS MOTHER AS IF SHE WAS A FLOWER IN WHICH HE TOOK PRIDE
AND WHEN WE QUARREL I'LL TAKE ALL THE BLAME UPON MYSELF THEN CHRISTIE KISSED HER WARMLY WHISKED AWAY THE TEAR
DESIRES NO PRAISE FOR IT LIKE ALL ENTHUSIASTIC PERSONS CHRISTIE HAD A HEARTY ADMIRATION FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND SELF CONTROL AND WHILE SHE LEARNED TO SEE DAVID'S VIRTUES
AND WE GOT SO FOND OF HER WE COULD NOT LET HER GO ANSWERED DAVID WITH A GESTURE OF INTRODUCTION QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THAT HIS POSITION JUST THEN WAS ABOUT AS SAFE AND PLEASANT AS THAT OF A MAN BETWEEN A LIGHTED CANDLE AND AN OPEN POWDER BARREL
BUT HUMMING AND CLANGOROUS MACHINERY STILL GLARED FITFULLY IN THE SHADOWS BENEATH THIS TEMPORARY EDIFICE THE STAGE HAD A SMALL HIGHER PORTION ON WHICH GRAHAM STOOD WITH OSTROG AND LINCOLN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
A CHAIR FACED THIS HE HAD A TRANSITORY IDEA THAT THESE CYLINDERS MIGHT BE BOOKS OR A MODERN SUBSTITUTE FOR BOOKS BUT AT FIRST IT DID NOT SEEM SO THE LETTERING ON THE CYLINDERS PUZZLED HIM AT FIRST SIGHT IT SEEMED LIKE RUSSIAN
IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
AND A SWARTHY HUNCHBACK RIDICULOUSLY GAY IN GREEN AND GOLD CAME LEAPING DOWN THE PLATFORMS TOWARD HIM BAWLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN GOOD ENGLISH THIS IS OSTROG'S DOING OSTROG THE KNAVE THE MASTER IS BETRAYED HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
AND VANISHED A PRICKED BUBBLE HE REELED OUT INTO THE GENERAL SPACE OF THE HALL GREATLY ASTONISHED HE CAUGHT AT THE TABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF KNOCKING ONE OF THE GLASSES TO THE FLOOR
YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
TELL ME WHAT WE HAVE DRIVEN THEM OUT OF THE UNDER GALLERIES AT NORWOOD STREATHAM IS AFIRE AND BURNING WILDLY AND ROEHAMPTON IS OURS OURS AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE MONOPLANE THAT LAY THEREON A SHRILL BELL RANG AN AGITATED GREY HEADED MAN APPEARED FROM THE ROOM OF THE WARD LEADERS
HE THOUGHT OF THAT SWIFT FLIGHT OF AEROPLANES LIKE THE SWOOP OF FATE TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ASTONISHED THAT HE COULD HAVE SEEN THINGS IN ANY OTHER LIGHT IN THAT FINAL EMERGENCY HE DEBATED THRUST DEBATE RESOLUTELY ASIDE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE THING HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE
THE IMPLICATION OF HOWARD'S SUGGESTION WAS ONLY HALF EVIDENT TO GRAHAM COMPANY SUPPOSE HE WERE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL DEMAND SOME SORT OF COMPANY
HE HAD A REVULSION OF FEELING THESE WERE NO PICTURES NO IDEALISATIONS BUT PHOTOGRAPHED REALITIES HE WANTED NO MORE OF THE TWENTY SECOND CENTURY VENUSBERG HE FORGOT THE PART PLAYED BY THE MODEL IN NINETEENTH CENTURY ART
AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
WITHIN THOSE LONG PASSAGES AND CHAMBERS GUARDS IN BLACK LINED THE WAY THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD COME AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH INTO THE HAZY BLUE TWILIGHT OF THE RUINS AND SWARMING NOW AT EVERY POSSIBLE POINT
ON A PEDESTAL AT THE REMOTER END AND MORE BRILLIANTLY LIT THAN ANY OTHER OBJECT WAS A GIGANTIC WHITE FIGURE OF ATLAS STRONG AND STRENUOUS THE GLOBE UPON HIS BOWED SHOULDERS IT WAS THE FIRST THING TO STRIKE HIS ATTENTION IT WAS SO VAST
LIKE METAL LONG LAID ASIDE BUT IN NO WAY DEFECTIVE OR INJURED CAPABLE OF RE POLISHING AND THE HUE OF IT WAS A DEEPENING MISERY WAS IT WORTH RE POLISHING BY A MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN LIFTED OUT OF A LIFE THAT HAD BECOME INTOLERABLE
ON THE ONE HAND WAS THE WHITE COUNCIL POWERFUL DISCIPLINED FEW
GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
FLASHED AND SLANTED THEN HE SAW THOSE NEAREST TO HIM ON A LEVEL SPACE BEFORE THE STAGE WERE MARCHING IN FRONT OF HIM PASSING TOWARDS A GREAT ARCHWAY SHOUTING TO THE COUNCIL TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP HE RAISED HIS ARM AND THE ROARING WAS REDOUBLED
SAID HOWARD HIS EYES AVOIDED GRAHAM'S ENQUIRY THIS IS A TIME OF UNREST AND IN FACT YOUR APPEARANCE YOUR WAKING JUST NOW HAS A SORT OF CONNEXION
AND TOUCHED SOME SMOOTH HARD SURFACE LIKE GLASS THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT STARTLED HIM EXTREMELY QUITE SUDDENLY HE ROLLED OVER STARED FOR A MOMENT AND STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSITION
EVEN NOW HE MAY BE DOING THAT THEN THIS PUBLIC THEATRE BAWLED THE MAN IN YELLOW IS ONLY A CONTINGENT WE HAVE FIVE MYRIADS OF DRILLED MEN WE HAVE ARMS CRIED LINCOLN WE HAVE PLANS A LEADER
IT IS LONDON YES SAID THE YOUNGER MAN AND THOSE WHO MEET IN THE GREAT HALL WITH THE WHITE ATLAS HOW DOES IT CONCERN ME
THE MASTER IS BETRAYED THEY CRIED THE MASTER IS BETRAYED SUDDENLY THE SITUATION SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND REAL AND URGENT
ON THEIR WAY THE PLATFORMS CROSSED THE THAMES TWICE AND PASSED IN A BROAD VIADUCT ACROSS ONE OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT ENTERED THE CITY FROM THE NORTH IN BOTH CASES HIS IMPRESSION WAS SWIFT AND IN BOTH VERY VIVID
GIVE YOURSELVES AS I WOULD GIVE MYSELF AS CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF UPON THE CROSS IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU SEEM TO FAIL YOU KNOW IN THE CORE OF YOUR HEARTS YOU KNOW THERE IS NO PROMISE
THE HALL WAS A VAST AND INTRICATE SPACE GALLERIES BALCONIES BROAD SPACES OF AMPHITHEATRAL STEPS AND GREAT ARCHWAYS FAR AWAY HIGH UP SEEMED THE MOUTH OF A HUGE PASSAGE FULL OF STRUGGLING HUMANITY
ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
INAUDIBLY AND INVISIBLY WITHIN FOUR MILES OF HIM BENEATH THE ROEHAMPTON STAGE A STRANGE AND UNPRECEDENTED CONTEST IT WAS A BATTLE THAT WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND LITTLE BATTLES A BATTLE IN A SPONGE OF WAYS AND CHANNELS
HOWARD LED HIM ALONG THE END GALLERY UNTIL THEY WERE OPPOSITE THIS MIGHTY LABOURING FIGURE THEN HE STOPPED THE TWO MEN IN RED WHO HAD FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE GALLERY CAME AND STOOD ON EITHER HAND OF GRAHAM YOU MUST REMAIN HERE MURMURED HOWARD
OR HIDDEN BY THE SWARMING PEOPLE OR CARRIED AWAY GRAHAM COULD SEE ONLY A FEW NEGLECTED BODIES IN GAPS AND CORNERS OF THE RUINS AND AMIDST THE FLOWING WATER WILL YOU LET THEM SEE YOU SIRE SAID OSTROG
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE TAILOR HAD BOWED HIS FAREWELL TO THE MOMENT WHEN GRAHAM FOUND HIMSELF IN THE LIFT WAS ALTOGETHER BARELY FIVE MINUTES AS YET THE HAZE OF HIS VAST INTERVAL OF SLEEP HUNG ABOUT HIM AS YET THE INITIAL STRANGENESS OF HIS BEING ALIVE AT ALL IN THIS REMOTE AGE TOUCHED EVERYTHING WITH WONDER
WAVE YOUR ARM TO THEM SAID LINCOLN WAVE YOUR ARM TO THEM THIS SAID A VOICE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE MUST HAVE THIS ARMS WERE ABOUT HIS NECK DETAINING HIM IN THE DOORWAY AND A BLACK SUBTLY FOLDING MANTLE HUNG FROM HIS SHOULDERS
GRAHAM FELT ISOLATED STRANGELY INACTIVE INOPERATIVE HIS ISOLATION SEEMED AT TIMES THE STRANGEST THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE HIS AWAKENING IT HAD SOMETHING OF THE QUALITY OF THAT INACTIVITY THAT COMES IN DREAMS A TUMULT
HE FOUND THAT HE NOW FEARED TO BE INADEQUATE HE FEARED TO BE THEATRICAL HE FEARED THE QUALITY OF HIS VOICE THE QUALITY OF HIS WIT ASTONISHED HE TURNED TO THE MAN IN YELLOW WITH A PROPITIATORY GESTURE FOR A MOMENT HE SAID I MUST WAIT
THE FAINT HUMMING NOTE OF ITS EASY MOTION WAS THE ONLY CLEAR SOUND IN THAT QUIET PLACE AS THESE VANES SPRANG UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER GRAHAM COULD GET TRANSIENT GLIMPSES OF THE SKY HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A STAR
WITH A LITTLE GREYSHOT BEARD TRIMMED TO A POINT AND HIS HAIR ITS BLACKNESS STREAKED NOW WITH BANDS OF GREY ARRANGED OVER HIS FOREHEAD IN AN UNFAMILIAR BUT PLEASING MANNER HE SEEMED A MAN OF FIVE AND FORTY PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THIS WAS HIMSELF
HE WALKED INTO THE BEDROOM AND PEERED UP THROUGH THE QUICK INTERVALS OF THE REVOLVING FAN AS THE FAN SWEPT ROUND A DIM TURMOIL LIKE THE NOISE OF MACHINERY CAME IN RHYTHMIC EDDIES ALL ELSE WAS SILENCE
THOUGH THE PERPETUAL DAY STILL IRRADIATED HIS APARTMENTS HE PERCEIVED THE LITTLE INTERMITTENT STRIP OF SKY WAS NOW DEEP BLUE BLACK ALMOST WITH A DUST OF LITTLE STARS HE RESUMED HIS EXAMINATION OF THE ROOMS
THE YOUNGER MAN SUDDENLY BECAME AUDIBLE IN A PAUSE OF THE OUTER THUNDER
I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE A SORT OF SPEECH WOULD TO GOD I KNEW CERTAINLY THE THING THAT SHOULD BE SAID AEROPLANES AT MADRID THEY MUST HAVE STARTED BEFORE THE MAIN FLEET OH WHAT CAN IT MATTER WHETHER I SPEAK WELL OR ILL HE SAID AND FELT THE LIGHT GROW BRIGHTER
IN THE COUNCIL HOUSE THEY HAD BEEN IN DARKNESS HE WATCHED THEM APPROACHING DRAWING NEARER PAST FIRST THIS BLAZING ELECTRIC STAR AND THEN THAT THE MINATORY ROAR OF THE CROWD OVER WHOM THEIR POWER HAD LASTED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
IT SOUNDS TRUE SAID ASANO LET US HAVE THE FACTS SAID GRAHAM
THE POLICEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED GLANCED AT HIS FELLOW AND GRAHAM SAW HIM SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS HE MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO STOP THE SINGING AND SO THEY WENT THROUGH THESE FACTORIES AND PLACES OF TOIL SEEING MANY PAINFUL AND GRIM THINGS
A BIG AEROPLANE IS A CLUMSY THING A RESOLUTE MAN BUT NEVER SINCE FLYING BEGAN CRIED THE MAN IN YELLOW THERE HAS BEEN NO NEED BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME TELL THEM NOW SEND THEM MY MESSAGE TO PUT IT UPON THE GUIDES
HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
BROKEN MASSES OF METAL PROJECTED DISMALLY FROM THE COMPLEX WRECKAGE VAST MASSES OF TWISTED CABLE DROPPED LIKE TANGLED SEAWEED AND FROM ITS BASE CAME A TUMULT OF INNUMERABLE VOICES VIOLENT CONCUSSIONS
HE PERCEIVED THERE WERE NOW EIGHT THOUGH HOW THE NEWCOMER HAD ARRIVED HE HAD NOT OBSERVED THEY MADE NO GESTURES OF GREETING THEY STOOD REGARDING HIM AS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A GROUP OF MEN MIGHT HAVE STOOD IN THE STREET REGARDING A DISTANT BALLOON THAT HAD SUDDENLY FLOATED INTO VIEW WHAT COUNCIL COULD IT BE THAT GATHERED THERE
THE DARK HURRY AND TUMULT THE STRESS AND VEHEMENCE OF THE BATTLE RUSHED IN AND OVERWHELMED THEM THEY WERE NO LONGER PERSONS BUT MERE SPECTATORS MERE IMPRESSIONS OF A TREMENDOUS CONVULSION THEY BECAME UNREAL EVEN TO THEMSELVES MINIATURES OF PERSONALITY INDESCRIBABLY SMALL
A THIN HAZE AND THE GLARE OF THE MIGHTY GLOBES OF LIGHT OBSCURED EVERYTHING A MAN SEATED IN A LITTLE OPENWORK CRADLE SHOT BY FROM SOME POINT STILL HIGHER THAN THE LITTLE NARROW BRIDGE RUSHING DOWN A CABLE AS SWIFTLY ALMOST AS IF HE WERE FALLING
GRAHAM HAD A MOMENTARY IMPULSE TO LEAP UPON THE MAN FELL OR STUN HIM IT MUST HAVE SHOWN UPON HIS FACE AT ANY RATE HOWARD'S MOVEMENT WAS QUICK
EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
HIS ENQUIRIES BECAME MORE DEFINITE AND SEARCHING HOWARD RETREATED THROUGH PROTESTS AND DIFFICULTIES THE AWAKENING WAS UNFORESEEN HE REPEATED
ATTENDANTS INTERVENED AND EVER AND AGAIN BLOTTED OUT THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE TO THE LEFT BEFORE HIM WENT THE BACKS OF THE GUARDS IN BLACK THREE AND THREE AND THREE HE WAS MARCHED ALONG A LITTLE RAILED WAY AND CROSSED ABOVE THE ARCHWAY
HE KNEW ENOUGH OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS OF LIFE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CORRELATION AND NOT ONLY WERE THE BUILDINGS OF THE CITY GIGANTIC AND THE CROWDS IN THE STREET GIGANTIC BUT THE VOICES HE HAD HEARD IN THE WAYS THE UNEASINESS OF HOWARD THE VERY ATMOSPHERE SPOKE OF GIGANTIC DISCONTENT
WHY IS A GREAT MULTITUDE SHOUTING AND EXCITED BECAUSE MY TRANCE IS OVER AND WHO ARE THE MEN IN WHITE IN THAT HUGE COUNCIL CHAMBER ALL IN GOOD TIME SIRE SAID HOWARD BUT NOT CRUDELY NOT CRUDELY
THE VOICES WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND UPBORNE BY A TORRENT OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC MUSIC LIKE THE MUSIC OF AN ORGAN
HE OPENED A SORT OF LID AND FOUND ONE OF THE DOUBLE CYLINDERS WITHIN AND ON THE UPPER EDGE A LITTLE STUD LIKE THE STUD OF AN ELECTRIC BELL HE PRESSED THIS AND A RAPID CLICKING BEGAN AND CEASED HE BECAME AWARE OF VOICES AND MUSIC AND NOTICED A PLAY OF COLOUR ON THE SMOOTH FRONT FACE
HE SAID CONCISELY AND THEY WENT ON IN SILENCE TO A LITTLE DOOR THAT OPENED AT THEIR APPROACH THE TWO MEN IN RED STOPPED ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DOOR HOWARD AND GRAHAM PASSED IN AND GRAHAM GLANCING BACK SAW THE WHITE ROBED COUNCIL STILL STANDING IN A CLOSE GROUP AND LOOKING AT HIM
LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
WOULD THERE BE ANY POSSIBILITIES OF GATHERING FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THIS ADDITIONAL PERSON SOME VAGUE INKLING OF THE STRUGGLE THAT HAD BROKEN OUT SO VIVIDLY AT HIS WAKING MOMENT HE MEDITATED AGAIN
HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
LOOKED DOWN BETWEEN HIS LEGS UPON THE SWARMING BLUE AND RED MULTITUDES MINUTE AND FORESHORTENED STRUGGLING AND GESTICULATING STILL TOWARDS THE LITTLE BALCONY FAR BELOW A LITTLE TOY BALCONY IT SEEMED WHERE HE HAD SO RECENTLY BEEN STANDING
IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
A FLASH OF LAUGHTER CAME WITH THE RECOGNITION
AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
THE AUTOMATIC INCREASE OF YOUR PROPERTY PUTS GREAT POSSIBILITIES OF INTERFERENCE IN YOUR HANDS
COUNCILLORS UNDER THE ATLAS WHY SHOULD THEY TRY TO DRUG ME TO KEEP YOU INSENSIBLE SAID THE MAN IN YELLOW TO PREVENT YOUR INTERFERENCE
A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
I SUPPOSE THEY CAN FLY AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS LET ME TRY AND REMEMBER JUST HOW IT BEGAN HE WAS SURPRISED AT FIRST TO FIND HOW VAGUE THE MEMORIES OF HIS FIRST THIRTY YEARS HAD BECOME HE REMEMBERED FRAGMENTS FOR THE MOST PART TRIVIAL MOMENTS THINGS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT HE HAD OBSERVED
A TALL SALLOW DARK HAIRED SHINING EYED YOUTH WHITE CLAD FROM TOP TO TOE CLAMBERED UP TOWARDS THE PLATFORM SHOUTING LOYALLY AND SPRANG DOWN AGAIN AND RECEDED LOOKING BACKWARD HEADS SHOULDERS
WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
PERHAPS THEY WERE DOING A LITTLE OF BOTH PERHAPS SOME POWER UNSEEN AND UNSUSPECTED PROPELLED THEM ALL HE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH AWARE OF CERTAIN GRANDIOSE PHRASES FLOATING IN HIS MIND AS THE THING HE MEANT TO SAY
TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
THIS MONOPLANE IT IS A CHANCE YOU DON'T MEAN TO FIGHT YES TO FIGHT IN THE AIR
HAD THE ODDEST EFFECT THE WORK WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED
HE PROWLED ABOUT HIS APARTMENT EXAMINING EVERYTHING AS A CAGED ANIMAL MIGHT DO HE WAS VERY TIRED WITH THAT FEVERISH EXHAUSTION THAT DOES NOT ADMIT OF REST HE LISTENED FOR LONG SPACES UNDER THE VENTILATOR TO CATCH SOME DISTANT ECHO OF THE TUMULTS HE
EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
AS THEY CROSSED THE GALLERY HE HEARD A WHISPER FROM BELOW THE SLEEPER AND WAS AWARE OF A TURNING OF HEADS A HUM OF OBSERVATION THEY ENTERED ANOTHER LITTLE PASSAGE IN THE WALL OF THIS ANTE CHAMBER
TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
AND ANOTHER THING DAWNED UPON HIM THERE WAS NO FIREPLACE IN EITHER ROOM WAS THE SEASON SUMMER AND WERE THESE MERELY SUMMER APARTMENTS OR WAS THE WHOLE CITY UNIFORMLY HEATED OR COOLED HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THESE QUESTIONS
AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
AT LAST THE MINIATURE DRAMA CAME TO AN END AND THE SQUARE FACE OF THE APPARATUS WAS BLANK AGAIN
HE GRASPED THE ARM OF THIS SHOUTING PERSON TELL ME HE CRIED WHO AM I WHO AM I THE OTHERS CAME NEARER TO HEAR HIS WORDS
THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
BUT A MOMENT THAT WAS NEAR TO PANIC PASSED HE TRIED TO MAKE AUDIBLE INQUIRIES OF
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEW AGE HE SAID YOU HAVE ARISEN TO DO BATTLE FOR THE RACE THERE IS NO EASY VICTORY BEFORE US HE STOPPED TO GATHER WORDS HE WISHED PASSIONATELY FOR THE GIFT OF MOVING SPEECH
HE TURNED BACK TO HER YOU HAVE HELPED ME HE SAID LAMELY HELPED ME VERY MUCH THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT HE PAUSED HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE UNSEEN MULTITUDES WHO STARED UPON HIM THROUGH THOSE GROTESQUE BLACK EYES AT FIRST HE SPOKE SLOWLY
HE HAD FRAMED SOME VAGUE SENTENCE OF DEMOCRATIC SENTIMENT WHEN SUDDENLY DOUBTS OVERWHELMED HIM HIS BELIEF IN HIS HEROIC QUALITY AND CALLING HE FOUND HAD ALTOGETHER LOST ITS ASSURED CONVICTION
A VAST ASCENDING CLAMOUR AND CONFUSION BEFORE THE COUNCIL CAME OUT TOILING PERSPIRING MEN DIRECTED BY A CONFLICT OF SHOUTS CARRIED FORTH HUNDREDS OF THOSE WHO HAD PERISHED IN THE HAND TO HAND CONFLICT
THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
BUT WHY THESE THINGS SHOULD BE SO HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE DOOR OPENED LINCOLN'S VOICE WAS SWEPT AWAY AND DROWNED AND A RASH OF PEOPLE FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS OF THE TUMULT THESE INTRUDERS CAME TOWARDS HIM
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY HAD COME OUT HIGH UP ON THE BROW OF THE CLIFF OF TORN BUILDINGS THAT OVERHUNG THE WRECKAGE THE VAST AREA OPENED TO GRAHAM'S EYES NONE THE LESS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL FOR THE REMOTE VIEW HE HAD HAD OF IT IN THE OVAL MIRROR
PERHAPS YET NOT TO DO IT OR TO LET SOME ONE ELSE ATTEMPT IT YOU WILL BE KILLED SHE REPEATED I'VE SAID MY WORD DO YOU NOT SEE IT MAY SAVE LONDON HE STOPPED HE COULD SPEAK NO MORE
HE WALKED SLANTINGWAYS ACROSS THE ROOM AND TURNED BLOWING OUT HIS CHEEKS AGAIN UGH HE GRUNTED A MAN RELIEVED GRAHAM STOOD REGARDING HIM YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BEGAN HOWARD ABRUPTLY AVOIDING GRAHAM'S EYES
HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
BUT WHITHER COULD HE ESCAPE INTO THIS VAST CROWDED WORLD HE WOULD BE WORSE OFF THAN A SAXON YEOMAN SUDDENLY DROPPED INTO NINETEENTH CENTURY LONDON AND BESIDES HOW COULD ANYONE ESCAPE FROM THESE ROOMS HOW CAN IT BENEFIT ANYONE IF HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME
THERE CAME AN AGITATED MESSENGER WITH NEWS THAT THE FOREMOST AEROPLANES WERE PASSING OVER MADRID WHAT NEWS OF THE FLYING STAGES HE ASKED THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH WEST WARDS ARE READY READY
IN THE CORNER OF THE CASE WAS A STAND OF GLITTERING AND DELICATELY MADE APPARATUS FOR THE MOST PART QUITE STRANGE APPLIANCES THOUGH A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETER WAS RECOGNISABLE
I MUST THINK OF THE THING I HAVE TO SAY
TO ASK YOU TO KEEP IN SECLUSION GRAHAM TURNED ON HIM THIS IS STRANGE HE SAID NO HARM WILL BE DONE YOU NO HARM BUT YOU MUST BE KEPT HERE WHILE I LEARN MY POSITION I PRESUME PRECISELY
THE THING IS THIS SAID GRAHAM YOU ARE AFRAID OF SOMETHING I SHALL DO IN SOME WAY I AM ARBITRATOR I MIGHT BE ARBITRATOR IT IS NOT THAT BUT YOU HAVE I MAY TELL YOU THIS MUCH
WHEN HE SAW A NUMBER OF BLUE CLAD CHILDREN RUNNING DOWN A TRANSVERSE PASSAGE AND PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THE REASON OF THEIR PANIC IN A COMPANY OF THE LABOUR POLICE ARMED WITH CLUBS TROTTING TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN DISTURBANCE AND THEN CAME A REMOTE DISORDER
NOW DARK AND HOPELESS NOW CLEAR AND GHASTLY HE WAS MASTER OF THE EARTH HE WAS A MAN SODDEN WITH THAWING SNOW OF ALL HIS FLUCTUATING IMPRESSIONS THE DOMINANT ONES PRESENTED AN ANTAGONISM
WHEN HE ATTEMPTED NEXT DAY TO REPLACE THESE TANNHAUSER CYLINDERS BY ANOTHER PAIR HE FOUND THE APPARATUS BROKEN HE STRUCK OUT A PATH OBLIQUE TO THE ROOM AND PACED TO AND FRO STRUGGLING WITH INTOLERABLE VAST IMPRESSIONS
THE MASTER THE MASTER GOD AND THE MASTER SHOUTED THE PEOPLE TO HELL WITH THE COUNCIL GRAHAM LOOKED AT THEIR MULTITUDES RECEDING BEYOND COUNTING INTO A SHOUTING HAZE
TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
WHOSE SECRET MANUFACTURE AND SUDDEN DISTRIBUTION IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES HAD BEEN ONE OF OSTROG'S CULMINATING MOVES AGAINST THE COUNCIL
THREADED BY ONE MONOTONOUS VOICE NOW SUDDENLY TRAMPLING ON THESE LAST WORDS CAME A DEAFENING TUMULT A ROARING AND THUNDERING CHEER CROWDED ON CHEER VOICES HOARSE AND SHRILL BEATING OVERLAPPING AND WHILE IT LASTED
AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
I AM SORRY HE WENT TOWARDS THE NOISELESS DOOR HESITATED AND VANISHED GRAHAM WALKED TO THE DOOR TRIED IT FOUND IT SECURELY FASTENED IN SOME WAY HE NEVER CAME TO UNDERSTAND TURNED ABOUT PACED THE ROOM RESTLESSLY
IN THE CAPTURED COUNCIL HOUSE AND ALONG THE SHATTERED CLIFF OF ITS CIRCUMADJACENT BUILDINGS WERE INNUMERABLE PEOPLE AND THEIR VOICES EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NOT CHEERING
WE MUST CAPTURE THE FLYING STAGES HE EXPLAINED UNLESS WE CAN DO THAT THEY WILL LAND NEGROES AT ALL COSTS WE MUST PREVENT THAT HE FELT EVEN AS HE SPOKE THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HAD BEEN IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE INTERRUPTION
SO PATIENTLY AND PAINFULLY REAL SO WHITE AND SIMPLE SAVE FOR THIS FIGURE AND FOR A DAIS IN THE CENTRE
WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
THE MARVEL OF HIS FATE MINGLED WITH AND IN SOME WAY MINIMISED THE MARVEL OF HIS SURVIVAL HE HAD AWAKENED TO MANKIND IT SEEMED ONLY TO BE SNATCHED AWAY INTO THIS UNACCOUNTABLE SOLITUDE HOWARD CAME REGULARLY WITH SUBTLY SUSTAINING AND NUTRITIVE FLUIDS
THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
DO YOU MEAN THEY ARE FOUND TOO LATE SAID THE OLD MAN IF WE COULD STOP THEM ANOTHER HOUR CRIED THE MAN IN YELLOW NOTHING CAN STOP THEM NOW SAID THE OLD MAN THEY HAVE NEAR A HUNDRED AEROPLANES IN THE FIRST FLEET
THIS AUDIENCE OF GAPING GLARING MACHINES HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS ANTICIPATION ALL HIS SUPPORTS SEEMED WITHDRAWN TOGETHER HE SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED INTO THIS SUDDENLY SUDDENLY TO HAVE DISCOVERED HIMSELF IN A MOMENT HE WAS CHANGED
THE DAIS WAS REMOTE IN THE GREATNESS OF THE AREA IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED A MERE SLAB OF METAL HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE GROUP OF SEVEN MEN WHO STOOD ABOUT A TABLE ON IT AND GAVE AN INKLING OF ITS PROPORTIONS
EVEN NOW THERE IS A RUMOUR OF FIGHTING BEGINNING THE MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIMSELF LINCOLN CAME CLOSE TO HIM OSTROG HAS IT PLANNED TRUST HIM WE HAVE OUR ORGANISATIONS READY WE SHALL SEIZE THE FLYING STAGES
THEN THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM WITH A HEAVY THUD AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS AWAKENING HE WAS IN SILENCE THE FLOOR EVEN WAS NOISELESS TO HIS FEET
AND LINCOLN GESTICULATING THE VOICES WITHOUT EXPLAINED THEIR SOUNDLESS LIPS SHOW US THE SLEEPER SHOW US THE SLEEPER WAS THE BURDEN OF THE UPROAR MEN WERE BAWLING FOR ORDER SILENCE
THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
THESE PEOPLE HAD SPOKEN OF THE COUNCIL WITH SUGGESTIONS OF A VAGUE UNIVERSALITY OF POWER AND THEY HAD SPOKEN OF THE SLEEPER IT HAD NOT REALLY STRUCK HIM VIVIDLY AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS THE SLEEPER HE HAD TO RECALL PRECISELY WHAT THEY HAD SAID
MARCHED ALONG BESIDE THEM AS THEY DREW STILL NEARER THEIR FACES CAME OUT WEARY WHITE AND ANXIOUS HE SAW THEM BLINKING UP THROUGH THE GLARE ABOUT HIM AND OSTROG
AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
HE JUDGED THEY KNEW HOWARD AND NOT HIMSELF AND THAT THEY WONDERED WHO HE WAS THIS HOWARD IT SEEMED
THAT WAS ODD THERE CAME A PASSAGE IN TWILIGHT AND INTO THIS PASSAGE A FOOTWAY HUNG SO THAT HE COULD SEE THE FEET AND ANKLES OF PEOPLE GOING TO AND FRO THEREON BUT NO MORE OF THEM
THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
THEN HOWARD HAD THRUST HIM FORWARD ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND HE WAS IN A LITTLE NARROW PASSAGE DECORATED WITH GEOMETRICAL PATTERNS I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT CRIED GRAHAM RESISTING NO NO CRIED HOWARD STILL GRIPPING HIS ARM THIS WAY YOU MUST GO THIS WAY
HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE HEARD ARIGHT HE RESISTED THE PERSUASION HE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND NOT TO HEAR HE LIFTED HIS VOICE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AWAKE THREE DAYS A PRISONER THREE DAYS
WITH A SENSE OF THE IRRATIONAL WITH SOMETHING OF THE QUALITY OF A REALISTIC DREAM HE WAS STILL DETACHED AN ASTONISHED SPECTATOR STILL BUT HALF INVOLVED IN LIFE WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND ESPECIALLY THE LAST CROWDED TUMULT
THE STUPENDOUS REALISATION OF A WORLD STRUGGLE BETWEEN OSTROG AND HIMSELF
THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
THERE THRUST THE TWISTED END OF A WATER MAIN TWO HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR THUNDEROUSLY SPOUTING A SHINING CASCADE AND EVERYWHERE GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE WHEREVER THERE WAS SPACE AND FOOTHOLD PEOPLE SWARMED
IT IS A THING I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE THOUGHT OF BEFORE BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT SO MUCH IS HAPPENING HE INDICATED THE EXTERIOR WORLD GRAHAM HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THE FIGURE OF A POSSIBLE WOMAN DOMINATED HIS MIND WITH AN INTENSE ATTRACTION
MASSED IN THE INAUDIBLE IT IS NOW OR NEVER THE COUNCIL IS ROCKING THEY CANNOT TRUST EVEN THEIR DRILLED MEN HEAR THE PEOPLE CALLING TO YOU GRAHAM'S MIND WAS LIKE A NIGHT OF MOON AND SWIFT CLOUDS
AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
HOWARD OPENED ANOTHER DOOR AND THEY WERE IN THE FIRST OF TWO CONTIGUOUS CHAMBERS FURNISHED IN WHITE AND GREEN WHAT COUNCIL WAS THAT BEGAN GRAHAM WHAT WERE THEY DISCUSSING WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO WITH ME
PRESENTLY HE COULD RECOGNISE SEVERAL OF THEM THE MAN WHO HAD RAPPED THE TABLE AT HOWARD A BURLY MAN WITH A RED BEARD AND ONE DELICATE FEATURED SHORT DARK MAN WITH A PECULIARLY LONG SKULL
BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
HE FOUND THE LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT EXALTATION REFLECTED IN THE FACE OF THE GIRL THEIR EYES MET HER EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS OF ENTHUSIASM I KNEW SHE WHISPERED OH FATHER OF THE WORLD SIRE I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THESE THINGS
AT LINCOLN'S PRESSURE HE TURNED TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY WALKING UNCONSCIOUSLY IN THAT RHYTHM SCARCELY NOTICING HIS MOVEMENT FOR THE MELODY AND STIR OF IT THE MULTITUDE THE GESTURE AND SONG ALL MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION
AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
AND SO CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY ALL THE TIME THAT GRAHAM REMAINED IN THE LITTLE ROOM HE WATCHED THE LIPS OF THE MAN IN BLACK AND GATHERED THAT HE WAS MAKING SOME EXPLANATION HE STARED STUPIDLY FOR SOME MOMENTS AT THESE THINGS AND THEN STOOD UP ABRUPTLY
CAME NO NEWS IN SPITE OF GRAHAM'S URGENCY NOR ANY REPORT OF SUCCESSES FROM THE DENSE FELT OF FIGHTING STRANDS ABOUT THE FLYING STAGES SECTION AFTER SECTION OF THE LABOUR SOCIETIES REPORTED ITSELF ASSEMBLED REPORTED ITSELF MARCHING AND VANISHED FROM KNOWLEDGE INTO THE LABYRINTH OF THAT WARFARE
HE THREW HIS ARM FREE OF THIS AND FOLLOWED LINCOLN HE PERCEIVED THE GIRL IN GREY CLOSE TO HIM HER FACE LIT HER GESTURE ONWARD FOR THE INSTANT SHE BECAME TO HIM FLUSHED AND EAGER AS SHE WAS AN EMBODIMENT OF THE SONG
A DREAM SURELY THE FANCY OF A FANTASTIC VOLUPTUOUS WRITER HE BECAME INTERESTED CURIOUS THE STORY DEVELOPED WITH A FLAVOUR OF STRANGELY TWISTED SENTIMENTALITY SUDDENLY HE DID NOT LIKE IT HE LIKED IT LESS AS IT PROCEEDED
HOWARD'S FACE LIT WITH AN IDEA HE CAME TOWARDS GRAHAM AND SPOKE IN AN EASY CONFIDENTIAL TONE THE COUNCIL SECLUDES YOU HERE FOR YOUR GOOD YOU ARE RESTLESS NATURALLY AN ENERGETIC MAN YOU FIND IT DULL HERE
HIS EYES SEARCHED THEIR FACES THEY HAVE TOLD HIM NOTHING CRIED THE GIRL TELL ME TELL ME CRIED GRAHAM YOU ARE THE MASTER OF THE EARTH YOU ARE OWNER OF THE WORLD
I SHOULD BE TOLD WHAT IS HAPPENING YOU MUST WAIT REALLY YOU MUST WAIT GRAHAM SAT DOWN ABRUPTLY I SUPPOSE SINCE I HAVE WAITED SO LONG TO RESUME LIFE HE SAID THAT I MUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER
THE COUNCIL OH SAID GRAHAM AND AFTER AN EQUALLY INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT AT THE OTHER MAN WENT TO THE RAILING AND STARED AT THE DISTANT MEN IN WHITE WHO STOOD WATCHING HIM AND WHISPERING TOGETHER THE COUNCIL
THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
AND REGARDING SOME UNFAMILIAR THING IT WAS SOMETHING WHITE THE EDGE OF SOMETHING A FRAME OF WOOD HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THIS SHAPE
EACH MAN AT A LITTLE BENCH BY HIMSELF AND WITH A LITTLE SHADED LIGHT THE LONG VISTA OF LIGHT PATCHES WITH THE NIMBLE FINGERS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MOVING AMONG THE GLEAMING YELLOW COILS AND THE INTENT FACE LIKE THE FACE OF A GHOST IN EACH SHADOW
HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
OSTROG ALL HIS IMPRESSIONS WERE VAGUE SAVE THE MASSIVE EMOTION OF THAT TRAMPLING SONG THE MULTITUDE WERE BEATING TIME WITH THEIR FEET MARKING TIME TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE GREEN WEAPONS WAVED
BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
MINGLED IN THE RANKS TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMED MARCHING TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP HIS BRAIN WAS TRAMPING THE GARMENTS WAVED ONWARD THE FACES POURED BY MORE ABUNDANTLY TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
HER HAIR ACROSS HER FACE AND BRANDISHING A GREEN STAFF NEXT THIS GROUP AN OLD CAREWORN MAN IN BLUE CANVAS MAINTAINED HIS PLACE IN THE CRUSH WITH DIFFICULTY AND BEHIND SHOUTED A HAIRLESS FACE A GREAT CAVITY OF TOOTHLESS MOUTH A VOICE CALLED
OUR SOCIAL IDEAS HE SAID HAVE A CERTAIN INCREASED LIBERALITY PERHAPS IN COMPARISON WITH YOUR TIMES
WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
IT GOES LIKE THIS HE SAID IGNORING MY APPEAL HE THEN GAVE ME THE PROBLEM WHICH I HAND ON TO YOU A SUBALTERN RIDING AT THE REAR OF A COLUMN OF SOLDIERS TROTTED UP TO THE CAPTAIN IN FRONT
AND CHALLENGED HIM TO A GAME OF BILLIARDS FOR HALF A CROWN A SIDE THE LOSER TO PAY FOR THE TABLE HAVING LOST HE PLAYED ANOTHER HUNDRED DOUBLE OR QUITS AND THEN RODE BACK THE COLUMN BY THIS TIME HAVING TRAVELLED TWICE ITS OWN LENGTH
OUR HOSTESS HAD LAST AND MISSUS PETER HAD THAT ALL THIS BEING SETTLED OUR HOST WAS ADMITTED INTO HIS SMOKING ROOM AGAIN YOU BEGIN WITH ME I SAID AND I WAS PROMPTLY ASKED
SO TOBY AND I GO OFF TOGETHER UP TILL NOW HE HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME HE HAS BITTEN ONE COMPANY COMMANDER REMOVED ANOTHER AND LED THE COLONEL A THREE MILE CHASE ACROSS COUNTRY AFTER HIM
IT'S SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLATOONS THAT I FORGET ALL RIGHT WE'LL SAY THE SIXTEENTH WHY SHOULDN'T HE HAVE A HORSE OF ALL THE UNJUST WELL
IN ANY OTHER COMPANY CERTAINLY AT HEADQUARTERS POSSIBLY BUT NOT IN D COMPANY D COMPANY HAS A REPUTATION ALL I SAY SAID ROGERS
THE PROVERBS WHICH MISSUS HERBERT SUGGESTED WERE FULL OF MOSS WHAT ABOUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID MISSUS PETER THE ONLY DIFFICULT WORD IS MEND
RIGHT SAID HERBERT I KNOW I CAN DEPEND ON YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE MATHEMATICAL AND HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME I HAD MEANT TO DO A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK THAT DAY
AS SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FIELD FOR TWO HOURS A DAY TO THE BELOVED DICK SHE IS ALSO FULLY QUALIFIED NOW TO HELP WITH THE HEAVY ROLLER
I THOUGHT IT WAS CAMELS SAID CELIA CARELESSLY NO MOSS NOW IF YOU'D ONLY ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT GARDENING YOU SEE THE PROVERB WE WANTED TO HAVE FIRST OF ALL WAS
JANE'S BUSY AND I'M BUSY AND AND I'M BUSY I SAID OPENING AND SHUTTING A DRAWER WITH GREAT RAPIDITY JUST THREEPENNYWORTH SHE PLEADED NICE COOL ICE THINK OF SLIDING HOME ON IT
SO IF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING OCCURS BETWEEN US THERE WILL BE GOOD PRECEDENT FOR IT SO FAR MY ONLY REAL TROUBLE HAS BEEN ONCE WHEN BILLETING
AND I THINK I SHALL LEAVE IT AT THAT INDEED
HAS A YEAR OF MARRIAGE SO GREATLY CHANGED ME CELIA IT IS YOUR RONALD I SAT FOR THAT HOUR AFTER HOUR DAY AFTER DAY
SHE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND SLIPPED THE RING ON MY FINGER SPEND A LITTLE MORE SHE PLEADED THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM JUST HAVE SOMETHING NICE WRITTEN IN IT SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND ME LIKE PISGAH
THAT IS ALL I SAID FAINTLY AND WITH ALGERNON THE OVERWHISKERED CRUSTACEAN FIRMLY CLUTCHED IN THE RIGHT HAND AND STONEHENGE SUPPORTED ON THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND I RETIRED THE FLAT SEEMED A VERY LONG WAY AWAY
LEAVING ONLY THE WHISKERS VISIBLE AND GAVE IT TO ME THE ICE BEING NOW BROKEN I MEAN THE ICE BEING NOW WELL YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN I WAS NOW IN A POSITION TO ASK FOR SOME OF HIS ICE
AH THAT'S RIGHT THE ANSWER IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEN NO THAT'S WRONG I NEVER DOUBLED THE HALF CROWN ER OH LOOK HERE HERBERT I'M RATHER BUSY THIS MORNING I'LL SEND IT TO YOU
TOBY OF COURSE KNOWS MUCH MORE ABOUT MEN THAN I DO ABOUT HORSES AND NO DOUBT HE DESCRIBES ME PROFESSIONALLY TO HIS COLLEAGUES AS A FLEA BITTEN FELLOW STANDING ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOOFS
WELL OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE DONE I TOOK MY HAT AND STAGGERED OUT ON AN ORDINARY COOL DAY IT IS ABOUT HALF A MILE TO THE FISHMONGER TO DAY IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER
BUT THE SHOP HAS GOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN I TELL THEM AND I DON'T LIKE TELLING STRANGE MEN IN SHOPS PRIVATE AND SPECIAL THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES I LOVE YOU CELIA BUT
A WEDDING RING ENGRAVED AND I FELT IN MY POCKETS NOT INITIALS I SAID AND I FELT IN SOME MORE POCKETS BUT BUT I TRIED THE TROUSERS POCKETS AGAIN WELL LOOK HERE I'LL BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU
THERE WERE SEVEN OF US FOR NINE WORDS WE GAVE MISSUS HERBERT THE SECOND THE FEARING TO TRUST HER WITH ANYTHING MORE ALARMING AND IN ORDER TO KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY WE GAVE THE OTHER THE TO HERBERT WHO WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR BACK
I QUITE SEE THAT IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME HOWEVER
A NEW EXPERIMENT IS TO BE TRIED THIS SEASON AND SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO BOWL FOR AN ODD FIVE MINUTES AT THE END OF DICK'S INNINGS TO ME BOBBY ENTERS UPON THE COMING SEASON WITH CONFIDENCE
AND I TELEGRAPHED AN APPEAL TO CELIA FOR HELP SHE NODDED BACK AT ME HAVE YOU FINISHED ASKED OUR HOST GOOD LORD NO I SHALL BE HALF AN HOUR YET THE FACT IS YOU'VE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION YOU SEE I'VE GOT TO GET IN MOSS
BUT I KEEP ON MAKING IT EIGHT AND TUPPENCE JUST HAVE A SHOT AT IT THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I PROMISED THE GIRL YOU KNOW I SAT DOWN WORKED IT OUT HASTILY ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE AND MADE IT A YARD AND A HALF
HOWEVER I WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIM FOR I HAD JUST MADE IT COME TO THREE COWS IT IS A COW SHORT BUT IT IS NEARER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE
I HOPE TO REMAIN UNDER YOUR ROOF
I WANT THIS RING ENGRAVED I SAID CERTAINLY WHAT SHALL WE PUT I HAD FELT THE QUESTION COMING
STABLE DOORS OR FRYING PANS HOWEVER THERE IT IS AND I ENLARGED A LITTLE MORE ON THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING IN THESE DIFFICULT WORDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID OUR HOST FAINTLY WHEN I HAD FINISHED
WHAT SORT OF STUFF DO YOU BOWL ORDINARY SORT OF STUFF I SAID WITH ONE OR TWO BOUNCES IN IT
I AM SAID CELIA FIRMLY WELL HAVE YOU ANSWERED IT YET TO TELL THE TRUTH I'VE QUITE FORGOTTEN THE WORD THAT OH I REMEMBER NOW YES SHE WENT ON VERY DISTINCTLY AND SLOWLY
BILLETING IS DELIGHTFUL FUN
WHITE MATES IN FOUR MOVES I LOOKED AT IT CARELESSLY BLACK HAD ONLY LEFT HIMSELF WITH A PAWN AND A KING
SLOW THAT IS YOU KNOW WHEN I DO BOWL AT ALL I'M NOT QUITE SURE THIS SEASON WHETHER I HADN'T BETTER SLOW SAID DICK THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT
WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL SOMEHOW
AND LOOKED UP AND SAW MISSUS THOMPSON APPROACHING
I WANT LOTS OF THAT YOU MUST GET PHYLLIS TO BOWL TO YOU I SAID WITH DETACHMENT YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF LANCASHIRE MY DEAR MAN GIRLS CAN'T BOWL SHE FIELDS JOLLY WELL THOUGH
DO HAVE A SHOT AT IT THE ANSWER OUGHT TO BE EIGHT MILES AN HOUR LUCKILY HOWEVER SHE FORGOT TO ENCLOSE THE PROBLEM FOR BY THIS TIME WHAT WITH HERBERT'S SUBALTERN CAREY'S PAWN
NOT THAT THAT OFTEN HAPPENS I ADDED LOOK HERE
SUBALTERNS FROM OTHER COMPANIES USED TO CALL ROUND FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING FUNNY I SUPPOSE THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY I HAD BEEN TOO HUMOROUS ANYWAY THE TONE HAD BEEN SET
SOMETIMES I ADMITTED BUT SOMETIMES IF WE ARE VERY VERY CLEVER HE DOESN'T THAT IN FACT IS THE GAME OUR HOST GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR I THINK I SEE HE SAID
WE MIGHT TRY IT SAID CELIA DOUBTFULLY NOT FEELING QUITE SURE IF IT WERE A REAL PROVERB BUT COMETH WOULD BE DIFFICULT I DON'T SEE WHY SAID HERBERT ONE COULD ALWAYS WORK IT IN SOMEHOW
I TOOK UP THE SPORTSMAN AGAIN I SEE THAT KENT IS GOING TO THE PROSPECTS ARE ALL RIGHT SAID DICK IF ONLY I CAN GET INTO FORM SOON ENOUGH LAST YEAR I DIDN'T GET GOING TILL THE END OF JUNE BY THE WAY
ON THE DAY WHEN I FIRST PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER CELIA SWORE AN OATH THAT NOTHING BUT DEATH EXTREME POVERTY OR BRIGANDS SHOULD EVER REMOVE IT I SWORE TOO UNFORTUNATELY
IT IS RATHER A SHAME I AGREED BUT I CAN ALWAYS REFUSE OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ICE AND THE THOMPSONS ARE COMING TO DINNER
I DROPPED IN HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK I HAD A LIME JUICE THEN I HAD ANOTHER AND THEN
I TOOK IT FROM HER AND LOOKED INSIDE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS HERE TOO I SAID REALLY YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE READ YOUR WEDDING RING AT ALL OR ANYHOW YOU'VE BEEN SKIPPING
SAID BOBBY I BET PHYLLIS CAN BOWL BETTER THAN YOU IS THIS TRUE I SAID TO PHYLLIS
HIS PROSPECTS HOWEVER ARE CERTAINLY IMPROVED THIS SEASON AS HE WILL BE QUALIFIED TO BOWL FOR THE WHOLE TWO HOURS BUT ONLY ON THE DISTINCT UNDERSTANDING WITH PHYLLIS THAT HE DOES HIS OWN FIELDING FOR HIMSELF
LOOK HERE SAID HERBERT YOU USED TO BE MATHEMATICAL HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU LET THE DEAD PAST BURY ITS DEAD I IMPLORED I AM NOW QUITE RESPECTABLE
AND THE AMOUNT OF LIME JUICE CONSUMED BY CASUAL VISITORS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HIS HEAD DEFINITELY SMACKED FORTUNATELY IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION THE SEASON WILL BE A SHORT ONE
IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T RUN ANY MESS IN THE TRENCHES ON FOUR FRANCS A DAY YOU'RE A ROTTEN MESS PRESIDENT BLAKE TURNED DRAMATICALLY TO HIS COMPANY COMMANDER DID YOU HEAR THAT BILLY
YOU JOLLY WELL SHUT UP HE SAID TURNING INDIGNANTLY TO HIS SISTER JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT ONCE WHEN THE SUN WAS IN MY EYES BOBBY BOBBY I SAID THIS IS PAINFUL HEARING
WHATEVER'S THE MATTER DON'T YOU THINK HE'D DO IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CHEEK TO ASK HIM GOOD LORD
MEANWHILE HERBERT HAS FORGOTTEN BOTH THE PROBLEM AND THE GIRL THREE EVENINGS LATER HE SHARED HIS HOLLANDAISE SAUCE WITH SOMEBODY IN YELLOW AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
THE VISITORS BOOK SAID BLAKE
AND A DISTANCE EQUAL TO THE DISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED IF IT HAD BEEN GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION WHAT WAS THE CAPTAIN'S NAME PERHAPS I HAVE NOT GOT IT QUITE RIGHT FOR I HAVE HAD AN EVENTFUL WEEK SINCE THEN
HE MANAGED TO GET THE IN SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE BLOWING HIS NOSE VIGOROUSLY AND ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD FINISHED I BELIEVE HE'S PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME MURMURED CELIA TO MISSUS PETER
HE DIDN'T WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR HE ASKED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF CZECHO SLOVAKIA
HE SAID A MOUSTACHE SUITS YOU MY WIFE DOESN'T THINK SO I SAID FIRMLY I HAD THE WAR OFFICE ON MY SIDE SO I COULD AFFORD TO BE FIRM THE COLONEL LOOKED AT ME
LET X BE THE SUBALTERN THAT'S THE WAY I SAY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTERESTED IN PROBLEMS WELL BECAUSE I'VE GOT RATHER A TRICKY CHESS PROBLEM HERE I CAN'T DO HE PRODUCED HIS POCKET CHESS BOARD
AND FOR THREE DAYS CELIA WENT ABOUT WITHOUT A WEDDING RING AND FOR ALL I KNOW WITHOUT EVEN HER MARRIAGE LINES IN HER MUFF AND ON THE FOURTH DAY I WALKED BOLDLY IN I WANT I SAID
YOU'RE DETAILED YOU CAN'T BE DETAILED TO BE A PRESIDENT PRESIDENTS ARE ELECTED BY POPULAR ACCLAMATION
I LOVE YOU I REPEATED MECHANICALLY I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I WELL LOOK HERE PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO BACK AND GET THE RING ON THE NEXT DAY I WAS THERE AGAIN BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
I HANDED THE BOOK BACK TO BLAKE HE READ IT AND WITH ONE FOOT ON THE BOTTOM STEP OF THE DUGOUT I WAITED ANXIOUSLY OH I SAY DO STAY TO LUNCH HE SAID I GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AFTER ALL ITS REALLY MUCH MORE FUN HAVING CAMELS AND THINGS SAID CELIA IT'S THE LAST STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK
WHICHEVER YOU LIKE WHAT DO THEY USUALLY DO I ASKED WELL YOU'RE THE FIRST SO YOU'LL SET THE TONE FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T BE TOO FUNNY IT WAS AN ALARMING RESPONSIBILITY
I'M EVER SO MUCH OLDER NOW TALKING ABOUT WEDDING RINGS SHE WENT ON AS SHE TWISTED HER OWN ROUND AND ROUND SHE'S GOT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WRITTEN INSIDE HERS THE DATE AND THEIR INITIALS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
THIS HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME I LET IT SINK IN OF COURSE I SAID AT LAST ONE MUST CONSIDER ONE'S HORSE I QUITE SEE THAT WITH A BICYCLE
R BLAKE D S O BRIG GEN I HAD BEEN OUT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN QUITE ACCIDENTALLY I MET AN OFFICER OF THE BATTALION IN LONDON I WAS NEARLY A YEAR BEHIND THE NEWS AND BLAKE
PASS THE VISITORS BOOK AND LET'S GET IT OVER NO YOU DON'T SAID BLAKE SNATCHING IT AWAY FROM ME THAT'S FOR THE GENERAL THIS WAY SIR SAID A VOICE ABOVE
HOW MANY BLUE BEANS MAKE FIVE WHEN I HAD MADE A SUITABLE ANSWER INTO WHICH IT'S CAME WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY OUR HOST TURNED TO HERBERT HERBERT'S FACE HAD ALREADY ASSUMED A LOOK OF STRAINED EXPECTANCY
OH THANKS VERY MUCH I SAID AND I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE STEP IT WOULD BE RATHER I THINK PERHAPS WELL THANKS VERY MUCH ONCE BEGUN THE BOOK FILLED UP RAPIDLY
HE IS NOW GOING MANFULLY THROUGH BLEAK HOUSE A CHAPTER A NIGHT
WELL WHATEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S SEVENTEEN ALL RIGHT BUT LOOK HERE MY SON HERE'S A GOLF PROBLEM FOR YOU A IS PLAYING B AT THE FIFTH HOLE A FALLS OFF THE TEE INTO A POND
WE MUSTN'T HAVE LESS THAN SEVEN WORDS ONE FOR EACH OF US CAN'T WE GET SOMETHING FROM SOLOMON FOR A CHANGE SAID PETER A ROARING LION IS A CALAMITY TO ITS FATHER BUT THE CAUTIOUS MAN COMETH NOT AGAIN THAT SORT OF THING
WHILE WHITE HAD A QUEEN AND A COUPLE OF KNIGHTS ABOUT NOW I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT CHESS BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF CHESS PROBLEMS
AND A CISTERN LEFT ME BY AN UNCLE WHO WAS DINING WITH US THAT NIGHT I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME AND SO THE BUSINESS HAS GONE ON
I ARRIVED EXHAUSTED AND WITH ONLY JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO KNEEL DOWN AND PRESS MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE LARGE BLOCK OF ICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP ROUND WHICH THE LOBSTERS NESTLED HERE YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SAID THE FISHMONGER WAVING ME AWAY
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY IT MYSELF THEN IN THAT CASE I HAVE THE HONOUR TO RESIGN THE MESS PRESIDENCY
CHESTNUTS ROANS BAY RUMS I KNOW NOTHING OF ALL THESE I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A HORSE SIMPLY AS A NICE HORSE OR A NASTY HORSE TOBY IS A NICE HORSE
TOOK OFF SOME OF ITS MORNING POST AND WRAPPED ALGERNON UP DECENTLY THEN I SPRANG OUT GAVE THE MAN A COIN AND HASTENED INTO THE BUILDING BLESS YOU SAID CELIA HAVE YOU GOT IT HOW SWEET OF YOU
IDEAL BOWLING AND IN ADDITION THE WHOLE HEARTED ADMIRATION OF ALL OF US IN SHORT THE OUTLOOK HERE IS DISTINCTLY HOPEFUL PHYLLIS THE PROSPECTS OF THIS PLAYER ARE FROM HER OWN POINT OF VIEW BRIGHT
BIT SHE SAID REMOVING FRAGMENTS OF SHELL FROM HER LAP
FROM THE SHOPMAN HE WOULDN'T MIND BESIDES IF HE SAW US TOGETHER HE'D PROBABLY KNOW YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF A GOLDSMITH ARE YOU
IF YOU'LL BAR GUESTS
I HAD IT PUT IN AT ENORMOUS EXPENSE IF YOU HAD BEEN EIGHTEEN THE MAN SAID OR OR NINE IT WOULD HAVE COME MUCH CHEAPER BUT NO I WOULD HAVE YOUR EXACT AGE YOU WERE TWENTY TWO
THE MAJOR'S HORSE I CAN DESCRIBE QUITE SHORTLY A NASTY BIG BLACK HORSE TOBY
A PAINFUL BUSINESS ONE WAY AND ANOTHER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE LAST PAGE WAS REACHED WE MUST GET THE GENERAL FOR THE LAST PAGE SAID BLAKE DON'T BE AN ASS SAID ROGERS
I GOT UP SLIGHTLY REFRESHED I WANT I SAID SOME AND THEN A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME AFTER ALL DID FISHMONGERS SELL ICE PROBABLY THE LARGE BLOCK IN FRONT OF ME WAS JUST A TRADE SIGN
HE WENT INTO THAT LAST SHOW AS SENIOR SUBALTERN OF D BILLY WAS KNOCKED OUT PRETTY EARLY AND BLAKE TOOK ON
I DO WISH YOU COULD SOLVE IT FOR US IT GOES LIKE THIS AND SHE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN IT HERBERT DECIDED THAT THE SMALL PIECE OF MERINGUE STILL IN HER HAIR WAS NOT WORTH MENTIONING
HE WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS BROW HE ER THAT IS TO SAY ER LLOYD GEORGE YES IS THAT THE ANSWER SAID OUR HOST RATHER SURPRISED HERBERT EXPLAINED HASTILY THAT HE HADN'T REALLY BEGUN YET
I BELIEVE HE IS A STOCKBROKER IS ERMYNTRUDE'S HUSBAND AND WE PLAY OUR GOLF ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AND GO TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AND WELL
LET US BE THANKFUL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST GIRLS SCHOOLS LET US BUT BOBBY WAS GONE GOADED TO ANGER HE HAD PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND MADE THE GENERAL OBSERVATION RICE PUDDING AN OBSERVATION INOFFENSIVE ENOUGH TO A STRANGER
AS SOON AS I ARRIVED AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BOWL TO ME HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING TILL TO NIGHT I SAID QUICKLY ROT YOU'RE FIXED UP HERE TILL TUESDAY ANY HOW MY DEAR DICK I'VE COME DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS REST
WOULD BE TO BUY A PINT OR TWO OF LAUDANUM FIRST AND THEN HAVING ESTABLISHED PLEASANT RELATIONS
HAVE YOU TRIED LETTING THE QUEEN BE TAKEN BY BLACK'S PAWN THEN SACRIFICING THE KNIGHTS AND FINALLY MATING HIM WITH THE KING ALONE YES SAID CAREY THEN I WAS BAFFLED
THERE CAN'T BE MUCH ELSE UNLESS PERHAPS SHE HAS A VERY LARGE FINGER WELL I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING IN MINE SAID CELIA MOURNFULLY SHE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING RING AND GAVE IT TO ME
THE OBVIOUS CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON A NEWLY MARRIED FRIEND OF HERS THEY HAD BEEN SCHOOLGIRLS TOGETHER THEY HAD LOOKED OVER THE SAME ALGEBRA BOOK
I MUST LET YOU IMAGINE HOW THEY ALL MIXED THIS IS A BEASTLY WAR BUT IT HAS ITS TIMES
THE BATH MAT SHE SAID SURPRISED AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON IT
THAT WOULD BE A LOVELY THING SHE SAID CLASPING HER HANDS EAGERLY WHAT I LOVE YOU CELIA I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST DO YOU WANT ME TO ORDER THAT IN COLD BLOOD
WHATEVER THE PAPERS SAY IT WAS THE HOTTEST AFTERNOON OF THE YEAR AT SIX THIRTY I HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING AFTER MY THIRD COLD BATH SINCE LUNCH WHEN CELIA TAPPED ON THE DOOR I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME SHE SAID
THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS THE GREAT QUESTION IN THE MALLORY FAMILY JUST NOW IS WHETHER DICK WILL GET INTO THE ELEVEN THIS YEAR CONFIDENT AS HE IS HIMSELF HE IS TAKING NO RISKS WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE NET UP TO MORROW HE SAID TO ME
OR DEALING HIMSELF FOUR ACES PEOPLE WHO COME TO TEA BORROW A BOX OF WOODEN MATCHES AND BEG ME TO REMOVE ONE MATCH AND LEAVE A PERFECT SQUARE I AM ASKED TO DO ABSURD THINGS WITH PENNIES
I SAID SHARPLY YOU'RE MIXING UP SHOOTING AND HUNTING MY LAD AND IN ANY CASE THERE ARE REASONS SPECIAL REASONS WHY I RIDE TOBY REASONS OF WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING HERE ARE THE REASONS
I FUMBLED IN MY TICKET POCKET I WANT I LOVE YOU ON IT AND I WENT THROUGH THE WAISTCOAT POCKETS A THIRD TIME I ER LOVE YOU ME SAID THE SHOPMAN SURPRISED
WELL THERE YOU ARE SAID CELIA TRIUMPHANTLY LET'S PLAY PROVERBS I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT SAID HERBERT HE WOULDN'T OH IT'S QUITE EASY FIRST YOU THINK OF A PROVERB LIKE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE CERTAIN THEY HAD DONE THEIR CALISTHENICS SIDE BY SIDE THEY HAD COMPARED PICTURE POST CARDS OF LEWIS WALLER
OTHERWISE MISSUS MALLORY FACES THE APPROACHING SEASON WITH CALM IF NOT WITH COMPLETE APPRECIATION DICK
YOU ARE A SILLY ASS HE SAID IF YOU HADN'T INTERFERED HE'D HAVE DONE IT WELL I SHALL FILL IT IN MYSELF NOW HE TOOK A PENCIL AND WROTE MONDAY
THE NEXT THREE WORDS WERE DISPOSED OF EASILY ENOUGH A LUCKY QUESTION TO PETER ABOUT THE WEATHER GIVING HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFER TO HIS STRAW HAT IT WAS NOW CELIA'S TURN FOR BREAKS NERVOUS I ASKED HER
I LIKE TO THINK THAT HE SUMS ME UP TO HIMSELF AS A NICE MAN AT ANY RATE I AM NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR SPURS AND THAT MUST WEIGH WITH A HORSE A GOOD DEAL I HAVE NO REAL RIGHT TO TOBY
SO I SAID TO THE FISHMONGER I WANT SOME SOME NICE LOBSTERS HOW MANY WOULD YOU LIKE ONE I SAID
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BOWL SAID BOBBY RUDELY BOBBY IS TWELVE FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN DICK IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SMACK BOBBY'S HEAD BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT FOR HIM
I SAW THAT I MUST EXPLAIN IT TO HER AFTER ALL THERE WAS A DISTINGUISHED PRECEDENT COME INTO THE BATH ROOM A MOMENT I SAID AND I LED THE WAY SHE FOLLOWED WONDERING
AND WOULD DO IT PROPERLY THIS TIME I WANT THREE OF ICE I SAID WITH AN AIR
OR EIGHT PATIENCE SINGLES
OR PERHAPS HERBERT DIDN'T GET IT QUITE RIGHT OR PERHAPS THE GIRL WITH THE MERINGUE IN HER HAIR DIDN'T GET IT QUITE RIGHT BUT ANYHOW THAT WAS THE IDEA OF IT AND THE ANSWER SAID HERBERT OUGHT TO BE FOUR COWS
I INSISTED ON A CROWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER TO HAVE HAD A LION WHICH MEANS ER LIONS BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPARE MYSELF FOR I THOUGHT I WENT ON PATHETICALLY I QUITE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE A CROWN
HE SAID IT'S DIFFERENT AND SO THERE YOU HAVE THE SECOND REASON IF THE BOMBING OFFICER RODE TOBY I SHOULD SHAVE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THEN WHERE WOULD THE BATTALION BE RUINED
HE WRAPPED A PIECE OF DAILY NEWS ROUND IT AND GAVE IT TO ME
AND THAT'S WHAT I HAD ENGRAVED ON IT VERY WELL NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE NEXT TO IT A CROWN YES AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF ER CROWNS IT MEANS YOU ARE MY QUEEN
I HAD THE HONOUR OF OPENING IT I HAPPENED TO BE MENDING A TELEPHONE LINE IN THIS PARTICULAR TRENCH ONE THIRSTY DAY AND THERE WAS THE DUG OUT AND WELL THERE WAS I
IN THE HOPE OF GAINING A LITTLE MORE TIME HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION NO
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT A TREMOR BUT OF COURSE YOU SHALL PUT JUST WHATEVER YOU LIKE ONLY ONLY LET IT BE ORIGINAL NOT MIZPAHS RIGHT I SAID
THE BOMBING OFFICER I REMEMBER VOWED THAT MISSUS BLAKE'S HOSPITALITY WAS SO CHARMING THAT HE WOULD BRING HIS WIFE AND FAMILY NEXT TIME
BUT EVIDENTLY OF SUCH DEEP PRIVATE SIGNIFICANCE TO PHYLLIS THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO HEAD A PURSUIT INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY THE CHILDREN ARE GONE I SAID TO DICK NOW WE CAN DISCUSS THE PROSPECTS FOR THE SEASON IN PEACE
AND AN ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY LOBSTER I WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE STILL MORE MONEY IN TAXIS HOT THOUGH IT WAS I WOULD WALK FOR SOME MILES ALL WENT WELL THEN THE ICE BEGAN TO DRIP THROUGH THE PAPER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
HE KEEPS A VISITORS BOOK AH WELL SAID THE GENERAL GETTING UP
HE LIKES MOUSTACHES HIS OWN IS ADMIRABLE AND I HAVE NO WISH FOR HIM TO REMOVE IT BUT I THINK HE SHOULD BE EQUALLY BROAD MINDED ABOUT MINE YOU AREN'T REALLY MORE BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT IT
BUT I COULDN'T GET MY MIND OFF HERBERT'S WRETCHED PROBLEM HAPPENING TO SEE CAREY AT TEATIME I MENTIONED IT TO HIM AH SAID CAREY PROFOUNDLY
WE NEVER HAVE ANY NEVER HAVE ANY SAID BLAKE INDIGNANTLY THEN I SHALL KEEP A VISITORS BOOK JUST TO SHOW YOU SO THAT WAS HOW THE D COMPANY VISITORS BOOK WAS INAUGURATED
AND THEN HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT TOBY HE SAID GENTLY TO HIMSELF DOESN'T LIKE CLEAN SHAVEN OFFICERS
AND GAVE A FEW HINTS ON THE PROPER WAY TO MANAGE A HUSBAND RATHER SAID CELIA BUT IT DID SEEM FUNNY BECAUSE SHE USED TO BE OLDER THAN ME AT SCHOOL ISN'T SHE STILL OH NO
IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE JEALOUSY IF ONE OF THEM RODE HIM AND WHY WOULD IT CREATE MORE JEALOUSY THAN IF YOU DO ASKED ONE OF THEM WELL I SAID YOU'RE THE OFFICER COMMANDING PLATOON NUMBER
FLUNG ME THE REINS AND SAID
SIXPENNYWORTH I SAID FEELING SUDDENLY THAT CELIA'S THREEPENNYWORTH SOUNDED RATHER PALTRY
AT ELEVEN THAT NIGHT I ROSE FROM MY GLANCE DECIDED THAT HERBERT'S PROBLEM WAS THE MORE IMMEDIATELY PRESSING AND TOOK IT TO BED WITH ME
EMERGED FROM HIS APOLOGIES AND SWORE THAT HE WAS
IN AN HOUR AND A HALF SHE WOULD BE DINING WITH US ALGERNON WOULD NOT BE DINING WITH US IF ALGERNON AND MISSUS THOMPSON WERE TO MEET NOW
WHY ON EARTH SHOULDN'T I ASK HIM I HAPPENED TO TURN UP JUST THEN THE TELEPHONE LINE FROM HEADQUARTERS TO D COMPANY ALWAYS SEEMED TO WANT ATTENTION WHATEVER PART OF THE LINE WE WERE IN HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK
AND HAD TO CARRY ON ON OUR OWN BILLY WAS THE SENIOR COMPANY COMMANDER AND TOOK CHARGE OF THE BATTALION I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED AFTER THAT WE ALL GOT RATHER MIXED UP I SUPPOSE
WELL AS I SAY HE ASKED ME TO GO ON TO BOWL AND I TOOK FOUR WICKETS FOR THIRTEEN RUNS THERE GOOD MAN SAID DICK WAS IT AGAINST A GIRLS SCHOOL SAID BOBBY YOU KNOW BOBBY IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR IT
WELL OF COURSE IF HE ASKED YOU BY WHAT TRAIN COMETH THOU UP IN THE MORNINGS YOU COULD ANSWER I COMETH UP BY THE TEN FIFTEEN ONLY YOU DON'T GET THAT SORT OF QUESTION AS A RULE OH I SEE SAID HERBERT
BUT I SHOULD PREFER TO BE SENTIMENTAL IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGE THAN PLAIN ENGLISH I COULD ORDER CARS SPOSA
WELL I AM RATHER THIRSTY I SAID
BUT I KNOW NOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROSPECTS OF THE SEASON OR AT ANY RATE OF THE FIRST WEEK OF IT ARE
NOT WHEN YOU GET A GRAND SLAM SAID OUR HOST THINKING OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE EVEN THEN I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY LAUGHED PETER AND I WHO WERE PARTNERS ON THAT OCCASION ADMITTED THAT WE HADN'T LAUGHED
A BRITTLE ONE WHICH EXPLODED JUST AS HE WAS GETTING INTO IT
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT'S MIZPAH OR ICHABOD OR HABAKKUK I'M SURE THERE'S A WORD YOU PUT ON RINGS I EXPECT THEY'D KNOW AT THE SHOP BUT I DON'T WANT WHAT THEY KNOW AT SHOPS
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW STONES ONLY THROW WAS SO DIFFICULT ALMOST AS DIFFICULT AS I TURNED TO CELIA WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID JUST NOW OH YES CAMELS OR
IF IT REALLY MEANS THAT SHE TOOK THE RING IN HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT IT LOVINGLY AND WHAT'S THAT THERE SORT OF A MAN'S HEAD I GAZED AT HER SADLY YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THIS GAME AND YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF THINKING OF A PROVERB WHICH HAS NO MOSS OR STABLE DOORS OR GLASSHOUSES IN IT ALL OF THEM WORDS WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INCLUDE NATURALLY IN AN ANSWER TO AN ORDINARY QUESTION
YOU SEE WHAT RECRIMINATIONS IT WOULD LEAD TO NOW I DON'T SAY I'M MORE VALUABLE THAN A PLATOON COMMANDER OR MORE EFFECTIVE ON A HORSE BUT AT ANY RATE THERE AREN'T SIXTEEN OF ME THERE'S ONLY ONE SIGNALLING OFFICER
AND CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON ERMYNTRUDE I HOPE YOU DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I SAID ASKED TO SEE THE WEDDING RING AND ADMIRED THE CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE
BUT HE HAD BEEN KNEE DEEP IN MUD INSPECTING HUTS FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR AND WAS SICK OF BILLETING I NEED NOT DESCRIBE TWO HUNDRED LORRIES ON A DARK EVENING TO YOU AND SO SEEING THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUENTS
AND IF THERE IS A SPARE HORSE OVER WHAT ABOUT THE BOMBING OFFICER SAID O C PLATOON FIFTEEN CARELESSLY I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE BOMBING OFFICER OF COURSE HE IS A SPECIALIST TOO
BLAKE WAS ACTUALLY COMMANDING THE BRIGADE HE WAS SPLENDID SIMPLY ALL OVER THE PLACE HE GOT THE D S O
TO AVOID BEING SHOT WELL ANYHOW THEY RESIGN I SHALL SEND MY RESIGNATION IN TO THE ARMY COUNCIL TO NIGHT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE GAZETTE IN DUE COURSE
AS MAN OF THE WORLD SAID BLAKE STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT OF FIVE FOOT THREE AND SPEAKING WITH THE WISDOM OF NINETEEN YEARS I SAY THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE
HAVE YOU TRIED IT WITH AN X OF COURSE YES IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WANTS A BIT OF AN X SOMEWHERE
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER HIS BOWLING DAYS ARE RATHER OVER HE WAS IN THE ELEVEN YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO SO THERE'S REALLY NOBODY BUT ONE'S BOWLING DAYS SOON GET OVER I HASTENED TO AGREE
AS HE THINKS THERE IS A CHANCE OF MY BOWLING TO HIM TOO BUT HE IS MISTAKEN AS BEFORE HE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE HEAVY ROLLER AND HE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SLACKEN THE ROPES OF THE NET AT THE END OF THE DAY
I DOUBT IF EVEN IN ENGLAND WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR OFF YOU WILL FIND TWO PEOPLE MORE CONTENTED WITH THE MORNING THAN TOBY AND I
LEAVING IT ON THE PAVEMENT I CLUTCHED THE LOBSTER AND WALKED HASTILY BACK THE WAY I HAD COME BY THE TIME I HAD SHAKEN OFF MISSUS THOMPSON I WAS ALMOST AT THE FISHMONGER'S THAT DECIDED ME I WOULD BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN
WHEN I JOINED THE ARMY CELIA WAS INCONSOLABLE I BEGGED HER TO KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP TO WHICH SHE REPLIED THAT SHE COULD DO IT BETTER IF I PROMISED NOT TO KEEP A BRISTLY ONE
WHO'LL DO CAMELS YOU'D BETTER SHE ADDED KINDLY TO ME EVERYBODY BUT MYSELF SEEMED TO THINK THAT THIS WAS MUCH MORE FUN I'LL DO STRAW SAID PETER GENEROUSLY WHEREUPON CELIA VOLUNTEERED FOR BREAKS
WOULD SHE NOT BE EXPECTING HIM TO TURN UP AT EVERY COURSE THINK OF THE LONG DRAWN OUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER NOT EVEN LOBSTER SAUCE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE I DECIDED TO ABANDON THE ICE
LIME JUICE I'LL HAVE LIME JUICE THANK YOU SAID THE GENERAL AFTER CONSIDERATION BLAKE PRODUCED THE BOOK NERVOUSLY I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND HE BEGAN
IN THE SMALL SPACE ALLOTTED TO HIM THE SCULPTOR HAS HARDLY DONE ME JUSTICE AND THERE I ADDED IS HIS INITIAL R OH WOMAN THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT I SPENT ON THAT RING
A BURNT CAMEL SPOILS THE MOSS I EXPLAINED YOU MEAN A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE CORRECTED HERBERT CELIA CAUGHT MY EYE AND WENT ON HURRIEDLY WELL THEN SOMEBODY GOES OUTSIDE
ALL OF A TWITTER SHE SAID WELL CELIA SAID OUR HOST HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STAY WITH US OH A LONG TIME YET SAID CELIA CONFIDENTLY
IT WAS NOT NOR WERE CHILDREN OF TWELVE ALLOWED IN WITHOUT THEIR PERAMBULATORS
I HESITATED I ER WELL LADIES OFTEN LIKE THE DATE PUT IN WHEN IS IT TO BE
AND THEN HE ASKS QUESTIONS FROM OUTSIDE ASKED MISSUS HERBERT FROM INSIDE I ASSURED HER GENERALLY FROM VERY NEAR THE FIRE BECAUSE HE HAS GOT SO COLD WAITING IN THE HALL OH YES
I SUDDENLY BECAME NERVOUS ABOUT ALGERNON I COULD NOT TAKE HIM RED AND UNDRAPED PAST THE HALL PORTER PAST ALL THE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO MIGHT SPRING OUT AT ME ON THE STAIRS ACCORDINGLY I PLACED THE BLOCK OF ICE ON THE SEAT
AND HE LISTENED TO HER WITH INTEREST ON THE NEXT MORNING I HAPPENED TO DROP IN AT HERBERT'S OFFICE AND THAT IN SHORT IS HOW I WAS ENTANGLED IN THE BUSINESS
INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
EVER WRANGLING IN LAW COURTS IS LIKE SOME YELPING CUR THE SECRET SCHEMER TAKING PLEASURE IN FRAUD AND STEALTH IS OWN BROTHER TO THE FOX THE PASSIONATE MAN
AND THAT UNITY ITSELF IS GOOD ACCORDINGLY BY THIS WAY OF RECKONING WHATEVER FALLS AWAY FROM GOODNESS CEASES TO BE WHENCE IT COMES TO PASS THAT THE BAD CEASE TO BE WHAT THEY WERE WHILE ONLY THE OUTWARD ASPECT
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL
IS STILL LEFT TO SHOW THEY HAVE BEEN MEN WHEREFORE BY THEIR PERVERSION TO BADNESS THEY HAVE LOST THEIR TRUE HUMAN NATURE FURTHER SINCE RIGHTEOUSNESS ALONE CAN RAISE MEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HUMANITY
NOW THAT WHICH SEEKS TO SUBSIST AND CONTINUE DESIRES TO BE ONE FOR IF ITS ONENESS BE GONE ITS VERY EXISTENCE CANNOT CONTINUE TRUE SAID I ALL THINGS THEN DESIRE TO BE ONE I AGREE
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
TEN YEARS A TEDIOUS WARFARE RAGED ERE ILIUM'S SMOKING RUINS PAID
BRIEF DOTH FEEL FOR LO THE WHEEL STANDS STILL AND WHILE THOSE SAD NOTES THRILL THIRST MADDENED TANTALUS LISTENS OBLIVIOUS OF THE STREAM'S MOCKERY AND HIS LONG AGONY
WHY DO THEY ALL DRAW THEIR NOURISHMENT FROM ROOTS AS FROM A MOUTH DIPPED INTO THE EARTH AND DISTRIBUTE THE STRONG BARK OVER THE PITH WHY ARE ALL THE SOFTER PARTS LIKE THE PITH DEEPLY ENCASED WITHIN
FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE
CANNOT PROPERLY BE CALLED GOOD AT ALL WHEREFORE RIGHTEOUS DEALING
WHAT THEN OF THAT WHICH REMAINS WHICH THOUGH IT IS HARSH PUTS THE RESTRAINT OF JUST PUNISHMENT ON THE BAD DOES POPULAR OPINION DEEM IT GOOD
THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN
WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
AND THOUGH IN SUCH SORE STRAITS THE PITY OF THE GOD WHO BEARS THE MYSTIC ROD HAD POWER THE CHIEFTAIN BRAVE FROM HER FELL ARTS TO SAVE HIS COMRADES UNRESTRAINED
OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
UNTO THE CLEARER DAY IF ON THE DARKNESS PAST ONE BACKWARD LOOK YE CAST YOUR WEAK AND WANDERING EYES
BUT BY MEANS OF RATIONAL CONCEPTION
SHOULD BE GODS BY PARTICIPATION IN THAT NATURE A FAIR CONCLUSION AND A PRECIOUS SAID I DEDUCTION OR COROLLARY BY WHICHEVER NAME THOU WILT CALL IT AND YET SAID SHE
OF A THREE DAYS FEVER FROM ALL WHICH CONSIDERATIONS WE MAY CONCLUDE AS A WHOLE THAT THESE THINGS WHICH CANNOT MAKE GOOD THE ADVANTAGES THEY PROMISE WHICH ARE NEVER MADE PERFECT BY THE ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL GOOD THINGS
FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
THE FATAL GOBLET DRAINED ALL NOW WITH LOW BENT HEAD LIKE SWINE ON ACORNS FED MAN'S SPEECH AND FORM WERE REFT NO HUMAN FEATURE LEFT BUT STEADFAST STILL
BECAUSE ORDINARY SPEECH IS APT TO ASSERT AND THAT FREQUENTLY THAT SOME MEN'S FORTUNE IS BAD
MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
THOU BELIEVEST TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOUNDNESS OF KNOWLEDGE NOW THE CAUSE OF THE MISTAKE IS THIS THAT MEN THINK THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS COGNIZED PURELY BY THE NATURE AND EFFICACY OF THE THING KNOWN
IT WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOTENT THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH HAS EITHER THE WILL OR THE POWER TO OPPOSE THIS SUPREME GOOD NO I THINK NOT SO THEN
BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
WHILE THE EXTERNAL PARTS HAVE THE STRONG TEXTURE OF WOOD AND OUTSIDE OF ALL IS THE BARK TO RESIST THE WEATHER'S INCLEMENCY LIKE A CHAMPION STOUT IN ENDURANCE AGAIN
AND YET THE HEAVENS ARE NOT SO MUCH TO BE ADMIRED ON THIS ACCOUNT AS FOR THE REASON WHICH GUIDES THEM
WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED
OBSERVE THEN IF IN FOLLOWING POPULAR OPINION WE HAVE NOT ENDED IN A CONCLUSION QUITE PARADOXICAL HOW SO SAID I
CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
AND CHARACTER UNLESS THERE WERE ONE WHO HIMSELF ABIDING DISPOSED THESE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF CHANGE THIS POWER WHATSOEVER IT BE WHEREBY THEY REMAIN AS THEY WERE CREATED AND ARE KEPT IN MOTION
AND OF HAPPINESS AND DIDST TEACH THAT THE ABSOLUTE ONE WAS THE ABSOLUTE GOOD WHICH WAS SOUGHT BY UNIVERSAL NATURE
THE VULTURE TOO DOTH SPARE SOME LITTLE WHILE TO TEAR
THOU DIDST UNFOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF ASSUMPTIONS FROM WITHOUT BUT BY INHERENT AND PROPER PROOFS DRAWING CREDENCE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEN ANSWERED SHE FAR IS IT FROM ME TO MOCK THEE NAY
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
CAN YE EXCEL THE TIGER IN SWIFTNESS LOOK UPON THE INFINITUDE THE SOLIDITY THE SWIFT MOTION OF THE HEAVENS AND FOR ONCE CEASE TO ADMIRE THINGS MEAN AND WORTHLESS
DOST THOU THEN SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID NAY WHAT CONSEQUENCE THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERY FORTUNE IS GOOD FORTUNE AND HOW CAN THAT BE SAID I ATTEND SAID SHE SINCE EVERY FORTUNE WELCOME AND UNWELCOME ALIKE HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE REWARD
AND IF I HAVE ALSO EMPLOYED REASONINGS NOT DRAWN FROM WITHOUT BUT LYING WITHIN THE COMPASS OF OUR SUBJECT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR THEE TO MARVEL SINCE THOU HAST LEARNT ON PLATO'S AUTHORITY THAT WORDS OUGHT TO BE AKIN TO THE MATTER OF WHICH THEY TREAT
IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT THERE IS ALSO A HAPPINESS SUBSTANTIAL AND PERFECT MOST TRUE IS THY CONCLUSION AND MOST SURE SAID I NEXT
TH ITHACAN DISCREET AND ALL HIS STORM TOSSED FLEET FAR O'ER THE OCEAN WAVE THE WINDS OF HEAVEN DRAVE DRAVE TO THE MYSTIC ISLE WHERE DWELLETH IN HER GUILE THAT FAIR AND FAITHLESS ONE
OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
EXCEEDINGLY DO I REJOICE DEAR PUPIL THINE EYE IS NOW FIXED ON THE VERY CENTRAL MARK OF TRUTH MOREOVER HEREIN IS REVEALED THAT OF WHICH THOU DIDST ERSTWHILE PROFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I
IN HIS OWN BOSOM RAGED THE MUSIC THAT COULD CALM ALL ELSE BROUGHT HIM NO BALM CHIDING THE POWERS IMMORTAL HE CAME UNTO HELL'S PORTAL
WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
YET WITH THY LEAVE WE WILL COUNT IT AMONG THOSE
YOUR NETS YE DO NOT SPREAD UPON THE HILL TOPS THAT THE GROANING BOARD WITH FISH BE FURNISHED IF YE ARE FAIN TO CHASE THE BOUNDING GOAT YE SWEEP NOT IN VAIN SEARCH THE OCEAN'S RUFFLED FACE
SUCH THINGS HOWEVER MUCH FOREKNOWN ARE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE FREE
OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
PHRENZIED WITH RAGE WE MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE ANIMATED WITH THE SOUL OF A LION THE COWARD AND RUNAWAY AFRAID WHERE NO FEAR IS MAY BE LIKENED TO THE TIMID DEER HE WHO IS SUNK IN IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY
BUT THAT THINGS NATURALLY AIM AT CONTINUANCE OF EXISTENCE AND SHUN DESTRUCTION I CONFESS SAID I THAT WHAT I LATELY THOUGHT UNCERTAIN I NOW PERCEIVE TO BE INDUBITABLY CLEAR
OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
HOLD THE MEAN WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH WHATEVER FALLS SHORT OF THIS OR GOES BEYOND IS FRAUGHT WITH SCORN OF HAPPINESS AND MISSES THE REWARD OF TOIL IT RESTS WITH YOU TO MAKE YOUR FORTUNE WHAT YOU WILL VERILY EVERY HARSH SEEMING FORTUNE UNLESS IT EITHER DISCIPLINES OR AMENDS IS PUNISHMENT
THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS
WITHOUT DISMAY BESIDE THE LION LAY THE HOUND BY SONG SUBDUED NO MORE THE HARE PURSUED
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO BE DISSOLVED IN DELIGHTS OR ENFEEBLED BY PLEASURE YE CLOSE IN CONFLICT YEA IN CONFLICT MOST SHARP WITH ALL FORTUNE'S VICISSITUDES LEST YE SUFFER FOUL FORTUNE TO OVERWHELM OR FAIR FORTUNE TO CORRUPT YOU
TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD
SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
IF THEY WERE BUT WILLING TO WEIGH THEIR OWN CASE COULD THEY THINK THEMSELVES FREE FROM PUNISHMENT WHOM WICKEDNESS WORST OF ALL EVILS HAS NOT ONLY TOUCHED BUT DEEPLY TAINTED
THE GREAT BOAR'S DRIBBLED SPUME DID STAIN LAST TOIL OF ALL HIS MIGHT SUSTAINED THE BALL OF HEAVEN NOR DID HE BEND BENEATH THIS TOIL HIS LABOUR'S END THE PRIZE OF HEAVEN'S HIGH GLORY GAINED BRAVE HEARTS PRESS ON LO HEAVENWARD LEAD
THESE NEITHER LEAD AS BY WAYS TO HAPPINESS NOR THEMSELVES MAKE MEN COMPLETELY HAPPY
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE
THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
SO THEN THE PRIZE OF THE GOOD IS ONE WHICH NO TIME MAY IMPAIR NO MAN'S POWER LESSEN NO MAN'S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS TARNISH TIS VERY GODSHIP
OR ARE THEY ALL RELATIVE TO GOOD AS TO THEIR SUMMIT AND CROWN I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BUT I DESIRE TO HEAR HOW THOU WOULDST SOLVE IT WELL THEN LISTEN TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE MATTER
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
ALL MAY WIN ELSE HOW COULD YE THE ANSWER DUE
EVEN AS IT IS DESTROYED BY THINGS INIMICAL THINGS SOLID LIKE STONES RESIST DISINTEGRATION BY THE CLOSE ADHESION OF THEIR PARTS THINGS FLUID LIKE AIR AND WATER YIELD EASILY TO WHAT DIVIDES THEM
HAVE WE NOT SHOWN THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH MOST MEN DESIRE ARE NOT TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD PRECISELY FOR THIS CAUSE THAT THEY DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM ANOTHER AND SEEING THAT ONE IS WANTING TO ANOTHER
IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS
FOR A SIGN ONLY INDICATES SOMETHING WHICH IS DOES NOT BRING TO PASS THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE SIGN WE REQUIRE TO SHOW BEFOREHAND THAT ALL THINGS WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAPPEN OF NECESSITY
OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
AND WHEN IT HAD ONCE COME TOGETHER
ENGULFED HE WEPT THE PITEOUS SIGHT BUT BLINDED SOON AND WILD WITH PAIN IN BITTER TEARS AND SORE ANNOY FOR THAT FOUL FEAST'S UNHOLY JOY GRIM POLYPHEMUS PAID AGAIN HIS LABOURS FOR ALCIDES WIN A NAME OF GLORY FAR AND WIDE
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
WE JUDGE HAPPINESS TO BE GOOD DO WE NOT YEA THE SUPREME GOOD AND THIS SUPERLATIVE APPLIES TO ALL FOR THIS SAME HAPPINESS IS ADJUDGED TO BE THE COMPLETEST INDEPENDENCE
HOW GREAT IS NATURE'S DILIGENCE TO SECURE UNIVERSAL PROPAGATION BY MULTIPLYING SEED WHO DOES NOT KNOW ALL THESE TO BE CONTRIVANCES NOT ONLY FOR THE PRESENT MAINTENANCE OF A SPECIES BUT FOR ITS LASTING CONTINUANCE
WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
BUT WE HAVE PROVED THAT ONE IS THE VERY SAME THING AS GOOD WE HAVE ALL THINGS THEN SEEK THE GOOD INDEED YOU MAY EXPRESS THE FACT BY DEFINING GOOD AS THAT WHICH ALL DESIRE
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
ANY MORE THAN IT BECOMES A BRAVE SOLDIER TO BE OFFENDED
LIVES LIKE A DULL ASS HE WHO IS LIGHT AND INCONSTANT NEVER HOLDING LONG TO ONE THING IS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIRD HE WHO WALLOWS IN FOUL AND UNCLEAN LUSTS IS SUNK IN THE PLEASURES OF A FILTHY HOG
BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS
THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
THEY CANNOT QUICKLY WITHER AND DIE SOME SPRING UP IN THE PLAINS OTHERS IN THE MOUNTAINS SOME GROW IN MARSHES OTHERS CLING TO ROCKS AND OTHERS AGAIN FIND A FERTILE SOIL IN THE BARREN SANDS
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
BUT WHEN HEAVEN'S ANGER ASKED A LIFE AND BAFFLING WINDS HIS COURSE WITHSTOOD THE KING PUT OFF HIS FATHERHOOD AND SLEW HIS CHILD WITH PRIESTLY KNIFE WHEN BY THE CAVERN'S GLIMMERING LIGHT HIS COMRADES DEAR ODYSSEUS SAW IN THE HUGE CYCLOPS HIDEOUS MAW
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
THEIR ESSENCE IS ONE AND THE SAME THERE IS NO DENYING IT NOW DOST THOU KNOW SAID SHE THAT ALL WHICH IS ABIDES AND SUBSISTS SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES ONE BUT SO SOON AS IT CEASES TO BE ONE IT PERISHES
OR TRIAL OF THE GOOD AND THE PUNISHING OR AMENDING OF THE BAD EVERY FORTUNE MUST BE GOOD SINCE IT IS EITHER JUST OR USEFUL THE REASONING IS EXCEEDING TRUE SAID I THE CONCLUSION SO LONG AS I REFLECT UPON THE PROVIDENCE AND FATE OF WHICH THOU HAST TAUGHT ME
I QUITE AGREE SAID I TRULY ALL THY REASONINGS HOLD ADMIRABLY TOGETHER THEN SAID SHE WHAT VALUE WOULDST THOU PUT UPON THE BOON SHOULDST THOU COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSOLUTE GOOD OH AN INFINITE SAID I
EMERALD GREEN AND GLISTERING WHITE
CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
ALAS HOW WIDE ASTRAY DOTH IGNORANCE THESE WRETCHED MORTALS LEAD FROM TRUTH'S OWN WAY FOR NOT ON LEAFY STEMS DO YE WITHIN THE GREEN WOOD LOOK FOR GOLD NOR STRIP THE VINE FOR GEMS
SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY
AND THIS BEING SO THE WISE MAN CANNOT DOUBT THAT PUNISHMENT IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BAD FOR SINCE GOOD AND BAD AND LIKEWISE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT ARE CONTRARIES IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THAT
THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
THAT NOTHING HAS MORE POWER THAN SUPREME GOOD WE DID SAID I BUT THAT SAME HIGHEST GOOD CANNOT DO EVIL CERTAINLY NOT IS THERE ANYONE THEN WHO THINKS THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS NONE BUT A MADMAN
BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES
IS IT THY ENDEAVOUR TO HEAP UP MONEY WHY THOU MUST WREST IT FROM ITS PRESENT POSSESSOR ART THOU MINDED TO PUT ON THE SPLENDOUR OF OFFICIAL DIGNITY THOU MUST BEG FROM THOSE WHO HAVE THE GIVING OF IT
WILL RESTRAINS THAT WORK OF REPRODUCTION BY WHICH ALONE THE PERSISTENCE OF PERISHABLE CREATURES IS MAINTAINED SO ENTIRELY DOES THIS LOVE OF SELF COME FROM DRIFT OF NATURE NOT FROM ANIMAL IMPULSE
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
HE FED THE WILD STEEDS HYDRA OVERCAME WITH FIRE NEATH HIS OWN WAVES IN SHAME MAIMED ACHELOUS HID HIS HEAD HUGE CACUS FOR HIS CRIMES WAS SLAIN ON LIBYA'S SANDS ANTAEUS HURLED THE SHOULDERS THAT UPHELD THE WORLD
BY THE PURE FORCE OF THE MIND'S VISION WHEREIN THE MAIN POINT TO BE CONSIDERED IS THIS THE HIGHER FACULTY OF COMPREHENSION EMBRACES THE LOWER WHILE THE LOWER CANNOT RISE TO THE HIGHER FOR SENSE HAS NO EFFICACY BEYOND MATTER
FOR THE ONE TO WIN GLORY FOR THE OTHER TO PERFECT HIS WISDOM HENCE INDEED VIRTUE GETS ITS NAME BECAUSE RELYING ON ITS OWN EFFICACY IT YIELDETH NOT TO ADVERSITY AND YE WHO HAVE TAKEN YOUR STAND ON VIRTUE'S STEEP ASCENT
WHO FROM FALSE WAYS HIS HEEDFUL STEPS WOULD KEEP BY INWARD LIGHT MUST SEARCH WITHIN IN MEDITATION DEEP ALL OUTWARD BENT HE MUST REPRESS HIS SOUL'S TRUE TREASURE TO POSSESS
ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
FOR OFTENTIMES IN THE STRESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CHOOSES THE DEATH WHICH NATURE SHRINKS FROM AND CONTRARILY IN SPITE OF NATURAL APPETITE
THOU ART LURED ON THROUGH ALL MANNER OF HARDSHIPS AND THERE IS AN END TO THY PEACE OF MIND ART FAIN TO LEAD A LIFE OF PLEASURE YET WHO DOES NOT SCORN AND CONTEMN ONE
OF AN INTELLIGENT SOUL BUT OF THE DRIFT OF NATURE
THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
AND FROM THE LION REFT HIS SKIN THE FOUL BIRDS WITH SURE DARTS HE SLEW THE GOLDEN FRUIT HE STOLE IN VAIN THE DRAGON'S WATCH WITH TRIPLE CHAIN FROM HELL'S DEPTHS CERBERUS HE DREW
BUT LET US GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO THE TASK THAT WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES HAVE WE NOT COUNTED INDEPENDENCE IN THE CATEGORY OF HAPPINESS AND AGREED THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS TRULY WE HAVE THEN
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
IT MUST NEEDS BE THAT UNRIGHTEOUSNESS DEGRADES BELOW MAN'S LEVEL THOSE WHOM IT HAS CAST OUT OF MAN'S ESTATE IT RESULTS THEN THAT THOU CANST NOT CONSIDER HIM HUMAN
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
APPEAR ALTOGETHER LOATHSOME WHEN ALL ITS INWARD PARTS LAY OPEN TO THE VIEW THEREFORE
AND IF YOU TRY TO TRANSPLANT THESE ELSEWHERE THEY WITHER AWAY NATURE GIVES TO EACH THE SOIL THAT SUITS IT AND USES HER DILIGENCE TO PREVENT ANY OF THEM DYING SO LONG AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE ALIVE
HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT
LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
WELL IS THERE AUGHT SAID SHE WHICH IN SO FAR AS IT ACTS CONFORMABLY TO NATURE ABANDONS THE WISH FOR LIFE AND DESIRES TO COME TO DEATH AND CORRUPTION
NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
WITH WHAT SPLENDOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHINES WHEREBY IT IS MANIFEST THAT GOODNESS NEVER LACKS ITS REWARD NOR CRIME ITS PUNISHMENT FOR VERILY IN ALL MANNER OF TRANSACTIONS
THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
THOU DIDST MAINTAIN ALSO THAT GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE BY THE GOVERNANCE OF GOODNESS THAT ALL THINGS OBEY HIM WILLINGLY AND THAT EVIL HAS NO EXISTENCE IN NATURE AND ALL THIS
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
PROVIDENCE HAS FURNISHED THINGS WITH THIS MOST COGENT REASON FOR CONTINUANCE THEY MUST DESIRE LIFE SO LONG AS IT IS NATURALLY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE LIVING WHEREFORE IN NO WAY MAYST THOU DOUBT
SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
AND PLEASANT DELIGHT AND UNLESS THEY ARE ALL ONE AND THE SAME THEY HAVE NO CLAIM TO BE COUNTED AMONG THINGS DESIRABLE YES THIS WAS CLEARLY PROVED AND CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DOUBTED NOW
THEN SAID I WITH ALL MY HEART I AGREE WITH PLATO INDEED THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND FIRST I LOST THEM THROUGH THE CLOGGING CONTACT OF THE BODY
YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND
WITH GAZE ON EARTH LOW BENT THEY SEEK FOR THAT WHICH REACHETH FAR BEYOND THE STARRY FIRMAMENT WHAT CURSE SHALL I CALL DOWN ON HEARTS SO DULL
AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
HE BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO LOOK AT IT WHEN TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE SAW THE PORTRAIT OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT EXACTLY RESEMBLED HIMSELF
YOU MUST PRESENT YOURSELF AT THE PALACE OF YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM A PROOF OF YOUR OBEDIENCE IT DEPENDS ONLY ON YOURSELF TO CONDUCT THITHER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS EVER YET BEHELD
SHE LAUGHED WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE ENEMY WAS ON HIS WAY TO BESIEGE HER FATHER'S CAPITAL SHE LAUGHED HUGELY BUT WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THAT THE CITY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABANDONED TO THE MERCY OF THE ENEMY'S SOLDIERY WHY THEN SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY
NEXT DAY THE SECOND SON WENT INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM A CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF WINE AS HE ENTERED THE WOOD THE SAME LITTLE OLD MAN MET HIM AND BEGGED FOR A PIECE OF CAKE AND A DROP OF WINE
BUT THE BLOOD AND THE FAT OF THE ELEPHANT RUNNING INTO HIS EYES AND MAKING HIM BLIND HE FALLS TO THE GROUND AND THEN STRANGE TO RELATE THE ROC COMES AND CARRIES THEM BOTH AWAY IN HER CLAWS FOR FOOD FOR HER YOUNG ONES
THE SULTAN CONSENTED WITH PLEASURE ROSE UP IMMEDIATELY AND PRECEDED BY THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF HIS PALACE AND FOLLOWED BY ALL THE GREAT LORDS OF HIS COURT ACCOMPANIED ALADDIN THE NEARER THE SULTAN APPROACHED ALADDIN'S PALACE THE MORE HE WAS STRUCK WITH ITS BEAUTY
FROM THESE I HAD THE LIBERTY OF GETTING OUT INTO A DELIGHTFUL GARDEN IN WHICH WERE BATHS AND EVERY SORT OF COOLING FRUIT IN THIS PLACE
FOR HIM TO WASH HIS FACE AND HANDS AND AFTERWARDS TOOK OFF THE WRAPPING GOWN AND DRESSED HIM IN A SUIT OF CLOTHES OF STILL GREATER SPLENDOUR WHEN HIS DRESS WAS COMPLETE THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO AN APARTMENT HE HAD NOT YET SEEN
ONLY YOU MUST MIND WHO UNFORTUNATELY THE KING FORGOT WITHOUT INTENDING TO FORGET AND SO THE CHANCE FELL UPON THE PRINCESS MAKEMNOIT WHICH WAS AWKWARD FOR THE PRINCESS WAS THE KING'S OWN SISTER
WRETCHED MAN DO YOU NOT KNOW IT FOLLOW ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE SULTAN THEN TOOK ALADDIN INTO THE APARTMENT FROM WHENCE HE WAS WONT TO LOOK AT AND ADMIRE HIS PALACE AND SAID
FOR I AM HE A WICKED FAIRY HAD CONDEMNED ME TO KEEP THE FORM OF A BEAST TILL A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY SHOULD AGREE TO MARRY ME AND ORDERED ME ON PAIN OF DEATH NOT TO SHOW THAT I HAD ANY SENSE YOU ALONE DEAREST BEAUTY
WHEN SHE WAS TOLD FOR THE SAKE OF EXPERIMENT
AND TO CARRY ALL THEIR JEWELS BACK TO THE SULTAN AND TO THE VIZIER THEY UNDID IN A FEW HOURS WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SIX WEEKS ABOUT AND RETIRED LEAVING ALADDIN ALONE IN THE HALL HE TOOK THE LAMP WHICH HE CARRIED ABOUT HIM RUBBED IT
HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS ATTENDED UPON WHICH HE RETURNED TO THE HALL AND SHOWED THEM THE WINDOW WHICH WAS UNFINISHED I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO FIT UP THIS WINDOW IN AS GREAT PERFECTION AS THE REST
AWAY SHE WENT FLYING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER SCREECHING WITH LAUGHTER AND THE SERVANTS LOVED THE BALL ITSELF
HE RETURNED TO THE KHAN ON HIS RETURN HE HAD RECOURSE TO AN OPERATION OF GEOMANCY TO FIND OUT WHERE THE LAMP WAS WHETHER ALADDIN CARRIED IT ABOUT WITH HIM OR WHERE HE LEFT IT
BUT A SHUDDER WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE BABY ON THE CONTRARY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND CROW WHILE THE NURSE GAVE A START AND A SMOTHERED CRY FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH PARALYSIS
THE MERCHANT HAD VERY LITTLE APPETITE BUT BEAUTY THAT SHE MIGHT THE BETTER HIDE HER GRIEF PLACED HERSELF AT THE TABLE AND HELPED HER FATHER SHE THEN BEGAN HERSELF TO EAT AND THOUGHT ALL THE TIME THAT TO BE SURE THE BEAST HAD A MIND TO FATTEN HER
THE MERCHANT SUDDENLY LOST ALL HIS FORTUNE AND HAD NOTHING LEFT BUT A SMALL COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY UPON THIS HE SAID TO HIS DAUGHTERS WHILE THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS ALL THE TIME MY CHILDREN
BEGAN TO DIE IN GREAT ABUNDANCE THE GRIEF OF THE KING AT SEEING THIS COULD SCARCELY BE EQUALLED
THERE STANDS AN OLD TREE CUT IT DOWN AND YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING GOOD AT THE ROOT THEN THE OLD MAN SAID FAREWELL AND LEFT HIM THE YOUTH SET TO WORK AND VERY SOON SUCCEEDED IN FELLING THE TREE
I DESIRE YOU ONLY TO TELL ME IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE OLD LAMP NOW IS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CARRIES IT CAREFULLY WRAPT UP IN HIS BOSOM SAID THE PRINCESS AND THIS I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE HE PULLED IT OUT BEFORE ME AND SHOWED IT TO ME IN TRIUMPH
FOR IT WAS NOON AND THE DAY WAS SO SULTRY THAT THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WRAPPED IN NOTHING LESS ETHEREAL THAN SLUMBER ITSELF THE QUEEN CAME INTO THE ROOM AND NOT OBSERVING THAT THE BABY WAS ON THE BED OPENED ANOTHER WINDOW
WERE HUNG UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOME THIS HALL WOULD HAVE NO PARALLEL IN THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD AND YOUR PALACE WOULD BE THE WONDER OF THE UNIVERSE MY GOOD MOTHER SAID THE PRINCESS WHAT IS A ROC AND WHERE MAY ONE GET AN EGG
I HAD SCARCELY PLACED MYSELF IN THIS POSTURE WHEN ONE OF THE EAGLES HAVING TAKEN ME UP WITH THE PIECE OF MEAT TO WHICH I WAS FASTENED CARRIED ME TO HIS NEST ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THE MERCHANTS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR SHOUTING TO FRIGHTEN THE EAGLES
TO AFRICA THE GENIE MADE NO REPLY BUT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE OTHER GENIES THE SLAVES OF THE LAMP IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED HIM AND THE PALACE ENTIRE TO THE SPOT WHITHER HE HAD BEEN DESIRED TO CONVEY IT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
IN THE SUBTERRANEAN CAVE OR NOT AFTER HE HAD RESORTED TO A LONG COURSE OF MAGIC CEREMONIES AND HAD FORMED A HOROSCOPE BY WHICH TO ASCERTAIN ALADDIN'S FATE WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THE APPEARANCES TO DECLARE THAT ALADDIN
BUT YOU SHALL MAKE AMENDS FOR YOUR FAULT WITH YOUR LIFE YOU SHALL DIE IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE MERCHANT FELL ON HIS KNEES TO THE BEAST AND CLASPING HIS HANDS SAID MY LORD I HUMBLY BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD OFFEND YOU TO GATHER A ROSE FOR ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
AS SOON AS HE LIKED BUT SAID THE BEAST I DO NOT WISH YOU TO GO BACK EMPTY HANDED GO TO THE ROOM YOU SLEPT IN AND YOU WILL FIND A CHEST THERE FILL IT WITH JUST WHAT YOU LIKE BEST
ONCE UPON A TIME SO LONG AGO THAT I HAVE QUITE FORGOTTEN THE DATE THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD NO CHILDREN AND THE KING SAID TO HIMSELF ALL THE QUEENS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE HAVE CHILDREN SOME THREE SOME SEVEN
I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD BRING ME A ROSE FOR WE HAVE NONE IN OUR GARDEN NOW BEAUTY DID NOT INDEED WISH FOR A ROSE NOR ANY THING ELSE BUT SHE ONLY SAID THIS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT AFFRONT HER SISTERS
BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH THE FLOATING TAIL OF THE BABY'S LONG CLOTHES
AND AS HE WALKED QUICKLY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO RUN ONE BEHIND THE OTHER LEFT OR RIGHT OF HIM JUST AS HE WAS INCLINED TO GO IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THEY WERE MET BY THE PARSON OF THE PARISH WHO LOOKED WITH WONDER AT THE PROCESSION AS IT CAME NEAR HIM
AND ITS BRANCHES SO THICK THAT ONE HUNDRED MEN MAY EASILY SIT UNDER ITS SHADE THE JUICE OF WHICH THE CAMPHIRE IS MADE EXUDES FROM A HOLE BORED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TREE AND IS RECEIVED
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND I THINK MYSELF VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU HE THEN TURNED TOWARDS HER FATHER AND SAID TO HIM GOOD MAN YOU MAY LEAVE THE PALACE TO MORROW MORNING AND TAKE CARE NEVER TO COME BACK TO IT AGAIN
CLASPING HER HANDS THE QUEEN SAW THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND FELL DOWN IN A FAINT THE NURSE RUSHED ABOUT THE PALACE SCREAMING MY BABY MY BABY EVERY ONE RAN TO THE QUEEN'S ROOM BUT THE QUEEN COULD GIVE NO ORDERS
THAN ALL THE REST WAS A LARGE LIBRARY FILLED WITH BOOKS A HARPSICHORD AND MANY OTHER PIECES OF MUSIC THE BEAST TAKES CARE I SHALL NOT BE AT A LOSS HOW TO AMUSE MYSELF SAID SHE
BUT THAT IT WAS VERY DEAR UPON WHICH ALADDIN PENETRATING HIS THOUGHTS PULLED OUT HIS PURSE AND SHOWING HIM SOME GOLD ASKED FOR HALF A DRAM OF THE POWDER WHICH THE DRUGGIST WEIGHED AND GAVE HIM
AND PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE SULTAN WHOSE PRINCIPAL JEWELLER UNDERTAKING TO SPEAK FOR THE REST SAID SIRE WE ARE ALL WILLING TO EXERT OUR UTMOST CARE AND INDUSTRY TO OBEY YOU
BUT THE QUEEN PRETENDED TO TAKE IT ALL AS A JOKE AND A VERY GOOD ONE TOO
BUT IT HAS NOT SATISFIED ME A BIT I AM AS HUNGRY AS EVER AND MY STOMACH FEELS SO EMPTY THAT I AM OBLIGED TO BIND IT ROUND TIGHTLY OR I SHOULD DIE OF HUNGER
AS SOON AS THE KING CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE SAID TO THE HUNTSMEN FOLLOW THAT STAG ABOUT BUT DON'T HURT HIM SO THEY HUNTED HIM ALL DAY BUT AT THE APPROACH OF SUNSET THE KING SAID TO THE HUNTER WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE FAWN THE DAY BEFORE COME
BUT THE KING WAS ANNOYED AT THE THOUGHT OF GIVING HIS DAUGHTER TO SUCH A COMMON FELLOW AND TO GET RID OF HIM HE MADE ANOTHER CONDITION HE SAID THAT NO MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS DAUGHTER WHO COULD NOT FIND SOMEONE ABLE TO EAT UP A WHOLE MOUNTAIN OF BREAD
ATTEND YOU HERE YOU SHALL BREAK THE MAGIC SPELL THAT ON A BEAUTEOUS LADY FELL WELCOME PRINCE NO DANGER FEAR MIRTH AND LOVE ATTEND YOU HERE
SHORTLY AFTER HER DEPARTURE ALADDIN MOUNTING HIS HORSE AND ATTENDED BY HIS RETINUE OF MAGNIFICENT ATTENDANTS LEFT HIS PATERNAL HOME FOREVER AND WENT TO THE PALACE IN THE SAME POMP AS ON THE DAY BEFORE NOR DID HE FORGET TO TAKE WITH HIM THE WONDERFUL LAMP
BECAUSE THIS REQUEST DOES NOT COME FROM YOURSELF ITS TRUE AUTHOR IS THE BROTHER OF THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN YOUR ENEMY WHOM YOU HAVE DESTROYED HE IS NOW IN YOUR PALACE
OF GOD NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A LOFTY TREE FROM WHENCE I LOOKED ABOUT ON ALL SIDES TO SEE IF I COULD DISCOVER ANYTHING THAT COULD GIVE ME HOPES
HE WENT INTO THAT OF THE DRUGGISTS AND ENTERING ONE OF THE LARGEST AND BEST FURNISHED SHOPS ASKED THE DRUGGIST IF HE HAD A CERTAIN POWDER WHICH HE NAMED THE DRUGGIST JUDGING ALADDIN BY HIS HABIT TO BE VERY POOR TOLD HIM HE HAD IT
AND THE SOUR BEER INTO WINE AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK ENOUGH THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAID BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN KIND HEARTED AND SHARED YOUR DINNER WITH ME I WILL MAKE YOU IN FUTURE LUCKY IN ALL YOU UNDERTAKE
THE DECREE CAUSED SO MUCH DISCONTENT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE AFFECTION ALADDIN HAD SECURED BY HIS LARGESSES AND CHARITIES THAT THE SULTAN FEARFUL OF AN INSURRECTION WAS OBLIGED TO GRANT HIM HIS LIFE
AND THEN HE WILL BE SO ANGRY THAT PERHAPS HE WILL EAT HER UP IN A MOMENT THAT IS WELL THOUGHT OF ANSWERED THE OTHER BUT TO DO THIS WE MUST SEEM VERY KIND TO HER THEY THEN MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO BE SO
OH THAT'S NOT IT SOBBED HER MAJESTY IT'S MY CHILD MY CHILD WELL WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR CHILD SHE'S NEITHER UP THE CHIMNEY NOR DOWN THE DRAW WELL JUST HEAR HER LAUGHING YET THE KING COULD NOT HELP A SIGH
AND IN WHICH THEREFORE HE HAS COME OFF TRIUMPHANT IN FACT IT IS A GOOD THING ALTOGETHER TO BE LIGHT BODIED BUT IT IS A BAD THING ALTOGETHER TO BE LIGHT MINDED RETORTED THE QUEEN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO LOSE HER TEMPER
THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING WERE OF TRANSPARENT PORCELAIN VARIOUSLY COLOURED AND REPRESENTED THE HISTORY OF ALL THE FAIRIES THAT HAD EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THE PRINCE COMING BACK TO THE GOLDEN DOOR OBSERVED A DEER'S FOOT
THIS LAST ANSWER QUITE DISCOMFITED HIS MAJESTY WHO TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS COUNTING HOUSE AGAIN
SHE ACCORDINGLY ORDERED THE MOST CURIOUS FIREWORKS TO BE PLAYED OFF IN SIGHT OF THE WINDOW OF THE APARTMENT IN WHICH THEY WERE SITTING AND NOTHING BUT FESTIVITY AND REJOICING WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PALACE FOR THE PRINCE'S RETURN
EXAMINE THEM WELL AND MAKE ALL THE DISPATCH YOU CAN THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS EXAMINED THE THREE AND TWENTY WINDOWS WITH GREAT ATTENTION
THE PLEASANT TRICKLING OF A BROOK OVER THE PEBBLES WAS HEARD BY THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED IT AND THE BOY WAS JUST STOOPING TO DRINK WHEN THE SISTER HEARD IN THE BABBLING OF THE BROOK WHOEVER DRINKS OF ME A TIGER SOON WILL BE
SHE NEXT CONDUCTED ME TO THIS PALACE WHICH BELONGED TO MY FATHER AND GAVE ME A TRAIN OF CATS FOR MY ATTENDANTS TOGETHER WITH THE TWELVE HANDS WHICH WAITED ON YOUR HIGHNESS SHE THEN INFORMED ME OF MY BIRTH
THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS NOW BEGAN TO SHED TEARS AND TO LAY THE BLAME UPON BEAUTY WHO THEY SAID WOULD BE THE CAUSE OF HER FATHER'S DEATH SEE SAID THEY WHAT HAPPENS FROM THE PRIDE OF THE LITTLE WRETCH
AND ON THOSE DAYS ON WHICH SHE COMES INTO THE TOWN SHE DOES AN INFINITE DEAL OF GOOD FOR THERE IS NOT A PERSON WHO IS DISEASED BUT SHE PUTS HER HAND ON THEM AND CURES THEM HAVING ASCERTAINED THE PLACE WHERE THE HERMITAGE OF THIS HOLY WOMAN WAS
BUT ALAS WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS FOR THOUGH HIS PIECE OF CAMBRIC WAS EXQUISITELY FINE YET IT COULD NOT BE DRAWN THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE IT WAS NOW THE YOUNGEST PRINCE'S TURN
TAPPING HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS FOREFINGER I HAVE IT ALL I'VE FOUND HER OUT DON'T YOU SEE IT QUEEN PRINCESS MAKEMNOIT HAS BEWITCHED HER THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAY ANSWERED THE QUEEN I BEG YOUR PARDON MY LOVE I DID NOT HEAR YOU
BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE MADE A FALSE STROKE THE AXE SLIPPED AND CUT HIS ARM SO BADLY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO HOME AND HAVE IT BOUND UP NOW THIS FALSE STROKE WAS CAUSED BY THE LITTLE GRAY OLD MAN
SHE HASTILY BADE HIM ADIEU NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE SNOW WHITE HORSES CONVEYED THIS FORTUNATE PRINCE TO HIS FATHER'S PALACE WHERE HIS BROTHERS HAD JUST ARRIVED BEFORE HIM THEY EMBRACED EACH OTHER
AND SAW SUCH A FRIGHTFUL BEAST COMING TOWARDS HIM THAT HE WAS READY TO DROP WITH FEAR UNGRATEFUL MAN SAID THE BEAST IN A TERRIBLE VOICE I HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE BY LETTING YOU INTO MY PALACE
THE DISHES WERE OF MASSY GOLD AND CONTAINED THE MOST DELICATE VIANDS THE VASES BASINS AND GOBLETS WERE GOLD ALSO AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP AND ALL THE OTHER ORNAMENTS AND EMBELLISHMENTS OF THE HALL WERE ANSWERABLE TO THIS DISPLAY
PRINCESS REPLIED ALADDIN IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK IT WANTS SUCH AN ORNAMENT YOU SHALL SEE BY THE DILIGENCE WHICH I USE IN OBTAINING IT THAT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SAKE ALADDIN LEFT THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR THAT MOMENT
BUT THE MOMENT HE TOUCHED HER HE ALSO BECAME FIXED AND WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW AND RUN LIKE THE REST IN A FEW MINUTES THE CLERK MET THEM AND WHEN HE SAW THE PARSON RUNING AFTER THE GIRLS HE WONDERED GREATLY AND CRIED OUT
AND ONE OF THEM PRETENDED TO BE A NURSE AND AT LAST GOT THE MOTHER AND CHILD INTO THEIR POWER THEY SHUT THE QUEEN UP IN THE BATH AND TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HER AND THE OLD WOMAN PUT HER OWN UGLY DAUGHTER IN THE QUEEN'S BED
SO THAT MY FATHER IS LEFT ALL ALONE LET ME STAY A WEEK WITH HIM YOU SHALL FIND YOURSELF WITH HIM TO MORROW MORNING REPLIED THE BEAST BUT MIND DO NOT FORGET YOUR PROMISE WHEN YOU WISH TO RETURN
BUT THIS THEY TOOK CARE TO PREVENT SAYING MY LIFE SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR GREATER PUNISHMENT
SHE CONVERSED WITH HER UPON OTHER MATTERS BUT COULD NOT FORGET THE ROC'S EGG
MADE IT AS LIGHT AS DAY IN THIS ORDER THE PRINCESS CONVEYED IN HER LITTER AND ACCOMPANIED ALSO BY ALADDIN'S MOTHER CARRIED IN A SUPERB LITTER AND ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES PROCEEDED ON THE CARPET WHICH WAS SPREAD FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO THAT OF ALADDIN
AND GRIEVE FOR THE LOSS OF THEIR CARRIAGE AND FINE CLOTHES AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A MEAN SPIRITED POOR STUPID CREATURE OUR YOUNG SISTER IS TO BE SO CONTENT WITH OUR LOW WAY OF LIFE BUT THEIR FATHER THOUGHT IN QUITE ANOTHER WAY
NOT FAR OFF RAN A PRETTY STREAMLET LOOKING CLEAR AND BRIGHT BUT HERE ALSO IN ITS MURMURING WATERS THE SISTER HEARD THE WORDS WHO DARES TO DRINK OF ME TURNED TO A STAG WILL BE DEAR BROTHER DO NOT DRINK
THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN REGARDED NOT THEIR SCOFFS HOOTINGS OR ALL THEY COULD SAY TO HIM BUT STILL CONTINUED CRYING
STARING AND STAMMERING SHE CAN'T BE OURS QUEEN NOW THE QUEEN WAS MUCH CLEVERER THAN THE KING AND HAD BEGUN ALREADY TO SUSPECT THAT THIS EFFECT DEFECTIVE CAME BY CAUSE I AM SURE SHE IS OURS ANSWERED SHE
DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN THE DOOR WAS ONLY OPENED A LITTLE WAY AND QUICKLY SHUT BUT THE HUNTSMAN HAD SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM FULL OF WONDER WHEN HE RETURNED AND DESCRIBED TO THE KING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
AND IN THIS POSITION THEY WERE OBLIGED TO REMAIN BY THE GOOSE ALL NIGHT IN THE MORNING THE YOUNG MAN CAME IN TOOK THE GOOSE ON HIS ARM AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THE THREE GIRLS WHO WERE FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND HIM
MUST COMMAND ME TO BRING MY MASTER AND HANG HIM UP IN THE MIDST OF THIS DOME THIS ATTEMPT DESERVES THAT YOU THE PRINCESS AND THE PALACE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY REDUCED TO ASHES BUT YOU ARE SPARED
I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OFTEN HEARD MARINERS SPEAK OF A MIRACULOUS BIRD CALLED THE ROC AND CONCEIVED THAT THE GREAT DOME WHICH I SO MUCH ADMIRED
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OR HIS SERVANTS WILL EXCUSE ME FOR TO BE SURE IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW BEFORE I SEE THEM HE WAITED A GOOD TIME BUT STILL NOBODY CAME
THE PRINCESS OBEYED TO THE UTMOST HER HUSBAND'S INSTRUCTIONS SHE ASSUMED A LOOK OF PLEASURE ON THE NEXT VISIT OF THE MAGICIAN AND ASKED HIM TO AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE MOST WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
SINCE OUR MOTHER DIED WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE HAPPY HOUR OUR STEPMOTHER GIVES US DRY HARD CRUSTS FOR DINNER AND SUPPER SHE OFTEN KNOCKS US ABOUT AND THREATENS TO KICK US OUT OF THE HOUSE
THE HORSE TOOK A PATH ACROSS THE FOREST OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND IN A FEW HOURS THEY REACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HIS CHILDREN CAME RUNNING ROUND HIM AS HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE BUT THE MERCHANT INSTEAD OF KISSING THEM WITH JOY COULD NOT HELP CRYING AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
BUT JUST THEN BY CHANCE SHE CAST HER EYES ON A LOOKING GLASS THAT STOOD NEAR HER AND IN THE GLASS SHE SAW HER HOME AND HER FATHER RIDING UP TO THE COTTAGE IN THE DEEPEST SORROW HER SISTERS CAME OUT TO MEET HIM BUT FOR ALL THEY TRIED TO LOOK SORRY
AS THE WHITE CAT CONTINUALLY GAVE PROOFS OF AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCE WAS BY NO MEANS TIRED OF HER COMPANY SHE TALKED WITH HIM OF STATE AFFAIRS OF THEATRES OF FASHIONS
AM NOT I WICKED SAID SHE TO BEHAVE SO ILL TO A BEAST WHO HAS SHOWN ME SO MUCH KINDNESS WHY WILL I NOT MARRY HIM I AM SURE I SHOULD BE MORE HAPPY WITH HIM THAN MY SISTERS ARE WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
AND THAT THE BEAST LAY DYING ON A GRASS PLOT AND WITH HIS LAST BREATH PUT HER IN MIND OF HER PROMISE AND LAID HIS DEATH TO HER KEEPING AWAY FROM HIM BEAUTY AWOKE IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND BURST INTO TEARS
WE EMBARKED ON BOARD A GOOD SHIP AND AFTER RECOMMENDING OURSELVES TO GOD SET SAIL WE TRADED FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AND EXCHANGED COMMODITIES WITH GREAT PROFIT
WAS KINDLY RECEIVED BY THE HAPPY MONARCH WHO FORGOT THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AND TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION TO THE ROYAL CHAPEL WHEN THEY WERE ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE FONT SHE CONTRIVED TO GET NEXT TO IT AND THROW SOMETHING INTO THE WATER AFTER WHICH
AS ALL THE REST OF HER FACE AND PROJECTED OVER IT LIKE A PRECIPICE WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY HER LITTLE EYES FLASHED BLUE WHEN SHE HATED ANYBODY THEY SHONE YELLOW AND GREEN WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE WHEN SHE LOVED ANYBODY I DO NOT KNOW
ONE FINE SUMMER DAY A MONTH AFTER THESE HER FIRST ADVENTURES DURING WHICH TIME SHE HAD BEEN VERY CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PRINCESS WAS LYING ON THE BED IN THE QUEEN'S OWN CHAMBER FAST ASLEEP ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS OPEN
AND SO WHEN HE AGAIN HEARD THE HOLLOA OF THE HUNTERS HE COULD NOT REST OH DEAR SISTER I MUST GO ONCE MORE IT WILL BE EASY FOR ME TO AVOID THE HUNTERS NOW AND MY FOOT FEELS QUITE WELL
SAID THE GENIE I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE THAT HAVE THAT RING ON THEIR FINGER BOTH I
AND SHOW ME THE LITTLE COTTAGE SO THEY WENT TOGETHER AND WHEN THE KING SAW IT HE SENT HIS COMPANION HOME AND WENT ON ALONE SO QUICKLY THAT HE ARRIVED THERE BEFORE THE FAWN AND GOING UP TO THE LITTLE DOOR KNOCKED AND SAID SOFTLY
SHE LAUGHED AND DANCED ROUND AND ROUND HIM CLAPPING HER HANDS AND CRYING DO IT AGAIN PAPA DO IT AGAIN IT'S SUCH FUN DEAR FUNNY PAPA AND IF HE TRIED TO CATCH HER SHE GLIDED FROM HIM IN AN INSTANT
IN WHICH THERE WAS A FINE BED AND AS HE WAS QUITE WEAK AND TIRED HE SHUT THE DOOR
WERE WITH THE KING ASSEMBLED TO PASS JUDGMENT THE PRINCESS WHO ACCOMPANIED THE YOUNGEST PERCEIVING HIS THOUGHTS BY HIS COUNTENANCE
THE PARSON CALLED OUT TO THEM AND BEGGED THEM TO COME AND RELEASE HIM AND THE CLERK HARDLY HAD THEY TOUCHED THE CLERK WHEN THEY ALSO STUCK FAST AS THE OTHERS AND THE SIMPLETON WITH HIS GOLDEN GOOSE TRAVELLED WITH THE SEVEN
WE TOOK SHIPPING AT THE FIRST PORT WE REACHED AND TOUCHED AT THE ISLE OF ROHA WHERE THE TREES GROW THAT YIELD CAMPHIRE
THE GENIE APPEARED AND SAID
THE KING HEARING THAT EACH OF HIS SONS HAD SUCCEEDED IN FINDING WHAT HE HAD REQUIRED AGAIN BEGAN TO THINK OF SOME NEW EXPEDIENT TO DELAY THE TIME OF HIS RESIGNING HIS CROWN BUT WHEN THE WHOLE COURT
YOU WILL TREAT ME REPLIED I WITH MORE CIVILITY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER DO NOT BE UNEASY I HAVE DIAMONDS ENOUGH FOR YOU AND MYSELF MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER MERCHANTS TOGETHER WHATEVER THEY HAVE THEY OWE TO CHANCE BUT I SELECTED FOR MYSELF
WHY YES SAID SHE FOR I CANNOT TELL A STORY BUT THEN I THINK YOU ARE VERY GOOD YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED THE BEAST
AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS BOTH I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP I COMMAND THEE REPLIED THE MAGICIAN
PREPARED TO TAKE A HOROSCOPE AND ASCERTAIN HIS BROTHER'S PROCEEDINGS HE AS WELL AS HIS BROTHER ALWAYS CARRIED A GEOMANTIC SQUARE INSTRUMENT ABOUT HIM HE PREPARED THE SAND CAST THE POINTS AND DREW THE FIGURES
WHEN BEAUTY FIRST SAW HIS FRIGHTFUL FORM SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING AFRAID BUT SHE TRIED TO HIDE HER FEAR AS MUCH AS SHE COULD THE BEAST ASKED HER IF SHE HAD COME QUITE OF HER OWN ACCORD AND THOUGH SHE WAS NOW STILL MORE AFRAID THAN BEFORE
WITHOUT HAVING FALLEN INTO ANY WORSE SCRAPE THAN A CHIMNEY BY RESCUING HER FROM WHICH A LITTLE BIRD NESTING URCHIN GOT FAME AND A BLACK FACE NOR THOUGHTLESS AS SHE WAS
WHATEVER SHE WORE AS PART OF HER ATTIRE HAD NO EFFECT IN THIS WAY
AND IN A SHORT TIME FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PALACE HE EVER BEHELD
AND THERE HAVING OPENED MY BAG THEY WERE SURPRISED AT THE LARGENESS OF MY DIAMONDS AND CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANY OF SUCH SIZE AND PERFECTION I PRAYED THE MERCHANT WHO OWNED THE NEST TO WHICH I HAD BEEN CARRIED FOR EVERY MERCHANT HAD HIS OWN
AND SO RESPLENDENTLY LIGHTED WITH THOUSANDS OF LAMPS GIRANDOLES AND LUSTRES THAT THE PRINCE IMAGINED HE MUST BE IN AN ENCHANTED PALACE WHEN HE HAD PASSED THROUGH SIXTY APARTMENTS ALL EQUALLY SPLENDID
INDEED MY GOOD FAIRY SAID THE MERCHANT ALOUD I AM VASTLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND CARE OF ME HE THEN MADE A HEARTY BREAKFAST TOOK HIS HAT AND WAS GOING TO THE STABLE TO PAY HIS HORSE A VISIT
TO TAKE AS MANY FOR HIS SHARE AS HE PLEASED HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ONE AND THAT TOO THE LEAST OF THEM AND WHEN I PRESSED HIM TO TAKE MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF DOING ME ANY INJURY
FESTOONED WITH BUNCHES OF THE GAYEST RIBANDS AND THE LOOKING GLASSES REACHED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING THE PRINCE WAS UNDRESSED AND PUT INTO BED BY THE HANDS WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD HE HOWEVER SLEPT LITTLE
LIGHT OF BODY EVERY PART NEVER WEARY HUMAN ARMS ONLY CRUSH THY PARENTS HEART THEY ALL THOUGHT SHE HAD LOST HER WITS AND WAS REPEATING SOME FOOLISH NURSERY RHYME
ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES IN THE SAME ORDER AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT THE SULTAN HIMSELF CAME IN AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HER
SHE USED TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH READING PLAYING ON HER MUSIC OR SINGING WHILE SHE SPUN BUT HER TWO SISTERS WERE AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO TO PASS THE TIME AWAY THEY HAD THEIR BREAKFAST IN BED AND DID NOT RISE TILL TEN O'CLOCK THEN THEY COMMONLY WALKED OUT
ONE OF HER WOMEN TOLD HER IT WAS A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ABOUT THE HOLY WOMAN TO BE CURED OF DISEASES BY THE IMPOSITION OF HER HANDS THE PRINCESS WHO HAD LONG HEARD OF THIS HOLY WOMAN BUT HAD NEVER SEEN HER WAS VERY DESIROUS TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH HER
HE HAD SCARCELY GIVEN TWO STROKES ON A TREE WITH HIS AXE WHEN HE HIT HIS LEG SUCH A TERRIBLE BLOW THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIMP HOME IN GREAT PAIN THEN THE STUPID SON SAID TO HIS FATHER
AND SAW THESE VERSES WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE BOOKS BEAUTEOUS LADY DRY YOUR TEARS HERE'S NO CAUSE FOR SIGHS OR FEARS COMMAND AS FREELY AS YOU MAY
THERE WAS POSITIVELY NO DANGER OF LETTING HER FALL THEY MIGHT THROW HER DOWN OR KNOCK HER DOWN OR PUSH HER DOWN BUT THEY COULDN'T LET HER DOWN IT IS TRUE THEY MIGHT LET HER FLY INTO THE FIRE OR THE COAL HOLE OR THROUGH THE WINDOW
I FOUND THAT I HAD GAINED NOTHING BY THE CHANGE AS I WALKED THROUGH THIS VALLEY I PERCEIVED IT WAS STREWED WITH DIAMONDS SOME OF WHICH WERE OF SURPRISING BIGNESS I TOOK PLEASURE IN LOOKING UPON THEM BUT SHORTLY
GOOD NIGHT BEAUTY GOOD NIGHT BEAST SAID SHE AND THEN THE MONSTER WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AH MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE MERCHANT KISSING HIS DAUGHTER I AM HALF DEAD ALREADY
HE WAS STOPPED BY THE HANDS AND A LARGE EASY CHAIR ADVANCED OF ITSELF TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY AND THE HANDS WHICH HE OBSERVED WERE EXTREMELY WHITE AND DELICATE TOOK OFF HIS WET CLOTHES AND SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE WITH THE
DEAR LITTLE SISTER LET ME IN AS THE DOOR OPENED THE KING STEPPED IN AND IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT SAW A MAIDEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE STANDING BEFORE HIM
THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS AND SHONE BRIGHTLY INTO THE HOLLOW TREE SO THEY LEFT THEIR PLACE OF SHELTER AND WANDERED AWAY IN SEARCH OF WATER OH I AM SO THIRSTY SAID THE BOY
HE RETURNED TO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT AND WITHOUT MENTIONING A WORD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED SAT DOWN AND COMPLAINED OF A GREAT PAIN WHICH HAD SUDDENLY SEIZED HIS HEAD ON HEARING THIS THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD INVITED THE HOLY FATIMA TO STAY WITH HER
POINTED IT OUT TO THE KING AND THEY DETERMINED TO HUNT IT THEY CHASED HIM WITH ALL THEIR SKILL TILL THE EVENING BUT HE WAS TOO LIGHT AND NIMBLE FOR THEM TO CATCH TILL A SHOT WOUNDED HIM SLIGHTLY IN THE FOOT SO THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO HIDE HIMSELF IN THE BUSHES
UPON THIS QUESTION THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA SURVEYED THE HALL FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED IT WELL HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS AS FAR AS SUCH A SOLITARY BEING AS I AM WHO AM UNACQUAINTED WITH WHAT THE WORLD CALLS BEAUTIFUL
BUT THEY HAD TO TAKE SOME CARE HOW THEY THREW HER FOR IF SHE RECEIVED AN UPWARD DIRECTION SHE WOULD NEVER COME DOWN AGAIN WITHOUT BEING FETCHED
HE RAN TO THE BEDSIDE AND KISSED HER A HUNDRED TIMES AT LAST BEAUTY BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT NO CLOTHES WITH HER TO PUT ON BUT THE SERVANT TOLD HER SHE HAD JUST FOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM A LARGE CHEST FULL OF DRESSES TRIMMED ALL OVER WITH GOLD
YOU MUST UNDERTAKE ANOTHER EXPEDITION AND WHICHEVER BY THE END OF A YEAR BRINGS ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY SHALL MARRY HER
DID NOT LONG EXCUSE HIMSELF FROM ACCEPTING THE OBLIGING OFFER WHICH THE PRINCESS MADE HIM PRINCESS SAID HE WHATEVER RESOLUTION A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN AS I AM MAY HAVE MADE TO RENOUNCE THE POMP AND GRANDEUR OF THIS WORLD
WHILE BEAUTY WAS DRESSING HERSELF A SERVANT BROUGHT WORD TO HER THAT HER SISTERS WERE COME WITH THEIR HUSBANDS TO PAY HER A VISIT THEY BOTH LIVED UNHAPPILY WITH THE GENTLEMEN THEY HAD MARRIED THE HUSBAND OF THE ELDEST WAS VERY HANDSOME BUT WAS SO VERY PROUD OF THIS
THE WHITE CAT WHO KNEW THE VERY DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS TO REACH HIS FATHER'S PALACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE HAD BUT THREE DAYS LONGER TO LOOK FOR A PERFECT LITTLE DOG THE PRINCE ASTONISHED AT HIS OWN FORGETFULNESS BEGAN TO AFFLICT HIMSELF
AND TAKE FROM HER LIPS THE KISS WHICH HOVERED ON THEM LIKE A BUTTERFLY ON A ROSEBUD WHEN A PUFF OF WIND BLEW HER ASIDE INTO THE ARMS OF A YOUNG PAGE WHO HAD JUST BEEN RECEIVING A MESSAGE FROM HIS MAJESTY
NIGHT SUDDENLY CAME ON AND WITH IT A VIOLENT STORM OF THUNDER LIGHTNING AND RAIN TO ADD TO HIS PERPLEXITY HE LOST HIS PATH AND COULD FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE FOREST AFTER HE HAD GROPED ABOUT
AND IN THE MORNING WAS AWAKED BY A CONFUSED NOISE THE HANDS TOOK HIM OUT OF BED AND PUT ON HIM A HANDSOME HUNTING JACKET HE LOOKED INTO THE COURT YARD AND PERCEIVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CATS
THE MAGICIAN WENT AT NIGHT AND PLUNGING A PONIARD INTO HER HEART KILLED THIS GOOD WOMAN IN THE MORNING HE DYED HIS FACE OF THE SAME HUE AS HERS AND ARRAYING HIMSELF IN HER GARB TAKING HER VEIL
IS THE BROTHER OF THE MAGICIAN WHO ATTEMPTED OUR RUIN HE HAS STRANGLED THE TRUE FATIMA AND DISGUISED HIMSELF IN HER CLOTHES WITH INTENT TO MURDER ME ALADDIN THEN INFORMED HER HOW THE GENIE HAD TOLD HIM THESE FACTS
NOT TO SAY KINGS AND QUEENS AND THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE FORM DUPLICITY CAN ASSUME IS THAT OF PUNNING THERE SAID THE QUEEN I NEVER MADE A JEST BUT I BROKE IT IN THE MAKING I AM THE MOST
TO SEE AN OLD MAN WITH A BASKET ON HIS ARM FULL OF FINE NEW LAMPS ASKING TO CHANGE THEM FOR OLD ONES THE CHILDREN AND MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY STIR MAKE ALL THE NOISE THEY CAN IN DERISION OF HIM
THE SOUNDING HORN THE BARKING OF THE DOGS THE HOLLOA OF THE HUNTSMEN RESOUNDED THROUGH THE FOREST AND WERE HEARD BY THE STAG WHO BECAME EAGER TO JOIN HIS COMPANIONS OH DEAR HE SAID DO LET ME GO AND SEE THE HUNT
BY HOLDING ON THE ROCK TO SAVE HIMSELF THAT IMMEDIATELY
NO MY PRINCESS ANSWERED ALADDIN WITH EMOTION I HAVE NOT KILLED FATIMA BUT A VILLAIN WHO WOULD HAVE ASSASSINATED ME IF I HAD NOT PREVENTED HIM THIS WICKED MAN ADDED HE UNCOVERING HIS FACE
INTIMATED HIS SUSPICION THAT THE PALACE WAS BUILT BY MAGIC AND THAT ALADDIN HAD MADE HIS HUNTING EXCURSION AN EXCUSE FOR THE REMOVAL OF HIS PALACE WITH THE SAME SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN ERECTED
WHICH HE ATE OUT OF HER HAND AND THE POOR LITTLE ANIMAL WENT OUT WITH HER AND PLAYED ABOUT AS HAPPY AS THE DAY WAS LONG WHEN EVENING CAME AND THE POOR SISTER FELT TIRED
ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF MY TOWER OVERLOOKED A LONG AVENUE SHADED WITH TREES SO THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN IN IT A HUMAN CREATURE ONE DAY HOWEVER AS I WAS TALKING AT THIS WINDOW WITH MY PARROT
AND THE YOUNGEST REMOUNTED HIS WOODEN HORSE AND IN A SHORT TIME ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF HIS BELOVED WHITE CAT WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH THE GREATEST JOY WHILE THE TRUNKLESS HANDS HELPED HIM TO DISMOUNT AND PROVIDED HIM WITH IMMEDIATE REFRESHMENTS
AND BEFORE EVENING THE WHOLE PILE HAD DISAPPEARED THEN THE SIMPLETON WENT A THIRD TIME TO THE KING AND ASKED FOR HIS BRIDE BUT THE KING MADE SEVERAL EXCUSES AND AT LAST SAID THAT IF HE COULD BRING HIM A SHIP THAT WOULD TRAVEL AS WELL BY LAND AS BY WATER
ON HER ARRIVAL ALADDIN WAS READY TO RECEIVE HER AT THE ENTRANCE AND LED HER INTO A LARGE HALL ILLUMINATED WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAX CANDLES WHERE A NOBLE FEAST WAS SERVED UP
MAGNIFICENTLY FURNISHED THERE WAS IN IT A TABLE SPREAD FOR A REPAST AND EVERYTHING UPON IT WAS OF THE PUREST GOLD ADORNED WITH JEWELS THE PRINCE OBSERVED THERE WERE TWO COVERS SET AND WAS WONDERING
AND BEFORE HE LEFT HOME HIS MOTHER PREPARED BEAUTIFUL PANCAKES AND A BOTTLE OF WINE FOR HIM TO TAKE WITH HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT SUFFER FROM HUNGER OR THIRST AS HE ENTERED THE FOREST HE MET A GRAY OLD MAN WHO BADE HIM GOOD MORNING
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THE JOY OF BOTH AT SEEING EACH OTHER AFTER SO CRUEL A SEPARATION AFTER EMBRACING AND SHEDDING TEARS OF JOY THEY SAT DOWN AND ALADDIN SAID
IN SHORT DEAR PRINCE CONTINUED THE LADY MY MOTHER INSTANTLY GOT OUT OF BED WAS DRESSED BY HER ATTENDANTS ENTERED THE PALACE AND SATISFIED HER LONGING
AND WILL THEN TELL YOU WHAT MUST BE DONE BY YOU TO INSURE SUCCESS IN THE MEAN TIME I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF AND BEG THAT THE PRIVATE DOOR MAY BE OPENED AT THE FIRST KNOCK WHEN ALADDIN WAS OUT OF THE PALACE HE LOOKED ROUND HIM ON ALL SIDES AND PERCEIVING A PEASANT GOING INTO THE COUNTRY
WHY IF I DID I SHOULD HAVE NONE FOR MYSELF NOT I INDEED SO TAKE YOURSELF OFF AND HE LEFT THE MAN STANDING AND WENT ON THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN CUTTING DOWN A TREE
WHAT WONDERS CAN BE DONE IN ONLY ONE NIGHT ALADDIN ON HIS BEING CONVEYED BY THE GENIE TO HIS OWN HOME REQUESTED HIS MOTHER TO GO TO THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR AND TELL HER THAT THE PALACE WOULD BE READY FOR HER RECEPTION IN THE EVENING SHE WENT
I COMMAND THEE IN THE NAME OF THIS LAMP BRING A ROC'S EGG TO BE HUNG UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOME OF THE HALL OF THE PALACE ALADDIN HAD NO SOONER PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS THAN THE HALL SHOOK AS IF READY TO FALL
RUBIES AND EMERALDS SO THAT THEY SHALL EXCEED EVERYTHING OF THE KIND EVER SEEN IN THE WORLD LET THERE BE AN INNER AND OUTER COURT IN FRONT OF THE PALACE AND A SPACIOUS GARDEN BUT ABOVE ALL THINGS PROVIDE A SAFE TREASURE HOUSE
THE PRINCE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HIS COUNTRY AND RELATIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN REGRETTED THAT HE WAS NOT A CAT SO GREAT WAS HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS MEWING COMPANIONS ALAS SAID HE TO THE WHITE CAT
THEY REACHED THE PALACE IN A VERY FEW HOURS AND THE HORSE WITHOUT BIDDING WENT INTO THE SAME STABLE AS BEFORE THE MERCHANT AND BEAUTY WALKED TOWARDS THE LARGE HALL WHERE THEY FOUND A TABLE COVERED WITH EVERY DAINTY AND TWO PLATES LAID READY
THEY WILL NOT HUNT ME UNLESS THEY SEE ME RUNNING AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THAT BUT HIS SISTER WEPT AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO IF THEY KILL YOU DEAR FAWN I SHALL BE HERE ALONE IN THE FOREST FORSAKEN BY THE WHOLE WORLD
BUT THE SECOND SON ANSWERED RUDELY WHAT I MIGHT GIVE TO YOU I SHALL WANT MYSELF SO BE OFF THEN HE LEFT THE LITTLE OLD MAN STANDING IN THE ROAD AND WALKED ON HIS PUNISHMENT SOON CAME
THIS AT FIRST ALARMED ME BUT THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION HAD RESTORED ME TO TRANQUILLITY WHEN ALL AT ONCE THE WINDOW OPENED AND THE FAIRY VIOLENT MOUNTED ON THE DRAGON'S BACK RUSHED INTO THE TOWER
WHEN YOU MUST GIVE HIM THE CUP CONTAINING THIS POWDER ON DRINKING IT HE WILL INSTANTLY FALL ASLEEP AND WE WILL OBTAIN THE LAMP WHOSE SLAVES WILL DO ALL OUR BIDDING AND RESTORE US AND THE PALACE TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA
THEY ACCORDINGLY BEGAN TO DISPUTE WHEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCE TAKING HIS ACORN FROM HIS POCKET SOON ENDED THEIR CONTENTION FOR A LITTLE DOG APPEARED WHICH COULD WITH EASE GO THROUGH THE SMALLEST RING
WHEN HE REACHED THE WOOD THE VERY SAME LITTLE OLD MAN MET HIM AND AFTER GREETING HIM KINDLY SAID GIVE ME A LITTLE OF YOUR CAKE AND A DROP FROM YOUR BOTTLE FOR I AM VERY HUNGRY AND THIRSTY OH REPLIED THE SIMPLE YOUTH
NEITHER OF THEM CARES FOR STRENUOUS SPORTS THE FAT MAN DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY ON HIS FEET THE CEREBRAL DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY AT THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY

DEPENDENCE IS BRED OF NECESSITY
SO MANY A CEREBRAL WHO DOES LITTLE TALKING OUTSIDE HIS INTIMATE CIRCLE DOES A GOOD DEAL OF SURREPTITIOUS WRITING IT MAY BE ONLY THE KEEPING OF A DIARY JOTTING DOWN MEMORANDA OR WRITING LONG LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS BUT HE WILL WRITE SOMETHING
THAN ANY OTHER TWO TYPES COMBINED IN EVERYTHING SAVE ACROBATICS AND ORATORY HE HOLDS THE PLATFORM LAURELS AS ALREADY POINTED OUT HIS ADAPTABILITY SPONTANEITY AND LOVE OF APPROVAL
IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN HANGING THE SCREEN DOOR CHOPPING THE WOOD OR DUSTING THE FURNITURE BUT IT WILL FURNISH HIM WITH SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY BECAUSE HE ENJOYS ACTION FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND BECAUSE WORK IS ONLY APPLIED ACTION THIS TYPE MAKES THE BEST WORKER
THAT HE IS SOON READY FOR THE NEXT HE HAS FEWER COMPLEXES THAN ANY OTHER TYPE BECAUSE HE DOES NOT INHIBIT AS MUCH THE UNCORKED BOTTLE
BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO PURCHASE MORE THAN THE MOST LIMITED QUANTITIES OF THE PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE ABOUT CLOTHES CLOTHES ARE ALMOST THE LAST THING THE CEREBRAL THINKS ABOUT
AND A QUARREL COMES BETWEEN YOU HE MAY BE EVER SO BITTER AND BITING IN THE MOMENT OF HIS ANGER BUT IN MOST CASES HE WILL FORGIVE YOU EVENTUALLY REALLY FORGETS DISAGREEMENTS IT IS NOT AS EASY FOR OTHER TYPES TO FORGIVE
OR MOSTLY MUSCLE BECAUSE FAT IS ALWAYS ROUND AND SOFT WHILE MUSCLE IS FIRM AND DEFINITE PHYSICAL SOLIDITY A GENERAL SOLIDITY OF STRUCTURE
WILL HIMSELF BE A HAZY MYTH AND WHEN SOCIETY IDLERS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO EARN THEIR LIVINGS THE WORLD'S PATHFINDER THE CEREBRAL THEREFORE LEADS THE WORLD IN IDEAS
HE PREFERS STAYING AT THE SAME JOB WITH CONGENIAL ASSOCIATES TO FINDING ANOTHER EVEN IF IT PAID MORE VERY OFTEN POOR SINCE WE GET ONLY WHAT WE GO AFTER IN THIS WORLD IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CEREBRAL IS OFTEN POOR
BEING OVER EQUIPPED FOR IT KEEP URGING HIM FROM WITHIN TO DO THINGS
EVERYTHING IN HIS ORGANISM TENDS TO SUDDENNESS AND NOT TO SAMENESS JUST AS HE IS INCLINED TO GET INTO AND OUT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCES QUICKLY SO HE IS INCLINED TO SUDDEN ILLNESSES AND TO SUDDEN RECUPERATIONS
BUT THE CEREBRAL IS BORN OLD FROM INFANCY HE SHOWS MORE MATURITY THAN OTHER CHILDREN THE TEACHER'S PET HIS STUDIOUSNESS AND TRACTABLENESS LEAD TO ONE REWARD IN CHILDHOOD THOUGH IT OFTEN COSTS HIM DEAR AS A MAN
THE PHYSICAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS TYPE ARE HIS QUICK ENERGY BASED ON HIS WONDERFUL BREATHING SYSTEM
HE GOES THROUGH LIFE OVER THE SHORTEST ROADS LIKES THE COMMON PEOPLE
BUT HIS HEAVINESS IS DUE TO MUSCLE INSTEAD OF FAT HE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF STANDING FIRMLY SOLIDLY UPON THE GROUND OF BEING STALWART AND STRONG THE SQUARE SHOULDERED MAN
BUT THEY ARE SO FORGIVING THEMSELVES
STRONG POINTS PERSONAL AMBITION ADAPTABILITY AND QUICK PHYSICAL ENERGY ARE THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THE THORACIC WEAKEST POINTS TOO GREAT EXCITABILITY IRRESPONSIBILITY AND SUPERSENSITIVENESS
IT BREAKS DOWN MORE EASILY AND MORE COMPLETELY
NEVER FOUND IN OTHER TYPES HIS PLEASING VOICE
TOO GREAT RESERVE AND TOO MUCH ABSTRACTNESS IN CONVERSATION ARE THE THINGS THAT HANDICAP THE CEREBRAL HIS SMALL STATURE AND TIMID AIR ALSO ADD TO HIS APPEARANCE OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND CAUSE HIM TO BE OVERLOOKED AT SOCIAL AFFAIRS EMOTIONAL ASSETS
IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER TYPES TAKING PART PLEASE OBSERVE THAT THEY ARE SECONDARY TO THE ACROBATS THEY CATCH THE HANDKERCHIEFS OR OTHERWISE ACT AS FOILS FOR THE REAL PERFORMERS ALL THE HARD WORK IN THE ACT WILL BE DONE BY MUSCULARS
AND LEADS THE MOST EXCITING EXISTENCE OF ANY TYPE BEING ABLE TO GET THRILLS OUT OF THE MOST COMMONPLACE EVENT BECAUSE OF SEEING ELEMENTS IN IT WHICH OTHERS OVERLOOK HE FINDS IN EVERYDAY LIFE MORE NOVELTY THAN OTHERS EVER SEE
AND DOES NOT BELONG IN ANY STRICTLY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE THORACIC IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE
WE SPECIFY THE REFERENCE ROOM OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THOSE WHO SEARCH FOR FICTION NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES ARE NOT NECESSARILY OF THE PURE TYPE
IS ONE OF THE MOST LOVABLE THORACIC TRAITS DOMESTIC WEAKNESS THE TEMPERAMENT AND TEMPER OF THIS TYPE
WE REPEAT HE IS NO MORE SQUARE MORALLY THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
WE MAY BE INDIFFERENT TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS DOING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
NOTE THE EXTREMELY MUSCULAR FACE AND JAW COMBAT OR PERSONAL FIGHTING IS A MATTER OF MUSCLE ACTION BEING WELL EQUIPPED FOR IT THIS TYPE ACTUALLY ENJOYS IT THAT IS WHY HE IS OFTENER IN TROUBLE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE PHRASE
WHEREAS THE ALIMENTIVE AVOIDS PEOPLE HE DOES NOT CARE FOR THE THORACIC IS INCLINED TO BETRAY HIS AVERSIONS HE OCCASIONALLY DELIGHTS TO PUT PEOPLE HE DISLIKES AT A DISADVANTAGE BY HIS WIT OR SATIRE THE STONY INDIVIDUAL WHO WALKS THROUGH LIFE
IS THE WAY THE TICKER WOULD READ IF IT COULD MAKE A RECORD OF THE INNER FEELINGS OF THE AVERAGE THORACIC THESE FEELINGS OFTEN COME AND GO
THEY OFTEN REFRAIN FROM ATTEMPTING A RECONCILIATION BUT THE THORACIC'S FORGIVENESS IS NOT ONLY SPONTANEOUS BUT GENUINE THE ALIMENTIVE BEARS NO GRUDGES BECAUSE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE
THE EXTREME CEREBRAL OFTEN HAS A DEFICIENT SENSE OF TIME HE IS LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE PASSAGE OF THE HOURS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE THE MUSCULAR AND THE OSSEOUS OFTEN HAVE AN ALMOST UNCANNY TIME SENSE BUT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL MAN OFTEN LACKS IT
THAT JUST THAT WEEK HE HAD SEEN A VERY TALL UNMUSCULAR MAN PERFORMING IN AN ACROBATIC ACT AT THE ORPHEUM
HE ALLOWS HIS ASSOCIATES TO SEE MUCH OF WHAT IS PASSING IN HIS MIND ALL THE TIME
LIKES DASH THE THORACIC WANTS EVERYTHING HE WEARS DRIVES LIVES IN OR OWNS TO GET ACROSS TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION THE FAT MAN LOVES COMFORT ABOVE ALL ELSE BUT THE FLORID MAN LOVES DISTINCTION
THE THORACIC FEELS EVERYTHING KEENLY LIFE'S EXPERIENCES MAKE VIVID RECORDS ON THE SENSITIVE PLATE OF HIS MIND
EACH PURE TYPE HAS ITS OWN AND NO OTHER IS EVER SEEN ON THE EXTREME OF THAT TYPE THE HAND OF THE MUSCULAR LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIS BODY IS BUILT IN A SERIES OF SQUARES IT RUNS OUT FROM THE WRIST AND DOWN IN A STRAIGHTER LINE
OTHER REASONS FOR THIS PREFERENCE ARE HIS BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONAL POWERS HIS CHARM AND HIS ENJOYMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE
THE FRAIL CURVING HAND WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE A SIGN OF ARTISTIC TALENT FROM THE STAGE OF OLD DOWN TO THE MOVIES OF TODAY THE TYPICAL ARTIST IS PICTURED WITH A SLIGHT SLENDER HAND THIS TAPERING FINGERED HAND DENOTES A KEEN SENSE OF ARTISTIC VALUES
BUT PRACTICAL AND VERY EFFICIENT IN THEIR PARENTHOOD
THEY MISS MANY OF THE GOOD THINGS LESS BRAINY AND MORE AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE GAIN BUT IT DOES NO GOOD TO EXPLAIN THIS TO A CEREBRAL HE ENJOYS RETIREMENT AND IS CONSTANTLY MISSING OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO MIX
THE MUSCULAR IS SERIOUS IN BUSINESS NOT A JOLLIER LIKE THE ALIMENTIVE NOR A THRILLER LIKE THE THORACIC AND HE WANTS YOU TO BE THE SAME REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE MUSCULAR IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE ARE
PLAYS ABOUT PLAIN PEOPLE THEIR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES HOPES AND FEARS ARE THE KIND THAT INTEREST THIS TYPE MOST THE PROBLEM PLAY OF A DECADE AGO WAS A PRIME FAVORITE WITH HIM
JUST AS A HIGH POWERED CAR IS MORE EASILY WRECKED THAN A TRUCK MUSIC HE LIKES HIGHBROW MUSIC IS KEPT ALIVE MOSTLY BY HIGHBROWS
AND THE PILLAR RETURNS THE COMPLIMENT WE DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WE SELDOM UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT DIFFERS DECIDEDLY FROM OURSELVES THUS WE DISTRUST AND DISLIKE FOREIGNERS AND TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT OTHER FAMILIES
HE IS NOT ADDICTED TO LATE HOURS WINE WOMEN OR EXCITEMENT DISEASES HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO NERVOUS DISEASES OF ALL KINDS MOST FREQUENTLY AFFLICT THIS TYPE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SUPERSENSITIVE
SYMPATHY GENTLENESS AND SELF SACRIFICE ARE OTHER ASSETS OF THIS TYPE EMOTIONAL LIABILITIES A TENDENCY TO NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND TO A LACK OF BALANCE ARE THE CHIEF EMOTIONAL HANDICAPS OF THIS TYPE
THIS HELPS HIM AS A LAWYER OR SPEAKER BUT IT HURTS HIM IN BUSINESS CURBING HIS COMBATIVENESS IN BUSINESS SHOULD BE ONE OF HIS CHIEF AIMS DOMESTIC STRENGTH
THIS TYPE LIKES HEAVY STABLE MATERIALS WHEREAS THE ALIMENTIVE WANTS COMFORTABLE CLOTHES AND THE THORACIC DISTINCTIVE ONES THE MUSCULAR WANTS WEARABLE EVERYDAY CLOTHES HE WANTS THE MATERIALS TO BE OF THE BEST
TO RESPOND QUICKLY WITH HIS PHYSICAL REACTIONS WHILE DEVOTING HIS MENTAL ONES TO SOMETHING ELSE HAS OBTAINED FOR THIS TYPE
IS NOW AGREED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS THE THING WE HAVE CALLED INTUITION THEY MAINTAIN IS NOT DUE TO IRREGULAR OR SUPERNATURAL CAUSES BUT TO OUR OWN NORMAL NATURAL MENTAL PROCESSES
THIS ACCOUNTS FOR HIS DEMOCRACY FOR HIS SUCCESS AS AN ORATOR AND SOMETIMES FOR HIS BEING BROKE NOT A QUICK FORGIVER BUT DISAPPOINT HIM IN ANYTHING HE CONSIDERS VITAL
HIS PUGNACITY IS ALSO A SEVERE DRAWBACK EMOTIONAL ASSETS UNDERSTANDING ENTHUSIASM AND WARMTH OF HEART
WITH ALL HIS OWN GIVING TO OTHERS HE SELDOM TAKES MUCH FROM OTHERS THE NATURALLY INDEPENDENT STANDING ON HIS OWN LEGS
BUT IF YOU WILL NOTICE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A MOVIE IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU THAT THE FAT PEOPLE AND THE LARGE HEADED PEOPLE DO NOT LAUGH AT THE SAME THINGS THE PIE THROWING AND CUTEY COQUETTE THAT CONVULSE THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDER
COLORFUL SURROUNDINGS ARE MORE NECESSARY TO THE THORACIC THAN TO OTHER TYPES THE EVER CHANGING FASHIONS IN HOUSE DECORATIONS ARE WELCOME INNOVATIONS TO HIM HE SOON GROWS TIRED OF A THING REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH HE LIKED IT TO BEGIN WITH
SO HE STEERS CLEAR OF THEM IT WAS SURELY A THORACIC WHO FIRST CALLED THESE PEOPLE STICKS BUT THE REASON FOR THEIR ACTING LIKE STICKS WILL BE APPARENT IN ANOTHER CHAPTER HIS PET AVERSIONS
THE RESULT IS THAT HE IS WHAT IS CALLED MORE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS PERSON THAN ARE OTHER TYPES THE FAT MAN OFTEN WEARS AN OLD PAIR OF SHOES LONG PAST THEIR USEFULNESS BUT THE FLORID MAN THINKS MORE OF THE IMPRESSION HE CREATES
CONCERNING THE SELDOM SILENT EXTREMELY FLORID INDIVIDUAL SO
GO TO A BOXING MATCH OR A PRIZE FIGHT AND YOU WILL BE SURROUNDED BY THEM WHEN LOOKING FOR THE OSSEOUS ATTEND A CONVENTION OF EXPERT ACCOUNTANTS BANKERS LUMBERMEN HARDWARE MERCHANTS OR PIONEERS ALL THESE TYPES APPEAR IN OTHER PLACES
AND FINDS MONOTONY ALMOST UNBEARABLE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS NEVER TWO MINUTES THE SAME FITLY DESCRIBES THIS TYPE HE PASSES RAPIDLY FROM ONE VIVID SENSATION TO ANOTHER AND EXPRESSES EACH ONE SO COMPLETELY
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS TYPE EVEN THOUGH HE MAY HAVE
HE DOES NOT FEEL THE NECESSITY FOR BECOMING A MILLIONAIRE TO OBTAIN COMFORTS LIKE THE ALIMENTIVE NOR FOR EXTRAVAGANCES LIKE THE THORACIC WHEN HE IS RICH PHILANTHROPY MARKS THE EXPENDITURES OF THIS TYPE WHENEVER HE IS RICH
NOT SECRETIVE THE THORACIC DOES NOT BY PREFERENCE COVER UP HE DOES NOT BY PREFERENCE SECRETE HE DOES NOT EXCEPT WHEN NECESSARY KEEP HIS PLANS AND WAYS DARK
REGALES HIS FRIENDS AND ABOUT WHICH HE IS MORE FRANK AND OUTSPOKEN THAN ANY OTHER TYPE HE MAKES MANY FRIENDS BY HIS OBVIOUS OPENNESS AND HIS CAPACITY FOR SEEING THE INTERESTING DETAILS WHICH OTHERS OVERLOOK CHARMING CONVERSATIONALIST
IN THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE HIS MUSCLES ARE FIRM AND LARGE SUCH MUSCLES CAN NOT BE DISGUISED BUT SEEM TO STAND OUT ALL OVER HIM HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD BE HELPLESS MASSES OF FAT AND BONE
TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO A VEGETABLE DIET WHEN HE IS IN MODERATE CIRCUMSTANCES
IS LARGELY OF THE MUSCULAR TYPE
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE SOCIALLY DON'T PUT ON AIRS NOR EXPECT HIM TO WHEN YOU ARE MEETING THIS TYPE SOCIALLY BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND GENUINE WITH HIM IF YOU WOULD WIN HIM HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE IN BUSINESS
HE ANTICIPATES THOSE OF THE FUTURE
MUST BE DOING SOMETHING I CAN'T BEAR TO BE DOING NOTHING YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY SUCH A PERSON ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF MUSCLE
PREDOMINATING IN A PERSON DETERMINES WHAT HE DOES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE THE NATURE OF HIS MAIN ACTIVITIES THE TYPE WHICH COMES SECOND IN DEVELOPMENT WILL DETERMINE THE WAY HE DOES THINGS THE METHODS HE WILL FOLLOW IN DOING WHAT HIS PREDOMINANT TYPE SIGNIFIES
I WILL TRY ANYTHING ONCE MANY COURSE DINNERS IF THE FOOD IS GOOD ARE ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH THEM THE TRIMMINGS AT DINNER OUT OF THE ORDINARY SURROUNDINGS IN WHICH TO DINE ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO THIS TYPE
DON'T REGRET THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT A ONE DECISION A YEAR MAN
THE PLUTOCRATS WHEN HE FURTHERS THE CAUSES OF THE PROLETARIAT
WITH EVERY GUN IN PLACE MOST OF THE TIME HE IS FREQUENTLY IN VIOLENT QUARRELS WITH HIS FRIENDS AND SINCE HE DOES NOT RECOVER FROM HIS ANGER QUICKLY LIKE THE THORACIC HE OFTEN LOSES THEM FOR LIFE THE MOST GENEROUS FRIEND WHEN THEY LIKE YOU
LACKS PUGNACITY PRIMITIVE THINGS OF EVERY KIND ARE DISTASTEFUL TO THE CEREBRAL THE INSTINCTS OF DIGESTION SEX HUNTING AND PUGNACITY ARE BUT LITTLE DEVELOPED IN HIM
FAIL TO SO MUCH AS TURN UP THE CORNERS OF THE OTHER MAN'S MOUTH AND THE SUBTLE THINGS THAT AMUSE THE CEREBRAL GO OVER THE HEADS OF THE PURE ALIMENTIVES CARES FOR NO SPORTS
AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHAT HE BUYS WILL SERVE THAT END DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FASHION AND FLARE
FOR HER FACE AND HANDS ARE ULTRA SQUARE SHE SAID BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING LIGHTLY I JUST NATURALLY PUT THAT MUCH FORCE INTO EVERYTHING HIS FORCEFUL WALK HEAVY POWERFUL FORCEFUL STRIDES DISTINGUISH THE WALK OF THIS TYPE
FAR BELOW OR FAR ABOVE THEM
HE IS APT TO SAY ATROCIOUS THINGS AND TO EXAGGERATE HIS GRIEVANCES EVERYTHING MUST YIELD TO HIS DANDER ONCE IT IS UP
THAT MORE DEATHS ARE CAUSED ANNUALLY IN AMERICA BY OVER EATING THAN BY ANY OTHER TWO CAUSES UNDER EATING IS A VERY NECESSARY PRECAUTION BUT THE CEREBRAL CARRIES IT TOO FAR THE CEREBRAL LACKING A LARGE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM
MAKES MOST SINGERS EVERY HAND ARTIST WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE SPATULATE FINGERED HANDS IN SHORT MUSCULAR HANDS THE HAND OF THE FAMOUS CRAFTSMAN PIANIST SCULPTOR AND PAINTER INSTEAD OF BEING MORE FRAIL AND DELICATE
HE CAN TALK ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT WHEN HE WILL
WE CAN NOT SMILE SOB SPEAK NOR SING WITHOUT USING THEM WE WOULD HAVE NO PIANISTS
PEOPLE FROM OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY ET CETERA THE EASTERNER AND WESTERNER HAVE A NATURAL DISTRUST OF EACH OTHER AND THE CIVIL WAR IS NOT THE ONLY REASON FOR THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF SOUTHERNERS AND NORTHERNERS SO IT IS WITH INDIVIDUALS
SHE TOLD US THAT SHE USED TO SEND HER CEREBRAL HUBBY ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE LOAF OF BREAD THAT WAS FOUND LACKING JUST AS THEY WERE READY TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER ONLY TO WAIT HOURS AND THEN HAVE HIM COME BACK WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM NO BREAD AND NO REALIZATION OF HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN GONE
HE CAN BE TRUSTED TO WORK HARDER THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
IN DOING THIS IT WILL AID YOU IF YOU WILL NOTE WHETHER FAT BONE OR MUSCLE PREDOMINATES IN HIS BODILY STRUCTURE SECOND DECIDE WHICH OF THE FIVE TYPICAL FACES HIS FACE MOST RESEMBLES THIRD
BECAUSE HE EXPERIENCES SO MANY MOODS ENTERTAINMENT HE PREFERS SOCIAL AFFAIRS OF AN EXCLUSIVE ORDER WHERE HE WEARS HIS BEST BIB AND TUCKER AND EVERYBODY ELSE DOES THE SAME
HAVING DECIDED WHICH TYPE PREDOMINATES AND WHICH IS SECOND IN HIM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS COMBINATION IS MADE CLEAR TO YOU BY THE FOLLOWING LAW LAW OF COMBINATION THE TYPE
BUT IN EVERY INSTANCE IT WAS COMBINED WITH A LARGE MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT THE SOLID SITTER WHEN A MUSCULAR SITS DOWN HE DOES IT AS HE DOES EVERYTHING WITH DEFINITENESS AND FORCE HE DOES NOT SPILL OVER
GO TO A RESTAURANT THAT IS FAMOUS FOR ITS RICH FOODS WHEN YOU WANT TO SEE SEVERAL EXTREME THORACICS DROP INTO ANY VAUDEVILLE SHOW AND TAKE YOUR CHOICE FROM THE ACTORS OR FROM THE AUDIENCE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PURE MUSCULARS
AND FOR THAT REASON DOES NOT FEEL AS GREAT AN URGE TO DECORATE AMPLIFY OR EVEN FURNISH THE PLACE IN WHICH HE DWELLS STEP INTO THE ROOM OF ANY LITTLE BODIED LARGE HEADED MAN AND YOU WILL BE STRUCK BY TWO FACTS
AS DOES THE ALIMENTIVE NOR DRAPE HIMSELF GRACEFULLY LIKE THE THORACIC BUT PLANKS HIMSELF AS THOUGH HE MEANT BUSINESS ACTIVITY HIS KEYNOTE BECAUSE HE IS ESPECIALLY BUILT FOR IT THE MUSCULAR IS MORE ACTIVE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE WITHOUT MUSCLES
THOSE WHO DIFFER TOO WIDELY IN TYPE NEVER UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TOO LITTLE OF THE CHIEF THING THAT BUILDS FRIENDSHIPS EMOTIONS IN COMMON THE FORGIVING MAN
SINCE ACCOMPLISHMENT IS MEASURED SO LARGELY THEREBY IS THE GREATEST PHYSICAL ASSET OF THIS TYPE
AND A PROPORTIONATELY LARGE HEAD FOR THE BODY ANY PERSON WHO HAS THESE IS LARGELY OF THE CEREBRAL TYPE NO MATTER WHAT OTHER TYPES MAY BE INCLUDED IN HIS MAKEUP TO UNDERSTAND COMBINATIONS
INERTNESS IRKS HIM SHUT UP A MUSCULAR AND YOU DESTROY HIM HIS BIG MUSCLE SYSTEM CRIES OUT FOR SOMETHING TO DO HE BECOMES RESTLESS NERVOUS AND ILL WHEN CONFINED OR COMPELLED TO BE IDLE
OR THICKLY PADDED WITH FAT IN WHICH CASE
THIS IS DUE AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE TO PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSES THE HIGH CHEST SENSITIVE VOCAL CORDS CAPACIOUS SOUNDING BOARDS IN THE NOSE AND ROOF OF THE MOUTH ALL TEND TO GIVE THE VOICE OF THE THORACIC MANY NUANCES AND ACCENTS
HE IS THEREFORE A MAN WHO LIKES HARMONY AVOIDS COMING TO BLOWS AND GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO KEEP THE PEACE SUCH A MAN DOES NOT GO HUNTING AND SELDOM OWNS A GUN HE DISLIKES TO KILL OR HARM ANY CREATURE
THIS BEING THE CASE HE SUFFERS LITTLE FROM MENTAL CONGESTION THOUGH HE SOMETIMES PAYS A HIGH PRICE FOR HIS SELF EXPRESSION EVERYBODY IS INTERESTING MOST OF US ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THE WORLD SUSPECTS
TAKING MORE FREQUENT VACATIONS RELAXING EACH DAY AND CURBING HIS PUGNACITY SHOULD BE THE SPECIAL AIMS OF THIS TYPE SHOULD AVOID
YOUR QUICKNESS IF CALLED INTO COUNSEL WILL ENABLE YOU TO SEE FROM WHAT INSTINCTS YOUR MISTAKES HABITUALLY ARISE AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE POINTED
IF HE HAS BUT TEN STEPS TO GO HE WILL START OFF AS IF BEGINNING AN AROUND THE WORLD MARATHON YOU HEAR HIM COMING ALL MUSCULARS NOTIFY PEOPLE BY THEIR WALK OF THEIR APPROACH THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS LOUD INCISIVE TREAD
LEAVE HIM ALONE HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE IN BUSINESS DON'T EMPLOY THIS MAN FOR HEAVY MANUAL LABOR OR WHERE THERE IS MORE ARM WORK THAN HEAD WORK GIVE HIM MENTAL POSITIONS OR NONE IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH HIM AS A TRADESMAN
HE IS SOON DEVOURING BOOKS FOR OLDER HEADS WHY WON'T HE RUN AND PLAY LIKE OTHER CHILDREN WAILS MOTHER AND THAT BOY OUGHT TO BE MADE TO JOIN THE BALL TEAM SCOLDS FATHER BUT THAT BOY CONTINUES TO KEEP HIS NOSE IN A BOOK
WHO IS A COMBINATION HAS PROPORTIONATELY LONG ARMS THE ARMS OF PURE MUSCULARS ARE LONGER IN PROPORTION TO THE BODY THAN THE ARMS OF OTHER TYPES THE ARMS OF THE ALIMENTIVE ARE SHORT FOR HIS BODY BUT THE EXTREME MUSCULAR'S ARMS
HE MAY HAVE OTHER TYPES IN COMBINATION BUT IF HIS FINGERS ARE REALLY SQUARE SAWED OFF AT THE ENDS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO GIVE THEM LARGE INSTEAD OF TAPERING ENDS THAT PERSON HAS MORE THAN AVERAGE MUSCULARITY
BUT IN A PURELY LITERAL SENSE THE MUSCULAR IS ACTUALLY BUILT ON THE SQUARE HIS WHOLE FIGURE IS A COMBINATION OF SQUARES THE ALIMENTIVE IS BUILT UPON THE CIRCLE THE THORACIC ON THE KITE SHAPE BUT THE PURE MUSCULAR ALWAYS TENDS TOWARD A SQUARENESS OF OUTLINE
DANCERS AVIATORS INVENTORS OR WORKERS OF ANY KIND WITHOUT THEM EVERYTHING WE PUT TOGETHER FROM HOOKS AND EYES TO SKYSCRAPERS IS PLANNED BY OUR BRAINS BUT DEPENDS FOR ITS MATERIALIZATION UPON THE MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
THE ONLY PERSON THEREFORE WHOM THE MUSCULAR IS INCLINED TO SNUB
MORE SEDATE AND SOMBER TYPES CALL THE THORACICS BUBBLERS OR SPOUTERS JUST FOR THIS REASON THE INCESSANT TALKER THAT PERSON'S TALK GETS ON MY NERVES IS A REMARK OFTEN MADE BY ONE OF THE STAID STIFF TYPES
TO EACH THE KIND OF TRAINING WHICH WILL WEED OUT HIS WORST AND BRING OUT HIS BEST SHORT AND STOCKY
IT MAKES ME FEEL THAT I HAVE CHANGED MY LOCATION AND TAKES THE PLACE OF A TRIP EXPLAINED ONE GIRL NOT LONG AGO WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE EXACT COLOR OF HANGINGS WALL PAPER INTERIOR DECORATIONS AND ACCESSORIES
WE WILL GIVE LESS OF BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE OF BOTH TO THE CREATOR TYPE VS TRAINING THE MOST THAT TRAINING CAN DO IS TO BRACE UP THE WEAK SPOTS IN US TO CULTIVATE THE STRONG ONES
THIS IS BECAUSE HIS PHYSICAL FRAILTY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DO HEAVY WORK WHILE HIS MENTALITY ENABLES HIM TO THINK OUT WAYS AND MEANS OF GETTING A LIVING WITHOUT IT THOUGH THE CLUMSY CRIMINAL MAY BELONG TO ANY TYPE
TAKE NOTICE AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS
BUT HE CARES LESS FOR COLOR THAN THE THORACIC QUALITY RATHER THAN STYLE AND PLAINNESS RATHER THAN PRETTINESS ARE HIS STANDARDS IN DRESS MAKING OVER FATHER'S PANTS FOR JOHNNIE IS A JOB MUSCULAR WOMEN HAVE EXCELLED IN AND FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BECOME FAMOUS
AND WHY IT LIVES THAT WAY WE WILL KNOW WHY ONE CHILD JUST NATURALLY TELLS FIBS WHILE HIS TWIN BROTHER UNDER IDENTICAL TRAINING JUST NATURALLY TELLS THE TRUTH
AN INVETERATE READER STEP INTO THE REFERENCE ROOMS OF YOUR CITY LIBRARY ON A SUMMER'S DAY AND YOU WILL STAND MORE CHANCE OF FINDING EXAMPLES OF THIS EXTREME TYPE THERE THAN IN ANY OTHER SPOT
SERVE TO PROVE HOW CLOSE IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND MUSCLES THE HEART ITSELF IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A LARGE TOUGH LEATHER LIKE MUSCLE POSSESSING THE BEST EQUIPMENT FOR EXPRESSING EMOTION
AND HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE AVERAGE GROUP OF MORE OR LESS DRAB PERSONALITIES LIVES IN THE HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS GLAD ONE MOMENT AND SAD THE NEXT
TO THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM NOT TOUCHED BY THE STOMACH FOR THE PURPOSE OF REACHING THESE SUBURBS THERE WAS INVOLVED THE CIRCULATORY OR THORACIC SYSTEM AND THIS GAVE RISE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE THORACIC TYPE
THE SOCIAL NONCONFORMIST
PHYSICAL LIABILITIES A TENDENCY TO OVERWORK IS THE CHIEF PHYSICAL PITFALL OF THIS TYPE THE DISEASE TO WHICH HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE IS RHEUMATISM BUT OWING TO HIS LOVE OF ACTIVITY HE EXERCISES MORE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE AND THUS FORESTALLS MANY DISEASES
FOR THE ACTIVITY'S SAKE WORK PALLS ON THE ALIMENTIVE AND MONOTONY ON THE THORACIC BUT LEISURE IS WHAT PALLS ON THE MUSCULAR HE MAY HAVE WORKED TEN YEARS WITHOUT A VACATION AND HE MAY IMAGINE HE WANTS A LONG ONE
HE DOES NOT DEMAND SUCH EASY TO WEAR GARMENTS AS THE FAT MAN ON THE CONTRARY HE WILL UNDERGO EXTREME DISCOMFORT IF IT GIVES HIM A DISTINCTIVE APPEARANCE HE WANTS HIS HOUSE TO BE ELEGANT THE GROUNDS DIFFERENT
IN ALL THAT TOUCHES HIM AND HIS PERSONALITY IT MUST HAVE VERVE AND GO AND DISTINCTIVENESS
THEIR SQUARE JAWS THE SURE SIGN OF GREAT MUSCULARITY ARE FAMOUS THE WORLD OVER AND ESPECIALLY SO IN THESE DAYS WHEN WAR IS ONCE MORE IN FASHION THE NEXT TIME YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT FACES OF PERSHING HAIG HINDENBERG OR EVEN THAT OF YOUR TRAFFIC POLICEMAN
APPEARED TALLER THAN HE REALLY WAS HIGH PLATFORMS ALWAYS GIVE THIS ILLUSION FURTHERMORE HIS PARTNER IN THE ACT WAS OF DIMINUTIVE HEIGHT AND THE ACROBAT LOOKED TALL AND SLENDER BY CONTRAST WHY THEY DON'T DO IT
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON THAT YOU WILL LOSE LITTLE TIME
STRAIGHTFORWARD STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER MIGHT BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE METHOD OF THE PURE MUSCULAR IN WHAT HE DOES AND SAYS
MUCH OF THIS VEHEMENCE IN RADICALISM IS DUE TO THE FACT
AND DOES NOT CARE FOR MANY HE IS TOO ABSTRACT TO ADD TO THE GAIETY OF SOCIAL GATHERINGS FOR THESE ARE BASED ON THE ENJOYMENT OF THE CONCRETE ENJOYS THE INTELLECTUALS READERS THINKERS WRITERS
SPATULATE FINGERS MEANING FINGERS THAT ARE SQUARE OR PADDLE SHAPED AT THE TIPS
THIS ENTHUSIASM LITERALLY BURNS HIS WAY TO THE THINGS HE WANTS THE PLAIN TALKER WHEN DEEPLY MOVED THIS TYPE TALKS WELL IF THE MENTAL ELEMENT IS ALSO STRONG HE CAN BECOME A GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR HE WILL
BELONGS ALMOST ALWAYS TO A MUSCULAR
HE IS LIKELY TO TELL NOT ONLY HIS FAMILY BUT HIS NEWEST ACQUAINTANCES JUST WHAT HE IS PLANNING TO DO AND HOW HE EXPECTS TO DO IT THE NATURALLY SECRETIVE PERSON
AND THEREBY GAINS THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE WHO MEET HIM SOCIAL LIABILITIES
YOU WILL NEVER HEW OUT ANYTHING WORTH WHILE NO VAIN REGRETS
THE CEREBRAL IS THE MOST IMPERSONAL OF ALL TYPES WHILE THE ALIMENTIVE TENDS TO MEASURE EVERYTHING FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT IT CAN DO FOR HIM PERSONALLY THE CEREBRAL TENDS TO THINK MORE IMPERSONALLY AND TO BE INTERESTED IN MANY THINGS OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN AFFAIRS
HE HAS A BETTER NATURAL START IN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE SOCIAL LIABILITIES QUICK TEMPER HIS INFLAMMABLE NATURE AND APPEARANCES OF VANITY ARE HIS GREATEST SOCIAL LIABILITIES
HE LIKES THE COMMONPLACE THINGS AND IS NEVER A FOLLOWER AFTER THE THING THOUGH HE HAS NO PREJUDICES AGAINST IT AS THE FOURTH TYPE HAS AN EVERYDAY INDIVIDUAL THE MUSCULAR DOES NOT CARE FOR SHOW AND EXCEPT
BUT STAYS THERE LONGER ONCE THE DENT IS MADE NOT SO MALLEABLE
THAT HE USUALLY HAS A GOOD POSITION HE MAY NOT LIKE THE POSITION BUT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE FINDS IT HARDER TO TOLERATE DISAGREEABLE THINGS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
LIKES RESPONSIVE PEOPLE WE ALL LIKE ANSWERS WE WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT WHAT WE HAVE SAID OR DONE HAS REGISTERED THE THORACIC IS ALWAYS SAYING OR DOING SOMETHING AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SO UNRESPONSIVE
ALL THE OTHER TYPES HAVE DECIDED PREFERENCES AS TO THEIR CLOTHES THE ALIMENTIVE DEMANDS COMFORT THE THORACIC STYLE THE MUSCULAR DURABILITY AND THE OSSEOUS SAMENESS BUT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL TYPE SAYS ANYTHING WILL DO
BUT THE MUSCULAR OFTEN DOES IT FOR PEOPLE HE SCARCELY KNOWS IF THEY STRIKE HIS FANCY OR APPEAL TO HIM
BECAUSE WE ARE PRONE TO ADVISE OTHERS TO DO WHAT WE ENJOY DOING OURSELVES IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SO STRENUOUS A MAN AS T R SHOULD ADVOCATE WHOLESALE UNIVERSAL AND ALMOST COMPULSORY STRENUOSITY
RATHER THAN IN WINTER SO THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SELECT YOUR SUBJECTS FROM AMONGST PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE IN SPITE OF THE WEATHER RATHER THAN BECAUSE OF IT INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING I NEVER SAW A BOOK WITHOUT WANTING TO READ IT
HIS FASTIDIOUS HABITS THE THORACIC IS THE MOST FASTIDIOUS OF ALL THE TYPES HIS THIN SKIN AND SENSITIVE NERVES
OR THE EXECUTION WILL FALL SHORT OF THE IDEAL PICTURED IN THE ARTIST'S MIND THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE SELDOM MAKES AN ARTIST FOR AFTER ALL INSPIRED BRAIN WORK IS THE OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE CREATION OF ART AND THIS IS THE FORTE OF THE FIFTH TYPE
WHILE THE OTHER TYPES CULTIVATE A TASTE FOR GRAND OPERA OR SIMULATE IT BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSEDLY PROPER THE CEREBRAL REALLY ENJOYS IT IN THE TOP GALLERY AT ANY GOOD CONCERT YOU WILL FIND MANY CEREBRALS
FAMOUS MALE SINGERS CARUSO JOHN MC CORMACK AND ALL OTHER FAMOUS MALE SINGERS
HE YIELDS ONLY TO THOSE WHICH MAKE SUCH A STRONG APPEAL TO HIS TYPE THAT HE LACKS THE POWER OF RESISTANCE
THE THIRD ELEMENT IF NOTICEABLE MERELY FLAVORS HIS PERSONALITY THUS A CEREBRAL MUSCULAR ALIMENTIVE DOES MENTAL THINGS PREDOMINANTLY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE BUT IN A MORE MUSCULAR WAY THAN IF HE WERE AN EXTREME CEREBRAL
WHEN HE IS IN MODERATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN ONLY WELL TO DO THIS TYPE WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE CARRIED OUT FURNISHINGS AND DECORATIONS WITH THE TASTE WORTHY OF MUCH LARGER PURSES WHEN MERELY WELL TO DO HE WEARS THE VERY BEST CLOTHES HE CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD
THAN TO OTHERS EACH TYPE HAS ITS OWN WEAKNESSES AND POINTS OF STRENGTH AS DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER TYPES AND THESE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE MORAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE NO TYPE SUPERIOR MORALLY
PEOPLE WHO LET OTHERS DO THEIR THINKING FOR THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE GREAT THINGS GOING ON IN WORLD MOVEMENTS ARE NOT POPULAR WITH THIS TYPE HE SOMETIMES HAS A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR THEM
BUT QUICK TO REWARD MERIT THE MUSCULAR DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEMAND MONEY NOR THE THINGS THAT MONEY BUYS BUT HE TRIES TO GET THE WORKABLE OUT OF LIFE THE PROPERTY OWNER THIS TYPE LIKES TO HAVE A FAIR BANK ACCOUNT AND TO GIVE HIS CHILDREN
THEY DO THINGS OF GREAT MOMENT SOMETIMES INVENT SOMETHING OR WRITE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY BUT EVEN THEN THEY TRY TO AVOID BEING LIONIZED THEY PREFER THE SHADOWS RATHER THAN THE SPOTLIGHT THUS
BEHIND EVERY ROW OF FOOT LIGHTS YOU WILL FIND MORE PEOPLE OF THIS TYPE THAN ANY OTHER THE ALIMENTIVE MANAGES THE WORLD BUT THE THORACIC ENTERTAINS IT HE COMPRISES MORE OF THE DANCERS ACTORS OPERATIC STARS AND GENERAL ENTERTAINERS
I GOT A REAL KICK OUT OF THAT THIS CRAVING FOR ADVENTURE SUSPENSE AND ZEST
HE IS AS RESPONSIVE AS A RADIO WIRE EVERYTHING HITS THE MARK WITH HIM AND HE LETS YOU KNOW IT SO NATURALLY HE ENJOYS THE SAME FROM OTHERS AND CONSIDERS THOSE LESS EXPRESSIVE THAN HIMSELF STIFF FORMAL OR DULL
THE LACK OF SUCH A HAND EXPLAINS WHY THE ESTHETIC THE ARTISTIC MINDED AND THE CONNOISSEUR DO NOT CREATE THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THEY APPRECIATE HEAD AND HAND PARTNERS THE HAND MUST EXECUTE WHAT THE BRAIN PLANS
IT MUST BE A FIFTY PER CENT PARTNER ELSE ITS OWNER WILL NEVER PRODUCE REAL ART
ARE THINGS HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL AND WITH WHICH HE HAS LITTLE PATIENCE SUCH PEOPLE SEEM TO HIM TO BE COLD
IN ITS USE BEFORE JURIES CONGREGATIONS OR LARGE AUDIENCES IT MIGHT BE NOTED HERE THAT EVERY GREAT ORATOR HAS BEEN LARGELY OF THIS TYPE AND ALSO THAT HIS FAME CAME NOT ALONE FROM THE THINGS HE SAID BUT FROM THE STENTORIAN TONES IN WHICH HE SAID THEM
BOOKS AND STORIES THAT ARE ROMANTIC ADVENTUROUS AND DIFFERENT ARE THE FAVORITES OF THIS TYPE DETECTIVE STORIES ARE OFTEN IN HIGH FAVOR WITH HIM ALSO PHYSICAL ASSETS
BECAUSE HE FEELS THEY SERVE NO PRACTICAL PURPOSE AND GET HIM NOWHERE THIS TYPE DOES NOT ATTEND THE THEATER MERELY TO BE AMUSED HE GOES FOR LIGHT ON HIS EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES AND USUALLY CONSIDERS TIME WASTED THAT IS SPENT SOLELY ON ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC HE LIKES
THE HANGINGS PICTURES AND FURNITURE MEAN MUCH TO HIM MOST PEOPLE LIKE MUSIC AT MEALS BUT TO THE THORACIC IT IS ALMOST INDISPENSABLE HE IS SO ALIVE IN EVERY NERVE
ARE THE OUTSTANDING EMOTIONAL ASSETS OF THIS TYPE EMOTIONAL LIABILITIES IMPATIENCE MERCURIAL EMOTIONS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF TOO MUCH OF HIS ELECTRICITY IN EVERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE ARE THE TENDENCIES MOST TO BE GUARDED AGAINST
THE CLEVEREST CROOKS THOSE WHO DEFY DETECTION FOR YEARS ALWAYS HAVE A LARGE ELEMENT OF THE CEREBRAL IN THEIR MAKEUP BIG BRAINS IN LITTLE JOBS
THE ALIMENTIVE LIKES LOTS OF RICH FOOD
IN THE GRIP OF THESE TEMPTATIONS HE MAY COMMIT ANYTHING FROM DISCOURTESY TO CRIME ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE TEMPTATION PLUS HIS OWN LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION ON THE OTHER HAND CERTAIN IMMORALITIES WHICH APPEAL STRONGLY TO SOME TYPES HAVE NO ATTRACTION WHATEVER FOR OTHERS
AND THOSE SITUATIONS THAT CARRY HIM FARTHER AWAY FROM THE REAL WORLD HIS STRONG POINTS HIS THINKING CAPACITY PROGRESSIVENESS UNSELFISHNESS AND HIGHLY CIVILIZED INSTINCTS ARE THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THIS TYPE HIS WEAKEST POINTS
AND NOT BECAUSE HE ENJOYS PREENING HIMSELF
AND ARE MUCH BROADER IN PROPORTION TO HIS HEIGHT THE ALIMENTIVE HAS SLOPING SHOULDERS AND THE THORACIC INCLINES TO HIGH SHOULDERS
HE INSISTS ON THINGS BEING DONE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY
AND HIS LACK OF RETICENCE IN GIVING THE INTIMATE AND INTERESTING DETAILS ARE OTHER TRAITS WHICH HELP TO MAKE THE THORACIC A LIVELY COMPANION THE LURE OF SPONTANEITY THE MOST BELOVED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE THE SPONTANEOUS
WHEN IN TROUBLE THIS TYPE IS NOT GIVEN TO SLIDING OUT OF DIFFICULTIES LIKE THE ALIMENTIVE NOR TO BEING TEMPORARILY SUBMERGED BY THEM LIKE THE THORACIC HE STANDS UP TO THEM AND BACKS THEM DOWN WHEN IN TROUBLE HE ACTS
WE ARE TOO MUCH INCLINED TO THINK OF THE PRODUCTS OF THESE ARTS AS BEING CREATED OUT OF SHEER ARTISTIC SENSE ARTISTIC TASTE OR ARTISTIC INSIGHT BUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION WILL SHOW THAT EVERY TANGIBLE ARTISTIC CREATION
THE ALIMENTIVE SPECIALIZES IN DESSERTS THE THORACIC IN UNUSUAL DISHES BUT THE MUSCULAR WANTS SOLID FARE
AND THOUGH IT MAKES A DENT THAT DENT PUFFS BACK QUICKLY
HE IS IN DANGER OF APOPLEXY THE COMBINATION OF EXTREME THORACIC AND EXTREME ALIMENTIVE TENDENCIES IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE LIKES FANCY FOODS VARIETY AND NOVELTY IN FOOD
A STURDY NECK IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INDICATIONS OF PHYSICAL PROWESS AND LONGEVITY WHILE THE FRAIL NECK OF WHICH WE SHALL SPEAK IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH TYPE IS ALWAYS A SIGN OF THE PHYSICAL FRAILTY WHICH ENDANGERS LIFE
UNCOMMON WORKS OF ART ARE USUALLY FOUND IN THE HOMES OF THIS TYPE THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS FROM THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PLACES ARE ESPECIAL PREFERENCES WITH HIM HE CARRIES OUT HIS DESIRE FOR ATTENTION HERE
OR WELL UPHOLSTERED WITH FIRM MEAT IN THE LATTER CASE HE IS LARGELY MUSCULAR NO MATTER WHAT OTHER TYPES MAY BE PRESENT IN HIS MAKEUP
THESE HAVE MADE HIM THE BORN ORATOR THE RADICAL
IS SURROUNDED BY TEMPTATIONS OF SOME KIND MOST OF THE TIME HE DOES NOT WANT TO YIELD TO ANY OF THEM
HISTORY SHOWS THAT FEW PEOPLE OF THE PURE CEREBRAL TYPE EVER BECAME RICH EVEN THE MOST BRILLIANT GAVE SO MUCH MORE THOUGHT TO THEIR MISSION THAN THE PRACTICAL WAYS AND MEANS THAT THEY WERE USUALLY SERIOUSLY HANDICAPPED FOR THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO ITS MATERIALIZATION
IN THAT INDIVIDUAL'S MAKEUP HIS POWERFUL MOVEMENTS FORCEFUL DECISIVE MOVEMENTS ALSO CHARACTERIZE THIS TYPE HE IS INCLINED TO GO AT EVEN THE MOST TRIVIAL THINGS WITH AS MUCH FORCE AS IF THE WORLD DEPENDED ON IT
DOMESTIC WEAKNESS CRUEL ANGRY WORDS DO THE MUSCULAR MUCH HARM IN HIS FAMILY LIFE THEY CAUSE HIS NEAREST AND DEAREST TO HOLD AGAINST HIM THE RESENTMENTS THAT FOLLOW SHOULD AIM AT
AND SINCE EACH TYPE POSSESSES ABOUT AS MANY WEAKNESSES AS THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS THAT NO TYPE IS SUPERIOR MORALLY TO ANY OTHER AND NO TYPE IS MORALLY INFERIOR TO ANY OTHER TYPE AND TEMPTATION MORALITY IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF HOW MUCH TEMPTATION YOU CAN WITHSTAND
THE HAND OF THE CREATIVE ARTIST THE ARTIST'S HAND AND THE ARTISTIC HAND ARE PHRASES LONG USED BUT MISUSED DELICATE TAPERING FINGERS WERE SUPPOSED IN ANCIENT TIMES TO DENOTE ARTISTIC ABILITY
OR MUSICAL COMPOSITION WHICH COULD MORE PROPERLY BE CALLED ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES
BUT SUPPOSE YOU JUST ASK BOBBY MC GINNIS TO COME HERE TO ME AND ASK HIS QUESTION DIRECT I WILL SEE HIM NOW AND PATTY WONDERING VAGUELY WHAT HAD COME TO HER GENTLE EYED GENTLE VOICED MISTRESS AS SHE INSISTED UPON CALLING MARGARET FLED
WHAT OF IT RETORTED BOBBY
THEY AREN'T EVEN TWELVE SOME OF THEM THEY'RE BABIES OF NINE AND TEN SHE PAUSED EXPECTANTLY BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE ONLY TURNED HIS HEAD SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIS EYES
MARGARET HAD BEEN AT HOME FOUR WEEKS WHEN THE INVITATION FOR PATTY ARABELLA CLARABELLA AND THREE OF THE WHALENS TO VISIT HER FINALLY LEFT HER MOTHER'S HANDS THERE HAD NOT BEEN A DAY OF ALL THOSE FOUR WEEKS THAT MARGARET HAD NOT TALKED OF THE COMING VISIT
WERE FEELING THE BENEFICIAL RESULTS OF THE LESSONS TO MARGARET HOWEVER THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HOPELESSLY SMALL THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO SO LITTLE DONE SHE WAS STILL THE LITTLE GIRL WITH THE TEASPOON AND THE BOWL OF SAND AND THE CHASM YAWNED
MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE WALKED THE STREET OUTSIDE WATCHING THE LIGHT AT YOUR WINDOW AND MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE NOT GONE HOME UNTIL DAWN
OR OF THE FOLDED SQUARE OF CLOTH BROUGHT DISASTER TO HERSELF AND TEARS TO HER MOTHER'S EYES SHE EARNESTLY DESIRED TO AS SHE EXPRESSED IT TO BOBBY COME UP TO THE SCRATCH AND WALK STRAIGHT AND IT WAS TO BOBBY THAT SHE LOOKED FOR AID AND COUNSEL
SHE EVEN CARRIED HER DISTRESS OVER THEIR CONDITION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HER MOTHER REALLY FEARED FOR HER REASON ALL HER TEACHERS THEREFORE WERE INSTRUCTED TO KEEP FROM HER ALL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF POVERTY AND TROUBLE
SHE STOOD BACK WITH A FLOURISH AND PREPARED FOR THE INTRODUCTIONS UNCONSCIOUSLY HER WORDS AND MANNER APED THOSE OF HER MOTHER IN SUNDRY OTHER INTRODUCTIONS THAT HAD FIGURED IN HER OWN EXPERIENCE DURING THE LAST FOUR WEEKS
NOT ONCE BUT MANY TIMES DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS DID MARGARET TALK WITH HER MOTHER ON THIS SUBJECT THAT SO TROUBLED HER THE RESULT OF THESE CONFERENCES BOBBY LEARNED NOT FIVE DAYS LATER
BUT MEBBE YOU'VE ALREADY ER PICKED HIM OUT EH MARGARET DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR SHE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT THROUGH A LITTLE OPEN SPACE IN THE BOUGHS OF THE APPLE TREE TO THE BLUE SKY FAR BEYOND BOBBY SHE BEGAN IN A VOICE SCARCELY ABOVE A WHISPER
I WILL SEE AND SHE DID SEE
EVEN NOW THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT COME TO MY HOME SHE WAS GOING ABROAD WITH FRIENDS THE PARTY INCLUDED AN IRREPROACHABLE CHAPERON SO OF COURSE I HAD NOTHING TO SAY WHILE AS FOR MONEY
FOR SOME TIME AFTER MC GINNIS WENT AWAY MARGARET REMAINED AT THE MILL HOUSE BUT SHE WAS RESTLESS AND UNHAPPY IN THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF MC GINNIS TAUGHT AN EVENING CLASS AT THE MILL HOUSE AND SHE KNEW
AND THEN HURRY BACK TO AMERICA ALONE AS FOR FRANK HIMSELF HE HAD NOT WRITTEN HER SINCE HIS ILLNESS MARGARET WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS AND WAS FEELING SPECIALLY FORLORN
AS YOU INSIST UPON CALLING IT BUT IF YOU WON'T WHY I MUST THAT IS ALL I MUST BE THERE TO SUPERINTEND MATTERS THEN I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO MOANED MISSUS MERIDETH
LEAVING MARGARET TO MY CARE BOY THOUGH I WAS I WAS ONLY TWENTY YOU SEE BUT REALLY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO WHOM HE COULD LEAVE HER THAT WAS SOMETHING OVER THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MARGARET MUST BE ABOUT TWENTY THREE NOW
AND ALWAYS MARGARET WAS SEEKING FOR A POSSIBLE AVERTING OF THE CATASTROPHE TO CONVINCE HER MOTHER OF THE AWFULNESS OF THE FATE AWAITING HER AND SO TO PERSUADE HER TO ABANDON THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION MARGARET SOON FOUND
AS FOR THE BIG WHITE SQUARE OF FOLDED CLOTH THAT HER MOTHER THOUGHT SO NECESSARY AT EVERY MEAL ITS DAINTY PURITY FILLED MARGARET WITH DISMAY LEST SHE SOIL OR WRINKLE IT AND FOR HER PART SHE WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO LET IT QUITE ALONE
WE SHALL HAVE TEACHERS TO HELP US YOU KNOW PATTY AND I ARE GOING TO NEW YORK TO SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND HER SISTERS ARABELLA AND CLARABELLA WHAT ABSURD NAMES MISSUS MERIDETH SPOKE SHARPLY IN REALITY
HIS UTTER WANT OF SYMPATHY WITH EVERYTHING SHE HAD BEEN DOING THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND INVOLUNTARILY SHE SHUDDERED SPENCER SAW THE SENSITIVE QUIVER AND DREW BACK TOUCHED TO THE QUICK MARGARET STRUGGLED TO HER FEET
SHE LEARNED THAT WHILE THERE WERE MEN
AND PICKED UP A BIT OF PAPER FROM THE FLOOR OF COURSE IT IS USELESS SHE RETORTED IN WHAT SHE HOPED WAS A MERRY VOICE AND HE DOESN'T EVEN LOVE ME NOW BESIDES HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU FRANK SPENCER'S EYES AND VOICE WERE AMAZED
YES I SEE SAID BOBBY SO CROSSLY THAT MARGARET OPENED HER EYES IN WONDER WHY BOBBY YOU DON'T CARE CAUSE THEY'RE GOIN AWAY DO YOU DON'T I HE GROWLED HUMPH
ON THE LOST AND FOUND NOR WAS THIS ALL TO MISSUS KENDALL IT SEEMED THAT ALMOST EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE PLACE CAME TO HER DOOR WITH INQUIRIES AND CONGRATULATIONS TOGETHER
A LETTER FROM MARGARET HAD GONE TO PATTY AND ONE FROM MISSUS KENDALL TO MISS MURDOCK THE CITY MISSIONARY WHO HAD BEEN SO GOOD TO MARGARET HOUGHTONSVILLE WAS ON A MAIN LINE TO NEW YORK AND BUT A FEW HOURS RIDE FROM THE CITY
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN
OH BUT IF I'M HERE I SHALL BE THERE CONTESTED MARGARET WITH A HASTE THAT REFUSED TO CONSIDER LOGIC THEN AS SHE SAW THE WHIMSICAL SMILE COME INTO THE MAN'S EYES SHE ADDED BROKENLY
CLEARLY AS SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS ONLY A DREAM YET THE VISION HAUNTED HER AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME APPREHENSION THAT SHE WENT WITH MARGARET TO THE STATION TO MEET HER GUESTS ON THE DAY APPOINTED
TO DO MY OBVIOUS DUTY AT ONCE THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS DOING THINGS FOR PEOPLE HE SAID FONDLY THEN HE GREW SUDDENLY GRAVE THE DEAR CHILD I'M AFRAID THAT ALONG WITH HER EDUCATION
BUT I NEVER DID FORGET QUITE EVEN WHEN YEARS AND YEARS HAD PASSED AND I COULD GO EVERYWHERE AND SEE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND PLACES I HAD READ ABOUT AND WHEN I WAS WITH MY FRIENDS
YES SHE IS KIND O PEAKED VOLUNTEERED PATTY MISS MURDOCK SAYS AS HOW HER FOOD DON'T SIMILATE
NOW WITH MY PEOPLE DOWN THERE AT THE MILLS AND HER VOICE RANG WITH SELF SCORN THE MAN FROWNED HE TOO GOT TO HIS FEET AND WALKED NERVOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHEN HE CAME BACK THE GIRL HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN
DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE COUNTLESS GLEAMING WINDOWS AND THE TALL BLACK CHIMNEYS SHOWED WHERE THE MILL WORKERS STILL TOILED THOSE MILL WORKERS WHOM THE MAN HAD COME ALMOST TO HATE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEM THAT MARGARET WAS GOING
HE LIFTED HIS CHIN QUIZZICALLY AND GAZED DOWN FROM THE LOFTY SUPERIORITY OF HIS FOURTEEN YEARS
AND HE TURNED AWAY A WEEK LATER MARGARET LEARNED THAT ROSY AND KATY WERE OUT OF SCHOOL WHEN SHE LOOKED THEM UP SHE FOUND THEM AT WORK IN THE MILLS THIS MATTER OF THE SCHOOL QUESTION WAS A GREAT PUZZLE TO MARGARET VERY EARLY IN HER EFFORTS
I TAKE DIVIDENDS FROM THE VERY MILLS THAT MAKE THE CHILDREN SUFFER A LONG TIME AGO I WANTED TO DIVVY UP WITH PATTY AND BOBBY AND THE REST I HAVE EVEN THOUGHT LATELY
AND TOM SETTLED THE QUESTION AT ONCE BY UNCEREMONIOUSLY THROWING PETER ON TO ONE OF THEM
CRYING ALL ALONE IN THE OLD SUMMERHOUSE DOWN IN THE GARDEN GORRY WHAT'S UP HE QUESTIONED ADDING CHEERILY SOLDIERS DAUGHTERS DON'T CRY IT WAS A QUOTATION FROM MARGARET'S OWN CHILDHOOD'S CREED
WITH AN EXALTATION THAT RENDERED HER OBLIVIOUS TO TASTE AND FEELING IN DUE TIME THE MILL HOUSE AS MARGARET CALLED HER NEW HOME WAS READY FOR OCCUPANCY AND THE FAMILY MOVED IN NAMING THE PLACE HAD GIVEN MARGARET NO LITTLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT
TO BECOME AT ONCE MARGARET KENDALL THE DAINTY LITTLE DAUGHTER OF A WELL BRED FASTIDIOUS MOTHER TO THE DOCTOR
TO A SWARM OF NOISY CHILDREN WHO DEMANDED THEM FOR CHARADES TOM PETER MARY PATTY ARABELLA AND CLARABELLA HAD BEEN AT FIVE OAKS TWO WEEKS WHEN ONE DAY BOBBY MC GINNIS FOUND MARGARET
HE BEGAN BUT MARGARET INTERRUPTED HIM I KNEW IT I JUST KNEW IT I JUST KNEW THERE WASN'T ANY SHE MOANED BUT I CAN'T MAKE MOTHER SEE IT I JUST CAN'T THIS WAS BUT THE FIRST OF MANY TALKS BETWEEN MARGARET AND BOBBY UPON THE SAME SUBJECT
THE MAN'S GAZE DRIFTED FROM HER FACE TO THE ARM THE SLENDER WRIST AND THE TAPERING FINGERS SO CLEARLY OUTLINED IN ALL THEIR FAIRNESS AGAINST THE DARK MAHOGANY AND SO PLAINLY ALL UNFITTED FOR STRIFE OR STRUGGLE WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
WHO ARE GENEROUS AND KIND TO THE POOR BUT THEY ARE ON ONE SIDE OF THE LINE AND THE POOR ARE ON THE OTHER THEY MERELY PASS THINGS OVER THE LINE THEY NEVER GO THEMSELVES AND THAT IS ALL RIGHT
MARGARET SAW AND UNDERSTOOD AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HER HOSPITABLE LITTLE SOUL SHE STROVE TO PUT HER GUESTS AT THEIR EASE WITH A GLAD LITTLE CRY SHE GAVE ONE AFTER ANOTHER A BEAR LIKE HUG THEN
BUT COULD SET NO DATE FOR THEIR RETURN FRANK IN PARTICULAR WAS DISTURBED THEY SAID HE HAD NOT PLANNED TO LEAVE EITHER HERSELF OR THE MILLS SO LONG IT BEING HIS INTENTION WHEN HE WENT AWAY MERELY TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP WITH HIS SISTER AND BROTHER
SO VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE SHE SIGHED THE MILL HOUSE IS GOOD AND DOES GOOD I ACKNOWLEDGE BUT IT'S SO PUNY AFTER ALL IT'S LIKE A TINY LITTLE OASIS IN A HUGE DESERT OF POVERTY AND DISTRESS
SOUGHT HER OUT ONE DAY AND SAID LOW IN HER EAR IF IT WERE JUNE AND NOT DECEMBER AND IF WE WERE OUT IN THE AUTO INSTEAD OF HERE BY THE FIRE I'M WONDERING WOULD I NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR THOSE BRAKES THE GIRL WINCED
THOUGH MARGARET WOULD NOT OWN IT TO HERSELF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE YOUNG MAN ROBERT MC GINNIS HAD SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED HER NOT A LITTLE MARGARET KENDALL WAS NOT USED TO HAVING HER PRESENCE AND HER GRACIOUS INVITATIONS IGNORED
BOBBY WAS SILENT HIS HANDS WERE IN HIS POCKET AND HIS EYES WERE ON AN ANT STRUGGLING WITH A BURDEN ALMOST AS LARGE AS ITSELF DON'T YOU SEE BOBBY IT'S WICKED THAT I AM AWFUL WICKED
MARGARET LOOK AT ME LET ME SEE YOUR EYES THERE WAS A NOTE OF TRIUMPHANT JOY IN HIS VOICE NOW STILL NO ANSWER MARGARET IT DID NOT GO THAT LOVE IT STAYED WITH ME DAY AFTER DAY
JUST TEACH THOSE DREADFUL CREATURES AND AND LIVE THERE CERTAINLY NOT DECLARED MARGARET WITH A BRIGHT SMILE I'VE PLANNED A TRIP TO NEW YORK TO NEW YORK MISSUS MERIDETH SAT UP SUDDENLY HER FACE ALIGHT OH THAT WILL BE FINE LOVELY
HAS BEEN ASKING YOUR HELP FOR SOME OF HIS PET SCHEMES ON THE CONTRARY MISTER MC GINNIS HAS NOT SPOKEN TO ME OF THE MILL WORKERS CORRECTED MARGARET QUIETLY
BUT YOU DO KNOW FOLKS JUST LIKE EM AND MOTHER DON'T YOU SEE SHE KNOWS ONLY THE KIND THAT LIVES HERE AND SHE SHE DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT YOU KNOW BOTH KINDS
YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE MORE FOR THEIR COMFORT AND HAPPINESS THAN ANY HUMAN BEING COULD EXPECT OF YOU I KNOW BUT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT IS IN A PECULIAR WAY THAT THEY ARE MY PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE
AS WERE THE WIDE LAWNS AND BRILLIANT FLOWER BEDS INSIDE THE HOUSE THE CHILDREN BLINKED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE LACE HUNG WINDOWS AND GOLD FRAMED PICTURES AND CLARABELLA BALANCING HERSELF ON HER TOES
SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT THE FEELING SHE HAD FOR BOBBY WAS NOT LOVE AND SHE ASKED HERSELF SCORNFULLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO COULD GIVE THAT LOVE ALL UNSOUGHT TO A MAN
EVEN ALREADY A VISIBLE INFLUENCE HAD RADIATED FROM ITS SHINING WINDOWS AND ORDERLY YARD AND THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES WITH THEIR OBVIOUS ATTEMPT AT SLICKIN UP
HER ELBOWS WERE ON THE TABLE AND HER LINKED FINGERS WERE SHIELDING HER EYES INVOLUNTARILY THE MAN REACHED HIS HAND
I MUST MAKE ONE EFFORT TO KEEP YOU IF YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOME ONE HERE WHO LOVED YOU WHO LOVED YOU WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS BEING
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE CORRECTED SOME OF COURSE IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE BUT SHE'LL COME OUT STRAIGHT HER HEART IS ALL RIGHT MISSUS KENDALL LAUGHED SOFTLY HER HEART DOCTOR SHE EXCLAIMED JUST THERE LIES THE GREATEST PROBLEM OF ALL
MEANT EVERYTHING THAT WAS LONELINESS AND GRIEF WOULD YOU COULD YOU STAY MARGARET STARTED SHE WOULD NOT LOOK INTO THE EYES THAT WERE SO EARNESTLY SEEKING HERS
THERE WERE THE CALLERS TOO BEAUTIFUL LADIES IN TRAILING GOWNS WHO INSISTED UPON SEEING HER THOUGH WHY MARGARET COULD NOT UNDERSTAND FOR THEY INVARIABLY CRIED AND SAID POOR LITTLE LAMB WHEN THEY DID SEE HER
OR WERE NOT ABSURD BUT THEY CHANCED AT THE MOMENT TO BE A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT FOR HER ANGER AND DISCOMFITURE PATTY DOESN'T THINK THEM ABSURD LAUGHED MARGARET SHE WOULD TELL YOU THAT SHE NAMED THEM HERSELF
IF THE MAN HEARD HE DID NOT HEED THE BONDS OF HIS SELF CONTROL HAD SNAPPED AND THE TORRENT OF WORDS CAME WITH A FORCE THAT TOLD HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM ALONE HERE THAT I HAVE NO FRIENDS BUT YOU AND PATTY SHE WENT ON TREMULOUSLY
BESIDES I'M GOING WITH PATTY WITH PATTY
BOBBY BREATHED MARGARET IN SURPRISED DISMAY FALLING BACK BEFORE THE FIRE IN THE EYES THAT SUDDENLY TURNED AND FLASHED STRAIGHT INTO HERS
INTERPOSED MARGARET EAGERLY I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT AND I'LL HELP ABOUT THAT PART
GONE SHE IS BAG AND BAGGAGE OH I'M SO SORRY MURMURED MISSUS KENDALL POOH TAIN'T A MITE O MATTER ASSURED PATTY QUICKLY YE SEE DAR WA'N'T NOTHIN IN IT ANYHOW ONLY A EXTRY RIBB'N FUR ARABELLA'S HAIR
NO NO SHE CRIED NEVER I THINK I SHOULD SIMPLY CRAWL FOR FEAR THAT UNDER THE WHEELS SOMEWHERE WOULD BE A CHILD A DOG A CHICKEN OR EVEN A HELPLESS WORM SOMETHING THAT MOVED AND THAT I MIGHT HURT
SAM'S JEST A LEARNIN MAGGIE TER SAY SHE'S TWELVE EVEN NOW AN THE MINUTE SHE'S BIG ENOUGH TER WORK SHE WILL BE TWELVE IT MAKES ME JEST SICK AN THAT'S WHY I CAN'T BEAR TER HEAR HER SAY IT MARGARET SHUDDERED
AND THE SETTING SUN PEEPED THROUGH THE VINES OUTSIDE AND GLISTENED ON THE OLD FAMILY PLATE THREE GENERATIONS OF SPENCERS LOOKED DOWN FROM THE WALLS ON THE TWO MEN AND THE WOMAN SITTING AT THE GREAT MAHOGANY TABLE THE TWO MEN AND THE WOMAN HOWEVER
PRECIPITATELY TWO MINUTES LATER BOBBY MC GINNIS HIMSELF STOOD TALL AND STRAIGHT JUST INSIDE THE DOOR YOU SENT FOR ME HE ASKED MARGARET SPRANG TO HER FEET ALL THE PENT LONELINESS OF THE PAST WEEKS AND MONTHS
OTHERWISE SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HER HOME WITH THEM LONG AGO AT FIRST IT WAS MARGARET'S PLAN TO RECTIFY THIS LITTLE MISTAKE IMMEDIATELY
BUT MY DEAR MARGARET ARGUED THE MAN THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH IT IT'S NO FAILURE AT ALL YOU'VE DONE WONDERS DOWN THERE AT THE MILL HOUSE MARGARET SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY IT'S SO LITTLE
WHEN MARGARET RAN DOWN TO MEET HIM AT THE GREAT DRIVEWAY GATE BACK ON THE VERANDA PATTY AND THE OTHERS WERE PLAYING HOUSEKEEPING AND MARGARET SPOKE LOW
HE LEANED FORWARD AND COVERED THE SLIM FINGERS WITH HIS OWN WARM CLASPING HAND MARGARET DEAR CHILD DON'T HE BEGGED IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS YOU ARE CARRYING THE WHOLE WORLD ON THOSE TWO FRAIL SHOULDERS OF YOURS
AND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND IT ONLY GREW STRONGER AND DEEPER UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT ME IN ALL THIS WORLD BUT YOU JUST YOU AND NOW MARGARET MY MARGARET HE SAID SOFTLY AND VERY TENDERLY
SHE HELD A BOOK BEFORE HER BUT SHE WAS NOT READING AND SHE LOOKED UP AT ONCE WHEN PATTY ENTERED THE ROOM I'M SORRY TER TROUBLE YE BEGAN PATTY HESITATINGLY BUT BOBBY MC GINNIS IS HERE AN WANTED ME TER ASK YE
WAS ON THE PLATFORM BEFORE THE WHEELS HAD CEASED TO TURN BEHIND HIM TUMBLED PETER MARY AND CLARABELLA WHILE PATTY CAREFULLY GUIDING ARABELLA'S TWISTED FEET BROUGHT UP THE REAR THERE WAS AN INSTANT'S PAUSE
WHILE MISSUS MERIDETH AND HER BROTHERS WERE PLAINLY FIGHTING A LOSING CONTEST AGAINST A RESTLESSNESS THAT SENT A HAUNTING FEAR TO THEIR EYES MARGARET
LITTLE BULLETINS FROM THE SICK ROOM THEN HAD COME THE GOOD NEWS THAT FRANK WAS OUT OF DANGER THOUGH STILL FAR TOO WEAK TO UNDERTAKE THE LONG JOURNEY HOME THEIR LETTERS SHOWED UNMISTAKABLY THEIR IMPATIENCE AT THE DELAY AND QUESTIONED HER AS TO HER HEALTH AND WELFARE
PATTY AND HER FAMILY WILL LIVE WITH ME AND WE ARE GOING TO OPEN CLASSES IN SIMPLE LITTLE THINGS THAT WILL HELP TOWARD BETTER LIVING BUT THAT IS REGULAR SETTLEMENT WORK SIGHED MISSUS MERIDETH
AND SHE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM THE MAN DROPPED BACK IN HIS CHAIR HIS FACE WHITE SHE DOES NOT LOVE ME AND NO WONDER
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE EAGERLY AS THE CHILDREN HAD FOLLOWED TOM'S LEAD THEY STOOD ABASHED NOW BEFORE THE TALL BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND THE PRETTY LITTLE GIRL THEY HAD ONCE KNOWN AS MAG OF THE ALLEY ALMOST INSTANTLY
MARGARET FLUSHED A LITTLE AND THREW A QUESTIONING LOOK INTO BOBBY'S FACE THERE SEEMED TO BE A LAUGH IN BOBBY'S VOICE THOUGH THERE WAS NONE ON HIS LIPS YES SHE NODDED HURRIEDLY YOU SEE
ROSY AN KATY TER SCHOOL I WAS CAL'LATIN TER MAKE SOMETHIN OF EM MORE'N THEIR DAD AN THEIR MAMMY IS BUT I RECKON AS HOW I'LL HAVE TER SET EM TER WORK OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T REMONSTRATED MARGARET
THEN WHAT YE CRYIN BOUT YOU AIN'T BOUND BY NO CONTRACT YOU DON'T HAVE TER DIVVY UP BUT I OUGHT TO DIVVY UP
IF I CORRECT EACH ONE TWILL BE A CONTINUAL DON'T ALL DAY WHY DOCTOR THE CHILD WILL HATE ME
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO ME FRANKLY AND FREELY AND TELL ME THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER THE MAN HAD HALF TURNED HIS FACE SO THAT ONLY HIS PROFILE SHOWED CLEAN CUT AND SQUARE CHINNED AGAINST THE CLOSE SHUT DOOR
WERE SACRIFICED ALL THE LIFE AND STRENGTH OF WHATEVER WAS THEIRS THE MINUTE SUCH A MAN'S BOYS AND GIRLS WERE BIG ENOUGH AND TALL ENOUGH TO BE SWORN IN HE GOT THE PAPERS AND SET THEM TO WORK
THE ONE CREED OF HER LIFE IS TO DIVVY UP AND HOW I'M GOING TO TEACH HER ORDINARY IDEAS OF LIVING WITHOUT SHATTERING ALL HER FAITH IN ME I DON'T KNOW WHY HARRY MISSUS KENDALL'S VOICE WAS TRAGIC
LEFT HER NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER NOT BUT THAT SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE TWO FAMILIES THAT HAD BEEN SO GOOD TO MARGARET IN HER HOUR OF NEED BUT SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SHOW THAT GRATITUDE IN SOME WAY NOT QUITE SO INTIMATE AS TAKING THEM INTO HER HOUSE AND HOME
AND THEN UNDER ONLY SUCH AS A CITY MISSIONARY AND AN OVERWORKED SCHOOLTEACHER COULD AFFORD SUPPLEMENTED BY THE TWO TRIPS TO MONT LAWN TO BE SURE BEHIND IT ALL HAD BEEN MARGARET'S CAREFUL TRAINING FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE
MARGARET PAUSED HER EYES STILL AVERTED THEN SUDDENLY SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MAN SITTING IN SILENT DISMAY AT THE DESK DON'T YOU SEE SHE CRIED I HAVE CROSSED THE LINE
AND PETER OF THE WHALEN FAMILY LEAVING THE REST OF THE CHILDREN AND MISSUS WHALEN TO KEEP OLD MIKE WHALEN COMPANY
I WANT TO DO IT IT'S FOR PATTY YOU KNOW AND FRANK SPENCER COULD ONLY FALL BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH AN UNEASY GLANCE AT HIS SISTER BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT
ONE MIGHT SEE THE TOWN WITH ITS MYRIAD ROOFS AND TALL CHIMNEYS BUT ALTHOUGH THESE SAME TALL CHIMNEYS REPRESENTED THE WEALTH THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE GREAT SPENCER ESTATE
DOUBTLESS THAT WAS HALF THE CAUSE OF HER PRESENT RESTLESSNESS AND UNHAPPINESS SHE HAD LOVED HIM ALL THE TIME AND DID NOT KNOW IT SURELY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD SO WISELY HELP HER IN HER DEAR WORK
AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HAD FOLLOWED PATTY'S ELABORATELY FLOURISHED SCRAWL MUCH OBLIGED FOR DE INVITE AN WES ACOMIN TANKS CLARABELLA ARABELLA AN PATTY AT YER SERVICE
LUCKY STARS AS THE CHILD INSISTED UPON CALLING HER AND MAGGIE WERE FIRM FRIENDS GOOD FOOD AND PROPER CARE WERE FAST BRINGING THE LITTLE GIRL BACK TO HEALTH
BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET ON IN SCHOOL CONSCIOUS THAT THERE MUST BE A SCHOOL LAW MARGARET WENT VIGOROUSLY TO WORK TO FIND AND ENFORCE IT THEN AND NOT UNTIL THEN DID SHE REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS
WAS IT NOT AFTER ALL THE VERY BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHERE AND HOW COULD SHE DO MORE GOOD IN THE WORLD THAN RIGHT HERE WITH THIS STRONG LOVING HEART TO HELP HER SHE LOVED HIM TOO
STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART HARRY
SHE'S HOME NOW IN HER OWN MOTHER'S ARMS
FOR A MONTH NOW BOBBY HAD SWEPT THE FLOOR AND DUSTED THE BOOKS IN THE LAW OFFICE OF BURT AND BURT TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING ERRANDS AND TENDING DOOR IN DAYS GONE BY THE LAW AS REPRESENTED BY THE POLICEMAN ON THE CORNER WAS SOMETHING TO BE AVOIDED
TO TOM PETER MARY PATTY ARABELLA AND CLARABELLA IT WAS ALL SO WONDERFUL THAT THEY FAIRLY PINCHED THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE AWAKE THE DRIVE THROUGH THE ELM BORDERED STREETS WITH EVERYWHERE FLOWERS
BURST FORTH IN A STINGING WHIP OF RETORT YES I SENT FOR YOU SHE PAUSED BUT THE MAN DID NOT SPEAK AND IN A MOMENT SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY FEVERISHLY I ALWAYS SEND FOR YOU IF I SEE YOU AT ALL AND YET YOU KNOW HOW HARD I'M TRYING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
HIS EYES WIDELY OPENED AT THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME TO HER FACE OH NOTHING RETURNED MISSUS KENDALL ALMOST DESPAIRINGLY ONLY IF YOU'D SEEN JOE BAGLEY YESTERDAY MORNING I'M AFRAID YOU'D
YOU SEE I'VE FOUND ANOTHER OF MY FRIENDS IT'S THE LITTLE GIRL PATTY WITH WHOM I LIVED THREE YEARS IN NEW YORK SHE'S DOWN IN ONE OF THE MILL COTTAGES AND IT LEAKS AND IS IN BAD SHAPE GENERALLY I WANT TO FIX IT UP
AT FIRST I DID NOT ASK HER OF COURSE IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION AS SHE WAS FEELING SOME ONE OF HER TEACHERS ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR HER THEY ALL PITIED HER AND NATURALLY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD FOR HER AS DID HER MATES AT SCHOOL
HAD SEWED ON BUTTONS IN THE ATTIC SWEAT SHOP AND PASTED BAGS IN THE ILL SMELLING CELLAR THE STORY OF THE COOPERATIVE HOUSEKEEPING ESTABLISHMENT IN ONE CORNER OF THE BASEMENT KITCHEN WHERE SHE TOGETHER WITH PATTY AND THE TWINS DIVVIED UP THE DAY'S HAUL
IN RESPONSE TO FRANK SPENCER'S AMAZED EJACULATION BUT WHAT PERHAPS I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HE MURMURED NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T REPLIED MARGARET AND NO WONDER I'LL EXPLAIN
CHAPTER TWELVE THE GREAT DINING ROOM AT HILCREST THE OLD SPENCER HOMESTEAD WAS PERHAPS THE PLEASANTEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE THE HOUSE ITSELF CROWNED THE HIGHEST HILL THAT OVERLOOKED THE TOWN
AND THIS PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT TO THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRIALS FOR HERSELF AS WELL AS FOR HER MOTHER
SO SUPPOSE WE DON'T TAKE ANY OF THE WHALENS THIS TIME JUST DEVOTE OURSELVES TO PATTY AND THE TWINS TO THIS HOWEVER MARGARET REFUSED TO GIVE HER CONSENT WHAT NOT TAKE ANY OF THE WHALENS
HE'S CROSS MOSTLY SHE EXPLAINED TO HER MOTHER BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE JUST HIM BEHIND
ONLY A FEW ENROLLED THEMSELVES AS PUPILS NEVER MIND SAID MARGARET WE SHALL GROW YOU'LL SEE THE MILL PEOPLE HOWEVER WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT LEARNED SOMETHING DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS MARGARET HERSELF LEARNED MUCH
HE REPLIED SIMPLY YOU DON'T KNOW BUT SURELY YOU HAVE SEEN HER YES OH YES I HAVE SEEN HER ONCE OR TWICE BUT MARGARET KENDALL IS NOT A GIRL WHOM TO SEE IS TO KNOW BESIDES THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUCH THAT WELL
I CROSSED IT LONG AGO WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL I DO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUNGRY AND COLD AND HOMELESS I DO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO FIGHT THE WORLD WITH ONLY TWO SMALL EMPTY HANDS
NO I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS HOWEVER HE ADDED IT SEEMS THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HER RETURN TO HER MOTHER'S HOME SHE HAD THE MOST ABSURD QUIXOTIC NOTIONS ABOUT SHARING ALL SHE HAD WITH EVERY RAGAMUFFIN IN NEW YORK
SHE WOULD NOT COME WITH ME AND SHE HAD NO PEOPLE OF HER OWN TO WHOM SHE COULD TURN FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AS YOU KNOW POOR HARRY WAS CONSCIOUS FOR SOME HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS WILL AND DICTATE THE LETTER TO ME
OF NECESSITY A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT AND TO MISSUS KENDALL'S CONSTERNATION
IN THE MILLS AT TWELVE YEARS OLD THAT'S THE AGE YE KNOW WHEN THEY CAN GIT THEIR PAPERS THAT IS IF IT'S SUMMER VACATION TIME
COME COME NED DON'T BE FOOLISH HE PROTESTED YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOUR BROTHER'S STEPDAUGHTER HAS BEEN MY WARD FOR A DOZEN YEARS YES BUT THAT IS ALL I KNOW REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN QUIETLY I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER AND SCARCELY EVER HEARD OF HER
I DO HOPE THE CHILD IS WELL OVER THOSE NOTIONS I SHOULDN'T WANT HER TO MIX UP HERE WITH THE MILL PEOPLE I NEVER DID QUITE LIKE THOSE SETTLEMENT WOMEN ANYWAY AND ONLY THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH ONE IN ONE'S OWN FAMILY I DON'T THINK I SHOULD WORRY SISTER SWEET
IF THAT MAN SHOULD BE BAD TO MY MOTHER I THINK I'D KILL HIM BOBBY ROUSED HIMSELF HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED JOE BAGLEY AND THE KITTEN WHAT MAN HE ASKED DOCTOR SPENCER DOCTOR SPENCER
THEY WEIGHED TOO HEAVILY ON YOUR HEART YOU YOU WERE MORBID MY DEAR I KNOW SHE SAID I UNDERSTAND BETTER NOW EVERY ONE TRIED TO INTEREST ME TO AMUSE ME TO MAKE ME FORGET
THERE WAS THE SKILLED PHYSICIAN SUMMONED TO PRESCRIBE FOR MAGGIE AND THERE WAS THE STRONG CAPABLE WOMAN HIRED TO CARE FOR HER AND TO GIVE THE WORN OUT MOTHER A MUCH NEEDED REST THERE WERE THE LARGE BASKETS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
I'LL DRAW IT UP FOR YOU THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT HE EXPLAINED AIRILY AND AS MARGARET BUBBLED OVER WITH DELIGHT AND THANKS HE ADDED NOT AT ALL TAIN'T NOTHIN
BUT HER FACE GLOWED WITH A STRANGE EXALTATION OF HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO FALTERED THE MAN MARGARET FLUSHED AND LEANED FORWARD EAGERLY I AM GOING TO DO ALL THAT I CAN
HE QUESTIONED NO MOTHER SPRESSLY STIP'LATED THAT I SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR STAYIN ALWAYS TILL THEIR VISIT WAS OVER
BESIDES IF HE'S GOIN TO LIVE HERE WHY HE MIGHT AS WELL COME RIGHT NOW AT THE FIRST NO CERTAINLY WE COULDN'T LEAVE MISTER WHALEN BEHIND ALONE MISSUS KENDALL HAD RETURNED WITH DRY LIPS
HER FACE LOST A LITTLE OF ITS RADIANT GLOW AND HER HAND TREMBLED AS SHE RAISED IT TO HER HEAD YOU ARE RIGHT I DID NOT KNOW SHE SAID FAINTLY THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE THERE MUST BE
DID YOU EVER KNOW ANY HUSBANDS THAT WAS GOOD HUSBANDS GOOD WHAT DO YE MEAN DID YOU EVER KNOW ANY THAT WAS GOOD I MEAN THAT DIDN'T BEAT THEIR WIVES AND BANG EM ROUND DID YOU BOBBY BOBBY LAUGHED
HE WENT HOME TO THE LITTLE RED FARMHOUSE ON THE HILL AND SPENT AN HOUR HUNTING FOR A CERTAIN BOOK OF HIS MOTHER'S IN THE ATTIC WHEN HE HAD FOUND IT HE SPENT ANOTHER HOUR PORING OVER ITS CONTENTS
SCOFFED BOBBY HAIN'T FOLKS GOT A RIGHT TER HAVE THEIR OWN THINGS MARGARET FROWNED DOUBTFULLY I DON'T KNOW SHE BEGAN WITH SOME HESITATION IF I'VE GOT NICE THINGS AND MORE OF EM THAN PATTY HAS
HIS SHOULDERS STRAIGHTENED THANK YE MISS
IN THE BARN TOO THERE WAS NOW A STALWART FELLOW WHO WAS COACHMAN AND CHAUFFEUR BY TURNS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE OLD FAMILY CARRIAGE OR THE NEW FOUR CYLINDER TOURING CAR WAS WANTED
BUT THAT AIN'T ALL WAILED MARGARET AND SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT AT ONE OF HER WORDS BOBBY CHUCKLED AND PARTED HIS LIPS ONLY TO CLOSE THEM AGAIN WITH A SNAP
ANY MORE WON'T HAVE TO STAY AWAY THE MAN WAS ON HIS FEET INCREDULOUS WONDER IN HIS EYES NO WE WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER THIS WORK
ONLY ON THAT ONE CONDITION MARGARET SMILED BUT SHE MADE NO COMMENT IT WAS ENOUGH TO FIGHT PRESENT BATTLES WITHOUT TRYING TO WIN FUTURE ONES
WHAT IT WAS TO BE PRESSED BY A DOZEN LITTLE SCAMPERING FEET AT ONCE AND THE GREAT STONE LIONS KNEW
AND THE BOXES OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS IN FACT THERE SEEMED TO BE ALMOST NOTHING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WEEK THAT WAS NOT FOR PATTY YOU KNOW EVEN MARGARET'S TIME THAT TOO WAS GIVEN TO PATTY
BUT IF MARGARET WAS GOING TO NEW YORK THAT ALTERED THE CASE OH
AND MISSUS KENDALL WHO HEARD THE WORDS REPROACHED HERSELF BECAUSE FOR FOUR LONG WEEKS SHE HAD STOOD JEALOUS GUARD OVER THIS HEAVEN AND REFUSED TO DIVVY UP ITS ENJOYMENT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE SHUDDERED
NODDED MARGARET AND NOT LIKE A HUSBAND BOBBY LAUGHED THEN HE FROWNED AND WAS SILENT SUDDENLY HIS FACE CHANGED I SAY YOU MIGHT MAKE HIM SIGN A CONTRACT HE HAZARDED CONTRACT SURE
SHE STAYED AT THE BERKSHIRE SCHOOL FIVE YEARS THEN WITH SOME FEAR AND TREMBLING I OWN I WENT TO SEE HER I FOUND A GRAVE EYED LITTLE MISS WHO ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS WITH STUDIED POLITENESS
SHE HAD SOUGHT OUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AND ASKED THEIR HELP AND ADVICE SHE WAS APPALLED AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO APPEARED SCARCELY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS SCHOOL THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS
IT'S BUSINESS AGAIN SHE BEGAN SMILING FAINTLY AND IT'S THE MILLS MAY I SPEAK TO YOU A MOMENT OF COURSE YOU MAY
WITH THE OTHER I MAKE MORE CHILDREN HUNGRY AND MORE WOMEN SICK MARGARET ARE YOU MAD WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MERELY THIS IT IS VERY SIMPLE AFTER ALL WITH ONE HAND I RELIEVE THE CHILDREN'S SUFFERING WITH THE OTHER
WINSOME GIRL MEANT TO HIM IT CAME TO HIM NOW WITH THE STAGGERING FORCE OF A BLOW IN THE FACE AND SHE WAS GOING AWAY TO FRANK SPENCER THE DAYS SUDDENLY STRETCHED AHEAD IN EMPTY USELESSNESS
THAT WOULD SPOIL EVERYTHING DON'T YOU SEE THAT YOU MUSTN'T THEY MUST GO TO SCHOOL GET AN EDUCATION THE MAN GAZED AT HER WITH DULL EYES THEY GOT TER EAT FIRST HE SAID YES YES I KNOW
SHE HELD HER HANDS BEFORE HER FACE AND SCREAMED IF I SO MUCH AS CAME INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A CHILD OF COURSE AND NOT EVEN A NORMAL ONE AT THAT FOR SHE HAD HAD A VERY STRANGE LIFE AT FIVE SHE WAS LOST IN NEW YORK CITY
AND SHE TOOK PAINS THAT HER MOTHER SHOULD SEE NAT AND TOM AND ROXY HER MOTHER HOWEVER DID NOT APPEAR TO KNOW THEM WHICH DID NOT SEEM SO VERY STRANGE TO MARGARET AFTER ALL FOR OF COURSE HER MOTHER HAD NOT KNOWN THERE WERE ANY POOR PEOPLE SO NEAR
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS ALMOST AS IF YOU WERE AFRAID I AM AFRAID
AN I'LL BE TWELVE TER MORROW MARGARET ALWAYS CHUCKLED OVER THIS RETORT AND NEVER TIRED OF HEARING IT UNTIL ONE DAY PATTY SHARPLY INTERFERED DON'T PLEASE DON'T
WHAT MORE COULD YOU DO VENTURED THE MAN MARGARET ROSE AND MOVED RESTLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID AT LAST
FROM FLOWERS AND FROSTED CAKES
VINE COVERED HOUSES AND VELVETY LAWNS IT WAS ALL QUITE UNBELIEVABLE IT'S MORE LIKE MONT LAWN THAN ANYTHIN I EVER SEE MURMURED ARABELLA
THAT MARGARET ONCE MORE SAID TO HER GUARDIAN THAT SHE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND ON BUSINESS FRANK SPENCER TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WAS USED TO THIS SORT OF THING NOW AND THAT HE WAS RESIGNED TO THE INEVITABLE
THE MAN SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND WALKED TWICE THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM THEN HE TURNED ABOUT AND FACED THE SCORNFUL EYES OF THE GIRL BY THE DESK MARGARET DON'T LOOK AT ME AS IF YOU THOUGHT I WAS A FIEND INCARNATE
THAT HE DISPLAYED THE RESULT OF HIS LABOR TO HIS CLIENT THEN WITH HER GLEEFUL WORDS OF APPROVAL STILL RINGING IN HIS EARS HE SLIPPED IT INTO ITS ENVELOPE SEALED STAMPED AND POSTED IT
WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE SUNLIGHT THE VINES OR THE SWAYING CURTAINS THEY WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES WERE TROUBLED AND QUESTIONING YOU SAY SHE IS COMING NEXT WEEK ASKED THE YOUNGER MAN GLANCING AT THE LETTER IN THE OTHER'S HAND
NO NO OF COURSE NOT MURMURED THE DOCTOR HASTILY THOUGH HIS EYES STILL GLOWED IT WON'T DO OF COURSE BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER HER LIFE HER STRUGGLE FOR VERY EXISTENCE ALL THOSE YEARS SHE HAD TO TRAIN HER FISTS TO FIGHT HER WAY
