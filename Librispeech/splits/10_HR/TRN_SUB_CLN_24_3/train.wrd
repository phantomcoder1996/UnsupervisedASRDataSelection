THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVE NURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM
ENTERTAINED BY EVERYBODY INTIMATE WITH EVERYBODY AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR LUGGAGE FROM THE HOTEL AND HAD GONE TO STAY WITH MISSUS WESTGATE
THAT HE ONE DAY TOLD THE KING OF THE LAND WHO USED TO COME AND HUNT IN THE WOOD THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SPIN GOLD OUT OF STRAW NOW THIS KING WAS VERY FOND OF MONEY
I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONE OCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEE BUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT AN END
AND HE ADDED THAT MISTER WESTGATE HAD SEEMED VERY UNEASY LEST HIS WIFE SHOULD MISS HER VISITOR HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH AN AWFUL HURRY TO SEND HIM BACK TO HER I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER COME UP TO AN AMERICAN HUSBAND IF THAT'S WHAT THE WIVES EXPECT HE SAID TO LORD LAMBETH
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE MEMORY OF THIS PROMISE THAT MADE HIM SAY TO HIS COMPANION A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THAT HE RATHER WONDERED HE SHOULD BE SO FOND OF THAT GIRL IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW FOND I AM OF HER ASKED LORD LAMBETH
AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESS LAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GOD'S SAKE IS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER HOW ILL YOU ARE
I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSE BEAT RAPIDLY I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAME PLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD
AND AS SOON AS HER LITTLE FRIEND CAME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER THRONE AND CALLED ALL HER COURT ROUND TO ENJOY THE FUN AND THE NURSE STOOD BY HER SIDE WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS AS IF IT WAS QUITE READY TO BE GIVEN UP
AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
NOW THE QUEEN LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING OF ALL THE ODD NAMES THAT SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND SHE SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE LAND TO FIND OUT NEW ONES THE NEXT DAY THE LITTLE MAN CAME AND SHE BEGAN WITH TIMOTHY
THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THE PANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THE HALF EXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATURE OPEN IT BREATHED HARD
ALL THIS MUST BE SPUN INTO GOLD BEFORE MORNING AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE POOR MAIDEN SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY A SILLY BOAST OF HER FATHER
HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
AT OTHERS I NEARLY SANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS MINGLED WITH THIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
MISSUS WESTGATE HOWEVER WAS NOT TO ENJOY MUCH LONGER THE ENTERTAINMENT WITH WHICH AN INDULGENT HUSBAND HAD DESIRED TO KEEP HER PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF AUGUST LORD LAMBETH RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIS MOTHER
TO EVERY ONE OF THEM MADAM THAT IS NOT MY NAME THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE MESSENGERS CAME BACK AND SAID I HAVE TRAVELLED TWO DAYS WITHOUT HEARING OF ANY OTHER NAMES BUT YESTERDAY AS I WAS CLIMBING A HIGH HILL
COLERIDGE'S ANCIENT MARINER CONTINUING THUS I CAME AT LENGTH OPPOSITE TO THE INN AT WHICH THE VARIOUS DILIGENCES AND CARRIAGES USUALLY STOPPED HERE I PAUSED I KNEW NOT WHY
COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
THEN SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE TO WEEP BUT THE DWARF SOON OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO DO YOUR TASK THE RING ON MY FINGER SAID SHE
THOUGH IF IT WERE CONVENIENT I MIGHT PRESENT A RECORD OF IMPRESSIONS NONETHELESS DELECTABLE THAT THEY WERE NOT EXHAUSTIVELY ANALYZED MANY OF THEM STILL LINGER IN THE MINDS OF OUR TRAVELERS ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF HARMONIOUS IMAGES
THEY WERE INDULGING IN PRACTICES THAT IMPARTED A SHADE OF HYPOCRISY TO THE LADY'S REGRET FOR HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE I ASSURE YOU WE ARE ALWAYS DISCUSSING AND DIFFERING SAID PERCY BEAUMONT SHE IS AWFULLY ARGUMENTATIVE
LORD LAMBETH MADE HIS FAREWELLS BUT THE FEW LAST WORDS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH BESSIE ALDEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR RECORD
HER FEATURES APPEARED TO CHANGE AND I THOUGHT THAT I HELD THE CORPSE OF MY DEAD MOTHER IN MY ARMS A SHROUD ENVELOPED HER FORM AND I SAW THE GRAVE WORMS CRAWLING IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLANNEL I STARTED FROM MY SLEEP WITH HORROR
I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE IN MY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME AS CHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION
DAMN MY EYES EXCLAIMED LORD LAMBETH IF ONE IS TO BE A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AT THE HOUSE IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT TO SLEEP THERE I AM SICK OF TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THIS BEASTLY AVENUE
WHAT AM I TO DO PERCY BEAUMONT WAS ANNOYED AS WELL HE HAD DEEMED IT HIS DUTY AS I HAVE NARRATED TO WRITE TO THE DUCHESS BUT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT THIS DISTINGUISHED WOMAN WOULD ACT SO PROMPTLY UPON HIS HINT
BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROM YOU SO SELDOM BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIR ACCOUNT MYSELF
PERCY BEAUMONT RETURNED WITH HIS COUSIN AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY COMPELLED HIM ONE WINDLESS AFTERNOON IN MID ATLANTIC
THAT'S A GREAT PITY SAID BEAUMONT YOU WOULD FIND IT ALL SET FORTH THERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN DO IT HE IS A PEER THEN OH YES HE IS A PEER AND HAS HE ANY OTHER TITLE THAN LORD LAMBETH
I IMAGINED THAT THE MONSTER SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY AND FELL DOWN IN A FIT POOR CLERVAL WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS A MEETING WHICH HE ANTICIPATED WITH SUCH JOY
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IS SHE VERY PLAIN BEAUMONT BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN YOU WOULD NOT FIND HER SO HANDSOME AS HER BROTHER HE SAID
REEL AWAY REEL AWAY STRAW INTO GOLD AND ROUND ABOUT THE WHEEL WENT MERRILY THE WORK WAS QUICKLY DONE AND THE STRAW WAS ALL SPUN INTO GOLD
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
OF COURSE I NEEDN'T ASSURE YOU HE SAID THAT IF YOU SHOULD COME TO ENGLAND NEXT YEAR I EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU INFORM OF IT BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE AND SHE SMILED
AND WHEN HE HEARD THE MILLER'S BOAST HIS GREEDINESS WAS RAISED AND HE SENT FOR THE GIRL TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THEN HE LED HER TO A CHAMBER IN HIS PALACE WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND GAVE HER A SPINNING WHEEL AND SAID
FROM A HIGH POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE VERY INSPIRING THE LESS ONE THINKS OF IT THE BETTER LORD LAMBETH AFFIRMED I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUS SAID BESSIE ALDEN AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY TENANTRY
I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE
RUMPELSTILTSKIN SAID THE LADY SLYLY SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT CRIED THE LITTLE MAN AND DASHED HIS RIGHT FOOT IN A RAGE SO DEEP INTO THE FLOOR THAT HE WAS FORCED TO LAY HOLD OF IT WITH BOTH HANDS TO PULL IT OUT
THEN THE LITTLE MAN BEGAN TO CHUCKLE AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THE POOR CHILD TO TAKE HOME WITH HIM TO HIS HUT IN THE WOODS AND HE CRIED OUT NOW LADY WHAT IS MY NAME IS IT JOHN ASKED SHE
WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY I COLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE A SPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET IT WAS ALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING
AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEAR TO MY RECOLLECTION I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORROR AND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHS CALM AND SERENE JOY
AND HE HAD A STRONG INCORRUPTIBLE SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES OF LIFE HIS KINSMAN MEANWHILE WAS HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TALK WITH BESSIE ALDEN ON THE RED SEA ROCKS BEYOND THE LAWN
THIS YOUNG LADY NO LONGER APPLIED TO PERCY BEAUMONT FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS LORDSHIP SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF DIRECTLY TO THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH BORED HIM A LITTLE
HEREUPON IT WAS THAT AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS A LITTLE BORED DO YOU WANT TO BUY UP THEIR LEASES HE ASKED WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY LIVINGS SHE DEMANDED OH I SAY HE CRIED
IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING ME INSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
AND ARE HIS PARENTS LIVING OH YES IF HIS FATHER WERE NOT LIVING HE WOULD BE A DUKE
CLERVAL AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED MY UNUSUAL SPIRITS TO JOY ON HIS ARRIVAL BUT WHEN HE OBSERVED ME MORE ATTENTIVELY HE SAW A WILDNESS IN MY EYES FOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT
PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THE WRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MY VIEW I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUT FELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON
AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
I FEEL THE GREATEST REMORSE FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME YOU WILL REPAY ME ENTIRELY IF YOU DO NOT DISCOMPOSE YOURSELF BUT GET WELL AS FAST AS YOU CAN
BESSIE ALDEN APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST HE IS THE SON OF THE DUKE OF BAYSWATER HE ADDED PRESENTLY THE ELDEST SON THE ONLY SON
AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS I MAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOT I TREMBLED ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE
SO THAT WHEN HIS FATHER DIES PURSUED BESSIE ALDEN WITH MORE SIMPLICITY THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN A CLEVER GIRL HE WILL BECOME DUKE OF BAYSWATER OF COURSE SAID PERCY BEAUMONT
TO DO IT FOR YOU MY NECKLACE REPLIED THE MAIDEN HE TOOK HER AT HER WORD AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WHEEL AND WHISTLED AND SANG ROUND ABOUT ROUND ABOUT LO AND BEHOLD
MERRILY I'LL DANCE AND SING FOR NEXT DAY WILL A STRANGER BRING LITTLE DOES MY LADY DREAM RUMPELSTILTSKIN IS MY NAME WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS SHE JUMPED FOR JOY
OF UNIVERSAL FRIENDLINESS AND FRANKNESS OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY KNEW EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF EASE
HIS WIFE MORE THAN ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW BUT ON THE MORROW SHE WANDERED ABOUT A LITTLE WITH A TELEGRAM IN HER JEWELED FINGERS DECLARING IT WAS VERY TIRESOME THAT HIS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM IN NEW YORK
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILL YOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT
SHE HAS BEEN ASKING ME SAID BEAUMONT ALL ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR POSSESSIONS I AM SURE IT IS VERY GOOD OF HER LORD LAMBETH REJOINED WELL THEN OBSERVED HIS COMPANION IF YOU GO YOU GO WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS I TOOK REFUGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATEST AGITATION
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
TO SAY TO LORD LAMBETH THAT HE SUSPECTED THAT THE DUCHESS'S TELEGRAM WAS IN PART THE RESULT OF SOMETHING HE HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN TO HER I WROTE TO HER AS I EXPLICITLY NOTIFIED YOU I HAD PROMISED TO DO
DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
HIS POSITION PERCY BEAUMONT REPEATED HIS RANK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT A PEERAGE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THACKERAY
BUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A REASONABLE YOUNG MAN AND I CAN GIVE NO BETTER PROOF OF IT THAN THE FACT THAT HE REMARKED TO HIS COMPANION AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT AFTER ALL I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HER
AND THAT I AM AT LENGTH FREE I TREMBLED EXCESSIVELY I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK OF AND FAR LESS TO ALLUDE TO THE OCCURRENCES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT I WALKED WITH A QUICK PACE
HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
IT WAS LORD LAMBETH'S THEORY FREELY PROPOUNDED WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE TOGETHER THAT PERCY BEAUMONT WAS HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME WITH MISSUS WESTGATE AND THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION
BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
ONLY TO BE FAIR HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER ALSO THAT SHE IS NOT SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ME PERCY BEAUMONT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH THERE IS NOTHING SO CHARMING AS MODESTY IN A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR POSITION
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE I THEN REFLECTED AND THE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MY APARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
AMERICAN LADIES CERTAINLY DON'T MIND CONTRADICTING YOU UPON MY WORD I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER TREATED SO BY A WOMAN BEFORE SHE'S SO DEVILISH POSITIVE
GOOD MORROW TO YOU MY GOOD LASS WHAT ARE YOU WEEPING FOR ALAS SAID SHE I MUST SPIN THIS STRAW INTO GOLD AND I KNOW NOT HOW WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME SAID THE HOBGOBLIN
OF EVENINGS AT OPEN WINDOWS OR ON THE PERPETUAL VERANDAS IN THE SUMMER STARLIGHT ABOVE THE WARM ATLANTIC THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO EVERYBODY
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHY SHOULDN'T I BE FOND OF HER I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE IN YOUR LINE WHAT DO YOU CALL MY LINE YOU DON'T SET HER DOWN AS FAST EXACTLY SO
I DREADED TO BEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM
HE HAD INDEED HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HER FOR SHE WAS NOT LITERALLY ALWAYS IN CONVERSATION WITH LORD LAMBETH HE HAD MEDITATED UPON MISSUS WESTGATE'S ACCOUNT OF HER SISTER
AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
THE FIRST LITTLE CHILD THAT YOU MAY HAVE WHEN YOU ARE QUEEN THAT MAY NEVER BE THOUGHT THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER AND AS SHE KNEW NO OTHER WAY TO GET HER TASK DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO WHAT HE ASKED
ON LONG SEA ROADS BENEATH A SKY LIGHTED UP BY MARVELOUS SUNSETS OF SUPPERS ON THE RETURN INFORMAL IRREGULAR AGREEABLE
NO MADAM IS IT TOM NO MADAM IS IT JEMMY IT IS NOT CAN YOUR NAME BE
SO STRANGELY TURNED TO BITTERNESS BUT I WAS NOT THE WITNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR I WAS LIFELESS AND DID NOT RECOVER MY SENSES FOR A LONG LONG TIME
I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANT ANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCH SCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINS A YEAR WITHOUT GREEK
BUT HIS FATHER IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HIS MOTHER BEAUMONT SMILED A LITTLE THE DUCHESS IS UNCOMMONLY ROBUST AND HAS HE ANY SISTERS YES THERE ARE TWO
MISSUS WESTGATE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE FAST GIRL IN AMERICA THAT IT'S AN ENGLISH INVENTION AND THAT THE TERM HAS NO MEANING HERE ALL THE BETTER IT'S AN ANIMAL I DETEST
IF SHE WAS SHY SHE CARRIED IT OFF VERY WELL MISTER BEAUMONT SHE HAD SAID PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LORD LAMBETH'S FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT IN ENGLAND HIS POSITION
WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFAST BUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSED ME
HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGS OF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH I CONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDER INDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE
IT MEANS HE SAID THAT YOUR FATHER IS LAID UP I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS BUT YOU HAVE NO OPTION TAKE THE FIRST STEAMER BUT DON'T BE ALARMED
A STEP TO WHICH PERCY BEAUMONT AT FIRST OFFERED SOME CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION I CALL HIS OPPOSITION CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUNDED UPON SOME TALK THAT HE HAD HAD ON THE SECOND DAY WITH BESSIE ALDEN
AND WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ONE OF THEM IS MARRIED SHE IS THE COUNTESS OF PIMLICO AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS UNMARRIED SHE IS PLAIN LADY JULIA
THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY OFF WHILE THE NURSE LAUGHED AND THE BABY CROWED AND ALL THE COURT JEERED AT HIM FOR HAVING HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING AND SAID
A MUMMY AGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH I HAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION
IS IT AN IMPORTANT POSITION SHE ASKED OH DEAR NO SAID LORD LAMBETH I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE VERY GRAND SAID BESSIE ALDEN TO POSSESS SIMPLY BY AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH THE RIGHT TO MAKE LAWS FOR A GREAT NATION
I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
HAVE YOU GOT A CLERGYMAN THAT IS LOOKING OUT BUT SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THAT HE HAD A CASTLE HE CONFESSED TO BUT ONE IT WAS THE PLACE IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHER'S ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKE ELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MY DISORDER
IN THE COURSE OF LONG ISLAND RIDES WITH A SLOW RETURN IN THE GLOWING TWILIGHT ON THE DEEP VERANDA LATE IN THE EVENING LORD LAMBETH WHO HAD STAYED AT MANY HOUSES
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOOD FORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMY HAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL
AND SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHILE SHE CONTINUED THAT SLOW PACED PROMENADE WHICH ENABLED HER WELL ADJUSTED SKIRTS TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES SO ADVANTAGEOUSLY THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA THERE WAS NO LEISURE CLASS
BUT HE WAS ABSENT ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH WITH MISTER WESTGATE'S ASSISTANCE HE COMPLETELY SETTLED THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS QUICKLY IN NEW YORK HE OBSERVED TO HIS COUSIN
HOW KIND HOW VERY GOOD YOU ARE TO ME THIS WHOLE WINTER INSTEAD OF BEING SPENT IN STUDY AS YOU PROMISED YOURSELF HAS BEEN CONSUMED IN MY SICK ROOM HOW SHALL I EVER REPAY YOU
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
AS LEXMAN GATHERED FROM A GLIMPSE OF THE CREW BY GREEKS HE SCRAMBLED ABOARD AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE WAS STANDING ON THE WHITE DECK OF THE YACHT WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING TAIL OF THE MONOPLANE KARA WAS BY HIS SIDE
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN PROVE EASILY THAT I NEVER DID MEET HIM I CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THAT DAY AS TO THE OTHER AFFAIR NOT AN OUNCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE THEN IT WAS THE OTHER MAN EXCLAIMED BRYCE
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
FORTUNATE FOR YOU MISTER FOLLIOT THAT THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ALL THAT I KNOW FOR IF THEY DID THOSE MARKS WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU DAYS AGO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOLLIOT SAT JOGGLING HIS LEG A BAD SIGN IN HIM OF RISING TEMPER
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
BUT IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALL SIGNS OF THE LAND WERE BLOTTED OUT TALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAR OF THE ENGINES DEFIED PENETRATION KARA WAS EVIDENTLY A SKILFUL PILOT
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
THAT COLLISHAW'S DEAD NOR IF ONE HAD HIS NECK BROKEN AND THE OTHER WAS POISONED BUT WHOSE HAND WAS THAT WHICH THE MASON VARNER SAW THAT MORNING WHEN BRAKE WAS FLUNG OUT OF THAT DOORWAY COME NOW WHOSE
BEFORE THE SECOND MAN SPOKE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE MURDER SAID JOHN LEXMAN LACONICALLY HE HAD ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE
WITH A GLANCE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DEEPEST WELL IN ALL WRYCHESTER UNDER THAT HE REMARKED YOU'D NEVER THINK IT IT'S A HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND MORE DRY NOW
PASSING THROUGH DRIFTING CLOUDS
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
BEFORE TESTING THE LIFE OF A CONVICT ESTABLISHMENT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME TALK OF SENDING HIM TO PARKHURST AND HERE HE TRACED THE INFLUENCE WHICH T X WOULD EXERCISE FOR PARKHURST WAS A PRISONER'S PARADISE
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
COOL IN SUMMER WARM IN WINTER MODERN FIRE GRATE YOU NOTICE
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HORSES BUT ONLY A GREAT BAT LIKE MACHINE WITH OUT STRETCHED PINIONS OF TAUT WHITE CANVAS AND BY THAT MACHINE
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
NOT MINE MY LAD ANSWERED FOLLIOT CONFIDENTLY THAT'S A FACT BRYCE HESITATED GIVING FOLLIOT A SEARCHING LOOK AND FOLLIOT NODDED SOLEMNLY I TELL YOU NOT MINE HE REPEATED I'D NAUGHT TO DO WITH IT
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SEE YOU BUT I KNOW WHAT PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD I GAVE HIM COPIES OF THOSE TWO REWARD BILLS HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT HE MIGHT MAKE A BIT AND SO HE CAME IN TO TOWN AND TO YOU WELL ASKED FOLLIOT
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
YOU'D HAVE A JOB TO GET IT RETORTED FOLLIOT SUPPOSING THAT ALL YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT ABOUT PAST MATTERS NOTHING CAN PROVE NOTHING
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
IF I HAVE MY PRICE IT'S NOT IN THE SAME COMMODITY THAT GLASSDALE WOULD WANT BUT BEFORE WE DO ANY TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING I WANT TO ADD TO MY STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE LOOK HERE WE'LL BE CANDID I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGERS THAT BRAKE
HE WANTED TO FIND THOSE TWO MEN AND BEGAN A LONG SEARCH FOR THEM LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEN MISTER FOLLIOT YOU MIGHT MENTION EM IF YOU KNOW EM ANSWERED FOLLIOT THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR ONE WAS WRAYE FALKINER WRAYE
A SHARP EXCLAMATION FROM HIM TOOK BRYCE TO HIS SIDE FOLLIOT LIFTED A SHAKING HAND AND POINTED INTO THE GARDEN THERE HE WHISPERED HELL AND WHAT'S THIS MEAN
WHEN THAT CAR COMES ABREAST OF THE GATE ASK NO QUESTIONS AND JUMP INTO IT GET DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM AND PULL A SACK OVER YOU AND DO NOT GET UP UNTIL THE CAR STOPS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO JOHN LEXMAN'S HEAD AND HE STAGGERED
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
FOLLIOT NODDED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AYE DOCTOR HE SAID AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GLASSDALE NOW BRYCE WHO WOULD HAVE CHEERFULLY HOBNOBBED WITH A MAN
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
NEVER ONCE DID HE FEEL THE CAR SLACKEN ITS PACE UNTIL WITH A GRIND OF BRAKES IT STOPPED SUDDENLY GET OUT SAID A VOICE JOHN LEXMAN THREW OFF THE COVER AND LEAPT OUT AND AS HE DID SO
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
BUT NEITHER YOU NOR THE POLICE NOR ANYBODY COULD FASTEN ME TO EITHER MATTER GRANTING ALL YOU SAY TO BE TRUE WHERE'S THE POSITIVE TRUTH WHAT ABOUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ASKED BRYCE
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
AND HAD CARRIED HIS OWN GLASS TO ANOTHER EASY CHAIR DID FOLLIOT REFER TO ANY REASON FOR BRYCE'S VISIT BUT ONCE SETTLED DOWN HE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
FROM TIME TO TIME HE CONSULTED THE COMPASS ON THE BOARD BEFORE HIM AND CHANGED HIS COURSE EVER SO SLIGHTLY PRESENTLY HE RELEASED ONE HAND FROM THE DRIVING WHEEL AND SCRIBBLING ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF PAPER WHICH WAS INSERTED IN A POCKET
BRYCE WHO HAD LIGHTED A CIGAR LOOKED ACROSS ITS SMOKE AT THE IMPERTURBABLE FACE OPPOSITE YOU'VE JUST HAD GLASSDALE HERE HE OBSERVED QUIETLY I SAW HIM LEAVE YOU
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
THE TWO OR THREE CHAIRS WERE DEEP AND BIG ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN THE TWO WINDOWS COMMANDED PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS ON ONE SIDE AND OF THE CLOSE ON THE OTHER NICE LITTLE PLACE TO BE ALONE IN D'YE SEE SAID FOLLIOT
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
MY GOD HE WHISPERED DO AS I TELL YOU HISSED THE WARDER LIKE AN AUTOMATON JOHN PUT DOWN HIS BRUSHES AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE GATE THE GREY CAR WAS CRAWLING UP THE HILL
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
YOU HAVEN'T TIME FOR ARGUMENT THEY DISCOVERED YOUR ESCAPE HE SAID GET IN JOHN CLAMBERED UP INTO THE FRAIL BODY OF THE MACHINE AND KARA FOLLOWED THIS IS A SELF STARTER HE SAID ONE OF THE NEWEST MODELS OF MONOPLANES
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
LOTS ANSWERED BRYCE I CAME TO TELL YOU ON SEEING THAT GLASSDALE HAD BEEN WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH GLASSDALE THIS MORNING FOLLIOT MADE NO ANSWER
WE WOULD GET SUDDENLY WELL AGAIN AND BE BETTER THAN EVER SUCH IS LIFE AND WE ARE BUT AS GRASS THAT IS CUT DOWN AND PUT INTO THE OVEN AND BAKED TO GO BACK TO THE CARVED OAK QUESTION
THAT I WAS STEERING AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WE HAD GOT MIXED UP A GOOD DEAL WITH THE TOW PATH
NOW DREW NEARER AND NOW DIED AWAY AND ALL WAS DEATH LIKE SILENCE SAVE THE BEATING OF ONE'S OWN HEART WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SUN WE MEN AND WOMEN WE LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE
BUT THERE I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY CARE FOR IT WHEN IT CAME TO ACTUAL PRACTICE
YEARS LATER TO THE CRASH OF BATTLE MUSIC SAXON KINGS AND SAXON REVELRY WERE BURIED SIDE BY SIDE AND KINGSTON'S GREATNESS PASSED AWAY FOR A TIME TO RISE ONCE MORE WHEN HAMPTON COURT BECAME THE PALACE OF THE TUDORS AND THE STUARTS
HE WAS NEVER WITHOUT A COLD EXCEPT ONCE FOR NINE WEEKS WHILE HE HAD SCARLET FEVER AND HE ALWAYS HAD CHILBLAINS DURING THE GREAT CHOLERA SCARE OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SINGULARLY FREE FROM IT
OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHERS WHY ALL OUR ART TREASURES OF TO DAY ARE ONLY THE DUG UP COMMONPLACES OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO I WONDER IF THERE IS REAL INTRINSIC BEAUTY IN THE OLD SOUP PLATES BEER MUGS AND CANDLE SNUFFERS THAT WE PRIZE SO NOW
WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK SHOULD HAVE HIS DRAWING ROOM PANELLED WITH IT
AND SPECULATE AS TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT DOG
THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS AND WHEN HE GOT IN
FOR THE SAKE OF BEING ILL FOR A DAY
AND KNEW HOW TO PAINT I COULD MAKE A LOVELY SKETCH OF THAT OLD WALL I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT HAMPTON COURT
PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND PAID FOR IT THEN AND THERE THE SHOPMAN HE KNOWS MY FRIEND
PERHAPS FROM THE CASEMENT STANDING HAND IN HAND THEY WERE WATCHING THE CALM MOONLIGHT ON THE RIVER WHILE FROM THE DISTANT HALLS THE BOISTEROUS REVELRY FLOATED IN BROKEN BURSTS OF FAINT HEARD DIN AND TUMULT THEN BRUTAL ODO
THE WORLD SEEMS SO LONESOME AND WE GET FRIGHTENED LIKE CHILDREN IN A SILENT HOUSE THEN WE SIT AND SOB AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES AND THE ANSWERING THROB OF HUMAN LIFE WE FEEL SO HELPLESS AND SO LITTLE IN THE GREAT STILLNESS
AS ANCIENT ENGLISH CURIOS AT THIS POINT HARRIS THREW AWAY THE SCULLS GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR MONTMORENCY
IT IS A SHOP NOW IN THE MARKET PLACE BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY ONCE THE MANSION OF SOME GREAT PERSONAGE
AND BRIGHT CLOAKED GALLANTS SWAGGERED DOWN THE WATER STEPS TO CRY WHAT FERRY HO GADZOOKS GRAMERCY MANY OF THE OLD HOUSES ROUND ABOUT SPEAK VERY PLAINLY OF THOSE DAYS WHEN KINGSTON WAS A ROYAL BOROUGH AND NOBLES AND COURTIERS LIVED THERE
AND TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN WILL BUY UP ALL THE PRESENTS FROM RAMSGATE AND SOUVENIRS OF MARGATE
AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT
WHAT'S THAT FOR WHAT'S THAT FOR WHY NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT HARRIS SAID I MAY HAVE BEEN TO BLAME I ADMIT IT
I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS HE DIDN'T PUT UP AT THE PUBLIC HOUSES
OR IF IT IS ONLY THE HALO OF AGE GLOWING AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR CHARMS IN OUR EYES THE OLD BLUE THAT WE HANG ABOUT OUR WALLS AS ORNAMENTS WERE THE COMMON EVERY DAY HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS OF A FEW CENTURIES AGO AND THE PINK SHEPHERDS AND THE YELLOW SHEPHERDESSES THAT WE
SO HE SLIPPED FROM THE NOISY REVEL TO STEAL A QUIET MOONLIGHT HOUR WITH HIS BELOVED
THOUGHTLESS FRIENDS JEER AT IT AND EVEN MY LANDLADY HERSELF
I NEVER KNEW SUCH A STRANGE CREATURE YET HARMLESS MIND YOU AS THE BABE UNBORN WELL THAT BOY
ABOUT TEN MINUTES MORE PASSED AND THEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE CENTRE HARRIS THOUGHT AT FIRST OF PRETENDING THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD BEEN AIMING AT BUT THE CROWD LOOKED DANGEROUS AND HE DECIDED TO TREAT IT AS AN ACCIDENT ANYHOW
I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF
THE PROPRIETOR WENT UP TO THE PAPER AND TAPPED IT IT GAVE FORTH A WOODEN SOUND OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE
WILL THE WHITE CUPS WITH THE GOLD RIM AND THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD FLOWER INSIDE SPECIES UNKNOWN THAT OUR SARAH JANES NOW BREAK IN SHEER LIGHT HEARTEDNESS OF SPIRIT BE CAREFULLY MENDED
THOSE GRAND OLD ARTISTS THAT FLOURISHED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND PRODUCED THOSE CHINA DOGS THE SAMPLER THAT THE ELDEST DAUGHTER DID AT SCHOOL WILL BE SPOKEN OF
SO IT IS WITH THAT CHINA DOG
YOUNG VINE PEEPING OVER THE TOP AT THIS SPOT TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON UPON THE BUSY RIVER AND THE SOBER OLD IVY CLUSTERING A LITTLE FARTHER DOWN THERE ARE FIFTY SHADES AND TINTS AND HUES IN EVERY TEN YARDS OF THAT OLD WALL IF I COULD ONLY DRAW
HE WOULD BE STRICKEN DOWN WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND HE WOULD GO OUT IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND COME HOME WITH A SUNSTROKE THEY PUT HIM UNDER LAUGHING GAS ONE YEAR POOR LAD AND DREW ALL HIS TEETH AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO
HAND ROUND NOW FOR ALL OUR FRIENDS TO GUSH OVER AND PRETEND THEY UNDERSTAND
WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE LOOKED QUITE PICTURESQUE IN THE FLASHING SUNLIGHT THE GLINTING RIVER WITH ITS DRIFTING BARGES THE WOODED TOWPATH THE TRIM KEPT VILLAS ON THE OTHER SIDE HARRIS IN A RED AND ORANGE BLAZER GRUNTING AWAY AT THE SCULLS
WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE STOPPED THERE AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS TO TAKE A WALK ROUND AND COME BACK TO THEM
I NEVER PASS IT WITHOUT FEELING BETTER FOR THE SIGHT OF IT SUCH A MELLOW BRIGHT SWEET OLD WALL
NOTHING WE COULD THINK OF SEEMED TO MAKE US ILL UNTIL THE HOLIDAYS BEGAN THEN ON THE BREAKING UP DAY WE CAUGHT COLDS AND WHOOPING COUGH AND ALL KINDS OF DISORDERS WHICH LASTED TILL THE TERM RECOMMENCED WHEN IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE COULD MANOEUVRE TO THE CONTRARY
OVER CARVED OAK WITH BLUE WALL PAPER
THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW AND SUGGESTED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO THE ENTRANCE AND BEGIN AGAIN
I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS AND FORGOT AS
SUPPOSING HARRIS SAY TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF AND BECAME A GREAT AND GOOD MAN AND GOT TO BE PRIME MINISTER AND DIED IF THEY WOULD PUT UP SIGNS OVER THE PUBLIC HOUSES THAT HE HAD PATRONISED HARRIS HAD A GLASS OF BITTER IN THIS HOUSE
WHEN THE DAINTY SHEEN OF GRASS AND LEAF IS BLUSHING TO A DEEPER GREEN AND THE YEAR SEEMS LIKE A FAIR YOUNG MAID TREMBLING WITH STRANGE WAKENING PULSES ON THE BRINK OF WOMANHOOD THE QUAINT BACK STREETS OF KINGSTON
OF THE VICTORIAN ERA AND BE ALMOST PRICELESS THE BLUE AND WHITE MUGS OF THE PRESENT DAY ROADSIDE INN WILL BE HUNTED UP ALL CRACKED AND CHIPPED AND SOLD FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD AND RICH PEOPLE WILL USE THEM FOR CLARET CUPS
SO THAT HE COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A BOY TO GET ILL AS THAT SANDFORD AND MERTON
THE MAKING OF SUCH DOGS WILL HAVE BECOME A LOST ART OUR DESCENDANTS WILL WONDER HOW WE DID IT AND SAY HOW CLEVER WE WERE WE SHALL BE REFERRED TO LOVINGLY AS
WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN
FROM THE STAIRS THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS A LARGE BRIGHT ROOM DECORATED WITH A SOMEWHAT STARTLING THOUGH CHEERFUL PAPER OF A BLUE GROUND THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER REMARKABLE ABOUT THE APARTMENT AND MY FRIEND WONDERED WHY HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE
NEAR THEIR KING AND THE LONG ROAD TO THE PALACE GATES WAS GAY ALL DAY WITH CLANKING STEEL AND PRANCING PALFREYS AND RUSTLING SILKS AND VELVETS AND FAIR FACES THE LARGE AND SPACIOUS HOUSES WITH THEIR
THAT IS WHY WE CROWD INTO THE TOWNS AND CITIES AND THE COUNTRY GROWS MORE AND MORE DESERTED EVERY YEAR IN THE SUNLIGHT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN NATURE IS ALIVE AND BUSY ALL AROUND US WE LIKE THE OPEN HILL SIDES AND THE DEEP WOODS WELL ENOUGH BUT IN THE NIGHT
THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE BACK IN THE CENTRE AGAIN AFTER THAT THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE
HE COULDN'T FIND THEM AND HE WANDERED ABOUT TRYING TO GET TO THEM AND THEN HE GOT LOST
I FORGET THAT I AM STEERING INTERESTING RESULT HAMPTON COURT MAZE HARRIS AS A GUIDE IT WAS A GLORIOUS MORNING LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER AS YOU CARE TO TAKE IT
IT IS A WHITE DOG ITS EYES BLUE ITS NOSE IS A DELICATE RED WITH SPOTS ITS HEAD IS PAINFULLY ERECT ITS EXPRESSION IS AMIABILITY CARRIED
FOR SITTING UP IN BED AND READING GREEK AND AS FOR FRENCH IRREGULAR VERBS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM THEM
HE HAD TO STOP IN BED WHEN HE WAS ILL AND EAT CHICKEN AND CUSTARDS AND HOT HOUSE GRAPES AND HE WOULD LIE THERE AND SOB BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM DO LATIN EXERCISES
THEY PICKED UP VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET IT OVER
THEY NEVER MEAN TO MARRY IT DOES NOT DO TO DWELL ON THESE THINGS IT MAKES ONE SO SAD THERE WAS A BOY AT OUR SCHOOL WE USED TO CALL HIM SANDFORD AND MERTON HIS REAL NAME WAS STIVVINGS
ORIEL LATTICED WINDOWS THEIR HUGE FIREPLACES AND THEIR GABLED ROOFS BREATHE OF THE DAYS OF HOSE AND DOUBLET OF PEARL EMBROIDERED STOMACHERS AND COMPLICATED OATHS THEY WERE UPRAISED IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KNEW HOW TO BUILD
I CAN'T SAY I ALTOGETHER BLAME THE MAN WHICH IS DOUBTLESS A GREAT RELIEF TO HIS MIND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW WHICH WOULD BE THAT OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLDER DESIRING TO TAKE LIFE AS LIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT THAT OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP MANIAC
THE HARD RED BRICKS HAVE ONLY GROWN MORE FIRMLY SET WITH TIME AND THEIR OAK STAIRS DO NOT CREAK AND GRUNT WHEN YOU TRY TO GO DOWN THEM QUIETLY SPEAKING OF OAK STAIRCASES REMINDS ME THAT THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT CARVED OAK STAIRCASE IN ONE OF THE HOUSES IN KINGSTON
WAS ENGLAND'S VIRGIN QUEEN THERE'S SCARCELY A PUB OF ANY ATTRACTIONS WITHIN TEN MILES OF LONDON THAT SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE LOOKED IN AT OR STOPPED AT OR SLEPT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER I WONDER NOW
AND THE WALL ALL THE WAY UP WAS OAK PANELLED WITH CARVING
ASKED OUR HERO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME FINE OLD CARVED OAK MY FRIEND SAID HE WOULD AND THE SHOPMAN THEREUPON TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SHOP AND UP THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE
AS SHE HERSELF HAD TAKEN IT FROM THE CHILD AND THROWN IT DOWN THERE JUST BEFORE SHE MET HARRIS SHE ALSO ADDED THAT SHE WISHED SHE NEVER HAD MET HARRIS AND EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR THAT MADE HARRIS MAD AND HE PRODUCED HIS MAP AND EXPLAINED HIS THEORY
BUT HE HELD ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY PASSED THE HALF OF A PENNY BUN ON THE GROUND THAT HARRIS'S COUSIN SWORE HE HAD NOTICED THERE SEVEN MINUTES AGO HARRIS SAID OH IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE WOMAN WITH THE BABY SAID NOT AT ALL
WHO HAD BEEN THERE ALL THE MORNING INSISTED ON TAKING HIS ARM FOR FEAR OF LOSING HIM HARRIS KEPT ON TURNING TO THE RIGHT BUT IT SEEMED A LONG WAY
OH ONE OF THE LARGEST IN EUROPE SAID HARRIS YES IT MUST BE REPLIED THE COUSIN BECAUSE WE'VE WALKED A GOOD TWO MILES ALREADY HARRIS BEGAN TO THINK IT RATHER STRANGE HIMSELF
THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HE HAD BECOME UNPOPULAR THEY ALL GOT CRAZY AT LAST AND SANG OUT FOR THE KEEPER AND THE MAN CAME AND CLIMBED UP THE LADDER OUTSIDE AND SHOUTED OUT DIRECTIONS TO THEM BUT ALL THEIR HEADS WERE BY THIS TIME IN SUCH A CONFUSED WHIRL
HARRIS HOWEVER SAID HE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR A BIT AND PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD TAKE A TURN SO AS WE WERE IN I GOT OUT AND TOOK THE TOW LINE AND RAN THE BOAT ON PAST HAMPTON COURT WHAT A DEAR OLD WALL THAT IS THAT RUNS ALONG BY THE RIVER THERE
WHEN THE DARK TREES RUSTLE IN THE NIGHT WIND
HARRIS HAD TWO OF SCOTCH COLD HERE IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTY EIGHT HARRIS WAS CHUCKED FROM HERE IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX NO THERE WOULD BE TOO MANY OF THEM IT WOULD BE THE HOUSES THAT HE HAD NEVER ENTERED THAT WOULD BECOME FAMOUS
CHAPTER SIX KINGSTON INSTRUCTIVE REMARKS ON EARLY ENGLISH HISTORY INSTRUCTIVE OBSERVATIONS ON CARVED OAK AND LIFE IN GENERAL SAD CASE OF STIVVINGS JUNIOR MUSINGS ON ANTIQUITY
GREAT CAESAR CROSSED THE RIVER THERE AND THE ROMAN LEGIONS CAMPED UPON ITS SLOPING UPLANDS CAESAR LIKE IN LATER YEARS ELIZABETH
THERE IS REASON ON HIS SIDE CARVED OAK IS VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AND TO HAVE A LITTLE OF BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING TO LIVE IN FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO
THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE GREY OLD PALACE OF THE TUDORS ALL MADE A SUNNY PICTURE SO BRIGHT BUT CALM SO FULL OF LIFE
HE WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LAD I EVER CAME ACROSS
HE WENT IN ONCE TO SHOW SOMEBODY ELSE THE WAY
CHARGED FOR ADMISSION HARRIS
BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS TIME IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THAT DOG WILL BE DUG UP FROM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER MINUS ITS LEGS AND WITH ITS TAIL BROKEN AND WILL BE SOLD FOR OLD CHINA
WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AND HAD HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF IT HARRIS TOLD THEM THEY COULD FOLLOW HIM IF THEY LIKED HE WAS JUST GOING IN AND THEN SHOULD TURN ROUND AND COME OUT AGAIN THEY SAID IT WAS VERY KIND OF HIM AND FELL BEHIND AND FOLLOWED
IT SEEMS TO BE THE RULE OF THIS WORLD EACH PERSON HAS WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WHAT HE DOES WANT MARRIED MEN HAVE WIVES AND DON'T SEEM TO WANT THEM AND YOUNG SINGLE FELLOWS CRY OUT THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEM
RICH OLD COUPLES WITH NO ONE TO LEAVE THEIR MONEY TO DIE CHILDLESS THEN THERE ARE GIRLS WITH LOVERS THE GIRLS THAT HAVE LOVERS NEVER WANT THEM THEY SAY THEY WOULD RATHER BE WITHOUT THEM THAT THEY BOTHER THEM
FOR THE BEGINNING AGAIN PART OF IT THERE WAS NOT MUCH ENTHUSIASM BUT WITH REGARD TO THE ADVISABILITY OF GOING BACK TO THE ENTRANCE THERE WAS COMPLETE UNANIMITY AND SO THEY TURNED AND TRAILED AFTER HARRIS AGAIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
PALERMO AND THE WHOLE KINGDOM THE PEARLS AND JEWELS HOWEVER PRECIOUS MIGHT BE EASILY REMOVED BUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HORSES
BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
IN THE IMPERIAL PURPLE INCESSANTLY SURROUNDED WITH A TRAIN OF FLATTERERS THEY PASSED THEIR YOUTH IN THE ENJOYMENT OF LUXURY AND THE EXPECTATION OF A THRONE
LORD MURRAY THE MARQUESS'S ELDEST SON WHO WAS MARRIED TO A DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF HAMILTON DECLARED FOR KING WILLIAM STEWART OF BALLENACH THE MARQUESS'S CONFIDENTIAL AGENT
IT WAS DEEMED THE MOST PERILOUS OF ALL THOSE DARK RAVINES THROUGH WHICH THE MARAUDERS OF THE HILLS WERE WONT TO SALLY FORTH THE SOUND SO MUSICAL TO MODERN EARS
A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT WESTMINSTER WAS A SERIOUS THING AND LEFT THE SOVEREIGN NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO YIELD OR TO RAISE MONEY BY UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS BUT A REFUSAL OF SUPPLIES AT EDINBURGH
TO RECOVER THE PROVINCES OF ITALY AND SICILY AND TO CHASTISE THIS PRETENDED KING
CUT INTO THIN AND POLISHED SLICES CAREFULLY LAID OVER EACH OTHER IN THE MANNER OF SCALES OR FEATHERS
MEN WEARING THE SAME TARTAN AND ATTACHED TO THE SAME LORD WERE ARRAYED AGAINST EACH OTHER THE NAME OF THE ABSENT CHIEF WAS USED WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON ON BOTH SIDES BALLENACH AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF VASSALS
REDUCED HIM TO NO SUCH DILEMMA THE LARGEST SUM THAT HE COULD HOPE TO RECEIVE FROM SCOTLAND IN A YEAR WAS LESS THAN WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND EVERY FORTNIGHT
WERE STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE CONTENDING BARBARIANS AFTER SOME EXPERIENCE OF THE SUPERIOR STRENGTH AND NUMBERS OF THEIR ADVERSARIES THE SARMATIANS IMPLORED THE PROTECTION OF THE ROMAN MONARCH WHO BEHELD WITH PLEASURE THE DISCORD OF THE NATIONS
WHITE VILLAS PEEP FROM THE BIRCH FOREST AND ON A FINE SUMMER DAY THERE IS SCARCELY A TURN OF THE PASS AT WHICH MAY NOT BE SEEN SOME ANGLER CASTING HIS FLY ON THE FOAM OF THE RIVER SOME ARTIST SKETCHING A PINNACLE OF ROCK
AND HENRY PURSUED HIS VICTORIOUS MARCH FROM CAPUA TO PALERMO THE POLITICAL BALANCE OF ITALY WAS DESTROYED BY HIS SUCCESS AND IF THE POPE AND THE FREE CITIES HAD CONSULTED THEIR OBVIOUS AND REAL INTEREST
OR SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE BANQUETING ON THE TURF IN THE FRETWORK OF SHADE AND SUNSHINE BUT IN THE DAYS OF WILLIAM THE THIRD KILLIECRANKIE WAS MENTIONED WITH HORROR BY THE PEACEFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE PERTHSHIRE LOWLANDS
THE ANCIENT PATRIMONY OF THEIR FATHER FOR THE MORE OPULENT BUT LESS MARTIAL COUNTRIES OF THE EAST ITALY
DECLARED FOR KING JAMES THE PEOPLE KNEW NOT WHICH SUMMONS TO OBEY HE WHOSE AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD IN PROFOUND REVERENCE HAD PLIGHTED FAITH TO BOTH SIDES
HAD INFORMED HIS SOVEREIGN THAT HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO QUELL ANY DOMESTIC REVOLT OF APULIA AND CALABRIA BUT THAT HIS FORCES WERE INADEQUATE TO RESIST THE IMPENDING ATTACK OF THE KING OF SICILY
FROM THE BUSINESS OF PERSECUTING THE DALRYMPLE FAMILY TO THE IMPORTANT AND PRESSING QUESTION OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT THEY SAID THAT THE OLD SYSTEM HAD BEEN ABOLISHED THAT NO OTHER SYSTEM HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED
AND A MASTER OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WEAPONS USED IN THE SERVICE EITHER OF THE CAVALRY
AND THE DATES OF THEIR PROMOTION MAY BE REFERRED TO THE TENTH THE TWENTIETH
AND THE MOST INTREPID PATRIOTS THE MOST FAITHFUL SERVANTS
WITH A FORMIDABLE BODY OF CAVALRY
BUT WHO WAS JUSTLY ALARMED BY THE PROGRESS OF THE GOTHIC ARMS AS SOON AS CONSTANTINE HAD DECLARED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF THE WEAKER PARTY THE HAUGHTY ARARIC KING OF THE GOTHS INSTEAD OF EXPECTING THE ATTACK OF THE LEGIONS
FOR THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY HIM ONLY FOUR YEARS BEFORE AS THE MINISTERS OF HIS VENGEANCE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ARGYLE THEY HAD GARRISONED INVERARY THEY HAD RAVAGED LORN THEY HAD DEMOLISHED HOUSES CUT DOWN FRUIT TREES
THE SERVICE OF A NORMAN ARMY AND THE TRUCE OF THIRTY YEARS WAS NOT DISTURBED BY ANY HOSTILITIES BETWEEN SICILY AND CONSTANTINOPLE ABOUT THE END OF THAT PERIOD
THE POPE TWICE RECEIVED IN THE VATICAN THE AMBASSADORS OF CONSTANTINOPLE THEY FLATTERED HIS PIETY BY THE LONG PROMISED UNION OF THE TWO CHURCHES
WITH THE FIGURE AND COMPLEXION OF THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF EUROPE ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS ACCIDENTS OF PEACE AND WAR OF ALLIANCE OR CONQUEST
THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF EMPLOYING FISH BONES FOR THE POINTS OF THEIR WEAPONS
SO MUCH PROVOKED BY THEIR PERVERSENESS THAT AFTER LONG TEMPORISING HE REFUSED TO TOUCH EVEN ACTS WHICH WERE IN THEMSELVES UNOBJECTIONABLE AND TO WHICH HIS INSTRUCTIONS EMPOWERED HIM TO CONSENT
WOULD HAVE SENT TWO THOUSAND CLAYMORES TO THE JACOBITE SIDE BUT THAT WORD HE WOULD NOT SPEAK AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAS AS IRRESOLUTE AND INCONSISTENT AS HIS OWN
THEY ARE STRONGLY DISCRIMINATED BY THE EPITHETS OF THE BAD AND THE GOOD BUT THESE EPITHETS WHICH APPEAR TO DESCRIBE THE PERFECTION OF VICE AND VIRTUE CANNOT STRICTLY BE APPLIED TO EITHER OF THE NORMAN PRINCES
THE LIMITS OF THEIR AUTHORITY WERE INSENSIBLY ENLARGED
AND THE HEIRESS OF THE NORMAN LINE MIGHT STRUGGLE TO CHECK HER DESPOTIC HUSBAND AND TO SAVE THE PATRIMONY OF HER NEW BORN SON OF AN EMPEROR SO FAMOUS IN THE NEXT AGE UNDER THE NAME OF FREDERIC THE SECOND TEN YEARS AFTER THIS REVOLUTION
WITHOUT HEALING THE DISCONTENT OF HIS SUBJECTS THE FEUDAL GOVERNMENT WAS ALWAYS PREGNANT WITH THE SEEDS OF REBELLION AND A NEPHEW OF ROGER HIMSELF INVITED THE ENEMIES OF HIS FAMILY AND NATION THE MAJESTY OF THE PURPLE
AND HENRY THE SIXTH THE SON OF FREDERIC BARBAROSSA DESCENDED FROM THE ALPS TO CLAIM THE IMPERIAL CROWN AND THE INHERITANCE OF HIS WIFE AGAINST THE UNANIMOUS WISH OF A FREE PEOPLE
WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF RESISTING A SWORD OR JAVELIN
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHARACTER OF CONSTANTINE AND HIS SONS PART TWO
WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR SOME INDICATION OF HIS WISHES THEY WERE CALLED TO ARMS AT ONCE BY TWO LEADERS EITHER OF WHOM MIGHT WITH SOME SHOW OF REASON CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ABSENT CHIEF
WHO CONSIDERED HIM AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MARQUESS OCCUPIED BLAIR CASTLE MURRAY WITH TWELVE HUNDRED FOLLOWERS APPEARED BEFORE THE WALLS AND DEMANDED TO BE ADMITTED
AND IN EVERY OPERATION GOLD AS WELL AS STEEL WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF VICTORY SALERNO AND SOME PLACES ALONG THE WESTERN COAST MAINTAINED THEIR FIDELITY TO THE NORMAN KING
THE PURSUIT OF GAME AND THE EXERCISES OF WAR OR RATHER OF RAPINE DIRECTED THE VAGRANT MOTIONS OF THE SARMATIANS THE MOVABLE CAMPS OR CITIES THE ORDINARY RESIDENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
WITHOUT INJURY OR RANSOM MAY APPEAR TO SURPASS THE MOST LIBERAL MEASURE OF POLICY OR REASON AFTER HIS DECEASE THE KINGDOM OF HIS WIDOW AND INFANT SON FELL WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
HE HAD LEARNED TO COMMAND HIS OWN PASSIONS TO ENCOUNTER THOSE OF HIS EQUALS AND TO DEPEND FOR HIS PRESENT SAFETY AND FUTURE GREATNESS ON THE PRUDENCE AND FIRMNESS OF HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT HIS DESTINED SUCCESSORS
MIGHT BE EXCUSED BY THE PARTIALITY OF PATERNAL AFFECTION BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVES OF THE EMPEROR WHEN HE ENDANGERED THE SAFETY BOTH OF HIS FAMILY AND OF HIS PEOPLE BY THE UNNECESSARY ELEVATION
THE FRENCH MONARCHS ANNEXED TO THEIR CROWN THE DUCHY OF NORMANDY THE SCEPTRE OF HER ANCIENT DUKES HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED BY A GRANDDAUGHTER OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR TO THE HOUSE OF PLANTAGENET AND THE ADVENTUROUS NORMANS
FROM OTHER COUNTRY SEATS OF THE ARISTOCRACY THE OLD BUILDING WAS A LOFTY TOWER OF RUDE ARCHITECTURE
THIS INHERITANCE COULD ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY ARMS AND I AM PLEASED TO TRANSCRIBE THE STYLE AND SENSE OF THE HISTORIAN FALCANDUS WHO WRITES AT THE MOMENT AND ON THE SPOT WITH THE FEELINGS OF A PATRIOT
HE HAD THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING HIS TROOPS FLY BEFORE AN INCONSIDERABLE DETACHMENT
CONSISTED ONLY OF LARGE WAGONS DRAWN BY OXEN AND COVERED IN THE FORM OF TENTS THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NATION WAS COMPOSED OF CAVALRY AND THE CUSTOM OF THEIR WARRIORS TO LEAD IN THEIR HAND ONE OR TWO SPARE HORSES
THE GOTHIC KINGS ASPIRED TO EXTEND THEIR DOMINION FROM THE EUXINE TO THE FRONTIERS OF GERMANY
THEY WATCHED OR SUSPENDED THE MOMENT OF ATTACK AS THEY WERE PROVOKED BY INJURIES OR APPEASED BY PRESENTS THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED THE SKILL OF USING MORE DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND ALTHOUGH THE SARMATIANS DID NOT ILLUSTRATE THEIR NAME BY ANY MEMORABLE EXPLOITS
ALIKE EMINENT IN RANK ALIKE DEFECTIVE IN MILITARY TALENTS THE GREEKS WERE OPPRESSED BY LAND AND SEA
AND THE DREAD OF FUTURITY THE LEGITIMATE MALE POSTERITY OF TANCRED OF HAUTEVILLE WAS EXTINCT IN THE PERSON OF THE SECOND WILLIAM BUT HIS AUNT THE DAUGHTER OF ROGER HAD MARRIED THE MOST POWERFUL PRINCE OF THE AGE
BUT HE LOST IN TWO CAMPAIGNS THE GREATER PART OF HIS CONTINENTAL POSSESSIONS AND THE MODEST EMPEROR DISDAINING ALL FLATTERY AND FALSEHOOD WAS CONTENT WITH THE REDUCTION OF THREE HUNDRED CITIES OR VILLAGES OF APULIA AND CALABRIA
SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF THE LATTER WERE SLAIN BUT THEIR SURVIVING BRETHREN FORTIFIED THE MOUNTAINS AND DISTURBED ABOVE THIRTY YEARS THE PEACE OF THE ISLAND BY THE POLICY OF FREDERIC THE SECOND SIXTY THOUSAND SARACENS WERE TRANSPLANTED
TIBISCUS TO RETIRE INTO THE HILLY COUNTRY AND TO ABANDON TO THE VICTORIOUS SARMATIANS THE FERTILE PLAINS OF THE UPPER HUNGARY
THAT POISONED THE WOUNDS WHICH THEY INFLICTED IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE MOST SAVAGE MANNERS SINCE A PEOPLE IMPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF HUMANITY WOULD HAVE ABHORRED SO CRUEL A PRACTICE AND A NATION SKILLED IN THE ARTS OF WAR
AND HAD THEN RUN AWAY FOR FEAR OF BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF JOINING EITHER NOR WAS IT VERY EASY TO SAY
BUT THE CALL WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND THE TIME ALLOWED WAS SO SHORT THAT THE MUSTER WAS NOT A VERY FULL ONE THE WHOLE NUMBER OF BROADSWORDS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNDER THREE THOUSAND
BY AN INHUMAN TYRANT WHO HAD DESERVED THE ABHORRENCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND MANKIND THE SWORD OF WILLIAM THE SECOND THE GRANDSON OF ROGER WAS DRAWN BY A FUGITIVE OF THE COMNENIAN RACE
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT THE FIRST DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT AN END TO AN ANARCHY WHICH WAS DAILY PRODUCING DISASTERS AND CRIMES
DEPARTED LONG SINCE TO ENRICH THE BARBARIANS WITH OUR TREASURES AND NOW RETURNS WITH HER SAVAGE ALLIES TO CONTAMINATE
SUGGESTED TO OUR ANCESTORS THOUGHTS OF MURDEROUS AMBUSCADES AND OF BODIES STRIPPED GASHED AND ABANDONED TO THE BIRDS OF PREY
OF KILLIECRANKIE AT PRESENT A HIGHWAY AS SMOOTH AS ANY ROAD IN MIDDLESEX
LED DIRECTLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE KING OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THE APPOINTMENT OF ANY GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARY SIR PATRICK INDEED AVOWED BOTH IN SPEECH AND IN WRITING HIS OPINION THAT THE WHOLE PATRONAGE OF THE REALM
AND FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF HISTORY THERE IS SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SARMATIANS WERE THE JAZYGAE ONE OF THE MOST NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE TRIBES OF THE NATION THE ALLUREMENTS OF PLENTY ENGAGED THEM
AND A SERIES OF HUNGARIAN AND TURKISH WARS
AND THE PROVINCES OF PONTUS CAPPADOCIA
PROBABLY MADE UP THE ARMY TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE THREE THOUSAND MEN
TO SEEK A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE SOON AFTER THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS THEY OBLIGED THE DACIANS
HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND THE NOBLES OF BOTH SEXES WERE SEPARATELY CONFINED IN THE FORTRESSES OF THE ALPS AND ON THE SLIGHTEST RUMOR OF REBELLION THE CAPTIVES WERE DEPRIVED OF LIFE OF THEIR EYES OR OF THE HOPE OF POSTERITY
WERE DESTINED TO FORM THE EXTENT OF HIS NEW KINGDOM FOR EACH OF THESE PRINCES A SUITABLE ESTABLISHMENT WAS PROVIDED A JUST PROPORTION OF GUARDS OF LEGIONS AND OF AUXILIARIES WAS ALLOTTED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIGNITY AND DEFENCE
AND THE DUTIES OF ACTIVE LIFE THOSE WHO OCCASIONALLY MENTION THE EDUCATION OR TALENTS OF CONSTANTIUS ALLOW THAT HE EXCELLED IN THE GYMNASTIC ARTS OF LEAPING AND RUNNING THAT HE WAS A DEXTEROUS ARCHER A SKILFUL HORSEMAN
CAN UNITE FOR THEIR COMMON SAFETY
AND WERE IN STRENGTH AND COURAGE INFERIOR TO NO TRIBE IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT THE CLAN HAD BEEN MADE INSIGNIFICANT BY THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHIEF THE MARQUESS WAS THE FALSEST THE MOST FICKLE
THE MINISTERS AND GENERALS WHO WERE PLACED ABOUT THEIR PERSONS WERE SUCH AS CONSTANTINE COULD TRUST TO ASSIST AND EVEN TO CONTROL THESE YOUTHFUL SOVEREIGNS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR DELEGATED POWER AS THEY ADVANCED IN YEARS AND EXPERIENCE
AND AFRICA WERE ACCUSTOMED TO REVERE CONSTANS THE THIRD OF HIS SONS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GREAT CONSTANTINE HE FIXED DALMATIUS ON THE GOTHIC FRONTIER TO WHICH HE ANNEXED THE GOVERNMENT OF THRACE MACEDONIA AND GREECE
BUT THE GENIUS OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF HAD BEEN FORMED BY ADVERSITY AND EXPERIENCE
AND THE SUBJECTS OF ANDRONICUS MIGHT SALUTE THE STRANGERS AS FRIENDS
EXASPERATED A FREE AND COMMERCIAL PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED GALLEYS WERE LAUNCHED AND ARMED IN AS MANY DAYS THEY SWEPT THE COASTS OF DALMATIA AND GREECE BUT AFTER SOME MUTUAL WOUNDS THE WAR WAS TERMINATED BY AN AGREEMENT
THE GREEK MONARCH INTRUSTED A FLEET AND ARMY
BY ABDICATING THE FUNCTIONS BOTH OF A PEER AND OF A CHIEFTAIN BY ABSENTING HIMSELF BOTH FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AT EDINBURGH AND FROM HIS CASTLE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND BY QUITTING THE COUNTRY TO WHICH HE WAS BOUND BY EVERY TIE OF DUTY AND HONOUR
RENDERED IT AN IMPORTANT GARRISON IN THE HEART OF ITALY IT WAS TWICE BESIEGED BY THE ARMS OF FREDERIC THE IMPERIAL FORCES WERE TWICE REPULSED BY THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM THAT SPIRIT WAS ANIMATED BY THE AMBASSADOR OF CONSTANTINOPLE
AND THE PROPHETIC EYE OF A STATESMAN CONSTANTIA THE DAUGHTER OF SICILY NURSED FROM HER CRADLE IN THE PLEASURES AND PLENTY AND EDUCATED IN THE ARTS AND MANNERS OF THIS FORTUNATE ISLE
THE UNJUST AND ABSURD ACT OF INCAPACITATION WAS CARRIED BY SEVENTY FOUR VOICES TO TWENTY FOUR ANOTHER VOTE STILL MORE OBVIOUSLY AIMED AT THE HOUSE OF STAIR SPEEDILY FOLLOWED
AND ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO ASSEMBLE IN THE LOW COUNTRY OF PERTHSHIRE SOME OF THEM WERE QUARTERED AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THEY DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME
INCOMPETENT AS HE WAS HE BORE A COMMISSION WHICH GAVE HIM MILITARY RANK IN SCOTLAND NEXT TO DUNDEE
ONE OF THEM WAS COMMANDED BY LORD KENMORE THE OTHER WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE BORDER AND WHICH IS STILL STYLED THE KING'S OWN BORDERERS BY LORD LEVEN TWO TROOPS OF HORSE LORD ANNANDALE'S AND LORD BELHAVEN'S
THE INHERITANCE OF THE EMPIRE SEEMED TO DEVOLVE ON THE THREE SONS OF FAUSTA WHO HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED UNDER THE NAMES OF CONSTANTINE OF CONSTANTIUS AND OF CONSTANS THESE YOUNG PRINCES WERE SUCCESSIVELY INVESTED WITH THE TITLE OF CAESAR
WHOSE NAMES AND TITLES WERE INSCRIBED ON ALL THE WALLS OF THE PALACE THE PREJUDICES OF THE LATINS
THE TERM OF HIS LIFE AND REIGN HE STOOD IN ARMS ON THE FARTHEST VERGE OF THE APULIAN FRONTIER AGAINST THE POWERS OF GERMANY AND THE RESTITUTION OF A ROYAL CAPTIVE
HIS AMBITION WAS EXCITED BY THE HOPE OF STRIPPING THE PURPLE FROM THE GERMAN USURPERS AND OF ESTABLISHING IN THE WEST AS IN THE EAST HIS LAWFUL TITLE OF SOLE EMPEROR OF THE ROMANS
THEIR SHAGGY BEARDS UNCOMBED LOCKS
THE PARLIAMENT LAID CLAIM TO A VETO ON THE NOMINATION OF THE JUDGES AND ASSUMED THE POWER OF STOPPING THE SIGNET IN OTHER WORDS OF SUSPENDING THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TILL THIS CLAIM SHOULD BE ALLOWED
MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN WILLIAM DURING THIS SESSION FOUND THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH TO PUT ON WILLIAM SUCH A PRESSURE AS THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER HAD PUT ON CHARLES
INGLORIOUS TO THE EMPIRE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE REPUBLIC AND A COMPLETE VENGEANCE OF THESE AND OF FRESH INJURIES WAS RESERVED FOR THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION
ENABLED THEM TO ADVANCE AND TO RETREAT WITH A RAPID DILIGENCE WHICH SURPRISED THE SECURITY AND ELUDED THE PURSUIT
THAT THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS COULD BE MOST EFFECTUALLY SUBDUED WERE THE PICKAXE AND THE SPADE THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY JUST ABOVE THIS PASS WAS NOW THE THEATRE OF A WAR SUCH AS THE HIGHLANDS HAD NOT OFTEN WITNESSED
WHICH RESPECT FOR HIS IMMENSE POWER PREVENTED THEM FROM FULLY EXPRESSING AFTER REPEATEDLY VOWING FIDELITY TO BOTH PARTIES AND REPEATEDLY BETRAYING BOTH HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BEST PROVIDE FOR HIS SAFETY
THE MOST PUSILLANIMOUS OF MANKIND ALREADY IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIX MONTHS HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES A JACOBITE AND SEVERAL TIMES A WILLIAMITE BOTH JACOBITES AND WILLIAMITES REGARDED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND DISTRUST
IN ANY AGE OF THE EMPIRE HANNIBALIANUS ALONE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THE TITLE OF KING
IN THEIR WARS AGAINST THE ROMAN CHURCH THE EMPEROR AND HIS SON MAINFROY
MORE DILIGENTLY CULTIVATED AND MORE THICKLY PEOPLED THAN THE GREATER PART OF THE HIGHLANDS THE MEN WHO FOLLOWED HIS BANNER WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NOT LESS NUMEROUS THAN ALL THE MACDONALDS AND MACLEANS UNITED
WHERE HE WAS EXPOSED ALMOST WITHOUT DEFENCE TO THE FURY OF THESE MONSTERS OF THE DESERT
AND HE POURED SAYS THE HISTORIAN A RIVER OF GOLD INTO THE BOSOM OF ANCONA WHOSE ATTACHMENT TO THE GREEKS
OF HIS TWO NEPHEWS DALMATIUS AND HANNIBALIANUS THE FORMER WAS RAISED BY THE TITLE OF CAESAR TO AN EQUALITY WITH HIS COUSINS IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER CONSTANTINE INVENTED THE NEW AND SINGULAR APPELLATION
THE USE OF SUCH A TITLE
THIS STATE OF THINGS WOULD HAVE ENDED IN SOME GREAT CONVULSION IF THE KING OF SCOTLAND HAD NOT BEEN ALSO KING OF A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OPULENT KINGDOM CHARLES THE FIRST HAD NEVER FOUND ANY PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER
WHICH HAD SERVED IN HOLLAND AND WHICH BORE THE NAMES OF THEIR COLONELS MACKAY HIMSELF BALFOUR AND RAMSAY THERE WAS ALSO A GALLANT REGIMENT OF INFANTRY FROM ENGLAND THEN CALLED HASTINGS'S BUT NOW KNOWN AS THE THIRTEENTH OF THE LINE
AND ISAAC ANGELUS THE NEW EMPEROR MIGHT INDULGE HIS VANITY OR VENGEANCE IN THE TREATMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND CAPTIVES
IT WAS PLAIN FROM WHAT PASSED IN DEBATE THAT THOUGH THE CHIEFS OF THE CLUB HAD BEGUN WITH THE COURT OF SESSION THEY DID NOT MEAN TO END THERE THE ARGUMENTS USED BY SIR PATRICK HUME AND OTHERS
BURNED FISHING BOATS BROKEN MILLSTONES HANGED CAMPBELLS AND WERE THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO BE PLEASED BY THE PROSPECT OF MAC CALLUM MORES RESTORATION ONE WORD FROM THE MARQUESS
THE FIRST WILLIAM DID NOT DEGENERATE FROM THE VALOR OF HIS RACE BUT HIS TEMPER WAS SLOTHFUL HIS MANNERS WERE DISSOLUTE HIS PASSIONS HEADSTRONG AND MISCHIEVOUS AND THE MONARCH IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR HIS PERSONAL VICES
WITH THIS FORCE SUCH AS IT WAS DUNDEE SET FORTH ON HIS MARCH HE WAS JOINED BY SUCCOURS WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED FROM ULSTER THEY CONSISTED OF LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED IRISH FOOT
THE LEADERS OF THE CLUB WERE NOT TO BE SO DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR OBJECT IT WAS MOVED AND RESOLVED THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS SHOULD BE POSTPONED TILL SECULAR AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SETTLED
THEY WOULD HAVE COMBINED THE POWERS OF EARTH AND HEAVEN TO PREVENT THE DANGEROUS UNION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE
APPEAR TO WEAR A SMOOTH AND UNIFORM ASPECT THE INDULGENCE OF CONSTANTINE ADMITTED THEM AT A VERY TENDER AGE TO SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EMPIRE AND THEY STUDIED THE ART OF REIGNING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLE INTRUSTED TO THEIR CARE
OF THE RIVER BRAWLING ROUND THE MOSSY ROCKS AND AMONG THE SMOOTH PEBBLES THE DARK MASSES OF CRAG AND VERDURE WORTHY OF THE PENCIL OF WILSON THE FANTASTIC PEAKS BATHED AT SUNRISE AND SUNSET
WHICH AFFLICTED PALERMO THE ISLAND AND THE CONTINENT DURING THE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE FIRST
THE WALLS WOULD HAVE OFFERED VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO A BATTERING TRAIN BUT WERE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE HERDSMEN OF THE GRAMPIANS IN AWE ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THIS STRONGHOLD
AND OF THE ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WERE INVITED BY THE LIBERALITY OF THE EMPEROR WHO RESERVED FOR HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT TASK OF INSTRUCTING THE ROYAL YOUTHS IN THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANKIND
OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CROWN TO THE ESTATES WHEN THE PLACE OF TREASURER
WITH THIS VIEW HE SOLICITED THE ALLIANCE OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BISHOP OF ROME SEVERAL OF THE NOBLES EMBRACED THE CAUSE OF THE GREEK MONARCH THE SPLENDID NUPTIALS OF HIS NIECE WITH ODO FRANGIPANI
WHICH HAD BEEN INEXORABLY PROSCRIBED BY THE LATIN CLERGY AFTER THE LOSS OF HER DUKES APULIA WAS CHAINED AS A SERVILE APPENDAGE TO THE CROWN OF SICILY THE FOUNDER OF THE MONARCHY HAD RULED BY THE SWORD
THAT THE CRISIS REQUIRED PROMPT AND STRENUOUS EXERTION ON THE FATE OF BLAIR CASTLE PROBABLY DEPENDED THE FATE OF ALL ATHOL ON THE FATE OF ATHOL MIGHT DEPEND THE FATE OF SCOTLAND MACKAY HASTENED NORTHWARD
THE GREAT ADMIRAL WHO ABUSED THE CONFIDENCE AND CONSPIRED AGAINST THE LIFE OF HIS BENEFACTOR FROM THE ARABIAN CONQUEST SICILY HAD IMBIBED A DEEP TINCTURE OF ORIENTAL MANNERS THE DESPOTISM THE POMP
AGAINST THE DESPOTISM OF FREDERIC BARBAROSSA
THOUGH NOT PERHAPS WITH EQUAL SUCCESS
BOLDLY PASSED THE DANUBE AND SPREAD TERROR AND DEVASTATION THROUGH THE PROVINCE OF MAESIA TO OPPOSE THE INROAD OF THIS DESTROYING HOST THE AGED EMPEROR TOOK THE FIELD IN PERSON
CLAIMED THE INDEFEASIBLE DOMINION OF ITALY AND PROFESSED HIS DESIGN OF CHASING THE BARBARIANS BEYOND THE ALPS BY THE ARTFUL SPEECHES LIBERAL GIFTS AND UNBOUNDED PROMISES OF THEIR EASTERN ALLY
WHO YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE GOTHIC POWER THEY SEEM TO HAVE CHOSEN A KING FROM THAT NATION
WAS TO ABOLISH THE PRIVILEGES AND TO SEIZE THE PROPERTY OF THESE IMPRUDENT ALLIES THE LAST HOPE OF FALCANDUS WAS DEFEATED BY THE DISCORD OF THE CHRISTIANS AND MAHOMETANS THEY FOUGHT IN THE CAPITAL
AND THEREFORE AS A VERY PROPER CLIMAX TO THE GREAT AWAKENING WHICH HAD RECENTLY ROUSED NEW ENGLAND TO THE HEIGHTS OF RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FAMOUS GEORGE WHITEFIELD HIMSELF
WILLIAM VAUGHAN URGED GOVERNOR SHIRLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE COUNTER ATTACK SHIRLEY WAS AN ENGLISH LAWYER GOOD AT HIS OWN WORK BUT VERY ANXIOUS TO BECOME FAMOUS AS A CONQUEROR HE LENT A WILLING EAR TO VAUGHAN
SUSPECTING A RUSE HE BRIBED AN INDIAN WITH A FLASK OF BRANDY TO FEIGN BEING DRUNK AND REEL UP TO THE WALLS THE INDIAN REACHED THE FORT UNCHALLENGED CLIMBED INTO AN EMBRASURE AND FOUND THE WHOLE PLACE DESERTED
AND MARCH ON LOUISBOURG IN FOUR DETACHMENTS WHILE THE GARRISON WAS WRAPPED IN SLUMBER TWO OF THESE DETACHMENTS WERE TO MARCH WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE AND THEN HALT AND KEEP A PROFOUND SILENCE THE THIRD WAS TO MARCH UNDER COVER OF SAID HILLS
THE DAY THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN BOSTON MAY SIXTH WARREN HAD ALREADY BEGUN THE REGULAR BLOCKADE ONLY A SINGLE SHIP ELUDED HIM AN ABLY HANDLED BASQUE
DAMN HIS BLOOD SAYS LUKE LET HIM BE AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN AND NOT PRETEND TO BE AN ENGLISHMAN WHEN HE IS A FRENCHMAN IN HIS HEART IF DRINKING TO YOUR SUCCESS WOULD TAKE CAPE BRITTON YOU MUST BE IN POSSESSION OF IT NOW FOR IT'S A STANDING TOAST
THERE WAS AT FIRST MORE RISK OF FOUNDERING ASHORE THAN AFLOAT THERE WERE NEITHER ROADS NOR YET THE MEANS TO MAKE THEM THERE WERE NO HORSES OXEN MULES OR ANY OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORT EXCEPT THE BRAWNY MEN THEMSELVES
THE THIRTEEN PROVINCIAL ARMED VESSELS CARRIED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MEN NO EXACT RETURNS WERE EVER MADE OUT FOR THE TRANSPORTS BUT AS SIXTY EIGHT LAY AT ANCHOR IN CANSO HARBOUR WHILE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN FROM DAY TO DAY
RAISED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EACH RHODE ISLAND CONCURRED BUT UNGRACIOUSLY AND INEFFECTUALLY LATE SHE NURSED TWO GRUDGES AGAINST MASSACHUSETTS ONE ABOUT THE UNDENIABLY HARSH TREATMENT METED OUT TO HER GREAT FOUNDER ROGER WILLIAMS
WHO SENT THEM ON TO BOSTON AFTER BURNING THEIR FORT TO THE GROUND ELATED BY THIS SOMEWHAT ABSURD SUCCESS AND STRENGTHENED BY NEARLY A HUNDRED REGULARS AND FOUR HUNDRED INDIANS WHO RAISED HIS TOTAL FORCE TO AT LEAST A THOUSAND MEN
THERE WAS NO MILITARY LEADER IN THE WHOLE OF NEW ENGLAND SO THE NEXT MOST SUITABLE MAN WAS THE CIVILIAN WHO BEST COMBINED THE NECESSARY QUALITIES OF GOOD SENSE SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND AFFAIRS FIRMNESS DIPLOMACY AND POPULARITY POPULARITY WAS ESSENTIAL
THE PRACTICE CONTINUED TO BE EXCEEDINGLY BAD ON BOTH SIDES SO BAD INDEED THAT THE NEW ENGLANDERS SUFFERED MORE FROM THE BURSTING OF THEIR OWN GUNS THAN FROM THE ENEMY'S FIRE THE NINE INSTRUCTORS COULD NOT BE EVERYWHERE
PEPPERRELL'S MEN CLOSED IN THEIR LINE OF FIRE TILL BESIEGED AND BESIEGERS CAME WITHIN SUCH EASY MUSKET SHOT OF ONE ANOTHER THAT TAUNTING CHALLENGES AND INVITATIONS COULD BE FLUNG ACROSS THE INTERVENING SPACE
A WEEK LATER MAY TWENTY FIRST THE TRANSPORTS JOINED HIM THERE AND LANDED THEIR MILITIAMEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST ECCENTRIC SIEGES EVER KNOWN WHILE THE BRITISH HAD BEEN SPENDING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE IN PREPARING EIGHT THOUSAND MEN
COULD PRODUCE A LETTER LIKE THE FOLLOWING I HOPE THIS WILL FIND YOU AT LOUISBOURG WITH A BOWL OF PUNCH A PIPE AND A PACK OF CARDS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU DESIRE I HAD FORGOT TO MENTION A PRETTY FRENCH MADAMMOSELLE YOUR FRIEND LUKE HAS LOST SEVERAL BEAVER HATTS ALREADY CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION
BECAUSE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE FRENCH AND IN FAVOUR OF THE BRITISH EVEN THE ELEMENTS AS THE ANONYMOUS HABITANT DE LOUISBOURG COMPLAINS IN HIS WONDERFULLY CANDID DIARY SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN SIDES
DISCIPLINE NEVER GOOD HAD BEEN GROWING WORSE PUNISHMENTS WERE UNKNOWN OFFICERS AND MEN WERE PETITIONING FOR LEAVE TO GO HOME QUITE REGARDLESS OF THE NEED FOR THEIR SERVICES AT THE FRONT DEMANDS FOR PROMOTION FOR EXTRA ALLOWANCES
HE AND THEY WERE ON VERY GOOD TERMS BUT THEY WERE PROVINCIAL CAUTIOUS AND NATURALLY SLOW WHEN IT CAME TO PLANNING CAMPAIGNS AND PLEDGING THEIR CREDIT FOR WHAT WAS THEN AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY NOR COULD THEY BE BLAMED
THE MEN VOLUNTEERED EAGERLY THEY WERE ALL VERY KEEN TO FIGHT THE FRENCH MOST OF THEM UNDERSTOOD THE INDIVIDUAL USE OF FIREARMS MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN TO SEA AND HAD LEARNED TO WORK TOGETHER AS A CREW
NO SCHOOLBOYS DEBATING CLUB COULD WELL HAVE DONE WORSE THAN THE COUNCIL HELD TO CONSIDER DU CHAMBON'S STEREOTYPED ANSWER TO THE USUAL SUMMONS SENT IN AT THE BEGINNING OF A SIEGE THE FORMULA THAT HIS CANNON WOULD ANSWER FOR HIM
THE TWENTY TWO POUNDERS HAD REQUIRED TWO HUNDRED MEN APIECE THE FORTY TWO POUNDERS TOOK THREE HUNDRED TWO OF THESE UNWIELDY GUNS WERE HAULED A COUPLE OF MILES ROUND THE HARBOUR IN THE DARK
AT ONCE DECIDED TO WIN CREDIT BY STRIKING THE FIRST BLOW HE WAS MUCH DISLIKED IN LOUISBOURG HE DRANK HARD CURSED HIS SUBORDINATES WHEN IN HIS CUPS AND SET THE WHOLE PLACE BY THE EARS
WHILE THE CREWS COULD HARDLY HAVE MUSTERED LESS THAN AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY MEN EACH THE GRAND TOTAL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPEDITION COULD NOT THEREFORE HAVE BEEN LESS THAN EIGHT THOUSAND MEN OF ALL SORTS PUT TOGETHER OVER FOUR THOUSAND AMERICAN PROVINCIAL MILITIA
BUT HAVING NO ORDERS FROM ENGLAND HE AT FIRST FELT OBLIGED TO REFUSE WITHIN A SHORT TIME HOWEVER HE WAS GIVEN A FREE HAND BY THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT WHICH AUTHORIZED HIM TO CONCERT MEASURES WITH SHIRLEY
TILL HE REACHED THE UNDEFENDED STOREHOUSES ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE NORTH EAST HARBOUR A LITTLE BEYOND THE ROYAL BATTERY THESE HE AT ONCE SET ON FIRE THE PITCH TAR WOOD AND OTHER COMBUSTIBLES MADE A BLINDING SMOKE
NEARLY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE BUT FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN NEVER RECEIVED THEIR MARCHING ORDERS SO THE TOTAL COMBATANTS ONLY AMOUNTED TO SOME ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED
WAS THAT THE ROYAL BATTERY ROARED AGAINST LOUISBOURG THE VERY NEXT MORNING WITH TREMENDOUS EFFECT SMASHING THE WORKS MOST EXPOSED TO ITS FIRE BRINGING DOWN HOUSES ABOUT THE INHABITANTS EARS AND SENDING THE TERRIFIED NON COMBATANTS SCURRYING OFF TO UNDERGROUND COVER
BUT PARSON MOODY MOST TRUCULENT OF PURITANS HAD NO DOUBTS WHATEVER THE FRENCH THE POPE AND THE DEVIL WERE ALL ONE TO HIM AND WHEN HE EMBARKED AS SENIOR CHAPLAIN HE TOOK A HATCHET WITH WHICH TO BREAK DOWN THE GRAVEN IMAGES OF LOUISBOURG
THE PROVINCIALS THOUGHT THE DATE OF HIS ARRIVAL A VERY HAPPY OMEN AS IT FELL ON WHAT WAS THEN ACCORDING TO THE OLD STYLE CALENDAR SAINT GEORGE'S DAY APRIL TWENTY THIRD AFTER A CONFERENCE WITH PEPPERRELL HE HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN THE BLOCKADE OF LOUISBOURG
THE BRITISH ENGINEER AT ANNAPOLIS
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE STORES AND AS THE FRENCH COUNTED NINETY SIX TRANSPORTS MAKING FOR GABARUS BAY
TWO HUNDRED MEN FOR EACH SLEIGH AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT THE WORK SHOULD NOT BE DONE EXCEPT AT NIGHT OR UNDER COVER OF THE FREQUENT FOGS AFTER THIS THINGS WENT MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE BUT THE LABOUR WAS TREMENDOUS STILL
SO WHEN THE LAST TWO HUNDRED MEN HAD WALLOWED THROUGH THE WHOLE ENSNARING BOG WAS SEAMED WITH A PERFECT MAZE OF DECOYING DEATH TRAILS SNAKING IN AND OUT OF THE FORBIDDING SCRUB AND BOULDERS
THE BRITISH RECEIVED A SLIGHT REINFORCEMENT THE FRENCH DID NOT AND IN SEPTEMBER DU VIVIER SUDDENLY RETIRED WITHOUT ATTEMPTING AN ASSAULT THE BURNING OF CANSO AND THE ATTACK ON ANNAPOLIS STIRRED UP THE WRATH OF NEW ENGLAND A WILD ENTHUSIAST
IN SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR WHEN FREDERICK THE GREAT HAD BEGUN THE WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION AND FRANCE HAD TAKEN ARMS AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN DU QUESNEL THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISBOURG WHO HAD RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE OF THESE EVENTS SOME WEEKS BEFORE THE ALERT BOSTONIANS
THEY KNEW THAT ACQUISITIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE CHEATING THEM OUT OF THEIR PROPER RATIONS OF BACON AND BEANS THE OFFICIALS KNEW THAT THE SOLDIERS KNEW AND SO SUSPICION AND RESENTMENT GREW STRONG BETWEEN THEM
REPORTED AGAINST THE SCHEME WHEREUPON EACH HOUSE CARRIED A SECRET ADVERSE VOTE BY A LARGE MAJORITY BUT JUST BEFORE THESE VOTES WERE TAKEN A PURITAN MEMBER FROM A COUNTRY DISTRICT
THEY COULD EITHER LIE DOWN WHERE THEY WERE ON HARD ROCK OR OOZING BOG EXPOSED TO THE ENEMY'S FIRE THE MOMENT IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THE BRITISH BATTERIES OR THEY COULD PLOUGH THEIR WAY BACK TO CAMP HERE THEY WERE SAFE ENOUGH FROM SHOT AND SHELL
THE COMMONEST VIGILANCE OF THE MOST SLOVENLY GARRISON AND EVEN THE OFFENSIVE POWER OF THE GUNS ON THE WALLS OF LOUISBOURG ITSELF SHIRLEY'S PLAN WAS THAT PEPPERRELL SHOULD ARRIVE IN THE OFFING TOO LATE TO BE SEEN LAND UNOBSERVED
AND AGAIN SPARE BRITISH BALLS WERE FOUND TO FIT EXACTLY THE FACT IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD NOW CALL THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN DOING GOOD WORK THE YEAR BEFORE BY SPYING OUT THE LAND AT LOUISBOURG AND REPORTING TO THE PROPER MEN IN BOSTON
BUT WARREN'S BOAT CREWS TOOK HER SOME MEN WHO ESCAPED FROM HER BROUGHT DU CHAMBON THE NEWS THAT A THIRD FRENCH SHIP THE VIGILANT WAS COMING TO THE RELIEF OF LOUISBOURG WITH AMMUNITION AND OTHER STORES
AND FOR INCREASED PAY WERE BECOMING A STANDING NUISANCE THEN JUST AS THE LEADERS WERE AT THEIR WITS ENDS WHAT TO DO MARIN'S THREATENED ATTACK CAME TO THEIR AID AND THEIR BRAVE ARMED MOB ONCE MORE BEGAN TO WEAR THE SEMBLANCE OF AN ARMY
IN THE END WHITEFIELD WARMED UP ENOUGH TO GIVE THE EXPEDITION ITS OFFICIAL MOTTO NIL DESPERANDUM CHRISTO DUCE THE NEVER DESPAIR HEARTENED THE WORLDLINGS
VAUGHAN GALLOPED OFF POST HASTE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH THE FIRST OFFICIAL LETTER GIBSON LED THE MERCHANTS IN LOCAL MILITARY ZEAL THE RESULT WAS THAT MASSACHUSETTS WHICH THEN INCLUDED MAINE RAISED OVER THREE THOUSAND MEN WHILE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND CONNECTICUT
PROVOKED A TREMENDOUS STORM IN THE COUNCIL'S TEACUP AND IMMEDIATELY RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION ADVISED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE TOWNE OF LOUISBOURG BE ATTACKED THIS NIGHT
MANY HOUSES WERE LAID IN RUINS ONLY ONE REMAINED INTACT WHEN THE SIEGE WAS OVER THE NON COMBATANTS WHO NOW EXCEEDED THE GARRISON EFFECTIVES WERE HALF BURIED IN THE SMOTHERING CASEMATES UNDERGROUND AND THOUGH THE FIGHTING MEN HAD LIGHT AIR AND FOOD ENOUGH
WISE ACRES HAD SHAKEN THEIR HEADS OVER THE CRAZY IDEA OF TAKING BRITISH CANNON BALLS SOLELY TO FIT FRENCH CANNON THAT WERE TO BE TAKEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIEGE IT WAS TOO MUCH LIKE SELLING THE PELT BEFORE THE TRAP WAS SPRUNG
THEREFORE IT MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE BRITISH SHIPPING COULD BE SAFE IT WAS THE ONE FRENCH SEA LINK BETWEEN THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW THEREFORE ITS BREAKING WAS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE IT WAS THE ONE REAL FORTRESS EVER HEARD OF IN AMERICA
SENTRIES PIQUETS AND OUTPOSTS APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC OFFICERS WENT THEIR ROUNDS WITH ZEAL THE CAMP SUDDENLY CEASED TO BE A DISORDERLY PLAYGROUND FOR EVERY ONE OFF DUTY THE BREACHING BATTERIES REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS AGAINST THE WALLS
THEY HAD TO HAUL THROUGH BY MAIN FORCE BUT THIS WAS CHILD'S PLAY TO WHAT AWAITED THEM IN THE SLIMY SHIFTING AND BOULDER STREWN BOG THEY HAD TO PASS BEFORE REACHING THE HILLOCKS WHICH COMMANDED LOUISBOURG THE FIRST ATTEMPTS HERE WERE DISASTROUS
NONE OF THEM KNEW MUCH ABOUT ARMIES AND NAVIES MOST THOUGHT LOUISBOURG WAS A REAL TRANSATLANTIC DUNKIRK AND ALL KNEW THAT THEY WERE QUITE INSOLVENT ALREADY
EVEN A MASSACHUSETTS PURITAN COULD RECOMMEND A SERMON FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE CAMP BECAUSE IT WILL PLEASE YOUR WHOLE ARMY AS IT SHOWS THEM THE WAY TO GAIN BY THEIR GALLANTRY THE HEARTS AND AFFECTIONS OF THE LADYS AND EVEN A CITY OF THE GREAT AWAKENING LIKE BOSTON
WITH NEARLY HALF OF THIS TOTAL ON THE SICK LIST AT ONE RATHER CRITICAL JUNCTURE WITH VERY FEW TRAINED GUNNERS AND WITHOUT ANY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AT ALL THE PROVINCIALS ADAPTED THEMSELVES TO THE SITUATION SO DEFIANTLY THAT THEY PUZZLED SHOOK AND OVERAWED THE FRENCH
AND ASTOUNDED THE GENERAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE BY FIRST INDUCING THE MEMBERS TO SWEAR SECRECY AND THEN ASKING THEM TO CONSIDER A PLAN FOR A COLONIAL EXPEDITION AGAINST LOUISBOURG
WHO LITERALLY BUCKLED TO WITH ANCHOR CABLE DRAG ROPES A HUNDRED PAIR OF STRAINING MEN FOR EACH GREAT LUMBERING GUN OVER THE SAND THEY WENT AT A ROMP OVER THE ROCKS THEY HAD TO TAKE CARE AND IN THE DENSE OBSTRUCTING SCRUB
MOREOVER AS IF TO CAP THE CLIMAX
VAUGHAN'S NEXT MOVE WAS TO WRITE A DISPATCH TO PEPPERRELL MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR TO BE INFORMED THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE COURAGE OF THIRTEEN MEN I ENTERED THE ROYAL BATTERY ABOUT NINE O THE CLOCK AND AM WAITING FOR A REINFORCEMENT AND A FLAG
THE NON COMBATANTS NUMBERED NEARLY AS MANY THE CRAMPED HUNDRED ACRES OF IMPRISONED LOUISBOURG THUS CONTAINED ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE MUTINEERS AND MILITIA WOMEN AND CHILDREN DRONES AND OTHER OFFICIALS ALL HUDDLED UP TOGETHER
EACH SIDE CLAIMED ADVANTAGES AND EXPLAINED SHORTCOMINGS TO ITS OWN SATISFACTION A NEW ENGLAND DIARIST SAYS WE BEGAN OUR FIRE WITH AS MUCH FURY AS POSSIBLE AND THE FRENCH RETURNED IT AS WARMLY WITH CANNON MORTARS AND CONTINUAL SHOWERS OF MUSKET BALLS
WHITEFIELD WARNED PEPPERRELL THAT HE WOULD BE ENVIED IF HE SUCCEEDED AND ABUSED IF HE FAILED THE REVEREND THOMAS PRINCE OPENLY REGRETTED THE CHANGE OF ENEMY THE HEAVENLY SHOWER IS OVER FROM FIGHTING THE DEVIL THEY NEEDS MUST TURN TO FIGHTING THE FRENCH
BUT BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK WE HAD BEAT THEM ALL FROM THEIR GUNS A FRENCH DIARIST OF THE SAME DAY SAYS THAT THE FIRE FROM THE WALLS WAS STOPPED ON PURPOSE CHIEFLY TO SAVE POWDER WHILE THE SAME REASON IS ASSIGNED FOR THE BRITISH ORDER TO CEASE FIRE EXACTLY ONE HOUR LATER
THE NEWS FROM BOSTON WAS NOT HEEDED WORSE YET NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE AMERICAN SCOUTING VESSELS WHICH HAD BEEN HOVERING OFF THE COAST FOR MORE THAN A MONTH THE BIBULOUS DU QUESNEL HAD DIED IN OCTOBER BUT HIS SUCCESSOR DU CHAMBON
WARREN IMMEDIATELY SAILED FOR CANSO WITH THREE MEN OF WAR AND SENT FOR ANOTHER TO JOIN HIM HIS WAIT FOR ORDERS MADE HIM NEARLY THREE WEEKS LATER THAN THE NEW ENGLANDERS IN ARRIVING AT THE RENDEZVOUS BUT THIS DELAY DUE TO NO FAULT OF HIS OWN
THAT THE SAID ATTACK BE DEFERRED FOR THE PRESENT THIS PRESENT LASTED DURING THE REST OF THE SIEGE ONCE THE NEW ENGLANDERS HAD SETTLED DOWN HOWEVER THEY WISELY BEGAN TO INCREASE THEIR WEIGHT OF METAL AS WELL AS TO DECREASE THE RANGE AT WHICH THEY USED IT
AND KEPT THEM ALL AT BAY TILL THE REINFORCEMENT AND THE FLAG ARRIVED WITH BRADSTREET WHO WAS AFTERWARDS TO WIN DISTINCTION AS THE CAPTOR OF FORT FRONTENAC DURING THE GREAT CAMPAIGN OF SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE
A MISFORTUNE DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE BUT IN SPITE OF ALL SUCH DRAWBACKS ON THE BRITISH SIDE LOUISBOURG GOT MUCH THE WORST OF IT THE FRENCH HAD TO FIRE FROM THE CENTRE OUTWARDS AT A SEMICIRCLE OF BATTERIES THAT FIRED BACK CONVERGINGLY AT THEM
WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS REDEEMED BY THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT AT A TOTAL COST OF NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION STERLING THERE WAS NO TIME AND THERE WERE NO MEANS TO CHANGE THE MILITIA INTO AN ARMY BUT MANY COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES HELPED TO MAKE UP FOR ITS DEFICIENCIES
PEPPERRELL COULD FIND ONLY SIX AMONG HIS FOUR THOUSAND MEN BUT WARREN LENT HIM THREE MORE WHOM HE COULD ILL SPARE AS NO ONE KNEW WHEN A FLEET MIGHT COME OUT FROM FRANCE WITH THESE NINE INSTRUCTORS TO DIRECT THEM
BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS NO BETTER OFF THAN IN THE BATTERIES MOST MEN'S KITS WERE OF THE VERY SCANTIEST VERY FEW HAD EVEN A SINGLE CHANGE OF CLOTHING A GOOD MANY WENT BARE FOOT NEARLY ALL WERE IN RAGS BEFORE THE SIEGE WAS OVER
PEPPERRELL'S DISPATCHES COULD NOT EXAGGERATE THESE ALMOST INCREDIBLE HARDSHIPS AFLOAT AND ASHORE AWAKE AND ASLEEP THE MEN WERE SOAKING WET FOR DAYS TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE LONGEST HAUL THEY HAD NOTHING BUT A CHOICE OF EVILS
THE GUNS SANK OUT OF SIGHT IN THE ENGULFING BOG WHILE THE TOILING MEN BECAME REGULAR HUMAN TARGETS FOR SHOT AND SHELL FROM LOUISBOURG
MOREOVER MANY OF THOSE UNDER HIM WISHED TO AVOID GIVING THE BRITISH AMERICANS ANY PROVOCATION IN THE HOPE THAT THE WAR MIGHT BE CONFINED TO EUROPE BUT NONE DARED TO REFUSE A LEGAL AND POSITIVE ORDER SO IN MAY HIS EXPEDITION LEFT FOR CANSO
THERE HAD NEVER BEEN SO FINE A SPRING FOR NAVAL OPERATIONS BUT THIS WAS THE ONE THING WHICH WAS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF FRENCH FAULT OR BRITISH MERIT ALL THE OTHER STROKES OF LUCK OWED SOMETHING TO HUMAN CAUSES
THE THREAT OF DANGER ONCE PAST HOWEVER THE MEN SOON SLIPPED BACK INTO THEIR CARELESS WAYS A NEW ENGLAND CHRONICLER RECORDS THAT THOSE WHO WERE ON THE SPOT HAVE FREQUENTLY IN MY HEARING LAUGHED AT THE RECITAL OF THEIR OWN IRREGULARITIES AND EXPRESSED THEIR ADMIRATION
A LARGE OPEN ROADSTEAD RUNNING WEST FROM THE LITTLE LOUISBOURG PENINSULA THE PROVINCIALS EYED THE FORTRESS EAGERLY IT LOOKED MEAN SQUAT AND SHRUNKEN IN THE DIM GREY LIGHT OF EARLY DAWN BUT IT LOOKED HARD ENOUGH FOR ALL THAT ITS ALARM BELLS BEGAN TO RING
A CONSCIENTIOUS DIARIST THOUGH FULL OF SABBATARIAN ZEAL WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT SEVERALL SORTS OF BUSNESSES WAS A GOING ON SUM A EXERCISING SUM A HEARING O THE PREACHING ON MAY FIFTH WARREN SAILED INTO CANSO
NO REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVED AFTER THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE BRITISH FLEET MARIN A WELL KNOWN GUERILLA LEADER HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM QUEBEC THROUGH THE BUSH WITH SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED WHITES AND INDIANS
TENTS WERE SO FEW AND BAD THAT OLD SAILS STRETCHED OVER RIDGE POLES HAD TO BE USED INSTEAD WHEN SAILS RAN SHORT BRUSHWOOD SHELTERS ROOFED IN WITH OVERLAPPING SPRUCE BOUGHS WERE USED AS SUBSTITUTES
IT WAS THE ONE SENTINEL BESIDE THE GATEWAY TO NEW FRANCE THEREFORE IT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN BEFORE QUEBEC AND CANADA WERE ATTACKED IT WAS THE ONE CORSAIR LYING IN PERPETUAL WAIT BESIDE THE BRITISH LINES OF SEABORNE TRADE
BUT CONFRONTED WITH A GREAT DISSATYSFACTION IN MANY OF THE OFFICERS AND SOULDIERS AT THE DESIGNED ATTACK OF THE TOWNE THIS NIGHT IT WAS ADVISED UNANIMOUSLY BY A SECOND COUNCIL CALLED IN GREAT HASTE
THE WHOLE SUBJECT WAS AGAIN DEBATED PROVINCIAL INSOLVENCY AND THE ABSENCE OF EITHER A FLEET OR AN ARMY WERE URGED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THE FIGHTING PARTY PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND PLEADED THAT DELAY MEANT REINFORCEMENTS FOR LOUISBOURG AND A GOOD CHANCE LOST FOR EVER
SHIRLEY WAS DEJECTED AND IN DOUBT WHAT TO DO NEXT BUT JAMES GIBSON THE MERCHANT MILITIAMAN SUDDENLY HIT ON THE IDEA OF GETTING UP A PETITION AMONG THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THE RESULT SURPASSED EVERY EXPECTATION ALL THE MERCHANTS WERE EAGER FOR ATTACK
THE BOSTONIANS HAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO TAKE THE ROYAL BATTERY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT BUT NOBODY HAD THOUGHT THAT THE FRENCH WOULD ABANDON IT WITHOUT A BLOW AND LEAVE IT INTACT FOR THEIR ENEMY WITH ALL ITS ARMAMENT COMPLETE
WRESTLED IN WHAT HE THOUGHT CONFIDENTIAL PRAYER WITH SUCH LOUD EJACULATIONS THAT AN EAVESDROPPER OVERHEARD HIM AND PASSED THE SECRET ON OF COURSE THE MOMENTOUS NEWS AT ONCE BEGAN TO RUN LIKE WILDFIRE THROUGH THE PROVINCE STILL THE NOES HAD IT BOTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE HOUSE
HAVING COMPLETELY OUTDISTANCED THE HANDFUL OF PANTING FRENCHMEN HE LANDED IN PERFECT SAFETY AND PRESENTLY SCATTERED THEM WITH A WILD CHARGE WHICH COST THEM ABOUT TWENTY IN KILLED WOUNDED AND PRISONERS BEFORE DARK TWO THOUSAND PROVINCIALS WERE ASHORE
ON MAY FOURTEENTH THE ENTHUSIASTIC VAUGHAN TOOK SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THESE NEWLY LANDED MEN TO THE TOP OF THE NEAREST HILLOCK AND SALUTED THE WALLS WITH THREE CHEERS HE THEN CIRCLED THE WHOLE HARBOUR KEEPING WELL INLAND
TO BURN THE CARRIAGES OR KNOCK THE TRUNNIONS OFF THE INVALUABLE STORES WERE LEFT IN THEIR PLACES THE ONLY REAL DESTRUCTION WAS CAUSED BY A BARREL OF POWDER WHICH SOME BUNGLERS BLEW UP BY MISTAKE
FROM THAT ROYAL BATTERY WHICH VAUGHAN HAD TAKEN BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE COURAGE OF THIRTEEN MEN AND THEN SUCCESSFULLY MOUNTED AT TITCOMB'S JUST WHERE THEY COULD DO THE GREATEST DAMAGE TO THEIR FORMER OWNERS THE FRENCH WELL TRAINED GUNNERS WERE EXCEEDINGLY SCARCE
THE VOTE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TIE IF A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION HAD NOT SLIPPED AND BROKEN HIS LEG AS HE WAS HURRYING DOWN TO THE HOUSE ONCE THE DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED HOWEVER ALL DID THEIR BEST TO ENSURE SUCCESS SHIRLEY WROTE TO HIS BROTHER GOVERNORS
MESERVE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CAME TO THE RESCUE BY DESIGNING A GUN SLEIGH SIXTEEN FEET IN LENGTH AND FIVE IN THE BEAM THEN THE CREWS WERE TOLD OFF AGAIN
WHO THOUGHT THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN THEY REALLY WERE RECKLESSLY DEFIANT THOUGH THEY WERE HOWEVER THEY DID PROVIDE THE BREACHING BATTERIES WITH ENOUGH COVER FOR THE PURPOSE IN HAND THIS IS AMPLY PROVED BOTH BY THE FEWNESS OF THEIR CASUALTIES
MEANWHILE THE BULK OF THE NEW ENGLANDERS WERE ESTABLISHING THEIR CAMP ALONG THE BROOK WHICH FELL INTO GABARUS BAY BESIDE FLAT POINT AND WITHIN TWO MILES OF LOUISBOURG EQUIPMENT OF ALL KINDS WAS VERY SCARCE
THOUGH THEY HAD ONE QUITE ALARMING SCARE ASHORE THEY KNEW THEIR NAVY OUTMATCHED THE FRENCH AND THEY SAW THAT WHILE WARREN WAS BEING STRENGTHENED DU CHAMBON WAS BEING LEFT AS DEVOID OF NAVAL FORCE AS EVER
VAUGHAN FOLLOWED AT ONCE AND A YOUNG VOLUNTEER SHINNING UP THE FLAG POLE MADE HIS OWN RED COAT FAST TO THE TOP THIS DEFIANCE WAS IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED BY A RANDOM SALVO FROM LOUISBOURG LESS THAN A MILE ACROSS THE HARBOUR
OVER ONE THOUSAND MEN OF THE ROYAL NAVY QUITE ONE THOUSAND MEN ABOARD THE PROVINCIAL FIGHTING VESSELS AND AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND MORE AS CREWS TO WORK THE TRANSPORTS MAY FIRST THE FIRST SUNDAY THE PROVINCIALS SPENT AT CANSO
WITHOUT A SIEGE AND LEFT ONE SLEEPY SENTRY TO WATCH WOLFE'S COVE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE OF THE PLAINS IT IS TRUE THAT DU CHAMBON HAD SUCCEEDED TO A THOROUGHLY BAD COMMAND
WHILE THE DANGER FROM RANDOM SHELLS BURSTING AMONG THE BOULDERS WAS NOT TO BE DESPISED FOUR HUNDRED STRUGGLING FEET FOUR HUNDRED STRAINING ARMS EACH TEAM HOVE ON ITS LONG TAUT CABLE THROUGH FOG RAIN AND THE BLACKNESS OF THE NIGHT
THEY SET TO WORK WITH A WILL TO MAKE A BREACH AT THE NORTH WEST GATE OF LOUISBOURG NEAR WHERE THE INNER ANGLE OF THE WALLS ABUTTED ON THE HARBOUR AND THEY CERTAINLY NEEDED ALL THEIR INDOMITABLE PERSEVERANCE WHEN IT CAME TO ARMING THEIR NEW NORTH WESTERN OR TITCOMB'S BATTERY
THE ROCKS AND BOGS OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY THE DIFFICULTIES OF ENTERING A NARROW NECKED HARBOUR UNDER A COMBINATION OF END ON AND BROADSIDE FIRE THE TERRIBLE LEE SHORE OFF THE ISLANDS REEFS AND LIGHTHOUSE POINT
BUT THEIR STILL GREATER CONFIDENCE ASHORE WAS FOR THE TIME BEING VERY RUDELY SHAKEN WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MARIN THE SAME FRENCH GUERILLA LEADER WHO HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM QUEBEC AGAINST ANNAPOLIS WITH SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED WHITES AND INDIANS
THE ONLY OTHER FORCE WAS THE MILITIA WHICH WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS COMPRISED EVERY MALE INHABITANT OF CAPE BRETON WHO COULD STAND ON TWO LEGS AND HOLD A MUSKET WITH BOTH HANDS THERE WERE BOYS IN THEIR EARLY TEENS AND OLD MEN IN THEIR SIXTIES
WAS NOT MANAGED ACCORDING TO SHIRLEY'S WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS NOR WAS THE SIEGE SHIRLEY HAD BEEN PLAYING A LITTLE WAR GAME IN HIS STUDY WITH ALL THE INCONVENIENT OBSTACLES LEFT OUT
NEARLY ALL OF THEM HAD THE HANDINESS THEN REQUIRED FOR LIFE IN A NEW COUNTRY AND WHAT WITH CONVICTION AND WHAT WITH PREJUDICE THEY WERE ALSO QUITE DISPOSED TO LOOK UPON THE EXPEDITION AS A SORT OF CRUSADE AGAINST IDOLATROUS PAPISTS
THE OTHER TWO THOUSAND LANDED AT THEIR LEISURE THE FOLLOWING DAY THE NEXT EVENT IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY SIEGE IS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF WAR
AND THOUGH THEY WERE LOSING VERY FEW IN KILLED AND WOUNDED THEY TOO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT LOUISBOURG MUST FALL IF IT WAS NOT SOON RELIEVED FROM OUTSIDE THE BRITISH ON THE CONTRARY GREW MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT BOTH AFLOAT AND ASHORE
AND REPORTED THEM SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED WHERE THE PROVINCIALS SHOWED THEIR PRENTICE HANDS TO GENUINE DISADVANTAGE WAS IN THEIR ABSURDLY SOLEMN AND UTTERLY FUTILE COUNCILS OF WAR
SINCE NONE OF THEM RECOGNIZED ANY COMMON AUTHORITY EXCEPT THAT OF THE CROWN HE WAS ABLY SECONDED BY MANY LEADING MEN WHO IF NOT TRAINED SOLDIERS WERE AT LEAST ACCUSTOMED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC LIFE
AND THIS TIME A GENERAL ATTACK ON ACADIA BUT THESE OTHER TWO THOUSAND WERE NEVER SENT AND MARIN HAVING FAILED TO TAKE ANNAPOLIS BY THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE WAS TOO LATE AND TOO WEAK TO HELP LOUISBOURG AFTERWARDS THE SAME ILL LUCK PURSUED THE FRENCH BY SEA
ITS SIGNAL CANNON FIRED AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LIVING OUTSIDE HURRIED IN BEHIND THE WALLS THE NEW ENGLANDERS WERE SO KEEN TO LAND THAT THEY RAN SOME DANGER OF FALLING INTO COMPLETE DISORDER BUT PEPPERRELL MANAGED VERY CLEVERLY
AND ALL THEIR GOOD ADVICE COULD NOT PREVENT THE EAGER AMATEURS FROM GROSSLY OVERLOADING THE DOUBLE SHOTTED PIECES ANOTHER FORTY TWO POUND GUN BURST AT THE GRAND BATTERY CAPTAIN HALE IS DANGEROUSLY HURT BY THE BURSTING OF ANOTHER GUN
AND THE MILITARY FORCE HAD BECOME WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER
IN THIS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SIEGE IT TOOK AT LEAST A HORSE'S WEIGHT AS WELL THE APPROACH TO THE WALLS DEFIED ALL THE USUAL PRECAUTIONS OF REGULAR WAR BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFIED ITS BOLDNESS WITH ONLY FOUR THOUSAND MEN AT THE START
AND IT WAS IN ABSOLUTELY ALIEN HANDS THEREFORE SO RAN NEW ENGLAND LOGIC IT WAS MOST OFFENSIVE TO ALL TRUE BRITONS NEW ENGLANDERS AND PURITANS TO ALL RIVALS IN SMUGGLING TRADE AND PRIVATEERING AND TO ALL RIGHT THINKING PEOPLE GENERALLY
THE MOUNTAINS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY SEEMED LIKE BLUE CLOUDS STRETCHING OUT OVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD EVEN THE PEAK COULD NOT GIVE HIM A BETTER VIEW THAN THIS DAVID GAZED UP THE FACE OF A SCARP
THE PHOENIX FLEW UP INTO THE DARKNESS ONCE MORE THE TINKERING SOUNDS BEGAN AGAIN AND A SPURT OF FALLING DEBRIS RATTLED IN THE LEAVES OF THE HEDGE SUDDENLY IT HAPPENED
THE PHOENIX BEAT AT THE SMOLDERING SPARKS IN ITS TAIL AND FLEW OFF LEAVING A TRAIL OF ACRID SMOKE HANGING IN THE AIR DAVID HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO GATHER UP ALL THE TOOLS THE WIRE BELL AND PUSHBUTTON
BASILISKS NYMPHS AH AND MANY OTHERS ALL ARE OF THE BETTER SORT SINCE AS I HAVE MANY TIMES TRULY OBSERVED ONE IS KNOWN BY THE COMPANY ONE KEEPS AND YOUR EDUCATION WILL COST YOU NOTHING
NOW WE MAKE A NOOSE SO FROM A PIECE OF ROPE TIE IT TO THE END OF THE SAPLING AND SPREAD THE LOOP OUT ON THE PATH THIS WAY THE WHOLE SNARE IS HIDDEN UNDER GRASS AND LEAVES
THE UNWARY FOOTSTEP THE SAPLING JARRED OUT OF THE NOTCH SPRINGING UPWARD THE TIGHTENED NOOSE AND OUR ARCHENEMY DANGLING BY THE FOOT IN MID AIR COMPLETELY AT OUR MERCY MAGNIFICENT GOLLY PHOENIX SAID DAVID THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER
IT SOOTHED AWAY THE HURT OF HIS ACHING MUSCLES AND THE STING OF HIS SCRATCHES HE ROLLED OVER ON HIS BACK AND CUSHIONED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THE SKY SEEMED TO BE SLIPPING ALONG OVERHEAD LIKE A BROAD BLUE RIVER THE BREEZE RUFFLED HIS HAIR
HE FELT LIKE SHOUTING WHEN AT LAST HE REACHED THE LEDGE TRULY IT WAS AN ENCHANTED PLACE IT WAS A LONG LEVEL STRIP OF GROUND SEVERAL YARDS WIDE CARPETED WITH SHORT GRASS AND DANDELIONS BUSHES GREW ALONG MOST OF THE OUTER EDGE
THE TELEPHONE POLE IS SIMPLY LOADED DOWN WITH POWER LINES WAITING TO BE TAPPED THE PHOENIX WAS EVIDENTLY SET ON CARRYING OUT THE PLAN AND DAVID DID NOT WANT TO WEAR OUT THE BIRD'S PATIENCE WITH MORE OBJECTIONS AND WELL WHY NOT
THERE WERE TERRACES LEDGES KNOLLS RAVINES AND EMBANKMENTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE EXCITING PART OF IT WAS THAT EACH FEATURE CONCEALED THE ONES ABOVE IT
EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION DAD WAS PUSHING CHAIRS AND TABLES AROUND IN AN AIMLESS WAY MOTHER WAS SAYING THEY'LL ALL HAVE TO GO OUT AGAIN WE FORGOT TO PUT DOWN THE RUG FIRST
AND POLICE CARS PULLED UP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EVERYONE IN THE BLOCK TURNED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED IT TOOK THE REPAIR MEN AN HOUR TO UNTANGLE THE WIRES AND FIX THEM
UNDERSTAND ME I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST A CLASSICAL EDUCATION AS SUCH I REALIZE THAT MATHEMATICS GREEK AND LATIN ARE EXCELLENT FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND BUT IN THE BROAD VIEW A CLASSICAL EDUCATION IS NOT A TRUE EDUCATION
THERE WAS A THRASHING SOUND IN THE THICKET AND THE PHOENIX APPEARED LOOKING VERY RUMPLED AND YAWNING BEHIND ITS WING GREETINGS MY BOY IT CRIED A SPLENDID MORNING THEN THE PHOENIX CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PAPER BAG IN DAVID'S HAND AND SWALLOWED IN A SUGGESTIVE WAY
TURNING OUT ALL THE LIGHTS SO HE CAN MURDER US IN OUR BEDS LOOK DAVID SHOUTED THE LINE'S BROKEN IN OUR BACK YARD THEY COULD HEAR THE WAILING OF SIRENS NOW FIRE TRUCKS REPAIR TRUCKS
WORDS FAIL ME I'M GLAD YOU LIKE THEM DAVID SAID POLITELY AND NOW MY BOY CONTINUED THE PHOENIX AS IT SETTLED BACK COMFORTABLY I HAVE BEEN THINKING YESTERDAY YOU SHOWED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN MY PROBLEMS AND ASKED INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS
I THINK THEY'RE OPEN TILL SIX SAID DAVID SHAKING THE SAND OUT OF HIS SHOES ARE WE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING PRECISELY MY BOY A HARDWARE STORE SHOULD HAVE WHAT WE NEED NOW YOU WILL TAKE OUR GOLD AND PURCHASE THE FOLLOWING
GRYFFENS AH WELL THE MOST ANYONE CAN SAY FOR THEM IS THAT THEY ARE HARMLESS THEY ARE VERY STUPID I SEE SAID DAVID DOUBTFULLY WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE EACH LOOKS LIKE THE OTHERS MY BOY EXCEPT THAT SOME ARE BIGGER AND SOME ARE SMALLER
IT DID NOT SEEM VERY PRACTICAL TO DAVID WELL PHOENIX THAT'S A GOOD IDEA HE SAID CAREFULLY BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO HIDE THE WIRES AND WHAT ABOUT THE NOISE OF THE BELL NOTHING TO IT MY BOY THE WIRES
FEELING THE SUNLIGHT ON HIS FACE AND LISTENING TO THE RUSTLE OF THE WIND IN THE THICKET AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE PHOENIX AFTER A BRILLIANT DISPLAY OF ACROBATICS LANDED ON THE LEDGE CLASPED ITS WINGS BEHIND ITS BACK AND LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT DAVID
GOLLY I DIDN'T SEE YOU AT ALL AND IT ISN'T EVEN DARK YET I HAVE BEEN HUNTED LONG ENOUGH MY BOY TO HAVE LEARNED A FEW TRICKS IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF GLIDING CLOSE TO THE GROUND SELECTING THE BEST SHADOWS AND KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT
OH SAID DAVID DO YOU MEAN ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME LESSONS THROUGH HIS MIND FLASHED A PICTURE OF THE PHOENIX WITH SPECTACLES ON ITS BEAK AND A RULER IN ITS WING WRITING OUT SENTENCES ON A BLACKBOARD
DAVID'S CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE WISE TO BE CAUTIOUS THE NOISE DID NOT SOUND DANGEROUS BUT WELL HE HAD NEVER BEEN UP A MOUNTAIN BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT HE MIGHT FIND
BUT DAD SAID I DON'T SEE WHY NOT DO YOU AND LOOKED TO MOTHER FOR AGREEMENT MOTHER SAID WELL BE VERY CAREFUL IN A DOUBTFUL TONE AND THAT WAS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL FIND WHEN YOU CLIMB A MOUNTAIN
OF COURSE YOU CANNOT MY BOY THE PLAN IS FAR TOO PROFOUND FOR YOU TO GUESS WHAT IT IS BUT SET YOUR MIND AT REST I SHALL NOW EXPLAIN THE ROPE AND HATCHET DAVID LEANED FORWARD EAGERLY NOW SCIENTISTS YOU KNOW HAVE FIXED HABITS
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AGREEABLE IF YOU COULD SUPPLY ME WITH COOKIES FROM TIME TO TIME AS MANY AS YOU WANT PHOENIX WILL WE GO TO AFRICA NATURALLY MY BOY YOUR EDUCATION WILL INCLUDE AND EGYPT AND CHINA AND ARABIA YES YOUR EDUCATION WILL
DO NOT BE SO DENSE MY DEAR FELLOW I SHALL CARRY YOU ON MY BACK OF COURSE OH SAID DAVID WEAKLY ON YOUR ON YOUR BACK ARE YOU SURE THAT ISN'T THERE SOME OTHER I MEAN CAN YOU DO IT THE PHOENIX DREW ITSELF UP TO ITS FULL HEIGHT
WHATEVER THE PLAN WAS THEY WOULD HAVE TO CARRY IT OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TWO DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE THE SCIENTIST HAD SHOWN UP THE NEW GUN HE HAD ORDERED MIGHT ARRIVE AT ANY TIME NOW PERHAPS EVEN TODAY WHEN THEY HAD BEEN DIGGING UP THE PIRATE TREASURE
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT MY BOY THE FELINE'S EXISTENCE WAS TERMINATED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ITS INQUISITIVENESS WHAT DID YOU SAY CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT EXPLAINED THE PHOENIX OH BUT
AUNT AMY WAS MAKING SHORT DASHES BETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM MUTTERING TO HERSELF AND BECKIE WAS ROARING IN HER CRIB BECAUSE IT WAS TIME FOR HER BOTTLE DAVID ASKED
WHILE DAVID GAZED UP DOUBTFULLY AT THE SHADOWY MAZE OF LINES AND INSULATORS ON THE CROSS ARMS ELECTRICITY SAID THE PHOENIX THOUGHTFULLY IS A COMPLICATED AND PROFOUND SUBJECT
AND I SHOULD BE AVOIDING MY CLEAR CUT DUTY IF I DID NOT TAKE THIS TASK IN HAND MYSELF OF COURSE I SUPPOSE SOME ATTEMPT TO EDUCATE YOU HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE HAS IT NOT WELL I GO TO SCHOOL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN NOT NOW THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S SUMMER VACATION
NOW RUN ALONG MY BOY A VERY IMPORTANT THOUGHT HAS JUST COME TO ME I MUST MEDITATE A WHILE THE PHOENIX GLANCED AT THE THICKET AND HID A YAWN BEHIND ONE WING OH ALL RIGHT SAID DAVID I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING THEN
THE FULL BENEFIT OF MY VAST KNOWLEDGE PLUS A NUMBER OF TRIPS TO OH TRAVELING SAID DAVID SUDDENLY FEELING MUCH BETTER THAT'S DIFFERENT OH PHOENIX THAT'LL BE WONDERFUL WHERE WILL WE GO EVERYWHERE MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX WITH AN AIRY WAVE OF ITS WING
A TREMENDOUS RUSH OF AIR SNATCHED AT HIS SHIRT HE OPENED HIS EYES AND CHOKED WITH FRIGHT THE GROUND BELOW WAS RUSHING UP TO MEET THEM SWAYING AND REVOLVING SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG THE PHOENIX WAS BREATHING IN HOARSE GASPS
WAS IT A BIRD OF SOME SORT OR JUST ONE OF THOSE DOTS THAT SWIM BEFORE YOUR EYES WHEN YOU STARE TOO LONG AT THE SKY IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE THE MOUNTAIN WAVING ITS HAND AS IF TO SAY THAT IT WAS QUITE ALL RIGHT FOR HIM TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING
DAVID THRUST THE BAG OF COOKIES BEHIND HIS BACK NOW PHOENIX HE SAID FIRMLY YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GO AWAY TO SOUTH AMERICA YOU SAID LAST NIGHT THAT IT COULD BE ARRANGED SO LET'S ARRANGE IT RIGHT NOW UNTIL WE DO NOT ONE
WHERE HE BOUGHT WHAT THE PHOENIX WANTED A COIL OF ROPE AN ELECTRIC DOOR BELL A PUSHBUTTON AND ONE HUNDRED FEET OF INSULATED WIRE THEN HE BROUGHT THE PACKAGE HOME
AND UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS I CAN DO IT QUITE SAFELY THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW WILL YOU KNOW WHEN I HAVE ARRIVED THAT MY BOY IS THE NUB OR CRUX OF THE SITUATION A DIFFICULT PROBLEM YOU WILL ADMIT BUT I HAVE WORKED OUT THE SOLUTION
WITH A TREMENDOUS SURGE OF ITS WINGS THE PHOENIX MANAGED TO GET ONE CLAW OVER THE EDGE AND TO SEIZE THE BRANCH OF A BUSH IN ITS BEAK DAVID'S LEGS SLIPPED FROM THE BIRD'S BACK HE DANGLED OVER THE ABYSS FROM THE OUTSTRETCHED NECK AND PRAYED
LIFE IS REAL LIFE IS EARNEST ONE MUST FACE IT WITH A PRACTICAL EDUCATION THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE MY DEAR FELLOW CLASSICAL EDUCATION COMPLETELY IGNORES THEM FOR EXAMPLE HOW DO YOU TELL A TRUE UNICORN FROM A FALSE ONE I
THEN IT WOULD FADE AND BE DROWNED OUT BY THE BREEZE HARD TO SAY WHY BUT IT JUST DID NOT SEEM TO FIT THERE DAVID PROPPED HIMSELF UP ON HIS ELBOWS AND LISTENED MORE INTENTLY THE SOUND FADED HE HAD BEEN IMAGINING IT
THE PHOENIX LOWERED ITS VOICE IMPRESSIVELY MY BOY WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL THIS BELL IN YOUR ROOM AND THE PUSHBUTTON ON THE BASE OF THAT TELEPHONE POLE
FOR A WHOLE MINUTE HE STOOD THERE NOT DARING TO LOOK UP THEN HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH CLENCHED HIS HANDS TIGHTLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD THERE IT WAS AS DAD HAD DESCRIBED IT BUT INFINITELY MORE GRAND
HE FELT BETTER THEN AND RETURNED MORE CHEERFULLY TO THE MOVING IT WAS LONG AFTER DARK BEFORE THE MOVING VAN DROVE AWAY BECKIE CROONED HAPPILY OVER HER BOTTLE AND THE REST OF THEM GATHERED IN THE KITCHEN FOR A LATE SUPPER OF SANDWICHES AND CANNED SOUP
TO THE TOP OF THE POLE DAVID COULD HEAR THE CREAK OF THE LINES UNDER THE PHOENIX'S WEIGHT AND THE RATTLING OF THE SCREW DRIVER AGAINST THE PORCELAIN INSULATORS FOR SOME MINUTES THE PHOENIX INVESTIGATED CLICKING AND SCRAPING ABOUT AND MUTTERING QUITE SO AND THERE WE ARE
HE PROGRESSED BY INCHES PUSHING WITH HIS TOES PULLING WITH HIS FINGER TIPS WRIGGLING WITH THE REST OF HIS BODY
THEY SAT DOWN AND LOOKED PROUDLY AT EACH OTHER MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX I HAVE HAD A WIDE AND SOMETIMES PAINFUL EXPERIENCE WITH TRAPS
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL TELL ME WHEN IT'S TIME BUT WHATEVER IT IS WE'D BETTER DO IT RIGHT NOW THE SCIENTIST MAY SHOW UP ANY MINUTE PRECISELY MY BOY NEVER PUT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW WHAT CAN BE DONE TODAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROVERBS
PHOENIX PLEASE TELL ME WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I DON'T CARE IF CURIOSITY DID KILL THE CAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE ROPE AND WIRE AND BELL ALL NIGHT AND I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OUT OF IT THE PHOENIX GAVE A PLEASED LAUGH
IT SWEPT UPWARD FROM THE VALLEY FLOOR BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED AND SOARING SO TALL THAT ITS MISTY BLUE PEAK COULD SURELY TALK FACE TO FACE WITH THE STARS TO DAVID WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A MOUNTAIN BEFORE
MORE EMBARRASSING QUESTIONS WELL HE WOULD HAVE TO ROB HIS BANK BUT WAIT WHY HADN'T HE REMEMBERED JUST BEFORE THEY HAD MOVED UNCLE CHARLES HAD GIVEN HIM A TEN DOLLAR BILL AS A FAREWELL PRESENT HE HAD BEEN SAVING IT FOR A MODEL AIRPLANE
EARLY NEXT MORNING DAVID CLIMBED UP TO THE LEDGE BRINGING WITH HIM THE COIL OF ROPE AND THE HATCHET AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT HE HAD ADDED A PAPER BAG FULL OF COOKIES HERE'S THE STUFF PHOENIX HE CALLED OUT AS HE STEPPED ONTO THE LEDGE WHERE ARE YOU
AND WHAT DO THEY TEACH YOU THERE OH READING AND WRITING AND ARITHMETIC AND THINGS LIKE THAT AHA SAID THE PHOENIX TRIUMPHANTLY JUST AS I SUSPECTED A CLASSICAL EDUCATION
FIRST WE FIND A SAPLING AND CLEAR THE BRANCHES FROM IT WITH THE HATCHET LIKE THIS NEXT WE GET A STAKE CUT A NOTCH IN IT AND DRIVE IT INTO THE GROUND SO THE SAPLING IS BENT DOWN TO IT AND FITTED INTO THE NOTCH WHICH HOLDS IT DOWN YOU SEE MY BOY
WE SHALL BURN THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE REACH IT MY BOY NOW DO YOU HAVE THE PLIERS WIRE CUTTERS AND SCREW DRIVER BELOW YES THEY'RE DOWN IN THE CELLAR WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM PHOENIX PATIENCE PATIENCE
PUT IN THIS WAY THE IDEA HAD A CERTAIN APPEAL AND DAVID FOUND HIMSELF WARMING TO IT BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER HOW ABOUT ELECTRICITY PHOENIX LOOK ABOVE YOU MY BOY
OUR PARTICULAR SCIENTIST IS A DAYTIME CREATURE THAT IS TO SAY HE COMES AT DAWN AND GOES AT DUSK HIS INVARIABLE HABIT MY BOY WELL THERE YOU ARE MY BOY SAID THE PHOENIX TRIUMPHANTLY
FLINGING THE ASTONISHED PHOENIX THIRTY FEET UP THE MOUNTAINSIDE
THE SIGHT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH TO BEAR HE FELT SO TIGHT AND SHIVERY INSIDE THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER HE WANTED TO LAUGH OR CRY OR BOTH AND THE REALLY WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN WAS THE WAY IT LOOKED AT HIM
ITS WINGS WERE POUNDING THE AIR FRANTICALLY NOW THEY HAD TURNED BACK THE SCARP LOOMED BEFORE THEM SOLID AND BLANK ABOVE THEM HIGH ABOVE THEM WAS THE LEDGE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NOT GET BACK TO IT UP UP UP
THE COVERING ON THE LINES IS RATHER TOUGH HOWEVER WE SHALL HAVE TO USE THE WIRE CUTTERS THE PHOENIX RETURNED TO THE TOP OF THE POLE WITH THE CUTTERS AND WORKED ON THE WIRES FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES BITS OF DEBRIS BEGAN TO SHOWER DOWN ON THE HEDGE
ONE DOES NOT FIGHT FATE DOES ONE I SUPPOSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I MUST ACCEPT IT'S SETTLED THEN DAVID CRIED JOYFULLY SO THEY SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS TOGETHER
BUT DAVID COULD NOT EAT UNTIL HE HAD FOUND THE COURAGE TO ASK ONE QUESTION MAY I CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN TOMORROW AUNT AMY MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT LANDSLIDES WHICH WERE FIRMLY FIXED IN HER MIND AS THE FATE OF PEOPLE WHO CLIMBED MOUNTAINS
WE SHALL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY HERE THE PHOENIX CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BAG IN DAVID'S HAND AND ADDED HASTILY BUT OF COURSE WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT FIRST THINGS COME FIRST YOU MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT MORE SAID THE PHOENIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THERE WEREN'T ANY MORE IN THE JAR DAVID SAID
THE TWANGING AND SNAPPING AS IT TUMBLED THROUGH THE WIRES A DRAWN OUT SQUAWK AND THE FLOP OF WINGS IN THE AIR BELOW THE CRASH INTO THE HEDGE THE JARRING THUD AGAINST THE GROUND BROKEN WIRES BEGAN TO SPUTTER OMINOUSLY AND FIRE OUT SPARKS
THE THOUGHT GAVE HIM A SINKING FEELING AFTER ALL IT WAS SUMMER AND SUMMER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VACATION TIME AND WHAT AN EDUCATION IT WILL BE THE PHOENIX WENT ON IGNORING HIS QUESTION ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT EQUAL
WELL MY COURSE IS CLEAR SAID THE PHOENIX FIRMLY I MUST PRACTICE SETTING UP EXERCISES ROADWORK AND WHAT NOT RIGOROUS DIET LOTS OF SLEEP REGULAR HOURS COURAGE MY DEAR FELLOW WE SHALL DO IT YET
AND THE DISTANCE HE HAD ALREADY COVERED WAS A CONSIDERABLE ONE HE LOOKED BACK THE TOWN LOOKED LIKE A MODEL OF A TOWN WITH LITTLE TOY HOUSES AND DIFFERENT COLORED ROOFS AMONG THE TREES THAT MADE A DARKER PATCH ON THE PATTERN OF THE VALLEY FLOOR
THEN THERE WOULD BE A FIFTEEN MINUTE REST AND REFRESHMENT PERIOD AND WHEN THAT WAS OVER THE PHOENIX WOULD LAUNCH ITSELF INTO THE AIR THIS WAS THE PART DAVID LIKED BEST IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SIGHT
WHEELED IN CIRCLES SHOT STRAIGHT UP LIKE A ROCKET PLUNGED HOVERED LOOPED ROLLED SOARED FLUTTERED NOW AND THEN IT WOULD SWOOP BACK TO THE LEDGE BESIDE DAVID AND WIPE THE SWEAT FROM ITS BROW I TRUST YOU SEE SIGNS OF PROGRESS MY BOY
COULD HAVE DONE EVEN THIS MUCH THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT YOU ARE A LOT PUFF HEAVIER THAN YOU LOOK I HOPE YOU ARE NOT BEING OVERFED AT HOME I I DON'T KNOW SAID DAVID WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GOING TO BE SICK
THE PHOENIX BEAMED AND FLUNG OUT ITS WINGS IN A DRAMATIC GESTURE JUST PICTURE IT MY DEAR CHAP
CLEVER MY BOY BETTER TO SAY A STROKE OF GENIUS ONLY I PHOENIX COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AND CONSIDER THE POETIC JUSTICE OF IT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF TRAP THAT THE SCIENTIST ONCE SET FOR ME
GRYFFINS GRYFFONS GRYFFENS EXCUSE ME DAVID INTERRUPTED WHAT WERE THOSE LAST THREE PLEASE GRYFFINS EXPLAINED THE PHOENIX ARE THE SMALL REDDISH FRIENDLY ONES GRYFFONS ARE THE QUICK TEMPERED PROUD ONES
CAN I DO ANYTHING HOPING THAT THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO C'MERE AUNT AMY SAID GRABBING HIM BY THE ARM HELP ME LOOK FOR THAT IRONING BOARD WHEN THE IRONING BOARD WAS FINALLY LOCATED MOTHER HAD SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
THE PHOENIX WOULD TAKE WING AGAIN AND DAVID WOULD SETTLE BACK AGAINST A ROCK AND WATCH SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT OF THE EDUCATION HE WAS TO GET SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF HE COULD FLY AND SOMETIMES HE DID NOT THINK AT ALL BUT JUST SAT WITH HIS EYES HALF SHUT
HE DROPPED INTO A CROUCH AND CREPT SILENTLY UP TO THE TANGLE OF BUSHES HIS HEART BEGAN TO POUND AND HE SWALLOWED TO RELIEVE THE DRYNESS IN HIS THROAT THE NOISE WAS MUCH MORE DISTINCT NOW AND IT SOUNDED LIKE LIKE
SOMEHOW IN ALL THE RUSH AND CONFUSION THE AFTERNOON HAD DISAPPEARED ALREADY THE EVENING SUN WAS THROWING SHADOWS ACROSS THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
THERE WAS A CRASH FROM THE THICKET AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD JUMPED UP IN IT SUDDENLY AND THE PHOENIX STUMBLED OUT RUBBING ITS EYES AH SPLENDID MY BOY YES I WAS JUST AH THINKING PHOENIX SAID DAVID I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN WHAT YOUR PLAN IS
UNTIL THE GREEN AND TAWNY FADED INTO HAZY HEIGHTS OF ROCK IT WAS WAITING FOR HIM COME AND CLIMB IT WHISPERED COME AND CLIMB BUT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO FIRST THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEW HOUSE
AT THE TOP OF A RISE WOULD BE AN OUTCROPPING OF STRANGELY COLORED ROCK INVISIBLE FROM BELOW BEYOND THE OUTCROPPING A SMALL STAND OF ASPENS WOULD QUIVER IN THE BREEZE THEIR QUICKSILVER LEAVES HIDING A TINY MEADOW ON THE SLOPE BEHIND
HE STEPPED BACK QUICKLY WITH A SHUDDER LET'S LET'S DO IT TOMORROW HE QUAVERED NONSENSE SAID THE PHOENIX FIRMLY NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
NO HE HAD NOT BEEN IMAGINING IT THERE IT WAS AGAIN HE SAT UP NOW HE NOTICED THAT THE LEDGE WAS DIVIDED BY A THICKET WHICH GREW FROM THE INNER SIDE TO THE OUTER THE NOISE WHATEVER IT WAS CAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THICKET
DAVID WOULD WRAP THE WET TOWEL AROUND THE PHOENIX'S NECK YOU'RE DOING BETTER AND BETTER PHOENIX I ESPECIALLY LIKE THAT PART WHERE YOU TWIST OVER ON YOUR BACK AND LOOP AND PLUNGE ALL AT THE SAME TIME I DO PERFORM THAT RATHER WELL DON'T I
YOU DID NOT SCOFF AS OTHERS MIGHT HAVE DONE YOU HAVE VERY RARE QUALITIES DAVID FLUSHED AND MUMBLED DENIALS DO NOT BE SO MODEST MY BOY I SPEAK THE TRUTH IT CAME TO ME THAT SUCH A MIND AS YOURS HAVING THESE QUALITIES SHOULD BE FURTHER CULTIVATED AND REFINED
JUST IMAGINE IT THE PHOENIX CONTINUED ENTHUSIASTICALLY PERHAPS LATER WE CAN INSTALL ANOTHER BELL AT THIS END THEN WE COULD LEARN MORSE CODE AND SEND MESSAGES TO EACH OTHER EXACTLY LIKE A PRIVATE TELEPHONE LINE
IT IS NOT EASY BUT JUST THE THING FOR ACQUIRING OUCH MUSCLE TONE ARE THERE ANY MORE COOKIES AH THERE ARE DELICIOUS AS I WAS SAYING LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU MY BOY IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED TRY TRY AGAIN
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE GOT HOME THAT HE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING HE COULDN'T SPEND PIRATE GOLD PIECES OR EVEN SHOW THEM TO ANYONE WITHOUT BEING ASKED A LOT OF EMBARRASSING QUESTIONS WHAT TO DO ASK DAD OR MOTHER OR AUNT AMY TO LEND HIM SOME MONEY
AND FITTING IT INTO THE NOTCH IT TOOK THE WEIGHT OF BOTH OF THEM TO BRING THE SAPLING TO THE GROUND IF THEY GOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT OFF BALANCE IT WOULD SPRING UP AGAIN ONCE DAVID FELL OFF THE SAPLING WENT SWISH BACK INTO THE AIR
THERE SHOULD BE NO HARM IN TRYING IT OUT ANYWAY THEY GATHERED UP THE TOOLS AND WALKED ALONG THE HEDGE TO THE TELEPHONE POLE WHICH WAS IN ONE CORNER OF THE YARD THE PHOENIX BEGAN TO UNCOIL THE WIRE
THE PHOENIX DREW ITSELF UP INDIGNANTLY MY VERY DEAR FELLOW IT SAID YOU WOUND ME YOU CUT ME TO THE QUICK I WILL NOT BE BRIBED I IT STOPPED AND SWALLOWED AGAIN OH WELL IT CONTINUED MORE MILDLY
NEVER FEAR MY BOY I THOUGHT OF THAT ALSO WE ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT A SNARE AT EACH END OF THE LEDGE HOW HAND ME THAT TWIG MY BOY THE PHOENIX TOOK THE TWIG FOUND A BARE SPOT OF EARTH AND SKETCHED A PICTURE
YOU WILL BE TOLD WHEN THE TIME COMES I SHALL MEET YOU TONIGHT AFTER DARK AS SOON AS IT IS SAFE FOR ME TO COME DOWN I TRUST YOU WILL HAVE EVERYTHING READY ARE YOU COMING DOWN PRECISELY MY BOY A RISK I ADMIT BUT A NECESSARY ONE
AND WHISPERED THE BUSHES MURMURED AND GOSSIPED TO EACH OTHER EVEN THE SUNLIGHT SEEMED TO HUM TO HIM AS IT LAID WARM HANDS ON HIS FACE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SOUND WHICH NOW AND THEN ROSE ABOVE THESE MURMURS
THE INNER EDGE WAS BOUNDED BY A SECOND SCARP A WALL OF RED STONE WITH SPARKLING POINTS OF LIGHT IMBEDDED IN ITS SMOOTH SURFACE DAVID THREW HIMSELF ON THE GRASS AND ROLLED IN IT IT WAS WARM AND SOFT AND SWEET SMELLING
BUT THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD DRIVEN IT COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS MIND OF COURSE THE PHOENIX'S PLAN WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY MODEL PLANE COULD BE SO HE KEPT THE GOLD PIECES TIED UP IN HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND TOOK HIS TEN DOLLARS TO A HARDWARE STORE
WHICH ROSE LIKE A CLIFF ABOVE HIM A SMOOTH BARE WALL OF ROCK THAT HAD HALTED HIS CLIMB HALFWAY UP THE SCARP WAS A DARK HORIZONTAL LINE OF BUSHES SOMETHING LIKE A HEDGE APPARENTLY THERE WAS A LEDGE OR SHELF THERE AND HE DECIDED TO CLIMB UP TO IT BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME
THE GREAT WINGS WERE OUTSTRETCHED DAVID GULPED CLUTCHED THE PHOENIX'S NECK TIGHTLY AND SHUT HIS EYES HE FELT A HOPPING SENSATION THEN A LONG SICKENING DOWNWARD SWOOP THAT SEEMED TO LEAVE HIS STOMACH FAR BEHIND
IT WAS TOO LATE NOW HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE HE COULD CLIMB AS HE GAZED UP MISERABLY AT THE GLOWING SUMMIT HE THOUGHT HE SAW A TINY SPECK SOAR OUT FROM IT IN A BRIEF CIRCLE
AND ONE OF THE PHOENIX'S FEATHERS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OUT DURING THE FALL HE SLIPPED THROUGH A CELLAR WINDOW HID THE EQUIPMENT UNDER A STACK OF OLD BOXES AND RAN NOISILY UP THE STAIRS INTO THE KITCHEN HEY HE SHOUTED THE LIGHTS ARE OUT
FIRST THEY HAD TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF SAPLING SPRINGY AND STRONG THE SAPLING HAD TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE ONE BY THE GOAT TRAIL THE OTHER AT THE FAR END OF THE LEDGE WHEN THEY HAD BEEN CHOSEN DAVID HAD TO SHINNY UP THEM TO LOP OFF THEIR BRANCHES
WHERE IS OUR WIRE AH THERE WE ARE THE PLIERS PLEASE DO YOU NEED ANY HELP UP THERE DAVID ASKED NO EVERYTHING IS COMING ALONG BEAUTIFULLY THANK YOU I SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING FINISHED IN A FLASH TRAILING ONE END OF THE WIRE IN ITS BEAK
THERE IS A HEDGE AT THE BACK OF YOUR HOUSE IS THERE NOT SPLENDID YOU MAY AWAIT ME THERE DAVID SITTING IN THE SHADOW OF THE HEDGE JUMPED WHEN HE HEARD THE PHOENIX'S QUIET GOOD EVENING MY BOY PHOENIX HE WHISPERED HOW DID YOU DO IT
AND A SHOWER OF SPARKS ANOTHER BLUE FLASH BLAZED UP THE LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE AND DOWN THE WHOLE STREET FLICKERED AND WENT OUT IN THE BLACKNESS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH STAGE OF THE PHOENIX'S DESCENT COULD BE HEARD AS CLEARLY AS CANNON SHOTS
AND WHEN THE MEADOW HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THERE WOULD BE A SOMETHING ELSE BEYOND HE WAS A REAL EXPLORER NOW WHEN HE GOT TO THE TOP HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD A LITTLE TOWER OF STONES THE WAY EXPLORERS ALWAYS DO
THE BRANCHES GREW VERY LOW AND THE GROUND WAS FULL OF LUMPS AND KNOBS WHICH DUG INTO HIM WITH EVERY MOVEMENT THERE WERE VINES TOO AND SOME PRICKLY THINGS LIKE THISTLES
TO SCALE THE ROCK FACE ITSELF WAS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER THERE WERE NO HAND OR FOOT HOLDS SO HE TURNED AND MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE GRASS UNTIL HE REACHED THE END OF THE BARE STONE THEN HE STARTED UPWARD AGAIN IT WAS HARD WORK
WE SHALL SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION AT NIGHT OH SAID DAVID HE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A WHILE THEN ASKED BUT SUPPOSE THE SCIENTIST COMES UP ON THE LEDGE DURING THE DAY AND CATCHES YOU ASLEEP AHA THAT IS WHERE THE ROPE AND HATCHET COME IN
THAT IT WAS SILLY TO SHOW OFF AND NOW THE REAL STORY PART OF MY STORY BEGINS HE MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIFES HE MARRIED NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES
FOR A BETTER NOBLER GIRL DOESN'T LIVE SHE IS ALL I WANT FOR MY SON
WHAT WILL YOU DO AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID O MY LADY AND CONTENT OF MY HEART I SHALL CONTINUE TO ENDURE MY FATE AT THE HANDS OF THESE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE QUEENS WHO VEX ME WITH THEIR CONTINUAL QUARRELLING
AND SHE PICKED UP HER COURAGE WITH BOTH WINGS AND SAID O QUEEN BE LOVELY FOR EVER YOU KNOW WHAT MEN FOLK ARE LIKE
AND NOT BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO BE KIND TO THE ANIMALS NOW I AM ASHAMED AND IT SERVES ME RIGHT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS A REALLY TRULY WISE MAN BEST BELOVED AFTER THAT HE NEVER FORGOT
BUT SOME WERE SIMPLY HORRID AND THE HORRID ONES QUARRELLED WITH THE NICE ONES AND MADE THEM HORRID TOO AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL QUARREL WITH SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND THAT WAS HORRID FOR HIM
FOR THAT IS COUNTED A VIRTUE AMONG THE WIVES OF THE BUTTERFLIES THEN UP AND SPOKE AN EGYPTIAN QUEEN THE DAUGHTER OF A PHAROAH AND SHE SAID OUR PALACE CANNOT BE PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS LIKE A LEEK FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE INSECT NO
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD BENT HIS HEAD AND WHISPERED VERY SOFTLY LITTLE MAN YOU KNOW THAT ALL YOUR STAMPING WOULDN'T BEND ONE BLADE OF GRASS
AND THE ABSENT AIR OF ONE ABSORBED IN DEEP THOUGHT SOPHY WACKLES SAID THE SHARP CHILD WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE AS SHE SUCKED HER THUMB JUST PRICKED BY A TOO EAGER PULL AT THE THORNY BRANCHES
BUT NEXT TIME HE BEGINS TO BOAST TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD ASK HIM TO STAMP AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WE KNOW WHAT MEN FOLK ARE LIKE DON'T WE HE'LL BE VERY MUCH ASHAMED AWAY FLEW THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE TO HER HUSBAND
AND SHE HELD OUT HER FINGER AND WHISPERED SOFTLY TO THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE LITTLE WOMAN COME HERE
WHEN HE TURNED IT ONCE AFRITS AND DJINNS CAME OUT OF THE EARTH TO DO WHATEVER HE TOLD THEM WHEN HE TURNED IT TWICE FAIRIES CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY TO DO WHATEVER HE TOLD THEM AND WHEN HE TURNED IT THREE TIMES
TILL THE CAMPHOR TREE SHOOK AT THE BUTTERFLY'S BOAST AND HE HELD OUT HIS FINGER AND SAID LITTLE MAN COME HERE THE BUTTERFLY WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED BUT HE MANAGED TO FLY UP TO THE HAND OF SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND CLUNG THERE FANNING HIMSELF
LOOKED UP INTO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S EYES AND PUT HER HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE JUST LIKE THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID FIRST O MY LORD BECAUSE I LOVED YOU AND SECONDLY O MY LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WOMEN FOLK ARE
NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT IF YOU EVER MEAN TO SHE WILL BE GOING AWAY FOR EVER SOON WHO AND DEMI PULLED A HALF OPENED BUD
I THINK I'LL WRITE HE WAS SLOWLY BEGINNING AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH BOTH WERE TRYING TO STRIKE OUT A NEW AND BRILLIANT IDEA I'VE GOT IT PERFECTLY LOVELY JUST SUIT HER AND YOU TOO BEING A POET CRIED JOSIE WITH A SKIP WHAT IS IT
AND THE STILLNESS OF SUMMER TWILIGHT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP HEARING AND IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FOR THEY WERE TALKING OF JOHN SO NICE OF LUDMILLA TO BRING US ALL BOTTLES OF REAL GERMAN COLOGNE
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WENT OUT FOR PEACE AND QUIET AS USUAL AND AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HE MET BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VERY SORROWFUL BECAUSE SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS SO WORRIED AND SHE SAID TO HIM O MY LORD AND LIGHT OF MY EYES
FROM HERE TO THE WIDE WORLD'S END
MEANING SOON TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT IT NOW SUDDENLY JOSIE AND THE ROSE BUSH SEEMED TO SUGGEST A SPEEDY END TO HIS TENDER PERPLEXITIES AND HE WAS MOVED TO ACCEPT HER AID AS THE NETTED LION DID THAT OF THE MOUSE
AND SHOWED THAT IT SUITED HIM BY SAYING BLANDLY INSTEAD OF SNUBBING HER AS USUAL YOU ARE VERY KIND CHILD SINCE YOU ARE SO WISE COULD YOU GIVE ME A HINT HOW I'D BETTER SPEAK UP AS YOU ELEGANTLY EXPRESS IT OH WELL THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS YOU KNOW
AND MADE ME ASHAMED BEFORE ALL THE ANIMALS IN ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE I SHOWED OFF NOW IF I SHOWED OFF BEFORE THESE QUEENS OF PERSIA AND EGYPT AND ABYSSINIA AND CHINA MERELY BECAUSE THEY WORRY ME I MIGHT BE MADE EVEN MORE ASHAMED THAN I HAVE BEEN
THEN THEY WENT UP TO THE PALACE AND LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS
LITTLE BUT I THINK HIS FIRST INVESTMENT A SAFE AND GOOD ONE FOR HE WHO GIVETH TO THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD AND I WAS SO PLEASED AND PROUD I WOULDN'T SPOIL IT BY OFFERING HIM A PENNY
AND WAS WILLING TO WORK AND WAIT WITH AND FOR MY JOHN SO SHE WILL BE AND I HOPE THEY WILL FIND IT OUT BUT SHE IS SO DUTIFUL AND GOOD I'M AFRAID SHE WON'T LET HERSELF BE HAPPY YOU WOULD LIKE IT MOTHER HEARTILY
WHEN UPON A SUDDEN THE PALACE DISAPPEARED AND WE WERE LEFT SITTING IN A THICK AND NOISOME DARKNESS AND IT THUNDERED AND DJINNS AND AFRITS MOVED ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS THAT IS OUR TROUBLE O HEAD QUEEN
AND THE ORANGES ARE JUST RIPENING HE ASKED ME NOT TO STAMP AND I PROMISED I WOULDN'T GRACIOUS SAID HIS WIFE AND SAT QUITE QUIET BUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS FACE AT THE IMPUDENCE OF THE BAD LITTLE BUTTERFLY
LIVE FOR EVER I AM THE SMALLEST OF THIRTY THOUSAND BROTHERS AND OUR HOME IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WE HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOING TO FEED ALL THE ANIMALS IN ALL THE WORLD AND MY BROTHERS SENT ME TO ASK WHEN DINNER WOULD BE READY
AND I GUESS WHY THE KIND BOY THINKS IT WOULD MAKE ME UNHAPPY IT WOULDN'T BUT I KNOW HIS WAYS SO I WAIT AND HOPE ALL WILL GO WELL WITH HIM IT MUST NO GIRL IN HER SENSES WOULD REFUSE OUR JOHN
SHE WILL NEVER LAUGH AT YOU AGAIN AND HE TURNED THE RING ON HIS FINGER JUST FOR THE LITTLE BUTTERFLY'S SAKE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF SHOWING OFF AND LO AND BEHOLD FOUR HUGE DJINNS CAME OUT OF THE EARTH SLAVES SAID SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
THEY CAME DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND BENEATH HIS CAMPHOR TREE STILL WEAK WITH LAUGHING THEY SAW THE MOST WISE KING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
AS YOU WOULD TALK TO A FRIEND THERE WAS NEVER A KING LIKE SOLOMON NOT SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN BUT SOLOMON TALKED TO A BUTTERFLY AS A MAN WOULD TALK TO A MAN
AND LET ME HEAR WHAT YOU SAY BACK FLEW THE BUTTERFLY TO HIS WIFE WHO WAS ALL OF A TWITTER BEHIND A LEAF AND SHE SAID HE HEARD YOU SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD HIMSELF HEARD YOU HEARD ME SAID THE BUTTERFLY OF COURSE HE DID I MEANT HIM TO HEAR ME
WHAT ARE YOU AT HERE MISCHIEF ASKED DEMI WITH AN IRVINGESQUE START AS HE FELT RATHER THAN SAW A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN HIS DAY DREAM GETTING FLOWERS FOR OUR BRIDES
I SAID THAT TO QUIET HER AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID
WHEN THEY BOWED IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND GROANED AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE TREES SAID WHEN THEY RUSTLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING FROM THE BISHOP ON THE BENCH TO THE HYSSOP ON THE WALL
ROSE UP FROM HIS SEAT UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS AND REJOICED AND SAID O MY LADY AND SWEETENER OF MY DAYS KNOW THAT IF I HAD MADE A MAGIC AGAINST MY QUEENS FOR THE SAKE OF PRIDE OR ANGER
NOR THE TEARS AND SMILES AND BLUSHES THAT CAME AND WENT AS SHE READ THE NOTE AND PONDERED WHAT ANSWER SHE SHOULD GIVE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE ONE SHE WISHED TO GIVE BUT DUTY HELD HER BACK
THEN CAME A TERRIBLE NOISE FOR ALL THE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE QUEENS RAN OUT OF THE PALACE SHRIEKING AND SHOUTING AND CALLING FOR THEIR BABIES THEY HURRIED DOWN THE GREAT MARBLE STEPS BELOW THE FOUNTAIN
SUPPOSE YOU STAMP NOW I PROMISED SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD THAT I WOULDN'T SAID THE BUTTERFLY AND I DON'T WANT TO BREAK MY PROMISE IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU DID SAID HIS WIFE
JOSIE RAN INTO THE GARDEN TO GATHER FLOWERS FOR THE BRIDES THE SUDDEN ARRIVAL OF THESE INTERESTING BEINGS HAD QUITE ENCHANTED THE ROMANTIC GIRL AND HER HEAD WAS FULL OF HEROIC RESCUES TENDER ADMIRATION
WHO STOOD APART SMILING FELL FLAT ON THEIR FACES FOR THEY SAID IF THESE THINGS ARE DONE WHEN A BUTTERFLY IS DISPLEASED WITH HIS WIFE WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO US WHO HAVE VEXED OUR KING WITH OUR LOUD SPEAKING AND OPEN QUARRELLING THROUGH MANY DAYS
AND LOOKED AWAY AS IF SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO SEE THE DAWN OF THE GREAT PASSION WHICH WHILE IT LASTS MAKES A YOUNG MAN AS HAPPY AS A GOD DO IT WAS ALL HE SAID AND GATHERED A FULL BLOWN ROSE TO FINISH HIS FLORAL LOVE MESSAGE
DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE ANSWERED JOSIE TO WHOM THE WORD MISCHIEF SUGGESTED HER FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT A BRIDE OR A FLOWER ASKED DEMI CALMLY THOUGH HE EYED THE BLOOMING BUSH AS IF IT HAD A SUDDEN AND UNUSUAL INTEREST FOR HIM
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD MUST BE DEAD AND WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW WAS THE EARTH THUNDERING AND DARKENING AT THE NEWS THEN BALKIS BECKONED THAT BOLD QUEEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER AND SAID TO HER AND TO THE OTHERS COME AND SEE
AS I MADE THAT FEAST FOR ALL THE ANIMALS I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAME BUT BY MEANS OF YOUR WISDOM I MADE THE MAGIC FOR THE SAKE OF A JEST AND FOR THE SAKE OF A LITTLE BUTTERFLY AND BEHOLD
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN EVER AND SAID O ANIMAL YOU HAVE EATEN ALL THE DINNER THAT I MADE READY FOR ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE WORLD AND THE ANIMAL SAID O KING LIVE FOR EVER BUT DO YOU REALLY CALL THAT A DINNER
AND I'LL TIE THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN HER ROOM SHE IS COMING TO DRESS WITH DAISY SO I CAN DO IT NICELY DEMI MUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES ON THE BRIDAL BUSH AND A SMILE CAME OVER HIS FACE SO UNLIKE ANY IT HAD EVER WORN BEFORE THAT JOSIE WAS TOUCHED
GIVE HIM BACK HIS PALACE AND DON'T LET'S HAVE ANY MORE HORRID MAGIC WELL MY DEAR SAID THE BUTTERFLY AS BRAVELY AS HE COULD YOU SEE WHAT YOUR NAGGING HAS LED TO OF COURSE
FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND SAID WHAT IS YOUR TROUBLE O QUEENS THEY STOOD ON THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND SHOUTED WHAT IS OUR TROUBLE WE WERE LIVING PEACEFULLY IN OUR GOLDEN PALACE AS IS OUR CUSTOM
THE VERY GREAT ANGEL AZRAEL OF THE SWORD CAME DRESSED AS A WATER CARRIER AND TOLD HIM THE NEWS OF THE THREE WORLDS ABOVE BELOW AND HERE AND YET SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS NOT PROUD
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS STRONG
THE SUN SHONE ON THE DARK GREEN ORANGE LEAVES THE FOUNTAINS PLAYED AMONG THE PINK EGYPTIAN LILIES THE BIRDS WENT ON SINGING AND THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE LAY ON HER SIDE UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE WAGGLING HER WINGS AND PANTING
A BROTHERLY FEELING OF SYMPATHY HAD KEPT HIM FROM TELLING HER HIS HOPES BECAUSE HER OWN WERE FORBIDDEN HIS MOTHER WAS RATHER JEALOUS OF ANY GIRL HE ADMIRED BUT KNOWING THAT SHE LIKED ALICE HE LOVED ON AND ENJOYED HIS SECRET ALONE
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS PLEASE BEGGED THE BASHFUL LOVER EAGER BUT AFRAID OF THIS SHARP TONGUED BIT OF WOMANHOOD I READ IN ONE OF MISS EDGEWORTH'S STORIES ABOUT A MAN WHO OFFERS THREE ROSES TO HIS LADY A BUD
IT HAS ALSO DELIVERED ME FROM THE VEXATIONS OF MY VEXATIOUS WIVES TELL ME THEREFORE O MY LADY AND HEART OF MY HEART HOW DID YOU COME TO BE SO WISE
SHE LOVED HIM TOO MUCH SHE SAT IN HER ROOMS IN THE GOLDEN PALACE OR WALKED IN THE PALACE GARDEN AND WAS TRULY SORRY FOR HIM OF COURSE IF HE HAD CHOSEN TO TURN HIS RING ON HIS FINGER AND CALL UP THE DJINNS AND THE AFRITS
IT IS NOT THE STORY OF THE GLASS PAVEMENT OR THE RUBY WITH THE CROOKED HOLE OR THE GOLD BARS OF BALKIS IT IS THE STORY OF THE BUTTERFLY THAT STAMPED NOW ATTEND ALL OVER AGAIN AND LISTEN
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS WISE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BEASTS SAID WHAT THE BIRDS SAID WHAT THE FISHES SAID AND WHAT THE INSECTS SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE ROCKS SAID DEEP UNDER THE EARTH
AND THEY HEARD HIM SAY O WIFE OF MY BROTHER IN THE AIR REMEMBER AFTER THIS TO PLEASE YOUR HUSBAND IN ALL THINGS LEST HE BE PROVOKED TO STAMP HIS FOOT YET AGAIN FOR HE HAS SAID THAT HE IS USED TO THIS MAGIC
HE LEANED BACK ALL WEAK AND HICCOUGHY AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID O GREAT WIZARD WHAT IS THE SENSE OF RETURNING TO ME MY PALACE IF AT THE SAME TIME YOU SLAY ME WITH MIRTH
BECAUSE I HOPED THAT FOR THE SAKE OF THE JEST MY LORD WOULD MAKE SOME GREAT MAGIC AND THAT THE QUEENS WOULD SEE IT AND BE FRIGHTENED AND SHE TOLD HIM WHAT THE QUEENS HAD SAID AND SEEN AND THOUGHT THEN SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
BUT HE FORGETS THAT LOVE IS EVERYTHING I KNOW HE'S RICH IN THAT I SEE AND FEEL IT AND ANY WOMAN SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET IT RIGHT DEAR I FELT JUST SO
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE STORIES ABOUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM IT IS NOT THE STORY OF THE LAPWING WHO FOUND THE WATER
AND WE ARE MOST EXTREMELY TROUBLED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT TROUBLE FOR IT WAS A TROUBLESOME TROUBLE UNLIKE ANY TROUBLE WE HAVE KNOWN
YES I KNOW LITTLE BROTHER
FOR AT HOME THERE WAS AN INVALID MOTHER AND AN OLD FATHER SHE WAS NEEDED THERE WITH ALL THE HELP SHE COULD NOW BRING BY THE ACQUIREMENTS FOUR YEARS OF FAITHFUL STUDY HAD GIVEN HER LOVE LOOKED VERY SWEET AND A HOME OF HER OWN WITH JOHN A LITTLE HEAVEN ON EARTH
HE VERY SELDOM SHOWED OFF AND WHEN HE DID HE WAS SORRY FOR IT ONCE HE TRIED TO FEED ALL THE ANIMALS IN ALL THE WORLD IN ONE DAY BUT WHEN THE FOOD WAS READY AN ANIMAL CAME OUT OF THE DEEP SEA AND ATE IT UP IN THREE MOUTHFULS
THEN THEY PUT THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR HEADS AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY TIPTOED BACK TO THE PALACE MOST MOUSY QUIET
IT IS NOTHING O QUEENS A BUTTERFLY HAS MADE COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS WIFE BECAUSE SHE QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND IT HAS PLEASED OUR LORD SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD TO TEACH HER A LESSON IN LOW SPEAKING AND HUMBLENESS
AND THEY ALL LIVED IN A GREAT GOLDEN PALACE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOVELY GARDEN WITH FOUNTAINS HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE WIVES BUT IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY MARRIED EVER SO MANY WIVES
AND THEN SHE RAN AWAY TO DO HER GENTLE SPIRITING LIKE ARIEL LEAVING DEMI TO DREAM AMONG THE ROSES LIKE FERDINAND MARY AND LUDMILLA WERE CHARMED WITH THEIR BOUQUETS AND THE GIVER HAD THE DELIGHT OF PUTTING SOME OF THE FLOWERS INTO THE DARK HAIR
IF EVEN THE LITTLE BUD MIGHT BE WORN IT LOOKED VERY POOR AND PALE BESIDE THE OTHERS YET BEING IN THE SELF SACRIFICING MOOD WHICH REAL LOVE BRINGS SHE FELT THAT EVEN A SMALL HOPE WAS TOO MUCH TO GIVE IF SHE COULD NOT FOLLOW IT UP WITH MORE
I DON'T WONDER HE WAS PLEASED AND PROUD I SPOILT MY GLOVES CLAPPING AND QUITE FORGOT MY DISLIKE OF SEEING WOMEN ON PLATFORMS SHE WAS SO EARNEST AND UNCONSCIOUS AND SWEET AFTER THE FIRST MOMENT HAS HE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU DEAR NO
AND THE LIGHT AS SHE PLAYED MAID AT THE TOILETTES OF OUR BRIDES WHICH CONSOLED HER FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MATTER OF VEILS NO ONE HELPED ALICE DRESS FOR DAISY WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM WITH HER MOTHER
AND THE ORATION TODAY HAD FILLED HIM WITH TENDER PRIDE BUT THE SIGHT OF THOSE BLOOMING BRIDES AND BEAMING GROOMS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE PANTED TO SECURE HIS ALICE WITHOUT AN HOUR'S DELAY DAISY WAS HIS CONFIDANTE IN ALL THINGS BUT THIS
O MY LADY AND JEWEL OF MY FELICITY WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN FOR I HAVE BEEN JESTING WITH A BUTTERFLY EVER SINCE I CAME INTO THE GARDEN
BOTH YOU GET THE ONE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER WISH I COULD AND DEMI PICKED A LITTLE BUD WITH A SIGH THAT WENT TO JOSIE'S WARM HEART WHY DON'T YOU THEN IT'S LOVELY TO SEE PEOPLE SO HAPPY
AND HE IS MOST EMINENTLY A GREAT MAGICIAN ONE WHO STEALS AWAY THE VERY PALACE OF SULEIRNAN BIN DAOUD HIMSELF GO IN PEACE LITTLE FOLK AND HE KISSED THEM ON THE WINGS AND THEY FLEW AWAY
FOR SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER OWN EMOTIONS HAPPY ONES NOW TO JUDGE FROM THE SMILE THAT SHONE IN HER EYES AND THE DECIDED GESTURE WITH WHICH SHE PUT THE LITTLE BUD IN HER BOSOM AS IF SHE SAID HE DESERVES SOME REWARD FOR THAT GOOD DEED
AND SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS SOFTLY AND SAID AT LAST SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WILL DO FOR THE SAKE OF A BUTTERFLY WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE LONG AGO FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND THE QUARRELSOME QUEENS WILL BE FRIGHTENED
AND SHE WOULD DO HER DUTY BETTER PERHAPS IF NO IMPATIENT LOVER WAITED FOR HER WITH EYES THAT SAW BUT DIMLY AND A HAND THAT LINGERED ON THE STEM HE HAD STRIPPED OF THORNS SHE LAID THE HALF BLOWN FLOWER BY THE ROSE AND ASKED HERSELF
DAISY I'VE BEEN LONGING TO TELL YOU WHAT HE DID WITH HIS MONEY HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT AND I'VE HAD NO TIME SINCE TO TELL YOU HE SENT POOR YOUNG BARTON TO THE HOSPITAL AND KEPT HIM THERE TILL HIS EYES WERE SAVED A COSTLY THING TO DO
HE WAS IN DESPAIR SICK AND POOR AND TOO PROUD TO BEG AND OUR DEAR BOY FOUND IT OUT AND TOOK EVERY PENNY HE HAD AND NEVER TOLD EVEN HIS MOTHER TILL SHE MADE HIM ALICE DID NOT HEAR WHAT DAISY ANSWERED
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S VERY BEST BELOVED
AMONG THE RED LILIES AND SMILED TO HERSELF FOR SHE HAD HEARD ALL THIS TALK SHE THOUGHT IF I AM WISE I CAN YET SAVE MY LORD FROM THE PERSECUTIONS OF THESE QUARRELSOME QUEENS
I'M USED TO THIS KIND OF THING BUT AS A FAVOUR TO YOU AND TO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD I DON'T MIND PUTTING THINGS RIGHT SO HE STAMPED ONCE MORE AND THAT INSTANT THE DJINNS LET DOWN THE PALACE AND THE GARDENS WITHOUT EVEN A BUMP
AND ASKED HIS LITTLE SISTER TO TEACH HIM HOW TO PUT THE QUESTION WHICH A SINGLE WORD CAN ANSWER THE ARRIVAL OF HIS HAPPY COUSINS HAD SCATTERED ALL HIS WISE PLANS AND BRAVE RESOLUTIONS TO WAIT STILL LONGER THE CHRISTMAS PLAY HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO HOPE
AND THE RIVERS OF THE GOLD OF THE SOUTH FROM THE DESERT OF ZINN TO THE TOWERS OF ZIMBABWE
ALL SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S PALACE AND THIS GARDEN HERE WOULD IMMEDIATELY VANISH IN A CLAP OF THUNDER
BUT BALKIS HID AMONG THE TALL IRISES AND THE SPOTTED BAMBOOS AND THE RED LILLIES BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE
O MY LORD AND REGENT OF MY EXISTENCE I HID BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAW IT ALL IT WAS I WHO TOLD THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE TO ASK THE BUTTERFLY TO STAMP
WHEN HE STAMPS AGAIN YOU WILL BRING THEM BACK CAREFULLY NOW LITTLE BROTHER HE SAID
WHERE I COME FROM WE EACH EAT TWICE AS MUCH AS THAT BETWEEN MEALS THEN SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE AND SAID O ANIMAL I GAVE THAT DINNER TO SHOW WHAT A GREAT AND RICH KING I WAS
I DARE YOU TO DO IT SHE SAID STAMP STAMP STAMP SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SITTING UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE HEARD EVERY WORD OF THIS AND HE LAUGHED AS HE HAD NEVER LAUGHED IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
IF YOU WANT TO BE GAY AND EASY OR YOU COULD WRITE A POETICAL POP YOU'VE TRIED IT I DARE SAY BUT SERIOUSLY JO I DO LOVE ALICE AND I THINK SHE KNOWS IT I WANT TO TELL HER SO BUT I LOSE MY HEAD WHEN I TRY
AS SHE SAT LOOKING SADLY DOWN ON THE SYMBOLS OF AN AFFECTION THAT GREW DEARER EVERY MOMENT SHE LISTENED HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE MURMUR OF VOICES IN THE ADJOINING ROOM OPEN WINDOWS THIN PARTITIONS
THAT IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE HE FOUND BREATH ENOUGH TO WHISPER TO THE BUTTERFLY STAMP AGAIN LITTLE BROTHER GIVE ME BACK MY PALACE MOST GREAT MAGICIAN YES GIVE HIM BACK HIS PALACE SAID THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE STILL FLYING ABOUT IN THE DARK LIKE A MOTH
WHILE DEMI WROTE UPON A CARD DEAR ALICE YOU KNOW WHAT THE FLOWERS MEAN WILL YOU WEAR ONE OR ALL TONIGHT AND MAKE ME STILL PROUDER FONDER AND HAPPIER THAN I AM YOURS ENTIRELY JOHN
AND HE SHALL HAVE IT MISSUS MEG WAS SPEAKING AND STILL OF JOHN WHEN SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT UNWISE AND RECKLESS
THE DJINNS JERKED THE PALACE AND THE GARDENS A THOUSAND MILES INTO THE AIR
LITTLE WOMAN DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOUR HUSBAND HAS JUST SAID
OWN FACE WHICH SIGN OF CONFUSION DELIGHTED LITTLE JO DON'T BE A HYPOCRITE YOU KNOW I MEAN ALICE NOW JACK I'M FOND OF YOU AND WANT TO HELP IT'S SO INTERESTING ALL THESE LOVERS AND WEDDINGS AND THINGS
FOR WE HAVE TAUGHT THE QUEENS OF EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA AND ABYSSINIA AND PERSIA AND INDIA AND CHINA WITH A GREAT AND A MEMORABLE TEACHING AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD STILL LOOKING AFTER THE BUTTERFLIES WHERE THEY PLAYED IN THE SUNLIGHT SAID
AND OF COURSE THE KING HAD TO MARRY EVER SO MANY MORE JUST TO SHOW
OH I'LL BE GOOD I'M SO SORRY I SPOKE ONLY BRING THE GARDENS BACK MY DEAR DARLING HUSBAND AND I'LL NEVER CONTRADICT AGAIN THE BUTTERFLY WAS NEARLY AS FRIGHTENED AS HIS WIFE AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD LAUGHED SO MUCH
JUST WHAT WE NEED AFTER THIS TIRING DAY BE SURE JOHN HAS HIS HE LIKES IT SO YES MOTHER DID YOU SEE HIM JUMP UP WHEN ALICE ENDED HER ORATION HE'D HAVE GONE TO HER IF I HADN'T HELD HIM BACK
IN PLAYS THE LOVERS GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES BUT THAT'S AWKWARD WHEN THEY HAVE LONG LEGS TED NEVER DOES IT WELL THOUGH I DRILL HIM FOR HOURS YOU COULD SAY BE MINE BE MINE LIKE THE OLD MAN WHO THREW CUCUMBERS OVER THE WALL TO MISSUS NICKLEBY
SO HE WENT ON BETWEEN THE LILIES AND THE LOQUATS AND THE ROSES AND THE CANNAS AND THE HEAVY SCENTED GINGER PLANTS THAT GREW IN THE GARDEN TILL HE CAME TO THE GREAT CAMPHOR TREE THAT WAS CALLED THE CAMPHOR TREE OF SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
CHARMED TO HAVE A FINGER IN THIS ROMANTIC PIE JOSIE TIED A GRACEFUL BOW OF RIBBON ABOUT THE STEMS
AND LAY ON THE TOILETTE TABLES OF THE NEW COUSINS AS A DELICATE ATTENTION A STEP STARTLED HER AND LOOKING UP SHE SAW HER BROTHER COMING DOWN THE PATH WITH FOLDED ARMS BENT HEAD
TO BIND HIM BY ANY PROMISE OR EVEN TO PUT INTO WORDS THE LOVE AND HONOUR SHE FELT FOR HIM NO IT WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE ALONE AND SPARE HIM THE PAIN OF HOPE DEFERRED HE WAS YOUNG HE WOULD FORGET
SHE WANTS TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN O SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO IT AND NOW SHE'LL NEVER BELIEVE A WORD I SAY SHE'LL LAUGH AT ME TO THE END OF MY DAYS NO LITTLE BROTHER SAID SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD PRESENTLY TWO BUTTERFLIES FLEW UNDER THE TREE QUARRELLING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD HEARD ONE SAY TO THE OTHER I WONDER AT YOUR PRESUMPTION IN TALKING LIKE THIS TO ME DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF I STAMPED WITH MY FOOT
IT IS HIS HAVING NOTHING TO OFFER THAT KEEPS HIM SILENT I THINK HE IS SO HONEST
TURN THE RING UPON YOUR FINGER AND SHOW THESE QUEENS OF EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA AND PERSIA AND CHINA THAT YOU ARE THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE KING BUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID O MY LADY AND DELIGHT OF MY LIFE REMEMBER THE ANIMAL THAT CAME OUT OF THE SEA
WHEN THEY QUARRELLED TOO MUCH HE ONLY WALKED BY HIMSELF IN ONE PART OF THE BEAUTIFUL PALACE GARDENS AND WISHED HE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN
DRAMATIC SITUATIONS AND FEMININE WONDER AS TO WHETHER THE LOVELY CREATURES WOULD WEAR THEIR VEILS OR NOT SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE A GREAT BUSH OF WHITE ROSES
A HALF BLOWN AND A FULL BLOWN ROSE I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH SHE TOOK BUT IT'S A PRETTY WAY AND ALICE KNOWS ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE WHEN WE READ IT HERE ARE ALL KINDS YOU'VE GOT THE TWO BUDS PICK THE SWEETEST ROSE YOU CAN FIND
WELL SAID THE BUTTERFLY FANNING HIMSELF MOST IMPORTANTLY BETWEEN YOU AND ME MY DEAR
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE SMILED BECAUSE HER OWN TRUE LOVE WAS SO JOYFUL PRESENTLY THE BUTTERFLY VERY HOT AND PUFFY CAME WHIRLING BACK UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAID TO SULEIMAN SHE WANTS ME TO STAMP
IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
I MIGHT HAVE A GUN MYSELF SOMETIMES DID YOU THINK YOU COULD SCARE ME THE MOUNTAINEER STARED IN GENUINE SURPRISE TWUSN'T NO JOKE HE SAID SHORTLY
GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
AND IT APPEARED AS IF SOME CHEERFUL EVENTFUL UPWARD TENDING CAREER WERE EVEN THEN OPENING TO ME ON THAT SELFSAME MILD STILL APRIL NIGHT
IN A MOMENT I HAD PULLED THE BELL IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WITHIN APPEARED A PASSAGE PAVED ALTERNATELY WITH BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE THE WALLS WERE PAINTED IN IMITATION OF MARBLE ALSO AND AT THE FAR END OPENED A GLASS DOOR
THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THESE MOUNTAINS WANT TO KNOW MY NAME YOU HEERD ME YES THE FISHERMAN TURNED AGAIN AND SAW THE GIANT'S RUGGED FACE STERN AND PALE WITH OPEN ANGER NOW
AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD
HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
HOW DID THAT OLD MAN KNOW HIS NAME AND WOULD THE OLD SAVAGE REALLY HAVE HURT HIM HAD HE NOT FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A WONDER EVIDENTLY SHE HAD MUFFLED HIS LAST NAME ON PURPOSE NOT KNOWING IT HERSELF
SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE
AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE
THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED TO THE FISHERMAN WHO HAD JUST PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW AND TOSSED IT INTO THE RIVER PURTY WELL THANK YOU HE SAID SHORTLY HOW ARE YOU FINE WAS THE NONCHALANT ANSWER
A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
A LARGE LUSTRE PENDENT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING MIRRORS CONSOLES MUSLIN CURTAINS AND A HANDSOME CENTRE TABLE COMPLETED THE INVENTORY OF FURNITURE ALL LOOKED EXTREMELY CLEAN AND GLITTERING
THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
HAVE YOU GOT A FATHER LIKE A FLASH HER WHOLE FACE CHANGED
IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
PERMISSION TO ACCEPT SUCH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT SHOULD IT OFFER HAVING FORMED AN ARTICLE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED ME IT WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED IN THE COURSE OF NEXT DAY
YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
BUT YOU SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING
WITH SUNK DARK EYES UNDER A LARGE SQUARE FOREHEAD COMPLEXION DESTITUTE OF BLOOM OR ATTRACTION SOMETHING YOUNG BUT NOT YOUTHFUL NO OBJECT TO WIN A LADY'S LOVE NO BUTT FOR THE SHAFTS OF CUPID
THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED
LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL
SHE IS SOME STIFF OLD MAID FOR THOUGH THE DAUGHTER OF MADAME REUTER SHE MAY WELL NUMBER UPWARDS OF FORTY WINTERS BESIDES IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF SHE BE BOTH YOUNG AND PRETTY I AM NOT HANDSOME
ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
NO NOT IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHY THE FISHERMAN LOOKED AROUND AND WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY THE FIERCE GAZE OF HIS QUESTIONER STOP THAT PLEASE HE SAID WITH A HUMOUROUS SMILE YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS
I RECKON YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I BE I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE AGAIN THE MOUNTAINEER STARED NO USE GITTIN MAD YOUNG FELLER HE SAID COOLLY I MISTAKEN YE FER SOMEBODY ELSE AN I AXE YER PARDON
THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF
COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE
WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
WHEN YOU GIT THROUGH FISHIN COME UP TO THE HOUSE RIGHT UP THE CREEK THAR AN I'LL GIVE YE A DRAM THANK YOU SAID THE FISHERMAN STIFFLY AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AT THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES HE LOOKED BACK THE STRANGER WAS STILL FISHING
THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
I REMEMBER VERY WELL THAT BEFORE QUITTING MY CHAMBER I HELD A BRIEF DEBATE WITH MYSELF AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD CHANGE MY ORDINARY ATTIRE FOR SOMETHING SMARTER AT LAST I CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF LABOUR DOUBTLESS THOUGHT I
WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID AH
AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
HE HAD NOT MOVED HAND OR FOOT AND HE SAID NOTHING BUT HIS MOUTH WAS SET HARD AND HIS BEWILDERED BLUE EYES HAD A GLINT IN THEM THAT THE MOUNTAINEER DID NOT AT THE MOMENT SEE HE WAS LEANING WITH ONE ARM ON THE MUZZLE OF HIS WINCHESTER HIS FACE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME SUAVE AND SHREWD AND NOW HE LAUGHED AGAIN
AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
WHERE NO ANSWER WHAT'S YOUR NAME LITTLE GIRL AND STILL SHE STARED
AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
AND IT WAS A QUICK AND CUNNING RUSE HE OWED HER SOMETHING FOR THAT WHY DID SHE TRY TO PROTECT HIM WONDERFUL EYES TOO THE LITTLE THING HAD DEEP AND DARK AND HOW THE FLAME DID DART FROM THEM WHEN SHE GOT ANGRY HE SMILED REMEMBERING
HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
AND NO DRESSING CAN MAKE ME SO THEREFORE I'LL GO AS I AM AND OFF I STARTED CURSORILY GLANCING SIDEWAYS AS I PASSED THE TOILET TABLE SURMOUNTED BY A LOOKING GLASS A THIN IRREGULAR FACE I SAW
MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE DUSK I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL
FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
AND THE OLD MAN WENT ON WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD HE'LL COME HE SAID TO HIMSELF OH HE'LL COME THAT VERY POINT HALE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF AS HE UNAVAILINGLY CAST HIS MINNOW INTO THE SWIFT WATER AND SLOWLY WOUND IT IN AGAIN
WAS IT SAGACITY SENSE YES I THOUGHT SO BUT I COULD SCARCELY AS YET BE SURE I DISCOVERED HOWEVER
BUT CALMLY SHE HIT THE HORSE AGAIN AND THE OLD MAN CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER YOU COME ON DOWN TO THE MILL AN I'LL SHOW YE WHAR YOU CAN KETCH A MESS ALL RIGHT SHOUTED HALE HOLDING BACK HIS LAUGHTER AND ON THEY WENT
THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
FOR I AM NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET
PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
AND THE FISHERMAN WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD ARIGHT JUNE THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A SHRILL ANSWERING CRY BUT SHE DID NOT MOVE THAR NOW SHE SAID WHO'S THAT YOUR MAMMY NO TAIN'T
NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
WHO MIGHT INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT IN CURLS
AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHILLING HAD NOT A SECOND LARGE PAIR OF FOLDING DOORS STANDING WIDE OPEN AND DISCLOSING ANOTHER AND SMALLER SALON MORE SNUGLY FURNISHED OFFERED SOME RELIEF TO THE EYE
WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
HIT'S MY STEP MAMMY I'M A GOIN TO KETCH HELL NOW HER INNOCENT EYES TURNED SULLEN AND HER BABY MOUTH TIGHTENED GOOD LORD SAID THE FISHERMAN STARTLED AND THEN HE STOPPED THE WORDS WERE AS INNOCENT ON HER LIPS AS A BENEDICTION
BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF APRIL THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK LONG
THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
YET I WOULD REMIND THEE OF ONE DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THY COURTSHIP IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE OMITTED AND THAT IS NEVER TO GO FORTH UPON THE ENTERPRIZE WHETHER IT BE IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON
IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH SHOULD PUT IT OFF BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING SO ACCORDINGLY IT WAS RESOLV'D UPON FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
THAT WIDOW WADMAN AN PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP CANNOT HOLD IT OUT TEN DAYS AND WHENCE CRIED SLOP JEERINGLY HAST THOU ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE OF WOMAN FRIEND
MY FATHER HAD SUCH A SKIRMISHING CUTTING KIND OF A SLASHING WAY WITH HIM IN HIS DISPUTATIONS THRUSTING AND RIPPING AND GIVING EVERY ONE A STROKE TO REMEMBER HIM BY IN HIS TURN
S'DEATH CRIED MY GREAT GRANDFATHER CLAPPING HIS HAND UPON HIS NOSE
I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
BROTHER DIDIUS TRIBONIUS WILL ANSWER NOW TRIBONIUS THE CIVILIAN AND CHURCH LAWYER'S BEARD BEING THREE INCHES AND A HALF AND THREE EIGHTHS LONGER THAN DIDIUS HIS BEARD
A WHIFF OF MILITARY PRIDE HAD PUFF'D OUT HIS SHIRT AT THE WRIST AND UPON THAT IN A BLACK LEATHER THONG CLIPP'D INTO A TASSEL BEYOND THE KNOT HUNG THE CORPORAL'S STICK MY UNCLE TOBY CARRIED HIS CANE
SHE CANNOT QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HALTING WHEN THEY HAD MARCH'D UP TO WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF MISSUS WADMAN'S DOOR SHE CANNOT CORPORAL TAKE IT AMISS
WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A POPISH CLERGY WOMAN SAID TRIM TWAS A BEGUINE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY DOCTOR SLOP WAS TOO MUCH IN WRATH TO LISTEN TO THE DISTINCTION
FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
MISS PHIPPS FOR HER PART DIDN'T LIKE DRESSING FOR EFFECT SHE HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT STYLE OF APPEARANCE WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO CREATE A SENSATION
AND TO SHORTEN ALL DESCRIPTION THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT AGAINST THE SUN THAT MORNING AND HAD SO METALLICK AND DOUGHTY AN AIR WITH THEM THAT HAD MY UNCLE TOBY THOUGHT OF ATTACKING IN ARMOUR NOTHING COULD HAVE SO WELL IMPOSED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
AND MY FATHER TAKING THAT VERY CRISIS TO FALL IN HELTER SKELTER UPON THE WHOLE ORDER OF NUNS AND BEGUINES A SET OF SILLY FUSTY BAGGAGES SLOP COULD NOT STAND IT AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAVING SOME MEASURES TO TAKE ABOUT HIS BREECHES
INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
WHAT WAS TO BE HAD HOWEVER HE SET THE GREATER STORE BY AND THOUGH MY FATHER WOULD OFT TIMES SPORT WITH MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIBRARY WHICH BY THE BYE WAS RIDICULOUS ENOUGH
DEVOUREDST NO MAN'S BREAD GENTLY WITH FAITHFUL TRIM BEHIND THEE DIDST THOU AMBLE ROUND THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF THY PLEASURES JOSTLING NO CREATURE IN THY WAY FOR EACH ONE'S SORROWS THOU HADST A TEAR
WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
TWOULD HAVE COST HER LADYSHIP A SMILE IT CURL'D EVERY WHERE BUT WHERE THE CORPORAL WOULD HAVE IT AND WHERE A BUCKLE OR TWO IN HIS OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE IT HONOUR HE COULD AS SOON HAVE RAISED THE DEAD
NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM
WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
WHICH HAVING LITTLE OR NO MEANING IN THEM NATURE IS OFT TIMES OBLIGED TO FIND ONE AND AS FOR MY FATHER'S EXAMPLE TWAS SO FAR FROM BEING EITHER AIDING OR ABETTING THEREUNTO
THEY HAD COST HIM MOREOVER AS MUCH LABOUR IN COOKING AND DIGESTING AS IN THE CASE ABOVE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WELL AND TRULY BE SAID TO BE OF HIS OWN GOODS AND CHATTELS ACCORDINGLY HE HELD FAST BY EM BOTH BY TEETH AND CLAWS
NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
THAT THE SWEAT OF A MAN'S BROWS AND THE EXSUDATIONS OF A MAN'S BRAINS ARE AS MUCH A MAN'S OWN PROPERTY AS THE BREECHES UPON HIS BACKSIDE
THEY ARE ALL BOOKS WHICH EXCITE LAUGHTER AND THOU KNOWEST DEAR TOBY THAT THERE IS NO PASSION SO SERIOUS AS LUST STICK A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF THY SHIRT BEFORE THOU ENTEREST HER PARLOUR
LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
WOULD FLY TO WHATEVER HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AND IN A WORD WOULD INTRENCH AND FORTIFY THEM ROUND WITH AS MANY CIRCUMVALLATIONS AND BREAST WORKS AS MY UNCLE TOBY WOULD A CITADEL
HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
AND NO OBSTACLE IN NATURE TO FORBID THE MUSIC STRIKING UP THIS VERY NIGHT YET WILL I ANSWER FOR IT THAT THIS SELF SAME TUNE WILL NOT BE PLAY'D THIS TWELVEMONTH
A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
AND PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL FOR THEE THO NOT SO WELL FOR ME THAT THOU HAST OCCASION FOR A LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS UPON THAT HEAD AND THAT I AM ABLE TO WRITE IT TO THEE HAD IT BEEN THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIM WHO DISPOSES OF OUR LOTS
THAT WIDOW WADMAN HAS BEEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER TOBY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS USED EVERY ART AND CIRCUMVENTION OF WOMAN TO OUTWIT HIM INTO THE SAME PASSION YET NOW THAT SHE HAS CAUGHT HIM HER FEVER WILL BE PASS'D ITS HEIGHT
BY THE TROTTING OF MY LEAN HORSE THE THING IS INCREDIBLE AND I AM QUITE LOST IN MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I AM CONSIDERING WHAT A TREASURE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND TALENTS TOGETHER HAS BEEN WASTED UPON WORSE SUBJECTS
OR WHEN HE CHEW'D IT OR WHEN HE ROASTED IT OR WHEN HE PEEL'D OR WHEN HE BROUGHT IT HOME OR WHEN HE DIGESTED OR WHEN HE FOR TIS PLAIN SIR IF THE FIRST PICKING UP OF THE APPLE MADE IT NOT HIS THAT NO SUBSEQUENT ACT COULD
AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
MISSUS SHANDY BEING NOW CLOSE BESIDE ME PREPARING FOR BED I HAVE THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER AND JUST AS THEY HAVE COME INTO MY MIND SUCH HINTS AND DOCUMENTS AS I DEEM MAY BE OF USE TO THEE
THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
WHEN ONCE A POOR CREATURE IS IN HE IS IN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR FOR EVER TIS VERY TRUE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING GRAVELY AT MISSUS WADMAN'S HOUSE AS HE SPOKE NOTHING
THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
WHOM HE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE PAS DE BAS AND THE LANCERS QUADRILLES SHE HAD HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY MATRIMONY WITH CZERLASKI WHO HAD TAKEN HER TO PARIS AND GERMANY
FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
FOR THIS CAUSE IF THOU CANST HELP IT NEVER THROW DOWN THE TONGS AND POKER AVOID ALL KINDS OF PLEASANTRY AND FACETIOUSNESS IN THY DISCOURSE WITH HER
SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
INSERTED HIS HAND CAUTIOUSLY BETWIXT HIS HEAD AND THE CAWL OF HIS WIG LOOK'D AT BOTH SIDES OF EVERY GUINEA AS HE PARTED WITH IT AND SELDOM COULD GET TO THE END OF THE FIFTY POUNDS WITHOUT PULLING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPING HIS TEMPLES
THOUGH I PERCEIVE FROM A GLOW IN MY CHEEK THAT I BLUSH AS I BEGIN TO SPEAK TO THEE UPON THE SUBJECT AS WELL KNOWING NOTWITHSTANDING THY UNAFFECTED SECRECY HOW FEW OF ITS OFFICES THOU NEGLECTEST
BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
THEY ARE AS ROTTEN AS DIRT SAID THE CORPORAL THEN BY ALL MEANS SAID MY FATHER BESPEAK A NEW PAIR BROTHER FOR THOUGH I KNOW CONTINUED MY FATHER TURNING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY
BY THE WAY IF YOU WOULD KNOW THE STRANGE WAY OF GETTING A KIN AMONGST SO FLAT NOSED A PEOPLE YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIND IT OUT YOURSELF YOU NEVER CAN
AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
COULD HAVE VENTED SUCH AN INSINUATION HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AND AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION SO THAT HE HAD SCARCE GOT TO THE LAST WORD OF THIS UNGRACIOUS RETORT
SO THAT THE WHIMSICALITY OF MY FATHER'S BRAIN WAS FAR FROM HAVING THE WHOLE HONOUR OF THIS AS IT HAD OF ALMOST ALL HIS OTHER STRANGE NOTIONS FOR IN A GREAT MEASURE HE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SUCK'D THIS IN WITH HIS MOTHER'S MILK
AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
NOW TRIM'S MONTERO CAP AS I ONCE TOLD YOU WAS HIS CONSTANT WAGER AND HAVING FURBISH'D IT UP THAT VERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO GO UPON THE ATTACK IT MADE THE ODDS LOOK MORE CONSIDERABLE
ONCE AT LEAST EVERY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BUT OFTNER IF CONVENIENT LEST IN TAKING OFF THY WIG BEFORE HER THRO ABSENCE OF MIND SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH HAS BEEN CUT AWAY BY TIME HOW MUCH BY TRIM
SO THAT MY FATHER HAD THE JOINTURE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS HALF YEARLY ON MICHAELMAS AND LADY DAY DURING ALL THAT TIME NO MAN DISCHARGED PECUNIARY OBLIGATIONS WITH A BETTER GRACE THAN MY FATHER
AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
I WOULD LAY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR MY MONTERO CAP TO A SHILLING WAS IT PROPER CONTINUED TRIM MAKING A BOW TO OFFER A WAGER BEFORE YOUR HONOURS THERE IS NOTHING IMPROPER IN IT SAID MY FATHER
WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
FOR EACH MAN'S NEED THOU HADST A SHILLING WHILST I AM WORTH ONE TO PAY A WEEDER THY PATH FROM THY DOOR TO THY BOWLING GREEN SHALL NEVER BE GROWN UP
THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
AND FEEL PITY FOR THE FORCE OF EDUCATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF OPINIONS LONG DERIVED FROM ANCESTORS FOR THREE GENERATIONS AT LEAST THIS TENET IN FAVOUR OF LONG NOSES
THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
FOR THAT THE TAYLOR IN RIPPING THEM UP IN ORDER TO TURN THEM HAD FOUND THEY HAD BEEN TURN'D BEFORE THEN TURN THEM AGAIN BROTHER SAID MY FATHER RAPIDLY FOR THERE WILL BE MANY A TURNING OF EM YET BEFORE ALL'S DONE IN THE AFFAIR
DID HE READ SUCH BOOKS AND OBSERVE SUCH FACTS AND THINK SUCH THOUGHTS AS WOULD ETERNALLY BE MAKING HIM CHANGE SIDES NOW MY FATHER AS I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR DETESTED ALL THIS HE PICK'D UP AN OPINION SIR
BUT NOT VAPOURINGLY AND WITH THE SWEETEST ACCENT OF MOST RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGEMENT BID HIS HONOUR NEVER FEAR NOW MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEAR AND GRIEVOUSLY TOO
WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM MY MOTHER WAS THEN CONJUGALLY SWINGING WITH HER LEFT ARM TWISTED UNDER HIS RIGHT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE INSIDE OF HER HAND RESTED UPON THE BACK OF HIS
A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
OF THE SMALLEST DESCRIPTION INDEED HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO CALL IT HIS OWN HE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY RECALCITRANT NOW AND THEN AS IS THE HABIT OF LONG EARED PACHYDERMS UNDER THE THONG OF THE FAIR COUNTESS'S TONGUE
AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTER'D UPON THE ODD FIFTY HE GENERALLY GAVE A LOUD HEM
THAT IF TOM HAD NOT MARRIED THE WIDOW OR HAD IT PLEASED GOD AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD BUT PUT PORK INTO THEIR SAUSAGES THE HONEST SOUL HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND DRAGG'D TO THE INQUISITION
INFINITE WAS HIS PITY NOR WOULD THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF ROMANCE HAVE GONE FURTHER AT LEAST UPON ONE LEG TO HAVE WIPED AWAY A TEAR FROM A WOMAN'S EYE
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE SO VERY DETESTABLE IT IS TRUE THE COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE VAIN A LITTLE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE SELFISH A LITTLE SHALLOW AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE GIVEN TO WHITE LIES BUT
NOW MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S NOSE WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE UNTO THE NOSES OF ALL THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM PANTAGRUEL FOUND DWELLING UPON THE ISLAND OF ENNASIN
THAT HE DID NOT CONCEIVE HOW THE GREATEST FAMILY IN ENGLAND COULD STAND IT OUT AGAINST AN UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION OF SIX OR SEVEN SHORT NOSES AND FOR THE CONTRARY REASON HE WOULD GENERALLY ADD
CONSCIENCE REDOUBLED HER BLOW HE TURN'D HIS FACE SUDDENLY THE OTHER WAY AND MY MOTHER SUPPOSING HIS BODY WAS ABOUT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER TO MOVE HOMEWARDS BY A CROSS MOVEMENT OF HER RIGHT LEG
MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
CHAPTER FOUR I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MILBY HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AS BAD AS THEY IMAGINED
MURMURING SOUND IT WAS NEITHER SAD NOR GLAD SOMETHING LIKE THE SOUND THAT THE LAST BEE OF AUTUMN MAKES
SHE RESOLVED TO ASK HIM AND IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM COMING THROUGH THE WOOD SHE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND BEGGED HIM TO TELL HER HIS NAME THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED VERY PLEASED TO SEE HER
THE WOUNDED LION CUENTOS POPULARS CATALANS THERE WAS ONCE A GIRL SO POOR THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO LIVE ON AND WANDERED ABOUT THE WORLD ASKING FOR CHARITY ONE DAY
AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF THE KING'S PALACE AND ASK THE PRINCESS TO TAKE ME AS A SERVANT SO THEY PARTED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE CITY SHE WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT BUT
AND ALL THE WHILE HE WAS LYING UPON HIS BELLY HIS FACE THRUST INTO A PILLOW
AND WHEN THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCESS SAW THE YOUNG MAN A GREAT JOY FILLED THEIR HEARTS FOR THEY KNEW HIM FOR THE ELDEST SON WHO HAD LONG AGO BEEN ENCHANTED BY A GIANT AND LOST TO THEM
FROM WHAT ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER HAVE LET FALL HE EXCLAIMED I HAVE CONTRIVED TO LEARN THAT HE IS IN THE PALACE OF THE KING WHO KEEPS HIM HIDDEN LEST ANYONE SHOULD SEE HIM AND THAT TO MORROW HE IS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS
AND AS GLAD TO LOOK UPON AS THE SUN HIMSELF THEN THE YOUNG MAN THANKED THE MAIDEN FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM AND SAID SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND NONE OTHER BUT THE MAIDEN ONLY WEPT SORE
SO CHEERFULLY THAT HE ALMOST EXPECTED THEM TO WRITE OUT A BILL FOR SURGICAL FEES GOD THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE
CLOSE BEHIND IT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THAT DUST CLOUD ON ANY MAP IT MUST BE FAR FAR AWAY NEA LAUGHED AGAIN WHAT IS FAR WHAT IS NEAR
AND THE MAIDEN SAID YES SHE WOULD AND SO THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY THE OLD DAME WHO LOOKED AFTER THE HOUSE HANDED HER ALL THE KEYS BUT POINTED HER OUT ONE THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL NEVER TO USE FOR IF SHE DID
AND ASKED IF SHE WOULD NOT STAY AND SIT BY HIM BUT THE GIRL SAID SHE HAD HER PIGS TO WATCH AND SHE MUST GO AND SEE AFTER THEM
SO THAT THE TAILORS MIGHT TAKE THE DRESS TO PIECES AND MAKE IT FIT BUT BY THIS TIME THE MAIDEN HAD ARRIVED FOOTSORE AND WEARY AT THE CASTLE
AND CUT OFF THE LOCK AND WOVE IT INTO A COAT THAT GLITTERED LIKE SILK AND BROUGHT IT TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HER TO CARRY IT STRAIGHT TO THE GIANT BUT THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL TO CRY OUT A LONG WAY OFF WHAT SHE HAD WITH HER OR ELSE HE WOULD SPRING UPON HER AND RUN HER THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD
BUT THE LOCK WAS STIFF AND RESISTED ALL HER EFFORTS AND IN THE END SHE HAD TO BREAK IT AND WHAT WAS INSIDE AFTER ALL
SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT COULD BE IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS OPENED BY THE KEY AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IF WE ONCE BEGIN TO THINK WE SOON BEGIN TO DO AND IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE KEY WAS NO LONGER IN THE MAIDEN'S HAND
BUT THEN JUST AS THE STRANGE SOOTHING FEELING WAS PUTTING HIM BACK TO SLEEP THE HAIRS CHANGED THEIR SOFT CARESS AND A DOZEN OF THEM PLUNGED INTO HIS SPINAL CORD
AND WALKED TILL SHE REACHED THE GOLDEN CASTLE WHERE LIVED THE SUN AND SHE KNOCKED BOLDLY AT THE DOOR SAYING ALL HAIL O SUN I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED
AND SHONE LIKE THE SUN AND THE GIRL COMBED IT AND COMBED IT TILL IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN EVER AND THE PRINCESS WAS PLEASED AND BADE HER COME EVERY DAY AND COMB HER HAIR TILL AT LENGTH THE GIRL TOOK COURAGE AND BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ONE OF THE LONG THICK LOCKS
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WAS TO GET A LOCK OF HAIR FROM THE HEAD OF A KING'S DAUGHTER TO SPIN IT AND TO MAKE FROM IT A CLOAK FOR THE GIANT WHO LIVED UP ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN VERY WELL ANSWERED THE GIRL I WILL GO TO THE CITY
AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT THEY WILL BE RIGHT BUT LIVING THINGS AND LIVING EMOTIONS DEMAND SOMETHING TO CLING TO A MEASURING STICK GRIM HAGEN TRIED TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL BACK THERE
SHE ARRIVED AT A THATCHED COTTAGE AND INQUIRED IF THEY COULD GIVE HER ANY WORK THE FARMER SAID HE WANTED A COWHERD AS HIS OWN HAD LEFT HIM AND IF THE GIRL LIKED THE PLACE SHE MIGHT TAKE IT SO SHE BECAME A COWHERD
WHO LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND YOU CAN GUESS HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS BUT THE LION SEEMED IN SUCH PAIN THAT SHE WAS SORRY FOR HIM AND DREW NEARER AND NEARER TILL SHE SAW HE HAD A LARGE THORN IN ONE FOOT
THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD WED HER AND HER ONLY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED IF IT IS THE PRINCESS WE MUST GO QUICKLY COME WITH ME SO THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE KING'S PALACE
AND WEEPING SHE JOINED THE PRINCE WHO WAS AWAITING HER AT THE BOTTOM AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD HER STORY HE COMFORTED HER AND BADE HER BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND TO DO THE BIDDING OF THE GIANT AND THE MAIDEN BELIEVED WHAT THE PRINCE TOLD HER
AND SAID HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE SHE WHO HAD SECRETLY KEPT HIS HOUSE FOR SO MANY DAYS AND HE ADDED THAT HE WAS A PRINCE ENCHANTED BY A POWERFUL GIANT BUT WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE HIS OWN SHAPE AT NIGHT FOR ALL DAY HE WAS FORCED TO APPEAR AS THE LION WHOM SHE HAD SO OFTEN HELPED
THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT THAT AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING THEN HIS VISION CLEARED
FOR SHE HAD WATCHED HER SLEEPING BOTH IN THE COTTAGE AND IN THE PALACE AND SHE SPAKE TO HER AND SAID DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP THEN THE GIRL TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY AND THE MOON LISTENED
ODIN CORRECTED IF NOT DESTROYED IT HAS A CHANCE TO IMPROVE ITS PERCENTAGE WHEN THE PURSUER HAS MADE ITS PASS TRUE ENOUGH
GUNNAR SAT UP AND BEGAN GRUMBLING ANEW WELL THANKS NOW GET ME SOME CLOTHES
AND HER MISTRESS ANSWERED HER WHERE HE IS NONE CAN TELL BETTER THAN THE SUN THE MOON AND THE WIND FOR THEY GO EVERYWHERE ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE DAMSEL SET FORTH ONCE MORE
AND I AM WEARY FOR I SEEK MY HUSBAND THROUGH THE WIDE WORLD INDEED SPOKE THE SUN DO YOU RICH AS YOU ARE NEED HELP BUT THOUGH YOU LIVE IN A PALACE WITHOUT WINDOWS THE SUN ENTERS EVERYWHERE
HE EVEN THREW IN A GODDESS DID HE SUCCEED SHE PAUSED TO CARESS THE TWO THINGS SHE HELD IN HER ARMS MY PETS KNOW MORE ABOUT TIME AND SPACE AND ENERGY THAN ALL OF YOU DON'T YOU DEARS
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHERE WE ARE GUNNAR DEMANDED GIVE ME TIME LITTLE MAN
DO YOU REMEMBER A STORY ABOUT THE BUSH MEN DYING FROM A CURSE HERE SHE HELD HER TWO PRECIOUS KALIS IN ONE ARM WHILE SHE TAPPED THE BASE OF HER SKULL IN HERE IS A BULB THE OLD BRAIN
TELL HIM NEA
A FEW OF THE BRONS AND MOST OF THE SLAVES REVOLTED THEY WON OF COURSE GRIM HAGEN SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE RESULT HE AND HIS MEN WERE IN FLIGHT WHEN THEY FOUND YOU AND TOOK MAYA
AFTER THAT WE WILL HAVE TO STICK CLOSE BY HIM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ALL WE ARE BEHIND HIM BY THE OLD AIRMEN'S RULE OF THUMB A SHIP WITH ANOTHER UPON ITS TAIL IS A HUNDRED PERCENT LOSS ONLY AT THAT MOMENT
YOU DO NOT EVEN HAVE CATCH WORDS FOR TRANS SPACE YOU ARE LOOKING INTO THE BOOKS OF THE ADVANCED CLASSES AND YOU HAVE NOT YET OPENED THE PRIMERS OF SPACE
TILL SHE CAME TO ANOTHER CASTLE AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND SAID ALL HAIL I HAVE COME TO ASK IF OF YOUR CHARITY YOU WILL HELP ME IN MY NEED IT IS MY LORD THE WIND THAT YOU WANT
AND FOR A SECOND SHE LOOKED LIKE A HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE AMAZON HOLDING TWO MUMMIFIED HEADS BEFORE HER THE PAIN LEFT HIM HIS MIND CLEARED AND HE LAY THERE GASPING FROM THE ORDEAL
SO THE MAIDEN DEPARTED AND CLIMBED UP THE MOUNTAIN BUT BEFORE SHE REACHED THE TOP THE GIANT HEARD HER FOOTSTEPS AND RUSHED OUT BREATHING FIRE AND FLAME HAVING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND A CLUB IN THE OTHER
NEA I WAS MY FATHER'S HELPER FOR YEARS AND YEARS I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT SPACE AS ANY MAN SHE SHRUGGED OH YOU CAN COVER BLACKBOARDS WITH FORMULAS
I HAVE A FIX UPON HIM WE SAPPED ALL THE ENERGY FROM ALDEBARAN THAT WE COULD WE HAVE POWER ENOUGH BUT THERE ARE NO STARS NEARBY AS I SAID BEFORE HE IS HEADING FOR A DUST CLOUD THERE BOTH SHIPS CAN REPLENISH THEIR ENERGY
BUT THEY HAD GONE AND THOUGH SHE HUNTED EVERYWHERE SHE NEVER FOUND THEM AND SHE HAD TO RETURN HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO SCOLDED HER BITTERLY AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER THEN HE SAID NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE ASSES
NOT EVEN AN IDIOT'S BRAIN THAT BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE JUNGLE IT IS A SIMPLE WORRYING BRAIN EASILY FRIGHTENED EASILY CONVINCED IT WAS CONVINCED THAT YOU WERE DEAD WE HAD TO AROUSE IT
LEAVING A FLASHING WAKE BEHIND THEM THEY HURTLED THROUGH THE MURKY LIGHT LIKE SHOOTING STARS AND ONCE TWO OF THEM DASHED TOGETHER AND BURST LIKE A ROCKET
TO ASK YOUR HELP IT IS MY MISTRESS THE MOON YOU SEEK I WILL TELL HER OF YOUR PRAYER SO THE MOON CAME OUT AND WHEN SHE SAW THE MAIDEN SHE KNEW HER AGAIN
THE PRINCESS WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER HAIR DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH ANY OF IT SO SHE SAID NO BUT THE GIRL COULD NOT GIVE UP HOPE AND EACH DAY SHE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO CUT OFF JUST ONE TRESS
ONE MORNING SHE WAS DRIVING HER COWS THROUGH THE MEADOWS WHEN SHE HEARD NEAR BY A LOUD GROAN THAT ALMOST SOUNDED HUMAN SHE HASTENED TO THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND FOUND IT PROCEEDED FROM A LION
THE SPARKS CAME FALLING DOWN THROUGH A BILLION MILES OF SPACE AND AS THEY FELL THEY BUILT UP PLANETS AND SYSTEMS OF THEIR OWN UNTIL A DARK COIL THAT HAD THE SHAPE OF A DRAGON SLITHERED ACROSS THE MILKY WAY
AND FOUND HER OLD FRIEND THE LION WOUNDED THROUGH AND THROUGH FAST DYING UNDER A TREE SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM AND WASHED HIS WOUNDS ONE BY ONE AND LAID HEALING HERBS UPON THEM AND THE LION LICKED HER HANDS AND THANKED HER
AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD FIVE HOURS OF IT AND IT WAS TOUCH AND GO ALL THE TIME WHAT HAPPENED ODIN ASKED HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING ABOUT A GLITTERING TOMB
NEXT SHE THOUGHT I WILL NOT STIR FROM HERE TILL I SEE HIM COME OUT AND DISCOVER WHO HE IS ACCORDINGLY SHE WAITED AND AT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING THE ROCK MOVED TO ONE SIDE AND A LION CAME OUT
TRYING TO REASSURE HIM BESIDE ODIN ON ANOTHER BED WAS GUNNAR LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK AND STRIPPED TO THE WAIST GUNNAR WAS HOWLING CURSES AND KICKING LIKE A FROG A DOCTOR AND A NURSE WERE THERE
THE MAIDEN TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD ALREADY FOUND HIM AND SPUN THE LOCK INTO SHINING STUFF
ASK HER IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS MANTLE AND WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THE MANTLE SHE WAS DELIGHTED FOR HER WEDDING MANTLE HAD BEEN SPOILT WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANOTHER SO SHE TOLD THE MAIDEN TO ASK WHAT PRICE SHE WOULD
AND CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THINKING THAT AFTER ALL IT DID NOT MATTER MUCH SO THE MAIDEN WAS LED TO THE ROOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER HUSBAND AND WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE TOUCHED HIM WITH THE SPRIG OF ROSEMARY THAT SHE CARRIED AND HIS MEMORY CAME BACK AND HE KNEW HER
THE PEOPLE WERE BLED WHITE GRAFT CORRUPTION AND PATRONAGE HAD TAKEN ITS TOLL SOME OF THE BRONS WERE OLDER AND WANTED TO REST BUT INJUSTICE COULDN'T STOP UNTIL THE LAST TEAR HAD WASHED AWAY THE LAST DROP OF BLOOD
AND KISSED HER AND DECLARED THAT SHE WAS HIS TRUE WIFE AND THAT HE LOVED HER AND NO OTHER
WHICH THE PRINCESS PAID HER GLADLY SO PLEASED WAS SHE WITH HER NEW POSSESSIONS THEN THE GIRL WENT DOWN THE STEPS WHERE NONE COULD WATCH HER AND CRACKED HER WALNUT AND OUT CAME THE MOST SPLENDID COURT DRESS THAT ANY DRESSMAKER HAD EVER INVENTED
SOMETHING WAS FALLING ACROSS THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND SPREADING OUT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS LIKE A WOMAN'S HAIR HE THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS A BIT COARSER BUT NOT MUCH
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT MUCH USE TO HAVE A LOVELY MANTLE AND ELEGANT PETTICOATS IF SHE HAD NO DRESS AND SHE KNEW THE TAILORS WOULD NEVER BE READY IN TIME SO SHE SENT AT ONCE TO SAY SHE WOULD BUY THE DRESS AND WHAT SUM DID THE MAIDEN WANT FOR IT
THE HANDS HELD HIM SECURELY AND ONCE WHEN HE ALMOST STRUGGLED CLEAR A STRONG KNEE WAS THRUST INTO HIS BACK AND FORCED HIM DOWN AT INTERVALS HE COULD HEAR GUNNAR'S VOICE AND HIS OWN
AND IN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME OUR WILLING AND UNWILLING FUGITIVES WILL HAVE LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE THE VAGARIES OF TIME SPACE AND SPEED UPON THEIR SIDE NEA LAUGHED EVEN AS I SAID BEFORE
BREAKING A SPRIG OF ROSEMARY OFF A BUSH HARD BY SHE RESOLVED COST WHAT IT MIGHT TO SEEK HIM THROUGH THE WORLD TILL SHE FOUND HIM SO SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED AND SHE WALKED TILL SHE ARRIVED AT A HOUSE BUILT OF STRAW AND SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
AND RETURNED QUITE IN DESPAIR TO THE KING'S PALACE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SHE WAS COMBING THE PRINCESS'S HAIR SHE BEGGED LEAVE TO CUT OFF ANOTHER LOCK AT FIRST THE PRINCESS SAID NO BUT THE GIRL BEGGED SO HARD THAT AT LENGTH SHE GAVE IN ON CONDITION
AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A GREAT LORD AND THAT NEVER HAD HE SEEN A MAIDEN SO BEAUTIFUL AS SHE AND THAT
THE HARDER SHE PULLED THE FIRMER SEEMED THE PLANT AND AT LAST DETERMINED NOT TO BE BEATEN SHE GAVE ONE GREAT TUG AND THE ROSEMARY REMAINED IN HER HANDS THEN SHE HEARD A VOICE CLOSE TO HER SAYING WELL
SHE SMILED PROUDLY IT WAS MY INVENTION THAT SAVED YOU YOU SEE I HAVE TWO OF THEM NOW I TOLD YOU
SO EVERY DAY SHE HAD TO TAKE THE ASSES TO THE WOODS TO FEED UNTIL ONE MORNING EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER SHE HAD FOUND THE LION SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE NOISE CAME AND
AND HE KNOWS YOU THEN THE BRIDE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND DID NOT HIDE HER OWN ILL DOING AND THE SUN LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL HER WHERE TO GO HE GAVE HER A NUT
BUT THEY HAD VANISHED AS IF THE EARTH HAD SWALLOWED THEM UP SHE WHISTLED AND CALLED BUT ONLY THE BIRDS ANSWERED HER THEN SHE SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND AND WEPT BITTERLY
AND MORE THAN THIS IT WAS THE GIANT WHO HAD STOLEN THE OXEN AND THE ASSES AND THE PIGS IN REVENGE FOR HER KINDNESS AND THE GIRL ASKED HIM WHAT CAN I DO TO DISENCHANT YOU BUT HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN WHO OPENED IT I WILL TELL HIM OF YOUR PRAYER AND THE WIND LOOKED ON HER AND KNEW HER AGAIN FOR HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE COTTAGE AND IN THE PALACE AND HE SPAKE TO HER AND SAID
AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK SHE IMPLORED THE WIND TO DO ALL HE COULD TO GET THE WEDDING PUT OFF FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR IT WOULD TAKE HER ALL THAT TIME TO REACH THE PALACE OF THE KING THE WIND GLADLY PROMISED TO DO WHAT HE COULD
CRYING PLEADING THREATENING THEN AT LAST IT WAS OVER THE HANDS TURNED ODIN UPON HIS BACK AND HE LAY THERE GASPING AND HURTING LIKE ONE WHO HAS JUST COME UP FROM DEEP WATER
WE BROUGHT YOU HERE AND TOOK OFF ALL THIS TIME I HAVE HAD A FIX ON HAGEN CAN'T WE OVERTAKE HIM ODIN ASKED WE ARE TRYING TO HE SEEMS TO BE HEADING FOR A HUGE DUST CLOUD
AND HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND ASKED HER WHAT HE COULD GIVE HER IN RETURN AND SHE SAID THAT THE ONLY REWARD HE COULD GIVE HER WAS TO TAKE THE SPELL OFF THE LION AND BRING HIM BACK TO HIS OWN SHAPE FOR A LONG TIME THE GIANT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT
VERY WELL REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN THEN COME WITH ME SO HE TOOK HER THROUGH THE OPENING MADE BY THE TORN UP ROOT AND THEY TRAVELLED TILL THEY REACHED A BEAUTIFUL PALACE SPLENDIDLY FURNISHED BUT ONLY LIGHTED FROM THE TOP
AND TURNING SHE SAW BEFORE HER A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHO ASKED WHY SHE HAD COME TO STEAL HIS FIREWOOD THE GIRL WHO FELT MUCH CONFUSED ONLY MANAGED TO STAMMER OUT AS AN EXCUSE THAT HER FATHER HAD SENT HER
TO HER GREAT SURPRISE BEHELD THE SAME LION STRETCHED ON THE GROUND WITH A DEEP WOUND ACROSS HIS FACE THIS TIME SHE WAS NOT AFRAID AT ALL AND RAN TOWARDS HIM WASHING THE WOUND AND LAYING SOOTHING HERBS UPON IT
MIGHT SAY THAT WE ARE MASTER ELECTRONICIANS REBUILDING CIRCUITS REPAIRING TRANSISTORS AND CONDENSERS YOU WERE PLENTY ROUGH GUNNAR GRUMBLED WE HAD TO BE
AND TELL ME WHERE WE ARE IT WAS ATO'S TURN TO TALK I THREW THE NEBULA INTO THE FOURTH DRIVE SOME TIME AGO THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TO SAVE YOUR LIVES TOO WE SHOULD CHECK ON THAT NEA
AND CARRYING IT CAREFULLY IN HER ARMS SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY A COURT DRESS WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED THE PRINCESS SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH DELIGHT FOR SHE HAD BEEN THINKING THAT
BY AND BYE IT CAME TO THE EARS OF THE PRINCESS AND SHE SENT FOR THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AND HOW BEAUTIFULLY SHE HAD DRESSED HER HAIR THE PRINCESS TOLD HER SHE WAS TO COME AND COMB OUT HERS NOW THE HAIR OF THE PRINCESS WAS VERY THICK AND LONG
ODIN FANCIED THAT HE COULD HEAR THE TWO KALIS PURRING CONTENTEDLY LIKE CATS WELL THEY HAD DONE A GOOD JOB LET THEM PURR HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THANKED THEM BUT HOW CAN YOU THANK TWO BOWLING BALLS WITH SCALPS OF CAT'S WHISKER WIRE
NO SOONER DID THE PRINCESS CAST HER EYES ON THE PETTICOATS THAN SHE DECLARED THEY WERE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MANTLE AND THAT SHE WOULD GIVE THE MAIDEN WHATEVER PRICE SHE WANTED FOR THEM AND THE MAIDEN NAMED MANY PIECES OF GOLD
THE VOICE WAS GUNNAR'S THREE TIMES MORE THE SOFT MANE OF HAIR CARESSED HIM AND THREE TIMES MORE JUST AS HE WAS GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP THE TORTURE BEGAN
AND AS SOON AS SHE REACHED THE DOOR SHE CRACKED HER NUT AND DREW OUT OF IT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MANTLE IN THE WORLD THEN SHE RANG THE BELL AND ASKED IS NOT THE PRINCESS TO BE MARRIED TO DAY YES SHE IS
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY MAN TO WED HER WHO CAN TELL THE DESPAIR WHICH SEIZED THE POOR MAIDEN WHEN SHE HEARD THIS NEWS
BUT IN THE END HE GAVE IN AND TOLD HER EXACTLY HOW IT MUST ALL BE DONE SHE WAS TO KILL THE LION HERSELF AND CUT HIM UP VERY SMALL THEN SHE MUST BURN HIM AND CAST HIS ASHES INTO THE WATER
AT LENGTH THE PRINCESS LOST PATIENCE AND EXCLAIMED YOU MAY HAVE IT THEN ON CONDITION THAT YOU SHALL FIND THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD TO BE MY BRIDEGROOM AND THE GIRL ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD
AND I ALSO TOLD YOU THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THEM THAN YOU SAW THEY ARE DESTROYERS AND THEY ARE BUILDERS WE FOUND YOU DEAD OR NEARLY SO HAGEN HAD SENT VOLT AFTER VOLT THROUGH YOUR BODIES
WHERE ALL THE BOGIES OF THE STONE AGE STILL COWERED ODIN YELLED IN PAIN AND FOUGHT BUT THE HANDS HELD HIM TIGHT IN HIS EARS HE COULD HEAR SOMEONE ELSE SCREAMING AND CURSING THREATENING ALL SORTS OF VENGEANCE
RICH AS YOU ARE WANT HELP AND SHE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY AND THE WIND LISTENED AND WAS SORRY FOR HER AND HE GAVE HER A WALNUT THAT SHE WAS TO EAT IN TIME OF NEED
BUT THE GIRL DID NOT GO AS THE WIND EXPECTED SHE WAS TIRED AND SAD AND KNEW NOT WHERE TO TURN SO SHE BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY THE WIND WEPT TOO FOR COMPANY AND SAID DON'T BE FRIGHTENED
AND TURNED AWAY FROM THE CASTLE THE MOMENT SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SHE BROKE HER ALMOND AND DREW FROM IT THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PETTICOATS THAT EVER WERE SEEN THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND ASKED IF THE PRINCESS WISHED TO BUY ANY PETTICOATS
HE PUSHED ASIDE THE ROCK AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND IT NEXT MORNING OUT CAME THE LION HE LOOKED SHARPLY ABOUT HIM ON ALL SIDES BUT SAW NO ONE AND THEN VANISHED INTO THE FOREST
BUT SHE CRIED LOUDLY THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM THE COAT AND THEN HE GREW QUIET AND INVITED HER TO COME INTO HIS HOUSE HE TRIED ON THE COAT BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT AND HE THREW IT OFF AND DECLARED IT WAS NO USE AND THE GIRL PICKED IT UP SADLY
THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LIKED HER LOOKS FOR SHE WAS CLEAN AND NEAT THE MAIDEN WOULD LISTEN TO NONE AND STILL CONTINUED CRYING WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT WHO WILL HIRE ME FOR A SERVANT AT LAST THERE CAME THE WAITING MAID OF THE PRINCESS
IT WAS PLAINLY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE WEDDING CLOTHES COULD BE READY NEXT DAY HOWEVER THE KING WAS MUCH TOO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER MARRIED TO LISTEN TO ANY EXCUSES AND HE DECLARED THAT A DRESS MUST BE PUT TOGETHER SOMEHOW FOR THE BRIDE TO WEAR
ALL HAIL SAID THE GIRL
AND WHEN SHE HAD BOUND IT UP THE LION THANKED HER IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE AFTER THAT SHE RETURNED TO HER FLOCK BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SHE SEARCHED HERE AND SHE SEARCHED THERE BUT THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY
CHAPTER TWELVE HE HAD BEEN DROWNED HE WAS FLOATING IN A SEA OF LIGHT AND NOW AND THEN SHINING LITTLE FISHES SWAM INQUISITIVELY UP TO HIM AND STARED
THE WHOLE PALACE WOULD FALL TO THE GROUND AND THE GRASS WOULD GROW OVER IT AND THE DAMSEL HERSELF WOULD BE REMEMBERED NO MORE THE BRIDE PROMISED TO BE CAREFUL BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER TO DO
THE MAIDEN THEN CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE AND DID EXACTLY AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE THUS THREE DAYS WENT BY AND EVERY DAY SHE WENT AND TIDIED UP THE PALACE AT LENGTH WHEN THE GIRL FOUND SHE WAS NO NEARER TO DISCOVERING THE SECRET
AND FOUND THEM SUCH GOOD FEEDING GROUNDS THAT THEY GREW FATTER EVERY DAY ANOTHER YEAR PASSED BY AND ONE MORNING WHEN THE MAIDEN WAS OUT WITH HER PIGS SHE HEARD A GROAN WHICH SOUNDED QUITE HUMAN SHE RAN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS
CATCHING JUMPING CLIMBING BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE THE LACE WAS TORN THE SATIN STAINED THE PEARLS KNOCKED OFF
AND IT SHOULD BE GIVEN HER THE MAIDEN FIXED A LARGE SUM MANY PIECES OF GOLD BUT THE PRINCESS HAD SET HER HEART ON THE MANTLE AND GAVE IT READILY NOW THE MAIDEN HID HER GOLD IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESS
THEN SHE HAD TO GO HOME AND CONFESS TO HER MASTER WHO FIRST SCOLDED HER AND AFTERWARDS BEAT HER NOW GO HE ENDED AND LOOK AFTER THE PIGS SO THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK OUT THE PIGS
I WILL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT SOMETHING AND THE WIND DEPARTED WITH A GREAT NOISE AND FUSS AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE HE WAS BACK AGAIN BEAMING WITH DELIGHT
SHE KISSED ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ODIN A MYSTERIOUS SMILE THE KALIS BEGAN PURRING CONTENTEDLY AS THOUGH SPACE WERE NO MORE THAN A HUGE LIVING ROOM AND THEY WERE BESIDE A COMFORTABLE FIREPLACE LOOKING UP
SHE GAVE JACK ODIN A SEARCHING LOOK BUT ODIN AVOIDED HER GAZE THEN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ODIN ASKED
WHAT CAN YOU DO SHE SAID
HE IS UNCOMMONLY BOLD GOD GUIDE HIM HE HAS AN ANSWER READY FOR EVERYTHING
AFTER THE TWO HAD AGREED TOGETHER AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO AND SAY THE OLD MERCHANT WENT ON VARIOUS INGENIOUS PRETEXTS TO PAY VISITS TO THE PRINCIPAL HOUSES OF CARENTAN
BUT THAT ALWAYS TOUCHES US BECAUSE ALL MEN ARE FLATTERED BY THE SACRIFICES THAT ANY WOMAN MAKES FOR ANY ONE OF THEM THE MERCHANT TOLD THE COUNTESS OF THE GOSSIP THAT WAS CIRCULATING IN THE TOWN AND SHOWED HER THE DANGER THAT SHE WAS RUNNING HE WOUND UP AT LAST WITH SAYING THAT
THEY WENT TO INQUIRE INTO THE MISFORTUNE GRIEF OR ILLNESS
WHILE THE OLD MERCHANT LOOKED FOR HIS SPECTACLES AND WIPED THEM SHE RAISED HER EYES AND FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED AT HIM WITH CURIOSITY THEN IN AN UNCERTAIN VOICE I TRUST IN YOU SHE SAID SOFTLY
HER CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THE NOBLE FAMILIES OF THE DISTRICT BUT NOW FROM POLITIC MOTIVES SHE OPENED HER HOUSE TO THE PRINCIPAL CITIZENS AND TO THE REVOLUTIONARY AUTHORITIES OF THE TOWN ENDEAVORING TO TOUCH AND GRATIFY THEIR SOCIAL PRIDE
SHE WENT DOWN TO HER OWN ROOM BRIGITTE AND THE OLD SERVING MAN HALF CARRYING HER BETWEEN THEM THE HOUSEKEEPER SET HER MISTRESS IN A CHAIR AND BROKE OUT WHAT MADAME IS THAT MAN TO SLEEP IN MONSIEUR AUGUSTE'S BED
OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF HER OLD FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AND STILL PRESERVED NOT THE FRESH HIGH COLORED BEAUTY OF THE BASSE NORMANDES BUT A FRAGILE LOVELINESS OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED AN ARISTOCRATIC TYPE
BUT AFTER CAREFULLY FOLLOWING OUT TRONCHIN'S SINGULAR PRESCRIPTION SHE WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO RECEIVE VISITORS THAT EVENING THIS TALE HAD AN IMMENSE SUCCESS IN CARENTAN
THE MAN SERVANT WAS BEATING A CARPET IN THE GARDEN ONLY YESTERDAY NO ONE WOULD HAVE REMARKED THE FACT BUT TO DAY EVERYBODY BEGAN TO BUILD ROMANCES UPON THAT HARMLESS PIECE OF HOUSEHOLD STUFF EVERYONE HAD A VERSION ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
A LOOK THAT SEEMED TO SAY THAT THE SPRINGS OF HER LIFE LAY WITHOUT HER OWN EXISTENCE IN HER EARLY GIRLHOOD SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED TO AN ELDERLY AND JEALOUS SOLDIER HER FALSE POSITION IN THE MIDST OF A GAY COURT HAD DOUBTLESS DONE SOMETHING
AND WAS OBLIGED TO ASK THE WAY TO THE MAYOR'S HOUSE OF A WEAVER WHO WAS WORKING LATE THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT FAR TO SEEK AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE CONSCRIPT WAS SITTING ON A STONE BENCH IN THE MAYOR'S PORCH WAITING FOR HIS BILLET HE WAS SENT FOR HOWEVER
THE MOON SHONE ON THE PASTURE LAND ABOUT CARENTAN BUT HE HAD NOTICED GREAT MASSES OF WHITE CLOUD THAT WERE ABOUT TO SCATTER SHOWERS OF SNOW OVER THE COUNTRY
I PUT A KEY IN THE BIBLE AND HELD IT ON MY FINGERS WHILE COTTIN READ THE GOSPEL OF SAINT JOHN AND THE KEY DID NOT TURN MADAME IS THAT A CERTAIN SIGN THE COUNTESS ASKED WHY YES MADAME EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE
IF THERE ARE SOME OF OUR PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY READY TO PARDON A PIECE OF HEROISM ON YOUR PART SO LONG AS IT IS A PRIEST THAT YOU WISH TO SAVE NO ONE WILL SHOW YOU ANY MERCY IF IT IS DISCOVERED THAT YOU ARE SACRIFICING YOURSELF TO THE DICTATES OF YOUR HEART
THOUGH IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN THEY EXCITED THE GREATEST CURIOSITY FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE
BUT IN DESPITE OF THE DANGER OF MATCHING HERSELF AGAINST NORMAN CUNNING SHE USED ALL THE CRAFT AND INVENTIVENESS THAT NATURE HAS BESTOWED ON WOMEN TO PLAY OFF THE RIVAL SUITORS ONE AGAINST ANOTHER SHE HOPED BY GAINING TIME
HURRIED THITHER AT AN EARLY HOUR SOME TO WATCH HER FACE SOME OUT OF FRIENDSHIP BUT THE MORE PART ATTRACTED BY THE FAME OF THE MARVELOUS CURE THEY FOUND THE COUNTESS SEATED IN A CORNER OF THE GREAT CHIMNEY PIECE IN HER ROOM
FOR AT THE VERY HOUR WHEN SHE DIED AT CARENTAN HER SON WAS SHOT IN LE MORBIHAN THIS TRAGICAL STORY MAY BE ADDED TO ALL THE INSTANCES ON RECORD OF THE WORKINGS OF SYMPATHIES UNCONTROLLED BY THE LAWS OF TIME AND SPACE
THE MAN'S EYES LOOKED STUPID WITH THE STRAIN OF LISTENING TO THE FAINT SOUNDS OF THE NIGHT SHE STARED INTO THE DARKNESS SEEING HER SON IN EVERY SHADOW EVERYWHERE BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF HIGH SPIRITS
I WOULD STAKE MY SALVATION ON IT GOD CANNOT BE MISTAKEN IF ONLY I COULD SEE HIM HERE IN THE HOUSE IN SPITE OF THE DANGER
AND THESE MEN WEIGHED THEMSELVES AND INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT THEY WERE FOUND WANTING SUCH A NATURE DEMANDED AN EXALTED PASSION MOREOVER
THEY WOULD INSTINCTIVELY HAVE FELT FOR EACH OTHER A FRIENDSHIP THAT IS RARELY MET WITH BETWEEN TWO MEN
THAT REDOUBTABLE FUNCTIONARY WAS ALONE WITH THE COUNTESS WHO WAITED TREMBLING TILL HE SHOULD GO THERE WAS SOMETHING APPALLING IN THEIR LONG SILENCE
THE OLD MERCHANT TOOK A BOLDER STEP HE CALLED THAT MORNING UPON THE LADY STRONG IN THE THOUGHT OF THE SERVICE HE MEANT TO DO HER
AND MADE HERSELF NECESSARY TO THE WELL TO DO BY PROVIDING AMUSEMENTS FOR THEM THE PROCUREUR OF THE COMMUNE MIGHT BE SEEN AT HER HOUSE THE MAYOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
FEELING NO DOUBTS AS TO HIS MEANS OF ESCAPE HE WROTE THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WAS SURE TO REACH HER DISGUISED THE SAME LETTER THAT BROUGHT THESE WEIGHTY TIDINGS WAS FULL OF HEARTRENDING FAREWELLS IN CASE THE WRITER SHOULD NOT BE IN CARENTAN BY THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY
AND EVEN THE JUDGES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS WENT THERE THE FOUR FIRST NAMED GENTLEMEN WERE NONE OF THEM MARRIED
SHE FELT SCARCELY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO STAND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SPRANG HALF DEAD WITH FEAR INTO HER SON'S ARMS OH MY CHILD MY CHILD SHE SOBBED COVERING HIM WITH ALMOST FRENZIED KISSES MADAME SAID A STRANGER'S VOICE OH
THE PROSECUTOR ASKED KINDLY AS IF HE TOO WERE IN THE SECRET OF THE HOUSEHOLD A CONSCRIPT THAT THE MAYOR HAS SENT HERE FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING THE WOMAN REPLIED HOLDING OUT THE BILLET SO IT IS SAID THE PROSECUTOR WHEN HE HAD READ THE SLIP OF PAPER
BUT AN UNWONTED INTEREST ATTACHED TO THIS EVENING'S GATHERING
THE BOY HAD GROWN UP AND DEVELOPED SO FAVORABLY THAT AT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN AT THE COURT OF VERSAILLES ONE FINAL HAPPINESS THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS CROWN A MOTHER'S EFFORTS WAS HERS HER SON WORSHIPED HER
AND THE DEPTHS OF PASSION IN HER HEART HAD NEVER BEEN STIRRED IN THIS LAY THE SECRET OF HER GREATEST CHARM A YOUTHFULNESS OF THE INMOST SOUL BETRAYED AT TIMES BY HER FACE AND A CERTAIN TINGE OF INNOCENT WISTFULNESS IN HER IDEAS
ALL THOSE PREPARATIONS MADE FOR HIM MEANT THAT HE WAS ALIVE SHE WENT DOWN BUT SHE LINGERED A MOMENT IN THE PERISTYLE FOR ANY SOUND THAT MIGHT WAKEN THE SLEEPING ECHOES OF THE TOWN SHE SMILED AT BRIGITTE'S HUSBAND WHO WAS STANDING THERE ON GUARD
ON A NOVEMBER EVENING IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
THE CONSCRIPT READ THE DIRECTION CURIOUSLY HE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT HE HAS NOT FAR TO GO
AND THAT IN SPITE OF HER INDISPOSITION SHE WOULD RECEIVE THAT EVENING MATCHING HIS SHREWDNESS AGAINST NORMAN WITS IN THE CROSS EXAMINATION HE UNDERWENT IN EVERY FAMILY AS TO THE COUNTESS'S COMPLAINT
AND WHEN SHE READ THE RIGOROUS LAWS IN VIRTUE OF WHICH THE REPUBLIC WAS DAILY CONFISCATING THE PROPERTY OF EMIGRANTS AT CARENTAN SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON THE COURAGEOUS COURSE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN
A MOTHER'S LOVE FOR HER SON ALL THE HAPPINESS AND JOY THAT SHE HAD NOT KNOWN AS A WIFE SHE HAD FOUND LATER IN HER BOUNDLESS LOVE FOR HIM THE COQUETRY OF A MISTRESS THE JEALOUSY OF A WIFE MINGLED WITH THE PURE AND DEEP AFFECTION OF A MOTHER
THE COUNTESS MADE AN INVOLUNTARY SIGN OF DENIAL BUT HER FACE HAD GROWN WHITE AND DRAWN WITH THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THE COMPOSURE THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL AND NO TREMOR WAS LOST ON THE MERCILESS PROSECUTOR
THE MAYOR HAD A BELIEF IN A PRIEST WHO HAD REFUSED THE OATH
AND HAD KNOWN THE INEXPRESSIBLE JOY OF WATCHING HIM PASS SAFELY THROUGH THE PERILS OF INFANCY OF SEEING HIS CONSTITUTION STRENGTHEN IN SPITE OF THE DECREES OF THE FACULTY THANKS TO HER CONSTANT CARE
DO YOU HEAR NOTHING BRIGITTE OH I WOULD GIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE TO KNOW WHETHER HE IS STILL IN PRISON OR TRAMPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER NOT THINK ONCE MORE SHE LOOKED TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER
WITH A HEART RENDING INFLECTION IN HER VOICE SHE DREW A CHAIR TO THE TABLE AS IF TO STRENGTHEN HER ILLUSIONS AND REALIZE HER LONGINGS AH MADAME HE IS COMING HE IS NOT FAR OFF I HAVEN'T A DOUBT THAT HE IS LIVING AND ON HIS WAY BRIGITTE ANSWERED
HAD MADE PARTIES OF WHIST BOSTON OR REVERSIS AND SAT TALKING WITH SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE SHE SEEMED TO BE LIVING COMPLETELY IN THE PRESENT MOMENT AND PLAYED HER PART LIKE A CONSUMMATE ACTRESS SHE ELICITED A SUGGESTION OF LOTO
AND HE IMPLORED HIS MOTHER TO SEND A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY BY THE BEARER WHO HAD GONE THROUGH DANGERS INNUMERABLE TO DELIVER IT THE PAPER SHOOK IN THE OLD MAN'S HANDS
SHE WAS RESERVED IN HER DEMEANOR BUT IN HER BEARING AND IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING THAT TOLD OF GIRLISH LONGINGS DIRECTED TOWARD A VAGUE FUTURE BEFORE VERY LONG THE LEAST SUSCEPTIBLE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
HE UNDERSTOOD THE COUNTESS'S JOY AND HER PROSTRATION HER SON HAD TAKEN PART IN THE GRANVILLE EXPEDITION HE WROTE TO HIS MOTHER FROM HIS PRISON AND THE LETTER BROUGHT HER A SAD SWEET HOPE
AND CONFRONTED WITH THAT FUNCTIONARY WHO SCRUTINIZED HIM CLOSELY THE FOOT SOLDIER WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE OF GENTLE BIRTH THERE WAS SOMETHING ARISTOCRATIC IN HIS BEARING AND SIGNS IN HIS FACE OF INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED BY A GOOD EDUCATION
OTHERS VOTED FOR A NOBLE ESCAPED FROM THE PRISONS OF PARIS IN SHORT ONE AND ALL SUSPECTED THAT THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME PIECE OF GENEROSITY THAT THE LAW OF THOSE DAYS DEFINED AS A CRIME
SERVANTS WERE HELPING THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES INTO SABOTS GREATCOATS AND CALASHES THE CARD PLAYERS SETTLED THEIR ACCOUNTS AND EVERYBODY WENT OUT TOGETHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ALL LITTLE COUNTRY TOWNS
A KNIGHT OF THE ORDERS OF SAINT MICHAEL AND OF THE HOLY GHOST SHE HAD LEFT THE COURT WHEN THE EMIGRATION BEGAN AND TAKEN REFUGE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CARENTAN WHERE SHE HAD LARGE ESTATES HOPING THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE REIGN OF TERROR WOULD BE BUT LITTLE FELT THERE
ELDERLY GENTLEMEN TAKING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL NOTICED A SORT OF SUPPRESSED BUSTLE IN THE COUNTESS'S HOUSE THE SYMPTOMS WERE THE MORE APPARENT BECAUSE THE SERVANTS WERE AT EVIDENT PAINS TO CONCEAL THEM
THE JOKE WAS HAZARDED DISCREETLY WOMEN AND MEN ELDERLY FOLK AND YOUNG GIRLS
BUT ALL SHE HAD OF KITH OR KIN IN THE WORLD THE ONE HUMAN BEING ON EARTH BOUND TO HER BY ALL THE FEARS AND HOPES AND JOYS OF HER LIFE THE LATE COMTE DE DEY WAS THE LAST OF HIS RACE AND SHE HIS WIFE
AND ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HER DOOR HAD BEEN SHUT ON THE GROUND OF INDISPOSITION
THE YOUNG FELLOWS WENT AHEAD OF THEIR COMPANY TO THE NEXT HALTING PLACE OR LAGGED BEHIND IT IT DEPENDED UPON THEIR FITNESS TO BEAR THE FATIGUES OF A LONG MARCH THIS PARTICULAR WAYFARER WAS SOME CONSIDERABLE WAY IN ADVANCE OF A COMPANY OF CONSCRIPTS ON THE WAY TO CHERBOURG
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO TELL ME NOTHING SHE ANSWERED IN AMAZEMENT AH MADAME CRIED THE PROSECUTOR SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER AND CHANGING HIS TONE AT THIS MOMENT FOR LACK OF A WORD ONE OF US YOU OR I
THE CLOCKS IN CARENTAN STRUCK HALF PAST NINE AS HE SPOKE
AND SAYING THAT NO ONE ELSE KNEW WHERE TO FIND THE GAME SHE LEFT THE ROOM MY GOOD BRIGITTE I CANNOT BREATHE DOWN THERE SHE CRIED BRUSHING AWAY THE TEARS THAT SPRANG TO HER EYES THAT GLITTERED WITH FEVER SORROW AND IMPATIENCE
EITHER FROM FEAR OF MAKING AN ENEMY OR FROM A DESIRE TO FIND A PROTECTOR THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR ONCE AN ATTORNEY AT CAEN AND THE COUNTESS'S MAN OF BUSINESS DID WHAT HE COULD TO INSPIRE LOVE BY A SYSTEM OF DEVOTION AND GENEROSITY
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT HE ADDED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND SEEING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WE KNOW WHERE TO SEND YOU
RETURNED THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND HIS EYES GREW BRIGHT AS HE LOOKED AT HER IF IT COSTS US OUR LIVES LOST SHE WAILED THE PROSECUTOR RAISED HER POLITELY
HAD FALLEN IN WITH THE WAYS OF THE PLACE AND ADOPTED PROVINCIAL LIFE WITHOUT FLINCHING BEFORE ITS CAST IRON NARROWNESS ITS MOST DISAGREEABLE HARDSHIPS BUT KNOWING THAT HER GUESTS WOULD FORGIVE HER FOR ANY PRODIGALITY THAT CONDUCED TO THEIR COMFORT
WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE AND SHE BROKE OFF I AM SURE OF MY BROTHER THE OLD MERCHANT WENT ON I WILL ENGAGE HIM IN YOUR INTERESTS THE MERCHANT IN THIS CRISIS RECOVERED HIS OLD BUSINESS SHREWDNESS
REMARKED THE NORMAN IN SARCASTIC TONES I AM THREE LEAGUES AHEAD OF THE BATTALION SOME SENTIMENT ATTRACTS YOU TO CARENTAN OF COURSE CITIZEN CONSCRIPT SAID THE MAYOR ASTUTELY
I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC ARE CARRIED OUT
AND BETWEEN THESE TWO THERE WAS THE DEEP SYMPATHY OF KINDRED SOULS
SEVERAL TIMES THEY PUT AWKWARD QUESTIONS WHICH THE COUNTESS ANSWERED WITH WONDERFUL PRESENCE OF MIND SO BRAVE IS A MOTHER'S HEART
AND HAD MADE IT A POINT OF HONOR TO FOLLOW THE EMIGRANT PRINCES INTO EXILE
HER TONGUE FROZEN A KNOCK AT THE DOOR RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE OH CRIED THE TERRIFIED MOTHER FALLING UPON HER KNEES SAVE HIM SAVE HIM YES LET US SAVE HIM
IT LOOKS AS IF THE PROSECUTOR MEANT TO STOP SAID A LADY WHO NOTICED THAT THAT IMPORTANT PERSONAGE WAS NOT IN THE GROUP IN THE MARKET PLACE WHERE THEY ALL TOOK LEAVE OF ONE ANOTHER BEFORE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS HOME AND AS A MATTER OF FACT
SHE HAD GONE UP TO HER SON'S ROOM AND WAS LOOKING ROUND IT HE DOES NOT COME SHE SAID HERE I CAN BREATHE AND LIVE A FEW MINUTES MORE AND HE WILL BE HERE FOR HE IS ALIVE I AM SURE THAT HE IS ALIVE MY HEART TELLS ME SO
CLEAN LINEN SLIPPERS NO NECESSARY NO COMFORT WAS LACKING FOR THE WEARY TRAVELER AND ALL THE DELIGHTS OF HOME HEAPED UPON HIM SHOULD REVEAL HIS MOTHER'S LOVE OH BRIGITTE CRIED THE COUNTESS
AND YET STOOD SOMEWHAT IN AWE OF HER DIGNITY AND HIGH BRED MANNER HER GREAT SOUL STRENGTHENED BY THE CRUEL ORDEALS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD PASSED SEEMED TO SET HER TOO FAR ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL
SO DEEP AND SINCERE WAS THE INTEREST THAT SHE INSPIRED THAT THOSE WHO USUALLY FILLED HER DRAWING ROOM FELT A LIVELY ANXIETY WHEN THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THEN WITH THE FRANK CURIOSITY CHARACTERISTIC OF PROVINCIAL MANNERS
AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD ASSURED HERSELF THAT THEY WERE ALONE SHE DREW A SOILED TORN LETTER FROM HER BODICE READ IT SHE CRIED WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT TO PRONOUNCE THE WORDS SHE DROPPED AS IF EXHAUSTED INTO HER ARMCHAIR
THE COUNTESS'S FACE WORE A STRANGE LOOK THAT CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS DEEPLY MOVED BY THE DEVOTION SO NATURAL TO WOMEN
SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND THE DULL MISERY IN HER EYES WOULD HAVE SOFTENED A TIGER I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE DENUNCIATION WAS FALSE BY MAKING A THOROUGH SEARCH HE WENT ON IN A GENTLE VOICE
AH MONSIEUR SHE SAID LEANING ON THE ARM OF BRIGITTE'S HUSBAND FEELING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FULL EXTENT OF A SORROW THAT HAD ALL BUT KILLED HER AT ITS FIRST THREATENING AH MONSIEUR I CANNOT STAY TO SEE YOU ANY LONGER
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO DISCIPLINE KEPT UP THE EXIGENCIES OF THE MOMENT SCARCELY ADMITTED OF SOLDIERS BEING EQUIPPED AT ONCE AND IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING TO SEE THE ROADS THRONGED WITH CONSCRIPTS IN THEIR ORDINARY CLOTHES
THE DISCREET WARNINGS OF EXQUISITE TACT ENABLED HER TO STEER A DIFFICULT COURSE AMONG THE EXACTING CLAIMS OF THIS MIXED SOCIETY WITHOUT WOUNDING THE OVERWEENING SELF LOVE OF PARVENUS ON THE ONE HAND
AND THE WOMEN KIND WERE THE FIRST TO FIND OUT THAT BRIGITTE HAD LAID IN AN EXTRA STOCK OF PROVISIONS THE THING COULD NOT BE DISPUTED
WITHOUT AROUSING EITHER HATRED OR JEALOUSY GRACIOUS AND KINDLY POSSESSED OF THE INDESCRIBABLE CHARM THAT WINS GOOD WILL WITHOUT LOSS OF DIGNITY OR EFFORT TO PAY COURT TO ANY SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GAINING UNIVERSAL ESTEEM
AND HE HANDED OVER THE BILLET
MAY CARRY OUR HEADS TO THE SCAFFOLD I HAVE WATCHED YOUR CHARACTER YOUR SOUL YOUR MANNER TOO CLOSELY TO SHARE THE ERROR INTO WHICH YOU HAVE MANAGED TO LEAD YOUR VISITORS TO NIGHT YOU ARE EXPECTING YOUR SON I COULD NOT DOUBT IT
WHICH WAS ALMOST AS MODESTLY FURNISHED AS SIMILAR APARTMENTS IN CARENTAN FOR SHE HAD GIVEN UP THE ENJOYMENT OF LUXURIES TO WHICH SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN ACCUSTOMED FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING THE NARROW PREJUDICES OF HER GUESTS AND SHE HAD MADE NO CHANGES IN HER HOUSE
AND WAS AMAZED BEYOND EXPRESSION TO FIND HER OUT IN THE GARDEN BUSY GATHERING THE LAST AUTUMN FLOWERS IN HER BORDERS TO FILL THE VASES SHE HAS GIVEN REFUGE TO HER LOVER NO DOUBT THOUGHT THE OLD MAN STRUCK WITH PITY FOR THE CHARMING WOMAN BEFORE HIM
AND DOUBTLESS SOME DREADFUL VISION
THE FLOOR WAS NOT EVEN POLISHED SHE HAD LEFT THE OLD SOMBER HANGINGS ON THE WALLS HAD KEPT THE OLD FASHIONED COUNTRY FURNITURE BURNED TALLOW CANDLES
AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN A STABLE THAT MUST HAVE KILLED HER
WAS SHE NOT KEEPING WATCH OVER THE WEALTH OF HER SON AT THE RISK OF HER LIFE LATER WHEN NEWS CAME OF THE HORRIBLE EXECUTIONS ORDERED BY THE CONVENTION SHE SLEPT HAPPY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER OWN TREASURE WAS IN SAFETY OUT OF REACH OF PERIL
AND WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE HAD BOUGHT THE ONE HARE TO BE HAD
HE SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING ALMOST EVERYONE WHO TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR UPON THE WRONG SCENT HIS VERY FIRST CALL WORKED WONDERS HE TOLD IN THE HEARING OF A GOUTY OLD LADY HOW THAT
THAT MADE HIM TREMBLE OLD THOUGH HE WAS COME IN SHE SAID
HER FIGURE WAS LISSOME AND SLENDER HER FEATURES DELICATE AND CLEARLY CUT THE PALE FACE SEEMED TO LIGHT UP AND LIVE WHEN SHE SPOKE BUT THERE WAS A QUIET AND DEVOUT LOOK IN THE GREAT DARK EYES FOR ALL THEIR GRACIOUSNESS OF EXPRESSION
THE CHILD WAS ALL THE DEARER BECAUSE ONLY WITH INFINITE CARE HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN REARING HIM TO MAN'S ESTATE MEDICAL SCIENCE HAD PREDICTED HIS DEATH A SCORE OF TIMES BUT SHE HAD HELD FAST TO HER PRESENTIMENTS AND HER HOPES
EXISTENCE IS IN SOME SORT INCOMPLETE BUT IN THOSE TIMES WHEN THE LEAST INDISCRETION ON THE PART OF AN ARISTOCRAT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
SHE WAS RICH NOBLE AND THE MOTHER OF AN EMIGRANT WITH THE ONE DESIRE TO LOOK AFTER HER SON'S GREAT FORTUNE SHE HAD DENIED HERSELF THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WITH HIM
THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR MOREOVER SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THEY MUST HUSH THE MATTER UP AND TRY TO SAVE THE UNFORTUNATE LADY FROM THE ABYSS TOWARD WHICH SHE WAS HASTENING IF YOU SPREAD REPORTS ABOUT HE ADDED
FAR FROM THE SCAFFOLDS OF THE REVOLUTION SHE LOVED TO THINK THAT SHE HAD FOLLOWED THE BEST COURSE THAT SHE HAD SAVED HER DARLING AND HER DARLING'S FORTUNES AND TO THIS SECRET THOUGHT SHE MADE SUCH CONCESSIONS AS THE MISFORTUNES OF THE TIMES DEMANDED
IT IS NOT HE SHE CRIED SHRINKING AWAY IN TERROR AND SHE STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE CONSCRIPT GAZING AT HIM WITH HAGGARD EYES O SAINT BON DIEU HOW LIKE HE IS CRIED BRIGITTE THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
EVER KEEPING WATCH OVER HER MISTRESS'S MOVEMENTS DID NOT SEE HER COME OUT AGAIN AND WHEN SHE WENT SHE FOUND THE COUNTESS LYING THERE DEAD I EXPECT SHE HEARD THAT CONSCRIPT CRIED BRIGITTE WALKING ABOUT MONSIEUR AUGUSTE'S ROOM
HOW THAT THE ILLUSTRIOUS TRONCHIN HAD RECOMMENDED HER IN SUCH A CASE TO PUT THE SKIN FROM A LIVE HARE ON HER CHEST TO STOP IN BED AND KEEP PERFECTLY STILL THE COUNTESS HE SAID HAD LAIN IN DANGER OF HER LIFE FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS
I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE MATTER AND TO SEARCH THE HOUSE AND THEN HE SAID NO MORE BUT EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS LEFT UNSAID THE COUNTESS'S REAL FRIENDS WERE SO MUCH ALARMED FOR HER THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY
BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE COMPLAINED OF FEELING UNWELL AND WENT TO SIT IN HER GREAT CHAIR BY THE FIRESIDE
WHOM THE MAYOR WAS EXPECTING TO ARRIVE EVERY HOUR FOR IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR BILLETS THE YOUNG MAN'S FOOTSTEPS WERE STILL FIRM AS HE TRUDGED ALONG AND HIS BEARING SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NO STRANGER TO THE ROUGH LIFE OF A SOLDIER
I SHALL GO INTO THE CONSERVATORY I SHALL HEAR BETTER THERE IF ANYONE PASSES IN THE NIGHT SHE STILL WAVERED BETWEEN THE FEAR THAT SHE HAD LOST HER SON AND THE HOPE OF SEEING HIM ONCE MORE THAT NIGHT WAS HIDEOUSLY SILENT
HER SELF POSSESSION WAS UNSHAKEN THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL KEPT SILENCE HOWEVER NOTING THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE THAT FLICKERED OVER HER FEATURES LISTENING THROUGH THE NOISY TALK TO EVERY SOUND IN THE HOUSE
TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS BRIGITTE THE HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED WITH THE SAME FORMULA HER MISTRESS WAS KEEPING HER ROOM AND WOULD SEE NO ONE NOT EVEN HER OWN SERVANTS
MANY A ONE DURING THE DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION HAS DOUBTLESS PASSED THROUGH A CRISIS AS DIFFICULT AS HERS AT THAT MOMENT AND THE SYMPATHIES OF MORE THAN ONE READER WILL FILL IN ALL THE COLORING OF THE PICTURE
ADDED TO ITS EFFECT BY GRAVELY DISCUSSING THE SPECIFIC SUSPICION NEVERTHELESS HAD TAKEN TOO DEEP ROOT IN A FEW PERVERSE OR PHILOSOPHICAL MINDS TO BE ENTIRELY DISSIPATED SO IT FELL OUT THAT THOSE
BUT THIS LEFT HIM NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSED HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURCHASE OF A HARE ON A FRIDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT HAD STRONG LEANINGS TOWARD A CHOUAN CHIEF
VERY WELL THE REVOLUTIONARY OFFICIAL WENT ON RECEIVE HIM BUT DO NOT LET HIM STAY UNDER YOUR ROOF AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING FOR TO MORROW AS SOON AS IT IS LIGHT I SHALL COME WITH A DENUNCIATION THAT I WILL HAVE MADE OUT AND
THERE ALL THE RICH WIDOWS SUITORS WERE FAIN TO INVENT MORE OR LESS PROBABLE FICTIONS EACH ONE THINKING THE WHILE HOW TO TURN TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE THE SECRET THAT COMPELLED HER TO COMPROMISE HERSELF IN SUCH A MANNER
A BATTALION IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT AND HE WENT THE COUNTESS'S NEED TO BELIEVE IN THE FAITH OF HER SOMETIME ATTORNEY WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE DARED NOT ENTERTAIN ANY SUSPICION OF HIM SHE FLED UPSTAIRS
EVERYONE IMAGINED THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET IN IT AND EVERY HEAD WAS BUSY WITH THE SECRET NEXT DAY THE SUSPICIONS BECAME MALIGNANT EVERYONE LIVES IN PUBLIC IN A SMALL TOWN
MY REPORT SHALL BE SUCH THAT YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM ANY SUBSEQUENT SUSPICION I SHALL MAKE MENTION OF YOUR PATRIOTIC GIFTS YOUR CIVISM AND ALL OF US WILL BE SAFE
MEANWHILE ON THE ROAD FROM PARIS TO CHERBOURG A YOUNG MAN DRESSED IN THE INEVITABLE BROWN CARMAGNOLE OF THOSE DAYS WAS PLODDING HIS WAY TOWARD CARENTAN WHEN THE FIRST LEVIES WERE MADE
BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG THE DREADFUL QUIET SUCCEEDED AGAIN TOWARD MORNING THE COUNTESS WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO HER ROOM
PERMIT MY SERVANTS TO SUPPLY MY PLACE
AND BORE WITH THEIR TRIVIAL PROSINGS EVERY TIME THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AT EVERY SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE STREET SHE HID HER AGITATION BY RAISING QUESTIONS OF ABSORBING INTEREST TO THE COUNTRYSIDE
A BRIGHT FIRE BLAZED ON THE HEARTH THE SHUTTERS WERE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE FURNITURE SHONE WITH CLEANLINESS THE BED HAD BEEN MADE AFTER A FASHION THAT SHOWED THAT BRIGITTE AND THE COUNTESS HAD GIVEN THEIR MINDS TO EVERY TRIFLING DETAIL
THE MAGNATES OF CARENTAN WENT TO SPEND THE EVENING AT THE MAYOR'S BROTHER'S HOUSE HE WAS A RETIRED MERCHANT A MARRIED MAN A STRICTLY HONORABLE SOUL EVERYONE RESPECTED HIM AND THE COUNTESS HELD HIM IN HIGH REGARD
BY A PHENOMENON OF VISION OR OF LOCOMOTION HAS BEEN KNOWN AT TIMES TO ABOLISH SPACE IN ITS TWO MODES OF TIME AND DISTANCE THE ONE INTELLECTUAL THE OTHER PHYSICAL HISTORY OF LOUIS LAMBERT
ONCE FOR THE COUNTESS THERE WAS AN AWFUL INTERVAL WHEN THE BATTALION OF CONSCRIPTS ENTERED THE TOWN AND THE MEN WENT BY ONE BY ONE TO THEIR LODGINGS EVERY FOOTFALL EVERY SOUND IN THE STREET RAISED HOPES TO BE DISAPPOINTED
WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY IN A VOICE MADE DISCREETLY LOW ABOUT WHAT A PITY IT WAS THAT DEAR MISSUS SO AND SO SHOULD DO THIS OR THAT AND DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU AS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER THING
SHE WAS SICK TOO SAID AMY REGARDING THE DOLL IN HER ARMS WITH AN ANXIOUS AIR
THAT KATY STOPPED AT ONCE CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SHE ASKED I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE THE LADY ON THE SOFA OPENED HER EYES SHE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT TO KATY'S DISMAY BEGAN TO CRY INSTEAD
ONLY I KEEP THINKING OF POOR LITTLE MARIA MATILDA SHUT UP IN THE TRUNK IN THAT DARK PLACE AND WONDERING IF SHE'S SICK THERE'S NOBODY TO EXPLAIN TO HER DOWN THERE THEY SAY THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE MOTION HALF SO MUCH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP SAID KATY
SHE FELT VERY SORRY FOR POOR LITTLE AMY RAGING THERE IN HER HIGH BERTH LIKE SOME IMPRISONED CREATURE BUT SHE WAS POWERLESS TO HELP HER SHE COULD ONLY RESIGN HERSELF TO HER OWN DISCOMFORTS AND TRY TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMETIME THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST MEND
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN WEAKLY NOW THIS LONG TIME BACK AND BESS AND NANNY WERE BUT CHILDREN YET SO LUCY HAD TO TAKE COMMAND AND KEEP THINGS SHIP SHAPE WHEN HE WAS AWAY SHE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT WHEN THE STEAMER COMES IN SAID THE CAPTAIN
BY POST CRIED KATY IN AMAZEMENT WHY HOW CAN THAT BE THEN CATCHING SIGHT OF ROSE'S HANDWRITING ON THE ENVELOPE SHE UNDERSTOOD AND SMILED AT HER OWN SIMPLICITY THE STEWARDESS BEAMED AT HER AS SHE OPENED IT THEN SAYING AGAIN
AMY AND KATY BOTH FELT SUDDENLY RAVENOUS AND WHEN MISSUS ASHE AWHILE LATER WAS HELPED UP THE STAIRS SHE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THEM EATING COLD BEEF AND ROASTED POTATOES WITH THE FINEST APPETITES IN THE WORLD
ON ONE SIDE IRELAND ON THE OTHER THE BOLD MOUNTAIN LINES OF THE WELSH COAST IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ENTERED THE MERSEY AND DUSK HAD FALLEN BEFORE THE CAPTAIN GOT OUT HIS GLASS TO LOOK FOR THE WHITE FLUTTERING SPECK IN HIS OWN WINDOW WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
WELL THERE'S ANOTHER VOYAGE OVER AND DONE WITH THANK GOD AND MY MARY IS WHERE SHE WAS IT'S A LOAD TAKEN FROM MY MIND THE MOON HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING SOFTLY ON THE RIVER AS THE CROWDED TENDER LANDED THE PASSENGERS FROM THE SPARTACUS
WHO HAD FROZEN HIS STOMACH EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BY INDULGING ON A HOT SUMMER'S DAY IN SIXTEEN SUCCESSIVE ICE CREAMS ALTERNATED WITH TEN GLASSES OF EQUALLY COLD SODA WATER AND WHO RELATED THIS EXCITING EXPERIENCE IN TURN TO EVERYBODY ON BOARD
YES AND THAT IS WIDE ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH AND SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE REPLIED KATY I FEEL AS IF I COULD SLEEP FOR A FORTNIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THE BAD NIGHTS AT SEA EVERYTHING SEEMED DELIGHTFUL TO HER THE SPACE FOR UNDRESSING
I THOUGHT I WAS NEVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE SQUEEZE OH MISS KATY IT HAS BEEN SO HORRID I NEVER THOUGHT THAT GOING TO EUROPE MEANT SUCH DREADFUL THINGS AS THIS THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
AND WHAT THEY SAID AND HOW THEY FELT THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF THIS UN EXCITING ROMANCE WAS GIVEN THAT FIRST AFTERNOON ON DECK AND AFTER THAT AMY CLAIMED A NEW CHAPTER DAILY AND IT WAS A CHIEF INGREDIENT OF HER PLEASURE DURING THE VOYAGE
OH WELL FOR THE FISHERMAN'S CHILD ON THE SANDY BEACH AT HIS PLAY
WITH WHOM SHE WAS A PRIME FAVORITE HE GAVE MISSUS ASHE AND HERSELF THE SEATS NEXT TO HIM AT TABLE LOOKED AFTER THEIR COMFORT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND EACH NIGHT AT DINNER SENT KATY ONE OF THE APPLE DUMPLINGS MADE SPECIALLY FOR HIM BY THE COOK
IT WAS ALL LIKE A BAD DREAM AND THEY CALL THIS TRAVELLING FOR PLEASURE THOUGHT POOR KATY ONE DROLL THING HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECOND NIGHT AT LEAST IT SEEMED DROLL AFTERWARD AT THE TIME KATY WAS TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO ENJOY IT
FOR THE DINNER I ATE ON THE SHORE SO LATE HAS VANISHED INTO THE SEA LAUGHTER IS VERY RESTORATIVE AFTER THE FORLORNITY OF SEA SICKNESS AND KATY WAS SO STIMULATED BY HER LETTER THAT SHE MANAGED TO STRUGGLE INTO HER DRESSING GOWN AND SLIPPERS
I NEVER KNEW HER SO NAUGHTY AND IT SEEMED VERY NEGLECTFUL NOT TO COME TO SEE AFTER YOU POOR DEAR CHILD BUT REALLY I COULDN'T RAISE MY HEAD NEITHER COULD I AND I FELT JUST AS GUILTY NOT TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU SAID KATY WELL
THEY NOW SEEMED TO BE ACTING IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REALLY LOOKED ALIVE AS THEY BUMPED AND TROTTED SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BY TWO IN AT THE DOOR AND UP CLOSE TO HER BEDSIDE THERE THEY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS EXECUTING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DANCE
LOOKING LONGINGLY BACKWARD TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND FISHING OUT OF HER PORT HOLE WITH A CROOKED PIN IN HOPES OF GRAPPLING THE SUBMARINE CABLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE TO HER FAMILY TO COME OUT AT ONCE AND TAKE HER HOME
LITTLE GRETCHEN HAS HAD TO GO WITHOUT ANYTHING AND SHE HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND PATIENT KATY LOST NO TIME BUT RAN FOR MISSUS BARRETT WHOSE INDIGNATION KNEW NO BOUNDS WHEN SHE HEARD HOW THE HELPLESS PARTY HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
HER EYES FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DIM LINE OF THE IRISH COAST AN EXCITING AND INTERESTING DAY FOLLOWED AS AFTER STOPPING AT QUEENSTOWN TO LEAVE THE MAILS THEY SPED NORTHEASTWARD BETWEEN SHORES WHICH GREW MORE DISTINCT AND BEAUTIFUL WITH EVERY HOUR
WHEN SHE WOKE THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHE FELT BETTER THE STEWARDESS OPENED THE PORT HOLE TO FRESHEN THE AIR AND HELPED HER TO WASH HER FACE AND SMOOTH HER TANGLED HAIR THEN SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE BASIN OF GRUEL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF TOAST
AND SEATED HER ON DECK IN A CHAIR WITH A GREAT RUG WRAPPED ABOUT HER FEET WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT ON KATY'S PART THEN SHE DIVED DOWN THE COMPANION WAY AGAIN AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR APPEARED ESCORTING A BIG BURLY STEWARD
NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND KATY OPENING HER EYES SAW A PROCESSION OF BOOTS AND SHOES OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN LEFT ON THE FLOORS OR AT THE DOORS OF VARIOUS STATEROOMS AND WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LURCHINGS OF THE VESSEL HAD COLLECTED IN THE CABIN
I HATE BEING AT SEA KATY HEARD HER SAY I WON'T STAY IN THIS NASTY OLD SHIP
BUT THIS HORRIBLE SHIP KEEPS ON AND IS NEVER A MOMENT STILL AND I YEARN FOR THE TOUCH OF THE NICE DRY LAND WHERE I NEEDN'T FEEL SO ILL BREAK BREAK BREAK THERE IS NO GOOD LEFT IN ME
THEN THE LEADING SHOE TURNED ON ITS HEEL AS IF GIVING A SIGNAL TO THE OTHERS AND THEY ALL HOPPED SLOWLY AGAIN INTO THE PASSAGE WAY AND DISAPPEARED IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES KATY WROTE TO CLOVER AFTERWARD
THAT I NEEDED HER LESS THAN THE OTHERS BUT MY MAID HAS BEEN SICK TOO AND OH SO SELFISH SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE BABY INTO THE BERTH WITH HER AND I HAVE HAD ALL I COULD DO TO MANAGE WITH HIM WHEN I COULDN'T LIFT UP MY HEAD
KATY AND HE GREW QUITE INTIMATE DURING THEIR LONG MORNING TALK THE CAPTAIN LIKED GIRLS HE HAD ONE OF HIS OWN ABOUT KATY'S AGE AND WAS FOND OF TALKING ABOUT HER LUCY WAS HIS MAINSTAY AT HOME HE TOLD KATY
THEN A BOX OF QUININE PILLS THEN A SACHET FOR HER TRUNK THEN ANOTHER BURLESQUE POEM LAST OF ALL A CAKE OF DELICIOUS VIOLET SOAP TO WASH THE SEA SMELL FROM HER HANDS THE LABEL SAID
AND TO BRING HOME AND FRIENDS A GREAT DEAL NEARER WITH A HALF HAPPY HALF TEARFUL PLEASURE KATY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT DISTANCE COUNTS FOR LITTLE IF PEOPLE LOVE ONE ANOTHER
IT ENDED WITH THIS SHORT POEM OVER WHICH KATY LAUGHED TILL MISSUS ASHE CALLED FEEBLY ACROSS THE ENTRY TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER BREAK BREAK BREAK AND MIS BEHAVE O SEA AND I WISH THAT MY TONGUE COULD UTTER THE HATRED I FEEL FOR THEE
THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS FOR SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SLEEP EXCEPT IN BROKEN SNATCHES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED AND SHE LOOKED THROUGH THE LITTLE ROUND PANE OF GLASS IN THE PORT HOLE ONLY GRAY SKY AND GRAY WELTERING WAVES AND FLYING SPRAY AND RAIN MET HER VIEW
THE HISTORY OF VIOLET AND EMMA
THERE THE CAPTAIN FOUND HER AND DREW NEAR FOR A TALK CAPTAIN BRYCE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEA CAPTAIN THAT IS FOUND IN STORY BOOKS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN REAL LIFE HE WAS STOUT AND GRIZZLED AND BROWN AND KIND
AMY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AT LAST AND MUST NOT BE WAKED UP SO THEIR INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN WHISPERS MISSUS ASHE HAD BY NO MEANS GOT TO THE TEA AND TOAST STAGE YET AND WAS FEELING MISERABLE ENOUGH
AND ENJOYED THE JOKE AS MUCH AS ANY ONE AS SHE PRESENTED HERSELF EACH DAY WITH THE INVARIABLE FORMULA A LETTER FOR YOU MA'AM OR A BUNDLE MISS COME BY THE PARCELS DELIVERY ON THE FOURTH MORNING IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF BABY ROSE IN A LITTLE FLAT MOROCCO CASE
SHE MUST BE A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU SAID KATY SYMPATHETICALLY FOR THE CAPTAIN'S HEARTY VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THE COLOR OF LUCY'S HAIR AND EYES AND EXACTLY HOW TALL SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE HAD STUDIED AND WHAT SORT OF BOOKS SHE LIKED
THE WORST IS OVER WITH ALL OF US I HOPE THE VESSEL DOESN'T PITCH HALF SO MUCH NOW AND THE STEWARDESS SAYS WE SHALL FEEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER AS SOON AS WE GET ON DECK SHE IS COMING PRESENTLY TO HELP ME UP AND WHEN AMY WAKES WON'T YOU LET HER BE DRESSED
ON THE WHOLE KATY PREFERRED TO HAVE HER OWN SIDE OF THE SHIP THE DOWNWARD ONE FOR IT WAS LESS DIFFICULT TO KEEP HERSELF IN THE BERTH FROM WHICH SHE WAS IN CONTINUAL DANGER OF BEING THROWN
DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD I DO AND THEN CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SOBS BUT NEVER A SOUND FROM MISSUS ASHE WHO KATY SUSPECTED WAS TOO ILL TO SPEAK
AMID THE RUSH OF THE WIND THE CREAKING OF THE SHIP'S TIMBERS AND THE SHRILL BUZZ OF THE SCREW SHE HEARD A SOUND OF QUEER LITTLE FOOTSTEPS IN THE ENTRY OUTSIDE OF HER OPEN DOOR HOPPING AND LEAPING TOGETHER IN AN ODD IRREGULAR WAY LIKE A REGIMENT OF MICE OR TOY SOLDIERS
MEANWHILE EVERY MORNING BROUGHT A FRESH SURPRISE FROM THAT DEAR PAINSTAKING ROSE WHO HAD EVIDENTLY WORKED HARD AND THOUGHT HARDER IN CONTRIVING PLEASURES FOR KATY'S FIRST VOYAGE AT SEA MISSUS BARRETT WAS ENLISTED IN THE PLOT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THAT
AND WHEN THE WORDS CAME THEY WERE STRANGLED WITH SOBS
THE VERY IDEA OF WHICH WAS SIMPLY DREADFUL AND PRONOUNCED THE OTHER LADY ORRIDLY ILL WORSE THAN YOU ARE MISS AND THE LITTLE GIRL
LET US HAVE A HANSOM I NEVER SAW ONE AND THEY LOOK SO NICE IN PUNCH SO A HANSOM CAB WAS CALLED THE TWO LADIES GOT IN AMY CUDDLED DOWN BETWEEN THEM THE FOLDING DOORS WERE SHUT OVER THEIR KNEES LIKE A LAP ROBE
THERE WAS THE BAD LITTLE BOY WHOSE PARENTS WERE POWERLESS TO OPPOSE HIM AND WHO CARRIED TERROR TO THE HEARTS OF ALL BEHOLDERS WHENEVER HE APPEARED AND THE PRETTY WIDOW WHO FILLED THE ROLE OF REIGNING BELLE AND THE OTHER WIDOW NOT QUITE SO PRETTY OR SO MUCH A BELLE
THERE'S A SIGNAL WE'VE ARRANGED WHICH MEANS ALL'S WELL AND WHEN WE GET UP THE RIVER A LITTLE WAY I ALWAYS LOOK TO SEE IF IT'S FLYING IT'S A BIT OF A TOWEL HUNG FROM A PARTICULAR WINDOW AND WHEN I SEE IT I SAY TO MYSELF THANK GOD ANOTHER VOYAGE SAFELY DONE AND NO HARM COME OF IT
OH DEAR WHY DO PEOPLE EVER GO TO SEA UNLESS THEY MUST SHE THOUGHT FEEBLY TO HERSELF SHE WANTED TO GET UP AND SEE HOW MISSUS ASHE HAD LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE ATTEMPT TO MOVE MADE HER SO MISERABLY ILL THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SINK AGAIN ON HER PILLOWS
ALL DAY YESTERDAY WHEN SHE WASN'T SICK
FOUND HERSELF TOO DIZZY AND ILL TO SIT UP A MOMENT LONGER AND THANKFULLY RESORTED TO HER OWN AS THE NIGHT CAME ON THE WIND GREW STRONGER AND THE MOTION WORSE THE SPARTACUS HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A DREADFUL ROLLER
OH CRIED KATY WITH HORROR NOTHING TO EAT SINCE YESTERDAY HOW DID IT HAPPEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SICK ON OUR SIDE THE SHIP EXPLAINED THE POOR LADY AND I SUPPOSE THE STEWARDESS THOUGHT AS I HAD A MAID WITH ME
AND KATY FOUND THAT HER APPETITE WAS COME AGAIN AND SHE COULD EAT AND ERE'S A LETTER MA'AM WHICH HAS COME FOR YOU BY POST THIS MORNING SAID THE NICE OLD STEWARDESS PRODUCING AN ENVELOPE FROM HER POCKET
EITHER THEY SHOULD ALL GET TO LAND OR ALL GO TO THE BOTTOM AND BE DROWNED AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE DIDN'T CARE VERY MUCH WHICH IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE GALE INCREASED AS THE DAY WORE ON AND THE VESSEL PITCHED DREADFULLY TWICE KATY WAS THROWN OUT OF HER BERTH ON THE FLOOR
OF THIS FACT KATY SOON HAD AUDIBLE PROOF FOR AS HER DIZZY SENSES RALLIED A LITTLE SHE COULD HEAR AMY IN THE OPPOSITE STATEROOM CRYING AND SOBBING PITIFULLY SHE SEEMED TO BE ANGRY AS WELL AS SICK FOR SHE WAS SCOLDING HER POOR MOTHER IN THE MOST VEHEMENT FASHION
THE FIFTH BROUGHT A WONDERFUL EPISTLE FULL OF STARTLING PIECES OF NEWS NONE OF THEM TRUE ON THE SIXTH APPEARED A LONG NARROW BOX CONTAINING A FOUNTAIN PEN THEN CAME MISTER HOWELLS'S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION WHICH KATY HAD NEVER SEEN
THE GREAT TUB OF FRESH WATER WHICH STOOD BESIDE THE ENGLISH LOOKING WASHSTAND WITH ITS AMPLE BASIN AND EWER THE CHINTZ CURTAINED BED THE COOLNESS THE SILENCE AND SHE CLOSED HER EYES WITH THE PLEASANT THOUGHT IN HER MIND
BUT ROSE'S FORETHOUGHT HAD GONE SO FAR EVEN AS TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA PARCEL IN CASE THE VOYAGE WAS A DAY LONGER THAN USUAL AND MISS CARR'S MAIL CONTINUED TO COME IN TILL THE VERY LAST MORNING KATY NEVER FORGOT THE THRILL THAT WENT THROUGH HER WHEN AFTER SO MANY DAYS OF SEA
PERHAPS SHE HASN'T NOTICED IT AT ALL DEAR ME HOW GOOD SOMETHING SMELLS I WISH THEY WOULD BRING US SOMETHING TO EAT A GOOD MANY PASSENGERS HAD COME UP BY THIS TIME AND ROBERT THE DECK STEWARD WAS GOING ABOUT TRAY IN HAND TAKING ORDERS FOR LUNCH
BUT WHICH IN REALITY LASTED MUCH LONGER IT MIGHT WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY HAVE BEEN CALLED THE ADVENTURES OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVENTURES FOR NOTHING IN PARTICULAR HAPPENED TO EITHER VIOLET OR EMMA DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR LONG DRAWN OUT HISTORY
WHO HAD GONE MANY VOYAGES WITH THE CAPTAIN AND KNEW HIS FANCIES KATY DID NOT CARE PARTICULARLY FOR THE DUMPLING BUT SHE VALUED IT AS A MARK OF REGARD AND ALWAYS ATE IT WHEN SHE COULD
YES M BY POST M'M WITHDREW AND LEFT KATY TO ENJOY THE LITTLE SURPRISE THE LETTER WAS NOT LONG BUT IT WAS VERY LIKE ITS WRITER ROSE DREW A PICTURE OF WHAT KATY WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING AT THE TIME IT REACHED HER
AND THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER FOR TEN DAYS CAN MELT AWAY INTO SPACE AND DISAPPEAR AS THOUGH THE BRIEF INTIMACY HAD NEVER EXISTED FOUR WHEELER OR HANSOM MA'AM SAID A PORTER TO MISSUS ASHE WHICH KATY OH
SHE COULDN'T ANSWER SHE WAS TOO ILL EXPLAINED KATY WELL MY PET IT WAS PRETTY HARD FOR YOU I HOPE WE SHA'N'T HAVE ANY MORE SUCH DAYS THE SEA IS A GREAT DEAL SMOOTHER NOW MABEL LOOKS QUITE PALE
AT THE LIVERPOOL DOCKS WE SHALL MEET AGAIN IN LONDON OR IN PARIS SAID ONE TO ANOTHER AND CARDS AND ADDRESSES WERE EXCHANGED THEN AFTER A BRIEF DELAY AT THE CUSTOM HOUSE THEY SEPARATED EACH TO HIS OWN PARTICULAR DESTINATION
A PICTURE SO NEAR THE TRUTH THAT KATY FELT AS IF ROSE MUST HAVE THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ESPECIALLY AS SHE KINDLY ILLUSTRATED THE SITUATION WITH A SERIES OF PEN AND INK DRAWINGS IN WHICH KATY WAS DEPICTED AS PRONE IN HER BERTH REFUSING WITH HORROR TO GO TO DINNER
AND THAT HEARTS HAVE A TELEGRAPH OF THEIR OWN WHOSE MESSAGES ARE AS SURE AND SWIFT AS ANY OF THOSE SENT OVER THE MATERIAL LINES WHICH LINK CONTINENT TO CONTINENT AND SHORE WITH SHORE LATER IN THE MORNING
IT'S A SAD KIND OF WORK FOR A MAN TO GO OFF FOR A TWENTY FOUR DAYS CRUISE LEAVING A SICK WIFE ON SHORE BEHIND HIM IF IT WASN'T THAT I HAVE LUCY TO LOOK AFTER THINGS I SHOULD HAVE THROWN UP MY COMMAND LONG AGO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU HAVE LUCY
IT WASN'T A BIT KIND OF YOU TO BRING ME TO SUCH A HORRID PLACE IT WAS VERY UNKIND IT WAS CRU EL I WANT TO GO BACK MAMMA TELL THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE ME BACK TO THE LAND MAMMA WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK TO ME OH I AM SO SICK AND SO VERY UN HAPPY
AND THE SPARTACUS BEGAN TO PITCH AND TOSS IN A MANNER WHICH MADE ALL HER UNSEASONED PASSENGERS GLAD TO BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THEIR BERTHS MISSUS ASHE AND AMY WERE AMONG THE EARLIEST VICTIMS OF SEA SICKNESS AND KATY AFTER HELPING THEM TO SETTLE IN THEIR STATEROOMS
NOT A SAILOR UNDER HIM WOULD HAVE DARED DISPUTE HIS ORDERS FOR A MOMENT BUT HE WAS VERY POPULAR WITH THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THEY LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY FEARED HIM FOR THEY KNEW HIM TO BE THEIR BEST FRIEND IF IT CAME TO SICKNESS OR TROUBLE WITH ANY OF THEM
CHAPTER FOUR ON THE SPARTACUS THE ULSTER AND THE FELT HAT SOON CAME OFF AGAIN FOR A HEAD WIND LAY WAITING IN THE OFFING
A GREAT SEA GOING STEAMER IS A LITTLE WORLD IN ITSELF AND GIVES ONE A GLIMPSE OF ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE AND CHARACTERS ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE SPARTACUS WHOM KATY LIKED SO WELL AS SEDATE LITTLE GRETCHEN EXCEPT THE DEAR OLD CAPTAIN
HE HAD A BLUFF WEATHER BEATEN FACE LIT UP WITH A PAIR OF SHREWD BLUE EYES WHICH TWINKLED WHEN HE WAS PLEASED AND HIS MANNER THOUGH IT WAS FULL OF THE HABIT OF COMMAND WAS QUIET AND PLEASANT HE WAS A MARTINET ON BOARD HIS SHIP
THEN THE STEWARDESS CAME AND FIXED A SORT OF MOVABLE SIDE TO THE BERTH WHICH HELD HER IN BUT MADE HER FEEL LIKE A CHILD FASTENED INTO A RAILED CRIB AT INTERVALS SHE COULD STILL HEAR AMY CRYING AND SCOLDING HER MOTHER AND CONJECTURED THAT THEY WERE HAVING A DREADFUL TIME OF IT IN THE OTHER STATEROOM
ALL THE TIME THAT SHE TALKED MISSUS BARRETT WAS BUSY IN MAKING MISSUS WARE FOR THAT IT SEEMED WAS THE SICK LADY'S NAME MORE COMFORTABLE AND KATY WAS FEEDING GRETCHEN OUT OF A BIG BOWL FULL OF BREAD AND MILK WHICH ONE OF THE STEWARDS HAD BROUGHT
IF YOU WOULD GIVE MY LITTLE GIRL SOMETHING TO EAT SHE HAS HAD NOTHING SINCE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE BEEN SO ILL AND NO
AND AWAY THEY DROVE UP THE SOLIDLY PAVED STREETS TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SEE OR DO ANYTHING BUT ENJOY THE SENSE OF BEING ON FIRM LAND ONCE MORE HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO SLEEP IN A BED THAT DOESN'T TIP OR ROLL FROM SIDE TO SIDE SAID MISSUS ASHE
THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT SEEM TO BE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD SHE HAD TWO PIG TAILS OF THICK FLAXEN HAIR HANGING OVER HER SHOULDERS AND AT KATY'S APPROACH RAISED A PAIR OF SOLEMN BLUE EYES WHICH HAD SO MUCH APPEAL IN THEM THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
WHOM EVERYBODY ON BOARD RATHER PITIED THERE WAS THE OTHER GIRL ON HER WAY TO STUDY ART WHO WAS TRAVELLING QUITE ALONE AND SEEMED TO HAVE NOBODY TO MEET HER OR TO GO TO EXCEPT A FELLOW STUDENT OF HER OWN AGE ALREADY IN PARIS BUT WHO SEEMED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HER LONELY POSITION
LONG HE STUDIED BEFORE HE MADE QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS THERE AT LAST HE SHUT THE GLASS WITH A SATISFIED AIR IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SAID TO KATY WHO STOOD NEAR ALMOST AS MUCH INTERESTED AS HE LUCY NEVER FORGETS BLESS HER
DOWN DOWN DOWN THE GREAT HULL WOULD SLIDE TILL KATY WOULD HOLD HER BREATH WITH FEAR LEST IT MIGHT NEVER RIGHT ITSELF AGAIN THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY THE TURN WOULD BE MADE AND UP UP UP IT WOULD GO TILL THE CANT ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS EQUALLY ALARMING
AND OTHERS NOT SO PLEASANT PERHAPS WHO WERE RATHER CURIOUS AND INTERESTING TO WATCH KATY GREW TO FEEL AS IF SHE KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER FELLOW TRAVELLERS AS TIME WENT ON THERE WAS THE YOUNG GIRL GOING OUT TO JOIN HER PARENTS UNDER THE CARE OF A SEVERE GOVERNESS
THE LITTLE UNCOMPLAINING THING WAS EVIDENTLY HALF STARVED BUT WITH THE MOUTHFULS THE PINK BEGAN TO STEAL BACK INTO HER CHEEKS AND LIPS
WHO CARRIED POOR LITTLE PALE AMY IN HIS ARMS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A KITTEN AMY GAVE A SCREAM OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF KATY AND CUDDLED DOWN IN HER LAP UNDER THE WARM RUG WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
IT CONTAINED A PRETTY LITTLE GREEN BOUND COPY OF EMERSON'S POEMS WITH KATY'S NAME AND TO BE READ AT SEA WRITTEN ON THE FLYLEAF SOMEHOW THE LITTLE GIFT SEEMED TO BRIDGE THE LONG MISTY DISTANCE WHICH STRETCHED BETWEEN THE VESSEL'S STERN AND BOSTON BAY
AND COMPETENT TO GRAPPLE WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THERE WAS THE QUEER OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CROSSED ELEVEN TIMES BEFORE AND HAD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCE TO SPARE FOR ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN NOT SO OLD BUT EVEN MORE QUEER
SO IT PROVED FOR AFTER THESE TWO BAD DAYS NONE OF THE PARTY WERE SICK AGAIN DURING THE VOYAGE AMY HAD A CLAMOROUS APPETITE FOR STORIES AS WELL AS FOR COLD BEEF AND TO APPEASE THIS CRAVING KATY STARTED A SORT OF OCEAN SERIAL CALLED
SHE HEARD THEM GOING DOWN THE CABIN BUT HOW IT ENDED OR WHETHER THE OWNERS OF THE BOOTS AND SHOES EVER GOT THEIR OWN PARTICULAR PAIRS AGAIN SHE NEVER KNEW TOWARD MORNING THE GALE ABATED THE SEA BECAME SMOOTHER AND SHE DROPPED ASLEEP
AMY HOWEVER FOUND THEM PERFECTLY ENCHANTING AND WAS NEVER WEARY OF HEARING HOW THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND CAME HOME AGAIN HOW THEY GOT INTO SCRAPES AND GOT OUT OF THEM HOW THEY MADE GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND BROKE THEM ABOUT THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND BIRTHDAY TREATS
ON THE THIRD MORNING KATY WOKE AND DRESSED SO EARLY THAT SHE GAINED THE DECK BEFORE THE SAILORS HAD FINISHED THEIR SCRUBBING AND HOLYSTONING SHE TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE COMPANION WAY AND SAT DOWN ON THE TOP STEP OF THE LADDER TO WAIT TILL THE DECK WAS DRY ENOUGH TO VENTURE UPON IT
AND AS A GENERAL THING NONE OF THEM EVER SAW ANY OF THE OTHERS AGAIN IT IS OFTEN THUS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FELLOW VOYAGERS AT SEA AND IT IS ALWAYS A SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY TO INEXPERIENCED TRAVELLERS THAT IT CAN BE SO
KATY GOING DOWN TO HER STATEROOM FOR SOMETHING CAME ACROSS A PALLID EXHAUSTED LOOKING LADY WHO LAY STRETCHED ON ONE OF THE LONG SOFAS IN THE CABIN WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND A LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT HER FEET QUITE STILL WITH A PAIR OF SMALL HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP
IT GREW TO BE ONE OF THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS OF SHIP LIFE TO WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THESE DAILY GIFTS AND WHAT DID THE MAIL BRING FOR YOU THIS TIME MISS CARR WAS A QUESTION FREQUENTLY ASKED EACH ARRIVAL KATY THOUGHT MUST BE THE FINAL ONE
AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER WHILE MISSUS BARRETT ATTENDS TO YOU I DON'T THINK I CAN BE DRESSED SIGHED POOR MISSUS ASHE
WHERE SHE SAT IN THE DEEP GRASS AND LOOKED AT THOSE THREE LONG MOUNDS AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND LIFE DEEPER STILL TO FATHOM DEATH SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOW KATE TRIED AS NEVER BEFORE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHERE
AND WHEN SHE COULD FIND NO MORE TO DO TOOK LITTLE POLL IN HER ARMS AND WENT OUT IN THE FIELDS TO ADAM WHERE SHE FOUND THE BABY A SAFE PLACE AND THEN CUT AND HUSKED CORN AS USUAL EVERY SABBATH AND OFTEN DURING THE WEEK HER FEET CARRIED HER TO THE CEMETERY
THEY ALL KNEW HOW SHE COULD WORK AND WHAT SHE COULD GIVE IF SHE CHOSE WHILE THAT SHE HAD STOOD AT THE ALTAR AND BEEN BAPTIZED MEANT THAT SOMETHING NOT CUSTOMARY WITH THE BATES FAMILY WAS TAKING PLACE IN HER HEART
THE THING THAT HOLDS ME AND FASCINATES ME AND THAT I HAVE SUCH A TIME BEING SURE OF IS WHERE ROBERT GLANCED UPWARD AND ASKED ISN'T THERE ROOM ENOUGH UP THERE KATE TOO MUCH SAID KATE
SHE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE HAD HEARD RAN TO GET THE BABY AND MET HIM AT THE GATE ON THE WAY SHE SAID YOU TAKE THE BABY WHEN WE GET THERE AND IF I'M NEEDED TAKE HER BACK AND GET MILLY AND HER MOTHER TO COME STAY WITH YOU YOU KNOW WHERE HER THINGS ARE AND HOW TO FEED HER
SHE SANG SHE LAUGHED SHE WAS UNSPEAKABLY HAPPY SHE KEPT SAYING OVER AND OVER AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM
THEN SHE SAT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN AND LOOKED AT HIM FINALLY HE ASKED STILL HUNTING THE WHY KATE WHY DOESN'T SO MUCH MATTER SAID KATE AS WHERE I'M ENOUGH OF A FATALIST TO BELIEVE THAT MOTHER IS HERE BECAUSE SHE WAS OLD AND WORN OUT
WHILE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN WERE CARRYING A LIMP FORM ACROSS THE MEADOW TOWARD THE HOUSE AS THEIR CAR STOPPED KATE KISSED THE BABY MECHANICALLY HANDED HER TO ADAM AND RAN INTO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE DRAGGED A COUCH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST ROOM SHE ENTERED
AND SET THE SYRUP WHERE IT WILL BOIL SLOWLY FOR SIX OR EIGHT MINUTES THEN STRAIN IT TILL CLEAR THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG THE BAG SHOULD NOT BE SQUEEZED WHILE THE SYRUP IS PASSING THROUGH IT OR IT WILL NOT BE CLEAR
SHE MERELY WENT ON WITH LIFE AS SHE ALWAYS HAD LIVED IT TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITY WHEN SHE WAS SO NUMBED WITH GRIEF SHE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE KEPT HERSELF DRIVEN ABOUT THE HOUSE
KATE TURNED AND PLACING THE BABY ON THE FRONT SEAT SHE KNELT AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND THE LITTLE THING BUT HER LIPS ONLY REPEATED THE WORDS PRAISE THE LORD FOR THIS PRECIOUS BABY HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH HIGH RESOLVE SHE WOULD REAR THE BABY WITH SUCH CARE
THE LOW VINE BLACKBERRIES WILL NOT ANSWER FOR SYRUP AS THEY DO NOT POSSESS THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF THE HIGH VINE BLACKBERRIES SET THEM ON A MODERATE FIRE AND LET THEM SIMMER TILL THEY BREAK TO PIECES
PUT THE DUMPLINGS IN A POT OF BOILING WATER AND BOIL THEM AN HOUR WITHOUT ANY INTERMISSION IF ALLOWED TO STOP BOILING THEY WILL BE HEAVY SERVE THEM UP WITH PUDDING SAUCE OR BUTTER AND SUGAR
HE LEARNS TO COVET BY SEEING STRONGER MEN IN BETTER LOCATIONS SURPASS HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SO IF HE IS STRONG ENOUGH HE GOES AND ROBS THEM BY FORCE HE LEARNS THE DESIRE FOR THE CHASE IN FOOD HUNTING I THINK FOUR ARE PLENTY TO START WITH
IT IS ALSO A VERY PLEASANT SUMMER BEVERAGE
AND IT WENT DOWN AND TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER O GOD SAID KATE THEN AFTER AN INSTANT
CUT IT INTO PIECES JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO ENCLOSE ONE APPLE LAY THE APPLES ON THEM AND CLOSE THE CRUST TIGHT OVER THEM TIE THEM UP IN SMALL PIECES OF THICK CLOTH THAT HAS BEEN WELL FLOURED
KATE WENT SLOWLY UP THE WALK SHE STOPPED SEVERAL TIMES TO EXAMINE THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES CLOSELY TO WISH FOR RAIN FOR THE FLOWERS SHE SAT ON THE PORCH A FEW MINUTES TALKING TO LITTLE POLL THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO ANSWER THE PHONE KATE CRIED A SHARP VOICE
I MUST GO NOW SHALL I TAKE YOU HOME KATE GLANCED AT THE SUN AND SHOOK HER HEAD I CAN STAY HALF AN HOUR LONGER I DON'T MIND THE WALK I NEED EXERCISE TO KEEP ME IN CONDITION GOOD BYE AS HE STARTED HIS CAR HE GLANCED BACK
THEN STRAIN THEM THROUGH A FLANNEL CLOTH TO EACH PINT OF JUICE PUT A POUND OF WHITE SUGAR HALF AN OUNCE OF CINNAMON POWDERED FINE A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF FINELY POWDERED MACE
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO KATE THAT SHE HAD DONE AN UNPRECEDENTED THING SHE HAD DONE AS HER HEART DICTATED SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE PUT THE MINISTER INTO A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION WHEN HE FOLLOWED HER REQUEST TO BAPTIZE HER AND THE CHILD
OXFORD DUMPLINGS TAKE EIGHT OUNCES OF BISCUIT THAT IS POUNDED FINE
I'LL PHONE ROBERT AND COME AS SOON AS I CAN GET THERE KATE CALLED DOCTOR GRAY'S OFFICE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL
STRAIN IT FOR USE THIS SYRUP DOES VERY WELL TO PRESERVE FRUIT IN FOR COMMON USE
DROP THEM BY THE LARGE SPOONFUL INTO HOT LARD AND FRY THEM TILL A VERY LIGHT BROWN COLOR THEY ARE THE LIGHTEST FRIED IN A GREAT DEAL OF FAT
BUT SHE SPREAD THE TOWEL OVER WHAT HAD BEEN A FACE OF UNUSUAL BEAUTY ROBERT CAME IN A FEW MINUTES THEN ALL OF THEM WORKED UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS UNTIL HE SUDDENLY SANK TO THE FLOOR BURYING HIS FACE IN NANCY ELLEN'S BREAST THEN THEY KNEW
TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE PLAIN FRITTERS STIR A QUART OF MILK GRADUALLY INTO A QUART OF FLOUR PUT IN A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT AND SEVEN BEATEN EGGS
WHAT A MAN CANNOT DO I STILL BELIEVE IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL OH YES SAID KATE IF THERE IS ANY SUCH THING IN SCIENCE AS A SELF EVIDENT FACT THAT IS ONE THAT IS PROVABLE ROBERT LOOKED AT HER EAGER FACE
WHO DID NOT COME INTO THE WORLD WITH FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS THEY ALL REPRODUCE THEMSELVES THEY ALL MAKE SOMETHING INTENDED FOR MUSIC THEY ALL EXPRESS A FEELING IN THEIR HEARTS BY THE EXERCISE WE CALL DANCE THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE AFTER LIFE OF THE SOUL
BOTTLE CORK AND SEAL IT TIGHT THIS SYRUP IS VERY NICE TO FLAVOR PUDDINGS AND PIES THREE HUNDRED BLACKBERRY SYRUP PROCURE NICE HIGH VINE BLACKBERRIES THAT ARE PERFECTLY RIPE
I SUSPECT SHE WAS DRIVING WITH THE PICTURE IN ONE HAND OH MY GOD HAVE MERCY THEY HAD COME TO DEEP GROOVES IN LOOSE GRAVEL THEN THE CUT IN THE EMBANKMENT THEN THEY COULD SEE THE WRECKED CAR STANDING ON THE ENGINE AND LYING AGAINST A BIG TREE NEAR THE WATER
AND WHY THAT SOMETHING WAS MANY DAYS SHE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME THINKING AND AT LAST SHE ARRIVED AT FIXED CONVICTIONS THAT SETTLED MATTERS FOREVER WITH HER ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD ARRANGED THE FALL ROSES SHE HAD GROWN
SO THAT WAS A COMFORT TO KATE WHO TOOK TIME TO PITY HIM EVEN IN HER BLACKEST HOUR SHE HAD SOME VERY BLACK ONES SHE COULD HAVE WAILED AND LAMENTED AND RELINQUISHED ALL SHE HAD GAINED BUT SHE DID NOT
THIS BELIEF IS AS MUCH A PART OF ANY MAN EVER BORN IN ANY LOCATION AS HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET WHETHER HE BELIEVES HIS SOUL ENTERS A CAT AND WORKS BACK TO MAN AGAIN AFTER LONG TRANSMIGRATION OR GOES TO A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND AS OUR INDIANS
I WENT INSIDE AND JOINED I'M GOING TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I CAN AFTER THIS AND I'M GOING TO HELP WITH THE WORK OF RUNNING IT WELL I LIKE THAT CRIED ADAM INDIGNANTLY WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME GO WITH YOU
KATE SLIPPED HER ARM AROUND NANCY ELLEN AS THEY WALKED TO THE GATE YOU KNOW SAID NANCY ELLEN THE MORE I STUDY YOU THE LESS I KNOW ABOUT YOU USUALLY IT'S SICKNESS AND SORROW AND LOSING THEIR FRIENDS THAT BRING PEOPLE TO THE CONSOLATIONS OF THE CHURCH
THE NEIGHBOURS SILENTLY BEGAN TAKING AWAY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN USED WHILE MISSUS HOWE CHOSE HER WHITEST SHEET AND LAID IT ON A CHAIR NEAR ROBERT TWO DAYS LATER THEY LAID NANCY ELLEN BESIDE HER MOTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TRYING TO FACE THE PROBLEM OF LIFE WITHOUT HER
I SAW THE LIFE GO FROM HER AND GO ON AND ON I SAW HER BODY STAND ERECT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REACH HER AND PICK HER UP AFTER ITS PASSING THAT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T THINK OF QUESTIONING IT KATE SAID ROBERT
WHEN SOFT STIR IN THREE BEATEN EGGS A TABLE SPOONFUL OF FLOUR AND A QUARTER OF A POUND OF ZANTE CURRANTS GRATE IN HALF A NUTMEG AND DO UP THE MIXTURE INTO BALLS
TO CLARIFY SYRUP FOR SWEETMEATS PUT YOUR SUGAR INTO THE PRESERVING KETTLE TURN IN THE QUANTITY OF COLD WATER THAT YOU THINK WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE FRUIT THAT IS TO BE PRESERVED IN IT
AS SOON AS IT BOILS UP WELL TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE LET IT REMAIN FOR A MINUTE THEN TAKE OFF THE SCUM SET IT BACK ON THE FIRE AND LET IT BOIL A MINUTE THEN TAKE IT OFF AND SKIM IT AGAIN THIS OPERATION REPEAT TILL THE SYRUP IS CLEAR
SKIM IT CLEAR THEN LET IT SIMMER GENTLY EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG WHEN COOL BOTTLE CORK AND SEAL IT TIGHT AND KEEP IT IN A COOL PLACE
THAT WHEN YOU GET YOUR LITTLE CHILD SHE WILL LEAD YOU STRAIGHT WHERE MINE AS LED ME GOOD BYE AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND REMEMBER ME TO ROBERT NANCY ELLEN STOOD INTENTLY STUDYING THE PICTURE SHE HELD IN HER HAND THEN SHE LOOKED AT KATE SMILING WITH MISTY EYES
SO THEY WELCOMED HER AND PRAISED THE BEAUTY AND SWEETNESS OF THE BABY UNTIL KATE WENT OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE HER FACE GLOWING SLOWLY SHE WALKED HOME AND AS SHE REACHED THE VERANDA ADAM TOOK THE BABY BEEN TO THE CEMETERY HE ASKED
WHY SHOULD THE OTHERS BE REAL AND THAT A DREAM I DON'T THINK IT IS SAID ROBERT IT'S MY BIGGEST SELF EVIDENT FACT SAID KATE CONCLUSIVELY I NEVER HEARD ANY ONE ELSE SAY THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THEM AND THEY ARE PROVABLE
HAVE HIM BRING WHAT HE MIGHT NEED TO HOWE'S AND HURRY RUSH HIM THEN SHE RAN TO HER BELL AND RANG SO FRANTICALLY THAT ADAM CAME RUNNING KATE WAS AT THE LITTLE GARAGE THEY HAD BUILT AND HAD THE DOOR OPEN
ORANGE SYRUP SQUEEZE OUT THE JUICE OF FRESH ORANGES AND STRAIN IT TO A PINT OF THE JUICE PUT A POUND AND A HALF OF SUGAR SET IT ON A MODERATE FIRE WHEN THE SUGAR HAS DISSOLVED PUT IN THE PEEL OF THE ORANGES
FINALLY SHE PICKED UP A FINE SPECIMEN OF EACH OF THE ROSES AND SLOWLY DROPPED THEM ON HER FATHER'S GRAVE THERE

MOLASSES SYRUP FOR PRESERVING MIX EIGHT POUNDS OF LIGHT SUGAR HOUSE OR NEW ORLEANS MOLASSES EIGHT POUNDS OF WATER ONE POUND OF POWDERED CHARCOAL BOIL THE WHOLE TOGETHER TWENTY MINUTES
CREAM FRITTERS MIX A PINT AND A HALF OF WHEAT FLOUR WITH A PINT OF MILK BEAT SIX EGGS TO A FROTH AND STIR THEM INTO THE FLOUR GRATE IN HALF A NUTMEG THEN ADD A PINT OF CREAM
OR YOU NEVER WOULD BE GOING TO CHICAGO AFTER THIS LITTLE MOTHERLESS CHILD YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD BUT I KNOW FROM THE JOY OF YOU AND ROBERT DURING THE PAST MONTHS THAT MISSUS SOUTHEY ISN'T TROUBLING YOU ANY MORE AND I'M SURE ENOUGH TO PUT IT INTO WORDS
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE RATHER LIMITING MAN WHEN YOU NARROW HIM TO FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS OH I DON'T KNOW SAID KATE AIR TO BREATHE AND FOOD TO SUSTAIN ARE PRESUPPOSED MAN LEARNS TO FIGHT IN SELF DEFENSE AND TO ACQUIRE WHAT HE COVETS
YOU BORE THOSE THINGS LIKE A STOIC WHEN THEY ARE ALL OVER AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY JUST THE JOY OF BEING SURE OF LITTLE POLL HAS TRANSFORMED YOU KATE YOU MAKE ME THINK OF THE WINGED VICTORY THIS AFTERNOON
SHE WOULD JOIN IN WHATEVER EFFORT THE CHURCH WAS MAKING TO HOLD AND INCREASE ITS MEMBERSHIP AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO RAISE FUNDS TO KEEP UP THE ORGANIZATION ALL THE TIME HER MIND WAS BUSY THINKING OUT THESE FINE RESOLVES
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WITH THE FACT THAT HE ENTERS THIS WORLD WITH BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE OF SOME KIND WE SEE MATERIAL EVIDENCE IN INCREASE THAT MAN IS NOT DEFEATED IN HIS DESIRE TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF PROBATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS AND CATECHISMS SHE HAD READ THE BIBLE AS WAS THE CUSTOM EVERY MORNING BEFORE HER SCHOOL IN THAT BOOK WHEN A MAN WANTED TO FOLLOW JESUS HE FOLLOWED
EIGHT EGGS GRATE IN THE RIND OF TWO LEMONS AND THE JUICE AND APPLES DROP THE BATTER BY THE SPOONFUL INTO HOT LARD TAKING CARE TO HAVE A SLICE OF APPLE IN EACH FRITTER
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PICTURE THEY JUST CAME SAID NANCY ELLEN RATHER BREATHLESSLY I WAS WILD FOR THAT LITTLE DARLING AT ONCE I HAD ROBERT TELEGRAPH THEM TO HOLD HER UNTIL WE COULD GET THERE WE'RE GOING TO START ON THE EVENING TRAIN
NANCY ELLEN LOOKED AT KATE AND SMILED PECULIARLY I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY SHE SAID

FOUND A PILLOW AND BROUGHT A BUCKET OF WATER AND A TOWEL FROM THE KITCHEN THEY CARRIED NANCY ELLEN IN AND LAID HER DOWN KATE BEGAN UNFASTENING CLOTHING AND TRYING TO GET THE BROKEN BODY IN SHAPE FOR THE DOCTOR TO WORK UPON
ROBERT SAID NOTHING HE SEEMED TOO STUNNED TO THINK KATE WANTED TO TELL HIM OF HER FINAL VISIT WITH NANCY ELLEN BUT SHE COULD NOT AT THAT TIME ROBERT'S AGED MOTHER CAME TO HIM AND SAID SHE COULD REMAIN AS LONG AS HE WANTED HER
WE HAVE ADVANCED TO SOMETHING BETTER THAN TOM TOMS AND POW WOWS FOR MUSIC AND DANCE THESE DESIRES ARE FULFILLED BEFORE US NOW TELL ME WHY THE VERY STRONGEST OF ALL THE MOST DEEPLY ROOTED THE BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE SHOULD COME TO NOTHING
ADAM AND MILLY ARE GOING TO COME IN SOON I'M ALMOST SURE AT LEAST HE IS WILLING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT I AM TO DO BUT I SUPPOSE THEY WILL GIVE ME MY WORK SOON
AND SOME ROADSIDE ASTERS SHE HAD GATHERED IN PASSING SHE SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT WHEN A CAR STOPPED ON THE ROAD KATE LOOKED UP TO SEE ROBERT COMING ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD WITH HIS ARMS FULL OF GREENHOUSE ROSES
JESUS ACCEPTED HIM AND THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT WITH KATE THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK NANCY ELLEN CAME FLYING UP THE WALK ON WINGED FEET HERSELF SHE CARRIED PHOTOGRAPHS OF SEVERAL SMALL CHILDREN
KATE AROSE WITH THE BENEDICTION PICKED UP THE BABY AND STARTED DOWN THE AISLE AMONG THE PEOPLE SHE HAD KNOWN ALL HER LIFE ON EVERY SIDE STRONG HANDS STRETCHED OUT TO GREET AND WELCOME HER A DAUGHTER OF ADAM BATES WAS SOMETHING NEW AS A CHURCH MEMBER
BUT LESS GREASY IF FRIED IN JUST FAT ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM FROM STICKING TO THE FRYING PAN SERVE THEM UP WITH LIQUID PUDDING SAUCE
ELDERBERRY SYRUP WASH AND STRAIN THE BERRIES WHICH SHOULD BE PERFECTLY RIPE TO A PINT OF JUICE PUT A PINT OF MOLASSES BOIL IT TWENTY MINUTES STIRRING IT CONSTANTLY THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE WHEN COLD
AND DOWN TO THE ICE OF THE SOUTHERN POLE AGAIN AND IN BLACKEST AFRICA FARTHEST WILDEST BORNEO YOU WILL NEVER DISCOVER ONE SINGLE TRIBE OF CREATURES UPRIGHT AND BELONGING TO THE RACE OF MAN
AND WHAT IS THE SOUL AND HOW CAN IT BRIDGE THE VORTEX LYING BETWEEN US AND OTHER WORLDS THAT MAN NEVER CAN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AIR TO BREATHE AND SUPPORT HIM I DON'T KNOW SAID ROBERT AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I DO KNOW
YES SAID KATE RECOGNIZING A NEIGHBOUR LIVING A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD DID NANCY ELLEN JUST LEAVE YOUR HOUSE CAME A BREATHLESS QUERY YES SAID KATE AGAIN I JUST SAW A CAR THAT LOOKED LIKE HERS SLIP IN THE FRESH SAND AT THE RIVER LEVEE
IF I GET THIS DARLING LITTLE GIRL WILL SHE MAKE ME BIG AND SPLENDID AND FINE LIKE YOU KATE SUDDENLY DREW NANCY ELLEN TO HER AND KISSED HER A LONG HARD KISS ON THE LIPS NANCY ELLEN SHE SAID YOU ARE BIG AND SPLENDID AND FINE
OF THE SIZE OF AN EGG FRY THEM TILL A LIGHT BROWN
I ALWAYS BELIEVED THERE WAS SOMETHING BUT SINCE I SAW MOTHER GO I KNOW THERE IS SHE STOOD IN FULL EVENING LIGHT I LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER FACE AND ROBERT YOU KNOW I'M NO CREATURE OF FANCIES AND DELUSIONS I TELL YOU I SAW HER SOUL PASS
SHE WAS LEANING OVER THE FLOWERS ABSORBED IN THEIR BEAUTY KATE SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER UNTIL TIME TO HELP WITH THE EVENING WORK AND PREPARE SUPPER THEN SHE AROSE SHE STOOD LOOKING DOWN A LONG TIME
POLLY HAD A CLEAR CASE OF URIC POISON WHILE I'D STAKE MY LIFE NANCY ELLEN WAS GLOATING OVER THE PICTURE SHE CARRIED WHEN SHE RAN INTO THAT LOOSE SAND IN EACH OF THEIR CASES I AM SATISFIED AS TO WHY AS WELL AS ABOUT FATHER
PARE THIN THE RIND OF FRESH LEMONS SQUEEZE OUT THE JUICE AND TO A PINT OF IT WHEN STRAINED PUT A POUND AND THREE QUARTERS OF SUGAR AND THE RIND OF THE LEMONS DISSOLVE THE SUGAR BY A GENTLE HEAT
BEAT THE WHITES OF EGGS TO A FROTH ALLOWING ONE WHITE OF AN EGG TO THREE POUNDS OF SUGAR MIX THE WHITES OF THE EGGS WITH THE SUGAR AND WATER SET IT ON A SLOW FIRE AND LET THE SUGAR DISSOLVE THEN STIR THE WHOLE UP WELL TOGETHER
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT PROVING IT KATE HE ASKED WHY THIS WAY SAID KATE LEANING TO STRAIGHTEN AND ARRANGE THE DELICATE VELVET PETALLED ROSES WITH HER SURE WORK ABUSED FINGERS TAKE THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
BUT YOU WOULD WANT TO WAIT A LITTLE AND JOIN WITH MILLY WOULDN'T YOU SHE ASKED UNCLE ROBERT ALWAYS HAS BEEN A CHURCH MEMBER I THINK IT'S A FINE STAND FOR A MAN TO TAKE MAYBE THAT WOULD BE BETTER HE SAID I DIDN'T THINK OF MILLY
KATE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY ADAM SHE SAID WHEN I STARTED OUT I MEANT ONLY TO TAKE SOME FLOWERS TO MOTHER AND POLLY AS I CAME AROUND THE CORNER OF THE CHURCH TO TAKE THE FOOTPATH THEY WERE SINGING REJOICE IN THE LORD
HE CARRIED A BIG BUNCH OF DEEP RED FOR HER MOTHER WHITE FOR POLLY AND A LARGE SHEAF OF WARM PINK FOR NANCY ELLEN KATE KNELT UP AND TAKING HER FLOWERS SHE MOVED THEM LOWER AND SILENTLY HELPED ROBERT PLACE THOSE HE HAD BROUGHT
AND IF HER BLOOD SEEMS GOOD AND HER ANCESTORS RESPECTABLE AND SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT PICTURE WE'RE GOING TO BRING HER BACK WITH US OH KATE I CAN SCARCELY WAIT TO GET MY FINGERS ON HER I'M HUNGRY FOR A BABY ALL OF MY OWN KATE STUDIED THE PICTURE SHE'S CHARMING SHE SAID
KATE NODDED AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR THAT'S TOO FAR TO WALK AND CARRY THIS GREAT BIG WOMAN HE SAID SNUGGLING HIS FACE IN THE BABY'S NECK WHILE SHE PATTED HIS CHEEKS AND PULLED HIS HAIR WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WANTED TO GO AND LET ME GET OUT THE CAR
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRUNK FROM THEM NO SAID KATE SHE WASN'T SICK SHE WAS DRUNK DRUNKEN WITH JOY SHE HAD A PICTURE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BABY GIRL THEY WERE TO START TO CHICAGO AFTER HER TO NIGHT
I'M SURE MILLY WILL BE JOINING VERY SOON AND THAT SHE'LL WANT YOU WITH HER SAID KATE SHE WAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL WOMAN BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT DAY SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS MOVING WITH WINGED FEET
THEN A CARRIAGE DREW INTO THE LINE OF HER VISION STOPPED AT YORK'S GATE AND MISTER YORK ALIGHTED AND SWUNG TO THE GROUND A SLIM GIRLISH FIGURE AND THEN HELPED HIS WIFE KATE HAD A SUDDEN INSPIRATION
SHE WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH ADAM SHE WOULD MAKE HEROIC EFFORT TO HELP HIM TO CLEAN UNASHAMED MANHOOD SHE WOULD BE A BETTER SISTER TO ALL HER FAMILY SHE WOULD BE FRIENDLIER AND HAVE MORE PATIENCE WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
KEEP IT IN A COOL PLACE THIS MIXED WITH COLD WATER IN THE PROPORTION OF A WINE GLASS OF SYRUP TO TWO THIRDS OF A TUMBLER OF WATER IS AN EXCELLENT REMEDY FOR THE DYSENTERY AND SIMILAR COMPLAINTS
KATE SAT STARING DOWN THE ROAD SHE WAS SHOCKED SPEECHLESS AGAIN SHE HAD FOLLOWED AN IMPULSE WITHOUT THINKING OF ANY ONE BESIDES HERSELF USUALLY SHE COULD TALK BUT IN THAT INSTANT SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
APPLE DUMPLINGS PARE TART MELLOW APPLES TAKE OUT THE CORES WITH A SMALL KNIFE AND FILL THE HOLES WITH SUGAR MAKE GOOD PIE CRUST ROLL IT OUT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AN INCH THICK
A COUPLE OF TEA SPOONSFUL OF SALT STIR THE WHOLE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE CREAM GET WELL MIXED IN THEN FRY THE MIXTURE IN SMALL CAKES
KATE YOU ARE MAKING THIS PLACE LOOK FINE I USED TO SAY I'D RATHER DIE THAN COME BACK HERE TO LIVE BUT LATELY IT HAS BEEN GROWING SO ATTRACTIVE I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT HALF MY TIME AND WISHED I WERE THE OTHER HALF
MISSUS WHISTLER TOLD ROBERT WHEN SHE CALLED HIM IN ABOUT HER SIDE TUESDAY I CAN'T IMAGINE A BATES JOINING CHURCH IF THAT IS JOINING CHURCH IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD SAID KATE WE JUST LOVED DOING IT DIDN'T WE LITTLE POLL
THEN STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG WHEN LUKEWARM PUT IN THE BEATEN WHITES OF A COUPLE OF EGGS AND PUT IT ON THE FIRE AS SOON AS IT BOILS TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE AND SKIM IT TILL CLEAR THEN PUT IT ON THE FIRE AND LET IT BOIL TILL IT BECOMES A THICK SYRUP
I THINK KATE I'M VERY CLOSE IF I AM NOT REALLY WHERE YOU ARE THIS MINUTE SHE SAID THEN SHE STARTED HER CAR BUT SHE LOOKED BACK WAVING AND SMILING UNTIL THE CAR SWERVED SO THAT KATE CALLED AFTER HER DO DRIVE CAREFULLY NANCY ELLEN
DON'T YOU DARE LET THEM CHANGE ANY WAY I DO BABY KNOWS MILLY SHE WILL BE GOOD FOR HER AND FOR YOU YOU'LL BE CAREFUL OF COURSE MOTHER SAID ADAM HE CALLED HER ATTENTION TO THE ROAD LOOK AT THOSE TRACKS HE SAID WAS SHE SICK
APPLE FRITTERS TAKE FOUR OR FIVE TART MELLOW APPLES PARE AND CUT THEM IN SLICES AND SOAK THEM IN SWEETENED LEMON JUICE MAKE A BATTER OF A QUART OF MILK A QUART OF FLOUR
YONDER WAS THE FAMILIAR STABLE AND FROM ITS INTERIOR CAME THE BUSY HUM OF A CARPENTER SHOP ESTABLISHED THAT MORNING BY DUKE'S YOUNG MASTER IN ASSOCIATION WITH SAMUEL WILLIAMS AND HERMAN HERE CLOSE BY WERE THE QUIET REFUSE CAN
IT ROSE TO A WAIL AND ROSE AND ROSE AGAIN TILL IT SCREAMED LIKE A SMALL SIREN IT WAS GIPSY'S WAR CRY AND AT THE SOUND OF IT DUKE BECAME A FROTHING MANIAC
THUS BEING ASLEEP IN A NOOK BEHIND THE METAL REFUSE CAN WHEN THE STRANGE CAT VENTURED TO ASCEND THE STEPS OF THE PORCH HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO UNWARLIKE THAT THE CAT FELT ENCOURAGED TO EXTEND ITS FIELD OF RECONNAISSANCE
AND FROM ABOVE THE REMARKABLE EFFECT THUS PRODUCED SHOT THE INTOLERABLE GLARE OF TWO YELLOW EYES TO THE GAZE OF DUKE STILL BLURRED BY SLUMBER THIS MONSTROSITY WAS ALL OF ONE PIECE THE BONE SEEMED A LIVING PART OF IT
THIS STATELY AND DANGEROUS WALK OF HIS HIS LONG VIBRANT WHISKERS HIS SCARS HIS YELLOW EYE SO ICE COLD SO FIRE HOT HAUGHTY AS THE EYE OF SATAN GAVE HIM THE DEADLY AIR OF A MOUSQUETAIRE DUELLIST
NO GIPSY WAS NOT THE PET FOR A LITTLE GIRL THE ROSY HEARTHSTONE AND SHELTERED RUG WERE TOO CIRCUMSPECT FOR HIM SURROUNDED BY THE COMFORTS OF MIDDLE CLASS RESPECTABILITY
NEVER TO GET TO ANYWHERE AND NEVER TO LIE DOWN OR DIE IT WAS NO USE STOPPING TO LOOK ABOUT HER FOR WHAT HAD SHE TO DO BUT FOREVER LOOK ABOUT HER AS SHE WENT ON AND ON AND ON NEVER SEEING ANY THING AND NEVER EXPECTING TO SEE ANY THING
THOSE WHO ARE GOOD TEMPERED BECAUSE IT IS A FINE DAY WILL BE ILL TEMPERED WHEN IT RAINS THEIR SELVES ARE JUST THE SAME BOTH DAYS ONLY IN THE ONE CASE THE FINE WEATHER HAS GOT INTO THEM IN THE OTHER THE RAINY
AS NEVER TO NOTICE EITHER THAT THE FIRE WAS DYING OR THAT A HEAP OF FIR CONES LAY IN A CORNER NEAR IT SUDDENLY A GREAT WIND CAME ROARING DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND SCATTERED THE ASHES ABOUT THE FLOOR A TREMENDOUS RAIN FOLLOWED
HE WAS GIVEN TO MUSING BUT NOT TO AVOIDABLE ACTION AND HE SEEMED HABITUALLY TO HOPE FOR SOMETHING WHICH HE WAS PRETTY SURE WOULD NOT HAPPEN EVEN IN HIS SLEEP THIS GAVE HIM AN AIR OF WISTFULNESS
AND SHE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE COTTAGE THEREFORE SHE WOULD STAY WITH THE MOON STRANGE WAS IT NOT THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO LONG WITH THE WISE WOMAN AND YET KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT COTTAGE AS FOR THE MOON SHE DID NOT BY ANY MEANS KNOW THE WORST OF HER
HIS SOUL WAS IN THAT WALK AND IN THAT EYE IT COULD BE READ THE SOUL OF A BRAVO OF FORTUNE LIVING ON HIS WITS AND HIS VALOUR ASKING NO FAVOURS AND GRANTING NO QUARTER INTOLERANT PROUD SULLEN
SHE EVEN IMAGINED THAT THE MOON WAS SLOWLY COMING NEARER AND NEARER DOWN THE SKY TO TAKE HER AND FREEZE HER TO DEATH IN HER ARMS THE WISE WOMAN TOO SHE FELT SURE ALTHOUGH HER COTTAGE LOOKED ASLEEP WAS WATCHING HER AT SOME LITTLE WINDOW
SEEMINGLY THIS LEFT GAVE DUKE THREE LIGHTNING LITTLE PATS UPON THE RIGHT EAR BUT THE CHANGE IN HIS VOICE INDICATED THAT THESE WERE NO LOVE TAPS HE YELLED HELP AND BLOODY MURDER NEVER HAD SUCH A SHATTERING UPROAR ALL VOCAL
FOR THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO KNOCK UPON AND PERHAPS THE OLD WOMAN WOULD HEAR HER AND LIFT HER IN BY SOME WINDOW THEREUPON SHE ROSE AT ONCE TO HER FEET AND PICKING UP A STONE BEGAN TO KNOCK ON THE WALL WITH IT A LOUD NOISE WAS THE RESULT
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE WHITE FISH'S SPINAL COLUMN AND FLOPPING TAIL HAD INTERFERED WITH HIS VISION AND IN LAUNCHING HIMSELF HE MAY HAVE MISTAKEN THE DARK ROUND OPENING OF THE CISTERN FOR ITS DARK ROUND COVER
THE HUM OF THE CARPENTER SHOP CEASED AND SAM WILLIAMS APPEARED IN THE STABLE DOORWAY HE STARED INSANELY MY GORRY HE SHOUTED DUKE'S HAVIN A FIGHT WITH THE BIGGEST CAT YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE C'MON
BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE CAME ONLY TO ANOTHER BACK FOR NO DOOR WAS TO BE SEEN SHE TRIED THE FARTHER END BUT STILL NO DOOR SHE MUST HAVE PASSED IT AS SHE RAN BUT NO NEITHER IN GABLE NOR IN SIDE WAS ANY TO BE FOUND
THE ONLY SHADOW OF A HOPE SHE HAD WAS THAT SHE MIGHT BY SLOW DEGREES GROW THINNER AND THINNER UNTIL AT LAST SHE WORE AWAY TO NOTHING AT ALL ONLY ALAS SHE COULD NOT DETECT THE LEAST SIGN THAT SHE HAD YET BEGUN TO GROW THINNER
OR THAT IF ONE SHOULD DO SO IT WOULD THAT INSTANT WITHER UP AND CEASE IF AN ARMY OF THEM HAD RUSHED TO INVADE IT IT WOULD HAVE MELTED AWAY ON THE EDGE OF IT AND CEASED LIKE A DYING WAVE
THOUGH THAT WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE ON THE CONTRARY SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO BE ANGRY FOR WAS SHE NOT MOST DESPERATELY ILL USED AND A PRINCESS TOO BUT THE WIND HOWLED ON AND THE RAIN KEPT POURING DOWN THE CHIMNEY
WHICH CAME UP TO THE WALLS OF THE COTTAGE ON EVERY SIDE AND ROARED AND SCREAMED WITH RAGE SUDDENLY HOWEVER SHE REMEMBERED HOW HER SCREAMING HAD BROUGHT THE HORDE OF WOLVES AND HYENAS ABOUT HER IN THE FOREST AND CEASING AT ONCE LAY STILL
AND SHE FOUND SHE WAS KNOCKING ON THE VERY DOOR ITSELF FOR A MOMENT SHE FEARED THE OLD WOMAN WOULD BE OFFENDED BUT THE NEXT THERE CAME A VOICE SAYING WHO IS THERE THE PRINCESS ANSWERED
SOFT MOURNFUL TEARS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF RAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO WHICH SHE WAS SO MUCH USED AND ANOTHER VERY REMARKABLE THING
SHE THOUGHT HERSELF IT FELT LIKE THE OLD WOMAN'S CLOAK THAT SHE FELL BACK NOT ON THE FLOOR THOUGH BUT ON THE PATCH OF HEATHER WHICH FELT AS SOFT AND PLEASANT AS ANY BED IN THE PALACE THERE WORN OUT WITH WEEPING AND RAGE SHE SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP
SOMEHOW HELPED HER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GRIEF AT HAVING LOST HER AND NOT ONLY A GREAT LONGING TO BE BACK IN HER COMFORTABLE HOME BUT A FEEBLE FLUTTER OF GENUINE LOVE FOR HER PARENTS AWOKE IN HER HEART AS WELL AND SHE BURST INTO REAL TEARS
WHAT THAT EYE BEHELD WAS MONSTROUS HERE WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE THE HORRIFIC VISION IN THE MIDST OF THINGS SO ACCUSTOMED SUNSHINE FELL SWEETLY UPON PORCH AND BACKYARD
AFTER LOWERING A STICK OF WOOD INTO THE WATER TO SEASON IT ALL ABOUT DUKE WERE THESE USUAL AND REASSURING ENVIRONS OF HIS DAILY LIFE AND YET IT WAS HIS FATE TO BEHOLD RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND IN GHASTLY JUXTAPOSITION TO HIS FACE
THEREFORE ON SMALL ACCOUNTS HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE FIELD TO HIS ENEMIES AND TO CARRY THE FISHBONE ELSEWHERE HE TOOK TWO GIANT LEAPS THE FIRST LANDED HIM UPON THE EDGE OF THE PORCH
FIRST OF ALL THE SOFT WIND BLOWING GENTLY THROUGH THE DRY STALKS OF THE HEATHER AND ITS THOUSANDS OF LITTLE BELLS RAISED A SWEET RUSTLING WHICH THE PRINCESS TOOK FOR THE HISSING OF SERPENTS FOR YOU KNOW
PLEASE OLD WOMAN I DID NOT MEAN TO KNOCK SO LOUD TO THIS THERE CAME NO REPLY THEN THE PRINCESS KNOCKED AGAIN THIS TIME WITH HER KNUCKLES AND THE VOICE CAME AGAIN SAYING WHO IS THERE AND THE PRINCESS ANSWERED
STILL THINGS SEEMED TO BE GROWING RATHER WARM AND HE SAW NOTHING TO PREVENT HIS LEAVING AND THOUGH HE COULD LAUGH IN THE FACE OF SO UNEQUAL AN ANTAGONIST AS DUKE
ROSAMOND AS SHE SAT WARMING HERSELF BY THE GLOW OF THE PEAT FIRE TURNING OVER IN HER MIND ALL THAT HAD PASSED AND FEELING HOW PLEASANT THE CHANGE IN HER FEELINGS WAS BEGAN BY DEGREES TO THINK HOW VERY GOOD SHE HAD GROWN
OR ABLE TO DO HIMSELF FULL JUSTICE UNLESS HE COULD PERFORM THAT FELINE OPERATION INACCURATELY KNOWN AS SPITTING TO HIS NOTION THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT
THERE WAS NO MAGNIFYING GLASS BETWEEN HIM AND THIS SPINED AND SPIKY FACE INDEED DUKE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO THINK THE MATTER OVER QUIETLY IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
THE HOPELESSNESS GREW AT LENGTH SO UNENDURABLE THAT SHE WOKE WITH A START SEEING THE FACE OF THE WISE WOMAN BENDING OVER HER SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND HELD UP HER MOUTH TO BE KISSED
HOW WAS SHE TO DO THAT WHEN THERE WAS NO DOOR BUT AGAIN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF THAT IF SHE COULD NOT DO ALL SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD AT LEAST DO A PART OF IT IF SHE COULD NOT KNOCK AT THE DOOR SHE COULD AT LEAST KNOCK SAY ON THE WALL
A COTTAGE WITHOUT A DOOR SHE RUSHED AT IT IN A RAGE AND KICKED AT THE WALL WITH HER FEET BUT THE WALL WAS HARD AS IRON AND HURT HER SADLY THROUGH HER GAY SILKEN SLIPPERS
GIPSY HAD BECOME THOUGH TECHNICALLY NOT A WILDCAT UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST UNTAMED CAT AT LARGE IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD SUCH IN BRIEF WAS THE TERRIFYING CREATURE WHICH NOW ELONGATED ITS NECK
BEGAN TO SHOUT AND YELL AND CALL THE WISE WOMAN ALL THE BAD NAMES SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING AT HER NURSES BUT THERE CAME NOT A SINGLE SOUND IN REPLY
AND SUGGESTED THAT ATTENTION MIGHT WELL BE PAID DUKE
IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT FROM DUKE'S NOSE AND THE LITTLE DOG'S DREAMS BEGAN TO BE TROUBLED BY HIS OLFACTORY NERVE THIS FAITHFUL SENTINEL ON GUARD EVEN WHILE DUKE SLEPT SIGNALLED THAT ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS BY PARTIES UNKNOWN WERE TAKING PLACE
FOR THE COOK HAD BEEN CARELESS AND THE BACKBONE OF A THREE POUND WHITEFISH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE REFUSE CAN THIS CAT WAS FOR A CAT NEEDLESSLY TALL POWERFUL INDEPENDENT AND MASCULINE ONCE LONG AGO
AND HIS UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY SOON MADE HIM THE LEADER AND AT THE SAME TIME THE TERROR OF ALL THE LOOSE LIVED CATS IN A WIDE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE CONTRACTED NO FRIENDSHIPS AND HAD NO CONFIDANTS HE SELDOM SLEPT IN THE SAME PLACE TWICE IN SUCCESSION
THAT SHE JUMPED UP AND HURRIED ABOUT THE COTTAGE WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TRYING TO FIND THE WISE WOMAN BUT BEING IN A BAD TEMPER ALWAYS MAKES PEOPLE STUPID AND PRESENTLY SHE STRUCK HER FOREHEAD SUCH A BLOW AGAINST SOMETHING
AND THOUGH HE WAS WANTED BY THE POLICE HE WAS NOT FOUND IN APPEARANCE HE DID NOT LACK DISTINCTION OF AN OMINOUS SORT THE SLOW RHYTHMIC PERFECTLY CONTROLLED MECHANISM OF HIS TAIL AS HE IMPRESSIVELY WALKED ABROAD WAS INCOMPARABLY SINISTER
THERE WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE HE GATHERED HIS FUR SHEATHED MUSCLES CONCENTRATED HIMSELF INTO ONE BIG STEEL SPRING AND LAUNCHED HIMSELF SUPERBLY INTO SPACE HE MADE A STIRRING PICTURE HOWEVER BRIEF
AND ELEVATED HIS RIGHT ARM AFTER THE MANNER OF A SEMAPHORE THIS SEMAPHORE ARM REMAINED RIGID FOR A SECOND THREATENING THEN IT VIBRATED WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY FEINTING BUT IT WAS THE TREACHEROUS LEFT THAT DID THE WORK
I'M NOT AFRAID O THAT AND HE APPROACHED THE FISHBONE HIS PADDED FEET MAKING NO NOISE UPON THE BOARDS IT WAS A DESIRABLE FISHBONE LARGE WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE FISH'S TAIL STILL ATTACHED TO IT
AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FOR HER IN ITS GLOWING CAVERNS IT IS TRUE THAT IF THEY HAD BOTH BEEN IN TEARS BY HER SIDE BECAUSE OF HER NAUGHTINESS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CARED A STRAW BUT NOW HER OWN FORLORN CONDITION
AND A FEW OLD WOODEN CHAIRS A FIRE OF FIR WOOD ON THE HEARTH THE SMOKE OF WHICH SMELT SWEET AND A PATCH OF THICK GROWING HEATH IN ONE CORNER
BROKEN OUT UPON A PEACEFUL AFTERNOON GIPSY POSSESSED A VOCABULARY FOR CAT SWEARING CERTAINLY SECOND TO NONE OUT OF ITALY AND PROBABLY EQUAL TO THE BEST THERE WHILE DUKE REMEMBERED AND UTTERED THINGS HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF FOR YEARS
IF THE WOMAN WAS ANY THING SHORT OF AN OGRESS HER COTTAGE MUST BE BETTER THAN THAT HORRIBLE LONELINESS WITH NOTHING IN ALL THE WORLD BUT A STARE AND EVEN AN OGRESS HAD AT LEAST THE SHAPE AND LOOK OF A HUMAN BEING
SHE BEGAN TO WISH TO SEE THE WISE WOMAN AGAIN THE IDEA OF HER BEING AN OGRESS VANISHED UTTERLY AND SHE THOUGHT OF HER ONLY AS ONE TO TAKE HER IN FROM THE MOON AND THE LONELINESS AND THE TERRORS OF THE FOREST HAUNTED HEATH
AND HAS AN UNPLEASANT STARE I WILL LEAVE THIS SPOT AT ONCE ON THE CONTRARY DUKE WAS SO ELECTRIFIED BY HIS HORRID AWAKENING THAT HE COMPLETELY LOST HIS PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE VERY INSTANT OF HIS FIRST EYE'S OPENING
AND HIDE HER IN A COTTAGE WITH NOT EVEN A DOOR FOR THE HORRID WOLVES TO HOWL AGAINST BUT THE OLD WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS CALLED HER NOT KNOWING THAT HER REAL NAME WAS THE WISE WOMAN HAD TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST KNOCK AT THE DOOR
SHE FELT NO LITTLE SATISFACTION AS SHE SHUT THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND HER AND WHAT WITH THE SUFFERINGS AND TERRORS SHE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE THE NEW KIND OF TEARS SHE HAD SHED THE LOVE SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL FOR HER PARENTS AND THE TRUST SHE HAD BEGUN TO PLACE IN THE WISE WOMAN
IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF HER SOUL HAD GROWN LARGER OF A SUDDEN AND SHE HAD LEFT THE DAYS OF HER CHILDISHNESS AND NAUGHTINESS FAR BEHIND HER PEOPLE ARE SO READY TO THINK THEMSELVES CHANGED WHEN IT IS ONLY THEIR MOOD THAT IS CHANGED
WE HAVE HERE AN ANIMAL OF MOST PECULIAR AND UNATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE THOUGH UPON EXAMINATION IT SEEMS TO BE ONLY A CAT STEALING A FISHBONE NEVERTHELESS AS THE THIEF IS LARGE BEYOND ALL MY RECOLLECTION OF CATS
HE MADE A CONVULSIVE FRONTAL ATTACK UPON THE HOBGOBLIN AND THE MASSACRE BEGAN NEVER RELEASING THE FISHBONE FOR AN INSTANT GIPSY LAID BACK HIS EARS IN A CHILLING WAY BEGINNING TO SHRINK INTO HIMSELF LIKE A CONCERTINA
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN THE LIGHTNING BURST OUT AND THE THUNDER RUSHED AFTER IT AS IF THE GREAT LUMBERING SOUND COULD EVER THINK TO CATCH UP WITH THE SWIFT LIGHT AT LENGTH THE PRINCESS HAD AGAIN GROWN SO ANGRY FRIGHTENED AND MISERABLE ALL TOGETHER
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE HOWLING OF ITS WOLVES AND HYENAS AND WHO COULD TELL BUT SOME OF THEM MIGHT BREAK FROM THEIR COVERT AND SWEEP LIKE A SHADOW ACROSS THE HEATH
BUT RISING AMIDSHIPS SO HIGH THAT HE APPEARED TO BE GIVING AN IMITATION OF THAT PEACEFUL BEAST THE DROMEDARY SUCH WAS NOT HIS PURPOSE HOWEVER FOR HAVING ATTAINED HIS GREATEST POSSIBLE ALTITUDE HE PARTIALLY SAT DOWN
A LUMP OF DIRT STRUCK THE REFUSE CAN WITH VIOLENCE AND GIPSY BEHELD THE ADVANCE OF OVERWHELMING FORCES THEY RUSHED UPON HIM FROM TWO DIRECTIONS CUTTING OFF THE STEPS OF THE PORCH
THE OTHER EYE AND HIS MOUTH BEHAVED SIMILARLY THE LATTER LOOSING UPON THE QUIET AIR ONE SHRIEK OF MENTAL AGONY BEFORE THE LITTLE DOG SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND GAVE FURTHER EMPLOYMENT TO HIS VOICE IN A FRENZY OF PROFANITY
TO INCREASE HIS OWN OUTRAGEOUS CLAMOURS AND TO PRESS HOME HIS ATTACK BUT HE WAS ILL ADVISED THIS TIME IT WAS THE RIGHT ARM OF THE SEMAPHORE THAT DIPPED AND DUKE'S HONEST NOSE WAS BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN CONSEQUENCE
THAT THE FATHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL WHO OWNED HIM WAS ALMOST CONVINCING WHEN HE DECLARED THAT THE YOUNG CAT WAS HALF BRONCHO AND HALF MALAY PIRATE THOUGH IN THE LIGHT OF GIPSY'S LATER CAREER THIS SEEMS BITTERLY UNFAIR TO EVEN THE LOWEST ORDERS OF BRONCHOS AND MALAY PIRATES
AND AT LENGTH SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT TURN OUT THAT SHE WAS NO OGRESS BUT ONLY A RUDE ILL BRED TYRANNICAL YET ON THE WHOLE NOT ALTOGETHER ILL MEANING PERSON HARDLY HAD THE POSSIBILITY ARISEN IN HER MIND BEFORE SHE WAS ON HER FEET
AND HOW VERY GOOD SHE WAS TO HAVE GROWN GOOD AND HOW EXTREMELY GOOD SHE MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GROW SO VERY GOOD AS SHE NOW FELT SHE HAD GROWN AND SHE BECAME SO ABSORBED IN HER SELF ADMIRATION
BUT AS ALL CATS OF THE SLIGHTEST PRETENSIONS TO TECHNIQUE PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND IT CAN NEITHER BE WELL DONE NOR PRODUCE THE BEST EFFECTS UNLESS THE MOUTH BE OPENED TO ITS UTMOST CAPACITY
ROSAMOND THEN A SECOND TIME THERE WAS SILENCE BUT THE PRINCESS SOON VENTURED TO KNOCK A THIRD TIME WHAT DO YOU WANT SAID THE VOICE OH PLEASE LET ME IN SAID THE PRINCESS THE MOON WILL KEEP STARING AT ME
SO AS TO EXPOSE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL DOWN WHICH AT LEAST THAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE THREAT THE OPPOSING PARTY WILL SOON BE PASSING AND GIPSY COULD NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH WITHOUT RELINQUISHING HIS FISHBONE
LONG BEFORE HIS ADOLESCENCE HIS LACK OF DOMESTICITY WAS OMINOUS AND HE HAD FORMED BAD COMPANIONSHIPS MEANWHILE HE GREW SO RANGY AND DEVELOPED SUCH LENGTH AND POWER OF LEG AND SUCH TRAITS OF CHARACTER
AND OVER THE TOP STEP OF THE PORCH BENT A CALCULATING SCRUTINY UPON THE WISTFUL AND SLUMBEROUS DUKE THE SCRUTINY WAS SEARCHING BUT NOT PROLONGED GIPSY MUTTERED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO HIMSELF OH SHEOL
THE MOON WAS SWALLOWED UP AND THERE WAS DARKNESS ALL ABOUT HER THEN A FLASH OF LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY A PEAL OF THUNDER SO TERRIFIED THE PRINCESS THAT SHE CRIED ALOUD FOR THE OLD WOMAN BUT THERE CAME NO ANSWER TO HER CRY
AND I HEAR THE WOLVES IN THE WOOD THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE PRINCESS ENTERED SHE LOOKED ALL AROUND BUT SAW NOTHING OF THE WISE WOMAN IT WAS A SINGLE BARE LITTLE ROOM WITH A WHITE DEAL TABLE
AND THE WONTED BROOMS AND MOPS LEANING AGAINST THE LATTICED WALL AT THE END OF THE PORCH AND THERE BY THE FOOT OF THE STEPS WAS THE STONE SLAB OF THE CISTERN WITH THE IRON COVER DISPLACED AND LYING BESIDE THE ROUND OPENING WHERE THE CARPENTERS HAD LEFT IT NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO
THIS INDISCRETION SO UNCHARACTERISTIC WAS DUE TO THE AGITATION OF A SURPRISED MOMENT FOR DUKE'S EXPERIENCE HAD INCLINED HIM TO A PEACEFUL PESSIMISM AND HE HAD NO AMBITION FOR HAZARDOUS UNDERTAKINGS OF ANY SORT
HIS FEET WERE ALREADY IN MOTION TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD WITH PENROD AND HERMAN HURRYING IN HIS WAKE ONWARD THEY SPED AND DUKE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THESE REINFORCEMENTS
THEN IN HER TERROR THE PRINCESS GREW ANGRY AND SAYING TO HERSELF SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE PLACE ELSE WHO WAS THERE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ME
INDEED IT WAS NOT ONCE NOR TWICE THAT FOR A MOMENT SHE WAS FULLY PERSUADED SHE SAW A GREAT BEAST COMING LEAPING AND BOUNDING THROUGH THE MOONLIGHT TO HAVE HER ALL TO HIMSELF SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT NOT A SINGLE EVIL CREATURE DARED SET FOOT ON THAT HEATH
AND PROFOUNDLY OPPRESSED EVEN IN HIS YOUTH BY THE PURITAN IDEALS OF THE HOUSEHOLD HE SOMETIMES EXPERIENCED A SENSE OF SUFFOCATION HE WANTED FREE AIR AND HE WANTED FREE LIFE HE WANTED THE LIGHTS THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC
HE HAD BEEN A ROLY POLY PEPPER AND SALT KITTEN HE HAD A HOME IN THOSE DAYS AND A NAME GIPSY WHICH HE ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED HE WAS PRECOCIOUS IN DISSIPATION
OR EVEN THAT IF SHE WERE TO FALL ASLEEP WHERE SHE COULD FIND HER THE OLD WITCH WOULD CERTAINLY DO HER BEST TO TWIST HER FACE BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY SAT A MOMENT LONGER BEFORE SHE WAS ASSAILED BY ALL SORTS OF FRESH FEARS
IN THIS HOWEVER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IF SHE HAD ONLY IMAGINED ENOUGH NAMELY THAT THE WISE WOMAN WAS WATCHING OVER HER FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW BUT AFTER ALL SOMEHOW THE THOUGHT OF THE WISE WOMAN WAS LESS FRIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF ANY OF HER OTHER TERRORS
SHE DREAMED THAT SHE WAS THE OLD COLD WOMAN UP IN THE SKY WITH NO HOME AND NO FRIENDS AND NO NOTHING AT ALL NOT EVEN A POCKET WANDERING WANDERING FOREVER OVER A DESERT OF BLUE SAND
SHE HAD BEEN NAUGHTY FOR SO LONG THAT SHE COULD NOT IN A GREAT MANY THINGS TELL THE GOOD FROM THE BAD THEN NOBODY COULD DENY THAT THERE ALL ROUND ABOUT THE HEATH LIKE A RING OF DARKNESS LAY THE GLOOMY FIR WOOD AND THE PRINCESS KNEW WHAT IT WAS FULL OF
THE MOON STARED AT THE PRINCESS AND THE PRINCESS STARED AT THE MOON BUT THE MOON HAD THE BEST OF IT AND THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO CRY AND NOW THE QUESTION WAS BETWEEN THE MOON AND THE COTTAGE THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SHE KNEW THE WORST OF THE MOON
GAZING YET AGAIN AT THE MOON AND THEN CAME THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS IN THE PALACE AT HOME IN HER MIND'S EYE SHE SAW HER MOTHER SITTING AT HER EMBROIDERY WITH THE TEARS DROPPING UPON IT AND HER FATHER STARING INTO THE FIRE
A THING OF NIGHTMARE AND LUNACY GIPSY HAD SEIZED THE FISHBONE BY THE MIDDLE OUT FROM ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND MINGLING WITH HIS WHISKERS PROJECTED THE LONG SPIKED SPINE OF THE BIG FISH DOWN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FEROCIOUS HEAD DANGLED THE FISH'S TAIL
YET WATCHFUL AND CONSTANTLY PLANNING PURELY A MILITARIST BELIEVING IN SLAUGHTER AS IN A RELIGION AND CONFIDENT THAT ART SCIENCE POETRY AND THE GOOD OF THE WORLD WERE HAPPILY ADVANCED THEREBY
AS HE LEFT THE SOLID PORCH BEHIND HIM AND SAILED UPWARD ON AN ASCENDING CURVE INTO THE SUNLIT AIR HIS HEAD WAS PROUDLY UP HE WAS THE INCARNATION OF MENACING POWER AND OF SELF CONFIDENCE
HE ABANDONED THE BOURGEOISIE IRREVOCABLY HE WENT FORTH IN A MAY TWILIGHT CARRYING THE EVENING BEEFSTEAK WITH HIM AND JOINED THE UNDERWORLD HIS EXTRAORDINARY SIZE HIS DARING
UNDAUNTED THE FORMIDABLE CAT RAKED DUKE'S NOSE AGAIN SOMEWHAT MORE LINGERINGLY AND PREPARED TO DEPART WITH HIS FISHBONE HE HAD LITTLE FEAR FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT UNHAMPERED HE COULD WHIP ANYTHING ON EARTH
BOUNDED STRUCK AGAIN AND THEN BOUNDED OUT OF THE WAY THE MEN SILENTLY WATCHED THE CAR ROLLING ALONG BEHIND THEM TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DISGUST LET'S KNOCK THE ENDS OF THESE CARS OUT HE SAID ONCE AGAIN THEY TOOK THE RAIL UP AND BATTERED THEIR WAY THROUGH
LANDED OUT OF POSITION RUNNING A MILE OR SO BEHIND THEM THEY CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE SMOKE OF THE TEXAS THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN THE SMOKE PAUSED AND MOUNTED STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER IT FLATTENED OUT AND ROSE IN A LONG BLACK STREAM
WHO WAS LEANING HALF OUT OF THE WINDOW ABSORBED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS HE GLANCED BACK AND TURNED TO TOM THEY'RE STILL AFTER US HE SAID GRIMLY I WANT TO DROP THE LAST BOX CAR CAN YOU GET BACK THERE AND TELL THE MEN YES ANSWERED TOM
ANSWERED TOM HE SAID IT COOLLY BUT IT REQUIRED AN EFFORT
IT APPEARED INTACT BUT FULLER KNEW THAT LONG CURVING SHED TOO WELL THROUGH HIS YEARS OF TRAVEL OVER THE ROAD NOT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT LURKED INSIDE HE WAVED A SIGNAL TO APPROACH GRADUALLY
OTHERS WAITED WITH TIES THE TRAIN'S SPEED DECREASED GET READY YELLED ROSS THEN AS THEY ENTERED THE SHED GO TOM DREW THE PIN THE CAR SEEMED TO CLING TO THE TRAIN FOR SEVERAL SECONDS THEN THE GENERAL LEAPED AHEAD TIES STREAMED OUT UPON THE TRACK
TOM PULLED ON THE REINS AND STAR PLANTED HIS FEET THEY WENT SLIDING PAST THE SENTRY WITH HIS RIFLE GLINTING IN THE MOONLIGHT HALT THERE CAME THE SECOND WARNING AS STAR CAME TO A STOP PUT YOUR HANDS UP TOM DROPPED THE REINS AND RAISED HIS HANDS STAR ALMOST WINDED
SEEMED PROPPED UPON HIS LEGS RATHER THAN STANDING UPON THEM HIS HEAD DROOPED AND EACH BREATH CAME AS A GREAT HEAVE WHO ARE YOU DEMANDED THE SENTRY FRIEND ANSWERED TOM PASSWORD HAVEN'T GOT IT I'M KEEP YOUR HANDS UP
THE ONE I SENT BACK FROM THE FERRY THAT DAY IT'S IN THE FAR PASTURE THREE MILES AWAY SHE ANSWERED

YOU HOLD STAR WHILE I FIX THE STIRRUPS HE SLID TO THE GROUND AND STOOD THERE WHILE SHE MEASURED THE STRAPS WITH HER ARMS AND FIXED THE BUCKLES HE COULD SEE HER PLAINLY NOW IN THE SOFT MOONLIGHT WHICH WAS FLOODING THE WORLD AHEAD OF THEM WAS THE BLACK WALL OF THE RAIL FENCE NOW SHE SAID
I CAN TELL A FOOL JUST AS FAR AWAY AS I CAN SEE YOU INTERRUPTED WILSON YOU NOW ALF KEEP QUIET SAID THE JUDGE WHAT WERE YOU MEN DOING DOWN THE RINGGOLD ROAD
STAR'S HOOFS POUNDED UPON THE SOFT TURF THEN HIS BODY EMERGED FROM THE SHADOWS TOM COULD SEE MARJORIE CROUCHING RIDING TO HIS GAIT HOLDING HIM DOWN FOR THE JUMP AT THE FENCE THERE WAS AN INSTANT'S PAUSE STAR'S FOREQUARTERS ROSE SLOWLY DELIBERATELY THEN
ALL THE RAID WILL SEEM LIKE AN IMMENSE FAILURE
THEY STOPPED AT A TWO STORY FRAME BUILDING LABELED HOTEL ONE OF THE GUARDS WENT IN THEN MOTIONED TO THE OTHERS TO BRING THE PRISONERS PRESENTLY THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A BIG ROOM LIGHTED BY TWO LAMPS WHICH HUNG FROM THE CEILING
THEY'LL STOP THERE OLD FELLOW HE CONFIDED YOU'VE SHOWN THEM WHAT A PAIR OF HIND HOOFS LOOK LIKE HE REMEMBERED THE ROAD VAGUELY FROM HIS TRIP SOUTHWARD
HE'S CRAZIER THAN ANY YANK I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE REMARKED SHADRACK NODDING TOWARD ALF
THE RESECA BRIDGE WHICH RAN OVER THE OOSTENAULA RIVER WAS COVERED BY A LONG SHED
FULLER WATCHED IT BREATHLESSLY THERE CAME A CLASH OF METAL AS THE WHEEL SLIPPED DOWN FROM THE TIE AND STRUCK THE TRACK
LABORIOUSLY HE DID AS HE WAS TOLD TO DO WITH MARJORIE LEADING STAR THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WOODS ONCE SHE STOPPED AND LISTENED THEY HAVEN'T STARTED YET SHE SAID A FEW MINUTES LATER SHE STOPPED AGAIN THERE'S THE FENCE SHE SAID LET ME MOUNT NOW

WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE FRONT AT THE SIGHT OF TIES LYING ACROSS THE TRACK FULLER'S ARMS SHOT UP AN INSTANT LATER THE TEXAS WAS LABORING TO A STOP UNDER REVERSED POWER HER BRAKES GRABBING AT THE WHEELS THEN WHEN THE DECREASING SPEED OF THE TRAIN GAVE HIS LEGS THE ADVANTAGE
DISAPPEARED RELUCTANTLY INTO THE KITCHEN THE JUDGE SHOOK HIS HEAD LAUGHING THAT MAN ACTS A LITTLE CRAZY SAID TOM OH HE'S HOT HEADED SAID THE JUDGE
WHO ARE YOU DEMANDED THE KEEPER WHAT'S THIS TRAIN ANDREWS SEEMED NOT TO HEAR HIM FOUR CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STANDING SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS AWAY YELLED AND POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WHISTLING BOARD CALLED ANDREWS
HE COULD SEE A WAGON DRAWN UP BESIDE THE HOUSE
THE TEXAS CAME TO A STOP WAIT HERE HE YELLED SLIDING DOWN THE LADDER HE RAN INTO THE SHED THE LEFT FORWARD WHEEL OF THE BOX CAR HAD MOUNTED UPON ONE OF THE TIES THROWN BEFORE IT THE TIE WAS WEDGED DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE TRACK
THAT THE ENGINE WAS HAULING ONLY ONE BOX CAR HE DREADED THAT FIRST SIGHT OF THE RESECA BRIDGE FOR IF ANDREWS HAD LEFT IT IN FLAMES THE RACE WAS OVER FOR THE TEXAS THEN THEY SWEPT AROUND THE CURVE AND THE BRIDGE LAY BEFORE THEM INDISTINCT IN THE DRIZZLE OF RAIN
WHAT WAS IT WE BURNED TOM BRIDGES REPLIED TOM LAUGHING YES FOR BURNING BRIDGES THEN YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME MAYBE ANSWERED THE MAN BUT YOU'RE A GOING WITH ME ALL THE SAME THEN LET'S GO SAID TOM
THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AND COMMENCED TO INVESTIGATE IT WAS A NARROW ROOM WITH ONE WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE YARD HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND LOOKED DOWN
WHERE'RE YOU GOING TOM HELD HIS REINS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND TOOK OFF HIS HAT WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
WHEN TWO HORSEMEN PULLED UP BEFORE THEM THEY YELLED WHEN THEY SAW THE THREE PRISONERS GOOD WORK ALF
INSTINCTIVELY THEY TURNED TOWARD ANDREWS HE WAS IN THE FIREMAN'S SEAT HANDS CLENCHED AND FACE SET STARING AHEAD HE DID NOT MOVE UNTIL THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF GREEN'S STATION THE GENERAL STOPPED AT THE WOOD PILE AND THE MEN JUMPED OUT
INSTANTLY THERE WAS COMMOTION EVERYONE COMMENCED TALKING
TOM CLIMBED UP OVER THE END OF THE TENDER AND REPORTED TO ANDREWS WE TRIED TO WRECK IT HE SAID BUT THE TIE BOUNCED OUT OF THE WAY ANDREWS NODDED AND LEANED FROM THE CAB

WHAT'S THE USE OF STANDING HERE IN THE MUD I'LL WALK YOU BACK TO JUDSON AN YOU CAN TELL YER STORY THERE I AIN'T BELIEVING YOU AND I AIN'T DISBELIEVING YOU TURN AROUND THE WAY YOU WAS A GOING
OH FOR LORD'S SAKE ALF SHUT UP FOR A MINUTE IT SEEMED THAT THE TWO MEN WOULD FIGHT
IF EVER A MAN COMBINED DETERMINATION WITH LUCK IT WAS FULLER HE HAD STARTED ON FOOT FROM BIG SHANTY IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS STOLEN TRAIN UNDOUBTEDLY IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT A PARTY OF NORTHERN RAIDERS HAD TAKEN IT
ONCE AGAIN HE DID AS HE WAS TOLD TO DO SHE BROUGHT STAR TO THE FENCE AT AN EASY TROT LET HIM SMELL IT AND SEE IT
THE TEXAS WAS RUNNING FROM OBSTRUCTION TO OBSTRUCTION CLEARING THE WAY AND PRESSING FORWARD HOW HAD THEY DONE IT HOW HAD THEY PASSED THE BROKEN RAIL THE TIES ALONG THE TRACK THE BOX CARS AND THE SNAG THOSE QUESTIONS WERE POUNDING IN THE BRAINS OF ANDREWS MEN
EVEN UNCLE AND HE HATES EVERYTHING FROM THE NORTH SAYS IT'S THE MOST DARING THING HE'S EVER HEARD OF BUT YOU YOU'RE FROM THE NORTH YES SHE ANSWERED WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE WAR HE JUST TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT I BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE BELIEVES I'VE BEEN HERE TWO YEARS NOW
PUT IT ON THE TOP RAIL AS A MARKER SHE SAID AS SHE TURNED BACK FOR THE RUN TOM SPREAD THE HANDKERCHIEF ON THE FENCE A TINY SPOT OF WHITE TO GUIDE STAR OVER THEN HE WATCHED HER AS SHE RETREATED INTO THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE WOODS HIS HEART THUMPING SO THAT IT HURT
PANTED ANDREWS AS HE RAN BACK PUT AN OBSTRUCTION HERE
CAPTURED HALT THERE THE COMMAND CAME FROM BEHIND THEY WHIPPED ABOUT AND FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A RAISED RIFLE THE MAN WAS A CIVILIAN TALL AND LANKY HE WAVED THE RIFLE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WHERE'RE YOU GOING HE DEMANDED CHATTANOOGA
THROUGH EACH SETTLEMENT HE WALKED STAR QUIETLY BUT ALWAYS READY TO THROW HIMSELF FORWARD DIG HIS HEELS INTO THE HORSE'S FLANKS AND RACE AWAY AN HOUR PASSED TWO HOURS THREE HOURS THEY PRESSED NORTHWARD STEADILY SOMETIMES AT A WALK BUT USUALLY AT A COMFORTABLE STEADY TROT
BUT THEY'LL KNOW NO THEY WON'T BUT TOMORROW WHEN THEY FIND SHE WAS FACING HIM SQUARELY HOLDING TO HIS ARMS AND SHAKING HIM MATTY'S HUSBAND IS THE STABLEMAN HE KNOWS ABOUT YOU
STAR'S FORELEGS WERE REACHING OUT MECHANICALLY FOR THE ROAD CLIPPING IT OFF IN HUGE SECTIONS EACH LEAP SEEMED LIKE A CONVULSION
JOE HANDED THEM CANDLES AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM UPSTAIRS HERE'S ONE ROOM HE SAID TWO OF YOU CAN SLEEP THERE YOU AND SHADRACK TAKE IT SAID TOM TO WILSON GOOD NIGHT THEY SHOOK HANDS HERE'S THE OTHER SAID JOE LEADING THE WAY DOWN THE CORRIDOR
TO JOIN THE SOUTHERN TROOPS WHAT YELLED THE JUDGE THERE YOU ARE ALF SHOUTED TRIUMPHANTLY GET EM TOM JUMPED TO HIS FEET THERE WAS NO TIME TO WARN WILSON AND SHADRACK
IF YOU'LL HELP ME MOUNT HE HELD HIS HANDS BRACED AGAINST HIS KNEES SO THAT THEY FORMED A STEP FOR HER SHE WAS UP ADJUSTING HERSELF TO THE SADDLE STROKING STAR'S NECK TALKING TO HIM SOFTLY YOU CLIMB THE FENCE AND WAIT ON THE OTHER SIDE SHE ORDERED
THEN TOO SHE FALTERED AND STOPPED WHAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BY THE MAIN ROAD I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS THEN THERE'S A FENCE TO JUMP I'M GOING TO TAKE STAR OVER IT IT WAS USELESS TO PROTEST FOR SHE BECAME CALM AGAIN AND DETERMINED
FULLER WAVED HIS ARMS UP AND DOWN SLOWLY TO THE ENGINEER AS A SIGNAL TO COME TO A GRADUAL STOP THEY COASTED DOWN UPON THE BOX CAR PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT ON WITH THEM FULLER AND MURPHY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF IT MURPHY STAYING AT THE REAR END TO REPEAT THE SIGNALS OF FULLER
THEY HAD SHUNTED AND OUTRACED THE TRAIN JUMPED THE BROKEN TRACK
IT WAS THE ONE THEY HAD RIPPED FROM THE TIES NORTH OF CALHOUN THEY FORCED THE STRAIGHT END OF IT UNDER THE TRACK LEAVING THE BENT END PROJECTING TOWARD THE PURSUERS A SCARCELY VISIBLE SNAG WHICH WOULD RIP INTO THE ENGINE KEEP DROPPING TIES MEN ORDERED ANDREWS
BUT EXPECTING TO FIND IT ABANDONED AROUND EACH CURVE HE RACED ON AND ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE HAND CAR THEN THE YONAH WHEN THE YONAH HAD RUN OUT OF FUEL THE NEW YORK WAS THERE TO CARRY HIM TO THE ROME ENGINE WHEN THE ROME ENGINE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY THE BREAK IN THE TRACK
TO JUMP ON THAT MESS OF FARM TOOLS BELOW HIM WOULD PROBABLY MEAN A BROKEN LEG
AND STILL THEY PRESSED ON THE FORCE OF FULLER'S DETERMINATION SEEMED GREATER THAN THE FORCE OF THE STEAM WHICH FLASHED AGAINST THE PISTONS OF THE TEXAS FULLER AND MURPHY STILL SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE TENDER SAW THE ABANDONED BOX CAR AS THEY SWERVED AROUND THE BEND
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE THE DECENCY ANSWERED WILSON TO ASK US WHO WE ARE BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER WELL THEN WHO ARE YOU
I'LL LET A BULLET GO SMACK INTO THE FIRST MAN THAT MAKES A MOVE HE SHOULDN'T HERE WAS A MAN THEY COULDN'T TALK DOWN HE WAS PROBABLY A GOOD SHOT AND READY TO KEEP HIS THREAT IF ONLY THEY COULD GET HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AND PULL THEIR REVOLVERS BEFORE HE COULD FIRE BUT SUCH HOPES WERE SHATTERED A FEW MINUTES LATER
REPLIED THE MAN THAT SO ASKED WILSON I CAN THINK OF BETTER COMPANY IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT RIFLE WAVING AROUND IN THE AIR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP AN KEEP EM UP ORDERED THE MAN
REPLIED ALF YOU TWO RIDE ALONG BESIDE EM I'M DONE UP TOTIN THIS GUN THE PROCESSION STARTED AGAIN
PLOTTING OUT A WAY OF ESCAPING HE DECIDED TO REMAIN AT THE HOLE LISTENING FOR JOE'S VOICE
TOM DID NOT LOOK BACK BUT HE CAST OUT SHORT BROKEN SENTENCES TO CONSOLE HIS PURSUER HUH RACE ME ON THAT HUNK O' DOG MEAT GET A HORSE IF YOU WANT TO RACE ME GET A HORSE A HORSE THAT CAN
HE LEANED OVER AND PEERED IN BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING THEN HE PUT HIS EAR AGAINST THE THIN WALL AND LISTENED
I DON'T DARE TO STOP AND BUILD A FIRE THEY'RE TOO CLOSE UPON US NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TOM REALIZED THAT THE RAID MIGHT FAIL IN ITS PURPOSE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE RACE OF REACHING THIS POINT WHERE THE ROAD TO CHATTANOOGA LAY CLEAR BEFORE THEM HAD BEEN UPON HIM
KEEP TO THE STORY NO TALKING THERE ORDERED ONE OF THE HORSEMEN
WE'RE ALL ARMED NO ANSWERED ANDREWS THEY'LL BE BETTER ARMED HE STILL BELIEVED THAT THE ENGINE IN THEIR REAR HAD COME FROM ATLANTA
ANDREWS WAVED HIM ASIDE THROW THAT WOOD ABOARD MEN HE SAID BUT THEY HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THE PILE THEN THEY HEARD REPEATED SHORT BLASTS OF A WHISTLE TO THE SOUTHWARD THE MEN PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ANDREWS PILE IT IN HURRY HE YELLED
TOM LEFT THE HOLE AND CONTINUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS
JUST A MIXTURE OF THINGS WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN THERE FOR WANT OF A BETTER PLACE HE THOUGHT
SAID KNIGHT THE OTHERS HEARD HIM AND MADE NO REPLY HE WORKED WITH THE DRAFTS COAXING THE FIRE OCCASIONALLY BROWN GLANCED AT THE STEAM GAUGE THEN THE TWO ENGINEERS WOULD EXCHANGE GLANCES SLOWLY THE NEEDLE OF THE GAUGE CREPT UP
STRAINING TO CATCH THE FIRST SOUNDS OF THE NEGROES RETURNING THERE THEY ARE GENERAL MARJORIE HE SAID PRESENTLY SHE JUMPED UP AND RAN TO THE HORSE TOM COULD SEE HER PRESSING HER CHEEK TO THE HORSE'S NOSE STROKING ITS HEAD AND NECK GO BACK NOW SHE SAID TO THE NEGROES
THEN IN THE END OF THE SECOND CAR THEY PASSED THE REMAINING TIES AND THE RAILS FORWARD I'LL PULL THE PIN SAID TOM
GOOD LUCK TOM HE GLANCED BACK AND SAW HER STANDING THERE HER ARMS RAISED ABOVE HER HEAD THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD HER HANDKERCHIEF
STAR FLOATED OVER THE FENCE HE HAD CLEARED IT BY A FOOT MARJORIE WHEELED ABOUT DISMOUNTED AND READJUSTED THE STIRRUPS THERE SHE SAID NOW NOW GO I CAN NEVER THANK YOU HE BEGAN DON'T PLEASE DON'T EVEN TRY SHE INTERRUPTED
YELLED BROWN TOM TOOK UP THE WORK OF DRAGGING LOGS FROM THE TENDER AND STUFFING THEM IN THE FIRE BOX HE STOPPED ONCE AND POINTED TO THE WOOD PILE FUEL WAS RUNNING LOW AT GREEN'S STATION SAID ANDREWS WATER THERE TOO ASKED BROWN
FULLER WAS AHEAD HEAVING TIES FROM THE ROAD
BROWN TOOK THE THROTTLE AND PUSHED THE GENERAL ONWARD TOWARD GREEN'S STATION TOM PUT THE LAST OF THE FUEL IN THE FIRE AND LEANED WEARILY AGAINST THE CAB DROPS OF RAIN CARRIED BY THE WIND SPLASHED UPON HIM AND RAN DOWN HIS BODY STREAKING THE SOOT WHICH COVERED HIS CHEST AND STOMACH
GUESS THEY WON'T BOTHER ABOUT US HE REMARKED WONDER HOW MUCH GROUND WE COVERED THEN MUST BE PRETTY CLOSE HALT IT WAS A CRY THAT BROUGHT A YELL OF EXULTATION TO TOM'S LIPS THERE WAS NO MISTAKING IT NO CIVILIAN COULD SAY HALT IN THAT TONE
THE LAST DASH HERE WE ARE MARJORIE HE WENT FORWARD TO MEET HER
THE WHEELS OF THE ABANDONED CAR KNOCKED SEVERAL OUT OF THE WAY THEN AS THE TRAIN SWUNG ABOUT THE CURVE LEAVING THE CAR HIDDEN IN THE SHED TOM SAW ONE TIE RESTING AT AN ANGLE ACROSS THE TRACK THE WHEELS STRUCK IT AND THE CAR LURCHED HEAVILY THEY COULD SEE NO MORE
AT TILTON JUST A FEW MILES FARTHER ON
JUST AT THE MOMENT OF LOSING MOMENTUM FULLER MADE A HASTY EXAMINATION THEN RAN BACK TO THE TEXAS MURPHY WAS COMING FORWARD TO MEET HIM THEY'VE DROPPED THE SECOND BOX CAR IN THERE EXPLAINED FULLER THE FRONT WHEELS ARE OFF THE TRACK WE CAN DRAG IT BACK I THINK
A BOX CAR EITHER WRECKED OR MERELY LEFT STANDING COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE PURSUING ENGINE WAS ALMOST UPON IT
GET READY BOY HE WHISPERED REINING IN SLIGHTLY
SHE ANSWERED CRYING I WON'T LET YOU HERE JOE AND SAM PUT THOSE THINGS DOWN AND STAY HERE OH TOM THEY'LL SURELY CATCH YOU IF YOU TRY IT SHE CLUTCHED HIS ARM AS THOUGH TO HOLD HIM FROM RUNNING INTO THE WOODS BUT MARJORIE THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO HE PROTESTED PLEASE GO BACK
BUT PERHAPS JOE MIGHT LEAVE FOR A MOMENT
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY THINK BEST I'D TAKE EM OVER TONIGHT ANSWERED ALF THE CONVERSATION CARRIED ALONG UPON THOSE LINES LASTED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITH THE JUDGE DOMINATING
WHEN MOTHER AND FATHER WERE ALIVE I LIVED IN ALBANY I'M GOING BACK JUST AS SOON AS I CAN LISTEN THERE WERE MORE HORSES ON THE ROAD THEY'RE COMING TO JOIN KIRBY SHE SAID I HEARD HIM SAY THAT MORE MEN WERE COMING WHEN UNCLE WENT DOWN TO LET THEM IN
THEN WITH HIS HAT HE SLAPPED THE MAN'S HORSE ON THE HEAD HE WHOOPED AND DUG HIS HEELS INTO STAR'S FLANKS AS THEY SHOT FORWARD HE SAW THE OTHER HORSE REAR UP PAWING THE AIR
THEN THE DOOR OF THE ROOM DOWNSTAIRS OPENED WITH A BANG THE MAN WHO HAD ENTERED ANNOUNCED
PREPARED FOR A BATTLE THERE ARE BRIDGES AHEAD THE CHICKAMAUGA BRIDGES WE'LL DROP ANOTHER CAR ON THE RESECA BRIDGE GO BACK AND TELL THEM I'LL SLOW DOWN TRY TO WRECK IT IN THE SHED TOM HURRIED BACK AGAIN OVER THE WOOD PILE
GOOD LUCK ONCE AGAIN GOOD BY STAR DEAR SHE PRESSED HER CHEEK AGAINST THE HORSE'S HEAD GOOD BY TOM REMEMBER ME ALWAYS HE MOUNTED AND FOR A MOMENT THEY DELAYED THE PARTING HE REACHED DOWN AND TOOK HER HAND ALWAYS LITTLE SOLDIER ALWAYS HE SAID
YOU MUST JOE SAM GO UP TO THE STABLE AND SADDLE MY HORSE AND BRING HIM HERE RUN YASSUM REPLIED THE NEGROES IN A BREATH THEY DISAPPEARED INTO THE DARKNESS TOM'S PROTEST WAS SMOTHERED UNDER MARJORIE'S HAND
AS IT WAS THE CARS CLEARED IT THE SNAG CAUGHT ON THE LOW COW CATCHER OF THE ENGINE AND GAVE THE TRAIN A MIGHTY JERK THEY WERE PAST IT BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN FACT FULLER DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LATER
IT WAS EASY WE DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE UNION SENTRY WHERE DID YOU COME ACROSS THE RIVER
HIS EYES MET KNIGHT'S AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER DUMBLY
WHEN I COULD HELP YOU YOU'RE WORTH A DOZEN SOLDIERS HE EXCLAIMED THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE POOR TOM SHE SAID SOFTLY IT'S ALL SO TERRIBLE ISN'T IT AND SO WONDERFUL YOU MEN HAVE LEFT THE WHOLE SOUTH GASPING AT YOUR BRAVERY

THAT HIS LEGS HAD BEEN TOO WEAK TO CARRY HIM HE LEANED FORWARD RIDING EASILY PEERING AHEAD AT THE ROAD STAR WAS WILLING BUT NO HORSE COULD STAND SUCH A PACE FOREVER SO HE REINED IN TO A TROT
AND KIRBY IS TAKING THE ROAD TO WARTRACE IF YOU'RE AHEAD OF HIM THEY'LL NEVER CATCH YOU STAR CAN RUN LIKE THE WIND STAR MY HORSE SHE EXPLAINED HE'S A BEAUTIFUL HORSE OH I WISH THEY'D HURRY THERE WAS ANGUISH IN HER VOICE
IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THAT THEIR LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST SO MANY OBSTACLES COULD END IN ANYTHING BUT GLORIOUS SUCCESS SURELY THEY COULD DO SOMETHING TO BLOCK THE WAY OF THE PURSUING ENGINE CAN'T WE STOP AND FIGHT HE ASKED
THE BENT RAIL WHICH ANDREWS HAD LEFT AS A SNAG IN THE TRACK
STOP ABOUT A MILE UP HERE KNIGHT ON A CURVE
THE FLANGE RODE ON THE RAIL THEN SETTLED INTO POSITION FORCING THE RIGHT WHEEL UP FULLER YELLED IN TRIUMPH KICKED THE TIE OFF THE TRACK AND JUMPED FOR THE LADDER THE STEAM HISSED AS THE TEXAS WAS THROWN INTO REVERSE AGAIN THEY SWEPT OUT OF THE SHED PUSHING THE TWO CARS
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A BOAT IT WAS FOUND ASHORE A FEW MILES DOWN THE RIVER AND THERE WAS A REPORT FROM CHATTANOOGA THAT THE BOAT HAD BEEN TAKEN I DIDN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT ALL OH I WISH JOE AND SAM WOULD HURRY YOU MUST GET STARTED BEFORE THEY LEAVE MEN ARE GOING OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
HE MOTIONED MURPHY AHEAD WHAT WAS THAT HE ASKED DON'T KNOW SOMETHING ON THE TRACK THOUGHT THE ENGINE WAS GOING OFF FOR A SECOND THEY'LL PROBABLY STOP AT GREEN'S FOR WOOD SAID FULLER KEEP THE WHISTLE GOING
I WANT TO DO IT SHE SAID YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR HELP AND IT'S MY RIGHT TO HELP YOU ALL I CAN AND REMEMBER I'LL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF IT OH SO PROUD SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INTO HIS AND THEY SAT THERE QUIETLY
IN THE BOX CAR THE MEN SILENTLY DROPPED TIES UPON THE TRACKS SOMETIMES THERE WAS A MUMBLE OF SATISFACTION AS A TIE FELL SQUARELY ACROSS THE RAILS
LOOSENED ONE TACK AND BENT THE CORNER UP THEN HE PUT HIS EAR DOWN AND LISTENED ALF HAD JUST RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHY NOT TAKE EM TO CHATTANOOGA NOW HE WAS DEMANDING TURN EM OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES NOW ALF SAID THE JUDGE
I WENT TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS TO HEAR WHAT THEY WERE SAYING UNCLE TOOK THEM INTO THE DINING ROOM TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK THEN I DRESSED AND STOLE DOWN
NOW LET'S SEARCH THESE MEN AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND TOM SHADRACK AND WILSON HELD THEIR ARMS UP WHILE THE MEN DUMPED THE CONTENTS OF THEIR POCKETS ON A TABLE THREE REVOLVERS HANDKERCHIEFS CONFEDERATE MONEY THEY FOUND NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE
WHILE MURPHY SIGNALED THE TEXAS INTO THE SHED FULLER AND THE FIREMAN RAN FORWARD WITH THE CROW BAR AND HAMMER CAREFUL NOW YELLED FULLER AS THE TWO BOX CARS CAME CLOSER TOGETHER EASY EASY THE CARS MET GENTLY
IT WAS NEARLY SIX O'CLOCK WHEN THEY REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN OF JUDSON AS THEY WENT DOWN THE MAIN STREET MEN AND BOYS TAGGED ALONG BESIDE THEM PLYING THE GUARDS WITH QUESTIONS THE GUARDS WAVED THEM ASIDE AND ANSWERED DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THEM OR NOT PICKED EM UP A PIECE DOWN THE ROAD
WHILE THE FIREMAN HAMMERED THE TOP OVER NOW RUN BACK SLOWLY AN INCH AT A TIME ORDERED FULLER THE ENGINEER OPENED THE THROTTLE AND THE TEXAS CREPT AWAY TAKING UP THE SLACK IN THE COUPLINGS THE LEFT WHEEL FOLLOWED BACK ALONG THE GROOVE ITS FLANGE HAD CUT IN THE TIE
TOM FLAT AGAINST STAR'S NECK WITH THE BLACK MANE WHIPPING HIS FACE SPED DOWN THE ROAD PAST THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD MET ANDREWS THAT FIRST DAY OF THE RAID PAST THE WIDOW FRY'S AND DOWN THE ONE STREET OF MANCHESTER AT A FULL GALLOP KEEP IT UP STAR HE URGED
GOOD BY LISTEN THE SOUNDS OF SHOUTING CAME FROM THE BEECHAM'S THEY'RE STARTING GO STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL YOU COME TO THE ROAD THEN TO YOUR LEFT
WELL THIS WAY WE WON'T TAKE THE WRONG ROAD AGAIN SAID TOM I'D RATHER WALK AT THE END OF A RIFLE THAN DROWN IN THIS MUD
SOME OF THE BEASTS WERE GOOD TO EAT AND OTHERS WERE NOT GOOD AT ALL THE OX WAS FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD
FULL OF COMPASSION NEVERTHELESS SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF SHE IS NOT MY AGNES SHE IS AS MUCH IN NEED OF HELP AS IF SHE WERE IF I CANNOT BE GOOD TO MY OWN
PERHAPS HER WORDS WERE NOT JUST LIKE THESE BUT HER THOUGHTS WERE SHE TOOK UP THE CHILD AND CARRIED HER HOME
BY DEGREES FROM THINKING HERSELF SO CLEVER SHE CAME TO FANCY THAT WHATEVER SEEMED TO HER MUST OF COURSE BE THE CORRECT JUDGMENT AND WHATEVER SHE WISHED THE RIGHT THING AND GREW SO OBSTINATE
THE WISE WOMAN WALKED CLOSE PAST THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOGS AND THROUGH THE MIDST OF HIS FLOCK OF SHEEP THE SHEPHERD WONDERED WHERE SHE COULD BE GOING RIGHT UP THE HILL
THEN THERE CAME A TIME WHEN THE FRUITS AND NUTS BECAME SCARCE PEOPLE HAD TO EAT MEAT SO THEY BEGAN KILLING THE VARIOUS BEASTS TO SEE WHICH ONES WERE THE BEST TO EAT THEY SKINNED THEM AND CUT THEM IN PIECES AND COOKED THEM OVER THE FIRE
THE WISE WOMAN THEREFORE ONE DAY WALKED UP TO THE DOOR OF THE SHEPHERD'S COTTAGE DRESSED LIKE A POOR WOMAN AND ASKED FOR A DRINK OF WATER THE SHEPHERD'S WIFE LOOKED AT HER LIKED HER AND BROUGHT HER A CUP OF MILK
THEY WOULD EVEN SAY SOMETIMES THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HEAR HER OWN PRAISES FOR FEAR IT SHOULD MAKE HER VAIN AND THEN WHISPER THEM BEHIND THEIR HANDS BUT SO LOUD THAT SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO HEAR EVERY WORD THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
AT LAST HE WAS FREE WHEN THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND RIDE AWAY IN TRIUMPH ON THE BACK OF A DEVIL IS ONE OF THE POOREST SO LONG AS SHE WAS LEFT TO TAKE HER OWN WAY AND DO AS SHE WOULD SHE GAVE HER PARENTS LITTLE TROUBLE SHE WOULD PLAY ABOUT BY HERSELF IN THE LITTLE GARDEN WITH ITS FEW HARDY FLOWERS
THIS MORNING HE WAS FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED
HER COMMONPLACE SPEECHES WERE SAID OVER AGAIN AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE FINEST POETRY AND THE PRETTY WAYS WHICH EVERY MODERATELY GOOD CHILD HAS WERE EXTOLLED AS IF THE RESULT OF HER EXCELLENT TASTE AND THE CHOICE OF HER JUDGMENT AND WILL
BUT BY DEGREES THEY HAD SPOILED HER AND THIS WAS THE WAY THEY WERE SO PROUD OF HER THAT THEY ALWAYS REPEATED EVERY THING SHE SAID AND TOLD EVERY THING SHE DID EVEN WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT
AND SUDDENLY LAPPED HER IN THE FOLDS OF HER CLOAK WHEN THE MOTHER AGAIN LIFTED HER EYES SHE HAD VANISHED
THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD AGAIN THE MONKEY SAID THIS TIME IN A LITTLE LOUDER VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY PLEASE GIVE ME A BANANA JUST ONE LITTLE RIPE LITTLE
WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE OR DANGEROUS AS THE WRATHFUL ONE THE CONCEITED ONE HOWEVER WAS SOMETIMES VERY ANGRY AND THEN HER ANGER WAS MORE SPITEFUL THAN THE OTHER'S AND AGAIN THE WRATHFUL ONE WAS OFTEN VERY CONCEITED TOO
WHEN HE GOT THROUGH PLAYING HE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE WAS THE MAN WAITING FOR HIM HE CRAWLED QUICKLY BACK
SAID THE MONKEY JUST LET ME OUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WELL I CAN DANCE
DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY MADE SUCH AN UPROAR WITH HIS CRIES AND SHOUTS THAT VERY SOON MONKEYS CAME RUNNING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WERE BIG MONKEYS AND LITTLE MONKEYS AND MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS
A WHOLE ARMY OF MONKEYS HAD COME TO THE AID OF THE BIGGEST MONKEY IT WAS THE VERY LITTLEST MONKEY WHO THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS PLIGHT
THIS IS NOT THE MONKEY'S LEG IT IS JUST A DRY STICK HE SAID AS HE MADE A WRY FACE THEN HE FISHED THE EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL OUT OF THE POT THAT IS NOT THE MONKEY'S HEAD HE SAID AS HE TASTED IT
THE WISE WOMAN LOOKED AT THE MOTHER YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED IT TO HER IF YOU DID NOT MEAN HER TO HAVE IT SAID THE MOTHER SIDING WITH THE DEVIL IN HER CHILD AGAINST THE WISE WOMAN AND HER CHILD TOO SOME FOOLISH PEOPLE THINK THEY TAKE ANOTHER'S PART
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE BIGGEST MONKEY PASSED THAT WAY HE SAW THE IMAGE OF WAX AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A BOY PEDDLING BANANAS HE HAD OFTEN PUSHED OVER BOY BANANA PEDDLERS UPSET THEIR BASKETS AND THEN HAD RUN AWAY WITH THE BANANAS
SO THEY LET THE MONKEY FILL THE POT AS HE LIKED HE PUT INTO IT SOME LITTLE DRY STICKS AND AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL THEN HE SAID O CHILDREN O CHILDREN I CANNOT DANCE ANY MORE IT IS SO HOT HERE IN THIS ROOM THE CHILDREN
SO THAT ON THE WHOLE OF TWO VERY UNPLEASANT CREATURES I WOULD SAY THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORSE HAD NOT THE SHEPHERD'S BEEN QUITE AS BAD BUT AS I HAVE SAID
BUT SHE WAS NO BETTER FOR ALL THAT AND WAS QUITE AS UGLY IN THE EYES OF THE WISE WOMAN WHO COULD NOT ONLY SEE BUT READ HER FACE
TILL SHE HAD FINISHED IT THEN LOOKING INTO THE EMPTY CUP SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME BACK AS MUCH AS YOU HAD NO CLAIM UPON AGNES TURNED AWAY AND MADE NO ANSWER FAR LESS FROM SHAME THAN INDIGNATION
SWEET LITTLE BANANA THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT IN HIS LOUDEST VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME A BANANA I'LL GIVE YOU SUCH A PUSH THAT IT WILL UPSET
THAT IS JUST AN EMPTY COCOANUT SHELL HE COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE TRACE OF THE MONKEY IN THAT MONKEY STEW
NOW AS THE LEAST ATOM OF CONCEIT IS A THING TO BE ASHAMED OF YOU MAY FANCY WHAT SHE WAS LIKE WITH SUCH A QUANTITY OF IT INSIDE HER AT FIRST IT DID NOT SHOW ITSELF OUTSIDE IN ANY VERY ACTIVE FORM
WHEN HE TOOK HIS HALF HE GAVE THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THE BANANAS WHICH GROW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH AND ARE SMALL AND WRINKLED THE NICE BIG FAT ONES HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF AND CARRIED THEM HOME TO LET THEM RIPEN IN THE DARK
AND OF SUCH PLAYTHINGS SHE WAS NEVER TIRED SOMETIMES HOWEVER SHE PREFERRED PLAYING WITH STONES WHICH WERE PLENTIFUL AND FLOWERS WHICH WERE FEW OR THE BROOKS THAT RAN DOWN THE HILL OF WHICH
AND A DOUBLE VERTICAL WRINKLE SETTLED OVER HER NOSE THE WISE WOMAN SAW IT FOR ALL HER BUSINESS WAS WITH AGNES THOUGH SHE LITTLE KNEW IT AND RISING WENT AND OFFERED THE CUP TO THE CHILD WHERE SHE SAT WITH HER KNITTING IN A CORNER
DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THEY LET HIM THINK THAT THE STICKS AND THE COCOANUT SHELL IN THE POT WAS THE MONKEY
WHICH WOULD IN ANOTHER HAVE DISGUSTED THEM ALTOGETHER IMPERTINENT AND RUDE THINGS DONE BY THEIR CHILD THEY THOUGHT SO CLEVER LAUGHING AT THEM AS SOMETHING QUITE MARVELLOUS
THE NEW BODY THAT WAS GROWING INSIDE OF IT AND WOULD COME OUT OF IT WHEN SHE DIED WOULD BE UGLY AND CROOKED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE AN AGED HAWTHORN THAT HAS LIVED HUNDREDS OF YEARS EXPOSED UPON ALL SIDES TO SALT SEA WINDS
OR AMONGST THE HEATHER WHERE THE BEES WERE BUSY OR SHE WOULD WANDER AWAY AMONGST THE HILLS AND BE NOBODY KNEW WHERE SOMETIMES FROM MORNING TO NIGHT NOR DID HER PARENTS VENTURE TO FIND FAULT WITH HER SHE NEVER WENT INTO RAGES LIKE THE PRINCESS
THAT SHE SOON CAME TO BELIEVE SO SOON THAT SHE COULD NOT RECALL THE TIME WHEN SHE DID NOT BELIEVE AS THE MOST ABSOLUTE FACT IN THE UNIVERSE THAT SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT IS SHE BECAME MOST IMMODERATELY CONCEITED
AFTER THE POT HAD BOILED A WHILE HE CALLED THE CHILDREN TO COME TO SUPPER WITH HIM THE CHILDREN LET HIM TASTE FIRST HE FISHED A HARD STICK OUT OF THE POT AND BIT INTO IT
BUT OF BEGINNING AT ONCE TO GROW TO NO END BUT IF SHE WERE NOT MADE HUMBLE HER GROWING WOULD BE TO A MASS OF DISTORTED SHAPES ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE BODY SHE NOW SHOWED MIGHT GROW UP STRAIGHT AND WELL SHAPED AND COMELY TO BEHOLD
PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW IT BUT THE MONKEYS THINK THAT ALL THE BANANAS BELONG TO THEM WHEN BRAZILIAN CHILDREN EAT BANANAS THEY SAY I AM A MONKEY I ONCE KNEW A LITTLE BOY IN BRAZIL WHO WAS VERY VERY FOND OF BANANAS
AS TIME WENT ON THIS DISEASE OF SELF CONCEIT WENT ON TOO GRADUALLY DEVOURING THE GOOD THAT WAS IN HER FOR THERE IS NO FAULT THAT DOES NOT BRING ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS TO LIVE WITH IT
THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY ANGRY SHE LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME WAY BY WHICH SHE COULD GET EVEN WITH THE MONKEY AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF A TRICK
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE MANY SHE COULD ONLY PLAY WITH ONE AT A TIME AND THAT INDEED TROUBLED HER A LITTLE OR LIVE LAMBS THAT WERE NOT ALL WOOL OR THE SHEEP DOGS WHICH WERE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HER AND THE BEST OF PLAYFELLOWS AS SHE THOUGHT FOR SHE HAD NO HUMAN ONES TO COMPARE THEM WITH
VERY IMAGE OF HER OWN AND SHE LOOKED SO SIMPERING AND MAWKISH AND SELF CONSCIOUS AND SILLY THAT SHE MADE THE WISE WOMAN FEEL RATHER SICK NOT THAT THE CHILD WAS A FOOL
STRAIGHT INTO THIS CLOUD THE SHEPHERD SAW THE WOMAN HOLD HER PACE AND IN IT SHE VANISHED HE LITTLE IMAGINED THAT HIS CHILD WAS UNDER HER CLOAK HE WENT HOME AS USUAL IN THE EVENING BUT AGNES HAD NOT COME IN
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME MILK PORRIDGE FOR THEIR DINNER AGNES DID NOT MIND IT AT THE TIME BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE MILK NOW GIVEN TO A BEGGAR AS SHE CALLED THE WISE WOMAN
AND HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE WENT UP AND UP IT WAS NEAR SUNSET AND AS THE SUN WENT DOWN A GRAY CLOUD SETTLED ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH HIS LAST RAYS TURNED INTO A ROSY GOLD
ONLY HER WORM HAD A FACE AND
THE MONKEY DANCED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OUT OF THE DOOR AWAY TO THE TREE TOP THAT WAS THE LAST THEY EVER SAW OF HIM HE MOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE
ONE DAY HOWEVER HE CAUGHT THE MONKEY NAPPING HE SHUT HIM UP IN A BOX AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO THE CHILDREN FOR SUPPER THE MAN PUT A BIG DISH FULL OF WATER OVER THE FIRE READY TO COOK THE MONKEY
AND ACCEPT A DRAUGHT OF MILK WITHOUT BEING A BEGGAR IN ANY SUCH SENSE AS AGNES'S CONTEMPTUOUS USE OF THE WORD IMPLIED A CLOUD CAME UPON HER FOREHEAD
THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY
HE ALWAYS SAID I AM VERY MUCH OF A MONKEY IF YOU ARE FOND OF BANANAS THE BRAZILIAN CHILDREN WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE A MONKEY TOO THIS IS THE STORY THEY TELL TO SHOW US HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT
I WILL BE AS GOOD AS I CAN TO SOME OTHER WOMAN'S AND THOUGH I SHOULD SCORN TO BE CONSOLED FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BY THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER I YET MAY FIND SOME GLADNESS IN RESCUING ONE CHILD FROM THE DEATH WHICH HAS TAKEN THE OTHER
THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH AN ABSENCE NOW AND THEN AND WERE NOT AT FIRST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN IT GREW DARK AND SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE HUSBAND SET OUT WITH HIS DOGS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE WIFE IN ANOTHER TO SEEK THEIR CHILD
UNTIL AT LENGTH ALL GAVE UP THE SEARCH IN DESPAIR EXCEPT THE MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NEARLY CONVINCED NOW THAT THE POOR WOMAN HAD CARRIED HER OFF ONE DAY
ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD HAD JUST BEEN MADE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE KIND OF BANANA BUT VERY MANY KINDS OF MONKEYS THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD A BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
SHE DECIDED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD WHERE SHE RAISED CABBAGES INSTEAD OF BANANAS THE MONKEYS WERE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF THE BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
ONE DAY HE FELT THAT HE JUST MUST HAVE SOME MUSIC HE HID IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND THERE HE PLAYED UPON HIS GUITAR HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE MAN WOULD HEAR HIM BUT THE MAN HAD VERY SHARP EARS
VANITY WHICH IS A FORM OF SELF CONCEIT HAS REPEATEDLY SHOWN ITSELF AS THE DEEPEST FEELING IN THE HEART OF A HORRIBLE MURDERESS THAT MORNING AT BREAKFAST HER MOTHER HAD STINTED HER IN MILK JUST A LITTLE
THE MONKEY WITH THE LOUDEST VOICE ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID MADE THE SUN HEAR THE SUN CAME AT ONCE THE SUN POURED HIS HOTTEST RAYS DOWN UPON THE WAX
THE WISE WOMAN TOOK IT FOR SHE MADE IT A RULE TO ACCEPT EVERY KINDNESS THAT WAS OFFERED HER AGNES WAS NOT BY NATURE A GREEDY GIRL AS I HAVE SAID BUT SELF CONCEIT WILL GO FAR TO GENERATE EVERY OTHER VICE UNDER THE SUN
AND HE WAS TO SHOUT HIS VERY LOUDEST TO THE SUN AND ASK THE SUN TO COME AND HELP THE BIGGEST MONKEY OUT OF HIS DREADFUL DIFFICULTY THIS IS WHAT ALL THE BIG SIZED LITTLE SIZED MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS DID
AND SO FULL OF ADMIRATION OF THEIR CHILD WERE THEY THAT THEY WONDERED AND LAUGHED AT AND PRAISED THINGS IN HER WHICH IN ANOTHER CHILD WOULD NEVER HAVE STRUCK THEM AS THE LEAST REMARKABLE AND SOME THINGS EVEN
SHE PLAYED WITH THE TOYS HER FATHER MADE HER AND THOUGHT THEM THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE WORLD WINDMILLS AND LITTLE CROOKS AND WATER WHEELS AND SOMETIMES LAMBS MADE ALL OF WOOL AND DOLLS MADE OUT OF THE LEG BONES OF SHEEP WHICH HER MOTHER DRESSED FOR HER
FOR WHOEVER IS POSSESSED BY A DEVIL JUDGES WITH THE MIND OF THAT DEVIL AND HENCE AGNES WAS GUILTY OF SUCH A MEANNESS AS MANY WHO ARE THEMSELVES CAPABLE OF SOMETHING JUST AS BAD WILL CONSIDER INCREDIBLE THE WISE WOMAN WAITED
AND SO THEY RUN ABOUT FOREVER LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN SHADOWS THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP THEM AND MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND THEM BEING THEMSELVES TOO NEAR THE GROUND TO HAVE ANY SHADOWS AND WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AT LAST THERE IS BUT ONE WHO KNOWS
THE IMAGE OF WAX WAS SILENT THE MONKEY RAN TOWARD THE IMAGE OF WAX AND STRUCK IT HARD WITH HIS HAND HIS HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY HAND
SHE HAD WANDERED SOME DISTANCE FROM HER COTTAGE THINKING SHE MIGHT COME UPON THE REMAINS OF HER DAUGHTER AT THE FOOT OF SOME CLIFF WHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY INSTEAD UPON A DISCONSOLATE LOOKING CREATURE SITTING ON A STONE BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM
HAD SHE BEEN THE WISE WOMAN WOULD HAVE ONLY PITIED AND LOVED HER INSTEAD OF FEELING SICK WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HER SHE HAD VERY FAIR ABILITIES AND WERE SHE ONCE BUT MADE HUMBLE WOULD BE CAPABLE NOT ONLY OF DOING A GOOD DEAL IN TIME
THE CHILDREN CAME CROWDING CLOSE TO THE BOX O CHILDREN O CHILDREN SAID THE MONKEY DON'T YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD SEE THE MONKEY DANCE THE CHILDREN REPLIED THAT THEY WISHED THEY COULD
ALL THE TIME THE MAN WAS COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MONKEY JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND AND SEIZE THE MONKEY THE MONKEY GAVE A SUDDEN LEAP TO THE TREE AND HURRIED AWAY TO THE TREE TOP AFTER THAT
THE MONKEY WAS AT LAST ABLE TO PULL OUT ONE OF HIS HANDS THE SUN POURED DOWN MORE OF HIS HOTTEST RAYS AND SOON THE MONKEY WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT HIS TWO HANDS THEN HE COULD PULL OUT ONE FOOT THEN ANOTHER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE HIS BODY TOO
THE NEXT MORNING SHE MADE AN IMAGE OF WAX WHICH LOOKED JUST LIKE A LITTLE BLACK BOY THEN SHE PLACED A LARGE FLAT BASKET ON THE TOP OF THE IMAGE'S HEAD AND IN THE BASKET
AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOTHER HAD TAKEN HER FOR HER OWN CHILD
THE MONKEY WAS PLAYING HIS GUITAR
THEN LAY THEIR FACES ON THE GROUND TILL THEY GROW INTO SNOUTS WHEN AT LAST THEY ARE A HIDEOUS SORT OF LIZARDS EACH OF WHICH BELIEVES HIMSELF THE BEST WISEST AND LOVELIEST BEING IN THE WORLD YEA THE VERY CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE
LET GO MY FOOT LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND MY FOOT
MORNING CAME AND THEY HAD NOT FOUND HER THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE AROSE TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING AGNES BUT DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT PASSED AND NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED OF OR CONCERNING HER
WHEN THEY TAKE THE PART HE TAKES THE WISE WOMAN SAID NOTHING BUT FIXED HER EYES UPON HER AND SOON THE MOTHER HID HER FACE IN HER APRON WEEPING THEN SHE TURNED AGAIN TO AGNES WHO HAD NEVER LOOKED ROUND BUT SAT WITH HER BACK TO BOTH
SHE COULD SEE LYING AT THE ROOT OF IT THE WORM THAT MADE IT FOR SOME SMILES ARE LIKE THE RUDDINESS OF CERTAIN APPLES WHICH IS OWING TO A CENTIPEDE OR
AGNES LOOKED AT IT DID NOT WANT IT WAS INCLINED TO REFUSE IT FROM A BEGGAR BUT THINKING IT WOULD SHOW HER CONSEQUENCE TO ASSERT HER RIGHTS TOOK IT AND DRANK IT UP
BEGGED HIM TO DANCE SOME MORE IF YOU WILL OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN HAVE MORE AIR TO BREATHE I'LL SHOW YOU A NEW DANCE SAID THE MONKEY THE CHILDREN OPENED THE DOOR
ROSAMOND WOULD HAVE UTTERLY DESPISED THE RUDE SIMPLE PLAYTHINGS SHE HAD YET IN ONE RESPECT THEY WERE OF MORE VALUE FAR THAN HERS THE KING BOUGHT ROSAMOND'S WITH HIS MONEY
THERE BY THE HOLE IN THE GROUND AT LAST HE BECAME TIRED OF WAITING AND WENT AWAY AFTER THAT THE MAN TRIED HARDER THAN EVER TO CATCH THE MONKEY
WHEN THE LITTLE BOY WAS RUBBING HIS EYES TO GET THE DIRT OUT OF THEM THE MONKEY MADE A SUDDEN DASH OUT OF THE CAVE AND ESCAPED TO THE TREE TOPS WHEN THE MAN RETURNED THE LITTLE BOY DID NOT DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THE MAN WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED
NEITHER WAS SHE GREEDY AFTER NICE THINGS BUT CONTENT AS WELL SHE MIGHT BE WITH THE HOMELY FOOD PROVIDED FOR HER NOR WAS SHE BY NATURE PARTICULARLY SELF WILLED OR DISOBEDIENT SHE GENERALLY DID WHAT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WISHED AND BELIEVED WHAT THEY TOLD HER
THE OTHER HAND REMAINED FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THE WAX THEN THE MONKEY CALLED OUT O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY LET GO MY TWO HANDS LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I WILL GIVE YOU A KICK WITH MY FOOT THE IMAGE OF WAX
DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A KICK WITH HIS FOOT AND HIS FOOT REMAINED STUCK FAST IN THE WAX
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID TO THE POOR WOMAN THE MOTHER WENT TO THE DOOR AND CALLED AFTER HER AS SHE TOILED SLOWLY UP THE HILL BUT SHE NEVER TURNED HER HEAD AND THE MOTHER WENT BACK INTO HER COTTAGE
AND WHILE AGNES HAD BUT FEW THINGS NOT SEEING MANY THINGS ABOUT HER AND NOT EVEN KNOWING THAT THERE WERE MANY THINGS ANYWHERE SHE DID NOT WISH FOR MANY THINGS AND WAS THEREFORE NEITHER COVETOUS NOR AVARICIOUS
THE MONKEY WAITED AND WAITED FOR THE MAN TO GO AWAY BUT THE MAN DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER A WHILE THE MAN BECAME THIRSTY AND WENT TO GET A DRINK HE LEFT HIS LITTLE BOY IN HIS PLACE TO WATCH FOR THE MONKEY
JUST PUT YOUR EYES DOWN TO THE DOOR OF MY LITTLE CAVE AND I'LL LET YOU SEE THE MONKEY DANCE LITTLE BOY SAID THE MONKEY THE LITTLE BOY PUT HIS EYES DOWN CLOSE TO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
AND ONE DISTORTED TO SILLINESS BY SELF COMPLACENCY TRUE THERE IS MORE HOPE OF HELPING THE ANGRY CHILD OUT OF HER FORM OF SELFISHNESS THAN THE CONCEITED CHILD OUT OF HERS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE CONCEITED CHILD
THAT AT LENGTH HER PARENTS FEARED TO THWART HER IN ANY THING KNOWING WELL THAT SHE WOULD NEVER GIVE IN BUT THERE ARE VICTORIES FAR WORSE THAN DEFEATS AND TO OVERCOME AN ANGEL TOO GENTLE TO PUT OUT ALL HIS STRENGTH
THE MONKEY AND HIS GUITAR WERE SHUT UP IN THE BOX AND THERE INSIDE THE BOX THE MONKEY PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
EVERY TIME THE MAN HEARD THE MONKEY PLAY THE GUITAR HE WOULD COME NEAR AND TRY TO CATCH HIM THE MONKEY GREW AFRAID OF THE MAN SO AFRAID THAT HE GAVE UP PLAYING HIS GUITAR AT ALL
THE WISE WOMAN HAD HER EYE UPON HER SHE SAW THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL MUST BE DONE ELSE SHE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WHO KNEEL TO THEIR OWN SHADOWS TILL FEET GROW ON THEIR KNEES THEN GO DOWN ON THEIR HANDS TILL THEIR HANDS GROW INTO FEET
HER HAIR HUNG IN TANGLES FROM HER HEAD HER CLOTHES WERE TATTERED AND THROUGH THE RENTS HER SKIN SHOWED IN MANY PLACES HER CHEEKS WERE WHITE AND WORN THIN WITH HUNGER THE HOLLOWS WERE DARK UNDER HER EYES AND THEY STOOD OUT SCARED AND WILD
MEANTIME THE WISE WOMAN WAS BUSY AS SHE ALWAYS WAS AND HER BUSINESS NOW WAS WITH THE CHILD OF THE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS AWAY IN THE NORTH HER NAME WAS AGNES HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE POOR AND COULD NOT GIVE HER MANY THINGS
HOW THE MONKEY ESCAPED BEING EATEN ONCE UPON A TIME
THE MONKEY CALLED OUT LET GO MY HAND AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I'LL GIVE YOU A HARD HARD BLOW WITH MY OTHER HAND THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A HARD HARD BLOW WITH HIS OTHER HAND
THE MONKEYS WERE TO CLIMB UP INTO THE BIGGEST TREE AND PILE THEMSELVES ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER UNTIL THEY MADE A PYRAMID OF MONKEYS THE MONKEY WITH THE VERY LOUDEST VOICE OF ALL WAS TO BE ON TOP
BUT THE WISE WOMAN HAD BEEN TO THE COTTAGE AND HAD SEEN HER SITTING ALONE WITH SUCH A SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AS WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE STARTLING TO HER IF SHE HAD EVER BEEN STARTLED AT ANY THING FOR THROUGH THAT SMILE
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OLD WOMAN TO GATHER THE BANANAS HERSELF SO SHE MADE A BARGAIN WITH THE LARGEST MONKEY SHE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD GATHER THE BUNCHES OF BANANAS FOR HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HALF OF THEM THE MONKEY GATHERED THE BANANAS
ONE STANZA THAT I USED TO CROON OVER GAVE ME THE FEELING OF BEING ROCKED IN A BOAT ON A STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL OCEAN FROM WHOSE FAR OFF SHORES THE SUNRISE BECKONED AT ANCHOR LAID REMOTE FROM HOME
THAT'S QUITE TRUE MY DEAR SAID MISSUS RAY A MOST IMPORTANT STEP AND ONE THAT REQUIRES THE MOST EXACT CIRCUMSPECTION ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG WOMAN
BUT I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT HER MIND HAD NOT BEEN WHOLLY INTENT UPON IT DURING THE LONG ABSENCE OF HER MOTHER AND SISTER SHE HAD STRUGGLED FOR A TIME TO IGNORE THE SLIGHT FACT THAT HER COMPANIONS WERE AWAY GOSSIPING WITH THE NEIGHBOURING FARMER'S WIFE
WHEN SHE HAD SO OBSTINATELY REFUSED THAT INVITATION AND HAD INSTEAD GONE OUT TO MEET THE TAPPITT GIRLS AND HAD MET WITH THEM THE YOUNG MAN OF WHOM HER SISTER HAD
IT SEEMS TO BE CERTAIN THAT HE IS AN INDUSTRIOUS STEADY YOUNG MAN EVERYBODY SEEMS TO SPEAK WELL OF HIM NOW WELL MOTHER I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST HIM NOT A WORD AND IF IT WILL GIVE RACHEL ANY PLEASURE
THEY WERE A GLORIOUS DREAM TO ME AND A ROSE THAT GREW ON A MOUNTAIN MUST SURELY BE PRETTIER THAN ANY OF OUR RED WILD ROSES ON THE HILL SWEET AS THEY WERE I WOULD PLUCK THAT ROSE AND CARRY IT UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE INTO THE TEMPLE
I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW A WORLD COULD BE BEAUTIFUL WHERE THERE WAS NO MORE SEA
TOILING I CRY SWEET SPIRIT COME CELESTIAL BREEZE NO LONGER STAY BUT SPREAD MY SAILS AND SPEED MY WAY SOME OF THE CHOSEN HYMNS OF MY INFANCY THE WORLD RECOGNIZES AMONG ITS NOBLEST TREASURES OF SACRED SONG
SAID MISSUS RAY AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM NO MOTHER I DIDN'T THINK THAT BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING LATE WITH MISSUS STURT SO WE WERE AND REALLY
THE COLOUR CAME TO HER CHEEKS AND SHE THREW UP HER HEAD WITH A GESTURE OF ANGRY PRIDE BUT AT THE MOMENT SHE SAID NOTHING MISSUS RAY SPOKE IT SEEMS TO ME DOROTHEA SHE SAID THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE
YOU HAD BETTER TELL HER MAMMA I SUPPOSE SHE WON'T SET HERSELF AGAINST IT WILL SHE I HOPE NOT MAMMA I SHALL THINK HER VERY ILL NATURED IF SHE DOES BUT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY REAL DIFFERENCE NOW YOU
READING OR REPEATING THEM TO HER WHILE SHE WAS BUSY WITH HER BAKING OR IRONING AND SHE WAS ALWAYS A WILLING LISTENER SHE WAS FOND OF DEVOTIONAL READING BUT HAD LITTLE TIME FOR IT
JESUS SAID HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN AND WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH THOSE WHO LOVED HIM HE IS ALIVE HE LOVES ME HE WILL TELL ME HOW TO BE GOOD I SAID IT OVER TO MYSELF BUT NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE I WAS SURE THAT I LOVED HIM
AUGUSTA WOULD HAVE TURNED BOLDLY AWAY
WHATEVER MAY OPPOSE AND SO I FANCIED THERE WOULD BE LIONS IN THE WAY AS THERE WERE IN THE PILGRIM'S AT THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL BUT I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM THEY WOULD NO DOUBT BE CHAINED
BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO THINK AS WELL OF YOUR BROTHER IN LAW AS POSSIBLE
THAT ONE OF DODDRIDGE'S BEGINNING WITH YE GOLDEN LAMPS OF HEAVEN FAREWELL MADE ME FEEL AS IF I HAD JUST BEEN GAZING IN AT SOME WINDOW OF THE MANY MANSIONS ABOVE YE STARS ARE BUT THE SHINING DUST OF MY DIVINE ABODE
I THINK HE HAS DISMISSED MISTER TAPPITT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT SAID MISSUS PRIME I ONLY KNOW THAT THEY'VE QUARRELLED BUT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN
SHE HAD TAKEN A SIDE AGAINST LUKE ROWAN AND COULD NOT RESTRAIN HERSELF FROM ILL NATURED WORDS RACHEL WAS STILL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN SHE HEARD HER LOVER THUS DESCRIBED BUT SHE WOULD NOT CONDESCEND TO PLEAD IN ANSWER TO SUCH A CHARGE
WHERE THE KING SAT AND WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AND THEN HE WOULD TOUCH ME WITH HIS SCEPTRE AND LET ME THROUGH INTO A GARDEN FULL OF FLOWERS THERE WAS NO GARDEN IN THE HYMN I SUPPOSE THE ROSE MADE ME INVENT ONE BUT IT DID READ
AND IT PLEASED HER TO KNOW THAT SO SMALL A CHILD AS I REALLY CARED FOR THE HYMNS SHE LOVED I LEARNED MOST OF THEM AT MEETING I WAS TOLD TO LISTEN TO THE MINISTER BUT AS I DID NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SAYING
MISSUS RAY I FEAR DID NOT FIND THE LITTLE TEA PARTY SO AGREEABLE ON THAT EVENING AS SHE HAD DONE ON THE PREVIOUS OCCASION MISSUS PRIME DID MAKE SOME EFFORT AT CONVERSATION SHE DID ENDEAVOUR TO RECEIVE THE YOUNG MAN AS HER FUTURE BROTHER IN LAW SHE WAS GRACIOUS TO HIM WITH
BUT THAT CHANCE WHICH HAD NOW BEEN SO WONDROUSLY DECIDED IN HER FAVOUR WHEN SHE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST ON THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS VERY QUIET SO QUIET THAT HER SISTER ALMOST THOUGHT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AT HER FUTURE PROSPECTS
FAR MORE THAN HAD EVER COME TO HER FROM MANY A DAY'S CASUAL LOOKING AT ANY OTHER MAN SHE COULD ALMOST BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY MADE AND DESTINED FOR HER BEHOOF SHE BLUSHED EVEN WHILE LYING IN BED AS SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GAIT OF THE MAN AND THE
MISSUS PRIME READS HER RECANTATION ABOVE AN HOUR HAD PASSED AFTER THE INTERRUPTION MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER BEFORE MISSUS RAY AND RACHEL CROSSED BACK FROM THE FARM HOUSE TO THE COTTAGE AND WHEN THEY WENT THEY WENT ALONE
AND THE SENTIMENT TOO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH MISSUS STURT'S CHIVALRIC VIEWS TO ALLOW OF HER ADMITTING THE TRUTH OF ANY SUCH ASSURANCE AS THIS I KNOW SHE SAID I KNOW AND WHEN I READ THEM WORDS IN THE NEWSPAPER I SAID TO THE GUDEMAN THERE
AND I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY TOGETHER FOR VERY MANY YEARS I LOVE RACHEL DEARLY THOUGH I FEAR SHE DOES NOT THINK SO AND ANYTHING I HAVE SAID I HAVE SAID IN LOVE NOT IN ANGER I'M SURE OF THAT DOROTHEA
I THINK MORE GRATEFULLY NOW OF THE VERSES I LEARNED FROM THE BIBLE AND THE HYMN BOOK THAN OF ALMOST ANYTHING THAT CAME TO ME IN THAT TIME OF BEGINNINGS THE WHOLE HYMN BOOK WAS NOT FOR ME THEN ANY MORE THAN THE WHOLE BIBLE
ARE WE NOT TAUGHT THAT IT IS BETTER FOR US THAT IT SHOULD BE SO HAVE NOT YOU AND I MOTHER HAD A SAD TIME OF IT IT WOULD BE ALL SAD ENOUGH IF THIS WERE TO BE THE END OF IT
AND SOMETIMES I LEARNED TWO OR THREE HYMNS IN A FORENOON OR AN AFTERNOON FINDING IT SO EASY I THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND LEARN THE WHOLE THERE WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THEM INCLUDED IN THE PSALMS THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD BOOKS AND THE SELECT HYMNS
I TRIED LONG AFTERWARD THINKING THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO BUILD UP A WALL OF DIFFICULT DOCTRINES OVER MY SPRING BLOSSOMS AS IF THEY NEEDED PROTECTION BUT THE SWEET LIGHT WAS NEVER WHOLLY STIFLED OUT
THOUGH I DID NOT ALWAYS KEEP MY FACE TURNED TOWARDS IT AND I KNOW NOW THAT JUST TO LET HIS LIFEGIVING SMILE SHINE INTO THE SOUL IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE THEORIES WE CAN INVENT ABOUT HIM
AND WOULD HAVE DIVESTED HERSELF OF HER CROAK AND SPOKEN JOYOUSLY HAD SUCH MODE OF SPEECH BEEN POSSIBLE TO HER BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THOUGH SHE WOULD PERMIT NO SUCH FORESHADOWINGS AS THOSE AT WHICH HER MOTHER HAD HINTED
THOUGH I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WILL THE LEAST IN THE WORLD BUT IF IT WOULD SHE MAY KNOW THAT I THINK SHE HAS DONE
HAD I NOT KNOWN THAT EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY BUT THE LIGHT DOES NOT STREAM DOWN EVEN INTO A BABY'S SOUL WITH EQUAL BRIGHTNESS ALL THE TIME EARTH DRAWS HER DARK CURTAINS TOO SOON OVER THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN
BUT TO THIS BOTH MARTHA AND CHERRY OBJECTED WE HAVE HEARD OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT SAID MARTHA AND WE CONGRATULATE YOU
SINCE THE EVENING ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HIM STANDING WITH RACHEL IN THE CHURCHYARD SHE KNEW NOTHING AGAINST HIM BUT SHE HAD THEN MADE UP HER MIND THAT HE WAS PERNICIOUS AND SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO OWN THAT SHE HAD BEEN WRONG IN THAT OPINION
WHENEVER I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN CROSS OR SELFISH I HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT JESUS AS IF HE WERE A DEAD MAN ONE WHO DIED A GREAT WHILE AGO WHOSE DEATH MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE TO US I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW
THE DOORS OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE WERE OPENED WIDE AGAIN BY THE ONLY HAND THAT HOLDS THE KEY THE WORLD WAS ALL BRIGHT AND FRESH ONCE MORE IT WAS AS IF THE MAY SUN HAD SUDDENLY WAKENED THE FLOWERS IN AN OVERSHADOWED WAYSIDE NOOK
THAT NIGHT AND I ALMOST DOUBT WHETHER RACHEL SLEPT AT ALL IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IN THE PRESENT CONDITION OF HER LIFE SLEEP COULD HARDLY BE NECESSARY
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT BETTER FOR HER OR FOR HIM EITHER THAT THEY SHOULD BE KEPT APART SEEING THAT THEY REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER NO I DON'T SAY THAT IF THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER OF COURSE IT IS RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD MARRY I ONLY WISH WE HAD KNOWN HIM LONGER
DURING THAT HOUR THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN MISSUS STURT'S PARLOUR AND WHEN AT LAST THEY GOT UP TO GO THEY DID NOT PRESS LUKE ROWAN TO GO WITH THEM MISSUS PRIME WAS AT THE COTTAGE
NOW HE WAS THERE ON PURPOSE TO TAKE HER WITH HIM AND SHE WENT FORTH WITH HIM LEANING LOVINGLY ON HIS ARM WHILE YET CLOSE UNDER HER SISTER'S EYES
HE LOVES YOU AND WANTS YOU TO LOVE HIM HE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND AND HE WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BE GOOD MY HEART BEAT FAST I COULD HARDLY KEEP BACK THE TEARS THE NEW TESTAMENT THEN DID REALLY MEAN WHAT IT SAID
AMEN SAID MISSUS RAY SOLEMNLY IT WAS THUS THAT MISSUS PRIME READ HER RECANTATION WHICH WAS REPEATED ON THAT EVENING TO RACHEL WITH SOME LITTLE SOFTENING TOUCHES YOU WON'T BE LIVING TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE AFTER A BIT
NOW THAT SHE IS TO BE SETTLED IN LIFE AS A MARRIED WOMAN
SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED FAR AWAY IN THE PAST BUT ONE DAY A STRANGE MINISTER CAME INTO THE SABBATH SCHOOL IN OUR LITTLE CHAPEL AND SPOKE TO US CHILDREN ABOUT HIM OH SO DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN HE SAID JESUS IS NOT DEAD HE IS ALIVE
WAS WHEN SOME ONE TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT I DID NOT LOVE GOD I INSISTED ALMOST TEARFULLY THAT I DID BUT I WAS TOLD THAT IF I DID TRULY LOVE HIM I SHOULD ALWAYS BE GOOD I KNEW I WAS NOT THAT
AFTER HE DRANK TEA HERE THAT NIGHT ONLY MISTER COMFORT TOLD ME IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE NOT TO SEE HOW THINGS WENT A LITTLE BEFORE YOU YOU UNDERSTAND DEAREST YES I UNDERSTAND
DONE UP VERY PRETTILY WITH BLUE AND WHITE RIBBONS ROUND HIS HORNS BUT STILL AN OX PREPARED FOR SACRIFICE BUT THE GIRL FEELS HERSELF TO BE EXALTED FOR THOSE FEW WEEKS AS A CONQUEROR AND TO BE CARRIED ALONG IN AN OVATION OF WHICH THAT BUCOLIC VICTIM
AND THAT ONLY SO CAN YOUNG OR OLD RECEIVE THE KINGDOM OF GOD AS A LITTLE CHILD I BELIEVE THAT ONE GREAT REASON FOR A CHILD'S LOVE OF HYMNS SUCH AS MINE WAS IS THAT THEY ARE EITHER ADDRESSED TO A PERSON
I'LL GO TO JESUS THOUGH MY SIN HATH LIKE A MOUNTAIN ROSE I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS LAST LINE WAS BAD GRAMMAR BUT THOUGHT THAT THE SIN IN QUESTION WAS SOMETHING PRETTY THAT LOOKED LIKE A MOUNTAIN ROSE MOUNTAINS I HAD NEVER SEEN
IT SEEMED LIKE A LOVELY STORY THE LOVELIEST IN THE WORLD
AND IT WAS NECESSARY THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE EXPLAINED TO HER BEFORE SHE WAS ASKED TO GIVE HER HAND TO HER FUTURE BROTHER IN LAW THE FARMER HAD COME IN AND HAD JOKED HIS JOKE AND MISSUS STURT HAD CLACKED OVER THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE A BROOD OF CHICKENS OF HER OWN HATCHING
BUT SHE NOW DECLARED TO HERSELF THAT SHE HAD BEEN A WEAK FOOL IN THUS ATTEMPTING TO DECEIVE HERSELF THAT SHE HAD LOVED HIM FROM THE FIRST OR AT ANY RATE FROM THAT EVENING WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER OF THE BEAUTY OF THE CLOUDS
SHE HAD BEEN LOUD AND DEFIANT IN HER DENUNCIATION WHEN SHE HAD FIRST SUSPECTED RACHEL OF HAVING A LOVER SINCE THAT SHE HAD UNDERGONE SOME TROUBLES OF HER OWN BY WHICH THE TONE OF HER REMONSTRANCES HAD BEEN NECESSARILY MODERATED
WITH SOME I WAS CAUGHT BY A MELODIOUS ECHO OR A SONOROUS RING WITH OTHERS BY THE HINT OF A PICTURE OR A STORY OR BY SOME SACRED SUGGESTION THAT ATTRACTED ME I KNEW NOT WHY
AND THE ACTION HAD BEEN SO QUICK THAT SHE HAD HARDLY FOUND A MOMENT FOR THOUGHT COULD IT BE THAT THINGS WERE SO FIXED THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR FURTHER DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD BEEN SCALDED SO CRUELLY THAT SHE STILL FEARED THE HOT WATER
BUT I HAD LEARNED TO READ BEFORE I HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTING UP NUMBERS AND SO WAS BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF MY UNDERTAKING I DID NOT I THINK CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY BUT BECAUSE LITTLE AS I WAS
IN ANSWER TO THIS LUKE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF RACHEL WHEN HE WAS MAKING THAT SPEECH AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT ALL THAT WAS SOFT SAWDER AS HE CALLED IT FOR THE ELECTION BUT THE WORDS WERE TOO APPOSITE TO THE EVENT
OF SOME I WAS FOND JUST BECAUSE I MISUNDERSTOOD THEM AND OF THESE I MADE A FREE VERSION IN MY MIND AS I MURMURED THEM OVER ONE OF MY FIRST FAVORITES WAS CERTAINLY RATHER A SINGULAR CHOICE FOR A CHILD OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS
AND MISSUS RAY HAD SMILED AND CRIED AND SOBBED AND LAUGHED TILL SHE HAD BECOME ALMOST HYSTERICAL THEN SHE HAD JUMPED UP FROM HER SEAT SAYING OH DEAR WHAT WILL DOROTHEA THINK HAS BECOME OF US AFTER THAT RACHEL INSISTED UPON GOING
ALMOST THE FIRST DECIDED TASTE IN MY LIFE WAS THE LOVE OF HYMNS COMMITTING THEM TO MEMORY WAS AS NATURAL TO ME AS BREATHING I FOLLOWED MY MOTHER ABOUT WITH THE HYMN BOOK WATTS AND SELECT
SHE HAS ONLY TO PUT OUT HER HAND THE LEAST LITTLE BIT IN THE WORLD AND I WILL GO THE REST OF THE WAY AS FOR HER LIVING I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL BE BEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE LUKE SAYS THAT OF COURSE YOU'LL COME AND LIVE WITH US
AND THOSE HEART THROBBINGS IN WHICH HER SISTER HAD SO UNFORTUNATELY BEEN ALLOWED TO INDULGE SHE FELT ALL BUT SURE THAT SOME TIDINGS OF LUKE ROWAN HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN MISSUS STURT'S BUDGET OF NEWS AND SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO THINK WELL OF LUKE ROWAN
I THINK THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A GLEAM OF TRIUMPH IN HER FACE AS SHE PUT HER HAND WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE WELL ROUND HER LOVER'S ARM GIRLS DO TRIUMPH IN THEIR LOVERS IN THEIR ACKNOWLEDGED AND PERMITTED LOVERS AS YOUNG MEN TRIUMPH IN THEIR LOVES WHICH ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED OR PERHAPS PERMITTED
ONLY I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER DO AWAY WITH CIDER IN DEVONSHIRE BECAUSE OF THE APPLE TREES BUT IF PEOPLE ARE TO DRINK BEER IT STANDS TO REASON THAT GOOD BEER WILL BE BETTER THAN BAD ALL THIS TIME RACHEL HAD NOT SPOKEN A WORD
BUT WHY NEED SHE SLEEP NOW THAT EVERY THOUGHT WAS A NEW PLEASURE THERE WAS NO MOMENT THAT SHE HAD EVER PASSED WITH HIM THAT HAD NOT TO BE RECALLED THERE WAS NO WORD OF HIS THAT HAD NOT TO BE RE WEIGHED
OF RECANTING HER ERROR IN REGARD TO LUKE ROWAN'S CHARACTER SHE WISHED TO GIVE IN HER ADHESION TO THE MARRIAGE TO BE KNOWN TO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED ITS FITNESS SO THAT SHE COULD WITH SOME TRUE WORD OF SISTERLY LOVE WISH HER SISTER WELL
SHE HAS HAD A SAD TIME OF IT DOROTHEA SINCE WE MADE HER WRITE THAT LETTER TO HIM A VERY SAD TIME OF IT
HER HEART WAS SORE WITH THE OLD HURT AS THE HEAD THAT HAS ACHED WILL BE STILL SORE WHEN THE ACTUAL MALADY HAS PASSED AWAY SHE LONGED FOR HOURS OF ABSOLUTE QUIET IN WHICH SHE MIGHT MAKE HERSELF SURE THAT HER MALADY HAD ALSO PASSED AWAY
IT WAS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SECRET BETWEEN US TWO I FELT HIM SO ALIVE AND SO NEAR HE WANTED ME TO BE GOOD AND I COULD BE I WOULD BE FOR HIS SAKE THAT STRANGER NEVER KNEW HOW HIS LOVING WORD HAD TOUCHED A CHILD'S HEART
BUT THE DURATION OF THEIR MEAL WAS TERRIBLY LONG
AND IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TEXTS HEAVEN SEEMED NEARER BECAUSE SOMEBODY I LOVED WAS UP THERE LOOKING AT ME A BABY IS NOT AFRAID OF ITS FATHER'S EYES THE FIRST REAL UNHAPPINESS I REMEMBER TO HAVE FELT
WHEN HE CAME OUT HERE AND DRANK TEA WITH US THAT EVENING CONTINUED MISSUS RAY I TOOK A LIKING TO HIM MOST UNACCOUNTABLE UNLESS IT WAS THAT I HAD A FORESHADOWING THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE SO NEAR AND DEAR TO ME MOTHER
IF THIS MATTER IS SETTLED RACHEL IT IS SETTLED I THINK SAID RACHEL IF IT IS SETTLED I HOPE THAT IT MAY BE FOR YOUR LASTING HAPPINESS AND ETERNAL WELFARE I HOPE IT WILL SAID RACHEL
WE SHALL HAVE BRIDECAKE FROM THE COTTAGE NOW BEFORE CHRISTMAS FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SO YOU SHALL SAID LUKE SHAKING HANDS WITH HER AS HE WENT OR THE FAULT WILL NOT BE MINE RACHEL AS SHE FOLLOWED HER MOTHER OUT FROM THE FARMYARD GATE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
I HAD NO IDEA OF ITS MEANING BUT MADE UP A LITTLE STORY OUT OF IT WITH MYSELF AS THE HEROINE IT BEGAN WITH THE WORDS COME HUMBLE SINNER IN WHOSE BREAST A THOUSAND THOUGHTS REVOLVE THE SECOND STANZA READ THUS
THAT THRILLED ME WITH REVERENT AWE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST LESSONS TAUGHT IN THE PURITAN SCHOOL THE LESSON OF REVERENCE THE CERTAINTY THAT LIFE MEANT LOOKING UP TO SOMETHING TO SOME ONE GREATER THAN OURSELVES
TO A LIFE FAR ABOVE US WHICH YET ENFOLDED OURS THE THOUGHT OF GOD WHEN HE WAS FIRST SPOKEN OF TO ME SEEMED AS NATURAL AS THE THOUGHT OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER THAT HE SHOULD BE INVISIBLE DID NOT SEEM STRANGE
BUT EVEN NOW SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE HER SISTER SUCH A LOVER AS LUKE ROWAN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE WILLING TO SEE HER SISTER MARRIED BUT THE LOVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DINGY BLACK COATED LUGUBRIOUS
BABY THAT I WAS I SHUT MY LIPS IN A SORT OF RECKLESS DESPAIR AND THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD NOT BE GOOD I MIGHT AS WELL BE NAUGHTY AND ENJOY IT BUT SOMEHOW I COULD NOT ENJOY IT I FELT SORRY AND ASHAMED AND DEGRADED
THE HILL OF ZION YIELDS A THOUSAND SACRED SWEET BEFORE WE REACH THE HEAVENLY FIELDS OR WALK THE GOLDEN STREETS WE WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE A LITTLE NOSEGAY TO MEETING SOMETIMES A PINK OR TWO
IT IS PRETTY TO SEE HER SO HAPPY ISN'T IT NOW SAID MISSUS RAY THE QUESTION FOR THE MOMENT MADE MISSUS PRIME UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALMOST WRETCHED BUT IT GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IN HER HEART SHE DESIRED
BUT I THINK THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH FEAR SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE TRANQUIL IN HER HAPPINESS
NOR HAD HER SISTER UTTERED ANYTHING EXPRESSIVE OF CONGRATULATION OR GOOD WISHES NOW AS MISSUS RAY CEASED THERE CAME A SILENCE IN THE ROOM AND IT WAS INCUMBENT ON THE ELDER SISTER TO BREAK IT
WHAT THE YOUNG MAN THAT WAS DISMISSED FROM MISTER TAPPITT'S IT WAS ILL SAID OF HER VERY ILL SAID AND SO SHE WAS HERSELF AWARE AS SOON AS THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP IT
AND THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER RETURNED ACROSS THE GREEN LEAVING LUKE AT THE FARM HOUSE READY TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE AS SOON AS MISSUS RAY AND RACHEL SHOULD HAVE SAFELY REACHED THEIR HOME I KNEW THEE WAS MINDED STEDFAST TO TAKE HER SAID MISSUS STURT
AND THE FEELING OF SUDDEN ORPHANAGE CAME OVER ME LIKE A BEWILDERING CLOUD YET I WAS SURE THAT I LOVED MY FATHER AND MOTHER EVEN WHEN I WAS NAUGHTY WAS HE HARDER TO PLEASE THAN THEY THEN I HEARD OF A DREADFUL DARK SOMEWHERE
COULD IT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE SHE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO REMAIN SILENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING AND FOR THE NIGHT SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TIME TO THINK OF THIS THING WHICH SHE HAD DONE AND TO ENJOY THE FULL MEASURE OF HER HAPPINESS HITHERTO
USUALLY THE HYMNS FOR WHICH I CARED MOST SUGGESTED NATURE IN SOME WAY FLOWERS TREES SKIES AND STARS WHEN I REPEATED THERE EVERLASTING SPRING ABIDES AND NEVER WITHERING FLOWERS
AND MY HEART BEAT A BRAVE ECHO TO THE WORDS AS I STARTED OFF IN FANCY ON A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS OF MY OWN A HAPPY LITTLE DREAMER TELLING NOBODY THE SECRET OF MY IMAGINARY JOURNEY TAKEN IN SERMON TIME
AND UNDERSTOOD AS LITTLE AS THE THUNDER ITSELF WHICH MY MOTHER TOLD ME WAS GOD'S VOICE SO THAT I BENT MY EAR AND LISTENED EXPECTING TO HEAR IT SHAPED INTO WORDS IT STILL DID GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE PRESENCE OF ONE INFINITE BEING
HAVING ABOUT HIM SOME TRUE ESSENCE OF THE TEARS OF THE VALLEY OF TRIBULATION ALAS HER SISTER'S TASTE WAS QUITE OF ANOTHER KIND
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE THANKFUL ENOUGH WHEN I THINK HOW THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT BUT WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF HIM I THOUGHT HE WAS DANGEROUS TOO BUT YOU DON'T THINK HE IS DANGEROUS NOW MAMMA NO MY DEAR OF COURSE I DON'T AND I NEVER DID
AH MY DEAR CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD OF MISTER ROWAN CALL HIM LUKE MAMMA WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD OF HIM SHE WAS TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GIDDY AND THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING WHY SHOULD SHE THINK EVIL OF PEOPLE WHO TAUGHT HER
IN RACHEL'S PRESENCE SHE COULD NOT HAVE FIRST MADE THIS RECANTATION THOUGH RACHEL SPOKE NO TRIUMPH THERE WAS A TRIUMPH IN HER EYE WHICH PREVENTED ALMOST THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH YIELDING ON THE PART OF DOROTHEA
THE HORROR OF WHICH WAS THAT IT WAS AWAY FROM HIM WHAT IF I SHOULD WAKE SOME MORNING AND FIND MYSELF THERE SOMETIMES I DID NOT DARE TO GO TO SLEEP FOR THAT DREAD AND THE THOUGHT WAS TOO AWFUL TO SPEAK OF TO ANYBODY
AND THAT THE SORENESS WHICH REMAINED CAME ONLY FROM THE MEMORY OF FORMER PAIN BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH PERFECT REST WITHIN HER REACH AS YET WILL YOU TELL HER OR SHALL I SAID MISSUS RAY PAUSING FOR A MOMENT AT THE COTTAGE GATE
YES SAID AUGUSTA THE PLACE ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE AND SO WE THINK IT BEST TO GO
SHE SAID WHEN THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT MY LOVE BECAUSE I THINK MORE OF YOUR WELFARE IN ANOTHER WORLD THAN IN THIS THEN SHE KISSED HER SISTER AND THEY PARTED FOR THE NIGHT
THE DEAR LITTLE SHORT LIVED CHILDREN OF OUR SHIVERING SPRING THEY ALSO WOULD SURELY BE FOUND IN THAT HEAVENLY LAND BLOOMING ON THROUGH THE CLOUDLESS ENDLESS YEAR
KNOW NO IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ONLY IT WILL BE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THEN WITH HALF FRIGHTENED MUFFLED STEPS THEY ENTERED THEIR OWN HOUSE AND JOINED MISSUS PRIME IN THE SITTING ROOM MISSUS PRIME WAS STILL READING THE SERIOUS BOOK
YOU MUSTN'T MIND DOROTHEA THE WIDOW SAID NO MAMMA I DO NOT I MEAN THAT YOU MUSTN'T MIND HER SEEMING TO BE SO HARD SHE MEANS WELL THROUGH IT ALL AND IS AS AFFECTIONATE AS ANY OTHER WOMAN WHY DID SHE SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN DISMISSED
SHE HAS BEHAVED BEST THROUGH IT ALL
TIED ROUND WITH BLUE RIBBONS ON TO HIS HORNS IS THE CHIEF GRACE AND ORNAMENT IN THIS MOOD NO DOUBT BOTH RACHEL AND LUKE ROWAN WENT FORTH LEAVING THE TWO WIDOWS TOGETHER IN THE COTTAGE
RACHEL NOW SHARED HER MOTHER'S ROOM
I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE HYMNS AND HYMNS SOME OF THEM WERE SO PROSY THAT THE WORDS WOULD NOT STAY IN MY MEMORY AT ALL SO I CONCLUDED THAT I WOULD LEARN ONLY THOSE I LIKED I HAD VARIOUS REASONS FOR MY PREFERENCES
SHE HAD MADE A HARD FIGHT WITH HER BOOK PINNING HER EYES DOWN UPON THE PAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THOUGH IN PINNING DOWN HER EYES SHE COULD PIN DOWN HER MIND ALSO BUT BY DEGREES
TONE OF HIS VOICE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER EYES AND EARS FROM THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH SHE HAD MET HIM WHEN SHE HAD GONE TO MISSUS TAPPITT'S PARTY SO CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS TO BE THERE
WHEN SHE SHOULD ONCE HAVE OWNED THAT RACHEL WAS NOT WRONG THEN GRADUALLY SHE COULD BRING HERSELF ROUND TO THE UTTERANCE OF SOME KINDLY EXPRESSION PRETTY SHE SAID YES IT IS PRETTY I DO NOT KNOW THAT
ACCORDING TO THE WORLD'S ORDINARY WICKEDNESS BUT SHE FEARED THAT IT WAS WICKED ACCORDING TO THAT TONE OF MORALS TO WHICH SHE WAS DESIROUS OF TYING HER MOTHER DOWN AS A BOND SLAVE THEY WERE AWAY TALKING ABOUT LOVE AND PLEASURE
SHE REMEMBERED OR FANCIED THAT SHE REMEMBERED HER IDEA OF THE MAN WHEN HER EYE FIRST FELL UPON HIS OUTSIDE FORM SHE WOULD HAVE SWORN THAT HER FIRST GLANCE OF HIM HAD CONVEYED TO HER
IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THAT RACHEL SAW THE TAPPITT GIRLS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FACT OF HER ENGAGEMENT HAD BECOME KNOWN IT WAS IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD BEEN AGAIN WALKING WITH LUKE WHEN SHE MET THEM BUT AT THAT MOMENT SHE WAS ALONE
I HOPE YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN MISTER ROWAN LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIM IT WAS STILL THE VOICE OF A RAVEN MISSUS PRIME AS SHE SPOKE THUS KNEW THAT SHE WAS CROAKING
IT WILL NOT MAKE THE HEROES RETURN SAID CONNACHAR THEY ARE GONE WITHOUT REGARD FOR ME AND WITHOUT HONOR TO ME AND WITHOUT POWER ON MY PART TO PURSUE THEM
IF NATURE THEN BE STANDING ON THE BRINK OF SOME GREAT TRIAL AND WE HEAR THE VOICE OF ONE DEVOTED
HIS DEEP SENSE IN ACTION GIVE IT OUTWARDLY A SHAPE AND THAT OF BENEDICTION TO THE WORLD THEN DOUBT IS NOT AND TRUTH IS MORE THAN TRUTH A HOPE IT IS AND A DESIRE
THEN DEIRDRE SAID THIS LAMENT FAIR ONE LOVED ONE FLOWER OF BEAUTY BELOVED UPRIGHT AND STRONG BELOVED NOBLE AND MODEST WARRIOR FAIR ONE BLUE EYED BELOVED OF THY WIFE
MID THOSE CONCUSSIONS UNCONCERNED TRANQUIL ALMOST AND CARELESS AS A FLOWER GLASSED IN A GREEN HOUSE OR A PARLOUR SHRUB THAT SPREADS ITS LEAVES IN UNMOLESTED PEACE
CAPABLE OF CLEAR TRUTH THE ONE TO BREAK BONDAGE THE OTHER TO BUILD LIBERTY ON FIRM FOUNDATIONS
AND FROM MONT MARTYR SOUTHWARD TO THE DOME OF
HOW BETWEEN HEART AND HEART OPPRESSION THRUST HER MANDATES
CONFUSION STRICKEN BY A HIGHER POWER THAN HUMAN UNDERSTANDING
BUT STRONGER IS SORROW'S SELF CONNACHAR THE PEOPLE THEN GATHERED ROUND THE HEROES BODIES AND ASKED CONNACHAR WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH THE BODIES THE ORDER THAT HE GAVE WAS THAT THEY SHOULD DIG A PIT AND PUT THE THREE BROTHERS IN IT SIDE BY SIDE
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF THAT THAT WILL NOT DO YET SAID CONNACHAR THEY ARE OFF WITHOUT BENDING OF THEIR FEET OR STOPPING OF THEIR STEP WITHOUT HEED OR RESPECT TO ME
WHAT PIERCING SHRILL CRY IS THAT THE MOST MELODIOUS MY EAR EVER HEARD AND THE SHRILLEST THAT EVER STRUCK MY HEART OF ALL THE CRIES I EVER HEARD IT ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE
THE BIRD ASKED TO GET INSIDE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOD OF THE ELEMENTS AND YOU YOURSELF TELL ME THAT ANYTHING THAT IS ASKED IN HIS NAME WE OUGHT TO DO IF YOU WILL NOT ALLOW THE BIRD THAT IS BEING BENUMBED WITH COLD AND DONE TO DEATH WITH HUNGER TO BE LET IN
IS TEMPTED TO REVIEW THE REGION LEFT BEHIND HIM AND IF AUGHT DESERVING NOTICE HAVE ESCAPED REGARD OR BEEN REGARDED WITH TOO CARELESS EYE STRIVES FROM THAT HEIGHT
SEASONED IN THE WARS AND ALL WERE MEN WELL BORN THE CHIVALRY OF FRANCE IN AGE AND TEMPER DIFFERING
EARLIER THAN THAT DID CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER ARISE WITH HIS LITTLE TROOP OF DEAR FRIENDS IN THE DELIGHTFUL TWILIGHT OF THE FRESH AND GENTLE MAY THE DEW WAS HEAVY ON EACH BUSH AND FLOWER AND STEM AS THEY WENT
HE REACHED THE SIDE OF LOCH NESS AND MADE HIS HABITATION THERE HE COULD KILL THE SALMON OF THE TORRENT FROM OUT HIS OWN DOOR AND THE DEER OF THE GREY GORGE FROM OUT HIS WINDOW
RELINQUISHING THE SCRIP AND STAFF AND ALL ENJOYMENT WHICH THE SUMMER SUN SHEDS ROUND THE STEPS OF THOSE WHO MEET THE DAY WITH MOTION CONSTANT AS HIS OWN I WENT PREPARED
STARTED TO RETURN TO ALBA WORD CAME TO THE KING THAT THE COMPANY HE WAS IN PURSUIT OF WERE GONE THE KING THEN SENT FOR DUANAN GACHA DRUID
WHERE DEIRDRE WAS A TROUBLED DREAM CAME TO THE MAN AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE ENJOYED THE WARMTH OF A FAIRY BROCH THE FAIRIES BEING INSIDE PLAYING MUSIC THE HUNTER SHOUTED OUT IN HIS DREAM IF THERE WAS ANY ONE IN THE BROCH TO LET HIM IN FOR THE HOLY ONE'S SAKE
LET ARDEN CLOSE TO ALLEN LIE IF THE DEAD HAD ANY SENSE TO FEEL YE WOULD HAVE MADE A PLACE FOR DEIRDRE THE MEN DID AS SHE TOLD THEM
THAN ANY OTHER NOOK OF ENGLISH GROUND
YOU MAN THAT CAME IN KEEP RESTRAINT ON YOUR TONGUE SAID THE OLD WOMAN IT IS NOT A GREAT THING FOR YOU TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOUR TONGUE QUIET WHEN YOU GET A HOME AND SHELTER OF A HEARTH ON A GLOOMY WINTER'S NIGHT WELL SAID THE HUNTER I MAY DO THAT
THE MAN WAS A RIGHT GOOD MAN AND HE HAD A GOODLY SHARE OF THIS WORLD'S GOODS HE HAD A WIFE BUT NO FAMILY WHAT DID MALCOLM HEAR BUT THAT A SOOTHSAYER HAD COME HOME TO THE PLACE AND AS THE MAN WAS A RIGHT GOOD MAN HE WISHED THAT THE SOOTHSAYER MIGHT COME NEAR THEM
YOU HAVE HERE HID AWAY THEY WOULD NOT LONG LEAVE HER WITH YOU I SWEAR WHAT MEN ARE THESE YOU REFER TO SAID DEIRDRE WELL I WILL TELL YOU YOUNG WOMAN SAID THE HUNTER
OF DEIRDRE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT BUT FOLLOW AFTER HIM
DESPITE THE SUSPICION OF DEIRDRE THE CORACLE WAS PUT TO SEA THE SAIL WAS HOISTED TO IT AND THE SECOND MORROW THEY ARRIVED ON THE WHITE SHORES OF ERIN
IT IS NOT YOU BUT WE THAT WILL GO SAID DARING DROP AND HARDY HOLLY AND FIALLAN THE FAIR IT IS TO US THAT OUR FATHER ENTRUSTED YOUR DEFENCE FROM HARM AND DANGER WHEN HE HIMSELF LEFT FOR HOME AND THE GALLANT YOUTHS
WHERE SILENT ZEPHYRS SPORTED WITH THE DUST OF THE BASTILLE I SATE IN THE OPEN SUN AND FROM THE RUBBISH GATHERED UP A STONE
THAT IS TRUE SAID CONNACHAR LET THREE HUNDRED BRAVE HEROES GO DOWN TO THE ABODE OF THE STRANGERS AND LET THEM BRING HITHER TO ME DEIRDRE AND KILL THE REST CONNACHAR ORDERED THREE HUNDRED ACTIVE HEROES
THE LENGTH OF THE WAY AND ROUGHNESS OF THE ROAD YONDER NOW DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE GLEN IS THE BOTHY WHERE THE WOMAN DWELLS BUT I WILL NOT GO NEARER THAN THIS TO THE OLD WOMAN SAID THE HUNTER CONNACHAR WITH HIS BAND OF KINSFOLK
TO GO DOWN TO THE ABODE OF THE STRANGERS AND TO TAKE DEIRDRE UP WITH THEM AND KILL THE REST THE PURSUIT IS COMING SAID DEIRDRE YES
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WELL FOR HIM TO REMAIN IN ERIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE WAY IN WHICH CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER HIS UNCLE'S SON HAD GONE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF THE WOMAN THOUGH HE HAD NOT MARRIED HER AND HE TURNED BACK TO ALBA THAT IS SCOTLAND
ACCOUTRED FOR THE WORST HE PERISHED FIGHTING IN SUPREME COMMAND UPON THE BORDERS OF THE UNHAPPY LOIRE
TO SANCTION THE PROUD WORKINGS OF THE SOUL AND MOUNTAIN LIBERTY IT COULD NOT BE BUT THAT ONE TUTORED THUS SHOULD LOOK WITH AWE UPON THE FACULTIES OF MAN
BY THE HIGH HEAVEN ABOVE HIM AND BY THE SUN THAT WENDS TO THE WEST THAT HE WILL HAVE NO REST BY DAY NOR SLEEP BY NIGHT
AND IF HE WILL DISPLAY WRATH TOWARDS YOU DISPLAY YE WRATH TOWARDS HIM
DRIED UP THE FLOOD FROM THE PLAIN AND THE THREE SONS OF UISNECH WERE LYING TOGETHER DEAD WITHOUT BREATH OF LIFE SIDE BY SIDE ON THE GREEN MEADOW PLAIN AND DEIRDRE BENDING ABOVE SHOWERING DOWN HER TEARS
MUCH WEALTH HAVE I EXPENDED ON YOU
MID THE HILLS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE SUSPICION OF ANY LIVING PERSON ABOUT THEM AND WITHOUT ANYTHING OCCURRING UNTIL DEIRDRE WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE DEIRDRE GREW LIKE THE WHITE SAPLING STRAIGHT AND TRIM AS THE RASH ON THE MOSS
HE GAVE FORTH THE PIERCING SIGH OF DEATH
THOUGH YOU ARE SO KEEN TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND YOU WOULD SHED OUR BLOOD ALSO CONNACHAR AND THE NOBLE MANLY HANDSOME YOUTHS WITH BEAUTEOUS BROWN LOCKS RETURNED INSIDE WE ARE NOW SAID THEY GOING HOME TO TELL OUR FATHER THAT YOU ARE NOW SAFE
OFT IN SOLITUDE WITH HIM DID I DISCOURSE ABOUT THE END OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND ITS WISEST FORMS
TO GO HOME TO OUR FATHER AND TELL THE DEEDS OF HEROISM WE HAVE DONE THAN ACCEPT ANYTHING ON THESE TERMS FROM YOU
BLAZING ON WHICH WERE MANY PICTURES OF BEASTS AND BIRDS AND CREEPING THINGS LIONS AND LITHE LIMBED TIGERS BROWN EAGLE AND HARRYING HAWK AND ADDER FIERCE AND THE YOUNG HEROES LAID LOW THREE THIRDS OF THE COMPANY
OF NATIONS AND THEIR PASSING INTERESTS IF WITH UNWORLDLY ENDS AND AIMS COMPARED ALMOST INDIFFERENT EVEN THE HISTORIAN'S TALE
AND HAIL AS BEST THE GOVERNMENT OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND
AS A DEADLY MISCHIEF AND A FOUL AND BLACK DISHONOUR FRANCE WAS WEARY OF OH HAPPY TIME OF YOUTHFUL LOVERS THUS THE STORY MIGHT BEGIN
AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS TO KEEP UP THEIR PACE AND THEY KEPT UP THEIR PACE
THE DAY THAT CONNACHAR SENT THE INVITATION TO HIS FEAST WILL BE UNLUCKY FOR US IF WE DON'T GO O DEIRDRE YOU WILL GO THERE SAID FERCHAR MAC RO AND IF CONNACHAR SHOW KINDNESS TO YOU SHOW YE KINDNESS TO HIM
SHE PLACED A SEAT IN THE PLACE FOR SITTING FOOD IN THE PLACE FOR EATING AND DRINK IN THE PLACE FOR DRINKING FOR THE MAN WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE
WENT AFTER THE MEN THAT WENT PAST THE BASE OF THE KNOLL LEAVING HER WOMEN ATTENDANTS THERE ALLEN AND ARDEN HAD HEARD OF THE WOMAN THAT CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER HAD WITH HIM AND THEY THOUGHT
WHEN THE MEN NEARED THEM DEIRDRE REMEMBERED THE LANGUAGE OF THE HUNTSMAN AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF
I STARED AND LISTENED WITH A STRANGER'S EARS TO HAWKERS AND HARANGUERS HUBBUB WILD AND HISSING FACTIONISTS WITH ARDENT EYES IN KNOTS OR PAIRS OR SINGLE
AND OPEN ACCUSATION LEAD TO SENTENCE IN THE HEARING OF THE WORLD AND OPEN PUNISHMENT IF NOT THE AIR BE FREE TO BREATHE IN
AND KNEW THAT SOME ONE WAS LOOKING AT HER FROM THE BACK OF THE DOOR LEAF HE SEIZED ONE OF THE DICE ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM AND FIRED IT THROUGH THE BICKER HOLE AND KNOCKED THE EYE OUT OF GELBAN GREDNACH THE CHEERFUL AND CHARMING RIGHT THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
WENT DOWN TO THE GREEN KNOLL WHERE DEIRDRE DWELT AND HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE BOTHY THE NURSE REPLIED NO LESS THAN A KING'S COMMAND AND A KING'S ARMY COULD PUT ME OUT OF MY BOTHY TO NIGHT AND I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO YOU WERE YOU TO TELL WHO IT IS
LAID STRONGER HOLD DAILY UPON ME MIXED WITH PITY TOO AND LOVE FOR WHERE HOPE IS THERE LOVE WILL BE FOR THE ABJECT MULTITUDE AND WHEN WE CHANCED
BUT SHE WOULD BLUSH FIERY RED OVER IT THE WOMAN THAT HAD CHARGE OF HER GAVE DEIRDRE EVERY INFORMATION AND SKILL OF WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS GROWING FROM ROOT NOR A BIRD SINGING
A GREAT AND GLEEFUL FEAST HE SENT WORD FAR AND WIDE THROUGH ERIN TO ALL HIS KINSPEOPLE TO COME TO THE FEAST
BLESSINGS FOR THAT UPON YOU AND MAY THE GOOD RESULTS ACCRUE TO ME DUANAN I COUNT IT NO LOSS WHAT I SPENT IN THE SCHOOLING AND TEACHING OF YOU NOW DRY UP THE FLOOD AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN BEHOLD DEIRDRE SAID CONNACHAR
FAR AWAY WHERE EYE WILL NOT SEE A SIGHT OF HER NOR EAR HEAR A WORD ABOUT HER THE WOMAN SAID SHE WOULD SO MALCOLM GOT THREE MEN AND HE TOOK THEM AWAY TO A LARGE MOUNTAIN DISTANT AND FAR FROM REACH WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR NOTICE OF ANY ONE
AS SUM AND CROWN OF ALL
OVER THE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF ERIN HOWEVER THEY ARE SAID THE NURSE BE YOU OFF FROM HERE AND TAKE ANOTHER ROAD AND KING OF LIGHT AND SUN IN GOOD SOOTH AND CERTAINTY LITTLE ARE MY THANKS FOR YOURSELF OR FOR HER THAT LET YOU IN
BY AN AUTHORITY DIVINE SANCTIONED OF DANGER DIFFICULTY OR DEATH SUCH CONVERSATION UNDER ATTIC SHADES DID DION HOLD WITH PLATO O RIPENED THUS FOR A DELIVERER'S GLORIOUS TASK
OF HOSPITALITY AND PEACEFUL REST AND WHEN THE PARTNER OF THOSE VARIED WALKS
ALLEN THEN CRIED OUT THAT HE WAS GETTING FAINT AND WELL NIGH GIVING UP
THE DIN OF BOISTEROUS MERRIMENT AND MUSIC'S ROAR IN SUDDEN PROCLAMATION BURST FROM HAUNT OF SATYRS IN SOME VIEWLESS GLADE
AND DO YOU INTERPRET IT TO ME SAID DEIRDRE THEN SHE SANG
WHILE HE WAS INTENT ON WORKS OF LOVE OR FREEDOM OR REVOLVED COMPLACENTLY THE PROGRESS OF A CAUSE WHEREOF HE WAS A PART YET THIS WAS MEEK AND PLACID
TO MAKE THE BEST AMENDS HE MAY SO HAVE WE LINGERED NOW WE START AFRESH WITH COURAGE AND NEW HOPE RISEN ON OUR TOIL FAIR GREETINGS TO THIS SHAPELESS EAGERNESS WHENE'ER IT COMES
I HAD SKIMMED AND SOMETIMES READ WITH CARE THE MASTER PAMPHLETS OF THE DAY NOR WANTED SUCH HALF INSIGHT AS GREW WILD UPON THAT MEAGRE SOIL HELPED OUT BY TALK AND PUBLIC NEWS
ARDEN WAS NOT LONG IN THIS POSTURE WHEN HE DIED BUT THOUGH HE WAS DEAD
BY A BROOK SIDE WE CAME A ROOFLESS PILE AND NOT BY REVERENTIAL TOUCH OF TIME DISMANTLED BUT BY VIOLENCE ABRUPT IN SPITE OF THOSE
ON LIVE BODY IN ERIN DESPITE SWORD OR HELMET SPEAR OR SHIELD BLADE OR MAIL BE THEY EVER SO GOOD DEIRDRE WAS UNWILLING TO LEAVE ALBA
THAT HE NEVER GAVE TO THING TO VISION OR TO CREATURE BUT TO HERSELF
WHETHER IT WAS THAT HE WAS INVITED OR THAT HE CAME OF HIMSELF THE SOOTHSAYER CAME TO THE HOUSE OF MALCOLM ARE YOU DOING ANY SOOTHSAYING SAYS MALCOLM
SHE WAS THE CREATURE OF FAIREST FORM OF LOVELIEST ASPECT AND OF GENTLEST NATURE THAT EXISTED BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN IN ALL IRELAND WHATEVER COLOUR OF HUE SHE HAD BEFORE THERE WAS NOBODY THAT LOOKED INTO HER FACE
INTO HARD ROCKY KNOBS THE SHARPNESS OF SWORD BEING ON THE ONE EDGE AND THE POISON POWER OF ADDERS ON THE OTHER THEN ARDEN CRIED THAT HE WAS GETTING TIRED AND NEARLY GIVING OVER
OR A WAVELESS SEA SOME HERMIT FROM HIS CELL FORTH STRAYED MIGHT PACE IN SYLVAN MEDITATION UNDISTURBED AS ON THE PAVEMENT OF A GOTHIC CHURCH
LIKE THAT WHICH HE A SOLDIER IN HIS IDLER DAY HAD PAID TO WOMAN
HE HAVING WHAT WAS ABOVE THE BEND OF THE TWO SHOULDERS ABOVE THE MEN OF ERIN ALL THE THREE BROTHERS WENT PAST WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF THEM WITHOUT EVEN GLANCING AT THE YOUNG GIRLS ON THE HILLOCK WHAT HAPPENED BUT
BY LITERATURE OR ELEGANCE OR RANK DISTINGUISHED SCARCELY WAS A YEAR THUS SPENT
AND THE AFFECTIONS LEFT WITHOUT A VITAL INTEREST AT THAT TIME MOREOVER THE FIRST STORM WAS OVERBLOWN AND THE STRONG HAND OF OUTWARD VIOLENCE LOCKED UP IN QUIET
AND OF THAT BARREN PRIDE IN THEM WHO BY IMMUNITIES UNJUST
HEAR WHAT WAS SHOWN IN A DREAM TO ME I SAW THREE GREY HAWKS OUT OF THE SOUTH COME FLYING OVER THE SEA AND THE RED DROPS THEY BARE IN THEIR MOUTH THEY WERE DEARER THAN LIFE TO ME
AND THEY SEEMED ARGUMENTS SENT FROM HEAVEN TO PROVE THE CAUSE GOOD PURE
IN THE WOOD NOR A STAR SHINING FROM HEAVEN BUT DEIRDRE HAD A NAME FOR IT BUT ONE THING SHE DID NOT WISH HER TO HAVE EITHER PART OR PARLEY WITH ANY SINGLE LIVING MAN OF THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT ON A GLOOMY WINTER NIGHT
THE CROWDED SOLITUDE WITH LESS REGRET
WITH SO GREAT A THEME TO SPEAK AS I MUST BE COMPELLED TO DO OF ONE SO UNIMPORTANT NIGHT BY NIGHT DID I FREQUENT THE FORMAL HAUNTS OF MEN WHOM IN THE CITY
THEY DID SO SHE CRIED
SAID CONNACHAR GELBAN THE CHEERING AND CHARMING SON OF LOCHLIN'S KING
AFTER A TIME A DAUGHTER WAS BORN TO MALCOLM HE DID NOT ALLOW A LIVING BEING TO COME TO HIS HOUSE ONLY HIMSELF AND THE NURSE HE ASKED THIS WOMAN WILL YOU YOURSELF BRING UP THE CHILD TO KEEP HER IN HIDING
AND THEY WERE HAPPY SO LONG A TIME AS THEY WERE THERE BY THIS TIME THE END OF THE PERIOD CAME AT WHICH DEIRDRE HAD TO MARRY CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER CONNACHAR MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE DEIRDRE
AND I AM NOT QUITE READY TO RECEIVE THEM BUT THERE IS A HOUSE DOWN YONDER WHERE I KEEP STRANGERS AND LET THEM GO DOWN TO IT TO DAY AND MY HOUSE WILL BE READY BEFORE THEM TO MORROW BUT HE THAT WAS UP IN THE PALACE FELT IT LONG
WHEN THOSE TWO VESSELS WITH THEIR DARING FREIGHT
FULL NOBLE FULL MANLY FULL HANDSOME WITH BEAUTEOUS BROWN LOCKS WENT FORTH GIRT WITH BATTLE ARMS FIT FOR FIERCE FIGHT AND CLOTHED WITH COMBAT DRESS FOR FIERCE CONTEST FIT WHICH WAS BURNISHED BRIGHT BRILLIANT BLADED
THE SONS OF HIS OWN FATHER'S BROTHER WILL NOT COME BACK TO THE LAND OF THEIR HOME AND THE SOIL OF THEIR NATIVITY AND TO THE FEAST LIKEWISE AND HE HAS SENT US ON EMBASSY TO INVITE YOU
BUT THE WAIL OF THE WAVE SWANS OF CONNACHAR SAID HIS BROTHERS NO
THAT IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF A DAUGHTER OF YOURS THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF BLOOD SHALL BE SHED THAT HAS EVER BEEN SHED IN ERIN SINCE TIME AND RACE BEGAN AND THE THREE MOST FAMOUS HEROES THAT EVER WERE FOUND WILL LOSE THEIR HEADS ON HER ACCOUNT
WELL I DO NOT MIND TAKING SOOTHSAYING FROM YOU IF YOU HAD SOOTHSAYING FOR ME AND YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IT WELL I WILL DO SOOTHSAYING FOR YOU WHAT KIND OF SOOTHSAYING DO YOU WANT
THAT HE WAS NOT GETTING WORD AS TO HOW MATTERS WERE GOING ON FOR THOSE DOWN IN THE HOUSE OF THE STRANGERS GO YOU GELBAN GREDNACH SON OF LOCHLIN'S KING GO YOU DOWN AND BRING ME INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER HER FORMER HUE AND COMPLEXION ARE ON DEIRDRE
THERE BY NOVELTIES IN SPEECH DOMESTIC MANNERS CUSTOMS GESTURES LOOKS AND ALL THE ATTIRE OF ORDINARY LIFE ATTENTION WAS ENGROSSED
ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS WILL NOT BE WHAT THEY WANT SAID THE HUNTER CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER SENT FOR HIS NEAREST KINSMEN AND HE TOLD THEM OF HIS INTENT THOUGH EARLY ROSE THE SONG OF THE BIRDS MID THE ROCKY CAVES AND THE MUSIC OF THE BIRDS IN THE GROVE
FEMALE FORTITUDE AT DEAREST SEPARATION PATRIOT LOVE AND SELF DEVOTION AND TERRESTRIAL HOPE
AND ASKED OF HIM THE NEWS OF ERIN THE BEST NEWS THAT I HAVE FOR YOU SAID THE HARDY HERO IS THAT CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER IS SETTING FORTH A GREAT SUMPTUOUS FEAST TO HIS FRIENDS AND KINSPEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WIDE EXTENT OF ERIN ALL AND HE HAS VOWED BY THE EARTH BENEATH HIM
WITH BLACK SCOWLING CLOUDS A HUNTER OF GAME WAS WEARILY TRAVELLING THE HILLS AND WHAT HAPPENED BUT THAT HE MISSED THE TRAIL OF THE HUNT AND LOST HIS COURSE AND COMPANIONS A DROWSINESS CAME UPON THE MAN AS HE WEARILY WANDERED OVER THE HILLS
OFT AMID THOSE HAUNTS FROM EARNEST DIALOGUES I SLIPPED IN THOUGHT AND LET REMEMBRANCE STEAL TO OTHER TIMES
WELL SAID THE SOOTHSAYER
DO TEARS START INTO MINE EYES I DO NOT SAY I WEEP I WEPT NOT THEN BUT TEARS HAVE DIMMED MY SIGHT
FROM THE HANDS OF THE KING AND THE YOUTHS ALL FRESH AND TALL AND LITHE AND BEAUTIFUL
AND ALLEN AND ARDEN HIS TWO BROTHERS WHAT LIKE ARE THESE MEN WHEN SEEN IF WE WERE TO SEE THEM SAID DEIRDRE WHY THE ASPECT AND FORM OF THE MEN WHEN SEEN ARE THESE SAID THE HUNTER
WHICH THROUGH FRANCE FULL SPEEDILY RESOUNDED PUBLIC HOPE OR PERSONAL MEMORY OF HIS OWN WORST WRONGS ROUSE HIM BUT HIDDEN IN THOSE GLOOMY SHADES HIS DAYS HE WASTED
WE WILL SAID HIS BROTHERS BUT DEIRDRE DID NOT WISH TO GO WITH FERCHAR MAC RO AND SHE TRIED
HE CAUSED THERE A HILLOCK ROUND AND GREEN TO BE DUG OUT OF THE MIDDLE AND THE HOLE THUS MADE TO BE COVERED CAREFULLY OVER SO THAT A LITTLE COMPANY COULD DWELL THERE TOGETHER THIS WAS DONE DEIRDRE AND HER FOSTER MOTHER DWELT IN THE BOTHY
BY OBJECTS OVER NEAR NOT PRESSED UPON
AND WHILE I WAS LOOKING AT HER THROUGH THE BICKER HOLE ON THE DOOR
AND THE TWO SHOOTS UNITED IN A KNOT ABOVE THE LOCH THE KING ORDERED THE SHOOTS TO BE CUT DOWN AND THIS WAS DONE TWICE UNTIL AT THE THIRD TIME THE WIFE WHOM THE KING HAD MARRIED CAUSED HIM TO STOP THIS WORK OF EVIL
OR OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THEM BACK THIS NIGHT I WILL TRY ANOTHER PLAN ON THEM SAID THE DRUID AND HE PLACED BEFORE THEM A GREY SEA INSTEAD OF A GREEN PLAIN THE THREE HEROES STRIPPED AND TIED THEIR CLOTHES BEHIND THEIR HEADS
A FREE BRIDGE TO YOUR FATHER AND A FREE BRIDGE EACH TO YOU THREE BROTHERS IF YOU COME OVER TO MY SIDE TO NIGHT WELL CONNACHAR WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT OFFER FROM YOU NOR THANK YOU FOR IT GREATER BY FAR DO WE PREFER
HE LOOKED IN THROUGH THE BICKER HOLE ON THE DOOR LEAF NOW SHE THAT HE GAZED UPON USED TO GO INTO A CRIMSON BLAZE OF BLUSHES WHEN ANY ONE LOOKED AT HER
THAT MIGHT SUFFICE TO SHOW WHENCE THE MAIN ORGANS OF THE PUBLIC POWER HAD SPRUNG THEIR TRANSMIGRATIONS WHEN AND HOW ACCOMPLISHED GIVING THUS UNTO EVENTS A FORM AND BODY
TO BRING DEIRDRE FORTH FROM THE GREEN KNOLL WHERE SHE STAYED MANY A YOUTH WAS THERE WHO HAD A LITHE LEAPING AND LISSOM STEP WHEN THEY STARTED WHOSE STEP WAS FAINT FAILING AND FALTERING WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTHY ON ACCOUNT OF
DEIRDRE AND HER WOMEN COMPANIONS WERE ONE DAY OUT ON THE HILLOCK BEHIND THE HOUSE ENJOYING THE SCENE AND DRINKING IN THE SUN'S HEAT WHAT DID THEY SEE COMING BUT THREE MEN A JOURNEYING DEIRDRE WAS LOOKING AT THE MEN THAT WERE COMING AND WONDERING AT THEM
KNOCKED OUT MY EYE WITH ONE OF THE DICE IN HIS HAND BUT OF A TRUTH AND VERITY ALTHOUGH HE PUT OUT EVEN MY EYE IT WERE MY DESIRE STILL TO REMAIN LOOKING AT HER WITH THE OTHER EYE WERE IT NOT FOR THE HURRY YOU TOLD ME TO BE IN SAID GELBAN
INDIFFERENCE THIS WHICH MAY SEEM STRANGE BUT I WAS UNPREPARED WITH NEEDFUL KNOWLEDGE HAD ABRUPTLY PASSED INTO A THEATRE
RECOMPENSE THE TRAVELLER'S PAINS LESS THAN THE
THAN FOR THE HUMBLE BOOK STALLS IN THE STREETS EXPOSED TO EYE AND HAND WHERE'ER I TURNED FRANCE LURED ME FORTH
I DO NOT THINK MUCH OF YOUR LANGUAGE OR YOUR FAITH BUT SINCE I GIVE CREDENCE TO YOUR LANGUAGE AND TO YOUR FAITH WHICH YOU TAUGHT ME I WILL MYSELF LET IN THE BIRD AND DEIRDRE AROSE AND DREW THE BOLT FROM THE LEAF OF THE DOOR AND SHE LET IN THE HUNTER
AND A KISS EACH TO HIS BROTHERS WITH THE CONFUSION THAT SHE WAS IN DEIRDRE WENT INTO A CRIMSON BLAZE OF FIRE AND HER COLOUR CAME AND WENT AS RAPIDLY AS THE MOVEMENT OF THE ASPEN BY THE STREAM SIDE
DEIRDRE KEPT SITTING ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE CONSTANTLY ASKING THE GRAVEDIGGERS TO DIG THE PIT WIDE AND FREE WHEN THE BODIES OF THE BROTHERS WERE PUT IN THE GRAVE DEIRDRE SAID
WHENCE BETTER DAYS TO ALL MANKIND BUT THESE THINGS SET APART WAS NOT THIS SINGLE CONFIDENCE ENOUGH TO ANIMATE THE MIND THAT EVER TURNED A THOUGHT TO HUMAN WELFARE THAT HENCEFORTH
AS IT MADE THE HEART BEAT HIGH AND FILLED THE FANCY WITH FAIR FORMS OLD HEROES AND THEIR SUFFERINGS AND THEIR DEEDS YET IN THE REGAL SCEPTRE AND THE POMP OF ORDERS AND DEGREES
WHEN FOOT HATH CRUSHED THEM HE THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THAT GREAT CHANGE WANDERED IN PERFECT FAITH
WILL BE WITH YOU WE WILL SAID DARING DROP WE WILL SAID HARDY HOLLY WE WILL SAID FIALLAN THE FAIR I HAVE THREE SONS
THEY MUST GO AWAY LEAVE THAT HOUSE AND RETURN TO ALBA
WELL I AM GOING OUT AND WHEN I RETURN I WILL TELL YOU
AND MERRY MODEST MAIDENS FAIR THAT WOULD LIE DOWN AND RISE WITH HER THAT WOULD PLAY AND SPEAK WITH HER DEIRDRE WAS CLEVER IN MAIDENLY DUTIES AND WIFELY UNDERSTANDING AND CONNACHAR THOUGHT HE NEVER SAW WITH BODILY EYE A CREATURE THAT PLEASED HIM MORE
AND I HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DESIRED ME
AND AT THE SIGHT MY FRIEND IN AGITATION SAID TIS AGAINST THAT THAT WE ARE FIGHTING
LANDED IN ERIN FERCHAR MAC RO SENT WORD TO CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER THAT THE MEN WHOM HE WANTED WERE COME AND LET HIM NOW SHOW KINDNESS TO THEM WELL SAID CONNACHAR
LOVELY TO ME AT THE TRYSTING PLACE CAME THY CLEAR VOICE THROUGH THE WOODS OF IRELAND I CANNOT EAT OR SMILE HENCEFORTH BREAK NOT TO DAY MY HEART SOON ENOUGH SHALL I LIE WITHIN MY GRAVE STRONG ARE THE WAVES OF SORROW
MARCHED THROUGH THE WOOD WITHOUT HALT OR HESITATION
AND CONNACHAR SAID TO FERCHAR
TO GIVE SCHOOLING AND LEARNING AND MAGIC MYSTERY TO YOU I'LL HOLD YOU TO ACCOUNT IF THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY FROM ME TO DAY WITHOUT CARE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OR REGARD FOR ME WITHOUT CHANCE OF OVERTAKING THEM AND WITHOUT POWER TO STOP THEM
THROUGH PARIS LAY MY READIEST COURSE AND THERE SOJOURNING A FEW DAYS I VISITED IN HASTE EACH SPOT OF OLD OR RECENT FAME THE LATTER CHIEFLY
WAS THE STATE OF THINGS MEANWHILE THE CHIEF OF MY ASSOCIATES STOOD PREPARED FOR FLIGHT
SOCIETIES POLISHED IN ARTS AND IN PUNCTILIO VERSED WHENCE AND FROM DEEPER CAUSES ALL DISCOURSE OF GOOD AND EVIL
CONNACHAR CAME OUT IN HASTE AND CRIED WITH WRATH WHO IS THERE ON THE FLOOR OF FIGHT SLAUGHTERING MY MEN WE THE THREE SONS OF FERCHAR MAC RO WELL SAID THE KING
THAT I AM SETTING FORTH A GREAT AND GLEEFUL FEAST TO MY FRIENDS AND KINSPEOPLE
THE HUNTER WENT AWAY
HE GET DIRECTIONS FROM ME AS TO WHERE SHE IS DWELLING AND WILL YOU DIRECT ME TO WHERE SHE DWELLS AND THE REWARD OF YOUR DIRECTING ME WILL BE AS GOOD AS THE REWARD OF YOUR MESSAGE SAID THE KING WELL I WILL DIRECT YOU O KING
SEVEN ARE THEY SEVEN ARE THEY IN THE OCEAN DEEP SEVEN ARE THEY BATTENING IN HEAVEN SEVEN ARE THEY BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN OF THESE SEVEN THE FIRST IS THE SOUTH WIND
THAT IT IS THE BIBLICAL TREE OF LIFE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HIS TRANSLATIONS OF CERTAIN VITAL WORDS HOWEVER
IS OF LATER CHARACTERIZATION THAN THE FIRST PAIR OF PRIMITIVE DEITIES WHO SYMBOLIZED THE DEEP
BEGINS TO RISE EARLY IN MARCH AND REACHES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN MAY BEFORE THE END OF JUNE IT AGAIN SUBSIDES MORE SLUGGISH IN MOVEMENT
THE EUPHRATES INDEED WAS HAILED AS A CREATOR OF ALL THAT GREW ON ITS BANKS O THOU RIVER WHO DIDST CREATE ALL THINGS WHEN THE GREAT GODS DUG THEE OUT THEY SET PROSPERITY UPON THY BANKS
FORCING THEIR WAY WITH BANEFUL WINDSTORMS MIGHTY DESTROYERS THE DELUGE OF THE STORM GOD
ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT BEAST IN SEA LOCH OR RIVER IN A CLASS OF LEGENDS SPECIALLY CONNECTED WITH THE WORSHIP OF ATARGATIS WROTE PROFESSOR ROBERTSON SMITH THE DIVINE LIFE OF THE WATERS RESIDES IN THE SACRED FISH THAT INHABIT THEM
KEKUI AND HIS CONSORT KEKUIT AND KERH AND HIS CONSORT KERHET MAN ALWAYS HAS FASHIONED HE SAYS AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL FASHION HIS GOD OR GODS IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND HE HAS ALWAYS HAVING REACHED A CERTAIN STAGE IN DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCIATED WITH BEL ENLIL WAS BELTIS LATER KNOWN AS BELTU THE LADY SHE APPEARS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE OTHER GREAT GODDESSES ISHTAR NANA
CARRIED A LIGHTNING TRIDENT AND CAUSED EARTHQUAKES HE WAS A BROTHER OF ZEUS THE SKY AND ATMOSPHERE DEITY AND HAD BULL AND HORSE FORMS AS A HORSE HE PURSUED DEMETER
AND IT MAY BE THAT THEY INDUCED OR ENCOURAGED SEMITIC AND OTHER RAIDERS TO OVERTHROW GOVERNMENTS AND FORM MILITARY ARISTOCRACIES SO THAT THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT OBTAIN NECESSARY CONCESSIONS AND ACHIEVE A DEGREE OF POLITICAL ASCENDANCY IT DOES NOT FOLLOW HOWEVER
DAGAN AND DAGON ARE ACCIDENTAL
HE WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE IN A TRIAD IN WHICH HE FIGURED AS EARTH GOD WITH ANU AS GOD OF THE SKY
THE PHILISTINES CAME FROM CRETE AND IF THEIR DAGON WAS IMPORTED FROM THAT ISLAND HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH POSEIDON WHOSE WORSHIP EXTENDED THROUGHOUT GREECE THIS GOD OF THE SEA WHO IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE ROMAN NEPTUNE
FLOWED LIKE THE LETTER S TOWARDS LARSA AND THEN REJOINED THE RIVER IT IS BELIEVED TO MARK THE COURSE FOLLOWED IN THE EARLY SUMERIAN PERIOD BY THE EUPHRATES RIVER WHICH HAS MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD MANY MILES BEYOND THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES THAT WERE ERECTED ON ITS BANKS
THESE SEVEN DEMONS WERE ALSO THE MESSENGERS OF ANU WHO ALTHOUGH SPECIALIZED AS A SKY GOD IN MORE THAN ONE PANTHEON
HE RESEMBLED THE INDIAN VISHNU THE PRESERVER WHILE BEL ENLIL RESEMBLED SHIVA THE DESTROYER AND ANU THE FATHER SUPREME BRAHMA THE CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN EXACT ADJUSTMENT BEING DUE PERHAPS TO SUMERIAN POLITICAL CONDITIONS
IN SHAPE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A FISH IT LIES BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT RIVERS THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE AT ITS BROADEST PART
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM A DEMON
IT IS REFERRED TO IN THE FRAGMENTS OF EARLY LITERATURE WHICH HAVE SURVIVED AS THE SPLENDID HOUSE SHADY AS THE FOREST THAT NONE MAY ENTER THE MYTHOLOGICAL SPELL EXERCISED BY ERIDU IN LATER TIMES
THIS RESINOUS SUBSTANCE IS FOUND IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH IT BUBBLES UP THROUGH CREVICES OF ROCKS ON RIVER BANKS AND FORMS SMALL PONDS TWO FAMOUS SPRINGS AT MODERN HIT ON THE EUPHRATES HAVE BEEN DRAWN UPON FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
GIVEN TO HIS GODS WIVES AND OFFSPRING BUT THE NATURE OF THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE WIVES OF THE GODS DEPENDS UPON THE NATURE OF THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN THE HOUSEHOLDS OF THOSE WHO WRITE THE LEGENDS AND THE TRADITIONS OF THE GODS
HIS WORSHIP WAS CERTAINLY OF GREAT ANTIQUITY HAMMURABI WRITES PROFESSOR PINCHES SEEMS TO SPEAK OF THE EUPHRATES AS BEING THE BOUNDARY OF DAGAN WHOM HE CALLS HIS CREATOR IN LATER INSCRIPTIONS THE FORM DAGUNA
A FISH GOD MAY ALSO BE A CORN GOD A LAND ANIMAL GOD AND A GOD OF OCEAN AND THE SKY
THE BABYLONIANS BECAME EXPERT ENGINEERS AND EXPERIENCED AGRICULTURISTS THE MAKERS OF BRICKS THE BUILDERS OF CITIES THE FRAMERS OF LAWS
EVIL SPIRITS ACCORDING TO A BABYLONIAN CHANT WERE THE BITTER VENOM OF THE GODS THOSE ATTACHED TO A DEITY AS ATTENDANTS APPEAR TO REPRESENT THE ORIGINAL ANIMISTIC GROUP FROM WHICH HE EVOLVED
BESIDES LOCAL GODS COULD NOT BE IGNORED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR POPULARITY AS A RESULT
THE SAGE AT ONCE LIFTED UP THE FISH AND PLACED IT IN A JAR OF WATER IT GRADUALLY INCREASED IN BULK AND HE TRANSFERRED IT NEXT TO A TANK AND THEN TO THE RIVER GANGES
NU AND HIS CONSORT NUT
SUPREME AT MEMPHIS THE SUN GOD RA AT HELIOPOLIS AND THE CAT GODDESS BAST AT BUBASTIS THE VARIOUS LOCAL SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN DEITIES HAD DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS
THE EMBODIMENT OR THE WATER SPIRIT BY LEADING HIM AS THE INDIAN MANU LED THE CREATOR AND PRESERVER IN FISH FORM FROM RIVER TO WATER POT WATER POT TO POND OR CANAL AND THEN AGAIN TO RIVER AND OCEAN
AN ATMOSPHERIC DEITY HE SHARES THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE INDIAN INDRA THE THUNDER AND RAIN GOD AND VAYU THE WIND GOD
IN THE ASHMOLEAN MUSEUM OXFORD BEARING AN INSCRIPTION WHICH HE READS AS BAAL DAGON NEAR THE NAME IS AN EAR OF CORN AND OTHER SYMBOLS SUCH AS THE WINGED SOLAR DISC A GAZELLE AND SEVERAL STARS BUT THERE IS NO FISH
WHILE AT HERMOPOLIS THE LEADER WAS THE LUNAR GOD THOTH PROFESSOR BUDGE IS OF OPINION THAT BOTH THE SUMERIANS AND THE EARLY EGYPTIANS DERIVED THEIR PRIMEVAL GODS FROM SOME COMMON BUT EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT SOURCE
INDEED THESE CONSTITUTED THE BASIS OF SUMERIAN PROSPERITY CONQUERORS HAVE EVER SOUGHT REWARD NOT MERELY IN SPOIL BUT ALSO THE SERVICES OF THE CONQUERED IN NORTHERN BABYLONIA THE INVADERS APPARENTLY FOUND IT NECESSARY
NOT MERELY AS A PRODUCER OF CROPS HIS WORD BECAME THE CREATIVE FORCE HE NAMED THOSE THINGS HE DESIRED TO BE AND THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE
THE BESTOWER OF BLESSINGS SKILFUL ENGINEERS HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF WATER DISTRIBUTION BY IRRIGATING SUN PARCHED AREAS AND PREVENTING THE EXCESSIVE FLOODING OF THOSE DISTRICTS WHICH ARE NOW RENDERED IMPASSABLE SWAMPS WHEN THE RIVERS OVERFLOW
THE CHIEF GOD WAS ENLIL WHOSE NAME IS TRANSLATED LORD OF MIST LORD OF MIGHT AND LORD OF DEMONS BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES HE WAS A STORM GOD AND A WAR GOD AND LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
IN EGYPT THE MOTHER OF MENDES IS DEPICTED CARRYING A FISH UPON HER HEAD SHE LINKS WITH ISIS AND HATHOR
PTAH MOULDED THE FIRST MAN ON HIS POTTER'S WHEEL HE ALSO MOULDED THE SUN AND MOON HE SHAPED THE UNIVERSE AND HAMMERED OUT THE COPPER SKY
THE BUCKETS OR SKIN BAGS WERE ROPED TO A WEIGHTED BEAM WITH THE AID OF WHICH THEY WERE SWUNG UP BY WORKMEN AND EMPTIED INTO THE CANALS
SHOWS SIGNS OF RISING A FORTNIGHT LATER THAN THE TIGRIS AND IS IN FLOOD FOR A MORE EXTENDED PERIOD IT DOES NOT SHRINK TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL UNTIL EARLY IN SEPTEMBER BY CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF THESE MIGHTY RIVERS PREVENTING DISASTROUS FLOODS
AT THE SACRED CITY THE FIRST MAN WAS CREATED THERE THE SOULS OF THE DEAD PASSED TOWARDS THE GREAT DEEP ITS PROXIMITY TO THE SEA
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DEITIES WAS DUE TO THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT TO WHICH THEY WERE SUBJECTED IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS
ONE WHICH IS CALLED SHATT EN NIL TO THE NORTH AND SHATT EL KAR TO THE SOUTH CURVED EASTWARD FROM BABYLON
THE DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD TO BASRA IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES AND THE AREA TRAVERSED BY THE SHATT EL ARAB IS SLOWLY EXTENDING AT THE RATE OF A MILE EVERY THIRTY YEARS OR SO AS A RESULT OF THE STEADY ACCUMULATION OF SILT AND MUD CARRIED DOWN BY THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES
AND EXPORT IT FOR COATING BOATS AND ROOFS
ANOTHER BABYLONIAN DEITY NAMED DAGAN
DAGDA THE IRISH CORN GOD
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS TOILSOME MODE OF IRRIGATION WAS SUBSTITUTED IN FAVOURABLE PARTS BY THE PRIMITIVE WATER WHEELS WHICH ARE USED IN OUR OWN DAY BY THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY WHO CULTIVATE STRIPS OF LAND ALONG THE RIVER BANKS
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CANAL THE SHATT EL HAI CROSSED THE PLAIN FROM THE TIGRIS TO ITS SISTER RIVER WHICH LIES LOWER AT THIS POINT AND DOES NOT RUN SO FAST WHERE THE ARTIFICIAL CANALS WERE CONSTRUCTED ON HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE STREAMS WHICH FED THEM
TO CONCILIATE AND SECURE THE CONTINUED ALLEGIANCE OF THE TILLERS OF THE SOIL LAW AND RELIGION BEING CLOSELY ASSOCIATED THEY HAD TO ADAPT THEIR GODS TO SUIT THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS
DERIVE HIS NAME FROM THE SEMITIC DAG A FISH AND SUGGEST THAT AFTER THE IDOL FELL ONLY THE FISHY PART DAGO WAS LEFT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS ARGUED THAT DAGON WAS A CORN GOD
WE SHALL FIND THESE ELDER DEMONS FIGURING IN THE BABYLONIAN CREATION MYTH WHICH RECEIVES TREATMENT IN A LATER CHAPTER THE ANCIENT SUMERIAN CITY OF ERIDU WHICH MEANS ON THE SEASHORE WAS INVESTED WITH GREAT SANCTITY FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
AND SIMILARLY SHOWED A TENDENCY TO ABSORB THE ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR RIVALS THE CHIEF DEITY OF A STATE WAS THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN A PANTHEON WHICH HAD ITS POLITICAL ASPECT AND INFLUENCED THE GROWTH OF LOCAL THEOLOGY
WAS IDENTIFIED WITH YA YA'U
BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE ART OF TRAINING HORSES IN HIS TRAIN WERE THE TRITONS HALF MEN HALF FISHES AND THE WATER FAIRIES THE NEREIDS BULLS BOARS AND RAMS WERE OFFERED TO THIS SEA GOD OF FERTILITY
EXALT THY HEAD MERODACH WAS THEIR SON IN TIME HE BECAME THE BEL OR LORD OF THE BABYLONIAN PANTHEON
HE WAS A NATIONAL RATHER THAN A CITY GOD
SUMERIA HAD MANY SURPLUS PRODUCTS INCLUDING CORN AND FIGS POTTERY FINE WOOL AND WOVEN GARMENTS
WHILE THE AIR WAS EVER WONDERFULLY TRANSPARENT UNDER CLOUDLESS SKIES OF VIVID BLUE THE NIGHTS WERE COOL AND OF GREAT BEAUTY WHETHER IN BRILLIANT MOONLIGHT OR WHEN PONDS AND CANALS WERE JEWELLED BY THE LUSTROUS DISPLAYS OF CLEAR AND NUMEROUS STARS WHICH GLORIFIED THAT HOMELAND OF THE EARLIEST ASTRONOMERS
THE SOUL OF THE LAND WAS IDENTIFIED WITH A MIGRATING FISH THE GROWTH OF THE FISH SUGGESTS THE GROWTH OF THE RIVER RISING IN FLOOD IN CELTIC FOLK TALES HIGH TIDES AND VALLEY FLOODS
WHO WAS ALSO CALLED NIN KI LADY OF THE EARTH MAY EA MAKE THEE GLAD CHANTED THE PRIESTS MAY DAMKINA QUEEN OF THE DEEP ILLUMINE THEE WITH HER COUNTENANCE
FOR THE DEITIES WERE NOT SHARPLY DEFINED AND EXISTED IN GROUPS ENNEADS WERE FORMED IN EGYPT BY PLACING A LOCAL GOD AT THE HEAD OF A GROUP OF EIGHT ELDER DEITIES THE SUN GOD RA WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE OF THE EARLIEST PANTHEON OF THIS CHARACTER AT HELIOPOLIS
HE WEPT FERTILIZING TEARS AND CORN WAS SOWN AND REAPED AMIDST LAMENTATIONS HE MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH REMI WHO WAS A PHASE OF SEBEK THE CROCODILE GOD A DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE OF NU
A NETWORK OF CANALS WAS CONSTRUCTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHICH RESTRICTED THE DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES AND DEVELOPED TO A HIGH DEGREE THEIR POTENTIALITIES AS FERTILIZING AGENCIES THE GREATEST OF THESE CANALS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANCIENTLY RIVER BEDS
A FORM OF PTAH OSIRIS AND RA AND AS A GOD OF FERTILITY HE IS SYMBOLIZED BY THE RAM ANOTHER EGYPTIAN FISH DEITY WAS THE GOD REM WHOSE NAME SIGNIFIES TO WEEP
OCCASIONAL SANDSTORMS DARKEN THE HEAVENS SWEEPING OVER STERILE WASTES AND PILING UP THE SHAPELESS MOUNDS WHICH MARK THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES MEANWHILE THE RIVERS ARE INCREASING IN VOLUME BEING FED BY THE MELTING SNOWS AT THEIR MOUNTAIN SOURCES FAR TO THE NORTH
THE VAGUE PRIMITIVE EGYPTIAN DEITY WHO SYMBOLIZED THE PRIMORDIAL DEEP THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A FISH GOD AND A CORN GOD IS NOT NECESSARILY REMOTE WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IN BABYLONIA AND EGYPT THE HARVEST WAS THE GIFT OF THE RIVERS
IN BABYLONIA THERE ARE TWO SEASONS THE RAINY AND THE DRY RAIN FALLS FROM NOVEMBER TILL MARCH AND THE PLAIN IS CARPETED IN SPRING BY PATCHES OF VIVID GREEN VERDURE AND BRILLIANT WILD FLOWERS
NATURE CONFERRED UPON THEM BOUNTIFUL REWARDS FOR THEIR LABOUR TRADE AND INDUSTRIES FLOURISHED AND THE CITIES INCREASED IN SPLENDOUR AND STRENGTH THEN AS NOW THE HEAT WAS GREAT DURING THE LONG SUMMER BUT REMARKABLY DRY AND UNVARYING
THE HEAD CONVERGES TO A POINT ABOVE BASRA WHERE THE RIVERS MEET AND FORM THE SHATT EL ARAB WHICH POURS INTO THE PERSIAN GULF AFTER MEETING THE KARUN AND DRAWING AWAY THE MAIN VOLUME OF THAT DOUBLE MOUTHED RIVER
IN ITS TEMPLE TOWER BUILT OF BRICK WAS A MARBLE STAIRWAY AND EVIDENCES HAVE BEEN FORTHCOMING THAT IN THE LATER SUMERIAN PERIOD THE STRUCTURE WAS LAVISHLY ADORNED
SUGGESTS THAT DAGON WAS THE FERTILIZING HARVEST GOD AMONG OTHER THINGS WHOSE USEFULNESS HAD BEEN IMPAIRED AS THEY BELIEVED
IT MUST THEREFORE HAVE HAD A BRISK AND FLOURISHING FOREIGN TRADE AT AN EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE PERIOD NO DOUBT NUMEROUS ALIEN MERCHANTS WERE ATTRACTED TO ITS CITIES
IN THE DAYS OF HEZEKIAH AND ISAIAH WHEN IT HAD COME UNDER THE SWAY OF THE YOUNGER CIVILIZATION OF ASSYRIA ON THE NORTH IT WAS A LAND OF CORN AND WINE A LAND OF BREAD AND VINEYARDS
FROM ONE WRITES A TRAVELLER FLOWS HOT WATER BLACK WITH BITUMEN WHILE THE OTHER DISCHARGES INTERMITTENTLY BITUMEN OR AFTER A RAINSTORM BITUMEN AND COLD WATER
CITIES HOWEVER DID NOT AS A RULE BEAR THE NAMES OF DEITIES WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SEVERAL WERE FOUNDED WHEN SUMERIAN RELIGION WAS IN ITS EARLY ANIMISTIC STAGES AND GODS AND GODDESSES WERE NOT SHARPLY DEFINED FROM THE VARIOUS SPIRIT GROUPS
WHICH APPROACHES NEARER TO THE WEST SEMITIC FORM DAGON OF THE PHILISTINES
THE GODS OF THE OLDEST COMPANY IN EGYPT WERE THE WRITER BELIEVES INVENTED BY PEOPLE IN WHOSE HOUSEHOLDS WOMEN HELD A HIGH POSITION
WAS A SEAPORT AT THE HEAD OF THE PERSIAN GULF A DAY'S JOURNEY SEPARATED THE RIVER MOUTHS WHEN ALEXANDER THE GREAT BROKE THE POWER OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE IN THE DAYS OF BABYLONIA'S PROSPERITY THE EUPHRATES WAS HAILED AS THE SOUL OF THE LAND AND THE TIGRIS AS
WHEN SUMERIA WAS BEGINNING TO FLOURISH THESE TWO RIVERS HAD SEPARATE OUTLETS AND ERIDU
RECEIVED OBLATIONS FROM THOSE WHO DEPENDED FOR THEIR AGRICULTURAL PROSPERITY ON HIS GIFTS OF FERTILIZING SEAWEED HE IS REFERRED TO IN MARTIN'S WESTERN ISLES AND IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THE EDDIC SEA GOD NJORD OF NOATUN
EXCEPT ERIDU WHERE ANCIENT WORKERS QUARRIED SANDSTONE FROM ITS SEA SHAPED RIDGE ALL THE CITIES WERE BUILT OF BRICK AN EXCELLENT CLAY BEING FOUND IN ABUNDANCE WHEN BRICK WALLS WERE CEMENTED WITH BITUMEN THEY WERE GIVEN GREAT STABILITY
OF AN EARLY GOD WITH WHOM SHE WAS EQUAL IN POWER AND DIGNITY IN THE LATER SYSTEMATIZED THEOLOGY OF THE BABYLONIANS WE SEEM TO TRACE THE FRAGMENTS OF A PRIMITIVE MYTHOLOGY WHICH WAS VAGUE IN OUTLINE
WHO WAS SUPREME AT THE ANCIENT SEA DESERTED PORT OF ERIDU
AND THE THEORY OBTAINED FOR A TIME
GOD OF THE SAILOR MAY HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND OTHER EARLY CIVILIZATIONS LIKE THE EARLY EGYPTIANS
STONE SUITABLE FOR BUILDING WAS VERY SCARCE AND LIMESTONE ALABASTER MARBLE AND BASALT HAD TO BE TAKEN FROM NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA WHERE THE MOUNTAINS ALSO YIELD COPPER AND LEAD AND IRON
AND STORING AND DISTRIBUTING SURPLUS WATER THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS DEVELOPED TO THE FULL THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THEIR COUNTRY AND MADE IT WHAT IT MAY ONCE AGAIN BECOME ONE OF THE FAIREST AND MOST HABITABLE AREAS IN THE WORLD
THE REFERENCE HOWEVER ACCORDING TO JASTROW IS NOT TO THE SALT OCEAN BUT THE SWEET WATERS FLOWING UNDER THE EARTH WHICH FEED THE STREAMS
THE BLADES OF THE WHEAT AND BARLEY THERE GROW TO BE FULL FOUR FINGERS BROAD AND FROM MILLET AND SESAME SEED HOW LARGE A TREE GROWS I KNOW MYSELF BUT SHALL NOT RECORD BEING WELL AWARE THAT EVEN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID RELATING TO THE CROPS PRODUCED
CREATED HIS DWELLING THOU JUDGEST THE CAUSE OF MANKIND O RIVER THOU ART MIGHTY O RIVER THOU ART SUPREME
THE INDIAN VARUNA WAS SIMILARLY A SKY AS WELL AS AN OCEAN GOD BEFORE THE THEORIZING AND SYSTEMATIZING BRAHMANIC TEACHERS RELEGATED HIM TO A PERMANENT ABODE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
A CREATURE ENDOWED WITH REASON WITH A BODY LIKE THAT OF A FISH WITH FEET BELOW LIKE THOSE OF A MAN WITH A FISH'S TAIL THIS DESCRIPTION RECALLS THE FAMILIAR FIGURES OF EGYPTIAN GODS AND PRIESTS ATTIRED IN THE SKINS OF THE SACRED ANIMALS
A DEITY OF PASTORAL NOMADS HAD TO RECEIVE ATTRIBUTES WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM AN AGRICULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE ONE OF RURAL CHARACTER HAD TO BE CHANGED TO RESPOND TO THE VARIOUS CALLS OF CITY LIFE
WHICH SOME REGARD AS THE CRADLE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE
HE REWARDED MANKIND FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDERED TO HIM HE WAS THEIR LEADER AND INSTRUCTOR HE ACHIEVED FOR THEM THE VICTORIES OVER THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF NATURE IN BRIEF HE WAS THE DRAGON SLAYER A DISTINCTION BY THE WAY WHICH WAS ATTACHED IN LATER TIMES TO HIS SON MERODACH
THE JAH OF THE HEBREWS IN YA DAGANU
IF ERIDU WAS NOT THE CRADLE OF THE SUMERIAN RACE IT WAS POSSIBLY THE CRADLE OF SUMERIAN CIVILIZATION
BABYLONIA IS A TREELESS COUNTRY AND TIMBER HAD TO BE IMPORTED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES THE DATE PALM WAS PROBABLY INTRODUCED BY MAN AS WERE CERTAINLY THE VINE AND THE FIG TREE WHICH WERE WIDELY CULTIVATED ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH
KING OF THE RIVER AS RAIN FELL FROM THE WATERS ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT THE GOD OF WATERS WAS ALSO A SKY AND EARTH GOD
HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE HOW TO FORM AND USE ALPHABETIC SIGNS AND INSTRUCTED THEM IN MATHEMATICS HE GAVE THEM THEIR CODE OF LAWS LIKE THE EGYPTIAN ARTISAN GOD PTAH
EKE OUT PRECARIOUS LIVINGS UNDER THE OPPRESSION OF TURKISH TAX GATHERERS WHO ARE SCARCELY LESS CONSIDERATE THAN THE PLUNDERING NOMADS OF THE DESERT THIS HISTORIC COUNTRY IS BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY PERSIA AND ON THE WEST BY THE ARABIAN DESERT
THE GODDESS OF THE RIVER BOYNE OSIRIS AND ISIS OF EGYPT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NILE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE WATER SUPPLY WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO ESCAPE THE EARLY SYMBOLISTS AND MANY OTHER PROOFS OF THIS THAN THOSE REFERRED TO COULD BE GIVEN
EACH CITY WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A DEITY WHO WAS THE NOMINAL OWNER OF THE SURROUNDING ARABLE LAND FARMS WERE RENTED OR PURCHASED FROM THE PRIESTHOOD AND PASTURE WAS HELD IN COMMON AS IN EGYPT WHERE WE FIND FOR INSTANCE THE ARTISAN GOD PTAH
BY SAYING THAT THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITY WAS BORN FROM THE WATER AS APHRODITE SPRANG FROM SEA FOAM OR AS ATARGATIS IN ANOTHER FORM OF THE EUPHRATES LEGEND
THAT THE PEASANT CLASS WAS GREATLY AFFECTED BY PERIODIC REVOLUTIONS OF THIS KIND WHICH BROUGHT LITTLE MORE TO THEM THAN A CHANGE OF RULERS THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY NECESSITATED THE CONTINUANCE OF AGRICULTURAL METHODS AND THE RIGID OBSERVANCE OF EXISTING LAND LAWS
PLUNGED INTO THE WATERS IN THE FIRST CASE THE EUPHRATES IN THE SECOND THE SACRED POOL AT THE TEMPLE NEAR THE TOWN AND WERE CHANGED INTO FISHES THE IDEA IS THAT WHERE A GOD DIES THAT IS CEASES TO EXIST IN HUMAN FORM
WHO WAS EITHER IMPORTED FROM BABYLONIA OR WAS A SEA GOD OF MORE THAN ONE BRANCH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE THE AUTHORITIES ARE AT VARIANCE REGARDING THE FORM AND ATTRIBUTES OF DAGAN OUR KNOWLEDGE REGARDING HIM IS DERIVED MAINLY FROM THE BIBLE
IN A FRAGMENTARY BABYLONIAN CHARM THERE IS A REFERENCE TO A SACRED TREE OR BUSH AT ERIDU
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS DEVELOPED AS AN ATMOSPHERIC GOD WITH SOLAR AND LUNAR ATTRIBUTES THE SEVEN DEMONS WHO WERE HIS MESSENGERS RECALL THE STORMY MARUTS THE FOLLOWERS OF INDRA THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS
NU WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE PRIMORDIAL DEEP AND NUT OF THE WATERS ABOVE THE HEAVENS THE MOTHER OF MOON AND SUN AND THE STARS THE OTHERS WERE PHASES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS AND THE FORCES OF NATURE IN ACTIVITY AND REPOSE
THEN THE PERIOD OF DROUGHT ENSUES THE SUN RAPIDLY BURNS UP ALL VEGETATION AND EVERYWHERE THE EYE IS WEARIED BY LONG STRETCHES OF BROWN AND YELLOW DESERT
THERE ARE ALSO REFERENCES TO SEA MAIDENS THE BABYLONIAN MERMAIDS OR NEREIDS WE HAVE A GLIMPSE OF SEA GIANTS WHICH RESEMBLE THE INDIAN DANAVAS AND DAITYAS OF OCEAN IN THE CHANT
THE INDIAN CREATIVE GODS BRAHMA AND VISHNU HAD FISH FORMS IN SANSKRIT LITERATURE MANU THE EPONYMOUS FIRST MAN IS INSTRUCTED BY THE FISH
RATHER THAN DAGON WITH JAH
WHEN THE CAPTURED ARK OF THE ISRAELITES WAS PLACED IN IT THE IMAGE OF DAGON FELL ON HIS FACE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE HEAD OF DAGON AND BOTH THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS WERE CUT OFF UPON THE THRESHOLD
TWO NAMES WHICH HAVE EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING ETYMOLOGICALLY CONNECTED JAH'S NAME IS ONE OF THE WORDS FOR GOD
LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH SA KALAMA RULER OF THE LAND AS WELL AS ENGUR GOD OF THE ABYSS NAQBU THE DEEP
THE PRIESTLY MAGICIANS OF HISTORIC BABYLONIA
IT MAY BE OF COURSE THAT BAAL DAGON REPRESENTS A FUSION OF DEITIES
HIS LIFE PASSES INTO THE WATERS WHERE HE IS BURIED AND THIS AGAIN IS MERELY A THEORY TO BRING THE DIVINE WATER OR THE DIVINE FISH INTO HARMONY WITH ANTHROPOMORPHIC IDEAS THE SAME THING WAS SOMETIMES EFFECTED IN ANOTHER WAY
AND THE THIRD ANSHAR AND KISHAR
IN EACH DISTRICT THE CHARACTER OF THE DEITY WAS SHAPED TO ACCORD WITH LOCAL CONDITIONS
ARE IN SUMMER PARTLY BARREN WASTES AND PARTLY JUNGLE AND REEDY SWAMP BEDOUINS CAMP BESIDE SANDY HEAPS WHICH WERE ONCE POPULOUS AND THRIVING CITIES AND HERE AND THERE THE SHRUNKEN REMNANTS OF A PEOPLE ONCE GREAT AND INFLUENTIAL
TO WORK METALS TO MAKE POTTERY AND BRICKS AND TO BUILD TEMPLES HE WAS THE ARTISAN GOD NUN URA GOD OF THE POTTER KUSKI BANDA
THIS CHANGE FROM ARTISAN GOD TO CREATOR NUDIMMUD MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE TENDENCY OF EARLY RELIGIOUS CULTS TO ATTACH TO THEIR CHIEF GOD THE ATTRIBUTES OF RIVALS EXALTED AT OTHER CENTRES
FROM WHOM THEIR POWERS WERE DERIVED AND THE FAIRY LORE ABOUT SWAN MAIDS AND MEN AND THE SEALS AND OTHER ANIMALS WHO COULD DIVEST THEMSELVES OF THEIR SKIN COVERINGS AND APPEAR IN HUMAN SHAPE
HIS NAME SIGNIFYING THE HIGH ONE IS DERIVED FROM ANA HEAVEN HE WAS THE CITY GOD OF ERECH
OR RIMMAN WHO LINKS WITH THE HITTITE TARKU ALL THESE ARE DEITIES OF TEMPEST AND THE MOUNTAINS WILD HUNTSMEN IN THE RAGING HOST
THIS TERRITORY HE WROTE IS OF ALL THAT WE KNOW THE BEST BY FAR FOR PRODUCING GRAIN IT IS SO GOOD THAT IT RETURNS AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDREDFOLD FOR THE AVERAGE AND WHEN IT BEARS AT ITS BEST IT PRODUCES THREE HUNDREDFOLD
THIS CLASSIFICATION SUGGESTS THAT NIPPUR HAD EITHER RISEN IN POLITICAL IMPORTANCE AND DOMINATED THE CITIES OF ERECH AND ERIDU OR THAT ITS PRIESTS WERE INFLUENTIAL AT THE COURT OF A RULER WHO WAS THE OVERLORD OF SEVERAL CITY STATES
AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
WHEN YOU ARE TOLD ANYTHING CANNOT BE DONE THERE IS AN END OF IT IT IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AT PARIS WHEN ANYTHING CANNOT BE DONE YOU PAY DOUBLE AND IT IS DONE DIRECTLY THAT IS WHAT ALL THE FRENCH SAY RETURNED SIGNOR PASTRINI SOMEWHAT PIQUED
I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
AND WE SHALL HAVE COMPLETE SUCCESS DO YOUR EXCELLENCIES STILL WISH FOR A CARRIAGE FROM NOW TO SUNDAY MORNING PARBLEU SAID ALBERT
THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
WAS THE PALACE THE GENIUS FOR LAUDATION CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RACE WAS IN THAT PHRASE FRANZ AND ALBERT DESCENDED THE CARRIAGE APPROACHED THE PALACE THEIR EXCELLENCIES STRETCHED THEIR LEGS ALONG THE SEATS
SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
BEARING THE NAME OF ITS MAKER OF PARISIAN MANUFACTURE AND A COUNT'S CORONET HERE IT IS SAID HE PESTE RETURNED ALBERT I COMPLIMENT YOU ON IT I HAVE ITS FELLOW HE TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
THE TEMPLE OF ANTONINUS AND FAUSTINA AND THE VIA SACRA THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER SIGNOR PASTRINI HAD PROMISED THEM A BANQUET HE GAVE THEM A TOLERABLE REPAST AT THE END OF THE DINNER HE ENTERED IN PERSON
THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
YOU HAD SOME MOTIVE FOR COMING HERE MAY I BEG TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS AH YES YOU HAVE ORDERED YOUR CARRIAGE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK PRECISELY I HAVE YOU INTEND VISITING IL COLOSSEO YOU MEAN THE COLOSSEUM IT IS THE SAME THING
HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
IN AN HOUR IN AN HOUR IT WILL BE AT THE DOOR AN HOUR AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS AT THE DOOR IT WAS A HACK CONVEYANCE WHICH WAS ELEVATED TO THE RANK OF A PRIVATE CARRIAGE IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION BUT IN SPITE OF ITS HUMBLE EXTERIOR
AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
FOR AT TERRACINA I WAS PLUNDERED EVEN OF MY HUNTING KNIFE
ALBERT POURED HIMSELF OUT A GLASS OF LACRYMA CHRISTI WHICH HE SIPPED AT INTERVALS MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS WELL SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ NOW THAT MY COMPANION IS QUIETED AND YOU HAVE SEEN HOW PEACEFUL MY INTENTIONS ARE
ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
IN THE HOPE OF MAKING MORE OUT OF ME HE WILL TAKE A LESS PRICE THAN THE ONE I OFFER YOU YOU WILL LOSE THE PREFERENCE AND THAT WILL BE YOUR FAULT DO NOT GIVE YOURSELVES THE TROUBLE EXCELLENCY
AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
FOR THAT REASON I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY TRAVEL BUT SAID ALBERT EMITTING A VOLUME OF SMOKE AND BALANCING HIS CHAIR ON ITS HIND LEGS ONLY MADMEN
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LEFT ON THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE DORIA PALACE AND THAT HAS BEEN LET TO A RUSSIAN PRINCE FOR TWENTY SEQUINS A DAY THE TWO YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH AN AIR OF STUPEFACTION WELL
CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
THAT AS I HAVE BEEN FOUR TIMES BEFORE AT ROME I KNOW THE PRICES OF ALL THE CARRIAGES WE WILL GIVE YOU TWELVE PIASTRES FOR TO DAY TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER AND THEN YOU WILL MAKE A GOOD PROFIT
AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
BUT AT THE FIRST WORDS HE WAS INTERRUPTED EXCELLENCY SAID PASTRINI I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOUR APPROBATION BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THAT I CAME
IT IS TO PASS THE CARNIVAL AT VENICE THERE WE ARE SURE OF OBTAINING GONDOLAS IF WE CANNOT HAVE CARRIAGES AH THE DEVIL NO CRIED ALBERT I CAME TO ROME TO SEE THE CARNIVAL AND I WILL THOUGH I SEE IT ON STILTS
YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
TELL ME WHO IS THIS LUIGI VAMPA IS HE A SHEPHERD OR A NOBLEMAN YOUNG OR OLD TALL OR SHORT DESCRIBE HIM IN ORDER THAT IF WE MEET HIM BY CHANCE LIKE BUGABOO JOHN OR LARA WE MAY RECOGNIZE HIM
CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
BRAVO AN EXCELLENT IDEA WE WILL DISGUISE OURSELVES AS MONSTER PULCHINELLOS
THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
SHALL I BRING THE CARRIAGE NEARER TO THE PALACE ACCUSTOMED AS FRANZ WAS TO THE ITALIAN PHRASEOLOGY HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO LOOK ROUND HIM BUT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO HIM FRANZ WAS THE EXCELLENCY
THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
LUIGI VAMPA COMES TO TAKE US AND WE TAKE HIM WE BRING HIM BACK TO ROME AND PRESENT HIM TO HIS HOLINESS THE POPE WHO ASKS HOW HE CAN REPAY SO GREAT A SERVICE THEN WE MERELY ASK FOR A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES AND WE SEE THE CARNIVAL IN THE CARRIAGE
AND DOUBTLESS THE ROMAN PEOPLE WILL CROWN US AT THE CAPITOL AND PROCLAIM US LIKE CURTIUS AND THE VEILED HORATIUS THE PRESERVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY
HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
HE WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER AND HE RETURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS THE OLD MAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE FELT THAT SOME GREAT AND UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNE HUNG OVER HIS HEAD AT LENGTH HE ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THE MEANING OF WHICH HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
ONCE UPON A TIME WELL GO ON SIGNOR PASTRINI TURNED TOWARD FRANZ WHO SEEMED TO HIM THE MORE REASONABLE OF THE TWO WE MUST DO HIM JUSTICE HE HAD HAD A GREAT MANY FRENCHMEN IN HIS HOUSE BUT HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO COMPREHEND THEM
ON YOUR HONOR IS THAT TRUE CRIED ALBERT COUNT RETURNED SIGNOR PASTRINI HURT AT ALBERT'S REPEATED DOUBTS OF THE TRUTH OF HIS ASSERTIONS I DO NOT SAY THIS TO YOU BUT TO YOUR COMPANION WHO KNOWS ROME
YOUR ANSWER IS SUBLIME AND WORTHY THE LET HIM DIE OF CORNEILLE ONLY WHEN HORACE MADE THAT ANSWER THE SAFETY OF ROME WAS CONCERNED
AND LEVEL THEIR PIECES AT YOU EH PARBLEU THEY SHOULD KILL ME THE INN KEEPER TURNED TO FRANZ WITH AN AIR THAT SEEMED TO SAY YOUR FRIEND IS DECIDEDLY MAD MY DEAR ALBERT RETURNED FRANZ
BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
SUDDENLY THE DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FADE AWAY FRANZ TOOK OUT HIS WATCH IT WAS HALF PAST FOUR THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT THE DOOR FRANZ ORDERED THE COACHMAN TO BE READY AT EIGHT HE WISHED TO SHOW ALBERT THE COLOSSEUM BY MOONLIGHT
TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
WELL WHAT HAS THIS BANDIT TO DO WITH THE ORDER I HAVE GIVEN THE COACHMAN TO LEAVE THE CITY BY THE PORTA DEL POPOLO
AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
BUT EXCELLENCY SAID PASTRINI STILL STRIVING TO GAIN HIS POINT NOW GO RETURNED FRANZ OR I SHALL GO MYSELF AND BARGAIN WITH YOUR AFFETTATORE WHO IS MINE ALSO HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS PLUNDERED ME PRETTY WELL ALREADY AND
RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
WHICH WILL MAKE IT STILL MORE DIFFICULT MY FRIEND SAID MORCERF LET US ENJOY THE PRESENT WITHOUT GLOOMY FOREBODINGS FOR THE FUTURE AT LEAST WE CAN HAVE A WINDOW WHERE IN THE CORSO AH A WINDOW EXCLAIMED SIGNOR PASTRINI
THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
AS HE HAD SHOWN HIM SAINT PETER'S BY DAYLIGHT WHEN WE SHOW A FRIEND A CITY ONE HAS ALREADY VISITED WE FEEL THE SAME PRIDE AS WHEN WE POINT OUT A WOMAN WHOSE LOVER WE HAVE BEEN
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID ALBERT ENTERING NO CARRIAGE TO BE HAD JUST SO RETURNED FRANZ YOU HAVE GUESSED IT WELL YOUR ETERNAL CITY IS A NICE SORT OF PLACE
DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
RETURNED SIGNOR PASTRINI WITH THE SMILE PECULIAR TO THE ITALIAN SPECULATOR WHEN HE CONFESSES DEFEAT I WILL DO ALL I CAN AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
WHAT DO YOU NOT KNOW HIM I HAVE NOT THAT HONOR YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD HIS NAME NEVER WELL THEN HE IS A BANDIT COMPARED TO WHOM THE DECESARIS AND THE GASPARONES WERE MERE CHILDREN
BUT THAT HE WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US BUT I WILL BELIEVE ALL YOU SAY SO PROCEED BUT IF YOUR EXCELLENCY DOUBT MY VERACITY SIGNOR PASTRINI RETURNED FRANZ
AID ME TO BURY MY CHILD CARLINI FETCHED TWO PICKAXES AND THE FATHER AND THE LOVER BEGAN TO DIG AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE OAK BENEATH WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL WAS TO REPOSE WHEN THE GRAVE WAS FORMED THE FATHER KISSED HER FIRST AND THEN THE LOVER
NOW THEN ALBERT CRIED FRANZ HERE IS A BANDIT FOR YOU AT LAST I FOREWARN YOU SIGNOR PASTRINI THAT I SHALL NOT BELIEVE ONE WORD OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US HAVING TOLD YOU THIS BEGIN
AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
WHERE DO YOUR EXCELLENCIES WISH TO GO ASKED HE TO SAINT PETER'S FIRST AND THEN TO THE COLOSSEUM RETURNED ALBERT BUT ALBERT DID NOT KNOW THAT IT TAKES A DAY TO SEE SAINT PETER'S AND A MONTH TO STUDY IT THE DAY WAS PASSED AT SAINT PETER'S ALONE
AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
YOU ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN CASSANDRA WHO WAS A PROPHETESS AND YET NO ONE BELIEVED HER WHILE YOU AT LEAST ARE SURE OF THE CREDENCE OF HALF YOUR AUDIENCE COME SIT DOWN AND TELL US ALL ABOUT THIS SIGNOR VAMPA
A YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEON
AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
SIGNOR PASTRINI REMAINED SILENT A SHORT TIME IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS MUSING OVER THIS ANSWER WHICH DID NOT SEEM VERY CLEAR BUT SAID FRANZ IN HIS TURN INTERRUPTING HIS HOST'S MEDITATIONS
AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
EXCELLENCY SAID HE GRAVELY ADDRESSING FRANZ IF YOU LOOK UPON ME AS A LIAR IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING IT WAS FOR YOUR INTEREST ALBERT DOES NOT SAY YOU ARE A LIAR SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ
HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
BUT FROM NOW TILL SUNDAY YOU CAN HAVE FIFTY IF YOU PLEASE AH THAT IS SOMETHING SAID ALBERT TO DAY IS THURSDAY AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY ARRIVE BETWEEN THIS AND SUNDAY TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND TRAVELLERS WILL ARRIVE REPLIED FRANZ
AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
THAT IS ACTING LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND THEY ALL FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE
SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
THIS REPLIED SIGNOR PASTRINI THAT YOU WILL GO OUT BY ONE BUT I VERY MUCH DOUBT YOUR RETURNING BY THE OTHER WHY ASKED FRANZ BECAUSE AFTER NIGHTFALL YOU ARE NOT SAFE FIFTY YARDS FROM THE GATES
DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK CUCUMETTO AROUSED HIS MEN AND GAVE THE WORD TO MARCH BUT CARLINI WOULD NOT QUIT THE FOREST WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD BECOME OF RITA'S FATHER HE WENT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
THE YOUNG MEN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEMSELVES HAPPY TO HAVE SECURED IT FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS OF THE CARNIVAL EXCELLENCY CRIED THE CICERONE SEEING FRANZ APPROACH THE WINDOW
SIGNOR PASTRINI'S FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE AND PRAY ASKED FRANZ WHERE ARE THESE PISTOLS BLUNDERBUSSES AND OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS WITH WHICH YOU INTEND FILLING THE CARRIAGE NOT OUT OF MY ARMORY
THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
AND KNOWS TOO THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT TO BE LAUGHED AT MY DEAR FELLOW SAID ALBERT TURNING TO FRANZ HERE IS AN ADMIRABLE ADVENTURE WE WILL FILL OUR CARRIAGE WITH PISTOLS BLUNDERBUSSES AND DOUBLE BARRELLED GUNS
I HASTEN TO COMPLY WITH YOUR EXCELLENCIES WISHES ONLY I TELL YOU BEFOREHAND THE CARRIAGE WILL COST YOU SIX PIASTRES A DAY AND AS I AM NOT A MILLIONAIRE LIKE THE GENTLEMAN IN THE NEXT APARTMENTS SAID FRANZ I WARN YOU
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE ROMAN BANDITS
OR BLOCKHEADS LIKE US EVER DO TRAVEL MEN IN THEIR SENSES DO NOT QUIT THEIR HOTEL IN THE RUE DU HELDER THEIR WALK ON THE BOULEVARD DE GAND AND THE CAFE DE PARIS IT
KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF TORMENT SUBTILE AND GROSS FOR EXAMPLE IGNORANCE ITSELF IS A TORMENT BUT IT IS A SUBTILE TORMENT
DEATH IS THE WANT OF LIFE AND WEAKNESS IS THE WANT OF STRENGTH NEVERTHELESS A DOUBT OCCURS TO THE MIND THAT IS SCORPIONS AND SERPENTS ARE POISONOUS
BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT TO PUNISH THE CRIMINAL AND THIS PUNISHMENT IS INTENDED TO WARN AND TO PREVENT SO THAT NO OTHER PERSON WILL DARE TO COMMIT A LIKE CRIME
WILL THIS BE A BALM FOR HIS WOUND OR A REMEDY FOR HIS PAIN NO GOD FORBID IN TRUTH THE TWO ACTIONS ARE THE SAME BOTH ARE INJURIES
IF AT THIS MOMENT A WILD ARAB WERE TO ENTER THIS PLACE WITH A DRAWN SWORD WISHING TO ASSAULT WOUND AND KILL YOU MOST ASSUREDLY I WOULD PREVENT HIM
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE OCCURRED FIRST
BUT ACT ACCORDING TO THE DESIRES OF NATURE THAT IS IF THEY TORMENT THOSE WHO TORMENT THEM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RELIGION THEY ARE EXCUSED BECAUSE THE DIVINE COMMAND HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED TO THEM
BUT AS THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR POISON DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR ELEMENTS THAT IS TO SAY AS THERE IS ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THEREFORE THIS ANTAGONISM IS EVIL
BECAUSE THROUGH VENGEANCE NO GOOD RESULT IS GAINED BY THE AVENGER SO IF A MAN STRIKES ANOTHER AND HE WHO IS STRUCK TAKES REVENGE BY RETURNING THE BLOW WHAT ADVANTAGE WILL HE GAIN
BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INFLICTING A PUNISHMENT BY WHICH THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PROTECTED IF THE COMMUNITY AND THE INHERITORS OF THE MURDERED ONE WERE TO FORGIVE AND RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL
THE NONEXISTENCE OF EVIL THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF THIS SUBJECT IS VERY DIFFICULT KNOW THAT BEINGS ARE OF TWO KINDS MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE HAD NOT WITHSTOOD THE NOTORIOUS ATTILA HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT A SINGLE LIVING MAN SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE BLOODTHIRSTY WOLVES
THIS CONDUCT IS WORTHY OF MAN FOR WHAT ADVANTAGE DOES HE GAIN BY VENGEANCE THE TWO ACTIONS ARE EQUIVALENT IF ONE ACTION IS REPREHENSIBLE BOTH ARE REPREHENSIBLE
IN ALL THESE CLASSES OF PERFECTIONS THERE WOULD BE PROGRESS AND THERE WOULD BE FEWER CRIMES IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES CRIME
STUPIDITY IS THE WANT OF GOOD SENSE ALL THESE THINGS HAVE NO REAL EXISTENCE IN THE SAME WAY THE SENSIBLE REALITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY GOOD
THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO PARTAKE OF MEAT AND BUTTER TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS TAREF AND TAREF IN HEBREW MEANS UNCLEAN AS KOSHER MEANS CLEAN THIS
WHEN A WORKMAN LABORS FROM MORNING UNTIL EVENING JUSTICE REQUIRES THAT HE SHALL BE PAID HIS WAGES BUT WHEN HE HAS DONE NO WORK AND TAKEN NO TROUBLE HE IS GIVEN A GIFT THIS
CONSIDER HOW OFTEN MURDER OCCURS AMONG THE BARBARIANS OF AFRICA THEY EVEN KILL ONE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO EAT EACH OTHER'S FLESH AND BLOOD
BUT CAN THERE BE AN IDEAL BARRISTER OTHER THAN A SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER THE EAGER YOUNG WRITER JUST BEGINNING A LITERARY CAREER MIGHT
FOR EXAMPLE MIND ITSELF IS AN INTELLECTUAL THING WHICH HAS NO OUTWARD EXISTENCE ALL MAN'S CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITIES FORM AN INTELLECTUAL EXISTENCE
THAT THE MORE EXPERT HE BECOMES AS AN ADVOCATE THE BETTER WILL HE BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS JUSTICE WHICH IS HIS IDEAL CAN HE TELL HIMSELF THIS
IN THE QUIET HOURS WHEN WE ARE ALONE WITH OURSELVES AND THERE IS NOBODY TO TELL US WHAT FINE FELLOWS WE ARE WE COME SOMETIMES UPON A WEAK MOMENT IN WHICH WE WONDER
THE INJURED ONE SHOULD FORGIVE HIM BUT THE COMMUNITIES MUST PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF MAN SO IF SOMEONE ASSAULTS INJURES OPPRESSES AND WOUNDS ME
PART FIVE MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS
IT IS THAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE DAY AND NIGHT OCCUPIED IN MAKING PENAL LAWS AND IN PREPARING AND ORGANIZING INSTRUMENTS AND MEANS OF PUNISHMENT THEY BUILD PRISONS MAKE CHAINS AND FETTERS
IS GIVING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD EXPRESSING THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT FOR HIS OWN PROFIT PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR THAT ALONE
IF THEY SEE NO PUNISHMENT FORTHCOMING THEY WILL KILL MEN MERELY FOR PLEASURE AND DIVERSION ONE OF THE TYRANTS OF PERSIA KILLED HIS TUTOR MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING MERRY FOR MERE FUN AND SPORT
AND ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM ALL THEIR CRUELTIES AND OPPRESSIONS NO THE WORDS OF CHRIST REFER TO THE CONDUCT OF TWO INDIVIDUALS TOWARD EACH OTHER IF ONE PERSON ASSAULTS ANOTHER
CERTAINLY FOR AN INTELLIGENT MAN DEATH IS BETTER THAN SIN AND A CUT TONGUE IS BETTER THAN LYING OR CALUMNY THE OTHER KIND OF TORMENT IS GROSS SUCH AS PENALTIES
THEY SAY IS A QUESTION OF LAW AND NOT OF REASON BUT THE THEOLOGIANS THINK THAT THE GOOD AND EVIL OF THINGS DEPEND UPON BOTH REASON AND LAW
THAT BECAUSE THERE CAN BE NO STANDARD BY WHICH ITS DISCIPLES ARE JUDGED SAVE THE EARTHLY STANDARD THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE WITHIN ITS RANKS FOR THE ALTRUIST OR THE IDEALIST
BUT ONLY ABOUT HIS OWN VICTORY WHAT ULTIMATELY THEN IS HE AFTER WHAT DOES THE BAR OFFER ITS DEVOTEES BEYOND MATERIAL SUCCESS
INDIFFERENCE TO GOD IS ITSELF A TORMENT SO ALSO ARE FALSEHOOD CRUELTY AND TREACHERY ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS ARE TORMENTS BUT THEY ARE SUBTILE TORMENTS
THOSE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES AND THOSE INTELLECTUAL THINGS WHICH ARE SENSIBLE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE PERCEIVED BY THE FIVE EXTERIOR SENSES THUS
EVIL IS SIMPLY THEIR NONEXISTENCE SO IGNORANCE IS THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE ERROR IS THE WANT OF GUIDANCE FORGETFULNESS IS THE WANT OF MEMORY
THE COMMUNITY HAS NO HATRED NOR ANIMOSITY FOR THE MURDERER IT IMPRISONS OR PUNISHES HIM MERELY FOR THE PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF OTHERS IT IS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING VENGEANCE UPON THE MURDERER
IS BOUNTY IF YOU GIVE ALMS AND GIFTS TO A POOR MAN ALTHOUGH HE HAS TAKEN NO TROUBLE FOR YOU NOR DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT THIS IS BOUNTY
THAT ONE HARDLY DARES TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THE PROFESSION BESIDES ONE NEVER KNOWS WHEN ONE MAY NOT WANT TO BE DEFENDED HOWEVER I SHALL TAKE THE RISK AND PUT THE BARRISTER IN THE DOCK
BUT IN A PLACE WHERE THE COMMANDS OF A PROPHET ARE NOT KNOWN AND WHERE THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE DIVINE INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS THE COMMAND OF CHRIST TO RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL
NOW WHAT OF THE BAR IS THE BARRISTER AFTER ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT HE FOLLOWS WHAT GLEAM WHAT ARE HIS IDEALS
SO ALSO I AM ENTITLED TO MY OPINION ABOUT THE BAR WHICH IS THIS THAT BECAUSE IT OFFERS MATERIAL VICTORIES ONLY AND NEVER SPIRITUAL ONES
FOR IT IS REASON THAT FORMULATES THE REPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF THE ACTION WHEN A MAN COMMITS THIS BAD ACTION HE WILL SURELY BE RESPONSIBLE
IMPRISONMENT BEATING EXPULSION AND BANISHMENT BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD SEPARATION FROM GOD IS THE GREATEST TORMENT OF ALL
IS MERELY AN ATTORNEY WHILE A CIVIL SERVANT SLEEPS FROM TEN TO FOUR EVERY DAY AND IS ONLY WAKED UP AT SIXTY IN ORDER TO BE GIVEN A PENSION
A DOCTOR COLLECTS FEES FROM HIS PATIENTS BUT HE IS AIMING AT SOMETHING MORE THAN POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE HE IS OUT TO PUT AN END TO SUFFERING A SCHOOLMASTER
IS THAT THE PEOPLE MUST BE EDUCATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO CRIMES WILL BE COMMITTED FOR IT IS POSSIBLE TO EDUCATE THE MASSES SO EFFECTIVELY THAT THEY WILL AVOID AND SHRINK FROM PERPETRATING CRIMES
WE MUST SPEAK OF THINGS THAT ARE FEASIBLE FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE OPPRESSES INJURES AND WRONGS ANOTHER AND THE WRONGED MAN RETALIATES THIS IS VENGEANCE AND IS CENSURABLE
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNITIES DEPENDS UPON JUSTICE NOT UPON FORGIVENESS THEN WHAT CHRIST MEANT BY FORGIVENESS AND PARDON IS NOT THAT
AND EVIL IS DUE TO THEIR NONEXISTENCE THAT IS TO SAY BLINDNESS IS THE WANT OF SIGHT DEAFNESS IS THE WANT OF HEARING POVERTY IS THE WANT OF WEALTH ILLNESS IS THE WANT OF HEALTH
ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS OF LIVING HAVE SOMETHING OF NOBILITY IN THEM WE ENTER THEM FULL OF HIGH RESOLVES
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY OBSERVE THIS WELL DRESSED GENTLEMAN BEFORE YOU WHAT SHALL WE SAY ABOUT HIM LET US BEGIN BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT WE EXPECT
I DON'T KNOW WHY PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE WALKS ABOUT THE TEMPLE IN A TOP HAT SO MANY OF ONE'S ACQUAINTANCES AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HAVE EATEN DINNERS
ARRANGE PLACES OF EXILE AND BANISHMENT AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF HARDSHIPS AND TORTURES AND THINK BY THESE MEANS TO DISCIPLINE CRIMINALS WHEREAS IN REALITY THEY ARE CAUSING DESTRUCTION OF MORALS
BUT THERE IS NO HUMOROUS COMMENT TO BE MADE UPON THE BARRISTER UNLESS IT IS TO CALL HIM MY LEARNED FRIEND HE HAS MUCH MORE RIGHT THAN THE ACTOR TO CLAIM TO BE A MEMBER OF THE PROFESSION
NEVER MIND WHETHER HE FAILS MORE OFTEN OR LESS OFTEN THAN OTHERS TO ATTAIN THEM I AM NOT BOTHERING ABOUT THAT I ONLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER
FIX HIS EYES UPON FRANCIS THOMPSON RATHER THAN UPON SIR HALL CAINE THE EAGER YOUNG CLERGYMAN MIGHT DREAM DREAMS OVER THE LIFE OF FATHER DAMIEN MORE OFTEN THAN OVER THE LIFE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
BUT IN RELATION TO THEMSELVES THEY ARE NOT EVIL FOR THEIR POISON IS THEIR WEAPON AND BY THEIR STING THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES
NOT HOW MUCH MONEY WE ARE EARNING NOR HOW FAMOUS WE ARE BECOMING BUT WHAT GOOD WE ARE DOING IF A BARRISTER EVER HAS SUCH A MOMENT WHAT IS HIS CONSOLATION
WILL BE THE BETTER SERVED BY REASON OF IT LET US TAKE A CASE SMITH VERSUS JONES COUNSEL IS BRIEFED FOR SMITH AFTER EXAMINING THE CASE HE TELLS HIMSELF IN EFFECT THIS
THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD KNOW THAT TO DO JUSTICE IS TO GIVE TO EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS DESERTS FOR EXAMPLE
IS LESS FREQUENT THAN AMONG UNCIVILIZED THAT IS TO SAY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED THE TRUE CIVILIZATION WHICH IS DIVINE CIVILIZATION
IF I ABANDONED YOU TO THE ARAB THAT WOULD NOT BE JUSTICE BUT INJUSTICE BUT IF HE INJURE ME PERSONALLY I WOULD FORGIVE HIM ONE THING REMAINS TO BE SAID
HE CREATED GOOD THIS EVIL IS NOTHINGNESS SO DEATH IS THE ABSENCE OF LIFE WHEN MAN NO LONGER RECEIVES LIFE HE DIES DARKNESS
THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF RETRIBUTORY PUNISHMENTS ONE IS VENGEANCE THE OTHER CHASTISEMENT MAN HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE
ONE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A TITLED GENTLEMAN IN HARLEY STREET AN IDEAL SCHOOLMASTER IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH THE HEADMASTER OF ETON OR THE OWNER OF THE MOST PROFITABLE PREPARATORY SCHOOL
ARE THEY GOOD OR EVIL FOR THEY ARE EXISTING BEINGS YES A SCORPION IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN A SERPENT IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN
SO ALSO JUSTICE IS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE LORD THE TENT OF EXISTENCE IS UPHELD UPON THE PILLAR OF JUSTICE AND NOT UPON FORGIVENESS
FROM A PROFESSION IN THE FIRST PLACE CERTAINLY WE EXPECT A LIVING BUT I THINK WE WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
THE ABBASID HAVING SUMMONED HIS MINISTERS COUNCILLORS AND FUNCTIONARIES TO HIS PRESENCE LET LOOSE A BOX FULL OF SCORPIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY
THIS PUNISHMENT IS FOR THE PROTECTION OF MAN'S RIGHTS BUT IT IS NOT VENGEANCE VENGEANCE APPEASES THE ANGER OF THE HEART BY OPPOSING ONE EVIL TO ANOTHER THIS IS NOT ALLOWABLE
BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE THE PROFESSION IS AN IGNOBLE ONE WE HAD OUR CHANCES INDEED THE LIGHT IS STILL THERE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK IT BECKONS TO US
THE PROFESSION OF BARNET WALKING WOULD ONLY BE TOLERABLE IF HE COULD PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT BY HIS EXERTIONS HE WAS HELPING TO REVIVE THE NEGLECTED ART OF PEDESTRIANISM
THAT A PROFESSION IS A NOBLE OR AN IGNOBLE ONE ACCORDING AS IT OFFERS OR DENIES TO HIM WHO PRACTISES IT THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING FOR SOME OTHER END THAN HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT
BUT WE SHOULD HARDLY BE PROUD OF OUR NEW PROFESSION WE SHOULD PREFER TO EARN A THOUSAND A YEAR BY DOING SOME MORE USEFUL WORK INDEED TO A MAN OF ANY FINE FEELING
PLACES FOR IMPRISONMENT AND BANISHMENT AND THEY EXPECT CRIMES TO BE COMMITTED THIS HAS A DEMORALIZING EFFECT BUT IF THE COMMUNITY WOULD ENDEAVOR TO EDUCATE THE MASSES
ACCORDING TO REASON IS EVIL AND REPREHENSIBLE IF HE COMMITS A MURDER HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE WHETHER THE RENOWN OF THE PROPHET HAS REACHED HIM OR NOT
TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY IS REASON EVERY INTELLIGENT MAN COMPREHENDS THAT MURDER THEFT TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE CONTRARY PREVAILS THE COMMUNITY IS ALWAYS THINKING OF ENFORCING THE PENAL LAWS AND OF PREPARING MEANS OF PUNISHMENT INSTRUMENTS OF DEATH AND CHASTISEMENT
THE COMMUNITY HAS NO ILL WILL AND RANCOR IN THE INFLICTION OF PUNISHMENT AND IT DOES NOT DESIRE TO APPEASE THE ANGER OF THE HEART ITS PURPOSE IS BY PUNISHMENT TO PROTECT OTHERS
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE WAS COMMITTED FIRST THE OTHER LATER BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE AND OF SELF PROTECTION MOREOVER
THE LAW OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PUNISH THE AGGRESSOR BUT WILL NOT TAKE REVENGE THIS PUNISHMENT HAS FOR ITS END TO WARN TO PROTECT AND TO OPPOSE
THAN THE ANSWERS I HAVE GIVEN BUT IT IS NO ANSWER TO ASK ME HOW THE LAW CAN BE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT BARRISTERS I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I KNOW HOW THE ROADS CAN BE SWEPT
I ASKED JUST NOW WHAT WERE A BARRISTER'S IDEALS SUPPOSE WE ASK INSTEAD WHAT IS THE IDEAL BARRISTER IF ONE SPOKE LOOSELY OF AN IDEAL DOCTOR
BECOMES A BETTER FIGHTER AGAINST DISEASE ADVANCING HIMSELF NO DOUBT BUT ADVANCING ALSO MEDICAL SCIENCE JUST AS THE SCHOOLMASTER HAVING LEARNT NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF TEACHING
THIS IS VENGEANCE AND IT IS VERY REPREHENSIBLE NO RATHER HE MUST RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL AND NOT ONLY FORGIVE BUT ALSO IF POSSIBLE BE OF SERVICE TO HIS OPPRESSOR
THOUGH THEY DO NOT DESERVE MERCY AND BENEFICENCE NEVERTHELESS GOD TREATS THEM WITH MERCY AND FORGIVES THEM NOW VENGEANCE ACCORDING TO REASON IS ALSO BLAMEWORTHY
HE WOULD HAVE TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WALKING NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITY IT SEEMS TO ME THEN
BUT IN REALITY AS REGARDS THEMSELVES THEY ARE GOOD THE EPITOME OF THIS DISCOURSE IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE THING IN RELATION TO ANOTHER MAY BE EVIL
I WILL OFFER NO RESISTANCE AND I WILL FORGIVE HIM
FOR MAN HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE BUT IF CRIMINALS WERE ENTIRELY FORGIVEN THE ORDER OF THE WORLD WOULD BE UPSET SO PUNISHMENT IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL NECESSITIES
SO CHRIST BESOUGHT FORGIVENESS FOR HIS MURDERERS THIS IS CALLED BOUNTY NOW THE QUESTION OF THE GOOD OR EVIL OF THINGS IS DETERMINED BY REASON OR BY LAW
THE RIGHT METHOD OF TREATING CRIMINALS QUESTION SHOULD A CRIMINAL BE PUNISHED
IS THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT THERE IS DARKNESS LIGHT IS AN EXISTING THING BUT DARKNESS IS NONEXISTENT WEALTH IS AN EXISTING THING
OR TO MAKE MORE POPULAR THE NEGLECTED BEAUTIES OF BARNET IF HE COULD HOPE THAT AFTER HIS THREE HUNDREDTH JOURNEY INQUISITIVE PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO FOLLOW HIM WONDERING WHAT HE WAS AFTER
WHEN NATIONS ATTACK YOU BURN YOUR HOMES PLUNDER YOUR GOODS ASSAULT YOUR WIVES CHILDREN AND RELATIVES AND VIOLATE YOUR HONOR YOU SHOULD BE SUBMISSIVE IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE TYRANNICAL FOES
ZAYD HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO KILL THE SON OF AMR IF HE DOES SO THIS IS VENGEANCE IF AMR DISHONORS ZAYD THE LATTER HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO DISHONOR AMR IF HE DOES SO
WITHOUT GETTING SOMEBODY TO SWEEP THEM BUT THAT WOULD NOT DISQUALIFY ME FROM SAYING THAT ROAD SWEEPING WAS AN UNATTRACTIVE PROFESSION
IF WE WERE OFFERED A THOUSAND A YEAR TO WALK FROM CHARING CROSS TO BARNET EVERY DAY REASONS OF POVERTY MIGHT COMPEL US TO ACCEPT THE OFFER
CRUELTY AND TRANSGRESSION SO THAT OTHER MEN MAY NOT BE TYRANNICAL BUT IF HE WHO HAS BEEN STRUCK PARDONS AND FORGIVES HE SHOWS THE GREATEST MERCY
THE COMMUNITIES MUST PUNISH THE OPPRESSOR THE MURDERER THE MALEFACTOR SO AS TO WARN AND RESTRAIN OTHERS FROM COMMITTING LIKE CRIMES BUT THE MOST ESSENTIAL THING
REGARD THEM AS MATTERS OF LAW NOT OF REASON THUS
ALTHOUGH FOR THE MALEFACTOR NONINTERFERENCE IS APPARENTLY A KINDNESS IT WOULD BE AN OPPRESSION TO MAN SH ADI
TO CAUSE THEM DAY BY DAY TO PROGRESS AND TO INCREASE IN SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE TO ACQUIRE VIRTUES TO GAIN GOOD MORALS AND TO AVOID VICES SO THAT CRIMES MAY NOT OCCUR
THOSE OUTWARD EXISTENCES WHICH THE EYES SEE ARE CALLED SENSIBLE INTELLECTUAL THINGS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVE NO OUTWARD EXISTENCE BUT ARE CONCEPTIONS OF THE MIND
SO THAT THE CRIME ITSELF WILL APPEAR TO THEM AS THE GREATEST CHASTISEMENT THE UTMOST CONDEMNATION AND TORMENT THEREFORE NO CRIMES WHICH REQUIRE PUNISHMENT WILL BE COMMITTED
WE FAIL OF COURSE THE PAINTER FINDS THAT MOTHER'S DARLING BRINGS IN THE STUFF AND HE TURNS OUT MOTHER'S DARLINGS MECHANICALLY
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL SIR JOHN SIMON'S MANNER IS THE MORE EFFECTIVE THERE MAY BE OTHER ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ASKED
BUT POVERTY IS NONEXISTING THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL EVILS RETURN TO NONEXISTENCE GOOD EXISTS EVIL IS NONEXISTENT
BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
IN THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE CAME A MESSENGER WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS COMING FROM THE PERSON WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PROCURE THE FOX'S LIVER SO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM I HAVE COME FROM MISTER SO AND SO
ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
SO THAT THEY RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BUT TWO OF THE BOYS HELD DOWN THE CUB AND SEIZING IT BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WENT OFF IN HIGH GLEE THE TWO FRIENDS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE AND ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS VOICE SHOUTED OUT
IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
WHICH YOU HAD JUST PROCURED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD COME AND TELL US THE PRICE ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD LODGE WITH A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE AND WENT AWAY THE VISITOR WAS MORE AND MORE LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND
THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
WHOSE PENNILESS CONDITION FORMS A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE WEALTH OF THEIR INFERIORS IN RANK THE DAIMIOS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH RANK CAN BE BOUGHT OR SOLD IN JAPAN
THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
TO BUY IT FOR ME HOW THE FOXES CAME TO HEAR OF THIS I DON'T KNOW BUT THE FOXES TO WHOM I HAD SHOWN KINDNESS KILLED THEIR OWN CUB AND TOOK OUT THE LIVER AND THE OLD DOG FOX DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER FROM THE PERSON TO WHOM
THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN RECITING PRAYERS AND PRAISES AND THE NEXT DAY THEY PUBLISHED THE MATTER TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND TO THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE INSTANCES OF MEN KILLING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO REQUITE A FAVOUR
YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUCCESSFULLY STUDYING THE ART OF HEALING AS PRACTISED IN THE WEST WHEN I WAS AT PEKING I SAW A CHINESE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE A DECOCTION OF THREE SCORPIONS FOR A CHILD STRUCK DOWN WITH FEVER
BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
WHEN HE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND SAID INDEED I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS KINDNESS WHICH WILL SAVE MY SON'S LIFE THEN THE GOOD WIFE CAME OUT AND RECEIVED THE JAR WITH EVERY MARK OF POLITENESS
ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
HOW COULD I STAND BY AND SEE LIFE TAKEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE I SPENT ONLY HALF A BU TO SAVE THE CUB BUT HAD IT COST A FORTUNE I SHOULD NOT HAVE GRUDGED IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTIMATE ENOUGH WITH ME TO KNOW MY HEART
LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN ON THE MORROW THE DAY DAWNED AND THE SUN CAME FORTH UP ROSE THE SHEPHERD UP ROSE THE MAIDEN TOO TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR GOING TO THE LAKE THE SHEPHERD WAS CHEERFUL MORE CHEERFUL THAN EVER
AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
AND GAVE HALF A BU TO THE THREE BOYS WHO RAN AWAY DELIGHTED THE MAN'S FRIEND UPON THIS SAID TO HIM WELL CERTAINLY YOU HAVE GOT QUEER TASTES WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FOX FOR
WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
WE HAD CONFIDED THE COMMISSION CAME HERE WITH IT HIS MATE HAS JUST BEEN AT MY PILLOW SIDE AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT HENCE IT WAS THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS MOVED TO TEARS
I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
ON THE SAME ERRAND AS THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN SAW THE FOXES THEY PICKED UP A BAMBOO STICK AND TOOK THE CREATURES STEALTHILY IN THE REAR AND WHEN THE OLD FOXES TOOK TO FLIGHT THEY SURROUNDED THEM AND BEAT THEM WITH THE STICK
THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
WHEN THE DRAGON CAME IN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO QUESTION IT WHERE IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU BEEN WHITHER DO YOU GO SO FAR YOU WILL NEVER TELL ME WHITHER YOU GO THE DRAGON REPLIED WELL MY DEAR OLD WOMAN I DO GO FAR
SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
HOW QUICKLY YOU FULFILLED OUR WISHES AND HOW KIND OF YOU TO SEND AT ONCE THE DOCTOR PREPARED THE MEDICINE AND NOW OUR BOY CAN GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND IT'S ALL OWING TO YOUR GOODNESS WAIT A BIT CRIED THE GUEST
AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY

AND DELIVERED HIM HER LADY'S MESSAGE WHICH WHEN HE HEARD HE WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING AND SAID TO HER KNOW THAT HAYAT AL NUFUS IS MY MISTRESS AND THAT I AM HER SLAVE AND THE CAPTIVE OF HER LOVE
AND THEY TWO SAT WHILST ARDASHIR STOOD BEFORE THEM THEN AROSE AN ORATOR OF THE KING ABD AL KADIR'S COURT AND PRONOUNCED AN ELOQUENT DISCOURSE GIVING THE PRINCE JOY OF THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS DESIRE
AFTER THIS THEY ABODE A LITTLE WHILE
HAD THEY CAUGHT ME AT JUST THE VERY THING THEY ARE DOING WITH SO MUCH ENJOYMENT MEN OFTEN CONDEMN OTHERS FOR WHAT THEY SEE NO WRONG IN DOING THEMSELVES THE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT
THERE WAS ONCE A WOLF WHO GOT VERY LITTLE TO EAT BECAUSE THE DOGS OF THE VILLAGE WERE SO WIDE AWAKE AND WATCHFUL HE WAS REALLY NOTHING BUT SKIN AND BONES AND IT MADE HIM VERY DOWNHEARTED TO THINK OF IT
AND AMONGST THE REST FIFTY THOUSAND DINARS FOR THE NUPTIAL FESTIVITIES AFTER WHICH THEY FETCHED THE KAZIS AND THE WITNESSES WHO WROTE OUT THE CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS AND IT WAS A NOTABLE DAY
AND RETURNED THANKS TO ALMIGHTY ALLAH SUCH WAS HER CASE BUT AS REGARDS ARDASHIR HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS FATHER THAT NIGHT AND THE GREAT KING QUESTIONED HIM OF HIS CASE
NEWS OF THE MULTITUDE OF HER LOVER'S TROOPS CAME TO HAYAT AL NUFUS WHO WAS STILL JAILED BY HER SIRE'S COMMANDMENT TILL THEY KNEW WHAT HE SHOULD ORDER RESPECTING HER WHETHER PARDON AND RELEASE OR DEATH AND BURNING
THEN CAME THE WAZIRS AND CHAMBERLAINS AND CAPTAINS AND GUARDS AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE THE PRINCE AND REJOICED IN HIS COMING AND IT WAS A GREAT DAY WITH THEM FOR ENJOYMENT
I WAS IN MY WRATH BUT SPEAK THE TRUTH ERE THOU LOSE THY LIFE AND SAID THE SWORDER O KING HE IS YET IN THE CHAINS OF LIFE

THEREUPON QUOTH ARDASHIR BY THY WORSHIP I WILL NOT STIR FROM BEFORE THEE TILL I HAVE CLEARED MY HONOUR AND THE HONOUR OF THY DAUGHTER FROM THAT WHICH THOU LAIDEST TO OUR CHARGE FOR SHE IS A PURE VIRGIN
THE KING ROBED HIM WITH A SPLENDID ROBE OF HONOUR AND ORDERED HIM TEN THOUSAND DUCATS WHEREUPON HE KISSED HIS HANDS THANKING HIM FOR HIS BOUNTY AND BENEFICENCE AND WENT HIS WAYS
HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF THIS AND FELL LAMENTING FOR THAT THE MOST PART OF HIS EXISTENCE WAS PAST AND HE HAD NOT BEEN VOUCHSAFED A SON TO INHERIT THE KINGDOM AFTER HIM
NOR LONG TO BLAME NOR LITTLE TO GAINSAY O'ERFALL HER ANKLETS TRESSES BLACK AS NIGHT YET IN HER FACE RESPLENDS ETERNAL DAY THE KING SEEING HER MARVELLED AT HER BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS
WHEREUPON HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FIRST AND LAST THEN QUOTH THE KING WHAT WILT THOU HAVE ME DO FOR THEE O MY SON

ADVANCED TO MEET HIM AND EMBRACED HIM WHILST JOY AND GLADNESS SPREAD AMONG
HE ORDERED HIM TEN THOUSAND DINARS AND BADE HIM CARRY THE ANSWER TO THE GREAT KING AND CRAVE LEAVE FOR HIM TO PAY HIM A VISIT HEARING AND OBEYING ANSWERED THE MINISTER AND RETURNING TO HIS MASTER
WHEREIN ALL LOVERS MADE MERRY AND ALL HATERS AND ENVIERS WERE MORTIFIED THEY SPREAD THE MARRIAGE FEASTS AND BANQUETS AND LASTLY ARDASHIR WENT IN UNTO THE PRINCESS AND FOUND HER A JEWEL WHICH HAD BEEN HIDDEN
SO HE FAREWELLED HIM AND HIS SON AFTER HE HAD STRAINED HIM TO HIS BREAST AND KISSED HIM BETWEEN THE EYES AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS GRACE AND FAVOURS AND COMMENDED HIS DAUGHTER TO HIS CARE THEN HE WENT IN TO THE PRINCESS
TILL HE HAVE MADE HIM SET HER FREE AND TAKEN SURETY FROM AND MADE COVENANT WITH HIM THAT HE WILL NOT GO ABOUT TO PUT HER TO DEATH NOR WORK HER AUGHT OF HARM THIS IS HER LAST WORD TO THEE MAY ALLAH NOT DESOLATE HER OF THEE
REPLIED I HEAR AND OBEY FOR MY PART I MAKE NO OBJECTION AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE PLEASURABLE TO ME BUT THE GIRL IS OF FULL AGE AND REASON AND HER AFFAIR IS IN HER OWN HAND
HE CAST OVER HIS SHOULDERS A COSTLY ROBE AND CROWNED HIM WITH A CORONET OF JEWELS HE ALSO GIRT HIM WITH A GIRDLE OF SILK PURFLED WITH RED GOLD AND SET WITH PEARLS AND GEMS AND MOUNTED HIM ON ONE OF HIS NOBLEST MARES
FOR I WILL NOT RETURN TO MY COUNTRY WITHOUT HER THEN THE HANDMAID RETURNED TO HAYAT AL NUFUS AND KISSING HER HANDS DELIVERED TO HER THE MESSAGE WHICH WHEN SHE HEARD SHE WEPT FOR VERY JOY
THERE WAS ONCE IN DAYS OF YORE
AND EMBRACED HER AND SHE KISSED HIS HANDS AND THEY WEPT IN THE STANDING PLACE OF PARTING AFTER THIS HE RETURNED TO HIS CAPITAL AND ARDASHIR AND HIS COMPANY FARED ON TILL THEY REACHED SHIRAZ
LEAVE TO COME FORTH TO VISIT HIM SO ON THE MORROW HE TOOK HORSE AND RODE TO THE CAMP OF THE GREAT KING WHO CAME TO MEET HIM AND SALUTING HIM SEATED HIM IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR AND GAVE HIM WELCOME
AT THE DOOR IS A SLAVE GIRL WITH HER MERCHANT AND FAIRER THAN SHE EYE HATH NEVER SEEN QUOTH THE KING HITHER TO ME WITH MERCHANT AND MAID
WHOSE LATTICED CASEMENTS OVERLOOKED THE MAIN
MY GOLD O MY GOLD CRIED THE MISER WILDLY
AND CEASED NOT TO BE HEAVY AT HEART FEARING THE LAYING WASTE OF HIS REIGN AND THE SPOILING OF HIS REALM WHEN BEHOLD THE WAZIR CAME IN TO HIM AND SALUTING HIM KISSED GROUND BEFORE HIM
AFTER THEY HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE
SO THE WOLF SPOKE VERY HUMBLY TO THE DOG COMPLIMENTING HIM ON HIS FINE APPEARANCE YOU CAN BE AS WELL FED AS I AM IF YOU WANT TO REPLIED THE DOG LEAVE THE WOODS THERE YOU LIVE MISERABLY
WITH SELLE AND TRAPPINGS OF GOLD INLAID WITH PEARLS AND JEWELS THEN HE BADE HIS GRANDEES AND CAPTAINS MOUNT ON HIS SERVICE AND ESCORT HIM TO HIS FATHER'S PRESENCE AND CHARGED HIM TELL HIS SIRE
LEAVE FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO EQUIP HER FOR DEPARTURE SO HE EQUIPPED HER AND MOUNTED HER IN A TAKHTRAWAN A TRAVELLING LITTER OF RED GOLD INLAID WITH PEARLS AND GEMS AND DRAWN BY NOBLE STEEDS
AND HIS BREAST BROADENED AND HE WAS A MOST HAPPY MAN KING SAYF AL A'AZAM
AND HE ANSWERED YES O KING KNOW THAT I WOULD FAIN TAKE MY WREAK OF THE WAZIR WHO ENTREATED US ON EVIL WISE AND THE EUNUCH WHO FORGED A LIE AGAINST US
THERE IN THAT HOLE WHY DID YOU PUT IT THERE WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP IT IN THE HOUSE WHERE YOU COULD EASILY GET IT WHEN YOU HAD TO BUY THINGS BUY SCREAMED THE MISER ANGRILY WHY I NEVER TOUCHED THE GOLD
DELIVERED HIM THE REPLY AND ABD AL KADIR'S MESSAGE AND REPEATED ALL THEIR TALK WHEREAT HE REJOICED GREATLY
AND NOT ONE BUT REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY THEN THE KING THREW HIS ARMS ABOUT ARDASHIR'S NECK AND ENTREATED HIM WITH ALL WORSHIP AND HONOUR BIDDING HIS CHIEF EUNUCHS BEAR HIM TO THE BATH WHEN HE CAME OUT
NOT TO SPEAK OF KIND WORDS AND CARESSES THE WOLF HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VISION OF HIS COMING HAPPINESS THAT HE ALMOST WEPT BUT JUST THEN HE NOTICED THAT THE HAIR ON THE DOG'S NECK WAS WORN AND THE SKIN WAS CHAFED WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR NECK
FOR INDEED SHE ENDURETH ALL THESE TRIALS FOR THY SAKE BUT AN THIS SEEM NOT GOOD TO THEE FOR THAT THY DESIRE OF HER IS AT AN END STILL SPEAK TO THY SIRE SO HAPLY HE MAY INTERCEDE FOR HER WITH HER FATHER AND HE DEPART NOT
TILL THE WAZIR LAID THE PRESENT BEFORE HIM WHEN HE SAW IT TO BE SUCH GIFT AS NO MONEY COULD PURCHASE NOR COULD ONE OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH AVAIL TO THE LIKE THEREOF
HEARKENING TO AND OBEYING HIM IN WHATSO HE SHOULD BID OR FORBID I WILL NOT FAIL OF THIS ANSWERED ARDASHIR AND FAREWELLING HIM REPAIRED TO HIS FATHER WHO AT SIGHT OF HIM WAS TRANSPORTED FOR DELIGHT AND SPRINGING UP
CONSIDERING THE NOBILITY OF HIS SPIRIT AND THE LOFTINESS OF HIS DIGNITY BUT IT WAS HIS LOVE AND INCLINATION TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER THAT TO THIS HAD CONSTRAINED HIM MEANWHILE
THAT THE BONDMAID SENT BY HAYAT AL NUFUS
SHE PURSUED IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE CHIEF EUNUCH OF THE HARIM HAVING INFORMED THE PRINCESS HOW SHE HAD BEEN DEMANDED IN MARRIAGE BY THE GREAT KING AND HAVING HEARD HER REPLY
WICKED DEEDS WILL NOT STAY HID THE MISER A MISER HAD BURIED HIS GOLD IN A SECRET PLACE IN HIS GARDEN EVERY DAY HE WENT TO THE SPOT
HE GROANED AND CRIED AND TORE HIS HAIR
HE ROSE UP STANDING AND RECEIVED HIM WITH HONOUR BUT THE MINISTER MADE HASTE TO FALL AT HIS FEET AND KISSING THEM CRIED PARDON O KING OF THE AGE THE LIKE OF THEE SHOULD NOT RISE TO THE LIKE OF ME FOR I AM THE LEAST OF SERVANTS SLAVES
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHTH NIGHT
COMPLETE IN GRAVITY AND GRACIOUS WAY NOR OVERTALL NOR OVERSHORT THE WHILE TOO FULL FOR TROUSERS ARE THOSE HIPS THAT SWAY HER SHAPE IS MIDMOST TWIXT O'ER SMALL AND TALL

DEMANDING OF HIM THE MINISTER AND THE CASTRATO WHEREUPON HE DESPATCHED THEM BOTH TO HIM
FOR THE KING'S SON GAVE LEAVE TO THOSE OF KING ABD AL KADIR'S OFFICERS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AND OTHERS OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO VIEW THE ORDINANCE OF HIS FATHER'S HOST WITHOUT LET OR STAY
AND I WOULDN'T TAKE ALL THE TENDER YOUNG LAMBS IN THE WORLD AT THAT PRICE AND AWAY RAN THE WOLF TO THE WOODS
WITH ALL THE LORDS OF HIS LAND TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS SON IN LAW AND DAUGHTER
AND THEY ABODE IN ALL COMFORT AND SOLACE AND JOYANCE OF LIFE TILL THERE CAME TO THEM THE DESTROYER OF DELIGHTS AND SEVERER OF SOCIETIES THE DEPOPULATOR OF PALACES AND THE GARNERER OF GRAVEYARDS
I WILL LAY WASTE HIS LANDS AND SPOIL HIS HOARDS AND DISHONOUR HIS HOUSE
SHE FEARED LEST HE SHOULD BE DIVERTED FROM HER BY HIS SIRE AND FORGET HER AND DEPART FROM HER WHEREUPON HER FATHER WOULD SLAY HER SO SHE CALLED A HANDMAID THAT WAS WITH HER IN HER APARTMENT BY WAY OF SERVICE AND SAID TO HER
RETURNED THEREWITH TO THE KING AND GAVE HIM THIS ANSWER WHEREAT HE REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND CALLING FOR A COSTLY ROBE OF HONOUR THREW IT OVER THE WAZIR'S SHOULDERS FURTHERMORE
THAT A THIEF WHO HAD BEEN OBSERVING HIM GUESSED WHAT IT WAS THE MISER HAD HIDDEN AND ONE NIGHT QUIETLY DUG UP THE TREASURE AND MADE OFF WITH IT WHEN THE MISER DISCOVERED HIS LOSS HE WAS OVERCOME WITH GRIEF AND DESPAIR
