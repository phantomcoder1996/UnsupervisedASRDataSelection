YOU LIKE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'D NEVER DARE UN SHE BROKE THE WORD IN TWO AND HER QUICK BLUSH MADE HER FACE LIKE A SHALLOW PETALLED ROSE
SHE COULD HARDLY CONCEIVE OF WANTING THE KIND OF LOVE THAT WAS A STATE ONE COULD BE COZENED INTO DARROW PUTTING AWAY THE FRAME WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AND SHE FELT HE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL TO SAY
SHE PAUSED AGAIN AND THEN EXCLAIMED
IS THAT THE WAY THEY MADE YOU FEEL DIDN'T THEY YOU AS IF THE GODS WERE THERE ALL THE WHILE JUST BEHIND THEM PULLING THE STRINGS HER HANDS WERE PRESSED AGAINST THE RAILING HER FACE SHINING AND DARKENING UNDER THE WING BEATS OF SUCCESSIVE IMPRESSIONS
SHE TOOK A FEW HESITATING STEPS AND THEN PAUSED AGAIN DARROW NOTICED THAT SHE HAD GROWN PALE AND THAT THERE WERE RINGS OF SHADE ABOUT HER EYES YOU'VE KNOWN MISSUS LEATH A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HIM SUDDENLY
SHE BROKE OFF CONFUSED AND HE QUESTIONED WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THE COLOUR ROSE TO HER FOREHEAD HOW COULD SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE SCARCELY DARED OWN TO HERSELF
SHE LET HER AMUSED SCRUTINY DWELL ON HIM BUT HOW COULD YOU SHE WAS FALSE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU SO EMPHATICALLY REFUSED TO LET ME HELP YOU TO A START SHE STOPPED SHORT AND FACED HIM AND YOU THINK I MAY LET YOU NOW DARROW FELT THE BLOOD IN HIS CHEEK HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER ATTITUDE
SHE TRIED TO DEVISE MEANS OF KEEPING THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY THE NURSE FOUND AN EXCUSE FOR FOLLOWING MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS TO THE PURPLE SITTING ROOM
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL
THE OLD DELUSION I SUPPOSE
FOR AT A CERTAIN POINT HER IMAGINATION ALWAYS TURNED BACK BUT IF IT WERE A MERE LINK IN A CHAIN OF SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS THE THOUGHT OF IT DISHONOURED HER WHOLE PAST EFFIE IN THE INTERREGNUM BETWEEN GOVERNESSES HAD BEEN GIVEN LEAVE TO DINE DOWNSTAIRS
WHATEVER WORDS HE CHOSE HE SEEMED TO STUMBLE AMONG REMINDERS OF THEIR PAST SHE WALKED ON BESIDE HIM HER EYES ON THE GROUND THEN I'M TO UNDERSTAND DEFINITELY THAT YOU DO RENEW YOUR OFFER SHE ASKED
AND WAS RESOLUTELY BENT ON HOLDING HER TO HER OWN PURPOSE OF BEHAVING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED ONCE MORE SHE INWARDLY ACCUSED HIM OF INSENSIBILITY AND HER IMAGINATION WAS BESET BY TORMENTING VISIONS OF HIS PAST HAD SUCH THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
BUT HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WITH THE SECURING OF MISS VINER'S PEACE OF MIND ONLY A PART OF HIS OBLIGATION WAS DISCHARGED AND THAT WITH THAT PART HIS REMAINING DUTY WAS IN CONFLICT IT HAD BEEN HIS FIRST BUSINESS TO CONVINCE THE GIRL
HE PASSED OVER THE OBVIOUS REPLY BUT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW THE PROFESSION IS OVER CROWDED I KNOW I'M TRITE I'VE A VERY CLEAR IDEA BUT I COULDN'T GO ON AS I WAS
OH NOW OWEN NOW I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE I'LL EVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN I AM NOW LET OWEN HAVE HIS TEA FIRST HER MOTHER SUGGESTED BUT THE YOUNG MAN DECLINING THE OFFER PROPPED HIS GUN AGAINST THE WALL AND LIGHTING A CIGARETTE
HE HAD DONE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE TO REASSURE THE GIRL AND SHE HAD APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED THE SINCERITY OF HIS INTENTION HE HAD PATCHED UP AS DECENT A CONCLUSION AS HE COULD TO AN INCIDENT THAT SHOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD NO SEQUEL
THEN HE DROPPED AGAIN INTO HIS ARMCHAIR WITH A SIGH OF DEEP CONTENT OH HANG IT HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
SHE THREW THE WORDS OFF WITH A HALF IRONIC SMILE
IN THE HALL COMING DOWN THE STAIRS HE ENCOUNTERED ANNA HER FACE WAS SERENE
BUT IT'S BARELY TEN MINUTES PAST LET'S AT LEAST WALK A LITTLE WAY TOWARD THE RIVER SHE GLANCED DOWN THE LONG WALK AHEAD OF THEM AND THEN BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE IF YOU LIKE
AS FOR THE PRIVATE AND PERSONAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE IT HAD COME UP TO THE CURRENT STANDARDS AND IF IT HAD DROPPED NOW AND THEN BELOW A MORE IDEAL MEASURE EVEN THESE DECLINES HAD BEEN BRIEF PARENTHETIC INCIDENTAL
NO SHE HEARD FROM ADELAIDE THAT I WAS IN PARIS AND SHE CAME SHE CAME BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO URGE ME TO MARRY YOU
HIS OWN IDEAS ABOUT SOPHY VINER WERE TOO MIXED AND INDETERMINATE FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THE RISK OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT YET HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE INTOLERABLE POSITION OF APPEARING TO PRESS IT ON THE WOMAN HE DESIRED ABOVE ALL OTHERS TO PROTECT
HIS MIND TURNED AGAIN TO HIS FIRST MEETING WITH ANNA SUMMERS AND TOOK UP ONE BY ONE THE THREADS OF THEIR FAINTLY SKETCHED ROMANCE HE DWELT WITH PARDONABLE PRIDE ON THE FACT THAT FATE HAD SO EARLY MARKED HIM FOR THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF POSSESSING HER IT SEEMED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD REALLY
AND THEN THEIR REAL LIFE WOULD BEGIN STUDY TRAVEL AND BOOK MAKING FOR HIM AND FOR HER WELL THE JOY AT ANY RATE OF GETTING OUT OF AN ATMOSPHERE OF BRIC A BRAC AND CARD LEAVING INTO THE OPEN AIR OF COMPETING ACTIVITIES
AND THAT WHICH ENFOLDED DARROW AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS SEEMED TO HIS WATCHFUL PERCEPTIONS TO BE QUIVERING WITH CROSS THREADS OF COMMUNICATION AT FIRST HE WAS AWARE ONLY OF THOSE THAT CENTRED IN HIS OWN TROUBLED CONSCIOUSNESS
THE MUFFLED SUNLIGHT GLEAMED LIKE GOLD TISSUE THROUGH GREY GAUZE AND THE BEECH ALLEYS TAPERED AWAY TO A BLUE HAZE BLENT OF SKY AND FOREST
SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE SMILED AT HER SCRUPLES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AS SHE LOOKED BACK ON THEM THEY SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE OLD IGNORANT TIMOROUS TIME WHEN SHE HAD FEARED TO LOOK LIFE IN THE FACE AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO THE MYSTERIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART BECAUSE HER OWN HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE SIGNED TO A MOTOR CAB CALLING OUT TO THE DRIVER TO THE BOIS AS THE CARRIAGE TURNED TOWARD THE TUILERIES SHE ROUSED HERSELF I MUST GO FIRST TO THE HOTEL THERE MAY BE A MESSAGE AT ANY RATE I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING
AND SOON AFTER LUNCHEON THE THREE SET FORTH IN THE MOTOR TO SHOW DARROW A CHATEAU FAMOUS IN THE ANNALS OF THE REGION DURING THEIR EXCURSION ANNA FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS FROM HIS DEMEANOUR IF EFFIE'S PRESENCE BETWEEN THEM WAS AS MUCH OF A STRAIN TO HIS COMPOSURE AS TO HERS
DARROW STOOD STILL IN THE PATH BEHIND HIM HE HEARD EFFIE'S CALL AND AT THE CHILD'S VOICE HE SAW SOPHY TURN HER HEAD WITH THE ALERTNESS OF ONE WHO IS OBSCURELY ON THE WATCH
IN FACT I USED TO SAY TO JIMMY JUST TO MAKE HIM WILD
HE DREW UP A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AFTER ALL HE SAID IN A TONE OF GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST
IF I'D EVER CARED A STRAW FOR HER I SHOULD KNOW HOW TO AVOID HURTING HER NOW AND HIS INSENSIBILITY STRUCK HIM AS NO BETTER THAN A VULGAR OBTUSENESS BUT HE HAD A FIXED PURPOSE AHEAD AND COULD ONLY PUSH ON TO IT
OH IT'S NOT THAT SHE EXCLAIMED ALMOST IMPATIENTLY IT'S NOT PEOPLE I'M AFRAID OF THEY'VE NEVER PUT THEMSELVES OUT FOR ME WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEM HE LIKED HER DIRECTNESS AS HE HAD NEVER LIKED IT BEFORE WELL THEN WHAT IS IT
I SHA'N'T BE EFFIE'S GOVERNESS MUCH LONGER AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT DARROW TRIED TO MERGE HIS LOOK OF RELIEF INTO THE EXPRESSION OF FRIENDLY INTEREST WITH WHICH HE GRASPED HER HAND YOU REALLY DO AGREE WITH ME THEN
YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU THINK I'M SPITEFUL AND ENVIOUS YES I WAS ENVIOUS OF LADY ULRICA OH
THEY'RE SURE TO SEND FOR ME IN A DAY OR TWO NOW HE BEGAN SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE CONTINUED YOU'LL TELL ME BEFORE I GO WHAT DAY I'M TO COME BACK AND GET YOU
IS THAT ALL HE LAUGHED RELIEVED BY HER NATURALNESS LOOK HERE
MY WIFE OF HER TO ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE HE DRAPED THESE DETAILS IN THE HANDSOME PHRASE
AND THEY GAVE EACH OTHER A LONG KISS OF PROMISE AND COMMUNION THE MEMORY OF IT GLOWED IN HIM STILL AS HE SAT OVER HIS CRUMBLING FIRE BUT BENEATH HIS PHYSICAL EXULTATION HE FELT A CERTAIN GRAVITY OF MOOD
BUT THE WISH ISN'T DUE TO TO ANY PAST KINDNESS ON YOUR PART BUT SIMPLY TO MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU WHY NOT PUT IT THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE YOUR BENEFIT
DARROW AND SOPHY MOUNTED TOGETHER IN THE LIFT AND THE YOUNG MAN
HER STEADY GAZE WHEN HE SPOKE THE GRAVE FREEDOM OF HER GAIT AND GESTURES HE RECALLED EVERY DETAIL OF HER FACE
YOU DON'T AT ANY RATE KNOW ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO THE CONTRARY TO THE CONTRARY HOW SHOULD I
I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING SHE REPEATED
THEN HER FACE LEANED TO HIS WITH THE SLOW DROOP OF A FLOWER HE FELT AGAIN THE SWEEP OF THE SECRET TIDES AND ALL HIS FEARS WENT DOWN IN THEM
UNLOCKED HIS OWN DOOR AND GLANCED AT THE EMPTY TABLE
HOW I SHOULD LIKE HER IF I DIDN'T LOVE HER HE SUMMED IT UP
AND THE PLEASURE YOU'LL BE GIVING ME LET'S SHAKE HANDS ON IT
WHICH AT THE TIME HAD SEEMED TO SIMPLIFY THE INCIDENT NOW TURNED OUT TO BE ITS MOST GALLING COMPLICATION THE BARE TRUTH INDEED WAS THAT HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF HER AT ALL EITHER AT THE TIME OR SINCE AND THAT HE WAS ASHAMED TO BASE HIS JUDGEMENT OF HER
AND DARROW HAD LED MISS VINER OUT ON THE BALCONY OVERHANGING THE SQUARE BEFORE THE THEATRE HE TURNED TO SEE IF SHE SHARED HIS FEELINGS BUT THE RAPTUROUS LOOK SHE GAVE HIM CHECKED THE DEPRECIATION ON HIS LIPS OH WHY DID YOU BRING ME OUT HERE ONE OUGHT TO CREEP AWAY AND SIT IN THE DARK TILL IT BEGINS AGAIN
AND HER FACE AT THE SAME MOMENT UNDERWENT THE SAME CHANGE
AND THE GIRLISH THINNESS OF HER NECK ABOVE THE SLIGHT SWELL OF THE BREAST HIS IMAGINATION WAS STRUCK BY THE QUALITY OF RETICENCE IN HER BEAUTY
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR MADE THEM DRAW APART
IS IT TRUE IS IT REALLY TRUE
HIS GESTURE BRUSHED ASIDE THE ALLUSION MONEY MAY BE THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IT CAN'T BE THE WHOLE OF IT BETWEEN FRIENDS DON'T YOU THINK ONE FRIEND MAY ACCEPT A SMALL SERVICE FROM ANOTHER WITHOUT LOOKING TOO FAR AHEAD OR WEIGHING TOO MANY CHANCES
ESPECIALLY SUCH PRETTY ONES I SUPPOSE DARROW MADE NO COMMENT AND SHE CONTINUED AND MISSUS MURRETT'S OWN OPINION IF SHE'D OFFERED YOU ONE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OF MUCH VALUE ONLY IN SO FAR AS HER DISAPPROVAL WOULD ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN A GOOD MARK FOR MISS VINER
AND HIS MEETING WITH MISSUS LEATH THE PREVIOUS SPRING HAD GIVEN IT A DEFINITE DIRECTION WITH SUCH A COMRADE TO FOCUS AND STIMULATE HIS ENERGIES HE FELT MODESTLY BUT AGREEABLY SURE OF
AND CONJECTURING THAT HER GOVERNESS MIGHT BE WITH HER HE BETOOK HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING TO THE TERRACE WHENCE HE WANDERED ON TO THE GARDENS AND THE WALKS BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STILL AND PALE
SHE STOOD UP WITH A SMILING HEAD SHAKE
AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A STORM OR SOME OTHER NATURAL CATACLYSM SHE HAD NO LITERARY OR HISTORIC ASSOCIATIONS TO WHICH TO ATTACH HER IMPRESSIONS HER EDUCATION HAD EVIDENTLY NOT COMPRISED A COURSE IN GREEK LITERATURE
LET'S BE QUIET THEN IT'S THE BEST WAY OF TALKING YES BUT WE MUST SAVE IT UP TILL LATER
AN ANGLE KNOWN TO NO ONE BUT ITS POSSESSOR THE THOUGHT FLATTERED HIS SENSE OF POSSESSORSHIP
IT'S NOT INDEED REAL COMPASSION PROMPTED HIM TO CONTINUE HAVE YOU ANY ANY INFLUENCE YOU CAN COUNT ON SHE GAVE A SOMEWHAT FLIPPANT LITTLE LAUGH NONE BUT MY OWN I'VE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER TO COUNT ON
SHE WAS EAGER TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY FORM OF DRAMATIC EXPRESSION WHICH THE METROPOLIS OF THINGS THEATRICAL HAD TO OFFER AND HER CURIOSITY RANGED FROM THE OFFICIAL TEMPLES OF THE ART TO ITS LESS HALLOWED HAUNTS HER SEARCHING ENQUIRIES ABOUT A PLAY WHOSE PRODUCTION
SHE ASKED LEANING OVER THE TABLE TO POUR HERSELF A SECOND CUP OF TEA HE LIKED HER QUICKNESS AT ANY RATE IT'S BETTER HE LAUGHED THAN YOUR THINKING I CAME FOR MISSUS MURRETT
WILL NATURE NEVER TIRE OF THE TRICK BUT HE KNEW IT WAS MORE THAN THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THEIR TALK WHEN HE FELT
TO WALK AFTER HER DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATRE
HIS GLANCE STRAYED DOWN THE GOLD ROOFED WINDINGS AHEAD OF THEM IT'S DELIGHTFUL YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER PLACED ONLY I WONDER A LITTLE AT YOUR HAVING SO COMPLETELY GIVEN UP ANY IDEA OF A DIFFERENT FUTURE
BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN A WAY THAT REMINDED DARROW OF HIS OWN CAGED WANDERINGS EFFIE PURSUED HIM WITH HER BLANDISHMENTS
OR TO CONFESS HER YIELDING IN THAT WAY AT FIRST HE WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED THEN HE SAW HOW HER ATTITUDE SIMPLIFIED HIS OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAD ALL THE INDECISION AND AWKWARDNESS OF INEXPERIENCE IT SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A CHILD AFTER ALL AND ALL HE COULD DO
HER OUTBURST DID NOT OFFEND THE YOUNG MAN
SHE LOOKED UP HER LIPS PARTED IN SURPRISE BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HE WENT ON I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME
AT DINNER THAT EVENING MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S SLENDER MONOLOGUE WAS THROWN OUT OVER GULFS OF SILENCE OWEN WAS STILL IN THE SAME STATE OF MOODY ABSTRACTION AS WHEN DARROW HAD LEFT HIM AT THE PIANO AND EVEN ANNA'S FACE TO HER FRIEND'S VIGILANT EYE
WHO WAS THERE IN YOUR TIME MISSUS BOLT AND MADEMOISELLE AND PROFESSOR DIDYMUS AND THE POLISH COUNTESS
SHE LIFTED HER EYES TO HIS FACE I THINK I ONLY WANTED TO SPEAK HER NAME IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD SEEM SO AFRAID OF IT IF I WERE REALLY AFRAID OF IT I SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU UP SHE SAID
TILL HE PUT AN ARM ABOUT HER SAYING YOU MUSTN'T STAY TILL YOU'RE CHILLED
AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND TO HIDE HIS SURPRISE HE ADDED LIGHTLY AH THEN YOU WILL HAVE PARIS AFTER ALL
LOSING ITS LOOK OF APPEALING CONFIDENCE WAS SUDDENLY SHARPENED BY DISTRUST YOU DIDN'T FORGET TO POST MY LETTER
BUT AS HIS EYE FELL ON MISS VINER HIS EXPRESSION ALTERED AS SUDDENLY AS HERS THE CHANGE FOR DARROW WAS LESS DEFINABLE BUT PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON IT STRUCK HIM AS MORE SHARPLY SIGNIFICANT
CERTAINLY IT WAS NOT THE MOST PROFITABLE WAY FOR A YOUNG MAN WITH A PRETTY COMPANION TO PASS THE GOLDEN HOURS OF A SPRING AFTERNOON
SHE LOOKED UP AND THEIR EYES EXCHANGED MEANINGS FOR A RAPID MINUTE
AT THE SAME MOMENT A DOUBT SHOT UP ITS SERPENT HEAD IN HIS OWN BOSOM
MINGLED WITH THESE SENSATIONS WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF ANOTHER ORDER HE REFLECTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN WITH WHOM ONE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC
DARROW TOOK A CHAIR BEHIND THE LITTLE GIRL SO THAT HE MIGHT LOOK ACROSS AT HER MOTHER IT WAS ALMOST A NECESSITY FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT TO LET HIS EYES REST ON ANNA'S FACE AND TO MEET NOW AND THEN THE PROUD SHYNESS OF HER GAZE MADAME DE CHANTELLE PRESENTLY ENQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF OWEN
CAN'T YOU TRUST ME ABOUT THAT TOO TRUST YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN
IF THE EPISODE HAD BEEN AN ISOLATED ACCIDENT
WAIT A MINUTE PLEASE MISS VINER ANNA SAID
SHE HUNG HER HEAD IN MEDITATION BUT I CAN'T STAY HOW CAN I STAY SHE BROKE OUT AS IF ARGUING WITH SOME UNSEEN MONITOR WHY CAN'T YOU
HE HAD STAKED SOMETHING MORE ON IT AND HAD SOMEHOW IN THE SEQUEL HAD A MORE PALPABLE LOSS TO SHOW BUT THE PLAIN FACT WAS THAT HE HADN'T SPENT A PENNY ON IT WHICH WAS NO DOUBT THE REASON OF THE PRODIGIOUS SCORE IT HAD SINCE BEEN ROLLING UP
NO THERE'S NOTHING HE FEIGNED AN UNREGRETFUL SURPRISE SO MUCH THE BETTER AND NOW SHALL WE DRIVE OUT SOMEWHERE OR WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE A BOAT TO BELLEVUE HAVE YOU EVER DINED THERE ON THE TERRACE BY MOONLIGHT IT'S NOT AT ALL BAD
INSTANTLY EFFACED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF PURSUIT WELL THEN HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON HER HIS EYES PERSUADING HER HE WAS NOW INTENSELY AWARE THAT HIS NEARNESS WAS HAVING AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT LESS AND LESS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AND HE WENT ON
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
SOPHY'S BLUSH DEEPENED
IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT HIS ODD IRREGULAR FEATURES SEEMED TO GROW FLUID TO UNMAKE AND REMAKE THEMSELVES LIKE THE SHADOWS OF CLOUDS ON A STREAM DARROW THROUGH THE RAPID FLIGHT OF THE SHADOWS COULD NOT SEIZE ON ANY SPECIFIC INDICATION OF FEELING
HER CHIN ON HER HANDS WHAT RUBBISH WE TALK ABOUT INTENTIONS THE TRUTH IS I HADN'T ANY I JUST LIKED BEING WITH YOU PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY ONE CAN LIKE BEING WITH YOU I WAS DEPRESSED AND ADRIFT MYSELF AND YOU MADE ME FORGET MY BOTHERS
AND SO WOULD THE TIGER MEANWHILE SUCH EXPERTNESS QUALIFIED BY SUCH CANDOUR MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS THE EXTENT OF HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR TO ESTIMATE ITS EFFECT ON HER CHARACTER SHE MIGHT BE ANY ONE OF A DOZEN DEFINABLE TYPES OR SHE MIGHT
IT WAS NOT LITERATURE TO HER IT WAS FACT AS ACTUAL AS NEAR BY
AND THE SENSE OF REASSURANCE WHICH HIS PRESENCE GAVE HER WAS MERGED IN THE RELIEF OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK OF WHAT WAS BETWEEN THEM BUT THERE IT WAS INEVITABLY AND WHENEVER THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEY SAW IT IN HER DREAD OF GIVING IT A MORE TANGIBLE SHAPE
ON HIS MEAGRE MEMORY OF THEIR ADVENTURE THE ESSENTIAL CHEAPNESS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AS FAR AS HIS SHARE IN IT WAS CONCERNED CAME HOME TO HIM WITH HUMILIATING DISTINCTNESS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT AT THE TIME AT LEAST
HE POINTED OVER THEIR HEADS
AND SHE'S HEARD WHAT SHE CALLS DELIGHTFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU SO
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE TO STOP AND THINK WHETHER ONE CAN AFFORD A TELEGRAM BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO CONSIDER SUCH THINGS AND I MUSTN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER NOW
AND THE LOOSE HAIR UNDER HER HAT BRIM CLUNG TO HER FOREHEAD IN DAMP RINGS SHE LOOKED LIKE A YOUNG PRIESTESS STILL DAZED BY THE FUMES OF THE CAVERN YOU POOR CHILD IT'S BEEN ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A VAGUE SMILE
LOOK THERE ARE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER BUT JUST THIS MUST I GO NOW HE ADDED ALOUD SHE ANSWERED ABSENTLY IT MUST BE TIME TO DRESS
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
AND WHILE HE WAS AWAY THE DOCTOR AND THE REST OF THE ANIMALS
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
THE PRINCE LIFTED HIS FACE UP OUT OF THE BASIN BREATHING VERY HARD AND ALL THE ANIMALS CRIED OUT IN SURPRISE FOR THE PRINCE'S FACE HAD TURNED AS WHITE AS SNOW
HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH
I WONDER HOW SARAH'S GETTING ON AN EXCELLENT WOMAN IN SOME WAYS WELL WELL BUT THE SNOW CAME EARLIER THAN USUAL THAT YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THE OLD LAME HORSE HAULED IN PLENTY OF WOOD FROM THE FOREST OUTSIDE THE TOWN
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING THANKED THE SHARKS AGAIN FOR THEIR KINDNESS THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS SET OFF ONCE MORE ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME IN THE SWIFT SHIP WITH THE THREE RED SAILS AS THEY MOVED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
AND MAKE THEM INTO A LOT OF THIN STRINGS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN THE ENDS OF THESE STRINGS WERE TIED ON TO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE SWALLOWS TOOK HOLD OF THE STRINGS WITH THEIR FEET
FIGURED IT OUT THAT THERE WAS ONLY MONEY ENOUGH LEFT TO LAST ANOTHER WEEK IF THEY EACH HAD ONE MEAL A DAY AND NO MORE THEN THE PARROT SAID I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO DO THE HOUSEWORK OURSELVES AT LEAST WE CAN DO THAT MUCH AFTER ALL
THE PUSHMI PULLYU HEARD THEM COMING AND HE TRIED HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THE RING OF MONKEYS BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED
POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
AND THE MONKEYS TELL ME THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT IF I DO NOT LIKE IT IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN YOU WILL SEND ME BACK WHY CERTAINLY OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR
SO IN THIS WAY HE WENT ON GETTING MORE AND MORE PETS ONCE WHEN HE WAS SITTING ON HIS GARDEN WALL SMOKING A PIPE IN THE EVENING AN ITALIAN ORGAN GRINDER CAME ROUND WITH A MONKEY ON A STRING
I HAVE A FEELING IT ISN'T A FRIENDLY SHIP I AM AFRAID THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US JIP WHO WAS LYING NEAR TAKING A NAP IN THE SUN BEGAN TO GROWL AND TALK IN HIS SLEEP
HE WAS POORER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE WITH ALL THESE MOUTHS TO FILL AND THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER AND NO ONE TO DO THE MENDING AND NO MONEY COMING IN TO PAY THE BUTCHER'S BILL THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK VERY DIFFICULT BUT THE DOCTOR DIDN'T WORRY AT ALL
THERE ARE THICK SOFT CARPETS ON THE FLOORS THE DISHES ARE MADE OF SILVER AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK SPECIAL THINGS
AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES THAT SPEAK TO THEE I AM HIDING IN A ROSE BUD OH TELL ME FAIRY QUEEN CRIED BUMPO CLASPING HIS HANDS IN JOY
THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
GETTING THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH MUD THEY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE KING'S BACK GARDEN BY MISTAKE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUNNING UP AT ONCE AND CAUGHT THEM
AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
AND ASKED HER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE KING'S MEN AND LOCKED UP AGAIN WHISPERED POLYNESIA WE LOST OUR WAY IN THE JUNGLE
DON'T MOVE WHATEVER YOU DO AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS PRINCE BUMPO THE KING'S SON OPENING THE GARDEN GATE HE CARRIED A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES UNDER HIS ARM
AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
SHALL SCRUB MY KITCHEN FLOOR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE LED BACK TO PRISON AND LOCKED UP AND THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD THAT IN THE MORNING
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
THE PIRATES SHUT ME IN THERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING OFF TO STEAL THINGS FROM ANOTHER SHIP WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE CHOPPING ON THE DOOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS YOU
I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
THEY STUMBLED INTO WET BOGGY PLACES THEY GOT ALL TANGLED UP IN THICK CONVOLVULUS RUNNERS THEY SCRATCHED THEMSELVES ON THORNS AND TWICE THEY NEARLY
THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
FOR SURELY HE IS THE GREATEST OF MEN AND THE GRAND GORILLA WHO HAD THE STRENGTH OF SEVEN HORSES IN HIS HAIRY ARMS ROLLED A GREAT ROCK UP TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND SAID THIS STONE
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
WHO WAS PACKING THE TRUNK SAID COME IN AND CHEE CHEE VERY PROUDLY TOOK THE ANIMAL INSIDE AND SHOWED HIM TO THE DOCTOR WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT ASKED JOHN DOLITTLE GAZING AT THE STRANGE CREATURE
AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
BUT WITHOUT MONEY THEY FOUND IT VERY HARD THEN THE ANIMALS MADE A VEGETABLE AND FLOWER STALL OUTSIDE THE GARDEN GATE AND SOLD RADISHES AND ROSES TO THE PEOPLE THAT PASSED BY ALONG THE ROAD BUT STILL
MONEY IS A NUISANCE HE USED TO SAY WE'D ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED WHAT DOES MONEY MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE HAPPY BUT SOON THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GET WORRIED
THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
IN A SWIFT SHIP AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO ABOUT IT WHEN THE SWALLOWS HEARD THIS THEY ALL CAME DOWN ON TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM TO UNRAVEL SOME PIECES OF LONG ROPE
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
IN ALL WEATHERS FOR PUSHMI PULLYUS NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD EVER BEEN CAUGHT EVEN THEN YEARS AGO HE WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WITH TWO HEADS WELL
SO YOU ARE CAUGHT AGAIN THIS TIME YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE TAKE THEM ALL BACK TO PRISON AND PUT DOUBLE LOCKS ON THE DOOR
SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
IT WAS ALL THAT STUPID PIG'S FAULT SAID POLYNESIA HE WOULD KEEP RUNNING OFF THE PATH HUNTING FOR GINGER ROOTS AND I WAS KEPT SO BUSY
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT IN YOUR LIFE
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
SO THE PRINCE PROMISED AND WENT AWAY TO GET A SHIP READY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS DONE THE DOCTOR ASKED DAB DAB
BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
THE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM CHEE CHEE WHICH IS A COMMON WORD IN MONKEY LANGUAGE MEANING GINGER AND ANOTHER TIME
IT ISN'T AN ALLIGATOR SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S A CROCODILE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT SAID HIS SISTER IT'S A NASTY THING TO FIND UNDER THE BED I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
TALKING IN A SMALL HIGH VOICE LIKE A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALOUD BUMPO SOME ONE MIGHT TURN THEE INTO A WHITE PRINCE PERCHANCE THE KING'S SON
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE GOING ON ALONE POLYNESIA SAID WE MUST TREAD SOFTLY AND TALK LOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE LAND OF THE JOLLIGINKI
THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF GETTING OUT THEN GUB GUB BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN ALL THIS TIME POLYNESIA WAS STILL SITTING IN THE TREE IN THE PALACE GARDEN
AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
SWEEPING HIS TAIL OVER THE FLOOR WITH A RAG TIED ONTO IT FOR A BROOM AFTER A LITTLE THEY GOT TO DO THE WORK SO WELL THAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD HIS HOUSE KEPT SO TIDY OR SO CLEAN BEFORE IN THIS WAY
STARTED UP OFF THE SEAT AND LOOKED ALL AROUND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR HE CRIED METHOUGHT THE SWEET MUSIC OF A FAIRY'S SILVER VOICE
WHEN THE CIRCUS MEN CAME TO TAKE HIM BACK HE GOT SO WILD AND SAVAGE THAT HE FRIGHTENED THEM AWAY BUT TO EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS ALWAYS AS GENTLE AS A KITTEN BUT NOW
AFTER A MOMENT TOO TOO SAID
BUT I SUFFER HUNGER AND THIRST SO GIVE ME A TRIFLE THE HUNTER WAS SORRY FOR THE POOR OLD WOMAN AND HE FELT IN HIS POCKET AND GAVE HER ALL HE COULD SPARE HE WAS GOING ON THEN BUT THE OLD WOMAN STOPPED HIM AND SAID
IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
THAT IS TO SAY THE PRINCE THOUGH THEY DID NOT KNOW HE WAS ANYTHING BUT A TRUE SWINEHERD LET NO DAY PASS WITHOUT MAKING SOMETHING AND ONE DAY HE MADE A RATTLE
THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW SHE COULD LIVE ANY LONGER AND WHEN IT WAS EVENING SHE CLIMBED A LITTLE TREE AND WISHED THAT THE NIGHT WOULD NOT COME BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF THE WILD BEASTS
KNOCKED ALL HIS FOUR HORSES ON THE HEAD SKINNED THEM
AND IN THE MORNING THEY TOLD THEIR MASTER AND WHEN SHE HAD WASHED UP ON THE THIRD NIGHT SHE BIT THE THIRD NUT AND THERE WAS A STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL DRESS INSIDE THAT WAS MADE OF PURE GOLD
BY HIS BLOOD STAINED HANDS HE MADE NO STRUGGLE TO GET HIGHER FOR ALL HIS STRENGTH HAD LEFT HIM AND SEEING NO HOPE HE CALMLY AWAITED DEATH THEN
THE OLD WITCH GREW ANGRY AND SAID SUCH A CLOAK IS A WONDERFUL THING IT IS SELDOM TO BE HAD IN THE WORLD AND HAVE IT I MUST AND WILL SHE BEAT THE MAIDEN AND SAID THAT IF SHE DID NOT OBEY IT WOULD GO ILL WITH HER
HE SAYS YES BUT THAT THE DEVIL LOOKS SO UGLY THAT WE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE HIM OH I'M NOT AT ALL AFRAID WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF IN THE SHAPE OF A SEXTON
REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
THEN HE DRANK A SECOND AND THE SWORD BEGAN TO MOVE BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD DRUNK A THIRD DROP WAS HE ABLE TO SWING THE SWORD OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE HID HIMSELF IN THE CASTLE
AND THE LADIES IN WAITING PLACED THEMSELVES IN FRONT AND THEN SPREAD OUT THEIR DRESSES SO THE SWINEHERD GOT HIS TEN KISSES AND SHE GOT THE POT WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WAS THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THE WHOLE DAY THE POT WAS MADE TO BOIL
AND WORKED AT THE EMPTY LOOMS TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO KNOW HOW FAR THEY HAVE GOT ON WITH THE CLOTH THOUGHT THE EMPEROR BUT HE REMEMBERED WHEN HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WHOEVER WAS STUPID OR NOT FIT FOR HIS OFFICE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
WHOSE BRANCHES ALMOST PUT THEIR EYES OUT BUT THE LITTLE SISTER TIED THE TWIGS TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF RIBBON AND THEY GOT PAST SAFELY AND AFTER RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD CAME OUT ON TO THE OPEN FIELDS
I SAY SAID THE FARMER HE MUST BE UGLY YOU MUST KNOW THAT I CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT A SEXTON BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER I KNOW THAT IT IS THE DEVIL AND I SHA'N'T MIND I FEEL UP TO IT NOW BUT HE MUST NOT COME TOO NEAR ME
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO SPEAK LOUD FOR SHE IS VERY HARD OF HEARING OH YES CERTAINLY I WILL SAID THE HOST AND POURING OUT A LARGE GLASS OF MEAD HE TOOK IT OUT TO THE DEAD GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SITTING UPRIGHT IN THE CART HERE IS A GLASS OF MEAD FROM YOUR SON
BUT DID NOT DECLINE THE PROPOSAL ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE WAS A PRUDENT MONARCH AND KNEW THAT THE CRAB WAS LIKELY TO BE A PRINCE IN DISGUISE HE SAID THEREFORE TO THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE GO OLD WOMAN AND TELL THE CRAB I WILL GIVE HIM MY DAUGHTER IF BY TO MORROW MORNING
BUT I CAN'T CARRY YOU IN A SACK TO THE RIVER YOU ARE TOO HEAVY FOR ME
BEING SOMETHING OF A SWIMMER HE AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO KICK THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE BARREL
AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
ALAS MY LOVE SHE REPLIED OVER THERE LIES THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE COSTLY PRECIOUS STONES GROW I HAVE A GREAT LONGING TO GO THERE SO THAT WHEN I THINK OF IT I AM VERY SAD FOR WHO CAN FETCH THEM
COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
WHICH BY THE PALE RAYS OF THE MOON LOOKED LIKE A DIM LAMP AND HE SAW THE HIGH WINDOWS AND ROUND ONE OF THEM A BALCONY IN WHICH THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS SAT LOST IN SAD THOUGHTS
AND HOW SHE HAD SEARCHED A VERY LONG TIME AND MUST WANDER OVER MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TILL SHE FOUND HIM THEN THE OLD TOAD SAID LITTLE GREEN TOAD WHOSE LEG DOTH TWIST
AND FOUND THE HUT WHERE THE OLD WITCH LIVED THE POOR WIFE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW SHE HAD BEEN TOLD IN A DREAM OF THE WITCH'S POWER TO HELP HER THE WITCH COUNSELLED HER TO GO TO THE POND THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A FULL MOON
THEY WERE ALL VERY MUCH SURPRISED BUT THEY GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN THE OLD MAN CAME TO TAKE AWAY THE PLATE WHICH HAD CONTAINED THE CRAB'S DINNER HE FOUND IT FULL OF GOLD AND AS THE SAME THING HAPPENED EVERY DAY HE SOON BECAME VERY FOND OF THE CRAB
THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
IT SEEMS SO TO ME TOO I THINK I HEAR MY FATHER BLOWING HIS HORN SO YOU ARE A SWINEHERD'S DAUGHTER GO AWAY AT ONCE AND LET THE KING'S DAUGHTER COME AND SAY TO HER THAT WHAT I FORETELL SHALL COME TO PASS AND IF SHE DOES NOT COME
FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
AND WHEN SHE SAW THE SALAD STANDING THERE READY COOKED SHE WAS ABOUT TO CARRY IT UP BUT ON THE WAY ACCORDING TO HER OLD HABIT SHE TASTED IT AND ATE A COUPLE OF LEAVES IMMEDIATELY THE CHARM WORKED
THERE COMES ONE OUT OF THE WOOD WHO HAS A WONDERFUL TREASURE IN HIS BODY WHICH WE MUST MANAGE TO POSSESS OURSELVES OF DARLING DAUGHTER WE HAVE MORE RIGHT TO IT THAN HE HE HAS A BIRD'S HEART IN HIM
HE THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT TO HAVE SUCH A CHANCE OF WINNING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SNATI NOTICED THAT HIS MASTER WAS AT A LOSS AND SAID TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT DISREGARD WHAT THE KING HAD ASKED HIM TO DO
BY THIS TIME THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM ANY HOUSE AND THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MAKING THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT THEY FOUND THEY HAD GOT LOST NOW
I KILLED HER IN ORDER TO GET A BUSHEL OF MONEY YOU ARE MAD SAID THE APOTHECARY DON'T MENTION SUCH THINGS OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR HEAD AND HE BEGAN TO TELL HIM WHAT A DREADFUL THING HE HAD DONE AND WHAT A WICKED MAN HE WAS
AND IT FELL TO THE BOTTOM BROKEN INTO A HUNDRED PIECES SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MY BONES HAD I TRUSTED MYSELF TO THEM SAID THE YOUTH SADLY AND HE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
THIS HAND SAID RING CAME OVER THE PARTITION DURING THE NIGHT
THAT MUST BE BECAUSE I HEARD PART OF THE SERVICE
THINKING THERE MUST BE SOME VERY RARE TREASURE THERE SO ONE DAY WHEN THE GIANT HAD GONE INTO THE FOREST HE TRIED TO GET INTO THE PARLOUR AND MANAGED TO GET THE DOOR OPEN HALF WAY THEN
OH YES I THINK SO
A GARDEN IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE FOUNTAINS OF WHICH THE FIRST MUST PLAY GOLD THE SECOND DIAMONDS AND THE THIRD BRILLIANTS SO THE OLD WOMAN HAD TO STRIKE AGAIN THREE TIMES UPON THE GROUND WITH THE ROD AND THE NEXT MORNING
HAD A MILK WHITE ONE THEN THEY OILED THE CORNERS OF THEIR MOUTHS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK MORE FLUENTLY ALL THE SERVANTS STOOD IN THE COURTYARD AND SAW THEM MOUNT THEIR STEEDS AND HERE BY CHANCE CAME THE THIRD BROTHER
I WILL TELL YOU THIS IN THE NORTH SEA LIES A DEAD SEA CAT THAT SHALL BE THEIR ROAST MEAT AND THE RIB OF A WHALE THAT SHALL BE THEIR SILVER SPOON AND THE HOLLOW FOOT OF A DEAD HORSE THAT SHALL BE THEIR WINEGLASS
SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
OVER ALL THE FIVE HORSES FOR THEY WERE INDEED AS GOOD AS HIS ON THIS ONE DAY THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND ALL THE BELLS IN THE CHURCH TOWERS WERE PEALING THE PEOPLE WERE DRESSED IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND WERE GOING TO CHURCH
AND BY THE TIME SNATI CAME TO HELP HIM THE OX HAD NEARLY GOT HIM UNDER BUT SNATI WAS NOT SLOW IN HELPING HIS MASTER TO KILL IT EACH OF THEM THEN BEGAN TO FLAY THEIR OWN OX
SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
AND HE HAD NOT SAT LONG BEFORE HE SAW THREE OF THEM STRIDING TOWARDS HIM
AND LASTED TILL THE APPROACH OF WINTER WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER MOTHER
AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING DROWNED ME BECAUSE NOW I AM ON DRY LAND AND REALLY RICH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS WHEN I WAS IN THE SACK
VERY GOOD SPIRITS YES SAID LITTLE KLAUS MY WIZARD CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT I ASK ISN'T THAT TRUE HE ASKED TREADING ON THE SACK SO THAT IT SQUEAKED
AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
FOR THE ROCKS BY THE SEA WERE SMOOTH AND LEVEL BUT OVERHEAD THERE WERE HIGH CLIFFS IT SEEMED DIFFICULT TO GET UP THESE BUT HE WENT ALONG THE FOOT OF THEM FOR A LITTLE TILL AT LAST HE TRIED TO CLIMB UP WHICH AT LAST HE DID
STORM CAME ON IN WHICH HE LOST HIS WAY
HE WENT ON EATING WITH A STILL GREATER APPETITE AT LAST HE GOT HOLD OF ANOTHER KIND OF CABBAGE BUT SCARCELY HAD SWALLOWED IT WHEN HE FELT ANOTHER CHANGE AND HE ONCE MORE REGAINED HIS HUMAN FORM THE HUNTER NOW LAY DOWN AND SLEPT OFF HIS WEARINESS
HE SHOULD BE HANGED BUT IF IT WAS OTHERWISE THEN RED SHOULD DIE SO THE KING SENT FOR RING AND ASKED HIM FOR WHAT REASON HE HAD DONE THIS SNATI HOWEVER
BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
HE ROSE UP BEFORE DAWN AND WENT OUTSIDE FOR HE THOUGHT HIS HEART WOULD BE LIGHTER IN THE OPEN AIR
BUT PEACE AND ORDER DID NOT COME TO THE HOUSEHOLD FOR THE STEP MOTHER WAS VERY CRUEL TO THE TWINS AND BEAT THEM AND HALF STARVED THEM AND CONSTANTLY DROVE THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR HER ONE IDEA WAS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY
IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REMAIN TOGETHER FOR THE WATER TORE THEM APART AND WHEN THE FLOOD WAS OVER THEY BOTH RESUMED THEIR OWN SHAPES AGAIN
DRAGGED A LOT OF PINE WOOD AND ROPES TO THE SPOT THEY FASTENED SOME OF THE BURNING PINE WOOD TO THE END OF THE ROPE AND LET IT SLOWLY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS AT FIRST IT WAS QUITE DARK
AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
AND GOING UP TO IT HE STRUCK THE GRANDMOTHER ON THE HEAD JUST WHERE HE THOUGHT LITTLE KLAUS WOULD BE THERE SAID HE NOW YOU WON'T GET THE BEST OF ME AGAIN AND HE WENT HOME
IT IS REALLY TOO GOOD HOW PLEASED THE PRINCESS WILL BE WHY SAID THE BROTHERS THIS IS PURE MUD STRAIGHT FROM THE DITCH OF COURSE IT IS SAID BLOCKHEAD HANS AND IT IS THE BEST KIND
WHEN A KNIGHT IN GOLDEN ARMOUR AND MOUNTED ON A SPIRITED STEED WAS SEEN MAKING HIS WAY TOWARDS THE FATAL HILL
AND AS EACH ONE CAME INTO THE ROOM ALL HIS FINE PHRASES WENT OUT LIKE A CANDLE IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID THE PRINCESS AWAY OUT WITH HIM AT LAST SHE CAME TO THE ROW IN WHICH THE BROTHER WHO KNEW THE DICTIONARY BY HEART WAS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW IT ANY LONGER
AND THEY JOURNEYED ON WITH THEIR LITTLE WHIP THEY HAD AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WANTED WORE GRAND CLOTHES AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE WORLD WHEREVER THEY WENT THEY LIVED IN MERRYMAKING AND SPLENDOUR DROVE ABOUT WITH HORSES AND CARRIAGES ATE AND DRANK BUT DID NOTHING WRONG
THE PORRIDGE DID NOT TASTE GOOD TO HIM SO HE TROD UPON HIS SACK AND THE DRY SKIN IN THE SACK SQUEAKED LOUDLY HUSH SAID LITTLE KLAUS
THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
AND HE COULD JUST SEE INTO THE ROOM THERE STOOD A LARGE TABLE SPREAD WITH WINE AND ROAST MEAT AND A BEAUTIFUL FISH THE FARMER'S WIFE AND THE SEXTON SAT AT THE TABLE BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
KEPT POURING BOILING PORRIDGE ON HER WITHOUT STOPPING
THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
AND IF HE GOES HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN THE CLOUDS WILL TAKE HIM AND CARRY HIM OFF TALKING THUS THEY WENT AWAY BUT THE HUNTER HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TALK AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD GONE HE ROSE AND CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT
I HAVE SERVED YOU ALL THESE YEARS AND YOU NEVER GAVE ME SO MUCH AS A HARD CRUST
DO YOU SEE THERE ARE STANDING THREE REPORTERS AND AN OLD EDITOR AND THIS OLD EDITOR IS THE WORST FOR HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
I WILL PAY YOU AS MUCH AS YOU WANT THE MILLER REPLIED WHY NOT WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THEM THEN THE HUNTER SAID THAT TO THE OLD DONKEY WHICH WAS THE WITCH THREE BEATINGS AND ONE MEAL TO THE YOUNGER ONE WHICH WAS THE SERVANT
IF HE WOULD GIVE HER IN RETURN THE YOUNGEST THING IN HIS HOUSE THE MILLER THOUGHT SHE MUST MEAN ONE OF HIS PUPPIES OR KITTENS
BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
WAS TO MOUNT ON HER BROOM AND SET OFF IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN AND AS THE CHILDREN RAN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BROOM SWEEPING THE GROUND CLOSE BEHIND THEM
OF COURSE I AM ROASTING YOUNG CHICKENS TO DAY SAID THE PRINCESS THAT'S GOOD REPLIED BLOCKHEAD HANS THEN CAN I ROAST A CROW WITH THEM WITH THE GREATEST OF PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCESS BUT HAVE YOU ANYTHING YOU CAN ROAST THEM IN
AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
DEAR DEAR THOUGHT HE CAN I BE STUPID I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT AND NOBODY MUST KNOW IT CAN I BE NOT FIT FOR MY OFFICE NO I MUST CERTAINLY NOT SAY THAT I CANNOT SEE THE CLOTH
AND AWAITED THE OLD WITCH'S ARRIVAL AT LAST AS IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARK SHE APPEARED SHE SWOOPED DOWN UPON A BIG APPLE TREE
WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS BIG I SUSPECTED SAID THE KING THAT RING WAS NOT QUITE USELESS
POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
UP ON THE LOWEST SHELF OF THE ROCK THE PRINCE BEGAN TO GET GIDDY BUT UP WENT SNATI ON TO THE SECOND SHELF RING WAS NEARLY SWOONING BY THIS TIME BUT SNATI
I HEARD MOST OF THIS FROM THAT YOUNG DEVIL BILLY THE BOY HE SAW SIR FERDINAND RIDE UP SO HE HID CLOSE BY JUST FOR THE FUN OF HEARING HOW HE GOT ON HE'D SEEN WARRIGAL AND ME RIDE AWAY FRANK DEVIL BANGS OUT SIR FERDINAND WHO'D BEGUN TO GET HIS MONKEY UP
NOT NOW ANYHOW WE'D BEEN LIVING TOO GAY AND FREE A LIFE TO BEGIN WITH THE JUG ALL OVER AGAIN SO WE THOUGHT WE'D MAKE ONE JOB OF IT AND GET RIGHT THROUGH IF WE HAD TO SLEEP FOR A WEEK AFTER IT IT WOULD BE SLOW ENOUGH BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE'D GONE THROUGH LATELY
AND THEY'LL HAVE HIM HERE AND TWENTY BLOOD MARES TO PUT TO HIM BEFORE SEPTEMBER THEY'RE ALL GONE MAD THEY'LL RAISE THE COUNTRY ON US EVERY POLICE TROOPER IN THE COLONY'LL BE AFTER US LIKE A PACK OF DINGOES AFTER AN OLD MAN KANGAROO WHEN THE GROUND'S BOGGY
AND WISH I'D HAD THE SENSE TO VALUE HIS INDEPENDENT STRAIGHT AHEAD NATURE AND THE TRACK IT LED HIM AS HE DESERVED JIM AND I RODE IN FRONT WITH GRACEY BETWEEN US SHE HAD ON A NEAT HABIT AND A BETTER HAT AND GLOVES THAN AILEEN
GOOD BYE CLIFFORD YOU'LL HEAR NEWS OF YOUR FRIEND BEFORE LONG OR I'M MUCH MISTAKEN STOP SIR FERDINAND YOU MUST PARDON ME BUT I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR TONE THE MAN THAT WE KNEW BY THE NAME OF FRANK HAUGHTON MAY BE AS YOU SAY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
WHILE US TWO TOOK OUR HORSES AND RODE OUT WE HADN'T A LONG TIME TO BE IN THE OLD HOLLOW NOW IT HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO US IN TIME OF NEED AND WE WAS SORRY IN A KIND OF WAY TO LEAVE IT
SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FOUND THAT THINGS HAD BEEN MADE HOTTER FOR US THAN EVER SINCE WE FIRST TURNED OUT GO WHERE WE WOULD WE FOUND THE POLICE ALWAYS QUICK ON OUR TRAIL
HE WAS OUT ON HIS OWN HOOK AND IT'S MY BELIEF HE'LL BE TOOK THIS TIME IF HE ISN'T VERY CAREFUL
BUT WHAT'S ONE HORSE TO MAKE SUCH A SHINE ABOUT AH THAT'S THE POINT SAYS POOR OLD JIM IT'S A HORSE WORTH TALKING ABOUT
WE LAUGHED AND DAD GROWLED OUT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE PLUCK ANY ON YE TO TACKLE A BIG TOUCH AGAIN I EXPECT THEY'LL SEND A SUMMONS FOR US NEXT AND GET OLD BILL BARKIS THE BAILIFF AT BARGO TO SERVE IT COME COME GOVERNOR SAYS STARLIGHT NONE OF THAT
WHY SAYS FATHER GETTING UP AND GLARING WITH HIS EYES BECAUSE I WAS A BLIND IGNORANT DOG WHEN I WAS YOUNG AS HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT NOTHING AND KNOWED NOTHING NOT SO MUCH AS HIM THERE POINTING TO CRIB
DON'T BOTHER YOUR HEAD IT AIN'T THE BEST PART OF YOU ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN'T BE HELPED WE'RE NOT THE ONLY HORSES THAT CAN'T BE KEPT ON THE COURSE
THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENED ONE OF THE HORSES WAS BAD TO CATCH AND TOOK A LITTLE TROUBLE IN THE YARD
BUT WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN HIS FACE WAS ALL CHANGED AND HARD LIKE OFF YOU GO HE SAYS WITH HIS OLD VOICE NEXT TIME I WANT EITHER OF YOU I'LL SEND WARRIGAL FOR YOU
AND THEY'LL RUN US DOWN TOO THEY CAN'T BE OFF IT WHATEVER MADE EM THINK OF SUCH A BIG TOUCH AS THAT THAT STARLIGHT'S THE DEVIL I THINK SAID JIM SLOWLY FATHER DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT AT FIRST
AND TO HAND THEM OVER TO THE TREASURER OF THE TURON HOSPITAL WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE SIR FERDINAND AND THE POLICE HAD BEEN DECOYED AWAY PREVIOUSLY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILES BY FALSE INTELLIGENCE AS TO MORAN AND HIS GANG
THEY SEEM TO BE GAME FOR ANYTHING THERE'LL BE A HANGING MATCH IN THE FAMILY IF US BOYS DON'T LOOK OUT THERE'S NO KNOWING SAYS JIM WITH A ROGUISH LOOK IN HIS EYE I DIDN'T THINK THEN HOW NEAR THE TRUTH I WAS BUT IT'S ABOUT A HORSE THIS TIME
THE FAMOUS OUTLAW HAD SHORTLY BEFORE QUITTED THE PLACE HAVING RECEIVED WARNING AND BEEN PROVIDED WITH A FAST HORSE BY HIS SINGULAR RETAINER WARRIGAL A HALF CASTE NATIVE OF THE COLONY WHO IS SAID TO BE DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM AND WHO HAS BEEN SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE TURON
GOOD BYE IN CASE I SAID ANYHOW I'LL WRITE YOU A LINE AND AS I SHOOK HANDS WITH THEM TWO REGULAR TRUMPS IF EVER THERE WERE ANY IN THE WORLD I HAD A KIND OF NOTION I'D NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN HARDLY THINK I SHALL EITHER
WITH TEN THOUSAND MORE SURE TO FOLLOW WITHIN A MONTH THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANY TIME ON ONE OF THE SPURS OF NULLA MOUNTAIN AND THE FINDING OUT OF THE TRACK DOWN TO THE HOLLOW BY SOME ONE OF THE DOZENS OF RAMBLING SHOOTING FISHING DIGGERS WOULD BE AS CERTAIN TO HAPPEN AS THE SUN TO RISE
I WISH YOU'D NEVER DROPPED ACROSS HER AND THAT SHE WASN'T JEANIE'S SISTER BLURTS OUT JIM
LEASTWAYS AS LONG AS A CHAP'S SOUND ON HIS PINS BUT I'LL STICK TO YOU DICK AND WHAT'S MORE I CAN TAKE YOU A SHORT CUT TO THE BRUSH AND WE CAN WAIT IN A GULLY AND SEE THE TRAPS COME UP YOU HAVE A SNACK AND LIE DOWN FOR A BIT I SEEN YOU WERE DONE WHEN YOU CAME UP
IT'S RIGHT ENOUGH IF SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND TO TAKE HIM NO ODDS WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF THERE'S ANY HALF AND HALF FEELING IN HER MIND ABOUT HIM AND SHE'S UNCERTAIN AND DOUBTFUL WHETHER SHE LIKES HIM WELL ENOUGH ALL THIS DOWN ON YOUR KNEES BUSINESS WORKS AGAINST YOU
THEY'LL TAKE THEIR LUCK AS IT COMES LIKE OTHERS GROWLED FATHER WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ISN'T TOO BAD FOR THEM WE WANT ANOTHER HAND OR TWO TO WORK THINGS RIGHT
AND PAID US IN CASH OUT OF HIS SHARE OF THE NOTES
THE HORSE HELD UP HIS HEAD AND SNORTED AS HE CAME ABREAST OF US AND WE SHOWED OUT HE WAS ONE OF THE GRANDEST ANIMALS I'D EVER SEEN AND I AFTERWARDS FOUND HE WAS BETTER THAN HE LOOKED
BUT HE AIN'T CAREFUL ENOUGH TO KEEP DARK AND CLOSE WHEN THE PLAY ISN'T GOOD YOU DRAW ALONG STEADY BY YOURSELF TILL YOU MEET JIM THAT'S MY ADVICE TO YE I MEAN TO DO THAT
WE FOUND A COUPLE OF DOUBLE BARRELLED GUNS AND SHOT DUCKS ENOUGH TO LAST US A WEEK NO WONDER THE OLD FREQUENTERS OF THE HOLLOW USED TO LIVE HERE FOR A MONTH AT A TIME HAVING GREAT TIMES OF IT AS LONG AS THEIR GROG LASTED
SO WHEN ALL CAME TO ALL WE MADE UP OUR MINDS TO LEARN HIM A LESSON TO STICK TO HIS OWN WORK BESIDES A THOUSAND OUNCES OF GOLD WAS NO FOOLISH TOUCH AND WE COULD KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
AND THOUGHT HE AND OLD CRIB COULD BRING THEM IN BY THEMSELVES AND A MIGHTY GOOD HAUL IT WAS FATHER SAID WE SHOULD SHARE THE WEANERS BETWEEN THE THREE OF US THAT MEANT FIFTY POUNDS A PIECE AT LEAST THE DEVIL ALWAYS HELPS BEGINNERS
WELL THE COUNTRY HAD CHANGED AND WE WERE BOUND TO CHANGE WITH IT WE COULDN'T STOP BOXED UP IN THE HOLLOW DAY AFTER DAY AND MONTH AFTER MONTH SHOOTING AND HORSE BREAKING DOING NOTHING AND EARNING NOTHING IF WE WENT OUTSIDE THERE WERE TEN TIMES MORE MEN LOOKING OUT FOR US THAN EVER
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT SIR FERDINAND MORRINGER PROMPTLY ARRANGED FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF THREE PARTIES OF POLICE WITH THE HOPE OF CAPTURING ALL THREE OUTLAWS BUT IN TWO CASES THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN STARLIGHT'S
WITH HIS OLD MUSKET OR A PAIR OF PISTOLS
STRONGER THAN EVER I WAS SURPRISED AT MYSELF AND LOOKED QUEER I DARESAY THEN AILEEN LAUGHED AND JIM COMES TO THE RESCUE AND SAYS DICK DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU GRACEY YOU'VE GROWN SUCH A SWELL TOO
AND WE HADN'T MADE UP OUR MIND WHAT OUR LINE WAS TO BE ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE MORE ROW MADE ABOUT US THAN EVER
AND THEM AS COME FROM EM BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE TAKES ITS PLACE BETWEEN THE MAN THAT'S GOT THE ARMS AND THE MAN THAT'S GOT THE MONEY AFTER WE'D TURNED OUT THE COWS WE PUT THE MILK INTO THE LITTLE DAIRY
AND MANAGED TO DISPOSE OF THE HANDCUFFS JIM'S FACE BEGAN TO LOOK MORE CHEERFUL BUT HE WAS DOWN IN THE MOUTH AGAIN WHEN HE SAW THE WOUNDED MAN HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DO ALL HE COULD FOR HIM WE STOPPED A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND THE BRUSH WHICH HAD ALREADY HELPED US WELL
THOUGH WE HADN'T HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
I FEEL AS SURE AS WE'RE STANDING HERE IT'S ALL A TOSS UP LIKE OUR LIVES MARRIED OR LAGGED BUSHWORK OR ROADWORK IN IRONS FREE OR BOND WE CAN'T TELL HOW IT WILL BE WITH US THIS DAY YEAR
THE NEXT MORNING JIM AND I STARTED OFF HOME FATHER SAID HE SHOULD STAY IN THE HOLLOW TILL STARLIGHT GOT ROUND A BIT HE TOLD US NOT TO TELL MOTHER OR AILIE A WORD ABOUT WHERE WE'D BEEN OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T BE OFF KNOWIN THAT WE'D BEEN WITH HIM
WHAT WAS HE LIKE SLIGHT DARK MAN YOUNGISH GOOD LOOKING WARRIGAL THE HALF CASTE BY GEORGE WARRANTS OUT FOR HIM ALSO SAYS SIR FERDINAND ON A GOOD HORSE OF COURSE WITH AN HOUR'S START WE MAY GIVE UP THE IDEA OF CATCHING HIM THIS TIME
GOOD TEMPERED TOO AND THE OLD HORSE HAS TAKEN UP WITH HER IT WILL BE COMPANY FOR HIM
AFTER RIDING TWENTY MILES THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW WHEN BILLY POINTED TO A TRAIL WHICH CAME BROAD WAYS ACROSS THE ROAD AND WHICH THEN FOLLOWED IT HERE THEY ARE P'LEECE AND NO MISTAKE
AS THEY STEPPED ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ROUND MISSUS KNIGHTLEY SMILED SHE LOOKED TO ME LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THAT HAD COME BY CHANCE INTO THE OTHER PLACE AND HADN'T FOUND OUT HER MISTAKE I SAW STARLIGHT START AS HE LOOKED AT HER
BY MAKING A GREAT PUSH THE FIRST DAY OR TWO AND AS THE POLICE WOULD BE THROWN OFF THE SCENT IN A WAY WE SETTLED AND A GOOD DODGE IT WAS WE SHOULD HAVE ALL THE MORE TIME TO BE CLEAR OF NEW SOUTH WALES BEFORE THEY REGULARLY DROPPED THAT WE WERE GIVING THEM LEG BAIL FOR IT
WHAT ABOUT JIM WHY THE P'LEECE GRABBED HIM OF COURSE YOU FELLERS DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING ON FOR EVER AND EVER KEEPIN THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF TERRORISM AS THE PAPERS SAY NO DICK IT'S WRONG AND WICKED AND SINFUL YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOCK UNDER AND GIVE US YOUNG UNS A CHANCE
WE RODE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THERE WAS A KIND OF GULLY THAT CAME IN SOMETHING LIKE THE ONE WE CAME IN BY
RODE POOR OLD JIM LOOKING AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BE HANGED THAT DAY AS BILLY SAID THOUGH I KNEW WELL HE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE JIM EVER LOOKED MISERABLE FOR SO LONG SINCE HE WAS BORN WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
HE GAVE HIM A GOOD ROWING AND TOLD HIM HE DESERVED ANOTHER HAMMERING WHICH HE HAD A GOOD MIND TO GIVE HIM IF WE HADN'T BEEN STARTING FOR A JOURNEY WARRIGAL DIDN'T SAY A WORD TO HIM HE NEVER DID STARLIGHT TOLD ME ON THE QUIET THOUGH HE WAS SORRY IT HAPPENED
IT LOOKED AS IF OUR LUCK WAS DEAD OUT AND WE BEGAN TO THINK OUR CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER TO QUEENSLAND AND CLEAR OUT OF THE COLONY THAT WAY LOOKED WORSE EVERY DAY DAD KEPT FORAGING ABOUT TO GET INFORMATION
HOW DO YOU THINK HE LIKES IT WHAT BUSINESS THAT OF YOURS HE SAID YOU MIND YOUR WORK AND I'LL MIND MINE THIS IS THE WORST DAY'S WORK YOU'VE DONE THIS YEAR AND SO I TELL YOU
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS I OWE IT YOU AND JIM ONE A PIECE CONFOUND YOU I SAID IT'S ALL YOUR OWN FAULT WHY COULDN'T YOU STOP ILL USING THE HORSE YOU DON'T LIKE BEING HIT YOURSELF
I'D MADE A BIT OF A BARGAIN WITH JONATHAN WHO SOLD ME A PAIR OF RIDING BOOTS BUTCHER'S AND A BIG TWEED PONCHO THE BOOTS WERE EASIER TO TAKE A LONG ROUGH RIDE IN THAN TROUSERS AND I WANTED THE PONCHO TO KEEP THE BALLARD RIFLE UNDER IT WOULDN'T DO TO HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND ALL THE TIME
HE WAS TO MEET HIM AT THE HOLLOW ON PURPOSE TO HELP HIM OUT WITH THE MOB OF FAT BULLOCKS WE HAD LOOKED AT FATHER IT APPEARS WAS COMING HERE BY HIMSELF WHEN HE MET THIS OUTLYING LOT OF MISTER HUNTER'S CATTLE
WE STAYED IN THERE BY THE TRACK AND AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE HEARD THE TWO HORSES COMING DOWN SLOWLY STEP BY STEP KICKING THE STONES DOWN BEFORE THEM THEN WE COULD HEAR A MAN GROANING AS IF HE COULDN'T BEAR THE PAIN
STARLIGHT WAS TO RIDE RAINBOW OF COURSE AND HE HAD GREAT PICKING BEFORE HE MADE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO CHOOSE FOR SECOND HORSE AT LAST HE PITCHED UPON A THOROUGHBRED BAY MARE NAMED LOCKET
AND WERE BEGINNING TO GET RATHER SICK OF THE LIFE WHEN FATHER WHO USED ALWAYS TO BE LOOKING AT A BARE PATCH IN THE SCRUB ABOVE US SAID THEY'RE COMING AT LAST WHO ARE COMING FRIENDS WHY FRIENDS OF COURSE THAT'S STARLIGHT'S SIGNAL
WE HAD BREAKFAST PRETTY COMFORTABLE AND CHEERFUL MOTHER LOOKED PLEASED AND GLAD TO SEE ME ONCE MORE AND AILEEN HAD GOT ON HER OLD FACE AGAIN AND WAS PARTLY COME ROUND TO HER OLD WAYS
CHAPTER FIFTEEN GEORGE STOREFIELD'S PLACE FOR THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD AND ALL THE PLACE BELONGED TO HIM AND GRACEY QUITE STUNNED JIM AND ME WE'D BEEN AWAY MORE THAN A YEAR AND HE'D PULLED DOWN THE OLD FENCES AND PUT UP NEW ONES
THE HORSES OF COURSE WERE SPARE ONES AND NOT WANTED AGAIN FOR A BIT NEXT MORNING IT WAS SHARP'S THE WORD AND NO MISTAKE I FELT A DEAL SMARTER ON IT THAN YESTERDAY
THAT'S SAYING A GREAT DEAL JUST THEN MORAN AND WALL MANAGED TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND THEY CAME TEARING INTO THE HALL LIKE A PAIR OF COLTS THEY LOOKED RATHER QUEER WHEN THEY SAW US THREE AND NO ONE ELSE
NOW SAYS HE WE MUST MAKE OUR LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS I SHALL BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT CUNNAMULLA BY THE END OF THIS MONTH IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST WEEK
TILL WE CAME TO OUR HORSES THEN WE ALL RODE OFF TOGETHER
GOOD AS ANYTHING ENGLAND COULD TURN OUT I SAY AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HORSE FLESH PART OF IT THE FUN AND HARD RIDING AND TRACKING AND ALL THE REST OF IT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING LIKE THE CROSS WORK THAT THERE IS IN AUSTRALIA IT LIES PARTLY BETWEEN THAT AND THE DRY WEATHER
THEN MISTER KNIGHTLEY BEGAN AGAIN HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE STOOD HE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF MORAN AND WALL THEY WERE A DEAL TOO QUIET FOR HIM AND HE COULD READ MEN'S FACES LIKE A BOOK
TEN TIMES MORE CHANCE OF OUR BEING TRACKED OR RUN DOWN THAN EVER THAT WE KNEW FROM THE NEWSPAPERS HOW DID WE SEE THEM OH THE OLD WAY WE SENT OUT OUR SCOUT WARRIGAL
IF HE SAW HIS WAY WITHOUT HURTING STARLIGHT HE CAN'T DO IT SAYS DAD IT'S SINK OR SWIM WITH THE LOT OF YOU AND HE DURSN'T EITHER NOT HE SAYS FATHER BEGINNING TO GROWL OUT HIS WORDS
AND I CAN'T LEAVE HIM BEHIND CAN I I'LL SHIP HIM IF I CAN THAT'S MORE BUT IT WON'T MATTER MUCH FOR WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE BACK TRACKS ALL THE WAY YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE WE WERE TO RIDE ALONG THE MAIL ROAD DID YOU
FOR JAMES MARSTON WHO WAS MARRIED BUT A SHORT WHILE SINCE TO A MELBOURNE YOUNG LADY OF HIGH PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AND THE MOST WINNING AMIABILITY GREAT SYMPATHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY ALL CLASSES SO MUCH FOR THE STAR
OH WE DO DO WE SAID THE STRANGER FIXING HIS EYES ON FATHER AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BURN A HOLE IN HIM WITH A BURNING GLASS
JIM WAS TO GET ON TO ONE OF THE MURRAY RIVER BOATS AT SWAN HILL AND STICK TO HER TILL HE GOT A CHANCE TO GO UP THE DARLING WITH AN ADELAIDE BOAT TO BOURKE
AND MANY ANOTHER CURRENCY CHAP CAN SAY THE SAME
WE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR A FEW DAYS YOU MAY BE SURE
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THEY'D MAKE YOU A BEAK IF YOU'D STAYED THERE LONG ENOUGH I'M AFRAID DICK'S DROPPING THE POLICEMAN WON'T ADD TO OUR POPULARITY THOUGH HE'S ALL RIGHT I SAID HURRAH LOOK HERE I'M GLAD I DIDN'T FINISH THE POOR BEGGAR LISTEN TO THIS FROM THE TURON BANNER
THEN STARLIGHT COME TO HIS SENSES AND WE CLEAR MY WORD HE COULDN'T SEE THE WAY THE OLD HORSE WENT HA HA HERE THE YOUNG DEVIL LAUGHED TILL THE TREES AND ROCKS RANG AGAIN GALLOP DIFFERENT WAYS TOO AND MET AT THE OLD NEEDLE ROCK
AND I RUSHED AT HIM I BELIEVE HE'D HAVE KILLED ME THAT MINUTE IF HE'D HAD THE CHANCE AND HE MADE A DEUCED GOOD OFFER AT IT
I'VE KNOWN CHAPS TO GO A DEUCE OF A WAY ONCE THEY GOT ON THE TRACK AND THERE'S GETTING SOME SMART FELLOWS AMONG EM NOW
JUST THEN THE LEADING HORSE CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN BEFORE THE CAVE WE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT HIM AND HIS RIDER I NEVER FORGOT THEM IT WAS A BAD DAY I EVER SAW EITHER AND MANY A MAN HAD CAUSE TO SAY THE SAME
AND WENT ON WITH MY PACKING AND GETTING READY FOR THE ROAD WE FIXED UP TO START ON THE MONDAY AND GET AS FAR AWAY THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AS WE COULD MANAGE WE EXPECTED TO GET A GOOD START
WE WASHED IT AND RELIEVED THE WOUNDED MAN BY DISCOVERING THAT THE OTHER BULLET HAD ONLY BEEN SPENT AFTER STRIKING A TREE MOST LIKE WHEN IT HAD KNOCKED THE WIND OUT OF HIM AND NEARLY UNHORSED HIM AS WARRIGAL SAID FILL MY PIPE ONE OF YOU
NOT A BAD PLACE FOR SHEEP AND CATTLE AND BLACKS SAID POOR GEORGE LOOKING RATHER GLUM AND NOT A BAD COUNTRY TO MAKE MONEY OR DO ANYTHING BUT LIVE IN
DASHED IF I AIN'T SEEN SOME PARSONS THAT COULD GIVE YOU ODDS AND WALK ROUND YE AT HORSE DEALIN YOU TAKE YOUR OWN WAY BEN AND I'LL TAKE MINE SAYS STARLIGHT RATHER FIERCE AND THEN FATHER LEFT OFF AND WENT TO DO SOMETHING OR OTHER
AND VERY TRUE TOO LAST SUNDAY THEN THE YOUNGSTERS HAVIN SO MUCH IDLE TIME ON THEIR HANDS TAKE TO GAFFIN AND FLASH TALK AND MONEY MUST BE GOT TO SPORT AND PAY UP IF THEY LOSE AND THE STOCK ALL RAMBLIN ABOUT AND MIXED UP
AS ANY OF US THAT HAD GOT CLEAN AWAY TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND LIVED SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH DIDN'T DIE SO SOON EITHER LIVED TO A GOOD ROUND AGE AND HAD WIVES AND CHILDREN ROUND THEM THAT NEVER KNEW BUT WHAT THEY'D BEEN AS GOOD AS THE BEST
WITH A GRAND BLACK BEARD THAT CAME DOWN TO HIS CHEST HE WALKED LIKE A LORD AND HAD THAT KIND OF MANNER WITH HIM THAT COMES TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN USED TO BE WAITED ON AND HAVE EVERYTHING FOUND FOR THEM IN THIS WORLD AS FOR HIS WIFE
BUSH RANGING REVIVED THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PASSED AWAY FOR EVER WHEN MAIL ROBBERIES AND HAND TO HAND CONFLICTS WITH ARMED ROBBERS WERE MATTERS OF WEEKLY OCCURRENCE
SIR FERDINAND WAS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE BUT WE KNEW HE COULDN'T DO IT ALL HIMSELF UNLESS HE GOT THE OFFICE FROM SOME ONE WHO KNEW THE ROPES BETTER THAN HE DID LAST OF ALL WE DROPPED ON TO IT THERE WAS ONE OF THE GOLDFIELDS COMMISSIONERS
WHILE WE SNEAKED UP WE COULDN'T GET NEAR THOUGH WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT FOR HE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF SPORTING DOGS
HE WILL APPEAR ON THE JUDGMENT DAY LEADING RAINBOW I FIRMLY BELIEVE WHY HE SHOULD BE SO CONFOUNDEDLY ANXIOUS ABOUT MY WELFARE I CAN'T MAKE OUT I CAN'T REALLY IT'S HIS PECULIAR FORM OF MANIA I SUPPOSE WE ALL SUFFER FROM SOME MADNESS OR OTHER
A HALF CASTE NAMED WARRIGAL HAD BEEN OBSERVED ON THE FIELD THE DAY BEFORE BY HIM HE WAS DOUBTLESS FURNISHED WITH A WARNING AND THE HORSE UPON WHICH HE LEFT HIS ABODE SHORTLY BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF SIR FERDINAND
IF HE COULD HAVE BEGUN AGAIN AND THOUGHT OF WHAT MISERY HE WAS GOING TO BRING ON THE LOT OF US HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE ON THE CROSS IT WAS TOO LATE TOO LATE NOW THOUGH TO THINK OF THAT TOWARDS MORNING I HEARD THE OLD DOG GROWL
OR ELSE PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT INTO THE TURON STAR THAT STARLIGHT MARSTON AND CO ARE GIVING UP BUSINESS AND GOING TO LEAVE THE DISTRICT ALL ACCOUNTS OWING TO BE SENT IN BY A CERTAIN DATE A FIRST RATE IDEA SAYS HE
HERE'S THE PRISONER'S HORSE SEE HOW HE STUMBLED AND THIS ROAD THEY'RE BOUND TO GO TILL THEY CROSS THE STONY POINT AND GET INTO BARGO BRUSH NEAR A CREEK
MY WORD HE VERY NEARLY FALL OFF JUST LIKE THAT HERE HE IMITATED A MAN REELING IN HIS SADDLE BUT THE OLD HORSE STOP STEADY WITH HIM MY WORD TILL HE COME TO THEN THE SERGEANT FIRE AT HIM AGAIN HIT HIM IN THE SHOULDER WITH HIS PISTOL
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US
IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
THAT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF THAT RUMOUR HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES HAD CHANGED THEIR MINDS I USED TO LOOK AT MY MASTER'S FACE TO SEE IF IT WERE SAD OR FIERCE
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH TRUANT TRUANT HE ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
AND SHE ADDED I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES AND DISCREET CONDUCT THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING WITH SUCH AN ONE AS YOU AND WITH GEORGIANA
HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE ORCHARD
SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MISTER GIBSON
THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
DIANA OFFERED TO TEACH ME GERMAN I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED ME NO LESS
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE INSULT WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED I WAS READING SHOW THE BOOK I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
A DEPENDENT DOES HER DUTY AS WELL AS YOU HAVE DONE YOURS
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
AND HIMSELF IT IS A LONG WAY TO IRELAND JANET AND I AM SORRY TO SEND MY LITTLE FRIEND ON SUCH WEARY TRAVELS BUT IF I CAN'T DO BETTER
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
THEN I MUST GO YOU HAVE SAID IT YOURSELF NO YOU MUST STAY I SWEAR IT AND THE OATH SHALL BE KEPT
PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT NOT BETRAY ME
I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD EXPOSTULATE HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN CHEERFUL
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY LOVED IT IS A LONG WAY I AGAIN SAID
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT I SHALL TAKE UP MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
WEARY WITH GATHERING WILD STRAWBERRIES IN HAY LANE HALF THE DAY HAD GONE TO BED WITH THE SUN I WATCHED HER DROP ASLEEP AND WHEN I LEFT HER I SOUGHT THE GARDEN IT WAS NOW
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER
STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED THE HEART WAS THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE SOFTENED THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS
EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON
I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
YOU'RE NOT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO LOOK AFTER MORE MOTHS ARE YOU THAT WAS ONLY A LADY CLOCK CHILD FLYING AWAY HOME
YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
NOTHING TO YOU DO YOU THINK I AM AN AUTOMATON
THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
IN LISTENING I SOBBED CONVULSIVELY FOR I COULD REPRESS WHAT I ENDURED NO LONGER I WAS OBLIGED TO YIELD AND I WAS SHAKEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH ACUTE DISTRESS
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED IN IT A FULL AND DELIGHTFUL LIFE MOMENTARILY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN TRAMPLED ON I HAVE NOT BEEN PETRIFIED
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW GRANITE CRAG THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A
THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED VAPOUR
MYSELF LOOK OUT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AN ASYLUM FOR YOU THANK YOU SIR I AM SORRY TO GIVE OH
CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND ONE MORNING BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE WINDOW RECESS
THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN
AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT SADLY FAILS ME IN FRAMING AN EXCUSE AND ALWAYS THE LAPSE OCCURS AT SOME CRISIS
AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MISTER ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
HOW IS IT TO BE HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL BECAUSE HE SAID
MISSUS FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS LEAH SMILED AND EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
IN A FEW DAYS I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED MY HEALTH THAT I COULD SIT UP ALL DAY AND WALK OUT SOMETIMES I COULD JOIN WITH DIANA AND MARY IN ALL THEIR OCCUPATIONS CONVERSE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WISHED
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
NO WEATHER SEEMED TO HINDER HIM IN THESE PASTORAL EXCURSIONS RAIN OR FAIR HE WOULD WHEN HIS HOURS OF MORNING STUDY WERE OVER TAKE HIS HAT AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER'S OLD POINTER CARLO GO OUT ON HIS MISSION OF LOVE OR DUTY
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
WHEN I HEARD HIM PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME
TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
WHAT BRIDE I HAVE NO BRIDE BUT YOU WILL HAVE YES I WILL I WILL HE SET HIS TEETH
AND FOUND THAT IT FITTED PERFECTLY TO HIS GRASP AS HE RAISED THE POINT TO REST HIS OPPONENT TOOK HIS STATION AT THE FARTHER EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS AND AGAIN THERE WAS A LITTLE SPACE OF BREATHLESS PAUSE
HE HAD QUITTED THE LOW NARROW WHITE WALLED FARMHOUSE FOR THE CASTLE OF THE GREAT EARL OF MACKWORTH HE HAD NEVER APPRECIATED BEFORE HOW LOW AND NARROW AND POOR THE FARM HOUSE WAS NOW WITH HIS EYES TRAINED TO THE BIGNESS OF DEVLEN CASTLE
HE SAW THE MAIL CLAD FIGURE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE LISTS RUSHING TOWARDS HIM LOOMING LARGER AND LARGER AS THEY CAME TOGETHER
WERE NOW AIDING THE FALLEN KNIGHT TO ARISE THE SENIOR SQUIRE DREW HIS DAGGER CUT THE LEATHER POINTS AND DREW OFF THE HELM DISCLOSING THE KNIGHT'S FACE A FACE WHITE AS DEATH
HE HATH PROMISED TO TAKE THEE INTO HIS SERVICE UNTIL THE FITTING TIME COMES TO BRING THEE AND THINE ENEMY TOGETHER AND TO MORROW I SHALL TAKE THEE TO SCOTLAND YARD WHERE HIS HIGHNESS IS NOW LODGING AS THE EARL ENDED HIS SPEECH MYLES BOWED BUT DID NOT SPEAK THE EARL WAITED FOR A LITTLE WHILE
THOU DOST BRING HONOR TO ME FOR I TELL THEE TRULY THOU DOST RIDE LIKE A KNIGHT SEASONED IN TWENTY TOURNEYS
BEARING HIS SHIELD AND HELMET GASCOYNE HAD PICKED UP MYLES'S FALLEN HELMET AS THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE MOVED AWAY AND LORD GEORGE AND SIR JAMES LEE
WHAT THOU SAYEST DOTH REJOICE MY VERY HEART
IT IS A STRANGE SEEMING PLACE FROM WITHOUT SAID HE AT LAST AND MAYHAP IT MAY BE EVEN MORE STRANGE INSIDE HAST EVER BEEN WITHIN FRANCIS NAY SAID GASCOYNE
VENGEANCE WAS READY TO FALL UPON HIS FATHER AT ANY MOMENT AND IT NEEDED ONLY SUCH A PRETEXT AS THAT OF SHELTERING SO PROMINENT A CONSPIRATOR AS SIR JOHN TO COMPLETE HIS RUIN
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SMALL TRIANGULAR PASSAGE WAY FROM WHICH A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LED DOWN THROUGH A HOLLOW IN THE MASSIVE WALL TO THE ROOM BELOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS WAS A HEAVY OAKEN DOOR WHICH STOOD AJAR
AS HE TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS HIS OWN END OF THE LISTS HE SAW THE OTHER TROTTING SLOWLY BACK TOWARDS HIS STATION ALSO HOLDING A BROKEN SPEAR SHAFT IN HIS HAND AS HE PASSED THE IRON FIGURE A VOICE ISSUED FROM THE HELMET
HE WILL NOT DARE TO TOUCH ME TO HARM ME I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SPEAK THE FULL FEELINGS OF HIS HEART I KNOW NOT MYLES SAID GASCOYNE SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
AN I HAD LIVED HERE IN THIS PLACE SO LONG AS THOU I WOT I WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN IT ERE THIS BESHREW ME SAID GASCOYNE BUT I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A MATTER HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT THE TALL CROWN RISING INTO THE WARM SUNLIGHT WITH A NEW INTEREST
LEARNED IN HIS PAGEHOOD SERVICE AS ATTENDANT UPON THE COUNTESS AND HER LADIES IN OTHER THINGS ALSO THE CHARACTER AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ONE LAD HELPED TO SUPPLY WHAT WAS LACKING IN THE OTHER
NAY SAID MYLES BRIEFLY PERHAPS THIS TALK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAD EVER PASSED BETWEEN THEM
WHO HATH SO RUINED MY FATHER IN BODY AND FORTUNE NAY SAID PRIOR EDWARD THOUGHTFULLY
HIS WAS A BROODING NATURE AND IN THE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS THAT PASSED HE HAD MEDITATED SO MUCH OVER WHAT HAD BEEN TOLD HIM THAT BY AND BY IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF A SHADOW OF SHAME RESTED UPON HIS FATHER'S FAIR FAME
WHO IN ALL HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN A LADY YOUNG OR OLD EXCEPTING HIS MOTHER WAS NEVER TIRED OF LYING SILENTLY LISTENING TO GASCOYNE'S CHATTER OF THE GAY DOINGS OF THE CASTLE GENTLE LIFE IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN PART SO OFTEN IN THE MERRY DAYS OF HIS PAGEHOOD
AND BEFRIEND ME AND MY FATHER OPENLY EVEN IF IT BE TO HIS OWN PERIL SAID MYLES REVERTING STUBBORNLY TO WHAT HE HAD FIRST SPOKEN GASCOYNE DID NOT ANSWER BUT LAY FOR A LONG WHILE IN SILENCE
THE EARL HATH MANY ENEMIES AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE HATH STOOD MORE THAN ONCE IN PERIL HAVING BEEN ACCUSED OF DEALINGS WITH THE KING'S FOES HE WAS COUSIN TO THE EARL OF KENT
THEY WERE PRESENTLY SEATED SNUGLY IN THE IVIED NICHE IN THE WINDOW IT WAS BARRED FROM WITHIN BY A CRUMBLING SHUTTER THE RUSTY FASTENING OF WHICH AFTER SOME LITTLE EFFORT UPON THE PART OF THE TWO GAVE WAY AND ENTERING THE NARROW OPENING
WHEN IN THE JOUSTING MATCH BETWEEN REYNAND DE ROYE AND JOHN DE HOLLAND THE SIEUR REYNAND LEFT EVERY POINT OF HIS HELM LOOSENED SO THAT THE HELM WAS BEATEN OFF AT EACH STROKE IF HE THEN WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO OF HIS OWN CHOICE AND WILFULLY SUFFERING TO BE UNHELMED
IT WAS ALL LIKE A PUPPETSHOW OF REAL LIFE EACH ACTING UNCONSCIOUSLY A PART IN THE PLAY THE COOL WIND CAME IN THROUGH THE RUSTLING LEAVES AND FANNED THEIR CHEEKS HOT WITH THE CLIMB UP THE WINDING STAIR WAY
THE EARL OF MACKWORTH STROKED HIS BEARD SOFTLY THOU ART MARVELLOUS CHANGED SAID HE
WHY SHOULD HE BE AFEARED TO BEFRIEND THEE WHO ART THOU THAT THE EARL SHOULD FEAR THEE MYLES HESITATED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WISDOM BADE HIM REMAIN SILENT UPON THE DANGEROUS TOPIC
ONE EVENING THE BACHELORS WERE MORE THAN USUALLY NOISY IN THEIR END OF THE DORMITORY LAUGHING AND TALKING AND SHOUTING TO ONE ANOTHER HOLLOA YOU SIRRAH FALWORTH CALLED ONE OF THEM ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM BLUNT COMETH AGAIN TO MORROW DAY
THE OTHER LADS WERE SOMETIMES OCCUPIED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WHEN SPORTS WERE AFOOT IN WHICH THEY WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TAKEN PART MYLES WAS ALWAYS FREE TO ENTER INTO ANY MATTER OF THE KIND AFTER HIS DAILY EXERCISE HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT THE PELS THE BUTTS OR THE TILTING COURT
THERE BE MORE REASONS THAN THOU WOTTEST OF WHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DEALINGS WITH THY FATHER I HAD NOT THOUGHT SAID MYLES BITTERLY AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE THAT THOU WOULDST STAND UP FOR HIM AND AGAINST ME IN THIS QUARREL GASCOYNE
AN THOU STOP NOT THINE OUTCRY I WILL CUT THY THROAT FOR THEE AND HE MADE A FEROCIOUS GESTURE WITH HIS DAGGER IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO WORM THE STORY FROM THE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MONKEY HE KNEW MYLES TOO WELL TO BE IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF HIS THREATS
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKED UPON THE SCHEME AT ALL IN THE LIGHT OF REAL UTILITY BUT I THINK THAT EVEN WITH HIM THE FUN OF THE MATTER OUTWEIGHED THE SERIOUS PART OF THE BUSINESS SO IT WAS THAT THE SACRED ORDER OF THE TWENTY KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE CAME TO BE INITIATED
AFTER A GAME OR TWO OF DRAUGHTS THE YOUNG KNIGHT TALKED MORE FREELY AND OPENLY OF HIS PLANS HIS HOPES HIS AMBITIONS THAN PERHAPS HE HAD EVER DONE
PERHAPS TEN OR TWELVE FEET AND IT WAS BESIDES BEYOND THE EAVES AND OUT OF THEIR REACH MYLES LOOKED UP AND LOOKED DOWN ABOVE WAS THE BUSHY THICKNESS OF THE IVY THE BRANCHES AS THICK AS A WOMAN'S WRIST
FOR AS I HAVE SAID MYLES FELT EASIER NOW THAT HE HAD POURED OUT HIS BITTER THOUGHTS AND WORDS AND AS FOR GASCOYNE
WAR AND BLOODSHED SEEM HARD AND CRUEL MATTERS TO ME BUT GOD HATH GIVEN THAT THEY BE IN THE WORLD AND MAY HE FORBID THAT SUCH A POOR WORM AS I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY BE ALL WRONG AND EVIL
BROKEN PIECES THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT FROM THE WINDOW BEHIND SIR MYLES SAID THE EARL SUDDENLY BREAKING THE SILENCE AT LAST DOST THOU KNOW WHY I SENT FOR THEE HITHER AYE SAID MYLES CALMLY HOW CAN I ELSE
BUT THE OLD TOWER SERVED ANOTHER PURPOSE THAN THAT OF A SPOT IN WHICH TO PASS AWAY A FEW IDLE HOURS OR IN WHICH TO INDULGE THE CONFIDENCES OF FRIENDSHIP FOR IT WAS THERE THAT MYLES GATHERED A BACKING OF STRENGTH FOR RESISTANCE AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THE BACHELORS
WHICH WAS WHERE SOLID PERHAPS FIFTEEN FEET THICK FROM THE THIRD FLOOR A STRAIGHT FLIGHT OF STEPS LED UPWARD TO A CLOSED DOOR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF WHICH SHONE THE DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS OF SUNLIGHT AND WHENCE CAME A STRANGE NOISE
DID I BELIEVE THY FATHER A TRAITOR THINKEST THOU I WOULD THUS TELL HIS SON THEREOF NAY MYLES
FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
THE STORY GOETH THAT EARL ROBERT'S BROTHER OR STEP BROTHER WAS MURDERED THERE AND SOME MEN SAY BY THE EARL HIMSELF SIN THAT DAY IT HATH BEEN TIGHT SHUT MYLES STARED AT THE TOWER FOR A WHILE IN SILENCE
WHEN THEY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THAT HALF YEAR WHICH THE YOUNG SOLDIER HAD SPENT IN FRANCE TO MYLES IT SEEMED SOMEHOW VERY STRANGE THAT HIS LORDSHIP'S FAMILIAR FACE AND FIGURE SHOULD LOOK SO EXACTLY THE SAME TO LORD MACKWORTH PERHAPS
THEY APPOINTED A CODE OF SECRET PASSWORDS AND COUNTERSIGNS WHICH WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER AND WHICH WERE ONLY USED WHEN THEY MIGHT EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF THE OTHER AND UNINITIATED BOYS BY THEIR MYSTERIOUS SOUND
NOW AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE COURT AND ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET DISTANT FROM THE GARDEN WALL THERE GREW A PEAR TREE SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH OVERHUNG INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND SO FIRST MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE WAS LOOKING THAT WAY
AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE PROPORTIONATELY UPLIFTED THE DAY THAT BLUNT MET HIS FALL
HIM WILL I NEVER FORGIVE SO LONG AS I MAY LIVE AND I HAD THOUGHT THAT THOU WOULDST HAVE STOOD BY ME
AND THAT THOUGH HE WAS THEN LIVING IN THE RETIREMENT OF PRIVATE LIFE HE BITTERLY AND STEADFASTLY OPPOSED KING RICHARD'S ABDICATION
AND WILL CAUSE ME TO COME TO GRIEF SOME OF THESE FINE DAYS NE'THELESS AN THOU BE JACK FOOL AND LEAD THE WAY GO AND I WILL BE TOM FOOL AND FOLLOW ANON IF THY NECK IS WORTH SO LITTLE MINE IS WORTH NO MORE
AND I WILL STRIVE TO ENCOUNTER THEE AS BEST I MAY AND PARDON ME IF I SEEM FORWARD IN SO SAYING BUT WERE I IN THY PLACE MY LORD I WOULD CHANGE ME YON BREAST PIECE AND OVER GIRTH OF MY SADDLE THEY ARE SPRUNG IN THE STITCHES NAY
WERE SOME LITTLE WHAT BURST AND WARNED HIM THEREOF BEFORE WE RAN THIS COURSE
LADY ALICE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH'S NIECE AND WARD A GREAT HEIRESS IN HER OWN RIGHT A STRIKINGLY PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THESE COMPOSED THE EARL'S PERSONAL FAMILY
AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
EVEN MYLES STOPPED IN HIS SPEECH FOR A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED WITH A BEATING HEART AND A CARELESSNESS OF MANNER THAT WAS ALTOGETHER ASSUMED IN HIS HAND BLUNT CARRIED THE HOUSE ORDERS FOR THE DAY AND WITHOUT SEEMING TO NOTICE MYLES HE OPENED IT AND READ THE LIST OF THOSE CALLED UPON FOR HOUSEHOLD SERVICE
THE BOYS PUSHED ASIDE THE TRAILING TENDRILS AND LOOKED OUT AND DOWN THE WHOLE CASTLE LAY SPREAD BELOW THEM
AS MYLES TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE SOUTH END OF THE LISTS HE FOUND THE SIEUR DE LA MONTAIGNE ALREADY AT HIS STATION THROUGH THE PEEP HOLE IN THE FACE OF THE HUGE HELMET A TRANSVERSE SLIT KNOWN AS THE OCCULARIUM HE COULD SEE LIKE A STRANGE NARROW PICTURE
AND ALL THE CASTLE FOLK WERE FED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS OXEN AND SHEEP WERE ROASTED WHOLE HUGE SUET PUDDINGS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND STUFFED WITH PLUMS WERE BOILED IN GREAT CALDRONS IN THE OPEN COURTYARD
BUT MYLES'S MIND WAS DETERMINED HIS ACTIVE SPIRIT COULD NOT BROOK RESTING PASSIVELY UNDER A WRONG HE WOULD ENDURE NO LONGER
AND HIS RIDERLESS HORSE WAS TROTTING AIMLESSLY ABOUT AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LISTS MYLES SAW THE TWO SQUIRES OF THE FALLEN KNIGHT RUN ACROSS TO WHERE THEIR MASTER LAY HE SAW THE LADIES WAVING THEIR KERCHIEFS AND VEILS
AND HAVING ONCE ASSENTED TO IT ENTERED INTO THE SCHEME HEART AND SOUL THREE OTHER LADS ONE OF THEM THAT TALL THIN SQUIRE EDMUND WILKES BEFORE SPOKEN OF WERE SOUNDED UPON THE SUBJECT THEY ALSO ENTERED INTO THE PLAN OF THE SECRET ORGANIZATION
AND BIDDING THE OTHERS KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT MYLES SHINNED UP THIS TREE AND CHOOSING ONE OF THE THICKER LIMBS CLIMBED OUT UPON IT FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THEN LOWERING HIS BODY HE HUNG AT ARM'S LENGTH THE BRANCH BENDING WITH HIS WEIGHT AND SLOWLY LET HIMSELF DOWN
HE POINTED HIS FINGER AND SAID WHAT IS YON PLACE THAT ANSWERED GASCOYNE
I HEARD BLUNT TELL MOWBRAY TO GO AND GATHER THE OTHERS
WOULDST GET THYSELF SHOT WITH A BOLT BETWIXT THE RIBS LIKE POOR DICCON COOK OF ALL PLACES ABOUT THE CASTLE THE PRIVY GARDEN WAS PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED IT WAS A SMALL PLOT OF GROUND ONLY A FEW RODS LONG AND WIDE
THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
A GROUP OF GENTLEMEN WALKING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE EARL'S HOUSE THEY COULD SEE THE HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS HURRYING HITHER AND THITHER TWO LITTLE SCULLIONS AT FISTICUFFS AND A KITCHEN GIRL STANDING IN THE DOOR WAY SCRATCHING HER FROWZY HEAD
THE ROOM WAS A PERFECT CIRCLE OF ABOUT TWENTY FEET ACROSS AND WAS PILED HIGH WITH AN INDISTINGUISHABLE MASS OF LUMBER RUDE TABLES RUDER CHAIRS ANCIENT CHESTS BITS AND REMNANTS OF CLOTH AND SACKING AND LEATHER
NEVERTHELESS IN RETURN FOR ALL THAT IT WILL SO GREATLY ADVANTAGE THEE WILT THOU NOT GRANT ME A BOON IN RETURN SHOULD I OVERCOME MINE ENEMY WHAT IS THY BOON SIR MYLES THAT THOU WILT GRANT ME THY FAVOR TO SEEK THE LADY ALICE DE MOWBRAY
ON ONE SIDE THE GREAT HOUSES AND PALACES OF PRINCELY PRIESTS AND POWERFUL NOBLES ON THE OTHER THE COVENT GARDEN OR THE CONVENT GARDEN AS IT WAS THEN CALLED AND THE ROLLING COUNTRY WHERE GREAT STONE WINDMILLS SWUNG THEIR SLOW MOVING ARMS IN THE DAMP SOFT APRIL BREEZE
WE WILL CALL IT OUR EYRY SAID GASCOYNE
HE HAD ACCEPTED THE CHANGE FROM THEIR EARLIER STATE AND THE BALD POVERTY OF THEIR LIFE AT CROSBEY HOLT WITH THE EASY CARELESSNESS OF BOYHOOD
AND THEIR OBJECT TO BE THE RIGHTING OF WRONGS AS THEY SAID MYLES OF ARTHUR HIS ROUND TABLE DID RIGHT WRONGS BUT PRITHEE WHAT WRONGS ARE THERE TO RIGHT IN THIS PLACE QUOTH GASCOYNE
HANGING UPON A SINGLE RUSTY HINGE AND FROM THE ROOM WITHIN A DULL GRAY LIGHT GLIMMERED FAINTLY MYLES PUSHED THE DOOR FARTHER OPEN IT CREAKED AND GRATED HORRIBLY ON ITS RUSTY HINGE AND
AND IT FLAMED TO A ROSIER RED AS HE BOWED HIS HEAD TO HER BEFORE TURNING AWAY GASCOYNE HAD JUST REMOVED MYLES'S BREASTPLATE AND GORGET WHEN SIR JAMES LEE BURST INTO THE PAVILION ALL HIS GRIM COLDNESS WAS GONE
THE INNER STAIRCASES THE WINDING PASSAGE WAYS THE QUEER NICHES AND CUPBOARD AND THE BLACK SHAFT OF A WELL THAT PIERCED DOWN INTO THE SOLID WALL AND WHENCE PERHAPS THE OLD CASTLE FOLK HAD ONE TIME DRAWN THEIR SUPPLY OF WATER IN TIME OF SIEGE
THEY ELECTED MYLES AS THEIR GRAND HIGH COMMANDER AND HELD SECRET MEETINGS IN THE ANCIENT TOWER WHERE MANY MYSTERIES WERE SOBERLY ENACTED OF COURSE IN A DAY OR TWO ALL THE BODY OF SQUIRES KNEW NEARLY EVERYTHING CONCERNING THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE
I WOULD NOT FACE ONE SUCH FOR WORLDS IT WAS DURING THE SHORT TIME WHEN SO TO SPEAK THE TWO OWNED THE SOLITUDE OF THE BRUTUS TOWER THAT MYLES TOLD HIS FRIEND OF HIS FATHER'S OUTLAWRY AND OF THE PERIL IN WHICH THE FAMILY STOOD
IT WAS OF SEASONED OAK SOMEWHAT THICKER THAN THE OTHER A TOUGH WEAPON
TO MAKE UP A ROLL OF TWENTY NAMES IN ALL GASCOYNE HAD AS I SAID ENTERED INTO THE MATTER WITH SPIRIT AND PERHAPS IT WAS OWING MORE TO HIM THAN TO ANY OTHER THAT THE PROJECT CAUGHT ITS DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR OF ROMANCE PERCHANCE SAID HE
THEN WITHOUT MAKING ANSWER HE TURNED AND WALKED SLOWLY AWAY TO HIS PAVILION STILL LEANING ON HIS SQUIRE'S SHOULDER
BLUNT IS GOING TO SERVE THEE OUT TO DAY AND I MYSELF HEARD HIM SAY SO HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO SLIT THINE EARS AND THEN HE WAS GONE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED MYLES DARTED AFTER HIM CAUGHT HIM MIDWAY IN THE QUADRANGLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK SQUALLING AND STRUGGLING
ONE OF WHICH IN REMEMBERING ALWAYS FILLED MYLES'S HEART IN AFTER YEARS WITH AN INDEFINABLE PLEASURE WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF STANDING WITH OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW SQUIRES
THAT SEEMED TO RACK EVERY JOINT HE HEARD THE CRACKLE OF SPLINTERED WOOD
AS MAYHAP MAY MAKE A LAD A MAN BEFORE HIS TIME FROM WHICH I GATHER SAID THE EARL THAT MANY ADVENTURES HAVE BEFALLEN THEE METHOUGHT THOU WOULDST FIND TROUBLESOME TIMES IN THE DAUPHIN'S CAMP ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE SENT THEE TO FRANCE A LITTLE SPACE OF SILENCE FOLLOWED
AND THE NEXT MOMENT A BUGLE SOUNDED LOUD AND CLEAR IN ONE BLINDING RUSH HE DROVE HIS SPURS INTO THE SIDES OF HIS HORSE AND IN INSTANT ANSWER FELT THE NOBLE STEED SPRING FORWARD WITH A BOUND THROUGH ALL THE CLASHING OF HIS ARMOR REVERBERATING IN THE HOLLOW DEPTHS OF HIS HELMET
AND SEVERAL OF THE LADS HAD GONE BACK ALMOST AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE PRIVY GARDEN TO CATCH ANY BALL THAT MIGHT CHANCE TO FLY AS FAR AS THAT THEN ONCE MORE MYLES STRUCK THROWING ALL HIS STRENGTH INTO THE BLOW THE BALL SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
SIR SAID HE HAPLY THINE ENDS ARE AS MUCH BEYOND AUGHT THAT I CAN COMPREHEND AS THOUGH I WERE A LITTLE CHILD ONLY THIS I KNOW THAT THEY MUST BE VERY GREAT THOU KNOWEST WELL THAT IN ANY CASE I WOULD FIGHT ME THIS BATTLE FOR MY FATHER'S SAKE AND FOR THE HONOR OF MY HOUSE
THE LADY ANNE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A TALL THIN DARK EYED DARK HAIRED HANDSOME YOUNG DAME OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAWK NOSED LIKE HER FATHER AND SILENT PROUD AND HAUGHTY MYLES HEARD THE SQUIRES SAY
JOINED IN THE PRAISE AND CONGRATULATION THAT POURED UPON THE YOUNG CONQUEROR MYLES HIS HEART SWELLING WITH A PASSION OF TRIUMPHANT DELIGHT LOOKED UP AND MET THE GAZE OF LADY ALICE FIXED INTENTLY UPON HIM A RED SPOT OF EXCITEMENT STILL BURNED IN EITHER CHEEK
NOW HE JOGGED ALONG WITH GASCOYNE
AND FOUND HIMSELF GRIPPING WITH NERVOUS INTENSITY THE BUTT OF A BROKEN SPEAR
HE ALSO RECOGNIZED HOW GENEROUS WAS THE FRIENDSHIP OF PRIOR EDWARD WHO PERILLED HIS OWN SAFETY SO GREATLY IN AFFORDING THE FAMILY
AND WHEN IT FELL IT WAS TO DROP WITHIN THE PRIVY GARDEN THE SHOUTS OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS WERE INSTANTLY STILLED AND GASCOYNE WHO STOOD NEAREST MYLES THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BELT GIVING A LONG SHRILL WHISTLE
I WILL MAKE HIM SEE THAT I BOTH UNDERSTAND AND SHALL INSIST UPON MY RIGHTS IN THIS MATTER BUT YOU MAY TELL MISS DORIS THAT I WILL SIT OUT OF SIGHT AND THAT I SHALL NOT OBTRUDE MYSELF
HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS PAST HIS PRESENT AND HIS FUTURE ALONE HE NEEDED TO BE THE STRONGEST MUST PAUSE WHEN THE PRECIPICE YAWNS BEFORE HIM THE GULF CAN BE SPANNED
I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR OPINION THOUGH GIVEN SOMEWHAT COLDLY COINCIDES WITH THAT OF HIS FRIENDS I AM NOT GIVEN TO EXAGGERATION WAS THE EVEN REPLY
THIS WAS NOT EVEN THE LOVE HE HAD GIVEN TO EDITH CHALLONER THIS WAS SOMETHING SPRINGING FULL BORN OUT OF NOTHING A FORCE WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE MADE HIM COMPLAISANT TO THE NATURAL WEAKNESSES OF MAN
BUT ON CASTING HIS GLANCES ELSEWHERE HE WAS RELIEVED TO SEE HIM STANDING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE STREET HIS BACK WAS TO THE ROOM AND HE SEEMED TO BE LOST IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION AS ORLANDO CROSSED TO HIM
A BARB HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THIS SIMPLE STATEMENT WHICH HAD REACHED SOME DEEPLY HIDDEN BUT VULNERABLE SPOT IN BROTHERSON'S BREAST WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN PIERCED BEFORE HIS EYE WHICH ALONE SEEMED ALIVE
AS ORLANDO REALISED THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AGHAST AT THE POSSIBILITIES CONFRONTING HIM FROM THIS LINE OF THOUGHT SHOULD HE CONTEMPLATE THEM RISK HIS REASON BY DWELLING ON A SUPPOSITION WHICH MIGHT HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT
SUGGESTED THE LATTER AS AN OPPRESSIVE SILENCE SWALLOWED UP THAT ICY SENTENCE I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED I HAVE RETURNED MISTER CHALLONER REGAINING HIS COURAGE UNDER THE EXIGENCIES OF THE MOMENT
IT MUST BE WITH THE FULL UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ESPECIAL TOPIC WAS TO BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED BUT IN WHAT WORDS COULD HE URGE SUCH A REQUEST UPON THIS MAN NONE SUGGESTED THEMSELVES
BUT ANOTHER LOOK AT OSWALD AND HE WAS READY TO DO HIS BIDDING THE BITTER ORDEAL WAS OVER LET HIM HAVE HIS SOLACE
THE FLUSH WHICH HAD COME INTO MISTER CHALLONER'S CHEEK UNDER THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO SUSTAIN WITH UNFLINCHING HEROISM THIS INTERVIEW WITH THE MAN HE LOOKED UPON AS HIS MORTAL ENEMY SLOWLY FADED OUT
AND THEN HAD COME UP AGAINST THIS LOVE WHEN HE THOUGHT SUCH FOLLY DEAD REMORSE WHEN GLORY CALLED FOR THE QUIET MIND AND HEART HE RECOGNISED ITS MORDANT FANG AND KNEW THAT ITS RAVAGES
THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT THING TO DO DORIS WAS SOON TO REALISE MISTER CHALLONER CONTINUED TO PASS THE HOUSE TWICE A DAY AND THE TIME FINALLY CAME WHEN HE VENTURED UP THE WALK
BUT MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT SHOT SHE DIED FROM A STAB
AND AS CONVENTIONALITIES WOULD NATURALLY PLACE THEM OSWALD WAS A SENTIMENTALIST BUT VERY RESERVED ABOUT HIS SENTIMENTALITIES IF THESE SUPPOSITIONS WERE TRUE HE HAD HAD A SENTIMENTALIST'S MOTIVE FOR WHAT HE DID
NOTHING WHICH HAD YET PASSED SHOWED THAT THIS MAN REALISED THE FACT THAT OSWALD HAD BEEN KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF MISS CHALLONER'S DEATH IF THESE BROTHERS WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW
HAD HE FOUND THE CONNECTING LINK HAD IT BEEN COULD IT HAVE BEEN EDITH THE PREPOSTEROUS IS SOMETIMES TRUE COULD IT BE TRUE IN THIS CASE
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS WHOLE HISTORY TO GIVE HIM AN UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH FEELINGS AS THESE CAN A MAN BE SEIZED AS IT WERE BY THE HAIR AND SWUNG UP ON THE SLOPES OF PARADISE OR DOWN THE STEEPS OF HELL WITHOUT A FOREWARNING
THE CHILD WAS STAGGERING AND THE HAND WHICH WAS FREE HAD SOUGHT HER HEART WHERE IT LAY CLENCHED THE KNUCKLES SHOWING WHITE IN THE DIM LIGHT MISTER CHALLONER WATCHED HER WITH DILATED EYES
NO HIS BRAIN WAS TOO FULL HIS PURPOSES TOO IMPORTANT FOR ANY UNNECESSARY STRAIN TO BE PUT UPON HIS FACULTIES NO THINKING INVESTIGATION FIRST
STARTLING THEM BOTH AND CAUSING HIM TO STEP QUICKLY BACK WHO IS IT SHE ASKED FATHER'S IN AND VISITORS SELDOM COME SO LATE SHALL I SEE
SHE HAD THE GREATEST DESIRE TO SEE THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO COULD SPEAK LIKE THIS TO DAY AND YET OF WHOSE PRIDE AND SENSE OF SUPERIORITY HIS DAUGHTER HAD STOOD IN SUCH AWE THAT SHE HAD LAID A SEAL UPON THE IMPULSES OF HER HEART
ONLY NOT HERE NOT WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE DRIVING PAST MOST OF WHOM KNOW ME COME TO THE HOUSE LATER
HE WOULD SEE HER SOON AGAIN AND POSSIBLY LEARN SOMETHING WHICH WOULD AMPLY REPAY HIM BOTH FOR HIS TROUBLE AND HIS PATIENCE BUT WHEN EVENING CAME AND SHE TURNED TO FACE HIM IN THAT LITTLE SITTING ROOM WHERE HE HAD QUIETLY FOLLOWED HER
HER HAND FELL CLENCHED ON HER BREAST AND HER EYES GLEAMED STRANGELY MISTER CHALLONER WAS HIMSELF GREATLY STARTLED WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED SINCE YESTERDAY THAT SHE SHOULD EMPHASISE THAT NOW
YET IT WAS NOT I WHO HAD BEEN SHOT SHE ADDED SOFTLY MISTER CHALLONER SHUDDERED THIS WAS LIKE THE REOPENING OF HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE
ORLANDO BROTHERSON DESPAIR WHILE HIS GREAT WORK LAY UNFINISHED THAT WOULD BE TO LAY STRESS ON THE INEVITABLE PAINS AND FEARS OF COMMONPLACE HUMANITY HE WAS NOT OF THAT ILK
SHE SLIPPED SOFTLY OUT AND INTERCEPTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD STEPPED UPON THE PORCH SHE HAD CAUGHT UP HER HAT AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL AND WAS FITTING IT TO HER HEAD AS HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HER MISS SCOTT HE ASKED
WITHOUT THE CHANCE EVEN TO SAY WHETHER HE WISHED SUCH A CATACLYSM IN HIS LIFE OR NO
WITH PAINS ALTOGETHER OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS CHARACTER HE SOUGHT IN THE RECESSES OF HIS DARKENED MIND FOR WORDS
IT SHOULD BE BUT A TURN A MAN'S JOYS ARE NOT BOUNDED BY HIS LOVES OR EVEN BY THE SATISFACTION OF A PERFECTLY UNTRAMMELLED MIND
BUT THEY WERE MEANT FOR OSWALD YOU BELIEVE THAT NOW I KNOW IT AND THAT IS WHY I FOUND YOU IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM IT IS PROVIDENCE HAS ROBBED ME OF MY DAUGHTER
NOTHING EXCITES MY INTEREST SAVE THAT WHICH ONCE EXCITED HERS I AM TOLD THAT THE DEEPEST INTEREST OF HER LIFE LAY HERE I AM ALSO TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INTEREST QUITE WORTHY OF HER
LOCKING HIMSELF IN HE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE ROOF AND THEN SAT DOWN BEFORE THE CAR WHICH WAS RAPIDLY TAKING ON SHAPE AND ASSUMING
I'VE NOT TOLD ANY ONE SHE WENT ON AS HE STOPPED SHORT IN THE ROAD IN HIS ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND HER BUT I WILL TELL YOU
POSSIBLY SEEN PICTURES WHICH WOULD MAKE THE PLACE QUITE REAL TO YOU THE MIND IS A STRANGE STOREHOUSE WE DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHAT LIES HIDDEN WITHIN IT THAT'S TRUE SHE ADMITTED BUT THE MAN
I HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE AGREEABLE TO HIM I HOPE THAT I AM NOT PRESUMING TOO MUCH IN CHERISHING THESE EXPECTATIONS DORIS TURNED HER CANDID EYES UPON HIM I CANNOT TELL I DO NOT KNOW
AND NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD EVER ATTAIN THE DELIGHTS EACH WAS SO FITTED TO ENJOY WHY SHOULDN'T HE LAUGH WHAT IS LEFT TO MAN BUT MOCKERY WHEN ALL PROPS FALL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE UNIVERSAL LOT
SHE SEEMED TO BE QUITE READY FOR THIS ANXIETY ABOUT HER PATIENT HAD REGAINED ITS PLACE IN HER MIND AND HER GLANCE SPED CONSTANTLY TOWARD THE DOOR TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID SOME KIND WORDS
THEN DEATH FOLLOWS THE IMPULSE WHICH GIVEN AN INSTANT OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE VANISHED IN A BACK SWEEP OF OTHER EMOTIONS CHANCE WAS THE REAL ACCESSORY TO THIS DEATH BY SUICIDE OSWALD
UNLESS MY NAME IS BROUGHT UP IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY THE HAND ON THE DOOR KNOB MADE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT MISTER BROTHERSON I CAN BEAR NO MORE TO NIGHT WITH YOUR PERMISSION
OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY OF YOUR DECEASED DAUGHTER IN FACT NO SHE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH OSWALD BROTHERSON SHE WAS WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE
AND HIS PRESENCE IN ANY COMPANY ALWAYS ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND ROUSED IF IT NEVER SATISFIED CURIOSITY CONVERSATION ACCORDINGLY CEASED AS HE STRODE UP TO MISTER CHALLONER'S SIDE
MISTER CHALLONER SIGHED HE HAD REALLY ANTICIPATED SOMETHING FROM THE INTERVIEW THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN A MOMENT OF EXPECTATION THE THRILL WHICH COMES TO US ALL UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE SUPERNATURAL
NOTHING BUT THE STERN LANGUAGE SUITABLE TO THE STERN FACT HE WISHED TO IMPART WOULD LEAVE HIS LIPS AND ENDED THE PITIFUL STRUGGLE OF THE MOMENT WITH ONE QUICK UNPREMEDITATED BLOW WAS WHAT HE SAID
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE APT TO BROACH THIS SUBJECT WITH ANY ONE LET ALONE WITH HIM WHOSE CONNECTION WITH IT I SHALL NEED DAYS TO REALISE I'M NOT SO GIVEN TO GOSSIP BESIDES HE AND I HAVE OTHER TOPICS OF INTEREST
SCIENCE HAD BEEN HIS MISTRESS AMBITION HIS LODE STAR SUCH FEELING AS HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAD BEEN FOR MEN STRUGGLING MEN MEN WHO WERE DOWN TRODDEN AND GASPING IN THE NARROW BOUNDS OF POVERTY AND HELPLESSNESS
MISTER CHALLONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION HE WOULD SEE HIM EVEN AT THIS LATE HOUR HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIND HIM IN ONE OF THE ROOMS BELOW
AND AROUND IT WAS GROUPED A NUMBER OF MEN WITH THEIR PAPERS AND PIPES MISTER BROTHERSON ENTERING NATURALLY LOOKED THAT WAY FOR THE MAN HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AND WAS DISAPPOINTED NOT TO FIND HIM THERE
UNKNOWN SOMETHING WHICH HAD SOFTENED THAT HARD MAN'S EYE WHEN HIS BROTHER'S NAME WAS MENTIONED HE HAD NOTED IT AND REALISED THE MYSTERY A MYSTERY BEFORE WHICH SLEEP AND REST MUST FLY A MYSTERY TO WHICH HE MUST NOW GIVE HIS THOUGHT
BUT HIS ANSWER WAS COURTEOUS ENOUGH IF MISTER BROTHERSON KNEW A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE LEFT UNDISTURBED HE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM IF HE WOULD BE VERY BRIEF
TILL HE LOOKED THE WRAITH OF HIMSELF EVEN TO THE UNSYMPATHETIC EYES OF ORLANDO BROTHERSON A DUTY LAY BEFORE HIM WHICH WOULD TAX TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT HIS ALREADY GREATLY WEAKENED SELF CONTROL
HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO LIFT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD IN A GESTURE OF SURPRISING HELPLESSNESS FOR HIM WHILE SNATCHES OF BROKEN SENTENCES FELL FROM HIS LIPS AMONG WHICH COULD BE HEARD WHAT HAS COME TO ME
IT WAS POINTED DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME ABOVE ALL I SAW HIS FACE IT WAS THE FACE OF ONE WHOSE FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER AND WHO MEANS DEATH
AND THE CROWN OF ALL IMAGINABLE BLISSES HE WAS STARTLED AT HIS OWN EMOTION AS HE CONTEMPLATED HER IMAGE IN HIS FANCY AND LISTENED FOR THE LOST ECHO OF THE FEW WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN
YOU HAVE HAD MUCH TO CARRY FOR ONE SO YOUNG WAS MISTER CHALLONER'S SYMPATHETIC REMARK YOU MUST LET ME HELP YOU WHEN THAT AWFUL MOMENT COMES I AM AT THE HOTEL AND SHALL STAY THERE TILL MISTER BROTHERSON IS PRONOUNCED QUITE WELL
WITHOUT A WORD HE WHEELED ABOUT TOWARDS THE DOOR WITHOUT A WORD BROTHERSON STOOD WATCHING HIM GO TILL HE SAW HIS HAND FALL ON THE KNOB WHEN HE QUIETLY PREVENTED HIS EXIT BY SAYING
CHAOS IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND MISTER CHALLONER'S FEELINGS OR EVEN THOSE OF DORIS AT THE MOMENT OF MISTER BROTHERSON'S DEPARTURE BUT WHY THIS CHANGE IN BROTHERSON HIMSELF
SHE NODDED LOOKING STRANGELY TROUBLED AS THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN REVEALING THE TALL STRONG FIGURE OF A MAN FACING THEM FROM THE PORCH A STRANGER FORMED ITSELF UPON HER LIPS
THE SPELL UNDER WHICH SHE SPOKE FALLING IN SOME DEGREE UPON HIM HAD SHE FINISHED WAS THIS ALL
WAS MISTER CHALLONER'S IMMEDIATE INQUIRY THIS I MAKE NO APOLOGIES AND EXPECT IN ANSWER NOTHING MORE THAN AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES OR NO YOU TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NEVER MET MY BROTHER CAN THAT BE SAID
AS SHE CAST HIM A CONFIDING LOOK WHICH PLEASED HIM GREATLY AS HIS TONE NOW SHOWED WHEN I LOST MY DAUGHTER I LOST EVERYTHING HE DECLARED AS THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP THE ROAD
I AM LOOKING INTO INTO WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE HOW MUCH WHITER WAS THIS MAN'S HEAD THAN IN THE LAST INTERVIEW HE HAD HELD WITH HIM IN THE CORONER'S OFFICE IN NEW YORK BUT THIS EVIDENCE OF GRIEF IN ONE WITH WHOM HE HAD LITTLE IF ANYTHING IN COMMON
IT CANNOT BE KEPT FROM HIM MUCH LONGER WHEN I RETURN I SHALL SHRINK FROM HIS FIRST LOOK IN THE FEAR OF SEEING IT BETRAY THIS DREADFUL KNOWLEDGE YET I HAVE A FAITHFUL WOMAN THERE TO KEEP EVERY ONE OUT OF HIS ROOM
AND TURN TO WHAT REMAINS TO US OF LIFE AND LABOUR WORK IS GRIEF'S ONLY CONSOLATION THEN LET US WORK BUT OF ALL THIS OSWALD HAD CAUGHT BUT THE ONE WORD CHANCE HE REPEATED
UNKNOWN YESTERDAY UNKNOWN AN HOUR AGO BUT NOW HAD THERE EVER BEEN A DAY AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAD NOT BEEN AS THE VERY THROB OF HIS HEART THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES
AND SOAR INTO THE HEAVEN OF FAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIS FLIGHT INTO THE OPEN HE COULD WAIT FOR THAT HOUR HE HAD MEASURED THE GULF BEFORE HIM AND FOUND IT PASSABLE HENCEFORTH
OSWALD THE TONE WAS CONTROLLING AND YET THAT OF ONE STRONG MAN TO ANOTHER IS IT FOR US TO READ THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN LEAST OF ALL OF A WOMAN OF HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND KEEN INNER LIFE
THE EFFUSIONS OF HER MIND THE BREATHINGS OF HER HEART DIRECTED TO AN ACTUAL O B AND THAT O B HIS BROTHER THEY HAD NOT BEEN MEANT FOR HIM HE HAD READ ENOUGH OF THE MAWKISH LINES TO BE SURE OF THAT
YOU WILL NOT FIND YOUR CONFIDENCE MISPLACED OSWALD IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD FELLOW OF FEW FAULTS I BELIEVE IT NO MAN CAN BE SO UNIVERSALLY BELOVED WITHOUT SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS TO REGARD
RISING SUPERIOR TO THE OVERTHROW OF ALL HIS HOPES FOR A WOMAN OF EDITH'S PRINCIPLE TO SEEK DEATH IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION THE PROVOCATION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
PERFORMANCE MAKES A WORLD OF ITS OWN FOR THE CAPABLE AND THE STRONG AND THIS WAS STILL LEFT TO HIM
A MAN HAD STOOD AT THE STAIRCASE AND THIS MAN HAD RAISED HIS ARM SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE A PISTOL IN HIS HAND BUT HIS DAUGHTER HAD NOT BEEN SHOT THIS HE THOUGHT IT WELL TO POINT OUT TO HER
WHY THIS SENSE OF SOMETHING NEW AND TERRIBLE RISING BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUDDENLY BECLOUDED FUTURE LET US FOLLOW HIM TO HIS LONELY HOTEL ROOM AND SEE IF WE CAN SOLVE THE PUZZLE BUT FIRST
WILL THAT BE TOO EARLY NO NO OH HOW THOSE PEOPLE STARED LET US HASTEN BACK OR THEY MAY CONNECT YOUR NAME WITH WHAT WE WANT KEPT SECRET HE SMILED AT HER FEARS BUT GAVE IN TO HER HUMOUR
YOU SEE ME AGAIN MISTER CHALLONER MAY I BEG OF YOU A FEW MINUTES FURTHER CONVERSATION I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU LONG THE GREY HEAD TURNED AND THE MANY EYES WATCHING SHOWED SURPRISE AT THE EXPRESSION OF DISLIKE AND REPULSION
DOES HE UNDERSTAND HIS OWN TROUBLE HE DOES NOT SEEM TO FOR WHEN HIS HAT THROWN ASIDE HE STOPS ERECT AND FROWNING UNDER THE FLARING GAS JET HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF LIGHTING
I HAVE READ SOME OF THOSE LETTERS THE INVENTOR FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE POLICE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO PLACE THEM UNDER MY EYE SUPPOSING THEM TO HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE INITIALS WRITTEN ON THE WRAPPER
NEITHER TOUCHED HIS FEELINGS NOR DETERRED HIS STEP THE AWAKENING OF HIS HEART TO NEW AND PROFOUND EMOTIONS HAD NOT SOFTENED HIM TOWARDS THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
WHATEVER THE COST WHATEVER THE LOSS TO THOSE HEAVENLY DREAMS THE MAGIC OF WHICH WAS SO NEW IT SEEMED TO ENVELOPE HIM IN THE BALM OF PARADISE AWAY THEN IMAGE OF LIGHT LET THE FACULTIES THOU HAST DAZED ACT AGAIN
LATER I HOPE TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER BROTHERSON SHE GAVE HIM ONE QUICK LOOK TREMBLING SO THAT HE OFFERED HER HIS ARM WITH A FATHERLY AIR
SEEMED TO RECONCILE HIM TO THIS UNCONVENTIONAL REQUEST BOWING HE TOOK HIS FOOT FROM THE STEP SAYING AS SHE JOINED HIM YES YOU ARE THE ONE I WANTED TO SEE THAT IS TO DAY
YOU WHO HAVE EVERY REASON TO UNDERSTAND MY REASONS FOR THIS WILL ACCEPT THE STATEMENT I HOPE AS FRANKLY AS IT IS MADE SHE NODDED HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS BUT SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO RAISE THEM
BUT NOW AND HERE THE OTHER DEMON SPRANG ERECT AND GRAPPLED WITH HIM BEFORE THE FIRST ONE HAD LET GO HIS HOLD OSWALD AND CHALLONER THE SECRET
A BESTOWING VIRTUE IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE VERILY I DIVINE YOU WELL MY DISCIPLES YE STRIVE LIKE ME FOR THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
IT IS CONSEQUENTLY FOR THAT REASON THAT THOU THYSELF ALWAYS BECOMETH YELLOWER AND DARKER ALTHOUGH THY HAIR LOOKETH WHITE AND FLAXEN
FOR EVERYWHERE DO I SMELL SMALL CONCEALED COMMUNITIES AND WHEREVER THERE ARE CLOSETS THERE ARE NEW DEVOTEES THEREIN AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF DEVOTEES
WOULD THEY GET OUT OF THEIR SKIN THEREFORE HEARKEN THEY TO THE PREACHERS OF DEATH AND THEMSELVES PREACH BACKWORLDS HEARKEN RATHER MY BRETHREN TO THE VOICE OF THE HEALTHY BODY IT IS A MORE UPRIGHT
THY SEEKING SECURETH ME I SUFFER BUT FOR THEE WHAT WOULD I NOT GLADLY BEAR FOR THEE WHOSE COLDNESS INFLAMETH WHOSE HATRED MISLEADETH
AND HAD COVERED HIS FACE DURING THE TIME BUT WHEN HE HEARD ZARATHUSTRA LAUGH HE LOOKED UP WITH CURIOSITY AND SAID SLOWLY BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO US THAN UNTO HIS DISCIPLES
FOR THERE IS A SALT WHICH UNITETH GOOD WITH EVIL
WHAT DO WE THINK BAD AND WORST OF ALL IS IT NOT DEGENERATION AND WE ALWAYS SUSPECT DEGENERATION WHEN THE BESTOWING SOUL IS LACKING UPWARD
WHO MAKETH HIMSELF WHOLE A THOUSAND PATHS ARE THERE WHICH HAVE NEVER YET BEEN TRODDEN A THOUSAND SALUBRITIES AND HIDDEN ISLANDS OF LIFE
THE SOOTHSAYER HOWEVER SHALL EAT AND DRINK AT MY SIDE AND VERILY I WILL YET SHOW HIM A SEA IN WHICH HE CAN DROWN HIMSELF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
SO RICH IS THE WORLD IN WONDERFUL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN WORLD THE HUMAN SEA TOWARDS IT DO I NOW THROW OUT MY GOLDEN ANGLE ROD AND SAY OPEN UP
UNTO WHICH ALL WINDS COME AS UNTO THE STORM PARTING ASKING WHERE AND WHENCE AND WHITHER HERE LAUGH LAUGH MY HEARTY HEALTHY WICKEDNESS FROM HIGH MOUNTAINS CAST DOWN THY GLITTERING SCORN LAUGHTER
HE LAYETH GREAT STRESS ON ONE'S BELIEVING HIM AY AY BELIEF SAVETH HIM BELIEF IN HIM
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER ANSWERED THUS UNTO HIM WHO SO SPAKE WHEN ONE TAKETH HIS HUMP FROM THE HUNCHBACK THEN DOTH ONE TAKE FROM HIM HIS SPIRIT
THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
AND WHERE THERE WAS SUFFERING IT WAS CLAIMED THERE WAS ALWAYS PENALTY PENALTY SO CALLETH ITSELF REVENGE WITH A LYING WORD IT FEIGNETH A GOOD CONSCIENCE
GOOD TIDINGS ARE PROCLAIMED YE LONESOME ONES OF TO DAY YE SECEDING ONES YE SHALL ONE DAY BE A PEOPLE OUT OF YOU WHO HAVE CHOSEN YOURSELVES
THE STILLEST HOUR WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME MY FRIENDS YE SEE ME TROUBLED DRIVEN FORTH UNWILLINGLY OBEDIENT READY TO GO ALAS TO GO AWAY FROM YOU
WITH CROOKED GLANCES DOST THOU TEACH ME CROOKED COURSES ON CROOKED COURSES LEARN MY FEET CRAFTY FANCIES I FEAR THEE NEAR I LOVE THEE FAR THY FLIGHT ALLURETH ME
IS THERE AN ALL TOO POOR AND HUNGRY KIND WHICH WOULD ALWAYS STEAL THE SELFISHNESS OF THE SICK THE SICKLY SELFISHNESS WITH THE EYE OF THE THIEF
MEANWHILE HOWEVER
HANGETH TO DAY OUTCHAMPED AND OUTCHEWED FROM THE MOUTHS OF THE MEN OF TO DAY EVERYTHING AMONG THEM TALKETH EVERYTHING IS BETRAYED
A SINKING DRINKING REBLINKING GOLDEN SWING BARK AT MY DANCE FRANTIC FOOT DOST THOU CAST A GLANCE A LAUGHING QUESTIONING MELTING THROWN GLANCE
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES AND VERILY I AM WELL DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
THOU WONDERFUL THING THOU NOISE IN DARK STREETS
AND WHY SHOULD NOT ZARATHUSTRA ALSO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE WHEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM ZARATHUSTRA IT IS HOWEVER THE SMALLEST THING UNTO ME SINCE I HAVE BEEN AMONGST MEN
CAN THERE BE DELIVERANCE WHEN THERE IS ETERNAL JUSTICE ALAS UNROLLABLE IS THE STONE IT WAS ETERNAL MUST ALSO BE ALL PENALTIES THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
LET THIS BE OUR FINAL WILL AT THE GREAT NOONTIDE
WITH SHARP BREEZES TICKLED
AS ON A BATTLE AND BUTCHER GROUND AND WHEN MINE EYE FLEETH FROM THE PRESENT TO THE BYGONE IT FINDETH EVER THE SAME FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS AND FEARFUL CHANCES BUT NO MEN
THEN PERHAPS WOULD HE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE AND LOVE THE EARTH AND LAUGHTER ALSO BELIEVE IT MY BRETHREN HE DIED TOO EARLY HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE DISAVOWED HIS DOCTRINE HAD HE ATTAINED TO MY AGE
ANOTHER MATTER HOWEVER IS FORSAKENNESS FOR DOST THOU REMEMBER O ZARATHUSTRA WHEN THY BIRD SCREAMED OVERHEAD
AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME AND IS LIKE MOLTEN PITCH THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY AROUND HIM AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIM O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY
THAN IN THE LIGHT HERE FLY OPEN UNTO ME ALL BEING'S WORDS AND WORD CABINETS HERE ALL BEING WANTETH TO BECOME WORDS
THY JOURNEY IS SHORT SAID THE ADDER SADLY MY POISON IS FATAL ZARATHUSTRA SMILED WHEN DID EVER A DRAGON DIE OF A SERPENT'S POISON SAID HE
THOU GOEST THE WAY OF THE LOVING ONE THOU LOVEST THYSELF AND ON THAT ACCOUNT DESPISEST THOU THYSELF AS ONLY THE LOVING ONES DESPISE TO CREATE DESIRETH THE LOVING ONE
LIKE THE STONE BY MANY DROPS OF WICKEDNESS THUS DID I SIT AMONG THEM AND STILL SAID TO MYSELF INNOCENT IS EVERYTHING PETTY OF ITS PETTINESS
BOTH ALIKE HOSTILE TO ALL FLESH AND BLOOD OH HOW REPUGNANT ARE BOTH TO MY TASTE FOR I LOVE BLOOD
MORALLY ARE THINGS ORDERED ACCORDING TO JUSTICE AND PENALTY OH WHERE IS THERE DELIVERANCE FROM THE FLUX OF THINGS AND FROM THE EXISTENCE OF PENALTY THUS DID MADNESS PREACH
SHALL A CHOSEN PEOPLE ARISE AND OUT OF IT THE SUPERMAN VERILY A PLACE OF HEALING SHALL THE EARTH BECOME AND ALREADY IS A NEW ODOUR DIFFUSED AROUND IT
AND JUST THEY WOULD FAIN CRUCIFY THOSE WHO DEVISE THEIR OWN VIRTUE THEY HATE THE LONESOME ONES BE ON THY GUARD ALSO AGAINST HOLY SIMPLICITY ALL IS UNHOLY TO IT THAT IS NOT SIMPLE
TOO EARLY DIED THAT HEBREW WHOM THE PREACHERS OF SLOW DEATH HONOUR AND TO MANY HATH IT PROVED A CALAMITY THAT HE DIED TOO EARLY AS YET HAD HE KNOWN ONLY TEARS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF THE HEBREWS
WHO HAVE EVER TO WAIT
THAN GIVING AND STEALING
SO I DREAMED NIGHT WATCHMAN AND GRAVE GUARDIAN HAD I BECOME ALOFT IN THE LONE MOUNTAIN FORTRESS OF DEATH THERE DID I GUARD HIS COFFINS FULL STOOD THE MUSTY VAULTS OF THOSE TROPHIES OF VICTORY
BUT IT ALSO THRUSTETH ITS HEAD HEAVILY INTO THE HEAVY EARTH
THOU INDIVIDUAL TO DAY HAST THOU STILL THY COURAGE UNABATED AND THY HOPES BUT ONE DAY WILL THE SOLITUDE WEARY THEE ONE DAY WILL THY PRIDE YIELD AND THY COURAGE QUAIL
OR ROLLED OLD SHATTERED TABLES INTO PRECIPITOUS DEPTHS
AND LONG DID HE BALANCE THE STAFF DOUBTFULLY IN HIS HAND AT LAST HE SPAKE THUS AND HIS VOICE HAD CHANGED I NOW GO ALONE MY DISCIPLES YE ALSO NOW GO AWAY AND ALONE
AND PROMISING ONES THUS SHOULD ONE LEARN TO DIE AND THERE SHOULD BE NO FESTIVAL AT WHICH SUCH A DYING ONE DOTH NOT CONSECRATE THE OATHS OF THE LIVING THUS TO DIE IS BEST
WHOSE LOT IS TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF AUTUMN AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY BECOME RIPE YELLOW AND SHRIVELLED IN SOME AGETH THE HEART FIRST AND IN OTHERS THE SPIRIT
EVER TO SAY YE A THAT HATH ONLY THE ASS LEARNT AND THOSE LIKE IT DEEP YELLOW AND HOT RED SO WANTETH MY TASTE IT MIXETH BLOOD WITH ALL COLOURS
AROUND HIM ABOVE HIM AND BELOW HIM AND REPELLED THE TENDER BIRDS BEHOLD THERE THEN HAPPENED TO HIM SOMETHING STILL STRANGER FOR HE GRASPED THEREBY UNAWARES INTO A MASS OF THICK WARM
AND VERILY IT CAME NOT UNTO ME FROM THE BEYOND WHAT HAPPENED MY BRETHREN I SURPASSED MYSELF THE SUFFERING ONE I CARRIED MINE OWN ASHES TO THE MOUNTAIN A BRIGHTER FLAME I CONTRIVED FOR MYSELF AND LO
AND HE HEEDED IT NOT HIS HAIR HOWEVER BECAME WHITE ONE DAY WHEN HE SAT ON A STONE IN FRONT OF HIS CAVE AND GAZED CALMLY INTO THE DISTANCE ONE THERE GAZETH
DID I CARRY HENCE INTO MY BEEHIVES THOSE YOUNG HEARTS HAVE ALREADY ALL BECOME OLD AND NOT OLD EVEN ONLY WEARY ORDINARY COMFORTABLE
NO ONE HATH YET TOLD ME BUT WELL DO I KNOW MY VALLEYS THEN WAS THERE AGAIN SPOKEN UNTO ME WITHOUT VOICE O ZARATHUSTRA
FIVE THE WORLD IS DEEP SIX AND DEEPER THAN THE DAY COULD READ SEVEN DEEP IS ITS WOE EIGHT JOY
UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE
IN OUR BODY DWELLETH STILL ALL THIS DELUSION AND BLUNDERING BODY AND WILL HATH IT THERE BECOME A HUNDRED TIMES HITHERTO
MANY A ONE HATH CAST AWAY HIS FINAL WORTH WHEN HE HATH CAST AWAY HIS SERVITUDE FREE FROM WHAT WHAT DOTH THAT MATTER TO ZARATHUSTRA CLEARLY HOWEVER SHALL THINE EYE SHOW UNTO ME
AND ECHO SIMILES ARE ALL NAMES OF GOOD AND EVIL THEY DO NOT SPEAK OUT THEY ONLY HINT A FOOL WHO SEEKETH KNOWLEDGE FROM THEM GIVE HEED MY BRETHREN
O PURE ODOURS AROUND ME HOW FROM A DEEP BREAST
MAY EASILY GET LOST HIMSELF ALL ISOLATION IS WRONG SO SAY THE HERD AND LONG DIDST THOU BELONG TO THE HERD THE VOICE OF THE HERD WILL STILL ECHO IN THEE AND WHEN THOU SAYEST
NOT IN BACKWORLDS AND REDEEMING BLOOD DROPS BUT IN THE BODY DO THEY ALSO BELIEVE MOST AND THEIR OWN BODY IS FOR THEM THE THING IN ITSELF BUT IT IS A SICKLY THING TO THEM AND GLADLY
ONE MUST DISCONTINUE BEING FEASTED UPON WHEN ONE TASTETH BEST THAT IS KNOWN BY THOSE WHO WANT TO BE LONG LOVED SOUR APPLES ARE THERE NO DOUBT
WITH ANOTHER LOVE SHALL I THEN LOVE YOU AND ONCE AGAIN SHALL YE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS UNTO ME AND CHILDREN OF ONE HOPE THEN WILL I BE WITH YOU FOR THE THIRD TIME
AT THEIR MODES OF CONSOLATION AND INGRATITUDE MAY THEY BECOME CONVALESCENTS AND OVERCOMERS AND CREATE HIGHER BODIES FOR THEMSELVES
I KNOW THOU THINKEST OF SOON LEAVING ME THERE IS AN OLD HEAVY HEAVY BOOMING CLOCK IT BOOMETH BY NIGHT UP TO THY CAVE WHEN THOU HEAREST THIS CLOCK STRIKE THE HOURS AT MIDNIGHT
OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE RING OF RINGS
AND HOUSE WITH THYSELF HERE CANST THOU UTTER EVERYTHING AND UNBOSOM ALL MOTIVES NOTHING IS HERE ASHAMED OF CONCEALED CONGEALED FEELINGS
IN ALL INNOCENCE HOW COULD THEY BE JUST TOWARDS ME HE WHO LIVETH AMONGST THE GOOD PITY TEACHETH HIM TO LIE
THE WHIZZING OF SO MANY WINGS HOWEVER AND THE CROWDING AROUND HIS HEAD WAS SO GREAT THAT HE SHUT HIS EYES AND VERILY THERE CAME DOWN UPON HIM AS IT WERE A CLOUD LIKE A CLOUD OF ARROWS WHICH POURETH UPON A NEW ENEMY BUT BEHOLD
AND IN THE ROARING AND WHISTLING AND WHIZZING THE COFFIN BURST UP AND SPOUTED OUT A THOUSAND PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND A THOUSAND CARICATURES OF CHILDREN ANGELS OWLS FOOLS AND
LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS THOU GREAT STAR SPAKE HE AS HE HAD SPOKEN ONCE BEFORE THOU DEEP EYE OF HAPPINESS
O ETERNITY FOUR IF EVER I HAVE DRUNK A FULL DRAUGHT OF THE FOAMING SPICE AND CONFECTION BOWL IN WHICH ALL THINGS ARE WELL MIXED IF EVER MY HAND HATH MINGLED THE FURTHEST WITH THE NEAREST
AND UNTO THOSE OF WHOM THE HUNCHBACK WAS THE MOUTHPIECE AND ADVOCATE THEN DID HE TURN TO HIS DISCIPLES IN PROFOUND DEJECTION AND SAID
IN DARKENED ROOMS FOR SPIRITS TO COME TO HIM AND THE SPIRIT RUNNETH AWAY ENTIRELY OR THEY LISTEN TO AN OLD ROVING HOWL AND GROWL PIPER
THUS DID THE WORLD ONCE SEEM TO ME THUS ONCE ON A TIME DID I ALSO CAST MY FANCY BEYOND MAN LIKE ALL BACKWORLDSMEN BEYOND MAN FORSOOTH AH YE BRETHREN
UNLESS THE WILL SHOULD AT LAST DELIVER ITSELF AND WILLING BECOME NON WILLING BUT YE KNOW MY BRETHREN THIS FABULOUS SONG OF MADNESS AWAY FROM THOSE FABULOUS SONGS DID I LEAD YOU WHEN I TAUGHT YOU
AND EARTH WILL I AGAIN BECOME TO HAVE REST IN HER THAT BORE ME VERILY A GOAL HAD ZARATHUSTRA HE THREW HIS BALL NOW BE YE FRIENDS THE HEIRS OF MY GOAL
YEA AN ATTEMPT HATH MAN BEEN ALAS MUCH IGNORANCE AND ERROR HATH BECOME EMBODIED IN US NOT ONLY THE RATIONALITY OF MILLENNIUMS

INTO THUS WOULD I HAVE IT THAT ONLY DO I CALL REDEMPTION WILL SO IS THE EMANCIPATOR AND JOY BRINGER CALLED THUS HAVE I TAUGHT YOU MY FRIENDS
THAT WAS ALWAYS COUNTER TO MY TASTE RATHER DID I QUESTION AND TEST THE WAYS THEMSELVES A TESTING AND A QUESTIONING HATH BEEN ALL MY TRAVELLING AND VERILY
HOW COULD HE EVER DIE AT THE RIGHT TIME WOULD THAT HE MIGHT NEVER BE BORN THUS DO I ADVISE THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES BUT EVEN THE SUPERFLUOUS ONES MAKE MUCH ADO ABOUT THEIR DEATH
AND ART THOU THIRSTY I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING BUT THY MOUTH WOULD NOT LIKE IT TO DRINK OH THAT CURSED NIMBLE SUPPLE SERPENT AND LURKING WITCH WHERE ART THOU GONE
UNTIL AT LAST THOU ALONE SATTEST THIRSTY AMONGST THE DRUNKEN ONES AND WAILEDST NIGHTLY
WHOSE FITS OF ILL TEMPER WERE UNDER NO CONTROL AND WHO NEVER WHEN IN THEM CARED WHAT HE SAID TO OUTRAGE THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER THE TEMPTATION TO SIN AS YOU CALL IT LAY NOT IN MY PERSUASIONS HALF SO MUCH AS IN YOUR JEALOUS ANGER TOWARD YOUR HUSBAND
SHE SPOKE IN A LOW TONE EMBARRASSMENT MAKES COWARDS OF US AND MISTER CARLYLE REPEATED IT AFTER HER HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING THAN SHE DID
SOME ONE CAME PANTING AND TEARING ALONG THE PATH LEADING FROM THE COTTAGE IT WAS THORN HIS APPEARANCE STARTLED ME I HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN SHOW MORE UTTER TERROR HIS FACE WAS LIVID HIS EYES SEEMED STARTING AND HIS LIPS WERE DRAWN BACK FROM HIS TEETH
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
I CAME BACK TO THE CHAIR AND COVERED MY HEAD OVER HOPING SOME ONE WOULD COME UP I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CORNELIA BUT WHAT MADE YOU NERVOUS OH I WAS VERY FOOLISH I KEPT THINKING OF FRIGHTFUL THINGS THEY WOULD COME INTO MY MIND DO NOT BLAME ME ARCHIBALD THIS IS THE ROOM PAPA DIED IN
WE HAD BETTER TAKE A CAB MY DEAR WITH THAT THE MAN I WAS TALKING TO SWUNG OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS CAB AND SHE GOT IN SUCH A FAIR YOUNG LADY SHE WAS I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM
DON'T I KNOW IT HAVE I NOT SAID SO SHE SHARPLY INTERRUPTED AND THEN SHE SAT STRIVING TO CALM HERSELF CLASPING TOGETHER HER SHAKING HANDS WELL IF YOU WILL PERSIST IN THIS PERVERSE RESOLUTION I CANNOT MEND IT
SEND IN MISS CARLYLE FIRST WAS THE ANSWER WHAT IS IT CORNELIA AH YOU MAY WELL ASK WHAT SAYING THIS MORNING THAT YOU COULD NOT DINE AT SIX AS USUAL AND THEN MARCHING OFF AND NEVER FIXING THE HOUR
BUT HAPPENING TO GLANCE INTO THE STREET THERE I SAW THE MAN AGAIN STANDING OPPOSITE AND RECONNOITERING THE HOUSE I HAD GONE HOME HUNGRY BUT THIS TOOK ALL MY HUNGER AWAY FROM ME I OPENED THE BOX WHERE I KEPT MY DISGUISE
AND SHE WILL BE AS ANXIOUS TO SHIELD YOU FROM DANGER AS I CAN BE IS IT CRIED THE RELIEVED RICHARD CAN'T YOU MAKE HER KEEP OUT HE CONTINUED HIS TEETH STILL CHATTERING
CHAPTER SIX RICHARD HARE THE YOUNGER
BETHEL ALSO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IT WAS NOT BETHEL WHO DID IT INTERRUPTED RICHARD
LADY ISABEL EXCITED BEYOND ALL SELF CONTROL SLIPPED THE BOLT OF THE DOOR AND HALF LEANING AGAINST IT HALF LEANING AT HIS FEET HELD UP HER HAND IN SUPPLICATION FRANCIS HAVE YOU ANY CONSIDERATION LEFT FOR ME ANY IN THE WORLD
YOU HERE CORNELIA THAT WAS KIND HOW ARE YOU ISABEL THIS IS MY SISTER LADY ISABEL PUT FORTH HER HAND AND MISS CARLYLE CONDESCENDED TO TOUCH THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS
PROCEEDING TO THE WINDOW ONE OF THOSE OPENING TO THE GROUND HE THREW ASIDE THE HALF OF THE WARM CRIMSON CURTAIN IT ALL LOOKED DULL AND DARK OUTSIDE MISTER CARLYLE COULD SEE LITTLE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS
MISS CARLYLE LOOKED AT LADY ISABEL WAITING OF COURSE FOR HER TO GIVE THEM ISABEL WAS SILENT WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HAD NEVER GIVEN SUCH AN ORDER IN HER LIFE TOTALLY IGNORANT WAS SHE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF A HOUSEHOLD AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO SUGGEST A FEW POUNDS OF MEAT OR A WHOLE COW
AND SHE TOOK IT INDOORS SHUTTING ME OUT I DID NOT GO AWAY
IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM
RICHARD HARE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MY PROOFS OF HIS GUILT MISTER CARLYLE I COULD BRING NONE AGAINST HIM NO POSITIVE ONES
ITS POSITION HAD BEEN CHANGED IN SOME LATE ALTERATIONS TO THE HOUSE YOUR ROOMS SHALL BE CHANGED TO MORROW ISABEL NO LET US REMAIN IN THESE I SHALL LIKE TO FEEL THAT PAPA WAS ONCE THEIR OCCUPANT I WON'T GET NERVOUS AGAIN
IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
YOU SEE I APPEAL TO YOU IN ALL MY TROUBLES SHE ADDED LIKE I AND ANNE USED TO DO WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN IT MAY BE QUESTIONED IF MISTER CARLYLE HEARD THE LAST REMARK HE HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS IN THOUGHT HAVE YOU TOLD ME ALL HE ASKED PRESENTLY LIFTING THEM
AS SHE RAISED IT HE SAW THAT IT WAS FLUSHED AND AGITATED THAT HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND HER FRAME WAS TREMBLING WHAT IS THE MATTER HE HASTILY ASKED I GOT NERVOUS AFTER MARVEL WENT SHE WHISPERED LAYING HOLD OF HIM AS IF FOR PROTECTION FROM TERROR
DUCK HIM THE POND BE CLOSE AT HAND LET'S GIVE HIM A TASTE OF HIS DESERVINGS
SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF PLUNGED INTO A YAWNING ABYSS OF HORROR FROM WHICH THERE WAS NEVER MORE ANY ESCAPE NEVER MORE NEVER MORE THE VERY INSTANT THE VERY NIGHT OF HER DEPARTURE SHE AWOKE TO WHAT SHE HAD DONE THE GUILT
SHOOK HANDS WITH AFY AND LEFT A FINE UPRIGHT MAN HE WAS NEARLY AS TALL AS YOU SIR BUT VERY SLIM THOSE SOLDIERS ALWAYS CARRY THEMSELVES WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WAS A SOLDIER QUICKLY REJOINED MISTER CARLYLE AFY TOLD ME SO
BUT MISS CARLYLE RETIRED TO BED THE SMOKE TO WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH HAD MADE HER HEAD ACHE AND HER EYES SMART ABOUT ELEVEN THEY WISHED MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT AND DEPARTED BUT MISTER DILL IN OBEDIENCE TO A NOD FROM HIS SUPERIOR REMAINED
DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE
NO DID THEY WHAT A PACK OF IDIOTS I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF HER CARLYLE SINCE THAT UNFORTUNATE NIGHT IF SHE WENT AFTER ANYBODY IT WAS AFTER THORN WAS THE MAN GOOD LOOKING I SUPPOSE THE WORLD WOULD CALL HIM SO
I SAW BY THE DATE THAT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TWO WHICH YOU RECEIVED ON THE MORNING OF YOUR DEPARTURE IT CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT THE DIVORCE WAS PRONOUNCED SHE SPOKE SO QUIETLY SO APPARENTLY WITHOUT FEELING OR PASSION THAT SIR FRANCIS WAS AGREEABLY ASTONISHED
BESIDES I SHOULD NOT CHOOSE FOR THE OLD MAN'S FUNERAL TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT ME
AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
I SHALL FIX MYSELF IN SOME OTHER BIG TOWN FAR AWAY FROM LONDON LIVERPOOL OR MANCHESTER PERHAPS AND SEE WHAT EMPLOYMENT I CAN GET INTO
TO HEAR YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE SCRAPE THE BENCH HAVE GOT INTO IS YOURS NOW IT'S NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER AND I TELL YOU ARCHIBALD I'LL HEAR WHAT IT IS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU AND BARBARA DO WITH A SECRET BETWEEN YOU MISTER CARLYLE KNEW HER AND HER RESOLUTE EXPRESSION WELL
UP STARTED MISS CORNY SHE COULD NOT STAND THAT ARE YOU AWARE LADY ISABEL THAT AN ORDER SUCH AS THAT WOULD ONLY PUZZLE THE BUTCHER SHALL I GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS FOR TO DAY THE FISHMONGER WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY OH I WISH YOU WOULD
IF HE CAN HAVE THAT SUM MAMMA HAS SENT ME TO YOU SHE HAS NOT THE MONEY BY HER AND SHE DARE NOT ASK PAPA FOR IT AS IT IS FOR RICHARD SHE BADE ME SAY THAT IF YOU WILL KINDLY OBLIGE HER WITH THE MONEY TO DAY SHE WILL ARRANGE WITH YOU ABOUT THE REPAYMENT
AND SHE WOULD SET TO WORK LIKE A FERRET AND NEVER STOP UNTIL IT WAS UNEARTHED MISTER CARLYLE BENT FORWARD AND SPOKE IN A WHISPER I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU WISH CORNELIA BUT IT IS NOT A PLEASANT THING TO HEAR RICHARD HARE HAS RETURNED
I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
BUT EVEN AS SHE SPOKE HER ACTIONS BELIED HER WORDS MISTER CARLYLE HAD GONE TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT AND SHE FLEW CLOSE UP TO HIM COWERING BEHIND HIM SHALL YOU BE GONE VERY LONG ARCHIBALD SHE WHISPERED NOT MORE THAN AN HOUR HE ANSWERED
YES YES BUT RICHARD
I CAN'T HELP IT IT WAS BORN WITH ME AND WILL GO WITH ME TO MY GRAVE WHAT WOULD MY WORD HAVE AVAILED THAT IT WAS THORN WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY TO CORROBORATE IT AND THE DISCHARGED GUN MINE WAS A DAMNATORY PROOF AGAINST ME
A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
WHO IS HE LIKE ISABEL MY HANDSOME SELF WERE HE LIKE YOU IN SPIRIT I WOULD PRAY THAT HE MIGHT DIE ERE HE COULD SPEAK OR THINK SHE BURST FORTH AND THEN REMEMBERING THE RESOLUTION MARKED OUT FOR HERSELF SUBSIDED
WAS LEFT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN CORNELIA AND ARCHIBALD ARCHIBALD WAS NO BLOOD RELATION TO HIM BUT HE LOVED THE OPEN HEARTED BOY BETTER THAN HIS NIECE CORNELIA OF MISTER CARLYLE'S PROPERTY A SMALL PORTION ONLY WAS BEQUEATHED TO HIS DAUGHTER
CARLYLE I SEE YOU DON'T BELIEVE MY STORY
MISTER CARLYLE SAT IN A BROWN STUDY
THAT WAS THE SHOT THAT KILLED HALLIJOHN THERE WAS A PAUSE MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED KEENLY AT RICHARD THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT
MISS CARLYLE'S ROOMS A FINE ROW WE HAVE HAD IN THE TOWN JOYCE THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE HEARD OF IT MA'AM SERVED HIM RIGHT IF THEY HAD LET HIM DROWN BILL WHITE SQUIRE PINNER'S PLOWMAN CALLED IN HERE AND TOLD US THE NEWS HE'D HAVE BURST WITH IT IF HE HADN'T I EXPECT
RICHARD HARE'S SHORT INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER HAD SOON TERMINATED IT LASTED BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BOTH DREADING INTERRUPTIONS FROM THE SERVANTS AND WITH A HUNDRED POUNDS IN HIS POCKET AND DESOLATION IN HIS HEART THE ILL FATED YOUNG MAN ONCE MORE QUITTED HIS CHILDHOOD'S HOME
A GREEN DANK DARK SLIMY SOUR STINKING POND HIS COAT TAILS WERE GONE BY THIS TIME AND SUNDRY RENTS AND DAMAGES APPEARED IN IN ANOTHER USEFUL GARMENT ONE PULLED HIM ANOTHER PUSHED HIM A THIRD SHOOK HIM BY THE COLLAR
AND THAT THE SHORTEST WAY WOULD BE TO HASTEN TO THE INN ON FOOT HE OBJECTED BUT HIS JAWS WERE CHATTERING HIS LIMBS WERE QUAKING SO THEY SEIZED HIM BETWEEN THEM AND MADE OFF BUT NEVER BARGAINED FOR THE MEETING OF MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS PARTY
STUCK HIS PENDENT EYE GLASSES ASTRIDE ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE SIR FRANCIS LEVISON COULD IT BE YES IT ACTUALLY WAS WHAT ON EARTH HAD PUT HIM INTO THAT STATE
WHERE IS PIERRE MILADI ASKED
LAST OUT A WHOLE TEN MONTHS YOU ARE IN EGREGIOUS ERROR COMPLIMENTS THE VERY OPPOSITE TO HONEY AND SWEETNESS HAVE GENERALLY SUPERVENED LONG BEFORE TRY IT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME TWO LETTERS SHE CONTINUED
PERHAPS I DID AND PERHAPS I DIDN'T HALLIJOHN HAD ASKED ME TO LEND HIM MY GUN AND THAT EVENING WHEN I WENT TO SEE AF WHEN I WENT TO SEE SOME ONE NEVER MIND
WAS IT A SUPERNATURAL VISITANT OR WAS IT BUT A DELUSION OF HER OWN EYESIGHT NOT THE LATTER CERTAINLY FOR THE FIGURE WAS NOW EMERGING AGAIN MOTIONING TO HER AS BEFORE
SHE SAT ON FIVE MINUTES LONGER AND THEN LEFT WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE RESUMED HIS READING BUT ANOTHER PAGE OR TWO CONCLUDED THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH MISTER CARLYLE THREW THE BOOK ON THE TABLE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING MADAME THEY WERE PASSING A SPECTACLE SHOP AND MADAME VINE HAD HALTED AT THE DOOR ONE FOOT ON ITS STEP I MUST HAVE MY GLASSES TO BE MENDED IF YOU PLEASE MISS CARLYLE FOLLOWED HER IN
AND HE LOOKED LIKE IT I ONLY SAW HIM ONCE
ON YOUR FAVORING US WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND WE REMAIN SIR MOST FAITHFULLY YOURS MOSS AND GRAB SIR FRANCIS LEVISON BART THE OUTSIDE OF THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED AS THE OTHER F LEVISON ESQUIRE
IT WAS A FATAL STEP YES I WAS A FOOL I THOUGHT I'D WAIT QUIET AND SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL
AND SAW AN INFANT'S CRADLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED HE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOOK AT IT I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE NOW OF AN ANCIENT AND RESPECTED BARONETCY HE RESUMED IN A TONE AS OF APOLOGY FOR HIS PREVIOUS HEARTLESS WORDS
MISS CARLYLE DESCENDED IN THE STARTLING COSTUME THE READER HAS SEEN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND THERE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT MISTER CARLYLE CAME DOWN NEXT AND THEN LADY ISABEL ENTERED IN AN ELEGANT HALF MOURNING DRESS WITH FLOWING BLACK RIBBONS
IF THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT UPSTAIRS HIS APPREHENSIONS WERE GROUNDLESS AND HE ENTERED UNSEEN MISTER CARLYLE'S PART WAS OVER HE LEFT THE POOR BANNED EXILE TO HIS SHORT INTERVIEW WITH HIS HYSTERICAL AND TEARFUL MOTHER RICHARD NEARLY AS HYSTERICAL AS SHE
AND WITH THAT HE BURST OUT CRYING AND GAVE BILL WHITE HALF A CROWN OUT OF HIS POCKET
TABLE HAND BELL THE ONLY BELL YOU GENERALLY MEET WITH IN FRANCE PIERRE ANSWERED IT PUT ME UP A CHANGE OF THINGS SAID HE IN FRENCH I START FOR ENGLAND IN AN HOUR IT IS VERY WELL PIERRE RESPONDED AND DEPARTED TO DO IT
HE HAS BEEN IN LONDON ALL THIS WHILE HALF STARVING WORKING I FEEL ASHAMED TO MENTION IT TO YOU IN A STABLE YARD AND OH ARCHIBALD HE SAYS HE IS INNOCENT MISTER CARLYLE MADE NO REPLY TO THIS HE PROBABLY HAD NO FAITH IN THE ASSERTION
ON RETURNING TO THE SITTING ROOM MISTER CARLYLE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF THE SERVANTS NEGLIGENCE I SENT THEM AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERFLUOUS ENCUMBRANCES HASTILY REPLIED MISS CARLYLE WE HAVE FOUR IN THE HOUSE AND MY LADY HAS BROUGHT A FINE MAID I SEE MAKING FIVE
I HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR SIR INDEED AND AS I NEARED WEST LYNNE I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO IT WAS NO USE IN ME TRYING TO CATCH BARBARA'S ATTENTION
USHERED HER INTO THE PRESENCE OF MISTER CARLYLE AND LEFT HER THE LATTER ROSE IN ASTONISHMENT YOU MUST REGARD ME AS A CLIENT AND PARDON MY INTRUSION SAID BARBARA WITH A FORCED LAUGH TO HIDE HER AGITATION I AM HERE ON THE PART OF MAMMA
AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
WAS THE PROMISE HELD OUT IN REPLY TO THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND THE LAWYER WHO WAS SHORT AND FAT AND COULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED A MAN DOWN HAD IT BEEN TO SAVE HIS LIFE BACKED OUT OF THE MELEE AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ISSUING FORTH CONFUSED THREATENINGS OF THE TERRORS OF THE LAW
AND MOST PEOPLE IN YOUR PLACE WOULD JUMP AT THE PROSPECT OF MY LIVING HERE YOUR WIFE WILL BE MISTRESS I DO NOT INTEND TO TAKE HER HONORS FROM HER BUT I WILL SAVE HER A WORLD OF TROUBLE IN MANAGEMENT BE AS USEFUL TO HER AS A HOUSEKEEPER SHE WILL BE GLAD OF THAT INEXPERIENCED AS SHE IS
SETTLING THE LOGS TO HIS APPARENT SATISFACTION TO SPEAK AND ACT LET THERE BE PLAIN TRUTH BETWEEN US AT THIS INTERVIEW IF THERE NEVER HAS BEEN BEFORE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU NAKED TRUTH UNGLOSSED OVER
I SHOULD HAVE PREMISED THAT I HAVE NOT YET TOLD MAMMA IT IS RICHARD HIMSELF WHO IS HERE BUT THAT HE HAS SENT A MESSENGER TO BEG FOR THIS MONEY WOULD IT BE ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT HER WHY SHOULD YOU NOT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO DO SO THEN I WILL
AFY CAME OUT ALL RESERVE AS SHE COULD BE AT TIMES AND SAID SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE ME THEN THAT I MUST GO BACK HOME WE HAD A FEW WORDS ABOUT IT AND AS WE WERE SPEAKING LOCKSLEY PASSED
WAS HER ICY ANSWER LET'S SEE HOW OLD IS HE NOW HE WAS BORN ON THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST SIR FRANCIS THREW UP HIS ARMS AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF A FIT OF IDLENESS HAD OVERTAKEN HIM THEN ADVANCED TO THE CRADLE AND PULLED DOWN THE CLOTHES
AND MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY HOME AGAIN PONDERING OVER WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE MAGISTRATES MADE A GOOD EVENING OF IT MISTER CARLYLE ENTERTAINED THEM TO SUPPER MUTTON CHOPS AND BREAD AND CHEESE THEY TOOK UP THEIR PIPES FOR ANOTHER WHIFF WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER
MISTER ARCHIBALD REMONSTRATED THE OLD CLERK AS IF THOSE TWO RESPECTED GENTLEMEN WITH THEIR WIVES AND BABIES WOULD COME SNEAKING AFTER THAT FLYAWAY AFY NO REFLECTION ON THEM RETURNED MISTER CARLYLE THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN THREE OR FOUR AND TWENTY A HEAD TALLER THAN EITHER
IT WAS MISTER DILL A LITTLE MEEK LOOKING MAN WITH A BALD HEAD HE WAS ON THE ROLLS HAD BEEN ADMITTED YEARS AND YEARS AGO BUT HE HAD NEVER SET UP FOR HIMSELF PERHAPS HE DEEMED THE POST OF HEAD MANAGER IN THE OFFICE OF CARLYLE AND DAVIDSON
BRAINS HE CERTAINLY HAD BUT THEY WERE NOT SHARP ONES IS MY MOTHER COMING OUT TO ME ASKED RICHARD AFTER A FEW INTERCHANGED SENTENCES WITH MISTER CARLYLE NO YOU ARE TO GO INDOORS
COLD AND STILL LOOKED THE OLD HOUSE IN THE MOONBEAMS NEVER WAS THE MOON BRIGHTER IT LIGHTED THE FAR STRETCHING GARDEN IT ILLUMINATED EVEN THE WEATHERCOCK ALOFT IT SHONE UPON THE PORTICO AND UPON ONE WHO APPEARED IN IT
MISTER CARLYLE ROSE AND LOOKED ON THE SIDE BOARD WHERE IS THE WINE PETER THE SERVANT PUT IT OUT PORT AND SHERRY MISTER CARLYLE DRANK A GLASS AND THEN PROCEEDED TO MIX SOME WINE AND WATER SHALL I MIX SOME FOR YOU CORNELIA HE ASKED
THIS ROOM IS SACRED FROM THE INTRUSION OF STRANGERS WHAT OF RICHARD HE SAYS THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE COTTAGE AT THE TIME THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED THAT THE PERSON WHO REALLY DID IT WAS A MAN OF THE NAME OF THORN WHAT THORN ASKED MISTER CARLYLE
IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
OR TO FURNISHED LODGINGS ARCHIBALD
MY FATHER CALLED AFTER ME TO KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING
BUT HE HASTILY PUT BACK ONE OF HIS HANDS AND HELD HER TIGHTLY IN HIS PROTECTING GRASP MARVEL WAS COMING ALONG THE CORRIDOR IN ANSWER TO THE RING HAVE THE GOODNESS TO LET MISS CARLYLE KNOW THAT I AM NOT COMING DOWN AGAIN TO NIGHT HE SAID YES SIR
I COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THAT DEAD MAN
THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS WHO HAD MOST LOUDLY CRITICIZED THESE BOSSES BEGAN TO CHANGE TOWARD THEM NEWSPAPER EDITORS COLLEGE PRESIDENTS CORPORATION LAWYERS AND BIG BUSINESS MEN ALL ALIKE
WAS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SECRET OR CLANDESTINE MEETING I ALWAYS INSISTED ON GOING OPENLY SOLEMN REFORMERS OF THE TOM FOOL VARIETY WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM
JAKE RIIS ACCOMPANIED ME
BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
AND IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT EYE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNABLE TO SHOOT ACCORDINGLY I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN AND WOULD HAVE TO STOP BOXING
WE PARTED WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT THERE REMAINED SOME WEEKS BEFORE FINAL ACTION COULD BE TAKEN AND THE SENATOR WAS CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO YIELD HIS MOST EFFICIENT ALLIES WERE THE PRETENDED REFORMERS
THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION IN THE MINDS OF HONEST MEN THAT MY PRIME PURPOSE WAS NOT TO ATTACK MISTER PLATT OR ANY ONE ELSE EXCEPT AS A NECESSARY INCIDENT TO SECURING CLEAN AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT IN EACH CASE I DID MY BEST TO PERSUADE MISTER PLATT NOT TO OPPOSE ME
I PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO LOSE MY TEMPER NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID HE WAS MUCH TOO OLD AND PHYSICALLY FEEBLE FOR THERE TO BE ANY POINT OF HONOR IN TAKING UP ANY OF HIS REMARKS AND I MERELY EXPLAINED GOOD HUMOREDLY THAT I HAD MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION WOULD NOT BE RETAINED
UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING HE WOULD BE KEPT AT HIS DUTIES AT WASHINGTON WHILE I WAS IN ALBANY IF I WISHED TO SEE HIM IT GENERALLY HAD TO BE AT HIS HOTEL IN NEW YORK ON SATURDAY AND USUALLY I WOULD GO THERE TO BREAKFAST WITH HIM THE ONE THING I WOULD NOT PERMIT
THE CRUISE DID MAKE A VERY DEEP IMPRESSION ABROAD BOASTING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE DOES NOT IMPRESS FOREIGN NATIONS AT ALL EXCEPT UNFAVORABLY BUT POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT DOES
INSTEAD OF THE HEADING I ACTUALLY DID USE
OR AS HE EXPRESSED IT TRUNDLED A TENDERFOOT AND THOUGH A GOOD HUNTER WHO SHOWED ME MUCH GAME OUR EXPERIENCE TOGETHER WAS NOT HAPPY HE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC AND LIKED TO LIE ABED LATE SO THAT I USUALLY HAD TO GET BREAKFAST AND IN FACT DO MOST OF THE WORK AROUND CAMP
I SUPPOSE THERE MUST BE MANY BIG GAME LIBRARIES IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND POSSIBLY IN ENGLAND MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MINE BUT I HAVE NOT HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS ANY SUCH LIBRARY IN THIS COUNTRY SOME OF THE ORIGINALS GO BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
THEREFORE A GOOD EXECUTIVE UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE MUST TAKE A VERY ACTIVE INTEREST IN GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF LEGISLATION IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING HIS EXECUTIVE DUTIES WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE
SAYING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE POSITION HE HANDED ME THE TELEGRAM THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS A MAN I LIKED
WHY THERE ARE SCORES AND SCORES OF SOLID HISTORIES THE BEST IN THE WORLD WHICH ARE AS ABSORBING AS THE BEST OF ALL THE NOVELS AND OF AS PERMANENT VALUE THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF DARWIN AND HUXLEY AND CARLYLE AND EMERSON AND PARTS OF KANT
SOME OF THE BEST MEN WHO HAVE EVER SERVED UNDER ME IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND IN MY REGIMENT WERE FORMER CLERKS OR FLOOR WALKERS WHY JOHNNY HAYES THE MARATHON VICTOR AND AT ONE TIME WORLD CHAMPION ONE OF MY VALUED FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WAS A FLOOR WALKER IN BLOOMINGDALE'S BIG DEPARTMENT STORE
AND THEN THEY STEAMED BANG INTO THE MONITOR LITTLE GIRL BROTHER DON'T YOU SINK MY MONITOR LITTLE BOY WITHOUT HEEDING AND HURRYING TOWARD THE CLIMAX AND THE TORPEDO WENT AT THE MONITOR
OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
AMONG THE FINCHES ONE OF THE MOST MUSICAL AND PLAINTIVE SONGS IS THAT OF THE BUSH SPARROW I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE BOOKS CALL IT FIELD SPARROW FOR IT DOES NOT DWELL IN THE OPEN FIELDS LIKE THE VESPERFINCH THE SAVANNAH SPARROW
A DOZEN YEARS LATER HAVING IN THE MEANTIME MADE A MARKED SUCCESS IN A BUSINESS CAREER HE BECAME THE TREASURER OF THE NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY MY ACTION IN REGARD TO THE CANALS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OFFICE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICE UNDER ME BY COLONEL PARTRIDGE
THAT OUR FLEET SHOULD FROM TIME TO TIME BE GATHERED IN THE PACIFIC JUST AS FROM TIME TO TIME IT WAS GATHERED IN THE ATLANTIC
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
BUT OF THE BULK OF THE MEN WHO MOST PRIDED THEMSELVES UPON THEIR EDUCATION AND CULTURE WHEN WE BEGAN IN GOOD FAITH TO GRAPPLE WITH THE WRONG AND INJUSTICE OF OUR SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM AND TO HIT AT THE MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRONG
HAVING BEEN A RATHER SICKLY AND AWKWARD BOY I WAS AS A YOUNG MAN AT FIRST BOTH NERVOUS AND DISTRUSTFUL OF MY OWN PROWESS I HAD TO TRAIN MYSELF PAINFULLY AND LABORIOUSLY NOT MERELY AS REGARDS MY BODY BUT AS REGARDS MY SOUL AND SPIRIT
BUT BEING WHOLLY UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING POSITIVE FOR GOOD MY FAVORITE QUOTATION FROM JOSH BILLINGS AGAIN APPLIES IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO BE A HARMLESS DOVE THAN A WISE SERPENT MY DUTY WAS TO COMBINE BOTH IDEALISM AND EFFICIENCY
WHEN THE FLEET RETURNED AFTER ITS SIXTEEN MONTHS VOYAGE AROUND THE WORLD I WENT DOWN TO HAMPTON ROADS TO GREET IT THE DAY WAS WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN O SEVEN LITERALLY ON THE MINUTE THE HOMING BATTLECRAFT CAME INTO VIEW
OF COURSE HE MUST NOT LET HIS DESIRE TAKE THE FORM MERELY OF A DAY DREAM LET HIM DREAM ABOUT BEING A FEARLESS MAN AND THE MORE HE DREAMS THE BETTER HE WILL BE ALWAYS PROVIDED HE DOES HIS BEST TO REALIZE THE DREAM IN PRACTICE
WE WERE OUT OF COMMUNICATION WITH A CABLE STATION FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT
DESIRING TO AVOID EVERY POSSIBILITY OF TROUBLE OR MISUNDERSTANDING I WROTE TO HIM LAST JUNE EXPLAINING FULLY THE CHARACTER OF OUR MEN WHICH THEY HAVE SO WELL LIVED UP TO
BECAUSE JAPAN KNEW MY SINCERE FRIENDSHIP AND ADMIRATION FOR HER
WHILE IN THE WHITE HOUSE I ALWAYS TRIED TO GET A COUPLE OF HOURS EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOONS SOMETIMES TENNIS MORE OFTEN RIDING OR ELSE A ROUGH CROSS COUNTRY WALK PERHAPS DOWN ROCK CREEK WHICH WAS THEN AS WILD AS A STREAM IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE VIRGINIA SIDE ALONG THE POTOMAC
ON THE FLAGSHIP OF THE ADMIRAL I SPOKE TO THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN AS FOLLOWS ADMIRAL SPERRY OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE BATTLE FLEET OVER A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE YOU STEAMED OUT OF THIS HARBOR AND OVER THE WORLD'S RIM
SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
PERSONALLY THE BOOKS BY WHICH I HAVE PROFITED INFINITELY MORE THAN BY ANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN THOSE IN WHICH PROFIT WAS A BY PRODUCT OF THE PLEASURE THAT IS I READ THEM BECAUSE I ENJOYED THEM BECAUSE I LIKED READING THEM
HAVE SHOWN YOURSELVES THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE AMBASSADORS AND HERALDS OF PEACE WHEREVER YOU HAVE LANDED YOU HAVE BORNE YOURSELVES SO AS TO MAKE US AT HOME PROUD OF BEING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
WITH SCANT REGARD TO HIS OWN PERSONAL MERITS PERHAPS OUR MOST CHERISHED POSSESSIONS ARE A REMINGTON BRONZE THE BRONCO BUSTER GIVEN ME BY MY MEN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS MUSTERED OUT
THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS DID NOT PERMIT TWO OR THREE THOUSAND SAILORS TO REMAIN ON SHORE BUT THE AMPLE LANDINGS PERMITTED THEM TO BE HANDLED NIGHT AND DAY WITH PERFECT ORDER AND SAFETY
MOST OF THEM MY OPEN OR COVERT ENEMIES WHO LOUDLY INSISTED THAT I MUST MAKE AN OPEN FIGHT ON THE SENATOR HIMSELF AND ON THE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION THIS WAS WHAT HE WISHED FOR AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO WAY OF UPSETTING HIM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
BUT SHORTLY BEFORE THE FLEET STARTED I WENT IN THE GOVERNMENT YACHT MAYFLOWER TO INSPECT THE TARGET PRACTICE OFF PROVINCETOWN I WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO TORPEDO BOAT DESTROYERS IN CHARGE OF A COUPLE OF NAVAL LIEUTENANTS THOROUGH GAMECOCKS
WHEN I WAS IN COMPANY WITH ADMIRAL EVANS AND CAPTAIN COWLES AND AGAIN ON THE SYLPH AND ON THE MAYFLOWER WE ALSO DINED AS GUESTS OF THE CREW WHEN WE FINISHED OUR TRIP ON THE LOUISIANA I MADE A SHORT SPEECH TO THE ASSEMBLED CREW
I FOUND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ELECT MISTER WOODRUFF WHO HAD ALSO BEEN ASKED TO COME THE SENATOR INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS GLAD TO SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE A MOST ADMIRABLE MAN AS SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AS HE HAD JUST RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN WHOM HE NAMED
AFTER STUDYING THE REPORT OF COUNSEL IN THIS CASE AND THE TESTIMONY TAKEN BY THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION WOULD DISAGREE WITH THEM AS TO THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE REMEDY WAS A THOROUGH CHANGE IN THE METHODS AND MANAGEMENT
LEONARD WOOD'S SON I FOUND ATTRIBUTED THE PATERNITY OF ALL OF THOSE NOT OF HIS OWN FAMILY TO ME ONCE WE WERE TAKING THE CHILDREN ACROSS ROCK CREEK ON A FALLEN TREE
THIS WAS FURTHER REDUCED TO TEN MILES EACH MONTH WHICH IS THE PRESENT TEST AND THERE IS DANGER LEST EVEN THIS UTTERLY INSUFFICIENT TEST BE ABOLISHED I ENCLOSE A COPY OF A RECENT LETTER TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WHICH WILL SHOW OUR PRESENT DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND THE WORSE CONDITION INTO WHICH WE ARE SLIPPING BACK
OF COURSE BOXING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN THE ARMY AND NAVY I WAS FIRST DRAWN TO TWO NAVAL CHAPLAINS FATHERS CHIDWICK AND RAINEY BY FINDING THAT EACH OF THEM HAD BOUGHT HALF A DOZEN SETS OF BOXING GLOVES AND ENCOURAGED THEIR CREWS IN BOXING
THE DAY AFTER THE ARRIVAL ONE OF OUR CAPTAINS NOTICED A MEMBER OF HIS CREW TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP ON A BENCH IN THE PARK HE HAD FIXED ABOVE HIS HEAD A LARGE PAPER WITH SOME LINES EVIDENTLY DESIGNED TO FORESTALL ANY QUESTIONS FROM FRIENDLY WOULD BE HOSTS
THE YANKTON REMAINED BEHIND TO KEEP UP COMMUNICATION FOR A FEW DAYS AND YESTERDAY SHE TRANSMITTED THE EMPEROR'S TELEGRAM TO YOU WHICH WAS SENT IN REPLY TO YOUR MESSAGE THROUGH OUR AMBASSADOR AFTER THE SAILING OF THE FLEET
FOR THEY WERE VIGOROUS YOUNG MEN WHO LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF TREATING A FIFTY MILE WALK AS OVER FATIGUING WELL THE NAVY DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS REBUKED THEM AND MADE THEM TAKE THE WALK OVER AGAIN IN THREE DAYS ON THE GROUND THAT TAKING IT IN ONE DAY DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS
YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
THEY OFTEN WENT BAREFOOT ESPECIALLY DURING THE MANY HOURS PASSED IN VARIOUS ENTHRALLING PURSUITS ALONG AND IN THE WATERS OF THE BAY THEY SWAM THEY TRAMPED THEY BOATED
TO THE FACT THAT THE MACHINE POLITICIANS WERE NOT GIVING THEM THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WISHED AS THIS WAKING UP GREW MORE GENERAL NOT MERELY IN NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER ONE STATE BUT THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE NATION THE POWER OF THE BOSSES WANED
TEN DAYS LATER AT SAGAMORE HILL I WAS AMONG MY OWN BIRDS AND WAS MUCH INTERESTED AS I LISTENED TO AND LOOKED AT THEM IN REMEMBERING THE NOTES AND ACTIONS OF THE BIRDS I HAD SEEN IN ENGLAND
NOT ANTAGONISTIC DURING THE PRESIDENCY ALL OF US BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN BECAME CLOSE FRIENDS WITH MANY OF THE SAILOR MEN THE FOUR BEARERS OF THE VASE TO MISSUS ROOSEVELT WERE PROMPTLY HAILED AS DELIGHTFUL BIG BROTHERS BY OUR TWO SMALLEST BOYS
HE SAYS THAT AT THE OUTSET ALMOST EVERY MAN IS FRIGHTENED WHEN HE GOES INTO ACTION
IT IS ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY THAT I MEET ANY ONE WHO CARES FOR ANY OF THESE BOOKS ON THE OTHER HAND I EXPECT TO FIND MANY FRIENDS WHO WILL TURN NATURALLY TO SOME OF THE OLD OR THE NEW BOOKS OF POETRY OR ROMANCE
AND EVERY OFFICER AND EVERY ENLISTED MAN IN THE TORPEDO BOAT FLOTILLA HAS THE RIGHT TO FEEL THAT HE HAS RENDERED DISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY AND THEREFORE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND I WISH I COULD THANK EACH OF THEM PERSONALLY
WE ARE SURE THAT APART FROM INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING FLEET THIS IS THE AIM WHICH MISTER ROOSEVELT HAS IN MIND HE HAS A POLICY WHICH PROJECTS ITSELF FAR INTO THE FUTURE
NIGHT HERON RED TAILED HAWK YELLOW BILLED CUCKOO KINGFISHER FLICKER HUMMING BIRD SWIFT MEADOW LARK RED WINGED BLACKBIRD SHARP TAILED FINCH
IT WAS WHILE HUNTING IN VAIN FOR A GROUSE THAT I CAME ON THE BEAR AND KILLED IT AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WHEN I REACHED THE SETTLEMENT AND WENT INTO THE STORE THE STOREKEEPER IDENTIFIED ME BY REMARKING YOU'RE THE TENDERFOOT THAT OLD HANK WAS TRUNDLING AIN'T YOU
WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
BUT IT IS AN ENTIRE MISREADING OF IT TO SUPPOSE THAT IT IS AIMED NARROWLY AND DEFINITELY AT ANY SINGLE POWER I FIRST DIRECTED THE FLEET OF SIXTEEN BATTLESHIPS TO GO ROUND THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN TO SAN FRANCISCO
OF COURSE THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF EACH IMPLIES MUCH PREVIOUS STUDY OR TRAINING BUT IN NO ONE OF THEM IS SUCCESS TO BE ATTAINED SAVE BY THE ALTOGETHER EXCEPTIONAL MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE SOMETHING ADDITIONAL WHICH THE ORDINARY MAN DOES NOT HAVE
MIKE IS A DEVOTED TEMPERANCE MAN AND CAN BE RELIED UPON FOR EVERY MOVEMENT IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP
WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I FOUND AND JACOB RIIS WILL BACK ME UP IN THIS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A BOXING CLUB IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD ALWAYS TENDED TO DO AWAY WITH KNIFING AND GUN FIGHTING AMONG THE YOUNG FELLOWS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN IN MURDEROUS GANGS
LAW BOOKS MEDICAL BOOKS COOKERY BOOKS AND THE LIKE I AM NOT SPEAKING OF THESE FOR THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY BOOKS AT ALL THEY COME IN THE CATEGORY OF TIME TABLES TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES AND OTHER USEFUL AGENCIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE
IN THE THREE HOUSES THERE WERE AT ONE TIME SIXTEEN OF THESE SMALL COUSINS ALL TOLD AND ONCE WE RANGED THEM IN ORDER OF SIZE AND TOOK THEIR PHOTOGRAPH THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF SUCCESS IN LIFE WORTH HAVING
SEVEN SEA MILES WITHOUT GLASSES WHILE THE HARTFORD A BLACK SHIP WAS NEVER DISCOVERED AT ALL THOUGH SHE PASSED WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF I HAVE FOR YEARS WHILE A MEMBER OF THE GENERAL BOARD
AS IN EVERY HOUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT APPEAL TO THE HOUSEHOLDER BECAUSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATIONS BUT WHICH WOULD NOT MEAN MUCH TO OTHERS NATURALLY ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND FILLED OTHER POSITIONS ACCUMULATES SUCH THINGS
AND THE UPHOLDER OF WHAT IS GOOD IN OLD THINGS ALL NEED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO KNOW HUMAN NATURE TO KNOW THE NEEDS OF THE HUMAN SOUL AND THEY WILL FIND THIS NATURE AND THESE NEEDS SET FORTH AS NOWHERE ELSE BY THE GREAT IMAGINATIVE WRITERS
IN ORDER TO AVOID THE DANGER OF BEING SELECTED OUT WE HAVE NO SUCH SERVICE OPINION AND IT IS NOT IN PROCESS OF FORMATION ON THE CONTRARY IT IS KNOWN THAT THE PRINCIPAL DIGNITARIES UNANIMOUSLY ADVISED THE SECRETARY TO ABANDON ALL PHYSICAL TESTS
THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
THE ONLY ONLOOKERS BEING THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAITHFUL FAMILIES MY TWO PONIES WERE THE ONLY OCCUPANTS OF MY STABLE EXCEPT A CART HORSE MY WIFE AND I RODE AND DROVE THEM AND THEY WERE USED FOR HOUSEHOLD ERRANDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN AND FOR TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK THEY SERVED ME AS POLO PONIES
THE SHIP CONCERNED MERELY FALLING OUT OF COLUMN FOR A FEW HOURS AND WHEN THE JOB WAS DONE STEAMING AT SPEED UNTIL SHE REGAINED HER POSITION
AND APPEALING DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM THE MACHINE FOR INSTANCE HAD A MORE OR LESS STRONG CONTROL OVER THE GREAT BULK OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT IN THE LAST RESORT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THESE LEGISLATORS HAD A STILL GREATER CONTROL OVER THEM
AND I ENVY AND RESPECT THE MEN WHO ARE NATURALLY FEARLESS BUT IT IS A GOOD THING TO REMEMBER THAT THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ENJOY THIS ADVANTAGE CAN NEVERTHELESS STAND BESIDE THE MAN WHO DOES AND CAN DO HIS DUTY WITH THE LIKE EFFICIENCY IF HE CHOOSES TO
AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
BUT THE NAVAL OFFICERS FEEL NO SUCH NECESSITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR MEN DO NOT HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFICIENCY BY PRACTICE MARCHES AND THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE TO DO A STUNT THAT WILL SHOW UP THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEFFICIENCY IN THE MATTER
AND THAT ITS PRESENCE IN ONE OCEAN WAS NO MORE TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MARK OF HOSTILITY TO ANY ASIATIC POWER THAN ITS PRESENCE IN THE ATLANTIC WAS TO BE ACCEPTED AS A MARK OF HOSTILITY TO ANY EUROPEAN POWER I DETERMINED ON THE MOVE
TO GET MISTER PLATT AND THE OTHER HEADS OF THE MACHINE TO ACCEPT MY VIEWS AND TO CONVINCE THEM BY REPEATED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS RIGHT I NEVER WANTONLY ANTAGONIZED OR HUMILIATED THEM I DID NOT WISH TO HUMILIATE THEM OR TO SEEM VICTORIOUS OVER THEM
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SUCCESS OR RATHER TWO KINDS OF ABILITY DISPLAYED IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCCESS THERE IS FIRST THE SUCCESS EITHER IN BIG THINGS OR SMALL THINGS WHICH COMES TO THE MAN WHO HAS IN HIM THE NATURAL POWER TO DO WHAT NO ONE ELSE CAN DO
WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET PRECISELY AS I TOOK PANAMA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE CABINET A COUNCIL OF WAR NEVER FIGHTS AND IN A CRISIS THE DUTY OF A LEADER IS TO LEAD
FROM THENCE I ORDERED THEM TO NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA THEN TO THE PHILIPPINES CHINA AND JAPAN AND HOME THROUGH SUEZ THEY STOPPED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO HELP THE SUFFERERS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AT MESSINA BY THE WAY
BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
MISTER AMBASSADOR MISTER AMBASSADOR YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN OFF YOUR GLOVES TO WHICH HE PROMPTLY RESPONDED I THINK I WILL LEAVE THEM ON WE MIGHT MEET LADIES WE LIKED ROCK CREEK FOR THESE WALKS BECAUSE WE COULD DO SO MUCH SCRAMBLING AND CLIMBING ALONG THE CLIFFS
POLO IS A GOOD GAME INFINITELY BETTER FOR VIGOROUS MEN THAN TENNIS OR GOLF OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND THERE IS ALL THE FUN OF FOOTBALL WITH THE HORSE THROWN IN
WE EVEN FIND THE CURVED LINES OF THE MAYA T WHICH GIVE
THEY POSSESSED VARIOUS MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES THEY WERE VERY PROBABLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LATHE
THE TABLE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH SUBSTANTIAL MEATS ESPECIALLY GAME AMONG WHICH THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS THE TURKEY ALSO THERE WERE FOUND VERY DELICIOUS VEGETABLES AND FRUITS OF EVERY VARIETY NATIVE TO THE CONTINENT
THAT THE SPANISH PRIESTS DECLARED THE DEVIL HAD GIVEN THEM A BOGUS IMITATION OF CHRISTIANITY TO DESTROY THEIR SOULS THE DEVIL SAID THEY STOLE ALL HE COULD THEY HAD CONFESSIONS ABSOLUTION OF SINS AND BAPTISM
IN THE ALPHABETICAL TABLE WHICH WE HEREWITH APPEND WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE SIGN V OR VAU OR F BY THE MAYA SIGN FOR U
RANA A GOD OF THE TOLTECS RAYMI THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE SUN OF THE PERUVIANS AND RAYAM A GOD OF YEMEN
A VERY FAIR REPRESENTATION OF AN R LYING UPON ITS FACE IS IT NOT ANOTHER REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT THE P IN BOTH MAYA AND PHOENICIAN SHOULD CONTAIN THIS SINGULAR SIGN
WAS CREATED AS A RESERVOIR FOR THE WATERS OF THE NILE IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET DEEP WITH SUBTERRANEAN CHANNELS FLOOD GATES LOCKS AND DAMS BY WHICH THE WILDERNESS WAS REDEEMED FROM STERILITY
CAN ANY ONE READ THESE DETAILS AND DECLARE PLATO'S DESCRIPTION OF ATLANTIS TO BE FABULOUS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE TELLS US OF THE ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF GOLD AND SILVER POSSESSED BY THE PEOPLE
SEA SHELLS FROM THE GULF PEARLS FROM THE ATLANTIC AND OBSIDIAN FROM MEXICO HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR MOUNDS THE ANTIQUITY OF THEIR WORKS IS NOW GENERALLY CONCEDED FROM THE RUINS OF NINEVEH AND BABYLON SAYS MISTER GLIDDON
AND MANY AGAIN RESULT FROM THE CASUAL SPELLING OF THE SPANIARDS
WE CAN STILL SEE THE SWARMING MULTITUDES POSSESSED OF ALL THE ARTS OF THE HIGHEST CIVILIZATION PRESSING FORWARD FROM OUT THAT OTHER AND GREATER EMPIRE OF WHICH EVEN THIS WONDERWORKING NILE LAND IS BUT A FAINT AND IMPERFECT COPY
AND IN THIS UNIVERSAL EMPIRE SENOR LOPEZ MUST FIND AN EXPLANATION OF THE SIMILARITY WHICH AS WE SHALL SHOW EXISTS BETWEEN THE SPEECH OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN PACIFIC COAST ON THE ONE HAND AND THE SPEECH OF GAUL IRELAND
THE MANUSCRIPT CONTAINS OVER TWO THOUSAND PAGES AND DOCTOR FALB HAS DEVOTED TO IT TEN YEARS OF STUDY A WORK FROM SUCH A SOURCE UPON SO CURIOUS AND IMPORTANT A SUBJECT WILL BE LOOKED FOR WITH GREAT INTEREST
THEY CULTIVATED FRUITS THEY USED THE SIGN OF THE CROSS EXTENSIVELY THEY CUT AND ENGRAVED PRECIOUS STONES AMONG THEIR CARVINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE LION BOTH ANIMALS NOT KNOWN IN AMERICA THE FORMS OF SEPULTURE
THEY ALSO FORMED THE BASE OF THE DARK HAIRED POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND THEY SEEM TO HAVE RACE AFFINITIES WITH THE BERBERS ON THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF AFRICA DOCTOR BODICHON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS A SURGEON IN ALGIERS SAYS
IN THE OLDEST KNOWN FORM OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET THAT FOUND ON THE MOAB STONE WE FIND IN THE SAME WAY BUT ONE SIGN TO EXPRESS THE D AND T D DOES NOT OCCUR ON THE ETRUSCAN MONUMENTS T BEING USED IN ITS PLACE
WHEN TSABAISIN PLANET WORSHIP WAS THE RELIGION OF ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY THAT WAS YET INHABITED SIR HENRY RAWLINSON SAYS SO GREAT IS THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE OF WRITING AS IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PURSUED IN CHALDEA
THE BASE OF THESE TREASURE HOUSES IS CIRCULAR AND THE COVERING OF A DOME SHAPE IT DOES NOT HOWEVER FORM AN ARCH BUT COURSES OF STONE ARE LAID HORIZONTALLY OVER ONE ANOTHER IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH COURSE PROJECTS BEYOND THE ONE BELOW IT
IN PERFECT PRESERVATION NEVERTHELESS THE SKELETONS DEPOSITED IN OUR INDIAN MOUNDS FROM THE LAKES TO THE GULF ARE CRUMBLING INTO DUST THROUGH AGE ALONE ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CIVILIZED OR SEMI CIVILIZED MAN HAS DWELT ON THE WESTERN CONTINENT FROM A VAST ANTIQUITY
SHORT'S NORTH AMERICANS OF ANTIQUITY
IN PERU WE FIND VASES WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME STYLE OF FACE
OBTAINED FROM THE MOUNDS ARE THE STONE TUBES THEY ARE ALL CARVED FROM FINE GRAINED MATERIALS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A POLISH AND BEING MADE ORNAMENTAL AS WELL AS USEFUL
THE SLOPING JAMBS THE WINDOW CORNICE THE POLYGONAL MASONRY AND OTHER FORMS SO CLOSELY RESEMBLE WHAT IS FOUND IN THE OLD PELASGIC CITIES OF GREECE AND ITALY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE MAY BE SOME RELATION BETWEEN THEM
NEW AMERICAN CYCLOPAEDIA ART BASQUES ACCORDING TO PAUL BROCA THEIR LANGUAGE STANDS QUITE ALONE OR HAS MERE ANALOGIES WITH THE AMERICAN TYPE
RUINS WHICH AT FIRST MAKE NO IMPRESSION SO COMPLETE IS THEIR DILAPIDATION HE ASSERTS THE GREAT ANTIQUITY OF THESE RUINS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE VERY HIGHWAYS OF THE ANCIENT CITY TO BE COMPOSED OF BROKEN BRICKS AND POTTERY THE DEBRIS LEFT BY EARLIER POPULATIONS
SO DID THE PHOENICIANS SLOPE THEIR LETTERS TO THE LEFT HENCE THE MAYA SIGN
BY ATLANTEANS DOCTOR BODICHON REFERS TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE BARBARY STATES THAT BEING ONE OF THE NAMES BY WHICH THEY WERE KNOWN TO THE GREEKS AND ROMANS HE ADDS THE ATLANTEANS AMONG THE ANCIENTS PASSED FOR THE FAVORITE CHILDREN OF NEPTUNE
OR EVEN OF ANY ONE AGE LIKE ALL OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SLOW GROWTH AND ACCRETION OF AGES IT MUST HAVE RISEN STEP BY STEP FROM PICTURE WRITING THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE CONDITION LIKE THAT OF THE CHINESE
THIS WHOLE REGION WHEN THE SPANIARDS ARRIVED WAS A POPULOUS AND PROSPEROUS EMPIRE COMPLETE IN ITS CIVIL ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED BY AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY AND PRESENTING A NOTABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT ARTS OF CIVILIZED LIFE
THE PERUVIANS MADE LARGE USE OF AQUEDUCTS WHICH THEY BUILT WITH NOTABLE SKILL USING HEWN STONES AND CEMENT AND MAKING THEM VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE EXTENDED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES ACROSS SIERRAS AND OVER RIVERS
AND SHOULD FIX THE TRUE LENGTH OF THE TROPICAL YEAR WITH A PRECISION UNKNOWN TO THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS OF ANTIQUITY COULD BE THE RESULT ONLY OF A LONG SERIES OF NICE AND PATIENT OBSERVATIONS EVINCING NO SLIGHT PROGRESS IN CIVILIZATION
WHICH POSSESSED A PHONETIC ALPHABET IN ANY RESPECT KINDRED TO THIS PHOENICIAN ALPHABET IT CANNOT BE THE CHINESE ALPHABET WHICH HAS MORE SIGNS THAN WORDS IT CANNOT BE THE CUNEIFORM ALPHABET OF ASSYRIA WITH ITS SEVEN HUNDRED ARROW SHAPED CHARACTERS
THE FIRST HERMES HERE REFERRED TO AFTERWARD CALLED MERCURY BY THE ROMANS WAS A SON OF ZEUS AND MAIA A DAUGHTER OF ATLAS THIS IS THE SAME MAIA WHOM THE ABBE BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG IDENTIFIES
FORMING CONTINUOUS LINES AS IN THE STREETS OF MODERN CITIES STILL ALL THESE EDIFICES AND HALLS WERE AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE VAST SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH STRENGTHENED THEIR FOUNDATIONS WE FIND THE STRONGEST RESEMBLANCES TO THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENT EUROPEAN RACES
THE BRETON OF PURE BLOOD HAS A LONG HEAD LIGHT YELLOW COMPLEXION OF BISTRE TINGE EYES BLACK OR BROWN STATURE SHORT AND THE BLACK HAIR OF THE CABYLE LIKE HIM HE INSTINCTIVELY HATES STRANGERS IN BOTH ARE THE SAME PERVERSENESS AND OBSTINACY
SUBSIDES INTO THE MOUTH PIECE WHEN IT CONTRACTS GRADUALLY TO ONE TENTH OF AN INCH THE INNER SURFACE OF THE TUBE IS PERFECTLY SMOOTH TILL WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE POINT OF CONTRACTION
THERE WERE FOUND DEEP EXCAVATIONS WITH RUDE LADDERS HUGE MASSES OF ROCK BROKEN OFF ALSO NUMEROUS STONE TOOLS AND ALL THE EVIDENCES OF EXTENSIVE AND LONG CONTINUED LABOR IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE GREAT ONTONAGON MASS OF PURE COPPER WHICH IS NOW IN WASHINGTON WAS EXCAVATED BY THESE ANCIENT MINERS
AT HOPETOWN OHIO ARE TWO WALLED FIGURES ONE A SQUARE THE OTHER A CIRCLE EACH CONTAINING PRECISELY TWENTY ACRES
IN TIME THE GREEKS CARRIED THE WORK OF SIMPLIFICATION STILL FARTHER AND ELIMINATED THE TOP LINES
THEIR WORKS IN COTTON AND WOOL EXCEEDED IN FINENESS ANYTHING KNOWN IN EUROPE AT THAT TIME THEY HAD CARRIED IRRIGATION AGRICULTURE AND THE CUTTING OF GEMS TO A POINT EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OLD WORLD
THEY MADE KNOWN THE WORSHIP OF THIS GOD TO OTHER NATIONS TO THE EGYPTIANS FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS THE ATLANTEANS WERE THE FIRST KNOWN NAVIGATORS LIKE ALL NAVIGATORS THEY MUST HAVE PLANTED COLONIES AT A DISTANCE
THE LIBYAN AMAZONS OF DIODORUS THAT IS TO SAY THE LIBYANS OF THE IBERIAN RACE MUST BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE LIBYANS WITH BROWN AND GRIZZLY SKIN OF WHOM BRUGSCH HAS ALREADY POINTED OUT THE REPRESENTATIONS FIGURED ON THE EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS OF THE FOURTH DYNASTY
IT IS KNOWN THAT THE MEXICANS POSSESSED THE ART OF MANUFACTURING TRUE BRONZE AND THE INTERCOURSE WHICH EVIDENTLY EXISTED BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS PROVED BY THE PRESENCE OF IMPLEMENTS OF OBSIDIAN IN THE MOUNDS OF OHIO RENDERS IT PROBABLE THAT THE SAME COMMERCE WHICH BROUGHT THEM OBSIDIAN BROUGHT THEM ALSO SMALL QUANTITIES OF TIN
SIX THEY DIVIDED THE YEAR INTO TWELVE MONTHS
WHEN WE TURN TO MEXICO THE SAME RESEMBLANCES PRESENT THEMSELVES THE GOVERNMENT WAS AN ELECTIVE MONARCHY LIKE THAT OF POLAND THE KING BEING SELECTED FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY BY THE VOTES OF THE NOBLES OF THE KINGDOM THERE WAS A ROYAL FAMILY AN ARISTOCRACY
COMMERCE IMPLIES THE PLANTATION OF COLONIES THE TRADING POST IS ALWAYS THE NUCLEUS OF A SETTLEMENT
AND MEANS PRIMITIVE CHIEF AND MANCO
THIS IN TIME BECAME THE OLD HEBREW OR
SO LORD STRANGFORD WAS WRONG WHEN HE SUPPOSED THAT THE LAST VERB IN MI LIVED WITH THE LAST PATRIOT IN LITHUANIA PERU HAS STORES OF A GRAMMATICAL FORM WHICH HAS HAPPILY PERISHED IN EUROPE
HE WAS THEN ALLOWED TO USE THE GIRDLE OR SASH AROUND THE LOINS CORRESPONDING TO THE TOGA VIRILIS OF THE ROMANS HE WAS THEN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
MOST ANCIENT REMAINS OF MAN FOUND IN EUROPE ARE DISTINGUISHED BY A FLATTENING OF THE TIBIA AND THIS PECULIARITY IS FOUND TO BE PRESENT IN AN EXAGGERATED FORM IN SOME OF THE AMERICAN MOUNDS
THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME AT PARIS COULD BE SET INSIDE ONE OF THE HALLS OF KARNAC AND NOT TOUCH THE WALLS THE WHOLE VALLEY AND DELTA OF THE NILE FROM THE CATACOMBS TO THE SEA WAS COVERED WITH TEMPLES PALACES TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND PILLARS
NOW WHAT IS THE PECULIARITY OF THIS HIEROGLYPH THE CIRCLE BELOW IS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THERE ARE MANY CIRCULAR FIGURES IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CLEARLY IF ONE WAS CALLED UPON TO SIMPLIFY THIS HE WOULD RETAIN THE TWO SMALL CIRCLES JOINED SIDE BY SIDE
ALONG THESE GREAT ROADS CARAVANSARIES WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF TRAVELLERS THESE ROADS WERE ANCIENT IN THE TIME OF THE INCAS THEY WERE THE WORK OF THE WHITE AUBURN HAIRED BEARDED MEN FROM ATLANTIS THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS
THE IBERIANS ARE REPRESENTED TO DAY BY THE BASQUES THE BASQUE ARE OF MIDDLE SIZE COMPACTLY BUILT ROBUST AND AGILE OF A DARKER COMPLEXION THAN THE SPANIARDS WITH GRAY EYES AND BLACK HAIR THEY ARE SIMPLE BUT PROUD
THAT UNDER AN IMMENSE OCEAN IN THE FAR WEST THERE WAS AN UNDER WORLD A WORLD COMPRISING MILLIONS OF THE DEAD A MIGHTY RACE THAT HAD BEEN SUDDENLY SWALLOWED UP IN THE GREATEST CATASTROPHE KNOWN TO MAN SINCE HE HAD INHABITED THE GLOBE
THEY CALLED THE REGION THEY LEFT IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
AND TO SPECT THAT NOTHING GROWED BUT THAT AS SOON AS MEN WERE PLANTED ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE THEY WERE ALREADY THE CLEVEREST MEN THAT EVER LIVED ENDOWED WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE AND MORE POWER THAN THEIR SUCCESSORS FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES COULD ATTAIN TO
THE AGGLUTINATIVE IN WHICH ONE ROOT IS FASTENED ON TO ANOTHER AND A WORD IS FORMED IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS ARE OBVIOUSLY DISTINCT OR THE INFLEXIONAL WHERE THE AUXILIARY ROOTS GET WORN DOWN AND ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BY THE PHILOLOGIST
AMONG THEIR SCULPTURES IN OHIO WE FIND ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LAMANTINE MANATEE OR SEA COW FOUND TO DAY ON THE SHORES OF FLORIDA BRAZIL AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND OF THE TOUCAN A TROPICAL AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SOUTH AMERICAN BIRD
AS IN THE FOLLOWING WHICH WE COPY FROM THE TABLET OF THE CROSS AT PALENQUE WE TAKE
DOCTOR SCHLIEMANN IN HIS EXCAVATIONS OF THE RUINS OF TROY FOUND A NUMBER OF WHAT HE CALLS OWL HEADED IDOLS AND VASES
COVERING A SQUARE EACH SIDE OF WHICH IS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FEET
THEY RECORDED ALL THEIR LAWS THEIR TRIBUTE ROLLS SPECIFYING THE VARIOUS IMPOSTS THEIR MYTHOLOGY ASTRONOMICAL CALENDARS AND RITUALS THEIR POLITICAL ANNALS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY THEY WROTE ON COTTON CLOTH ON SKINS PREPARED LIKE PARCHMENT
THE BASQUE LANGUAGE THE EUSCARA HAS SOME COMMON TRAITS WITH THE MAGYAR OSMANLI AND OTHER DIALECTS OF THE ALTAI FAMILY AS FOR INSTANCE WITH THE FINNIC ON THE OLD CONTINENT
ISIRIS OSIRIS THE EGYPTIAN GOD
IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO QUOTE MISTER FERGUSON'S WORDS THAT THE COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS OF THE INCAS AND THE CYCLOPEAN REMAINS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PELASGIANS IN ITALY AND GREECE IS THE MOST REMARKABLE IN THE HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE
AND THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY WE CAN THEREFORE READILY BELIEVE THAT COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN ATLANTIS AND YUCATAN HONDURAS AND MEXICO CREATED COLONIES ALONG THE SHORES OF THE GULF WHICH GRADUALLY SPREAD INTO THE INTERIOR
BUT ON THE CONTRARY VERY PROBABLE FROM A CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE MOUND POTTERY THAT THE ANCIENT PEOPLE POSSESSED THE SIMPLE APPROXIMATION TOWARD THE POTTER'S WHEEL AND THE POLISH WHICH SOME OF THE FINER VESSELS POSSESS IS DUE TO OTHER CAUSES THAN VITRIFICATION
THE LATER GREEK BECAME OUR A
I LOVE MUNANI I SHALL LOVE MUNASA AND THAT THE AFFIXES DENOTING CASES IN THE NOUN ARE CURIOUSLY LIKE THE GREEK PREPOSITIONS
THE MASONRY IS SIMILAR THE CEMENT IS THE SAME THE SCULPTURES ARE ALIKE BOTH PEOPLES USED THE ARCH IN BOTH CONTINENTS WE FIND BRICKS GLASSWARE AND EVEN PORCELAIN
WITH THE LETTER M THAT IS DRAW FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HIEROGLYPH SOME SYMBOL THAT WILL BRIEFLY INDICATE THE WHOLE LETTER WE WILL HAVE ONE OF TWO FORMS
WHEN THEIR CHILDREN WERE NAMED THEY SPRINKLED THEIR LIPS AND BOSOMS WITH WATER AND THE LORD WAS IMPLORED TO PERMIT THE HOLY DROPS TO WASH AWAY THE SIN THAT WAS GIVEN IT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THE PRIESTS WERE NUMEROUS AND POWERFUL
THE RESULTS WE HAVE PRESUPPOSED ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHICH WE FIND TO HAVE EXISTED AT ONE TIME IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THE MOUND BUILDERS OF THE UNITED STATES WERE PRE EMINENTLY A RIVER PEOPLE
THE NATIVE TRADITIONS SAID THIS CITY WAS BUILT BY BEARDED WHITE MEN WHO CAME THERE LONG BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS AND ESTABLISHED A SETTLEMENT
AT THE TOP AND WOULD INDICATE THE LOWER CIRCLE WITH A LINE OR DASH AND WHEN WE TURN TO THE EGYPTIAN Q WE FIND IT IN THIS SHAPE
THEY CONSIST OF FIGURES OF BIRDS ANIMALS REPTILES AND THE FACES OF MEN CARVED FROM VARIOUS KINDS OF STONES UPON THE BOWLS OF PIPES UPON TOYS UPON RINGS AND IN DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FIGURES WE GIVE THE OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE EXAMINED THEM MISTER SQUIER OBSERVES
SIDE OF THE CIRCLE INSTEAD OF BELOW IT AS IN THE MAYA ARE THESE ANOTHER SET OF COINCIDENCES TAKE ANOTHER LETTER
BUT THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL HE FORTUNATELY HOWEVER PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY THE ALPHABET OF THIS PEOPLE WE PRESENT IT HEREWITH LANDA'S ALPHABET
ONE A CONNECTING LINK WITH THE ARYAN ROOTS AND TWO HAS ULTIMATELY ARRIVED FACE TO FACE WITH THE SURPRISING REVELATION THAT THE SEMITIC ROOTS ARE UNIVERSALLY ARYAN
OR A CIRCLE WITHIN A CIRCLE NOW WHERE DID THE PHOENICIANS GET IT CLEARLY FROM THE MAYAS
TO BE A SIMPLIFICATION OF CA BUT TURNED DOWNWARD IF NOW WE TURN TO THE EGYPTIAN LETTERS WE FIND THE SIGN
THAT THE ART OF WRITING ON PAPYRUS WAS UNDERSTOOD AS EARLY AS THE DAYS OF MENES HIMSELF THE FRUITS OF INVESTIGATION IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER SUBJECTS ARE TRULY MOST MARVELLOUS
AND THE ILLYRIAN S
AS EARLY AS FOUR THOUSAND OR FIVE THOUSAND B C THE FOURTH DYNASTY OF THE EGYPTIANS ACCORDING TO BRUGSCH DATES FROM ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED B C AT THIS TIME THE IBERIANS HAD BECOME SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO ATTEMPT THE CONQUEST OF THE KNOWN WORLD
THE CONSTANT CRY OF THE MOURNERS AS THE FUNERAL PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD WAS TO THE WEST TO THE WEST THIS UNDER WORLD WAS BEYOND THE WATER HENCE THE FUNERAL PROCESSION ALWAYS CROSSED A BODY OF WATER WHERE THE TOMBS WERE AS IN MOST CASES
THAT IN FACT THEY EXHIBIT THE MOST ASTOUNDING AFFINITIES WITH THE SEMITIC TONGUE AND PARTICULARLY THE ARABIC IN WHICH TONGUE DOCTOR FALB HAS BEEN SKILLED FROM HIS BOYHOOD FOLLOWING UP THE LINES OF THIS DISCOVERY DOCTOR FALB HAS FOUND
IN MANY PLACES THESE ROADS WERE CUT FOR LEAGUES THROUGH THE ROCK GREAT RAVINES WERE FILLED UP WITH SOLID MASONRY RIVERS WERE CROSSED BY SUSPENSION BRIDGES USED HERE AGES BEFORE THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO EUROPE
HE IS SIFTING OUT THE HEARTS OF MEN BEFORE HIS JUDGMENT SEAT MONOGAMY WAS THE STRICT RULE NOT EVEN THE KINGS IN THE EARLY DAYS WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE WIFE THE WIFE'S RIGHTS OF SEPARATE PROPERTY AND HER DOWER WERE PROTECTED BY LAW
THE MOST WESTERN CAPE PROJECTING INTO THE ATLANTIC IT WAS ONLY TO BE REACHED FROM EGYPT BY CROSSING THE WATER AND IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARK THE EMBLEM OF ATLANTIS IN ALL LANDS THE SOUL OF THE DEAD MAN WAS SUPPOSED TO JOURNEY TO THE UNDER WORLD BY A WATER PROGRESS
FORMED OF HORIZONTAL COURSES OF STONE EACH A LITTLE OVERLAPPING THE OTHER
AS WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED ANY TRACE OF THE RUDE SAVAGE EGYPT BUT HAVE SEEN HER IN HER VERY EARLIEST MANIFESTATIONS ALREADY SKILFUL ERUDITE AND STRONG IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ORDER OF HER INVENTIONS
EXTENDING FROM ONE DEGREE NORTH OF QUITO TO CUZCO AND FROM CUZCO TO CHILI IT WAS QUITE AS LONG AS THE TWO PACIFIC RAILROADS AND ITS WILD ROUTE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WAS FAR MORE DIFFICULT SARMIENTO DESCRIBING IT SAID
THE SERPENT AND THE PROTUBERANCE
OWL HEADED VASES TROY AND PERU
DIEGO DE LANDA WAS THE FIRST BISHOP OF YUCATAN HE WROTE A HISTORY OF THE MAYAS AND THEIR COUNTRY WHICH WAS PRESERVED IN MANUSCRIPT AT MADRID IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF HISTORY
WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR CIVILIZATION CAME TO THEM ACROSS THE SEA IN SHIPS FROM THE EAST THAT IS FROM THE DIRECTION OF ATLANTIS THE MAYAS SUCCEEDED TO THE COLHUAS WHOSE ERA TERMINATED ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF CHRIST
WHOM THE EGYPTIANS CALL THOUTH
AND PASSED THEIR TIME IN INDOLENT TRANQUILLITY
INDICATED BY THE SAME SOUND A SIGN FOR J WAS AFTERWARD ADDED WE HAVE ALSO IN COMMON WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LANGUAGES ADDED A DOUBLE U THAT IS V V OR W
WHERE EACH WORD OR THING WAS REPRESENTED BY A SEPARATE SIGN THE FACT THAT SO OLD AND ENLIGHTENED A PEOPLE AS THE CHINESE HAVE NEVER REACHED A PHONETIC ALPHABET
WERE THE SAME AS AMONG THE ANCIENT RACES OF THE OLD WORLD THEY BURNT THE BODIES OF THEIR GREAT MEN AND ENCLOSED THE DUST IN FUNERAL URNS SOME OF THEIR DEAD WERE BURIED IN A SITTING POSITION OTHERS RECLINED AT FULL LENGTH AND MANY WERE EMBALMED LIKE THE EGYPTIAN MUMMIES
SAME LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE SAME INFLEXION OF THE VOICE SAME EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS LISTEN TO A CABYLE SPEAKING HIS NATIVE TONGUE AND YOU WILL THINK YOU BEAR A BRETON TALKING CELTIC THE BRETONS HE TELLS US FORM A STRONG CONTRAST TO THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM
LOOK AT THE RECORD OF EGYPTIAN GREATNESS AS PRESERVED IN HER WORKS THE PYRAMIDS STILL IN THEIR RUINS ARE THE MARVEL OF MANKIND THE RIVER NILE WAS DIVERTED FROM ITS COURSE BY MONSTROUS EMBANKMENTS TO MAKE A PLACE FOR THE CITY OF MEMPHIS THE ARTIFICIAL LAKE OF MOERIS
WHO BY MEANS OF IT HAS DECIPHERED SOME OF THE OLD AMERICAN WRITINGS HE SAYS THE ALPHABET AND SIGNS EXPLAINED BY LANDA HAVE BEEN TO ME A ROSETTA STONE
AT THE FOOT OF SEA CLIFFS WHERE THE WAVES ARE POUNDING HARDEST ONE COMMONLY FINDS THE ROCK BENCH STREWN ON ITS INNER MARGIN WITH LARGE STONES DISLODGED BY THE WAVES AND BY THE WEATHER
THESE PROCESSES ARE KNOWN AS METAMORPHISM AND THE ROCKS AFFECTED WHETHER ORIGINALLY SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS ARE CALLED METAMORPHIC ROCKS WE MAY CONTRAST WITH METAMORPHISM THE ACTION OF EXTERNAL AGENCIES IN WEATHERING
IN OUR STUDY OF UNDERGROUND WATER WE LEARNED THAT IT IS EVERYWHERE CIRCULATING THROUGH THE PERMEABLE ROCKS OF THE CRUST DESCENDING TO PROFOUND DEPTHS UNDER THE ACTION OF GRAVITY AND AGAIN DRIVEN TO THE SURFACE BY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE
AND THE VIGOROUS AND UNIMPEDED ATTACK BY THE SEA UPON THE MAINLAND INDICATE THE STAGE OF MATURITY
AND ESPECIALLY BY THE DRAG OF SEDIMENTS TO THE REEF BY THE WAVES AS THEY DEEPEN THE SEA FLOOR ON ITS SEAWARD SIDE MEANWHILE THE LAGOON GRADUALLY FILLS WITH WASTE FROM THE REEF AND FROM THE LAND
THE ROCK BENCH HAS BEEN CUT BACK SO THAT IT NOW FURNISHES A GOOD ROADWAY FOR SHORE DRIFT THE STREAM OF ALONGSHORE DRIFT GROWS LARGER AND LARGER FILLING THE HEADS OF THE SMALLER BAYS WITH BEACHES BUILDING SPITS AND HOOKS
ON THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY STRONG TIDES ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN INLETS AT INTERVALS OF FROM TWO TO TWENTY MILES IN SPITE OF A HEAVY ALONGSHORE DRIFT SAND REEFS ARE FORMED WHERE THE WATER IS SO SHALLOW NEAR SHORE
THE MINERALS OF VEINS ARE THEREFORE CONSTANTLY BEING DISSOLVED ALONG THEIR UPPER PORTIONS AND CARRIED DOWN THE FISSURES BY GROUND WATER TO LOWER LEVELS WHERE THEY ARE REDEPOSITED
AND IS BORDERED ON THE ONE SIDE BY SHALLOW WATER GRADUALLY DEEPENING SEAWARD AND ON THE OTHER BY LOW LAND COMPOSED OF MATERIAL WHICH HAS NOT YET THOROUGHLY CONSOLIDATED TO FIRM ROCK
CALIFORNIA WAS THEN UNDER WATER AND THE SITE OF THE SIERRA WAS A SUBSIDING TROUGH SLOWLY FILLING WITH WASTE FROM THE GREAT BASIN LAND TO THE EAST OVER A LONG BELT WHICH REACHES FROM WYOMING ACROSS COLORADO INTO NEW MEXICO
WHICH RENDER ROCKS LESS COHERENT BY DISSOLVING THEIR SOLUBLE PARTS AND BREAKING DOWN THEIR CRYSTALLINE GRAINS CONTACT METAMORPHISM
WHERE THE CHANGES ARE MOST PROFOUND ROCKS MAY BE WHOLLY MADE OVER IN STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION IN CONTACT METAMORPHISM THIN SHEETS OF MOLTEN ROCK PRODUCE LESS EFFECT THAN THICKER ONES THE STRONGEST HEAT EFFECTS ARE NATURALLY CAUSED BY BOSSES
THE SANDY SOUTH SHORE OF MARTHA'S VINEYARD WEARS BACK THREE FEET A YEAR BUT HARD ROCKS RETREAT SO SLOWLY THAT THEIR RECESSION HAS SELDOM BEEN MEASURED BY THE RECORDS OF HISTORY
WHERE A COASTAL REGION IS UNDERGOING SUBMERGENCE THE SHORE LINE MOVES LANDWARD THE HORIZONTAL PLANE OF THE SEA NOW INTERSECTS AN OLD LAND SURFACE ROUGHENED BY SUBAERIAL DENUDATION
NO DOUBT IT IS NOW IN PROGRESS WHERE DEEP BURIED SEDIMENTS ARE INVADED BY HEAT EITHER FROM INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS MASSES OR FROM THE EARTH'S INTERIOR
THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE CREEPING DOWN SLOPES IS WASHED TO THE SEA BY STREAMS TOGETHER WITH THE MATERIAL WHICH THE STREAMS HAVE WORN FROM THEIR BEDS AND THAT DISSOLVED BY UNDERGROUND WATERS
COAL SWAMPS STRETCHED FROM WESTERN MONTANA INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA THE MIDDLE CRETACEOUS THIS WAS A LAND EPOCH THE EARLY CRETACEOUS SEA RETIRED FROM TEXAS AND MEXICO
WHAT EFFECT HAVE THESE SHEETS ON THE PRESENT TOPOGRAPHY AND WHY ASSUMING THAT THE TRIASSIC DEFORMATION WENT ON MORE RAPIDLY THAN DENUDATION WHAT WAS ITS EFFECT ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TIME ARE THERE ANY OF ITS RESULTS REMAINING IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF TO DAY
EVIDENTLY SUBSIDENCE WAS IN PROGRESS WHERE THESE ROCKS WERE DEPOSITED THE EASTERN BORDER OF APPALACHIA WAS NOW DEPRESSED THE OLDLAND WAS WARPING AND LONG BELTS OF COUNTRY LYING PARALLEL TO THE SHORE SUBSIDED FORMING TROUGHS IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF FEET OF SEDIMENT NOW GATHERED
IS DARK WITH GRAINS OF A NUMBER OF MINERALS SOFTER THAN QUARTZ THE WHITE SAND OF OTHER BEACHES AS THOSE OF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA IS ALMOST WHOLLY COMPOSED OF QUARTZ GRAINS
NOW FISSURES WHEREVER THEY OCCUR FORM THE TRUNK CHANNELS OF THE UNDERGROUND CIRCULATION WATER DESCENDS FROM THE SURFACE ALONG THESE RIFTS IT MOVES LATERALLY FROM EITHER SIDE TO THE FISSURE PLANE
BELOW WAVE BASE BASAL CONGOLMERATES AS THE SEA MARCHES ACROSS THE LAND DURING A SLOW SUBMERGENCE THE PLATFORM IS COVERED WITH SHEETS OF SEA LAID SEDIMENTS
THE SIERRA DEFORMATION EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE SILURIAN THE SIERRA TROUGH HAD BEEN SINKING THOUGH NO DOUBT WITH HALTS AND INTERRUPTIONS UNTIL IT CONTAINED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEET OF SEDIMENT
AND BECOMES A MEADOW SOLDERING THE SAND REEF TO THE MAINLAND WHILE THE LAGOON HAS BEEN FILLING THE WAVES HAVE BEEN SO DEEPENING THE SEA FLOOR OFF THE SAND REEF
BUT THE CHANGE IS OFTEN SO COMPLETE THAT NO TRACE OF THEIR ORIGINAL STRUCTURE AND MINERAL COMPOSITION REMAINS TO TELL WHETHER THE ROCKS FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED WERE SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS OR TO WHAT VARIETY OF EITHER OF THESE CLASSES THEY BELONGED
FROM THE LAND LYING TO THE EAST CONTEMPORANEOUS LAVA FLOWS INTERBEDDED WITH THE STRATA SHOW THAT VOLCANIC ACTION ACCOMPANIED THE DOWNWARP AND THAT MOLTEN ROCK WAS DRIVEN UPWARD THROUGH FISSURES IN THE CRUST AND OUTSPREAD OVER THE SEA FLOOR IN SHEETS OF LAVA
MICA SCHIST THE MOST COMMON OF SCHISTS AND IN FACT OF ALL METAMORPHIC ROCKS IS COMPOSED OF MICA AND QUARTZ IN ALTERNATING WAVY FOLIA ALL GRADATIONS BETWEEN IT AND PHYLLITE MAY BE TRACED
WITH THE CLOSE OF THE PERMIAN THE WORLD OF ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE HAD SO CHANGED THAT THE LINE IS DRAWN HERE WHICH MARKS THE END OF THE OLD ORDER AND THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AND SEPARATES THE PALEOZOIC FROM THE SUCCEEDING ERA THE MESOZOIC THE MIDDLE AGE OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY
THUS NEXT TO A DIKE BITUMINOUS COAL MAY BE BAKED TO COKE OR ANTHRACITE AND CHALK AND LIMESTONE TO CRYSTALLINE MARBLE SANDSTONE MAY BE CONVERTED INTO QUARTZITE AND SHALE INTO ARGILLITE A COMPACT MASSIVE CLAY ROCK
THERE NOW BEGAN ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EVENTS IN ALL GEOLOGICAL HISTORY THE GREAT CRETACEOUS SUBSIDENCE ITS EARLIER WARPINGS WERE RECORDED IN CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS WIDE SHEETS OF SANDSTONE SHALE AND SOME COAL WHICH WERE SPREAD FROM TEXAS TO BRITISH COLUMBIA
UNTIL THE TALUS FALLEN FROM THE CLIFF IS GRADUALLY BUILT UP BENEATH THE SEA TO THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE WAVES DRAG BOTTOM UPON IT AND BREAK
NEW MINERALS MAY ALSO BE DEVELOPED IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THERE MAY BE PRODUCED CRYSTALS OF MICA AND OF GARNET A MINERAL AS HARD AS QUARTZ COMMONLY OCCURRING IN RED TWELVE SIDED CRYSTALS
THE SURFACE ON WHICH THEY LIE IS WORN SO EVEN THAT WE MUST BELIEVE THAT AT THE OPENING OF THE CRETACEOUS THE OLDLAND OF APPALACHIA INCLUDING THE TRIASSIC AREAS HAD BEEN BASELEVELED AT LEAST NEAR THE COAST
COMPARED WITH SUBAERIAL DENUDATION MARINE ABRASION IS A COMPARATIVELY FEEBLE AGENT AT THE RATE OF FIVE FEET PER CENTURY A HIGHER RATE THAN OBTAINS ON THE YOUTHFUL ROCKY COAST OF BRITAIN
OR WHERE MINOR WATER COURSES CONIC DOWN TO THE SEA AND AID IN EROSION THE SHORE IS WORN BACK IN CURVED REENTRANTS CALLED COVES WHILE THE MORE RESISTANT ROCKS ON EITHER HAND ARE LEFT PROJECTING AS HEADLANDS
VIGOROUSLY THEY NOW WEAR IT BACK AND DRIVING THE SHORE LINE ACROSS THE LAGOON OR MEADOW CUT A LINE OF LOW CLIFFS ON THE MAINLAND SUCH A SHORE IS THAT OF GASCONY IN SOUTHWESTERN FRANCE
AND ITS RETREAT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY RAPID FOR THIS REASON ALONE SEA CLIFFS SELDOM OVERHANG BUT COMMONLY AS IN FIGURE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR SLOPE SEAWARD
AS IT WAS RELEASED FROM PRESSURE WHEN A PARTIAL VACUUM WAS FORMED BY THE REFLUENCE OF THE WAVE WHERE A CREVICE IS FILLED WITH WATER THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE BLOW OF THE WAVE IS TRANSMITTED BY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO THE SIDES OF THE FISSURE
MUCH WASTE IS BROUGHT IN BY RIVERS THE MATURITY OF SUCH A COAST MAY BE LONG DELAYED THE WASTE FROM THE LAND KEEPS THE SEA SHALLOW OFFSHORE AND CONSTANTLY RENEWS THE SAND REEF THE ENERGY OF THE WAVES IS CONSUMED IN HANDLING SHORE DRIFT
DRAWS ITS EVEN CURVE FOR A HUNDRED MILES TO CORPUS CHRISTI PASS AND THE REEFS ARE BUT SELDOM INTERRUPTED BY INLETS AS FAR NORTH AS GALVESTON HARBOR ON THIS COAST THE TIDES ARE VARIABLE AND EXCEPTIONALLY WEAK
ON THE COAST OF SCOTLAND THE FORCE OF THE BLOWS STRUCK BY THE WAVES OF THE HEAVIEST STORMS HAS SOMETIMES EXCEEDED THREE TONS TO THE SQUARE FOOT BUT EVEN A CALM SEA CONSTANTLY CHAFES THE SHORE
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE METHOD OF VEIN DEPOSITS WE MAY CITE THE CASE OF A WOODEN BOX PIPE USED IN THE COMSTOCK MINES NEVADA TO CARRY THE HOT WATER OF THE MINE FROM ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER
ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CLIFFS OF SOLID ROCK STORM WAVES ARM THEMSELVES WITH THE SAND AND GRAVEL THE COBBLES AND EVEN THE LARGE BOWLDERS WHICH LIE AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFF AND BEAT AGAINST IT WITH THESE HAMMERS
LOWEST OF THESE IS A CONGLOMERATE THE BOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACH WIDENED INDEFINITELY BY THE RETREAT OF THE CLIFFS AT WHOSE BASE IT WAS FORMED AND PRESERVED BY THE FINER DEPOSITS LAID UPON IT
WHOSE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE LAND DRAW A DIAGRAM OF A SEA CLIFF WHERE THE JOINTS DIP TOWARD THE SEA SEA CAVES THE WAVE DOES NOT MERELY BATTER THE FACE OF THE CLIFF
MOREOVER IT IS UNPROTECTED BY ANY SHIELD OF TALUS FRAGMENTS OF ROCK AS THEY FALL FROM ITS FACE ARE BATTERED TO PIECES BY THE WAVES AND SWEPT OUT TO SEA THE CLIFF IS THUS LEFT EXPOSED TO THE ATTACK OF THE WEATHER
EITHER BECAUSE OF A LOCAL UPLIFT OF THE LAND OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON SUCH AS THE LOWERING OF ANY PORTION OF OCEAN BOTTOM LAYS BARE THE INNER MARGIN OF THE SEA FLOOR
THUS IN SOLUBLE ROCKS SUCH AS LIMESTONES JOINTS ENLARGED BY PERCOLATING WATER ARE SOMETIMES FILLED WITH METALLIFEROUS DEPOSITS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
ON MANY COASTS THE LAND FRONTS THE OCEAN IN A LINE OF CLIFFS TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFFS THERE LEAD DOWN VALLEYS AND RIDGES CARVED BY RUNNING WATER WHICH IF EXTENDED
THE SEA CLIFF WEATHERS MORE RAPIDLY AS A RULE THAN DO ROCK LEDGES INLAND IT IS ABUNDANTLY WET WITH SPRAY ALONG ITS BASE THE GROUND WATER OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND FINDS ITS NATURAL OUTLET IN SPRINGS WHICH UNDER MINE IT
LIKE A SKILLFUL QUARRYMAN IT INSERTS WEDGES IN ALL NATURAL FISSURES SUCH AS JOINTS AND USES EXPLOSIVE FORCES AS A WAVE FLAPS AGAINST A CREVICE IT COMPRESSES THE AIR WITHIN WITH THE SUDDEN STROKE
IN ITS WARM AND QUIET WATERS LIMESTONES ACCUMULATED TO A DEPTH OF FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET IN TEXAS AND OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND FEET IN MEXICO MEANWHILE THE LOWLANDS WHERE THE GREAT PLAINS ARE NOW RECEIVED CONTINENTAL DEPOSITS
AND EVEN THE SEA HAS TAKEN INTO SOLUTION AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF GOLD AND OTHER METALS BUT IN THIS WIDELY DIFFUSED CONDITION THEY ARE WHOLLY USELESS TO MAN THE CONCENTRATION WHICH HAS MADE THEM AVAILABLE IS DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF MANY AGENCIES
THE PROCESS HOWEVER IS A SLOW ONE AND IF WE STUDY THESE SAND GRAINS UNDER A LENS WE MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THOUGH THEIR CORNERS AND EDGES HAVE BEEN BLUNTED THEY ARE YET FAR FROM THE SPHERICAL FORM OF THE PEBBLES FROM WHICH THEY WERE DERIVED
AS AN AGENT OF DESTRUCTION AND WE MUST FIRST TAKE UP ITS WORK IN EROSION BEFORE WE CONSIDER HOW IT TRANSPORTS AND DEPOSITS THE WASTE OF THE LAND SEA EROSION THE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH
THESE FEW EXAMPLES MUST SUFFICE OF THE GREAT CLASS OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS AS WE HAVE SEEN
AND THE WASTE WITH WHICH THEIR FLOORS WERE STREWN IS NOW IN PART LAID BARE AS CLAY PLAINS ABOUT THE BAY HEADS AND IN NARROW SELVAGES ABOUT THE PENINSULAS AND ISLANDS THE COAST OF DALMATIA
AND UNDER A VIGOROUS ATTACK OF THE SEA THE SHORE OF OPEN BAYS MAY BE CUT BACK ALSO SEA STACKS AND ROCKY ISLETS CAVES AND COVES MAKE THE SHORE MINUTELY RAGGED THE IRREGULARITY OF THE COAST DUE TO DEPRESSION
OR LEAVE IT FOR STREAMS TO TRANSPORT TO THE SAME GOAL ALL DEPOSITS MADE ON THE LAND SUCH AS THE FLOOD PLAINS OF RIVERS THE SILTS OF LAKE BEDS DUNE SANDS AND SHEETS OF GLACIAL DRIFT
PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS AND MORE BACK FROM THE CLIFF'S EDGE IN QUIET WEATHER THE BLOWHOLE IS A DEEP WELL IN STORM IT PLAYS A FOUNTAIN AS THE WAVES DRIVE THROUGH THE LONG TUNNEL BELOW AND SPOUT THEIR SPRAY HIGH IN AIR IN SUCCESSIVE JETS
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST EFFECT OF WAVE WEAR WAS TO INCREASE THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE SHORE IT SOONER OR LATER RECTIFIES IT MAKING IT SIMPLE AND SMOOTH NORTHWESTERN FRANCE MAY BE CITED AS AN UPLAND PLAIN DISSECTED AND DEPRESSED
THE SOLVENT POWER OF THE WATER IS THUS GREATLY INCREASED AND IT TAKES UP INTO SOLUTION VARIOUS SUBSTANCES FROM THE IGNEOUS AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS WHICH IT TRAVERSES
IT IS WIDESPREAD IN NEW ENGLAND AND ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS TALC SCHIST CONSISTS OF QUARTZ AND TALC A LIGHT COLORED MAGNESIAN MINERAL OF GREASY FEEL AND SO SOFT THAT IT CAN BE SCRATCHED WITH THE THUMB NAIL
ALTHOUGH THE MESOZOIC ERA IS SHORTER THAN THE PALEOZOIC AS MEASURED BY THE THICKNESS OF THEIR STRATA YET ITS DURATION MUST BE RECKONED IN MILLIONS OF YEARS
IS FOR A WHILE INCREASED BY DIFFERENTIAL WAVE WEAR ON HARDER AND SOFTER ROCKS THE ROCK BENCH IS STILL NARROW SHORE WASTE THOUGH BEING PRODUCED IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS FOR THE MOST PART SWEPT INTO DEEPER WATER AND BURIED OUT OF SIGHT
WITH SOME ROCK SALT AND GYPSUM FOSSILS ARE VERY RARE AND NONE OF THEM MARINE HERE THEN LAY BROAD SHALLOW LAKES OFTEN SALT AND WARPED BASINS IN WHICH THE WASTE OF THE ADJACENT UPLANDS GATHERED
CHAPTER SEVEN THE SEA AND ITS SHORES
EXAMPLES OF THIS STAGE ARE THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND AND THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR SAN FRANCISCO LATER YOUTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF SHORE WASTE
WHERE STORM WAVES FIRST DRAG BOTTOM THEY ERODE AND DEEPEN THE SEA FLOOR AND SWEEP IN SEDIMENT AS FAR AS THE LINE WHERE THEY BREAK HERE WHERE THEY LOSE THEIR FORCE THEY DROP THEIR LOAD AND BEAT UP THE RIDGE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE SAND REEF WHEN IT REACHES THE SURFACE
PROVIDED THAT THE ROCK ABOVE IS COHERENT ENOUGH TO FORM A ROOF OTHERWISE AN OPEN CHASM RESULTS BLOWHOLES AND SEA ARCHES
AND TYING ISLANDS WITH SAND BARS TO THE MAINLAND IT BRIDGES THE LARGER BAYS WITH BAY BARS WHILE THEIR LENGTH IS BEING REDUCED AS THEIR INCLOSING PROMONTORIES ARE CUT BACK BY THE WAVES
IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA THE LOWEST CRETACEOUS SERIES COMPRISES FRESH WATER FORMATIONS WHICH ARE TRACED FROM NANTUCKET ACROSS MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND LONG ISLAND AND THROUGH NEW JERSEY SOUTHWARD INTO GEORGIA THEY REST UNCONFORMABLY ON THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND THE OLDER ROCKS OF THE REGION
PERHAPS NOW AND THEN THE BASINS BECAME LONG BRACKISH ESTUARIES WHOSE LOW SHORES WERE SWEPT BY THE INCOMING TIDE AND WERE IN TURN LEFT BARE AT ITS RETREAT TO RECEIVE THE RAIN PRINTS OF PASSING SHOWERS AND THE TRACKS OF THE TROOPS OF REPTILES WHICH INHABITED THESE VALLEYS
HUDSON BAY AND THE NORTH THE BALTIC AND THE YELLOW SEAS ARE EXAMPLES WHERE THE SINKING OF THE LAND HAS BROUGHT THE SEA IN OVER LOW PLAINS OF LARGE EXTENT THUS DEEPLY INDENTING THE CONTINENTAL OUT LINE
EARTH MOVEMENTS FRACTURING DEEPLY THE ROCKS OF THE CRUST THE INTRUSION OF HEATED MASSES THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS HAVE ALL COOPERATED IN THE CONCENTRATION OF THE METALS OF MINERAL VEINS
IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN TEN MILLION YEARS TO PARE A STRIP ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE FROM THE MARGIN OF A CONTINENT A TIME SUFFICIENT AT THE RATE AT WHICH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NOW BEING WORN AWAY
AND BY WHICH THE WATER OF STREAMS FINDS WAY TO THE SEA NO FINER EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF SHORE LINE IS TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD THAN THE COAST OF TEXAS FROM NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIO GRANDE A
THE BAYS INTO WHICH THEY EMPTY BY THESE STEPS A COAST GRADUALLY ADVANCES TO MATURITY THE STAGE WHEN THE IRREGULARITIES DUE TO DEPRESSION HAVE BEEN EFFACED WHEN OUTLYING ISLANDS FORMED BY SUBSIDENCE HAVE BEEN PLANED AWAY
GIVE A ROUGH MEASURE OF THE DISTANCE IN SPACE AND TIME WHICH THEY HAVE TRAVELED FROM THEIR SOURCE THE SAND OF MANY BEACHES DERIVED FROM THE ROCKS OF ADJACENT CLIFFS OR BROUGHT IN BY TORRENTIAL STREAMS FROM NEIGHBORING HIGHLANDS
AND BENDS ROUND THE DIVIDES LEAVING THEM TO PROJECT AS PROMONTORIES AND PENINSULAS THE OUTLINES OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION ARE AS VARIED AS ARE THE FORMS OF THE LAND PARTIALLY SUBMERGED WE GIVE A FEW TYPICAL ILLUSTRATIONS
WHICH RECORD A LONG AND COMPLICATED HISTORY MARKED BY GREAT OSCILLATIONS OF THE CRUST AND WIDE CHANGES IN THE OUTLINES OF SEA AND LAND EARLY CRETACEOUS
ALSO ARE ABLE TO KEEP OPEN CHANNELS SCOURED BY THEIR EBB AND FLOW IN SUCH CASES THE MOST THAT LAND WASTE CAN DO IS TO BUILD SPITS AND SHOALS NARROWING AND SHOALING THE CHANNEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
THE SAME PLAIN EXTENDED OVER SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND
DO THE TRIASSIC AREAS NOW STAND HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND WHY HOW DO THE TRIASSIC SANDSTONES AND SHALES COMPARE IN HARDNESS WITH THE IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS ABOUT THEM
SUBAQUEOUS PLAIN GENTLY SHELVING FROM THE LAND SINCE THE NEW SHORE LINE IS DRAWN ACROSS THIS EVEN SURFACE IT IS SIMPLE AND REGULAR
SHOWING THEIR DERIVATION FROM A CONGLOMERATE DIKES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS MAY BE FOLLOWED INTO A REGION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOLIATED BY PRESSURE THE MOST THOROUGHLY METAMORPHOSED ROCKS MAY SOMETIMES BE TRACED OUT INTO UNALTERED SEDIMENTARY OR IGNEOUS ROCKS
THE CHEERFUL CLICK OF THE KNITTING NEEDLES MADE A PLEASANT HOME SOUND AND IN THE OCCASIONAL SNATCHES OF SLUMBER THAT OVERCAME HER MOTHER SYLVIA COULD HEAR THE LONG RUSHING BOOM OF THE WAVES DOWN BELOW THE ROCKS FOR THE HAYTERSBANK GULLEY ALLOWED THE SULLEN ROAR TO COME UP SO FAR INLAND
HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
A MINUTE AGO PHILIP AND HE WERE ON A LEVEL OF IGNORANCE FROM WHICH THE FORMER WAS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE RAISED BUT HE SOON RETURNED TO HIS USUAL STATE OF ACQUIESCENCE IN THINGS AS THEY WERE WHICH WAS PARTLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF HIS QUAKER TRAINING
SEVENTY MILES LONG AS WE COULD SWEAR TO INSIDE THAT GRAY COLD ICE CAME LEAPING FLAMES ALL RED AND YELLOW WI HEAT O SOME UNEARTHLY KIND
TILL BELL FAIRLY SHUT THE OUTER DOOR TO AND LOCKED IT BEFORE THE SPECKSIONEER HAD WELL GOT OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THEIR ROOF
IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
BUT NOT FOR LONG FOR BELL SUDDENLY STARTING UP DID ALL BUT TURN HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE IT WAS LATE SHE SAID
WE'N BEST KEEP THIS MATTER TO OURSELVES TILL THOU COMES INT PORT AGAIN
HE'S A NOTION OF BEING SWEET ON YO HISSELF NOT HE SAID SYLVIA WITH SOME CONTEMPT IN HER TONE
GEARIN AND A AN FOLK IS TALKIN ON A NEW KIND O MAK AND IF THOU'S BOUND FOR YORK I'M NOT GOING BY YORK I'M GOING BY A NEWCASTLE SMACK NEWCASSEL
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THOUGH FROM THE MONOTONOUS COURSE OF THE EVENING IT SEEMED MUCH LATER
AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
JUST AS A WERE GIVING UP BOTH WORDS AND LIFE THEY HEAVED ME ABOARD
AND HERE THEY WERE READY FOR BREAD AND CHEESE AND AUGHT ELSE THE MISTRESS WOULD SET BEFORE THEM
BUT IT MUST BE SO COLD SAID SYLVIA
BLACK AND BITTER BUT WELCOME ENOUGH TO THE FARMERS
STORES HAD TO BE PURCHASED BY THE WHALING MASTERS WARM CLOTHING OF ALL SORTS TO BE PROVIDED THESE WERE THE LARGER WHOLESALE ORDERS BUT MANY A MAN AND WOMAN TOO BROUGHT OUT THEIR SMALL HOARDS TO PURCHASE EXTRA COMFORTS OR PRECIOUS KEEPSAKES FOR SOME BELOVED ONE
SYLVIA APPEARING TO LISTEN TO MOLLY'S CONFIDENCES WAS HEARKENING IN REALITY TO ALL THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN HER FATHER AND THE SPECKSIONEER AND AT THIS INVITATION SHE BECAME ESPECIALLY ATTENTIVE KINRAID REPLIED I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO YE I'M SURE
BY THE TIME SHE COULD SIT DOWN AGAIN HER FATHER AND KINRAID HAD THEIR GLASSES FILLED AND WERE TALKING OF THE RELATIVE MERITS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF SPIRITS THAT LED ON TO TALES OF SMUGGLING AND THE DIFFERENT CONTRIVANCES BY WHICH THEY OR THEIR FRIENDS HAD ELUDED THE PREVENTIVE SERVICE
HALF A GLANCE INTO THE GRAY DARKNESS OUTSIDE MADE HER SUDDENLY TIMID AND SHE DREW BACK BEHIND THE DOOR AS SHE OPENED IT WIDE TO ADMIT HER FATHER AND KINRAID DANIEL ROBSON CAME IN BRIGHT AND BOISTEROUS HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIS PURCHASE AND HAD HAD SOME DRINK TO CELEBRATE HIS BARGAIN
JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
WELL LUCKILY FOR US WE HAD OUR SECOND BOAT
WHEN AS IN THE PAST SHE TOOK HER KNITTING OUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE FRESHNESS OF THE FAINT SEA BREEZE AND DROPPING DOWN FROM LEDGE TO LEDGE OF THE ROCKS THAT FACED THE BLUE OCEAN ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN A PERILOUS NOOK THAT HAD BEEN HER HAUNT EVER SINCE HER PARENTS HAD COME TO HAYTERSBANK FARM
AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
A WERE A PRECIOUS SIGHT TO LOOK ON FOR MY CLOTHES WAS JUST HARD FROZEN TO ME AN MY HAIR A'MOST AS BIG A LUMP O ICE AS YON ICEBERG HE WAS A TELLING US ON THEY RUBBED ME AS MISSUS THEERE WERE RUBBING T HAMS YESTERDAY AND GAV ME BRANDY AN A'VE NIVER GETTEN T FROST OUT O MY BONES FOR A THEIR RUBBIN
THE NEXT ROSE UP EQUALLY NATURALLY IN THE MIND OF MISSUS CORNEY AND WHAT WILL YE TAK
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO BELIEVE NO ONE SAW THE REAL MOTIVE OF ALL THIS ALMOST INHOSPITABLE HASTE TO DISMISS HER GUEST HOW THE SUDDEN FEAR HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER THAT HE AND SYLVIA WERE FANCYING EACH OTHER
THE TONES THE LOOKS THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THOSE WORDS BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS I DIDN'T THINK TO SEE YO
AT ANY RATE IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME HE LIKED KINRAID AND HAD STRONG SYMPATHY NOT MERELY WITH WHAT HE KNEW OF THE YOUNG SAILOR'S CHARACTER BUT WITH THE LIFE HE LED AND THE BUSINESS HE FOLLOWED
SYLVIA HAD DROPPED HER WORK AND SAT GAZING AT KINRAID WITH FASCINATED WONDER
AND SAIL FOR THE NORTH SEAS DAY AFTER HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH FOR ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIS INTERROGATOR PHILIP INDEED HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HIM HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BID GOOD BY TO SYLVIE IS SHE AT HOME HE ASKED OF HER FATHER
AS DISTURBING HER IN THE ONE BLESSED SUBJECT OF THOUGHT IN WHICH ALONE SHE CARED TO INDULGE WELL PHILIP AN WHAT BRINGS HERE WAS HER RATHER UNGRACIOUS GREETING WHY SYLVIE ARE YO SORRY TO SEE ME
HIS COMPLEXION HAD BEEN WEATHERBEATEN AND BRONZED THOUGH NOW HE LOOKED SO PALE HIS EYES AND HAIR WERE DARK
WHEN YO'VE T HOLD HARD WI T OTHER HAND ON T BACK OF A WHALE SWIMMIN FOURTEEN KNOTS AN HOUR
PHILIP KNOWS SAID HESTER AND THEN SOMEHOW HER VOICE FAILED HER AND SHE STOPPED PHILIP PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS HALF UTTERED SENTENCE HE WAS EAGER TO TELL COULSON AS FAR AS HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS MASTER'S SECRET HOW MANY DRAWBACKS THERE WERE TO HIS PROPOSED JOURNEY
DARK THE WOOD FIRE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER BY CAREFUL HANDS DIED OUT INTO GRAY ASHES DOLLY REID HAD DONE HER WORK AND GONE HOME THERE WERE BUT PHILIP AND SYLVIA IN THE HOUSE
THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO RISE WHAT DOES T GREAT UGLY BRUTE DO
HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE
PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
SHE STOOPED FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED AND CAME UP RED AS A ROSE TO BE SURE WHAT THEN AND SHE EYED HIM DEFIANTLY THOUGH IN HER HEART SHE TREMBLED SHE KNEW NOT WHY WHAT THEN
NAY SAID PHILIP I KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT IT'S NONE O MY DOING GOING FOR I'D LIEFER HA STAYED WHERE I AM YO'LL LIKE IT WHEN ONCE YO'RE THERE
THIS FAULT OF HIS WAS ONE WITH WHICH THE TWO GRAVE SEDATE YOUNG MEN HAD NO SYMPATHY THEIR HEARTS WERE TRUE AND CONSTANT WHATEVER ELSE MIGHT BE THEIR FAILINGS AND IT IS NO NEW THING TO DAMN THE FAULTS WE HAVE NO MIND TO
AN A THOWT A WERE SAFE FOR ANOTHER DIVE INT SAUT WATER
ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
BEFORE GOING TO SEA SAID PHILIP HALF SMILING NA
HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
CAREFULLY PINNED ACROSS AT THE WAIST OF HER BROWN STUFF GOWN HOW WELL IT WAS THOUGHT THE YOUNG GIRL THAT SHE HAD DOFFED HER BED GOWN AND LINSEY WOOLSEY PETTICOAT HER WORKING DRESS AND MADE HERSELF SMART IN HER STUFF GOWN WHEN SHE SATE DOWN TO WORK WITH HER MOTHER
SHE FELT HIS EYES WERE UPON HER WATCHING EVERY MOTION AND GREW MORE AND MORE CONFUSED IN HER EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR HE WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE NATURE OF HIS RECEPTION AND WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE THE GREAT CHANGE IN HER MANNER
COME LASSIE THIS LAST TO HIS DOG SO SYLVIA SET OFF WITH A DANCING HEART AND A DANCING STEP
AND ONE WAS ON HER LEFT HAND WHICH SHE SUPPOSED HERSELF TO BE MENDING BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE MADE LONG PAUSES AND LOOKED IN THE FIRE AND YET THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOTION OF FLAME OR LIGHT IN IT OUT OF WHICH TO CONJURE VISIONS
I'LL RECKON TO HEAR FRO THEE IN A WEEK OR MAYHAP LESS
AND TO WARN YO IF NEED WERE MY MOTHER NIVER BADE YO TO COME SPYING AFTER ME AND BLAMING ME FOR SEEING A LAD AS MY FEYTHER THINKS WELL ON
SHALL I GO TAKE IT OFF AND PUT ON MY SHAWL ASKED SYLVIA A LITTLE DOLEFULLY NA NA COME ALONG
SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS CHOKING DOWN HER TEARS
PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
AND WHICH WAS AS DEAD AS NOAH'S GRANDFATHER
TO WHICH IN COMPARISON ALL LIFE SPENT ON SHORE WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING FOR DULNESS
SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
AS TO MAKE IT AN EXPENSIVE SOMETIMES AN UNATTAINABLE LUXURY TO THE WORKING MAN GOVERNMENT DID MORE TO DEMORALISE THE POPULAR SENSE OF RECTITUDE AND UPRIGHTNESS THAN HEAPS OF SERMONS COULD UNDO
IT WERE YO'R OWN MOTHER SYLVIA AS KNOWED YO HAD NO BROTHER OR ANY ONE TO SEE AFTER YO AND YO SO PRETTY SO PRETTY SYLVIA HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY THAT MEN RUN AFTER YO AGAINST THEIR WILL AS ONE MAY SAY
LIKE NANCY AND BORROWING THE POOR GIRL'S OWN WORDS SHE WOULD SAY SOFTLY TO HERSELF HE ONCE WAS HERE BUT ALL ALONG SHE BELIEVED IN HER HEART HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN TO HER THOUGH IT TOUCHED HER STRANGELY TO IMAGINE THE AGONIES OF FORSAKEN LOVE
I WERE THROWN UP IN T AIR LIKE A SHUTTLECOCK ME AN MY LINE AN MY HARPOON UP WE GOES AN MANY A GOOD PIECE O TIMBER WI US AN MANY A GOOD FELLOW TOO
HE CAUGHT THE LOOK ON SYLVIA'S FACE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY INTERPRETED ITS DUMB WISTFULNESS MISSUS SAID HE
NIVER FRET THYSELF MOTHER ABOUT T SHIRT SAID PHILIP IF I NEED A SHIRT
THE BUTCHER HAD BEEN GLAD TO TAKE THE BEST PARTS OF A PIG OF DAME ROBSON'S CAREFUL FEEDING BUT THERE WAS UNUSUAL PLENTY IN THE HAYTERSBANK PANTRY AND AS BELL SURVEYED IT ONE MORNING SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND
AN OUD MAN LIKE ME ISN'T AS GOOD COMPANY AS A PRETTY LASS LAUGHING A LOW RICH LAUGH OVER HIS OWN WIT DANIEL WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED SYLVIE
THOU'S HEERD ME TELL IT HASTN'T TA YES SAID BELL BUT IT'S A LONG TIME AGO WHEN WE WAS COURTING AN THAT'S AFORE THIS YOUNG LASS WERE BORN AS IS A'MOST UP TO WOMAN'S ESTATE BUT SIN THOSE DAYS A HA BEEN O'ER BUSY TO TELL STORIES TO MY WIFE
THAT WAS BEST IGNORED IN SUCH A DISORDERLY FAMILY BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A WARM WELCOME TO FRIENDS HOWEVER ROUGHLY GIVEN
GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
AND GOD BLESS YO I'M SORRY I VEXED YO NO REPLY WITH A HEAVY HEAVY HEART HE CREAKED DOWN THE STAIRS FELT FOR HIS CAP AND LEFT THE HOUSE
AND LAST OF ALL CAME THE PIG KILLING
IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
WE SAILED ON AND WE SAILED ON FOR MORE DAYS NOR I COULD COUNT
AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
IT'S A CHANCE MISSUS AS THOU HAD STOPPED AN OUD MAID EH DEAR A ME SAID BELL
AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
DANIEL HAD JUST HAD ENOUGH DRINK TO MAKE HIM VERY GOOD TEMPERED
THAT WERE COLD A CAN TELL THE FIRST I SMARTED ALL OWER ME AS IF MY SKIN WERE SUDDENLY STRIPT OFF ME AND NEXT
BUT THERE'S HEAT TOO SOME PLACES SAID KINRAID
BUT SYLVIA ENJOYED HER OWN THOUGHTS AND ANY CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISTURBANCE TO HER THE LONG MONOTONOUS ROLL OF THE DISTANT WAVES AS THE TIDE BORE THEM IN THE MULTITUDINOUS RUSH AT LAST AND THEN THE RETREATING RATTLE AND TRICKLE
HE WOUND UP WITH A CHUCKLE AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THIS GREAT PIECE OF BUSINESS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR ONLY CHILD HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS AWAY
SHE'S GETTEN A BASKET WI SAUSAGES IN EM AS MY MISSUS HAS MADE AND SHE'S A RARE HAND AT SAUSAGES
AS A FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM OR OTHERWISE BY AND BY LUCKILY FOR HIM IN SOME TURN OF HER ARM TO REACH THE SCISSORS ON THE TABLE SHE CAUGHT THE EDGE OF HER WORK BASKET AND DOWN IT FELL SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP THE SCATTERED STOCKINGS AND BALL OF WORSTED
PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
SHE HASTILY GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM
I SHALL GO TO SEA HAPPY NOW THINKING I'VE YO'R WORD YO'RE NOT ONE TO GO BACK FROM IT I'M SURE ELSE IT'S A LONG TIME TO LEAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AS YO AND NE'ER A CHANCE OF A LETTER REACHING YO JUST TO TELL YO ONCE AGAIN HOW I LOVE YO
IT WERE WILLIE COULSON AS TELLED ME AS SOLEMN AND SERIOUS AS ONE MAN CAN SPEAK TO ANOTHER
AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
AN AS A'LL WARRANT SHE'S FORGOTTEN IT AN AS SYLVIA HERE NIVER HEERD IT IF YO'LL FILL YOUR GLASS KINRAID YO SHALL HA T BENEFIT O'T A
AND HE BEGAN THE STORY SYLVIA KNEW SO WELL FOR HER FATHER NEVER MADE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE BUT WHAT HE TOLD HIM OF HIS SELF MUTILATION TO ESCAPE THE PRESS GANG IT HAD BEEN DONE AS HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE OWNED TO SPITE HIMSELF AS WELL AS THEM
AND THEN THEY SAT DOWN ON THE SETTLE TOGETHER AND WHEN SHE WAS MORE COMPOSED THEY BEGAN TO TALK HE ASKED HER ABOUT HER MOTHER NOT SORRY IN HIS HEART AT BELL ROBSON'S ABSENCE
SHE MAY AS WELL PUT ON HER CLOAK AND STEP DOWN WI ME AND SEE MOLLY A BIT
SO LONG AS SHE SPOKE GRACIOUSLY TO HIM HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER OR THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AND EITHER CAUSE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TREAT HER WITH A GRAVE REGARD AND DEFERENCE WHICH HAD A REPRESSED TENDERNESS IN IT
THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
THE NIGHT WAS VERY STILL THOUGH NOW AND THEN CRISP SOUNDS IN THE DISTANT AIR SOUNDED VERY NEAR IN THE SILENCE SYLVIA CARRIED THE BASKET AND LOOKED LIKE LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THE MORALITY OF THE AFFAIR ONE OF THE GREATEST SIGNS OF THE REAL PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE SINCE THOSE TIMES SEEMS TO BE THAT OUR DAILY CONCERNS OF BUYING AND SELLING EATING AND DRINKING WHATSOEVER WE DO ARE MORE TESTED BY THE REAL PRACTICAL STANDARD OF OUR RELIGION THAN THEY WERE IN THE DAYS OF OUR GRANDFATHERS
OF WHICH SHE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED WAS QUITE UNAWARE SHE LIKED HIM BETTER TOO THAN SHE HAD DONE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHOW HER ANY OF THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH TEASED HER THEN ALTHOUGH ITS MEANING WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
CONSCIOUS OF THE DEMAND IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT WAS WAR TIME TOO MANY CAPTAINS UNABLE TO PROCURE MEN IN MONKSHAVEN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR CREWS IN THE SHETLANDS THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WERE EQUALLY BUSY
SAYING IT WAS MORE THAN HE SHOULD REQUIRE BUT THEY REPEATED WITH FRESH URGENCY THEIR WARNINGS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE HIGH PRICES OF LONDON TILL HE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT AND BRING BACK ALL THAT HE DID NOT EXPEND SINCE NOTHING BUT HIS TAKING THE WHOLE SUM WOULD SATISFY HIS EMPLOYERS
AND YO'R PARENTS MAY LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER FOR YO MY PRETTY
I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
SYLVIA SAT IN THE HOUSE PLACE HER BACK TO THE LONG LOW WINDOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE LIGHT THE AFTERNOON HOUR AFFORDED FOR HER WORK A BASKET OF HER FATHER'S UNMENDED STOCKINGS WAS ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE HER
HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
HE JUST DWINED AWAY AND WE HADN'T TAKEN BUT ONE WHALE AFORE OUR CAPTAIN DIED
WHILE HE APPEARED TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WITH QUIET BUSINESS LIKE ATTENTION IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY NORTHWARDS TO HARTLEPOOL WHENCE HE COULD EASILY PROCEED EITHER BY LAND OR SEA TO NEWCASTLE FROM WHICH PLACE SMACKS WERE CONSTANTLY SAILING TO LONDON
AN WE WAS ANCHORED OFF T COAST O GREENLAND ONE SEASON AN WE'D GETTEN A CARGO O SEVEN WHALE
SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
NOTHING MORE AS PHILIP'S INSTINCT TOLD HIM BUT HE REASONED THAT FIRST CORRECT IMPRESSION AWAY WITH INGENIOUS SOPHISTRY NOT TO LIVE THERE ONLY TO STAY FOR SOME TIME
THERE'S T ICE THAT'S BAD THERE'S DIRTY WEATHER THAT'S WORSE
ONE BOAT LIES STILL HOLDING T END O T LINE
THERE'LL BE NO NEED O THAT MURMURED SYLVIA SHE WAS TOO DIZZY WITH HAPPINESS TO HAVE ATTENDED MUCH TO HIS DETAILS OF HIS WORLDLY PROSPECTS BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS TENDER WORDS OF LOVE HER EAGER HEART WAS READY TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
AND YET THESE MUST BE REACHED BEFORE JUNE OR THE YEAR'S EXPEDITION WOULD BE OF LITTLE AVAIL EVERY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP RUNG WITH THE RHYTHMICAL CLANG OF BUSY HAMMERS BEATING OUT OLD IRON SUCH AS HORSESHOES NAILS OR STUBS INTO THE GREAT HARPOONS
DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
AS I WERE SA FOND ON AND FED MYSEL AND AS WOULD HA BEEN FOURTEEN STONE BY NOW IF HE WERE AN OUNCE AND AS KNEW ME AS WELL AS ANY CHRISTIAN AND A PIG AS I MAY SAY THAT I JUST IDOLIZED WENT AND TOOK A FIT A WEEK AFTER MICHAELMAS DAY AND DIED AS IF IT HAD BEEN TO SPITE ME
HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
EVEN BY A SMILE BUT SHE WATCHED HIM AS IT SUNK INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH AN INTENTNESS
BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
THE FLASH WHICH HAD NOT YET SUBSIDED FROM THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE EBBED SLOWLY AWAY AS HE ENCOUNTERED HIS FATHER'S EYE I MEAN TO WORK HE MURMURED
INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
THE STEP ON THE WALK HAD MOUNTED TO THE FRONT DOOR NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INQUIRED THE FATHER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ANSWERED THE SON THE JUDGE
OR THAT I HAVE EVER LOVED YOU HER EYES
WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
WOULD THUS BE LOST YOU SEE I HAD NOT CALCULATED ON MISS AMABEL PAGE
NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
HE DROPPED THE PAPER WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH FREDERICK WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTICE FATHER HE BEGAN WITHOUT PREAMBLE OR EXCUSE
YOU THINK YOU OUGHT NOT TO MARRY ME AFTER WHAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT
TO IN SPEAKING OF LAST NIGHT
AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
AM I SO HARD TO TALK TO THAT THE WORDS WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR LIPS I HAVE PROMISED MY FATHER I WILL NEVER MARRY YOU HE FEELS THAT HE HAS GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU AND AS I OWE HIM EVERYTHING
I WILL SOON PROVE ITS VALUE IN YOUR EYES FOLLOW ME UP STAIRS TO MY FATHER HIS ENERGY THE ENERGY OF DESPAIR NO DOUBT SEEMED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER
AND HUSH HE COMMANDED IN UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION PRESSING HIS HAND WITH IMPULSIVE ENERGY AGAINST HER MOUTH NOT ANOTHER WORD OF THAT OR I SHALL FORGET YOU ARE A WOMAN
IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
AND IF YOU SWORE THAT YOU DID I SHOULD ONLY FIND IT HARDER TO REPEAT WHAT MUST AGAIN BE SAID
I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
CAN NEVER TAKE PLACE I HAVE GIVEN MY SOLEMN PROMISE TO WELL WELL
EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
AND THIS TIME AS IF YOU DID MEAN IT WHAT IS THE TRUTH TELL ME WITHOUT COQUETRY OR DISSEMBLING
WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DISTRUST ME BUT YOU ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK WATTLES WHAT I DID ONCE I CAN NEVER DO AGAIN AND I HOPE I MAY LIVE TO PROVE MYSELF A CHANGED MAN AS FOR THAT CHECK
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
THE LOVE THE PASSION
AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
BUT DO NOT STRUGGLE TOO RELENTLESSLY
I HAVE ANOTHER RELATIVE THERE LIVING AT THE HOUSE WHEN SHALL I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU IN MY NEW HOME NEVER IT WAS SAID REGRETFULLY AND YET WITH A CERTAIN BRUSQUENESS
THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
THE CLOCK OVER THE MANTEL HAD TOLD OFF FIVE OF THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU SAID HIS FATHER AND DREW OUT HIS CHECK BOOK BUT HE DID NOT HASTEN TO OPEN IT
AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
AH HE EJACULATED HIS FACE CONTRACTING WITH SUDDEN PAIN YOUR LOVE THEN IS BUT A POTENTIALITY
DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
I WILL BE BACK BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN STAIRS JUST AS THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND WATTLES STEPPED IN AH
AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
TO NIGHT CONSCIOUS THOUGH I AM THAT YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DENY ME THIS REQUEST AND THAT MY DEBT TO YOU ALREADY PASSES THE BOUND OF PRESUMPTION ON MY PART AND INDULGENCE ON YOURS
AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
HIS EYES STILL RESTED ON HIS SON NOW MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN THERE IS A TRAIN LEAVING SOON I WISH TO GET IT AWAY ON THAT TRAIN HIS FATHER FROWNED WITH NATURAL DISTRUST
THAT UNKNOWN TO ME UNKNOWN TO ANYONE LIVING BUT HERSELF UNKNOWN TO THAT GOOD MAN FROM WHOM IT CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT HIDDEN AGATHA WEBB WAS MY MOTHER
AND IN THE TRIUMPH OF HER HEART ALLOWED A LOW LAUGH
JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
BEYOND THIS AND THE INFERENCES IT AFTERWARD AWAKENED IN HER MIND SHE WOULD NOT GO
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU GROANED THE YOUNG MAN STARTING AS HE HEARD A STEP ON THE WALK WITHOUT YOUR NEED HAS BECOME STRANGELY IMPERATIVE PROCEEDED THE OTHER
OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
THE WORD SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF A BLOW INNOCENT HE REPEATED INNOCENT BECOMING PALER STILL AS THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER MEANING BROKE GRADUALLY UPON HIM
WITH SUCH FEELINGS
I ENCOUNTERED A MAN SITTING ASLEEP BY THE TABLE IT WAS JOHN THE ELDER OF THE TWO AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR FOOD AND IN A CONDITION OF EXTREME MISERY I TOOK OUT THE FIRST BILL MY HAND ENCOUNTERED
WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
AND THE INVOLUNTARY OPENING AND SHUTTING OF HIS HANDS REVEALED THE EMOTION UNDER WHICH HE WAS LABOURING
A GASP OF IRRESISTIBLE FEELING ESCAPED HIM
HENCEFORTH OUR LIVES ARE ONE MY GOD IT WAS ALL HE SAID BUT IT SEEMED TO CREATE A GULF BETWEEN THEM IN THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED
NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
YOU WILL COME TO SPRINGFIELD SOON SHE AVOWED SLIPPING FROM BEFORE HIM SO AS TO LEAVE THE WAY TO THE DOOR OPEN AMABEL
FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
WELL I'M NOT WORTH IT FREDERICK MORE AND MORE ASTOUNDED UNDERSTANDING HER LESS THAN EVER BUT CHARMED BY LOOKS THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED AN ANCHORITE HE TURNED
STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
THERE IS NO BLOOD ON YOU SHE MURMURED YOU DID NOT STRIKE THE BLOW
THAT YOU WILL NOT BE THE LOSER BY THIS MATERIAL PROOF OF CONFIDENCE IN ME AS I SHALL SOON BE IN A POSITION TO REPAY ALL MY DEBTS AMONG WHICH
AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
THEN SO VERY MUCH HE WAS ANGRY POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE FELT HIS RESOLUTION FAILING HIM YOU KNOW HE HOTLY BEGAN STEPPING BACK THEN
I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
AND I BEGIN TO THINK IT DOES BUT LISTEN SUTHERLAND SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
SHE ROSE WITH A BOUND NOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ANTICIPATED HAD OCCURRED FACTS OF WHICH SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS AND MADE THE POSITION OF FREDERICK SOMETHING SO REMOTE FROM ANY SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PROCLAIM YOURSELF A FORGER OUTRIGHT AS TO FORCE YOUR FATHER TO DECLARE THIS TO BE HIS SIGNATURE HE OBSERVED I KNOW IT SAID FREDERICK
MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
AT DINNER A NIGHT OR TWO AGO I HAPPENED TO SAY THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN IN DANGER OF DROWNING I AM NOT SURE NOW THAT IT WAS TRUE BUT I STILL THINK THAT IT WAS HARMLESS HOWEVER BEFORE I HAD TIME TO ELABORATE MY THEME WHATEVER IT WAS I WAS PEREMPTORILY ORDERED TO TOUCH WOOD
IT IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE POND A DESIGNATION WHICH IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL NEIGHBOURING PONDS THE GIFTS OF NATURE AND GIVES THE WHOLE CREDIT TO THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
BENEATH THE MASK OF OUTWARD AFFECTION THERE MAY LURK UNKNOWN TO US THE SERPENT'S TOOTH OF JEALOUSY MARY WRITES THAT SHE CAN MAKE NOTHING FOR MY STALL AT THE BAZAAR AS SHE HAS HER OWN STALL TO PROVIDE FOR ATE MY BREAKFAST MECHANICALLY MY THOUGHTS BEING FAR AWAY
BOGEY BEING FIVE BUT IF THE BAD CRICKETER SAYS I REMEMBER WHEN I TOOK A CENTURY IN FORTY MINUTES OFF LOCKWOOD AND RICHARDSON HE IS NOTHING BUT A LIAR FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS GOLF IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD FOR THE BAD PLAYER
IS THE BETTER SELF WITHIN ME NEVER TO RISE TO THE SUBLIME HEIGHTS OF SELFLESSNESS OF WHICH IT IS CAPABLE ROSE AT FOUR AND WROTE TO MARY FORGIVING HER THIS HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE SPIRIT YES
WHO REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND THAT THE OTHERS ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OF IT IT IS OBVIOUS YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING OF YOU
BUT CAN THERE BE AN IDEAL BARRISTER OTHER THAN A SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER THE EAGER YOUNG WRITER JUST BEGINNING A LITERARY CAREER MIGHT
I LEFT A MALACCA CANE THERE ONCE RATHER A GOOD ONE TOO
WILL BE THE BETTER SERVED BY REASON OF IT LET US TAKE A CASE SMITH VERSUS JONES COUNSEL IS BRIEFED FOR SMITH AFTER EXAMINING THE CASE HE TELLS HIMSELF IN EFFECT THIS
SUCH AS HAVE GUIDED MEN ALONG THE PATH OF TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FROM WHAT HO SHE BUMPS TO ICH DIEN AND MORE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
IF YOU OR I HAD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN OUR HANDS WE SHOULD NO DOUBT ARRANGE SOME REMARKABLY BRIGHT AND TELLING EFFECTS A MAN WHO SPILT THE SALT CALLOUSLY WOULD BE DROWNED NEXT WEEK IN THE DEAD SEA AND A COUPLE WHO MARRIED IN MAY WOULD EXPIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE MAY FOLLOWING
OR SOME SUDDENLY DISCOVERED INNOVATION THE ONLY THING WHICH CAN VARY IN HIS GAME IS HIS PUTTING AND PUTTING IS NOT GOLF BUT CROQUET BUT OF COURSE WE TOO ARE GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS VARDON ONE DAY
OR WAS THAT HIS UNCLE ANYWAY SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HIM WHAT A VERY TALENTED FAMILY IT WAS IN THE SAME WAY SIDNEY MANDRAGON HAS HAD
UPON SUCH A LITTLE DEPENDS OR SEEMS TO THE EIGHTEEN HANDICAP TO DEPEND EXCELLENCE IN GOLF AND SO PERFECTLY HAPPY IN OUR PRESENT BADNESS AND PERFECTLY CONFIDENT OF OUR FUTURE GOODNESS WE LONG HANDICAP MEN REMAIN
NEVER MIND WHETHER HE FAILS MORE OFTEN OR LESS OFTEN THAN OTHERS TO ATTAIN THEM I AM NOT BOTHERING ABOUT THAT I ONLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER
THE CHARM OF GOLF WHEN HE READS OF THE NOTABLE DOINGS OF FAMOUS GOLFERS THE EIGHTEEN HANDICAP MAN HAS NO ENVY IN HIS HEART FOR BY THIS TIME HE HAS DISCOVERED THE GREAT SECRET OF GOLF
WAS LATE AT THE OFFICE AS I HAD TO LOOK IN AT THE PALACE ON THE WAY IN ORDER TO GET KNIGHTED BUT MANAGED TO GET A GOOD DEAL OF WORK DONE BEFORE I WAS INTERRUPTED BY A MADMAN WITH A RAZOR
IT MUST BE UNADORNED SO THAT IT SHALL LACK OSTENTATION AND YET IT MUST HAVE A BAND SO THAT WHEN YOU THROW STONES AT IT YOU CAN COUNT TWO IF YOU HIT THE SILVER YOU BEGIN TO SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT STICK WELL
I DON'T KNOW WHY PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE WALKS ABOUT THE TEMPLE IN A TOP HAT SO MANY OF ONE'S ACQUAINTANCES AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HAVE EATEN DINNERS
WITH AMONG OTHERS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AS SOON AS WE LEFT LIVERPOOL STREET SHE PRODUCED A BAG OF SHRIMPS GRASPED EACH INDIVIDUAL IN TURN FIRMLY BY THE HEAD AND TAIL
AND REMAINS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE BAINES IS A LIFE MEMBER HE SAVED AN OLD LADY FROM BEING RUN OVER BY A MOTOR BUS SOME YEARS AGO AND WHEN SHE DIED SHE LEFT HIM A LEGACY
MONDAY ANOTHER EXCITING DAY SHOT A COUPLE OF HOOLIGANS ON MY WAY TO BUSINESS AND WAS FORCED TO GIVE MY CARD TO THE POLICE ON ARRIVING AT THE OFFICE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE BUILDING ON FIRE
BECOMES A BETTER FIGHTER AGAINST DISEASE ADVANCING HIMSELF NO DOUBT BUT ADVANCING ALSO MEDICAL SCIENCE JUST AS THE SCHOOLMASTER HAVING LEARNT NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF TEACHING
I PERCEIVE NOW THAT I WAS OVER HASTY IN DECIDING TO BECOME A GROCER THAT IS RATHER FOR ONE'S OLD AGE WHILE ONE IS YOUNG AND INTERESTED IN PERSONS RATHER THAN IN THINGS
HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
THAT AN INTERESTING ARTICLE MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM IT SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY ENOUGH I LEFT IT IN THE TRAIN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO MASTER IT I SHALL BE AT THE BOOKSTALL NEXT MONDAY
SEDLEY OF COURSE WILL BE ELECTED AS AN ORDINARY MEMBER BUT AS THERE IS A STRONG FEELING ON THE COMMITTEE THAT NO DECENT MAN COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE OF THEIR COMPANY BUT I AM PREPARED TO MAKE A SUGGESTION TO THE FOUNDER OF THE SCHOOL IT IS THAT HE SHOULD INVENT A PIPE WHITE SPOT AND ALL WHICH SMOKES ITSELF
SO IT WILL BE A HAPPY MEETING UNDER THE PINK MAY TREE OF LABURNUM LODGE WHEN THESE TWO ARE RESTORED SAFELY TO EACH OTHER AFTER THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE DAY POSSIBLY
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SORT OF DIARY WHICH CAN NEVER BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE AT ALL I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR GIVING A THIRD SELECTION OF EXTRACTS MONDAY ROSE AT NINE AND CAME DOWN TO FIND A LETTER FROM MARY HOW LITTLE WE KNOW OUR TRUE FRIENDS
MAY FIND DELIGHT IN A LIBRARY OF WELL BOUND BOOKS THEY ARE PLEASANT TO HANDLE PLEASANT TO TALK ABOUT
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE D W T THE DECLINED WITH THANKS CLUB THERE ARE NO CLUB ROOMS AND NOT MANY MEMBERS BUT THE BALANCE SHEET FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IS WONDERFUL SHOWING THAT MORE THAN
IT IS THE PIPE RATHER THAN THE TOBACCO WHICH MARKS HIM AS BELONGING TO THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL HE PINS HIS FAITH NOT SO MUCH TO ITS LABOUR SAVING DEVICES
AND PLANNED THE POND ACCORDINGLY A MOST NECESSARY THING IN A COUNTRY HOUSE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECOGNIZED MEETING PLACE
ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS OF LIVING HAVE SOMETHING OF NOBILITY IN THEM WE ENTER THEM FULL OF HIGH RESOLVES
HOW OFTEN DOES YOUR PARTNER CRY
IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
AND UTTER CONTEMPT IN EVERY WORD IT WAS HENDERSON TOO WHO RESIGNED HIS POSITION AS DRAMATIC CRITIC BECAUSE THE PROPRIETOR OF HIS PAPER DID RATHER A SHADY THING IN PRIVATE LIFE
THE REPORTER MURMURS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR IN A PUZZLED SORT OF WAY GEORGE MEREDITH
OR TO MAKE MORE POPULAR THE NEGLECTED BEAUTIES OF BARNET IF HE COULD HOPE THAT AFTER HIS THREE HUNDREDTH JOURNEY INQUISITIVE PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO FOLLOW HIM WONDERING WHAT HE WAS AFTER
FOR IT WAS GIVEN TO ME THIS VERY MORNING AT MY FIRST SIGHT OF IT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT REPLACE THE COMMON ONE WHICH I LOST IN AN EASTER TRAIN THAT WAS SILLY OF ME I MUST HAVE A STICK OF LESS GENTLE BIRTH WHICH IS NOT AFRAID TO BE SEEN WITH A SOFT HAT
BUT WE SHOULD HARDLY BE PROUD OF OUR NEW PROFESSION WE SHOULD PREFER TO EARN A THOUSAND A YEAR BY DOING SOME MORE USEFUL WORK INDEED TO A MAN OF ANY FINE FEELING
IF THEY CANNOT SAY ATTACKED BY A LION IN BOND STREET TO DAY THEY CAN AT LEAST SAY
FIX HIS EYES UPON FRANCIS THOMPSON RATHER THAN UPON SIR HALL CAINE THE EAGER YOUNG CLERGYMAN MIGHT DREAM DREAMS OVER THE LIFE OF FATHER DAMIEN MORE OFTEN THAN OVER THE LIFE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
OR PULL UP THE LUNCHEON BASKET WHICH YOU WANT EVEN MORE BADLY
WE WANDER DOWN TO THE POND TOGETHER AND PERHAPS FIND BROWN AND MISS SMITH THERE A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT SAYS BROWN IT WAS ONLY JUST OVER THE THIRD STEP AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY
FOR WHEREAS MEN OF AN OLDER SCHOOL LIKE MYSELF SMOKE FOR THE PLEASURE OF SMOKING MEN OF THIS SCHOOL SMOKE FOR THE PLEASURE OF PIPE OWNING OF SELECTING WHICH OF THEIR MANY WHITE SPOTTED PIPES THEY WILL FILL
SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
EACH ONE OF US MUST LET GO THOSE PROPERTIES WHICH HIS OWN STICK CAN DO BEST WITHOUT FOR MYSELF I INSIST ON THIS MY STICK MUST BE GOOD FOR HITTING AND GOOD TO HIT WITH A STICK WE ARE AGREED IS SOMETHING TO HAVE IN THE HAND WHEN WALKING
THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
MOST PEOPLE WILL PREFER IN THE ABSENCE OF THE LION TO SAY NOTHING OR NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN ATTACKED BY THE HAIRDRESSER WITH A HARD BRUSH BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO MUST GET PEN TO PAPER SOMEHOW AND WHO FIND THAT ONLY IN REGARD TO THEIR EMOTIONS HAVE THEY ANYTHING UNIQUE TO SAY
WEDNESDAY PLAYED DOMINOES AT LUNCH AND WON FIVEPENCE IF THIS SORT OF DIARY IS NOW FALLING INTO DECAY
HAVING BOUGHT THEM ONE WAS FREE TO SMOKE CIGARETTES HOWEVER AT THE END OF MY FIRST YEAR I GOT TO WORK SERIOUSLY ON A SHILLING BRIAR AND I HAVE SMOKED THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT EVER SINCE
I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
YOU HAVE BOUGHT A NEW BAT PERFECT IN BALANCE
I TAPPED THE TABLE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND NOW I SUPPOSE I AM IMMUNE AT THE SAME TIME I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHOM I HAVE APPEASED FOR THIS MUST BE THE IDEA OF THE WOOD TOUCHING SUPERSTITION THAT A MALIGNANT SPIRIT DOGS ONE'S CONVERSATIONAL FOOTSTEPS
HAPPY THE MAN WHO CAN SAY OF EACH LITTLE INCIDENT I MUST REMEMBER TO TELL HER WHEN I GET HOME AND IT IS ONLY IN THE SUBURBS THAT ONE GETS HOME ONE DOES NOT
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND IF OUR JOURNEY SHALL HAVE TAKEN US TO THE BEACH OUR STICK MUST AT ONCE BE PROPPED IN THE SAND WHILE FROM A SUITABLE DISTANCE WE THROW STONES AT IT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL THE SEA ITS BEAUTY CAN ONLY BE APPRECIATED PROPERLY IN THIS FASHION
A DOCTOR COLLECTS FEES FROM HIS PATIENTS BUT HE IS AIMING AT SOMETHING MORE THAN POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE HE IS OUT TO PUT AN END TO SUFFERING A SCHOOLMASTER
TO BE DISINCLINED TO LEAVE IT TILL LUNCH TIME A MAN OR WOMAN AS LAZY AS THIS MUST NOT BE RUSHED SAY TO SUCH A ONE COME AND PLAY AND THE INVITATION
THAT THE MORE EXPERT HE BECOMES AS AN ADVOCATE THE BETTER WILL HE BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS JUSTICE WHICH IS HIS IDEAL CAN HE TELL HIMSELF THIS
OLD MOORE I AM SORRY TO SAY LEFT ME COLD I SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY BUT I CANNOT I SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE HEAVENLY BODIES SORT THEMSELVES INTO CERTAIN POSITIONS IN ORDER THAT ZADKIEL MAY BE KEPT IN TOUCH WITH THE FUTURE
AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
IS GIVING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD EXPRESSING THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT FOR HIS OWN PROFIT PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR THAT ALONE
COULD I STEP ON TO THE BOAT IN A SILK HAT AND THEN RETIRE BELOW BUT I AM ALWAYS UNWELL BELOW AND THAT WOULD NOT SUIT ITS DIGNITY IT STANDS NOW IN A CORNER OF MY ROOM CRYING ALOUD TO BE TAKEN TO THE OPERA I USED TO DISLIKE MEN WHO TOOK CANES TO COVENT GARDEN
APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING IT USUALLY I SPEAK ABOUT IT AT MY FIRST MEETING WITH A STRANGER IT IS MY OPENING REMARK JUST AS YOURS IS SOMETHING FUTILE ABOUT THE WEATHER
IN THE MORNING TOO ANNE WILL WALK WITH HIM TO THE END OF THE ROAD
ONE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A TITLED GENTLEMAN IN HARLEY STREET AN IDEAL SCHOOLMASTER IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH THE HEADMASTER OF ETON OR THE OWNER OF THE MOST PROFITABLE PREPARATORY SCHOOL
THAT IN HIS BUSINESS LIKE BRAIN HE HAS EACH ONE OF THEM NICELY LABELLED A GALLANT SOLDIER BEING GOOD FOR SO MUCH NEW BUSINESS A TITLED MAN OF LETTERS
BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
AND ARE ONLY CONCERNED TO DISPLAY THAT READINESS IN THE FACE OF ANY SOCIAL EMERGENCY WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE MARK OF GOOD MANNERS
BUT IF YOU OR I WERE TO SAY TO OUR SCRATCH FRIEND WHAT AM I DOING WRONG HE WOULD REPLY AT ONCE MOVING THE HEAD OR DROPPING THE RIGHT KNEE OR NOT GETTING THE WRISTS IN SOON ENOUGH AND BY TO MORROW WE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT PLAYERS
IF A MAN STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A POND SAID ALOUD I HAVE NEVER FALLEN INTO A POND IN MY LIFE AND WE HAPPENED TO BE JUST BEHIND HIM THE TEMPTATION TO PUSH HIM IN WOULD BE IRRESISTIBLE IRRESISTIBLE THAT IS BY US
THAN THE ANSWERS I HAVE GIVEN BUT IT IS NO ANSWER TO ASK ME HOW THE LAW CAN BE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT BARRISTERS I DO NOT KNOW NOR DO I KNOW HOW THE ROADS CAN BE SWEPT
HOW COULD YOU DO MOST GOOD WITH IT SOME SAY THEY WOULD ENDOW HOSPITALS SOME
THERE ARE FOR INSTANCE HALF A DOZEN JOURNALISTS AND AUTHORS NOW A JOURNALIST BEFORE HE CAN BE ELECTED MUST HAVE A BLACK LIST OF PAPERS FOR WHICH HE WILL REFUSE TO WRITE
FROM A PROFESSION IN THE FIRST PLACE CERTAINLY WE EXPECT A LIVING BUT I THINK WE WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES
THERE IS ONLY ONE PROFESSION TO FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF BOOKSTALL CLERK TO BE BEHIND A BOOKSTALL IS INDEED TO SEE LIFE THE FASCINATION OF IT STRUCK ME SUDDENLY
I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
BUT GO YOURSELF SHE WILL NOT HEAR ME DID YOU DID YOU PREVENT HER FROM LISTENING WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE BEEN HERE AGES I SENT A NOTE IN BY HER MAID AND SHE RETURNED NO ANSWER
THE QUICKER WE GO THE BETTER AND AS THE MEN SETTLED THEMSELVES AGAIN TO THEIR OARS ONE WAS PUT INTO PHILAMMON'S HAND WHICH HE MANAGED WITH SUCH STRENGTH AND SKILL THAT HIS LATE TORMENTORS WHO IN SPITE OF AN OCCASIONAL INCLINATION TO ROBBERY AND MURDER
HE ALONE WAS SILENT AMID THE YELLS OF TRIUMPH SORROWFULLY HE SWAM ROUND AND ROUND HIS LITTLE PAPER WRECK IT WOULD NOT HAVE FLOATED A MOUSE WISTFULLY
WHICH WAS NOW RECEDING RAPIDLY PAST THEM AND WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE REALLY FLOATING DOWNWARDS AGAIN WITHOUT AN EFFORT TO STEM THE STREAM HE PUT AWAY HIS BILL AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN DELIBERATELY IN HIS PLACE ASTONISHING THE ONLOOKERS QUITE AS MUCH AS PHILAMMON HAD DONE
AND GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF I DO NOT USE THAT POWER TO MORROW I SWEEP OUT THIS AUGEAN STABLE OF VILLAINY
BRING HER I MUST SEE HER SHE MUST BE NOBLE INDEED
VAULTED HALLS STAIRCASES DOORWAYS SOME FAST SOME OPEN UP AND DOWN TRYING THIS WAY AND THAT LOSING HIMSELF AT WHILES IN THAT ENORMOUS SILENT LABYRINTH AND HIS BREATH FAILED HIM HIS THROAT WAS PARCHED
RAPHAEL RECOLLECTED THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME A NOTE WHICH HE HAD SEEN BROUGHT TO HER DURING THE CONVERSATION I SAW HER RECEIVE A NOTE SHE TOSSED IT AWAY TELL ME YOUR STORY IF THERE IS REASON IN IT
WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO A SUDDEN STOP BY FINDING THE STEM OF THE BARGE CLOSE ON HIM A NOOSE THROWN OVER HIM BY SOME FRIENDLY BARBARIAN AND HIMSELF HAULED ON BOARD AMID THE LAUGHTER PRAISE ASTONISHMENT AND GRUMBLING OF THE GOOD NATURED CREW
HE AND HIS FRAIL BARK WERE OVERTURNED AND THE MONSTER WITH HIS HUGE WHITE TUSKS GAPING WIDE CLOSE ON HIM AS HE STRUGGLED IN THE STREAM LUCKILY PHILAMMON CONTRARY TO THE WONT OF MONKS WAS A BATHER AND SWAM LIKE A WATER FOWL
WHO WILL SING IT TO THE HEROES SING IT YOURSELF IF YOU CHOOSE PELAGIA SINGS QUITE WELL ENOUGH FOR ME IN AN INSTANT THE CUNNING BEAUTY CAUGHT AT THE HINT AND POURED FORTH A SOFT LOW SLEEPY SONG LOOSE THE SAIL REST THE OAR FLOAT AWAY DOWN
BRING THEM UP PETER TAKE THIS YOUTH INTRODUCE HIM TO THE PARABOLANI WHO WILL BE THE BEST MAN FOR HIM TO WORK UNDER THE BROTHER THEOPOMPUS IS ESPECIALLY SOBER AND GENTLE CYRIL SHOOK HIS HEAD LAUGHINGLY
AT ALL EVENTS THE DOORS LEADING FROM THE MUSEUM ITSELF MIGHT BE OPEN HE KNEW THEM EVERY ONE EVERY HALL PASSAGE STATUE PICTURE
BEFORE IT STRUCK SOME OF THE MORE SOBER MINDED THAT IT WAS AS WELL TO WAIT FOR SOME MORE DECIDED DEMONSTRATION OF ATTACK BEFORE INCURRING SO HEAVY A CARPENTER'S BILL OF REPAIRS AT LAST THE HEAVY TRAMP OF FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD COMING DOWN THE STREET
HE WOULD KEEP UP A DEN OF FIENDS IN ALEXANDRIA IF THEY WOULD DO AS MUCH FOR HIM AND THEN TO PLAY THEM OFF AGAINST ME AND MINE
AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE WAYS OF IT SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEE IT AND BE FILLED WITH THE FRUIT OF HIS OWN DEVICES AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY FILLED WITH THE SAME IN FIVE MINUTES MORE IN SOME SHAPE TOO UGLY TO BE MENTIONED BUT
THE RELATIONS AND DUTIES OF COMMON HUMANITY SHONE WITH NONE OF THE AWFUL AND DIVINE MEANING WHICH THEY DID IN THE EYES OF THE CONVERTED JEW AWAKENED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE TO KNOW THE MEANING OF HIS OWN SCRIPTURES AND BECOME AN ISRAELITE INDEED
LO AND BEHOLD AS SHE WAS OVERWHELMING HIM WITH THANKS A FRESH MOB POURED INTO THE STREET FROM THE UPPER END AND WERE CLOSE ON THEM BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE A FLUSH OF TERROR AND DESPAIR AND THEN A BURST OF JOY AS
THE NEGRESS WAS KNEELING UNDER THE GATEWAY POURING OUT HER SIMPLE THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DELIVERANCE
BUT HEAR ME ONCE MORE BELOVED HYPATIA YOU REFUSE TO GIVE UP THE BEAUTIFUL THE SUBLIME THE HEAVENLY
BROOCHES AND ROMAN COINS STRUNG LIKE NECKLACES ONLY THE STEERSMAN WHO HAD COME FORWARD TO WONDER AT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AND TO HELP IN DRAGGING THE UNWIELDY BRUTE ON BOARD SEEMED TO KEEP GENUINE AND UNORNAMENTED THE COSTUME OF HIS RACE THE WHITE LINEN LEGGINGS
AND WHEN HE WENT OUT INTO THE PASSAGE I HEARD HIM SAY TO ANOTHER
AND THEN BY WAY OF MENDING IT DECLARED THAT SHE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT HER MISTRESS COULD TURN ASIDE THE LIGHTNING AND CALL LEGIONS OF SPIRITS TO FIGHT FOR HER WITH A NOD WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH SUCH IDOLATERS AND YET WHO COULD HELP LIKING THEM THE BETTER FOR IT
BY MINGLED MOONLIGHT AND TORCHLIGHT PHILAMMON DESCRIED PRIESTLY ROBES AND IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE BATTLE THERE BEING NO APPARENT DANGER PETER THE READER WHO SEEMED TO BE ANXIOUS TO PREVENT INQUIRY BY BEGINNING TO TALK AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
AND MADE HIM ALL BUT WISH THE KINDLY EARTH WOULD OPEN AND HIDE HIM TOOK THE LETTERS READ THEM AND THEN BEGAN PHILAMMON
AND FELL FAST ASLEEP IN A MINUTE HE WAS JUST WELTERING ABOUT IN A DREARY DREAM JUMBLE OF GOTHS DANCING WITH DISTRICT VISITORS PELAGIA AS AN ANGEL WITH PEACOCK'S WINGS HYPATIA
OUTRAGE AND MURDER ONLY FORBIDDEN AS I HAVE SAID IT GOD DO SO TO ME AND MORE ALSO IF THERE BE A JEW LEFT IN ALEXANDRIA BY TO MORROW AT NOON GO AND THE STAFF OF ORDERLIES FILED OUT
IN THEMSELVES SEEM FITTED TO AROUSE NO FEELINGS EXCEPT INDIGNATION AND DISGUST WHAT IF
GO INTO THE NEXT ROOM MY SON NO PETER PUT HIM UNDER SOME FIERY SAINT SOME TRUE BOANERGES WHO WILL TALK HIM DOWN AND WORK HIM TO DEATH AND SHOW HIM THE BEST AND WORST OF EVERYTHING CLEITOPHON WILL BE THE MAN NOW THEN
THANK HEAVEN IT WAS THE SOLDIERY
THERE THEY STARVED AND ROTTED HEAP ON HEAP THE MASSES OF THE OLD GREEK POPULATION
I SHALL DO AS I THREATENED AND RUN AWAY WITH PRINCE WULF IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE WHOLE CREW ARE EXPECTING YOU TO MAKE THEM AN ORATION WHEREUPON THE AMAL ROSE SEE YOU HERE WULF THE SON OF OVIDA AND WARRIORS ALL
THAT MIGHT BE CARNAL TRUE BUT HE WISHED TO CONVERT THE WORLD WAS NOT THAT SPIRITUAL WAS HE NOT GOING ON A NOBLE ERRAND THIRSTING FOR TOIL FOR SAINTSHIP FOR MARTYRDOM ITSELF IF IT WOULD BUT COME AND CUT THE GORDIAN KNOT OF ALL TEMPTATIONS
THAT IS ONE THIRD OF IT CAME FROM THENCE AND ANOTHER THIRD CAME FROM THE SOUTHERN OCEAN OVER THE MOON MOUNTAINS WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN AND THE REMAINING THIRD FROM THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PHOENIX LIVED AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE THAT WAS AND THEN THERE WERE THE CATARACTS
OR ILL TAUGHT OR UNIMAGINATIVE OR DULL BUT SIMPLY BEING UNRIGHTEOUS WHAT IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IT ALONE WAS THE BEAUTIFUL RIGHTEOUSNESS THE SUBLIME THE HEAVENLY THE GODLIKE AY
ALL WAS ACTIVITY AND EXCITEMENT AND IT WAS NO WONDER IF PHILAMMON'S CURIOSITY HAD TEMPTED HIM TO DRIFT DOWN ALMOST ABREAST OF THE BARGE ERE HE DESCRIED PEEPING FROM UNDER A DECORATED AWNING IN THE AFTERPART SOME DOZEN PAIRS OF LANGUISHING BLACK EYES
A SUDDEN TURN OF THE BANK BROUGHT HIM IN SIGHT OF A GAUDILY PAINTED BARGE OIL BOARD OF WHICH ARMED MEN IN UNCOUTH AND FOREIGN DRESSES WERE CHASING WITH BARBARIC SHOUTS SOME LARGE OBJECT IN THE WATER IN THE BOWS STOOD A MAN OF GIGANTIC STATURE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PHILAMMON FELT A HOSTILE GRIPE UPON HIM AND A NEW SENSATION RUSHED THROUGH EVERY NERVE AS HE GRAPPLED WITH THE WARRIOR CLUTCHED WITH HIS LEFT HAND THE UP LIFTED WRIST AND WITH HIS RIGHT THE GIRDLE AND COMMENCED WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE AIM
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GARDENS LAY THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE THERE WERE GATES IN PLENTY COMMUNICATING BETWEEN THEM IF HE COULD BUT SEE ORESTES EVEN ALARM THE GUARD IN TIME AND HE HURRIED THROUGH THE WALKS AND ALCOVES
TO THE BLAZE OF MOON AND STARLIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE STREET AND WALLS AND SHINING ROOFS HUNG BACK A MOMENT THAT HESITATION PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE FOR IN AN INSTANT HE SAW A DARK FIGURE SPRING OUT OF THE SHADOW
LET ME SEE MY ENGAGEMENTS FIVE MINUTES FOR THESE JEWS ORESTES DID NOT CHOOSE TO FRIGHTEN THEM LET US SEE WHETHER CYRIL CANNOT THEN AN HOUR TO LOOK OVER THE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS AN HOUR FOR THE SCHOOLS
THE SONS OF THE AESIR WHAT WAS THE BOND BETWEEN YOUR FATHERS AND MINE WAS IT NOT THAT WE SHOULD MOVE AND MOVE SOUTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD EVER TILL WE CAME BACK TO ASGARD THE CITY WHERE ODIN DWELLS FOR EVER AND GAVE INTO HIS HANDS THE KINGDOM OF ALL THE EARTH
THE BEARS' FUR CLOAK THE ONLY ORNAMENTS OF WHICH WERE THE FANGS AND CLAWS OF THE BEAST ITSELF AND A FRINGE OF GRIZZLED TUFTS WHICH LOOKED BUT TOO LIKE HUMAN HAIR THE LANGUAGE WHICH THEY SPOKE WAS UTTERLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO PHILAMMON
AND THEN WENT FORWARD AS MANY OF THEM AS WERE NOT ROWING
COME THEN MY OLIVE TREE MY GAZELLE MY LOTUS FLOWER MY WHAT WAS THE LAST NONSENSE YOU TAUGHT ME
I SAY THE GOVERNOR LOOKED LIKE A LIAR AND I SAY THIS MONK LOOKS LIKE AN HONEST FELLOW AND I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE HIM AND THERE IS AN END OF IT DON'T LOOK SO CROSS AT ME PRINCE WULF I'M SURE IT'S NOT MY FAULT I COULD ONLY SAY WHAT THE MONK TOLD ME
HE KNEW NOT WHY HE SEIZED HIS PADDLE AND TRIED TO BACK OUT OF THE SNARE BUT SOMEHOW HIS VERY EFFORTS TO ESCAPE THOSE SPARKLING EYES DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION FROM EVERYTHING ELSE THE HIPPOPOTAMUS HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND FURIOUS WITH PAIN
AND THIS IS THE WAY THEY HAVE KEPT THEIR PROMISE SO BE
WHERE WERE THEY HE DID NOT KNOW NOBODY KNEW IT RAN FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS JOURNEY THROUGH DESERTS WHERE NOTHING BUT FLYING SERPENTS AND SATYRS LIVED AND THE VERY LIONS MANES WERE BURNT OFF BY THE HEAT
SLOWLY SHE RAISED ONE LITTLE LAZY HAND SLOWLY THE RIPE LIPS OPENED AND IN MOST PURE AND MELODIOUS ATTIC SHE LISPED HER HUGE LOVER'S QUESTION TO THE MONK AND REPEATED IT BEFORE THE BOY COULD SHAKE OFF THE SPELL AND ANSWER ASGARD
THE LONGER HE HOLDS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF ODIN COMES UPON HIM I WATCHED THE BOY'S HANDS ON MY THREAT AND HE WILL MAKE A MAN AND I WILL MAKE HIM ONE HOWEVER WE MAY AS WELL MAKE HIM USEFUL AT ONCE SO GIVE HIM AN OAR WELL ANSWERED HIS NEW PROTECTOR
JUST IN TIME TO STRIKE HIS NEW WEAPON FULL INTO THE THIRD PURSUER'S FACE THE MAN PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD AND RECOILED AGAINST A FELLOW RUFFIAN WHO WAS CLOSE ON HIS HEELS
WHISPERED POOR PELAGIA WHO LOOKS CROSS AT YOU MY QUEEN ROARED THE AMAL
SMID ROSE WITH A BILL IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED ROUND HIM PERHAPS TO SEE WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM HE HALF LIFTED HIS WEAPON TO STRIKE PHILAMMON SEATED LOOKED HIM CALMLY IN THE FACE THE OLD WARRIOR'S EYE CAUGHT THE BANK
WE SHALL HAVE TROUBLE IN THE FLESH AUGUSTINE TELLS US BUT AS I ANSWERED HIM I REALLY HAVE HAD SO LITTLE THEREOF YET THAT MY FAIR SHARE MAY PROBABLY BE RATHER A USEFUL EDUCATION THAN OTHERWISE FAREWELL
I KNOW THE HATRED WHICH THEY BEAR HER THE CRIMES WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTE TO HER HER HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKED LAST NIGHT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CYRIL AND I KNEW PETER'S TONE HE SPOKE TOO GENTLY AND SOFTLY NOT TO MEAN SOMETHING DEVILISH
HAS DESERTED THE METHOD OF THE SEVERE DIALECTICIAN FOR THAT OF THE ELOQUENT LOVER NOT ALTOGETHER SAID HE SMILING IN RETURN FOR SUPPOSE THAT I HAD SAID TO MYSELF WE PLATONISTS AGREE THAT THE SIGHT OF GOD IS THE HIGHEST GOOD
AND COMFORTING THE DYING WITH THE GOOD NEWS OF FORGIVENESS FROM ABOVE TILL THE LARGER NUMBER HAD TO RETURN TO EVENING SERVICE HE HOWEVER WAS KEPT BY HIS SUPERIOR WATCHING AT A SICK BEDSIDE
AS HE FOUND HIS ARM SEIZED BY AN OFFICER AS HE TOOK HIM TO BE FROM THE GOLD ORNAMENTS ON HIS HELMET AND CUIRASS WHO LIFTED HIS VINE STOCK THREATENINGLY OVER THE YOUNG MONK'S HEAD AND DEMANDED WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
OUT OF THE IMPRESSIONS OF PLEASANT THINGS AND HIGH THINGS AND LOW THINGS AND AWFUL THINGS WHICH WE HAD SEEN WITH OUR BODILY EYES WHAT IF I HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE SPIRITUAL IS NOT THE INTELLECTUAL BUT THE MORAL
AND WHETHER IT WAS OR NOT THERE WERE AMBUSCADES OF JEWS SATAN ONLY KNEW HOW STRONG IN EVERY STREET BETWEEN THEM AND IT MIGHT IT NOT BE BETTER TO SECURE THEIR TWO PRISONERS AND THEN ASK FOR FURTHER ORDERS FROM THE ARCHBISHOP
I SAW THE MURDER THEN YOU SAW WHAT YOU CAME HITHER TO SEE WHAT THE WORLD IS AND WHAT JUSTICE AND MERCY IT CAN DEAL OUT YOU WOULD NOT DISLIKE TO SEE GOD'S REPRISALS TO MAN'S TYRANNY OR TO BE A FELLOW WORKER WITH GOD THEREIN
IF SO YOU HAVE ALSO LEARNED TO RULE YOUR FATHER ABBOT HAS TRANSFERRED YOU TO MY TUTELAGE YOU ARE NOW TO OBEY ME AND I WILL WELL SAID GO TO THAT WINDOW THEN AND LEAP INTO THE COURT
HER WATCHWORDS SUCH AS THE TYRANTS OF THE EARTH IN THEIR WEAKNESS AND THEIR DIVISIONS MAY ENVY AND TREMBLE AT BUT CANNOT IMITATE COULD ORESTES RAISE IN THREE HOURS THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WHO WOULD DIE FOR HIM
WHAT IF THEIR EVIDENCE BE AFTER ALL ONLY PROBABILITY I DO NOT WANT MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATION TO PROVE TO ME THAT WHEN A CHILD WAS IN DANGER HIS FATHER SAVED HIM NEITHER DO I HERE
MAY REMAIN FOR EVER FREE FROM ANY SUSPICION OF SELFISH INTEREST OR WEAKNESS OF ENDURANCE AM I DESERTING THE DIALECTIC METHOD NOW HYPATIA YOU ARE STILL SILENT YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME I SEE AT SOME FUTURE DAY
HAVE WE NOT BEEN TRUE MEN TO YOU SON OF THE AESIR NO MAN EVER SAW WULF THE SON OF OVIDA FAIL FRIEND OR FOE THEN WHY DOES HIS FRIEND FAIL HIM WHY DOES HIS FRIEND FAIL HIMSELF
SAMSON JEPHTHA JUDAS MACCABEUS AND ALL THE WORTHIES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THEN STARTED ON THEIR PACIFIC ERRAND PHILAMMON WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN CYRIL STOPPED HIM STAY MY SON
THE DIE WAS CAST AND HE MUST DOWN AND ONWARD WHETHER IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SPIRIT OR THE FLESH OH FOR ONE HOUR OF THE QUIET OF THAT DEAR LAURA AND THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES AT LAST
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN YOU RASCALS ANSWER ME AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH US WE ARE JEWS AND NONE OF YOUR PEOPLE SAID ONE SULKILY NONE OF MY PEOPLE YOU HAVE MURDERED MY PEOPLE NONE OF MY PEOPLE
WITH MANY A YEARNING TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF PLACES THOSE GAY BUILDINGS AND GARDENS WOULD LOOK LIKE ON A NEARER VIEW AND WHAT SORT OF LIFE THE THOUSANDS LED WHO CROWDED THE BUSY QUAYS AND WALKED AND DROVE IN AN ENDLESS STREAM ALONG THE GREAT HIGHROADS WHICH RAN ALONG EITHER BANK
I KEEP TO THE DRESS OF MY FOREFATHERS AMALRIC THE AMAL WHAT DID TO SACK ROME IN MAY DO TO FIND ASGARD IN
ALL DANGER WAS NOW PAST AND THE CACKLING ROSE JUBILANT LOUDER THAN EVER AND MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED TILL DAYLIGHT HAD NOT A WINDOW IN THE COURTYARD BEEN SUDDENLY THROWN OPEN AND THE AWFUL VOICE OF CYRIL COMMANDED SILENCE
HOW MUCH MORE A SON OF GOD IF FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS MAN HAS STRENGTH TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF IN PART GOD WILL HAVE STRENGTH TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF UTTERLY
DON'T ANSWER WULF I KNEW HE WAS HUMBUGGING US ALL ALONG
FEAR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN DEATH FROM CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN TO HIM AS TO THE OTHER INMATES OF THE LAURA A CONTEMPLATION TOO PERPETUAL TO HAVE ANY PARALYSING TERROR IN IT EVEN THEN WHEN LIFE SEEMED JUST ABOUT TO OPEN ON HIM ANEW BUT THE MONK WAS A MAN
DO NOT BEGET DOVES IS THE WORD SON ANYTHING BUT AN EMPTY AND FALSE METAPHOR UNLESS THE SON BE THE PERFECT AND EQUAL LIKENESS OF HIS FATHER HEROES BEGET SONS WORSE THAN THEMSELVES SAYS THE POET
A FIERCE STRUGGLE WHICH STRANGE TO SAY AS IT WENT ON GREW ABSOLUTELY PLEASANT THE WOMEN SHRIEKED TO THEIR LOVERS TO PART THE COMBATANTS BUT IN VAIN NOT FOR WORLDS A VERY FAIR MATCH AND A VERY FAIR FIGHT
GO IN AND WARN HER NOT TO STIR FROM HOME I MUST HEAR MORE OF THIS SAID RAPHAEL WHO SAW THAT THE BOY WAS IN EARNEST COME IN WITH ME AND SPEAK TO HER FATHER NO NOT IN THAT HOUSE NEVER IN THAT HOUSE AGAIN DO NOT ASK ME WHY
WHEREOF THE HARBOUR PANORAMA HAD BEEN THE BRIGHT ONE IN SQUALID MISERY FILTH PROFLIGACY IGNORANCE FEROCITY DISCONTENT NEGLECTED IN BODY HOUSE AND SOUL BY THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES
AND SOMEWHAT SHARPLY DEMANDED HIS BUSINESS THE NAMES OF PAMBO AND ARSENIUS HOWEVER SEEMED TO PACIFY HIM AT ONCE AND THE TREMBLING YOUTH WAS USHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF HIM WHO IN REALITY THOUGH NOT IN NAME
AND A WOMAN AND FOR THAT MATTER SO WERE THE MEN OF HER SCHOOL
I THANK THE LORD THREE SET ON ME WITH DAGGERS SAID PHILAMMON APOLOGETICALLY AND I WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS ONE'S DAGGER AWAY AND BEAT OFF THE TWO OTHERS WITH IT CYRIL SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
SO YOU RAN AWAY EH MY WORTHY FRIEND
WHO ARE THEY ASKED PHILAMMON IN A WHISPER THE SOLDIERS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ANSWERED A WHISPERER TO HIM PHILAMMON WHO WAS AMONG THE LEADERS HAD RECOILED TOO HE HARDLY KNEW WHY AT THAT STERN APPARITION
YOU WILL DIVIDE THESE NOTES AMONG YOURSELVES AND DISTRIBUTE THEM TO TRUSTY AND GODLY CATHOLICS IN YOUR DISTRICTS WAIT ONE HOUR TILL THE CITY BE QUIET AND THEN START AND RAISE THE CHURCH I MUST HAVE
OR KNEW WHO RAISED THE CRY OR OR IN SHORT ALEXANDER'S CHURCH WAS TWO MILES OFF IF IT WAS ON FIRE IT WAS EITHER BURNT DOWN OR SAVED BY THIS TIME IF NOT THE NIGHT AIR WAS TO SAY THE LEAST CHILLY
WHY ARE YOU NOT QUIETLY IN YOUR BEDS YOU ALEXANDRIAN RASCALS ALEXANDER'S CHURCH IS ON FIRE ANSWERED PHILAMMON THINKING THE SHORTEST ANSWER THE WISEST SO MUCH THE BETTER AND THE JEWS ARE MURDERING THE CHRISTIANS
STAY I THINK SHE SAID JUDITH AH THE WIFE OF THE PORTER WHO STANDS AT THE LECTURE ROOM DOOR WHICH GOD CONFOUND A DEVOUT WOMAN FULL OF GOOD WORKS AND SORELY ILL TREATED BY HER HEATHEN HUSBAND PETER
SHOWING ME THAT THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MINGLE UNSHRINKING FOR DUTY'S SAKE WITH ALL THAT IS MOST FOUL AND LOATHSOME THAT THE SUBLIME WAS TO STOOP TO THE MOST MENIAL OFFICES THE MOST OUTWARDLY DEGRADING SELF DENIALS THAT TO BE HEAVENLY
SHE IS MANY A HUNDRED MILES AWAY AH PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT SOMETHING TO ME ME THE PHILOSOPHER YOU NEED NOT HAVE FEARED ME I HAVE NO HEART TO MAKE CONVERTS NOW
THERE THE CAPTAIN FOUND HER AND DREW NEAR FOR A TALK CAPTAIN BRYCE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEA CAPTAIN THAT IS FOUND IN STORY BOOKS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN REAL LIFE HE WAS STOUT AND GRIZZLED AND BROWN AND KIND
WHICH HAD BEEN SO BRIGHT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE STRANGE TO SAY IT WAS THAT LITTLE PUCKER AND THE LOOK OF WORRY WHICH DECIDED DOCTOR CARR
AND MANY COLORED GERANIUMS TWO BIRDS IN CAGES WERE SINGING LOUDLY THE FLOOR WAS WAXED TO A GLASS LIKE POLISH
DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD I DO AND THEN CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SOBS BUT NEVER A SOUND FROM MISSUS ASHE WHO KATY SUSPECTED WAS TOO ILL TO SPEAK
BUT THERE WERE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY INCLINED TO BE HOMESICK ALSO AND IN NEED OF CHEERING AND KATY AS SHE TRIED TO BRIGHTEN THEM GRADUALLY GREW BRIGHT HERSELF AND RECOVERED HER HOPEFUL SPIRITS BURNET PULLED LESS STRONGLY AS IT GOT FARTHER AWAY
THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE FOG WITH A WATERY SMILE AND HIS FAINT BEAMS SHONE ON A CONFUSION OF STONE PIERS HIGHER THAN THE VESSEL'S DECK INTERSECTED WITH CANAL LIKE WATERWAYS
EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BE DISCARDED AS SOON AS THE REAL JOURNEY BEGAN BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND IT MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE SUCH SCHEMES ARE THE PRELIMINARY JOYS OF TRAVEL
DOCTOR CARR'S OBJECTIONS HIS RELUCTANCE TO PART WITH HER MELTED BEFORE THE RADIANCE OF HER SATISFACTION HE HAD NO IDEA THAT KATY WOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT AFTER ALL IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SORT THAT SHE WOULD EVER HAVE MISSUS ASHE COULD WELL AFFORD TO GIVE KATY THIS TREAT HE KNEW
WITH LONG SLENDER WINGS RAISED OVER ITS HEAD AND MEETING TO FORM A POINT ITS PRICE WAS TWENTY FRANCS AND SHE WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO BUY IT FOR CLOVER OR ROSE RED
BEGAN TO EAT WITH A WILL AND KATY HERSELF FELT THAT IF THIS RAILROAD MEAL WAS A SPECIMEN OF WHAT THEY HAD TO EXPECT IN THE FUTURE THEY HAD INDEED COME TO A LAND OF PLENTY FORTIFIED WITH THE SATISFACTORY BREAKFAST
ON THE WHOLE KATY PREFERRED TO HAVE HER OWN SIDE OF THE SHIP THE DOWNWARD ONE FOR IT WAS LESS DIFFICULT TO KEEP HERSELF IN THE BERTH FROM WHICH SHE WAS IN CONTINUAL DANGER OF BEING THROWN
IT WASN'T A BIT KIND OF YOU TO BRING ME TO SUCH A HORRID PLACE IT WAS VERY UNKIND IT WAS CRU EL I WANT TO GO BACK MAMMA TELL THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE ME BACK TO THE LAND MAMMA WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK TO ME OH I AM SO SICK AND SO VERY UN HAPPY
THE FIRST BELL RANG KATY KISSED EVERYBODY QUIETLY AND WENT ON BOARD WITH HER FATHER HER PARTING FROM HIM HARDEST OF ALL TOOK PLACE IN THE MIDST OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE THEN HE HAD TO LEAVE HER AND AS THE WHEELS BEGAN TO REVOLVE SHE WENT OUT ON THE SIDE DECK TO HAVE A LAST GLIMPSE OF THE HOME FACES
TO WHICH IT LED THEM PROVED TO BE QUAINT AND OLD AND VERY PLEASANT OF ASPECT THE LOFTY CHAMBERS WITH THEIR DIMLY FRESCOED CEILINGS AND BEDS CURTAINED WITH FADED PATCH
A GREAT SEA GOING STEAMER IS A LITTLE WORLD IN ITSELF AND GIVES ONE A GLIMPSE OF ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE AND CHARACTERS ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE SPARTACUS WHOM KATY LIKED SO WELL AS SEDATE LITTLE GRETCHEN EXCEPT THE DEAR OLD CAPTAIN
THERE WERE MANY WINDOWS WITH BRIGHT POLISHED PANES AND VERY CLEAN SHORT MUSLIN CURTAINS AND ON THE WINDOW SILLS STOOD ROWS OF THRIFTY POTTED PLANTS IN FULL BLOOM MARIGOLDS BALSAMS NASTURTIUMS
ALL THE TIME THAT SHE TALKED MISSUS BARRETT WAS BUSY IN MAKING MISSUS WARE FOR THAT IT SEEMED WAS THE SICK LADY'S NAME MORE COMFORTABLE AND KATY WAS FEEDING GRETCHEN OUT OF A BIG BOWL FULL OF BREAD AND MILK WHICH ONE OF THE STEWARDS HAD BROUGHT
COAXINGLY YOU WILL BE KINDER THAN THAT I WILL TAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE OF HER AND DO ALL I CAN TO MAKE HER HAPPY IF ONLY YOU WILL CONSENT TO LEND HER TO ME AND I SHALL CONSIDER IT SUCH A FAVOR AND IT IS TO COST YOU NOTHING YOU UNDERSTAND DOCTOR SHE IS TO BE MY GUEST ALL THROUGH
WHO HAD GONE MANY VOYAGES WITH THE CAPTAIN AND KNEW HIS FANCIES KATY DID NOT CARE PARTICULARLY FOR THE DUMPLING BUT SHE VALUED IT AS A MARK OF REGARD AND ALWAYS ATE IT WHEN SHE COULD
I HAVE NO ONE BUT A COUPLE OF OLD AUNTS TOO FEEBLE IN HEALTH TO TRAVEL WITH ME OR TO BE COUNTED ON IN CASE OF ANY EMERGENCY YOU SEE I AM A REAL CASE FOR PITY MISSUS ASHE SPOKE GAYLY BUT HER BROWN EYES WERE DIM WITH TEARS AS SHE ENDED HER LITTLE APPEAL
AND WORTH A HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE HE ALSO GAVE HER FIVE ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS THOSE ARE FOR IMMEDIATE USE HE SAID PUT THE NOTES AWAY CAREFULLY AND DON'T LOSE THEM
AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ALL COMBINED ONLY A GREAT DEAL MORE INTERESTING WE SHALL STICK OUT ALL OVER WITH KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU COME BACK AND THIS MAKES IT A PLAIN DUTY TO GO IF IT WERE ONLY FOR OUR SAKES WITH THESE ZEALOUS PROMISES KATY WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
A CAKE OF SOAP AND A HAMMER AND TACKS TO NAIL THE WHOLE UP WITH MISSUS HALL'S GIFT WAS A WARM AND VERY PRETTY WOOLLEN WRAPPER OF DARK BLUE FLANNEL WITH A PAIR OF SOFT KNITTED SLIPPERS TO MATCH
IT GREW TO BE ONE OF THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS OF SHIP LIFE TO WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THESE DAILY GIFTS AND WHAT DID THE MAIL BRING FOR YOU THIS TIME MISS CARR WAS A QUESTION FREQUENTLY ASKED EACH ARRIVAL KATY THOUGHT MUST BE THE FINAL ONE
MOVING TO AND FRO AND ALL THIS CROWD WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE AND ALL WERE TALKING FRENCH
PEOPLE ALWAYS WISH THIS WHEN THEY ARE STARTING FOR EUROPE
OR TRY TO FANCY HOW YOU'LL FEEL THE FIRST TIME YOU STEP INTO A GONDOLA OR SEE THE MEDITERRANEAN THERE WILL BE A MOMENT I FEEL A FORTY HORSE POWER OF HOUSEKEEPING DEVELOPING WITHIN ME
OLD MISTER WORRETT SENT A NOTE OF ADVICE RECOMMENDING KATY TO TAKE A QUININE PILL EVERY DAY THAT SHE WAS AWAY NEVER TO STAY OUT LATE BECAUSE THE DEWS OVER THERE WERE SAID TO BE UNWHOLESOME AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO DRINK A DROP OF WATER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BOILED
AMY HOWEVER FOUND THEM PERFECTLY ENCHANTING AND WAS NEVER WEARY OF HEARING HOW THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND CAME HOME AGAIN HOW THEY GOT INTO SCRAPES AND GOT OUT OF THEM HOW THEY MADE GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND BROKE THEM ABOUT THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND BIRTHDAY TREATS
AMY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AT LAST AND MUST NOT BE WAKED UP SO THEIR INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN WHISPERS MISSUS ASHE HAD BY NO MEANS GOT TO THE TEA AND TOAST STAGE YET AND WAS FEELING MISERABLE ENOUGH
AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER WHILE MISSUS BARRETT ATTENDS TO YOU I DON'T THINK I CAN BE DRESSED SIGHED POOR MISSUS ASHE
WELL THERE'S ANOTHER VOYAGE OVER AND DONE WITH THANK GOD AND MY MARY IS WHERE SHE WAS IT'S A LOAD TAKEN FROM MY MIND THE MOON HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING SOFTLY ON THE RIVER AS THE CROWDED TENDER LANDED THE PASSENGERS FROM THE SPARTACUS
BUT WHICH IN REALITY LASTED MUCH LONGER IT MIGHT WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY HAVE BEEN CALLED THE ADVENTURES OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVENTURES FOR NOTHING IN PARTICULAR HAPPENED TO EITHER VIOLET OR EMMA DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR LONG DRAWN OUT HISTORY
SHE KNEW OF COURSE THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WERE LIABLE TO BE FOUND SPEAKING THEIR OWN LANGUAGES BUT SOMEHOW THE SPECTACLE OF THE CHATTERING MULTITUDE
THE LAST DAY CAME AS LAST DAYS WILL
I NEVER KNEW HER SO NAUGHTY AND IT SEEMED VERY NEGLECTFUL NOT TO COME TO SEE AFTER YOU POOR DEAR CHILD BUT REALLY I COULDN'T RAISE MY HEAD NEITHER COULD I AND I FELT JUST AS GUILTY NOT TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU SAID KATY WELL
CHAPTER SIX ACROSS THE CHANNEL DAWN HAD GIVEN PLACE TO DAY AND DAY WAS WELL ADVANCED TOWARD NOON BEFORE THE STOUT LITTLE STEAMER GAINED HER PORT IT WAS HOURS AFTER THE USUAL TIME FOR ARRIVAL
ALL IS DARK NOTHING WHISPERS OF EITHER THE JOY OR THE GRIEF NO INSTINCT BIDS US TO DELAY OR TO HASTEN THE OPENING OF THE LETTER OR TELEGRAM OR THE LIFTING OF THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AT WHICH STANDS THE MESSENGER OF GOOD OR ILL
AS THEY WENT IN OR OUT OF THE ROOM ADDRESSED A BOW OR A CIVIL REMARK TO THIS LADY
IS SOMEWHAT QUEER AS YOU MIGHT KNOW MY HOUSE WOULD BE BUT I THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT I SAW SILVERY MARY THE OTHER DAY AND TOLD HER YOU WERE COMING SHE IS THE SAME MOUSE AS EVER I SHALL ASK HER AND SOME OF THE OTHER GIRLS TO COME OUT TO LUNCH ON ONE OF YOUR DAYS
THEN A BOX OF QUININE PILLS THEN A SACHET FOR HER TRUNK THEN ANOTHER BURLESQUE POEM LAST OF ALL A CAKE OF DELICIOUS VIOLET SOAP TO WASH THE SEA SMELL FROM HER HANDS THE LABEL SAID
PAPA I SHOULD THINK NOT CRIED KATY WITH UNSOPHISTICATED HORROR ONE VERY INTERESTING THING WAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY SAILED THE THOUGHT OF WHICH HELPED BOTH KATY AND CLOVER THROUGH THE LAST HARD DAYS WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE NEARLY COMPLETE AND THE FAMILY HAD LEISURE TO FEEL DULL AND OUT OF SPIRITS
AND AWAY THEY DROVE UP THE SOLIDLY PAVED STREETS TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SEE OR DO ANYTHING BUT ENJOY THE SENSE OF BEING ON FIRM LAND ONCE MORE HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO SLEEP IN A BED THAT DOESN'T TIP OR ROLL FROM SIDE TO SIDE SAID MISSUS ASHE
WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS CLOSE AT HAND INQUIRY REVEALED THE FACT THAT NO TRAIN FOR PARIS LEFT TILL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON I AM RATHER GLAD DECLARED POOR MISSUS ASHE FOR I FEEL TOO USED UP TO MOVE
OH WELL FOR THE FISHERMAN'S CHILD ON THE SANDY BEACH AT HIS PLAY
I HATE BEING AT SEA KATY HEARD HER SAY I WON'T STAY IN THIS NASTY OLD SHIP
LOOKING LONGINGLY BACKWARD TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND FISHING OUT OF HER PORT HOLE WITH A CROOKED PIN IN HOPES OF GRAPPLING THE SUBMARINE CABLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE TO HER FAMILY TO COME OUT AT ONCE AND TAKE HER HOME
HE HAD A BLUFF WEATHER BEATEN FACE LIT UP WITH A PAIR OF SHREWD BLUE EYES WHICH TWINKLED WHEN HE WAS PLEASED AND HIS MANNER THOUGH IT WAS FULL OF THE HABIT OF COMMAND WAS QUIET AND PLEASANT HE WAS A MARTINET ON BOARD HIS SHIP
FOUND HERSELF TOO DIZZY AND ILL TO SIT UP A MOMENT LONGER AND THANKFULLY RESORTED TO HER OWN AS THE NIGHT CAME ON THE WIND GREW STRONGER AND THE MOTION WORSE THE SPARTACUS HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A DREADFUL ROLLER
FROM COUSIN HELEN CAME A DELIGHTFUL TRAVELLING BAG LIGHT AND STRONG AT ONCE AND FITTED UP WITH ALL MANNER OF NICE LITTLE CONVENIENCES MISS INCHES SENT A HISTORY OF EUROPE IN FIVE FAT VOLUMES WHICH WAS SO HEAVY THAT IT HAD TO BE LEFT AT HOME
SHE STOOD SO VERY STILL AND SAID SO VERY LITTLE THAT A BYSTANDER NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE DUBBED HER UNFEELING WHILE THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS FEELING TOO MUCH
FOR MISSUS ASHE WAS ASKING PAPA TO LET HER DO THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS THAT SHE MOST LONGED TO DO
LITTLE CLOVER CAME GALLANTLY TO THE FORE WHEN THE FIRST SHOCK OF SURPRISE WAS OVER AND SHE HAD RELIEVED HER MIND WITH ONE LONG PRIVATE CRY OVER HAVING TO DO WITHOUT KATY FOR A YEAR THEN SHE WIPED HER EYES AND BEGAN TO REVEL UNSELFISHLY IN THE IDEA OF HER SISTER'S HAVING SO GREAT A TREAT
THAT KATY STOPPED AT ONCE CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SHE ASKED I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE THE LADY ON THE SOFA OPENED HER EYES SHE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT TO KATY'S DISMAY BEGAN TO CRY INSTEAD
SHE FELT VERY SORRY FOR POOR LITTLE AMY RAGING THERE IN HER HIGH BERTH LIKE SOME IMPRISONED CREATURE BUT SHE WAS POWERLESS TO HELP HER SHE COULD ONLY RESIGN HERSELF TO HER OWN DISCOMFORTS AND TRY TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMETIME THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST MEND
AND WHEN THE WORDS CAME THEY WERE STRANGLED WITH SOBS
WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY IN A VOICE MADE DISCREETLY LOW ABOUT WHAT A PITY IT WAS THAT DEAR MISSUS SO AND SO SHOULD DO THIS OR THAT AND DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU AS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER THING
AS THEY WENT BY BUT KATY WHO IS THAT PERSON WHY DO YOU SPEAK TO HER DON'T YOU SEE THAT THEY ALL DO SHE IS THE LANDLADY I THINK AT ALL EVENTS EVERYBODY BOWS TO HER
SHE HEARD THEM GOING DOWN THE CABIN BUT HOW IT ENDED OR WHETHER THE OWNERS OF THE BOOTS AND SHOES EVER GOT THEIR OWN PARTICULAR PAIRS AGAIN SHE NEVER KNEW TOWARD MORNING THE GALE ABATED THE SEA BECAME SMOOTHER AND SHE DROPPED ASLEEP
I AM TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND KATY AND AMY PASSED THROUGH THE SAME DOOR INTO THE BUFFET AND SAT DOWN AT A LITTLE TABLE IT WAS A PARTICULARLY PLEASANT LOOKING PLACE TO BREAKFAST IN
AND TO BRING HOME AND FRIENDS A GREAT DEAL NEARER WITH A HALF HAPPY HALF TEARFUL PLEASURE KATY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT DISTANCE COUNTS FOR LITTLE IF PEOPLE LOVE ONE ANOTHER
AND COMPETENT TO GRAPPLE WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THERE WAS THE QUEER OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CROSSED ELEVEN TIMES BEFORE AND HAD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCE TO SPARE FOR ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN NOT SO OLD BUT EVEN MORE QUEER
AND THERE WILL BE FEES BUT PAPA PROTESTED KATY OPENING WIDE HER CANDID EYES I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO GIVE ME ANY MONEY AND I'M AFRAID YOU ARE GIVING ME TOO MUCH
AND AS A GENERAL THING NONE OF THEM EVER SAW ANY OF THE OTHERS AGAIN IT IS OFTEN THUS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FELLOW VOYAGERS AT SEA AND IT IS ALWAYS A SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY TO INEXPERIENCED TRAVELLERS THAT IT CAN BE SO
LONGWOOD SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAREST CHILD YOUR NOTE MADE ME DANCE WITH DELIGHT
THEY WILL THINK THAT I AM MIRACULOUSLY IMPROVED BY ONE NIGHT ON FRENCH SOIL BUT NEVER MIND
AND KATY AND CLOVER HAD TAKEN A GOOD MANY HOURS FROM THEIR OWN PREPARATIONS TO HELP HER
HE NOW PROCEEDED TO PREPARE AND PASTE ON TWO SQUARE CARDS LABELLED RESPECTIVELY HOLD AND STATE ROOM MISSUS HALL HAD TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS THE CORRECT THING TO DO
BUT KEEPING AN EYE THE WHILE ON ALL THAT WENT FORWARD MISSUS ASHE WALKED PAST THIS PERSONAGE WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF HER AS AMERICANS ARE WONT TO DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT PRESENTLY THE OBSERVANT KATY NOTICED THAT EVERY ONE ELSE
DOCTOR CARR WHO WAS SOFT HEARTED WHERE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED WAS TOUCHED PERHAPS HIS FACE SHOWED IT FOR MISSUS ASHE ADDED IN A MORE HOPEFUL TONE BUT I WON'T TEASE ANY MORE I KNOW YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME UNLESS YOU THINK IT RIGHT AND NECESSARY AND SHE CONTINUED MISCHIEVOUSLY
IT SEEMED EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LET HER GO AT MISSUS ASHE'S EXPENSE AT THE SAME TIME THE CHANCE WAS SUCH A GOOD ONE AND MISSUS ASHE SO MUCH IN EARNEST AND SO URGENT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE POINT BLANK HE FINALLY CONSENTED TO TAKE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE MAKING HIS DECISION
I ALSO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTILY SORRY A LITTLE LATER HAD SHE DONE SO
THERE WAS THE BAD LITTLE BOY WHOSE PARENTS WERE POWERLESS TO OPPOSE HIM AND WHO CARRIED TERROR TO THE HEARTS OF ALL BEHOLDERS WHENEVER HE APPEARED AND THE PRETTY WIDOW WHO FILLED THE ROLE OF REIGNING BELLE AND THE OTHER WIDOW NOT QUITE SO PRETTY OR SO MUCH A BELLE
IF YOU WOULD GIVE MY LITTLE GIRL SOMETHING TO EAT SHE HAS HAD NOTHING SINCE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE BEEN SO ILL AND NO
I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN KATY AS AN ALLY I AM PRETTY SURE THAT SHE WILL SAY THAT SHE WANTS TO GO AND INDEED KATY'S CRY OF DELIGHT WHEN THE PLAN WAS PROPOSED TO HER SAID THAT SUFFICIENTLY WITHOUT NEED OF FURTHER EXPLANATION
THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE BROWN AND WRINKLED THERE WERE NO PRETTY ONES AMONG THEM BUT THEIR BLACK EYES WERE FULL OF LIFE AND QUICKNESS AND THEIR FINGERS ONE AND ALL CLICKED WITH KNITTING NEEDLES AS THEIR TONGUES FLEW EQUALLY FAST IN THE CHATTER AND THE CHAFFER
AND THAT HEARTS HAVE A TELEGRAPH OF THEIR OWN WHOSE MESSAGES ARE AS SURE AND SWIFT AS ANY OF THOSE SENT OVER THE MATERIAL LINES WHICH LINK CONTINENT TO CONTINENT AND SHORE WITH SHORE LATER IN THE MORNING
WHAT IS THE WORD FOR TRUNK KEY SHE ASKED HERSELF THEY WILL ALL BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
SO IT PROVED FOR AFTER THESE TWO BAD DAYS NONE OF THE PARTY WERE SICK AGAIN DURING THE VOYAGE AMY HAD A CLAMOROUS APPETITE FOR STORIES AS WELL AS FOR COLD BEEF AND TO APPEASE THIS CRAVING KATY STARTED A SORT OF OCEAN SERIAL CALLED
NOW DOCTOR CARR PLEASE PLEASE I AM SURE YOU WON'T DENY ME WHEN I HAVE SO SET MY HEART UPON HAVING HER MISSUS ASHE WAS VERY PRETTY AND PERSUASIVE BUT STILL DOCTOR CARR HESITATED
MISSUS ASHE AND COUSIN HELEN HAD BOTH WARNED HER OF THE INCONVENIENT CONSEQUENCES OF WEIGHT IN BAGGAGE AND BY THEIR ADVICE SHE HAD LIMITED HERSELF TO A SINGLE TRUNK OF MODERATE SIZE BESIDES A LITTLE FLAT VALISE FOR USE IN HER STATEROOM CLOVER'S GIFT WAS A SET OF BLANK BOOKS FOR NOTES
HER FATHER ONLY LAUGHED
CECY SENT A WONDERFUL OLD GOLD AND SCARLET CONTRIVANCE TO HANG ON THE WALL OF THE STATEROOM THERE WERE POCKETS FOR WATCHES AND POCKETS FOR MEDICINES AND POCKETS FOR HANDKERCHIEF AND HAIRPINS IN SHORT THERE WERE POCKETS FOR EVERYTHING
NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND KATY OPENING HER EYES SAW A PROCESSION OF BOOTS AND SHOES OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN LEFT ON THE FLOORS OR AT THE DOORS OF VARIOUS STATEROOMS AND WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LURCHINGS OF THE VESSEL HAD COLLECTED IN THE CABIN
IT CONTAINED A PRETTY LITTLE GREEN BOUND COPY OF EMERSON'S POEMS WITH KATY'S NAME AND TO BE READ AT SEA WRITTEN ON THE FLYLEAF SOMEHOW THE LITTLE GIFT SEEMED TO BRIDGE THE LONG MISTY DISTANCE WHICH STRETCHED BETWEEN THE VESSEL'S STERN AND BOSTON BAY
BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE KATY DOCTOR CARR IT WILL SETTLE ALL MY DIFFICULTIES
AND KATY FOUND THAT HER APPETITE WAS COME AGAIN AND SHE COULD EAT AND ERE'S A LETTER MA'AM WHICH HAS COME FOR YOU BY POST THIS MORNING SAID THE NICE OLD STEWARDESS PRODUCING AN ENVELOPE FROM HER POCKET
YES AND THAT IS WIDE ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH AND SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE REPLIED KATY I FEEL AS IF I COULD SLEEP FOR A FORTNIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THE BAD NIGHTS AT SEA EVERYTHING SEEMED DELIGHTFUL TO HER THE SPACE FOR UNDRESSING
THE LITTLE UNCOMPLAINING THING WAS EVIDENTLY HALF STARVED BUT WITH THE MOUTHFULS THE PINK BEGAN TO STEAL BACK INTO HER CHEEKS AND LIPS
TO THE WAITERS EVEN WELL THERE IS ONE THING I AM GOING TO REFORM
THEY NOW SEEMED TO BE ACTING IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REALLY LOOKED ALIVE AS THEY BUMPED AND TROTTED SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BY TWO IN AT THE DOOR AND UP CLOSE TO HER BEDSIDE THERE THEY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS EXECUTING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DANCE
I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DONE MISTER KETCH HAD AT LENGTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THE INVITATION MUST BE THE WORK OF THE COLLEGE GENTLEMEN ONLY FANCY THE UNHAPPY MAN STANDING OUTSIDE MISSUS JENKINS'S INHOSPITABLE DOOR DECEIVED BETRAYED FAINTING FOR SUPPER
AND GERALD COULDN'T FIND HIS SHIRT HE HAS HAD TO COME OFF IN HIS DIRTY ONE WITH HIS WAISTCOAT BUTTONED UP WON'T MY LADY BE IN A RAGE WHEN SHE SEES HIM GETTING UP AND BREAKFASTING WERE GENERALLY
WHO COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT RECOLLECT MUCH ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR DAY'S LETTERS IT WAS HE WHO GENERALLY POSTED THEM FOR THE OFFICE
AND THERE WAS AN END OF THE CASE AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT FOR NOTHING MORE SATISFACTORY COULD BE GOT OUT OF MISTER GALLOWAY I HAVE BEEN CHECKMATED EJACULATED THE ANGRY BUTTERBY
YOU KNOW FOR YOU CALL PLENTY OF THEM FRIENDS BUT IF YOU WERE ABSENT YOURSELF THAT SUSPICION FALLS TO THE GROUND AGAIN I SAY WHO CAN HAVE TAKEN THE MONEY
BELIEVING HE SAW HIS WAY CLEAR TO A TRIUMPHANT CONVICTION MISTER GALLOWAY WAS QUESTIONED AND FOR SOME MINUTES IT ALL WENT ON SWIMMINGLY ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE LOSS BEFORE YOU CLOSED YOUR LETTER WHO WERE IN YOUR OFFICE
HAD I BEEN LADY AUGUSTA YORKE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO ROLAND THAT MORNING WHEN I SAW HIS SLIP SHOD SLIPPERS AND HIS COLLARLESS NECK IF YOU CAN SHOW NO RESPECT FOR ME SHOW IT FOR THE DAY HALF PAST TEN STRUCK AND LADY AUGUSTA STARTED UP TO FLY TO HER OWN ROOM
IT IS AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY THAT YORKE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT EVEN WERE HE CAPABLE OF SUCH A THING GENEROUSLY SPOKE ARTHUR FROM THE TIME YOU LEFT THE OFFICE YOURSELF SIR UNTIL AFTER THE LETTERS WERE TAKEN OUT OF IT TO BE POSTED HE WAS AWAY FROM IT
YES IN POSITION THAT'S WHERE WE WENT YESTERDAY YOU KNOW MARY JOLLIFFE SAYS SHE NEVER GETS UP UNTIL HALF PAST EIGHT AND THAT IT IS NOT LADY LIKE TO GET UP EARLIER REAL LADIES DON'T MISS CHANNING
NOT YOU I HEARD YOU SAY SO
I SUPPOSE HE CONSIDERS THAT THE LAW IS ON THE OTHER SIDE SIGHED CONSTANCE JUDITH WITH A PETTISH MOVEMENT RETURNED TO HER KITCHEN AND AT THAT MOMENT HAMISH CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE HAD CHANGED HIS DRESS AND HAD A PAIR OF NEW WHITE GLOVES IN HIS HAND
ONCE CONVINCE MISTER GALLOWAY THAT HE WAS NOT THE GUILTY PARTY AND THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD FORTHWITH ISSUE FRESH INSTRUCTIONS TO BUTTERBY FOR THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIR OF THIS ARTHUR FELT CONVINCED HE COULD ONLY BE SILENT AND REMAIN UNDER THE STIGMA THEN
VERY MUCH AT KENSINGTON PALACE I THINK THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT OF ITS TRUTH ONE FACT WE ALL KNOW CAROLINE THE QUEEN RETAINS HER EARLY HABITS AND IMPLANTS THEM IN HER CHILDREN WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD BE HER MAJESTY'S SURPRISE WERE ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS
THE INFORMATION THAT THE SEAL OF THE LETTER WAS UNBROKEN WAS NOW A FURTHER CONFIRMATION HAD HE NEEDED IT AT LEAST IT CONFIRMED THAT THE LETTER HAD NOT BEEN OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THE OFFICE MISTER GALLOWAY PERFECTLY REMEMBERED FASTENING DOWN THE LETTER
AND PRAY WHAT TIME DID YOU COME IN AGAIN WELL SIR YOU SAW ME COME IN IT WAS GETTING ON FOR FIVE O'CLOCK DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN AT ALL BETWEEN THOSE HOURS IT WAS KNIVETT'S FAULT GRUMBLED ROLAND HE KEPT ME
AND THERE MAKE ENOUGH NOISE FOR TEN AND DEFEAT YOUR OWN ENDS INTERRUPTED MISTER GALLOWAY
BACK TO THE HOUSE OF THE HEAD MASTER FOR THE PANTOMIME TO BE PLAYED THROUGH THIS USUALLY WAS FOR THE MASTER AS WISE ON THE SUBJECT AS THEY WERE WOULD LIE THAT MORNING IN BED TO SEND THE MASTER'S SERVANT INTO HIS ROOM WITH THE CARD AND THE MESSAGE
GALLOWAY HAS NEVER TURNED YOU OFF YES HE HAS THEN I'LL GO TOO THUNDERED ROLAND WHO TRUTH TO SAY HAD FLOWN INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION STARTLING JENKINS AND AROUSING MISTER GALLOWAY
WAS HAMISH SPEAKING IN JEST OR EARNEST WITH REGARD TO THE HELPING POINT OF THE AFFAIR A PECULIAR TONE IN HIS VOICE IN SPITE OF ITS LIGHTNESS HAD STRUCK BOTH CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR EACH BEING IN THE SECRET OF HIS
SHE TURNED AWAY TO HIDE HER FACE FROM MISTER YORKE HE FOLLOWED AND OBTAINED FORCIBLE VIEW OF IT IT WAS WET WITH TEARS NAY BUT I DID NOT MEAN TO CARRY IT SO FAR AS TO CAUSE YOU REAL GRIEF MY DEAREST HE SAID IN A CHANGED TONE
A MAN IN BED WITH A PLASTER ON HIS CHEST WAS NOT LIKELY TO INVITE COMPANY TO SUPPER BEFORE HE HAD SEEN HIS WAY OUT OF THE SHOCK OR THE GIRL HAD DONE STARING AT HIM MISSUS JENKINS DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND JOINED THEM HAVING BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE CONVERSATION
HE SAYS HE LEARNS BY THE DESPATCH THAT THE LETTER WAS NOT OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THIS OFFICE NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY DESPATCH COULD TELL HIM THAT
WON'T YOU CATCH IT GENTLEMEN THE HEAD MASTER'S GONE INTO SCHOOL AND IS WAITING FOR YOU MARKING YOU ALL LATE OF COURSE GONE INTO SCHOOL REPEATED GAUNT
KETCH WENT DOWN THE SHOP SNIFFING CURIOUSLY SHARP AS FANCY IS HE COULD NOT SAY THAT HE WAS REGALED WITH THE SCENT OF ONIONS BUT HE SUPPOSED THE SAUCEPAN LID MIGHT BE ON FOR AS WAS KNOWN TO MISTER KETCH AND TO OTHER OF THE INITIATED IN TRIPE MYSTERIES
IT COULD NOT IMPROVE THINGS FARE YOU WELL MY PRETTY SISTER TELL MAMMA I SHALL BE HOME BY ELEVEN IT'LL BE A SAD CUT DOWN FOR EM ALL MUTTERED JUDITH GAZING AT HAMISH ROUND THE KITCHEN DOOR POST WHERE HE'LL FIND MONEY FOR HIS WHITE GLOVES AND THINGS NOW
WITH MY OWN PRIVATE SEAL THAT ALTERS THE CASE OF COURSE SAID ROLAND AFTER A PAUSE SIR I WISH YOU WOULD SET ME TO WORK TO FIND OUT HE IMPULSIVELY CONTINUED I'D GO TO THE POST OFFICE AND
THE MAGISTRATES PRICKED UP THEIR EARS MISTER BUTTERBY PRICKED UP HIS AND LOOKED AT THE WITNESS WHAT DO YOU SAY I WILL NOT SWEAR THAT I PUT THE BANK NOTE INSIDE THE LETTER DELIBERATELY REPEATED MISTER GALLOWAY
I STAMPED IT WITH MY PRIVATE SEAL MISTER ROBERT GALLOWAY RECEIVED THIS ON THE MONDAY MORNING HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE POST BUT FORWARDED THE REPLY BY TELEGRAPH
HOW MANY PEOPLE CALLED IN WHILE CHANNING WAS AT COLLEGE AND YOU WERE KEEPING OFFICE DEMANDED MISTER GALLOWAY ROLAND FIDGETED FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER HE FELT THAT IT MUST ALL COME OUT WHAT A PASSION HE'LL GO INTO WITH ME THOUGHT ROLAND
LADY AUGUSTA CAME IN AND PROFFERED THE INVITATION TO CONSTANCE TO ACCOMPANY THEM CONSTANCE THEN SPOKE OF GIVING THE CHILDREN THE EXTRA TWO HOURS FROM SEVEN TO NINE IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY SHE SAID IF SHE WAS TO DO HER DUTY BY THEM
CONSTANCE HALTED FOR JUDITH CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND SPOKE IN A WHISPER AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF IT MISS CONSTANCE IS THE MONEY GONE GONE ENTIRELY JUDITH
NOT AT ALL ANSWERED LADY AUGUSTA I NEVER CHAPERON TWO CHILDREN TO A CROWDED MEETING PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY TOOK UP THE ROOM OF GROWN UP PERSONS YOU WILL LET ME GO NOT CAROLINE MISS CHANNING PLEADED FANNY WHEN HER MOTHER
IF I DO GO I KNEW HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST LADY AUGUSTA'S INSTRUCTING THEM HERSELF RESUMED MISTER YORKE IT IS NOT A MONTH SINCE THE GOVERNESS LEFT
THE OTHER WOULD STICK TO IT IS IT TRUE SIR THAT HE WAS NOT AT THE OFFICE DURING MY ABSENCE FROM IT ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE CONTINUED TO ARTHUR THAT IS TRUE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO ONE CAN HAVE TOUCHED THE BANK NOTE IN THIS OFFICE SIR HE SAID ALOUD THOSE POOR HALF STARVED POSTMEN MUST HAVE HELPED THEMSELVES TO IT WHEN I ASK FOR YOUR OPINION UPON WHO HAS HELPED THEMSELVES TO IT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO GIVE IT ME
BUT NOT THE NOTE YOU MUST HAVE OMITTED TO ENCLOSE IT WAS THE NEWS IT CONTAINED RELATIVE TO THAT PARTICULAR POINT MISTER GALLOWAY KNEW THAT HE HAD ENCLOSED THE NOTE THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT BOTH HIS CLERKS COULD TESTIFY THAT HE HAD DONE SO
JOE JENKINS SENDS ME DOWN A NOTE AN HOUR AGO TO COME HERE TO SUPPER WITH HIS OLD FATHER AND IT WAS TO BE TRIPE AND ONIONS IT IS TRIPE NIGHT HE CONTINUED RATHER WANDERING FROM THE POINT OF ARGUMENT AS TEARS FILLED HIS EYES
IF AFTERWARDS THAT SEAL MUST HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH PROBABLY BROKEN I'LL DROP A NOTE TO ROBERT AND ASK THE QUESTION HE ROSE FROM HIS BREAKFAST AND PENNED A LINE TO SOUTHAMPTON WHERE AS HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE
WITH HARSH REPROACHES TO MARTHA TOUCHING THEIR SHIRTS AND SOCKS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF ATTIRE THEY SCRAMBLED DOWNSTAIRS SOMEHOW AND FLEW OUT OF THE HOUSE ON THEIR WAY TO THE COLLEGE SCHOOLROOM GERALD DRINKING A FRESHLY MADE SCALDING CUP OF COFFEE
HE TOLD KETCH AND WITH TRUTH THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT WOULD MAKE INQUIRIES IN THE MORNING KETCH WAS FAIN TO DEPART AND TOM RETURNED TO THE SITTING ROOM AND THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR IN A BURST OF LAUGHTER WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ASKED THE PRIMEST LARK RETURNED TOM
FOR ONE THING I DID NOT TAKE THE ORGAN THAT AFTERNOON I WENT AS USUAL BUT MISTER WILLIAMS WAS THERE HIMSELF SO I CAME BACK AT ONCE I WAS ONLY AWAY ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND HOW MANY DID YOU FIND WITH YORKE
SAID CAROLINE REPENTANTLY I WISH MAMMA HAD TRAINED ME TO IT WHEN I WAS A CHILD AS THE DUCHESS OF KENT TRAINED THE PRINCESS I MIGHT HAVE LEARNED TO LIKE IT BY THIS TIME LONG BEFORE THIS SAID CONSTANCE DO YOU REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD SAYING
HERE LYDIA OPEN THE DOOR AND LET HIM OUT CRIED MISSUS JENKINS WAVING HER HAND IMPERATIVELY TOWARDS IT AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN AT WITH YOUR FACE AGAIN CONTINUED SHE AS THE CANDLE HELD BY THAT DAMSEL REFLECTED ITS LIGHT ONE CAN'T SEE IT FOR COLLY
JUST ON THE ESPECIAL AFTERNOON THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TAKEN IT JENKINS BEING AWAY DID NOT SURPRISE HIM IN THE LEAST IT WAS VERY MUCH IN THE LINE OF THE YORKES TO DO SO
BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THE WHOLE SCHOOL CHORISTERS AND KING'S SCHOLARS ASSEMBLED IN THE CLOISTERS BUT INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE SCHOOLROOM FOR EARLY SCHOOL THEY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A DENSE MASS
WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
RIGHT OVER THE KEYHOLE THERE AIN'T A BOY IN THE SCHOOL BUT WHAT'LL COME TO BE HUNG DANCED OLD KETCH IN HIS RAGE HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO FIND THE KEYS BUT TO GO TO THE HEAD MASTER WITH A STORY OF THEIR THEFT IT WAS POSSIBLE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS AIN'T THERE NOBODY AT HOME THE GIRL HEARD AND CAME FORTH THE SAME CANDLE IN HAND WHO BE YOU CALLING TO I'D LIKE TO KNOW MY NAME'S LIDYAR IF YOU PLEASE WHERE'S YOUR MISSIS RESPONDED KETCH SUFFERING THE NAME TO DROP INTO ABEYANCE IS SHE GONE OUT FOR THE TRIPE
HE DID NOT PREACH A SERMON
AND VOWING THE MOST INTENSE VENGEANCE UPON THE COLLEGE BOYS THE OCCURRENCE NATURALLY CAUSED HIM TO CAST BACK HIS THOUGHTS TO THAT OTHER TRICK THE LOCKING HIM INTO THE CLOISTERS IN WHICH JENKINS HAD BEEN A FELLOW VICTIM AND HE DOUBLED HIS FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER
THE FACT IS YOU ARE TWO BIRDS OF A FEATHER STORMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO WHEN ONCE ROUSED WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN WOULD SAY ANYTHING THAT CAME UPPERMOST JUST OR UNJUST THE ONE WON'T TELL TALES OF THE OTHER IF
CONSTANCE THAT IS NO ANSWER OH DO NOT DO NOT WILLIAM DO NOT YOU THROW THIS TEMPTATION IN MY WAY THAT OF CHOOSING BETWEEN YOURSELF AND A PLAIN DUTY THAT LIES BEFORE ME THE TEMPTATION AS YOU CALL IT
AND I AM SORRY TO SAY I WAS SEDUCED INTO STOPPING OUT WITH HIM LONGER THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE MISTER GALLOWAY STARED AT ROLAND AT WHAT TIME DID YOU GO OUT HE ASKED JUST AFTER YOU DID SIR THE BELL WAS GOING FOR COLLEGE
THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
YOU WON'T REQUIRE TO DISMISS YOURSELF SAID MISTER GALLOWAY SIT DOWN SIR AND GO ON WITH YOUR WORK
HE HAD CAST A DOUBT UPON WHETHER ARTHUR CHANNING HAD POSTED THE LETTERS HIMSELF ARTHUR ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD DONE SO AND MISTER GALLOWAY BELIEVED HIM
OH YES REPLIED CAROLINE HER LISTLESS MOOD CHANGING TO ANIMATION ANECDOTES OR ANYTHING OF THAT DESULTORY KIND BEING FAR MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE YOUNG LADY THAN LESSONS
PREPARING THEIR LESSONS FANNY CAME RUNNING IN HER HAIR IN CURL PAPERS SOME BREAD AND BUTTER IN HER HAND CARRY HAS NOT FINISHED HER BREAKFAST MISS CHANNING QUOTH SHE SHE WAS LAZY THIS MORNING I THINK SOME ONE ELSE WAS LAZY ALSO SAID CONSTANCE GENTLY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER
MISSIS'LL BE HERE SOON SAID SHE KETCH ENTERED THE PARLOUR AND SAT DOWN THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE GRATE BUT NO LIGHT AND THERE WERE NOT SO FAR AS KETCH COULD SEE ANY PREPARATIONS YET FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE IT DOWNSTAIRS IN THE KITCHEN SOLILOQUIZED HE
FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT THEY HAD NOT THE MOST DISTANT IDEA WHAT THEIR OFFENCE COULD HAVE BEEN GAUNT ENTERED AND THE REST TROOPED IN AFTER HIM THE HEAD MASTER SAT AT HIS DESK IN STERN STATE THE OTHER MASTERS WERE IN THEIR PLACES
THE APPEAL BROUGHT FORTH NO FURTHER RESULT THAN THE OTHER HAD DONE THE MASTER CONTINUED
BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME FIXING THE MUSTARD WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN HIS SPIRITS DROPPED AGAIN AND HE GREW RATHER EXASPERATED GO UP AND ASK YOUR MISSIS HOW LONG I BE TO WAIT HE GROWLED I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE AT SEVEN FOR SUPPER AND NOW IT'S A'MOST EIGHT
WHAT IF I DO FORBID IT SHE WALKED A LITTLE FORWARD LEAVING THE CARNATION BED AND HALTED UNDER THE SHADE OF THE DARK CEDAR TREE HER HEART AND COLOUR ALIKE FADING MISTER YORKE FOLLOWED AND STOOD BEFORE HER WILLIAM I MUST DO MY DUTY
HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AGAIN HAD IT BEEN ABSTRACTED WHILE THE LETTER WAS STILL IN HIS OFFICE OR ON ITS WAY TO THE POST OR IN ITS TRANSMISSION TO VENTNOR IF IN THE OFFICE ARGUED MISTER GALLOWAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE I SEALED IT
TO THE OFFICE TO MORROW SHOULD THERE BE NO RELAPSE HE ENJOINS STRICT QUIET FOR TO DAY AND MISSUS JENKINS IS DETERMINED THAT HE SHALL HAVE QUIET
MARTHA WITHDREW WITH THE CHILD AND JUST THEN CAROLINE CAME IN FULL OF EAGERNESS MISS CHANNING MAMMA SAYS SHE SHALL TAKE ONE OF US TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE TO FIX UPON MIND YOU FIX UPON ME
I CANNOT SAY A HALT BUT HE WAS IN FULL POSSESSION OF HIS EYES JUST THEN NO DOUBT HE WAS THEN WHAT SHOULD HINDER HIS SEEING YOU PUT THE NOTE INTO THE LETTER I WILL NOT SWEAR THAT I PUT THE NOTE INTO THE LETTER
HOW COULD A DESPATCH TELL HIM WHO TOOK IT OR WHO DID NOT UNLESS IT WAS A DESPATCH FROM THOSE SPIRIT RAPPERS MESMERISTS OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES THEY PROFESS TO SHOW YOU WHO YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROLAND LAUGHED AS HE SPOKE
SAID HAMISH WITH HIS SUNNY SMILE YOU CANNOT HELP IN IT YOU KNOW HAMISH
SHE REJOINED HER COUNTENANCE LIGHTING UP HOW COULD YOU DOUBT ME I WISH I COULD MAKE A HOME AT ONCE TO TAKE YOU TO BUT AS YOU MUST REMAIN IN THIS A LITTLE LONGER IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT YOU SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO ITS MAINTENANCE
I'LL NOT STOP IN A PLACE WHERE THAT SORT OF INJUSTICE GOES ON HE'LL BE TURNING ME OUT NEXT CATCH ME STOPPING FOR IT ARE YOU TAKEN CRAZY MISTER ROLAND YORKE THE QUESTION PROCEEDED FROM HIS MASTER WHO CAME FORTH TO MAKE IT
STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
ROLAND MADE HIS APPEARANCE A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR AND A RULER IN HIS HAND MORE SHOW THAN WORK SARCASTICALLY EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY NOW SIR I HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING MISTER ARTHUR CHANNING ABOUT THIS UNPLEASANT BUSINESS
JUST LIKE HIM EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE WHILE YOUR BROTHER HAMISH WAS WAITING IN THE OFFICE WE MUST ASCERTAIN FROM HIM WHO CAME IN HE TOLD ME NO ONE CAME IN REPEATED ARTHUR RUBBISH
LAST FRIDAY AFTERNOON DURING CHANNING'S HOUR FOR COLLEGE WHAT NOT AT ALL EXCLAIMED MISTER GALLOWAY WHO HAD NOT SUSPECTED THAT YORKE WAS ABSENT SO LONG AS I SAY IT'S MY LUCK TO BE FOUND OUT
BE I IN TIME DEMANDED KETCH HIS VOICE SHAKING IN TIME FOR WHAT RESPONDED THE GIRL WHY FOR SUPPER SAID KETCH PENETRATING INTO THE SHOP WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY A CANDLE THAT STOOD ON THE COUNTER THE ONE THE GIRL HAD BROUGHT IN HER HAND
DID NOT MAKE THEM OTHER FIVE BY WASTING HIS DAYS IN IDLENESS OH CAROLINE FANNY COME CLOSER AND LISTEN TO ME YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOOD MUST BE USED NOT ABUSED OR WASTED
BUT THE VERY NARROW RADIUS THAT THE AFFAIR OF THE LETTER APPEARED TO BE DRAWING ITSELF INTO IF ROLAND WAS ABSENT HE COULD NOT HAVE HAD HALF THE TOWN IN TO CHATTER AND IF ARTHUR CHANNING ASSERTED THAT NONE HAD BEEN IN MISTER GALLOWAY COULD GIVE CREDENCE TO ARTHUR
AND ITS BEING SO VERY NEAR OUR OWN HOUSE WOULD BE A GREAT POINT OF CONSTANCE INTERRUPTED A VOICE AT THIS JUNCTURE
BUT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS TO ME WERE THAT YOU DID PUT THE NOTE INTO THE LETTER CRIED MISTER BUTTERBY INTERRUPTING THE EXAMINATION I WILL NOT SWEAR IT
SHE DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE UP HER ARGUMENT IT'S SO VERY LOW LIVED TO GET UP WITH THE SUN I DON'T THINK REAL LADIES EVER DO IT YOU THINK REAL LADIES WAIT UNTIL THE SUN HAS BEEN UP A FEW HOURS AND WARMED THE EARTH FOR THEM
ENABLES ME TO SAY THAT THE LETTER WAS NOT OPENED AFTER IT LEFT MY HANDS THE DESPATCH YOU ARE SO CURIOUS ABOUT WAS FROM MY COUSIN TELLING ME THAT THE SEAL REACHED HIM INTACT
BUT FOR ALL THE OBSERVANCE IT OBTAINED
HAVE YOU FULLY MADE UP YOUR MIND HE AT LENGTH ASKED YES I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MAMMA FOR INDEED SHE AND I BOTH SEEM TO HAVE ANTICIPATED THIS
THE MAIDS MEANWHILE ENJOYED THEIR OWN LEISURELY BREAKFAST IN THE KITCHEN REGALING THEMSELVES WITH HOT COFFEE POACHED EGGS BUTTERED TOAST AND A DISH OF GOSSIP AT TEN LADY AUGUSTA WHO MADE A MERIT OF ALWAYS RISING TO BREAKFAST ON A SUNDAY
LANYARD TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD SOONER PAY THE GUILLOTINE THE PENALTY CONSULTING HIS WATCH HE FOUND THE HOUR TO BE NO LATER THAN HALF PAST FOUR SO SWIFTLY
I SEEK BUT TO AFFORD MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY YOU LEAD SUCH A BUSY LIFE MY FRIEND ROMPING ABOUT EUROPE HERE ONE DAY GOD KNOWS WHERE THE NEXT THAT ONE MUST MAKE ONE'S BEST OF YOUR SPARE MOMENTS YOU WILL JOIN US SURELY REALLY I CANNOT TO NIGHT ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
HE REFRAINED FROM TURNING UP THE LIGHTS IMMEDIATELY WITH A FANCY OF IMPISH INSPIRATION THAT IT WOULD BE AMUSING TO LEARN WHAT MOVE RODDY WOULD MAKE WHEN THE TENSION BECAME TOO MUCH EVEN FOR HIS TRAINED NERVES
AND BY THIS MEANS SEVERAL FINE FISH WERE ENMESHED IN THE NET OF SUSPICION CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED AND ONE BY ONE LET GO ALL EXCEPT ONE THE VERITABLE MAN HIM THEY SEDULOUSLY WATCHED SHADOWING HIM ACROSS EUROPE AND BACK AGAIN
HE MUST THINK SWIFTLY IN CONTEMPLATION OF INSTANT ACTION WERE HE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF WITHOUT THE PACK'S KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT GRANTED THEN HE MUST FLY THIS STRICKEN FIELD OF PARIS BUT HOW DE MORBIHAN HAD PROMISED THAT POPINOT'S CREATURES WOULD GUARD EVERY OUTLET AND LANYARD DIDN'T DOUBT HIM
THAT IS CLEAR I TRUST TOO DEEP FOR ME MY FRIEND THE ELDERLY MAN CONFESSED IMPENETRABLE RETICENCE THE COUNT EXPOUNDED SENTENTIOUS AND ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY ISN'T POSSIBLE IN THE HUMAN RELATIONS
SO IT APPEARED THAT THIS AGENT OF THE PACK HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO PUT THE LONE WOLF TO SLEEP FOR AN HOUR OR TWO OR MORE PERHAPS NOT PERMANENTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE WAY LONG ENOUGH FOR THEIR OCCULT PURPOSES
HE HAD LEFT THE SHADES DOWN AND THE HANGINGS DRAWN AT BOTH WINDOWS AND SINCE THESE HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED SOMETHING NEARLY APPROACHING COMPLETE DARKNESS REIGNED IN THE ROOM BUT THOUGH PROMPTLY ON ENTERING HIS FINGERS CLOSED UPON THE WALL SWITCH NEAR THE DOOR
THE FIRST REMARK OVERHEARD BY LANYARD CAME FROM THE ELDERLY AMERICAN FOLLOWING A PAUSE AND A CONSULTATION OF HIS WATCH QUARTER TO ELEVEN HE ANNOUNCED
ALL ARE GONE THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES LANYARD QUOTED IN VINDICTIVE MELANCHOLY DAMN EM HAPPILY
IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT DE MORBIHAN'S IDENTIFICATION OF LANYARD WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE AT LEAST BY INNUENDO HAD BEEN UNINTENTIONAL BUT SOMEHOW LANYARD DIDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD THE TWO QUESTIONS TROUBLED HIM SORELY
COARSENED PERHAPS BUT RECOGNIZABLY A REPLICA OF THAT MICHAEL LANYARD WHO CONFRONTED HIM EVERY MORNING IN HIS SHAVING GLASS ALMOST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE RESIDING IN THE SCRUBBY BLACK MOUSTACHE THAT SHADOWED THE AMERICAN'S UPPER LIP
UPTURNED TO THE GLARE WAS THAT OF THE AMERICAN WHO HAD MADE A FOURTH IN THE CONCERT OF THE PACK MISTER SMITH QUICKLY UNLATCHING THE MASK LANYARD REMOVED IT BUT THE COUNTENANCE THUS EXPOSED TOLD LITTLE MORE THAN HE KNEW
MOMENTARILY REVEALED BY THE CORNER LIGHT AS HE DARTED ACROSS TO TAKE POSITION BY THE DOOR THIS ANIMAL WITH SICKLY FACE AND POINTED CHIN WITH DIRTY MUFFLER ROUND ITS CHICKEN NECK SHODDY COAT CLOTHING ITS SLOPING SHOULDERS
BUT ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NO RODDY WERE DISPOSED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
RODDY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANTICIPATED ERGO WHATEVER THE DETECTIVE'S BUSINESS IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH LANYARD FURTHERMORE BEFORE QUITTING THE LOBBY RODDY PAUSED LONG ENOUGH TO INSTRUCT THE VESTIAIRE TO HAVE A FIRE LAID IN HIS ROOM SO HE WAS STOPPING AT TROYON'S AND DIDN'T CARE WHO KNEW IT
MONSIEUR BANNON AND I HE HAS NOT SEEN PARIS IN TWENTY YEARS HE TELLS ME WELL IT WILL BE AMUSING TO SHOW HIM WHAT CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ALL THAT TIME ONE REGRETS MADEMOISELLE IS TOO FATIGUED TO ACCOMPANY US BUT YOU MY FRIEND NOW IF YOU WOULD CONSENT TO MAKE OUR THIRD IT WOULD BE MOST AMIABLE OF YOU
AS YOU WILL MY FRIEND HE GRANTED BUT SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND WELL YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING US ASK ANY PLACE ALONG THE REGULAR ROUTE WE SEE FAR TOO LITTLE OF ONE ANOTHER MONSIEUR
ALL IN A SINGLE MOVEMENT SO SWIFT AND DEFT THAT THE DRUG WAS DELIVERED BEFORE THE PAIN COULD STARTLE THE VICTIM FROM HIS COMA AS FOR THAT THE MAN CAME TO QUICKLY ENOUGH
HERE THEN WAS THAT RESEMBLANCE WHICH HAD BAFFLED HIM AND NOW THAT HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY THAT IT WAS UNFLATTERINGLY CLOSE FEATURE FOR FEATURE THE FACE OF THE MURDERER REPRODUCED HIS FACE
COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR A TUNELESS VOICE CONTENTEDLY HUMMING SALLY IN OUR ALLEY A RENDITION PUNCTUATED BY ONE HEAVY THUMP AND THEN ANOTHER AND THEN BY A HEARTFELT SIGH OF RELIEF AS RODDY KICKED OFF HIS BOOTS AND FOLLOWED BY THE TAPPING OF A PIPE AGAINST GRATE BARS
ONE MIGHT PASS FOR AN AMERICAN OF POSITION AND WEALTH
AND SLOWLY GULPING DOWN A SECOND BOTTLE OF BASS
A LONG CONVULSIVE SIGH SHOOK THE AMERICAN'S BODY AND HE RESTED WITH THE IMMOBILITY OF THE DEAD SAVE FOR THE SLOW BUT STEADY RISE AND FALL OF HIS BOSOM LANYARD THOUGHTFULLY REVIEWED THESE PHENOMENA
BEYOND THE DOOR DARKNESS SILENCE MUSTERING UP ALL HIS COURAGE THE ADVENTURER STRODE DETERMINEDLY INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM
I'M NOT YET FREE TO STATE INDEED I MAY BE INDISCREET IN SAYING AS MUCH AS I DO YET AMONG FRIENDS HIS SHRUG IMPLIED THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED WAITERS WERE UNHUMAN AND THE OTHER GUESTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT NON EXISTENT
IN HIS ABSTRACTION HE WANDERED TO A CHAIR OVER WHOSE BACK HUNG A LIGHT DRESSING GOWN OF WINE COLOURED SILK WHICH BECAUSE IT WOULD PACK IN SMALL COMPASS WAS IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING WITH HIM ON HIS TRAVELS LANYARD HAD LEFT THIS THROWN ACROSS HIS BED
REST ASSURED THE CHIEF OF THE SURETE HAS LAID HIS PLANS HIS WEB IS SPUN AND SO ARTFULLY THAT I THINK OUR UNSOCIABLE OUTLAW WILL SOON BE MAKING FRIENDS IN THE PRISON OF THE SANTE BUT NOW WE MUST ADJOURN ONE IS SORRY IT HAS BEEN SO VERY PLEASANT
A DEMURE OLD FASHIONED TYPE WELL POISED BUT UNASSUMING FETCHINGLY GOWNED AND WITH SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUALITY OF TASTE BUT NOT CONSPICUOUSLY A GIRL WITH SOFT BROWN HAIR AND SOFT BROWN EYES PRETTY NOT EXTRAVAGANTLY SO WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE
MOON LIKE MASK WITH WAXED MOUSTACHES WOMANISH EYES AND NEVER FAILING GRIN
DESPITE THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR WHICH HAD BY NOW TURNED TEN O'CLOCK THE RESTAURANT HAD A DOZEN TABLES OR SO IN THE SERVICE OF GUESTS PLEASANTLY ENGAGED IN LENGTHENING OUT AN AGREEABLE EVENING WITH DESSERT
AND NO SHADOW COULD HAVE MADE LESS NOISE THAN HE SLIPPING CAT FOOTED ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND UP THE STAIRS AVOIDING WITH SUPER DEVELOPED SENSITIVENESS EVERY LIFT THAT MIGHT COMPLAIN BENEATH HIS TREAD IN A TRICE HE WAS AGAIN IN THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO HIS BED CHAMBER
THEREAFTER HIS PROGRESS WAS PRACTICALLY NOISELESS THE SMALLER DOOR YIELDED TO HIS TOUCH WITHOUT A MURMUR INSIDE HE CLOSED IT GENTLY AND STOOD A MOMENT LISTENING WITH ALL HIS SENSES NOT WITH HIS EARS ALONE BUT WITH EVERY NERVE AND FIBRE OF HIS BEING
YOU DON'T TELL ME THE OLDER MAN EXCLAIMED HAVE THEY PICKED UP THE SCENT AT LAST
UNQUESTIONABLY THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOW MOST STRIKING THE AMERICAN WOULD READILY PASS FOR MICHAEL LANYARD THIS MUCH ACCOMPLISHED HE PURSUED HIS PREPARATIONS IN FEVERISH HASTE IN SPITE OF THIS HE OVERLOOKED NO DETAIL
I'M SORRY LANYARD EXCUSED HIMSELF BUT AS YOU SEE I AM ONLY JUST IN FROM THE RAILROAD A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY YOU ARE VERY GOOD BUT I GOOD DE MORBIHAN EXCLAIMED WITH VIOLENCE I ON THE CONTRARY I AM A VERY SELFISH MAN
AND THE PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED DESPITE ITS PARTIAL FAILURE DESPITE THE SWIFT REVERSE CHANCE AND LANYARD'S CUNNING HAD METED OUT TO THE PACK'S AGENT IT WAS HIS DRESSING GOWN THAT WAS SATURATE WITH RODDY'S BLOOD JUST AS THEY WERE HIS GLOVES PILFERED FROM HIS LUGGAGE
BLACK MUST TURN UP EVERY SO OFTEN IN A RUN OF RED EVERY GAMBLER KNOWS AS MUCH AND WHAT WAS MICHAEL LANYARD BUT A COMMON GAMBLER
BY NOW THE CONVERSATION HAD CAUGHT THE INTEREST OF SEVERAL LOITERING WAITERS
WHERE THEN WAS THE OBJECT OF THIS SO SEDULOUSLY DISSEMBLED INTEREST LANYARD WASN'T SLOW TO READ THIS RIDDLE TO HIS SATISFACTION IN AS FAR THAT IS AS IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO FEEL STILL MORE CERTAIN THAT RODDY'S QUARRY WAS ANOTHER THAN HIMSELF
BUT WITH A SLOW SMILE THAT RENDERED HER LITTLE LESS THAN BEAUTIFUL IN ALL LANYARD THOUGHT THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT IS PREDESTINED TO COMFORT MANKIND WHOSE STRONGEST INSTINCT IS THE MATERNAL SHE TOOK LITTLE PART IN THE CONVERSATION
YOU MUST KNOW MY FRIENDS BUT COME AND SEIZING LANYARD'S HANDS WHEN THAT ONE SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY ROSE IN RESPONSE TO THIS SURPRISINGLY OVER EXUBERANT GREETING
FURROWED SEAMED TWISTED A MASK OF MORTAL ANGUISH AND ONCE WHEN THIS ONE LOOKED UP AND CASUALLY ENCOUNTERED LANYARD'S GAZE THE ADVENTURER WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HIMSELF STARING INTO EYES LIKE THOSE OF A DEAD MAN
AND WAS READY TO BID ADIEU TO HIMSELF TO THAT MICHAEL LANYARD WHOM PARIS KNEW THE INSENTIENT MASQUERADER ON THE FLOOR HAD CALLED HIMSELF GOOD ENOUGH SMITH
SOMETHING SMALL AND SILVER BRIGHT THAT CAUGHT LANYARD'S EYE PICKING IT UP HE EXAMINED WITH INTEREST A SMALL HYPODERMIC SYRINGE LOADED TO THE FULL CAPACITY OF ITS GLASS CYLINDER PLUNGER DRAWN BACK ALL READY FOR INSTANT SERVICE
LANYARD GENTLY PINCHED THE SMALL END OF A CIGAR DIPPED IT INTO HIS COFFEE AND LIGHTED IT WITH NOT SO MUCH AS A SUSPICION OF TREMOR HIS BRAIN HOWEVER
SHE FLUSHED PRETTILY AS SHE NODDED SMILING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
AND A SECRET BETWEEN TWO IS A PROLIFIC BREEDER OF PLATITUDES GRANTED THIS LINE OF REASONING THE LONE WOLF IS OF NECESSITY NOT ONLY UNMARRIED BUT PRACTICALLY FRIENDLESS OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF HIS WILL OBVIOUSLY COMPRISE YOUTH COURAGE IMAGINATION
IT WAS QUITE AS GLOOMY AND EMPTY AS IT HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES AGO YET WITH A DIFFERENCE A SOMETHING IN ITS ATMOSPHERE THAT MADE HIM NOD BRIEFLY IN CONFIRMATION OF THAT SUSPICION WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK SO STEALTHILY FOR ONE THING RODDY HAD STOPPED SNORING
HE WAS IN BERLIN AT THE TIME OF THE FAMOUS RHEINART ROBBERY THOUGH HE COMPASSED THAT COUP WITHOUT DETECTION HE WAS IN VIENNA WHEN THE BRITISH EMBASSY THERE WAS LOOTED
HALF EXPECTING IT TO QUICKEN WITH INSTANT AND VIOLENT ACTION BUT IT RESPONDED IN NO WAY WITH A NOD OF SATISFACTION HE SHIFTED THE LIGHT UNTIL IT MARKED DOWN THE NEAREST ELECTRIC BULB WHICH PROVED IN LINE WITH HIS INFERENCE
A RATHER HIGH ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE AND A SOCIAL POSITION LET US SAY RATHER AN OSTENSIBLE BUSINESS ENABLING HIM TO TRAVEL AT WILL HITHER AND YON WITHOUT EXCITING COMMENT SO FAR GOOD
THE SQUEAL OF A WINDOW LOWERED FOR VENTILATION THE CLICK OF AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE CREAKING OF BED SPRINGS FINALLY AND BEFORE LANYARD HAD FINISHED DRESSING THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD BEGAN PLACIDLY TO SNORE OF COURSE
LANYARD ENVELOPED HIMSELF IN A LONG FULL SKIRTED COAT CLAPPED ON AN OPERA HAT AND WENT OUT NOISILY LOCKING THE DOOR HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE LEFT IT WIDE BUT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO PRETEND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE BED CHAMBER KEYS AT TROYON'S WERE INTERCHANGEABLE
THAT HE MIGHT NOT ESCAPE BEFORE POLICE COULD BE SENT TO FIND HIM THERE HE COULD NO LONGER DOUBT THAT DE MORBIHAN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AT THE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OF HARMONY SOLELY TO DETAIN HIM IF NEED BE AND AFFORD SMITH TIME TO FINISH HIS HIDEOUS JOB AND SET THE TRAP FOR THE SECOND VICTIM
BAGGY CORDUROY TROUSERS FLAPPING ROUND ITS BONY SHANKS THIS WAS POPINOT'S AND BUT ONE OF A THOUSAND DIFFERING IN NO ESSENTIAL SAVE DEGREE OF VICIOUSNESS
JUST AT PRESENT REASONING FROM NOISES AUDIBLE THROUGH THE BOLTED DOOR THAT COMMUNICATED WITH THE ADJOINING BED CHAMBER THE BUSINESS OF A SLEUTH SEEMED TO COMPRISE GOING TO BED LANYARD SHAVING AND DRESSING
LANYARD FOR ONE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HIM THE PROPEREST COMPANY OR THE BEST PARISIAN CICERONE FOR AN AILING AMERICAN GENTLEMAN BLESSED WITH INDEPENDENT MEANS AND AN ATTRACTIVE DAUGHTER PARIS ON THE OTHER HAND PARIS WHO FORGIVES EVERYTHING TO HIM WHO CONTRIBUTES TO HER AMUSEMENT
THE ROGUE HAS HAD A WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL CAREER THANKS TO HIS DISPENSING WITH CONFEDERATES AND CONFINING HIS DEPREDATIONS TO JEWELS AND SIMILAR VALUABLES PORTABLE AND EASY TO CONVERT INTO CASH YET HE ADDED NODDING SAGELY ONE ISN'T AFRAID TO PREDICT HIS RACE IS ALMOST RUN
EVIDENTLY SIGNALING ANOTHER SENTINEL ON A CORNER OUT OF LANYARD'S RANGE OF VISION HEREIN WAS ADDITIONAL PROOF IF ANY LACKED THAT DE MORBIHAN HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE DISPOSITION OF POPINOT THIS ANIMAL IN THE STREET
WHEN LANYARD CLASPED IT WAS COLD AS COLD AS ICE AND AS THEIR EYES MET THAT ABOMINABLE COUGH LAID HOLD OF THE MAN AS IT WERE BY THE NAPE OF HIS NECK AND SHOOK HIM VICIOUSLY BEFORE IT HAD FINISHED WITH HIM HIS SENSITIVELY COLOURED FACE WAS PURPLE AND HE WAS GASPING BREATHLESS AND INFURIATED
STEPPING OUT HE SLAMMED THE DOOR AND STRODE BRISKLY ROUND THE CORNER AS IF MAKING FOR THE CAB RANK THAT LINES UP ALONG THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS SIDE OF THE RUE DE MEDICIS HIS BOOT HEELS MADE A CHEERFUL RACKET IN THAT QUIET HOUR HE WAS QUITE AUDIBLY GOING AWAY FROM TROYON'S
SPECULATING WHETHER DE MORBIHAN WERE TELLING THE TRUTH OR ONLY BOASTING FOR HIS OWN GLORIFICATION DO GO ON PLEASE THE GIRL BEGGED PRETTILY I CAN DENY YOU NOTHING MADEMOISELLE WELL THEN FROM WHAT LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU HE ADVISED CHEERFULLY
PLUNGED ACROSS THE ROOM WITH BOTH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED AND A CRY OF JOYOUS SURPRISE NOT REALLY JUSTIFIED BY THEIR RATHER SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCESHIP AH AH HE CLAMOURED VIVACIOUSLY IT IS MONSIEUR LANYARD WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT PAINTINGS BUT THIS IS DELIGHTFUL MY FRIEND ONE GRAND PLEASURE
BUT ONLY TO HAVE HIS CLEARING SENSES MET AND DASHED BY THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL STAMPING A COLD RING UPON HIS TEMPLE LIE PERFECTLY QUIET MY DEAR MISTER SMITH LANYARD ADVISED DON'T SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER GIVE THE GOOD DOPE A CHANCE
HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO A WINDOW AND FROM ONE EDGE OF ITS SHADE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE STREET HE WAS IN TIME TO SEE A STUNTED HUMAN SILHOUETTE DETACH ITSELF FROM THE SHADOW OF A DOORWAY ON THE OPPOSITE WALK MOVE TO THE CURB AND WAVE AN ARM
THE GIRL BENT FORWARD WITH A LOOK OF EAGER INTEREST THE LONE WOLF WHO IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM IN AMERICA MADEMOISELLE NO
AND SET HIS BACK AGAINST IT AS IF TO BAR OUT THAT REEKING SHAMBLES HE WAS VERY PALE HIS FACE DRAWN WITH HORROR AND HE WAS POWERFULLY SHAKEN WITH NAUSEA THE PLOT WAS DAMNABLY PATENT
MADAME NO LONGER OCCUPIED THE DESK OF THE CAISSE ENQUIRIES SO DISCREETLY WORDED AS TO BE UNCOMPROMISING ELICITED FROM THE MAITRE D'HOTEL THE INFORMATION THAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT THESE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE OLD PROPRIETOR WAS DEAD
YOU FILL US WITH ENVY YOU HAVE THE SOULS OF POETS AND THE WEALTH OF PRINCES BUT WE MUST COME TO PARIS TO FIND BEAUTIFUL THINGS FOR OUR WOMEN FOLK TAKE CARE THOUGH LEST YOU GO TOO FAR MONSIEUR BANNON HOW SO TOO FAR YOU MIGHT ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE LONE WOLF
AND HE WAS WONDERING SUBCONSCIOUSLY WHAT USE THE MAN HAD THOUGHT TO MAKE OF IT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO SHIFT IT TO THE CHAIR BUT EVEN AS HE LAID HOLD OF IT LANYARD DROPPED THE GARMENT IN SHEER SURPRISE TO FIND IT DAMP AND HEAVY IN HIS GRASP SODDEN WITH VISCID MOISTURE
THIS LAST DISPOSED OF LANYARD SURRENDERED HIMSELF TO NEW IMPRESSIONS OF WHICH THE FIRST PROVED A BIT DISHEARTENING HOWEVER IMPULSIVELY HE HADN'T RESOUGHT TROYON'S WITHOUT DEFINITE INTENT TO WIT TO GAIN SOME CLUE HOWEVER SLENDER TO THE MYSTERY OF THAT WRETCHED CHILD MARCEL
THE FIRST FLASH OF HIS HAND LAMP DISCOVERED TO HIM SICKENING VERIFICATION OF HIS MOST DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS NOW HE SAW WHY HIS DRESSING GOWN HAD BEEN REQUISITIONED TO PROTECT A BUTCHER'S CLOTHING AFTER A MOMENT HE RETURNED SHUT THE DOOR
TURN ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF LANYARD'S POCKET FLASH LAMP OFFERING ITSELF IMMEDIATELY ITS WIDE CIRCLE OF LIGHT ENVELOPED HIS LATE ANTAGONIST THAT ONE WAS RESTING ON A SHOULDER LEGS UNCOUTHLY A SPRAWL
AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE CITY BY ANY ORDINARY CHANNEL WOULD BE TO INVITE EITHER DENUNCIATION TO THE POLICE ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER OR ONE OF THOSE FATALLY EXPEDITIOUS FORMS OF ASSASSINATION OF WHICH THE APACHES ARE PAST MASTERS HE MUST AND WOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY
IT WAS NATURALLY NO SURPRISE TO FIND HIS BED CHAMBER DOOR UNLOCKED AND SLIGHTLY AJAR LANYARD MADE SURE OF THE READINESS OF HIS AUTOMATIC STRODE INTO THE ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR QUIETLY BUT BY NO MEANS SOUNDLESSLY
BUT THAT THE FRENCHMAN WAS WELL AWARE OF THAT INTEREST AND HE RESENTED SINCERELY HIS INABILITY TO FEEL AS CONFIDENT THAT THE COUNT WITH HIS GOSSIP ABOUT THE LONE WOLF HAD BEEN MERELY SEEKING TO DIVERT RODDY'S INTEREST TO PUTATIVELY LARGER GAME
HIS DINNER COMPRISED A CUT FROM THE JOINT BOILED POTATOES BRUSSELS SPROUTS A BIT OF CHEESE A BOTTLE OF BASS HE ATE SLOWLY CHEWING WITH THE DOGGEDNESS OF A STRONG CHARACTER HAMPERED BY A WEAK DIGESTION
I TELL HIM HE SHOULD NOT STOP IN PARIS AT THIS SEASON IT IS NOTHING THE AMERICAN INTERPOSED BRUSQUELY BETWEEN PAROXYSMS BUT OUR WINTER CLIMATE MONSIEUR IT IS NOT FIT FOR THOSE IN THE PRIME OF HEALTH IT IS I WHO AM UNFIT BANNON SNAPPED PRESSING A HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS LIPS UNFIT TO LIVE
HIS DOUBTS ALTOGETHER DISSIPATED BY THIS INCIDENT LANYARD FOLLOWED HIS NATURAL ENEMY INTO THE DINING ROOM WITH AN AIR AS DEVIL MAY CARE AS ONE COULD WISH AND SO IMPRESSIVE THAT THE MAITRE D'HOTEL ABANDONED THE DETECTIVE TO THE MERCIES OF ONE OF HIS CAPTAINS AND HIMSELF HASTENED TO SEAT LANYARD AND TAKE HIS ORDER
BUT HE OPERATES IN A MOST INDIVIDUAL WAY AND KEEPS THE POLICE BUSY TRYING TO GUESS WHERE HE'LL STRIKE NEXT THE GIRL BREATHED AN INCREDULOUS EXCLAMATION
HIS EXTRAORDINARY POPULARITY WAS DUE TO THE EQUALLY EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAVAGANCE WITH WHICH HE SUPPORTED THAT LATEST GALLIC FAD LE SPORT THE PARISIAN RUGBY TEAM WAS HIS PAMPERED PROTEGE HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE TENNIS CLUB MAINTAINED NOT ONLY A FLOCK OF AUTOMOBILES BUT A FAMOUS RACING STABLE
BUT THE ADVENTURER WAS SATISFIED THAT IN HIS PROPER GUISE AS HIMSELF HE NEEDED ONLY TO OPEN THAT POSTERN DOOR AT THE STREET END OF THE PASSAGE TO FEEL A KNIFE SLIP IN BETWEEN HIS RIBS
AND HE WONDERED WITH A THRILL OF AMUSEMENT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT RODDY WAS ON THE TRAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BUCK IF SO IT WOULD BE A CHASE WORTH FOLLOWING A DIVERSION RENDERED THE MORE EXQUISITE TO LANYARD BY THE SPICE OF NOVELTY SINCE FOR ONCE HE WOULD FIGURE AS A DISPASSIONATE BYSTANDER
WHICH HAD MEASURABLY PROTECTED THE KILLER'S HANDS AND WHICH LANYARD HAD FOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM STRIPPED HASTILY OFF AND THROWN TO THE FLOOR TWIN CRUMPLED WADS OF BLOOD STAINED CHAMOIS SKIN
BUT THE AMERICAN PERSISTED PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US HOW THEY GOT ON HIS TRACK IT WASN'T DIFFICULT SAID DE MORBIHAN INDEED QUITE SIMPLE THIS TONE OF DEPRECIATION IS BECOMING FOR IT WAS MY PART TO SUGGEST THE SOLUTION TO MY FRIEND THE CHIEF OF THE SURETE
WITH THE MOST COLD BLOODED INTENT GIVEN ONE OF THREE TARGETS WHILE POPINOT'S CREATURES IF THEY WORRIED HIM HE MEANT TO EXTERMINATE WITH AS LITTLE COMPUNCTION
KNELT AND LIFTING THE BODY TURNED IT UPON ITS BACK
THROUGH THIS PERFUNCTORY DECEASE THE LONE WOLF WOULD GAIN A FREEDOM EVEN GREATER THAN BEFORE THE PACK HAD CONTRIVED ONLY TO ELIMINATE MICHAEL LANYARD THE AMATEUR OF FINE PAINTINGS REMAINED THE LONE WOLF WITH NOT ONE FACULTY IMPAIRED
WITH A LOW CRY SMITTEN WITH AWFUL UNDERSTANDING LANYARD WHEELED AND STARED FEARFULLY AT THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH RODDY'S ROOM IT STOOD AJAR AN INCH OR TWO
OTHER IMPRESSIONS LESS ULTIMATE PROVED PUZZLING DISCONCERTING AND PARADOXICALLY REASSURING LANYARD COMMANDED A FAIR VIEW OF RODDY ACROSS THE WAIST OF THE ROOM THE DETECTIVE HAD ORDERED A MEAL THAT MATCHED HIS ASPECT WELL BOTH OF TRUE BRITISH SIMPLICITY
FOUR SLENDER LITTLE TAPERS WHICH THE SISTERS HAD CONTRIVED TO FASTEN TO THE ALTAR WITH SEALING WAX THREW A PALE GLIMMER DIMLY REFLECTED BY THE YELLOW WALL THESE FEEBLE RAYS SCARCELY LIT UP THE REST OF THE CHAMBER
IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THE SPECIES OF IMBECILITY WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE REVOLUTION ENACTED BEFORE THEIR EYES HAD PRODUCED IN THESE INNOCENT SOULS QUITE INCAPABLE OF HARMONIZING THEIR CONVENTUAL IDEAS WITH THE EXIGENCIES OF ORDINARY LIFE
FORMERLY PERFUMERS TO THE COURT
HE WILL BE SO PLEASED TO SEE MY LITTLE ONES I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE TO MORROW FOR I HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO TO ASK HIM ABOUT MYSELF OF SOME CONSEQUENCE AND MY DEAR WHENEVER HE COMES YOU HAD BETTER LET HIM LOOK AT LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT OH MY DEAR SIR
THE PRIEST SLID WITH DIFFICULTY INTO A NARROW HIDING PLACE AND THE NUNS HASTILY THREW ARTICLES OF APPAREL OVER HIM YOU CAN SHUT ME IN SISTER AGATHA HE SAID IN A SMOTHERED VOICE
YOU SAID YOU SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT CATHERINE READILY AGREED
HE CAST A LAST LOOK UPON THE SIGNS OF THEIR POVERTY AND DISAPPEARED TO THE TWO SIMPLE MINDED WOMEN THIS EVENT HAD ALL THE INTEREST OF A ROMANCE AS SOON AS THE VENERABLE ABBE TOLD THEM OF THE MYSTERIOUS GIFT SO SOLEMNLY OFFERED BY THE STRANGER
OUR PART OF LONDON IS SO VERY SUPERIOR TO MOST OTHERS YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND US WITH LONDON IN GENERAL MY DEAR SIR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALMOST ALL THE REST WE ARE SO VERY AIRY
THAT SWEET AMIABLE JANE FAIRFAX SAID MISSUS JOHN KNIGHTLEY IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE SEEN HER EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR A MOMENT ACCIDENTALLY IN TOWN WHAT HAPPINESS IT MUST BE TO HER GOOD OLD GRANDMOTHER AND EXCELLENT AUNT WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT THEM
HAVE A HEAVY ACCOUNT TO RENDER TO THE KING OF KINGS OH YES ADDED THE VENERABLE MAN MOVING HIS HEAD FROM RIGHT TO LEFT WITH AN EXPRESSIVE MOTION YES HEAVY INDEED FOR STANDING IDLE THEY MADE THEMSELVES THE ACCOMPLICES OF A HORRIBLE TRANSGRESSION
WHAT DO YOU ASK AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOLDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE
MISTER WOODHOUSE AGREED TO IT ALL BUT ADDED OUR LITTLE FRIEND HARRIET SMITH HOWEVER IS JUST SUCH ANOTHER PRETTY KIND OF YOUNG PERSON YOU WILL LIKE HARRIET EMMA COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER COMPANION THAN HARRIET
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENTS BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INQUIRY AFTER THEM
WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT
HER EYES WERE FIXED ON THE GLASS OF THE SHOP WINDOW AS IF SOME ALARMING OBJECT WERE PAINTED UPON IT WHAT IS THE MATTER CITOYENNE ASKED THE MASTER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT RE ENTERING
BETWEEN TWO FLUES OF THE CHIMNEY
WHO NOW FANCIED THAT SHE SAW SOMETHING SINISTER IN THE FEATURES OF THIS UNKNOWN MAN ALL HER TERRORS REVIVED AND PROFITING BY THE CURIOUS HESITATION THAT HAD SEIZED HIM SHE GLIDED LIKE A SHADOW TO THE DOORWAY OF THE SOLITARY DWELLING TOUCHED A SPRING
ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS THIS EVIL HAD BEEN FELT AND LAMENTED AT LEAST THREE TIMES A DAY BY ISABELLA SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN BATH AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE
IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
BUT ONLY JANE FAIRFAX ONE KNOWS TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AND SUPERIOR AND EXACTLY EMMA'S AGE THIS TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED VERY HAPPILY AND OTHERS SUCCEEDED OF SIMILAR MOMENT AND PASSED AWAY WITH SIMILAR HARMONY
MISTER WINGFIELD MOST STRENUOUSLY RECOMMENDED IT SIR OR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE HE RECOMMENDED IT FOR ALL THE CHILDREN BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THE WEAKNESS IN LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT BOTH SEA AIR AND BATHING
THE SOLDIER ORDERED TO FORM THE LINE DO YOU THINK HE WAS GUILTY THE PRIEST HESITATED
SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY THAT WILL BE FORTY MILES A DAY FORTY AY FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE
THAT THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
SOUTH END IS AN UNHEALTHY PLACE PERRY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU HAD FIXED UPON SOUTH END I KNOW THERE IS SUCH AN IDEA WITH MANY PEOPLE BUT INDEED IT IS QUITE A MISTAKE SIR WE ALL HAD OUR HEALTH PERFECTLY WELL THERE NEVER FOUND THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE FROM THE MUD
AND FORGIVE THE REGICIDES
BUT BELIEVE ME I AM HEARTILY DEVOTED TO YOU AND IF THERE IS ANY SERVICE THAT I COULD RENDER YOU YOU MAY EMPLOY ME WITHOUT FEAR
AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND
LIKE THAT OF A PERSON VOWED TO SECRET AUSTERITIES IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SOME RECENT ALARM HAD SPREAD AN UNUSUAL PALENESS OVER HER FEATURES
ALTHOUGH THE PASTRY COOK COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE ENORMOUS BLACK SILK HOOD CIRCLED WITH PURPLE RIBBONS WHICH THE STRANGER WORE HE DISAPPEARED WITH A GLANCE AT HIS WIFE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY DO YOU SUPPOSE I SHOULD LEAVE THAT ON YOUR COUNTER
HE WAS SCARCELY HIDDEN WHEN THREE KNOCKS UPON THE DOOR MADE THE SISTERS TREMBLE AND CONSULT EACH OTHER WITH THEIR EYES FOR THEY DARED NOT SPEAK FORTY YEARS SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD HAD MADE THEM LIKE PLANTS OF A HOT HOUSE WHICH WILT WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE OUTER AIR
WHY DOES HE MAKE IT ANY BUSINESS OF HIS TO WONDER AT WHAT I DO AT MY TAKING MY FAMILY TO ONE PART OF THE COAST OR ANOTHER I MAY BE ALLOWED I HOPE THE USE OF MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MISTER PERRY I WANT HIS DIRECTIONS NO MORE THAN HIS DRUGS HE PAUSED
AND GROWING COOLER IN A MOMENT ADDED WITH ONLY SARCASTIC DRYNESS IF MISTER PERRY CAN TELL ME HOW TO CONVEY A WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES WITH NO GREATER EXPENSE OR INCONVENIENCE THAN A DISTANCE OF FORTY
WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE HAD SHE BEEN MORE EXPERT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN
COME SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING AND AFFECTIONATE VOICE COME YOU ARE EXPECTED THE MAN RAISED HIS HEAD GAVE THE NUN A GLOOMY LOOK AND MADE NO ANSWER SHE FELT AS THOUGH AN ICY GARMENT HAD FALLEN UPON HER AND SHE KEPT SILENCE
THE SHOPKEEPER AND HIS WIFE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A GLANCE AT THE OLD LADY THAT CONVEYED A MUTUAL THOUGHT THE LOUIS WAS DOUBTLESS HER LAST THE HANDS OF THE POOR WOMAN TREMBLED AS SHE OFFERED IT AND HER EYES RESTED UPON IT SADLY YET NOT WITH AVARICE
THE STRANGER HASTENED TO ACCEPT THE HESITATION OF THE PRIEST AS A SOLUTION OF THE DOUBTS THAT SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM THEN SO AS NOT TO ALLOW THE OLD JANSENIST TIME FOR FURTHER REFLECTION HE SAID QUICKLY
WELL HUNG TOWN BUILT I HAVE NOT HAD IT A MONTH IT WAS BUILT FOR A CHRIST CHURCH MAN A FRIEND OF MINE A VERY GOOD SORT OF FELLOW HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
SAID THE TWO NUNS SOFTLY BUT IN A TONE OF DESPAIR MY PLACE IS NEAR THE VICTIMS SAID THE PRIEST SIMPLY THE NUNS WERE SILENT LOOKING AT HIM WITH DEVOUT ADMIRATION SISTER MARTHA HE SAID ADDRESSING THE NUN WHO HAD FETCHED THE WAFERS
SNOW HAD FALLEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO THAT FOOTFALLS COULD BE SCARCELY HEARD THE STREETS WERE DESERTED
THE TWO NUNS SAW THE TEARS COURSING DOWN THE MANLY CHEEKS OF THEIR VISITANT AND DROPPING FAST ON THE TILED FLOOR THE OFFICE OF THE DEAD WAS RECITED THE DOMINE SALVUM FAC REGEM SUNG IN LOW TONES
AH SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE SHAKING HIS HEAD AND FIXING HIS EYES ON HER WITH TENDER CONCERN THE EJACULATION IN EMMA'S EAR EXPRESSED
THEY ALWAYS BEHAVE VERY WELL TO ME OH THEY GIVE THEMSELVES SUCH AIRS THEY ARE THE MOST CONCEITED CREATURES IN THE WORLD AND THINK THEMSELVES OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE BY THE BY THOUGH I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT A HUNDRED TIMES I HAVE ALWAYS FORGOT TO ASK YOU
SHE HAD NOTHING WORSE TO HEAR THAN ISABELLA'S KIND INQUIRY AFTER JANE FAIRFAX AND JANE FAIRFAX THOUGH NO GREAT FAVORITE WITH HER IN GENERAL SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT VERY HAPPY TO ASSIST IN PRAISING
TWO BUNDLES OF STRAW PLACED ON TWO PLANKS SERVED AS BEDS FOR THE NUNS A TABLE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM UPON IT A COPPER CANDLESTICK A FEW PLATES THREE KNIVES AND A ROUND LOAF OF BREAD
AND THEY ACQUIESCED WITH RESIGNATION BUT THE PRIEST FANCIED HE SAW A SMILE QUICKLY REPRESSED UPON THE STRANGER'S LIP
I HAVE NOT COME AS AN ENEMY CITOYENNES THEN HE PAUSED BUT RESUMED MY SISTERS IF HARM SHOULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BE SURE THAT I SHALL NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT I HAVE COME TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU THEY STILL KEPT SILENCE
AND THE FEELING THAT HELD THESE FOUR SERVANTS OF GOD AND THE KING WAS UNANIMOUS THE SACRED WORDS ECHOED LIKE CELESTIAL MUSIC AMID THE SILENCE THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE UNKNOWN BROKE DOWN AND WEPT IT WAS AT THE PATER NOSTER
I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES THAT'S THE BOOK SUCH UNNATURAL STUFF
SHE REACHED THE SHOP OF A PASTRY COOK ENTERED IT AND FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR WHICH STOOD BEFORE THE COUNTER AS SHE LIFTED THE CREAKING LATCH OF THE DOOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS AT WORK ON A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY
HERE ARE THE SACRAMENTAL WAFERS LISTEN SHE CRIED INTERRUPTING HERSELF I HEAR SOME ONE ON THE STAIRS AT THESE WORDS ALL THREE LISTENED INTENTLY THE NOISE CEASED
WAS THEIR SECRET PROTECTOR THEY ADDED TO THEIR DAILY PRAYERS A SPECIAL PRAYER FOR HIM NIGHT AND DAY THESE PIOUS HEARTS MADE SUPPLICATION FOR HIS HAPPINESS HIS PROSPERITY HIS REDEMPTION
FIXED UPON THE OLD MAN SHOWED PLAINLY THAT HE ALONE WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR EXTREME ANXIETY WHY DISTRUST GOD MY SISTERS HE SAID IN A HOLLOW BUT IMPRESSIVE VOICE
RESPECTFULLY SALUTING THE PRIEST AND THE TWO SAINTLY WOMEN
NOT EVEN COMPREHENDING THEIR OWN SITUATION THEY WERE LIKE CHILDREN WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN CARED FOR AND WHO NOW TORN FROM THEIR MATERNAL PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN TO PRAYERS AS OTHER CHILDREN TAKE TO TEARS
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COMPLEXION IN A MAN DO YOU LIKE THEM BEST DARK OR FAIR I HARDLY KNOW I NEVER MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT IT SOMETHING BETWEEN BOTH I THINK BROWN NOT FAIR AND NOT VERY DARK
THE TRUTH IS THAT IN LONDON IT IS ALWAYS A SICKLY SEASON NOBODY IS HEALTHY IN LONDON NOBODY CAN BE IT IS A DREADFUL THING TO HAVE YOU FORCED TO LIVE THERE SO FAR OFF AND THE AIR SO BAD NO INDEED WE ARE NOT AT ALL IN A BAD AIR
POOR BUT NOBLE PROFANE AND HOLY IN ONE THE UNKNOWN MAN KNELT PIOUSLY BETWEEN THE SISTERS SUDDENLY AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE CRAPE UPON THE CHALICE AND THE CRUCIFIX
THE THREE PRISONERS SOON PERCEIVED THAT IN SPITE OF THE TERROR A POWERFUL ARM WAS STRETCHED OVER THEM FIRST THEY RECEIVED FIREWOOD AND PROVISIONS NEXT THE SISTERS GUESSED THAT A WOMAN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PROTECTOR
THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
I SHOULD BE UNWILLING I OWN TO LIVE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE TOWN THERE IS HARDLY ANY OTHER THAT I COULD BE SATISFIED TO HAVE MY CHILDREN IN BUT WE ARE SO REMARKABLY AIRY
UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MISFORTUNE OR THE YOKE OF PERSECUTION A MAN OF COURAGE BEGINS AS IT WERE BY PREPARING FOR THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF HE LOOKS UPON HIS DAYS AS SO MANY VICTORIES WON FROM FATE THE EYES OF THE TWO WOMEN
BENEATH THESE RAFTERS AND DISJOINTED LATHS FOUR CHRISTIAN SOULS WERE INTERCEDING WITH GOD FOR A KING OF FRANCE AND MAKING HIS BURIAL WITHOUT A COFFIN IT WAS THE PUREST OF ALL DEVOTIONS
YIELDING TO AN IMPULSE SAW STANDING ERECT IN THE CART THE STRANGER WHO THREE DAYS BEFORE HAD ASSISTED FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THE MASS OF COMMEMORATION WHO IS THAT HE ASKED THE ONE STANDING
WHO ESCAPED MIRACULOUSLY FROM THE MASSACRE AT THE CONVENT OF THE CARMELITES HOSANNA SAID SISTER AGATHA SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING THE STRANGER AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH ANXIOUS CURIOSITY THAT IS NOT HIS NAME I THINK HE ANSWERED
TO WHICH THE PRIEST ADDED A LATIN CLAUSE WHICH THE STRANGER DOUBTLESS COMPREHENDED AND APPLIED
TOWARDS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AN OLD GENTLEWOMAN CAME DOWN THE SHARP DECLIVITY OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT MARTIN
IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH HERE IS MORLAND AND I COME TO STAY A FEW DAYS WITH YOU SO YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR A COUPLE OF GOOD BEDS SOMEWHERE NEAR AND THIS ADDRESS SEEMED TO SATISFY ALL THE FONDEST WISHES OF THE MOTHER'S HEART
THE ACTION AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN NOT ONLY IMPLIED A WISH TO GET RID OF THE STRANGER AS OF SOME ONE MOST UNWELCOME BUT SHE LET FALL AN EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE AT FINDING THE DRAWER EMPTY THEN WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE LADY
ADVICE AS TO THE NECESSARY MEANS OF INSURING THE SAFETY OF THE VENERABLE PRIEST OFTEN CAME TO THEM FROM UNEXPECTED QUARTERS AND PROVED SO SINGULARLY OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY SOME ONE IN POSSESSION OF STATE SECRETS
PERRY WAS A WEEK AT CROMER ONCE AND HE HOLDS IT TO BE THE BEST OF ALL THE SEA BATHING PLACES
THAN PREFERRING TO ENCOUNTER DANGER WITH NO PROTECTION BUT THAT OF GOD RATHER THAN LOSE THE THING SHE HAD COME TO BUY SHE RECOVERED THE AGILITY OF YOUTH AND SPRANG TO THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH SHE DISAPPEARED ABRUPTLY LEAVING THE HUSBAND AND WIFE AMAZED AND TREMBLING
SO SAYING THE PASTRY COOK ENDEAVORED TO GET BACK THE LITTLE BOX WHICH THE OLD LADY HAD ALREADY SLIPPED INTO ONE OF HER POCKETS HARDLY HAD THE BOLD HANDS OF THE SHOPKEEPER TOUCHED HER CLOTHING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE APPEARANCE OF THE STRANGER WERE A CEASELESS TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND OF ENDLESS CONJECTURE AND SOON BECAME A BENEFIT OF A SPECIAL KIND FROM THE OCCUPATION AND DISTRACTION OF MIND WHICH WAS THUS PRODUCED
YOURSELF SHE CRIED THOUGH WE GO OUT SO SELDOM OUR ERRANDS ARE KNOWN OUR STEPS ARE WATCHED WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED ANOTHER OLD WOMAN SITTING NEAR THE FIRE THE MAN WHO HAS HUNG ABOUT THE HOUSE SINCE YESTERDAY FOLLOWED ME TO NIGHT
THE STRANGE SILENCE IN WHICH THEY ALL THREE STOOD AND FACED EACH OTHER LASTED BUT A MOMENT FOR THE STRANGER SEEMED TO GUESS THE MORAL WEAKNESS AND INEXPERIENCE OF THE POOR HELPLESS CREATURES AND HE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH HE STROVE TO RENDER GENTLE
EXCLAIMED THE OTHER NUN HASTILY OPENING A HIDING PLACE BURROWED AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF THIS TIME IT WAS EASY TO HEAR THE STEPS OF A MAN SOUNDING THROUGH THE DEEP SILENCE ON THE ROUGH STAIRS WHICH WERE CAKED WITH PATCHES OF HARDENED MUD
AND HE STOPPED SHORT FOR THE EXTREME DISTRESS PAINTED ON THE FACES OF THE POOR NUNS MADE HIM FEAR HE HAD GONE TOO FAR THEY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AND THEIR EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
RETURN HERE AT MIDNIGHT AND I SHALL BE READY TO CELEBRATE THE ONLY FUNERAL SERVICE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER IN EXPIATION OF THE CRIME OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THE UNKNOWN SHIVERED A JOY BOTH SWEET AND SOLEMN SEEMED TO RISE IN HIS SOUL ABOVE SOME SECRET GRIEF
STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE GROUP BEFORE HIM THEN HE ADDRESSED THE PRIEST IN A TRUSTFUL TONE WITH THESE WORDS MY FATHER I CAME TO ASK YOU TO CELEBRATE A MASS FOR THE REPOSE OF THE SOUL OF
TOUCHED THE HEARTS OF THESE FAITHFUL ROYALISTS AS THEY THOUGHT OF THE INFANT KING NOW CAPTIVE IN THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES FOR WHOM THIS PRAYER WAS OFFERED THE UNKNOWN SHUDDERED
AND SAID IN THE TONE OF A FATHER
BUT NOT SO HEAVY AS HE HAS VERY OFTEN KNOWN THEM IN NOVEMBER PERRY DOES NOT CALL IT ALTOGETHER A SICKLY SEASON NO I DO NOT KNOW THAT MISTER WINGFIELD CONSIDERS IT VERY SICKLY EXCEPT AH MY POOR DEAR CHILD
OF A SACRED BEING WHOSE BODY CAN NEVER LIE IN HOLY GROUND THE PRIEST INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED THE NUNS NOT AS YET UNDERSTANDING WHO IT WAS OF WHOM THE UNKNOWN MAN HAD SPOKEN
SO IT HAPPENED THAT IN PRESENCE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER THEY WERE DUMB AND PASSIVE AND COULD THINK OF NO OTHER DEFENCE THAN CHRISTIAN RESIGNATION THE MAN WHO SOUGHT TO ENTER INTERPRETED THEIR SILENCE AS HE PLEASED HE SUDDENLY OPENED THE DOOR AND SHOWED HIMSELF
AH WE SAW ENOUGH OF THAT LAST YEAR BUT NOW FOUR DAYS AFTER THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF JANUARY WE CAN LOOK AT THE HORRID PROCESSION WITHOUT DISTRESS WHY SO ASKED THE ABBE WHAT YOU SAY IS NOT CHRISTIAN
WHISTLED AMONG THE HOUSES OR RATHER COTTAGES SCATTERED THROUGH THE SPARSELY INHABITED LITTLE VALLEY
GLAD OF THE DILEMMA THAT PLACED THIS PURITAN OF ROYALTY BETWEEN THE DOGMA OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PARTISANS OF MONARCHY SHOULD DOMINATE THE MILITARY SYSTEM AND THE OTHER DOGMA EQUALLY IMPERATIVE WHICH CONSECRATES THE PERSON OF THE KING
AND TO THE EYES OF THESE CHRISTIANS SO TRUE IS IT THAT BETWEEN MAN AND GOD ALL MEDIATION IS UNNEEDED FOR HIS GLORY DESCENDS FROM HIMSELF ALONE THE FERVENT PIETY OF THE NAMELESS MAN WAS UNFEIGNED
HE WENT TO PUT ON HIS UNIFORM AS A NATIONAL GUARD TOOK HIS HAT SLUNG ON HIS SABRE AND REAPPEARED UNDER ARMS BUT THE WIFE MEANTIME HAD REFLECTED REFLECTION AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN MANY HEARTS HAD CLOSED THE OPEN HAND OF HER BENEVOLENCE
AN EPISODE UNDER THE TERROR
I MEAN WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE RETURNED PETER OF COURSE I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THE SMILING POOL BUT WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE
SEEMED LIKE HE WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF HE COULDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE IT WAS ALL BECAUSE HE WAS SO DREADFULLY CURIOUS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS JUST AS PETER RABBIT IS NOW IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS JUST BORN TO BE CURIOUS AND SO OF COURSE TO GET INTO TROUBLE
GRANDFATHER FROG WINKED AT JERRY MUSKRAT WHO WAS LISTENING AND JERRY NODDED HIS HEAD
HE HAD SEEN THE HOUSES OF MOST OF HIS OTHER FRIENDS BUT THINK AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD
IT WAS GREAT FUN THEY RACED AND DODGED AND TWISTED AND TURNED SOMETIMES PETER WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE WOULD FORGET AND USE ALL FOUR LEGS THEN JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD SHOUT NO FAIR
BUT MISTER GREENSNAKE NEVER WINKED BACK INSTEAD HE WOULD RAISE HIS HEAD RUN HIS TONGUE OUT AT PETER AND HISS IN WHAT HE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY FIERCE AND ANGRY MANNER THEN PETER WOULD LAUGH
PETER WOULD SAY THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO AND TO MAKE UP FOR IT WOULD BE IT AND TRY TO CATCH JOHNNY NOW IT HAPPENED THAT CURLED UP ON A LITTLE GRASSY TUSSOCK
WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH AGAIN HE STILL KEPT HIS EYES CLOSED
SAID MISTER FISHER TALKING OUT LOUD TO HIMSELF THAT I'LL HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE SMILING POOL AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH THAT SLOW MOVING TURTLE WHO LIVES THERE I BELIEVE HE'LL MAKE ME A GOOD DINNER OF COURSE MISTER TURTLE HEARD JUST WHAT HE SAID
REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE SO EVER SINCE THAT LONG AGO DAY WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG ALL TURTLES HAVE CARRIED THEIR HOUSES WITH THEM AND NEVER HAVE MEDDLED IN THINGS THAT DON'T CONCERN THEM CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
AND EVEN HAD ASKED UNC BILLY ABOUT IT UNC BILLY HAD JUST GRINNED AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS MAMMY OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND UNC BILLY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE MISTER MUSKRAT HESITATED I
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND BECAUSE HE IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE JUST THEN UP CAME PETER RABBIT ALL OUT OF BREATH HAS GRANDFATHER FROG BEEN TELLING A STORY HE PANTED
WHY HOW STUPID OF ME HE DOESN'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY AT ALL ALL HE HAS GOT TO DO IS TO GO INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE DANGER IS PAST I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE WHY THAT IS THE HANDIEST THING I EVER HEARD OF
BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE USE FOR THEM HIS EYES GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND WHEN HE DID COME UP INTO THE LIGHT THEY HURT HIM SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK INTO THE DARK AGAIN HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE
OF COURSE IT IS VERY HANDY TO HAVE HIS HOUSE ALWAYS WITH HIM AS HE SAYS HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME STILL WHEN HE IS IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM AN ENEMY IT MUST BE VERY AWKWARD TO HAVE TO CARRY HIS HOUSE ON HIS BACK I I
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO HAVE A SNUG HOUSE UNDER THE GROUND WHERE ONE CAN SLEEP THE LONG COLD WINTER AWAY AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE
AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BUT PRETTY SOON MISTER FOX DELICATELY HINTED THAT THEY HAD COME IN RESPONSE TO THE INVITATION SENT BY MISTER POSSUM
HE MADE MY MOUTH WATER THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM SEEMS TO ME I CAN SMELL HIM NOW IF HE HAD MADE THIS HOLE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER I WOULD GO DOWN AND PULL HIM OUT BUT I AM TOO TIRED TO DO ANY DIGGING NOW
NOW WHEN OLD MISTER RABBIT HEARD THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS COMING HIS HEART SANK WAY WAY DOWN FOR HE KNEW JUST HOW ANGRY SHE WOULD BE WHEN SHE SAW HIS HOUSE HIS GARDEN AND HIS SHABBY SUIT
UNC BILLY SAYS IT IS A LOT EASIER THAN RUNNING AWAY AND SAFER TOO
HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE TROUBLE SHE LET HIM FINISH THEN CALLED ALL THE OTHERS ABOUT HER AND TOLD THEM WHO HAD MADE ALL THE TROUBLE
EATEN ME IF I HADN'T CRAWLED INTO AN OLD HOLLOW STUMP NOW I CAN'T RUN FAST BECAUSE MY LEGS ARE TOO SHORT I CAN'T CLIMB TREES LIKE MISTER SQUIRREL AND I CAN'T SWIM LIKE MISTER MUSKRAT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DIG
INTERRUPTED PETER GRANDFATHER FROG SCOWLED AT PETER IF I HAVE ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS THERE WILL BE NO STORY TO DAY SAID HE SEVERELY PETER LOOKED ASHAMED
BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO BE DOING IT AND MISTER SKUNK TOLD HIM SO IF YOU WANT THE REST OF US TO HELP YOU YOU'D BETTER GET THINGS STARTED YOURSELF SAID OLD MISTER SKUNK CAREFULLY COMBING OUT HIS BIG PLUMY TAIL THAT'S RIGHT MISTER SKUNK THAT'S RIGHT SAID MISTER RABBIT
THEY ALSO STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND FOR ONCE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY CHUG A RUM SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
IT WAS MISTER FISHER AND HE WAS VERY HUNGRY AND FIERCE HE LOOKED AT THE PIECE OF BARK UNDER WHICH MISTER TURTLE WAS HIDING BUT ALL HE SAW WAS THE BARK BECAUSE YOU KNOW MISTER TURTLE HAD DRAWN HIMSELF WHOLLY UNDER I BELIEVE
WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM SPOTTY THE TURTLE SAT ON AN OLD LOG ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL TAKING A SUN BATH HE HAD SAT THAT WAY FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITHOUT ONCE MOVING
AND HE HAD DONE SO MUCH OF IT THAT HIS FRONT LEGS AND CLAWS HAD GROWN VERY STOUT NOW IF I DIG A HOLE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISTER WOLF OR ANYBODY ELSE CONTINUED MISTER MOLE TO HIMSELF
WHY NOT ASKED HAPPY JACK ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE KNOWS REPLIED OLD MISTER TOAD AND STARTED ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS THAT GRANDFATHER FROG TOLD THIS STORY TO THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN AWAY WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED BY HIS ENEMIES THEY ALWAYS TRIED TO RUN AWAY SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE EXCEPTING UNC BILLY POSSUM THERE MUST BE A REASON SAID PETER GRAVELY
NO SIR PETER RABBIT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND HE PRETENDED THAT ONE OF HIS LONG HIND LEGS WAS LAME SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN ON THREE LEGS WHILE JOHNNY CHUCK COULD USE ALL FOUR
THERE'S TIME FOR WORK AND TIME FOR PLAY WHO FOLDS HIS ARMS WITH WORK UNDONE DOTH CHEAT HIMSELF AND SPOIL HIS FUN HEREAFTER MISTER RABBIT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO SIT WITH FOLDED ARMS
GOODY CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY CHUCK TOGETHER SITTING DOWN SIDE BY SIDE ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE BANK GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDED HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT AND HALF CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF LOOKING WAY
THEN SOME OF THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME ON THE LAND AS THERE GOT TO BE MORE AND MORE LAND MORE AND MORE OF THE ANIMALS LEFT THE WATER
WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAT STARING AT A LITTLE RIDGE WHERE THE GRASS WAS RAISED UP HE HAD OFTEN SEEN LITTLE RIDGES LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT THEM HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MADE BY MINER THE MOLE
OBEYING THE ORDERS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM WHEN SHE HAD VISITED THEM LAST MY MY MY SUCH A HURRYING AND SCURRYING AND WORRYING AS THERE WAS YOU SEE EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED YES SIR EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST
WHO LEARNED TO WALK AND RUN ON DRY LAND BUT WHO STILL LOVED THE WATER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG ONE DAY OLD MOTHER NATURE FOUND MISTER MUSKRAT SITTING ON A ROCK LOOKING VERY MOURNFUL WHAT'S THE MATTER MISTER MUSKRAT
THAT SEEMS FUNNY TO ME I SUPPOSE THERE IS A REASON FOR IT AND PROBABLY THERE IS A REASON FOR BUILDING HIS HOUSE WHERE IT IS I'VE FOUND THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR MOST THINGS PROBABLY JERRY'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER BUILT HIS HOUSE THAT WAY AND SO JERRY DOES THE SAME THING
HIS HOUSE WAS WITH HIM AND NOW HE HAD SIMPLY RETIRED INSIDE HE DIDN'T NEED ANY OTHER HOUSE THAN JUST THAT HARD SPOTTED SHELL INSIDE OF WHICH HE WAS NOW SO COSILY TUCKED AWAY THAT'S A GREAT IDEA HO HO HO
TOO SMART THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE YES SIR THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MISTER SNAKE HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS THE SMARTEST OF ALL THE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND THAT WAS A BAD THING
THERE WAS THE GREATEST CHANGING OF CLOTHES YOU EVER DID SEE OLD KING BEAR PUT ON HIS BLACKEST COAT MISTER COON AND MISTER MINK AND MISTER OTTER SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT BRUSHING THEIR SUITS AND MAKING THEM LOOK AS FINE AND HANDSOME AS THEY COULD
MISTER SNAKE HAD FORGOTTEN ONE THING ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING IT WAS THIS YOU CAN'T FOOL OLD MOTHER NATURE AND IT IS OF NO USE TO TRY
AND AND WELL I WAS PUT IN THE WATER IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED WITH WHAT I HAVE GOT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS SO PLEASED WITH MISTER MUSKRAT'S REPLY
AS USUAL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD NO SOONER DID PETER POP HIS HEAD ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL THAN GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED CHUG A RUM YOU'VE KEPT ME WAITING A LONG TIME PETER RABBIT
OH VERY INDIGNANT INDEED SHE DECIDED THAT MISTER RABBIT SHOULD BE PUNISHED VERY SEVERELY BUT AS SHE WATCHED HIM SITTING THERE DREAMING IN THE WARM SUNSHINE HER ANGER BEGAN TO MELT AWAY THE FACT IS
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS JUST THE LEAST LITTLE HINT OF A SMILE IN THE CORNERS OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S BIG MOUTH YOU SIT HERE A MINUTE HE WHISPERED IN JOHNNY CHUCK'S EAR
WAS VERY MUCH AS UNC BILLY IS NOW ONLY HE WAS A LITTLE MORE SPRY AND KNEW BETTER THAN TO STUFF HIMSELF SO FULL THAT HE COULDN'T RUN HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SLY AND HE PLAYED A GREAT MANY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS
IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS HE LOOKED UP AND WINKED AT JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MISTER SUN STRIPED CHIPMUNK JOHNNY CHUCK JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
BUT NO JERRY MUSKRAT PROBABLY HE IS TAKING A NAP IN THAT BIG HOUSE OF HIS SAID JOHNNY CHUCK AND IF HE IS WE'LL HAVE TO SIT HERE UNTIL HE WAKES UP OR ELSE GO BACK HOME AND VISIT HIM SOME OTHER TIME
HE IS VERY FOND OF SITTING WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED THAT WAY A LITTLE WAY FROM HIM SAT PETER RABBIT PETER WAS SITTING UP VERY STRAIGHT BUT HIS HANDS DROPPED RIGHT DOWN IN FRONT HAPPY JACK NOTICED IT WHY DON'T YOU FOLD YOUR HANDS THE WAY I DO PETER RABBIT
HE GRINNED TO HIMSELF AND PRETENDED TO GO TO SLEEP GOOD MORNING GRANDFATHER FROG SAID JOHNNY CHUCK GRANDFATHER FROG DIDN'T ANSWER JOHNNY TRIED AGAIN AND STILL NO REPLY HE'S ASLEEP
JUST AS ALL THE SNAKE FAMILY DO AT YOU AND ME TO DAY WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED TELLING THEM HOW CHEATING AND STEALING AND LYING ISN'T SMART AT ALL BUT VERY VERY DREADFUL
HE WAS TALKING TO DEAR ME DEAR ME SUCH TERRIBLE TIMES AS THERE WERE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IN THE GREEN FOREST THEY GREW WORSE AND WORSE
IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPRINGTIME AND SUMMERTIME AND AUTUMNTIME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND JUST THINK OF ALL THAT MINER MISSES THE SUNSHINE THE FLOWERS THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TO PLAY WITH I WONDER
AND HE WAS VERY VERY COMFORTABLE OLD MISTER RABBIT BEGAN TO NOD AND PRESENTLY HE WAS FAST ASLEEP NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE LIKES TO TAKE PEOPLE BY SURPRISE AND IT HAPPENED THAT SHE CHOSE THIS VERY DAY TO MAKE HER PROMISED VISIT
HE WAS SO SPRY AND SLIM AND COULD SLIP THROUGH THE TALL GRASS SO FAST THAT HE COULD GO ALMOST WHERE HE PLEASED WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THIS MADE HIM VERY BOLD IF HE DID HAPPEN TO BE FOUND NEAR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE
STRIPED CHIPMUNK HADN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO DO SO OFF THEY STARTED ON THE WAY THEY MET JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND AND BECAUSE THEY HADN'T ANYTHING BETTER TO DO
BUT NOW AS HE LOOKED AT THIS ONE IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN MINER THE MOLE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN ALL HIS LIFE WHAT A QUEER WAY OF LIVING THOUGHT STRIPED CHIPMUNK
ONE THING PUZZLED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GREAT DEAL AFTER THEY HAD COME TO KNOW UNC BILLY POSSUM AND HIS FUNNY WAYS THEY HAD TALKED IT OVER AND WONDERED AND WONDERED ABOUT IT AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND IT
THAT GRANDFATHER FROG HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST OF FOOLISH GREEN FLIES TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HIS EYES TWINKLED AS PETER AND JOHNNY VERY POLITELY WISHED HIM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
FOR UNC BILLY'S MAMMY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING UP FROM OL VIRGINNY TO THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS WHERE THEY LIVED HE SAID IT JUST TO TEASE THEM AND WHEN HE SAID IT HE CHUCKLED UNTIL THEY CHUCKLED TOO
GRANDFATHER FROG SNAPPED AT A FOOLISH GREEN FLY AND WHEN IT WAS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS THREE LITTLE VISITORS AND THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES
AND MISTER COON AND MISTER MINK AND MISTER SQUIRREL AND MISTER CHIPMUNK AND ALL THE REST OF HIS NEIGHBORS TELLING THEM OF HIS TROUBLE AND ASKING THEM TO HELP
FOR NO ONE ELSE KNOWS IT OF COURSE PETER AND JOHNNY PROMISED TO SIT PERFECTLY STILL AND NOT SAY A WORD AFTER THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE GRANDFATHER FROG
GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED JUST TO FOOL PEOPLE STUPID SAID HE OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS HOW HE EVER FOUND OUT THAT HE COULD FOOL PEOPLE THAT WAY
AND CAN'T FIND OUT THAT YOU MOST WANT TO FIND OUT IT WAS JUST SO WITH PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK THE MORE THEY TALKED ABOUT IT THE MORE THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHY WAS IT THAT UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYED DEAD
PETER RABBIT HAD SEEN HIM WHEN HE WENT BY ON HIS WAY TO THE LAUGHING BROOK AND THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR SOME ONE TO PASS THE TIME OF DAY WITH SPOTTY WAS STILL THERE WHEN PETER RETURNED A LONG TIME AFTER AND HE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF HE HAD MOVED
HA HA HA GRANDFATHER FROG AFRAID OF A TOADSTOOL HA HA HA AT FIRST GRANDFATHER FROG WAS ANGRY VERY ANGRY INDEED BUT HE IS TOO OLD AND TOO WISE TO LOSE HIS TEMPER FOR LONG OVER A JOKE
AND HE WENT OFF THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST LAUGHING FIT TO KILL HIMSELF PRETTY SOON HE MET MISTER PANTHER HE WAS VERY POLITE TO MISTER PANTHER HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM A CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND HINTED THAT OLD KING BEAR WAS THEN ENJOYING A FEAST
YOU JUST KNOCKED THE LIFE OUT OF HIM WHEN YOU SHOOK HIM OFF THAT BRANCH MISTER PANTHER CAME OVER AND SNIFFED AT MISTER POSSUM AND TURNED HIM OVER WITH ONE PAW ALL THE TIME MISTER POSSUM LAY JUST AS IF HE WERE DEAD
BUT NOW PETER FELT ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM YOU SEE IT SEEMED TO PETER AS IF GRANDFATHER FROG HAD READ HIS VERY THOUGHTS I I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE WAITING TRULY I DIDN'T STAMMERED PETER
I TELL YOU WHAT REPLIED MISTER BADGER WE'LL HUNT TOGETHER A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TO EAT WE'LL COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU DIG I HATE TO HURT MISTER MOLE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS
FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE MISTER MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
NOW IN SPITE OF THE TROUBLE MISTER RABBIT WAS FOREVER MAKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BY HIS DREADFUL CURIOSITY AND MEDDLING WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS ALL HIS NEIGHBORS HAD A WARM PLACE IN THEIR HEARTS FOR MISTER RABBIT AND THEY ALL PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD HELP HIM
AND ALL THE WAY THERE HE WONDERED AND WONDERED HOW GRANDFATHER FROG KNEW THAT HE WANTED THAT STORY AND TO THIS DAY HE HASN'T FOUND OUT YOU SEE HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT GRANDFATHER FROG WAS LISTENING WHEN HE ASKED SPOTTY ABOUT HIS HOUSE
CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE OF COURSE REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH PUT OUT AT SUCH A FOOLISH QUESTION
AND WHEN AT LAST OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG SHE HEARD SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHERE TO BEGIN TO STRAIGHTEN MATTERS OUT SHE HAD ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE COME BEFORE HER IN TURN AND TELL THEIR TROUBLES
I REALLY BELIEVE HE CAN'T FOLD HIS HANDS SAID HAPPY JACK TO HIMSELF BUT SPEAKING ALOUD HE CAN'T AND NONE OF HIS FAMILY CAN SAID A GRUFF VOICE HAPPY JACK TURNED TO FIND OLD MISTER TOAD SITTING IN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
AS HE PULLED THOUGHTFULLY AT ONE OF HIS LONG EARS OF COURSE THERE IS A REASON ASSERTED JOHNNY CHUCK CHEWING THE END OF A BLADE OF GRASS THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING ADDED STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMBING OUT THE HAIR OF HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL
EVERYBODY BUT MISTER RABBIT NOW MISTER RABBIT WAS LAZY HE DIDN'T LIKE TO WORK ANY MORE THAN PETER RABBIT DOES NOW NO SIR OLD MISTER RABBIT WAS AFRAID OF WORK THE VERY SIGHT OF WORK SCARED OLD MISTER RABBIT
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS BEEN FAIRLY CAUGHT TRYING TO PLAY A JOKE HIMSELF SO PRESENTLY HE CLIMBED BACK ON TO HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD BLINKING HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES AND LOOKING JUST A WEE BIT FOOLISH CHUG A RUM
AT FIRST HE WAS ANNOYED AND STARTED TO SHAKE IT OFF BEFORE HE SUCCEEDED HE HEARD SOMEONE COMING
GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT ONCE MORE AND WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES BEGAN ONCE UPON A TIME LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG LIVED OLD MISTER SNAKE
HE WAS VERY OLD SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE SOON AND LEAVE HER AND THEN THERE WOULD BE YEARS AND YEARS PERHAPS BEFORE SHE LAY DOWN IN HER BED AND KNEW THE GREAT MOMENT WAS AT HAND THERE CAME A KNOCK UPON THE DOOR AND A SERVANT TOLD HER THAT COLONEL DURRANCE WAS WAITING
ABOU FATMA AT THE WELLS OF OBAK
I NEVER BLAMED YOU FOR THEM SAID FEVERSHAM WITH A LAUGH
THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT IT I AM GLAD AND THE LADY SIGHED AS THOUGH WITH RELIEF WHAT IS YOUR SECOND ITEM AS GOOD AS THE FIRST I GO OUT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF MISSUS ADAIR WAS SILENT
THE COLLIE THRUST ITS MUZZLE INTO THE BACK OF HIS KNEE SNIFFED ONCE OR TWICE DOUBTFULLY AND SUDDENLY BROKE INTO AN EXUBERANT WELCOME THE COLLIE DOG HAD A BETTER MEMORY THAN THE LANDLADY OF THE INN
AND THE WORDS WERE READY TO HER LIPS AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF HARRY FEVERSHAM RECOVERED TO HER AFTER SO MANY YEARS SO MUCH SUSPENSE SO MUCH SUFFERING IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE NEVER WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK THEM
BUT THE CONVINCING FACTS WERE NOT REVEALED TO ME IN THAT WAY WHEN YOU PLAYED THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE BEFORE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN WILLOUGHBY BROUGHT YOU SUCH GOOD NEWS I TOOK TO MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS OF YOURS WHICH INSPIRED YOUR PLAYING YOU MUST NOT BLAME YOURSELF
DO WITH THEM SHE CRIED IN SCORN I SHALL DO NOTHING WITH THEM I SHALL KEEP THEM I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE THEM TO KEEP SHE KEPT THEM AS SHE HAD ONCE KEPT HARRY FEVERSHAM'S PORTRAIT THERE WAS SOMETHING PERHAPS IN DURRANCE'S CONTENTION
TO HIS FEET BUT AS HE ROSE HE LOOKED AT THE MAN WHO DROVE IT AND SAW THAT WHILE HIS JELLAB WAS DRAWN FORWARD OVER HIS FACE TO PROTECT IT FROM THE SUN HIS BARE LEGS SHOWED
I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD GET YOU TO PLAY IT AGAIN TO NIGHT THE OVERTURE WHICH WAS ONCE STRUMMED OUT IN A DINGY CAFE AT WADI HALFA TO NIGHT AGAIN I SHOULD FIND YOU OFF YOUR GUARD
TO A STEM EXAMINED ITS SHOULDERS IN THE LEFT SHOULDER A TINY INCISION HAD BEEN MADE AND THE SKIN NEATLY STITCHED UP AGAIN WITH FINE THREAD HE CUT THE STITCHES AND PRESSING OPEN THE TWO EDGES OF THE WOUND FORCED OUT A TINY PACKAGE
WAS NOT ONE OF THEM DULL YOU WITH YOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS TO DO CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW OPPRESSIVELY DULL MY LIFE WAS AND THAT WAS NOT ALL
I AM VERY SORRY SAID DURRANCE MISSUS ADAIR WAS QUITE RIGHT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO BE SAID ON HER BEHALF THE WORLD HAD GONE RATHER HARDLY WITH HER
COMPARED WITH THE OTHER OUR FIRST PARTING OVER AT THE HOUSE SIX YEARS AGO I FELT VERY LONELY AFTER THAT AS I SHALL NOT FEEL LONELY NOW THERE WAS A GREAT BARRIER BETWEEN US THEN SEPARATING US FOREVER WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MET AGAIN HERE OR AFTERWARDS
FOR FIVE MORNINGS HE THUS CAME FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND SAT LOOKING TOWARD THE SAND DUNES AND BERBER AND NO ONE APPROACHED HIM BUT ON THE SIXTH AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF RETURNING TO HIS SHELTER HE SAW THE FIGURES OF A MAN AND A DONKEY
IT WAS EFFENDI FEVERSHAM THEN HE SAID AND THE EYES ASSENTED AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE LIPS HAD SPOKEN BUT THIS WAS ALL THE INFORMATION WHICH CALDER COULD SECURE I TOO AM PLEDGED TO HELP
IT WAS NOT THAT SHE HAD AGED SO MUCH HER BIG GREY EYES SHONE AS CLEARLY AS BEFORE
FEVERSHAM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND SIDE BY SIDE THEY WENT RACING DOWN THE SAND
AND A PILE OF STONES NO BIGGER THAN ONE MIGHT SEE BY THE SIDE OF ANY ROADWAY IN REPAIR ACHIEVES THE STATURE OF A CONSIDERABLE HILL IN THIS PARTICULAR MAY THERE COULD BE NO SPOT MORE DESOLATE THAN THE WELLS OF OBAK
I HAVE KNOWN A LONG WHILE EVER SINCE CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME TO THE POOL WITH THE FIRST FEATHER I WAITED TO TELL YOU THAT I KNEW UNTIL HARRY FEVERSHAM CAME BACK AND HE CAME TO DAY
IT WAS NOT RIGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OH A LONG TIME SINCE UNTIL COLONEL TRENCH REMINDED ME I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN THEM WHEN I DID I WAS NOT THINKING THEY WOULD LIVE SO IN YOUR THOUGHTS I AM SORRY THAT I SPOKE THEM OH THEY WERE JUST ENOUGH
THE NEGRO TIED IT SECURELY INTO A CORNER OF HIS WRAP LOOSED HIS WATER SKIN FROM THE DONKEY'S BACK FILLED IT AT THE WELL AND SLUNG IT ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS
WHEN I WENT TO LONDON TO SEE MY OCULIST IT WAS A RELIEF IT GAVE YOU A PAUSE A REST WHEREIN TO DROP PRETENCE AND BE YOURSELF
THAT WOMEN SO MUCH MORE THAN MEN GATHER UP THEIR EXPERIENCES AND LIVE UPON THEM LOOKING BACKWARDS FEVERSHAM AT ALL EVENTS WOULD NOW HAVE DROPPED THE FEATHERS THEN AND THERE AND CRUSHED THEM INTO THE DUST OF THE PATH WITH HIS HEEL THEY HAD DONE THEIR WORK
ONLY THAT NIGHT DURRANCE MADE HER PATH A LITTLE HARDER TO TREAD HE ASKED HER AFTER THE MAID HAD BROUGHT IN THE TEA TO PLAY TO HIM THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE UPON HER VIOLIN NOT TO NIGHT SAID ETHNE I
SHROUDED IN A BLACK VEIL THE ANGAREB AND ITS BURDEN HAD BEEN CARRIED ON BOARD EARLY THAT MORNING AT KOROSKO BY TWO ARABS WHO NOW SAT LAUGHING AND CHATTERING IN THE STERN OF THE BARGE
I HAD A HOUSE IN TOWN AND ANOTHER HERE BUT IT WAS DULL AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS
I GO OUT TO EGYPT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF
IT DOES NOT PREVENT ETHNE FROM SHRINKING FROM HER FRIEND CRIED MISSUS ADAIR SHE SHRINKS FROM YOU SHALL I TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE YOU ARE BLIND SHE IS AFRAID WHILE I I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH
YET THE LIVING CREATURE BENEATH THE VEIL NEVER STIRRED THE VEIL NEVER FLUTTERED ABOVE THE LIPS THE LEGS REMAINED STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT THE ARMS LAY CLOSE AGAINST THE SIDE
AND HE CARED FOR ME BOTH THINGS ARE TRUE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE DID CARE FOR ME WAS THE ONE LINK IF YOU UNDERSTAND AT THE BEGINNING I WAS CONTENTED I SUPPOSE
THOUGH THE COLD SPRAY BROKE CONTINUALLY UPON ITS FACE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO SAID CALDER HE GOT A LANTERN AND WITH THE GERMAN STUDENT CLIMBED ACROSS THE BULWARKS ON TO THE BARGE HE SUMMONED THE TWO ARABS
AND EACH COURT WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BY A DEGREE OF RUIN ALREADY THE FOXES MADE THEIR BURROWS BENEATH THE WALLS HE HAD CALCULATED THAT ONE NIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TERM OF HIS STAY IN BERBER
IN THE NILE VILLAGES IN THE DIM WIDE SPACES OF THE DESERT
HIS BLINDNESS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY TRACE SHE DID NOT APPEAL FOR PITY SHE WAS NOT EVEN EXCUSING HERSELF SHE WAS JUST TELLING HER STORY QUIETLY AND GENTLY
SO IT SEEMED TO HIM NOW WHEN HE KNEW THAT HER FACE WAS STILL TO BE TURNED AWAY FOR ALL HIS DAYS HE HAD DRAWN A THOUGHT FROM HER PLAYING WHICH HE WAS AT SOME PAINS TO KEEP DEFINITE IN HIS MIND THE TRUE MUSIC CANNOT COMPLAIN
I SHOULD THINK I WAS I GO SOON TOO AND THE SOONER THE BETTER I WILL COME AND DINE SOME NIGHT IF I MAY BEFORE I GO MY HUSBAND WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE YOU SAID MISSUS ADAIR RATHER COLDLY DURRANCE DID NOT NOTICE THE COLDNESS HOWEVER
AND FEVERSHAM TOOK HIS STAND BESIDE HER IT WAS VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL WITHIN THAT TINY CHURCH THE AFTERNOON SUN SHONE THROUGH THE UPPER WINDOWS AND MADE A GOLDEN HAZE ABOUT THE ROOF THE NATURAL MURMURS OF THE SUMMER FLOATED PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE CRIED IN A KIND OF DESPAIR AND COMING CLOSE TO HER HE TOOK GENTLY HOLD OF HER ARM BUT SINCE I KNOW HE PROTESTED WHAT DOES IT MATTER HOW I KNOW
I AM GLAD OF THAT SAID FEVERSHAM HE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
DURRANCE MEANWHILE WALKED TO HIS LODGING ALONE REMEMBERING A DAY NOW TWO YEARS SINCE
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO TALK OF HIS TRAVELS OR ADVENTURES THE OCCASION SEEMED TOO SERIOUS TOO VITAL THEY WERE TOGETHER TO DECIDE THE MOST SOLEMN ISSUE IN THEIR LIVES ONCE THE DECISION WAS MADE AS NOW IT HAD BEEN MADE HE FELT THAT THEY COULD HARDLY TALK ON OTHER TOPICS
SHE MEASURED OUT A SPACE UPON THE WALLS WHERE IT STILL GLOWED BRIGHT WHEN ALL THAT SPACE WAS COLD GREY STONE SHE WOULD SEND HARRY FEVERSHAM AWAY I AM GLAD THAT YOU ESCAPED FROM OMDURMAN WITHOUT THE HELP OF LIEUTENANT SUTCH OR COLONEL DURRANCE
THEY WERE NO MORE THAN VISIONARY NOW NOR WAS HE OCCUPIED WITH ANY DREAM OF THE THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT FOR HIS GREAT FAULT THE THINGS WHICH HAD BEEN HERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN OF IRELAND
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER ITS SUCCESSORS WOULD SUSTAIN ITS PROMISE THEY WERE LOOKING BACKWARD THROUGH THE LEAVES BEFORE THEY PUT IT FINALLY AWAY YOU MUST STAY WITH US JACK WHEN YOU COME BACK SAID FEVERSHAM DURRANCE HAD SCHOOLED HIMSELF NOT TO WINCE
ITS HARSH CRY FROM THE MEADOW ON THE LEFT THE CROW OF A COCK ROSE CLEAR FROM THE VALLEY HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND RODE BRISKLY ON DOWN THE INCLINE IN FRONT OF HIM AND UP THE ASCENT BEYOND
TO GATHER UP HER FACULTIES AGAIN UNDER COMMAND SO SHE SPOKE OF THE UNIMPORTANT THING TO GAIN THE TIME YOU WERE IN THE CHURCH THEN OR YOU HEARD US UPON THE STEPS OR YOU MET HIM AS HE RODE AWAY NOT ONE OF THE CONJECTURES IS RIGHT SAID DURRANCE WITH A SMILE
I TOOK CARE YOU SHOULD NOT SUSPECT SAID MISSUS ADAIR BUT I TRIED TO KEEP YOU WITH ALL MY WITS I TRIED NO MATCH MAKER IN THE WORLD EVER WORKED SO HARD TO BRING TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER AS I DID
FEVERSHAM RETURNS TO RAMELTON ON AN AUGUST MORNING OF THE SAME YEAR HARRY FEVERSHAM RODE ACROSS THE LENNON BRIDGE INTO RAMELTON THE FIERCE SUNS OF THE SOUDAN HAD TANNED HIS FACE
DURRANCE LEANED OUT OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT HARRY HE SHOUTED
IT IS A TRITE REFLECTION BUT THE PERSONAL APPLICATION OF IT IS APT TO TAKE AWAY THE BREATH IT WAS SO WITH DURRANCE AS HE THOUGHT HIMSELF BACKWARDS INTO THOSE DAYS WHEN HE HAD WALKED ON HIS OWN PATH
THE MELODIES WHICH SHE HAD PLAYED RANG IN HIS EARS NOW FOR THE GIRL POSSESSED THE GIFT OF MUSIC AND THE STRINGS OF HER VIOLIN SPOKE TO THE QUESTIONS OF HER BOW THERE WAS IN PARTICULAR AN OVERTURE THE MELUSINE OVERTURE
HOW LONG SHALL YOU STAY AT WIESBADEN SHE ASKED I CAN HARDLY TELL BUT AS LONG AS IT'S ADVISABLE HE ANSWERED THAT TELLS ME NOTHING AT ALL
THE SUN BLAZED UPON IT FROM SIX IN THE MORNING WITH AN INTOLERABLE HEAT AND ALL NIGHT THE WIND BLEW ACROSS IT PIERCINGLY COLD AND PLAYED WITH THE SAND AS IT WOULD BUILDING PYRAMIDS HOUSE HIGH AND LEVELLING THEM
I SUCCEEDED CONTINUED MISSUS ADAIR YOU TOLD ME THAT I HAD SUCCEEDED ONE MORNING IN THE ROW HOW GLAD I WAS YOU DID NOT NOTICE IT I AM SURE THE NEXT MOMENT
BUT THE FIGURE BENEATH THE LAMP NEVER STIRRED
DON'T GO FOR A MOMENT SHE SAID AND SHE LEFT THE FIREPLACE AND CAME TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM THE OCULIST AT WIESBADEN SHE ASKED HE GAVE YOU A HOPE DURRANCE STOOD MEDITATING WHETHER HE SHOULD LIE OR SPEAK THE TRUTH NO HE SAID AT LENGTH THERE IS NO HOPE
IT SEEMED STRANGE TO DURRANCE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT OF HIS GOOD LUCK
THAT YOU HARDLY CARED WHETHER HE WAS ALIVE OR DEAD I WAS PRETENDING NOT TO HAVE FOUND OUT THAT BEYOND EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU CARED FOR HIM SOME DAY OR OTHER WE SHOULD HAVE FAILED EACH ONE IN TURN I DARED NOT FAIL NOR DARED YOU
NO DURRANCE MIGHT HAVE UNDERSTOOD BUT HE HAD NEVER GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO MISSUS ADAIR AND SHE KNEW IT THE KNOWLEDGE RANKLED WITHIN HER AND HIS SIMPLE
THE ARAB BOWED HIS HEAD AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION ALEIKUM ES SALAM SAID HE AND HE WAITED
WE WERE ALONE IN THE DOG CART AND WE SPOKE OF THE FRIENDS WHOM ONE KNOWS FOR FRIENDS THE FIRST MOMENT AND WHOM ONE SEEMS TO RECOGNISE EVEN THOUGH ONE HAS NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE
HARRY FEVERSHAM WEARING THE PATCHED JUBBEH OF THE DERVISHES OVER HIS STAINED SKIN HIS HAIR FRIZZED ON THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD
ONE COULD NOT HELP LEARNING THAT ONE PASSED A MAN AND A WOMAN RIDING TOGETHER AND ONE CHANCED TO LOOK INTO THE WOMAN'S FACE AS ONE PASSED OR ONE SAW PERHAPS THE WOMAN ALONE AND TALKED WITH HER FOR A LITTLE WHILE
WHICH TROUBLED HER BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SINCE BY FAILURE SHE HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS LAST CHANCE OF HAPPINESS THERE LAY THE STING FOR HER BUT IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT HE SAID ONCE OR TWICE AS I SAID YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD
GLIMMERED AND THREW UNCERTAIN LIGHTS AND UNCERTAIN SHADOWS OVER A SMALL CIRCLE BEYOND THE CIRCLE ALL WAS BLACK DARKNESS EXCEPT AT THE BOWS WHERE THE WATER BREAKING ON BOARD FLUNG A WHITE SHEET OF SPRAY
ENUNCIATED THE TOWNS FROM DONGOLA NO GLEAM IN THE ARAB'S EYES RESPONDED TO THAT NAME FROM METEMNEH FROM BERBER FROM OMDURMAN AH
HE FIRST SAW THE SAND STRETCHED LIKE A LAGOON UP TO THE DARK BROWN WALLS OF THE TOWN AND THE OVERSHADOWING FOLIAGE OF THE BIG DATE PALMS RISING ON THE NILE BANK BEYOND
ABOU FATMA TOOK HIS KNIFE FROM THE SMALL OF HIS BACK AND PICKING UP A STICK FROM THE GROUND NOTCHED IT THRICE AT EACH END THIS SHALL BE A SIGN TO MOUSSA FEDIL AND HE HANDED THE STICK TO HIS COMPANION
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T HELP WISHING THAT WE HAD BEEN GOING OUT TOGETHER
LITTLE BIGGER THAN A POSTAGE STAMP THE PACKAGE WAS A GOAT'S BLADDER AND ENCLOSED WITHIN THE BLADDER WAS A NOTE WRITTEN IN ARABIC AND FOLDED VERY SMALL
SO THAT HE UTTERED IT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY OR ANY SIGN OF FOREBODING EVEN SO HOWEVER HE HAD A FEAR THAT PERHAPS HIS FRIEND MIGHT PLACE ANOTHER INTERPRETATION UPON THE WORDS AND HE LOOKED QUICKLY INTO HIS FACE
A WARREN OF RUINED HOUSES FACING UPON NARROW ALLEYS AND WINDING STREETS THE FRONT WALLS HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN THE ROOFS CARRIED AWAY ONLY THE BARE INNER WALLS WERE LEFT STANDING
SO YOU ARE GOING SHE SAID IN TWO DAYS TIME YOU WILL BE AT WIESBADEN
DURRANCE FOUND HIMSELF BESET BY A STRANGE ILLUSION HE WAS LEANING UPON THE BULWARKS IDLY WONDERING WHETHER THIS WAS HIS LAST VIEW OF ENGLAND AND WITH A WISH THAT SOME ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD COME DOWN TO SEE HIM GO
EFFENDI FEVERSHAM HE SAID BUT IN VAIN THE ARAB COULD NOT SPEAK HE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS TELL HIS NAME
YES SHE SAID AND AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE WENT FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE DID NOT SHIRK THE PART WHICH SHE HAD ALLOTTED TO HERSELF SHE STEPPED OUT FROM THE SECRET CHAMBER OF HER GRIEF AS SOON AS SHE WAS SUMMONED
IT WAS SURELY THE MEREST MADNESS FOR A MAN TO IMAGINE THAT HE COULD ESCAPE
DURRANCE STOOD AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS HER UNTIL SHE HAD ENDED THEN HE WALKED TO HER SIDE I WAS RATHER A BRUTE HE SAID QUIETLY TO ASK YOU TO PLAY THAT OVERTURE TO NIGHT I WASN'T ANXIOUS TO PLAY SHE ANSWERED AS SHE LAID THE VIOLIN ASIDE I KNOW
THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS TO STAY BEHIND FEVERSHAM RODE BY HIS FRIEND'S SIDE IN SILENCE THEN AS THEY CAME TO THE CHAIRS BENEATH THE TREES HE SAID THAT WAS EXPECTED THE DAY YOU DINED WITH ME I SENT IN MY PAPERS
THE STARS HIS FACE SHOULD BE SET TOWARDS OBAK NOW HE MUST GO STEADILY FORWARD AMONGST THE CROWDS LIKE A MAN THAT HAS BUSINESS OF MOMENT DREADING CONVERSATION LEST HIS TONGUE SHOULD BETRAY HIM
THE ARAB ANSWERED TO THAT WORD HE CLOSED HIS EYELIDS CALDER WENT ON STILL MORE EAGERLY YOU WERE WOUNDED THERE NO WHERE THEN AT BERBER YES YOU WERE IN PRISON
HOWEVER NECESSARY IT WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE SPOKEN BUT AS THEY STOOD OVER AGAINST ONE ANOTHER SHE HAD FORCED HERSELF TO REMEMBER THAT NECESSITY UNTIL SHE ACTUALLY RECOGNISED AND FELT IT THEN SHE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE CHURCH AND TAKEN A SEAT AND GATHERED UP HER STRENGTH
AND PURPOSELY SET AGAINST IT WORDS WHICH FEVERSHAM HAD SPOKEN AND WHICH HE KNEW TO BE TRUE ETHNE EUSTACE WOULD HARDLY BE HAPPY OUTSIDE HER COUNTY OF DONEGAL THEREFORE EVEN HAD THINGS FALLEN OUT DIFFERENTLY AS HE PHRASED IT
SHE SAW THAT HIS FACE LOST SOMETHING OF ITS STERNNESS HE WAS STANDING QUIETLY PREPARED NOW TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE MIGHT WISH TO SAY HE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN HE COULD SEE
THE WIND HAD FRESHENED DURING THE DINNER AND BLOWING UP STREAM HAD RAISED WAVES SO THAT THE STEAMER AND ITS BARGE TOSSED AND THE WATER BROKE ON BOARD HE WAS BELOW THERE
AGAIN HARRY FEVERSHAM WAS CONSCIOUS OF A REPROACH IN HIS FRIEND'S SILENCE AND AGAIN HE WAS WRONG FOR DURRANCE SUDDENLY SPOKE HEARTILY AND WITH A LAUGH I REMEMBER YOU GAVE US YOUR REASONS THAT NIGHT
THAT IS A LIE THE INJURY WAS DONE BY THE BLADE OF A SPEAR OR SOME WEAPON OF THE KIND ARE YOU SURE YES CALDER BENT DOWN SUDDENLY TOWARDS THE ARAB ON THE ANGAREB
BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD SHOULD I DO IF I HAD TO SIT IN A CHAIR ALL MY DAYS IT MAKES ME SHIVER TO THINK OF IT AND HE SHOOK HIS BROAD SHOULDERS TO UNSADDLE THAT FEAR WELL THIS IS THE LAST RIDE LET US GALLOP AND HE LET OUT HIS HORSE
INTERRUPTED FEVERSHAM INDEED I REMEMBER AND WHOM ONE NEVER LOSES WHETHER ABSENT OR DEAD CONTINUED ETHNE I SAID THAT ONE COULD ALWAYS BE SURE OF SUCH FRIENDS AND YOU ANSWERED I ANSWERED THAT ONE COULD MAKE MISTAKES AGAIN
YOU AND ETHNE IN THE ROOM I ALONE UPON THE TERRACE I WONDER WHETHER IT WILL ALWAYS BE SO BUT YOU WILL NOT SAY YOU WILL NOT SAY
IT BECAME THAT INESTIMABLE DIAMOND
FORGIVE A STRANGER ONE OVERWHELM'D WITH SORROWS LIKE YOURSELF IF HE ASKS YOU BY WHAT AMAZING ACCIDENT HE FINDS THE NAME OF ZADIG DELINEATED BY SO ANGELICK A HAND
OF HIS POMPOUS HELMET HIS SUPERB CUIRASS HIS RICH BRACELETS HIS BRILLIANT CUISSES OR ARMOUR FOR HIS THIGHS AND OTHER MARTIAL ACCOUTREMENTS WHEN ZADIG HAD EQUIPP'D HIMSELF CAP A PEE IN HIS NOW RECOVER'D ARMOUR
AS FOR THAT VILLAIN ZADIG SAID HE HE HAS TAKEN HIS FLIGHT TOWARDS INDIA AND YOUR FALSE UNGRATEFUL CONSORT SIRE SAID HE IS FLED TO MEMPHIS
BUT APPROACHING NEARER AND PERCEIVING VERY DISTINCTLY
SINCE THEIR PARTING AND BY WHAT CHANCE HE CAME TO TRAVERSE THAT SOLITARY MEADOW BUT PREVENTED HIM AT THE SAME TIME FROM RETURNING ANY ANSWER BY REPEATING QUESTION UPON QUESTION
IN THE MEAN TIME HIS APOTHECARY
AND WITHOUT WHICH NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WHICH IN A WORD DEVOURS EVERY THING HOW MINUTE SOEVER AND YET GIVES LIFE AND SPIRIT TO EVERY OBJECT OR BEING HOWEVER GREAT ITOBAD
WHY DON'T YOU ADORE THE LAND OF THE GANGARIDES
MADE THE BEST CREAM CHEESES THAT WERE EVER EATEN IN THE PERSIAN EMPIRE
THROUGH SUCH AN ANTI MEDICINAL PREPARATION MIGHT POSSIBLY NOT ONLY RENDER HIMSELF THE OBJECT OF CONTEMPT IN THE EYE OF HIS GREAT MASTER BUT CAST A KIND OF SLUR IN GENERAL
TIS SOMEWHAT SURPRIZING SAID ZADIG MAY I BE SO BOLD PRAY AS TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE IN PURSUIT AFTER THAT SHUNS THE TOUCH OF ANY THING BUT THE HANDS OF THE FAIR SEX
I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL OF THAT AFFAIR REPLIED ARBOGAD ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT MOABDAR BECAME A PERFECT MADMAN AND HAD HIS BRAINS BEAT OUT
IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN WAS EVER SO NOTED FOR SELLING CREAM CHEESES AS MYSELF AND YET I AM RUIN'D TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES NO MAN OF MY PROFESSION EVER HAD A HANDSOMER MORE COMPLEAT HOUSEWIFE THAN MY DAME WAS
AND THE FAMOUS PRIME MINISTER ZADIG WERE VERY FOND OF THEM I SERV'D THE COURT WITH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THEM I WENT THE OTHER DAY IN HOPES OF BEING PAID BUT BEFORE I HAD WELL GOT INTO THE SUBURBS OF BABYLON
BUT YET HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING I WAS VERY PRETTY HE GAVE HIM THEREFORE PARTICULAR ORDERS TO TAKE CARE OF ME AND PUT ME UNDER THE SAME REGIMEN WITH RESPECT TO MY DIET
I HAVE SOME LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN I HAVE HEARD SAY NO ONE SELLS BETTER CREAM CHEESES THAN HE DOES DESIRE HIM NEXT TIME HE COMES TO BRING A SMALL PARCEL WITH HIM AND LET HIM KNOW I'LL TAKE CARE HE SHALL BE PUNCTUALLY PAID
AND FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD FELT SO MANY AGONIZING PAINS FOR A FEW MINUTES HE STOOD SPEECHLESS
THAT THE JEALOUS KING MY SPOUSE WAS DISGUSTED TO FIND YOU THE MOST AMIABLE OF ALL MORTALS AND THAT FOR NO OTHER REASON HE DETERMIN'D TO STRANGLE YOU AND POISON ME
SURE YOU ARE A MESSENGER OF HEAVEN SENT DOWN TO BE MY SAVIOUR IN THE MEAN TIME ZADIG EVERY NOW AND THEN ASK'D HIM QUESTIONS AND WEPT AS HE ASK'D THEM WHAT SIR SAID THE FISHERMAN
DESERVES SEVERELY TO BE PUNISH'D BUT FOR THE GENERALITY WE FIND SUCH WORTHLESS BARBARIANS ARE THE FAVOURITES OF FORTUNE BE THAT HOWEVER AS IT WILL GO AS I BADE YOU TO MY FRIEND CADOR
DESTERHAM PLUNDERING BY VIRTUE OF HIS MAJESTY'S MANDATE ALL HIS EFFECTS IN THE MOST LOYAL MANNER FROM THENCE I MADE THE BEST OF MY WAY TO THE QUEEN'S KITCHIN
I CARRY SOME OF IT ALWAYS IN MY POCKET AS TO MY ANCESTORS
BUT THIS I KNOW TO MY SORROW THAT NEITHER THE QUEEN NOR ZADIG EVER PAID ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD FOR MY CREAM CHEESES THAT MY DEAR SPOUSE IS TAKEN FROM ME AND THAT I AM DROVE TO THE VERY BRINK OF DESPAIR
LIKE THE MOST SERVILE DOMESTIC THE SAUCY HYRCANIAN WITHOUT SO MUCH AS VOUCHSAFING ME ONE SINGLE WORD TURN'D TO HIS BLACK EUNUCH AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS VERY IMPERTINENT
RETURN'D WITH A POWERFUL ARMY IN ORDER TO FORM A THIRD PARTY AMONG THE BABYLONIANS HE ATTACK'D THE KING WHO FLED WITH HIS FAIR BUT FICKLE EGYPTIAN BEFORE HIM
THOSE WHO LAID HOLD ON THEM FIRST FELL A SACRIFICE TO THEIR FURY THEIR NUMBERS REDOUBLED YET STILL BOTH DAUNTLESS DETERMIN'D TO CONQUER OR TO DIE WHEN TWO MEN DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST A WHOLE GANG
THAT HE MARRIED HER THE NEXT DAY ZADIG WENT AFTERWARDS TO THROW HIMSELF AT THE FEET OF HIS FAIR BENEFACTRESS
AND OUT OF PRIDE AND OSTENTATION THAN ANY REAL LOVE FOR THE DECEAS'D HE TALK'D TO HER FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME SO RATIONALLY
O YE IMMORTAL POWERS CRIED HE WHO PRESIDE OVER THE DESTINY OF US FRAIL MORTALS
ACCORDINGLY ORDER'D HIS WHOLE RETINUE
ALL IN GENERAL WERE LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES AND IN THEIR HEARTS WISH'D HIM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXCEPT THE ENVIOUS MAN WHO AS HE PASS'D BY FETCH'D A DEEP SIGH AND TURN'D HIS HEAD ASIDE THE POPULACE
CRIED OUT FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT WHY SAID THE EGYPTIAN I DESIGN TO MAKE A WING OF THIS FOWL ONE PART OF MY SUPPER PRAY GOOD SIR CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING SAID THE INDIAN
AND THAT BLOOD SHED WOULD ENSUE ZADIG WHO HADN'T ONCE OPEN'D HIS LIPS DURING THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY AT LAST ROSE UP
DULY SIGN'D BY FOUR SEVERAL HANDS AND TOLD THEM THE DEFINITIVE TREATY BETWEEN ALL THE CONTRACTING PARTIES EACH OF THE PONTIFICAL GALLANTS OBSERV'D THEIR SUMMONS TO A MOMENT
AND THE QUEEN'S LOVE FOR ZADIG HAD MADE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON HERS THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO DISCOVER IN THE MEAN TIME ZADIG AGAIN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO OGUL SAID
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS SWAY'D BY LOVE AND JUSTICE EVERY ONE BLEST ZADIG AND ZADIG BLEST HEAV'N FOR HIS UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
THE CASE BEING THUS CIRCUMSTANTIATED SIR I HOPE YOU WILL NOT INTERRUPT ME ANY LONGER LEST MY RIVALS HERE IN THE FIELD SHOULD HAPPEN TO CIRCUMVENT ME ZADIG WITHDREW
BUT AFTER HE HAD VIEW'D THE LADY WITH AN ATTENTIVE EYE HE FOUND SHE WAS EXTREMELY PRETTY AND WAS SOON PACIFY'D HER NAME
SURELY YOU MUST BE OUT A LITTLE IN YOUR CALCULATION TIS BUT ABOUT FOURSCORE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE INDIA WAS FIRST INHABITED SURE I AM
THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN BABYLON ARE CUTTING ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS AND THAT THE WHOLE EMPIRE IS LAID WASTE THAT THERE IS STILL AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING SEVERAL BOLD PUSHES AND LET ME TELL YOU SIR I HAVE DONE MY PART
INCENS'D TO THE LAST DEGREE GOT UP AND DREW HIS SWORD ZADIG SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WITH HIS SABRE IN HIS HAND NOW BEHOLD THE TWO CHIEFTAINS UPON THEIR LEGS COMMENCING A NEW TRIAL OF SKILL WHERE THEY SEEM'D TO GET THE BETTER OF EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY
TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
AND LEFT THE COMBATANTS TO REST THEIR WEARIED LIMBS TILL THE NEXT MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE VICTOR WAS TO PRODUCE HIS DEVICE BEFORE THE GRAND MAGUS IN ORDER TO CONFER NOTES AND DISCOVER THE HERO WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE ZADIG SLEPT VERY SOUND
TO TOUCH A PIECE OF FISH BESIDES YOU CANNOT JUSTLY BOAST OF SO ILLUSTRIOUS AN ORIGIN AND YOU ARE BOTH OF YOU MERE MODERNS IN COMPARISON TO US CHALDEANS YOU EGYPTIANS LAY CLAIM TO
AS TO BURN ONE CORNER OF THE CRUST WHEREUPON SHE GAVE HIS POST TO HER FAVOURITE DWARF AND MADE HER FOP OF A PAGE THE KEEPER OF HIS MAJESTY'S GREAT SEAL AND CONFIDENCE
THAT ACTS THE TYRANT O'ER HIS SUBJECTS ONE WHO COULD THINK OF MURDERING AN INNOCENT WIFE
VISIT THE EARTH THREE HOURS EVERY DAY FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF MANKIND HE HAD A NUMEROUS ISSUE AS IS VERY WELL KNOWN AND ALL OF THEM WERE POWERFUL MONARCHS I HAVE A PICTURE OF IT AT HOME TO WHICH AS IN DUTY I OUGHT
AS THE TEARS TRICKL'D DOWN AFRESH HER LOVELY CHEEKS TWENTY TIMES SHE ENDEAVOUR'D TO RENEW HER DISCOURSE BUT WAS INTERRUPTED BY HER SIGHS SHE ASK'D HIM OVER AND OVER
AND TO EXPLAIN ALL SUCH A ENIGMAS OR RIDDLES AS THE MAGI SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PROPOSE IF THEIR QUERIES SHOULD PROVE TOO INTRICATE AND PERPLEXT FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THEY WERE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LISTS AGAIN AND AFTER THAT TO FRESH A ENIGMAS
WHICH WOULD NOT HE FLATTER'D HIMSELF BE LONG UNEXECUTED
ACCORDING TO HIS LOT CADOR WHO WAS JUST RETURN'D TO BABYLON HAVING HUNTED ALL EGYPT OVER TO NO PURPOSE IN HOPES TO FIND HIS FRIEND ZADIG BROUGHT A COMPLEAT SET OF ARMOUR INTO HIS LODGE BY EXPRESS ORDERS FROM THE QUEEN
ON THAT VERY DAY WHEN THOSE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ENGAG'D IN THE LIST OR CIRCUS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE SPACIOUS OUTER COURT OF THE PALACE
WHICH REDOUBLED HIS VIGOUR AND HIS HOPES THE NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN BEING SEATED UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE ENRICH'D WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND THE AMPHITHEATRES BEING CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ALL RANKS AND CONDITIONS FROM BABYLON
THE WHOLE TRAIN OF SLAVES AFTER A LONG FRUITLESS SEARCH ATTENDED ON OGUL TO INFORM HIM THAT ALL THEIR STRICTEST SEARCH WAS FRUITLESS ZADIG DESIRED
A THIRD INDEED SAID THAT SHE HAD MADE HER ESCAPE BY FLIGHT ALL IN GENERAL HOWEVER ASSUR'D ME FOR MY COMFORT THAT MY CHEESES WOULD NEVER BE PAID FOR FROM THENCE I WENT WITH MY WIFE IN MY HAND TO LORD ORCAN'S
DO YOU COMMUNICATE THESE SENTIMENTS TO THE SOVEREIGNS OF YOUR TRIBES AND IN THE MEAN WHILE I'LL GO AND SOUND THE WIDOW'S INCLINATIONS ACCORDINGLY HE PAID HER A VISIT AND HAVING INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO HER FAVOUR
HE HAS INTIMATED TO HIM THAT AT PRESENT HIS LIFE'S IN DANGER AND NOTHING WILL RESTORE HIM BUT A BASILISK BOIL'D IN ROSE WATER
OF A CERTAIN PRINCE OF HYRCANIA TIS VERY POSSIBLE
WHEN ZADIG HAD TRAVELLED SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM ARBOGAD'S CASTLE HE FOUND HIMSELF ARRIV'D AT THE BANKS OF A LITTLE RIVER INCESSANTLY DEPLORING AS HE WENT ALONG HIS UNHAPPY FATE AND LOOKING UPON HIMSELF AS THE VERY PICTURE OF ILL LUCK
THO THE SOVEREIGN OF THE SEA CONTINUED HE
IN THE MOST COURTEOUS MANNER IF HE MIGHT HAVE THE HONOUR TO ASSIST HER IN HER RESEARCHES HAVE A CARE SAID SHE WHAT WE ARE HUNTING AFTER SIR IS AN ANIMAL THAT WILL NOT SUFFER ITSELF TO BE TOUCH'D BY A MAN
IF SHE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ESCAPE THE RESENTMENT OF THOSE POPULAR TUMULTS BUT MY HEAD SIR IS BETTER TURN'D FOR THE HIGHWAY THAN FOR NEWS I HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL LADIES PRISONERS
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A GRAIN OF SAND THAT BEMOAN'D ITSELF AS BEING NOTHING MORE THAN A WORTHLESS ATOM OF THE DESERTS
YOU KNOW VERY WELL TOO THAT INDULGENT HEAV'N INSPIR'D AS IT WERE MY LITTLE DWARF WITH ARTFUL MEANS TO GIVE ME TIMELY NOTICE OF THE RASH RESOLUTIONS OF THE KING MY CRUEL HUSBAND NO SOONER
OF THE JUSTLY ADMIR'D ASTARTE AND REFLECTING ON HIS OWN STARS THAT SO OBSTINATELY DARTED DOWN THEIR MALIGNANT RAYS AND CONTINU'D DAILY TO TORMENT HIM WHAT
BUT TWO PERSONS IN BAD CIRCUMSTANCES ARE LIKE TWO WEAK SHRUBS WHICH BY PROPPING UP EACH OTHER ARE FENC'D AGAINST A STORM WHY ARE YOU THUS CAST DOWN SAID ZADIG TO THE FISHERMAN
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE CHAOS AND THAT THE WORLD AS IT NOW STANDS IS OWING WHOLLY TO MATTER AND FORM THE GREEK RAN ON FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME
MISSOUF CAJOL'D WITH THE HINT CAME INTO MY MEASURES DIRECTLY SHE TOOK CARE TO SEND ME PACKING FORTHWITH WITH NO OTHER ATTENDANT THAN AN OLD EGYPTIAN SLAVE
AND SWORE A THOUSAND TIMES OVER THAT HE WAS THE HAPPIEST CREATURE UPON GOD'S EARTH PERSUADING ZADIG TO BE AS MERRY AND THOUGHTLESS AS HIMSELF AT LAST BEING GRADUALLY OVERCOME BY THE FUMES OF HIS LIQUOR
WHEREUPON I WROTE A DOLEFUL LETTER TO MY WIFE IN ALL THE AGONIES OF ONE IN THE DEEPEST DESPAIR TIS VERY WELL
ALL THE FAVOUR I REQUEST IS THE RELEASE OF ONE OF YOUR BABYLONISH SLAVES WHO HAS BEEN IN YOUR HIGHNESS'S RETINUE FOR SOME TIME AND I
WHILE ABOUT AN IMPORTANT TOPICK IN WHICH TIS EVIDENT YOU ARE ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED
AT A CERTAIN PLACE AS SOON AS THE STAR ALGENIB SHOULD MAKE ITS APPEARANCE FROM HIM SHE REPAIR'D TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PONTIFF TAKING CARE WHEREVER SHE WENT
BUT AS YOU APPEAR SIR TO ME TO BE A GENTLEMAN OF UNCOMMON COURAGE YOU SHALL PROVE AN EXCEPTION TO MY GENERAL RULE UPON THIS HE INVITED ZADIG INTO HIS MAGNIFICENT MANSION
HE FELL PROSTRATE ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE WAX LIGHTS O YE EVERLASTING EVER SHINING LUMINARIES
WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING BROW BEAT IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE INSISTED THAT THE CHIEF MAGUS WHO WAS OLD AND GOUTY SHOULD DANCE A SARABAND BEFORE HER AND UPON HIS MODEST REFUSAL
TO INFORM HER LOVER OF ALL THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES ABOVEMENTION'D NOT DOUBTING BUT THAT HE WOULD EXERT BOTH HIS COURAGE AND UNDERSTANDING FOR HER SAKE BEYOND ANY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS ZADIG ACCORDINGLY SET OUT FOR BABYLON AND BESOUGHT THE GODDESS VENUS
OR BY THE EDUCATION OF SUCH AS DEMANDED THEIR MATERNAL INDULGENCE AND
BUT THE FISH AS WELL AS ALL MANKIND DESERT ME I SCARCE CATCH ONE IN A DAY I AM HALF STARV'D AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOUR UNEXPECTED BENEVOLENCE AND GENEROSITY I HAD BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER BEFORE THIS
JUDGE THE DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS I WAS UNDER UPON HIS MAKING SUCH A PEREMPTORY DECLARATION
AND THE SOVEREIGN OF BABYLON SHOULD BE THE RESULT OF MERIT ONLY AND NOT BE PROCUR'D BY ANY PARTY FACTIONS OR COURT INTRIGUES A SOLEMN OATH WAS VOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY ALL PARTIES
I NEVER SAW BEFORE ALAS SAID THE WIDOW WITH A MODEST BLUSH MY ARM SIR TIS PROBABLE MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ANY HIDDEN PART BUT SEE GOOD FATHER
THAT THE WHITE ARMOUR WAS ZADIG'S PROPERTY HE WAS THEREUPON ACKNOWLEDG'D KING OF BABYLON BY THE UNANIMOUS CONTENT OF THE WHOLE COURT BUT MORE PARTICULARLY
AND DIVISIBLE TO INFINITY IN PART ALL MEN NEGLECT IT IN THE PASSAGE AND ALL REGRET THE LOSS OF IT WHEN TIS PAST NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT IT IT BURIES IN OBLIVION WHATEVER IS UNWORTHY OF BEING TRANSMITTED
THE PRINCE OF HYRCANIA CAME TO BABYLON AND SWEPT ALL BEFORE HIM MY LITTLE COTTAGE WITH ALL ITS FURNITURE WAS FIRST PLUNDER'D OF ALL THAT WAS VALUABLE AND AT LAST REDUC'D TO ASHES HAVING THUS LOST MY MONEY
AND WAS TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OCCURRENCES WERE GOVERN'D BY A MALIGNANT DESTINY WHICH NEVER FAIL'D TO OPPRESS THE VIRTUOUS AND ALWAYS CROWN'D THE ACTIONS OF SUCH VILLAINS AS THE GREEN KNIGHT WITH UNCOMMON SUCCESS IN ONE OF HIS FRANTICK FITS
WHO CONVEY'D ME TO YONDER CASTLE THE MAGNIFICENT RESIDENCE OF THE EMIR OGUL HE PURCHAS'D ME AT ALL ADVENTURES
HE ANSWER'D THAT HE PRESUM'D HIS PREMIUM HAD HE SUCCEEDED MIGHT HAVE AMOUNTED TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD
CORPSE OF MY DECEASED AUNT SAID HE WHO WAS ONE OF THE FINEST WOMEN IN ALL EGYPT SHE WAS MY CONSTANT COMPANION BUT UNHAPPILY DIED UPON THE ROAD I HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH CARE
ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES
THE DEMANDS OF THE REBELS WERE SO EXORBITANT THAT NORFOLK REJECTED THEM AND THEY PREPARED AGAIN TO DECIDE THE CONTEST BY ARMS THEY WERE AS FORMIDABLE AS EVER BOTH BY THEIR NUMBERS AND SPIRIT
IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
WHICH HAD LONG DISTURBED THE GOVERNMENT AND WHICH THE CREDULITY OF THE PEOPLE AND THE ARTIFICES OF MALCONTENTS WERE STILL CAPABLE OF REVIVING
HE WAS ABLE VERY EFFECTUALLY THOUGH IN A COVERT MANNER TO PROMOTE THE LATE INNOVATIONS CRANMER
THE TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE WITH THE SUPREME BEING IN CONFORMITY TO THE LUTHERANS AND OTHER PROTESTANTS THEY ASSERTED THAT SALVATION WAS OBTAINED BY FAITH ALONE AND THAT THE MOST INFALLIBLE ROAD TO PERDITION WAS A RELIANCE ON GOOD WORKS
AND HE TOOK THENCE OCCASION TO PRAISE THE KING FOR HIS WONDERFUL GIFTS OF GRACE AND NATURE HE COMPARED HIM FOR JUSTICE AND PRUDENCE TO SOLOMON FOR STRENGTH AND FORTITUDE TO SAMSON AND FOR BEAUTY AND COMELINESS TO ABSALOM
HAD BEEN OFFENDED WITH HER ON ACCOUNT OF THE PART WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN IN HER MOTHER'S QUARREL HER ADVANCES WERE NOT AT FIRST RECEIVED AND HENRY EXACTED FROM HER SOME FURTHER PROOFS OF SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE
BY THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS CONDUCT HE WOULD BE APT TO THINK HAD SHOWN HIMSELF SO LITTLE WORTHY OF THAT ADVANTAGE WHICH FORTUNE AND FORTUNE ALONE HAD PUT INTO HIS HANDS HIS MINISTERS HIS FRIENDS HIS SUBJECTS HIS ALLIES
FELL UPON SIR JAMES WINDHAM AND SIR JAMES TYRREL WHO WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR TRIAL CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED THE FATE OF THE LATTER GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF THE YOUNG PRINCES
THIS RENOWNED CITY EXPOSED BY HER RENOWN ALONE TO SO MANY CALAMITIES NEVER ENDURED IN ANY AGE EVEN FROM THE BARBARIANS BY WHOM SHE WAS OFTEN SUBDUED SUCH INDIGNITIES AS SHE WAS NOW COMPELLED TO SUFFER
IT WAS EVEN AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM THAT BY HIS CONNIVANCE HE HAD ENCOURAGED THE GROWTH OF HERESY AND THAT HE HAD PROTECTED AND ACQUITTED SOME NOTORIOUS OFFENDERS SIR THOMAS MORE WHO SUCCEEDED WOLSEY AS CHANCELLOR
I EXPECT THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR COMPLAISANCE FURTHER SAID THE KING I DESIRE TO HAVE SUFFOLK PUT INTO MY HANDS WHERE ALONE I CAN DEPEND UPON HIS SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE
AND BEGAT A UNIVERSAL DIFFIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE NATION IN VAIN
THE GREATER PART OF THE NATION WAS CONVINCED OF THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS WIFE'S TITLE
AND FOR THAT PURPOSE HE SENT CHRISTOPHER MOUNT TO A CONGRESS WHICH THEY HELD AT BRUNSWICK BUT THAT MINISTER MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS IN HIS NEGOTIATION THE PRINCES WISHED TO KNOW
HE WENT THROUGH NORFOLK TEACHING THE PEOPLE TO BEWARE OF IDOLATRY AND OF TRUSTING FOR THEIR SALVATION EITHER TO PILGRIMAGES OR TO THE COWL OF SAINT FRANCIS TO THE PRAYERS OF THE SAINTS OR TO IMAGES
EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
CONTRACTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES AN EVENT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ATTENDED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES THE SAME YEAR ANOTHER MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WHICH WAS ALSO IN THE NEXT AGE PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT EVENTS
AND WHO KEPT A SECRET CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUFFOLK THEY INFORMED HIM THAT RESENTMENT AGAINST THE KING'S REPLY WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE WHICH RETAINED THE MALECONTENTS IN ARMS AND THAT A MILDER ANSWER WOULD PROBABLY SUPPRESS THE REBELLION
AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF EXHIBITIONERS AND THE POOR OF THEIR PARISH THE SECULAR PRIESTS FINDING THEMSELVES THUS REDUCED TO A GRIEVOUS SERVITUDE INSTILLED INTO THE PEOPLE THOSE DISCONTENTS WHICH THEY HAD LONG HARBORED IN THEIR OWN BOSOMS
AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
SUITED TO VULGAR CAPACITY IT WAS ABLE NOW THAT IT WAS BROUGHT INTO APPARENT HAZARD TO RAISE THE STRONGEST ZEAL IN ITS FAVOR
AND RETURNED AT LAST INTO THE LOW COUNTRIES WHERE HE WAS PROTECTED THOUGH NOT COUNTENANCED BY PHILIP THEN IN CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE KING
BEFORE THE DUKE OF NORFOLK AND OTHERS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND THIS SOLEMN ACT HE ACCOMPANIED WITH THE MOST SOLEMN PROTESTATIONS OF VERACITY THE QUEEN HOWEVER
WHEN THE SUBSIDY BEGAN TO BE LEVIED IN CORNWALL THE INHABITANTS NUMEROUS AND POOR ROBUST AND COURAGEOUS
MET WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS AND SEVERAL OTHER RISINGS WERE SUPPRESSED BY THE VIGILANCE OF NORFOLK THE KING ENRAGED BY THESE MULTIPLIED REVOLTS WAS DETERMINED NOT TO ADHERE TO THE GENERAL PARDON WHICH HE HAD GRANTED
BUT EVEN HER ENEMIES EXPECTED LITTLE ADVANTAGE FROM THIS CONFESSION FOR THEY NEVER DARED TO CONFRONT HIM WITH HER AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED AS WERE ALSO BRERETON AND WESTON NORRIS HAD BEEN MUCH IN THE KING'S FAVOR
DAUBENEY BEAT A DETACHMENT OF THE REBELS FROM DEPTFORD BRIDGE AND BEFORE THEIR MAIN BODY COULD BE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE HIM HE HAD GAINED THE ASCENT OF THE HILL AND PLACED HIMSELF IN ARRAY BEFORE THEM THEY WERE FORMIDABLE FROM THEIR NUMBERS
TO PREVAIL IN THE MOST TRIVIAL INCIDENTS AND MEN ON ANY AFFRONT OR INJURY THOUGHT THEMSELVES ENTITLED OR EVEN REQUIRED IN HONOR TO TAKE REVENGE ON THEIR ENEMIES BY OPENLY VINDICATING THEIR RIGHT IN SINGLE COMBAT
AND WHEN I COME DOWN AGAIN LET ME SHIFT FOR MYSELF THE EXECUTIONER ASKING HIM FORGIVENESS HE GRANTED THE REQUEST BUT TOLD HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET CREDIT BY BEHEADING ME MY NECK IS SO SHORT
WAS SENT OVER TO RATIFY THE TREATY AND WAS RECEIVED AT LONDON WITH ALL THE PARADE WHICH SUITED THE SOLEMNITY OF THE OCCASION THE TERROR OF THE EMPEROR'S GREATNESS HAD EXTINGUISHED THE ANCIENT ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THE NATIONS AND SPAIN
IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
AND THROWN INTO SUCH A SUPERSTITIOUS ATTACHMENT TO THE ANCIENT FAITH THAT FEW INQUISITORS HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF GREATER VIOLENCE IN THEIR PROSECUTION OF HERESY
MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
IT WAS STIPULATED BY THAT KING THE POPE THE VENETIANS THE SWISS THE FLORENTINES AND THE DUKE OF MILAN AMONG OTHER ARTICLES THAT THEY WOULD OBLIGE THE EMPEROR TO DELIVER UP THE TWO YOUNG PRINCES OF FRANCE ON RECEIVING A REASONABLE SUM OF MONEY
AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED BY THIS CONFESSION TO PRONOUNCE THE MARRIAGE NULL AND INVALID HENRY IN THE TRANSPORTS OF HIS FURY DID NOT PERCEIVE
AND FOUND THAT HIS DIGNITY WHICH PROCURED HIM NO REGARD FROM THE SPANISH SOLDIERS DID BUT DRAW ON HIM THE INSOLENT MOCKERY OF THE GERMAN WHO BEING GENERALLY ATTACHED TO THE LUTHERAN PRINCIPLES
HENRY NEGLECTED NOT THE PRESENT OPPORTUNITY OF COMPLAINING TO HIS GUEST OF THE RECEPTION WHICH SUFFOLK HAD MET WITH IN HIS DOMINIONS
BEING SIXTEEN THOUSAND STRONG AND WERE NOT DEFECTIVE IN VALOR BUT BEING TUMULTUARY TROOPS ILL ARMED AND NOT PROVIDED WITH CAVALRY OR ARTILLERY THEY WERE BUT AN UNEQUAL MATCH FOR THE KING'S FORCES
BOTH THAT HIS ALLY FRANCIS WAS LIKELY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF WITHOUT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND THAT HIS OWN TRANQUILLITY WAS FULLY INSURED
TO DELIVER HIMSELF INTO THE KING'S HANDS
WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
BY THESE VIOLENT WARS AND ANIMOSITIES ON THE CONTINENT IF ANY INQUIETUDE REMAINED WITH THE ENGLISH COURT IT WAS SOLELY OCCASIONED BY THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN SCOTLAND JAMES HEARING OF THE DANGEROUS SITUATION OF HIS ALLY FRANCIS
IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PARLIAMENTS AND GREAT NOBILITY OF BOTH KINGDOMS SHOULD GIVE THEIR ASSENT TO IT THE MARESCHAL MONTMORENCY ACCOMPANIED BY MANY PERSONS OF DISTINCTION
THAT THE KING'S AFFLICTION WAS DROWNED IN HIS JOY AND HE EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION ON THE OCCASION THE PRINCE NOT SIX DAYS OLD WAS CREATED PRINCE OF WALES DUKE OF CORNWALL AND EARL OF CHESTER SIR EDWARD SEYMOUR THE QUEEN'S BROTHER
BUT HE FOUND IT NOT SO EASY TO LEVY THE MONEY UPON HIS SUBJECTS THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE IMMENSE TREASURES WHICH HE HAD AMASSED COULD ILL BROOK THE NEW IMPOSITIONS RAISED ON EVERY SLIGHT OCCASION
HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO EXERT THAT VIGOR WHICH BECAME HIM AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE FAITH AND AFTER AMITY WITH THE EMPEROR WAS ONCE FULLY RESTORED HE SHOULD THEN BE IN A SITUATION
HE CASUALLY STEERED A COURSE WHICH LED MORE CERTAINLY TO ARBITRARY POWER THAN ANY WHICH THE MOST PROFOUND POLITICS COULD HAVE TRACED OUT TO HIM ARTIFICE REFINEMENT AND HYPOCRISY IN HIS SITUATION
CONSTANTINE AND OTHERS WHO DREADING THE EXERTION OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY HAD FLED TO ANTWERP WHERE THE GREAT PRIVILEGES POSSESSED BY THE LOW COUNTRY PROVINCES SERVED DURING SOME TIME TO GIVE THEM PROTECTION
THE QUEEN HERSELF WROTE HENRY A LETTER FROM THE TOWER
IN WHICH HE EMPLOYED A VERY LOFTY STYLE SUITED TO SO HAUGHTY A MONARCH HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY OUGHT NO MORE TO PRETEND GIVING A JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT THAT A BLIND MAN WITH REGARD TO COLORS
THAN THE TRANSACTIONS IN SPAIN FERDINAND AS WELL AS HENRY HAD BECOME VERY UNPOPULAR AND FROM A LIKE CAUSE HIS FORMER EXACTIONS AND IMPOSITIONS
AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
HE DEPRIVED HIMSELF OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND ARMING HIS OPPRESSOR WITH THE WHOLE FORCE AND WEALTH OF THAT OPULENT COUNTRY RENDERED HIM ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE TO THESE GREAT VIEWS OF INTEREST WERE ADDED THE MOTIVES
MIGHT BE TEMPTED BY AMBITION TO LAY IMMEDIATE CLAIM TO THE CROWN BY HIS PERPETUAL ATTENTION TO DEPRESS THE PARTISANS OF THE YORK FAMILY
THAT FRANCIS SHOULD EVACUATE GENOA AND ALL THE FORTRESSES HELD BY HIM IN ITALY AND HE DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF BRINGING SFORZA TO A TRIAL AND CONFISCATING THE DUCHY OF MILAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PRETENDED TREASON
THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
AND HE MADE A SACRIFICE OF HIS LIFE TO HIS INTEGRITY WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE THAT HE MAINTAINED IN ANY ORDINARY OCCURRENCE WHEN HE WAS MOUNTING THE SCAFFOLD HE SAID TO ONE FRIEND HELP ME UP
AND HAD FORTIFIED THEMSELVES IN AN HABITUAL DETESTATION OF THOSE WHO WERE DENOMINATED HERETICS THEY ADHERED WITH MORE OBSTINACY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THEIR EDUCATION AND THE LIMITS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS THENCEFORTH REMAINED FIXED AND UNCHANGEABLE
HAD PRODUCED A SINCERE BUT INDOLENT ACQUIESCENCE IN RECEIVED OPINIONS AND THE MULTITUDE WERE NEITHER ATTACHED TO THEM BY TOPICS OF REASONING
SHE GRASPED IT IN HER HAND AND SMILED WHEN BROUGHT HOWEVER TO THE SCAFFOLD SHE SOFTENED HER TONE A LITTLE WITH REGARD TO HER PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE SHE PROBABLY REFLECTED
HAD GIVEN HIM VERY ENLARGED SENTIMENTS AND WHO HAD IN HIS EARLY YEARS ADVANCED PRINCIPLES WHICH EVEN AT PRESENT
HENRY'S COMMISSIONERS NEXT PROPOSED THAT THE TWO KINGS SHOULD HAVE AN INTERVIEW AT NEWCASTLE IN ORDER TO ADJUST ALL DIFFERENCES BUT JAMES SAID
HAD SOON AFTER ENTIRELY ESCAPED HER MEMORY THE SILLY PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE STRUCK WITH THESE APPEARANCES WHICH THEY IMAGINED TO BE SUPERNATURAL AND RICHARD MASTERS
AND SUBDUED THE DUCHY OF MILAN
AND HENRY BESIDES REMITTING THEM SOME MONEY SENT FOX BISHOP OF HEREFORD AS FRANCIS DID BELLAY LORD OF LANGLEY TO TREAT WITH THEM
MOUNTED TO THE ASSAULT WITH THE UTMOST VALOR AND ENTERING THE CITY SWORD IN HAND EXERCISED ALL THOSE BRUTALITIES WHICH MAY BE EXPECTED FROM FEROCITY EXCITED BY RESISTANCE AND FROM INSOLENCE WHICH TAKES PLACE WHEN THAT RESISTANCE IS NO MORE
HE WOULD ONLY ALLOW A COPY OF IT TO BE DEPOSITED IN SOME PARISH CHURCHES WHERE IT WAS FIXED BY A CHAIN AND HE TOOK CARE TO INFORM THE PEOPLE BY PROCLAMATION THAT THIS INDULGENCE WAS NOT THE EFFECT OF HIS DUTY
WHICH THE INIQUITIES AND SEVERITIES OF HIS REIGN RENDERED A VERY DISMAL PROSPECT TO HIM TO ALLAY THE TERRORS UNDER WHICH HE LABORED
NOT TO SUFFER THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO LANGUISH HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE EXETER AND BY MANY FAIR PROMISES INVITED THAT CITY TO JOIN HIM FINDING THAT THE INHABITANTS SHUT THEIR GATES AGAINST HIM
AND HAVING GIVEN HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ELIZABETH'S REVELATIONS HE SO FAR WROUGHT ON THAT PRUDENT BUT SUPERSTITIOUS PRELATE AS TO RECEIVE ORDERS FROM HIM TO WATCH HER IN HER TRANCES AND CAREFULLY TO NOTE DOWN ALL HER FUTURE SAYINGS
THEY SEEMED DESIROUS OF REVENGING THEMSELVES BY THEIR INSULTS FOR THE SHAME WHICH THEIR FORMER BELIEF OF HIS IMPOSTURES HAD THROWN UPON THEM
TO THE OPPRESSION OF THE INNOCENT AND THE FORMIDABLE AUTHORITY OF THE KING SUPPORTED THEM IN ALL THEIR INIQUITIES IT WAS THEIR USUAL PRACTICE AT FIRST
WHICH HAD BEEN EXACTED OF HIM FOR THE RECOVERY OF HIS LIBERTY IT WAS ALSO FORESEEN THAT THE EMULATION AND RIVALSHIP WHICH HAD SO LONG SUBSISTED BETWEEN THESE TWO MONARCHS WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL THE STRONGEST RELUCTANCE ON YIELDING THE SUPERIORITY TO AN ANTAGONIST WHO
A SOLID PEACE WITH HENRY PRIVATELY DESIRED HIM TO DEPART THE KINGDOM
NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR RAGE AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION THEY CAREFULLY FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN THEM BY THEIR LEADERS AND AS THEY MET WITH NO RESISTANCE THEY COMMITTED DURING THEIR MARCH NO VIOLENCE OR DISORDER
BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM STOP THE RAPACIOUS HAND OF THOSE OPPRESSORS SIR WILLIAM CAPEL WAS AGAIN FINED TWO THOUSAND POUNDS UNDER SOME FRIVOLOUS PRETENCE AND WAS COMMITTED TO THE TOWER FOR DARING TO MURMUR AGAINST THE INIQUITY
RIGIDLY PUT IN EXECUTION AGAINST ALL MEN SPIES INFORMERS AND INQUISITORS WERE REWARDED AND ENCOURAGED IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE KINGDOM AND NO DIFFERENCE WAS MADE WHETHER THE STATUTE WERE BENEFICIAL OR HURTFUL
VIRTUES WHICH HE POSSESSED IN AS EMINENT A DEGREE AS THOSE TIMES EQUALLY DISTRACTED WITH FACTION AND OPPRESSED BY TYRANNY COULD EASILY PERMIT ON THE OTHER HAND
HIS USUAL RETREAT IN ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS THE FLEMISH MERCHANTS WHO SEVERELY FELT THE LOSS RESULTING FROM THE INTERRUPTION OF COMMERCE WITH ENGLAND
IMPATIENT HOWEVER OF A RETREAT WHICH WAS BOTH DISAGREEABLE AND DANGEROUS HE HELD CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS FOLLOWERS HERNE SKELTON AND ASTLEY THREE BROKEN TRADESMEN
THESE MEN EMPLOYED THEMSELVES IN WRITING ENGLISH BOOKS AGAINST THE CORRUPTIONS OF THE CHURCH OF ROME AGAINST IMAGES RELICS PILGRIMAGES AND THEY EXCITED THE CURIOSITY OF MEN WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THEOLOGY
OR PURCHASE LIBERTY BY EXORBITANT RANSOMS CLEMENT HIMSELF WHO HAD TRUSTED FOR PROTECTION TO THE SACREDNESS OF HIS CHARACTER AND NEGLECTED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE IN TIME WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE
LUTHER ALSO HAD BEEN SO IMPRUDENT AS TO TREAT IN A VERY INDECENT MANNER HIS ROYAL ANTAGONIST AND THOUGH HE AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST HUMBLE SUBMISSIONS TO HENRY AND APOLOGIZED FOR THE VEHEMENCE OF HIS FORMER EXPRESSIONS
WERE THE ZEALOUS ADHERENTS TO THE ANCIENT RELIGION CHIEFLY THE MONKS WHO HAVING THEIR IMMEDIATE DEPENDENCE ON THE ROMAN PONTIFF APPREHENDED THEIR OWN RUIN TO BE THE CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE OF ABOLISHING HIS AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND PEYTO
COURTNEY WAS ATTAINTED AND THOUGH NOT EXECUTED HE RECOVERED NOT HIS LIBERTY DURING THE KING'S LIFETIME
ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN PRINCES BOTH IN WAR AND NEGOTIATION WERE TURNED TO THE SIDE OF ITALY
THE STRICT LAW WHICH IN SUCH CASES ALLOWS FORFEITURE OF GOODS WAS RIGOROUSLY INSISTED ON NAY
WHILE THEY OPPOSED TO THE PREJUDICES OF ANCIENT AUTHORITY MORE POWERFUL PREJUDICES OF ANOTHER KIND THE NOVELTY ITSELF OF THE DOCTRINES THE PLEASURE OF AN IMAGINARY TRIUMPH IN DISPUTE THE FERVENT ZEAL OF THE REFORMED PREACHERS
BUT HENRY WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRESCRIBE NOT TO RECEIVE TERMS AND EVEN WHILE HE WAS NEGOTIATING FOR PEACE HIS USUAL VIOLENCE OFTEN CARRIED HIM TO COMMIT OFFENCES WHICH RENDERED THE QUARREL TOTALLY INCURABLE
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU GIRLS DANCING OUT HERE BY YOURSELVES WHEN THERE'S A ROOMFUL OF LONESOME MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR FRIENDS TINY THE GIRLS STILL LAUGHING WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE TINY LOOKED ALARMED
IN MID OCEAN SHE PROCEEDED TO HAVE NOT ONE BABY BUT THREE THIS EVENT MADE FUCHS THE OBJECT OF UNDESERVED NOTORIETY SINCE HE WAS TRAVELING WITH HER THE STEERAGE STEWARDESS WAS INDIGNANT WITH HIM THE DOCTOR REGARDED HIM WITH SUSPICION
THERE'S SOMETHING MIGHTY QUEER ABOUT IT NOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN JAKE GRANDMOTHER ASKED SHARPLY
THE TREE TOPS THAT HAD BEEN GOLD ALL THE AUTUMN WERE DWARFED AND TWISTED AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY LIFE IN THEM AGAIN THE FEW LITTLE CEDARS WHICH WERE SO DULL AND DINGY BEFORE NOW STOOD OUT A STRONG DUSKY GREEN
SUCH A FAN SUCH JEWELS AND HER FACE ONE KNEW AT A GLANCE HOW IT WAS WITH HER WHEN ARMAND WITH THE TERRIBLE WORDS LOOK ALL OF YOU I OWE THIS WOMAN NOTHING
I WATCHED THEM GO PAST THE POND AND OVER THE HILL BY THE DRIFTED CORNFIELD THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THAT I WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE I FELT A CONSIDERABLE EXTENSION OF POWER AND AUTHORITY
WAS WET THROUGH BY THE TIME THAT MORIBUND WOMAN SANK FOR THE LAST TIME INTO THE ARMS OF HER LOVER WHEN WE REACHED THE DOOR OF THE THEATER THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN I HAD PRUDENTLY BROUGHT ALONG MISSUS HARLING'S USEFUL COMMENCEMENT PRESENT
THE WAY HE ACTED AND THE WAY HIS AXE FIT THE WOUND WAS ENOUGH TO CONVICT ANY MAN
TWO SWEDES HAD FELL OUT OF THAT BUCKET ONCE AND HIT THE WATER FEET DOWN
IF I LOSE THAT HORSE MISTER BURDEN ANTONIA EXCLAIMED I NEVER STAY HERE TILL AMBROSCH COME HOME I GO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POND BEFORE MORNING
ONE MORNING HE TOLD US THAT THE SMALL GRAIN WAS COMING ON SO WELL HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BEGIN TO CUT HIS WHEAT ON THE FIRST OF JULY HE WOULD NEED MORE MEN AND IF IT WERE AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE HE WOULD ENGAGE AMBROSCH FOR THE REAPING AND THRASHING AS THE SHIMERDAS HAD NO SMALL GRAIN OF THEIR OWN
THAN FROM ANY EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN HIS ZEST IN DEBAUCHERY MIGHT WANE BUT NEVER MISSUS CUTTER'S BELIEF IN IT THE RECKONING WITH HIS WIFE AT THE END OF AN ESCAPADE WAS SOMETHING HE COUNTED ON
WHEN I GOT UP ON ONE OF THE STOOLS AND PEERED INTO IT I SAW SOME QUILTS AND A PILE OF STRAW THE OLD MAN HELD THE LANTERN YULKA HE SAID IN A LOW DESPAIRING VOICE YULKA MY ANTONIA GRANDMOTHER DREW BACK
OFF ACROSS THE POND IN THE DRAW HEAD AMBROSCH WAS UP ON THE WINDMILL TOWER OILING THE WHEEL HE CAME DOWN NOT VERY CORDIALLY WHEN JAKE ASKED FOR THE COLLAR HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
AND WHO HAVE HAD ADVANTAGES NEVER SEEM TO ME WHEN I MEET THEM NOW HALF AS INTERESTING OR AS WELL EDUCATED THE OLDER GIRLS WHO HELPED TO BREAK UP THE WILD SOD LEARNED SO MUCH FROM LIFE FROM POVERTY FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
BETWEEN THE ACTS WE HAD NO TIME TO FORGET THE ORCHESTRA KEPT SAWING AWAY AT THE TRAVIATA MUSIC SO JOYOUS AND SAD SO THIN AND FAR AWAY SO CLAP TRAP AND YET SO HEART BREAKING
YET PEOPLE SAW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND THE THREE MARYS THEY WERE ALL BOHEMIANS ALL HIRED GIRLS I ALWAYS KNEW I SHOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MY COUNTRY GIRLS COME INTO THEIR OWN AND I HAVE
MISTER CUTTER SHOWED HIS WIFE'S TICKET TO THE CONDUCTOR AND SETTLED HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE THE TRAIN MOVED OFF
ONE COULD EXPERIENCE EXCESS AND SATIETY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF LEARNING WHAT TO DO WITH ONE'S HANDS IN A DRAWING ROOM WHEN THE CHARACTERS ALL SPOKE AT ONCE AND I MISSED SOME OF THE PHRASES THEY FLASHED AT EACH OTHER I WAS IN MISERY
AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
GRANDMOTHER WAS APPREHENSIVE AT ONCE I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU TO STAY THERE FEELING THAT WAY I SUPPOSE IT WOULD N'T BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE PLACE ALONE EITHER
OVER THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO DRAW THE DANCE MUSIC OUT OF IT WHILE THE PERSPIRATION SHONE ON HIS SHORT WOOL AND ON HIS UPLIFTED FACE
AND PRESENTED IT CEREMONIOUSLY TO GRANDMOTHER FOR COOK SHE ANNOUNCED LITTLE NOW BE VERY MUCH WHEN COOK SPREADING OUT HER HANDS AS IF TO INDICATE THAT THE PINT WOULD SWELL TO A GALLON
HE WISHED GRANDMOTHER TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT HE STILL HAD SOME MONEY IF THEY COULD GET THROUGH UNTIL SPRING CAME THEY WOULD BUY A COW AND CHICKENS AND PLANT A GARDEN AND WOULD THEN DO VERY WELL
NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME I'M TO MEET SOME SWEDES AT THE DRUG STORE YOU WOULD N'T CARE FOR THEM I WANTED TO SEE YOUR ROOM SO I COULD WRITE TONY ALL ABOUT IT BUT I MUST TELL HER HOW I LEFT YOU RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR BOOKS SHE'S ALWAYS SO AFRAID SOME ONE WILL RUN OFF WITH YOU
SURE ENOUGH WHERE WOULD YOU SLEEP DEAR I DON'T DOUBT YOU'RE WARM THERE
DETERMINED TO HELP IN THE STRUGGLE TO CLEAR THE HOMESTEAD FROM DEBT THEY HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GO INTO SERVICE SOME OF THEM AFTER THEY CAME TO TOWN REMAINED AS SERIOUS AND AS DISCREET IN BEHAVIOR
THEN IF MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS INCLINED TO MAKE TROUBLE HER SON WAS STILL UNDER AGE SHE WOULD BE FORESTALLED
IT WAS COLD AND HARD AND LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN HIS BLACK UNIVERSE HE WENT BACK TO ITS MOUTH BEGAN AT ONE END OF THE KEYBOARD AND FELT HIS WAY DOWN INTO THE MELLOW THUNDER AS FAR AS HE COULD GO
OUR HEAVY CARPENTER'S BENCH HAD TO BE BROUGHT FROM THE BARN AND CARRIED DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN FUCHS SELECTED BOARDS FROM A PILE OF PLANKS GRANDFATHER HAD HAULED OUT FROM TOWN IN THE FALL TO MAKE A NEW FLOOR FOR THE OATS BIN WHEN AT LAST THE LUMBER AND TOOLS WERE ASSEMBLED
HOW I LOVED TO HEAR HER LAUGH AGAIN IT WAS SO SOFT AND UNEXCITED AND APPRECIATIVE GAVE A FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION TO EVERYTHING WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES I COULD HEAR THEM ALL LAUGHING
I THINK I'D BETTER GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER ANTONIA I SAID I THINK YOU HAD
INDEED HE WAS NEVER THE SAME HORSE AFTERWARD
THEY HAD FOUR COMFORTABLE ROOMS TO LIVE IN A NEW WINDMILL BOUGHT ON CREDIT A CHICKEN HOUSE AND POULTRY MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD PAID GRANDFATHER TEN DOLLARS FOR A MILK COW AND WAS TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN MORE AS SOON AS THEY HARVESTED THEIR FIRST CROP
LAUGH UNTIL SHE WIPED HER EYES WITH HER BARE ARM HER HANDS BEING FLOURY IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN OTTO LEFT AUSTRIA TO COME TO AMERICA HE WAS ASKED BY ONE OF HIS RELATIVES TO LOOK AFTER A WOMAN WHO WAS CROSSING ON THE SAME BOAT
AFTER I BEGAN TO GO TO THE COUNTRY SCHOOL I SAW LESS OF THE BOHEMIANS WE WERE SIXTEEN PUPILS AT THE SOD SCHOOLHOUSE AND WE ALL CAME ON HORSEBACK AND BROUGHT OUR DINNER MY SCHOOLMATES WERE NONE OF THEM VERY INTERESTING BUT I SOMEHOW FELT THAT BY MAKING COMRADES OF THEM
OH WE'LL MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH MOLLY GET YOUR BACK UP JOHNNIE MOLLY WAS MISSUS GARDENER'S NAME OF COURSE
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS TALKED DEAR WOMAN TO HERSELF OR TO THE LORD IF THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO LISTEN BUT GRANDFATHER WAS NATURALLY TACITURN
AND WAS ANXIOUS TO ACQUIT MYSELF CREDITABLY I CARRIED IN COBS AND WOOD FROM THE LONG CELLAR AND FILLED BOTH THE STOVES I REMEMBERED THAT IN THE HURRY AND EXCITEMENT OF THE MORNING NOBODY HAD THOUGHT OF THE CHICKENS AND THE EGGS HAD NOT BEEN GATHERED
THEY MISTOOK THE METTLE OF THEIR SONS THE RESPECT FOR RESPECTABILITY WAS STRONGER THAN ANY DESIRE IN BLACK HAWK YOUTH OUR YOUNG MAN OF POSITION WAS LIKE THE SON OF A ROYAL HOUSE THE BOY WHO SWEPT OUT HIS OFFICE
THOUGH IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHER CHILDREN ONE DAY SAMSON WAS STANDING THUS WHILE MISS NELLIE WAS PLAYING HER LESSON TO HER MUSIC MASTER THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN
DON'T BE MAD I KNOW IT'S AWFUL HARD WORK FOR BREAK SOD I MILK THE COW FOR YOU TO MORROW IF YOU WANT MISSUS SHIMERDA TURNED QUICKLY TO ME THAT COW NOT GIVE SO MUCH MILK LIKE WHAT YOUR GRANDPA SAY
HE SAY I BREAK HIS SAW WHEN WE BUILD AND I NEVER GRUMBLED AMBROSCH I KNEW HE HAD BROKEN THE SAW AND THEN HID IT AND LIED ABOUT IT I BEGAN TO WISH I HAD NOT STAYED FOR SUPPER EVERYTHING WAS DISAGREEABLE TO ME
SHE STARTED AND CLUTCHED THE ROPE TIGHTER SEEING THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND GRANDFATHER TURNED BACK YOU NEED NOT PAY ME ANYTHING MORE NO MORE MONEY THE COW IS YOURS PAY NO MORE
SEVERAL TEACHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH HIM THEY FOUND HE HAD ABSOLUTE PITCH AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD HE COULD REPEAT AFTER A FASHION ANY COMPOSITION THAT WAS PLAYED FOR HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WRONG NOTES HE STRUCK HE NEVER LOST THE INTENTION OF A PASSAGE
ANTONIA STOOD UP LIFTING AND DROPPING HER SHOULDERS AS IF THEY WERE STIFF I AIN'T GOT TIME TO LEARN I CAN WORK LIKE MANS NOW MY MOTHER CAN'T SAY NO MORE HOW AMBROSCH DO ALL AND NOBODY TO HELP HIM I CAN WORK AS MUCH AS HIM
AND WHENEVER WE STOPPED HE SMOKED ALL OVER THE CORNFIELDS GOT BACK A LITTLE OF THEIR COLOR UNDER THE DAZZLING LIGHT AND STOOD THE PALEST POSSIBLE GOLD IN THE SUN AND SNOW ALL ABOUT US THE SNOW WAS CRUSTED IN SHALLOW TERRACES
I WAS LEFT WITH AMBROSCH I SAW A SIDE OF HIM I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE HE WAS DEEPLY EVEN SLAVISHLY DEVOUT HE DID NOT SAY A WORD ALL MORNING BUT SAT WITH HIS ROSARY IN HIS HANDS PRAYING NOW SILENTLY NOW ALOUD
WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
HE TRAMPED OUT THROUGH THE LONG CELLAR AND DROPPED THE HEAVY DOOR BEHIND HIM AFTER BREAKFAST GRANDMOTHER AND JAKE AND I BUNDLED OURSELVES UP AND CLIMBED INTO THE COLD FRONT WAGON SEAT AS WE APPROACHED THE SHIMERDAS WE HEARD THE FROSTY WHINE OF THE PUMP
WHEN I GOT HOME I CLIMBED IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW I WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM MY NOSE AND LIP BUT I WAS TOO SICK TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I FOUND A SHAWL AND AN OVERCOAT ON THE HATRACK LAY DOWN ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND IN SPITE OF MY HURTS WENT TO SLEEP
SHE PROTESTED SHE'D BE AWFUL MAD IF YOU WAS TO COME OUT HERE AND DANCE WITH US MISSUS GARDENER'S IN OMAHA GIRL
WINTER LIES TOO LONG IN COUNTRY TOWNS HANGS ON UNTIL IT IS STALE AND SHABBY OLD AND SULLEN ON THE FARM THE WEATHER WAS THE GREAT FACT AND MEN'S AFFAIRS WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT AS THE STREAMS CREEP UNDER THE ICE
THIS IS NO TIME TO BE OVER CONSIDERATE OF ANIMALS OTTO DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR YOURSELF
AS IF SHE WERE SUMMONING HIM TO THE BAR OF JUDGMENT BUT THE LINES WERE ENOUGH SHE HAD ONLY TO UTTER THEM THEY CREATED THE CHARACTER IN SPITE OF HER THE HEARTLESS WORLD WHICH MARGUERITE RE ENTERED WITH VARVILLE
THIS WAS NOT A BOAST BUT A HOPE AT ONCE BOLD AND DEVOUTLY HUMBLE THAT HE MIGHT BRING THE MUSE BUT LATELY COME TO ITALY FROM HER CLOUDY GRECIAN MOUNTAINS NOT TO THE CAPITAL THE PALATIA ROMANA
CROUCHING OVER AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO HIDE FROM US YULKA WAS ON THE FLOOR AT HIS FEET HER KITTEN IN HER LAP SHE PEEPED OUT AT ME AND SMILED BUT GLANCING UP AT HER MOTHER HID AGAIN
OLD MISTER SHIMERDA IS DEAD AND HIS FAMILY ARE IN GREAT DISTRESS AMBROSCH CAME OVER HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND JAKE AND OTTO WENT BACK WITH HIM THE BOYS HAVE HAD A HARD NIGHT AND YOU MUST NOT BOTHER THEM WITH QUESTIONS
SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD STARTED HOME FROM OMAHA TOGETHER THE MORNING BEFORE THEY HAD TO STOP OVER SEVERAL HOURS AT WAYMORE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN
AT DINNER GRANDFATHER TALKED TO JELINEK MORE THAN HE USUALLY DID TO STRANGERS WILL THEY BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET A PRIEST HE ASKED JELINEK LOOKED SERIOUS
OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
IT WAS FULL OF LITTLE BROWN CHIPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THE SHAVINGS OF SOME ROOT THEY WERE AS LIGHT AS FEATHERS AND THE MOST NOTICEABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR PENETRATING EARTHY ODOR WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE THEY MIGHT BE DRIED MEAT FROM SOME QUEER BEAST JIM
IT'S A GOOD THING THE HARLINGS ARE FRIENDLY WITH HER AGAIN LARRY'S AFRAID OF THEM THEY SHIP SO MUCH GRAIN THEY HAVE INFLUENCE WITH THE RAILROAD PEOPLE WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING SHE LEANED HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND DREW MY BOOK TOWARD HER
THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOCIAL SITUATION IN BLACK HAWK ALL THE YOUNG MEN FELT THE ATTRACTION OF THE FINE WELL SET UP COUNTRY GIRLS WHO HAD COME TO TOWN TO EARN A LIVING AND IN NEARLY EVERY CASE TO HELP THE FATHER STRUGGLE OUT OF DEBT
I DID NOT OF COURSE SAY THAT I BELIEVED HE HAD BEEN IN THAT VERY KITCHEN ALL AFTERNOON ON HIS WAY BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY NEVERTHELESS AFTER I WENT TO BED THIS IDEA OF PUNISHMENT AND PURGATORY CAME BACK ON ME CRUSHINGLY
DISAPPEARED ON THE SECOND ROUND THEY TALKED EXCITEDLY ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD BURY MISTER SHIMERDA I GATHERED THAT THE NEIGHBORS WERE ALL DISTURBED AND SHOCKED ABOUT SOMETHING IT DEVELOPED THAT MISSUS SHIMERDA AND AMBROSCH WANTED THE OLD MAN BURIED ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THEIR OWN LAND
HE SHAVED AFTER DINNER AND WASHED HISSELF ALL OVER AFTER THE GIRLS WAS DONE THE DISHES ANTONIA HEATED THE WATER FOR HIM THEN HE PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT AND CLEAN SOCKS AND AFTER HE WAS DRESSED HE KISSED HER AND THE LITTLE ONE
THE ROOM WAS INVADED BY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AND DASHING YOUNG MEN LAUGHING AND TALKING TOGETHER THE MEN WERE DRESSED MORE OR LESS AFTER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN THE WOMEN WERE NOT I SAW NO INCONSISTENCY
WELL I CAN TAKE THEM SOME VICTUALS ANYWAY AND SAY A WORD OF COMFORT TO THEM POOR LITTLE GIRLS THE OLDEST ONE WAS HIS DARLING AND WAS LIKE A RIGHT HAND TO HIM HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF HER HE'S LEFT HER ALONE IN A HARD WORLD
OTTO PRETENDED NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANTONIA'S BEHAVIOR HE ONLY LIFTED HIS BROWS AND SAID YOU CAN'T TELL ME ANYTHING NEW ABOUT A CZECH I'M AN AUSTRIAN GRANDFATHER WAS NEVER A PARTY TO WHAT JAKE CALLED OUR FEUD WITH THE SHIMERDAS
SAT DEMURELY ON HER YELLOW HAIR I LED HER TOWARD CLERIC'S CHAIR THE ONLY COMFORTABLE ONE I HAD QUESTIONING HER CONFUSEDLY SHE WAS NOT DISCONCERTED BY MY EMBARRASSMENT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH THE NAIVE CURIOSITY I REMEMBERED SO WELL
ON MONDAY ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER JAKE HAD STARTED WE SAW MISSUS SHIMERDA AND HER AMBROSCH PROUDLY DRIVING BY LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR LEFT AS THEY RATTLED OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE BLACK HAWK ROAD
GRANDMOTHER MOVED ABOUT QUIETLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HIM AT LAST HE FOLDED HIS RULER AND TURNED A CHEERFUL FACE TO US
HIS YELLOW FACE WAS LIFTED IN THE LIGHT WITH A SHOW OF WHITE TEETH ALL GRINNING AND HIS SHRUNKEN PAPERY EYELIDS LAY MOTIONLESS OVER HIS BLIND EYES GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN NO LADIES HERE GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN
WHEN HE WAS SITTING OR STANDING STILL HE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH INCESSANTLY LIKE A ROCKING TOY AT THE PIANO HE SWAYED IN TIME TO THE MUSIC AND WHEN HE WAS NOT PLAYING HIS BODY KEPT UP THIS MOTION LIKE AN EMPTY MILL GRINDING ON
WE WAS SNOWED IN THEN LIKE WE ARE NOW AND I HAPPENED TO BE THE ONLY MAN IN CAMP THAT COULD MAKE A COFFIN FOR HIM IT'S A HANDY THING TO KNOW WHEN YOU KNOCK ABOUT LIKE I'VE DONE
THERE STOOD MISSUS CUTTER LOCKED OUT FOR SHE HAD NO KEY TO THE NEW LOCK HER HEAD TREMBLING WITH RAGE I ADVISED HER TO CONTROL HERSELF OR SHE WOULD HAVE A STROKE GRANDMOTHER SAID AFTERWARDS
THE DANISH LAUNDRY GIRLS AND THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS LENA HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL BACK TO ME IT CAME OVER ME AS IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE THE RELATION BETWEEN GIRLS LIKE THOSE AND THE POETRY OF VIRGIL
NOR LIFTED HIS EYES AS HE CEREMONIOUSLY TIPPED HIS HAT WHEN HE HAPPENED TO MEET HER ON THE SIDEWALK SO THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE LIKE I THOUGHT THESE WHITE HANDED HIGH COLLARED CLERKS AND BOOKKEEPERS
WHEN ONE DANCED WITH THEM THEIR BODIES NEVER MOVED INSIDE THEIR CLOTHES THEIR MUSCLES SEEMED TO ASK BUT ONE THING NOT TO BE DISTURBED I REMEMBER THOSE GIRLS MERELY AS FACES IN THE SCHOOLROOM GAY AND ROSY OR LISTLESS AND DULL
SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH I WAS TOO FAINT AND MISERABLE TO GO INTO EXPLANATIONS WHEN SHE TOOK
SHE BORE HARD ON THE IDEA AND ON THE CONSONANTS AT ALL TIMES SHE WAS HIGHLY TRAGIC DEVOURED BY REMORSE LIGHTNESS OF STRESS OR BEHAVIOR WAS FAR FROM HER HER VOICE WAS HEAVY AND DEEP
FUCHS BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM A STRANGER A YOUNG BOHEMIAN WHO HAD TAKEN A HOMESTEAD NEAR BLACK HAWK AND WHO CAME ON HIS ONLY HORSE TO HELP HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN IN THEIR TROUBLE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW ANTON JELINEK
WOULD YOU LIKE TO I'D BE EVER SO PLEASED I'M NEVER BUSY AFTER SIX O'CLOCK AND I LET MY SEWING GIRLS GO AT HALF PAST FIVE I BOARD TO SAVE TIME BUT SOMETIMES I COOK A CHOP FOR MYSELF AND I'D BE GLAD TO COOK ONE FOR YOU WELL
GOOD MORNING MISSUS SHIMERDA CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I WILL FIND AMBROSCH WHICH FIELD HE WITH THE SOD CORN SHE POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH STILL STANDING IN FRONT OF THE COW AS IF SHE HOPED TO CONCEAL IT
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BLUE MORNING THE BUFFALO PEAS WERE BLOOMING IN PINK AND PURPLE MASSES ALONG THE ROADSIDE AND THE LARKS PERCHED ON LAST YEAR'S DRIED SUNFLOWER STALKS WERE SINGING STRAIGHT AT THE SUN THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR YELLOW BREASTS A QUIVER
THEY AIN'T TO BE TRUSTED I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET TOO THICK WITH ANY OF EM
THE SHIMERDAS WERE IN THEIR NEW LOG HOUSE BY THEN THE NEIGHBORS HAD HELPED THEM TO BUILD IT IN MARCH IT STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR OLD CAVE WHICH THEY USED AS A CELLAR THE FAMILY WERE NOW FAIRLY EQUIPPED TO BEGIN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE SOIL
I DON'T KNOW WHICH I ENVY HIM MOST SAID MACCHIAVELLI THE OFFENCE OR THE PUNISHMENT THE OFFENCE WILL MAKE HIM THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN ALL FLORENCE AND THE PUNISHMENT WILL TAKE HIM AMONG THE ONLY PEOPLE IN ITALY WHO HAVE KNOWN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
DARTED OFF ACROSS THE PIAZZA WITH THE MONKEY CLUTCHING GRINNING AND BLINKING ON HIS NECK IL CAVALLO IL DIAVOLO WAS NOW SHOUTED ON ALL SIDES BY THE IDLE RASCALS WHO GATHERED FROM ALL QUARTERS OF THE PIAZZA
ATTRACTING THE EARS OF CURIOSITY AND MALICE AS WELL AS OF FAITH THE MEN OF IDEAS LIKE YOUNG NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI WENT TO OBSERVE AND WRITE REPORTS TO FRIENDS AWAY IN COUNTRY VILLAS THE MEN OF APPETITES LIKE DOLFO SPINI
WERE REASONS WHY THE PREACHING IN THE DUOMO COULD LEAST OF ALL BE DISPENSED WITH BUT NOT ALL THE FEET IN THE PIAZZA WERE HASTENING TOWARDS THE STEPS PEOPLE OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE WERE MOVING TO AND FRO WITH THE BRISK PACE OF MEN WHO HAD ERRANDS BEFORE THEM
SAID NELLO YOU COULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT WITH THAT DARK RUST ON YOUR CHIN ECCO MESSER DOMENICO I AM READY FOR YOU NOW BY THE WAY MY BEL ERUDITO CONTINUED NELLO AS HE SAW TITO MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR
STONES WITH PATCHES OF RARE COLOURED LICHEN SKULLS AND BONES PEACOCKS FEATHERS AND LARGE BIRDS WINGS RISING FROM AMONGST THE DIRTY LITTER OF THE FLOOR WERE LAY FIGURES ONE IN THE FROCK OF A VALLOMBROSAN MONK STRANGELY SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET WITH BARRED VISOR
THE DOOR WAS A LITTLE BEHIND TESSA
AND HERE IS A PASTE WHICH IS EVEN OF SAVOURY ODOUR AND IS INFALLIBLE AGAINST MELANCHOLIA BEING CONCOCTED UNDER THE CONJUNCTION OF JUPITER AND VENUS AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALLAY SPASMS STAY MAESTRO SAID NELLO
THAT PAGOLANTONIO SODERINI HAS GIVEN SER PIERO DA BIBBIENA A BOX ON THE EAR FOR SETTING ON PIERO DE MEDICI
ROMOLA DISCERNED A WISH IN THIS INTIMATION AND IMMEDIATELY ASSENTED BUT PRESENTLY COMING BACK IN HER HOOD AND MANTLE SHE SAID OH WHAT A LONG BREATH FLORENCE WILL TAKE WHEN THE GATES ARE FLUNG OPEN AND THE LAST FRENCHMAN IS WALKING OUT OF THEM
GOOD BYE TESSA KINDEST WISHES TITO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE SILLY LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE CERRETANO SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR HIMSELF AND PEOPLE ARE APT TO THINK THAT RESOLUTIONS TAKEN ON THEIR OWN BEHALF WILL BE FIRM AS FOR THE FIFTY FIVE FLORINS THE PURCHASE MONEY OF THE RING
THAT THERE WAS AN OFFENCE ABOUT WHICH NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SPEAK THE NEXT DAY TITO REMAINED AWAY FROM HOME UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT
IT DID JUST CROSS HIS MIND THAT IF AFTER ALL FORTUNE BY ONE OF HER ABLE DEVICES SAVED HIM FROM THE NECESSITY OF QUITTING FLORENCE
WE SHALL SEE ARMS ARE GOOD AND FLORENCE IS LIKELY TO WANT THEM THE FRATE TELLS US WE SHALL GET PISA AGAIN AND I HOLD WITH THE FRATE BUT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW HOW THE PROMISE IS TO BE FULFILLED IF WE DON'T GET PLENTY OF GOOD WEAPONS FORGED THE FRATE SEES A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM THAT I BELIEVE
BUT HAVE YOU THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE COAT FOR YOU'VE PASSED MY SHOP OFTEN ENOUGH TO KNOW MY SIGN YOU'VE SEEN THE BURNING ACCOUNT BOOKS
ATTEMPTS AT POETIC FIGURES WHICH ARE MANIFEST SOLECISMS THAT MOMENT HAD COME TO POLITIAN THE SECRETARY HAD PUT FORTH HIS SOFT HEAD FROM THE OFFICIAL SHELL AND THE TERRIBLE LURKING CRAB WAS DOWN UPON HIM POLITIAN HAD USED THE FREEDOM OF A FRIEND
AND WAS ECHOED IN TONES OF ALARM BY THE STALL KEEPERS WHOSE VESTED INTERESTS SEEMED IN SOME DANGER WHILE THE DOCTOR OUT OF HIS WITS WITH CONFUSED TERROR AT THE DEVIL THE POSSIBLE STONING AND THE ESCAPE OF HIS HORSE
WHAT ARE A HANDFUL OF REASONABLE MEN AGAINST A CROWD WITH STONES IN THEIR HANDS THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US WHO THINK CECCO D'ASCOLI WAS AN INNOCENT SAGE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW HE WAS BURNT ALIVE FOR BEING WISER THAN HIS FELLOWS
AND MAESTRO TACCO ADVANCED AND SEATED HIMSELF UNDER A PREOCCUPATION WITH HIS HEAT AND HIS SELF IMPORTANCE WHICH MADE HIM QUITE DEAF TO THE IRONY CONVEYED IN NELLO'S OFFICIOUSLY POLITE SPEECH
WE FEEL NO DOUBT THEN WHAT IS THE HIGHEST PRIZE THE SOUL CAN WIN WE ALMOST BELIEVE IN OUR OWN POWER TO ATTAIN IT BY A NEW CURRENT OF SUCH ENTHUSIASM ROMOLA WAS HELPED THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT SUMMER DAYS
AN AGENCY INDUCED BY MOTIVES ABOUT WHICH HE WAS VERY FRANK DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THEIR EFFORTS FUTILE AND THAT HE SINCERELY PREFERRED THE MAINTENANCE OF THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT AFFECTED TO CONFIDE TO VALORI AS A SECRET HIS OWN PERSONAL DISLIKE FOR BERNARDO DEL NERO
SO THAT MEN COULD WALK ALONG NO LESS SECURELY AND COMMODIOUSLY THAN BY DAY FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA ALONG THOSE ILLUMINATED STREETS TITO MELEMA WAS WALKING AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARD
AND SEEING A GREAT FLAT STONE AGAINST A CYPRESS THAT ROSE FROM A PROJECTING GREEN BANK SHE YIELDED TO THE DESIRE WHICH THE SLIGHT SHOCK HAD GIVEN HER TO SIT DOWN AND REST
AND KEPT HIM FROM RAISING HIS HEAD TO MEET HER EYES THEIR PURE LIGHT BROUGHT TOO NEAR HIM THE PROSPECT OF A COMING STRUGGLE BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE HELPED IF THEY HAD TO LEAVE FLORENCE THEY MUST HAVE MONEY
TWO SLIGHTER EBONY FIGURES ONE AT THE ANVIL THE OTHER AT THE BELLOWS SERVED TO SET OFF HIS SUPERIOR MASSIVENESS
FOR THE DOUBLE DOOR UNDERNEATH THE WINDOW WHICH ADMITTED THE PAINTER'S LIGHT FROM ABOVE WAS THROWN OPEN AND SHOWED A GARDEN OR RATHER THICKET IN WHICH FIG TREES AND VINES GREW IN TANGLED TRAILING WILDNESS AMONG NETTLES AND HEMLOCKS
OR OF LOOKING AT HIM PATIENCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE WILL RECOVER IT AND FORGIVE AT LAST
BUT IT WAS A LIFE THAT SHATTERED HIM IN A FEW MINUTES MORE SOME HAD RISEN TO THEIR FEET BUT A LARGER NUMBER REMAINED KNEELING AND ALL FACES WERE INTENTLY WATCHING HIM
BUT A BRONZED NOSE AND A PAIR OF DARK EYES AND EYEBROWS SHE CARRIED HER CHILD PACKED UP IN THE STIFF MUMMY SHAPED CASE IN WHICH ITALIAN BABIES HAVE BEEN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL INTRODUCED INTO SOCIETY TURNING ITS FACE A LITTLE TOWARDS HER BOSOM
NOWHERE WOULD HE FIND A MORE DEVOUT ADMIRATION OF ANTIQUITY THE SECRETARY WAS ASHAMED OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED AND BLUSHED FOR IT SOME INDEED THERE WERE WHO WANTED TO HAVE THEIR OWN WORKS PRAISED AND EXALTED TO A LEVEL WITH THE DIVINE MONUMENTS OF ANTIQUITY BUT HE SCALA
AS THERE WOULD BE AGENTS COMING TO PACK UP THE ANTIQUITIES THEN LEANING TO KISS HER ON THE BROW
HAD LONG SINCE MADE HIS ORATIONS ON THE RINGHIERA
THE GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE CRISTIANISSIMO I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE TO GO THROUGH SMILING CEREMONIES WITH THESE RUSTLING MAGNATES WHOM WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE AGAIN AND AS THEY WILL WANT TO LOOK AT THE ANTIQUITIES AND THE LIBRARY PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GIVE UP YOUR WORK TO DAY AND GO TO SEE YOUR COUSIN BRIGIDA
OF HER EYES AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT NOTHING BUT THE BRIGHTNESS ON THE PATH AND AT HER OWN SHADOW TALL AND SHROUDED LIKE A DREAD SPECTRE
OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE ORATORICAL WELCOME HAD TURNED OUT RATHER WORSE THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED
THE PRISONER'S SENSATIONS WERE NOT TOO SLOW FOR HIM TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY
WHEN THE STRICKEN PERSON IS SLOW TO RECOVER AND LOOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE STRIKER EASILY GLIDES INTO THE POSITION OF THE AGGRIEVED PARTY HE FEELS NO BRUISE HIMSELF AND IS STRONGLY CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN AMIABLE BEHAVIOUR
THAT CAME AS NATURALLY TO HIM AS WALKING SAID THE FEW NEEDFUL WORDS IN THE NAME OF THE SIGNORIA THEN GAVE WAY GRACEFULLY AND LET THE KING PASS ON HIS PRESENCE OF MIND WHICH HAD FAILED HIM IN THE TERRIBLE CRISIS OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN A READY INSTRUMENT THIS TIME
WHO FOUND HIS LATIN PROSE STYLE ELEGANT AND MASCULINE AND THE TERRIBLE JOSEPH SCALIGER WHO WAS TO PRONOUNCE HIM TOTALLY IGNORANT OF LATINITY WAS AT A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE IN THE NEXT CENTURY
OVERLOOKING THE SPACIOUS GARDENS AND LAWN AT THE BACK OF HIS PALACE HE WAS IN THIS POSITION ON THE DAY WHEN HE HAD GRANTED THE DESIRED INTERVIEW TO TITO MELEMA
BARDO WAS FIERCE YOU CAN'T DENY IT BUT IF YOU HAD ONLY TOLD ME THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG HUSSEY AND CHILDREN I SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL ANYTHING SEEN OR SAID OF HER NO AND THE LESS THE BETTER THEY SAY ENOUGH OF ILL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT THAT
I BEGIN TO THINK YOU ARE A CYNIC PHILOSOPHER IN THE PLEASANT DISGUISE OF A CUNNING PAINTER NOT I MESSER GRECO A PHILOSOPHER IS THE LAST SORT OF ANIMAL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO RESEMBLE I FIND IT ENOUGH TO LIVE WITHOUT SPINNING LIES TO ACCOUNT FOR LIFE
BUT THEY MUST BE SAID OVER A GOOD RAZOR SEE NELLO SAID MACCHIAVELLI WHAT DOCTOR IS THIS ADVANCING ON HIS BUCEPHALUS I THOUGHT YOUR PIAZZA WAS FREE FROM THOSE FURRED AND SCARLET ROBED LACKEYS OF DEATH
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO TITO'S APPOINTED VISIT THAT THE PAPERS CONTAINING THIS CORRESPONDENCE WERE BROUGHT OUT TO DAY HERE WAS A NEW GREEK SCHOLAR WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE TO BE TESTED AND ON NOTHING DID SCALA MORE DESIRE A DISPASSIONATE OPINION FROM PERSONS OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
SINCE HE HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD TO WEAR IT FOR THE SAKE OF PECULIAR MEMORIES AND PREDILECTIONS STILL IT WAS A SLIGHT MATTER NOT WORTH DWELLING ON WITH ANY EMPHASIS AND IN THOSE MOMENTS HE HAD LOST HIS CONFIDENCE IN FORTUNE
BUT NOT SO THE DEBATING INSIDE THE PALACE
WHO HAD BEEN HER CONTEMPT FROM CHILDHOOD TILL NOW
HE HAD CULTIVATED MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER THE REGARD OF THIS PARTY BY SHOWING SUBTLE EVIDENCE THAT HIS POLITICAL CONVICTIONS WERE ENTIRELY ON THEIR SIDE AND ALL THE WHILE
YOU ARE THE SLAVE OF RUDE MORTALS WHO BUT FOR YOU WOULD DIE LIKE BRUTES WITHOUT HELP OF PILL OR POWDER IT IS PITIFUL TO SEE YOUR LEARNED LYMPH OOZING FROM YOUR PORES AS IF IT WERE MERE VULGAR MOISTURE YOU THINK MY SHAVING WILL COOL AND DISENCUMBER YOU
FROM A LITTLE WOMAN NAMED TESSA IS IT NOT TRUE AH IF YOU KNOW HER SAID BRATTI AND WOULD REDEEM IT OF ME AT A SMALL PROFIT AND GIVE IT HER AGAIN YOU'D BE DOING A CHARITY FOR SHE CRIED AT PARTING WITH IT YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS RUNNING INTO A BROOK
HE ADDED LOOKING DOWN INTO TITO'S FACE TITO LAUGHED AND BLUSHED
SAINT MARGARET'S RESURRECTION OUT OF THE DEVOURING DRAGON MADONNAS WITH THE SUPERNAL LIGHT UPON THEM STUDIES OF PLANTS AND GROTESQUE HEADS AND ON IRREGULAR ROUGH SHELVES A FEW BOOKS WERE SCATTERED AMONG GREAT DROOPING BUNCHES OF CORN BULLOCKS HORNS PIECES OF DRIED HONEYCOMB
THAT FORCE WAS THE PREACHING OF SAVONAROLA IMPELLED PARTLY BY THE SPIRITUAL NECESSITY THAT WAS LAID UPON HIM TO GUIDE THE PEOPLE AND PARTLY BY THE PROMPTING OF PUBLIC MEN WHO COULD GET NO MEASURES CARRIED WITHOUT HIS AID
WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT SCALA FOUND THE AGE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM SINCE HE HIMSELF WAS SO DISTASTEFUL TO THE AGE NAY IT WAS WITH PERFECT ACCURACY THAT HE THE ELEGANT SCHOLAR HAD CALLED SCALA A BRANNY MONSTER
HERE BUONA DONNA HERE IS THE FAMOUS DOCTOR WHY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE SWEET BIMBO THIS QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED TO A STURDY LOOKING BROAD SHOULDERED CONTADINA WITH HER HEAD DRAPERY FOLDED ABOUT HER FACE SO THAT LITTLE WAS TO BE SEEN
PROVOKING A RESPONSE OUTWARDLY IN THE DECLARATION THAT AT THE FITTING TIME THE MIRACLE WOULD COME INWARDLY IN THE FAITH NOT UNWAVERING FOR WHAT FAITH IS SO THAT IF THE NEED FOR MIRACLE BECAME URGENT
HALF HUMILIATED EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WITHIN HEARING OF THE JOKE WHICH IS PRODUCING INFECTIOUS LAUGHTER IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL MOMENT FOR TITO FOR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO COULD HAVE MADE SO AMUSING AN INTERPRETER
ON THE WAY TO THE GATE OF SANTA CROCE I AM A PAINTER I WOULD GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET YOUR PORTRAIT THE SUSPICION RETURNED INTO BALDASSARRE'S GLANCE AS HE LOOKED AT PIERO AND SAID DECIDEDLY NO AH SAID THE PAINTER CURTLY WELL GO STRAIGHT ON AND YOU'LL FIND THE PORTA SANTA CROCE
ACCORDING TO THEIR DEGREE AND THERE ARE EVEN REMEDIES KNOWN TO OUR SCIENCE WHICH ARE ENTIRELY FREE OF COST AS THE NEW TUSSIS MAY BE COUNTERACTED IN THE POOR WHO CAN PAY FOR NO SPECIFICS
BENT ON HUNTING DOWN THE FRATE AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE WHO MADE GAME SCARCE WENT TO FEED THEIR HATRED AND LIE IN WAIT FOR GROUNDS OF ACCUSATION PERHAPS WHILE NO PREACHER EVER HAD A MORE MASSIVE INFLUENCE THAN SAVONAROLA
AND SHADOWS WERE THROWN ACROSS THE ROAD IT SEEMED THAT THE SUN WAS GOING TO CHASE AWAY THE GREYNESS THE LIGHT IS PERHAPS NEVER FELT MORE STRONGLY AS A DIVINE PRESENCE
AGAIN HIS MIND RUSHED OVER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM FLORENCE AND HE CONCEIVED A PLAN OF GETTING BACK HIS MONEY FROM CENNINI BEFORE THE DISCLOSURE HAD BECOME PUBLIC IF HE ONCE HAD HIS MONEY
LET ANY SIGNOR APPLY THIS BOX TO HIS NOSTRILS AND HE WILL FIND AN HONEST ODOUR OF MEDICAMENTS NOT INDEED OF POUNDED GEMS OR RARE VEGETABLES FROM THE EAST OR STONES FOUND IN THE BODIES OF BIRDS
IN THE MIDST OF HIS YELLOW BLOODLESS DEEP WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LANK GREY HAIRS AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING FITFUL IN THE EYES WHICH CONTRADICTED THE OCCASIONAL FLASH OF ENERGY AFTER LOOKING ROUND WITH QUICK FIERCENESS AT WINDOWS AND FACES THEY FELL AGAIN WITH A LOST AND WANDERING LOOK
BUT WHEN WAS THE FATAL COQUETRY INHERENT IN SUPERFLUOUS AUTHORSHIP EVER QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE READY PRAISE OF FRIENDS THAT CRITICAL SUPERCILIOUS POLITIAN A FELLOW BROWSER WHO WAS FAR FROM AMIABLE
THEY BROUGHT NO SIGN FROM BALDASSARRE AND IN SPITE OF SPECIAL WATCH ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT NO REVELATION OF THE SUSPECTED CONSPIRACY
SAID BRATTI LOOKING ROUND AT HER VERY DELIBERATELY HIS MIND NOT BEING SUBJECT TO SURPRISE IT'S A NECKLACE WORTH MONEY BUT I SHALL GET LITTLE BY IT FOR MY HEART'S TOO TENDER FOR A TRADER'S I HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP IT IN PLEDGE PRAY TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT
ONLY AS PIERO DE MEDICI IS TO BE THERE THE CHOICE SPIRITS MAY HAPPEN TO BE SWAMPED IN THE CAPPING OF IMPROMPTU VERSES I HATE THAT GAME IT IS A DEVICE FOR THE TRIUMPH OF SMALL WITS WHO ARE ALWAYS INSPIRED THE MOST BY THE SMALLEST OCCASIONS
WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY CHOKED UP AND BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE A MAKESHIFT COURSE THROUGH THE BACK STREETS SO AS TO MEET THE KING AT THE CATHEDRAL ONLY ALSO IF THE YOUNG MONARCH UNDER THE CANOPY SEATED ON HIS CHARGER WITH HIS LANCE UPON HIS THIGH
WALKING ALONG THE VIA SAN GALLO AND LOOKING WATCHFULLY ABOUT HER THROUGH HER LONG WIDOW'S VEIL LEST SHE SHOULD MISS ANY OBJECT THAT MIGHT AID HER SHE DESCRIED BRATTI CHAFFERING WITH A CUSTOMER THAT ROAMING MAN SHE THOUGHT MIGHT AID HER SHE WOULD NOT MIND TALKING OF TESSA TO HIM
THE FRENCH ARE AS READY TO GO FROM FLORENCE AS THE WASPS TO LEAVE A RIPE PEAR WHEN THEY HAVE JUST FASTENED ON IT ROMOLA KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE USUAL RESPONSE TOOK AWAY HER HAND AND SAID I AM GOING TITO
URGED TO A DESPERATE LEAP BY THE TERROR OF THE TOOTH AND THE CLAW THAT ARE CLOSE BEHIND IT THE SECRET FEELING HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD THAT THE TENACIOUS ADHERENCE TO BARDO'S WISHES ABOUT THE LIBRARY HAD BECOME UNDER EXISTING DIFFICULTIES A PIECE OF SENTIMENTAL FOLLY
HUNG THE CRUCIFIX ROUND HER NECK AND HID IT IN THE BOSOM OF HER MANTLE FOR DINO'S SAKE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
THE LUSTRE OF GOOD FORTUNE WAS UPON HIM HE WAS SMILING LISTENING AND EXPLAINING WITH HIS USUAL GRACEFUL UNPRETENTIOUS EASE AND ONLY A VERY KEEN EYE BENT ON STUDYING HIM COULD HAVE MARKED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN HIM WHICH WAS NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LAPSE OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS
WITHOUT HUMAN INSTRUMENTS WHOM IT WOULD NOT BE UNBECOMING TO KICK OR TO SPIT UPON IN THE ACT OF HANDING THEM THEIR WAGES
THAN ON THAT GREEK EPIGRAM OF POLITIAN'S AFTER SUFFICIENT INTRODUCTORY TALK CONCERNING TITO'S TRAVELS AFTER A SURVEY AND DISCUSSION OF THE GEMS AND AN EASY PASSAGE FROM THE MENTION OF THE LAMENTED LORENZO'S EAGERNESS IN COLLECTING SUCH SPECIMENS OF ANCIENT ART
IT WAS PRESENTLY TO BE ENTERED BY THE MAN WHOM THE POPE'S COMMAND HAD BANISHED FROM THE PULPIT OF THE DUOMO WHOM THE OTHER ECCLESIASTICS OF FLORENCE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO CONSORT WITH WHOM THE CITIZENS HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HEAR ON PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION
MANY OF THEM HAVING FATHERS BROTHERS OR COUSINS AMONG THE ARTISANS AND SHOPKEEPERS WHO MADE THE MAJORITY OF THE CROWD IT WAS NOT TILL THE TALE OF MONKS WAS COMPLETE NOT TILL THEY HAD FLUTTERED THEIR BOOKS AND HAD BEGUN TO CHANT THAT PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER
WERE LESS AFRAID OF CHANGE AND THERE WAS A FORCE OUTSIDE THE PALACE
WERE SEATED ON ONE SIDE OF HIM ON THE OTHER TWO FRIENDS NOT OPPRESSIVELY ILLUSTRIOUS AND THEREFORE THE BETTER LISTENERS YET TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GOUT MESSER BARTOLOMMEO'S FELICITY WAS FAR FROM PERFECT IT WAS EMBITTERED BY THE CONTENTS OF CERTAIN PAPERS THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
WHY FRA GIROLAMO SAID AS GOOD AS THAT WIDOWS OUGHT NOT TO MARRY AGAIN STEP IN AT THE DOOR AND IT'S A SIN AND A SHAME IT SEEMS BUT COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND YOU'RE WELCOME TWO CHILDREN SANTIDDIO COUSIN
AND IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE THE NEXT UNLESS A TRAITOR TURNED UP LAMBERTO DELL ANTELLA HAD BEEN TORTURED IN AID OF HIS PREVIOUS WILLINGNESS TO TELL MORE THAN HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS ADDITIONAL AND STRONGER FACTS WERE DESIRABLE
I KNOW I CAN'T PAY YOU FOR IT BUT I TOOK IT INTO THE NUNZIATA LAST NIGHT AND IT'S TURNED A WORSE COLOUR THAN BEFORE IT'S THE CONVULSIONS BUT WHEN I WAS HOLDING IT BEFORE THE SANTISSIMA NUNZIATA
AH DOCTOR IT IS NOT BY LIVING AT PADUA THAT YOU CAN LEARN TO KNOW FLORENTINES MY BELIEF IS THEY WOULD STONE THE HOLY FATHER HIMSELF IF THEY COULD FIND A GOOD EXCUSE FOR IT AND THEY ARE PERSUADED THAT YOU ARE A NECROMANCER
THE TRAGEDY OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH OF FRA GIROLAMO'S CONFESSION OF DUPLICITY UNDER THE COERCION OF TORTURE LEFT HER HARDLY ANY POWER OF APPREHENDING MINOR CIRCUMSTANCES
MONNA BRIGIDA'S MOUTH TWITCHED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN HER AWE OF ROMOLA AND THE DESIRE TO SPEAK UNSEASONABLY LET BE FOR THE PRESENT SHE THOUGHT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I TELL THIS LITTLE CONTADINA
THE REST OF THE NOBLES AND GENTRY WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE GREAT HOUSES OF FLORENCE AND THE TERRIBLE SOLDIERY WERE ENCAMPED IN THE PRATO AND OTHER OPEN QUARTERS THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY WAS ENDED BUT THE STREETS STILL PRESENTED A SURPRISING ASPECT SUCH AS FLORENTINES HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE UNDER THE NOVEMBER STARS
HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH WANTED YOU KNOW HE SPEAKS SO WELL I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT HIS VALUE IS UNDERSTOOD YOU ARE CONTENTED THEN MADONNA ORGOGLIOSA SAID BERNARDO SMILING AS HE MOVED TO THE DOOR ASSUREDLY POOR ROMOLA
EVEN UNDER STRONG SOLICITATION FROM OTHER THOUGHTS ROMOLA FOUND HER HEART PALPITATING IF SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A PAIR OF ROUND BROWN LEGS OR OF A SHORT WOMAN IN THE CONTADINA DRESS SHE NEVER FOR A MOMENT TOLD HERSELF THAT IT WAS HEROISM OR EXALTED CHARITY IN HER TO SEEK THESE BEINGS
THE SHEAVES OF BANNERS WERE UNFURLED AT THE ANGLES OF THE BAPTISTERY BUT THERE WAS NO CARPET YET ON THE STEPS OF THE DUOMO
SHE MONNA BRIGIDA MUST REAR THEM TOO ONLY THEY MUST BE FOUND FIRST ROMOLA FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THAT INNUENDO BUT STRONG FEELING UNSATISFIED IS NEVER WITHOUT ITS SUPERSTITION EITHER OF HOPE OR DESPAIR ROMOLA'S WAS THE SUPERSTITION OF HOPE
POLITIAN FOUND THE VERSES VERY PRETTY AND HIGHLY FACETIOUS THE MORE WAS THE PITY THAT THEY WERE SERIOUSLY INCORRECT AND INASMUCH AS SCALA HAD ALLEGED THAT HE HAD WRITTEN THEM IN IMITATION OF A GREEK EPIGRAM POLITIAN BEING ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WELL TRIED SKILL COULD HE NOT STRIP HIMSELF OF THE PAST AS OF REHEARSAL CLOTHING AND THROW AWAY THE OLD BUNDLE TO ROBE HIMSELF FOR THE REAL SCENE IT DID NOT ENTER INTO TITO'S MEDITATIONS ON THE FUTURE THAT ON ISSUING FROM THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND DESCENDING THE STAIRS
BEGUN TO SHOW THE PRESIDING SPIRIT OF THE POPULAR PARTY A FEIGNED DEFERENCE OTHERS WERE SINCERE ADVOCATES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT BUT REGARDED SAVONAROLA SIMPLY AS AN AMBITIOUS MONK HALF SAGACIOUS HALF FANATICAL
VARYING HER DIRECTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE VAGUE HOPE THAT IF BALDASSARRE WERE STILL ALIVE SHE MIGHT ENCOUNTER HIM PERHAPS SOME ILLNESS HAD BROUGHT A NEW PARALYSIS OF MEMORY AND HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHERE SHE LIVED FORGOTTEN EVEN HER EXISTENCE
STILL LESS HAD I THOUGHT EVER TO WRITE A BOOK MY FIRST PUBLICATION WAS AN EIGHTY PAGE PAMPHLET DESCRIPTIVE OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY PRINTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY MY FIRST REAL BOOK HOP CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES
THEY CAME IN THE GREAT CEDAR LOG CANOES MANNED WITH TWENTY PADDLERS OR MORE FOR THE MOST PART I MANAGED MY INDIAN WORKERS VERY EASILY ONCE I HAD TO TIE UP TWO OF THEM TO A TREE FOR GETTING DRUNK THEIR FRIENDS CAME AND STOLE AWAY THE PRISONERS
WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE NUMBER OF BIG FLIES THAT RAN THE CATTLE NEARLY WILD I STOOD ON THE WAGON TONGUE FOR MILES TO REACH THEM WITH THE WHIPSTOCK THE CATTLE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE DID NOT STOP AT NOON BUT DROVE ON
GLEN ROCK IS A SMALL VILLAGE BUT THE LADIES THERE MET AND RESOLVED THEY WOULD HAVE AS NICE A MONUMENT AS CASPER'S ONE ENTHUSIASTIC LADY SAID WE WILL INSCRIBE IT OURSELVES IF NO STONECUTTER CAN BE HAD
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN A BIT OF BAD LUCK OLD OREGON TRAIL MONUMENT EXPEDITION BRADY ISLAND NEBRASKA AUGUST NINTH NINETEEN O SIX
WITH LONG SHELVES IN FRONT OF THEM WHILE THE SMALLER TOTS SAT ON LOW BENCHES NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN THE WEATHER WOULD PERMIT THE TEACHER LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO ADMIT MORE LIGHT
WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY SERIOUS SCRAPE EXCEPT WITH ONE AUTOMOBILIST WHO BECAME ANGERED BUT AFTERWARDS WAS AS GOOD AS PIE THIRTY DAYS SATISFIED ME WITH NEW YORK
AND I HAD JUST GONE AROUND THE CORNER TO ENGAGE QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT WHEN THIS OCCURRED RETURNING I SAW THE YOUNG POLICEMAN ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE TEAM BUT AS HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULDN'T BUDGE A PEG WHEREUPON HE ARRESTED MY DRIVER AND TOOK HIM AWAY
AND WAS ABANDONED BY HIS TRAVELING COMPANIONS AFTER HAVING CRAWLED ALMOST FORTY MILES HE FINALLY DIED NEAR THE BLUFF THAT BEARS HIS NAME THIS OCCURRED PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY FROM THE BLUFF WE DROVE AS DIRECTLY AS POSSIBLE
NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
RICH FIELDS OF GRAIN AND HAY AND BEETS COVER THE VALLEY GREAT SUGAR FACTORIES RAILROADS BUSINESS BLOCKS AND FINE HOMES TELL OF THE PROSPERITY THAT HAS LEAPED OUT OF THE PARCHED PLAINS WE TRAILED ACROSS
A PART OF THE ELABORATE PROGRAM WAS AN ATTACK BY INDIANS ON AN EMIGRANT TRAIN THE INDIANS BEING REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG MEN OF THE CITY AT THIS JUNCTURE I ARRIVED IN THE CITY AND WAS BESOUGHT TO GO AND REPRESENT THE TRAIN
AND TOOK THE SUBLETTE CUT OFF OVER TO BEAR RIVER THIS WAS A SHORTER TRAIL TO THE OREGON COUNTRY
ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
IT MAY EASILY BE GUESSED THAT THE PRIDE OF ANTICIPATED SUCCESS DIED OUT AND DEEP DISCOURAGEMENT SEIZED UPON ME I HAD TWO YOKES ONE A HEAVY OX YOKE THE OTHER A LIGHT COW'S YOKE BUT THE COW I THOUGHT
PASSING PACIFIC SPRINGS AT THE SUMMIT WE ROLLED OVER TO BIG SANDY CREEK
NOW SERVED ME WELL I COULD ROW A BOAT MY FIRST VENTURE ACROSS THE SNAKE RIVER WAS WITH THE WAGON GEAR RUN OVER THE WAGON BOX THE WHOLE BEING GRADUALLY WORKED OUT INTO DEEP WATER THE LOAD WAS SO HEAVY
SUCH IS THE RECORD IN MY JOURNAL OF THIS NOBLE ANIMAL'S DEATH I THINK HE DIED FROM EATING SOME POISONOUS PLANT WHEN WE STARTED
BUT AFTER THAT I TOOK LIGHTER LOADS AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE WORK WITH THE CHANGE FROM THE INTOLERABLE DUST TO THE CLEAR ATMOSPHERE OF THE RIVER SOME PEOPLE WERE SO INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA OF FLOATING ON THE WATER
BUT WHERE WERE THE CAMP FIRES WHERE WAS THE HERD OF GAUNT CATTLE WHERE THE SOUND OF THE DIN OF BELLS THE HALLOOING FOR LOST CHILDREN OR THE LITTLE GROUPS OFF ON THE HILLSIDE TO BURY THE DEAD ALL WERE GONE
I HAD NO GUN WITH ME AND I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THERE WAS NO USE TO RUN WAS I SCARED DID YOU SAY DID YOU EVER HAVE CREEPERS RUN UP YOUR BACK AND RIGHT TO THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR AND NEARLY TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE MADE NO PROTEST WHILE HAVING THE BROKEN TEETH REPAIRED OR EXTRACTED THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO FIND JIM THAN TO OFFER A REWARD I DID THIS AND FEEL SURE I PAID TWENTY DOLLARS TO ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE THEFT
AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
AND RISES CONESHAPED FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO THE BASE OF THE SPIRE LIKE ROCK THE CHIMNEY THAT RESTS UPON IT AND RISES A FULL HUNDRED FEET MORE A LOCAL STORY RUNS THAT AN ARMY OFFICER TRAINED A CANNON ON THIS SPIRE
AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
WON'T YOU TAKE HER BACK AND GIVE ME ANOTHER I ASKED THE SELLER YES I WILL GIVE YOU THAT RED COW ONE I HAD REJECTED AS UNFIT BUT NOT ONE OF THE OTHERS WHAT IS THIS COW WORTH TO YOU THIRTY DOLLARS
WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
AND HE PULLED A SHOE OFF HIS FEET WAS I MERCIFUL THEN OR DID I EXACT MORE THAN I OUGHT I CAN SEE HIM YET IN MY MIND ON HIS KNEES HOLDING THE WAGON FROM ROLLING INTO THE CANYON TILL THE WHEEL COULD BE BLOCKED AND THE BRAKES SET
GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
AND SOME EVEN LOST THEIR LIVES AFTER TERRIBLE HARDSHIPS THE SURVIVORS REACHED THE ROAD AGAIN TO BECOME OBJECTS OF CHARITY I KNEW ONE SURVIVOR WHO WAS OUT SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT FOOD
AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
I DID CLAMBER THROUGH ON THE LEFT BANK OVER BOULDERS HEAD HIGH UNDER SHELVING ROCKS I ATE SOME RIPE GOOSEBERRIES FROM THE BUSHES GROWING ON THE BORDER OF THE RIVER
THE TIRE BORE THIS SIMPLE INSCRIPTION REBECCA WINTERS AGED FIFTY YEARS THE HOOFS OF STOCK TRAMPED THE SUNKEN GRAVE AND TROD IT INTO DUST BUT THE ARCH OF THE TIRE REMAINED TO DEFY THE STRENGTH OF THOUGHTLESS HANDS THAT WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT
THEN WHEN BIDDEN TO START THE LOAD HE DID NOT FLINCH
AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
INDEED THE OX IS ALWAYS PATIENT AND USUALLY QUITE OBEDIENT BUT WHEN OXEN GET HEATED AND THIRSTY THEY BECOME HEADSTRONG AND RECKLESS AND WON'T OBEY
WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
THE PEOPLE HAVE CARRIAGES OR AUTOMOBILES THEY CAN TRAVEL ON ANY OF THE EIGHTEEN PASSENGER TRAINS THAT PASS DAILY THROUGH PUYALLUP OR ON STREET CARS TO TACOMA AND ALSO
ANOTHER POLICEMAN TRIED TO COAX ME TO DRIVE THE TEAM DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION I SAID NO SIR I WILL NOT HE COULDN'T DRIVE THE TEAM TO THE STATION AND I WOULDN'T AND SO THERE WE WERE TO ARREST ME WOULD MAKE MATTERS WORSE
AS TO BE HARDLY OBSERVABLE THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE SOUTH PASS PRESENTS A WIDE OPEN UNDULATING COUNTRY THE PASS OFFERS THEREFORE AN EASY GATEWAY TO THE WEST
CALLED HIS MAN OFF AND ORDERED MY DRIVER RELEASED IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS AN ORDINANCE AGAINST ALLOWING CATTLE TO BE DRIVEN ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK OF COURSE THIS WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO LOOSE CATTLE
SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
WE HAD NO TROUBLE TO GET THE CATTLE ACROSS ALTHOUGH THE RIVER WAS WIDE DANDY WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING I ASKED OF HIM SO LEADING HIM TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH A LITTLE COAXING I GOT HIM INTO SWIMMING WATER
BUT SEEING THAT THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES OF GREAT GAIN I TOOK PAINS TO STUDY HOP CULTURE AND FOUND THAT BY ALLOWING OUR HOPS TO MATURE THOROUGHLY CURING THEM AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AND BALING THEM WHILE HOT
BROKE THE HARNESS AND WENT UP THE TOWPATH AT A TWO FORTY GAIT AS I HAD WALKED INTO ONEIDA THE NIGHT BEFORE I DID NOT SEE THE SIGHT OR HEAR THE WAR OF WORDS THAT FOLLOWED THE MEN ORDERED MARDEN TO
WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
AND I FORGAVE THE DEBT TAKING NO JUDGMENTS AGAINST THEM AND I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THE ACTION ALL MY ACCUMULATIONS WERE SWEPT AWAY AND I QUIT THE BUSINESS OR RATHER THE BUSINESS QUIT ME
MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
THERE ARE PRONOUNCED INDIVIDUALITIES IN ANIMALS AS WELL AS IN MEN I MIGHT HAVE SAID VIRTUES TOO AND WHY NOT IF AN ANIMAL ALWAYS DOES HIS DUTY AND IS FAITHFUL AND INDUSTRIOUS WHY NOT RECOGNIZE THIS CHARACTER
NOBODY HAD HORSE TEAMS AT THE START WE HAD TO GO WITH OX TEAMS WE COULD NOT MAKE THE TRIP OUT AND BACK IN ONE DAY AND WE DID NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY HOTEL BILLS
WITH ALL SORTS OF BUILDINGS AND RUINS ONE OF THE OLD BARRACKS THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG WAS IN GOOD PRESERVATION IN NINETEEN O SIX BEING UTILIZED BY THE OWNER JOSEPH WILDE FOR A STORE POST OFFICE HOTEL AND RESIDENCE
WHY YES OF COURSE THEY WILL WORK I SAID IN REPLY TO A BYSTANDER'S QUESTION
THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
FOR WHICH THEY WOULD PAY ME NO NOT FOR PAY I SAID BUT I WILL GO SO THERE WAS QUITE A REALISTIC SHOW IN THE RING THAT AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND THE HOSPITAL RECEIVED MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS BENEFIT
AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
AND OH WHAT AN APPETITE WE WOULD HAVE AND HOW BRIGHT THE FIRE WOULD BE
COMING THROUGH IDAHO I HAD NOTICED THAT AT SODA SPRINGS THE HAND OF THE VANDAL HAD BEEN AT WORK
THE THING WAS COMING RIGHT TOWARDS ME IN AN INSTANT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A GREAT COUGAR HE WAS PRETTY BUT HE DID NOT LOOK ESPECIALLY PLEASING TO ME I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
PUT HER IN THE YOKE AND SHE WOULD STAND STOCK STILL JUST LIKE A STUBBORN MULE HITCH THE YOKE BY A STRONG ROPE BEHIND THE WAGON WITH A HORSE TEAM TO PULL AND SHE WOULD BRACE HER FEET AND ACTUALLY SLIDE ALONG BUT WOULD NOT LIFT A FOOT
AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
AND IN FACT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT I WANTED TO DRIVE DOWN BROADWAY FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER AND I DID A MONTH LATER ALL HANDS SAID NOTHING SHORT OF AN ORDINANCE BY THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN WOULD CLEAR THE WAY SO I TACKLED THE ALDERMEN
THEY WENT TO BED EARLIER THAN SOME BOYS AND GIRLS DO THESE DAYS IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THE WRECK OF THE STEAMER NORTHERNER BROUGHT GREAT SORROW TO US
COULD NOT BE WORKED ALONGSIDE THE OX IN THE OX YOKE NOR THE OX WITH THE COW IN THE COW YOKE I WAS WITHOUT A TEAM BUT WITH A DOUBLE ENCUMBRANCE YES THE OX HAS PASSED FOR IN ALL NEBRASKA I WAS UNABLE TO FIND EVEN ONE YOKE
JUST BEFORE I GOT TO STUCK RIVER CROSSING I CAME TO A TURN IN THE TRAIL WHERE IT CROSSED THE TOP OF A BIG FIR THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP BY THE ROOTS AND HAD FALLEN NEARLY PARALLEL WITH THE TRAIL
THIS UNEXPECTED PROSPERITY CAME TO US THROUGH THE HOP GROWING INDUSTRY UPON WHICH WE ENTERED WITH ALL OUR FORCE THE BUSINESS WAS WELL STARTED BY THE TIME OF MY FATHER'S DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE AND IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS FOLLOWING
SHOT OFF ABOUT THIRTY FEET FROM THE TOP AND FOR THIS WAS COURT MARTIALED AND DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY I COULD GET NO DEFINITE CONFIRMATION OF THE STORY
THE FUN OF IT WAS THAT THE GUN THAT HAD SPREAD SUCH CONSTERNATION HADN'T BEEN LOADED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS
A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
EVEN IF HE IS NOTHING BUT AN OX TO UNDERSTAND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS OX IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THE BURDEN THAT HE CARRIED
STEAMBOAT SPRING WAS SPOUTING AT REGULAR INTERVALS AS WE PASSED JUST AFTER LEAVING SODA SPRINGS OUR LITTLE COMPANY OF FRIENDS SEPARATED
TO MARK THE TRAIL AND KEEP ALIVE THE MEMORY OF THE PIONEERS MOREOVER I RECALLED THE ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION IN SO MANY PLACES THE OUTPOURING OF CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN THE WILLING HANDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THESE MONUMENTS
THAT IT WAS HARD TO SEE THE ROAD EVEN WHEN THE SUN WAS SHINING ON A CLOUDY DAY IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE NIGHT THOUGH I COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP ON THE CROOKED TRAIL
WE HAD BEGUN A TRADING VENTURE IN A SMALL WAY THE VENTURE HAVING PROVED SUCCESSFUL WE INVESTED ALL OUR SAVINGS IN A NEW STOCK OF MERCHANDISE AND THIS STOCK
AS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WHEN THE SUMMIT WAS PASSED I FELT THAT MY TASK WAS MUCH MORE THAN HALF DONE THOUGH HALF THE DISTANCE WAS SCARCELY COMPASSED ON JUNE THIRTIETH AT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK
ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
SOME THEIR OXEN TO DRAG THEM OTHERS THEIR SAWS AND CLEAVING TOOLS TO MAKE CLAPBOARDS FOR THE ROOF OTHERS AGAIN MORE HANDY WITH TOOLS MADE THE BENCHES OUT OF SPLIT LOGS OR
AS WE THEN CALLED THE EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTRY AND RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA BY WAY OF THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA HE HAD BROUGHT FIFTY SWARMS OF BEES THREE OF THESE SWARMS HE SENT UP TO ME IN WASHINGTON
AT DOUGLAS ALSO AN EARNEST WELL ORGANIZED EFFORT TO ERECT THE MONUMENT WAS WELL IN HAND BEFORE WE DROVE OUT OF TOWN AS WE JOURNEYED ON DOWN THE PLATTE WE PASSED THRIFTY RANCHES AND THRIVING LITTLE TOWNS
WHO PUSHED THE SUBJECT ASIDE WITH I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK INTO IT HADN'T I BEEN COMPELLED TO PASS SEVERAL TOWNS
WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
I FINALLY STOPPED PUT HIM ON THE OFF SIDE GAVE HIM THE LONG END OF THE YOKE AND TIED HIS HEAD BACK WITH THE HALTER STRAP TO THE CHAIN BUT TO NO PURPOSE
ALL THE WHILE I WAS SEARCHING FOR AN OX OR A STEER LARGE ENOUGH TO MATE THE DAVE OX BUT WITHOUT AVAIL FINALLY AFTER LOOKING OVER A THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE IN THE STOCKYARDS OF OMAHA I FOUND A FIVE YEAR OLD STEER DANDY WHICH I BROKE IN ON THE WAY TO INDIANAPOLIS
IT WAS ALLISON'S IDEA TO GET THE HAT TO MATCH THE COAT AND IT WAS SUCH A DEAR WE COULDN'T HELP TAKING IT
YOU NEEDN'T THINK IT AND BESIDES THERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN ABOUT AND THAT IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CHURCH WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BABY SIX MONTHS OLD YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER BROUGHT YOU HOME TO OUR HOUSE AND THE FIRST SUNDAY THEY WERE THERE
PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER GO TO THE HOTEL AND LIE DOWN I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MAYBE WORN OUT
WHEN ARE THOSE MEN COMING BACK TO FINISH UP SUDDENLY DEMANDED LESLIE POISING A GLASS OF MILK AND A COOKY IN ONE HAND AND TAKING A GREAT BITE FROM HER APPLE NOT TILL TO MORROW SAID JULIA CLOUD LOOKING AROUND THE EMPTY KITCHEN SPECULATIVELY
IF JULIA HAD BEEN SURE THAT THIS IDEA HAD ENTERED INTO HER SISTER'S THOUGHTS SHE MIGHT HAVE SLAMMED THE DOOR IN PROFESSOR ARMITAGE'S FACE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO COME AND ASK TO BE TAKEN INTO CLOUDY VILLA AS A BOARDER
I DON'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT TO GRANDMOTHER BUT OH YOU WOULD LOOK SO SWEET IN GRAY GRAY AND LAVENDER AND SOFT PINK OR JUST GRAY NOW FOR A WHILE ARE YOU VERY MAD AT ME FOR SAYING IT JULIA CLOUD REACHED OVER AND PATTED THE YOUNG HAND THAT LAY NEAR HER ON THE SEAT
THAT THEY WERE TO STAY DOWN UNTIL THE VERY LAST THING AND NOW HE HAS TAKEN THE TABLE EVEN I WENT UP STAIRS TO SEE IF I COULD GET AT THINGS AND I FIND HE HAS PUT THEM AWAY AT THE BACK
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL COMFORT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OF COURSE BUT THIS BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THAT LITTLE OLD RATTY CHURCH AND I HAVEN'T ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT AND I WANT YOU TO FORGET IT CLOUDY FOR I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT
THE PLEASANT AROMAS OF COFFEE AND SAUSAGES WERE MINGLING IN THE AIR WHEN GUARDY LUD WOKE UP AND LOOKED ABOUT THE OLD FASHIONED ROOM WITH A SENSE OF SATISFACTION THE VERY PICTURES ON THE WALLS RESTED HIM THEY REMINDED HIM SO MUCH OF THE ROOMS IN HIS BOYHOOD HOME
BUT LONG AFTER THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP JULIA CLOUD LAY AWAKE AND THOUGHT IT OUT GOD HAD BEEN GOOD TO HER AND WAS LEADING HER INTO GREEN PASTURES BESIDE QUIET WATERS BUT THERE WERE THINGS HE WAS EXPECTING OF HER AND WAS SHE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FULFIL THEM
LESLIE EYED HER THOUGHTFULLY AND RAISED ONE BROW INTENSIVELY AT HER BROTHER AS SHE ROSE FROM THE TABLE ALLISON LANDED THEM AT A BIG DEPARTMENT STORE AND GUIDED HIS AUNT TO THE TRUNK DEPARTMENT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO STAY THERE UNTIL HE AND LESLIE CAME BACK
AND I DECLARE I NEVER LAID EYES ON A WOMAN THAT I THOUGHT COULD FILL THE PART BETTER JULIA CLOUD WAS QUITE OVERWHELMED BUT THE MATTER OF THE SALARY TROUBLED HER I THINK IT SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF MONEY SHE DEMURRED I WOULD RATHER DO IT FOR LOVE YOU KNOW
SO LESLIE WENT BACK AND FORTH CARRYING BLANKETS AND QUILTS AND HANGING THEM ON THE LINE TILL MISSUS PERKINS HAD TO COME OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON SHE CAME WITH A CUP IN HER HAND TO ASK FOR SOME BAKING POWDER AND JULIA CLOUD GAVE HER THE WHOLE BOX
WHILE ALLISON WENT AFTER THE CAR TO TAKE HIM TO THE TRAIN IS THAT MAN MARRIED BECAUSE IF HE ISN'T I DON'T THINK IT'S RESPECTABLE FOR YOU TO GO AND LIVE NEAR HIM DECLARED ELLEN IN A PENETRATING VOICE TO THE INTENSE DISTRESS OF JULIA CLOUD WHO WAS HAPPILY HURRYING THE DISHES FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE
THEN THEY WENT OFF WITH GREAT GLEE AND MANY WHISPERINGS IT IS A CURIOUS THING HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY YOUNG PEOPLE CAN SHOP PROVIDED THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY AND NO OLDER PERSON BY TO HAMPER THEM ALLISON AND LESLIE WERE BACK WITHIN THE TIME THEY HAD SET
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT JUST IN THAT WAY YOU CALLED CHRIST OUR ALUMNUS THE OTHER NIGHT REMINDED THE LITERAL YOUTH SOLEMNLY SO I DID ACKNOWLEDGED ALLISON EMBARRASSEDLY WELL I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT KIND OF LINE
THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE DINING ROOM WHILE ELLEN READ JULIA MOVING ON QUIET FEET ABOUT THE TABLE PUTTING THINGS TO RIGHTS SHE HAD FINISHED HER PART OF THE ARGUMENT SHE WAS RESOLUTELY PUTTING OUT OF HER MIND THE THINGS HER SISTER HAD JUST SAID AND REFUSING ALTOGETHER TO THINK OF HERBERT
DON'T LET'S WASTE ANY TIME WHAT CAN I DO FIRST WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TAKE DOWN ALL THE PICTURES ON THE SECOND FLOOR STACK THEM IN THE ATTIC AND SWEEP DOWN THE WALLS THE WAY WE DID DOWN HERE YESTERDAY
I'M JUST GOING UP TO LOOK OVER SOME OF MY MOTHER'S THINGS AND SHE TURNED TO THE BACK STAIRWAY AND WENT UP CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER MISTER LUDDINGTON GAZED AFTER HER A SECOND AND THEN TAKING HIS GLASSES OFF AND WIPING THEM ENERGETICALLY HE REMARKED
HE TOLD JULIA CLOUD OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW MORE THAN PLEASED HE WAS WITH WHAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIS CHILDREN AND INSISTED THAT HER SALARY SHOULD BE TWICE AS LARGE
AND BEGGED A THOUSAND PARDONS FOR PRESUMING BUT CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL EVEN THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO LIKE HIM IN A WAY AND DID NOT IN THE LEAST MIND HAVING HIM AROUND BUT THE DAY CAME AT LAST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER OR NEARER TO THE SPRING
THAT'S WHERE OUR ALUMNI COME IN THEY OFTEN RUN DOWN TO COLLEGE FOR A FEW DAYS AND HELP US OUT WITH MONEY AND INFLUENCE AND EXPERIENCE IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD WORKING ALUMNI YOU'RE RIGHT IN IT YOU SEE WE GENERALLY APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH THE ALUMNI
AND OUT OF IT ROLLED A BEAUTIFUL LONG SOFT THICK GRAY CLOAK OF FINEST TEXTURE AND SILKEN LINING WITH A GREAT PUFFY COLLAR AND CUFFS OF DEEP SOFT SILVER GRAY FOX
WILL YOU COME WHY YES IF ALLISON DOES I WILL AGREED LESLIE DIMPLING THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID BRYAN TURNING BACK TO ALLISON NOW WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU RUSH YOU'LL HAVE TO TEACH US HOW WELL SAID ALLISON THOUGHTFULLY
AND THEY'LL CHOOSE THAT KIND FOR LIFE I'M ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE WORK YOU'RE DOING MISS CLOUD I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER MOTHER FOR EM IF I'D SEARCHED HEAVEN I'M SURE AND SO JULIA CLOUD WAS WELL CONTENT TO GO ON WITH HER BELOVED WORK AS HOME MAKER
SAID JULIA CLOUD FEELING THAT IN VIEW OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN SHE WANTED TO BE ENTIRELY HONEST THAT THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT REST TOO HEAVILY UPON HER ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT NO DOUBT SAID GUARDY LUD THOUGHTFULLY
SO JULIA CLOUD SETTLED DOWN TO THE PLEASURE OF A NEW AND DELICIOUS COMBINATION OF FOODS AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT ALL NOW SAID LESLIE AS THE MEAL DREW TO A CLOSE WE MUST GET TO WORK IT'S HALF PAST TWO AND THE STORES CLOSE AT HALF PAST FIVE
COST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT LOOK AND LESLIE FLOURISHED A HANDFUL OF BILLS SEE WHAT GUARDY LUD GAVE ME AND ALLISON HAS ANOTHER JUST LIKE IT
AND JUMPED DOWN FROM HER PERCH TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THE BREATH OUT OF JULIA CLOUD BUT CHILD DEAR SAID THAT GOOD WOMAN WHEN SHE COULD GET HER BREATH TO SPEAK YOU MUSTN'T BEGIN IN THAT EXTRAVAGANT WAY
LOVE'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE OLD MAN SMILING BUT THIS THING HAS GOT TO BE ON A BUSINESS BASIS OR THE TERMS OF THE WILL WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO AGREE TO IT YOU SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO UNDERTAKE MEANS WORK AND IT MEANS STICKING TO IT
WE'RE A COMMITTEE REPEATED YOUNG HERRICOTE SITTING DOWN ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AND LOOKING AROUND MOST UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE LUXURIOUS APARTMENT HE HAD NOT REALIZED IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
AND COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM THROWING HER ARMS ABOUT THE CHILDREN RIGHT THERE IN THE STORE BUT SHE STOPPED IN TIME AND LET HER EYES DO THE CARESSING AS SHE SAID WITH A TREMBLE IN HER LOW SWEET VOICE O YOU DEAR CHILDREN HOW YOU ARE GOING TO SPOIL ME
AND NICEST OF ALL TO HAVE THEM SEE YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE DEAR FLATTERING CHILD SAID JULIA CLOUD LOVINGLY IT IS SO GOOD TO KNOW YOU FEEL THAT WAY BUT NOW HERE COMES ALLISON
BUT LESLIE CAME TO THE RESCUE OH INDEED AUNT ELLEN HE'S VERY MUCH MARRIED ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH MARRIED FOR COMFORT HE WOULD BE A DEAR IF IT WASN'T FOR HIS SILLY LITTLE OLD BOSSY WIFE BUT HE DOESN'T INTEND TO LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR US HIS HOME IS OFF IN CALIFORNIA
IT'S LIKE CHILD'S PLAY GOING UP I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE CONSOLATION FOR HAVING SUCH A LITTLE PLAYHOUSE AFFAIR TO LIVE IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB UP FAR WELL WE'VE COME TO STAY TWO DAYS IF YOU WANT US HERBERT SAID HE COULD SPARE THAT MUCH TIME OFF
WHY NO DEAR I'M NOT MAD AND I DON'T CARE FOR BLACK MYSELF I DON'T BELIEVE IN WEARING BLACK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT US AND GONE TO HEAVEN IT SEEMS TO ME WHITE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER BUT I PUT ON THESE THINGS TO PLEASE ELLEN SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SHOWING GREAT DISRESPECT TO MOTHER
THINK AGAIN WHY I'M NOT EVEN WHAT YOU'D CALL A CHRISTIAN HE SURELY WOULDN'T CALL PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T WELL WHAT YOU'D CALL ENLISTED WITH HIM WOULD HE HE MIGHT ANSWERED JULIA CLOUD REFLECTIVELY SHE WAS SITTING ON THE END OF THE BIG BLUE COUCH
HE CAUGHT THE AMUSEMENT AND FIRED UP AT IT
THE DETAILS DID NOT TAKE LONG AFTER ALL FOR MISTER LUDDINGTON WAS A KEEN BUSINESS MAN AND HE HAD GONE OVER THE WHOLE PROPOSITION AND HAD THE PLAN IN WRITING FOR HER TO SIGN TELLING JUST WHAT WERE HER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH REGARD TO HIS WARDS
WHERE LAY THE PAPER SHE AND MISTER LUDDINGTON HAD JUST SIGNED AND A COPY OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM SHE RETURNED TO HER ASTONISHED SISTER WITH THE PAPER IN HER HAND PERHAPS IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL FOR YOU TO READ THIS SHE SAID WITH DIGNITY
OF TOILET ARTICLES AND BRUSHES IN NEAT COMPACT FORM SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH WITH DELIGHT AS SHE TOUCHED THE SOFT WHITE LEATHER LINING AND NOTICED THE PERFECTION AND FINISH OF THE WHOLE IT SEEMED FIT FOR A QUEEN YET WAS PLAIN AND QUIET ENOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE FOR A DOVE TO CARRY
ALLISON POLITE TO THE LAST CLOSED THE DOOR WITH A COURTEOUS GOOD NIGHT AND THEN STOOD FROWNING AT THE FIRE JULIA CLOUD CAME SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM AND WENT AND STOOD BESIDE HIM WITH LOVING QUESTION IN HER EYES HE MET HER GAZE WITH A NEW KIND OF HARDNESS
HE HAD A FEELING THAT OLD FASHIONED THINGS WERE BEST AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE OWNED A HOUSE MOST DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE HIMSELF AND KNEW THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT FOR A MINUTE HAVE TOLERATED ANY OLD FASHIONED THINGS ABOUT
NO PAPER ON THE WALL THAT'S QUEER ISN'T IT AND THE CHIMNEY RIGHT IN THE ROOM
THEY BOTH BROKE DOWN AND LAUGHED BUT I'M GLAD THEY CAME CLOUDY I TRULY AM IT WAS NICE TO PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN
AND SO THEY WENT HOME TO BEGIN ANOTHER HAPPY WINTER BUT THE VERY FIRST DAY THERE CAME A RIFT IN THEIR HAPPINESS IN THE SHAPE OF THE NEW PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY A MAN ABOUT JULIA CLOUD'S AGE WHOM ELLEN ROBINSON HAD MET ON HER VISIT TO THAYERVILLE
LESLIE CAUGHT HER EYE WHAT IS IT DEAR DOES SOMETHING TROUBLE YOU IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME ASKED JULIA CLOUD PUTTING UP A PROSPECTING HAND TO HER HAIR AND HAT LESLIE'S CHEEKS WENT ROSY RED O CLOUDY DEAR SAID LESLIE I WAS JUST WONDERING
BUT LESLIE INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING FOR MY ROOM AND THOSE CRAZY EXTRAVAGANT CHILDREN WENT AND BOUGHT IT WHEN I HAD MY HEAD TURNED YOU DON'T SAY SAID ELLEN ROBINSON PUTTING A HARD INVESTIGATING FINGER ON THE FOOT BOARD WELL IT DOES SEEM SORT OF SMOOTH
THEN HE HAD TO MEET JANE BRISTOL AND HOWARD LETCHWORTH JULIA CLOUD WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND DELIGHTED WHEN HE SET HIS APPROVAL UPON BOTH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS SUITABLE FRIENDS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE BOTH POOR AND EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING
AND AS SHE CAUGHT THE GLOW AND GLINT FROM THE WINDOW SHE REMEMBERED THE GRAY EVENING WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED OUT ACROSS INTO HER FUTURE AS SHE SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE HOW BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL THAT THE GRAY HAD CHANGED TO GLOW
I'VE A LOT OF SHOPPING TO DO HOW ABOUT YOU CLOUDY I MUST BUY A TRUNK SAID JULIA CLOUD THOUGHTFULLY AND A HAND BAG AND SOME GLOVES I OUGHT TO GET A NEW WARM COAT BUT THAT WILL DO LATER
WATCHING JANE BRISTOL'S SWEET SMILE AS SHE TALKED OVER SOME COMMITTEE PLANS WITH ALLISON I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE ABOUT AS WHOLESOME A COUPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS COULD BE FOUND TO MATCH YOUR TWO
NO I WON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE BOOKS THEY'LL NEED TO BE DUSTED AND PUT IN BOXES THERE ARE A LOT OF BOXES IN THE CELLAR AND THERE'S A PILE OF PAPERS TO USE FOR LINING THE BOXES
HAVE ALLISON AND LESLIE GOT ANY SWEETHEARTS YET SHE ASKED PRYINGLY AS SHE FOLLOWED HER SISTER DOWN THE STAIRS I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE BY THIS TIME THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY YOUNG FRIENDS AND WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL TIMES TOGETHER BUT YOU WON'T SEE MANY OF THEM NOW
WHEN LESLIE AND ALLISON BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT PROFESSOR ARMITAGE CAME TO SEE THEIR CLOUDY JEWEL
IT WAS STRANGE HOW GOOD EVEN SHREDDED WHEAT BISCUIT AND MILK CAN TASTE WHEN ONE HAS BEEN WORKING HARD AND HAS A YOUNG APPETITE ALTHOUGH LESLIE AND ALLISON HAD BEEN KNOWN TO SCORN ALL CEREALS STILL THERE WERE COOKIES AND WONDERFUL APPLES FROM THE BIG TREE IN THE BACK YARD FOR DESSERT
JULIA CLOUD BADE MISTER LUDDINGTON GOOD BY STANDING ON HER OWN FRONT STEPS AND THEN WAITED A MOMENT LOOKING OFF TOWARD THE HILLS WHICH HAD SHUT IN HER VISION ALL HER LIFE THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD RUSHED DOWN TO THE CAR AND WERE PULLING THEIR GUARDIAN JOYOUSLY INSIDE
THE IDEA THAT GOD WOULD CALL ME TO DO ANY OF HIS WORK WHEN I NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE CHURCH IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T WANT TO HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT TO DO WHY SHOULD HE EVER CALL ME I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT CHURCHES YOU'RE ALL OFF CLOUDY
BUT HIS WIFE WAS NOT SO MINDED AND THAT ENDED IT BUT IT ROLLED A GREAT BURDEN FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE THEM IN SUCH CAPABLE HANDS THEY HAD A ROLLICKING TIME AT BREAKFAST FOR GUARDY LUD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE CRISP BROWN SAUSAGES
ARE YOU WILLING TO SIGN IT OF COURSE THERE'S A CLAUSE IN THERE ABOUT REASONABLE NOTICE IF THERE IS DISSATISFACTION ON EITHER SIDE THAT LETS YOU OUT AT ANY TIME YOU GET TIRED OF IT ONLY GIVE ME A CHANCE TO LOOK AFTER THESE YOUNGSTERS PROPERLY
WITH A FOUNTAIN PLAYING NEARBY OVER FERNS AND IVY CLIMBING OVER A MIMIC PERGOLA
WELL WELL BLESS MY SOUL IT MUST BE GETTING LATE WE'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME I DIDN'T REALIZE THOSE CERTAINLY WERE GOOD BUCKWHEATS MISS CLOUD I SHAN'T FORGET THEM VERY SOON
OVER THE BOX AND FLOOR AND THEN THE TWO CHILDREN CAUGHT IT UP AND ENVELOPED HER IN IT BUTTONING IT DOWN THE FRONT AND TURNING THE COLLAR AROUND HER EARS IT'S YOURS CLOUDY TO KEEP YOU WARM ON THE JOURNEY CRIED LESLIE DANCING AROUND AND CLAPPING HER HANDS
LESLIE TOOK THE CHILDREN UP STAIRS TO WASH THEIR FACES AND FRESHEN UP AND JULIA CLOUD LED HER SISTER TO THE LOVELY GUEST ROOM THAT WAS ALWAYS IN PERFECT ORDER WELL YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THINGS WELL FIXED SAID ELLEN GRUDGINGLY WHAT EASY LITTLE STAIRS
BUT TOWARD THE END OF THEIR TRIP THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO GET RESTLESS FOR THE LITTLE PINK AND WHITE COTTAGE AND HOME WE REALLY OUGHT TO GET BACK AND SEE HOW THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY IS GETTING ALONG SAID ALLISON ONE DAY AS THEY GLIDED THROUGH A LITTLE VILLAGE THAT REMINDED THEM OF HOME
AND WE MUST FINISH UP OUR PLANS FOR THE TRIP AND GET READY TO CLOSE THE HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER THEY HAD A WONDERFUL TRIP TO MOUNTAINS AND LAKES AND SEASIDE STAYING AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WHEREVER THEY LIKED AND EVERYWHERE MAKING FRIENDS AND HAVING GOOD TIMES
I DON'T SEE ANY PLACE AS NICE AS OUR TOWN DO YOU CLOUDY AND I DON'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT ANYWHERE BUT HOME ON SUNDAY DO YOU FOR REALLY ALL THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETIES I'VE BEEN TO THIS SUMMER ACTED AS IF THEIR MEMBERS WERE ALL AWAY ON VACATIONS AND THEY DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT
THEN WITH A GIGGLE TOWARD LESLIE SHE ADDED AS IF IN EXPLANATION SHE WORKS OUT YOU KNOW IT MUST BE VERY HARD FOR HER SAID LESLIE PURPOSELY IGNORING THE INFERENCE WELL YOU KNOW SHE ISN'T IN OUR SET NOBODY HAS MUCH TO DO WITH HER WHY NOT
WAS IT SOME OF THEIR OLD FURNITURE FROM CALIFORNIA OH NO SAID JULIA CLOUD QUICKLY THE PRETTY FLUSH COMING IN HER CHEEKS EVERYTHING WAS BOUGHT NEW EXCEPT A FEW LITTLE BITS OF MAHOGANY DOWN STAIRS WE HAD SUCH FUN CHOOSING IT TOO DON'T YOU LIKE MY FURNITURE
WELL IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY YOU'LL MAKE IT GO I'M SURE ENCOURAGED ALLISON YOU'RE JUST THE KIND OF A FELLOW TO MAKE IT GO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT NOT I I NEVER HEARD OF THE THING TILL LAST WEEK EXCEPT JUST IN A CASUAL WAY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT YET
IF I DIDN'T AND RATHER THAN ARGUE ABOUT IT I DID AS SHE WANTED ME TO BUT I DON'T INTEND TO DARKEN THE PLACE AROUND ME BY DRESSING IN MOURNING CHILD AND I'M GLAD YOU DON'T WANT ME TO I LIKE BRIGHT HAPPY THINGS AND BESIDES LESLIE DEAR YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS A BRIGHT HAPPY WOMAN HERSELF ONCE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE ONE SERVANT WILL BE ALL THAT I SHALL WANT IN A LITTLE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THAT BUT MISTER LUDDINGTON QUITE INSISTED THERE SHOULD BE SERVANTS AND THAT NO WORK OF ANY SORT SHOULD FALL UPON ME HE SAID THAT AS THEIR NEAREST RELATIVE I WAS TO BE IN THE POSITION OF MOTHER AND GUARDIAN TO THEM
AND SETTLED HERSELF IN THE BIG WILLOW CHAIR BY THE LAMP WITH HER BOOK LESLIE WENT BACK TO HER CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND ALLISON FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH A PILLOW HALF OVER HIS EYES BUT ANYBODY WATCHING CLOSELY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HIS EYES WERE WIDE OPEN
IF YOU GET IN TOO MANY OF THAT LAME KIND YOUR SOCIETY'LL GO BAD THE WEAK KIND WILL RULE AND THE MISCHIEF WILL BE TO PAY I SHOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD HELP YOU ANY JUST NOW TO GET IN ANY FOLKS THAT WOULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT A GOOD GIRL JUST BECAUSE SHE EARNS HER LIVING
SHE DECLARED AS HER EYES RESTED ON THE LUXURY EVERYWHERE THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THAT PAINTED FURNITURE MUCH MYSELF SHE SAID AS SHE GLANCED AT THE FRENCH GRAY ENAMEL OF THE BED BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT IF THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU LIKE
I'M AFRAID WE SHALL HAVE TO GET SOME THINGS OUT AGAIN I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN GET ALONG NOT A BIT OF IT CLOUDY SAID LESLIE GIVING A SPRING AND PERCHING HERSELF ON THE DRAIN BOARD OF THE SINK WHERE SHE SAT SWINGING HER DAINTY LITTLE PUMPS AS NONCHALANTLY AS IF SHE WERE SITTING ON A VELVET SOFA
BUT THE DAY AFTER GUARDY LUD LEFT JUST AS THE THREE WERE SITTING TOGETHER OVER A GREAT STATE MAP OF ROADS PERFECTING THEIR PLANS FOR A WONDERFUL VACATION WHICH WAS TO INCLUDE A BRIEF VISIT TO ELLEN ROBINSON AT STERLING A NOISY FORD DREW UP AT THE DOOR
AND THAT HE WANTED THE CHILDREN TO HAVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE DURING THE COMING YEAR ALLISON HAD SPOKEN OF HIS WORK AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH AND HE FELT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WISH OF THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE LIBERALLY TOWARD CHURCH WORK
MY NAME'S HERRICOTE JOE HERRICOTE I'M PRESIDENT OF OUR CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY AND THIS IS ROY BRYAN HE'S THE SECRETARY THIS IS MAME BEECHER I GUESS YOU REMEMBER HER SINGING SHE'S CHAIRMAN OF OUR SOCIAL COMMITTEE
THE ROOMS HAD ASSUMED THAT CLEARED UP READY LOOK THAT RESTS THE TIRED WORKER JUST TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH A CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS BEING QUITE A CHILD TO RUN AWAY THIS WAY WHEN THERE WAS STILL A LOT TO BE DONE
THE COLOR FLAMED INTO JULIA CLOUD'S CHEEKS IN GOOD EARNEST NOW I'M NOT LOOKING FOR SUCH CHANCES ELLEN SHE SAID DECIDEDLY I DON'T INTEND EVER TO MARRY I'M HAPPIER AS I AM
LED HER OUT TO THE UPPER PORCH WITH ITS RUSH RUGS WILLOW CHAIRS AND TABLE AND ITS STONE WALL CROWNED WITH BLOOMING PLANTS AND TRAILING VINES SHE SHOWED HER THE BIRD'S NEST IN THE TREE OVERHEAD WELL SAID ELLEN HALF SOURLY
SO HE TRIED TO FIND SOME ONE THEY HAD LOVED TO GO WITH HIM TO SHOW THAT HE INTENDED ONLY KINDNESS HE WAS NOT LONG IN HEARING OF KIT WHO HAD FOUND A SITUATION AS FOOTMAN AND HE GAINED HIS EMPLOYER'S LEAVE TO TAKE THE LAD WITH HIM
OLIVER WONDERING WHERE IN THE WORLD HE WAS GOING TO BE TAUGHT TO MAKE POCKETBOOKS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING WHEN THE ARTFUL DODGER SIGNED TO HIM TO BE SILENT
HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FOND OF PUNCH AND JUDY SHOWS AND WHENEVER HE HEARD ONE ON THE STREET HE WOULD RUN OUT WITHOUT HIS HAT
MISSUS SPARSIT FOUND BOUNDERBY AT HIS CITY HOTEL EXPLODED WITH THE COMBUSTIBLE INFORMATION SHE CARRIED AND FAINTED QUITE AWAY ON HIS COAT COLLAR FURIOUS AT THE NEWS SHE BROUGHT BOUNDERBY HUSTLED HER INTO A FAST TRAIN AND TOGETHER
WHICH ENDEARED HIM TO THE WHOLE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD AND MADE HIM THE MOST FAMOUS AUTHOR OF HIS DAY OLIVER TWIST CAME FIRST AND IT WAS FOLLOWED BY NICHOLAS NICKLEBY AND THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP
CHARLES DICKENS CHARLES JOHN HUFFHAM DICKENS THE MASTER STORY TELLER WAS BORN IN LANDPORT ENGLAND FEBRUARY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN TWELVE
THESE HAPPY YEARS WERE NOT TO LAST LONG WHEN HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER BECAME POOR AND THE FAMILY WAS OBLIGED TO MOVE TO LONDON WHERE IT LIVED IN A SHABBY HOUSE IN A POOR SUBURB
ALL THE WAY AND COMFORTED HER TO THE END CRUEL WOMEN OF THE PEOPLE SAT ABOUT THE GUILLOTINE KNITTING AND COUNTING WITH THEIR STITCHES AS EACH POOR VICTIM DIED AND WHEN CARTON'S TURN CAME THINKING HE WAS DARNAY
THE HATED MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE THEY CURSED HIM AND LAUGHED MEN SAID OF HIM ABOUT THE CITY THAT NIGHT THAT IT WAS THE PEACEFULLEST MAN'S FACE EVER BEHELD THERE
FOR THEIR CAGES TO BE OPENED TO DESTROY ALL IN THEIR PATH THEY WERE AFRAID OF COURSE TO KEEP ANY WRITTEN LIST OF PERSONS WHOM THEY HAD THUS CONDEMNED SO MADAME DEFARGE THE WIFE OF THE WINE SELLER
THIS IS JUST WHAT HAPPENED TO KROOK AS HE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DIRTY SHOP WITHOUT ANY WARNING ALL IN A TWINKLING HE BLAZED UP AND BURNED CLOTHES AND ALL AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO TELL IT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A LITTLE PILE OF ASHES
BOUNDERBY FLEW INTO A STILL GREATER RAGE AND STAMPED OFF SWEARING HIS WIFE SHOULD COME HOME BY NOON NEXT DAY OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SURE LOUISA DID NOT GO AND NEXT DAY BOUNDERBY SENT HER CLOTHES TO MISTER GRADGRIND
TO THE CRAZY OLD MAN SHE SEEMED AN ANGEL HE DRESSED HIMSELF IN FEAR AND WITH HER LITTLE BASKET ON HER ARM SHE LED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE ON AWAY FROM THE TOWN INTO THE COUNTRY FAR AWAY FROM MISSUS JARLEY WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO THEM
GRANDFATHER SMALLWEED WAS A THIN TOOTHLESS WHEEZY GREEN EYED OLD MISER WHO WAS SO NEARLY DEAD FROM AGE AND ASTHMA THAT HE HAD TO BE WHEELED ABOUT BY HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JUDY HE HAD A WIFE WHO WAS OUT OF HER MIND
ALL THIS WRETCHEDNESS OLIVER BORE AS WELL AS HE COULD WITHOUT COMPLAINING BUT ONE DAY THE COWARDLY APPRENTICE BEGAN TO SAY UNKIND THINGS OF OLIVER'S DEAD MOTHER AND THIS HE COULD NOT STAND
DEAR GENTLE PATIENT NOBLE NELL THE SCHOOLMASTER TOLD THEM OF HER LAST HOURS THEY HAD READ AND TALKED TO HER A WHILE AND THEN SHE HAD SUNK PEACEFULLY TO SLEEP THEY KNEW BY WHAT SHE SAID IN HER DREAMS THAT THEY WERE OF HER WANDERINGS
HE TOLD HIM TO WAIT DURING THE NEXT TWO OR THREE EVENINGS NEAR THE DOOR OF BOUNDERBY'S BANK AND PROMISED THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD SEEK STEPHEN THERE AND TELL HIM FURTHER THERE WAS NO KINDNESS HOWEVER IN THIS PROPOSAL
THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN EASY TASK BUT DICKENS HAD GREAT STRENGTH OF WILL AND A DETERMINATION TO DO WELL WHATEVER HE DID AT ALL AND HE SUCCEEDED JUST AS DAVID COPPERFIELD DID IN THE STORY
WHENEVER THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO THE OLD JEW PLAYED A VERY CURIOUS GAME WITH THE BOYS THIS WAS THE WAY THEY PLAYED IT FAGIN WOULD PUT A SNUFF BOX IN ONE POCKET A WATCH IN ANOTHER AND A HANDKERCHIEF IN A THIRD
WAITED ALL NIGHT FOR TIDINGS BUT NONE CAME THAT NIGHT THE RESCUE HAD NOT PROVED EASY NEXT DAY DEFARGE THE WINE SHOP KEEPER BROUGHT A SHORT NOTE TO LUCIE FROM DARNAY AT THE PRISON
HE AND HIS WIFE WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN ALL THEIR TASTES AND HABITS AND HAD NEVER LOVED EACH OTHER AS WELL AS PEOPLE SHOULD WHEN THEY MARRY PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD MARRIED HIS DORA
AND BECAUSE OF THIS DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE AND THE OTHER PLOTTERS HAD CONDEMNED ALL OF THE NAME OF EVREMONDE TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING
HE HAD THEREFORE MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE COMPANY AND DISAPPEAR
AT LENGTH THE LITTLE ESTHER'S MOTHER HAD MET AND MARRIED SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK AND IN HIS LOVE AND PROTECTION HAD THOUGHT HER DARK PAST BURIED FROM VIEW FOR EVER ALL THIS THE PITILESS LAWYER READ IN THE LETTERS
AFTER EACH MEAL THEY ALL SAT STARING AT THE COPPER AND SUCKING THEIR FINGERS BUT NOBODY DARED ASK FOR MORE ONE DAY THEY FELT SO TERRIBLY HUNGRY
THOSE THUS GUILTY SHOULD BE KILLED THEIR FINE HOUSES BURNED AND ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS PUT TO DEATH SO THAT NOT EVEN THEIR NAMES SHOULD REMAIN IN FRANCE THIS WAS A WICKED AND AWFUL DETERMINATION
TILL HE RECEIVED A PITIFUL LETTER FROM GABELLE WHO EXPECTED EACH MORNING TO BE DRAGGED OUT TO BE KILLED TELLING OF THE PLIGHT INTO WHICH HIS FAITHFULNESS HAD BROUGHT HIM AND BESEECHING HIS MASTER'S AID THIS LETTER
LADY DEDLOCK SEEING THE HANDWRITING ASKED IN AN AGITATED VOICE WHO HAD WRITTEN IT HE ANSWERED THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF ONE OF HIS COPYISTS A MOMENT LATER AS HE WENT ON READING THEY FOUND THAT LADY DEDLOCK HAD FAINTED AWAY
HE WAS SENT ON TO PARIS UNDER A GUARD OF SOLDIERS AND THERE HE WAS AT ONCE PUT INTO PRISON TO BE TRIED AND IN ALL PROBABILITY CONDEMNED TO DEATH AS ONE OF THE HATED NOBLE CLASS WHOM THE PEOPLE WERE NOW KILLING AS FAST AS THEY COULD
ANOTHER DAY WITH NO STEPHEN AND NOW ALMOST EVERY ONE BELIEVED HE WAS GUILTY HAD TAKEN RACHEL'S LETTER AS A WARNING AND HAD FLED ALL THE WHILE TOM WAITED NERVOUSLY BITING HIS NAILS AND WITH FEVERED LIPS
TILL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN SIKES WOKE HIM ROUGHLY AND BADE HIM COME WITH THEM IT WAS FOGGY AND COLD AND DARK OUTSIDE SIKES AND ONE OF THE OTHERS EACH TOOK ONE OF OLIVER'S HANDS
AND STILL STEPHEN HAD NOT COME ON THIS DAY FULL OF HER TROUBLE RACHEL HAD WANDERED WITH SISSY NOW HER FAST FRIEND SOME DISTANCE OUT OF THE TOWN THROUGH SOME FIELDS WHERE MINING HAD ONCE BEEN CARRIED ON SUDDENLY SHE CRIED OUT
AND URGED IT ON HER WITH NO REGARD WHATEVER FOR HER OWN LIKING AT LENGTH
BUT HE ANSWERED SULLENLY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT MISSUS SPARSIT'S FINE BRED NERVES SO SHE INSISTED WERE SO SHAKEN BY THE ROBBERY THAT SHE CAME TO BOUNDERBY'S HOUSE TO REMAIN TILL SHE RECOVERED
BUT THESE POOR WRETCHED PEOPLE HAD BEEN MADE TO SUFFER ALL THEIR LIVES AND THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEM AND CENTURIES OF OPPRESSION HAD KILLED ALL THEIR PITY AND MADE THEM AS FIERCE AS WILD BEASTS THAT ONLY WAIT
THAT SAME NIGHT OF HIS RELEASE ALL THE HAPPINESS OF DARNAY AND LUCIE WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN SOLDIERS CAME AND AGAIN ARRESTED HIM DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE WERE THE ACCUSERS THIS TIME AND HE WAS TO BE RETRIED
SHE COULD NOT HEAR ALL BUT CAUGHT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WAS TELLING HER HE LOVED HER AND BEGGING HER TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND HER HOME AND FRIENDS AND TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM IN HER DELIGHT AND IN THE NOISE OF RAIN UPON THE FOLIAGE
TO TELL THE TRUTH THE OTHERS BELIEVED THE CHILD AND THE OLD MAN WERE RUNNING AWAY FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND THAT A REWARD MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR GIVING THEM UP THE WAY IN WHICH THE MEN WATCHED THEM FRIGHTENED LITTLE NELL AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE SCENE OF THE FAIR
AND THAT SHE HAD WORN HER MAID'S CLOTHES TO MISLEAD ANY OBSERVER THIS WAS A CLEVER TRICK IN THE LAWYER BUT IT PROVED TOO CLEVER FOR HIS OWN GOOD FOR FINDING SHE HAD BEEN ENTICED THERE FOR SOME DEEPER PURPOSE HORTENSE FLEW INTO A PASSION WITH HIM
I SEE THE LIVES FOR WHICH I LAY DOWN MINE PEACEFUL AND HAPPY IN THAT ENGLAND I SHALL SEE NO MORE I SEE LUCIE AND DARNAY WITH A CHILD THAT BEARS MY NAME
WHILE HE LISTENED NOW A THOUGHT CAME TO HIM AS LOUISA TALKED WITH RACHEL HE BECKONED STEPHEN FROM THE ROOM AND TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD PERHAPS AID HIM IN FINDING WORK
HE NOTICED TOO THAT WHENEVER THE ARTFUL DODGER CAME HOME EMPTY HANDED FAGIN SEEMED ANGRY AND CUFFED AND KICKED HIM AND SENT HIM TO BED SUPPERLESS BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT HOME A GOOD NUMBER EVERYTHING WAS VERY JOLLY
MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN A YOUNG WOMAN SHE HAD RUN AWAY FROM HOME WITH HIM A LITTLE CHILD WAS BORN TO THEM WHOM SHE NAMED ESTHER WHEN SHE AND HAWDON HAD SEPARATED HER SISTER TO HIDE FROM THE WORLD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELOPEMENT
SIKES HAD A LOADED PISTOL IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKET AND HE SHOWED THIS TO OLIVER AND TOLD HIM IF HE SPOKE TO ANYBODY ON THE ROAD OR TRIED TO GET AWAY HE WOULD SHOOT HIM WITH IT THEY WALKED A LONG WAY OUT OF LONDON
IN THIS TIME AN ESPECIAL OBJECT OF BOUNDERBY'S NOTICE INDEED THE MILL OWNER HAD DETERMINED TO MARRY HER LOUISA HAD ALWAYS BEEN REPELLED BY HIS COARSENESS AND ROUGH WAYS AND WHEN HE PROPOSED FOR HER
THE EVIL AND FOLLY OF SELFISHNESS IS WHAT DICKENS HAD IN MIND WITH HIS INCREASING WEALTH DICKENS HAD OF COURSE CHANGED HIS MANNER OF LIFE HE LIVED PART OF THE TIME IN THE COUNTRY NEAR LONDON IN BRIGHTON IN DOVER AND IN FRANCE AND ITALY
FOR IN HIS FORTY YEARS HE HAD KNOWN MUCH TROUBLE MANY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD MARRIED UNHAPPILY FOR THROUGH NO FAULT OR FAILING OF HIS OWN HIS WIFE TOOK TO DRINK LEFT OFF WORK AND BECAME A SHAME AND A DISGRACE TO THE TOWN
AND THE BOYS CROWDED AROUND HIM PUTTING THEIR HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS WHICH HE THOUGHT A QUEER JOKE FAGIN GRINNED HORRIBLY AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WAS VERY WELCOME WHICH DID NOT TEND TO REASSURE HIM
WHOSE RAGGED TAILS CAME TO HIS HEELS THE BOY SAW OLIVER'S PLIGHT AND ASKED HIM WHAT THE MATTER WAS MIXING HIS WORDS WITH SUCH A LOT OF STRANGE SLANG THAT OLIVER COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM
WITHOUT REALIZING HOW MUCH WRONG AND MISERY WAS CAUSED BY THE LAW WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO THROW A MAN INTO PRISON FOR DEBT NOR CAN ONE READ BLEAK HOUSE WITHOUT SEEING THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH ROBBED QUAINT MISS FLITE OF HER MIND
THE GRIM OLD NURSE KNEW IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT LUCIE HAD GONE THE COACH WOULD BE PURSUED AND BROUGHT BACK SO SHE PLANTED HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE DOOR OF LUCIE'S ROOM AND WOULD NOT LET MADAME DEFARGE OPEN IT
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO COULD HAVE TOLD OLIVER AND THAT ONE WAS MISSUS BUMBLE SHE KNEW THROUGH THE LOCKET SHE HAD KEPT WHICH HAD BELONGED TO OLIVER'S MOTHER
THE TWO GAMBLERS WHO TEMPTED THE OLD MAN TO STEAL MISSUS JARLEY'S STRONG BOX WERE DETECTED IN ANOTHER CRIME AND SENT TO JAIL BRASS BECAME A CONVICT CONDEMNED TO WALK ON A TREADMILL CHAINED TO A LONG LINE OF OTHER EVIL MEN AND DRAGGING WHEREVER HE WENT A HEAVY IRON BALL
ROUND ABOUT ARE CHALK HILLS GREEN LANES FORESTS AND MARSHES AND AMID SUCH SCENES THE LITTLE CHARLES'S GENIUS FIRST BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF HE DID NOT LIKE THE ROUGHER SPORTS OF HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS
ONE NIGHT HE SAW JOE THE RAGGED CROSSING SWEEPER POINTING OUT TO A WOMAN WHOSE FACE WAS HIDDEN BY A VEIL AND WHOSE FORM WAS CLOSELY WRAPPED IN A FRENCH SHAWL
HE AGREED WITH THE PORTER THAT AS TOM WAS GUILTY OF A CRIME HE MUST CERTAINLY GO WITH HIM
DREW OLIVER INSIDE UP A BROKEN STAIRWAY AND INTO A BACK ROOM HERE FRYING SOME SAUSAGES OVER A STOVE WAS A SHRIVELED OLD JEW IN A GREASY FLANNEL GOWN HE WAS VERY UGLY
AND LEFT SECRETLY SENDING A LETTER BACK TELLING HER WHERE AND WHY HE WAS GOING AND BY THE TIME SHE READ THIS HE WAS WELL ON HIS WAY FROM ENGLAND DARNAY HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NO TROUBLE IN HIS ERRAND AND LITTLE PERSONAL RISK IN HIS JOURNEY
BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS BROTHER LITTLE NELL'S GRANDFATHER COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO KNOW HIM AFTER ALL THE YEARS HE HAD BEEN GONE AND AS FOR LITTLE NELL HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND HE WAS AFRAID IF THEY HEARD A STRANGE MAN HAD COME FOR THEM THEY WOULD TAKE FRIGHT AND RUN AWAY AGAIN
AND HE HEARD IT WITH ASTONISHMENT AND WONDER TO FIND SUCH A GREAT HEART AND HEROISM IN A CHILD HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED SCHOOLMASTER HE TOLD HER IN ANOTHER TOWN TO WHICH HE WAS THEN ON HIS WAY AND HE DECLARED THEY SHOULD GO WITH HIM AND HE WOULD CARE FOR THEM
HE VENTED HIS ANGER ON MISSUS SPARSIT FOR MEDDLING AS HE CALLED IT WITH HIS OWN FAMILY AFFAIRS
TWO PERSONS HOWEVER HAD A SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH ONE OF THESE WAS THE PORTER OF THE BANK WHOSE SUSPICION WAS STRONG THE OTHER WAS LOUISA WHO THOUGH HER LOVE DENIED IT ROOM
THE FEEBLE PINK EYED BUNDLE OF SHAWLS THAT WAS MISSUS GRADGRIND HAPPENING TO DIE AT THIS TIME AND LOUISA BEING ABSENT AT HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL MISSUS SPARSIT SAW HER OPPORTUNITY SHE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN LOUISA FOR MARRYING BOUNDERBY
THE LOCKET FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE MISTRESS OF THE POORHOUSE WHO WAS NAMED MISSUS BUMBLE IT CONTAINED THE DEAD MOTHER'S WEDDING RING AND AS MISSUS BUMBLE WAS A DISHONEST WOMAN
THEY RAN AND ROUSED THE TOWN CROWDS CAME FROM COKETOWN ROPE AND WINDLASS WERE BROUGHT AND TWO MEN WERE LOWERED INTO THE PIT THE POOR FELLOW WAS THERE ALIVE BUT TERRIBLY INJURED
A BURNT MARK IN THE FLOOR AND A STICKY SMOKE THAT STUCK TO THE WINDOW PANES AND HUNG IN THE AIR LIKE SOOT AND THIS WAS ALL THE NEIGHBORS FOUND WHEN THEY CAME TO SEARCH FOR HIM THIS WAS THE END OF KROOK
WHILE HE TOLD HER THAT EVENING IN HIS LODGINGS WHAT HAD OCCURRED
THEN HALF THE MONEY WAS TO GO TO THE OLDER SON THE DYING MAN ALSO WROTE A LETTER TO OLIVER'S MOTHER TELLING HER THAT HE HAD MADE THE WILL AND THAT HE WAS DYING BUT THE OLDER SON WHO WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED
PARIS THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE INDIFFERENCE AND HARSH OPPRESSION OF THE COURT AND THE NOBLES TOWARD THE POOR
HIS JOINTS WERE GETTING STIFF HE MISSED IN HIS TUMBLING AND HE COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE PEOPLE LAUGH AS HE HAD ONCE DONE
BARSAD WHO AS IT HAPPENED WAS NOW A TURNKEY IN THE VERY PRISON WHERE DARNAY WAS CONFINED HAD LEFT LONDON TO BECOME A SPY IN FRANCE FIRST ON THE SIDE OF THE KING AND THEN ON THE SIDE OF THE PEOPLE
HE LOOKED UP AS THEY CAME NEAR IT WAS THE KIND OLD SCHOOLMASTER IN WHOSE SCHOOL THEY HAD SLEPT BEFORE THEY MET MISSUS JARLEY IN HER HOUSE ON WHEELS WHEN SHE SAW HIM LITTLE NELL SHRIEKED AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS AT HIS FEET
WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AMUSING SO THAT HE FOUND LIFE NO BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN AT THE WORKHOUSE THE UNDERTAKER HAD AN APPRENTICE TOO WHO KICKED HIM WHENEVER HE CAME NEAR
THERE CAME A DAY WHEN BOUNDERBY WAS SUMMONED ON BUSINESS TO LONDON AND LOUISA STAYED MEANWHILE AT THE BOUNDERBY COUNTRY HOUSE WHICH LAY SOME DISTANCE FROM COKETOWN MISSUS SPARSIT GUESSED THAT HARTHOUSE WOULD USE THIS CHANCE TO SEE LOUISA ALONE
AND WHICH CONTAINED THE DEAD WOMAN'S WEDDING RING WITH HER NAME ENGRAVED INSIDE IT
THEY TALKED MUCH OF LITTLE NELL AND THE STRANGE CHANCE BY WHICH THE LOST HAD BEEN FOUND A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED IN THE VILLAGE TO WHICH THEY WERE NOW BOUND WHO HAD HIMSELF BEEN KIND TO THE CHILD AND TO THE OLD MAN WHOM THE NEW SCHOOLMASTER HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HAD WRITTEN OF THE PAIR TO KIT'S EMPLOYER
AND THE CURIOUS GAME HE HAD LEARNED AT FAGIN'S HE KNEW THEN THAT THE ARTFUL DODGER WAS A PICKPOCKET HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT FOR A MINUTE HE LOST HIS WITS AND RAN OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
THE LATTER HAD MADE UP HER MIND AS CARTON HAD SUSPECTED TO DENOUNCE LUCIE ALSO IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW TO MOURN FOR ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONDEMNED AS AN ENEMY TO FRANCE AND THE WOMAN WAS SURE OF COURSE THAT LUCIE WOULD BE MOURNING FOR HER HUSBAND
TO SAVE HIMSELF HE HAD TO PROMISE NEXT DAY DARNAY WAS TRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME WHEN THE JUDGE ASKED FOR THE ACCUSATION DEFARGE LAID A PAPER BEFORE HIM
BECAUSE SOMEHOW MANY FIGURES WOULD NOT STAY IN HER HEAD AT ONE TIME WHEN THE CIRCUS FIRST CAME HER FATHER WHO LOVED HER VERY MUCH
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHY FOR MONKS WAS REALLY OLIVER'S OLDER HALF BROTHER A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THIS STORY BEGAN OLIVER'S FATHER HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GO ON A TRIP TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY
DICKENS SOON CAME TO REGRET THE WRITING OF THESE CHAPTERS AND WHEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER HE VISITED THE UNITED STATES A SECOND TIME HE DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO SHOW HIS KINDLY FEELING AND AMERICA ADMIRED AND LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT IT GRADUALLY FORGOT THE INCIDENT
AND THE TITLE WAS THE SIGNAL FOR RUDE THREATS AND ILL TREATMENT ONCE IN HE COULD NOT GO BACK AND HE FELT AS IF A MONSTROUS NET WERE CLOSING AROUND HIM AS INDEED IT WAS FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO ESCAPE
LIVED TO MARRY DICK SWIVELLER THE CLERK OF BRASS THE LAWYER WHILE MEEK MISSUS QUILP AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DROWNING MARRIED A CLEVER YOUNG MAN AND LIVED A PLEASANT LIFE ON THE DEAD DWARF'S MONEY THE FATE OF THE OTHERS WHOSE WICKEDNESS HAS BEEN A PART OF THIS STORY WAS NOT SO PLEASANT
DAY AFTER DAY HE WENT TO AND FROM HIS WORK ALONE
ONE EVENING THE TWO WALKED INTO THE COUNTRY BEYOND THE TOWN AND A SUDDEN THUNDER STORM AROSE THEY TOOK SHELTER AT AN INN ON THE HIGHROAD AND WHILE THEY WAITED THERE SOME ROUGH MEN BEGAN A NOISY GAME OF CARDS BEHIND A SCREEN
SUCH HE SAID AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN AND THREW BOTH ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK THEY DID NOT KNOW AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS DEAD THEY LAID LITTLE NELL TO REST THE NEXT DAY IN THE CHURCHYARD WHERE SHE HAD SO OFTEN SAT
MISTER GRADGRIND HAD CONSENTED NOW HOWEVER AT BOUNDERBY'S ADVICE HE WISHED HE HAD NOT DONE SO AND STARTED OFF WITH THE OTHER TO THE PEGASUS'S ARMS TO FIND SIGNOR JUPE AND DENY TO LITTLE SISSY THE RIGHT OF ANY MORE SCHOOLING
HE HAD INDEED BY THE STORY OF HIS OWN SUFFERINGS SAVED DARNAY'S LIFE FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THE PRISONER HE HAD BEEN TOLD COULD NOT BE RELEASED WITHOUT TRIAL FOR THIS TRIAL THEY WAITED DAY AFTER DAY
SHAME ON THE EGOIST WHO THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF LET US LOOK AND SEE THEN HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR CONCERNS
THE NOTHING OUT OF WHICH I MYSELF AS CREATOR CREATE EVERYTHING AWAY THEN WITH EVERY CONCERN THAT IS NOT ALTOGETHER MY CONCERN
ALL POWERS THAT ARE ALIEN TO HIM THE MIND ALL SUPERHUMAN HEAVENLY UNHUMAN POWERS MUST BE OVERTHROWN AND THE NAME MAN MUST BE ABOVE EVERY NAME
IS LEFT TO CHANCE BUT IF EVERY DOOR IS TO BE BOLTED AGAINST EGOISM IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO STRIVE AFTER COMPLETELY DISINTERESTED ACTION TOTAL
THE CAUSE OF MANKIND OF TRUTH OF FREEDOM OF HUMANITY OF JUSTICE FURTHER THE CAUSE OF MY PEOPLE
SUCH IS THE ATTITUDE OF CRITICISM TOWARD LABOR IT POINTS TO MIND WAGES THE WAR
CHARTERED FREEDOM IS NO FREEDOM SINCE ONLY THE FREEDOM ONE TAKES FOR HIMSELF THEREFORE THE EGOIST'S FREEDOM RIDES WITH FULL SAILS DONATED FREEDOM STRIKES ITS SAILS AS SOON AS THERE COMES A STORM OR CALM IT REQUIRES ALWAYS A
THE SOCIALISTS TAKING AWAY PROPERTY TOO DO NOT NOTICE THAT THIS SECURES ITSELF A CONTINUED EXISTENCE IN SELF OWNERSHIP IS IT ONLY MONEY AND GOODS THEN THAT ARE A PROPERTY OR IS EVERY OPINION SOMETHING OF MINE
BUT TO SEEK ITS VALUE IN ME ONE OFTEN HEARS THAT POT BOILING STUDY WHICH IS SO COMMON COUNTED AMONG THE MOST REPULSIVE TRAITS OF EGOISTIC BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT MANIFESTS THE MOST SHAMEFUL DESECRATION OF SCIENCE
I FOR MY PART TAKE A LESSON FROM THEM AND PROPOSE INSTEAD OF FURTHER UNSELFISHLY SERVING THOSE GREAT EGOISTS RATHER TO BE THE EGOIST MYSELF
BUT TO TAKE PART IN THE RIVALRY YOU NEED ONLY TO BE COMMONERS TO TAKE PART IN THE WELFARE ONLY TO BE LABORERS NEITHER REACHES THE POINT OF BEING SYNONYMOUS WITH MAN
AND THAT I SHALL HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE OF MY EMPTINESS I AM NOTHING IN THE SENSE OF EMPTINESS BUT I AM THE CREATIVE NOTHING
MAN MAN IS TO MAN THE SUPREME BEING SAYS FEUERBACH MAN HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED
E INTELLECTUAL MAN THERE IS NO FAMILY AS A NATURAL POWER A RENUNCIATION OF PARENTS BROTHERS ET CETERA MAKES ITS APPEARANCE IF THESE ARE BORN AGAIN
OH YES BUT THAT IS NOT AN EGOISTIC INTEREST NOT INTERESTEDNESS BUT A HUMAN
OR ESSENCE MAN THE LABORER HAS STILL REMAINING THE DESIRE FOR A HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH
EGOIST AND EVERYTHING PRIVATE ITS GOD IN THE FORMER ITS DEVIL IN THE LATTER ROUNDS ITSELF OFF COMPLETELY AND IF THE SPECIAL OR PRIVATE PERSON LOST HIS VALUE IN THE STATE
BUT STOLEN WARES THEY GIVE YOU YOUR OWN FREEDOM THE FREEDOM THAT YOU MUST TAKE FOR YOURSELVES AND THEY GIVE IT TO YOU ONLY THAT YOU MAY NOT TAKE IT AND CALL THE THIEVES AND CHEATS TO AN ACCOUNT TO BOOT IN THEIR SLYNESS THEY KNOW WELL THAT GIVEN
ACQUIESCES IN NOTHING ANALYZES EVERYTHING CRITICISES ANEW EVERY RESULT THAT HAS BEEN GAINED THIS RESTLESS MIND IS THE TRUE LABORER IT OBLITERATES PREJUDICES SHATTERS LIMITS AND NARROWNESSES
HIS JUDGMENT IS THE STRUMPET IS NOT A HUMAN BEING OR SO FAR AS A WOMAN IS A STRUMPET
THE DEPTHS OF THE GODHEAD ITSELF WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MATTER BUT WE DID NOT THINK OF TRUTH ITSELF NOR UNITE INTO ONE SENTENCE GOD IS TRUTH
A HUMAN LIFE FROM THE MOMENT WHEN HE CATCHES SIGHT OF THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD A MAN SEEKS TO FIND OUT HIMSELF AND GET HOLD OF HIMSELF OUT OF ITS CONFUSION IN WHICH HE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
BEHAVE AS IF YOU WERE OF AGE AND YOU ARE SO WITHOUT ANY DECLARATION OF MAJORITY IF YOU DO NOT BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF IT
WILL IT IS TO BE HOPED BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO ON LET US TAKE UP THE INHERITANCE LEFT BY THE ANCIENTS AND AS ACTIVE WORKMEN DO WITH IT AS MUCH AS CAN BE DONE WITH IT
THE SPIRIT WANTS TO SPREAD OUT SO AS TO FOUND ITS EMPIRE AN EMPIRE THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD THE WORLD JUST CONQUERED THUS THEN IT LONGS TO BECOME ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF
ONE ALWAYS REACHES BEYOND THOSE SPECIFICATIONS AND LET ISAACS BE EVER SO JEWISH A JEW NOTHING BUT A JEW HE CANNOT BE JUST BECAUSE HE IS THIS JEW
THE SPOOKS THE POWERS ABOVE OUR FRESH FEELING OF YOUTH THIS FEELING OF SELF NOW DEFERS TO NOTHING THE WORLD IS DISCREDITED FOR WE ARE ABOVE IT WE ARE
IT WILL BE LOST FOR MAN THEREFORE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN LEISURE A HUMAN SIGNIFICANCE BUT YOU LABORERS UNDERTAKE EVEN YOUR LABOR FROM AN EGOISTIC IMPULSE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO EAT DRINK
WHO HAVE BEEN JUDGES HITHERTO MAY REMAIN SO HOWEVER THOROUGHLY ONE HAS CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THEY BEHAVED AS EGOISTS ONLY THEY MUST NOT ANY LONGER
NO PERSONAL PREROGATIVE IF IN THE LABORERS OR RAGAMUFFINS SOCIETY SPECIAL PRIVATE PROPERTY IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZED SO IN HUMAN SOCIETY
WHAT DOES YOUR DEMAND CONCERN HIM WHAT THE CALL TO BE A MAN WHICH YOU ADDRESS TO HIM AS A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE IN THE HUMAN SOCIETY WHICH THE HUMANE LIBERAL PROMISES
HAVE OUTGROWN IT BACK OF THE ROD MIGHTIER THAN IT STANDS OUR OBDURACY OUR OBDURATE COURAGE
AN EFFORT TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD AND ABOVE IT AND WHAT IS THE WISDOM OF THE MANY FOLLOWING CENTURIES WHAT DID THE MODERNS TRY TO GET BACK OF NO LONGER TO GET BACK OF THE WORLD
THE FORMER DOES NOT TRY TO GET HOLD OF THINGS
AND LOOKED INTO ITS HEART SO THAT YOU CAN DOUBTLESS TELL US HOW GOD HIMSELF ATTENDS TO GOD'S CAUSE WHICH WE ARE CALLED TO SERVE
HIGHER CAUSE NOW IT IS CLEAR GOD CARES ONLY FOR WHAT IS HIS BUSIES HIMSELF ONLY WITH HIMSELF THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF
THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY POWER OVER ME AS NO EARTHLY MIGHT HAS POWER OVER THE SPIRIT THE CHILD WAS REALISTIC TAKEN UP WITH THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
MIGHT IS A FINE THING AND USEFUL FOR MANY PURPOSES FOR ONE GOES FURTHER WITH A HANDFUL OF MIGHT THAN WITH A BAGFUL OF RIGHT YOU LONG FOR FREEDOM YOU FOOLS IF YOU TOOK MIGHT FREEDOM WOULD COME OF ITSELF
IS TRUE ANY THOUGHT BOUND TO A THING IS NOT YET NOTHING BUT A THOUGHT ABSOLUTE THOUGHT TO BRING TO LIGHT THE PURE THOUGHT OR TO BE OF ITS PARTY
THEREFORE SELFISHNESS IS IN A BAD WAY TOO SELFISHNESS
CAUSE BUT WE WE ARE NOT ALL IN ALL AND OUR CAUSE IS ALTOGETHER LITTLE AND CONTEMPTIBLE
DISINTERESTEDNESS THIS ALONE IS HUMAN BECAUSE ONLY MAN IS DISINTERESTED THE EGOIST ALWAYS INTERESTED
BUT OF THE THOUGHTS THAT LIE HIDDEN IN THINGS
IN PRESENCE OF ANOTHER I GIVE MYSELF UP
THE SULTAN HAS SET HIS CAUSE ON NOTHING BUT HIMSELF HE IS TO HIMSELF ALL IN ALL HE IS TO HIMSELF THE ONLY ONE AND TOLERATES NOBODY WHO WOULD DARE NOT TO BE ONE OF HIS PEOPLE
GIVE WAY DESIST SUBMIT THEREFORE BY LOYALTY SUBMISSION FOR IT IS ONE THING WHEN I GIVE UP MY PREVIOUS COURSE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT LEAD TO THE GOAL AND THEREFORE TURN OUT OF A WRONG ROAD
UNLESS INDEED THE HEART UNCONSCIOUSLY OR WITHOUT SELF CONSCIOUSNESS LETS THEM SLIP IN THE HEART CRITICISES TO DEATH WITH HARD HEARTED MERCILESSNESS EVERYTHING THAT WANTS TO MAKE ITS WAY IN
A LABORING RAGAMUFFIN LABOR AND SOCIETY ARE OF USE TO HIM NOT AS HE NEEDS THEM AS A MAN BUT ONLY AS HE NEEDS THEM
HUMAN SOCIETY IS BOTH THE MOST GENERAL STATE AND THE MOST GENERAL SOCIETY ONLY AGAINST THE LIMITED STATE IS IT ASSERTED THAT IT MAKES TOO MUCH STIR ABOUT SPIRITUAL PRIVATE INTERESTS
E G THE CUSTOMS OF STUDENTS CLUBS AND OTHER FORMALITIES IT IS BECAUSE AND WHEN
IN THE SECOND PLACE AS A JEW ONE ASSUREDLY CANNOT BE A MAN IF BEING A MAN MEANS BEING NOTHING SPECIAL BUT IN THE THIRD PLACE AND THIS IS THE POINT I CAN AS A JEW
JEW THE CHRISTIAN THE
IN CHILDHOOD LIBERATION TAKES THE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS TO GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF THINGS THEREFORE WE SPY OUT THE WEAK POINTS OF EVERYBODY FOR WHICH IT IS WELL KNOWN
AND HAS ONLY HIMSELF BEFORE HIS EYES WOE TO ALL THAT IS NOT WELL PLEASING TO HIM HE SERVES NO HIGHER PERSON AND SATISFIES ONLY HIMSELF HIS CAUSE IS A PURELY
DESIRE ANYTHING ELSE THAN THAT YOU GROW ENTHUSIASTIC AND SERVE THEM THEY ALL HAVE AN ADMIRABLE TIME OF IT WHEN THEY RECEIVE ZEALOUS HOMAGE JUST OBSERVE THE NATION THAT IS DEFENDED BY DEVOTED PATRIOTS
AND THE SPIRITUAL YET AS IT HAS ONLY MOVED AWAY FROM THE WORLD AND MADE OF ITSELF A BEING FREE FROM THE WORLD
THE MASTERLESSNESS OF MAN COULD NOT BE FILLED WITH A HUMAN ELEMENT BY THE STATE AND THEREFORE WAS LEFT TO ARBITRARY CHOICE IT IS ASSUREDLY NECESSARY THAT MAN BE MASTERLESS
THE PATRIOTS FALL IN BLOODY BATTLE OR IN THE FIGHT WITH HUNGER AND WANT WHAT DOES THE NATION CARE FOR THAT
AND BEGINS A NEW PHASE IN CHILDHOOD WE SCAMPER ABOUT WITHOUT RACKING OUR BRAINS MUCH MIND IS THE NAME OF THE FIRST SELF DISCOVERY THE FIRST UNDEIFICATION OF THE DIVINE
IS TOSSED ABOUT IN MOTLEY MIXTURE
RELIGION PROMISES ME THE SUPREME GOOD TO GAIN THIS I NO LONGER REGARD ANY OTHER OF MY DESIRES AND DO NOT SLAKE THEM ALL YOUR DOINGS ARE UNCONFESSED SECRET COVERT AND CONCEALED EGOISM BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE EGOISM
MY PRINCE MY FATHERLAND FINALLY EVEN THE CAUSE OF MIND AND A THOUSAND OTHER CAUSES ONLY MY CAUSE IS NEVER TO BE MY CONCERN
AS INTELLECTUAL RATIONAL POWERS THEY ARE NO LONGER AT ALL WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE AND NOT ONLY PARENTS BUT MEN IN GENERAL ARE CONQUERED BY THE YOUNG MAN THEY ARE NO HINDRANCE TO HIM
AT ALL WHO HAVE NO DEFINITE OCCUPATION AND THEIR IMMORALITY THE LABORER IS DISGUSTED BY THE IDLER LAZYBONES AND HIS IMMORAL BECAUSE PARASITIC
GOD AND MANKIND HAVE CONCERNED THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING FOR NOTHING BUT THEMSELVES LET ME THEN LIKEWISE CONCERN MYSELF FOR MYSELF
SO OPINION TOO MUST BE TRANSFERRED TO SOMETHING GENERAL MAN AND THEREBY BECOME A GENERAL HUMAN OPINION IF OPINION PERSISTS THEN I HAVE MY GOD WHY
SO THE MOST BRILLIANT THINGS HAPPENED IN THE TIME OF HUMANISM OR AS ONE MIGHT PERHAPS ALSO SAY OF MACHIAVELLIANISM PRINTING THE NEW WORLD ET CETERA
NEITHER FOR HIMSELF NOR FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS NOT FOR PRIVATE MEN THEREFORE BUT FOR HUMANITY AND ITS PROGRESS HE DOES NOT EASE INDIVIDUAL PAINS DOES NOT CARE FOR INDIVIDUAL WANTS
EITHER THE STICK CONQUERS THE MAN
THE FANATICISM OF LIBERTY FOR THIS WOULD BE A FAITH THAT AGREED WITH THE ESSENCE OF MAN AND BECAUSE ONLY MAN IS REASONABLE YOU AND I MIGHT BE VERY UNREASONABLE A REASONABLE FAITH
THE THOUGHTS HAD BECOME CORPOREAL ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT WERE GHOSTS SUCH AS GOD EMPEROR POPE FATHERLAND ET CETERA IF I DESTROY THEIR CORPOREITY
WHEN WE ONCE GET AT WHAT IS BACK OF THE THINGS WE KNOW WE ARE SAFE
TO HAVE A LIKING FOR THE CORPOREAL MAN WITH HIDE AND HAIR WHY THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE A SPIRITUAL WARM HEARTEDNESS IT WOULD BE TREASON AGAINST PURE WARM HEARTEDNESS THE THEORETICAL REGARD
INSTEAD OF BEING MASTERED EITHER BY SENSUALITY OR BY ANYTHING ELSE GOD MAN AUTHORITY LAW STATE CHURCH ET CETERA WHAT IS OF USE TO ME THIS SELF OWNED OR SELF APPERTAINING ONE MY SELFISHNESS PURSUES
BUT BOTH REMAIN ENEMIES AND ALWAYS LIE IN WAIT THEY WATCH FOR EACH OTHER'S WEAKNESSES CHILDREN FOR THOSE OF THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS
BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE SO LONG AS THE AIM OF YOUR EFFORT IS ONLY YOUR WELFARE AND THAT OF ALL WHAT YOU DO FOR THE SOCIETY OF RAGAMUFFINS IS NOT YET ANYTHING DONE FOR HUMAN SOCIETY
AS WITH LUTHER PEOPLE BEGAN TO TAKE THE MATTER TO HEART THE OUTCOME OF THIS STEP OF THE REFORMATION MUST BE THAT THE HEART ALSO GETS LIGHTENED OF THE HEAVY BURDEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE HEART
E G PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND AGAINST LIMITED SOCIETY THAT IT MAKES TOO MUCH OF MATERIAL PRIVATE INTERESTS BOTH ARE TO LEAVE PRIVATE INTERESTS TO PRIVATE PEOPLE AND
AND SETS FORTH IN A DETAILED SPEECH THAT REMOVABLE DISMISSABLE TRANSFERABLE AND PENSIONABLE JUDGES IN SHORT SUCH MEMBERS OF A COURT OF JUSTICE AS CAN BY MERE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BE DAMAGED AND ENDANGERED ARE WHOLLY WITHOUT RELIABILITY
IS DIRECTED AGAINST EGOISM FOR THE EGOIST YOU KNOW NEVER TAKES TROUBLE ABOUT A THING FOR THE SAKE OF THE THING BUT FOR HIS SAKE THE THING MUST SERVE HIM IT IS EGOISTIC TO ASCRIBE TO NO THING A VALUE OF ITS OWN AN ABSOLUTE VALUE
AND PLAYED HERETICAL PRANKS WITH ALL TENETS OF THE FAITH AND THE TALK THEN WAS ESPECIALLY IN ITALY AND AT THE ROMAN COURT IF ONLY THE HEART REMAINS CHRISTIAN MINDED
BECAUSE GOD IS HIMSELF TRUTH AND LOVE YOU ARE SHOCKED BY THE ASSUMPTION THAT GOD COULD BE LIKE US POOR WORMS IN FURTHERING AN ALIEN CAUSE AS HIS OWN
SOMETHING OF MY OWN SO EVERY OPINION MUST BE ABOLISHED OR MADE IMPERSONAL THE PERSON IS ENTITLED TO NO OPINION BUT AS SELF WILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE PROPERTY TO SOCIETY
AND TAKE NO SERIOUS CARE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL'S WANTS ANYHOW NOT FOR YOUR OWN COMFORT NOR FOR THAT OF THE REST BUT YOU MAKE NOTHING OF ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE A DREAMER
AND DO NOT DESIRE IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE THEN I DESIRE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS TO AN END FOR ITS USEFULNESS FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER END E G OYSTERS FOR A PLEASANT FLAVOR NOW WILL NOT EVERY THING WHOSE FINAL END
INTREPIDITY OUR COUNTER FORCE OUR ODDS OF STRENGTH OUR INVINCIBILITY BEFORE THAT WHICH FORMERLY INSPIRED IN US FEAR AND DEFERENCE WE NO LONGER RETREAT SHYLY BUT TAKE COURAGE
THOUGHT OF HIM ONLY AS A DEPENDENT AND WAS PROPERLY NOTHING BUT A SOCIAL THEORY A DOCTRINE OF LIVING TOGETHER AND THAT OF MAN WITH GOD AS WELL AS OF MAN WITH MAN
I LABOR THEREFORE I AM A MAN THE HUMANE LIBERAL WANTS THAT LABOR OF THE MIND WHICH WORKS UP ALL MATERIAL HE WANTS THE MIND THAT LEAVES NO THING QUIET OR IN ITS EXISTING CONDITION THAT
IS THE DELIGHT OF YOUTH AND ALL THE SHAPES OF LIGHT IN THE WORLD OF THOUGHT LIKE TRUTH
AND THE FURNACE IS AS HUNGRY AS A BOY WHILE THE PLUMBER AS HE GLOATS UPON THE LEAKS IS THE MODEL THAT THE PAINTER TAKES FOR JOY AND FROM ALL OF THIS WE LEARN THE LESSON SWEET THE GLAD MESSAGE OF DAME NATURE GRAND AND CLEAR
THERE TO BE CRUSHED AND MAULED AND PULLED AND HAULED UNTIL THERE IS SCARCELY ANYTHING LEFT TO THEM TO FEEL THAT THEY COULD COME TO OUR SHOPNASIUM AND THERE BE TRAINED FOR THE ORDEAL WHICH THEY CANNOT ESCAPE VERY NICE SAID THE DOCTOR BUT HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU TRAIN THEM THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
YOU THINK THAT DO YOU OBSERVED THE BIBLIOMANIAC WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I FOR ONE AM SICK AND TIRED OF POLITICS AND IT WILL BE A GREAT RELIEF TO ME WHEN IT IS ALL OVER
IT WAS TRUE THE GREAT AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY AND WAS GRADUALLY DARKENING I PUT ON MY HAT AND WALKED OUT REFRESHED HAVING SLEPT FROM FIVE TWENTY UNTIL TWELVE OR SIX HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES STRAIGHT
YOU OUGHT TO SUBMIT YOUR TONGUE TO SOME SCIENTIFIC STUDENT OF DYNAMICS I AM INCLINED TO THINK FROM MY OWN OBSERVATION OF ITS WAYS THAT IT CONTAINS THE GERM OF PERPETUAL MOTION I WILL CONSIDER YOUR SUGGESTION REPLIED THE IDIOT MEANWHILE
THERE'LL BE A HOT TIME IN THE OLD TOWN TO NIGHT WILL BECOME AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR A SUDDEN CHILL PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEPLESSNESS CAN DOSE THEMSELVES BACK TO NORMAL CONDITIONS WITH WAGNER THE WAY I DID TCHAIKOWSKY
ON THE SEA SHORE WHERE THE FATLING BOARDERS ARE NOW THE LANDLORD OF THE PASTORAL HOTEL SPENDS HIS MORNINGS NIGHTS AND EKE HIS AFTERNOONS SCHEMING PLANS TO GET MORE MILK FROM OUT THE WELL
NOW THE TROMBONE IS A TOOTING OUT ITS SCALEY SHUTE THE CHUTEING AND THE OBOE IS HOBOING WITH A ZEST NOW THE DRESSMAKERS ARE WORKING NOT A SINGLE MINUTE SHIRKING
WHY NOT ADAPT THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS TO MODERN CONDITIONS
BUT JUST THE CALM QUIET CONTENTED FEELING THAT GOES WITH THE SENSE OF HAVING GOT COMPLETELY RESTED UP YOU RUN A DREADFUL RISK HOWEVER SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE
SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY ARE THE OBLIGATIONS OF LAST MONTH ONE GOOD SWAT DESERVES ANOTHER BY JOVE SAID MISTER BRIEF AS HE READ THEM OFF
BROMIDE POWDERS AND ALL THE REST AND NOT ONE OF THEM PRODUCED ANYTHING LIKE THE SOPORIFIC RESULTS THAT TWO DOSES OF WAGNER BROUGHT ABOUT IN ONE INSTANT AND BEST OF ALL THERE WAS NO REACTION NO SPLITTING HEADACHE OR SHAKY HAND THE NEXT DAY
TAKE A COUPLE OF BARGAIN COUNTERS FOR THE GOALS PLACE ONE AT ONE END OF THE SHOPNASIUM AND ONE AT THE OTHER THEN LET SIXTY WOMEN START FROM NUMBER ONE AND TRY TO GET TO NUMBER TWO ACROSS THE FIELD THROUGH ANOTHER BODY OF SIXTY WOMEN BENT ON GETTING TO THE OTHER ONE AND VICE VERSA
A MAN'S WIFE IS HIS BETTER HALF AND HIS CHILDREN ARE A GOOD PART OF THE REMAINDER AND WHAT THEY DO OR DON'T DO BECOMES A MATTER OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC CONCERN AS A MATTER OF FACT A PUBLIC MAN
THEN YOU CAN HAVE A BLANKET VERSE HE SAID SCRIBBLING WITH HIS PENCIL ON A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND AS TIME GOES ON A STALKING AND THE IDIOT STILL IS TALKING
THE CRICKETS CRY ALL TELL US THAT IT IS JULY
GOOD MORNING HOMER MY BOY SAID THE IDIOT GENIALLY AS THE POET ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM ALL HAIL TO THEE THOU ART THE BRIGHT PARTICULAR BIRD OF PLUMAGE I MOST HOPED TO SEE THIS RARE AND BEAUTEOUS SUMMER MORNING
THAT SCHEME BEARS THE IDIOT BRAND HERE'S ONE ON THE OPENING OF THE OPERA SEASON SAID THE IDIOT NOW THE FIDDLERS TUNE THEIR FIDDLES TO THE LOVELY TARADIDDLES
YOU CAN'T GO BACK ON ANY OF EM CAN YOU NO SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC
I'M AFRAID THAT WILL HAVE TO GO SAID THE IDIOT AND WHY PRAY
BUT I AM IN NO DANGER OF BECOMING A VICTIM TO IT WHILE IT COSTS FROM FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLARS A DOSE IN ADDITION TO THIS EXPERIENCE I HAVE ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS CURED OF A FRIGHTFUL ATTACK OF THE COLIC BY SULLIVAN'S LOST CHORD
INSTEAD OF TAKING A MEDICINE CHEST ALONG WITH THEM WILL BE PROVIDED WITH A MUSIC BOX WITH CYLINDERS FOR MUMPS MEASLES SUMMER COMPLAINT WHOOPING COUGH CHICKEN POX CHILLS AND FEVER AND ALL THE OTHER ILLS THE FLESH IS HEIR TO
I SAT DOWN ON THE TEACHER'S GLASS OF WATER THAT'S THE SORT OF THING SECOND THOUGHT DOES IN THE MATTER OF MORALS I ADMIT OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BETTER THAN FIRST ONES FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS TO NAME THE BABY JIMMIE AND JIMMIE TURNS OUT TO BE A GIRL
BACK PEDAL THERE AVAUNT WITH YOUR FLOWERY SPEECH OH IDIOT CRIED THE DOCTOR ELSE WILL I CALL AN AMBULANCE NO AMBULANCE FOR MINE CHORTLED THE IDIOT NAY SWEET GAS BAGS QUOTH THE DOCTOR
I REALLY THINK DOCTOR THERE'S A CHANCE HERE FOR YOU AND ME TO MAKE A FORTUNE DOCTOR CAPSULE'S SHOPNASIUM OPENED EVERY SEPTEMBER FOR THE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT SHOPPERS IN ALL BRANCHES OF SHOPNASTICS
THINK OF THE GLORY OF WINNING A GOAL WHICH SUSTAINS THE FOOTBALL PLAYER THROUGH THE TOUGHEST OF FIGHTS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE NATION WILL RING WITH ITS PLAUDITS OF HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENT IS HALF THE BACKING OF YOUR QUARTER BACK THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE IDIOT
EVEN I WHO AM ONLY A DABBLER IN MEDICINE AND KNOW NO MORE ABOUT IT THAN THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN REMEDIES UPON MY OWN SYMPTOMS HAVE NOTICED THAT MUSIC OF A CERTAIN SORT IS A SURE EMOLLIENT FOR NERVOUS CONDITIONS FOR EXAMPLE SAID THE DOCTOR
OR INTERFERE WITH HIS CHANCES OF ELECTION IN THE LEAST TAKE THAT OTHER STORY PUBLISHED IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER THAT ON THE TENTH OF LAST AUGUST THOMPSON BONDIFELLER'S YACHT WAS SEEN ANCHORED FOR SIX HOURS OFF TOM WATSON'S FARM
I FEEL THAT POSSIBLY THERE IS A FAMILY AVERAGE THERE THAT MAY BE STRUCK TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNTRY SAY MISTER IDIOT PUT IN THE POET AT THIS POINT WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR ANYHOW
AN AMATEUR CORNETIST WHO OCCUPIED A STUDIO ON THE FLOOR ABOVE BEGAN TO PLAY THE LOST CHORD A COUNTER PAIN SET IN IMMEDIATELY AT THE SECOND BAR OF THE LOST CHORD
AND DOZED OFF INTO A FATHOMLESS SLEEP I DIDN'T WAKE UP THIS TIME UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY THE REST OF THE PARTY HAVING GONE OFF WITHOUT AWAKENING ME AS A SORT OF JOKE CLEARLY WAGNER ACCORDING TO MY WAY OF THINKING THEN
MEN WHO YOU WOULD THINK WOULD SCORN BASENESS AS THEY HATE POISON AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS FOR THREE WEARY MONTHS THE FOLLOWERS OF EACH ATTACK THE CHARACTER AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE OTHER
AND PROVOKES A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT MIRTH YOU DON'T YOURSELF BELIEVE THAT LAST YARN ABOUT THE PROHIBITION CANDIDATE DO YOU I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY YARN ABOUT HIM SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT HE IS THE OWNER OF A BREWERY UP IN ROCHESTER
IT'S A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING TWENTY FOUR TIMES
SO IT HAPPENS THAT WHEN A MAN RUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY THE PERSONS WHO INTRUDE UPON HIS PRIVATE LIFE AS YOU PUT IT ARE CONFERRING A REAL SERVICE UPON THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN I HEAR FROM AN AUTHENTIC SOURCE THAT
MAKING GOWNS WITH FRILLS AND FAL LALS MIGHTY QUEER FOR THE AUTUMN DAYS ARE FLYING AND THERE'S REALLY NO DENYING THAT THE SEASON OF THE OPERA IS NEAR MISTER BRIEF TOOK A HAND IN THE DISCUSSION AT THIS MOMENT
THEIR ENERGY EXHAUSTED AND THEIR SPINES AS LIMP AS A RAG AND YET YOU CLAIM YOU CAN DO NOTHING WHAT WOULD WE THINK OF A FOOTBALL TRAINER WHO WOULD TRY THUS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CONDITION OF HIS ELEVEN AT THE END OF A SEASON WE'D BOUNCE HIM THAT'S WHAT
IN THE PURCHASE OF A CAKE OF SOAP TO SEND TO ONE'S GRANDMOTHER AT CHRISTMAS
WROTE IN HIS MESSAGE TO POSTERITY OH WHEN YOU COME TO CROWN MY BROW BRING ME NO BAY NOR SORREL GIVE ME NO PARSLEY WREATH BUT JUST THE LEGAL LONG GREEN LAUREL I NEVER HEARD THAT POEM BEFORE LAUGHED THE POET
IF JIM JONES WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKED TO PUT HIM THERE
THEY WOULDN'T BE KNOCKED OUT IF YOU GAVE THEM PRELIMINARY INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE WITH PUNCHING BAGS DUMMIES FOR TACKLE PRACTICE AND OTHER THINGS THE FOOTBALL PLAYER USES TO MAKE HIMSELF TOUGH AND IRRESISTIBLE BUT YOU CAN'T REASON WITH SHOPPING AS YOU DO WITH FOOTBALL SUGGESTED THE LAWYER
AND TRYING TO CURE IT AFTER THE FACT THE OUNCE OF PREVENTION IDEA OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED IT SEEMS TO ME INTO THE MATERIA MEDICA WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO MOVE MOUNTAINS DEMANDED THE DOCTOR
BY THE SUM TOTAL OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE WELL YOU NEEDN'T GET MAD ABOUT IT SAID THE LAWYER I NEVER SAID IT SO YOU CAN'T BLAME ME STILL THERE ARE SOME PROVERBS SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER BLANDLY
CAN A MOTORMAN MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF ASKED THE DOCTOR OH YES SAID THE IDIOT EASILY BY BEING CIVIL A CIVIL MOTORMAN WOULD BE UNIQUE BUT HE WOULDN'T MAKE A FORTUNE SUGGESTED THE POET
AND WE LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP FOLLOW THIS LEADER AND GO BLATTING THAT SENTIMENT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES
PERHAPS THAT GIGANTIC INTELLECT OF YOURS HAS SOMETHING TO SUGGEST SNEERED THE DOCTOR CERTAINLY QUOTH THE IDIOT I DREAMED IT ALL OUT IN MY SLEEP LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER HAD STARTED A SERIES OF ESTABLISHMENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
DON'T ASK ME LAUGHED THE IDIOT I DON'T KNOW YET I ADMIRE ALL THE CANDIDATES PERSONALLY VERY MUCH BUT WHAT ARE YOUR POLITICS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC ASKED THE LAWYER OH THAT'S DIFFERENT SAID THE IDIOT
BUT FOR ONCE I FEAR ME WE MAY BE SCORCHED BY THIS PELEE OF WORDS THAT THOU SPOUTEST FORTH WHAT'S THE PROPOSITION MISTER IDIOT ASKED THE POET I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO ANYTHING OF THE KIND AS THE SUBWAY SAID WHEN AN AUTOMOBILE FELL INTO IT
I SEE SAID THE POET IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG TO FILL UP A BOOK WITH STUFF LIKE THAT TO MAKE THE APPEAL STRONGER LET ME TAKE THE MONTH OF JULY
AND I KNOW OF NO BETTER OUTLET FOR REFORM THAN IN THESE SELF SAME SPENCERIAN PROVERBS
HE WAS NOT FITTED BY TEMPERAMENT TO ASSIMILATE ANYTHING QUITE SO STRENUOUSLY CHROMATIC AS THAT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
DESERVES TO RANK AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE NARCOTICS KNOWN TO MODERN SCIENCE I HAVE TRIED ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS SULFONAL TRIONEL
SAID THE POET MOST PUBLIC MEN I KNOW OF WOULD RATHER SPEND THEIR MONEY THAN KISS THE BABIES THAT STYLE OF CAMPAIGNING HAS GONE OUT IT HAS IN THE CITIES SAID THE IDIOT BUT BACK IN THE COUNTRY IT IS STILL DONE
THAT ARE REALLY WORTH READING SAID THE IDIOT WE COULD CALL THAT SECTION THE SEASONS AND MAKE IT THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK IN THE SECOND PART WE COULD DO THE SAME THING ONLY IN GREATER DETAIL FOR EACH ONE OF THE MONTHS
NOW THE FESTIVE CANDIDATE GOES A SPORTING THROUGH THE STATE AND HE KISSES BABES FROM QUOGUE TO KALAMAZOO FOR HE REALLY WANTS TO WIN WITHOUT SPENDING ANY TIN AND HE THINKS HE HAS A CHANCE TO KISS IT THROUGH THAT'S FAIR
IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM A SURGICAL OPERATION LIKE THAT WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE REMOVAL OF A LEG AND I DON'T BELIEVE EVEN WAGNER EVER COMPOSED A MEASURE THAT COULD BE COUNTED ON SUCCESSFULLY TO ELIMINATE ONE'S VERMIFORM APPENDIX FROM ITS CHIEF SPHERE OF USEFULNESS
WILL GO TO THE PIANO AND GIVE THE CHILD A DOSE OF HIAWATHA IF A SMALL BOY GOES SWIMMING AND CATCHES A COLD IN HIS HEAD AND IS DOWN WITH A FEVER HIS NURSE AN EXPERT ON THE ACCORDION
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ASKED THE IDIOT ONLY FAINTLY SAID THE POET I THINK YOU READ IT TO ME ONCE BEFORE JUST AFTER YOU ER AH RATHER JUST AFTER ALFRED AUSTIN BIGGS OF TEXAS WROTE IT THE IDIOT LAUGHED
THAT'S A FAIR DIVISION BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY PROPOSITION WELL IT'S CERTAINLY ER CHEEKY ENOUGH SAID THE POET DO I UNDERSTAND IT YOU WANT ME TO FATHER YOUR POEMS TO TELL THE TRUTH
AND EVEN THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FAIL THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH SAID THE IDIOT
THAT THE MAXIMS AND PROVERBS OF OUR FOREFATHERS ARE LARGELY HOCUS POCUS AND BUNCOMBE I'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT MYSELF FROM THE MOMENT I HAD MY FIRST COPY BOOK LESSON IN WHICH I HAD TO SCRAWL THE LINE
I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT AT HALF AFTER SEVEN AND NEVER WAKED UNTIL NINE THIS MORNING IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SLEEP AND REST I FEEL NOW AS IF I'D BEEN PUT THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE EVERY BONE IN MY BODY FROM THE FUNNY TO THE MEDULLA ACHES LIKE ALL POSSESSED
AND BACKS FIFTEEN SALOONS AND A POOL ROOM IN NEW YORK SAID THE IDIOT OF COURSE I DON'T SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC WHO DOES NOBODY SAID THE IDIOT AND THEREFORE THE STORY DOESN'T HURT THE MAN'S REPUTATION A BIT
UNDER THE MEDICAL DIRECTION OF YOURSELF AND MY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT WOULD BE A WINNER MOREOVER IT WOULD FURNISH A BUSINESS OPENING FOR ALL THOSE FOOTBALL PLAYERS OUR COLLEGES ARE TURNING OUT FOR AS OUR INSTITUTION GREW AND WE ESTABLISHED BRANCHES OF IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WE SHOULD OF COURSE
ARE INSTILLED INTO THE MINDS OF THE YOUNG BY THE OLD PROVERBS AND MAXIMS THAT REMAIN WITH THEM FOREVER
WHY NOT TELL HIM IT'S A LONG WELL THAT HAS NO BOTTOM OR A LONG DOG THAT HAS NO WAGGING OR A LONG RAILROAD THAT HAS NO TERMINAL FACILITIES OH WELL INTERPOSED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT I CAN RECALL IS THAT OF A WAGNER OPERA AND ITS EFFECTS UPON ME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL FROM INSOMNIA I COULD NOT GET TWO HOURS OF CONSECUTIVE SLEEP AND THE EFFECT OF MY SUFFERINGS WAS TO MAKE ME NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE
YES HE WOULD TOO SAID THE IDIOT IF HE COULD PROVE HE REALLY WAS CIVIL THE VAUDEVILLE PEOPLE WOULD PAY HIM A THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK AND TOUR THE COUNTRY WITH HIM HE'D DRAW MOBS WITH WHICH THE IDIOT LEFT THE DINING ROOM
OR IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR BOY BROUGHT UP TO THE STRENUOUS LIFE WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HIM MAKE SIXTY COPIES OF THE APHORISM A PUNCH IN THE SOLAR IS WORTH SIX ON THE NOSE
AND HAS REPEATEDLY AVOWED THAT BREAD AND WATER IS THE PROPER FOOD FOR MOTORMEN EVERYBODY WITH COMMON SENSE REALIZES AT ONCE THAT EVEN THE FLIM FLAM DOESN'T BELIEVE THE STORY IT HURTS NO ONE THEREFORE
AND THAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE REVISED EXACTLY SAID THE IDIOT IT'S A SPLENDID IDEA SAID MISTER BRIEF BUT AFTER ALL YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO BEGIN ON
YOU MAY FIND IT EVEN MORE CONVINCING NOW THE FLY THE RHUBARB PIE THE LIGHTNING IN THE SKY THERMOMETERS SO SPRY THAT LEAP UP HIGH THE ROADS ALL DRY THE HOBOES NIGH THE TOWN A FRY
WHO WILL SOON GRADUATE INTO THE LARGER INSTITUTION OF MATRIMONY THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE FOR US TO BUILD UP A WOMAN OF THE FUTURE
SAID MISTER WHITECHOKER PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE IDEA IS ILL EXPRESSED IN THE ORIGINAL PERFECTLY CORRECT SAID THE IDIOT BUT EVEN THEN WHAT
THANKS TO OUR HABIT OF LEAVING EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE YOU KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN IN YOUR CARE UNLESS THEY HAVE PROPERLY TRAINED FOR THE EXIGENCIES OF THE EPIDEMIC PERIOD WILL BE PROSTRATED PHYSICALLY AND NERVOUSLY RACKED IN BONE AND BODY ACHING FROM TIP TO TOE
SECOND THOUGHTS ARE ALWAYS SECOND PROCRASTINATION IS THE THEME OF GOSSIPS NEVER PUT OFF TO DAY WHAT YOU CAN PUT ON DAY AFTER TO MORROW
THAT'S THE STRANGEST ARGUMENT OF ALL HE SAID THE VERY IDEA OF A MAN WHO DELIBERATELY CHOOSES PUBLIC LIFE AS THE SPHERE OF HIS ACTIVITIES SEEKING TO HIDE BEHIND HIS PRIVATE LIFE IS PREPOSTEROUS
AND THE SOFT AND JOLLY SUMMER TIDE IS HERE HOW'S THAT PRETTY FAIR WELL I MIGHT CONSENT TO BE A COUSIN TO A POEM OF THAT KIND I'VE READ WORSE AND WRITTEN SOME THAT ARE QUITE AS BAD BUT YOU KNOW MISTER IDIOT
HILL ASK ANY MAN IN WALL STREET HOW HIGH THE WATER HAS RUN UP IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND SEE WHAT HE TELLS YOU AND THEN YOU MAY DRIVE A HORSE TO WATER BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE HIM DRINK IS ANOTHER CHOICE SPECIMEN OF THE WATERBURY SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY
THE SECOND THOUGHT IS THE OPEN DOOR TO DUPLICITY WHEN IT COMES TO A QUESTION OF MORALS
IF YOU LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN OF THE AGE BURN THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS AND IN THE MIDDLE WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT YOU PUSH NATURE INTO A CORNER AND THEN GROWL LIKE ALL POSSESSED BECAUSE SHE REBELS NOT I RETORTED THE IDIOT
HE DISCUSSES THE MUSIC CURE GOOD MORNING DOCTOR SAID THE IDIOT AS CAPSULE M D ENTERED THE DINING ROOM I AM MIGHTY GLAD YOU'VE COME
AS PATTERING FEET WADE DEEP IN SLUSH
EVEN SO GREAT A MASTERPIECE AS THAT WON'T MAKE A BOOK SAID THE POET OF COURSE IT WON'T RETORTED THE IDIOT THAT'S ONLY FOR THE SUMMER HERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON WINTER JUST LISTEN NOW THE MAN WHO DEALS IN MITTENS AND IN TABS
YOU COULD TEACH EM ALL THE ARTS OF THE RUSH LINE DEFENCE RUNNING AROUND THE ENDS BREAKING THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND ALL THAT AT FIRST THE SCRIMMAGE WOULD BE PRETTY HARD ON THE BEGINNERS BUT WITH A MONTH'S PRACTICE THEY'D GET HARDENED TO IT AND BY CHRISTMAS TIME THERE ISN'T A BARGAIN COUNTER IN THE COUNTRY
BUT YOUR SELF SUFFICIENT OLD PROVERB MAKER FALLS BACK BEHIND THE IMPENETRABLE WALL OF HIS OWN CONCEIT
SAID HE'D GIVE THE KISSES IN A BUNCH TO A COMMITTEE OF YOUNG LADIES WHO COULD DISTRIBUTE THEM FOR HIM RESULT WAS EVERYBODY WAS DOWN ON HIM EVEN THE YOUNG LADIES I GUESS HE WAS A COUSIN OF YOURS ALL RIGHT LAUGHED THE DOCTOR
HOW WHY HOW ON EARTH DO YOU TRAIN A FOOTBALL TEAM EXCEPT BY PRACTICE DEMANDED THE IDIOT IT WOULDN'T TAKE A VERY INGENIOUS MIND TO FIGURE OUT A GAME CALLED SHOPPING THAT WOULD BE GOVERNED BY RULES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF FOOTBALL
SAID CONNACHAR GELBAN THE CHEERING AND CHARMING SON OF LOCHLIN'S KING
WHEN THEY CAME IN IN VERY DEED I MYSELF HAD NO LIKING FOR THEIR COMPANY STRIKE UP WITH YOU SAID THE HEAD BARD WHY SHOULD WE BE STILL AND SING A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW
SO GREAT WAS THE HEAT OF HIS NATURE THAT WHEN IT RAINED HARDEST WHATEVER HE CARRIED REMAINED DRY FOR A HANDBREADTH ABOVE AND A HANDBREADTH BELOW HIS HAND AND WHEN HIS COMPANIONS WERE COLDEST
HE HAD NO SOONER GOT INSIDE THE GATE AND SHUT IT THAN THE MONSTER CAME UP TO IT AND ENRAGED AT LOSING HIS PRIZE STRUCK THE WALL ABOVE THE GATE AND LEFT THERE THE MARK OF HIS FIVE GREAT FINGERS
THE HERDSMAN BUT THE NEXT DAY AT DAWN THEY RETURNED TO THE CASTLE AND RENEWED THEIR REQUEST
AND LET EVERY ONE MIND THE WORD OF COMMAND SO THE ASS PUT HIS FORE HOOFS ON THE SILL OF THE WINDOW
WELL WELL THROW YOUR TAIL OVER YOUR ARM AND COME ALONG THEY GOT OUTSIDE THE TOWN AND SAT DOWN UNDER AN OLD WALL AND JACK PULLED OUT HIS BREAD AND MEAT AND SHARED WITH THE DOG
WHEN HE GOT TO THE STREET DOOR THE COCK DROPPED DOWN UPON HIM WITH HIS CLAWS AND BILL AND WHAT THE CAT AND DOG DONE TO HIM WAS ONLY A FLAY BITE TO WHAT HE GOT FROM THE COCK
KNOCKED OUT MY EYE WITH ONE OF THE DICE IN HIS HAND BUT OF A TRUTH AND VERITY ALTHOUGH HE PUT OUT EVEN MY EYE IT WERE MY DESIRE STILL TO REMAIN LOOKING AT HER WITH THE OTHER EYE WERE IT NOT FOR THE HURRY YOU TOLD ME TO BE IN SAID GELBAN
AND I THREW IT FROM ME AS FAR AS I COULD OUT ON THE LOCH AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEPTH IN THE PLACE HE SHOUTED WHERE ART THOU RING AND THE RING SAID I AM HERE
IT WAS TAKING UP ITS OTHER LEG BUT BEFORE IT COULD PULL IT OUT OF THE PAVEMENT THE SPRIGHTLY TAILOR HAD FINISHED HIS TASK AND
ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS WILL NOT BE WHAT THEY WANT SAID THE HUNTER CONNACHAR KING OF ULSTER SENT FOR HIS NEAREST KINSMEN AND HE TOLD THEM OF HIS INTENT THOUGH EARLY ROSE THE SONG OF THE BIRDS MID THE ROCKY CAVES AND THE MUSIC OF THE BIRDS IN THE GROVE
THAT THEY THEMSELVES AND THE CHILDREN OF CONALL CAME TO BLOWS THE CHILDREN OF CONALL GOT THE UPPER HAND AND THEY KILLED THE KING'S BIG SON THE KING SENT A MESSAGE FOR CONALL AND HE SAID TO HIM
THE CATS BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR ME THROUGH THE WOOD AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ME AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED EACH ONE SAID TO THE OTHER THAT THEY WOULD TURN BACK BUT SAID THE ONE EYED FOX COLOURED CAT THAT WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OVER THEM
AND TREWS BEING THE VEST AND BREECHES UNITED IN ONE PIECE AND ORNAMENTED WITH FRINGES WERE VERY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE TO BE WORN IN WALKING OR DANCING

CONNACHAR CAME OUT IN HASTE AND CRIED WITH WRATH WHO IS THERE ON THE FLOOR OF FIGHT SLAUGHTERING MY MEN WE THE THREE SONS OF FERCHAR MAC RO WELL SAID THE KING
TO GIVE SCHOOLING AND LEARNING AND MAGIC MYSTERY TO YOU I'LL HOLD YOU TO ACCOUNT IF THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY FROM ME TO DAY WITHOUT CARE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OR REGARD FOR ME WITHOUT CHANCE OF OVERTAKING THEM AND WITHOUT POWER TO STOP THEM
THE SERVANTS WENT OUT AND THE OTHERS WENT TO THEIR HIDING HOLES THE SERVANTS RUMMAGED WELL AND DID NOT FIND A THING
WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SAID JACK HAD THE AIR OF A BORN GENTLEMAN ABOUT HIM AND THE LORD SAID HE'D MAKE HIM HIS STEWARD JACK BROUGHT HIS MOTHER AND SETTLED HER COMFORTABLY NEAR THE CASTLE
AFTER A TIME A DAUGHTER WAS BORN TO MALCOLM HE DID NOT ALLOW A LIVING BEING TO COME TO HIS HOUSE ONLY HIMSELF AND THE NURSE HE ASKED THIS WOMAN WILL YOU YOURSELF BRING UP THE CHILD TO KEEP HER IN HIDING
FULL NOBLE FULL MANLY FULL HANDSOME WITH BEAUTEOUS BROWN LOCKS WENT FORTH GIRT WITH BATTLE ARMS FIT FOR FIERCE FIGHT AND CLOTHED WITH COMBAT DRESS FOR FIERCE CONTEST FIT WHICH WAS BURNISHED BRIGHT BRILLIANT BLADED
SAYS THE SAINT THAT'S THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS NOW

WE'LL GO INTO THE WOOD AND MAKE OUR BED ON THE LONG GRASS NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE JACK STRETCHED HIMSELF ON A BUNCH OF DRY GRASS THE ASS LAY NEAR HIM THE DOG AND CAT LAY IN THE ASS'S WARM LAP
WITH PISTOLS AND BLUNDERBUSHES AND CUTLASHES SITTING AT A TABLE EATING ROAST BEEF AND PORK AND DRINKING MULLED BEER AND WINE AND WHISKY PUNCH
YOU MAY JOIN OUR PARTY IF YOU LIKE AND SIT ON NEDDY'S CRUPPER WHEN YOUR LEGS AND WINGS ARE TIRED WELL THE MARCH BEGAN AGAIN AND JUST AS THE SUN WAS GONE DOWN THEY LOOKED AROUND
I WAS THEN SAID CONALL QUITE A YOUNG LAD AND I WENT OUT HUNTING AND MY FATHER'S LAND WAS BESIDE THE SEA AND IT WAS ROUGH WITH ROCKS CAVES AND RIFTS
AND THE TWO SHOOTS UNITED IN A KNOT ABOVE THE LOCH THE KING ORDERED THE SHOOTS TO BE CUT DOWN AND THIS WAS DONE TWICE UNTIL AT THE THIRD TIME THE WIFE WHOM THE KING HAD MARRIED CAUSED HIM TO STOP THIS WORK OF EVIL
TO GO DOWN TO THE ABODE OF THE STRANGERS AND TO TAKE DEIRDRE UP WITH THEM AND KILL THE REST THE PURSUIT IS COMING SAID DEIRDRE YES
WHEN CONALL AND HIS SONS PERCEIVED THE COMPANY COMING THEY WENT TO THE HIDING HOLES THE KING WAS A WARY MAN AND HE SAW WHERE THE HORSES WERE MAKING A NOISE BE WARY SAID THE KING THERE ARE MEN WITHIN THE STABLE LET US GET AT THEM SOMEHOW
WHEN THE DEW OF JUNE IS AT ITS HEAVIEST A GOLD HILTED SWORD WAS ON HIS THIGH AND THE BLADE WAS OF GOLD HAVING INLAID UPON IT A CROSS OF THE HUE OF THE LIGHTNING OF HEAVEN TWO BRINDLED WHITE BREASTED GREYHOUNDS
WALK ON YOUR TIPPY TOES TILL WE SEE WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO THEY CREPT NEAR THE WINDOW AND THERE THEY SAW SIX ROBBERS INSIDE

AND FROM THAT TIME NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE UPON IT SAVE THE PECKING OF MY BEAK EVERY EVENING AND NOW THERE IS NOT SO MUCH AS THE SIZE OF A NUT REMAINING THEREOF YET THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN BE UPON ME IF DURING ALL THAT TIME
AND NEVER DREW REIN TILL THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WOOD JACK AND HIS PARTY GOT INTO THE ROOM CLOSED THE SHUTTERS LIGHTED THE CANDLES
NO TIME TO LOSE THE SPRIGHTLY TAILOR WAS TAKING THE LONG STITCHES WHEN HE SAW IT GRADUALLY RISING AND RISING THROUGH THE FLOOR
AND A KISS EACH TO HIS BROTHERS WITH THE CONFUSION THAT SHE WAS IN DEIRDRE WENT INTO A CRIMSON BLAZE OF FIRE AND HER COLOUR CAME AND WENT AS RAPIDLY AS THE MOVEMENT OF THE ASPEN BY THE STREAM SIDE
HE GAVE A SPRING AFTER THE RING AND OUT HE WENT IN THE SEA AND I WAS AS PLEASED THEN WHEN I SAW HIM DROWNING
AND KNEW THAT SOME ONE WAS LOOKING AT HER FROM THE BACK OF THE DOOR LEAF HE SEIZED ONE OF THE DICE ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM AND FIRED IT THROUGH THE BICKER HOLE AND KNOCKED THE EYE OUT OF GELBAN GREDNACH THE CHEERFUL AND CHARMING RIGHT THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
BY JAMINEE SAYS KING O'TOOLE IF YOU DO I'LL SAY YOU'RE THE CLEVEREST FELLOW IN THE SEVEN PARISHES OH BY DAD SAYS SAINT KAVIN
THE SERVANTS LOOKED AMONGST THE HORSES AND THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND THEY RETURNED AND THEY TOLD THIS TO THE KING AND THE KING SAID TO THEM THAT IF NOTHING WAS WRONG THEY SHOULD GO TO THEIR PLACES OF REST WHEN THE GILLIES HAD TIME TO BE GONE
AND I HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DESIRED ME
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME I'LL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO GO AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES OH MY POOR CAPTAIN SAYS THEY WE BELIEVE YOU TO THE NINES
WHY SAID CONALL
PLAY UP WITH YOU WHY SHOULD YOU BE SILENT MAKE A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW SAID THE HEAD BARD I HAD NO LIKING AT ALL FOR THE CRONAN BUT UP CAME THE ONE CAT AND TEN AND IF THEY DID NOT SING ME A CRONAN THEN AND THERE
NOW O CONALL SAID THE KING WERE YOU EVER IN A HARDER PLACE THAN TO BE SEEING YOUR LOT OF SONS HANGED TO MORROW BUT YOU SET IT TO MY GOODNESS AND TO MY GRACE AND SAY THAT IT WAS NECESSITY BROUGHT IT ON YOU SO I MUST NOT HANG YOU
WENT DOWN TO THE GREEN KNOLL WHERE DEIRDRE DWELT AND HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE BOTHY THE NURSE REPLIED NO LESS THAN A KING'S COMMAND AND A KING'S ARMY COULD PUT ME OUT OF MY BOTHY TO NIGHT AND I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO YOU WERE YOU TO TELL WHO IT IS
AMIDST THE SPRAY OF THE MEADOW FOUNTAIN BRIGHTER WERE HER GLANCES THAN THOSE OF A FALCON HER BOSOM WAS MORE SNOWY THAN THE BREAST OF THE WHITE SWAN HER CHEEK REDDER THAN THE REDDEST ROSES
THERE IS A SHOUT OF A MAN IN EXTREMITY AND I MUST NOT BE WITHOUT REPLYING TO IT AND THE WISEST OF THE MEN SAID LET IT ALONE TILL WE HEAR IT AGAIN THE CATS BEGAN AGAIN DIGGING WILDLY
I SEE THAT BUT I'LL SEW THIS AND STITCHED AWAY AT HIS TREWS AND STILL IT KEPT RISING THROUGH THE PAVEMENT UNTIL IT SHOOK A GREAT PAIR OF ARMS IN THE TAILOR'S FACE AND SAID DO YOU SEE THESE GREAT ARMS OF MINE
PAY THEM NOW THEIR REWARD SAID THE GREAT FOX COLOURED CAT I AM TIRED MYSELF OF YOURSELVES AND YOUR REWARDS SAID I I HAVE NO REWARD FOR YOU UNLESS YOU TAKE THAT COW DOWN THERE THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE COW AND INDEED
THE KING FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF THE MEN AND HE FOUND THEM EVERY ONE KNEW CONALL FOR HE WAS A VALUED TENANT OF THE KING OF ERIN AND WHEN THE KING BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF THE HOLES HE SAID O CONALL IS IT YOU THAT ARE HERE I AM O KING
AND MERRY MODEST MAIDENS FAIR THAT WOULD LIE DOWN AND RISE WITH HER THAT WOULD PLAY AND SPEAK WITH HER DEIRDRE WAS CLEVER IN MAIDENLY DUTIES AND WIFELY UNDERSTANDING AND CONNACHAR THOUGHT HE NEVER SAW WITH BODILY EYE A CREATURE THAT PLEASED HIM MORE
AND LAUGHING AND CURSING
AND THE BOAR TRUITH THEY HUNTED INTO THE DEEP SEA AND IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHITHER HE WENT
I LEFT THE SKIN OF MY HIPS BEHIND ME BUT I CAME OUT WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CALDRON I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AND SHE SAID TO ME THAT THERE WAS NO WEAPON THAT WOULD KILL HIM BUT HIS OWN WEAPON I BEGAN TO DRAW HIS SPEAR
HE WAS THE BEST OF FOOTMEN AND THE BEST OF KNIGHTS HE WAS NEPHEW TO ARTHUR THE SON OF HIS SISTER AND HIS COUSIN AND ARTHUR CALLED MENW THE SON OF TIERGWAETH IN ORDER THAT IF THEY WENT INTO A SAVAGE COUNTRY
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD OBTAIN THE COMB HE HAD REGAINED THE GROUND WITH HIS FEET AND FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE REACHED THE SHORE NEITHER DOG NOR MAN NOR HORSE COULD OVERTAKE HIM UNTIL HE CAME TO CORNWALL
AND HE FELL COLD DEAD WHERE HE WAS AND YOU MAY BE SURE O KING THAT JOY WAS ON ME
BUT THE WAIL OF THE WAVE SWANS OF CONNACHAR SAID HIS BROTHERS NO
SO SHE STOOD ON THE YARD FENCE AND BLESSED HIM AS FAR AS HER EYES COULD SEE HIM WELL HE WENT ALONG AND ALONG TILL HE WAS TIRED AND NE'ER A FARMER'S HOUSE HE WENT INTO WANTED A BOY
AND SO THE KING HAD HIS GOOSE AS GOOD AS NEW TO DIVERT HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVED AND THE SAINT SUPPORTED HIM AFTER HE CAME INTO HIS PROPERTY AS I TOLD YOU UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND THAT WAS SOON AFTER FOR THE POOR GOOSE THOUGHT HE WAS CATCHING A TROUT ONE FRIDAY
AND THE OWL SAID IF I KNEW I WOULD TELL YOU WHEN FIRST I CAME HITHER THE WIDE VALLEY YOU SEE WAS A WOODED GLEN AND A RACE OF MEN CAME AND ROOTED IT UP AND THERE GREW THERE A SECOND WOOD
SAID SHE WHY DIDST NOT THOU LET THE KING DO HIS OWN PLEASURE TO THY SONS RATHER THAN BE GOING NOW WHILE I KNOW NOT IF EVER I SHALL SEE THEE MORE WHEN HE ROSE ON THE MORROW HE SET HIMSELF AND HIS THREE SONS IN ORDER AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS LOCHLANN
TELL ME ANY CASE IN WHICH YOU WERE AS HARD AS THIS AND IF YOU TELL THAT YOU SHALL GET THE SOUL OF YOUR YOUNGEST SON I WILL TELL A CASE AS HARD IN WHICH I WAS SAID CONALL I WAS ONCE A YOUNG LAD AND MY FATHER HAD MUCH LAND
HELP ME OUT OR I'LL BE DROWNED NEVER SAY'T TWICE SAYS JACK AND HE PITCHED IN BIG STONES AND SODS INTO THE SLOB TILL THE ASS GOT GOOD GROUND UNDER HIM
TATTHERATION TO YOU ALL YOU UNFEELING VAGABONES SAYS HE WHEN HE RECOVERED HIS BREATH AND HE STAGGERED AND SPUN ROUND AND ROUND TILL HE REELED INTO THE STABLE BACK FOREMOST
AND THAT FEARSOME THINGS WERE TO BE SEEN THERE AT NIGHT THE TAILOR WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS BUT HE WAS A SPRIGHTLY MAN AND WHEN THE LAIRD DARED HIM TO MAKE THE TREWS
SO KILHUCH CRAVED OF HIM THE HAND OF OLWEN
AND AFTER MEAT SHE TOLD THEM THAT THE MAIDEN OLWEN CAME THERE EVERY SATURDAY TO WASH THEY PLEDGED THEIR FAITH THAT THEY WOULD NOT HARM HER AND A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO HER SO OLWEN CAME CLOTHED IN A ROBE OF FLAME COLOURED SILK
WITH THAT THE KING WHISTLED AND DOWN CAME THE POOR GOOSE JUST LIKE A HOUND WADDLING UP TO THE POOR CRIPPLE HER MASTER AND AS LIKE HIM AS TWO PEAS THE MINUTE THE SAINT CLAPT HIS EYES ON THE GOOSE I'LL DO THE JOB FOR YOU SAYS HE KING O'TOOLE
HIS FOLLOWERS THEN SAID UNTO ARTHUR LORD GO THOU HOME THOU CANST NOT PROCEED WITH THY HOST IN QUEST OF SUCH SMALL ADVENTURES AS THESE THEN SAID ARTHUR
HAST THOU BOILED THAT YOUNGSTER FOR ME HE CRIED HE'S NOT DONE YET SAID SHE AND I CRIED OUT FROM THE CALDRON MAMMY MAMMY IT'S BOILING I AM
BUT THE ASS RECEIVED HIM WITH A KICK ON THE BROADEST PART OF HIS SMALL CLOTHES AND LAID HIM COMFORTABLY ON THE DUNGHILL WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HAPPENED HIM
HE HAVING WHAT WAS ABOVE THE BEND OF THE TWO SHOULDERS ABOVE THE MEN OF ERIN ALL THE THREE BROTHERS WENT PAST WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF THEM WITHOUT EVEN GLANCING AT THE YOUNG GIRLS ON THE HILLOCK WHAT HAPPENED BUT
